00:02:38.617,00:02:41.036,Truck looks great. There must be a fuckin' fortune here.
00:02:41.244,00:02:44.081,"I know. Let's not in front of him, all right? Just… Hey, no problem, no problem."
00:02:44.665,00:02:46.416,"Now, tell me somethin', fellas, what's goin' on? Shit!"
00:02:46.500,00:02:48.752,"-I've been here too long. Talk to me. -Just give us a minute, okay?"
00:02:48.835,00:02:49.878,"Nah, I ain't got no more minutes."
00:02:49.961,00:02:51.463,"Here, check this out, I want you to see somethin'."
00:02:51.463,00:02:52.881,You can't get no cleaner in here. Look here.
00:02:52.964,00:02:54.466,These are very popular cigarettes with the children.
00:02:54.549,00:02:56.389,You know what this is in here? You know what this is?
00:02:56.501,00:02:58.044,This is a federal tax stamp. You can't beat that.
00:02:58.114,00:02:59.846,You can't get no cleaner than that. Talk to me! Tell me something!
00:02:59.930,00:03:02.641,"So why don't you keep them, go into business yourself, if it's such a great fucking deal."
00:03:02.724,00:03:04.267,"I would, man, but I ain't from Detroit, you know?"
00:03:04.351,00:03:08.021,"I don't know nobody in town that can handle a job this big, but y'all supposed to got all the connections, you know."
00:03:08.105,00:03:09.356,"Tell me something, shit. I'm a businessman."
00:03:09.439,00:03:10.732,I'm gonna sit down. Do what you wanna do.
00:03:10.816,00:03:12.484,"You're right, it ain't easy to get rid of this shit."
00:03:12.653,00:03:14.611,"I know, but see, I'm a businessman, you know. This is my thing."
00:03:14.695,00:03:15.696,I'm doing business here.
00:03:15.779,00:03:17.781,Warm up the truck. Let's get the fuck out of here.
00:03:20.367,00:03:21.743,Here you go. That's what I'm talking about.
00:03:21.827,00:03:23.995,-You're a sharp kid. I like you. -Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
00:03:24.413,00:03:26.373,"Cousin, my man, don't dash yet."
00:03:26.456,00:03:28.709,"Um, this looks like two grand to me, doesn't look like 5,000 dollars."
00:03:28.834,00:03:30.460,"-Gimme, let me see that. -The deal is for 5,000."
00:03:30.544,00:03:32.254,"-That's about 2,000 there you can't sell. -You know what?"
00:03:32.337,00:03:35.382,This pisses me off. I told my people there's supposed to be five grand here.
00:03:35.590,00:03:37.342,And look at this shit. They stiffed us.
00:03:37.634,00:03:39.302,"No, they stiffed you, 'cause I want my money, man."
00:03:39.386,00:03:41.263,"Son of a bitch, you know. You can't count on anybody today."
00:03:41.346,00:03:43.974,"But look, I'll tell you what, let's not fucking hassle about it now."
00:03:44.099,00:03:48.103,"Take the two fucking grand, and on the next score, I promise I'll make it up to you."
00:03:48.186,00:03:49.646,"Look, man, don't jerk me off, all right, man?"
00:03:49.730,00:03:53.650,"Jerk somebody else off. This is bullshit. I need 5,000 dollars not 2,000 dollars."
00:03:53.734,00:03:55.819,"-That's insane, man. Don't do this to me. -Look, don't be unreasonable."
00:03:55.902,00:03:57.446,You're not dealing with Johnny Bananas. Come on.
00:03:57.612,00:04:00.115,"Nah, I have no idea what Johnny Bananas, but can I have my money?"
00:04:00.198,00:04:06.621,"No, look, can I say it slow for you? Look, I need 5,000-- Five thousand dollars. Read my lips. Five thousand dollars is what I need."
00:04:06.705,00:04:08.457,This is bullshit here. I can't do nothing with that.
00:04:08.582,00:04:11.918,"You wanna be a fucking asshole, you can take the whole load and smoke 'em yourself in the park."
00:04:12.043,00:04:14.629,I don't smoke Lucky Strike. I smoke King Size Kent.
00:04:17.799,00:04:20.135,"Fuck this. Nice doin' business with you, kid."
00:04:21.344,00:04:22.763,"Hey, buddy. What you doing here?"
00:04:22.971,00:04:24.639,"Officer, you know what just happened a few minutes ago?"
00:04:24.765,00:04:26.349,You ain't going to believe this shit. Check this out.
00:04:26.475,00:04:29.144,"The truck, it just stopped, man. It just stopped!"
00:04:29.269,00:04:30.771,"You got some jumper cables, you give me a jump?"
00:04:31.605,00:04:35.525,"-Hey, uh, don't I know you from someplace? -No, man, that ain't me, I'm from Buffalo."
00:04:39.488,00:04:41.448,"Both of you guys, break out some ID."
00:04:45.827,00:04:47.329,Let's get the fuck outta here!
00:06:21.923,00:08:09.280,"The fu… Foley, we should have known it was you!"
00:08:16.079,00:08:18.039,"Hey, Axel! Way to go!"
00:08:18.289,00:08:20.041,"-I don't understand. -I don't have time for you today, Jeff."
00:08:20.125,00:08:21.793,Todd's looking for you. He is really pissed.
00:08:22.043,00:08:23.712,You know what he said? This is your worst fuck-up ever.
00:08:23.920,00:08:25.255,"Personally, I don't think that's true."
00:08:25.922,00:08:27.799,"-He's not in there. -Yeah, I see that, Jeff. Thanks."
00:08:27.882,00:08:30.844,"You know, if you'd busted these guys, maybe he wouldn't have been so mad."
00:08:30.969,00:08:33.013,"Now, I heard you got caught up haggling for money or something?"
00:08:33.096,00:08:34.264,"Look, 2,000 dollars wasn't enough money."
00:08:34.347,00:08:36.307,"If I would've took it, those guys would know I was a cop."
00:08:36.474,00:08:38.059,-Leave me alone. -…Another ass hole.
00:08:38.143,00:08:39.561,Where you going? Don't go anywhere.
00:08:39.686,00:08:44.691,"-You asshole. -I'm not saying you did anything wrong, I'm just saying, if you had busted these guys, it would have worked out better."
00:08:44.774,00:08:46.317,That's all I'm saying. Where you going now?
00:08:46.401,00:08:48.111,I'm gonna go get my shit and get out of here.
00:08:48.194,00:08:49.070,No. Big mistake. Big mistake.
00:08:49.154,00:08:50.196,-You want my advice? -No.
00:08:50.321,00:08:52.115,"-Know what I'd do if I was you? -No, I don't."
00:08:52.198,00:08:54.492,"Go in there, talk to him. Wait for him. He is gonna be right back."
00:08:54.617,00:08:57.120,"Jeff, get away from me. I'm gonna shoot you, all right? Don't have time for you."
00:08:57.203,00:08:59.330,"I'm not telling you what to do, but you know what I would do?"
00:08:59.456,00:09:01.541,"Just lighten up. I'm not listening to you, okay?"
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.793,You're making it a lot worse for yourself.
00:09:03.877,00:09:05.879,"Oh, thank you. Look at this. This is great, now. Thank you, guys."
00:09:06.004,00:09:07.672,"Hey, Axel, you got a cigarette?"
00:09:09.466,00:09:12.135,-Did you write that one? -That's what I'm trying to tell you.
00:09:12.218,00:09:14.137,It's not a secret. Everybody knows about you and the truck.
00:09:14.220,00:09:15.513,"You know, Jeffrey, will you listen to me?"
00:09:15.597,00:09:17.557,Listen. I am not listening to you. I am ignoring you.
00:09:20.894,00:09:23.563,"I am not listening to Jeffrey, but he's still talking!"
00:09:23.646,00:09:26.524,-I am not listening to you! -I really hate when you do that.
00:09:26.649,00:09:28.068,"-Then stop, then, all right? -It's childish."
00:09:35.742,00:09:40.538,You mind telling me where the fuck you come off going undercover without authorization from me? What the fuck is this all about?
00:09:40.747,00:09:44.709,"You want to play some fucking bullshit cowboy cop, go do it in somebody else's precinct!"
00:09:45.210,00:09:48.004,-Do you wanna hear my side of the story? -What's your fucking side of the story?
00:09:50.507,00:09:51.633,Let's hear your side of the story.
00:09:51.716,00:09:53.927,"Hey, Axel, I'm not taking any more of this shit from you."
00:09:54.052,00:09:56.471,Do you know how much this little stunt of yours is going to cost this city?
00:09:56.596,00:09:58.306,"I don't think cost is the issue here, sir."
00:09:58.389,00:10:01.267,I think the issue should be my blatant disregard for proper procedure.
00:10:01.518,00:10:03.603,"You're damn right, wise-ass!"
00:10:03.812,00:10:08.316,"The mayor called the chief, the chief called the deputy chief, and the deputy chief just chewed my ass out."
00:10:08.441,00:10:10.485,"You see I don't have any bit of it left, don't you?"
00:10:11.111,00:10:14.030,"Where in the fuck did you get a truckload of cigarettes from, anyway?"
00:10:14.280,00:10:15.615,From the Dearborn hijack.
00:10:15.865,00:10:18.451,The Dearborn hijack? That fucking bust went down last week.
00:10:18.660,00:10:20.703,That truck is supposed to be in the damn pound.
00:10:20.954,00:10:21.830,I tried to tell you.
00:10:21.913,00:10:23.790,"Jeffrey, this is none of your fucking business."
00:10:23.873,00:10:24.874,This is not my locker.
00:10:25.458,00:10:28.837,"Listen, Axel. No more of these set-ups, you understand?"
00:10:29.254,00:10:33.466,"You're a good cop and you got great potential, but you don't know every fucking thing."
00:10:34.134,00:10:36.594,And I'm tired of taking the heat for your ass.
00:10:37.053,00:10:38.847,"One more time, and you're out on the street."
00:10:39.180,00:10:42.684,"-Do you understand me? -Look, boss, let me tell you-- Do you understand me?"
00:10:44.686,00:10:51.651,"Yeah, I understand. Boss… The chief ain't chew it all out. You still got a little ass there."
00:10:52.485,00:10:56.948,"Don't fuck with me, Axel. Not now. Go on, go home."
00:12:17.028,00:12:17.904,Hey!
00:12:24.661,00:12:26.246,"How you doing, man? How you doing?"
00:12:26.496,00:12:27.789,-How you doing? -All right!
00:12:27.914,00:12:29.624,"I see, you're still breaking in people's houses."
00:12:29.791,00:12:30.875,What do you expect with that lock?
00:12:30.959,00:12:32.794,"Why don't you buy a real fucking lock for that door, huh?"
00:12:33.086,00:12:35.672,I don't need no lock. I got my pistol. I'll pop a cap in somebody.
00:12:35.922,00:12:38.299,"I can't afford no electrical bill, though. Close my refrigerator."
00:12:38.383,00:12:40.426,You got groceries and shit on this side. Damn.
00:12:40.677,00:12:43.263,"-So what's up, man? Look at you! -Yeah!"
00:12:43.346,00:12:45.848,"-Yo, man, when did you get out? -I walked out six months ago."
00:12:46.891,00:12:48.851,"You got out six months ago, you're just coming to see me now?"
00:12:49.560,00:12:54.023,"They got me out a year early, for you know, good time, and I went out to California, get some sun."
00:12:54.107,00:12:55.441,I gotta show… I gotta show you something.
00:12:55.608,00:12:58.319,"A couple hours… I ain't seen you in two years, man. What's up?"
00:13:03.199,00:13:04.534,Ten thousand Deutschmarks.
00:13:04.659,00:13:06.244,-Deutschmark? -Yeah.
00:13:06.661,00:13:07.537,What is that?
00:13:07.620,00:13:10.248,They're bearer bonds. They're bonds. Untraceable.
00:13:11.040,00:13:12.041,You stole 'em?
00:13:15.003,00:13:16.504,I don't even-- I'm sorry I even asked.
00:13:16.754,00:13:18.756,"-It's just good to see you, man. -I missed you, man."
00:13:18.840,00:13:19.966,-Yeah. -I missed you.
00:13:20.925,00:13:22.552,"What were you doing in California, anyway?"
00:13:23.678,00:13:25.346,-Working where? -Guess.
00:13:25.680,00:13:27.974,"-I don't know, where were you working? -Beverly Hills."
00:13:32.186,00:13:34.814,-What? -I was a security guard.
00:13:41.070,00:13:43.573,-Jenny Summers. -Jenny Summers?
00:13:44.574,00:13:46.367,"Oh, man, I haven't seen Jenny in years."
00:13:46.451,00:13:48.995,"-What's she up to? -She's doing great, right?"
00:13:49.120,00:13:50.580,She's a manager of this art gallery.
00:13:50.663,00:13:53.583,The Hollis Benton Art Gallery out in Beverly Hills.
00:13:54.167,00:13:57.086,"It's like a world-famous place, all right? Ever hear of it?"
00:13:57.211,00:13:58.588,"Yeah, I buy all my art there."
00:14:02.467,00:14:04.969,-Fifty bucks you don't make that shot. -Bullshit.
00:14:05.261,00:14:06.804,-A hundred. -You got a bet.
00:14:15.855,00:14:16.981,What are you gonna do? Huh?
00:14:17.065,00:14:19.067,You're still just as bright as you've always been.
00:14:19.442,00:14:23.196,"Twenty, 40, 60, 80, take it. Have a party."
00:14:23.279,00:14:24.530,Pleasure doing business with you.
00:14:28.910,00:14:31.371,"Miss, excuse me. Two more Scotch and sodas."
00:14:35.792,00:14:38.294,I got a great idea. I got a great idea!
00:14:40.463,00:14:41.672,Let's steal a car.
00:14:45.218,00:14:46.344,Are you serious?
00:14:47.178,00:14:48.346,I'm a fucking police officer!
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.431,"I can't steal cars no more, man, what's wrong with you?"
00:14:50.515,00:14:53.393,"So what? How many times have you stolen a car, man?"
00:15:06.906,00:15:09.659,"Also, I remember you had to go to jail for hiding that shit, too."
00:15:10.118,00:15:11.869,"That wasn't jail, it was a state school."
00:15:12.245,00:15:14.622,A state school is jail when you're 15 years old.
00:15:14.705,00:15:18.543,"That ain't jail, man. That's like day camp compared to jail."
00:15:20.253,00:15:22.255,"Yo, how come you didn't tell on me when you got caught, man?"
00:15:22.338,00:15:23.714,How come you didn't tell them we were together?
00:15:23.840,00:15:24.715,You don't know?
00:15:28.428,00:15:30.012,-You don't know? -No.
00:15:33.391,00:15:34.600,"It's because I love you, man."
00:15:47.196,00:15:50.158,"Hold still. Mike, I gotta open the door, okay? Balance yourself."
00:15:50.241,00:15:58.416,"-Oh. -Okay? Here we go, Mike… I'm opening the door now, okay? Here we go. All right. Here we go."
00:15:58.708,00:15:59.625,Axel!
00:16:08.176,00:16:09.135,"What's up, Zack?"
00:16:16.976,00:16:19.520,"I swear to Christ, Zack, I was gonna bring 'em back."
00:16:19.979,00:16:21.814,-You get lost? -No.
00:16:26.986,00:16:28.905,-Huh? -What the fuck are you doing?
00:16:29.822,00:16:31.282,"What am I supposed to do here, Mikey?"
00:16:31.616,00:16:34.285,"Zack, there was a whole box full of those things they gave me."
00:16:34.368,00:16:36.704,I took a couple of them. I didn't think anybody was gonna miss them.
00:16:37.038,00:16:39.457,-I figured I'd take 'em… -Shut up.
00:16:40.249,00:16:42.627,"-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -No, shut up."
00:16:45.379,00:16:47.131,"-Man, please. -Just shut up, Mikey."
00:16:56.516,00:17:02.271,"I swear if you ever show your face out there again… Oh, man, I won't-- -Ever. -I won't."
00:17:02.480,00:17:05.233,"-Ever. -I won't. I promise you, man. I'm sorry."
00:17:05.900,00:17:07.985,"-I fucked up, I'm sorry. -Okay."
00:17:08.444,00:17:09.654,-I'm sorry. -Okay.
00:17:09.946,00:17:11.489,-Ever. -I'm sorry.
00:17:38.266,00:17:43.020,"Axel, I thought I told you to go to the hospital and get that bump on your head checked out."
00:17:43.271,00:17:46.440,"-My head is all right, man. -It's not a request, Axel."
00:17:59.287,00:18:02.415,-…any statements anywhere -Boss. Can I talk to you for a minute?
00:18:03.583,00:18:06.377,"Look, I heard a rumor that you're gonna use Rand on this case."
00:18:06.460,00:18:08.588,"In between the two of us, the guy doesn't know the time of day."
00:18:08.963,00:18:10.631,"Don't mess with me now, Axel."
00:18:10.923,00:18:13.551,It's the first time he's left his desk in 12 years.
00:18:13.718,00:18:15.928,At least he's had 12 years.
00:18:16.554,00:18:19.473,"Anyway, it's a homicide case, and it belongs to Rand."
00:18:19.932,00:18:21.183,"Now, go to the hospital."
00:18:21.934,00:18:23.811,"You don't mind if I ask around a little bit, do you?"
00:18:23.894,00:18:28.232,Don't do a damn thing. It's Rand's case. Your ass is skating on thin ice as it is.
00:18:28.524,00:18:30.693,"Hey, look, we're talking about a friend of mine here!"
00:18:31.360,00:18:35.323,"Yes, we are, aren't we? Now, let's take a close look at that."
00:18:35.698,00:18:39.619,"One, a hoodlum friend. Two, a professional hit."
00:18:40.036,00:18:41.996,"Three, in a cop's apartment."
00:18:42.371,00:18:44.707,This whole thing stinks to high heaven.
00:18:45.124,00:18:46.584,How do you know it was a professional hit?
00:18:47.001,00:18:49.795,I didn't just walk into this town from the cotton fields.
00:18:49.920,00:18:53.215,Whoever killed your friend wasn't worried about your little narrow ass.
00:18:53.466,00:18:56.802,"If they were, you'd be lying beside him in that meat wagon."
00:18:57.470,00:19:00.056,Just don't do a damn thing. Stay out of this.
00:19:00.139,00:19:02.224,"Well, look, I got some vacation time coming to me."
00:19:02.308,00:19:03.726,I want to take my vacation now.
00:19:05.061,00:19:06.687,"Stay away from this case, Axel."
00:19:06.979,00:19:09.315,"Nah, it's just that I feel I need a little vacation, that's all."
00:19:14.320,00:19:17.823,"All right, as soon as you finish at the hospital, you're on vacation."
00:19:17.990,00:19:18.949,Thank you.
00:19:19.659,00:19:24.830,"But if you decide to butt into this case, it'll be the longest vacation you ever heard of."
00:20:56.505,00:21:00.050,"-Checking in today, sir? -That depends. This hotel real expensive?"
00:21:00.468,00:21:02.970,Not for Beverly Hills. Can I get your bags for you?
00:21:06.557,00:21:07.808,"Yeah, that's my bag in the front seat."
00:21:20.112,00:21:22.615,"I'm sorry, sir, we just have nothing available tonight."
00:21:23.449,00:21:27.203,"May I suggest next time that you call for a reservation, you do it least a week in advance?"
00:21:28.287,00:21:29.246,Thank you.
00:21:32.917,00:21:33.834,May I help you?
00:21:33.959,00:21:36.128,"Yes, see if you have a reservation for an Axel Foley?"
00:21:36.337,00:21:37.296,"Well, let's see."
00:21:40.174,00:21:42.009,"I'm sorry, I don't see anything under that name."
00:21:42.468,00:21:47.723,"Uh. Check Rolling Stone magazine's Axel Foley, that's what it is."
00:21:49.475,00:21:50.392,Okay.
00:21:51.477,00:21:54.605,"No, no Rolling Stone, no Axel Foley. I'm sorry, sir."
00:21:54.855,00:21:57.233,"Oh, it's all right. You guys probably just made some mistake with reservations."
00:21:57.358,00:21:59.693,"Why don't you just give me another room, I'll go up and go to sleep."
00:21:59.819,00:22:02.279,"I'm sorry, sir, but there are no rooms available."
00:22:04.740,00:22:07.243,"Don't you think I realize what's going on here, miss?"
00:22:07.368,00:22:08.619,-Who do you think I am? -I'm sorry.
00:22:08.744,00:22:16.585,"Don't you think I know that if I was some hotshot from out of town that pulled inside here, and you guys made a reservation mistake, I'd be the first one to get a room, and I'd be upstairs relaxing right now?"
00:22:16.919,00:22:25.803,"But I'm not some hotshot from out of town, I'm a small reporter from Rolling Stone magazine that's in town to do an exclusive interview with Michael Jackson that's gonna be picked up by every major magazine in the country."
00:22:26.011,00:22:29.515,"I was gonna call the article, Michael Jackson is Sitting on Top of the World."
00:22:29.598,00:22:36.647,"But now I think I might as well just call it, Michael Jackson Can Sit on Top of the World, Just as Long as He Doesn't Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel, because There's No Niggers Allowed in There!"
00:22:36.981,00:22:40.568,"Excuse me, sir, it seems that we do have a last-minute cancellation."
00:22:40.860,00:22:46.365,"Uh, there is a room available. It's a suite, but I'll only charge you the single-room rate."
00:22:47.116,00:22:48.367,Thank you. I'm sorry I got upset.
00:22:48.534,00:22:50.536,"It's probably from jet lag or something, I'm very tired."
00:22:52.121,00:22:54.164,"Uh, that'll be 235 dollars a night, sir."
00:22:59.211,00:23:00.588,Fine. Fine.
00:23:01.213,00:23:03.924,-And that'll be suite 1035. -Thank you very much.
00:23:04.049,00:23:05.217,"-Yes, sir. -Thank you."
00:23:07.636,00:23:09.555,"If Michael calls, tell him what room I'm in."
00:24:16.121,00:24:18.916,I'm fine. My name is Serge and how can I help you?
00:24:19.333,00:24:22.044,"Um, yeah, I'm looking for Miss Jenny Summers."
00:24:23.712,00:24:26.423,She's very busy today. Maybe you give me your name?
00:24:27.132,00:24:29.635,-My name's Axel Foley. -And what it's pertaining?
00:24:30.803,00:24:35.349,"-I didn't understand what you said. -Pertaining, what it's meaning, regarding."
00:24:35.641,00:24:38.143,"Oh, what's it regarding? I'm an old acquaintance of hers."
00:24:38.727,00:24:39.687,Donny.
00:24:40.521,00:24:41.605,One moment.
00:24:44.233,00:24:51.115,"Donny, run and tell Miss Summers that Mr. Ahmed Farley's here to-- -No, Axel Foley. Axel. -Ahmel-- Ahwell… Axel."
00:24:52.449,00:24:55.202,Foley's here to see her. He's an old acquaintance.
00:24:55.828,00:24:57.287,"Donny, this-- Cover this up."
00:24:57.371,00:25:00.916,-I'm sorry. I'm real sorry. -It's like the breast of a dog to scrub for the customer.
00:25:01.166,00:25:03.585,"-It's not sexy, it's animal. -No, it's not sexy at all."
00:25:03.877,00:25:09.216,"May I offer you something to drink? Wine, a cocktail, uh… espresso?"
00:25:10.009,00:25:11.218,"No, I'm fine, thank you."
00:25:11.301,00:25:13.595,"I make it myself right back there, with a little lemon twist."
00:25:13.679,00:25:16.390,"-It's good. You should try it. -No, I'm… I'm fine."
00:25:17.391,00:25:18.642,I see you look at this piece.
00:25:18.851,00:25:21.562,"Yeah, I was wondering how something like this went for."
00:25:21.687,00:25:23.313,One hundred and thirty thousand dollar.
00:25:23.397,00:25:25.357,"-Get the fuck outta here! -No, I cannot!"
00:25:25.441,00:25:27.901,"It's serious, because it's a very important piece."
00:25:28.193,00:25:31.071,-Have you ever sold one of these? -Sold it yesterday to a collector.
00:25:31.155,00:25:33.907,"-Get the fuck outta here! -No, I'm serious! I sell it myself!"
00:25:34.950,00:25:37.161,"Axel Foley, what on Earth are you doing here?"
00:25:37.369,00:25:38.245,How you doing?
00:25:38.495,00:25:40.789,"I'm fine! Hold on a second, I'll be right down."
00:25:41.331,00:25:43.000,"Great. Excuse me, Serge."
00:25:47.629,00:25:49.965,"-Oh, God, it's good to see you! -Yeah!"
00:25:50.049,00:25:51.216,How've you been?
00:25:51.300,00:25:53.052,-I've been-- Look at you! -You like?
00:25:53.135,00:25:54.386,-Yeah! -Is it great?
00:25:54.511,00:25:56.180,-You're getting old. -Fuck you.
00:25:59.183,00:26:01.518,"-Peach fuzz. -No, that's man style now."
00:26:03.437,00:26:05.105,Do you have someplace where we can talk real quick?
00:26:05.481,00:26:07.900,"Well, yeah. Uh… right over there."
00:26:08.067,00:26:08.984,-Great. -Come on.
00:26:09.193,00:26:11.612,"-I can't believe how you've filled out. -Yeah, I filled out."
00:26:11.695,00:26:12.821,"No, it looks good, though."
00:26:17.785,00:26:21.080,"-I want to talk to you about Mikey. -Oh, is he in trouble again?"
00:26:24.541,00:26:25.542,He's dead.
00:26:28.337,00:26:29.213,What?
00:26:30.589,00:26:32.966,He's dead. He came into Detroit and somebody killed him.
00:26:48.148,00:26:50.859,"Look, I can't right now. I'll be up in a second."
00:26:54.947,00:26:57.241,Mikey mentioned that you helped him get a job.
00:26:58.784,00:27:06.708,"Yeah, uh… Who's this guy?"
00:27:07.918,00:27:09.211,His name is Victor Maitland.
00:27:10.462,00:27:13.590,He was working for Victor at the gallery's warehouse.
00:27:15.259,00:27:17.177,"Look, Axel, I can't talk right now, I have to go upstairs."
00:27:17.553,00:27:23.100,"That's cool. Um… I'll call you later on, we'll get together later and talk, okay?"
00:27:23.392,00:27:24.268,Sure.
00:27:26.478,00:27:27.354,Be good.
00:27:38.323,00:27:39.491,I have a delivery for Victor Maitland.
00:27:39.700,00:27:41.785,"Oh, I'll take it right upstairs to him."
00:27:42.161,00:27:43.579,Maybe I should give it to him myself.
00:27:43.829,00:27:46.331,"Uh, well, deliveries are supposed to be left on my desk."
00:27:46.415,00:27:48.250,"Yeah, but he has to get these flowers. It's imperative."
00:27:48.333,00:27:49.418,I'm gonna go up myself. All right?
00:27:51.253,00:27:53.922,"Yeah, but floral delivery is my life. I have to take it up. Thank you."
00:27:54.798,00:27:55.674,Who let you in here?
00:27:55.966,00:27:56.925,I let myself in.
00:27:57.885,00:28:01.471,How you doing? I have to ask you some questions about Michael Tandino.
00:28:09.271,00:28:12.316,"And what, may I ask, is your interest in Mr. Tandino?"
00:28:12.566,00:28:13.775,"Well, he was my best friend."
00:28:14.026,00:28:15.861,He came to see me in Detroit a couple of days ago.
00:28:16.528,00:28:18.780,"And a couple hours after he got there, someone killed him."
00:28:19.448,00:28:21.992,"Oh, my God. That's terrible."
00:28:22.534,00:28:23.452,It's fucked up.
00:28:26.038,00:28:29.166,And? What do you wish to know?
00:28:30.500,00:28:33.212,"-He worked for you, didn't he? -Yes. Yes, he did."
00:28:34.379,00:28:35.380,Good gracious!
00:28:37.007,00:28:40.135,I'm really sorry to hear this. Would you like to sit down?
00:28:40.385,00:28:42.179,Can I get you anything?
00:28:43.180,00:28:44.097,"No, I'm all right."
00:28:44.681,00:28:46.934,"Well, how on earth did this happen?"
00:28:47.809,00:28:50.354,"Detroit is a very violent city, isn't it?"
00:28:53.857,00:28:54.816,"Yeah, it is."
00:28:55.067,00:28:59.529,"Well, I do hope the police have procured some intelligent leads."
00:29:01.949,00:29:04.201,Exactly what was it Mikey did for you here?
00:29:06.578,00:29:08.872,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name."
00:29:09.665,00:29:10.707,My name is Foley.
00:29:11.541,00:29:19.508,"Excuse me, Mr. Foley, if I appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in Detroit."
00:29:20.175,00:29:23.637,"So, if you'll forgive me, I really must get back to work."
00:29:23.804,00:29:29.643,"Look, all I want to know is-- -Get the fuck off me. -Hey, take it easy."
00:29:29.726,00:29:33.647,"Get the fuck off me! Get off me, man! Get off me! Get the fuck off me."
00:29:41.238,00:29:44.116,"Get the fuck off me. You think I'm playing games, man?"
00:29:44.366,00:29:46.451,"Hey! Hey, I'm fucking somebody up."
00:29:52.916,00:29:53.875,Hey!
00:29:56.211,00:29:57.337,What the fuck is this shit?
00:30:02.509,00:30:04.845,Did you see that shit? I can describe all of them.
00:30:05.137,00:30:07.472,"Please move to the side of the car, put your hands on the hood."
00:30:07.848,00:30:08.765,"Why, what's with you guys?"
00:30:08.890,00:30:10.892,"You heard what he said, sir. Do it right now, please."
00:30:12.311,00:30:15.063,"What kind of shit is this, man? Hold up. Wait a second."
00:30:15.272,00:30:18.275,You guys are arresting me for getting thrown out of a fucking window?
00:30:18.775,00:30:20.777,"I got thrown out of a window, man!"
00:30:21.361,00:30:22.487,"Gun, partner!"
00:30:24.197,00:30:27.117,"Sir, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent."
00:30:27.200,00:30:30.078,Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
00:30:30.370,00:30:32.539,You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning.
00:30:32.706,00:30:34.624,"Yeah, I understand. I understand the rights."
00:30:35.208,00:30:37.586,"I know this is bullshit, though, man. I got thrown out of a fucking window."
00:30:39.129,00:30:40.505,"Yeah, but tell me something, what's the charge?"
00:30:40.756,00:30:43.675,Possession of a concealed weapon and disturbing the peace.
00:30:43.925,00:30:46.428,Disturbing the peace? I got thrown out of a window!
00:30:46.511,00:30:49.056,"What's the fucking charge for getting pushed out of a moving car, huh?"
00:30:49.139,00:30:51.183,Jaywalking? This is bullshit!
00:30:58.648,00:31:02.569,"You know, this is the cleanest and nicest police car I've ever been in in my life."
00:31:03.862,00:31:04.946,This thing's nicer than my apartment.
00:31:09.159,00:31:15.165,"Officers, if we see any like, um, movie stars, could y'all stop to point them out to me? I've never seen no shit like that."
00:31:15.290,00:31:16.500,"That's enough talking, pal."
00:31:17.084,00:31:18.001,"Okay, that's cool."
00:31:26.927,00:31:28.178,This is nice.
00:31:33.683,00:31:36.812,It's about time. I thought you guys forgot I was here. I was getting hungry.
00:31:37.020,00:31:38.855,I've never been into a cell that had a phone in it.
00:31:39.106,00:31:40.982,Could I stay for a while? 'Cause I ordered some pizza?
00:32:08.343,00:32:09.553,"Have a seat right over there, please."
00:32:17.352,00:32:20.480,"I'm Sergeant Taggart and this is my partner, Detective Rosewood."
00:32:21.773,00:32:24.109,Do you always treat visitors from out of town like this?
00:32:27.612,00:32:30.991,Why didn't you identify yourself as a police officer when you were arrested?
00:32:31.324,00:32:32.909,'Cause I was minding my own business.
00:32:33.034,00:32:36.288,Where the fuck do you guys get off on arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
00:32:36.538,00:32:41.376,"We have six witnesses that say you broke in and started tearing up the place, then jumped out the window."
00:32:42.461,00:32:45.380,"And you guys believe that? What the fuck are you, cops or doormen?"
00:32:45.714,00:32:51.303,We're more likely to believe an important local businessman than a foul-mouthed jerk from out of town.
00:32:51.386,00:32:53.680,"Foul-mouthed? Fuck you, man."
00:32:56.683,00:32:57.601,"See, watch your mouth."
00:32:57.893,00:32:59.895,"Hey, man, don't square off on me with some bullshit."
00:33:00.020,00:33:00.896,You wanna start some static?
00:33:00.979,00:33:02.647,"-Hey, don't push me! -Fuck you, man!"
00:33:04.107,00:33:05.150,Taggart!
00:33:07.194,00:33:08.111,"Yes, sir."
00:33:09.196,00:33:10.197,Come here.
00:33:27.005,00:33:30.842,Sir… I apologize for striking you.
00:33:33.178,00:33:34.262,I have no excuse.
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.059,Forget about it.
00:33:39.768,00:33:43.939,"Detective Foley, I am Lieutenant Bogomil of the Beverly Hills Police Department."
00:33:44.439,00:33:46.358,Do you wish to file charges against Sergeant Taggart?
00:33:49.027,00:33:50.362,"This is some kind of joke, right?"
00:33:50.779,00:33:53.907,Do you wish to file charges against this officer for assault?
00:33:55.033,00:33:58.411,"Look, where I'm from cops don't file charges against other cops."
00:33:59.538,00:34:00.622,"No, I don't want to do that."
00:34:02.582,00:34:05.126,"Well, in Beverly Hills, we go strictly by the book."
00:34:06.711,00:34:08.755,"Now, why didn't you inform us when you came to town?"
00:34:09.506,00:34:10.507,I'm on vacation.
00:34:11.091,00:34:14.511,"If you're on vacation, what business did you have in Victor Maitland's office?"
00:34:14.928,00:34:18.265,"I had to go to the bathroom. I was walking by, it looked like a nice clean place, so I stopped."
00:34:21.351,00:34:22.811,You always take your gun on vacation?
00:34:23.478,00:34:25.480,"Well, I don't know. I've never been on vacation before."
00:34:26.022,00:34:28.900,"But in Detroit, cops are required to carry a firearm at all times."
00:34:29.317,00:34:31.736,"Well, if you want to carry a gun, I suggest you go back there."
00:34:33.488,00:34:35.115,-if you wanna know the truth. -Is that so?
00:34:35.657,00:34:38.118,I just got off the phone with an Inspector Todd in Detroit.
00:34:38.743,00:34:39.953,Does that name ring a bell?
00:34:42.998,00:34:43.957,He's my boss.
00:34:44.791,00:34:46.918,He tells me you may not be very welcome back there.
00:34:48.753,00:34:50.880,He says that you're an outstanding young detective.
00:34:52.257,00:34:54.259,I find that very difficult to believe.
00:34:54.759,00:34:55.760,But it's true though.
00:34:56.261,00:34:58.597,He also says he nearly had to fire you for insubordination.
00:34:58.888,00:35:00.599,I find that very easy to believe.
00:35:02.434,00:35:04.019,"Now, what are you doing in Beverly Hills?"
00:35:04.436,00:35:06.688,"I told you, I'm on vacation. I went to the bathroom."
00:35:06.771,00:35:08.940,"The next thing I knew, six guys threw me out a window."
00:35:09.399,00:35:11.526,Inspector Todd gave me a message for you. Wanna hear it?
00:35:13.570,00:35:14.613,I don't think so.
00:35:14.946,00:35:19.284,"He says, if you're out here investigating the Tandino murder, you needn't bother coming back."
00:35:20.243,00:35:25.707,"He tells me if we inform him you are working on this case, he'll have you brought up on charges and fired."
00:35:27.000,00:35:29.419,"Now, one last time, what are you doing?"
00:35:29.502,00:35:31.880,-I'm on vacation! -Vacation! Vacation.
00:35:33.548,00:35:38.762,"Rosewood, take Mr. Foley over to the courthouse and let him arrange for bail."
00:35:39.929,00:35:40.930,"Would you follow me, sir?"
00:35:42.140,00:35:45.685,"You know, I got to hand it to you guys, if anything, you are extremely polite."
00:35:47.771,00:35:49.022,"Pretty good punch you got there, Taggart."
00:35:54.486,00:35:55.362,After you.
00:35:57.614,00:35:58.490,After you.
00:36:00.200,00:36:02.077,"You guys are so sweet, you know that?"
00:36:03.828,00:36:05.163,"Thanks for bailing me out, Jen."
00:36:05.997,00:36:08.583,"You know if I'd known why you'd been arrested, I wouldn't have come."
00:36:14.130,00:36:17.425,"Axel, if it wasn't for Victor Maitland, I'd be waiting on tables."
00:36:17.509,00:36:22.430,"It just so happens the day that Mikey got killed, he showed up at my apartment with a bag of German bearer bonds."
00:36:22.639,00:36:24.724,"Now, I think he stole them from whoever had him killed."
00:36:24.974,00:36:28.019,"When I mentioned Mikey's name to Maitland, that's when Maitland went nuts and had me thrown out."
00:36:28.144,00:36:33.775,"Axel, you look like a hoodlum. You go barging into his office without an appointment. You're carrying a gun."
00:36:33.900,00:36:37.070,"I mean, if you barged into my office and I didn't know you, I'd throw you out!"
00:36:37.404,00:36:38.488,Is this your car?
00:36:39.072,00:36:42.033,"Oh, no. In Beverly Hills, we just take whichever car's closest."
00:36:42.742,00:36:46.287,I remember you used to drive that crappy blue Chevy Nova.
00:36:47.789,00:36:48.957,What are you driving now?
00:36:49.999,00:36:51.710,The same crappy blue Chevy Nova.
00:36:53.086,00:36:54.754,Do you think it's too late for me to study art?
00:36:54.838,00:36:55.714,"Yeah, I do."
00:36:57.048,00:36:59.259,"Axel, why were you bothering Victor?"
00:37:00.051,00:37:02.721,"You don't think he has anything to do with Mikey getting killed, do you?"
00:37:02.804,00:37:06.891,"Oh, no! No, I was just poking around. I don't think he did nothing."
00:37:07.142,00:37:13.690,"Axel, Victor Maitland is one of the top art dealers in the United States! He has been for ten years."
00:37:13.940,00:37:14.983,I'm impressed.
00:37:20.280,00:37:23.366,"-What are you looking back there for? -The cops, they're following us."
00:37:24.325,00:37:25.201,What?
00:37:26.411,00:37:27.328,Where?
00:37:27.662,00:37:30.707,"In the back, on the right. Beige Ford."
00:37:59.694,00:38:00.945,Can you believe this place?
00:38:02.238,00:38:04.407,"Axel, how can you afford this?"
00:38:04.657,00:38:06.576,They're just charging me the single-room rate.
00:38:06.910,00:38:09.454,"-How can you afford that? -Actually, I can't afford it."
00:38:09.537,00:38:11.206,But you know what they got inside that bathroom?
00:38:11.372,00:38:14.417,They got little robes with little initials of the hotel on it.
00:38:14.667,00:38:16.377,"I love this place, I can't leave this shit."
00:38:17.003,00:38:18.171,I'm gonna steal one of the robes.
00:38:18.254,00:38:19.464,"-You want one? -No, thanks."
00:38:19.547,00:38:20.673,-You want some of the slippers? -No.
00:38:20.799,00:38:22.967,"I'm gonna steal some of them, too. You should take some of this shit."
00:38:23.468,00:38:24.719,"Excuse me, two seconds."
00:38:28.389,00:38:33.019,"Hello, room service? Yes, this is Mr. Axel Foley in suite 1035."
00:38:33.478,00:38:36.231,"Yeah, I'd like to order something from your late-supper menu."
00:38:36.564,00:38:40.151,"But listen, I want you to deliver it to this beige Ford that's parked out on Wilshire."
00:38:40.276,00:38:42.821,Send down one bay shrimp salad sandwich.
00:38:43.571,00:38:44.489,Okay?
00:38:45.365,00:38:48.993,Right. And is the cold poached salmon in dill sauce tasty?
00:38:49.202,00:38:52.747,"Okay, send one of those down, all right? And send down something for dessert."
00:38:52.997,00:38:55.083,Thank you very much. All right. Thank you.
00:38:56.417,00:38:57.627,You're quite a sport.
00:39:01.256,00:39:03.216,I'm gonna be in town until I find out who killed Mikey.
00:39:06.135,00:39:11.015,And I'm very seriously considering going down to that warehouse where he worked and checking that place out.
00:39:11.349,00:39:14.227,"Oh, really? And how are you planning on getting in?"
00:39:35.164,00:39:37.292,"-Good evening, sir. -What the hell is that?"
00:39:37.375,00:39:39.586,"It's late supper, sir. Compliments of Axel Foley."
00:39:40.003,00:39:40.920,Foley?
00:39:41.921,00:39:44.841,-How'd he know we were here? -Because I let you drive.
00:39:45.174,00:39:47.051,I need a couple of bananas. How much are they?
00:39:47.552,00:39:49.596,"Well, the buffet plate is 12.50."
00:39:49.846,00:39:52.849,"You get peaches, plums, oranges and bananas."
00:39:52.932,00:39:54.350,All I need is a couple of bananas.
00:40:00.148,00:40:02.233,"Shh. Go ahead, take those bananas."
00:40:03.359,00:40:04.277,Thank you.
00:40:06.487,00:40:08.197,"Forget it, I'm not eating that. Take it back."
00:40:24.464,00:40:26.549,Could I get some extra mayo?
00:40:26.633,00:40:28.051,"-Certainly, sir. -Thank you."
00:40:29.552,00:40:30.678,-Ready to go? -Yeah.
00:40:32.680,00:40:34.265,There's the Mercedes. Will you get rid of that stuff?
00:41:04.170,00:41:05.171,This the place?
00:41:05.964,00:41:08.424,"Yeah, but I'm still not sure I should do this."
00:41:08.925,00:41:10.093,"Okay, you don't have to do anything."
00:41:10.426,00:41:13.388,"But when you hear glass and shit breaking, don't get scared."
00:41:13.471,00:41:15.556,It's just me kicking in the window. Sit tight.
00:41:17.392,00:41:19.394,"All right. Come on, Axel."
00:42:00.309,00:42:02.186,-Did you find something? -Coffee grounds.
00:42:03.771,00:42:04.647,So?
00:42:06.024,00:42:07.316,You know what this stuff is used for?
00:42:08.109,00:42:10.611,"Yeah, some people filter hot water through it and drink it."
00:42:10.737,00:42:13.614,"Yeah, I'm gonna take this home, filter hot water through it and drink it in the morning."
00:42:31.257,00:42:33.718,"I wanna tell you, I wish you would've been with me last night."
00:42:42.727,00:42:45.271,"Some guy comes in, he sits down a couple of stools away."
00:42:45.772,00:42:49.859,He's got one of them eyes that's going like this.
00:42:50.651,00:42:53.154,I didn't know if he was trying to put the make on me or what.
00:42:53.321,00:42:58.284,"So, I thought I'd take you over there tonight, let him have a little shot at you before I tore his head off."
00:43:12.090,00:43:14.425,-Just get off my back. -Come on.
00:43:19.055,00:43:20.014,I got it.
00:43:37.532,00:43:39.951,"-Axel, what the hell's going on? -I'll tell you later. Come on."
00:43:41.869,00:43:43.162,-Hurry up. -Hurry up.
00:43:43.496,00:43:46.332,-Give me the key. I'm gonna follow him. -Have you ever driven a Mercedes before?
00:43:46.415,00:43:48.459,"No, but a car is a car. I drive my car every day."
00:43:49.001,00:43:52.338,"-I'm driving, I've seen your car. -Oh, shit. That's cold."
00:44:00.513,00:44:02.014,A banana in your tailpipe.
00:44:02.098,00:44:05.017,How could you not notice a man sticking a banana in your tailpipe?
00:44:05.101,00:44:07.145,"-Well, he distracted us, sir. -And how'd he do that?"
00:44:07.270,00:44:13.151,"Well, he sent us a late supper, sir. See, this waiter comes over-- Billy, he gets the point."
00:44:13.484,00:44:14.527,A late supper?
00:44:16.279,00:44:17.613,"And what did you have, Rosewood?"
00:44:19.157,00:44:23.536,"I think it was a shrimp… salad sandwich, sir."
00:44:23.953,00:44:26.247,"-A shrimp salad sandwich? -Yes, sir."
00:44:30.168,00:44:33.254,I want you two to go back to the hotel and wait for Foley to show up.
00:44:34.380,00:44:38.009,"And if you lose him again, don't bother calling in. You got that?"
00:44:38.426,00:44:39.969,"-Yes, sir. -Yes, sir."
00:44:41.929,00:44:43.222,A late supper!
00:44:45.850,00:44:47.393,"We've got something for you, Billy."
00:44:49.312,00:44:51.355,An anti-banana disguise.
00:44:55.318,00:44:56.402,It may come in handy.
00:45:21.344,00:45:23.221,Why don't you take the car and go on home?
00:45:23.888,00:45:25.056,"Well, what about you?"
00:45:30.728,00:45:33.105,They hold our foreign shipments here till they clear customs.
00:45:33.898,00:45:36.609,"I'm gonna go check it out. Just take the car and go home, okay?"
00:45:36.692,00:45:40.363,"Damn it, Axel! I'm not gonna bail you out again."
00:45:40.821,00:45:41.822,Go home.
00:46:38.879,00:46:41.757,"How you doing? Can you come here for a second, please?"
00:46:43.801,00:46:46.387,"-Hi, do you have a match? -There's no smoking in here."
00:46:46.470,00:46:48.431,I'm not gonna smoke. I'm gon' smoke when I go outside.
00:46:48.514,00:46:50.349,Thank you very much. Thank you.
00:46:50.641,00:46:52.768,"-Is your supervisor here? -Yeah, he's in the office."
00:46:52.893,00:46:54.103,Can you go get him for me please?
00:46:54.186,00:46:55.104,What's the problem?
00:46:55.187,00:46:56.188,-Are you security here? -Yeah.
00:46:56.439,00:46:59.650,"Then you're the fucking problem. Go get your supervisor, please. Now."
00:47:00.526,00:47:01.444,Now!
00:47:02.278,00:47:03.195,Okay!
00:47:10.077,00:47:11.454,He didn't come back yet.
00:47:14.957,00:47:16.292,What do we do now?
00:47:22.590,00:47:23.507,Okay.
00:47:26.844,00:47:30.056,"-Yes. Who are you? -I'm Inspector Rafferty, United States Customs Service."
00:47:30.181,00:47:31.807,Has all this stuff passed through Customs already?
00:47:32.433,00:47:33.684,"No, this is the bonded area."
00:47:34.018,00:47:35.561,"Well, then tell me something, answer a question for me."
00:47:35.686,00:47:43.194,"How can a black man, dressed like me, just march into your warehouse, walk into the bonded area and start poking around without anyone asking me any questions whatsoever?"
00:47:44.195,00:47:45.404,"Well, I don't know."
00:47:45.529,00:47:47.114,"Well, thank you, that's the answer I was looking for."
00:47:47.198,00:47:48.824,Why don't you guys just give me your ID numbers?
00:47:48.908,00:47:50.493,Because somebody's gonna lose their job behind this.
00:47:50.618,00:47:52.203,"This guy gave me a match, for Christ's sake."
00:47:52.328,00:47:54.288,"Oh, you gave him a match?"
00:47:54.789,00:47:58.167,Listen. Listen to me. I do security checks all over the nation.
00:47:58.292,00:48:03.547,"And with the exception of Cleveland, this place has the worst security in the nation!"
00:48:03.631,00:48:06.384,"Now, I suggest you guys call your wives, because we're gonna be here all night."
00:48:06.467,00:48:11.889,"We're gonna check the background of each and every crate in this section, starting with this one right here."
00:48:12.598,00:48:13.474,Wow.
00:48:14.433,00:48:23.150,"You know, it says here that By the time the average American is 50, he's got five pounds of undigested red meat in his bowels."
00:48:25.111,00:48:26.320,Why are you telling me this?
00:48:27.154,00:48:29.657,What makes you think I have any interest in that at all?
00:48:32.284,00:48:34.078,"Well, you eat a lot of red meat."
00:48:35.579,00:48:39.834,"Now, the inspector needs all the information -on those air waybill numbers. -And all the manifests, too."
00:48:40.084,00:48:43.879,"That's right, and he needs the records of all shipments due -into the same destination. -Right."
00:48:44.296,00:48:46.132,-What's this all about? -Just do it.
00:48:46.549,00:48:48.175,You got some kind of warrant for this?
00:48:49.552,00:48:52.888,"You know, you have a very big mouth, sir. Are you hiding something from me?"
00:48:53.180,00:48:57.268,"Is that what you're doing? I bet you that's your Porsche that's parked outside, isn't it? Isn't that your Porsche? Is it?"
00:48:57.351,00:49:01.105,How would you like for me to have the IRS come down here and crawl up your fucking ass with a microscope?
00:49:01.230,00:49:05.109,"'Cause they'll do it, I've seen them do it, it's not a pretty sight. I want you to know something, pal."
00:49:05.526,00:49:06.861,And I want all y'all to know something.
00:49:06.944,00:49:16.537,"I could have 25 agents down here in 15 minutes to march in here, snatch your bonds from underneath you, and you guys would be out of business, permanently, if I don't get some cooperation. Is that understood?"
00:49:16.871,00:49:17.788,"Don't get upset, inspector."
00:49:17.872,00:49:19.373,"We'll give you everything you need. Right, guys?"
00:49:20.291,00:49:21.208,Everything you need.
00:49:21.292,00:49:23.169,"That's not my Porsche, no, sir. I don't know whose it is."
00:49:23.252,00:49:24.795,"Well, you ain't got nothing to worry about, then."
00:49:25.045,00:49:27.506,I don't know what y'all think I am. Y'all take me for some kind of fool.
00:49:27.631,00:49:28.549,Hurry up! Quicker!
00:49:34.388,00:49:37.141,"You know, I notice you've been drinking a lot of coffee lately."
00:49:40.060,00:49:42.563,"Well, I think that's why you have a hard time relaxing."
00:50:05.794,00:50:07.379,You almost gave me a heart attack.
00:50:07.713,00:50:09.048,What are you guys doing here so late?
00:50:09.256,00:50:10.966,"You're a cocky son of a bitch, aren't you?"
00:50:11.926,00:50:14.803,"Look, man, if you're still mad about the banana thing, I'm sorry, all right?"
00:50:15.137,00:50:17.056,-I just needed a little time to myself. -Yeah.
00:50:17.139,00:50:19.642,I just wish I would've saw the expression on your face when the car conked out.
00:50:21.185,00:50:23.979,"Yeah, very funny. The lieutenant docked us two days' pay."
00:50:24.146,00:50:25.231,Get outta here!
00:50:28.776,00:50:31.028,"-He's not kidding. -No, he's not kidding."
00:50:33.322,00:50:35.950,"By the way, thanks for the sandwich."
00:50:36.492,00:50:38.619,"He meant it as a joke, Billy. Like the bananas."
00:50:40.120,00:50:42.498,I'm a fellow police officer. I know what it's like to be on a stakeout.
00:50:42.581,00:50:44.792,"When I sent that food down to you guys, that was from the heart."
00:50:45.209,00:50:46.126,Bullshit!
00:50:47.336,00:50:49.129,"Why are we always arguing, man?"
00:50:49.296,00:50:51.549,"Like, all three of us are cops. We should be working together."
00:50:52.007,00:50:53.509,We all had a very rough day today.
00:50:54.093,00:50:58.347,"What do you say, we all go get something to drink, and make up and be friends, huh?"
00:50:59.640,00:51:00.558,Forget it.
00:51:01.976,00:51:04.603,"Okay, fuck it. I'm gonna go get something to drink, though, all right?"
00:51:04.728,00:51:06.814,You guys can try to follow me if you wanna do that.
00:51:07.147,00:51:09.650,"But I lost y'all once today, which means I can do this shit again."
00:51:09.942,00:51:12.945,"Why don't we say, you know, we just go get something to drink together? Let's be friends."
00:51:13.946,00:51:15.155,We don't drink on duty.
00:51:15.573,00:51:17.533,Okay. Fine. All right.
00:51:17.616,00:51:20.995,But listen to me. I found the perfect place.
00:51:21.078,00:51:23.205,I saw it on the way over here today. It's perfect for you guys.
00:51:23.289,00:51:25.874,"You can go. It's very conservative, and you guys will love it."
00:51:26.000,00:51:28.419,Don't worry. It's nice. Trust me.
00:51:56.488,00:51:59.658,"Can I have a Scotch and soda? And brothers, what y'all want?"
00:51:59.742,00:52:02.578,"-Like, uh, light beers for the fellas. -Two club sodas."
00:52:04.163,00:52:06.582,"Y'all crack me up, man, with this on duty shit."
00:52:07.833,00:52:11.920,"Billy! Billy, you know, you don't have to be embarrassed if your dick gets hard."
00:52:12.671,00:52:15.966,Your dick is supposed to get hard. See? That's the whole object of this.
00:52:16.300,00:52:18.886,"Taggart's dick is hard, but he don't let you know, 'cause he's the boss."
00:52:19.261,00:52:23.265,"Boss's dick got to stay limp, right? I ain't on duty, so my dick can be hard."
00:52:28.437,00:52:30.230,Check that out. I found that at Maitland's warehouse.
00:52:37.029,00:52:37.946,Excuse me.
00:52:40.866,00:52:41.742,Billy.
00:52:44.370,00:52:46.246,-What do you think? -Coffee grounds.
00:52:46.372,00:52:47.748,-Yeah! -So?
00:52:48.165,00:52:50.292,"You guys don't know nothing about nothing, do you?"
00:52:50.542,00:52:52.961,"You just got your badges and your guns, and you're on the job, right?"
00:52:53.045,00:52:59.468,"Make sure we get the right drinks, 'cause if I drink club soda, Thank you so much. Thank you very much."
00:53:23.701,00:53:25.703,-Think she likes you. -Think so?
00:53:29.164,00:53:32.751,"Taggart, see that guy over there in the black coat?"
00:53:34.253,00:53:35.295,Black jacket?
00:53:37.005,00:53:38.632,"-Yeah. -Well, it's June."
00:53:38.716,00:53:40.884,"Don't you think it's kinda hot for a long, black, leather coat?"
00:53:41.635,00:53:43.137,"-Yeah, a little bit. -Yeah."
00:53:43.721,00:53:45.973,Look at his partner over there. They just came in together.
00:53:49.143,00:53:50.561,Something's getting ready to go down.
00:53:52.146,00:53:54.356,"Why don't you go over there and cover that guy for me, all right?"
00:53:55.649,00:53:57.276,I'm gonna go check out this asshole at the bar.
00:53:58.152,00:53:59.987,Billy will be here is gonna make sure that I behave.
00:54:00.487,00:54:01.947,Will somebody tell me what's going on?
00:54:07.828,00:54:08.996,No bullshit this time.
00:54:13.250,00:54:14.376,"Just sit tight, Billy."
00:54:42.529,00:54:43.405,Philip!
00:54:44.865,00:54:48.494,"Hey, man, what's happening, Phil? I knew that was you!"
00:54:48.660,00:54:52.206,"He told me, the brother, that you said that you don't come here no more, but I said, It's Phil."
00:54:52.289,00:54:53.499,"-It is Philip. -Get out of here, man."
00:54:53.582,00:54:55.334,"I told you it's Philip, you liar!"
00:54:55.459,00:54:57.836,"-Hey, Philip, give me a kiss, baby! -I said get the hell out of here!"
00:55:01.089,00:55:02.299,Everybody freeze!
00:55:04.092,00:55:05.385,Turn around. Turn around!
00:55:08.222,00:55:10.390,"Phil! What's wrong, man?"
00:55:10.516,00:55:12.226,"-What's all the hostility, Phil? -Get back, man!"
00:55:12.434,00:55:14.394,"-Get back, man. -What you doing with all this gun, man?"
00:55:14.520,00:55:16.438,"-Won't you just get back? -You changed, man."
00:55:16.522,00:55:17.689,I'm… I'm telling you to get back!
00:55:17.815,00:55:19.775,"If you don't get back, I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out!"
00:55:22.820,00:55:24.363,Police. Move and I'll kill you.
00:55:26.156,00:55:28.784,Don't move! Turn over!
00:55:30.035,00:55:32.955,"Way to go, Rosewood. You're some kinda cop, you know that?"
00:55:33.330,00:55:35.999,"Sorry for the disturbance, folks. Everything's under control."
00:55:47.594,00:55:48.554,Taggart.
00:55:50.556,00:55:56.895,"Would you mind explaining to me what you and Rosewood were doing in a strip bar, out of our jurisdiction, when you were still on duty?"
00:55:57.312,00:56:00.941,"Sir, before you chastise these officers, I think there's something you should know."
00:56:01.567,00:56:06.905,The only reason they were at a strip bar is because they were tailing me and I went to this place.
00:56:07.197,00:56:09.825,"Now, these two officers were sitting outside, wondering what I was doing."
00:56:10.117,00:56:12.536,"I was in having a good time, I'm into things like that."
00:56:13.036,00:56:22.504,"Anyway, these guys waited outside, and the only reason that they came in was because they saw two suspicious-looking gentlemen with bulges in their jackets going into the place."
00:56:23.338,00:56:25.883,"Well, it turns out that these guys were going to commit a robbery, sir."
00:56:26.258,00:56:30.512,"These men watched them, waited for them to make their move, and then they foiled a crime."
00:56:30.888,00:56:33.891,"I did not know what was going on. I was watching the show, having fun."
00:56:34.016,00:56:41.440,"I'm still freaked out by it. They must have a sixth sense or-- I don't know what you teach these fellows, but they're not just regular cops, okay?"
00:56:41.732,00:56:42.858,They're supercops.
00:56:43.233,00:56:45.819,And the only thing missing on these guys are capes.
00:56:50.282,00:56:51.783,Is this what really happened?
00:56:54.578,00:56:55.495,"No, sir."
00:56:56.705,00:56:59.082,Would someone like to tell me what really happened?
00:57:03.503,00:57:07.049,Foley invited us to this bar. We accepted.
00:57:07.549,00:57:10.218,"-Uh, we ordered club sodas, sir. -Right."
00:57:11.136,00:57:17.601,"And while we were there, Foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment."
00:57:18.560,00:57:23.649,"And before we knew what was going on, he'd already disarmed one of them."
00:57:25.692,00:57:29.237,"Detective Foley deserves all the credit for the arrests, sir."
00:57:30.447,00:57:39.706,"Detective Foley, we appreciate your assistance, but in the future, if you want to practice law enforcement, I would prefer you did it in Detroit."
00:57:41.792,00:57:43.210,"I understand, sir. I'm sorry."
00:57:44.294,00:57:46.421,"But before I go, I just want you two to know something, all right?"
00:57:46.546,00:57:49.508,The supercop story was working.
00:57:50.676,00:57:53.345,"Okay? It was working, and you guys just messed it up."
00:57:54.429,00:57:55.347,Okay?
00:57:55.931,00:57:59.810,"I'm trying to figure you guys out, but I haven't yet. But it's cool."
00:58:00.394,00:58:03.146,"Just fuck up a perfectly good lie, and it's all right."
00:58:09.945,00:58:12.614,You guys are off the case.
00:58:13.281,00:58:16.326,"Foster, McCabe, your turn."
00:58:18.245,00:58:19.204,Don't lose him.
00:58:20.664,00:58:21.957,"Not a chance, sir."
00:58:23.917,00:58:27.462,And you two… in my office.
00:58:46.440,00:58:48.608,"Morning, gentlemen. Some coffee and donuts?"
00:58:49.526,00:58:51.611,-What? -Coffee and donuts.
00:58:57.909,00:58:58.785,There he is.
00:59:16.344,00:59:18.764,"Morning, officers. What y'all, the second team?"
00:59:20.432,00:59:21.516,We're the first team.
00:59:21.725,00:59:24.811,"Yeah, we're not gonna fall for a banana in the tailpipe."
00:59:30.776,00:59:33.278,"Look, man, I ain't falling for no banana in my tailpipe!"
00:59:33.612,00:59:35.280,See? That's more natural for us.
00:59:35.447,00:59:36.907,You've been hanging out with this dude too long.
00:59:41.787,00:59:42.871,That's funny to me. Sorry.
00:59:44.790,00:59:47.209,-So you're gonna try to keep up with me? -No problem.
00:59:48.418,00:59:51.129,"-Isn't this Victor Maitland's house? -Yeah, I think so."
00:59:54.925,00:59:57.594,"Well, I've seen enough. Y'all want something to drink?"
00:59:57.803,01:00:00.722,Beer or something? I got some stuff in the trunk. Excuse me.
01:00:13.944,01:00:17.155,"For a man who claims to be on vacation, you look a lot like you're on a stakeout."
01:00:17.447,01:00:21.785,"Stakeout? No, no. I'm picnicking. This is like a picnic area."
01:00:30.127,01:00:32.129,"Well, guys, I've been shooting the shit long enough."
01:00:32.671,01:00:34.464,Time for me to take in some sights. Excuse me.
01:01:27.809,01:01:29.144,What the hell's he doing?
01:02:21.947,01:02:25.033,-Okay. Good. Nice to meet you then. -All right.
01:02:28.578,01:02:29.788,Can you put this in a good spot?
01:02:30.121,01:02:32.832,All this shit happened last time I parked here. Thank you.
01:03:00.944,01:03:02.279,May I help you?
01:03:04.030,01:03:06.700,Yes. I'm looking for Victor Maitland.
01:03:07.742,01:03:10.287,"Well, you realize that this is a members-only club?"
01:03:10.787,01:03:13.206,"Mm-hmm. But I have to talk to Victor. It's very, very important."
01:03:13.540,01:03:15.125,Are you sure it's Victor Maitland you want?
01:03:15.208,01:03:17.419,"Oh, yes. Victor Maitland, gray-haired gentleman."
01:03:17.585,01:03:20.046,Very dark skin. Capricorn. Victor.
01:03:20.880,01:03:24.050,"Um, well, why don't you give me the message, and I'll take it to him?"
01:03:25.010,01:03:29.889,"Okay, I guess I can do that. Tell Victor that Ramon, the fella he met about a week ago."
01:03:30.098,01:03:38.189,"Tell him that Ramon went to the clinic today, and I found out that I have, um… herpes simplex ten."
01:03:38.481,01:03:44.779,And I think Victor should go check himself out with his physician to make sure everything is fine before things start falling off on the man.
01:03:47.532,01:03:49.200,"Uh, perhaps you'd better tell him that."
01:03:52.287,01:03:54.039,"You know, I think that would be best."
01:03:55.165,01:03:56.041,So do I.
01:04:11.556,01:04:12.515,"Hi, Victor."
01:04:15.977,01:04:16.895,I'm back.
01:04:24.194,01:04:25.779,"Look, guys, don't even try it, okay?"
01:04:27.655,01:04:29.866,"Why don't you get the hell out of here, cuz?"
01:04:48.718,01:04:49.969,"That's very good, Victor."
01:04:50.095,01:04:52.931,"Could you, like teach him to roll over and sit and do all that shit, too?"
01:04:54.474,01:04:56.309,-What do you want? -I wanna talk to you.
01:04:56.851,01:04:58.853,"Last time we met, I didn't get the chance to talk to you."
01:04:59.479,01:05:00.980,I've nothing to say to you.
01:05:01.314,01:05:02.732,"That's cool, I'll do all the talking."
01:05:05.235,01:05:06.945,"This is a very nice place, Vic."
01:05:08.196,01:05:10.657,Hi. I like this. This is nice.
01:05:11.950,01:05:13.660,Glad you like it. I must make you a member.
01:05:17.497,01:05:21.209,"You know, Victor, I know that you're into a lot of crooked shit."
01:05:22.043,01:05:24.379,And I have a pretty good idea that you had Mikey killed.
01:05:25.713,01:05:27.090,And when I find out for sure.
01:05:33.012,01:05:35.348,"Now listen to me, my tough little friend."
01:05:36.099,01:05:43.356,"I don't know from under what stone you crawled, or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me."
01:05:44.107,01:05:50.113,But it seems painfully obvious you haven't the slightest fucking idea who you're dealing with.
01:05:51.489,01:05:59.622,"Now, my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in Detroit before you get squashed."
01:06:00.623,01:06:01.541,Okay?
01:06:01.916,01:06:05.211,"-Please step away from the table, sir. -Gotta go now, Vic."
01:06:14.888,01:06:15.763,"Catch you later, Vic."
01:06:17.557,01:06:18.641,I can't wait.
01:06:32.197,01:06:35.158,Don't I know you guys from someplace? You look so familiar.
01:06:37.702,01:06:41.122,"Detective Foley, this is becoming very irritating."
01:06:41.581,01:06:43.208,Why are you bothering Victor Maitland?
01:06:47.003,01:06:49.839,I had a friend named Michael Tandino that used to work for Victor Maitland.
01:06:50.715,01:06:55.512,"And Maitland had him killed. I can't prove that right now, but when I do, you'll be the first to know."
01:06:58.306,01:07:00.850,"Forget what you can prove, talk to me."
01:07:03.895,01:07:04.938,"Okay, listen."
01:07:05.396,01:07:08.358,"Everybody knows that Victor Maitland is a hotshot art dealer, okay?"
01:07:08.525,01:07:11.402,"But I did some poking around, and art's not the only thing that he deals."
01:07:11.611,01:07:16.824,"I went to his warehouse, and I saw some guys unloading a crate that was filled with German bearer bonds."
01:07:17.242,01:07:22.622,"Now, my friend, Michael Tandino, had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed in Detroit."
01:07:23.122,01:07:27.961,Just because Maitland chooses to invest in the same kind of bonds your friend had doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.
01:07:28.211,01:07:30.338,"The man's not an investor, he's a smuggler."
01:07:30.505,01:07:33.591,"Okay? Be it bonds, or drugs, or whatever."
01:07:33.800,01:07:36.261,The crate that I saw didn't even pass through Customs.
01:07:36.511,01:07:41.057,Maitland is paying someone so his guys can get his shipments out of Customs before they get inspected.
01:07:41.349,01:07:48.481,"When Maitland's guys get their hands on it, they take the drugs or the bonds out of the crates and they send it back before Customs even knows what's going on."
01:07:51.651,01:07:52.860,And you witnessed all this?
01:07:53.778,01:07:55.405,Everything except for the drugs.
01:07:55.738,01:07:57.907,But I found coffee grounds all over the warehouse.
01:07:59.200,01:08:00.118,Coffee grounds?
01:08:00.326,01:08:02.537,You said something about that before. What does that mean?
01:08:02.704,01:08:04.706,Drugs are sometimes packed in coffee grounds.
01:08:04.831,01:08:05.915,The scent throws off the dogs.
01:08:06.666,01:08:08.209,"Very good, lieutenant. Now what do we do?"
01:08:10.920,01:08:25.059,"Look, Detective Foley, I… If you'd found the drugs, that's one thing, but if your only evidence is coffee grounds, we don't have enough to get a search warrant."
01:08:25.435,01:08:29.897,"Come on, guys. I know how we can get around-- We don't get around search warrants in Beverly Hills."
01:08:33.818,01:08:35.194,I want you to start checking this out.
01:08:36.070,01:08:39.157,"Start with the LAPD, the FBI and the Customs Service."
01:08:39.407,01:08:40.533,"Hey, wait a minute, Taggart."
01:08:40.908,01:08:43.369,"Look, lieutenant, Maitland is much smarter than that."
01:08:43.494,01:08:47.165,"We go and start snooping around this place, he's gonna close down and get his shipments from someplace else."
01:08:47.290,01:08:48.374,It'll be a big waste of time.
01:08:48.541,01:08:49.459,"Oh, really?"
01:08:49.917,01:08:52.503,Is that what your extensive experience leads you to believe?
01:08:52.837,01:08:54.589,"-Look, I haven't been on the force-- -Sir."
01:08:59.719,01:09:01.721,"-Is this the man? -Yes, sir."
01:09:03.556,01:09:06.142,Is this the gentleman that crashed through Victor Maitland's window?
01:09:07.602,01:09:10.938,Who disabled an unmarked unit with a banana?
01:09:11.564,01:09:12.440,"Yes, sir."
01:09:12.940,01:09:21.824,Who lured Taggart and Rosemont into a gross dereliction of duty at a striptease establishment?
01:09:22.450,01:09:24.202,"Uh, it's Rosewood, sir."
01:09:25.411,01:09:26.329,"Yes, sir."
01:09:27.497,01:09:32.085,Is this the gentleman who ruined the buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?
01:09:35.129,01:09:39.550,I just bet you are the pride of your department in Detroit.
01:09:44.097,01:09:46.599,"Lieutenant, I'd like to see you in your office."
01:09:47.850,01:09:48.768,"Yes, sir."
01:09:53.523,01:09:58.403,Is this the man who wrecked the buffet at the Harrow Club this morning?
01:10:00.446,01:10:01.906,What? Can the guy hear me through the wall?
01:10:02.782,01:10:03.950,"-Yeah, he can. -Yes, he can."
01:10:20.883,01:10:29.851,"Rosewood, take Detective Foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits."
01:10:31.602,01:10:33.438,"When you get there, you can give him his gun back."
01:10:35.148,01:10:38.276,The two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
01:10:39.736,01:10:47.452,"But the chief says if you return to the City of Beverly Hills, the charges will be reinstated, and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law."
01:10:48.494,01:10:49.871,"Sir, may I say something?"
01:10:51.205,01:10:54.751,"Well, he seems to have enough to… to follow up-- You want to tell that to the chief?"
01:10:56.878,01:10:58.963,"-No, sir. -Then I suggest you get moving."
01:11:21.819,01:11:25.364,"Uh, right. Let me check on that tomorrow and get right back to you."
01:11:25.948,01:11:26.824,Thank you.
01:11:27.784,01:11:29.494,"-Hi. -Victor, hi."
01:11:30.495,01:11:34.624,"-Sit down. Hope I'm not interrupting you. -Of course not, don't be silly."
01:11:35.500,01:11:40.713,"Jenny, there's a gentleman in town from Detroit who says he's a friend of Michael Tandino."
01:11:41.839,01:11:47.553,"He came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of, um, of rather odd questions. Excuse me, now."
01:11:48.429,01:11:50.056,I believe his name is Foley.
01:11:51.224,01:11:56.020,"Since you were such a good friend of Michael, I was wondering if you were perhaps familiar with the fellow."
01:11:57.063,01:11:59.649,"Well, we grew up in the same neighborhood."
01:11:59.899,01:12:01.567,Really? Have you seen him lately?
01:12:04.153,01:12:05.947,"He, uh, he came in yesterday."
01:12:06.781,01:12:08.074,What? He came by here?
01:12:09.408,01:12:10.284,Huh.
01:12:12.203,01:12:13.079,And?
01:12:14.956,01:12:18.042,"He told me that, uh, Mikey had been killed."
01:12:19.544,01:12:21.921,"Yes. Yes, I know."
01:12:24.423,01:12:26.843,"-And then? -Well, then. That's it."
01:12:27.593,01:12:31.389,"He left and, uh… I haven't seen him since."
01:12:32.348,01:12:36.519,"Hmm. Jenny darling, you wouldn't, by any chance, know where Foley is staying, would you?"
01:12:36.853,01:12:39.856,I have some information which just might be helpful for him.
01:12:43.734,01:12:45.194,"No, I… I have no idea."
01:12:50.908,01:12:51.826,Yes.
01:12:53.619,01:12:54.495,Yes.
01:12:55.371,01:12:57.248,I hope I didn't disturb you too much.
01:12:57.373,01:13:00.710,"-Uh, no. No problem. -We'll have dinner soon, yes?"
01:13:01.752,01:13:03.671,"-Well, that'd be lovely. -Take care."
01:13:16.267,01:13:18.227,"Hey Billy, look, I read the manifests, all right?"
01:13:18.311,01:13:20.021,They're expecting another shipment in today.
01:13:22.064,01:13:23.149,-The Bogomil-- -Never mind Bogomil!
01:13:23.274,01:13:27.153,"This is a chance for me and you to blow this case wide open, the two of us. What do you say? Come on!"
01:13:27.278,01:13:30.406,"Look, Axel, I wish I could, but I can't."
01:13:30.573,01:13:31.490,Why?
01:13:32.450,01:13:34.118,Because Bogomil would kill me!
01:13:39.874,01:13:42.126,"I'm not gonna drive you to the art gallery, Axel."
01:13:43.044,01:13:44.629,"Billy, it'll just take a couple of minutes!"
01:13:44.712,01:13:49.050,"My friend Jenny will let us in Maitland's warehouse, we can be there when the shipment comes in and nail 'em."
01:13:49.216,01:13:51.177,How can you be sure if it'll be drugs or something?
01:13:51.260,01:13:52.470,"I got a hunch, okay?"
01:13:52.678,01:13:56.057,That's a technique by which many crimes outside of Beverly Hills get solved.
01:13:57.892,01:14:00.061,Why didn't you tell Bogomil about this shipment?
01:14:00.561,01:14:05.399,"Bogomil does everything by the book. You know, I'm starting to think that everybody in this goddamn town is a robot."
01:14:05.858,01:14:07.360,This thing is very personal to me.
01:14:14.742,01:14:16.160,"Now I'm going to screw that up, too."
01:14:19.664,01:14:24.168,"Billy, I love you. I just fell in love with you."
01:14:27.505,01:14:29.548,"Jenny, how you doing?"
01:14:29.632,01:14:31.926,This is my good buddy Billy Rosewood. This is Jenny Summers.
01:14:32.051,01:14:34.053,-Hi. -Billy's a Beverly Hills cop.
01:14:34.345,01:14:37.473,"-How do you do? -That's Serge. Yo, Serge!"
01:14:38.599,01:14:40.434,Can you get my friend an espresso?
01:14:40.810,01:14:42.561,You want it with a lemon twist?
01:14:43.270,01:14:46.732,"Uh… yeah, sure, if it's no bother."
01:14:50.319,01:14:53.489,"Axel, Victor Maitland was here asking questions about you today."
01:14:53.823,01:14:55.825,"I'm telling you, he was acting real weird."
01:14:56.158,01:14:59.370,"Yeah, well, look the reason I came down here is because I want to get back inside the warehouse."
01:14:59.912,01:15:00.913,How about I go with you?
01:15:01.622,01:15:04.709,"Jenny, come on now, you work here with Serge in an art gallery."
01:15:04.834,01:15:05.751,You're not a cop.
01:15:05.835,01:15:09.755,"Look, Axel, if this has anything to do with Mikey getting killed, then I wanna go check it out for myself."
01:15:10.089,01:15:12.216,"I don't have time to stand here and argue with you, Jenny."
01:15:12.800,01:15:16.470,"Wait a second. Let me get my keys, and we'll argue on the way."
01:15:20.891,01:15:23.060,"Okay, Billy, your job is to just sit here and observe things, all right?"
01:15:23.227,01:15:24.895,Don't make a move until I come out and get you.
01:15:25.021,01:15:26.272,I don't see why I can't come in.
01:15:26.522,01:15:28.524,You can't go in 'cause you're a cop in this town.
01:15:28.899,01:15:31.402,"You go in there without probable cause, they'll call it an illegal search."
01:15:31.485,01:15:33.612,You know that. Didn't they teach you that in cop school?
01:15:33.821,01:15:34.780,"Just sit tight, okay?"
01:15:34.947,01:15:36.615,"If I find some evidence, I'll come out and get you."
01:15:36.699,01:15:44.081,"But you can't-- But nothing! Just be cool, all right? If anything jumps off, I'll come and I'll get you, all right? I promise. Okay? Thank you."
01:15:45.374,01:15:48.961,Is there any chance you're gonna give me that key and let me go in there by myself right now?
01:15:49.170,01:15:50.129,No chance.
01:15:52.339,01:15:54.425,Fuck. Come on.
01:16:40.513,01:16:43.849,-Looks like they've been here already. -What exactly are you looking for?
01:16:45.434,01:16:47.812,This is a crate from overseas that hasn't passed through Customs yet.
01:17:10.918,01:17:11.794,Coffee?
01:17:20.386,01:17:22.680,But this ain't sugar. Go get Rosewood.
01:17:23.430,01:17:24.515,Welcome to the party.
01:17:50.374,01:17:51.667,It seems we have guests.
01:18:13.355,01:18:16.942,How nice. I do like surprises.
01:18:29.371,01:18:30.247,Jeanette.
01:18:34.752,01:18:39.215,I just can't tell you how disappointed I am to find you here.
01:18:40.090,01:18:41.425,"-Victor, listen, I-- -Shut up!"
01:18:43.385,01:18:45.012,I don't want to hear it.
01:19:03.447,01:19:06.533,Take her to the car and wait for me. Okay?
01:19:07.117,01:19:08.202,What are you gonna do with him?
01:19:09.078,01:19:13.332,I think you should be more worried about what we're going to do with you.
01:19:13.624,01:19:16.252,"Jenny, don't worry about me. We've got cocaine and coffee here."
01:19:16.335,01:19:17.962,We're gonna get wired and have a big party.
01:19:18.212,01:19:20.673,"Thanks for having me over, Vic. This is very nice."
01:19:22.383,01:19:23.509,Did you say something?
01:19:38.857,01:19:44.947,If something happens to her… Hmm. I'm all ears.
01:19:46.907,01:19:47.825,I'll kill you.
01:19:49.827,01:19:50.703,Really?
01:19:52.037,01:19:53.455,That would be a neat trick.
01:20:05.634,01:20:06.969,"Well, cuz."
01:20:08.220,01:20:09.722,Are you still pissed at me?
01:20:11.598,01:20:14.810,"Oh, no. No."
01:20:16.312,01:20:18.147,But I should have taken care of you in Detroit.
01:20:24.194,01:20:26.071,When I popped your little buddy.
01:20:33.454,01:20:34.747,"Goodbye, Mr. Foley."
01:20:37.624,01:20:40.627,-Have a nice day. -I'll try.
01:21:10.491,01:21:11.784,"Oh, boy."
01:21:24.713,01:21:27.674,"How's that little bump on the head doing I gave you in Detroit, huh?"
01:21:28.467,01:21:30.094,"Healed up nice, I hope."
01:22:11.427,01:22:12.344,"Thanks, man."
01:22:27.651,01:22:32.322,Tell Taggart to check out the warehouse at that address and act on whatever he finds. I'll explain it to him later.
01:22:32.573,01:22:35.534,"DD-6, Sergeant Taggart is here now, he wants to talk to you."
01:22:35.617,01:22:36.535,Shit!
01:22:37.202,01:22:39.580,"Billy, what the hell is going on?"
01:22:39.955,01:22:43.709,"-I'm sorry, Sarge, I can't talk now. -What do you mean you can't talk now?"
01:22:44.042,01:22:47.087,"Just check out the warehouse, and please don't say anything to Bogomil."
01:22:48.714,01:22:50.340,"Sorry, sir, he's not transmitting anymore."
01:22:50.549,01:22:51.925,"-Ah, shit. -What's the matter?"
01:22:52.092,01:22:55.012,"It's Billy. He's doing something dumb again, but I don't know what."
01:22:55.679,01:22:58.056,"-Was he calling from the hotel? -No, sir."
01:22:59.641,01:23:02.853,"Right now, his car's heading north on Palm Canyon Road."
01:23:05.481,01:23:06.398,Yeah.
01:23:06.982,01:23:09.151,Foley was up there looking over at Maitland's house.
01:23:09.610,01:23:11.069,Do you have the address of that warehouse?
01:23:11.278,01:23:12.946,"-Yes, sir. -Here."
01:23:14.072,01:23:18.744,"You two check that place out, then find me and let me know what the hell is going on over there."
01:23:18.911,01:23:20.746,And don't talk to anybody but me.
01:23:41.808,01:23:43.769,"Hold it right there, Foley. You're under arrest."
01:23:43.936,01:23:45.312,"Billy, what the hell are you doing here?"
01:23:45.479,01:23:47.147,I stole my gun and forced him to bring me here.
01:23:47.272,01:23:50.442,"No, he didn't, Sarge. Look, everything he said about Maitland is right."
01:23:50.609,01:23:52.903,Now he's kidnapped a woman and he's got her in this house.
01:23:54.780,01:23:56.031,"Well, let's go in there and get her."
01:23:56.156,01:23:57.824,What the fuck do you think I'm trying to do here?
01:23:57.991,01:23:59.368,You're not doing anything! We'll handle this!
01:23:59.910,01:24:01.370,We'll have a search warrant here in 20 minutes.
01:24:01.453,01:24:02.454,She'll be dead in 20 minutes.
01:24:02.621,01:24:04.248,Stop working on that lock! You're coming with us.
01:24:04.540,01:24:06.458,"Look, man, I'm gonna open up this door and I'm going inside."
01:24:06.542,01:24:07.918,"You want to stop me, shoot me."
01:24:12.214,01:24:14.508,"Really, Sarge, you can do what you want, but I'm going in with Axel."
01:24:14.716,01:24:17.010,"Goddamn it, Billy, this is really serious trouble!"
01:24:17.344,01:24:19.012,"If you're lucky, you'll just get fired."
01:24:29.314,01:24:30.649,Billy!
01:24:31.108,01:24:33.110,"I'm sorry, Sarge. I've got to."
01:24:37.781,01:24:40.075,Shit. Wait a minute.
01:24:57.843,01:24:58.719,Punch it up.
01:25:03.515,01:25:07.185,Who the hell is that? Better get Maitland up here.
01:25:24.578,01:25:27.205,"Where is everybody? Owensby, is Rosewood back yet?"
01:25:27.456,01:25:29.249,"-No, sir. -Have you seen Taggart?"
01:25:29.333,01:25:31.084,He took off about ten minutes ago.
01:25:41.553,01:25:43.096,Foley's on the grounds.
01:25:43.680,01:25:46.975,How the hell should I know? Get some people out there right away.
01:25:50.187,01:25:52.147,Don't take your eyes off that screen.
01:26:23.804,01:26:26.014,I want you to try to locate Taggart and Rosewood.
01:26:37.317,01:26:38.235,Come on.
01:27:02.718,01:27:05.512,"-They must be away from the car, sir. -I can see that. Keep trying."
01:27:07.431,01:27:09.433,"-DD-13, come in please. -What's their 20?"
01:27:14.855,01:27:17.816,-609 Palm Canyon Road. -Who lives at that address?
01:27:22.070,01:27:23.572,"A Victor Maitland, sir."
01:28:11.328,01:28:12.287,You all right?
01:28:16.666,01:28:18.251,What the fuck am I doing here?
01:28:25.258,01:28:26.176,Drop it!
01:28:35.769,01:28:37.354,"-Good shot, Billy. -Let's go."
01:28:48.907,01:28:51.284,"-Jesus Christ! -Yeah, these guys are serious."
01:28:51.743,01:28:53.078,I hate machine guns.
01:29:02.963,01:29:03.839,Cover me.
01:29:17.978,01:29:19.479,You guys go around front. I'm gonna check the back.
01:29:22.816,01:29:25.193,"Sir, we have a report of shots fired at that same location."
01:29:25.402,01:29:27.571,609 Palm Canyon Road.
01:29:28.321,01:29:30.824,"Put it down as a 998, officers need assistance."
01:29:31.408,01:29:33.159,-Undercovers on scene. -Sir?
01:29:33.410,01:29:36.079,Just do it. I want all north end units to roll.
01:29:36.204,01:29:37.831,South end units stay in their area.
01:29:38.707,01:29:40.125,-Damn! Let's go. -All northern units.
01:29:40.292,01:29:42.043,Undercover officers at location.
01:29:51.094,01:29:53.013,Police! You're all under arrest!
01:29:59.603,01:30:02.188,"You do that again, I'll shoot you myself."
01:31:14.427,01:31:15.845,You know what I keep thinking about?
01:31:17.722,01:31:19.265,Know the end of Butch Cassidy?
01:31:22.811,01:31:25.647,Redford and Newman are almost out of ammunition.
01:31:28.066,01:31:31.403,And the whole Bolivian Army is out in front of this little hut.
01:31:34.114,01:31:38.451,Billy… I'm gonna make you pay for this.
01:32:58.782,01:33:00.658,-You gonna hang around here? -Fuck no!
01:33:48.164,01:33:49.249,Axel!
01:33:53.920,01:33:56.214,"Be careful, old boy, it might hit me."
01:34:05.098,01:34:05.974,Freeze!
01:34:24.534,01:34:27.203,Police! You're all under arrest!
01:34:27.537,01:34:33.168,Lay down your weapons in front of you and take two steps back with your hands up!
01:34:38.506,01:34:39.465,Very good.
01:34:40.508,01:34:41.467,Great.
01:35:00.778,01:35:01.988,What the hell's going on here?
01:35:03.072,01:35:04.240,"Oh, shit."
01:35:04.616,01:35:06.576,"-What's this man doing here? -Bleeding, sir."
01:35:07.035,01:35:09.662,"Rosewood, how come he isn't wearing cuffs?"
01:35:10.330,01:35:14.626,"Um, well, he isn't actually in custody, sir."
01:35:14.709,01:35:17.378,"Well, place him in custody, or would you like me to do it?"
01:35:17.629,01:35:19.172,"Wouldn't you like to hear my report first, sir?"
01:35:22.300,01:35:24.928,You have a report that explains all this?
01:35:25.762,01:35:26.721,"Yes, sir."
01:35:28.514,01:35:31.351,"Well, I will be very glad to hear it."
01:35:34.562,01:35:43.613,"Well, sir, Miss Jeanette Summers, the manager of Mr. Maitland's art gallery, accidentally discovered large quantities of a substance she suspected was cocaine in the art gallery's warehouse."
01:35:44.489,01:35:48.743,She immediately communicated her discovery to Detective Axel Foley of the Detroit Police Force.
01:35:50.703,01:35:57.460,"Detective Foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint Beverly Hills-Detroit investigation of narcotics trafficking."
01:35:58.253,01:36:06.344,"Detectives Foley and Rosewood, responding to Miss Summers' report, proceeded to the warehouse, where Rosewood did in fact discover approximately 80 kilos of cocaine."
01:36:07.595,01:36:15.019,"Rosewood immediately called for backup, and I dispatched our officers to this location Sergeant Taggart here was the first to arrive at the scene."
01:36:15.645,01:36:26.239,"Uh, and having probable cause to believe a felony was in progress, Sergeant Taggart joined Rosewood with Detective Foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds."
01:36:26.781,01:36:31.661,"And in the course of defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including Mr. Maitland."
01:36:36.374,01:36:38.960,You expect me to believe that report?
01:36:40.503,01:36:42.213,"That's the report I'm filing, sir."
01:36:45.758,01:36:49.804,"Sergeant Taggart, why don't you tell me what happened?"
01:37:03.651,01:37:05.695,"Happened just like the lieutenant said, Chief."
01:37:25.590,01:37:26.549,"Thank you, sir."
01:37:27.467,01:37:30.094,That report better be on my desk in the morning.
01:37:30.845,01:37:32.305,"Yes, sir. First thing."
01:37:40.938,01:37:43.024,You were lying your ass off.
01:37:46.986,01:37:49.113,Why don't you go to the hospital and get your shoulder looked at.
01:37:51.240,01:37:52.408,"Excuse me, sir."
01:37:57.914,01:38:00.666,"I was wondering if you could, like do me a favor, sir."
01:38:04.504,01:38:05.380,I understand.
01:38:06.005,01:38:12.387,"I just… I was hoping you could, like call on my Inspector Todd, my boss back home and straighten things out for me, but that's all right."
01:38:12.595,01:38:14.555,"I guess I'm just out of a job. That's cool, though."
01:38:15.014,01:38:16.974,I think I'm gonna stay in Beverly Hills. I like it out here.
01:38:17.058,01:38:18.017,You know what I'm gonna do?
01:38:18.101,01:38:20.144,I'm gonna start my own private investigation company. How's that sound?
01:38:21.145,01:38:23.773,I will talk to Inspector Todd first thing tomorrow.
01:38:23.940,01:38:25.608,"-Will you, really? -Yes, you bet."
01:38:25.817,01:38:27.485,"-Thank you so much, sir. -You're welcome."
01:38:35.201,01:38:38.037,How you doing? I'm Axel Foley checking out of suite 1035.
01:38:38.579,01:38:40.581,"One moment, sir. I'll get your bill."
01:38:44.001,01:38:49.006,"Hey! Guys, y'all didn't have to come down and see me off, but I'm very moved by the gesture. Thank you."
01:38:49.465,01:38:52.468,Bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
01:38:54.554,01:38:56.013,"You know doesn't even matter to me, Billy."
01:38:56.097,01:38:57.932,"You know, what matters is that you came down here."
01:38:58.141,01:39:00.726,I'm all choked up on the inside. I've got a lump in my throat.
01:39:01.686,01:39:03.604,"You look a little misty yourself, there, Taggart."
01:39:06.399,01:39:10.403,"Excuse me, the Beverly Hills Police Department is picking that up."
01:39:10.486,01:39:14.115,"Oh, get outta here. Guys, that's the last straw."
01:39:14.365,01:39:16.284,That was the last straw. You guys are too nice.
01:39:16.451,01:39:19.328,"Sir, do you sell those Beverly Palm robes down here?"
01:39:19.495,01:39:21.330,"Yes, we do, sir. They're 95 dollars apiece."
01:39:21.497,01:39:23.207,"Well, money is no object. Put them on my tab."
01:39:23.624,01:39:25.001,"I have to have two of them, though."
01:39:27.211,01:39:31.048,"Billy, you saved my life, okay?"
01:39:31.424,01:39:37.472,"I don't think I'll ever be able to repay you, but as a token of my appreciation, I want you to have this fine Beverly Palm robe."
01:39:37.763,01:39:42.018,"Each time you get out the shower, dripping wet, for the rest of your life, I want you to think about our friendship."
01:39:42.226,01:39:45.021,"I want you to think about Axel Foley. I love you, Billy."
01:39:52.153,01:39:55.990,"Here, let me take this. You should rest that arm."
01:39:56.824,01:39:58.326,"Billy, take care of the tab, would you?"
01:40:01.913,01:40:02.997,This is for you.
01:40:03.873,01:40:06.792,"No, that's all right. You keep it as a souvenir."
01:40:08.669,01:40:10.755,I already have three of them in my bag.
01:40:15.259,01:40:16.469,"-There you go. -Thank you, sir."
01:40:16.636,01:40:18.387,-Take it easy. -Not gonna say goodbye?
01:40:19.805,01:40:22.225,"Why, ain't you guys gonna tail me to the city limits anyway?"
01:40:23.059,01:40:25.269,"-Yes, we are. -I figured you would."
01:40:26.103,01:40:28.439,"I was thinking about stopping off and getting something to drink, though."
01:40:28.981,01:40:32.193,"-Yeah, we sorta figured you would. -That mean you guys are gonna join me?"
01:40:33.152,01:40:35.905,"Uh, I don't think so, Axel. We're still on duty."
01:40:37.198,01:40:40.117,"Well, I don't think one beer's going to kill us, Billy."
01:40:43.996,01:40:45.623,One drink's not gonna kill us!
01:40:47.625,01:40:51.712,"But guys, if you fall too far behind, don't be afraid to honk, okay?"
01:40:52.296,01:40:53.506,"Where we going, anyway?"
01:40:53.714,01:40:56.050,"Don't worry about it, just follow my lead."
01:40:56.300,01:40:59.512,I know the perfect place. You guys'll love it. Trust me.
