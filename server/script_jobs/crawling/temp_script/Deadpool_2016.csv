00:03:01.083,00:03:03.541,Kinda lonesome back here.
00:03:06.375,00:03:10.875,"Okay, um, just, I have to keep my hands on the wheel."
00:03:12.625,00:03:14.416,Excuse me. Whoo!
00:03:16.708,00:03:18.708,Pool. Dead.
00:03:20.125,00:03:21.375,"Hmm, nice."
00:03:22.500,00:03:23.541,"DOPINDER: Smells good, no?"
00:03:23.666,00:03:25.583,Not the Daffodil Daydream.
00:03:25.708,00:03:27.583,"Ah, yes. Gita."
00:03:27.708,00:03:29.125,Hmm.
00:03:29.625,00:03:31.916,She would have made me a very agreeable wife.
00:03:32.041,00:03:33.208,"But, um..."
00:03:34.083,00:03:37.416,Gita's heart has been stolen by my cousin Bandhu.
00:03:37.791,00:03:41.375,He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.
00:03:42.708,00:03:46.458,"Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today."
00:03:46.583,00:03:48.125,"Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?"
00:03:48.250,00:03:53.041,"No, my slender brown friend."
00:03:53.333,00:03:56.041,"When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream."
00:03:57.333,00:03:59.083,So you gotta hold onto love...
00:03:59.458,00:04:00.708,...tight!
00:04:00.833,00:04:02.125,And never let go.
00:04:02.250,00:04:03.708,Don't make the same mistakes I did.
00:04:03.833,00:04:05.000,Got it?
00:04:05.125,00:04:08.666,Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.
00:04:09.250,00:04:11.541,Miss Mama June taste like?
00:04:11.666,00:04:14.541,Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
00:04:14.666,00:04:17.416,"I can go all day, Dopinder."
00:04:17.541,00:04:19.291,"Hmm, it's bad."
00:04:19.666,00:04:22.333,"Uh, why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?"
00:04:22.458,00:04:24.458,"Oh, that's because it's Christmas Day, Dopinder."
00:04:24.583,00:04:27.000,And I'm after someone on my naughty list.
00:04:27.125,00:04:28.625,"I've been waiting one year, three weeks..."
00:04:28.750,00:04:30.583,"six days and, oh..."
00:04:30.708,00:04:33.125,14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
00:04:34.750,00:04:37.000,"And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?"
00:04:37.125,00:04:38.458,This shit...
00:04:39.708,00:04:40.708,Boo!
00:05:01.541,00:05:02.666,They won't disappoint.
00:05:03.333,00:05:05.041,They'd better not.
00:05:05.166,00:05:07.458,And what about next month's shipment?
00:05:07.625,00:05:09.166,There won't be one.
00:05:09.291,00:05:10.916,You're not the only one with a war to win.
00:05:12.166,00:05:13.583,That won't do.
00:05:16.583,00:05:20.458,"See, we've had this small disruption to our supply chain..."
00:05:24.291,00:05:26.500,We'd appreciate your patience.
00:05:30.541,00:05:33.000,We'll deliver in full the following month.
00:05:36.500,00:05:37.583,Pleasure doing business with you.
00:05:41.458,00:05:43.208,Fucking mutant.
00:05:53.208,00:05:54.708,"Oh, shit!"
00:05:54.833,00:05:56.333,I forgot my ammo bag.
00:05:56.625,00:05:57.708,Shall we turn back?
00:05:57.833,00:05:58.875,"No, no time."
00:05:59.291,00:06:00.791,Fuck it. I got this.
00:06:00.916,00:06:04.166,"9, 10, 11, 12 bullets, or bust."
00:06:04.291,00:06:05.333,Right here!
00:06:07.291,00:06:09.750,"That's, uh, $27.50."
00:06:09.916,00:06:11.541,I... I never carry a wallet when I'm working.
00:06:11.666,00:06:13.083,Ruins the lines of my suit.
00:06:13.500,00:06:14.541,Oh.
00:06:13.500,00:06:15.958,"But, uh, how about a crisp high five?"
00:06:16.083,00:06:17.125,Okay.
00:06:17.250,00:06:18.500,Merry Christmas.
00:06:19.833,00:06:22.833,"And a convivial Tuesday in April to you too, Pool!"
00:06:22.958,00:06:38.583,"I wanna shoop, baby shoop ba-doop ba-doop, ba-doop stacked 'specially in the back mother for a butt like that with that shake-shake boobie?"
00:06:38.708,00:06:43.500,you would be an uzi Wha... Oh!
00:06:44.250,00:06:47.333,"Oh, hello. I know, right?"
00:06:47.541,00:06:51.166,Whose balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie?
00:06:51.291,00:06:55.000,"I can't tell you, but it does rhyme with Polverine."
00:06:55.125,00:07:00.541,"And let me tell you, he's got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under."
00:07:00.750,00:07:04.791,"Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix and, oh..."
00:07:04.916,00:07:07.541,Bad guys to kill.
00:07:13.000,00:07:14.250,Maximum effort.
00:07:24.208,00:07:25.208,WADE: Cock shot.
00:07:32.958,00:07:35.041,Rich Corinthian leather.
00:07:37.000,00:07:38.833,WADE: I'm looking for Francis!
00:07:39.375,00:07:41.000,Have you seen this man?
00:07:41.125,00:07:43.125,Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
00:07:49.333,00:07:50.541,WADE: Ow. Ow!
00:07:50.958,00:07:51.958,"Yanky, yanky!"
00:08:24.625,00:08:26.875,"WADE: I've never said this, but don't swallow."
00:08:48.291,00:08:49.791,Shit.
00:08:50.416,00:08:52.416,Did I leave the stove on?
00:09:09.833,00:09:11.208,"REPORTER: Now, breaking news."
00:09:11.583,00:09:15.208,A multi-car collision turned shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning.
00:09:15.541,00:09:17.541,Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
00:09:17.833,00:09:20.291,Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
00:09:20.416,00:09:23.416,"The assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing..."
00:09:23.541,00:09:25.041,a red suit.
00:09:25.708,00:09:26.875,Deadpool.
00:09:27.000,00:09:29.708,Negasonic!
00:09:30.583,00:09:32.958,"NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD: Colossus, wait up."
00:09:33.125,00:09:36.375,I've given Deadpool every chance to join us...
00:09:36.541,00:09:38.625,but he'd rather act like a child.
00:09:38.750,00:09:41.083,A heavily-armed child.
00:09:41.208,00:09:44.958,When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-Man?
00:09:45.083,00:09:46.958,Which benefits?
00:09:47.250,00:09:49.000,The house that blows up every few years?
00:09:49.083,00:09:50.083,Please.
00:09:50.208,00:09:52.583,House blowing up builds character.
00:09:53.083,00:09:54.875,"You ate breakfast, yes?"
00:09:55.000,00:09:57.208,Breakfast is most important meal of day.
00:09:58.166,00:10:02.333,"Here, protein bar."
00:10:02.500,00:10:04.875,Deadpool may try to break yours.
00:10:13.583,00:10:14.791,MAN: Get out of the way!
00:10:32.208,00:10:33.625,WADE: Hey! Whoo!
00:10:44.833,00:10:46.083,WADE: Wait!
00:10:46.500,00:10:48.541,"You may be wondering, Why the red suit?"
00:10:48.666,00:10:50.625,"Well, that's so bad guys can't see me bleed."
00:10:51.750,00:10:52.958,This guy's got the right idea.
00:10:53.291,00:10:54.625,He wore the brown pants.
00:10:56.583,00:10:58.666,Fine!
00:10:58.791,00:11:00.375,so you're gonna have to share!
00:11:00.500,00:11:02.291,Let's count them down.
00:11:21.583,00:11:22.708,Shit.
00:11:25.708,00:11:27.458,Motherfucker!
00:11:28.791,00:11:29.916,10! Shit!
00:11:30.583,00:11:31.583,Nine. Fuck.
00:11:32.000,00:11:33.041,Eight.
00:11:33.166,00:11:34.125,Shit-fuck!
00:11:37.916,00:11:39.125,Bad Deadpool.
00:11:40.583,00:11:42.708,Seven.
00:11:55.625,00:11:56.625,Oh!
00:12:05.000,00:12:07.500,Someone's not counting. Six.
00:12:27.250,00:12:28.666,Oh!
00:12:37.625,00:12:38.750,Gotcha.
00:12:40.416,00:12:41.708,Right up main street.
00:12:45.750,00:12:46.708,"Three, two!"
00:12:46.833,00:12:48.708,Stupid! Worth it.
00:13:12.833,00:13:14.000,Ah!
00:13:15.208,00:13:17.166,I'm touching myself tonight.
00:13:17.958,00:13:19.083,Francis!
00:13:19.458,00:13:20.708,Francis...
00:13:22.666,00:13:24.833,What the shit-biscuit!
00:13:24.958,00:13:26.666,"Where you at, Francis?"
00:13:35.708,00:13:36.750,You're not Francis.
00:13:44.791,00:13:47.208,Really?
00:13:57.583,00:14:00.791,"WADE: You're probably thinking, My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie..."
00:14:00.916,00:14:04.750,but that guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kabab!
00:14:04.916,00:14:09.291,"Well, I may be super, but I'm no hero."
00:14:09.625,00:14:11.708,"And yeah, technically, this is a murder."
00:14:11.833,00:14:14.041,But some of the best love stories start with a murder.
00:14:14.166,00:14:17.208,"And that's exactly what this is, a love story."
00:14:17.333,00:14:18.666,And to tell it right...
00:14:18.791,00:14:23.583,I gotta take you back to long before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.
00:14:24.583,00:14:27.125,"MERCHANT: Look, would it help if I slow it down for you?"
00:14:27.250,00:14:29.583,I didn't order the pizza.
00:14:29.708,00:14:33.500,Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive?
00:14:33.625,00:14:36.583,"Yeah, the Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!"
00:14:37.000,00:14:38.125,Then who placed the call?
00:14:38.750,00:14:40.041,WADE: I did!
00:14:42.333,00:14:43.708,Pineapple and olive?
00:14:44.250,00:14:47.041,Sweet and salty.
00:14:47.208,00:14:48.291,The fuck are you?
00:14:48.416,00:14:50.291,The fuck you doing in my crib...
00:14:50.416,00:14:51.500,Is it burnt crust?
00:14:51.625,00:14:53.416,"I... God, I hope not. Um..."
00:14:53.541,00:14:55.333,"Whoa... Man, look, if this is about that poker game."
00:14:55.458,00:14:57.750,"I told Howie, I told him that..."
00:14:57.875,00:15:01.750,"Okay, uh, look, just take whatever you want."
00:15:01.875,00:15:02.958,Thanks.
00:15:03.916,00:15:06.500,"Sir, before you do anything to him, do you mind if I get a big tip?"
00:15:06.958,00:15:09.750,"Uh, Jeremy, is it?"
00:15:09.875,00:15:11.333,Umm-hmm.
00:15:12.500,00:15:15.416,"That is a no go on the tiperoo, Jer."
00:15:15.541,00:15:17.000,I'm not here for him.
00:15:17.375,00:15:18.916,I'm here for you.
00:15:20.500,00:15:22.291,"Okay, wow, dodged a big-time bullet on that one."
00:15:22.416,00:15:24.375,Not out of the woods yet.
00:15:25.000,00:15:27.291,You need to seriously ease up on the bedazzling.
00:15:27.416,00:15:29.291,"They're jeans, not a chandelier."
00:15:29.416,00:15:31.583,P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
00:15:31.708,00:15:33.458,"Okay, just look, man, can I have my Sam's card..."
00:15:33.583,00:15:35.875,I will shoot your fucking cat!
00:15:36.666,00:15:39.125,I don't really know what that means.
00:15:39.500,00:15:41.250,Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
00:15:45.375,00:15:47.458,"Anyhoo, tell me something..."
00:15:47.583,00:15:51.208,what situation isn't improved by pizza?
00:15:51.375,00:15:53.625,Do you happen to know a Meghan Orflosky?
00:15:53.750,00:15:55.291,Getting that right?
00:15:55.416,00:15:57.708,Orlovsky? Yeah? Good.
00:15:58.958,00:16:00.166,Because she knows you.
00:16:00.291,00:16:04.583,"Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down."
00:16:04.708,00:16:07.416,"And little Meghan, she's not made of money, but lucky for her..."
00:16:07.541,00:16:08.875,I got a soft spot.
00:16:09.583,00:16:11.500,But I'm a...
00:16:11.958,00:16:13.416,"Threats hurt, Jer."
00:16:13.541,00:16:17.000,Though not nearly as badly as serrated steel.
00:16:17.125,00:16:20.166,So keep away from Meghan.
00:16:20.291,00:16:21.291,Cool?
00:16:21.416,00:16:22.500,"Yes, sir."
00:16:22.625,00:16:23.625,Then we're done.
00:16:24.000,00:16:26.000,We are?
00:16:26.125,00:16:27.791,Yeah. We're totally done.
00:16:28.458,00:16:29.875,You should've seen your face.
00:16:30.000,00:16:31.291,I didn't know what to do.
00:16:31.541,00:16:32.583,"Soft spot, remember?"
00:16:34.125,00:16:36.125,You even look in her general direction again...
00:16:36.250,00:16:39.958,and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too.
00:16:41.958,00:16:43.333,That came out wrong.
00:16:44.458,00:16:45.666,Or did it?
00:16:58.250,00:16:59.791,Mmm... Meghan?
00:17:03.041,00:17:04.500,You've heard the last of Jeremy. He's sorry.
00:17:05.333,00:17:07.166,No friggin' way.
00:17:12.041,00:17:13.083,Should've brought my roller blades.
00:17:13.208,00:17:14.583,Show these kids how it's done.
00:17:14.708,00:17:18.041,Oh. And that's why we do it.
00:17:18.250,00:17:20.083,"Hey, think you could fuck up my step-dad?"
00:17:20.208,00:17:22.833,"I give a guy a pavement facial, it's because he's earned it."
00:17:23.500,00:17:24.791,"Hey, wait!"
00:17:26.458,00:17:27.666,You're my hero.
00:17:27.791,00:17:30.250,No-no-no-no.
00:17:31.958,00:17:34.333,WADE: Nope. Never will be.
00:17:34.458,00:17:36.333,"Oh. Fuck you, Wade."
00:17:36.458,00:17:39.958,I'm just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck up worse guys.
00:17:41.333,00:17:43.166,Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
00:17:43.291,00:17:45.458,It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
00:17:46.333,00:17:48.125,Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies...
00:17:48.250,00:17:50.833,except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
00:17:50.958,00:17:53.916,You'd best hope we never see your name on a gold card.
00:17:54.041,00:17:55.875,Buck! Liefeld...
00:17:56.250,00:17:57.250,"BUCK: Hey, Wade!"
00:17:57.583,00:17:58.750,"Wade Wilson, patron saint of the pitiful."
00:17:58.875,00:18:00.166,What can I do for you?
00:18:00.708,00:18:01.958,I'd love a Blow Job.
00:18:02.250,00:18:03.333,"Oh, God, me too."
00:18:03.500,00:18:05.583,"The drink, moose knuckle."
00:18:07.250,00:18:09.166,"Hey, and I ain't taking any babysitting money, all right?"
00:18:09.291,00:18:10.833,Make sure that gets back to Ms...
00:18:10.958,00:18:11.958,Orlovsky.
00:18:12.083,00:18:13.041,"Yeah, her."
00:18:13.166,00:18:14.416,You sure?
00:18:14.708,00:18:17.041,"You know, for a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded."
00:18:17.166,00:18:19.000,"I bet you let the kid off easy, too."
00:18:19.125,00:18:20.958,"Oh, he's not a bad kid, Weas."
00:18:21.083,00:18:22.250,Just a little light stalking.
00:18:22.375,00:18:23.916,I was way worse than him when I was his age.
00:18:24.041,00:18:25.750,I was traveling to exotic places...
00:18:25.875,00:18:30.041,"Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville, meeting new and exciting people. And then, uh..."
00:18:30.500,00:18:32.375,"Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your Instagram."
00:18:32.750,00:18:35.041,"So what was Special Forces doing in Jacksonville, anyway?"
00:18:35.166,00:18:36.666,That's classified.
00:18:36.791,00:18:38.875,a wonderful TGI Fridays.
00:18:39.083,00:18:41.291,"All right, Kahlua, Baileys and..."
00:18:41.458,00:18:42.625,whipped cream.
00:18:42.791,00:18:44.833,I give you a Blow Job.
00:18:45.333,00:18:46.666,Why do you make me make that?
00:18:46.791,00:18:48.500,"Kelly, Kelly, Kelly..."
00:18:48.625,00:18:51.916,"Take that over to Buck please, and tell him it's from Boothe."
00:18:52.041,00:18:54.250,Remind me what good will come of this?
00:18:54.375,00:18:56.333,I don't take the shits.
00:18:56.458,00:18:57.708,BUCK: Boothe!
00:18:57.833,00:18:58.958,"Easy, man."
00:18:59.083,00:19:00.041,What you want?
00:19:02.916,00:19:05.166,Cheers. To your health.
00:19:05.666,00:19:07.833,"BOOTHE: Come here, you fat fuck!"
00:19:07.958,00:19:09.416,That's a new stool.
00:19:14.291,00:19:15.708,BUCK: Stay the fuck down.
00:19:18.416,00:19:20.041,MAN: Whoa! Took his ass out!
00:19:20.166,00:19:21.875,"WEASEL: All right, move."
00:19:22.000,00:19:23.125,"Buck, go rest."
00:19:24.500,00:19:25.750,MAN: Boothe got hit then went down.
00:19:29.541,00:19:32.083,"Yeah, he's still breathing."
00:19:34.833,00:19:36.250,Nobody wins today.
00:19:36.375,00:19:38.000,"Nice try, Wade."
00:19:38.125,00:19:40.166,You got me.
00:19:40.291,00:19:41.625,Who did you pick?
00:19:41.750,00:19:43.708,"Yeah, Wade, about that, um..."
00:19:44.000,00:19:45.000,No.
00:19:45.416,00:19:47.250,You did not bet on me to die.
00:19:50.875,00:19:52.250,You bet on me to die. Wow!
00:19:52.375,00:19:53.750,"Motherfucker, you're the world's worst friend."
00:19:54.208,00:19:56.375,"Well, joke's on you."
00:19:56.500,00:19:58.541,And then dying.
00:19:58.666,00:20:01.541,I'm sorry. I just...
00:20:01.666,00:20:02.916,I never win anything.
00:20:03.041,00:20:04.041,Whatever.
00:20:04.166,00:20:05.750,"Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!"
00:20:08.208,00:20:10.083,"Domestic, nothing imported."
00:20:12.875,00:20:14.000,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
00:20:14.125,00:20:18.000,"Baby, are you sure you wanna shoot your whole wad?"
00:20:18.500,00:20:21.250,Uh... Tight.
00:20:22.916,00:20:24.875,Vanessa.
00:20:25.208,00:20:27.375,What's a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?
00:20:28.750,00:20:30.000,I'd hit that.
00:20:31.375,00:20:33.125,"Buck, you best apologize before..."
00:20:33.250,00:20:35.541,"Yeah, that."
00:20:35.750,00:20:37.333,"Say the magic words, Fat Gandalf."
00:20:37.458,00:20:39.125,I'm sorry.
00:20:39.250,00:20:41.458,I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
00:20:41.583,00:20:43.458,Let go. Okay.
00:20:43.583,00:20:44.583,Hakuna his tatas.
00:20:44.708,00:20:45.916,I'm working on it.
00:20:46.125,00:20:48.083,Get out of here.
00:20:48.666,00:20:51.083,Hey. Hands off the merchandise.
00:20:52.625,00:20:53.916,Merchandise? Huh...
00:20:54.166,00:20:56.458,"So you, uh..."
00:20:56.625,00:20:57.958,bump fuzzies for money?
00:20:58.083,00:21:00.041,Yep.
00:21:00.166,00:21:01.125,Rougher than yours.
00:21:01.250,00:21:02.833,Daddy left before I was born.
00:21:03.458,00:21:05.000,Daddy left before I was conceived.
00:21:06.208,00:21:07.541,Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
00:21:07.916,00:21:09.166,Where else do you put one out?
00:21:09.291,00:21:10.500,I was molested.
00:21:10.625,00:21:12.291,Me too. Uncle.
00:21:12.416,00:21:14.750,Uncles. They took turns.
00:21:15.041,00:21:17.583,I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet...
00:21:17.708,00:21:19.000,which also happens to be my...
00:21:19.125,00:21:21.916,Your bedroom. Lucky.
00:21:24.541,00:21:25.541,I didn't even know sleep.
00:21:25.666,00:21:29.000,"It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn."
00:21:33.041,00:21:34.291,Who would do such a thing?
00:21:35.958,00:21:39.375,"Hopefully you, later tonight?"
00:21:42.208,00:21:47.125,"Hey, what can I get for, uh, $275 and a..."
00:21:48.333,00:21:49.958,a Yogurtland rewards card?
00:21:50.083,00:21:52.708,"Baby, about 48 minutes of whatever the fuck you want."
00:21:54.208,00:21:56.000,And a low-fat dessert.
00:22:03.000,00:22:05.291,Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?
00:22:06.583,00:22:08.666,It's time to put balls in holes.
00:22:09.708,00:22:11.250,You said whatever I want.
00:22:11.958,00:22:12.958,I get it.
00:22:13.333,00:22:14.833,You love skee ball.
00:22:14.958,00:22:17.166,Apparently more than you love vagina.
00:22:17.291,00:22:19.500,That's a tough call.
00:22:19.625,00:22:21.791,"know the real you, you know."
00:22:21.916,00:22:25.750,"Not the short-shorted, two-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood."
00:22:25.875,00:22:26.833,VANESSA: Balls in holes.
00:22:28.041,00:22:29.000,Balls in holes.
00:22:29.125,00:22:30.541,Prepare to lose tragically.
00:22:30.666,00:22:31.708,"Bring it, big man."
00:22:31.833,00:22:32.833,Okay.
00:22:35.250,00:22:36.416,Uh-oh.
00:22:37.041,00:22:38.041,Uh-oh.
00:22:39.250,00:22:43.666,"The limited edition Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor."
00:22:44.083,00:22:46.583,Okay. Here we go.
00:22:47.541,00:22:49.583,Had my eye on this sucker for a while.
00:22:49.708,00:22:51.500,And I will take the pencil eraser.
00:22:51.625,00:22:53.000,BOY: Okay.
00:22:53.125,00:22:55.875,You are now the protector of the planet Arus.
00:22:56.000,00:22:57.875,And you can erase stuff...
00:22:58.000,00:22:59.333,written in pencil.
00:22:59.708,00:23:01.041,M'lady?
00:23:01.166,00:23:02.333,"Well, I hate to break it to you..."
00:23:02.458,00:23:04.291,but your 48 minutes are up.
00:23:04.791,00:23:07.541,"Hey, how many more minutes can I get for this?"
00:23:07.666,00:23:12.166,"FYI, five mini lion-bots come together to form one super-bot, so..."
00:23:12.500,00:23:15.500,Five mini lion-bots?
00:23:15.625,00:23:16.541,Deal.
00:23:16.666,00:23:19.041,"What do we do with the remaining two minutes, 37 seconds?"
00:23:19.875,00:23:20.875,Cuddle?
00:23:25.250,00:23:26.750,How long can you keep this up?
00:23:26.958,00:23:28.041,All year?
00:23:38.708,00:23:40.541,Happy Valentine's Day.
00:23:48.166,00:23:49.708,Happy Chinese New Year.
00:23:49.833,00:23:51.166,Year of the Dog.
00:23:56.333,00:23:57.500,Relax.
00:23:58.083,00:24:00.291,And Happy International Women's Day.
00:24:10.291,00:24:11.416,Happy Lent.
00:24:15.416,00:24:16.541,"Ow, ow."
00:24:16.666,00:24:17.875,Wade?
00:24:18.000,00:24:19.375,Happy Halloween.
00:24:19.500,00:24:20.541,Happy Halloween.
00:24:30.291,00:24:32.041,Happy Thanksgiving.
00:24:34.041,00:24:35.208,I love you.
00:24:39.041,00:24:41.041,If your left leg is Thanksgiving...
00:24:41.166,00:24:42.875,and your right leg is Christmas...
00:24:44.208,00:24:45.708,can I visit you between the holidays?
00:24:46.541,00:24:47.541,Oh!
00:24:47.666,00:24:49.416,That sweater is terrible.
00:24:50.666,00:24:52.083,But red looks good on you.
00:24:52.208,00:24:53.166,Red's your color.
00:24:53.291,00:24:55.083,Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.
00:24:56.041,00:24:57.041,"Listen, I've been thinking..."
00:24:57.166,00:24:58.166,Really?
00:24:58.958,00:25:00.666,...about why we're so good together.
00:25:01.041,00:25:02.125,Why's that?
00:25:02.958,00:25:06.666,"Well, your crazy matches my crazy. Big time."
00:25:08.833,00:25:11.750,"And, uh, we're like two jigsaw pieces, you know, the weird curvy edges..."
00:25:12.083,00:25:14.500,You put them together and you can see the picture on top.
00:25:15.333,00:25:16.416,Right.
00:25:17.000,00:25:18.083,Wade...
00:25:18.791,00:25:21.208,there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
00:25:21.333,00:25:23.916,But only because you haven't gotten around to asking me.
00:25:26.083,00:25:27.166,"Will you, uh..."
00:25:28.375,00:25:30.250,stick it in my...
00:25:32.000,00:25:34.208,Uh... Jinx?
00:25:34.333,00:25:35.333,Huh.
00:25:36.166,00:25:37.250,Where were you hiding that?
00:25:37.375,00:25:38.416,Nowhere.
00:25:39.416,00:25:41.041,They say one month's salary.
00:25:41.166,00:25:42.083,You mean?
00:25:42.208,00:25:43.166,I do.
00:25:43.291,00:25:44.291,That's my line.
00:25:47.666,00:25:49.291,"I love you, Wade Wilson."
00:25:50.125,00:25:51.375,You're supposed to...
00:25:51.500,00:25:52.958,Yes!
00:25:53.708,00:25:54.750,Yes!
00:25:56.958,00:25:58.375,I feel just like a little girl.
00:26:03.708,00:26:06.083,What if I just held on and never let go?
00:26:06.208,00:26:08.750,"Just ride a bitch's back, like Yoda on Luke."
00:26:08.875,00:26:11.208,"Oh, Star Wars jokes."
00:26:11.708,00:26:12.916,Empire.
00:26:14.375,00:26:15.583,Jesus Christ.
00:26:15.708,00:26:17.583,It's like I made you in a computer.
00:26:19.416,00:26:20.416,Mmm.
00:26:21.875,00:26:22.875,Hey.
00:26:23.958,00:26:25.375,Perfect.
00:26:29.125,00:26:30.541,Let's see.
00:26:30.666,00:26:31.916,"Shake it, yeah."
00:26:38.166,00:26:39.333,WADE: Here's the thing.
00:26:39.708,00:26:41.541,Life is an endless series of train-wrecks...
00:26:41.666,00:26:45.208,"with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness."
00:26:46.208,00:26:48.875,This had been the ultimate commercial break.
00:26:51.416,00:26:54.541,Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.
00:26:54.666,00:26:56.458,What the...
00:26:56.583,00:26:57.666,"Oh, my God. Wade?"
00:27:03.958,00:27:05.250,You're clowning.
00:27:05.750,00:27:07.083,You're not clowning?
00:27:07.500,00:27:08.500,I sense clowns.
00:27:08.916,00:27:12.208,People react to news of late-stage cancer differently.
00:27:12.333,00:27:15.083,There are certainly options we can look into.
00:27:15.208,00:27:16.958,New drugs are being developed every day.
00:27:21.541,00:27:22.625,So what do we do?
00:27:23.125,00:27:25.500,Surely there is something we can do.
00:27:26.625,00:27:29.250,My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer...
00:27:29.375,00:27:31.750,and there were all these new experimental drugs from Germany.
00:27:31.875,00:27:36.208,"WADE: Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z."
00:27:36.500,00:27:40.041,Me? I'm memorizing the details of her face.
00:27:40.708,00:27:43.041,Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
00:27:43.166,00:27:44.208,Or the last.
00:27:44.333,00:27:45.791,DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson...
00:27:45.916,00:27:47.333,Mr. Wilson?
00:27:47.708,00:27:50.000,Take your time to process this.
00:27:51.041,00:27:52.958,It's important not to do anything rash.
00:28:04.458,00:28:09.666,"Now, if I were a 200-pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide?"
00:28:13.666,00:28:14.666,Oh.
00:28:35.208,00:28:39.375,WADE: A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson...
00:28:39.500,00:28:42.958,"out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
00:28:44.791,00:28:46.458,His form looks good.
00:28:47.333,00:28:48.416,Oh!
00:28:48.541,00:28:52.416,And that's why Regina rhymes with fun.
00:28:53.041,00:28:55.291,"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing..."
00:28:55.416,00:28:57.666,is sweet dick-kicking revenge.
00:28:58.708,00:29:00.125,Oh! Giving him the business.
00:29:00.583,00:29:01.625,Incoming!
00:29:02.750,00:29:06.458,This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!
00:29:11.875,00:29:13.750,"Looking good, Francis."
00:29:13.875,00:29:15.541,"Like you've been pitching, not catching."
00:29:16.083,00:29:18.000,Ringing any bells? No?
00:29:23.000,00:29:24.208,How about now?
00:29:28.208,00:29:30.375,Wade fucking Wilson.
00:29:32.916,00:29:34.166,"FRANCIS: Well, hello, gorgeous."
00:29:34.291,00:29:37.208,"WADE: Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar-Pei."
00:29:37.333,00:29:40.458,"Yeah. And whose fault is that, huh, Francis?"
00:29:40.583,00:29:42.500,"Yeah, time to undo what you did to this butterface."
00:29:42.625,00:29:44.291,"Please, you should thank me."
00:29:44.416,00:29:45.625,"Apparently, I made you immortal."
00:29:45.958,00:29:47.500,I'm actually quite jealous.
00:29:47.625,00:29:49.916,"Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it?"
00:29:51.958,00:29:56.041,"Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late 90s."
00:29:58.250,00:29:59.208,Dad?
00:30:02.708,00:30:07.250,WADE: I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.
00:30:08.291,00:30:10.250,"Well, maybe not the most."
00:30:10.750,00:30:14.583,WADE: Uh... This is my most prized possession.
00:30:15.125,00:30:16.166,VANESSA: Wham?
00:30:16.291,00:30:18.125,"No, no, no. Wham!"
00:30:18.625,00:30:22.041,Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.
00:30:23.125,00:30:26.000,"So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?"
00:30:26.125,00:30:27.500,Think of it like spring cleaning.
00:30:27.625,00:30:28.916,Only if spring was death.
00:30:29.041,00:30:33.000,"God, if I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters."
00:30:34.000,00:30:35.458,Sounds like you do.
00:30:36.291,00:30:40.083,"Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere."
00:30:40.208,00:30:41.166,Drink.
00:30:41.333,00:30:42.666,You're right.
00:30:41.333,00:30:44.041,"Cancer is only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain."
00:30:44.166,00:30:45.375,All things I can live without.
00:30:46.583,00:30:47.583,Ha.
00:30:47.708,00:30:49.625,You belong here at home.
00:30:49.750,00:30:53.375,"Surrounded by your Voltron and your Bernadette, and your me."
00:30:54.708,00:30:58.250,"Listen, we both know that cancer is a shit-show."
00:30:59.916,00:31:04.833,"Like, a Yakov-Smirnoff- opening-for-the Spin-Doctors- at-the- Iowa-State-Fair shit-show."
00:31:06.916,00:31:11.500,And under no circumstances will I take you to that show.
00:31:12.833,00:31:14.500,I want you to remember me.
00:31:16.000,00:31:17.750,Not the ghost of Christmas me.
00:31:17.875,00:31:19.666,"Well, I wanna remember us."
00:31:20.166,00:31:21.708,"I swear to God, I will find you in the next life..."
00:31:21.833,00:31:24.833,and I'm gonna boom-box Careless Whisper outside your window.
00:31:24.958,00:31:26.375,Wham!
00:31:29.791,00:31:32.791,No one is boom-boxing shit.
00:31:35.375,00:31:36.791,We can fight this.
00:31:40.041,00:31:42.208,"Besides, I just realized something."
00:31:43.041,00:31:45.333,You win.
00:31:43.041,00:31:48.125,Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.
00:31:52.541,00:31:53.541,I love you.
00:32:05.166,00:32:06.333,Wade.
00:32:08.500,00:32:09.625,Weas.
00:32:09.750,00:32:12.208,You look like you need a Blow Job and a shower.
00:32:12.333,00:32:14.375,Though courtesy calls for the latter first.
00:32:14.500,00:32:16.083,How about three shots of Patron?
00:32:16.208,00:32:19.916,"Or how about Triticum aestivum, wheatgrass."
00:32:20.041,00:32:21.375,Excellent for the immune system.
00:32:21.500,00:32:23.500,Jesus Christ.
00:32:23.625,00:32:24.708,"Here, check it out."
00:32:24.833,00:32:28.166,She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.
00:32:28.333,00:32:30.083,I'm sure they're all FDA approved.
00:32:30.583,00:32:33.416,Chechnya. Isn't that where you go to get cancer?
00:32:33.583,00:32:36.291,You got China and Central Mexico.
00:32:36.750,00:32:38.916,You know how they say cancer in Spanish?
00:32:39.083,00:32:40.083,No.
00:32:40.750,00:32:42.291,El Cancer.
00:32:42.416,00:32:44.250,I could have guessed that.
00:32:44.750,00:32:46.041,Look how happy you look here.
00:32:46.166,00:32:47.750,Mind if I keep this?
00:32:46.166,00:32:50.250,"Put it up, so I can remember when you looked alive."
00:32:50.750,00:32:52.625,At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool.
00:32:52.750,00:32:55.375,Now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer.
00:32:55.500,00:32:57.250,"I got it, Weas. Thanks."
00:32:57.375,00:32:58.500,Oh.
00:32:59.875,00:33:02.458,"And, uh, that guy over there came in looking for you."
00:33:02.583,00:33:05.375,Real Grim Reaper type.
00:33:05.500,00:33:07.458,I don't know.
00:33:11.541,00:33:12.541,Boothe.
00:33:12.666,00:33:13.791,Wade.
00:33:19.000,00:33:20.041,Mr. Wilson.
00:33:20.541,00:33:21.666,How can I help you?
00:33:21.791,00:33:24.375,Besides luring children into a panel van.
00:33:24.500,00:33:28.041,I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
00:33:28.166,00:33:29.250,Stalker alert.
00:33:29.375,00:33:31.541,It's my job.
00:33:32.250,00:33:34.666,I'm sorry you've had such a tough go.
00:33:35.791,00:33:37.916,But you're a fighter.
00:33:38.125,00:33:40.458,41 confirmed kills.
00:33:41.000,00:33:42.333,One every seven weeks.
00:33:42.458,00:33:44.833,Same rate most folks get a haircut. Hmm...
00:33:45.583,00:33:46.791,It's to wash the taste out.
00:33:46.916,00:33:50.000,It's tough to forget being so impressive.
00:33:50.375,00:33:54.291,And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people...
00:33:54.416,00:33:56.000,People change.
00:33:56.416,00:33:59.500,I represent an organization that may be able to help.
00:34:01.416,00:34:05.083,What if I told you we can cure your cancer?
00:34:05.708,00:34:09.791,"And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of?"
00:34:13.458,00:34:17.416,"I'd say that you sound like an infomercial, but not a good one, like Slap Chop."
00:34:17.541,00:34:19.083,More Shake Weight-y.
00:34:19.208,00:34:22.166,The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
00:34:22.291,00:34:24.333,We won't just make you better.
00:34:24.458,00:34:27.541,We will make you better than better.
00:34:28.541,00:34:29.791,A superhero.
00:34:30.125,00:34:35.125,"Look, Agent Smith, I tried the hero business and it left a mark."
00:34:35.583,00:34:38.208,"But if I ever hit fuck it, I'll look you up."
00:34:38.916,00:34:40.125,"Oh, um..."
00:34:40.625,00:34:43.458,"Shit. We're within 500 yards of a school, so you may wanna..."
00:34:48.458,00:34:49.708,His drink's on him.
00:34:55.333,00:34:57.000,WEASEL: What did he say?
00:35:19.750,00:35:21.291,"VANESSA: Hey, what's going on?"
00:35:25.291,00:35:27.291,I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.
00:35:28.166,00:35:31.333,I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.
00:35:39.041,00:35:43.208,"Hey, uh, they've made three of those movies."
00:35:44.208,00:35:47.333,At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.
00:35:47.458,00:35:48.500,Hmm.
00:36:01.833,00:36:05.458,WADE: The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you...
00:36:05.833,00:36:08.708,but what it does to the people you love.
00:36:09.000,00:36:11.500,Who knew if this guy could save my life...
00:36:11.625,00:36:14.250,but I knew there was only one way that I could save hers.
00:36:18.416,00:36:20.666,Isn't that what superheroes do?
00:36:33.083,00:36:37.166,WADE: Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing.
00:36:37.833,00:36:38.916,Ow.
00:36:39.041,00:36:41.916,Pro: They pull down a gaggle of ass.
00:36:42.041,00:36:43.375,Local dry cleaning discounts.
00:36:43.500,00:36:47.416,"Lucrative film deals, both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies."
00:36:47.541,00:36:50.541,Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.
00:36:50.666,00:36:52.375,"You know, I can hear you."
00:36:52.500,00:36:55.333,I wasn't talking to you.
00:36:55.458,00:36:57.125,Stay right here.
00:36:57.791,00:36:59.833,"COLOSSUS: You've been warned before, Deadpool."
00:37:00.125,00:37:03.666,This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers.
00:37:03.791,00:37:05.833,You will both be coming with us.
00:37:05.958,00:37:09.875,"WADE: Look, Colossus, I don't have time for the goody two-shoes bullshit right now!"
00:37:10.000,00:37:11.875,And you are?
00:37:13.541,00:37:15.291,Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
00:37:15.416,00:37:18.791,Negasonic Teenage...
00:37:18.916,00:37:20.708,That's the coolest name ever!
00:37:22.208,00:37:24.750,"So, what, you're like, uh, his sidekick?"
00:37:24.875,00:37:26.291,No. Trainee.
00:37:26.416,00:37:27.791,Let me guess.
00:37:27.916,00:37:30.333,X-Men left you behind on what? Shit detail?
00:37:30.458,00:37:31.500,What does that make you?
00:37:31.625,00:37:33.958,"Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead."
00:37:34.083,00:37:35.291,Can we trade names?
00:37:35.416,00:37:36.916,Can we go?
00:37:37.041,00:37:39.291,WADE: Look!
00:37:39.416,00:37:41.541,I'd rather be anywhere than here.
00:37:41.666,00:37:43.791,I'm all about long sullen silences...
00:37:43.916,00:37:47.375,"followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
00:37:47.833,00:37:51.000,"So what's it gonna be, huh?"
00:37:51.125,00:37:53.708,or mean comment? Go on.
00:37:55.083,00:37:56.166,You got me in a box here.
00:37:56.291,00:37:57.291,Aha!
00:37:57.416,00:37:59.291,"We can't allow this, Deadpool."
00:37:59.416,00:38:00.791,"Please, come quietly."
00:38:00.916,00:38:03.125,You big chrome cock-gobbler!
00:38:03.250,00:38:04.166,COLOSSUS: That's not nice.
00:38:04.291,00:38:05.791,You're really gonna fuck this up for me?
00:38:06.125,00:38:10.458,"Trust me, that wheezing bag of dick-tips has it coming."
00:38:10.583,00:38:13.125,He's pure evil.
00:38:13.500,00:38:16.791,Besides...
00:38:22.041,00:38:24.166,That guy was already up there when I got here.
00:38:24.291,00:38:27.333,"Wade, you are better than this."
00:38:27.583,00:38:29.916,Join us.
00:38:30.041,00:38:31.000,WADE: Heads up.
00:38:31.125,00:38:32.333,Be a superhero.
00:38:32.458,00:38:33.416,WADE: Listen!
00:38:33.541,00:38:35.916,The day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler...
00:38:36.041,00:38:39.333,who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners at the Neverland mansion...
00:38:39.458,00:38:44.250,"of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking motherfucker..."
00:38:44.375,00:38:46.083,on that day...
00:38:46.208,00:38:48.333,"I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend request."
00:38:48.458,00:38:50.916,"But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do."
00:38:51.041,00:38:53.666,Either that or slap the bitch outta you!
00:38:53.791,00:38:55.000,COLOSSUS: Wade...
00:38:55.125,00:38:56.208,"Zip it, Sinead!"
00:38:56.333,00:38:57.291,"Hey, douche-pool!"
00:38:57.416,00:38:58.666,And I hope you're watching...
00:39:03.416,00:39:05.166,Quite unfortunate.
00:39:08.583,00:39:10.791,That does it!
00:39:12.250,00:39:13.250,Oh!
00:39:17.916,00:39:18.875,That's not good.
00:39:19.000,00:39:20.083,"COLOSSUS: Wade, please."
00:39:20.208,00:39:22.666,WADE: Cock shot!
00:39:23.083,00:39:24.750,"Oh, your poor wife."
00:39:24.875,00:39:26.666,You really should stop.
00:39:30.250,00:39:32.666,All the dinosaurs feared the T. rex.
00:39:37.333,00:39:39.416,"WADE: I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!"
00:39:39.541,00:39:41.375,This is embarrassing.
00:39:41.500,00:39:43.208,"Please, stay down."
00:39:44.291,00:39:46.666,WADE: You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?
00:39:46.791,00:39:48.166,Do you have off switch?
00:39:48.291,00:39:49.875,"Yeah, it's right next to the prostate."
00:39:50.000,00:39:51.041,Or is that the on switch?
00:39:51.166,00:39:53.166,Enough!
00:40:01.875,00:40:03.708,COLOSSUS: Let us go talk to the Professor.
00:40:04.208,00:40:05.916,McAvoy or Stewart?
00:40:06.041,00:40:08.250,These timelines are so confusing.
00:40:09.583,00:40:12.166,"Dead or alive, you're coming with me!"
00:40:12.291,00:40:13.875,"COLOSSUS: You will recover, Wade."
00:40:14.125,00:40:15.666,You always do.
00:40:20.250,00:40:23.708,You ever see 127 Hours?
00:40:27.375,00:40:28.458,"Oh, my God."
00:40:28.583,00:40:29.666,Nasty.
00:40:32.750,00:40:34.041,"WADE: Oh, there's the money shot, baby."
00:40:35.333,00:40:37.250,Are You There God?
00:40:48.375,00:40:50.750,"WADE: Rock, meet bottom."
00:40:51.250,00:40:54.250,And when life ends up breathtakingly fucked...
00:40:54.541,00:40:58.666,"you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision."
00:40:58.791,00:41:01.916,The one that sent you down the road to Shitsburgh.
00:41:02.041,00:41:05.083,"This? Well, this was mine."
00:41:05.666,00:41:07.041,AGENT SMITH: Mr. Wilson.
00:41:08.458,00:41:12.875,Nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's.
00:41:13.000,00:41:14.708,You finally hit fuck it.
00:41:15.875,00:41:17.875,Just promise you'll do right by me.
00:41:18.541,00:41:20.500,So I can do right by someone else.
00:41:20.625,00:41:21.833,Of course.
00:41:22.541,00:41:24.375,And please don't make the super-suit green.
00:41:25.625,00:41:27.125,Or animated.
00:41:33.625,00:41:35.166,MAN: Move it! Keep moving.
00:41:47.291,00:41:49.375,This place seems sanitary.
00:41:50.166,00:41:52.291,My first request is warmer hands.
00:41:52.416,00:41:56.208,"Oh! And, Jesus, a warmer table."
00:41:57.750,00:41:59.875,"We should really come up with a safe word, fellas."
00:42:00.000,00:42:01.833,I'm thinking pork and beans.
00:42:09.416,00:42:11.666,Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
00:42:12.458,00:42:13.833,I'm calling wang.
00:42:17.750,00:42:18.958,What's up with the matches?
00:42:19.250,00:42:21.958,Oral fixation or just a big Stallone fan?
00:42:23.500,00:42:24.791,"Patience, Angel."
00:42:25.750,00:42:27.333,All in good time.
00:42:27.500,00:42:29.375,"Are you here for the turndown service, or what?"
00:42:30.958,00:42:32.000,We have another talker.
00:42:32.125,00:42:34.000,I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
00:42:34.125,00:42:36.291,Shut the fuck up.
00:42:39.541,00:42:41.500,"Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax."
00:42:42.541,00:42:44.625,I manage this workshop.
00:42:45.750,00:42:49.000,"Ah, my welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like..."
00:42:49.125,00:42:50.541,This may hurt a little.
00:42:50.666,00:42:52.625,This may cause you some discomfort.
00:42:52.750,00:42:55.000,But I've grown blunt.
00:42:55.125,00:42:57.666,This workshop is not a government-led program.
00:42:57.791,00:43:01.333,It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself...
00:43:01.458,00:43:04.791,into men of extraordinary abilities.
00:43:06.458,00:43:09.708,But if you think super-human powers are acquired painlessly...
00:43:10.625,00:43:11.958,Wrong.
00:43:12.083,00:43:13.541,I'm injecting you with a serum...
00:43:13.666,00:43:16.291,that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
00:43:16.416,00:43:20.333,For it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress.
00:43:25.791,00:43:29.083,"You've heard that whole make an omelet, break some eggs bit, right?"
00:43:29.916,00:43:31.333,"I'm about to hurt you, Wade."
00:43:32.500,00:43:35.041,"I was a patient here once myself, you know."
00:43:35.583,00:43:38.083,The treatment affects everyone differently.
00:43:38.416,00:43:41.250,It made Angel inhumanly strong.
00:43:41.583,00:43:45.583,"In my case, it enhanced my reflexes."
00:43:46.083,00:43:49.041,"Also scorched my nerve endings, so I no longer feel pain."
00:43:50.750,00:43:54.541,"And, in fact, I no longer feel anything."
00:44:03.041,00:44:05.833,Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.
00:44:06.125,00:44:07.875,You have something in your teeth.
00:44:08.833,00:44:11.000,Right in the middle there.
00:44:11.125,00:44:14.125,A little nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
00:44:16.041,00:44:18.458,It's been bothering me for a long time.
00:44:19.916,00:44:20.958,"Ah, made you look."
00:44:21.250,00:44:22.833,"Hey, is Ajax your actual name?"
00:44:22.958,00:44:24.625,Because it sounds suspiciously made up.
00:44:24.750,00:44:25.791,"What is it, really?"
00:44:25.916,00:44:28.125,Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
00:44:28.250,00:44:29.833,Mitch? The Rickster?
00:44:30.625,00:44:32.125,Is it Basil Fawlty?
00:44:32.458,00:44:33.958,"Oh, joke away."
00:44:34.416,00:44:37.250,One thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
00:44:37.750,00:44:38.833,We'll see about that.
00:44:38.958,00:44:40.333,I suppose we will.
00:44:41.750,00:44:43.250,He's all yours.
00:44:43.375,00:44:44.583,"Oh, come on."
00:44:45.083,00:44:46.458,You're gonna leave me all alone here.
00:44:46.583,00:44:48.208,with less-angry Rosie O'Donnell?
00:44:52.666,00:44:54.666,FRANCIS: This is how it's going to work.
00:44:54.791,00:44:57.791,Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum...
00:44:58.416,00:45:00.916,so we're going to have to make you suffer.
00:45:02.666,00:45:07.500,"FRANCIS: If you're lucky, the mutant genes will activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion."
00:45:11.791,00:45:14.541,"FRANCIS: If not, well, we'll have to keep on hurting you..."
00:45:16.416,00:45:19.125,"in new and different ways, each more painful than the last..."
00:45:21.791,00:45:24.125,until you finally mutate.
00:45:25.750,00:45:26.958,Or die.
00:45:33.875,00:45:35.416,CUNNINGHAM: You mean a bucket list?
00:45:35.541,00:45:37.750,WADE: Like a fuck-it list.
00:45:37.875,00:45:40.541,I'd really like to light a spliff off the Olympic torch.
00:45:41.125,00:45:42.916,CUNNINGHAM: Pass it to me right after.
00:45:43.041,00:45:49.000,Let's not forget naked tandem base-jumping with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
00:45:50.041,00:45:53.166,Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.
00:45:53.666,00:45:56.541,"Finally, giving Meredith Baxter-Birney a Dutch oven."
00:45:56.833,00:45:59.916,No. Receiving a Dutch oven from Meredith Baxter-Birney.
00:46:04.583,00:46:08.000,Making banana pancakes for my kids.
00:46:11.458,00:46:13.500,Vanessa.
00:46:17.083,00:46:19.375,WADE: I wanna see Vanessa.
00:46:19.500,00:46:20.791,FRANCIS: You're lovely.
00:46:20.916,00:46:24.250,"I don't know about anyone else, but I'm touched."
00:46:24.375,00:46:25.291,We were just joking.
00:46:25.416,00:46:27.750,"No, no. It's okay."
00:46:28.916,00:46:30.583,I encourage distractions.
00:46:31.375,00:46:33.625,"Wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we?"
00:46:33.750,00:46:35.583,"Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham."
00:46:36.583,00:46:38.833,How tough can he be...
00:46:39.000,00:46:41.875,with a name like Francis?
00:46:42.458,00:46:43.541,Francis?
00:46:43.875,00:46:45.291,WADE: That's his legal name.
00:46:45.875,00:46:49.375,from the dish soap.
00:46:51.375,00:46:55.000,"F, R, A, N, C, I..."
00:46:55.500,00:46:56.916,Oops!
00:46:58.708,00:47:01.583,Snagged the dry cleaning tag off your lab coat.
00:47:03.458,00:47:05.833,"FYI, I could probably get you the superhero discount."
00:47:05.958,00:47:07.291,You are so relentlessly annoying.
00:47:07.416,00:47:08.333,Thanks.
00:47:08.458,00:47:09.666,Never heard that before.
00:47:09.791,00:47:12.958,Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up?
00:47:13.083,00:47:15.083,Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
00:47:15.541,00:47:16.750,Oh...
00:47:16.875,00:47:18.458,I wouldn't do that if I were you.
00:47:18.625,00:47:21.791,"See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture..."
00:47:21.916,00:47:24.875,is that you can't really step it up from there.
00:47:27.500,00:47:29.833,Is that what you think?
00:47:35.083,00:47:37.625,"If this doesn't unlock your mutation, then, well..."
00:47:38.500,00:47:39.833,nothing will.
00:47:40.250,00:47:43.166,"Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in the air..."
00:47:43.291,00:47:45.916,to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
00:47:46.166,00:47:49.333,"If your brainwaves slow, meaning you're about to pass out..."
00:47:50.000,00:47:51.166,then we'll turn up the O2.
00:47:52.166,00:47:53.541,If your heart rate slows...
00:47:53.666,00:47:56.250,meaning you're able to catch your breath...
00:47:56.416,00:47:57.791,we'll turn it back down.
00:47:58.416,00:47:59.875,And that's where we'll leave you.
00:48:00.000,00:48:02.083,Right there.
00:48:02.458,00:48:04.625,"Oh, and I thought you guys were dicks before."
00:48:04.750,00:48:07.125,FRANCIS: You know the funniest part of this?
00:48:07.916,00:48:10.291,You still think we're making you a superhero.
00:48:11.125,00:48:14.583,You. A dishonorable discharge.
00:48:15.291,00:48:17.375,Hip-deep in hookers.
00:48:18.083,00:48:19.791,You're nothing.
00:48:20.708,00:48:22.208,"Little secret, Wade."
00:48:23.041,00:48:27.125,"This workshop doesn't make superheroes, we make super-slaves."
00:48:28.208,00:48:31.958,We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder.
00:48:32.708,00:48:34.125,Who knows what they'll have you doing?
00:48:34.958,00:48:38.375,"Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters."
00:48:40.541,00:48:43.375,Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.
00:48:43.875,00:48:46.333,What the fuck is wrong with you?
00:48:51.583,00:48:54.291,You're never going home after this.
00:48:54.458,00:48:56.666,Now there's a brave face.
00:48:57.666,00:48:59.250,"Wait, wait! Wait. Wait."
00:49:01.666,00:49:05.583,"Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now."
00:49:07.500,00:49:08.875,Enjoy your weekend.
00:49:09.250,00:49:10.875,Weekend? Back up.
00:49:11.000,00:49:12.208,Weekend?
00:49:53.916,00:49:55.916,WADE: Did I say this was a love story?
00:49:56.041,00:49:58.458,"No, it's a horror movie."
00:50:14.916,00:50:16.958,FRANCIS: Fucking hell.
00:50:17.083,00:50:20.250,Looks like someone lost his shot at Homecoming King.
00:50:20.416,00:50:22.375,What have you done to me?
00:50:22.583,00:50:25.833,I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.
00:50:26.000,00:50:28.166,You sadistic fuck!
00:50:28.833,00:50:30.333,"I've cured you, Wade."
00:50:31.166,00:50:32.833,Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
00:50:33.958,00:50:36.666,It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form.
00:50:37.958,00:50:40.500,"Yeah, I've seen similar side-effects before."
00:50:41.833,00:50:42.833,I could cure them...
00:50:46.458,00:50:48.125,but where's the fun in that?
00:50:50.416,00:50:52.958,"Now, I'm gonna shut you in again, Wade."
00:50:54.750,00:50:56.708,Not because I need to.
00:51:00.625,00:51:02.375,Because I want to.
00:51:16.875,00:51:18.000,"Oh, well."
00:51:18.375,00:51:19.583,Go ahead.
00:51:22.625,00:51:24.375,"Oh, you smell like shit."
00:51:27.708,00:51:28.708,ANGEL DUST: Motherfucker.
00:51:29.666,00:51:31.541,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:51:32.625,00:51:34.500,"I think we owe him that one, yeah?"
00:51:34.625,00:51:37.000,You take off. Go on.
00:51:37.791,00:51:39.125,Off you go.
00:51:50.208,00:51:51.833,Quick question.
00:51:54.083,00:51:56.083,What's my name?
00:52:01.875,00:52:03.208,Didn't think so.
00:52:05.083,00:52:07.791,"WADE: Sorry, Francis."
00:54:04.291,00:54:05.583,You don't want to kill me.
00:54:05.708,00:54:08.000,I'm the only one who can fix your ugly mug.
00:55:04.708,00:55:06.208,What's my name?
00:55:12.375,00:55:13.541,CUNNINGHAM: Wade.
00:56:20.958,00:56:23.958,WADE: I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
00:56:25.458,00:56:28.125,I got the cure to el everything.
00:56:31.791,00:56:33.916,But there was only one thing...
00:56:34.083,00:56:35.708,that really mattered.
00:57:05.208,00:57:06.166,"WOMAN: Come on, let's go."
00:57:11.583,00:57:14.291,"WOMAN: Oh, that must hurt."
00:57:15.291,00:57:16.750,Thank you so much.
00:57:28.750,00:57:30.916,"God, he's so fucking gnarly."
00:57:31.041,00:57:32.375,WOMAN: Look at his face.
00:57:32.500,00:57:34.791,"MAN: Oh, my God. Poor guy."
00:57:34.916,00:57:35.916,"FEMALE PEDESTRIAN: Honey, don't stare."
00:57:36.083,00:57:37.250,MALE PEDESTRIAN: Freak.
00:57:57.541,00:58:00.875,No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine.
00:58:01.166,00:58:03.625,"Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad."
00:58:03.833,00:58:05.083,"Ah, bullshit!"
00:58:05.250,00:58:08.375,I'm a monster inside and out.
00:58:08.500,00:58:11.041,"Wade, Vanessa loves you."
00:58:11.166,00:58:12.583,Oh! Oh.
00:58:12.833,00:58:13.916,Do you like what you see?
00:58:14.041,00:58:15.208,No.
00:58:15.708,00:58:19.625,"You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado."
00:58:19.750,00:58:20.750,Yeah.
00:58:20.916,00:58:22.875,Not gently.
00:58:23.041,00:58:24.833,There was something wrong with the relationship...
00:58:24.958,00:58:28.500,and that was the only catharsis that they could find without violence.
00:58:28.708,00:58:31.083,And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug...
00:58:31.208,00:58:33.833,is the British shitstick who ran the mutant factory.
00:58:34.000,00:58:35.750,And he's gone. Poof!
00:58:35.916,00:58:37.583,"Yeah, well you gotta do something to remedy this..."
00:58:37.708,00:58:40.583,"because as of now, you only have one course of action."
00:58:40.750,00:58:41.875,Damn straight.
00:58:42.041,00:58:43.750,Find Francis.
00:58:43.875,00:58:44.916,What?
00:58:45.041,00:58:47.041,Star in your own horror films.
00:58:47.166,00:58:51.125,Because you look like Freddy Krueger face-fucked a topographical map of Utah.
00:58:51.958,00:58:53.666,Here's what I'm actually gonna do.
00:58:53.791,00:58:56.333,I'm gonna work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis...
00:58:56.458,00:58:58.791,"force him to fix this, then put a bullet in his skull..."
00:58:58.916,00:59:00.500,and fuck the brain hole.
00:59:00.625,00:59:03.625,I don't wanna see that or think of it again.
00:59:03.791,00:59:05.791,"But the douchebag does thinks you're dead, right?"
00:59:05.916,00:59:06.833,Yeah.
00:59:06.958,00:59:08.541,That's good.
00:59:08.666,00:59:10.291,"What, like, wear a mask?"
00:59:10.375,00:59:13.291,Yes. A very thick mask.
00:59:13.916,00:59:14.958,I am sorry...
00:59:15.083,00:59:17.583,you are haunting.
00:59:17.750,00:59:19.625,Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
00:59:19.750,00:59:21.000,Like a testicle with teeth.
00:59:21.125,00:59:22.791,You will die alone.
00:59:22.916,00:59:24.583,"I mean, if you could die."
00:59:25.125,00:59:27.166,"Ideally, for others' sake."
00:59:27.291,00:59:28.500,That'll do.
00:59:28.833,00:59:30.541,All you need now is a suit and a nickname...
00:59:30.666,00:59:32.500,like Wade the Wisecracker...
00:59:32.958,00:59:36.041,"or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie."
00:59:36.666,00:59:37.958,"Oh, shit."
00:59:38.500,00:59:39.625,What?
00:59:40.458,00:59:42.375,I put all my money on you and now...
00:59:42.500,00:59:43.875,"I just realized I'm never gonna win the, uh..."
00:59:44.000,00:59:45.041,Dead pool.
00:59:49.000,00:59:51.291,Captain Deadpool...
00:59:53.125,00:59:54.166,"No, just..."
00:59:54.291,00:59:55.833,"Just Deadpool, yeah."
00:59:56.083,00:59:58.000,"To you, Mr. Pool."
00:59:58.291,00:59:59.291,Deadpool.
00:59:59.416,01:00:00.791,That sounds like a fucking franchise.
01:00:15.500,01:00:17.541,This shit's gonna have nuts in it.
01:00:18.208,01:00:19.666,Where's Francis?
01:00:33.708,01:00:35.333,WADE: Where's Francis?
01:00:43.666,01:00:45.625,AL: Seltzer water and lemon for blood.
01:00:46.958,01:00:49.875,Or wear red. Dumbass.
01:01:08.625,01:01:10.083,WADE: Don't make me ask twice.
01:01:11.458,01:01:12.750,Where...
01:01:12.916,01:01:15.041,is Francis?
01:01:15.541,01:01:17.208,He made me ask twice.
01:01:17.333,01:01:19.333,Is the mask muffling my voice?
01:01:24.083,01:01:25.541,Where's Francis?
01:01:28.208,01:01:30.041,Where the fuck is Francis?
01:01:38.791,01:01:42.000,You're about to be killed by a Zamboni.
01:01:42.166,01:01:43.333,Where's Francis?
01:01:44.791,01:01:45.958,No! Please!
01:01:46.583,01:01:49.375,"Oh, God! I'm so sorry!"
01:01:50.583,01:01:53.166,Oh! You little spider monkey!
01:01:56.291,01:01:59.666,Where... is... Francis?
01:02:00.875,01:02:02.000,This is confusing.
01:02:02.125,01:02:03.416,Is it sexist to hit you?
01:02:03.541,01:02:05.000,Is it more sexist to not hit you?
01:02:05.125,01:02:07.416,"I mean, the line gets real... blurry."
01:02:07.583,01:02:09.416,Where is Francis?
01:02:11.291,01:02:14.666,Tell me where your fucking boss is or you're gonna die!
01:02:15.291,01:02:16.875,In five minutes!
01:02:27.000,01:02:28.791,Don't hesitate to call me.
01:02:44.333,01:02:46.500,"Nice to see you, Jared."
01:02:47.666,01:02:49.125,I'll take the footlong...
01:02:49.458,01:02:50.458,Fully loaded.
01:03:06.166,01:03:07.666,41 confirmed kills.
01:03:07.833,01:03:10.208,Now it's 89.
01:03:11.000,01:03:12.000,Mr. Wilson?
01:03:12.166,01:03:13.208,Ding-ding.
01:03:14.041,01:03:16.208,You're looking very alive.
01:03:16.416,01:03:18.083,Ha! Only on the outside!
01:03:18.750,01:03:20.208,"This is not going to end well for me, is it?"
01:03:20.333,01:03:21.541,"This is not gonna end well for you, no."
01:03:21.666,01:03:22.750,Where's your boss?
01:03:22.875,01:03:24.375,I can tell you exactly...
01:03:26.208,01:03:28.125,"Oh, you'll tell me."
01:03:28.666,01:03:30.875,You might wanna look away for this.
01:03:31.000,01:03:32.250,Now this little piggy went to...
01:03:34.375,01:03:36.708,"WADE: Thank you, Agent Smith."
01:03:40.375,01:03:41.375,Taxi!
01:03:42.875,01:03:45.125,Hop in! Great day for a ride.
01:03:47.083,01:03:48.458,WADE: And we all know how this turned out.
01:03:51.416,01:03:53.625,Whoops!
01:04:01.583,01:04:03.375,There. All caught up.
01:04:11.333,01:04:13.208,We're here.
01:04:13.833,01:04:17.208,bleeding in all your garbage.
01:04:23.583,01:04:25.625,Seltzer water and lemon for blood.
01:04:26.083,01:04:27.083,Whoo!
01:04:27.791,01:04:30.291,Some kinds of anger can't be managed...
01:04:30.416,01:04:35.458,like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
01:04:36.125,01:04:40.625,"That said, when it comes time to licking wounds, there's no place like home."
01:04:41.291,01:04:45.708,"Ah, and I share that home with someone you've met, the old blind lady from the laundromat, Al."
01:04:46.083,01:04:47.625,"God, I miss cocaine."
01:04:47.958,01:04:48.958,Her.
01:04:49.125,01:04:52.708,inside a fourth-wall break.
01:04:52.916,01:04:55.458,That's like 16 walls.
01:04:56.041,01:05:01.375,"She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old, and black, and blind."
01:05:01.625,01:05:03.208,And I think she's in love with me.
01:05:03.666,01:05:07.041,"WADE: Wait, pretty sure Robin loves Batman, too."
01:05:17.041,01:05:18.041,WADE: Al?
01:05:20.458,01:05:21.708,"Morning, sleepyhead."
01:05:23.333,01:05:25.375,It smells like old lady pants in here.
01:05:25.541,01:05:27.291,"Yes, I'm old."
01:05:27.500,01:05:29.083,But you're no lady.
01:05:29.333,01:05:31.916,Oh! So comfy.
01:05:32.666,01:05:35.583,Upside of being blind: I've never seen you in Crocs.
01:05:35.750,01:05:37.041,"You mean my big, rubber masturbating shoes?"
01:05:37.166,01:05:38.250,"AL: Yes, I know."
01:05:38.791,01:05:41.333,Downside of being blind...
01:05:41.541,01:05:43.750,I hear everything in this duplex.
01:05:46.083,01:05:47.166,Sit on a stick.
01:05:47.375,01:05:48.291,Bactin?
01:05:48.416,01:05:52.500,Yeah. Bactin should do it.
01:05:53.666,01:05:55.291,How's that Kullen coming along?
01:05:55.416,01:05:57.375,"IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know."
01:05:57.541,01:06:00.375,You're telling me.
01:06:00.541,01:06:02.416,It's an improvement on the Hurdal.
01:06:03.083,01:06:05.583,Please. Anything's an improvement over the Hurdal.
01:06:05.750,01:06:09.208,I'd have taken an Hemnes or a Trysil over the Hurdal.
01:06:09.833,01:06:12.541,"Oh, no, I didn't get excited till I saw the Kullen."
01:06:12.666,01:06:13.708,"Screw, please."
01:06:13.875,01:06:15.166,Here? Now?
01:06:15.333,01:06:16.416,I know it's been decades.
01:06:16.541,01:06:17.666,You'd be surprised.
01:06:18.375,01:06:19.500,Pretty grossed out.
01:06:29.750,01:06:32.875,I wish I never heard of Craigslist.
01:06:33.291,01:06:35.833,"And I quote, Looking for roommate, blind to life's imperfections."
01:06:35.958,01:06:37.000,Must be good with hands.
01:06:37.125,01:06:39.291,"Or would you rather I build the IKEA, and you pay rent?"
01:06:39.416,01:06:41.291,Why such a douche this morning?
01:06:42.083,01:06:43.125,Let's recap.
01:06:43.250,01:06:45.416,The cock thistle that turned me into this freak...
01:06:45.583,01:06:47.250,slipped through my arms today...
01:06:48.916,01:06:50.041,Arm.
01:06:50.500,01:06:53.583,"Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back..."
01:06:53.708,01:06:55.916,and prevent this shit from happening to someone else.
01:06:56.041,01:06:59.750,"So, yeah, today was about as much fun as a sandpaper dildo."
01:07:01.708,01:07:03.208,#driveby.
01:07:20.791,01:07:22.750,Found out who our friend in the red suit is.
01:07:25.125,01:07:26.958,Fucking Wade Wilson.
01:07:27.958,01:07:30.291,I suppose I'd wear a mask too if I had a face like that.
01:07:30.916,01:07:32.416,I only wish I healed the same.
01:07:36.416,01:07:39.083,"Still, we'll put him out of our misery."
01:07:39.250,01:07:40.458,On our terms.
01:07:40.875,01:07:42.625,Right.
01:07:43.625,01:07:44.625,He can't.
01:07:44.875,01:07:47.333,Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
01:07:47.458,01:07:51.458,"You know, it's funny."
01:07:52.916,01:07:54.333,I like a challenge.
01:07:55.708,01:07:57.708,But he's bad for business.
01:07:57.875,01:07:59.583,Now let's go find him.
01:08:00.500,01:08:01.500,Oh.
01:08:04.041,01:08:05.375,Tylenol PM?
01:08:05.541,01:08:08.041,You can stick that where you stuck the Bactin.
01:08:08.416,01:08:10.708,I raided my stash of wisdom tooth Percocet...
01:08:10.875,01:08:14.833,and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
01:08:17.666,01:08:19.708,But I appreciate the gesture.
01:08:20.625,01:08:24.958,"Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?"
01:08:25.125,01:08:26.875,About the size of a KFC spork.
01:08:27.166,01:08:28.166,Ugh.
01:08:29.083,01:08:31.250,I get why you're so pissy...
01:08:31.416,01:08:34.250,but your mood's never gonna brighten till you find this woman...
01:08:34.416,01:08:35.708,and tell her how you feel.
01:08:35.875,01:08:37.375,"What do I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo?"
01:08:37.500,01:08:39.083,She wouldn't have me.
01:08:39.291,01:08:40.916,"If you could see me, you'd understand."
01:08:41.083,01:08:42.083,Looks aren't everything.
01:08:42.250,01:08:43.250,Looks are everything.
01:08:43.416,01:08:45.375,You ever heard David Beckham speak?
01:08:45.541,01:08:47.583,It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium.
01:08:47.958,01:08:51.083,You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?
01:08:51.250,01:08:52.458,"Love is blind, Wade."
01:08:52.583,01:08:53.583,No.
01:08:54.666,01:08:55.916,You're blind.
01:08:56.583,01:08:59.375,"So, you're just gonna lie there and whimper?"
01:08:59.541,01:09:01.541,"No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty..."
01:09:01.666,01:09:03.750,and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan.
01:09:04.583,01:09:07.250,"In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room."
01:09:07.916,01:09:10.375,I bet it feels huge in this hand.
01:09:11.791,01:09:14.458,"Go, go, go."
01:09:15.000,01:09:17.875,"WEASEL: So, the doctor says, The bad news is you don't have that long to live."
01:09:18.000,01:09:19.500,"So, the patient says, How long do I have?"
01:09:19.625,01:09:21.458,"The doctor says, Five."
01:09:21.583,01:09:23.125,"The guy says, Five what?"
01:09:23.250,01:09:26.375,"And the doctor says, Four, three, two..."
01:09:34.291,01:09:35.833,Can I help you ladies?
01:09:38.416,01:09:39.541,"Oh, I do hope so."
01:09:43.750,01:09:47.875,"I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a, um, friend of mine."
01:09:48.416,01:09:49.416,Name of Wade Wilson.
01:09:50.958,01:09:52.000,Sorry.
01:09:52.166,01:09:53.791,I don't know the name.
01:10:01.125,01:10:03.458,"Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar."
01:10:07.166,01:10:08.958,I've seen this girl.
01:10:09.125,01:10:10.375,"FRANCIS: Ah, this must be Vanessa."
01:10:10.500,01:10:11.666,I've heard so much about you.
01:10:16.000,01:10:18.083,"Um, sweetheart, you might wanna look around."
01:10:18.666,01:10:21.291,This isn't really the place to do something like that.
01:10:22.666,01:10:24.291,"Easy, Angel."
01:10:24.458,01:10:25.833,Put the little man down.
01:10:27.416,01:10:29.166,We have everything we need now.
01:10:29.583,01:10:30.625,You sure?
01:10:31.333,01:10:34.375,You don't want any clothes that are not monochromatic?
01:10:34.541,01:10:37.208,Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade II.
01:10:39.375,01:10:40.416,Whoo.
01:10:40.875,01:10:42.583,"Thanks for having my back, guys."
01:10:47.583,01:10:49.916,"Wade, we have a fucking problem."
01:10:50.041,01:10:51.875,"And by we, I mean you."
01:10:52.750,01:10:54.416,"Ah, I can't believe I'm doing this."
01:10:54.916,01:10:57.666,"Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?"
01:10:57.833,01:10:59.833,"Yeah, afrangry, I guess."
01:11:00.000,01:11:01.666,Have you decided what you're gonna say to her?
01:11:01.833,01:11:02.833,Fuck me!
01:11:03.166,01:11:05.041,"Uh, maybe not start with that."
01:11:10.958,01:11:14.125,"Hey, coming onto our stage right now..."
01:11:14.291,01:11:16.500,give it up for Chastity!
01:11:20.375,01:11:22.583,"Or as I like to call her, Irony."
01:11:22.750,01:11:24.750,Better find her fast before numbnuts does.
01:11:24.916,01:11:26.291,How do you know she's in here?
01:11:26.458,01:11:29.583,Because I'm constantly stalking that fox.
01:11:54.541,01:11:58.125,"WADE: Every time I see her, it's like the first time..."
01:11:58.958,01:12:01.125,Especially from this angle.
01:12:24.541,01:12:28.583,"ANNOUNCER: You can't buy love, but you can rent it for three minutes."
01:12:31.583,01:12:34.250,"Ah, you weak motherfucker!"
01:12:35.041,01:12:36.041,Come on!
01:12:37.250,01:12:38.458,"Come on, get it together."
01:12:38.625,01:12:40.666,"This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa."
01:12:44.791,01:12:46.125,Here we go.
01:12:48.708,01:12:50.333,Maximum effort.
01:12:53.833,01:12:54.958,Vanessa.
01:12:57.500,01:12:59.375,Someone out back asking for you.
01:12:59.500,01:13:01.625,"Something about, uh, an old boyfriend."
01:13:29.000,01:13:30.083,I knew it was you.
01:13:31.916,01:13:33.875,"The weird, curvy edges."
01:13:35.416,01:13:37.250,Like a jigsaw puzzle.
01:13:47.291,01:13:49.166,You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
01:13:58.166,01:13:59.666,Hey. Hey! Where'd she go?
01:13:59.833,01:14:01.666,"Uh, I saw her head to the back."
01:14:01.791,01:14:03.250,"Go get her, tiger."
01:14:31.208,01:14:32.833,Motherfucker!
01:14:33.000,01:14:34.041,"Wait, wait."
01:14:34.166,01:14:35.083,Cock juggling...
01:14:35.208,01:14:36.208,We can talk about what we're gonna...
01:14:36.333,01:14:37.250,Jiminy! Fuck face!
01:14:37.375,01:14:38.541,"Okay, or you can hit that."
01:14:38.666,01:14:40.416,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:14:40.541,01:14:41.875,"No, no."
01:14:42.000,01:14:43.208,Fuck! Fuck!
01:14:43.750,01:14:44.791,Fuck!
01:14:45.458,01:14:47.791,Whoa! Whoa!
01:14:47.958,01:14:49.208,Okay. I think that's a good start.
01:14:49.333,01:14:51.291,"Oh, I'm gonna rip his motherfucking..."
01:14:51.416,01:14:52.375,Wait.
01:14:52.500,01:14:53.958,Find it! Find it.
01:14:54.083,01:14:55.458,I'm gonna get angry.
01:14:55.916,01:14:57.583,All right. Okay. All right.
01:14:57.750,01:14:58.958,Here. This is Vanessa.
01:14:59.125,01:15:01.000,What?
01:15:01.166,01:15:02.958,He wants you to come to him.
01:15:03.916,01:15:05.500,What is that?
01:15:05.625,01:15:07.666,"You know, it's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes?"
01:15:07.791,01:15:10.083,I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
01:15:10.791,01:15:11.916,I need guns.
01:15:12.083,01:15:13.083,"Okay, which ones?"
01:15:13.250,01:15:14.291,I need all the guns!
01:15:14.416,01:15:15.625,All right. Okay.
01:15:36.375,01:15:37.833,"That's about 3,000 rounds."
01:15:38.833,01:15:40.833,We all know what I can do with 12.
01:15:41.291,01:15:43.375,"Hey, hey, careful with that, Ronnie Milsap!"
01:15:43.500,01:15:44.625,We're downrange.
01:15:46.041,01:15:49.625,"I was gonna spend the night assembling the Borje, but this is holding my interest."
01:15:50.791,01:15:53.500,"I told you, we're going with the Urvaj, not the Borje."
01:15:53.625,01:15:55.500,Get it through your head or get out of fuck town.
01:15:55.625,01:15:58.291,Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.
01:15:58.458,01:16:00.250,"Nah, nah... Come on."
01:16:00.625,01:16:02.125,"Up, up, up."
01:16:03.250,01:16:04.500,"Oh. Down, down, down."
01:16:04.666,01:16:05.666,Fuck you.
01:16:07.541,01:16:10.375,.45 cal. I like it.
01:16:12.500,01:16:13.708,Wade...
01:16:14.916,01:16:17.666,"I'd go with you, but I don't want to."
01:16:20.833,01:16:21.833,Uh...
01:16:22.208,01:16:23.375,"Listen, Al..."
01:16:24.416,01:16:29.583,"if I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much."
01:16:30.541,01:16:35.541,"And also, uh, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment..."
01:16:35.666,01:16:38.458,right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.
01:16:43.958,01:16:45.208,You wanna get fucked up?
01:16:55.416,01:16:56.916,Put her down over here.
01:17:07.083,01:17:08.291,Go on then.
01:17:10.750,01:17:13.291,"Thanks, dickless."
01:17:13.750,01:17:16.916,Wow. You're a talker too.
01:17:17.083,01:17:20.250,"I've been trying to tell you assholes, you've got the wrong girl."
01:17:20.375,01:17:21.833,"My old boyfriend, he's dead."
01:17:22.000,01:17:25.416,"See, I thought that too."
01:17:25.708,01:17:26.875,Like a cockroach...
01:17:27.041,01:17:28.375,but uglier.
01:17:29.375,01:17:32.958,"Now, I may not feel, but he does."
01:17:34.000,01:17:35.916,Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.
01:17:44.833,01:17:46.333,"Ripley, from Alien 3!"
01:17:46.958,01:17:48.791,"Fuck, you're old."
01:17:50.458,01:17:52.666,Fake laugh.
01:17:52.791,01:17:54.083,Go get Silver Balls.
01:17:54.208,01:17:56.500,You guys going for a bite?
01:17:56.625,01:17:59.125,"Oh, like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money."
01:17:59.583,01:18:02.916,"No, you know that bad guy that you let go?"
01:18:03.541,01:18:05.291,He's got my girl.
01:18:05.458,01:18:06.875,You're gonna help me get her back.
01:18:07.250,01:18:08.958,"COLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?"
01:18:09.125,01:18:13.625,"Yeah, it's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse."
01:18:16.333,01:18:17.333,"I'm gonna wait out here, okay?"
01:18:17.458,01:18:18.375,It's a big house.
01:18:18.500,01:18:19.583,It's funny that I only ever see two of you.
01:18:19.708,01:18:22.958,It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
01:18:26.500,01:18:27.916,"WADE: And that is why, in my opinion..."
01:18:28.041,01:18:31.208,the movie Cocoon is pure pornography.
01:18:31.708,01:18:33.375,Who brought this twinkly man?
01:18:33.541,01:18:35.500,"Twinkly, but deadly."
01:18:35.666,01:18:39.666,My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid.
01:18:40.250,01:18:44.125,"In exchange, I said that I would consider joining his boy band."
01:18:44.291,01:18:45.458,It's not boy band.
01:18:45.625,01:18:46.666,Sure it's not.
01:18:47.416,01:18:49.666,any luck winning Gita back?
01:18:50.458,01:18:52.791,"I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool..."
01:18:52.958,01:18:56.666,but Bandhu is more craftier and handsomer than me.
01:18:57.333,01:18:59.041,"Well, I think you're pretty darn cute."
01:19:04.916,01:19:06.541,Dopinder.
01:19:07.875,01:19:08.875,What was that?
01:19:09.666,01:19:10.791,Uh...
01:19:10.916,01:19:16.541,That was Bandhu in the trunk.
01:19:17.208,01:19:18.416,Ban who?
01:19:18.541,01:19:21.208,My romantic rival Bandhu.
01:19:21.333,01:19:22.916,"I'm doing as you said, DP."
01:19:23.041,01:19:26.833,"I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish, then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep."
01:19:28.166,01:19:29.750,I did not tell him to do that.
01:19:29.875,01:19:32.500,Absolutely not.
01:19:32.625,01:19:35.791,"Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back!"
01:19:35.916,01:19:36.916,I'm so proud of you.
01:19:37.041,01:19:39.166,"Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like."
01:19:40.375,01:19:42.375,"And then, win Gita back..."
01:19:42.583,01:19:45.250,the old fashioned way: with your boyish charm.
01:19:48.291,01:19:49.458,He's super dead.
01:19:49.958,01:19:50.958,Whoa!
01:19:54.916,01:19:56.416,I presume a crisp high five?
01:19:56.583,01:19:57.916,For you? 10.
01:19:59.416,01:20:02.041,"Okay, guys, let's get out there and make a difference."
01:20:02.208,01:20:04.083,You know what to do.
01:20:05.041,01:20:07.666,"Knock 'em dead, Pool Boy!"
01:20:08.875,01:20:10.875,Time to make the chimi-fuckin'-changas.
01:20:12.375,01:20:13.916,WADE: Not often a dude ruins your face...
01:20:14.041,01:20:16.916,"skull-stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby mama..."
01:20:17.041,01:20:21.208,and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments.
01:20:21.333,01:20:25.500,Let's just say it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
01:20:38.458,01:20:39.708,NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD: Hey.
01:20:39.833,01:20:41.125,Where's your duffle bag?
01:21:00.000,01:21:01.375,DOPINDER: Bandhu?
01:21:02.958,01:21:04.875,DOPINDER: Leave a message and have a happy day.
01:21:05.041,01:21:06.333,God damn it!
01:21:06.500,01:21:08.041,I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way...
01:21:08.208,01:21:11.666,with two swords and maximum effort.
01:21:12.666,01:21:13.666,Cue the music.
01:21:29.791,01:21:32.250,FRANCIS: Wade Wilson!
01:21:32.791,01:21:34.333,What's my name?
01:21:34.458,01:21:36.625,"Oh, I'mma fuckin' spell it out for ya."
01:21:38.916,01:21:39.916,Go get some.
01:21:40.083,01:21:41.166,Superhero landing.
01:21:41.333,01:21:42.416,She's gonna do a superhero landing.
01:21:42.541,01:21:43.541,Wait for it.
01:21:46.875,01:21:47.875,WADE: Whoo!
01:21:48.000,01:21:49.166,Superhero landing!
01:21:49.708,01:21:50.750,"You know, that's really hard on your knees."
01:21:51.083,01:21:52.541,Totally impractical.
01:21:53.041,01:21:56.208,"You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis."
01:21:56.375,01:21:57.416,That's why I brought him.
01:21:57.583,01:22:00.833,"I prefer not to hit a woman, so please..."
01:22:08.000,01:22:11.041,"I mean, that's why I brought her?"
01:22:12.625,01:22:14.666,"Oh, no, finish your tweet."
01:22:14.833,01:22:16.291,Just give us a second.
01:22:16.458,01:22:17.791,There you go.
01:22:19.166,01:22:21.000,"Go get her, tiger."
01:22:27.750,01:22:31.458,"Oh, I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex."
01:22:32.208,01:22:33.750,"All right, then. Fire!"
01:22:45.458,01:22:46.958,Finish fucking her the fuck up!
01:22:47.125,01:22:48.125,"Language, please."
01:22:48.250,01:22:49.375,Suck a cock.
01:23:15.458,01:23:17.125,"Look away, child."
01:23:17.833,01:23:19.166,Look away!
01:23:26.500,01:23:27.750,WADE: Wait!
01:23:27.916,01:23:28.958,Wait!
01:23:29.083,01:23:30.000,Cease fire!
01:23:30.125,01:23:31.291,Cease fire!
01:23:31.458,01:23:32.916,WADE: Fellas! Hey! Hey!
01:23:34.291,01:23:37.916,You only work for that shit-spackled muppet fart.
01:23:38.083,01:23:41.958,"So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms..."
01:23:42.125,01:23:45.041,"in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle..."
01:23:45.208,01:23:48.708,possibly even lover-like treatment.
01:23:50.791,01:23:51.875,Fine.
01:23:52.000,01:23:53.041,Commando!
01:25:05.041,01:25:06.125,Teabag!
01:25:10.750,01:25:11.750,Bob?
01:25:12.750,01:25:13.666,Wade?
01:25:13.791,01:25:15.000,"Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since..."
01:25:15.125,01:25:17.416,Jacksonville. Fridays.
01:25:18.250,01:25:19.958,"Well, what the hell!"
01:25:20.541,01:25:22.041,"God, come here, you."
01:25:24.208,01:25:26.125,How are the kids?
01:25:26.708,01:25:28.375,"And Gail, she still fixing that tuna casserole?"
01:25:28.500,01:25:30.166,So good.
01:25:28.500,01:25:31.416,"But bad for the waistline, if you know what I'm talking about."
01:25:38.083,01:25:41.333,Your... On the left.
01:25:41.500,01:25:42.541,That is so sweet.
01:25:42.833,01:25:43.833,Uh...
01:25:44.000,01:25:45.000,Thanks.
01:25:52.625,01:25:53.625,WADE: Yoo-hoo!
01:25:57.250,01:25:58.791,FRANCIS: Does he write you notes too?
01:25:58.916,01:26:00.791,He's such a romantic.
01:26:01.166,01:26:02.583,"WADE: Don't worry, baby."
01:26:03.916,01:26:04.958,Fire!
01:26:12.583,01:26:14.000,NEGASONIC TEENAGE WARHEAD: Hey!
01:26:14.291,01:26:15.291,Climb on!
01:26:52.333,01:26:53.875,Motherfucking...
01:27:05.166,01:27:07.666,Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants.
01:27:10.458,01:27:11.625,"You were right, beautiful."
01:27:12.500,01:27:14.250,Red really is my color.
01:27:15.000,01:27:16.083,Wade?
01:27:16.208,01:27:17.208,"Don't worry, baby..."
01:27:17.541,01:27:19.541,I'mma get you out of that shit-box.
01:27:20.041,01:27:22.166,What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours?
01:27:22.333,01:27:24.083,"Oh, you never left."
01:27:24.250,01:27:26.250,"But you did, asshole!"
01:27:26.416,01:27:27.875,"Ah, deep breath, darling."
01:27:29.416,01:27:30.541,"Oh, wait."
01:27:31.666,01:27:33.208,Wrong choice of words.
01:27:35.416,01:27:38.166,I hope they blocked pain to your every last nerve.
01:27:38.333,01:27:39.416,'Cause I'mma go lookin'!
01:27:40.791,01:27:42.833,"I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade."
01:27:43.333,01:27:44.333,When I'm finished...
01:27:44.458,01:27:46.166,parts will have to grow back you.
01:27:46.333,01:27:47.458,Good one.
01:27:48.375,01:27:50.125,"Yep, that was a good one."
01:27:50.291,01:27:51.291,Let's dance.
01:27:52.666,01:27:53.791,"And by dance, I mean..."
01:27:53.958,01:27:55.041,let's try to kill each other.
01:28:49.791,01:28:52.000,Fine. Fists.
01:28:52.291,01:28:54.125,"Oh, sounds like your last Saturday night."
01:30:16.041,01:30:18.083,Asshole!
01:31:14.375,01:31:15.375,"Hang in there, baby!"
01:31:15.875,01:31:17.875,Wade!
01:31:21.250,01:31:23.208,I got a plan.
01:31:33.958,01:31:35.083,Shit! Shit! Shit!
01:31:41.000,01:31:43.500,Don't worry.
01:31:58.625,01:32:00.583,Ah! Damn it!
01:32:01.458,01:32:04.375,Maximum effort!
01:32:46.750,01:32:47.750,Thanks.
01:32:52.833,01:32:54.416,Just take it slow.
01:33:01.125,01:33:02.500,WADE: Yoo-hoo!
01:33:04.875,01:33:07.458,"Oh, my God! That was so..."
01:33:38.583,01:33:40.125,There are no words!
01:33:41.208,01:33:44.791,Me and you are headed to fix this butterface.
01:33:45.583,01:33:46.708,What?
01:33:49.083,01:33:51.791,You stupid fucking idiot.
01:33:52.250,01:33:56.750,Did you really think there was a cure...
01:33:58.625,01:33:59.625,What?
01:34:00.083,01:34:01.125,You heard me.
01:34:02.916,01:34:04.000,No.
01:34:04.125,01:34:05.291,No!
01:34:12.666,01:34:15.666,"So, you mean to say..."
01:34:16.416,01:34:20.458,"after all this, you can't fix me?"
01:34:21.250,01:34:23.291,It sounds even stupider when you say it.
01:34:23.416,01:34:28.458,Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
01:34:32.375,01:34:34.125,Any last words?
01:34:36.000,01:34:37.083,What's my name?
01:34:38.166,01:34:39.208,Who fucking cares?
01:34:39.333,01:34:40.333,COLOSSUS: Wade!
01:34:41.958,01:34:44.333,Four or five moments.
01:34:44.791,01:34:45.750,I'm sorry?
01:34:45.875,01:34:48.291,"Four or five moments, that's all it takes."
01:34:48.916,01:34:49.916,To?
01:34:50.875,01:34:52.208,Be a hero.
01:34:54.416,01:34:57.166,Everyone thinks it's a full-time job.
01:34:57.291,01:35:00.875,"Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero, go to work a hero."
01:35:01.375,01:35:03.041,Not true.
01:35:03.250,01:35:08.625,"Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter."
01:35:09.041,01:35:11.416,Moments when you're offered a choice.
01:35:11.583,01:35:15.750,"To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend..."
01:35:16.375,01:35:19.000,spare an enemy.
01:35:19.541,01:35:20.916,In these moments...
01:35:21.708,01:35:24.583,everything else falls away.
01:35:25.208,01:35:27.750,The way the world sees us.
01:35:28.208,01:35:29.208,The way we...
01:35:33.458,01:35:34.541,Why?
01:35:35.750,01:35:37.708,You were droning on.
01:35:37.875,01:35:40.791,"Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread..."
01:35:40.958,01:35:43.750,but at least fuckface won't heal from that.
01:35:44.000,01:35:46.625,If wearing superhero tights...
01:35:47.083,01:35:48.416,means sparing psychopaths...
01:35:48.583,01:35:50.625,then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em.
01:35:50.791,01:35:53.083,Not everyone monitors a hall like you.
01:35:53.208,01:35:54.208,Just promise...
01:35:54.333,01:35:58.166,"Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments."
01:35:59.958,01:36:05.750,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy, about to stand in front of a girl..."
01:36:05.916,01:36:07.125,and tell her...
01:36:07.291,01:36:09.250,What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
01:36:09.375,01:36:12.625,"Well, hmm, you better figure it out."
01:36:14.125,01:36:15.333,I can't even tell you...
01:36:15.458,01:36:16.541,I deserved that.
01:36:17.333,01:36:18.958,"No, no, no, maybe not the nethers."
01:36:19.083,01:36:20.958,Start talking!
01:36:23.000,01:36:24.583,I'm sorry.
01:36:24.833,01:36:26.291,I'm so sorry.
01:36:27.125,01:36:29.666,I'm sorry for leaving...
01:36:31.166,01:36:33.125,I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner.
01:36:33.291,01:36:34.958,it's been rough couple of years.
01:36:35.083,01:36:36.083,Rough?
01:36:43.833,01:36:45.666,I live in a crackhouse.
01:36:46.916,01:36:48.250,With a family of 12.
01:36:50.000,01:36:51.458,Every night we spoon for warmth.
01:36:51.583,01:36:54.500,Everybody fights for Noelle.
01:36:54.666,01:36:56.250,There's nothing that we don't share.
01:36:56.375,01:37:00.625,"Floor space, dental floss, even condoms."
01:37:08.708,01:37:10.875,"So, you live in a house."
01:37:19.708,01:37:22.666,I should have come and found you sooner.
01:37:24.125,01:37:28.041,"But, baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one that you remember."
01:37:32.416,01:37:33.625,You mean this mask?
01:37:53.833,01:37:55.416,And this one.
01:37:56.875,01:37:58.666,In case the other fell off.
01:38:01.625,01:38:03.791,All right.
01:38:03.958,01:38:05.541,"Like a Band-Aid, just give it a..."
01:38:05.708,01:38:07.708,"Owdie 5,000."
01:38:07.833,01:38:08.916,"Wait, wait, wait..."
01:38:10.833,01:38:12.083,Are you sure?
01:38:13.958,01:38:14.958,I'm sure.
01:38:25.375,01:38:26.375,Wow.
01:38:27.750,01:38:28.875,Yeah.
01:38:35.791,01:38:37.125,Hey.
01:38:39.375,01:38:41.125,After a brief adjustment period...
01:38:41.666,01:38:43.583,and a bunch of drinks...
01:38:45.000,01:38:46.958,it's a face...
01:38:51.375,01:38:53.000,I'd be happy to sit on.
01:39:00.458,01:39:03.916,"I'm not the same underneath this suit, either."
01:39:04.041,01:39:05.083,No.
01:39:05.625,01:39:07.375,Super-penis.
01:39:07.625,01:39:09.500,"COLOSSUS: Come on, Wade. Language."
01:39:09.750,01:39:11.125,Young one is present.
01:39:12.208,01:39:14.000,What are you still doing?
01:39:14.125,01:39:16.750,Get out of here.
01:39:16.875,01:39:19.583,"You, go be a really big brother to someone."
01:39:19.708,01:39:21.375,Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
01:39:21.500,01:39:23.291,"And you, chicken noodle..."
01:39:23.458,01:39:25.208,Nothing compares to you.
01:39:25.333,01:39:27.333,"Sinead O'Connor, 1990."
01:39:27.458,01:39:30.083,That's all right.
01:39:32.041,01:39:33.625,What in the ass?
01:39:33.791,01:39:36.833,That was not mean.
01:39:37.250,01:39:40.291,"We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade."
01:39:40.458,01:39:43.500,"For a second there, it felt like we were three mini-lion robots..."
01:39:43.625,01:39:45.875,coming together to form one super robot.
01:39:46.791,01:39:47.916,There's a stupid.
01:39:48.041,01:39:49.083,Yeah.
01:39:52.541,01:39:56.916,"And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for."
01:40:00.666,01:40:01.791,Come here.
01:40:11.625,01:40:14.583,Wham! As promised.
01:40:27.666,01:40:28.791,WADE: See?
01:40:28.916,01:40:32.416,You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl.
01:40:32.541,01:40:35.291,The right girl will bring out the hero in you.
01:40:35.916,01:40:39.291,"Now, let's finish this epic wide shot. Pull out."
01:40:39.458,01:40:40.958,"There we go, that looks nice."
01:40:41.083,01:40:43.500,That's gonna be about the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
01:40:43.625,01:40:46.791,"Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh?"
01:40:46.916,01:40:50.666,"'Til next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy singin'..."
01:46:52.083,01:47:08.166,Captioned by Deluxe You're still here?
01:47:10.708,01:47:13.750,It's over. Go home.
01:47:15.458,01:47:17.916,"Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2."
01:47:18.041,01:47:19.875,"Well, we don't have that kind of money."
01:47:20.833,01:47:23.708,What are you expecting?
01:47:23.875,01:47:26.541,With an eye patch and a saucy little leather number?
01:47:26.666,01:47:28.291,Go. Go.
01:47:33.541,01:47:34.458,Oh.
01:47:34.583,01:47:37.083,"But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret."
01:47:37.208,01:47:40.291,"For the sequel, we're gonna have Cable."
01:47:40.416,01:47:42.750,Amazing character.
01:47:42.875,01:47:45.083,"We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet, but it could be anybody."
01:47:45.208,01:47:46.666,Just need a big guy with a flat top.
01:47:46.791,01:47:48.416,"Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren..."
01:47:48.541,01:47:50.916,Keira Knightley.
01:47:51.041,01:47:52.375,"Anyway, big secret. Shh..."
01:47:52.500,01:47:54.416,"Oh, and don't leave your garbage all lying around."
01:47:54.541,01:47:56.958,It's a total dick move.
01:47:57.916,01:47:59.000,Go.
