00:01:19.079,00:01:20.788,&lrm;...didn't work.
00:01:20.872,00:01:23.416,&lrm;And I'm already dead.
00:01:23.958,00:01:26.961,&lrm;-MAN 1: Evan? &lrm;-MAN 2: I think he's in here.
00:01:27.044,00:01:37.889,&lrm;But if I can somehow &lrm;go back to the beginning &lrm;to save her.
00:01:38.223,00:01:39.599,&lrm;MAN 2: Evan!
00:02:25.978,00:02:27.355,&lrm;Evan!
00:02:32.444,00:02:33.778,&lrm;We're gonna be late again.
00:02:34.654,00:02:37.031,&lrm;When did you ever care &lrm;about getting to school on time?
00:02:37.449,00:02:38.991,&lrm;We're putting up pictures &lrm;for parents' night.
00:02:39.826,00:02:41.911,"&lrm;Don't worry, you'll have plenty of time."
00:02:45.165,00:02:46.249,&lrm;Is Dad gonna come?
00:02:46.791,00:02:48.210,&lrm;You know the answer to that.
00:02:48.501,00:02:50.503,&lrm;Can't he just come out for one day?
00:02:50.837,00:02:53.881,&lrm;We've been over this a hundred times. &lrm;It's too dangerous for him.
00:02:54.716,00:03:00.222,"&lrm;But Lenny said his dad's coming, &lrm;-and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad... &lrm;-Okay, I get the point."
00:03:01.889,00:03:03.850,"&lrm;But I'm not so bad, am I?"
00:03:04.351,00:03:05.352,&lrm;No.
00:03:18.781,00:03:21.033,"&lrm;Okay, have a great day."
00:03:21.117,00:03:24.120,&lrm;I love you. &lrm;I'll pick you up later. Gotta go.
00:03:25.538,00:03:26.748,&lrm;Bye.
00:03:30.042,00:03:31.294,&lrm;Bye!
00:03:34.714,00:03:36.383,"&lrm;Mrs. Treborn, I need to speak with you."
00:03:36.466,00:03:38.801,&lrm;Can it wait till tonight? &lrm;I'm already late for work and I...
00:03:38.885,00:03:41.053,&lrm;I think you really need to see this.
00:03:43.265,00:03:45.308,"&lrm;Tommy, leave Lenny alone."
00:03:45.392,00:03:48.478,&lrm;Don't make me send you &lrm;to Mr. Voytek's office.
00:03:49.312,00:03:52.899,"&lrm;I was gonna show this to the principal, &lrm;but I thought I should talk to you first."
00:03:52.982,00:03:54.025,&lrm;What is it?
00:03:54.108,00:03:58.070,"&lrm;Yesterday, I had all the children &lrm;make drawings &lrm;of what they wanted to be &lrm;when they grew up."
00:03:58.154,00:04:00.156,&lrm;Most of them made drawings &lrm;of what their parents did.
00:04:00.240,00:04:01.533,&lrm;But this...
00:04:12.084,00:04:13.336,&lrm;ANDREA: I don't understand.
00:04:14.421,00:04:15.880,&lrm;Evan did this?
00:04:18.550,00:04:20.843,"&lrm;-Can I keep this drawing? &lrm;-Oh, of course."
00:04:21.303,00:04:25.848,"&lrm;Um, there is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn, &lrm;-I feel bad even mentioning. &lrm;-What?"
00:04:26.641,00:04:31.771,"&lrm;When I asked Evan about the drawing, &lrm;well, he couldn't remember doing it."
00:04:40.947,00:04:42.740,&lrm;EVAN: I don't wanna go.
00:04:44.284,00:04:46.369,"&lrm;I don't like this place, Mom."
00:04:46.453,00:04:47.954,&lrm;I think it's creepy.
00:04:49.706,00:04:52.584,&lrm;I promise I won't make any bad pictures. &lrm;I promise.
00:04:52.667,00:04:54.461,"&lrm;You're gonna be fine, okay?"
00:04:54.544,00:04:56.963,"&lrm;He just wants to do &lrm;a couple tests, that's all."
00:04:57.297,00:04:59.090,&lrm;-EVAN: Oh... &lrm;-You'll like him.
00:05:03.052,00:05:05.430,&lrm;WOMAN: That's good. You're doing great.
00:05:05.513,00:05:08.224,&lrm;ANDREA: Just tell me he hasn't inherited &lrm;his father's illness.
00:05:08.975,00:05:11.603,&lrm;I'm sure the test results &lrm;will come back negative.
00:05:11.686,00:05:13.813,&lrm;But there's something else you can do &lrm;to monitor his memory.
00:05:14.439,00:05:16.691,&lrm;-Anything. &lrm;-A journal.
00:05:16.774,00:05:18.776,&lrm;Just have him write down &lrm;everything that he does.
00:05:18.860,00:05:21.738,&lrm;-And what will that do? &lrm;-It could help jog his memory.
00:05:22.196,00:05:25.241,&lrm;See if he remembers &lrm;anything new the next day.
00:05:25.325,00:05:29.286,"&lrm;These test results &lrm;will come back in a few days, &lrm;-and we'll take it from there. &lrm;-Okay."
00:05:30.162,00:05:32.749,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Today Mommy is taking me &lrm;to play with Kayleigh and Tommy.
00:05:34.166,00:05:37.420,&lrm;I will meet their father &lrm;and see what a real dad is like.
00:05:40.214,00:05:41.841,"&lrm;Great, see you soon."
00:05:54.270,00:05:55.772,&lrm;Evan...
00:05:55.855,00:05:58.858,"&lrm;Evan, what are you doing with that knife?"
00:06:07.534,00:06:08.535,&lrm;What happened?
00:06:09.452,00:06:10.662,&lrm;Honey...
00:06:12.121,00:06:13.831,&lrm;What were you doing with that knife?
00:06:16.501,00:06:17.835,&lrm;I don't remember.
00:06:29.514,00:06:31.098,"&lrm;-Hey, Andrea. &lrm;-George."
00:06:32.058,00:06:33.392,"&lrm;Hello, little man."
00:06:34.769,00:06:36.103,&lrm;Watch your step.
00:06:40.733,00:06:42.151,"&lrm;Uh, thanks, George."
00:06:42.234,00:06:46.656,"&lrm;-Not a problem. &lrm;-Here's my number at the hospital, &lrm;in case there are any problems."
00:06:46.739,00:06:49.534,"&lrm;And, uh, please keep &lrm;an eye on him 'cause..."
00:06:49.617,00:06:50.993,"&lrm;What, are you kidding?"
00:06:51.077,00:06:52.829,"&lrm;We're going to have &lrm;a great time today, right, sport?"
00:06:53.455,00:06:56.916,"&lrm;Okay, be good, kiddo. I love you."
00:06:56.999,00:06:58.626,"&lrm;-Bye-bye. &lrm;-Bye, George."
00:07:00.086,00:07:03.506,&lrm;Go long. Go on. &lrm;Right in the back yard. Here it comes.
00:07:06.551,00:07:10.597,"&lrm;Evan, Evan, guess what? &lrm;Dad got a new video camera &lrm;and we're all going to be in a movie."
00:07:10.680,00:07:12.474,"&lrm;That's right, Evan."
00:07:13.099,00:07:15.935,&lrm;And you get to be the star.
00:07:16.018,00:07:19.230,"&lrm;-I thought I was the star. &lrm;-Hey, what did I tell you?"
00:07:21.148,00:07:22.900,"&lrm;Now, Evan..."
00:07:22.984,00:07:32.159,"&lrm;You have to promise &lrm;your bestest, super-duper promise, &lrm;that this will be our little secret."
00:07:32.243,00:07:34.120,&lrm;-You think you can do that? &lrm;-Uh-huh.
00:07:43.420,00:07:44.922,&lrm;Where am I?
00:07:45.006,00:07:46.423,&lrm;Where did we all go?
00:07:46.508,00:07:47.925,"&lrm;Calm down, kid, stand still."
00:07:48.009,00:07:49.719,&lrm;EVAN: I was just somewhere else.
00:07:50.720,00:07:51.846,&lrm;How did I get here?
00:07:55.307,00:07:57.434,&lrm;and tell her what a naughty little shit &lrm;you've been.
00:08:00.647,00:08:01.689,&lrm;Kayleigh.
00:08:02.482,00:08:03.608,&lrm;Kayleigh.
00:08:04.901,00:08:06.443,&lrm;What happened?
00:08:16.496,00:08:19.248,&lrm;The good news is the results are negative.
00:08:19.331,00:08:22.459,"&lrm;I found no evidence of lesions, &lrm;hemorrhaging, tumors."
00:08:22.544,00:08:24.336,&lrm;But you must have something you can go on.
00:08:24.962,00:08:27.882,"&lrm;If I was to guess, &lrm;I'd say the blackouts are stress related."
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.384,&lrm;But he's seven years old.
00:08:30.467,00:08:33.012,&lrm;What kind of stress &lrm;can a seven-year-old have?
00:08:33.095,00:08:36.974,&lrm;Plenty. Maybe he has &lrm;severe coping problems &lrm;about not having a father.
00:08:37.975,00:08:41.688,&lrm;You said the last time &lrm;the blackouts occurred &lrm;he was visiting his friend's dad.
00:08:43.690,00:08:50.572,"&lrm;Well, he has been pushing me &lrm;to meet his father, &lrm;-and I've been putting it off. &lrm;-It's worth a shot, Andrea."
00:08:51.238,00:08:53.115,&lrm;We can arrange a controlled meeting.
00:08:53.199,00:09:02.458,"&lrm;A careful dose of sedatives &lrm;for Jason, some security, &lrm;Evan comes in for a quick visit, &lrm;and with a little luck, &lrm;no more missing father complex."
00:09:06.838,00:09:08.881,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;April 15th.
00:09:08.965,00:09:11.133,&lrm;Today I get to meet my father.
00:09:11.217,00:09:14.136,&lrm;His name is Jason and he's crazy.
00:09:14.220,00:09:16.180,&lrm;I hope he lets me call him Dad.
00:09:19.350,00:09:20.810,"&lrm;You mean, Dad lives here?"
00:09:20.893,00:09:23.020,"&lrm;Not in this wing, actually, no."
00:09:23.980,00:09:27.984,"&lrm;Now if your dad seems a little sleepy, &lrm;it's because of the medicine, okay?"
00:09:28.067,00:09:29.068,&lrm;Okay.
00:09:31.863,00:09:33.656,"&lrm;It'll just be a moment, okay?"
00:10:05.021,00:10:07.106,&lrm;It's okay. I won't bite.
00:10:08.816,00:10:10.943,"&lrm;-You've seen pictures of me, right? &lrm;-Uh-huh."
00:10:11.736,00:10:16.407,&lrm;Mom says I have your smile &lrm;and your hair.
00:10:17.283,00:10:21.245,&lrm;I love &lrm;-you! &lrm;-No!
00:10:22.789,00:10:25.166,&lrm;He has to die! It's the only way!
00:10:31.505,00:10:32.632,&lrm;It's gonna be okay.
00:10:32.715,00:10:34.050,&lrm;It's gonna be all right. &lrm;It's gonna be all right.
00:10:34.133,00:10:36.343,"&lrm;MAN 1: Yeah, man, he's hurt bad. &lrm;Get a stretcher."
00:10:38.345,00:10:39.639,"&lrm;MAN 2: Come on, let's get him out of here."
00:10:39.722,00:10:41.057,&lrm;ANDREA: I'm so sorry.
00:10:41.140,00:10:48.147,"&lrm;PRIEST: In sure and certain hope &lrm;of the resurrection to eternal life, &lrm;we commend to Almighty God, &lrm;our brother Jason."
00:10:48.856,00:10:58.825,"&lrm;The Lord bless him and keep him, &lrm;the Lord make his face to shine upon him, &lrm;and be gracious unto him &lrm;and give him peace. Amen."
00:11:37.696,00:11:41.533,"&lrm;TOMMY: Come on, where is it? &lrm;Damn, I know it's down here somewhere."
00:11:41.617,00:11:43.953,"&lrm;Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. &lrm;What's up already?"
00:11:44.036,00:11:45.496,"&lrm;LENNY: Yeah, what are you &lrm;looking for, anyway?"
00:11:45.579,00:11:48.750,"&lrm;Shut up, lard ass. &lrm;And you, hold your fucking horses."
00:11:49.500,00:11:51.210,"&lrm;You know, it's here somewhere."
00:11:51.961,00:11:53.545,&lrm;We should go soon.
00:11:54.421,00:11:56.548,"&lrm;If Dad catches us smoking down here, &lrm;we're dead."
00:11:56.966,00:11:58.050,"&lrm;EVAN: So, let's go."
00:12:01.387,00:12:03.973,&lrm;I knew Dad had a blockbuster down here!
00:12:04.056,00:12:05.767,&lrm;Let's blow the shit out of something.
00:12:16.027,00:12:17.569,"&lrm;Here you go, buddy."
00:12:18.404,00:12:19.446,"&lrm;What? No friggin' way, man."
00:12:19.530,00:12:22.449,&lrm;-I'm not touching this thing. &lrm;-The hell you aren't.
00:12:22.533,00:12:24.701,&lrm;Any of us does it and you're gonna &lrm;puss out and narc for sure.
00:12:24.786,00:12:27.789,"&lrm;Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. &lrm;Look how small this fuse is."
00:12:27.872,00:12:30.082,&lrm;-I'll get killed. &lrm;-EVAN: Not necessarily.
00:12:34.336,00:12:35.671,&lrm;There you go.
00:12:35.754,00:12:37.756,&lrm;It should buy you two minutes at least.
00:12:38.757,00:12:40.092,"&lrm;Gee, thanks, friend."
00:12:49.435,00:12:51.979,"&lrm;Aw, for Christ's sake, Lenny, you moron, &lrm;just do it."
00:13:03.908,00:13:06.743,"&lrm;-Thanks. &lrm;-You got balls, man."
00:13:07.536,00:13:08.745,&lrm;Shit took you long enough.
00:13:36.983,00:13:38.234,&lrm;What the hell? Come on!
00:13:38.985,00:13:40.862,"&lrm;Evan, come on. Help me get him up!"
00:13:40.945,00:13:43.280,"&lrm;Evan, get your ass back here &lrm;and help me get him up."
00:13:43.364,00:13:44.823,&lrm;What the hell happened? Where are we?
00:13:44.907,00:13:47.034,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Oh, my God. What did we do?"
00:13:47.118,00:13:48.870,"&lrm;TOMMY: Evan, come on. Help me."
00:13:50.246,00:13:51.663,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Oh, my God, how could we?"
00:13:51.747,00:13:54.000,"&lrm;-Come on, let's go! &lrm;-Shit, Lenny, what happened to you?"
00:13:54.541,00:13:56.002,&lrm;TOMMY: He's fine. He's gonna be okay.
00:13:56.085,00:13:57.461,&lrm;Everything's gonna be fine.
00:13:58.712,00:14:00.381,&lrm;MRS. KAGAN: What's wrong with him? &lrm;Why isn't he speaking?
00:14:06.512,00:14:08.097,&lrm;ANDREA: What is it? What happened?
00:14:08.639,00:14:11.558,&lrm;We were just in the woods building a fort &lrm;when Lenny freaked out.
00:14:11.642,00:14:14.811,"&lrm;One minute he was okay, &lrm;and then he just froze up. Right, guys?"
00:14:17.689,00:14:19.942,&lrm;I don't know. I don't remember.
00:14:20.026,00:14:22.528,&lrm;Something must have happened. &lrm;Something set him off.
00:14:23.487,00:14:24.655,&lrm;I blacked it out.
00:14:25.656,00:14:27.783,&lrm;Don't try to use your blackouts &lrm;to get out of this one.
00:14:34.706,00:14:36.083,&lrm;You're not making it up?
00:14:43.840,00:14:46.969,&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: Breathe in and breathe out.
00:14:47.053,00:14:48.762,&lrm;And relax.
00:14:49.471,00:14:52.141,&lrm;You are completely asleep.
00:14:52.224,00:14:53.725,&lrm;Relaxed.
00:14:54.977,00:14:58.230,&lrm;I want you to take me to the time &lrm;you were in the woods with Lenny.
00:14:59.523,00:15:01.817,&lrm;Think of it like a movie.
00:15:01.901,00:15:07.489,"&lrm;You can pause, rewind, &lrm;or slow down any details you wish."
00:15:08.574,00:15:10.159,&lrm;Understand?
00:15:11.118,00:15:12.786,&lrm;Yes.
00:15:13.412,00:15:14.914,&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: Where are you now?
00:15:17.124,00:15:18.500,&lrm;I'm standing next to Kayleigh.
00:15:18.584,00:15:21.170,&lrm;My hands are over her ears.
00:15:21.253,00:15:23.089,&lrm;Are you hurting her?
00:15:23.172,00:15:26.175,"&lrm;No, I'm protecting her."
00:15:26.258,00:15:30.471,&lrm;Okay. Now let's move forward in time.
00:15:30.554,00:15:32.181,&lrm;What do you see?
00:15:35.684,00:15:37.228,&lrm;I see a car.
00:15:45.277,00:15:47.196,&lrm;Nothing can hurt you.
00:15:48.990,00:15:52.576,"&lrm;Remember, it's only a movie. &lrm;You are completely safe."
00:15:53.494,00:15:55.662,&lrm;I can't...
00:15:55.746,00:15:59.125,&lrm;The car vanishes and all of a sudden &lrm;I'm on the ground in the woods.
00:15:59.625,00:16:01.168,"&lrm;The car doesn't vanish, Evan."
00:16:01.961,00:16:04.213,"&lrm;The movie in your head is broken, &lrm;that's all."
00:16:04.296,00:16:06.340,&lrm;Now tell me about the car.
00:16:06.423,00:16:07.883,&lrm;I can't!
00:16:10.636,00:16:12.638,"&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: Fight it, Evan, hurry."
00:16:14.681,00:16:19.520,"&lrm;-ANDREA: Oh, my God! &lrm;-On the count of 10, &lrm;you're going to wake up &lrm;feeling refreshed..."
00:16:20.812,00:16:22.231,&lrm;...and remembering everything &lrm;that we talked about.
00:16:22.314,00:16:23.607,&lrm;What is happening to him? Make it stop!
00:16:23.690,00:16:25.359,"&lrm;-One, you're feeling awake. &lrm;-Come on. Wake up."
00:16:25.442,00:16:27.486,"&lrm;Two, your eyes are not feeling as heavy."
00:16:27.569,00:16:28.904,"&lrm;-Five, six. &lrm;-Wake up!"
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.907,"&lrm;-Come on, Evan, wake up! Nine, 10. &lrm;-ANDREA: Wake him up!"
00:16:33.825,00:16:35.202,"&lrm;Oh, God."
00:16:39.248,00:16:40.332,&lrm;What happened?
00:16:41.125,00:16:42.126,&lrm;Did it work?
00:16:49.925,00:16:52.344,"&lrm;EVAN: All right, thanks, Mom. &lrm;See you later."
00:17:00.977,00:17:04.356,&lrm;Wipe that sad-ass look off your face &lrm;before you get us busted.
00:17:04.440,00:17:06.942,&lrm;Did you see the way &lrm;Evan's mom was looking at you?
00:17:07.026,00:17:08.319,&lrm;Sorry.
00:17:12.531,00:17:16.243,"&lrm;All right, will someone tell me already &lrm;what the hell happened with the mailbox?"
00:17:19.038,00:17:20.872,&lrm;Don't you ever bring that shit up again.
00:17:21.582,00:17:23.042,&lrm;Not ever!
00:17:29.215,00:17:30.716,&lrm;Let's go.
00:17:34.136,00:17:35.471,&lrm;Are you okay?
00:17:49.901,00:17:51.362,&lrm;Holy shit!
00:17:51.445,00:17:53.364,&lrm;Look at that fat fuck!
00:17:53.447,00:17:55.574,&lrm;He's got bigger titties than Lenny's mom.
00:17:55.782,00:17:56.783,&lrm;Shh!
00:17:56.908,00:17:58.577,"&lrm;Shut up, faggot."
00:17:58.660,00:17:59.828,&lrm;No one's talking to you.
00:18:24.978,00:18:27.356,"&lrm;I'm sorry, Kayleigh, this was a bad idea."
00:18:28.107,00:18:30.276,&lrm;You really don't remember &lrm;anything that happened?
00:18:32.611,00:18:34.029,&lrm;You're so lucky.
00:18:34.113,00:18:35.864,"&lrm;Look, everything's gonna be okay."
00:18:35.947,00:18:37.824,&lrm;Lenny'll be fine. You'll see.
00:18:40.536,00:18:41.995,&lrm;Sorry.
00:18:42.078,00:18:46.375,&lrm;It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called Dad &lrm;and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
00:18:47.251,00:18:48.502,&lrm;Your dad did that?
00:18:49.378,00:18:52.381,&lrm;-I deserve a lot worse. &lrm;-What are you talking about?
00:18:52.464,00:18:54.383,&lrm;What you deserve is &lrm;a better father and brother.
00:18:54.466,00:18:56.885,&lrm;All they do is make you feel like shit.
00:19:00.556,00:19:02.849,"&lrm;You really have no clue &lrm;how beautiful you are, do you?"
00:19:14.069,00:19:15.737,&lrm;What the fuck are you doing?
00:19:15.821,00:19:18.907,&lrm;BOY: Buying popcorn. &lrm;What the fuck are you doing?
00:19:20.284,00:19:21.910,&lrm;GIRL: I can't believe &lrm;you freaking did that.
00:19:21.993,00:19:24.913,&lrm;-BOY: He's a little punk. &lrm;-GIRL: Why do you have to be such a dick?
00:19:24.996,00:19:26.665,&lrm;BOY: Who the fuck cares?
00:19:30.669,00:19:32.421,&lrm;GIRL: I can't believe you just did that.
00:19:37.718,00:19:38.885,&lrm;Stop it!
00:19:39.345,00:19:40.679,&lrm;Stop hitting him.
00:19:41.388,00:19:43.098,&lrm;What's wrong with you?
00:19:45.226,00:19:47.102,"&lrm;GIRL: Somebody, please help us."
00:19:47.186,00:19:49.855,"&lrm;All right, that's it, kid. &lrm;You're out of here."
00:19:53.525,00:19:55.819,&lrm;GIRL: Get him away!
00:19:55.902,00:19:57.446,&lrm;Get him away!
00:19:58.113,00:20:05.120,"&lrm;Now in another story, &lrm;the peaceful town of Briarville &lrm;was rocked this afternoon &lrm;in the wake of a horrible act &lrm;of vandalism."
00:20:05.204,00:20:14.255,"&lrm;While police officials &lrm;in upstate New York believe &lrm;this was a simple act &lrm;of criminal mischief gone awry, &lrm;the tragedy has clearly &lrm;devastated the community."
00:20:14.338,00:20:20.969,&lrm;Now this was the grisly aftermath &lrm;of a powerful explosion &lrm;believed to have been caused &lrm;by an unknown quantity of dynamite.
00:20:21.720,00:20:25.098,"&lrm;The police have no leads, &lrm;no suspects and no motive..."
00:20:43.284,00:20:44.576,&lrm;Good night.
00:20:54.878,00:20:56.255,&lrm;We're moving.
00:21:14.440,00:21:17.108,&lrm;I can't believe &lrm;Tommy's still pissed at me.
00:21:17.192,00:21:19.528,"&lrm;He knows I'm moving away, right?"
00:21:19.611,00:21:21.530,&lrm;He's been acting real strange lately.
00:21:21.613,00:21:23.782,&lrm;He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
00:21:25.116,00:21:26.159,"&lrm;Duck, here they come!"
00:21:32.207,00:21:34.835,&lrm;Did your mom say if Lenny was okay?
00:21:36.837,00:21:39.881,"&lrm;He must be. &lrm;I mean, they're letting him out, right?"
00:22:04.573,00:22:05.574,&lrm;EVAN: Welcome home.
00:22:05.657,00:22:07.493,&lrm;I thought you might like &lrm;some fresh air for a change.
00:22:08.410,00:22:12.331,&lrm;-Is Tommy with you guys? &lrm;-No. It's cool.
00:22:22.674,00:22:24.926,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: So, what'd you do in there?"
00:22:25.010,00:22:29.806,&lrm;It was awful. You can't sleep &lrm;because everybody's screaming &lrm;all night long.
00:22:30.891,00:22:33.226,&lrm;I never want to go back.
00:22:33.309,00:22:34.561,&lrm;Do you see that?
00:22:34.645,00:22:36.438,"&lrm;EVAN: Yeah, what's up with the smoke?"
00:23:00.045,00:23:01.087,&lrm;Crockett!
00:23:01.672,00:23:03.048,&lrm;What are you doing with my dog?
00:23:08.970,00:23:11.432,&lrm;-Look what you made me do! &lrm;-What the hell's wrong with you?
00:23:26.404,00:23:29.616,"&lrm;Kayleigh. Oh, God, &lrm;come on, please wake up."
00:23:29.700,00:23:31.952,"&lrm;Wake up, please! Wake up!"
00:23:32.703,00:23:35.038,"&lrm;Why don't you fucking kiss her, &lrm;Prince Charming?"
00:23:51.262,00:23:52.598,&lrm;How long was I out?
00:23:55.934,00:23:57.519,"&lrm;Kayleigh, what's wrong?"
00:24:56.119,00:24:57.495,&lrm;I'm sorry.
00:25:26.274,00:25:27.275,&lrm;STUDENT: Aced it.
00:25:27.358,00:25:33.740,&lrm;And time. Put your pencils down &lrm;and place your blue books &lrm;on my desk before you leave.
00:25:33.824,00:25:36.785,"&lrm;You too, Mr. Nelson. &lrm;We're all in the same time zone here."
00:25:36.868,00:25:39.412,"&lrm;-NELSON: Fuck you. &lrm;-So, how'd you do, Evan?"
00:25:39.495,00:25:43.041,&lrm;I don't know. I might have got &lrm;some of the stories mixed up.
00:25:43.124,00:25:45.752,&lrm;Was it Pavlov that conditioned his dog &lrm;to lick his nuts?
00:25:47.879,00:25:50.173,"&lrm;Typical psych major, a complete wise-ass."
00:25:51.049,00:25:52.383,&lrm;And how's your project coming?
00:25:52.467,00:25:56.554,&lrm;Are you still planning to change the way &lrm;we humble scientists &lrm;view memory assimilation?
00:25:57.097,00:25:58.556,&lrm;Don't really have a choice.
00:26:28.169,00:26:31.131,"&lrm;Oh, jeez, it smells like &lrm;patchouli and ass in here."
00:26:31.214,00:26:34.509,"&lrm;Cricket, this is my &lrm;well-mannered roommate Evan."
00:26:34.592,00:26:35.761,&lrm;Yeah.
00:26:37.095,00:26:40.348,&lrm;You're the one &lrm;that fucked up the bell curve &lrm;on my anthropology final.
00:26:40.431,00:26:42.433,"&lrm;-Later, Thumper. &lrm;-Bye."
00:26:42.517,00:26:43.894,&lrm;CRICKET: Fucking dick.
00:26:45.311,00:26:47.522,"&lrm;-Wow, sweet girl, man. &lrm;-I found your shirt, bro."
00:26:52.235,00:26:55.781,"&lrm;All right, man, get dressed. &lrm;You're taking me out."
00:26:55.864,00:26:58.574,"&lrm;Why, what'd you do, ace another midterm?"
00:26:58.659,00:26:59.743,&lrm;No.
00:27:02.287,00:27:05.123,"&lrm;Better than that, &lrm;seven years, no blackouts."
00:27:05.957,00:27:08.669,"&lrm;-Fuck yeah, bro', let's do this! Come on. &lrm;-Oh, yeah."
00:27:09.460,00:27:11.713,&lrm;-Yeah? &lrm;-Come and get it. Be gentle with me!
00:27:11.797,00:27:14.090,&lrm;Be gentle! I'm postcoital. &lrm;I'm tender. There's chafing.
00:27:14.174,00:27:16.176,&lrm;Did she cradle the balls &lrm;and work the shaft? Did she?
00:27:21.514,00:27:22.557,&lrm;Nice.
00:27:25.101,00:27:26.102,&lrm;Look at this fucking guy.
00:27:28.313,00:27:29.815,&lrm;Get the fuck out of my bar.
00:27:29.898,00:27:32.067,"&lrm;So, which one of you has the pet worm?"
00:27:32.984,00:27:35.028,"&lrm;Worms, plural!"
00:27:35.278,00:27:37.781,&lrm;Ah. That's so gross.
00:27:38.699,00:27:41.034,&lrm;Talk to him about it. He's got the fetish.
00:27:41.659,00:27:43.912,&lrm;Watch it. It's a psych project actually.
00:27:43.995,00:27:46.247,&lrm;It's a study on memory loss.
00:27:46.331,00:27:49.084,&lrm;Better explain before all this &lrm;excitement gives me a heart attack.
00:27:51.878,00:27:53.671,&lrm;10 bucks says he eats it off the floor.
00:27:54.756,00:28:05.350,"&lrm;Well, if I can figure out &lrm;how the memories &lrm;of a simple worm function, &lrm;it should help me to understand &lrm;the complexities &lrm;of the human brain."
00:28:07.518,00:28:08.854,&lrm;THUMPER: Let me get this shot.
00:28:16.527,00:28:18.071,"&lrm;-What the fuck, weirdo? &lrm;-Fuck this!"
00:28:32.543,00:28:34.504,&lrm;MAN 1: What have you got there?
00:28:37.340,00:28:39.550,"&lrm;MAN 3: No, no!"
00:28:41.302,00:28:43.263,&lrm;It smells like sex in here.
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.557,&lrm;guess Thumper had a busy afternoon.
00:28:48.143,00:28:50.686,&lrm;You're kidding? He's so big.
00:28:51.938,00:28:53.064,&lrm;Yeah?
00:28:53.148,00:28:56.902,"&lrm;Well, I guess charisma &lrm;and eyeliner go a long way."
00:28:58.528,00:29:00.530,&lrm;-You want a beer? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:29:03.574,00:29:06.619,&lrm;You got any incense &lrm;or scented candles or something?
00:29:06.702,00:29:07.913,&lrm;EVAN: Okay.
00:29:10.123,00:29:12.667,"&lrm;Whoa, no."
00:29:13.584,00:29:15.503,&lrm;Let me put this away.
00:29:15.586,00:29:17.964,&lrm;Most guys usually &lrm;tuck porn under their bed.
00:29:18.048,00:29:19.966,&lrm;All you've got are comp books?
00:29:20.050,00:29:21.592,"&lrm;Yeah, they're my journals."
00:29:21.676,00:29:24.095,&lrm;I've been keeping them since I was seven.
00:29:24.220,00:29:26.347,&lrm;Wow. Hmm.
00:29:31.352,00:29:33.188,&lrm;I ought to be getting &lrm;something out of this.
00:29:39.778,00:29:42.948,&lrm;It's like my mind refuses &lrm;to believe what I'm seeing.
00:29:48.494,00:29:52.373,&lrm;Hearing Crockett &lrm;make those awful screams.
00:29:57.753,00:30:01.424,"&lrm;Uh, J... Just writing about it &lrm;gives me the shivers."
00:30:03.634,00:30:05.971,&lrm;Come on. Go on.
00:30:10.266,00:30:14.187,&lrm;It was like Tommy &lrm;was possessed or something.
00:30:15.563,00:30:18.108,&lrm;There was a hate in his eyes that...
00:30:24.655,00:30:25.824,&lrm;Are you okay?
00:30:33.331,00:30:34.374,&lrm;EVAN: Where am I?
00:30:36.501,00:30:38.169,&lrm;What the hell's going on?
00:30:49.514,00:30:51.224,&lrm;I can't get it open!
00:30:51.307,00:30:52.767,&lrm;Drop it.
00:30:52.851,00:30:55.311,&lrm;Or I'll slit your mother's throat &lrm;in her sleep.
00:31:10.826,00:31:12.828,"&lrm;Listen to me, Evan, &lrm;and you listen to me good."
00:31:12.913,00:31:16.374,"&lrm;There's a million &lrm;other sisters in the world, &lrm;so why'd you have to fuck with mine?"
00:31:22.005,00:31:24.007,&lrm;It's okay. It was just a dream.
00:31:26.009,00:31:27.010,&lrm;Uh-uh.
00:31:27.677,00:31:31.097,&lrm;-It didn't feel like a dream. &lrm;-Maybe because they never do.
00:31:32.848,00:31:35.560,"&lrm;So, Don Juan, &lrm;you pass out on all your dates?"
00:32:12.138,00:32:13.139,&lrm;WOMAN: Lenny...
00:32:13.223,00:32:15.141,"&lrm;Hey, I've got a surprise for you."
00:32:15.225,00:32:17.227,&lrm;You're never gonna guess who's here.
00:32:17.310,00:32:20.271,"&lrm;Hey, it's me. Evan."
00:32:56.891,00:32:59.477,&lrm;What are you working on there? A model?
00:33:02.730,00:33:04.274,"&lrm;Look, uh..."
00:33:04.357,00:33:07.652,"&lrm;I can see that you're busy, &lrm;so I'll try to make this quick."
00:33:08.694,00:33:10.155,"&lrm;Remember, uh..."
00:33:11.322,00:33:13.992,&lrm;That day at the junkyard &lrm;when we were kids?
00:33:15.910,00:33:18.579,"&lrm;Well, I was just hoping &lrm;that you could help me remember."
00:33:21.749,00:33:25.503,"&lrm;Like, just any details about it or..."
00:33:31.509,00:33:32.635,&lrm;Yeah.
00:33:33.553,00:33:35.388,&lrm;That's good. Um...
00:33:37.348,00:33:38.433,&lrm;Anything else?
00:33:42.937,00:33:45.023,&lrm;Drop it or I'll slit &lrm;your mother's throat in her sleep!
00:33:49.235,00:33:50.236,&lrm;Uh...
00:33:55.700,00:33:57.410,&lrm;Jesus Christ.
00:34:00.496,00:34:01.539,&lrm;It really happened.
00:34:03.291,00:34:04.625,"&lrm;Wow, uh..."
00:34:10.590,00:34:16.011,"&lrm;Make one peep &lrm;and I swear it'll be &lrm;your last, motherfucker."
00:34:50.921,00:34:54.925,&lrm;The last thing I remember &lrm;before the blackout &lrm;was holding my hands &lrm;over Kayleigh's ears.
00:34:55.801,00:35:04.394,&lrm;I think I was more focused &lrm;on her hands on mine &lrm;than on the mailbox &lrm;across the street.
00:35:17.698,00:35:19.575,&lrm;LENNY: Maybe it went out. &lrm;Should someone check it?
00:35:19.659,00:35:21.286,"&lrm;Yeah, you do that, Lenny."
00:35:30.878,00:35:33.214,"&lrm;You make one peep and I swear &lrm;it'll be your last, motherfucker."
00:35:40.471,00:35:41.556,&lrm;Fuck!
00:35:47.145,00:35:49.855,&lrm;WOMAN: What's this? Huh? What's this?
00:35:56.154,00:35:58.989,&lrm;How's my sweet girl?
00:35:59.407,00:36:01.075,&lrm;How's my sweet girl?
00:36:01.159,00:36:03.578,"&lrm;You need a change, don't you, honey?"
00:36:03.661,00:36:05.413,&lrm;You wanna open it?
00:36:05.496,00:36:07.248,&lrm;You wanna open it?
00:36:10.042,00:36:11.627,"&lrm;-KAYLEIGH: Oh! Oh, my God! &lrm;-TOMMY: Holy shit!"
00:36:11.711,00:36:13.838,&lrm;Run!
00:36:13.921,00:36:16.257,"&lrm;Fuck, Lenny, come on!"
00:36:16.341,00:36:18.426,"&lrm;EVAN: Lenny, come on!"
00:36:18.509,00:36:20.303,"&lrm;Come on, Lenny, let's go!"
00:36:35.735,00:36:39.154,"&lrm;THUMPER: Christ, man, fucking brutal."
00:36:41.491,00:36:42.658,&lrm;EVAN: What the...
00:36:46.871,00:36:48.956,"&lrm;-EVAN: Hello. &lrm;-MRS. KAGAN: &lrm;Hello, who is this?"
00:36:49.582,00:36:52.793,"&lrm;Mrs. Kagan, uh, it's Evan Treborn."
00:36:52.877,00:36:55.921,&lrm;I hope you know how much you upset Lenny.
00:36:56.005,00:36:59.425,"&lrm;Yeah, I'm... &lrm;Look, I'm really sorry about that."
00:36:59.509,00:37:02.220,&lrm;It took me over an hour &lrm;to clean up the mess you made.
00:37:02.303,00:37:04.639,&lrm;Can I just talk to Lenny?
00:37:14.232,00:37:15.566,&lrm;Mom.
00:37:17.402,00:37:19.570,&lrm;I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you.
00:37:20.195,00:37:22.990,"&lrm;Did Dad, uh..."
00:37:23.073,00:37:25.576,&lrm;Did Jason get good grades?
00:37:25.660,00:37:28.663,"&lrm;Please, he got straight As &lrm;without ever touching a book."
00:37:28.746,00:37:31.499,&lrm;It was the one area &lrm;his memory never failed him.
00:37:31.582,00:37:41.216,"&lrm;Did he ever say that he, like, &lrm;figured out a way &lrm;to recall his lost memories, &lrm;like, years after he blacked them out &lrm;in the first place?"
00:37:41.301,00:37:50.476,"&lrm;-Why do you ask? &lrm;-No, I just figured with him being, &lrm;you know, such a brain and all, &lrm;it's like, you would think &lrm;that he would figure out &lrm;a way to remember stuff that he forgot."
00:37:51.602,00:37:59.860,"&lrm;Well, when he was your age, &lrm;almost exactly your age, &lrm;come to think of it, &lrm;he said he figured out &lrm;a way to remember his past."
00:37:59.944,00:38:03.197,&lrm;I couldn't tell if they were real memories &lrm;or just his imagination.
00:38:04.282,00:38:14.292,"&lrm;Then, just before it got so bad &lrm;he, uh...had to be institutionalized, &lrm;he said he could..."
00:38:16.251,00:38:17.295,&lrm;What?
00:38:18.379,00:38:19.672,&lrm;What?
00:38:22.717,00:38:25.470,&lrm;-What did he do? &lrm;-Forget it.
00:38:25.553,00:38:28.973,&lrm;It's nothing. He was far too sick by then.
00:38:40.067,00:38:42.362,"&lrm;I never wanted &lrm;to be in the movie, anyway."
00:38:43.654,00:38:47.157,"&lrm;It was cold, &lrm;so I wanted to wear my clothes."
00:38:47.241,00:38:49.243,&lrm;Mr. Miller took my shirt off.
00:38:49.327,00:38:53.498,"&lrm;-What the fuck are you doing? &lrm;-Shh, I need quiet for this."
00:38:53.581,00:38:56.417,"&lrm;Are you stupid or what, man?"
00:38:56.501,00:39:01.130,&lrm;Maybe there's a reason &lrm;you repressed the day &lrm;some pervert had you &lrm;in your tighty whities.
00:39:04.592,00:39:06.552,"&lrm;Man, I'd think twice &lrm;about what you're doing."
00:39:06.636,00:39:09.138,&lrm;You could wake up a lot more &lrm;fucked-up than you are now.
00:39:09.221,00:39:11.432,"&lrm;-More fucked-up than I already am? &lrm;-No, I'm..."
00:39:11.516,00:39:13.643,&lrm;You think you know me? I don't know me!
00:39:51.847,00:39:52.848,&lrm;Whoa!
00:39:54.392,00:39:55.685,"&lrm;Oh, shit. Sorry."
00:39:56.561,00:39:58.270,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: No, it's my fault."
00:39:58.353,00:40:02.066,&lrm;Can we get through one damn day &lrm;without you breaking something?
00:40:29.594,00:40:30.720,&lrm;Hey.
00:40:35.265,00:40:36.350,&lrm;Evan.
00:40:38.143,00:40:41.313,"&lrm;Oh, my God. It's been a long time."
00:40:43.273,00:40:47.277,"&lrm;-How you been? &lrm;-Same old, same old, you know?"
00:40:47.361,00:40:50.114,"&lrm;No, I don't know. Fill me in."
00:40:51.449,00:40:53.534,"&lrm;Uh, well..."
00:40:53.618,00:40:55.620,&lrm;I'm going to State now.
00:40:55.703,00:40:58.372,&lrm;It's going good. My mom's good.
00:40:59.457,00:41:00.750,&lrm;-I don't know. &lrm;-You want a smoke?
00:41:01.709,00:41:03.628,"&lrm;-No, not since we were kids. &lrm;-No?"
00:41:10.384,00:41:11.677,&lrm;Are you walking home?
00:41:12.261,00:41:13.262,&lrm;Uh-huh.
00:41:13.345,00:41:15.264,&lrm;-Can I walk you? &lrm;-Sure.
00:41:18.476,00:41:20.603,"&lrm;-Oh, my God. &lrm;-So..."
00:41:23.564,00:41:25.483,&lrm;How's Tommy?
00:41:28.360,00:41:34.199,"&lrm;Well, they kept him &lrm;in juvie for a few years, &lrm;but now he's working &lrm;over at Dale's Auto Body."
00:41:35.117,00:41:36.326,&lrm;That's good.
00:41:39.079,00:41:40.540,&lrm;Still living with your dad?
00:41:41.290,00:41:42.708,&lrm;No.
00:41:42.792,00:41:44.877,&lrm;I emancipated myself at 15.
00:41:47.462,00:41:49.757,&lrm;Must've taken a lot of courage.
00:41:50.090,00:41:52.259,&lrm;Not if you remember my dad.
00:41:55.846,00:41:59.517,"&lrm;Well, couldn't you have just &lrm;moved in with your mom?"
00:41:59.600,00:42:01.268,"&lrm;No, she had a new family."
00:42:01.351,00:42:04.021,&lrm;Wasn't enough room. Whatever.
00:42:05.147,00:42:09.443,"&lrm;Well, look, the reason I came back to town &lrm;was to talk to you."
00:42:09.527,00:42:11.571,&lrm;To me? Why?
00:42:16.617,00:42:20.037,&lrm;Remember when we were kids &lrm;and I used to have those blackouts?
00:42:21.205,00:42:22.414,"&lrm;Yeah, of course."
00:42:23.708,00:42:26.877,"&lrm;Well, some of those memories &lrm;have been coming back to me."
00:42:26.961,00:42:32.132,&lrm;And I just I wanted to talk to you &lrm;about one of them in particular.
00:42:32.216,00:42:33.843,"&lrm;Well, I'll try to remember."
00:42:38.681,00:42:40.766,"&lrm;When we were kids, uh..."
00:42:40.850,00:42:45.605,"&lrm;your dad was making a movie &lrm;about Robin Hood, something."
00:42:46.521,00:42:48.148,"&lrm;What do you want to know, Evan?"
00:42:52.612,00:42:54.739,&lrm;Is... Did he...
00:42:56.115,00:42:58.993,&lrm;What happened in the basement?
00:42:59.076,00:43:00.911,"&lrm;Look, it was a long time ago."
00:43:02.913,00:43:04.832,&lrm;I know.
00:43:04.915,00:43:07.668,&lrm;Is that why you came &lrm;all the way back here?
00:43:07.752,00:43:10.337,&lrm;To ask a lot of stupid questions &lrm;about Robin Hood?
00:43:10.420,00:43:12.422,"&lrm;No, I..."
00:43:13.423,00:43:16.343,&lrm;I just think that something &lrm;really bad might have happened.
00:43:16.426,00:43:18.220,&lrm;Is there a point to any of this?
00:43:20.765,00:43:23.517,"&lrm;Look, whatever happened, &lrm;it wasn't our fault."
00:43:23.601,00:43:26.561,"&lrm;We were kids. I mean, there was &lrm;nothing that we could do to deserve..."
00:43:26.646,00:43:29.023,"&lrm;Just shut up, Evan!"
00:43:29.106,00:43:30.565,&lrm;You're wasting your breath.
00:43:31.275,00:43:34.028,&lrm;You can't hate yourself &lrm;'cause your dad's a twisted freak.
00:43:34.612,00:43:37.572,"&lrm;Who are you trying to convince, Evan?"
00:43:37.657,00:43:42.119,&lrm;You come all the way back here &lrm;to stir up my shit &lrm;just because you have a bad memory?
00:43:42.953,00:43:47.499,"&lrm;What, do you want me &lrm;to just cry on your shoulder &lrm;and tell you everything's all better now?"
00:43:47.582,00:43:49.710,"&lrm;Well, fuck you, Evan!"
00:43:49.794,00:43:53.088,"&lrm;Nothing's all better, okay? &lrm;Nothing ever gets better."
00:43:57.677,00:44:02.181,"&lrm;You know, if I was so wonderful, Evan, &lrm;why didn't you call me?"
00:44:02.264,00:44:03.808,&lrm;Why did you just leave me here to rot?
00:44:21.533,00:44:27.539,"&lrm;ANDREA: &lrm;When he was your age, &lrm;almost exactly your age, &lrm;come to think of it, &lrm;he said he figured out a way &lrm;to remember his past."
00:44:31.752,00:44:33.545,&lrm;Some dude left a message for you.
00:44:33.628,00:44:36.674,&lrm;You can smell that &lrm;all the way in the bathroom.
00:44:39.259,00:44:41.220,"&lrm;PROFESSOR CARTER: &lrm;Hi, Evan, &lrm;this is Professor Carter."
00:44:41.303,00:44:43.430,&lrm;I just wondered why you didn't &lrm;hand in your essay this afternoon.
00:44:43.513,00:44:46.391,&lrm;I was a bit concerned. &lrm;Call me to schedule a make-up.
00:44:50.938,00:44:53.565,"&lrm;TOMMY: &lrm;What'd you say &lrm;to my sister, motherfucker?"
00:44:53.648,00:44:56.819,&lrm;Last night she cried on the phone &lrm;for over an hour to me.
00:44:56.902,00:44:59.780,&lrm;She said you came and saw her last night.
00:44:59.864,00:45:01.615,&lrm;She...
00:45:01.698,00:45:04.618,&lrm;She fucking killed herself tonight.
00:45:04.701,00:45:06.661,&lrm;She's dead.
00:45:06.746,00:45:08.122,&lrm;And so are you!
00:46:28.285,00:46:34.458,"&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;If the scar on my stomach &lrm;didn't just come out of nowhere, &lrm;maybe my father wasn't &lrm;as crazy as everyone thought."
00:46:36.418,00:46:39.546,"&lrm;If I can make scars, &lrm;do I have the power to heal them?"
00:46:42.132,00:46:44.009,&lrm;What about Kayleigh's scars?
00:46:49.974,00:46:53.060,"&lrm;I never wanted &lrm;to be in the movie, anyway."
00:46:53.143,00:46:57.481,"&lrm;It was cold, &lrm;so I wanted to wear my clothes."
00:47:00.025,00:47:03.487,&lrm;But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.
00:47:15.832,00:47:18.377,&lrm;I've got an idea. &lrm;Let's go down to the basement.
00:47:18.460,00:47:20.337,&lrm;It'll look more like a dungeon down there.
00:47:22.965,00:47:25.009,&lrm;A little light here.
00:47:25.717,00:47:27.177,&lrm;Huh?
00:47:28.971,00:47:32.432,"&lrm;Hey, now what did I tell you &lrm;about keeping that door shut?"
00:47:32.516,00:47:33.934,&lrm;But I wanna see.
00:47:34.018,00:47:38.230,&lrm;You're going to see the back &lrm;of my fist in about two seconds &lrm;if you don't do what I tell you.
00:47:40.524,00:47:51.160,"&lrm;Now, in this part of the story, &lrm;Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian &lrm;and they have to kiss and stuff, &lrm;like the grown-ups do."
00:47:52.536,00:47:54.914,"&lrm;So, take off your clothes, Kayleigh."
00:47:58.208,00:48:00.627,"&lrm;Come on, just like when we take a bath."
00:48:00.710,00:48:02.879,"&lrm;Don't make a big deal out of it. &lrm;You too, Evan."
00:48:04.798,00:48:06.341,"&lrm;Come on, let's go."
00:48:06.425,00:48:08.385,&lrm;Let's go. We're making a movie here.
00:48:17.144,00:48:20.189,&lrm;time for you to do what I tell you to do.
00:48:20.522,00:48:22.566,"&lrm;Wrong answer, fuckbag!"
00:48:22.649,00:48:25.444,&lrm;This is the very moment of your reckoning.
00:48:25.527,00:48:28.948,"&lrm;In the next 30 seconds, &lrm;you're going to open up one of two doors."
00:48:29.031,00:48:32.326,&lrm;The first door will forever traumatize &lrm;your own flesh and blood.
00:48:35.745,00:48:37.497,&lrm;How are you doing this?
00:48:37.581,00:48:48.758,&lrm;It'll change your daughter &lrm;from a beautiful child &lrm;into an empty shell &lrm;whose only concept of trust &lrm;was betrayed by her own &lrm;sick pedophile father!
00:48:49.509,00:48:52.512,"&lrm;Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide."
00:48:53.513,00:48:55.890,"&lrm;-Nice work, Daddy. &lrm;-Who are you?"
00:48:55.975,00:48:59.353,"&lrm;Let's just say you're being &lrm;closely watched, George!"
00:48:59.436,00:49:02.147,&lrm;Your other option is &lrm;to treat Kayleigh like...
00:49:02.814,00:49:05.317,&lrm;Say like a loving father &lrm;treats his daughter.
00:49:06.235,00:49:08.028,"&lrm;Sound okay to you, Papa?"
00:49:09.779,00:49:12.741,"&lrm;-Yes. &lrm;-Listen close then, fuckbag."
00:49:13.742,00:49:17.662,"&lrm;You screw this up again, &lrm;I'll flat out castrate you."
00:49:19.748,00:49:25.420,"&lrm;What you need to do &lrm;is discipline your son Tommy, &lrm;'cause the kid is one sadistic pup."
00:49:27.256,00:49:28.590,&lrm;One last thing.
00:49:35.847,00:49:37.682,&lrm;Don't ever touch me again!
00:49:39.643,00:49:41.103,&lrm;I... I won't.
00:50:07.546,00:50:08.713,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Crockett!
00:50:10.632,00:50:11.675,"&lrm;Kayleigh, I can't believe you came..."
00:50:14.010,00:50:15.804,&lrm;I think you got one.
00:50:15.887,00:50:17.222,&lrm;Check out our new house.
00:50:19.058,00:50:20.184,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Hell or high water.
00:50:25.980,00:50:27.566,"&lrm;Honey, are you all right?"
00:50:30.777,00:50:32.779,"&lrm;Oh, my God, Evan, you're bleeding."
00:50:32.862,00:50:35.324,"&lrm;Kayleigh, you're still you."
00:50:35.782,00:50:37.033,&lrm;The...
00:50:38.202,00:50:39.203,&lrm;Oh...
00:50:39.286,00:50:40.370,&lrm;Incredible.
00:50:40.454,00:50:44.708,&lrm;Thanks. Go get cleaned up &lrm;and come back to bed.
00:50:47.419,00:50:48.545,&lrm;Where are my clothes?
00:50:49.379,00:50:50.880,"&lrm;Those are your clothes, silly."
00:50:59.431,00:51:00.932,&lrm;The bathroom is...
00:51:05.479,00:51:07.731,&lrm;Hurry up. I want a quickie before school.
00:51:15.780,00:51:48.605,"&lrm;GIRLS: &lrm;We'll astound you with our beauty &lrm;leave you nothing to say &lrm;C-h-i, P-h-i, B-e-t-a, meow &lrm;What?"
00:51:50.524,00:51:51.858,&lrm;Un-fucking-believable.
00:51:53.443,00:51:54.569,&lrm;All right.
00:51:54.653,00:51:57.614,&lrm;I wish I could get &lrm;as excited over a nosebleed.
00:51:58.615,00:52:01.451,"&lrm;Sorry, uh, I didn't see you."
00:52:04.496,00:52:05.872,&lrm;What?
00:52:05.955,00:52:10.794,&lrm;You're the girl &lrm;that was with those assholes &lrm;throwing popcorn at Thumper.
00:52:11.795,00:52:12.796,&lrm;What?
00:52:13.630,00:52:15.965,&lrm;And your name is Gwen.
00:52:16.758,00:52:17.967,&lrm;I know you.
00:52:19.803,00:52:21.930,"&lrm;Seriously, Evan, lay off the blow."
00:52:26.976,00:52:28.144,&lrm;-Hi. &lrm;-Hi.
00:52:34.150,00:52:36.570,"&lrm;Hey, um..."
00:52:36.653,00:52:39.030,"&lrm;Don't freak out &lrm;when I ask you this, but..."
00:52:40.490,00:52:43.577,&lrm;Do you remember when your dad &lrm;got that video camera?
00:52:43.660,00:52:44.828,"&lrm;What's up, man?"
00:52:46.079,00:52:48.081,"&lrm;Yeah, um..."
00:52:48.164,00:52:52.043,"&lrm;I think he had it, like, the first day &lrm;and then he gave it away or something."
00:52:52.669,00:52:54.546,&lrm;Why would that freak me out?
00:52:56.215,00:52:57.924,&lrm;I don't know.
00:52:59.843,00:53:02.011,&lrm;You are such a goofus.
00:53:05.181,00:53:07.100,"&lrm;So, I'll see you tonight?"
00:53:07.183,00:53:08.310,&lrm;Okay.
00:53:28.955,00:53:30.749,"&lrm;Come on, come on."
00:53:30.832,00:53:32.125,&lrm;-ANDREA: &lrm;Andrea... &lrm;-EVAN: &lrm;Evan...

00:53:36.463,00:53:38.590,"&lrm;Uh, hey, Mom."
00:53:38.673,00:53:41.635,"&lrm;It's me. And hey, Chuck."
00:53:41.718,00:53:44.721,"&lrm;Uh, I'm just calling to say hi, I guess."
00:53:44.804,00:53:45.972,&lrm;Give me a call back.
00:53:50.352,00:53:53.688,"&lrm;Hey, Thumper, do you know &lrm;what time it is, man?"
00:53:53.772,00:53:56.650,"&lrm;What's the matter, you lost your Rolex?"
00:53:56.733,00:53:58.402,"&lrm;Fuck you, frat boy!"
00:54:02.572,00:54:07.076,"&lrm;Remember, everyone, &lrm;there's only two more weeks &lrm;until your psych projects are due."
00:54:07.160,00:54:12.791,"&lrm;Uh, about that essay I missed last week, &lrm;we're still okay &lrm;with the extension, right?"
00:54:12.874,00:54:14.459,&lrm;And you are?
00:54:14.543,00:54:17.170,&lrm;Evan Treborn.
00:54:17.253,00:54:19.047,"&lrm;Well, the answer's no, Mr. Treborn."
00:54:19.130,00:54:21.966,&lrm;Now please take your seat. &lrm;The exam is about to begin.
00:54:27.306,00:54:29.015,"&lrm;All right, settle down, everyone."

00:54:37.273,00:54:38.358,"&lrm;Get off me, asshole."
00:54:38.442,00:54:41.194,&lrm;You guys started that shit.
00:54:41.277,00:54:42.862,"&lrm;Evan, you're hysterical."
00:54:45.615,00:54:46.950,&lrm;Did you study for this?
00:54:48.993,00:54:50.495,"&lrm;Oh, uh..."
00:54:51.204,00:54:52.997,"&lrm;We'll find out, huh?"
00:55:06.928,00:55:08.388,&lrm;Holy shit! Are these the answers?
00:55:08.472,00:55:10.306,"&lrm;Damn, Evan, keep it on the DL."
00:55:17.481,00:55:18.773,"&lrm;Hey, uh..."
00:55:19.608,00:55:23.194,&lrm;I want to do something special &lrm;for Kayleigh tomorrow night. Uh...
00:55:23.903,00:55:28.867,"&lrm;So, if I said that I needed &lrm;some help from you and the brothers..."
00:55:28.950,00:55:30.744,"&lrm;I'd say, Blow me."
00:55:32.912,00:55:35.415,&lrm;Get the pledges to do it.
00:55:35.665,00:55:38.251,"&lrm;-Right, the pledges. &lrm;-Yeah."
00:55:38.334,00:55:40.629,&lrm;PROFESSOR CARTER: You may begin now!
00:55:57.854,00:56:00.356,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Oh, that was so good."
00:56:01.525,00:56:02.859,"&lrm;Oh, my God."
00:56:04.819,00:56:06.571,&lrm;Where'd you learn those new tricks?
00:56:08.657,00:56:09.866,&lrm;Why?
00:56:11.034,00:56:13.703,"&lrm;It wasn't weird, was it?"
00:56:15.204,00:56:18.082,"&lrm;Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird."
00:56:27.383,00:56:28.468,&lrm;Hello?
00:56:31.179,00:56:32.806,&lrm;-Fuck 'em. &lrm;-Hello?
00:56:38.812,00:56:39.813,&lrm;Oh...
00:56:44.568,00:56:51.533,&lrm;What do you think it is about us &lrm;that makes us so perfect?
00:56:53.452,00:56:55.119,&lrm;-Hmm. &lrm;-I mean...
00:56:56.538,00:57:01.710,&lrm;Why did you sneak out &lrm;to visit me after I moved away?
00:57:01.793,00:57:03.503,&lrm;'Cause I missed you.
00:57:06.715,00:57:09.342,"&lrm;What, do you think my dad could have &lrm;stopped me from seeing you?"
00:57:14.598,00:57:16.766,"&lrm;Oh, my gosh. My toes are numb."
00:57:18.309,00:57:20.895,&lrm;Do you think that &lrm;we'll be together forever?
00:57:25.775,00:57:27.527,"&lrm;That is the plan, isn't it?"
00:57:29.779,00:57:32.616,&lrm;-Hell or high water? &lrm;-Yeah.
00:57:33.825,00:57:35.326,"&lrm;Yeah, that's..."
00:57:35.409,00:57:36.786,&lrm;I was just making sure.
00:57:53.094,00:57:55.138,"&lrm;All right, uh..."
00:57:56.640,00:58:00.268,"&lrm;All you rushes, &lrm;you know what you have to do for me."
00:58:00.351,00:58:02.061,"&lrm;Pledges, uh..."
00:58:02.145,00:58:03.938,"&lrm;MAN 1: We're pledges, sir."
00:58:04.564,00:58:07.191,"&lrm;Uh, brother Evan, sir."
00:58:14.491,00:58:16.535,&lrm;What? What did you say to me?
00:58:16.618,00:58:17.827,"&lrm;You know what, give me the Greek alphabet."
00:58:17.911,00:58:19.078,&lrm;-Uh... &lrm;-Give it to me!
00:58:20.789,00:58:26.795,"&lrm;-Alpha, beta... &lrm;-Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, &lrm;zeta, eta, theta, iota, &lrm;kappa, lambda, mu, nu, xi, &lrm;omicron, pi, rho, sigma, tau, &lrm;upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega, sir."
00:58:27.128,00:58:29.673,"&lrm;Maybe that's what it is. &lrm;Don't fucking look at me, look down."
00:58:35.720,00:58:37.180,&lrm;Uh...
00:58:38.765,00:58:40.725,"&lrm;All right, um..."
00:58:45.354,00:58:47.524,&lrm;you guys know what you need to do for me.
00:58:47.607,00:58:53.822,"&lrm;And, um, you guys take a shower &lrm;and if anyone gives you any trouble, &lrm;you tell 'em I said it was okay."
00:58:57.826,00:58:58.868,&lrm;What?
00:59:10.171,00:59:12.340,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: I don't understand. &lrm;Where are you taking me?
00:59:12.423,00:59:14.175,&lrm;EVAN: I'm not telling.
00:59:32.443,00:59:34.779,"&lrm;Wow, it's beautiful."
00:59:36.447,00:59:38.449,"&lrm;Go on, sit down."
00:59:38.532,00:59:39.909,&lrm;Thank you.
00:59:51.379,00:59:52.839,&lrm;Why are you doing this for me?
00:59:54.548,00:59:59.596,"&lrm;When I woke up this morning, &lrm;I saw your smile."
01:00:01.222,01:00:10.148,&lrm;That smile. And I knew &lrm;that I wanted to spend &lrm;the rest of my life with you.
01:00:24.120,01:00:25.955,"&lrm;I've been looking all over for you, man."
01:00:26.039,01:00:27.456,&lrm;Someone trashed your car.
01:00:35.339,01:00:36.716,&lrm;What the...
01:00:38.384,01:00:40.594,&lrm;Who did this?
01:00:40.679,01:00:42.221,&lrm;Who did it?
01:00:42.305,01:00:44.140,&lrm;It was probably those Beta fuckers.
01:00:45.141,01:00:47.560,"&lrm;No, no, no."
01:00:47.644,01:00:50.689,&lrm;How did somebody get away with this &lrm;right in front of the frat house?
01:00:53.817,01:00:55.068,"&lrm;MAN 1: Dude, what is that, a dog collar?"
01:00:55.151,01:00:56.903,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Tommy.
01:00:56.986,01:00:59.322,&lrm;MAN 2: Someone's gonna &lrm;get their ass kicked.
01:00:59.405,01:01:00.657,&lrm;Don't.
01:01:02.491,01:01:03.952,&lrm;He might be watching.
01:01:05.369,01:01:06.830,&lrm;It's my fault.
01:01:06.913,01:01:09.207,&lrm;I should have told you &lrm;he was released a few weeks ago.
01:01:09.290,01:01:11.084,"&lrm;Yeah, it might have been nice."
01:01:15.504,01:01:16.630,&lrm;God.
01:01:22.846,01:01:25.139,&lrm;Like this is gonna do any good.
01:01:25.223,01:01:27.100,&lrm;Maybe one of the frat guys got a gun.
01:01:27.183,01:01:29.518,"&lrm;Evan, don't even joke!"
01:01:29.602,01:01:31.104,"&lrm;He's not going to hurt you, okay?"
01:01:31.187,01:01:33.272,&lrm;He's just trying &lrm;to scare you away from me.
01:01:33.356,01:01:35.608,&lrm;He killed my dog.
01:01:35.692,01:01:36.776,&lrm;You don't remember that?
01:01:36.860,01:01:38.820,"&lrm;Evan, it's not his fault."
01:01:38.903,01:01:41.364,&lrm;You know how bad he had it &lrm;when we were kids.
01:01:41.447,01:01:45.243,"&lrm;Oh, no, don't give me &lrm;this bad upbringing shit."
01:01:45.326,01:01:46.494,&lrm;You turned out just fine.
01:01:46.577,01:01:48.913,&lrm;My father never laid a hand on me.
01:01:49.831,01:01:52.333,&lrm;It's like that prick &lrm;saved it all up for Tommy.
01:01:57.546,01:02:00.174,&lrm;Okay. All right.
01:02:00.759,01:02:01.885,&lrm;Uh...
01:02:04.012,01:02:06.890,&lrm;We'll let campus security &lrm;deal with it. Okay?
01:02:08.892,01:02:11.560,&lrm;You know what? &lrm;I think I should sleep alone.
01:02:13.396,01:02:16.232,"&lrm;No, you're not staying alone. &lrm;I'm staying with you."
01:02:16.315,01:02:19.819,"&lrm;Evan, I just don't want Tommy &lrm;to see us together right now."
01:02:19.903,01:02:23.197,"&lrm;No, I lost you once &lrm;and I'm not losing you again."
01:02:23.281,01:02:24.949,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: What do you mean &lrm;you lost me once?
01:02:25.033,01:02:28.494,"&lrm;Evan, you've never lost me. &lrm;What are you talking about?"
01:02:28.577,01:02:30.955,"&lrm;God, you've been acting so weird lately."
01:02:32.165,01:02:34.834,"&lrm;Look, my car just got wrecked, okay? &lrm;I'm kind of freaking out."
01:02:35.835,01:02:37.586,"&lrm;I know that, but..."
01:02:37.670,01:02:39.380,&lrm;Your accent's changed.
01:02:39.463,01:02:41.299,&lrm;You don't even walk the same.
01:02:41.382,01:02:42.550,"&lrm;What, I walk differently?"
01:02:42.633,01:02:46.470,"&lrm;I mean, that dinner tonight, &lrm;it was so beautiful. It was gorgeous."
01:02:46.554,01:02:48.848,&lrm;But it just wasn't you.
01:02:48.932,01:02:51.517,"&lrm;I can't do something nice for you? &lrm;I mean, it's..."
01:02:52.769,01:02:56.105,&lrm;Wait. Isn't that your jacket?
01:03:06.825,01:03:08.201,&lrm;Tommy!
01:03:09.911,01:03:11.788,"&lrm;You stay away from us, you sick fuck."
01:03:12.163,01:03:14.373,"&lrm;Oh, get this us shit."
01:03:14.457,01:03:17.001,&lrm;Like I'd ever lay a hand on my own sister.
01:03:17.085,01:03:19.337,"&lrm;You're doing real nice for yourself, Evan."
01:03:19.420,01:03:25.176,"&lrm;You've got a nice life, &lrm;you got nice friends, &lrm;not to mention you're fucking my sister."
01:03:25.969,01:03:28.179,&lrm;Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
01:03:28.262,01:03:30.974,"&lrm;-Shut up, Tommy! &lrm;-Oh, come on. That's a compliment."
01:03:31.599,01:03:33.559,"&lrm;All right, what are you doing, man? &lrm;What the fuck?"
01:03:33.642,01:03:36.645,&lrm;It's not good enough that the whole &lrm;fucking world loves you?
01:03:36.729,01:03:40.024,&lrm;But you've got to take &lrm;the only thing on this earth &lrm;that doesn't think &lrm;that I'm a piece of shit?
01:03:40.108,01:03:41.567,"&lrm;Tommy, you know I love you."
01:03:41.650,01:03:43.903,"&lrm;All right, look, no one thinks &lrm;that you're a piece of shit, Tom."
01:03:43.987,01:03:47.531,"&lrm;Oh, yeah, what was it you said? &lrm;I think I believe it was, uh, Sick fuck!"
01:03:51.327,01:03:53.412,"&lrm;Oh, God! Oh! Stop!"
01:03:54.788,01:03:56.040,&lrm;Stop!
01:03:56.707,01:03:58.877,"&lrm;Stop! Oh, my God!"
01:04:00.211,01:04:01.838,"&lrm;EVAN: Tommy, no."
01:04:03.506,01:04:05.466,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Stop! Oh, my God!"
01:04:05.549,01:04:06.550,&lrm;Oh...
01:04:11.973,01:04:15.684,&lrm;-Stop it! You're gonna kill him! &lrm;-EVAN: He's a fuckin' maniac!
01:04:17.061,01:04:19.522,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Don't do this, I'm begging you!"
01:04:22.733,01:04:24.318,&lrm;You killed Crockett!
01:04:24.402,01:04:26.320,&lrm;You killed that woman and her baby!
01:04:27.738,01:04:30.033,&lrm;Now you're trying to kill me.
01:04:30.116,01:04:32.451,&lrm;Just tryin' to fucking kill me!
01:04:41.710,01:04:43.129,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: What did you do?
01:04:47.633,01:04:50.094,"&lrm;Oh, my God! What did you do?"
01:05:24.545,01:05:26.089,"&lrm;You right there, faggot!"
01:05:54.075,01:05:55.243,&lrm;First time?
01:05:56.577,01:05:57.828,&lrm;Yeah.
01:05:59.663,01:06:01.958,"&lrm;You'd better not bitch up, man."
01:06:02.041,01:06:04.168,&lrm;You'll wind up someone's luggage that way.
01:06:10.133,01:06:11.675,&lrm;Can you protect me?
01:06:13.094,01:06:16.305,&lrm;Jesus himself couldn't make me &lrm;stand up against the Brotherhood.
01:06:27.858,01:06:29.277,"&lrm;Look, man."
01:06:30.778,01:06:35.616,"&lrm;When they come, &lrm;you go someplace else in your head, man."
01:06:56.304,01:06:57.555,&lrm;MAN 1: Back your ass up.
01:06:59.598,01:07:00.641,&lrm;MAN 2: Move away.
01:07:10.109,01:07:11.569,"&lrm;Yo, give me that!"
01:07:13.404,01:07:15.031,&lrm;-MAN 1: My shit. &lrm;-MAN 2: Yeah.
01:07:29.462,01:07:31.047,&lrm;I spoke to your lawyer.
01:07:32.256,01:07:36.469,"&lrm;And, uh, he says he's sure &lrm;he can get you off on self-defense."
01:07:36.552,01:07:38.096,"&lrm;So, if you're just patient..."
01:07:38.762,01:07:39.847,&lrm;Mom...
01:07:41.557,01:07:44.477,&lrm;-How long am I gonna be in here? &lrm;-I don't know.
01:07:45.811,01:07:47.688,&lrm;These things take time.
01:07:49.440,01:07:50.441,&lrm;What about the journals?
01:07:50.524,01:07:51.900,&lrm;Did you bring me the ones &lrm;that I asked you to bring?
01:07:51.984,01:07:54.403,"&lrm;Yeah, I found these two."
01:07:55.779,01:07:57.406,&lrm;The others are still in storage.
01:08:06.124,01:08:08.542,"&lrm;I need them all, all of them."
01:08:09.252,01:08:15.258,"&lrm;And I'm going to get them to you, &lrm;but right now, &lrm;you need to concentrate on the case."
01:08:17.093,01:08:18.094,&lrm;Uh...
01:08:18.927,01:08:20.138,&lrm;Please.
01:08:22.848,01:08:23.932,&lrm;All right.
01:08:25.101,01:08:26.185,&lrm;You're right.
01:08:30.856,01:08:31.899,&lrm;What about Kayleigh?
01:08:33.651,01:08:34.652,&lrm;Is she all right?
01:08:39.740,01:08:41.200,&lrm;Try to tell her I'm sorry.
01:08:45.621,01:08:46.747,&lrm;GUARD: Time's up.
01:08:46.830,01:08:48.207,"&lrm;ANDREA: &lrm;I'm not going to lose you, kiddo."
01:08:48.957,01:08:50.793,&lrm;Promise me you'll hang on.
01:09:05.974,01:09:08.477,&lrm;Shit on my dick or blood on my knife.
01:09:17.320,01:09:18.321,&lrm;EVAN: They're mine.
01:09:33.043,01:09:34.170,&lrm;Come on!
01:09:36.839,01:09:38.924,&lrm;-GUARD 1: Back the fuck off! &lrm;-Poof!
01:09:40.133,01:09:41.344,"&lrm;Show's over, ladies!"
01:09:44.680,01:09:46.307,&lrm;Put this maggot back in his cell.
01:09:46.390,01:09:48.976,"&lrm;GUARD 2: Move it! Come on, let's go!"
01:10:05.033,01:10:07.536,"&lrm;We'll be seeing you &lrm;later on tonight, little sister."
01:10:37.316,01:10:39.402,&lrm;MAN: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
01:10:48.160,01:10:53.416,"&lrm;You're religious, Carlos, &lrm;you believe in that whole bit, &lrm;the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
01:10:55.418,01:10:56.585,"&lrm;Straight up, man."
01:10:57.586,01:11:00.881,&lrm;'Cause I think Jesus sent me &lrm;to your cell for a reason.
01:11:02.049,01:11:03.216,&lrm;For you to help me.
01:11:04.802,01:11:05.928,&lrm;Shit.
01:11:07.346,01:11:09.014,"&lrm;I knew you were crazy, man."
01:11:09.097,01:11:10.599,&lrm;I ain't bullshitting you.
01:11:10.683,01:11:12.643,&lrm;Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
01:11:12.726,01:11:14.102,"&lrm;Oh, yeah?"
01:11:15.354,01:11:17.022,&lrm;That's cool. Great.
01:11:18.691,01:11:20.859,&lrm;A pack of smokes says &lrm;I can prove it to you.
01:11:25.323,01:11:28.617,"&lrm;When I'm out, I need you to watch &lrm;my hands and face closely."
01:11:29.868,01:11:31.745,"&lrm;You need to see the prison shrink, man."
01:11:32.455,01:11:34.998,&lrm;Just tell me &lrm;if you see anything just weird.
01:11:37.250,01:11:38.461,&lrm;Weirder than this?
01:11:38.544,01:11:41.422,"&lrm;It could be marks. It could be scars. &lrm;It could be anything, I don't know."
01:11:44.508,01:11:47.886,"&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;On Wednesday, I got in trouble &lrm;for a drawing I didn't do."
01:11:47.970,01:11:49.555,&lrm;Mommy won't let me see it.
01:12:04.945,01:12:07.823,"&lrm;Hey, no monkey business, Evan. &lrm;Sit down and finish your drawing."
01:12:12.453,01:12:13.662,"&lrm;That's great, everyone."
01:12:13.746,01:12:15.623,&lrm;Just imagine what you want to be.
01:12:15.706,01:12:16.790,&lrm;There's no limits.
01:12:27.385,01:12:29.845,"&lrm;Oh, Mrs. Boswell."
01:12:32.973,01:12:35.183,"&lrm;Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!"
01:12:35.684,01:12:37.936,"&lrm;Look, it's stigmata, man!"
01:12:38.020,01:12:40.188,&lrm;What'd you see? What'd it look like?
01:12:40.272,01:12:42.900,"&lrm;The signs of the Lord, man. &lrm;They just come out of nowhere."
01:12:45.235,01:12:47.029,"&lrm;I thought you were fucking crazy, man."
01:12:49.156,01:12:50.408,&lrm;So now you believe me.
01:12:53.035,01:12:54.412,"&lrm;Straight up, man."
01:13:06.173,01:13:07.675,&lrm;EVAN: Wanna make a deal?
01:13:11.053,01:13:15.391,"&lrm;All right, look. I'm new here, &lrm;but I think I get how things work."
01:13:17.059,01:13:19.812,&lrm;You either join a gang or you're dead.
01:13:21.730,01:13:24.483,"&lrm;Well, I sure as fuck ain't joining up &lrm;with no spics or niggers."
01:13:26.652,01:13:28.278,&lrm;And I don't want to die.
01:13:29.029,01:13:30.072,&lrm;So...
01:13:34.242,01:13:35.411,&lrm;What do I gotta do?
01:13:36.662,01:13:39.623,"&lrm;I'm the new guy. &lrm;I've got to work my way up, so..."
01:13:41.417,01:13:45.378,&lrm;Should I suck your dick now?
01:13:46.714,01:13:47.840,&lrm;Or...
01:13:52.595,01:13:55.180,&lrm;Is your blood pure?
01:13:55.723,01:13:59.226,"&lrm;Well, I ain't no fucking kike, &lrm;if that's what you're asking me."
01:13:59.309,01:14:01.979,"&lrm;Well then, let's see what you got, honey."
01:14:03.021,01:14:05.608,&lrm;Watch the fucking teeth &lrm;or you'll be leaving without 'em.
01:14:05.691,01:14:06.942,"&lrm;Yes, sir."
01:14:15.826,01:14:17.160,&lrm;Come to Daddy.
01:14:22.750,01:14:23.876,&lrm;EVAN: Carlos!
01:14:30.799,01:14:33.552,&lrm;We took the woods behind the junkyard &lrm;just to make sure we wouldn't &lrm;bump into Tommy!
01:14:33.636,01:14:34.803,&lrm;We hadn't seen the smoke yet.
01:14:37.055,01:14:38.891,&lrm;Hold 'em. Hold 'em!
01:14:38.974,01:14:42.352,&lrm;We took the woods behind the junkyard &lrm;just to make sure &lrm;we wouldn't bump into Tommy.
01:14:42.435,01:14:43.479,&lrm;We hadn't seen the smoke yet.
01:14:48.734,01:14:50.653,"&lrm;Rot in hell, you fucking animals!"
01:14:52.821,01:14:54.865,"&lrm;Wait, before we..."
01:14:55.699,01:14:57.743,&lrm;We need something &lrm;that could open the sack.
01:15:09.379,01:15:10.422,"&lrm;I want you to take this, Lenny."
01:15:10.506,01:15:12.675,&lrm;Today's your day of atonement.
01:15:12.758,01:15:14.885,&lrm;I know how guilty you feel &lrm;about that woman and her baby.
01:15:15.761,01:15:17.888,"&lrm;Evan, stop it. It's not the time."
01:15:17.971,01:15:23.018,"&lrm;Now's the only time! &lrm;Today you get a chance to redeem yourself, &lrm;to start all over with a clean slate."
01:15:23.101,01:15:25.771,"&lrm;-What are you talking about? &lrm;-Evan, you're acting crazy."
01:15:25.854,01:15:28.982,"&lrm;Please, if you've ever &lrm;trusted me before, trust me on this one."
01:15:33.153,01:15:34.196,&lrm;Cut the rope.
01:15:38.450,01:15:39.660,&lrm;Come on.
01:15:42.370,01:15:44.873,"&lrm;-Listen to me good, Evan. &lrm;-I'll do whatever you want."
01:15:44.957,01:15:47.375,"&lrm;You don't want me &lrm;to see Kayleigh ever again, fine."
01:15:47.459,01:15:49.211,&lrm;Just let Crockett go.
01:15:49.294,01:15:53.173,"&lrm;Besides, if you kill him now, &lrm;they'll stick you in juvie for sure."
01:15:53.256,01:15:55.467,&lrm;And I know you'd never leave &lrm;your sister alone with your father.
01:16:07.646,01:16:08.647,"&lrm;Lenny, no!"
01:16:12.067,01:16:13.235,&lrm;God.
01:16:15.738,01:16:17.865,"&lrm;Oh, God, Lenny."
01:16:17.948,01:16:19.407,"&lrm;I said, cut the rope."
01:16:43.265,01:16:45.017,&lrm;It's all backwards.
01:16:59.447,01:17:00.448,&lrm;Who did it?
01:17:03.160,01:17:04.494,&lrm;MAN 2: &lrm;What the fuck?
01:17:13.128,01:17:14.212,&lrm;MAN 3: &lrm;Want a ride?
01:17:15.673,01:17:16.965,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Lenny.
01:17:21.303,01:17:24.014,&lrm;Somebody call 911!
01:17:24.097,01:17:26.767,&lrm;Evan! Evan! Fuck! Evan!
01:17:33.899,01:17:35.275,"&lrm;EVAN: Hey, Doc."
01:17:36.151,01:17:37.527,&lrm;What's the damage?
01:17:37.610,01:17:40.197,"&lrm;-How much time do I got? &lrm;-Cute, Evan."
01:17:40.280,01:17:42.199,&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: It's a little complicated.
01:17:42.282,01:17:44.242,&lrm;I haven't seen results like these before.
01:17:45.285,01:17:46.619,&lrm;Not even with my father?
01:17:48.288,01:17:51.166,"&lrm;Well, actually, they didn't &lrm;have these tests 20 years ago."
01:17:51.959,01:17:53.251,"&lrm;So, what did you find?"
01:17:53.335,01:17:58.173,"&lrm;We're finding most of the hemorrhaging &lrm;is coming from here, &lrm;the outer layer of the cerebral cortex."
01:17:58.256,01:18:00.092,"&lrm;That's where the memories are stored, Mom."
01:18:00.175,01:18:01.426,"&lrm;-Thank you, Evan. &lrm;-Uh-huh."
01:18:01.509,01:18:03.095,&lrm;I've never seen anything like it.
01:18:03.178,01:18:05.931,&lrm;We compared these &lrm;to the ones taken last year.
01:18:06.014,01:18:09.101,&lrm;We found severe hemorrhaging &lrm;and massive neural reconstruction.
01:18:09.184,01:18:10.518,&lrm;And what does that mean for Evan?
01:18:10.602,01:18:14.773,"&lrm;What he's saying, Mom, is that I've jammed &lrm;40 years worth of memories &lrm;into my head in the last year."
01:18:14.857,01:18:17.192,&lrm;It's overload city. &lrm;I've completely reprogrammed my brain.
01:18:17.860,01:18:20.362,"&lrm;-That about the gist of it, Doc? &lrm;-Yeah."
01:18:24.116,01:18:26.702,"&lrm;All right, I'm going to go &lrm;wait in the car."
01:18:26.785,01:18:29.287,"&lrm;The light in here is, kind of, &lrm;bugging my eyes, so..."
01:18:29.371,01:18:31.414,"&lrm;It was good seeing you, Doc. &lrm;It really was."
01:18:31.498,01:18:34.251,"&lrm;It was very, very informative."
01:18:35.168,01:18:40.340,"&lrm;But, you know, I got people to see &lrm;and things to read."
01:18:40.423,01:18:42.050,"&lrm;All right, see ya."
01:19:14.374,01:19:15.500,&lrm;Hey.
01:19:18.503,01:19:19.963,&lrm;It's me.
01:19:20.047,01:19:21.214,&lrm;Evan.
01:19:22.925,01:19:24.467,&lrm;Can I get you anything?
01:19:27.137,01:19:30.891,"&lrm;What about some of those &lrm;model airplanes you like, huh?"
01:19:38.565,01:19:39.983,&lrm;Lenny.
01:19:48.491,01:19:50.786,"&lrm;You knew the whole time, didn't you?"
01:19:53.621,01:20:05.467,"&lrm;When you put that shard in my hand, &lrm;Didn't you?"
01:20:07.302,01:20:08.345,&lrm;Yeah.
01:20:09.637,01:20:12.850,&lrm;-I knew. &lrm;-Then you should be where I am.
01:20:16.728,01:20:21.274,&lrm;You should be where I am.
01:20:41.669,01:20:43.505,&lrm;Today I get to meet my father.
01:20:44.923,01:20:46.466,&lrm;His name is Jason.
01:20:48.051,01:20:49.386,&lrm;And he's crazy.
01:20:51.847,01:20:53.723,&lrm;I hope he lets me call him Dad.
01:20:55.475,01:21:00.063,&lrm;You okay? 'Cause you look like &lrm;you went somewhere else &lrm;there for a second.
01:21:00.147,01:21:04.442,"&lrm;Look, Jason, &lrm;I need some fast answers from you &lrm;if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done."
01:21:06.486,01:21:08.571,&lrm;I was praying this curse &lrm;would have ended with me.
01:21:08.655,01:21:10.240,"&lrm;Yeah, but it didn't."
01:21:10.323,01:21:14.702,"&lrm;So, now I need information &lrm;to make things right again &lrm;and you're the only one &lrm;that can give it to me."
01:21:14.786,01:21:19.457,&lrm;There is no right. &lrm;You can't change who people are &lrm;without destroying who they were.
01:21:19.541,01:21:21.543,&lrm;Who says you can't make things better?
01:21:21.626,01:21:25.047,"&lrm;You can't play God, son."
01:21:26.256,01:21:28.258,&lrm;It must end with me.
01:21:28.341,01:21:30.468,&lrm;Just by being here &lrm;you may be killing your mother.
01:21:31.887,01:21:33.638,"&lrm;That's bullshit, you know?"
01:21:33.721,01:21:37.559,&lrm;I'll send you a postcard &lrm;when I've made everything perfect again.
01:21:38.560,01:21:40.395,"&lrm;Ahh! No, no!"
01:21:41.271,01:21:43.106,&lrm;JASON: I love...
01:22:02.167,01:22:04.086,"&lrm;Just get out, did ya?"
01:22:04.669,01:22:05.670,&lrm;Hmm?
01:22:06.754,01:22:15.472,"&lrm;Oh, nothing, just that my brother &lrm;did a stint in the pen, &lrm;I come from a big family."
01:22:15.555,01:22:17.432,"&lrm;Well, I meant no offense."
01:22:19.142,01:22:20.393,&lrm;None taken.
01:22:20.893,01:22:22.270,"&lrm;Hey, uh..."
01:22:23.355,01:22:24.982,&lrm;Does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
01:22:25.815,01:22:26.858,&lrm;Hmm...
01:22:26.942,01:22:28.610,&lrm;I'm sorry. I never heard of her.
01:22:46.086,01:22:49.506,&lrm;GEORGE: God! Can't a man get a little &lrm;goddamn peace in his own house?
01:22:54.052,01:22:55.803,&lrm;I don't suppose &lrm;you're here to sell cookies?
01:23:00.100,01:23:01.809,"&lrm;Remember me, huh?"
01:23:02.310,01:23:04.521,&lrm;We had a nice chat once when I was seven.
01:23:06.564,01:23:08.525,&lrm;I got one question for you.
01:23:08.608,01:23:10.027,&lrm;Where can I find your daughter?
01:23:24.249,01:23:25.667,&lrm;WOMAN: Goddamn liar!
01:23:26.584,01:23:28.420,&lrm;Goddamn liar!
01:23:44.519,01:23:46.979,"&lrm;Oh, I thought you were someone else."
01:23:51.443,01:23:53.361,"&lrm;Make it fast, I'm expecting someone."
01:23:55.988,01:23:58.866,&lrm;Hey. It's good to see you.
01:24:00.535,01:24:02.204,&lrm;Can I come in?
01:24:02.287,01:24:06.124,"&lrm;If I knew you were coming, I would have &lrm;cleaned the stains off the sheets."
01:24:13.256,01:24:14.299,&lrm;What do you want?
01:24:15.717,01:24:17.135,&lrm;I just needed to see a friendly face.
01:24:17.260,01:24:18.303,&lrm;Oh.
01:24:18.386,01:24:21.223,"&lrm;Well, time is money, Evan."
01:24:23.100,01:24:24.726,&lrm;Money.
01:24:25.810,01:24:28.480,"&lrm;I guess I can spare 10 minutes &lrm;for an old friend, right?"
01:24:30.107,01:24:32.650,"&lrm;So, how's tricks?"
01:24:32.734,01:24:34.944,"&lrm;Sorry, occupational humor."
01:24:35.027,01:24:36.321,&lrm;I got it.
01:24:37.864,01:24:38.948,&lrm;You can stop now.
01:24:39.532,01:24:40.533,&lrm;Oh.
01:24:41.033,01:24:42.327,&lrm;Sorry.
01:24:42.410,01:24:45.997,"&lrm;Does my line of work &lrm;make you uncomfortable, precious?"
01:24:46.081,01:24:49.917,"&lrm;No, just that you felt like &lrm;you had to use it to hurt me."
01:24:53.546,01:24:54.922,&lrm;I've been where you've been.
01:24:57.884,01:24:58.885,&lrm;Where is that?
01:25:00.595,01:25:03.055,&lrm;You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
01:25:03.140,01:25:08.728,"&lrm;And I know people always say that, &lrm;that you wouldn't believe me, &lrm;but in this case &lrm;it's not even worth trying, so..."
01:25:11.398,01:25:13.358,&lrm;EVAN: Nothing else mattered.
01:25:13.441,01:25:15.693,&lrm;I knew I needed to find you.
01:25:15.777,01:25:19.697,&lrm;So I went over to your dad's &lrm;and made him tell me where you were.
01:25:21.908,01:25:23.785,"&lrm;You're right, Evan, I don't believe you."
01:25:23.868,01:25:25.120,&lrm;I never thought you would.
01:25:26.996,01:25:30.750,&lrm;That's why I never bothered to tell a soul &lrm;until now and I never will again.
01:25:30.833,01:25:32.835,&lrm;I'm the only person you've told?
01:25:34.129,01:25:35.463,&lrm;That's a great line.
01:25:36.339,01:25:37.757,&lrm;Does that make other girls wet?
01:25:38.841,01:25:41.386,&lrm;Do they actually eat up that bullshit?
01:25:44.013,01:25:47.475,"&lrm;You know, I could give a shit &lrm;whether you believe me or not."
01:25:48.560,01:25:51.438,"&lrm;Frankly, I'm too tired to prove it to you."
01:25:51.521,01:25:53.565,"&lrm;Oh, there's proof now, huh?"
01:25:55.358,01:25:57.985,&lrm;How else would I know &lrm;you have twin moles on your inner thigh?
01:25:58.486,01:26:00.822,&lrm;Anyone with 50 bucks could tell you that.
01:26:00.905,01:26:02.740,&lrm;Okay.
01:26:02.824,01:26:04.909,&lrm;Forget that.
01:26:04.992,01:26:09.789,&lrm;How about the fact that you prefer &lrm;the smell of skunk to flowers?
01:26:09.872,01:26:16.629,"&lrm;Or that you hate cilantro &lrm;because for some reason unknown to you, &lrm;it reminds you of your stepsister?"
01:26:16.713,01:26:20.425,"&lrm;Or that when you have an orgasm, &lrm;your toes go numb?"
01:26:20.508,01:26:22.719,&lrm;I'm sure all of your clientele &lrm;are privy to that.
01:26:26.431,01:26:28.057,&lrm;You know?
01:26:28.140,01:26:29.559,"&lrm;Look, I just thought you should know."
01:26:30.560,01:26:32.019,&lrm;Know what?
01:26:32.854,01:26:37.275,&lrm;That you were happy once with me.
01:26:39.652,01:26:42.614,"&lrm;You know, there's one &lrm;major hole in your story."
01:26:42.697,01:26:48.370,"&lrm;There's no fucking way &lrm;on this planet or any other, &lrm;I would ever be in some fucking sorority!"
01:26:53.040,01:26:55.960,"&lrm;-You were happy there. &lrm;-Oh, you're crying?"
01:26:56.043,01:26:58.755,&lrm;You sure you don't want your wallet?
01:26:58.838,01:27:00.882,"&lrm;No, I don't need it where I'm going."
01:27:00.965,01:27:03.676,"&lrm;What, are you off to change &lrm;everyone else's life again? Is that it?"
01:27:04.261,01:27:09.391,&lrm;Maybe next time &lrm;you'll pop up in some mansion &lrm;while I end up in Tijuana &lrm;doing some donkey act.
01:27:09.474,01:27:11.893,&lrm;You know what? I'm over it.
01:27:11.976,01:27:15.938,"&lrm;Every time I try to help someone, &lrm;everything just goes to shit."
01:27:16.022,01:27:18.608,"&lrm;Well, don't give up now, Slick."
01:27:18.691,01:27:20.902,"&lrm;Hell, you've already done so much for me."
01:27:20.985,01:27:25.698,&lrm;Why don't you go back in time &lrm;and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby?
01:27:26.491,01:27:31.162,&lrm;And then maybe Lenny wouldn't &lrm;freak out and ruin my family.
01:27:31.246,01:27:37.752,"&lrm;No, go back to when I was seven &lrm;and fuck me in front &lrm;of my daddy's video camera."
01:27:55.645,01:27:57.855,&lrm;You're on my bed. Get out!
01:27:57.939,01:28:01.401,"&lrm;Buddy, I thought it would be okay &lrm;what with you being sick and all."
01:28:12.537,01:28:13.996,&lrm;I'm not going to say it again.
01:28:22.046,01:28:26.175,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;The last thing I remember &lrm;before the blackout &lrm;was holding my hands &lrm;over Kayleigh's ears.
01:28:26.759,01:28:30.805,&lrm;I think I was more focused &lrm;on her hands on mine &lrm;than on the mailbox across the street.
01:28:37.979,01:28:40.231,"&lrm;Lady, stay back! &lrm;Don't go near the mailbox!"
01:28:40.815,01:28:43.610,"&lrm;-Idiots! &lrm;-I mean it, woman! Get the hell back!"
01:28:43.693,01:28:45.194,"&lrm;TOMMY: I'll save you, lady!"
01:28:53.786,01:28:56.706,&lrm;God damn it. &lrm;I thought I told you two to get out.
01:28:57.749,01:29:00.001,"&lrm;Oh, sorry, man. Did we wake you?"
01:29:02.086,01:29:04.756,"&lrm;No, it's cool."
01:29:04.839,01:29:06.007,&lrm;Okay.
01:29:32.033,01:29:33.785,&lrm;What the fuck is this?
01:29:40.750,01:29:42.919,&lrm;-ANDREA: &lrm;Please save his arm! &lrm;-EVAN: &lrm;Can you open up my locker?
01:29:43.002,01:29:45.129,&lrm;-CHILDREN: &lrm;Happy birthday! &lrm;-KAYLEIGH: &lrm;Where do you want to go now?
01:29:45.212,01:29:46.423,"&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Can I come, too?"
01:29:46.506,01:29:47.632,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: &lrm;Do you want me &lrm;to hold your popcorn?
01:29:49.050,01:29:51.928,"&lrm;Oh, my God! Evan? &lrm;Get a towel! Get a towel!"
01:29:52.011,01:29:53.971,"&lrm;Evan! Oh, my God!"
01:29:57.767,01:29:59.310,"&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Hey, where you going?"
01:29:59.393,01:30:01.896,&lrm;LENNY: &lrm;You ever notice Kayleigh's smile? &lrm;I love her smile.
01:30:01.979,01:30:03.981,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: &lrm;Lenny's the best.
01:30:04.065,01:30:05.650,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;You guys make a great couple.
01:30:05.733,01:30:07.777,&lrm;You ever think that I'll find someone?
01:30:09.821,01:30:10.947,&lrm;Evan!
01:30:16.744,01:30:18.245,"&lrm;We're taking you to the hospital, Evan."
01:30:18.329,01:30:21.123,"&lrm;-No, take me back. &lrm;-Sorry, your mom would kill me."
01:30:23.751,01:30:26.170,"&lrm;-Oh. &lrm;-You take me back, Lenny!"
01:30:28.297,01:30:29.757,&lrm;You owe me that much.
01:30:34.596,01:30:36.222,&lrm;What are you geeks looking at?
01:30:36.305,01:30:38.766,"&lrm;It must be nice to be &lrm;so goddamn perfect, huh?"
01:30:39.517,01:30:42.269,"&lrm;Fucking losers! Lenny, help me!"
01:30:42.353,01:30:44.438,"&lrm;Here, get him over. Get him over."
01:30:46.023,01:30:49.026,"&lrm;Hey, Brian, &lrm;how's your head feeling, buddy?"
01:30:49.110,01:30:51.153,&lrm;I saw that girl you went home with.
01:30:51.237,01:30:53.280,&lrm;Did she borrow your razor this morning?
01:30:53.364,01:30:54.699,&lrm;You're so bad.
01:30:56.283,01:30:59.453,"&lrm;Hey, there's Tommy. Hey, Tommy! Tommy!"
01:30:59.537,01:31:02.206,"&lrm;Hey! What's up, guys?"
01:31:03.374,01:31:05.627,"&lrm;Hey, man, I did what you said."
01:31:05.710,01:31:09.463,&lrm;We're pooling our student funds &lrm;with the Hillel House &lrm;-and we're having an awareness dance. &lrm;-EVAN: Oh.
01:31:10.715,01:31:15.469,&lrm;Awesome. Maybe I can spin my chair around &lrm;to a techno remix &lrm;of &lrm;Hava Nagila&lrm; till I puke.
01:31:17.471,01:31:18.890,&lrm;Maybe we should be getting to class now.
01:31:18.973,01:31:20.725,&lrm;What's the point of psych class now?
01:31:20.808,01:31:23.477,&lrm;Tomorrow I could wake up &lrm;a dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
01:31:24.854,01:31:27.356,&lrm;Let's go for a stroll.
01:31:27.439,01:31:28.900,"&lrm;Bye, babe."
01:31:28.983,01:31:30.902,"&lrm;-Yippee. &lrm;-Bye, sis."
01:31:32.403,01:31:35.281,"&lrm;EVAN: So, Tommy's really &lrm;into this Jesus freak thing, huh?"
01:31:35.364,01:31:39.786,&lrm;You know how spiritual he's gotten &lrm;ever since he saved &lrm;Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
01:31:41.412,01:31:42.830,&lrm;He saved Mrs. Halpern?
01:31:44.123,01:31:46.208,&lrm;Please. The twisted fuck.
01:31:47.710,01:31:49.796,"&lrm;KAYLEIGH: Here, why don't we &lrm;sit right here?"
01:31:57.845,01:31:59.221,&lrm;Want a granola bar?
01:32:02.099,01:32:03.560,"&lrm;Here, just..."
01:32:07.689,01:32:10.024,"&lrm;Yeah, I gotta fix &lrm;these things or something."
01:32:13.110,01:32:14.612,&lrm;Kayleigh.
01:32:15.487,01:32:17.031,&lrm;Do you ever think about us?
01:32:17.114,01:32:22.954,"&lrm;I mean, do you ever wonder &lrm;if things might have been &lrm;different between us?"
01:32:23.037,01:32:24.831,"&lrm;Sure, Evan."
01:32:27.541,01:32:29.711,&lrm;You were the first person &lrm;I really ever cared about.
01:32:31.921,01:32:34.340,&lrm;-I was? &lrm;-Yeah.
01:32:35.549,01:32:38.803,"&lrm;That's why when I was little, &lrm;I never went to live with my mother."
01:32:40.262,01:32:42.056,&lrm;I don't get it.
01:32:42.139,01:32:47.394,"&lrm;When my folks split up, &lrm;they gave me and Tommy a choice &lrm;of who we wanted to live with."
01:32:47.478,01:32:50.189,&lrm;And I couldn't stand my dad.
01:32:50.272,01:32:54.485,"&lrm;But I knew that &lrm;if I went to move with my mom, &lrm;I'd never see you again."
01:32:56.070,01:32:57.488,&lrm;I didn't know that.
01:32:59.406,01:33:03.745,"&lrm;So, you still think about us together?"
01:33:06.247,01:33:09.751,"&lrm;Well, it's crossed my mind &lrm;from time to time."
01:33:12.378,01:33:14.756,"&lrm;Well, a lot of things &lrm;have crossed my mind, Ev."
01:33:14.839,01:33:18.885,"&lrm;I mean, I could play out the entire movie &lrm;of our lives in one second."
01:33:18.968,01:33:22.013,"&lrm;Boom, we fall in love, we get married. &lrm;We have kids."
01:33:22.096,01:33:25.099,"&lrm;Our kids grow old, as do we."
01:33:25.182,01:33:27.601,"&lrm;Matching burial plots, the whole thing."
01:33:29.103,01:33:32.148,"&lrm;Plah, it took a lot longer to spit out &lrm;than to imagine."
01:33:34.108,01:33:36.443,&lrm;Things like that usually do.
01:33:38.946,01:33:40.072,&lrm;So...
01:33:40.990,01:33:42.784,&lrm;Do you think that it might have worked?
01:33:42.867,01:33:44.493,&lrm;Yeah.
01:33:46.954,01:33:49.791,"&lrm;I mean, but that's &lrm;not how things wound up."
01:33:51.375,01:33:52.752,&lrm;I'm with Lenny.
01:33:55.087,01:33:56.881,&lrm;Lenny is your friend.
01:33:59.466,01:34:01.510,&lrm;And that's where it ends.
01:34:03.763,01:34:04.972,&lrm;Well...
01:34:06.891,01:34:13.898,&lrm;Would it make a difference if I told you &lrm;that no one could possibly &lrm;ever love anyone as much as I love you?
01:34:22.990,01:34:26.285,"&lrm;You know, I'm not saying that. I..."
01:34:26.368,01:34:34.626,"&lrm;-Yeah. Mmm. &lrm;-I'm not... I'm just saying it like &lrm;if you were a girl, &lrm;would that be something &lrm;that you would want to hear?"
01:34:39.006,01:34:40.800,&lrm;Hold on one second. Lenny's calling.
01:34:40.883,01:34:42.676,"&lrm;I'll be right back, Ev, okay?"
01:34:49.141,01:34:51.018,&lrm;He's a little down. He'll be all right.
01:34:52.019,01:34:53.020,&lrm;LENNY: All right.
01:35:48.910,01:35:49.911,&lrm;Oh...
01:35:50.119,01:35:52.746,&lrm;You forgot to put &lrm;the toaster on the ledge.
01:35:53.790,01:35:55.416,&lrm;Lenny likes Pop-Tarts.
01:35:57.501,01:35:59.170,&lrm;You guys are all that matter now.
01:36:01.755,01:36:03.925,"&lrm;Man, I know it's hard, &lrm;but you can't give up."
01:36:05.217,01:36:06.886,&lrm;I can't even fucking kill myself.
01:36:06.969,01:36:08.595,"&lrm;Oh, don't talk like that."
01:36:19.106,01:36:21.525,"&lrm;All right, I've got &lrm;to get you out of here."
01:36:21.608,01:36:23.277,&lrm;Visiting hours are almost over.
01:36:27.781,01:36:29.951,&lrm;Did Mom get transferred again?
01:36:30.492,01:36:33.204,&lrm;What are you talking about? &lrm;She's been here the entire time.
01:36:50.387,01:36:51.513,&lrm;EVAN: Lung cancer?
01:36:52.473,01:36:55.517,&lrm;You started chain smoking &lrm;when I blew myself up.
01:36:55.601,01:36:57.811,"&lrm;Sorry, Mrs. T, &lrm;he's been acting out of sorts lately."
01:36:59.021,01:37:00.231,&lrm;Mom.
01:37:00.314,01:37:02.816,&lrm;You're going to be okay. I can change it.
01:37:03.359,01:37:06.112,"&lrm;Um, maybe... I'm gonna go &lrm;down to the chapel."
01:37:12.076,01:37:15.204,&lrm;just like your father.
01:37:15.829,01:37:18.249,&lrm;I'm going to get you out of here. Okay?
01:37:18.332,01:37:19.333,&lrm;No.
01:37:21.752,01:37:22.836,&lrm;I'm going to fix it.
01:37:23.921,01:37:25.006,&lrm;No.
01:37:26.465,01:37:28.300,"&lrm;No, no."
01:37:32.054,01:37:33.639,&lrm;LENNY: Are you sure you even packed it?
01:37:33.722,01:37:35.516,&lrm;EVAN: My mom packed it.
01:37:35.599,01:37:37.643,&lrm;I think she sent everything I ever owned.
01:37:37.726,01:37:39.520,&lrm;-Is this it? &lrm;-Yeah.
01:37:39.645,01:37:41.355,&lrm;What do you want it for? &lrm;I don't get you lately.
01:37:42.023,01:37:43.190,&lrm;Duly noted.
01:37:47.111,01:37:48.654,"&lrm;Okay, I have to ask you one last favor."
01:37:48.737,01:37:50.531,&lrm;-What? &lrm;-I need you to be quiet.
01:37:51.282,01:37:53.700,&lrm;I have to concentrate &lrm;if I wanna destroy the blockbuster.
01:37:53.784,01:38:00.291,"&lrm;-What? What, the blockbuster? &lrm;-If I hadn't blown off my arms, &lrm;my mom would've never &lrm;started smoking in the first place."
01:38:01.042,01:38:02.793,&lrm;Never mind. Just open it.
01:38:04.921,01:38:07.464,&lrm;Turn it. There.
01:38:12.803,01:38:16.390,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;Today Mommy is taking me to play &lrm;with Kayleigh and Tommy.
01:38:16.890,01:38:19.893,&lrm;I will meet their father &lrm;and see what a real dad is like.
01:38:23.230,01:38:25.566,"&lrm;Now, how do I destroy the blockbuster?"
01:38:40.747,01:38:43.709,"&lrm;Evan, what are you doing with that knife?"
01:38:47.921,01:38:51.633,"&lrm;Well, that didn't work. Go on, turn it."
01:38:53.260,01:38:54.761,&lrm;Turn it. There.
01:38:56.597,01:38:59.058,"&lrm;I never wanted &lrm;to be in the movie, anyway."
01:38:59.141,01:39:01.727,"&lrm;And I was cold, &lrm;so I wanted to wear my clothes."
01:39:01.810,01:39:03.770,&lrm;But Mr. Miller took my shirt off.
01:39:03.854,01:39:09.401,"&lrm;GEORGE: In this part of the story, &lrm;Robin Hood has just married Maid Marian."
01:39:09.485,01:39:14.198,"&lrm;And they have to kiss and stuff, &lrm;like grown-ups do."
01:39:14.281,01:39:15.992,"&lrm;Wait, I need my belt."
01:39:23.457,01:39:26.043,"&lrm;GEORGE: Hey, don't even bother &lrm;about a belt."
01:39:26.918,01:39:29.630,"&lrm;-Hey. &lrm;-Back off, fuckbag."
01:39:29.713,01:39:32.466,&lrm;Amazing that word never fails &lrm;to make an impression with you.
01:39:34.218,01:39:35.761,"&lrm;Easy does it, Evan."
01:39:35.844,01:39:40.599,&lrm;Don't be a bad boy &lrm;or I'll tell your mother &lrm;what a naughty little shit you are.
01:39:40.682,01:39:44.561,&lrm;And I'll tell Child Protective Services &lrm;about your little kiddie porn endeavors.
01:39:45.312,01:39:47.398,&lrm;One step closer &lrm;and I'll shove this up your ass.
01:39:47.481,01:39:49.900,"&lrm;Hey, that's dangerous. &lrm;You could blow off your hands."
01:39:49.983,01:39:51.443,"&lrm;Been there, done that."
01:39:54.655,01:39:55.656,&lrm;GEORGE: Hey.
01:39:59.826,01:40:01.078,"&lrm;-Sparkler. &lrm;-Kayleigh, no!"
01:40:02.246,01:40:04.540,"&lrm;No! Kayleigh, no!"
01:40:12.173,01:40:13.340,"&lrm;Hey, man."
01:40:15.884,01:40:17.428,"&lrm;ANDREA: &lrm;Good, kiddo."
01:40:17.511,01:40:20.264,&lrm;MAN 1: &lrm;I've got no choice but to commit &lrm;you to Sunnyvale Institution...
01:40:20.347,01:40:22.558,"&lrm;ANDREA: &lrm;Evan, you're gonna have &lrm;to live somewhere else for a while."
01:40:22.641,01:40:24.101,&lrm;-MAN: &lrm;A squashed butterfly. &lrm;-EVAN: &lrm;Where's my mommy?
01:40:24.185,01:40:25.977,&lrm;I'm so sick of this!
01:40:26.062,01:40:27.604,&lrm;MAN 2: &lrm;Maybe we should up your medication.
01:40:27.688,01:40:29.356,&lrm;EVAN: &lrm;I have my medication.
01:40:57.843,01:40:59.136,&lrm;Where are my goddamn books?
01:40:59.220,01:41:02.848,"&lrm;Hey, Evan, we're not supposed &lrm;to meet for another hour."
01:41:02.931,01:41:05.142,&lrm;Where are my goddamn books?
01:41:05.226,01:41:06.893,&lrm;Books?
01:41:08.270,01:41:11.815,&lrm;My journals. I need them.
01:41:11.898,01:41:15.986,"&lrm;So, if you'd give 'em to me, &lrm;it'd help a lot."
01:41:16.069,01:41:18.822,&lrm;It really hurts me &lrm;to go through this again.
01:41:19.240,01:41:20.532,&lrm;There are no journals.
01:41:21.575,01:41:23.410,&lrm;There never were.
01:41:23.494,01:41:28.874,&lrm;It's part of the fantasy world &lrm;that your mind created &lrm;to cope with the guilt &lrm;of killing Kayleigh Miller.
01:41:30.041,01:41:32.043,"&lrm;Think, Evan, think."
01:41:32.961,01:41:35.422,&lrm;You've created a disease &lrm;that does not exist.
01:41:36.548,01:41:41.094,&lrm;Alternate universes with colleges &lrm;and prisons and paraplegia.
01:41:41.178,01:41:44.140,&lrm;I want my journals and I want 'em now!
01:41:44.223,01:41:47.184,&lrm;And I know that you got 'em &lrm;and you're gonna give 'em to me!
01:41:47.268,01:41:49.603,&lrm;You're not going to hide them from me. &lrm;I want them!
01:41:51.688,01:41:54.441,&lrm;You're reminding me of your father.
01:41:54.525,01:41:57.861,&lrm;He was always screaming for a photo album &lrm;even though he never had one.
01:41:59.905,01:42:01.407,&lrm;I'm so sorry.
01:42:05.744,01:42:07.913,&lrm;A photo album?
01:42:07.996,01:42:09.206,&lrm;Photos.
01:42:09.290,01:42:10.541,&lrm;Evan?
01:42:14.127,01:42:16.129,&lrm;The damage is irreparable.
01:42:21.760,01:42:24.763,"&lrm;Frankly, I'm surprised he still &lrm;has use of his motor functions."
01:42:34.815,01:42:35.816,&lrm;Mom?
01:42:37.193,01:42:38.735,&lrm;Um...
01:42:38.819,01:42:42.448,&lrm;Did you remember to bring &lrm;those home movies that we used to make?
01:42:43.865,01:42:45.951,"&lrm;Yeah, they're right here."
01:42:47.160,01:42:50.997,"&lrm;Good, because I really like to watch them."
01:42:55.001,01:42:56.253,"&lrm;So, that's good."
01:43:01.675,01:43:05.011,&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: I think it's best &lrm;we transfer him to Bellevue &lrm;first thing in the morning.
01:43:48.221,01:43:58.399,"&lrm;If anyone finds this, &lrm;it means that my plan didn't work &lrm;and I'm already dead."
01:44:00.734,01:44:02.861,&lrm;He's not in his room. Search the grounds.
01:44:02.944,01:44:08.867,&lrm;If I can somehow go back &lrm;-to the beginning of all of this... &lrm;-DR. REDFIELD: Check across the hall.
01:44:08.950,01:44:13.455,&lrm;-Evan! &lrm;-I might be able to save her.
01:44:13.872,01:44:15.081,&lrm;DR. REDFIELD: Evan!
01:44:17.250,01:44:19.002,&lrm;MAN: Over here. Evan!
01:44:26.427,01:44:27.678,&lrm;-What's your name? &lrm;-Kayleigh.
01:44:27.761,01:44:28.762,&lrm;This is Evan.
01:44:30.681,01:44:32.140,"&lrm;MAN 2: Evan, come on out!"
01:44:38.188,01:44:39.940,&lrm;-EVAN: &lrm;Hi. &lrm;-ANDREA: &lrm;Go on.
01:44:54.746,01:44:59.585,"&lrm;I hate you, &lrm;and if you ever come near me again, &lrm;I'll kill you and your whole damn family."
01:45:06.257,01:45:08.218,"&lrm;MRS. MILLER: What happened, sweetie? &lrm;What's wrong?"
01:45:10.471,01:45:11.472,&lrm;Goodbye.
01:45:18.061,01:45:19.062,&lrm;KAYLEIGH: &lrm;Sparkler.
01:45:19.145,01:45:20.146,&lrm;MAN: &lrm;Evan?
01:45:24.651,01:45:25.861,"&lrm;MRS. MILLER: &lrm;Kayleigh, Tommy!"
01:45:27.153,01:45:28.238,&lrm;I missed you.
01:45:28.321,01:45:30.741,&lrm;I'll never let you guys &lrm;out of my sight again.
01:45:31.908,01:45:32.909,&lrm;TOMMY: &lrm;Here we go.
01:45:34.244,01:45:38.499,"&lrm;True happiness can only be &lrm;achieved through sacrifice, &lrm;like the sacrifices our parents &lrm;have made for us to be here today."
01:45:39.124,01:45:40.125,&lrm;Whoo!
01:45:46.214,01:45:47.340,&lrm;Are you all right?
01:45:49.885,01:45:51.136,&lrm;Where's Kayleigh?
01:45:51.219,01:45:52.679,&lrm;Who's Kayleigh?
01:45:54.515,01:45:56.182,&lrm;Who's Kayleigh?
01:45:59.936,01:46:01.480,&lrm;Who's Kayleigh?
01:46:01.897,01:46:03.273,&lrm;Do you want me to take you to the doctor?
01:46:03.940,01:46:04.941,&lrm;No.
01:46:12.741,01:46:13.742,&lrm;No.
01:46:14.785,01:46:17.829,&lrm;I think everything's &lrm;going to be all right this time.
01:46:32.636,01:46:34.220,&lrm;You sure about this?
01:46:36.723,01:46:38.224,&lrm;I know who I am.
01:46:38.725,01:46:41.394,&lrm;I don't need a bunch of stuff &lrm;to remind me.
01:47:03.208,01:47:05.335,&lrm;I'm just running a little late.
01:47:05.418,01:47:07.337,"&lrm;Yeah, I had to &lrm;finish up with the patients."
01:47:09.465,01:47:11.883,"&lrm;Well, get the soup or something."
01:47:11.967,01:47:13.677,"&lrm;All right. Love you, Mom."
01:47:14.427,01:47:15.762,&lrm;Bye-bye.
