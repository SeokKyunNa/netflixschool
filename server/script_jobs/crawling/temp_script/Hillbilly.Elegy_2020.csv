00:00:39.250,00:00:47.708,"Yet for some of us, the American dream, the singular hope of our people, remains ever out of reach."
00:00:54.791,00:01:06.916,"even in our God… And though others may scorn our beliefs, let us hold faith not only in that God, but in ourselves and our character."
00:01:13.458,00:01:19.458,"be this flight generations in the making, be it delayed so long our faith is bound."
00:01:20.708,00:01:22.666,Let that faith never be broken.
00:01:41.083,00:01:46.375,"I say Ohio 'cause that's where I lived most of my life, but that's only part of my story."
00:01:48.583,00:01:53.833,"Ask me where I feel most at home, that's the hill country, Jackson, Kentucky."
00:01:57.541,00:02:00.125,Down those hollers is where I spent every summer.
00:02:00.750,00:02:03.166,Hands down the best part of my childhood.
00:02:04.000,00:02:05.833,It's where my people come from.
00:02:07.000,00:02:08.000,Whoa.
00:02:11.000,00:02:11.833,Hey.
00:02:25.291,00:02:26.708,-Hey. -Hey.
00:02:29.791,00:02:30.916,What you got there?
00:02:31.708,00:02:34.833,"It's a, uh… it's a turtle. See?"
00:02:38.916,00:02:42.833,It can't live without his shell. Ribcage is fused to the carapace.
00:02:55.375,00:02:57.416,I told Kevin we'd be home by 1:00.
00:02:57.500,00:03:01.125,"-Hey, old woman. You packed? -What's your rush, Bev? Got a hot date?"
00:03:01.208,00:03:04.791,"Yeah, with not being bored off my ass. Next time I'll bring Chip."
00:03:04.875,00:03:07.541,"No, you ain't. We don't need that drama here."
00:03:07.625,00:03:08.541,Just get your stuff!
00:03:09.125,00:03:12.250,Perch and swivel. I'll go when I'm ready.
00:03:16.208,00:03:18.625,-Where's your brother at? -He rode off.
00:03:18.708,00:03:21.375,You couldn't keep an eye on him for two seconds?
00:04:06.083,00:04:09.583,but Mamaw and Papaw taught me that you never start a fight.
00:04:10.125,00:04:13.625,"But if someone starts one with you, make damn sure you end it."
00:04:25.875,00:04:27.083,Get off him!
00:04:32.750,00:04:35.666,-Get off him! -What the hell you think you're doing?
00:04:35.750,00:04:36.708,You son of a bitch.
00:04:36.791,00:04:41.500,"I oughta put my foot up your ass so far, you gonna have hemorrhoids for ten years."
00:04:41.583,00:04:43.833,"-You Hugh McCall's boy? -Eat shit, old man."
00:04:47.083,00:04:48.916,Get your ass outta here before I call your pa.
00:04:50.125,00:04:51.166,Freak.
00:05:00.416,00:05:01.875,What happened to you?
00:05:04.583,00:05:11.000,"Of all the lamebrain ways to get out of going home… -Who did that? I'll kill him. -Mom, come on."
00:05:11.083,00:05:13.000,I'll kill him. Give me a name. C'mon.
00:05:13.083,00:05:16.083,Hugh McCall's boy and a couple other little assholes.
00:05:16.166,00:05:18.791,"That McCall boy had an idea, it'd die of loneliness."
00:05:18.875,00:05:20.500,-Will you get him some ice? -Yup!
00:05:20.583,00:05:24.791,Did you tell them dickhead bastards the three of them ain't worth one Vance?
00:05:28.500,00:05:31.208,"-Are you all right? -I'm all right, Mom."
00:05:31.291,00:05:33.416,-Are you sure? -Yeah.
00:05:39.208,00:05:43.083,Whoo! And dry off! I ain't sitting next to that for three hours!
00:05:49.500,00:05:53.250,"Let's get the family picture 'fore we go. Bev, get over here."
00:05:53.333,00:05:55.375,"God forbid, we get on the road before noon."
00:05:59.000,00:06:02.916,"I want the sisters together. Everybody, look at the camera. C'mon."
00:06:16.750,00:06:18.000,"C'mon, let's go."
00:06:18.083,00:06:20.458,I've had about all the Kentucky I can take.
00:06:25.708,00:06:28.666,Why can't we stay longer? We're always the first ones to leave.
00:06:28.750,00:06:30.708,I don't get why you ever left Jackson.
00:06:30.791,00:06:34.291,"'Cause when you're knocked up at 13, you get the hell out of Dodge. That's why."
00:06:52.875,00:07:01.250,"Imagining Mamaw at almost my same age just running, pregnant, from everything she knew, every scrap of family she had."
00:07:03.666,00:07:13.416,"I felt like I'd stumbled onto something. A puzzle piece, an answer to a question I had barely begun to ask about our family and what became of us."
00:08:54.291,00:08:56.583,"Oh, thank God. Back to civilization."
00:09:02.041,00:09:04.250,I wouldn't call Middletown civilization.
00:09:13.083,00:09:14.958,"Bev, give me some of them ribs."
00:09:16.041,00:09:18.291,His no-good mother behind the curtains.
00:09:18.375,00:09:21.583,Wouldn't spit on her ass if her guts were on fire.
00:09:27.333,00:09:30.041,All right. You take that home.
00:09:30.583,00:09:32.583,-All right. -Thank you.
00:09:37.083,00:09:40.208,I'm gonna head on down to my place. See ya tomorrow.
00:10:28.208,00:10:29.458,they never caught it.
00:10:30.458,00:10:33.250,We were all different in Middletown somehow.
00:10:34.166,00:10:36.250,"I don't know, like something was missing."
00:10:36.875,00:10:38.125,Maybe hope.
00:11:09.083,00:11:10.583,-Paycheck. -Sorry. Thanks.
00:11:11.083,00:11:17.458,"You couldn't get to Yale on Route 23, but I'd come closer than any of 'em to that dream of something better."
00:11:17.541,00:11:20.208,I could see it right there in front of me.
00:11:20.958,00:11:24.375,But a part of me knew the road from here to there is rocky.
00:11:35.958,00:11:37.583,"-Eat it. -No, I have to study."
00:11:37.666,00:11:40.666,"-Usha, you have to eat. -They'll boot me if they see food in here."
00:11:42.083,00:11:44.375,I'll cover for you. Come on.
00:11:53.125,00:11:54.916,Put it away! They know! They're coming!
00:11:55.000,00:11:56.250,-Okay. -The cameras!
00:12:04.291,00:12:06.750,"No, I have a dinner tonight."
00:12:09.666,00:12:11.833,-Are you nervous? What's going on? -No.
00:12:11.916,00:12:15.208,I'm going to shine up against the triple Ivy League types.
00:12:15.291,00:12:18.916,"If you're desperate, talk about the Hatfield-McCoy thing."
00:12:21.041,00:12:22.125,This is ridiculous.
00:12:22.208,00:12:25.375,"Hey. You're gonna get this, okay?"
00:12:25.458,00:12:29.458,I have to 'cause I'm not letting you go to D.C. without me.
00:12:30.000,00:12:31.916,I don't want to be there without you.
00:12:40.458,00:12:41.916,I have a meeting.
00:12:42.000,00:12:43.958,-Mm. -But I love you.
00:12:46.666,00:12:47.958,I love you.
00:12:48.041,00:12:49.541,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:12:50.250,00:12:51.458,I love you back.
00:12:55.833,00:12:56.750,Thanks.
00:13:06.541,00:13:08.916,So you got your aid package for next year?
00:13:09.791,00:13:12.541,"Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about that."
00:13:13.083,00:13:15.541,I know. It's not as much as the first year.
00:13:15.625,00:13:19.958,"Jill, I'm working three jobs. I still can't afford $21,000."
00:13:21.333,00:13:22.750,How's firm week going?
00:13:23.333,00:13:31.625,"It's going. I got a callback, a dinner tonight, interviews tomorrow-- The standard salary for a summer associate is well over $30,000."
00:13:31.708,00:13:34.875,If I get the job. What if I don't?
00:13:34.958,00:13:37.125,I'm looking for a contingency plan.
00:13:37.750,00:13:39.000,Is there one?
00:13:39.833,00:13:41.875,I'd do more for you if I could.
00:13:43.333,00:13:45.708,"You're gonna get one of these jobs, J.D."
00:13:46.291,00:13:47.708,I'm sure of it.
00:13:53.333,00:13:56.083,"but I could also see myself going the firm route, as well."
00:13:56.166,00:13:59.125,Makes perfect sense. Keep your options open.
00:14:00.125,00:14:02.041,Let's introduce you around.
00:14:02.125,00:14:04.708,Perfect. There's actually someone I was hoping to meet.
00:14:04.791,00:14:07.000,Holly! You made it!
00:14:07.083,00:14:09.000,"Brooks! Yes, I did."
00:14:12.625,00:14:19.083,"I had the opportunity to meet with all the top firms, so I would consider something… Excuse me."
00:14:19.833,00:14:21.041,Call me Tuesday.
00:14:22.250,00:14:23.416,"Care for wine, sir?"
00:14:24.625,00:14:27.208,Have some. They're serving the good stuff.
00:14:27.291,00:14:28.208,Red or white?
00:14:28.291,00:14:29.458,White is fine.
00:14:29.541,00:14:32.083,Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc?
00:14:35.333,00:14:36.375,Try the Chardonnay.
00:14:38.708,00:14:54.375,"-Thank you. -You were saying… Um, so, my girlfriend has a summer position in D.C., and I was hoping to talk to Phillip Roseman -because his firm-- -There he is right there."
00:14:54.458,00:14:55.875,Tall guy with the glasses.
00:14:57.500,00:15:00.000,Remind me. Where did you go for undergrad?
00:15:00.083,00:15:03.166,-Ohio State. -Right. Plenty of great state schools.
00:15:21.583,00:15:24.583,"So litigation, pretty big transition."
00:15:24.666,00:15:25.833,Is this seat taken?
00:15:26.875,00:15:27.708,Go ahead.
00:15:29.708,00:15:30.666,Phillip Roseman.
00:15:31.458,00:15:33.875,"Uh, J.D. Vance. Thanks."
00:15:34.916,00:15:38.000,That's the thing to do. That's what I did my first summer.
00:15:50.375,00:15:51.958,You on the Journal?
00:15:52.541,00:15:54.791,"-No, I didn't get in this time. -Too bad."
00:15:55.875,00:16:00.083,"-I'm gonna try again, though. -Lot of firms won't touch you without it."
00:16:00.666,00:16:02.583,"Yes, sir. That's what I've heard."
00:16:05.916,00:16:07.875,Will you excuse me? I'm sorry.
00:16:14.625,00:16:15.458,J.D.?
00:16:15.541,00:16:17.583,Why are there so many fuckin' forks?
00:16:17.666,00:16:20.291,"Usha, what am I supposed to do with all these forks?"
00:16:20.791,00:16:24.250,They had two different kinds of white wine. It's like a test.
00:16:25.333,00:16:28.041,Next time just say you'll have whatever's driest.
00:16:29.541,00:16:32.875,"Listen, use the silverware from the outside in."
00:16:32.958,00:16:36.125,"If the knife has a funny edge, it's for fish."
00:16:36.208,00:16:41.208,"If the spoon's too big, it's for soup, and the spoon at the top, that's for dessert."
00:16:41.291,00:16:45.666,Try this: put your first finger and your thumb together on each hand.
00:16:49.750,00:16:53.666,You have D for drink on the right and B for bread on the left.
00:16:54.416,00:16:56.083,-Got it? -Okay.
00:16:56.166,00:16:57.916,Now put your hands up to your eyes.
00:17:00.166,00:17:03.333,"-Now what? -Oh, my God. You actually did it?"
00:17:04.583,00:17:07.791,"Oh, my God. I'm such an idiot. Why are you with me?"
00:17:07.875,00:17:12.458,"Well, because you're not a douchebag and you don't know how to use forks."
00:17:12.541,00:17:16.000,You got a callback at the best firm. Are you registering that?
00:17:16.875,00:17:18.541,"It's just a dinner, right?"
00:17:18.625,00:17:22.958,"Just a dinner, piece of cake. Thank you, spirit guide."
00:17:23.583,00:17:27.625,"-Ah, don't mention it. Okay, bye. -Bye."
00:17:32.000,00:17:35.166,"Jesus, Linds. What is it? I'm at a dinner interview thing."
00:17:37.541,00:17:39.625,She's in the hospital.
00:17:39.708,00:17:41.875,"Well, is she okay? What happened?"
00:17:42.708,00:17:44.125,She started using again.
00:17:46.541,00:17:48.958,I can't do this right now.
00:17:49.041,00:17:50.166,Heroin.
00:17:51.541,00:17:52.500,What?
00:17:54.083,00:17:55.500,She OD'd.
00:18:02.166,00:18:05.750,"'Class, this is a tadpole,' said Mr. Shepherd."
00:18:05.833,00:18:07.625,What do you think a tadpole becomes?
00:18:30.958,00:18:32.208,Mom?
00:18:55.375,00:18:56.541,Did I do something?
00:19:20.791,00:19:22.708,"Yes, sir. I'm fine. Thank you."
00:19:23.208,00:19:25.708,Did you meet Rich and Pamela?
00:19:27.500,00:19:30.000,"-Great to meet you, J.D. -Good to meet you, sir."
00:19:33.958,00:19:37.416,from Harvard Business School grad to Yale law student.
00:19:38.291,00:19:40.541,So… what's your story?
00:19:40.625,00:19:43.833,"Well, I'm from Ohio, but my family is from Kentucky."
00:19:43.916,00:19:45.208,"-Bluegrass State. -Yes, sir."
00:19:45.291,00:19:48.208,"I joined the Marines out of high school, served in Iraq."
00:19:48.291,00:19:49.708,-Wow. -It was a great experience.
00:19:49.791,00:19:52.375,It helped pay for college.
00:19:54.458,00:19:57.500,Then I finished up and got my degree in two years.
00:19:57.583,00:20:00.500,"So your family, were they, uh, coal miners?"
00:20:00.583,00:20:06.375,"No, actually, my grandfather went north to work at a steel plant like a lot of folks from Appalachia did."
00:20:13.666,00:20:20.791,They were actually sort of hillbilly royalty because my Papaw was related to the guy who started the Hatfield-McCoy feud.
00:20:20.875,00:20:22.000,"-Really? -Yes, ma'am."
00:20:22.083,00:20:24.666,-No kidding. -I just saw that miniseries.
00:20:26.250,00:20:27.833,What's it like when you go back?
00:20:28.791,00:20:31.750,I don't really get a lot of chances to go back.
00:20:32.625,00:20:34.833,It must feel like you're from another planet.
00:20:36.875,00:20:39.125,"Yeah, uh, you know, I guess."
00:20:43.291,00:20:45.208,We don't really use that term.
00:20:45.291,00:20:56.750,"Oh, no. Yeah, that's not at all what… It's just, you know, I mean, you're at a top educational institutions in the world-- My mother was salutatorian of her high school."
00:20:56.833,00:21:00.208,"Smartest person I've met, probably smarter than anyone in this room."
00:21:01.291,00:21:02.666,Maybe so.
00:21:02.750,00:21:05.625,"Well, I didn't mean any disrespect."
00:21:07.416,00:21:09.375,Looks like you failed on that one.
00:21:10.791,00:21:14.250,It sounds like we should be offering your mother a position.
00:21:23.291,00:21:25.875,How'd it get so bad? You had to have known.
00:21:28.500,00:21:29.916,I've got my own shit.
00:21:30.000,00:21:36.208,"Kevin's Bronco keeps breaking down, and now he's working nights and I'm the one that's got to get it fixed."
00:21:36.291,00:21:41.958,"And this dirtbag Mom's been screwing, Ray, is a junkie."
00:21:42.041,00:21:45.083,"And with Aunt Lori gone, it's all on me."
00:21:52.708,00:21:54.000,Sorry for yelling.
00:21:55.291,00:21:58.875,"-I'm sorry I haven't been there, Lindsay. -Can you come now?"
00:22:04.041,00:22:09.166,"I can't. It's Interview Week and if I'm not here, I just-- Can't you come home?"
00:22:21.708,00:22:23.708,'Cause it's what we do. That's why.
00:22:23.791,00:22:25.291,Couldn't we hide the old ones?
00:22:25.375,00:22:28.875,"At Christmas, I can rewrap your presents and put it under a fake tree."
00:22:28.958,00:22:30.041,Would you like that?
00:22:33.458,00:22:34.916,She sounds better that way.
00:22:36.208,00:22:37.416,Wiseass.
00:22:39.083,00:22:40.916,"Come on. Mom, I'm watching Gore."
00:22:45.416,00:22:46.250,I was ten.
00:22:46.333,00:22:49.333,Whatever. It's a memory and I'm gonna have it when I'm old.
00:22:52.625,00:22:53.791,What?
00:22:54.791,00:22:57.458,-It's Kevin. -I don't care if it's the baby Jesus.
00:22:57.541,00:23:00.000,"It's Easter, God damn it. Get your ass in here."
00:23:05.708,00:23:06.791,It's always Kevin.
00:23:07.916,00:23:09.500,What do you want me to do?
00:23:09.583,00:23:12.541,Blow an egg or help out with Mamaw's basket. Git!
00:23:15.083,00:23:17.583,-Be creative. What will she like? -Menthols.
00:23:28.041,00:23:30.625,I hope that's Chip. He got something for you two.
00:23:31.500,00:23:32.541,Come in! Come on.
00:23:42.541,00:23:45.541,-Jesus. How big is that thing gonna get? -He was the best one.
00:23:48.166,00:23:50.333,-What do you say? -Thank you.
00:23:50.416,00:23:51.916,Take him outside.
00:23:56.916,00:23:58.500,Get him before he pisses!
00:24:00.541,00:24:02.041,"-He's going in my room! -Oh, no."
00:24:02.125,00:24:03.958,Get him before he ruins my rug!
00:24:08.791,00:24:10.958,Bad dog. You are a bad dog!
00:24:11.041,00:24:12.875,"He does that again, I'll fucking kill him!"
00:24:19.875,00:24:23.000,He just pisses wherever the hell he wants.
00:24:32.625,00:24:34.875,"-Here's the leash. -Give me that, okay?"
00:24:34.958,00:24:37.625,"-I can take him! -Okay, but be careful."
00:24:44.166,00:24:47.041,How many times have I told you not to be so fucking careless?
00:24:47.125,00:24:48.458,-I'm sorry! -You're sorry?
00:24:48.541,00:24:50.333,I'm sorry. Go to your room!
00:24:50.916,00:24:56.416,"C'mon, babe. They're just eggs.` Oh, fuck you. Those are heirlooms. My family heirlooms."
00:25:24.291,00:25:25.208,Atog.
00:25:27.041,00:25:29.250,"How long are you gonna be mad at me, huh?"
00:25:31.750,00:25:34.291,Why didn't you tell me? Wasn't it important?
00:25:34.375,00:25:35.916,"No, you stupid bitch!"
00:25:46.916,00:25:56.208,"Sometimes I just fuck up, but… Wanna go to your favorite store?"
00:25:59.541,00:26:06.375,Get some football cards… 'Cause I'm gonna go with or without you right now.
00:26:06.458,00:26:10.583,Then it'll be me standing there staring at all those cute men in tight pants.
00:26:21.208,00:26:22.333,Who you got?
00:26:30.458,00:26:36.875,"He's a four-time Super Bowl champion, three-time MVP, All-Pro First Team three times and 117 career wins."
00:26:36.958,00:26:38.666,You sound like an automaton.
00:26:38.750,00:26:40.583,"40,551 career passing yards."
00:26:42.125,00:26:44.500,-How'd you get so smart? -I dunno.
00:26:44.583,00:26:46.375,Who do you think it came from?
00:26:48.458,00:26:50.958,-Sure. -Me! It's true.
00:26:51.041,00:26:52.791,-Okay. -You remember that.
00:26:52.875,00:26:55.916,-Whatever you say. -Joe Montana has all of that.
00:26:56.000,00:26:58.333,"But who has the best touchdown dance, huh?"
00:27:00.458,00:27:01.791,Deion.
00:27:01.875,00:27:03.000,-Mm-hmm. -Of course.
00:27:04.041,00:27:06.708,"-Mom! Mom, stop! -That's how it goes, right?"
00:27:06.791,00:27:09.250,-No! Not at all. It's like this. -Okay.
00:27:15.833,00:27:17.333,"Hey, pick those up."
00:27:22.000,00:27:23.625,Pick those up now!
00:27:23.708,00:27:24.708,He's doing it!
00:27:26.041,00:27:27.375,Just… get out!
00:27:28.416,00:27:31.000,-He hasn't bought his cards! -Get out!
00:27:31.083,00:27:32.958,"Fine! Come on, J.D."
00:27:38.500,00:27:39.500,Bitch!
00:27:43.625,00:27:45.458,Take it. Hide it.
00:27:51.500,00:27:54.166,Chip would've lost his shit if he'd been there.
00:27:57.625,00:28:00.791,Of course I'll tell him. It's too good. Come on.
00:28:01.333,00:28:02.416,"You like Chip, right?"
00:28:02.500,00:28:06.208,"Yeah, he's okay. He just… He talks about police all the time."
00:28:06.291,00:28:07.541,"Well, he's a cop."
00:28:07.625,00:28:10.958,"Yeah, but he could still talk about other stuff, I guess."
00:28:12.750,00:28:20.000,"We've been talking about moving in… to Chip's house, all of us."
00:28:21.375,00:28:25.375,"You'd have your own room, and he's got a ping-pong table."
00:28:25.458,00:28:27.166,"That'd be good, right?"
00:28:32.125,00:28:32.958,Why not?
00:28:34.375,00:28:38.333,We'd just move out again. And then we'd have to find a new place.
00:28:38.416,00:28:40.166,It's kinda what always happens.
00:28:44.500,00:28:45.333,What?
00:28:47.541,00:28:52.625,He's met a few of your boyfriends-- You let that little shit talk about your mom like that?
00:28:52.708,00:28:56.083,-I don't let him! He just said it. -After everything that I do for you?
00:29:00.583,00:29:03.041,You think I'd give these losers the time of day?
00:29:03.125,00:29:04.666,What do you think I do it for?
00:29:04.750,00:29:07.708,So you and Lindsay will have everything I never had.
00:29:08.708,00:29:10.000,You have no clue.
00:29:10.083,00:29:14.166,"I was second in my whole class, out of 400 people. Did you know that?"
00:29:14.250,00:29:23.291,"I coulda done whatever I wanted, but I didn't have somebody taking me to the library and telling me I could go to college, and gonna help me pay for it."
00:29:29.416,00:29:31.666,-I could crash. -Mom!
00:29:31.750,00:29:33.625,I could crash this car and I could kill us.
00:29:33.708,00:29:36.583,-Then you would know how lucky you are! -Stop the car please!
00:29:43.750,00:29:46.708,"-Stop! -J.D., get back in your goddamn seat!"
00:29:51.083,00:29:53.750,Quit your crying! You really think I was gonna kill us?
00:29:53.833,00:29:55.750,Chris is right! You're a bitch!
00:29:56.708,00:29:58.625,Is that what you think of your mother?
00:30:00.750,00:30:03.500,"Just look at yourself, you little fat ass!"
00:30:03.583,00:30:06.541,Yeah? You think you can say that to me?
00:30:06.625,00:30:08.458,"-You can't! -Let go of me, Mom!"
00:30:08.541,00:30:09.791,Get back here!
00:30:20.500,00:30:22.333,"J.D., you get back here!"
00:30:22.416,00:30:24.083,God damn it!
00:30:30.916,00:30:33.541,-You get out here! -Get inside quickly.
00:30:44.791,00:30:49.000,"-Hello? Mamaw, come get me! I'm at-- -11345 County Road!"
00:30:50.666,00:30:52.125,-I ain't opening the door! -Open!
00:30:52.208,00:30:53.833,Mom's losing it! Bring Papaw!
00:30:53.916,00:30:56.375,-Open the door! -You were trying to kill him!
00:30:56.458,00:30:58.166,Let me the fuck in!
00:30:59.666,00:31:01.625,-Are you kidding me? -Bring Papaw!
00:31:03.375,00:31:08.666,"-Mom! -11345 County Road! Hurry, come here now!"
00:31:09.625,00:31:12.416,-I'm gonna call Children's Services! -Go ahead and fucking do that.
00:31:14.375,00:31:16.625,Get in the fucking car! Come on!
00:31:17.375,00:31:20.208,"-Thank God you're here! -Did you call them, you bitch, huh?"
00:31:23.666,00:31:26.833,-I didn't do anything. He's a brat. -Take your hands off of the boy!
00:31:31.000,00:31:31.958,"Come on, son."
00:31:46.625,00:31:47.708,Christ.
00:31:48.750,00:31:51.458,Can y'all do something about this Wi-Fi? It's shit.
00:31:51.541,00:31:53.875,"Nah, man, it comes and it goes."
00:32:03.458,00:32:05.875,I thought you were coming over after your dinner.
00:32:05.958,00:32:09.333,"Yeah, uh, sorry about that. I sort of got sidetracked."
00:32:15.208,00:32:18.500,I don't know. I think I fucked it up pretty good.
00:32:23.000,00:32:27.166,"He deserved it, but I'm guessing that isn't what gets you a final interview."
00:32:28.833,00:32:31.083,"-J.D.? -Yeah, I'm here."
00:32:32.166,00:32:33.208,Here where?
00:32:38.125,00:32:39.125,What?
00:32:40.791,00:32:43.875,But… don't you have interviews tomorrow?
00:32:44.583,00:32:49.583,Um… My mom's in the hospital.
00:32:50.083,00:32:53.458,"Oh, my God. What happened? Is she okay?"
00:32:55.083,00:32:56.333,She's using again.
00:32:58.625,00:33:01.333,"Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, J.D."
00:33:02.166,00:33:04.166,"Yeah, I just… I gotta get back there."
00:33:05.041,00:33:07.958,"-Hey, um, do you want me to fly out? -No, please."
00:33:08.041,00:33:10.375,I can look up a flight right now.
00:33:10.458,00:33:13.375,"Usha, thank you, but you don't have to do that."
00:33:16.708,00:33:17.541,Okay.
00:33:18.958,00:33:21.666,Maybe you could ask a professor to reach out for you.
00:33:21.750,00:33:24.416,-Ask for another chance. -What are they gonna say?
00:33:25.083,00:33:28.041,"He tanked his interview, but he's from a fucked up family."
00:33:28.125,00:33:29.625,Let's give him another chance.
00:33:29.708,00:33:32.708,"Hey. Sorry, man. Your card declined."
00:33:35.333,00:33:41.333,"Really? Sorry… Um… Sorry, Usha. Can I call you back?"
00:33:41.416,00:33:45.500,Yeah. Um… Call me when you get there.
00:33:45.583,00:33:48.000,This one should work. Sorry.
00:33:51.833,00:33:55.291,"Listen, it's all going to be okay, J.D."
00:33:56.875,00:33:59.416,Just… just drive safe.
00:34:01.416,00:34:02.375,"Thanks, babe."
00:34:02.958,00:34:03.916,"Okay, bye."
00:34:04.750,00:34:05.708,Bye.
00:34:33.041,00:34:35.833,What's he doing in a cop car like a goddamn criminal?
00:34:37.666,00:34:40.416,"Well, we're here, ain't we? Get him out of there."
00:34:40.500,00:34:43.458,-I'll let him out. Everybody stay calm. -All right.
00:34:46.041,00:34:49.708,"Come here. You're all right, J.D. You're all right."
00:34:51.500,00:34:53.083,"-Let her go! -No, J.D.!"
00:34:53.166,00:34:56.125,"-Let my mom go! -Son, let me explain how this'll work."
00:34:56.208,00:34:57.875,-No! Nothing happened! -Listen to me!
00:34:57.958,00:34:59.291,Listen to me.
00:35:00.000,00:35:03.125,"This might be normal in your family, but it's not right."
00:35:03.208,00:35:04.750,Your mom's gonna need some help.
00:35:04.833,00:35:07.666,"Now, we can get it for her if you tell us what happened."
00:35:08.958,00:35:10.375,"Son, did she hit you?"
00:35:19.625,00:35:20.458,No.
00:35:22.250,00:35:23.750,She didn't do anything.
00:35:26.958,00:35:28.666,I was just being stupid.
00:35:36.375,00:35:39.125,Take 'em off. Nobody's gonna press charges.
00:35:48.625,00:35:52.125,"It's gonna be all right. You're a good boy, J.D."
00:36:06.750,00:36:10.833,"You did good to call us, son. You did good."
00:36:11.791,00:36:14.416,-Are you okay now? -I'm okay.
00:36:31.000,00:36:32.375,You're with Trish and Scott.
00:36:32.458,00:36:36.625,We are broadcasting live all day from Middletown Skateway with giveaways.
00:36:36.708,00:36:38.125,"-Right, Trish? -That's right, Scott!"
00:36:38.208,00:36:40.625,93.8's got the hookup for you.
00:36:40.708,00:37:07.000,"Twenty-five people are gonna go home with free T-shirts… -Excuse me, ma'am. -Yes?"
00:37:09.916,00:37:13.708,What rule tells you you gotta kick someone out after they almost died?
00:37:17.000,00:37:19.833,I worked at this hospital before you had zits.
00:37:25.083,00:37:29.291,-We are not asking for more than a week. -She's stable. Her vitals are normal.
00:37:32.166,00:37:33.458,"Guys, what's going on?"
00:37:33.541,00:37:35.833,"They're trying to kick Mom out, that's what's goin' on."
00:37:35.916,00:37:38.083,"Your mother's stable, ready for discharge."
00:37:43.500,00:37:46.333,Is there a facility that you set up for patients?
00:37:46.416,00:37:48.416,There are several private options in the area.
00:37:48.500,00:37:50.958,I can have the discharge planner come speak with you.
00:37:52.791,00:37:56.500,We need help to figure out what insurance will cover and what we gotta do.
00:37:56.583,00:37:58.125,Your mother doesn't have insurance.
00:37:59.916,00:38:01.125,I let it lapse.
00:38:01.708,00:38:05.416,"When I worked here, we didn't turf patients because they couldn't pay."
00:38:05.500,00:38:07.291,"Ma'am, this is the hospital's policy."
00:38:07.375,00:38:11.416,-Call Terry Cleary-- -He hasn't worked here in over ten years.
00:38:11.500,00:38:14.166,"Okay, well, call somebody who knows something!"
00:38:14.250,00:38:16.708,"-Can you call in the attending, please? -Done."
00:38:22.708,00:38:24.791,Morning. How are we all today?
00:38:24.875,00:38:30.291,"We'd be a lot better if we could figure something fuckin' out-- Can we talk out in the hallway, please?"
00:38:36.833,00:38:41.125,"I'm, uh, J.D., Beverly's son, and I'm sorry about all that, okay?"
00:38:41.208,00:38:43.958,I just got into town. I'm gonna find her a program.
00:38:44.041,00:38:48.333,"-I only need a place for one night. -Unfortunately, we don't have the beds."
00:38:48.416,00:38:52.416,The best you'll do is a Suboxone prescription for her to take home.
00:38:53.208,00:38:57.000,She doesn't… I don't know where she's going to go.
00:38:58.125,00:38:58.958,I'm sorry.
00:38:59.708,00:39:02.625,"You know she worked at this hospital for years, right?"
00:39:02.708,00:39:06.333,This is probably where this shit started with the pain pills and the bullshit.
00:39:06.416,00:39:08.166,I wish I could help you.
00:39:09.208,00:39:12.500,You have until 3:00 today. It's the best I can do.
00:39:24.375,00:39:25.625,I got us until 3:00.
00:39:27.083,00:39:30.625,"That's what your law school negotiating could get us, till 3:00."
00:39:30.708,00:39:32.333,"Oh, let's hear it for Yale."
00:39:32.416,00:39:34.750,"See you later, Mom. I'll be back to get you."
00:39:39.541,00:39:41.458,How's that fancy school anyway?
00:39:42.000,00:39:43.416,"It's fine, Mom."
00:39:44.583,00:39:46.291,Linds says you got a girlfriend.
00:39:47.916,00:39:48.958,What's her name?
00:39:49.583,00:39:52.125,"I'll be back to pick you up at 3:00, okay?"
00:39:56.000,00:39:58.791,"-Welcome home. -Gee, thanks."
00:40:00.125,00:40:02.666,-Shit. I'm late now. -For what?
00:40:02.750,00:40:07.125,One of the moms from Meghan's soccer team dumped this party on me last-minute.
00:40:09.833,00:40:11.416,and a half a pack of hot dogs.
00:40:12.250,00:40:14.583,"Sorry about this, Linds. Hello."
00:40:16.458,00:40:19.416,I'm calling from Phillip Roseman's office at Glaston Hamburg.
00:40:19.500,00:40:22.541,We'd like to invite you to a final interview tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.
00:40:27.458,00:40:31.500,But 10:00 a.m. tomorrow… Is there another time Mr. Roseman can meet me?
00:40:31.583,00:40:33.833,I'm a ten-hour drive away from New Haven.
00:40:36.208,00:40:38.750,Mr. Roseman's only in New Haven for one more day.
00:40:39.916,00:40:44.916,"Okay, 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. Uh, thank you. Bye."
00:40:47.083,00:40:49.458,-What? -Summer internship.
00:40:49.541,00:40:52.500,My final interview's tomorrow. It's the only one I got.
00:40:52.583,00:40:54.916,-I gotta be there. -One day?
00:40:56.458,00:40:58.333,-Short visit. -Yeah.
00:40:58.416,00:41:01.916,"Yeah, just about a day too long. Heroin, Lindsay? Jesus."
00:41:02.000,00:41:03.750,When did she go off a cliff?
00:41:11.458,00:41:14.291,He got the TV on too loud. I'm breaking it.
00:41:14.375,00:41:15.958,-What? -I'm breaking it.
00:41:26.833,00:41:28.958,Dad! Dad!
00:41:38.750,00:41:41.041,-It's too late. -How do you know?
00:41:41.125,00:41:44.625,"'Cause I'm a nurse, Mom. I know. He's dead."
00:42:01.416,00:42:02.583,"Yeah, I'm sure."
00:42:10.125,00:43:12.791,"Jimmy… Why do they do that, Mamaw?"
00:43:14.125,00:43:18.541,"'Cause we're hill people, honey. We respect our dead."
00:43:35.625,00:43:38.291,how Papaw had protected my mom from the world.
00:43:40.000,00:43:43.416,Now the only person who ever got her was gone.
00:43:44.958,00:43:51.875,Whatever dreams she or any of us had… they all just seemed that much further away.
00:43:54.333,00:43:56.000,"Hey, you all right, babe?"
00:44:41.000,00:44:44.250,"I give you the special treatment, Janice. You know that."
00:44:44.333,00:44:45.875,That other one sure don't.
00:44:51.583,00:44:55.000,"-Can I get you anything else? -No, I'm good."
00:45:20.541,00:45:22.666,You're back. How was the funeral?
00:45:23.208,00:45:25.625,"Oh, you know, same old family bullshit."
00:45:31.416,00:45:32.833,"Oh, my God, are those yours?"
00:45:33.375,00:45:36.041,Mm. I go after work. The parking lot is perfect for it.
00:45:36.125,00:45:51.041,"Oh, my God, I used to… Wow."
00:45:51.125,00:45:53.916,"I used to love these. You know, the roller rink."
00:45:58.791,00:46:02.041,I went dancing and everything. Can I try them out?
00:46:07.250,00:46:08.416,Sorry!
00:46:29.166,00:46:30.416,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey!"
00:46:33.041,00:46:35.791,-Somebody call security! -Security!
00:46:38.541,00:46:40.083,So what did they do?
00:46:40.166,00:46:42.708,They fired my ass. What do you think they did?
00:46:45.875,00:46:48.583,Gainful employment was cramping her style.
00:46:50.083,00:46:52.000,You could lose your fucking license.
00:46:52.916,00:46:53.916,What are you doing?
00:46:59.708,00:47:01.375,You gotta think about these kids.
00:47:01.458,00:47:05.041,"What do you think I've been thinking about since I was 18 years old, huh?"
00:47:05.125,00:47:08.166,Never had a life where I wasn't thinking about the kids.
00:47:09.375,00:47:10.708,It's all about us.
00:47:16.208,00:47:17.625,"Great plan, Mom."
00:47:21.500,00:47:25.083,"It isn't easy, all right? Just wait till you get pregnant."
00:47:25.166,00:47:26.583,I'm not having a kid.
00:47:26.666,00:47:30.000,You think you're special? That's what happens to girls.
00:47:30.083,00:47:31.708,Only girls that are stupid.
00:47:47.500,00:47:51.041,Can I put on Meet the Press? There's a special about Monica Lewinsky.
00:47:54.125,00:47:56.166,-What's the name of this game? -Son of a bitch!
00:48:00.958,00:48:05.041,"Well, if you don't like it, find some lame-ass loser to play with."
00:48:07.166,00:48:08.333,Deal.
00:48:21.041,00:48:24.291,You are the worst fucking card player I ever met.
00:48:28.666,00:48:31.000,"Hasta la vista, baby."
00:48:31.083,00:48:33.416,"Hasta la vista, baby."
00:48:38.000,00:48:41.916,"-How many times you've seen this movie? -Oh, about a hundred."
00:48:42.000,00:48:43.416,Why do you keep watching it?
00:48:44.000,00:48:46.458,"Like it, I figure."
00:48:46.541,00:48:53.750,"Everyone in this world is one of three kinds: a good Terminator, a bad Terminator, and neutral."
00:48:53.833,00:48:55.375,You're a good Terminator.
00:48:55.458,00:48:58.583,"Well, wasn't always. I had to learn."
00:49:00.375,00:49:03.291,"You could be, too, if you don't fuck it up."
00:49:04.208,00:49:05.208,You're like me.
00:49:07.291,00:49:08.291,Is Mom like you?
00:49:08.875,00:49:11.166,She and Papaw were more the same.
00:49:11.250,00:49:13.208,He was a good Terminator.
00:49:18.083,00:49:21.000,Why do you think he was living down the street there?
00:49:21.083,00:49:22.541,How was he bad?
00:49:24.291,00:49:28.291,"He let things get to him, make him feel small."
00:49:29.791,00:49:30.958,Could I be bad?
00:49:41.250,00:49:42.166,J.D.
00:49:57.750,00:50:01.041,-Mom? -What about me? Huh? Anybody?
00:50:15.208,00:50:17.125,-Mom? -Hey!
00:50:17.208,00:50:20.125,You're just upset! We all miss him!
00:50:20.208,00:50:24.291,Stop acting like he was your dad! He was my dad!
00:50:24.375,00:50:26.666,-You little bitch! -Hey! Stop!
00:50:33.583,00:50:35.291,-Bev… -He's my dad!
00:50:43.875,00:50:45.958,Hey! Hey!
00:50:48.125,00:50:49.916,Stand back!
00:51:08.625,00:51:12.541,Don't look at that! Come on! Don't you look at… -You look at me! -Okay.
00:51:12.625,00:51:14.250,You look at me! All right?
00:51:14.333,00:51:16.458,"Lindsay, honey! Come back down to my house!"
00:51:34.791,00:51:37.458,"Yes, I'm looking for a bed for my mother."
00:51:39.875,00:51:46.083,"No, she doesn't have insurance. But, um… No? Okay. Thanks."
00:51:47.375,00:51:48.333,Shit.
00:51:58.375,00:52:01.125,"Oh, my God. Is that a fried baloney sandwich?"
00:52:06.541,00:52:09.583,-Give me the damn sandwich. -I saved you the last slice.
00:52:09.666,00:52:12.125,I figured they don't have that at Yale.
00:52:13.208,00:52:16.625,I think this might be outlawed at Yale. My God.
00:52:17.833,00:52:19.125,I miss this.
00:52:21.000,00:52:23.541,"There they are. Oh, look at you, huh?"
00:52:23.625,00:52:26.125,Keep it down! He's talking to Yale! Ooh!
00:52:26.208,00:52:28.291,I ain't seen you since your Mamaw's funeral.
00:52:32.208,00:52:33.583,"-You got the beer. -Yes, I do."
00:52:35.541,00:52:40.791,"Uh… I… Well, enjoy your bunless dogs then."
00:52:44.833,00:52:46.416,"So what are you doing here, man?"
00:52:46.500,00:52:48.791,"Taking care of my mother, dealing with all that."
00:52:53.458,00:52:56.041,"-Whatever you do, don't go to Cedar Creek. -Trade ya."
00:53:02.375,00:53:05.166,Get her into Fairlawn. It's like a resort.
00:53:05.250,00:53:08.458,"They don't have beds. Plus, we can't afford that shit."
00:53:08.541,00:53:10.333,"-Hey, honey! -Yeah?"
00:53:10.416,00:53:14.375,Doesn't your friend Sally work over at that rehab… New Beginnings.
00:53:18.333,00:53:20.125,Can you believe someone married this guy?
00:53:20.208,00:53:22.541,Hell no. You kidding me? You blindfold her?
00:53:22.625,00:53:25.583,"Yeah, I blindfolded her. That's what I did."
00:53:31.541,00:53:32.375,Anything?
00:53:33.500,00:53:36.041,I'm still on hold. It's unbelievable.
00:53:44.791,00:53:46.375,Have you even talked to her?
00:53:47.208,00:53:49.500,"I just don't want to drag her into it, you know?"
00:54:03.791,00:54:04.625,Damn.
00:54:06.125,00:54:12.666,But Parker has taken it a step further …which isn't necessarily true.
00:54:12.750,00:54:14.375,-Be right back. -Usha's right.
00:54:16.458,00:54:20.250,"-Did you make it home all right? -Yeah, sorry I didn't call sooner."
00:54:20.333,00:54:22.458,I've just been dealing with all this stuff.
00:54:22.541,00:54:24.583,"Um, is your mom okay?"
00:54:24.666,00:54:29.791,"It's hard to tell, honestly, but the hospital's kicking her out at 3:00 p.m."
00:54:29.875,00:54:43.583,"and, uh, we're having a bitch of a time finding her a rehab so… I got a call from Glaston Hamburg."
00:54:43.666,00:54:46.083,You did? For a final interview?
00:54:46.166,00:54:48.166,"-Yeah, uh, with Phillip Roseman… -Yes!"
00:54:48.250,00:54:50.958,"-…tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. -That's incredible, J.D."
00:54:51.041,00:54:52.791,"Yeah, if I can make it."
00:54:53.291,00:54:54.666,Listen. Let me come.
00:54:54.750,00:54:57.208,I can stay with your mom and you come back and interview.
00:54:57.291,00:54:58.500,"Usha, I appreciate it."
00:54:58.583,00:55:01.166,But you'd have no idea what you'd be walking into.
00:55:01.250,00:55:04.250,"I've been in hospitals before, when my grandmother was sick."
00:55:04.333,00:55:06.583,"It's not the fucking flu, Usha!"
00:55:07.541,00:55:10.708,Okay? My mom overdosed on heroin.
00:55:12.416,00:55:14.625,-What? -Is that the kind of problem you want?
00:55:18.208,00:55:19.333,I didn't think so.
00:55:26.500,00:55:30.500,"Look, I gotta get back and deal with all this stuff. Bye."
00:55:48.791,00:55:53.750,"The guy said, Objectivity doesn't exist and legal interpretation is subjective."
00:55:53.833,00:55:57.833,Exactly. What does that mean? We can't trust the judicial system?
00:56:13.083,00:56:16.541,Cheryl thinks they might have space. Let's go.
00:56:16.625,00:56:17.916,Talk to Sally Coates.
00:56:18.000,00:56:20.958,"She said there was a spot that was spoken for, but go on down."
00:56:21.041,00:56:23.541,"-Thank you, Cheryl. -Yeah. You're welcome."
00:56:23.625,00:56:25.166,"Mom, where are my cleats?"
00:56:25.250,00:56:28.875,"Check under your bed, honey. Get me outta here."
00:56:31.125,00:56:34.166,-So you're a soccer mom. -Such a fake.
00:56:34.250,00:56:37.541,I don't know. I think I got you out-faked by a mile.
00:56:40.166,00:56:43.791,You really think rehab… What?
00:56:43.875,00:56:45.583,Think it'll do any good this time?
00:56:55.375,00:56:56.416,You miss me?
00:56:57.666,00:56:58.500,Yeah.
00:57:04.583,00:57:05.875,You know how it is.
00:57:13.291,00:57:17.708,"I, uh… -I brought you this. -What's this?"
00:57:18.791,00:57:23.000,Some stuff for you to do while you're in here so you don't get bored.
00:57:23.666,00:57:28.208,"It's got funny jokes and math problems and some Bible stuff, too."
00:57:28.791,00:57:29.916,I made it.
00:57:43.083,00:57:44.166,I love you.
00:57:46.583,00:57:49.791,"When I get out of here, I'm going to make a real home for us."
00:57:50.708,00:57:51.541,Okay?
00:57:52.083,00:57:55.708,"You gotta help me do more cooking and all that healthy stuff, okay?"
00:57:59.083,00:58:00.791,It's gonna be different now.
00:58:11.375,00:58:14.666,We're here to visit my son Victor. Victor Boyd.
00:58:14.750,00:58:17.041,"Oh, of course. Please have a seat."
00:58:18.791,00:58:19.708,"Hi, sir. Yes?"
00:58:19.791,00:58:23.041,Hello. I'm J.D. Vance. I'm here to see Sally Coates.
00:58:28.375,00:58:33.916,"I'd love to help, but there's a procedure to getting on the wait list-- Ma'am, I understand."
00:58:34.000,00:58:38.791,"Okay, but my mom's had a really tough time since Mamaw died a few years back."
00:58:39.375,00:58:43.833,I wish I could help. It's just-- I respect your need to follow procedure.
00:58:44.500,00:58:46.000,I know she messed up.
00:58:46.625,00:58:51.791,"And she's had a history of it, but she also has a history of being a pretty good person."
00:58:56.000,00:59:01.833,"She put herself through nursing school as a single mother, and now I'm at law school."
00:59:02.708,00:59:15.166,"I just… I really… Ma'am, I really think that… if my mom had somebody to believe in her… You need to understand that I can't leave here."
00:59:15.750,00:59:18.916,I can't until I've done everything humanly possible.
00:59:20.833,00:59:22.333,All right? This is my family.
00:59:23.791,00:59:27.958,"So until you drag me out of here, I'm gonna keep giving you reasons."
00:59:33.500,00:59:36.166,"Jason Flip, to the group room please. Thank you."
00:59:40.583,00:59:43.166,-Glad I was able to help. -Thank you so much.
00:59:44.333,00:59:45.541,"Good, Linds."
00:59:48.500,00:59:50.541,"Okay, uh, bear with me here."
00:59:52.041,00:59:56.583,Five hundred on this one and a thousand on this one.
00:59:56.666,01:00:00.208,Sorry. Five hundred on this one and a thousand on this one.
01:00:00.291,01:00:01.208,This one?
01:00:10.125,01:00:11.208,Pick me up here.
01:00:11.291,01:00:14.208,I need payment for the first two weeks to check her in.
01:00:15.000,01:00:24.541,"Okay. Um… Okay, put 500 more on this one and, uh… 1,000 on that one."
01:00:24.625,01:00:28.333,And that should be… good. Let me know if those all go through.
01:00:29.416,01:00:30.625,Sorry about this.
01:00:37.166,01:00:38.250,"Okay, you're good."
01:00:40.458,01:00:42.041,"Okay, perfect. Thank you."
01:00:42.125,01:00:43.208,That's done.
01:00:43.291,01:00:45.250,Amazing. I'll come back and sign those.
01:00:45.333,01:00:47.791,"-I'll let my mom know what's going on. -Yes, sir."
01:00:49.541,01:00:51.833,"Okay, uh, you're good to go."
01:00:51.916,01:00:55.083,Once the doctor and the therapist do their assessment of you.
01:00:58.041,01:00:59.000,I changed my mind.
01:00:59.083,01:01:00.708,-Where are you going? -What?
01:01:00.791,01:01:04.125,-I begged them to let you stay here. -Nobody asked you to.
01:01:05.041,01:01:07.375,"-I'm not a charity case. -Why am I here, Mom?"
01:01:11.458,01:01:13.875,"-You even care what you do to Lindsay? -J.D., shut up."
01:01:13.958,01:01:16.708,-Leave her out of this! -You did the same thing to Mamaw.
01:01:16.791,01:01:20.291,You just took and took from her until she was practically bankrupt.
01:01:20.375,01:01:23.791,"-Yeah, she was a goddamn saint. -All she ever did was bail you out!"
01:01:23.875,01:01:25.541,Except when it mattered!
01:01:27.000,01:01:30.000,Do you actually want to be dead? Or you just too lazy to try?
01:01:41.666,01:01:44.666,We can't leave her here. She's got no place to go.
01:01:44.750,01:01:46.583,-You keep defending her. -I'm not!
01:01:46.666,01:01:49.791,She was worse to you than anybody. Now she's making you feel guilty.
01:01:49.875,01:01:51.333,Just like she did with Mamaw.
01:01:54.375,01:01:56.208,"You don't know everything, J.D."
01:01:56.291,01:01:59.208,"She's been doing this since we were kids, Lindsay. Come on."
01:02:00.125,01:02:02.833,"Well, it didn't start with her."
01:02:04.791,01:02:08.750,"Mom and Aunt Lori, they had it worse than us."
01:02:09.541,01:02:11.250,It was a war in that house.
01:02:17.208,01:02:21.125,"You come home drunk one more time, I'm gonna light your ass on fire!"
01:02:28.958,01:02:30.708,Stop it! Get out!
01:02:32.166,01:02:35.875,You goddamn son of a bitch. You're lying there in your own piss!
01:02:36.583,01:02:38.750,I told you what I was gonna do!
01:02:45.625,01:02:47.291,You're no goddamn father!
01:03:14.541,01:03:19.500,I can't defend her… but I'm trying to forgive her.
01:03:22.625,01:03:26.791,"If you don't, you're never gonna get out of what you're trying to get out of."
01:04:10.875,01:04:16.208,"Mom, this is… This is my girlfriend. This is Usha."
01:04:21.958,01:04:23.166,What is she?
01:04:25.000,01:04:26.125,She's Indian.
01:04:28.833,01:04:30.375,"Well, she's really pretty."
01:04:30.875,01:04:32.625,I think you'd like her a lot.
01:04:32.708,01:04:34.333,You should bring her here.
01:04:39.833,01:04:41.750,I've been doing real good.
01:04:42.583,01:04:53.666,"I've been working, trying to get my license back. I… I just had a down… you know, month."
01:05:05.000,01:05:06.958,"I got an interview tomorrow, Mom."
01:05:07.041,01:05:08.458,"-Otherwise, I'd-- -Yeah."
01:05:12.666,01:05:14.416,You sure you don't wanna stay here?
01:05:14.500,01:05:16.000,"-I got you the bed. -Oh, no."
01:05:17.083,01:05:18.708,Just take me to Ray's.
01:05:18.791,01:05:21.375,"-Mom, come on. -Oh, you know me."
01:05:22.083,01:05:23.750,I always land on my feet.
01:05:29.041,01:05:32.416,"Congratulate me, why don't you? I'm a married woman."
01:05:32.500,01:05:34.000,You're getting married?
01:05:37.666,01:05:38.666,Well?
01:05:39.625,01:05:41.375,Aren't you happy for me? Hello?
01:05:42.041,01:05:44.041,Why didn't you tell anybody?
01:05:44.125,01:05:47.291,-I thought you two were gonna break up. -I didn't marry Matt.
01:05:47.375,01:05:48.500,I married Ken.
01:05:48.583,01:05:49.666,What?
01:05:49.750,01:05:51.083,Who the hell's Ken?
01:05:51.166,01:05:53.916,My boss at the dialysis center.
01:05:54.458,01:05:57.500,Ugh. Kiss my ruby-red asshole. When'd all this happen?
01:05:58.875,01:06:01.750,"Anyway, it's been over with Matt for a while."
01:06:01.833,01:06:03.291,It's over with Matt?
01:06:03.375,01:06:06.250,"Well, obviously. I married somebody else."
01:06:22.541,01:06:25.875,This is a kitchen with kitchen stuff.
01:06:27.541,01:06:32.583,And… this was a kegerator when we moved in.
01:06:35.458,01:06:37.416,We keep sodas there now.
01:06:41.458,01:06:43.541,"Hey, I'm sorry about your dog."
01:06:44.208,01:06:47.000,"You know, I can't breathe. It's the dander."
01:06:48.291,01:06:50.291,"Hey, let me show you your room."
01:06:50.875,01:06:51.916,Over here.
01:06:56.833,01:06:57.958,This is Travis.
01:06:58.041,01:07:00.041,"Uh, Travis, this is J.D."
01:07:19.500,01:07:22.750,My dad smokes all the time. He doesn't know I take it.
01:07:24.208,01:07:26.500,He keeps it in here.
01:07:29.375,01:07:30.291,Wanna get high?
01:07:37.000,01:07:38.458,What? You never smoked?
01:07:40.875,01:07:42.916,-My mom's in recovery-- -Chickenshit!
01:07:44.250,01:07:46.416,"What do they do where you come from, hmm?"
01:07:47.166,01:07:48.958,-Whippits? -No.
01:07:53.041,01:08:01.083,"-You gotta loosen up a bit, man. -I, uh… -Maybe next time. -Pussy!"
01:08:13.125,01:08:17.083,"I'm Joie Chen. Coming up, reaction to our interview with Iran's new president."
01:08:20.000,01:08:21.625,I need you to piss in this.
01:08:22.208,01:08:26.083,I got a call from the nursing board. I have to give them a sample today.
01:08:26.166,01:08:27.583,-A sample? -Clean piss.
01:08:27.666,01:08:31.500,"Mamaw's got 100 prescriptions in hers, so-- Why isn't yours clean?"
01:08:33.166,01:08:34.666,Just do it. Okay?
01:08:34.750,01:08:37.541,-Why isn't yours clean? -Come on now. Go do it!
01:08:37.625,01:08:39.583,-No! -Please!
01:08:51.791,01:09:02.750,"I've been trying really hard with Ken, but it just… It isn't easy, and… I promise that I'm gonna do better, but I can't lose my job."
01:09:02.833,01:09:06.333,-You should've thought of that before. -I know. I really need this.
01:09:06.416,01:09:10.583,"No! If you want clean piss, stop fucking up your life and get it from your own bladder!"
01:09:10.666,01:09:12.416,What is going on down here?
01:09:12.500,01:09:14.916,She wants my piss because hers is dirty.
01:09:15.000,01:09:16.708,It's for the nursing board!
01:09:39.333,01:09:41.791,"J.D., you need to help your mama on this."
01:09:44.916,01:09:48.666,You let her get away with this every time. How is she gonna learn?
01:09:48.750,01:09:50.291,I told you I would do better.
01:09:50.375,01:09:52.875,-You always say that! You're lying! -I always try!
01:09:52.958,01:09:57.791,"J.D.-- If you'd put your foot down years ago, she wouldn't be like this! She wouldn't!"
01:09:57.875,01:10:00.875,You're a shitty mom and so are you!
01:10:25.750,01:10:29.000,But things haven't exactly worked out for your mama.
01:10:31.916,01:10:34.041,We can't let them take her license.
01:10:34.125,01:10:36.916,Why? It's her own stupid fault.
01:10:38.166,01:10:41.833,"I know this ain't right, honey, but she's your mother."
01:10:42.416,01:10:48.791,"And maybe if we help her this one last time, she'll finally learn her lesson and keep her job."
01:10:48.875,01:10:51.083,Why can't we let her clean her own mess up?
01:10:51.166,01:10:55.166,'Cause family is the only thing that means a goddamn.
01:10:57.583,01:10:58.791,You'll learn that.
01:11:04.166,01:11:05.750,"Mamaw, I wanna stay with you."
01:11:08.166,01:11:09.333,Can I stay?
01:11:11.208,01:11:13.916,Can't do that. We're not gonna do that to her.
01:11:15.666,01:11:17.416,But you always got me.
01:11:19.500,01:11:23.250,Now… do this for her.
01:12:01.958,01:12:02.916,Mamaw!
01:12:06.208,01:12:07.083,Mamaw!
01:12:12.916,01:12:14.166,Mamaw!
01:12:27.166,01:12:28.083,Shit!
01:12:37.375,01:12:39.375,-Mamaw? -Hmm.
01:12:45.458,01:12:46.541,Are you gonna die?
01:12:48.875,01:12:52.500,-What the hell are you asking me that for? -They said you have pneumonia.
01:12:53.416,01:12:55.208,People can die from pneumonia.
01:12:55.291,01:12:58.291,-Are you trying to kill me off? -I know you know.
01:12:59.166,01:13:00.083,People know.
01:13:00.166,01:13:04.208,What kind of feather-brained idea is that? Who knows they're gonna die?
01:13:04.291,01:13:07.916,People do. Like… Native Americans.
01:13:08.416,01:13:14.916,"They're called Indians. Like the Cleveland Indians, and they don't know more than other people."
01:13:15.916,01:13:18.958,They're not magic just 'cause they don't have microwaves.
01:13:19.041,01:13:20.333,Just tell me!
01:13:20.916,01:13:23.375,-I don't know. -Are you gonna die now?
01:13:23.458,01:13:24.916,You mean right now?
01:13:28.500,01:13:32.416,"I just told you, I don't goddamn know."
01:13:33.000,01:13:35.583,Fine. Just go ahead and die.
01:13:35.666,01:13:37.458,"Oh, J.D."
01:13:39.000,01:13:43.250,"You might think that algebra is jail, but it's not."
01:13:43.833,01:13:47.083,It's freedom. Boil it down.
01:13:47.166,01:13:50.166,"Balance. If it's good on the left, it's good on the right."
01:13:53.875,01:13:57.583,"All right, next week, quadratic equations. Bum-bum-bum."
01:13:58.166,01:14:03.791,"We'll be putting those graphing calculators to use, so, if you don't have one, go get one."
01:14:04.625,01:14:05.708,J.D.
01:14:10.666,01:14:13.250,You're gonna need a parent's signature on that.
01:14:16.958,01:14:19.083,You're gonna fail if you keep this up.
01:14:20.333,01:14:22.000,I think you're smarter than that.
01:14:52.583,01:14:54.333,"All right, one foot. One foot."
01:15:11.041,01:15:12.500,"Aren't you gonna work, man?"
01:15:19.708,01:15:23.250,They fired Cheyenne. Said she missed too many days or some shit.
01:15:24.708,01:15:29.208,"It was all 'cause she was puking, mostly, but that was just the first three months."
01:15:31.083,01:15:32.500,"She's pregnant, idiot."
01:15:35.333,01:15:38.458,Always bitching at me to take shorter bathroom breaks.
01:15:39.083,01:15:41.250,"Anyway, the guy fucked me out of a week's pay."
01:15:41.333,01:15:44.250,Fuckin' Trent. Not even a real name.
01:15:48.291,01:15:50.250,I was thinkin' about going over there.
01:15:50.916,01:15:51.791,Fuck shit up.
01:15:51.875,01:15:53.666,How are we gonna get out there?
01:15:54.291,01:15:55.333,Shit.
01:15:59.750,01:16:01.958,My mamaw's car is here.
01:16:04.333,01:16:07.083,-All right! -Hell yeah.
01:16:13.041,01:16:14.000,Fuckin' Trent.
01:16:19.916,01:16:20.750,"Come on, J.D."
01:16:21.458,01:16:22.666,Come on. Let's go.
01:16:23.250,01:16:25.166,"-Come on, man! -What are you waitin' for?"
01:16:29.625,01:16:31.083,"Who's Trent now, motherfucker?"
01:16:33.208,01:16:36.583,"-Pee-Wee needs a bat. Let's go. -Let's go, Pee-Wee!"
01:17:00.666,01:17:04.083,"Well, where else would he be? He hasn't worked since 2007."
01:17:04.166,01:17:07.791,He inherited the top floor of this dump. Thinks he's a land baron.
01:17:24.125,01:17:25.500,"-What the fuck, Ray? -The hell?"
01:17:25.583,01:17:28.416,-Stay out of my house! -You're a piece of shit!
01:17:30.333,01:17:34.125,"-Get down and talk to me, motherfucker! -It's none of your goddamn business, boy!"
01:17:35.041,01:17:38.000,You're a hillbilly loser. You ain't even got any of your teeth.
01:17:39.708,01:17:42.250,"Don't call my mom a whore, you son of a bitch!"
01:17:42.333,01:17:46.000,She is a whore! She'll suck anybody's dick that's got one!
01:18:00.333,01:18:01.250,Open up!
01:18:08.833,01:18:12.041,Get outta here! I got kids here! Get the fuck outta here!
01:18:39.375,01:18:40.750,He's an asshole.
01:18:41.916,01:18:44.083,Why'd he have to wreck my things?
01:18:59.666,01:19:03.291,You and your sister are the only things I ever did in my life worth shit.
01:19:03.958,01:19:05.916,I don't know how you got so far.
01:19:06.625,01:19:08.833,I don't know how far I've really gotten.
01:19:54.416,01:19:57.125,"They all coulda, or he coulda gone to jail."
01:19:58.750,01:20:01.958,He needed me and I just kept leaving him there.
01:20:02.041,01:20:04.708,What he needed was his damn mother.
01:20:05.250,01:20:07.458,I just kept running off with Kevin.
01:20:08.291,01:20:10.791,Didn't even ask him if he wanted to come.
01:20:11.791,01:20:15.458,"Aw, honey, you got a right to your own life."
01:20:16.041,01:20:18.208,J.D. ain't your responsibility.
01:20:22.250,01:20:23.416,Whose is he?
01:20:38.750,01:20:40.708,What in God's name happened back there?
01:20:40.791,01:20:42.875,That lard-ass called the cops on me.
01:20:42.958,01:20:46.500,Why did J.D. think you was going to kill him? What'd you do to him?
01:20:46.583,01:20:51.666,Nothing. He said some shit. I got mad-- -Did you hit him? -It's not serious.
01:20:51.750,01:20:53.708,Should I have let him get hit by a car?
01:20:53.791,01:20:56.916,-If he wasn't being a little shit-- -You've always got a reason!
01:20:57.000,01:20:58.666,It's always someone else's fault.
01:20:58.750,01:21:04.000,"Some point, you're gonna have to take responsibility -or someone else is gonna have to… -Or what?"
01:21:04.083,01:21:06.666,"-…step in! -Who, huh? Who?"
01:21:07.541,01:21:08.833,You?
01:21:09.500,01:21:11.208,What are you gonna do?
01:22:17.708,01:22:20.000,Hello? What are you doing?
01:22:22.166,01:22:23.166,Mom?
01:22:26.541,01:22:27.750,I don't know.
01:22:32.583,01:22:33.791,Get your stuff.
01:22:36.250,01:22:39.375,"I don't give a rat fart what you're smoking, kid."
01:22:39.958,01:22:43.166,"If you think you're hiding it, honey, you're dumb as a bag of hair."
01:22:43.250,01:22:44.750,-Pack up. -For what?
01:22:44.833,01:22:45.958,What are you doing?
01:22:50.833,01:22:54.791,"If you got a problem with that, you can talk to the barrel of my gun."
01:22:59.208,01:23:01.250,-He's a teenager. -It's not just that.
01:23:01.333,01:23:04.666,He needs somebody to pay some fucking attention before it's too late.
01:23:04.750,01:23:10.875,"What do you think I've been doing, huh? I got us into this new house, -good new school-- -He coulda gone to jail, Beverly."
01:23:11.625,01:23:16.000,He's got loser friends and he's gonna be a loser if somebody don't do something.
01:23:16.083,01:23:19.291,"No, he's not, and you can't take him because he's not yours."
01:23:19.375,01:23:20.541,He might as well be.
01:23:20.625,01:23:21.500,I want to go.
01:23:26.541,01:23:27.750,You want to go?
01:23:28.750,01:23:29.958,And live with her?
01:23:34.250,01:23:37.916,"She's crazy, you know that. She's been crazy my whole life."
01:23:38.000,01:23:40.750,"If you wanna live with that crazy old witch, go right ahead."
01:23:40.833,01:23:42.541,You two were made for each other.
01:23:50.875,01:23:52.208,Go on. Get your stuff.
01:24:03.958,01:24:07.125,"Hey, Lindsay. Sorry to bother you at work. I've been calling you."
01:24:07.208,01:24:08.583,I couldn't get ahold of you.
01:24:09.208,01:24:12.250,Mom's not staying at Ray's. 'Cause she can't.
01:24:13.375,01:24:16.791,Big surprise. Guy's a piece of shit.
01:24:16.875,01:24:18.250,Tell me about it.
01:24:18.333,01:24:20.958,-Where is she at? -She's out by the car.
01:24:22.625,01:24:31.375,"I'm trying to think of, uh… I don't know. I was wondering if… She can't stay with us."
01:24:32.083,01:24:35.000,"Not in the shape she's in, not with the kids."
01:24:35.666,01:24:36.708,Yeah.
01:24:36.791,01:24:38.000,When you got to go?
01:24:49.125,01:24:52.250,Take her to that motel out on Verity. She's stayed there before.
01:24:52.333,01:24:54.541,I'll try to get off work early and check on her.
01:24:55.083,01:24:56.500,"I don't know, Lindsay."
01:24:57.083,01:24:58.208,What?
01:24:58.291,01:25:00.916,I could drive ten hours and not even get the job.
01:25:02.166,01:25:03.416,Or you could.
01:25:03.500,01:25:05.541,But it just doesn't feel right.
01:25:05.958,01:25:08.708,I wouldn't feel good leaving you to deal with this shit.
01:25:10.291,01:25:12.666,"Don't make us your excuse, J.D."
01:25:14.416,01:25:15.833,It's just the way it is.
01:25:17.166,01:25:18.166,I'm all right.
01:25:21.666,01:25:22.708,Yeah.
01:25:24.166,01:25:25.250,Register.
01:25:27.708,01:25:29.583,-I love you. -Love you.
01:25:31.875,01:25:32.916,I'm going.
01:25:38.083,01:25:40.375,"-Nah, look at this. Three in a row. -Yeah."
01:25:41.458,01:25:42.291,Yo.
01:25:43.458,01:25:47.333,I don't suppose one of you deadbeats want to help me with my groceries.
01:25:51.666,01:25:56.666,"Well, I guess you two are too busy eating my food."
01:25:57.958,01:25:59.250,Which one are you?
01:26:00.041,01:26:03.000,I'm Louis… Zablocki.
01:26:04.833,01:26:06.375,That's a Polish name.
01:26:07.208,01:26:09.291,You know what's interesting about the Poles?
01:26:09.375,01:26:12.791,They bury their dead with their asses sticking out of the ground.
01:26:12.875,01:26:15.458,That way they got a place to park their bikes.
01:26:17.750,01:26:18.875,What about you?
01:26:19.458,01:26:21.375,I'm… Frank?
01:26:21.458,01:26:22.791,Is that a question?
01:26:23.375,01:26:24.791,"You got a job, Frank?"
01:26:25.958,01:26:29.750,"Had a paper route, but… got laid off."
01:26:29.833,01:26:32.458,Which one of you can spell Mississippi?
01:26:36.250,01:26:37.083,Out!
01:26:37.708,01:26:40.875,And don't you come back or I'll run you over with my car.
01:26:40.958,01:26:43.625,-You know I'll by God do it. -What are you doing?
01:26:43.708,01:26:45.750,You can stay or go with them.
01:26:53.416,01:26:54.541,Those are my friends.
01:26:54.625,01:26:57.041,Not anymore. You can thank me later.
01:26:57.625,01:27:01.625,"Three years from now, those idiots will be on food stamps or in jail."
01:27:02.166,01:27:05.333,-Who am I supposed to talk to? -Talk to yourself. Works for me.
01:27:07.750,01:27:08.875,Your homework done?
01:27:08.958,01:27:10.875,-No. -Why the hell not?
01:27:10.958,01:27:13.875,-I don't have the right calculator. -Go get the damn thing!
01:27:14.458,01:27:15.666,Costs $84.
01:27:21.250,01:27:22.958,"What, is it made out of gold?"
01:27:25.416,01:27:27.833,Do your damn dishes! This ain't a hotel.
01:27:30.708,01:27:32.875,Not like that. You'll break it all!
01:27:32.958,01:27:34.541,All you do is yell at me!
01:27:34.625,01:27:37.625,"If you didn't act like a shit-for-brains, I wouldn't have to."
01:28:01.750,01:28:03.625,"Hey, can I help you?"
01:28:04.958,01:28:08.291,"Um… No, thank you."
01:28:08.375,01:28:10.666,"Okay. If you need anything, just let me know."
01:28:31.916,01:28:33.458,Hey. Hey!
01:28:34.708,01:28:36.791,Hey! Take it out!
01:28:37.958,01:28:39.833,Take it out now! Give it to me.
01:28:42.166,01:28:44.083,The hell do you think you're doing?
01:28:47.958,01:28:50.500,"You do that again, I'll leave you there."
01:29:02.250,01:29:03.250,You're welcome.
01:29:04.875,01:29:09.166,"Now stop stealing things, do your fucking homework and find some decent friends."
01:29:09.250,01:29:12.083,-I don't want new friends. -Then you're not gonna have any.
01:29:12.166,01:29:14.375,You can't tell me that. You're not my mom.
01:29:14.458,01:29:15.541,I'm all you got.
01:29:22.291,01:29:26.083,Now get out before I cancel your birth certificate.
01:29:28.500,01:29:34.583,Get out and get that calculator or don't bother getting back in.
01:29:52.041,01:29:54.750,You're damn lucky that thing ain't busted.
01:29:55.250,01:30:00.458,"If I weren't crippled, I'd get out of this car, walk around and smack your head and your ass together!"
01:30:00.541,01:30:03.291,-Why do you even want me? -Who said I wanted you?
01:30:04.458,01:30:06.250,"I really hate you, you know that?"
01:30:06.333,01:30:09.791,I don't care you hate me. I ain't in it for popularity.
01:30:11.791,01:30:17.000,"You gotta take care of business, go to school, get good grades to even have a chance."
01:30:17.083,01:30:19.708,Mom was the best in her class. What's the point?
01:30:19.791,01:30:22.291,The point is you don't know shit.
01:30:23.416,01:30:25.666,I'm talking about a chance.
01:30:25.750,01:30:28.458,"You might not make it, but you sure won't if you don't try."
01:30:28.541,01:30:30.291,Why do you even care what I do?
01:30:30.875,01:30:32.958,I ain't gonna live forever.
01:30:34.958,01:30:37.750,Who's gonna take care of this family when I'm gone?
01:30:42.458,01:30:45.291,I thought your mama was gonna be all right.
01:30:46.083,01:30:48.500,"Be happy, do good."
01:30:49.333,01:30:51.375,But she got tore up around here.
01:30:51.458,01:30:53.208,She just up and quit.
01:30:53.291,01:30:55.291,She just stopped trying.
01:30:58.083,01:31:05.750,I know… I coulda done better.
01:31:09.958,01:31:17.208,"But you, you got to decide, you want to be somebody or not?"
01:32:25.291,01:32:27.708,It's just till we figure everything out.
01:32:37.500,01:32:39.708,Here. Let me.
01:32:44.291,01:32:46.541,"All right, Mom. I gotta get on the road."
01:32:46.625,01:32:49.166,"But I'll run across, get us something to eat."
01:32:49.250,01:32:50.166,You want anything?
01:32:50.833,01:32:56.916,"Yeah, get me some, um… Funyuns and some Grandmother's cookies, not oatmeal."
01:32:57.791,01:32:59.458,-And some juice. -Okay.
01:33:01.000,01:33:04.875,"Thanks for, um… Thanks."
01:33:05.833,01:33:06.666,Yeah.
01:33:45.833,01:33:48.333,Or are you gonna get up off your ass and help me?
01:33:57.666,01:34:00.125,-Got Meals on Wheels for Bonnie Vance. -Thank you.
01:34:01.916,01:34:03.666,"Well, this isn't enough."
01:34:03.750,01:34:05.958,I told 'em I got my grandson now.
01:34:12.916,01:34:17.416,"Look, uh… I'm spread a little thin right now."
01:34:17.500,01:34:19.708,I couldn't buy my pills this month.
01:34:21.083,01:34:27.791,Can you maybe… Let me see here.
01:34:28.708,01:34:30.083,"Well, I got some fruit."
01:34:30.625,01:34:33.166,That's the best I can do. Will that help?
01:34:39.625,01:34:41.875,"Um, how about this?"
01:34:45.125,01:34:48.166,-I really do appreciate that. -Mm-hmm.
01:36:41.875,01:36:42.833,Thanks.
01:36:57.916,01:37:02.208,I want to see these cans get on the shelf without coming down on my foot.
01:37:03.125,01:37:04.875,-I got those. -Oh.
01:37:06.541,01:37:10.875,"Great, after that you can help-- Guess who got the highest grade on the algebra test."
01:37:21.958,01:37:26.250,It's the best grade in the class. Best grade in the class.
01:37:27.208,01:37:28.166,That so?
01:37:40.833,01:37:41.791,Keep that up.
01:38:15.416,01:38:16.750,"Mom, I got your food."
01:38:18.500,01:38:19.583,Mom.
01:38:24.333,01:38:25.291,Mom!
01:38:31.333,01:38:32.416,Mom!
01:38:38.333,01:38:39.833,-Give me the-- -No!
01:38:39.916,01:38:41.625,No! No!
01:38:43.750,01:38:46.000,-No! -Mom! Stop it!
01:38:46.083,01:38:48.875,-Just… Mom! Stop it! -What are you doing?
01:38:56.666,01:38:57.750,"Christ, Mom!"
01:39:00.750,01:39:03.041,"What's wrong with you, Mom? Come on!"
01:39:17.250,01:39:18.625,"-Mom, I-- -Don't you touch me!"
01:39:18.708,01:39:21.000,You get away from me! Bastard!
01:39:40.791,01:39:41.791,Christ.
01:39:45.583,01:39:48.250,"-Let's get you to bed. -I'm so sorry, baby."
01:39:48.333,01:39:49.916,"-I know, Mom. -I'm so sorry."
01:39:50.000,01:39:52.166,"I know, Mom. It's okay."
01:41:40.541,01:41:41.916,but then face-to-face.
01:41:42.000,01:41:47.125,"Now I know in part, then shall I know even as also I am known."
01:42:03.000,01:42:03.875,Get the surp.
01:42:04.375,01:42:06.583,-Get the what? -The surp.
01:42:07.625,01:42:09.333,Can't have pancakes without surp.
01:42:09.416,01:42:12.500,"Oh, my God, J.D. It's not surp, it's syrup."
01:42:12.583,01:42:13.708,-Surp. -Syrup.
01:42:15.083,01:42:17.166,-If you think that-- -You're so cute!
01:42:17.250,01:42:21.375,If you think this is so… -We're not gonna be able to eat. Usha. -Say it again.
01:42:21.458,01:42:22.291,-Syrup. -Surp.
01:42:22.375,01:42:24.375,"If I say it, will you get the damn surp?"
01:42:24.458,01:42:25.458,-Say it again. -Surp.
01:42:25.541,01:42:48.041,"-Surp. -Now please… I love you, Mom."
01:42:54.041,01:42:55.416,I want you to get better.
01:42:56.000,01:42:57.958,-I know. -For you to be happy.
01:43:01.125,01:43:02.250,And I'll help you.
01:43:02.750,01:43:04.375,I'll do everything I can.
01:43:09.250,01:43:10.500,But I can't stay.
01:43:15.750,01:43:17.583,I'm not saving anyone here.
01:43:22.750,01:43:24.083,Lindsay's on her way.
01:43:27.083,01:43:29.166,I really hope you'll wait for her.
01:43:33.583,01:43:34.875,But I have to go.
01:44:17.583,01:44:18.875,"Don't give up, Mom."
01:45:16.208,01:45:17.125,Hey.
01:45:19.291,01:45:20.333,Where are you?
01:45:20.916,01:45:21.750,I'm driving.
01:45:22.375,01:45:23.250,Back?
01:45:24.250,01:45:25.083,Yeah.
01:45:30.208,01:45:35.416,"Yeah. uh… Look, Usha, I'm… I'm sorry."
01:45:36.416,01:45:46.583,I'm sorry I didn't just come out and tell you all this stuff before. Uh… Guess I was just worried that I'd scare you off.
01:45:51.041,01:45:52.000,Did I?
01:45:54.791,01:45:55.875,Not even close.
01:45:58.833,01:45:59.916,Where are you now?
01:46:01.000,01:46:03.250,"Uh, comin' up on Columbus."
01:46:03.333,01:46:07.000,"Columbus? Unless you drive like hell, you're not gonna make it."
01:46:07.083,01:46:11.375,"I survived Tactical Driving in the Marines, okay? I can handle I-70."
01:46:11.458,01:46:13.750,Okay. I'm keeping you company.
01:46:13.833,01:46:17.041,"No, babe. Just go back to sleep. Please, it's late."
01:46:17.125,01:46:18.916,Nope. We're doin' this.
01:46:21.750,01:46:28.125,"Let's see, uh… So, um… Read any good books lately?"
01:46:28.208,01:46:32.416,"Yeah. Yeah, Cases and Materials on Statutory Interpretation."
01:46:32.500,01:46:34.125,"Oh, sounds hot."
01:46:39.208,01:46:44.166,"In boot camp, the only way you're allowed to talk to your family is with letters."
01:46:44.250,01:46:47.541,"And my family, they-- yeah, they wrote me every day."
01:46:48.583,01:46:51.500,Mamaw's letters were just the greatest.
01:46:52.125,01:46:56.166,"She would go from, Jesus walks with you, J.D. Stay strong."
01:46:59.375,01:47:03.958,I wish I had a gun so I could shoot that dickhead drill sergeant of yours.
01:47:14.583,01:47:18.000,and started over with what they could fit in Papaw's truck.
01:47:18.083,01:47:19.750,Yeah.
01:47:19.833,01:47:22.083,That's… that's like my dad.
01:47:22.958,01:47:24.500,He came here with nothing.
01:47:25.500,01:47:27.208,He had to just find his way.
01:47:34.458,01:47:37.375,I think that's what kills me the most about Mamaw.
01:47:39.791,01:47:45.416,"I never got to tell people, uh… just how much she meant to me."
01:47:48.708,01:48:04.250,"She'd been sick a long time, but when it happened, I couldn't… Wish I could have met her."
01:48:06.416,01:48:07.500,"Yeah, me, too."
01:48:19.458,01:48:20.500,Where are you now?
01:48:20.583,01:48:23.916,I had to get off I-95 because the traffic was so bad.
01:48:24.000,01:48:27.250,I'm on some side street. I'll be there in about an hour.
01:48:28.208,01:48:29.291,An hour?
01:48:30.125,01:48:32.250,-You're not gonna make it. -I know.
01:48:32.333,01:48:33.791,"I don't know what to do, Usha."
01:48:33.875,01:48:36.791,"Can you go down there and tell him I'm on my way, please?"
01:48:38.458,01:48:40.750,"Yeah, yes, I can do that."
01:48:41.375,01:48:43.291,"Okay, I'll call you right back."
01:48:43.375,01:48:45.291,Okay? It's gonna be fine. Drive safe.
01:49:07.041,01:49:09.875,The first time it was Mamaw who saved me.
01:49:12.333,01:49:13.166,Yeah.
01:49:15.750,01:49:20.875,"That where we come from is who we are, but we choose every day who we become."
01:49:21.791,01:49:27.625,"My family's not perfect, but they made me who I am and gave me chances that they never had."
01:49:28.250,01:49:32.083,"My future, whatever it is, is our shared legacy."
01:49:33.083,01:49:34.375,Good to see you again.
