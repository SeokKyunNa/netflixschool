00:01:13.333,00:01:14.583,If it was an accident.
00:01:15.750,00:01:23.375,"Hannaford, before he changed his mind, was gonna give the car to the young leading actor of his last movie, John Dale."
00:01:24.166,00:01:29.458,"And Hannaford was supposed to have saved him, at some earlier date, from committing suicide."
00:01:30.583,00:01:32.125,Or so the story goes.
00:01:32.875,00:01:39.333,"As for his own death, his admirers were sure that Hannaford did not intend to drive the car off that bridge."
00:01:39.916,00:01:41.750,"A corny ending, they said."
00:01:42.166,00:01:44.750,J.J. Hannaford would never be guilty of that.
00:01:45.666,00:01:47.375,But there were other opinions.
00:01:53.041,00:01:54.083,...July 2nd.
00:01:55.291,00:02:01.333,"For years, I personally didn't want this document shown because, frankly, I didn't like the way I came off in the piece."
00:02:02.125,00:02:05.125,But I'm old enough now not to care anymore...
00:02:05.666,00:02:08.416,how my role in Jake's life is interpreted.
00:02:09.666,00:02:14.791,"My name is Brooks Otterlake, probably Hannaford's most successful acolyte."
00:02:15.916,00:02:20.125,"Anyway, this little historical document has been put together from many sources."
00:02:20.833,00:02:34.875,"From all the footage shot by TV and documentary filmmakers, and also the students, critics, and young directors who happened to bring 16 and eight-millimeter cameras, having been invited to Jake's... 70th birthday party."
00:02:36.208,00:02:40.125,That was long before cell phone cameras and computerized images.
00:02:41.250,00:02:46.291,The choice of this material is an attempt to sketch a film likeness of the man himself as he looked...
00:02:47.250,00:02:49.958,through all those different viewfinders.
00:02:51.166,00:02:58.166,"Hannaford's own unfinished last motion picture is part of this testimony, The Other Side of the Wind."
00:02:59.500,00:03:05.875,"It has been left just as it was when they showed it at his party, on what turned out to be..."
00:03:06.250,00:03:07.541,the last day of his life.
00:04:54.666,00:04:57.916,"Cut. Thank you, everybody. That's a wrap."
00:05:10.458,00:05:12.708,Zarah Valeska is the one giving the party.
00:05:12.791,00:05:15.666,"According to Jake, she's the greatest cook in the world."
00:05:15.750,00:05:20.375,Is she the one who talked Jake into letting all the media get at him at once?
00:05:21.250,00:05:22.958,We're the Close-up on Hannaford people.
00:05:26.625,00:05:27.500,I'm independent.
00:05:27.750,00:05:29.625,"Pister, from The Film Institute."
00:05:29.708,00:05:34.166,Everybody else not assigned transportation can collect in the carpool.
00:05:36.208,00:05:38.500,"Mostly, the nudies are driving their own cars."
00:05:38.750,00:05:40.458,I want to make sure they can get home.
00:05:40.541,00:05:43.625,-And the beards? -A TV special for the BBC.
00:05:44.875,00:05:47.833,"I'm doing a film, and he's doing a book on Mr. Hannaford."
00:05:48.208,00:05:50.333,"And I know somebody, somewhere, who isn't."
00:05:50.625,00:05:53.333,Uh-huh. But mine is the authorized biography.
00:05:53.750,00:05:55.833,"It's certainly one of them, Ms. Rich."
00:05:56.416,00:05:58.833,"May I present, Maggie Warden, our film editor."
00:05:58.916,00:06:01.833,"Ms. Juliette Rich, the celebrated critic."
00:06:06.541,00:06:09.416,"Come on, Matt, I ain't trying to be funny. Ask the boss."
00:06:12.750,00:06:14.750,"Hey, Costello, step over here, will you?"
00:06:14.833,00:06:16.000,Who let you in?
00:06:17.625,00:06:20.333,"He'll want you with him, Mr. Otterlake. He always does."
00:06:26.000,00:06:28.000,Hey! You wanna ride out with the boss?
00:06:28.083,00:06:30.416,You can just catch him at the studio gate.
00:06:30.500,00:06:31.833,Mr. Pister.
00:06:31.958,00:06:33.333,The first name is Marvin.
00:06:34.625,00:06:37.750,"This is Matt Costello, he's Mr. Hannaford's personal assistant."
00:06:38.333,00:06:40.041,"Yeah, I do all the dirty jobs."
00:06:42.625,00:06:44.583,"-You'll just have to wait. -Hi, Billy."
00:06:44.875,00:06:47.791,"Sorry. Sorry, Brooksie, I was talking to him."
00:06:48.666,00:06:50.916,"I-- I guess you'll be riding with Jake, won't you?"
00:06:56.750,00:06:58.708,"marked students, is for the students!"
00:07:10.708,00:07:14.166,and the midgets... in the blue charter bus.
00:07:15.750,00:07:16.583,"Here, sir."
00:07:19.000,00:07:20.916,Billy's screening the film with him.
00:07:21.250,00:07:33.166,"I know it should have been you, Baron, but according to Jake, -Isn't he always? -Huh. We'll see about that."
00:07:33.708,00:07:35.958,I had hoped to ride with the naked ladies.
00:07:42.375,00:07:43.708,or whatever you are...
00:07:44.041,00:07:46.875,in the bus with the green stripes!
00:07:47.458,00:07:50.500,"Uh, according to Jake, I'm more Max's style."
00:07:52.208,00:07:53.291,Maybe he's right.
00:08:01.416,00:08:03.916,"Hi, Max, remember me? Billy Boyle."
00:08:04.000,00:08:05.916,"I've seen you in some Hannaford films, haven't I?"
00:08:08.500,00:08:11.750,He let me play a few friends of the heroes for a while.
00:08:12.583,00:08:14.416,-We're both reformed... -Where is he?
00:08:14.500,00:08:15.666,"...actors, aren't we?"
00:08:16.916,00:08:21.833,"Uh, Jake? Oh, I-- I don't think we ought to wait for him."
00:08:21.916,00:08:23.416,He's still on the set?
00:08:23.625,00:08:26.833,"Well, I don't actually know just where he is at the moment."
00:08:29.375,00:08:32.625,"the jazz musicians, and the midgets..."
00:08:32.958,00:08:35.125,on the blue charter bus!
00:08:42.333,00:08:43.333,Everybody got it.
00:08:46.166,00:08:47.666,I'm fired?
00:08:50.333,00:08:51.416,That's the message?
00:08:54.375,00:08:55.208,Why?
00:08:55.291,00:08:59.500,Why? Would somebody please tell me why I'm going to his party?
00:08:59.583,00:09:00.625,You're invited.
00:09:00.708,00:09:02.791,All these stupid dummies.
00:09:02.916,00:09:03.875,They're invited.
00:09:13.250,00:09:15.625,It comes right after what we were shooting today.
00:09:15.708,00:09:19.583,"She leaves the steam room, and here's this character waiting for her."
00:10:20.791,00:10:23.125,"Through the window, right there. Come on, man."
00:10:23.250,00:10:26.166,"Life was never like this in Hicksville, huh, Julie?"
00:10:30.250,00:10:32.750,"I remember, Polack extraction."
00:10:32.958,00:10:34.458,"Richeviski, huh?"
00:10:35.000,00:10:37.875,"You certainly seem to know quite a lot about me, Mr. Costello."
00:10:38.291,00:10:39.375,Call me Matt.
00:10:43.291,00:10:47.458,"He's on that committee, the one that decides if you're an American."
00:10:47.875,00:10:51.000,Maybe you didn't know that these people are still in business.
00:10:51.083,00:10:53.291,You mean that Mr. Hannaford's investigating me?
00:10:53.708,00:10:55.333,"We're still in business, huh?"
00:10:58.041,00:11:00.708,"So what am I gonna see, everything he's shot up until now?"
00:11:00.791,00:11:02.625,"Well, the first couple of reels, Max."
00:11:02.708,00:11:05.166,The last part's already at the ranch.
00:11:05.625,00:11:07.458,Zarah's giving him this party.
00:11:07.541,00:11:09.916,She's invited all these movie freaks.
00:11:10.250,00:11:12.916,We'll see the rest of the stuff when we get out there.
00:11:13.708,00:11:15.375,"Zarah's expecting you, Max."
00:11:18.250,00:11:19.500,So is Jake.
00:11:20.375,00:11:21.833,I was expecting him here.
00:11:26.041,00:11:28.750,"Fine. Rolling. Hello, hello, hello... Okay, I'm ready to go."
00:11:28.833,00:11:30.750,"Just go right ahead and talk, Mr. Hannaford."
00:11:33.041,00:11:35.833,"Mr. Hannaford, is the camera eye a reflection of reality?"
00:11:35.916,00:11:38.791,Or is reality a reflection of the camera eye?
00:11:39.250,00:11:41.166,Or is the camera merely a phallus?
00:11:41.625,00:11:44.166,-I want a drink. -You heard him. Let's get it out here!
00:11:45.708,00:11:47.083,"-Here. -Don't you agree, Otterlake?"
00:11:49.041,00:11:50.375,not just us.
00:11:55.291,00:11:56.875,"Otherwise, I'm gonna fall off the car."
00:12:02.833,00:12:04.958,He-- He's the kid on the motorcycle.
00:12:15.583,00:12:17.833,"According to Jake, the box likes him."
00:12:18.541,00:12:20.833,-Box? -The old magic box.
00:12:22.000,00:12:25.375,"If the camera doesn't like an actor, it just stares at him."
00:12:28.750,00:12:30.166,"Well, that's what Jake says."
00:12:30.250,00:12:32.875,And if the actor doesn't like the old magic director?
00:12:40.750,00:12:41.791,Well...
00:12:47.625,00:12:49.625,"And if he doesn't come back, how will you finish it?"
00:12:55.875,00:12:57.541,You know how he is sometimes.
00:12:58.166,00:13:02.291,"He's... turning sour, Matt. He's going bad."
00:13:06.875,00:13:12.083,"All my life, I've been sticking my nose into other people's wrinkles."
00:13:13.375,00:13:15.708,I know the little signs.
00:13:16.500,00:13:19.916,It's something you can almost... smell.
00:13:23.083,00:13:23.916,Gypsies?
00:13:24.000,00:13:26.041,"Nine months, we practically lived with them."
00:13:26.333,00:13:27.708,"Jake's first picture, in Spain."
00:13:41.708,00:13:44.666,"Hey, hey. Can you look over here? That's it..."
00:13:47.625,00:13:48.625,In the story.
00:13:48.833,00:13:50.833,"You-- You'll meet her at the party, Max."
00:13:55.625,00:13:57.208,How does the box feel about her?
00:14:03.958,00:14:09.958,"To assess, Mr. Hannaford, just how fully that theme in your work may be a reflection of your father's suicide-- The suicide can wait."
00:14:10.041,00:14:11.875,We ought to start with a broader spectrum.
00:14:11.958,00:14:13.291,"Don't you agree, Otterlake?"
00:14:16.375,00:14:18.833,as a propman... for the ol' cliffhangers.
00:14:18.916,00:14:20.000,You were a property man?
00:14:20.083,00:14:23.875,"Bombs, you know? Buzz saws, pits-- pits full of deadly serpents..."
00:14:23.958,00:14:30.833,He provided all the-- I'm in the middle-- I'm telling your life story.
00:14:31.041,00:14:32.416,This was in Hollywood?
00:14:32.500,00:14:33.750,Of course it was Hollywood.
00:14:33.833,00:14:34.875,"He, uh..."
00:14:35.833,00:14:39.583,"He shared a-- a bungalow with his first leading man, you know?"
00:14:39.958,00:14:42.916,"I even know his name. Frank Fryer. How about that, Skipper?"
00:14:43.250,00:14:45.125,And I'm the only one not doing a book about you.
00:14:46.333,00:14:48.958,My book on Hannaford has been canceled.
00:14:51.583,00:14:57.125,The first five chapters took the two of us three and a half years to-- to do.
00:14:57.250,00:15:00.041,I finally-- I had to start directing myself so I could eat.
00:15:01.833,00:15:03.333,"And now, I suppose you're too busy."
00:15:03.958,00:15:07.083,"No. Well, we both are. Take it from me, fellas..."
00:15:07.458,00:15:10.250,"our friend here, he just purely hates being interviewed."
00:15:11.041,00:15:13.916,"So, I-- I donated a lot of my old tapes, you know?"
00:15:14.000,00:15:18.041,"Scattered them here and there, among you cineastes, you know?"
00:15:19.458,00:15:21.666,To spare him as many questions as possible.
00:15:22.583,00:15:23.583,Answers.
00:15:24.250,00:15:25.625,Answers are my department.
00:15:26.250,00:15:27.750,"John Dale, for instance."
00:15:38.500,00:15:39.791,That's the scene.
00:15:40.625,00:15:41.583,Which scene?
00:15:41.791,00:15:42.916,"Well, the scene."
00:15:50.791,00:15:52.458,Is that what this movie's about?
00:15:52.833,00:15:56.250,Kids today-- Kids today? What the hell do you know about it?
00:15:57.416,00:15:59.416,What does Jake know at his age?
00:15:59.500,00:16:00.541,He better know.
00:16:05.708,00:16:08.666,Jake wanted him. A baby.
00:16:11.750,00:16:13.666,Or haven't you noticed?
00:16:16.875,00:16:18.500,-Silents. -Silents?
00:16:18.583,00:16:22.708,Shh! Um... Action pictures. Plenty of action.
00:16:23.083,00:16:28.916,"Jake and Frank used to strip to the waist, every Saturday night, and they'd put their pay envelopes..."
00:16:29.166,00:16:32.625,"on the, uh... on the mantelpiece, and they'd fight each other for the pot."
00:16:32.708,00:16:34.958,-What ever happened to him? -Fryer?
00:16:36.083,00:16:37.041,"I don't know, kid."
00:16:38.791,00:16:41.750,"-They come and they go. -John Dale, for instance?"
00:16:42.375,00:16:44.916,"Yes, the latest of all those actors you've discovered."
00:16:45.291,00:16:47.666,Discovered? Like we went pearling for 'em?
00:16:48.291,00:16:50.875,Squeezed your movie star out of an oyster?
00:17:09.916,00:17:12.708,"Well, no editing, really. It's just the slates cut off."
00:17:13.250,00:17:14.291,Gumdrop?
00:17:14.875,00:17:18.333,"All right, men, let's get organized. Now, where should we start?"
00:17:18.916,00:17:23.750,"Where ol' Dad here ran away to sea or, uh, way back with the ancestors?"
00:17:24.291,00:17:27.333,"All right, save your voice, Skipper. It's all here on the tapes."
00:17:32.125,00:17:35.541,"Barrett, McCullough, Hannaford, O'Neil... What else was there to be?"
00:17:36.000,00:17:39.375,"You carried bricks, or got into politics, or went on the stage."
00:17:39.833,00:17:42.958,Ol' Junius Hannaford was pretty big in high tragedy.
00:17:43.375,00:17:48.666,"And Junius Junior, as befits the second generation, made it into high society."
00:17:49.166,00:17:52.666,"A pioneer snob, blazing the trail for the Kellys and the Kennedys."
00:17:56.625,00:17:57.958,he was a prop boy.
00:17:58.416,00:17:59.958,David Leigh was an extra.
00:18:00.541,00:18:06.333,"Neil Trevor, Branch Sutter, Just listen."
00:18:09.250,00:18:12.833,"Fished him out of the sea. Yeah, that's what you'd call a discovery."
00:18:12.916,00:18:14.000,Do you get it?
00:18:14.416,00:18:16.750,He saved the cat's life.
00:18:20.666,00:18:23.708,Can you imagine a relationship more all-consuming...
00:18:24.375,00:18:26.166,between master and slave?
00:18:29.875,00:18:30.791,We did what we could.
00:18:30.875,00:18:35.208,"Kept him on the yacht, signed him on as a deckhand, and made a sailor out of him, or tried to."
00:18:35.375,00:18:36.791,"Sure, I rescued him."
00:18:37.041,00:18:38.958,And I've been rescuing him ever since.
00:18:39.208,00:18:42.708,"Look what he did with the others. Glen Garvey, Courtney Saxon..."
00:18:42.791,00:18:46.250,Courtney? He was selling vacuum cleaners when Jake discovered him.
00:18:46.916,00:18:50.125,And as for Hannaford hisself-- What about him?
00:18:50.250,00:18:55.000,"-Branch Sutter, he was a dishwasher. -It could be he's wrong this time."
00:18:55.083,00:18:55.916,Who says so?
00:18:56.000,00:18:57.375,Zimmer says so. Ha!
00:18:57.916,00:19:00.416,I don't know what I think of this one.
00:19:03.750,00:19:05.000,See that cop back there?
00:19:07.416,00:19:09.666,Uh... you guys are overloaded.
00:19:09.875,00:19:10.916,"Thanks, Jack."
00:19:17.041,00:19:20.583,"-Can he ride with you, Jack? -Uh, I haven't got the insurance."
00:19:22.458,00:19:23.541,See you at the party.
00:19:24.000,00:19:25.000,"Thanks, Jack."
00:19:41.166,00:19:42.708,"I'm not really sure, Max."
00:19:44.416,00:19:47.000,"Uh, maybe-- maybe it's here she leaves the-- the..."
00:19:47.791,00:19:48.916,the bomb.
00:20:05.208,00:20:06.583,"Having fun, Mr. Pister?"
00:20:06.916,00:20:09.416,The people in that last car were kind of... awful.
00:20:09.500,00:20:10.875,Mr. Hannaford's car?
00:20:10.958,00:20:11.875,They threw me out.
00:20:11.958,00:20:16.333,And then I-- I tried-- I got a ride with a bunch of video freaks.
00:20:16.500,00:20:19.291,"But they ran out of gas, or needed a fix or something."
00:20:23.458,00:20:27.708,"Well, be-- before this, she'll be pretending to look in the window at 'em."
00:20:27.958,00:20:30.166,"That is, when we get around to shooting it."
00:20:40.541,00:20:43.708,"and then, the boy thinks she's been looking at these dolls."
00:20:48.500,00:20:49.916,"Well, the one she..."
00:20:50.375,00:20:52.000,he thinks she was looking at.
00:20:53.166,00:20:54.083,So...
00:20:54.333,00:20:57.041,"well, he goes in and buys it for her."
00:20:57.875,00:20:59.166,"May I see that, please?"
00:21:01.041,00:21:05.125,"-Jake wrote that? -It's transcribed from tapes, I guess, but it hasn't been typed."
00:21:05.541,00:21:07.375,The hippies and the beatnicks.
00:21:07.458,00:21:10.166,The bums. Call them what you want to.
00:21:10.833,00:21:15.708,They slouch and slack around the floor because they like it down there.
00:21:16.291,00:21:21.208,"Talk about the return to the womb, what about the return to the cave?"
00:21:23.041,00:21:25.833,Junk. Junk is how you get there.
00:21:26.166,00:21:28.166,That's how you dig your way back!
00:21:30.333,00:21:36.458,"for the cool dreams, kid. And the cool, dim, anonymous gang shag."
00:21:36.916,00:21:38.583,The mutual jack-off.
00:21:50.541,00:21:51.666,What's in the package?
00:21:51.791,00:21:54.458,"Uh, the package. You-- You mean, what she's got in her bag?"
00:21:59.875,00:22:01.166,That-- That's the doll!
00:22:08.208,00:22:09.166,"Okay, Billy."
00:22:10.375,00:22:13.916,There is going to be film showing that there's a doll in this package?
00:22:14.000,00:22:15.875,"Oh, sure, that's easy, Max."
00:22:15.958,00:22:17.250,Just-- Just an insert.
00:22:22.416,00:22:23.416,And the bomb?
00:22:42.416,00:22:43.625,What do we know?
00:22:45.750,00:22:47.375,You-- You better ask Jake.
00:22:47.583,00:22:49.208,I better read the script.
00:22:54.916,00:22:56.708,Oh. There isn't one.
00:23:00.541,00:23:02.708,Jake is just making it up as he goes along.
00:23:04.958,00:23:06.333,He's done it before.
00:23:10.708,00:23:11.958,"Man, they're real."
00:23:12.041,00:23:14.125,He made them real. He gave them existence.
00:23:14.708,00:23:16.333,He molded them out of clay.
00:23:18.500,00:23:19.750,He conceived them.
00:23:20.375,00:23:21.375,Like a God.
00:23:23.250,00:23:24.916,A terrible and jealous God.
00:23:25.000,00:23:27.333,That's what he's been with this new boy of his.
00:23:27.625,00:23:30.583,John Dale is Hannaford's personal creation.
00:23:31.583,00:23:33.000,"There's something else, too."
00:23:33.333,00:23:34.750,An even stronger claim.
00:23:35.625,00:23:38.250,Very much in the Hannaford style.
00:23:52.625,00:23:54.583,And Jake's gonna have to shoot it.
00:23:55.125,00:23:59.458,"Oh, like I told you, Max, an awful lot of the footage is out at the ranch."
00:23:59.791,00:24:02.291,We'll be screening it for you... at the party.
00:24:29.333,00:24:31.791,"Just a little more basil. Otherwise, it's good."
00:24:44.750,00:24:45.833,No. Nobody.
00:24:50.291,00:24:52.416,"It's open season tonight, Mr. Otterlake."
00:24:52.750,00:24:54.250,We are in public domain.
00:25:01.083,00:25:03.708,"Major studio is a bullshit word, but that's the word."
00:25:03.916,00:25:05.958,I made a picture that made money. That's what I had to do.
00:25:06.041,00:25:09.083,That's right. What about those people who can't first make a picture that makes money?
00:25:09.375,00:25:12.041,They're not interested in making a picture that makes money. That's my point!
00:25:12.125,00:25:15.958,"He's a man who could take a mediocre idea, and do something absolutely atrocious with it."
00:25:18.916,00:25:22.125,"Inevitably, the need to make money creates the need for a certain kind of picture."
00:25:22.291,00:25:23.333,And the picture...
00:25:29.125,00:25:30.958,is so incredibly facile.
00:25:31.041,00:25:35.416,"If you indulged in aestheticism for its own sake, it could be called an abstract."
00:25:36.958,00:25:38.375,what's the point of going to the movie?
00:25:39.875,00:25:42.291,I'd like to get John Wayne's audience in to see my movie.
00:25:48.458,00:25:50.166,"-Not in the way you think it is. -Well, okay."
00:25:50.291,00:25:53.000,"There's still rich people, poor people starving, and a middle class."
00:25:53.083,00:25:58.166,"Why wouldn't they listen to me? What assholes they were, and what a dying dinosaur they were involved in."
00:26:01.625,00:26:03.458,You don't see the point at all.
00:26:03.541,00:26:04.541,I hate the system.
00:26:04.625,00:26:08.708,I think that it's relatively easy to make a good... movie.
00:26:09.625,00:26:10.708,Not a great one.
00:26:11.125,00:26:12.416,That's... something else.
00:26:12.500,00:26:15.208,-Hannaford's new movie? -You do know about that.
00:26:15.291,00:26:17.708,"Yes, indeedy, ma'am. We'll be seeing it here tonight."
00:26:17.791,00:26:19.541,Not this character. You won't be seeing him.
00:26:19.625,00:26:21.708,Not until they find an actor for it.
00:26:21.791,00:26:28.208,"Mostly, we're just supposed to feel him spying on the boy and on the girl, too, of course... from the shadows."
00:26:28.291,00:26:30.083,Am I quoting you correctly? Of course I am.
00:26:32.958,00:26:34.666,And a perfectly splendid imagination.
00:26:34.750,00:26:36.375,Don't try and be cute. Answer the question.
00:26:36.458,00:26:37.875,"Would you just repeat it, please?"
00:26:37.958,00:26:39.291,I didn't think you asked anything.
00:26:41.750,00:26:44.166,I just want to know what he represents.
00:26:47.041,00:26:49.250,"well, he's-- he's sort of a hermit living out there."
00:26:49.625,00:26:51.625,There is a possibility.
00:26:51.791,00:26:54.458,A Peeping Tom. You tell us.
00:26:54.916,00:26:56.416,"This part, we didn't cast."
00:26:56.916,00:26:58.291,This old man.
00:26:58.958,00:26:59.916,He's Hannaford.
00:27:02.333,00:27:03.416,Hannaford himself.
00:27:16.791,00:27:18.916,Mr. Hannaford! Mr. Hannaford! It's me!
00:27:19.000,00:27:20.541,"Happy birthday, Jake! Happy birthday!"
00:27:21.375,00:27:23.458,-Mr. Hannaford? Mr. Hannaford? -Happy birthday.
00:27:24.000,00:27:26.208,I'm Marvin P. Fassbender.
00:27:26.750,00:27:27.791,Of course you are.
00:27:59.791,00:28:03.333,"This is Mr. Hannaford's night. Let's save the questions for him, huh?"
00:28:03.416,00:28:05.166,"You two are very close, aren't you?"
00:28:05.250,00:28:07.083,"Yes, I'd like to ask you about that."
00:28:09.375,00:28:11.458,Why do you think you have to be as rude as he is?
00:28:11.541,00:28:13.416,"As rude as you are. In print, anyway..."
00:28:13.500,00:28:15.041,"-I liked your last picture. -Yeah, sure."
00:28:15.250,00:28:17.750,"No, I know that it was-- it was repetitive..."
00:28:20.041,00:28:23.375,"And... Oh, shit. For what it was, it worked."
00:28:23.458,00:28:25.916,"Yeah, well, she wasn't that kind to me in her review."
00:28:26.000,00:28:30.416,Not that you did much harm. How much harm can you do to the third biggest grosser in movie history?
00:28:30.500,00:28:32.666,Did it really make that much? How marvelous.
00:28:32.791,00:28:39.250,"Yes. Did you know that when his own production company goes public, that your friend there stands to walk away with $40 million."
00:28:42.000,00:28:43.875,"that I stole everything from you, Skipper."
00:28:43.958,00:28:47.416,-I'm never going to walk away from that. -It's all right to borrow from each other.
00:28:47.541,00:28:49.458,What we must never do is borrow from ourselves.
00:28:53.750,00:28:55.708,"Of course you are close, you two."
00:28:56.500,00:28:57.625,You have to be.
00:28:58.791,00:29:00.083,You have no choice.
00:29:02.708,00:29:04.041,"Please, dear lady..."
00:29:04.875,00:29:07.083,don't tell us what you mean by that.
00:29:16.166,00:29:17.916,"That's what she wanted, don't you think?"
00:29:18.000,00:29:19.125,"Okay, if she says so."
00:29:21.416,00:29:27.000,"Gypsies, jazz, and mariachis, all for a bunch of creeps who only want to listen to themselves talking."
00:29:27.083,00:29:28.416,"Jesus Christ, I tell you!"
00:29:34.416,00:29:38.458,your name has been linked romantically with quite a few celebrities.
00:29:39.625,00:29:43.625,Wasn't it understood that we weren't going to talk about love affairs?
00:29:44.958,00:29:47.708,What you agreed to talk about is Mr. Hannaford.
00:29:50.125,00:29:53.208,"-How about Jack Simon, right here? -You tell us, Brooksie."
00:29:53.333,00:29:55.166,"Jack's got it in his contract. Right, Jack?"
00:29:55.250,00:29:58.458,"Every picture he directs, he gets to shoot the animals personally..."
00:29:58.541,00:29:59.458,with a gun!
00:29:59.958,00:30:02.916,"-They even pay him off in guns. -No, they pay me money, kid."
00:30:03.000,00:30:05.541,Oh. And they say I imitate him.
00:30:07.416,00:30:10.541,"Well, that's your thing, Otterlake, you're good at imitations."
00:30:14.541,00:30:16.541,A fascist? Shall we define our terms?
00:30:16.625,00:30:21.416,"Spades, spics, micks, hunkies, honkies, hebes, those kind of terms?"
00:30:21.916,00:30:24.666,Fasci-tists? We don't like them kinda people.
00:30:24.833,00:30:27.000,-What kind of people does he like? -Nobody.
00:30:27.291,00:30:28.291,Nobody at all.
00:30:28.833,00:30:30.208,Nobody in the plural.
00:30:30.416,00:30:32.166,"And then, who in the particular?"
00:30:33.208,00:30:36.458,"Mr. Otterlake, for instance. Ms. Valeska."
00:30:42.791,00:30:44.333,"Jokingly, of course."
00:30:44.666,00:30:45.791,Is that right?
00:30:45.875,00:30:48.166,GF meaning God the Father.
00:30:52.083,00:30:53.125,...Mr. Hannaford.
00:30:56.541,00:30:57.791,"Right, Mr. Hannaford?"
00:31:00.250,00:31:01.333,Thus spaketh Jake.
00:31:01.833,00:31:02.750,What's that about?
00:31:12.916,00:31:15.291,The first one to give up. But I still know all the material.
00:31:15.375,00:31:16.375,"You know, religion..."
00:31:16.958,00:31:19.125,"Here it is, the Gospel According to Jake."
00:31:19.833,00:31:22.625,God the Father is an old Jew...
00:31:23.125,00:31:25.166,invented by a lot of other old Jews...
00:31:25.250,00:31:27.708,in a hopeless attempt to put down the Jewish mother.
00:31:29.958,00:31:33.041,"That's what the whole new scene's about, you know? Everything..."
00:31:33.500,00:31:35.833,"-even his movie. -Um, what's that about the movie?"
00:31:35.916,00:31:38.291,-You mean the one-- -We don't talk about the movie.
00:31:38.375,00:31:39.583,Try the Baron here.
00:31:40.000,00:31:42.041,"Under torture, he might squeal a little."
00:31:42.333,00:31:45.458,-He writes the scripts. -So Mr. Hannaford likes to say.
00:31:45.666,00:31:53.583,"Please, don't pretend to be stupid. Now, you're supposed to be the brainy one in this club or this, I don't know, this clan, whatever-- It's a highly informal organization, lady."
00:31:53.708,00:31:55.208,The tape that we were hearing.
00:31:55.291,00:31:57.041,The subject is God. Is he a member?
00:31:57.125,00:31:57.958,She.
00:32:00.750,00:32:03.083,"We're all ruled by the wind, aren't we, lady?"
00:32:03.875,00:32:08.833,"So, uh, if the Lord is a lady, and God's will is Her will, then we can all relax and..."
00:32:09.333,00:32:11.416,stop expecting the universe to be logical.
00:32:13.708,00:32:15.500,We're right back where we started.
00:32:16.416,00:32:17.458,Back to Mama.
00:32:19.833,00:32:22.583,When he's using straight Hannaford dialogue.
00:32:23.416,00:32:25.250,"Gee, that's real nice, Jack, coming from you."
00:32:30.041,00:32:32.041,-is... um... -Yes?
00:32:36.750,00:32:39.208,how his disciple feels about the new Hannaford film.
00:32:41.583,00:32:45.041,"Hey, why pick on me? The man is infested with disciples."
00:32:45.125,00:32:46.541,"I'm the apostle, lady."
00:32:47.000,00:32:49.916,"Sure, just like Saint Paul. I know the lyrics to that one, too."
00:32:50.000,00:32:54.750,"Oh, we're sure you do, Brooksie. Uh-- Yeah. The Apostle Paul packaged it."
00:32:55.166,00:33:03.916,"You know, by now, Jesus was dead-- so the subject was in public domain, and, um... um..."
00:33:04.041,00:33:05.958,"Let's see, now. Where was I, folks?"
00:33:07.583,00:33:09.916,"So, when Paul dreamed up Christianity..."
00:33:10.875,00:33:11.708,and...
00:33:15.416,00:33:21.333,"...and stuck the -anity into Christ-- As long as I'm still twitching, Brooksie, you ain't gonna stick it into me."
00:33:24.125,00:33:27.458,Movies and friendship. Those are mysteries.
00:33:27.541,00:33:31.041,"And religion. The Baron's into that, and I know his material, too."
00:33:31.125,00:33:32.458,You ought to get away from both.
00:33:35.625,00:33:37.666,It never explains. Right?
00:33:38.000,00:33:40.500,"Yes. Just like you, Mr. Hannaford."
00:33:40.583,00:33:42.333,Just like me and God.
00:33:42.708,00:33:46.125,"If it weren't for the difference in sex, how could you tell us apart?"
00:33:51.375,00:33:55.083,He asked for them. It was Mr. Hannaford's idea.
00:33:55.958,00:33:56.791,How's this one?
00:33:57.458,00:33:58.583,"Fine, Joey."
00:34:00.458,00:34:02.250,"So, how do they look? Hmm?"
00:34:04.916,00:34:06.375,"Stupid, that's how they look."
00:34:10.791,00:34:13.916,you pulled out of the water and stuck into pictures.
00:34:14.416,00:34:17.708,"The orphan, Mr. Johnny Dale. Do you know where he came from?"
00:34:18.375,00:34:19.875,Where he really came from?
00:34:20.083,00:34:24.083,"A big rich family in Ohio. How do you like them apples, huh?"
00:34:27.541,00:34:31.541,"He graduated from boarding school, one of the snotty, expensive ones."
00:34:32.041,00:34:35.708,We found one of his teachers. He's coming right out here with Billy.
00:34:38.166,00:34:39.583,When is he joining the party?
00:34:40.458,00:34:41.333,He isn't.
00:34:42.416,00:34:43.250,No?
00:34:43.875,00:34:46.333,-Any word from Texas? -The oil money?
00:34:49.291,00:34:50.125,Not yet.
00:34:53.250,00:34:54.375,"Well, here it is..."
00:34:55.250,00:34:56.875,if anybody wants to see it.
00:35:00.291,00:35:05.875,"and if I understand, your whole idea was to get Jake Hannaford in touch with the new generation."
00:35:13.291,00:35:16.958,Most people of Mr. Hannaford's age are too old for him.
00:35:19.875,00:35:20.708,Hello.
00:35:22.000,00:35:24.666,"We don't have much of a past... do we, beautiful?"
00:35:25.000,00:35:27.333,We made just half of a picture together.
00:35:27.416,00:35:29.458,That was in Ms. Valeska's country.
00:35:35.958,00:35:37.250,She threw him out.
00:35:38.416,00:35:40.083,Her USO Troop led our...
00:35:40.333,00:35:43.625,armies into battle. I witnessed it from the rear.
00:35:43.750,00:35:45.708,But you did liberate the Ritz.
00:35:45.791,00:35:48.250,"No, her friend Hemingway put in for that one."
00:35:48.375,00:35:50.291,Jake was three bottles ahead of him.
00:35:50.375,00:35:51.750,Where did you come from?
00:35:52.333,00:35:53.541,The studio.
00:35:53.875,00:35:55.041,"Jake, I told you."
00:35:58.000,00:36:00.875,That left hook of his was overrated.
00:36:01.125,00:36:04.500,Every man contains within himself...
00:36:05.291,00:36:07.333,the whole condition of humanity.
00:36:07.416,00:36:08.875,"Write that down, somebody."
00:36:09.375,00:36:10.208,Somebody did.
00:36:10.666,00:36:12.125,She even gave me the book.
00:36:12.291,00:36:14.750,Mr. Hannaford enjoys pretending to be ignorant.
00:36:14.833,00:36:17.125,"Then she spoiled the present by, uh..."
00:36:17.500,00:36:19.041,telling me who gave it to her.
00:36:20.208,00:36:22.458,"Oh, just someone he doesn't happen to like."
00:36:22.541,00:36:24.250,The queers adore great women.
00:36:24.500,00:36:28.125,"They like all women, Uncle. They're the only sex that does."
00:36:28.208,00:36:29.041,True.
00:36:29.958,00:36:33.500,Real men never like us. Men only like men.
00:36:33.666,00:36:34.583,"And, um..."
00:36:35.125,00:36:37.041,Women keep us away from each other.
00:36:37.375,00:36:40.500,"Ah, but if I cut him off, we ask ourselves."
00:36:41.208,00:36:45.833,"Cut him off from all his good companions, what will be left of him?"
00:36:46.416,00:36:47.708,"An amputee, perhaps?"
00:36:48.041,00:36:49.583,An emotional basket case?
00:36:59.916,00:37:09.583,"As I open my mouth, we raise our glasses to a great gentleman, who is not only a great artist, but one who's been called the Ernest Hemingway of the cinema."
00:37:10.208,00:37:14.958,"The Murnau of the American motion picture. Who Murnau is, I don't remember."
00:37:15.625,00:37:17.875,"Let me see... Murnau and Dean, the vaudeville act."
00:37:17.958,00:37:23.083,"As I recall, they played in either Lowes Newark, or Pickleton on Thames in Great Britain."
00:37:23.166,00:37:24.833,"That's enough, Georgie."
00:37:28.250,00:37:29.250,What for?
00:37:29.583,00:37:31.666,The one thing you'd most like to have.
00:37:33.000,00:37:36.625,Or... one last thing you'd like to do.
00:37:37.958,00:37:39.541,Don't you think it can happen?
00:37:40.375,00:37:41.791,It'll take a lot of blowing.
00:37:43.166,00:37:45.125,That should be a job for Ms. Rich.
00:37:46.583,00:37:51.375,She'd huff and puff and blow the house down.
00:38:09.333,00:38:11.291,"Okay, let's get to the movie, shall we?"
00:49:35.458,00:49:36.291,Yes?
00:49:36.458,00:49:38.875,-Start the movie again. -I can't.
00:49:45.333,00:49:46.458,Both of them.
00:49:49.791,00:49:52.125,"Who knows. Johnny Dale, maybe."
00:49:53.916,00:49:55.916,into the generator with his monkey wrench.
00:50:00.291,00:50:03.333,"Never went in much for symbolism, did we, Baron?"
00:50:06.458,00:50:08.791,We've got a power failure on our hands.
00:50:09.208,00:50:11.916,The ranch's generators have broken down.
00:50:12.000,00:50:15.791,"But, we hope the situation will be temporary."
00:50:16.458,00:50:25.916,"Meanwhile, we'll be getting lamps for you from out in the stables and lighting up candles, so you can all find your ways to the booze and the eats."
00:50:26.666,00:50:35.083,"Projection of Mr. Hannaford's motion picture, The Other Side of the Wind, will, naturally, be suspended until the juice comes on."
00:50:35.166,00:50:40.291,We trust you good folks will find your own ways to amuse yourselves.
00:50:42.458,00:50:45.208,Our gallant musicians will keep right on till the end.
00:50:45.333,00:50:48.458,"They can't see the notes, but that's all right, they can't read them."
00:50:48.708,00:50:52.250,"Abe, how nice to see you looking so old."
00:50:56.833,00:50:58.500,"Whistling in the dark, old man?"
00:50:58.583,00:51:01.625,"Well, kid, you whistle or you whimper. How is it in your corner?"
00:51:03.458,00:51:05.291,Confrontation's the word for it.
00:51:05.500,00:51:09.541,"-Abe, take it up with the hostess. -Zarah? You must be nuts."
00:51:09.666,00:51:12.375,Mother seems to think a little young blood would be good for us.
00:51:16.208,00:51:19.416,"Excuse me, fellas, I think we have ourselves a confrontation."
00:51:19.666,00:51:23.458,I dig. It's not that he didn't make any female stars.
00:51:23.791,00:51:26.291,It's just that he didn't make them stars.
00:51:26.375,00:51:27.750,That's my whole thesis.
00:51:27.916,00:51:30.000,"Great thesis. So, the old man can still score."
00:51:30.083,00:51:31.083,Who says so?
00:51:31.541,00:51:34.458,"How he scores, and who he scores with."
00:51:35.208,00:51:37.916,"That, my friend, gets us into some very interesting country."
00:51:42.916,00:51:44.125,There wasn't any.
00:51:47.625,00:51:48.791,No sex at all.
00:52:04.791,00:52:06.791,These are our storyboards.
00:52:08.958,00:52:10.916,-All-- All these. -Oh.
00:52:11.166,00:52:12.958,"-Here. -Oh, thank you."
00:52:23.500,00:52:25.416,Some people are old fashioned.
00:52:30.041,00:52:31.125,He goes way back.
00:52:31.791,00:52:56.583,"The movie he's making now, A very dangerous breed, sweetie. One of them once killed a friend of ours."
00:52:57.333,00:52:59.666,We'll see what happens to our new boy tomorrow.
00:53:08.666,00:53:09.500,Miguel.
00:53:17.666,00:53:20.791,"That's Jake, aiming his gun at him in the shooting gallery."
00:53:25.666,00:53:30.041,"No bums, no movie buffs, no spies, no spooks, just..."
00:53:30.333,00:53:31.958,paid-up members of the club.
00:53:34.958,00:53:37.041,-Number one. -Till he got killed.
00:53:39.416,00:53:41.083,I just had one shot at him.
00:53:41.166,00:53:42.000,I missed.
00:53:44.500,00:53:45.833,Get that spook out of here.
00:53:48.041,00:53:49.666,Get out of here!
00:53:59.083,00:54:01.000,That thing doesn't work with solar energy.
00:54:01.083,00:54:02.625,I need some new music.
00:54:02.875,00:54:05.416,"And you shall have it, boy, wherever you go."
00:54:05.958,00:54:08.250,"A one, and a two and a three."
00:54:21.416,00:54:23.125,"Stupid, that's how they look."
00:54:24.291,00:54:25.125,Yeah?
00:54:27.083,00:54:29.291,"Oh, go on, then, Zimmie. Have a drink."
00:54:29.583,00:54:31.166,"Oh, how could I?"
00:54:34.041,00:54:34.875,Besides...
00:54:35.958,00:54:37.916,I don't know these people.
00:54:38.166,00:54:40.208,It's a whole new business.
00:54:48.000,00:54:49.416,I don't know their names.
00:54:49.916,00:54:53.666,You know the dummy's name? Old Pat here says we can never guess.
00:54:54.041,00:54:54.958,John Dale?
00:54:55.375,00:54:57.375,"Oscar, that was his real name."
00:54:57.833,00:55:00.041,"You know, at school, what he was famous for?"
00:55:00.125,00:55:01.250,Fornication?
00:55:01.625,00:55:05.583,We got somebody coming here tonight who's going to tell us all about it.
00:55:06.458,00:55:07.291,Yeah?
00:55:11.000,00:55:14.416,"It's for Pocahontas, or whatever it is Jake calls her."
00:55:14.500,00:55:16.375,"She's in there, at the screening."
00:55:16.458,00:55:19.250,"Come on in, Zimmie. Join the fun and games."
00:55:24.916,00:55:26.208,So is Mr. Dale.
00:55:26.500,00:55:28.583,"To look at him, you'd swear he was real."
00:55:36.333,00:55:40.750,From Zanuck. Call the secretary first thing Monday morning for an appointment.
00:55:40.833,00:55:43.625,-He's got a picture for her. -Darryl? Swell.
00:55:43.708,00:55:46.041,-When's he joining the party? -He isn't.
00:55:46.458,00:55:52.375,"The Hannaford mafia isn't looking very festive. What's-- -What's the big worry, Skipper? -They like to worry."
00:55:54.416,00:55:55.750,Worry is their thing.
00:55:55.833,00:55:57.333,Four days is a long time.
00:55:59.750,00:56:00.791,"Thanks, sweetie."
00:56:09.166,00:56:10.166,"Friday we, um..."
00:56:10.625,00:56:11.541,close down.
00:56:15.458,00:56:17.625,I've been overscheduled before.
00:56:17.708,00:56:18.750,Let's drink to that.
00:56:21.291,00:56:23.833,"How many times have you been broke, Skipper?"
00:56:25.166,00:56:30.541,"At my present age, Brooksie, um... just, um... once."
00:56:34.125,00:56:36.458,"Oh, terrific. It's nice being alone."
00:56:44.333,00:56:50.916,A small auxiliary generator from the stables has been hooked up to the movie projector.
00:56:51.291,00:56:55.750,If you'll all proceed quietly to Mr. Hannaford's private projection room.
00:56:57.291,00:56:59.333,They got the projector fixed. Didn't you hear?
00:57:00.500,00:57:01.750,Aren't you coming to the movie?
00:57:01.833,00:57:03.958,"Yes, but first we need a little more booze."
00:57:04.083,00:57:06.500,"We wouldn't want to go in there alone now, would we?"
00:57:06.583,00:57:07.666,Oh.
00:58:10.208,00:58:11.750,Excuse me.
00:58:12.750,00:58:16.333,He's in there. With all-- With all the other guests.
00:58:17.208,00:58:19.458,"Watching himself on the screen, isn't he?"
00:58:19.875,00:58:21.000,Isn't who?
00:58:24.416,00:58:26.750,"Yes, your leading man."
00:58:51.041,00:58:55.375,You've seen this before. How is it that they don't have any...
00:58:55.958,00:58:56.958,clothes?
00:58:57.125,00:58:58.083,They got wet.
00:58:58.583,00:58:59.583,In the other reel.
00:58:59.833,00:59:04.833,"-Wet? -She didn't know him, but she grabbed his raincoat. That was last night in this other reel."
00:59:05.458,00:59:08.166,And now it's today. She took off her clothes in the toilet...
00:59:08.791,00:59:12.291,"in here. And this morning, he's got his pants hung up to dry on the train."
00:59:12.750,00:59:13.958,Train.
01:01:23.666,01:01:24.625,Listen.
01:01:26.833,01:01:28.291,Somebody's watching you.
01:01:28.416,01:01:29.541,You can feel it.
01:01:31.625,01:01:33.250,There's somebody else out there.
01:01:40.541,01:01:41.958,Up there in that window...
01:01:42.625,01:01:44.333,there's nothing behind that window.
01:01:44.416,01:01:47.625,"They're all the same, there's somebody in there peeking down."
01:01:50.333,01:01:51.833,Did he drop the scissors?
01:02:04.750,01:02:05.958,She has her own ideas.
01:02:10.291,01:02:11.250,Kingman...
01:02:11.708,01:02:12.791,Branch Sutter...
01:02:13.583,01:02:14.458,Garvey...
01:02:15.250,01:02:16.958,Absent friends.
01:02:20.333,01:02:21.458,...and John Dale.
01:02:22.041,01:02:23.625,Not in the same league.
01:02:24.416,01:02:25.333,Believe me.
01:02:27.375,01:02:28.250,It's funny...
01:02:28.541,01:02:30.875,I don't see one of those men here at your party tonight.
01:02:33.750,01:02:35.458,"If you'll excuse us, please."
01:02:37.750,01:02:39.791,Ask Mr. Hannaford. He knows everything in Shakespeare.
01:02:39.875,01:02:41.666,"Shakespeare, that's the Hannaford family curse."
01:02:41.750,01:02:44.833,"He knows everything about the Hannafords, which is my curse."
01:02:45.166,01:02:47.166,Everybody knows about ol' Granddad.
01:02:50.958,01:02:53.875,His limbs were always covered in dirty pink tights.
01:02:53.958,01:02:55.708,"So as not to, um..."
01:02:55.875,01:02:58.625,inflame the female members of his audience.
01:02:58.708,01:03:01.375,"Right, Skipper? That's where the Shakespeare first comes from."
01:03:03.375,01:03:05.000,"on the ancestral throne, Mr. Hannaford?"
01:03:39.458,01:03:40.958,The noblest Roman.
01:03:41.833,01:03:42.708,Mm-hmm.
01:03:43.916,01:03:45.166,Shanty Irish.
01:03:48.375,01:03:49.500,Lace curtain.
01:03:50.500,01:03:54.291,"Like Seneca, he bled to death in the bathtub."
01:03:57.458,01:03:59.166,One of the few times he'd ever...
01:03:59.625,01:04:00.791,sat in one.
01:04:14.250,01:04:16.166,"Now, Junius Junior..."
01:04:16.291,01:04:17.458,"Yeah, he, uh..."
01:04:18.583,01:04:21.166,He really made it into high society. Piss-elegant.
01:04:22.750,01:04:24.333,Blazing the trail for the...
01:04:24.750,01:04:26.208,Kellys and the Kennedys.
01:04:30.833,01:04:33.583,"That's me, Skipper. That's me."
01:04:38.625,01:04:39.625,"Then, um..."
01:04:41.333,01:04:43.041,you know about the chandelier.
01:04:49.458,01:04:50.500,I'm the authority.
01:04:52.666,01:04:55.125,"The old Hollywood Hotel, was it?"
01:05:07.333,01:05:09.708,They found him one Sunday morning.
01:05:12.208,01:05:13.041,Hanging from it.
01:05:17.375,01:05:19.833,"After which, you had to go to work for a living."
01:05:22.166,01:05:23.625,"So, what do you do next?"
01:05:34.750,01:05:37.375,And he's on all the credits of Jake's screenplays.
01:05:37.500,01:05:38.333,Right?
01:05:38.458,01:05:40.166,I amuse Mr. Hannaford.
01:05:40.666,01:05:41.958,He has curious pleasures.
01:05:42.875,01:05:45.083,"Games, he likes to play games."
01:05:45.916,01:05:50.166,I'm a writer who stopped writing one afternoon in Budapest in 1929.
01:05:51.333,01:05:52.375,Do I have a camera?
01:05:54.083,01:05:55.125,Oh.
01:05:55.958,01:05:59.208,I'm prepared to make a limited declaration.
01:06:01.083,01:06:02.333,This famous...
01:06:03.000,01:06:08.291,"old lion of yours, -he's not what you think, you know? -Lions are cats."
01:06:08.708,01:06:10.625,"And Jake, my dear, is a cat."
01:06:11.500,01:06:13.208,A cat that walks like a bear.
01:06:13.708,01:06:15.416,I'd call him a necromancer.
01:06:16.583,01:06:19.208,But I do not know if he's raised the dead.
01:06:27.791,01:06:29.625,"Oh, there you are."
01:06:30.041,01:06:32.333,Yes. This gentleman...
01:06:32.625,01:06:33.833,kindly gave me...
01:06:36.041,01:06:38.083,Just stay there. Do you mind?
01:07:01.750,01:07:02.833,"Push him down, dear."
01:07:05.708,01:07:08.583,"Hold him down, choke him, drive that tongue in his throat."
01:07:08.666,01:07:09.541,Choke him.
01:07:11.333,01:07:12.416,"All right, sweetie."
01:07:12.500,01:07:13.583,You know where to go.
01:07:13.708,01:07:15.916,Let's have that tongue. Let's see it.
01:07:32.375,01:07:34.625,"Come on, sweetie. Slowly."
01:07:37.791,01:07:38.916,Slow...
01:07:51.541,01:07:52.958,Yeah. Go on.
01:07:55.250,01:07:57.750,"Listen, kid. Now you're getting your courage up."
01:08:02.250,01:08:03.416,Are you getting it up?
01:08:03.500,01:08:05.375,"Or are we fresh out of courage, kid?"
01:08:07.416,01:08:09.333,Okay. Now the necklace is caught in it.
01:08:10.250,01:08:11.958,"Give us the reaction, John."
01:08:22.916,01:08:24.625,You've gotta believe this could happen.
01:08:25.666,01:08:28.416,What if the truth isn't so goddamned impressive.
01:08:28.541,01:08:29.500,That's our secret.
01:08:30.041,01:08:30.958,Scissors.
01:08:35.250,01:08:36.875,Now she's going to cut it away.
01:08:40.083,01:08:41.208,"Snip, snip."
01:08:43.958,01:08:45.000,Snip it.
01:08:45.500,01:08:46.458,Cut.
01:08:49.291,01:08:52.333,"What has she cut, kid? Your little jewels, Johnny, or..."
01:08:53.666,01:08:54.500,hers?
01:08:54.750,01:08:57.708,"Let's feel that suspense, shall we? Come on, honey. Feel it."
01:08:57.958,01:08:58.791,"Suspense, baby."
01:08:59.250,01:09:00.541,Pure Hitchcock.
01:09:00.625,01:09:02.750,"If you'll pardon my language, sweetie."
01:09:02.833,01:09:04.166,"Hold still, Johnny."
01:09:04.708,01:09:06.291,"You can do that, can't you?"
01:09:11.541,01:09:12.375,Follow him.
01:09:14.291,01:09:15.833,Hold on him and keep rolling.
01:09:20.958,01:09:22.333,That's it. Hold it on him.
01:09:22.416,01:09:24.416,"And goodbye, Johnny Dale."
01:09:33.208,01:09:34.833,"Hey, look what you dropped."
01:09:35.083,01:09:38.625,Fifteen precious minutes of Hannaford. Every little bit...
01:09:38.708,01:09:42.166,"added to what we've got, makes it just that much more."
01:09:45.041,01:09:47.583,those spots were too much. Where's the circuit breaker?
01:09:51.458,01:09:52.833,"Oh, not again."
01:10:08.041,01:10:11.250,Good heavens. Who do you suspect? This cineaste?
01:10:11.333,01:10:13.500,He wouldn't know a cineaste from a hole in the ground.
01:10:13.583,01:10:15.291,Probably a midget with a grudge.
01:10:15.916,01:10:16.916,I saw your film.
01:10:17.291,01:10:19.208,You won't see any more of it tonight.
01:10:19.291,01:10:20.375,Why not?
01:10:20.541,01:10:22.958,"No lights, no projection, dum-dum."
01:10:25.958,01:10:29.958,"You will, kid. You will. Let me tell you what I think of it."
01:10:30.208,01:10:32.333,"Get us a drink, will you, sweetie?"
01:10:32.583,01:10:35.625,Just look for Jake Hannaford. He glows in the dark.
01:10:38.083,01:10:39.875,What you imitate is him.
01:10:40.458,01:10:43.083,"The man, not the movie; your idea of him."
01:10:43.166,01:10:47.625,"You know, the bull fights and the big game, the whole macho bit."
01:10:47.750,01:10:49.833,"Now, the truth of the matter is..."
01:10:50.458,01:10:53.291,"that as a macho, he ain't all that much."
01:10:53.583,01:10:58.375,That chest ain't near as hairy as he'd like you to think. Yeah.
01:10:58.916,01:11:02.125,Your guy's a big pink lobster.
01:11:02.791,01:11:04.000,Nothing's really tough.
01:11:04.541,01:11:05.791,Except the shell.
01:11:06.083,01:11:11.708,"Now what? I ask you what's so tough about you, and you ask me if I wouldn't like to find out. Then we..."
01:11:11.791,01:11:15.000,entertain the folks with a good old-fashioned Hollywood fistfight?
01:11:15.125,01:11:16.041,Well...
01:11:18.083,01:11:19.833,"if that's the way you want it, kid."
01:11:22.083,01:11:23.750,even in the way you do Hannaford.
01:11:23.833,01:11:26.333,"Maybe he was like that, 30 years ago."
01:11:26.583,01:11:28.666,I'll give him... 40 years.
01:11:29.708,01:11:32.166,My Jake can still lick the shit out of yours.
01:11:37.416,01:11:40.208,-What the hell did you do that for? -I wasn't even here.
01:11:40.500,01:11:41.958,"This is all going on film, you know."
01:11:52.416,01:11:55.416,"Putting a little extra zing on the old lobster's claw, Brooksie."
01:11:56.000,01:11:57.250,I'd do the same for you.
01:11:57.333,01:11:59.166,We imitation Hannafords...
01:11:59.541,01:12:01.041,have got to stick together.
01:12:01.250,01:12:03.875,I brought that schoolteacher. Remember?
01:12:04.333,01:12:06.166,You were supposed to bring Max David.
01:12:06.416,01:12:08.666,"Jake, I-- I gotta talk to you about that."
01:12:13.875,01:12:16.750,A couple of wranglers will take him to the local first aid.
01:12:23.333,01:12:26.125,"Please, if you're gonna have a fight, invite me."
01:12:30.458,01:12:32.250,Who told you I was broke?
01:12:37.666,01:12:38.500,Well...
01:12:39.541,01:12:40.416,Billy said...
01:12:40.750,01:12:41.916,you sold the boat.
01:12:42.041,01:12:45.083,"He did, did he? How about the roof over my head?"
01:12:45.208,01:12:46.416,How does that grab you?
01:12:46.666,01:12:47.833,You mean the ranch?
01:12:53.041,01:12:56.875,But let's not ever speak of Master John Dale again.
01:13:03.083,01:13:06.000,Dale! Dale.
01:13:06.375,01:13:09.125,"That's what really bugs you, isn't it? Dale."
01:13:09.500,01:13:12.166,All your troubles. What's one lousy leading man?
01:13:12.916,01:13:16.875,Less than the dust beneath my chariot wheels.
01:13:20.958,01:13:22.541,Cheers. I'll drink to that.
01:13:45.916,01:13:46.875,Right on.
01:14:10.166,01:14:13.208,"-What are you doing, Billy? Smoking? -What does it look like?"
01:14:16.500,01:14:18.291,"Nowadays, we call 'em a joint."
01:14:21.875,01:14:24.833,We know. That's to keep you off the juice.
01:14:26.708,01:14:27.875,He wants to see you.
01:14:31.166,01:14:32.625,"Well, I wanna see him."
01:14:32.750,01:14:37.625,I've got that teacher waiting. I wanna-- Herman the German.
01:14:40.333,01:14:42.208,"How's the boy? And you, Billy?"
01:14:42.333,01:14:43.750,"Jake, I just told you."
01:14:43.833,01:14:47.000,Kept you busy just collecting schoolteachers?
01:14:47.666,01:14:49.958,"Hey, can I please get myself something to eat?"
01:14:50.041,01:14:52.625,I wasn't just collecting schoolteachers.
01:14:52.833,01:14:54.250,Didn't they feed you?
01:14:54.375,01:14:56.666,All they do on airplanes is feed you.
01:14:57.083,01:14:59.166,Turbulence. Ooh.
01:14:59.833,01:15:01.125,You threw up.
01:15:01.875,01:15:03.666,"Give him some candy, Billy."
01:15:03.750,01:15:05.416,"Jake, those oil guys..."
01:15:05.500,01:15:06.875,Keep the voices down.
01:15:07.208,01:15:09.250,These freaks got the whole joint wired for sound.
01:15:09.333,01:15:11.458,I caught one of 'em bugging a cactus.
01:15:11.541,01:15:12.833,What about the old guy?
01:15:13.000,01:15:15.291,"Don't be bashful, Hermie. We know the answer."
01:15:15.375,01:15:16.541,They want no part of us.
01:15:18.000,01:15:19.416,Neither does Max.
01:15:19.875,01:15:21.500,"-Right, Billy? -Nah!"
01:15:21.875,01:15:23.166,"Max David, that dirty crook?"
01:15:23.250,01:15:24.583,-Who needs him? -We do.
01:15:25.041,01:15:28.791,"Max? He's so crooked, he's got rubber pockets so he can steal soup."
01:15:29.166,01:15:31.000,Our best chance was that oil money.
01:15:34.375,01:15:38.833,Brooksie. We wondered if you knew about the screening at the drive-in.
01:15:39.041,01:15:41.916,-We're screening the rest of the movie. -He's seen the movie.
01:15:42.375,01:15:43.458,Not everything.
01:15:45.041,01:15:47.041,"Well, we-- we don't have everything."
01:15:47.500,01:15:49.875,"Leave it to Jake, pretty soon you'll have too much."
01:15:50.083,01:15:52.375,"You bet, we've had our troubles before."
01:15:52.541,01:15:55.000,"Want your little friend to get you a drink, uh, Skipper?"
01:15:55.250,01:15:58.333,"-Thanks, Brooksie. -He's Max's golden-haired boy, isn't he?"
01:15:58.708,01:16:00.458,They gave Brooksie his own company.
01:16:00.625,01:16:05.000,-Come on. Tell us something we don't know. -I brought that schoolteacher.
01:16:05.125,01:16:07.208,Jake will see him if and when he feels like it.
01:16:07.500,01:16:09.000,What about Max David?
01:16:09.166,01:16:12.166,"That's who you were to bring out here, right after the screening."
01:16:12.458,01:16:15.458,He blew it. Must be all that candy he eats.
01:16:16.708,01:16:17.541,Me?
01:16:19.208,01:16:20.666,You were the one with Max.
01:16:21.500,01:16:22.458,Where is he?
01:16:24.750,01:16:27.333,And what the hell's the candy got to do with it?
01:16:27.500,01:16:29.250,"Could be it's softening your brain, Uncle."
01:16:29.333,01:16:31.375,It's for the sugar. You know that.
01:16:31.458,01:16:32.958,Since I got off that stuff.
01:16:37.583,01:16:43.875,"Speaking of which, here's little Mavis, who'll bring us a little fresh encouragement, um, won't you, sweetie?"
01:16:46.333,01:16:48.083,"I mean, if we're going to Mexico."
01:16:48.500,01:16:50.500,"Oh, we go as we are, sweetie."
01:16:50.833,01:16:52.375,Just as we are.
01:17:01.375,01:17:02.833,"Wasn't very smart, you know."
01:17:03.583,01:17:05.500,Poor-mouthing like that in front of Otterlake.
01:17:05.583,01:17:08.791,"-You know who he is, don't you? -Of course I do."
01:17:08.875,01:17:10.083,I've seen his pictures.
01:17:10.166,01:17:11.333,He's a big success.
01:17:14.125,01:17:16.333,His old man owns half the trees in Canada.
01:17:16.500,01:17:20.375,"Yes, and you know what Billy told him. He told him we're in trouble."
01:17:20.791,01:17:21.625,"Well, aren't we?"
01:17:23.000,01:17:25.500,"When you talk poor to the rich, they jump to conclusions."
01:17:25.583,01:17:28.125,They think we're getting ready for the touch.
01:17:28.208,01:17:29.666,And that's what we're doing?
01:17:30.708,01:17:34.208,Could have been the general idea until Uncle Billy loused it up.
01:17:37.000,01:17:39.166,"But, Mr. Hannaford, excuse me..."
01:17:39.541,01:17:41.958,Didn't I just hear you saying about Otterlake...?
01:17:48.166,01:17:51.166,"-of Brooks Otterlake. -Oh, hooray for you, buddy boy."
01:17:51.250,01:17:55.166,"I just wanna be helpful. From what I overheard, I understand there's thought of approaching him."
01:17:55.333,01:18:03.333,A word from me certainly couldn't hurt. He's bound to feel some gratitude-- Mr. Otterlake's a chum. We don't hustle our chums for dough.
01:18:03.416,01:18:05.083,We're kind of strict about that.
01:18:05.416,01:18:08.500,Always remember that your heart is God's little garden.
01:18:11.708,01:18:13.333,"-No. -Well, see that it isn't."
01:18:20.750,01:18:24.916,"Studying a man like Jake Hannaford, that's an experience."
01:18:25.000,01:18:27.500,Don't you miss it. Stick with the job.
01:18:32.916,01:18:35.125,"Eat a little shit, Mr. Pister."
01:18:45.791,01:18:46.750,Roger.
01:18:46.833,01:18:49.000,I did something I shouldn't have done.
01:19:00.250,01:19:03.583,"-But I saw him go into the library. -Well, it's groovier in here."
01:19:16.125,01:19:17.875,You know about Billy.
01:19:18.250,01:19:21.000,He's been on the program for nine years.
01:19:21.083,01:19:26.000,-What you wanna do that for? -What is the fundamental aesthetic distinction between a zoom and a dolly?
01:19:27.750,01:19:31.416,What possible difference can that make except to another dolly?
01:19:34.041,01:19:35.500,"-Ah, forget it. -What?"
01:19:38.125,01:19:38.958,Hi.
01:19:47.708,01:19:49.875,"This is the one that hurts, Brooksie."
01:19:54.750,01:19:57.375,This is a scene we both hoped we'd never get to.
01:19:58.666,01:20:02.500,"I don't think it's gonna play, not even for comedy."
01:20:06.791,01:20:09.541,"Uh, how much do you need?"
01:20:11.875,01:20:13.166,How much have you got?
01:20:15.791,01:20:20.291,"Hey, remember when you first appeared on that location of mine out in Iran?"
01:20:25.250,01:20:26.708,secondhand tape recorder.
01:20:26.791,01:20:28.250,A raggedy-ass kid.
01:20:28.833,01:20:29.708,When was it?
01:20:30.333,01:20:32.458,"Only... uh, four years ago."
01:20:40.458,01:20:41.333,mentioned...
01:20:46.208,01:20:47.333,"I know, kid."
01:20:49.958,01:20:53.666,It's only a distant hope. How's that for dialogue?
01:21:02.708,01:21:05.833,"You do the leaning, he's got to give."
01:21:10.500,01:21:12.166,And he hated every frame.
01:21:12.291,01:21:14.375,"He's an idiot, Jake. They're all idiots."
01:21:14.458,01:21:15.583,You know that.
01:21:15.666,01:21:16.750,He's your idiot.
01:21:19.083,01:21:23.666,"Don't be pompous, Brooksie. You made his company all that loot."
01:21:24.541,01:21:25.833,Christ knows I didn't.
01:21:25.916,01:21:28.375,"Oh, don't think I'm not ready to put up a fight for you."
01:21:28.875,01:21:32.291,-Want me to spare you the embarrassment? -It's you I'm thinking of.
01:21:32.416,01:21:35.041,"God, I don't want to have to listen to Max David..."
01:21:35.583,01:21:36.833,and all those stupid...
01:21:38.375,01:21:39.375,Turning you down.
01:21:41.041,01:21:43.625,"Don't give up the ship, eh, Brooksie?"
01:21:57.833,01:21:58.958,"Oh, sure."
01:22:00.000,01:22:02.833,Don't worry about me. You've got troubles of your own.
01:22:04.416,01:22:07.208,There must be plenty of work for a good makeup man.
01:22:07.375,01:22:08.583,I got a suggestion.
01:22:09.833,01:22:13.708,-It's what you can do with them dummies. -I know what I can do with them.
01:22:14.041,01:22:24.083,"Listen, Pat. You take them dummies, see, and you take this piece of iron pipe, and you slash and beat and chop away to your heart's content."
01:22:25.833,01:22:27.583,Or maybe give the pop to Jake.
01:22:28.916,01:22:31.708,"He'd feel a whole lot better off afterwards, believe me."
01:22:36.958,01:22:41.791,"-Is that so? -So, in order to graduate by January, I'd have to take one correspondence course."
01:22:49.000,01:22:51.041,-She doesn't want to pay that? -She won't sign for it.
01:22:51.125,01:22:52.083,Mr. Hannaford?
01:22:54.083,01:22:56.708,Dr. Bradley Pierce Burroughs.
01:22:57.041,01:22:57.958,Pease.
01:22:59.041,01:23:02.291,-Pease? -Bradley Pease Burroughs.
01:23:09.875,01:23:12.291,-Here you go. May I take your...? -Oh.
01:23:12.375,01:23:13.708,"Oh, yes. Thank you."
01:23:28.416,01:23:32.625,at the Frannahan Boarding Academy for boys.
01:23:33.166,01:23:34.000,Clivedale.
01:23:38.333,01:23:42.333,-That's the name of the school. -He also teaches Dramatics.
01:23:44.666,01:23:47.375,And who do you think was my star pupil?
01:23:47.875,01:23:50.208,"Of course, we knew him then as Oscar."
01:23:53.666,01:23:54.750,Oscar.
01:23:59.583,01:24:00.666,"Well, uh..."
01:24:04.833,01:24:09.041,"And... from the time he was first able to walk, he used to put on shows."
01:24:09.333,01:24:12.875,"You know, with his auntie's hats and gowns and dresses."
01:24:17.291,01:24:20.916,Supposedly Jake's idea. He practically forced him into it.
01:24:24.750,01:24:27.583,"in Acapulco, besides getting stoned?"
01:24:29.458,01:24:31.333,He made the trip just to see you.
01:25:00.083,01:25:02.958,Um... And the change of name?
01:25:03.250,01:25:04.250,"Oh, for that..."
01:25:04.750,01:25:06.791,I'm afraid we have to blame Oscar Wilde.
01:25:13.583,01:25:14.416,But...
01:25:14.916,01:25:15.750,we had this...
01:25:16.625,01:25:17.458,Yeah?
01:25:26.791,01:25:28.333,"You see, there was this, um..."
01:25:29.750,01:25:30.875,We had this teacher.
01:25:32.375,01:25:35.125,-He was just one of those little... -You mean he was a faggot.
01:25:37.000,01:25:39.083,This teacher was a faggot.
01:25:40.208,01:25:41.041,Well...
01:25:49.166,01:25:51.375,"Uh, Mr. Hannaford..."
01:25:57.916,01:26:00.291,This story concerns my school.
01:26:00.875,01:26:04.083,"I-- I'm in no position to, uh..."
01:26:05.208,01:26:07.500,-publish-- -Publish and be damned.
01:26:08.083,01:26:10.833,Look. We've run out of film.
01:26:11.916,01:26:13.708,"You can, uh, speak off the record."
01:26:15.333,01:26:21.500,"Dale was in no way involved, you know, but... among the boys... there was a..."
01:26:22.083,01:26:25.708,"great deal of morbid conversation, um..."
01:26:25.791,01:26:27.916,"I'm afraid, on unhealthy subjects."
01:26:30.083,01:26:33.875,"As you could imagine, with a name like Oscar..."
01:26:35.083,01:26:36.708,What happened to that teacher?
01:26:37.583,01:26:39.625,"-We let him go, of course. -Let him go?"
01:26:39.708,01:26:41.791,-Mm-hmm. -What about the police?
01:26:42.375,01:26:46.041,"Well, the man was sick, Mr. Hannaford."
01:26:46.125,01:26:47.750,But those young boys.
01:26:47.833,01:26:50.458,They must have been sick after he finished with them.
01:26:50.541,01:26:52.958,"Uh, I hope you're not worried about Dale."
01:26:54.500,01:26:55.666,You think I should be?
01:26:56.583,01:27:00.458,"Wouldn't that depend, Mr. Hannaford, on your own... personal interest?"
01:27:08.125,01:27:08.958,Nothing.
01:27:14.958,01:27:15.833,Nothing.
01:27:16.333,01:27:17.166,"No, no, no!"
01:27:19.125,01:27:21.958,"I'm just his director, not his Aunt Daisy."
01:27:22.333,01:27:23.750,And I'm just his English teacher.
01:27:32.833,01:27:35.041,"Certainly, he has every reason to be grateful to you."
01:27:35.125,01:27:40.708,"I'm sure that one day, when one of his fine performances gets the Academy Award, you'll be grateful to him."
01:27:41.416,01:27:44.500,Notice how careful he is not to refer to it as an Oscar.
01:27:50.958,01:27:53.375,"Would you like to take a dip, Dr. Burroughs?"
01:27:53.708,01:27:54.625,A dip?
01:28:00.458,01:28:03.583,A little more hooch would be helpful. I'll be right with you.
01:28:04.500,01:28:05.666,Good. Good.
01:28:16.166,01:28:18.458,-Where do I change? -Right here.
01:28:19.166,01:28:20.375,In the sight of God.
01:28:24.625,01:28:26.541,"We all promise not to look, hmm?"
01:28:34.458,01:28:37.875,"Yes, I suppose all schoolteachers are prigs."
01:28:38.333,01:28:39.500,I suppose...
01:28:40.250,01:28:42.125,Prigs or... faggots.
01:28:42.458,01:28:46.791,"-Now, now, Mr. Hannaford. -Now, now, Dr. Burroughs!"
01:28:57.000,01:28:58.250,"We were conned, Mother."
01:28:59.791,01:29:00.750,He was a fake.
01:29:03.125,01:29:08.125,"When Mr. John Dale was pulled out of the water, the famous would-be suicide."
01:29:08.208,01:29:09.541,Would-be suicide?
01:29:12.708,01:29:16.000,Would-be suicides ought to be treated like drunks.
01:29:18.625,01:29:20.541,Turns out he doesn't belong to you.
01:29:21.666,01:29:23.750,"The old Chinese business, remember?"
01:29:25.041,01:29:27.958,"You save a life, you own that life."
01:29:31.208,01:29:32.958,And Dale wasn't no suicide.
01:29:33.041,01:29:34.541,"No, he was an actor."
01:29:34.625,01:29:36.750,"And he wasn't drowning, he was auditioning."
01:29:37.041,01:29:39.500,"Jake, that boy didn't run away."
01:29:39.916,01:29:41.125,He was thrown away.
01:29:41.500,01:29:45.000,"Yes, Mother. And sweet, Holy Jesus, what a relief that was."
01:29:45.083,01:29:48.541,Like getting rid of an aching tooth or the monkey off your back.
01:29:49.333,01:29:51.541,A drug habit's something you've gotta kick.
01:29:56.708,01:29:59.625,"That boy is all washed up, Ms. Valeska."
01:29:59.708,01:30:01.708,The picture. Isn't that what matters?
01:30:02.375,01:30:09.083,"Well, we've got that footage of him bringing the clothes to her and all that wind. Right, Maggie?"
01:30:09.250,01:30:11.916,To the girl. What then?
01:30:12.083,01:30:14.208,The girl. What about her?
01:30:14.500,01:30:15.958,"Yes, what about her?"
01:30:16.291,01:30:18.916,-We're all interested. -Dale wasn't.
01:30:19.625,01:30:22.916,"And neither is Mr. Hannaford. That's funny, isn't it?"
01:30:23.750,01:30:24.708,A scream.
01:30:24.833,01:30:29.833,I'd just like to ask Mr. Hannaford if things wouldn't have been very different if Dale had been her lover?
01:30:30.750,01:30:34.458,"If they weren't lovers, doesn't that sort of spoil the pattern?"
01:30:38.250,01:30:39.166,You ask him.
01:30:44.416,01:30:48.333,"-Why don't you get lost? -Tonight, it's all on the record."
01:30:49.250,01:30:52.166,It's all hanging out. That's how Zarah wants it.
01:30:55.291,01:30:57.625,"-Not from me, from Zimmie. -Zimmie?"
01:30:57.958,01:31:00.666,-There's a card with it. -We ought to have a drink with Zimmie.
01:31:00.791,01:31:01.708,You fired him.
01:31:02.458,01:31:05.208,I always fire Zimmie. I fire Zimmie constantly.
01:31:05.708,01:31:09.541,"Anyway, it's my birthday. I always give the presents."
01:31:13.083,01:31:14.833,"He makes the gags, too."
01:31:16.000,01:31:17.750,Did he tell you where I should stick it?
01:31:18.000,01:31:19.625,"Oh, Zimmie's jokes."
01:31:25.250,01:31:28.958,Speaking of presents... have I got a present!
01:31:29.791,01:31:47.916,"Have a go at the dummies, Jake. They break even more easily than people.'' Ladies."
01:31:49.166,01:31:54.125,We are presenting an award to the other half of The Other Side of the Wind.
01:31:54.708,01:31:56.458,"The, um, better half."
01:31:56.875,01:31:58.125,A bone...
01:31:58.791,01:31:59.791,for Pocahontas.
01:32:00.583,01:32:03.166,A little curio we picked up somewhere.
01:32:04.083,01:32:07.833,A bit of our own pale-faced craftsmanship.
01:32:08.791,01:32:10.125,Indian bone.
01:32:11.458,01:32:16.125,The inscription goes back to before all this was movie country.
01:32:16.916,01:32:22.333,"Just after... gold was found, the Indian population dropped pretty quickly."
01:32:22.708,01:32:26.875,"And in ten years, about 90,000 of them..."
01:32:26.958,01:32:28.708,"just, uh, disappeared."
01:32:29.333,01:32:41.166,"Well, in those good old days, our gallant honky pioneers uh, used to cut off Indian ears and pickle them in whiskey for souvenirs."
01:32:42.166,01:32:48.541,"And on pieces of bone, like this, they'd, um, write funny little jokes."
01:32:49.000,01:32:51.500,I am off the reservation...
01:32:51.708,01:32:53.000,at last.
01:32:55.500,01:32:56.916,"And so are you, my dear."
01:32:58.125,01:33:00.958,Perhaps you'd like to present this to our leading man.
01:33:01.875,01:33:03.666,Right up his ass.
01:33:12.750,01:33:15.083,"What he creates, he has to wreck. It's a compulsion."
01:33:15.208,01:33:18.458,"Then, we must wait, my dear, for him to eat us alive."
01:33:19.000,01:33:21.250,"Unless, perhaps, you are a critic."
01:33:21.791,01:33:24.500,He does rather tend to push them to the side of his plate.
01:33:25.791,01:33:26.666,But others...
01:33:27.625,01:33:34.375,"we who glow a little in his lights, -the fireflies... -Fireflies. I'll drink to that!"
01:33:34.458,01:33:37.125,...he does quite often swallow whole.
01:33:38.458,01:33:39.583,It is a fact...
01:33:40.333,01:33:44.000,"that some of us, he chews on rather slowly."
01:33:48.708,01:33:52.416,"and give you, in its place, a simple law of physics."
01:33:54.125,01:33:59.041,No machine ever produces as much as it consumes.
01:34:02.500,01:34:07.083,"in his suite in the old Hollywood Hotel, hanging from a chandelier."
01:34:43.875,01:34:45.041,just before dawn.
01:34:46.583,01:34:47.666,Not yet.
01:34:48.708,01:34:50.125,"Flashback, Mavis."
01:34:51.250,01:34:53.750,An old-fashioned flashback.
01:34:55.000,01:34:56.166,We're out on the boat.
01:34:57.208,01:35:00.208,And we just happened to notice somebody drowning.
01:35:00.958,01:35:04.208,Trying to. A young punk nobody ever heard of.
01:35:05.166,01:35:06.125,John Dale.
01:35:07.625,01:35:09.000,They've heard of him now.
01:35:09.583,01:35:10.625,Yes.
01:35:11.500,01:35:16.083,"How's this? After we dried him out, we tried to get him interested in staying dry. But no."
01:35:16.500,01:35:18.125,"Oh, we know the story."
01:35:18.625,01:35:19.458,Backwards.
01:35:20.958,01:35:23.291,I just can't get him interested in anything.
01:35:23.833,01:35:26.916,"Put me in a movie, make me a movie star."
01:35:27.041,01:35:28.416,What does that prove?
01:35:32.041,01:35:33.625,"What does it prove, Mavis?"
01:35:35.708,01:35:37.041,Bores him to death.
01:35:39.666,01:35:42.166,But he stops trying to die. I cured him of that.
01:35:42.708,01:35:44.958,Master Johnny just...
01:35:45.041,01:35:50.500,kicks me sharply in the groin and walks away.
01:35:55.375,01:35:58.083,We were speaking of suicides.
01:36:09.125,01:36:10.958,Want me to bring you another scotch?
01:36:27.875,01:36:29.791,"What can I do for you, Ms. Rich?"
01:36:32.333,01:36:33.375,Or why.
01:36:33.458,01:36:35.583,I wouldn't even begin to try.
01:36:36.833,01:36:39.500,"After Monday, I won't have to worry about it."
01:36:39.958,01:36:41.166,What does that mean?
01:36:42.083,01:36:42.916,Guess.
01:36:43.875,01:36:44.750,I don't want to.
01:36:45.750,01:36:47.541,It sounds like you are quitting.
01:36:50.041,01:36:51.333,You wouldn't do that.
01:36:52.083,01:36:53.500,It's Chapter 11.
01:36:54.541,01:36:55.583,We're finished.
01:36:56.791,01:36:58.000,See you around.
01:36:59.708,01:37:04.208,"He's got that meeting with the bankers in New York, so he's going straight to the airport."
01:37:04.291,01:37:06.666,He was supposed to fix it with the drive-in theater.
01:37:06.791,01:37:09.375,"For the screening? Yeah, he's stopping there first."
01:37:09.791,01:37:13.041,"Good. But, Jake said we shouldn't tell too many people."
01:37:13.625,01:37:14.500,I won't.
01:37:14.625,01:37:17.250,There ain't much left of this party as it is.
01:37:21.208,01:37:22.041,Jesus.
01:37:22.750,01:37:24.833,"Up the fireflies, eh, Billy?"
01:37:24.916,01:37:25.833,Right on!
01:37:46.583,01:37:51.291,"I'm sorry, J.J. It's almost time to go to the drive-in to screen the rest of the picture."
01:38:16.125,01:38:17.208,Sounds like shooting.
01:38:17.791,01:38:19.375,"Baron, I'm surprised at you."
01:38:20.166,01:38:22.625,"That's a lousy line of dialogue, and you know it."
01:38:27.541,01:38:29.250,"Fastest gun in the West, folks."
01:38:30.125,01:38:32.625,Jake? What the hell are we doing?
01:38:32.708,01:38:34.208,We're having a party!
01:38:49.500,01:38:52.916,From your boss. He says you'll know what to do with it.
01:39:07.000,01:39:09.083,She's sure as hell off the reservation tonight.
01:39:10.000,01:39:12.916,But what I want to know is who the hell she's aiming at.
01:39:15.291,01:39:20.416,"If I know anything about Ol' Master Jake, that red-skinned lady is supposed to be aiming at the dummies."
01:40:08.458,01:40:11.208,They're shooting Roman candles on the roof.
01:40:17.166,01:40:18.541,Neorealists.
01:40:19.208,01:40:21.083,"And the grand old new wave, sir."
01:40:24.250,01:40:27.833,-What's all that about? -I thought you knew about the midgets.
01:40:28.000,01:40:29.958,What's there to know about midgets?
01:40:30.208,01:40:34.750,"Ah, they broke into the wine cellar, now they got their tiny little hands on the fireworks."
01:40:34.916,01:40:38.166,-They are going to spoil the party. -Jake's done that already.
01:40:38.250,01:40:41.291,Goddard has just set up a government in exile. Just a minute.
01:40:43.041,01:40:44.708,"See, I told you, it wasn't much of a joke."
01:40:50.708,01:40:51.541,Artillery.
01:40:52.208,01:40:53.125,The heavy stuff.
01:40:53.208,01:40:55.625,Is the children and womenfolk safe?
01:40:55.791,01:40:58.375,Safe? Someone's shooting at me.
01:40:58.458,01:40:59.833,-They're in the stockade? -Stockade?
01:40:59.916,01:41:01.375,-What? -Stockade?
01:41:01.458,01:41:02.416,That's what I said.
01:41:03.291,01:41:05.291,"All right now, attention, everybody."
01:41:05.375,01:41:16.791,"Mr. Hannaford's motion picture will continue projection in the Magnolia Gardens drive-in movie theater, which has been specially hired for the occasion, at the corner of El Dorado and Getty."
01:41:16.875,01:41:19.333,Just one block south of the freeway.
01:41:19.416,01:41:20.875,No tickets required.
01:41:21.083,01:41:22.208,Another Hannaford shot?
01:41:24.291,01:41:26.000,on the route to Los Angeles.
01:41:26.083,01:41:32.125,"So, all you that missed the closing reels can now view this material from the comfort of your own cars."
01:41:32.625,01:41:34.208,Thank you and goodnight.
01:41:34.625,01:41:37.041,"Well, if Bastolucci doesn't surrender now..."
01:41:37.125,01:41:38.166,Bertolucci.
01:41:38.583,01:41:50.916,"Slice him how you want to, the one with the blue tennis shoes? You see her?"
01:41:55.541,01:41:56.541,It's Governor Reegan.
01:41:56.625,01:41:57.833,"-Reagan. -That's who, Reegan."
01:41:58.041,01:41:59.250,-Reagan. -Reegan.
01:41:59.333,01:42:00.666,"-Reagan. -Reegan, Reagan."
01:42:04.125,01:42:12.375,"Approached by a video-freak with an indecent suggestion, just as he was sneaking across the state line, Ronnie's wig... flipped."
01:42:12.833,01:42:14.875,Is he still governor? Governor?
01:42:15.208,01:42:20.125,Yep. He has decreed a state of emergency and thrown himself on the mercy of central casting.
01:42:29.791,01:42:35.083,has been arrested for denigrating all over a daughter of the American Revolution.
01:42:35.750,01:42:38.208,"Jessel is demanding equal time. Here, catch."
01:42:39.708,01:42:42.916,Five of our best biographers have just gone over to Preminger.
01:42:45.125,01:42:45.958,What?
01:42:51.208,01:42:53.208,please come down and move it?
01:42:57.916,01:43:00.541,I wonder if our leader has any idea who that belongs to?
01:43:01.458,01:43:02.833,"No, but he paid for it."
01:43:02.958,01:43:05.000,-What? -It was supposed to be Dale's.
01:43:05.125,01:43:07.666,-Wow. -We weren't giving him much of a salary.
01:43:07.750,01:43:10.208,He would have got that as a bonus when he finished the picture.
01:43:10.791,01:43:12.458,"He didn't, so he doesn't. Hmm?"
01:43:17.083,01:43:28.708,"Marlon Brando, who, by the way folks, is not pregnant, has gone underground and is doing splendid work for all of us, under the name of Tokyo Rose."
01:43:29.416,01:43:31.875,"Chin up, Brooksie! They haven't got us yet."
01:43:35.125,01:43:38.083,"Here's a lady tells us we've got to stick together, Jake and I."
01:43:38.208,01:43:41.208,"The farther you're apart, the harder it will always be to hide."
01:43:41.291,01:43:44.875,"-What would we be hiding, lady? -How much you really hate each other."
01:43:46.625,01:43:48.208,You've got it slightly wrong.
01:43:49.083,01:43:49.916,Yes?
01:44:32.583,01:44:34.583,I hope Jake's one of your customers.
01:44:35.000,01:44:36.000,That's the idea.
01:44:38.000,01:44:38.833,Of course.
01:44:40.625,01:44:44.250,"I wouldn't give much for the rest of them. But he... Lucky he's got you, Baron."
01:44:44.666,01:44:46.291,"Oh, he'll get along without me."
01:44:48.833,01:44:49.833,What does that mean?
01:44:53.583,01:44:55.666,I'm getting much too old for my job.
01:44:56.291,01:44:57.500,If you can call it that.
01:44:58.208,01:44:59.166,Nonsense.
01:44:59.375,01:45:01.625,What I wouldn't give for somebody like you.
01:45:01.875,01:45:03.250,I'm not on the market.
01:45:04.208,01:45:05.333,You never were.
01:45:05.916,01:45:08.708,"Even for the neutral observer, there is a price."
01:45:09.708,01:45:11.166,"Not worth it for you, though."
01:45:11.750,01:45:13.750,You're not quite tough enough for that.
01:45:14.291,01:45:15.125,Not yet.
01:45:16.625,01:45:19.166,"But who knows, Mr. Otterlake? Perhaps you will be."
01:45:20.625,01:45:23.375,"And where will that put me, Baron, in your estimation?"
01:45:23.958,01:45:25.166,Where do you want to be?
01:45:26.958,01:45:29.250,"No, what you need, now and always..."
01:45:29.500,01:45:32.708,"are the soldiers, the good soldiers."
01:45:34.125,01:45:35.458,Men like Billy.
01:45:36.708,01:45:41.666,"They followed Hannibal and Napoleon, they really crossed the Alps."
01:45:43.208,01:45:45.500,They are the heroes in any story.
01:45:48.208,01:45:49.541,Is there a movie in it?
01:46:40.750,01:46:42.458,Someone must have given you the wrong reel.
01:46:59.500,01:47:00.333,Well...
01:47:06.583,01:47:07.625,Well...
01:47:09.125,01:47:10.375,"You're right, I suppose."
01:47:11.750,01:47:13.125,It doesn't matter at all.
01:47:17.875,01:47:20.333,But this rough magic he here abjures.
01:47:21.083,01:47:22.958,"Take back that last, it doesn't fit."
01:47:26.958,01:47:29.083,-You went to Harvard. -Give up.
01:47:31.375,01:47:32.541,Is that a suggestion?
01:47:33.541,01:47:35.458,"Abjure, he knows what it means."
01:47:36.250,01:47:38.750,I gave up in the seventh grade.
01:47:39.541,01:47:40.500,How about you?
01:47:44.125,01:47:44.958,Never.
01:47:46.083,01:47:47.083,Not even now.
01:47:51.458,01:47:53.708,And I didn't learn my Shakespeare at Harvard.
01:47:54.625,01:47:56.500,Mr. Otterfield here...
01:47:57.208,01:48:00.458,"wanted to be an actor, then he saw one of my films."
01:48:00.708,01:48:02.500,We all read the interview.
01:48:03.791,01:48:05.791,"He is a rough magician, isn't he?"
01:48:08.125,01:48:09.750,You can kiss my sweet ass.
01:48:11.000,01:48:12.583,"What did I do wrong, Daddy?"
01:48:17.958,01:48:18.916,Our revels...
01:48:20.208,01:48:21.291,now are ended.
01:48:23.625,01:48:25.083,You bet your sweet cheeks.
01:48:33.916,01:48:36.041,We had to hire this drive-in for the whole night.
01:48:36.125,01:48:38.666,"Somebody had to make the arrangements, didn't they?"
01:48:38.791,01:48:40.416,It's on the way back to town.
01:48:43.416,01:48:44.416,Give me a ring.
01:48:44.916,01:48:46.708,-This station wagon. -What about it?
01:48:47.000,01:48:48.125,It belongs to Jake.
01:48:48.833,01:48:51.000,Where shall I pick it up? At Universal?
01:48:51.166,01:48:52.708,It goes back to the dealer.
01:48:53.375,01:48:54.208,Yes.
01:49:02.875,01:49:03.916,For John Dale.
01:49:04.416,01:49:05.875,When he finished the picture.
01:49:10.458,01:49:12.958,Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
01:49:15.000,01:49:16.208,What's with Billy?
01:49:16.291,01:49:17.875,He ran out of gumdrops.
01:49:44.291,01:49:45.541,"Going, so soon, honey?"
01:49:46.500,01:49:47.333,Yes.
01:49:47.708,01:49:49.416,"Wasn't much fun for you, was it?"
01:49:50.125,01:49:50.958,Goddamn midgets.
01:49:51.750,01:49:52.625,Friends of yours?
01:49:57.625,01:50:00.541,"She doesn't like you, kid. That's why she gave the party."
01:50:00.625,01:50:03.375,She figures I don't relate enough to the younger generation.
01:50:04.083,01:50:05.333,Just through you.
01:50:05.583,01:50:06.541,"But I do, you know."
01:50:06.958,01:50:08.541,I relate all I need to relate.
01:50:19.583,01:50:20.458,"Hey, beautiful."
01:50:20.583,01:50:24.833,Couldn't we fix it to see each other just a little bit less seldom?
01:50:26.041,01:50:27.250,With an old friend...
01:50:28.583,01:50:30.416,It's quite enough to know he's there.
01:50:31.916,01:50:34.125,"Like Gibraltar, the Eiffel Tower..."
01:50:35.916,01:50:36.875,Durability.
01:50:38.458,01:50:39.750,It can be rather fragile.
01:50:41.875,01:50:47.041,"Sometimes, to keep that feeling, we need to keep our distance."
01:50:48.791,01:50:53.625,The bad thing is to find out that a friendship was between a couple of other people.
01:50:55.291,01:50:56.375,"Thanks, Mother."
01:50:59.458,01:51:02.375,"You hear that? That's old Manolito, remember?"
01:51:13.708,01:51:16.166,We found him together. In Spain.
01:51:21.333,01:51:22.208,by the limo.
01:51:26.916,01:51:29.416,"Well, she'll have to answer a few questions first."
01:51:34.625,01:51:36.541,Say goodnight for me to your actress.
01:51:37.166,01:51:39.291,She was pretty good in there with that gun.
01:51:42.833,01:51:45.708,"The preferred target, I suppose, would have been me."
01:51:46.541,01:51:49.500,"Preferred by whom, Mr. Hannaford? You gave her the gun."
01:51:49.833,01:51:53.166,"Now, what does that mean? What's it supposed to mean?"
01:51:53.583,01:51:57.333,"Don't worry. Even if she doesn't know, she'll tell us."
01:52:00.000,01:52:02.416,you made just one film with Mr. Hannaford.
01:52:02.625,01:52:03.541,Yes.
01:52:03.625,01:52:05.916,That Garvey... Glen Garvey was your leading man.
01:52:06.000,01:52:11.375,"It is true, isn't it, that during the shooting of that film, Mr. Hannaford had an affair with Garvey's wife?"
01:52:12.375,01:52:18.416,"Men are the subject of his films. And whoever the man is, naturally, he's got a girl, right?"
01:52:18.666,01:52:23.083,"And whoever she is, somehow, finally, Hannaford seduces her."
01:52:24.250,01:52:28.416,"He must. He has to possess her, because it's the only way that he can possess him."
01:52:28.500,01:52:30.000,"We'll have to stop this, you know?"
01:52:32.791,01:52:37.541,"Expensive vice, isn't it? After he's had his actor's girl, he throws her away."
01:52:37.625,01:52:40.583,"And then he's thrown his actor away, and destroyed him in the process."
01:52:41.333,01:52:43.041,Maybe that's what you really want.
01:52:50.916,01:52:53.166,"Pick on someone your own size, motherfucker."
01:53:00.666,01:53:02.208,Who gives a shit?
01:53:06.583,01:53:11.583,"Before any of you creeps could put this stuff together, we'll have our own movie!"
01:53:12.000,01:53:13.833,A real movie!
01:53:21.958,01:53:23.083,She'll live.
01:53:23.875,01:53:25.708,"Yeah, she'll live to write about it."
01:53:33.291,01:53:34.208,Not yet.
01:53:58.166,01:54:00.083,They wouldn't let us point a camera at them.
01:54:00.625,01:54:02.833,They're certain that it dries up something.
01:54:09.291,01:54:12.583,"Could be it's an evil eye, at that. Medusa's."
01:54:30.208,01:54:31.041,Johnny?
01:54:32.916,01:54:33.750,So...
01:54:34.208,01:54:35.958,you came to my party after all.
01:54:39.541,01:54:41.250,"Get in, I'll drive you."
01:54:46.958,01:54:47.791,Chicken?
01:57:31.208,01:57:33.875,"maybe you can stare too hard at something, huh?"
01:57:34.583,01:57:38.416,"Drain out the virtue, suck out the living juice."
01:57:40.375,01:57:43.375,You shoot the great places and the pretty people.
01:57:44.875,01:57:47.625,All those girls and boys.
