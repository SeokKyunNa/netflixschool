00:01:16.125,00:01:18.500,two months before that really meant something.
00:01:19.625,00:01:23.000,"Oh, I'd love to say, I'm here to fight for freedom."
00:01:23.083,00:01:26.583,But honestly... I joined the Reserves for the college money.
00:01:27.750,00:01:31.042,I don't belong here. And I'm ashamed of that.
00:01:39.292,00:01:43.125,A war story can't be true unless it's got some shame attached to it.
00:02:31.917,00:02:33.042,What do you think?
00:02:35.000,00:02:36.708,Pokey was my dog's name.
00:02:36.792,00:02:38.958,Mirra Loma's the name of the street I grew up on.
00:02:39.041,00:02:40.041,Oh.
00:02:41.083,00:02:45.125,"It's my porn name. I'm going balls deep in Iraq, get it?"
00:02:45.208,00:02:46.708,"Yeah, yeah. Clever."
00:02:46.792,00:02:48.708,That coming off?
00:02:48.792,00:02:52.292,"-Yeah. Yeah, headin' that way. -Just in time. Armored's rollin' out."
00:02:52.375,00:02:54.833,"This place will be a ghost town. Ticktock, ticktock. Right?"
00:02:56.625,00:02:57.625,Right.
00:02:57.708,00:03:01.708,"Hey, if I don't see you for the rest of the war, be safe."
00:03:03.000,00:03:04.000,You too.
00:03:20.042,00:03:21.125,A little pressure.
00:03:25.917,00:03:28.292,"Scale of one to ten, how's the pain?"
00:03:32.083,00:03:35.833,"Whatever the suggested dose, double it. That'll handle the discomfort."
00:03:37.708,00:03:40.208,I can't even make a fist. I can't roll out like this.
00:03:41.208,00:03:42.625,Let me see your hand.
00:03:46.583,00:03:48.958,-A door did that? -Yeah.
00:03:50.250,00:03:52.292,I've seen guys rollin' out with a lot worse.
00:04:00.667,00:04:02.083,"When you're in Baghdad, it's really quite..."
00:04:02.167,00:04:03.417,"That a boy, Enzo."
00:04:10.667,00:04:18.542,"I'm telling you guys, I'm gonna be on the cover of Men's Health, fuckin' two big-old-tittied chicks on each arm, waves splashing on my pecs and shit."
00:04:18.625,00:04:25.500,"Chutsky, we're gonna see you on the cover of Out Magazine with a dick in each hand and shame in your eyes. Like this."
00:04:27.000,00:04:28.417,"Hey, you smell that?"
00:04:31.250,00:04:32.833,"Oh, hey, Ocre."
00:04:36.458,00:04:38.042,That malaria pill is giving me nightmares.
00:04:39.625,00:04:42.458,So... what'd the doc say?
00:04:43.542,00:04:44.667,Yeah. I'm good.
00:04:48.250,00:04:50.792,-Did you see Armored's rolling out? -Come again?
00:04:50.875,00:04:52.625,Whoa! Is that true?
00:04:52.708,00:04:54.792,Yeah. And I saw Cole loading the Abrams.
00:04:55.375,00:04:57.417,"Sergeant Harper, are we staging?"
00:04:57.500,00:04:58.625,"I know what you know, Chutsky."
00:04:58.708,00:05:00.458,Come on. What do I know? Tell me what I know.
00:05:00.542,00:05:02.375,"Hey, Sarge, if we are staging, we should start moving."
00:05:02.458,00:05:04.667,"Guys, Command will let us know when they're ready."
00:05:04.750,00:05:07.542,"Army's kept me in a cage for six weeks, Sergeant Harper."
00:05:10.625,00:05:11.875,So how's the hand feel?
00:05:14.375,00:05:15.958,-It's not a problem. -Okay.
00:05:31.167,00:05:32.250,"Get the stick, huh?"
00:05:40.458,00:05:41.625,What are you doing here?
00:05:44.500,00:05:46.375,"Uh, whatever you tell me to, Sergeant."
00:05:49.917,00:05:51.083,You're a smart guy.
00:05:52.167,00:05:53.833,Smarter than most of these boys.
00:05:53.917,00:05:56.500,"Why aren't you being all the fuck you can be somewhere else, huh?"
00:05:56.583,00:05:59.375,"Well, uh, it was laundry day when I signed up."
00:06:04.750,00:06:05.750,"Come on, Ocre."
00:06:08.667,00:06:10.708,"I don't know. My dad was in, my granddad."
00:06:10.792,00:06:12.083,"Something you did, you know?"
00:06:16.917,00:06:17.958,As you were.
00:06:19.042,00:06:22.542,"Hooah, Sergeant Major. Which way is the shit rolling, Lieutenant?"
00:06:22.625,00:06:24.667,"Downhill, as always."
00:06:26.417,00:06:28.375,We're being moved up the manifest.
00:06:28.458,00:06:31.167,"Chalk Two packs as slow as my fuckin' wife, apparently."
00:06:31.250,00:06:34.375,"Roger that, sir. We're gonna be about an hour till we're square here."
00:06:34.458,00:06:36.000,"Well, better make it 30."
00:06:37.792,00:06:38.833,You boys proud and ready?
00:06:38.917,00:06:41.542,"Proud and ready, Sergeant Major. Proud and ready."
00:06:43.167,00:06:47.333,"Yeah, you got that right. Beautiful goddamn day for the infantry."
00:07:05.208,00:07:08.458,"little baby-faced, wet-nosed puppy dog, Care Bear motherfucker right here?"
00:07:12.125,00:07:19.958,"So I'm looking up, and I swear to God, just as the first fireworks went off, Mitch comes flying through the front door, face bloodied, mangled, just all messed up."
00:07:20.042,00:07:23.000,"And then out of the corner of my eye, I see this white flash comin'."
00:07:23.083,00:07:24.125,I look over.
00:07:24.208,00:07:27.625,It's Burton taking a running leap off my front porch.
00:07:27.708,00:07:30.375,"Came down on him with the knee, like this. Boom!"
00:07:30.458,00:07:36.167,"He grabs him by the ponytail, drags him to the middle of the street and beat the brakes off of this grown man."
00:07:36.250,00:07:38.500,"I mean, he hit him with shit I ain't never seen before."
00:07:38.583,00:07:40.958,"-What, and everyone just watched? -Yeah."
00:07:43.792,00:07:47.125,"Bottom line, his mom took care of me when I was a kid."
00:07:47.208,00:07:48.208,Yeah.
00:07:48.292,00:07:51.500,This guy was a piece of shit. He got what was coming to him.
00:07:52.833,00:07:55.875,"You need, like... like, anger management for that."
00:07:59.625,00:08:00.958,"Well, I got really into Pilates."
00:08:01.042,00:08:03.875,"Roger that, Noble Lion. We are ready to go. Over."
00:08:05.875,00:08:08.167,"Guys, game on. Let's go. Come on."
00:08:08.917,00:08:10.708,"Baghdad or bust, bitches."
00:08:21.542,00:08:22.958,Cigarette?
00:08:23.042,00:08:24.917,"No, I'm good, thanks. Don't smoke."
00:08:26.583,00:08:28.708,-Keep me safe up there. -You know it.
00:08:35.500,00:08:40.375,"Whoever built that berm, if they ain't scared, they're gonna get scared."
00:08:40.458,00:08:42.375,Double time!
00:08:43.083,00:08:44.625,March!
00:09:06.208,00:09:08.708,"All right. Well, you're gonna have to flank."
00:09:08.792,00:09:11.917,"All right. Well, Charlie team's got a... a team across the way."
00:09:12.000,00:09:13.208,Maybe I could flank with them.
00:09:13.292,00:09:15.125,"Oh, Chutsky, you want it? Go get it, boy."
00:09:15.208,00:09:16.208,"-Hey, Burton. -Yeah?"
00:09:18.042,00:09:20.125,"Hey, hey, hey, but don't bum-rush the guy, okay?"
00:09:20.208,00:09:22.000,Command does not want us destroying a mosque.
00:09:22.083,00:09:23.375,-It's gonna be a bad PR problem. -Fuckin' liberals.
00:09:23.458,00:09:26.542,I don't think it's coming from the mosque. I saw muzzle flashes behind it.
00:09:30.917,00:09:32.958,"I, uh... I think he's in the hotel."
00:09:33.042,00:09:34.958,Hotel. I'm gonna take the kid.
00:09:45.833,00:09:48.542,Fuck! Shit. Fuck me!
00:09:52.458,00:09:54.542,"Go, go, go, go, go, go!"
00:09:57.958,00:09:59.667,Where's the CO?
00:10:13.000,00:10:16.250,"Bravo, with me. All right, on me!"
00:10:21.292,00:10:22.292,Move.
00:10:25.708,00:10:26.708,Move.
00:10:32.083,00:10:33.083,Set.
00:10:34.000,00:10:35.708,"Move, move, move, move, move, move, move!"
00:11:08.083,00:11:10.500,"Ocre, cover fire! Out the window."
00:11:12.250,00:11:14.625,"All right. Ocre, cover fire."
00:11:14.708,00:11:16.542,"I got ya. I got ya. Oh, you're good."
00:11:19.292,00:11:22.500,Just quit your bellyaching. You're fine. Just a little gun wound.
00:11:22.583,00:11:25.292,"All right, help me out here. Help me out. God damn."
00:11:26.875,00:11:28.292,"Yeah, we're fine. We're fine."
00:11:28.375,00:11:29.958,"-All right, Ocre, you're with me. -Yeah."
00:11:30.042,00:11:31.458,"You, follow me."
00:11:49.000,00:11:51.625,"Noble Lion, this is Eagle One. Do you copy?"
00:11:56.125,00:12:00.000,"Sniper fire is not coming from the mosque. I repeat, not the mosque."
00:12:00.083,00:12:02.042,It is confirmed from the hotel.
00:12:02.125,00:12:05.542,"It is, uh, 260 degrees and..."
00:12:05.625,00:12:07.250,"What is it, about 100 meters from the mosque?"
00:12:07.333,00:12:08.750,Hundred and fifty.
00:12:08.833,00:12:11.875,And 150 meters from the mosque. Over.
00:12:15.000,00:12:17.708,"Do you have a floor number, Eagle One? Over."
00:12:19.250,00:12:22.417,"Wait, one... Yo, they want a fucking floor number."
00:12:23.333,00:12:26.125,"Floor number? Do they want a room number, too?"
00:12:26.208,00:12:28.042,Is this motherfucker ordering room service?
00:12:30.250,00:12:33.000,Get the fuck up top. Get 'em a fuckin' floor number.
00:12:37.250,00:12:39.000,-And watch your head. -Yeah.
00:12:49.625,00:12:52.791,"Yeah. Third floor, southeast corner."
00:12:53.583,00:12:55.875,"-You say third floor, southeast corner? -Yeah."
00:12:55.958,00:12:56.958,Fuck.
00:13:00.042,00:13:01.375,Fuck that!
00:13:05.875,00:13:07.417,Sniper fire is too heavy.
00:13:08.792,00:13:11.000,I'm suggesting an air strike. Over.
00:13:13.167,00:13:15.167,-What the hell are you doing? -What a clusterfuck of a...
00:13:15.250,00:13:16.458,Chutsky?
00:13:19.875,00:13:21.583,This whole thing is such a fucking clusterfuck.
00:13:21.667,00:13:25.083,"No. No, no, no. Sergeant... Hey, Sergeant, we're too close."
00:13:25.167,00:13:28.083,We're not too close. We're right where we need to be.
00:13:28.167,00:13:31.458,"Sergeant, how long do we have? Can I move? Do we have time to move?"
00:13:31.542,00:13:35.250,"No, we don't have time to fuckin' move. We called in an air strike. Stay put."
00:13:39.042,00:13:41.000,It's hot as shit. My balls are sweating.
00:13:41.083,00:13:43.500,Fuckin' salt stains under my arm and shit.
00:13:49.292,00:13:51.667,Keep your head down. We've got fuckin' backup.
00:14:06.458,00:14:08.792,"You lose, motherfucker!"
00:14:10.083,00:14:13.917,"Oh, fuck. That's why I'm in Baghdad. That's why I'm in fucking Baghdad!"
00:14:15.250,00:14:18.292,-Ocre! You deaf? -What?
00:14:18.375,00:14:20.958,Ocre! You about to puke?
00:14:28.333,00:14:29.833,"Whoo! We fuckin' did it, sir."
00:14:31.625,00:14:34.042,"Yeah, come on out, Chutsky. Walk out now. We're coming from the north."
00:14:35.667,00:14:38.250,"Ready them titties, Kansas City."
00:14:38.333,00:14:41.042,"Corporal Enzo, hero, will be home soon."
00:14:41.125,00:14:43.208,"Okay, right here. Right here. Right here."
00:14:44.875,00:14:46.542,"-Let's go. Dismount. -Yo, I'mma get all kinds of titties."
00:14:46.625,00:14:49.500,"Big titties, little titties, fuckin' medium titties."
00:14:49.583,00:14:54.917,"Oh, shit. I'll be straight up, man. Back home I was fucking threes, fours."
00:14:55.000,00:15:00.458,"After a story like this, I'm definitely fucking fives, sixes, maybe even a seven if I catch me a drunk patriot."
00:15:03.542,00:15:05.125,"Uh, we've got a WIA on the roof."
00:15:05.208,00:15:08.042,"Uh, Charlie Team Three's medevaccing him right now."
00:15:08.125,00:15:09.292,Ocre and I blew up a building.
00:15:10.917,00:15:11.958,"Good job, Private Ocre."
00:15:12.042,00:15:13.333,"Yeah, he can't hear you."
00:15:15.167,00:15:16.167,Come here.
00:15:18.375,00:15:20.000,How you feel?
00:15:20.083,00:15:21.708,Underpaid.
00:15:21.792,00:15:24.292,All right. I'll be sure to pass your complaint on to management.
00:15:24.375,00:15:25.417,Come on.
00:15:36.583,00:15:39.000,"Hey, don't let these little mini-jihadists get too close."
00:15:39.083,00:15:41.958,Fuckin' little bombs strapped all over 'em and shit.
00:15:47.875,00:15:51.250,"Primary mission, collect all primary intelligence requirements."
00:15:51.333,00:15:53.000,Bag it and tag it.
00:15:53.083,00:15:55.250,"Area has been cleared. But keep your head on a swivel, boys."
00:15:55.333,00:15:57.042,And welcome to your new home.
00:16:06.583,00:16:09.083,Is this a photo op or what? Take a picture.
00:16:11.958,00:16:12.958,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:16:17.542,00:16:19.667,"I gots to do this one. Yeah, boy!"
00:16:19.750,00:16:21.083,-Hey! Hey! -Bad motherfucker.
00:16:21.167,00:16:22.333,"Hey, knock that shit off. Come on."
00:16:22.417,00:16:23.875,"-Let's go, Corporal. -Sorry, Sergeant."
00:16:46.083,00:16:47.625,I'm taking off my pants now!
00:17:43.125,00:17:48.292,"in the coming weeks and months, that our credibility and the integrity of this country is in jeopardy?"
00:17:48.375,00:17:49.417,"Uh, I, of course..."
00:17:49.500,00:17:51.000,Did my guys roll out yet?
00:17:51.083,00:17:53.375,They're running behind. Having trouble with the load.
00:17:56.292,00:17:57.292,Thank you.
00:17:59.083,00:18:02.458,"Is that, uh, good? Good. Shukraan."
00:18:06.542,00:18:09.500,Burton! Do you remember Steph Bertolini? With all the ass?
00:18:09.583,00:18:11.792,"Oh, the, uh... That chick with polio?"
00:18:11.875,00:18:14.417,She did not have fuckin' polio! How many times we gotta go over this shit?
00:18:14.500,00:18:17.250,"It was, like, a leg thing or, like, she had, like, a baby foot or something..."
00:18:17.333,00:18:24.083,"Oh, my God, it... it couldn't have been polio, Because, asshole, I looked it up."
00:18:24.167,00:18:27.500,"Yeah, you looked it up 'cause you thought your girl had polio, so..."
00:18:27.583,00:18:28.875,"-Well, fuck you very much. -Here. Here. Here."
00:18:28.958,00:18:30.792,You know what? I'm hitting every pothole and every fuckin'...
00:18:30.875,00:18:32.208,Let's take a picture with this guy.
00:18:33.708,00:18:35.458,"-...he had weapons of mass destruction. -All right, Jim?"
00:18:37.417,00:18:39.375,"Uh, Eagle Four, this is Eagle Six."
00:18:39.458,00:18:41.875,"Whatever the delay, pick up the fuckin' pace. Over."
00:18:45.333,00:18:49.125,Why do you hate me when I love you so much? Over.
00:18:49.208,00:18:50.833,"Now, Corporal. Out."
00:18:53.250,00:18:55.542,"-All right, ready? -Come on, take it. Come on."
00:18:59.583,00:19:00.750,"-Yeah! Look at this... -All right, load him up."
00:19:06.792,00:19:09.417,"-All right, hop in, hopscotch. -No, I'm not going in the back."
00:19:09.500,00:19:10.500,Get the fuck in the car.
00:19:10.583,00:19:11.792,I'm the biggest. That doesn't make sense.
00:19:11.875,00:19:13.708,"Sergeant, Private. Get in the fucking back."
00:19:22.875,00:19:24.917,"-Just keep below the waist. -Yeah, great."
00:19:32.958,00:19:35.458,That shit's gay. Nobody's gonna fuckin' call you by it but you.
00:19:38.625,00:19:39.833,-That is badass. -That's why I said it.
00:19:43.000,00:19:46.416,"Shit. Hey! Hey, guys! Guys, he just moved!"
00:19:47.083,00:19:49.875,"Hey! Hey! Hey, he's not dead!"
00:19:51.208,00:19:52.791,-Hold up! -Open up! He moved! He's not dead!
00:19:52.875,00:19:55.083,Calm the fuck down. What are you talking about?
00:19:55.167,00:19:57.375,-He's fucking movin'. -What the fuck?
00:19:57.458,00:19:59.375,What the hell you talking about?
00:19:59.458,00:20:00.500,"-Oh, shit! -See?"
00:20:00.583,00:20:03.125,-Hey! Whoa! Are you crazy? -What the fuck?
00:20:03.208,00:20:05.958,"Will you put the gun down? It's 113 degrees, all right?"
00:20:06.042,00:20:08.250,He's thawing out. That's why he's jumping around like a catfish.
00:20:08.333,00:20:10.208,-You sure? -Will you chill out? Put that shit away.
00:20:11.875,00:20:15.083,"This shit ain't funny, Burton, man! I almost had a fuckin' heart attack!"
00:20:15.166,00:20:16.791,Mission came down.
00:20:16.875,00:20:21.250,"0200 this morning, an Apache spotted a weapons exchange."
00:20:21.333,00:20:24.208,Unleashed hell on a truck filled with RPGs.
00:20:24.291,00:20:25.750,"Hey, whereabouts are we talking?"
00:20:26.458,00:20:29.417,Small village up north. Outskirts of Baqubah.
00:20:29.500,00:20:32.208,"I mean, a Toyota filled with dead terrorists..."
00:20:32.292,00:20:33.708,"doesn't seem like a big problem, sir."
00:20:33.792,00:20:38.291,"No, the big problem is the big fucking hole we left in their water station when the Apaches fired on them."
00:20:39.791,00:20:44.125,Command wants some of our guys to attach to the SF team on the ground.
00:20:45.916,00:20:48.750,You'll report to a Captain Syverson and run water to the town.
00:20:49.500,00:20:55.583,"-What do you mean? Like delivery boys? -That, and we're giving you some capital to get the locals working with the engineers on the pumping station."
00:20:55.667,00:20:58.500,"Look, Lieutenant, everybody's been talking about going home."
00:20:58.583,00:21:03.750,And now you want us to go to some place we don't control. For what? A photo op?
00:21:03.875,00:21:05.250,Yeah.
00:21:16.750,00:21:18.833,You look like you went swimming.
00:21:18.917,00:21:22.875,"-There was no ventilation back there. -Oh, that's why I ride up top."
00:21:22.958,00:21:25.583,I see more of the country than anyone else.
00:21:25.667,00:21:27.875,"Nah. Nah, you couldn't pay me enough to ride the turret."
00:21:27.958,00:21:30.041,"We hit shit, all the fire's coming your way, buddy."
00:21:33.958,00:21:39.250,"But when we get home, I'll remember the breeze, sunshine."
00:21:40.000,00:21:42.875,"Like you'll remember sitting in the dark, sweating your ass off."
00:22:01.917,00:22:04.333,Special Forces? We don't do that shit.
00:22:04.417,00:22:05.708,That's true.
00:22:05.792,00:22:09.167,"Look, guys, I don't want anybody who's not fully on board. Okay?"
00:22:09.250,00:22:11.625,"You don't want in, you let me know, and I'll get you replaced."
00:22:11.708,00:22:13.833,"Oh, I think you should take the tampon out of your ass."
00:22:13.917,00:22:17.000,All right? I'm tired of this whole Green Zone shit.
00:22:17.083,00:22:18.083,I'm in.
00:22:21.208,00:22:24.917,"Hey. You go, I go. You want that on your conscience?"
00:22:25.916,00:22:28.916,Are you a grown man? Then make your own decisions.
00:22:34.916,00:22:36.708,Can we at least get the sat phone to call home?
00:22:36.791,00:22:38.833,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll make it happen."
00:23:05.500,00:23:09.042,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I was just calling my fiancée."
00:23:10.292,00:23:11.625,"Well, how is she doing?"
00:23:12.292,00:23:14.125,I got the... the answering machine.
00:23:15.000,00:23:16.833,You tell her much about Iraq?
00:23:18.416,00:23:21.625,"Only the stuff that won't worry her. I figure what's the point, right?"
00:23:21.708,00:23:22.958,Yeah.
00:23:23.042,00:23:25.000,"I mean, my mom thinks I work in the kitchen."
00:23:27.250,00:23:29.958,It's stupid. I told her everyone calls me Private Okra.
00:23:32.208,00:23:36.083,"Okay. But your dad, right? He was in. You could talk to him. He gets it."
00:23:37.166,00:23:38.875,He went AWOL when I was six.
00:23:40.500,00:23:41.541,That burn you up?
00:23:42.375,00:23:44.417,"No. No, I was too young."
00:23:44.500,00:23:46.708,"All I remember is, uh, the day he left..."
00:24:01.708,00:24:02.958,"What's on your mind, Ocre?"
00:24:04.292,00:24:07.750,"I was just, uh, thinking about this place they're sending us."
00:24:07.833,00:24:09.750,-Baqubah. -Yeah.
00:24:12.000,00:24:15.166,"You know, these small towns, we don't control them."
00:24:15.833,00:24:19.250,"Yeah, it's not all Yahtzee and flip-flops like it is here."
00:24:20.292,00:24:24.083,"And... you know, we destroyed their water supply, so they're not gonna be happy to see us."
00:24:24.167,00:24:27.250,"Yeah, but they will be when we get that water flowing again."
00:24:27.333,00:24:28.833,Right. Right.
00:24:31.167,00:24:34.250,I just think that there's a chance we're walking into something bigger.
00:24:34.333,00:24:35.958,I don't think I'm cut out for that shit.
00:24:37.750,00:24:43.708,"Burton's tough as nails, and Chutsky isn't afraid of anything. I... I'm-- Look, Chutsky sees a fire, he sticks his hand in it."
00:24:43.792,00:24:46.833,"I need somebody smart, somebody who sees the bigger picture."
00:24:55.583,00:24:57.083,And if I don't go?
00:25:01.000,00:25:03.542,"If you don't go, then I was wrong about you."
00:25:03.625,00:25:06.375,And I don't want anybody I was wrong about watching my back.
00:25:08.416,00:25:12.291,It's up to you. You can't come out here and outsource your decision to me.
00:25:17.833,00:25:22.250,"If you're in, here's the sat phone. You got a call to make."
00:25:32.875,00:25:34.875,"You ain't gotta look good. Just gotta do good, right?"
00:25:38.750,00:25:40.000,He's strange.
00:25:42.292,00:25:43.708,"Okay, where the fuck are your plates, Private?"
00:25:43.792,00:25:47.750,-There's not enough to go around. -But... Somebody cough up a plate.
00:25:47.833,00:25:48.833,"Here, take one of mine."
00:25:48.917,00:25:53.750,"No, Burton, you're top gun. That's not... Fuck. Chutsky."
00:25:53.833,00:25:55.792,"-Hey, Sergeant, I'm good-- -Just shut the fuck up, Ocre."
00:25:57.875,00:26:02.542,"So you gotta ask yourself, Am I more likely to get shot in the chest or the back?"
00:26:04.250,00:26:05.333,Choose wisely.
00:26:42.042,00:26:43.708,"-Morning. -Morning, Lieutenant."
00:26:45.291,00:26:46.333,Morning.
00:26:47.375,00:26:49.625,"The tank. Fasi, the driver."
00:26:49.708,00:26:51.666,Salaam. Sergeant Harper.
00:26:51.750,00:26:55.875,"IED attacks up and down the way, so maintain convoy integrity."
00:26:55.958,00:26:57.500,-Roger that. -No vehicles in or out.
00:26:58.125,00:27:01.458,Money in the back. And that's it. Load it up!
00:27:02.458,00:27:03.458,Get on it.
00:27:04.375,00:27:07.166,Oh. Enjoy Syverson. He's a blast.
00:27:13.458,00:27:14.792,"All right, look."
00:27:14.875,00:27:17.208,"Hide this up your asshole, I will split it with you."
00:27:17.291,00:27:20.583,Y'all wanna maintain 10 to 15 meters at all times. Thank you.
00:27:20.667,00:27:22.167,Enzo! Mount up.
00:27:25.208,00:27:28.291,"Dad's coming. Missed out on the fucking money, Ocre."
00:28:38.375,00:28:40.917,"Hey, Sy. Convoy's pulled up."
00:28:45.250,00:28:46.583,"Give me a moment, gentlemen."
00:28:58.125,00:28:59.583,Get that water flowing.
00:29:01.708,00:29:05.542,I say get back! Get back! Let's go! Let's go!
00:29:05.625,00:29:06.625,Get back!
00:29:08.000,00:29:11.792,"Burton, get those fuckers off that truck! Chutsky, come on!"
00:29:11.875,00:29:14.125,God fucking damn it!
00:29:20.125,00:29:21.917,Ocre! Ocre!
00:29:22.000,00:29:24.042,"-I want these people back! -I know. Yes, Sergeant."
00:29:24.125,00:29:27.208,-Stay down! -Get off the fucking truck!
00:29:27.292,00:29:29.833,"Get off! Stay there, okay?"
00:29:29.917,00:29:32.125,Let this kid through. Let this woman through.
00:29:32.208,00:29:34.708,Women and children first! Stay back!
00:29:44.583,00:29:47.750,"Hey. No, get back! Chutsky, you okay?"
00:29:47.833,00:29:50.750,Hey! Hey! Hey! Stay the fuck back!
00:30:02.833,00:30:04.875,"All right, guys, your job is real simple."
00:30:04.958,00:30:11.125,"You keep that water flowing, win their hearts and minds, and then the Iraqis start pointing fingers and giving me and the boys some targets to hit."
00:30:13.833,00:30:15.417,-Machmoud. -You got my 20?
00:30:16.667,00:30:18.083,This is Machmoud.
00:30:18.166,00:30:20.875,These boys are gonna fix your water problem.
00:30:23.042,00:30:24.583,Are there more?
00:30:24.666,00:30:26.000,"Yeah, isn't that a daisy?"
00:30:27.500,00:30:29.083,Go on. Get.
00:30:29.167,00:30:31.917,"But I want my 20, okay? Dollars, not dinars."
00:30:32.000,00:30:34.083,How about I pay you in freedom and democracy?
00:30:36.833,00:30:39.583,Taught that guy Texas Hold'em. Do not play him.
00:30:39.666,00:30:41.958,Turns out he's a goddamn prodigy. Come on.
00:30:58.250,00:30:59.542,This one's me.
00:30:59.625,00:31:02.000,Have you guys had much contact with the tribal leader?
00:31:02.083,00:31:05.125,Sheikh's a waste of time. You ladies are in here.
00:31:16.833,00:31:20.625,"Make no mistake, no one outside that gate wants you here."
00:31:21.250,00:31:23.375,So you do your job and turn those roars to a whisper.
00:31:24.708,00:31:26.000,"At night, we go dark."
00:31:26.083,00:31:30.166,"Snipers so much as see a bit of light, they will start popping shots."
00:31:34.333,00:31:35.458,Lovely.
00:31:35.541,00:31:37.250,Who wants the bunk by the window?
00:31:38.167,00:31:40.667,Ocre. You're up top.
00:31:54.500,00:31:55.917,Mission is water distro.
00:31:56.000,00:31:58.917,"Order of movement, three vehicles, two mil, one tanker."
00:31:59.000,00:32:00.833,"Vehicle number one, tanker. Number two."
00:32:03.000,00:32:04.667,Your route is as follows.
00:32:04.750,00:32:08.042,We are here. Pumping station is here.
00:32:08.125,00:32:12.667,"Distro points here, here, and here. Hit as many as you can."
00:32:13.292,00:32:14.708,Wheels up in five mikes. Any questions?
00:32:14.792,00:32:15.833,"No, sir."
00:32:15.917,00:32:17.583,All right. Let's go to work.
00:32:17.667,00:32:18.667,Roger that.
00:32:20.208,00:32:21.333,"Come on, mount up."
00:32:23.750,00:32:28.625,Hey. A positive. Me too.
00:32:34.875,00:32:37.208,How you doing? You good?
00:32:37.292,00:32:38.292,Yeah.
00:32:40.666,00:32:43.333,"Enzo, we're pulling out. Chutsky, we're moving."
00:34:09.083,00:34:10.500,Roger that.
00:35:01.458,00:35:03.042,Command said it's gonna take a couple of days.
00:35:04.667,00:35:07.458,but I'm standing here telling you two weeks for electrical and four for the pipes.
00:35:11.666,00:35:15.125,"I got 12 guys working in shifts. Half on guard duty, half on the pump."
00:35:16.041,00:35:19.833,We have to clear the debris before we can assess the extent of the damage to the pipes.
00:35:19.916,00:35:21.708,"You wanna go faster, roll up your sleeves."
00:35:21.791,00:35:25.000,"Yeah, well, we're only here to distribute the water, so..."
00:35:25.083,00:35:26.667,"But, hey, I got good news."
00:35:26.750,00:35:29.208,"We're gonna get you some workers, and we're gonna speed this up."
00:35:29.292,00:35:30.708,You got more guys on the way?
00:35:30.791,00:35:32.916,"Yeah, we'll get some Iraqis. We got cash to spend."
00:35:33.542,00:35:35.750,-That's the plan? -That's the plan.
00:35:35.833,00:35:38.208,-Pay Iraqis to work? -Yeah.
00:35:38.792,00:35:40.542,"You got a better plan, Sergeant?"
00:35:41.750,00:35:44.667,"You get me a couple dozen, it might cut your time in half."
00:35:46.958,00:35:48.500,"No, all the way up!"
00:35:49.250,00:35:51.166,It's taking forever.
00:35:51.250,00:35:53.375,That's as good as it gets.
00:35:53.458,00:35:56.750,"Well, can't you engineer, brain something up to make it go faster?"
00:35:56.833,00:35:58.083,No.
00:35:58.166,00:36:01.583,"All right, so hour each way. How long does it take to fill this thing?"
00:36:03.375,00:36:04.708,Three hours a trip.
00:36:04.791,00:36:06.166,Plus distribution time.
00:36:06.250,00:36:08.833,But the Iraqis line up fast. Should get their water fast.
00:36:08.917,00:36:11.625,"Okay, so four hours and three trips a day."
00:36:11.708,00:36:14.000,"I mean, we're still gonna be pushing sunset to be safe."
00:36:32.667,00:36:34.875,"We got a pickup truck, six o'clock!"
00:36:39.875,00:36:42.458,"Okay, Enzo, Burton, I don't want this guy getting in my convoy."
00:36:42.541,00:36:43.666,You understand?
00:36:44.875,00:36:47.083,"Enzo, this guy's gonna try to pass!"
00:36:47.167,00:36:48.208,Motherfucker!
00:36:52.625,00:36:54.083,Get the fuck back!
00:36:58.500,00:37:01.958,"Chutsky! This thing breaks, I want you descending on this guy."
00:37:02.041,00:37:03.208,Hold tight.
00:37:11.833,00:37:15.625,"I'm gonna fucking shoot! I'm gonna take a fucking shot, man!"
00:37:21.958,00:37:22.958,Let's go!
00:37:27.291,00:37:29.625,Get out of the car! Get out of the car!
00:37:29.708,00:37:32.708,"Machmoud, where the fuck are you? Machmoud!"
00:37:32.791,00:37:34.666,Get out of the car!
00:37:41.000,00:37:45.208,"Ocre, when I say get out the fuckin' vehicle, -it means get out the fuckin' vehicle. -I got stuck, Sergeant."
00:37:52.166,00:37:53.916,"Ocre, search him."
00:38:02.833,00:38:04.916,-He says his daughter is with him. -His daughter?
00:38:06.125,00:38:08.542,"Hey. Hey, there's a little girl back here."
00:38:19.292,00:38:21.625,and he's taking her to a relative who has an apothecary.
00:38:21.708,00:38:23.792,-A what? -An apothecary.
00:38:26.000,00:38:27.125,A pharmacy.
00:38:32.208,00:38:36.208,"Hi. I want you... I want you to stand right there -for me, okay? -It's okay. She's okay."
00:38:53.917,00:38:56.083,"Okay, you can step back in your car now."
00:38:59.916,00:39:01.125,"Chutsky, come here."
00:39:04.292,00:39:08.250,"Look, these... these people, they use kids as cover all the time."
00:39:13.208,00:39:14.833,I got a bad feeling about this guy.
00:39:31.000,00:39:34.625,"Okay. Ocre, cut him loose. Let's go, cut him loose."
00:39:37.833,00:39:39.416,"Look, this is, uh..."
00:39:39.500,00:39:41.958,"this is for your trouble and your little girl there, okay?"
00:39:42.041,00:39:43.333,We're sorry for the trouble.
00:39:45.042,00:39:47.667,"Okay, but hey, hey, hey. You can't drive this road anymore, okay?"
00:39:47.750,00:39:49.958,"I don't wanna see you on this road. Machmoud, tell him."
00:39:55.541,00:39:58.416,-What'd he say? -He doesn't want the money.
00:39:59.375,00:40:00.541,"Enzo, get the door."
00:40:09.333,00:40:10.583,Ocre. Ocre.
00:40:10.666,00:40:12.125,You need an invitation? Come on.
00:40:12.208,00:40:13.791,Move your fuckin' ass. Let's go.
00:40:25.125,00:40:29.208,We will be distributing water at this location every day at 10:00 a.m.
00:40:33.333,00:40:39.417,"Now, our engineers are working very hard to get your pump station fixed, and we're very sorry about it. We're gonna get your water flowing again."
00:40:44.292,00:40:47.458,But we need help. We need workers.
00:40:50.708,00:40:53.625,And we are going to be paying each man.
00:40:53.708,00:40:57.750,We're willing to pay him in cash for a ten-hour work day.
00:40:57.833,00:41:01.541,"Okay, move it along. This guy is next. Come through."
00:41:03.292,00:41:05.208,And we're gonna be here tomorrow at sunrise.
00:41:05.292,00:41:07.917,We're gonna transfer every willing worker to the pump station.
00:41:15.083,00:41:17.000,Help us help you.
00:41:19.625,00:41:20.666,Thank you.
00:41:21.917,00:41:23.958,"All right. Men over here, women over here."
00:41:24.041,00:41:26.333,That's how we do it in America. That's how we're gonna do it here.
00:41:26.416,00:41:28.625,Gimme more children. All the children up here.
00:41:32.375,00:41:34.583,Get the fuck back. I'm not gonna tell you again.
00:41:36.958,00:41:37.958,Hey.
00:41:38.875,00:41:42.125,"Hey, no, you weren't next! You weren't next. This guy's next."
00:41:42.208,00:41:44.916,"Join the line. Okay, you're good. Move on out."
00:41:45.000,00:41:47.541,"All of you guys... All right, fine."
00:41:47.625,00:41:50.250,"Okay, you're next. Thank you, sir."
00:41:50.333,00:41:52.292,Calm down. Keep it back. Keep it back.
00:41:52.375,00:41:54.833,"-Enzo, help out, will you? -Back it up. Back it up."
00:41:57.458,00:41:59.292,"Hey, easy. Get back."
00:42:06.042,00:42:08.625,"Please, keep back, sir. Back in the line."
00:42:12.583,00:42:13.583,Okay.
00:42:16.458,00:42:18.667,Okay. Let's go. Back them up.
00:42:20.000,00:42:22.833,"Okay, let this guy through. He's good."
00:42:23.750,00:42:27.583,You guys go around and join the line. Go around and join the line.
00:42:27.667,00:42:30.708,"I'm serving people who've been waiting first, okay?"
00:42:38.375,00:42:40.208,"Oh, yeah, that's good."
00:43:34.708,00:43:37.291,"Well, so much for our local labor."
00:43:41.708,00:43:44.708,I got a bull's-eye on me the longer we stay here.
00:43:44.791,00:43:46.541,Request we move this shit along.
00:43:48.666,00:43:50.083,"All right, we're not gonna wait any longer."
00:43:50.166,00:43:51.333,Let's go. Mount up.
00:43:52.708,00:43:54.292,"Machmoud, come on."
00:44:17.458,00:44:18.500,Ocre.
00:44:19.458,00:44:20.542,How we looking?
00:44:21.458,00:44:22.583,Like halfway.
00:44:23.166,00:44:25.541,"Harper, where are my Iraqis?"
00:44:26.792,00:44:31.083,"Uh, they didn't show, but... but I'm working on it."
00:44:31.166,00:44:33.250,"In fact, the captain and I have a meeting with the sheikh later."
00:44:33.875,00:44:35.583,What about you? Any progress?
00:44:37.458,00:44:38.875,Half the parts they don't make anymore.
00:44:40.000,00:44:41.500,"Shit sandwich, huh?"
00:44:42.417,00:44:44.875,We'll do our job. Just get me some labor.
00:45:05.791,00:45:08.625,"Sheikh's only ever talked to me, so I'll make the introduction."
00:45:08.708,00:45:11.041,Take your boots off when you get inside.
00:45:11.125,00:45:14.625,"Have some chai. And after chai, get down to business."
00:45:41.208,00:45:44.000,He... he don't like that you bring more soldiers to his home.
00:45:44.125,00:45:47.000,These soldiers are gonna give water to your people.
00:46:10.208,00:46:13.041,"We want the inclusion of your people, okay?"
00:46:13.125,00:46:16.083,We want them to work alongside us to help fix the problem that we caused.
00:46:22.916,00:46:26.166,"your people will help us, and get y'all's water working again."
00:46:38.541,00:46:41.166,"If he helps the Americans, he will pay with his life."
00:46:41.250,00:46:42.291,Him and his people.
00:46:42.375,00:46:44.417,"Yeah, we're gonna keep everybody protected, okay?"
00:46:44.500,00:46:49.041,"The captain and... and his men, they're gonna keep everybody safe."
00:47:01.083,00:47:02.958,He say Baqubah is two different cities.
00:47:03.041,00:47:07.333,"One during the day belongs to the US, and one at night belongs to other people."
00:47:13.833,00:47:16.375,"Uh, he say his people do not trust the Americans."
00:47:16.458,00:47:18.875,"When the night comes, you cannot protect."
00:47:19.958,00:47:21.083,Tell him...
00:47:22.958,00:47:25.041,I understand your fear. I do.
00:47:25.750,00:47:28.541,"But if we don't have help, there's not gonna be any water."
00:47:30.166,00:47:32.875,"No water. Tell him, Machmoud. No water."
00:47:49.333,00:47:54.458,Hello. Welcome. Hello. You deliver water?
00:47:55.042,00:47:57.375,"Uh, yeah, we'll be back tomorrow. Bring some containers."
00:47:57.458,00:48:00.500,"Oh, we have tanks in the school."
00:48:03.583,00:48:06.125,We don't need too much. But we need water.
00:48:07.542,00:48:08.958,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll see what I can do."
00:48:09.042,00:48:13.208,Thank you. I'm Kadeer. I'm the director of the school.
00:48:13.291,00:48:15.166,"Kadeer, I'm Matt. It's good to meet you."
00:48:15.250,00:48:17.291,"-Thank you. Thank you, sir. -Have a good day."
00:48:28.291,00:48:29.500,"We're gonna pay, okay?"
00:48:29.583,00:48:31.917,We have money. We will pay. Do you understand?
00:48:50.541,00:48:54.375,"Uh, the US come here and say they help. But when you leave, what will happen?"
00:48:55.375,00:48:59.500,Okay. Right. We... I want you to be real clear about this.
00:48:59.583,00:49:03.333,We will not leave. We will not leave until the problem is solved.
00:49:17.250,00:49:19.333,will not hurt us unless we help the Americans.
00:49:42.166,00:49:45.375,"Listen here, you piece of shit. I hope you get shot and fuckin' die."
00:49:50.333,00:49:51.750,"Thank you for your time, Sheikh."
00:50:05.500,00:50:06.708,You don't do this shit for free.
00:50:18.208,00:50:19.875,See how the soil won't clot?
00:50:21.125,00:50:22.958,No water means it can't form.
00:50:23.042,00:50:25.083,"If it can't form, it can't be fertile."
00:50:30.833,00:50:37.250,"Even before you guys came here, Sunni farmers in the north would steal the water from the Shiites in Baqubah."
00:50:37.333,00:50:39.333,How'd you stop it from happening?
00:50:42.208,00:50:43.292,It's the Sunnis and the Shiites.
00:50:43.375,00:50:45.750,They will always find an excuse to kill each other.
00:50:56.167,00:50:57.583,So it's definitely a thing.
00:51:10.541,00:51:11.833,We all carry it?
00:51:18.958,00:51:21.333,Keep moving! Keep moving! Keep moving!
00:51:23.791,00:51:25.958,Move through! Move through!
00:51:36.750,00:51:37.791,Damn it.
00:51:38.417,00:51:41.125,"Eagle Six, this is Eagle Four. We're FUBAR behind this goddamn truck!"
00:51:41.208,00:51:43.291,Everybody out! Dispatch!
00:51:54.333,00:51:57.250,Cease fire! Cease fire.
00:52:02.750,00:52:03.958,"Chutsky, H report."
00:52:04.042,00:52:07.833,"-I got two mags, .600 link. Up, up. -Roger that."
00:52:08.750,00:52:10.333,"Ocre, H report."
00:52:10.417,00:52:11.542,"Yeah, I'm two. Up, up."
00:52:23.333,00:52:24.500,-Yeah. -On me.
00:52:28.792,00:52:29.917,"Hey, Sergeant."
00:52:50.416,00:52:53.166,Fuckin' Iraqi in the truck. I told you we should've arrested him.
00:52:53.250,00:52:57.083,"Yeah, I'll be sure to put your complaint in my sitrep, okay, Sergeant? Thank you."
00:52:57.167,00:52:59.375,Fuck it. Fuck it.
00:53:04.125,00:53:06.375,Fuck it. I'm tired of this shit.
00:53:07.416,00:53:11.083,I don't give a fuck anymore. This is bullshit. I'm taking a shower.
00:53:14.291,00:53:15.333,-You in on this? -No. I'm good.
00:53:15.416,00:53:17.083,"All right, this is happening."
00:53:21.500,00:53:24.583,Let's go. Get back to your posts. You're good and clean.
00:53:24.667,00:53:26.375,"Sir, I need someone to loofah my back, sir."
00:53:55.000,00:53:58.625,This is bullshit. There's a whole village on the other side of that hill.
00:53:58.708,00:54:01.667,We're sitting here scabbing our hands like fuckin' chumps.
00:54:02.958,00:54:05.125,"Don't worry, assholes! We got it!"
00:54:06.875,00:54:08.083,They're just scared.
00:54:09.291,00:54:10.708,"What is that, some kinda fuckin' excuse?"
00:54:12.833,00:54:17.000,"-We're all fuckin' scared, Ocre. -Yeah, well, give it time."
00:54:19.041,00:54:23.250,You know what? You need to crawl out from behind your faggotty little rainbow.
00:54:23.875,00:54:27.667,"All right? We sit here all day, breaking our backs gettin' these fuckers water."
00:54:27.750,00:54:29.666,"And we turn around, they're fuckin' shooting at us."
00:54:30.625,00:54:32.458,I know a loaded deck when I see one.
00:54:44.833,00:54:46.250,Get to show his neck?
00:54:52.292,00:54:55.042,-Have a good day. Salaam. -Salaam.

00:55:06.791,00:55:10.166,-Jesus! Fuck! -Where's it coming from?
00:55:10.250,00:55:12.458,"Call it out! What do you see? Chutsky, gimme a report."

00:55:21.500,00:55:22.708,"All right, we're getting tagged from all sides."
00:55:22.792,00:55:24.583,"Burton, get up on the truck!"
00:55:27.500,00:55:29.792,We are in contact in the city square.
00:55:29.875,00:55:31.458,Do you copy? Warhorse?
00:55:32.875,00:55:34.375,"We got rooftop, twelve o'clock!"

00:56:32.208,00:56:34.166,-Keep his head down! -Yeah.
00:56:35.250,00:56:36.916,"Fuck! Chutsky, wait!"
00:56:40.041,00:56:41.083,Chutsky!
00:56:43.208,00:56:44.500,Chutsky!
00:56:47.166,00:56:48.875,"Hey! Hey, Chutsky, you okay?"
00:57:05.333,00:57:07.625,"Guys, Chutsky... Chutsky's down, guys!"
00:57:36.125,00:57:39.125,"You think, um... you think his family knows yet?"
00:57:51.958,00:57:53.791,I ain't running that dirt road again.
00:57:56.000,00:57:58.000,That thing is death on a fucking stick.
00:57:59.750,00:58:01.125,Tell me I'm wrong.
00:58:04.375,00:58:05.750,We're making progress.
00:58:10.792,00:58:11.792,"Tell him, Burton."
00:58:13.542,00:58:15.167,Tell him what you said to me.
00:58:17.000,00:58:18.125,Forget it.
00:58:18.208,00:58:19.500,Speak the fuck up and tell him what you said to me.
00:58:22.000,00:58:23.750,It's okay. Speak freely.
00:58:29.625,00:58:33.000,That we have a job to do and we'll do it.
00:58:34.083,00:58:37.458,"But if we stay on this course, we'll get picked off one by one."
00:58:40.625,00:58:42.458,before I'm folding your shit in a box.
00:58:43.583,00:58:45.750,Why don't we just go out and shoot 'em?
00:58:45.833,00:58:48.541,I wouldn't mind putting some bullets in those motherfuckers.
00:58:48.666,00:58:51.125,"Nope, guys. That's not our job, okay? That's not..."
00:58:51.208,00:58:52.666,We are here to help these people.
00:58:53.291,00:58:54.916,Those assholes don't want our help.
00:58:56.583,00:59:01.042,-Why the hell should we give it to 'em? -Yeah. The mission's a loser.
00:59:01.125,00:59:02.458,Even Machmoud knows it.
00:59:02.542,00:59:05.208,He said they were fighting over the water before we got here.
00:59:05.291,00:59:08.125,"If we put it back to normal, that's just what normal is."
00:59:08.208,00:59:09.791,"Okay, guys, you got tonight."
00:59:10.917,00:59:15.875,Okay? You get a whole fuckin' night to be sad or angry or whatever the fuck you need to secure your shit.
00:59:17.125,00:59:18.792,And tomorrow we're punching back in.
00:59:20.917,00:59:22.167,We're going back to work.
01:00:10.000,01:00:11.416,Mr. Matt!
01:00:20.708,01:00:23.250,"Mr. Matt, I'm sorry for what happened to your friend."
01:00:24.333,01:00:25.625,"Uh, why are you here?"
01:00:25.708,01:00:28.917,-You say you bring water to the school. -I said I'd try.
01:00:29.000,01:00:31.375,"That got fucked up yesterday though, didn't it?"
01:00:31.458,01:00:34.833,"Mr. Matt, with no water, the school will close."
01:00:34.916,01:00:36.208,There are people there.
01:00:36.291,01:00:38.833,"It's a community center, not only for children."
01:00:38.916,01:00:41.875,That's great. Just stop shooting at us.
01:00:41.958,01:00:44.666,We... we don't shoot. Not the people at the school.
01:00:44.750,01:00:47.208,We want the same thing as you do.
01:00:47.291,01:00:50.083,Really? What?
01:00:51.583,01:00:54.750,We want clean water. And for you to go home.
01:00:57.375,01:01:00.541,We've been trying. No one will help us.
01:01:00.625,01:01:02.500,Maybe you are asking the wrong people.
01:01:03.416,01:01:06.458,Mr. Matt! Mr. Matt!
01:01:21.458,01:01:24.542,I don't get it. You're gonna have to talk me through this.
01:01:27.333,01:01:31.125,"I've done this before. You talk to the guy in charge, and that's the sheikh."
01:01:31.208,01:01:34.583,And he's been very clear that the locals will not work with us.
01:01:34.666,01:01:37.750,"Well, that's exactly why we need somebody who's gonna do what the sheikh won't."
01:01:38.875,01:01:40.666,And you think a schoolteacher is the answer?
01:01:41.417,01:01:46.333,"All due respect, sir, we're down a tanker and we lost a man yesterday."
01:01:47.458,01:01:49.625,I gotta activate these guys.
01:01:49.708,01:01:51.333,Okay? And we can't do this on our own. I'm just...
01:01:51.416,01:01:53.208,I'm requesting you hear the private out.
01:01:54.000,01:01:55.000,Fine.
01:01:56.250,01:01:57.208,Private?
01:01:59.833,01:02:03.750,"Sir, I'm... I'm gonna be honest. I... I haven't really formulated a plan, but..."
01:02:05.375,01:02:06.958,"You know, nothing we've tried is working."
01:02:07.042,01:02:08.167,This man...
01:02:09.083,01:02:11.166,seems to have a legitimate reason to wanna work with us.
01:02:11.875,01:02:15.583,So maybe we could use that as an opportunity to reach out to the community.
01:02:15.666,01:02:17.291,What makes you think we can trust this guy?
01:02:19.000,01:02:24.750,"I think if Sergeant Harper and I go to the school, perhaps we can figure something out, sir."
01:02:27.125,01:02:28.833,Just don't fuck this up.
01:02:28.916,01:02:30.083,"Roger that, sir."
01:03:12.583,01:03:14.292,Is that all?
01:03:14.375,01:03:15.542,"Uh, yeah, yeah."
01:03:15.625,01:03:18.500,"Unfortunately, without the tanker, that's the best we can do."
01:03:18.583,01:03:19.667,I understand.
01:03:20.750,01:03:22.500,Thank you.
01:03:22.583,01:03:25.250,Very grateful. Thank you.
01:03:25.333,01:03:28.833,"Kadeer, um, you said we were talking to the wrong people."
01:03:28.917,01:03:32.042,"Could you explain to the people here what we're doing, why we're here?"
01:03:33.125,01:03:35.375,"-They know. -Yeah, but they won't help."
01:03:39.083,01:03:41.041,Working with the Americans is very dangerous.
01:03:41.125,01:03:43.125,How can you guarantee their safety?
01:03:46.083,01:03:47.458,Everything goes through you.
01:03:47.542,01:03:50.542,You talk to them. You bring them to the pumping station.
01:03:50.625,01:03:51.792,Nobody has to know.
01:03:56.208,01:03:58.125,"Look, it's your terms, okay?"
01:03:58.208,01:04:00.833,"You bring us the workers, we give the water at the pumping station."
01:04:00.916,01:04:03.500,"And look, we're gonna pay them in cash. And you."
01:04:03.583,01:04:06.125,"Uh, I don't need the money. The money is for the school."
01:04:10.875,01:04:12.958,I will try. I will speak with them.
01:04:22.250,01:04:23.750,"Hey, Machmoud."
01:04:49.083,01:04:50.833,Looks like your hajjis are here.
01:04:50.917,01:04:53.458,"Could you come down and verify, please? Over."
01:04:53.542,01:04:54.833,"Yeah, we'll be right down."
01:04:54.916,01:04:56.708,You wanted workers? You got workers.
01:05:11.875,01:05:13.417,"Hey, hey. Step away from the bag."
01:05:13.500,01:05:15.875,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down."
01:05:22.542,01:05:25.583,I need everybody to calm... I need everybody quiet.
01:05:27.833,01:05:29.958,There's precision tools in there. I don't like the looks of it.
01:05:30.042,01:05:33.458,"Kadeer. Kadeer, please tell... This is your brother?"
01:05:33.542,01:05:36.083,"Yes, Mr. Harper. My brother is an engineer."
01:05:36.167,01:05:38.500,Here... here he... He is here to help you.
01:05:38.583,01:05:43.083,"Okay. Uh, we're gonna need your brother to show my private the contents of that bag."
01:05:47.542,01:05:49.083,-I'm sorry. It's procedure. -Please.
01:05:49.167,01:05:50.333,-There's no disrespect. -Please.
01:05:53.083,01:05:55.167,Okay. Okay. Perfect.
01:05:55.250,01:05:56.250,Perfect.
01:05:57.167,01:05:58.667,Yeah. Can you move this?
01:05:58.750,01:05:59.750,Move this.
01:06:04.125,01:06:05.708,"All right, everybody... everybody, calm down."
01:06:05.792,01:06:07.875,-Thank you. -Please put the bag on the ground.
01:06:07.958,01:06:10.333,"Machmoud, tell him to get to the back of the line."
01:06:12.500,01:06:13.875,"Corporal, I want you to start patting guys down."
01:06:13.958,01:06:15.000,"-Ocre, help Corporal. -Yep."
01:06:15.083,01:06:17.708,"Private, I want you to search that car right now. Thoroughly. Thank you."
01:06:17.792,01:06:19.167,Please step up right here.
01:06:19.250,01:06:20.250,"Machmoud, come on."
01:07:20.417,01:07:22.250,I know that. Can he fix it?
01:07:38.333,01:07:39.625,Great. Have at it.
01:07:42.167,01:07:44.958,"So you, um... you speak English too?"
01:07:45.042,01:07:46.417,Yes.
01:07:46.500,01:07:48.458,How... how'd you learn all that stuff?
01:07:49.833,01:07:53.208,"Here, in University of Mosul."
01:07:53.292,01:07:54.958,-Ah. -Mechanical engineering.
01:07:59.042,01:08:00.917,You go to university?
01:08:01.000,01:08:03.000,"No. No, no, no, it was too expensive."
01:08:03.500,01:08:06.250,You have to pay to study? It's not free?
01:08:06.333,01:08:07.583,Yeah.
01:08:07.667,01:08:09.667,"-What, it's free here? -Of course."
01:08:10.667,01:08:13.125,"Shit. Well, in America nothing's free."
01:08:35.958,01:08:37.375,"Hey, baby."
01:08:41.042,01:08:43.833,"Here, man. Spray her for me."
01:08:45.666,01:08:50.125,"Huh. Okay. Hey, why do you paint her green?"
01:08:50.792,01:08:54.875,"Strays around here, wild and pissed off. People shoot 'em on sight."
01:08:56.375,01:08:58.750,"Green dog, that's a good dog."
01:08:58.833,01:09:01.875,"Anyone shoots a green dog, they answer to me."
01:09:04.500,01:09:05.625,Any tips?
01:09:07.000,01:09:08.750,"Yeah, just don't get it in her eyes."
01:09:10.292,01:09:12.667,"-Hey, you said her name's Aika? -Aika."
01:09:12.750,01:09:13.792,"Hey, Aika."
01:09:14.792,01:09:15.792,Hey.
01:09:51.208,01:09:53.458,Robinson said we should be done in a week.
01:09:56.000,01:09:58.208,Yup. Can't come soon enough.
01:10:00.958,01:10:02.667,All I'm looking forward to...
01:10:03.583,01:10:06.375,is getting back home to the Frisky Kitty Buffet.
01:10:10.583,01:10:11.667,Who you wanna see?
01:10:11.750,01:10:13.125,"-Mercedes. -Mercedes, baby."
01:10:13.208,01:10:15.333,"You know why. 'Cause how we like 'em, Burton?"
01:10:21.917,01:10:23.125,What are you eating?
01:10:25.500,01:10:30.125,"MRE. This is, uh... penne and vegetable."
01:10:30.708,01:10:32.917,"-It's good? -Yeah, you want some?"
01:10:34.042,01:10:36.208,No. You try chicken pilaf?
01:10:36.292,01:10:38.792,"-Yeah, man. -Chicken and rice."
01:10:38.875,01:10:40.667,"-Do you want it? -No, no."
01:10:40.750,01:10:42.000,-Try some chicken. -Okay.
01:10:42.083,01:10:43.458,"Here, taste."
01:10:44.583,01:10:45.708,"My wife, she made this."
01:10:47.083,01:10:48.500,"-Uh-uh, Sarge. -It's not chicken."
01:10:48.583,01:10:51.125,-Don't do it. -How many chickens do you see out here?
01:10:51.208,01:10:52.792,"-Here, you try it first. -I'm good. I'm full."
01:10:52.875,01:10:54.792,I got lasagna and... Oof!
01:11:06.375,01:11:07.542,My compliments to your wife.
01:11:07.625,01:11:08.750,-Thank you. -Thank you.
01:11:09.875,01:11:10.958,"Nah, I'm joking."
01:11:16.583,01:11:18.042,You sure you don't want some of my penne?
01:11:18.125,01:11:20.750,"No, really, it's... No."
01:11:21.666,01:11:22.708,Smart man.
01:11:50.791,01:11:52.583,"-I wanna be serious, all right? -Say it."
01:11:52.667,01:11:54.333,This is for...
01:11:54.417,01:11:56.292,"This is for fuckin'... This is for fuckin' Chutsky, man."
01:11:56.375,01:11:57.750,"-Chutsky, baby. -Chutsky."
01:12:27.958,01:12:30.208,"Okay, where the fuck is Kadeer and these guys?"
01:13:25.667,01:13:27.583,"Machmoud, come here."
01:13:58.750,01:14:01.667,"You're gonna have to get higher on the horn, okay? Out. Copy."
01:15:04.667,01:15:07.667,The downtown market here is where they are based.
01:15:07.750,01:15:08.958,They meet at night.
01:15:10.042,01:15:14.375,The flower shop here... is where I think they hide their weapons.
01:15:14.458,01:15:18.875,I know the place. Thank you. And we're sorry for your loss.
01:15:20.375,01:15:21.875,I don't need your thanks.
01:15:24.917,01:15:28.542,"BJ, would you, uh, escort this gentleman out, please?"
01:15:31.000,01:15:32.458,"Harper, Ocre."
01:15:38.791,01:15:40.916,Do you guys think this info is credible?
01:15:41.708,01:15:43.958,Should see what they did to this guy's brother.
01:15:45.375,01:15:47.125,He's got every reason to want to help us.
01:15:49.500,01:15:50.500,Pepps?
01:15:54.875,01:15:59.625,"Okay. Well, this intel's only gonna last so long before it goes bad, so we got to move."
01:15:59.708,01:16:02.792,"My guess, we can take two teams. I'll lead Alpha on the back."
01:16:02.875,01:16:04.917,"I'll take Bravo and make entry, hold the front."
01:16:05.708,01:16:09.458,"I can get the guys in there, but we don't have enough vehicles to block the street, so..."
01:16:10.083,01:16:13.166,"-we're gonna be needin' your help. -Yeah, roger that."
01:16:14.625,01:16:17.208,Good. Full brief in about an hour.
01:16:27.000,01:16:30.167,"Anne, I... Look, will you just... will you say it?"
01:16:35.708,01:16:37.208,"Will you just say it even if you don't mean it, Anne?"
01:16:37.292,01:16:38.333,Just say it.
01:16:38.417,01:16:39.542,"No, never mind."
01:16:40.750,01:16:41.792,"Okay, Anne."
01:16:46.666,01:16:48.458,"Hey, phone's free if you want."
01:17:03.750,01:17:05.625,Yup. Yeah. Yup.
01:17:12.333,01:17:15.333,"Hey, bro, you know, we're finally gonna get a chance to get these guys."
01:17:17.583,01:17:22.833,"Then we can finish the pump station, fix it, go home."
01:17:29.166,01:17:31.666,There's a bullet out there for everyone...
01:17:33.750,01:17:36.458,with their names written small on the side.
01:17:43.333,01:17:45.042,"No, my dad used to say that."
01:17:46.917,01:17:48.083,That's comforting.
01:17:49.333,01:17:51.292,"But it is, if you think about it."
01:17:53.083,01:17:55.333,"You know, maybe... maybe my bullet's waiting out there."
01:17:56.375,01:17:59.375,Or maybe my bullet is cancer. Gonna hit me 50 years from now.
01:18:00.292,01:18:02.042,"Oh, but that's not up to me."
01:18:02.958,01:18:04.125,So why worry?
01:18:17.750,01:18:19.167,"Sure you're up for this, huh?"
01:18:20.666,01:18:21.875,Yeah.
01:19:10.291,01:19:11.666,"This is war, baby."
01:19:14.833,01:19:17.250,"I'm just fuckin' scared, man. My hands shaking and shit, like..."
01:19:17.333,01:19:20.583,-Now look at me. Look at me. -...a little bitch.
01:19:20.667,01:19:22.458,Now you drive this motherfucker.
01:19:23.375,01:19:25.292,And I shoot anything that gets in the way.
01:19:27.000,01:19:28.292,You understand me?
01:19:31.167,01:19:33.000,You keep me safe up there.
01:19:51.875,01:19:52.958,"Hey, James."
01:19:57.500,01:19:58.917,Your boys good?
01:21:20.125,01:21:21.875,"Hey, Ocre, I want you on twelve and three."
01:21:21.958,01:21:22.958,Roger.
01:21:45.167,01:21:47.917,"Eagle Six, this is Eagle Four. Blocking position three is set."
01:21:48.833,01:21:51.041,"Roger that, Eagle Four. All positions are set."
01:22:12.875,01:22:16.166,"-What you got up there, brother? -Yeah, I got your fuckin' mom up here."
01:23:43.166,01:23:44.208,Contact! Copy?
01:24:23.125,01:24:24.125,Clear!

01:24:36.958,01:24:38.208,Fuck! Shit!
01:24:38.291,01:24:41.958,"Eagle Six, this is blocking position three! Under fire!"
01:24:43.000,01:24:44.250,Shit!
01:24:44.333,01:24:46.375,Contact! Six o'clock!
01:24:46.458,01:24:47.833,"Roger, six o'clock!"
01:24:52.458,01:24:55.791,-Where? -First-floor porch! 30 meters!
01:24:58.167,01:24:59.167,Fucker.
01:25:03.125,01:25:04.250,Shit!
01:25:07.208,01:25:08.375,Fuck.
01:25:09.583,01:25:12.250,"Ah, fuck! Ah, shit! Shit! Fuck!"
01:25:12.333,01:25:14.708,"-Are you good? -No, man! The son of a bitch shot me!"
01:25:14.791,01:25:16.166,Where are you fuckin' hit? Where are you hit?
01:25:16.250,01:25:18.041,"I'm hit in the shoulder, man. This shit fuckin' burns."
01:25:18.125,01:25:19.666,Enzo's fuckin' hit!

01:31:57.750,01:32:02.791,"Well... a rough night, but it was not for nothing."
01:32:33.291,01:32:34.333,Salaam.
01:34:07.667,01:34:10.417,"Arif, your wife make the, uh, tagine?"

01:34:43.292,01:34:44.458,All right.
01:35:16.583,01:35:17.416,Huh?
01:35:35.125,01:35:36.958,There are multiple casualties.
01:35:37.042,01:35:40.458,Requesting immediate medevac and immediate reinforcements.
01:35:40.542,01:35:42.500,Say again. This is Eagle Six.
01:35:42.583,01:35:48.208,"We have suffered an IED attack at the pump station, northeast."
01:35:48.292,01:35:50.333,We're requesting immediate...
01:35:50.458,01:35:51.583,Ocre!
01:35:53.667,01:35:55.417,"You all right, man? Yeah?"
01:35:56.333,01:35:58.208,"Yeah? Go sit down, man."
01:36:05.875,01:36:09.292,Line one. Papa-Yankee- five-four-three-niner.
01:36:10.458,01:36:13.125,Four-five-niner-one.
01:36:29.250,01:36:30.500,It can be beautiful.
01:36:31.750,01:36:32.750,Can't it?
01:38:16.666,01:38:17.791,Attention.
01:38:23.250,01:38:24.333,At ease.
01:38:41.416,01:38:42.750,Sergeant Harper...
01:38:43.541,01:38:46.541,Three weeks' leave to return with us in Riyadh.
01:38:47.125,01:38:48.166,"Roger, sir."
01:38:50.375,01:38:51.458,Private Ocre.
01:38:53.666,01:38:55.708,What do you say we get you back on level ground?
01:38:57.791,01:39:00.333,There's a convoy leaving at 1400.
01:39:01.000,01:39:05.042,It'll take you to the Balad flightline and a C-130 will take you back to the States.
01:39:08.708,01:39:12.125,"I'm happy to waive my leave, sir. If it's all the same, I'll stay."
01:39:12.208,01:39:15.375,"The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son."
01:39:17.125,01:39:18.500,"You're going home, Private."
01:39:21.167,01:39:24.333,"Sergeant Major, there is no reason to be concerned about-- Your war is over."
01:39:28.000,01:39:29.917,-The war isn't over-- -Excuse me?
01:39:31.542,01:39:35.750,"With all due respect, what happened in Baqubah-- Permission to speak freely, sir?"
01:39:35.833,01:39:37.208,Yeah.
01:39:37.292,01:39:41.750,"As the NCO in charge of Private Ocre, it is my opinion that he has nothing more to prove to himself or to anybody else."
01:39:41.833,01:39:44.916,-It's not about proving anything-- -Ocre. Ocre.
01:39:46.958,01:39:48.541,"-It's time to go home, Matt. -No."
01:39:48.625,01:39:51.625,"-This is the time when we are-- -Take it easy there, son."
01:39:52.542,01:39:57.167,"Sergeant Major, I think we need to talk about what happened, and then maybe we can fix it."
01:39:57.250,01:39:59.333,Your job is done here!
01:39:59.958,01:40:00.958,How?
01:40:02.917,01:40:07.958,"No, please, someone tell me how my fuckin' job is done here, -because I don't see how it's-- -God damn it, Private!"
01:40:09.667,01:40:10.958,You're dismissed.
01:40:46.500,01:40:49.125,"They, uh, made me see the chaplain."
01:40:49.208,01:40:50.292,Ooh.
01:40:52.958,01:40:53.958,What'd he say?
01:40:55.583,01:40:56.917,"It's, uh, God's plan."
01:40:59.042,01:41:02.375,Then he asked if I smoke. I said no.
01:41:02.458,01:41:05.833,"So, uh, he gives me these and said maybe I should consider starting."
01:41:07.333,01:41:09.125,How about you? What you thinking about?
01:41:14.666,01:41:16.500,What am I thinking about? Uh...
01:41:19.792,01:41:21.750,I'm thinking about a Royals game.
01:41:23.458,01:41:24.917,A Royals game...
01:41:26.125,01:41:27.250,a Tecate...
01:41:28.333,01:41:29.708,and garlic fries.
01:41:30.333,01:41:33.375,"-Ooh, garlic fries. -Yup."
01:41:36.417,01:41:39.542,"I start thinking about that, and all this other shit starts rushing back, you know?"
01:41:40.916,01:41:42.958,I haven't even thought about home for a long time.
01:41:49.208,01:41:52.083,Did I tell you some captain told me to blouse my boots today?
01:41:52.167,01:41:53.750,Can you believe that shit?
01:41:53.833,01:41:58.541,"Some dude fresh off the boat, hasn't done a damn thing, tells me to blouse my boots and look professional."
01:41:59.375,01:42:02.625,"I was fucking pissed, not just 'cause of the boot thing, but..."
01:42:02.708,01:42:03.708,But what?
01:42:06.208,01:42:08.458,"You know, we fucking had it, Sergeant."
01:42:08.542,01:42:10.542,The people were with us. The water was gonna flow.
01:42:10.625,01:42:12.292,"It wasn't ours to have, Ocre."
01:42:14.125,01:42:19.125,"-You got nothing to feel guilty about. -No, but-- Okay? For whatever you did or whatever you didn't do."
01:42:19.208,01:42:20.208,"No, I..."
01:42:22.458,01:42:25.541,I broke my own hand back in Kuwait. I slammed it in a Hummer door.
01:42:26.458,01:42:29.125,Just... trying to get out of all this shit.
01:42:37.500,01:42:38.667,"Well, now you can."
01:42:51.833,01:42:53.083,"Hey, you want these?"
01:42:54.542,01:42:55.542,Nope.
01:43:49.792,01:43:51.542,"Confusing feeling, ain't it?"
01:43:52.791,01:43:55.125,All we do is think about going home...
01:43:56.875,01:43:58.416,"Now, here it is."
01:43:59.750,01:44:01.750,"I don't feel anything, Sergeant Major."
01:44:02.291,01:44:04.625,"Yeah, it takes a while before it kicks in."
01:44:05.417,01:44:07.708,But it'll catch up. Believe me.
01:44:17.000,01:44:18.166,"Hey, Sergeant Major?"
01:44:21.208,01:44:23.083,Beautiful day for the infantry?
01:44:25.541,01:44:26.708,"Beautiful day, son."
01:44:29.583,01:44:31.541,Beautiful goddamn day.
01:44:36.875,01:44:37.916,All right.
01:44:39.958,01:44:42.000,Better get a move on. Gonna miss your flight.
01:44:43.583,01:44:44.416,Yeah.
01:44:48.375,01:44:50.291,I'll see ya on the other side of the berm.
01:44:51.208,01:44:52.708,I'll see you on the other side.
