00:00:54.387,00:00:59.325,Why did some people do something and others nothing at all?
00:00:59.726,00:01:02.328,"Good job, Mr. Bowden."
00:01:02.462,00:01:07.133,"It's nice to see a few more A's. Including Mr. Bowden's, of course."
00:01:12.105,00:01:15.475,This concludes our week on the Holocaust.
00:01:20.680,00:01:23.783,"If you want to know more, you may find the Santo Donato Library..."
00:01:24.117,00:01:26.352,...to be an excellent resource.
00:05:37.603,00:05:39.572,-Guess who likes you? -Who?
00:05:41.007,00:05:42.709,Becky Trask. You gonna ask her out?
00:05:42.842,00:05:46.512,-You know who I'm talking about? -I know who she is.
00:05:46.646,00:05:49.649,"-I'll think about it. -No, you don't think. You just do it."
00:05:49.782,00:05:51.050,All right?
00:05:51.384,00:05:54.620,And could you give me your trig notes from last year?
00:05:54.754,00:05:58.091,-I knew this was leading to something. -I've got Fiscarelli.
00:05:58.458,00:06:01.427,-I'll bring them in tomorrow. -All right? Cool. Ask Becky out.
00:06:01.561,00:06:02.895,I still gotta think about it.
00:06:03.029,00:06:06.566,-What are you doing after school? -I'm busy.
00:07:43.529,00:07:46.499,"All right, I'm coming."
00:07:48.568,00:07:50.570,For God's sake.
00:07:56.909,00:07:58.778,Yes?
00:08:02.482,00:08:03.749,What do you want?
00:08:04.050,00:08:05.518,I....
00:08:07.653,00:08:09.755,If you're selling something I'm not interested.
00:08:09.889,00:08:12.124,I have your newspaper.
00:08:16.496,00:08:18.798,I'm not selling anything.
00:08:19.098,00:08:21.033,Then what do you want?
00:08:21.167,00:08:23.903,"If you could let me in for a minute, I just want to talk."
00:08:24.637,00:08:26.572,Talk?
00:08:27.139,00:08:30.676,I don't have anything to say to you. Good day.
00:08:30.810,00:08:34.714,"Bergen-Belsen, January '43-June '43."
00:08:35.181,00:08:38.985,"Auschwitz, June '43-June '44."
00:08:39.151,00:08:41.220,Then you went to Patin.
00:08:41.888,00:08:44.023,"After that, you disappeared."
00:08:44.590,00:08:47.894,But then in 1965 you were spotted in West Berlin.
00:08:49.529,00:08:51.731,"Listen, boy..."
00:08:53.165,00:08:55.935,...I don't have time for this game.
00:08:56.168,00:08:58.971,Now get out of here before I call the police.
00:08:59.105,00:09:02.775,Call them if you want. I'm sure they'd love to meet you.
00:09:06.078,00:09:07.947,Who are you?
00:09:08.714,00:09:12.151,My name is Todd Bowden. I didn't mean to scare you.
00:09:12.285,00:09:14.253,I just really want to talk to you.
00:09:14.887,00:09:17.290,If you could let me in for a minute?
00:09:17.623,00:09:21.227,"Please, Mr. Dussander."
00:09:24.564,00:09:29.335,All of this because you saw an old man with a raincoat and an umbrella?
00:09:29.669,00:09:30.903,It wasn't that easy.
00:09:31.037,00:09:33.239,These pictures are 40 years old at least.
00:09:33.839,00:09:36.943,"But when I held them up next to the ones I took, I knew I was close."
00:09:37.743,00:09:43.583,"-You took photographs of me? -Yeah, but even then I wasn't sure."
00:09:43.716,00:09:45.885,I needed real proof.
00:09:46.018,00:09:48.120,So I dusted your mail box for fingerprints.
00:09:49.021,00:09:51.324,"You know, that's a lot harder than people think."
00:09:51.657,00:09:54.927,You need a lot of stuff.
00:09:55.061,00:09:57.029,Then I waited until you were at the movies.
00:09:57.163,00:10:00.933,You put dust on my mail box for fingerprints?
00:10:01.067,00:10:04.670,You took photographs of me. What else did you do?
00:10:05.371,00:10:09.709,I already had a copy of your fingerprints from your Israeli wanted sheet.
00:10:09.842,00:10:11.677,It's all on database at UC Irvine.
00:10:15.915,00:10:17.750,Are you okay?
00:10:20.786,00:10:23.956,"-Would you care for a drink, boy? -How about milk?"
00:10:24.090,00:10:25.625,Milk?
00:10:35.401,00:10:38.771,Have you told your parents all this?
00:10:38.904,00:10:41.140,Do you think I'm crazy?
00:10:42.642,00:10:46.646,It takes eight good matches for a print to get accepted in court.
00:10:46.779,00:10:48.114,They're called compares.
00:10:48.247,00:10:52.418,"One or two is not so hard to find, but eight good ones, that's really tough."
00:10:52.752,00:10:55.788,"It all sounds very exciting, boy..."
00:10:56.122,00:10:59.992,...but I'm afraid all your work has been for nothing.
00:11:00.126,00:11:01.761,I found 14 compares.
00:11:06.932,00:11:09.435,"Boy, what you have done..."
00:11:09.769,00:11:13.839,...I have to explain this to you because clearly you don't understand.
00:11:13.973,00:11:16.675,What you have done is a violation.
00:11:16.809,00:11:19.211,Like those experiments with the decompression chamber?
00:11:19.345,00:11:21.447,Now that's a violation.
00:11:21.781,00:11:24.750,To hell with this and to hell with you. I'm calling the police.
00:11:24.884,00:11:28.687,Your father's going to beat your behind when he picks you up.
00:11:28.821,00:11:32.091,-He doesn't believe in violence. -They should start. I'm calling.
00:11:43.302,00:11:45.371,My name is Denker.
00:11:49.408,00:11:51.377,Arthur Denker.
00:11:54.146,00:11:55.714,I'm an American.
00:11:57.083,00:12:00.252,I became a citizen in 1955.
00:12:04.056,00:12:05.891,I vote.
00:12:08.761,00:12:14.433,You've no right to come here and say these lies about me.
00:12:16.969,00:12:18.971,I have your fingerprints.
00:12:19.939,00:12:22.174,I have your photographs.
00:12:22.308,00:12:25.244,"One way or another, I'll get them to the right people."
00:12:32.818,00:12:35.154,This is unbelievable.
00:12:40.493,00:12:43.362,What do you want? Tell me.
00:12:46.165,00:12:47.766,I want to hear about it.
00:12:48.767,00:12:49.902,Hear about what?
00:12:50.035,00:12:53.906,The stories. Everything.
00:12:55.007,00:12:56.775,What everything?
00:12:57.776,00:13:01.113,Everything they're afraid to show us in school.
00:13:02.314,00:13:06.152,You were there. You did those things.
00:13:06.318,00:13:11.457,No one can tell it better than you. That's all I want.
00:13:11.790,00:13:16.462,Then I'll leave you alone. And just so you know....
00:13:19.465,00:13:22.268,Everything I have on you...
00:13:22.401,00:13:26.572,"...the compares, the want sheet, all the photographs..."
00:13:26.906,00:13:28.874,...are all in a very safe place.
00:13:29.008,00:13:32.211,"If anything happens to me, someone will find it, believe me."
00:13:35.514,00:13:40.386,"Tell me, boy, why should I consider doing this?"
00:13:41.120,00:13:43.489,"Because you hung up the phone, that's why."
00:14:07.046,00:14:10.382,Judging by the results of your first exam...
00:14:10.516,00:14:15.154,"...for most of you, we moved too fast through chapter one."
00:14:16.288,00:14:22.394,"By a show of hands, how many of you think you know what sociology is?"
00:14:26.031,00:14:31.303,"As I thought. All right, class, let's turn to chapter two."
00:14:39.144,00:14:43.349,"Once they were in the chamber, how long did it take? A minute? Five?"
00:14:44.383,00:14:49.255,"No, the Prussic acid took about 15 minutes."
00:14:49.388,00:14:55.160,"But the monoxide could take an hour, sometimes more."
00:14:55.961,00:14:59.431,"What happened to them? I mean, exactly?"
00:15:03.535,00:15:05.504,It was a mess.
00:15:06.305,00:15:08.607,They would lose control of their bodies.
00:15:08.941,00:15:14.213,"They vomited, urinated and defecated themselves."
00:15:14.346,00:15:18.684,Even though the gas came through vents in the ceiling...
00:15:19.051,00:15:21.553,...they climbed up on each other...
00:15:21.921,00:15:25.925,...desperately reaching for fresh air that wasn't there.
00:15:27.026,00:15:30.663,There died in a mountain of themselves.
00:15:31.263,00:15:33.332,What about the children?
00:15:35.668,00:15:37.503,On the bottom.
00:15:40.940,00:15:43.142,Did anyone ever survive it?
00:15:48.614,00:15:50.516,One time...
00:15:52.351,00:15:55.020,...the gas didn't work.
00:15:56.188,00:16:02.494,"There was a leak in the pipes, so oxygen mixed with the monoxide."
00:16:03.395,00:16:05.130,It was horrible.
00:16:05.965,00:16:09.368,"But after an hour, they were still moving."
00:16:09.969,00:16:15.240,"Stumbling around the room like drunks, their eyes glassy."
00:16:16.675,00:16:18.110,What did you do?
00:16:19.511,00:16:23.315,"I ordered more gas, but we didn't know about the leak."
00:16:23.716,00:16:27.252,Soon they began to twitch all over...
00:16:27.553,00:16:29.555,...like they were dancing.
00:16:30.055,00:16:31.991,Some even fell to their knees...
00:16:32.124,00:16:36.528,...laughing this terrible high-pitched scream.
00:16:37.563,00:16:40.566,Even the guards were frightened.
00:16:44.136,00:16:46.138,It didn't kill them.
00:16:46.672,00:16:51.043,"After two hours, I sent five men in with rifles."
00:16:56.382,00:16:59.151,It's getting dark. Your mother will be worried.
00:17:01.020,00:17:02.554,Shit! I've got to go.
00:17:02.688,00:17:05.791,I can be here tomorrow by 3:15. I wanna hear the end of this.
00:17:06.125,00:17:07.693,The end?
00:17:12.131,00:17:14.066,The end.
00:18:11.690,00:18:14.159,"Todd, are you up?"
00:18:14.293,00:18:16.495,"Honey, let's go. Joey's outside."
00:18:17.229,00:18:18.764,"Tell him I'm coming, will you?"
00:18:19.098,00:18:21.233,I thought you said you were up half an hour ago.
00:18:23.869,00:18:27.806,-Todd? -Yeah. I must have fallen back asleep.
00:18:28.140,00:18:30.776,"Listen, honey, I'm gonna see a client tonight at 7:00."
00:18:31.110,00:18:33.846,But I've got some cold chicken in the fridge.
00:18:34.179,00:18:36.648,It's okay. I'm gonna eat over at Mr. Denker's house.
00:18:38.117,00:18:40.652,"And do what, watch TV?"
00:18:40.786,00:18:45.691,I told you. He doesn't watch TV. I read books to him. Don't worry about it.
00:18:45.824,00:18:50.662,Listen to me now. Invite him over here. Daddy and I still want to meet him.
00:18:51.530,00:18:53.132,Okay?
00:18:53.799,00:18:58.837,"The policeman said: Mr. Denker, if you can't see the road..."
00:18:59.171,00:19:01.240,...you shouldn't be driving.
00:19:01.373,00:19:04.243,How many fingers am I holding up?
00:19:04.376,00:19:08.747,"I said, Well now, officer, let me guess."
00:19:09.581,00:19:11.316,One?
00:19:14.153,00:19:19.625,That was the end of my driving in America. I take the bus.
00:19:20.359,00:19:23.395,"Of course, I'm not driving much either with this wheelchair..."
00:19:23.529,00:19:26.765,...but my sight is not what it used to be.
00:19:29.434,00:19:31.303,That's a white-tailed buck.
00:19:33.472,00:19:35.707,It's a remnant from our life in Carolina.
00:19:35.841,00:19:39.611,Dick brought that down in Yadkin River seven years ago.
00:19:39.745,00:19:40.779,Seven.
00:19:40.913,00:19:44.650,Your grandson never told me he came from a family of hunters.
00:19:44.850,00:19:49.588,"-Todd never took a shine to guns. -No, he's good at other things."
00:19:49.721,00:19:51.523,Baseball is Todd's game.
00:19:51.657,00:19:54.193,"Arthur, you sure I can't interest you in a cigar?"
00:19:54.326,00:19:57.329,"No, thank you. If you don't mind, I'll have one of my cigarettes."
00:19:57.462,00:19:58.730,Where are they?
00:19:59.765,00:20:03.735,"-Let me help you with that, Arthur. -My dear..."
00:20:03.869,00:20:06.738,...your generosity humbles me.
00:20:06.872,00:20:10.842,Thank you for the most enchanting evening.
00:20:15.347,00:20:19.218,"Arthur, I wonder if you'd mind if I ask you a personal question."
00:20:19.351,00:20:20.719,Not at all.
00:20:21.787,00:20:23.755,What did you do during the war?
00:20:29.494,00:20:33.498,"I was in the reserves, as were most young men, Victor."
00:20:33.632,00:20:37.803,"But my poor eyesight kept me out of combat, thank God."
00:20:38.370,00:20:41.640,I spent most of the war in the military hospital...
00:20:41.773,00:20:45.244,...washing bed linens and nurses' uniforms.
00:20:49.648,00:20:51.950,"You're been pretty quiet tonight, pal."
00:20:52.284,00:20:56.622,"I'm sorry, it's just that I've heard all these stories before."
00:20:56.755,00:20:58.790,"-Todd! -Oh, that's quite all right, my dear."
00:20:58.924,00:21:02.394,The boy's just being honest. It's a privilege of boys.
00:21:03.795,00:21:08.634,A privilege that men must sometimes give up.
00:21:11.403,00:21:14.640,That reminds me....
00:21:14.773,00:21:18.343,It must have been my first year at the university...
00:21:18.477,00:21:22.014,"...there was a group of about three or four of us, and...."
00:21:22.447,00:21:27.619,"At first my men took turns shooting them, but there were so many."
00:21:27.753,00:21:30.989,Two or three bodies could be packed into each oven.
00:21:31.323,00:21:34.793,They were ground into fine ash.
00:21:34.926,00:21:39.765,A whole town was wiped off the face of the earth.
00:21:52.844,00:21:55.847,And still it wasn't enough for Himmler.
00:21:55.981,00:21:57.616,It was a dark year.
00:21:57.749,00:22:02.821,He ordered every Jew in Kiev to come to the Babi Jar ravine.
00:22:02.988,00:22:07.959,"Remember, the '20s were a desperate time in Germany."
00:22:08.093,00:22:11.697,The Treaty of Versailles had left us crippled.
00:22:12.631,00:22:16.702,They would hide in the walls.
00:22:16.868,00:22:22.007,"We always found them. If the dogs didn't, smoke and fire would."
00:22:22.341,00:22:26.578,We would round them up and march them out to a large pit.
00:22:26.712,00:22:30.615,"At the time, the shooting was no longer killing. Nothing would stop us."
00:22:30.749,00:22:33.351,Killing was no longer death.
00:22:34.352,00:22:37.723,I will never forget the sound that night.
00:22:38.857,00:22:42.627,So many of them on top of each other like that.
00:22:42.761,00:22:47.099,"After a few hours, they began to settle."
00:22:51.136,00:22:53.905,A head would fall.
00:22:55.040,00:22:57.476,An arm would drop.
00:23:02.080,00:23:06.651,It was a bit like the sound of blowing leaves.
00:23:09.454,00:23:11.523,What did it feel like?
00:23:25.704,00:23:28.540,It's just something that had to be done.
00:23:28.673,00:23:34.412,A door had been opened and couldn't be shut. It was the end....
00:23:35.113,00:23:37.716,You don't understand.
00:23:39.718,00:23:42.687,You've done it a million times. Let's go! Let's go!
00:24:03.642,00:24:06.578,"All right, that's it. Hit the shower."
00:24:07.979,00:24:10.916,-Where have you been? -What do you mean?
00:24:11.049,00:24:12.984,"Well, if you'd return your phone calls..."
00:24:13.118,00:24:16.755,...you'd know that Damon's having a party on Saturday night.
00:24:16.888,00:24:18.456,I've been busy.
00:24:19.558,00:24:21.626,Too busy for your best friend?
00:24:21.760,00:24:25.130,"Look, I've been studying a lot, okay? I'm sorry."
00:24:25.797,00:24:27.899,Are you going to go?
00:24:28.600,00:24:30.969,I don't even know if I can get the car or not.
00:24:31.102,00:24:34.973,-I know someone who'll give you a ride. -Who?
00:24:37.175,00:24:40.145,"-I don't get it. -Well, did you talk to her?"
00:24:40.478,00:24:41.980,Yeah.
00:24:42.113,00:24:44.516,My dad wants me to get a tutor.
00:24:45.884,00:24:48.486,Forget about her. I'll help you out.
00:24:49.588,00:24:53.625,I have to pass. I can't goof around anymore.
00:24:53.758,00:24:55.794,He's always so worried.
00:26:26.017,00:26:27.986,I've been accepted!
00:26:29.721,00:26:33.591,The Ritzy Vista Country Club. My life's ambition.
00:26:33.725,00:26:36.294,"Officer, can you tell me where to catch the bus..."
00:26:36.628,00:26:40.598,...to the Ritzy Vista Country Club? Ritzy Vista Country Club.
00:26:40.732,00:26:43.268,-Here it is. -Where you going?
00:26:43.601,00:26:46.037,"This is the bus to the country club, isn't it?"
00:26:46.171,00:26:49.841,Very humorous. What do you want?
00:26:50.008,00:26:51.943,The name is Magoo.
00:26:53.178,00:26:55.880,-Hello? -Judge Stevens put me in.
00:26:56.014,00:26:57.282,-Hello? -Okay. Sit down.
00:26:57.615,00:26:58.817,Thank you.
00:27:06.992,00:27:08.159,"This way, buddy."
00:27:08.293,00:27:12.030,"My, what an impressive entrance. Look at those big iron gates."
00:27:12.630,00:27:14.966,-Wake up. -I'll kill you!
00:27:20.872,00:27:23.808,I thought you were dead. You look terrible.
00:27:23.942,00:27:26.077,It is Saturday.
00:27:26.211,00:27:29.981,Since when do you come here on Saturdays?
00:27:30.115,00:27:32.017,I brought you something.
00:27:33.418,00:27:34.886,Aren't you going to open it?
00:27:35.653,00:27:39.157,Wait. Let me pull the shades down.
00:27:41.359,00:27:44.796,-What for? -To be safe.
00:27:45.663,00:27:50.769,-The hell with this. You open it. -Relax. Open it.
00:28:01.346,00:28:03.982,"You wrapped it yourself, I see."
00:28:20.932,00:28:25.070,-Merry Christmas. -Mary mother of God!
00:28:26.704,00:28:30.041,-Where did you get this? -It's pretty real.
00:28:36.781,00:28:43.722,"E.F. Montgomery Costumes, Tappan Zee, New Jersey."
00:28:46.091,00:28:47.859,"Well, try it on."
00:28:48.359,00:28:50.361,Have you completely lost your mind?
00:28:50.729,00:28:53.498,What on earth makes you think I would put that on?
00:28:53.832,00:28:55.133,I thought you would like it.
00:28:56.468,00:29:00.305,Like it? You're a bigger fool than I thought.
00:29:00.905,00:29:05.143,Maybe I'll put it on and do a little shopping. Is that what you thought?
00:29:05.276,00:29:08.813,"The indignities I've suffered with you, I should smash you."
00:29:08.947,00:29:10.882,What you've suffered with me is nothing...
00:29:11.015,00:29:13.885,...compared to what the Israelis would do to you.
00:29:14.219,00:29:17.222,You forget that. And I'll admit that's my fault.
00:29:17.355,00:29:19.424,But don't ever forget the file I have on you.
00:29:19.758,00:29:22.393,"I tried to do things the nice way, but you don't want to."
00:29:22.527,00:29:24.129,So we'll do it the hard way.
00:29:24.262,00:29:28.900,You'll put this on because I want to see you in it. Now move!
00:30:13.211,00:30:17.315,"-I see I've been promoted. -Yeah, I know. It's all they had."
00:30:17.949,00:30:20.585,But that's a perfect fit. Checked on one of your suit coats.
00:30:21.286,00:30:24.556,-It itches like hell. -Quiet.
00:30:27.358,00:30:28.593,Put the hat on.
00:30:29.427,00:30:31.296,Please!
00:30:32.130,00:30:34.566,"-Please, put the hat on. -Good God."
00:31:03.394,00:31:05.263,Attention.
00:31:15.006,00:31:16.207,What's so funny?
00:31:19.244,00:31:20.545,March.
00:31:21.946,00:31:23.214,Do it.
00:31:24.883,00:31:26.150,I'm serious.
00:31:35.026,00:31:37.395,Stop fucking around. March!
00:31:43.334,00:31:45.270,That's it. March.
00:31:48.573,00:31:49.641,Face right.
00:31:51.309,00:31:52.644,Face right!
00:31:54.345,00:31:56.214,March.
00:31:56.648,00:31:58.082,Face right.
00:32:00.418,00:32:01.586,March.
00:32:04.055,00:32:05.123,Face right.
00:32:05.590,00:32:07.325,March.
00:32:13.064,00:32:15.066,Face right. March!
00:32:18.202,00:32:19.704,March!
00:32:32.083,00:32:33.418,"Okay, that's enough."
00:32:34.385,00:32:35.687,Stop.
00:32:41.459,00:32:43.361,Stop it!
00:33:08.119,00:33:10.421,"Boy, be careful."
00:33:10.555,00:33:13.091,You play with fire.
00:33:24.369,00:33:27.672,"Okay, I can tell you're not into this."
00:33:28.639,00:33:31.509,"No, I am. Really. It just takes me a while."
00:33:31.642,00:33:33.144,Right.
00:33:34.145,00:33:35.580,"You know why I like you, Todd?"
00:33:35.713,00:33:39.350,Because you're the only guy that never tried to impress me.
00:33:43.154,00:33:45.023,Can I ask you something?
00:33:46.724,00:33:48.359,Sure.
00:33:49.794,00:33:54.265,Do you ever wonder why people do the things they do?
00:33:55.266,00:33:56.801,Think about it.
00:33:57.435,00:34:00.271,-Okay. -Seriously.
00:34:08.046,00:34:11.783,It's better not to think. It's better to just do it.
00:34:35.339,00:34:37.542,"Who are you, kitty, kitty?"
00:34:48.786,00:34:52.623,"It's getting cold out here, kitty."
00:35:09.440,00:35:10.608,Kitty.
00:35:10.741,00:35:14.712,-I'm sorry. -We can try again later.
00:35:14.846,00:35:17.515,I don't know. That's never really happened to me before.
00:35:18.783,00:35:20.151,It's all right.
00:35:23.121,00:35:25.523,"Could you blow that the other way, please."
00:35:30.661,00:35:32.630,Maybe you just don't like me.
00:35:33.564,00:35:36.200,"No, it's not that at all."
00:35:36.334,00:35:39.770,-I really do. -Maybe you just don't like girls.
00:36:07.598,00:36:10.768,"Kitty, kitty. Kitty, Kitty."
00:36:11.836,00:36:13.304,Goodbye.
00:36:24.415,00:36:25.716,You motherfucker!
00:37:01.986,00:37:04.422,"Class, you have five more minutes."
00:37:37.021,00:37:38.856,Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.
00:37:38.990,00:37:43.694,I suggest we have a conference about Todd's first-semester grades.
00:37:43.828,00:37:45.830,In light of his previous outstanding work...
00:37:45.963,00:37:48.966,...the deterioration of his grades suggests a specific problem...
00:37:49.300,00:37:52.637,...which should be addressed before his academics are jeopardized.
00:37:52.770,00:37:56.941,I'm ready to work out a time for us to meet. Earlier is usually better.
00:37:57.275,00:37:59.010,"Sincerely yours, Edward French."
00:38:00.011,00:38:02.947,"-Jesus, man. What are you gonna do? -Fuck if I know."
00:38:03.414,00:38:06.684,"-What? -I said, Fuck if I know."
00:38:08.519,00:38:11.789,"Hey, man, you're throwing it up hard. Let it roll off your fingers more."
00:38:11.922,00:38:15.493,"-I don't need a lesson, okay? -All right."
00:38:16.994,00:38:18.963,"Man, with your dad too."
00:38:19.297,00:38:22.400,"I'm a fuck-up. My dad expects this kind of crap from me, but you...?"
00:38:27.505,00:38:30.341,"You're talking to yourself, Bowden. What's going on with you?"
00:38:30.474,00:38:33.311,Nothing. I fucked up. I'll fix it.
00:38:34.312,00:38:36.047,Whatever you say.
00:38:37.515,00:38:39.317,What's happening with you and Becky?
00:38:39.450,00:38:42.687,"-Who? -Becky Trask, idiot."
00:38:43.454,00:38:44.822,What did you call me?
00:38:48.626,00:38:53.097,"You're being a real dick, man. I've got to get to practice."
00:38:59.103,00:39:01.005,Talking to yourself?
00:39:02.840,00:39:04.742,You're being a dick.
00:40:29.427,00:40:33.531,--time for us to meet. In such a case as this...
00:40:33.664,00:40:35.966,...earlier is usually better.
00:40:36.133,00:40:39.937,"Sincerely yours, Edward French."
00:40:40.070,00:40:42.807,Who is this Edward French?
00:40:43.207,00:40:46.977,"-Headmaster? -No, he's a guidance counselor."
00:40:47.111,00:40:48.546,What is that?
00:40:48.679,00:40:52.016,He guides and he counsels. You read the letter.
00:40:54.985,00:40:56.220,What stinks in here?
00:40:57.621,00:41:00.758,"I bet it's my TV dinner, I'm afraid."
00:41:04.995,00:41:07.131,"We've got a real problem here, you know that?"
00:41:07.465,00:41:11.836,-We? I'm not the one in trouble. -We'll see about that.
00:41:12.002,00:41:16.774,Don't turn this on me. It's not my fault your grades have fallen.
00:41:16.907,00:41:20.711,That's where you're wrong. The shit you're telling me keeps me up all night.
00:41:20.845,00:41:23.914,I fall asleep during class.
00:41:27.017,00:41:28.686,I need a fucking pencil.
00:41:29.787,00:41:33.724,-Do you have one? -What will your parents do?
00:41:33.858,00:41:37.094,They're never gonna see it. That's the whole point of this.
00:41:37.228,00:41:42.233,This isn't just a little slip-up here. My parents will freak.
00:41:43.234,00:41:47.171,They'll wanna know what happened. And what happened is you.
00:41:47.705,00:41:49.673,Do you get what I'm telling you?
00:41:52.142,00:41:55.646,-I think so. -You'd better be sure.
00:41:55.779,00:42:00.184,"It's your sorry ass that winds up in jail, not mine. I need a pencil."
00:42:00.518,00:42:02.686,"A sharp one, please."
00:42:02.820,00:42:04.088,Thank you.
00:42:04.221,00:42:09.226,"Tell me, does this Edward French know your parents in a social way?"
00:42:09.793,00:42:12.263,"No, my parents wouldn't mix with a geek like him."
00:42:12.596,00:42:17.001,How about professionally? Has he ever spoken to them?
00:42:17.134,00:42:19.770,"No, I've never needed it till now."
00:42:25.075,00:42:27.211,You're messing things up with that carbon paper.
00:42:27.545,00:42:30.714,"-What do you know about it? -Here, out of the way."
00:42:30.848,00:42:35.286,I was forging documents before your parents were born.
00:42:49.166,00:42:50.801,Hey.
00:42:51.702,00:42:53.003,Hi.
00:42:53.704,00:42:56.807,"-Todd, Mr. French will see you now. -Do you know what this is about?"
00:42:56.941,00:42:58.876,"I'm sorry, I don't."
00:43:02.813,00:43:04.248,See you later.
00:43:07.685,00:43:11.889,"That's my son, he's always chewing gum."
00:43:12.022,00:43:14.258,He means the world to me.
00:43:15.159,00:43:17.294,"Hey, Todd, have a seat."
00:43:18.829,00:43:20.130,Hello there.
00:43:21.799,00:43:23.601,"It's okay, sit down."
00:43:28.272,00:43:30.674,We're just talking about what's been going on.
00:43:31.976,00:43:33.978,Do you want to talk about it?
00:43:36.947,00:43:38.349,Not really.
00:43:38.916,00:43:41.151,This is nothing to be embarrassed about.
00:43:41.885,00:43:45.789,It's not your fault. We both want to help you get back on track.
00:43:46.290,00:43:48.058,Both of you?
00:43:49.093,00:43:55.132,I must admit that the situation in Richard's home is appalling.
00:43:56.033,00:44:00.638,I was raised to believe that the man should take responsibility for his family.
00:44:01.038,00:44:06.343,But when you came to me in tears and asked me to intervene...
00:44:07.277,00:44:11.949,...then I realized this was not a matter to be trifled with.
00:44:12.082,00:44:15.953,That's why I arranged this meeting.
00:44:16.420,00:44:18.822,We all appreciate your concern.
00:44:19.657,00:44:21.325,"Todd, I've been looking at your record..."
00:44:21.659,00:44:26.296,"...and according to your progress report, every grade is way down."
00:44:26.664,00:44:29.667,"Even your strongest subject, history..."
00:44:29.800,00:44:32.369,...went from a solid A to C-minus.
00:44:32.703,00:44:35.205,Trigonometry down to a D.
00:44:37.007,00:44:40.778,"Todd, did you know you were on your way to finishing first in your class?"
00:44:41.679,00:44:42.813,Yes.
00:44:44.815,00:44:47.951,Your grandfather and I have been talking and we both agree...
00:44:48.085,00:44:50.954,"...that what's going on, with your father's work problems..."
00:44:51.088,00:44:53.824,...and your mom with the drinking...
00:44:54.858,00:44:57.961,...that maybe home isn't the best place to be studying.
00:44:58.362,00:45:03.367,So he's offered to let you study over at his place every day after school.
00:45:03.700,00:45:05.702,I think it's a good idea.
00:45:05.836,00:45:07.838,-You do? -Yeah.
00:45:08.072,00:45:10.374,"In fact, I offered to go a step further."
00:45:12.042,00:45:14.044,But it means we have to make a deal.
00:45:15.079,00:45:16.713,What kind of deal?
00:45:17.114,00:45:20.451,Finals for this quarter are in three and a half weeks.
00:45:21.385,00:45:26.090,"If you can give me all A's, then I'll talk to your teachers..."
00:45:26.223,00:45:29.193,...and see if we can't discount your midterms...
00:45:29.326,00:45:32.229,...and let this quarter's grades rest with your final exams.
00:45:32.863,00:45:36.233,"If you come back with B's or C's, I can't help you."
00:45:36.366,00:45:40.871,"But all A's, that shows everybody that you're serious."
00:45:41.004,00:45:44.108,-You can do that? -Yeah.
00:45:46.176,00:45:48.745,But first you've got to start being honest with me.
00:45:52.049,00:45:54.418,No more forging your father's signature.
00:45:55.119,00:45:57.287,No more hiding my letters.
00:45:57.988,00:46:00.190,"For now, we can deal with just the three of us..."
00:46:00.324,00:46:02.759,...if it makes things easier at home.
00:46:02.893,00:46:06.363,"But you try and pull one over on me, next time I show up at your door."
00:46:06.497,00:46:08.165,Is that clear?
00:46:11.168,00:46:13.904,-He's offering to help. -I know.
00:46:14.037,00:46:16.406,But that's a whole lot to do in three weeks.
00:46:16.773,00:46:18.442,What if I can't do it?
00:46:18.775,00:46:22.813,"Mr. Bowden, I can't thank you enough for coming down here today."
00:46:22.946,00:46:27.918,"But if it's all right with you, I'd like to talk to Todd alone for a few minutes."
00:46:30.954,00:46:32.956,It's quite all right.
00:46:33.524,00:46:38.495,"If you didn't excuse me, I'm afraid that my desire for a cigarette would."
00:46:43.200,00:46:44.801,You can take my word.
00:46:44.935,00:46:48.839,"When the time is right, I'll tell Richard about all this."
00:46:48.972,00:46:52.476,He and Monica need to know what's happening to their son.
00:46:59.216,00:47:02.886,I'll expect you after school.
00:47:15.532,00:47:17.201,He's a very persuasive man.
00:47:18.235,00:47:19.369,Tell me about it.
00:47:21.605,00:47:26.510,"Listen, Todd, I understand what you're going through. I really do."
00:47:27.110,00:47:30.847,My wife and I just went through the nastiest divorce since Henry VIII.
00:47:31.415,00:47:35.219,And I know it's not easy being a senior and only 16.
00:47:35.886,00:47:37.988,And now we're asking a lot of you.
00:47:38.889,00:47:43.860,"But your grandfather thinks you can do this. Todd, I know you can."
00:47:44.361,00:47:49.066,"So from now on, I don't want you to feel like you have no one to talk to."
00:47:49.533,00:47:53.637,"Okay? Your parents, or girl problems...."
00:47:53.971,00:47:57.374,"Anything at all, here's my home phone."
00:47:57.641,00:48:01.612,"Anything at all, anything, you call me, Todd."
00:48:02.279,00:48:03.947,Call me.
00:48:04.548,00:48:06.283,Deal?
00:48:07.584,00:48:10.487,"I'm telling you, buddy, you get past this little hurdle..."
00:48:10.621,00:48:14.591,"...I promise you, the world's going to open up for you like you won't believe."
00:48:15.959,00:48:17.394,Okay.
00:48:26.270,00:48:27.304,Bye.
00:48:47.991,00:48:51.495,"Have you lost your mind? What the hell were you thinking, Grandpa?"
00:48:51.628,00:48:55.098,-What are you so excited about? -You've got some fucking balls!
00:48:55.232,00:48:57.701,I could've screwed you up. Anything could have happened!
00:48:58.035,00:49:00.037,You played it beautifully. I knew you would.
00:49:00.170,00:49:03.040,Are you fucking drunk? I could've busted you right there.
00:49:03.173,00:49:05.609,"Yes, you could have, but you did not."
00:49:05.942,00:49:08.145,Now why was that?
00:49:11.048,00:49:15.485,Your Edward French is not going to give you any more trouble.
00:49:15.619,00:49:19.089,So now you are upset because the only way you can make things right...
00:49:19.222,00:49:20.657,...is to work.
00:49:20.991,00:49:24.628,I'm upset because you had him thinking I can do something that can't be done.
00:49:24.961,00:49:31.034,But it can and it will. You simply have to work. No more stories.
00:49:31.168,00:49:34.571,-No more screwing around. -I don't take orders from you.
00:49:34.705,00:49:37.240,"-You do now. -Oh, you think so?"
00:49:37.374,00:49:40.043,Don't forget. I can walk in there and pick up the phone.
00:49:40.177,00:49:41.411,And do what?
00:49:45.415,00:49:47.684,Did you really think that I would stand aside...
00:49:48.018,00:49:52.556,...and let you turn me in without dragging you with me? Do you?
00:49:52.689,00:49:57.561,Your American self-confidence is so bloated you've lost touch with reality.
00:49:57.694,00:50:00.197,"90,000 died in Patin."
00:50:00.330,00:50:03.367,To the whole world I am a monster.
00:50:03.734,00:50:08.572,And you have known about me all this time.
00:50:08.705,00:50:12.376,"If I am caught, when the reporters stick their microphones in my face..."
00:50:12.509,00:50:18.582,...it will be your name that I will repeat over and over again. Todd Bowden.
00:50:19.082,00:50:21.418,"Todd Bowden. Yes, that was his name."
00:50:21.551,00:50:24.421,"For how long? For months, almost a year."
00:50:24.554,00:50:27.391,He wanted to know everything.
00:50:27.524,00:50:32.562,That was how he put it. Yes. Everything.
00:50:35.031,00:50:37.768,You're crazy. They'll never believe you.
00:50:38.101,00:50:40.237,It doesn't matter.
00:50:40.737,00:50:45.041,"You're going to be infamous, boy. Take my word for it."
00:50:45.175,00:50:50.480,Do you know what such a scandal can do? It never goes away.
00:50:50.614,00:50:53.717,Not for you. Not for your parents.
00:50:54.050,00:50:58.355,"And besides, lying to judges and reporters isn't as easy as you think."
00:50:58.488,00:51:03.193,You'd have to be brilliant. Can you do that? I know I can.
00:51:04.728,00:51:10.634,There's no way in hell I can pull out of a half year slide in a few weeks.
00:51:10.767,00:51:15.605,"-That shit just doesn't happen. -Boy, the time for discussion is over."
00:51:15.739,00:51:17.073,You are going to work.
00:51:17.207,00:51:21.812,You're going to spend the rest of this quarter and all your vacation studying.
00:53:59.736,00:54:03.974,Hawthorne was one of the most interesting writers of his time....
00:54:07.611,00:54:09.512,--longitude and latitude.
00:54:10.814,00:54:23.693,"--by Y, leaving you with-- In this study, how 22 of them influenced behavioral-- Why did some people do something and others nothing at all?"
00:54:23.827,00:54:26.396,This concludes our week on the Holocaust.
00:54:26.529,00:54:30.400,"If you want to know more, you may find the Santo Donato Library...."
00:54:30.567,00:54:31.935,You are a monster.
00:54:33.303,00:54:34.871,Is this clear enough for you?
00:54:35.038,00:54:36.740,What you have done is a violation.
00:54:36.873,00:54:39.643,I wanted to know more.
00:54:40.977,00:54:42.912,A door had been opened....
00:54:45.415,00:54:47.317,-I fucked up. -You'd have to be brilliant.
00:54:47.450,00:54:50.020,Lying isn't as easy as you think.
00:54:56.292,00:54:58.962,"Boy, be careful. You play with fire."
00:55:26.856,00:55:29.492,It never goes away.
00:55:30.093,00:55:31.928,Not for you.
00:56:25.715,00:56:28.618,How about some melba toast?
00:56:28.752,00:56:30.887,-Sure. -Sure.
00:56:46.636,00:56:51.441,I would have expected you to be doing backflips down the hallway...
00:56:51.574,00:56:53.643,...after such good news.
00:56:54.944,00:56:57.080,But you're so quiet.
00:57:00.884,00:57:06.055,Today I think I will give you the day off from studying.
00:57:06.422,00:57:08.424,How's that?
00:57:11.494,00:57:17.066,How about one of my stories instead?
00:57:18.668,00:57:21.838,I still have a few good ones left.
00:57:22.572,00:57:23.807,I don't care.
00:57:23.940,00:57:30.146,Let's see. I could tell you about the special soap we made.
00:57:30.480,00:57:34.451,There's always the story of how I escaped from Berlin...
00:57:34.584,00:57:37.520,...after I was so foolish as to go back.
00:57:37.654,00:57:40.623,That was a close one. I can tell you....
00:57:42.759,00:57:48.198,"No, none of these. I think you don't seem to be in the mood."
00:57:49.866,00:57:53.102,"I think today, I will tell you the story..."
00:57:54.771,00:57:58.107,...of an old man who was afraid.
00:57:58.241,00:58:01.644,He was afraid of a certain young boy...
00:58:01.778,00:58:06.249,"...who was, in a queer way, his friend."
00:58:06.616,00:58:09.752,The boy proved to be a very good student.
00:58:11.588,00:58:15.592,But not perhaps in quite the way...
00:58:15.758,00:58:20.196,...his mother and his teachers had envisioned.
00:58:22.832,00:58:26.736,"At first, the old man disliked the boy intensely."
00:58:26.870,00:58:31.608,But then he began to enjoy the boy's company.
00:58:31.741,00:58:36.946,"Of course, there was still a great deal of distrust between them."
00:58:38.181,00:58:42.652,Each knew something the other wanted to keep secret.
00:58:43.520,00:58:47.524,"Over time, the old man felt..."
00:58:47.657,00:58:50.026,...his hold on the boy slipping away.
00:58:50.793,00:58:54.531,He thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
00:58:56.065,00:59:01.004,So one sleepless night...
00:59:01.137,00:59:03.706,...the old man got out of bed...
00:59:03.840,00:59:08.077,...and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy.
00:59:10.613,00:59:13.816,Everything he could remember.
00:59:15.652,00:59:17.820,From the first day forward.
00:59:20.623,00:59:25.728,He wrote how the boy forced his way into the old man's house.
00:59:25.862,00:59:30.934,And blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
00:59:31.100,00:59:34.237,When the boy's grades began to fall...
00:59:34.571,00:59:39.943,...he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
00:59:40.109,00:59:43.947,"At the end, his hands were stinging with arthritis..."
00:59:44.080,00:59:47.884,...but he felt happy for the first time in weeks.
00:59:51.154,00:59:52.822,He felt safe.
00:59:57.026,01:00:01.698,"The following morning, the old man put on his best suit."
01:00:01.831,01:00:04.934,And went down to one of the local banks...
01:00:05.068,01:00:08.771,...and rented a safe-deposit box.
01:00:09.739,01:00:12.842,The bank officer explained to the old man...
01:00:13.009,01:00:16.746,...that only the old man could use the old man's key...
01:00:16.879,01:00:24.621,...with one exception: The exception was in the event...
01:00:24.754,01:00:29.258,...of the box-holder's death.
01:00:32.295,01:00:35.131,-Then what? -The box would be open...
01:00:35.264,01:00:37.233,...in the presence of a bank official...
01:00:37.367,01:00:40.803,...and a representative of the Internal Revenue Service.
01:00:40.937,01:00:43.940,And the contents of the box would be inventoried.
01:00:44.073,01:00:50.113,"But in this case, they would only find a 12-page document."
01:00:51.314,01:00:56.152,"Non-taxable, but highly interesting."
01:00:57.654,01:00:59.922,You didn't do this. I don't believe you.
01:01:00.056,01:01:04.761,"My boy, it is already done."
01:01:04.894,01:01:06.429,Look at you!
01:01:07.063,01:01:09.065,You could go at any time.
01:01:12.035,01:01:13.903,Don't be so theatrical.
01:01:14.037,01:01:18.041,A man five years older than me worries more about his failing heart...
01:01:18.174,01:01:22.245,...than being sent off to Israel.
01:01:22.779,01:01:26.349,"And the day will come, if I live long enough..."
01:01:26.683,01:01:30.086,...when I decide that what you know no longer matters.
01:01:30.219,01:01:35.158,"Then and only then, I will destroy the document."
01:01:35.291,01:01:39.896,"So many things can happen. Accidents, sickness."
01:01:40.029,01:01:41.698,You could slip in the shower!
01:01:41.831,01:02:03.252,Que sera sera Whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que sera sera I can see you're thinking it now. Even now.
01:02:03.720,01:02:07.190,It's in your eyes. Killing me.
01:02:08.257,01:02:11.761,All it would take is the flick of a knife.
01:02:12.128,01:02:15.198,Push me down the steps. Make it look like an accident.
01:02:15.398,01:02:19.035,I'm old. You are strong and angry.
01:02:19.168,01:02:25.374,"Good assets for killing, but there is something missing."
01:02:27.176,01:02:31.781,To have someone in your control.
01:02:34.016,01:02:38.221,To have them know that they are alive...
01:02:38.354,01:02:43.025,...only because you have not decided to the contrary.
01:02:44.127,01:02:48.131,Do you have that power? Ask yourself.
01:02:48.264,01:02:51.834,It's not an easy question. I think you know that.
01:02:58.941,01:03:01.043,"You know this means we're through, don't you?"
01:03:02.245,01:03:05.948,You won't be seeing me around here anymore.
01:03:07.450,01:03:09.919,I suppose I won't.
01:03:16.092,01:03:18.060,What are you doing?
01:03:19.061,01:03:21.898,This is the end.
01:03:24.467,01:03:26.102,Here.
01:03:30.339,01:03:34.177,Drink. To our lives together.
01:03:34.310,01:03:37.213,The beginning and the end.
01:03:46.088,01:03:47.957,I think you should fuck yourself.
01:03:48.090,01:03:51.227,"Oh, my dear boy, don't you see?"
01:03:51.828,01:03:54.497,We are fucking each other.
01:04:07.977,01:04:09.412,A strike!
01:04:11.013,01:04:12.381,Two outs.
01:04:38.474,01:04:40.509,What are you guys waiting for? Let's go!
01:04:42.011,01:04:44.213,"Come on, rebound the ball. Move it!"
01:06:38.260,01:06:40.329,Watch your step.
01:07:15.431,01:07:16.732,Sir?
01:07:17.767,01:07:19.568,Excuse me.
01:07:20.469,01:07:22.071,Sir?
01:07:25.608,01:07:28.144,I could help you carry those.
01:07:28.277,01:07:30.279,You don't gotta be afraid. I could help you.
01:07:30.413,01:07:32.748,I don't need your help.
01:07:33.682,01:07:36.419,I'm not a bad guy. You don't have to worry.
01:07:36.552,01:07:41.824,"-Please, I just want-- -What? Why do you bother me?"
01:07:42.158,01:07:46.695,We're practically neighbors. I stay right over there most nights.
01:07:46.829,01:07:49.398,I see you walk down the street.
01:07:49.532,01:07:52.268,I just want to help.
01:07:52.401,01:07:54.070,It's called being neighborly.
01:07:54.570,01:07:56.238,Piss off.
01:07:56.605,01:08:01.477,You don't-- You don't-- There's no reason to be rude.
01:08:03.746,01:08:06.082,I know something about you.
01:08:09.351,01:08:11.454,I know you're a nice guy.
01:08:13.856,01:08:17.293,I'm nice too. Just like the boy.
01:08:19.628,01:08:21.697,I see.
01:08:22.331,01:08:26.635,I'm not ashamed to say that I could use a drink about now.
01:08:28.370,01:08:30.372,But I don't take no charity.
01:08:31.607,01:08:35.778,"If you were to invite me in like a friend, we could have a drink."
01:08:36.112,01:08:39.248,-A drink? -That's what I'm saying.
01:08:40.649,01:08:42.751,You smell like a toilet.
01:08:44.253,01:08:46.489,Maybe you'll let me use your shower.
01:08:46.889,01:08:48.390,But first a drink.
01:08:49.125,01:08:50.759,Then I will do anything you say.
01:09:06.275,01:09:11.680,"I had him hooked up, rolling, four and a half, three minutes."
01:09:11.814,01:09:15.751,That was my best. I was moving double-time.
01:09:16.585,01:09:23.292,I didn't see that dog in the back seat.
01:09:23.425,01:09:24.593,Didn't see it.
01:09:24.727,01:09:27.663,-What dog? -That dog. I heard it barking.
01:09:27.796,01:09:30.633,"I hear dogs barking all the time, even when they ain't there."
01:09:30.766,01:09:32.535,So I didn't pay no mind.
01:09:32.668,01:09:41.911,So the DOT didn't want to hire me because of that thing with the-- Anyway.... Who wants to talk about that?
01:09:42.845,01:09:47.650,So I was an independent.
01:09:49.185,01:09:52.421,It meant that I could go all over. The whole city.
01:09:52.555,01:09:54.590,I believe...
01:09:55.624,01:09:58.794,...we need another bottle.
01:10:00.362,01:10:03.332,If you're offering I will accept.
01:10:04.300,01:10:08.837,It's no trouble at all. Why don't you take mine?
01:10:10.406,01:10:12.241,Thank you.
01:10:16.912,01:10:18.981,So like I was saying...
01:10:19.815,01:10:23.419,...I worked as an independent.
01:10:23.819,01:10:26.522,"The DOT, they wouldn't hire me."
01:10:26.655,01:10:31.527,So I was able to go all over the whole city.
01:10:32.261,01:10:37.366,"-Midtown, downtown-- -Where is my bottle opener?"
01:10:38.500,01:10:41.237,You stay right there.
01:10:50.446,01:10:55.517,So then I moved on. Washington Heights was always good.
01:11:00.823,01:11:04.827,"The Dominicans there, they like to...."
01:11:16.739,01:11:20.709,Then they dropped that cinder block on that cop and it got all crazy.
01:11:20.843,01:11:23.412,But you've got to be moving because they come back...
01:11:23.545,01:11:25.681,...they catch you hooking their ride.
01:11:51.440,01:11:53.575,Do you mind?
01:11:54.777,01:11:58.314,"No, not at all."
01:12:09.391,01:12:10.993,"You know, maybe in the morning..."
01:12:11.327,01:12:15.097,"...after everything goes okay, you could let me have $10."
01:12:15.631,01:12:17.700,"Yeah, perhaps."
01:12:20.703,01:12:22.338,Maybe even 20.
01:12:23.105,01:12:25.474,"Perhaps, we shall see."
01:12:26.075,01:12:28.744,You can relax. I've done this before.
01:12:29.745,01:12:30.879,That's all right.
01:12:32.548,01:12:35.551,-So have I. -Let me go pee first.
01:13:48.123,01:13:50.192,Did you look at this before you signed it?
01:13:50.526,01:13:52.828,That bill was written in Japanese.
01:13:52.961,01:13:55.097,Numbers are numbers in any language.
01:13:55.431,01:13:58.867,"Well, that man did not speak one word of English."
01:13:59.001,01:14:02.171,"The point is, you look before paying a bill."
01:14:02.504,01:14:05.808,I didn't understand what he said. That's exactly the point.
01:14:06.842,01:14:09.978,Hello? Yes.
01:14:10.546,01:14:11.713,Maybe it was in yen.
01:14:13.115,01:14:14.650,-Sure. -Maybe it is.
01:14:15.818,01:14:19.455,"Todd, it's Mr. Denker. He sounds very anxious."
01:14:23.992,01:14:28.597,"-Why would he be calling now? -Come over right away, boy."
01:14:28.997,01:14:32.067,I'm having a heart attack. A bad one.
01:14:33.635,01:14:37.139,"That sounds exciting, Mr. Denker, but I have to study my trig."
01:14:37.473,01:14:40.576,I understand you cannot talk but you can listen.
01:14:41.109,01:14:44.980,I cannot call an ambulance. I need help.
01:14:45.714,01:14:48.250,And that means you need help.
01:14:48.617,01:14:53.121,-If you put it that way. -Tell your parents I have a letter.
01:14:53.789,01:14:58.260,"-And I need you to read it to me. -Sure, I'll be right over."
01:14:59.895,01:15:02.998,Now we'll see what you're made of.
01:15:20.682,01:15:22.084,What happened?
01:15:23.652,01:15:27.289,-Where are you bleeding? -It's not my blood.
01:15:27.789,01:15:31.026,"It was self-defense. Boy, now listen."
01:15:31.159,01:15:33.829,-What are you talking about? -Shut up!
01:15:33.962,01:15:37.933,Nobody comes here until you have done what needs to be done.
01:15:39.535,01:15:41.069,Go down the steps.
01:15:52.548,01:15:54.550,What did you do?
01:15:54.850,01:15:57.653,Go down the steps.
01:15:57.786,01:15:59.555,That's right.
01:16:11.667,01:16:13.168,Hey!
01:16:14.970,01:16:18.307,Let me the fuck out of here. Let me the fuck out of here.
01:16:18.640,01:16:22.010,"If you won't help me, I have to make you."
01:16:22.144,01:16:25.647,That's enough! That's enough! That's enough!
01:16:31.753,01:16:32.854,Fuck you!
01:16:33.322,01:16:37.759,If you're going to behave like a fucking schoolgirl....
01:16:41.263,01:16:43.231,I'm going to break your goddamn door down!
01:16:45.334,01:16:46.802,Fuck!
01:16:52.274,01:16:54.977,"Don't be afraid, boy."
01:16:59.247,01:17:03.385,-Now what are you doing? -I'll break the goddamn door down.
01:17:03.719,01:17:05.621,What are you doing?
01:17:07.990,01:17:09.691,There is no point.
01:17:42.824,01:17:44.192,Why are you doing this?
01:19:18.153,01:19:20.789,Call an ambulance.
01:19:24.259,01:19:26.094,The key.
01:19:29.030,01:19:33.001,"The key of the safe-deposit box, where is it?"
01:19:33.869,01:19:36.838,"Boy, I need a doctor."
01:19:37.172,01:19:38.874,Now.
01:19:39.908,01:19:41.443,Give me the key.
01:19:45.313,01:19:47.182,I'm dying.
01:19:50.185,01:19:51.553,I know.
01:19:59.127,01:20:05.066,"Oh, no. Not like this. Please."
01:20:18.113,01:20:20.248,"You did good, son."
01:20:21.149,01:20:23.185,You did real good.
01:20:46.041,01:20:49.845,It's a good thing you called us when you did. You saved his life.
01:21:24.379,01:21:28.884,"Dad, come on, let's go make sure he gets checked-in all right."
01:22:36.952,01:22:39.087,You shouldn't have.
01:22:40.689,01:22:42.490,It's from my mother.
01:22:48.663,01:22:53.101,They say the operation was a success.
01:22:54.336,01:22:58.306,They say I have another 20 years.
01:22:59.407,01:23:02.978,A new lease on life.
01:23:16.391,01:23:18.526,I took care of everything.
01:23:19.361,01:23:21.496,Except for the key. Where is it?
01:23:29.504,01:23:32.340,There's no safe-deposit box.
01:23:34.142,01:23:36.144,There never was.
01:23:37.345,01:23:38.613,I lied.
01:23:40.648,01:23:45.020,"I had to protect myself from you, boy."
01:23:45.153,01:23:47.155,You understand?
01:23:53.595,01:23:58.666,I suspect that we will never see each other again.
01:23:59.267,01:24:01.236,"-No, we won't. -Wait."
01:24:03.138,01:24:05.373,I want to ask you something.
01:24:08.176,01:24:09.577,What?
01:24:12.247,01:24:15.083,What did it feel like?
01:24:25.193,01:24:27.295,-I better go. -Wait.
01:24:29.531,01:24:34.803,Perhaps I could persuade you to stay.
01:24:35.370,01:24:40.742,Just until I fall asleep. My medicine makes me drowsy.
01:24:42.610,01:24:44.312,Please?
01:25:16.144,01:25:18.279,"Excuse me, young man."
01:25:18.413,01:25:21.749,You are a very good boy to visit your grandfather like that.
01:25:22.383,01:25:24.385,"Thank you, but he's just a friend."
01:25:24.519,01:25:28.223,Then you are a very good friend.
01:25:28.756,01:25:30.358,Tell me.
01:25:32.393,01:25:35.196,Is he very bad off? He doesn't talk much.
01:25:35.330,01:25:38.700,-The doctors say he'll be out soon. -That's good news.
01:25:38.833,01:25:43.204,"From his accent, I would guess he was German."
01:25:43.338,01:25:46.608,"-From the south, I think. -I don't know."
01:25:47.642,01:25:50.712,I wonder if he was in the war?
01:25:51.813,01:25:54.549,I don't think so. He's never mentioned it anyway.
01:25:54.682,01:25:56.784,"It doesn't matter, I suppose."
01:25:57.152,01:25:59.554,"It was a long time ago, the war."
01:25:59.687,01:26:02.891,"Soon, in this country, we will have a president..."
01:26:03.224,01:26:06.895,...born after the war was over.
01:26:07.595,01:26:08.897,How about that?
01:26:10.365,01:26:15.537,-I'm sure you're right. -He's so very lucky to have you.
01:26:15.703,01:26:22.844,"A great man once said: No man is an island, entire of itself."
01:26:23.178,01:26:24.812,John Donne.
01:26:24.946,01:26:27.815,"-Have a nice evening, sir. -Goodbye."
01:26:41.863,01:26:46.568,-I don't have to listen to that talk. -How about this kind of talk?
01:26:53.741,01:26:55.843,That's just a warning.
01:26:57.512,01:27:00.882,"If you crave for Florence's food, that's a weird craving."
01:27:01.950,01:27:04.419,Jenny's the one who's pregnant.
01:27:04.552,01:27:07.922,They said they had something to tell us. Something important.
01:27:08.256,01:27:11.726,We're going to be grandparents again.
01:27:11.893,01:27:14.495,I just can't wait to tell everybody.
01:29:15.049,01:29:18.619,What's wrong? What's wrong?
01:29:19.721,01:29:21.356,What's wrong?
01:29:53.387,01:29:54.889,Yes.
01:29:55.790,01:29:57.024,I'm speaking to you.
01:30:18.813,01:30:22.049,Mr. Kramer is recuperating elsewhere.
01:30:22.517,01:30:25.920,"-Are you awake now, Dussander? -Yes, of course."
01:30:26.053,01:30:30.558,But you seem to have confused me with someone else.
01:30:31.526,01:30:33.895,My name is Denker.
01:30:34.729,01:30:37.532,Perhaps you need a different room.
01:30:37.698,01:30:41.469,"My name is Weiskopf, and you are Kurt Dussander."
01:30:41.602,01:30:43.971,"No, I know no one by that name."
01:30:44.839,01:30:47.909,Should I call the nurse?
01:30:49.744,01:30:52.980,The man in the next bed was Benjamin Kramer.
01:30:53.114,01:30:56.217,He was imprisoned for 10 months at Patin.
01:30:56.551,01:31:00.121,You were responsible for the death of his wife and two daughters.
01:31:00.454,01:31:04.826,My name is Denker. Arthur Denker. I am an American.
01:31:04.992,01:31:10.631,Don't bother. Your papers won't stand up to serious examination.
01:31:11.699,01:31:14.569,-We have all we need here. -Who are these men?
01:31:14.735,01:31:18.840,"I'm Dan Richler, FBI. This is Detective Getty, LAPD."
01:31:18.973,01:31:23.978,You know who I work for. When you're strong enough you will be moved.
01:31:24.145,01:31:27.648,"Until then, this entire ward will be under guard."
01:31:27.782,01:31:31.986,You can expect to be in Jerusalem by the end of the summer.
01:31:50.571,01:31:54.108,-Where do you want us to sit? -Anywhere but the front row.
01:31:54.775,01:31:58.813,-There's Carla. -Carla! How are you?
01:31:59.046,01:32:00.281,"Hi, Chelsea."
01:32:00.615,01:32:04.051,Hi. Congratulations. It's a big day for everybody.
01:32:11.893,01:32:15.630,"-Hey, Todd. -Mr. French."
01:32:15.763,01:32:18.966,"You did it, buddy. I knew you could. I'm so proud of you."
01:32:19.100,01:32:21.269,"-Thank you. -Oh, hi. These must be your parents."
01:32:21.602,01:32:23.537,-Ed French. -Dick Bowden.
01:32:23.671,01:32:24.939,Nice to meet you.
01:32:25.072,01:32:27.942,Your son really pulled one off. You must be very proud.
01:32:28.075,01:32:30.211,"-Yes, we are. -This is my wife, Monica."
01:32:30.544,01:32:31.946,Are you a teacher of Todd's?
01:32:33.214,01:32:35.650,"Actually, I'm his guidance counselor."
01:32:35.950,01:32:37.218,Nice to meet you.
01:32:37.551,01:32:40.888,I was looking forward to seeing your grandfather. Where is he?
01:32:41.022,01:32:45.159,It's a long trip from Charlotte. He's been in a wheelchair for years.
01:32:45.293,01:32:49.664,They don't get out here much. Usually Thanksgiving.
01:32:52.166,01:32:56.003,I'm sorry. I don't understand.
01:32:58.706,01:33:01.275,-That's your cue. -That's my cue.
01:33:01.609,01:33:02.910,Okay. Good luck up there.
01:33:03.110,01:33:04.845,-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
01:33:04.979,01:33:06.580,"Take care, Ed."
01:33:09.984,01:33:13.821,I don't feel so well. Maybe after the ceremony we could go straight home?
01:33:14.255,01:33:17.992,-Are you okay? What's the matter? -You know what? It's probably nerves.
01:33:18.125,01:33:20.962,-Just take a deep breath. -Let's see how it goes.
01:33:25.032,01:33:29.837,All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction.
01:33:32.306,01:33:36.644,"It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper..."
01:33:36.777,01:33:40.881,...that propels a civilization to greatness.
01:33:41.015,01:33:44.752,All of us have heard the story of Icarus.
01:33:44.885,01:33:47.755,The young boy who took the wings his father built for him.
01:33:48.389,01:33:52.259,Wings that were meant to carry him over the ocean to freedom.
01:33:52.393,01:33:56.797,And used them instead for a joyride.
01:34:07.675,01:34:12.747,For a brief moment Icarus felt what it was like to live as a god.
01:34:13.414,01:34:15.182,To touch the sun.
01:34:15.950,01:34:17.752,To soar above the common man.
01:34:18.853,01:34:22.156,And for doing so he paid the ultimate price.
01:34:23.891,01:34:27.128,You boys better come down to the cellar. You're not gonna believe this.
01:34:27.261,01:34:36.437,"Like Icarus, we too have been given gifts: Knowledge, education, experience."
01:34:37.872,01:34:41.776,And with these gifts comes the responsibility of choice.
01:34:41.909,01:34:45.312,We alone decide how our talents are bestowed upon the world.
01:34:45.679,01:34:50.818,"This is our destiny, and we hold it in the palm of our hands."
01:35:47.975,01:35:52.413,"--an investigation by local police, the sheriff's department, FBI..."
01:35:52.746,01:35:54.882,...and the Department of Justice.
01:35:55.015,01:35:57.918,Police have confirmed that a body has been found...
01:35:58.052,01:36:00.421,...in the basement of Arthur Denker...
01:36:00.754,01:36:05.526,...the Santo Donato resident believed to be a Nazi war criminal.
01:36:05.893,01:36:08.762,The cause of death has not been revealed.
01:36:08.896,01:36:12.032,Authorities are withholding identification of the body...
01:36:12.166,01:36:14.869,...until more information is available.
01:36:15.002,01:36:19.440,The apprehension of Dussander brings to a close a manhunt...
01:36:19.773,01:36:23.444,...that's been underway for 40 years in three continents.
01:36:34.889,01:36:37.791,I'll be taking care of you from now on.
01:36:39.894,01:36:41.795,Just try to relax.
01:36:44.331,01:36:48.903,"Todd, I'm Dan Richler with the FBI, and this is Dr. Weiskopf."
01:36:49.036,01:36:52.506,I'd like to hear about your involvement with Dussander.
01:36:52.840,01:36:55.042,"Actually, you knew him as Arthur Denker."
01:36:55.176,01:36:57.578,-Yes. -How did you know him?
01:36:57.912,01:37:02.249,"-You sure you feel up to this? -Yeah, I'll be fine."
01:37:09.190,01:37:11.358,Let me tell you what we're interested in here.
01:37:11.492,01:37:16.964,You said Denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter.
01:37:17.097,01:37:20.100,-Yes. -Was it in English or German?
01:37:20.234,01:37:21.502,German.
01:37:23.037,01:37:25.839,-You speak German? -No.
01:37:25.973,01:37:28.175,So you had no idea what you were reading?
01:37:28.309,01:37:32.479,"No, but he seemed to understand every word I was saying."
01:37:38.485,01:37:42.489,"What we can't seem to figure out is the letter, Todd."
01:37:42.623,01:37:45.492,Do you have any idea what happened to it?
01:37:45.626,01:37:48.529,I guess it's still on the table. I couldn't swear to it though.
01:37:48.862,01:37:51.031,-Then it should still be there. -It isn't.
01:37:51.165,01:37:54.935,"No. When you arrived, Mr. Bowden, did you see it?"
01:37:55.636,01:37:59.640,"No, but I wasn't looking for a letter. I was concerned about Todd."
01:37:59.974,01:38:01.542,Maybe someone broke in and took it.
01:38:01.875,01:38:04.311,Why would somebody break into a house to steal a letter?
01:38:04.445,01:38:07.147,"Unless, of course, they wanted to protect him."
01:38:07.281,01:38:10.451,A close friend. Another fugitive.
01:38:10.584,01:38:14.188,I know all this sounds like Robert Ludlum kind of stuff...
01:38:14.321,01:38:16.390,...but while Dussander was in the hospital...
01:38:16.523,01:38:21.528,...our Mr. X scooted over to the house and swiped the letter.
01:38:21.895,01:38:24.465,-That doesn't make sense. -Why not?
01:38:27.434,01:38:31.605,"If he had an old Nazi buddy in town, why didn't he read the letter?"
01:38:31.939,01:38:35.509,Maybe he's in a wheelchair or maybe he's blind.
01:38:35.643,01:38:39.580,Guys that are blind don't normally go scooting out to steal letters.
01:38:42.283,01:38:45.019,Did he ever talk about his past?
01:38:49.556,01:38:50.658,No.
01:38:52.026,01:38:55.262,"Excuse me, Dr. Weiskopf, I'm just curious, what kind of doctor are you?"
01:38:55.396,01:38:57.631,I'm a school teacher.
01:38:59.033,01:39:02.536,Dr. Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic Institute in Munich.
01:39:02.670,01:39:05.606,He assists the Israeli government in certain matters.
01:39:44.578,01:39:47.147,"Hey, buddy, you okay?"
01:39:49.116,01:39:50.517,"Yeah, I'm fine."
01:39:51.251,01:39:52.720,-Are you sure? -Yeah.
01:39:55.689,01:39:59.593,I just can't believe it. Even after what those guys told me.
01:39:59.727,01:40:01.228,It's mind boggling.
01:40:01.362,01:40:04.998,Your mother and I feel terrible about this. Like we let you down.
01:40:05.132,01:40:06.734,It's not your fault.
01:40:07.768,01:40:10.304,We're going to talk to a lawyer.
01:40:10.771,01:40:12.339,He's very good.
01:40:12.506,01:40:15.476,It's nothing to worry about. I just don't trust these cops.
01:40:16.343,01:40:20.347,Okay. I think that's a good idea.
01:40:20.481,01:40:23.684,Your old man's on top of this. All right? I'll take care of this.
01:40:24.418,01:40:25.452,I know.
01:40:28.555,01:40:31.058,-Dad. -Yeah?
01:40:31.792,01:40:34.395,I really never knew anything about this.
01:40:35.295,01:40:37.097,I never thought you did.
01:40:37.431,01:40:39.032,I know.
01:40:40.134,01:40:42.035,See you later.
01:40:48.041,01:40:50.177,Are you going to talk to the boy again?
01:40:50.778,01:40:52.579,I don't think so.
01:40:53.347,01:40:56.550,Somehow he didn't even....
01:40:58.285,01:41:00.587,When you were a boy...
01:41:01.588,01:41:03.457,...what did you do for fun?
01:41:04.625,01:41:06.059,I went to the movies.
01:41:08.162,01:41:12.399,-Why? What did you do? -I used to chase girls.
01:41:16.069,01:41:19.273,And now I chase old men.
01:41:48.235,01:41:50.304,"Special Agent Richler, Dr. Weiskopf..."
01:41:50.437,01:41:54.708,...this is the hospital administrator and his chief of staff.
01:41:54.842,01:41:56.376,-How do you do? -How do you do?
01:41:56.510,01:42:00.247,-So do we have a plan? -They've arranged an exit for us.
01:42:12.392,01:42:14.862,"-Mr. French. -Hello, Todd."
01:42:15.195,01:42:16.797,What are you doing here?
01:42:26.406,01:42:28.675,I came by to see your parents. Are they home?
01:42:29.376,01:42:30.911,No. What about?
01:42:31.578,01:42:35.782,-That's between me and them. -Why isn't it between you and me?
01:42:37.317,01:42:38.552,Wanna tell me what happened?
01:43:42.549,01:43:45.452,He needs to be turned on his left side.
01:43:45.786,01:43:47.554,Get him over. Get him over.
01:43:49.356,01:43:51.491,I wouldn't know where to begin.
01:43:51.692,01:43:53.860,"You're gonna have to tell me something, Todd."
01:43:55.762,01:43:59.666,I can tell you that it'd be better if we both just forgot about that.
01:44:00.901,01:44:03.570,"I'm sorry, I can't do that."
01:44:07.341,01:44:09.910,"-Can you hear me, sir? -Get the crash cart right now!"
01:44:13.747,01:44:16.817,Tell your parents I'll be back to see them later.
01:44:18.518,01:44:20.454,Mr. French.
01:44:21.321,01:44:24.257,-What? -I thought we had a deal here.
01:44:24.391,01:44:27.327,Pull up your grades and the world will open up for you.
01:44:27.461,01:44:29.296,You want me to forget about this?
01:44:29.429,01:44:31.765,I just wanna go to college and get on with my life.
01:44:31.932,01:44:34.768,"Todd, okay, we're not gonna talk about this right now."
01:44:34.901,01:44:38.305,It was a mistake to come here. I'll do this over the phone.
01:44:39.272,01:44:40.674,Clear the way. Move it!
01:44:42.943,01:44:46.279,"Can I ask you something, Ed? You don't mind if I call you Ed, do you?"
01:44:46.413,01:44:48.415,Now that I'm out of your fucking school?
01:44:53.820,01:44:55.889,-Does it ever work? -What?
01:44:56.023,01:44:58.759,I really wanna know. Or am I the first one?
01:44:58.892,01:45:02.496,"If I'm the first, I'm flattered, but somehow I can't believe that."
01:45:02.629,01:45:04.431,Not after you fixing my grades.
01:45:04.564,01:45:06.333,Giving me your home phone number.
01:45:06.466,01:45:08.468,Coming out here when my parents aren't home.
01:45:08.602,01:45:12.305,-What are you talking about? -You've got some balls!
01:45:13.740,01:45:15.776,Is this why your wife left you?
01:45:23.684,01:45:26.987,You must really have wanted to shake my hand or something else.
01:45:27.320,01:45:31.725,Now wait a minute. Are you going to tell people I did something to you?
01:45:31.858,01:45:34.961,I don't wanna drag you down with me. But I will.
01:45:35.529,01:45:37.731,-I'm better at this than you are. -Better at what?
01:45:37.864,01:45:40.634,-I'm trying to help you. Can't you see? -You helped enough.
01:45:40.767,01:45:44.337,-I won't just do nothing. -You're going to fucking have to!
01:45:45.739,01:45:47.774,-Still flatline. -Clear!
01:45:49.342,01:45:51.378,The things I'm going to say...
01:45:52.512,01:45:55.849,...they'll never go away. Not for you.
01:45:57.818,01:45:59.419,Think of your job.
01:46:02.355,01:46:03.557,Think of your son.
01:46:03.790,01:46:05.625,And clear.
01:46:06.893,01:46:08.562,And clear.
01:46:20.507,01:46:22.809,"So what's the story here, Ed?"
01:46:25.011,01:46:26.046,Do we have a deal?
01:46:32.619,01:46:34.688,"You can't do this, Todd."
01:46:36.923,01:46:39.493,You have no idea what I can do.
