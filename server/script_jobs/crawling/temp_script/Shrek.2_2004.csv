00:02:25.353,00:02:33.278,AND IT WAS DESTINY THAT HIS KISS WOULD BREAK THE DREADED CURSE.

00:05:48.640,00:05:50.892,"DONKEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?"
00:05:51.018,00:05:52.936,TAKING CARE OF YOUR LOVE NEST FOR YOU.

00:06:11.121,00:06:12.873,OR HOW ABOUT A GAME OF PARCHEESI?
00:06:13.874,00:06:15.209,"ACTUALLY, DONKEY?"
00:06:15.334,00:06:17.669,SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING HOME TO DRAGON?

00:06:25.802,00:06:28.096,"YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS HAPPY TO SEE YOU, DONKEY."
00:06:28.222,00:06:31.058,BUT FIONA AND I ARE MARRIED NOW.
00:06:31.183,00:06:34.393,"WE NEED A LITTLE TIME, YOU KNOW, TO BE TOGETHER."
00:06:36.604,00:06:38.232,JUST WITH EACH OTHER.
00:06:39.816,00:06:41.442,ALONE.

00:15:18.459,00:15:21.796,IT'S EASY TO SEE WHERE FIONA GETS HER GOOD LOOKS FROM.
00:16:00.126,00:16:02.169,- EXCUSE ME.
00:16:02.295,00:16:04.589,"BETTER OUT THAN IN, I ALWAYS SAY, EH, FIONA?"

00:16:16.392,00:16:18.978,"WHAT'S HAPPENING, EVERYBODY?"
00:16:19.103,00:16:20.605,I HAD THE HARDEST TIME FINDING THIS PLACE.
00:16:20.730,00:16:23.232,NO! NO! BAD DONKEY!
00:16:23.357,00:16:26.486,"NO, DAD! IT'S ALL RIGHT."
00:16:26.611,00:16:28.321,HE HELPED RESCUE ME FROM THE DRAGON.
00:16:28.446,00:16:30.239,THAT'S ME: THE NOBLE STEED.

00:17:10.237,00:17:12.072,I KNOW YOU AIN'T TALKING ABOUT THE SWAMP.
00:17:12.198,00:17:15.034,AN OGRE FROM A SWAMP.
00:17:16.619,00:17:19.163,I SUPPOSE THAT WOULD BE A FINE PLACE TO RAISE THE CHILDREN.
00:17:29.549,00:17:32.259,"IT'S A BIT EARLY TO BE THINKING ABOUT THAT, ISN'T IT?"
00:17:32.385,00:17:35.555,- INDEED.
00:17:35.680,00:17:38.725,- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

00:18:07.670,00:18:10.381,"NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT. RIGHT, HAROLD?"
00:18:10.506,00:18:12.508,"OH, NO! NO!"
00:18:12.633,00:18:15.845,"THAT IS, ASSUMING YOU DON'T EAT YOUR OWN YOUNG!"
00:18:15.970,00:18:18.389,- DAD!
00:18:15.970,00:18:20.934,"- NO, WE USUALLY PREFER ONES WHO'VE BEEN LOCKED AWAY IN A TOWER!"

00:18:35.573,00:18:38.076,IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE THE FAMILY TOGETHER FOR DINNER.
00:18:42.538,00:18:43.748,- HAROLD!
00:18:43.873,00:18:44.916,- FIONA!
00:18:45.041,00:18:46.417,- MOM!

00:22:51.829,00:22:54.123,I TOLD YOU COMING HERE WAS A BAD IDEA.
00:22:54.248,00:22:57.043,YOU COULD HAVE TRIED TO GET ALONG WITH MY FATHER.
00:22:57.168,00:23:01.172,"SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK I WAS GOING TO GET DADDY'S BLESSING, EVEN IF I DID WANT IT."
00:23:01.297,00:23:05.425,DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE NICE IF SOMEBODY ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED?
00:23:05.551,00:23:08.595,SURE. DO YOU WANT ME TO PACK FOR YOU?

00:23:37.250,00:23:41.295,"I'VE MADE CHANGES FOR YOU, SHREK. THINK ABOUT THAT."
00:23:43.214,00:23:47.385,"THAT'S REAL SMOOTH, SHREK."
00:24:13.244,00:24:14.578,I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

00:24:20.876,00:24:24.088,"I THINK, HAROLD..."
00:24:24.213,00:24:26.048,THIS IS FIONA'S CHOICE.
00:24:26.173,00:24:29.635,BUT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE THE PRINCE WE PICKED FOR HER.
00:24:29.760,00:24:33.889,"I MEAN, YOU EXPECT ME TO GIVE MY BLESSINGS TO THIS..."
00:24:34.014,00:24:35.557,FIONA DOES.
00:24:35.682,00:24:38.144,AND SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU IF YOU DON'T.

00:24:54.868,00:24:56.287,IT'S NOT THE SAME!
00:24:56.412,00:25:00.207,I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE THAT OUR DAUGHTER HAS MARRIED A MONSTER!
00:25:00.333,00:25:02.584,"OH, STOP BEING SUCH A DRAMA KING."

00:25:23.147,00:25:25.274,"ACTUALLY, FAIRY GODMOTHER, JUST OFF TO BED."
00:25:27.026,00:25:29.527,"ALREADY TAKEN MY PILLS, AND THEY MAKE ME A BIT DROWSY."
00:25:29.653,00:25:32.990,"SO, HOW ABOUT..."
00:25:33.115,00:25:37.328,"OH, HELLO."

00:26:11.987,00:26:17.575,SOME GENDER-CONFUSED WOLF TELLING HIM THAT HIS PRINCESS IS ALREADY MARRIED.
00:26:17.701,00:26:20.037,IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

00:32:22.482,00:32:23.859,OK.
00:32:23.983,00:32:25.903,I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

00:32:40.083,00:32:41.794,EXCELLENT IDEA!
00:32:41.919,00:32:44.463,I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING YOU MIGHT JOIN ME FOR A MORNING HUNT.

00:32:48.216,00:32:50.469,I KNOW IT WOULD MEAN THE WORLD TO FIONA.
00:32:59.853,00:33:02.856,"SHALL WE SAY, 7:30 BY THE OLD OAK?"
00:33:09.195,00:33:11.281,WE'RE LOST.

00:33:17.496,00:33:19.456,PAST THE SINISTER TREES WITH SCARY-LOOKING BRANCHES.

00:35:28.752,00:35:30.712,WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH HIM?
00:35:30.837,00:35:32.464,TAKE THE SWORD AND NEUTER HIM.
00:35:32.589,00:35:34.007,GIVE HIM THE BOB BARKER TREATMENT.
00:35:34.132,00:35:36.927,"OH, NO! POR FAVOR!"
00:35:37.052,00:35:38.386,"IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL, SEÑOR."
00:35:38.511,00:35:40.472,I DID IT ONLY FOR MY FAMILY.
00:35:40.597,00:35:43.725,"MY MOTHER, SHE IS SICK."
00:35:43.850,00:35:46.686,THE KING OFFERED ME MUCH IN GOLD AND I HAVE A LITTER OF BROTHERS...
00:35:46.812,00:35:48.981,"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!"
00:35:49.106,00:35:51.691,FIONA'S FATHER PAID YOU TO DO THIS?
00:35:51.817,00:35:54.402,THE RICH KING? SI.
00:35:56.989,00:36:00.158,"WELL, SO MUCH FOR DAD'S ROYAL BLESSING."
00:36:01.200,00:36:02.577,DON'T FEEL BAD.
00:36:02.702,00:36:04.203,ALMOST EVERYBODY YOU MEET WANTS TO KILL YOU.
00:36:04.329,00:36:05.580,"GEE, THANKS."
00:36:08.583,00:36:12.420,MAYBE FIONA WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF IF I WERE SOME SORT OF PRINCE CHARMING.
00:36:13.463,00:36:16.049,THAT'S WHAT THE KING SAID.
00:36:16.174,00:36:19.218,OH. ER... SORRY.
00:36:20.637,00:36:23.431,"SHREK, FIONA KNOWS YOU'D DO ANYTHING FOR HER."
00:36:23.556,00:36:27.102,"WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I WOULDN'T CHANGE IF I COULD."
00:36:27.226,00:36:30.229,I JUST... I JUST WISH I COULD MAKE HER HAPPY.
