00:20:11.793,00:20:14.254,So about Ju Ju… I have to tell you something.
00:20:14.338,00:20:17.257,Ju Ju's teacher told me she needs to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible.
00:20:18.926,00:20:20.219,She can't understand Korean.
00:20:21.303,00:20:22.846,She drew this.
00:20:26.975,00:20:32.022,They said in 17 years of teaching they have never seen anything this disturbing.
00:01:40.141,00:01:41.768,"-Hey. -Ah, condolences."
00:01:41.851,00:01:44.562,"-Oh, thank you. Where's Joan? -I don't know."
00:01:44.646,00:01:46.481,"Welcome back, everyone."
00:01:50.110,00:01:53.404,-Our first lady chair. -Woman chair.
00:01:53.488,00:01:55.782,Aren't you gonna sit at the head of the table?
00:01:55.865,00:01:58.368,Chair sits at the head of the table.
00:01:58.451,00:01:59.828,"Thank you, Elliot."
00:02:03.289,00:02:04.666,Is this green or brown?
00:02:06.084,00:02:09.045,Let's try this again. It's lovely to see you all.
00:02:09.129,00:02:11.256,"In a couple of minutes, we'll know if that was right."
00:02:11.339,00:02:14.134,"Okay, first order of business-- Bill's not here."
00:02:16.427,00:02:19.931,"Maybe we could cut him some slack, given his situation."
00:02:23.518,00:02:26.896,Bill is sending his daughter off to college. He'll be here any minute.
00:02:32.694,00:02:34.154,Get your shit together.
00:02:35.196,00:02:38.825,"I'm gone now, and that's the way it's gonna be for the rest of your life."
00:02:39.450,00:02:41.786,"Um, you're not… gone."
00:02:41.870,00:02:42.829,"Yes, I am."
00:02:43.329,00:02:45.290,"And what happened, happened."
00:02:46.499,00:02:51.963,"The time when people were, like, leaving casseroles and whatever at the house, it's over."
00:02:52.046,00:02:54.632,Okay. Are you finished?
00:02:56.759,00:03:00.305,I'm not gonna miss you. I'm just gonna miss this guy and this guy.
00:03:02.223,00:03:03.308,"Uh-huh, okay."
00:03:03.391,00:03:04.684,Go. Get outta here.
00:03:14.194,00:03:18.114,I'm not gonna sugarcoat this. We are in dire crisis.
00:03:18.198,00:03:20.450,Enrollments are down more than 30%.
00:03:20.533,00:03:21.910,Our budget is being gutted.
00:03:22.911,00:03:28.917,It feels like the sea is washing the ground out from under our feet.
00:03:30.960,00:03:45.892,"But in these unprecedented times, we have to prove that what we do in the classroom… stressing the value of empathy, is more important than ever, and has value to the public good."
00:03:46.976,00:03:51.231,"It's true, we can't teach our students coding or engineering."
00:03:51.314,00:04:13.628,What we teach them cannot be quantified But let us have pride We need to remind these young people that knowledge doesn't just come from spreadsheets or… or Wiki entries.
00:04:13.711,00:04:25.265,"Hey, I was thinking this morning about our tech-addled culture, and… and how our students are hyperconnected 24 hours a day, and I was reminded of something, um, Harold Bloom wrote."
00:04:25.348,00:04:30.353,"He said, Information is endlessly available to us."
00:04:31.854,00:04:33.731,Where shall wisdom be found?
00:04:36.359,00:04:39.737,They moved my office to the basement under the gym.
00:04:40.738,00:04:48.955,"All my books, my… my stuff, my drawers, dumped into these open carts that are sitting on the floor of the basement over there right now."
00:04:50.832,00:04:51.958,I heard a rumor.
00:04:52.041,00:04:55.712,They're forcing everybody over 55 to take early retirement.
00:04:57.505,00:04:59.257,"Okay, people. People, let's try not to panic."
00:04:59.340,00:05:01.759,"Well, it's easy for you to say. You're 51."
00:05:01.843,00:05:02.885,I'm 46.
00:05:03.469,00:05:04.387,You're kidding.
00:05:09.267,00:05:10.768,I want to make you this promise.
00:05:11.853,00:05:15.440,I will not allow this department to be ransacked.
00:05:16.899,00:05:18.318,This is a list of names.
00:05:18.943,00:05:23.031,These folks have the highest salaries and lowest enrollments in your department.
00:05:23.698,00:05:25.658,I'm sorry to spring this on you your first week.
00:05:26.409,00:05:29.871,"-There's no one here who's dispensable. -Oh, come on. These old-timers?"
00:05:31.331,00:05:33.624,They're averaging five students a course.
00:05:36.002,00:05:51.267,"I mean, I'm not denying their profound contribution to American letters, but… So, before I bring out the stick, maybe you could use your persuasive powers as chair."
00:05:51.351,00:05:54.437,I've got some ideas on how to increase enrollments.
00:05:54.520,00:05:57.065,"Now, Yasmin McKay is up for tenure this year."
00:05:57.148,00:05:59.901,I wanted to talk to you about giving her the Distinguished Lectureship.
00:05:59.984,00:06:03.946,"We can't talk about opening any lines, or the Distinguished Lectureship."
00:06:04.739,00:06:07.617,Student enrollment was down before. Now it's catastrophic.
00:06:07.700,00:06:10.328,Is that why you put Joan in the basement of the wellness center?
00:06:11.037,00:06:13.498,"How'd that happen? Oh, let me talk to Deb."
00:06:14.415,00:06:20.505,"Now, listen. I know you, um… I know you had big plans for this year."
00:06:20.588,00:06:24.300,I know this place is antiquated. A lumbering dinosaur.
00:06:24.801,00:06:28.596,"But you remember when I… when I called you, told you you had tenure?"
00:06:28.679,00:06:29.931,Remember what I said?
00:06:30.014,00:06:34.727,"If anyone can bring Pembroke into the 21st century, it is you."
00:06:37.188,00:06:43.361,Well… I just need three names.
00:06:54.205,00:06:55.498,Is this Sex and the Novel?
00:06:55.581,00:07:00.420,"Oh, no, this is Survey of American Letters 1850 to 1918!"
00:07:03.589,00:07:09.345,"My office hours are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:00, but you can really come anytime because I basically live here."
00:07:09.429,00:07:11.848,"Oh! If any of you are on the wait list, shoot me an email."
00:07:28.865,00:07:32.326,Hey. Thank you so much for agreeing to chair my tenure case.
00:07:32.410,00:07:34.829,-Ji-Yoon just gave me the news. -Sure.
00:07:35.746,00:07:36.831,Are… Are you okay?
00:07:37.331,00:07:40.877,Why'd she schedule two American Lit courses at the same time?
00:07:40.960,00:07:42.503,"Oh, uh, I don't know."
00:07:42.587,00:07:45.631,Maybe she thought that our content was different enough.
00:07:46.340,00:07:49.302,Sex and the Novel? That's what you're calling this?
00:07:50.303,00:07:51.220,Yeah.
00:07:55.683,00:08:06.569,"Where is it? Shoot, did I… What list?"
00:08:06.652,00:08:08.654,What if we combined your sections?
00:08:09.572,00:08:12.575,You want me to co-teach with the chair of my tenure committee?
00:08:12.658,00:08:15.912,I want him to see you in action in the classroom.
00:08:15.995,00:08:17.622,He's gonna think I'm his TA.
00:08:17.705,00:08:21.459,There's no way he's gonna be able to dismiss you when he sees how fuckin' brilliant you are!
00:08:21.542,00:08:29.759,"I already set my syllabus, so… Listen, when Bill was an undergrad, Elliot was the one who packed the halls here."
00:08:29.842,00:08:36.641,"You couldn't even get into his lectures without special permission unless you-- Yeah, and he hasn't updated those lectures in like 30 years."
00:08:36.724,00:08:37.725,Still.
00:08:38.559,00:08:40.645,He makes or breaks careers.
00:08:44.774,00:08:50.446,"I get it. When I started, it was like, Why's some Asian lady teaching Emily Dickinson?"
00:08:53.282,00:08:55.618,But we have a real opening here.
00:08:56.285,00:08:57.745,You're going up for tenure.
00:08:57.828,00:09:00.498,I-- I'm chair of this department.
00:09:00.581,00:09:06.671,"The dean has my back, so let's just get your case through, and then let's fucking shake this place up."
00:09:41.622,00:09:42.623,Shit.
00:10:01.058,00:10:02.310,Sure. Anybody else?
00:10:02.935,00:10:06.230,"When we talk about the American Renaissance, what-- Okay."
00:10:06.731,00:10:09.859,We're playing catch up here since our lectures merged.
00:10:09.942,00:10:12.945,"-Uh, you wanna help hand these out? -Um, sure."
00:10:13.029,00:10:18.284,"That's Professor McKay, by the way, who has graciously agreed to join our class."
00:10:32.173,00:10:33.424,Whoo!
00:10:34.008,00:10:35.051,Whoo!
00:10:43.100,00:10:44.101,Professor Dobson?
00:10:45.478,00:10:46.729,Are you okay?
00:10:51.525,00:10:53.277,Who popularized the phrase?
00:10:53.361,00:10:54.987,You can all probably guess.
00:10:59.408,00:11:00.493,Chaucer.
00:11:00.576,00:11:03.996,Otherwise known as the father of modern English.
00:11:04.497,00:11:13.506,You'll be astonished how many images and idioms from our everyday speech come to us directly from the 14th century.
00:11:18.010,00:11:19.512,You don't have to have an answer.
00:11:19.595,00:11:22.598,I-- I'm more interested in your questions than your answers.
00:11:22.682,00:11:26.060,It's… It's not about having a fixed analysis.
00:11:27.395,00:11:35.986,"When… When… When I get up in the morning, I'm excited to come to class, not because I get to teach you, but because I… I get to learn from you."
00:11:36.070,00:11:37.279,-Professor Kim… -Mm-hmm.
00:11:37.363,00:11:38.864,…would you be willing to sign?
00:11:39.949,00:11:42.493,We're trying to put some pressure on the administration.
00:11:43.411,00:11:44.745,"Oh, isn't this a student petition?"
00:11:44.829,00:11:47.873,"Yeah, but we're trying to get some faculty of color on board too."
00:11:49.500,00:11:50.501,Sure thing.
00:11:56.257,00:11:57.675,"Yeah. Uh, thanks again."
00:11:57.758,00:12:02.805,"Uh, I'm actually… I'm on the wait list for, uh, Death and Modernism."
00:12:08.644,00:12:11.188,"Um, my brother told me you're the reason to come here."
00:12:11.772,00:12:14.608,-What's your brother's name? -Jesse Eisenstadt. Remember him?
00:12:15.735,00:12:19.363,"Um… In my family, you're like a household god."
00:12:22.074,00:12:31.292,"I grow old, I grow old I shall wear the bottoms Of my trousers rolled What?"
00:12:32.293,00:12:33.294,I read.
00:12:51.061,00:12:53.063,"Yes, it's… terrible."
00:12:59.069,00:13:00.029,Let's go.
00:13:01.238,00:13:02.239,Okay.
00:13:06.619,00:13:08.662,They're putting me out to pasture.
00:13:09.622,00:13:12.625,I mean… what else could this be?
00:13:12.708,00:13:15.669,This is a Title IX lawsuit waiting to happen.
00:13:16.337,00:13:17.505,How do… How do you know?
00:13:17.588,00:13:20.216,Because we're gonna march over there and report it as such.
00:13:20.841,00:13:23.511,What's the point in having a Title IX office if we don't use it?
00:13:24.220,00:13:26.847,I'll make the report myself. It'll be like it was my idea.
00:13:28.098,00:13:32.394,"Our first female chair, already a troublemaker."
00:13:38.150,00:13:45.324,"Hey, uh… when's the last time you checked out your student evals?"
00:13:45.407,00:13:46.909,1987.
00:13:47.535,00:13:48.619,Will you?
00:13:48.702,00:13:51.872,I don't cater to… to consumer demands.
00:13:53.374,00:13:57.169,"-I'm not trying to be popular. -Well, then you're wildly succeeding."
00:14:02.925,00:14:08.764,"We have to retain students, or… Or? Or what?"
00:14:10.933,00:14:13.143,Larson just painted a very ominous picture.
00:14:13.936,00:14:15.688,More ominous than usual?
00:14:19.024,00:14:20.150,Yeah.
00:14:22.152,00:14:23.737,Are you asking everyone?
00:14:24.780,00:14:25.781,Yes.
00:14:26.365,00:14:29.201,"I mean, it'll take some coercion in Bill's case, but yes."
00:14:31.954,00:14:32.997,Mmm.
00:14:39.545,00:14:41.255,It's still weird between us.
00:14:41.338,00:14:43.090,"Of course it is, you moron."
00:14:44.383,00:14:53.475,Sharon died… so now there's no guardrail.
00:14:56.604,00:14:57.605,Sorry I'm late.
00:15:04.320,00:15:05.696,Give me one second.
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.828,-Where's my dongle? -Your dongle's in your hand.
00:15:14.371,00:15:16.665,-How'd that happen? -I put it there.
00:15:17.958,00:15:18.959,All right.
00:15:21.337,00:15:27.092,"We are going to start with a few images I've assembled, if I can get this thing to cooperate."
00:15:27.176,00:15:33.515,Pembroke English teacher electrocutes himself while-- Sharon?
00:15:33.599,00:15:37.394,I can't tell whether I have to take a shit or whether she's coming.
00:15:51.367,00:15:52.993,-Professor Dobson? -Oh fuck.
00:15:59.083,00:16:01.502,"Wow, okay. Um, this is Lila."
00:16:01.585,00:16:05.005,She is writing a brilliant dissertation.
00:16:07.549,00:16:11.095,"-Um, welcome to Contemporary Lit. -Death and Modernism."
00:16:13.389,00:16:15.391,Welcome to Death and Modernism.
00:16:15.933,00:16:18.936,I usually have them tweet their favorite line from Moby-Dick.
00:16:19.019,00:16:19.895,Tweet?
00:16:20.437,00:16:24.274,Last semester Call me Ishmael tied with From hell's heart I stab at thee.
00:16:24.358,00:16:29.196,"No, no, no, I want them to become absorbed in the story, in the beauty of the phrasing."
00:16:29.279,00:16:38.497,"I mean, if all they're doing is looking for the flashiest soundbite, I… It's just an exercise, so… It's low-hanging fruit."
00:16:40.082,00:16:41.709,It's a way of connecting with them.
00:16:42.209,00:16:45.045,And I find that it mobilizes the skills of close reading.
00:16:56.140,00:16:58.350,-What happened to your chair? -How did you get in here?
00:16:58.434,00:17:00.310,Couldn't bear the weight of a little Korean lady?
00:17:00.394,00:17:01.645,How did you get in?
00:17:03.939,00:17:05.607,Give me those keys. Give them to me.
00:17:05.691,00:17:07.943,"-There, you can have them. -Oh, my-- Stop it."
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.154,Give me the keys. You're not the chair anymore.
00:17:12.322,00:17:13.490,-They're right here. -Ooh!
00:17:16.493,00:17:18.454,You-- I totally have them! Yes! Yes!
00:17:20.039,00:17:21.040,Oh my God!
00:17:23.584,00:17:40.142,"Oh. No, we're just-- Well, I defended you against the hordes of actual attendees."
00:17:44.605,00:17:46.940,"No, really, how was it?"
00:17:47.983,00:17:50.235,"Uh, she read me the riot act."
00:17:50.319,00:17:54.615,"She wants me to pull my socks up, 'cause I'm on my own now."
00:17:55.157,00:17:56.700,"That's not true, I'm here."
00:17:58.911,00:18:04.666,"I mean… I mean, we're all here. I di… I didn't… I didn't… I di… Yeah."
00:18:04.750,00:18:08.879,"Uh, you know, I'm gonna give Yaz the Distinguished Lectureship."
00:18:11.381,00:18:14.009,"-He said yes? -Well… Well, not exactly."
00:18:14.593,00:18:19.973,He gave me a list of the three faculty members who are paid the highest and have the lowest enrollments.
00:18:20.057,00:18:22.017,"-Joan, Rentz, McHale. -McHale."
00:18:22.101,00:18:24.645,"I mean, he wants me to talk them into retirement?"
00:18:24.728,00:18:26.522,I hope you told him to fuck off.
00:18:26.605,00:18:28.524,I serve at the pleasure of the dean.
00:18:30.734,00:18:34.780,"You know, it's your job as chair to advocate-- Well, in five years, do you think we'll exist?"
00:18:35.531,00:18:40.327,The English Department? I feel like I arrived at the party after… after last call.
00:18:41.954,00:18:45.124,-It's also your job as chair to boost-- -Punch you in the fucking face?
00:18:53.215,00:18:54.258,Mm-hmm.
00:18:56.343,00:18:58.804,-I gotta-- I gotta get some work done. -Yep.
00:19:00.013,00:19:03.225,"Oh, and also, no more rides from female students."
00:19:05.394,00:19:07.479,My car's impounded. I'm getting it back this afternoon.
00:19:07.563,00:19:09.898,"-What are you, a spy? -What are you, a moron?"
00:19:09.982,00:19:12.317,Some flunky from the Dean of Students emailed me.
00:19:12.401,00:19:14.903,You know that was Dafna Eisenstadt?
00:19:15.863,00:19:19.158,"Eisenstadt, like Board of Trustees Eisenstadt."
00:19:21.451,00:19:24.454,Yeah. I need everyone on their best behavior.
00:19:24.955,00:19:28.000,It's important for the health of the department.
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.253,Important for the health of the department?
00:19:33.463,00:19:34.923,-I feel it now. -Get out.
00:19:48.645,00:19:49.646,"Hi, sweetheart."
00:20:00.532,00:20:01.658,I told you to take this down.
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.788,I need to talk to you.
00:20:56.630,00:20:57.631,Fourteen.
00:21:00.092,00:21:02.594,Hey. I'm not gonna die when you're 14.
00:21:03.387,00:21:04.554,How do you know?
00:21:04.638,00:21:05.639,Look at me!
00:21:09.351,00:21:11.186,"Oh, I think I just hurt my shoulder."
00:21:14.064,00:21:17.567,"If something happened to you, who would take care of me?"
00:21:17.651,00:21:19.069,Habi's so old.
00:21:19.945,00:21:22.364,You don't have to worry about that. Hmm?
00:21:23.824,00:21:26.243,"When you die, would you still remember me?"
00:21:29.288,00:21:30.289,Yes.
00:21:31.707,00:21:32.874,Want me to lie with you?
00:21:34.293,00:21:35.294,No.
00:22:32.559,00:22:33.560,Dr. Kim.
00:22:35.896,00:22:36.980,I can't find Bill.
00:22:37.064,00:22:38.148,What do you mean?
00:22:38.231,00:22:39.399,He's AWOL.
00:22:43.362,00:22:44.196,Okay.
00:22:45.238,00:22:48.825,Hey. Did you lose your phone? You're late for class. Again.
00:22:49.701,00:22:51.787,And you can't just hang out in my office.
00:23:02.255,00:23:04.299,"Oh my God. Jesus, really? Are you kidding me?"
00:23:14.893,00:23:17.479,"Um, maybe we should just start."
00:23:18.313,00:23:19.731,I'm sure she'll be here.
00:23:21.650,00:23:29.116,"First of all, I have to let you know that we are not a designated confidential resource here on campus."
00:23:29.199,00:23:36.540,"I mean, we try to maintain privacy, but if there are safety concerns in regards to-- Oh, there aren't. I'm not being stalked."
00:23:39.709,00:23:43.130,"At my age, I'm not sure there's such a thing as an unwanted overture."
00:23:45.465,00:23:47.884,-And are you yourself the complainant? -Yes.
00:23:48.885,00:23:51.263,How long have you been working here at Pembroke?
00:23:51.763,00:23:54.933,-Thirty-two years. -Wow. That's a really long time.
00:23:55.600,00:23:56.601,Which department?
00:23:56.685,00:23:57.644,English.
00:23:57.727,00:24:02.524,I wonder if I might speak with the person who's actually going to handle my case.
00:24:02.607,00:24:09.531,"Unfortunately, there isn't going to be an investigator assigned to your case until I decide whether it rises to the level of a Title IX policy violation."
00:24:11.616,00:24:17.038,They moved my office into some kind of subterranean shithole in the athletics building.
00:24:17.122,00:24:21.376,"Other instructors of my rank, all of whom are men, were not moved."
00:24:21.460,00:24:23.503,What's your relationship like with your chair?
00:24:23.587,00:24:25.797,-Have you mentioned this to him? -Her.
00:24:26.506,00:24:27.507,Sorry.
00:24:30.051,00:24:31.470,Maybe I should write myself up.
00:24:31.553,00:24:34.306,"Uh, she was supposed to be here."
00:24:34.389,00:24:36.391,This… This was her idea.
00:24:37.017,00:24:38.768,I don't know what happened.
00:24:38.852,00:24:44.441,"Ah, so she's aware that you feel that your new office is a shithole?"
00:24:44.524,00:24:47.360,-You don't think I'm telling the truth? -Truth is a very loaded word.
00:24:48.361,00:24:51.406,"If something's true, there's no moral weight applied to it."
00:24:51.490,00:24:52.657,It's a mere statement of fact.
00:24:52.741,00:24:57.204,"For example, it would be true for me to say everyone can see your fanny."
00:24:59.706,00:25:02.501,-What? -Your butt is sticking out of your shorts.
00:25:02.584,00:25:03.627,When I walked in.
00:25:04.211,00:25:11.718,"You are the first point of contact for people who are coming in here, some of whom need to report having been violated."
00:25:12.385,00:25:21.186,"Uh, and you… you… I understand you want to be body-positive."
00:25:22.395,00:25:27.150,But maybe the place to do that isn't a Title IX intake office.
00:25:27.943,00:25:34.783,"Professor Hambling, one of the great things about Title IX is that it protects women regardless of how they dress."
00:25:34.866,00:25:36.284,"You're not a lawyer, are you?"
00:25:36.868,00:25:38.119,How did you get this job?
00:25:38.203,00:25:42.916,I came from a non-profit where I helped place refugee immigrant children into foster families.
00:25:42.999,00:25:46.920,"Well, I hope they didn't have to look at your fucking fanny while you did that."
00:25:47.963,00:25:50.674,Lila mentioned there's still some holes in your syllabus.
00:25:53.635,00:25:56.888,"The kids are asking her what they're, you know, actually gonna study."
00:25:57.430,00:25:59.766,They're gonna study death and something.
00:26:00.308,00:26:01.434,Taxes?
00:26:01.518,00:26:02.519,Modernism.
00:26:02.602,00:26:04.020,"-Nah, it's not that. -Hey."
00:26:05.397,00:26:07.607,"I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it."
00:26:08.858,00:26:10.402,Get your shit together.
00:26:11.152,00:26:13.405,That's exactly what Doodles said.
00:26:13.488,00:26:16.700,"-It's funny, the two of you are like-- -There's nothing funny about it, Bill."
00:26:16.783,00:26:18.285,Pay attention to your courses.
00:26:18.368,00:26:21.580,The only reason you enroll high is because of your reputation.
00:26:24.165,00:26:25.166,What does that mean?
00:26:28.712,00:26:30.422,You need to start showing up.
00:26:31.214,00:26:32.841,Wow. Okay. Really?
00:26:33.717,00:26:35.719,"When I was chair, I didn't ride your ass like this."
00:26:35.802,00:26:38.305,"When you were chair, I wasn't fucking phoning it in."
00:26:58.783,00:27:01.161,How many of you did the reading for today?
00:27:02.662,00:27:03.747,I mean honestly.
00:27:05.665,00:27:07.542,Okay. All right. Okay.
00:27:08.918,00:27:11.129,How many of you are drunk right now?
00:27:12.547,00:27:13.465,Or stoned?
00:27:15.425,00:27:17.552,See? That's fine.
00:27:28.104,00:27:29.481,Life isn't what you think.
00:27:30.565,00:27:32.067,It'll never be what you think.
00:27:41.242,00:27:43.119,All meaning is ascribed to the state.
00:27:43.662,00:27:44.788,There is no meaning.
00:27:49.334,00:27:57.926,"The idea that we exist in a purposeless universe came about after two World Wars, 85 million dead including the camps."
00:28:02.972,00:28:03.973,Yes.
00:28:05.100,00:28:16.861,"For two people who were convinced that there's no cure for being on this Earth, that there's nothing to be done… they still tried."
00:28:19.280,00:03:25.121,"Cesare Pavese wrote that the only way to escape from the abyss is to look at it, measure it, sound its depths, and go down into it… - Can't take her today. -Appa, I have no choice."
00:03:25.205,00:03:27.749,Didn't you get a raise recently? You need a babysitter.
00:03:31.085,00:03:33.171,"Since I'm old, I can't keep up with her."
00:03:33.254,00:03:35.840,"And she doesn't speak Korean, how can I take care of her properly?"
00:03:35.924,00:03:38.343,What if something happens?
00:13:25.054,00:13:28.349,She just kept talking about Hello Kitty. It's only about Hello Kitty with her.
00:13:46.951,00:13:51.080,Ann Arbor was ranked No. 1 on WalletHub's latest list of best college towns.
00:13:52.248,00:14:01.549,"You could be in Michigan married to Peter Seung right now with a real family, and not pining for this crumpled man."
00:14:01.632,00:14:05.135,"I have a real family, and Bill's not crumpled up."
00:14:05.219,00:14:06.637,And I am not pining.
00:14:07.179,00:14:10.266,You can't compete with his dead wife.
00:14:10.349,00:14:11.308,Trust me.
00:14:11.392,00:14:12.893,We're friends.
00:00:12.095,00:00:13.638,Stop. His wife died.
00:00:13.722,00:00:16.057,That's literally the start of every romance novel.
00:00:16.141,00:00:18.143,I just like him. He's smart.
00:00:18.893,00:00:19.894,And sad.
00:00:21.146,00:00:21.980,And hot.
00:00:32.782,00:00:36.578,-What's this professor's name again? -Dobson. Bill Dobson.
00:00:38.413,00:00:40.665,You just gave your pie to a Nazi.
00:00:45.253,00:00:48.381,I left her dinner in the fridge. You're welcome to anything in the pantry.
00:00:48.465,00:00:49.466,-Thank you. -This is her.
00:00:51.259,00:00:53.386,"Come meet Vicky, uh, your babysitter."
00:00:55.638,00:00:59.142,"Come on, honey. I… I gotta go. This is a big thing for me. Come on out."
00:00:59.225,00:01:01.603,"-Are you sure she's in there? -Oh, she's in there."
00:01:01.686,00:01:03.521,She just likes to fuck with my head.
00:01:05.565,00:01:09.235,-Could I use the restroom real quick? -Of course. It's down there to your left.
00:01:09.319,00:01:10.904,I'm just gonna take a quick shower.
00:01:10.987,00:01:12.739,She'll make an appearance as soon as I'm gone.
00:01:12.822,00:01:13.656,"No worries, thanks."
00:01:50.318,00:01:51.444,Oh shit.
00:02:12.215,00:02:13.550,That's a girl's bike.
00:02:14.259,00:02:16.594,That's what the girl I stole it from said.
00:02:21.391,00:02:22.350,Someone's in here.
00:02:24.227,00:02:31.442,Uh… Um… Hi.
00:02:34.737,00:02:36.781,You must be Ju Ju. It's nice to meet you.
00:02:41.995,00:02:44.164,Can I… Do you wanna just give me a second?
00:02:45.707,00:02:47.667,Do you have fur on your vagina?
00:02:49.377,00:02:51.254,-Can I see it? -No.
00:02:51.337,00:02:53.631,It's just like any other part of your body.
00:02:53.715,00:02:54.757,"No, it isn't."
00:02:54.841,00:02:57.260,"Yes, it is, when you think about it."
00:02:57.343,00:02:59.387,"I'm so sorry, but I'm gonna have to go."
00:03:00.013,00:03:12.567,"-What? What happened? -Uh, I… This isn't… I don't wanna say that I was triggered by your daughter, Boundaries are important to me, especially in a work situation."
00:03:12.650,00:03:13.776,"Yes, of course."
00:03:13.860,00:03:16.237,"Clearly, there are no boundaries in this house."
00:03:16.779,00:03:19.574,"Oh. Please. No, Vicky. We totally have boundaries."
00:03:52.482,00:03:53.441,"Hey, guys."
00:03:56.986,00:03:58.571,"Oh, did you bake this yourself?"
00:04:00.573,00:04:01.491,Mmm.
00:04:01.574,00:04:03.534,"-Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. -No, no."
00:04:03.618,00:04:06.704,"-We're not above recycled gifts here. -Please, please, please."
00:04:08.081,00:04:09.249,"Oh, Prufrock."
00:04:09.916,00:04:11.918,"It's a little predictable, no?"
00:04:12.669,00:04:14.545,-I did not dare to eat it. -Oh.
00:04:15.088,00:04:19.259,"Oh, oh, oh, good, a sex scandal. I think that completes my set."
00:04:22.262,00:04:23.263,Be careful.
00:04:24.472,00:04:26.724,This department's hanging on by a thread.
00:04:26.808,00:04:28.268,Why don't you get an au pair?
00:04:28.351,00:04:30.436,Where's she supposed to sleep? The couch?
00:04:33.106,00:04:34.357,"-Here. -Oh. No, thanks."
00:04:34.440,00:04:37.652,She thinks she can't drink because there's a lot of bigwigs here.
00:04:37.735,00:04:39.070,It's a fine line.
00:04:39.153,00:04:41.572,You can't get Joan-drunk when you're pre-tenure.
00:04:41.656,00:04:43.032,I don't do that anymore.
00:04:43.116,00:04:46.286,You'll need to schmooze the provost and Dean Larson. Bottoms up.
00:04:52.333,00:04:58.673,I got your email about Fre-- Fr-- -Yasmin McKay. -Don't we usually get an outside person?
00:04:58.756,00:05:09.934,"Yes, but Yale and Chicago are eyeing her, and I think giving her the Distinguished Lectureship would… Right. Every time I eat mini quiche, I feel like Gulliver."
00:05:11.311,00:05:13.855,Mmm. More food!
00:05:14.605,00:05:15.481,Right?
00:05:16.107,00:05:18.443,Gulliver? Among the Lilliputians?
00:05:18.526,00:05:20.153,"Yeah, yeah, I get the reference."
00:05:20.653,00:05:24.365,"Paul, Pembroke's faculty is 87% white."
00:05:25.950,00:05:30.246,"For the last five years, you've put the same picture of me on our recruitment brochure."
00:05:30.330,00:05:31.748,We need more women of color.
00:05:33.291,00:05:39.464,"As soon as one of them retires, gets kicked out, or dies."
00:05:53.394,00:05:55.355,we'd all be teaching at home in our skivvies.
00:05:58.316,00:06:02.195,"Oh, clean as a whistle. You could serve shrimp off my colon."
00:06:05.531,00:06:07.325,I think I'll grab another plate.
00:06:13.706,00:06:15.041,-Evening. -Evening.
00:06:16.084,00:06:26.260,"Oh, that's a very nice outfit you have on. It looks like, uh… Well, it looks like three different dresses that you put together, but in a very good way."
00:06:27.178,00:06:28.179,Thank you.
00:06:28.721,00:06:30.681,Do you wanna get a coffee at the Hub tomorrow?
00:06:30.765,00:06:32.266,We could go over grading criteria.
00:06:32.350,00:06:34.352,"Well, actually, tomorrow's my research day."
00:06:34.435,00:06:36.521,"Yeah, I'll be heading to the archives."
00:06:37.146,00:06:39.315,It's delightfully peaceful there.
00:06:39.399,00:06:42.568,I know all about it. I spent half of grad school in there.
00:06:43.528,00:06:46.072,-The North Star? Oh. -The North Star. Yeah. Yeah.
00:06:50.785,00:06:53.746,Are you reading literature at a fucking party right now?
00:06:58.376,00:07:00.628,…please take me home.
00:07:03.965,00:07:05.425,-I'll think about it. -Mmm.
00:07:05.967,00:07:06.843,Mmm.
00:07:06.926,00:07:10.888,"Hey, um, do you ever read your student evals?"
00:07:10.972,00:07:15.393,"What am I asking you for? They love you. You're over-enrolled, right?"
00:07:15.476,00:07:19.897,Professor Dobson's class is like the limp-dicked version of his pretentious writing.
00:07:23.568,00:07:25.445,"Hey, I called you earlier."
00:07:25.528,00:07:30.908,"Yeah, I left the phone at home. Doodles said I'm texting too much, so… -Yeah. -How is she?"
00:07:31.492,00:07:36.330,"Mmm… -Sowing her wild oats, I hope. -Wish I had done that."
00:07:36.414,00:07:41.836,"Back when I was cute, my head was buried in Piers Plowman and Dream of the Rood."
00:07:44.380,00:07:50.052,Now my face is like this… An avalanche of charm and class.
00:07:50.136,00:07:52.430,Lovely. Lovely. Deftly done.
00:07:53.097,00:07:55.349,"Hey, I'm too drunk to lie. You know that."
00:07:56.017,00:08:00.062,And as for you… What?
00:08:01.397,00:08:02.773,You think you're ready?
00:08:03.983,00:08:07.320,For… Are you… Are we gonna do stuff?
00:08:11.324,00:08:12.658,-Sure. -You deserve it.
00:08:21.834,00:08:23.961,who wants to come and talk about Lacan.
00:08:28.841,00:08:31.552,Are you for real smoking a joint right here?
00:08:34.597,00:08:36.599,You're literally standing in a glass house.
00:08:40.061,00:08:42.688,There's a difference between legal and appropriate.
00:08:43.356,00:08:44.357,Is there though?
00:08:46.567,00:08:48.945,-Are you wearing makeup? -What? No.
00:08:50.112,00:08:51.113,It's pretty.
00:08:53.950,00:08:55.159,Mmm.
00:08:55.910,00:08:57.537,"Sports jacket, check."
00:09:04.794,00:09:08.714,"You know, you just need, um, a wide-eyed coed… Working on it."
00:09:08.798,00:09:14.929,…then you will have successfully checked every box in the disaffected middle-aged white-male-professor cliché.
00:09:18.516,00:09:19.850,How's it going in there?
00:09:20.434,00:09:24.855,I'm batting… -What's a really bad batting average? -Zero?
00:09:26.399,00:09:30.069,Larson's still squirrelly about me giving Yaz the Distinguished Lectureship.
00:09:30.152,00:09:31.988,"I mean, can't I just give it to her?"
00:09:32.071,00:09:37.910,Larson thinks because he quotes Prufrock we're not gonna notice he's nothing but a technocrat for the bean counters upstairs.
00:09:37.994,00:09:39.120,You're the chair.
00:09:39.829,00:09:40.997,I'm the chair.
00:09:42.832,00:09:43.874,I'm the chair.
00:09:44.667,00:09:45.960,I'm the chair!
00:09:46.043,00:09:47.920,"-This'll help. -Oh, no way."
00:09:48.004,00:09:49.547,What if they ask me to say something?
00:09:49.630,00:09:51.549,No one asks the chair to speak at these things.
00:09:55.720,00:09:56.721,Dr. Kim?
00:10:04.186,00:10:05.438,"Oh, there you are."
00:10:05.521,00:10:08.316,I just wanna welcome you into your new position.
00:10:08.858,00:10:15.740,"Oh, I really believe that your vision is necessary for this moment at Pembroke as we reimagine the humanities."
00:10:15.823,00:10:20.870,I'm excited to have you bring fresh ideas into one of our most venerated departments.
00:10:35.426,00:10:36.344,What's that?
00:10:42.725,00:11:12.046,"English… I'm… I'm really looking forward to the changes we see coming, and I look forward to explaining them to you at perhaps another-- You know, I have been thinking a lot about this generation of students, and… and, you know, why they're not interested in literature."
00:11:12.129,00:11:13.589,And sometimes I get it.
00:11:16.842,00:11:19.428,when there are so many things to be worried about?
00:11:20.137,00:11:24.183,Climate change. Racism. The prison-industrial complex.
00:11:26.644,00:11:28.229,These-- Oh sorry.
00:11:28.813,00:11:30.898,I'm so sorry. It's my dad. I'll call him back.
00:11:30.981,00:11:33.109,Might be important. Maybe you should take it.
00:11:36.445,00:11:44.495,"The Distinguished Lectureship this year will be given by Professor Yasmin McKay, the first woman of color to receive this honor in Pembroke's entire history."
00:11:46.872,00:11:50.042,"Oh, Though she be but little, she is fierce."
00:11:50.126,00:11:53.546,"-Merchant of Venice? -Oh, Hermione, from A Winter's Tale."
00:11:53.629,00:11:57.466,"Actually, it's Helena from Midsummer Night's Dream, but she's speaking about Hermia."
00:11:57.550,00:12:00.761,"No, no, of course you're right. And congratulations, Jasmine."
00:12:02.638,00:12:03.931,-Yasmin McKay. -Right.
00:12:04.014,00:12:09.145,"Doctor… Professor… -Professor McKay. -Right. Well, I'm bad with names."
00:12:09.228,00:12:11.772,"Joan, I see you've introduced yourself to the bar."
00:12:11.856,00:12:14.817,This is the future of American studies.
00:12:14.900,00:12:18.070,"No, no. She's rewriting the field, this one."
00:12:18.154,00:12:20.740,"Her… Her last article on, um… On who?"
00:12:20.823,00:12:22.283,-Frances Harper. -Frances Harper.
00:12:22.908,00:12:26.662,Was just selected the best essay of the year in PMLA.
00:12:26.746,00:12:27.788,And look at her.
00:12:30.583,00:12:32.209,"-Back when I was 32, my-- -Right."
00:12:32.293,00:12:35.421,I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. I will be right back.
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.424,"Don't do us any favors, fucktard."
00:12:42.052,00:12:44.305,-She's missing? -My dad can't find her.
00:12:45.347,00:12:48.434,"Um, let me take you. I don't think you should drive."
00:12:48.517,00:12:50.561,"What? No, you smoked the whole thing."
00:12:54.106,00:12:57.026,What makes you think you can drive? Your eyes are half-closed.
00:12:58.152,00:12:59.612,Is that your coat?
00:13:08.370,00:13:10.331,"-Oh. Oh, oh. -Yeah."
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.010,Three times.
00:13:23.093,00:13:24.970,Did she say anything? Are you sure?
00:13:28.432,00:13:33.187,Her favorite stuffy. She had to leave him at home because my dad hasn't recovered from the Japanese occupation.
00:13:37.066,00:13:38.067,Never mind.
00:14:21.193,00:14:22.862,What does Bill mean in Korean?
00:14:25.906,00:14:27.199,"Oh my God, there she is! Ju Ju!"
00:14:27.283,00:14:28.576,"-Ju Ju! Daddy, stop! -Ju Ju!"
00:14:32.037,00:14:34.915,"Daddy! Daddy, Daddy, just stop! Stop, stop, Daddy!"
00:14:43.299,00:14:45.634,Your lips look a little blue. You okay?
00:14:46.510,00:14:53.684,"Last time I saw you, you were this big, and now you're like this giant-- Listen, that is your one and only halahbojee. He is all we've got."
00:14:53.767,00:14:59.565,"When I was a kid, never in a million-- And you're not my real mom."
00:15:02.276,00:15:05.279,Did… Did someone say that to you again?
00:15:07.072,00:15:08.240,Was it what's-her-name?
00:15:21.462,00:15:25.215,I'm your real mom… Ju Ju.
00:15:32.640,00:15:34.391,You guys like fried chicken?
00:15:35.434,00:15:37.895,'Cause I could mess with a bucket of it right now.
00:15:37.978,00:15:39.730,-Mom? Ju Ju? -I'm starving.
00:15:39.813,00:15:42.691,I have to get back to the party. I have to put in my time.
00:15:43.275,00:15:45.903,-What are you talking about? -There'll be food there.
00:15:47.404,00:15:50.699,"-You gave a very memorable speech. -Oh my God. No. No, no."
00:15:50.783,00:15:52.910,This is not the time to slack off.
00:16:20.521,00:16:21.897,Can I see your phone for a second?
00:16:21.981,00:16:23.649,-I didn't bring it. -What?
00:16:29.697,00:16:36.787,"I got everything I need right here. I got fries, I got a beer, I got a beautiful and talented bowling companion and her mother."
00:16:51.510,00:16:52.553,Oh!
00:17:04.815,00:17:07.276,-I don't wanna mansplain. -You gonna give me a lesson?
00:17:07.359,00:17:12.322,"But you gotta, uh, you gotta let it fly. Just like-- -See the white guys? -What does that mean?"
00:17:13.615,00:17:18.579,"Well, thank you so much for that very instructive set of lessons on bowling."
00:17:30.716,00:17:32.593,-Whoo! -Is it my turn? Is it my turn?
00:17:32.676,00:17:34.428,"-Yeah, no. Help me with this. -Okay."
00:17:35.179,00:17:38.432,"It's really heavy. Okay, you can let go now."
00:17:54.239,00:17:55.949,She never crawls in my lap.
00:17:56.033,00:17:58.744,She never… She never runs to me.
00:18:03.749,00:18:10.547,"You know, for two years, I was like… What if I don't get a baby?"
00:18:10.631,00:18:13.634,What if I don't get a… What if I don't match with anyone?
00:18:19.473,00:18:46.500,"…how it would actually be when I… All the other moms in Mommy and Me were just whipping out their boobs and, like… They all seemed so ready… so natural, whereas I was like… Remember when you had to make that little book for the adoption agency?"
00:18:46.583,00:18:48.043,"Oh, the profile book?"
00:18:48.127,00:18:51.421,You put a picture of you cooking even though you don't cook for shit.
00:18:51.505,00:18:55.175,You're a fucking menace when it comes to anything that needs to be heated.
00:18:59.179,00:19:00.430,Why did she pick me?
00:19:02.182,00:19:03.934,How did I match with her?
00:19:08.063,00:19:09.565,We don't have the same color skin.
00:19:09.648,00:19:12.359,"I don't have a husband. I mean, to be her father."
00:19:12.442,00:19:17.030,"I couldn't give her siblings, I could… Not even a dog. I'm totally allergic."
00:19:19.032,00:19:26.331,"I'm just, like… a fucking raw deal… who's old as shit."
00:19:30.878,00:19:41.680,"Well, maybe Ju Ju's birth mother was raised by a really strong single mom, and saw the pictures of you, and was like, She's the one."
00:19:44.224,00:19:47.686,I mean… I'd pick you.
00:19:52.316,00:19:59.615,"Um, I'd be like… I'll eat dry cereal for the rest of my days if I can hang with this lady."
00:20:09.041,00:20:11.960,"Hey, you wanna take my car and swing by in the morning?"
00:20:15.464,00:20:16.465,Yeah.
00:20:17.090,00:20:18.091,Sure.
00:20:35.609,00:20:37.611,"-Oh God, it's stuck. -Here."
00:20:41.240,00:20:42.199,-Okay. -Can you get that?
00:20:42.783,00:20:43.867,"No, push down on that."
00:20:45.410,00:20:46.912,-Push it down. -Okay. Right here?
00:20:46.995,00:20:48.121,-Yeah. -Just like that?
00:20:48.205,00:20:49.665,"-No, down here. -Okay."
00:20:54.461,00:20:55.754,Oh my God. Hold on a second.
00:20:59.967,00:21:00.926,"Wait, wait, wait!"
00:21:05.847,00:21:08.100,"Are you okay? Oh my God, are you okay?"
00:21:08.725,00:21:10.018,"Oh my God, your foot."
00:21:17.359,00:21:19.653,"Okay. Uh, Vicodin."
00:21:20.696,00:21:21.697,Percocet.
00:21:35.419,00:21:39.131,"Uh, maybe I should, um… I should take her home."
00:21:40.424,00:21:42.009,She's sound asleep.
00:21:45.679,00:21:47.472,Don't you ever think about it?
00:21:52.102,00:21:54.730,You gonna pretend you don't know what I'm talking about?
00:21:54.813,00:21:56.773,"No, no, no, you're not ready."
00:21:56.857,00:22:00.319,Says who? Why do you get to decide when I'm ready? I'm a big boy.
00:22:00.402,00:22:01.611,You're… You're grieving.
00:22:02.446,00:22:06.408,"If I'm grieving, then why do I have a raging boner?"
00:22:11.955,00:22:14.166,-And I'm what? -And you're confused.
00:22:16.585,00:22:25.469,"Don't do that! And you're… You're, um… You're cross… You're cross-wired."
00:22:25.552,00:22:26.762,I don't think so.
00:22:29.264,00:22:30.932,"-Just… -No, no, wait. Wait, wait."
00:22:31.016,00:22:33.685,"If we got together, no one is gonna take me seriously."
00:22:33.769,00:22:39.524,"It'll be like, you know, he only supports her ideas so he can get in her pants."
00:22:40.400,00:22:42.611,I genuinely support your ideas.
00:22:43.695,00:22:46.365,And I genuinely wanna get in your pants.
00:22:48.617,00:22:50.369,Good night. Good night.
00:23:19.940,00:23:20.857,Hmm?
00:23:36.373,00:23:37.833,"Come on, babe, let's go!"
00:24:11.575,00:24:13.118,Hey. It's Ji-Yoon.
00:24:14.661,00:24:15.495,What do you mean?
00:24:24.129,00:24:34.055,"Just… Just take it easy. It's-- I know you're worried about the optics now that you're chair, but you don't have anything to prove to anybody anymore."
00:24:36.641,00:24:38.310,Look at you. You did it.
00:24:38.393,00:24:41.146,You… You ascended the ranks of your profession.
00:24:41.229,00:24:50.322,"You have the corner office and… and the publications, and this beautiful, complicated kid."
00:24:54.784,00:24:58.079,Does it ever occur to you that I could be an asset?
00:24:59.706,00:25:00.790,Value added?
00:25:12.969,00:25:17.057,No Nazis at Pembroke! No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:25:17.140,00:25:19.434,No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:25:19.518,00:25:21.811,Professor Hitler must go!
00:25:21.895,00:25:23.605,Send Professor Dobson home!
00:00:09.843,00:00:11.720,Don't say anything provocative.
00:00:13.722,00:00:15.724,"Hey, you get how much trouble you're in?"
00:00:16.766,00:00:19.185,Know how many times I've been in trouble for real shit?
00:00:19.269,00:00:21.563,"For once, I'm in trouble for something demonstrably stupid."
00:00:21.646,00:00:24.733,-You have to take this seriously. -I am. I will.
00:00:26.109,00:00:27.444,What is going on here?
00:00:28.820,00:00:31.114,I told you to pull it together.
00:00:31.197,00:00:33.867,I left it crooked 'cause I like it when you fix me up.
00:00:36.077,00:00:37.120,You smell good.
00:00:38.496,00:00:41.499,"Please, be receptive to their input, okay?"
00:00:43.084,00:00:47.047,"Yeah, I'm not about to validate the total absurdity of this proceeding."
00:00:52.135,00:00:54.554,Do you think it's acceptable to joke about Nazis?
00:00:54.637,00:01:05.690,"No, but that does remind me of this time when two Nazis walked into a bar-- We have a straightforward protocol for this sort of situation."
00:01:05.774,00:01:12.822,"The two of you, you work on a statement of apology, and then we post it on all relevant platforms."
00:01:12.906,00:01:14.699,"I'm sorry, what's your name again?"
00:01:15.200,00:01:16.743,"-Ronny. -Yeah, that's Ronny."
00:01:16.826,00:01:19.162,"Ronny. He's, uh, chief of communications."
00:01:19.245,00:01:22.957,"Some people call it crisis management, or reputation management."
00:01:24.793,00:01:25.877,I don't co-write.
00:01:25.960,00:01:27.754,How do you suggest that we handle this then?
00:01:27.837,00:01:29.756,-I'm gonna talk to them. -To who?
00:01:29.839,00:01:31.216,-To whom. -To whom.
00:01:31.841,00:01:32.759,The students.
00:01:32.842,00:01:34.928,"-No, no, no. No, no, no. -I wouldn't advise that."
00:01:35.011,00:01:36.012,I'm tenured.
00:01:36.554,00:01:44.646,"You can't constrain my actions in my own classroom or my speech on this campus unless I'm in violation of the faculty code of conduct, which I'm not."
00:01:45.814,00:01:49.150,Universities are supposed to encourage dissent.
00:01:49.234,00:01:51.528,We should be proud of these kids.
00:01:51.611,00:01:52.904,This is what they do.
00:01:52.987,00:01:58.743,"In fact, when I was an undergrad, I sat bare-ass on that very desk for South African divestment."
00:02:07.752,00:02:10.296,There are still a couple things we have to discuss.
00:02:11.673,00:02:13.299,I'll catch up with you later.
00:02:14.175,00:02:15.176,Okay.
00:02:20.431,00:02:24.310,The president is starting to get calls from donors and alumni.
00:02:24.394,00:02:29.065,"If it's not resolved immediately, I wouldn't be surprised if he asks for Bill's resignation."
00:02:29.149,00:02:32.360,"-No, he's going to apologize. -He doesn't seem remotely apologetic."
00:02:32.443,00:02:36.364,"Well, I can guarantee that after our next conversation, he will be filled with remorse."
00:02:43.121,00:02:44.414,Oh. Wait up.
00:02:46.082,00:02:48.209,I like when you act like you're my boss.
00:02:48.293,00:02:51.045,-You should've seen your face in there. -I am your boss.
00:02:51.129,00:02:55.091,"Okay. Well, then what are you doing tonight, boss lady?"
00:02:55.175,00:02:57.468,-Can I take you out for dinner? -What's the matter with you?
00:02:57.552,00:02:59.512,"No, you cannot ask me out right now."
00:02:59.596,00:03:01.848,This is a serious disciplinary matter.
00:03:03.349,00:03:07.020,"Oh, so I'm gonna let some paper pusher from HR write an apology for me?"
00:03:07.562,00:03:10.940,That's a disservice to my students. They'd smell that coming a mile away.
00:03:11.024,00:03:12.859,Know what else they'll smell coming a mile away?
00:03:12.942,00:03:15.195,This little streak of arrogance you got going on here.
00:03:15.987,00:03:20.325,"For Chrissake, I'm not a Nazi, okay? Am I not allowed-- This is not about whether you're a Nazi."
00:03:20.408,00:03:28.166,"It's about whether you're one of those men who, when something like this happens, thinks he can dust himself off and just walk away without any fucking sense of consequence."
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.797,That a no on dinner?
00:03:38.426,00:03:42.347,"Yaz hit 8,000 Twitter followers, so I posted that to the department's website."
00:03:42.430,00:03:44.682,-You posted she won the NEH Fellowship? -Yep.
00:03:44.766,00:03:48.853,"And unfortunately, I'm coming to a dead end in terms of Joan's office."
00:03:49.812,00:03:51.272,There's gotta be something we can do.
00:03:52.649,00:03:55.485,"Oh, hi. Thanks, Laurie I wanna talk to Lila for a second."
00:03:55.568,00:03:56.778,Come on in.
00:03:56.861,00:04:01.115,"I know it seems like I have been ignoring you, but it's just been chaos."
00:04:01.199,00:04:02.825,"Don't forget, you have that dinner tonight."
00:04:02.909,00:04:04.577,Oh crap. What is that again?
00:04:04.661,00:04:10.583,"At the dean's house. Maybe it's about the whole… Uh, uh-- Thanks. Thanks, Laurie. Thanks."
00:04:13.378,00:04:18.716,"My friend Sarah at Wisconsin, her adviser got accused of harassment, and his recommendation ended up being worthless."
00:04:18.800,00:04:22.011,-Nobody thinks Bill Dobson's a Nazi. -I have a mountain of student debt.
00:04:22.095,00:04:24.764,"It was a bad joke, and he is about to apologize."
00:04:24.847,00:04:26.266,People have been calling me.
00:04:28.726,00:04:29.811,What people?
00:04:31.396,00:04:34.107,"-What should I say? -Oh my God, don't say anything."
00:04:34.190,00:04:37.193,"If this gets big, it could… it could really hurt us."
00:04:44.367,00:04:53.334,"Critics hated it, and Melville died in obscurity, as he himself had predicted in letters to his friend, Nathaniel Hawthorne, to whom he dedicated the book."
00:04:55.044,00:05:01.509,Not until the 1920s was it reappraised as the seminal master-- Are we going to discuss the fact that Melville was a wife-beater?
00:05:03.678,00:05:12.145,"It is true that some feminist scholars have posited that, but in the absence of definitive proof, well, I-- I think it's best we attend to the text itself."
00:05:12.228,00:05:15.732,"We're concerned with Melville the author, not Melville the human being."
00:05:15.815,00:05:18.234,But you just referred to Melville the human being.
00:05:18.318,00:05:20.320,His personal letters to Hawthorne?
00:05:21.904,00:05:30.997,"I was only making the point that his, uh, his friendship with Hawthorne was, uh, was an important aspect of his growth as a writer."
00:05:33.541,00:05:41.090,It was not until the 1920s that the novel took its rightful place as the-- We'll cover the wife-beating in my section.
00:05:41.174,00:05:47.096,"That, as well as some important contributions to Melville's work by the women in his life."
00:05:54.604,00:05:55.772,Who told you that?
00:05:56.606,00:05:59.150,Indefinitely just means until further notice.
00:06:09.369,00:06:12.246,You wanna help me put these flyers up in here and around campus?
00:06:13.039,00:06:15.750,I could send an email to the class through Blackboard.
00:06:15.833,00:06:18.419,It's gone way beyond just the students in our class.
00:06:30.598,00:06:31.933,Your boy's toast.
00:06:43.528,00:06:46.614,-You tried tech support? -I've already left 700 messages.
00:06:46.697,00:06:48.533,I'm on my way over there right now.
00:06:49.075,00:06:50.910,Do you wanna come? Pull your weight?
00:06:50.993,00:06:54.872,I gotta go nudge Rentz. But I will bring it up to Larson tonight.
00:06:54.956,00:07:00.086,"I'm… I'm so sorry, Joan, I… You know what? You wanna work here? I can move some of this crap."
00:07:00.169,00:07:01.170,Nah.
00:07:05.967,00:07:07.135,Yes.
00:07:07.218,00:07:08.678,And what did they say?
00:07:15.643,00:07:19.397,"-Wait a minute. Was he always in here? -Oh, I haven't had time to redecorate."
00:07:19.480,00:07:25.111,I gave him a hand job in his car when I got tenure. To celebrate.
00:07:25.194,00:07:27.864,"That's the president of the college from, like, 1924."
00:07:27.947,00:07:30.074,Who looks like the guy I gave a hand job to.
00:07:34.287,00:07:36.539,"He owes me an orgasm, whoever he is."
00:07:37.123,00:07:40.960,"Hey, Joan? You hear about Bill doing a town hall with the students?"
00:07:42.545,00:07:45.882,-I'm worried. -This is what he does. They love him.
00:07:45.965,00:07:47.550,He's so empathic.
00:07:47.633,00:07:51.471,"Now, if it were Elliot, or even you, I'd be worried."
00:07:56.225,00:07:57.351,"Oh, hey."
00:07:57.894,00:07:58.978,Hi.
00:08:00.062,00:08:01.898,"Uh, thanks for the apple pie."
00:08:02.982,00:08:03.900,Peach.
00:08:06.068,00:08:08.404,"-Uh, do you have a minute? -Sure. Sure."
00:08:09.405,00:08:13.409,"-Oh. Hey, we need to keep that open. -This is going to be a bloodbath."
00:08:14.368,00:08:15.453,Why do you say that?
00:08:16.287,00:08:21.209,"See, any so-called jokes related to Hitler are in their own special category."
00:08:22.043,00:08:25.421,You know some kids put on Hitler mustaches and posted knockoffs of your meme?
00:08:26.088,00:08:29.091,Do you not see this? There's a larger campus context here.
00:08:29.175,00:08:32.470,There's a larger national context. To be Jewish with all these militias?
00:08:32.553,00:08:35.431,"Last year, we had the largest number of anti-Semitic incidents in 40 years."
00:08:40.728,00:08:42.730,"-Uh, this is Daphne. Dr. Kim-- -Dafna."
00:08:43.439,00:08:46.150,"Hi. I was just, um, telling him the same thing."
00:08:54.492,00:08:56.369,-Do you need me for something? -Yes.
00:08:57.662,00:08:58.579,Okay.
00:08:59.914,00:09:04.168,"Uh, there's something else I wanted to ask you about, but to be continued."
00:09:04.252,00:09:05.378,Sure.
00:09:09.840,00:09:11.842,-Okay-- -What the fuck are you doing?
00:09:11.926,00:09:13.886,She came barreling in here and she closed the door.
00:09:13.970,00:09:15.096,Why didn't you open it?
00:09:15.179,00:09:19.392,"Because she was accusing me of inciting the alt-right, and I didn't wanna interrupt her in the middle of that."
00:09:20.184,00:09:21.435,"Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:09:21.519,00:09:23.229,"-Hey, hey, hey. -No. What?"
00:09:24.397,00:09:25.731,"That's nothing, okay?"
00:09:27.858,00:09:28.859,You're trouble.
00:09:29.694,00:09:30.695,Me?
00:09:32.572,00:09:33.864,Can I ask you a favor?
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.992,"After your performance this morning, you owe me one."
00:09:36.075,00:09:36.909,Anything.
00:09:36.993,00:09:39.662,Can you babysit Ju Ju tonight? I've got this thing at Dean Larson's.
00:09:39.745,00:09:40.705,For what?
00:09:40.788,00:09:42.665,"Oh, who knows? Grease the wheels."
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.889,The Wi-Fi in my office is on the fritz.
00:10:01.350,00:10:04.979,"Well, I could get you a booster, but your department will have to fill out the paperwork."
00:10:06.022,00:10:07.273,Have you talked to your chair?
00:10:09.567,00:10:10.568,Okay.
00:10:29.128,00:10:31.797,Thank you.
00:10:44.185,00:10:51.484,Uh… Oh. Uh… Sh-- Oh. Ah!
00:10:55.821,00:10:57.031,Oh my God.
00:11:12.421,00:11:13.964,I heard your internet is down.
00:11:14.548,00:11:16.842,Wonderful. Come in.
00:11:19.261,00:11:21.138,Where have you been all my life?
00:11:21.222,00:11:22.640,"I don't know, IT department?"
00:11:22.723,00:11:26.602,"Actually, have you ever heard of RateMyProfessors.com?"
00:11:26.686,00:11:27.687,Yeah. Mmm.
00:11:27.770,00:11:31.023,I'm supposed to take in some of my students' criticisms.
00:11:31.107,00:11:33.401,-Why? -I already know what they're gonna say.
00:11:33.484,00:11:36.862,That I shouldn't teach any books that are more than 300 pages long.
00:11:36.946,00:11:39.115,"Well, I wouldn't just assume they're gonna say that."
00:11:44.995,00:11:46.789,This font is so small.
00:11:46.872,00:11:49.709,Would you mind reading some of these out loud to me?
00:11:49.792,00:11:54.422,"-The ones that you think might be helpful. -Okay. Yeah, let's, uh, let's see."
00:11:55.464,00:11:56.757,You sure this is legit?
00:11:58.426,00:12:00.261,"-No, not that one. -What?"
00:12:00.344,00:12:10.187,"Oh. Uh… Uh… All dumpty, no humpty."
00:12:10.271,00:12:13.733,"What, like I'm fat? Or do those words mean something different now?"
00:12:13.816,00:12:14.984,"No, that's what they mean."
00:12:15.067,00:12:17.445,"But clearly you're not. Look at you, you look great."
00:12:17.528,00:12:18.696,"Go to the next one, okay?"
00:12:18.779,00:12:28.247,"Professor Hambling's what I think about when I'm trying not to, um… -I don't think this is constructive. -Come on."
00:12:28.330,00:12:30.332,When I'm trying not to cum in my girlfriend.
00:12:30.416,00:12:33.836,I'm what he thinks about when he's trying not to cum in his girlfriend?
00:12:33.919,00:12:35.755,-I don't get it. -I wouldn't overanalyze it.
00:12:35.838,00:12:41.093,I'm what he th… Ah.
00:12:44.722,00:12:46.974,Let's just have a little look at that.
00:12:52.730,00:12:55.357,"-This was posted yesterday. -Oh, was it? I didn't notice that."
00:12:55.441,00:12:59.987,I don't suppose there's any way you could track this fucker down?
00:13:06.535,00:13:08.162,-'Night. -'Night.
00:13:08.245,00:13:12.458,"Oh, um, did you take a look at Yaz's suggestions for external reviewers?"
00:13:13.209,00:13:17.671,"We have to have people who take feminist scholarship and critical race theory seriously, Elliot."
00:13:22.176,00:13:28.891,"You share a mutual interest, obviously, in making sure your field remains one of the most prominent in our department, right?"
00:13:30.392,00:13:33.395,"Anyway, we want her case to go through with flying colors."
00:13:33.479,00:13:38.025,I'll send her work out to respected scholars who will review it objectively.
00:13:39.652,00:13:40.653,Great.
00:13:44.907,00:13:49.745,"elected their first female chair, I did cartwheels."
00:13:49.829,00:14:02.550,"I was an English major, so I told Paul I have to shake her hand, and… I don't know how competitive the election was, but thank you."
00:14:04.760,00:14:08.138,No woman ever got anywhere by underselling herself.
00:14:08.848,00:14:13.227,"Now, I have been thinking about this clusterfuck."
00:14:13.310,00:14:17.940,Oh. Professor Dobson. I can assure you he is going to apologize.
00:14:20.109,00:14:25.155,You all need a pick-me-up over there. Some new blood. Some star power.
00:14:25.239,00:14:30.327,-Mrs. Whittenden has a special visitor-- -I happened to run into such a person-- -You go. -No.
00:14:33.205,00:14:35.416,"At the farmers market, if you can believe it."
00:14:35.499,00:14:38.002,-He has a country house around here. -Mmm.
00:14:38.085,00:14:46.051,"We started talking, and I thought, Here's the kind of person who can revitalize the study of literature."
00:14:46.135,00:14:52.266,"And lo and behold, he agreed to give the Distinguished Lecture this year."
00:14:52.349,00:14:53.350,Mmm.
00:14:53.976,00:14:58.480,"I thought that, um… Historically, that's been at the chair's discretion."
00:14:58.564,00:15:02.526,The funds are at the discretion of the trustee who endowed them.
00:15:02.610,00:15:05.863,"And you can't beat my candidate, Dr. Kim."
00:15:05.946,00:15:10.284,I already announced that Dr. McKay would be-- -Guess who it is. -I don't-- I really can't.
00:15:10.367,00:15:11.827,You'll be thrilled.
00:15:13.245,00:15:15.581,That's a clue right there.
00:15:20.002,00:15:21.795,-Colson Whitehead. -Try again.
00:15:22.421,00:15:24.757,-It's someone you'll like. -I like Colson Whitehead.
00:15:24.840,00:15:26.216,David Duchovny.
00:15:27.259,00:15:28.177,The actor?
00:15:28.260,00:15:30.137,-Agent Scully himself. -Mulder.
00:15:30.220,00:15:37.853,"Mulder. Yeah. He'll, uh… Well, he'll need to prepare his lecture and, uh, have meetings with selected English majors."
00:15:37.937,00:15:40.481,We're planning to choose names by lottery.
00:15:40.564,00:15:44.318,And so we're gonna need you to find him an office.
00:15:56.956,00:15:59.208,"Uh, it's a mixed bag."
00:16:02.753,00:16:06.632,I saw you crying… when your wife died.
00:16:07.549,00:16:10.803,"In the kitchen, and my mom was crying."
00:16:12.596,00:16:13.597,Yeah.
00:16:14.556,00:16:17.559,"-Well, you know, that was a… That was-- -I don't have a dad."
00:16:21.689,00:16:30.155,"Well, one of the things about life is you real-- You don't really realize what, you know, until you're a lot older-- Do you have cavities?"
00:16:32.408,00:16:33.409,Yeah.
00:16:43.085,00:16:45.212,-I sure do. -It has naked pictures in it.
00:16:52.553,00:16:54.638,I don't remember being a baby.
00:17:09.236,00:17:11.363,I don't remember my birth mom.
00:17:21.123,00:17:25.961,"When I have a baby, I'm gonna be 25."
00:17:26.045,00:17:28.088,Maybe 27.
00:17:28.756,00:17:30.340,I don't wanna be really old.
00:17:30.424,00:17:32.426,And I'm gonna be married.
00:17:34.094,00:17:37.014,A lot of people think marriage is a bourgeois institution.
00:17:37.097,00:17:39.933,-You know what that is? -My mom is turning 47.
00:17:41.727,00:17:45.647,"Yeah, well, she had to wait a long time to get you."
00:17:46.899,00:17:51.320,"For two years, she had your car seat by the door, a whole set of clothes ready to go."
00:17:52.696,00:17:58.327,"She was waiting and waiting, and, you know, she had to jump through a lot of hoops."
00:17:58.410,00:18:03.082,"Today, my teacher said that I'm going to lead the class for Día de los Muertos."
00:18:03.165,00:18:05.167,-You know what that is? -Yeah.
00:18:06.210,00:18:07.836,"Mmm, that's exciting."
00:18:08.545,00:18:12.508,So we can make your wife an altar so her soul can find you.
00:18:13.425,00:18:15.969,I just need to know what her favorite things were.
00:18:18.138,00:18:20.224,"Well, she was really good at piano."
00:18:21.183,00:18:28.482,"And, like, what were her favorite things to eat? Like cake, candy… It's good if it's something she can smell."
00:18:31.235,00:18:34.905,"Um, she really liked pizza."
00:18:35.572,00:18:36.573,Same.
00:18:37.699,00:18:40.119,We're about to see another penis.
00:18:41.286,00:18:43.789,-I tried to warn you-- -You can't just pretend he's an academic.
00:18:43.872,00:18:45.165,He almost got his PhD.
00:18:45.249,00:18:47.292,That's another way of saying he doesn't have his PhD.
00:18:47.376,00:18:50.504,I have real faculty with real credentials who need support.
00:18:50.587,00:18:53.632,Who cannot do their work. Who are literally sitting in basements.
00:18:53.715,00:18:56.468,"-He is a recognizable name. -No, he is not."
00:18:56.552,00:18:58.512,These kids don't watch TV. They're on TikTok.
00:18:58.595,00:19:00.097,Butts in seats.
00:19:00.180,00:19:02.391,That's the only thing that should matter to you right now.
00:19:02.474,00:19:03.517,Creative writing?
00:19:03.600,00:19:06.812,That's the only field in your department building enrollments.
00:19:06.895,00:19:08.856,Students want to produce content.
00:19:10.649,00:19:13.735,"Whether it's a novel to self-publish, or… or a blog."
00:19:13.819,00:19:15.654,-Or-- -Then at least get a real writer.
00:19:16.613,00:19:18.991,He is a New York Times bestselling author.
00:19:20.826,00:19:22.452,"-No, he's not. -Look it up."
00:19:24.037,00:19:25.038,No.
00:19:31.753,00:19:32.754,Hello?
00:19:50.105,00:19:51.857,You did all my dishes.
00:19:56.069,00:19:57.112,Thanks.
00:19:59.698,00:20:03.535,"Can I, um… -Can I try it out on you? -Yeah."
00:20:04.745,00:20:05.996,Thank you for coming.
00:20:07.998,00:20:12.294,I'm truly heartbroken to have offended anyone here.
00:20:13.003,00:20:24.306,The fact is… Bill.
00:20:25.807,00:20:27.309,You know what? I give up.
00:20:27.976,00:20:31.563,Sorry. I'm just-- Okay.
00:20:33.357,00:20:34.358,There's this.
00:20:35.025,00:20:36.985,David Duchovny is a bestselling author.
00:20:37.069,00:20:38.820,-No. -Mm-hmm.
00:20:38.904,00:20:40.864,Still can't let him give the Distinguished Lecture.
00:20:40.948,00:20:42.115,I don't have a choice.
00:20:43.075,00:20:46.370,David Duchovny wrote his thesis at Princeton on Beckett.
00:20:46.453,00:20:47.537,"Oh, just like you."
00:20:48.580,00:20:49.623,No.
00:20:49.706,00:20:52.834,He was Harold Bloom's advisee at Yale.
00:20:52.918,00:20:54.253,-Jesus. -I know.
00:20:55.045,00:20:58.340,"Oh, wait, wait. Go back. Is that really David Duchovny's butt?"
00:20:58.423,00:21:01.343,Why do we keep saying David Duchovny's whole name every time we mention him?
00:21:01.426,00:21:03.637,-Is that really David's butt? -Okay.
00:21:03.720,00:21:05.138,-He is in shape. -That's enough.
00:21:15.399,00:21:16.233,Why?
00:21:16.316,00:21:18.819,There's students waiting to hear from Bill Dobson. The town hall.
00:21:18.902,00:21:21.238,Oh Jesus Christ. That's in the main quad? Right now?
00:21:22.906,00:21:25.117,Just start setting up when they disperse.
00:21:25.200,00:21:26.660,Get the campus police there.
00:21:26.743,00:21:29.579,Keep the quad clear for the rest of the afternoon.
00:21:34.626,00:21:40.674,"Obviously, I am not a member of the Jewish community, and I'm not in a position to tell you what is or isn't offensive."
00:21:42.592,00:21:48.390,"But I am a member of the Pembroke community, as are we all, and I wanna understand your point of view."
00:21:48.473,00:21:49.766,-No Nazis at Pembroke. -Yeah.
00:21:49.850,00:21:52.060,I agree. There should be no Nazis anywhere.
00:21:52.144,00:21:53.854,-Hate speech has no place here. -Agreed.
00:21:53.937,00:21:55.856,Are you harboring neo-Nazi sentiments?
00:21:58.483,00:22:01.945,"Uh, Nazis hate professors, because Nazis are enemies of thought."
00:22:02.029,00:22:07.826,One of the greatest gifts that American universities ever received was the influx of intellectuals who fled the Third Reich.
00:22:07.909,00:22:13.123,"Writers like Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt, Bertolt Brecht, Theodor Adorno."
00:22:13.206,00:22:15.917,Many of them wrote invaluable studies of the fascist mindset.
00:22:16.001,00:22:18.670,Invaluable defenses of freedom of thought.
00:22:18.754,00:22:22.382,"I wouldn't use the stories of Jewish refugees here, if I were you."
00:22:25.052,00:22:27.137,Some of them were standing in solidarity.
00:22:27.220,00:22:28.764,You comparing yourself to Hannah Arendt?
00:22:28.847,00:22:30.474,-No. -After saluting Hitler in your class.
00:22:30.557,00:22:31.516,Let's hear him out.
00:22:31.600,00:22:34.770,We are inheritors of their legacy.
00:22:34.853,00:22:37.856,The university should be a place to uphold free discourse.
00:22:37.939,00:22:40.275,The exchange of ideas without fear.
00:22:40.359,00:22:42.903,It's all about free speech as long as you're the one talking.
00:22:44.613,00:22:48.033,"No, I want this to be a forum where everyone can voice their opinion."
00:22:48.116,00:22:51.078,You're a white tenured professor who writes op-eds for the New York Times.
00:22:54.164,00:22:57.459,"I get that. That's a great point, and it's never gonna be perfect."
00:22:57.542,00:23:00.253,-But having this conversation is a start. -Yeah.
00:23:00.337,00:23:02.756,Someone drew a swastika in Brooks Hall yesterday.
00:23:11.348,00:23:18.063,"If you are suggesting that what I did is the same as propagating neo-Nazism, that's inaccurate."
00:23:18.146,00:23:24.778,That is a willful misrecognition of what was clearly-- Are you saying we misrecognized a Nazi salute?
00:23:24.861,00:23:35.288,"No. I'm not… I'm not saying that at all. I was trying to say-- This is how it always goes. You do something that's objectively fucked up, and then when we call you out on it, we get accused of getting it wrong."
00:23:36.415,00:23:40.794,I didn't say anyone was overreacting. I was making the case-- Are you going to apologize?
00:23:43.922,00:23:44.756,Yes.
00:23:51.430,00:23:59.062,I am sorry if I made anyone feel-- -If I made you feel-- -You're sorry about my feelings.
00:23:59.146,00:24:03.024,You're minimizing your responsibility by saying you're sorry for how we feel.
00:24:03.108,00:24:04.109,"Hey, Dean Larson."
00:24:04.192,00:24:08.697,It's nice to see you come out to defend a member of Pembroke faculty for saluting Hitler!
00:24:10.907,00:24:13.785,I didn't ask him to be here. This is between you and me.
00:24:16.496,00:24:20.917,We hosted a town hall on racial justice literally right here.
00:24:23.253,00:24:25.714,-You brought backup. -I can't believe you brought them.
00:24:25.797,00:24:29.134,-Please. These are two separate issues. -No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:24:37.476,00:24:41.771,Dobson out! Dobson out! Dobson out!
00:00:27.277,00:00:28.611,Temporary suspension.
00:00:32.949,00:00:35.493,-You're not allowed on campus. -What?
00:00:35.577,00:00:40.373,"They had to give something to the students, especially after the altercation with campus police."
00:00:40.457,00:00:43.710,Larson asked them to clear the quad for a fucking donor event.
00:00:48.798,00:00:52.677,That's completely unfair. That's on him. Did you make that clear?
00:00:52.761,00:00:57.057,-Did you defend me? -You don't-- Do you know what I've been dealing with?
00:00:57.140,00:01:02.479,Students coming and crying and… This isn't what I wanna be dealing with as chair.
00:01:04.689,00:01:06.733,You're going to need to formally apologize.
00:01:06.816,00:01:09.527,"I'm so sorry. I-- No, not to me, dumbass!"
00:01:09.611,00:01:16.242,"I mean yes, to me, but they're putting together a disciplinary hearing, and you have to write an apology that can be disseminated."
00:01:18.495,00:01:24.626,Jesus. What is-- Hello.
00:01:24.709,00:01:25.710,"Yes, this is she."
00:01:27.754,00:01:29.923,"Wait, hit or bit?"
00:01:34.844,00:01:36.221,You're both suspended.
00:01:37.472,00:01:40.141,"I'm going to work, and you are going to write letters."
00:01:43.311,00:01:47.023,"Bill, you will apologize… to everyone."
00:01:52.904,00:01:57.784,"For next time, everyone needs to come having finished The Pardoner's Tale."
00:01:58.284,00:02:00.703,No pardons for slackers.
00:02:03.998,00:02:04.833,Oh hi.
00:02:05.416,00:02:07.544,I was able to do that thing we talked about.
00:02:07.627,00:02:11.422,I didn't think you were really-- I was joking.
00:02:11.506,00:02:14.259,I thought you were pretending to joke but were actually serious.
00:02:21.975,00:02:25.186,Not exactly. But I was able to hack into the Rate My Professor website.
00:02:25.270,00:02:32.193,"Hack? No, I can't even be tangentially connected to anything that might seem improper conduct or illegal."
00:02:32.277,00:02:33.778,-But you wanna know who it is? -Yes.
00:02:33.862,00:02:34.696,Okay.
00:02:35.488,00:02:40.076,"It was posted twice from the Humanities Library, both times between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m."
00:02:40.160,00:02:41.703,EffThisClass223?
00:02:41.786,00:02:43.705,"No, EatMeChaucer@gmail.com."
00:02:44.706,00:02:51.004,"If he posts again, and, say, we were at the library… Yeah. I mean, you'd have to recognize the guy."
00:02:53.047,00:02:55.425,What are you gonna do if you catch him?
00:02:55.508,00:03:01.514,"Destroy him, Joan said jokingly, when that's exactly what she was planning to do."
00:03:06.102,00:03:08.771,"Hi, I'm Charlotte Lo from The Pembroke Daily."
00:03:08.855,00:03:11.941,-I left you a few messages. -Right. Hi.
00:03:12.025,00:03:14.944,"Uh, I… I don't wanna comment on the whole thing, okay?"
00:03:15.028,00:03:18.156,"Well, where do you stand? Are you joining the protest tomorrow?"
00:03:18.907,00:03:21.618,I think people would appreciate hearing your point of view.
00:03:22.118,00:03:23.036,Sorry.
00:03:23.119,00:03:26.372,What made you pursue Bill Dobson as a mentor in the first place?
00:03:26.456,00:03:28.750,"I… I can't answer, okay?"
00:03:29.292,00:03:33.296,The chair of my department gave me an earful about not talking to anyone about this.
00:03:47.936,00:03:50.939,"-I guess I'm making you some eggs, then. -I don't eat eggs."
00:03:52.565,00:03:54.776,"Because you don't like 'em, or you never tried 'em?"
00:03:55.360,00:03:56.319,Both.
00:04:04.953,00:04:07.080,I'll give you a dollar if you try a bite.
00:04:08.498,00:04:10.750,Name one thing you can buy with a dollar.
00:04:12.377,00:04:13.294,Raisins?
00:04:16.339,00:04:18.258,"Uh, Professor Kim, you got a sec?"
00:04:18.341,00:04:20.260,"Sure thing. Come in, Dustin."
00:04:20.885,00:04:22.053,"Oh, hi, Capri."
00:04:22.637,00:04:23.471,Take a seat.
00:04:23.554,00:04:24.472,We're okay.
00:04:25.056,00:04:25.890,What's up?
00:04:25.974,00:04:29.769,Poli Sci just denied tenure to the only person of color in their department.
00:04:29.852,00:04:31.437,We're worried about Professor McKay.
00:04:31.521,00:04:32.689,They're conservative assholes.
00:04:32.772,00:04:35.024,Black faculty are held to different standards.
00:04:35.108,00:04:37.610,-I know. -Their research isn't considered rigorous.
00:04:37.694,00:04:40.780,"They're assumed to be more disorganized, less collegial."
00:04:40.863,00:04:41.739,I know.
00:04:41.823,00:04:44.534,They get invited less often to their colleagues' houses for dinner.
00:04:46.661,00:04:47.662,I know.
00:04:48.538,00:04:50.373,"Trust me, I know."
00:04:51.040,00:04:55.295,This is a letter signed by 320 students about the impact Professor McKay has had.
00:04:55.378,00:04:58.381,The way she's supported students of color.
00:05:00.842,00:05:04.429,"If she is denied tenure, we plan to take action."
00:05:13.271,00:05:15.023,but look what they did to the sleeves.
00:05:15.106,00:05:17.900,"I mean, this isn't bell-shaped, this is oblong."
00:05:17.984,00:05:19.235,This is a master's gown.
00:05:19.319,00:05:20.987,Everyone knows you have a doctorate.
00:05:21.070,00:05:24.782,Would you like me to see if Laurie can look into ordering you a new one?
00:05:24.866,00:05:28.077,"-How much is that gonna run me? -Oh, on the house."
00:05:28.161,00:05:29.203,Really?
00:05:29.287,00:05:30.955,"-Our secret. -Well, thanks, kiddo."
00:05:32.040,00:05:36.919,"Um, your tenure letter for Yaz is going to include material on her teaching, right?"
00:05:37.003,00:05:37.837,Why wouldn't it?
00:05:37.920,00:05:41.632,I think it's important that you highlight how innovative her pedagogy is.
00:05:41.716,00:05:46.596,"The flipped classroom-- Well, I believe a specimen of that will be on display in today's seminar."
00:05:46.679,00:05:48.681,Could you maybe include a mention of it?
00:05:50.183,00:05:52.685,"Look, she is hot shit right now."
00:05:52.769,00:05:56.731,"She has over 8,000 followers on Twitter. That's more than all of us put together."
00:05:56.814,00:05:59.484,You know who judged himself by the number of his followers?
00:05:59.567,00:06:02.570,"-Jim Jones. David Koresh. -Yaz isn't a cult leader, Elliot."
00:06:02.653,00:06:06.199,Jesus only had 12 followers. I suppose that makes him a loser.
00:06:10.703,00:06:17.126,"Because of her, our students are excited about literature that was written 150 years ago."
00:06:17.210,00:06:20.671,I know in your heyday-- How do you know right now is not my heyday?
00:06:25.593,00:06:30.598,"Look, I don't want to pull rank here, but as the chair, I need you to do this."
00:06:30.681,00:06:33.351,-You sure settled into that role. -Not saying this as your supervisor.
00:06:33.434,00:06:36.062,-Supervisor? -It's the best thing for the department.
00:06:36.145,00:06:38.606,"And the right thing to do for Yaz, so just do it."
00:06:50.410,00:06:52.370,You still got a top-notch rear end.
00:06:52.453,00:06:54.372,Wish I could say the same for you.
00:06:54.872,00:06:56.916,What does the whale represent?
00:07:01.754,00:07:03.631,-White supremacy. -Oh-ho!
00:07:08.094,00:07:18.479,"All the morning long, I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me."
00:08:08.779,00:08:13.534,"I am sorry I made you think I like Hitler, because I do not."
00:08:14.035,00:08:17.163,I know he is the worst person who ever lived.
00:08:22.084,00:08:26.005,"Dear Adin, I want you to know how sorry I am for biting you."
00:08:26.088,00:08:29.342,"I understand that biting is never allowed, even if the person asks."
00:08:29.425,00:08:32.595,"You are my friend, and we used to like playing together at recess."
00:08:32.678,00:08:33.721,That's a lie.
00:08:35.515,00:08:36.516,Put Ju Ju.
00:08:37.642,00:08:38.643,I like Ju-Hee.
00:08:39.310,00:08:41.646,"It was your grandmother's name. You know that, right?"
00:08:41.729,00:08:43.606,I don't like it!
00:08:45.733,00:08:48.027,"Well, I… I think it's beautiful."
00:08:48.945,00:08:51.906,Your mom named you after her mom. That's pretty cool.
00:08:51.989,00:08:53.032,Pretty big honor.
00:08:53.115,00:08:57.078,"It's a way of keeping her mom alive, through you."
00:09:00.164,00:09:02.124,You know what posterity is?
00:09:06.879,00:09:11.467,"That is posterior, and it's very close."
00:09:16.138,00:09:17.557,Whittenden picked this.
00:09:18.558,00:09:20.726,"Apparently, we're hiring him to sell cognac?"
00:09:20.810,00:09:26.941,Mmm. And she thought that you should get started right away.
00:09:30.653,00:09:33.114,quite another to actually expect me to read these.
00:09:33.573,00:09:36.826,And David has graciously agreed to take over Bill's class.
00:09:36.909,00:09:37.743,What?
00:09:37.827,00:09:40.413,"Just until the hearing, and then we'll see what happens."
00:09:40.496,00:09:44.125,He's writing an apology. This is all going to resolve itself.
00:09:44.208,00:09:46.043,"David will need Bill's syllabus, lecture notes."
00:09:46.127,00:09:47.086,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:09:47.169,00:09:50.464,He specifically asked for them so he could pick up where Bill left off.
00:09:50.548,00:09:52.049,Minus the Sieg Heil.
00:09:52.133,00:09:54.093,Bill's not just gonna hand over his notes.
00:09:54.176,00:09:58.347,"When you were on maternity leave, you passed on your class-- -That is different. -How?"
00:09:59.223,00:10:01.559,David is willing to pinch hit for Bill.
00:10:01.642,00:10:03.936,He should be grateful that he wants to do the class justice.
00:10:04.020,00:10:06.606,-Bill's not gonna see it that way. -Bill was a popular teacher.
00:10:06.689,00:10:08.566,"-But we need to be- -Wait, was?"
00:10:09.734,00:10:11.485,Can I give you a piece of advice?
00:10:15.865,00:10:18.534,You are chair of the department now.
00:10:19.535,00:10:20.703,You're not a peer.
00:10:22.413,00:10:23.789,Do you get what I'm saying?
00:10:24.540,00:10:26.292,You are not Bill's peer.
00:10:28.210,00:10:29.837,What time you want me back tomorrow?
00:10:32.256,00:10:35.885,"Oh no, that's okay. I probably should, you know, find a real babysitter."
00:10:35.968,00:10:37.511,"Oh, come on, let me do it."
00:10:37.595,00:10:41.515,"Being with her makes me, um… I don't have to miss teaching."
00:10:42.099,00:10:44.685,I was gonna give her my Beckett and suicide lecture.
00:10:49.899,00:10:51.150,This is called food.
00:10:59.742,00:11:02.620,"-Your mom came home. I wanted her to eat. -Hi, little one."
00:11:07.875,00:11:10.920,"-Um, don't you want your mom to-- -Uh, no, go ahead."
00:11:11.754,00:11:13.172,You sure? Okay.
00:11:18.469,00:11:20.096,I thought you were asleep.
00:11:21.806,00:11:23.683,Can you finish the story?
00:11:30.398,00:11:33.484,She doesn't wanna teach them. She wants to hang out with them.
00:11:34.902,00:11:42.118,"Though she's publishing in all the highest venues, but-- They turned you down for tenure, and you were the best we had."
00:11:42.201,00:11:45.705,Because I was expected to write a book when I was busy raising three kids.
00:11:47.957,00:11:49.875,I should've put more pressure on them.
00:11:51.877,00:11:53.379,Someone had to make dinner.
00:11:53.879,00:11:54.880,Yeah.
00:11:58.426,00:12:00.469,-I told you I'm not wearing those. -Just tonight.
00:12:00.553,00:12:01.971,I'm not wearing diapers.
00:12:02.930,00:12:04.974,"This doesn't spell doom, old man."
00:12:06.726,00:12:10.062,I used to bestride the narrow world like a Colossus.
00:13:08.996,00:13:10.581,-Echo. -Echo.
00:13:21.926,00:13:25.513,Do you know what it means to lampoon somebody?
00:13:26.388,00:13:35.064,"Posada was making fun of Mexican leader Porfirio Díaz because even though Díaz modernized Mexico, his reforms really only benefited the ruling class."
00:13:35.147,00:13:36.315,I wanna lampoon you.
00:13:38.067,00:13:39.276,I don't think so.
00:13:39.360,00:13:42.279,"My name's Bill, and I'm so boring."
00:13:49.453,00:13:53.749,"Ju Ju, you're the cultural ambassador of Día de los Muertos."
00:13:53.833,00:13:56.335,"If we don't work on your presentation, you're gonna be sorry."
00:13:56.418,00:13:58.087,When's recess?
00:14:23.153,00:14:24.363,It's me.
00:14:24.446,00:14:26.115,"Yeah, I know."
00:14:29.285,00:14:32.079,"Now we just, um, wait for a post."
00:14:32.162,00:14:33.163,Mm-hmm.
00:14:39.461,00:14:40.880,You're reading Chaucer?
00:14:40.963,00:14:44.133,"Yeah. It's like reading a different language, though, you know."
00:14:44.216,00:14:46.760,You'll be surprised how fast you get used to it.
00:14:55.019,00:14:55.895,-It's him. -Already?
00:14:56.687,00:14:57.855,-It's him? -Yeah.
00:15:05.112,00:15:07.865,"Let me, uh, check the IP address."
00:15:08.365,00:15:11.076,He's here. He's here. Okay.
00:15:12.745,00:15:15.289,"All right, what should we… do?"
00:15:15.372,00:15:16.582,"Oh, okay."
00:15:38.145,00:15:40.189,-You want a hand? -Be my guest.
00:15:44.818,00:15:45.778,Okay.
00:15:49.615,00:15:51.492,Brilliant. Thank you.
00:15:51.575,00:15:52.576,Yeah.
00:15:53.494,00:15:56.872,"When Melville died, the Times just published a tiny death notice?"
00:15:56.956,00:15:59.333,They actually misspelled the title of Moby-Dick.
00:15:59.875,00:16:01.377,-M-O-B-I-E. -I-E.
00:16:01.961,00:16:04.588,"-It upsets me. -Well, that makes two of us."
00:16:06.966,00:16:08.258,-Thanks. -Yeah.
00:16:13.180,00:16:24.358,"Oh, hey, you forgot your, uh-- This is a water balloon."
00:16:24.441,00:16:28.320,"In order to explore air resistance and physics, what you do is you catch it."
00:16:28.404,00:16:36.203,"Oh, good catch! That was perfect! That was so awes- You li-- That's it!"
00:16:42.167,00:16:43.919,I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!
00:16:47.464,00:16:49.091,"Ju Ju, come on, come back."
00:17:00.185,00:17:01.228,What the fuck?
00:17:01.311,00:17:03.772,No sleeping in the library. It's a new rule.
00:17:03.856,00:17:04.898,Oh okay.
00:17:11.280,00:17:12.114,Hey.
00:17:18.037,00:17:19.038,"Hey, you!"
00:17:19.538,00:17:20.372,Is that him?
00:17:21.498,00:17:23.709,Wait! Goddamn it.
00:17:34.219,00:17:36.972,-Steve. -Professor Hambling?
00:17:37.765,00:17:39.558,Now you listen to me.
00:17:40.392,00:17:44.605,"I may not be your cup of tea, but The Canterbury Tales is a work of genius."
00:17:44.688,00:17:49.943,"Philandering husbands, horny housewives, farting, shitting, pubic hair."
00:17:54.698,00:17:56.658,That's a fate I'm wishing for you.
00:17:56.742,00:17:58.619,"-Okay, okay. -So, you know, pucker up."
00:18:01.997,00:18:06.251,But Chaucer has survived more than 600 years of literary criticism.
00:18:06.335,00:18:12.883,"And if you can't figure out that he's a badass, then just stay the fuck out of my classroom."
00:18:18.597,00:18:20.474,What are you teaching next semester?
00:18:30.984,00:18:32.319,I'll ask him to pull back.
00:18:35.364,00:18:36.448,It's just a draft.
00:18:36.532,00:18:38.784,He was making photocopies on letterhead.
00:18:44.206,00:18:45.332,What?
00:18:45.415,00:18:47.876,"You have tenure, I don't."
00:18:47.960,00:18:53.507,"Now you're the chair too. I-- I don't know, I'm not sure what's okay to say and what's not okay."
00:18:53.590,00:19:02.808,"Yaz, if I haven't made it clear that I want you to speak your mind, then-- Then I… I consider that a serious failure on my part."
00:19:02.891,00:19:04.226,"I mean, that kills me."
00:19:05.769,00:19:06.770,Okay.
00:19:11.066,00:19:12.401,What are you doing?
00:19:12.484,00:19:16.321,How does this align with your mission? I thought we moved beyond this bullshit.
00:19:16.405,00:19:19.366,"I am giving them David Duchovny, so they will give me you."
00:19:19.449,00:19:21.577,You shouldn't be pimping for David Duchovny.
00:19:21.660,00:19:24.621,-I know-- -I shouldn't be asked to stand out-- I am trying.
00:19:26.415,00:19:28.709,I don't feel like I inherited an English Department.
00:19:28.792,00:19:34.298,I feel like someone handed me a ticking time bomb because they wanted to make sure a woman was holding it when it explodes.
00:19:34.381,00:19:36.925,Bill and I started teaching here around the same time.
00:19:37.009,00:19:44.516,"Whenever Elliot would bump into us, he would clap Bill on the back and invite him over for dinner, and I was like, Um, hello?"
00:19:45.225,00:19:49.605,"The bottom line is, he still has a lot of institutional power."
00:19:49.688,00:19:52.774,He's insecure because no one takes his classes anymore.
00:19:52.858,00:19:53.942,Yeah.
00:19:54.026,00:19:56.236,"No, I see why you feel sorry for him."
00:19:57.154,00:19:59.990,He only got to rule the profession for the last 40 years.
00:20:02.951,00:20:12.544,Yaz… Ju Ju?
00:20:12.628,00:20:15.505,Wait. That is technically campus. I cannot be there.
00:20:16.298,00:20:17.925,"No, Ju Ju, please."
00:20:34.983,00:20:37.653,I can't be here! I can't be on campus!
00:20:37.736,00:20:38.862,"Hey, Dobson."
00:20:40.572,00:20:41.740,Don't back down.
00:20:43.116,00:20:44.368,Free speech in America.
00:21:36.712,00:21:38.797,"Oh my God, you scared me. What are you doing here?"
00:21:38.880,00:21:42.259,"-Uh, I gotta-- -You're not supposed to be on campus."
00:21:47.347,00:21:49.099,Those are my lecture notes.
00:21:52.602,00:21:53.937,"Okay, please don't freak out."
00:21:54.021,00:21:56.189,Larson asked David Duchovny to teach your class.
00:21:56.273,00:21:59.026,"-What? -As, like, a… a guest lecturer."
00:21:59.109,00:22:01.862,Just a few classes while we… Just until your hearing.
00:22:01.945,00:22:04.197,So you were gonna take 'em home and then what?
00:22:04.281,00:22:06.074,Invite him over for a… a seminar?
00:22:06.158,00:22:11.830,I'm supposed to go to his house. He has a country house-- Jesus fucking Christ. Is this really happening?
00:22:11.913,00:22:14.207,You're taking my stolen notes to David Duchovny's house?
00:22:14.291,00:22:16.084,No. That's my intellectual property.
00:22:16.168,00:22:20.714,"I am taking your notes because someone has to teach your class, even if that someone is David fucking Duchovny."
00:22:20.797,00:22:31.141,"The larger issue, the one you're trying to blow by, is that you're allowed everywhere except-- -Oh. Ju Ju? -Go."
00:22:39.274,00:22:40.108,Ju Ju!
00:22:42.652,00:22:45.322,"-Look at us. Stop. -Stop moving. No, honey, look at me."
00:22:45.405,00:22:46.615,"I wanna jump, to Bill."
00:22:46.698,00:22:48.575,-Turn to me. -That's not a good idea.
00:22:48.658,00:22:50.160,-One. -Okay.
00:22:50.243,00:22:51.411,"-Okay, okay. -Two."
00:22:51.495,00:22:53.205,-Hold on. Hold on. Oh God! -Three!
00:22:54.998,00:22:56.792,"-You scared your mama. -Okay, let's go."
00:22:56.875,00:22:58.377,-Let's-- -You scared your mama.
00:22:58.460,00:23:00.379,"-Sweetheart, let's go. -Stop it. No."
00:23:00.462,00:23:01.630,-Can Bill come? -No.
00:23:01.713,00:23:03.006,"-Not tonight. -No, we gotta leave."
00:23:03.090,00:23:04.758,"-Come for dinner. -No, sweetheart."
00:23:04.841,00:23:05.926,-Come! -We have got to leave.
00:23:06.009,00:23:07.260,"-Come on! -Okay, to the car."
00:23:07.344,00:23:08.220,-Mom! -To the car?
00:23:08.303,00:23:09.179,-Yes. -To the car?
00:23:16.269,00:23:17.771,"Mommy, you're so short."
00:23:18.688,00:23:19.648,And cute.
00:04:20.218,00:04:21.219,You're early.
00:04:21.302,00:04:27.517,"Yes, we-- When are you coming back?"
00:04:28.476,00:04:30.061,Minji only has a first birthday once.
00:04:30.144,00:04:34.315,Everyone complains how they never see you.
00:04:37.986,00:04:40.822,I thought this promotion means you don't have to work so much.
00:04:50.873,00:04:53.668,How can she do what I tell her when she doesn't speak Korean?
00:05:01.259,00:05:03.344,See you later. I love you.
00:05:07.765,00:05:10.018,"I love you, Ju Ju."
00:05:13.187,00:05:17.734,She's mad at me because she was supposed to work on her Mexico presentation this morning with Bill.
00:05:22.322,00:05:23.573,For homework.
00:11:40.991,00:11:43.411,It's like a Frankenstein family.
00:11:44.078,00:11:46.163,Why didn't she adopt a baby from South Korea?
00:11:47.498,00:11:52.378,You can only adopt from South Korea if you're married.
00:11:53.087,00:11:57.633,She was closed out from international adoption because she's single.
00:11:57.717,00:12:01.637,"Please, Madonna's single and she was able to adopt."
00:12:02.805,00:12:04.765,Angelina Jolie too.
00:14:26.824,00:14:29.159,I think that's Ji-Yoon's boyfriend.
00:14:29.243,00:14:30.244,Peter Seung?
00:14:31.287,00:14:34.415,"No, it's been so long since they broke up."
00:14:34.915,00:14:37.167,He's in Michigan now.
00:14:38.294,00:14:40.629,I'm knitting him this sweater.
00:14:42.506,00:14:44.425,Look at his face. He's a white man.
00:14:49.221,00:14:50.264,"Oh, I see."
00:14:51.849,00:14:55.603,Habi said they picked him up off the street.
00:14:55.686,00:14:59.773,That makes sense. He looks messy.
00:24:35.474,00:24:38.560,How can a grown man live like this?
00:24:38.643,00:24:40.437,He's a widower.
00:24:40.520,00:24:42.522,"I'm a widower, and my house is clean."
00:24:42.606,00:24:44.399,How long ago did he lose his wife?
00:24:44.483,00:24:46.234,It's been about a year.
00:24:46.860,00:24:48.278,He works together with Ji-Yoon?
00:24:48.361,00:24:52.616,"Yes. English professor. And he wrote a book, maybe two?"
00:25:17.766,00:25:20.393,If only there were a good Korean woman in his life.
00:25:20.477,00:25:21.353,What about Ji-Yoon?
00:25:21.436,00:25:25.649,He has a good job. Not bad-looking if he'd only shave.
00:25:25.732,00:25:27.734,And he's good with kids.
00:25:29.319,00:25:32.781,They say he's a drug addict and he drinks.
00:25:33.323,00:25:37.702,You want Ji-Yoon to bring a drug addict alcoholic into her life?
00:25:37.786,00:25:40.664,She's turning 50 soon.
00:25:40.747,00:25:43.875,Maybe this is the last bus in town.
00:00:11.511,00:00:13.763,What? No. Where is this coming from?
00:00:13.847,00:00:17.308,Did you say she could get hurt if she talked to the student newspaper?
00:00:17.392,00:00:18.393,No.
00:00:21.354,00:00:28.528,I… I mentioned that the… the department could get hurt if we-- Pembroke Daily is running an article suggesting you issued a gag order.
00:00:28.611,00:00:29.529,I would never do that.
00:00:29.612,00:00:34.492,Did you have a conversation with Bill's TA in which you asked her not to discuss Bill's incident?
00:00:35.452,00:00:37.871,I can try to kill the story if it's inaccurate.
00:00:37.954,00:00:43.043,I… That is certainly not what I meant to convey.
00:00:43.835,00:00:50.383,"Students are already mobilized, and we're concerned that this is going to exacerbate things on campus."
00:00:50.884,00:00:53.344,We would like you to make some kind of statement.
00:00:53.428,00:00:54.345,Okay.
00:00:54.846,00:00:56.014,"I mean… I mean, yes."
00:00:56.097,00:01:03.605,I've drafted a letter from both you and Dean Larson alerting Professor Dobson that next week's hearing will be on termination for cause.
00:01:03.688,00:01:06.066,It's no longer a disciplinary hearing.
00:01:06.149,00:01:07.609,What about due process?
00:01:07.692,00:01:13.448,"In order to fire a tenured professor, don't you have-- Tenure is not a blank check anymore. Particularly in this climate."
00:01:13.531,00:01:18.369,And we heard about him lecturing hungover and showing nude photos in class.
00:01:18.453,00:01:20.789,"-Or nude videos, I think it was. -Videos."
00:01:20.872,00:01:23.583,-That was-- -Getting rides from female students.
00:01:23.666,00:01:24.876,That happened once.
00:01:24.959,00:01:26.461,-Which one? -All of them.
00:01:27.170,00:01:30.590,-I realize that's not a great defense. -So you knew about him with a coed?
00:01:30.673,00:01:32.717,"I mean, did she complain?"
00:01:32.801,00:01:36.137,"-Really? She shouldn't have to. -No, no, she shouldn't have to."
00:01:37.764,00:01:39.516,His wife died a year ago.
00:01:40.141,00:01:41.351,Are you two involved?
00:01:41.434,00:01:43.269,"If I were a man, would you ask me that?"
00:01:43.353,00:01:45.980,The three of you left campus yesterday in the same car.
00:01:46.064,00:01:47.690,Only because his was in the shop.
00:01:47.774,00:01:53.279,"If you are romantically involved, you need to declare it, or you yourself are in violation of university policy."
00:01:53.363,00:01:56.074,Another option would be for you to step down as chair.
00:01:56.157,00:02:01.704,"My defending Professor Dobson has nothing to do with my feelings for him, which are entirely platonic and professional."
00:02:01.788,00:02:09.796,"I have a responsibility to protect my-- You have a responsibility to this institution, to prevent issues like this from spinning out of control."
00:02:09.879,00:02:11.881,You've managed to do the opposite.
00:02:14.259,00:02:15.677,"Sign here, if you would."
00:02:18.721,00:02:24.853,Call me when you get this. We need to talk. It's urgent. And… it's pretty bad for both of us.
00:02:25.770,00:02:34.028,"Anyway, I have to go to this meeting, and I'm gonna drop something off to you, so just… Please call me immediately when you get this. Call me."
00:02:34.112,00:02:35.280,You better call me.
00:02:45.290,00:02:47.208,-Stay here. -I have to tell him something now.
00:02:47.292,00:02:48.668,I told you it can't happen today.
00:02:48.751,00:02:52.088,I have to tell him something for Día de los Muertos!
00:02:53.256,00:02:55.550,Bill? I have to give you something.
00:02:55.633,00:02:56.509,Bill?
00:03:01.222,00:03:03.433,His wife's soul won't know where to go.
00:03:03.516,00:03:05.310,-She will. -She won't be able to find him.
00:03:05.393,00:03:06.227,"Yes, she will, Ju Ju."
00:03:06.311,00:03:08.605,You don't know anything about Día de los Muertos.
00:03:08.688,00:03:10.815,You don't know anything about my heritage!
00:03:12.400,00:03:13.401,Puta.
00:03:17.363,00:03:21.701,Guess what? The reason you know the word puta is because I'm giving you Spanish lessons.
00:03:21.784,00:03:25.580,And the reason we're going to Oaxaca this summer is because some of your ancestors are from there.
00:03:25.663,00:03:27.457,Ava's going to Disneyland.
00:03:29.083,00:03:30.501,Duly fucking noted.
00:04:24.764,00:04:26.432,Here's her stuff. I'll be back later.
00:04:27.558,00:04:28.393,I'm not sure.
00:04:46.494,00:04:50.790,"Baby, for God's sakes, just be good and do what halahbojee says, okay?"
00:04:56.587,00:04:58.923,And she understands more than you think.
00:04:59.007,00:04:59.924,Here.
00:05:28.703,00:05:30.204,It's a Mexican tradition.
00:05:31.581,00:05:32.498,Never mind.
00:05:40.715,00:05:42.133,"Heads up, Hitler!"
00:06:16.292,00:06:17.293,Hello?
00:06:21.297,00:06:22.340,Mr. Duchovny?
00:06:28.346,00:06:29.347,Hello?
00:06:34.310,00:06:35.311,David?
00:06:37.313,00:06:38.314,Hello?
00:06:47.448,00:06:48.699,What the fuck?
00:06:51.619,00:06:52.745,Hey.
00:06:52.829,00:06:54.414,Hi. Hi.
00:07:01.087,00:07:02.088,Yeah.
00:07:02.755,00:07:06.259,"The, uh… The door was open. Do you always leave your door open?"
00:07:06.342,00:07:07.969,Never had a problem before.
00:07:08.636,00:07:11.514,That's why I love it here. Nobody bothers you.
00:07:17.603,00:07:18.604,Oh my God!
00:07:23.776,00:07:26.946,"Yeah, sorry, I… For a second, I thought you were naked."
00:07:27.029,00:07:28.030,Oh.
00:07:29.490,00:07:30.491,Interesting.
00:07:35.413,00:07:37.582,Bill! Bill! Bill!
00:07:37.665,00:07:40.042,-Hey. -What are you doing?
00:07:40.126,00:07:43.004,Going to McDonald's. What are you guys doing here?
00:07:43.087,00:07:45.339,We're going to Minji's birthday party.
00:07:47.842,00:07:49.552,"Habi, can Bill come?"
00:07:49.635,00:07:50.970,"-No, no. -Please?"
00:07:51.053,00:07:52.597,"Yeah, I'm on a tight schedule."
00:07:58.478,00:07:59.729,Will there be cake?
00:08:04.650,00:08:06.068,You left this at the copier.
00:08:07.987,00:08:09.739,"Uh, you're not supposed to read this."
00:08:09.822,00:08:12.158,I only glanced at the first few sentences to see what it was.
00:08:12.241,00:08:13.326,It's against the rules.
00:08:13.409,00:08:18.414,"Okay, let's move on from the argument about whether or not I should've looked at it, and just get to the real argument here."
00:08:18.498,00:08:19.540,I'm all ears.
00:08:23.377,00:08:24.212,Never mind.
00:08:24.295,00:08:27.089,I offered a positive assessment of your scholarship.
00:08:27.173,00:08:31.385,The P&amp;T committee doesn't buy it when I don't express any reservations whatsoever.
00:08:31.469,00:08:35.598,"So believe it or not, I'm… I'm trying to help you."
00:08:37.934,00:08:39.936,-You're helping me? -Yes.
00:08:44.982,00:08:50.488,Ji-Yoon came to me and begged me to co-teach with you because your enrollments were so low.
00:08:52.615,00:08:54.617,They were gonna force you to retire.
00:08:54.700,00:08:57.161,So she merged us so that you could piggyback on my enrollments.
00:08:57.245,00:08:58.079,What list?
00:08:59.163,00:09:00.790,You're lecturing to an empty hall.
00:09:00.873,00:09:02.750,Because I don't pander to my students.
00:09:02.833,00:09:05.628,-Nobody wants what you're selling. -I'm not a salesman.
00:09:05.711,00:09:09.006,"You're not a professor either, 'cause you don't have any students."
00:09:11.425,00:09:12.426,John?
00:09:14.554,00:09:16.222,Have you heard about a list?
00:09:16.305,00:09:20.601,"All us dinosaurs, they're targeting us, trying to force us into retirement."
00:09:21.561,00:09:22.937,We gotta band together.
00:09:23.020,00:09:25.022,There's strength in numbers.
00:09:25.648,00:09:29.902,We're still in our intellectual prime and have plenty to offer.
00:09:33.781,00:09:35.157,Was that you or me?
00:09:36.158,00:09:40.538,"For the Distinguished Lectureship, I was thinking of presenting my Yale dissertation."
00:09:41.455,00:09:44.917,The Schizophrenic Critique of Pure Reason in Beckett’s Early Novels.
00:09:45.001,00:09:46.544,I only wrote the one chapter.
00:09:46.627,00:09:50.548,"Well, that's… that's a hell of a chapter. Did you use really big font?"
00:09:51.841,00:09:52.675,Nope.
00:09:52.758,00:09:59.056,"I got sidetracked for a few decades, but I've… I've been thinking recently about finishing it and filing for my PhD."
00:09:59.807,00:10:01.100,Dr. David Duchovny.
00:10:01.183,00:10:02.852,Maybe too much alliteration.
00:10:04.145,00:10:12.570,Do you think it's unfair for people to start thinking of me as Dr. David Duchovny after thinking of me as just David Duchovny for so many years?
00:10:15.239,00:10:21.746,"Um… Anyway, take a gander. I reread it last night. It's… It's pretty good. Prescient, even."
00:10:21.829,00:10:23.247,Prescient? Really?
00:10:25.625,00:10:28.336,"I think it's pronounced prescient, unless we're English."
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.212,Aren't we speaking English?
00:10:30.296,00:10:32.882,"I mean, maybe you chose the wrong department."
00:10:38.012,00:10:42.058,"Oh, and I… I don't say that because you're Asian."
00:10:42.975,00:10:45.102,"I mean, I don't even know that you are Asian."
00:10:45.186,00:10:52.485,"And I don't see color, or ethnicity, or even faces at this point."
00:10:52.568,00:10:55.738,"I just see vibe, an aura."
00:11:05.373,00:11:07.083,"-Would you like a schmoothie? -No, thank you."
00:11:09.669,00:11:10.670,No.
00:11:13.839,00:11:15.841,but I stand corrected.
00:11:15.925,00:11:17.635,"I mean, look… look at that carrot."
00:11:18.678,00:11:20.721,"Anyway, pretend I'm not here."
00:11:38.197,00:11:39.031,Hi.
00:11:39.573,00:11:40.408,Hi.
00:12:18.612,00:12:20.948,Stay here for a sec. I'm trading Pokémon cards.
00:12:26.078,00:12:27.079,Excuse me?
00:12:27.997,00:12:41.302,When children are screaming… -Hold with two hands. -Uh-huh.
00:12:43.304,00:12:46.807,You don't make eye contact or drink in front of another.
00:12:46.891,00:12:48.642,-Okay. -Okay? Like this.
00:12:51.854,00:12:52.688,Okay.
00:12:53.647,00:12:54.732,-Gun bae. -Gum bae.
00:12:54.815,00:12:55.816,Gun bae.
00:13:03.365,00:13:04.533,-Gun. -Gun.
00:13:04.617,00:13:05.451,Gun bae.
00:13:07.536,00:13:10.790,I… I can't just catch you up with a quick tutorial.
00:13:10.873,00:13:11.707,Why not?
00:13:12.792,00:13:14.835,Because that's an insane request.
00:13:14.919,00:13:16.837,This is over 30 years old.
00:13:16.921,00:13:19.590,-A lot has happened in the last 30 years. -Like what?
00:13:21.884,00:13:29.475,"Like affect theory, ecocriticism, digital humanities, new materialism, book history, developments in gender studies and critical race theory."
00:13:29.558,00:13:31.977,When's the last time you picked up an academic journal?
00:13:32.061,00:13:34.522,I… I've been on tour with my band.
00:13:34.605,00:13:36.148,-So… -Hmm. It shows.
00:13:38.150,00:13:45.991,"The fact that you're using this honor from Pembroke to dust off your dissertation and go back and get your PhD, it's… it's self-serving."
00:13:46.075,00:13:51.831,"Whoa. Is… Is this hostility because Pembroke is like this lower-tier Ivy, and I went to Princeton?"
00:13:51.914,00:13:52.998,-No. Okay-- -And Yale?
00:13:53.082,00:13:59.338,"No. no. My God, no. This is hostility because I promised this Distinguished Lectureship to someone who deserves it."
00:13:59.421,00:14:10.182,"The purpose of the talk is to present cutting-edge scholarship, and this reads like it's out of the mid-'80s. I mean, like, the-- The discipline has moved forward, and you're still stuck back in a different era."
00:14:15.396,00:14:16.480,I just need a minute.
00:14:22.152,00:14:23.863,"-Here, can I maybe-- -No."
00:15:37.561,00:15:39.939,Only song I've ever heard quote Wallace Stevens.
00:15:40.022,00:15:41.398,"Fuck, I hope so."
00:15:43.984,00:15:45.110,You have a good voice.
00:15:45.194,00:15:46.320,Mmm.
00:15:55.079,00:15:56.830,Was there someone else before me?
00:15:56.914,00:15:58.749,A celebrity author?
00:15:58.832,00:16:02.294,Did Pembroke offer this position to someone else first?
00:16:04.338,00:16:05.965,"It's all right, I can take it."
00:16:09.259,00:16:11.220,There was talk of James Franco a while back.
00:16:11.303,00:16:12.763,Ugh.
00:16:12.846,00:16:15.015,"-Well, he got his PhD from Yale. -Oh, did he?"
00:16:15.099,00:16:17.685,"-Oh, he got it? Oh. -Yeah. Yes, he… He did. He did."
00:16:18.352,00:16:21.689,"They might've invited Ethan Hawke, but he was shooting in Bulgaria."
00:16:25.359,00:16:27.820,"Well, a movie or a TV series?"
00:16:27.903,00:16:30.864,"Well, I… I don't know what he was shooting."
00:16:30.948,00:16:33.867,-There's a lot of shootin' in Bulgaria. -Okay.
00:16:37.413,00:16:42.292,"Look, so I did all that work at Yale on Beckett, right?"
00:16:45.963,00:16:46.880,Let's take a swim.
00:16:46.964,00:16:49.717,"Oh, I don't… have a bathing suit."
00:16:49.800,00:16:52.761,"Well, you can borrow one. Here, borrow this one."
00:16:52.845,00:16:56.098,"Um, whose… Who… Who wore that?"
00:16:56.181,00:16:58.225,"Oh, it's mine. It's a speedsuit."
00:16:58.308,00:17:02.062,"I wear it when I wanna swim for time. Skin's a drag, you know, 'cause of hair."
00:17:02.146,00:17:04.356,You can't only teach Beckett for the rest of the semester.
00:17:04.440,00:17:10.612,"Why not? You got Murphy, Molloy, Malone Dies-- -The students bought the other books. -So I'll reimburse them."
00:17:10.696,00:17:17.411,"I'm a grossly overpaid actor/musician/novelist, and they're students burdened with student debt."
00:17:17.494,00:17:20.706,"-I will unburden them. -No, the syllabus is a contract with them."
00:17:20.789,00:17:23.000,-You can't change the reading-- -Let's go for a swim.
00:17:23.083,00:17:26.920,"Okay, you know what? Teaching is not a pastime, it's a profession."
00:17:27.004,00:17:31.800,"If you really wanna make a contribution to the field, tell them you've changed your mind."
00:17:31.884,00:17:36.430,"And give them a check to endow a chair in your name, and I'll get you an honorary doctorate."
00:17:36.513,00:17:39.183,The David Duchovny Chair in English Studies?
00:17:39.266,00:17:42.936,The Dr. David Duchovny Chair in English Studies.
00:17:52.780,00:17:53.697,What's this?
00:17:54.239,00:17:55.282,The main event.
00:17:55.866,00:17:57.076,Doljabi ceremony.
00:17:57.576,00:17:59.328,Minji picks her future.
00:17:59.411,00:18:00.245,She's only one.
00:18:00.329,00:18:02.081,"Oh, she… she's very smart."
00:18:02.164,00:18:04.166,She can make a clear decision now.
00:18:05.084,00:18:06.043,What's all this?
00:18:10.631,00:18:17.179,"paintbrush for an artist, money for being rich, a tennis ball for an athlete, and a white string for long life."
00:18:17.262,00:18:20.599,"I would pick the string so I could live a long, long, long time."
00:18:20.682,00:18:21.683,What about you?
00:18:24.645,00:18:25.854,I can only pick one?
00:18:25.938,00:18:26.939,Uh-huh.
00:18:40.410,00:18:43.038,"-Beautiful. -Go! Go, cutie!"
00:19:22.619,00:19:26.123,This isn't authentic. She's clearly tampering with the process right now.
00:19:26.206,00:19:27.541,Let her make her own choice.
00:19:33.338,00:19:35.465,"That lady right there, she rigged it."
00:19:36.967,00:19:39.636,This lady rigg-- She rigged the process.
00:19:39.720,00:19:41.597,She… She wanted the paintbrush. Here.
00:19:41.680,00:19:43.765,"Hey, hey, mama. You can have this."
00:19:45.267,00:19:46.768,"-Hey. -Hold on, hold on."
00:19:46.852,00:19:48.353,She wanted the paintbrush. Oh!
00:20:02.409,00:20:05.579,where you get more respect as you get older.
00:20:05.662,00:20:10.292,"I mean, one of the reasons I went into this was that you don't age out."
00:20:11.376,00:20:13.503,I… I never thought I'd retire.
00:20:14.588,00:20:17.341,As long as you're not… out of it.
00:20:18.133,00:20:19.843,"-Sixty-one. -Oh, Jesus."
00:20:19.927,00:20:22.137,-That's low. -You got your glucose tablets?
00:20:26.350,00:20:30.604,"…you accumulate more wisdom, you garner more respect."
00:20:30.687,00:20:39.321,"I, um… I've been, uh… I've been here for what, 32 years, was chair for six of those, and nothing like this ever happened."
00:20:39.404,00:20:42.574,"A lifetime of doing this, and I get nothing."
00:20:43.116,00:20:47.204,"Well, she wanted me to doctor my tenure letter for Yaz in exchange for co-teacher."
00:20:47.287,00:20:48.622,I get put on a list.
00:20:49.331,00:20:52.167,"What about Bob? I mean, what about Bill? What about Bill?"
00:20:54.044,00:20:56.838,when you look like you just stuck your head in a beehive. Here.
00:20:57.422,00:20:58.757,Bill's not on this list.
00:20:58.840,00:21:01.551,"No, Bill, everybody knows she's in love with him."
00:21:02.177,00:21:06.682,"Now, if one of us had stepped out of line, she would not be going to the mat like this."
00:21:06.765,00:21:08.558,"Mmm. Well, we elected her."
00:21:08.642,00:21:11.311,Her job is to represent our interests.
00:21:11.395,00:21:14.314,-She's only protected his. -We gotta do something.
00:21:15.023,00:21:16.066,Like what?
00:21:41.508,00:21:46.054,"I've got great news. David Duchovny's not giving the Distinguished Lectureship, you are."
00:21:48.765,00:21:49.599,What's wrong?
00:21:50.392,00:21:52.311,I already agreed to give it somewhere else.
00:21:52.394,00:21:53.520,Where?
00:21:54.438,00:21:56.815,"-Yale. -Holy shit, that's great."
00:21:56.898,00:21:58.358,It's also a job talk.
00:21:58.442,00:22:00.736,They've invited me to apply for a position.
00:22:01.653,00:22:02.821,Why didn't you tell me?
00:22:04.865,00:22:09.536,"Look, I know it's been a mess around here."
00:22:12.789,00:22:15.000,You act like you owe them something.
00:22:16.585,00:22:21.131,"Like you're here because they let you be here, not because you deserve it."
00:22:21.214,00:22:24.468,"I mean, what are they without us at this point?"
00:22:24.551,00:22:28.055,-A name and a pile of bricks. -A shit ton of money.
00:22:28.138,00:22:32.142,Seeded by benefactors who got rich off of sugar and cotton and railroads.
00:22:32.225,00:22:34.603,Off the backs of Black people and yellow people.
00:22:35.145,00:22:37.272,"-And, yes, that includes Yale. -Yale's different?"
00:22:41.401,00:22:43.779,"Instead, you're running around playing nice."
00:22:45.989,00:22:48.742,You think that's how I got here? By playing nice?
00:22:48.825,00:22:50.577,Is that how you think I fucking got here?
00:22:52.871,00:22:53.872,No.
00:22:55.499,00:23:00.087,You are gonna be the first tenured Black woman in the department.
00:23:01.713,00:23:03.048,That's why I'm leaving.
00:23:09.346,00:23:12.766,Pembroke said and did all the right things to keep me here.
00:23:12.849,00:23:15.227,But you know the real reason I stayed?
00:23:16.603,00:23:23.693,"It was because of Joan, and Bill, and this dazzling new hire named Yaz."
00:23:27.197,00:23:28.240,Fucking Yale.
00:23:34.746,00:23:38.917,You know what New Haven's ranking is on WalletHub's list of best college towns in America?
00:23:40.085,00:23:41.503,A hundred and ninety-eight.
00:23:41.586,00:23:45.215,"A couple notches below Fargo, North Dakota."
00:23:46.341,00:23:47.426,What are we?
00:23:48.009,00:23:49.761,I don't know. I'll have to ask my dad.
00:23:54.141,00:23:55.142,What are they offering?
00:23:56.560,00:24:00.439,Expedited tenure and an endowed professorship.
00:24:02.149,00:24:03.692,And a shit ton of money.
00:24:03.775,00:24:04.943,We can beat that.
00:24:07.946,00:24:08.905,I think.
00:24:09.698,00:24:12.742,"I'm getting a little bit full, but I love… It's wonderful."
00:24:13.994,00:24:16.830,"Uh, Mr. Kim, thank… thank you all for helping clean up."
00:24:16.913,00:24:20.625,You didn't have to do that. But it's nice to see my table.
00:24:24.296,00:24:25.755,I need the pizza.
00:24:27.090,00:24:30.177,Excuse me a second. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
00:24:58.079,00:25:00.415,-Thank you. -I hope I didn't mess it up.
00:25:04.544,00:25:07.464,"I couldn't find any pizza, but I have pizza rolls."
00:25:09.424,00:25:11.259,"Okay, what do we do?"
00:25:11.343,00:25:13.887,-We're gonna make a trail. -Okay.
00:25:51.216,00:25:52.551,She's gonna find you.
00:26:02.185,00:26:03.228,Bye.
00:26:05.063,00:26:07.023,Wait. I have a question.
00:26:10.569,00:26:13.738,"Um, what did Ji-Yoon pick for her Dol ceremony?"
00:26:13.822,00:26:14.656,Do you remember?
00:26:15.699,00:26:17.200,"Yeah, she picked a pencil."
00:26:18.868,00:26:21.788,She go straight there. No one can stop her.
00:11:30.940,00:11:33.442,"What is it, darling girl?"
00:11:41.283,00:11:43.369,Don't cry in front of her.
00:11:43.452,00:11:44.912,It will scare her.
00:11:44.995,00:11:46.580,I'm not scared.
00:11:47.623,00:11:49.417,She understands.
00:00:09.009,00:00:12.053,"When my mom was sick, I tried to start cooking, to help out."
00:00:12.929,00:00:17.350,"But she was always like, No. Go study."
00:00:18.268,00:00:20.603,She never wanted me to do anything homemaker-y.
00:00:21.938,00:00:25.150,I wasn't gonna be a housewife. I was gonna be a doctor.
00:00:26.693,00:00:29.320,"Well, not this kind of doctor, obviously."
00:00:32.115,00:00:41.458,"I got engaged when I was 36, and he wanted to start a family, but… but then he was offered a… a job at Michigan."
00:00:43.168,00:00:51.176,"They tried to negotiate a spousal hire for me, but… They offered a three-year instructor contract."
00:00:51.676,00:00:54.304,A fucking 5/4 teaching load for diddly-squat.
00:00:57.766,00:01:19.954,"We tried to make it work long-distance, but… I wasn't even… I had a half dozen R1 universities begging for me to apply."
00:01:23.416,00:01:32.425,"But Pembroke's retention offer was… They gave me everything I wanted, so I stayed."
00:01:45.438,00:01:50.485,Ever been on the cover of a newspaper for having inflicted harm on a large group of people?
00:01:50.568,00:01:55.949,"It's like… It's like Pol Pot, and Stalin, and me. It's-- Listen, we're almost out of time."
00:01:56.032,00:02:01.121,"And since this is your daughter's session, I'm going to move on to her now if that's okay."
00:02:01.204,00:02:02.205,Of course.
00:02:05.291,00:02:07.418,-What is it? -Poison.
00:02:17.345,00:02:18.346,Oh.
00:02:26.104,00:02:28.148,"Isn't this exciting, sweetie?"
00:02:28.815,00:02:29.816,"Wait, what?"
00:02:31.192,00:02:33.319,"Actually, I don't want Habi to come."
00:02:34.195,00:02:36.197,"Oh, why? He got all dressed up."
00:02:36.281,00:02:37.282,Ju Ju!
00:02:38.908,00:02:40.952,Can you just stay for one minute?
00:02:42.620,00:02:44.038,"No, I can't."
00:02:44.664,00:02:45.665,"Here, honey."
00:02:46.249,00:02:48.960,Take-- Have a good presentation.
00:02:50.336,00:02:51.337,Wah!
00:03:03.308,00:03:10.148,"There are some quotations, like this one from Audre Lorde, that are so well-known we assume we understand them."
00:03:10.231,00:03:14.694,But I'm curious to hear if reading the actual essay surprised you in any way.
00:03:19.157,00:03:20.575,You're all so quiet.
00:03:20.658,00:03:23.119,What's your relationship to that idea?
00:03:23.203,00:03:25.914,"I want to hear yours. Come on. Anyone, jump in."
00:03:27.207,00:03:32.003,"Well, the university, being a bastion of white supremacy, that's the master's house."
00:03:32.086,00:03:37.425,"Therefore, whatever you learn or teach, those are the master's tools."
00:03:37.508,00:03:42.889,"Some women in the academy pretend to be allies, but they're not really doing the work."
00:03:42.972,00:03:48.478,"They stick a couple of Black women on their panels or on their syllabi, pat themselves on the back, and call it a day."
00:03:48.561,00:03:52.649,It's not enough to just insert a few people of color.
00:03:57.820,00:04:01.449,"Hey, hey, hey, listen. You are nobody's lackey."
00:04:01.532,00:04:03.785,"-You take no prisoners, right? Huh? -Yes! Yes!"
00:04:03.910,00:04:05.703,You're a tiger! Get in there! Gimme it!
00:04:06.913,00:04:07.997,Oh shit!
00:04:13.378,00:04:17.340,"I'm… I'm sorry, I was looking for the Ethics and Compliance office."
00:04:17.423,00:04:20.093,You're in the right place. We merged with Title IX.
00:04:20.176,00:04:24.138,But… So where's the other coordinator?
00:04:24.222,00:04:26.975,It's just me. We're now a department of one.
00:04:28.434,00:04:30.186,Is this still about your office?
00:04:34.357,00:04:38.736,I started as an assistant professor here 32 years ago.
00:04:39.696,00:04:42.073,"They offered me $26,000."
00:04:43.449,00:04:52.125,"But I found out that John McHale, who… who started the same year I did and is still kicking around, got 16,000 more."
00:04:52.208,00:04:57.630,"-Mm-hmm. -I thought about saying something, but I didn't wanna be that woman."
00:05:01.092,00:05:07.515,I wrote a book on Chaucer that was the first feminist reading of The Wife of Bath.
00:05:07.598,00:05:13.604,"But here at the department, they'd ask for a volunteer to be on faculty governance, Oh, let's have Joan do it."
00:05:13.688,00:05:18.818,"Or they needed someone to host the annual holiday party, Joan won't mind. Joan loves parties."
00:05:18.901,00:05:24.824,It's a well-documented fact that departmental service falls disproportionately on female faculty.
00:05:28.453,00:05:34.834,"I, um… I let my research go, and I never went up for full professor."
00:05:39.005,00:05:40.089,But I'll tell you what.
00:05:40.173,00:05:46.846,This is the last straw. I am not gonna just sit back-- What outcome are you hoping for here?
00:05:47.555,00:05:53.269,"No one who worked at Pembroke in the '80s is still around, who'd be accountable for this."
00:05:53.353,00:06:00.985,"And… our records go back, but I don't know if they go back-- I want someone to acknowledge what happened."
00:06:01.069,00:06:02.320,I'm acknowledging it.
00:06:03.196,00:06:05.656,It sounds totally illegal.
00:06:10.828,00:06:12.789,Have you talked to your chair?
00:06:21.422,00:06:22.423,Attagirl.
00:06:25.718,00:06:26.719,Now?
00:06:36.145,00:06:38.106,I'm not sure we can put that squarely on Ji-Yoon.
00:06:38.189,00:06:40.274,-I assume you've seen this? -Yes.
00:06:43.111,00:06:51.661,"At this point, our ability to function as a pedagogical institution is-- Nobody's coming to class. They're too busy marching."
00:06:51.744,00:06:53.830,Marching puts the system on notice.
00:06:58.584,00:07:02.046,On notice that Ji-Yoon needs to be replaced.
00:07:02.130,00:07:04.966,-Nobody's gonna register. -I'm not teaching Freshman Composition!
00:07:05.049,00:07:14.392,"After the termination hearing, Ji-Yoon's gonna recommend to the provost that Bill be dismissed, which will undo this perception that the department's initial stance wasn't strong enough."
00:07:14.475,00:07:15.601,This is gaining traction.
00:07:15.685,00:07:19.772,We will just wait and see how Bill's hearing goes in the morning.
00:07:19.856,00:07:24.026,"And whatever you do, you'd better have the backing of the full department."
00:07:27.697,00:07:29.157,You've become a scandalous figure.
00:07:29.240,00:07:33.578,"Nobody wants to go to bat for you, nobody wants to come out and support you when you're a scandalous figure."
00:07:33.661,00:07:36.247,I've been there 25 years. I have a lot of support.
00:07:36.330,00:07:39.000,"The chair of my department, she's got my back."
00:07:39.083,00:07:42.545,-She's the one who sent you this? -That's just a pro forma thing.
00:07:49.051,00:07:52.388,"If I take a settlement, that's like I'm admitting wrongdoing."
00:07:52.972,00:07:55.057,"Your daughter's a freshman at Columbia, right?"
00:07:56.851,00:07:59.312,Will you be able to afford that without a salary?
00:07:59.395,00:08:01.481,I can't afford it with a salary.
00:08:01.564,00:08:03.649,I can make sure you get what you're owed.
00:08:04.275,00:08:06.486,You could buy a little apartment in New York.
00:08:06.569,00:08:09.864,What about a brand-new city? What destinations are on your bucket list?
00:08:09.947,00:08:12.366,I've always wanted to see Hitler's mountain retreat.
00:08:13.826,00:08:17.997,"I'm going to be very frank with you, Professor Dobson."
00:08:18.080,00:08:19.457,Do with it what you will.
00:08:19.957,00:08:22.668,Your ability to make a living is in jeopardy.
00:08:24.253,00:08:27.757,"Given that he's tenured, here are the portions that apply."
00:08:27.840,00:08:35.389,"Insubordination, immorality, a lack of collegiality, unethical conduct, and/or conduct unbecoming."
00:08:35.473,00:08:37.767,Lack of collegiality? That's very vague.
00:08:37.850,00:08:39.977,-Here's how I suggest we play this. -Play?
00:08:40.561,00:08:46.067,You'll read from the affidavit alleging what took place in the classroom and town hall-- The dean should be the one to do that.
00:08:46.150,00:08:51.489,"It'd be better if Dean Larson, as the one presiding over the hearing, didn't also have to present the evidence."
00:08:51.572,00:08:54.951,-Have you compiled the student complaints? -I haven't printed them out yet.
00:08:55.034,00:08:56.160,How many are there?
00:08:58.538,00:09:04.961,"Uh, but I've also received some strong endorsements of Bill, students who have been deeply impacted by his teaching over the years."
00:09:08.965,00:09:30.653,"This… This has become a… What we are trying to do here is create a narrative that will allow you to realign with your students, regain their trust."
00:09:30.736,00:09:38.494,"Because right now, the perception is that you are defending your boyfriend who goose-stepped his way across a classroom."
00:09:40.496,00:09:43.624,-I saw her in the lounge with everyone. -Who's everyone?
00:09:43.708,00:09:46.502,"Rentz, McHale, uh, Yaz. They were in a meeting."
00:09:46.586,00:09:48.337,What meeting? Was it the whole department?
00:09:48.421,00:09:51.382,"Ji-Yoon, someone from the New York Times just called."
00:09:51.465,00:09:54.135,"-About Bill? -No, about you."
00:09:54.218,00:09:57.138,They're asking to interview you about the gag order.
00:09:57.221,00:10:00.016,-What? -The cover of the Daily?
00:10:00.099,00:10:03.060,-The gag order that you placed-- -Stop saying gag order!
00:10:04.353,00:10:07.148,Wait. No. Say it as much as you want.
00:10:13.863,00:10:14.989,Yep. Will do.
00:10:15.072,00:10:18.075,I know that you didn't mean it the way they construed it.
00:10:18.659,00:10:19.660,Not your fault.
00:10:26.334,00:10:31.172,I wrote a statement in support of Bill. I wanted you to have it before tomorrow.
00:10:31.255,00:10:33.132,"Submit it to the committee, okay?"
00:10:33.215,00:10:37.553,"-I thought you were the committee. -Just, um… directly to the dean."
00:10:37.637,00:10:40.139,Someone… Someone other than me.
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.478,What's your take on Professor Barron?
00:10:45.561,00:10:46.687,What about him?
00:10:46.771,00:10:49.857,How would you feel about him taking over as your dissertation adviser?
00:10:54.362,00:10:58.240,I… I sent him a paper my first semester to see if he'd give me some feedback.
00:10:59.617,00:11:00.951,Never got a response.
00:11:01.035,00:11:02.036,I'll talk to him.
00:11:06.248,00:11:07.958,You're putting me on a lifeboat.
00:11:08.626,00:11:09.960,Feels like it's time.
00:11:13.005,00:11:14.131,Do you have one?
00:12:05.349,00:12:13.149,"No. I'm sorry, you can't. It's not okay for you-- It took a lot to work up the courage, so I'm just-- But… Hang… Wait, wait."
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.025,"Uh, you can't sit there."
00:12:15.109,00:12:17.278,Don't take your jacket off. Don't… Hold on.
00:12:18.863,00:12:21.407,"Uh, just one second. Jesus."
00:12:23.993,00:12:27.413,"Okay, um, when you leave, you're gonna leave out the back door."
00:12:27.496,00:12:29.457,"No, it's gonna look like you didn't leave."
00:12:29.540,00:12:32.501,"I just wanna ask you something, and I want you to be honest."
00:12:32.585,00:12:36.797,"If the answer is no, I will be… I will be totally fine."
00:12:36.881,00:12:40.426,"Okay, look, I'm… I'm old enough to be your dad."
00:12:40.509,00:12:47.308,"And, um, whatever you think you feel about me, it's not-- -Your feelings aren't about me. -Wait."
00:12:47.391,00:12:49.852,You… You think I came here to try to fuck you?
00:12:59.695,00:13:01.864,-That's-- Yeah. -Yeah.
00:13:03.115,00:13:05.284,This is like a crazy comedy of errors.
00:13:05.367,00:13:08.204,"Yes, it is. I'm gonna look back on this moment and laugh."
00:13:08.287,00:13:13.417,"Yeah, okay. So you're still… You're still with the same publisher, right? The New Press?"
00:13:14.710,00:13:15.544,Mm-hmm.
00:13:15.628,00:13:20.299,"I was just, um, wondering if you'd consider reading my first novel."
00:13:20.382,00:13:26.347,I'm submitting it to them and I… I wasn't sure if they'd broken ties with you over this whole thing.
00:13:26.430,00:13:28.849,-But-- -When did this… Is this today?
00:13:28.933,00:13:31.477,"Uh, I don't know. Yesterday?"
00:13:31.560,00:13:33.979,"-Uh, Jesus Christ. -It's all over Twitter."
00:13:35.481,00:13:37.775,Should I just leave this here? My… My book.
00:13:37.858,00:13:40.236,It's a quick read. You can do it in like one sitting.
00:13:43.364,00:13:46.158,"Just… If anybody asks, we didn't fuck, okay?"
00:13:52.915,00:13:55.209,What's going on? Did you get taller again?
00:13:55.292,00:13:58.128,-Can you stay for dinner? -Go inside. Move.
00:13:58.212,00:14:00.548,"-You're not the boss of me. -Oh. Yes, I am."
00:14:01.340,00:14:04.885,"That's what I'm always telling her, but unfortunately for both of us, she is."
00:14:07.304,00:14:09.932,You take away everything good about life!
00:14:13.018,00:14:15.521,No wonder nobody wanted to marry you!
00:14:23.863,00:14:24.864,Hi.
00:14:26.824,00:14:29.660,"Hey, I saw the Daily. Are you okay?"
00:14:29.743,00:14:32.454,I'm the face of totalitarianism on campus.
00:14:32.538,00:14:34.039,"Don't say, What else is new?"
00:14:34.540,00:14:38.878,"I'm literally being called Hitler, so I don't think you get to be the face of totalitarianism."
00:14:38.961,00:14:40.588,"Oh, oh. You win."
00:14:41.088,00:14:44.258,I'm just saying I know you were just trying to walk the line.
00:14:44.884,00:14:48.095,"Listen, you're living proof this entire world hasn't gone completely insane."
00:14:51.765,00:14:57.521,"I met with a lawyer. She had this whole plan about how I could get a settlement. If they try to fire me, I could sue."
00:15:00.482,00:15:04.612,"I could go live in Paris, produce great works of literature."
00:15:04.695,00:15:07.489,"-Well, that is a total cliché. -It didn't include you."
00:15:13.954,00:15:15.789,"And then I was like, Why can't it?"
00:15:20.711,00:15:23.714,Don't tell me you wanna stay at that shithole after the way they treated us.
00:15:23.797,00:15:25.799,I can't just run away.
00:15:25.883,00:15:31.889,"I have a lot invested here. My dad, Ju Ju-- In this scenario, we would go as a family."
00:15:33.057,00:15:35.809,-I still love teaching. -I know. I know you do.
00:15:38.604,00:15:41.982,"But there are other universities, and they'll be fighting for you."
00:15:42.066,00:15:49.073,It doesn't matter if it's Paris or Peoria… I'll follow you.
00:15:50.324,00:15:51.325,I'll go anywhere.
00:16:14.014,00:16:15.307,I have to fire you.
00:16:15.933,00:16:16.850,Huh?
00:16:16.934,00:16:23.148,"I mean, I… I have to recommend to the provost and the board of trustees that they fire you."
00:16:24.650,00:16:27.277,"Uh, don't I have a hearing tomorrow?"
00:16:27.361,00:16:31.490,They're closing ranks around you. It's… It's a kangaroo court.
00:16:35.327,00:16:38.998,But are-- When… When were you gonna tell me?
00:16:40.207,00:16:41.917,You didn't return my calls.
00:16:43.669,00:16:44.962,Are you helping them?
00:16:45.045,00:16:47.131,What do you… What do you mean?
00:16:47.214,00:16:50.759,Are you presenting evidence against me?
00:16:51.343,00:16:53.679,My students are turning on me.
00:16:53.762,00:16:55.597,I am being seen as complicit.
00:16:59.018,00:17:01.603,How about helping me by doing what's right?
00:17:02.604,00:17:07.651,"I've been hanging on by a fucking thread for a year and now you, you-- You did this."
00:17:08.193,00:17:14.199,"You ignored all my advice that might've ended it, and you kept digging and digging until you buried the both of us."
00:17:14.867,00:17:18.037,And now you're gonna guilt me for not helping you?
00:17:19.496,00:17:30.674,"I love Sharon, and I miss Sharon, and if she could see how you are using her death as an excuse to indulge in all this self-destructive bullshit, she would be ashamed of you."
00:17:41.810,00:17:44.438,I never would've pegged you for a lackey of the dean.
00:17:52.321,00:17:58.035,"Even if you stop talking to me, I'm still gonna talk to you, so… I love you."
00:17:58.118,00:17:59.119,Goodnight.
00:18:00.704,00:18:02.164,Why are you a doctor?
00:18:05.042,00:18:12.382,Oh. Because… I wanted to read novels and poems for as long as I could.
00:18:13.133,00:18:14.134,Why?
00:18:16.053,00:18:19.681,Uh… to try and understand their meaning.
00:18:21.225,00:18:23.393,But why are you a doctor?
00:18:23.477,00:18:25.771,You… You never help anybody.
00:18:33.237,00:18:34.988,No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:18:35.072,00:18:36.907,No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:18:36.990,00:18:38.909,No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:18:38.992,00:18:41.161,No Nazis at Pembroke!
00:18:42.162,00:18:45.207,This is a hearing on Professor Bill Dobson's dismissal charge.
00:18:45.290,00:18:54.842,"We're here to determine whether the behavior you exhibited …conduct unbecoming, uh, as defined in the faculty handbook."
00:18:55.425,00:18:59.388,"Before we get to that, we want to give you a meaningful opportunity to be heard."
00:19:00.556,00:19:04.977,Give you a chance to submit evidence to controvert these grounds for dismissal.
00:19:06.353,00:19:07.354,Okay.
00:19:12.442,00:19:14.361,Nazis out! Nazis out!
00:19:14.444,00:19:15.529,Aren't you gonna read it?
00:19:16.530,00:19:27.082,It's too long. I mean… Don't you want to say something?
00:19:31.003,00:19:43.140,"I was… I was thinking this morning, uh… that to be an English teacher… you have to fall in love with stories, with literature."
00:19:43.223,00:19:50.272,And what you're doing when you do that is… is you're… You're always trying to see things from someone else's point of view.
00:19:52.065,00:20:07.789,"You're trying to occupy a different space. Uh… And… when you're in the middle of a story, you're in a state of possibility, as opposed to whatever state of oppressiveness you're in in real life."
00:20:08.999,00:20:15.923,"The text is kind of a living thing, and it's a dance, an ongoing conversation that you have with it."
00:20:17.216,00:20:28.352,"Sometimes, you love a poem so much, you-- Every time you read it, you learn something new and you feel transformed by it."
00:20:31.980,00:20:35.734,It's a very complicated but faithful relationship.
00:20:42.783,00:20:46.328,"Thank you for that lecture, Professor Dobson."
00:20:46.411,00:20:53.543,"-Ji-Yoon, would you, uh-- -Wait, that's, um… What are we doing here?"
00:20:55.504,00:20:58.090,Firing him isn't gonna change the culture here.
00:20:58.757,00:21:00.342,When were you last in a classroom?
00:21:00.425,00:21:03.428,Ji-Yoon-- Or had a personal interaction with a student?
00:21:06.139,00:21:08.141,I don't need you to save my reputation.
00:21:08.225,00:21:09.810,"Ji-Yoon, please."
00:21:09.893,00:21:10.894,Those people?
00:21:11.895,00:21:13.522,Those are our students.
00:21:14.231,00:21:21.071,Our job is… is not to… to trick them or manage them or… or make them fall in line.
00:21:26.326,00:21:29.454,"No, no. Why should they trust us? The world is burning."
00:21:29.538,00:21:32.207,And we're sitting up here worried about our endowment?
00:21:32.749,00:21:35.168,Our latest ranking on U.S. News &amp; World Report?
00:21:35.252,00:21:38.714,"If you think Bill is a Nazi, then by all means fire him."
00:21:38.797,00:21:45.345,"If you're hoping that just by getting rid of him you're gonna stop what's going on outside, they're gonna see right through that."
00:21:46.805,00:21:50.684,What do you think is gonna happen when he's fired and nothing else changes?
00:21:58.483,00:22:05.282,"According to the faculty handbook, this is supposed to be an impartial panel… and I am not."
00:22:08.952,00:22:11.913,"Therefore, this is not a fair procedure."
00:22:19.504,00:22:21.798,Word is you put on some performance.
00:22:22.466,00:22:23.467,And Bill?
00:22:25.635,00:22:34.353,"They've decided it would be helpful in terms of optics to remove me, but they didn't want another lawsuit on their hands, so you're stuck with me for the time being."
00:22:41.610,00:22:42.444,Okay.
00:22:45.280,00:22:47.616,-Is this about-- -That was Joan's item as well.
00:22:49.284,00:22:51.745,"-Go for it. -No, we don't have to go first."
00:22:56.917,00:23:03.507,"Uh, Ji-Yoon, we so appreciate your willingness to step up and steer the troubled vessel that is the English department."
00:23:03.590,00:23:04.966,"Here we go, ship metaphors."
00:23:10.055,00:23:15.352,"Our very field is at stake, both within the university itself and in the culture at large."
00:23:15.435,00:23:17.437,We don't have time for any more missteps.
00:23:17.521,00:23:22.526,We're calling for a vote of no confidence in Professor Kim as chair.
00:23:24.403,00:23:25.320,All in favor?
00:23:25.404,00:23:29.324,"Actually, department bylaws state that you can't take a voice vote for chair removal."
00:23:29.950,00:23:31.410,We have to go round the room.
00:23:32.077,00:23:34.246,"When you're untenured, you read the bylaws."
00:23:35.414,00:23:37.916,"Obviously, I'm in favor."
00:23:37.999,00:23:39.751,"Uh, McHale?"
00:23:41.086,00:23:42.337,"How about you, Jim?"
00:23:47.008,00:23:49.177,The only reason we're here is because you supported this.
00:23:56.393,00:23:58.145,I'm a no. I can't do it.
00:23:58.645,00:23:59.771,Unbelievable.
00:23:59.855,00:24:01.398,-I'm with Rentz. -No.
00:24:06.111,00:24:09.614,That makes six for and five against.
00:24:09.698,00:24:11.575,"That was close, a real squeaker."
00:24:13.910,00:24:16.913,and I'd like to offer my services as interim chair.
00:24:16.997,00:24:19.291,"Oh, fuck no. I vote Joan to replace me."
00:24:23.420,00:24:26.214,"It's a shit job, but it comes with an office."
00:24:26.298,00:24:28.425,All those in favor of Joan as chair.
00:24:35.849,00:25:05.879,"That perches in the soul And sings the tune without the words And never stops at all I’ve heard it in the chillest land And on the strangest sea Yet never in extremity It asked a crumb of me So, what do you… What do you think she means when she says hope never asked a crumb of her?"
00:25:05.962,00:25:07.714,"It's… It's a weird locution, right?"
00:25:08.215,00:25:10.842,And why is hope the thing with feathers?
00:25:11.843,00:25:14.971,"It's airborne, like a bird."
00:25:18.308,00:25:21.853,Why does she describe the song as a tune without the words?
00:25:27.692,00:25:29.986,…and know we cannot live within.
00:25:30.070,00:25:33.365,Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does.
00:25:34.032,00:25:41.039,Love is a value… just a melody.
00:25:59.057,00:26:00.308,She's the real deal.
00:26:01.268,00:26:06.606,"Um… You won't regret it, I promise."
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.567,Why does she put in so many dashes?
00:26:14.906,00:26:18.368,that she's not saying or able to articulate.
00:26:23.540,00:26:29.087,"I mean, these dashes and gaps, it's been a subject of scholarly debate for, like, a century."

00:27:19.512,00:27:21.264,Not being chair suits you.
00:27:26.353,00:27:28.188,Does it feel weird to be on campus?
00:27:31.650,00:27:34.402,So are you filthy rich or stinking rich?
00:27:34.486,00:27:36.404,-Which is more? -I think filthy.
