00:02:00.166,00:02:01.458,Wave to your father.
00:02:05.125,00:02:08.083,"Today, I will be delivered to the Archduke Ferdinand at the gala."
00:02:09.041,00:02:12.125,I expect you to behave with distinction on this hunt.
00:02:14.166,00:02:15.375,and Godspeed.
00:02:15.458,00:02:17.916,"Could they not fit you a rocking chair on that horse, grandad?"
00:02:18.458,00:02:21.958,You'll all be my gun bearers by evening. Have no doubt of that!
00:03:10.375,00:03:11.500,Ha!
00:03:20.458,00:03:22.625,"Major, there's no path there!"
00:03:39.125,00:03:40.125,Good boy.
00:04:03.291,00:04:06.916,To death... the best source to life!
00:04:14.833,00:04:16.958,"-Daddy did it! -Come here, you."
00:04:17.625,00:04:20.166,"-Daddy! -Well done, Daddy."
00:04:20.333,00:04:23.125,"Someday, you and I will go hunting together."
00:04:54.291,00:04:55.916,We're going to be late.
00:04:56.041,00:04:58.333,"Oh, God, it's this damn thing."
00:05:01.916,00:05:04.666,"You must be so pleased with yourselves. You, men."
00:05:05.666,00:05:07.708,Making us wear these awful things.
00:05:12.916,00:05:13.916,I know.
00:05:15.750,00:05:16.750,Well?
00:05:18.458,00:05:19.875,Rather lovely.
00:05:22.750,00:05:24.708,What is it? What's amiss?
00:05:29.000,00:05:39.583,"Well, my darling, I will be the only man there tonight, of my rank, -whose uniform is unadorned. -How can that matter now?"
00:05:40.416,00:05:43.875,The great Secretary Bryce will be at the gala.
00:05:44.500,00:05:46.166,"Oh, Ms. Fawcett..."
00:05:47.333,00:05:48.875,You've no medals.
00:05:49.000,00:05:54.750,"Oh, no, Mr. Bryce. You see, I've been terribly busy teaching ancient militiamen to point their rifles at tree stumps, so..."
00:05:55.166,00:05:56.166,"No, no."
00:05:56.583,00:05:58.333,"No medals for me, Sir."
00:06:02.500,00:06:03.625,Tell me...
00:06:05.583,00:06:08.083,Who's this Secretary Bryce when he's at home?
00:06:09.791,00:06:14.833,The last man here upon whom we might possibly rely for advancement.
00:06:15.666,00:06:16.666,I see.
00:06:18.958,00:06:24.875,"I'm getting older, cheeky... and very impatient of lost years."
00:06:25.708,00:06:28.791,I know the medals are ridiculous. I do.
00:06:44.875,00:06:45.875,"Honor's mine, Sir."
00:06:46.083,00:06:49.291,"Good to meet you. Meet Secretary Bryce, Secretary Bryce, Mrs. Bellamy."
00:07:16.291,00:07:18.750,May I present this magnificent animal.
00:07:20.375,00:07:23.458,"Well, I am dancing with you, so I've got the better of the bargain."
00:07:27.916,00:07:29.291,Spoken too soon.
00:07:38.250,00:07:40.250,"By the way, who got the kill?"
00:07:40.750,00:07:43.791,"Oh, that would be Major Fawcett, Mr. Secretary."
00:07:44.125,00:07:46.166,"Well, we should invite him to supper."
00:07:46.833,00:07:47.833,Oh...
00:07:48.333,00:07:55.166,"Well, may I say... he's been rather unfortunate in his choice of ancestors."
00:07:56.000,00:07:57.000,I see.
00:07:57.333,00:07:58.333,"Well, then..."
00:07:59.000,00:08:01.666,Tell me. How is Lady Bernard?
00:08:48.333,00:08:53.000,"-Sir? -You're off to London tomorrow, to the Royal Geographical Society."
00:08:53.791,00:08:55.791,"The Royal Geographical, Society?"
00:09:06.000,00:09:07.000,"Thank you, Sir."
00:09:28.125,00:09:29.125,Thank you.
00:09:45.416,00:09:47.000,"Major Fawcett, Sir."
00:09:48.708,00:09:50.750,"Oh, yes, yes. Come in."
00:09:53.041,00:09:55.833,I am Sir George Goldie. President of the RGS.
00:09:56.333,00:09:59.500,"This is Mr. John Scott Keltie, our Secretary."
00:09:59.625,00:10:01.666,"-How do you do, Major? -How do you do, Sir?"
00:10:01.958,00:10:05.791,"Our paths have not crossed during our work here several years back, did they?"
00:10:06.291,00:10:07.416,"They did not, Sir."
00:10:07.916,00:10:10.500,I was likely consumed with my studies at the time.
00:10:11.125,00:10:12.125,Of course.
00:10:21.000,00:10:24.916,"Yes, I've served in Ceylon, and in Hong Kong before that."
00:10:25.083,00:10:26.916,Most recently in Ireland.
00:10:34.291,00:10:37.708,"Major, what do you know about Bolivia?"
00:10:38.541,00:10:40.958,"-In South America, Sir? -That's right."
00:10:42.291,00:10:43.541,Only what I've read.
00:10:43.666,00:10:45.541,Hm. Then you can't know very much.
00:10:45.916,00:10:49.208,This is as good a map of Bolivia as we have.
00:10:49.333,00:10:52.666,"Most of it's blank, as you can see. Nothing's really known about it at all."
00:10:55.750,00:10:59.250,But there are rubber plantations all over Amazonia.
00:11:00.041,00:11:01.250,Very profitable.
00:11:02.833,00:11:09.083,"There is now considerable argument between Bolivia and Brazil, as to what constitutes their border."
00:11:09.208,00:11:14.708,"So fantastically high is the price of rubber, that war could arise."
00:11:15.375,00:11:16.708,Do you follow?
00:11:18.416,00:11:20.000,"-I do, Sir. -Mm-hm."
00:11:20.500,00:11:23.416,"Although, I'm not sure what this has to do with me."
00:11:26.833,00:11:34.708,"Neither country will accept mapping done by the other, so they've requested us to act as referee."
00:11:35.000,00:11:42.125,"Mm. As you've completed your mapping here with distinction, you came under our consideration."
00:11:43.000,00:11:44.541,-I see. -Mm-hm.
00:11:48.416,00:11:50.958,"-Sirs, may I speak candidly? -Please."
00:11:52.833,00:11:55.458,My survey work was long ago.
00:11:56.708,00:12:02.375,"And to be quite honest, I was rather hoping for a position -where I might see a fair bit of action. -Major."
00:12:02.958,00:12:06.041,This is far more than just survey work.
00:12:06.916,00:12:09.666,This is exploration in the jungle.
00:12:10.208,00:12:12.291,The environment's brutally difficult.
00:12:13.041,00:12:14.625,Terrible disease.
00:12:14.750,00:12:18.541,Murderous savages. The journey may well mean your life.
00:12:18.958,00:12:22.041,"At the very least, you will be gone for several years."
00:12:24.666,00:12:28.625,such an undertaking could earn you soldierly decoration.
00:12:29.541,00:12:30.791,And...
00:12:30.916,00:12:33.333,even reclaim your family name.
00:12:40.625,00:12:41.625,Did you?
00:12:43.125,00:12:44.125,Yes.
00:12:45.166,00:12:46.583,I did not.
00:12:47.625,00:12:48.791,Terrible thing...
00:12:49.083,00:12:52.250,A man's love of drink and gaming.
00:12:52.875,00:12:57.833,"But as I say, success in this venture could change your lot."
00:12:59.083,00:13:00.500,Considerably.
00:13:12.000,00:13:15.375,"-Like that. -Does it look big, like a big brain?"
00:13:15.958,00:13:17.458,It looks round.
00:13:22.000,00:13:23.333,"Jack, will you go and play?"
00:13:24.291,00:13:26.041,I want to talk to your father for a minute.
00:13:53.750,00:13:55.666,He'll not know you when you return.
00:14:02.708,00:14:04.250,I have something to tell you.
00:14:08.500,00:14:10.958,I believe I'm going to have another child.
00:14:16.875,00:14:18.791,I know I'm having another child.
00:14:24.708,00:14:25.916,Don't be sad.
00:14:27.625,00:14:29.375,I'm an independent woman.
00:14:34.833,00:14:37.791,Cheeky... Darling...
00:14:39.916,00:14:42.583,I know this is a sacrifice for all of us.
00:14:44.083,00:14:45.708,But it will be worth it.
00:17:10.791,00:17:12.083,Henry Costin.
00:17:12.916,00:17:15.125,I applied to your advert in the Times.
00:17:15.625,00:17:17.083,I'm your aide-de-camp.
00:17:17.750,00:17:20.458,"-Mr. Costin? -Reporting for duty, Sir."
00:17:21.250,00:17:25.250,We've been at sea a week. Why are you just presenting yourself now?
00:17:25.583,00:17:28.083,"I wanted to make sure you were up to the task, Sir."
00:17:30.625,00:17:33.291,"-Are you drunk, Mr. Costin? -No."
00:17:35.166,00:17:36.166,Well...
00:17:36.875,00:17:37.916,Well...
00:17:42.291,00:17:45.083,I've got a... letter of commendation.
00:17:46.583,00:17:50.000,You'll see I'm both skilled at rifle and pistols.
00:17:51.125,00:17:52.500,A medal for bravery.
00:17:53.291,00:17:54.583,That's very impressive.
00:17:59.583,00:18:02.166,"I see, so nothing to shed."
00:18:03.125,00:18:04.583,I take it you do then.
00:18:06.083,00:18:08.000,"Mr. Costin, I would like to be clear."
00:18:09.750,00:18:14.000,My reputation as a man rests entirely on our success.
00:18:15.500,00:18:18.625,I think you shall find me capable of every sacrifice.
00:18:20.333,00:18:22.166,"Therefore, I must insist..."
00:18:24.416,00:18:25.958,"Oh! Right you are, Sir."
00:18:30.458,00:18:34.375,-We'll need all the fortitude you've got. -Understood.
00:18:58.291,00:19:01.833,We have new orders. To map the Verde River.
00:19:02.041,00:19:03.541,Find its source.
00:19:04.583,00:19:08.458,It forms a critical part of the border between Bolivia and Brazil.
00:19:09.000,00:19:15.458,"Our survey route is to begin at a place called Fazenda Jacobina, which does not appear to be on this map."
00:19:15.791,00:19:16.833,I know Fazenda Jacobina.
00:19:17.500,00:19:20.833,It's an old rubber town. It's meant to be quite enchanting.
00:19:21.208,00:19:24.500,Really? You may not be completely useless after all.
00:19:26.000,00:19:28.125,Time is of the essence now.
00:19:29.416,00:19:30.750,War is at stake.
00:19:31.125,00:19:34.458,So you and I and a couple of mules are going to stop a war?
00:19:35.375,00:19:39.250,Well you and I... are going to have to depend on each other.
00:19:39.958,00:19:42.166,Neither of us will survive this alone.
00:19:42.666,00:19:43.833,Right you are.
00:19:47.916,00:19:49.083,What's that you're reading?
00:19:49.625,00:19:52.291,"A poem, from my wife, by Kipling."
00:19:53.000,00:19:54.500,It's called The Explorer.
00:19:54.958,00:19:56.041,Apt.
00:19:57.375,00:19:58.833,Would you like to hear it?
00:20:02.750,00:20:03.750,Be my guest.
00:20:06.291,00:20:37.333,"â€œThere's no sense in going further, it's the edge of cultivation, so they said, and I believed it, broke my land and sowed my crop, built my barns and strung my fences, Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable changes, on one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated, so..."
00:20:38.625,00:20:40.000,Something hidden.
00:20:40.791,00:20:42.125,Go and find it.
00:20:42.666,00:20:48.583,"Go and look behind the Ranges, Something lost behind the Ranges."
00:20:49.333,00:20:51.250,Lost and waiting for you.
00:20:52.083,00:20:53.166,Go!
00:21:45.500,00:21:47.750,Sixteen minutes south of the equator.
00:21:48.791,00:21:49.958,Twenty-nine.
00:21:51.708,00:21:52.708,Six...
00:21:53.833,00:21:54.958,Sixteen.
00:22:02.083,00:22:04.083,Rather deadly looking snake here.
00:22:08.208,00:22:10.541,We might be a little bit too English for this jungle.
00:23:51.833,00:23:52.833,Is that you?
00:23:53.958,00:23:56.500,-Yes. -Welcome to Fazenda Jacobina.
00:23:57.291,00:24:02.958,"Lance Corporal Manley, Sir, liaison to the Governor General-- No need to stand on ceremony. A simple handshake will suffice."
00:24:03.791,00:24:05.166,This is Mr. Costin.
00:24:05.583,00:24:07.416,I hate to be the bearer of bad news...
00:24:08.125,00:24:11.166,but I have received a telegram from the border commission.
00:24:13.250,00:24:17.083,They strongly advise you to... abort the mission.
00:24:17.833,00:24:19.750,"It's become far too dangerous, Sir."
00:24:19.875,00:24:22.291,-They've already fighting-- -Where are the government offices?
00:24:22.416,00:24:23.416,Sir...
00:24:25.125,00:24:26.125,"Government, Sir?"
00:24:28.291,00:24:31.166,I'm afraid you've left government behind a longtime ago.
00:24:32.791,00:24:35.458,"Well, in that case, you'd better send them a telegram..."
00:24:36.333,00:24:41.458,informing them that we will not stand down and we shall proceed as planned.
00:24:42.666,00:24:45.041,How quickly can you find us an Indian guide?
00:24:45.625,00:24:46.625,"Well, I..."
00:24:47.000,00:24:49.000,"I had an Indian guide Sir, but..."
00:24:50.791,00:24:52.208,But what happened to him?
00:24:58.041,00:24:59.250,"Not quite, Sir."
00:24:59.666,00:25:01.000,It's out of my hands now.
00:25:01.416,00:25:05.375,You need to speak to Baron De Gondoriz. He runs the rubber company here.
00:25:06.958,00:25:09.791,"Good evening, Baron. Thank you for seeing us."
00:25:10.750,00:25:12.541,We are from the British Army.
00:25:13.125,00:25:18.291,"We're to be venturing up the Rio Verde, and find ourselves in need of some of your men."
00:25:19.000,00:25:23.291,"In exchange, I promise very favorable treatment from my country."
00:25:47.875,00:25:49.458,"You goin' up river, are ya?"
00:25:52.333,00:25:53.333,Yes.
00:25:53.958,00:25:54.958,We're surveying.
00:25:55.791,00:25:56.791,Well...
00:25:58.458,00:26:00.750,Ain't nobody comes back from up there.
00:26:06.041,00:26:07.833,This slave good enough for you?
00:26:09.583,00:26:10.583,Yes.
00:26:20.583,00:26:24.166,What will you take for him? And any four men of his choosing?
00:26:26.291,00:26:28.875,It offends you to negotiate with me.
00:26:35.625,00:26:37.458,You come here to make maps.
00:26:38.125,00:26:39.333,Why is that?
00:26:40.000,00:26:42.208,So that there may be peace?
00:26:43.083,00:26:44.500,What is peace?
00:26:45.208,00:26:48.750,Peace means my business would flourish.
00:26:49.083,00:26:50.500,I would flourish.
00:27:00.416,00:27:04.333,Because you will make sure that nothing will change.
00:27:14.000,00:27:16.083,It came directly here while you were surveying.
00:27:43.500,00:27:45.583,Can you show me how far the river goes?
00:28:13.333,00:28:16.625,"They're as dependable as any that can be found here, Mr. Costin."
00:28:17.458,00:28:19.083,We're the only ones who will pay them.
00:28:20.333,00:28:23.458,We'll do twelve hours a day... no less.
00:29:49.291,00:29:50.916,"but, but I can't catch them."
00:30:04.500,00:30:06.833,The river is deep here. There is plenty of fish.
00:30:08.083,00:30:09.208,It's a desert.
00:30:10.666,00:30:11.958,A green desert.
00:30:13.583,00:30:14.791,"All right, pull it in."
00:30:15.791,00:30:17.333,Try again further up.
00:30:31.958,00:30:33.916,"Come to load rubber, no doubt."
00:30:49.250,00:30:50.666,There's someone aboard.
00:30:53.416,00:30:54.416,Hey!
00:31:17.083,00:31:18.916,Costin! Piranhas!
00:31:19.750,00:31:20.916,Get out of the water!
00:33:38.166,00:33:39.208,It's nothing.
00:34:02.666,00:34:04.125,Are we close?
00:35:27.458,00:35:29.916,Even the Indian's gone mad now.
00:35:34.750,00:35:37.875,He was talking to me about gold cities today.
00:35:46.708,00:35:49.541,Those Indians seemed a bit mad to begin with.
00:35:53.416,00:35:56.000,I'd like you to read this to me if you can.
00:36:06.125,00:36:09.333,I'm afraid it would be quite unbearable for me to read it myself.
00:36:14.625,00:36:16.125,"Right you are, Sir."
00:36:21.041,00:36:24.708,Your wife has moved the family to Devon.
00:36:25.791,00:36:29.000,She's given birth to a boy named Brian.
00:36:29.916,00:36:34.416,"Your oldest boy, Jack, is excelling in all ways, she says."
00:37:08.250,00:37:12.166,"What kind of fool am I, to leave my family for this place?"
00:37:16.791,00:37:19.208,What did you hope to achieve out here?
00:37:22.625,00:37:23.958,I don't know.
00:38:21.458,00:38:22.791,Food gone.
00:38:28.458,00:38:29.458,One piece.
00:38:34.416,00:38:35.416,Give me that!
00:38:43.750,00:38:45.541,We are not savages.
00:38:54.250,00:38:55.250,And for what'?
00:38:56.458,00:38:57.458,A map?
00:39:00.458,00:39:04.458,"Even if we get there, we're not making it back without any food."
00:39:06.750,00:39:08.083,Have you ever thought about that?
00:39:09.166,00:39:11.541,We're here starving to death.
00:39:16.333,00:39:17.708,Let's have at him.
00:39:20.791,00:39:24.875,Ah! My ear! My ear!
00:40:08.791,00:40:10.125,We made it!
00:40:32.625,00:40:34.208,"Major, we've lost the Indian."
00:40:39.791,00:40:41.166,He got us here.
00:41:33.625,00:41:38.375,-Am I dreaming this? -No... I see it too.
00:41:41.125,00:41:42.125,Please.
00:42:02.166,00:42:03.333,Thank God.
00:42:04.291,00:42:06.625,"Couldn't have done that better myself, Sir."
00:42:46.208,00:42:47.500,in the ground.
00:42:51.791,00:42:53.208,Look it's all over.
00:43:08.583,00:43:10.333,Christ. He was right.
00:43:13.625,00:43:15.375,The Indian was right.
00:43:17.958,00:43:20.000,You said no one had been here before.
00:43:21.416,00:43:26.083,I think you meant no white man Mr. Costin. I think you meant no white man.
00:43:32.333,00:43:34.208,There must've been dwellings here.
00:44:20.291,00:44:23.125,"The exit from hell is always difficult, Mr. Costin."
00:44:25.250,00:44:26.833,But we will get back.
00:44:30.000,00:44:32.458,The world will know what we've found here.
00:45:35.250,00:45:36.458,Thank you. Thank you.
00:45:39.458,00:45:40.541,"Thank you, Sir."
00:45:55.083,00:45:56.583,This must be Brian.
00:46:05.625,00:46:07.041,Are you my father?
00:46:08.625,00:46:10.416,"I am, indeed, son."
00:46:11.500,00:46:13.666,"Come, give me a hug."
00:46:21.750,00:46:22.958,Let's go home.
00:46:25.000,00:46:26.208,Thank you all.
00:46:32.958,00:46:36.291,"Percy, come. Meet our host, Mr. James Murray."
00:46:36.416,00:46:38.375,He's very anxious to meet you.
00:46:38.625,00:46:41.000,A person of considerable resources.
00:46:41.250,00:46:43.458,He certainly has a beautiful home.
00:46:50.333,00:46:52.833,"Major Fawcett, I see you down there."
00:46:56.666,00:46:58.041,"Thank, Mr. Murray."
00:47:11.875,00:47:13.333,"Listen to them, will you?"
00:47:20.375,00:47:22.166,"I'm just honored to be here, Sir."
00:47:22.791,00:47:25.541,I read your article in The Times this morning...
00:47:25.666,00:47:30.041,about the... slave trade in the Americas. It's uh...
00:47:31.041,00:47:32.666,You're an enlightened man.
00:47:36.041,00:47:39.041,The native does deserve our sympathy.
00:47:40.583,00:47:44.250,I think we have only just scratched the surface of Amazonia.
00:47:47.000,00:47:48.541,"I was, um..."
00:47:48.958,00:47:54.458,"Well, I'm a biologist, but I'm also somewhat of an explorer."
00:47:54.583,00:47:58.291,I was second in command under Shackleton in the Antarctica.
00:47:59.625,00:48:04.208,"I don't think there's anyone here who's not well aware of your accomplishments, Mr. Murray."
00:48:04.333,00:48:05.250,"Here, here."
00:48:11.041,00:48:13.583,"Well, it's been my lifelong ambition to..."
00:48:14.625,00:48:16.333,"go to the Amazon, you know?"
00:48:17.583,00:48:23.250,"Well, I must say, I hope that the RGS continues its pursuits, but I..."
00:48:23.708,00:48:28.375,I have come to believe that mapmaking should be a secondary interest.
00:48:29.416,00:48:30.416,Really?
00:48:30.875,00:48:37.791,"I witnessed several archaeological discoveries, that I believe may have enormous significance."
00:48:44.416,00:48:46.416,"My friend, a word in your ear, please."
00:48:46.541,00:48:50.500,"Um, your, your exploits have opened every door for you."
00:48:51.208,00:48:53.958,But I would suggest keeping such findings to yourself.
00:48:54.083,00:48:54.916,Mm-hmm.
00:49:02.250,00:49:07.041,"I mean, no one here would dispute that you believed what you saw, but..."
00:49:07.625,00:49:10.041,such a trip is very hard on the mind...
00:49:10.500,00:49:12.208,"very hard, indeed."
00:49:16.291,00:49:17.666,Mr. Keltie.
00:49:19.500,00:49:22.666,I think you should find my mind perfectly fit.
00:49:24.666,00:49:26.916,"And still open, thank heavens."
00:49:44.791,00:49:48.166,I would like to introduce one of our brothers...
00:49:48.500,00:49:54.000,whose achievements are now known to you... and not inconsiderable.
00:49:54.750,00:49:57.250,Major Percy Fawcett.
00:50:01.000,00:50:02.125,"Thank you, Sir."
00:50:08.291,00:50:10.583,"By rights, I should be with my husband."
00:50:10.791,00:50:13.083,"It's, it's men only I'm afraid, madam."
00:50:18.250,00:50:20.958,it is now my firm belief...
00:50:21.500,00:50:27.625,"that Amazonia, is far more than the green desert which many of us had supposed."
00:50:30.250,00:50:34.000,I am proposing that Amazonia...
00:50:34.541,00:50:37.250,contain a hidden civilization...
00:50:45.750,00:50:50.500,"I am Mr. William Barkley of Bedford, and I have been to South America."
00:50:52.666,00:50:56.333,"Please, Mr. Barkley, I'm sure we'd all be thrilled to hear about your holiday."
00:50:58.916,00:51:02.291,But we are currently discussing exploration.
00:51:06.458,00:51:10.166,Are you insisting on mythical kingdoms of gold?
00:51:12.958,00:51:16.083,lured the conquistadors to their destruction.
00:51:17.875,00:51:23.875,"Sir, it was the conquistadors and we, who have been destroying Amazonia."
00:51:25.416,00:51:30.291,"I have seen, with my own eyes, evidence of their civilization."
00:51:30.458,00:51:33.583,"And I assure you, Sir, it is real."
00:51:36.166,00:51:39.291,Perhaps it is too difficult for some of you to admit.
00:51:40.958,00:51:49.875,"We, who have been steeped in the bigotry of the church for so long, cannot give much credence to an older civilization."
00:51:50.416,00:51:57.458,Particularly one created by a race the white man has so brutally condemned to slavery and death.
00:51:58.000,00:52:03.208,"Are, are you insisting that these savages, they're our equals?"
00:52:03.625,00:52:07.791,"I do not know, Mr. Barkley, but I intend to find out."
00:52:20.458,00:52:23.125,If we may find a city...
00:52:23.583,00:52:26.833,where one was considered impossible to exist...
00:52:27.125,00:52:32.000,It may well write a whole new chapter in human history.
00:52:32.500,00:52:34.750,Yes! Yes!
00:52:37.541,00:52:40.000,I have archaeological finds.
00:52:41.333,00:52:46.500,Antiquities as sophisticated as any in Asia or Europe...
00:52:47.500,00:52:49.875,in the middle of the jungle!
00:52:54.041,00:52:55.416,Pots and pans!
00:52:55.833,00:52:58.041,Pans! Pots and pans!
00:53:14.916,00:53:22.791,"After my return from the jungle, I have examined a single document, dating from the conquistadors, Mr. Barkley!"
00:53:24.750,00:53:29.208,It states explicitly the discovery of a lost city.
00:53:31.416,00:53:36.708,"Uncovered in Trinity College, Dublin, this week by my lovely wife."
00:53:38.583,00:53:43.875,"Written by a Spanish soldier in 1753, and I quote..."
00:53:45.125,00:53:50.208,We came upon the ruins of an ancient city bedecked with gold.
00:53:50.791,00:53:51.833,Roads...
00:53:52.416,00:53:53.416,Temples...
00:53:53.958,00:53:55.416,Ancient symbols...
00:54:02.875,00:54:06.000,The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!
00:54:06.458,00:54:10.250,It is there and we must find it!
00:54:10.583,00:54:11.875,Mr. Fawcett!
00:54:13.583,00:54:17.375,"Mr. Fawcett, I say we return!"
00:54:24.208,00:54:26.125,"What I say, Mr. Murray..."
00:54:27.208,00:54:29.416,is I accept that challenge!
00:54:34.166,00:54:35.833,I see you seated there.
00:54:39.291,00:54:40.291,Mr. Fawcett.
00:54:41.000,00:54:44.041,"That jungle is hell, but... one kind of likes it."
00:54:46.666,00:54:48.083,We shall return!
00:55:05.958,00:55:12.875,"With this journey, we may be able to tear down their narrow minded convictions."
00:55:16.958,00:55:21.250,I do believe I am quite ready to accompany on your next journey.
00:55:28.041,00:55:29.416,What do you mean?
00:55:32.833,00:55:35.166,The children will be back in school by then.
00:55:37.250,00:55:39.250,And I have learned to read the stars...
00:55:40.625,00:55:41.916,and navigate.
00:55:43.958,00:55:46.916,And I've become very well versed in the history of the region.
00:55:49.291,00:55:51.458,"After all, it is I who found the document."
00:55:56.083,00:55:57.916,But that would be impossible.
00:56:00.083,00:56:02.625,It's not a place at all for a woman.
00:56:05.375,00:56:07.125,Not a place for a woman?!
00:56:09.250,00:56:12.041,We believe firmly in the equality between us.
00:56:12.166,00:56:15.375,"In equality, yes, but in mind, not in body."
00:56:15.500,00:56:16.500,Ah.
00:56:16.791,00:56:20.666,The rigor of such a trip would be beyond your imagination.
00:56:20.958,00:56:26.708,I believe it is generally acknowledged that the pain a woman experiences during childbirth far exceeds anything a man must endure.
00:56:26.833,00:56:30.333,"-This is not about childbirth. -Oh, what would you know of childbirth?"
00:56:30.958,00:56:33.875,"Have you witnessed two minutes of it, let alone endured it?"
00:56:37.166,00:56:38.458,The jungle...
00:56:39.166,00:56:42.416,is about years of practice...
00:56:43.416,00:56:46.500,"training, the art of soldiering."
00:56:47.583,00:56:49.083,I have that.
00:56:49.791,00:56:56.333,It is about maggots in your skin. It is about deadly snakes and disease that make you vomit blood.
00:56:57.916,00:56:59.625,You could not bear it.
00:57:00.458,00:57:02.791,And I could not bear that either.
00:57:02.916,00:57:06.791,Somehow I managed to bear the dangers you faced the years you were gone.
00:57:07.000,00:57:09.125,"This way, at least, we me might be together for some of our lives!"
00:57:09.208,00:57:10.541,You are my wife!
00:57:13.375,00:57:14.583,I need you here.
00:57:20.291,00:57:23.458,"And in this fantasy of yours, what happens to the children?"
00:57:25.791,00:57:28.250,"Please, try to be reasonable."
00:57:30.625,00:57:33.291,You will throw reasonable in my face.
00:57:33.958,00:57:38.666,Was it reasonable to stay here and struggle to provide for the children while you wandered the jungle?
00:57:40.250,00:57:44.250,"Now you have given no thought, not one thought, to my aspirations as a woman."
00:57:45.041,00:57:46.375,Have you thought about that?
00:57:46.500,00:57:51.375,Men and women have performed their roles since the beginning of time!
00:57:57.500,00:57:59.666,and I am disgraced by your ignorant posture!
00:57:59.791,00:58:00.625,Mother!
00:58:00.750,00:58:01.791,"It's all right, darling."
00:58:05.625,00:58:07.000,"It's all right, Jack. Go."
00:58:46.291,00:58:47.708,You should put some grease on that.
00:58:49.416,00:58:50.416,Will do.
00:58:52.416,00:58:53.750,Where's Mr. Murray?
00:58:54.458,00:58:56.125,"He's bringing up the rear, chief."
00:58:58.083,00:58:59.291,Mr. Murray!
00:59:02.125,00:59:03.083,How are you managing?
00:59:03.750,00:59:06.333,"I am managing well, thank you."
00:59:07.333,00:59:11.083,My pack is just a little heavy it seems.
00:59:11.958,00:59:13.458,Perhaps I shall...
00:59:14.166,00:59:18.166,"rid myself of the unnecessary accoutrements, yes?"
00:59:18.791,00:59:20.500,I wouldn't do that if I were you.
00:59:25.291,00:59:26.291,However...
00:59:27.458,00:59:28.958,an awful lot of this...
00:59:29.541,00:59:33.541,scientific equipment seems to be slowing us down.
00:59:34.916,00:59:36.291,When we reach the river then.
00:59:37.500,00:59:39.791,But you must keep one spare set of clothing.
00:59:40.416,00:59:41.916,"And, of course, your mattress."
00:59:47.791,00:59:49.208,What a site that would be.
00:59:50.000,00:59:51.250,Let's keep going.
00:59:52.166,00:59:54.333,That bugger wishes he was back on the South Pole.
00:59:56.000,00:59:58.666,He'll pull his weight soon enough. Don't worry.
01:00:10.833,01:00:13.833,"You've got two from your wife and son, Major."
01:00:18.291,01:00:20.166,There's been a major discovery in Peru.
01:00:22.291,01:00:23.916,"Oh, and an American..."
01:00:24.458,01:00:29.458,"Hiram Bingham, he's found the lost city in the Andes, Machu Picchu."
01:00:43.041,01:00:44.333,He's too far north.
01:00:50.500,01:00:52.125,We've lost the other boat.
01:00:58.000,01:00:59.125,Savages!
01:00:59.458,01:01:01.708,-Arm yourselves! -No! Hold your fire.
01:01:02.916,01:01:04.125,Everyone out of the boat.
01:01:21.791,01:01:22.875,Mr. Manley!
01:01:23.291,01:01:24.708,Get your concertina.
01:01:24.875,01:01:26.750,"-My concertina, Sir? -Yes, do it now!"
01:01:26.875,01:01:28.500,Play Soldiers of the Queen!
01:01:32.458,01:01:34.166,"Mr. Costin, come and sing with me."
01:01:41.750,01:01:42.750,Are you ready?
01:03:59.583,01:04:00.791,If the red man attacks.
01:04:02.000,01:04:03.333,You rally to me at all costs.
01:04:19.666,01:04:21.750,"Oh, good God..."
01:05:00.833,01:05:01.833,We are safe.
01:05:02.791,01:05:05.666,The chief has invited us to be his guest.
01:05:34.625,01:05:35.833,I know. I know.
01:05:37.625,01:05:41.250,The chief explained it's a dead member of their tribe.
01:05:41.958,01:05:45.083,His spirit will enter them if they eat it.
01:05:46.250,01:05:48.458,We must attempt to engage.
01:05:50.916,01:05:55.416,They may have critical information about our destination.
01:05:55.541,01:05:57.750,I'm... I refuse this madness.
01:05:58.458,01:05:59.458,I refuse it.
01:08:09.375,01:08:12.166,"He's heard rumors of a city, but he's not sure."
01:08:12.750,01:08:16.166,He said further up the river he thinks there will be people who can help us.
01:08:19.166,01:08:20.166,"All right, then."
01:09:11.000,01:09:12.583,That is remarkable.
01:10:14.166,01:10:16.541,It's mathematical in its precision.
01:10:31.958,01:10:34.083,Imagine what Z must be like.
01:10:46.291,01:10:47.708,We leave at sunrise.
01:11:15.333,01:11:16.583,James?!
01:11:18.666,01:11:19.666,James?!
01:11:35.041,01:11:36.458,"Hello, old sport."
01:11:38.916,01:11:41.458,I appear to have gotten myself lost.
01:11:45.125,01:11:48.125,cannibalized by those... savages.
01:11:58.500,01:12:00.916,You'll be looked after. Come.
01:12:04.250,01:12:07.000,I think I have a bit of a fever coming on.
01:12:07.125,01:12:09.333,"Manley, help me clean all of this up."
01:12:29.833,01:12:34.416,It was a gift from my wife and children for all of us to share.
01:12:35.666,01:12:37.625,I know. I was just very...
01:12:38.958,01:12:40.083,hungry.
01:12:43.416,01:12:48.708,I'm a little bit tired. If you don't mind I'm going to rest for a... while longer.
01:12:52.833,01:12:58.041,"My own children, at their tender ages, could be counted on more than you."
01:13:00.083,01:13:03.125,And I could be home... with them.
01:13:04.625,01:13:07.125,"And yet, I am here with you..."
01:13:08.166,01:13:10.500,to attempt great things.
01:13:12.375,01:13:14.000,Have you water please?
01:13:14.750,01:13:16.791,You'll get water when we get to the raft.
01:13:16.916,01:13:19.875,"Mr. Manley, help me get him on his feet."
01:13:25.250,01:13:27.125,"Stay where you are, Mr. Murray."
01:13:27.750,01:13:29.666,It's essential we keep the balance.
01:13:31.958,01:13:32.916,Murray!
01:13:37.291,01:13:39.500,"Stay down, God damn you!"
01:13:44.625,01:13:45.625,Swim to shore!
01:14:02.083,01:14:04.625,We're losing supplies! God damn you!
01:14:09.333,01:14:10.708,"Mr. Manley, help me!"
01:14:26.041,01:14:29.750,Chief! We've lost a third of our rations.
01:14:41.083,01:14:43.416,And this after you stole our food!
01:14:44.333,01:14:46.791,I suppose I should have starved myself.
01:14:46.916,01:14:49.666,"That would have been the honorable course of action, wouldn't it?"
01:15:01.291,01:15:03.208,I just want to be dead.
01:15:10.000,01:15:14.541,young upstart and his vulgar quest for glory...
01:15:16.750,01:15:18.750,Like a Judas...
01:15:19.666,01:15:21.666,he has delivered me...
01:15:24.208,01:15:25.583,into this...
01:15:26.291,01:15:27.375,jungle.
01:15:28.958,01:15:30.583,"Well, we're two weeks behind..."
01:15:31.333,01:15:33.583,according to the sextant and the charts.
01:15:37.416,01:15:38.416,Chief.
01:15:49.875,01:15:51.208,I noticed.
01:16:09.333,01:16:11.333,the hem of your garment...
01:16:12.083,01:16:13.083,As I...
01:16:13.916,01:16:16.166,am not worthy of yours.
01:16:25.416,01:16:27.458,No... No...
01:16:41.583,01:16:42.916,Yes? What is it'?
01:16:49.458,01:16:52.500,There are mining encampments south of us on the river.
01:16:54.750,01:16:57.000,"In the morning, you'll be on your way to them."
01:17:00.666,01:17:03.791,with what supplies I can spare and an Indian to guide you.
01:17:05.750,01:17:07.625,I have a family at home.
01:17:08.625,01:17:13.291,I cannot allow you to jeopardize the welfare of the entire crew.
01:17:16.666,01:17:19.333,You don't give a wit about me...
01:17:20.333,01:17:22.750,or about any of the party.
01:17:25.958,01:17:28.625,You don't even care about going home.
01:17:31.166,01:17:32.250,You only care...
01:17:33.625,01:17:35.208,about your lost...
01:17:36.416,01:17:37.416,city.
01:18:13.250,01:18:15.583,I'm going to see if there's a path through!
01:18:53.666,01:18:54.750,I saw it!
01:18:55.625,01:18:56.916,We're getting close!
01:18:58.291,01:18:59.500,Keep going!
01:19:15.791,01:19:17.333,And this is how he repays us.
01:19:19.958,01:19:23.125,Rations ruined! Murray's covered them in oil!
01:19:23.250,01:19:24.208,Look at it!
01:19:38.333,01:19:40.583,There is no turning back.
01:19:42.458,01:19:44.416,We are right here!
01:19:47.791,01:19:50.291,We've nothing to show for our efforts.
01:19:53.125,01:19:56.083,"With what we have on our backs, we'll last a week at most!"
01:19:57.666,01:19:59.125,"It's over, Percy!"
01:20:29.750,01:20:36.166,"Mr. James Murray was forced to separate from our expedition, to seek medical attention."
01:20:42.458,01:20:44.708,and he has most likely perished.
01:20:46.708,01:20:50.833,The rest of the group shall arrive back in England...
01:20:51.583,01:20:53.458,as soon as is possible.
01:21:02.833,01:21:04.333,It looks like a war with France.
01:21:04.875,01:21:07.125,Better all get home or we'll miss our chance to fight.
01:21:10.958,01:21:12.583,Please send that immediately.
01:21:13.416,01:21:14.500,"Yes, Sir."
01:21:29.541,01:21:31.083,Beautiful child.
01:21:53.916,01:21:56.000,-I'll fetch the boys. -No.
01:21:58.416,01:21:59.750,Let them finish.
01:22:00.791,01:22:02.583,"When they're done, send them in."
01:22:06.458,01:22:08.833,It should be I who tells them what has happened.
01:22:22.000,01:22:23.166,You're real.
01:23:02.125,01:23:04.208,Thank you for coming at such short notice.
01:23:06.583,01:23:08.416,"Please, will you step this way?"
01:23:12.500,01:23:14.208,Congratulations on your knighthood.
01:23:14.333,01:23:16.708,"Ah, thank you. I think that you know everybody here."
01:23:18.833,01:23:22.041,Mr. James Murray arrived in London just this morning.
01:23:35.333,01:23:37.541,Congratulations on your safe return.
01:23:40.000,01:23:42.000,It's a remarkable effort.
01:23:47.250,01:23:48.875,No. It is not.
01:23:49.125,01:23:51.625,He was given money and food.
01:23:52.458,01:23:56.583,It was an unfortunate but necessary maneuver in order to save lives.
01:23:57.750,01:23:59.208,We spent all our time...
01:24:00.750,01:24:04.166,playing around in the mud with the savages.
01:24:06.500,01:24:09.375,And I never saw any evidence of a lost city.
01:24:10.666,01:24:15.541,"You were the reason we did not reach our destination, Mr. Murray."
01:24:15.958,01:24:18.166,You poured paraffin on all our supplies.
01:24:30.000,01:24:35.625,And as for his lackeys... they are swine and not to be trusted.
01:24:35.916,01:24:38.791,You should've been beaten in the jungle like the dog that you are.
01:24:40.541,01:24:42.375,Our nation is now at war.
01:24:42.750,01:24:46.916,It ill becomes us to indulge personal conflicts.
01:24:47.125,01:24:50.416,I earnestly beseech you to come to an understanding.
01:24:54.208,01:24:55.208,Very well.
01:24:57.125,01:24:59.416,I most generously offer that...
01:25:00.166,01:25:06.750,If you are willing to apologize to me here in front of this entire society...
01:25:07.500,01:25:12.875,I will consider withdrawing my claims against the RGS and yourself...
01:25:13.375,01:25:15.625,"with certain conditions, of course."
01:25:16.791,01:25:17.791,"Well, Major."
01:25:18.916,01:25:20.416,Will you apologize?
01:25:23.500,01:25:25.375,For the general good...
01:25:26.750,01:25:28.916,I am prepared to reconcile.
01:25:30.833,01:25:34.875,"I will, of course, need to hear Mr. Murray's conditions."
01:25:35.750,01:25:40.000,On the day that I agreed to join you on your mission...
01:25:40.458,01:25:47.208,"and allowed your star to enter my sphere, your wife was present to witness your ascent."
01:25:47.958,01:25:58.166,"My only condition is that she again be present to witness your acknowledgment, of the wrongs..."
01:26:00.125,01:26:01.875,that you have done to me.
01:26:02.750,01:26:03.750,Sir.
01:26:06.000,01:26:11.458,"The last time I saw you, I was putting you on the only remaining horse..."
01:26:12.125,01:26:15.375,giving you far more than your share of our food.
01:26:15.666,01:26:21.291,The men begged me to leave you where you lay...
01:26:21.833,01:26:23.833,but I could not do that.
01:26:24.250,01:26:29.041,"And as a consequence, I saved your life."
01:26:29.166,01:26:30.916,You saved my life?
01:26:33.375,01:26:35.208,I demand an apology right now.
01:26:35.625,01:26:37.375,You will apologize to me.
01:26:40.750,01:26:42.416,I will apologize...
01:26:43.291,01:26:44.458,Thank you.
01:26:48.125,01:26:49.375,to my men.
01:26:52.333,01:26:57.500,I'm sorry I ever considered Mr. Murray worthy of your company.
01:26:58.041,01:27:03.208,And as I ever mistook a man's rank for his mettle.
01:27:03.875,01:27:06.625,But I shall not make that mistake again.
01:27:09.958,01:27:14.208,"What your purpose is in this ambush, I cannot say."
01:27:19.583,01:27:22.458,I hereby resign from this institution...
01:27:22.666,01:27:24.708,and I shall proceed on my own.
01:27:24.833,01:27:26.208,"No, p-please, Major! Please!"
01:27:26.458,01:27:29.500,"This is outrageous! Please, you must reconsider!"
01:27:30.833,01:27:31.916,Magnus!
01:27:34.500,01:27:36.000,I shall teach him.
01:28:02.208,01:28:03.208,What's wrong?
01:28:05.000,01:28:06.333,You've received a letter.
01:28:07.833,01:28:12.208,"All former officers not currently posted, must send their names to the war office."
01:28:17.208,01:28:19.083,Let us hope it is a brief conflict.
01:28:23.291,01:28:24.500,Talk to the boys.
01:28:24.750,01:28:26.666,"Don't be concerned, my love."
01:28:28.916,01:28:31.375,I've spent a whole life training for this.
01:28:43.333,01:28:44.500,Father...
01:28:48.041,01:28:49.041,Jack.
01:28:49.416,01:28:50.416,Brian.
01:28:56.333,01:28:57.416,I'll do it.
01:28:58.916,01:29:00.958,"Father, you will not have to leave again, will you?"
01:29:05.041,01:29:08.083,"If the reports are true, I'm afraid I must."
01:29:09.083,01:29:10.750,"Father, you've only just returned."
01:29:11.458,01:29:13.000,It's... it's hardly fair.
01:29:14.125,01:29:15.791,I'm obligated to serve.
01:29:18.750,01:29:20.833,What of your obligation to mother?
01:29:21.625,01:29:23.041,And to us?
01:29:23.500,01:29:24.708,Your family.
01:29:26.000,01:29:29.208,The... the family that you've chosen to abandon for so many years.
01:29:33.416,01:29:35.708,How dare you talk to me like that.
01:29:37.750,01:29:40.541,"How dare... How dare you, father you..."
01:29:41.833,01:29:43.166,You do not think of us.
01:29:47.083,01:29:49.125,or any other path to glory that you can find.
01:29:49.250,01:29:50.166,"Jack, stop it! That's enough!"
01:29:50.291,01:29:53.166,"Mother, I will not stop. You have returned a failure."
01:29:56.791,01:29:57.875,-It's contemptible-- -Enough!
01:30:15.291,01:30:20.333,"Everything your father has done, since the day you came into this world, has been to better your life."
01:30:22.708,01:30:24.833,you will come regret the things you just said to him.
01:31:10.125,01:31:13.625,It appears our old friend Mr. James Murray is not so powerful after all.
01:31:14.541,01:31:15.833,Why do you say that?
01:31:15.958,01:31:21.500,The bastard's gone off on an Artic expedition with Canadians and... mutinied.
01:31:25.500,01:31:26.500,Take a look.
01:31:38.083,01:31:44.083,Someone should warn the Eskimos that Mr. Murray is on the prowl.
01:32:11.041,01:32:14.375,"Times up, let's make the Major do it. Come on!"
01:32:25.625,01:32:27.625,"There will be in battle soon, madam."
01:32:28.333,01:32:31.541,Any spiritual aid would be greatly appreciated.
01:32:33.708,01:32:35.291,You are the explorer?
01:32:38.208,01:32:39.208,I was.
01:32:41.791,01:32:43.458,I was with these fine men...
01:32:44.333,01:32:47.375,who have transferred here so we could all be together.
01:32:53.333,01:32:54.833,Give me your hand.
01:33:13.000,01:33:16.458,Is it... a forest?
01:33:16.625,01:33:19.958,You dream to be in a forest.
01:33:23.583,01:33:26.208,I wish to find a lost city.
01:33:29.000,01:33:31.666,see yourself there now?
01:33:32.500,01:33:35.125,Try to picture it in your mind.
01:33:47.250,01:33:48.750,I can see it.
01:33:58.791,01:34:00.208,is far greater...
01:34:00.833,01:34:03.708,than you ever imagined.
01:34:22.458,01:34:25.958,It is your destiny.
01:34:38.250,01:34:41.333,Our whole world has set itself afire...
01:34:44.416,01:34:48.125,We must look elsewhere to quench the blaze.
01:35:16.541,01:35:17.958,"Good morning, gentlemen."
01:35:25.791,01:35:27.375,When I was younger...
01:35:28.958,01:35:31.375,I ventured all for king and country...
01:35:32.666,01:35:34.500,for place and rank.
01:35:37.083,01:35:39.750,I believed that to be the makings of a man.
01:35:42.916,01:35:45.250,But my travels have taught me...
01:35:46.166,01:35:48.291,such ambitions...
01:35:49.708,01:35:51.375,are mere phantoms.
01:35:58.166,01:36:01.875,"we fight for our loves ones, as we should."
01:36:04.458,01:36:05.916,But they are not here.
01:36:07.750,01:36:10.291,So instead let us fight for each other.
01:36:16.458,01:36:17.541,Good luck.
01:36:20.291,01:36:23.041,And may God be with all of you.
01:36:28.583,01:36:30.708,Alright men! Into positions!
01:37:44.416,01:37:47.041,Come on! Push forward!
01:38:00.500,01:38:01.375,Gas!
01:38:03.333,01:38:04.541,Gas!
01:38:06.166,01:38:07.166,Gas!
01:38:12.791,01:38:15.666,Manley! Gas! Manley!
01:39:50.125,01:39:51.416,We are here.
01:39:53.291,01:39:54.791,The children are here.
01:40:00.791,01:40:01.791,Come.
01:40:05.916,01:40:07.000,That is Joan.
01:40:11.083,01:40:13.916,Let him feel your face. Come along.
01:40:15.583,01:40:16.583,See?
01:40:18.833,01:40:20.250,Where's Jack'?
01:40:24.500,01:40:25.708,"Father, I'm here."
01:40:29.916,01:40:32.208,I thought I had died.
01:40:36.500,01:40:38.916,You were exposed to chlorine gas.
01:40:39.791,01:40:44.208,"Your eyes were affected, but they are very confident that your sight shall return."
01:40:47.000,01:40:48.625,The rest of the men?
01:40:50.458,01:40:53.166,-Costin? -Mr. Costin was unharmed.
01:40:57.708,01:41:00.083,but it was the only one that did not retreat.
01:41:01.125,01:41:04.458,"Thanks to you bravery, they are raising your rank to Lieutenant Colonel."
01:41:05.958,01:41:07.375,Lieutenant Colonel?
01:41:08.000,01:41:09.291,After all that he has done?
01:41:10.000,01:41:11.000,Jack.
01:41:19.458,01:41:21.500,about Amazonia.
01:41:23.375,01:41:27.166,I'm afraid you may never be able to return to your jungle.
01:41:44.333,01:41:46.958,You cannot think of these things right now.
01:41:48.083,01:41:50.041,I'm going to take the children for some air.
01:42:14.833,01:42:15.833,Father.
01:42:18.333,01:42:19.333,Jack.
01:42:59.291,01:43:02.166,Our readers have been asking where you've been since the war.
01:43:06.333,01:43:11.416,You may tell your readers I've recovered from my wounds and have been adapting to home life.
01:43:14.583,01:43:20.000,Your pursuits in South America have led to a tremendous interest in exploration in the Unites States.
01:43:20.125,01:43:21.916,There have been many new voyages planned.
01:43:23.166,01:43:24.166,Have there?
01:43:24.583,01:43:29.541,"Yes, Dr. Hamilton Rice leaves for Brazil soon with radio and airplanes."
01:43:29.666,01:43:32.333,He's taking a large and very well-armed party.
01:43:34.666,01:43:40.208,"Well, let us hope that Dr. Rice, with all his arms, does not destroy what he wishes to discover."
01:43:47.000,01:43:48.541,How did you find us here?
01:43:49.125,01:43:50.416,"Well, your son, Colonel."
01:43:51.000,01:43:52.333,He wrote us a letter.
01:44:20.458,01:44:21.708,"Thank you, father."
01:44:26.666,01:44:28.500,"Practice makes perfect, you know?"
01:45:01.291,01:45:02.916,I have something for you.
01:45:06.083,01:45:10.583,This was given to me... by a Guarayo Indian chief.
01:45:11.708,01:45:12.875,A great man.
01:45:14.666,01:45:15.833,It's yours now.
01:45:23.250,01:45:24.166,Thank you.
01:45:27.666,01:45:29.416,It must've been a glorious day.
01:45:37.750,01:45:39.416,"You still believe in Z, do you not?"
01:45:42.250,01:45:44.083,That we underestimated the Indian?
01:45:48.166,01:45:49.666,That is why we should go back.
01:45:53.083,01:45:56.125,"You and I, together. We could find the city once and for all."
01:46:04.458,01:46:05.583,Jack...
01:46:08.291,01:46:10.083,I'm an old bastard now.
01:46:15.041,01:46:18.166,"Father, you and I, we both know it. You easily outmatch my strengths."
01:46:19.833,01:46:21.875,And now you can see as clear as day again.
01:46:22.666,01:46:24.375,There is nothing stopping us.
01:46:29.166,01:46:30.125,Father.
01:46:31.541,01:46:33.750,The Americans will venture there with their guns.
01:46:35.208,01:46:38.208,And then we must pray that they do not destroy the Indian.
01:46:47.666,01:46:49.666,"I want nothing more than to go with you, Father."
01:46:51.166,01:46:52.791,It's everything you've always wanted.
01:47:03.291,01:47:05.791,We would have to consult a higher authority.
01:47:10.916,01:47:16.291,"But you've said so yourself with everything that's happened in Europe, it's not possible to choose a safe passage through life."
01:47:16.833,01:47:19.875,So many men near my own age did not return from the war.
01:47:20.208,01:47:22.625,And who is to say it will not happen again?
01:47:23.375,01:47:25.000,"It could, mother."
01:47:25.916,01:47:27.166,It could happen again.
01:47:28.833,01:47:31.583,"By all accounts, I should be furious because you've just..."
01:47:32.666,01:47:35.250,You've just used my very own words against me.
01:47:37.041,01:47:39.166,And how can I refute them? They are my own.
01:47:41.000,01:47:42.333,"All right, Joan, don't slap him."
01:47:42.666,01:47:44.875,Thank you. Off! Go on!
01:47:45.041,01:47:46.250,She hit me on the face.
01:47:46.375,01:47:48.416,Brian! I'm in the middle of a conversation!
01:47:48.541,01:47:51.083,"Go and help you sister get some wood, please, from the log pile now."
01:47:51.208,01:47:52.041,Now!
01:47:52.458,01:47:53.833,Fight your own battles!
01:48:01.583,01:48:02.625,"Mother, please..."
01:48:17.250,01:48:19.875,There is little doubt that I would worry night and day...
01:48:21.041,01:48:22.833,about my boys in the jungle.
01:48:29.875,01:48:32.375,But we have never let fear determine our future.
01:48:35.208,01:48:36.208,That's all.
01:48:40.833,01:48:42.041,"Mother, thank you."
01:48:43.208,01:48:44.625,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
01:48:48.833,01:48:51.291,"-Father, this-- -Jack, Jack, Jack."
01:48:51.500,01:48:53.458,-We are not there yet. -I know.
01:48:53.583,01:48:55.166,We'll have to raise a great deal of money.
01:48:59.083,01:49:00.750,Go on. Let me talk to your mother.
01:49:02.791,01:49:04.750,"Well, of course, I shall begin right away."
01:49:05.458,01:49:08.291,"You and I, and Mr. Costin I'm sure would love to join us."
01:49:09.583,01:49:11.166,"Thank you, mother. Thank you."
01:49:19.125,01:49:20.250,What?
01:49:21.958,01:49:24.500,I'm just surprised you agreed so quickly.
01:49:26.583,01:49:28.041,What choice did I have?
01:49:29.958,01:49:32.958,"It's his essential nature, would be wrong to betray that."
01:49:34.791,01:49:36.958,"Besides, you will be there to guide him."
01:49:43.958,01:49:45.500,These are the last of my notebooks.
01:49:46.500,01:49:47.958,I hope they'll be helpful.
01:49:55.583,01:49:57.750,Can I truly not persuade you to come?
01:50:05.916,01:50:07.958,Think of what it would mean...
01:50:09.250,01:50:11.333,To finally find it together.
01:50:13.416,01:50:16.875,"Chief, I have a wife and child now."
01:50:23.583,01:50:27.541,My own children were younger than yours is now when we went on our first trip.
01:50:29.666,01:50:31.708,Can't say it was not a sacrifice.
01:50:34.833,01:50:37.041,But if you could see my boy now...
01:50:37.583,01:50:39.500,his vim and vigor...
01:50:41.208,01:50:45.250,I guarantee it would tear down your resistance in an instant.
01:50:48.916,01:50:50.583,"Nope. Thank you, Nigel."
01:50:53.291,01:50:55.375,"Chief, please don't misunderstand me. I'm..."
01:50:58.666,01:51:00.166,"this, I believe..."
01:51:01.750,01:51:04.083,this search for Z...
01:51:06.833,01:51:09.000,I can no longer bear the cost.
01:51:17.958,01:51:20.125,You've come to doubt its existence?
01:51:20.916,01:51:21.916,No.
01:51:22.958,01:51:26.083,I only doubt that Z could provide all the answers you seek from it.
01:51:28.500,01:51:30.875,"I wish you success, my dear friend."
01:51:36.166,01:51:38.250,Top heavy missions get nowhere.
01:51:38.750,01:51:44.125,They linger on the fringe of civilization and bask in publicity... We will not.
01:51:44.500,01:51:46.583,We will be in the field for three years...
01:51:49.958,01:51:51.833,surviving by our wits.
01:51:52.666,01:51:58.333,Tribesmen shall take our dispatchers to be delivered for publication as often as possible.
01:51:58.458,01:52:01.541,But who's going to finance this latest journey of yours?
01:52:01.750,01:52:09.458,"The money is generously being supplied by a consortium of American newspapers, and Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr."
01:52:10.750,01:52:15.166,"Are you aware, The Royal Geographical Society, has just offered to help with the financing?"
01:52:15.458,01:52:18.041,I'm glad to see our nation is not to be left behind.
01:52:19.458,01:52:26.875,"I would like now to introduce my companion for this historic expedition, my own son, Mr. Jack Fawcett."
01:52:36.958,01:52:41.291,"No, but I am proud to say that we did finally manage to meet them halfway."
01:52:42.500,01:52:47.000,"Sir George, God rest his soul, always bore you great affection."
01:52:47.583,01:52:52.250,But I admit my error in not accepting your beliefs long ago.
01:52:52.375,01:52:53.541,Oh...
01:52:54.458,01:52:56.333,All that matters now is the future.
01:52:56.541,01:52:57.458,Yes.
01:53:00.125,01:53:01.958,I have carried this...
01:53:03.000,01:53:04.875,for the last twenty years.
01:53:06.500,01:53:07.916,When we reach Z...
01:53:08.500,01:53:10.458,I shall send it to you as a sign.
01:53:12.333,01:53:14.666,Just in case I decide not to come back.
01:53:14.791,01:53:16.250,"Oh, nonsense, nonsense."
01:53:17.416,01:53:20.791,"Oh, um, now we have something for you."
01:53:24.666,01:53:27.333,The Society's highest honor...
01:53:28.333,01:53:30.041,the Founder's Gold Medal.
01:53:49.625,01:53:51.083,and then we meet again in Brazil.
01:54:00.375,01:54:03.666,"-and Mr. Costin has a copy in safekeeping. -Yes, you've told me a thousand times."
01:54:03.791,01:54:05.416,Now run along or you'll miss your boat.
01:54:13.083,01:54:17.375,You're a man now... responsible for you mother and sister's care.
01:54:18.291,01:54:19.708,It's a fine calling.
01:54:20.500,01:54:23.500,"No less, perhaps even more virtuous than ours."
01:54:24.916,01:54:26.041,All right?
01:54:28.125,01:54:29.291,"Goodbye, father."
01:54:29.625,01:54:32.666,I shall indeed miss you... as I always have.
01:54:34.125,01:54:36.750,"-Look after your father for me. -Of course, I will, of course."
01:54:36.875,01:54:38.333,-And have fun. -Yes.
01:54:38.458,01:54:39.291,And be bold.
01:54:40.750,01:54:41.916,"Goodbye, Joan."
01:54:43.666,01:54:44.750,"Goodbye, father."
01:54:45.500,01:54:46.500,I love you.
01:54:49.083,01:54:50.250,On to Z then...
01:54:51.041,01:54:52.333,and a new history!
01:55:00.291,01:55:01.750,"Goodbye, the boys!"
01:55:27.083,01:55:29.666,Paper says 40 million people are following our journey!
01:55:30.500,01:55:31.666,It's incredible!
01:55:35.958,01:55:37.250,It's wonderful.
01:56:29.333,01:56:31.125,and if we're lucky to see an opera.
01:57:09.625,01:57:12.041,It's just a pity you couldn't see it intact.
01:57:13.583,01:57:14.583,Yes.
01:57:26.791,01:57:30.458,This is the last letter you shall receive until we reach Z.
01:57:31.375,01:57:33.750,The rest of our party is returning home.
01:57:36.250,01:57:38.958,Jack is acquitting himself marvelously.
01:57:40.041,01:57:42.666,Today we reached a tribe of Indians...
01:57:43.708,01:57:48.791,who told us of a cave entirely unknown to anyone outside of their clan...
01:57:57.666,01:58:00.916,covered with painted pictures of men and horses.
01:58:02.083,01:58:05.916,"It's location is, perhaps, the gateway to Z..."
01:58:11.041,01:58:16.000,"and he reminds me, yet again, that we are all made of the same clay..."
01:58:43.625,01:58:46.875,"Thereafter, our fate is in the lap of the gods."
01:58:47.458,01:58:50.166,You need have no fear of any failure.
01:59:09.333,01:59:11.041,Stop it! Stop it! Stop!
01:59:18.166,01:59:19.333,Stay calm.
01:59:20.625,01:59:23.291,I know the approach just... keep going.
01:59:53.125,01:59:54.916,"All right, come on back the way we came."
01:59:57.833,02:00:00.250,"Slowly, slowly, don't rush."
02:00:24.291,02:00:25.208,I'm all right. I'm all right.
02:00:46.416,02:00:49.666,"No, Jack! Keep going! Keep going!"
02:01:51.958,02:01:52.958,Be brave.
02:01:56.791,02:02:00.291,Nothing will happen to us that is not our destiny.
02:03:53.541,02:03:56.666,"So much of life is a mystery, my boy."
02:04:01.625,02:04:04.458,We know so little of this world.
02:04:10.625,02:04:15.375,But you and I have made a journey that other men cannot even imagine.
02:04:19.833,02:04:23.500,And this has given understanding to our hearts.
02:04:28.541,02:04:30.250,"I love you, father."
02:04:34.541,02:04:35.833,"I love you, son."
02:06:26.583,02:06:28.375,"Actually, Lord Bernard, I wanted..."
02:06:28.666,02:06:30.625,I wanted to read something if I could.
02:06:32.333,02:06:33.583,Now I'm in for it.
02:06:35.666,02:06:38.625,It's something I wrote in the event that I did not survive the birth.
02:06:44.791,02:06:53.500,"My Percy, I know your first instinct will be to grieve, but I adjure you rather to consider... our son..."
02:06:54.458,02:06:56.458,and the love you must show him.
02:06:59.083,02:07:00.708,I knew it would be a boy.
02:07:02.625,02:07:06.833,"Always teach him to dream, to seek the unknown."
02:07:08.791,02:07:12.416,To look for what is beautiful is its own reward.
02:07:14.708,02:07:18.541,And I beg you to remember those words so easy to forget...
02:07:19.583,02:07:20.791,A man's reach...
02:07:22.250,02:07:24.125,should exceed his grasp...
02:07:26.333,02:07:28.166,or what's a Heaven for?
02:07:29.666,02:07:31.791,"My dearest love, forever."
02:08:29.250,02:08:30.666,He was from Brazil.
02:08:33.083,02:08:34.333,He has seen...
02:08:35.833,02:08:37.250,Jack and Percy...
02:08:38.916,02:08:40.625,living with the Indians.
02:08:43.250,02:08:44.791,He says they claim...
02:08:45.625,02:08:47.583,to have reached Z.
02:08:53.041,02:08:54.833,"My dear, it's... it's..."
02:08:55.916,02:08:57.375,It's been years.
02:08:59.875,02:09:04.083,"We've sent almost 100 men to look for your husband and your son, and..."
02:09:05.791,02:09:08.875,I fear we have to accept the... inevitable.
02:09:15.583,02:09:19.708,"Sir John, I confess that the brutal wear and tear is great..."
02:09:22.833,02:09:25.375,and I suffer with heart and soul.
02:09:29.166,02:09:30.666,It has taken...
02:09:32.083,02:09:38.541,"all my strength of will to push horrors from my mind, but I beg you..."
02:09:41.291,02:09:43.375,not to lose confidence.
02:09:47.916,02:09:50.875,I cannot... doubt...
02:09:53.083,02:09:55.875,after so many years of sacrifice.
02:09:58.250,02:10:02.875,It has become... my own life's work.
02:10:15.041,02:10:17.708,The Brazilian gave me this to give to you.
02:10:18.666,02:10:21.375,He said Percy told him you would understand.
02:10:30.416,02:10:32.333,"Surely, this is a sign."
02:10:36.166,02:10:37.333,Yes...
02:10:38.125,02:10:39.750,I will have it examined.
02:10:42.625,02:10:43.625,Thank you.
