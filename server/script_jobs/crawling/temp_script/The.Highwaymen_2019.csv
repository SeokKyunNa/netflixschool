00:02:28.041,00:02:29.500,"How my Reds lookin' this year, Joe?"
00:02:29.583,00:02:30.750,Suckin' hind teat.
00:02:33.541,00:02:35.333,"Thirty-five thousand dollars, you believe that?"
00:02:35.416,00:02:38.125,A man can work ten lifetimes and not earn that kind of dough.
00:03:17.958,00:03:19.958,Where you been? Get your ass over here!
00:03:22.041,00:03:23.625,"Crowson, Hamilton's out of group again."
00:03:23.708,00:03:25.541,"I'll take him back. Ray, come on!"
00:03:28.375,00:03:29.375,Drop your rifle.
00:03:30.958,00:03:31.958,Drop it.
00:03:36.750,00:03:37.666,Joe...
00:04:18.208,00:04:19.083,Wait!
00:04:32.041,00:04:33.083,Wait!
00:04:47.750,00:04:48.875,"Mornin', boys."
00:04:48.958,00:04:51.041,"Ma, no one's ever broken out of your prison."
00:04:51.125,00:04:52.583,Bonnie and Clyde break in?
00:04:54.666,00:04:57.625,"Never say die, boys. Say damned, never say die."
00:05:00.416,00:05:01.666,callin' 'em Robin Hoods.
00:05:01.750,00:05:03.166,"Are they Robin Hoods, Ma?"
00:05:05.375,00:05:11.333,Did Robin Hood ever shoot a gas station attendant point-blank in the head for four dollars and a tank of gas?
00:05:12.833,00:05:15.166,We will capture Clyde Barrow and his paramour.
00:05:15.791,00:05:17.750,Write that down and underline it twice.
00:05:40.041,00:05:43.041,"If today was a fish, I'd throw the son of a bitch back."
00:05:45.625,00:05:48.416,-How did it happen? -Clyde did a nickel at Eastham.
00:05:48.708,00:05:52.291,"He knew the system. Planted guns, ran it like a military operation."
00:05:52.375,00:05:53.375,Where are we on this?
00:05:53.458,00:05:56.875,Hoover and the Feds are proceeding-- Where are we on this?
00:05:56.958,00:05:59.458,"-Dallas detectives, highway patrol-- -Ma Ferguson agents."
00:05:59.541,00:06:02.458,"Same as we've had for the past six months, with no end in sight."
00:06:02.541,00:06:04.375,"Busted into your damn facility, Lee."
00:06:05.333,00:06:09.208,"You're right, they did. Wounded one of my guards, killed another."
00:06:09.291,00:06:12.041,"Died in my arms, apologizin' for letting me down."
00:06:15.250,00:06:17.166,I'd like a say and how we handle this.
00:06:17.958,00:06:20.333,Fine. Let's hear it.
00:06:21.375,00:06:25.750,Was a time we'd put a pair of man-killers on the trail and let them do their job.
00:06:26.500,00:06:27.583,Texas Rangers.
00:06:27.791,00:06:30.791,"Was a time, and that time's passed."
00:06:33.125,00:06:35.541,and you wanna put cowboys on Bonnie and Clyde?
00:06:35.833,00:06:38.000,-Is that what you're selling? -Frank Hamer.
00:06:39.125,00:06:40.500,That's what I'm sellin'.
00:06:43.041,00:06:44.875,Why don't we just go dig up Wyatt Earp.
00:06:44.958,00:06:46.041,Wild Bill Hickok.
00:06:48.750,00:06:50.875,"And you're right proud of it, aren't ya, Mrs. Governor?"
00:06:50.958,00:06:55.250,"Damn right I am! They took orders from no one, and they left me to answer for the blood."
00:06:55.333,00:06:57.583,Seems like you're answerin' for it again.
00:07:01.750,00:07:04.375,Bonnie and Clyde have been on the road for two years.
00:07:04.958,00:07:07.916,Cold-blooded killers who are more adored than movie stars.
00:07:09.166,00:07:10.208,This has to stop.
00:07:25.625,00:07:26.500,Where is he?
00:08:19.583,00:08:25.000,but Hamer married well and did just fine in private security with the oil companies.
00:08:29.500,00:08:31.500,"Doesn't sound like he needs a job, sir."
00:08:33.166,00:08:34.833,"No, Luther, I suppose it doesn't."
00:08:47.541,00:08:48.666,He ain't gonna bite.
00:08:48.875,00:08:49.791,Frank.
00:08:50.833,00:08:51.666,Lee.
00:08:51.875,00:08:54.000,"That's, uh, quite the watchdog you got there."
00:08:55.000,00:09:01.166,"Widow in Alpine, too tough to eat, wouldn't run off, Gladdie hates him, but... he's my friend not hers."
00:09:09.208,00:09:10.208,Speakin' of what?
00:09:11.250,00:09:12.083,Friends.
00:09:14.666,00:09:16.875,Lubbock. Maney’s in Lubbock.
00:09:18.250,00:09:19.208,What brings ya?
00:09:20.125,00:09:22.833,You may have heard there was a prison break. Huntsville?
00:09:22.916,00:09:25.541,"Well, Ma Ferguson pardons a hundred convicts a month."
00:09:26.500,00:09:30.250,"They could've just signed her a check, saved themselves a lot of trouble."
00:09:30.916,00:09:32.500,It was the Barrow Gang done it.
00:09:33.541,00:09:34.750,Bonnie and Clyde.
00:09:34.833,00:09:38.583,Nobody can put a net over them. A thousand men in the field right now.
00:09:38.666,00:09:40.000,He must be good.
00:09:40.916,00:09:44.000,Got the drop on six peace officers so far-- What can I do for you?
00:09:46.250,00:09:47.500,Put 'em on the spot.
00:09:51.208,00:09:55.875,"Don't mention that idea inside the governor's mansion, not unless you wanna be laughed at."
00:09:55.958,00:09:58.458,"I did, and they did, but she'll back me up on this."
00:09:59.750,00:10:01.541,She gonna bring back the Rangers?
00:10:01.625,00:10:02.583,"No, never."
00:10:03.625,00:10:04.958,"In what capacity, then?"
00:10:05.500,00:10:06.916,Special highway assignment.
00:10:16.708,00:10:19.666,"A hundred and thirty. It don't matter what badge you got, Frank."
00:10:19.750,00:10:21.666,We just need you to put 'em out of business.
00:10:22.250,00:10:23.458,I thought you and Maney.
00:10:29.833,00:10:31.791,You know you're gonna have to put this man down.
00:10:31.875,00:10:34.750,The governor says you'll have full authority to do whatever's necessary.
00:10:34.833,00:10:35.791,Those are her words.
00:10:43.375,00:10:45.291,"Well, Lee Simmons, as I live and breathe."
00:10:45.375,00:10:47.375,"Live in the same town, never see you."
00:10:47.958,00:10:51.250,"Hello, Gladys. You look lovely as always."
00:10:59.750,00:11:01.791,"Look at my new Henry Ford, Lee."
00:11:02.333,00:11:04.041,"Eighty-five horses, ain't she fun?"
00:11:04.125,00:11:05.916,"Yes, ma'am, she certainly is."
00:11:06.000,00:11:07.000,What brings you out?
00:11:07.083,00:11:08.666,"Oh, come by, say hello."
00:11:10.208,00:11:13.291,"Lady Governor's offering me 130 dollars a month, Gladdie."
00:11:13.625,00:11:14.458,To do what?
00:11:16.166,00:11:17.583,Hunt down Bonnie and Clyde.
00:11:23.750,00:11:26.041,"-I'd best get back to my office. -I think you'd best, Lee."
00:11:45.291,00:11:46.625,Something you wanna say?
00:11:47.583,00:11:48.916,I'm gonna repaint the kitchen.
00:11:55.166,00:11:57.458,"Mm-hmm. Yellow, I think."
00:13:01.833,00:13:03.291,Dear Lord.
00:13:13.750,00:13:16.166,I'll get the rooster over here and squeeze one out of him.
00:13:20.625,00:13:22.291,Told you it looked like tornado weather.
00:13:24.041,00:13:28.375,report a harrowing shoot-out between gangsters Bonnie and Clyde and officers of the law.
00:13:28.875,00:13:32.666,The lawless lovers fired hundreds of machine-gun rounds at the outnumbered officers.
00:13:32.750,00:13:34.875,No report yet on the number of fatalities.
00:13:35.333,00:13:37.791,We now return to your regular scheduled program.
00:14:16.333,00:14:17.875,You boys work for Ol' Salazar?
00:14:17.958,00:14:24.541,"Yes, sir. Mend the fence, cut Johnson grass, I think I've seen you before."
00:14:25.041,00:14:28.250,Yeah. He sent me out here to give you boys a break.
00:14:31.875,00:14:32.708,"Come on, fellas."
00:14:47.541,00:14:49.625,and see if you can't get a couple up here high for me.
00:14:49.708,00:14:54.791,"All right, and just... How about every one I hit, you get a nickel?"
00:14:58.000,00:14:59.000,Let her rip.
00:15:06.750,00:15:07.833,"Yeah, let's do another one."
00:15:25.583,00:15:26.583,"Well, for pity's sake."
00:15:44.125,00:15:45.041,All right.
00:15:55.541,00:15:56.708,You got a piece of that.
00:16:01.250,00:16:02.416,Just a piece.
00:16:06.458,00:16:08.750,"Go ahead. Take it, boys."
00:16:12.541,00:16:14.208,It's for keeping your mouth shut.
00:16:15.500,00:16:16.333,"Yes, sir."
00:16:17.500,00:16:19.000,You bring me that bag there?
00:16:22.958,00:16:24.791,Was you really Frank Hamer?
00:16:28.916,00:16:31.916,"Yep. You boys best get back to work, okay?"
00:16:32.208,00:16:33.041,Go on.
00:16:45.375,00:16:49.125,"-Mrs. Hamer, may I help you with anything? -Keep Leanne from spikin' that punch."
00:16:56.125,00:16:57.000,Nice turnout.
00:16:59.750,00:17:00.666,Where's Porky?
00:17:05.416,00:17:08.083,I don't suppose there's any chance you wanna take him with you?
00:17:13.125,00:17:15.708,Don't pretend you didn't just hide this from me.
00:17:22.250,00:17:24.375,I suppose you're gonna want to take my new Ford.
00:17:26.791,00:17:36.083,"I... I could tell you you're too old for this, or that it's not your affair, or that you hadn't held a gun in quite a while."
00:17:38.041,00:17:40.375,"I know that's all a waste of time, so I won't."
00:17:40.708,00:17:44.000,And I appreciate you not telling me any of that.
00:17:47.541,00:17:48.791,"I'm sorry, Gladdie."
00:17:53.833,00:17:55.916,I knew what you were when I married you.
00:18:01.041,00:18:03.916,"Oh, I packed sandwiches. They're in the icebox."
00:18:09.041,00:18:09.916,Thank you.
00:18:38.291,00:18:39.291,Something else.
00:18:41.083,00:18:42.916,"If you're covering miles, keep oil in her."
00:18:43.833,00:18:44.708,"Yes, ma'am."
00:18:51.583,00:18:53.083,"Those two scare me, Frank."
00:18:59.791,00:19:00.666,You tell me.
00:19:05.916,00:19:07.041,I'll come back.
00:19:40.250,00:19:41.500,Too good to come to my office?
00:19:44.125,00:19:46.166,"All the same, I'd rather keep this low-key."
00:19:47.583,00:19:48.416,Files.
00:19:49.458,00:19:51.583,"Here's your authorization, right there."
00:19:51.875,00:19:55.208,Your jurisdiction technically ends at the state line and the border.
00:19:55.833,00:19:56.791,Technically.
00:20:02.333,00:20:05.833,You will keep me posted. Call me from the road?
00:20:06.500,00:20:07.500,I'll call you when.
00:20:14.541,00:20:16.916,Texarkana? El Paso? Dallas?
00:20:17.708,00:20:18.541,Lubbock?
00:22:28.791,00:22:29.750,Yeah.
00:22:30.291,00:22:34.208,"Momma says you should get up for breakfast, even if you don't have a job."
00:22:37.000,00:22:38.208,"Yeah, you're right."
00:22:45.791,00:22:48.541,I've gotta take Dan over to see a man about some work.
00:22:48.625,00:22:51.333,Can you make sure Nate gets off to school on time?
00:22:53.708,00:22:56.375,Thinkin' about adding another bay down at the garage.
00:22:57.875,00:22:59.916,Pete said to call him in a few weeks.
00:23:00.375,00:23:01.625,"We're okay, Daddy."
00:23:02.250,00:23:03.083,Really.
00:23:07.625,00:23:08.666,Comin'!
00:23:32.791,00:23:34.125,"Thanks, Pop-Pop."
00:23:35.625,00:23:37.666,"That's a dang good biscuit, right there."
00:24:08.208,00:24:10.875,"You fix cars, so you could fix Daddy's?"
00:24:12.416,00:24:14.458,I could if he'd ever let me near it.
00:24:15.416,00:24:17.541,"But you used to be famous, right?"
00:24:21.041,00:24:23.458,-Who told you that? -Timmy Hess.
00:24:23.625,00:24:25.625,He said you shot lots of crooks.
00:24:26.583,00:24:29.041,"Oh, yeah? What else did Timmy have to say?"
00:24:29.125,00:24:37.791,"Nothin', just that you might go to hell for it Go on."
00:25:31.916,00:25:32.750,Can I help you?
00:25:36.166,00:25:39.208,"Yeah, I'd like to have a look at that Thompson submachine gun."
00:25:45.625,00:25:49.875,"And the Colt Monitor machine rifle, one up top there with the custom pistol grip."
00:25:49.958,00:25:50.791,Carter.
00:25:56.541,00:25:58.000,The Colt automatic pistol...
00:25:59.125,00:26:01.250,and the 1917 Smith right behind it.
00:26:03.875,00:26:06.416,I'm gonna wanna see that BAR .30-06.
00:26:08.625,00:26:11.583,"And the '03 Springfield with the glass, up top there."
00:26:12.916,00:26:15.458,"That Remington Model 11, right gun over there."
00:26:17.625,00:26:19.041,"No, sir. I want the short barrel."
00:26:20.708,00:26:22.333,"-Is that the 12? -Yes, sir."
00:26:22.750,00:26:25.666,"Let me see that older Winchester you got there, that .30-30."
00:26:29.416,00:26:30.291,"No, I'll take it."
00:26:40.750,00:26:42.875,I'll need one gun that won't jam.
00:26:42.958,00:26:45.375,Would you be wanting the stick or the drum for the Tommy?
00:26:45.458,00:26:47.291,-How many in the stick? -Twenty rounds.
00:26:47.375,00:26:50.041,I'll take a dozen... and two of them drums.
00:26:51.875,00:26:54.875,And a handful of them half-moon clips for this Smith if you've got them.
00:26:54.958,00:26:56.958,Do you have this in black instead of nickel?
00:26:57.041,00:26:58.083,Too damn shiny.
00:26:58.166,00:26:59.583,"I believe I do, sir."
00:27:00.333,00:27:03.250,"All right, then. That'll... that'll do it."
00:27:05.333,00:27:06.958,-Which will do it? -All of 'em.
00:27:08.416,00:27:09.791,"-All of 'em? -Yes, sir."
00:27:10.916,00:27:16.750,"Along with four cases of 45 lead, same for the .30-06, and say..."
00:27:18.333,00:27:20.125,an even 100 each of the others.
00:27:20.208,00:27:23.416,What are you going after that you need all this firepower?
00:27:23.833,00:27:25.166,If you don't mind me askin'.
00:27:25.583,00:27:27.500,"No, sir. I don't mind at all."
00:28:07.333,00:28:08.375,How'd you know it was me?
00:28:11.083,00:28:14.458,I thought you was the bank till I saw how poorly you drove.
00:28:18.833,00:28:21.333,All them guns have anything to do with that...
00:28:22.250,00:28:23.916,jackass and his girlfriend?
00:28:25.250,00:28:26.916,Is it as bad as the headlines?
00:28:29.291,00:28:31.750,-Yeah. -You came all the way up to the house.
00:28:32.625,00:28:33.916,What changed your mind?
00:28:35.583,00:28:38.208,"I don't know, maybe seeing you move like you're 85."
00:28:42.500,00:28:44.333,Maybe a little... too honest.
00:28:45.333,00:28:47.666,"You coulda asked me, let me decide."
00:28:47.750,00:28:50.000,That would've been the polite thing to do.
00:28:50.083,00:28:53.166,"Well, like you said, I changed my mind. Besides, what would your..."
00:28:57.541,00:28:59.000,That a weight's been lifted.
00:29:00.083,00:29:02.583,"Well, you know how it goes, I gotta live the way they do, Gault."
00:29:02.666,00:29:05.750,"This case, that means sleepin' in the car, drivin' thousands of miles a week."
00:29:09.750,00:29:12.791,"When I do, I most always dream about dead Mexicans."
00:29:14.666,00:29:17.000,-I think I'll look up Ledbetter. -He's dead.
00:29:21.041,00:29:22.750,-Or Cuthbert. -Dead too.
00:29:22.833,00:29:28.250,"So's Alvarez, and if you go any further down the roster, I'm gonna be gravely offended."
00:29:28.333,00:29:30.666,"Dammit, Pancho, I'm above ground..."
00:29:31.458,00:29:32.416,and ready to go.
00:29:34.125,00:29:34.958,Unless you...
00:29:36.250,00:29:37.625,think I'm useless.
00:29:40.125,00:29:41.166,You in good spirits?
00:29:44.125,00:29:47.000,Pretty polite way of asking if I'm drinkin'.
00:29:47.916,00:29:48.916,"Well, are you?"
00:29:54.541,00:29:55.375,holding.
00:29:57.333,00:29:58.958,I could help with the driving.
00:29:59.041,00:29:59.875,No.
00:29:59.958,00:30:00.791,Or not.
00:30:06.666,00:30:07.958,"Ah, Judas Priest. Get in."
00:30:10.000,00:30:10.916,But no singin'.
00:30:17.500,00:30:27.458,and the last thing this administration needs is for a couple of has-been vaqueros to make that program look anything less than stellar during this economic crisis.
00:30:28.666,00:30:30.166,Nod if your ears are workin'.
00:30:32.500,00:30:35.041,you're gonna be on guard duty at Eastham Prison Farm.
00:30:35.625,00:30:38.833,Get Barrow off the damn road before they do!
00:30:43.375,00:30:46.625,"Why, here you all are! I'm so glad to see you!"
00:30:46.708,00:30:48.750,Get your checkbooks out!
00:31:00.541,00:31:02.375,"Mount Ayr, Iowa."
00:31:09.041,00:31:10.875,"Hey, if you're getting tired, I could always..."
00:31:11.666,00:31:15.125,dr-- Just sayin'.
00:31:17.333,00:31:21.916,"Hey, uh, you think it was them robbed that armory up there?"
00:31:23.291,00:31:25.041,Uh-huh. It's a good chance.
00:31:25.125,00:31:28.125,Stole a car in Illinois. Shot their way out of a roadblock.
00:31:28.208,00:31:30.666,They've been followin' these same loops now for three years.
00:31:30.750,00:31:35.458,"North to Kansas or Iowa, east to Illinois or Indiana, south to Arkansas."
00:31:36.541,00:31:38.916,Then right back to Texas to start over again.
00:31:39.000,00:31:41.500,We've got no jurisdiction north of Red River.
00:31:42.083,00:31:45.500,Maybe... Hoover will take 'em up there. Carthage...
00:31:46.666,00:31:49.291,"Carthage. Carthage, Missouri."
00:31:49.375,00:31:54.666,"Hell, I don’t remember a saddle being as hard on a man’s ass as these seats."
00:32:02.541,00:32:05.416,"I never shot a girl before, Pancho."
00:32:11.833,00:32:12.708,she'll surrender.
00:32:15.458,00:32:17.666,We’re gonna shoot a man without fair warning?
00:32:17.750,00:32:19.166,"Well, Lord knows he does."
00:32:19.250,00:32:22.291,"Yeah, well, Lord knows that’s what separates us from him."
00:32:27.125,00:32:28.333,"Clarksdale, Mississippi."
00:32:30.750,00:32:32.583,-Where next? -Where they're headed.
00:32:35.083,00:32:35.958,Home.
00:33:00.625,00:33:02.083,West Dallas viaduct.
00:33:07.583,00:33:08.791,The Devil's Back Porch.
00:33:11.791,00:33:14.208,And I thought my circumstances were bad.
00:33:17.583,00:33:18.583,Let me see the file.
00:33:21.166,00:33:22.166,Bernal Street.
00:33:25.208,00:33:26.916,"That's her momma's house, right there."
00:33:29.833,00:33:31.541,They're real close to one another.
00:33:35.708,00:33:39.291,Should be the Barrows up on the corner. Eagle Ford Road.
00:33:59.291,00:34:03.333,once a day -till about a week ago. -How the hell they knew that?
00:34:05.416,00:34:06.500,Federal wiretaps.
00:34:06.750,00:34:07.625,Huh?
00:34:07.708,00:34:12.041,G-men can hook up to the party lines and record conversation.
00:34:12.125,00:34:13.000,No.
00:34:15.166,00:34:16.541,I'll be goddamned.
00:34:49.000,00:34:50.416,What's this kid up to?
00:34:55.791,00:34:57.208,"Whoa, Pancho!"
00:36:30.458,00:36:32.750,Were you... chasing someone?
00:36:33.666,00:36:35.791,"Jim Thorpe, who are you?"
00:36:35.875,00:36:38.625,"John Quinn, State Ferguson Agent."
00:36:38.958,00:36:41.375,"This is Kendale, US Bureau of Investigation."
00:36:42.041,00:36:44.250,"We heard you were on special assignment, sir."
00:36:45.916,00:36:48.666,He also sends a tip by way of his contacts down south.
00:36:53.458,00:36:54.291,Ask him.
00:36:56.208,00:36:57.041,You okay?
00:37:00.250,00:37:01.625,I woulda been dead by now.
00:37:01.708,00:37:04.625,"You ran one more block, we'd both be dead."
00:37:09.708,00:37:11.875,but this is a highly-coordinated operation.
00:37:11.958,00:37:14.791,"That said, we're happy for any help you two might give us..."
00:37:16.250,00:37:17.375,down in Brownsville.
00:37:17.875,00:37:19.333,"You ever hunt wild horses, Quinn?"
00:37:21.041,00:37:22.041,What?
00:37:24.250,00:37:25.166,Jeez!
00:37:25.625,00:37:29.416,"They hunt a big range, but they always come home."
00:37:29.500,00:37:33.583,"We've got a thousand-person dragnet in full operation here. Roadblocks, air surveillance."
00:37:33.666,00:37:36.916,Don’t think the Barrow Gang’s gonna be coming back to the neighborhood any time soon.
00:37:41.708,00:37:43.583,"Well, maybe you gentlemen should go home too."
00:37:44.500,00:37:45.583,This isn't Llano County.
00:37:45.666,00:37:48.625,It'd be a shame if either of you got hurt in retirement.
00:37:53.000,00:37:55.041,It'd be a shame... if anybody got hurt.
00:37:59.750,00:38:03.083,I think what detective Quinn means is the Barrow Gang just hit an armory.
00:38:03.166,00:38:04.291,They're armed to kill.
00:38:11.875,00:38:14.125,"Didn't have one in your saddlebags, I imagine."
00:38:14.208,00:38:16.125,It's essential in a dragnet.
00:38:16.958,00:38:19.166,"Without it, you might as well be in Timbuktu."
00:38:19.666,00:38:24.833,"Or... down in Brownsville, following your bullshit tip."
00:38:44.000,00:38:45.458,"Smoot Schmid, gentlemen."
00:38:45.541,00:38:49.916,"No need to introduce yourself, I know who you are, but I’d be honored to shake your hand anyway."
00:38:50.583,00:38:55.333,"-Hey. -Bob Alcorn there, and Deputy Ted Hinton holding up the Cola machine."
00:38:56.625,00:38:57.458,Have a seat.
00:39:03.166,00:39:06.375,You know how many times I have told my grandson the Candelaria story?
00:39:06.458,00:39:09.083,"Every night before he goes to bed, that's what he wants to hear."
00:39:09.166,00:39:10.625,"And I mean, every night."
00:39:11.041,00:39:12.041,And how's he sleep?
00:39:14.166,00:39:16.708,"Sheriff, we're involved in the Barrow manhunt..."
00:39:17.416,00:39:18.750,in a very private way.
00:39:18.833,00:39:20.791,"Well, it's not too private. Word gets around."
00:39:21.791,00:39:23.791,We heard that Clyde put a price on your head.
00:39:23.875,00:39:27.666,And I keep my front door unlocked in case that son of a bitch ever wants to stop by.
00:39:31.625,00:39:33.125,We're gonna take him down.
00:39:34.750,00:39:35.750,But we need your help.
00:39:36.333,00:39:37.666,I would be honored.
00:39:37.750,00:39:40.750,We're lookin' for a confidence in the neighborhood.
00:39:40.833,00:39:45.083,Someone who knows the families and... willing to talk.
00:39:46.041,00:39:48.750,"Well, how about a boy that grew up with 'em?"
00:39:48.833,00:39:52.208,"That worked with Clyde, known Bonnie ever since she was a girl."
00:39:53.875,00:40:02.541,"a positive identification on 'em from first sighting Now, he's got the mental range of a windshield wiper, but he's reliable."
00:40:05.916,00:40:07.125,Holding up the Cola machine.
00:40:10.541,00:40:13.250,Tough place to grow up. Clyde was always mischief.
00:40:13.916,00:40:16.125,"You know, me and him used to play cops and robbers."
00:40:19.125,00:40:20.416,All I ever wanted to be.
00:40:20.666,00:40:22.833,That or shortstop for the Cleveland Indians.
00:40:23.791,00:40:27.375,"And Bonnie? You, uh... you know Miss Parker?"
00:40:27.458,00:40:30.875,She grew up on the backside of the Porch. Near Cement City.
00:40:31.291,00:40:33.333,-No daddy. -Must be one hard lady.
00:40:35.583,00:40:38.583,can't weigh but 90 pounds. The smartest girl in school.
00:40:38.666,00:40:41.416,"She was in all the plays, -won the spelling bees, -Yeah."
00:40:41.500,00:40:42.875,-Yeah. -wrote poetry...
00:40:42.958,00:40:43.958,Yeah.
00:40:44.041,00:40:46.500,"I mean, attractive girl. Taffy-colored hair."
00:40:46.583,00:40:49.291,Sounds like the shortstop was maybe a little sweet on her?
00:40:49.375,00:40:52.333,Any boy she ever waited on at the Courthouse Café was sweet on her.
00:40:52.416,00:40:54.625,How'd she fall in with an outlaw like Barrow?
00:40:55.666,00:40:59.000,Bored to tears. Along come Clyde in a fine car.
00:40:59.083,00:41:01.666,"By the time she found out the car was stolen, she was already in love."
00:41:01.750,00:41:03.000,Ain't that romantic.
00:41:03.083,00:41:07.458,"When I met my wife, she was milkin' a prize Devon at the Oklahoma State Fair."
00:41:08.250,00:41:18.166,"I can't imagine anybody writing a ballad You know, the files say they ran two of your roadblocks."
00:41:19.791,00:41:22.125,"Well, they ran roadblocks in Oklahoma, too."
00:41:22.541,00:41:24.250,"Kansas, New Mexico."
00:41:25.541,00:41:27.458,Also said you had a clear shot at 'em.
00:41:30.416,00:41:33.208,They say Clyde is some sort of Fu Manchu.
00:41:33.708,00:41:35.000,"You know, can't be touched."
00:41:35.791,00:41:38.583,Time Magazine called him superhuman. Y'all see that?
00:41:38.916,00:41:41.000,"Maybe you weren't able to pull on her, Ted."
00:41:41.750,00:41:49.750,-Sir? -Couldn't pull the trigger on a nice girl who used to serve you pecan pie at the Courthouse Café.
00:41:50.541,00:41:52.125,You're not able to do it.
00:41:52.958,00:41:56.458,"Well, I won't have to. I'm stationed right here in West Dallas."
00:41:56.541,00:42:01.250,"Be a cold day in hell before they show their faces -on the Back Porch. -Well, they're on their way, Ted."
00:42:01.500,00:42:05.916,"According to the wiretaps, Mrs. Parker is cooking red beans and cabbage Easter Sunday."
00:42:06.000,00:42:07.541,"Sir, I don't understand what you mean."
00:42:08.666,00:42:11.208,"Ted, you don't know what wiretaps are?"
00:42:11.625,00:42:16.041,Of course I know what wiretaps are! I just don’t understand what red beans and cabbage have to do with it.
00:42:17.583,00:42:23.875,"that she has red beans and cabbage on the stove, those dates, they match up to sightings or shoot-outs in the general Dallas area."
00:42:23.958,00:42:27.291,"Red beans and cabbage, that's code. Means the kids are comin' home."
00:42:30.416,00:42:31.708,"So, do I just ride with you boys?"
00:42:31.791,00:42:34.708,"No, sir. We'll meet you in two days, Easter Sunday."
00:42:34.791,00:42:37.541,"You meet us first thing in the morning, a block from Eagle Ford Road."
00:42:37.625,00:42:39.916,I'll need you to make the ID on Barrow and Parker.
00:42:40.000,00:42:40.833,I'm your man.
00:42:44.041,00:42:45.333,They're afraid to shoot the girl.
00:42:46.625,00:42:49.333,"Gives Clyde the one second he needs to get the drop, and..."
00:42:50.416,00:42:51.666,toothpick there knows it.
00:42:58.583,00:43:00.458,and how he lived and died.
00:43:00.541,00:43:04.583,Still in the need of somethin' to read? Here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.
00:43:06.250,00:43:09.375,Used to be... you had to have talent to get published.
00:43:09.458,00:43:11.958,Now you just have to shoot people.
00:43:21.041,00:43:22.250,What is this place?
00:43:27.250,00:43:29.500,They were sighted a month or two ago camping...
00:43:30.541,00:43:31.958,camping somewhere out here.
00:43:36.958,00:43:38.375,Somebody's a damn good eye.
00:43:39.916,00:43:42.166,"Well, that or they just walked right up to it."
00:43:53.625,00:43:54.458,Look at it.
00:43:55.750,00:43:57.500,Every shot right through the same hole.
00:43:57.583,00:43:59.333,When's the last time you fired that thing?
00:43:59.875,00:44:02.750,You know what we're up against? Hmm? Any idea?
00:44:03.250,00:44:05.458,"Ain't nothin' we ain't seen before, Pancho."
00:44:05.541,00:44:09.666,There was a shoot-out in Joplin. Over a thousand rounds were fired.
00:44:20.416,00:44:23.083,"Fires a 20-round volley at 3,000 feet per second."
00:44:23.625,00:44:26.916,"Our boy Clyde, he prefers a Browning Automatic .30 cal."
00:44:27.000,00:44:30.125,"Pretty much the same gun, except now the little shit uses a..."
00:44:31.291,00:44:35.041,welded over-and-under clip that can fire 40.
00:44:36.833,00:44:38.083,"Well, he ain't met ol' Lucky."
00:44:38.166,00:44:39.500,Shit. I ain’t that lucky.
00:44:55.125,00:44:56.791,"Hey, got one of them for me?"
00:46:15.166,00:46:16.041,Gotta pee.
00:46:18.000,00:46:21.541,"Yeah, might be something left after the 40 times you were up all night."
00:46:21.625,00:46:25.250,"Yeah, well, there's a place in heaven for Gladys, the way you saw wood."
00:46:25.333,00:46:26.458,When did you start that?
00:47:09.375,00:47:12.666,"Barrows and Parkers stayed put, and no one's really seen Clyde around."
00:47:14.291,00:47:19.708,You wouldn’t think Clyde would’ve noticed a little metal man leading a circus through his old neighborhood?
00:47:21.916,00:47:27.041,"I hear there's red beans and cabbage over at the Parker house if you’re hungry, Captain Hamer."
00:47:27.125,00:47:30.666,Maybe they rode in on their mustangs and then rode back out again.
00:47:31.083,00:47:32.500,Shots fired over near Grapevine.
00:47:32.708,00:47:34.000,Officers down.
00:47:41.125,00:47:42.416,I didn't say anything.
00:47:47.458,00:47:48.458,"Get in the car, Ted."
00:47:54.833,00:47:57.250,"How's the view from up there, Mr. Hoover?"
00:47:57.833,00:47:59.416,You high-flying sissy.
00:48:05.833,00:48:08.166,The two officers pulled up...
00:48:52.500,00:48:55.041,"Get that to the field office, too, for fingerprint analysis."
00:48:55.125,00:48:57.916,"Careful where you step, cowboy. It's an active crime scene."
00:48:58.000,00:48:59.083,Kiss my ass.
00:49:02.000,00:49:05.750,"You were right, came back. Came right back to Dallas."
00:49:43.666,00:49:44.583,You still got two.
00:49:54.875,00:49:57.666,"Third gun who fired, we think it's either Joe Palmer or Raymond Hamilton."
00:49:58.166,00:50:00.416,"We'll run ballistics, and then maybe we'll know something."
00:50:01.208,00:50:03.583,"No, tracks are too big and deep for Palmer."
00:50:03.666,00:50:04.958,These are driver's side.
00:50:12.875,00:50:15.041,"It may have to be Raymond who shot that BAR, then."
00:50:15.541,00:50:16.791,"Yeah, heavy."
00:50:16.875,00:50:19.291,I reckon' Clyde used a ten-gauge scattergun.
00:50:19.583,00:50:21.208,Little girl used a sawed-off 20.
00:50:31.958,00:50:33.333,She drags her left leg.
00:50:34.416,00:50:35.500,She gimped?
00:50:36.500,00:50:38.916,"Well, Clyde missed a detour a month or so back."
00:50:39.000,00:50:40.750,Got her leg burned up in the wreck.
00:50:44.125,00:50:46.416,Why does Bonnie have a pet rabbit?
00:50:47.166,00:50:49.583,Maybe a present. For Bonnie's momma.
00:50:50.250,00:50:52.458,"Or Billie Mace. You know, she's generous like that."
00:50:52.541,00:50:54.875,"Yeah, she can light up a rainy day, can’t she, Ted?"
00:50:54.958,00:51:00.125,"Little bitty of a thing, ain’t but 90 pounds, but she could shoot a patrolman in the face, point-blank, while he's down."
00:51:04.708,00:51:05.666,He was on his side.
00:51:05.750,00:51:08.708,She used her foot to push him over so he could see what was about to happen.
00:51:08.791,00:51:11.250,Those kids you grew up with aren’t human anymore. Look at me!
00:51:15.166,00:51:16.750,You remember that at the next roadblock.
00:51:21.041,00:51:22.916,"-You okay, son? -Yeah."
00:51:23.916,00:51:25.416,Hm. We'll be in touch.
00:52:03.250,00:52:04.291,Red River.
00:52:08.791,00:52:09.625,State line.
00:52:21.375,00:52:23.583,-Just thought I’d point that out. -Thank you.
00:52:25.000,00:52:26.583,It's open range now.
00:52:32.041,00:52:33.250,I'm not sure.
00:52:33.333,00:52:36.208,Why not? They work for you.
00:52:36.291,00:52:39.208,They were in Dallas three days ago. That's as much as I know.
00:52:39.500,00:52:43.250,"You promised to keep Hamer on a short leash, didn't you?"
00:52:45.208,00:52:48.250,"If they make a fool of me, there's gonna be hell to pay."
00:52:49.041,00:52:51.666,"Do we understand each other, Marshall Lee Simmons?"
00:52:51.750,00:52:52.583,"Yes, ma'am."
00:52:53.458,00:52:54.375,Good.
00:53:02.791,00:53:03.625,Never seen 'em?
00:53:13.500,00:53:19.791,"Well, there hasn't been another filling station for... 160 miles, you know."
00:53:23.125,00:53:25.833,You never saw blue sedan with black tires?
00:53:26.375,00:53:29.500,"-Nope. -Two men and a woman, headed northbound?"
00:53:30.583,00:53:34.041,"If it's Bonnie and Clyde you looking for, I didn't see 'em."
00:53:34.833,00:53:37.916,"And if I did, all the luck to 'em."
00:53:39.208,00:53:43.458,"They only taking from the banks that are taking from the poor folk, like me."
00:53:58.708,00:53:59.583,Well?
00:54:11.416,00:54:12.541,"Oh, Lord."
00:54:13.916,00:54:16.833,Now what? I done told you all I'm gonna tell you about Bonnie and Clyde.
00:54:21.041,00:54:24.875,"There's a peace officer, died in the puddle of himself back in Dallas."
00:54:38.000,00:54:39.333,Easter Sunday morning.
00:54:41.625,00:54:44.125,His family will be on the breadline next week.
00:54:44.541,00:54:45.375,All luck to ‘em?
00:54:46.291,00:54:47.125,Huh?
00:54:47.625,00:54:48.583,All luck to ‘em?
00:55:06.166,00:55:07.458,They come through here yesterday.
00:55:08.833,00:55:10.750,Asked me where the nearest migrant camp was.
00:55:12.041,00:55:13.541,Showed 'em on state map.
00:55:16.916,00:55:22.875,"Black tires, blue sedan, the woman was carrying a white bunny rabbit."
00:55:30.041,00:55:33.041,Gas prices these days got everybody a little riled.
00:56:11.625,00:56:14.416,"-What? -Well, you’re the more sociable type."
00:56:14.500,00:56:16.250,"Meaning, I’m the more full of shit."
00:56:21.416,00:56:22.458,You boys hiring?
00:56:24.958,00:56:28.208,My partner and I been on the road a long while.
00:56:28.291,00:56:29.750,Business went under in Fort Worth.
00:56:33.166,00:56:34.291,The banks is the Devil.
00:56:34.375,00:56:40.291,"Oh. Say, my daughter and her boyfriend been moving camp to camp, looking for work."
00:56:40.375,00:56:43.375,Would've come through in a new Ford sedan.
00:56:43.458,00:56:45.416,"Wouldn’t have happened to see them, would ya?"
00:56:45.500,00:56:47.916,"Uh, two boys and a red-haired girl."
00:56:48.000,00:56:52.000,-Tiny... thing. -They didn't come through here.
00:56:56.375,00:56:57.750,Trade for some pump water?
00:56:58.708,00:57:00.625,"Much obliged, mister. Good luck to you."
00:57:00.958,00:57:02.041,Mm-hmm.
00:57:05.166,00:57:07.166,"-Ah, they like me. -Yeah."
00:57:15.875,00:57:18.875,"Well, those are some first-rate mud pies right there."
00:57:32.750,00:57:34.416,She's all growed-up now.
00:57:35.041,00:57:37.250,Got a baby of her own. A boy.
00:57:53.291,00:57:54.500,Hey.
00:57:55.916,00:57:57.458,Can I ask you something?
00:58:00.166,00:58:02.291,Have you seen these two come around here?
00:58:02.583,00:58:04.958,Dressed up real nice. Huh?
00:58:06.708,00:58:10.083,These are bad folks. They hurt other people.
00:58:10.208,00:58:12.750,"And if we don't find them, they're gonna hurt more people."
00:58:16.791,00:58:18.208,Have you seen 'em here?
00:58:24.958,00:58:25.833,Okay.
00:58:39.708,00:58:40.583,Masterful.
00:58:41.291,00:58:43.875,"Well, why don't you just get out and beat the hell out of everybody?"
00:58:47.000,00:58:48.291,The lady gave it to me.
00:59:34.666,00:59:36.750,"Butts over here, spread out."
00:59:44.833,00:59:46.208,Hand-rolled Durham.
00:59:47.500,00:59:49.166,"She puffs Camels, right?"
00:59:50.458,00:59:51.458,Yeah.
00:59:52.250,00:59:53.541,Clyde smokes Luckies.
00:59:55.375,00:59:57.375,Always has that third man on watch.
00:59:58.875,01:00:00.708,"Usually near the car, away from ‘em."
01:00:06.000,01:00:08.458,only one still with ‘em.
01:00:09.041,01:00:12.083,"Hamilton maybe, like you said."
01:00:12.291,01:00:13.833,"Well, maybe I was wrong."
01:00:15.375,01:00:17.916,"Uh, sorry, I-- I didn’t catch that. You were what?"
01:00:18.458,01:00:25.291,"Hamilton, he’s a… he's a front-runner, a peacock. Old Durham over there, he’s a follower."
01:00:25.375,01:00:27.208,I suppose you got all that from their file?
01:00:27.291,01:00:30.458,"Well, you track a wolf, you track a dog, pretty soon you know the difference."
01:00:31.375,01:00:33.958,"Our third man over there, that’s Clyde’s watchdog."
01:00:39.291,01:00:41.500,"You know, he may not drink, but..."
01:00:42.916,01:00:43.833,she sure does.
01:00:44.166,01:00:47.958,Little girl’s in serious pain. Laudanum.
01:00:54.291,01:00:55.750,I love Clara Bow.
01:01:41.291,01:01:42.791,You folks need some help?
01:02:02.625,01:02:04.041,"Oh, Lord, help me."
01:02:05.000,01:02:06.208,"Hi, sweetie."
01:02:36.708,01:02:38.666,Kansas or Panhandle?
01:02:58.500,01:03:00.583,You know you got a radio in this thing?
01:03:00.666,01:03:01.916,That ain’t factory.
01:03:02.458,01:03:03.916,How much that set you back?
01:03:04.000,01:03:05.583,You’d have to ask Gladdie.
01:03:06.625,01:03:10.666,"It's just an intrusion on a man’s peace and quiet, not that I've had any since Lubbock."
01:03:18.166,01:03:20.083,"Oh, yeah, that's a goodun."
01:03:30.541,01:03:37.875,"Police are not yet releasing details, but it has been reported that two officers have been shot on a country road in a rural area just north of Commerce, Oklahoma."
01:03:37.958,01:03:39.083,How far is that?
01:03:39.166,01:03:40.833,No other details are known at this time.
01:04:09.166,01:04:10.166,How are we today?
01:04:10.250,01:04:13.166,"Well, it's never good when a peace officer goes down in the line."
01:04:15.500,01:04:18.458,"We, uh, need to get through, sir. Now."
01:04:18.541,01:04:20.458,Only the Bureau has multi-state jurisdiction.
01:04:22.083,01:04:28.958,"This paper is worthless up here. So, unless you’re government agents, or Oklahoma police officers, you’re not passing this roadblock."
01:04:30.125,01:04:31.666,Turn this vehicle around.
01:05:03.208,01:05:04.750,They need dope for the girl.
01:05:06.625,01:05:08.166,What’s the closest large town?
01:05:08.750,01:05:11.041,"You know what, Pancho? Maybe I should drive."
01:05:13.500,01:05:14.708,What town?
01:05:39.000,01:05:40.250,How much we cost.
01:05:44.833,01:05:46.125,"Hell, I don't know."
01:05:48.916,01:05:50.125,"Sixteen, I think."
01:05:54.916,01:05:57.791,"like he can kidney stones. You, uh..."
01:05:59.000,01:06:02.625,Might be good to have a doctor look at you sometime.
01:06:02.708,01:06:04.833,Might be good to have a doctor look at you sometime.
01:06:05.250,01:06:06.833,I ain't got no bullets in me.
01:06:07.291,01:06:09.375,Because I was covering you.
01:06:15.125,01:06:17.208,Clyde’s ahead of us on the road.
01:06:17.291,01:06:19.166,How long we gonna just sit here?
01:06:19.250,01:06:21.083,I don't know. You got a better idea?
01:06:22.291,01:06:23.708,I don’t know if it’s better.
01:06:24.666,01:06:29.500,The file said there was one convict tried to make that Eastham escape...
01:06:29.583,01:06:31.000,but missed the bus.
01:06:31.083,01:06:32.500,Wade McNabb.
01:06:34.791,01:06:37.875,"if you were a free man, wouldn't you try to meet up with your friends?"
01:06:38.458,01:06:41.125,McNabb's only in for firearms.
01:06:41.208,01:06:44.166,He's not a killer. Lee Simmons could get him furloughed.
01:06:44.250,01:06:46.291,Lady Governor would have to sign for it.
01:06:46.958,01:06:51.000,I’d wager she’s not too happy about us expanding our jurisdiction.
01:06:51.083,01:06:53.750,"-Um, just saying. -Maney."
01:07:02.375,01:07:03.916,I've seen ten of 'em today.
01:07:05.958,01:07:07.458,"Yeah, it's the..."
01:07:08.625,01:07:10.791,-It's the fashion. -All the rage.
01:07:18.125,01:07:19.083,Where you going?
01:07:19.791,01:07:21.000,Nature calls.
01:07:21.583,01:07:23.083,Jiminy Christmas. Ya just went!
01:09:21.166,01:09:22.750,"It's them, round the corner."
01:09:23.166,01:09:24.250,Grab a shotgun.
01:09:30.791,01:09:33.166,I’m gonna back us out of here. Come on.
01:09:39.708,01:09:40.583,Son of a...
01:09:43.625,01:09:45.833,They parked in the back. One of 'em went in.
01:09:46.583,01:09:49.000,Wasn’t Ray Hamilton either. It was Henry Methvin.
01:09:49.083,01:09:52.041,"-The third man in the jailbreak. -I know, I saw him. You let him go?"
01:09:53.791,01:09:55.666,"Well, I had my eye on Clyde."
01:09:55.750,01:09:58.666,Clyde? You had your... You had your eye on Clyde?
01:10:02.583,01:10:03.958,Why didn’t you take him?
01:10:04.958,01:10:06.250,Too many people.
01:10:06.333,01:10:07.916,Goddamn fan club.
01:10:12.958,01:10:14.083,"Bonnie, we love you!"
01:11:12.333,01:11:13.833,Damn!
01:11:57.583,01:11:58.708,Damn!
01:12:43.750,01:12:44.625,Yeah.
01:12:51.875,01:12:53.083,Damn it.
01:13:17.166,01:13:19.500,They stopped for a nice breakfast this morning.
01:13:20.833,01:13:22.833,French toast and coffee.
01:13:23.625,01:13:27.125,Clyde ordered himself a soft-boiled egg off the à la carte menu.
01:13:28.875,01:13:30.875,Cute little diner in Amarillo.
01:13:31.666,01:13:33.708,-Amarillo? -Yeah.
01:13:36.041,01:13:37.958,Clyde drove 400 miles last night?
01:13:38.041,01:13:39.791,Four hundred and fifty.
01:13:46.416,01:13:48.625,Maybe it ain't in us no more?
01:14:28.875,01:14:31.083,Oh. Heh.
01:14:31.250,01:14:35.958,He got through a thousand-man dragnet to deliver a bunny to momma.
01:14:42.750,01:14:44.541,I... I just had the one idea.
01:15:58.750,01:16:01.458,"They tell me you're from the highway department, but..."
01:16:08.666,01:16:10.125,I know a killer when I see one.
01:16:10.208,01:16:12.041,"I’m sure you would, Mr. Barrow."
01:16:18.791,01:16:19.750,Um...
01:16:21.458,01:16:23.750,I know y'all gonna have to kill my boy.
01:16:25.541,01:16:26.791,It ain't your fault.
01:16:27.125,01:16:29.916,He's gone past the point of redemption.
01:16:36.458,01:16:37.375,Here.
01:16:39.458,01:16:41.083,He wasn't born that way.
01:16:42.750,01:16:45.500,He-- He wasn’t born with no dark soul.
01:16:50.416,01:16:52.333,That’s what me and Cumie called him.
01:16:53.125,01:16:55.166,He-- He loved bicycles.
01:16:57.500,01:16:59.333,What he really wanted to be was a musician.
01:17:00.333,01:17:04.791,"I mean, sure, he liked to dress fine, and get the girls, and all like that, but..."
01:17:07.916,01:17:09.583,I had high hopes.
01:17:10.916,01:17:15.250,People don't always know who they are... until it's too late.
01:17:15.333,01:17:18.375,"Oh, you mean one turn on the trail, huh?"
01:17:18.708,01:17:19.791,That what you mean?
01:17:20.833,01:17:22.291,He stole a chicken.
01:17:23.541,01:17:32.500,"He stole a goddamn chicken, mister, and the law took him for a bad seed, and from that day forward, he was dogged by the law."
01:17:32.583,01:17:34.083,"-Dogged him? -Yes, sir!"
01:17:36.250,01:17:37.375,Dogged him or watched him?
01:17:37.458,01:17:40.000,I guess it’s all the same to you. You’re a cop.
01:17:40.583,01:17:41.458,"Yes, I am."
01:17:51.833,01:18:05.208,"Growing up, all I ever… I was saving up for the seminary."
01:18:06.625,01:18:08.666,Working for a sharecropper in San Saba.
01:18:10.750,01:18:13.250,Word got out that I was pretty handy with a pistol.
01:18:14.375,01:18:21.041,"The owner, McSwain, called me up to the porch one day and wanted to know if I... wanted to make $150."
01:18:22.125,01:18:29.625,"I laughed and said, “Who do I have to kill?” And he kept staring at me."
01:18:30.750,01:18:31.958,That's when I knew...
01:18:33.125,01:18:37.375,he wasn't talkin' about killin' a coyote or a polecat.
01:18:39.833,01:18:42.666,He was talking about his business partner he wanted dead.
01:18:49.750,01:18:50.875,That wasn't too smart.
01:18:50.958,01:18:52.291,"Well, I was 16!"
01:18:53.833,01:18:54.916,"Like I said, I was..."
01:18:56.041,01:18:57.500,savin' up for the seminary.
01:18:59.458,01:19:00.708,"Couple weeks later, he..."
01:19:01.541,01:19:03.791,asked me to put some groceries in his house.
01:19:05.041,01:19:08.291,"Before I could go in, he pulled a scattergun."
01:19:09.833,01:19:15.583,"Shot me in my head, my back, my leg."
01:19:17.416,01:19:21.416,"For whatever reasons I still don't know, he stepped right over me and went inside."
01:19:22.125,01:19:24.375,"Maybe to reload. I don't know, but I..."
01:19:25.333,01:19:29.250,I scrambled away. Hid... Hid in an irrigation ditch.
01:19:29.791,01:19:32.625,I would’ve died there except for a colored field hand.
01:19:33.250,01:19:34.625,"Came along, found me."
01:19:35.541,01:19:36.875,Carried me home.
01:19:39.041,01:19:40.625,My momma took care of me all summer.
01:19:41.833,01:19:43.000,"Come fall, I..."
01:19:43.833,01:19:45.500,I packed up for the seminary.
01:19:47.500,01:19:49.416,"At least, that's what I told them."
01:19:50.833,01:19:53.958,"And on my way out of town, I rode over to McSwain’s."
01:19:54.916,01:19:56.791,Rang the yard bell. He came out.
01:19:57.791,01:20:04.375,"And I shot that son of a bitch dead right there on that same porch, and there went my callin'."
01:20:05.833,01:20:06.708,Hmm.
01:20:08.458,01:20:16.333,"Turned out McSwain was a wanted man himself, One turn on the trail, huh?"
01:20:16.416,01:20:18.875,"Yes, sir. One turn."
01:20:20.333,01:20:22.083,How come you telling me all this?
01:20:25.333,01:20:27.958,You ever think maybe there was something in Clyde...
01:20:28.916,01:20:31.250,made him steal that chicken in the first place?
01:20:38.416,01:20:39.958,Maybe we were all hungry.
01:20:45.083,01:20:46.083,I won't argue that.
01:20:47.958,01:20:49.416,He ain't gonna surrender.
01:20:52.333,01:20:53.875,You just going to hang him anyhow.
01:21:00.125,01:21:01.958,"You know, your boy may not have been..."
01:21:02.750,01:21:06.541,"born with a dark soul, but he... he has one now."
01:21:06.750,01:21:08.250,"You're not hearing me, mister."
01:21:12.250,01:21:13.958,It ain't easy for me to say.
01:21:15.708,01:21:19.208,I know there's only one way that this thing is ever gonna end.
01:21:25.125,01:21:26.916,"just end it now, damn it."
01:21:28.333,01:21:29.708,End it for my family.
01:21:47.750,01:21:52.000,You call Lee Simmons. Get him to furlough Wade McNabb.
01:21:54.125,01:21:55.541,What a fine idea.
01:22:26.250,01:22:35.208,"I couldn't believe it when Billy Mace said Sixty days. And if I get a job and I do good behavior in that time, it could be full parole."
01:22:35.875,01:22:37.958,"But it ain’t good behavior I got on my mind tonight, sweetie."
01:22:39.416,01:22:40.750,My kind of place.
01:22:46.416,01:22:47.500,"How are you, darling?"
01:22:52.000,01:22:54.208,"So, is it true? You really know Clyde Barrow?"
01:22:54.291,01:22:56.500,"I knew his brother Buck, too, before they shot him dead."
01:23:03.250,01:23:04.750,"Good to be off the farm, Wade?"
01:23:14.958,01:23:17.541,-They wouldn't tell me your name. -Don't need it.
01:23:18.250,01:23:19.083,I dig.
01:23:22.125,01:23:24.833,"Say, you owe me a do-over, slick."
01:23:27.166,01:23:28.000,Or not.
01:23:29.583,01:23:31.208,Where's the water closet?
01:23:44.958,01:23:46.375,"So, what do y'all need me to do?"
01:24:08.916,01:24:12.333,"Say, you bringing the cattle to market, Dad?"
01:24:17.375,01:24:19.375,they’re plannin’ to skin out for Mexico.
01:24:19.541,01:24:20.500,That is the word.
01:24:20.833,01:24:22.041,"What do you know, Joe?"
01:24:24.416,01:24:27.750,"Son, suppose you cut the junior gangster act and get serious."
01:24:27.833,01:24:29.666,"Otherwise, there's nothing you can do for me."
01:24:29.750,01:24:32.750,I'll have Lee Simmons give you a ride back to the farm tonight.
01:24:33.208,01:24:34.083,"Yes, sir."
01:24:37.916,01:24:40.666,You come to the wrong place to dog Wade boy.
01:24:40.750,01:24:41.750,"That's right, old man."
01:24:42.125,01:24:48.916,"You see, Wade Boy runs with Clyde, and around here, Clyde is king."
01:24:59.000,01:25:02.458,"It’s a real mess, you get it point-blank, but I’m happy to do it for you."
01:25:05.291,01:25:07.958,...rob a fella while he’s havin’ himself a pleasant relief.
01:25:08.458,01:25:09.625,Get yourselves in that stall.
01:25:13.541,01:25:17.083,Stay in there till I come back and tell you different.
01:25:28.166,01:25:30.083,Billie Mace is set to fix Bonnie’s hair.
01:25:30.416,01:25:31.833,-When? -Tomorrow.
01:25:32.125,01:25:33.041,Dinnertime.
01:25:33.541,01:25:36.083,Might look like two girls. Sometimes Clyde wears a ladies wig.
01:25:38.500,01:25:40.458,"He done got y'all chasing your own tails, don’t he?"
01:25:40.541,01:25:46.291,"Son, if you're telling the truth, you’ll finish out your term in a nice, civilized federal pen."
01:25:48.375,01:25:53.958,"But you do wrong by me, you’ll be back on the farm, breakin’ rocks, and getting your teeth stove in."
01:25:54.958,01:25:56.125,What took you so long?
01:25:57.333,01:25:58.916,There’s a fella in the toilet.
01:26:16.708,01:26:18.041,Are you Billie Mace?
01:26:24.125,01:26:25.500,You must be Billy Mace.
01:26:57.041,01:27:00.125,"Hey, Granddad. Wanna race again?"
01:27:13.625,01:27:15.791,Didn’t your momma teach you to tie your shoes?
01:27:19.541,01:27:20.375,Uh-uh.
01:27:31.750,01:27:33.833,"-We gonna see each other again? -No, sir."
01:27:38.416,01:27:39.583,Git!
01:27:42.791,01:27:44.750,Git. Downright poetic.
01:27:48.958,01:27:53.458,"Uh, Headed for greener pastures, see you next time around."
01:29:26.541,01:29:28.000,Goddamn animals.
01:30:01.416,01:30:02.291,You did not.
01:30:05.833,01:30:08.875,He would have been out in nine months on his own.
01:30:11.750,01:30:14.750,Fella did not... have to die.
01:30:16.000,01:30:18.250,"Maybe so, but that fella made his own choices."
01:30:22.541,01:30:28.083,"See, Frank, that’s the difference right there between you and me."
01:30:29.916,01:30:45.291,"You could always hide behind some notion of right and wrong. Me, I never particularly liked the weight of the deciding who-- who gets to live and who doesn’t."
01:30:46.333,01:30:48.250,"There’s differences between us, Maney."
01:30:49.833,01:30:52.041,But hiding behind something ain’t one of ‘em.
01:30:54.583,01:30:57.541,"You know, counting McNabb, they’ve killed 13."
01:30:58.041,01:30:59.500,And people call ‘em heroes.
01:31:00.750,01:31:02.791,-Who cares what they call-- -I care!
01:31:04.375,01:31:05.875,People idolize them.
01:31:07.125,01:31:08.541,We need to end this.
01:31:11.000,01:31:14.125,"It's never easy, it's never pretty."
01:31:15.708,01:31:19.083,"But there's always blood at the end of the road, you know that."
01:31:19.583,01:31:21.083,You know that the same as me.
01:31:25.041,01:31:28.875,"I seen a lot a blood, but it ain’t theirs."
01:31:28.958,01:31:34.000,"Goddammit, Maney, why the hell… Why the hell you even come?"
01:32:22.916,01:32:25.791,Though I don't exactly know why.
01:32:37.958,01:32:44.375,"Ma finds out, I don't think I can protect you or myself."
01:32:49.166,01:32:50.166,"I understand, Lee."
01:33:24.291,01:33:25.958,Take me to greener pastures.
01:33:27.625,01:33:32.208,I’ll just get a bottle and sit there and wait for Clyde to show up.
01:33:34.666,01:33:37.083,"Does that mean anything, you think? Headed for..."
01:33:37.791,01:33:38.958,greener pastures.
01:33:40.208,01:33:42.291,Is he headed for a state he hasn't hit yet?
01:33:42.375,01:33:43.208,Could be.
01:33:43.750,01:33:46.666,What... What states have warrants for him?
01:33:47.125,01:33:47.958,Mm.
01:33:48.041,01:33:51.458,"No, better still. What states don't?"
01:33:53.333,01:33:59.458,"New Mexico, uh, Colorado, Louisiana."
01:34:00.291,01:34:02.000,Outlaws always go home.
01:34:08.833,01:34:10.250,"Methvin, where’s he from?"
01:34:11.875,01:34:12.791,Kansas.
01:34:12.875,01:34:14.208,He still have family there?
01:34:15.625,01:34:17.375,"No, his dad..."
01:34:18.625,01:34:20.750,lives in Bienville Parish.
01:34:21.000,01:34:22.375,East of Shreveport.
01:34:46.291,01:34:49.375,Owner lets folk squat in exchange for labor.
01:34:50.375,01:34:52.333,Henry’s daddy hauls wood for ‘em.
01:34:57.000,01:34:58.166,That's his truck right there.
01:35:03.041,01:35:04.166,Ivy Methvin.
01:36:52.166,01:36:53.166,Hmm.
01:39:17.333,01:39:18.500,They're playing house.
01:39:19.083,01:39:20.500,She’s a little bitty thing.
01:39:31.166,01:39:32.250,Huh.
01:40:03.750,01:40:04.625,You all right?
01:40:06.791,01:40:07.625,Yeah.
01:40:09.250,01:40:10.250,Fix the room back.
01:40:33.000,01:40:34.375,Probably best they weren't home.
01:40:34.458,01:40:37.083,We got no jurisdiction to arrest in these parts.
01:40:37.166,01:40:39.333,"Now, we weren’t there to arrest them, Maney."
01:40:40.125,01:40:43.375,"Well, then I suggest we bring in a local sheriff next time."
01:40:44.000,01:40:46.000,"Okay, what if he's in on the hand?"
01:40:47.500,01:40:50.458,"I mean, a corrupt sheriff down this way isn’t exactly remarkable."
01:40:50.541,01:40:52.083,One way to find out.
01:40:59.166,01:41:00.916,Where? North Highway?
01:41:06.125,01:41:12.250,My name is Flavius Kern. I am the Barrow family parson. May I?
01:41:14.541,01:41:18.291,"Now, nobody knows I’m here, and, uh, you never saw me."
01:41:19.291,01:41:41.375,"But, uh, the family is grateful to you They got in a little over their heads, but word is there’s-- there's some heat on ‘em down here, and, uh, I know you never saw 'em, and you never heard they was in your parish, and we’d like to keep it that way."
01:41:41.458,01:41:46.541,"Clyde will try to show his appreciation to you, but the family..."
01:41:49.250,01:41:50.958,would like to show theirs.
01:41:56.833,01:42:00.416,Call it a contribution to the parish church.
01:42:01.250,01:42:03.458,"Now, I won’t take up any more of your time."
01:42:10.458,01:42:13.166,Your boy use a shotgun on that gator or...
01:42:13.250,01:42:15.791,"No, we use a gig, like this here."
01:42:15.875,01:42:19.541,"Listen to me, papere. I see these dogs in Bienville, I shoot ‘em dead."
01:42:22.375,01:42:25.666,"or I'll shoot your ass, too. We not crooks down here."
01:42:25.750,01:42:28.458,"Well, then, you are just the gentleman we're looking for."
01:42:37.125,01:42:41.125,Some men over there lookin’ for somebody to cut and haul wood.
01:42:43.166,01:42:44.291,Say they pay fair.
01:42:45.041,01:42:48.625,"You need some more hands, me and my boy, we needs the work."
01:42:50.375,01:42:51.250,Work right here.
01:42:52.000,01:42:52.833,Get to it.
01:42:53.666,01:42:54.500,"Yes, sir."
01:43:24.541,01:43:27.291,"I’m Sheriff Jordan. This is my deputy, Mr. Oakley."
01:43:27.375,01:43:28.458,"Well, who are you fellas?"
01:43:28.541,01:43:29.750,Doesn’t concern you.
01:43:31.250,01:43:34.916,"All you need to know is Bonnie and Clyde are going down hard, Mr. Methvin."
01:43:35.833,01:43:37.708,"If not by the gun, then by the chair."
01:43:39.250,01:43:42.083,-And your boy Henry is going with them. -My boy didn’t kill nobody.
01:43:42.166,01:43:45.916,"Killed a highway patrolman near Grapevine, Texas."
01:43:46.041,01:43:49.500,"We have a witness, ballistics, the whole book."
01:43:50.625,01:43:52.208,Wiretaps.
01:43:54.708,01:43:56.458,We’re gonna give your son a chance to live.
01:43:56.791,01:43:57.708,How?
01:43:58.625,01:44:00.750,"Well, he’s gonna have to put ‘em on the spot."
01:44:01.416,01:44:03.958,"He does, we’ll put him on the ground, instead of in it."
01:44:04.375,01:44:07.750,"-Meaning you’ll let him go. -As far as Texas is concerned, yes, sir."
01:44:23.916,01:44:27.708,"When you get your boy alone, you tell him to get separated first chance he gets."
01:44:28.250,01:44:30.000,They'll come right back to see him.
01:44:30.333,01:44:31.416,We'll be waiting.
01:44:31.500,01:44:32.666,Why should I trust you?
01:44:33.125,01:44:34.125,Because I said.
01:44:38.625,01:44:41.708,"Uh, that's just how he's built."
01:44:43.125,01:44:44.458,"Well, they got a rule."
01:44:45.166,01:44:50.750,"If they get separated, they wait a couple days for the air to clear and then meet up back at my house."
01:44:54.416,01:44:59.291,"Neither will your boy, sir. Unless he takes his one chance now."
01:45:01.791,01:45:04.000,-Excuse me? -I like my house!
01:45:04.875,01:45:07.833,"Clyde bought it for me, and I don’t want y’all shootin’ it up none."
01:45:07.916,01:45:11.083,"Now, they’ll be around for Henry. There ain't but one way in, one way out."
01:45:11.166,01:45:12.125,That's Ringgold Road.
01:45:13.041,01:45:14.125,Ringgold Road.
01:45:16.333,01:45:17.875,"Once my boy gets clear, you..."
01:45:19.291,01:45:20.708,"Well, you can kill ‘em there."
01:45:22.875,01:45:23.708,All right.
01:46:25.750,01:46:27.000,-Two. -There you go.
01:46:29.500,01:46:32.125,"Looks like we outnumbered by Texans, Sanderson."
01:46:32.208,01:46:45.041,"Yeah, well, we need these Dallas boys, the only ones They got machine guns, hand grenades, thousand round of shells."
01:46:45.125,01:46:46.750,Said it’s like an armory on four wheels.
01:46:46.833,01:46:49.000,"-Well, we'll find out. -Gonna have us a hunt."
01:46:51.416,01:46:53.833,"Dang, if I don't have an Arkansas Straight."
01:46:57.541,01:47:00.750,Dallas paper gave me a camera to film it when it happens.
01:47:01.625,01:47:02.500,Said he’d pay me.
01:47:03.125,01:47:03.958,Y’all believe that?
01:47:05.083,01:47:06.958,What the hell is this world coming to?
01:47:07.291,01:47:08.958,"Well, here we go."
01:47:12.625,01:47:15.708,"Maybe we should put six bills in the pot, homme, make it more interestin’."
01:47:15.791,01:47:21.000,"No, no, no. Cap says, uh, no money in the game, nor drinkin' on Sundays."
01:47:21.083,01:47:22.083,Can't be much fun.
01:47:22.166,01:47:25.625,"Yeah, well, there's a place for me in heaven, I'll tell you that."
01:47:38.125,01:47:42.541,Sheriff Smoot said you and Hamer killed more than 50 men between you.
01:47:48.625,01:47:50.333,Killed more than that one evenin’.
01:47:52.041,01:47:53.125,I didn't mean to pry.
01:47:54.875,01:47:57.041,"It’s all right, kid. Ante up, gents."
01:48:15.666,01:48:18.250,I was young. Younger than you.
01:48:20.125,01:48:22.791,"South Texas, place called Candelario."
01:48:23.958,01:48:25.000,Mm.
01:48:25.166,01:48:26.375,Ranger Company C.
01:48:26.458,01:48:29.833,Had about 60 bandits pinned down in a dry wash.
01:48:29.958,01:48:36.916,"These fellas burned half a dozen ranches, killed a dozen, raped just about as many."
01:48:40.041,01:48:45.125,"every time we’d ride in there to take ‘em, we’d yell out, Manos arribas."
01:48:45.208,01:48:47.041,"You know, uh, Hands up."
01:48:48.833,01:48:54.958,"Well, they'd fire on us, and we’d lose a man. Went on like that for two days."
01:48:55.833,01:48:59.291,"So, they sent down young Captain Hamer."
01:48:59.958,01:49:01.458,My friend Pancho.
01:49:03.083,01:49:06.958,"Cap says, What's going on down here?"
01:49:07.625,01:49:15.375,"Any time we yell out, 'manos arribas,' like the law tells us to, they open up on us."
01:49:15.916,01:49:25.708,"Cap says, “Well, we’re going in there afore dawn and, this time, don’t no-damn-body yell out 'manos arribas.' Heh."
01:49:30.958,01:49:32.625,"Well, that night..."
01:49:33.791,01:49:35.875,them bandits were celebrating. Drunk.
01:49:37.416,01:49:39.166,Most of them asleep by the fire.
01:49:39.291,01:49:40.250,We went in.
01:49:42.333,01:49:44.500,Some of the boys refused to go.
01:49:44.708,01:49:47.791,Refused to just start shooting men.
01:49:50.541,01:49:54.416,"But I went with Frank. Like I said, he's my friend."
01:49:57.000,01:49:58.208,He gave me the nod.
01:49:59.625,01:50:00.875,We let 'em have it.
01:50:00.958,01:50:05.541,We shot that arroyo all to hell before most of them fellas even woke up.
01:50:10.416,01:50:13.166,I was... jittery.
01:50:17.208,01:50:21.000,"A mule came out from behind a cactus, and I, uh..."
01:50:22.333,01:50:25.583,shot the man riding it a half dozen times.
01:50:28.750,01:50:33.375,Turned out to be a... 13-year-old boy just...
01:50:48.250,01:50:52.166,Whole thing was over in five minutes. Counted 54 dead.
01:50:53.416,01:51:01.458,"Counting was over, Cap sat on a rock, holstered his gun, and said, Manos arribas, you sons of bitches."
01:51:08.750,01:51:13.000,"Came back, governor gave us all medals."
01:51:32.833,01:51:33.875,My boy got loose.
01:52:05.500,01:52:08.166,"When he comes, he-- he gonna be comin' from the south."
01:52:08.333,01:52:09.666,Which will bring him right by you.
01:52:10.875,01:52:12.500,"Well, I figure you fellas got it from here."
01:52:13.458,01:52:14.291,Ivy.
01:52:14.958,01:52:17.375,"Turn your truck around, park at the wrong side."

01:52:19.625,01:52:20.791,You're staying with us.
01:52:20.916,01:52:22.583,"No, that wasn't part of the deal."
01:52:23.041,01:52:25.541,"The deal ain’t done till it’s done. Now, park it."
01:52:25.916,01:52:28.583,Jack up the front right bumper and take off your tire!
01:52:32.875,01:52:34.541,Clyde’ll slow down and help him change it.
01:52:38.416,01:52:40.416,How do I know I ain't gonna get shot?

01:53:30.000,01:53:31.083,"Yeah. Yes, sir."
01:53:32.833,01:53:41.791,"We need you to identify these two, but nobody said nothin' about having to pull the trigger, which means you don't have to."
01:53:42.125,01:53:43.041,I'll be all right.
01:53:43.541,01:53:44.375,Sure?
01:53:45.750,01:53:46.583,Yeah.
01:54:10.791,01:54:14.541,"When they get here, y’all... stay behind the blind."

01:55:11.916,01:55:13.916,you only move like you're 75.
01:55:34.000,01:55:36.041,I wanted to spare you this.
01:55:39.541,01:55:40.416,"That said, I’m..."

01:59:15.000,01:59:16.250,Manos arribas.
02:01:16.583,02:01:17.541,Mr. Hamer?
02:01:18.333,02:01:19.791,"Excuse me, Mr. Hamer?"
02:01:19.875,02:01:22.250,There’s a fella on the phone from the Associated Press in New York.
02:01:22.333,02:01:25.416,"He says he’ll give you $1,000 for a phone interview right now."
02:01:26.958,02:01:28.583,Got him on the line in the back.
02:01:33.250,02:01:34.166,Mr. Hamer?
02:01:37.416,02:01:38.625,Shame on you.
02:02:27.416,02:02:33.875,"Retribution has been served, and J. Edgar Hoover has issued a formal announcement that the crime spree of Bonnie and Clyde..."
02:02:40.625,02:02:44.125,Would you care to comment on your role in the apprehension of Bonnie and Clyde?
02:02:44.208,02:02:48.208,"I knew Hamer and Gault would get the job done, and that’s why I chose ‘em."
02:02:48.458,02:02:49.541,Bottom line.
