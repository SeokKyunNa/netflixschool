00:02:26.228,00:02:28.730,Doc. Doc! Doc.
00:02:28.814,00:02:30.816,Doc! Doc!
00:02:30.900,00:02:34.695,"Okay. Relax. Doc, it’s me. It’s me! It’s Marty."
00:02:34.779,00:02:37.322,No. It can’t be. Just sent you back to the future.
00:02:37.406,00:02:40.492,"I know. You did send me back to the future, but I’m back."
00:02:40.576,00:02:42.578,I’m back from the future.
00:02:45.790,00:02:48.250,Great Scott!
00:05:21.028,00:05:24.198,Howdy Doody Time?
00:05:27.785,00:05:32.414,"Date: Sunday, November 13, 1955, 7:01 a.m."
00:05:32.498,00:05:35.917,Last night’s time-travel experiment was apparently a complete success.
00:05:36.001,00:05:41.631,"Lightning struck the clock tower at precisely 10:04 p.m., sending the necessary 1.21 gigawatts into the time vehicle..."
00:05:41.715,00:05:46.303,"which vanished in a brilliant flash of light, leaving a pair of fire trails behind."
00:05:46.387,00:05:49.014,"I, therefore, assume that Marty and the time vehicle were transported..."
00:05:49.098,00:05:52.392,forward through time into the year 1985.
00:05:54.103,00:05:56.521,"After that, I can’t recall what happened."
00:05:56.605,00:05:59.399,"In fact, I don’t even remember how I got home."
00:05:59.483,00:06:09.701,"Perhaps the gigawatt discharge, coupled with the temporal displacement field generated by the time vehicle, caused a disruption of my own brain waves, resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia."
00:06:09.785,00:06:11.244,"Indeed, I now recall..."
00:06:11.328,00:06:29.513,"that moments after the time vehicle disappeared into the future– Hey, Doc? Doc. Undoubtedly, this was some sort of residual image– Doc, calm down, okay?"
00:06:29.597,00:06:31.515,Just calm down! It’s me! It’s Marty!
00:06:31.599,00:06:34.017,No! It can’t be you! I sent you back to the future!
00:06:34.101,00:06:37.062,"That’s right, Doc. But I came back again. I came back from the future."
00:06:37.146,00:06:39.439,Don’t you remember last night? You fainted. I brought you home!
00:06:39.523,00:06:42.067,This can’t be happening! You can’t be here!
00:06:42.151,00:06:45.654,It doesn’t make sense for you to be here! I refuse to even believe you are here!
00:06:45.738,00:06:47.656,"Doc, I am here, and it does make sense."
00:06:47.740,00:06:53.411,"Look, I came back to 1955 again with you, the you from 1985, ’cause we had to get a book from Biff."
00:06:53.495,00:07:00.043,"Once I got the book back, you– the you from 1985– were in the DeLorean and it got struck by lightning, and we got sent back to 1885!"
00:07:00.127,00:07:01.795,1885?
00:07:03.797,00:07:09.261,"It’s a very interesting story, future boy, but there’s just one little thing that doesn’t make sense."
00:07:09.345,00:07:14.307,"If the me of the future is now in the past, how could you possibly know about it?"
00:07:14.391,00:07:16.059,You sent me a letter.
00:07:16.143,00:07:22.482,"Dear Marty, If my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning."
00:07:22.566,00:07:25.318,"First, let me assure you that I am alive and well."
00:07:25.402,00:07:29.531,I’ve been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.
00:07:29.615,00:07:32.284,The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean caused a gigawatt overload...
00:07:32.368,00:07:35.745,"which scrambled the time circuits, activated the flux capacitor..."
00:07:35.829,00:07:38.748,and sent me back to 1885.
00:07:38.832,00:07:42.627,The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits.
00:07:42.711,00:07:45.297,"Unfortunately, the car will never fly again."
00:07:45.381,00:07:46.881,It actually flew?
00:07:46.965,00:07:50.051,"Yeah. Well, you had a hover conversion done in the early 21st century."
00:07:50.135,00:07:52.178,Incredible!
00:07:52.262,00:07:55.181,I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front...
00:07:55.265,00:07:58.518,while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits.
00:07:58.602,00:08:01.980,"Unfortunately, this proved impossible because suitable replacement parts..."
00:08:02.064,00:08:05.525,will not be invented until 1947.
00:08:05.609,00:08:10.656,"However, I’ve gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons."
00:08:11.657,00:08:13.950,1885!
00:08:14.034,00:08:18.079,Amazing! I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Old West.
00:08:18.163,00:08:19.706,"Pretty heavy, huh?"
00:08:19.790,00:08:27.505,"I have buried the DeLorean in the abandoned Delgado Mine, adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery as shown on the enclosed map."
00:08:27.589,00:08:29.674,"Hopefully, it should remain undisturbed and preserved..."
00:08:29.758,00:08:33.845,until you uncover it in 1955.
00:08:33.929,00:08:37.599,"Inside, you will find repair instructions."
00:08:37.683,00:08:45.482,My 1955 counterpart– That’s me– should have no problem repairing it so that you can drive it back to the future.
00:08:45.566,00:08:49.527,"Once you have returned to 1985, destroy the time machine."
00:08:49.611,00:08:51.112,Destroy it?
00:08:51.196,00:08:54.240,"Yeah, well, it’s a long story, Doc."
00:08:54.324,00:08:59.371,Do not– I repeat– Do not attempt to come back here to get me.
00:08:59.455,00:09:08.296,"I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air and wide-open spaces, and I fear that unnecessary time travel only risks further disruption..."
00:09:08.380,00:09:10.465,of the space-time continuum.
00:09:10.549,00:09:13.969,And please take care of Einstein for me.
00:09:15.512,00:09:17.806,"Einstein? He’s your dog, Doc."
00:09:17.890,00:09:21.101,Einstein. It’s what you call your dog in 1985.
00:09:24.062,00:09:26.064,I know you will give him a good home.
00:09:26.148,00:09:30.235,Remember to walk him twice a day and that he only likes canned dog food.
00:09:30.319,00:09:33.405,These are my wishes. Please respect them and follow them.
00:09:33.489,00:09:35.865,"And so, Marty, I now say farewell..."
00:09:35.949,00:09:37.867,and wish you Godspeed.
00:09:37.951,00:09:43.373,"You’ve been a good, kind and loyal friend to me, and you made a real difference in my life."
00:09:43.457,00:09:45.709,I will always treasure our relationship...
00:09:45.793,00:09:52.716,"and think on you with fond memories, warm feelings and a special place in my heart."
00:09:52.800,00:09:55.468,"Your friend in time, Doc."
00:09:55.552,00:09:59.723,"Emmett L. Brown, September 1, 1885."
00:10:01.433,00:10:05.103,I never knew I could write anything so touching.
00:10:08.190,00:10:11.151,"It’s all right, Copernicus. Everything’s gonna be fine."
00:10:11.235,00:10:14.028,"I’m sorry, Doc. It’s all my fault you’re stuck back there."
00:10:14.112,00:10:16.030,I never should have let Biff get to me.
00:10:16.114,00:10:18.992,"Well, there are plenty worse places to be than the Old West."
00:10:19.076,00:10:20.785,I could’ve ended up in the Dark Ages.
00:10:20.869,00:10:24.289,They probably would have burned me at the stake as a heretic or something.
00:10:24.373,00:10:26.124,Let’s look at the map.
00:10:26.208,00:10:30.837,"All right, according to this, the time vehicle’s sealed off in a side tunnel."
00:10:30.921,00:10:32.548,We may have to blast.
00:10:45.185,00:10:47.645,Whoa.
00:10:47.729,00:10:49.856,I think you woke up the dead with that blast.
00:10:49.940,00:10:52.693,Take this camera. I want to document everything!
00:10:55.028,00:10:58.823,This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the earth.
00:10:58.907,00:11:01.534,"I’d been reading my favorite author, Jules Verne."
00:11:01.618,00:11:04.996,I spent weeks preparing that expedition. I didn’t even get this far.
00:11:05.080,00:11:07.832,"Course, I was only 12 at the time."
00:11:07.916,00:11:13.713,"You know, in his writings, Jules Verne had a profound effect on my life."
00:11:13.797,00:11:17.675,It was when I was 11 that I first read Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.
00:11:17.759,00:11:22.764,It was then that I realized that I must devote my life to science.
00:11:22.848,00:11:25.767,"Doc, check it out. Look at this."
00:11:28.937,00:11:32.690,My initials! Just like in Journey to the Center of the Earth.
00:11:32.774,00:11:35.736,That means the time machine must be right through this wall.
00:11:58.800,00:12:02.720,"It’s been buried here for 70 years, two months and 13 days."
00:12:02.804,00:12:03.972,Astounding!
00:12:05.641,00:12:09.770,the lightning bolt shorted out the time circuit control microchip.
00:12:11.355,00:12:14.524,The attached sch– schem– Schematic.
00:12:14.608,00:12:16.526,schematic diagram...
00:12:16.610,00:12:23.241,"will allow you to build a replacement unit with 1955 components, thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order."
00:12:23.325,00:12:27.496,Unbelievable that this little piece of junk could be such a big problem.
00:12:30.332,00:12:33.251,"No wonder this circuit failed. It says, Made in Japan."
00:12:35.003,00:12:38.465,"What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan."
00:12:40.425,00:12:41.926,Unbelievable.
00:12:48.141,00:12:53.438,"You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be a cowboy."
00:12:53.522,00:13:00.028,"And now, knowing I’m going to spend my future in the past, sounds like a wonderful way to spend my retirement years."
00:13:00.112,00:13:01.613,"It just occurred to me, Marty."
00:13:01.697,00:13:05.283,"Since I end up in 1885, perhaps I’m now in the history books."
00:13:05.367,00:13:10.997,I wonder– Could I go to the library and look myself up in the old newspaper archives?
00:13:11.081,00:13:12.749,"I don’t know, Doc."
00:13:12.833,00:13:15.960,You’re always saying it’s not good to know too much about your own destiny.
00:13:16.044,00:13:19.464,"You’re right, Marty. I know too much already."
00:13:19.548,00:13:23.927,Better that I not attempt to uncover the circumstances of my own future.
00:13:25.053,00:13:27.805,"Copernicus! Come on, boy!"
00:13:27.889,00:13:30.642,"I’ll get him, Doc. Copernicus!"
00:13:37.733,00:13:39.609,"What’s wrong, Copernicus? Come on."
00:13:40.819,00:13:42.779,Come on. Let’s go home. Come on.
00:13:47.409,00:13:50.662,Doc! Doc! Come here!
00:13:50.746,00:13:52.330,Quick!
00:13:53.707,00:13:57.293,"What’s wrong, Marty? You look like you’ve seen a ghost."
00:13:57.377,00:13:59.379,"You’re not far off, Doc."
00:14:03.717,00:14:05.301,Great Scott!
00:14:05.385,00:14:06.886,Check this out.
00:14:06.970,00:14:11.849,"Died September 7, 1885. That’s one week after you wrote the letter!"
00:14:11.933,00:14:15.603,Erected in eternal memory by his beloved Clara.
00:14:15.687,00:14:17.522,Who the hell is Clara?
00:14:17.606,00:14:19.357,"Marty, please, don’t stand there!"
00:14:19.441,00:14:21.025,Oh! Right. Sorry.
00:14:21.109,00:14:23.070,I gotta get another picture.
00:14:27.115,00:14:28.574,over a matter of 80 dollars?
00:14:28.658,00:14:31.369,What kind of a future do you call that?
00:14:34.831,00:14:45.258,"whose short temper and a tendency to drool earned him the nickname ‘Mad Dog.’ He was quick on the trigger and bragged that he had killed 12 men, not including Indians or Chinamen."
00:14:45.342,00:14:48.052,Does it mention me? Am I one of the 12?
00:14:48.136,00:14:51.723,"However, this claim cannot be substantiated, since precise records were not kept..."
00:14:51.807,00:14:53.641,after Tannen shot a newspaper editor...
00:14:53.725,00:14:56.352,who printed an unfavorable story about him in 1884.
00:14:56.436,00:14:58.647,That’s why we can’t find anything.
00:15:00.232,00:15:03.067,William McFly and family. Your relatives?
00:15:03.151,00:15:06.029,My great-grandfather’s name was William.
00:15:06.113,00:15:08.782,That’s him. Good-looking guy.
00:15:10.283,00:15:13.661,"- McFlys, but no Browns. - Maybe it was a mistake, Doc."
00:15:13.745,00:15:17.373,Maybe that grave wasn’t yours. There could’ve been another Emmett Brown back in 1885.
00:15:17.457,00:15:19.542,No.
00:15:19.626,00:15:21.753,The Browns didn’t come to Hill Valley until 1908.
00:15:21.837,00:15:25.882,Then they were the Von Brauns. My father changed our name during the first World War.
00:15:25.966,00:15:27.258,"Doc, look."
00:15:29.469,00:15:32.513,Great Scott! It’s me!
00:15:32.597,00:15:35.266,Then it is true. All of it.
00:15:35.350,00:15:37.268,It is me who goes back there...
00:15:37.352,00:15:39.062,and gets shot.
00:15:39.146,00:15:41.564,"It’s not going to happen, Doc."
00:15:41.648,00:15:48.405,"After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean, I’m goin’ back to 1885, and I’m bringing you home."
00:15:59.749,00:16:01.667,The clothes fit?
00:16:01.751,00:16:05.421,"Yeah. Everything except the boots, Doc. They’re kind of tight."
00:16:05.505,00:16:07.799,You sure this stuff is authentic?
00:16:07.883,00:16:11.219,Of course! Haven’t you ever seen a Western?
00:16:11.303,00:16:17.184,"Yeah, I have, Doc, and Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this."
00:16:18.393,00:16:19.977,Clint who?
00:16:20.061,00:16:22.105,That’s right. You haven’t heard of him yet.
00:16:22.189,00:16:23.981,"Marty, you have to wear the boots."
00:16:24.065,00:16:26.692,You can’t wear those futuristic things back in 1885!
00:16:26.776,00:16:28.778,You shouldn’t even be wearing them here in 1955!
00:16:28.862,00:16:31.155,As soon as I get there I’ll put them on.
00:16:31.239,00:16:32.990,Okay. I think we’re about ready!
00:16:33.074,00:16:36.035,I put gas in the tank. Your future clothes are packed.
00:16:36.119,00:16:39.997,"Just in case, fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies."
00:16:40.081,00:16:41.917,"Oh, what about that floating device?"
00:16:42.876,00:16:44.628,Hoverboard.
00:16:46.838,00:16:50.299,"Doc, it’s gonna be a hell of a long walk back to Hill Valley from here."
00:16:50.383,00:16:51.968,Still the safest plan.
00:16:52.052,00:16:54.428,We can’t risk sending you back into a populated area...
00:16:54.512,00:16:56.848,or to a spot that’s geographically unknown.
00:16:56.932,00:17:00.309,You don’t want to crash into some tree that once existed in the past.
00:17:00.393,00:17:05.523,"This is all completely open country, so you’ll have plenty of runoff space when you arrive."
00:17:05.607,00:17:08.609,"Remember, where you are going there are no roads."
00:17:08.693,00:17:12.405,There’s a small cave over there which will be a perfect place to hide the time vehicle.
00:17:12.489,00:17:16.368,"Well, the new time circuit control tubes are warmed up."
00:17:19.204,00:17:20.830,Time circuits on.
00:17:20.914,00:17:27.879,"I wrote the letter September 1. We’ll send you back the next day– September 2. That’s a Wednesday. September 2, 1885, 8:00 a.m."
00:17:27.963,00:17:30.506,I get shot on Monday the 7th. You’ll have five days.
00:17:30.590,00:17:34.051,"According to my letter, I’m a blacksmith, so I probably have a shop somewhere."
00:17:34.135,00:17:40.308,"All you have to do is drive the time vehicle directly toward that screen, accelerating to 88 miles an hour!"
00:17:40.392,00:17:41.976,"Wait a minute, Doc."
00:17:42.060,00:17:44.979,"If I drive straight toward the screen, I’m gonna crash into those Indians."
00:17:45.063,00:17:48.399,"Marty, you’re not thinking fourth-dimensionally."
00:17:48.483,00:17:52.988,"You’ll instantly be transported to 1885, and those Indians won’t even be there."
00:17:54.155,00:17:56.157,Right.
00:17:54.155,00:18:01.830,Well– Good luck for both of our sakes. See you in the future.
00:18:02.914,00:18:05.000,You mean the past.
00:18:12.090,00:18:13.842,"Happy trails, Marty!"
00:18:18.513,00:18:20.932,"Ready, Marty?"
00:18:21.016,00:18:22.975,Ready!
00:18:23.059,00:18:24.310,Set!
00:18:24.394,00:18:26.271,"Hi-Yo, Silver."
00:18:37.532,00:18:40.117,¡Vaya con Dios!
00:19:03.058,00:19:05.310,Indians!
00:19:44.182,00:19:46.309,The cave!
00:20:26.015,00:20:28.143,Shit! The cavalry!
00:21:18.359,00:21:20.403,Damn. I ripped a fuel line.
00:22:17.335,00:22:20.004,"Mom? Mom, is that you?"
00:22:20.088,00:22:24.758,"There, there, now. You’ve been asleep for nearly six hours now."
00:22:24.842,00:22:27.511,I had this horrible nightmare.
00:22:27.595,00:22:33.476,I dreamed I was– I dreamed I was in a Western.
00:22:33.560,00:22:37.313,I was being chased by all these Indians...
00:22:38.481,00:22:40.232,and a bear.
00:22:40.316,00:22:43.611,"Well, you’re safe and sound here now at the McFly farm."
00:22:54.706,00:22:58.459,Who are you?
00:22:58.543,00:23:02.087,McFly? Maggie?
00:23:02.171,00:23:05.216,"That’s Mrs. McFly, and don’t you be forgettin’ the Mrs."
00:23:05.300,00:23:08.469,"And what might your name be, sir?"
00:23:05.300,00:23:14.767,"Well, it’s Mc– Eastwood?"
00:23:14.851,00:23:17.895,"Uh, Clint– Clint Eastwood."
00:23:17.979,00:23:20.022,"Well, you hit your head, Mr. Eastwood."
00:23:20.106,00:23:23.734,Not too serious. But lucky for you Seamus found you when he did.
00:23:23.818,00:23:25.736,Seamus?
00:23:28.823,00:23:31.826,"You’ll be excusin’ me, Mr. Eastwood, while I tend to William."
00:23:44.339,00:23:46.257,That’s William?
00:23:46.341,00:23:49.843,"William Sean McFly, the first of our family to be born in America."
00:23:49.927,00:23:52.263,"Oh, that’s okay, Will."
00:23:52.347,00:23:55.849,This here’s Mr. Clint Eastwood here visitin’.
00:23:55.933,00:23:58.019,"Sure’n he likes you, Mr. Eastwood."
00:23:59.020,00:24:00.521,Maggie!
00:24:02.315,00:24:03.774,I’ve got supper.
00:24:03.858,00:24:07.444,"I’m not one to pry into a man’s personal affairs, but..."
00:24:07.528,00:24:10.906,exactly how is it that you came to be way out here...
00:24:10.990,00:24:12.658,without a horse...
00:24:12.742,00:24:14.201,or boots...
00:24:14.285,00:24:15.786,or a hat?
00:24:15.870,00:24:22.793,"Well, my ca– horse broke down, and-and a bear ate my boots, and I guess I just forgot my hat."
00:24:22.877,00:24:25.129,How could you forget a thing like your hat?
00:24:25.213,00:24:28.800,"Uh, yeah."
00:24:38.393,00:24:41.395,"I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Mr. Eastwood."
00:24:41.479,00:24:43.856,I’ll help you find your blacksmith friend.
00:24:45.108,00:24:48.319,You can stay the night in the barn.
00:24:48.403,00:24:51.447,"And tomorrow, I’ll take you as far as the railroad tracks."
00:24:51.531,00:24:53.991,You can follow ’em straight on into town.
00:25:06.879,00:25:09.340,"Ah, that’s quite a William."
00:25:09.424,00:25:12.426,That’s quite a William.
00:25:12.510,00:25:14.554,Sweet Will. Oh.
00:25:16.514,00:25:18.474,Yes.
00:25:18.558,00:25:21.101,I think you’ll find the barn comfortable.
00:25:21.185,00:25:23.896,Never had any complaints about it from the pigs.
00:25:23.980,00:25:26.190,Mmm. Seamus.
00:25:26.274,00:25:28.776,A word with you.
00:25:32.280,00:25:34.282,Will you hold him for a minute?
00:25:38.619,00:25:42.873,"Are you sure you’re not after bringin’ a curse on this house, taking him in like that?"
00:25:42.957,00:25:44.708,He’s such a strange young man.
00:25:44.792,00:25:51.548,"But I’ve just got a feelin’ about him, Maggie, that lookin’ after him’s the right thing to do, that it’s important."
00:25:53.384,00:25:55.678,Look how the baby takes to him.
00:25:55.762,00:25:58.139,Little Will never takes to strangers.
00:25:59.474,00:26:03.435,It’s almost as if... he’s connected to us.
00:26:03.519,00:26:06.980,"So, you’re my great-grandfather."
00:26:07.064,00:26:08.982,The first McFly born in America.
00:26:15.031,00:26:17.325,And you peed on me.
00:27:07.625,00:27:10.127,"Give me some soap, Wang."
00:27:20.221,00:27:21.556,"Easy, boy."
00:28:57.068,00:28:59.987,Take a look and see what just breezed in the door.
00:29:02.823,00:29:05.367,"Why, I didn’t know the circus was in town."
00:29:05.451,00:29:08.954,Must’ve got that shirt off’n a dead Chinee.
00:29:28.808,00:29:30.684,"What’ll it be, stranger?"
00:29:30.768,00:29:40.694,"Uh, I’ll have a– Water?"
00:29:40.778,00:29:44.156,"You want water, you better go dunk your head in the horse trough out there."
00:29:45.825,00:29:49.370,In here... we pour whiskey.
00:29:59.422,00:30:01.840,Excuse me.
00:30:01.924,00:30:03.551,I’m tryin’ to find the blacksmith.
00:30:05.553,00:30:07.888,"Hey, McFly!"
00:30:09.223,00:30:15.354,"Thought I done told you never to come in– Hey, you ain’t Seamus McFly."
00:30:17.148,00:30:20.400,"You look like him though, especially with that dog-ugly hat."
00:30:23.571,00:30:25.364,You kin to that hay barber?
00:30:25.448,00:30:27.324,"What’s your name, dude?"
00:30:27.408,00:30:32.038,"Uh, Mart– Eastwood."
00:30:33.039,00:30:34.706,Clint Eastwood.
00:30:36.542,00:30:38.835,What kind of stupid name is that?
00:30:38.919,00:30:41.088,I’d say he’s the runt of the litter.
00:30:41.172,00:30:43.757,"Boys, would you take a look-see at these pearly whites!"
00:30:43.841,00:30:46.259,"Hell, I ain’t seen teeth look that straight that weren’t store-bought."
00:30:46.343,00:30:49.680,Take a gander at them moccasins. What kind of skins is them?
00:30:49.764,00:30:52.432,What’s that writin’ mean? Neekay? What is that?
00:30:52.516,00:30:56.020,Some sort of Injun talk or somethin’?
00:30:57.480,00:31:00.857,"Bartender, I’m lookin’ for that no-good, cheatin’ blacksmith."
00:31:00.941,00:31:04.779,"- You seen him? - No, sir, Mr. Tannen. I have not."
00:31:05.863,00:31:07.864,Tannen?
00:31:07.948,00:31:09.450,You’re Mad Dog Tannen.
00:31:15.831,00:31:19.126,Mad Dog? I hate that name.
00:31:19.960,00:31:22.629,I hate it! You hear?
00:31:22.713,00:31:25.465,Nobody calls me Mad Dog!
00:31:25.549,00:31:29.637,"Especially not some duded-up, egg-suckin’ gutter trash!"
00:31:33.140,00:31:34.891,- Aah! - Come on!
00:31:49.490,00:31:50.950,Shit!
00:31:52.034,00:31:53.994,Whoo!
00:32:02.253,00:32:03.796,Ooh.
00:32:12.221,00:32:14.306,"You better run, squirrel."
00:32:14.390,00:32:16.058,Aah! Get ’im!
00:32:19.019,00:32:20.688,Get ’im! Get ’im!
00:32:23.399,00:32:24.525,Get him!
00:32:44.920,00:32:46.880,Ohh! Ohh!
00:33:09.153,00:33:11.197,Aah!
00:33:19.914,00:33:22.666,We got ourselves a new courthouse.
00:33:56.116,00:33:59.536,"It’ll shoot the fleas off a dog’s back at 500 yards, Tannen!"
00:33:59.620,00:34:02.623,And it’s pointed straight at your head!
00:34:11.840,00:34:13.425,"You owe me money, blacksmith."
00:34:13.509,00:34:16.636,How do ya figure?
00:34:16.720,00:34:19.556,"Seein’ as you was the one that done the shoeing, that makes you responsible."
00:34:19.640,00:34:23.894,"Since you never paid me for the job, I say that makes us even."
00:34:23.978,00:34:27.898,"Wrong! See, I was on my horse when it threw the shoe, and I got throwed off!"
00:34:27.982,00:34:32.277,And that caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky red-eye.
00:34:32.361,00:34:38.825,"So, the way I figure it, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey and $75 for the horse."
00:34:40.661,00:34:45.248,"Look, if your horse threw a shoe, bring him back and I’ll reshoe him!"
00:34:45.332,00:34:49.252,"- I done shot that horse! - Well, that’s your problem, Tannen!"
00:34:49.336,00:34:52.297,Wrong! That’s yours.
00:34:52.381,00:34:56.134,"So, from now on, you better be lookin’ behind you when you walk."
00:34:56.218,00:34:58.804,’Cause one day you’re gonna get a bullet in your back.
00:35:00.055,00:35:02.891,Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Come on! Hyah!
00:35:02.975,00:35:04.643,Hyah! Hyah! Whoo! Whoo!
00:35:04.727,00:35:06.395,Come on! Hyah! Hyah!
00:35:08.856,00:35:11.942,- Doc! - Marty?
00:35:12.026,00:35:17.280,"I gave you explicit instructions not to come here, but to go directly back to 1985."
00:35:17.364,00:35:20.033,"I know, Doc, but I had to come."
00:35:20.117,00:35:23.329,"But it’s good to see you, Marty."
00:35:27.458,00:35:29.459,You’re gonna have to do something about those clothes.
00:35:29.543,00:35:32.462,"You walk around town dressed like that, you’re liable to get shot."
00:35:32.546,00:35:33.964,Or hanged.
00:35:34.048,00:35:36.758,What idiot dressed you in that outfit?
00:35:36.842,00:35:38.385,You did.
00:35:41.347,00:35:45.684,Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of $80?
00:35:45.768,00:35:47.894,September 7?
00:35:47.978,00:35:50.063,That’s this Monday!
00:35:50.147,00:35:52.607,"Now, I wish I’d paid him off."
00:35:56.945,00:35:58.530,"I don’t know, Doc."
00:35:59.823,00:36:02.659,I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.
00:36:02.743,00:36:07.122,My involvement in such a social relationship here in 1885...
00:36:07.206,00:36:11.334,could result in a disruption of the space-time continuum.
00:36:17.132,00:36:19.509,Certainly not after what we’ve already been through.
00:36:19.593,00:36:22.262,"Emmett! Ho, Emmett!"
00:36:22.346,00:36:24.973,Hubert! It’s the mayor!
00:36:25.057,00:36:27.267,"Excuse me, Emmett."
00:36:27.351,00:36:29.269,You remember last week at the town meeting...
00:36:29.353,00:36:32.564,when you volunteered to meet the new schoolteacher at the station when she came in?
00:36:32.648,00:36:36.192,"Oh, yes, quite so."
00:36:36.276,00:36:41.698,"- Here are the details for you. Thanks for all your help. - Anytime, Hubert!"
00:36:41.782,00:36:43.074,Oh!
00:36:43.158,00:36:44.659,Her name’s Miss Clayton.
00:36:44.743,00:36:46.453,Clara Clayton.
00:36:54.461,00:37:00.216,"Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is."
00:37:00.300,00:37:02.677,Marty. It’s impossible.
00:37:02.761,00:37:06.556,The idea that I could fall in love at first sight is romantic nonsense.
00:37:06.640,00:37:08.975,There’s no scientific rationale for that.
00:37:09.059,00:37:11.478,"Aw, come on, Doc. It’s not science."
00:37:11.562,00:37:14.022,"You meet the right girl, it just hits you. It’s like lightning."
00:37:14.106,00:37:18.234,"Please, don’t say that!"
00:37:18.318,00:37:21.321,We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other.
00:37:21.405,00:37:23.406,"God, Jennifer! Damn! I hope she’s all right."
00:37:23.490,00:37:25.909,I can’t believe we just left her there on the porch.
00:37:25.993,00:37:28.119,"Don’t worry, Marty. She’ll be fine."
00:37:28.203,00:37:31.998,"When you burned the almanac in 1955, the normal time line was restored."
00:37:32.082,00:37:35.835,"Once we’re back in 1985, you just have to go over to her house and wake her up."
00:37:38.338,00:37:41.257,Turn that valve over there. All the way to the right!
00:37:41.341,00:37:44.636,"Yeah! Pull it all the way around! Okay, let’s go!"
00:37:58.775,00:38:00.402,Iced tea?
00:38:00.486,00:38:02.362,"No, thanks."
00:38:02.446,00:38:04.280,It’s a refrigerator.
00:38:04.364,00:38:08.118,"Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation."
00:38:08.202,00:38:11.329,"I never meet the woman, there’s no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right?"
00:38:11.413,00:38:13.331,"You’re the doc, Doc."
00:38:13.415,00:38:15.959,We’ll get the DeLorean and get ourselves back to the future.
00:38:16.043,00:38:21.339,"I tore a hole in the gas tank when I was landin’, so we’re going to have to patch it up and get some gas."
00:38:21.423,00:38:23.758,"You mean, we’re out of gas?"
00:38:23.842,00:38:26.553,"Yeah. It’s no big deal. We got Mr. Fusion, right?"
00:38:26.637,00:38:33.309,"Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor, but the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline."
00:38:33.393,00:38:35.311,It always has.
00:38:35.395,00:38:39.941,There’s not gonna be a gas station around here until sometime in the next century.
00:38:40.025,00:38:45.697,"Without gasoline, we can’t get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour."
00:38:47.574,00:38:49.033,"So, what do we do?"
00:38:57.751,00:39:01.004,Hyah! Hyah!
00:39:01.088,00:39:03.006,"It’s no use, Marty!"
00:39:03.090,00:39:07.677,"Even the fastest horse in the world won’t run more than 35, 40 miles an hour."
00:39:07.761,00:39:10.346,Hyah!
00:39:10.430,00:39:12.349,Hyah! Hyah!
00:39:19.189,00:39:21.524,Bartender says that’s the strongest stuff they got.
00:39:21.608,00:39:24.611,"Try it, Marty."
00:39:34.496,00:39:36.832,Give it more gas!
00:39:45.716,00:39:47.301,Damn!
00:39:48.802,00:39:51.221,It blew the fuel injection manifold.
00:39:51.305,00:39:53.389,"That’s strong stuff, all right."
00:39:53.473,00:39:56.518,It’ll take me a month to rebuild it.
00:39:56.602,00:39:59.395,"A month? Doc, you’re gonna get shot on Monday!"
00:39:59.479,00:40:02.106,I know! I know! I know!
00:40:02.190,00:40:05.068,I wish– Wait.
00:40:05.152,00:40:08.071,I’ve got it! We can simply roll it down a steep hill.
00:40:08.155,00:40:10.448,No. We’ll never find a smooth-enough surface.
00:40:10.532,00:40:13.451,Unless– Of course! Ice.
00:40:13.535,00:40:15.703,"We’ll wait until winter, when the lake freezes over."
00:40:15.787,00:40:18.998,"Winter? Doc, what are you talkin’ about? Monday, it’s three days away!"
00:40:19.082,00:40:23.461,All right. All right. Let’s think this thing through logically.
00:40:23.545,00:40:27.340,We know it won’t run under its own power. We know we can’t pull it.
00:40:27.424,00:40:30.760,But if we can figure out a way...
00:40:30.844,00:40:36.808,to push it up to 88 miles an hour– Huh?
00:40:41.355,00:40:44.941,That’s it!
00:40:45.025,00:40:46.943,How fast can she go?
00:40:47.027,00:40:49.862,"Why, I’ve had her up to 55, myself."
00:40:49.946,00:40:55.285,I heard Fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70 out past Verde Junction.
00:40:55.369,00:40:58.079,You think it’s possible to get it up to 90?
00:40:58.163,00:41:01.874,"Ha! Ninety? Tarnation, son, who’d ever need to be in such a hurry?"
00:41:01.958,00:41:04.627,"Just a little bet he and I have, that’s all."
00:41:04.711,00:41:07.171,"Theoretically speaking, could it be done?"
00:41:07.255,00:41:11.050,"Well, I suppose, if you had a straight stretch of track with a level grade..."
00:41:11.134,00:41:22.061,"and you weren’t haulin’ no cars behind you, and if you could get the fire hot enough– And I’m talkin’ about hotter than the blazes of hell and damnation itself– Then, yes, it might be possible to get her up that fast."
00:41:22.145,00:41:25.481,When’s the next train come through here?
00:41:25.565,00:41:29.652,Here! This spur runs off the main line three miles out to Clayton Ravine.
00:41:29.736,00:41:33.656,It’s a long stretch of level track that will still exist in 1985!
00:41:33.740,00:41:37.201,This is where we’ll push the DeLorean with a locomotive.
00:41:37.285,00:41:40.830,Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine Shonash Ravine.
00:41:40.914,00:41:43.249,That must be the old Indian name for it.
00:41:43.333,00:41:47.086,It’s perfect! A nice long run that goes clear across the bridge over the ravine.
00:41:47.170,00:41:49.672,"You know, over near that Hilldale housing development?"
00:41:49.756,00:41:54.218,"Right, Doc. But according to this map, there is no bridge."
00:41:54.302,00:41:58.181,"Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea."
00:41:58.265,00:42:00.850,We can’t wait a year and a half for this to get finished.
00:42:00.934,00:42:04.479,"Marty, it’s perfect! You’re just not thinking fourth-dimensionally."
00:42:04.563,00:42:07.482,"Right, right. I have a real problem with that."
00:42:07.566,00:42:11.986,The bridge will exist in 1985. It’s safe and still in use.
00:42:12.070,00:42:14.947,"Therefore, as long as we get the DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour..."
00:42:15.031,00:42:21.579,"before we hit the edge of the ravine, we’ll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed."
00:42:21.663,00:42:26.959,We’ll have track under us and coast safely across the ravine.
00:42:27.043,00:42:30.421,What about the locomotive?
00:42:34.301,00:42:37.220,- Help me! Help! - Great Scott!
00:42:38.972,00:42:41.140,Hyah!
00:42:41.224,00:42:42.726,Hey!
00:42:45.812,00:42:48.648,Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
00:43:17.177,00:43:18.637,Here! Here!
00:43:19.846,00:43:21.264,Hurry!
00:43:34.611,00:43:37.280,- Whoa! - Whoa!
00:43:40.534,00:43:42.202,You saved my...
00:43:44.538,00:43:46.623,life.
00:43:49.751,00:43:57.259,"Emmett Brown, at your service, Miss– Um– Um– Clayton."
00:43:58.552,00:43:59.886,Clara Clayton.
00:44:01.137,00:44:02.222,Clara.
00:44:05.892,00:44:07.727,What a beautiful name.
00:44:25.078,00:44:27.705,May I help you inside with these?
00:44:27.789,00:44:29.665,"Oh, no. That won’t be necessary."
00:44:29.749,00:44:33.169,I can take care of it. You’ve done more than enough already.
00:44:33.253,00:44:35.171,But it’s really no trouble.
00:44:35.255,00:44:37.548,She says it’s fine. We gotta get goin’.
00:44:37.632,00:44:41.135,"Ma’am, good luck with your schoolteachin’ and everything."
00:44:41.219,00:44:46.057,"Clara, I’ll straighten everything out with Mr. Statler for the buckboard rental."
00:44:46.141,00:44:47.767,Don’t you worry about that.
00:44:47.851,00:44:49.895,I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.
00:44:51.521,00:44:56.776,"Well, that would be very gentlemanly of you, Mr. Brown– Uh, Emmett."
00:44:58.486,00:45:02.448,"You know, I’m almost glad that snake spooked those horses."
00:45:02.532,00:45:05.368,"Otherwise, we might never have met."
00:45:05.452,00:45:07.078,Suppose it was destiny.
00:45:10.624,00:45:12.750,"Well, thank you for everything."
00:45:12.834,00:45:14.878,You’re quite welcome.
00:45:17.339,00:45:19.841,"I will see you again, won’t I?"
00:45:19.925,00:45:22.927,"Of course. You’ll see lots of me, I’m sure. I have a shop in town."
00:45:23.011,00:45:25.888,I’m the local scientist– uh-uh– b-blacksmith.
00:45:25.972,00:45:27.557,Science?
00:45:27.641,00:45:31.102,What sort of science? Astronomy? Chemistry?
00:45:31.186,00:45:33.980,"Actually, I’m a student of all sciences."
00:45:34.064,00:45:36.148,"Hey, Doc."
00:45:36.232,00:45:38.317,We gotta get goin’.
00:45:36.232,00:45:42.197,"Oh, yes. Well– Excuse us, Clara. We have to get going."
00:45:46.785,00:45:49.162,Tootle-oo!
00:45:55.961,00:45:58.170,You’re going to be seeing lots of her?
00:45:58.254,00:46:01.424,"Well, I might see her again, just in passing."
00:46:01.508,00:46:03.551,Did you see the way she was looking at you?
00:46:08.640,00:46:12.393,"After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine."
00:46:12.477,00:46:15.479,Clayton Ravine?
00:46:15.563,00:46:18.524,Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher.
00:46:18.608,00:46:20.818,They say she fell in there a hundred years ago.
00:46:20.902,00:46:23.446,A hundred years ago? That’s this year!
00:46:23.530,00:46:25.448,Every kid in school knows that story...
00:46:25.532,00:46:28.451,’cause we all have teachers we’d like to see fall into the ravine.
00:46:28.535,00:46:30.703,Great Scott!
00:46:30.787,00:46:34.957,Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon.
00:46:35.041,00:46:38.044,And now I may have seriously altered history.
00:46:39.295,00:46:42.381,"Look, Doc, what’s the worst that can happen, huh?"
00:46:42.465,00:46:44.800,So they don’t name the ravine after her.
00:46:44.884,00:46:47.219,Let’s just get the DeLorean ready and get out of here.
00:46:47.303,00:46:51.891,I wish I’d never invented that infernal time machine.
00:46:51.975,00:46:55.020,It’s caused nothing but disaster.
00:46:58.398,00:47:00.775,Doc. Doc. This is Marty. Do you read me? Over.
00:47:00.859,00:47:04.403,"Check, Marty."
00:47:04.487,00:47:09.325,"All right, Marty. Once more, let’s go over the entire plan and layout."
00:47:09.409,00:47:11.202,I apologize for the crudity of this model.
00:47:11.286,00:47:13.496,"Yeah, I know, Doc. It’s not to scale."
00:47:13.580,00:47:15.581,"It’s okay, Doc."
00:47:15.665,00:47:23.339,"Tomorrow night– Sunday– we’ll load the DeLorean onto the tracks here on the spur, right by the old abandoned silver mine."
00:47:23.423,00:47:26.342,The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line...
00:47:26.426,00:47:30.012,three miles out to Clayton– Shonash Ravine.
00:47:30.096,00:47:32.765,The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning.
00:47:32.849,00:47:41.190,"We’ll stop it here, uncouple the cars from the tender, throw the switch track and then we’ll hijack– borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine."
00:47:41.274,00:47:44.402,"According to my calculations, we’ll reach 88 miles per hour..."
00:47:44.486,00:47:46.570,just before we hit the edge of the ravine.
00:47:46.654,00:47:50.199,"At which point, we’ll be instantaneously transported back to 1985..."
00:47:50.283,00:47:52.910,and coast safely across the completed bridge.
00:47:52.994,00:47:56.288,What does this mean? Point of no return?
00:47:56.372,00:47:57.915,That’s our fail-safe point.
00:47:57.999,00:48:00.042,"Until there, we still have time to stop the locomotive..."
00:48:00.126,00:48:02.044,before it plunges into the ravine.
00:48:02.128,00:48:04.422,"But once we pass this windmill, it’s the future or bust."
00:48:07.425,00:48:10.136,"Here you go, Marty. Connect that to the positive terminal."
00:48:12.138,00:48:14.557,All right. You all set?
00:48:14.641,00:48:17.643,Train pullin’ out of the station!
00:48:17.727,00:48:19.854,Coming up to the switch track!
00:48:19.938,00:48:22.398,Stop at the switch track!
00:48:22.482,00:48:24.859,Throw switch!
00:48:24.943,00:48:27.403,Pull up to the DeLorean!
00:48:27.487,00:48:31.657,Pushing the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour!
00:48:37.997,00:48:40.916,It couldn’t be simpler.
00:48:46.422,00:48:48.299,Emmett?
00:48:48.383,00:48:50.134,It’s Clara!
00:48:50.218,00:48:52.345,Quick! Cover the DeLorean!
00:48:59.686,00:49:01.896,Hello.
00:49:01.980,00:49:03.898,This is quite a surprise.
00:49:05.525,00:49:07.860,"Well, I hope I’m not disturbing anything."
00:49:07.944,00:49:11.697,"Oh, no, no. We were just doing a little model railroading."
00:49:11.781,00:49:13.366,Oh.
00:49:14.576,00:49:26.504,"Emmett, when my bags were thrown from the wagon, my telescope was damaged, and since you mentioned an interest in science, I thought you might be able to repair it for me."
00:49:26.588,00:49:30.299,"I-I would pay you, of course."
00:49:30.383,00:49:34.804,I wouldn’t think of charging you for this. Let’s have a look at it.
00:49:34.888,00:49:37.473,I think a lens may be out of alignment...
00:49:37.557,00:49:43.145,"because if you– if you move it this way, the image turns fuzzy."
00:49:43.229,00:49:44.647,See?
00:49:44.731,00:49:46.232,But if you turn it...
00:49:47.233,00:49:52.530,"the other way, then– Everything becomes..."
00:49:55.241,00:49:56.784,clear.
00:50:01.706,00:50:04.667,I could repair it right away and have it for you tonight.
00:50:04.751,00:50:07.169,"Oh, tonight’s the town festival."
00:50:07.253,00:50:09.797,I wouldn’t dream of having you work on my telescope...
00:50:09.881,00:50:11.674,during such an important occasion.
00:50:11.758,00:50:15.678,"You-You are planning on attending, aren’t you?"
00:50:15.762,00:50:19.891,"Oh– Well, actually, ma’am– Yes, yes. Of course. The festival."
00:50:20.767,00:50:26.188,"Well, in that case, I’ll see you this evening at the festival, Emmett."
00:50:26.272,00:50:28.274,Mr. Eastwood.
00:50:31.361,00:50:34.029,Thank you for taking care of my telescope.
00:50:34.113,00:50:36.032,You’re quite welcome.
00:50:41.704,00:50:43.247,It’s a nice telescope.
00:50:43.331,00:50:53.716,"Ladies and gentlemen, as mayor of Hill Valley, it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this clock to the people of Hill County."
00:50:55.301,00:50:58.429,May it stand for all time!
00:50:58.513,00:51:00.931,"Tell me when, gentlemen."
00:51:01.015,00:51:07.521,"Three, two, one– Now!"
00:51:12.402,00:51:15.321,Let the festivities begin!
00:51:22.662,00:51:26.123,"In a way, it’s fitting that you and I are here to witness this."
00:51:26.207,00:51:28.918,It’s too bad I didn’t bring my camera.
00:51:35.341,00:51:36.801,"Ready, gentlemen?"
00:51:38.303,00:51:41.472,"The only problem is, we’ll never be able to show it to anybody."
00:51:41.556,00:51:42.932,"Smile, Doc."
00:52:07.665,00:52:09.959,What great music.
00:52:10.043,00:52:12.711,"Yeah. It’s got a beat, and you can dance to it."
00:52:12.795,00:52:15.923,"Step right up, gentlemen, and test your mettle with the latest products..."
00:52:16.007,00:52:18.467,from Colonel Samuel Colt’s Patent Firearms...
00:52:18.551,00:52:21.679,"Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut."
00:52:21.763,00:52:24.682,"Now, take this model, for example."
00:52:24.766,00:52:31.981,"The new, improved and refined Colt Peacemaker, selling to you tonight for the low, low price..."
00:52:32.065,00:52:33.983,of $12.
00:52:49.791,00:52:51.584,Good evening.
00:52:53.086,00:52:55.504,You look very nice.
00:52:55.588,00:52:57.173,Thank you.
00:53:05.723,00:53:12.438,"Would you like– Uh– Would you care to-to, uh– I’d love to."
00:53:30.039,00:53:32.541,"Young man, how ’bout you? You want to give it a try?"
00:53:32.625,00:53:46.221,"Uh, no, no. No, thanks. Hey, Doc– Son? Sonny boy?"
00:53:46.305,00:53:48.057,The doc can dance?
00:53:50.435,00:53:53.228,Son? Son.
00:53:53.312,00:53:55.564,Son! H-Hey.
00:53:55.648,00:53:58.984,I just told you that even a baby can handle this weapon.
00:53:59.068,00:54:02.154,Surely you’re not afraid to try something that a baby could do.
00:54:02.238,00:54:04.323,"Hey, I’m not afraid of nothin’."
00:54:04.407,00:54:06.450,Let’s just step up here like a man.
00:54:06.534,00:54:09.203,"Now then, what you do is you just..."
00:54:09.287,00:54:12.873,ease that hammer back there and squeeze off a round.
00:54:12.957,00:54:14.458,"No, no, no, no."
00:54:14.542,00:54:17.419,Right on out there and be real smooth.
00:54:17.503,00:54:19.630,That’s the way you do it.
00:54:22.925,00:54:26.846,Listen. Can I try that again?
00:54:38.316,00:54:42.736,Just tell me one thing. Where’d you learn to shoot like that?
00:54:42.820,00:54:45.155,7-Eleven.
00:54:49.035,00:54:52.287,"Buford, you sure that blacksmith’s gonna be at this here shindig?"
00:54:52.371,00:54:55.374,"Sure, he’s here. Everybody’s here tonight."
00:54:57.627,00:54:59.628,You gentlemen will have to check your firearms...
00:54:59.712,00:55:02.131,if you want to join in on the festivities.
00:55:08.930,00:55:12.141,Marshal Strickland. I didn’t know you was back in town.
00:55:12.225,00:55:16.186,"If you can’t read the sign, Tannen, I presume you can read this."
00:55:16.270,00:55:19.356,Pretty tough hombre when you’re pointing a scatter gun at a man’s back.
00:55:19.440,00:55:24.237,"Just like you, Tannen, I take every advantage I can get. Now, you gonna check your iron?"
00:55:25.988,00:55:28.407,I was just joking with your deputy.
00:55:28.491,00:55:30.325,Of course I’m gonna check my iron.
00:55:30.409,00:55:33.162,"We all were. Weren’t we, boys?"
00:55:37.416,00:55:39.085,Your knife too.
00:55:45.925,00:55:49.344,"Smile, Marshal. After all, this is a party."
00:55:49.428,00:55:54.684,Only party I’ll be smilin’ at is the one that sees you at the end of a rope.
00:55:57.311,00:55:59.272,Have fun!
00:56:02.608,00:56:04.526,"That’s how you handle them, Son."
00:56:04.610,00:56:07.529,"Never give ’em an inch, and maintain discipline at all times."
00:56:07.613,00:56:10.741,Remember that word– discipline.
00:56:10.825,00:56:12.743,"I will, Pa."
00:56:17.790,00:56:19.291,Thank you very much.
00:56:19.375,00:56:23.462,"Why, Mr. Eastwood. Nice to see you."
00:56:23.546,00:56:27.883,"I see you got yourself some respectable clothes, lad, and a fine hat."
00:56:27.967,00:56:31.428,"Yeah, well, a couple of people didn’t like the way the other one looked on me."
00:56:31.512,00:56:34.724,Sure’n that one suits you. It’s very becomin’.
00:56:36.350,00:56:39.270,Hey. Frisbee. Far out.
00:56:41.689,00:56:45.067,What was the meanin’ of that?
00:56:59.707,00:57:02.751,"Hey, that’s mine! Gimme that."
00:57:02.835,00:57:04.378,"There he is, Buford!"
00:57:05.671,00:57:07.130,Where?
00:57:07.214,00:57:09.758,Dancin’ with that piece of calico.
00:57:09.842,00:57:11.344,"What are you gonna do, boss?"
00:57:14.096,00:57:19.184,"I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enough in his back, nobody’ll hear the shot."
00:57:19.268,00:57:21.728,"Careful, Buford. You ain’t got but one bullet with that."
00:57:21.812,00:57:23.855,I only need one.
00:57:35.242,00:57:37.202,"I told you to watch your back, Smithy."
00:57:37.286,00:57:39.454,Tannen. But you’re early.
00:57:39.538,00:57:41.957,"It’s a Derringer, Smithy. Small but effective."
00:57:42.041,00:57:44.626,"Last time I used it, fella took two whole days to die."
00:57:47.713,00:57:51.300,That means you’ll be dead by about suppertime Monday.
00:57:51.384,00:57:54.177,"Excuse me. I don’t know who you think you are, but we’re dancing."
00:57:54.261,00:57:57.014,"Well, looky what we have here."
00:57:57.098,00:57:59.558,Ain’t you going to introduce me? I’d like a dance.
00:57:59.642,00:58:03.478,I wouldn’t give you the pleasure. You’ll just have to go ahead and shoot.
00:58:03.562,00:58:05.814,All right.
00:58:05.898,00:58:07.816,"Boys, keep the blacksmith company..."
00:58:07.900,00:58:10.110,while I get acquainted with the filly!
00:58:10.194,00:58:12.154,Yeow! Ha-ha!
00:58:15.991,00:58:19.202,I don’t dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand.
00:58:19.286,00:58:22.039,"Oh, you’ll learn. You’ll learn."
00:58:22.123,00:58:25.042,"You know, Smithy, maybe I’ll just take my $80 worth out of her!"
00:58:25.126,00:58:26.919,"Tannen, leave her alone!"
00:58:30.172,00:58:33.884,Yeah. I bet there’s somethin’ you can do that’s worth $80.
00:58:35.094,00:58:37.679,"I believe you’ve underestimated me, mister."
00:58:37.763,00:58:39.223,"Oh, have I, now?"
00:58:47.857,00:58:50.651,"Damn you, Tannen!"
00:59:02.788,00:59:03.872,You.
00:59:03.956,00:59:05.541,"Hey, lighten up, jerk!"
00:59:09.628,00:59:11.588,"Mighty strong words, runt."
00:59:11.672,00:59:14.800,You man enough to back ’em up with more than just a pie plate?
00:59:18.012,00:59:20.263,"Look, just leave my friends alone."
00:59:20.347,00:59:23.142,"Oh, what’s wrong, dude? You yellow?"
00:59:30.733,00:59:33.068,That’s what I thought.
00:59:33.152,00:59:34.779,A yellowbelly.
00:59:40.284,00:59:43.245,Nobody calls me yellow.
00:59:45.581,00:59:47.082,right now.
00:59:47.166,00:59:49.918,"Uh, not now, Buford. Marshal’s got our guns."
00:59:50.002,00:59:52.087,"Like I said, we’ll finish this tomorrow."
00:59:52.171,00:59:54.756,Tomorrow we’re robbing the Pine City stage.
00:59:54.840,00:59:57.426,What about Monday? We doin’ anything Monday?
00:59:57.510,01:00:00.178,"Uh, no. Monday’d be fine. You can kill him on Monday."
01:00:00.262,01:00:02.431,I’ll be back this way on Monday.
01:00:02.515,01:00:04.182,We’ll settle this then...
01:00:04.266,01:00:06.852,right there out in the street...
01:00:06.936,01:00:09.896,in front of the Palace Saloon.
01:00:09.980,01:00:12.023,"Yeah, right. When?"
01:00:12.107,01:00:14.109,High noon?
01:00:14.193,01:00:16.695,I do my killin’ before breakfast.
01:00:16.779,01:00:18.364,7:00.
01:00:20.741,01:00:23.118,8:00.
01:00:23.202,01:00:25.454,I do my killing after breakfast.
01:00:31.377,01:00:33.795,"All right, now break it up. What’s all this about?"
01:00:33.879,01:00:36.631,"You causin’ trouble here, Tannen?"
01:00:36.715,01:00:38.508,"No trouble, Marshal."
01:00:38.592,01:00:41.845,Just a little personal matter between me and Eastwood.
01:00:41.929,01:00:45.640,This don’t concern the law.
01:00:45.724,01:00:47.225,Now break it up.
01:00:47.309,01:00:50.270,"Any brawlin’, it’s 15 days in the county jail."
01:00:50.354,01:00:54.816,"All right, folks, come on. This is a party! Come on! Let’s have some fun!"
01:00:59.488,01:01:02.032,"8:00 Monday, runt."
01:01:02.116,01:01:07.579,"If you ain’t here, I’ll hunt you and shoot you down like a duck."
01:01:07.663,01:01:10.999,"That’s dog, Buford. Shoot him down like a dog."
01:01:11.083,01:01:13.335,"Let’s go, boys!"
01:01:13.419,01:01:15.588,Let these sissies have their party!
01:01:16.964,01:01:19.424,"Marty, what are you doing, saying you’re gonna meet Tannen?"
01:01:19.508,01:01:21.343,"Hey, Doc, Doc, don’t worry about it."
01:01:21.427,01:01:23.929,"Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. We’re gonna be gone, right?"
01:01:24.013,01:01:27.015,"Theoretically, yes. But what if the train’s late?"
01:01:27.099,01:01:28.558,Late?
01:01:28.642,01:01:31.394,"No, we’ll discuss it now."
01:01:31.478,01:01:34.689,"No. Hey, ma’am."
01:01:34.773,01:01:37.734,"Marty– Uh, Clint, I’m gonna take Clara home."
01:01:37.818,01:01:40.445,"Good night, Doc, Clara."
01:01:40.529,01:01:43.532,Glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son of a bitch.
01:01:43.616,01:01:46.618,"You’re all right in my book, Mr. Eastwood. I’d like to buy you a drink."
01:01:46.702,01:01:50.163,"Listen, I don’t want a drink. Don’t have to buy me anything. It was no big deal."
01:01:50.247,01:01:53.250,I’d like you to have this brand-new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt.
01:01:53.334,01:01:55.585,Free of charge.
01:01:55.669,01:01:57.170,Free?
01:01:57.254,01:02:00.423,I want everybody to know that the gun that shot Buford Tannen...
01:02:00.507,01:02:02.467,was a Colt Peacemaker.
01:02:02.551,01:02:05.011,"H-Hey, no problem. Thanks a lot."
01:02:05.095,01:02:09.350,"Of course you understand that if you lose, I’m takin’ it back."
01:02:12.436,01:02:13.938,Thanks again.
01:02:17.232,01:02:18.942,"You had him, Mr. Eastwood."
01:02:19.026,01:02:21.903,"You could’ve just walked away, and nobody would’ve thought less of you for it."
01:02:21.987,01:02:26.491,"All it would’ve been was words, hot air from a buffoon."
01:02:26.575,01:02:32.581,"Instead you let him rile you, rile you into playing his game, his way, by his rules."
01:02:32.665,01:02:34.958,"Seamus, relax. I know what I’m doin’."
01:02:35.042,01:02:36.960,He reminds me of poor Martin.
01:02:37.044,01:02:38.545,Who?
01:02:38.629,01:02:41.631,Wait a minute. You have a brother named Martin McFly?
01:02:41.715,01:02:44.050,Had a brother.
01:02:44.134,01:02:46.845,Martin used to let men provoke him into fightin’.
01:02:46.929,01:02:49.848,He was concerned that people would think him a coward if he refused.
01:02:49.932,01:02:52.267,That’s how he got a bowie knife shoved through his belly...
01:02:52.351,01:02:55.270,in a saloon in Virginia City.
01:02:55.354,01:02:58.941,"Never considered the future, poor Martin, God rest his soul."
01:03:00.734,01:03:04.154,"Sure’n I hope you’re considerin’ the future, Mr. Eastwood."
01:03:07.825,01:03:10.327,I think about it all the time.
01:03:12.997,01:03:15.540,the one that’s out there all by itself like a star burst?
01:03:15.624,01:03:18.793,That one’s called Copernicus.
01:03:20.462,01:03:22.380,I feel like I’m teaching school.
01:03:22.464,01:03:25.467,"No, no, no, please, continue the lesson."
01:03:25.551,01:03:28.637,I never found lunar geography so fascinating.
01:03:28.721,01:03:30.722,You’re quite knowledgeable.
01:03:30.806,01:03:32.599,"When I was 11, I had diphtheria."
01:03:32.683,01:03:34.643,I was quarantined for three months.
01:03:34.727,01:03:38.313,So my father brought this telescope and put it next to my bed...
01:03:38.397,01:03:41.191,so I could see everything out the window.
01:03:42.901,01:03:45.403,we’ll ever be able to travel to the moon...
01:03:45.487,01:03:48.657,the way we travel across the country on trains?
01:03:48.741,01:03:51.993,"Definitely, although not for another 84 years, and not on trains."
01:03:52.077,01:04:02.796,"We’ll have space vehicles– capsules sent aloft with rockets, devices that create giant explosions, explosions so powerful that they– That they break the pull of the Earth’s gravity..."
01:04:02.880,01:04:06.050,and send the projectile through outer space.
01:04:07.342,01:04:09.844,Emmett! I read that book too.
01:04:09.928,01:04:13.348,"You’re quoting Jules Verne, From the Earth to the Moon."
01:04:13.432,01:04:15.850,You’ve read Jules Verne?
01:04:15.934,01:04:18.436,I adore Jules Verne.
01:04:18.520,01:04:20.105,So do I.
01:04:20.189,01:04:23.024,Twenty-Thousand Leagues Under the Sea– my absolute favorite.
01:04:23.108,01:04:27.612,"The first time I read that when I was a little boy, I wanted to meet Captain Nemo!"
01:04:27.696,01:04:31.032,"Don’t tease, Emmett. You couldn’t have read that when you were a little boy."
01:04:31.116,01:04:33.576,It was only first published 10 years ago.
01:04:33.660,01:04:36.287,"O-Oh, yes, well, I meant..."
01:04:36.371,01:04:38.624,it made me feel like a boy.
01:04:39.958,01:04:42.335,I never met a woman...
01:04:42.419,01:04:44.713,who liked Jules Verne before.
01:04:46.632,01:04:50.094,"I never, ever met a man like you before."
01:05:42.396,01:05:43.897,Doc?
01:05:48.193,01:05:49.695,Doc?
01:05:52.447,01:05:54.533,Hope you know what you’re doin’.
01:06:07.921,01:06:09.756,You talkin’ to me?
01:06:12.467,01:06:14.720,"You talkin’ to me, Tannen?"
01:06:18.640,01:06:21.518,"Well, I’m the only one here."
01:06:21.602,01:06:25.063,Go ahead. Make my day.
01:06:31.528,01:06:34.364,"Say, good morning, Mr. Eastwood."
01:06:34.448,01:06:36.157,"Have a cigar, Mr. Eastwood."
01:06:36.241,01:06:38.618,"Anything I can do for you today, Mr. Eastwood?"
01:06:38.702,01:06:43.832,"No, that’s fine. I– Good luck tomorrow, Mr. Eastwood! We’ll be prayin’ for ya!"
01:06:43.916,01:06:46.000,Thanks.
01:06:46.084,01:06:48.086,"Good morning, Mr. Eastwood."
01:06:48.170,01:06:51.131,Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?
01:06:51.215,01:06:54.843,"Uh, I’m-I’m fine. Thanks."
01:07:06.939,01:07:08.940,What are you doin’?
01:07:09.024,01:07:11.401,I’m just out enjoying the morning air.
01:07:11.485,01:07:14.070,It’s really lovely here in the morning. Don’t you think?
01:07:14.154,01:07:20.786,"Yeah, it’s lovely, Doc. We gotta load the DeLorean up and get ready to roll– Hey, look at that. The tombstone."
01:07:22.537,01:07:24.790,"Marty, let me see that photograph again."
01:07:29.628,01:07:32.213,"Hey, that’s great, Doc! Don’t you get it?"
01:07:32.297,01:07:35.049,"We’re going back to the future tomorrow, so everything’s being erased."
01:07:35.133,01:07:36.801,But only my name is erased!
01:07:36.885,01:07:40.763,The tombstone itself and the dates still remain. That doesn’t make sense.
01:07:40.847,01:07:43.266,We know that this photograph represents what will happen...
01:07:43.350,01:07:46.728,if the events of today continue to run their course into tomorrow.
01:07:46.812,01:07:49.105,"Right. So– Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood."
01:07:49.189,01:07:50.773,I just need to take your measurement.
01:07:50.857,01:07:53.109,"Oh, look, pal, I don’t want to buy a suit."
01:07:56.363,01:07:59.741,My coffin?
01:07:59.825,01:08:01.993,Might as well be prepared.
01:08:02.077,01:08:05.747,"So, it may not be my name that’s supposed to end up on this tombstone."
01:08:05.831,01:08:08.583,It may be yours.
01:08:08.667,01:08:11.002,Great Scott!
01:08:11.086,01:08:13.004,"Marty, why are you wearing that gun?"
01:08:13.088,01:08:15.173,You’re not considering going up against Tannen tomorrow?
01:08:15.257,01:08:21.429,"Doc, tomorrow morning I’m going back to the future with you, but if Buford Tannen comes lookin’ for trouble, I’m gonna be ready for him."
01:08:21.513,01:08:23.932,You heard what that son of a bitch called me last night.
01:08:24.016,01:08:26.643,You can’t go losing your judgment every time someone calls you a name.
01:08:26.727,01:08:29.980,That’s exactly what causes you to get into that accident in the future.
01:08:32.566,01:08:34.275,What?
01:08:34.359,01:08:36.444,What about my future?
01:08:36.528,01:08:39.656,I can’t tell you. It might make things worse.
01:08:39.740,01:08:43.534,"Wait a minute, Doc. What is wrong with my future?"
01:08:43.618,01:08:46.537,"Marty, we all have to make decisions..."
01:08:46.621,01:08:49.123,that affect the course of our lives.
01:08:49.207,01:08:54.129,"You’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do, and I’ve gotta do what I’ve gotta do."
01:09:05.682,01:09:07.517,Marty.
01:09:07.601,01:09:09.477,I’ve made a decision.
01:09:09.561,01:09:11.729,I’m not going with you tomorrow.
01:09:11.813,01:09:13.815,I’m staying here.
01:09:16.902,01:09:19.570,"What are you talking about, Doc?"
01:09:19.654,01:09:22.824,There’s no point in denying it. I’m in love with Clara.
01:09:22.908,01:09:26.661,"Oh, man. Doc, we don’t belong here."
01:09:26.745,01:09:28.496,Neither one of us.
01:09:28.580,01:09:31.332,"You know, it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow."
01:09:31.416,01:09:34.127,This tombstone could still be in your future.
01:09:34.211,01:09:37.338,"Marty, the future isn’t written."
01:09:37.422,01:09:39.966,It can be changed. You know that.
01:09:41.259,01:09:45.096,Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be.
01:09:45.180,01:09:49.475,I can’t let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny.
01:09:49.559,01:09:53.354,I have to lead my life according to what I believe is right...
01:09:53.438,01:09:55.690,in my heart.
01:09:58.860,01:10:00.862,You’re a scientist.
01:10:01.905,01:10:06.952,"So you tell me– What’s the right thing to do, up here?"
01:10:20.382,01:10:22.467,"You’re right, Marty."
01:10:44.072,01:10:45.782,Wow. That worked great.
01:10:45.866,01:10:48.368,I’ve at least got to tell her good-bye.
01:10:49.619,01:10:52.080,"Oh, come on, Doc."
01:10:52.164,01:10:54.207,Think about it. What are you gonna say to her?
01:10:54.291,01:10:55.750,I gotta go back to the future?
01:10:55.834,01:10:58.002,"I mean, she’s not gonna understand that, Doc."
01:10:58.086,01:11:01.089,"Hell, I’m in it with you, and I don’t even understand it."
01:11:04.176,01:11:06.636,Doc. Listen.
01:11:08.472,01:11:12.684,Maybe we could– I don’t know. Maybe we could just take Clara with us.
01:11:14.686,01:11:16.688,To the future?
01:11:20.400,01:11:22.402,"You reminded me, Marty."
01:11:22.486,01:11:25.863,"I’m a scientist, so I must be scientific about this."
01:11:25.947,01:11:29.117,I cautioned you about disrupting the continuum for your own personal benefit.
01:11:29.201,01:11:31.494,"Therefore, I must do no less."
01:11:31.578,01:11:38.292,"We shall proceed as planned, and as soon as we return to 1985, we’ll destroy this infernal machine."
01:11:38.376,01:11:41.379,Traveling through time has become much too painful.
01:12:11.910,01:12:13.912,"It’s Emmett, Clara."
01:12:16.873,01:12:23.254,"Oh! Emmett, I– Won’t you come in?"
01:12:26.258,01:12:27.759,What’s wrong?
01:12:29.135,01:12:30.845,I’ve come to say good-bye.
01:12:32.514,01:12:35.057,"Good-bye? Well, where are you going?"
01:12:35.141,01:12:40.438,"I’m going away, and, well, I’m afraid I’ll never see you again."
01:12:41.815,01:12:43.357,Emmett.
01:12:43.441,01:12:44.943,Clara.
01:12:46.111,01:12:54.911,"I want you to know that I care about you deeply, but I realize that I don’t belong here, and I have to go back where I came from."
01:12:54.995,01:12:57.622,And where might that be?
01:12:57.706,01:12:59.708,I can’t tell you.
01:13:01.668,01:13:05.589,"Well, then wherever you’re going, take me with you."
01:13:06.798,01:13:09.050,"I can’t, Clara."
01:13:09.134,01:13:13.971,"I wish it didn’t have to be this way, but just believe me when I tell you that I’ll never forget you..."
01:13:14.055,01:13:17.267,and that I love you.
01:13:18.643,01:13:21.145,I don’t understand what you’re trying to say.
01:13:21.229,01:13:25.149,"Clara, I don’t think there’s any way that you can understand it."
01:13:25.233,01:13:28.110,"Please, Emmett, please. I have to know."
01:13:28.194,01:13:31.406,"If you sincerely do love me, then tell me the truth."
01:13:33.241,01:13:35.743,All right then.
01:13:35.827,01:13:39.121,I’m from the future.
01:13:39.205,01:13:46.838,"I came here in a time machine that I invented, and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985."
01:13:52.677,01:13:54.179,"Yes, Emmett."
01:13:55.513,01:13:57.182,I do understand.
01:13:59.684,01:14:08.193,"I understand that, because you know I’m partial to the writings of Jules Verne, you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me!"
01:14:09.235,01:14:14.448,"Oh, I’ve heard some whoppers in my day, but the fact that you’d expect me to entertain a notion like that..."
01:14:14.532,01:14:17.369,is so insulting and degrading!
01:14:18.662,01:14:20.705,"All you had to say is, I don’t love you..."
01:14:20.789,01:14:22.832,and I don’t want to see you anymore.
01:14:22.916,01:14:25.334,That at least would’ve been respectful!
01:14:25.418,01:14:27.753,But that’s not the truth.
01:15:10.338,01:15:13.716,"Emmett. What can I get you, the usual?"
01:15:13.800,01:15:17.511,"No, Chester, I’m gonna need something a lot stronger than that tonight."
01:15:17.595,01:15:19.221,Sarsaparilla.
01:15:19.305,01:15:21.349,"Whiskey, Chester."
01:15:21.433,01:15:24.018,"Whiskey? Emmett, are you sure?"
01:15:24.102,01:15:26.520,You know what happened to you on the Fourth of July.
01:15:26.604,01:15:28.106,Whiskey.
01:15:29.107,01:15:32.234,Okay. I ain’t your papa.
01:15:32.318,01:15:35.655,I just don’t wanna see you do the wrong thing.
01:15:36.781,01:15:38.783,And you can leave the bottle.
01:15:40.785,01:15:43.954,It’s a woman. Right?
01:15:44.038,01:15:46.540,I knew it. I have seen that look on a man’s face...
01:15:46.624,01:15:49.043,a thousand times all across the country.
01:15:49.127,01:15:51.921,"All I can tell you, friend, is you’ll get over her."
01:15:52.005,01:15:56.342,Nope. Clara was one in a million.
01:15:56.426,01:15:58.594,One in a billion.
01:15:58.678,01:16:00.721,One in a googolplex.
01:16:00.805,01:16:04.392,"The woman of my dreams, and I lost her for all time."
01:16:04.476,01:16:09.105,"Well, I can assure you, sir, there are other women."
01:16:09.189,01:16:11.857,If peddling this barbed wire all across the country...
01:16:11.941,01:16:16.570,"has taught me one thing for certain, it’s that you never know what the future might bring."
01:16:18.364,01:16:21.785,"Oh, I can tell you about the future."
01:16:27.749,01:16:29.542,Ow.
01:16:29.626,01:16:31.877,Ow.
01:16:31.961,01:16:34.213,"Oh, man, did I sleep."
01:16:36.883,01:16:38.885,"What time is it, Doc?"
01:16:40.553,01:16:42.596,"Oh, no."
01:16:42.680,01:16:44.182,Doc!
01:16:54.609,01:16:56.277,Wake up!
01:16:58.404,01:17:01.198,Get up! Let’s go!
01:17:01.282,01:17:03.325,I got me a runt to kill.
01:17:03.409,01:17:07.163,"It’s still early, boss. What’s your hurry?"
01:17:07.247,01:17:08.789,I’m hungry.
01:17:08.873,01:17:14.253,"And in the future, we don’t need horses."
01:17:14.337,01:17:17.798,We have motorized carriages called automobiles.
01:17:19.342,01:17:24.805,"If everybody’s got one of these auto-whatsits, does anybody walk or run anymore?"
01:17:24.889,01:17:29.351,"Of course we run, but for recreation, for fun."
01:17:29.435,01:17:33.147,Run for fun? What the hell kind of fun is that?
01:17:43.449,01:17:45.952,Doc! Doc!
01:17:52.417,01:17:54.210,How much has he had?
01:17:54.294,01:17:57.671,None. That’s the first one. He hasn’t touched it yet.
01:18:03.553,01:18:05.554,Doc! Doc!
01:18:05.638,01:18:07.556,What are you doin’?
01:18:07.640,01:18:10.768,"I’ve lost her, Marty. There’s nothing left for me here."
01:18:10.852,01:18:13.395,"All right, that’s why you gotta come back with me."
01:18:13.479,01:18:15.231,Back to the future!
01:18:19.319,01:18:22.488,Right. Let’s get going.
01:18:22.572,01:18:25.866,"Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train."
01:18:27.785,01:18:30.120,And to the future.
01:18:30.204,01:18:33.291,"- Amen! - Emmett, no!"
01:18:40.340,01:18:44.009,Doc! Doc! Doc!
01:18:44.093,01:18:48.055,"Come on, Doc, wake up. Wake up, Doc!"
01:18:48.139,01:18:50.474,- How many did he have? - Just the one.
01:18:50.558,01:18:52.643,"Just the one? Come on, Doc!"
01:18:52.727,01:18:55.020,There’s a fella that can’t hold his liquor.
01:18:55.104,01:18:57.898,"Get me some coffee, black."
01:19:00.360,01:19:02.612,Hyah!
01:19:07.992,01:19:09.785,Ma’am?
01:19:09.869,01:19:12.079,How far does the 8:00 train go?
01:19:12.163,01:19:14.499,San Francisco’s the end of the line.
01:19:16.042,01:19:19.420,I’ll take a one-way ticket.
01:19:19.504,01:19:23.924,"You want to sober him up in a hurry, son, you’re gonna have to use something stronger than coffee."
01:19:24.008,01:19:26.427,Yeah? What do you suggest?
01:19:26.511,01:19:29.972,Joey! Let’s make some wake-up juice.
01:19:30.056,01:19:32.766,"Come on, Doc, swallow. Here we go."
01:19:32.850,01:19:35.144,Snap out of it. Come on.
01:19:37.647,01:19:42.693,"In about 10 minutes, he’s gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday."
01:19:42.777,01:19:44.862,Ten minutes?
01:19:44.946,01:19:47.448,Why do we have to cut these things so damn close?
01:19:47.532,01:19:50.326,Here. Stick this clothespin on his nose.
01:19:52.036,01:19:57.416,"And when he opens up his mouth, go ahead and pour it on down his gullet."
01:19:57.500,01:19:59.669,"Oh, and stand back."
01:20:17.937,01:20:21.315,He’s still out!
01:20:21.399,01:20:24.985,It’s gonna take a few more minutes for the stuff to really clear up his head.
01:20:25.069,01:20:26.070,Perfect.
01:20:47.216,01:20:49.510,"Come on, Doc. Come on. Wake up, buddy."
01:20:49.594,01:20:52.304,"Wake up, Doc. Come on. Come on."
01:20:52.388,01:20:55.182,Seamus! Wouldn’t expect to see you here this morning.
01:20:55.266,01:21:03.273,"Aye, but somethin’ inside me told me I should be here, as if my future had somethin’ to do with it."
01:21:03.357,01:21:04.900,Come on.
01:21:04.984,01:21:06.694,He’ll come around in a minute.
01:21:06.778,01:21:08.570,Come on.
01:21:08.654,01:21:12.075,"Let’s go, Doc. Let’s wake up now, buddy. Come on."
01:21:18.539,01:21:20.541,"Are you in there, Eastwood?"
01:21:22.460,01:21:26.422,"It’s 8:00, and I’m callin’ you out!"
01:21:30.802,01:21:32.428,It’s not 8:00 yet!
01:21:32.512,01:21:34.888,It is by my watch!
01:21:34.972,01:21:37.558,"Let’s settle this once and for all, runt."
01:21:39.352,01:21:41.813,Or ain’t you got the gumption?
01:21:51.155,01:21:52.657,Listen.
01:21:54.826,01:22:01.081,"I’m not really feeling up to this today, so I’m gonna have to forfeit."
01:22:01.165,01:22:04.501,Forfeit. Forfeit?
01:22:04.585,01:22:06.670,What’s that mean?
01:22:06.754,01:22:09.673,"Um, it means that you win without a fight."
01:22:09.757,01:22:13.343,Without shootin’? He can’t do tha– You can’t do that!
01:22:13.427,01:22:15.471,You know what I think?
01:22:15.555,01:22:21.268,"I think you ain’t nothin’ but a gutless, yellow turd, and I’m givin’ you to the count of 10..."
01:22:21.352,01:22:24.313,to come out here and prove I’m wrong!
01:22:24.397,01:22:26.356,One!
01:22:26.440,01:22:29.443,"Come on. Sober up, buddy. Let’s go. Come on. Two!"
01:22:29.527,01:22:30.986,"You better get out there, son."
01:22:31.070,01:22:34.198,"I got $20 gold bet on you, so don’t let me down."
01:22:34.282,01:22:37.534,Three!
01:22:34.282,01:22:39.536,"I got $30 gold bet agin ya, so don’t let me down!"
01:22:39.620,01:22:48.170,"- Four! - You better face up to it, son, ’cause if you don’t go out there– What?"
01:22:48.254,01:22:49.963,What if I don’t go out there?
01:22:50.047,01:22:52.466,- You’re a coward. - Six!
01:22:52.550,01:22:55.469,And you’ll be branded a coward for the rest of your days.
01:22:55.553,01:22:59.807,Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood...
01:22:59.891,01:23:03.394,is the biggest yellowbelly in the West.
01:23:07.607,01:23:08.982,Seven!
01:23:09.066,01:23:10.693,Here!
01:23:15.072,01:23:16.532,Eight!
01:23:25.041,01:23:26.542,I already got a gun.
01:23:28.377,01:23:29.879,Nine!
01:23:34.300,01:23:35.718,Ten!
01:23:40.640,01:23:42.516,"Did you hear me, runt?"
01:23:42.600,01:23:46.771,"I said, that’s 10, you gutless, yellow pie slinger!"
01:23:50.399,01:23:52.109,He’s an asshole!
01:23:52.193,01:23:54.611,I don’t care what Tannen says!
01:23:54.695,01:23:57.698,And I don’t care what anybody else says either.
01:23:57.782,01:23:59.700,Doc!
01:23:59.784,01:24:02.536,"Doc, you okay?"
01:24:02.620,01:24:06.123,What a headache.
01:24:06.207,01:24:08.208,Yeah. It’s in the back.
01:24:08.292,01:24:11.796,"Are you comin’ out here, or do I have to come in there after you?"
01:24:13.673,01:24:15.716,The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.
01:24:15.800,01:24:17.635,Hey!
01:24:23.557,01:24:25.226,"Reach, blacksmith!"
01:24:42.159,01:24:44.745,"Yes, sir, that poor fella last night..."
01:24:44.829,01:24:48.874,had the worst case of broken heart I have ever seen.
01:24:48.958,01:24:52.002,When he said he didn’t know how he could live the rest of his life...
01:24:52.086,01:24:57.549,"knowing how much hurt he’d caused that little girl, well, I really felt for him."
01:24:57.633,01:24:59.135,I did. Right here.
01:25:05.433,01:25:09.102,"I aim to shoot somebody today, and I’d prefer it’d be you."
01:25:09.186,01:25:14.274,"But if you’re just too damn yellow, I guess it’ll just have to be your blacksmith friend."
01:25:14.358,01:25:16.819,"Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!"
01:25:21.699,01:25:23.784,You got one minute to decide.
01:25:23.868,01:25:26.036,"You hear me, runt? One minute!"
01:25:29.457,01:25:32.501,I’ve never seen a man so broken up over a woman.
01:25:32.585,01:25:35.295,What’d he say her name was? Cara? Sara?
01:25:35.379,01:25:37.631,Clara.
01:25:40.092,01:25:43.011,Excuse me.
01:25:43.095,01:25:46.348,"But was this man tall, with great big, brown puppy-dog eyes..."
01:25:46.432,01:25:48.809,"and long, silvery, flowing hair?"
01:25:48.893,01:25:50.352,You know him.
01:25:52.730,01:25:54.398,Emmett!
01:26:09.080,01:26:11.999,"Time’s up, runt."
01:26:16.921,01:26:19.923,"Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith."
01:26:20.007,01:26:22.134,"I’m right here, Tannen!"
01:26:59.380,01:27:00.714,Draw.
01:27:03.634,01:27:05.136,No!
01:27:20.526,01:27:23.320,I thought we could settle this like men.
01:27:24.321,01:27:27.491,"You thought wrong, dude."
01:28:54.245,01:28:55.871,That was good.
01:28:58.582,01:29:00.542,You know what I think?
01:29:00.626,01:29:03.379,I think Buford’s goin’ to jail.
01:29:04.380,01:29:06.507,Oh!
01:29:08.676,01:29:10.802,Get him out of that shit.
01:29:10.886,01:29:12.429,Get ’em!
01:29:16.475,01:29:21.062,"Buford Tannen, you’re under arrest for robbing the Pine City stage."
01:29:21.146,01:29:23.148,You got anything to say?
01:29:28.112,01:29:30.280,I hate manure.
01:29:30.364,01:29:31.407,Look!
01:29:34.994,01:29:37.787,Yes!
01:29:37.871,01:29:39.956,The train!
01:29:40.040,01:29:42.209,We’ll have to cut ’em off at Coyote Pass.
01:29:44.795,01:29:47.380,"Hey! Hey, mister! Mr. Eastwood."
01:29:47.464,01:29:49.090,"Here’s your gun, mister."
01:29:49.174,01:29:51.093,"Thanks, kid."
01:29:55.347,01:29:57.891,Seamus.
01:29:57.975,01:30:00.144,It’s worth $12. Never been used.
01:30:01.478,01:30:04.064,Maybe I’ll trade it for a new hat.
01:30:07.192,01:30:09.486,I will!
01:30:15.284,01:30:16.785,Emmett!
01:30:18.495,01:30:21.456,Emmett!
01:30:27.338,01:30:29.340,Time machine.
01:30:47.900,01:30:49.610,Hyah! Hyah!
01:31:12.800,01:31:16.011,"- Come on, Marty! - Hyah! Hah!"
01:31:16.679,01:31:18.138,Jump!
01:31:18.222,01:31:20.391,Come on! Give me your hand!
01:31:26.897,01:31:29.650,Oh! Aah!
01:31:50.337,01:31:52.756,Whoa!
01:31:55.759,01:31:57.344,"Come on, Marty!"
01:31:57.428,01:31:59.179,Whoa!
01:32:01.932,01:32:03.517,"Come on, let’s go!"
01:32:11.275,01:32:12.943,Masks on.
01:32:29.376,01:32:30.961,Is this a holdup?
01:32:32.671,01:32:35.215,It’s a science experiment.
01:32:35.299,01:32:38.302,Stop the train just before you hit the switch track up ahead.
01:32:54.026,01:32:57.279,- Doc! - Uncouple the cars from the tender!
01:33:24.014,01:33:26.350,I’ve wanted to do that all my life!
01:33:59.883,01:34:02.677,What are these things anyway?
01:34:02.761,01:34:04.637,Compressed wood with anthracite dust...
01:34:04.721,01:34:06.931,chemically treated to burn hotter and longer.
01:34:07.015,01:34:09.642,I use ’em in my forge so I don’t have to stoke it.
01:34:09.726,01:34:15.858,"These three in the furnace will ignite sequentially, make the fire burn hotter, kick up the boiler pressure and make the train go faster."
01:34:24.199,01:34:26.159,Hyah! Hyah!
01:34:27.744,01:34:29.872,Ready to roll!
01:35:00.777,01:35:02.279,Emmett!
01:35:07.117,01:35:09.744,"Marty, are the time circuits on?"
01:35:09.828,01:35:11.788,"Check, Doc!"
01:35:11.872,01:35:18.586,"Input the destination time– October 27, 1985, 11:00 a.m."
01:35:20.797,01:35:23.925,"Okay, we’re cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc!"
01:35:35.479,01:35:39.023,"Marty, the new gauge on the dashboard will tell us the boiler temperature."
01:35:39.107,01:35:44.237,"It’s color-coded to indicate when each log will fire– green, yellow and red."
01:35:44.321,01:35:48.575,Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration.
01:35:48.659,01:35:50.577,Hyah! Hyah!
01:35:50.661,01:35:55.456,"Hopefully we’ll hit 88 miles per hour before the needle gets much past 2,000."
01:35:55.540,01:35:58.418,"Why? Wh-What happens after it hits 2,000?"
01:35:58.502,01:36:00.295,The whole boiler explodes.
01:36:01.338,01:36:02.339,Perfect.
01:36:18.271,01:36:20.106,"Hey, Doc, we just hit 35!"
01:36:20.190,01:36:22.943,"Okay, Marty, I’m coming aboard!"
01:36:32.911,01:36:35.998,Emmett! Emmett!
01:36:38.583,01:36:40.377,"Come on, come on."
01:36:49.553,01:36:52.973,"You better hold on to somethin’, Doc! The yellow log’s about to blow!"
01:36:54.933,01:36:56.851,- Aah! - Oh!
01:36:56.935,01:36:59.229,Golly!
01:37:02.899,01:37:04.568,"We just passed 40, Doc!"
01:37:37.350,01:37:38.894,Emmett!
01:37:40.771,01:37:43.940,"We just passed 45, Doc! Go for it!"
01:38:06.421,01:38:08.589,- Emmett! - Clara!
01:38:08.673,01:38:11.802,I love you!
01:38:13.136,01:38:15.138,"Doc! Doc, what’s happening?"
01:38:15.222,01:38:18.725,It’s Clara! She’s on the train!
01:38:18.809,01:38:20.727,Clara? Perfect.
01:38:20.811,01:38:24.731,She’s in the cab! I’m gonna go back for her!
01:38:24.815,01:38:26.983,The windmill! Doc!
01:38:27.067,01:38:30.153,The windmill! We’re going past 50! You’ll never make it!
01:38:31.822,01:38:36.367,Then we’ll have to take her back with us! Keep calling out the speed!
01:38:36.451,01:38:39.328,Clara! Climb out here to me!
01:38:39.412,01:38:41.247,I don’t know if I can!
01:38:41.331,01:38:45.168,You can do it! Just don’t look down!
01:38:48.672,01:38:49.923,That’s it!
01:39:03.520,01:39:05.689,"Sixty miles an hour, Doc!"
01:39:08.859,01:39:12.821,You’re doing fine! Nice and steady.
01:39:15.115,01:39:19.660,Come on! Just a little further!
01:39:19.744,01:39:21.872,"I can’t, Emmett! I’m scared!"
01:39:23.623,01:39:25.292,Seventy!
01:39:26.168,01:39:28.211,"Keep coming, Clara!"
01:39:29.379,01:39:32.382,Come on! Come on! You’re doing fine!
01:39:33.592,01:39:35.384,Come on!
01:39:35.468,01:39:37.804,Nice and easy!
01:39:37.888,01:39:41.391,Don’t look down! That’s it! You’re doing fine!
01:39:43.935,01:39:47.689,"Doc, the red log’s about to blow!"
01:39:55.780,01:39:57.573,Clara!
01:39:57.657,01:39:59.242,Oh!
01:39:59.326,01:40:01.661,Emmett! Aah!
01:40:11.504,01:40:14.757,"- I’m trying to reach you! - Clara, hold on!"
01:40:14.841,01:40:16.801,I can’t– Aah!
01:40:23.642,01:40:25.601,Oh!
01:40:25.685,01:40:27.896,"Doc, I’m gonna slip you the hoverboard!"
01:40:35.654,01:40:37.113,Marty! Watch out!
01:40:49.834,01:40:51.377,"Hold on, Clara!"
01:40:54.798,01:40:56.299,"Doc! Ready, Doc?"
01:40:57.300,01:40:58.635,Catch it!
01:41:00.136,01:41:01.638,Yes! Yes!
01:41:12.315,01:41:15.943,- Emmett! - Hold on!
01:41:18.655,01:41:20.573,Yes!
01:43:06.846,01:43:08.556,"Oh, shit."
01:44:00.066,01:44:04.654,"Well, Doc, it’s destroyed."
01:44:06.990,01:44:09.117,Just like you wanted.
01:44:28.094,01:44:30.221,"Hey, butt head, get away– Watch it, Biff!"
01:44:30.305,01:44:32.223,Marty! I didn’t mean to scare you.
01:44:32.307,01:44:34.767,I didn’t recognize you in those clothes.
01:44:34.851,01:44:37.270,"Uh, just puttin’ on the second coat now."
01:44:38.855,01:44:41.774,"You goin’ cowboy, huh?"
01:44:41.858,01:44:44.402,We’re gonna be late for brunch!
01:44:44.486,01:44:46.779,"Come on, Dad. They’re not gonna hold the reservations all day."
01:44:46.863,01:44:50.282,I can’t find my other glasses. Have you seen my glasses?
01:44:50.366,01:44:52.243,"They’re in your suede jacket, honey."
01:44:52.327,01:44:54.912,"Marty, what’s wrong? We thought you went to the lake."
01:44:54.996,01:44:56.455,You wore that to the lake?
01:44:56.539,01:44:58.374,Thank God. You guys are all back to normal.
01:44:58.458,01:45:00.751,"Hey, Marty. Who you supposed to be, Clint Eastwood?"
01:45:00.835,01:45:04.130,Right. I gotta go get Jennifer.
01:45:08.218,01:45:10.136,"I really like that hat, Marty."
01:45:10.220,01:45:11.721,"Thanks, Biff."
01:45:25.902,01:45:27.403,Jennifer.
01:45:29.572,01:45:31.074,Jen.
01:45:34.911,01:45:37.205,Jennifer.
01:45:39.290,01:45:40.792,Mmm.
01:45:42.377,01:45:43.878,Mmm.
01:46:01.938,01:46:03.439,Marty!
01:46:04.857,01:46:06.901,I had the worst nightmare.
01:46:13.199,01:46:16.702,"Marty, that dream I had is so real."
01:46:16.786,01:46:21.373,"It was about the future, about us."
01:46:21.457,01:46:23.542,And you got fired.
01:46:23.626,01:46:26.128,"Wait a minute. What do you mean, I got fired?"
01:46:29.465,01:46:31.467,Hilldale. This is where we live.
01:46:32.927,01:46:38.600,"I-I mean, this is, uh– this is where we’re gonna live... some day."
01:46:41.644,01:46:44.980,"Marty, it was a dream, wasn’t it?"
01:46:49.652,01:46:52.404,The big M.
01:46:52.488,01:46:54.490,"How’s it hangin’, McFly?"
01:46:54.574,01:46:58.244,"- Hey, Needles. - Nice set of wheels."
01:46:58.328,01:47:01.372,Let’s see what she can do. Next green light.
01:47:01.456,01:47:03.582,"No, thanks."
01:47:03.666,01:47:06.252,What’s the matter? Chicken?
01:47:11.758,01:47:13.843,Grab ahold of something.
01:47:14.844,01:47:16.595,Come on! Get on it!
01:47:40.036,01:47:41.620,Oh!
01:47:44.290,01:47:46.792,Yeah. You think I’m stupid enough to race that asshole?
01:47:52.924,01:47:57.053,Geez. I would’ve hit that Rolls-Royce.
01:48:05.812,01:48:07.563,It erased.
01:48:21.411,01:48:23.538,You’re right. There’s not much left.
01:48:25.998,01:48:28.167,Doc’s never comin’ back.
01:48:42.432,01:48:44.433,"I’m sure gonna miss him, Jen."
01:48:56.946,01:48:58.697,What the hell?
01:49:15.465,01:49:18.133,- Doc! - Marty!
01:49:18.217,01:49:20.386,Doc! Doc!
01:49:20.470,01:49:23.389,Marty! It runs on steam.
01:49:28.603,01:49:30.604,Meet the family.
01:49:30.688,01:49:33.232,Clara you know.
01:49:33.316,01:49:34.609,Ma’am.
01:49:35.651,01:49:37.778,These are our boys.
01:49:37.862,01:49:39.781,Jules...
01:49:41.115,01:49:42.450,and Verne.
01:49:45.453,01:49:48.790,"Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer."
01:49:51.292,01:49:53.335,"Doc, I thought I’d never see you again!"
01:49:53.419,01:49:55.671,You can’t keep a good scientist down.
01:49:55.755,01:50:01.260,"After all, I had to come back for Einstein, and, well, I didn’t want you to be worried about me."
01:50:01.344,01:50:03.095,Oh.
01:50:03.179,01:50:05.848,I brought you a little souvenir.
01:50:22.365,01:50:24.783,"It’s great, Doc."
01:50:24.867,01:50:26.786,Thanks.
01:50:27.745,01:50:29.288,Dr. Brown?
01:50:29.372,01:50:34.126,"I brought this note back from the future, and now it’s erased."
01:50:34.210,01:50:37.046,Of course it’s erased!
01:50:38.005,01:50:39.465,But what does that mean?
01:50:39.549,01:50:43.260,It means your future hasn’t been written yet.
01:50:43.344,01:50:45.137,No one’s has.
01:50:45.221,01:50:51.143,"Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one, both of you."
01:50:53.271,01:50:54.813,"We will, Doc."
01:50:54.897,01:50:56.315,Stand back!
01:50:56.399,01:50:58.901,"All right, boys. Buckle up!"
01:51:03.865,01:51:05.324,"Hey, Doc!"
01:51:05.408,01:51:09.077,Where you going now? Back to the future?
01:51:09.161,01:51:12.039,Nope. Already been there.
