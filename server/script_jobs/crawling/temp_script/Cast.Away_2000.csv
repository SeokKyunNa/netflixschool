00:02:39.451,00:02:41.787,Mrs. Peterson!
00:02:41.787,00:02:44.372,"Ramon, hey!"
00:02:44.372,00:02:46.583,How you doin'?
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.752,"There it is, right there on the desk."
00:02:48.752,00:02:50.295,Where's she headed?
00:02:50.295,00:02:52.006,"She's snowbound, Ramon."
00:02:55.968,00:02:57.385,See you went with the pink.
00:02:57.385,00:02:58.929,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:58.929,00:03:01.306,It's kind of a pink day today.
00:03:01.306,00:03:04.267,I'm gonna have another pickup for you on Thursday.
00:03:04.267,00:03:05.560,All right.
00:03:05.560,00:03:07.021,"All right. Thanks, Ramon."
00:03:43.015,00:03:44.432,Peterson!
00:03:45.559,00:03:47.811,Peterson.
00:03:50.313,00:03:53.067,"Mr. Cowboy, da?"
00:03:57.529,00:04:00.532,"Mmm, it's pretty."
00:04:00.532,00:04:03.785,Mmm.
00:05:10.351,00:05:12.479,MAN: Time...
00:05:12.479,00:05:22.447,"rules over us without mercy, not caring if we're healthy or ill, hungry or drunk, Russian, American, beings from Mars."
00:05:22.447,00:05:23.782,It's like a fire.
00:05:23.782,00:05:25.533,It could either destroy us or keep us warm.
00:05:25.533,00:05:28.036,That's why every FedEx office has a clock.
00:05:28.036,00:05:30.914,Because we live or we die by the clock.
00:05:30.914,00:05:32.958,We never turn our back on it.
00:05:32.958,00:05:38.630,"And we never, ever allow ourselves the sin of losing track of time!"
00:05:38.630,00:05:40.590,"Locally, it's 1:56."
00:05:40.590,00:05:46.596,That means we've got three hours and four minutes before the end-of-the-day's package sort.
00:05:46.596,00:05:48.932,That's how long we have.
00:05:50.976,00:05:56.606,"before this pulsating, accursed, relentless taskmaster tries to put us out of business."
00:05:56.606,00:05:59.776,"Hey, Nicolai."
00:05:59.776,00:06:01.778,"How are you, kid?"
00:06:01.778,00:06:04.072,You just delivered your very first FedEx package.
00:06:04.072,00:06:07.742,"That deserves something special, like a Snickers bar..."
00:06:07.742,00:06:10.662,and a C.D. player.
00:06:10.662,00:06:12.747,And something to listen to-- a C.D. There.
00:06:12.747,00:06:13.957,Elvis Presley.
00:06:13.957,00:06:15.667,Fifty million fans can't be wrong.
00:06:15.667,00:06:17.711,"You all recognize this, don't you?"
00:06:17.711,00:06:20.421,I took the liberty of sending this to myself.
00:06:20.421,00:06:25.468,I FedEx'd it before I left Memphis.
00:06:25.468,00:06:27.721,You're probably wondering what could be in here.
00:06:27.721,00:06:30.057,What could it possibly be?
00:06:30.057,00:06:31.975,Maybe technical drawings?
00:06:31.975,00:06:34.895,Is this the new wallpaper for the-- for the bathroom?
00:06:36.855,00:06:46.740,"It is...a clock, which I started at absolute zero and is now at 87 hours, 22 minutes and 17 seconds."
00:06:46.740,00:06:51.661,"From Memphis, America to Nicolai in Russia, 87 hours."
00:06:51.661,00:06:55.082,Eighty-seven hours is a shameful outrage.
00:06:55.082,00:06:58.168,This is just an egg timer!
00:06:58.168,00:06:59.586,What if it had been something else?
00:06:59.586,00:07:01.129,Like your paycheck?
00:07:01.129,00:07:04.299,Or fresh boysenberries?
00:07:04.299,00:07:06.509,Eighty-seven hours is an eternity.
00:07:06.509,00:07:08.511,The cosmos was created in less time!
00:07:08.511,00:07:11.431,Wars have been fought and nations toppled in 87 hours!
00:07:11.431,00:07:13.433,Fortunes made and squandered.
00:07:17.562,00:07:19.480,What?
00:07:19.480,00:07:21.566,What are you saying about me?
00:07:21.566,00:07:23.526,"I tell them, what do they expect?"
00:07:23.526,00:07:27.239,"This man, when his truck broke down, he stole a boy's bicycle to do his delivery."
00:07:27.239,00:07:30.075,I borrowed it!
00:07:30.075,00:07:33.954,"And I got my packages delivered, and that is what you people are gonna have to start doing."
00:07:33.954,00:07:42.087,"You have to start doing whatever it takes, because in three hours and two minutes, every one of these packages has to be on the big truck and on its way to the airport."
00:07:42.087,00:07:44.839,Fifteen minutes!
00:07:44.839,00:07:46.507,Crunch time! Crunch time!
00:07:46.507,00:07:48.093,Crunch time!
00:07:48.093,00:07:51.471,Let's go! Every package on the airport truck.
00:07:51.471,00:07:53.681,Go!
00:07:53.681,00:07:55.683,We have a big problem.
00:07:55.683,00:07:57.018,The truck in Red Square is stuck.
00:07:57.018,00:07:59.479,What do you mean?
00:07:59.479,00:08:01.189,Stuck how?
00:08:01.189,00:08:03.108,It's stuck!
00:08:01.189,00:08:04.859,The most important truck-- the Kremlin truck!
00:08:14.828,00:08:17.331,"All right, all right, all right."
00:08:17.331,00:08:19.082,We'll just do the sort.
00:08:19.082,00:08:22.336,"Ah, yeah, a clamp."
00:08:22.336,00:08:24.921,Let's go. Unload-- Get him out of there.
00:08:24.921,00:08:27.799,Right here.
00:08:27.799,00:08:30.093,"One to the airport truck, one to the Moscow truck."
00:08:30.093,00:08:32.346,Got it?
00:08:32.346,00:08:34.555,"C.D.G., F.E., M.E, Memphis on the airport truck."
00:08:34.555,00:08:36.141,Everything else right there.
00:08:36.141,00:08:38.643,"Nicolai! Tick-tock, tick-tock."
00:08:40.895,00:08:43.898,"Hi, this is Kelly. If you're calling for Chuck, press one."
00:08:43.898,00:08:45.942,Otherwise leave a message after the tone. Thanks.
00:08:47.277,00:08:49.279,"CHUCK: Hello, Kelly."
00:08:49.279,00:08:51.365,"Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. You're not there."
00:08:51.365,00:08:53.325,You're not gonna believe this.
00:08:51.365,00:08:55.952,I'm doin' the sorts in the middle of Red Square in the shadow of Lenin's tomb.
00:08:59.706,00:09:05.545,"I'm outta here in two minutes and I'm pickin' up the sweep through Paris, so I should be back in Memphis about 18 hours or so."
00:09:05.545,00:09:07.797,That's the good news.
00:09:07.797,00:09:09.799,I gotta go to the dentist this week.
00:09:09.799,00:09:11.801,I got something in there that's hurtin'.
00:09:11.801,00:09:14.846,"I love you and I'm gonna see you soon, and you know what that means."
00:09:14.846,00:09:16.264,Bye-bye.
00:09:16.264,00:09:18.308,"Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!"
00:09:36.076,00:09:38.870,"I absolutely, positively have to get to Memphis tonight."
00:09:38.870,00:09:41.081,Can't help you.
00:09:41.081,00:09:44.418,"With this extra head wind, are we gonna be able to push it and make the sort?"
00:09:44.418,00:09:46.253,We'll do our best.
00:09:46.253,00:09:50.673,"Gwen, is there something wrong with our doctors that Jack keeps getting certified to fly?"
00:09:50.673,00:09:52.967,Aren't you concerned?
00:09:52.967,00:09:55.011,But a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.
00:09:55.011,00:09:57.972,That's the spirit. Relentless is our goal. Relentless!
00:09:57.972,00:10:03.811,What do you expect from the guy who stole a crippled kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
00:10:03.811,00:10:05.939,But I love that the kid's now crippled.
00:10:05.939,00:10:08.525,So you missed the last truck by two minutes?
00:10:08.525,00:10:11.486,Two minutes.
00:10:11.486,00:10:14.489,The plane wasn't that heavy.
00:10:11.486,00:10:16.575,"You could've added some fuel, picked up the speed and made up the time."
00:10:16.575,00:10:17.784,It's about the trucks.
00:10:17.784,00:10:19.619,Today's truck was two minutes late.
00:10:19.619,00:10:23.331,"Tomorrow's will be four minutes late, and then six minutes and eight minutes late."
00:10:23.331,00:10:24.832,"Next thing you know, we're the U.S. Mail."
00:10:24.832,00:10:32.257,"Yeah, well-- Alls I'm sayin' is, if you'd gotten all those trucks on the plane, those Russkies would be walking on water right now."
00:10:32.257,00:10:34.926,"Hey, don't-- Don't gimme that look."
00:10:34.926,00:10:36.428,It's just grape juice.
00:10:36.428,00:10:37.804,Yeah.
00:10:37.804,00:10:40.599,It's like a 1992 full-bodied grape juice.
00:10:40.599,00:10:42.976,"I see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."
00:10:42.976,00:10:46.313,"We'd offer you some but, you know, somebody's got to fly the plane."
00:10:46.313,00:10:49.899,"Yeah, well, I just say no, right?"
00:10:49.899,00:10:52.860,"Listen, Stan, I've been meaning to ask you."
00:10:52.860,00:10:54.988,How's Mary?
00:10:54.988,00:10:59.867,"Oh. Uh, well, we really don't know anything yet."
00:10:59.867,00:11:01.495,Mm-hmm.
00:11:01.495,00:11:10.337,"Uh, she went to the doctor yesterday, and, uh, it hasn't meta-- metastasized..."
00:11:10.337,00:11:13.340,as far as they can tell right now.
00:11:13.340,00:11:16.426,It's just kind of wait and see.
00:11:16.426,00:11:18.719,I'm so sorry.
00:11:18.719,00:11:21.973,Tell her I'm gonna come by and see her on my next layover.
00:11:21.973,00:11:25.352,"I want you to know, Stan, we are all thinking about her and you."
00:11:25.352,00:11:27.854,And just blessings.
00:11:27.854,00:11:30.898,"Hi, this is Kelly. If you're calling for Chuck, press one."
00:11:30.898,00:11:33.985,"Otherwise, leave a message after the tone. Thanks."
00:11:38.198,00:11:41.117,Stan.
00:11:41.117,00:11:43.537,Listen.
00:11:41.117,00:11:48.458,"Uh, I heard about this-- I heard about this doctor down in Emory, in Atlanta."
00:11:48.458,00:11:50.502,"Uh, he's supposed to be the absolute best."
00:11:50.502,00:11:52.671,He worked on Frank Toretta's wife.
00:11:52.671,00:11:54.713,Frank Toretta is a systems analyst.
00:11:54.713,00:11:57.175,He played center field for us.
00:11:57.175,00:12:00.136,In the softball tournament last Labor Day.
00:12:00.136,00:12:02.055,"Anyway, beside the point."
00:12:02.055,00:12:15.943,"Uh, what I was thinking is, is that I could get his number-- the doctor-- and, uh, you know, put you all together and-- You know, you could get this thing fixed."
00:12:15.943,00:12:17.904,You could beat it.
00:12:19.197,00:12:20.574,"Thanks, Chuck."
00:12:20.574,00:12:23.660,"So, I'll get his number."
00:12:46.099,00:12:47.684,Is Kelly Frears around?
00:12:47.684,00:12:49.352,She's copying her dissertation.
00:13:21.384,00:13:23.970,You're home.
00:13:23.970,00:13:25.972,I love that you're home.
00:13:45.158,00:13:51.998,"Just days before Santa departs on his annual gift-giving venture, he's been declared physically fit to fly."
00:13:51.998,00:13:55.960,"Santa got checked out by doctors at the V.A. Hospital in Augusta, Georgia."
00:13:55.960,00:14:02.467,"After they declared the jolly old elf in tiptop shape, Santa Claus took off into the wild blue yonder for an early start."
00:14:02.467,00:14:10.183,"In Sarajevo, he spent the day with children, handing out presents and even helping them decorate the special Christmas tree."
00:14:14.145,00:14:16.439,Santa and a sea of elves took over the floor...
00:14:16.439,00:14:18.483,at the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.
00:14:18.483,00:14:45.593,"Market traders bought Santa hats, donating-- The turkey's a little dry, isn't it?"
00:14:45.593,00:14:48.304,ALL: No.
00:14:51.932,00:14:53.267,How many did you do last night?
00:14:53.267,00:14:55.353,Last night? 2.9 million.
00:14:55.353,00:14:59.023,Now you've got to be in the market for more of these candied yams.
00:14:59.023,00:15:00.358,Here you go.
00:15:00.358,00:15:02.569,2.9 has got to be the record.
00:15:02.569,00:15:04.529,Look at those marshmallows.
00:15:04.529,00:15:06.364,"When I was there, we did two million."
00:15:06.364,00:15:07.657,We thought that was a big deal.
00:15:07.657,00:15:08.867,The glory days.
00:15:08.867,00:15:10.577,What'd they do the first night?
00:15:10.577,00:15:11.952,The very first night?
00:15:11.952,00:15:13.830,MAN 1: Twelve.
00:15:13.830,00:15:16.499,"Hell, no. Twelve."
00:15:16.499,00:15:19.377,And they did the sort right there on a card table.
00:15:19.377,00:15:22.338,And Fred Smith had that card table bronzed.
00:15:22.338,00:15:25.132,I've been hearing that for five years.
00:15:25.132,00:15:26.634,It's in his office today.
00:15:26.634,00:15:29.387,They go from that to the new hub up in Anchorage.
00:15:29.387,00:15:33.892,It's state of the art-- a perfect marriage between technology and systems management.
00:15:33.892,00:15:37.478,"Speaking of marriage, Chuck, when are you gonna make an honest woman out of Kelly?"
00:15:39.063,00:15:41.900,How long?
00:15:41.900,00:15:45.319,You won. I owe you $5.
00:15:45.319,00:15:47.405,Way before the pie.
00:15:47.405,00:15:54.036,"Right about the time the pie came out, the marriage-- Kelly is still recovering from her failed relationship with that parolee."
00:15:54.036,00:15:55.914,He was a lawyer.
00:15:55.914,00:16:00.334,I knew it had something to do with raising your right hand and swearing to tell the truth.
00:16:00.334,00:16:03.922,Remember when he fell on the sidewalk and broke his shoulder at the wedding reception?
00:16:03.922,00:16:06.466,He tripped on a curb holding a door open for me.
00:16:06.466,00:16:07.842,Aunt Kelly was married before?
00:16:07.842,00:16:09.677,KELLY: It's not even worth remembering.
00:16:09.677,00:16:14.432,"So since her failed marriage to the parolee-- Oh, my God."
00:16:14.432,00:16:17.769,Kelly can't see being with a man who wears a pager to bed.
00:16:17.769,00:16:19.813,"What're you gonna attach it to, Hoss?"
00:16:19.813,00:16:24.609,"When you wear it to bed, I hope you got one of those things that go vibratin'."
00:16:24.609,00:16:27.236,Watch it.
00:16:27.236,00:16:30.740,"Oh, did you hit an olive pit?"
00:16:30.740,00:16:32.158,I thought I took all of them out.
00:16:32.158,00:16:35.035,"No, no, it's not that."
00:17:01.479,00:17:03.648,"Okay, I'll cancel Saturday."
00:17:03.648,00:17:05.566,"If I'm not here, I'm not."
00:17:03.648,00:17:07.610,"But if I am, well, then I am."
00:17:07.610,00:17:09.612,But you gotta be here New Year's Eve.
00:17:09.612,00:17:12.239,Malaysia can't be that bad.
00:17:12.239,00:17:13.950,When are you defending your dissertation?
00:17:13.950,00:17:15.910,January 12.
00:17:15.910,00:17:19.288,I'm gonna have to switch over the South America thing.
00:17:19.288,00:17:23.584,"If I do that on the third or fourth, I'm gonna have to head back out on the 13th."
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.962,So long as you're here New Year's Eve.
00:17:25.962,00:17:29.048,I will be here New Year's Eve.
00:17:32.385,00:17:33.970,What?
00:17:33.970,00:17:36.389,What about our Christmas?
00:17:39.392,00:17:41.394,We have to do it in the car.
00:17:46.983,00:17:49.276,"CHUCK: I'd just like a minute over here, all right?"
00:17:49.276,00:17:52.405,Thanks.
00:17:56.701,00:17:59.245,"CHUCK: Two minutes, okay?"
00:17:59.245,00:18:01.497,Two more minutes.
00:18:01.497,00:18:02.707,Merry Christmas.
00:18:02.707,00:18:04.709,I thought you were gonna stiff me.
00:18:04.709,00:18:06.586,What is the ribbon?
00:18:04.709,00:18:09.005,Is it a thousand-pound test fishing line or something?
00:18:09.005,00:18:10.757,Here's your fancy thing.
00:18:10.757,00:18:13.676,Thanks.
00:18:15.929,00:18:18.056,I love the wrapping.
00:18:19.599,00:18:21.726,And I love the box.
00:18:24.311,00:18:28.441,"Oh. Oh, my."
00:18:29.567,00:18:31.611,"Oh, that is terrific."
00:18:31.611,00:18:34.072,My grandaddy used it on the Southern Pacific.
00:18:36.699,00:18:40.453,"Hey, I took this. This is my favorite picture of you."
00:18:42.204,00:18:46.166,You know what I'm gonna do?
00:18:46.166,00:18:48.086,on Memphis time.
00:18:51.756,00:18:53.007,Kelly time.
00:18:53.007,00:18:54.592,Hmm.
00:18:54.592,00:18:56.719,You haven't said anything about your presents.
00:18:56.719,00:18:57.887,Is there a problem?
00:18:57.887,00:18:59.097,"I'm sorry, no!"
00:18:59.097,00:19:01.682,Look at my journal.
00:19:01.682,00:19:03.059,What about the pager?
00:19:03.059,00:19:05.311,Real leather.
00:19:05.311,00:19:07.521,Did you like the pager or not?
00:19:07.521,00:19:11.358,I love it. Look at him in his little blue Russian house.
00:19:11.358,00:19:14.278,It's from Russia.
00:19:14.278,00:19:15.696,It's not one of those loud ones?
00:19:15.696,00:19:20.534,No. You can program it so it vibrates and lights up and see it in the dark.
00:19:20.534,00:19:24.789,It seems like a real nice pager.
00:19:24.789,00:19:26.290,Sorry about the hand towels.
00:19:26.290,00:19:28.417,"No, no. I love 'em."
00:19:28.417,00:19:31.045,"Every time I wash my hands, I will think of you."
00:19:31.045,00:19:32.630,"All right, I gotta go."
00:19:32.630,00:19:35.382,Merry Christmas.
00:19:35.382,00:19:36.634,Merry Christmas.
00:19:36.634,00:19:38.636,I love you.
00:19:46.144,00:19:49.063,Chuck! Keys!
00:19:58.906,00:20:00.407,Thank you.
00:20:00.407,00:20:02.076,That reminds me.
00:20:02.076,00:20:05.454,I have one more present for you.
00:20:05.454,00:20:10.835,Only this isn't an open in the car kind of present...
00:20:10.835,00:20:12.753,"like, say, hand towels."
00:20:12.753,00:20:15.255,"Which were a joke, by the way."
00:20:19.385,00:20:22.013,I'm terrified.
00:20:22.013,00:20:28.019,"Just take it and hold onto it, and you can open it on New Year's Eve."
00:20:28.019,00:20:30.021,And I love you.
00:20:33.733,00:20:36.485,I'll be right back.
00:21:20.404,00:21:23.116,"Hey, Al, where are we?"
00:21:23.116,00:21:25.159,Somewhere over the Pacific Ocean.
00:21:25.159,00:21:27.703,"Ha, ha, ha!"
00:21:27.703,00:21:30.164,"Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:21:30.164,00:21:36.170,Position Jenna at 1526-- Is all this turbulence from Santa and those eight tiny reindeer?
00:21:36.170,00:21:38.714,Tamara at 1620.
00:21:38.714,00:21:40.967,Erick is next.
00:21:40.967,00:21:42.635,Fuel: niner-five-decimal-five.
00:21:44.262,00:21:46.346,"Blaine, tell them we're deviating south for weather."
00:21:46.346,00:21:48.432,Make another position plot on your deviation left.
00:21:48.432,00:21:51.227,"BLAINE: Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:21:51.227,00:21:53.854,Position Jenna at 1526.
00:21:53.854,00:21:56.274,Flight level 350.
00:21:56.274,00:21:59.152,We're 200 miles south of our original course.
00:21:59.152,00:22:02.280,"KEVIN: Continue plotting, and check contingency procedures."
00:22:02.280,00:22:04.198,"Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:22:04.198,00:22:06.284,Broadcasting in the blind.
00:22:07.827,00:22:09.703,BLAINE: I've never been out of comm this long.
00:22:09.703,00:22:12.248,Did you try the higher H.F. frequency?
00:22:12.248,00:22:14.792,"BLAINE: Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:22:14.792,00:22:17.837,"AL: Better buckle up, Chuck."
00:22:17.837,00:22:20.798,"BLAINE: Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:22:20.798,00:22:23.009,Do you read?
00:22:31.309,00:22:33.477,"Tahiti Control, FedEx 88."
00:22:33.477,00:22:36.522,Position Jenna at 1526.
00:22:36.522,00:22:38.649,Flight level 350.
00:22:38.649,00:22:40.609,Expecting Tamara at 1...
00:23:21.817,00:23:25.029,Fire! Explosion!
00:23:25.029,00:23:26.989,Let's get a hose!

00:23:35.164,00:23:37.333,Seat belt!
00:23:43.421,00:23:46.466,We may have to ditch!
00:23:55.851,00:23:57.895,Okay?
00:23:58.604,00:24:00.398,Fire in the hold!
00:24:00.398,00:24:02.482,We're goin' down!
00:24:02.482,00:24:04.985,Mayday! Mayday!
00:24:15.453,00:24:17.831,Bringing it down and out!
00:24:17.831,00:24:21.001,Ten thousand feet!
00:24:21.001,00:24:23.421,Masks off!
00:24:25.339,00:24:28.592,AL: Chuck! Life vest!

00:25:03.501,00:25:06.546,Where's your life vest?
00:25:30.196,00:25:32.156,Ditching switch on!
00:25:46.170,00:25:48.922,I've got visual!
00:25:53.010,00:25:55.595,Brace for impact!
00:34:47.252,00:34:49.629,Hello!
00:36:31.148,00:36:33.608,Hello!
00:36:33.608,00:36:35.568,Anybody!
00:36:47.246,00:36:49.374,Anybody!
00:36:53.670,00:36:56.506,Help!
00:36:56.506,00:36:58.508,Help!
00:39:05.927,00:39:07.887,What is that?
00:39:11.183,00:39:13.685,Hey!
00:39:25.113,00:39:27.157,Hey!
00:39:27.157,00:39:29.909,Anybody?
00:43:40.368,00:43:42.579,Hello?
00:47:36.187,00:47:39.691,"Get! Go, go."
00:48:37.582,00:48:40.626,Albert R. Miller.
00:48:40.626,00:48:43.962,Not Alan. Albert.
00:50:04.376,00:50:06.796,"So, that's it."
00:53:02.888,00:53:05.016,Hey! A ship!
00:53:05.016,00:53:07.434,Hey! Hey!
00:53:07.434,00:53:09.478,Hey! Hey!
00:53:09.478,00:53:11.772,A ship! Over here!
00:53:11.772,00:53:14.859,Hey! Hey!

00:53:29.165,00:53:31.750,Help me! Help!
00:53:31.750,00:53:33.752,Help! Look here!
00:53:33.752,00:53:38.841,S...O...S!
00:53:38.841,00:53:41.802,Help! Come on!
00:53:41.802,00:53:43.595,Help!
01:02:44.844,01:02:46.804,Happy birthday.
01:02:48.724,01:02:53.520,"The most beautiful thing in the world is, of course, the world itself."
01:02:53.520,01:02:55.855,"Johnny, have the happiest birthday ever. Score."
01:02:55.855,01:02:57.357,Your Grandpa.
01:04:54.683,01:04:56.685,Ew.
01:06:05.754,01:06:07.839,Come on.
01:06:07.839,01:06:10.550,Come on. Come on.
01:06:10.550,01:06:14.429,Come on. Come on.
01:10:44.866,01:10:48.119,You wouldn't have a match...
01:10:52.373,01:10:54.458,"Oh, oh, oh!"
01:11:10.600,01:11:12.268,The air got to it.
01:11:12.268,01:11:14.270,The air got to it!
01:11:56.813,01:12:00.441,"Come on, come on."
01:12:05.446,01:12:07.615,I did it. I did it.
01:12:11.286,01:12:13.412,Fire!
01:12:13.412,01:12:15.414,There you go!
01:12:15.414,01:12:17.458,Light it up!
01:12:20.336,01:12:22.588,"Ouch! Ha, ha, ha!"
01:12:22.588,01:12:24.841,Ouch!
01:12:39.230,01:12:42.317,Here you go! Here you go!
01:12:42.317,01:12:44.568,It's a signal fire!
01:12:45.653,01:12:49.115,And it spells out S.O.S!
01:12:49.115,01:12:51.117,Whoa!
01:12:52.285,01:12:54.453,It's a meteor shower!
01:12:54.453,01:12:56.539,Fireflies!
01:12:56.539,01:13:00.710,You're free! You're free!
01:13:00.710,01:13:01.961,Yeah!
01:13:01.961,01:13:03.963,Yes!
01:13:03.963,01:13:06.549,Look what I have created!
01:13:06.549,01:13:08.676,I have made fire!
01:13:08.676,01:13:12.180,I...have made fire!
01:13:24.067,01:13:26.069,Mmm!
01:13:32.950,01:13:34.911,You gotta love crab.
01:13:37.121,01:13:39.082,In the nick of time too.
01:13:41.000,01:13:44.045,I couldn't take much more of those coconuts.
01:13:44.045,01:13:46.297,Coconut milk's a natural laxative.
01:13:48.258,01:13:51.344,Things that Gilligan never told us.
01:13:51.344,01:13:53.346,Oh.
01:14:05.191,01:14:07.651,"Pretty well-made fire, huh, Wilson?"
01:14:15.576,01:14:18.871,So...Wilson.
01:14:18.871,01:14:21.165,We were en route...
01:14:21.165,01:14:25.461,from Memphis for 11 and a half hours.
01:14:25.461,01:14:29.424,About 475 miles an hour.
01:14:29.424,01:14:33.552,So they think that we are right here.
01:14:33.552,01:14:35.471,But...
01:14:35.471,01:14:38.557,we went out of radio contact...
01:14:38.557,01:14:43.020,and flew around that storm for about an hour.
01:14:43.020,01:14:45.982,"So that's a distance of what, 400 miles?"
01:14:47.566,01:14:49.568,Four hundred miles squared.
01:14:49.568,01:14:53.697,"That's 160,000..."
01:14:53.697,01:14:57.576,times pi-- 3.14.
01:15:00.288,01:15:08.838,"Five hundred and two thousand, four-- That's a search area of 500,000 square miles."
01:15:11.382,01:15:13.676,That's twice the size of Texas.
01:15:16.012,01:15:17.930,They may never find us.
01:15:42.997,01:15:45.749,This tooth is just killing me.
01:15:45.749,01:15:52.215,"It started out just hurting when I bit down, but now it just hurts all the time."
01:15:52.215,01:15:54.884,All the time.
01:15:54.884,01:15:59.889,"It's-- It's a good thing there's not much to eat around here, because I don't think I could chew it."
01:16:01.598,01:16:05.395,Just keep sucking on all that coconut and all that crab.
01:16:07.688,01:16:15.530,"And just think, I used to avoid going to the dentist like the plague."
01:16:15.530,01:16:23.204,"I put it off every single chance I got. But now, oh, what I wouldn't give..."
01:16:23.204,01:16:26.499,to have a-- a dentist right here in this cave.
01:16:31.795,01:16:34.006,"In fact, I wish you were a dentist."
01:16:39.678,01:16:41.638,Yeah.
01:16:41.638,01:16:43.724,Dr. Wilson.
01:16:54.026,01:16:56.028,You wanna hear something funny?
01:16:57.654,01:17:04.745,"Back home in Memphis, my dentist's name is Dr. James Spaulding."
01:17:24.765,01:17:27.518,She's much prettier in real life.
01:21:45.693,01:21:47.695,Shut up!
01:22:52.593,01:22:54.595,Bakersfield?
01:22:58.724,01:23:01.602,Bakersfield!
01:23:58.200,01:24:00.160,This could work.
01:24:02.371,01:24:04.414,This could work.
01:24:37.364,01:24:41.201,Twenty-two-- Forty-four lashings.
01:24:43.119,01:24:45.163,Forty-four lashings.
01:24:43.119,01:24:49.418,So-- We have to make rope again.
01:24:53.505,01:24:55.883,"Wilson, we're gonna have to make a hell of a lot of rope."
01:25:02.222,01:25:05.017,Eight lashings of these structurals.
01:25:05.017,01:25:07.978,That's 24 apiece.
01:25:07.978,01:25:11.398,That'll be 100-- 160.
01:25:11.398,01:25:13.817,Here we are today.
01:25:13.817,01:25:21.992,"That gives us another month and a half until we're into March and April, which is our best chances for the high tides and the offshore breezes."
01:25:23.493,01:25:28.874,We need-- We need 424 feet...
01:25:28.874,01:25:32.461,"of good rope, plus another 50 feet, say, for miscellaneous."
01:25:32.461,01:25:37.049,Round that off to 475 feet of good rope.
01:25:37.049,01:25:49.561,"Now, if we average 15 feet a day-- Plus, we have to build it, we have to stock it, we have to launch it."
01:25:51.897,01:25:54.357,That's gonna be tight.
01:25:54.357,01:25:56.359,That is not much time.
01:25:57.569,01:26:02.407,"But we-- We live and we die by time, don't we?"
01:26:04.576,01:26:08.538,"Now, let's not commit the sin of turning our back on time."
01:26:13.627,01:26:15.963,I know.
01:26:15.963,01:26:19.008,I know.
01:26:38.234,01:26:40.362,This is it.
01:26:42.698,01:26:45.742,That's all that's left.
01:26:45.742,01:26:49.038,"I checked over the whole island, and that is all that's left."
01:26:49.038,01:26:50.998,So we're gonna be short.
01:26:54.292,01:26:56.294,Short.
01:27:03.177,01:27:05.428,We'll just have to make some more out of the videotape.
01:27:07.056,01:27:09.349,Yes.
01:27:09.349,01:27:11.226,We do. We have time.
01:27:11.226,01:27:13.729,The wind's still blowing in from the west.
01:27:20.276,01:27:22.571,I know!
01:27:22.571,01:27:25.866,"Yeah, I know-- I know where there's 30 feet of extra rope!"
01:27:25.866,01:27:29.411,But-- But I'm not going back up there.
01:28:41.650,01:28:44.653,"There, there."
01:28:44.653,01:28:47.489,There.
01:28:53.912,01:28:55.789,Do you have to keep bringing that up?
01:28:55.789,01:28:58.125,Can't you just forget it?
01:28:58.125,01:29:00.627,Huh? You were right.
01:29:01.753,01:29:03.172,You were right.
01:29:03.172,01:29:07.676,"It was a good thing that we did a test, 'cause it wasn't gonna be just a quick little snap."
01:29:07.676,01:29:10.804,I would have landed on the rocks.
01:29:10.804,01:29:14.474,Broken my leg or my back or my neck.
01:29:14.474,01:29:16.143,Bled to death.
01:29:16.143,01:29:18.603,"But it was the only option I had at the time though, okay?"
01:29:18.603,01:29:21.190,"It was what, a year ago?"
01:29:21.190,01:29:23.150,So let's just forget it.
01:29:27.779,01:29:29.781,And what is your point?
01:29:31.574,01:29:34.077,Well...
01:29:34.077,01:29:35.954,we might just make it.
01:29:35.954,01:29:38.081,Did that thought ever cross your brain?
01:29:39.208,01:29:43.419,"Well, regardless, I would rather take my chance out there on the ocean..."
01:29:43.419,01:29:51.845,"than to stay here and die on this shithole island, spending the rest of my life talking to a goddamn volleyball!"
01:29:57.017,01:29:59.019,Shut you up.
01:30:06.276,01:30:09.529,Wilson! Wilson!
01:30:15.994,01:30:18.330,Wilson!
01:30:19.455,01:30:22.751,Wilson!
01:30:22.751,01:30:24.086,Wilson!
01:30:26.046,01:30:28.506,Wilson.
01:30:30.466,01:30:32.426,Wilson!
01:30:33.469,01:30:38.225,"Oh, God! Wilson!"
01:30:38.225,01:30:40.185,Wilson!
01:30:45.607,01:30:47.483,Oh! Oh!
01:30:47.483,01:30:50.987,Never again.
01:30:50.987,01:30:54.324,You're okay.
01:31:13.093,01:31:15.429,"Yeah, I know you."
01:31:15.429,01:31:17.806,I know you. I know you.
01:31:22.602,01:31:26.064,"So, we okay?"
01:31:27.441,01:31:29.651,Okay?
01:31:31.569,01:31:33.738,Okay.
01:33:11.169,01:33:13.171,You still awake?
01:33:15.715,01:33:17.759,Me too.
01:33:25.141,01:33:27.102,You scared?
01:33:30.272,01:33:32.274,Me too.
01:34:49.809,01:34:53.104,Okay.
01:34:53.104,01:34:56.441,You don't have to worry about anything.
01:34:56.441,01:34:58.527,I'll do all the paddling.
01:34:58.527,01:35:00.529,You just hang on.
01:35:46.408,01:35:49.743,Not yet! Hold on!
01:36:00.589,01:36:03.757,Not yet! Not yet!
01:36:05.009,01:36:07.178,Not yet!
01:36:10.724,01:36:13.851,"Stand by, Wilson!"
01:36:13.851,01:36:16.688,Hold on!
01:36:33.955,01:36:37.333,I think we did it!
01:36:38.668,01:36:41.588,I think we did it!
01:36:41.588,01:36:43.632,Wilson!
01:36:45.675,01:36:47.677,I think we did it!
01:40:19.848,01:40:23.559,Oh! They're gone!
01:40:28.731,01:40:30.733,I don't know why!
01:41:53.232,01:41:55.317,Where's Wilson?
01:41:57.319,01:42:00.239,Where's Wilson?
01:42:00.239,01:42:02.241,"Wilson, where are you?"
01:42:03.743,01:42:05.703,Wilson!
01:42:09.707,01:42:12.460,Wilson!
01:42:12.460,01:42:14.587,Wilson!
01:42:41.823,01:42:43.365,Wilson!
01:42:43.365,01:42:45.994,I'm comin'!
01:42:47.662,01:42:49.664,Wilson!
01:43:09.475,01:43:11.686,Wilson!
01:43:11.686,01:43:21.654,Wilson-- Wilson!
01:43:27.326,01:43:29.954,Wilson! Wilson!
01:43:41.799,01:43:44.052,Wilson!
01:43:48.347,01:43:50.349,Wilson!
01:43:50.349,01:43:52.894,I'm sorry!
01:43:54.436,01:43:56.605,"I'm sorry, Wilson!"
01:43:56.605,01:43:59.358,"Wilson, I'm sorry!"
01:44:00.317,01:44:02.070,I'm sorry!
01:44:02.070,01:44:04.321,Wilson!
01:44:04.321,01:44:06.532,I can't!
01:44:06.532,01:44:08.576,Wilson!
01:44:09.744,01:44:12.205,Wilson!
01:44:49.658,01:44:52.620,I'm-- I'm sorry.
01:44:55.497,01:44:57.499,I'm sorry.
01:44:59.210,01:45:02.255,I'm sorry.
01:47:02.333,01:47:04.417,Kelly.
01:47:10.591,01:47:12.551,Kelly.
01:47:13.761,01:47:15.763,Kelly.
01:47:21.518,01:47:24.688,Hello?
01:47:26.648,01:47:28.692,Okay.
01:48:09.733,01:48:12.736,Forty-five minutes.
01:48:12.736,01:48:15.697,One Dr. Pepper.
01:48:15.697,01:48:17.741,Two cups of ice.
01:48:17.741,01:48:19.743,I like ice.
01:48:22.704,01:48:24.623,"Well, here's the drill."
01:48:24.623,01:48:30.463,"Um, plane pulls in, we get off, and there's a little ceremony right there in the hangar."
01:48:31.630,01:48:34.049,Fred Smith will say a few words.
01:48:34.049,01:48:37.719,All you have to do is smile and say thank you.
01:48:38.971,01:48:41.182,Then we'll take you over to see Kelly.
01:48:43.642,01:48:45.769,"She's actually gonna be there, huh?"
01:48:47.021,01:48:49.440,"Well, that's what we have arranged."
01:48:49.440,01:48:51.192,"I mean, if you're sure you wanna do that."
01:48:51.192,01:48:53.486,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:48:57.572,01:48:59.783,I don't know what I'm gonna say to her.
01:49:01.202,01:49:03.620,What in the world am I gonna say to her?
01:49:07.500,01:49:10.752,"Chuck, Kelly had to let you go."
01:49:10.752,01:49:13.088,You know?
01:49:13.088,01:49:15.883,She thought you were dead.
01:49:15.883,01:49:17.968,And we buried you.
01:49:19.594,01:49:23.724,We had a funeral and a coffin and a gravestone.
01:49:23.724,01:49:25.851,The whole thing.
01:49:27.061,01:49:29.063,You had a coffin?
01:49:31.773,01:49:33.775,What was in it?
01:49:34.860,01:49:37.779,"Well, everybody put something in."
01:49:37.779,01:49:42.784,"You know, just a cell phone or a beeper, some pictures."
01:49:42.784,01:49:44.828,I put in some Elvis CDs.
01:49:47.706,01:49:49.791,So you had my funeral...
01:49:51.960,01:49:54.838,and then you had Mary's funeral.
01:49:59.552,01:50:03.222,"Stan, I'm so sorry I wasn't around when Mary died."
01:50:05.598,01:50:09.520,"I should've been there for you, and I wasn't."
01:50:12.773,01:50:15.568,I'm so sorry.
01:50:15.568,01:50:22.283,"Four years ago, the FedEx family lost five of our sons."
01:50:22.283,01:50:25.369,That was a terrible and tragic day.
01:50:26.454,01:50:33.586,"But today, one of those sons, Chuck Noland, has been returned to us."
01:50:33.586,01:50:35.921,"Chuck, welcome home."
01:50:45.097,01:50:49.143,"Just moments ago, Fred Smith welcomed home Chuck Noland."
01:50:49.143,01:50:51.019,"How about it, Michelle?"
01:50:51.019,01:50:55.483,MICHELLE: It's such an incredible and amazing story to come back from the dead.
01:50:55.483,01:50:58.152,"NEWSCASTER: Well, it's so amazing that Smith welcomed him back."
01:50:58.152,01:51:03.698,"And Fred acknowledged that, While time waits for no man, we take time to pause to honor one of our own."
01:51:03.698,01:51:05.867,"Now, that's an expensive pause."
01:51:13.708,01:51:15.877,I'm-- I'm sorry.
01:51:15.877,01:51:18.755,"No, you're in the right place."
01:51:18.755,01:51:20.549,You probably don't remember me.
01:51:20.549,01:51:23.344,I actually did root canal on you about five years ago.
01:51:23.344,01:51:25.638,Jim Spaulding referred you.
01:51:27.473,01:51:29.475,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:51:34.313,01:51:36.273,I'm Kelly's husband.
01:51:37.732,01:51:40.486,Jerry Lovett.
01:51:40.486,01:51:51.955,"Kelly wanted-- Kelly wanted to be here-- Look, this is very hard for everyone."
01:51:51.955,01:51:54.791,I can't even imagine how hard it is for you.
01:51:59.588,01:52:05.594,"Kelly, uh-- She's had it rough."
01:52:05.594,01:52:10.307,"First when she thought she lost you, and now dealing with all of this."
01:52:10.307,01:52:13.935,It's-- It's confusing.
01:52:13.935,01:52:21.193,She's-- She's...sort of lost.
01:52:23.571,01:52:25.864,Maybe you could just give her a little more time.
01:52:31.453,01:53:35.183,"Anyway, uh, I'm sorry that-- Okay, people, let's go."
01:53:35.183,01:53:37.436,Party's over. Let's go home.
01:53:37.436,01:53:40.230,MAYNARD: You're definitely gonna have to go down to the DMV.
01:53:40.230,01:53:42.815,"Okay, Maynard, let's go."
01:53:42.815,01:53:46.861,"I have to brief this man on his meetings tomorrow with the accountants and the attorneys, all right?"
01:53:46.861,01:53:49.406,I will see you bright and early in the morning.
01:53:49.406,01:53:52.367,"Hey, Chuck, welcome home."
01:53:52.367,01:53:53.826,"Becca, I need to speak to you."
01:53:53.826,01:53:57.498,"You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up on some of that fishin', now."
01:53:57.498,01:53:59.583,Take care.
01:54:02.043,01:54:04.588,Good night.
01:54:07.549,01:54:10.177,You got everything you need? Okay.
01:54:10.177,01:54:14.556,"Well, if you need anything, just sign for it, and I'll see you in the morning."
01:54:14.556,01:54:15.683,"Get some sleep, okay?"
01:54:15.683,01:54:17.434,We got another big day tomorrow.
01:54:17.434,01:54:19.936,It takes a lot of paperwork to bring back a man.
01:54:21.438,01:54:23.398,"Bring you back to life, man."
01:54:23.398,01:54:24.899,"BECCA: Bye, Chuck."
01:54:24.899,01:54:27.277,"Take care, now."
01:54:27.277,01:54:29.613,Tomorrow we're gonna bring you back to life.
01:56:14.384,01:56:16.386,"How long are you gonna be, man?"
01:56:18.889,01:56:21.600,Well...
01:56:21.600,01:56:23.268,how long will that buy me?
01:56:23.268,01:56:24.812,About ten minutes.
01:56:49.002,01:56:51.087,I'm awake.
01:56:51.087,01:56:53.256,I saw your taxi drive up.
01:56:55.634,01:56:57.761,Get in here out of the rain.
01:57:04.643,01:57:09.439,"I saw you down at the hub today, so I know you were down there."
01:57:27.708,01:57:29.793,Let me get you a towel.
01:57:41.346,01:57:43.348,They're sleeping.
01:57:46.894,01:57:49.312,"If you come in, I'll make you some coffee."
01:58:02.617,01:58:04.578,It's a nice house.
01:58:04.578,01:58:06.580,"Yeah, we got a nice mortgage too."
01:58:14.421,01:58:17.173,What's your daughter's name?
01:58:17.173,01:58:19.718,Katie.
01:58:19.718,01:58:21.803,Katie.
01:58:25.057,01:58:26.850,She's a beautiful little girl.
01:58:26.850,01:58:29.143,She's a handful.
01:58:42.407,01:58:44.492,Just let me get one thing straight here.
01:58:54.377,01:58:57.631,"We have a pro football team now, but they're in Nashville?"
01:59:03.177,01:59:07.015,"Um, yeah."
01:59:07.015,01:59:08.516,They used to be in Houston.
01:59:08.516,01:59:12.479,"First they were the Oilers, and now they're the Titans."
01:59:12.479,01:59:15.440,The Houston Oilers are the Tennessee Titans?
01:59:15.440,01:59:17.442,Yeah.
01:59:17.442,01:59:19.360,But that's not all.
01:59:19.360,01:59:22.530,They went to the Super Bowl last year.
01:59:22.530,01:59:23.907,And I missed that.
01:59:23.907,01:59:25.784,You would've died.
01:59:25.784,01:59:27.368,They almost won by one yard.
01:59:27.368,01:59:31.039,One lousy yard right at the end.
01:59:31.039,01:59:34.417,"I got whole milk, 2% and nonfat."
01:59:34.417,01:59:36.753,"I don't have any half-and-half, and that's what you like."
01:59:38.046,01:59:40.007,That'll do fine.
01:59:53.020,01:59:55.396,What happened to you becoming a professor?
01:59:57.273,02:00:01.153,You're not Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?
02:00:04.280,02:00:11.997,"When you, um-- When your plane went down, everything just sort of got put on hold."
02:00:14.708,02:00:17.418,"I think about taking it up again, though."
02:00:29.472,02:00:31.599,I came out here to give you this.
02:00:33.226,02:00:35.187,"Oh, my God."
02:00:37.189,02:00:39.191,I'm sorry it doesn't work.
02:00:40.525,02:00:43.611,"And I, uh, I kept the picture."
02:00:44.738,02:00:46.740,It was all faded anyway.
02:00:48.116,02:00:50.994,I want you to have it.
02:00:50.994,02:00:54.164,"That's a family heirloom, and it should stay in your family."
02:01:04.132,02:01:06.968,That's everything I have from when you went down to now.
02:01:09.096,02:01:11.598,They said they never figured out what caused the crash.
02:01:11.598,02:01:15.476,Probably some mislabeled hazardous material caught fire.
02:01:19.522,02:01:22.150,So here's where that ship found you.
02:01:23.484,02:01:26.571,You drifted about 500 miles.
02:01:26.571,02:01:32.410,"This is where your island was, about 600 miles south of the Cook Islands."
02:01:33.787,02:01:36.206,And these are the search grids.
02:01:36.206,02:01:39.167,Ships went back and forth for weeks looking for you.
02:01:48.051,02:01:50.344,I never should've gotten on that plane.
02:01:52.513,02:01:55.142,I never should've gotten out of the car.
02:01:58.895,02:02:00.855,I wanna show you something.
02:02:02.941,02:02:04.901,Come here.
02:02:14.577,02:02:16.621,This is-- This is our car.
02:02:18.790,02:02:20.750,You kept our car.
02:02:22.961,02:02:26.422,"All right, now, this is weird."
02:02:34.681,02:02:36.891,It's a good car.
02:02:36.891,02:02:39.477,Had a lot of memories in this car.
02:02:39.477,02:02:42.063,Two very nice memories.
02:02:42.063,02:02:44.274,"Oh, that trip down to the Gulf, yeah."
02:02:46.651,02:02:48.653,"So, can I drive it?"
02:02:48.653,02:02:50.738,It's your car.
02:02:58.371,02:03:01.749,"That's good, 'cause my-- my taxi's gone."
02:03:07.714,02:03:12.093,Um-- Let me get some stuff out of the back.
02:03:34.657,02:03:37.077,You think you're gonna have more kids?
02:03:37.077,02:03:39.037,I don't know.
02:03:39.037,02:03:42.040,It's kind of confusing right now.
02:03:42.040,02:03:44.709,"Well, you should."
02:03:44.709,02:03:46.794,"I mean, really, you should."
02:03:49.297,02:03:51.258,I would.
02:03:53.343,02:03:55.345,"So, what now?"
02:03:58.306,02:04:00.308,I don't know.
02:04:02.769,02:04:04.812,I really don't know.
02:04:17.367,02:04:19.411,You said you'd be right back.
02:04:24.707,02:04:26.667,I'm so sorry.
02:04:28.502,02:04:30.504,Me too.
02:05:39.282,02:05:41.284,Chuck!
02:05:45.079,02:05:47.832,Chuck!
02:05:47.832,02:05:49.917,Chuck!
02:06:07.101,02:06:09.062,I always knew you were alive.
02:06:09.062,02:06:11.856,I knew it.
02:06:11.856,02:06:16.152,But everybody said I had to stop saying that-- that I had to let you go.
02:06:17.570,02:06:20.573,I love you.
02:06:20.573,02:06:22.534,You're the love of my life.
02:06:24.911,02:06:26.954,"I love you too, Kelly."
02:06:28.622,02:06:30.583,More than you'll ever know.
02:07:30.435,02:07:32.437,Chuck?
02:07:39.235,02:07:42.071,You have to go home.
02:08:30.370,02:08:37.335,"We both had done the math, and-- Kelly added it all up."
02:08:38.836,02:08:40.838,She knew she had to let me go.
02:08:40.838,02:08:47.387,"I added it up, knew that I'd-- I'd lost her."
02:08:49.096,02:08:51.516,'Cause I was never gonna get off that island.
02:08:54.435,02:08:59.065,"I was gonna die there, totally alone."
02:09:05.488,02:09:08.782,"I mean, I was gonna get sick or I was gonna get injured or something."
02:09:12.537,02:09:19.460,"The only choice I had, the only thing I could control..."
02:09:21.588,02:09:24.965,was when and how...
02:09:24.965,02:09:27.051,and where that was gonna happen.
02:09:27.051,02:09:31.723,So...I made a rope.
02:09:34.601,02:09:37.645,And I went up to the summit to hang myself.
02:09:40.981,02:09:43.234,"But I had to test it, you know?"
02:09:43.234,02:09:46.279,Of course.
02:09:48.114,02:09:50.032,And the weight of the log...
02:09:50.032,02:09:53.578,snapped the limb of the tree.
02:09:53.578,02:09:58.249,So I-I-- I couldn't even kill myself the way I wanted to.
02:09:58.249,02:10:01.252,I had power over nothing.
02:10:09.677,02:10:14.014,And that's when this feeling came over me like a warm blanket.
02:10:17.268,02:10:19.437,I knew...
02:10:19.437,02:10:22.022,somehow...
02:10:22.022,02:10:24.233,that I had to stay alive.
02:10:25.943,02:10:27.903,Somehow.
02:10:28.988,02:10:35.911,"I had to keep breathing, even though there was no reason to hope."
02:10:37.997,02:10:41.751,And all my logic said that I would never see this place again.
02:10:46.422,02:10:49.342,So that's what I did.
02:10:49.342,02:10:52.052,I stayed alive.
02:10:52.052,02:10:54.096,I kept breathing.
02:10:56.056,02:11:00.478,"And then one day that logic was proven all wrong, because the tide..."
02:11:02.480,02:11:05.107,"came in, gave me a sail."
02:11:09.821,02:11:11.781,"And now, here I am."
02:11:15.075,02:11:18.078,I'm back...
02:11:18.078,02:11:20.665,"in Memphis, talking to you."
02:11:22.834,02:11:25.294,I have ice in my glass.
02:11:31.967,02:11:34.387,And I've lost her all over again.
02:11:42.019,02:11:44.689,I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.
02:11:49.777,02:11:53.155,But I'm so grateful that she was with me on that island.
02:12:00.204,02:12:02.498,And I know what I have to do now.
02:12:05.334,02:12:07.461,I gotta keep breathing.
02:12:10.089,02:12:12.633,"Because tomorrow, the sun will rise."
02:12:13.801,02:12:16.303,Who knows what the tide could bring?
02:13:22.161,02:13:24.163,Hello!
02:13:28.375,02:13:30.336,Hello!
02:13:38.218,02:13:40.262,FedEx!
02:14:47.830,02:14:49.582,You look lost.
02:14:49.582,02:14:51.959,I do?
02:14:51.959,02:14:54.127,Where are you headed?
02:14:57.798,02:14:59.717,"Well, I was just about to figure that out."
02:15:00.634,02:15:03.012,"Well, that's 83 South."
02:15:03.012,02:15:07.391,And this road here will hook you up with I-40 East.
02:15:07.391,02:15:15.148,"If you turn right, that'll take you to Amarillo, Flagstaff, California."
02:15:16.275,02:15:21.405,"And if you head back that direction, you'll find a whole lotta nothin' all the way to Canada."
02:15:23.365,02:15:25.743,I got it.
02:15:25.743,02:15:28.037,"All right, then."
02:15:30.623,02:15:32.625,"Good luck, cowboy."
02:15:32.625,02:15:35.252,Thank you.
