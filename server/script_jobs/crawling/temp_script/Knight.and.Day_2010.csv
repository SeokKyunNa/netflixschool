00:00:50.718,00:00:54.054,Mid-Continent Airport.
00:00:54.054,00:00:56.974,"Convenient, friendly, affordable."
00:00:56.974,00:00:58.517,Fly with us.
00:01:02.688,00:01:08.027,"Please note, the Kansas Clean Air Act has designated this airport as non-smoking."
00:01:19.287,00:01:22.917,"Your attention, please."
00:01:19.287,00:01:25.126,Baggage claim is located on the east side of the terminal.
00:01:25.126,00:01:32.217,Hotel and ground transportation information boards and public telephones are located opposite the baggage carousels.
00:01:46.732,00:01:52.613,"Ladies and gentlemen, please maintain visual contact with your personal property at all times."
00:01:52.613,00:01:56.867,Please do not leave your baggage or other items unattended.
00:01:56.867,00:01:59.036,Thank you for your cooperation.
00:02:25.437,00:02:27.230,MAN: Excuse me.
00:02:27.230,00:02:29.566,"So, I'm gonna make it onto the earlier flight, right?"
00:02:29.566,00:02:31.234,Are you gonna check that?
00:02:31.234,00:02:33.862,"No, I'm gonna carry it on."
00:02:33.862,00:02:35.280,Here you are.
00:02:56.010,00:02:59.429,"God, excuse me."
00:02:59.429,00:03:01.348,"That bag is wicked heavy, anyhow."
00:03:01.348,00:03:04.559,I was looking at my phone. I hate it when people do that.
00:03:07.729,00:03:12.442,You have a little smudge.
00:03:25.372,00:03:27.248,What are these?
00:03:27.248,00:03:30.044,Those are two barrel carburetors for a Pontiac Tri-Power.
00:03:35.340,00:03:39.094,Those are exhaust tips for a '74 Z-28.
00:03:40.345,00:03:43.140,"I restore old cars, so..."
00:03:44.850,00:03:49.604,Hair-dryer.
00:03:55.694,00:03:58.864,"Oh, my God, I'm so sorry."
00:04:00.741,00:04:02.993,This is getting to be a habit.
00:04:02.993,00:04:04.494,"Yeah, it is."
00:04:06.205,00:04:08.540,Sorry about that.
00:04:08.540,00:04:10.167,Thank you.
00:04:11.919,00:04:13.378,Thank you.
00:04:13.378,00:04:14.755,Boston?
00:04:14.755,00:04:16.090,Yeah.
00:04:16.631,00:04:18.675,Gate 12.
00:04:18.675,00:04:20.761,"Enjoy your flight, Mr. Garcia."
00:04:20.761,00:04:22.096,Hi.
00:04:23.513,00:04:25.724,I'm sorry. You're not on this flight.
00:04:25.724,00:04:28.309,"Well, I just checked in for this one, like, 10 minutes ago."
00:04:28.309,00:04:29.937,That must be some sort of mistake.
00:04:29.937,00:04:32.355,"I'm sorry, the computer shows that we're booked."
00:04:32.355,00:04:33.690,"Listen, Sharry."
00:04:33.690,00:04:35.817,Tomorrow my little sister's getting married.
00:04:35.817,00:04:38.987,I practically raised her.
00:04:38.987,00:04:42.157,"JUNE: Listen, can you help me out for a second?"
00:04:42.157,00:04:46.369,"She's April, I'm June, she's counting on me to march her down the aisle tomorrow."
00:04:46.369,00:04:51.541,"That's very sweet, but the 11:50 will get you there tomorrow morning with plenty of time."
00:04:51.541,00:04:54.461,"Your boarding pass, sir?"
00:04:54.461,00:04:57.047,Sometimes things happen for a reason.
00:04:58.257,00:04:59.925,"Enjoy your flight, Mr. Miller."
00:04:59.925,00:05:02.219,Thank you.
00:05:02.219,00:05:09.268,"WOMAN ON PA: This is the final boarding call for US Midland Air, flight 77 non-stop service to Boston's Logan Airport, now boarding at gate 12."
00:05:09.268,00:05:12.437,"Would all passengers holding a valid boarding pass, please proceed..."
00:05:12.437,00:05:14.439,"FITZGERALD: I should've seen it coming, boss."
00:05:14.439,00:05:16.650,"He went on tilt, he came undone."
00:05:16.650,00:05:19.236,Coming undone in our business means you need a margarita.
00:05:19.236,00:05:22.906,It doesn't mean capping a dozen people in a government lab and blowing it up.
00:05:22.906,00:05:25.450,It doesn't mean stealing an object of critical importance.
00:05:25.450,00:05:28.787,Does he have the Zephyr or not?
00:05:28.787,00:05:30.872,Uh-huh.
00:05:30.872,00:05:33.667,"I don't care what you believe, Fitz."
00:05:33.667,00:05:36.377,I need you to clean your mess up.
00:05:36.377,00:05:38.379,I want the Zephyr.
00:05:38.379,00:05:41.758,We'll have it in hand by the time he lands in Boston.
00:05:41.758,00:05:43.551,Find out who and what she is.
00:05:43.551,00:05:46.096,Should I have the field office pick her up in Wichita?
00:05:46.096,00:05:48.932,Umm-mmm. I got a better idea.
00:05:51.310,00:05:53.061,Miss Havens?
00:05:55.022,00:05:57.691,"MALE ATTENDANT ON PA: I'd like to have your attention, please."
00:05:57.691,00:05:59.400,We apologize for the delay.
00:05:59.400,00:06:03.071,We will be departing Wichita Airport shortly.
00:06:03.071,00:06:04.739,Thanks for your patience.
00:06:08.576,00:06:12.956,"JUNE: I know it's policy or whatever and it's just your job, but it's kind of lame."
00:06:12.956,00:06:14.291,"SHARRY: Again, I apologize."
00:06:14.291,00:06:16.668,Fitz. What did you do?
00:06:20.172,00:06:23.175,It's no wonder these airlines are going out of business.
00:06:23.175,00:06:25.510,ATTENDANT: We have been cleared onto the runway.
00:06:25.510,00:06:26.928,There's nobody on the plane.
00:06:35.145,00:06:38.190,MALE ATTENDANT: The captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.
00:06:38.190,00:06:43.653,Please remain seated until the sign has been turned off and it's safe to move about the cabin.
00:06:43.653,00:06:45.446,"I'm June, by the way."
00:06:45.446,00:06:47.115,I'm Roy Miller.
00:06:47.115,00:06:48.283,Nice to meet you.
00:06:48.283,00:06:49.701,It's very nice to meet you.
00:06:51.370,00:06:52.871,STEWARDESS: Tequila on the rocks?
00:06:52.871,00:06:54.831,"Yeah. Just in time, thanks."
00:06:58.252,00:07:01.255,"So, your sister's getting married tomorrow?"
00:07:01.255,00:07:02.923,Excuse me?
00:07:02.923,00:07:05.384,She's getting married tomorrow.
00:07:05.384,00:07:07.135,"Oh. Yeah, thanks."
00:07:12.140,00:07:15.685,"You know, Roy, I'm a bad liar."
00:07:15.685,00:07:17.979,"I'm sorry, how's that?"
00:07:17.979,00:07:20.607,"April is getting married, but not till Saturday."
00:07:20.607,00:07:21.983,You had me fooled.
00:07:21.983,00:07:24.736,"Well, I do have a fitting tomorrow."
00:07:24.736,00:07:27.488,"So, I do, actually, have to go home."
00:07:35.372,00:07:37.291,I hope this isn't gonna be a rough flight.
00:07:41.461,00:07:42.879,It might be.
00:07:46.007,00:07:48.802,Wichita is a long way to go for a carburetor.
00:07:48.802,00:07:51.346,It's not just any carburetor.
00:07:51.346,00:07:53.765,Oh.
00:07:53.765,00:07:56.184,And Kansas has the best scrap.
00:07:56.184,00:07:57.477,Really?
00:07:57.477,00:08:01.898,"My dad had a garage, and when I was a kid, he bought this chassis."
00:08:01.898,00:08:06.361,"He used to take us to yards, and search for parts, you know?"
00:08:06.361,00:08:16.330,"He died in '98, and now that April's getting married, I just figured, why not finish it up, give it to her sort of as a wedding present?"
00:08:16.330,00:08:20.041,"Kind of like a present from our dad, too, you know?"
00:08:20.041,00:08:21.626,That's nice.
00:08:21.626,00:08:23.586,Yeah.
00:08:33.138,00:08:45.817,"I used to think that someday, when the last part went in, I would just climb into that GTO and start it up."
00:08:47.527,00:08:53.783,"Just drive and drive and drive, and just keep driving until I got to the tip of South America."
00:08:54.575,00:08:58.330,Cape Horn.
00:08:58.330,00:09:00.165,There's beautiful islands down there.
00:09:00.165,00:09:01.791,Yeah?
00:09:01.791,00:09:03.626,Pirate islands.
00:09:07.422,00:09:10.550,"Yeah, someday."
00:09:10.550,00:09:12.511,Dangerous?
00:09:12.511,00:09:15.763,It's really just code for never.
00:09:18.641,00:09:21.769,I think a lot about things I haven't done.
00:09:21.769,00:09:24.523,Dive in the Great Barrier Reef.
00:09:24.523,00:09:26.858,Ride the Orient Express.
00:09:26.858,00:09:32.030,Live on the Amalfi Coast with nothing but a motorcycle and a backpack.
00:09:32.030,00:09:35.033,Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap.
00:09:38.078,00:09:39.413,Where is that?
00:09:39.413,00:09:41.164,South of France.
00:09:42.332,00:09:43.666,Hmm.
00:09:44.751,00:09:47.921,What about you?
00:09:49.506,00:09:52.967,"Well, yours sounds pretty good."
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.014,Wow.
00:10:00.350,00:10:01.809,Thanks.
00:10:01.809,00:10:03.311,It's no problem.
00:10:05.063,00:10:07.190,"I'll just put this up here, if that's all right."
00:10:11.570,00:10:13.738,You know what?
00:10:13.738,00:10:16.824,I'm gonna go back and use the restroom.
00:10:17.992,00:10:20.036,I'll help you.
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.879,"Lots of turbulence, huh?"
00:10:35.176,00:10:37.637,I'll be out in a minute.
00:10:47.981,00:10:51.485,Kiss a stranger on the balcony of the Hotel Du Cap?
00:10:51.485,00:10:53.403,"I mean, what kind of a line is that?"
00:10:57.907,00:11:01.995,"I mean, it's, like, a really good line."
00:11:07.250,00:11:08.793,Ma'am? Ma'am?
00:11:14.715,00:11:17.177,"Did you see his hands, by any chance?"
00:11:17.177,00:11:19.971,"They just, like, snatched that bag right out of the air."
00:11:19.971,00:11:22.098,Lightning-fast reflexes.
00:11:25.226,00:11:26.769,Not cool.
00:11:30.023,00:11:31.441,Okay.
00:11:45.622,00:11:46.956,Huh?
00:11:49.334,00:11:50.918,This will help.
00:12:04.098,00:12:06.518,Ocupado.
00:12:06.518,00:12:09.646,"Enough. It's over, Roy."
00:12:09.646,00:12:12.273,"Yeah, I agree."
00:12:12.273,00:12:14.108,Where's the Zephyr?
00:12:34.170,00:12:37.424,Why is the girl on the plane?
00:12:37.424,00:12:39.384,Why did Fitz put her on the plane?
00:12:42.220,00:12:43.846,"Don't move, Miller."
00:12:55.442,00:12:58.319,So what are you gonna do?
00:12:58.319,00:13:00.821,You're just gonna let this opportunity pass you by?
00:13:00.821,00:13:02.907,"No, of course you're not."
00:13:02.907,00:13:05.410,"You're gonna walk through that door, and get it right."
00:13:05.410,00:13:06.994,"It's not your first rodeo, woman."
00:13:28.975,00:13:30.685,I decided to join you.
00:13:57.545,00:13:59.880,I'm sorry. I...
00:13:59.880,00:14:01.966,"No, no, don't..."
00:14:01.966,00:14:04.761,"It's just, like, the tequila and the altitude and everything."
00:14:04.761,00:14:06.638,There's something I've gotta tell you.
00:14:06.638,00:14:10.141,"What? Oh, my God, you're in a relationship."
00:14:10.141,00:14:12.811,"No, no, no."
00:14:12.811,00:14:15.730,"Okay, I'm all ears."
00:14:18.857,00:14:20.193,Are we landing?
00:14:20.901,00:14:22.862,"No, not yet. Uh..."
00:14:24.280,00:14:25.948,No?
00:14:25.948,00:14:30.495,"Listen, there's no need to panic."
00:14:30.495,00:14:31.954,contained the situation.
00:14:32.913,00:14:35.249,Situation?
00:14:35.249,00:14:38.753,Yeah. We've lost the pilots.
00:14:40.296,00:14:41.548,Where did they go?
00:14:41.548,00:14:43.966,"I mean, they're dead."
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.760,The pilots are dead.
00:14:45.760,00:14:47.345,Shot?
00:14:49.597,00:14:50.890,By who?
00:14:53.267,00:14:56.187,"Well, me."
00:14:56.187,00:14:58.565,"Actually, I shot the first pilot."
00:14:58.565,00:15:06.989,He shot the second pilot accidentally. It's just one of those things.
00:15:23.631,00:15:26.593,"Seriously, this is great!"
00:15:26.593,00:15:29.970,"Really, I'm relieved you are taking this so well."
00:15:35.476,00:15:37.270,Where are you going?
00:15:37.270,00:15:39.856,I'm just gonna go check on things and think about landing.
00:15:39.856,00:15:42.024,Would you mind putting your seatbelt on for me?
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.526,That would be great.
00:15:58.917,00:16:00.752,This is weird.
00:16:15.767,00:16:18.185,MILLER: Mayday. Mayday.
00:16:18.185,00:16:21.105,What's happening?
00:16:21.105,00:16:23.274,Come on in. Sit down.
00:16:23.274,00:16:26.026,Everybody's dead in here.
00:16:26.026,00:16:27.987,"Oh, my God!"
00:16:27.987,00:16:29.572,Are we going down?
00:16:29.572,00:16:31.783,"No, June, it's just a rapid descent."
00:16:31.783,00:16:34.118,"MAN ON RADIO: Please state your emergency, Midland 77."
00:16:34.118,00:16:36.370,"I'm sorry, I think I've heard enough of this guy."
00:16:36.370,00:16:38.623,Are you a pilot?
00:16:38.623,00:16:40.291,The shoulder straps.
00:16:40.291,00:16:43.336,"You can put those over, and it clicks in right down there."
00:16:43.336,00:16:46.005,"You wanna click it right there, that's it."
00:16:46.005,00:16:49.091,"Okay, I got it, I got it. Okay..."
00:16:49.091,00:16:50.426,"Gear down, showdown."
00:16:52.303,00:16:54.681,Why can't we just land in an airport?
00:16:54.681,00:16:57.224,"No, no, that wouldn't be a good idea."
00:16:57.224,00:16:58.434,They'll be waiting for us.
00:16:58.434,00:16:59.936,What do you mean?
00:16:59.936,00:17:01.187,Who?
00:17:01.187,00:17:02.897,"I think the less you know, the better."
00:17:02.897,00:17:05.065,What?
00:17:05.065,00:17:07.443,"MILLER: Okay, we're gonna touch down here."
00:17:07.443,00:17:09.821,"JUNE: Oh, God. Oh, my God!"
00:17:15.075,00:17:16.870,That's a truck.
00:17:16.870,00:17:19.747,That's a truck!
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.085,"JUNE: Oh, my God!"
00:17:30.216,00:17:32.844,That's a curve.
00:17:40.184,00:17:41.477,"Oh, my God!"
00:17:43.187,00:17:44.689,"Oh, God!"
00:18:00.705,00:18:02.081,"Okay, this is good."
00:18:02.081,00:18:03.666,JUNE: What's good?
00:18:07.045,00:18:08.922,Take a sip of that.
00:18:08.922,00:18:10.256,It'll take the edge off.
00:18:16.763,00:18:18.347,Are you shot?
00:18:18.347,00:18:19.599,"Yeah, how about that?"
00:18:19.599,00:18:22.769,It's just a scrape.
00:18:24.729,00:18:29.650,"June, we have to discuss what's gonna happen next."
00:18:29.650,00:18:32.612,You need to go to the hospital.
00:18:32.612,00:18:36.407,Some people are gonna come looking for you now.
00:18:36.407,00:18:37.825,"You know, I feel a little weird."
00:18:37.825,00:18:41.370,"Yeah, that'll pass once you fall asleep, which should be in a couple of minutes."
00:18:41.370,00:18:43.122,What?
00:18:43.122,00:18:44.540,Did you drug me?
00:18:44.540,00:18:45.792,Yes.
00:18:45.792,00:18:46.960,You drugged me.
00:18:46.960,00:18:48.294,"Yeah, it's for your own good."
00:18:48.294,00:18:50.379,"Now, look."
00:18:48.294,00:18:53.507,"These bad people who are going to come and see you, they're gonna ask you about me. Okay?"
00:18:53.507,00:18:55.802,And you need to tell them you don't know me.
00:18:55.802,00:18:57.553,June? June?
00:18:57.553,00:18:59.680,You need to tell them you don't remember anything.
00:18:59.680,00:19:02.558,And you need to avoid getting in any vehicle with them at all costs.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.435,"Okay, who are them?"
00:19:04.435,00:19:06.145,"Well, they're serious people, June."
00:19:06.145,00:19:10.316,"They'll probably identify themselves as federal agents, and they'll DIP you."
00:19:10.316,00:19:12.568,Dip me? In what?
00:19:12.568,00:19:15.362,Dis-Information Protocol.
00:19:15.362,00:19:18.783,"About how I'm mentally unstable, paranoid."
00:19:20.076,00:19:23.913,"How I'm violent and dangerous, and it'll all sound very convincing."
00:19:23.913,00:19:25.456,I'm already convinced.
00:19:25.456,00:19:28.918,There's a few common DIP keywords to listen for.
00:19:28.918,00:19:32.505,Reassuring words.
00:19:32.505,00:19:35.215,"If they say these words, particularly with repetition..."
00:19:35.215,00:19:36.592,Okay.
00:19:36.592,00:19:38.469,...it means they're going to kill you.
00:19:38.469,00:19:40.179,"Oh, God!"
00:19:40.179,00:19:42.598,Or intern you somewhere offshore for a very long time.
00:19:42.598,00:19:44.308,Okay?
00:19:44.308,00:19:46.435,"Now, stay with me."
00:19:46.435,00:19:50.564,"If they tell me I'm safe, they're gonna kill me."
00:19:50.564,00:19:51.774,Don't get in what?
00:19:51.774,00:19:53.484,Vehicles.
00:19:53.484,00:19:55.194,Any vehicles.
00:19:55.194,00:19:56.696,Just run.
00:19:56.696,00:19:58.031,Run.
00:19:58.031,00:19:59.365,And if they ask you about me...
00:19:59.365,00:20:00.700,Uh-huh.
00:20:02.076,00:20:06.246,I don't know you.
00:20:06.246,00:20:08.166,"Who are you, Roy?"
00:20:51.250,00:20:56.130,"WOMAN ON TV: ...a mixing of rain and snow, good for ski country, but probably..."
00:20:56.130,00:20:58.007,"MAN ON TV: Thanks, Andrea."
00:20:58.007,00:20:59.967,"Now, back to our top news story of the morning."
00:20:59.967,00:21:02.845,"Here's Bradley Moss, with an on-the-scene report."
00:21:02.845,00:21:10.561,"MOSS: According to FAA sources, at approximately 7:30 last night, all contact was lost with a Boston-bound commuter jet from Wichita."
00:21:10.561,00:21:16.525,The plane was passing through turbulence and may have met up with wind shear or a lightning storm.
00:21:16.525,00:21:21.363,"Now, this is all conjecture at this point, as all that's left is a crater in an Indiana cornfield."
00:21:21.363,00:21:22.782,Coming!
00:21:29.496,00:21:31.165,Rodney?
00:21:31.165,00:21:32.666,Oh! Thank God.
00:21:32.666,00:21:34.252,I wanted to make sure you were okay.
00:21:34.252,00:21:35.586,"Yeah, why?"
00:21:35.586,00:21:37.255,"You were on that flight from Kansas, right?"
00:21:37.255,00:21:39.215,Yeah.
00:21:39.215,00:21:41.425,What news?
00:21:41.425,00:21:43.261,"Anyway, you're alive."
00:21:43.261,00:21:44.804,"I'm alive, yeah."
00:21:44.804,00:21:49.349,"Sure, that's cool."
00:21:49.349,00:21:55.148,"I told myself that if I found you alive, that I was gonna ask you to dinner."
00:21:55.148,00:21:57.066,"How about I call you later, okay?"
00:22:04.490,00:22:08.327,JUNE: It's just another day.
00:22:12.873,00:22:14.625,She's moving.
00:22:15.751,00:22:17.086,APRIL: Wow!
00:22:17.086,00:22:20.047,And gotta love the boots.
00:22:20.047,00:22:23.217,"Yeah, you know."
00:22:23.217,00:22:25.427,I promise I'll wear heels on the day.
00:22:25.427,00:22:27.471,Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?
00:22:30.266,00:22:34.312,"So, this weekend, I was thinking about Dad's GTO."
00:22:34.312,00:22:35.479,Really?
00:22:35.479,00:22:37.523,"Yeah, it's just sitting there."
00:22:37.523,00:22:42.360,And I was wondering how you would feel about maybe selling it.
00:22:42.360,00:22:44.362,You wanna sell Dad's GTO?
00:22:44.362,00:22:47.407,"Ben and I, we really want our own place."
00:22:47.407,00:22:48.659,Excuse me?
00:22:48.659,00:22:50.203,Excuse me.
00:22:50.203,00:22:52.663,Anyone here belong to that blue truck parked outside?
00:22:52.663,00:22:53.873,"Yeah, why?"
00:22:53.873,00:22:55.499,You're about to get a ticket.
00:22:55.499,00:22:57.751,Thought I put enough quarters in there.
00:22:57.751,00:22:59.962,I hate getting tickets.
00:22:59.962,00:23:01.505,Ooh! Excuse me.
00:23:07.511,00:23:08.846,"Please step inside, miss."
00:23:10.264,00:23:13.184,Uh... Let me just go grab a few things.
00:23:13.184,00:23:16.229,"Miss Havens, good afternoon."
00:23:16.229,00:23:18.396,Will you join us inside the car for a moment?
00:23:20.316,00:23:22.651,We know you were on the flight with him last night.
00:23:22.651,00:23:23.944,The one that crashed.
00:23:27.990,00:23:29.742,Who are you again?
00:23:29.742,00:23:32.870,FBI. You do know Mr. Miller.
00:23:33.453,00:23:34.872,"No, I don't."
00:23:40.794,00:23:45.299,"Well, we chatted a little bit before security, but..."
00:23:45.299,00:23:47.676,I see.
00:23:45.299,00:23:51.638,"And once you were on the flight, what happened then?"
00:23:51.638,00:23:53.182,Is this funny to you?
00:23:53.182,00:23:55.475,"He's dangerous, Miss Havens, and out of control."
00:23:57.853,00:24:01.815,He said that you'd say he was crazy.
00:24:01.815,00:24:04.402,"So, you did talk to him."
00:24:04.402,00:24:07.113,"No. No, not you, specifically."
00:24:07.113,00:24:08.989,"About whom, then?"
00:24:10.116,00:24:11.533,Simon Feck?
00:24:11.533,00:24:14.328,I don't know who that is.
00:24:14.328,00:24:20.126,"Look, this is getting really twisted around, and I think I should probably call a lawyer."
00:24:21.001,00:24:22.336,Mmm.
00:24:26.966,00:24:31.345,"We're gonna take you to a secure location, Miss Havens, until Miller is contained."
00:24:31.345,00:24:32.679,Someplace safe.
00:24:34.890,00:24:37.017,With you?
00:24:49.029,00:24:51.407,JUNE: You wanna tell me where we're going?
00:24:51.407,00:24:53.951,Fellas?
00:24:54.743,00:24:56.620,Excuse me?
00:24:56.620,00:24:57.788,You're safe with us.
00:24:57.788,00:24:59.457,I wanna know where we're going.
00:24:59.457,00:25:02.876,Just a shortcut till the situation is stabilized.
00:25:02.876,00:25:04.711,We'll keep you safe.
00:25:04.711,00:25:08.341,You said that already.
00:25:09.925,00:25:11.469,AGENT: What is Jackson doing?
00:25:15.513,00:25:19.143,Shooter! Shooter!
00:25:19.143,00:25:21.020,The dot's on your back!
00:25:23.814,00:25:25.316,"Follow me, now!"
00:25:25.316,00:25:27.443,Are you insane?
00:25:38.871,00:25:40.206,Get your foot off...
00:25:55.971,00:25:58.140,"Oh, my God!"
00:25:58.140,00:26:00.100,I can't see!
00:26:00.100,00:26:01.394,I can't see!
00:26:01.394,00:26:03.062,Open the door.
00:26:03.062,00:26:05.356,I can't get his foot off the gas.
00:26:05.356,00:26:08.108,"Open the door, June."
00:26:09.651,00:26:11.070,One second.
00:26:13.155,00:26:14.448,"Oh, my God!"
00:26:25.167,00:26:27.169,WOMAN: I totally know what you're talking about.
00:26:27.169,00:26:30.714,"It's so boring, I can't even stand it. Totally."
00:26:30.714,00:26:32.049,Thank you.
00:26:38.347,00:26:39.932,Who are you?
00:26:41.641,00:26:43.643,"Oh, God!"
00:26:43.643,00:26:44.978,What are you doing?
00:26:50.776,00:26:52.778,"Hi, June."
00:26:52.778,00:26:54.238,"Please unlock the door, June."
00:26:56.490,00:26:59.076,Unlock the door.
00:26:59.076,00:27:01.078,I can't let go!
00:27:10.754,00:27:13.424,"June, door!"
00:27:32.401,00:27:34.778,Just pull over!
00:27:45.747,00:27:49.751,Come on. Come on. Come on.
00:27:49.751,00:27:52.087,Right over here.
00:27:52.087,00:27:54.798,"Here, hold this."
00:27:54.798,00:27:56.425,Check this out.
00:27:57.217,00:27:58.385,Nice.
00:27:58.385,00:28:00.554,These guys are loaded for bear.
00:28:00.554,00:28:02.014,"You're doing well, June."
00:28:02.014,00:28:04.933,Excellent driving.
00:28:04.933,00:28:06.268,You're a natural.
00:28:07.269,00:28:08.854,That's a beautiful dress.
00:28:08.854,00:28:10.648,Is that for April's wedding?
00:28:10.648,00:28:12.149,Saturday?
00:28:12.149,00:28:13.691,"Yeah, that will be nice."
00:28:18.030,00:28:21.699,"shooting people, okay?"
00:28:21.699,00:28:23.118,Just stop shooting people.
00:28:23.118,00:28:24.411,I understand.
00:28:24.411,00:28:26.664,You're in shock.
00:28:26.664,00:28:31.585,How about you stay here while I go have a word with the guys in the tunnel.
00:28:31.585,00:28:33.128,Okay?
00:28:33.128,00:28:34.921,Okay?
00:28:34.921,00:28:37.715,"Actually, I'm just gonna go shoot them."
00:28:40.177,00:28:42.513,"By the way, your timing when you opened that door..."
00:28:42.513,00:28:44.723,Okay.
00:28:44.723,00:28:46.350,"You saved us, I hope you know that."
00:28:46.350,00:28:48.310,You saved us.
00:29:15.546,00:29:17.172,Hey! Hey!
00:29:23.512,00:29:24.846,"Hey, wait!"
00:29:30.561,00:29:32.187,Wait! Wait! Wait!
00:30:05.679,00:30:07.431,"Oh, no."
00:30:07.431,00:30:09.266,"Excuse me, sorry."
00:30:10.850,00:30:12.185,There you are.
00:30:13.228,00:30:14.647,MILLER: June?
00:30:15.439,00:30:17.023,June?
00:30:25.824,00:30:27.159,Rodney?
00:30:27.159,00:30:29.077,MAN: He's in the gym.
00:30:30.412,00:30:32.665,Hey!
00:30:32.665,00:30:34.458,What are you doing here?
00:30:34.458,00:30:37.377,Whoa! That's a...
00:30:37.377,00:30:38.587,That's a dress.
00:30:38.587,00:30:39.755,Thanks.
00:30:39.755,00:30:41.757,Everything all right?
00:30:41.757,00:30:43.467,"No, it's..."
00:30:44.760,00:30:46.303,It's complicated.
00:30:46.303,00:30:48.764,You know what?
00:30:48.764,00:30:50.140,You wanna talk?
00:30:50.140,00:30:51.975,Maybe over some pie?
00:30:54.019,00:30:55.479,My point is...
00:30:55.479,00:30:58.732,"My point is, that plane crash made me think about our break-up."
00:30:58.732,00:31:00.484,"You know, this bulb went off, bing!"
00:31:00.484,00:31:02.902,"Rodney, why are you giving up?"
00:31:02.902,00:31:05.405,Getting back at her because she didn't want the ring.
00:31:05.405,00:31:09.409,"So June didn't want to be engaged right now, and that freaks your mom out. Big deal!"
00:31:09.409,00:31:12.496,"What about all the things you and June wanted to do together, huh?"
00:31:12.496,00:31:14.581,"Our list, you know?"
00:31:14.581,00:31:17.710,Like camping in Vermont with my brother and Sheila in their new Winnie.
00:31:17.710,00:31:19.919,"Tickets to Blue Man Group, the battlegrounds tour."
00:31:19.919,00:31:22.297,I wanna talk about the plane crash. Okay?
00:31:24.341,00:31:25.592,"Sure, what about it?"
00:31:25.592,00:31:27.553,I was on it.
00:31:27.553,00:31:28.804,"I mean, I was in it."
00:31:28.804,00:31:30.514,So you were in the plane crash?
00:31:30.514,00:31:37.396,"I wasn't supposed to be on that plane, but I was on it, and there was this guy who was some sort of secret agent or something, and he..."
00:31:38.605,00:31:41.775,He killed everybody on board.
00:31:41.775,00:31:45.320,And then he landed the plane.
00:31:41.775,00:31:46.905,"Next thing you know, I wake up, I'm in my room."
00:31:46.905,00:31:48.240,I have no idea how I got there.
00:31:48.240,00:31:49.867,He must've drugged me or something.
00:31:49.867,00:31:53.203,"Then I go to April's fitting, because I have to wear this ridiculous dress."
00:31:53.203,00:31:55.997,"These other guys, these other agents come, they snatch me up."
00:31:55.997,00:31:58.417,"Next thing you know, I'm in Grand Theft Auto on the I-93."
00:31:58.417,00:31:59.752,Why are you touching my hand?
00:31:59.752,00:32:01.169,Because I'm here for you.
00:32:01.169,00:32:03.213,"Jeez, you are so stressed out!"
00:32:03.213,00:32:04.840,And I get it.
00:32:04.840,00:32:07.133,I completely understand.
00:32:07.133,00:32:08.844,"Wow, June."
00:32:08.844,00:32:11.430,Your little sister's getting married...
00:32:11.430,00:32:13.932,...and that is stressful.
00:32:13.932,00:32:16.017,You didn't even listen to what I was talking about.
00:32:16.017,00:32:18.854,"No, I did. Look, I would probably be the same way in that situation."
00:32:18.854,00:32:21.690,What can I do to help?
00:32:21.690,00:32:23.275,"No, no, no. Okay."
00:32:23.275,00:32:24.777,"Oh, Christ."
00:32:25.944,00:32:28.113,"Hi, June."
00:32:28.113,00:32:30.866,"I'm sorry if I'm interrupting anything, but..."
00:32:30.866,00:32:32.200,I'm Roy Miller.
00:32:33.118,00:32:34.369,Rodney Burris.
00:32:34.369,00:32:37.915,"Rodney, hi."
00:32:37.915,00:32:45.798,"We're running out of time, and maybe I didn't make it clear enough, but we're gonna have to stick together for a little bit, because of our..."
00:32:45.798,00:32:48.467,"You know, our situation."
00:32:48.467,00:32:51.010,"In case you didn't notice, Rodney is a fireman, okay?"
00:32:51.010,00:32:54.473,So he's perfectly capable of handling any situation that comes up.
00:32:54.473,00:32:56.391,"Thank you very much, you can leave us alone."
00:32:56.391,00:32:57.935,I have no doubt.
00:32:57.935,00:33:01.271,"Ever since I was a little kid, I have great respect for firemen."
00:33:01.271,00:33:03.022,I appreciate it.
00:33:01.271,00:33:05.567,"Fact of the matter is, I don't think you guys get paid enough."
00:33:05.567,00:33:06.902,You're in Engine 10.
00:33:07.611,00:33:09.070,"Yeah, Engine 10."
00:33:09.070,00:33:11.156,Yeah. Have you taken your lieutenant's exam yet?
00:33:11.156,00:33:12.449,I'm working on it.
00:33:12.449,00:33:13.992,Yeah? How's that going?
00:33:13.992,00:33:15.452,It's a bitch.
00:33:15.452,00:33:17.370,"Did you ever do a tour in that hall, what is it?"
00:33:17.370,00:33:19.832,"Oh, Grove Hall, that's where the action is."
00:33:19.832,00:33:21.625,It's the fastest way up the ladder.
00:33:21.625,00:33:23.710,Rodney!
00:33:24.544,00:33:26.588,I often thought I...
00:33:28.924,00:33:32.093,I should have been a fireman.
00:33:32.093,00:33:34.930,this is the guy.
00:33:35.722,00:33:37.056,What?
00:33:38.266,00:33:39.518,This is the guy.
00:33:39.518,00:33:41.520,What? This is the guy?
00:33:41.520,00:33:43.271,"I'm sorry, who are you?"
00:33:45.482,00:33:47.609,I'm the guy?
00:33:47.609,00:33:49.736,I'm the guy.
00:33:49.736,00:33:51.321,This is the guy.
00:33:51.321,00:33:52.948,I'm the guy.
00:33:52.948,00:33:55.909,I'm a guy.
00:33:55.909,00:33:57.911,"Rodney, whatever happens..."
00:33:57.911,00:34:00.580,"Please, for your own safety..."
00:33:57.911,00:34:02.749,"Rodney, whatever happens, you should know..."
00:34:02.749,00:34:04.167,What are you talking about?
00:34:05.502,00:34:06.712,JUNE: Wait!
00:34:06.712,00:34:09.130,Everybody!
00:34:09.130,00:34:11.675,"Get down, down, down!"
00:34:11.675,00:34:14.553,"Rodney, get down, or I will blow her head off."
00:34:14.553,00:34:16.847,I'll blow her head off.
00:34:16.847,00:34:18.473,What did I say?
00:34:18.473,00:34:19.933,"Rodney, what did I say?"
00:34:19.933,00:34:21.852,"Just calm down, buddy."
00:34:24.270,00:34:26.982,"Sorry, I thought you were making a move."
00:34:26.982,00:34:29.860,"Sorry. It's all right, I thought he was making a move."
00:34:29.860,00:34:32.571,Making a little pie.
00:34:32.571,00:34:35.156,"Everybody gets pies, okay?"
00:34:35.156,00:34:38.577,"Weakens the legs, people."
00:34:38.577,00:34:41.371,"No one follows us, or I kill myself and then her."
00:34:50.255,00:34:52.507,Get in the car.
00:34:52.507,00:34:53.842,Watch your head.
00:34:56.595,00:34:59.138,We're at 560 Harris.
00:34:59.138,00:35:01.433,Rodney! Rodney!
00:35:08.607,00:35:10.483,"Oh, my God!"
00:35:11.651,00:35:13.236,It's okay.
00:35:13.236,00:35:14.947,"Okay. Look at me, it's okay."
00:35:14.947,00:35:18.992,"I shot you through and through. No bone, nowhere near the femoral artery, okay? All right?"
00:35:18.992,00:35:21.870,This is gonna be better for you than Grove Hall.
00:35:21.870,00:35:23.914,Okay? You good?
00:35:23.914,00:35:25.248,Good?
00:35:25.248,00:35:27.125,Good?
00:35:46.311,00:35:50.189,"There were four security cameras in that restaurant, June."
00:35:50.189,00:35:52.233,Now there is proof you're my hostage.
00:35:52.233,00:35:54.444,"So we've cleared your name, with the locals, at least."
00:35:54.444,00:35:58.239,You know? It's a start.
00:35:58.239,00:36:00.199,You shot Rodney!
00:36:00.199,00:36:01.576,"Yeah, I did."
00:36:01.576,00:36:04.621,But I asked him to stay in the booth.
00:36:04.621,00:36:06.372,You shot Rodney!
00:36:06.372,00:36:08.625,It might be the best thing that ever happened to him.
00:36:08.625,00:36:11.837,"Yeah, right, because we all should get shot every now and then!"
00:36:11.837,00:36:15.007,"Rodney... Rodney is a good guy, June."
00:36:15.007,00:36:17.550,But not really right for you.
00:36:17.550,00:36:20.428,"I mean, you know, in my opinion."
00:36:20.428,00:36:23.682,"Took a bullet, he's gonna be a hero."
00:36:23.682,00:36:25.684,Stop the car.
00:36:25.684,00:36:28.269,Stop the car.
00:36:28.269,00:36:30.522,"June, I understand you want off the carousel."
00:36:30.522,00:36:32.941,"I do, I wanna get off the carousel."
00:36:32.941,00:36:34.734,"Can you stop the car, please? Right now!"
00:36:34.734,00:36:39.572,"I'm not one of those I told you so kind of guys, but I did warn you to stay off the plane last night."
00:36:40.448,00:36:42.117,When?
00:36:42.117,00:36:45.203,"Well, when I said, Sometimes things happen for a reason."
00:36:47.122,00:36:51.001,That's not a warning.
00:36:51.001,00:36:54.587,That's like a needlepoint expression or a bumper sticker.
00:36:54.587,00:36:59.051,"Next time, try, June, if you get on this plane, you will fucking die!"
00:36:59.051,00:37:03.555,"Huh? You know, Roy, maybe they meant it when they said that I would be safe."
00:37:03.555,00:37:04.806,"You really mean that, June?"
00:37:04.806,00:37:06.141,Yeah!
00:37:07.266,00:37:09.728,Did you feel safe with them?
00:37:09.728,00:37:12.022,Safer than I do now!
00:37:12.022,00:37:15.108,"Okay, okay."
00:37:39.424,00:37:45.555,"Just so you understand, right now, out there, on your own, your life expectancy is like here."
00:37:45.555,00:37:48.225,"With me, it's here."
00:37:48.225,00:37:52.020,"With me, without me."
00:37:52.020,00:37:53.813,So...
00:37:53.813,00:37:55.648,I wouldn't advise going home.
00:37:55.648,00:37:57.234,"But, you know, it's up to you."
00:37:57.234,00:37:59.611,"So right now I need another car, keep moving."
00:37:59.611,00:38:01.029,Someone else is depending on me.
00:38:01.029,00:38:02.822,Someone whose life is in danger.
00:38:02.822,00:38:06.492,Someone who trusts me.
00:38:02.822,00:38:08.036,"Every second I waste chasing you, I'm letting him down."
00:38:54.874,00:38:58.044,"WOMAN ON TV: Rodney, why did you make this brave call to leap into action?"
00:38:58.044,00:39:00.213,"RODNEY ON TV: Well, I didn't think."
00:39:00.213,00:39:02.882,"I just did what any man would do in that situation, you know?"
00:39:02.882,00:39:04.342,I leapt into action.
00:39:04.342,00:39:05.969,"Like you said, it's really the job."
00:39:05.969,00:39:07.095,You should be so proud.
00:39:07.095,00:39:08.429,Thanks.
00:39:08.429,00:39:09.848,It really didn't even hurt.
00:39:09.848,00:39:11.266,It was kind of like a bee sting.
00:39:11.266,00:39:13.392,What a brave firefighter.
00:39:13.392,00:39:16.688,"The doctors tell me Rodney is going to be okay, just a flesh wound."
00:39:16.688,00:39:21.276,A true blue Boston hero.
00:39:35.373,00:39:37.375,This is what it's all about.
00:39:37.375,00:39:40.962,"That, right there, is what everybody wants."
00:39:43.631,00:39:44.966,A Burger King toy?
00:39:46.926,00:39:48.261,Open it up.
00:39:56.644,00:39:58.396,It's warm.
00:39:58.396,00:39:59.772,A battery.
00:40:00.523,00:40:02.525,A battery?
00:40:02.525,00:40:06.029,It's code-named Zephyr.
00:40:07.322,00:40:10.325,It's high output.
00:40:10.325,00:40:12.535,"What do you mean, never?"
00:40:12.535,00:40:17.249,That little thing there is the first perpetual energy source since the sun.
00:40:17.249,00:40:19.876,"So, what, your flashlight never runs out of juice?"
00:40:21.419,00:40:23.963,"It can power a lot more than a flashlight, June."
00:40:23.963,00:40:26.299,Really?
00:40:26.299,00:40:29.427,Small city.
00:40:29.427,00:40:30.762,Large submarine.
00:40:32.680,00:40:34.015,It's big.
00:40:35.392,00:40:39.729,The guy who invented it is barely out of high school.
00:40:39.729,00:40:42.190,Simon Feck.
00:40:42.190,00:40:46.611,"I was assigned with another agent to watch him at a facility, a lab in Wichita."
00:40:46.611,00:40:50.823,"And the other guy, the agent, is the guy who picked you up this morning."
00:40:51.824,00:40:55.036,Fitzgerald.
00:40:55.036,00:41:01.542,"A couple of weeks ago, I found out he was going to sell the battery and kill Simon."
00:41:03.669,00:41:09.259,"So I got Simon out of there, put him someplace safe and went back for the battery."
00:41:09.259,00:41:13.846,Fitz set me up.
00:41:18.726,00:41:21.438,That's when I met you.
00:41:29.570,00:41:31.239,So...
00:41:33.658,00:41:36.911,"So, what's next?"
00:41:36.911,00:41:42.417,"I think we get some rest, pick up Simon, and get you back for your sister's wedding."
00:41:45.044,00:41:48.465,"I'm pretty good at what I do, June."
00:41:48.465,00:41:51.592,"And tonight, we're safe."
00:41:52.469,00:41:54.095,Scout's honor.
00:41:55.763,00:41:57.474,Safe and secure?
00:42:05.190,00:42:07.108,"Good night, Roy."
00:42:11.070,00:42:13.072,Were you really a Boy Scout?
00:42:15.074,00:42:17.494,Eagle Scout.
00:42:19.162,00:42:21.998,I was a Brownie.
00:42:21.998,00:42:23.458,That's cool.
00:42:27.504,00:42:29.506,"Good night, Roy."
00:42:46.481,00:42:48.233,MILLER: Pies for everybody.
00:42:48.233,00:42:50.360,"Everybody gets pies, okay?"
00:42:52.611,00:42:56.074,"So, what do you think?"
00:42:56.074,00:42:59.827,We're looking at a pawn.
00:42:59.827,00:43:03.248,"She owns a garage, no passport, gone nowhere, been nowhere."
00:43:03.248,00:43:05.166,She's a nobody.
00:43:05.166,00:43:08.961,"You've been two steps behind since this began, Fitz."
00:43:08.961,00:43:11.172,Are you sure someone is not taking you to school?
00:43:11.172,00:43:12.757,Clean this shit up.
00:43:32.318,00:43:34.862,This is a safe house?
00:43:36.072,00:43:37.740,Simon!
00:43:44.872,00:43:47.083,Simon?
00:43:47.083,00:43:52.589,you've got to know Stay close.
00:43:54.840,00:43:59.429,"Hey, Simon, this is no time to play."
00:44:02.890,00:44:15.361,They're watching you What is all this?
00:44:15.361,00:44:18.072,Simon. It's what he does.
00:44:19.782,00:44:22.201,"I'm late, and he's gone."
00:44:24.787,00:45:01.324,"You play with love Baby, that ain't enough girl, I'm gonna know or letting me go you're hurting inside escape my eyes They're watching you every move, baby They're watching you Mmm-hmm."
00:45:02.200,00:45:03.535,Mmm!
00:45:23.012,00:45:36.568,"a front for me but on your side, you see Hmm. Made in Austria."
00:45:51.583,00:45:54.377,Who are these people?
00:45:54.377,00:45:57.505,"No, it's other guys."
00:45:57.505,00:45:59.507,Other bad guys?
00:45:59.507,00:46:02.218,Worse guys.
00:46:03.428,00:46:05.221,Worse guys?
00:46:05.221,00:46:08.725,"Now, I need you to listen carefully."
00:46:08.725,00:46:13.062,"On three, I'm gonna lay down cover, then we're gonna run to those shelves over there."
00:46:13.062,00:46:14.272,Okay.
00:46:14.272,00:46:15.523,Okay?
00:46:15.523,00:46:16.857,You ready?
00:46:16.857,00:46:18.150,One...
00:46:22.405,00:46:24.616,"Oh, my God!"
00:46:24.616,00:46:26.825,Sorry. I panicked.
00:46:28.035,00:46:29.412,What number would you like?
00:46:29.412,00:46:31.205,"Let's just stick with three, it's good."
00:46:31.205,00:46:33.249,Okay. One... Two...
00:46:33.249,00:46:34.584,Three.
00:46:46.554,00:46:49.890,These guys are fancy.
00:46:49.890,00:46:52.226,Could be Antonio Quintana's men.
00:46:52.226,00:46:55.271,He's a Spanish arms dealer.
00:46:55.271,00:46:58.149,He also wants the battery.
00:46:58.149,00:46:59.442,Ready?
00:46:59.442,00:47:01.152,Let's move.
00:47:03.154,00:47:06.240,June. June!
00:47:06.240,00:47:09.619,How the hell are we gonna get out of here?
00:47:09.619,00:47:11.120,And where the hell is Simon?
00:47:11.120,00:47:12.829,"I don't know yet, but he left a message."
00:47:12.829,00:47:14.666,A message?
00:47:21.631,00:47:24.925,What I need you to do right now is wait here.
00:47:24.925,00:47:26.969,What?
00:47:26.969,00:47:28.680,I can't wait here!
00:47:28.680,00:47:30.014,Wait! Roy!
00:47:30.598,00:47:31.890,Just take this.
00:47:46.364,00:47:48.157,Shit.
00:47:50.201,00:47:51.868,June?
00:47:51.868,00:47:55.080,June! June! June! June!
00:47:56.374,00:47:59.126,June! June! June! June!
00:48:01.962,00:48:03.130,June!
00:48:03.130,00:48:04.674,Please stop saying my name.
00:48:04.674,00:48:06.801,"You keep saying my name, it's freaking me out."
00:48:07.844,00:48:11.222,Okay. I understand.
00:48:12.640,00:48:14.266,Drink this.
00:48:14.266,00:48:16.602,Brotine-zero.
00:48:16.602,00:48:18.187,"Oh, yeah."
00:48:19.438,00:48:20.773,Where's yours?
00:48:24.943,00:48:26.738,"Oh, shit."
00:48:26.738,00:48:28.113,I'm sorry.
00:48:28.113,00:48:29.741,They're coming.
00:48:50.344,00:49:00.062,"I know this looks bad, but we'll be out of here in a couple of minutes."
00:49:05.651,00:49:08.487,"We gotta go, June."
00:49:19.206,00:49:20.708,We've been hit!
00:49:20.708,00:49:23.210,But it's okay!
00:49:23.210,00:49:25.713,"We get through this, we're home free!"
00:49:25.713,00:49:28.758,"Ready, set, go!"
00:49:39.976,00:49:42.229,We're almost there.
00:50:27.733,00:50:29.109,"Hey, there, sleepy head."
00:50:38.995,00:50:40.788,How long have I been out?
00:50:40.788,00:50:42.665,Eighteen hours.
00:50:44.583,00:50:46.335,Where am I?
00:50:47.336,00:50:49.213,My place.
00:50:50.715,00:50:52.008,We're off-grid.
00:50:53.133,00:50:55.135,No one's ever found me here.
00:50:55.135,00:50:56.804,Shame we can't stay longer.
00:50:56.804,00:50:58.430,We got a rendezvous with Simon.
00:50:58.430,00:51:01.225,He's fine.
00:51:02.100,00:51:04.020,He's crazy about trains.
00:51:04.020,00:51:06.564,He used the passport I gave him and went to Austria.
00:51:06.564,00:51:08.733,"You drugged me again, Roy."
00:51:08.733,00:51:10.776,Yeah.
00:51:10.776,00:51:13.612,You can't do that.
00:51:13.612,00:51:16.574,"Well, you weren't coping well."
00:51:16.574,00:51:20.452,"I'm not sure, if you were awake, if they would've even let you live."
00:51:21.328,00:51:23.664,What am I wearing?
00:51:23.664,00:51:25.081,Huh?
00:51:26.667,00:51:29.294,A bikini.
00:51:29.294,00:51:31.338,How did I get in the bikini?
00:51:35.091,00:51:43.517,"June, I've been trained to dismantle a bomb in the pitch black with nothing but a safety pin and a Junior Mint."
00:51:43.517,00:51:49.105,I think I can get you in and out of some clothes without looking.
00:51:52.902,00:51:55.613,"I'm not saying that's what I did, but..."
00:51:55.613,00:51:59.241,Okay. Sorry. Reflex.
00:51:59.241,00:52:02.202,I deserved that.
00:52:02.202,00:52:04.162,I won't stop you.
00:52:05.581,00:52:06.916,June.
00:52:08.918,00:52:10.252,June?
00:52:12.755,00:52:14.048,June!
00:52:15.424,00:52:17.718,...paper clips and Junior Mints...
00:52:20.888,00:52:22.890,Not that I'm saying that's what I did.
00:52:25.684,00:52:27.019,Shit!
00:52:32.900,00:52:34.693,Is this his phone?
00:52:39.115,00:52:40.574,Movement alert.
00:52:42.158,00:52:45.663,5826 Amapola.
00:52:47.581,00:52:50.001,That's a '67 Grand Prix.
00:52:58.550,00:53:00.636,I thought we were off the grid.
00:53:01.177,00:53:02.471,April.
00:53:03.014,00:53:04.807,April?
00:53:04.807,00:53:07.351,April! I know!
00:53:07.351,00:53:10.186,"Listen, April..."
00:53:10.186,00:53:12.898,"April, can you hear me? April!"
00:53:13.732,00:53:15.191,"April, can you..."
00:53:22.992,00:53:25.703,"JUNE ON RECORDING: I know! No, I'm okay!"
00:53:25.703,00:53:28.539,"April, can you hear me?"
00:53:29.832,00:53:31.375,"We don't know, Antonio."
00:53:31.375,00:53:36.421,We traced her phone to the Azores.
00:53:36.421,00:53:38.757,Get to them before the agency.
00:53:46.057,00:53:50.435,Perfect timing.
00:53:50.435,00:53:52.312,You must be thirsty.
00:53:57.317,00:54:00.236,It's coconut.
00:54:03.074,00:54:04.950,Just... Whoa. Okay?
00:54:09.413,00:54:10.915,Okay. Just... Whoa.
00:54:10.915,00:54:12.708,Yeah?
00:54:12.708,00:54:14.126,Yeah!
00:54:15.920,00:54:18.422,Hey. You got skills.
00:54:19.924,00:54:22.551,My dad wanted boys.
00:54:22.551,00:54:23.761,Let me go.
00:54:23.761,00:54:25.971,You can get out anytime you want.
00:54:25.971,00:54:27.305,I'll show you.
00:54:28.432,00:54:30.559,Hands like Houdini.
00:54:30.559,00:54:38.109,"Turn your palms down, and all at once, throw your hands to the ground and your hips back."
00:54:41.195,00:54:42.529,Nice.
00:54:43.572,00:54:45.074,That was good.
00:55:01.423,00:55:02.841,Who are you?
00:55:04.843,00:55:06.262,Really.
00:55:21.110,00:55:22.694,I don't understand.
00:55:25.030,00:55:26.322,Follow me.
00:55:41.546,00:55:44.008,I don't understand.
00:55:45.968,00:55:49.763,My phone is secure.
00:55:49.763,00:55:51.015,And you didn't make a call.
00:55:51.015,00:55:52.933,"No, I didn't make a call."
00:55:52.933,00:55:54.518,I took a call.
00:55:56.895,00:55:58.730,You took a call?
00:55:58.730,00:55:59.982,It was a quick one.
00:55:59.982,00:56:01.317,You...
00:56:04.028,00:56:05.570,Come on.
00:56:05.570,00:56:08.782,"JUNE: I thought we were off the grid, and then the phone rang."
00:56:08.782,00:56:10.450,It was my sister and I had to take the call.
00:56:10.450,00:56:13.578,You know? I didn't want her to worry.
00:56:16.790,00:56:18.500,"No, no, no..."
00:56:18.500,00:56:21.045,I can't get into that.
00:56:21.045,00:56:22.338,I can't get into that.
00:56:23.547,00:56:25.341,June.
00:56:25.341,00:56:29.136,"Just, please, knock me out."
00:56:29.136,00:56:31.055,It's okay.
00:56:31.055,00:56:32.973,You asked me not to drug you.
00:56:32.973,00:56:34.516,"Okay, good."
00:56:44.943,00:56:48.780,like Houdini. Hands...
00:57:10.094,00:57:11.427,Roy?
00:57:18.435,00:57:19.770,I can't feel my face!
00:57:19.770,00:57:20.979,"MILLER: Okay, time."
00:57:20.979,00:57:22.314,"Okay, Simon..."
00:57:24.108,00:57:25.734,"Roy, the pull on this thing..."
00:57:25.734,00:57:27.736,We said 10 minutes.
00:57:27.736,00:57:30.864,"It can pull up to 50,000 metric tons!"
00:57:33.284,00:57:34.492,It's a diesel hydraulic!
00:57:34.492,00:57:36.787,Don't you wanna see your Zephyr?
00:57:36.787,00:57:38.956,Yes.
00:57:53.678,00:57:55.306,Excuse me.
00:57:55.306,00:57:56.598,Can you tell me where we are?
00:57:56.598,00:57:58.558,"Right now, miss?"
00:57:58.558,00:58:00.060,"Austria, huh?"
00:58:01.561,00:58:03.772,"Would you like some breakfast, miss?"
00:58:03.772,00:58:06.317,"Yeah, that would be great. Thanks."
00:58:07.776,00:58:11.280,"Okay, I'm gonna have some pancakes, scrambled eggs..."
00:58:11.280,00:58:12.572,Scrambled eggs.
00:58:12.572,00:58:13.824,With a glass of milk.
00:58:13.824,00:58:15.117,And a glass of milk.
00:58:15.117,00:58:16.910,"Can I get a Harvey Wallbanger, please?"
00:58:16.910,00:58:18.454,"Certainly, sir."
00:58:23.000,00:58:28.422,"You know, statistically, you're a lot more likely to die riding on a train than any other form of transportation."
00:58:30.841,00:58:33.885,10.3 times more likely than dying on a plane.
00:58:35.387,00:58:36.680,Simon?
00:58:38.640,00:58:39.891,Simon Feck?
00:58:42.811,00:58:45.605,My name is June.
00:58:45.981,00:58:47.316,Oh!
00:58:47.316,00:58:49.109,Have you found him yet?
00:58:49.109,00:58:51.528,"No, not yet."
00:58:51.528,00:58:53.989,Don't you wanna answer that?
00:58:53.989,00:58:55.240,But I can't.
00:58:55.240,00:58:57.075,I'm not supposed to.
00:58:57.075,00:58:59.328,It might be Roy.
00:58:59.328,00:59:02.956,"Yeah, but he told me not to answer the phone, because the signal can be tracked."
00:59:02.956,00:59:05.167,That's right.
00:59:13.217,00:59:16.136,Did Roy happen to tell you about the plan here?
00:59:16.136,00:59:18.805,"Are we supposed to meet him here, or..."
00:59:18.805,00:59:20.182,What did you say that drink was?
00:59:20.182,00:59:21.433,A Harvey...
00:59:21.433,00:59:22.767,It's a Harvey Wallbanger.
00:59:22.767,00:59:24.602,Do you mind just ordering me one of those?
00:59:24.602,00:59:26.355,Because it looks great.
00:59:26.355,00:59:28.940,I'll just be right back.
00:59:28.940,00:59:31.068,I'll be right back.
00:59:31.068,00:59:34.363,Something is wrong.
00:59:34.363,00:59:35.655,She didn't answer her phone.
00:59:35.655,00:59:36.990,I told her not to.
00:59:36.990,00:59:38.242,We just got here.
00:59:38.242,00:59:39.410,That's good news.
00:59:39.410,00:59:40.827,I'm sure she'll turn up. Roy...
00:59:40.827,00:59:42.496,I left a note posted right there.
00:59:42.496,00:59:43.830,We may have an issue here.
00:59:43.830,00:59:45.040,The temperature...
00:59:45.040,00:59:47.292,She's hungry...
00:59:47.292,00:59:49.961,It's getting too hot.
00:59:49.961,00:59:52.089,"Yeah, she went to get something to eat."
00:59:52.089,00:59:54.341,"Good. Come on, Simon."
01:00:19.616,01:00:21.326,May I help you?
01:00:21.326,01:00:22.911,I'm feeling a little bit train-sick.
01:00:22.911,01:00:24.662,Is it okay if I hang out here for a while?
01:00:24.662,01:00:27.374,"Of course, I will get you some water."
01:00:29.167,01:00:30.502,Here you go.
01:00:38.969,01:00:43.723,Antonio Quintana wants to know where is the battery?
01:00:52.774,01:00:54.859,Where is the battery?
01:01:06.288,01:01:07.956,Uh...
01:01:07.956,01:01:11.042,"I'm sorry, I'm looking for ice."
01:01:11.042,01:01:12.336,Roy.
01:01:12.336,01:01:13.629,Miller.
01:01:13.629,01:01:16.256,Wrong room.
01:01:16.256,01:01:18.258,You know him?
01:01:18.258,01:01:20.969,"He's an assassin, platinum grade."
01:01:20.969,01:01:22.304,He's come to collect Simon.
01:01:22.304,01:01:23.597,"Oh, my God."
01:01:23.597,01:01:25.974,And to kill you.
01:01:25.974,01:01:28.352,"Yeah, June, Simon."
01:01:32.939,01:01:35.609,Jeez! I'm okay.
01:01:44.117,01:01:45.910,"Simon, please move."
01:01:59.675,01:02:02.802,"You have quite some balls, Fraulein."
01:02:04.012,01:02:05.639,Hands like Houdini.
01:02:14.189,01:02:15.899,I'm so sorry.
01:02:18.360,01:02:20.737,But you were trying to kill me.
01:02:33.208,01:02:34.668,That's disgusting.
01:02:42.759,01:02:45.345,"Oh, my God. Just die!"
01:02:48.390,01:02:49.725,"Oh, shit."
01:02:51.309,01:02:54.271,I got to get you guys someplace safe.
01:03:03.154,01:03:04.489,They're not on the train.
01:03:04.489,01:03:05.907,"Oh, really?"
01:03:05.907,01:03:07.825,Cameras at the last station show nothing.
01:03:07.825,01:03:10.120,They must have gotten off between stops.
01:03:10.120,01:03:11.871,Locals haven't found anything.
01:03:42.860,01:03:44.780,"Always the classics, Roy."
01:03:58.460,01:04:02.213,"JUNE: Salzburg, Austria."
01:04:14.810,01:04:16.144,MILLER: Yes. Uh-huh.
01:04:19.606,01:04:21.608,"No, we just got in."
01:04:23.151,01:04:26.237,"Well, we're talking now."
01:04:26.237,01:04:28.532,"Well, it's good to hear your voice, too, Naomi."
01:04:28.532,01:04:31.535,I'll meet you at the Caprice.
01:04:40.544,01:04:42.671,"It's a beautiful city, huh?"
01:04:43.171,01:04:44.506,Yeah.
01:04:45.716,01:04:48.176,Never seen anything quite like it.
01:04:54.098,01:04:55.809,Neither have I.
01:04:58.812,01:05:00.647,I got to go out for a bit.
01:05:02.524,01:05:04.192,Okay.
01:05:04.192,01:05:08.613,I was thinking about ordering some room service.
01:05:08.613,01:05:12.492,And I thought maybe we could have dinner or something.
01:05:12.492,01:05:15.119,That sounds great.
01:05:15.119,01:05:16.454,9:00 o'clock?
01:05:18.373,01:05:19.916,9:00 sounds great.
01:05:22.878,01:05:24.212,June?
01:05:26.172,01:05:31.094,Could you do me a favor and just stick around here?
01:05:31.094,01:05:34.765,"Oh, yeah, of course."
01:05:34.765,01:05:36.182,See you in a bit.
01:05:40.937,01:05:44.107,They're not gonna hurt you.
01:05:44.107,01:05:46.192,"Now, just breathe, listen to your music."
01:05:46.192,01:05:48.152,"Here, as a matter of fact, I got that for you."
01:05:49.529,01:05:50.988,I know you like them.
01:05:50.988,01:05:53.324,"Cool, thanks."
01:05:53.324,01:05:57.161,"Listen, order as much room service as you like, but don't leave the room."
01:05:57.161,01:05:59.289,Okay.
01:05:59.289,01:06:02.250,We need to talk about the Zephyr later.
01:07:29.629,01:07:31.422,You seem different.
01:07:32.173,01:07:33.508,Do I?
01:07:36.678,01:07:39.806,"So, who's your companion?"
01:07:39.806,01:07:42.684,She's beautiful.
01:07:42.684,01:07:44.185,She seems capable.
01:07:45.311,01:07:46.771,I just met her.
01:07:47.689,01:07:49.774,She's a nobody.
01:07:49.774,01:07:53.570,Just someone I picked up along the way.
01:07:54.487,01:07:55.864,That's a shame.
01:07:57.490,01:08:01.285,This is getting boring.
01:08:03.747,01:08:05.874,Don't speak to me like that.
01:08:08.043,01:08:10.921,"I will speak to you any way I please, Tony."
01:08:10.921,01:08:12.714,We both know you're lucky I'm here.
01:08:15.341,01:08:18.803,I have the battery.
01:08:18.803,01:08:21.639,The world is full of bad guys and people are calling.
01:08:26.436,01:08:27.771,I understand.
01:08:29.146,01:08:31.107,What's your price?
01:08:32.817,01:08:34.694,I have a figure in mind.
01:08:34.694,01:08:37.030,What's it worth to you?
01:08:37.030,01:08:40.116,"Are you angry about your island, Roy?"
01:08:40.116,01:08:42.285,"Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, Tony."
01:08:55.172,01:08:59.385,"I'm Isabel George, Director of Counter Espionage at the CIA."
01:09:00.386,01:09:01.972,I'm sure you are.
01:09:03.848,01:09:05.767,"Forgive me, I just..."
01:09:07.811,01:09:09.938,I just don't know exactly what to believe.
01:09:12.148,01:09:22.867,"Well, that's understandable, considering that the last five days you've been fed a steady diet of misinformation and fantasy by an agent of ours who's recently gone rogue."
01:09:22.867,01:09:26.203,"Well, he said that Fitzgerald was the one that wanted to steal the battery."
01:09:26.203,01:09:28.581,"Well, let's examine the facts."
01:09:28.581,01:09:32.961,Miller told you that he was protecting the Zephyr from people wanting to misuse it.
01:09:32.961,01:09:36.547,But now he's trying to sell it to an international arms dealer.
01:09:36.547,01:09:38.800,Antonio Quintana.
01:09:38.800,01:09:41.385,One of Europe's leading weapons manufacturers.
01:09:42.303,01:09:49.978,"Ask yourself, Miss Havens, has Roy Miller said anything to you that's proven to be true?"
01:09:51.896,01:09:54.107,"JUNE: God, excuse me."
01:09:58.402,01:10:01.906,I was looking at my phone.
01:10:04.200,01:10:08.121,"Oh, my God, I'm so sorry."
01:10:08.121,01:10:10.040,MILLER: This is getting to be a habit.
01:10:10.040,01:10:12.709,"Yeah, it is."
01:10:12.709,01:10:17.296,"ISABEL: He used you as a mule to carry the battery through security, Miss Havens."
01:10:17.296,01:10:19.924,He's been playing you.
01:10:19.924,01:10:22.927,"He's a spy, that's what he does."
01:10:22.927,01:10:26.181,"Any love, empathy, we train that right out of them."
01:10:26.181,01:10:27.974,What did you imagine?
01:10:27.974,01:10:31.477,"The two of you would move into a condo together, get a dog?"
01:10:31.477,01:10:34.731,You can't have a life with him.
01:10:34.731,01:10:36.524,But you can have yours back.
01:10:36.524,01:10:38.275,She's been gone eight minutes.
01:10:38.275,01:10:41.487,We need you to get back to the hotel before Miller.
01:10:43.614,01:10:46.868,What am I supposed to do?
01:10:49.286,01:10:51.206,This pen is a transmitter.
01:10:51.206,01:11:01.716,"Once you have confirmation that Miller has not hidden the Zephyr, that it's somewhere nearby, or on his person, you can confirm this by simply clicking the top button."
01:11:11.101,01:11:12.936,I'm sorry I'm late.
01:11:14.187,01:11:16.022,Everything go okay?
01:11:18.649,01:11:20.068,Well enough.
01:11:24.697,01:11:26.032,It's getting hotter.
01:11:37.001,01:11:39.045,"So, did you get your price?"
01:11:43.466,01:11:45.260,I followed you tonight.
01:11:50.014,01:11:51.766,You have nothing to say?
01:11:52.767,01:11:59.190,Here's to Wichita where we first...
01:12:00.066,01:12:01.943,Bumped into each other.
01:12:05.655,01:12:07.615,"Do you think that was fate, Roy?"
01:12:09.450,01:12:11.327,I don't believe in fate.
01:12:12.369,01:12:14.122,But I believe in luck.
01:12:16.791,01:12:19.043,I don't know what to believe.
01:12:28.261,01:12:29.595,Huh.
01:12:30.972,01:12:33.557,That hurt more than I thought it would.
01:12:38.271,01:12:39.856,I'm going home.
01:12:50.449,01:12:55.246,"They promised that if you turned yourself in, they'd protect you."
01:12:57.707,01:12:59.375,I love your optimism.
01:13:00.626,01:13:02.003,Never lose it.
01:13:09.219,01:13:10.803,FITZGERALD: Get her out of here.
01:13:26.903,01:13:29.113,"MAN: He's not here, sir."
01:13:29.113,01:13:32.116,Did they tell you you're going home?
01:13:32.116,01:13:35.036,"You've seen the inside of the honeycomb, June!"
01:13:35.036,01:13:36.620,You can't go home.
01:13:36.620,01:13:38.873,OFFICER ON RADIO: The suspect is on the roof.
01:13:42.252,01:13:43.586,"FITZGERALD: Oh, shit."
01:14:02.521,01:14:04.648,Director George!
01:14:04.648,01:14:06.192,Get her in the car.
01:14:56.575,01:14:58.828,FITZGERALD: He's heading toward the river.
01:15:12.049,01:15:14.218,Stand down!
01:15:22.977,01:15:24.728,Hey! Hey! Hold it!
01:15:24.728,01:15:25.980,Hold your fire!
01:15:25.980,01:15:27.231,Stand down!
01:15:27.231,01:15:28.565,He has the battery!
01:15:47.543,01:15:49.045,Did you secure the kid?
01:15:49.504,01:15:50.838,Yeah.
01:16:00.139,01:16:01.724,Did they find Roy?
01:16:01.724,01:16:04.727,We'll find the body.
01:16:04.727,01:16:06.812,He went down with the Zephyr.
01:16:42.098,01:16:43.433,"APRIL: Thank you, guys."
01:17:11.001,01:17:13.003,Fitz?
01:17:13.003,01:17:16.382,"Fitz, I think we just made a wrong turn."
01:17:16.382,01:17:18.384,I think we're going south.
01:17:18.384,01:17:20.344,You know what?
01:17:28.603,01:17:30.854,Tell him we're back on track.
01:17:30.854,01:17:34.024,"I don't have the battery, but no one's gonna get it now."
01:17:34.024,01:17:36.152,"Yeah, I've got the next best thing."
01:17:36.152,01:17:38.654,I'll see you in Spain in two days.
01:17:48.998,01:17:50.583,"Hey, Wilmer."
01:17:51.792,01:17:53.836,How was the party?
01:17:53.836,01:17:55.338,I see the goat is still out there.
01:17:55.338,01:17:56.547,Yeah.
01:17:56.547,01:17:58.466,I thought it was a wedding present.
01:17:58.466,01:18:05.264,"It was, but, I think I wanted her to want it more than she wanted it."
01:18:05.264,01:18:07.266,Okay.
01:18:07.266,01:18:11.061,DJ ON RADIO: ...Boston's classic rock station.
01:18:11.061,01:18:12.647,This just come in?
01:18:12.647,01:18:15.358,G-body Grand Prix.
01:18:16.317,01:18:17.901,Gonna be a real beaut.
01:18:26.827,01:18:30.914,Ru-pa... Fee-pa...
01:18:30.914,01:18:33.709,5826 Amapola.
01:18:36.504,01:18:38.506,That's like an hour from here.
01:18:39.340,01:18:41.384,Maybe it's a safe house.
01:19:16.043,01:19:17.628,Here we go.
01:20:14.977,01:20:16.979,Who's out there?
01:20:16.979,01:20:18.981,"MOLLY: Oh, Frank, look at her!"
01:20:18.981,01:20:21.776,I want to know what she's doing on my lawn in the middle of the night.
01:20:21.776,01:20:23.611,I... I have the pistons you ordered.
01:20:23.611,01:20:25.154,Pistons?
01:20:25.154,01:20:26.947,For the '67 Grand Prix.
01:20:26.947,01:20:29.158,"Molly, I didn't..."
01:20:29.158,01:20:31.702,You are all wet.
01:20:39.209,01:20:41.962,"That Pontiac you have out there, Frank, is a real classic."
01:20:41.962,01:20:43.547,Mmm-hmm.
01:20:43.547,01:20:46.342,I really love pre-'70s Grand Prixs.
01:20:46.342,01:20:47.593,Mmm-hmm.
01:20:47.593,01:20:50.304,"So, you two lived here long?"
01:20:50.304,01:20:54.433,This old place?
01:20:54.433,01:20:58.020,"Sit down, honey."
01:20:58.020,01:21:01.148,"Frank thinks we should move, but you know what?"
01:21:01.148,01:21:04.901,"And we can afford to stay, thanks to Publishers Clearing House."
01:21:07.571,01:21:09.198,You won Publishers Clearing House?
01:21:09.198,01:21:10.616,Twice.
01:21:10.616,01:21:14.411,"Plus, we won two lotto quick picks Frank doesn't even remember buying."
01:21:14.411,01:21:16.497,Because I didn't buy them.
01:21:16.497,01:21:18.999,"Oh, yeah, like you didn't order pistons off the Internet."
01:21:18.999,01:21:23.045,"You don't know what you're typing into that computer, Frank."
01:21:23.045,01:21:25.964,"Another couple of minutes on your clothes, honey."
01:21:30.886,01:21:32.221,Roy Miller.
01:21:33.889,01:21:36.392,"This was one of his safe houses, wasn't it?"
01:21:39.645,01:21:41.480,What in the hell are you talking about?
01:21:43.524,01:21:44.900,"Honey, what's this all about?"
01:21:46.902,01:21:51.281,"I just thought, maybe..."
01:21:51.281,01:21:53.576,I must've had this all wrong.
01:21:53.576,01:21:59.749,"I was just looking for some information about my friend, Roy."
01:21:59.749,01:22:02.959,"If you'd like to change, there's a powder room right there."
01:22:14.221,01:22:16.181,"That's our son, Matthew."
01:22:16.181,01:22:19.435,We lost him in Kuwait.
01:22:19.435,01:22:22.646,"He saved the lives of two of his crewmen, and..."
01:22:24.064,01:22:25.733,He just always took care of everyone.
01:22:25.733,01:22:27.443,He was an Eagle Scout.
01:22:27.443,01:22:30.905,This was taken the day he got that swimming badge.
01:22:30.905,01:22:36.493,He could swim clear across Lake Sunapee with practically one breath.
01:22:38.746,01:22:40.289,"I just, um..."
01:22:41.498,01:22:44.501,I've been terribly rude.
01:22:44.501,01:22:46.420,I'm June Havens.
01:22:46.420,01:22:49.005,Molly Knight.
01:22:49.005,01:22:54.637,"This is June Havens, and I'm leaving a message on my own machine for whoever is listening to this phone call."
01:22:54.637,01:22:56.972,I have the Zephyr.
01:22:56.972,01:22:59.642,"I have the Zephyr, and I'm ready to make a deal."
01:23:01.101,01:23:06.106,"I'm sitting on Route 28, right outside New Hampshire."
01:23:06.106,01:23:10.068,"And if you want the Zephyr, you better come and get it."
01:23:45.562,01:23:46.856,"Hey, fellas."
01:23:52.194,01:23:56.532,"So, you want the Zephyr?"
01:23:56.532,01:23:59.075,I got the Zephyr.
01:23:59.075,01:24:00.911,Come and get it.
01:24:17.427,01:24:21.097,Come on. Let's go!
01:24:21.097,01:24:22.808,Ouch!
01:24:33.861,01:24:36.822,Today is the festival of San Fermin.
01:24:39.033,01:24:41.994,"Have you ever seen a bullfight, Miss Havens?"
01:24:48.250,01:24:51.086,My name is Antonio Quintana.
01:24:51.086,01:24:52.629,I know who you are.
01:24:55.049,01:24:57.509,What did he give me?
01:24:57.509,01:24:59.803,It's something we're developing at my company.
01:24:59.803,01:25:02.097,A new kind of truth serum.
01:25:02.097,01:25:03.807,Really?
01:25:05.434,01:25:11.648,"I have a few questions for you about the battery, since we both know what you gave to my men was a joke."
01:25:11.648,01:25:12.900,Wow.
01:25:15.569,01:25:17.821,I don't like you very much.
01:25:19.615,01:25:21.283,The truth!
01:25:23.243,01:25:24.745,Good!
01:25:26.038,01:25:27.372,JUNE: Wow.
01:25:27.372,01:25:30.084,"You know, I really like Miller, though."
01:25:30.084,01:25:33.211,"'Cause, you know, I was totally wrong about him in Salzburg."
01:25:33.211,01:25:35.881,He wanted me to hear that phone call so that I would follow him.
01:25:35.881,01:25:38.425,"I'd turn him in, and then he could get me home safely."
01:25:38.425,01:25:40.052,He was trying to protect me.
01:25:40.052,01:25:42.012,Shut up.
01:25:42.012,01:25:45.515,It's crazy that I could feel so powerful and capable around him...
01:25:45.515,01:25:48.852,Shut up.
01:25:48.852,01:25:53.231,Shut up!
01:25:53.231,01:25:56.359,"I bet you've never made a girl an omelette, have you, Antonio?"
01:25:59.362,01:26:00.823,"Don't test me, June."
01:26:00.823,01:26:03.241,Or got her to her sister's wedding on time.
01:26:03.241,01:26:05.494,"It's really the little things, honestly."
01:26:05.494,01:26:07.955,But they count so much.
01:26:09.372,01:26:11.792,Miller is dead!
01:26:13.043,01:26:14.920,No.
01:26:14.920,01:26:17.506,"No, he's not."
01:26:19.215,01:26:20.717,He is dead!
01:26:57.587,01:27:02.885,I'm not gonna ask you again.
01:26:57.587,01:27:05.804,"But if you don't tell me what I need to know, I don't know where the battery is."
01:27:05.804,01:27:07.890,Then why did you tell everyone you had it? Why?
01:27:07.890,01:27:09.808,Because I was trying to find Roy.
01:27:12.769,01:27:17.858,"Well, Antonio, whenever there's bad guys like you around, Roy's not too far away."
01:27:21.862,01:27:24.073,You're gonna die.
01:27:34.875,01:27:36.210,Finally!
01:27:37.544,01:27:40.005,"Nice to meet you, John."
01:27:40.005,01:27:41.256,Antonio.
01:27:41.256,01:27:43.383,Too bad you couldn't get the battery.
01:27:45.969,01:27:47.429,Where is the boy?
01:27:50.182,01:27:52.768,"You didn't think I'd just bring the package, did you?"
01:27:55.229,01:27:57.898,Why don't you follow me down to the river and bring the money?
01:27:57.898,01:27:59.191,Okay.
01:28:32.182,01:28:33.934,JUNE: Is this thatching in here?
01:28:33.934,01:28:36.186,Because I've never seen anything like that before.
01:28:36.186,01:28:39.856,"We have really old architecture in Boston, but nothing like this."
01:28:39.856,01:28:42.609,"You're really lucky, because this place is..."
01:28:42.609,01:28:46.113,Let me tell you.
01:28:46.113,01:28:47.363,My thoughts are so clear.
01:28:48.907,01:28:51.743,"Is this all weapons money, or is this family money?"
01:28:53.578,01:28:56.581,"Gardens! He likes gardens, huh?"
01:28:56.581,01:28:58.541,JUNE: Do you guys ever do any gardening?
01:28:58.541,01:29:01.461,It's really relaxing.
01:29:01.461,01:29:04.840,This really is a happy place. Look at these trumpet flowers. They...
01:29:04.840,01:29:06.925,"Okay, Eduardo, you don't have to pull me around."
01:29:06.925,01:29:09.261,"You can just tell me where you want me to go, okay?"
01:29:09.261,01:29:10.846,"This way, blondie."
01:29:10.846,01:29:13.849,See? Now we're communicating.
01:29:13.849,01:29:16.018,I bet you're taking me someplace safe and secure.
01:29:16.018,01:29:17.936,Someplace special.
01:29:17.936,01:29:19.980,Antonio has a special place?
01:29:19.980,01:29:21.731,Everyone should have a special place.
01:29:31.241,01:29:32.534,Luis?
01:29:32.534,01:29:34.452,"Is there a problem, Eduardo?"
01:29:40.750,01:29:43.837,"Hi, Roy."
01:29:43.837,01:29:46.006,You're supposed to be dead.
01:29:46.006,01:29:47.966,You don't have to.
01:29:47.966,01:29:49.676,"I just, you know, caught up with him."
01:29:49.676,01:29:50.969,That's cool.
01:29:56.183,01:29:58.560,His name is Eduardo.
01:30:00.937,01:30:08.195,"I need you to listen, because when you wake up, you're gonna call your boss and you're gonna tell him that Roy Miller, that's me, has the battery and escaped with the girl."
01:30:08.195,01:30:09.988,You have the battery?
01:30:09.988,01:30:12.366,Oh.
01:30:13.533,01:30:14.951,Yes.
01:30:15.869,01:30:17.453,Let's go.
01:30:17.453,01:30:20.582,I'm worried about Simon.
01:30:20.582,01:30:22.959,My tracker has been spotty.
01:30:22.959,01:30:25.379,Life with you is so exciting.
01:30:25.379,01:30:26.546,I took too long to get here.
01:30:26.546,01:30:27.923,7:00.
01:30:27.923,01:30:29.258,7:00.
01:30:38.225,01:30:40.476,I think I feel like having sex.
01:30:42.436,01:30:44.106,I think we'd have really great sex.
01:30:45.481,01:30:46.900,Did they give you something?
01:30:47.567,01:30:48.860,Uh-huh.
01:30:48.860,01:30:50.946,You should hydrate.
01:30:50.946,01:30:52.281,Roy?
01:30:58.328,01:30:59.662,Roy.
01:31:13.593,01:31:16.221,June?
01:31:16.221,01:31:18.807,"You don't seem very happy to see me, Roy."
01:31:20.309,01:31:21.643,What?
01:31:22.311,01:31:23.645,Not really.
01:31:53.467,01:31:55.593,So the red dot is us?
01:31:55.593,01:31:57.511,The red dot is Simon.
01:31:57.511,01:32:00.015,ANTONIO: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
01:32:14.237,01:32:15.697,Air time.
01:32:35.091,01:32:37.093,He says his name is Roy Miller.
01:32:37.093,01:32:38.803,He says he has the battery.
01:32:44.518,01:32:45.852,Miller is here.
01:32:48.897,01:32:50.524,There he is!
01:32:50.524,01:32:51.900,There he is!
01:32:53.567,01:32:55.237,This way. Follow me!
01:33:07.499,01:33:08.833,Bulls?
01:33:25.267,01:33:26.935,There's Fitz!
01:34:18.861,01:34:20.654,Take the guns.
01:34:22.073,01:34:23.741,Here.
01:34:23.741,01:34:24.993,What next?
01:34:24.993,01:34:26.328,Let them have it.
01:34:50.268,01:34:52.979,"June Havens, you've got skills."
01:34:55.440,01:34:56.774,Let's go!
01:35:09.996,01:35:11.247,Go.
01:35:35.480,01:35:36.981,See you down there.
01:35:36.981,01:35:38.316,No.
01:35:42.987,01:35:44.322,Sorry.
01:35:47.741,01:35:49.202,Get up.
01:35:59.003,01:36:00.338,"Freeze right there, Roy!"
01:36:00.338,01:36:01.590,"Hey, Simon."
01:36:01.590,01:36:03.007,"Get down on your knees, now!"
01:36:03.007,01:36:05.009,Roy!
01:36:05.009,01:36:07.554,Put them in the water.
01:36:07.554,01:36:11.266,"I just want the kid, Fitz."
01:36:11.266,01:36:13.809,"I hope you brought what I want, otherwise I'll kill him."
01:36:13.809,01:36:16.145,"And I swear to you, I'll do it."
01:36:16.145,01:36:19.148,I believe you.
01:36:19.148,01:36:21.359,I understand.
01:36:21.359,01:36:22.985,I'm just gonna get the battery.
01:36:22.985,01:36:25.029,It's right here.
01:36:25.029,01:36:26.531,"Please don't give it to him. No, no."
01:36:26.531,01:36:28.283,"Roy, Roy, please don't give it to him."
01:36:29.659,01:36:31.536,FITZGERALD: Put it on the deck.
01:36:31.536,01:36:33.829,"Roy, don't give it to him!"
01:36:33.829,01:36:35.789,"Simon, it's okay."
01:36:35.789,01:36:38.460,Shut it!
01:36:45.383,01:36:47.093,"Okay. Okay, I'll make another one."
01:36:47.093,01:36:48.928,You don't understand.
01:36:48.928,01:36:50.597,SIMON: I'll just make another one.
01:36:50.597,01:36:52.056,Make another one?
01:37:09.616,01:37:11.117,Am I dying?
01:37:12.327,01:37:13.911,"No, you fainted."
01:37:15.037,01:37:16.289,I'm sorry.
01:37:16.289,01:37:17.791,"No, that's okay."
01:37:17.791,01:37:19.709,"No, no. I've been trying to tell you..."
01:37:24.464,01:37:26.382,Why is it hot?
01:37:26.382,01:37:29.093,Because it's filled with power.
01:37:29.093,01:37:31.680,The battery...
01:37:31.680,01:37:33.723,I know. It's unstable.
01:37:33.723,01:37:35.057,Hmm.
01:37:45.276,01:37:48.988,"You're a smart guy, Simon."
01:37:53.409,01:37:54.828,"Oh, my glasses."
01:37:56.204,01:37:59.040,"Roy, you're shot."
01:38:01.250,01:38:02.627,Get help.
01:38:18.017,01:38:20.144,"You're beautiful, June Havens."
01:38:32.532,01:38:35.284,Stay with me.
01:38:36.452,01:38:37.746,Stay with me.
01:38:41.082,01:38:44.335,"We're here now, Miller."
01:38:46.880,01:38:48.631,DOCTOR: Charge at 360.
01:38:48.631,01:38:50.007,Clear!
01:39:06.858,01:39:17.911,"I said It's been a spectacular couple of weeks, Miller."
01:39:20.872,01:39:22.916,"It's good to see you, Isabel."
01:39:25.710,01:39:27.044,"Hi, guys."
01:39:28.463,01:39:30.214,"You cleaned house, Roy."
01:39:31.965,01:39:33.967,I have to thank you for that.
01:39:35.428,01:39:37.305,the wrong man.
01:39:37.931,01:39:39.307,It happens.
01:39:41.935,01:39:45.187,Simon's happy.
01:39:46.856,01:39:48.190,Where is June?
01:39:49.442,01:39:51.110,I sent her home.
01:39:54.238,01:39:57.032,She gets it.
01:39:57.032,01:40:00.411,She knows you two lead different lives and she's moving on.
01:40:00.411,01:40:01.913,As should you.
01:40:04.998,01:40:07.042,You gave up those things.
01:40:07.042,01:40:10.880,You let go of who you were.
01:40:12.005,01:40:14.342,Why are we still talking about this?
01:40:14.342,01:40:16.636,Because the agency invested a lot in you.
01:40:16.636,01:40:19.973,And you're an asset only as long as you stay focused.
01:40:28.815,01:40:30.149,You look good.
01:40:31.359,01:40:33.402,Get some rest.
01:40:33.402,01:40:37.239,We got to transfer you to a secure facility tomorrow.
01:41:05.058,01:41:07.687,Nurse? What...
01:41:23.244,01:41:24.996,"Stay under there, Roy."
01:41:26.079,01:41:27.415,You're dead.
01:41:30.626,01:41:32.837,"Make way, please."
01:41:32.837,01:41:34.255,Going to the mortuary.
01:41:39.886,01:41:42.513,"Don't worry, Roy."
01:41:43.681,01:41:45.600,It's time for a vacation.
01:41:49.270,01:42:46.953,"JUNE: Hey, there, sleepy head."
01:42:49.288,01:42:50.748,What day is it?
01:42:51.833,01:42:53.166,Someday.
01:42:54.877,01:42:56.378,"Someday, Roy."
01:43:05.888,01:43:07.598,What am I wearing?
01:43:09.642,01:43:10.977,A pair of shorts.
01:43:13.146,01:43:14.814,How did I get into shorts?
01:43:16.440,01:43:22.947,"Roy, I've been trained to rebuild a six-speed transmission with nothing but a pair of pliers and a crescent wrench."
01:43:22.947,01:43:25.783,I think I can get you into a pair of shorts without looking.
01:43:26.868,01:43:28.452,I'm not saying that's what I did.
01:43:30.913,01:43:32.790,You're both the navigator and the DJ.
01:43:32.790,01:43:35.793,And we have a long way to go to Cape Horn.
01:43:38.087,01:43:41.256,"With me, without me."
01:43:38.087,01:43:44.593,"With me, without me."
01:43:45.178,01:43:46.595,With you.
01:43:46.595,01:43:49.182,"Put some tunes on the radio, Mr. DJ."
01:43:49.891,01:43:51.184,"Yes, ma'am."
01:44:16.417,01:44:17.919,"MOLLY: Oh, my God, Frank."
01:44:17.919,01:44:20.379,What is this envelope with tickets to Cape Horn?
01:44:20.379,01:44:21.881,FRANK: What are you talking about?
01:44:21.881,01:44:24.341,Did you order tickets to South America?
01:44:24.341,01:44:26.802,"Molly, I didn't order tickets to anywhere."
01:44:26.802,01:44:29.346,"You don't know what you're typing on that computer, Frank."
01:44:29.346,01:44:31.390,Molly...
01:44:31.390,01:44:33.642,Molly...
01:44:33.642,01:45:45.380,"so awesome-blossom and beautiful with you, baby be with me sooner or later I have to wait impatiently want it someday girl that's why it's called the present night and day, girl let's fly away, girl a little taste of heaven live my life no regrets at all and loving the fall sooner or later I have to wait impatiently."
