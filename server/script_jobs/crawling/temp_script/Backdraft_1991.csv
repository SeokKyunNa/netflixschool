00:58:55.199,00:58:57.117,I WAS ASSIGNED TO THIS OFFICE BY THE CITY.
00:58:57.117,00:58:59.744,YOU BETTER GET USED TO ME.
00:58:59.744,00:59:02.580,"I KNEW YOUR FATHER, TOO."
00:59:02.580,00:59:04.416,HE HAD A HELL OF A REPUTATION.
00:59:04.416,00:59:07.044,BUT IT DON'T CUT SLACK HERE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.
00:59:07.044,00:59:10.255,"SWAYZAK SENDS YOU HERE, FINE. I GOTTA EAT YOU."
00:59:10.255,00:59:12.341,I GOT NOTHIN' TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
00:59:12.341,00:59:15.635,"SWAYZAK OR NO, YOU WORK FOR ME NOW."
00:59:15.635,00:59:17.971,"STEP OUTTA LINE, MAKE ONE FALSE MOVE, YOU'RE OUTTA HERE."
00:59:17.971,00:59:20.098,DON'T THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST.
00:59:22.017,00:59:24.228,LET'S GO.
00:59:24.228,00:59:25.687,PEST CONTROL.
00:59:35.906,00:59:39.951,"HI, SHADOW."
00:59:39.951,00:59:44.706,I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.
00:59:44.706,00:59:47.251,WHO'S THAT?
00:59:47.251,00:59:49.211,IS HE A FIREMAN?
00:59:49.211,00:59:51.213,"YOU LIKE EVERYBODY, RONALD."
00:59:51.213,00:59:56.009,BRIAN McCAFFREY.
00:59:58.053,01:00:00.805,HE'S THE LITTLE ONE WITH THE HAT.
01:00:00.805,01:00:03.600,"OH, WHAT A TREAT!"
01:00:03.600,01:00:06.811,"HEY, DO I KNOW YOU?"
01:00:08.772,01:00:11.066,WHO THE HELL IS THIS GUY?
01:00:11.066,01:00:18.115,"COME ON, SHADOW. HE LOST HIS DAD TO THE ANIMAL AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM WHO HE WAS COMING TO SEE?"
01:00:18.115,01:00:22.077,LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT RONALD.
01:00:22.077,01:00:27.916,LIKES TO TAPE WOODEN MATCHES TO THE BELL STRIKERS AND THEN WRAP IT IN COTTON WITH GASOLINE.
01:00:27.916,01:00:30.961,"HAD A WHOLE LITTLE THING GOIN', HUH? AND WHEN YOU GOT BORED?"
01:00:30.961,01:00:32.879,WHAT'D YOU DO?
01:00:32.879,01:00:36.174,HE STARTED MAKIN' CALLS.
01:00:37.759,01:00:39.928,TELL HIM ABOUT US DOWN ON STATE STREET.
01:00:39.928,01:00:44.057,NAH. NOBODY CARES ABOUT THAT ONE.
01:00:44.057,01:00:47.978,IT WAS YOUR BASIC WAREHOUSE TORCH I WAS DOIN' FOR THE OWNER.
01:00:47.978,01:00:50.772,"I MEAN, THEY'RE A CAKEWALK."
01:00:47.978,01:00:55.860,I JUST-- I JUST LOST MY CONCENTRATION AND MY ANIMAL TURNED ON ME.
01:00:55.860,01:00:58.071,GOT THE WHOLE PLACE GOING LIKE HELL.
01:00:58.071,01:01:03.701,"MY HAIR WAS ON FIRE, MY HANDS, EVERYTHING."
01:01:03.701,01:01:05.912,THEN SUDDENLY I WAS ALIVE.
01:01:03.701,01:01:08.582,"I WAS PULLED OUT OF THERE BY MY HERO, MY SHADOW HERE."
01:01:08.582,01:01:12.377,"EXCEPT, HE DIDN'T SEE THIS BIG TUB OF PHOSPHOROUS, DID YOU?"
01:01:12.377,01:01:16.798,"EXPLOSION LIT HIM UP SO BRIGHT, LEFT HIS SHADOW ON THE WALL."
01:01:16.798,01:01:20.385,"STILL SHY ABOUT ROLLING UP YOUR SLEEVES, SHADOW?"
01:01:20.385,01:01:22.679,SHOW HIM YOUR STOMACH.
01:01:22.679,01:01:29.603,"THE FUNNY THING ABOUT FIREMEN-- NIGHT AND DAY, THEY'RE ALWAYS FIREMEN."
01:01:29.603,01:01:31.813,RONALD BARTEL.
01:01:34.399,01:01:43.992,"ALL RIGHT, THE PAROLE BOARD HAS RECEIVED MR. BARTEL'S FITNESS REPORT, HIS I.D. 44, ENDORSEMENT FROM HIS SECTION WARDEN."
01:01:43.992,01:01:46.036,DR. NORRIS?
01:01:46.036,01:01:51.041,"AS SUPERVISING PSYCHIATRIST, I WOULD DESCRIBE MR. BARTEL'S PROGRESS AS REMARKABLE."
01:01:51.041,01:01:56.213,"TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HIS DISABILITY AND THE SIX YEARS HE'S ALREADY SERVED, I RECOMMEND PAROLE."
01:01:56.213,01:02:01.176,"MR. BARTEL, DO YOU REGRET YOUR CRIMES?"
01:02:01.176,01:02:10.394,"YES, AND-- AND I'M AWARE OF THE PAIN THAT I HAVE CAUSED."
01:02:10.394,01:02:13.104,"IF RELEASED, WILL YOU COMMIT THESE CRIMES AGAIN?"
01:02:13.104,01:02:15.148,"NO. NO, I WON'T."
01:02:15.148,01:02:18.318,DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF READY FOR SOCIETY?
01:02:18.318,01:02:20.237,"YES, I DO."
01:02:21.946,01:02:24.741,"YEAH, RIGHT, RONALD."
01:02:24.741,01:02:27.160,EXCUSE ME.
01:02:27.160,01:02:30.581,SHADOW.
01:02:30.581,01:02:32.708,"REMEMBER THIS, RONALD?"
01:02:32.708,01:02:34.959,REMEMBER WHO IT BELONGED TO?
01:02:34.959,01:02:37.379,WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT LITTLE GIRL?
01:02:37.379,01:02:40.382,"THAT'S NOT FAIR, SHADOW."
01:02:40.382,01:02:42.842,WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT LITTLE GIRL?
01:02:53.937,01:02:56.356,I BURNED HER.
01:02:56.356,01:02:58.400,YOU BURNED HER.
01:02:58.400,01:03:00.360,"WHAT DO YOU DO TO OLD LADIES, RONALD?"
01:03:03.655,01:03:05.073,BURN THEM.
01:03:05.073,01:03:07.867,"AND WHAT ABOUT THE WORLD, RONALD?"
01:03:07.867,01:03:10.537,WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO WITH THE WHOLE WORLD?
01:03:12.289,01:03:15.792,BURN IT ALL.
01:03:23.467,01:03:25.176,"SEE YA NEXT YEAR, RONALD."
01:04:03.381,01:04:07.135,"YEAH, WE FIGURED THE BODY'S THE OWNER, SOME GUY NAMED COSGROVE."
01:04:07.135,01:04:12.265,"WEIRD BLAST, THOUGH, LIKE THAT OTHER GUY WHO WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF HIS OWN CAR."
01:04:12.265,01:04:15.769,EXPLOSION BLEW OUT THE FLAME BEFORE THE ENGINE GOT HERE.
01:04:15.769,01:04:19.189,GOOD FOR US; NOT TOO GOOD FOR HIM.
01:04:31.993,01:04:33.244,BRING THE TOOLBOX.
01:04:39.042,01:04:41.085,"TIM, GET THE HOT SPOTS."
01:04:41.085,01:04:44.088,"YOU IN THE CHEAP SEATS, WATCH IT."
01:04:45.173,01:04:47.091,THERE'S BRIAN.
01:04:47.091,01:04:48.176,"WELL, LET'S GO."
01:04:51.221,01:04:54.850,"HEY, McCAFFREY, NEED A SPECIAL INVITATION? COME ON."
01:04:56.393,01:04:58.186,"CHARGE THE LINE, AXE."
01:05:00.564,01:05:04.860,WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO WITH THIS STUFF?
01:05:04.860,01:05:07.738,WE GOT HEAVY SMOKE STAINS OBSERVED IN ENTRY ROOM.
01:05:07.738,01:05:10.240,SMOKE DEMARCATION LINE IS VERY LOW.
01:05:10.240,01:05:13.744,FIRE NEVER GOT HOT ENOUGH HERE TO COOK THE SOOT OFF.
01:05:16.079,01:05:19.708,"COME ON, YOU SNEAKY LITTLE SON OF A BITCH."
01:05:19.708,01:05:23.044,"COME ON, TELL ME WHERE YOU CAME FROM."
01:05:23.044,01:05:25.797,POINT ME WHERE YOU STARTED.
01:05:25.797,01:05:27.965,COME ON.
01:05:32.095,01:05:36.391,BURN INDICATORS DISTENDED TOWARD NORTHERN WALL.
01:05:36.391,01:05:38.935,"LESS SOOT HERE, MORE HEAT."
01:05:38.935,01:05:41.187,LACK OF DISCOLORATION IN SHATTERED GLASS...
01:05:41.187,01:05:44.941,INDICATES SLOW BURN BEFORE EXPLOSION.
01:05:46.568,01:05:49.362,THERE'S SOME LITTLE DEAD RAT CRITTERS HERE.
01:05:51.740,01:05:55.535,FIRE ORIGINATED IN THIS ROOM.
01:05:55.535,01:05:57.495,HUNG OUT.
01:05:57.495,01:05:59.831,BUT THEN THE AIR RAN OUT.
01:05:59.831,01:06:01.833,SO IT COULDN'T BREATHE.
01:06:01.833,01:06:04.502,BUT IT WASN'T DEAD.
01:06:04.502,01:06:10.592,"MUST HAVE BEEN ALL THAT TRAPPED HEAT LYING LOW, WAITING FOR SOME SUCKER TO GIVE IT ONE BIG GULP OF AIR."
01:06:10.592,01:06:12.135,ANOTHER BACKDRAFT.
01:06:19.810,01:06:22.145,THIS IS OUR POINT OF ORIGIN.
01:06:30.278,01:06:32.029,NO SIGN OF ACCELERANTS.
01:06:34.950,01:06:38.161,"WELL, IF IT'S ARSON, SOMEBODY FIGURED A NEW WAY TO HIDE IT."
01:06:41.498,01:06:45.168,"OKAY, WE GOT ALAN SEAGRAVE..."
01:06:45.168,01:06:47.128,AND DONALD COSGROVE.
01:06:48.964,01:06:52.843,BOTH DEATHS DUE TO CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH STATIONARY OBJECTS.
01:06:54.469,01:07:00.016,"WE HAVE AN OFFICE DOOR FOR COSGROVE AND, OH, AN '87 PORSCHE FOR SEAGRAVE."
01:07:00.016,01:07:02.978,NO NON-RELEVANT TRAUMAS.
01:07:04.187,01:07:07.440,NO SIGNIFICANT BLOOD TOXICOLOGY.
01:07:07.440,01:07:12.153,ATTITUDE OF BOTH TRAJECTORIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH EXPLOSION.
01:07:12.153,01:07:15.114,THEY RAN THE RESIDUE YOU SCRAPED FROM BOTH FRONT DOORS.
01:07:15.114,01:07:18.201,IT'S A COMBINATION OF PLUMBER'S PUTTY AND RAYOPHENE GUM.
01:07:18.201,01:07:20.161,IT BURNS ALMOST COMPLETELY AWAY WHEN YOU LIGHT IT.
01:07:20.161,01:07:22.831,SO IT WAS ON BOTH DOORS?
01:07:22.831,01:07:24.833,SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU.
01:07:24.833,01:07:29.295,"McCAFFREY, WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER AND HELP US?"
01:07:29.295,01:07:32.131,"NO, I DON'T THINK SO."
01:07:32.131,01:07:34.384,I JUST REWROTE YOUR CONTRACT.
01:07:34.384,01:07:37.012,COME ON OVER AND HELP US.
01:07:39.514,01:07:41.391,"ANYWAY, HERE, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIFT HIM."
01:07:42.350,01:07:44.143,GREAT.
01:07:44.143,01:07:46.312,"JESUS CHRIST, HE'S NOT GONNA SELL YOU INSURANCE."
01:07:46.312,01:07:47.397,JUST LIFT HIM UP.
01:07:49.733,01:07:50.817,HOLD ON.
01:07:52.109,01:07:54.153,YOU SEE THAT PATCH OF SHIRT RIGHT THERE?
01:07:54.153,01:07:56.406,WE WONDERED ABOUT THE DISCOLORATION.
01:07:56.406,01:07:58.909,SO I SCRAPED A PIECE OFF AND RAN A SPECTRO ON IT.
01:07:58.909,01:08:03.120,"ON A LUCKY SHOT, THEY PICKED UP TRACES OF SOMETHING."
01:08:03.120,01:08:04.873,WHAT WAS IT?
01:08:04.873,01:08:07.792,"AH, TRYCHTICHLORATE."
01:08:07.792,01:08:10.169,NOBODY AROUND HERE EVER HEARD OF IT.
01:08:10.169,01:08:12.756,"YEAH, TRYCHTICHLORATE."
01:08:12.756,01:08:14.883,IT'S AN ABSORPTION CATALYST USED IN TOXIC WASTE ACCIDENTS.
01:08:14.883,01:08:18.011,IT'S RARE.
01:08:18.011,01:08:21.389,WE FIGURED IT GOT IN HIS CLOTHES IN A GAS STATE FROM THE FIRE.
01:08:21.389,01:08:23.349,WHAT WAS IT DOING IN THE FIRE?
01:08:23.349,01:08:26.269,THAT'S YOUR JOB.
01:08:32.358,01:08:35.152,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
01:08:35.152,01:08:37.280,JUST FIXIN' MY ROOF.
01:08:37.280,01:08:41.242,YOU'VE GOTTA STOP JUST SHOWING UP ON THE ROOF LIKE THIS.
01:08:41.242,01:08:48.249,"LOOK, I JUST-- I WANTED TO, I DON'T KNOW, NOT EXACTLY APOLOGIZE FOR THE OTHER NIGHT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH."
01:08:48.249,01:08:51.628,"YEAH, I KNOW. I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW, SOMETHING."
01:08:51.628,01:08:55.131,THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR.
01:09:02.346,01:09:04.348,"SO WHAT'S GOING ON, STEPHEN?"
01:09:06.392,01:09:11.314,COME ON.
01:09:11.314,01:09:13.942,HOW'S BRIAN DOING?
01:09:13.942,01:09:16.611,HE'S OUT. HE QUIT.
01:09:16.611,01:09:18.905,"MMM. JUST UP AND QUIT FOR NO REASON, HUH?"
01:09:18.905,01:09:24.327,"I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU HEARD, HELEN, I TREATED HIM BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PROBIE I EVER HAD. ALL RIGHT?"
01:09:24.327,01:09:28.999,HE PROBABLY HATES MY GUTS BUT AT LEAST HE FINALLY TOOK A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
01:09:28.999,01:09:32.127,"SO ONCE AGAIN, STEPHEN'S RIGHT AND SOMEBODY ELSE IS WRONG."
01:09:32.127,01:09:34.045,YOU ALWAYS GOTTA BE RIGHT.
01:09:34.045,01:09:36.547,THAT'S SUCH BULLSHIT.
01:09:36.547,01:09:39.759,BECAUSE I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT WHEN I'M WRONG.
01:09:39.759,01:09:41.469,YEAH?
01:09:41.469,01:09:43.262,IN A FIRE?
01:09:46.307,01:09:47.809,"HE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT, HELEN."
01:09:49.268,01:09:56.233,"I'M TELLING YA, MAYBE NOT TODAY, MAYBE NOT NEXT YEAR; BUT IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED."
01:09:56.233,01:10:01.197,I COULDN'T JUST-- YOU JUST COULDN'T LIVE WITH THAT.
01:10:06.452,01:10:07.578,McCAFFREY.
01:10:15.252,01:10:16.671,TAKE THE TOP OFF.
01:10:21.384,01:10:22.927,HOLY SHIT!
01:10:22.927,01:10:25.847,THAT'S IT.
01:10:25.847,01:10:29.559,SON OF A BITCH!
01:10:29.559,01:10:31.061,WHO?
01:10:31.061,01:10:33.897,HE USED MAGNESIUM TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.
01:10:33.897,01:10:35.773,I GOT IT AFTER WE WENT TO SEE RONALD.
01:10:35.773,01:10:38.026,TORCHERS WANT TO FRY THE WHOLE GODDAMN WORLD.
01:10:38.026,01:10:41.654,BUT THE FIRES THAT KILLED THOSE GUYS NEVER BURNED UP THAT MUCH.
01:10:41.654,01:10:45.282,"THE TRYCHTICHLORATE HID THE MAGNESIUM IN THE PLUG, BUT IT BURNED SLOW."
01:10:45.282,01:10:47.577,AND HE MADE HIS BURNS BACKDRAFTS.
01:10:47.577,01:10:51.206,BUT HE KILLED THESE GUYS.
01:10:51.206,01:10:54.542,BACKDRAFT BLEW OUT THE FLAME.
01:10:55.668,01:10:58.588,WHAT REASON?
01:10:58.588,01:11:03.551,WHOEVER FRIED SEAGRAVE AND COSGROVE WENT TO A HELL OF A LOT OF TROUBLE TO MAKE SURE THEY DIED BY FIRE.
01:11:03.551,01:11:06.012,THEY ALSO MADE SURE THAT THE FIRE BLEW ITSELF OUT.
01:11:06.012,01:11:08.639,SO THAT'S WHY THEY USED THE PUTTY IN THE DOORS.
01:11:09.849,01:11:11.809,WHAT DO WE GOT?
01:11:11.809,01:11:15.897,NO. WE GOT A STONE KILLER TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.
01:11:15.897,01:11:18.149,YOU CAN MAKE THE CALL NOW.
01:11:18.149,01:11:20.944,I'M NOT CALLING ANYONE YET.
01:11:20.944,01:11:23.780,YOU CAN'T RUSH THIS.
01:11:23.780,01:11:26.699,I WANNA MAKE SURE THIS TORCH DOESN'T WALK.
01:11:28.618,01:11:29.994,WE'RE GONNA WAIT.
01:11:34.624,01:11:37.627,"WELL, WELL, MR. McCAFFREY."
01:11:37.627,01:11:40.379,WELCOME ABOARD.

01:11:42.715,01:11:46.761,"WELL, NOT YET. GLAD TO HAVE YOU AS PART OF THE TEAM, BRIAN."
01:11:46.761,01:11:49.680,LET'S GET A PICTURE WITH MR. McCAFFREY AND MYSELF.
01:11:52.892,01:11:54.685,YOU LOOK GOOD.
01:11:56.104,01:11:58.856,THANKS.
01:11:58.856,01:12:01.151,"YEAH, HAVE FUN NOW."
01:12:01.151,01:12:03.820,WHO IS THAT?
01:12:03.820,01:12:06.530,LARRY DeWAAY.

01:12:39.022,01:12:40.606,IS RIMGALE GETTING ANY BETTER?
01:12:40.606,01:12:44.027,RIMGALE'S RIMGALE.
01:12:44.027,01:12:46.654,DOING HIS JOB?
01:12:46.654,01:12:49.282,"AT THIS RATE, HE WON'T DECLARE IT'S ARSON BEFORE HE RETIRES."
01:12:55.454,01:12:56.956,WILL YOU GET ME OUT OF HERE?
01:12:56.956,01:12:59.209,OTHERWISE I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO AND PICK HER UP.
01:13:04.214,01:13:08.343,"THIS IS IT, ONE OF THE OLDEST FIRE STATIONS IN THE CITY."

01:13:25.818,01:13:28.029,SEE THOSE DOORS?
01:13:28.029,01:13:31.908,THEY LEAD TO THE HAYLOFT WHEN THEY USED TO HAVE THE OLD HORSE-DRAWN ENGINES.
01:13:31.908,01:13:33.534,LOT DIFFERENT THEN.
01:13:35.745,01:13:37.288,"BUT KIND OF THE SAME, YOU KNOW?"

01:14:08.736,01:14:10.988,I SHOULD HAVE SAID I WANTED TO BE A GOOD ONE.

01:20:48.552,01:20:51.681,"HEY, SHADOW, I GOT ONE HERE."
01:20:53.265,01:20:55.225,SOME GUY NAMED HOLCOMB.
01:21:00.606,01:21:01.816,STEVE.
01:21:03.442,01:21:04.610,STEVE.
01:21:06.069,01:21:07.404,"STEVE, YOU ALL RIGHT?"

01:21:49.196,01:21:50.906,PLEASE STAY OUTSIDE.
01:21:55.870,01:21:57.413,I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.
01:21:57.413,01:21:59.331,"NONE OF US SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE, BRIAN."
01:22:02.334,01:22:04.545,DON'T TELL ME THE CHANCE I'M TAKING!

01:22:15.431,01:22:19.769,"YOU HAD TO BE MYTH MAN, TAKING ANOTHER FIRE BARE-HANDED INSTEAD OF LOOKING OUT FOR YOUR PROBIE."
01:22:19.769,01:22:22.688,IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
01:22:22.688,01:22:24.899,"HE'S A CANDIDATE, YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!"
01:22:24.899,01:22:26.942,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD HIM UP THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
01:22:26.942,01:22:28.944,"YOU BURNED HIM, STEPHEN."
01:22:28.944,01:22:32.030,FUCK YOU.
01:22:45.294,01:22:47.337,"YO, BRIAN!"

01:23:27.169,01:23:30.046,ALDERMAN.
01:23:35.511,01:23:37.137,CHINESE SPONGE CAKE?
01:23:37.137,01:23:39.682,"WHEN ARE YOU GONNA CATCH THE PRICK THAT'S DOING THIS, DON?"
01:23:39.682,01:23:42.893,DON?
01:23:42.893,01:23:44.645,"NO, MARTY, I DON'T."
01:23:45.688,01:23:48.732,WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VICTIMS AT ALL.
01:23:49.984,01:23:52.110,JESUS CHRIST.
01:23:52.110,01:23:54.446,"YOU GOT SEAGRAVE, COSGROVE..."
01:23:54.446,01:23:56.824,AND NOW HOLCOMB.
01:23:56.824,01:23:58.367,PUT 'EM TOGETHER.
01:24:00.118,01:24:02.162,I DIDN'T KNOW THE NAME OF THAT VICTIM HAD BEEN RELEASED YET.
01:24:19.680,01:24:21.932,"HEY, JOHN."
01:24:28.355,01:24:30.273,I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO.
01:24:32.943,01:24:36.405,I WANT TO HELP YOU NAIL THAT SON OF A BITCH THAT BURNED TIM.
01:24:37.865,01:24:39.491,SHOW ME HOW.
01:24:49.835,01:24:52.880,THOUGHT OLD MARTY WAS ACTING A LITTLE STRANGE.
01:24:52.880,01:24:55.966,HE'S RIGHT.
01:24:58.218,01:24:59.803,HOLCOMB IS THE THIRD VICTIM.
01:25:02.848,01:25:05.559,THE BACKDRAFT WAS SET UP SOMEWHERE IN THERE.
01:25:05.559,01:25:08.812,FRIED HOLCOMB WHEN HE OPENED THE INNER DOOR.
01:25:10.439,01:25:13.483,BUT THE OUTER DOOR HELD AND IT WAITED FOR TIM.
01:25:16.862,01:25:18.614,"IN A WORD, BRIAN..."
01:25:20.490,01:25:22.492,WHAT IS THIS JOB ALL ABOUT?
01:25:22.492,01:25:24.202,FIRE.
01:25:41.219,01:25:43.430,"IT'S A LIVING THING, BRIAN."
01:25:43.430,01:25:46.349,"IT BREATHES, IT EATS..."
01:25:47.893,01:25:49.394,AND IT HATES.
01:25:51.313,01:25:53.356,THE ONLY WAY TO BEAT IT...
01:25:53.356,01:26:05.953,"IS TO THINK LIKE IT; TO KNOW THIS FLAME WILL SPREAD THIS WAY ACROSS THE DOOR AND UP ACROSS THE CEILING; NOT BECAUSE OF THE PHYSICS OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS, BUT BECAUSE IT WANTS TO."
01:26:05.953,01:26:11.625,"SOME GUYS ON THIS JOB, FIRE OWNS 'EM, MAKES 'EM FIGHT IT ON ITS LEVEL."
01:26:12.626,01:26:18.298,"THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY KILL IT IS TO LOVE IT A LITTLE, JUST LIKE RONALD."
01:26:34.898,01:26:36.566,HI.
01:26:37.985,01:26:41.571,I HEARD YOUR FRIEND TIM'S GONNA BE OKAY.
01:26:41.571,01:26:47.161,WE CHECKED AND YOUR BOSS WAS PARTNERS WITH ALL THE MURDER VICTIMS IN A COMPANY CALLED LAKESIDE DYNAMICS.
01:26:47.161,01:26:50.580,HE'S KEEPING THAT A SECRET.
01:26:54.376,01:26:57.462,I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
01:26:59.173,01:27:03.010,GET ME HIS FILES.
01:27:03.010,01:27:04.511,YEAH.
01:27:04.511,01:27:07.931,FOUR YEARS AGO I WAS PUNCHING A CASH REGISTER.
01:27:07.931,01:27:10.392,"TWO YEARS AGO, MARTY SWAYZAK DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME."
01:27:10.392,01:27:12.394,I WAS BRINGING THE GUY COFFEE.
01:27:12.394,01:27:15.189,I PRACTICALLY RUN THAT OFFICE NOW.
01:27:15.189,01:27:18.817,AND MARTY-- HE BELIEVES IN ME.
01:27:18.817,01:27:24.948,I JUST DON'T-- YOU'RE ASKING ME TO THROW THAT ALL AWAY.
01:27:24.948,01:27:26.909,"YOUR BOSS IS A LIAR, JENNIFER."
01:27:49.139,01:27:50.515,STEPHEN?
01:27:53.018,01:27:57.147,"I'M SORRY, HELEN."
01:28:00.150,01:28:02.903,"WELL, WHAT'S WRONG?"
01:28:03.987,01:28:06.115,IT USED TO BE REAL CLEAR.
01:28:06.115,01:28:07.908,WHEN I WAS A KID...
01:28:10.244,01:28:13.038,WHAT MEANT MOST TO ME ABOUT THIS JOB WAS...
01:28:14.164,01:28:15.290,NO IFS.
01:28:16.583,01:28:20.087,"SOMEBODY CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, WE CAME."
01:28:20.087,01:28:22.464,WE JUST SHOWED UP.
01:28:27.302,01:28:30.388,"THOSE GUYS, THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE 'EM."
01:28:36.436,01:28:39.231,YOU DON'T LEAVE PEOPLE HANGIN'.
01:28:42.692,01:28:44.778,"IT HOLDS EVERYTHING UP, DOESN'T IT?"
01:28:45.946,01:28:47.072,LOYALTY.
01:28:48.907,01:28:51.743,I DON'T GET IT.
01:28:51.743,01:28:53.578,"ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU HEARD, HELEN?"
01:28:55.038,01:28:57.373,"YOU GO, WE GO."
01:28:58.541,01:29:00.376,"PIECE OF SHIT WITHOUT THAT, ISN'T IT?"
01:29:00.376,01:29:03.088,IT'S THE END OF EVERYTHING.
01:29:10.428,01:29:12.388,I'M SORRY I CAME.
01:29:15.184,01:29:17.644,THERE'S JUST NOBODY I CAN TALK TO.
01:29:25.861,01:29:27.612,I REALLY MISS YOU.
01:30:13.533,01:30:18.163,YOU SURE YOU REALLY WANT TO PUT GRAPE JELLY IN THE EGGS?
01:30:18.163,01:30:22.084,"YEAH, IT'S PART OF MY FORMULA."
01:30:22.084,01:30:24.086,IT'S AN EXPERIMENT?
01:30:24.086,01:30:26.129,LET'S GET THESE EGGS GOING.
01:30:26.129,01:30:28.173,"HEY, I WANT TO DO THAT."
01:30:28.173,01:30:29.258,YEAH.
01:30:30.175,01:30:32.177,THAT'S GOOD.
01:30:32.177,01:30:34.679,THAT IS GOOD.
01:30:34.679,01:30:37.140,I'LL PUT THAT IN THE FORMULA.
01:30:37.140,01:30:39.601,YOU GONNA LEAVE THE SHELLS?
01:30:39.601,01:30:43.688,THEY'RE PART OF THE FORMULA?
01:30:43.688,01:30:45.982,I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
01:30:45.982,01:30:49.819,I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
01:30:49.819,01:30:51.738,MOM!
01:30:51.738,01:30:54.448,I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BE UP SO EARLY.
01:30:54.448,01:30:58.203,"MOM, GO BACK TO BED."
01:31:03.833,01:31:06.836,"STEPHEN, CAN I TALK TO YOU A MINUTE?"
01:31:06.836,01:31:09.298,YOU KEEP GOING THERE.
01:31:09.298,01:31:11.300,HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOIN' IN THERE.
01:31:11.300,01:31:15.971,HE TOLD ME HE LIKES THOSE PIANO LESSONS YOU GOT HIM TAKING.
01:31:15.971,01:31:19.682,"IT'S JUST I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE HIM, YOU KNOW."
01:31:19.682,01:31:23.812,I KNEW WHO YOU WERE WHEN WE GOT MARRIED.
01:31:23.812,01:31:25.688,I KNEW HOW YOU DID THINGS.
01:31:28.566,01:31:37.326,"AND-- I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T-- I JUST CAN'T ANYMORE."
01:31:38.868,01:31:43.039,"I JUST-- YOU KNOW, I GOTTA WORRY ABOUT SEAN."
01:31:44.582,01:31:47.752,YEAH.
01:31:47.752,01:31:50.172,YOU REALLY ARE.
01:31:50.172,01:31:59.139,BUT THE CHANCES THAT YOU TAKE JUST-- YOU SCARE ME NOW.
01:32:08.857,01:32:09.899,SEAN.
01:32:09.899,01:32:14.570,"LISTEN, I, UH-- I BLEW IT."
01:32:14.570,01:32:17.366,I FORGOT THAT I GOTTA WORK THIS MORNING.
01:32:17.366,01:32:21.661,"SO, UM-- THAT'S ALL RIGHT."
01:32:21.661,01:32:23.455,WE'LL JUST DO IT AGAIN NEXT SATURDAY.
01:32:23.455,01:32:26.082,ALL RIGHT?
01:32:41.139,01:32:43.475,"THE LATEST POLLS CAME IN, MARTY."
01:32:47.937,01:32:49.105,MARTY?
01:32:59.199,01:33:01.326,"JESUS CHRIST, MARTY."

01:33:09.543,01:33:10.626,MARTY.
01:33:19.344,01:33:21.263,"YOU'VE GOTTA LEVEL WITH ME, MARTY."
01:33:21.263,01:33:24.640,IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THESE DEATHS YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?
01:33:27.477,01:33:28.728,NO.

01:34:14.732,01:34:17.860,RIMGALE'S GONNA WANT TO TALK TO SWAYZAK ABOUT THIS.
01:34:21.281,01:34:22.407,I'M SORRY.
01:34:24.742,01:34:26.161,THAT'S A DUMB THING TO SAY.
01:34:26.161,01:34:28.330,YOU'RE RIGHT.
01:34:30.540,01:34:32.000,"GOOD-BYE, BRIAN."
01:34:39.508,01:34:41.551,WHAT THE HELL YOU DO WITH THIS THING?
01:34:41.551,01:34:43.928,WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
01:34:43.928,01:34:49.851,THIS IS A COPY OF SWAYZAK'S REPORT THAT WE KNOW IS BULLSHIT; BUT WE COULD NEVER ARGUE WITH THE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY'RE AIRTIGHT.
01:34:49.851,01:34:52.646,THIS FILE SHE GAVE YOU PROVES IT'S PHONY.
01:34:52.646,01:34:56.358,I CHECKED ON THE ACCOUNTING FIRM THAT RECOMMENDED THE CUTS TO SWAYZAK'S TASK FORCE.
01:34:56.358,01:34:58.860,THEY'VE DONE EXACTLY ONE JOB: A MANPOWER STUDY.
01:34:58.860,01:35:01.946,I CHECKED FURTHER AND IT'S NOT EVEN A COMPANY.
01:35:01.946,01:35:05.116,JUST A P.O. BOX.
01:35:05.116,01:35:08.662,IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK NUMBERS.
01:35:08.662,01:35:10.830,LIKE A BUNCH OF DEAD FINANCIAL WIZARDS.
01:35:12.457,01:35:16.336,"SEAGRAVE, HOLCOMB, COSGROVE -- AND SWAYZAK."
01:35:16.336,01:35:19.381,WHY DID HE GO THROUGH THIS TROUBLE TO CUT FIREHOUSES?
01:35:19.381,01:35:23.218,"WHEN A FIREHOUSE CLOSES, SWAYZAK CONVERTS IT INTO A COMMUNITY CENTER."
01:35:23.218,01:35:25.887,THAT'S SWEET.
01:35:25.887,01:35:28.223,THEY GET ALL THE EXPENSIVE CONSTRUCTION WORK.
01:35:28.223,01:35:30.392,"I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM."
01:35:30.392,01:35:32.143,THESE GUYS WERE MAKING A TON OF MONEY.
01:35:33.811,01:35:37.899,IT'S TIME WE HAD A LITTLE TALK WITH MR. SWAYZAK. LET'S GO.
01:35:57.627,01:35:59.087,MR. SWAYZAK?
01:36:04.884,01:36:06.969,GAS.
01:36:25.739,01:36:27.532,AAH!
01:36:51.556,01:36:54.142,COME ON.
01:37:08.782,01:37:12.160,LET'S GO.
01:37:39.729,01:37:42.482,I THINK I'VE GOT A PROBLEM HERE.
01:37:48.029,01:37:50.031,ALDERMAN. ALDERMAN.
01:37:50.031,01:37:53.034,IS IT TRUE THAT YOU WERE RESCUED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S ARSON TEAM?
01:37:53.034,01:37:55.995,"THAT'S QUITE A BUNCH OF GUYS, HUH? YEAH."
01:37:58.039,01:38:01.459,I'M SO GODDAMN HELPLESS HERE.
01:38:01.459,01:38:03.919,I CAN'T DO A FUCKING THING.
01:38:07.298,01:38:08.675,WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
01:38:08.675,01:38:14.723,"I'VE BEEN LYING HERE-- BEEN THINKIN' FOR HOURS... THINKIN', AND THINKIN', AND THINKIN'."
01:38:16.599,01:38:19.561,WE'RE CLOSE.
01:38:19.561,01:38:24.482,"BUT WE'RE NOT LOOKIN' IN THE RIGHT PLACE, BRIAN, NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACE."
01:38:27.694,01:38:32.866,"SO, YOU'VE COME TO PICK RONALD'S BRAINS..."
01:38:32.866,01:38:37.203,BECAUSE NOBODY KNOWS THE ANIMAL LIKE RONALD.
01:38:44.001,01:38:46.796,IT MUST'VE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE...
01:38:46.796,01:38:50.717,"A MEDIUM DEAL, DIDN'T IT, WHEN YOUR FATHER BOUGHT IT?"
01:38:50.717,01:38:53.094,WHAT?
01:38:53.094,01:39:02.186,"DID YOU WATCH HIM WHEN HE MADE THAT BALLSY JUMP AND SAVED-- I DIDN'T COME TO TALK ABOUT MY FATHER, OKAY?"
01:39:02.186,01:39:08.443,"YEAH, I SENT AWAY FOR A COPY OF THAT LIFE MAGAZINE WITH YOUR PICTURE ON THE COVER."
01:39:08.443,01:39:09.819,IT'S A COLLECTIBLE.
01:39:09.819,01:39:12.864,"WHO'S DOING THIS, RONALD?"
01:39:12.864,01:39:15.324,WHO ISN'T?
01:39:15.324,01:39:18.286,"IT ISN'T A SPARK, IS IT?"
01:39:15.324,01:39:20.079,BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DAMAGE AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD ANY FUN.
01:39:20.079,01:39:23.625,IT ISN'T AN INSURANCE PRO BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY PROFIT.
01:39:23.625,01:39:26.669,WHO DOES THAT LEAVE US WITH?
01:39:26.669,01:39:30.757,HOW DOES HE DO IT?
01:39:30.757,01:39:34.051,THE OUTLETS.

01:40:50.252,01:40:53.840,"FUCK YOU, RONALD!"
01:40:54.841,01:40:56.551,DID IT LOOK AT YOU?
01:40:58.970,01:41:00.889,Did the fire look at you?
01:41:04.726,01:41:05.935,It did.
01:41:17.363,01:41:19.114,OH.
01:41:19.114,01:41:21.074,OHH.
01:41:24.370,01:41:27.707,"OUR WORLDS AREN'T THAT FAR APART AFTER ALL, ARE THEY?"
01:41:29.375,01:41:30.459,SO...
01:41:32.003,01:41:36.257,"WHOEVER DID THIS REALLY KNOWS THE ANIMAL WELL, DON'T THEY?"
01:41:37.508,01:41:41.054,THEY KNOW HIM REAL WELL BUT THEY WON'T LET HIM LOOSE.
01:41:41.054,01:41:43.848,THEY WON'T LET HIM HAVE FUN SO THEY DON'T LOVE HIM.
01:41:43.848,01:41:45.558,WHO DOESN'T LOVE FIRE...
01:41:47.060,01:41:50.438,AND IS AROUND TRYCHTICHLORATE ALL DAY LONG?
01:41:50.438,01:41:52.273,"OH, MY GOD!"
01:41:58.029,01:42:01.824,"THAT WASN'T SUCH A LONG WALK AFTER ALL, WAS IT?"
01:42:15.671,01:42:17.882,"OH, GOD."
