00:00:14.160,00:00:15.840,Where are you going?
00:00:16.080,00:00:17.920,They have asked for her.
00:00:05.680,00:00:07.640,"Hurry, or they'll kill us all!"
00:00:08.160,00:00:09.200,Hurry!
00:00:12.320,00:00:13.880,Do your breasts still give milk?
00:00:13.960,00:00:16.160,Where are you going?
00:00:16.239,00:00:17.800,They have asked for her.
00:01:24.400,00:01:26.160,Sir? This is her.
00:01:27.800,00:01:29.560,The girl who tells fortunes?
00:02:02.360,00:02:05.800,They're doing a magic spell to make it win a race.
00:02:12.680,00:02:14.960,The horse's name is Meaghan Boy.
00:02:15.040,00:02:17.560,"Kemp ton, 3:00, Monday."
00:02:17.640,00:02:21.120,You ladies have a bet yourselves but don't tell anyone else.
00:02:49.400,00:02:54.080,but it was good because God resided there with him.
00:02:54.160,00:03:00.880,"You see, children, God does not care if you live in a slum or in a mansion."
00:03:00.960,00:03:05.360,God does not care if you are rich or you are poor.
00:03:05.440,00:03:07.800,You are still...
00:03:13.920,00:03:15.120,"Morning, sir."
00:04:34.200,00:04:35.920,Arthur's mad as hell.
00:04:39.800,00:04:42.400,"What does a ten-year-old know about hell, eh?"
00:04:42.480,00:04:44.000,I'm 11 Sunday.
00:05:29.400,00:05:30.760,- Just look. - Tommy!
00:05:30.840,00:05:33.200,"- All on Meaghan Boy. - Good work, John."
00:05:33.280,00:05:34.480,Tommy!
00:05:34.560,00:05:36.760,"Get in here, now!"
00:05:37.360,00:05:41.240,"That'll be six pennies, Nipper. That's ten bob you'll see for that."
00:05:49.800,00:05:54.360,You was seen doing the powder trick down at Garrison Courts.
00:05:55.000,00:05:56.640,Times are hard.
00:05:56.920,00:05:59.040,People need a reason to lay a bet.
00:05:59.200,00:06:01.000,There was a Chinese.
00:06:01.080,00:06:03.400,The washer women say she's a witch.
00:06:03.960,00:06:05.360,It helps them believe.
00:06:05.440,00:06:07.280,We don't mess with Chinese.
00:06:07.360,00:06:11.880,- Look at the book-- - Chinese have cutters of their own.
00:06:11.960,00:06:13.480,"We agreed, Arthur."
00:06:14.240,00:06:16.960,I'm taking charge of drumming up new money.
00:06:19.480,00:06:21.480,"What if Meaghan Boy wins, Tommy?"
00:06:22.360,00:06:24.280,You fixing races now?
00:06:24.360,00:06:28.720,"Do you have permission from Billy Kimber to be fixing races, mm?"
00:06:29.720,00:06:31.760,What's got into you?
00:06:32.520,00:06:37.120,You think we can take on the Chinese and Billy Kimber.
00:06:37.200,00:06:41.680,"- Billy's got a bloody army-- - I think, Arthur."
00:06:42.240,00:06:43.840,That's what I do.
00:06:47.280,00:06:48.680,I think.
00:06:49.880,00:06:52.120,So that you don't have to.
00:06:56.040,00:06:57.760,There's news from Belfast.
00:07:03.600,00:07:06.600,I'm calling a family council tonight at 8:00.
00:07:06.680,00:07:08.280,I want all of us there.
00:07:08.840,00:07:10.320,You hear me?
00:07:10.400,00:07:12.080,There's trouble coming.
00:08:11.440,00:08:13.680,"All right, shut up now. Shut up."
00:08:15.760,00:08:20.080,"Comrades, we're here today to take a vote on strike action."
00:08:22.200,00:08:28.680,"But before we have a show of hands for that, let's have a show of hands from all those who fought in France."
00:08:28.760,00:08:33.880,All those who stood side by side with your comrades and watched your comrades fall.
00:08:34.360,00:08:35.679,Raise your hands.
00:08:40.159,00:08:46.000,"The blood shed on Flanders Fields, the sweat of your brows..."
00:08:46.920,00:08:49.160,Who reaps the rewards?
00:08:51.720,00:08:54.040,- Is it your wives? - No!
00:08:54.120,00:08:57.040,"- Who, then, do they stand among us? - No!"
00:08:57.120,00:09:05.120,Or do they sit at home comfortable with a full belly while you scrape to find enough to put shoes on your children's feet!
00:09:06.320,00:09:10.000,And what is the reward they offer you for your sacrifices made?
00:09:10.480,00:09:12.920,A fucking cut in your wages.
00:09:13.000,00:09:14.840,That is your reward.
00:09:15.200,00:09:17.680,"Raise a hand, all those who want to strike."
00:10:12.840,00:10:14.400,"On the house, Mr. Shelby."
00:10:56.840,00:11:00.080,"Cheers, Thomas, good health to you."
00:11:06.240,00:11:08.080,The crown of a prince.
00:11:11.400,00:11:12.920,"Soon to be king, I'd bet."
00:11:13.000,00:11:14.280,You don't bet.
00:11:14.640,00:11:17.960,"No, but these past few days I've been speculating."
00:11:21.640,00:11:22.920,About what?
00:11:23.760,00:11:29.200,One of my Union comrades has a sister who works in the telegraph office at the BSA factory.
00:11:29.280,00:11:36.160,"She says, over the past week they've had messages coming up from London to the brass, from Winston Churchill himself."
00:11:40.960,00:11:42.640,Something about a robbery.
00:11:43.840,00:11:46.560,"A robbery of national significance, it said."
00:11:49.120,00:11:52.840,She found a list of names left on the telegraph machine.
00:11:54.640,00:11:57.960,And on that list was your name and my name together.
00:12:00.440,00:12:06.040,What kind of a list would have the name of a communist and the name of a bookmaker side by side?
00:12:09.000,00:12:12.800,Perhaps it's a list of men who give false hope to the poor.
00:12:13.960,00:12:20.400,"The only difference between you and me, Freddie, is that sometimes my horses stand a chance of winning."
00:12:28.200,00:12:35.640,"You know, there are days when I hear about the cuttings and beatings that I really wish I'd let you take that bullet in France."
00:12:36.320,00:12:39.440,"Believe me, there are nights I wish you had."
00:12:42.600,00:12:43.640,Hey!
00:12:47.880,00:12:50.120,- They're going to get me! - On three.
00:12:50.200,00:12:53.200,"- They are going to get me! - One, two, three, down!"
00:12:53.280,00:12:56.360,"- Breathe, Danny, breathe. - They're going to get me!"
00:12:56.440,00:12:57.960,They're going to get me!
00:12:58.040,00:13:01.120,"Danny. Danny. Danny, you're home."
00:13:01.200,00:13:04.400,We're all home in England. You are not in France.
00:13:04.480,00:13:07.480,"You're not an artillery shell, Danny, you're a man."
00:13:07.560,00:13:08.800,Hey?
00:13:08.880,00:13:11.960,"You're not a whiz-bang. You're a human being, Danny."
00:13:12.040,00:13:13.600,You're all right.
00:13:13.680,00:13:15.160,You're all right.
00:13:15.240,00:13:16.480,You're all right.
00:13:16.840,00:13:18.520,Up! Up!
00:13:22.360,00:13:24.000,It's all right.
00:13:24.360,00:13:25.680,It's all right.
00:13:28.440,00:13:29.920,Ah! Hell!
00:13:30.000,00:13:31.560,Did I do it again?
00:13:32.840,00:13:34.280,"You did it again, Danny."
00:13:37.880,00:13:39.800,"You got to stop doing this, man."
00:13:40.440,00:13:43.400,"- It's all right. - Oh, God! Mr. Shelby, I'm sorry."
00:13:43.480,00:13:46.520,"It's all right. You go home to your wife now, Danny."
00:13:46.600,00:13:49.880,"Try and get all that smoke and mud out of your head, eh?"
00:13:49.960,00:13:51.720,"Yes, Mr. Shelby. I'm sorry."
00:13:53.160,00:13:54.440,Go on.
00:13:58.560,00:14:01.320,"Mr. Shelby, you have to do something about him."
00:14:01.400,00:14:02.480,"Damn right, Harry."
00:14:02.560,00:14:05.880,You pay the Peaky Blinders a lot of money for protection.
00:14:06.360,00:14:09.280,"You're the law around here now, Tommy, aren't you?"
00:14:09.360,00:14:14.480,Maybe you should put a bullet in Danny Whiz-Bang's head like they do with mad horses.
00:14:16.040,00:14:19.440,"Maybe you'll have to put a bullet in my head someday, too."
00:14:29.400,00:14:31.560,Bring the bill to the Peaky Blinders.
00:14:31.640,00:14:33.000,We'll take care of it.
00:14:52.680,00:14:54.200,Look at the gun.
00:14:55.680,00:14:57.120,You recognize it?
00:14:57.360,00:14:58.400,Mmm.
00:15:00.560,00:15:02.720,"Get up off your ass, you umping pig."
00:15:02.800,00:15:05.440,Aunt Poll! What the fuck did you do that for?
00:15:05.520,00:15:08.640,"Finn was playing with this, this afternoon by the Cut."
00:15:08.720,00:15:11.160,It was loaded. Nearly blew Ada's tits off.
00:15:11.240,00:15:13.160,It must've fell out of my pocket.
00:15:13.240,00:15:17.720,"He said he found it on the sideboard of the betting shop, with bullets in it."
00:15:18.200,00:15:19.880,I... I must have been drunk.
00:15:21.560,00:15:23.000,When are you not drunk?
00:15:23.080,00:15:25.120,"Look, Aunt Pol. I'm sorry."
00:15:25.680,00:15:27.800,I'm... I'm sorry.
00:15:28.880,00:15:33.520,"Keep this between ourselves, if you swear not to leave guns lying around."
00:15:36.960,00:15:42.880,"Look, I know having four kids without a woman is hard, but my boot is harder. Now come on, we're late."
00:15:46.760,00:15:49.160,because I've got some very important news.
00:15:49.680,00:15:53.000,Scud boat and Love lock got back from Belfast last night.
00:15:53.720,00:15:56.600,They were buying a stallion to cover their mares.
00:15:56.840,00:16:04.960,"They were in a pub on Shank hill Road yesterday and in that pub there was a copper, handing out these."
00:16:07.920,00:16:11.480,"If you're over five feet and can fight, come to Birmingham."
00:16:12.360,00:16:16.680,They're recruiting Protestant Irishmen to come over here as Specials.
00:16:19.800,00:16:21.520,He's the Chief Inspector.
00:16:22.240,00:16:25.960,The last four years he's been clearing the IRA out of Belfast.
00:16:26.160,00:16:28.120,How do you know so bloody much?
00:16:28.200,00:16:30.640,'Cause I asked the coppers on our payroll.
00:16:30.720,00:16:32.200,Why didn't you tell me?
00:16:34.280,00:16:35.840,I'm telling you.
00:16:37.920,00:16:40.000,Why send him to Birmingham?
00:16:40.120,00:16:44.360,"There's been all these strikes at the BSA, and the Austin works lately."
00:16:44.800,00:16:48.480,Now the papers are talking about sedition. And revolution.
00:16:49.240,00:16:51.320,I reckon it's communists he's after.
00:16:51.400,00:16:54.080,"So this copper is gonna leave us alone, right?"
00:16:54.160,00:16:58.360,There are Irishmen in Green Lanes who left Belfast to get away from him.
00:16:58.440,00:17:01.240,Catholic men who crossed him used to disappear.
00:17:01.320,00:17:05.680,"Yeah, but we ain't IRA. We bloody fought for the King."
00:17:05.760,00:17:07.520,"Anyway, we're Peaky Blinders."
00:17:07.599,00:17:10.160,- We're not scared of coppers. - He's right.
00:17:10.240,00:17:13.079,"If they come for us, we'll cut them a smile each."
00:17:13.160,00:17:14.920,"So, Arthur, is that it?"
00:17:18.079,00:17:20.079,This family does everything open.
00:17:21.040,00:17:24.079,"You have nothing more to say to this meeting, Thomas?"
00:17:24.160,00:17:25.240,No.
00:17:25.319,00:17:27.240,Nothing that's women's business.
00:17:27.319,00:17:32.120,This whole bloody enterprise was women's business while you boys were away at war.
00:17:32.200,00:17:33.360,What's changed?
00:17:34.440,00:17:35.720,We came back.
00:17:36.360,00:17:41.240,And the Lord will smite the unholy when the great judgment comes.
00:17:41.320,00:17:43.720,"And judgment is coming, my friends."
00:17:43.800,00:17:46.960,Judgment is coming to this wicked city.
00:17:47.040,00:17:51.880,And your wickedness and your fornication will be revealed.
00:17:51.960,00:17:54.880,You cannot hide from the Creator.
00:17:54.960,00:17:58.920,You cannot hide from the Almighty himself.
00:17:59.000,00:18:01.120,The Creator sees all.
00:18:01.200,00:18:04.680,You cannot hide from the true and living God.
00:18:16.080,00:18:17.560,Fuck off!
00:18:30.920,00:18:32.960,"That's it, I don't go any further."
00:18:50.000,00:18:52.160,I have ten minutes. What do you want?
00:18:57.200,00:18:58.680,An explanation.
00:19:02.400,00:19:05.800,I've always been able to tell when you're hiding something.
00:19:07.760,00:19:09.240,People round here talk.
00:19:10.280,00:19:12.320,Some of them work at the BSA.
00:19:12.840,00:19:15.400,I've been talking to wives of factory hands.
00:19:15.480,00:19:18.960,Detectives have been asking questions in the proofing shops.
00:19:20.040,00:19:23.640,Nothing happens in that factory without you knowing about it.
00:19:24.480,00:19:25.880,Speak.
00:19:26.440,00:19:28.360,God and Aunt Polly are listening.
00:19:38.720,00:19:40.560,It was meant to be routine.
00:19:43.240,00:19:46.760,I had a buyer in London for some motorcycles.
00:19:47.320,00:19:51.080,I asked my men to steal me four bikes with petrol engines.
00:19:53.000,00:19:55.320,I'm guessing my men were drunk.
00:19:55.800,00:19:59.080,There's a still inside the factory makes tram line gin.
00:20:02.880,00:20:05.480,They picked up the wrong fucking crate.
00:20:06.440,00:20:09.640,The boys dropped it to Charlie Strong's yard as agreed.
00:20:10.160,00:20:14.280,They must've taken it from the proofing bay instead of the export bay.
00:20:19.960,00:20:22.520,Holy sweet baby of Mary.
00:20:22.600,00:20:33.200,"Inside we found 25 Lewis machine guns, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 50 semi-automatic rifles, 200 pistols with shells."
00:20:35.640,00:20:37.400,All bound for Libya.
00:20:38.760,00:20:41.360,Sitting right there in Charlie Strong's yard.
00:20:44.440,00:20:46.440,Tell me you threw them in the Cut.
00:20:47.360,00:20:49.840,We put them in the stables out of the rain.
00:20:49.920,00:20:52.040,The guns hadn't been greased yet.
00:20:56.560,00:20:59.320,So that's why they sent a copper from Belfast.
00:20:59.760,00:21:01.600,Maybe. Maybe not.
00:21:03.720,00:21:08.360,"Thomas, you're a bookmaker, a robber, a fighting man, you are not a fool."
00:21:08.440,00:21:12.280,"You sell those guns to anyone who has use for them, you will hang."
00:21:18.000,00:21:20.600,Dump them somewhere the police can find them.
00:21:20.680,00:21:25.440,"Maybe if they know they haven't fallen into the wrong hands, this might blow over."
00:21:25.880,00:21:28.320,- Tell Charlie to dump them tonight. - No.
00:21:29.000,00:21:31.520,He won't move contraband under a full moon.
00:21:31.760,00:21:34.120,Three days until it wanes.
00:21:34.400,00:21:36.280,Then you'll do the right thing?
00:21:39.120,00:21:43.240,"You have your mother's common sense, but your father's devilment."
00:21:44.120,00:21:45.560,I see them fighting.
00:21:46.720,00:21:48.160,Let your mother win.
00:22:38.000,00:22:39.960,I got tickets for the Penny Crush.
00:22:40.040,00:22:42.480,They're showing a Tom Mix picture.
00:22:42.600,00:22:45.000,"I'm not in the mood for pictures, Ada."
00:22:45.080,00:22:47.040,"Well, I'm not doing it here again."
00:22:47.120,00:22:48.920,I got covered in mud last time.
00:22:49.000,00:22:50.320,Let's just walk a bit.
00:22:50.400,00:22:53.440,"If we go down as far as Greet, we could go to a pub."
00:22:53.520,00:22:55.720,Your brothers have friends in Greet.
00:22:55.800,00:22:58.280,Everywhere. We'd have to walk to London.
00:22:58.360,00:23:01.320,You're the only man around here not scared of them.
00:23:01.440,00:23:03.880,"Oh, I'm scared of them all right."
00:23:03.960,00:23:06.920,"But you love me more than you fear them, right?"
00:23:08.200,00:23:10.560,I don't want to be always sneaking about.
00:23:11.400,00:23:13.760,"- Soon, we'll tell them. - When?"
00:23:18.120,00:23:19.920,How did the family meeting go?
00:23:22.920,00:23:24.040,Usual.
00:23:24.640,00:23:27.000,- There's a new copper coming. - I heard.
00:23:27.080,00:23:30.480,Mmm. And Tommy says he's after the likes of you.
00:23:30.560,00:23:34.600,So maybe you should burn your books and stop making speeches.
00:23:35.240,00:23:37.120,"Oh, my Ada."
00:23:37.200,00:23:41.160,The only princess of the royal family of the kingdom of Small Heath.
00:23:41.720,00:23:44.520,I'm just a poor communist frog with a big mouth.
00:24:34.000,00:24:36.320,I'm here about the job as a barmaid.
00:24:39.080,00:24:41.320,- Are you mad? - Am I what?
00:24:41.400,00:24:43.080,Do you know about this place?
00:24:43.160,00:24:45.240,I saw it in an advertisement.
00:24:45.320,00:24:46.400,Job's been filled.
00:24:46.480,00:24:48.320,But it was in yesterday's paper.
00:24:48.400,00:24:51.320,"Believe me, love, I'm doing you a favor."
00:24:51.400,00:24:55.040,"I'm not asking for favors, I'm asking for employment."
00:24:57.680,00:25:00.400,You're too... nice.
00:25:01.360,00:25:03.560,- How would you know? - Too pretty.
00:25:04.320,00:25:06.320,They'd have you up against a wall.
00:25:06.560,00:25:08.040,I have experience.
00:25:08.440,00:25:09.920,And references.
00:25:14.720,00:25:16.680,What part of Ireland are you from?
00:25:17.040,00:25:18.680,- Galway. - Ah.
00:25:19.480,00:25:20.640,I worked in Dublin.
00:25:21.800,00:25:23.480,My mother was from Galway.
00:25:26.920,00:25:29.840,- You are too pretty. - Watch.
00:25:30.840,00:25:32.080,And listen.
00:25:34.200,00:25:37.040,? I wish I was ?
00:25:37.240,00:25:41.080,? In Carrickfergus ?
00:25:41.200,00:25:43.520,? Only for nights ?
00:25:43.600,00:25:46.200,? In Ballygrand ?
00:25:46.280,00:25:49.840,? I would swim over ?
00:25:49.920,00:25:52.920,? The deepest ocean ?
00:25:53.520,00:25:55.680,? The deepest ocean ?
00:25:55.760,00:25:58.280,? For my love to find ?
00:25:59.040,00:26:02.160,? My boyhood friends ?
00:26:02.240,00:26:05.160,? And my own relations ?
00:26:05.240,00:26:08.000,? Have all passed on now ?
00:26:08.080,00:26:10.720,? Like the melting snow ?
00:26:15.920,00:26:20.160,In Ireland my singing made them cry and stopped them fighting.
00:26:21.800,00:26:23.680,I hope you know a lot of songs.
00:27:13.120,00:27:14.160,Babies.
00:27:15.680,00:27:20.160,Discarded with the fish bones and eggshells.
00:27:22.040,00:27:23.320,Girls.
00:27:24.760,00:27:26.400,11 years old.
00:27:27.800,00:27:32.440,Pierced and punctured by old men for three pence a time.
00:27:33.000,00:27:35.280,Rutted upon like animals.
00:27:36.760,00:27:38.360,Degradation.
00:27:39.320,00:27:44.160,"Fathers with their daughters, brothers and sisters sharing beds."
00:27:44.920,00:27:47.920,Beggars and thieves left to run in the streets.
00:27:48.840,00:27:57.480,"And astride the whole stinking pile of wounds and rotten flesh, your masters."
00:27:58.680,00:28:01.520,The men who you touch your cap to.
00:28:03.680,00:28:05.600,The Peaky Blinders.
00:28:07.840,00:28:17.200,"The vicious, merciless gangs who blind those who see and cut out the tongues of those who talk."
00:28:18.800,00:28:21.120,You are worse than them.
00:28:24.320,00:28:28.240,Those of you who have taken their bribes these years since the war.
00:28:28.560,00:28:35.120,"Those of you who have looked the other way, you are worse than them."
00:28:37.320,00:28:40.680,God damn you for soiling your uniforms!
00:28:44.200,00:28:51.000,"And then, there are t he IRA Fenians and the communists."
00:28:51.960,00:28:53.880,Blacker hearts still.
00:28:54.640,00:29:00.880,They feed on the puss of all this corruption like maggots in a corpse!
00:29:02.160,00:29:13.240,And like maggots have left a swell they will eventually swarm like flies and spread their rotten philosophy across the country and across the world.
00:29:13.640,00:29:15.160,Those then...
00:29:16.560,00:29:18.080,are our enemies.
00:29:19.760,00:29:21.760,A three-headed beast.
00:29:21.880,00:29:27.040,"It is my job to decapitate each one, and by God I will do it."
00:29:30.640,00:29:36.720,I don't trust any of you until you earn my trust...
00:29:38.920,00:29:40.920,and that takes some earning.
00:29:45.200,00:29:49.000,These are the new men who will bolster your ranks.
00:29:51.040,00:29:55.000,Good men from God-fearing families.
00:29:57.280,00:30:02.280,"By the time the sun sets, they will be sworn in and in uniform."
00:30:02.360,00:30:06.280,"And by sunrise tomorrow, they will be on the streets."
00:30:10.160,00:30:13.040,God help those who stand in our way.
00:30:19.800,00:30:22.400,- Right. - Get out of the way for Mr. Shelby.
00:30:26.680,00:30:28.240,"You see, ladies?"
00:30:28.320,00:30:31.760,"When you're out with a Blinder, you don't have to queue."
00:30:36.040,00:30:41.800,"Right, I want a blow job off both of you before they let the ordinary people in."
00:30:41.880,00:30:44.120,Away you go. Take it out.
00:30:44.200,00:30:45.440,What the fuck?
00:30:46.160,00:30:48.320,Who the fuck are you?
00:30:48.880,00:30:51.080,I am Arthur fucking Shelby!
00:31:16.280,00:31:20.360,Lead pack dog of the Peaky Blinders.
00:31:32.000,00:31:33.360,Look at me.
00:32:03.560,00:32:05.240,"Terrifying, I'm sure."
00:32:08.800,00:32:11.160,Knife in his sock. Cosh in his belt.
00:32:16.000,00:32:17.520,"Now, Mr. Shelby..."
00:32:19.320,00:32:23.760,I want you to see this as me introducing myself to you.
00:32:24.280,00:32:25.520,Understand?
00:32:26.440,00:32:32.000,"In all the world, the only thing that interests me is the truth."
00:32:33.280,00:32:34.440,So...
00:32:36.800,00:32:38.800,What do you know about the robbery?
00:32:39.840,00:32:40.960,What robbery?
00:32:50.320,00:32:51.920,I will ask you again.
00:32:53.480,00:32:56.760,What do you know about the robbery?
00:32:56.840,00:33:00.680,"I swear to God, I don't know what you're talking about."
00:33:00.760,00:33:02.880,What fucking robbery?
00:33:14.360,00:33:23.520,"After 35 years of dealing with animals like you, I can tell just by sniffing the air whether or not you are lying."
00:33:25.240,00:33:27.800,I'm not fucking lying! All right?
00:33:27.880,00:33:29.400,I'm not fucking lying.
00:33:38.240,00:33:39.280,I know.
00:33:44.280,00:33:47.520,I see nothing of interest behind the blood in your eyes.
00:33:48.800,00:33:55.880,And no blood in your veins that could carry even a trace of cunning or guile.
00:33:57.800,00:33:59.360,But understand this.
00:34:01.560,00:34:11.719,It is well within my power to have you and the rest of your scum family face down in the canal before the year is out.
00:34:15.239,00:34:16.920,On the other hand...
00:34:20.600,00:34:22.159,we can help each other.
00:34:38.760,00:34:41.480,No. These boys are on their way to St. Andrews.
00:34:41.600,00:34:43.400,- Pray? - That'll be the day!
00:34:43.480,00:34:46.760,St. Andrews is a football ground. The Blues are playing.
00:34:46.840,00:34:51.000,"That's the forward line there and that's the goalie, believe it or not."
00:34:56.880,00:34:58.280,I need a bottle of rum.
00:34:58.360,00:35:00.720,"Grace? Whatever it is, it's on the house."
00:35:00.800,00:35:02.280,- A whole bottle? - Yeah.
00:35:02.360,00:35:04.320,- White or dark rum? - Don't care.
00:35:08.000,00:35:09.080,Thank you.
00:35:11.560,00:35:13.280,Harry said it's on the house.
00:35:15.400,00:35:16.600,Are you a whore?
00:35:20.600,00:35:23.440,"Because if you're not, you're in the wrong place."
00:35:29.640,00:35:31.800,He's one of them you warned me about.
00:35:31.880,00:35:34.880,"Grace, you're a friendly girl, but be careful."
00:35:34.960,00:35:39.480,"If I say something's on the house, then say nothing to whoever you're serving."
00:35:39.560,00:35:44.000,If they decide that they want you there's nothing anybody could do about it.
00:35:44.080,00:35:49.680,"Lucky for you, since he got back from France, Tommy doesn't want anybody at all. Yes, lads?"
00:35:52.680,00:35:55.720,- Wipe the blood out of his eye. - You give orders?
00:35:55.800,00:35:57.040,I'm a trained nurse.
00:35:57.120,00:35:59.320,"Don't make me laugh, it hurts my face."
00:36:00.960,00:36:05.480,You went to one class in the church hall and got thrown out for giggling.
00:36:05.560,00:36:07.760,Not before I learned to stop choking.
00:36:07.840,00:36:09.800,"I'm not bloody choking, am I?"
00:36:09.920,00:36:13.000,You will be when I wrap this cloth round your neck.
00:36:13.120,00:36:16.480,"Let me see him. Well, have this."
00:36:19.720,00:36:20.800,Give me that.
00:36:25.760,00:36:27.000,You're all right.
00:36:29.200,00:36:31.880,He said Mr. Churchill sent him to Birmingham.
00:36:33.440,00:36:35.160,"National interest, he said."
00:36:35.720,00:36:37.400,Something about a robbery.
00:36:41.240,00:36:43.080,He said he wants us to help him.
00:36:43.160,00:36:44.480,We don't help coppers.
00:36:44.560,00:36:46.600,He knew all about our war records.
00:36:47.600,00:36:50.800,He said we're patriots like him.
00:36:51.880,00:36:54.880,He wants us to be his eyes and ears.
00:36:56.800,00:36:58.080,I said...
00:37:00.360,00:37:05.000,I said we'd have a family meeting and take a vote.
00:37:12.480,00:37:14.440,"Well, why not? Mmm?"
00:37:15.120,00:37:18.200,We have no truck with Fenians or communists.
00:37:23.440,00:37:24.880,What's wrong with you?
00:37:26.240,00:37:28.680,What the fuck is wrong with him lately?
00:37:28.760,00:37:31.760,"If I knew, I'd buy the cure from Compton's chemists."
00:37:33.480,00:37:36.600,? I am just a young girl ?
00:37:36.680,00:37:39.400,? I have just come over ?
00:37:39.480,00:37:41.880,? Over from the country ?
00:37:41.960,00:37:45.080,? Where they do things big ?
00:37:45.520,00:37:48.200,? And amongst the boys ?
00:37:48.280,00:37:51.880,? I have got myself a lover ?
00:37:51.960,00:37:55.640,? And since I have a lover ?
00:37:55.720,00:37:58.960,? I don't care a thing ?
00:37:59.040,00:38:04.840,? The boy I love is up in the gallery ?
00:38:04.920,00:38:08.880,? The boy I love is looking at me ?
00:38:13.560,00:38:16.840,? Waving his handkerchief ?
00:38:16.920,00:38:20.360,? As merry as a robin ?
00:38:20.440,00:38:23.040,? That sings on the tree ?
00:38:31.360,00:38:33.960,We haven't had singing in here since the war.
00:38:35.280,00:38:37.160,"Why do you think that is, Harry?"
00:39:10.840,00:39:12.440,So did Arthur say...
00:39:14.280,00:39:17.080,what kind of a deal this new copper offered him?
00:39:17.160,00:39:21.240,"God. The second your balls are empty, it's back onto politics."
00:39:29.760,00:39:31.080,What did Tommy say?
00:39:31.160,00:39:33.960,He didn't say anything. You know what he's like.
00:39:34.040,00:39:35.640,"Yeah, I know what he's like."
00:39:35.720,00:39:38.080,He likes to take his fights onto the mud.
00:39:38.160,00:39:40.080,Doesn't like to stand and wait.
00:39:40.160,00:39:42.920,You know what he'd do if he found out about us.
00:39:43.000,00:39:43.960,He could try.
00:39:44.040,00:39:47.280,Sometimes it's like you're with me just to show you can.
00:39:51.240,00:39:54.240,One day me and Tommy will be on the same side again.
00:41:23.240,00:41:24.280,Danny!
00:42:16.880,00:42:19.560,"Hey, what you do? We're closed."
00:42:20.400,00:42:21.560,Go home!
00:42:22.760,00:42:26.320,"Go home, crazy man. I said, go home, crazy man!"
00:42:30.000,00:42:33.160,"- I said, go home. - Fix bayonets!"
00:43:07.840,00:43:10.960,"Secretary of State, this is Chief Inspector Campbell."
00:43:16.280,00:43:17.720,"Mr. Churchill, sir."
00:43:18.520,00:43:21.320,May I say what a great honor it is to meet you.
00:43:21.400,00:43:23.840,Bit of a whistle stop tour.
00:43:23.920,00:43:26.000,"Love the hat, by the way."
00:43:26.080,00:43:27.160,Thank you.
00:43:28.440,00:43:29.720,It's beaver.
00:43:31.360,00:43:33.640,"So, how are you settling in?"
00:43:35.000,00:43:36.840,I have set up a command network.
00:43:36.920,00:43:41.400,I have agents in place across the city who will act as my eyes and ears.
00:43:42.360,00:43:46.360,And I have begun to interrogate suspects vigorously.
00:43:47.640,00:43:49.480,You were in Belfast.
00:43:49.800,00:43:52.840,I understand you broke a few Fenian hearts.
00:43:54.160,00:43:55.440,"A rat's nest, sir."
00:43:55.520,00:43:57.840,So who do you think stole the guns?
00:43:57.920,00:44:04.960,"- The Fenians or the communists? - If it is the IRA Fenians, I will find them and find the guns."
00:44:05.040,00:44:08.320,"If it is communists, I will find them and find the guns."
00:44:08.400,00:44:12.080,"If it is common criminals, I will find them and find the guns."
00:44:12.920,00:44:16.080,To me there is no distinction between any of the above.
00:44:17.280,00:44:24.960,"Ah. We chose you because you are effective, but remember this, Mr. Campbell, this is England, not Belfast."
00:44:25.040,00:44:28.560,Bodies thrown in the rivers wash up in the papers here.
00:44:28.720,00:44:35.680,"We must keep the existence of these stolen guns out of the news, otherwise we're simply advertising them for sale."
00:44:36.320,00:44:43.400,"If there are bodies to be buried, dig holes, and dig them deep."
00:44:45.240,00:44:48.960,"I want everything accounted for, down to the last bullet."
00:45:06.080,00:45:09.240,They are aboard. There's no moon.
00:45:09.640,00:45:14.720,We can take them out to the turning point beyond Gas Street and leave them on the bank.
00:45:14.800,00:45:17.360,They'll be found by railway men first thing.
00:45:23.840,00:45:25.520,Is that agreement?
00:45:28.080,00:45:29.880,I changed my mind.
00:45:30.840,00:45:32.120,You what?
00:45:34.120,00:45:36.000,I have an alternative strategy.
00:45:38.040,00:45:41.080,Tell Curly to take her out to the old tobacco wharf.
00:45:41.160,00:45:44.240,There's a lock-up mooring we used to keep cigarettes.
00:45:44.320,00:45:45.480,He knows it.
00:45:46.160,00:45:50.000,"When the boat leaves your yard, it's no longer your concern."
00:45:52.040,00:45:54.040,Have you lost your fucking mind?
00:45:54.720,00:45:56.520,Have you not seen the streets?
00:45:56.600,00:45:59.440,They've sent a fucking army to find these things.
00:45:59.520,00:46:02.320,That's right. They've shown their hand.
00:46:02.400,00:46:03.440,Their hand?
00:46:03.520,00:46:06.640,"If they want them back this bad, they'll have to pay."
00:46:06.720,00:46:08.400,That's the way of the world.
00:46:08.480,00:46:13.800,"Fortune drops something valuable into your lap, you don't dump it on the bank of the Cut."
00:46:16.320,00:46:17.760,"You're blood, Tommy."
00:46:19.040,00:46:21.480,I've always looked out for you like a dad.
00:46:24.040,00:46:27.000,You're going to bring holy hell down on your head.
00:46:28.520,00:46:30.920,This copper takes no prisoners.
00:46:31.920,00:46:33.840,I'm told he didn't serve.
00:46:34.920,00:46:36.560,Reserved occupation.
00:46:39.800,00:46:42.360,"Is it another war you're looking for, Tommy?"
00:46:43.640,00:46:45.400,The tobacco wharf.
00:46:46.800,00:46:48.920,By order of the Peaky Blinders.
00:47:20.480,00:47:22.120,Are you in position?
00:47:25.040,00:47:26.400,"I am, sir."
00:47:28.040,00:47:30.080,Your first impressions.
00:47:30.600,00:47:33.160,I am quite shocked at how these people live.
00:47:36.080,00:47:38.800,Have you found anything out that might help me?
00:47:38.880,00:47:41.600,I interrogated the head of the Peaky Blinders.
00:47:41.680,00:47:43.320,He didn't know anything.
00:47:43.400,00:47:44.560,A brute.
00:47:44.960,00:47:48.640,It strikes me that it isn't Arthur who heads the Shelby family.
00:47:48.720,00:47:51.640,"It is the younger one, Thomas."
00:47:53.960,00:47:56.960,They say he won two medals for gallantry in the war.
00:47:57.560,00:47:59.200,You sound fascinated.
00:48:01.960,00:48:05.040,"However, my opinion has not changed."
00:48:05.520,00:48:10.920,The bookmaker gangs have other business and the communists are too weak to have planned this.
00:48:12.520,00:48:15.160,I believe the guns were taken by the IRA.
00:48:17.400,00:48:22.000,You must not let your personal history cloud your judgment.
00:48:26.480,00:48:28.000,What history?
00:48:30.000,00:48:34.200,That the IRA murdered my father will not affect my judgment.
00:48:38.360,00:48:43.480,"If you see any guns, check the serial numbers against that list."
00:48:47.400,00:48:52.080,Your father was the finest officer I ever worked with.
00:48:52.840,00:48:55.520,"I know he'd be very, very proud of you."
00:49:25.120,00:49:28.440,"Danny, as you know, the man you killed was Italian."
00:49:30.120,00:49:32.800,And those two men over there are his brothers.
00:49:35.880,00:49:41.640,"If I let the Italians do this, Danny, they'll cut off your manhood and let you drain."
00:49:42.440,00:49:44.960,That's how those bastards do things.
00:49:46.320,00:49:54.320,"So, to stop a war breaking out between us and the Italians, and to save you from their barbarity..."
00:49:57.280,00:49:59.520,I said I would dispatch you myself.
00:50:01.800,00:50:03.320,They are here to witness.
00:50:11.000,00:50:13.000,"I died over there anyway, Tommy."
00:50:14.720,00:50:16.840,I left my fucking brains in the mud.
00:50:20.640,00:50:22.720,"You have any last requests, comrade?"
00:50:28.440,00:50:31.680,You'll look out for my Rosie and my boys.
00:50:34.360,00:50:36.080,See they get apprenticeships.
00:50:36.400,00:50:39.320,At the BSA factory or the Austin.
00:50:42.240,00:50:44.840,And they'll make foremen. I know they will.
00:50:46.360,00:50:48.440,Just ordinary.
00:50:49.640,00:50:51.600,Just ordinary men.
00:50:51.920,00:50:58.200,"And they won't get told to do the shit, the shit, the shit that we got told to do."
00:51:10.920,00:51:12.920,I suppose I ought to pray now.
00:51:16.680,00:51:21.320,"Those fucking guns, they blew God right out of my head."
00:51:28.000,00:51:29.360,Is that boat for me?
00:51:33.680,00:51:36.560,"We have to get your body out of the city, Danny."
00:51:36.640,00:51:38.320,"This new copper, you know..."
00:51:38.400,00:51:41.200,Don't bury me anywhere there's mud. Okay?
00:51:42.280,00:51:43.480,Promise me.
00:51:46.160,00:51:47.360,Bury me on a hill.
00:51:48.120,00:51:49.560,And tell Rosie where.
00:51:53.560,00:51:57.520,You were a good man and a good soldier.
00:52:01.520,00:52:03.160,"Yes, Sergeant Major."
00:52:25.120,00:52:27.160,In the bleak midwinter.
00:53:21.880,00:53:23.440,It bloody won!
00:53:23.760,00:53:26.160,Monaghan Boy bloody won!
00:53:27.640,00:53:29.760,Yeah. It won.
00:53:31.520,00:53:33.040,And word will spread.
00:53:33.160,00:53:41.960,"So the next time we do the powder trick, it won't just be the Garrison that'll bet on the horse, it'll be the whole of Small Heath. And you know what?"
00:53:42.800,00:53:44.280,The horse will win again.
00:53:44.360,00:53:48.960,"And the third time we do it, we'll have the whole of Birmingham betting on it."
00:53:49.040,00:53:51.840,"1,000-quid bet on the magic horse."
00:53:51.920,00:53:57.600,"And that time, when we are ready, the horse will lose."
00:54:01.640,00:54:02.840,Think about it.
00:54:43.440,00:54:44.960,I'm still in shock.
00:54:46.960,00:54:49.040,Are you sure this isn't heaven?
00:54:49.120,00:54:51.720,"If it was heaven, what would I be doing here?"
00:54:54.800,00:54:59.320,"Tommy wanted you to think it was real, to try and knock some sense into you."
00:54:59.640,00:55:02.320,A shell full of sheep brains hurts pretty bad.
00:55:02.400,00:55:03.640,"Ah, it was meant to."
00:55:06.040,00:55:07.640,So where are you taking me?
00:55:07.720,00:55:10.560,London. Tommy has a little job for you.
00:55:10.920,00:55:12.840,Give you a chance to say thanks.
00:55:17.280,00:55:19.320,"You're a Peaky Blinder now, Danny."
00:55:36.160,00:55:37.840,There was no moon last night.
00:55:38.520,00:55:39.520,I checked.
00:55:39.600,00:55:43.080,- Did you do the right thing? - Yes. I did the right thing.
00:02:56.920,00:03:02.040,Go on. Go. They're from good people. Their granddad was a king.
00:03:02.160,00:03:04.760,Their granddad was a king.
00:00:55.480,00:00:58.160,I thought you said we were going to the fair.
00:00:59.400,00:01:02.960,We have business first. Come on. Bring your wits.
00:01:03.280,00:01:05.640,- What business? - That's the Lee family.
00:01:06.400,00:01:08.400,- Tommy! - Johnny Dogs.
00:01:08.480,00:01:10.160,"Tommy, how the hell are you?"
00:01:10.240,00:01:13.600,All the better for getting the city smoke out of my lungs.
00:01:13.680,00:01:16.240,I thought you became a bit too grand for us.
00:01:16.320,00:01:17.400,I've been busy.
00:01:17.480,00:01:20.760,- I'm riding with the Lee family now. - I heard.
00:01:21.080,00:01:23.200,"Myself, I'd rather live among pigs."
00:01:23.280,00:01:27.800,"Come on, Tommy. No disputing. So, your first fair since France?"
00:01:27.920,00:01:31.840,"What do you know about France, you war-shy Gypsy bastard?"
00:01:33.000,00:01:36.040,- So this is the horse? - And that's the car.
00:01:52.720,00:01:56.160,You're not swapping the family car for a bloody horse.
00:01:56.240,00:01:58.160,Of course we're not swapping it.
00:01:59.200,00:02:02.160,- That would be mad. - We're going to play two-up.
00:02:21.960,00:02:24.280,- Here you are. - I knew it.
00:02:24.360,00:02:26.800,"I knew it. Tommy, you bloody idiot."
00:02:26.880,00:02:28.680,"Shut up, Arthur, I won."
00:02:28.760,00:02:33.160,"- Good. - I promised Johnny, I'd let him have a spin in the car if he lost."
00:02:33.240,00:02:34.440,All right.
00:02:39.280,00:02:41.720,Are you Lee boys laughing at my brother?
00:02:44.000,00:02:45.040,Are you?
00:02:46.120,00:02:49.640,"- Eh? I asked you a question. - Tommy, come on!"
00:02:49.720,00:02:51.400,"Come on, it's just a crack."
00:02:51.480,00:02:56.840,Get your family out of here and go and enjoy yourselves at the fair before they start a war.
00:03:02.520,00:03:04.320,Their granddad was a King.
00:03:04.840,00:03:07.320,"Yeah, but his mother was a Diddicoy whore."
00:04:34.120,00:04:40.040,"We will take them before last night's beer, turns to piss and wakes the devils up."
00:04:40.680,00:04:42.920,We will leave no stone unturned.
00:04:43.000,00:04:47.200,"Every gun, every bullet will be brought to me for inspection."
00:04:47.280,00:04:50.240,"Now, take your positions."
00:05:27.560,00:05:28.560,Freddie.
00:05:33.600,00:05:36.080,You're sure your brothers are at the fair?
00:05:36.160,00:05:38.360,"If it was them, they wouldn't knock."
00:05:40.440,00:05:41.520,What is it?
00:05:41.600,00:05:44.080,The police are rounding up the communists.
00:05:44.800,00:05:48.040,"Come on, Ada, if the cops find me we are screwed. Fuck!"
00:06:11.360,00:06:14.720,"You have to jump, Ada. I'll catch you. Come on."
00:06:24.360,00:06:28.400,A prescription for iron tablets for Ada fucking Shelby.
00:06:31.400,00:06:33.320,"Mrs. Donovan, I need that favor."
00:06:33.400,00:06:36.440,- Come in and be quick. - I'm not coming in. She is.
00:06:36.520,00:06:38.520,"Holy Jesus, it's the Shelby girl."
00:06:38.600,00:06:40.600,"You've not seen her with me, okay?"
00:06:40.680,00:06:42.680,Just give her a cup of tea and let her stay until the police have gone.
00:06:42.760,00:06:45.680,She's the sister of those Peaky Blinder devils.
00:06:45.840,00:06:48.560,"And yet, she is an angel. Come on, Ada."
00:06:48.760,00:06:50.800,"What are you going to do, Freddie?"
00:06:50.880,00:06:53.400,Me? I'm gonna have to leave town for a bit.
00:07:10.760,00:07:16.360,"A gentleman would take off his hat, and put out his pipe."
00:07:24.640,00:07:29.600,"I see you Specials only dare come here, when you know the boys are away at the fair."
00:07:29.680,00:07:31.320,You mean your nephews?
00:07:31.720,00:07:36.200,With their guns and their razors? Is it them you're lighting candles for?
00:07:37.280,00:07:38.320,No.
00:07:38.400,00:07:43.600,I am lighting candles for the boys from the Garrison who lost their lives in France.
00:07:44.760,00:07:46.240,There's a list there.
00:07:48.200,00:07:49.280,Look.
00:07:54.520,00:07:58.680,"I hear you didn't make it to France, Inspector Campbell."
00:08:01.840,00:08:03.520,You've heard of me.
00:08:04.880,00:08:06.720,I've heard of you.
00:08:09.840,00:08:12.320,Is it the Holy Grail you're looking for?
00:08:12.440,00:08:17.160,"As a matter of fact, it is the Holy Grail I'm looking for."
00:08:17.280,00:08:20.240,Something precious. Something stolen.
00:08:20.680,00:08:23.000,Perhaps you know what I'm talking about.
00:08:25.960,00:08:30.320,"Sorry, I misunderstood your intention when you pushed me against the wall."
00:08:42.760,00:08:45.560,Turn the place upside down.
00:08:47.840,00:08:50.360,Arthur Shelby said you people would help us.
00:08:50.440,00:08:53.680,"If we don't know what you've lost, how can we help you find it?"
00:08:53.800,00:08:56.320,But I have found out subsequently that I was speaking to the wrong man.
00:08:56.400,00:08:59.200,Next time I want to talk to the boss.
00:09:00.760,00:09:07.200,"Lickey Tea Rooms. Friday, ten o'clock And when I say, The boss, I mean Thomas."
00:09:12.640,00:09:13.840,Come on.
00:09:39.800,00:09:42.560,"Now, what the bloody hell's been going on here?"
00:09:44.600,00:09:45.640,Jesus Christ.
00:09:47.840,00:09:50.320,Arthur'd agreed to it when he was arrested.
00:09:50.400,00:09:54.760,They said the Peaky Blinders had cleared out to the fair to let them do it.
00:09:54.840,00:09:58.840,I never said nothing to that copper about smashing up bloody houses.
00:09:58.920,00:10:03.120,"- All right. Which pubs did they do? - The Guns, the Chain, the Marquis."
00:10:03.200,00:10:05.680,All the ones that pay you to protect them.
00:10:05.760,00:10:08.360,Only one they didn't touch was the Garrison.
00:10:08.440,00:10:11.040,Make sure people think we were in on it.
00:10:11.440,00:10:13.320,"He's smart, this copper."
00:10:14.520,00:10:16.680,"So, go on. Drink your beers, get out."
00:10:16.760,00:10:20.320,You'd better show people you are still the cocks of the walk.
00:10:20.400,00:10:23.200,Hand out some cash to the landlords of the pubs.
00:10:23.280,00:10:25.520,Pay some veterans to fix the places up.
00:10:29.280,00:10:32.000,I have to go to Charlie's to stable the horse.
00:10:32.080,00:10:34.000,She looked footsore in the box.
00:10:37.400,00:10:39.160,Let them see your faces.
00:10:47.720,00:10:50.200,So we both know what they were looking for.
00:10:55.840,00:10:59.280,- You don't read the papers. - Racing papers.
00:10:59.560,00:11:01.560,So let me tell you the odds.
00:11:01.800,00:11:04.960,"I reckon it's three to one, there'll be a revolution."
00:11:05.040,00:11:08.680,- I wouldn't bet on that. - That copper's betting on it.
00:11:08.760,00:11:12.200,He's not going to let it rest till he gets those guns back.
00:11:19.640,00:11:21.360,"Did he talk to you, Pol?"
00:11:22.880,00:11:24.200,In the church.
00:11:25.480,00:11:27.400,Did he try to find our Ada?
00:11:28.440,00:11:29.880,She was sleeping.
00:11:33.280,00:11:35.240,"Where was she sleeping, Pol?"
00:11:36.760,00:11:39.480,I thought you didn't care for women's business.
00:11:45.360,00:11:48.920,He knows you're the boss. He wants to meet you.
00:11:55.280,00:11:57.800,- Will you talk to him? - No.
00:11:59.240,00:12:01.960,You don't parley when you're on the back foot.
00:12:22.000,00:12:24.400,"Finn, lad? What are you doing?"
00:12:24.480,00:12:26.120,We're having a fire.
00:12:27.960,00:12:30.720,- Two bob for your picture of the King. - What?
00:12:30.800,00:12:32.640,Bring it to Watery Lane.
00:12:32.760,00:12:34.760,"- Hello, Finn lad. - Hello, Scud."
00:12:39.000,00:12:40.240,Come on.
00:12:54.440,00:12:55.840,"Chuck them on, boys."
00:13:01.160,00:13:03.560,I hope to God you know what you're doing.
00:13:23.720,00:13:27.400,I'm a reporter with the Birmingham Evening Despatch.
00:13:27.480,00:13:29.280,I had a phone call.
00:13:29.640,00:13:32.120,Someone called Thomas Shelby?
00:13:32.200,00:13:33.560,Come with me.
00:13:38.120,00:13:39.400,Tommy.
00:13:39.840,00:13:41.800,"Move back for us, please, folks."
00:13:41.880,00:13:43.520,- You're Mr. Shelby? - I am.
00:13:43.600,00:13:45.120,"All the way back, please."
00:13:47.640,00:13:51.040,"- You said, I would be protected. - You're protected."
00:13:52.200,00:13:53.720,What's going on?
00:13:53.880,00:13:56.720,There are some things I want you to write down.
00:13:58.000,00:14:03.040,"Now, first of all, it's not that people around here are disloyal to the King."
00:14:03.120,00:14:04.240,It's the opposite.
00:14:04.320,00:14:10.240,"You see, we don't want our beloved King looking down and seeing the things that are being done to us."
00:14:10.320,00:14:12.320,So we are taking down his pictures.
00:14:12.400,00:14:14.160,But why are you burning them?
00:14:14.600,00:14:17.400,We went through hell for our King.
00:14:17.480,00:14:20.880,Walked through the flames of war. Write all this down.
00:14:20.960,00:14:24.200,And now we're being attacked in our own homes.
00:14:24.280,00:14:29.720,"These new coppers over from Belfast, breaking into our homes and interfering with our women."
00:14:29.800,00:14:33.160,We don't think our King would want to see that happening.
00:14:33.240,00:14:36.240,So we're lighting fires to raise the alarm.
00:14:36.320,00:14:39.680,"May I ask you, in what capacity do you speak?"
00:14:39.760,00:14:41.160,No capacity.
00:14:41.840,00:14:46.400,I am an ordinary man. I won gallantry medals at the Somme.
00:14:46.800,00:14:50.040,I want you to write in your paper what's going on here.
00:14:51.280,00:14:52.760,"Go on, go."
00:14:52.840,00:15:03.440,muttering muttering Come in.
00:15:06.840,00:15:11.360,"There, there. There's a telephone call for you, sir, on the London line."
00:15:11.680,00:15:14.280,There is? It's almost midnight.
00:15:14.360,00:15:17.120,"It's Mr. Winston Churchill, sir."
00:15:29.840,00:15:31.760,"- Yes, sir? - Inspector Campbell."
00:15:31.840,00:15:34.480,I hear there has been a bonfire in your city.
00:15:34.560,00:15:38.680,There was a small fire reported at around nine o' clock on Watery Lane.
00:15:38.760,00:15:41.320,"Certainly nothing to trouble you about, sir."
00:15:41.400,00:15:44.200,But I'm afraid it has troubled me.
00:15:44.280,00:15:51.480,"Half an hour ago, I received a wire communication from the editor of the Birmingham Evening Despatch."
00:15:51.680,00:15:59.080,"It seems one of his reporters was invited to the fire, and discovered that they were burning pictures of the King."
00:15:59.160,00:16:00.480,Of the King?
00:16:00.840,00:16:09.640,"Any newspaper report which may cause embarrassment to His Majesty, is always referred first and as a matter of routine to the Home Office."
00:16:09.720,00:16:13.120,I will go down there immediately and arrest those involved.
00:16:13.200,00:16:16.800,"No, you most certainly will not make arrests."
00:16:16.880,00:16:27.560,"If there are arrests there will be trials, if there are trials there will be more newspaper reports, which will necessarily mention the burning of the King's likeness."
00:16:27.640,00:16:32.240,I put you in Birmingham for one very specific reason.
00:16:32.320,00:16:35.960,Are you any nearer to finding those stolen guns?
00:16:36.040,00:16:39.040,- We are making steady progress. - We need results.
00:16:39.120,00:16:46.600,"- Good night, Mr. Campbell. - Sir. Could I at least ask, does this report name any of those involved?"
00:16:46.800,00:16:52.160,It names a Mr. Thomas Shelby. The report mentions he is a war hero.
00:17:02.880,00:17:04.920,Good of you to join us.
00:17:08.360,00:17:12.040,Couldn't sleep. Then I couldn't wake up.
00:17:12.120,00:17:15.320,Then I was cold and then I had to go for a wee.
00:17:15.600,00:17:20.240,"Then I was with this bear on a boat, but that was just a dream."
00:17:20.320,00:17:21.640,Then I was hungry.
00:17:22.880,00:17:24.720,Why are you reading the paper?
00:17:25.840,00:17:26.920,Why wouldn't I be?
00:17:27.000,00:17:29.040,I've never seen you read the paper.
00:17:29.120,00:17:31.760,I've only ever seen you light fires with them.
00:17:31.840,00:17:35.440,BSA are on strike. The miners are on strike.
00:17:35.520,00:17:39.000,"IRA are killing our boys, ten a day."
00:17:42.680,00:17:43.800,What?
00:17:44.600,00:17:46.080,Stand up.
00:17:46.160,00:17:48.560,- Why? - Just stand up.
00:17:54.920,00:17:56.120,Side on.
00:17:58.120,00:17:59.880,What are you doing?
00:18:00.240,00:18:04.600,"Ada, how late are you?"
00:18:07.440,00:18:08.600,One week.
00:18:11.120,00:18:12.800,Five weeks.
00:18:13.160,00:18:16.480,Seven if you count weekends. I think it's a lack of iron.
00:18:17.240,00:18:18.720,I got some tablets.
00:18:19.520,00:18:20.840,But they didn't work.
00:18:24.360,00:18:25.440,No.
00:18:38.120,00:18:39.880,"So, am I or not?"
00:18:45.120,00:18:48.800,"Keep bloody walking, Ada. If anybody sees us here they'll know."
00:18:48.880,00:18:51.040,"I'm not getting rid of it, Aunt Pol."
00:18:51.120,00:18:53.360,Just come home and we'll talk about it.
00:18:53.440,00:18:55.920,You get off me or I'll scream it. I swear.
00:18:58.760,00:19:02.120,"All right, you want to do this on the street, let's do it."
00:19:02.200,00:19:03.440,Whose is it?
00:19:03.520,00:19:07.160,"If I tell you, you'll tell them and they'll cut him to pieces."
00:19:07.520,00:19:09.520,"Not if he marries you, they won't."
00:19:12.160,00:19:13.680,Will he marry you?
00:19:14.080,00:19:17.000,"- I don't know where he is. - Jesus Christ, Ada!"
00:19:17.080,00:19:19.560,He's gone away but he said he'll come back.
00:19:19.640,00:19:23.040,- But they all say they'll come back. - He's not like that.
00:19:23.120,00:19:25.040,He's a good man. He promised.
00:19:36.240,00:19:38.480,"Get me down a Spanish saddle, Curly."
00:19:38.600,00:19:40.760,"Yes, Tommy, a Spanish saddle."
00:19:40.840,00:19:44.440,"He's a beauty. Yeah, yeah, beautiful. Yeah."
00:19:54.000,00:19:57.120,But is he worth falling out with the Lee family over?
00:20:08.960,00:20:11.040,I'm just passing it on.
00:20:12.000,00:20:15.240,A declaration of war. The whole Lee clan.
00:20:21.080,00:20:23.080,The guns and now this?
00:20:25.400,00:20:28.320,The guns are not spoken of.
00:20:29.240,00:20:30.320,Right?
00:20:33.240,00:20:34.480,Tommy...
00:20:34.960,00:20:36.040,Tommy!
00:20:38.680,00:20:42.680,"- You mind how you speak to me. - Forgive me, Uncle."
00:20:47.520,00:20:51.000,"It's Thomas Shelby against the whole bloody world, right?"
00:21:18.120,00:21:19.160,Easy...
00:21:21.680,00:21:23.080,"Easy, easy..."
00:21:25.960,00:21:27.320,"Easy, boy."
00:21:31.680,00:21:33.760,In France we used to say...
00:21:34.280,00:21:38.160,"In France we used to say, it's just the music hall band turning up."
00:21:38.240,00:21:40.720,"It's just trombones and tubas, that's all."
00:21:40.800,00:21:42.080,It's just noise.
00:21:49.080,00:21:52.400,You get used to it. It's just noise.
00:21:52.480,00:21:55.720,Good boy. Good boy. Good boy.
00:22:07.600,00:22:09.480,"Some pain there, boy?"
00:22:14.800,00:22:16.640,"I'm so sorry, Mr. Shelby."
00:22:19.360,00:22:22.080,"- I'm Grace, by the way. - I know who you are."
00:22:24.400,00:22:27.760,- What's his name? - He doesn't have a name.
00:22:28.440,00:22:30.320,Poor boy deserves a name.
00:22:31.360,00:22:33.240,You have something to say to me?
00:22:44.280,00:22:47.760,I'd like there to be one night a week when there is singing.
00:22:49.280,00:22:51.520,I think it would be good for everyone.
00:22:51.600,00:22:52.960,Saturday nights.
00:22:55.000,00:22:57.600,"Harry was too afraid to ask you, so..."
00:22:58.200,00:22:59.640,But you're not.
00:23:02.920,00:23:04.080,I am.
00:23:05.600,00:23:07.160,But I love to sing.
00:23:09.080,00:23:15.040,"You sound like one of those rich girls who come over from Dublin, for the races."
00:23:15.120,00:23:16.840,Do you like horses?
00:23:18.840,00:23:21.280,How do you fancy earning some extra money?
00:23:21.360,00:23:22.640,Doing what?
00:23:24.960,00:23:26.640,Dig out a nice dress.
00:23:27.520,00:23:29.480,I want to take you to the races.
00:24:12.200,00:24:13.720,"Sorry, Mr. Shelby."
00:24:23.360,00:24:25.360,"Hello, Mr. Shelby, how's it going?"
00:24:25.440,00:24:27.800,"- Hello, Frank, how's the leg? - Not bad."
00:24:27.880,00:24:30.040,"Good. Nice to see you, son."
00:24:31.320,00:24:32.840,"Morning, Charlie."
00:24:33.040,00:24:36.840,"- All right, Scudboat, how are we looking? - Looking good, Tommy."
00:24:36.920,00:24:40.600,"- Grand stuff. - Tommy, they are all here for Monaghan Boy."
00:24:40.680,00:24:42.960,"That's what I like to hear, Johnny boy."
00:24:43.040,00:24:44.880,And Aunt Pol wants to see you.
00:25:50.080,00:25:52.120,"Tell me the man's name, Ada."
00:25:53.200,00:25:55.160,Rudolf Valentino.
00:26:15.120,00:26:16.560,Get out!
00:26:16.880,00:26:19.880,All of you! Go on! Now!
00:26:23.680,00:26:25.880,"I said, tell me his fucking name."
00:26:29.640,00:26:32.440,Freddie fucking Thorne!
00:26:34.440,00:26:40.120,Yeah. Your best mate since school. The man who saved your life in France!
00:26:40.200,00:26:45.360,"So go on! Go on, cut him! Cut him up and chuck him in the Cut!"
00:26:48.240,00:26:53.280,"Oye, I'm a Shelby, too, you know. Put my fucking film back on!"
00:27:26.440,00:27:29.080,So Monaghan Boy finally lost.
00:27:30.960,00:27:32.720,Third time unlucky.
00:27:33.520,00:27:35.640,We took money from all over the city.
00:27:35.720,00:27:38.680,"Yeah, but you'll pay it back to people around here."
00:27:39.200,00:27:40.760,Buy your popularity back.
00:27:41.240,00:27:42.560,Already done.
00:27:42.960,00:27:44.400,Taught you well.
00:27:45.520,00:27:49.200,And you fixed this race without the permission of Billy Kimber?
00:27:50.720,00:27:53.040,"Obviously, didn't teach you well enough."
00:27:53.120,00:27:55.680,Rule one. You don't punch above your weight.
00:27:55.760,00:27:58.800,- Billy Kimber is there for the taking. - Says who?
00:27:58.880,00:28:01.080,Says Tommy and his parliament of one?
00:28:01.160,00:28:03.600,I ran this business for five years...
00:28:03.680,00:28:06.200,"Yeah, while I was away fighting, remember?"
00:28:06.280,00:28:10.240,"I learnt some things, such as, you strike when your enemy is weak."
00:28:11.680,00:28:14.520,I thought you came here to talk family business.
00:28:15.720,00:28:17.040,I'll deal with it.
00:28:17.120,00:28:20.160,- You're too busy taking over the world. - Polly.
00:28:21.040,00:28:23.360,"If it's about Ada, I need to know."
00:28:30.680,00:28:33.320,Ada wants you to give Freddie this letter.
00:28:33.960,00:28:36.760,She wants Freddie to know she's having his baby.
00:28:36.840,00:28:39.680,He deserves an opportunity to do the right thing.
00:28:39.960,00:28:41.800,I say we give them a chance.
00:28:47.640,00:28:52.520,"For a woman who's had a hard life with men, you're still full of romance, eh?"
00:28:53.160,00:28:55.720,What do you think Freddie sees in our Ada?
00:28:55.800,00:28:57.760,- That's Freddie's business. - No.
00:28:57.840,00:28:59.760,No. I'll tell you what he sees.
00:28:59.840,00:29:05.560,"He sees machine guns and rifles, and ammunition and some glorious revolution."
00:29:05.640,00:29:08.400,What is it you really don't like about Freddie?
00:29:08.480,00:29:10.880,She'll have no life with a man on the run.
00:29:10.960,00:29:13.400,"If you can't see that, you can't see much."
00:29:18.200,00:29:20.840,Damn them for what they did to you in France!
00:29:23.520,00:29:26.680,"Tell Ada, Freddie went to America."
00:29:27.240,00:29:28.600,Or Russia.
00:29:28.680,00:29:32.880,"Polly, it would do no good for Ada to bring a baby into the world alone."
00:29:32.960,00:29:34.240,"Pol, listen."
00:29:34.320,00:29:40.440,"The truth is you would have hit me with that thing, if it weren't for the fact that you know I'm right!"
00:29:44.960,00:29:46.960,I thought I heard someone knocking.
00:29:47.840,00:29:49.640,Couldn't get back to sleep.
00:30:04.760,00:30:08.120,"Believe me, I know."
00:30:10.720,00:30:12.480,I was 16.
00:30:14.760,00:30:16.800,And I didn't dare tell anyone.
00:30:17.640,00:30:19.560,"Polly, Freddie will come back."
00:30:20.200,00:30:22.240,In the end I did it myself.
00:30:24.280,00:30:26.160,I did it to myself.
00:30:26.800,00:30:28.480,And I almost died.
00:30:29.520,00:30:31.320,And he didn't come back.
00:30:31.840,00:30:34.200,They don't. Why should they?
00:30:34.880,00:30:36.480,You know the words.
00:30:36.560,00:30:39.600,"You're a whore, the baby's a bastard."
00:30:39.680,00:30:42.920,But there's no word for the man who doesn't come back.
00:30:46.240,00:30:59.160,"One day, on your wedding day, you'll have a good man on your arm, and you will say, Polly, thank you for common sense."
00:31:08.040,00:31:09.920,This woman is in Cardiff.
00:31:11.240,00:31:13.160,We'll take the train tomorrow.
00:31:16.600,00:31:19.160,Go to the castle afterwards for a treat.
00:32:12.800,00:32:17.880,I chose this place because it is outside both of our jurisdictions.
00:32:19.800,00:32:21.440,Do you want tea?
00:32:23.040,00:32:28.040,"Inspector, I responded to your invitation, because I want us to understand each other."
00:32:29.000,00:32:30.840,I am a businessman.
00:32:31.520,00:32:33.960,I want to make my business successful.
00:32:34.760,00:32:37.440,And I want my city run peacefully.
00:32:38.240,00:32:41.520,"If the city is peaceful, business can thrive."
00:32:42.880,00:32:45.280,So we are on the same side?
00:32:46.440,00:32:48.320,I think perhaps we could be.
00:32:55.040,00:32:56.240,Now...
00:33:00.160,00:33:04.080,How can we be on the same side when I see things like this?
00:33:06.240,00:33:12.760,My men found this in the bedroom of a known communist.
00:33:13.560,00:33:15.960,It has your sister's name on it.
00:33:17.680,00:33:20.760,It was obvious she had been sleeping in his bed.
00:33:21.760,00:33:26.680,"Are you also in bed with the communists, Mr. Shelby?"
00:33:27.080,00:33:29.160,I do not share their fantasy.
00:33:29.960,00:33:34.400,"And as for my sister, I have already dealt with the situation."
00:33:34.880,00:33:37.480,Freddie Thorne is at the very top of my list.
00:33:37.560,00:33:39.000,Cross him off.
00:33:39.560,00:33:41.840,He won't be returning to the city.
00:33:43.200,00:33:45.400,I will make him part of our deal.
00:33:47.000,00:33:48.480,What deal?
00:33:52.800,00:33:56.760,You and your Specials will leave my businesses alone from now on.
00:33:56.960,00:34:02.320,"No more raids into our territory, no more smashing up pubs, no more lifting my runners."
00:34:02.400,00:34:05.520,You turn a blind eye to all of my gambling operations.
00:34:05.600,00:34:06.800,Also...
00:34:07.440,00:34:11.160,I am planning an expansion onto the race tracks.
00:34:11.280,00:34:14.360,I intend to do business with Billy Kimber.
00:34:14.520,00:34:18.280,He runs most of the legal track side betting outside of London.
00:34:18.440,00:34:20.640,He has policemen on his payroll.
00:34:20.720,00:34:28.800,"I want you to put in a word with the Chief Inspector at Gloucestershire, that his men should leave me alone when I make my move."
00:34:31.840,00:34:37.400,Forgive me. I don't seem to have a pen to write down this rather long list of demands.
00:34:40.920,00:34:42.960,And what do I get in return?
00:34:44.560,00:34:46.480,I have what you're looking for.
00:34:52.040,00:34:53.480,I have the guns.
00:34:56.000,00:34:57.360,What guns?
00:34:57.440,00:35:00.040,"- I'm not here to play games-- - Wait, wait."
00:35:11.440,00:35:16.680,"Twenty-five Lewis machine guns. 50 carbines, 10,000 rounds of ammunition."
00:35:16.760,00:35:22.200,"All in a crate bound for Libya, stolen from the BSA factory proofing bay."
00:35:23.080,00:35:26.800,I'm guessing they sent you to Birmingham to get those guns back.
00:35:26.880,00:35:29.680,"Well, it's me that has them."
00:35:31.800,00:35:39.880,"I have left word with men I trust that if I am taken into police custody for whatever reason, those guns will be shipped to Liverpool."
00:35:39.960,00:35:45.840,"From there they will be sent directly to Belfast, and sold to the Irish Republican Army."
00:35:46.560,00:35:49.280,All your good work in Ireland would be undone.
00:35:49.360,00:35:51.920,Each stolen weapon is numbered and marked.
00:35:52.000,00:35:56.400,"If I sell them to the IRA, it won't be long before Mr. Churchill finds out."
00:35:56.560,00:36:01.320,I imagine you got into enough trouble over the burning of the King's photographs.
00:36:01.400,00:36:03.080,That was just a taster.
00:36:03.320,00:36:09.240,"If those guns reach Belfast, your life in the force is over."
00:36:10.080,00:36:15.760,"When I have achieved what I have set out to achieve, I will let you know where to find the guns."
00:36:15.840,00:36:19.520,"You'll be a hero, you will probably get a medal."
00:36:22.000,00:36:23.440,I'm a fair man.
00:36:24.320,00:36:25.880,It's a fair offer.
00:36:28.000,00:36:29.520,Do we have a deal?
00:36:38.160,00:36:39.560,I need an answer.
00:36:40.160,00:36:41.440,Right now.
00:36:46.240,00:36:47.480,Very well.
00:36:49.800,00:36:53.440,But I would prefer if we don't shake hands on it.
00:37:06.640,00:37:11.600,"Now why would I shake the hand of a man, who didn't even fight for his country?"
00:37:55.560,00:37:56.760,Grace.
00:38:02.880,00:38:05.800,I have new information.
00:38:08.480,00:38:14.320,"Thomas Shelby is now the beginning, the middle and end of your mission."
00:38:26.200,00:38:27.800,So what shall I do?
00:38:29.360,00:38:51.440,"It hurts me as much as it, as it would a father sending his own daughter into a whore house, but no matter how repugnant it may be, you must do everything you can to get close to him, and find out where those guns are hidden."
00:38:54.440,00:38:57.840,"Of course, when I say, Everything, I don't mean..."
00:38:59.200,00:39:02.000,You underestimate me in every way.
00:39:11.600,00:39:12.840,Here...
00:39:23.400,00:39:28.440,You are now active in a military operation on behalf of the Crown.
00:39:30.160,00:39:34.200,"And I wish to God, circumstance hadn't chosen you."
00:39:35.880,00:39:37.640,It's what I am trained for.
00:39:38.800,00:39:40.400,I'm late for my shift.
00:39:44.840,00:39:45.880,Grace...
00:39:47.840,00:39:49.800,My heart is with you.
00:40:48.720,00:40:51.000,Tom! Tom!
00:40:51.360,00:40:54.920,"Tom, you better come quick, Tom! Come! Come!"
00:41:22.640,00:41:25.800,"- Curly, tell me. - It's a curse, Tom."
00:41:27.600,00:41:31.400,Curly. Curly. Curly. Shh. Curly. Curly.
00:41:32.520,00:41:35.920,"Tell me. Tell me, Curly, what's wrong with the horse?"
00:41:36.000,00:41:38.520,You bought it at the fair in bad feeling.
00:41:38.600,00:41:42.640,The Lees put a bad seed in the hoof. Got an old woman to put a spell!
00:41:47.560,00:41:49.920,So those Lee bastards cursed her.
00:41:51.160,00:41:54.560,"Whatever it is, he says it spread to the other foot."
00:41:54.640,00:41:57.600,"It's going to his heart by tomorrow, I'd say."
00:41:57.680,00:42:01.120,"Seen curses like this twice. Can't take them back, Tom!"
00:42:01.200,00:42:02.720,No! No!
00:42:03.000,00:42:05.000,"I told you, Tommy."
00:42:05.440,00:42:08.560,Better enemies to have than black blood Gypsies.
00:42:12.080,00:42:13.360,Get out.
00:42:14.600,00:42:16.080,"Get out, Curly."
00:42:22.240,00:42:23.560,I'm sorry.
00:43:02.600,00:43:06.520,"- We're closed, Mr. Shelby. - Just get me a drink."
00:43:20.040,00:43:21.680,Shall I leave you alone?
00:43:23.280,00:43:25.160,I came here for company.
00:43:26.160,00:43:29.400,- Where's Harry? - He took the night off.
00:43:32.040,00:43:33.600,And went to the pictures.
00:43:40.960,00:43:42.640,How's your beautiful horse?
00:43:52.480,00:43:54.520,I just put a bullet in his head.
00:43:58.680,00:44:00.040,Was he lame?
00:44:03.120,00:44:05.560,He looked at me the wrong way.
00:44:06.600,00:44:10.000,It's not a good idea to look at Tommy Shelby the wrong way.
00:44:15.240,00:44:19.480,- What a waste. - Yeah. A waste is what it is.
00:44:26.080,00:44:27.600,"You know, in France..."
00:44:32.160,00:44:35.240,"In France, I got used to seeing men die."
00:44:36.720,00:44:39.240,Never got used to seeing horses die.
00:44:41.080,00:44:42.840,They die badly.
00:44:49.600,00:44:51.680,I dug out a dress like you asked.
00:44:52.920,00:44:54.040,Thanks.
00:44:56.480,00:44:58.680,Is it Cheltenham you're talking about?
00:45:05.960,00:45:08.280,"Cheltenham's a grand affair, is it not?"
00:45:08.360,00:45:10.040,The King will be there.
00:45:10.120,00:45:12.520,- King George? - No.
00:45:13.600,00:45:17.160,King Billy Kimber and all his men.
00:45:19.480,00:45:21.160,And what must I do?
00:45:21.240,00:45:24.080,For two pounds you will do what I ask you to do.
00:45:25.680,00:45:27.120,I want three.
00:45:28.760,00:45:32.280,"If I'm meeting a king, I won't be wearing a cheap dress."
00:45:35.440,00:45:39.560,And I asked you to let me sing. That's part of the deal now too.
00:45:40.600,00:45:42.040,Since when?
00:45:44.080,00:45:45.720,Since you nearly smiled.
00:45:50.360,00:45:52.840,Saturday nights. Open and easy.
00:45:56.600,00:46:00.240,"You never worked in Dublin, so don't lie to me."
00:46:00.320,00:46:04.160,I asked around about that pub you said you used to work in.
00:46:04.240,00:46:05.960,I have friends over there.
00:46:06.840,00:46:08.640,No one has heard of you.
00:46:15.040,00:46:21.840,"My guess is, you are a girl from a good family, who got herself pregnant."
00:46:24.960,00:46:26.960,It's not something I want known.
00:46:27.040,00:46:30.480,And bringing a child into the world alone ruined your life.
00:46:31.480,00:46:32.760,Right?
00:46:36.680,00:46:40.600,So I'm right and Polly is wrong.
00:46:41.520,00:46:43.000,Right about what?
00:46:43.880,00:46:45.360,It doesn't matter.
00:46:46.800,00:46:48.840,It looks like it matters to you.
00:46:49.400,00:46:51.240,Family business.
00:46:54.920,00:46:56.880,You won't tell anyone my secret.
00:46:58.040,00:47:00.400,Do you think I tell people things?
00:47:04.320,00:47:05.920,So what do you sing?
00:47:07.760,00:47:10.120,- Anything you want. - Right.
00:47:11.000,00:47:12.480,Get up on a chair.
00:47:13.360,00:47:14.400,Okay.
00:47:21.920,00:47:23.280,Happy or sad?
00:47:27.000,00:47:28.080,Sad.
00:47:29.720,00:47:30.960,Okay.
00:47:31.040,00:47:34.320,"But I warn you, it will break your heart."
00:47:35.560,00:47:37.080,Already broken.
00:49:15.240,00:49:17.040,"- You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine."
00:49:17.840,00:49:21.920,I think there are some carriages over there that are gonna be empty...
00:49:24.920,00:49:26.200,Freddie.
00:49:27.120,00:49:28.520,You came back?
00:49:31.240,00:49:32.720,I got a tip-off.
00:49:32.800,00:49:34.520,"Freddie, Tommy will kill you."
00:49:34.600,00:49:36.560,It was Tommy who tipped me off.
00:49:36.640,00:49:39.080,Maybe he's got half a heart after all.
00:49:39.760,00:49:41.760,Tommy got a message to me.
00:49:42.120,00:49:45.360,"It said, Get out of town, take her with you."
00:49:46.920,00:49:48.000,So...
00:49:51.640,00:49:53.280,Ada Shelby...
00:49:56.120,00:49:57.840,Will you marry me?
00:49:59.000,00:50:00.280,Yes!
00:50:00.760,00:50:01.960,Yes.
00:50:03.840,00:50:05.040,Yes!
00:50:20.160,00:50:23.680,"Right, get on that bloody train and get out of here."
00:50:23.760,00:50:26.320,"- Come on, both of you. - Freddie, come on."
00:50:26.400,00:50:30.280,"Freddie, Cardiff's okay. Anywhere but here's okay."
00:50:30.440,00:50:32.480,"We're not going anywhere, Ada."
00:50:34.440,00:50:37.600,"We are going to stay here, we are going to marry here."
00:50:38.640,00:50:40.880,I'm not afraid of Tommy Shelby.
00:51:05.760,00:51:07.680,Go and play snap with Finn.
00:51:11.240,00:51:14.440,"Why no whiskey, Tommy? Are you expecting trouble?"
00:51:16.880,00:51:20.280,"Jesus Christ, Tommy, what the hell made you let them sing?"
00:51:20.360,00:51:22.920,It's like they're strangling cats out there.
00:51:30.680,00:51:31.920,"Yeah, it is."
00:51:32.000,00:51:34.960,"- It's about time, Tommy. - Time for what?"
00:51:36.040,00:51:39.920,- Time you took yourself a woman. - Just play the bloody hands.
00:51:40.080,00:51:44.160,"You stay the way you are, Tommy. Remember what Dad used to say."
00:51:44.240,00:51:45.960,Fast women and slow horses...
00:52:13.720,00:52:17.800,Holy shit. It's Billy Kimber.
00:52:26.560,00:52:29.560,Is there any man here named Shelby?
00:52:36.680,00:52:40.760,"I said, is there any man here named Shelby?"
00:52:47.000,00:52:50.640,"Harry, get these men a drink. Everyone else, go home!"
00:53:03.880,00:53:05.400,You go home.
00:53:05.480,00:53:08.080,"- But Mr. Fenton said-- - I said, go home."
00:53:10.560,00:53:14.600,"I've never approved of women in pubs, but when they look like that..."
00:53:14.680,00:53:17.120,You said you wanted men called Shelby.
00:53:17.200,00:53:19.080,You've got three of them.
00:53:19.480,00:53:22.480,I'd never heard of you. Then I did hear of you.
00:53:22.560,00:53:26.480,"Some little Diddicoy razor gang. I thought to myself, So, what?"
00:53:27.040,00:53:32.160,But then you fuck me over. So now you have my undivided attention.
00:53:33.720,00:53:36.840,"By the way, which one am I talking to? Who's the boss?"
00:53:37.680,00:53:39.000,"Well, I'm the oldest."
00:53:41.640,00:53:43.600,Are you laughing at my brother?
00:53:45.880,00:53:48.400,"Right, he's the oldest, you're the thickest."
00:53:48.480,00:53:55.800,"I'm told the boss is called Tommy and I'm guessing that's you, 'cause you're looking me up and down like I'm a fucking tart."
00:53:56.000,00:53:58.040,I want to know what you want.
00:53:58.120,00:54:01.320,There were suspicious betting patterns at Kempton Park.
00:54:01.400,00:54:03.520,A horse called Monaghan Boy.
00:54:04.080,00:54:09.560,"He won by a length twice and then finished last, with 3,000 pounds bet on him."
00:54:09.640,00:54:11.360,Which one am I talking to?
00:54:11.880,00:54:13.600,Which one of you is the boss?
00:54:13.680,00:54:16.040,I am Mr. Kimber's adviser and accountant.
00:54:16.120,00:54:19.200,"And I'm the fucking boss. Okay, right, end of parley."
00:54:19.280,00:54:21.800,You fixed a race without my permission.
00:54:21.920,00:54:24.840,You fucking Gypsy scum.
00:54:24.920,00:54:28.920,"What, live off the war pensions of these poor Garrison Lane widows!"
00:54:29.000,00:54:30.240,That's your level!
00:54:30.320,00:54:33.880,"I am Billy Kimber, I run the races!"
00:54:33.960,00:54:37.880,You fixed one of them so I'm going to have you shot against a post.
00:54:39.200,00:54:40.360,Mr. Kimber.
00:54:47.680,00:54:49.600,That is my name on it.
00:54:50.240,00:54:52.360,It's from the Lee family.
00:54:53.120,00:54:56.480,"You are also at war with the Lees, Mr. Kimber, am I right?"
00:54:59.600,00:55:03.000,The Lees are attacking your bookies and taking your money.
00:55:03.080,00:55:06.760,Your men can't control them. You need help.
00:55:07.960,00:55:11.400,Perhaps we should listen to what Mr. Shelby has to say.
00:55:11.640,00:55:13.760,Before we make our decisions.
00:55:14.240,00:55:18.320,Right. The Lees are doing a lot of talking at the fairs.
00:55:18.400,00:55:19.760,They have a lot of kin.
00:55:19.840,00:55:25.000,"They're saying the race tracks are easy meat, because the police are busy with strikes."
00:55:25.080,00:55:28.120,"Now, we have connections. We know how they operate."
00:55:28.200,00:55:30.840,You have muscle.
00:55:30.920,00:55:34.200,"Together, we can beat them. Divided, maybe not."
00:55:36.160,00:55:43.960,"Mr. Kimber, perhaps we should take some time for reflection, possibly make arrangements for a second meeting."
00:55:44.040,00:55:46.320,"I admire you, Mr. Kimber."
00:55:46.760,00:55:51.040,"You started with nothing, and built a legitimate business."
00:55:51.640,00:55:56.040,"It would be an honor to work with you, Mr. Kimber."
00:55:57.920,00:56:02.320,Nobody works with me. People work for me.
00:56:07.040,00:56:08.760,"Pick it up, pikey."
00:56:19.480,00:56:21.320,"Sit, sit down."
00:56:29.320,00:56:33.360,"- It's for your ceiling. - Thank you, Mr. Kimber."
00:56:37.000,00:56:40.960,- We will be at Cheltenham. - As will I.
00:57:01.720,00:57:04.480,So you picked a fight with the Lees on purpose.
00:57:04.560,00:57:08.600,"Tommy, we can't mess with Billy fucking Kimber."
00:57:08.680,00:57:12.760,"Get yourself a decent haircut, man. We're going to the races."
00:00:54.360,00:00:57.480,"Give me a bottle of whiskey and three glasses, please."
00:00:57.560,00:00:59.120,- Scotch or Irish? - Irish.
00:01:02.160,00:01:04.959,"I've decided not to go, to the races."
00:01:05.040,00:01:09.320,"Not unless you give me another two pound ten shilling, toward the dress."
00:01:09.600,00:01:11.320,I've already given you three.
00:01:11.400,00:01:14.440,How much did you pay for the suit you'll be wearing?
00:01:14.520,00:01:15.840,I don't pay for suits.
00:01:15.920,00:01:18.840,My suits are on the house or the house burns down.
00:01:20.200,00:01:23.000,So you want me to go looking like a flower girl?
00:01:23.160,00:01:25.280,What I want makes no difference.
00:01:29.040,00:01:31.160,It's not me you're dressing up for.
00:02:01.280,00:02:04.360,"You'll forgive me, Mr. Shelby, if I indulge a little."
00:02:04.880,00:02:06.200,Please.
00:02:07.080,00:02:11.000,It takes a lot for a man from Sparkbrook to step inside this pub.
00:02:11.520,00:02:15.360,Anyone with money and good intentions is welcome in the Garrison.
00:02:18.520,00:02:21.600,"Now, you said you had business."
00:02:25.680,00:02:27.320,"It's delicate, Mr. Shelby."
00:02:28.480,00:02:31.280,It's a question of who knows what about what.
00:02:32.800,00:02:35.480,Concerns the factory down the road at the BSA.
00:02:37.520,00:02:41.120,"Now, as you might know, most of the paint shop there is Irish."
00:02:42.040,00:02:45.320,"Big, old place like that, rumors get started."
00:02:45.440,00:02:47.360,Rumors that there was a robbery.
00:02:50.240,00:02:51.880,Robbery of what?
00:03:00.480,00:03:04.400,"When it comes to speculation, you can't beat a factory night shift."
00:03:05.000,00:03:07.760,Some say there was word from the proofing bay...
00:03:08.360,00:03:11.000,That it was the Peaky Blinders who took them.
00:03:12.120,00:03:14.120,Your night shift must be dreaming.
00:03:14.200,00:03:16.360,- Maybe they are. - Maybe they're not.
00:03:16.440,00:03:25.840,"What we are trying to say is, Mr. Shelby, that if you were to hear about the whereabouts of said items, we would pay good money."
00:03:25.920,00:03:29.360,- You have good money? - We have collections from the pubs.
00:03:34.080,00:03:36.240,The Irish Republican Army.
00:03:36.520,00:03:38.880,- For a fact? - For a fucking fact.
00:03:44.320,00:03:48.320,- You think we're jokers? - Am I laughing?
00:04:02.800,00:04:04.360,"Maguire, will you shut up?"
00:04:40.520,00:04:41.960,Bravo.
00:04:45.440,00:04:50.600,"All right, boys, when I know who knows what about what, I'll let you know."
00:04:58.440,00:05:01.200,I thought you only allowed singing on Saturday.
00:05:01.520,00:05:03.440,Whiskey is good proofing water.
00:05:03.520,00:05:05.720,It tells you who's real and who isn't.
00:05:05.800,00:05:07.640,And what did my countrymen want?
00:05:07.720,00:05:09.120,"Oh, they're nobodies."
00:05:09.560,00:05:12.040,They drink in the Black Swan in Sparkbrook.
00:05:12.120,00:05:15.000,They're only rebels because they like the songs.
00:05:15.080,00:05:16.880,You have sympathies with them?
00:05:16.960,00:05:19.280,I have no sympathies of any description.
00:05:19.360,00:05:23.280,"Their accents are so thick, it's a wonder you could understand them."
00:05:23.360,00:05:26.960,- Next time I could translate. - You'd work for me?
00:05:27.040,00:05:28.960,I thought I already was.
00:05:29.040,00:05:31.200,So you are coming to the races?
00:05:33.080,00:05:35.040,Two pound ten shillings.
00:05:39.040,00:05:40.320,Ten shillings.
00:05:41.520,00:05:44.960,Buy something red. To match his handkerchief.
00:05:45.120,00:05:46.560,Whose handkerchief?
00:06:10.560,00:06:12.080,"Ada, what the hell?"
00:06:12.160,00:06:15.520,I dared myself to run through their territory in my dress.
00:06:15.600,00:06:18.640,- Are you mad? - Yeah. Mad as hell with all of them.
00:06:18.720,00:06:19.760,I love you.
00:06:21.760,00:06:23.040,"I love you, too."
00:06:23.120,00:06:26.000,"The more they try and stop us, the madder I'll be."
00:06:26.080,00:06:29.200,"- Come on, princess, the vicar's waiting-- - Wait..."
00:06:29.760,00:06:30.960,How do I look?
00:06:36.080,00:06:37.440,Like an angel.
00:06:53.160,00:06:54.240,Moss?
00:06:55.520,00:06:58.400,What do we know about the Black Swan?
00:06:58.520,00:07:04.640,"An operative has provided intelligence, that it is a place where IRA men gather."
00:07:04.720,00:07:09.000,"It's just a lot of drunken navigators singing songs, sir."
00:07:09.080,00:07:11.320,The IRA wouldn't go near them.
00:07:11.400,00:07:14.120,Then why are two of them looking to buy guns?
00:07:16.560,00:07:17.920,Do you have names?
00:07:19.720,00:07:22.040,Must she do everything for you?
00:07:22.160,00:07:23.280,"She, sir?"
00:07:23.360,00:07:26.680,One female operative has proved more useful...
00:07:28.000,00:07:31.520,Than any of you great lumps of men.
00:07:31.600,00:07:36.080,"We are regular police officers, sir. Not spies."
00:07:36.160,00:07:38.960,We can only act when a crime has been committed.
00:07:39.040,00:07:43.160,Perhaps I should send some men down to the Black Swan to ask questions.
00:07:43.240,00:07:45.560,And scare them all into hiding?
00:07:45.640,00:07:47.880,"Not the best of tactics, Sergeant."
00:07:47.960,00:07:51.800,My tactics come from my experiences in France.
00:07:51.880,00:07:56.080,"Most of my great lumps of men served in France, too, sir."
00:07:58.360,00:08:01.920,I serve my country every day.
00:08:03.440,00:08:05.040,"That will be all, sergeant."
00:09:34.560,00:09:35.880,"Fancy me, do ya?"
00:09:37.640,00:09:39.840,What are you? Copper?
00:09:42.920,00:09:44.240,Proddy bitch.
00:09:45.320,00:09:46.760,I've seen you!
00:09:47.080,00:09:49.680,"I've seen your face, serving at the Garrison."
00:09:49.760,00:09:51.200,Come here.
00:09:51.280,00:09:55.400,I am taking you in for interrogation on behalf of the Irish Free State.
00:10:22.320,00:10:23.760,All right?
00:10:25.440,00:10:27.000,Are you armed?
00:10:29.000,00:10:30.200,No.
00:10:31.960,00:10:33.520,Then I'll tell you.
00:10:35.480,00:10:37.920,Ada and Freddie Thorne were married today.
00:10:38.040,00:10:41.200,"They defied your orders, they haven't left the city."
00:10:53.640,00:10:55.080,I'll deal with it.
00:10:58.320,00:11:01.680,Thomas. I'll deal with it.
00:11:02.360,00:11:03.600,Where are they?
00:11:03.680,00:11:07.240,Freddie's comrades have safe houses. Why do you want to know?
00:11:07.320,00:11:10.000,I want to send them flowers. Why do you think?
00:11:10.080,00:11:12.240,Would it be so bad if they stayed?
00:11:13.640,00:11:15.880,I promised I'd run Freddie out of town.
00:11:18.080,00:11:19.240,Promised who?
00:11:30.520,00:11:33.200,I told the coppers Freddie wouldn't come back.
00:11:33.320,00:11:34.800,It was part of the deal.
00:11:34.880,00:11:36.840,What bloody deal?
00:11:36.960,00:11:40.280,What happened to family votes? What happened to meetings?
00:11:42.800,00:11:46.280,"If you let me deal with Ada and Freddie, it'll end in peace."
00:11:50.120,00:11:52.760,Christ knows you have had your fill of war.
00:11:57.880,00:12:02.680,"You get Freddie out of town, Pol. Or else I'll deal with him myself."
00:13:03.280,00:13:05.400,The pub that you had told me about.
00:13:05.480,00:13:10.800,And a neighbor said that she saw a young woman leaving the street where the body was found.
00:13:11.840,00:13:15.640,"A woman, sir. I was wondering if there was a connection."
00:13:16.160,00:13:19.120,"A connection with what, Sergeant?"
00:13:19.200,00:13:22.320,"You said that your spy was a woman, sir."
00:13:22.760,00:13:25.400,I wondered if there was now a policy.
00:13:28.760,00:13:32.920,Shoot to kill. Like there was in Belfast.
00:13:34.880,00:13:37.200,The Republicans are famously factional.
00:13:38.360,00:13:40.400,He was killed by one of his own.
00:13:42.960,00:13:44.600,"That will be all, Sergeant."
00:13:46.760,00:13:50.960,And they are not called spies. They are called operatives.
00:13:51.040,00:13:52.880,"Operatives sir, right, sir."
00:14:02.600,00:14:04.920,What the bloody hell is she doing here?
00:14:05.840,00:14:07.560,"Two hundred pounds, Freddie."
00:14:09.840,00:14:13.280,- For what? - For us.
00:14:13.520,00:14:15.880,For a honeymoon that goes on forever.
00:14:20.280,00:14:23.280,- Where did it come from? - Family fund.
00:14:23.360,00:14:25.920,Pockets of widows and desperate men.
00:14:26.000,00:14:27.160,"See sense, Freddie."
00:14:29.840,00:14:33.640,"Times like these, a communist in the family is bad for business."
00:14:33.720,00:14:35.720,You have to leave the city.
00:14:35.800,00:14:38.000,You think I can't handle Tommy Shelby?
00:14:38.080,00:14:39.160,You can't.
00:14:39.240,00:14:42.800,I am having trouble these days and I'm twice the man you are.
00:14:45.960,00:14:47.680,I went into town.
00:14:48.480,00:14:50.760,The Cunard office.
00:14:50.920,00:14:55.200,"I booked you both tickets for the next boat, from Liverpool to New York."
00:14:57.360,00:15:01.040,"They've already had their revolution, you won't have to bother."
00:15:07.880,00:15:10.720,Would you ladies at least let a man sleep on it?
00:15:43.440,00:15:45.040,You had no business.
00:15:48.840,00:15:51.440,Observe and report. That is your remit.
00:15:51.520,00:15:54.000,I decided we needed to know where he lived.
00:15:54.080,00:16:00.720,I warned you not to let your personal history cloud your judgment. You went after him because he was IRA.
00:16:00.880,00:16:04.320,I followed him because I thought he might have information.
00:16:04.400,00:16:08.800,"According to the rules, I should pull you out of Garrison Lane immediately."
00:16:08.880,00:16:11.680,No. Cheltenham is tomorrow.
00:16:12.920,00:16:15.240,You take too much upon yourself.
00:16:16.840,00:16:19.240,This is an active military mission.
00:16:19.320,00:16:22.280,Your words. I am doing my job.
00:16:22.800,00:16:27.680,"Grace, the death of a base Fenian does not concern me."
00:16:27.960,00:16:29.840,Your welfare does.
00:16:31.120,00:16:33.400,Killing a man affects the heart.
00:16:35.360,00:16:37.440,And as for my heart...
00:16:37.520,00:16:42.320,"I know that because of our family connections, you take my progress personally."
00:16:43.600,00:16:46.080,But I don't need you to be my father.
00:16:49.000,00:16:51.000,I will be thinking of you.
00:17:16.440,00:17:19.160,"- Mr. Shelby, sir. - Mr. Zhang."
00:17:20.839,00:17:24.640,"That suit is sold, sir. It is being collected this morning."
00:17:25.000,00:17:26.119,I know.
00:17:31.120,00:17:33.480,"Please, gentlemen. No fighting in here."
00:17:33.560,00:17:35.880,It's all right. I come as a friend.
00:17:36.880,00:17:40.320,"You're collecting your suit for Cheltenham, it's very nice."
00:17:40.400,00:17:42.280,How the bloody hell do you know?
00:17:42.360,00:17:44.520,"I know a lot of things, Mr. Kimber."
00:17:44.600,00:17:47.520,"And as I told you before, I know the Lee brothers."
00:17:47.600,00:17:51.280,And I know they're going to be at the Cheltenham races as well.
00:17:51.360,00:17:55.440,Yes. They're going to lose a lot of money on fast women and slow nags.
00:17:55.520,00:18:01.280,No. They're planning on showing up in numbers and robbing your bookies. Running chalk and rafflers.
00:18:01.360,00:18:03.440,You think I can't handle the Lees?
00:18:03.520,00:18:06.520,Just a word of warning from a friend. That's all.
00:18:08.680,00:18:10.640,I'll see you at Cheltenham.
00:18:10.720,00:18:13.640,I'll wave at you from my box.
00:18:17.640,00:18:19.040,Already invited.
00:18:26.360,00:18:31.120,"As you know, to even gather like this is today is illegal."
00:18:31.200,00:18:37.560,Chief Inspector Campbell has ordered that we are not allowed to assemble in groups of more than three people.
00:18:38.720,00:18:43.160,"So, to comply with the law, please now clump together in groups of three."
00:18:46.240,00:18:47.600,"You hear that, boys?"
00:18:47.680,00:18:54.040,"The same whistles they used to blow to send us over the top, they now blow to try and break us up."
00:18:54.120,00:18:58.760,"So before the Specials get here, raise a hand, all those who want to strike!"
00:19:02.160,00:19:03.720,"Now, disperse!"
00:19:03.800,00:19:06.480,Disperse and take the message home!
00:19:06.840,00:19:09.040,United we will never be defeated!
00:19:19.600,00:19:21.400,- Tommy! - Tommy.
00:19:23.720,00:19:26.680,The police have just raided a rally at the factory.
00:19:26.760,00:19:28.960,You think your Freddie Thorne's back?
00:19:29.040,00:19:35.480,I know he is and he's with Ada. How hard can it be to find the only girl in Birmingham with four-inch heels?
00:19:35.560,00:19:36.920,She's with the commies.
00:19:37.000,00:19:39.600,They have little rat holes all over the city.
00:19:39.920,00:19:41.880,I just want to know where she is.
00:19:41.960,00:19:44.920,"Tommy, you'd best have a word with Arthur as well."
00:19:45.000,00:19:47.360,What's wrong with bloody Arthur?
00:19:47.800,00:19:49.800,He's got the Flanders Blues again.
00:20:29.480,00:20:33.360,People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answer to.
00:20:37.920,00:20:40.320,Is it true your Ada got married?
00:20:42.440,00:20:43.880,"I say, I don't know."
00:20:46.160,00:20:48.120,Where is she living now?
00:20:50.240,00:20:51.680,I don't know.
00:20:53.640,00:21:00.360,"Arthur, who killed the Paddy from the Black Swan?"
00:21:02.920,00:21:05.320,"I go, What Paddy?"
00:21:09.520,00:21:19.080,"They say, Is it you Peaky Blinders, who stole the guns from the BSA?"
00:21:28.000,00:21:29.600,"What guns, Tommy?"
00:21:31.040,00:21:37.240,"Arthur, after your beating, I thought you needed a break-- What bloody guns, Tommy?"
00:21:39.400,00:21:41.320,"Arthur, I was going to tell you."
00:21:41.400,00:21:42.960,You were going to tell me.
00:21:43.080,00:21:45.400,"Arthur, listen to me."
00:21:47.320,00:21:51.080,You've had a hard time these past few years. God knows you have.
00:21:51.160,00:21:52.760,You deserve some rest.
00:21:55.200,00:22:00.080,We had some luck. Some bloody luck.
00:22:00.320,00:22:03.280,It fell off a wagon into our laps.
00:22:03.360,00:22:08.400,"And all you need to know is, it's us that has the machine guns now."
00:22:08.480,00:22:10.400,And it's them that's in the mud.
00:22:12.680,00:22:14.040,All right?
00:22:21.760,00:22:23.120,Come on.
00:22:24.200,00:22:27.440,I have a surprise for you. Come on.
00:22:52.080,00:22:54.960,A surprise? Where is she?
00:22:57.320,00:22:59.760,"What is it you've always wanted, Arthur?"
00:23:02.040,00:23:08.480,"When we were in France you used to say, When I get back to England, I want to own my own pub."
00:23:11.320,00:23:12.600,Well...
00:23:16.360,00:23:20.000,"Now you've gone soft. You've gone soft, Tommy."
00:23:23.040,00:23:25.280,How do we know it's for sale?
00:23:25.360,00:23:27.520,"Everything's for sale to us, Arthur."
00:23:28.880,00:23:31.520,We're making a lot of money these days.
00:23:31.600,00:23:35.400,We need a legitimate business to pass the money from the shop.
00:23:36.560,00:23:39.080,I wouldn't know what to do.
00:23:39.160,00:23:44.160,You spent two-thirds of your life in pubs. Just pour it instead of drinking it.
00:23:46.160,00:23:50.200,"- But I can still drink it, right? - Your pub, you do what you want."
00:23:58.720,00:23:59.920,What can I get you?
00:24:19.520,00:24:23.440,Bloody kids. The other one's punctured as well.
00:24:25.760,00:24:28.400,Mr. Campbell wants an explanation.
00:24:28.480,00:24:33.880,"Today, some rabble-rouser Union man brought the BSA out on strike."
00:24:35.440,00:24:37.960,It was Freddie Thorne.
00:24:38.040,00:24:40.680,I thought you promised he wouldn't come back.
00:24:40.760,00:24:43.480,I know he's in town. I'm dealing with it.
00:24:43.560,00:24:47.120,Mr. Campbell thought that you controlled your territories.
00:24:47.520,00:24:48.920,Yeah.
00:24:49.880,00:24:51.600,"I said, I'm dealing with it."
00:24:53.560,00:24:59.200,"I heard that, Freddie married your sister."
00:24:59.280,00:25:03.480,"Some family you've got, eh? I bet you can't wait for Christmas."
00:25:05.240,00:25:11.080,"Deliver Freddie Thorne to us, or we'll take your sister in as an accomplice."
00:25:11.160,00:25:13.320,She'll get four years for sedition.
00:25:15.600,00:25:19.080,Or you can turn him in. And your sister goes free.
00:25:27.240,00:25:29.320,"I'll say good night then, Tom."
00:25:55.960,00:25:58.640,- Have you seen Freddie Thorne? - No.
00:25:58.720,00:25:59.960,Or Tommy.
00:26:14.240,00:26:16.960,- I have to find Freddie. - Drink this first.
00:26:17.040,00:26:20.880,"No, I have to find them, I think they're going to kill each other."
00:26:20.960,00:26:22.840,Wait. Who is going to kill who?
00:26:24.000,00:26:25.280,We need to talk.
00:26:32.320,00:26:35.000,"What exactly is it that you want, Freddie?"
00:26:36.240,00:26:37.760,I came to tell you...
00:26:41.240,00:26:43.040,"That's not gonna work, Tommy."
00:26:45.400,00:26:48.360,Polly came round. She gave me that.
00:26:51.120,00:26:54.880,"Well, Polly must have had a rush of blood."
00:26:54.960,00:26:56.040,Or port wine.
00:26:56.120,00:26:57.840,Your honesty is appreciated.
00:26:57.920,00:27:00.640,"Now, if you're not going to use that thing..."
00:27:00.720,00:27:04.160,I'm not finished! Sit down.
00:27:04.280,00:27:05.600,Sit down. Sit!
00:27:11.600,00:27:13.520,Talk to me about the guns.
00:27:15.360,00:27:21.360,"Do you remember we used to jump in here and see who could swim-- I'm here to talk business, Tommy."
00:27:23.960,00:27:26.200,Do you reckon we could still do it?
00:27:40.320,00:27:44.280,"You loaded Ada with your bastard, because she's a Shelby."
00:27:45.840,00:27:49.320,You thought it would mean you'd be somebody.
00:27:50.120,00:27:53.600,I won't let you fuck up my sister's life for your cause.
00:27:58.040,00:27:59.480,My God.
00:28:04.280,00:28:06.320,You actually believe that.
00:28:16.040,00:28:19.040,I've loved her since she was nine and I was 12.
00:28:20.640,00:28:22.640,And she loves me the same.
00:28:30.680,00:28:32.760,Do you even know the word?
00:28:36.040,00:28:38.280,This marriage will not stand.
00:29:10.040,00:29:12.920,Freddie didn't want your money.
00:29:13.920,00:29:20.360,"And now the coppers are saying if we don't turn Freddie in, they'll put Ada on the arrest warrant as well."
00:29:20.440,00:29:23.280,"That's where your compassion gets you, Poll."
00:29:23.440,00:29:25.920,"From now on, we do it my way."
00:29:27.600,00:29:28.840,Or what?
00:30:07.320,00:30:08.600,Ready?
00:30:15.360,00:30:17.520,"- I'll lead. - Watch yourself, Danny."
00:30:17.600,00:30:18.880,Tommy...
00:30:26.720,00:30:28.120,"Be careful, Danny."
00:31:00.480,00:31:01.640,Tommy!
00:31:14.880,00:31:16.040,Tommy!
00:31:19.280,00:31:20.520,Tommy!
00:31:21.600,00:31:22.760,Tommy!
00:31:30.000,00:31:31.240,It's open.
00:31:37.240,00:31:39.320,"Private Whizz-Bang reporting, sir."
00:31:40.080,00:31:41.200,At ease.
00:31:55.360,00:31:57.600,"So, what news from London?"
00:31:58.440,00:32:00.200,I was in a pub.
00:32:00.280,00:32:04.240,It's called the Mother Redcap. An Irish pub.
00:32:04.440,00:32:07.960,I got talking to some old bloke about Birmingham.
00:32:08.040,00:32:11.080,He said there's been trouble. An IRA man shot.
00:32:12.720,00:32:19.360,"He said a lot, but the only bit I heard was that their high command think it's the Peaky Blinders who shot him."
00:32:19.920,00:32:22.320,I came up on the next boat to warn you.
00:32:23.640,00:32:24.880,Is it true?
00:32:26.160,00:32:27.160,No.
00:32:28.440,00:32:31.120,But lies travel faster than the truth.
00:32:33.680,00:32:36.160,Get a message to them.
00:32:36.240,00:32:38.560,Tell them to send someone to parley.
00:32:38.640,00:32:42.800,Tell them there's been a misunderstanding and we don't want any trouble.
00:32:45.360,00:32:47.720,"You've got enough trouble. Right, Tommy?"
00:32:49.360,00:32:52.120,The whiskey and the smoke.
00:32:57.480,00:32:59.360,I can smell it in the air.
00:33:02.520,00:33:04.520,I use it sometimes myself.
00:33:05.480,00:33:07.080,Call it my sweetheart.
00:33:10.520,00:33:12.680,"They gave us the worst job, Tommy."
00:33:13.680,00:33:14.960,Yeah.
00:33:16.360,00:33:18.600,And we fucking volunteered.
00:33:32.600,00:33:35.040,Sometimes it lasts all night.
00:33:37.360,00:33:45.960,"And I lie here and I listen to the shovels, and the picks against that wall there."
00:33:50.640,00:33:55.400,And I pray the sun will come up at the curtains before they break through.
00:33:57.160,00:33:59.440,"No, I don't pray."
00:33:59.520,00:34:00.840,I hope.
00:34:02.800,00:34:05.360,And sometimes it happens.
00:34:05.440,00:34:06.920,The sun beats them.
00:34:08.520,00:34:09.760,But mostly...
00:34:13.000,00:34:14.920,The shovels beat the sun.
00:35:36.040,00:35:37.880,Your sister was here.
00:35:42.640,00:35:44.560,She was worried. You and Freddie.
00:35:45.400,00:35:46.720,It had made her sick.
00:35:48.480,00:35:51.600,"She's all right, but in her condition she needs peace."
00:35:53.520,00:35:56.760,- Women talk. - That is something they do.
00:35:58.800,00:36:00.440,She talked about you.
00:36:02.720,00:36:05.080,She said you keep everything locked up.
00:36:05.920,00:36:08.480,"Well, that's what men do."
00:36:09.600,00:36:11.480,Your sister's nice. I like her.
00:36:12.200,00:36:14.080,It can't be easy for her.
00:36:14.160,00:36:17.480,Her brother and her husband fighting over the same thing.
00:36:22.080,00:36:23.720,"Men should talk, too."
00:36:25.000,00:36:26.240,To you?
00:36:29.000,00:36:33.080,Why not? I'm a barmaid. It's my job.
00:36:33.160,00:36:35.800,Men always tell their troubles to a barmaid.
00:36:37.080,00:36:39.840,What is it you and Freddie are fighting over?
00:36:52.600,00:36:55.640,I'll meet you here at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.
00:36:59.000,00:37:00.520,Did you buy a dress?
00:37:01.280,00:37:03.120,Yes. I bought a dress.
00:37:04.280,00:37:05.680,How does it look?
00:38:26.480,00:38:29.440,"So will it get me all the way to Cheltenham, Curly?"
00:38:29.520,00:38:31.800,He's good with motors but it pains him.
00:38:31.880,00:38:34.520,No heart in motorcars. I can't talk to them.
00:38:34.600,00:38:38.160,Yeah. Tommy might need to make a fast getaway.
00:38:38.240,00:38:40.320,The Lees will be all over the track.
00:38:40.400,00:38:42.800,And Kimber's men. And his coppers.
00:38:42.880,00:38:45.160,"They control the law down there, Tommy."
00:38:45.240,00:38:47.240,"Give her a turn for me, Charlie."
00:38:53.600,00:38:55.080,This car only seats four.
00:38:55.160,00:38:58.640,You'll need more men than that if you're to come back alive.
00:38:58.720,00:39:00.480,It'll be just me and a girl.
00:39:08.880,00:39:11.760,Is it just the two of us going to the races?
00:39:11.840,00:39:13.120,Something like that.
00:39:48.000,00:39:49.600,Attention!
00:39:50.040,00:39:51.200,Right.
00:39:51.280,00:39:56.240,This is what's known as your final briefing before going over the top.
00:39:56.320,00:39:59.360,Sixty miles down that road is Cheltenham racetrack.
00:39:59.440,00:40:01.960,"Johnny, what is our mission, boy?"
00:40:02.040,00:40:05.120,"To stick it to the Lee family, Arthur!"
00:40:05.200,00:40:06.600,That's right.
00:40:06.680,00:40:09.640,The Lees are skimming money off the legal bookies.
00:40:09.720,00:40:14.560,"Running chalk, selling rafflers, then beating up them as won't buy."
00:40:14.640,00:40:17.360,But today we're going to stop them.
00:40:17.440,00:40:21.000,What about Kimber's men? I thought he had his own protection.
00:40:21.080,00:40:24.160,Kimber has let his troops go rotten.
00:40:24.240,00:40:28.280,They're on the take from the Lees to look the other way.
00:40:28.360,00:40:31.160,We're gonna show Kimber how it should be done.
00:40:31.240,00:40:32.960,Now take what you're good at.
00:40:33.040,00:40:39.240,"Those of you with guns, keep them out of it unless a gun is pulled on you. We want this done quietly."
00:40:44.000,00:40:47.160,We don't. We're not keeping the cash.
00:40:47.240,00:40:49.320,"You're in Tommy's army now, boys."
00:40:50.280,00:40:51.680,Trust only kin.
00:40:53.480,00:40:54.680,Let's go.
00:41:14.800,00:41:16.920,Are you sure we're allowed in here?
00:41:17.000,00:41:19.880,"Well, I prefer to come to the races the back way."
00:41:19.960,00:41:24.000,It keeps me out of trouble. Tracks are lawless places.
00:41:24.080,00:41:26.800,I can't stand petty criminals. This way.
00:41:26.880,00:41:28.360,Will we get to lay a bet?
00:41:28.440,00:41:31.240,Nah. Gambling is for mugs. This way.
00:41:31.680,00:41:36.120,You're lucky you're with me or you'd be wasting your money on fixed races.
00:41:36.200,00:41:38.560,"I always wondered, how do you fix a race?"
00:41:38.640,00:41:40.080,How should I know?
00:41:43.080,00:41:46.040,"- Okay, you do the talking. - What?"
00:41:46.160,00:41:49.800,Tell security you are Lady Sarah Duggan-- Excuse us.
00:41:49.880,00:41:53.280,Excuse us. Lady Sarah Duggan of Connemara.
00:41:53.360,00:42:02.560,"You got lost when you went to look for the boy riding your horse, Dandy Flower. If they ask about me, say that I'm Prussian and don't speak a word of English."
00:42:35.600,00:42:37.360,I still prefer the Garrison.
00:42:40.960,00:42:42.320,Do you dance?
00:42:43.320,00:42:45.080,If I'm asked properly.
00:42:47.520,00:42:51.240,"Lady Sarah of Connemara, will you dance with me?"
00:43:50.200,00:43:53.400,"Roberts, the Peaky Blinders are here."
00:43:53.480,00:43:56.640,"I told you, Mr. Kimber. He's got some balls, that one."
00:43:56.720,00:43:58.760,"And she's got some body, that one."
00:44:12.000,00:44:15.600,Chalk for your blackboards. Five pounds a stick.
00:44:20.120,00:44:22.560,It's a pleasure doing business with you.
00:44:26.360,00:44:28.800,"Hello, Raz. How's business?"
00:44:34.880,00:44:36.200,Fucker! Get him!
00:44:46.000,00:44:52.080,"Stay still, Raz, or I'll take the whole ear off and you're going to need your ears to listen."
00:44:52.160,00:44:55.720,No more chalking on Billy Kimber's boys.
00:44:55.800,00:44:57.080,Right?
00:44:58.200,00:45:00.120,We are the protection now.
00:45:02.400,00:45:08.520,I commandeer this stolen money by order of the Peaky Blinders!
00:45:35.080,00:45:39.800,"Either your left leg is stronger than your right, or we're making a getaway."
00:45:39.880,00:45:41.000,Neither.
00:45:41.080,00:45:43.480,I hope this doesn't involve razor blades.
00:45:43.560,00:45:45.680,I've decided to move up in the world.
00:45:45.760,00:45:47.680,Become a legitimate businessman.
00:45:47.760,00:45:49.640,My gosh. You're serious.
00:45:49.720,00:45:51.160,I'm always serious.
00:45:53.760,00:45:57.200,We chased the Lees across the track and down to Devon road.
00:45:57.280,00:45:58.720,We got every penny back.
00:45:59.960,00:46:03.000,Nice dress. You can wear that to my pub.
00:46:03.120,00:46:05.280,Buy the boys a drink. Anybody hurt?
00:46:05.560,00:46:07.720,A few cuts and bruises.
00:46:07.800,00:46:09.480,"Off we go, Lady Sarah."
00:46:16.520,00:46:17.560,Steady on.
00:46:18.240,00:46:19.360,Excuse me.
00:46:27.200,00:46:29.000,"Your money, Mr. Kimber."
00:46:30.160,00:46:32.440,Rescued from the Lee brothers.
00:46:32.520,00:46:37.040,And returned to you with a request for a fair hearing.
00:46:37.200,00:46:40.440,"Your own protection is failing, Mr. Kimber."
00:46:40.520,00:46:42.520,Your boys are taking cuts.
00:46:43.480,00:46:50.680,"I want to suggest that from now on, you contract out your racetrack security to the Peaky Blinders."
00:46:50.760,00:46:53.680,"We would be saving you a lot of money, Mr. Kimber."
00:46:53.760,00:46:55.280,A lot of money.
00:46:55.360,00:47:00.840,"In return, you give us, five percent of the take."
00:47:00.920,00:47:10.160,"And three legal betting pitches at every race meeting, north of the River Severn, rising to six after one year if we are all satisfied with the service."
00:47:12.640,00:47:14.640,"What do you say, Mr. Kimber?"
00:47:19.000,00:47:21.720,I say you talk business to my accountant.
00:47:21.800,00:47:23.440,I want to dance.
00:47:35.040,00:47:38.360,Your man said it was all right for me to have this dance.
00:48:00.320,00:48:03.360,How many men can you put in the field at one time?
00:48:03.440,00:48:06.160,There's a lot of men out of work at the moment.
00:48:06.240,00:48:07.920,Two guards for every bookie.
00:48:08.000,00:48:09.440,At every meeting?
00:48:10.960,00:48:13.960,We have contacts with good people among the Gypsies.
00:48:14.040,00:48:16.840,We'll always know when the Lees plan to attack.
00:48:17.800,00:48:22.240,"With all the strikes and troubles, you can't really depend on the police."
00:48:22.320,00:48:24.560,"Anyway, we're more honest."
00:48:25.920,00:48:28.040,Looks like you two are making a deal.
00:48:28.120,00:48:29.480,We are making progress.
00:48:31.480,00:48:34.400,Then let me throw a small condition into the mix.
00:48:51.040,00:48:54.800,"So, listen, we're going to go for dinner at Kimber's house."
00:48:54.880,00:48:57.080,He has a place a couple of miles away.
00:48:57.160,00:49:02.880,"I have some business to settle first with his accountant, so, you go on ahead with Kimber."
00:49:03.920,00:49:05.480,Just me and him?
00:49:05.560,00:49:07.800,Yeah. Till I'm done here.
00:49:08.680,00:49:10.200,Is that all right?
00:49:12.200,00:49:15.680,"Look, I'll throw in an extra three quid for your extra time."
00:49:17.960,00:49:19.520,You think I'm a whore?
00:49:21.520,00:49:24.120,"Everyone's a whore, Grace."
00:49:24.200,00:49:26.640,We just sell different parts of ourselves.
00:49:26.720,00:49:30.800,You said you wanted to work for me. To do that you have to sharpen up.
00:49:30.880,00:49:33.880,The deal is I give him two hours with you.
00:49:33.960,00:49:37.320,He thinks he's a ladies' man. He thinks he can seduce you.
00:49:37.400,00:49:40.080,"Whenever you want, just kick him in the balls."
00:49:40.160,00:49:41.800,I'm a clause in a contract.
00:49:41.880,00:49:46.360,"If you want to be part of my organization, you have to make sacrifices."
00:49:49.400,00:49:50.640,Do we have a deal?
00:49:50.720,00:49:53.480,As a sweetener you can try your luck with mine.
00:49:54.400,00:49:55.760,"Yeah, we have a deal."
00:49:55.840,00:49:57.680,- Two hours? - Yeah.
00:49:57.840,00:50:00.800,Side bet. Ten pounds says I have her fucked in one.
00:50:02.960,00:50:04.240,Mademoiselle.
00:50:14.760,00:50:17.280,"I bet he said you could have me, didn't he?"
00:50:18.920,00:50:20.920,While he has her.
00:50:21.000,00:50:23.240,"That's the arrangement, isn't it?"
00:50:26.440,00:50:29.120,"Well, yours might be a prostitute but I'm not."
00:50:30.040,00:50:32.000,I was a milliner when I met him.
00:50:33.120,00:50:34.840,I was independent.
00:50:37.640,00:50:39.160,I made this hat.
00:50:40.440,00:50:41.960,I was a good milliner.
00:50:43.200,00:50:45.120,It's a very pretty hat.
00:50:46.960,00:50:48.360,Really is.
00:50:58.360,00:51:00.160,So is she a prostitute?
00:51:01.880,00:51:06.240,God's honest truth? I don't know what she is.
00:51:15.120,00:51:18.080,You showed me up back there at the races.
00:51:21.040,00:51:23.920,Why don't you teach me how to dance properly?
00:51:25.080,00:51:27.720,This music is too slow. Put on a Charleston.
00:51:27.800,00:51:31.040,"Well, then we'd be far away. I want to dance like this."
00:51:32.320,00:51:35.280,"Come on. You weren't so stiff back there, were you?"
00:51:37.160,00:51:39.200,You ever been in a house this big?
00:51:40.440,00:51:41.520,Hmm?
00:51:42.920,00:51:44.120,Look at you.
00:51:47.000,00:51:49.440,You look like a bloody film star.
00:51:54.080,00:51:55.480,I want a cigarette.
00:52:06.400,00:52:09.040,"Oh, look, I've dropped something. Pick it up."
00:52:09.120,00:52:12.040,- Pick it up yourself. - You're a fucking barmaid.
00:52:12.120,00:52:14.880,"If I drop a glass on the floor, you pick it up."
00:52:14.960,00:52:16.800,I want to watch you pick it up.
00:52:21.120,00:52:23.920,"Right, you little slag. I have tried to be nice."
00:52:25.640,00:52:34.480,"If I drop a glass on the floor, you bend over and fucking pick up the fucking glass. Okay?"
00:52:34.560,00:52:36.000,"- What? - No, sir, no."
00:52:36.080,00:52:38.800,What are you doing here? I've got another hour.
00:52:38.880,00:52:42.640,Just wait. Listen to me. Just listen to me.
00:52:42.720,00:52:48.280,"I was going to let you go through with it, but in the end, my conscience got the better of me."
00:52:48.360,00:52:50.360,She looks good on the outside.
00:52:51.840,00:52:53.560,But she has the clap.
00:52:56.160,00:52:57.800,Yeah. Syphilis.
00:52:58.280,00:53:01.280,"When you took a shine to her, I thought to use her."
00:53:01.360,00:53:04.960,"Somebody told me she had the syph, I thought, What the hell!"
00:53:06.520,00:53:08.360,Call it my better nature.
00:53:09.360,00:53:10.800,She's a whore.
00:53:16.200,00:53:18.120,"Now, just go and wait in the car."
00:53:18.200,00:53:19.840,I can walk on my own!
00:53:24.520,00:53:27.360,Can we shake hands and forget this ever happened?
00:53:51.720,00:53:54.760,Start of the day I was Lady Sarah of Connemara.
00:53:55.960,00:53:59.000,"By the end, I was a whore with the clap."
00:54:01.080,00:54:03.880,"You're a fucking bastard, offering me like that."
00:54:09.520,00:54:11.520,But then you changed your mind.
00:54:15.360,00:54:17.520,"Why did you change your mind, Thomas?"
00:01:55.960,00:01:58.840,We wait until the boy's in position.
00:11:50.800,00:11:53.040,A boy almost got killed.
00:11:56.240,00:11:57.240,A child.
00:12:07.680,00:12:10.640,I come here with a proposition.
00:12:14.440,00:12:16.200,I thought he was your ally.
00:12:16.840,00:12:18.880,I plan to betray him.
00:13:00.120,00:13:03.640,Let us talk family business.
00:00:15.480,00:00:17.000,"God, I'm getting big now."
00:00:40.120,00:00:44.680,"- So, how was London? - It's crackling with revolution."
00:00:44.840,00:00:46.920,The Poplar docks are on strike.
00:00:47.040,00:00:49.480,Did our friends give us what we asked for?
00:00:52.080,00:00:54.640,- How much? - Two hundred pounds.
00:00:54.720,00:00:56.400,Who did you meet?
00:00:56.480,00:00:58.600,An attache from the Russian embassy.
00:00:59.120,00:01:00.880,In a Chinese restaurant.
00:01:01.840,00:01:05.840,Our revolution is international. And it grows by the day.
00:01:21.480,00:01:23.720,"Jeremiah, Jeremiah... What do you see?"
00:01:24.640,00:01:27.320,Your sister and Freddie got back this morning.
00:01:27.400,00:01:31.240,"I tried following them, but Freddie's so good at getting away."
00:01:31.800,00:01:33.080,He's like a fish.
00:01:33.680,00:01:35.680,"Right, well, keep fishing, eh?"
00:01:55.960,00:01:58.520,We wait until the boy's in position.
00:02:06.600,00:02:09.800,"That's your starters, gentlemen. No more bets."
00:02:11.680,00:02:13.960,- I was here on time. - Finished.
00:02:14.040,00:02:17.520,"- I got a tip off, I need this bet. - The race has started."
00:02:17.600,00:02:18.640,- Please. - No!
00:02:42.640,00:02:45.520,"Night, lads. See you tomorrow."
00:03:05.800,00:03:08.080,- It's a good day. - Where's John?
00:03:08.160,00:03:09.840,John is in the Garrison.
00:03:09.920,00:03:12.760,He says he wants a meeting about a family matter.
00:03:13.360,00:03:17.800,After he's said his piece he'll come back and take his place with Scudboat.
00:03:17.880,00:03:20.400,Scudboat? John will be here in ten minutes.
00:03:20.480,00:03:22.600,- All right. - Five.
00:03:51.240,00:03:52.280,Wait.
00:04:00.360,00:04:01.960,Good boy.
00:04:19.920,00:04:21.000,John?
00:04:31.640,00:04:33.440,Put that down! Put that down!
00:04:35.440,00:04:36.840,This is for Cheltenham.
00:04:37.760,00:04:39.800,We're just taking back what's ours.
00:04:40.600,00:04:43.120,There's more money here. Search everywhere.
00:04:48.640,00:04:51.240,"All right John, there's only one man... No!"
00:04:51.320,00:04:53.640,There's only one man guarding the house.
00:04:54.200,00:04:55.720,What's troubling you?
00:04:57.680,00:05:01.600,"Polly, you know what it's been like. Since Martha died."
00:05:01.680,00:05:03.280,God takes the best first.
00:05:03.640,00:05:07.960,"Truth is, my kids have been running bloody rings around me."
00:05:13.640,00:05:16.920,"Pol, give him ten bob for some shoes. Is that it, John?"
00:05:17.000,00:05:19.880,"Tommy, it would be better to do this without you."
00:05:20.680,00:05:22.040,Now what's your point?
00:05:23.880,00:05:26.320,What the kids need is a mother.
00:05:29.480,00:05:31.560,So that's why I'm getting married.
00:05:32.920,00:05:39.200,"Does this poor girl know you're going to marry her, or are you going to spring it on her all of a sudden?"
00:05:39.480,00:05:41.760,"I already proposed and she said, Yes."
00:05:41.840,00:05:45.280,I think there's a shell about to land and go bang.
00:05:48.600,00:05:51.120,"It's, er... It's Lizzie Stark."
00:05:55.440,00:06:01.240,"John, Lizzie Stark is a strong woman, and I'm sure she provides a fine service for her customers."
00:06:01.320,00:06:06.760,I won't hear the word. Understand? Do not use that word.
00:06:06.840,00:06:08.440,"What word is that, John?"
00:06:09.040,00:06:10.720,You know what word that is.
00:06:10.800,00:06:14.360,- Everybody bloody knows. - Everybody can go to hell.
00:06:15.320,00:06:16.640,Whore. That word?
00:06:19.840,00:06:30.760,"Right. I want it known. If anyone calls her a whore again, I will push the barrel of my revolver down their throats, and blow the word back down into their hearts."
00:06:30.840,00:06:34.280,Men and their cocks never cease to amaze me.
00:06:34.360,00:06:37.480,"John, Lizzie Stark never did a day's work vertical..."
00:06:37.560,00:06:40.440,She's changed. All right. People change.
00:06:40.520,00:06:45.760,"- Like with religion. - Lizzie Stark has got religion, eh?"
00:06:45.840,00:06:50.320,"No! No, she doesn't have religion. But-- But she loves me."
00:06:51.040,00:06:55.600,"Now listen, Tommy. I won't do it without your blessing."
00:06:57.080,00:07:02.640,"But of all the people in the world, I want you to see it..."
00:07:03.920,00:07:06.760,"- As brave. - Oh, it's brave all right."
00:07:10.520,00:07:14.000,"And with Lizzy Stark, John that's not what you'll be doing."
00:07:14.080,00:07:16.560,"Listen, Tommy. Welcome her to the family."
00:07:17.360,00:07:19.560,As someone who's had a hard life.
00:07:20.960,00:07:22.960,All right? Because I need someone.
00:07:24.960,00:07:26.480,The kids need someone.
00:07:28.320,00:07:31.240,- Tommy! We've been done over! - What?
00:07:36.480,00:07:38.720,Jesus Christ!
00:07:38.800,00:07:41.000,What the bloody hell happened here?
00:07:44.040,00:07:47.360,"Cousins, nephews, even their bastards..."
00:07:53.040,00:07:54.120,Four cash boxes.
00:07:56.320,00:07:57.680,They left these.
00:07:57.760,00:08:00.720,Wire cutters. Why would they leave that?
00:08:00.800,00:08:01.840,Nobody move.
00:08:04.080,00:08:06.520,I think our friends are playing the game.
00:08:06.600,00:08:07.640,What game?
00:08:07.720,00:08:10.320,Aunt Pol. Don't touch anything.
00:08:12.560,00:08:14.120,Erasmus Lee was in France.
00:08:15.480,00:08:16.520,Shit...
00:08:20.960,00:08:29.160,"Whenever we gave up ground to the Germans, we'd leave behind booby traps, set up with wires."
00:08:29.240,00:08:32.400,We'd leave wire cutters as part of the joke.
00:08:33.640,00:08:36.000,Somewhere in here there's a hand grenade.
00:08:36.080,00:08:37.520,Holy Jesus.
00:08:39.360,00:08:41.080,Attached to a wire.
00:08:43.159,00:08:47.320,Don't move any chairs or open any doors.
00:08:50.920,00:08:53.040,"Go easy, John Boy. Go easy."
00:08:53.120,00:08:54.400,No.
00:08:54.480,00:08:56.920,"Boys, no. It's not in here."
00:08:58.720,00:09:01.440,"If it was in here, it would have blown by now."
00:09:01.520,00:09:05.040,It was my name on that bullet Erasmus sent.
00:09:06.320,00:09:08.120,He's set up a trap all right.
00:09:11.120,00:09:13.040,But he's set it up just for me.
00:09:26.200,00:09:27.240,Finn.
00:09:29.200,00:09:31.200,Finn stay exactly where you are.
00:09:32.680,00:09:34.320,I was pretending I was you.
00:09:37.120,00:09:39.280,Which door did you open to come in?
00:09:39.360,00:09:41.400,I didn't. I climbed in.
00:09:42.880,00:09:48.080,"I want you to climb out exactly the same way you climbed in, okay?"
00:09:49.440,00:09:50.600,No. Finn.
00:09:52.960,00:09:54.040,Clear!
00:10:00.440,00:10:01.760,It could've killed us.
00:10:17.120,00:10:21.520,"That's why you should never pretend to be me, okay?"
00:10:21.640,00:10:22.760,Okay?
00:10:59.880,00:11:01.920,I got you ten minutes with her.
00:11:03.920,00:11:07.880,You could say thank you. It's easier to see the Pope these days.
00:11:39.200,00:11:41.440,Put your hand on the Bible.
00:11:41.520,00:11:42.720,I don't believe.
00:11:47.560,00:11:49.560,This war is cutting us all off.
00:11:50.680,00:11:53.240,A boy almost got killed.
00:11:56.160,00:11:57.280,A child.
00:11:57.360,00:11:58.880,You're all children.
00:11:59.440,00:12:01.120,I say enough.
00:12:01.200,00:12:04.040,Your boys tried to kill me and it didn't work.
00:12:07.680,00:12:10.400,I come here with a proposition.
00:12:14.480,00:12:16.320,I thought he was your ally.
00:12:16.840,00:12:19.000,I plan to betray him.
00:12:19.400,00:12:21.800,No wonder you won't touch a Bible.
00:12:21.880,00:12:25.400,- I have ambitions. - You want to play a switch.
00:12:25.480,00:12:27.800,- I need your boys. - For what?
00:12:27.880,00:12:31.960,Kimber's not the brains. There's a gadze who runs the races.
00:12:32.040,00:12:36.320,I'm collecting smart people. But I need strong men too.
00:12:36.400,00:12:38.920,Now your boys should know this.
00:12:39.000,00:12:45.600,We get the winner in one of every three races before the race even starts. No need for chalkers or rafflers.
00:12:45.680,00:12:47.120,I'm talking certainties.
00:12:47.200,00:12:52.560,"You're saying you're going to do someone down, and in the same breath ask me to trust you."
00:12:54.800,00:12:57.480,"On my mother's side, we are kin."
00:13:00.160,00:13:03.760,Let us talk family business.
00:13:12.880,00:13:14.440,"Ada, can you do my back?"
00:13:17.720,00:13:18.760,Ada?
00:13:20.840,00:13:22.760,I know what was in the envelope.
00:13:23.680,00:13:25.960,I looked. Money.
00:13:26.040,00:13:31.920,"That bloke we met in London you said was a Frenchman, he was Russian. I'm not an idiot, Freddie."
00:13:37.280,00:13:41.120,- It's money for the cause. - You're blind.
00:13:41.200,00:13:44.200,I'd be if your brothers had anything to do with it.
00:13:44.280,00:13:46.760,This isn't about them. This is about you.
00:13:46.840,00:13:49.800,And me. And this.
00:13:53.040,00:13:55.000,"You're a dreamer, Freddie."
00:13:56.640,00:13:59.200,You give money away while we rot in here.
00:14:00.840,00:14:03.200,And you talk about revolution.
00:14:04.000,00:14:05.240,I need to know.
00:14:09.240,00:14:11.480,"Who are you loyal to, Freddie?"
00:14:14.720,00:14:16.880,"I said, who are you loyal to?"
00:14:55.440,00:14:57.680,Did you have something to do with this?
00:14:59.440,00:15:01.800,I asked an acquaintance for an address.
00:15:01.880,00:15:04.760,She said she would only give it to me anonymously.
00:15:04.840,00:15:06.880,She is afraid of the consequences.
00:15:08.480,00:15:09.760,Whose address is it?
00:15:10.760,00:15:13.000,"Tommy, I'd like to suggest a strategy."
00:15:34.080,00:15:37.280,"Your message said, you have an address for me."
00:15:42.200,00:15:43.720,Anonymous tip off.
00:15:45.120,00:15:47.080,The address of Stanley Chapman.
00:15:48.880,00:15:53.120,- You promised me Freddie Thorne. - This is instead of Freddie Thorne.
00:15:53.800,00:15:54.880,No deal.
00:15:54.960,00:15:58.960,"Inspector, Stanley Chapman is a bigger fish than Freddie Thorne."
00:16:01.680,00:16:05.080,He is currently holding 200 pounds in cash.
00:16:05.160,00:16:08.600,Given to the Communist party by the Russian Government.
00:16:10.480,00:16:16.080,"That's right, Chapman has snow on his boots, and all you need is a shovel."
00:16:17.240,00:16:19.560,"If he talks, you'll have proof."
00:16:20.920,00:16:22.760,You might even get that medal.
00:16:24.480,00:16:37.600,"Now, before I give you the address, I want your word, that you will let Freddie Thorne and my sister leave the city."
00:16:41.200,00:16:43.400,Very well. You have my word.
00:16:48.840,00:16:53.080,"Our little truce is proving quite productive for both of us, Inspector."
00:16:54.760,00:16:59.880,I get the information and protection and you...
00:17:01.640,00:17:02.840,Well...
00:17:04.200,00:17:05.800,You get Bolsheviks.
00:17:10.520,00:17:18.880,"But on a more pressing matter, I'm afraid Mr Churchill is becoming impatient."
00:17:20.599,00:17:29.640,"And I fear that if you don't get back those stolen weapons soon, I will be replaced."
00:17:29.720,00:17:32.400,It would be the finish of me. That's for sure.
00:17:32.480,00:17:36.360,"When my business with Kimber is done, the guns will be returned."
00:17:36.440,00:17:40.040,- That was the deal. - Then I am in your hands. Completely.
00:17:41.760,00:17:43.440,You hold all the cards.
00:17:52.560,00:17:54.040,I say this for your sake.
00:17:54.120,00:18:04.720,"Because, if I were to be fired and it were your fault, I would do things that would shame the devil."
00:18:07.000,00:18:09.640,My fury is a thing to behold.
00:18:11.480,00:18:22.640,"On my last day in power for example, I would see to it that you and your scum brothers have your heads, stoved in with mallets and spades."
00:18:24.520,00:18:27.080,And your sister too.
00:18:27.160,00:18:31.320,The baby inside her would be of no consequence to me.
00:18:31.400,00:18:37.320,"The only one to be spared would be your little brother, Finn."
00:18:37.440,00:18:49.760,"He would however be lifted as a juvenile, and dumped into that part of the adult prison, where men have the most appetite for boys like him."
00:18:51.360,00:18:54.960,"That would be a dark day indeed, Mr. Shelby."
00:18:56.240,00:18:59.560,If my dismissal comes before your decision.
00:19:00.520,00:19:01.880,Do you understand?
00:19:04.440,00:19:06.160,Know this...
00:19:08.480,00:19:09.880,The clock is ticking.
00:19:58.760,00:20:00.360,"Stanley, it's the police."
00:20:01.400,00:20:02.840,"Stanley, get here."
00:20:17.320,00:20:18.720,Look what we found.
00:20:20.200,00:20:22.840,Stanley Chapman does have snow on his boots.
00:20:32.840,00:20:34.120,Mr. Chapman...
00:20:36.040,00:20:37.640,You are fucked!
00:20:57.640,00:21:03.040,"I'm sure with a little persuasion, he'll tell us everything he knows."
00:21:03.120,00:21:06.240,Including the whereabouts of Freddie Thorne.
00:21:07.160,00:21:10.520,- Sir? - Your face is a picture.
00:21:10.600,00:21:12.760,I thought you had done a deal.
00:21:12.840,00:21:15.720,- Is that what you thought? - You gave your word.
00:21:17.240,00:21:18.880,My word?
00:21:22.080,00:21:25.800,Do people still talk about such things in this idiotic century?
00:21:25.880,00:21:28.160,My word to whom?
00:21:29.440,00:21:30.920,To a Peaky Blinder?
00:21:32.720,00:21:39.720,"Now, interrogate Mr. Chapman until he tells us, where we can find Freddie Thorne and his wife."
00:21:40.440,00:21:43.480,The source of the money is of secondary importance.
00:21:45.880,00:21:49.360,You think my campaign against Shelby has become personal?
00:21:50.200,00:21:51.840,Correct.
00:21:51.920,00:21:54.560,"'Spot on', as they say in London society."
00:21:55.800,00:22:03.120,"Now, go and interrogate Mr Chapman, and do not make the mistake of being too gentle."
00:22:04.600,00:22:05.800,"Right, sir."
00:22:37.920,00:22:39.320,Today's her birthday.
00:22:42.120,00:22:44.280,I know you never miss it.
00:22:44.360,00:22:46.400,Then I'm lucky you're not a copper.
00:22:47.040,00:22:49.720,- What do you want? - I came to warn you.
00:22:53.760,00:22:57.240,How do you know? The police don't spill that information.
00:22:57.320,00:22:59.680,It was me and Tommy who tipped them off.
00:22:59.760,00:23:04.760,"In return for safe passage for you and Ada, Tommy gave them Stanley and the money."
00:23:04.840,00:23:06.560,Money? What money?
00:23:09.840,00:23:12.880,- Who told you about the money? - Who do you think?
00:23:14.520,00:23:19.840,It was Ada's idea. That's how desperate she is to get out of that rat hole you're in.
00:23:22.960,00:23:26.160,She didn't want to be here when you found out.
00:23:26.240,00:23:29.720,Sometimes the women have to take over. Like in the war.
00:23:29.800,00:23:33.640,You fucking Shelbys-- Don't swear over your mother's grave.
00:23:34.880,00:23:38.400,You play your tune and expect the whole world to dance to it.
00:23:38.480,00:23:40.280,You don't have time for this.
00:23:41.560,00:23:43.560,You did a deal? For me?
00:23:43.640,00:23:45.520,Don't flatter yourself. For Ada.
00:23:45.600,00:23:48.640,And you think this copper will keep his word.
00:23:48.720,00:23:51.640,"If he doesn't, Chapman will give you up."
00:23:51.720,00:23:54.440,You'll still have to leave town. Same result.
00:23:55.640,00:23:57.960,- So neat. - So leave.
00:23:58.040,00:24:00.720,Except there's one thing that you got wrong.
00:24:00.800,00:24:04.520,He won't be able to give up my address. He doesn't know it.
00:24:04.600,00:24:06.160,That's how it works.
00:24:06.240,00:24:08.520,None of us know each other's addresses.
00:24:09.520,00:24:11.520,So you wasted your fucking time.
00:24:12.840,00:24:17.240,They'll keep beating him and beating him for information he doesn't have.
00:24:17.320,00:24:20.880,So all you've done is sign the death warrant of a good man.
00:24:22.520,00:24:23.760,So you won't leave.
00:24:35.280,00:24:39.120,"You lay a hand on our Ada, I'll put you in a wooden box myself."
00:24:49.960,00:24:52.280,"You raised a stubborn one there, Irene."
00:25:23.600,00:25:25.600,He had some kind of seizure.
00:25:34.640,00:25:36.240,Did he give you an address?
00:25:37.320,00:25:40.440,What's the matter with you? He fell down some stairs.
00:25:40.560,00:25:42.400,This is not bloody Belfast!
00:25:42.480,00:25:46.000,"Not yet! But if men like him get their way, it soon will be."
00:25:46.080,00:25:50.760,"So find some stairs, throw him down, and call the coroner."
00:25:52.480,00:25:54.240,Use Grayson.
00:25:54.320,00:26:01.280,"If he has any awkward questions, ask about the welfare of his mistress in Salteley. That will shut him up."
00:26:10.560,00:26:12.120,Bloody animals.
00:26:12.200,00:26:15.400,But the Shelby's are doing an excellent job for us.
00:26:20.960,00:26:24.360,- The bookies are purring. - So we throw the dog a bone.
00:26:25.400,00:26:26.680,I think so.
00:26:33.360,00:26:36.760,Mr Kimber. Mr Roberts. Come and have a look around.
00:26:44.120,00:26:45.320,After you.
00:26:48.040,00:26:50.920,with what you've had for lunch. Get back to work.
00:26:54.240,00:26:56.560,We heard the Lees had turned you over.
00:26:56.640,00:26:59.160,"You shouldn't listen to gossip, Mr Kimber."
00:27:01.880,00:27:03.120,Business is good.
00:27:04.880,00:27:08.840,Since you know which horse is going to win before you set the odds.
00:27:08.920,00:27:11.440,Your information is very much appreciated.
00:27:13.440,00:27:14.840,"So, where are they?"
00:27:16.320,00:27:18.920,"John, Lovelock, Scudboat. In here."
00:27:24.400,00:27:26.000,This is my team.
00:27:26.080,00:27:29.000,They'll take up their pitch at your convenience.
00:27:30.040,00:27:32.400,John is the book. Scudboat the bag man.
00:27:32.480,00:27:35.120,And of course we bring our own protection.
00:27:37.720,00:27:42.120,Warwick. Next Saturday. At least 50 yards from the beer tent.
00:28:08.560,00:28:10.080,Gentlemen...
00:28:11.520,00:28:12.640,...and Lady.
00:28:13.840,00:28:18.160,I have in my hand a legal betting license.
00:28:18.240,00:28:20.120,Issued by the board of control.
00:28:21.760,00:28:27.720,The Shelby family has its first legal racetrack pitch.
00:28:37.520,00:28:40.000,"Congratulations, there you go."
00:28:43.800,00:28:46.480,Thirty. Forty. Fifty.
00:28:53.760,00:28:56.600,"These cigarettes have a strange smell, Arthur."
00:28:56.680,00:28:59.320,They smell like rotting water.
00:28:59.400,00:29:01.840,And look. Rats have got at some of them.
00:29:03.320,00:29:06.600,"- They're stolen, aren't they? - Don't ask."
00:29:06.680,00:29:09.800,- You keep them on a boat. - What do you care?
00:29:09.880,00:29:12.040,"Can you check my adding up, please?"
00:29:17.280,00:29:19.960,You should make a new start with this place.
00:29:20.040,00:29:23.800,Do it properly. These cigarettes are not fit to sell.
00:29:23.880,00:29:25.200,Smells like Gallipoli.
00:29:25.280,00:29:27.720,You should find a new place to store them.
00:29:27.800,00:29:30.480,It has to be far away from coppers.
00:29:30.560,00:29:33.640,"- But not rats? - All the wharfs have rats, Grace."
00:29:35.400,00:29:38.720,- What's wrong with a dry warehouse? - Tommy's orders.
00:29:40.480,00:29:41.920,What orders?
00:29:42.000,00:29:45.040,Always keep Contraband near to petrol boat moorings.
00:29:45.960,00:29:47.440,Don't boats get searched?
00:29:47.520,00:29:52.240,"We moor them at junctions, so there's more than one way out."
00:29:52.320,00:29:56.240,No locks within a mile so we can move stuff fast.
00:29:56.960,00:30:00.040,"Your brother doesn't obey the law, but he has rules."
00:30:00.160,00:30:01.680,He's a very precise man.
00:30:02.200,00:30:04.960,- Is my adding up right? - It is now.
00:30:10.680,00:30:13.240,Three.And four.
00:30:14.560,00:30:16.280,We'll search them one by one.
00:30:22.880,00:30:26.360,"Please Lord, let that which I seek be found here."
00:30:42.560,00:30:46.600,"Not so much as a bullet, sir. Just more cigarettes and whisky."
00:31:00.520,00:31:02.960,About how we run our business.
00:31:03.120,00:31:06.040,And how we get our booze and where we keep it.
00:31:06.120,00:31:07.600,I'm just trying to help.
00:31:10.680,00:31:12.520,Let's you and me go for a walk.
00:31:13.440,00:31:15.720,- Where to? - Come on.
00:31:25.280,00:31:27.000,Why here?
00:31:29.040,00:31:31.400,"You're a good Catholic girl, aren't you?"
00:31:33.520,00:31:34.960,Yes.
00:31:35.040,00:31:38.280,"Well, then you know it's here people come to confess."
00:31:39.240,00:31:40.680,After you.
00:31:51.880,00:31:53.360,"Well, here it is, Grace."
00:31:55.400,00:31:56.440,I'll confess.
00:31:58.720,00:32:00.240,I need someone.
00:32:02.120,00:32:04.960,Kimber has an adviser by the name of Roberts.
00:32:08.520,00:32:10.840,He runs the legal side of the business.
00:32:11.880,00:32:13.480,And you need a Roberts.
00:32:14.680,00:32:16.880,Arthur tells me you have ideas.
00:32:16.960,00:32:19.080,I'm not an accountant. Nor a lawyer.
00:32:19.160,00:32:20.240,No.
00:32:20.880,00:32:22.680,But you have something I need.
00:32:23.920,00:32:24.960,Class.
00:32:26.800,00:32:29.840,I need someone who looks right at the big meetings.
00:32:29.920,00:32:31.440,"Epsom, Ascot."
00:32:31.520,00:32:32.960,Is this a job interview?
00:32:33.040,00:32:35.320,Arthur says you're good with numbers.
00:32:35.400,00:32:38.240,"Well, that's relative. He is quite poor."
00:32:38.600,00:32:41.760,- You keep the books in order. - They were chaotic.
00:32:42.520,00:32:44.120,But you are a liar.
00:32:49.440,00:32:54.240,No Catholic girl would enter a church and forget to make the sign of the cross.
00:32:55.920,00:32:57.360,You are very perceptive.
00:32:57.440,00:33:00.040,You lied about the pub you used worked in.
00:33:00.880,00:33:02.920,Now I find out you are Protestant.
00:33:05.440,00:33:07.560,- Do you care? - No.
00:33:08.440,00:33:09.560,I lied to fit in.
00:33:10.600,00:33:13.680,You pull a pint like someone who's thinking about it.
00:33:13.760,00:33:16.680,"This is not an interview, it is an interrogation."
00:33:16.760,00:33:17.960,Sit down.
00:33:23.840,00:33:25.280,"Look, Grace..."
00:33:26.880,00:33:29.440,You washed up in a place you don't belong.
00:33:29.520,00:33:30.760,For whatever reason.
00:33:32.240,00:33:35.000,- My good fortune. - And perhaps mine.
00:33:41.240,00:33:43.720,You know that most of what I do is illegal?
00:33:45.480,00:33:47.800,You'd still be willing to work for me?
00:33:50.360,00:33:52.080,Are you offering me the job?
00:33:56.520,00:33:57.560,Then I accept.
00:33:59.400,00:34:01.720,There's something else you should know.
00:34:03.080,00:34:06.560,A very important detail about my reasons for employing you.
00:34:27.159,00:34:28.600,You disappoint me.
00:34:32.080,00:34:33.440,Do you resign?
00:34:35.800,00:34:36.840,No.
00:34:38.080,00:34:40.760,My appetite for the work has only increased.
00:34:47.239,00:34:49.080,Tomorrow I'll show you around.
00:35:03.760,00:35:04.880,"Hello, Lizzie."
00:35:06.720,00:35:08.560,"That bag looks heavy, jump in."
00:35:09.200,00:35:12.160,- Kids' teas. - You like kids?
00:35:12.240,00:35:15.320,- Yeah. - Good. John's got four of them.
00:35:16.800,00:35:20.000,I'm not going to try to talk you out of it.
00:35:36.720,00:35:38.080,I just want to talk.
00:35:38.800,00:35:40.200,You're not against us?
00:35:40.840,00:35:42.120,John's his own man.
00:35:43.320,00:35:45.080,And you are your own woman.
00:35:49.000,00:35:54.880,"Now, Lizzie, since I came back from France, I've come to you on many occasions."
00:35:56.560,00:35:59.680,"- Tommy, you didn't tell him. - No, I didn't tell him."
00:36:00.640,00:36:02.480,Just like you didn't tell him.
00:36:03.800,00:36:06.200,"Now why didn't you tell him, Lizzie?"
00:36:06.280,00:36:11.520,Why didn't you tell him that you'd been serving his brother for the past two years?
00:36:12.680,00:36:14.440,Because the past is the past.
00:36:16.200,00:36:18.640,I don't want to lose him. He's a good man.
00:36:19.560,00:36:23.280,That's the answer I was hoping you'd give. The past is the past.
00:36:23.360,00:36:25.520,You see our John says you've changed.
00:36:25.600,00:36:28.440,And I believe him. And that's good.
00:36:28.520,00:36:29.920,Change is good.
00:36:31.720,00:36:33.520,These are new times I'm told.
00:36:37.400,00:36:39.280,I wish you both every happiness.
00:36:40.520,00:36:45.400,And I want you to see that as my wedding gift to you.
00:36:46.560,00:36:49.440,And our farewell to pleasures gone by.
00:37:02.320,00:37:05.840,You mean... One last time?
00:37:08.120,00:37:10.320,One last time. You and me.
00:37:13.600,00:37:15.480,It's eight bloody pounds.
00:37:35.360,00:37:36.840,So where shall we go?
00:37:39.840,00:37:41.840,Tommy? Shall we go to my lodging?
00:37:45.360,00:37:47.280,So the past is not the past.
00:37:50.240,00:37:52.720,You can keep the money. Get out of the car.
00:37:52.840,00:37:55.120,"- Tommy, please. - Get out of the car."
00:37:55.200,00:37:56.960,"I love him, Tommy. Really."
00:37:58.360,00:37:59.400,Really.
00:38:07.240,00:38:09.200,John will make his own decision.
00:38:10.600,00:38:12.400,But he will have the facts.
00:38:14.920,00:38:17.480,Your brother is ten times the man you are!
00:38:50.760,00:38:53.320,He is obviously not stupid.
00:38:53.400,00:38:55.960,All we found was stolen tobacco and whisky.
00:38:56.040,00:38:57.480,Which you left in place.
00:38:57.560,00:39:00.560,Of course. I would never endanger you.
00:39:05.920,00:39:07.560,"You are doing well, Grace."
00:39:09.320,00:39:11.840,I've been working on Arthur. He is easier.
00:39:11.920,00:39:14.640,- Than Thomas. - Yes.
00:39:14.720,00:39:15.920,Less intelligent.
00:39:17.040,00:39:18.520,Yes.
00:39:18.600,00:39:21.040,Is that a word you would use about Thomas?
00:39:21.120,00:39:22.160,It's your word.
00:39:24.680,00:39:26.920,He has promoted me.
00:39:27.000,00:39:30.000,He wants me to be his bookkeeper and secretary.
00:39:31.720,00:39:35.120,A cutthroat gangster with a secretary.
00:39:35.200,00:39:38.600,The pretensions of these hoodlums are quite breathtaking.
00:39:39.240,00:39:42.600,- Are they not? - Yes. Quite breathtaking.
00:39:45.920,00:39:49.000,He has obviously fallen quite heavily for you.
00:39:49.080,00:39:51.000,I thought you would be pleased.
00:39:52.240,00:39:54.520,Remember who you're dealing with here.
00:39:54.600,00:39:57.640,A man who cuts off ears and cuts out tongues.
00:39:58.240,00:40:00.080,"I know what he is, Sir."
00:40:02.240,00:40:07.200,"The difficulty with undercover work, Grace, is to remember what you are."
00:40:08.520,00:40:11.040,I come here with good news and I get this.
00:40:14.880,00:40:15.920,Grace.
00:40:33.680,00:40:35.320,Tommy.
00:40:35.400,00:40:38.480,I need a favor. I want to borrow the car.
00:40:38.600,00:40:41.600,I want to take Lizzie to the country with the kids.
00:40:41.680,00:40:44.280,We're going to celebrate getting the license.
00:40:44.360,00:40:45.640,"Not a problem, John."
00:40:46.840,00:40:48.200,I'll need the keys.
00:40:50.640,00:40:52.560,"Look, John, you're my brother."
00:40:54.600,00:40:56.840,There's something I have to tell you.
00:40:58.160,00:41:03.600,"Yesterday, on the front seat of that car, I offered Lizzie some money."
00:41:05.000,00:41:08.160,"And John? She said, Yes."
00:41:10.360,00:41:13.520,Now that's a fact. You do with it what you want.
00:41:14.480,00:41:17.880,Take the keys. Take Lizzie to the country.
00:41:17.960,00:41:20.240,Marry her if you want.
00:41:22.000,00:41:23.480,But you have to know.
00:41:24.960,00:41:26.080,"She said, Yes."
00:42:09.680,00:42:11.240,Get another glass.
00:42:21.240,00:42:23.440,You make a toast?
00:42:23.520,00:42:26.640,"I'm Irish, I can make a million toasts."
00:42:26.720,00:42:31.040,May you be in heaven a full half hour before the devil knows you're dead.
00:42:37.400,00:42:38.960,What are we celebrating?
00:42:39.040,00:42:41.840,Contract of employment.
00:42:43.320,00:42:46.200,Bookkeeper. Shelby Brothers Limited.
00:42:46.280,00:42:49.040,I don't like that word 'limited'.
00:42:49.120,00:42:51.600,"To be respectable, you have to be limited."
00:42:51.680,00:42:53.080,That's what worries me.
00:42:54.720,00:42:56.360,I had the phone put in.
00:42:58.280,00:42:59.320,It's in the back.
00:43:01.560,00:43:05.560,"If we knew someone else who had a phone, we could call them."
00:43:07.520,00:43:13.760,"And since we are celebrating, I had this delivered from Rackhams department store."
00:43:17.200,00:43:18.920,Aren't you going to open it?
00:43:20.280,00:43:23.760,No. Save it. For a special occasion.
00:43:25.680,00:43:30.760,"Right, your first job for the company. I want you to get that to my sister."
00:43:30.840,00:43:32.040,You don't see her?
00:43:32.120,00:43:34.720,No one does. She is hiding from me.
00:43:36.600,00:43:40.280,I am told she goes to a bathhouse on Montague Street.
00:43:40.360,00:43:42.400,On woman only days.
00:43:42.480,00:43:45.680,"She goes in disguise, so I need to get someone inside."
00:43:45.760,00:43:47.120,What am I delivering?
00:43:49.480,00:43:52.120,It's an invitation to a family occasion.
00:43:52.200,00:43:55.760,I want her there. So tell her there will be a truce.
00:43:55.840,00:43:57.760,Am I delivering bait for a trap?
00:43:58.680,00:44:05.400,"If you check that contract, you'll find it doesn't say anything about asking questions. Give her the invitation."
00:44:06.880,00:44:09.800,"And put that thing in the cupboard, until I say."
00:44:51.240,00:44:52.520,"What the hell, John?"
00:44:52.600,00:44:55.320,I couldn't get it lit. Couldn't even do that.
00:44:55.400,00:44:57.640,Why would you want to be smoking that?
00:44:57.720,00:45:00.240,Same reason as you. Pain in the head.
00:45:11.360,00:45:14.920,I spoke to Lizzie. I told her what you told me.
00:45:17.640,00:45:20.120,"She said, Your brother is a dirty liar."
00:45:21.560,00:45:24.400,But then I spoke to her sister and her cousin.
00:45:24.480,00:45:26.240,Bought them a couple drinks.
00:45:27.200,00:45:29.440,"Just a few of regulars, they said."
00:45:30.240,00:45:31.400,That's all.
00:45:33.240,00:45:37.360,"To keep the wolf from the door, she still sees a couple of regulars."
00:45:51.080,00:45:56.760,"I think you're the first Shelby in history, to have a legal license for anything."
00:45:59.360,00:46:04.920,"What would our granddad say, eh? He'd be turning in his grave."
00:46:05.000,00:46:10.520,Honest bloody money? Eh? In this house? In here?
00:46:10.600,00:46:13.360,You always used to do voices when we were kids.
00:46:16.800,00:46:18.720,"Well, we're not kids now, John."
00:46:21.640,00:46:24.680,"But we still have to look out for each other, right?"
00:46:26.800,00:46:28.040,Yeah.
00:46:29.720,00:46:32.960,Yeah. Come on. Go home.
00:46:33.960,00:46:38.320,Get some sleep. We've got a big day tomorrow.
00:46:38.600,00:46:39.680,We have?
00:46:41.440,00:46:44.840,Tomorrow we finish the war with the Lees once and for all.
00:46:46.520,00:46:48.760,- Since when? - Since just now.
00:46:50.000,00:46:51.400,Ten o'clock tomorrow.
00:46:54.160,00:46:55.640,Be ready for anything.
00:47:04.040,00:47:05.600,Out you get boys.
00:47:11.040,00:47:13.480,"- John, ready? - Yeah, I'm fine."
00:47:13.560,00:47:14.600,Have a drink.
00:47:23.000,00:47:26.680,What? Why are you all staring at me for? What?
00:47:26.760,00:47:28.360,Good. Let's go.
00:47:30.360,00:47:31.640,What?
00:47:42.120,00:47:45.080,"Tommy, what's your plan? We are in shotgun range."
00:47:49.160,00:47:53.440,"John, before we go into battle..."
00:47:53.520,00:47:55.840,There's something you're going to need.
00:47:57.680,00:47:59.640,"What are you bloody doing, Tommy?"
00:48:02.080,00:48:04.080,"Smile, John, it's a wedding."
00:48:04.160,00:48:05.440,Whose bloody wedding?
00:48:05.520,00:48:08.120,"Now if we'd told you, you wouldn't have come."
00:48:08.200,00:48:11.600,There's a girl from the Lee family who's going a bit wild.
00:48:11.680,00:48:13.560,And she needs marrying her off.
00:48:13.640,00:48:16.120,"- Ah, fuck! - John boy, John, boy!"
00:48:16.200,00:48:17.280,John!
00:48:17.360,00:48:19.440,"You have no bloody right, Tommy!"
00:48:19.520,00:48:21.600,Listen to me. Listen to me.
00:48:23.160,00:48:26.240,A girl who needs a husband. A man who needs a wife.
00:48:27.720,00:48:32.720,"Tom, I'm not bloody marrying some fucking mushroom picker..."
00:48:36.600,00:48:39.080,I have already betrothed you.
00:48:43.560,00:48:45.320,It's gonna make the Somme...
00:48:45.400,00:48:47.920,It'll make the Somme look like a tea party.
00:48:55.600,00:48:57.880,"Now, it's up to you John."
00:48:57.960,00:49:01.080,War or peace.
00:49:04.480,00:49:05.720,Let go of me.
00:49:19.080,00:49:20.400,Right.
00:49:20.480,00:49:23.720,You should see the size of her dowry.
00:49:23.800,00:49:25.560,Her what?
00:49:25.640,00:49:27.360,Her dad is giving you a car.
00:49:36.640,00:49:37.760,Will he do?
00:49:44.280,00:49:45.320,He'll do.
00:49:53.800,00:49:54.840,Here she is.
00:49:57.080,00:50:00.400,Come here. Go on.
00:50:11.720,00:50:14.480,this man and this woman.
00:50:16.040,00:50:17.760,You look well.
00:50:17.840,00:50:20.280,...and harmony and togetherness.
00:50:22.600,00:50:27.920,"Which is sanctioned and honored by the presence, and power of these two families around us."
00:50:30.360,00:50:35.680,Do you John Michael Shelby take Esme Martha Lee to be your beautiful wife?
00:50:35.760,00:50:37.240,You got my invitation.
00:50:37.320,00:50:40.080,Grace said there's a truce.
00:50:40.160,00:50:41.400,Family day.
00:50:43.800,00:50:47.200,- Your husband couldn't make it? - He's not speaking to me.
00:50:47.280,00:50:50.280,"And when he does, he calls me, A fucking Shelby."
00:50:50.360,00:50:52.120,Even though I'm a Thorne now.
00:50:52.200,00:50:54.240,Thorne in my side that's for sure.
00:50:54.880,00:51:01.080,"To have and hold-- My God, Tommy. You admire him, don't you?"
00:51:01.160,00:51:03.720,There remains one more part of the ceremony.
00:51:03.800,00:51:06.120,That's the mingling of the two bloods.
00:51:07.600,00:51:10.440,Where the two families become the one family.
00:51:13.320,00:51:15.240,I now pronounce you man and wife!
00:51:16.760,00:51:19.200,"Come on, John, kiss the bride, will you?"
00:52:19.360,00:52:22.760,- Tell Ada to slow down. - You think she'll listen to me?
00:52:22.840,00:52:25.440,I tried to stop her but she's been drinking.
00:52:25.520,00:52:28.120,She's been stuck in that basement for weeks.
00:52:28.200,00:52:31.440,What do you expect? She's going off like a firecracker.
00:52:31.520,00:52:33.040,"Oh, Christ, Tommy, please."
00:52:35.840,00:52:39.480,"Ada, come on, have a rest. Sit down."
00:52:39.560,00:52:43.080,Come and look Esme! Look at the family you've joined!
00:52:43.160,00:52:47.240,"Come, look at the man who runs it! He chooses his brother's wives!"
00:52:47.320,00:52:52.360,He hunts his own sister down like a rat and tries to kill his own brother-in-law.
00:52:52.440,00:52:53.640,"Ada, that's enough."
00:52:53.720,00:52:56.440,Now he won't even let me have a fucking dance!
00:52:56.520,00:52:59.560,- Not even at a fucking wedding! - Sit her down.
00:52:59.640,00:53:02.000,"Calm down, Ada. Ada, you must calm down."
00:53:03.600,00:53:06.960,Holy shit. Water. Right.
00:53:20.280,00:53:22.600,Come here. Enough now. Enough.
00:53:22.680,00:53:24.360,Slow her up. Nice and easy.
00:53:26.800,00:53:27.920,"Right, we are here."
00:53:30.560,00:53:31.800,Come on.
00:53:33.360,00:53:35.640,"Nice car, John. How's she run?"
00:53:35.720,00:53:37.200,Beautiful. Really smooth.
00:53:37.280,00:53:40.640,Your sister's giving birth and you're talking about a car.
00:53:40.720,00:53:42.560,Not much us men can do now.
00:53:42.640,00:53:45.040,"- Except go get drunk. - Right, come on."
00:53:45.120,00:53:47.200,There's one man who should be here.
00:53:50.480,00:53:53.400,"You are right, Pol, Freddie should be here."
00:53:54.400,00:53:57.000,Is that a heartbeat I hear inside that chest?
00:53:59.080,00:54:01.560,On my oath. Tell Freddie it's safe.
00:54:01.640,00:54:02.920,Ada!
00:54:03.000,00:54:05.720,"Right boys, let's wet the baby's head."
00:54:09.360,00:54:11.840,Keep going. That's right. Push.
00:54:17.480,00:54:19.840,I think it might be the wrong way round.
00:54:21.040,00:54:22.640,I attended three sisters.
00:54:24.120,00:54:25.320,You're right.
00:54:25.400,00:54:28.280,"- We should lean her forward. - Come on, Ada."
00:54:28.360,00:54:32.440,"Come on. Not long to go now, darling."
00:54:39.840,00:54:43.360,I should go. It's my wedding night.
00:54:43.440,00:54:44.920,You sit down.
00:54:45.000,00:54:48.600,You don't want to be among women when there's a baby coming.
00:54:48.680,00:54:51.360,You think her husband will stay away?
00:54:56.160,00:55:00.120,Tommy said it's all right for him to be there. Isn't that right?
00:55:00.200,00:55:03.160,That's right. I'm all heart tonight.
00:55:05.760,00:55:09.080,"You know what, John boy?"
00:55:10.560,00:55:18.640,"I think it's that lovely barmaid, that pretty one that just walked out that's made our brother go all soft."
00:55:35.840,00:55:36.920,Ada!
00:55:41.680,00:55:43.640,"Come on, open up."
00:55:47.360,00:55:48.920,"There you go, love."
00:55:52.560,00:55:54.440,"Aw, he's beautiful."
00:55:59.320,00:56:00.800,"It's a boy, Freddie."
00:56:07.720,00:56:09.960,It's a beautiful baby boy.
00:56:20.920,00:56:22.080,There you go.
00:56:23.720,00:56:25.360,"Welcome to the world, son."
00:56:27.720,00:56:28.840,Welcome.
00:56:28.920,00:56:30.920,Open up! Police!
00:56:32.720,00:56:34.240,Freddie...
00:56:34.320,00:56:38.000,You can't come in here. There's a baby just been born.
00:56:42.320,00:56:44.560,"You are hurting him, leave him alone."
00:56:44.640,00:56:47.280,You're taking me away from my baby.
00:56:47.360,00:56:50.000,- Ada! - Freddie!
00:57:05.320,00:57:07.920,You want me to open that champagne now?
00:57:10.080,00:57:11.200,It's a boy.
00:57:13.600,00:57:15.680,Pol? Polly? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:57:15.760,00:57:17.480,Polly! Polly!
00:57:18.080,00:57:20.800,But the police came and took his father away.
00:57:20.880,00:57:23.200,Don't you dare look at me like that.
00:57:32.360,00:57:33.840,You liar!
00:01:25.600,00:01:28.000,"Open up, love."
00:01:28.080,00:01:29.720,I brought more things for you and the baby.
00:01:29.800,00:01:33.320,Got some fresh eggs and bread. I'll leave it here.
00:01:35.480,00:01:37.680,"-Ada, think of the little one. -Shh."
00:01:39.360,00:01:41.320,Babies don't have principles.
00:02:10.280,00:02:11.720,Did you speak to her?
00:02:12.880,00:02:14.320,She didn't speak back.
00:02:17.680,00:02:19.120,"Well, did you tell her?"
00:02:20.720,00:02:23.240,I'll only tell her what I know to be true.
00:02:25.720,00:02:28.160,It's the last time I am going to say this.
00:02:33.560,00:02:34.960,Tommy.
00:02:35.040,00:02:40.280,"I'd ask you to swear on the Bible, but you can't swear on that, can you?"
00:02:40.360,00:02:41.680,Nothing you hold sacred.
00:02:52.160,00:02:53.320,There's tea.
00:02:59.200,00:03:00.560,The new system.
00:03:01.680,00:03:03.520,"Everything in the diary, eh?"
00:03:03.600,00:03:04.680,Mm-hmm.
00:03:09.880,00:03:12.280,Black star. What does that mean?
00:03:12.840,00:03:18.280,The black star day is the day we take out Billy Kimber and his men.
00:03:18.840,00:03:20.240,No one knows this.
00:03:21.360,00:03:22.720,Not even your family?
00:03:24.440,00:03:25.800,Grace.
00:03:28.480,00:03:31.400,Everyone in my family hates me.
00:03:31.480,00:03:32.640,Why would I tell them?
00:03:35.880,00:03:38.240,He's off the bloody rails is what he is.
00:03:38.320,00:03:40.400,If he'll turn nose on his best mate...
00:03:40.480,00:03:43.560,"Bloody neighbors, John. Snitch behind the curtain."
00:03:43.640,00:03:47.360,"Yeah, well, if you think that, you're the only one who does."
00:03:47.440,00:03:49.120,"Look at this, look."
00:03:49.200,00:03:52.240,Bloody raking it in. Who's running this carny?
00:03:52.320,00:03:53.880,Name of Marston.
00:03:53.960,00:03:55.800,Intends on wintering in Small Heath with this ring.
00:03:55.880,00:03:58.040,-Does he? -Only heard.
00:03:58.120,00:04:02.880,Nobody in Small Heath craps in a pot without the decree of Tommy Almighty.
00:04:02.960,00:04:06.560,"Mr. Marston, I believe. The ringmaster!"
00:04:06.640,00:04:10.800,"-Proud I am to say so. -Yes, well, these here are civilized parts."
00:04:10.880,00:04:16.040,"Man wants to set his stall up with fellas lamping each other, he needs himself a license."
00:04:16.120,00:04:17.200,A license?
00:04:18.440,00:04:21.519,For a fee. From those in charge.
00:04:23.760,00:04:28.560,"I'll tell you what. How about I keep my money, and you shove a license up your arse crack?"
00:04:28.640,00:04:30.280,You don't want to speak to me like that.
00:04:30.360,00:04:32.040,And who the bloody hell do you think you are?
00:04:32.120,00:04:35.040,My name is Arthur Shelby!
00:04:37.080,00:04:38.400,Dad?
00:04:44.600,00:04:45.680,Jesus!
00:04:51.280,00:04:52.960,Thank you. You are a good boy.
00:04:56.080,00:05:00.320,"Bless thee, Father, for these bounties we are about to receive-- Jesus Christ."
00:05:00.400,00:05:03.200,"Please, woman, not in vain."
00:05:04.560,00:05:06.400,Finish your sandwich and sling your hook.
00:05:21.480,00:05:22.680,Tommy.
00:05:22.760,00:05:26.080,"He sometimes helps me with... with business, Dad."
00:05:29.400,00:05:31.440,"Aye, well, speak of the devil."
00:05:33.400,00:05:34.680,"How are you, son?"
00:05:36.600,00:05:37.880,Get out.
00:05:38.720,00:05:39.680,"Come on, son."
00:05:40.760,00:05:42.040,I'm a changed man.
00:05:43.200,00:05:48.520,"This family needed you ten years ago, and you walked out on us."
00:05:48.600,00:05:50.920,Not now. Get out of this house.
00:05:51.280,00:05:53.440,"-Tommy, he's different-- -Shut up."
00:05:56.640,00:05:58.000,"It's all right, son."
00:06:09.640,00:06:11.520,Quite something you've become.
00:06:17.360,00:06:18.520,"Bye, son."
00:06:33.600,00:06:35.080,He's a selfish bastard.
00:06:37.520,00:06:43.440,"You calling someone a selfish bastard, that's a bit rich, Tommy."
00:06:43.520,00:06:48.000,"I mean, thanks to you, we're already down a bloody sister."
00:06:49.400,00:06:52.200,"You want to see him, Arthur? You want to see him?"
00:06:53.520,00:06:54.840,You go with him.
00:07:24.200,00:07:28.960,"Grace, I am taking five pounds from petty cash, all right?"
00:07:30.920,00:07:32.640,Then I'll take what we've got.
00:07:32.720,00:07:34.040,Count it and leave a receipt.
00:07:36.480,00:07:39.880,"Arthur, there are things in these books I don't understand."
00:07:39.960,00:07:47.600,-Likewise. -Every week we pay one pound ten shilling by postal order to a Daniel Owen in London.
00:07:47.680,00:07:52.360,"Danny Whizz-Bang, hangs around the pubs in Camden Town Wharf for us."
00:07:52.440,00:07:55.080,Keeps his ears open for business. He's a good man.
00:07:55.160,00:07:56.560,I thought Danny Whizz-Bang was dead.
00:07:56.640,00:07:58.640,"Then you thought wrong, didn't you?"
00:08:01.560,00:08:04.320,That was a show to satisfy the wops.
00:08:04.400,00:08:06.680,Tommy just shot some sheep's brains at him.
00:08:08.080,00:08:09.600,Who's buried in his grave?
00:08:14.360,00:08:22.160,"Now, look, Grace, if you know what's good for you, you don't ask questions about things that don't concern you."
00:08:22.240,00:08:23.680,Never. Right?
00:08:25.200,00:08:28.080,That's for you. And don't tell Tommy I took this!
00:08:58.400,00:09:00.400,"The boy needs a good hiding, if you ask me."
00:09:00.480,00:09:03.440,"Yeah, well, Aunt Polly's close to giving him one."
00:09:03.520,00:09:05.480,"John and Ada, too, it sounds like."
00:09:05.560,00:09:07.880,John moans on bloody principle.
00:09:07.960,00:09:09.680,But if you saw his missus...
00:09:12.840,00:09:14.640,"You have a girl yourself, son?"
00:09:17.960,00:09:19.840,"Perhaps when it suits Tommy, eh?"
00:09:22.000,00:09:26.920,"Yeah, well, he's been different, you know, since the war."
00:09:27.000,00:09:31.040,"Yeah, well, a war can change a man."
00:09:31.120,00:09:32.880,"Speaking for myself, anyway."
00:09:32.960,00:09:34.480,"Where did you fight, Dad?"
00:09:35.000,00:09:37.840,"Ah, all over, son, all over."
00:09:39.920,00:09:49.800,"Then the salvation of Jesus Christ spread His light over me, and as a pilgrim, I come to visit the New World."
00:09:50.320,00:09:51.760,America.
00:09:51.840,00:09:54.200,Where I beheld the future.
00:09:56.720,00:10:00.120,"Casinos. Money factories, son."
00:10:00.200,00:10:08.840,"Look, I've been studying the competition, their schemes, their systems. Look at that."
00:10:08.920,00:10:10.960,-Show me. -It's all there.
00:10:11.040,00:10:13.080,There's a fortune to be made here.
00:10:15.080,00:10:18.200,"I'm an old man, and my heart's a battered vessel."
00:10:18.280,00:10:19.320,But within...
00:10:21.280,00:10:24.240,there still beats the fluttering pulse of a dream.
00:10:26.200,00:10:30.640,The Shelby Casino and Hotel.
00:10:30.720,00:10:34.440,Gents and dames will come flocking from all corners.
00:10:35.000,00:10:44.120,"New York, Chicago, Boston. To the Shelby, where I can stand proudly with my dear children by my side."
00:10:45.200,00:10:46.680,And the women there!
00:10:48.720,00:10:52.280,Like fresh peaches. Thou could have a dozen.
00:10:55.480,00:10:57.800,We'd all of us be kings!
00:10:57.880,00:10:59.880,How much? How much to get started?
00:11:05.360,00:11:06.680,Let's do it.
00:11:07.600,00:11:09.720,Let's do it. Let's bloody do it.
00:11:09.800,00:11:14.760,"It would make my heart beam, but I don't want to cause any discord between the brothers."
00:11:14.840,00:11:17.720,"So, please, why don't you talk to Tommy first."
00:11:17.800,00:11:20.640,"No, no, I'm sick of taking orders from him."
00:11:20.720,00:11:23.920,Tommy's not the only one in the family with a head for business.
00:11:25.800,00:11:30.280,And Shelby money is Shelby money.
00:11:30.360,00:11:33.840,I thank God for my wonderful sons.
00:11:35.720,00:11:37.960,This is cause for a celebration!
00:11:38.040,00:11:39.600,-Yeah. -Sláinte!
00:11:39.680,00:11:40.800,Sláinte!
00:11:47.200,00:11:48.600,"On your feet, soldier."
00:11:50.480,00:11:51.640,On your feet!
00:11:59.280,00:12:00.640,"I don't want to fight you, Dad."
00:12:00.720,00:12:03.520,"Come on, boy! I'm old enough to be your father."
00:12:13.680,00:12:15.480,On your feet.
00:12:15.840,00:12:16.880,Get up!
00:12:18.080,00:12:19.120,All right!
00:12:30.680,00:12:32.280,"Is that all you've got, boy?"
00:12:39.280,00:12:40.360,Get up!
00:12:51.720,00:12:55.520,This here is Arthur Shelby Jr.!
00:12:55.600,00:12:59.720,"My son! I love him, and I'm proud of him."
00:12:59.800,00:13:02.720,And he can fight any one of youse in here!
00:13:10.800,00:13:13.920,"You did good, son. You did good."
00:13:14.000,00:13:16.720,"I love you, Dad! I love you!"
00:13:35.720,00:13:37.080,Mr. Shelby?
00:13:38.560,00:13:39.880,Who's asking?
00:13:40.680,00:13:41.760,My name is Byrne.
00:13:43.560,00:13:46.720,I had word from your man in Camden Town you wanted to parley.
00:13:48.200,00:13:49.600,Then parley it is.
00:13:52.000,00:13:57.480,"A few months ago, a man named Ryan came to this place with a view to buying some goods from you."
00:13:57.560,00:13:59.800,Mr. Ryan met with an accident. He was shot.
00:14:00.280,00:14:01.840,I heard.
00:14:05.040,00:14:07.040,I wondered if he made any enemies in here.
00:14:07.120,00:14:08.960,None that I know of.
00:14:09.040,00:14:11.200,It's not the kind of place to make enemies.
00:14:11.280,00:14:12.720,"All are welcome here, Mr. Byrne."
00:14:12.800,00:14:14.200,Including Irish?
00:14:14.280,00:14:15.760,"Oh, especially Irish."
00:14:17.960,00:14:21.120,Ryan told you he was a member of the Irish Republican Army.
00:14:21.200,00:14:23.240,Was he still welcome?
00:14:23.320,00:14:25.800,"Like I say, any man that buys beer is welcome."
00:14:25.880,00:14:27.680,Perhaps you didn't believe him.
00:14:38.080,00:14:39.920,It's hard to tell which is which.
00:14:41.680,00:14:44.520,"As a teetotal man, I find that amusing."
00:14:44.600,00:14:47.200,Except when it ends in tragedy.
00:14:47.280,00:14:49.320,"Would you like some water and cordial, Mr. Byrne?"
00:14:49.400,00:14:56.800,"You see, Mr. Shelby, Ryan, for all his quick mouth, was indeed connected."
00:14:56.880,00:14:59.800,Very well connected to our brotherhood.
00:14:59.880,00:15:03.040,By membership and blood. He was my cousin.
00:15:04.960,00:15:06.560,I am from South Armagh.
00:15:08.560,00:15:11.400,I'm a man of influence there.
00:15:11.480,00:15:13.760,"Cordial and water would be grand, Mr. Shelby."
00:15:17.200,00:15:19.800,"Grace, bring some water and cordial to the snug."
00:15:19.880,00:15:21.560,"-This way. -Yes, Mr. Shelby."
00:15:34.280,00:15:35.920,My cousin came to buy guns.
00:15:36.000,00:15:37.520,And I told him I have none.
00:15:39.400,00:15:41.920,"Your man, Danny Owen, talks a lot when he's drunk."
00:15:44.000,00:15:46.160,He says the Peaky Blinders do have the guns.
00:15:46.400,00:15:48.480,Robbed from the factory down the road.
00:15:48.560,00:15:54.200,He boasts about a stack of Lewis machine guns and enough belts of ammunition to hold up God's trousers.
00:15:54.280,00:15:59.520,Yep. That sounds like our Danny. He has an imagination.
00:15:59.600,00:16:03.480,"Like I say, sometimes it's the whiskey that does the talking."
00:16:13.680,00:16:16.160,He says only the brothers know where the guns are kept.
00:16:16.240,00:16:22.240,"Well, Danny also says he sees German infantrymen on the back of mill carts."
00:16:22.320,00:16:24.280,And he shoots them with his broomstick.
00:16:26.520,00:16:29.080,We have men in the BSA factory.
00:16:30.080,00:16:32.320,They say it's you who has them.
00:16:32.400,00:16:35.440,And we have men who work in the police station.
00:16:35.520,00:16:37.640,"Every finger, Mr. Shelby."
00:16:38.360,00:16:42.280,Every finger in this city points in one direction.
00:16:44.080,00:16:45.800,Please don't mistake me for a fool.
00:17:02.080,00:17:03.800,Let me get to the point.
00:17:04.160,00:17:14.960,"I don't care what kind of half-arsed tinker operation you have going here. But I can assure you, I represent a very different category of organization."
00:17:17.960,00:17:19.440,My cousin was shot.
00:17:21.480,00:17:24.960,"I am judge, jury and executioner."
00:17:25.040,00:17:27.400,"I find you guilty, and I pass sentence."
00:17:28.480,00:17:36.600,"You deliver the guns to me, or I deliver death and hell's fury to you and your little tribe of heathens."
00:17:37.480,00:17:39.240,Am I making myself clear?
00:17:52.720,00:17:54.640,Let me confess something to you.
00:17:55.320,00:17:56.880,And only to you.
00:17:58.960,00:18:03.200,"I have the guns, but they have become a burden to me."
00:18:06.080,00:18:09.000,Perhaps it is time to unload that burden.
00:18:10.680,00:18:12.240,For the right price.
00:18:40.000,00:18:43.240,Brigade commander of the South Armagh IRA.
00:18:45.000,00:18:46.480,You hooked yourself a big fish there.
00:18:46.560,00:18:49.560,"With these guns as bait, who knows what we'll catch?"
00:18:49.640,00:18:51.560,We.
00:18:51.640,00:18:55.720,Are you suggesting that you and I could work together as a team?
00:18:59.880,00:19:01.360,Can you deliver him?
00:19:01.440,00:19:03.200,With your help.
00:19:03.280,00:19:06.440,And I want word put out in Ireland that I was not involved.
00:19:14.360,00:19:18.880,"If I get a medal, I will have your initials engraved on the backside."
00:19:27.440,00:19:32.800,"Inspector, since we're getting on so well, can you answer me a question?"
00:19:32.880,00:19:34.480,Who gave you Freddie Thorne?
00:19:35.640,00:19:41.400,"As everyone in the city knows, it was you, Mr. Shelby."
00:20:09.880,00:20:10.960,"Hello, son."
00:20:12.760,00:20:13.960,It's all there.
00:20:16.320,00:20:18.560,It is indeed.
00:20:18.640,00:20:20.960,"We're gonna build something with this, son."
00:20:21.040,00:20:22.680,Something magnificent.
00:20:22.760,00:20:24.240,"When do we sail, Dad?"
00:20:24.320,00:20:26.240,"-Hungry for work, are you? -Yeah."
00:20:26.320,00:20:28.720,A ship sails Friday. Meet me at the boxing ring.
00:20:28.800,00:20:30.760,Good. Friday.
00:20:30.840,00:20:32.280,Friday.
00:21:05.880,00:21:07.320,Leave that open.
00:21:18.800,00:21:19.880,No.
00:21:19.960,00:21:21.960,-Are you expecting trouble? -Yeah.
00:21:22.040,00:21:24.720,-At this hour? -Midnight is as good an hour as any.
00:21:25.880,00:21:31.400,"When the St. Andrew's bell strikes midnight, two IRA men are gonna come through that door."
00:21:31.480,00:21:34.600,"When they have what they want, they plan to kill me."
00:21:34.680,00:21:36.760,It's your job to stop that happening.
00:21:36.840,00:21:38.400,You could've given me some more warning.
00:21:38.480,00:21:40.480,I just got the message myself.
00:21:40.560,00:21:42.920,-They want to meet here alone. -And barmaids don't count?
00:21:43.000,00:21:47.160,"No. Barmaids don't count. Now, you're gonna be in that back room."
00:21:47.240,00:21:51.360,"I'm gonna be sitting there. When I make a toast, you're gonna come out with that thing raised."
00:21:51.440,00:21:54.000,You don't shoot. You just point. I'll do the rest.
00:21:55.680,00:21:57.960,"-Will you kill them? -No, the police want them alive."
00:21:58.040,00:22:00.960,"-The police know about this? -Look, just hold it up."
00:22:05.040,00:22:06.760,"All right, go. Go on. Go!"
00:22:33.160,00:22:35.120,We'll hold back here.
00:22:35.200,00:22:38.960,"If damage is done to either side, it's no concern of ours."
00:23:12.560,00:23:13.800,"Lost your thirst, eh?"
00:23:14.600,00:23:16.320,Just show us where.
00:23:22.040,00:23:23.560,Give me the cash.
00:23:33.720,00:23:35.680,You're gonna need a shovel.
00:23:48.240,00:23:52.200,You thick fucking tinker. Did you think we'd let you live?
00:23:53.880,00:23:56.080,"Make your peace, Mr. Shelby."
00:23:59.960,00:24:01.880,I will make my peace my own way.
00:24:07.800,00:24:09.440,To barmaids who don't count.
00:26:04.560,00:26:05.920,Why did you shoot?
00:26:07.040,00:26:09.360,"Why did you shoot, Grace?"
00:26:09.440,00:26:11.600,I didn't know I had it in me like that.
00:26:14.480,00:26:16.000,Now you've seen me.
00:26:19.960,00:26:21.240,And you've seen me.
00:26:24.160,00:26:25.240,I'm sorry.
00:26:43.480,00:26:45.800,You were supposed to come on the sixth chime.
00:26:45.880,00:26:48.600,You were supposed to come on the fucking sixth chime!
00:26:55.160,00:26:56.720,They refused to surrender.
00:26:59.160,00:27:01.280,They fought well. They were brave men.
00:27:03.200,00:27:06.600,"Well, he looks like he was killed by a wild fucking animal."
00:27:08.080,00:27:14.720,"Still, this never happened. They were never here. Who cares?"
00:27:14.800,00:27:16.720,Get the bodies out of here.
00:27:16.800,00:27:19.960,"Ah, right, are they making the lady uncomfortable?"
00:27:21.600,00:27:23.800,"I'll leave you two lovebirds to it, then, eh?"
00:28:12.640,00:28:13.640,Thank you.
00:28:18.040,00:28:19.120,I'm sorry.
00:28:57.680,00:29:03.400,"First of all, let me say, I had no idea he would involve you in this ugly business."
00:29:03.480,00:29:06.560,"If I had, I never would have let it happen."
00:29:06.640,00:29:09.880,He trusts me. I told you that. You didn't believe me.
00:29:10.480,00:29:11.800,Fine.
00:29:13.120,00:29:16.680,"Sergeant Moss made a report, which, of course, I burnt."
00:29:16.760,00:29:20.160,"He said, when he entered the room, you were embracing."
00:29:21.880,00:29:24.760,Is that your primary concern? An embrace?
00:29:28.920,00:29:30.120,It was me who killed them.
00:29:32.640,00:29:34.960,I had no control.
00:29:35.040,00:29:37.080,You have been living with beasts.
00:29:38.880,00:29:40.800,It was the beast that tried to stop me.
00:29:48.320,00:29:51.400,I believe last night something inside me changed.
00:29:52.160,00:29:54.760,I no longer feel the need to avenge my father.
00:29:55.680,00:29:58.240,The hatred that I brought here with me is gone.
00:30:00.080,00:30:02.560,"And therefore, my reasons for joining the service."
00:30:03.000,00:30:04.440,You want to resign?
00:30:06.160,00:30:08.360,I think our mission has come to a natural end.
00:30:11.000,00:30:13.640,I think I know where the guns are hidden.
00:30:13.720,00:30:15.720,You do? So tell me where.
00:30:15.800,00:30:20.920,"If I'm right and the guns are found, you have no more business with Thomas Shelby. Is that not so?"
00:30:21.000,00:30:24.720,"Our military mission will be over, and we can leave the city as we found it."
00:30:26.280,00:30:28.040,Are you trying to do a deal with me?
00:30:28.120,00:30:32.320,"Because if you are, you must be explicit."
00:30:32.400,00:30:39.240,I want your word that Thomas Shelby will not be harmed if the guns are recovered. Your word as a gentleman.
00:30:40.360,00:30:41.560,Will you give it?
00:30:41.640,00:30:43.600,"Now, why would you want to save him?"
00:30:45.840,00:30:47.920,A residue of sympathy.
00:30:48.000,00:30:50.040,Sympathy? You mean sentiment?
00:30:51.360,00:30:53.080,Yes.
00:30:53.160,00:30:56.000,"In his way, he has been kind to me."
00:30:56.080,00:30:58.800,-Sentiment. -Yes.
00:31:05.240,00:31:07.320,You're too good-hearted for this work.
00:31:09.080,00:31:10.480,Perhaps.
00:31:11.720,00:31:13.480,"So, for my sake, will you spare him?"
00:31:16.160,00:31:17.560,You have my word.
00:31:21.480,00:31:26.080,"A week after the robbery, there was a burial at St. Andrew's churchyard."
00:31:26.160,00:31:30.280,I have found out that the man supposed to be buried is alive.
00:31:30.360,00:31:32.760,Arthur is quite transparent.
00:31:32.840,00:31:37.200,I learned that the funeral was attended only by the brothers.
00:31:37.280,00:31:42.880,And the grave that they dug was far deeper than your average and lined with lead.
00:31:42.960,00:31:44.680,To keep out the damp.
00:31:47.600,00:31:49.840,The guns are buried in that grave.
00:31:51.920,00:31:54.240,Then tonight we will dig up that grave.
00:32:56.640,00:32:57.880,"Well done, boys."
00:33:16.640,00:33:18.360,All but one gun accounted for.
00:33:29.120,00:33:31.440,"Then, sir, I resign my commission."
00:33:34.040,00:33:35.400,Good.
00:33:36.280,00:33:37.640,Good.
00:33:39.440,00:33:46.920,"So I am no longer your superior officer, and you are no longer my subordinate."
00:33:48.400,00:33:56.680,"And therefore, regulations permit me to offer you this."
00:34:04.400,00:34:08.360,I'm a... I'm a simple man but a good man.
00:34:09.840,00:34:14.480,And my admiration for you has turned to love.
00:34:16.719,00:34:20.480,I don't ask for love in return. Just...
00:34:20.560,00:34:26.239,recognition that we are like minds with shared values.
00:34:27.960,00:34:32.080,"Grace, will you marry me?"
00:34:45.199,00:34:46.360,Mr. Campbell...
00:34:51.080,00:34:52.480,you deserve better.
00:35:04.120,00:35:05.280,Is it him between us?
00:35:06.680,00:35:09.360,Is it the beast that dug that grave?
00:35:09.440,00:35:11.240,Is it him?!
00:35:12.680,00:35:15.000,My resignation will be with you in the morning.
00:35:34.960,00:35:36.240,Dad?
00:35:40.160,00:35:41.560,"Hello, son."
00:35:42.360,00:35:44.120,May I ask who gave you my whereabouts?
00:35:44.200,00:35:46.080,Marston.
00:35:46.160,00:35:48.720,Said you left him last night with a bill for your whores.
00:35:48.800,00:35:51.120,"Well, at least we got to say goodbye, son."
00:35:52.680,00:35:55.600,"And bid a fond adieu to your dear brothers, would you?"
00:35:57.000,00:35:58.640,How could you do this to us?
00:35:58.720,00:35:59.760,"Do what, son?"
00:35:59.840,00:36:04.320,All that stuff you said about the Shelby Casino.
00:36:05.960,00:36:08.280,And Atlantic City.
00:36:17.800,00:36:21.920,You're a fucking liar and a thief.
00:36:22.000,00:36:24.320,You give me back my fucking money!
00:36:25.360,00:36:30.840,Do not despise the thief who steals to satisfy his starvation.
00:36:32.360,00:36:34.120,"That's in the Holy Bible, son."
00:36:35.360,00:36:38.320,And I have starved for so very long.
00:36:40.840,00:36:42.920,"Fare thee well, son."
00:36:46.920,00:36:48.400,I waited for you.
00:36:50.680,00:36:52.280,I waited.
00:36:55.680,00:36:58.120,"Listen to me, boy."
00:36:58.200,00:37:00.440,You are not in the prize ring now.
00:37:00.520,00:37:06.680,"If you ever put your hands on me again, I'll cut your fucking throat and spread you on these tracks."
00:37:47.040,00:37:48.360,Where's your father?
00:37:54.000,00:37:59.880,"I'm assuming he's frittering away the 500 you took from us and put in his thieving, whore-groping hands."
00:38:02.600,00:38:04.080,What were you thinking?
00:38:12.520,00:38:13.920,Does Tommy know?
00:38:23.000,00:38:24.680,No.
00:38:24.760,00:38:26.120,But you're gonna tell him.
00:38:27.560,00:38:32.800,You might take satisfaction in a great victory.
00:38:32.880,00:38:35.600,A terrible consequence has been avoided.
00:38:37.240,00:38:45.080,Those guns that we dug up will never be used to murder the innocent or usurp the status quo.
00:38:45.160,00:38:51.640,"But even though we have solved a crime, we have as yet failed to punish the criminal."
00:38:51.720,00:38:57.040,This man who dug this grave has also dug his own.
00:38:57.120,00:39:01.840,He has proved a deadly menace to the King's peace.
00:39:01.920,00:39:03.960,And tonight we will strike him down.
00:39:04.040,00:39:07.840,We will drive our sword through his black heart.
00:39:07.920,00:39:12.280,We will pursue him into the ratholes that he infests.
00:39:12.360,00:39:17.640,"And finally, we will rid this city of his kind."
00:39:17.720,00:39:21.720,Justice will be done and will be seen to be done.
00:39:24.000,00:39:25.120,Amen.
00:39:27.960,00:39:30.160,"There's gonna be trouble now, Finn."
00:39:30.240,00:39:32.360,"You look after yourself, do you hear me?"
00:39:32.440,00:39:35.000,I'm gonna be going away for a while.
00:39:35.080,00:39:36.440,Right. Go on.
00:39:44.280,00:39:48.440,Right! Who wants to fucking fight?
00:39:48.520,00:39:52.080,Fighting's over. We're closing up and moving on.
00:39:52.160,00:39:54.680,"I said, who wants to fucking fight?"
00:39:54.760,00:39:58.880,My name is Arthur fucking Shelby!
00:40:03.800,00:40:05.880,Who dare fight me?
00:40:05.960,00:40:08.680,"Go home, lad, before you catch yourself a spanking."
00:40:20.720,00:40:26.880,"My brother in Digbeth just said the police are coming down from Deritend in numbers, asking for Tommy Shelby by name."
00:40:29.440,00:40:31.000,Shit.
00:40:40.520,00:40:42.080,I'm gonna have to lie low for a while.
00:40:42.160,00:40:44.160,-Why? -I lost my bargaining power.
00:40:47.240,00:40:51.320,"When I get back, I'm gonna tell you some things."
00:40:51.400,00:40:53.400,Harry said the police are already in Digbeth.
00:40:53.480,00:40:54.640,Yeah.
00:40:54.720,00:40:57.400,You took a chance coming here. Why?
00:40:57.480,00:40:59.240,"The police are in the lane, Tommy!"
00:41:00.400,00:41:02.000,Come with me.
00:42:15.680,00:42:18.440,I'm looking for Thomas Shelby.
00:42:26.800,00:42:27.920,Never heard of him.
00:42:33.800,00:42:35.200,You'll never find him.
00:42:43.600,00:42:44.880,Go home.
00:42:52.400,00:42:54.680,Perhaps I should ask that question again.
00:42:55.960,00:42:57.040,On your knees.
00:43:03.720,00:43:07.320,"Now, understand this, barman."
00:43:07.400,00:43:09.320,I don't care if you live or die.
00:43:10.000,00:43:11.640,I don't know!
00:43:22.000,00:43:23.480,He left.
00:43:24.320,00:43:25.400,With the barmaid.
00:43:27.320,00:43:28.880,He left with Grace.
00:43:30.680,00:43:32.440,I think they were going to her place.
00:43:40.840,00:43:42.840,Call it off.
00:43:42.920,00:43:46.440,"I don't understand, sir. We should find the barmaid and-- Call it off!"
00:43:48.040,00:43:49.080,All of it!
00:43:51.720,00:43:53.000,Get in!
00:44:09.040,00:44:10.720,It's not much of a place.
00:44:11.920,00:44:13.400,It's all right.
00:44:13.480,00:44:14.480,You want tea?
00:44:14.560,00:44:16.440,Tea? No.
00:44:16.520,00:44:18.160,I have rum.
00:44:18.240,00:44:20.000,"Actually, tea it is."
00:44:20.080,00:44:21.200,You want to impress me?
00:44:21.280,00:44:24.080,Yes. And do you have a biscuit?
00:44:24.560,00:44:25.960,No. They attract mice.
00:44:28.200,00:44:30.040,People look different at home.
00:44:30.120,00:44:31.560,In what way?
00:44:31.640,00:44:32.920,Off guard.
00:44:36.840,00:44:38.440,Should I be on my guard?
00:44:38.520,00:44:40.960,"No, I'm a man who drinks tea."
00:44:55.000,00:44:56.960,"When the trouble dies down, I'll go."
00:45:04.600,00:45:07.280,"When will it die down, do you think?"
00:45:07.360,00:45:09.200,"Late, I'd say."
00:45:12.520,00:45:14.680,"So not until the morning, then."
00:45:16.760,00:45:18.800,Yes. I'd say I'll be here till morning.
00:45:26.400,00:45:28.520,-You have a gramophone. -It's broken.
00:45:28.600,00:45:30.080,We could still dance.
00:45:42.320,00:45:44.360,I know you like to be asked properly.
00:45:47.000,00:45:48.840,"Grace, can I have this dance?"
00:48:13.800,00:48:15.080,Will you help me?
00:48:18.680,00:48:19.920,With everything.
00:48:21.360,00:48:23.680,The whole fucking thing.
00:48:23.760,00:48:26.760,"Fucking life, business."
00:48:29.680,00:48:31.040,I found you.
00:48:33.080,00:48:34.360,And you found me.
00:48:37.560,00:48:38.960,We'll help each other.
00:49:53.960,00:49:57.400,"Our Father, who art in Heaven."
00:49:59.120,00:50:00.760,Hallowed be Thy name.
00:50:01.880,00:50:03.680,Thy...
00:50:58.600,00:51:00.880,Send a telegram to Mr. Churchill.
00:51:02.200,00:51:04.160,"I have news, very good news."
00:51:06.200,00:51:09.600,Tell him the business I came to attend to is now complete.
00:51:10.920,00:51:13.400,I'll be leaving the city.
00:51:13.480,00:51:17.600,There's just one matter I need to tidy up first.
00:51:57.960,00:51:59.600,So Polly told you.
00:52:01.280,00:52:02.280,Yep.
00:52:15.520,00:52:17.120,You should have used a gun.
00:52:19.800,00:52:21.320,"Are you laughing at me, Tommy?"
00:52:22.120,00:52:23.160,Yeah.
00:52:25.280,00:52:30.240,"Just when things are starting to go right, Arthur, you try and do this."
00:52:33.200,00:52:35.600,Don't you like fancy parties?
00:52:35.680,00:52:37.480,"Or, um..."
00:52:37.560,00:52:39.720,Champagne? Or fast cars?
00:52:42.200,00:52:43.520,And how about this?
00:52:48.760,00:52:51.040,Your name on a business card.
00:52:51.120,00:52:55.320,"Shelby Brothers, Limited?"
00:52:55.400,00:52:59.880,Arthur Shelby. Associate bookmaker.
00:53:02.960,00:53:05.280,You're one of three shareholders.
00:53:06.600,00:53:08.240,"Me, you, John."
00:53:08.320,00:53:11.440,"And according to the law, we are equal partners."
00:53:11.520,00:53:14.720,And it is written in the paperwork in black and white.
00:53:14.800,00:53:17.560,"A third, a third, a third."
00:53:21.200,00:53:22.560,But the thing is...
00:53:22.640,00:53:26.000,"Well, me and John, we quite fancy splitting your share so..."
00:53:26.080,00:53:28.720,"just next time, use a gun, man."
00:53:33.800,00:53:36.640,Our men at the station tell me that copper is leaving town.
00:53:38.080,00:53:39.160,We're in the clear.
00:53:42.680,00:53:44.640,"We're on our way up in the world, brother."
00:53:47.680,00:53:48.760,Believe me.
00:01:13.440,00:01:14.840,Service.
00:01:17.920,00:01:21.120,We do not open for two more hours. You come back later.
00:01:22.080,00:01:23.120,Police.
00:01:29.000,00:01:31.000,"Inspector Campbell, Sir."
00:01:34.480,00:01:35.720,Look.
00:01:36.400,00:01:37.600,I know.
00:01:38.960,00:01:40.360,I know.
00:01:42.480,00:01:46.080,"That is, I am given to understand by several of my officers..."
00:01:48.160,00:01:51.960,...several of my officers that people come here.
00:01:54.000,00:01:58.560,That men come here for a certain purpose.
00:02:13.080,00:02:14.120,Arthur?
00:02:16.640,00:02:20.760,"Get home, get bathed, check your kit, check your weapons."
00:02:23.440,00:02:24.560,Why?
00:02:26.800,00:02:28.320,What's going on?
00:02:30.160,00:02:31.600,We're doing it today.
00:02:44.680,00:02:46.360,"Fetch the wagons, Charlie."
00:02:46.760,00:02:47.960,It's today.
00:03:14.080,00:03:15.960,"I'll be there in a minute, mate."
00:03:18.880,00:03:21.560,John? I told you to keep the doors locked.
00:03:21.640,00:03:24.400,I could've been anyone. Now get dressed.
00:03:24.680,00:03:25.920,We're doing it today.
00:03:26.000,00:03:28.360,"As a matter of fact, he's doing me today."
00:03:28.440,00:03:30.320,Make sure he's done you by nine.
00:03:30.400,00:03:33.840,- You should learn to knock! - It's not a day for knocking.
00:03:35.080,00:03:37.920,"Dear Lord, make this day pass well."
00:03:39.120,00:03:43.520,"Let none get hurt and make them that do, not Shelby's."
00:03:45.080,00:03:49.480,Watch John because he has so many depending on him.
00:03:50.640,00:03:56.400,Watch Arthur because he's likely to hurt himself as much as anyone else.
00:03:57.360,00:03:59.000,And watch Thomas.
00:04:02.920,00:04:05.120,But he does what he does for us.
00:04:07.400,00:04:08.600,I think.
00:04:09.680,00:04:10.960,Amen.
00:04:17.480,00:04:20.200,I used to do that every morning during the war.
00:04:20.280,00:04:22.520,I hoped I'd done it for the last time.
00:04:22.600,00:04:24.600,"Today will be the last time, Pol."
00:04:26.440,00:04:29.560,After today there'll be no need for prayers.
00:04:29.640,00:04:31.040,We'll be set.
00:04:33.480,00:04:35.520,"Family meeting, half ten."
00:04:49.320,00:04:51.200,I'm sorry I kept you.
00:04:51.280,00:04:52.800,It is so early.
00:04:53.440,00:04:57.600,Yes. I- I-- I didn't sleep last night.
00:05:00.360,00:05:03.920,"Mr Zhang said you are special, special customer."
00:05:15.840,00:05:17.280,Do you want to sit?
00:05:25.880,00:05:28.000,Do you want to take off your boots?
00:05:29.560,00:05:30.920,Yes.
00:05:39.800,00:05:41.800,And this.
00:05:47.520,00:05:49.000,So tight.
00:06:01.920,00:06:05.080,We can clean and press your shirt while we do this.
00:06:05.840,00:06:07.920,That's a very efficient service.
00:06:10.240,00:06:12.920,You never been to a place like this before?
00:06:15.120,00:06:16.600,It's okay.
00:06:16.680,00:06:20.120,Sometimes old men who have lost their wives they come here.
00:06:20.200,00:06:21.720,Most of the time.
00:06:22.280,00:06:24.920,Old men? I am so old?
00:06:26.240,00:06:28.520,I mean I am young.
00:06:28.720,00:06:29.880,Anyway...
00:06:31.760,00:06:33.640,I'll make you young as well.
00:07:34.200,00:07:35.520,Whore.
00:07:51.240,00:07:54.080,I write this letter to you with a heavy heart.
00:07:54.760,00:07:58.920,I know exactly what you did and with whom.
00:07:59.800,00:08:02.760,I will not mention any of it in my report.
00:08:02.880,00:08:10.440,"However, you should be aware that I know you gave yourself to the man who is our sworn enemy."
00:08:10.880,00:08:16.920,"That is not only treason, it is disgusting beyond all measure."
00:08:17.000,00:08:19.320,Your father would be ashamed of you.
00:08:20.080,00:08:23.400,"And as for myself, I am beyond desolation."
00:08:23.840,00:08:29.960,You have betrayed every principle and standard of honor that was your birthright.
00:08:30.960,00:08:32.240,And for what?
00:08:34.400,00:08:35.800,Love.
00:08:57.920,00:09:00.200,Oh my God. I'm sorry. Did I do that?
00:09:00.400,00:09:01.560,It's okay.
00:09:02.080,00:09:04.400,"You are special, special customer."
00:09:05.240,00:09:07.280,Would you sit with me for a moment?
00:09:07.720,00:09:09.000,Please.
00:09:43.080,00:09:44.440,For the suits.
00:09:45.080,00:09:47.120,You want to hear something funny?
00:10:13.880,00:10:15.360,I am unarmed.
00:10:20.080,00:10:21.760,"It's curious, Inspector."
00:10:22.320,00:10:25.080,I thought you came here to clean up the city.
00:10:25.160,00:10:27.280,Not to sleep with its whores.
00:10:29.400,00:10:33.080,You're no different from any other copper that came before you.
00:10:33.280,00:10:37.440,I'm no different from those who would follow should I choose to leave.
00:10:39.760,00:10:43.280,"- You have what you came for. - Yes, I have what I came for."
00:10:44.960,00:10:48.120,I have a meeting with Mr Winston Churchill at midday.
00:10:49.040,00:10:53.280,I've no doubt he intends to congratulate me on finding those stolen guns.
00:10:54.440,00:10:57.880,"And you still don't know how we found them, do you?"
00:10:59.320,00:11:00.400,Good.
00:11:00.480,00:11:02.040,"No, you got lucky."
00:11:02.120,00:11:03.160,Did I?
00:11:03.560,00:11:04.480,Yeah.
00:11:05.680,00:11:07.920,One thing I have learnt.
00:11:09.440,00:11:14.320,Is that you and I are opposites but also just the same.
00:11:16.320,00:11:18.040,Like an image in a mirror.
00:11:20.920,00:11:23.360,We hate people.
00:11:25.000,00:11:28.120,And they in turn hate us.
00:11:29.480,00:11:31.240,And fear us.
00:11:35.440,00:11:42.280,"Before the day is over, your heart will be broken, just the same as mine."
00:11:46.280,00:11:51.480,"Men like us, Mr Shelby, will always be alone."
00:11:53.200,00:11:58.040,"And what love we get, we will have to pay for."
00:11:59.400,00:12:02.040,"You forget, Inspector."
00:12:03.480,00:12:04.800,I have my family.
00:12:08.520,00:12:10.040,Enjoy your day.
00:12:22.240,00:12:24.000,"Oh, little one."
00:12:24.080,00:12:26.360,You're much better with him than I am.
00:12:28.040,00:12:31.520,He settles quicker with me because he can't smell the milk.
00:12:31.600,00:12:32.800,You look tired.
00:12:32.880,00:12:34.120,Let's put him down.
00:12:39.560,00:12:41.800,Mine were terrors for the tit.
00:12:42.480,00:12:43.920,Both of them.
00:12:44.800,00:12:47.200,"Well, you never knew my children, did you?"
00:12:47.280,00:12:49.040,I was a child myself then.
00:12:54.120,00:12:55.680,Never had reason to.
00:12:59.600,00:13:02.240,My heart breaks even when I think about them.
00:13:06.080,00:13:09.680,But today- I do have reason to.
00:13:10.520,00:13:11.920,"Sit down, Ada."
00:13:21.200,00:13:23.280,They were three and five years old.
00:13:25.200,00:13:26.440,Sally was three.
00:13:26.520,00:13:28.040,Michael was five. Well...
00:13:29.160,00:13:31.160,Two weeks away from being six.
00:13:33.640,00:13:35.000,It was Sunday morning.
00:13:35.360,00:13:36.960,While I was at church.
00:13:40.680,00:13:47.880,You're not forgiven this pinch-faced bitch said to me. You are not forgiven.
00:13:48.400,00:13:53.320,"You see, some sheets I washed and hung on the line had the name of a hotel on them."
00:13:53.400,00:13:55.320,They'd been stolen in a robbery.
00:13:55.400,00:13:58.600,And they said some porter at the hotel had been coshed.
00:13:59.200,00:14:02.760,And a women from round here told the police I had the sheets.
00:14:02.840,00:14:04.960,"Jealous, you see, of the new sheets."
00:14:05.040,00:14:12.240,"And when the police came, they found a spirit still for making a few drops of Gin."
00:14:15.800,00:14:17.120,And for that...
00:14:20.000,00:14:22.360,They took my children from me.
00:14:24.800,00:14:27.400,And they never told me where they took them.
00:14:28.480,00:14:31.680,And they did it because they could. Because I was weak.
00:14:32.200,00:14:34.920,But they'll never take your baby away from you.
00:14:35.360,00:14:36.680,Do you know why?
00:14:37.520,00:14:39.360,Because Tommy wouldn't let them.
00:14:39.920,00:14:42.600,Because Tommy won't let them walk all over us.
00:14:43.200,00:14:47.120,Now it is Tommy that has brought strength and power to this family.
00:14:50.400,00:14:53.920,You have to be as bad as them above in order want to survive.
00:14:55.960,00:14:59.240,I'm telling you this because I want you to forgive him.
00:14:59.320,00:15:00.240,How can I?
00:15:00.680,00:15:03.600,When my Freddie is rotting in jail because of him.
00:15:04.200,00:15:07.200,There's something about today that you need to know.
00:15:21.200,00:15:23.320,"Alright Freddie, time to go."
00:15:23.400,00:15:25.720,I want you to get a message to Campbell.
00:15:26.040,00:15:28.200,I can't let them move me to Brixton.
00:15:29.880,00:15:33.440,- If I get to Brixton they'll kill me. - Freddie.
00:15:34.280,00:15:37.080,You're not going to get as far as Brixton prison.
00:15:38.720,00:15:40.120,On your feet.
00:15:41.240,00:15:50.200,I told the Prime Minister personally that the guns had been retrieved and he actually heard me and listened and I'm pretty sure he gave me a half smile.
00:15:50.280,00:15:53.600,He never usually smiles unless a political opponent dies.
00:15:55.240,00:15:59.040,I plan to put your name forward in the New Year's Honors list.
00:16:00.680,00:16:04.040,"- That would be too much, Sir. - Nonsense. You deserve it."
00:16:04.560,00:16:09.720,"As I recall, you wrote to me several times about an undercover operative. A woman."
00:16:12.240,00:16:14.440,Was she involved in the discovery?
00:16:28.280,00:16:29.480,Yes.
00:16:30.040,00:16:31.560,She was instrumental.
00:16:32.200,00:16:34.880,A truly loyal servant of the crown.
00:16:34.960,00:16:37.320,And that is what the record should state.
00:16:38.000,00:16:40.800,And what of the men who actually stole the guns?
00:16:40.880,00:16:44.200,"The Peaky-- Blinders, Sir."
00:16:46.960,00:16:54.560,If we were to make arrests the whole thing would end up in open court and I know we wish to keep this matter confidential.
00:16:54.640,00:16:56.120,So they'll go free?
00:16:56.200,00:16:57.440,"Not quite, Sir."
00:16:58.960,00:17:02.600,"You see, I have plans for the Peaky Blinders."
00:17:06.560,00:17:07.680,Alright.
00:17:13.360,00:17:19.920,Right. I've got you all here today because this is the day that we replace Billy Kimber.
00:17:20.440,00:17:22.920,This is the day we become respectable.
00:17:23.000,00:17:30.000,The day we join the official National Association of Race Course Bookmakers.
00:17:31.640,00:17:34.720,But first we do the dirty work.
00:17:35.080,00:17:37.320,We've all known this days been coming.
00:17:37.400,00:17:39.560,I just haven't told anybody the date.
00:17:42.320,00:17:44.320,We're going to the Worcester races.
00:17:44.400,00:17:47.160,The track opens at one. We'll get there at two.
00:17:47.240,00:17:51.600,"Now, Kimber thinks we're going there to help him to fight the Lee brothers."
00:17:51.680,00:17:58.400,"But thanks to the efforts of our John and his lovely new wife Esme, the Lees are now our kin."
00:17:59.000,00:18:07.080,"I interrupted those efforts this morning and- but I can assure you all, John is making great sacrifices for the cause of peace."
00:18:07.160,00:18:08.760,Yeah. All right.
00:18:08.840,00:18:12.840,So it'll be us and the Lees against Kimber's boys.
00:18:13.360,00:18:15.640,We take them out but leave the bookies.
00:18:16.600,00:18:25.160,"I expect a swift victory which will send a signal all the way to London, that we believe in letting legitimate businesses run peacefully."
00:18:26.000,00:18:29.200,And what about Kimber himself?
00:18:30.120,00:18:31.800,I'll deal with Kimber.
00:18:32.240,00:18:33.560,Any other questions?
00:18:35.280,00:18:36.280,Yes.
00:18:39.160,00:18:42.480,Does anybody object if I bring a newcomer to the meeting?
00:18:46.600,00:18:47.800,Come on.
00:18:50.440,00:18:54.400,I'd like to introduce the newest member of the Shelby clan.
00:19:04.480,00:19:06.040,"Welcome home, Ada."
00:19:07.520,00:19:08.920,We named him Karl.
00:19:09.520,00:19:11.000,After Karl Marx.
00:19:11.480,00:19:12.680,Karl Bloody Marx.
00:19:12.760,00:19:14.240,Let me get a look at him.
00:19:14.320,00:19:15.600,Here we go.
00:19:15.680,00:19:19.080,"Hey, look. He looks just like me."
00:19:19.160,00:19:21.720,"That's his arse that looks like you, Arthur."
00:19:21.800,00:19:23.440,He's alright.
00:19:23.520,00:19:24.840,He's a Shelby.
00:19:25.360,00:19:26.880,Well. Ada?
00:19:28.240,00:19:29.640,Am I forgiven?
00:19:30.240,00:19:33.240,"If what Aunt Polly says is true, you are."
00:19:35.480,00:19:36.760,It's true.
00:19:39.560,00:19:41.040,"Thank you, Tommy."
00:19:50.480,00:19:52.360,They came to my house.
00:19:53.040,00:19:55.000,Told me to volunteer for this.
00:19:55.400,00:19:56.760,Who did?
00:19:57.520,00:19:59.240,The Peaky Blinders.
00:20:06.240,00:20:08.200,"Tommy, Tommy, Tommy."
00:21:01.560,00:21:03.000,Get out of the way.
00:21:05.600,00:21:09.520,- What the bloody hell is that? - Looks like your friends are here.
00:21:13.760,00:21:15.600,Stay down on the ground.
00:21:15.680,00:21:17.240,Or the next one's for you.
00:21:22.240,00:21:23.920,Make it look good.
00:21:24.000,00:21:26.040,I am sorry about this comrade.
00:21:27.520,00:21:32.000,"- Holy shit! Danny, you're dead. - Yeah. I've been living in London."
00:21:32.440,00:21:34.920,Same thing. In you get.
00:21:42.200,00:21:43.840,"All right, lads, listen up."
00:21:43.920,00:21:47.280,"You have a pint and a chaser, no more. On the house."
00:21:48.520,00:21:51.160,Right. Let's get pouring.
00:21:52.200,00:21:56.800,Do you have the enclosure tickets and a register of book keepers on the track?
00:21:56.880,00:21:58.200,In me coat.
00:21:59.160,00:22:00.720,"You did a good job, Grace."
00:22:05.880,00:22:09.400,"The next family meeting, I'll make sure you're there."
00:22:10.480,00:22:13.400,If I were family but I'm not.
00:22:14.760,00:22:16.120,That could change.
00:22:17.280,00:22:20.880,- Tommy? - We'll talk about it more when I get back. Alright?
00:22:20.960,00:22:24.560,- When will you be back? - Now is this how you're going to be?
00:22:24.640,00:22:28.360,"You waiting at home for me saying, What time do you call this?"
00:22:29.920,00:22:31.600,The barrel needs changing.
00:22:34.840,00:22:39.040,"Go on Tommy, go out the back and give her a good seeing to before we go."
00:22:46.960,00:22:48.120,Grace.
00:22:48.760,00:22:50.920,"Hey, Grace, I was joking."
00:22:58.200,00:23:02.840,"Tommy, the truth is when you get back from the races I won't be here."
00:23:03.560,00:23:05.160,What are you talking about?
00:23:07.240,00:23:11.400,"Alright, look. Grace, I know you weren't born to be with a man like me."
00:23:13.600,00:23:15.400,But I'm turning things around.
00:23:15.840,00:23:24.560,"When I get back here tonight, I will have one of the biggest legal racetrack syndicates in the country."
00:23:26.280,00:23:29.280,And I'm going to close down some of the other stuff.
00:23:30.920,00:23:34.080,"Maybe open up a club, hey?"
00:23:36.760,00:23:38.200,And another thing.
00:23:40.880,00:23:42.920,You have a contract of employment.
00:23:43.360,00:23:47.160,"With a real Limited company, you remember?"
00:23:47.880,00:23:49.800,"I remember everything, Tommy."
00:23:49.880,00:23:52.040,I am going to make a success of this.
00:23:53.000,00:23:55.760,I am going to make a success of it. I am.
00:23:55.840,00:23:57.520,I know. I know.
00:23:59.360,00:24:01.240,I'm not talking about marriage.
00:24:05.160,00:24:06.640,We know each other.
00:24:06.920,00:24:08.200,We can talk.
00:24:08.760,00:24:10.200,We are the same.
00:24:10.720,00:24:13.640,"Tommy, I have done something terrible to you."
00:24:16.560,00:24:18.720,"Right, tell him what you just told me."
00:24:18.800,00:24:22.160,Just heard there's two vans driving up the Stratford Road.
00:24:22.240,00:24:25.680,An old corporal of mine said he recognized some of the men.
00:24:25.760,00:24:29.000,He said it's Kimber's boys and they're heading this way.
00:24:34.040,00:24:38.960,"Ada, wake up. You and the baby get into the Bull Ring, where there's lots of people."
00:24:39.040,00:24:41.920,- What's going on? - We've been fucking betrayed.
00:24:42.000,00:24:45.120,"Somebody let slip, Kimber's men are on their way here."
00:24:45.200,00:24:48.000,- But you can handle them Tommy? - It's just us.
00:24:48.080,00:24:51.040,All the Lees are all on their way to the Worcester.
00:24:51.120,00:24:52.560,We're outnumbered. Fuck!
00:24:52.640,00:24:56.000,Who else knew today was the day you were moving on Kimber?
00:24:56.080,00:24:59.040,You said you kept it secret. Who else did you tell?
00:25:00.480,00:25:04.560,There's only one thing could blind a man as smart as you Tommy. Love.
00:25:04.960,00:25:06.360,It was that barmaid.
00:25:09.200,00:25:10.560,I will deal with Grace.
00:25:11.600,00:25:14.480,"If you set eyes on her again, you might kill her."
00:25:31.600,00:25:32.840,Going for good?
00:25:32.920,00:25:34.360,I heard there's trouble.
00:25:34.440,00:25:36.560,Instinct is a funny thing.
00:25:37.200,00:25:42.880,"See, normally I can tell about a person. But with you-- Look, the fighting is about to begin."
00:25:42.960,00:25:45.920,- We should get out of here. - We know who you are.
00:25:48.640,00:25:49.960,Tommy knows as well.
00:25:50.040,00:25:53.240,Turns out that copper as good as told him this morning.
00:25:53.320,00:25:55.800,But I wanted to hear it from your lips.
00:26:01.440,00:26:03.280,I am an agent of the crown.
00:26:03.360,00:26:06.560,I have the power to arrest and the right to use force.
00:26:06.640,00:26:09.680,So please step out of my way.
00:26:09.760,00:26:12.000,"Like I say, instinct is a funny thing."
00:26:12.080,00:26:14.440,"You fell for Tommy for real, didn't you?"
00:26:15.240,00:26:16.840,This gun is loaded.
00:26:17.200,00:26:18.640,I'm not afraid of you.
00:26:22.000,00:26:23.400,Slip of a thing.
00:26:23.480,00:26:26.520,You thought you'd come in here and stitch us all up.
00:26:26.600,00:26:29.600,We've had some coppers narks in here before but you?
00:26:29.680,00:26:31.360,You're the Queen of them all.
00:26:33.480,00:26:34.880,So who are you?
00:26:36.600,00:26:38.400,"A little rich girl, I'd guess?"
00:26:39.200,00:26:40.680,Unionist?
00:26:41.080,00:26:42.920,An Ulster Volunteer?
00:26:44.040,00:26:52.000,"You thought Fenians, communists, low people, they're all the same."
00:26:52.400,00:26:53.640,Scum.
00:26:54.400,00:26:55.960,Then you met Tommy.
00:27:01.040,00:27:04.760,I'd fight you with my fists and show you how a rich girl fights.
00:27:04.840,00:27:06.520,I'm from a tough family too.
00:27:14.000,00:27:15.280,No.
00:27:17.360,00:27:19.240,We women have more sense.
00:27:20.760,00:27:22.840,Why don't you pour us both a drink?
00:27:35.520,00:27:36.760,So am I right?
00:27:40.960,00:27:42.440,Did you fall for Tommy?
00:27:51.320,00:27:52.360,Yes.
00:27:52.680,00:27:53.960,Then I pity you.
00:27:55.120,00:27:56.840,I think he'll try to kill me.
00:27:57.840,00:27:59.040,He's too soft.
00:27:59.120,00:28:02.600,- Soft? - Soft like you.
00:28:03.360,00:28:06.080,You saved his life the night the coppers came.
00:28:06.800,00:28:09.280,That's why we're drinking and not fighting.
00:28:10.320,00:28:11.600,We owe you.
00:28:17.800,00:28:21.560,"What was he like, before France?"
00:28:23.040,00:28:26.000,"He laughed, a lot."
00:28:27.640,00:28:29.480,He wanted to work with horses.
00:28:31.960,00:28:33.120,He won medals.
00:28:33.200,00:28:34.520,Threw them in the Cut.
00:28:40.560,00:28:46.760,"You know, after all this is over, he might forgive you."
00:28:46.840,00:28:49.760,He might take you in. You can never tell with men.
00:28:49.840,00:28:54.360,They go for whoever their dicks point at and there's no changing their minds.
00:28:54.440,00:28:56.360,But I should tell you something.
00:28:57.600,00:28:59.160,"I will never forgive you,."
00:29:00.600,00:29:02.080,Or accept you.
00:29:03.160,00:29:04.520,Or take you in.
00:29:05.960,00:29:09.320,And it's me who runs business of the heart in this family.
00:29:10.640,00:29:15.120,"And as far as I'm concerned, you're a snitch from the Parish."
00:29:16.160,00:29:21.440,"And if you're not gone from this city by tomorrow, I'll kill you myself."
00:29:27.560,00:29:28.560,Now go.
00:29:43.120,00:29:48.280,"Maybe what really upsets you, is the thought that one day you might lose him."
00:29:58.920,00:30:04.480,Tommy. We've had word from Nipper at Hay Mills and he says the police are letting them through.
00:30:04.560,00:30:07.160,And how come all our police have disappeared?
00:30:07.240,00:30:10.600,Because it was the police who told Kimber about the plan.
00:30:10.680,00:30:13.480,- And who told the police? - You know what John?
00:30:13.560,00:30:17.120,"For all I think I'm the smartest one, I'm guessing it was me."
00:30:20.040,00:30:21.440,"All right, men."
00:30:21.520,00:30:28.280,You were mostly in the war so you know battle plans always change and get fucked up.
00:30:28.360,00:30:29.920,Well here it is.
00:30:30.000,00:30:31.400,Things have changed.
00:30:31.480,00:30:34.240,We fight them here. Today. Alone.
00:30:34.320,00:30:36.360,Now they're gonna come for the pub.
00:30:36.440,00:30:38.960,They're gonna try and break us up for good.
00:30:39.040,00:30:41.480,And we'll have no help from the law today.
00:30:42.760,00:30:44.960,That pub there is called the Garrison.
00:30:45.160,00:30:46.920,Well now it really is one.
00:30:47.000,00:30:49.240,"And it belongs to us, right?"
00:30:50.680,00:30:53.760,- How many are there? - Jeremiah says two Riley vans.
00:30:53.840,00:30:56.760,So I reckon we're outnumbered three to one.
00:30:58.040,00:31:00.680,But it's us boys. It's us.
00:31:00.760,00:31:04.800,"The Small Heath Rifles. We never lost a fight yet, did we?"
00:31:07.560,00:31:11.040,I know you vowed to God you'd never pick up a weapon again.
00:31:11.120,00:31:14.880,But can you ask him from me if you can help us today?
00:31:15.280,00:31:17.880,"God says he don't deal with Small Heath, sir."
00:31:20.200,00:31:21.600,You'll take the flanks.
00:31:21.680,00:31:23.600,- Just like at St. Marie. - Sure.
00:31:23.680,00:31:28.000,"Curly, when a Shelby man dies here today, you bury us side by side."
00:31:31.640,00:31:33.440,Make your peace with whoever.
00:31:36.760,00:31:41.400,We've had reports of a large group of men in vehicles heading towards the city.
00:31:41.480,00:31:44.040,"Most of them are known to the police, sir."
00:31:44.760,00:31:47.440,We think a gang fight's about to break out.
00:31:47.520,00:31:52.160,I want all officers and constables stood down in the following areas.
00:31:52.560,00:31:57.480,"Bordesley, Small Heath, Shard End, Greet and Hay Mills."
00:31:57.560,00:31:59.560,- Stood down Sir? - Immediately.
00:31:59.640,00:32:03.160,And the vehicles approaching the city should not be impeded.
00:32:03.240,00:32:05.960,- What the hell is going on? - Let dog eat dog.
00:32:07.520,00:32:09.880,Let the beasts devour each other.
00:32:11.240,00:32:13.800,And then we shall pick the bones.
00:32:28.120,00:32:29.480,She's gone then?
00:32:36.560,00:32:40.440,"You're not accustomed to not getting what you want, are you Tommy?"
00:32:42.760,00:32:44.960,You wanted my pub and you took it.
00:32:55.240,00:32:56.800,You got a fair price.
00:33:00.400,00:33:02.840,What I got was an ultimatum.
00:33:03.480,00:33:05.240,Like you give to everybody.
00:33:05.320,00:33:07.040,Do it or else.
00:33:08.240,00:33:10.320,And yet it's funny.
00:33:11.120,00:33:12.840,Everybody round here...
00:33:12.920,00:33:15.080,They want you to win this battle.
00:33:17.560,00:33:22.640,"I think what it is, you're bad men but you're our bad men."
00:33:26.920,00:33:28.680,Will you go looking for her?
00:33:32.800,00:33:34.320,She is in the past.
00:33:37.840,00:33:39.880,And the past is not my concern.
00:33:43.520,00:33:46.200,And the future is no longer my concern either.
00:33:46.280,00:33:47.880,What is your concern Tommy?
00:33:50.400,00:33:51.640,The one minute.
00:33:55.280,00:33:56.840,The soldier's minute.
00:33:58.920,00:34:00.800,In a battle that's all you get.
00:34:03.720,00:34:05.800,One minute of everything at once.
00:34:10.280,00:34:12.280,And anything before is nothing.
00:34:14.880,00:34:18.120,"Everything after, nothing."
00:34:20.920,00:34:24.960,Nothing in comparison to that one minute.
00:34:39.760,00:34:41.240,"It seems not, doesn't it?"
00:35:31.760,00:35:34.320,"Get your weapons out boys, and load them up."
00:35:38.800,00:35:40.320,Take your time.
00:35:52.160,00:35:55.800,"All guns and no balls, right, Billy boy?"
00:36:04.640,00:36:06.600,So what do we do now?
00:36:06.680,00:36:08.320,Just give the order.
00:36:31.280,00:36:35.000,The men who have arrived in Garrison Lane are armed with rifles.
00:36:36.760,00:36:38.080,Did you hear me?
00:36:38.640,00:36:41.960,Their methods of self-destruction are not my concern.
00:36:42.440,00:36:46.320,We have also had a report of machine gun fire in Saltleigh.
00:36:46.600,00:36:49.320,The ravings of an old soldier with shell shock.
00:36:49.400,00:36:52.760,We only found twenty-four of those twenty-five Lewis guns.
00:36:52.840,00:37:04.080,If they were to get to use the one-- You know when- when you came here from Belfast I was overjoyed.
00:37:04.920,00:37:08.520,I was sick of this force and I was sick of all the corruption.
00:37:08.600,00:37:14.560,"When you made that speech about cleaning this place up, I gave a little cheer inside."
00:37:17.040,00:37:20.240,You said it was the devil's work to look the other way.
00:37:20.320,00:37:23.400,"I am not looking the other way, Sergeant Moss."
00:37:23.480,00:37:26.200,I am looking directly at the events of the day.
00:37:26.800,00:37:28.760,And I like what I see.
00:37:36.200,00:37:38.560,"It doesn't have to be like this, Kimber."
00:37:39.080,00:37:40.560,Too late for all that.
00:37:40.640,00:37:43.840,"You bit off more than you can chew, you little toe rag."
00:37:43.920,00:37:46.360,And now we're taking over this shit hole.
00:37:46.880,00:37:52.120,"Well... If we have to use guns, let's use proper guns."
00:37:57.960,00:38:01.640,"Sergeant Thorne reporting for duty, Sir."
00:38:04.000,00:38:06.840,You were saying something about being out-gunned?
00:38:27.920,00:38:30.520,I believe you boys call this 'no-man's land'.
00:38:30.600,00:38:32.200,- Ada! - Shut up and listen.
00:38:32.280,00:38:34.840,- Have you lost your mind? - I said shut up!
00:38:37.040,00:38:38.920,Now most of you were in France.
00:38:39.560,00:38:41.560,So you all know what happens next.
00:38:47.320,00:38:50.120,"Now, I'm wearing black in preparation."
00:38:52.240,00:38:54.240,I want you to look at me.
00:38:57.120,00:38:59.400,I want you all to look at me.
00:39:03.680,00:39:05.040,Think about them.
00:39:05.920,00:39:07.720,Think about them right now.
00:39:08.760,00:39:13.320,And fight if you want to but that baby ain't moving anywhere.
00:39:14.920,00:39:16.400,And neither am I.
00:39:21.760,00:39:23.000,She's right you know.
00:39:24.520,00:39:26.520,Why should all you men die.
00:39:37.680,00:39:40.240,You're all right son. You're all right.
00:39:46.560,00:39:48.640,Hold your guns up.
00:39:50.640,00:39:51.920,Enough!
00:39:59.760,00:40:02.840,Kimber and me fought this battle one on one.
00:40:04.160,00:40:05.280,It's over.
00:40:11.320,00:40:12.920,Go home to your families.
00:40:44.000,00:40:46.960,"Scudboat, Curly. Pick him up."
00:41:18.120,00:41:20.080,I want to ask you one question.
00:41:20.360,00:41:21.600,Then I'll leave.
00:41:22.600,00:41:24.480,Tommy knows who I am.
00:41:24.560,00:41:26.200,What did you say to him?
00:41:27.560,00:41:29.480,What did you say to him?
00:41:34.360,00:41:40.640,I told him-- that his heart would be broken before the day was over.
00:41:43.200,00:41:48.400,"So it seems you've broken two hearts, Grace."
00:41:52.040,00:41:53.440,As well as my own.
00:42:10.120,00:42:11.560,Hold him still!
00:42:12.400,00:42:14.640,Come on! Come on!
00:42:18.280,00:42:20.400,There. I still have the knack.
00:42:23.680,00:42:24.840,Have a drink.
00:42:29.160,00:42:30.560,All right. Deep breath!
00:42:32.080,00:42:33.920,That's it! It's done!
00:42:57.400,00:42:59.440,Now we can bury him properly.
00:42:59.800,00:43:01.880,In the grave we dug for him.
00:43:03.680,00:43:04.600,Yeah.
00:43:05.480,00:43:07.160,It's high on a hill.
00:43:07.240,00:43:08.720,He'd like that.
00:43:17.200,00:43:19.200,- To Danny Whizz-Bang. - Danny.
00:43:19.280,00:43:21.200,May we all die twice.
00:43:24.760,00:43:26.280,To Danny Whizz-Bang.
00:43:29.640,00:43:31.000,Danny Whizz-Bang.
00:43:50.400,00:43:54.040,"Come on, the day is ours. Let's celebrate."
00:44:17.840,00:44:18.960,Well?
00:44:20.040,00:44:21.280,Who won?
00:44:22.760,00:44:27.720,A Mr William Kimber has been found dead with a gun shot wound.
00:44:28.320,00:44:32.520,So I'm guessing that means the Peaky Blinders won.
00:44:32.760,00:44:33.760,Sir.
00:44:36.080,00:44:42.920,Also the Communist agitator Freddie Thorne was taken from his transport by armed men.
00:44:44.480,00:44:51.800,"Since there were no officers on the street at the time following your orders, he managed to escape easily and is now at large."
00:44:53.040,00:44:55.960,The prison officers said they recognized the men.
00:44:56.040,00:44:58.760,"They were Peaky Blinders as well, Sir."
00:45:00.480,00:45:05.640,I mean we could go down there and make a few arrests but no one will have seen anything.
00:45:06.080,00:45:08.920,"And there were no officers there to witness, Sir."
00:45:10.760,00:45:13.160,The Shelbys will get away with murder.
00:45:14.000,00:45:15.720,Just like they always have.
00:45:17.360,00:45:20.800,"Some things never change, eh sir?"
00:45:49.040,00:45:51.040,To Shelby Limited!
00:45:59.120,00:46:00.840,Should we find work for them?
00:46:00.920,00:46:02.680,No. Let them be.
00:46:51.000,00:46:53.760,Could you put me through to Mr Churchill please?
00:46:55.840,00:46:57.000,"Yes, Sir."
00:46:58.040,00:47:03.200,"Sir, I've made a decision about my future."
00:47:17.920,00:47:19.520,Everyone's leaving town.
00:47:21.040,00:47:22.960,"- Tommy, you're hurt. - I'm fine."
00:47:25.680,00:47:27.240,What exactly can I say?
00:47:27.320,00:47:28.520,"I don't know, Grace."
00:47:31.400,00:47:33.320,I could tell you who I really am.
00:47:33.760,00:47:35.400,I think I know who you are.
00:47:37.080,00:47:38.400,And you know who I am.
00:47:38.480,00:47:40.520,The circumstance is not important.
00:47:41.720,00:47:42.960,Circumstance?
00:47:43.040,00:47:44.280,Is all it is.
00:47:46.080,00:47:47.400,Just uniform.
00:47:48.560,00:47:49.800,Yeah.
00:47:55.000,00:47:57.520,Some day I will throw this gun in the canal.
00:47:58.400,00:47:59.960,Why not now?
00:48:10.280,00:48:11.800,"Here it comes, Tommy."
00:48:14.720,00:48:16.080,I love you.
00:48:18.760,00:48:20.840,"And there it goes, Grace."
00:48:22.800,00:48:24.400,Away it goes.
00:48:25.920,00:48:32.560,We can say it as much as we like-- but there is no chance.
00:48:45.520,00:48:48.440,I'll be in London one week. At this address.
00:48:49.080,00:48:51.440,Finish your business here and join me.
00:48:53.800,00:48:55.440,I have an idea.
00:49:14.760,00:49:15.880,Drink?
00:49:20.960,00:49:22.480,Not whiskey.
00:49:25.480,00:49:31.920,"If you check behind the bar, you will find a bottle of Champagne."
00:49:41.880,00:49:43.440,The one she bought.
00:49:50.400,00:49:51.960,Today was a good day.
00:49:56.200,00:50:02.720,"All of Kimber's men were busy here, so the Lee boys took all their pitches at the Worcester races."
00:50:05.600,00:50:08.400,It couldn't have gone better if we'd planned it.
00:50:08.480,00:50:16.600,Shelby Brothers Limited are now the third largest legal race track operation in the country.
00:50:17.920,00:50:21.360,"Only the Sabinis and the Solomons are bigger than us, boys."
00:50:25.440,00:50:28.000,And all my family is here to celebrate.
00:50:32.440,00:50:34.320,To Shelby Brother's Limited.
00:50:54.320,00:50:55.680,There'll be others.
00:51:04.440,00:51:05.760,To the others.
00:51:08.000,00:51:09.160,All of them.
00:51:41.360,00:51:43.120,Dear Grace.
00:51:43.200,00:51:48.120,Without a secretary I write my own letters and I write without malice.
00:51:49.520,00:51:51.720,I learnt long ago to hate my enemies.
00:51:52.840,00:51:54.800,But I've never loved one before.
00:52:00.000,00:52:05.400,The idea of New York is interesting but I have worked so hard for this day.
00:52:05.480,00:52:07.080,For this victory.
00:52:07.160,00:52:09.120,I have responsibilities here.
00:52:10.160,00:52:14.200,For people I need to protect and people who I love.
00:52:17.000,00:52:21.960,"Before the war, when I had an important decision to make, I used to flip a coin."
00:52:22.560,00:52:24.760,Perhaps that is what I will do again.
00:52:27.520,00:52:32.960,Polly tells me you fell in love for real and Polly is never wrong about matters of the heart.
00:52:36.320,00:52:39.040,I will give you my decision within three days.
00:52:43.600,00:52:44.840,Thomas Shelby.
