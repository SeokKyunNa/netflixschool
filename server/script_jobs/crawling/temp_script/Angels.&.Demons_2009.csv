00:04:33.406,00:04:37.443,We can't wait. The bulk of the antimatter is generated at start-up.
00:04:37.577,00:04:38.845,Put us back online.
00:04:39.612,00:04:42.715,"Do you want to call the director, or shall I?"

00:05:09.575,00:05:13.646,They're terrified. He wants us to wait. What do you think?
00:05:13.913,00:05:19.052,"I think if we don't harvest now, we never will."
00:05:24.023,00:05:27.894,Sending timing trigger now. Collisions imminent.
00:06:07.433,00:06:09.836,Collisions are active. We should be back online.
00:06:10.002,00:06:12.839,Capture should begin at any moment.
00:07:12.999,00:07:16.002,We have antimatter.
00:07:19.772,00:07:23.643,It's on a scale never seen before.
00:07:30.883,00:07:34.020,"Silvano, we've done it."
00:07:39.659,00:07:43.529,"We're in God's hands now, Vittoria."

00:48:38.582,00:48:43.453,"I elect as the most high pontiff, Dominic Scolamiero."
00:52:42.192,00:52:45.729,There was no consensus after the first ballot...
00:52:45.862,00:52:50.200,"...but Cardinal Baggia, the Italian, is the odds-on favorite...."
00:52:50.333,00:52:53.770,"There is no new Pope, but it is possible..."
00:52:53.904,00:52:58.308,"...that Cardinal Guidera, the Spaniard, is the most probable...."
00:52:58.441,00:53:04.848,"It is possible that Cardinal Ebner, from Germany, is the favorite...."

01:01:39.896,01:01:46.903,The Vatican will allow the crowd back into St. Peter's Square...

01:07:21.337,01:07:24.106,Power is off. Oxygen is very low.
01:07:24.240,01:07:26.375,Come in. Can you read me?

01:11:28.617,01:11:31.687,...the device will detonate just before midnight.
01:15:04.967,01:15:07.703,His Holiness Celestine V was murdered.
01:15:07.836,01:15:11.573,Is it so hard to believe it could happen again?
01:17:47.362,01:17:49.264,"Oh, my God."
01:17:49.398,01:17:51.333,Get him down!
01:28:17.458,01:28:19.494,Good evening. Can you help me?
01:28:19.861,01:28:22.030,I'm waiting for a doctor.
01:28:38.613,01:28:40.381,Come here.
01:28:43.084,01:28:45.787,Stay calm. Don't shoot.
01:42:39.186,01:42:44.358,I don't care who he talks to. He doesn't go into that room.
01:54:05.371,01:54:09.309,It was the camerlengo. He saved us all!
01:54:09.442,01:54:13.413,He saved the church and he is alive.
02:07:00.079,02:07:02.181,Crowds of the faithful are calling for...
02:07:02.314,02:07:06.318,...the camerlengo's immediate canonization and sainthood.
02:07:06.652,02:07:10.189,The Vatican also announced the death of three of its cardinals...
02:07:10.322,02:07:12.925,...in the fire at Santa Maria della Vittoria.

00:02:35.114,00:02:46.041,"Over the last several days Catholic leaders from every corner of the world have flocked to Rome, shocked by the sudden death of this progressive and beloved pope."
00:02:53.841,00:03:05.894,"Today, in St. Peter's Square, the faithful pray that there is among them another leader who can unite their Church, which has been so riven by change and dissent in recent years."
00:03:10.273,00:03:23.037,"As the body of the pontiff passes by, we see prayers are being offered by the preferiti, favorites among those being considered to succeed him as the Vicar of Christ."
00:03:32.046,00:03:53.358,"At the end of the mourning period, the College of Cardinals will lock itself behind the doors of the Sistine Chapel for conclave, the process by which they will choose a new leader for the world's one billion Catholics who now find their Church at a crossroads, its ancient traditions threatened by a modern world."

00:11:04.872,00:11:07.626,A matter of great urgency.
00:11:07.750,00:11:11.630,They said to show you this.
00:11:21.598,00:11:24.267,VINCENZI: The Illuminati? They disappeared hundreds of years ago.
00:11:24.309,00:11:26.186,LANGDON: Did they? Look at that again.
00:11:26.227,00:11:27.479,It's an ambigram.
00:11:27.521,00:11:29.772,It's the same image forward and backward.
00:11:29.814,00:11:34.402,"Now, that's common for a symbol, like a yin and yang or a swastika, but that's a word."
00:11:34.444,00:11:39.616,That Illuminati ambigramatic symbol has been considered a myth for 400 years.
00:11:39.658,00:11:45.539,"Supposedly, in the 16th century, some artist created it as a tribute to Galileo's love of symmetry."
00:11:45.580,00:11:51.836,It was only gonna be revealed when the Illuminati had amassed enough power to resurface and carry out their final goal.
00:11:51.878,00:11:52.962,I wrote a book about it.
00:11:54.381,00:11:55.965,Which is why you're here.

00:12:09.854,00:12:12.566,It's remarkable. Singular.
00:12:12.607,00:12:16.861,Someone is trying to make you believe the Illuminati themselves have returned to Rome.
00:12:16.903,00:12:18.363,Right after the death of a pope.
00:12:23.326,00:12:29.165,Four cardinals were kidnapped from their quarters inside the Vatican sometime between 3 and 5 a.m. this morning.
00:12:29.207,00:12:41.844,"Shortly afterward, that document was sent to the Office of the Swiss Guard, along with the threat the cardinals will be publicly executed one per hour, beginning at 8 p.m. tonight in Rome."
00:12:52.439,00:12:53.565,Conclave.
00:12:53.607,00:12:55.066,Was to begin today.
00:12:55.108,00:12:58.236,"We've postponed its start for a few hours, a story of illness."
00:12:58.278,00:13:01.615,There are no suspicions yet.
00:13:01.656,00:13:04.075,What do you want from me?
00:13:04.117,00:13:10.707,"These criminals who sent this ambigram, meant it as a taunt, a provocation."
00:13:10.749,00:13:17.964,"But Captain Olivetti think if you can use it to learn their identity, perhaps we can stop this abomination."
00:13:21.635,00:13:23.344,Why me?
00:13:23.386,00:13:25.472,Your expertise.
00:13:25.513,00:13:27.056,Your erudition.

00:13:33.730,00:13:38.901,I wasn't under the impression that episode had endeared me to the Vatican.
00:13:38.901,00:13:40.320,"Oh, it didn't."
00:13:40.361,00:13:45.199,But it did make you-- What's the word?
00:13:45.241,00:13:47.201,Formidable.
00:13:49.078,00:13:51.414,A Vatican jet is standing by 20 minutes from here.
00:13:51.456,00:13:52.791,Will you come with me?
00:14:01.382,00:14:07.180,"Professore Langdon, you've spent your life searching for symbols like the one you now hold in your hand."
00:14:07.221,00:14:11.601,How much longer are we going to pretend you have not already decided to come?
00:14:18.232,00:14:26.115,"VINCENZI: If the Illuminati have returned and are in Rome, we will hunt them down and kill them."
00:14:26.157,00:14:29.703,The Illuminati did not become violent until the 17th century.
00:14:29.744,00:14:31.454,Their name means the enlightened ones.
00:14:31.496,00:14:34.207,"They were physicists and mathematicians, astronomers."
00:14:34.248,00:14:39.962,"They were concerned with the Church's inaccurate teaching, and they were dedicated to scientific truth."
00:14:39.962,00:14:41.381,But the Vatican didn't like that.
00:14:41.422,00:14:43.633,So the Church began to-- How did you say it?
00:14:43.675,00:14:46.720,"Oh, hunt them down and kill them."
00:14:46.761,00:14:48.262,Drove them underground.
00:14:49.723,00:14:52.433,Into a secret society.
00:15:42.567,00:15:44.360,Professor Langdon.
00:15:44.402,00:15:47.071,Welcome to Vatican City.
00:15:47.113,00:15:50.700,"Ernesto Olivetti, inspector general of the Vatican police force."
00:15:50.742,00:15:52.869,My pleasure.
00:15:52.911,00:15:56.038,We'll meet in the headquarters of the Swiss Guard.
00:15:56.038,00:15:57.791,I thought you were Swiss Guard.
00:15:57.832,00:16:00.042,"No, la Gendarmeria."
00:16:00.042,00:16:08.760,"We are responsible for everything inside the Vatican walls, with the exception of the security of His Holiness, Yeah."
00:16:08.802,00:16:10.762,That is Swiss Guard.
00:16:10.804,00:16:14.474,The Roman carabinieri are here as well in an advisory capacity.
00:16:14.515,00:16:18.394,"So jurisdictionally, this is-- A goddamn nightmare."
00:16:25.276,00:16:28.195,"LANGDON: Oh, yes, Pope Pius IX's great castration."
00:16:28.237,00:16:29.781,OLIVETTI: I beg your pardon?
00:16:29.823,00:16:34.869,"LANGDON: 1857, Pope Pius IX felt the male form would inspire lust."
00:16:34.911,00:16:39.582,So he took a hammer and chisel and unmanned hundreds of these statues.
00:16:39.624,00:16:43.252,The plaster fig leaves were added later.
00:16:45.254,00:16:49.216,"Are you anti-Catholic, Professor Langdon?"
00:16:49.258,00:16:52.553,No.
00:16:56.098,00:16:59.352,I urge you to guard your tone here.
00:16:59.393,00:17:08.235,"The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession, and it encourages a certain zealotry."
00:17:08.277,00:17:14.868,"Commander Richter, the head of the Guard, is a deeply spiritual man, and he was close to the late pope. Understood?"
00:17:14.909,00:17:18.496,"Look, I don't study symbols because I consider them unimportant."
00:17:18.538,00:17:20.874,"Ceremony, traditions, it's how we mark our lives."
00:17:20.915,00:17:22.625,I just-- I just hope I can help.
00:17:22.667,00:17:24.377,So do I.
00:17:24.418,00:17:26.921,You were my idea.
00:17:38.307,00:17:40.810,Wait here. Please.
00:17:43.145,00:17:44.564,OLIVETTI: Commander?
00:17:44.605,00:17:46.148,Commander Richter?
00:17:46.148,00:17:48.776,Professor Langdon is here.
00:17:48.818,00:17:51.195,"Well, we have bigger problems than that now."
00:17:53.740,00:17:56.409,RICHTER: Dr. Vetra?
00:17:56.450,00:18:00.830,"I'm Commander Richter, comandante principale of the Swiss Guard."
00:18:00.872,00:18:02.164,Hello.
00:18:03.833,00:18:05.960,Professor Langdon.
00:18:06.002,00:18:08.588,"What a relief, the symbologist is here."
00:18:08.629,00:18:11.925,"This way, please, Miss Vetra."
00:18:11.966,00:18:14.385,The situation has changed.
00:18:14.427,00:18:17.889,We received another threat from the kidnapper.
00:18:17.931,00:18:20.975,VITTORIA: The canister was stolen from our lab around noon yesterday.
00:18:21.017,00:18:27.815,"The intruder killed my research partner, Silvano Bentivoglio, and mutilated him in order to bypass security."
00:18:27.857,00:18:29.859,We use retinal scanners.
00:18:29.901,00:18:32.653,They cut out his eye.
00:18:32.695,00:18:36.866,"RICHTER: Is that your stolen canister, Miss Vetra?"
00:18:36.908,00:18:38.952,"Where is that camera, Number 86?"
00:18:38.993,00:18:40.494,OLIVETTI: It's wireless.
00:18:40.536,00:18:42.622,It too was stolen. It could be anywhere inside the Vatican.
00:18:42.663,00:18:46.542,That canister contains an extremely combustible substance called antimatter.
00:18:46.584,00:18:49.295,We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City.
00:18:49.336,00:18:51.881,"I'm quite familiar with incendiaries, Miss Vetra."
00:18:51.923,00:18:54.216,I've never heard of antimatter being used as such.
00:18:54.216,00:18:57.303,"Well, it's never been generated in significant quantities before."
00:18:57.344,00:19:03.309,"It's a way of studying the origins of the universe, to try to isolate what some people call the God particle."
00:19:03.350,00:19:07.814,But there are implications for energy research-- The God particle?
00:19:07.855,00:19:10.608,What we call it isn't important.
00:19:10.650,00:19:12.401,It's what gives all matter mass.
00:19:12.443,00:19:14.528,The thing without which we could not exist.
00:19:14.570,00:19:17.364,You're talking about the moment of creation.
00:19:17.406,00:19:20.034,"Yes. In a way, I am."
00:19:20.076,00:19:25.665,The antimatter is suspended there in an airtight nanocomposite shell with electromagnets in each end.
00:19:25.706,00:19:34.966,"But if it were to fall out of suspension and come in contact with matter, say, the bottom of the canister, the two opposing forces would annihilate one another violently."
00:19:35.008,00:19:36.717,What might cause it to fall out of suspension?
00:19:36.759,00:19:38.970,The battery going dead.
00:19:39.012,00:19:41.514,"Which it will, just before midnight."
00:19:41.555,00:19:43.307,What kind of annihilation?
00:19:43.349,00:19:45.267,A cataclysmic event.
00:19:45.267,00:19:50.064,A blinding explosion equivalent to about five kilotons.
00:19:50.106,00:19:53.901,Vatican City will be consumed by light.
00:19:55.653,00:19:58.572,Those are the exact words the kidnapper used.
00:19:58.614,00:20:02.743,MAN: We will destroy your four pillars.
00:20:02.785,00:20:11.669,"We will brand your preferiti, and sacrifice them on the altars of science, then bring your church down upon you."
00:20:11.711,00:20:15.381,Vatican City will be consumed by light.
00:20:15.422,00:20:19.301,A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.
00:20:25.265,00:20:26.976,It's the ancient Illuminati threat.
00:20:27.018,00:20:28.936,Destruction of Vatican City through light.
00:20:30.354,00:20:34.150,"Four pillars, there's your kidnapped cardinals."
00:20:34.192,00:20:38.988,"You didn't tell me they were the preferiti, the favorites, to be named the next pope."
00:20:41.199,00:20:42.200,Play it again.
00:20:49.123,00:20:52.210,MAN: We will destroy your four pillars.
00:20:54.503,00:20:56.923,"We will brand your preferiti-- Wait, stop it. Stop it."
00:20:58.966,00:21:01.552,Brand them.
00:21:03.179,00:21:05.848,That's another Illuminati legend.
00:21:05.890,00:21:13.022,"This one says that there are a set of five brands, each one an ambigram."
00:21:13.064,00:21:17.693,"The first four are the fundamental elements of science: Earth, air, fire and water."
00:21:17.735,00:21:20.529,"The fifth, it's a mystery."
00:21:22.448,00:21:24.700,Maybe it's this.
00:21:24.742,00:21:26.827,He said they'd be killed publicly.
00:21:26.869,00:21:28.704,Yes.
00:21:28.746,00:21:31.457,Revenge for la purga.
00:21:31.498,00:21:33.126,La purga?
00:21:35.044,00:21:38.380,"Oh, jeez, you guys don't even read your own history, do you?"
00:21:38.422,00:21:50.768,"1668, the Church kidnapped four Illuminati scientists and branded each one of them on the chest with the symbol of the cross to purge them of their sins, and they executed them."
00:21:50.810,00:21:56.649,Threw their bodies into the street as a warning to others to stop questioning Church rulings on scientific matters.
00:21:56.690,00:21:58.442,They radicalized them.
00:21:58.484,00:22:04.198,"The purga created a darker, more violent Illuminati, one bent on retribution."
00:22:04.240,00:22:10.204,"And look how they intend to finally get it: Using antimatter, technology, to destroy the Church."
00:22:10.246,00:22:12.414,Science obliterates religion.
00:22:13.833,00:22:15.251,Is there any more?
00:22:17.295,00:22:23.676,"MAN: --and sacrifice them on the altars of science, then bring your church down upon you."
00:22:23.717,00:22:27.513,Vatican City will be consumed by light.
00:22:27.554,00:22:31.517,A shining star at the end of the Path of Illumination.
00:22:31.558,00:22:34.436,Path of Illumination.
00:22:37.064,00:22:39.275,I need access to the Vatican archives.
00:22:41.485,00:22:46.782,"Professor, I don't think this is the appropriate-- Your petition has been denied seven times."
00:22:46.824,00:22:48.534,"No, no. This has nothing to do with my work."
00:22:48.575,00:22:55.875,"The Path of Illumination is a trail through Rome that leads to the Church of the Illumination, the place where the Illuminati would meet in secret."
00:22:55.916,00:23:05.551,"If I can find the segno, the sign that marks the beginning of that path, the four churches along it may be where he intends to murder your cardinals."
00:23:05.592,00:23:09.096,"One every hour at 8, 9, 10 and 11."
00:23:09.138,00:23:11.891,Then the device explodes at midnight.
00:23:11.932,00:23:16.896,If we can figure out the first church and get there before he does maybe we can stop it.
00:23:16.937,00:23:20.941,But I can't find the start of the path until I get into the archives.
00:23:20.983,00:23:29.491,"Even if I wanted to help you, access to the archives is only by written decree by the curator and the Board of Vatican Librarians."
00:23:29.491,00:23:32.036,Or by papal mandate.
00:23:32.078,00:23:35.206,"Yes, but as you no doubt have heard, the Holy Father is dead."
00:23:35.248,00:23:37.375,What about il camerlengo?
00:23:37.499,00:23:41.003,"The camerlengo is just a priest here, the former pope's chamberlain."
00:23:41.045,00:23:44.965,Doesn't the power of the Holy See rest in him during tempe sede vacante?
00:23:52.681,00:23:55.809,"Fellas, you called me."
00:23:57.103,00:24:02.900,CAMERLENGO: His Holiness once told me a pope was a man torn between the real world and the divine.
00:24:02.942,00:24:06.904,It seems the real world is upon us tonight.
00:24:06.946,00:24:10.908,I'm familiar with Illuminati lore and the legend of the brandings.
00:24:10.950,00:24:14.370,La purga is a dark stain on this Church's history.
00:24:14.412,00:24:16.538,I'm not surprised this ghost has returned to haunt us.
00:24:19.541,00:24:23.421,"Comandante, have you begun the search for this explosive device?"
00:24:23.545,00:24:25.381,"Of course, but it could be anywhere."
00:24:25.423,00:24:28.008,My primary concern at the moment is the safety of the cardinals.
00:24:28.050,00:24:30.386,The Sistine Chapel is a fortress.
00:24:30.428,00:24:34.556,"As long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a minimum."
00:24:34.598,00:24:41.855,"Devote as many of your resources-- If you're about to suggest a naked-eye search of the entire Vatican City, I will tell you we do not have the people."
00:24:41.897,00:24:47.403,"Though I am not His Holiness, when you are addressing me, you are addressing this office."
00:24:49.655,00:24:50.906,"Yes, Father."
00:24:50.948,00:24:53.367,CAMERLENGO: Good.
00:24:53.409,00:24:58.289,"Now, you said the image on the screen was illuminated by artificial light."
00:24:58.331,00:25:02.960,Might I suggest methodically cutting power to various sections of the city.
00:25:03.002,00:25:07.714,"When the image goes dark, you'll have a specific idea of the camera's location."
00:25:11.344,00:25:18.600,"Dr. Vetra, besides yourself and your research partner, who else knew about this antimatter project?"
00:25:18.600,00:25:20.936,No one but the research team.
00:25:20.978,00:25:23.063,This project was strictly confidential.
00:25:23.105,00:25:25.274,But Silvano kept detailed journals.
00:25:25.316,00:25:29.945,"If he told anyone else about what we were doing, he would have made a note of it."
00:25:29.987,00:25:31.447,Do you have these journals?
00:25:31.489,00:25:33.615,I can have them flown here from Geneva in an hour.
00:25:33.615,00:25:34.616,Please.
00:25:37.161,00:25:38.496,Professor Langdon.
00:25:49.382,00:25:55.471,"Mr. Langdon, you are correct that I may grant you access to the archives."
00:25:57.431,00:25:59.308,"Thank you, Padre."
00:25:59.350,00:26:04.480,"I said that you were correct that I may, not that I will."
00:26:04.522,00:26:07.149,Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive.
00:26:08.859,00:26:17.117,"Given your recent entanglement with the Church, there is a question I'd like to ask you first, here, in the office of His Holiness."
00:26:25.000,00:26:26.835,"Do you believe in God, sir?"
00:26:30.672,00:26:37.679,"Father, I simply believe that religion-- I did not ask if you believe what man says about God."
00:26:37.679,00:26:39.681,I asked if you believe in God.
00:26:42.518,00:26:45.354,I'm an academic.
00:26:45.396,00:26:50.943,My mind tells me I will never understand God.
00:26:50.984,00:26:52.694,And your heart?
00:26:55.531,00:26:57.741,Tells me I'm not meant to.
00:26:59.243,00:27:03.289,Faith is a gift that I have yet to receive.
00:27:09.795,00:27:12.965,Be delicate with our treasures.
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.097,The archives are this way.
00:27:20.139,00:27:21.932,VITTORIA: Professor Langdon.
00:27:23.350,00:27:28.730,"If this path really leads to the Church of Illumination, that may be where they've hidden the antimatter."
00:27:28.730,00:27:31.191,A shining star at the end of the path. I thought so too.
00:27:31.233,00:27:34.403,"Follow the path, and we may find the canister at the end of it."
00:27:34.445,00:27:36.905,Can you deactivate the device?
00:27:34.445,00:27:39.032,"I can change the batteries, as long as we have more than five minutes of life."
00:27:39.074,00:27:43.412,That would give us another 24 hours to get it safely back to CERN.
00:27:45.247,00:27:46.373,Robert Langdon.
00:27:46.415,00:27:48.459,Vittoria Vetra.
00:27:48.501,00:27:52.171,"Are you really a symbologist, or was he mocking you?"
00:27:52.212,00:27:54.548,"Well, both."
00:27:54.590,00:27:56.091,Bio-entanglement physics.
00:27:56.133,00:27:57.759,Interconnectivity of life systems.
00:27:57.801,00:27:59.303,Okay.
00:27:59.345,00:28:02.389,"Your project, it was geared towards energy research?"
00:28:02.431,00:28:03.765,"Eventually, yes."
00:28:03.807,00:28:08.061,One speck of antimatter could power an entire city for a month.
00:28:08.103,00:28:10.772,"Or tonight, I guess, destroy one."
00:28:10.814,00:28:13.817,VITTORIA: What are we looking for in the archives?
00:28:13.859,00:28:15.569,A bound volume written by Galileo.
00:28:15.611,00:28:17.154,Galileo was Illuminati?
00:28:17.196,00:28:19.615,Yeah.
00:28:17.196,00:28:24.995,"And an obedient Catholic, who didn't think that Church and science were enemies, but just a different language telling the same story."
00:28:25.037,00:28:31.502,"He wanted like minds to find the Church of Illumination, but he couldn't exactly advertise its location so he created a coded path."
00:28:33.295,00:28:36.382,Richter has started to turn off the power of various grids.
00:28:36.423,00:28:37.383,It'll be back on in a minute.
00:28:39.218,00:28:43.138,Then some unknown Illuminati master sculpted four statues.
00:28:43.180,00:28:51.689,"Each one a tribute to one of the fundamental elements, earth, air, fire, water, and placed the statues out in public in churches throughout Rome."
00:28:51.813,00:28:54.525,Each statue held a clue pointing to the next.
00:28:54.567,00:28:57.277,At the end of the path was the Church of Illumination.
00:28:57.319,00:29:00.197,"If you could find that, you were one of them."
00:29:00.239,00:29:03.242,What makes you think he'll murder the cardinals in the churches?
00:29:03.283,00:29:09.873,"The Illuminati called those four churches by the special name, L'Altare della scienza."
00:29:09.915,00:29:12.834,"Sacrifice them on the altars of science, he said."
00:29:12.834,00:29:14.545,Exactly.
00:29:17.089,00:29:20.551,"Oh, wow. Look at this."
00:29:46.034,00:29:47.869,"CAMERLENGO: Excuse me, signore."
00:29:49.705,00:29:52.416,"Cardinal Strauss, you've been informed of the situation?"
00:29:52.458,00:29:54.376,Yeah.
00:29:54.418,00:29:58.255,My belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave.
00:29:58.297,00:30:02.134,At this late hour?
00:30:02.175,00:30:03.885,And yet within Church law.
00:30:03.927,00:30:05.845,It's in my power.
00:30:05.887,00:30:08.056,The cruelest honor in Christendom.
00:30:08.098,00:30:11.644,"I have no personal ambitions, Patrick."
00:30:11.685,00:30:18.776,"Only those I hold for my Church, St. Peter's Church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment."
00:30:18.817,00:30:20.152,And this is not a coincidence.
00:30:20.193,00:30:21.779,The Church will not fall in a day.
00:30:21.820,00:30:23.863,We must evacuate Vatican City.
00:30:23.905,00:30:26.742,"Oh, that is exactly what they want."
00:30:26.784,00:30:28.702,Publicity and panic.
00:30:28.744,00:30:32.956,"No, we must not give them oxygen for the media fire."
00:30:32.998,00:30:39.421,"But the people in St. Peter's Square-- Care deeply about their Church, as we do."
00:30:39.463,00:30:42.299,Their faith will sustain them.
00:30:42.341,00:30:44.635,Their faith will not protect them from an explosion.
00:30:44.677,00:30:46.470,Well...
00:30:46.512,00:30:51.266,"We all are bound for heaven eventually, are we not?"
00:30:51.308,00:30:54.394,Spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life.
00:30:54.436,00:31:02.736,"Patrick, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the Vatican."
00:31:04.655,00:31:11.119,"You were a favorite of His Holiness, but His Holiness is with his father now."
00:31:13.455,00:31:14.956,Mea culpa.
00:31:14.998,00:31:16.958,Seal the doors.
00:31:31.056,00:31:34.017,PATRICK: Extra Omnes.
00:32:26.820,00:32:29.615,"Hello. This way, please."
00:32:29.656,00:32:32.492,"Oh, beautiful."
00:32:36.538,00:32:38.832,GUARD: The chambers are hermetic vaults.
00:32:38.874,00:32:41.042,Oxygen is kept at lowest possible levels.
00:32:41.084,00:32:43.879,It's a partial vacuum inside.
00:32:43.921,00:32:46.381,So extended stays are not recommended.
00:32:46.423,00:32:49.301,LANGDON: So don't panic if you feel light-headed at first.
00:33:01.396,00:33:03.356,I'll be just outside the door.
00:33:03.398,00:33:06.276,"Watching you, Mr. Langdon."
00:33:55.408,00:33:57.577,Conclave will go on without us.
00:33:57.619,00:34:01.707,"It must, now of all times."
00:34:01.748,00:34:04.292,May God forgive you for what you've done.
00:34:12.384,00:34:18.682,"Father, if God has issues, they won't be with what I've done."
00:34:18.724,00:34:22.019,They will be with what I'm about to do.
00:34:43.164,00:34:48.587,LANGDON: It was confiscated from the Netherlands by the Vatican just after Galileo died.
00:34:48.628,00:34:54.217,"I've been petitioning to see it for about 10 years, ever since I realized wh-- What was in it."
00:34:54.259,00:34:56.053,What makes you so sure that the segno's there?
00:34:56.177,00:34:57.679,The number 503.
00:34:57.721,00:35:05.854,"I kept seeing it over and over again in Illuminati letters, scribbled in the margins, sometimes just signed 503."
00:35:05.896,00:35:07.773,It's a numeric clue.
00:35:07.814,00:35:10.817,"Five? Well, that's a meaningful number to the Illuminati."
00:35:10.859,00:35:14.195,"There's the pentagram, Pythagoras, dozens of other examples in science."
00:35:14.195,00:35:15.447,But what about three?
00:35:15.488,00:35:18.617,"Didn't make sense until I thought, What if it's Roman numerals?"
00:35:18.658,00:35:20.953,DIII.
00:35:20.994,00:35:22.788,Galileo's third text.
00:35:22.829,00:35:27.208,Dialogo. Discorso. Diagramma.
00:35:31.337,00:35:33.090,Oh.
00:35:33.214,00:35:34.633,Yeah.
00:35:38.553,00:35:46.227,"Just a few days with this, and I could have actually finished my book and sold dozens of copies at the Harvard bookstore."
00:35:46.269,00:35:48.814,Il Diagramma Veritatis.
00:35:48.855,00:35:51.232,Diagram of Truth.
00:35:51.232,00:35:53.860,I know about Dialogo and Discorsi.
00:35:53.902,00:35:57.781,Galileo laid out his theories about the Earth revolving around the sun.
00:35:57.823,00:36:03.703,"Yeah, and said the Earth was not the center of some universe with heaven above, hell below, as the Church had said it was."
00:36:03.745,00:36:05.538,So they forced him to recant in the second book.
00:36:05.580,00:36:07.749,But what was this one?
00:36:07.791,00:36:09.375,This is how he got the word out.
00:36:09.417,00:36:12.045,"This is the truth, not what the Vatican forced him to write."
00:36:12.087,00:36:15.590,"Smuggled out of Rome, printed in Holland on sedge papyrus."
00:36:15.632,00:36:21.888,"That way any scientist caught that was with a copy could just throw it in water, and Galileo's heresy would dissolve, disappear."
00:36:21.930,00:36:28.770,"And between that and Vatican burnings, it's possible that this is the only copy that remains."
00:36:28.812,00:36:37.403,"And if I'm correct, the Segno is hidden on page number-- Five."
00:36:37.445,00:36:38.947,Yeah.
00:36:45.871,00:36:47.288,Do you need help with the Latin?
00:36:48.373,00:36:49.499,Sure.
00:36:56.798,00:37:02.387,"Movement of the planets, elliptical orbits, heliocentricity."
00:37:04.806,00:37:09.435,"Sorry, I don't think there's anything that could be interpreted as a-- Wait, wait, wait."
00:37:09.477,00:37:11.730,Do that again.
00:37:13.314,00:37:14.191,What is that?
00:37:17.736,00:37:20.405,"Wait a minute, it's a watermark."
00:37:20.446,00:37:22.657,Go back.
00:37:23.825,00:37:25.326,It's in English.
00:37:25.326,00:37:28.830,English?
00:37:28.872,00:37:31.917,English wasn't used in the Vatican. It was too polluted.
00:37:31.958,00:37:34.711,It was free-thinking.
00:37:31.958,00:37:37.338,It was a language of radicals like Shakespeare and Chaucer.
00:37:37.338,00:37:38.464,Here's another one.
00:37:38.506,00:37:43.678,"The path of light is laid, the sacred test-- Will you write this down as I dictate?"
00:37:43.720,00:37:46.056,"Sorry, professor, no time."
00:37:50.936,00:37:54.355,"Yeah, yeah, what the hell. Yeah."
00:38:09.704,00:38:10.914,MAN: Twenty minutes till 8.
00:38:10.956,00:38:13.083,Where are we headed?
00:38:13.125,00:38:15.710,I'll tell you in a minute.
00:38:21.925,00:38:23.509,Where did you get that paper?
00:38:23.551,00:38:25.470,We borrowed it.
00:38:25.511,00:38:28.932,From Santi's earthly tomb with demon's hole.
00:38:28.974,00:38:30.100,Are you insane?
00:38:30.142,00:38:34.104,'Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.
00:38:34.146,00:38:36.982,"The path of light is laid, the sacred test."
00:38:37.023,00:38:41.194,Let angels guide thee on thy lofty quest.
00:38:41.236,00:38:44.864,You removed a document from the Vatican Archives?
00:38:44.906,00:38:46.241,She did.
00:38:51.037,00:38:53.414,From Santi's earthly tomb.
00:38:53.414,00:38:55.208,The first marker is at Santi's tomb.
00:38:55.250,00:38:56.835,Yeah.
00:38:56.876,00:38:59.420,But-- But who's Santi?
00:38:59.462,00:39:02.174,"Il Raffaello, the sculptor?"
00:39:02.215,00:39:04.092,So the path starts at Raphael's tomb.
00:39:04.134,00:39:06.427,Raphael's buried at the Pantheon.
00:39:06.427,00:39:07.929,Isn't the Pantheon a church?
00:39:07.971,00:39:09.514,Oldest Catholic church in Rome.
00:39:29.868,00:39:33.079,I just pulled a dozen of our best men for this.
00:39:33.121,00:39:34.580,You better be right.
00:39:34.622,00:39:36.624,This is one of the busiest spots in all of Rome.
00:39:36.666,00:39:38.626,He'd never get away with it.
00:39:38.668,00:39:41.838,The poem implies-- The poem? Unbelievable.
00:39:41.880,00:39:47.135,I'm basing this operation on an American's interpretation of a 400-year-old poem.
00:39:47.177,00:39:50.138,The information we have clearly refers to Raphael's tomb.
00:39:50.180,00:39:52.057,And Raphael's tomb is inside that building.
00:39:52.098,00:39:59.981,"Because the Vatican destroyed all of the pagan statues in the late-1800s, if this is the first marker, whatever clues were here to lead us are gone now."
00:40:00.023,00:40:02.817,"The path is dead. So this is it, your only chance."
00:40:05.195,00:40:06.863,Separate approaches.
00:40:06.905,00:40:10.575,RICHTER: No closer than two blocks and no uniforms. Three minutes.
00:40:10.616,00:40:12.535,And I need a set of eyes inside.
00:40:16.289,00:40:18.375,Excuse me?
00:40:18.416,00:40:20.793,Two weightlifters in matching black suits and earpieces?
00:40:20.835,00:40:22.212,They're hardly disguised.
00:40:22.254,00:40:24.214,"Well, it's what I have."
00:40:24.256,00:40:27.050,You don't have communication.
00:40:27.092,00:40:29.386,Tourists have cell phones.
00:40:29.427,00:40:31.512,You can't send her in there alone.
00:40:32.597,00:40:34.473,"All right, I won't."
00:40:46.194,00:40:48.947,Don't look so anxious.
00:40:50.407,00:40:52.533,"Well, maybe we're not getting along today."
00:40:54.744,00:40:57.622,Hold my hand.
00:40:57.663,00:40:59.624,But don't crush it.
00:40:59.665,00:41:02.543,Sorry.
00:41:05.546,00:41:08.925,"LANGDON: Oh, look."
00:41:08.967,00:41:11.010,That could be the demon's hole in the poem.
00:41:11.052,00:41:13.012,VITTORIA: Why are the tombs at an angle?
00:41:13.054,00:41:15.348,LANGDON: They're facing east to worship the rising sun.
00:41:15.390,00:41:17.225,But this is a Christian church.
00:41:17.267,00:41:22.981,New religions often adopt the existing customs and holidays to make conversion less of a shock.
00:41:23.022,00:41:25.191,Like the 25th of December?
00:41:25.233,00:41:30.571,"It's the pagan celebration of the Unconquered Sun, and also makes a handy date for the birth of Christ."
00:41:30.613,00:41:32.657,Let's check the recesses.
00:41:32.698,00:41:35.576,I'll go to the right.
00:41:37.787,00:41:39.789,"WOMAN: Follow me, please."
00:41:39.831,00:41:50.133,"Now, the Pantheon, which means Temple of All Gods, was originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome in 27 B.C."
00:41:50.175,00:41:55.805,Although the design of the building is usually credited to Apollodorus of Damascus...
00:41:57.265,00:41:58.724,VITTORIA: Robert!
00:42:00.893,00:42:02.312,Robert.
00:42:05.648,00:42:06.941,It's Raphael's tomb.
00:42:06.983,00:42:08.651,But it's the wrong one.
00:42:08.693,00:42:11.446,What are you talking about?
00:42:08.693,00:42:14.032,"He was moved here in 1759, a century after Diagramma was published."
00:42:14.073,00:42:15.616,Where was he originally buried?
00:42:15.616,00:42:17.035,Uh...Uh...
00:42:17.076,00:42:19.454,"Urbino, I think."
00:42:19.496,00:42:21.622,What could it possibly be?
00:42:23.875,00:42:26.794,Damn it. Santi's tomb.
00:42:26.836,00:42:29.047,It must mean a chapel that he built.
00:42:29.088,00:42:31.383,"He's not buried in it, he designed it."
00:42:31.424,00:42:33.218,"The demon's hole, it's not that oculus."
00:42:33.259,00:42:35.720,It's an undercroft.
00:42:35.761,00:42:39.015,WOMAN: Are there any questions?
00:42:39.057,00:42:45.938,Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex and an angel figure commissioned by the Catholic Church?
00:42:47.648,00:42:49.734,"I'm sorry, I-I can only think of one."
00:42:51.361,00:42:53.405,One is good.
00:42:53.446,00:42:56.115,Wrong? What do you mean?
00:42:53.446,00:42:58.159,It's the Chigi Chapel in the church of the Santa Maria del Popolo.
00:42:58.201,00:43:01.704,"It was once called the Capella della Terra, the Chapel of the Earth."
00:43:01.746,00:43:03.998,"Earth, the first element."
00:43:04.040,00:43:05.500,You were certain about the Pantheon.
00:43:05.542,00:43:06.876,We have four minutes.
00:43:10.755,00:43:12.340,Back to the Vatican?
00:43:12.382,00:43:14.426,"If you care at all about your church, you'll listen to me."
00:43:14.467,00:43:16.677,My church?
00:43:18.137,00:43:20.557,My church comforts the sick and dying.
00:43:20.681,00:43:22.016,My church feeds the hungry.
00:43:22.058,00:43:25.937,"What does your church do, Mr. Langdon?"
00:43:25.978,00:43:28.273,"That's right, you don't have one."
00:43:29.899,00:43:32.485,Take him if you want.
00:43:44.872,00:43:46.165,"All right, this makes sense."
00:43:46.207,00:43:47.542,"Look, right in front of the church."
00:43:47.584,00:43:49.919,"An obelisk, a lofty pyramid."
00:43:49.961,00:43:52.755,Egyptian symbol adopted by the Illuminati.
00:43:52.797,00:43:55.800,"If he's going to kill him, he'll do it here."
00:44:11.899,00:44:13.359,Eight o'clock.
00:44:22.368,00:44:24.287,VITTORIA: Robert.
00:44:43.014,00:44:45.350,"No, no, here."
00:45:13.919,00:45:15.963,Which one is the Chigi Chapel?
00:45:16.005,00:45:17.549,It's in one of these apses.
00:46:24.073,00:46:27.493,Pyramids in a Catholic church.
00:46:27.535,00:46:31.414,This is it.
00:46:49.223,00:46:50.391,The demon's hole.
00:46:54.520,00:46:56.272,But it's askew.
00:46:56.314,00:46:57.898,Come here.
00:47:03.696,00:47:07.032,Hand me your flashlight.
00:47:07.074,00:47:08.701,What's that?
00:48:05.007,00:48:14.600,"I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one before God I think should be elected."

00:49:00.479,00:49:03.399,They are voting for themselves to prevent a majority.
00:49:03.441,00:49:07.319,They are waiting for the preferiti to be rescued.
00:49:07.361,00:49:11.616,"Perhaps we should as well, yes?"
00:49:29.884,00:49:35.389,WOMAN: Not until the smoke is white will the College of Cardinals have chosen a new Holy Father.

00:49:58.329,00:50:00.706,No information.
00:50:00.748,00:50:03.292,Is it Raphael?
00:50:03.334,00:50:05.837,The chapel is Raphael.
00:50:05.878,00:50:08.422,But the sculptures are Bernini.
00:50:11.175,00:50:15.262,The unknown Illuminati master...
00:50:15.304,00:50:16.305,Bernini?
00:50:17.932,00:50:19.391,He worked for the Church.
00:50:19.433,00:50:22.102,Almost exclusively.
00:50:22.144,00:50:25.481,But the Illuminati were infiltrators.

01:56:03.457,01:56:05.500,"He is not a cardinal, he is a priest."

01:57:44.641,01:57:46.309,Yes?
01:57:46.351,01:57:50.355,The cardinals ask you to join them in conclave as soon as possible.
01:57:50.397,01:57:51.857,Me?

01:58:16.590,01:58:18.216,What are you doing?
01:58:18.258,01:58:21.469,Silvano's journals.
01:58:45.535,01:58:47.454,Richter said...
01:58:48.830,01:58:54.210,"His Holiness suffered from seizures, but steps were taken..."
01:58:54.252,01:58:56.546,for safety.
01:58:59.925,01:59:03.011,"Made sure he was watched, he said."
01:59:04.805,01:59:09.225,What if he was trying to give me this key?
01:59:09.267,01:59:11.770,That's the papal office.
01:59:11.812,01:59:16.858,"If the pope was worried about seizures, he must have had Richter install cameras without telling anyone."
01:59:16.900,01:59:19.694,To keep an eye on him.
01:59:21.571,01:59:23.239,Maybe it records.
01:59:34.292,01:59:36.503,"RICHTER: I read the journals, Patrick."
01:59:36.544,01:59:39.131,PATRICK: The scientist kept journals.
01:59:39.255,01:59:40.715,"Well, you figure prominently in them."
01:59:40.757,01:59:42.634,Really?
01:59:42.676,01:59:47.055,"Bentivoglio wasn't just a physicist, he was also a Catholic priest."
01:59:47.097,01:59:54.479,"And as such, he was deeply conflicted about the implications of his work and in need of spiritual guidance."
01:59:54.521,01:59:57.357,Like Galileo.
01:59:57.398,02:00:02.529,"About a month ago, he requested an audience with the Pope, but you know that."
02:00:02.570,02:00:05.991,"Because you granted the audience, and you were also present during it."
02:00:06.033,02:00:09.243,The God particle. To actually claim an act of creation.
02:00:09.285,02:00:11.245,The blasphemy.
02:00:11.287,02:00:13.665,The Holy Father didn't see it like that.
02:00:13.707,02:00:16.084,He urged him to go public.
02:00:16.126,02:00:25.426,"His Holiness thought that the discovery could actually scientifically prove the existence of a divine power, and begin to bridge the gap between science and religion."
02:00:25.468,02:00:28.221,"His work was not religious, it was sacrilegious."
02:00:28.262,02:00:33.351,But you-- You saw the Pope's position as a softening of Church law.
02:00:33.393,02:00:36.229,As an old man's weakness.
02:00:36.270,02:00:37.772,Your father's weakness.
02:00:37.814,02:00:40.400,You murdered the Vicar of Christ.
02:00:40.441,02:00:44.278,"He raised me to protect this Church, even from within."
02:00:44.320,02:00:48.282,And then-- Then you conjured up an old enemy from the past.
02:00:48.324,02:00:50.284,The Illuminati.
02:00:50.326,02:00:54.330,"You found the ancient brands in the papal vaults, and put them to use."
02:00:54.372,02:00:55.916,To spread fear.
02:00:55.957,02:00:58.334,The cardinals are men of belief.
02:00:58.376,02:01:02.214,"Right now, their belief in evil is uniting them."
02:01:02.255,02:01:05.466,The entire Catholic world will be united by this attack.
02:01:05.508,02:01:08.511,There is no attack.
02:01:08.553,02:01:13.349,You're trying to convince the cardinals they're in a war so they will choose a warrior to lead them.
02:01:13.349,02:01:14.935,We are at war.
02:01:14.976,02:01:17.187,We're weak when we should be strong.
02:01:17.229,02:01:22.692,"If science is allowed to claim the power of creation, what is left for God?"
02:01:22.734,02:01:24.402,"It didn't work, Patrick."
02:01:26.196,02:01:29.157,It isn't finished.
02:01:30.408,02:01:33.494,It's finished.
02:01:33.536,02:01:36.539,I've shown the journals to Father Simeon.
02:01:36.581,02:01:42.378,The moment the doors to the conclave open he will tell the cardinals what you've done.
02:01:42.378,02:01:44.714,I was planning on doing this alone.
02:01:47.383,02:01:49.094,Put it down.
02:01:52.097,02:01:54.682,But perhaps it's better that you're here.
02:01:54.724,02:01:55.976,Put it down.
02:01:57.685,02:01:59.562,Put it away.
02:02:12.159,02:02:15.078,Help! He's the one!
02:02:18.706,02:02:21.168,Illuminatus!
02:02:21.209,02:02:23.253,Illuminatus!
02:02:39.102,02:02:41.980,"And get the helicopter for the older cardinals, right?"
02:02:45.900,02:02:47.443,Robert?
02:02:47.443,02:02:49.696,"The brand, the symbol, could it have another meaning?"
02:03:33.489,02:03:36.243,I've been summoned by the College of Cardinals.
02:04:49.565,02:04:51.234,Gently...
02:04:51.276,02:04:52.735,but within our walls.
02:05:56.632,02:06:00.094,"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit."
02:06:51.104,02:07:00.280,WOMAN: Church sources now confirm that Camerlengo Father Patrick McKenna has died of internal injuries sustained in his heroic fall.
02:07:00.321,02:07:06.702,Crowds of the faithful are calling for the camerlengo's immediate canonization and sainthood.
02:07:06.702,02:07:13.334,The Vatican also announced the death of three of its cardinals in the fire at Santa Maria della Vittoria.
02:07:13.376,02:07:27.765,"MAN 2: --as we await the appearance of the new Holy Father Cardinal Baggia of Italy, one of the four original preferiti, who, despite terrorist attempts at disruption, seems to have been selected in one of the swiftest and smoothest conclaves in modern Church history."
02:07:35.022,02:07:36.941,Professor Langdon?
02:07:54.375,02:08:01.924,"A token of thanks from His Holiness, and from his new camerlengo."
02:08:01.966,02:08:05.428,We are grateful you saved his life.
02:08:05.470,02:08:10.766,And it's our understanding that you require this text to complete your scholarly work.
02:08:12.852,02:08:18.608,We ask only that in your last will and testament you ensure...
02:08:18.650,02:08:20.276,it finds its way home.
02:08:23.112,02:08:24.405,Of course.
02:08:24.447,02:08:32.163,"And when you write of us, and you will write of us, may I ask one thing?"
02:08:32.205,02:08:33.789,Do so gently.
02:08:36.209,02:08:37.877,I'll try.
02:08:37.918,02:08:43.508,"Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed."
02:08:43.550,02:08:46.802,"All men, including this one."
02:09:01.526,02:09:03.236,He chose the name Luke.
02:09:05.821,02:09:08.824,There's been many Marks and Johns...
02:09:10.535,02:09:12.870,never a Luke.
02:09:12.912,02:09:15.831,It's said he was a doctor.
02:09:15.831,02:09:19.919,"It's quite a message, science and faith all in one."
02:09:19.960,02:09:21.379,The world is in need of both.
02:09:24.382,02:09:27.218,You will counsel him wisely.
02:09:27.260,02:09:30.430,I am an old man.
02:09:36.310,02:09:38.229,Mr. Langdon...
02:09:43.526,02:09:47.947,Thanks be to God for sending someone to protect his Church.
02:09:52.368,02:09:55.121,"I don't believe he sent me, Father."
02:09:55.162,02:09:59.667,"Oh, my son, of course he did."
