00:04:10.250,00:04:12.086,"I have to say, your face is familiar."
00:04:12.127,00:04:14.713,- Have I drawn you before?
00:04:14.755,00:04:17.591,Of course.
00:04:17.632,00:04:18.675,You are a reporter?
00:04:18.717,00:04:21.136,I'm a journalist.
00:04:21.178,00:04:22.679,"Be patient, Snowy."
00:04:22.721,00:04:25.891,- Not much longer.
00:04:47.328,00:04:49.748,"Oh, I do beg your pardon."
00:04:49.790,00:04:52.417,Huh? What? What? Hey...
00:04:52.459,00:04:54.628,Hmm? Huh?
00:05:00.008,00:05:01.676,There.
00:05:01.718,00:05:04.596,I believe I have captured something of your likeness.
00:05:04.638,00:05:08.475,Ah. Huh. Not bad.
00:05:08.516,00:05:11.853,"What do you think, Snowy?"
00:05:11.895,00:05:13.855,Snowy!
00:05:15.023,00:05:16.733,"- There you are, sir."
00:05:16.775,00:05:20.028,"Now, where's he run off to?"
00:05:29.788,00:05:31.498,Snowy!
00:05:35.252,00:05:37.879,Where have you been? Huh?
00:05:37.921,00:05:39.923,Chasing cats again?
00:05:43.510,00:05:46.180,- Snowy... look at this.
00:05:59.609,00:06:03.071,Triple masted.
00:06:03.113,00:06:05.199,Fifty guns.
00:06:05.240,00:06:07.284,Isn't she a beauty?
00:06:07.326,00:06:09.410,"That's a very unique specimen, that is."
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.872,From an old sea captain's estate.
00:06:11.913,00:06:13.581,The Unicorn.
00:06:13.623,00:06:15.959,Unicorn.
00:06:16.001,00:06:17.794,"It's very old, that is."
00:06:17.836,00:06:20.047,- 16th century.
00:06:20.088,00:06:22.090,- Reign of Charles I.
00:06:22.132,00:06:23.842,That's what I said.
00:06:23.884,00:06:25.969,As fine a ship as ever sailed the seven seas.
00:06:26.011,00:06:29.223,"You won't find another one of these, mate."
00:06:29.264,00:06:31.099,And it's only two quid.
00:06:32.809,00:06:34.311,I'll give you a pound.
00:06:34.353,00:06:36.271,Done.
00:06:39.398,00:06:40.650,Gently does it.
00:06:40.692,00:06:42.861,Excuse me.
00:06:42.903,00:06:44.321,Here you go.
00:06:45.613,00:06:47.574,"Hey bud, how much for the boat?"
00:06:47.615,00:06:49.701,I'm sorry.
00:06:49.743,00:06:51.328,"Oh, yeah?"
00:06:51.370,00:06:53.580,"Tell me what you paid, and I'll give you double."
00:06:53.621,00:06:57.292,- Double?
00:06:57.334,00:07:00.461,"Look, kid, I'm trying to help you out."
00:07:00.503,00:07:04.423,"I don't think you realize this, but you're about to walk into a whole mess of danger."
00:07:04.465,00:07:06.218,What kind of danger?
00:07:07.386,00:07:08.929,I'm warning you.
00:07:08.970,00:07:10.805,"Get rid of the boat, and get out while you still can."
00:07:10.847,00:07:12.891,These people do not play nice.
00:07:12.933,00:07:14.893,What people?
00:07:14.935,00:07:16.019,Wonderful.
00:07:16.061,00:07:19.606,It's just wonderful.
00:07:19.647,00:07:21.608,Don't bother wrapping it.
00:07:21.649,00:07:23.568,Does anybody object if I pay by check?
00:07:23.610,00:07:26.405,"If you wanna buy it, you'll have to talk to the kid."
00:07:26.446,00:07:29.116,I see.
00:07:29.157,00:07:32.286,"Well, let the kid name his price."
00:07:32.327,00:07:33.828,Name his price?!
00:07:35.455,00:07:39.709,Ten years I've been flogging bric-a-brac and I miss name your price by one bleedin' minute!
00:07:39.751,00:07:42.379,I'm sorry. I already explained to the other gentleman.
00:07:42.421,00:07:45.590,American he was.
00:07:45.632,00:07:47.092,It's not for sale.
00:07:47.134,00:07:51.346,Then let me appeal to your better nature.
00:07:51.388,00:07:54.182,I have recently acquired Marlinspike Hall.
00:07:54.224,00:07:58.228,"This ship, I'm sure you're aware, was once part of the estate."
00:07:58.270,00:07:59.771,Of the late sea captain.
00:07:59.813,00:08:01.898,The family fell upon hard times.
00:08:01.940,00:08:03.066,Lost everything.
00:08:03.108,00:08:05.944,They've been living in a cloud of bad luck ever since.
00:08:05.986,00:08:11.366,"We are talking generations of drinking, and irrational behavior."
00:08:11.408,00:08:14.244,"I'm sorry, but as I told you before..."
00:08:14.286,00:08:16.621,...it's not for sale.
00:08:16.663,00:08:18.581,"Good day to you, sir."
00:08:22.752,00:08:25.213,That young man...
00:08:25.255,00:08:27.382,Him?
00:08:27.424,00:08:29.343,That's Tintin.
00:08:35.640,00:08:37.558,What is it about this ship?
00:08:37.600,00:08:40.437,Why has it attracted so much attention?
00:08:44.899,00:08:48.320,What secrets do you hold?
00:08:54.201,00:08:55.618,Ah.
00:08:55.660,00:08:58.746,Where is that magnifying glass?
00:09:02.209,00:09:04.085,I could have sworn it was...
00:09:04.127,00:09:07.339,No.
00:09:09.590,00:09:14.888,Over here?
00:09:14.929,00:09:17.891,"Snowy, you haven't seen the, uh...?"
00:09:17.932,00:09:19.309,Where is it?
00:09:23.897,00:09:26.233,Thank you.
00:09:29.027,00:09:31.905,"No, Snowy!"
00:09:49.464,00:09:51.383,Look what you did.
00:09:51.425,00:09:53.593,You broke it!
00:09:53.634,00:09:56.471,- Bad dog!
00:10:02.852,00:10:05.522,Something happened on this ship.
00:10:07.274,00:10:10.235,We're going to the one place that could have the answer.
00:10:10.277,00:10:12.529,"- Come on, Snowy."
00:10:34.634,00:10:36.970,Here it is.
00:10:37.011,00:10:41.433,"Sir Francis Haddock of Marlinspike Hall, the last captain of the ill-fated Unicorn..."
00:10:41.475,00:10:46.854,The ship set sail from Barbados in 1676 on one of the most ruinous voyages in maritime history.
00:10:46.896,00:10:49.274,The ship never reached destination...
00:10:49.316,00:10:51.067,Attacked by pirates...
00:10:51.109,00:10:53.820,"All hands lost, except for one survivor."
00:10:53.861,00:10:59.033,"When Sir Francis was rescued and returned home, he was convinced his name had been cursed."
00:10:59.075,00:11:07.167,"The Unicorn's manifest stated it was carrying a cargo of rum and tobacco bound for Europe, but it was long claimed the ship was carrying a secret cargo."
00:11:09.586,00:11:13.089,"What was the ship carrying, Snowy?"
00:11:13.131,00:11:18.178,Historians have tried and failed to discover what happened on that fatal voyage...
00:11:18.219,00:11:20.930,But Sir Francis's last words...
00:11:22.265,00:11:54.339,"'Only a true Haddock will discover the secret of the Unicorn.' - I've missed something, Snowy."
00:11:54.381,00:11:56.883,We need to take a closer look at that model.
00:12:08.936,00:12:11.064,Of course it's gone.
00:12:11.105,00:12:13.774,How could I be so stupid?
00:12:35.004,00:12:37.674,- How'd you do that?
00:12:41.511,00:12:43.346,Clever boy.
00:13:00.238,00:13:02.532,A coat of arms.
00:13:02.574,00:13:05.076,Why does that look familiar?
00:13:05.118,00:13:07.537,Hang on a minute.
00:13:07.579,00:13:09.706,That fish.
00:13:09.748,00:13:11.625,It's a haddock.
00:13:11.666,00:13:14.877,Of course. Marlinspike Hall is the old Haddock estate.
00:13:14.919,00:13:17.213,- Sn...
00:13:17.255,00:13:18.673,- Snowy.
00:13:45.742,00:13:47.786,"Well done, Snowy."
00:13:47.826,00:13:49.954,Good boy.
00:14:43.924,00:14:46.010,"Well, well, well."
00:14:46.052,00:14:48.095,It seems we've caught our thief.
00:14:58.481,00:15:00.650,Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
00:15:00.692,00:15:03.903,I see you let yourself in.
00:15:03.944,00:15:05.488,I came to retrieve my property.
00:15:05.530,00:15:07.948,I'm sorry.
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.701,"Oh, I think you do."
00:15:09.743,00:15:12.829,This ship was stolen from my apartment less than an hour ago.
00:15:12.871,00:15:14.664,"I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr. Tintin."
00:15:14.706,00:15:16.165,There's no mistake.
00:15:16.207,00:15:19.043,- It belongs to me.
00:15:21.421,00:15:23.130,Of course I'm sure.
00:15:23.172,00:15:27.635,"I took it home, I put it in on the cabinet in the living room, and then Snowy chased the cat and knocked it over, and it..."
00:15:27.677,00:15:31.305,- ...fell.
00:15:32.891,00:15:35.226,This isn't my ship.
00:15:35.268,00:15:37.520,"No, indeed."
00:15:37.562,00:15:38.897,I'm sorry.
00:15:38.938,00:15:40.147,It looks identical.
00:15:40.189,00:15:41.524,"Well, looks can be deceiving."
00:15:41.566,00:15:43.526,"Yes, indeed."
00:15:43.568,00:15:45.737,But I don't understand.
00:15:45.779,00:15:49.490,Why did Sir Francis make two ships exactly alike?
00:15:49.532,00:15:51.826,And you have one already.
00:15:51.868,00:15:54.036,Why do you want another?
00:15:54.078,00:15:57.457,What is it about this model that would cause someone to steal it?
00:15:57.498,00:16:01.168,Goodness me.
00:16:01.210,00:16:02.837,It's my job.
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.715,There could be a story here.
00:16:05.757,00:16:07.300,"Well, it's no great mystery."
00:16:07.341,00:16:11.596,"Sir Francis Haddock was a drunkard, and a hopeless reprobate."
00:16:09.176,00:16:14.808,"He was doomed to fail, and he bequeathed that failure to his sons."
00:16:14.849,00:16:16.851,So it's true.
00:16:16.893,00:16:19.270,The Haddock line is cursed.
00:16:21.105,00:16:22.774,What else have you found out?
00:16:22.816,00:16:24.358,What is there to find?
00:16:24.400,00:16:27.570,That depends what you're looking for.
00:16:27.612,00:16:29.656,I'm looking for answers...
00:16:29.697,00:16:31.198,...Mr. Sakharine.
00:16:31.240,00:16:34.076,You're looking in the wrong place.
00:16:34.118,00:16:36.036,It's late.
00:16:36.078,00:16:38.623,I think you should go home.
00:16:38.665,00:16:40.625,"This way, sir."
00:16:54.973,00:16:56.766,"It's a pity, sir."
00:16:56.808,00:16:58.685,I'm sorry?
00:16:58.726,00:17:01.187,"That the mast broke on your model ship, sir."
00:17:01.228,00:17:04.023,I hope you found all the pieces.
00:17:04.064,00:17:05.650,Things are so easily lost.
00:17:05.692,00:17:08.486,"Nestor, where are you?"
00:17:08.528,00:17:11.197,"Good night, sir."
00:17:14.492,00:17:17.244,Some things are easily lost.
00:17:18.371,00:17:20.999,"What did he mean by that, Snowy?"
00:17:21.040,00:17:23.710,What was he trying to tell me?
00:17:23.751,00:17:26.337,Some things are easily lost.
00:17:40.142,00:17:41.561,Great snakes!
00:17:48.526,00:17:50.862,"What is it, Snowy?"
00:18:08.128,00:18:10.214,What's this?
00:18:10.256,00:18:11.883,Aha!
00:18:11.925,00:18:14.260,This was in the mast.
00:18:21.100,00:18:23.352,"Good boy, Snowy."
00:18:27.231,00:18:29.067,Three brothers joined.
00:18:29.108,00:18:31.986,Three Unicorns in company...
00:18:32.028,00:18:35.281,Sailing in the noonday sun will speak.
00:18:35.322,00:18:38.659,For it is from the light...
00:18:35.322,00:18:41.913,"That light will dawn, And then shine forth the Eagle's Cross."
00:18:44.082,00:18:46.208,What are these markings?
00:18:46.250,00:18:49.963,Some kind of secret language... or code?
00:18:50.004,00:18:51.756,It makes no sense.
00:18:51.798,00:18:54.216,But it does explain why they ransacked the flat.
00:18:54.258,00:18:57.386,"They were looking for this, and they didn't find it."
00:18:57.428,00:18:59.597,Which means...
00:19:01.015,00:19:04.060,- They'll be back.
00:19:04.102,00:19:06.270,"No, I don't know where he is, dearie."
00:19:06.312,00:19:08.022,I think he's gone out.
00:19:08.064,00:19:14.361,"And anyway, it's after dark, and Mr. Tintin is most particular about not admitting visitors after bedtime."
00:19:14.403,00:19:16.948,I have to go back to my cocoa.
00:19:16.990,00:19:20.367,I've got a very good book and a cup of cocoa.
00:19:20.409,00:19:22.161,It's really lovely.
00:19:22.202,00:19:25.372,"Thank you, Mrs. Finch."
00:19:28.250,00:19:31.545,Open the door.
00:19:31.587,00:19:33.756,What do you want?
00:19:33.798,00:19:35.508,"Look, the game is up."
00:19:35.549,00:19:38.052,He's gonna be back.
00:19:35.549,00:19:41.764,"Now, I know he wanted those boats, but I swear to God, I never thought he'd kill anyone over it."
00:19:41.806,00:19:44.475,Who?
00:19:44.517,00:19:46.936,I'm trying to tell you that your life is in danger.
00:19:46.978,00:19:48.270,Answer me! Who?
00:20:08.499,00:20:12.045,Mrs. Finch! A man's been shot on our doorstep!
00:20:12.086,00:20:13.587,Not again.
00:20:13.629,00:20:15.173,Call an ambulance!
00:20:18.134,00:20:20.260,"No, Snowy!"
00:20:33.107,00:20:35.026,Can you hear me?
00:20:35.068,00:20:36.485,Can you?
00:20:45.703,00:20:48.414,The victim's name was Barnaby Dawes.
00:20:48.455,00:20:53.002,"He was one of the top agents at Interpol, but we haven't got a clue what he was working on."
00:20:53.044,00:20:55.755,"Quite right, Thompson."
00:20:55.796,00:20:57.631,Interpol doesn't have any other leads?
00:20:57.673,00:21:00.009,"Steady on, Tintin."
00:21:00.051,00:21:02.261,Police work's not all glamour and guns.
00:21:02.302,00:21:03.846,There's an awful lot of filing.
00:21:03.888,00:21:05.305,"Well, I might have something for you."
00:21:05.347,00:21:10.436,"Before he lost consciousness, Dawes tried to tell me something, and I think he was spelling out a word."
00:21:10.477,00:21:12.730,B-O-U...
00:21:12.772,00:21:15.733,...D-J-A-N.
00:21:17.944,00:21:19.403,Karaboudjan.
00:21:19.445,00:21:20.863,Karaboudjan?
00:21:20.905,00:21:22.782,Does that mean anything to you?
00:21:22.823,00:21:24.283,Great Scotland Yard!
00:21:24.324,00:21:26.202,- That's extraordinary.
00:21:26.244,00:21:28.537,Worthington's have a half-price sale on bowler hats.
00:21:28.579,00:21:31.124,"Really, Thomson?"
00:21:31.165,00:21:32.959,- Great Scotland Yard!
00:21:33.000,00:21:34.627,"Canes are half-price, too."
00:21:34.668,00:21:36.503,Are you going to take charge of this evidence?
00:21:36.545,00:21:38.338,Positively.
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.133,The evidence is safe with us.
00:21:42.051,00:21:44.220,Thomson?
00:21:44.262,00:21:46.264,"Well, I'm already downstairs."
00:21:46.305,00:21:48.224,Do try to keep up.
00:21:49.600,00:21:50.559,Wait!
00:21:50.601,00:21:52.145,- Huh?
00:21:52.186,00:21:54.897,"Good heavens, Thomson!"
00:21:54.939,00:21:57.150,"Sorry, Thompson."
00:21:57.191,00:21:58.484,"Ah, yes."
00:21:58.525,00:22:00.194,Our light-fingered larcenist.
00:22:00.236,00:22:01.279,What?
00:22:01.320,00:22:02.404,- The pickpocket.
00:22:02.446,00:22:04.073,He has no idea what's coming.
00:22:04.115,00:22:05.741,"Go on, Tintin."
00:22:05.783,00:22:08.535,Take my wallet.
00:22:10.370,00:22:13.291,"Yes, industrial strength elastic."
00:22:13.332,00:22:15.459,Very resourceful.
00:22:15.501,00:22:17.253,On the contrary.
00:22:17.295,00:22:19.172,It was childishly simple.
00:22:19.213,00:22:21.257,Simply childish.
00:22:22.300,00:22:24.551,Gentlemen.
00:22:24.593,00:22:27.554,he's miles away by now.
00:22:27.596,00:22:29.849,referring to the pickpocket.
00:22:29.890,00:22:33.686,knowing we're just a few steps behind him.
00:22:33.727,00:22:36.730,"Snowy? What is it, boy?"
00:22:36.772,00:22:38.398,I don't suppose you'd fancy a cup of tea?
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.985,You're quite mistaken.
00:22:41.027,00:22:43.654,- My treat.
00:22:43.696,00:22:46.406,- Huh?
00:22:46.448,00:22:49.576,Stop! In the name of the law!
00:22:50.703,00:22:52.205,Got you!
00:22:55.833,00:22:57.501,What's going on down there?
00:22:57.543,00:22:59.086,"Come on, Snowy."
00:23:00.378,00:23:02.380,I do beg your pardon.
00:23:02.422,00:23:04.842,"- Sorry, sir."
00:23:04.884,00:23:06.302,He's getting away!
00:23:06.344,00:23:08.304,My wallet.
00:23:08.346,00:23:10.681,It's gone.
00:23:13.100,00:23:14.143,Come on!
00:23:14.185,00:23:15.644,"Snowy, after him!"
00:23:15.686,00:23:17.063,Stop! Wait!
00:23:29.367,00:23:31.827,- Gotcha!
00:23:31.869,00:23:34.872,I've lost him.
00:23:34.914,00:23:36.874,You must find my wallet.
00:23:36.916,00:23:39.335,- I have to get it back.
00:23:39.377,00:23:43.172,Leave it to the professionals.
00:23:43.214,00:23:45.258,We've lost the scroll.
00:23:45.299,00:23:47.301,But we haven't lost the story.
00:23:47.343,00:23:49.136,Karaboudjan.
00:23:49.178,00:23:51.013,It's an Armenian word.
00:23:51.055,00:23:54.725,- What was Barnaby Dawes trying to tell us when he said our lives were in danger?
00:23:54.767,00:23:56.227,Mr. Tin... tin?
00:23:56.269,00:23:58.145,- Yes?
00:23:58.187,00:23:59.730,But I didn't order anything.
00:23:59.772,00:24:02.691,That's because it's you that's getting delivered.
00:24:06.362,00:24:09.740,"Quick, get him in the van!"
00:24:09.782,00:24:14.661,"Ah! Get off me, you confounded mutt!"
00:24:46.860,00:24:48.612,Get him off!
00:24:50.156,00:24:52.490,"Shake him off, then run him over!"
00:25:24.648,00:25:28.235,- Put your back into it.
00:25:37.244,00:25:39.537,I want this on the starboard side.
00:25:46.086,00:25:47.505,- They're not here.
00:25:47.545,00:25:49.631,- Look your side.
00:25:49.673,00:25:51.425,- Nothing.
00:25:51.467,00:25:53.344,"No, I've looked in this one already."
00:25:53.386,00:25:55.429,"Well, have a look in his socks."
00:25:57.223,00:25:59.850,- Have you found it?
00:25:59.892,00:26:01.643,"It's not on him, boss."
00:26:01.685,00:26:03.062,Then where is it?
00:26:03.103,00:26:04.897,Where's what?
00:26:04.938,00:26:06.399,"Oh, I am tired of your games."
00:26:06.440,00:26:08.275,The scroll from the Unicorn.
00:26:08.317,00:26:11.362,A piece of paper like this.
00:26:11.404,00:26:13.030,You mean the poem?
00:26:13.072,00:26:15.032,Yes.
00:26:15.074,00:26:17.201,The poem written in Old English?
00:26:17.243,00:26:18.869,Yes.
00:26:18.911,00:26:21.414,- It was inside a cylinder.
00:26:21.455,00:26:22.540,Concealed in the mast.
00:26:22.580,00:26:24.250,Yes.
00:26:25.583,00:26:27.127,I don't have it.
00:26:28.379,00:26:30.423,You know the value of that scroll.
00:26:30.464,00:26:32.925,Why else would you take it?
00:26:32.966,00:26:35.719,"Two ships, two scrolls..."
00:26:35.761,00:26:37.221,Both part of a puzzle.
00:26:37.263,00:26:39.723,You have one.
00:26:39.765,00:26:41.599,But that's not it.
00:26:41.641,00:26:43.436,There's something else.
00:26:43.477,00:26:45.771,I will find it...
00:26:45.812,00:26:49.816,...with or without your help.
00:26:49.858,00:26:53.446,You need to think about exactly how useful you are to me.
00:26:57.657,00:26:59.243,We'll deal with him on the way.
00:26:59.285,00:27:01.619,"- Aye, aye, sir."
00:27:07.876,00:27:10.712,- Snowy!
00:27:11.964,00:27:13.299,"It's good to see you, too."
00:27:13.340,00:27:15.675,See if you can chew through these ropes.
00:27:20.514,00:27:22.224,He must have the scroll.
00:27:22.266,00:27:24.101,"The question is, what has he done with it?"
00:27:24.143,00:27:26.186,"him all over, boss."
00:27:26.228,00:27:28.814,to go back down there and make him talk.
00:27:28.855,00:27:31.525,Break every bone in his body if you have to.
00:27:31.567,00:27:33.860,- That's nasty.
00:27:33.902,00:27:35.529,You know what we're playing for.
00:27:35.571,00:27:37.156,Just do it!
00:27:37.197,00:27:39.116,Mr. Sakharine!
00:27:39.158,00:27:41.076,It's a disaster!
00:27:41.118,00:27:42.828,- What?
00:27:42.869,00:27:44.830,He's accusing you of mutiny.
00:27:44.871,00:27:47.040,He says you turned the crew against him.
00:27:47.082,00:27:48.792,Sounds like he's sobered up again.
00:27:48.834,00:27:51.003,"Well, don't just stand there."
00:27:51.044,00:27:53.172,"- Si, senor."
00:28:01.221,00:28:03.432,- Whoa! OK.
00:28:21.408,00:28:22.660,Jiggle it a bit.
00:28:22.700,00:28:24.911,- Jiggle?
00:28:26.497,00:28:27.789,What are you doing?
00:28:27.831,00:28:29.041,Get off.
00:28:29.082,00:28:30.584,"It's not stuck, you idiot."
00:28:30.626,00:28:32.545,He's bolted it from the inside.
00:28:32.586,00:28:35.422,"You wanna play like that then, do you, Tintin?"
00:28:35.464,00:28:37.090,Get the TNT.
00:28:37.132,00:28:39.343,- Broken crates.
00:28:39.385,00:28:41.595,"Rope, champagne."
00:28:41.637,00:28:44.056,"What else do we have, Snowy?"
00:28:44.097,00:28:47.142,There are other ways to open this door.
00:28:47.184,00:28:50.729,They'll be swabbing the decks with your innards when we're done with you.
00:28:55.442,00:28:57.194,Give it here.
00:29:21.677,00:29:23.803,- Don't move.
00:29:29.393,00:29:31.978,- Let's go!
00:29:32.020,00:29:33.230,Let me have him!
00:29:33.272,00:29:35.649,He's got a big shooter!
00:29:35.691,00:29:38.818,He got me.
00:29:41.947,00:29:43.907,Hold your fire.
00:29:49.996,00:29:51.582,He ain't here.
00:29:51.624,00:29:53.375,He's vanished.
00:29:54.585,00:29:56.128,He's hiding.
00:29:56.169,00:29:57.463,Search the ship!
00:29:57.504,00:29:59.506,Quickly!
00:30:09.808,00:30:13.853,A giant rat of Sumatra!
00:30:13.895,00:30:19.067,"Aha! So you thought you could sneak in behind me and catch me with my trousers down, huh?"
00:30:19.109,00:30:22.529,"I'd rather you kept your trousers on, - if it's all the same to you."
00:30:22.571,00:30:24.239,- You're one of them!
00:30:24.281,00:30:26.199,They sent you here to kill me!
00:30:26.241,00:30:27.743,"Look, I don't know who you are!"
00:30:27.785,00:30:29.536,That's how he's planned to bump me off.
00:30:29.578,00:30:32.038,Murdered in my bed by a baby-faced assassin!
00:30:34.500,00:30:36.710,Assassin?
00:30:36.752,00:30:39.129,I was kidnapped by a gang of thugs.
00:30:41.173,00:30:43.550,The filthy swine.
00:30:43.592,00:30:46.261,He's turned the whole crew against me!
00:30:46.303,00:30:47.763,Who?
00:30:47.805,00:30:49.889,A sour-faced man with a sugary name.
00:30:49.931,00:30:52.058,He's bought them all off.
00:30:52.100,00:30:53.852,Sakharine!
00:30:53.893,00:30:58.064,Nobody takes my ship!
00:30:58.106,00:31:00.150,- You're the captain?
00:31:00.192,00:31:02.653,- Who else could I be?
00:31:02.695,00:31:10.869,"I've been locked in this room for days, with only whiskey to sustain my mortal soul."
00:31:14.289,00:31:16.291,Oh.
00:31:16.333,00:31:18.669,"Well, I assumed it was locked."
00:31:18.711,00:31:20.086,"Well, it's not."
00:31:20.128,00:31:21.672,"Now, you must excuse me."
00:31:21.714,00:31:23.549,"If they find me here, they'll kill me."
00:31:23.590,00:31:24.883,I have to keep moving.
00:31:24.924,00:31:27.636,Try and find my way off this drunken tub.
00:31:27.678,00:31:29.596,Tub? Tub?!
00:31:34.309,00:31:35.977,Tub?
00:31:38.938,00:31:41.233,Tub?!
00:31:43.402,00:31:45.863,- Thanks.
00:31:48.114,00:31:49.491,"I'm Tintin, by the way."
00:31:49.533,00:31:51.577,"Haddock, Archibald Haddock."
00:31:51.618,00:31:54.204,There's a longboat up on deck. Follow me.
00:31:54.246,00:31:55.664,Hang on a second.
00:31:55.706,00:31:57.207,Did you say Haddock?
00:31:57.249,00:32:00.126,How could you let them escape?
00:32:00.168,00:32:02.254,Find them.
00:32:02.295,00:32:03.714,Don't worry.
00:32:03.756,00:32:05.173,No.
00:32:05.215,00:32:07.885,You can kill the boy.
00:32:07.926,00:32:10.345,He's just a hopeless old soak!
00:32:10.387,00:32:12.389,We should've killed him long since.
00:32:12.431,00:32:20.272,"You think it's an accident that I chose Haddock's ship, Haddock's crew, Haddock's treacherous first mate?"
00:32:20.313,00:32:23.650,Nothing is an accident.
00:32:29.281,00:32:32.659,"We go back a long way, Captain Haddock and I."
00:32:32.701,00:32:35.746,We've unfinished business.
00:32:35.788,00:32:40.709,"And this time, I'm going to make him pay."
00:32:40.751,00:32:43.962,We have to reach a locked door at the end of this corridor.
00:32:44.003,00:32:45.631,This is gonna be tricky.
00:32:45.672,00:32:49.927,"You wouldn't happen to be related to the Haddocks - of Marlinspike Hall, would you?"
00:32:49.968,00:32:54.640,"It's for a story I've been working on, an old shipwreck that happened off the coast of Barbados."
00:32:54.681,00:32:56.224,A man o'war.
00:32:56.266,00:32:58.560,- Fifty guns.
00:33:00.019,00:33:01.480,What do you know of the Unicorn?
00:33:01.521,00:33:03.941,Not a lot. That's why I'm asking you.
00:33:04.023,00:33:06.819,The secret of that ship is known only to my family.
00:33:06.860,00:33:09.988,It's been passed down from generation to generation.
00:33:10.029,00:33:15.911,"My granddaddy himself, with his dying breath, told me the tale."
00:33:15.953,00:33:17.496,And?
00:33:17.537,00:33:19.581,Gone.
00:33:19.623,00:33:21.333,What do you mean gone?
00:33:21.374,00:33:24.837,"I was so upset when he kicked the bucket, I had no choice but to drown my sorrows."
00:33:24.878,00:33:26.797,"When I woke up in the morning, it was gone."
00:33:26.839,00:33:28.340,Forgotten it all.
00:33:28.381,00:33:30.133,- Everything?
00:33:30.175,00:33:32.010,Is there somebody else in your family?
00:33:32.051,00:33:33.261,Maybe they would know.
00:33:33.303,00:33:34.638,Sir Francis had three sons.
00:33:34.680,00:33:36.598,All but my bloodline failed.
00:33:36.640,00:33:40.018,I am the last of the Haddocks.
00:33:40.059,00:33:41.645,Did you say three sons?
00:33:43.689,00:33:46.525,for man who find Haddock.
00:33:46.566,00:33:49.486,Hope I find him first.
00:33:49.528,00:33:53.281,- What's that?
00:33:57.369,00:33:58.954,there's nothing there.
00:34:01.206,00:34:02.916,I know what Sakharine's looking for.
00:34:02.958,00:34:04.626,What you raving on about?
00:34:04.668,00:34:06.628,It was written on the scroll.
00:34:06.670,00:34:08.839,Three brothers joined...
00:34:08.881,00:34:12.425,"Three Unicorns in company, sailing in the noonday sun will speak."
00:34:12.467,00:34:13.969,Really?
00:34:14.011,00:34:16.596,Sir Francis didn't make two models of the Unicorn.
00:34:16.638,00:34:18.431,He made three.
00:34:18.473,00:34:21.393,Three ships for three sons.
00:34:21.434,00:34:23.603,Excellent.
00:34:25.313,00:34:28.650,Sakharine's after the third model ship.
00:34:28.692,00:34:29.943,Barnacles!
00:34:29.985,00:34:31.778,Someone's locked the door.
00:34:31.820,00:34:32.779,"Well, is there a key?"
00:34:32.821,00:34:35.574,A key? Ah.
00:34:37.158,00:34:40.203,"Yes, now that would be the problem."
00:34:43.749,00:34:47.210,- Mr. Jaggerman.
00:34:47.252,00:34:49.128,Top bunk in the center.
00:34:49.170,00:34:51.715,Keeper of the keys.
00:34:51.757,00:34:55.677,He's a restless sleeper on account of the tragic loss of his eyelids.
00:34:55.719,00:34:57.429,- He lost his eyelids?
00:34:57.470,00:34:59.723,"Now, that was a card game to remember."
00:35:01.433,00:35:03.894,You really had to be there.
00:35:03.936,00:35:06.312,"I'd do this myself, Tintin, but..."
00:35:06.354,00:35:09.357,...you've a lighter tread and less chance of waking the boys.
00:35:09.399,00:35:11.317,this is a good idea?
00:35:11.359,00:35:13.319,to worry about.
00:35:13.361,00:35:15.614,Provided they all stay asleep.
00:35:15.655,00:35:18.784,I wouldn't get too close to Mr. Hobbs.
00:35:18.825,00:35:21.202,He's very handy with the razor.
00:35:23.956,00:35:27.208,And I'd steer clear of Mr. Gitch.
00:35:30.045,00:35:34.591,Sacked as a shepherd on account of his animal husbandry.
00:36:00.533,00:36:02.828,Not the sandwich.
00:36:02.869,00:36:05.413,The keys.
00:36:23.306,00:36:25.433,"You're a brave lad, Tintin."
00:36:25.475,00:36:27.310,My heart was in my mouth.
00:36:27.352,00:36:29.104,Don't mind telling you.
00:36:30.689,00:36:32.691,"That is, if it was my heart."
00:36:32.732,00:36:34.693,"Judging by my stomach, it could have been anything."
00:36:34.734,00:36:36.945,"Hurry up, Captain!"
00:36:36.987,00:36:38.738,Bingo!
00:36:38.780,00:36:40.991,"Just the necessities, of course."
00:36:47.873,00:36:50.375,To the lifeboats.
00:36:54.295,00:36:55.881,Put your back into it!
00:36:55.922,00:36:57.716,"Hold here there, steady!"
00:36:57.757,00:37:00.426,"- Any sign of him, Jumbo?"
00:37:00.468,00:37:02.762,Watch yourself. The boss says he's a handful.
00:37:06.058,00:37:09.227,- Shh.
00:37:14.858,00:37:16.693,Come on.
00:37:36.171,00:37:37.881,It's Allan.
00:37:37.923,00:37:39.382,Is that the bridge?
00:37:39.424,00:37:41.426,"Aye, on the other side of the radio room."
00:37:41.467,00:37:43.469,Radio room?
00:37:43.511,00:37:44.804,"Wait here, Captain."
00:37:44.846,00:37:47.182,Sound the alarm if anyone comes.
00:37:47.224,00:37:49.350,"Careful, Tintin."
00:37:50.894,00:37:52.520,I can't see a thing.
00:37:52.562,00:37:54.647,and find that kid!
00:37:54.689,00:37:56.900,sign on for this.
00:37:56.942,00:37:58.443,searching!
00:37:58.484,00:38:00.319,"Message just come through, boss."
00:38:01.696,00:38:03.615,The Milanese Nightingale has landed.
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.992,Waiting in the wings for action.
00:38:06.034,00:38:08.453,Milanese Nightingale?
00:38:08.494,00:38:10.538,Now pray this cheers him up.
00:38:26.888,00:38:28.181,Bagghar.
00:38:28.223,00:38:30.642,What's this?
00:38:30.683,00:38:34.813,The sultanate of Bagghar...
00:38:34.854,00:38:43.155,"...ruled over by Sheik Omar Ben Salaad, whose love of music and culture is matched only by his love of..."
00:38:45.364,00:38:46.324,Great snakes!
00:38:52.122,00:38:55.625,Bagghar.
00:38:55.667,00:38:57.794,The Port of Bagghar.
00:38:57.836,00:39:00.088,Morocco.
00:39:07.929,00:39:10.098,Tintin?
00:39:11.516,00:39:14.352,Hey!
00:39:17.438,00:39:20.317,- Let that be a lesson to you.
00:39:20.358,00:39:22.735,Help me!
00:39:32.287,00:39:33.621,- In here! He's in here!
00:39:38.501,00:39:40.212,"Here, by the lifeboats!"
00:39:40.253,00:39:43.506,Get out of the way!
00:39:43.548,00:39:45.258,Oy!
00:39:51.348,00:39:53.641,"Quick, he's here!"
00:39:59.272,00:40:02.275,Why you little...
00:40:02.317,00:40:03.985,Huh?
00:40:20.919,00:40:23.296,- He's up there!
00:40:27.967,00:40:29.719,I see him now!
00:40:35.516,00:40:37.060,Don't let them get away!
00:40:41.522,00:40:43.983,Help me!
00:40:49.697,00:40:51.657,- Turn this ship around!
00:40:57.872,00:41:00.333,"Captain, get down."
00:41:03.295,00:41:04.421,There he is!
00:41:04.462,00:41:07.299,Get out of the way!
00:41:10.385,00:41:13.179,Now! Full ahead!
00:41:18.810,00:41:20.312,Got you now.
00:41:20.353,00:41:23.398,Stay down.
00:41:34.033,00:41:35.452,"Look, there they are!"
00:41:47.464,00:41:48.923,Idiots!
00:41:48.965,00:41:50.758,You idiots!
00:41:50.800,00:41:53.052,"We killed 'em, boss, like you wanted."
00:41:53.094,00:41:55.638,"No, not like I wanted."
00:41:55.680,00:41:57.556,I needed Haddock alive!
00:41:57.598,00:41:59.058,"Wait a minute, boss!"
00:41:59.100,00:42:00.726,There are two boats missing!
00:42:00.768,00:42:04.063,So that one must have been a decoy.
00:42:11.529,00:42:13.365,They're on to us...
00:42:13.406,00:42:15.574,...and our destination.
00:42:15.616,00:42:17.202,Find them!
00:42:17.243,00:42:19.996,Make absolutely certain they never reach Bagghar.
00:42:20.038,00:42:22.081,"Yes, boss."
00:42:35.470,00:42:37.722,We have to get to Bagghar ahead of Sakharine.
00:42:37.763,00:42:39.598,"I know, I know."
00:42:39.640,00:42:41.309,Why?
00:42:41.351,00:42:43.853,Because he has the third model ship.
00:42:43.895,00:42:46.064,How do you know?
00:42:46.105,00:42:52.362,"The Sheik collects old ships, and this is the prize of his collection."
00:42:54.072,00:42:57.450,Blistering blue barnacles!
00:42:57.492,00:42:59.202,"Captain, do you see the distortion around the model?"
00:42:59.244,00:43:00.495,"Uh-huh, aye."
00:43:00.537,00:43:04.249,It means that Ben Salaad exhibits it in a bulletproof glass case in his palace.
00:43:04.290,00:43:07.043,And Sakharine is going there to steal it.
00:43:07.085,00:43:08.669,"Yes, he has a secret weapon."
00:43:08.711,00:43:10.296,The Milanese Nightingale.
00:43:10.338,00:43:13.925,"But that won't be enough to solve the mystery, and that is why Sakharine needs you."
00:43:13.966,00:43:16.010,That's why he made you his prisoner.
00:43:16.052,00:43:19.805,There is something he needs you to remember.
00:43:19.847,00:43:23.226,I don't follow you.
00:43:24.561,00:43:25.770,I read it in a book.
00:43:25.811,00:43:30.358,That only a true Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn.
00:43:35.238,00:43:37.949,I don't remember anything about anything.
00:43:37.990,00:43:39.909,But you must know about your ancestors.
00:43:39.951,00:43:41.411,Sir Francis...
00:43:41.453,00:43:42.703,My memory is not what it used to be.
00:43:42.745,00:43:43.955,What did it use to be?
00:43:43.996,00:43:46.082,- I've forgotten.
00:43:46.124,00:43:47.750,Captain.
00:43:47.792,00:43:50.002,Can you get us to Bagghar?
00:43:50.044,00:43:54.257,What sort of a stupid question is that?
00:43:54.299,00:43:55.967,Give me those oars!
00:43:56.008,00:43:58.428,"I'll show you some real seamanship, laddie."
00:43:58.470,00:44:04.725,I'll not be doubted by some pipsqueak tuft of ginger and his irritating dog.
00:44:04.767,00:44:08.104,I am master and commander of the seas.
00:44:10.440,00:44:14.486,I know these waters better than the warts on my mother's face.
00:44:16.779,00:44:18.323,Look at the pair of them.
00:44:18.364,00:44:19.616,Fast asleep.
00:44:19.657,00:44:22.076,Typical landlubbers.
00:44:22.118,00:44:24.329,No stamina these days.
00:44:24.370,00:44:26.164,Never mind.
00:44:26.205,00:44:28.625,"I'll get you there, Tintin."
00:44:44.182,00:44:46.225,"Look, Thompson."
00:44:46.267,00:44:49.812,- Uh-huh.
00:44:59.155,00:45:00.657,- Mr. Silk?
00:45:00.697,00:45:02.074,Yes?
00:45:02.116,00:45:03.826,- My name is Thompson.
00:45:03.868,00:45:06.371,We're police officers.
00:45:06.412,00:45:08.122,Oh.
00:45:08.164,00:45:10.291,"Oh, crumbs."
00:45:11.792,00:45:13.378,- Oh!
00:45:14.962,00:45:16.339,"Dear, oh dear, oh dear."
00:45:16.381,00:45:18.341,Poor fellow.
00:45:18.383,00:45:20.885,Are you all right?
00:45:20.926,00:45:23.012,"- Are you all right, sir?"
00:45:23.054,00:45:26.182,"- Thank you, very kind."
00:45:26.224,00:45:27.684,"No, no, you see..."
00:45:27.724,00:45:30.936,"Yesterday, we very nearly caught the pickpocket who's been terrorizing the town."
00:45:30.978,00:45:33.147,- Pickpocket?
00:45:30.978,00:45:35.024,"- We pulled his jacket off, and inside we found a wallet."
00:45:35.066,00:45:37.402,A wallet with your name and address.
00:45:37.443,00:45:39.153,- That's my wallet.
00:45:39.195,00:45:41.280,"- No no, that's my wallet."
00:45:41.322,00:45:42.615,We didn't mean to startle you.
00:45:42.657,00:45:44.116,Let us help you into your apartment.
00:45:44.158,00:45:45.826,- There you go.
00:45:45.868,00:45:47.579,No need to come in.
00:45:47.620,00:45:50.206,"- No, but we insist."
00:45:50.248,00:45:51.457,It's the least we can do.
00:45:51.499,00:45:54.877,"- Oh, thank you."
00:45:54.919,00:45:57.213,Good grief!
00:45:57.255,00:45:59.591,It's my... collection?
00:45:59.632,00:46:01.342,What a lot of wallets.
00:46:01.384,00:46:02.635,I can't help it.
00:46:02.677,00:46:06.556,"It started with coin purses, and sort of went on from there, really."
00:46:06.598,00:46:08.099,You want to be careful.
00:46:08.140,00:46:10.643,Haven't you heard?
00:46:10.685,00:46:12.228,"Yes, he'd love this."
00:46:12.270,00:46:14.188,"What do you mean, pickpocket?"
00:46:14.230,00:46:15.772,A master criminal.
00:46:15.814,00:46:19.694,"A bag-snatching, purse-pilfering, wallet-lifting sneak thief."
00:46:19.736,00:46:21.195,I'm not a bad person.
00:46:21.237,00:46:23.906,I'm a kleptomaniac.
00:46:23.948,00:46:24.949,A what?
00:46:24.990,00:46:27.076,It's a fear of open spaces.
00:46:27.118,00:46:29.786,Poor man. No wonder he keeps his wallets in the living room.
00:46:29.828,00:46:33.708,Wallets...
00:46:33.750,00:46:36.669,"It's a harmless little habit, really."
00:46:36.711,00:46:38.254,"Good heavens, Thomson, look at this."
00:46:38.296,00:46:39.547,"His name's Thompson, too."
00:46:39.589,00:46:41.257,"Oh, what a coincidence."
00:46:41.299,00:46:42.925,"No, Thomson, this is Thomson without a P..."
00:46:42.967,00:46:44.093,As in psychic.
00:46:44.135,00:46:47.597,"No, no, it's Thompson with a P, as in psychologist."
00:46:47.639,00:46:52.101,Look at this one. A green one that I managed to pick from a pickpocket actually pick-pocketing at the time.
00:46:52.143,00:46:53.561,- And this one!
00:46:53.603,00:46:55.480,There is a P in psychic.
00:46:55.521,00:46:56.939,I am not your sidekick.
00:46:56.981,00:46:58.608,"Ooh, smell it, won't you?"
00:46:58.650,00:47:01.026,How dare you!
00:47:01.068,00:47:02.945,- I met you first.
00:47:02.987,00:47:04.447,"- No, you didn't."
00:47:04.489,00:47:05.615,"- No, you did not."
00:47:05.657,00:47:06.616,- Didn't!
00:47:06.658,00:47:07.742,- Listen!
00:47:07.784,00:47:09.243,I can't stand it anymore!
00:47:09.285,00:47:11.078,"All right, I'll come quietly."
00:47:11.120,00:47:12.955,Take them! Take them!
00:47:12.997,00:47:14.123,- Take them all!
00:47:14.165,00:47:16.167,"Pull yourself together, man!"
00:47:16.208,00:47:18.628,We can't take your wallets.
00:47:18.670,00:47:20.630,"Good heavens, Thompson."
00:47:20.672,00:47:22.674,This looks familiar.
00:47:22.715,00:47:23.882,Can't be.
00:47:23.924,00:47:26.051,It is.
00:47:37.271,00:47:39.273,So cold.
00:47:39.315,00:47:42.777,And thirsty.
00:47:42.819,00:47:46.030,My throat is parched.
00:47:46.071,00:47:48.199,Let's see if there's any fresh water.
00:47:52.662,00:47:55.164,Aha.
00:47:55.206,00:47:58.000,What have we here?
00:47:59.585,00:48:01.796,Mmm.
00:48:03.088,00:48:04.549,Tintin?
00:48:04.590,00:48:06.551,Tintin?
00:48:06.592,00:48:08.720,"Come and warm yourself, laddie."
00:48:08.761,00:48:10.971,Captain?
00:48:11.013,00:48:12.390,What have you done?
00:48:12.431,00:48:14.099,"Oh, no need to thank me."
00:48:14.141,00:48:15.434,What?
00:48:15.476,00:48:19.355,"Well, you looked a little cold, so I lit a wee fire."
00:48:19.397,00:48:20.481,In a boat?
00:48:20.523,00:48:22.024,"No, those are our oars."
00:48:22.066,00:48:23.192,We need those oars!
00:48:23.234,00:48:24.652,"Yes, but not for much longer."
00:48:24.694,00:48:25.820,Have you gone mad?
00:48:25.862,00:48:27.572,"Quick, Captain!"
00:48:27.613,00:48:29.615,"- Captain, help me! Quick!"
00:48:29.657,00:48:31.283,What have I done?
00:48:31.325,00:48:33.077,"No, Captain, not that!"
00:48:35.747,00:48:38.708,Thundering typhoons.
00:48:38.750,00:48:40.835,"Well, this is a fine mess."
00:48:40.877,00:48:44.505,"- I'm weak, selfish... hopeless."
00:48:40.877,00:48:46.549,"- We're stranded here, with no hope of rescue, while Sakharine and his men are halfway to Bagghar."
00:48:46.591,00:48:49.009,"Poor, miserable wretch!"
00:48:49.051,00:48:50.469,"Yes, all right."
00:48:50.511,00:48:52.847,"It was his fault, you see."
00:48:52.889,00:48:55.057,It was Sir Francis.
00:48:55.099,00:48:56.933,"Tell me, how did you work that one out?"
00:48:56.975,00:48:59.478,Because he was a figurehead of great courage and bold exploits.
00:48:59.520,00:49:03.023,No one like him ever existed in my family.
00:49:03.065,00:49:05.401,Why do you think I drink?
00:49:05.443,00:49:08.362,Because I know I'll never be like him.
00:49:08.404,00:49:10.448,"No, it's far better that I end it now."
00:49:10.489,00:49:13.284,Put us both out of our misery.
00:49:15.077,00:49:16.871,"What is it, Snowy?"
00:49:16.913,00:49:19.956,I'm gonna lower myself into the sea...
00:49:22.293,00:49:27.172,Into the cold embrace of the big blue...
00:49:27.214,00:49:29.007,Those are Portuguese markings.
00:49:29.049,00:49:31.636,Where is the Karaboudjan registered?
00:49:31.677,00:49:34.639,We're saved!
00:49:34.680,00:49:38.392,"Oh, it's a sign from above!"
00:49:42.772,00:49:46.692,- Troglodytes!
00:49:48.611,00:49:52.615,Mutant malingerers!
00:49:52.657,00:49:53.990,Freshwater politicians!
00:49:54.032,00:49:56.285,"Bad news, Captain."
00:49:56.327,00:49:58.788,- We've only got one bullet.
00:49:58.830,00:50:01.624,We've got one bullet.
00:50:13.135,00:50:15.179,You got him!
00:50:18.975,00:50:21.769,"Ah, well done, my boy."
00:50:29.360,00:50:30.486,"Stay here, Captain."
00:50:30.528,00:50:31.737,Tintin.
00:50:31.779,00:50:33.990,- Tintin!
00:50:34.030,00:50:36.032,Don't take your eyes off of them.
00:50:36.074,00:50:38.870,Hurry up.
00:50:38.911,00:50:40.036,Just as I thought.
00:50:40.078,00:50:42.414,The ignition lead has been cut.
00:50:42.456,00:50:44.082,Lucky shot.
00:50:44.124,00:50:48.504,"One more pass, and we will finish them off."
00:50:48.546,00:50:51.256,Put your hands in the air.
00:50:51.298,00:50:52.633,Now!
00:50:55.720,00:50:59.015,Let's see here.
00:50:59.055,00:51:02.393,"You do know what you're doing, eh, Tintin?"
00:51:02.434,00:51:05.021,Um... more or less.
00:51:07.023,00:51:10.026,"Well, which is it?"
00:51:10.066,00:51:12.778,"Relax, I interviewed a pilot once."
00:51:22.872,00:51:25.666,Which way to North Africa?
00:51:36.969,00:51:38.888,"Captain, look."
00:51:38.930,00:51:40.806,We've caught up with them.
00:51:43.267,00:51:45.185,Wonderful.
00:51:45.227,00:51:47.646,But you think we might find another way to North Africa...
00:51:47.688,00:51:50.733,that doesn't take us through that wall of death?
00:51:55.320,00:51:57.113,We can't turn back.
00:51:57.155,00:51:58.407,Not now.
00:51:58.449,00:52:01.493,- Oh.
00:52:18.719,00:52:20.888,- Aha.
00:52:20.930,00:52:23.432,"- No, Captain!"
00:52:23.474,00:52:26.602,Those are surgical spirits for medicinal purposes only.
00:52:26.644,00:52:28.395,"Quite right, laddie."
00:52:50.918,00:52:53.545,Ooh.
00:53:25.953,00:53:27.955,"No, no, no."
00:53:27.997,00:53:28.914,The fuel tank!
00:53:28.956,00:53:30.666,It's almost empty!
00:53:30.708,00:53:33.711,"Captain, this may sound crazy, but I've got a plan."
00:53:33.752,00:53:37.422,The alcohol in that bottle may give us a few more miles.
00:53:37.464,00:53:41.969,I need you to climb out of the plane and pour it into the fuel tank.
00:53:42.011,00:53:44.262,Christopher Columbus!
00:53:49.727,00:53:52.938,There's a terrible storm out there.
00:53:52.980,00:53:56.358,And... it's raining.
00:53:56.400,00:53:58.694,And you call yourself a Haddock?
00:54:04.742,00:54:05.826,Captain!
00:54:05.868,00:54:08.453,"Captain, can you hear me?"
00:54:08.495,00:54:09.914,Captain?
00:54:09.955,00:54:13.167,- Captain!
00:54:13.209,00:54:14.877,You're doing fine!
00:54:14.919,00:54:17.421,"Now, pour the bottle into the tank!"
00:54:17.462,00:54:20.174,We're running on fumes!
00:54:20.216,00:54:23.761,Fumes!
00:54:48.744,00:54:50.328,"Captain, I can't see!"
00:54:50.370,00:54:52.539,"Land, land!"
00:54:52.581,00:54:54.750,We can't!
00:54:54.792,00:54:56.710,"No, land!"
00:55:04.426,00:55:06.137,"Starboard, starboard!"
00:55:06.178,00:55:08.430,Turn!
00:55:48.762,00:55:50.514,"Hang on, Tintin!"
00:55:52.099,00:55:54.434,I'm coming!
00:56:39.938,00:56:42.066,The land of thirst.
00:56:42.107,00:56:43.650,Land of thirst.
00:56:43.692,00:56:45.236,Will you stop saying that?
00:56:45.277,00:56:46.945,You don't understand.
00:56:46.987,00:56:48.780,I've run out.
00:56:48.822,00:56:51.075,I've run out.
00:56:51.116,00:56:53.369,You don't know what that means.
00:56:53.409,00:56:54.661,"Captain, we have to keep going."
00:56:54.703,00:56:56.038,One step at a time.
00:56:56.080,00:56:57.373,Come on.
00:56:57.413,00:56:58.707,Lean your weight on me.
00:56:58.749,00:57:01.960,A man can only hang on for so long without his vitals.
00:57:02.002,00:57:03.503,"Captain, calm down."
00:57:03.545,00:57:05.463,There are worse things than sobering up.
00:57:05.505,00:57:06.924,"Look, Tintin."
00:57:06.965,00:57:08.508,We're saved.
00:57:08.550,00:57:11.636,"- Water, water!"
00:57:11.678,00:57:14.139,"Stop, Captain!"
00:57:14.181,00:57:15.640,It's just a mirage.
00:57:15.682,00:57:18.894,It was here.
00:57:18.936,00:57:21.105,It was just your mind playing tricks.
00:57:21.146,00:57:23.107,It's the heat.
00:57:23.148,00:57:25.109,I have to go home.
00:57:25.150,00:57:26.443,What?
00:57:26.484,00:57:28.028,I have to go back to the sea.
00:57:28.070,00:57:29.654,"But, Captain, you're hallucinating."
00:57:29.696,00:57:31.740,Look.
00:57:31.782,00:57:35.660,Did you ever see a more beautiful sight?
00:57:35.702,00:57:38.956,She's turning into the wind.
00:57:38.997,00:57:41.583,All sails set.
00:57:41.625,00:57:43.543,Triple masted.
00:57:43.585,00:57:45.421,Double decks.
00:57:45.462,00:57:46.964,Fifty guns.
00:57:47.005,00:57:49.133,The Unicorn?
00:57:49.174,00:57:50.634,Isn't she a beauty?
00:57:50.675,00:57:52.428,"Yes, yes she is."
00:57:52.469,00:57:54.096,"Tell me, Captain..."
00:57:54.138,00:57:56.514,What else can you see?
00:57:56.556,00:57:59.684,She's got the wind behind her.
00:57:59.726,00:58:02.313,Look at the pace she's setting.
00:58:02.354,00:58:05.482,Barely a day out of Barbados...
00:58:05.523,00:58:11.529,"...a hold full of rum and the finest tobacco, and the hearts of sailors set for home."
00:58:38.432,00:58:40.267,The red pennant.
00:58:40.309,00:58:46.315,"The blood runs cold in every sea captain who looks upon that flag, for he knows he's facing a fight to the death."
00:58:46.357,00:58:53.697,"But Sir Francis is a Haddock, and Haddocks don't flee."
00:58:56.283,00:58:58.327,All hands on deck!
00:58:58.369,00:59:00.371,Gunners to their stations!
00:59:00.412,00:59:05.959,"Let's unload the King's shot into these yellow-bellied, lily livered sea slugs!"
00:59:06.001,00:59:08.045,"Prepare to bring her about, Mr. Nicholls."
00:59:08.086,00:59:09.463,"Aye, aye, Captain!"
00:59:09.505,00:59:11.965,Prepare to bring her about!
00:59:47.501,00:59:50.170,Mr. Nicholls.
00:59:50.212,00:59:51.505,"Right you are, sir."
00:59:51.547,00:59:54.299,Prepare to repel all boarders!
01:00:29.876,01:00:33.046,This way!
01:01:29.769,01:01:33.023,And then he saw him.
01:01:33.064,01:01:36.734,Like a phantom rising from the dead.
01:01:36.776,01:01:39.404,Who?
01:01:39.446,01:01:42.658,"Captain, who did he see?"
01:01:42.699,01:01:45.285,It's gone.
01:01:45.327,01:01:47.871,What do you mean gone?
01:01:47.912,01:01:50.499,What happened next?
01:01:50.541,01:01:52.250,"By Jupiter, I have a beard!"
01:01:52.292,01:01:54.211,Since when did I have a beard?
01:01:54.252,01:01:56.672,"Captain, something happened on the Unicorn."
01:01:56.713,01:01:59.007,It's the key to everything.
01:01:59.049,01:02:00.425,You must try to remember.
01:02:00.467,01:02:03.220,The Unicorn? What?
01:02:03.261,01:02:05.138,- Captain!
01:02:05.180,01:02:07.599,What is happening to me?
01:02:14.565,01:02:17.693,"And to think, all it took was a day in the Sahara."
01:02:17.734,01:02:20.362,"Congratulations, Captain."
01:02:20.404,01:02:22.739,You are sober.
01:02:22.780,01:02:25.242,Sober.
01:02:41.841,01:02:44.010,Good dog.
01:02:44.052,01:02:47.180,This one's alive.
01:02:47.222,01:02:48.515,Check the other.
01:02:48.557,01:02:50.642,"Yes, sir."
01:02:52.519,01:02:54.605,"Company, halt!"
01:02:54.646,01:02:56.440,I'm Lieutenant Delcourt.
01:02:56.481,01:02:58.400,Welcome to the Afghar Outpost.
01:02:58.442,01:03:01.236,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
01:03:01.278,01:03:03.196,Did you find my friend?
01:03:03.238,01:03:06.283,"Yes, but he's not in good shape, I'm afraid."
01:03:06.324,01:03:09.035,He's still suffering the effects of acute dehydration.
01:03:09.077,01:03:10.495,He's quite delirious.
01:03:10.537,01:03:12.914,Why don't we pay him a visit?
01:03:12.956,01:03:16.251,"Ah, Haddock."
01:03:16.293,01:03:17.377,Good!
01:03:17.419,01:03:19.129,I have a visitor for you.
01:03:19.170,01:03:21.465,- Captain.
01:03:21.506,01:03:23.383,I think you've got the wrong room.
01:03:23.425,01:03:26.010,"Captain, it's Tintin."
01:03:26.052,01:03:28.221,Our plane crashed in the desert.
01:03:28.263,01:03:30.098,- Don't you remember?
01:03:30.140,01:03:31.975,"No no, I'm a naval man myself."
01:03:32.016,01:03:33.310,I never fly if I can help it.
01:03:33.351,01:03:35.103,He's got me confused with someone else.
01:03:35.145,01:03:36.480,Hmm.
01:03:36.521,01:03:38.356,What is this peculiar liquid?
01:03:38.398,01:03:40.900,There's no bouquet.
01:03:40.942,01:03:44.279,"- Why, it's water."
01:03:45.739,01:03:51.035,"We suspect he has a concussion, heatstroke, delirium."
01:03:51.077,01:03:52.704,He's sober.
01:03:52.746,01:03:54.623,"Now, Captain, out in the desert..."
01:03:54.665,01:03:57.751,- Desert?
01:03:57.793,01:03:59.711,- Sir who?
01:03:59.753,01:04:02.506,And you were telling me about what happened on the Unicorn.
01:04:02.547,01:04:04.424,- The Unicorn.
01:04:04.466,01:04:06.968,The stuff that dreams are made of.
01:04:07.010,01:04:09.179,Wee children's dreams.
01:04:09.220,01:04:10.514,"No, the ship."
01:04:10.555,01:04:12.641,"Please try to remember, Captain."
01:04:12.683,01:04:15.101,Lives are at risk.
01:04:18.062,01:04:20.064,"Snowy, what have you done?"
01:04:20.106,01:04:23.276,Ahh.
01:04:24.569,01:04:27.197,I'd stand back if I were you.
01:04:29.407,01:04:31.368,He's snapped!
01:04:31.409,01:04:32.910,"Everybody, out of the room!"
01:04:32.952,01:04:35.038,- Snowy!
01:04:35.079,01:04:37.123,- He's insane!
01:04:43.714,01:04:47.634,"Show yourself, Red Rackham!"
01:04:53.181,01:04:56.518,"If it's a fight you want, you've met your match!"
01:04:56.560,01:04:58.102,A fight with who?
01:04:58.144,01:05:02.148,"To the death, Red Rackham!"
01:05:24.337,01:05:26.423,"No, wait!"
01:05:29.133,01:05:31.386,Wait. Captain...
01:05:31.428,01:05:34.222,I remember everything now.
01:05:34.264,01:05:36.933,Everything granddaddy told me.
01:05:36.974,01:05:40.270,The Unicorn was taken.
01:05:40.311,01:05:42.939,And the pirates were now masters of the ship.
01:05:42.980,01:05:45.108,The crew surrendered?
01:05:45.149,01:05:55.827,"Granddaddy said that Red Rackham called Sir Francis the King's dog, a pirate hunter sent to reclaim their hard-won plunder."
01:05:55.869,01:06:04.085,"Why would I waste my time on rum, tobacco, molasses, and dates, when you have a more valuable cargo onboard?"
01:06:04.127,01:06:06.087,Where is it?
01:06:06.129,01:06:08.590,You'll have to kill me first.
01:06:08.632,01:06:10.550,"Not first, no."
01:06:10.592,01:06:12.218,"No, please!"
01:06:12.260,01:06:14.429,I'll start with your men.
01:06:16.932,01:06:19.142,To save his men...
01:06:19.183,01:06:22.228,...he would give up the secret cargo.
01:06:22.270,01:06:23.897,And where was it?
01:06:42.540,01:06:48.505,"of gold, jewels, and treasure."
01:06:57.764,01:06:59.891,Kill his men!
01:06:59.933,01:07:01.643,"No, Rackham, no!"
01:07:03.186,01:07:04.813,"Rackham, you gave me your word!"
01:07:04.855,01:07:06.690,Rackham!
01:07:06.731,01:07:09.359,Rackham!
01:07:11.903,01:07:14.197,Sir Francis knew he was doomed.
01:07:14.238,01:07:17.826,That he'd be hung from the highest yardarm.
01:07:17.868,01:07:21.120,But they didn't reckon on one thing.
01:07:21.162,01:07:29.086,"Sir Francis was a Haddock, and a Haddock always has a trick up his sleeve."
01:07:46.145,01:07:48.439,"With that, he hurls himself forward."
01:07:48.481,01:07:50.734,On the pirates?
01:07:50.775,01:07:56.781,"No, on a bottle of rum rolling on the deck, and he opens it up, and puts it to his lips..."
01:07:56.823,01:07:58.324,And then he stops.
01:07:58.366,01:08:01.578,"This is no time for drinking, he says, I need all my wits about me."
01:08:01.619,01:08:04.873,"With that, he puts down the bottle, and..."
01:08:04.915,01:08:06.750,"Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle."
01:08:06.791,01:08:08.585,And he seizes a cutlass!
01:08:08.626,01:08:18.261,"And then he makes his way to the ship's magazine, where they keep all the gunpowder and shot."
01:08:31.024,01:08:33.276,You dog!
01:08:33.317,01:08:34.819,You'd blow us sky high?
01:08:34.861,01:08:37.572,"Come on, then."
01:08:37.614,01:08:39.323,Let's have you!
01:08:42.118,01:08:44.621,Not this time.
01:09:44.472,01:09:46.099,You...
01:09:46.141,01:09:47.892,"Captain, what is it?"
01:09:50.645,01:09:53.439,How could I be so blind?
01:09:53.481,01:09:55.441,What are you talking about?
01:09:55.483,01:09:59.320,It isn't just about the scrolls...
01:09:59.362,01:10:02.490,...or the treasure that went down with the ship.
01:10:02.532,01:10:06.452,It's me.
01:10:06.494,01:10:09.039,It's me he's after.
01:10:11.248,01:10:15.086,"You'll suffer a curse upon you and your name, Haddock."
01:10:15.128,01:10:17.296,He wants vengeance.
01:10:18.631,01:10:21.258,Come back and face me.
01:10:21.300,01:10:22.552,"- Hurry, Tintin."
01:10:22.593,01:10:24.554,- We're out of time.
01:10:40.486,01:10:42.780,I curse you!
01:10:42.822,01:10:45.200,I curse your name!
01:10:45.241,01:10:47.284,And all who come after!
01:10:47.326,01:10:53.624,"We will meet again, Haddock, in another time, in another life!"
01:11:14.229,01:11:15.438,It was never over!
01:11:15.479,01:11:16.647,I don't understand.
01:11:16.689,01:11:17.815,Who's after your blood?
01:11:17.857,01:11:20.110,- Sakharine.
01:11:20.151,01:11:22.528,He's Red Rackham's descendant.
01:11:22.570,01:11:24.572,- He needs to finish it.
01:11:24.614,01:11:26.991,- Did what?
01:11:27.033,01:11:29.702,Sir Francis sent that treasure to the bottom of the sea.
01:11:29.744,01:11:31.621,He will be damned before he let Red Rackham have it.
01:11:31.662,01:11:33.623,- And he was.
01:11:33.664,01:11:35.458,- No.
01:11:35.499,01:11:38.211,Three clues wrapped in a riddle concealing a secret.
01:11:38.253,01:11:40.922,But only a true Haddock will be able to solve it.
01:11:40.964,01:11:43.174,- What secret?
01:11:43.216,01:11:46.177,To one of the greatest sunken treasures in all history.
01:11:46.219,01:11:48.679,The wreck of the Unicorn.
01:11:48.721,01:11:51.307,He means to steal it.
01:11:51.348,01:11:53.810,The third scroll.
01:11:53.851,01:11:57.063,Billions of blue blistering barnacles!
01:11:57.105,01:12:02.026,"I swear, as the last of the Haddocks, I'll find that treasure before him."
01:12:02.068,01:12:03.694,- To Bagghar.
01:12:03.736,01:12:06.281,To Bagghar!
01:12:24.715,01:12:28.469,- He's here.
01:12:50.992,01:12:53.911,It's no good.
01:12:57.207,01:13:01.752,"Captain, don't look now, but we're being followed."
01:13:02.920,01:13:05.173,"Yes, we are."
01:13:08.718,01:13:09.969,What do you want?
01:13:10.011,01:13:11.888,Why are you following us?
01:13:11.929,01:13:14.724,Who are you working for?
01:13:14.765,01:13:16.226,"Captain, stop! Stop!"
01:13:16.267,01:13:18.186,Thomson and Thompson.
01:13:18.228,01:13:20.479,Not so loud.
01:13:20.521,01:13:23.358,So I see.
01:13:23.399,01:13:25.902,"Yes, well, bit of a long story, that."
01:13:25.943,01:13:30.323,"The upshot is we caught the thief, retrieved your wallet, then hopped on the next plane to Bagghar."
01:13:30.365,01:13:33.159,"Yes, that pocket-picker has picked his last pocket."
01:13:33.201,01:13:35.912,Here. Don't worry.
01:13:35.953,01:13:38.289,It's not the money I'm worried about.
01:13:42.501,01:13:44.837,The odds are even.
01:13:44.879,01:13:48.299,Now to find the next two scrolls.
01:13:53.054,01:13:55.431,The Milanese Nightingale.
01:14:02.397,01:14:04.565,That's his secret weapon.
01:14:04.607,01:14:06.650,- My!
01:14:08.236,01:14:10.321,What a dish.
01:14:15.451,01:14:17.161,"Enchanted, signora!"
01:14:17.203,01:14:19.914,Benvenuto!
01:14:19.956,01:14:23.084,We are blessed with your presence.
01:14:23.126,01:14:26.921,"Oh yes, indeed, Signor Salad."
01:14:26.963,01:14:30.633,What charming peasants.
01:14:30.674,01:14:34.137,May I introduce my escort?
01:14:34.178,01:14:37.223,Monsieur Shuggair Addeitiff.
01:14:37.265,01:14:39.892,He's been very...
01:14:41.269,01:14:44.688,...passionate in his support of this concert.
01:14:44.730,01:14:48.609,It's my first visit to the Third World.
01:14:48.651,01:14:51.695,Please forgive me.
01:14:51.737,01:14:53.781,- Excuse us.
01:14:53.823,01:14:55.825,"Bravo, bravo."
01:14:55.866,01:14:58.328,Oh.
01:14:58.369,01:15:01.622,- After you.
01:15:11.299,01:15:12.883,"Hello, how are you?"
01:15:12.925,01:15:15.136,"Hello, darling."
01:15:18.181,01:15:20.599,Here. I want you to look after this.
01:15:20.641,01:15:21.767,What are you doing?
01:15:21.809,01:15:22.810,- Me?
01:15:22.852,01:15:24.895,Are you sure?
01:15:24.937,01:15:26.856,"If I'm caught, I don't want them to find this on me."
01:15:26.897,01:15:29.066,"Look, just keep it hidden."
01:15:29.108,01:15:31.610,I will guard this with my life.
01:15:31.652,01:15:32.987,Get up!
01:16:09.023,01:16:13.110,That's her.
01:17:02.826,01:17:05.496,Blistering barnacles.
01:17:05.538,01:17:09.125,What's that noise?
01:17:14.380,01:17:16.882,My ears...
01:17:16.924,01:17:19.135,They're bleeding.
01:17:19.176,01:17:20.928,"No, they're not."
01:17:34.775,01:17:36.527,"Shut up, Snowy."
01:17:43.618,01:17:45.369,"Oh, Columbus!"
01:17:45.411,01:17:48.664,Make way. Make way.
01:17:59.634,01:18:01.677,Aha!
01:18:10.894,01:18:12.188,That was close.
01:18:13.772,01:18:15.232,"Hello, Captain."
01:18:15.274,01:18:17.985,You...
01:18:52.936,01:18:54.313,"Oh, no."
01:18:55.772,01:18:58.901,Sakharine.
01:19:25.511,01:19:27.638,"Snowy, after him!"
01:19:27.680,01:19:30.057,Tintin! Tintin!
01:19:30.099,01:19:31.601,"Those two, there!"
01:19:31.642,01:19:33.352,They're here to steal your ship!
01:19:33.394,01:19:34.729,"No, no, we're not!"
01:19:34.770,01:19:37.064,Arrest him!
01:19:37.106,01:19:38.482,"Who, me?"
01:19:39.775,01:19:42.111,Thief! Arrest him!
01:20:03.132,01:20:05.008,Captain!
01:20:07.052,01:20:09.096,- Sakharine's got the scroll.
01:20:09.138,01:20:11.474,- What do you mean?
01:20:11.515,01:20:13.100,It's gone.
01:20:13.142,01:20:14.977,How? What happened?
01:20:15.018,01:20:17.020,It was Allan.
01:20:17.062,01:20:21.442,"He knobbled me in the garden, and there was a bottle of alcohol..."
01:20:21.484,01:20:22.735,- There always is.
01:20:22.777,01:20:24.861,"No, not like that."
01:20:26.489,01:20:27.990,I can smell it on you.
01:20:36.457,01:20:37.874,Hurry. Back to the boat.
01:20:39.293,01:20:40.670,Where are you going?
01:20:40.711,01:20:42.045,I'm going after Sakharine.
01:20:42.087,01:20:43.464,- By yourself?
01:20:43.506,01:20:44.548,"- Come on, Snowy!"
01:20:47.802,01:20:51.388,Catch them! Catch them!
01:21:03.400,01:21:04.901,Lose them!
01:21:04.943,01:21:07.070,Get him off our tail!
01:21:19.082,01:21:20.501,Did you hit anything?
01:21:20.543,01:21:22.169,Huh?
01:21:24.004,01:21:26.089,"Oh, dear."
01:21:31.094,01:21:33.930,"Faster, you idiot! Faster!"
01:21:33.972,01:21:35.974,Whoa!
01:21:40.187,01:21:41.938,"- Oh, not again!"
01:21:41.980,01:21:43.982,"I'll have those, thank you."
01:21:44.024,01:21:45.609,"Come on, Snowy."
01:21:45.651,01:21:48.111,Incoming falcon at four o'clock.
01:22:00.791,01:22:03.460,"Tintin, faster!"
01:22:05.880,01:22:07.172,"No, the scrolls!"
01:22:07.214,01:22:10.092,"- I got one, two!"
01:22:11.927,01:22:13.303,Snowy!
01:22:23.105,01:22:25.649,"Oh, no!"
01:22:25.691,01:22:28.193,"Come here, my beauty!"
01:22:30.320,01:22:32.948,Ten thousand thundering typhoons!
01:22:32.989,01:22:35.075,"Come here, you pilfering parakeet!"
01:22:36.786,01:22:39.162,"Captain, the bird!"
01:22:44.668,01:22:47.129,"Nice work, Snowy!"
01:22:55.262,01:22:57.765,Blistering barnacles!
01:22:57.807,01:22:59.934,"Hang on, Snowy!"
01:22:59.975,01:23:02.060,"Snowy, I'm coming!"
01:23:07.274,01:23:08.984,There he is! Stop!
01:23:09.025,01:23:10.820,That's right. That's right.
01:23:10.861,01:23:13.614,Come to Daddy.
01:23:13.656,01:23:15.532,Gotcha!
01:23:16.283,01:23:17.534,No!
01:23:21.664,01:23:23.916,Geronimo!
01:23:25.793,01:23:28.838,"You double-dealing, pilfering parasites!"
01:23:35.719,01:23:37.972,Excuse me!
01:23:38.013,01:23:39.974,Sorry!
01:24:07.751,01:24:10.754,Gotcha.
01:24:13.423,01:24:15.425,The scrolls are lining up.
01:24:15.467,01:24:18.053,These are hidden numbers.
01:24:20.138,01:24:23.851,- What does it say?
01:24:23.893,01:24:26.228,Let the bird go.
01:24:28.188,01:24:30.190,- What do you value more?
01:24:30.232,01:24:33.027,- Those scrolls or Haddock's life?
01:24:33.109,01:24:35.404,"You'll never get away with this, you sour-faced sassonack."
01:24:35.445,01:24:36.572,I will kill him.
01:24:38.657,01:24:40.492,"Don't worry about me, Tintin."
01:24:40.534,01:24:45.247,"Let the bird go now, - or this man dies!"
01:24:45.288,01:24:47.499,You two-timing troglodyte.
01:24:47.541,01:24:50.002,You simpering son of a po-faced profiteer.
01:24:50.044,01:24:52.212,Perhaps we should put it to the test.
01:24:52.254,01:24:53.672,Here's mud in your eye.
01:24:53.714,01:24:55.674,Fathead!
01:24:55.716,01:24:57.843,Captain!
01:25:21.366,01:25:23.953,We're saved!
01:25:23.994,01:25:25.704,I love the beach.
01:25:25.746,01:25:27.039,You said you wanted a holiday.
01:25:27.081,01:25:29.207,Very good.
01:25:32.628,01:25:34.964,Hmm? Hmm.
01:25:37.883,01:25:39.468,Nobody takes my ship!
01:25:39.509,01:25:41.428,They've already taken it.
01:25:41.470,01:25:44.098,Nobody takes my ship twice!
01:25:44.139,01:25:46.016,"We'll show them, won't we, Tintin?"
01:25:46.058,01:25:48.143,"- All right, then."
01:25:48.184,01:25:50.479,Of course there's a plan.
01:25:50.520,01:25:51.855,Not this time.
01:25:51.897,01:25:54.066,Sakharine has the scrolls.
01:25:54.108,01:25:55.567,They'll lead him to the treasure.
01:25:55.609,01:25:57.527,It could be anywhere in the world.
01:25:57.569,01:25:59.321,We'll never see him again.
01:25:59.362,01:26:01.031,It's over.
01:26:02.658,01:26:04.994,I thought you were an optimist.
01:26:05.035,01:26:07.037,"You were wrong, weren't you?"
01:26:07.079,01:26:08.705,I'm a realist.
01:26:08.747,01:26:10.874,That's just another name for a quitter.
01:26:10.916,01:26:13.002,You can call me what you like.
01:26:13.043,01:26:14.628,Don't you get it?
01:26:14.670,01:26:16.588,We failed.
01:26:16.630,01:26:18.632,Failed?
01:26:18.674,01:26:22.970,There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure.
01:26:23.012,01:26:25.764,"A fool, a loser."
01:26:25.806,01:26:28.183,A hopeless souse!
01:26:28.224,01:26:30.894,Don't you ever say it of yourself.
01:26:32.521,01:26:34.523,You send out the wrong signal...
01:26:34.564,01:26:36.483,That is what people pick up.
01:26:36.525,01:26:38.610,Do you understand?
01:26:38.652,01:26:41.571,"You care about something, you fight for it."
01:26:41.613,01:26:43.239,You hit a wall...
01:26:43.281,01:26:45.784,You push through it.
01:26:45.826,01:26:50.747,"There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin."
01:26:54.292,01:26:56.920,You can never let it defeat you.
01:26:56.962,01:26:59.673,What did you just say?
01:26:59.715,01:27:02.092,"You hit a wall, you push through it."
01:27:02.134,01:27:06.013,"No, no, no."
01:27:08.473,01:27:10.642,Of course!
01:27:10.684,01:27:14.146,"Captain, I sent a radio message from the Karaboudjan."
01:27:14.188,01:27:16.565,I know what radio frequency they're transmitting on.
01:27:16.606,01:27:18.358,How does that help us?
01:27:18.400,01:27:20.110,All we have to do is send that information to Interpol.
01:27:20.152,01:27:22.821,"They can track the signals, and figure out which way they're headed."
01:27:22.863,01:27:24.031,Here comes Interpol now.
01:27:25.699,01:27:28.160,"Any port they enter, we'll know at once."
01:27:28.202,01:27:30.871,And we can get there first.
01:27:43.175,01:27:44.676,"What are we doing here, boss?"
01:27:44.718,01:27:46.302,We're right back where we started.
01:27:46.344,01:27:47.721,You're to speak of this to no one.
01:27:47.763,01:27:49.098,Keep your mouths shut.
01:27:49.139,01:27:51.016,"Don't worry, as long as we get our share."
01:27:51.058,01:27:52.601,"Oh, you'll get your share."
01:27:52.642,01:27:54.394,- Where are you going?
01:27:54.436,01:27:56.438,- Where's the filthy moola?
01:27:56.479,01:27:58.607,I trust you had a successful trip abroad?
01:27:58.648,01:28:00.650,Do I pay you to talk to me?
01:28:00.692,01:28:03.570,You don't pay me at all.
01:28:05.155,01:28:07.199,What the blazes? Nestor!
01:28:07.241,01:28:10.035,Nestor!
01:28:13.705,01:28:15.498,You blithering idiots!
01:28:15.540,01:28:18.043,Don't just stand there!
01:28:23.423,01:28:26.676,like a rat in a trap.
01:28:26.718,01:28:28.637,"Congratulations, gentlemen."
01:28:28.678,01:28:29.888,He's all yours.
01:28:29.930,01:28:34.017,Yes. We also have an arrest warrant issued by both Interpol and the FBI.
01:28:34.059,01:28:36.228,- Your friend who got shot...
01:28:36.270,01:28:39.355,He was one of their agents.
01:28:39.397,01:28:40.899,It still doesn't make sense.
01:28:40.941,01:28:45.361,"He has the key to the treasure of the Unicorn, which is sitting somewhere in the ocean floor."
01:28:45.403,01:28:47.948,Why would he come back home?
01:28:52.077,01:28:53.787,Right.
01:28:55.330,01:28:57.332,That's Mr. Sakharine to you.
01:28:57.373,01:28:59.584,Ah-ah! Hold it.
01:29:05.381,01:29:06.883,Look out!
01:29:06.925,01:29:08.426,"What? Oh, no!"
01:29:13.389,01:29:15.934,Get me down!
01:29:19.437,01:29:21.315,What? Not that way!
01:29:24.734,01:29:27.362,"Not that way, you fool!"
01:29:27.403,01:29:29.698,No!
01:29:40.334,01:29:42.294,Hmm.
01:29:45.339,01:29:47.257,Right.
01:29:49.676,01:29:51.761,Ah.
01:30:07.443,01:30:10.364,Look out!
01:30:29.091,01:30:30.884,Good Lord! Come on!
01:30:39.393,01:30:41.728,"Close, but no cigar."
01:31:20.934,01:31:22.811,Red Rackham.
01:31:22.852,01:31:24.729,"That's right, my ancestor."
01:31:24.771,01:31:27.149,Just as Sir Francis was yours.
01:31:27.190,01:31:30.152,Unfinished business.
01:31:30.193,01:31:31.820,"I'm glad you know the truth, Haddock."
01:31:31.861,01:31:38.534,"Until you could remember, killing you wouldn't have been this much fun."
01:32:02.725,01:32:06.313,Who gave you permission to board my ship?
01:32:06.355,01:32:07.939,I don't need it.
01:32:07.981,01:32:10.150,I've never needed it.
01:32:21.286,01:32:23.746,- Ah!
01:32:23.788,01:32:25.415,"Ah! Oh, oh."
01:32:32.255,01:32:33.923,There.
01:33:11.878,01:33:16.716,"The legend says, only a Haddock can discover the secret of the Unicorn."
01:33:17.967,01:33:21.096,But it took a Rackham to get the job done.
01:33:21.137,01:33:23.639,"So you've lost again, Haddock."
01:33:23.681,01:33:26.976,That's right.
01:33:27.018,01:33:30.105,"It's all you've got left, isn't it?"
01:33:30.146,01:33:33.858,Everything that was rightfully yours is now mine.
01:33:33.900,01:33:36.111,Including this ship.
01:33:40.198,01:33:43.701,Thundering typhoons.
01:33:43.743,01:33:45.661,Nobody takes my ship.
01:34:05.765,01:34:07.434,"We have you now, you devil."
01:34:07.476,01:34:09.352,You are under arrest.
01:34:09.394,01:34:13.231,"To be precise, you are under arrest."
01:34:27.745,01:34:29.539,Do you see?
01:34:31.583,01:34:34.043,Blistering barnacles.
01:34:34.085,01:34:36.546,It took all three scrolls to form the numbers.
01:34:36.588,01:34:38.548,Latitude and longitude.
01:34:38.590,01:34:39.924,That is it.
01:34:39.966,01:34:41.926,That's the location of the treasure.
01:34:44.554,01:34:48.391,We did it!
01:34:58.485,01:35:01.279,"Almost there, Mr. Tintin!"
01:35:01.321,01:35:03.948,A nudge to starboard should do it.
01:35:03.990,01:35:05.492,Are you sure we're on course?
01:35:05.534,01:35:07.327,"Trust me, laddie."
01:35:07.369,01:35:11.206,I know these parts like the back of my hand.
01:35:11.247,01:35:12.999,Starboard!
01:35:13.041,01:35:14.334,Quickly! Quickly!
01:35:14.376,01:35:16.461,"Aye, Captain."
01:35:24.052,01:35:26.346,All stop!
01:35:30.933,01:35:35.146,Marlinspike Hall.
01:35:35.188,01:35:38.024,Those coordinates lead here.
01:35:38.066,01:35:41.903,- And this is where Sir Francis hid it?
01:35:41.944,01:35:44.197,I thought the treasure went down with the ship.
01:35:44.239,01:35:46.700,"Master Haddock, Mr. Tintin..."
01:35:46.740,01:35:48.784,I've been expecting you.
01:35:50.662,01:35:52.539,Welcome to Marlinspike Hall.
01:35:52.581,01:35:54.916,Will you look at this place?
01:35:54.957,01:35:57.835,I don't think it's changed at all since I was a wee boy.
01:35:57.877,01:36:03.007,"And may I say, sir, how much I'm looking forward to having a Haddock back in charge of the estate."
01:36:03.049,01:36:05.176,"You'll be waiting a long time, mister."
01:36:05.218,01:36:07.387,There's no way I could afford to live here.
01:36:07.429,01:36:10.306,"Well, Captain, you know the house."
01:36:10.348,01:36:13.017,Where do we start?
01:36:13.059,01:36:15.645,Is the cellar still here?
01:36:25.363,01:36:27.282,"No, this isn't it."
01:36:27.323,01:36:28.866,I meant the other cellar.
01:36:28.908,01:36:31.785,"I'm sorry, sir."
01:36:31.827,01:36:33.622,It was bigger than this.
01:36:33.663,01:36:34.664,Snowy?
01:36:36.249,01:36:37.542,"Snowy, where are you?"
01:36:37.584,01:36:39.461,"- No, Hector."
01:36:41.588,01:36:43.047,Hector.
01:36:43.089,01:36:45.007,"Captain, help me."
01:36:48.052,01:36:49.095,Heel!
01:36:55.017,01:36:56.728,Snowy?
01:36:58.605,01:37:01.650,"Just like you said, Captain."
01:37:01.691,01:37:04.319,You hit a wall...
01:37:04.360,01:37:07.530,You push through it.
01:37:10.241,01:37:14.788,My grandfather must have walled it up before he lost the house.
01:37:14.828,01:37:17.791,And then shines forth the Eagle's Cross.
01:37:24.547,01:37:28.050,"I can see the cross, but where's the eagle?"
01:37:28.092,01:37:32.180,"St. John the Evangelist, who was always depicted with an eagle."
01:37:32.221,01:37:35.099,And he's called The Eagle of Patmos.
01:37:35.141,01:37:37.602,He is the eagle.
01:37:39.270,01:37:41.773,"What's he trying to tell us, Captain?"
01:37:41.815,01:37:44.567,I'm at a loss.
01:37:44.609,01:37:48.154,"That island, the one in the middle, that doesn't exist."
01:37:49.863,01:37:51.533,Because I sailed those waters.
01:37:51.574,01:37:53.326,Countless times I've been there.
01:37:53.368,01:37:55.537,It's a mistake.
01:37:57.664,01:38:01.584,What if it isn't?
01:38:01.626,01:38:05.921,Sir Francis wanted his inheritance to go to a man who's worthy of it.
01:38:05.963,01:38:11.511,"A man like himself, who knows the seas like the back of his hand."
01:38:11.553,01:38:20.186,"A man who could look at a globe, and tell if one tiny island was out of place."
01:38:34.033,01:38:36.077,Blistering treasure.
01:38:36.118,01:38:39.455,It's Red Rackham's barnacles.
01:38:44.043,01:38:47.255,What is this?
01:38:47.296,01:38:49.215,Oh.
01:39:28.254,01:39:29.798,Just a wee tipple.
01:39:29.839,01:39:32.550,- A toast...
01:39:32.592,01:39:34.677,To our good fortune.
01:39:36.596,01:39:38.013,That's better.
01:39:38.055,01:39:39.849,"It's odd, really."
01:39:38.055,01:39:41.975,"You would've thought, after all the fuss and bother, there would've been more..."
01:39:42.017,01:39:44.520,- More of what?
01:39:44.562,01:39:47.148,"I mean, by your account, he looted half of South America."
01:39:47.189,01:39:48.858,I just thought...
01:39:48.900,01:39:50.902,"Never mind, there's plenty to go around."
01:39:52.821,01:39:55.490,"- It's a funny life, huh?"
01:39:55.531,01:39:57.951,"Well, you've got your story for your newspaper."
01:39:57.991,01:40:00.912,All's well that ends well.
01:40:00.954,01:40:03.331,It's not ended.
01:40:03.372,01:40:05.999,Sir Francis left another clue at the bottom of the globe.
01:40:06.041,01:40:07.669,A clue to what?
01:40:07.710,01:40:09.587,Four-hundredweight of gold.
01:40:09.629,01:40:12.882,Just lying at the bottom of the sea.
01:40:12.924,01:40:16.511,"How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?"
01:40:18.387,01:40:22.224,"Unquenchable, Tintin."
