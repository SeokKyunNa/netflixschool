00:01:10.653,00:01:26.211,"are the fictions of empires, while everything forgotten hangs in dark dreams of the past, ever threatening to return."
00:01:55.907,00:01:57.242,Lord in heaven.
00:02:02.163,00:02:03.164,Come quickly!
00:02:25.061,00:02:26.271,I want to be a farmer.
00:02:27.647,00:02:29.232,I want to be a barrister.
00:02:29.315,00:02:30.817,I want to be a truck driver.
00:02:31.901,00:02:34.070,I want to be a pop idol.
00:03:14.027,00:03:16.654,is the happiest time in life.
00:03:18.573,00:03:22.243,"But as long as he could remember, Jack Fairy knew better."
00:03:28.207,00:03:40.470,"Until one mysterious day, when Jack would discover that somewhere there were others… quite like him, singled out for a great gift."
00:03:54.525,00:04:02.700,"And one day, the whole stinking world… would be theirs."
00:06:41.984,00:06:54.997,"in sparkle makeup and glittering frocks… as the boys and girls of the current glam-rock craze… pay tribute to their patron saint, pop star Brian Slade, and his space-age rock persona, Maxwell Demon."
00:06:59.043,00:07:02.338,"Lipstick Traces, his last album, was just something special to me."
00:07:02.421,00:07:05.883,It was an album that just appealed to so many people.
00:07:08.094,00:07:14.809,can be felt outside London's Lyceum Theatre… as fans await the final show of Slade's smash world tour.
00:07:14.892,00:07:23.151,Security around the performer has tightened… following a recent BBC interview in which he admitted… to premonitions of being assassinated on stage.
00:07:23.234,00:07:24.068,Turn it off.
00:07:28.406,00:07:32.994,"some of whom have been queuing here since-- Brian, time."
00:07:43.254,00:08:00.021,"The Lyceum Theatre, in cooperation with Bijou Music, is proud to present… straight back from their fantastically successful European tour, Maxwell Demon and the Venus in Furs!"
00:10:19.118,00:10:22.330,Hide the moon. Hide the stars.
00:10:29.545,00:10:32.548,full of strange flowers and subtle perfumes.
00:10:35.259,00:10:39.055,A land of which it is joy of all joys to dream.
00:10:41.015,00:10:45.353,A land where all things are perfect and poisonous.
00:11:11.879,00:11:16.759,have fashioned a whole new bent on the so-called sexual liberation of the flower power set.
00:11:16.842,00:11:25.059,"The long hair and love beads have given way to glitter makeup, platform shoes and a whole new taste for glamour, nostalgia and just plain outrageousness."
00:11:26.977,00:11:29.063,London is improving.
00:11:29.146,00:11:34.652,"Well, I think it's a disgrace, parading around all ponced up like a pack of bleeding woofters."
00:11:34.735,00:11:36.237,"Bloody hell, what'll they think up next?"
00:11:43.452,00:11:56.632,"is none other than pop giant Brian Slade, whose stylish escapades have paved the way for a whole new breed of performing artists, from Curt Wild and the Flaming Creatures to Jack Fairy and Pauly Small."
00:11:56.715,00:11:59.885,"Thanks to Slade, today's youngsters are singing a whole new tune."
00:12:01.929,00:12:04.598,"Yeah. I like boys, I like girls."
00:12:04.682,00:12:10.438,"They're all great. No difference, is there… Mr. BBC?"
00:12:10.521,00:12:14.900,Rock music has always been a reaction to accepted standards.
00:12:17.862,00:12:21.115,"At the moment, having a gay image is the in thing."
00:12:21.198,00:12:28.456,"You know, just like a few years ago, it was trendy to wear a long gray coat… with a Led Zeppelin record under your arm."
00:12:28.539,00:12:32.460,Everyone's into this scene because it's supposedly the thing to do right now.
00:12:32.543,00:12:35.045,"But you just can't fake being gay, you know?"
00:12:35.129,00:12:39.633,"If you’re gonna claim that you're gay, you're gonna have to make love in gay style."
00:12:40.176,00:12:42.595,Most of these kids just aren't gonna make it.
00:12:43.512,00:12:46.974,"That line, everyone's bisexual, it's a popular thing to say now."
00:12:47.057,00:12:48.934,"Personally, I think it's meaningless."
00:13:04.617,00:13:09.580,"I knew I should create a sensation, gasped the rocket, and he went out."
00:13:18.797,00:13:21.342,It was a stunt. The guy faked his own murder.
00:13:24.762,00:13:26.347,"Arthur, any recollection?"
00:13:28.641,00:13:31.810,-Of what? -With this Slade fellow?
00:13:34.772,00:13:39.610,"Well, he's a… early '70s glam-rock singer."
00:13:39.693,00:13:42.613,Told you we can count on Mr. Old Time Rock and Roll.
00:13:44.073,00:13:45.282,Count on me for what?
00:13:48.285,00:13:50.496,I thought I was on the Reynolds trip.
00:13:53.332,00:13:55.834,and I need a piece for the Weekender now.
00:13:58.170,00:13:59.004,Great.
00:14:01.632,00:14:06.220,Next week is the tenth-year anniversary of the whole shooting stunt incident.
00:14:07.096,00:14:11.016,"I'd like you to find out what happened, where he is today."
00:14:11.100,00:14:13.811,Whatever happened to Brian Slade? Okay?
00:14:13.894,00:14:19.775,"Yeah, and, naturally you want me for this because, um, I'm the resident Brit, right?"
00:14:19.859,00:14:22.486,"No. No, no, no."
00:14:22.570,00:14:24.947,No. I want you because you remember.
00:14:36.292,00:14:54.184,"to sign up at their local government offices and join the Committee… Suddenly I was being paid to remember all the things that money, the future, and a serious life made so certain I'd forget."
00:14:55.519,00:14:56.520,And for what?
00:14:57.438,00:14:59.565,Some meaningless prank a decade old.
00:15:01.025,00:15:10.451,"Why was it suddenly up to me to figure it out when clearly there was something, something from the past, spooking me back?"
00:15:13.871,00:15:17.207,I didn't realize at the time that it was you.
00:15:31.263,00:15:37.394,"Thank you, Transelectric and CRA, Microatlanta and Dupree for their generous support."
00:15:38.228,00:15:44.860,And thanks to President Reynolds's Committee for Cultural Renewal for making this broadcast possible.
00:15:44.944,00:15:53.160,"And thanks to you, the three billion viewers tuning in right now… on global satellite!"
00:16:06.006,00:16:07.883,I saw a man that wasn't there.
00:16:09.468,00:16:12.471,He wasn't there again today.
00:16:12.554,00:16:14.556,How I'd wish he'll go away.
00:16:23.774,00:16:29.947,"Ten years, and the world had changed so completely that the life I led in England seemed like someone else's life."
00:16:30.030,00:16:32.658,Someone else's story.
00:16:32.741,00:16:33.826,Anyone's but mine.
00:16:39.790,00:16:44.086,that the whole of history was merely a record of his own life.
00:16:45.713,00:16:57.725,"Not as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had created it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions."
00:16:59.268,00:17:14.241,"He felt that he'd known them all, those strange, terrible figures that had passed along the stage of life and made sin so marvelous and evil so full of subtlety."
00:17:15.034,00:17:21.707,"It seemed that in some mysterious way, their lives had been his own."
00:18:14.009,00:18:16.053,Can you lend us a couple of quid? I got money at home.
00:18:16.136,00:18:19.056,-You must be mental. -Please. I swear I got it.
00:18:19.139,00:18:19.973,Piss off.
00:18:21.016,00:18:21.934,Thanks.
00:18:24.478,00:18:25.979,-What's it for? -Nothing.
00:18:27.147,00:18:29.233,"Give it here, then. Let's have a look."
00:18:30.025,00:18:30.943,Bloody Nora!
00:18:31.693,00:18:33.654,Our kid's one of them pansy rockers.
00:18:33.737,00:18:35.781,"He's a fucking poof, that one there."
00:18:35.864,00:18:38.575,-He is not. -That's naff. That's naff.
00:18:39.159,00:18:41.453,You're disgusting. You know that?
00:21:26.868,00:21:35.877,"that the shooting on the fifth of February of singer Brian Slade at London's Lyceum Theatre was a publicity stunt mounted by the singer's company, Bijou Music Limited."
00:21:35.961,00:21:43.468,"Manager Jerry Devine announced today that his company meant no harm in their escapades, that it was intended solely as entertainment."
00:21:43.552,00:21:53.061,"Very sad and unfortunate that in this day and age, an artist's quest for artistic freedom should cost him his career."
00:21:55.605,00:21:56.606,Why do you think?
00:22:02.362,00:22:04.364,"No, it got too big, I guess."
00:22:04.448,00:22:08.869,Too… Got too schizoid. You know?
00:22:08.952,00:22:13.206,"I mean, he thought he fuckin' was Maxwell Demon in the end, you know?"
00:22:14.374,00:22:16.418,"And Maxwell Demon, he thought he was God."
00:22:53.622,00:22:55.665,Quite well.
00:22:58.293,00:22:59.920,Once upon a time.
00:23:07.344,00:23:08.553,-So? -Yes?
00:23:11.807,00:23:13.642,"So, um, what was he, um--?"
00:23:14.476,00:23:16.103,What was he like?
00:23:21.650,00:23:22.651,Yeah.
00:23:29.991,00:23:32.202,Like nothing I'd ever seen before.
00:23:38.708,00:23:44.381,"And in the end, like nothing he appeared."
00:23:50.387,00:23:57.144,"He was… elegance, walking arm in arm with a lie."
00:24:05.360,00:24:09.906,and his father owned a small tiling business in suburban Birmingham.
00:24:09.990,00:25:31.863,"But Brian never cared much for the suburbs, and, as a young boy, had the rare fortune of spending a summer in London with his aunt, a figure of some ill repute in the Slade family… after she married a cockney in the entertainment field… would leave a dramatic impression."
00:26:01.393,00:26:03.895,So what are ya? A mod or a rocker?
00:26:03.979,00:26:05.981,"I'm six of one, half a dozen of the other, really."
00:26:11.194,00:26:27.377,"the swank London mods, short for modernists, were the first to wear mascara and lacquer their hair, the first true dandies of pop, and known to just about any indiscretion where a good suit was involved."
00:27:11.087,00:27:13.298,always wins out in the end.
00:27:28.438,00:27:36.905,"Or at least to London, where three years later at the Sombrero Club in Kensington, I would hear him sing for the very first time."
00:27:43.578,00:27:46.664,No club in London had a more notorious sway.
00:27:47.374,00:27:58.551,"And there in the center of it was Brian's American wife, Mandy, whose dramatic transformation to London party girl was a constant source of amusement to us all."
00:27:58.635,00:28:01.054,You all know me. Subtlety's my middle name.
00:28:01.137,00:28:04.182,It's as subtle as the piece of skin between my vagina and my anus.
00:28:06.309,00:28:08.728,What's that called? Does anyone remember what that's called?
00:28:08.812,00:28:10.647,I don't think I quite remember.
00:28:10.730,00:28:12.857,No man's land.
00:28:12.941,00:28:15.235,"Oh, gosh. My geesh, darling!"
00:28:16.361,00:28:35.505,"Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and whomever else may be in the house this evening, it is my supreme pleasure to introduce all you lovely little minskies here tonight to the Sombrero Club's prettiest star… -and my most shimmering hubby. -Shoosh!"
00:28:35.588,00:28:38.633,I give you Brian Slade!
00:30:07.514,00:30:11.017,"-Who is he? -Some scrubber, my dear. I assure you."
00:30:11.100,00:30:14.729,"-But not that scruffy, as I last recall. -Oh, you're wicked!"
00:30:25.114,00:30:27.700,-She won't be back tonight. -Mmm.
00:30:32.747,00:30:35.667,my own management company and on the lookout for new talent.
00:30:37.752,00:30:45.301,"He introduced me to his wife, asked me what sign I was, and before the week was out we were signing contracts."
00:30:49.848,00:30:53.101,"You see, Brian believed in the future."
00:30:55.436,00:31:03.444,He despised the hypocrisy of the peace and love generation and felt his music spoke far more to its orphans and its outcasts.
00:31:03.528,00:31:08.032,"His revolution, he used to say, will be a sexual one."
00:31:09.701,00:31:19.752,"But in 1970, rock audiences bred on Credence Clearwater and the Beatles were not entirely sure what to make of this particular brand of revolt."
00:31:41.357,00:31:43.776,"Don't ask me why. I mean, I thought it was a bit naughty."
00:31:43.860,00:32:05.548,"A bit of a giggle, but, uh… -Some shirt-lifter from Birmingham. -Mmm."
00:32:20.563,00:32:22.774,Cut the shite!
00:32:22.857,00:32:25.068,"Bugger off, you woofter!"
00:32:25.151,00:32:26.319,Fuck off!
00:32:36.079,00:32:37.914,"-Every bit. -Well done, Brian."
00:32:37.997,00:32:40.291,"i was beaming, truly, like someone's mum."
00:32:40.375,00:32:42.585,"Oh, god. And they adored you."
00:32:42.669,00:32:45.546,-The whole lot transported. -Transported?
00:32:45.630,00:32:47.674,We went down like a fuckin' knackered lift!
00:32:47.757,00:32:53.638,"Brian, I tell you, I think it's simply a matter of presentation, -and with the proper backup-- -Backup?"
00:32:53.721,00:32:54.889,What happened to Judy Garland?
00:32:54.973,00:32:56.975,What happened to all your bloody torch song rubbish?
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.893,"I know, I know, in a cab ride."
00:32:58.977,00:33:01.813,"But in the context of a rock show, I see now it's a bit more dodgy."
00:33:01.896,00:33:03.690,"-But the act was there, wasn't it? -Absolutely."
00:33:07.860,00:33:15.076,"lead singer and founder of the greatest garage band known to mankind, Curt Wild!"
00:33:22.250,00:33:25.545,Curt Wild.
00:34:10.506,00:34:22.018,"founder of the influential garage band The Rats, came from the aluminum trailer parks of Michigan, though rock folklore claims far more primitive origins."
00:35:06.270,00:35:16.364,he was discovered by his mother in the family loo at the service of his older brother and promptly shipped off for 18 months of electric shock treatment.
00:35:57.655,00:36:01.534,would fry the fairy clean out of him.
00:36:04.203,00:36:09.792,But all it did was make him bonkers every time he heard electric guitar.
00:36:58.341,00:36:59.342,They despised him.
00:37:04.138,00:37:05.139,Yeah.
00:37:07.600,00:37:13.898,"But when you're abused like that, you know you've touched the stars."
00:37:13.981,00:37:18.861,I know. I just-- I just wish it'd been me.
00:37:24.033,00:37:25.034,I wish I thought of it.
00:37:32.792,00:37:36.504,"You will, love. You will."
00:40:22.670,00:40:26.799,"Devine. Jerry Devine, personal management. I'm interested."
00:40:30.219,00:40:32.847,"-He's, uh-- -Not in my opinion."
00:40:34.890,00:40:37.351,"The truth is, you have talent."
00:40:37.435,00:40:38.269,That's obvious.
00:40:39.437,00:40:42.898,But it doesn't really matter much what a man does with his life.
00:40:42.982,00:40:45.985,What matters is the legend that grows up around him.
00:40:47.153,00:40:48.404,"Today, you're a talented singer."
00:40:49.655,00:40:50.489,That's all right.
00:40:54.452,00:40:55.786,I can make you a star.
00:40:57.079,00:40:59.331,And just how do you propose to do that?
00:41:01.375,00:41:10.050,"I will tell you, sir, when you pin me."
00:41:16.974,00:41:21.061,I have never in all my life— May the best man win.
00:41:54.386,00:42:02.061,newcomer Brian Slade performed his hit single The Whole Shebang dressed in platform boots and wearing glitter eye makeup.
00:42:02.144,00:42:08.817,"A spokesman for the show, known for showcasing pop's brightest stars, says they've been deluged with calls all evening."
00:42:11.237,00:42:16.408,"was wearing glitter eye makeup, and I was out of a bleeding job."
00:42:16.492,00:42:20.704,"And that, as they say, was that."
00:42:22.122,00:42:29.046,"I would not hear another word from Brian or any of them, for that matter… ever again."
00:42:30.631,00:42:34.468,"Have you got any, uh, idea what ultimately happened to him?"
00:42:34.552,00:42:36.929,"I mean, where he is today?"
00:42:37.012,00:42:42.977,"Last I'd heard he'd returned to Birmingham, but this was… three years ago?"
00:42:43.060,00:42:43.894,Four?
00:42:45.187,00:42:48.816,"No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't help you there."
00:42:50.067,00:42:52.486,Looks as though it may be unavoidable.
00:42:53.070,00:42:53.904,What's that?
00:42:54.613,00:42:56.657,"The ex, I'm afraid."
00:42:58.033,00:43:07.668,"But then every story needs a contrary opinion, and with Mandy you're guaranteed… excesses of both."
00:43:14.883,00:43:15.884,Miss Slade?
00:43:19.221,00:43:20.264,Yeah?
00:43:20.347,00:43:21.432,I'm Arthur Stuart.
00:43:23.017,00:43:26.061,From the Herald. We spoke on the phone.
00:43:30.858,00:43:34.320,"Um, anyway, I’ve just got, you know, a few questions I want to ask."
00:43:34.403,00:43:37.781,It shouldn't take long. Do you mind if I sit down?
00:43:38.532,00:43:40.826,"It's a free country, sort of."
00:43:44.371,00:43:45.623,So what are you having?
00:43:47.583,00:43:51.003,Scotch. Rocks.
00:43:52.838,00:43:54.673,Make that two.
00:43:55.758,00:43:59.595,"Gee, you must be after some damn exclusive copy."
00:43:59.678,00:44:03.098,"Well, it's a piece on, um, Brian Slade."
00:44:03.182,00:44:05.809,"What, sort of a memory jog kind of thing?"
00:44:06.477,00:44:14.360,"Yeah. You know, it's been, um, ten years since the whole fake shooting incident."
00:44:14.443,00:44:16.820,And what a fake it was!
00:44:16.904,00:44:20.074,Tricking us all in the end with such an authentic demise.
00:44:21.116,00:44:22.451,"His career, you mean?"
00:44:24.620,00:44:30.793,"I mean, you know, have you got any idea what happened to him… or where he is today?"
00:44:30.876,00:44:35.005,Can't you just run him through the files and punch in the name?
00:44:35.089,00:44:38.050,"No, not exactly."
00:44:38.133,00:44:48.602,"Because honestly, darling, I haven't spoken with Mr. Slade in… seven years, at least."
00:44:48.686,00:44:50.646,Seven years. Wow.
00:44:50.729,00:44:53.816,Wow. Yeah.
00:44:53.899,00:44:55.734,At least. Smoke?
00:44:55.818,00:44:57.027,No thanks.
00:44:57.569,00:45:02.533,"No, right after everything crashed, we… we split."
00:45:03.951,00:45:12.334,"And Brian, he just… became someone else."
00:45:17.089,00:45:19.258,"Then again, he always was."
00:45:41.071,00:45:42.573,"That's ten bob to you, mate."
00:46:00.549,00:46:07.389,"And everywhere you went, there was this sense of the future, the feeling in the air that anything was possible."
00:47:15.791,00:47:27.678,"And in crowded clubs or hotel bars, this shipwreck of the streets… rehearsed his future glory."
00:47:30.097,00:47:33.642,A cigarette tracing a ladder to the stars.
00:48:01.169,00:48:03.213,-Maricon. -Epicene.
00:48:03.297,00:48:05.215,Sexe douteux.
00:48:06.466,00:48:08.385,Le vice anglais.
00:48:17.811,00:48:20.105,to the character of the rock star.
00:48:30.324,00:48:32.951,A true original.
00:48:33.035,00:48:35.037,Everybody stole from Jack.
00:48:38.790,00:48:46.923,"But from the moment Brian Slade stepped into our lives, nothing would ever be the same."
00:48:52.888,00:48:53.889,It was his nature.
00:49:41.603,00:49:43.647,Do you jive?
00:52:18.718,00:52:20.637,They're all speeding up.
00:52:24.683,00:52:28.353,So to cope with this evolutionary paranoia.
00:52:32.941,00:52:46.121,Strange people are chosen… who through their art… Can move progress more quickly.
00:52:51.585,00:52:53.503,of our marriage.
00:53:12.230,00:53:26.953,"I'm Davy Rocket, and we have a very special show for you today, dedicated to one of pop's blazing new talents… and one who's been holding a virtual reign over the British charts… for a startling, record-breaking eighteen-month span."
00:53:27.037,00:53:31.124,"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the incomparable Brian Slade!"
00:53:31.207,00:53:35.128,"Or should I say, Maxwell Demon!"
00:53:41.009,00:53:44.638,Why? Because rock and roll is a prostitute.
00:53:47.349,00:53:54.606,"The music is the mask, while I, in my chiffon and taff-- Well, the farther message."
00:53:58.568,00:54:00.070,The bloke in the suit.
00:54:00.153,00:54:03.073,What about your fans? Aren't they likely to get the wrong impression?
00:54:10.956,00:54:12.707,It doesn't concern me in the least.
00:54:13.375,00:54:21.633,"I should think that if people were to get the wrong impression of me, the one to which you so eloquently refer, it wouldn't be the wrong impression in the slightest."
00:54:21.716,00:54:25.720,"That's me! That's me, Dad! That's me!"
00:54:25.804,00:54:28.431,"I mean, everybody knows most people are bisexual."
00:54:35.563,00:54:36.606,and living in north London.
00:54:36.690,00:54:39.150,"I am married. Quite happily, in fact."
00:54:39.234,00:54:42.320,I just happen to like boys as much as I like girls.
00:54:42.404,00:54:49.119,"And seeing as my wife feels pretty much the same about such things, I should think we've been able to make a fairly decent go of it so far."
00:54:54.541,00:54:55.834,"Okay, thank you very much."
00:54:57.752,00:55:01.172,he was simply telling it like it was.
00:55:01.256,00:55:03.383,Did he realize what he'd actually done?
00:55:03.466,00:55:07.762,"How could he have? I mean, today there'd be fighting in the streets."
00:55:08.680,00:55:13.643,"But in 1972, it was more like dancing."
00:55:36.416,00:55:43.673,That man sitting over there in the white suit… is the biggest thing to come out of this country since sliced Beatles.
00:55:44.883,00:55:48.595,"Outside this country, no one knows who the hell he is."
00:55:50.764,00:55:52.807,"You people, you're gonna change all that."
00:55:54.142,00:55:56.686,"You guys, you're the actors."
00:55:56.770,00:56:03.068,"It's up to you to change Brian Slade, pop singer, into Maxwell Demon, space-age fuckin' superstar."
00:56:04.235,00:56:06.279,Nothing fantastic about it.
00:56:06.362,00:56:08.239,Why?
00:56:08.323,00:56:14.079,Because the secret of becoming a star… is knowing how to behave like one.
00:56:14.162,00:56:16.372,"Hey, kids, let's put on a show!"
00:56:17.540,00:56:18.958,Precisely.
00:56:42.315,00:56:44.234,Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!
00:56:52.617,00:56:55.328,I know it's unprecedented. I know it's unorthodox.
00:56:55.411,00:56:59.415,"But, sir, if you want Brian Slade, those are the terms."
00:56:59.499,00:57:01.334,You may take them or leave them.
00:57:02.127,00:57:04.379,-Yes? -I'm Shannon Hazelbourne.
00:57:04.462,00:57:06.422,-Who? -I rang up about the position.
00:57:06.506,00:57:08.633,"-The what? -Um, assistant clerical aid."
00:57:08.716,00:57:11.344,"Oh, the position. Right. Brilliant. Follow me."
00:57:13.805,00:57:23.815,"I realize, of course, your talents lie within the clerical arts, but I was wondering, per chance, if you had any experience of wardrobe?"
00:57:23.898,00:57:28.695,"Um, no, never. Fantastic! I think that's everything."
00:57:28.778,00:57:30.530,"No, I said I didn't."
00:57:30.613,00:57:38.329,"Everybody, I'd like to introduce you… to our lovely new wardrobe mistress."
00:57:38.413,00:57:41.958,-What's her name? -Um… Shannon.
00:57:42.041,00:57:43.543,Shannon!
00:57:45.545,00:57:46.671,Excellent.
00:57:47.338,00:57:48.465,"Yes, Mr. Weinberg."
00:57:50.800,00:57:53.178,"Thank you very much indeed, sir."
00:57:56.639,00:57:58.183,Extraordinary.
00:58:00.268,00:58:03.313,"-What? -So tell me, Master Demon."
00:58:04.689,00:58:17.035,Who would you most fancy meeting… -Brando for me. -Einstein.
00:58:17.118,00:58:19.954,"-Very sorry, chickee. He's dead. -Jerry said anyone."
00:58:20.038,00:58:22.624,Brian! Who?
00:58:24.751,00:58:27.212,Curt Wild.
00:58:27.295,00:58:29.214,I want to meet Curt Wild.
00:59:35.196,00:59:37.407,I'm Rodney from Electra.
00:59:37.490,00:59:39.158,I have Brian Slade here from England.
00:59:39.242,00:59:41.244,"Just wanted to pop over, say hello."
00:59:41.327,00:59:44.372,"I just wanted to say, I think your music is tops, really."
00:59:45.039,00:59:46.624,Smashing. Best of the lot.
00:59:47.875,00:59:50.044,Smashing.
00:59:50.128,00:59:52.338,Top hole.
00:59:52.422,01:00:04.726,"Jolly f-- Sorry, darling."
01:00:11.858,01:00:15.987,"and Brian knew this, of course, and urged Devine to pursue the situation."
01:00:18.865,01:00:29.751,"an interest arose… in which Brian would serve on some projects, possibly, though not exclusively, as-- We're takin' our lead from you here, Curt."
01:00:29.834,01:00:41.346,"Possibly as a producer on that project, how might that scenario, purely hypothetically, how might that scenario appeal to you at this juncture?"
01:00:42.639,01:00:47.727,"Well, I… What Jerry’s tryin' to say is, do you want to come to London to cut a record?"
01:00:47.810,01:00:49.646,"Oh, yeah. Cool."
01:00:50.563,01:00:51.564,Very good.
01:00:52.940,01:00:55.026,But how can we help you?
01:00:55.109,01:00:57.278,You must tell us. What do you need?
01:01:00.657,01:01:02.533,Everything.
01:01:02.617,01:01:06.412,"See, heroin was my main man."
01:01:06.496,01:01:16.923,"Yeah, but now I'm on the methadone… and I'm getting my act together, and you come here and say… you wanna help, and I say, Hey, far out."
01:01:20.176,01:01:23.304,You could be my main man.
01:01:26.474,01:01:28.142,Happens every day.
01:01:28.226,01:01:34.107,"But for the world to think it was happening, well, that was Jerry’s particular genius."
01:01:38.194,01:01:44.742,Right away he started promoting the two of them like a pair of'40s starlets on the swoon.
01:01:44.826,01:01:48.204,Tracy and Hepburn for the '70s.
01:03:28.763,01:03:30.890,and you fished me out of the muck.
01:03:30.973,01:03:33.184,"You got me back on my feet, you did."
01:03:33.267,01:03:35.228,"It was nothing, chum."
01:03:35.311,01:03:39.148,I wanted to help you make more of that far-out sound.
01:03:39.232,01:04:43.921,"I love your music, my son, and I love… Every great century that produces art is, so far, an artificial century."
01:04:44.005,01:04:51.929,And the work that seems the most natural and simple of its time… is always the result of the most self-conscious effort.
01:04:52.013,01:05:09.989,"I'm not really myself, except… in the midst of elegant crowds, or amid the sumptuous ornamentation of palace hotels, an army of servants… and plush carpet underfoot."
01:05:10.072,01:05:13.242,What's true about music is true about life.
01:05:13.326,01:05:18.956,That beauty reveals everything… because it expresses nothing.
01:05:19.040,01:05:22.501,The first duty in life is to assume a pose.
01:05:22.585,01:05:28.049,"What the second duty is, no one has yet found out."
01:05:38.392,01:05:51.447,"The aesthete gives characteristically cynical evidence, replete with pointed epigram and startling paradox, while explaining his views on morality in art."
01:05:54.367,01:06:01.582,"Maxwell Demon is the story of a space creature who becomes a rock and roll messiah, only to be destroyed by his own success."
01:06:01.666,01:06:04.126,Are you saying this is your destiny?
01:06:04.210,01:06:06.337,Are you Maxwell Demon?
01:06:06.420,01:06:09.090,Man is least himself when he talks in his own person.
01:06:10.174,01:06:12.218,Give him a mask and he'll tell you the truth.
01:06:15.888,01:06:18.849,Is it your belief that all dandies are homosexual?
01:06:19.558,01:06:20.559,Ha!
01:06:20.643,01:06:23.604,Nothing makes one so vain as being told one is a sinner.
01:06:30.277,01:06:33.364,Hey! Comin' through! Comin' through!
01:06:33.447,01:06:36.617,"Hey, guys, watch out. Excuse me."
01:06:37.618,01:06:39.370,Comin' through. Careful now. There you go.
01:06:39.453,01:06:46.127,"Tell us, Brian. Are the rumors true when they say you and Curt Wild have some sort of plans up your sleeve?"
01:06:46.210,01:06:48.254,"Oh, yes."
01:06:48.337,01:06:51.298,Quite soon we actually plan to take over the world.
01:07:01.851,01:07:07.273,"Excuse me, fellas, while I raise a glass to the loveliest man in Europe."
01:07:09.650,01:07:12.111,And they tell you it's not natural.
01:07:28.544,01:07:32.548,The world is changed 'cause you are made of ivory and gold.
01:07:32.631,01:07:35.551,The curves of your lips rewrite history.
01:10:54.541,01:10:55.542,That's it!
01:10:56.835,01:10:58.379,"Jim, what are you gonna do?"
01:11:58.022,01:12:00.524,You bring shame to your mother and me.
01:12:01.900,01:12:06.572,"It's a shameful, filthy thing you're doing."
01:12:06.655,01:12:07.990,Do you hear me?
01:12:09.825,01:12:11.035,Stand up!
01:12:50.324,01:12:54.411,It's funny how beautiful people look when they're walking out the door.
01:13:20.562,01:13:23.774,"I mean, I'm not frustrated. I'm kind of open about it."
01:13:23.857,01:13:26.902,I was having a fabulous time last night myself.
01:13:34.076,01:13:36.787,You shouldn't let it upset you so.
01:13:36.870,01:13:44.920,"Brian's a grown man… and fully capable of shagging whatever he fancies, and exceedingly partial to the practice."
01:13:48.590,01:13:55.139,"you know, two naked people asleep in bed together, it doesn't necessarily prove sex was involved."
01:14:08.694,01:14:11.155,make for a very strong case.
01:14:11.238,01:14:17.202,"But you're a sweet, sensitive darling to be so broken up about it."
01:14:17.286,01:14:20.205,Brian would be absolutely chafed to know that you feel this way.
01:14:20.289,01:14:23.083,-Don't you dare tell Brian! -Ow!
01:14:23.167,01:14:26.420,"Swear to me you'll never say a word, ever."
01:14:39.308,01:14:41.268,Jesus!
01:15:16.970,01:15:19.473,A brief holiday. Much needed.
01:15:20.807,01:15:22.017,Back by Hammersmith.
01:15:24.853,01:15:25.854,B.
01:15:29.066,01:15:30.067,That was it.
01:15:34.154,01:15:36.740,"Look, I'm sorry. I wish I could help you more."
01:15:44.164,01:15:46.500,Don't think I have what you're looking for.
01:15:49.962,01:15:51.505,"See, I think you do, actually."
01:15:54.049,01:15:55.050,"Oh, yeah?"
01:15:57.177,01:15:58.345,And what makes you think so?
01:16:02.224,01:16:03.475,"Well, that smile, for one thing."
01:16:05.644,01:16:08.272,"Well, smiles lie."
01:16:11.483,01:16:12.484,Exactly.
01:16:18.574,01:16:19.575,Listen.
01:16:20.284,01:16:25.414,"Once, of course, there was a gorgeous, gorgeous time."
01:16:25.497,01:16:29.835,We were all… living our dreams.
01:16:33.755,01:16:35.632,"You see, all that went away."
01:16:38.260,01:16:39.261,All of it.
01:16:42.306,01:16:43.307,With Curt.
01:16:44.933,01:16:46.518,And not even the real Curt.
01:16:46.602,01:16:49.938,"I mean, it was the idea of Curt, more than anything."
01:16:52.816,01:16:57.446,"Image, which, of course, nobody could ever possibly live up to."
01:16:57.529,01:17:01.950,"I mean, Maxwell Demon, Curt Wild. They were fictions!"
01:17:08.206,01:17:11.084,Brian seemed to get lost in the lie.
01:17:40.113,01:17:41.114,-Shit! -Cut it.
01:17:56.046,01:17:58.090,He's gonna hit the bridge a half verse early.
01:17:58.173,01:18:00.342,"-Now you're simply wasting tape. -All right, cut it."
01:18:05.222,01:18:06.431,What?
01:18:08.141,01:18:09.351,What? Is there a problem?
01:18:12.354,01:18:14.731,-Again. -What? What?
01:18:17.526,01:18:26.618,"Curt, we only ask that when you decide to make a change, you simply inform us in advance so Eton here is properly prepared. Otherwise-- I don't know what the fuck you're talkin' about, man."
01:18:28.453,01:18:30.122,I didn't make any fuckin' change.
01:18:37.963,01:18:38.964,Brian.
01:18:43.719,01:18:46.054,Fuckin' motherfucker! Motherfucker!
01:18:46.138,01:18:48.640,You're a motherfucker! Fuck you!
01:18:48.724,01:18:50.600,"Fuck you, Motherfucker!"
01:18:52.477,01:18:54.187,"-Fuck! -Eton. Eton, please."
01:18:59.818,01:19:05.949,but what started off as an interesting experiment has quite frankly descended into a demeaning waste of your time and mine.
01:19:06.032,01:19:13.123,"I mean, you've already spent 40 hours studio time-- Whatever. Thirty-six hours studio time on two, three bloody cuts?"
01:19:14.040,01:19:19.588,"Brian, you seem to forget, you're a very big star now, and I think your time is worth a great deal more than this."
01:19:19.671,01:19:23.091,"Space queen on your fuckin' high horse, and all your fuckin' henchmen!"
01:19:23.175,01:19:24.134,Fuck you!
01:19:25.260,01:19:26.261,Fuck you!
01:19:30.098,01:19:32.434,"Perhaps it's time for another little break, eh, fellas?"
01:19:36.062,01:19:37.063,Give us a stretch?
01:19:45.614,01:19:46.948,Jerry?
01:19:52.829,01:19:54.706,"I can't risk extending his contract, Brian."
01:19:56.166,01:19:58.001,I think it's quite clear why.
01:19:59.961,01:20:00.962,Talk to you tomorrow.
01:20:14.142,01:20:15.977,"Piss off! Go on, then!"
01:20:16.061,01:20:20.690,Back to your wolves! Your junkie twerps! Your bloody shock treatment!
01:20:20.774,01:20:22.108,And fuck you too!
01:21:36.641,01:21:39.644,"Well, Brian, I'm afraid that is completely out of the question."
01:21:40.478,01:21:45.567,You are contractually bound… to finish the Maxwell Demon tour as Maxwell Demon.
01:21:48.278,01:21:54.659,"Brian, Brian, I realize you're under tremendous strain, but you’ve just gotta hang on in there and finish the bloody tour."
01:21:55.493,01:21:57.579,"You hang on in there. I'll hang on here, right?"
01:24:42.786,01:24:45.330,I don't believe that there is much of a future to speak of.
01:24:45.997,01:24:48.625,"We're in a bit of a decadent spiral, aren't we?"
01:24:49.751,01:24:51.127,Sinking fast.
01:24:51.961,01:24:53.505,"Big brother, baby, all the way."
01:24:54.339,01:24:56.841,Which is why we prefer impressions to ideas.
01:24:56.925,01:24:58.426,Situations to subjects.
01:24:58.510,01:25:01.471,Brief lights to sustained ones.
01:25:01.554,01:25:03.223,Exceptions to types.
01:25:04.682,01:25:05.558,And yourself?
01:25:09.896,01:25:10.897,What?
01:25:11.689,01:25:13.942,I'm just lookin' for a room at the moment.
01:26:05.451,01:26:12.417,"that the whole thing is real, all his paranoia has proven horribly true."
01:26:12.500,01:26:14.085,"You mean, no one told you?"
01:26:14.169,01:26:15.003,Nope.
01:26:19.716,01:26:20.592,Why?
01:26:22.177,01:26:23.386,Forgot.
01:26:27.932,01:26:28.933,Jesus.
01:26:29.017,01:26:30.935,"I mean, I knew it was over."
01:26:32.395,01:26:37.984,I just… didn't know it was up to me to make it stop.
01:27:03.635,01:27:04.636,"Hello, Brian."
01:27:21.986,01:27:22.987,These are the papers.
01:27:28.701,01:27:29.786,All you need to do is sign.
01:27:42.382,01:27:43.383,So you won't forget.
01:27:45.510,01:27:47.136,-I already have. -Evidently.
01:27:53.476,01:27:54.727,"Fuck you, Brian!"
01:27:55.603,01:28:01.901,"Did you ever, for one bloody second in your life, want anything more than this?"
01:28:03.111,01:28:03.945,No.
01:28:09.492,01:28:16.416,Your problem… is you get what you want and do what you will.
01:28:20.295,01:28:24.632,There's suffering at the birth of a child as at the birth of a star.
01:28:24.716,01:28:27.844,You live in terror of not being misunderstood.
01:28:27.927,01:28:33.766,"Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders."
01:28:35.727,01:28:37.478,"I lost my girlhood, true."
01:28:42.108,01:28:43.276,But it was for you.
01:28:47.488,01:28:52.118,What in God's name is going on up here? How the fuck did you get in here?
01:28:52.201,01:28:54.704,"-Brian, I am really sorry about that. -That's all right, Shannon."
01:28:55.288,01:28:57.040,Mandy was just leaving.
01:29:00.585,01:29:12.263,"Mandy, if you'd be so kind as to follow me- Let go of me! I am perfectly capable of making my own-- I really don't want to have to call someone."
01:29:16.476,01:29:18.269,Call someone?
01:29:22.190,01:29:24.233,"I am his wife, for fuck's sake!"
01:29:30.198,01:29:31.366,Fuck the lot of you!
01:29:46.089,01:29:50.301,"I saw him again, briefly, a few weeks later at a concert."
01:29:50.968,01:29:51.969,He was performin'?
01:29:59.268,01:30:05.358,"He and Jack Fairy had just finished their Berlin record… and Curt was in London playin' some gigs, and Brian was there."
01:30:05.441,01:30:07.777,For a second. I don't think anyone even saw him.
01:30:12.323,01:30:13.491,Which concert?
01:30:20.540,01:30:26.504,"Uh, it was like a tribute, a sort of farewell concert to glam rock."
01:30:26.587,01:30:37.974,"To save your wild, wild lives, to ne’er your fans embitter, to cease your sad demise, tonight we toast!"
01:31:46.751,01:31:48.085,I don't think you should bother.
01:31:48.169,01:31:51.130,I think I should go on stage tonight instead of you.
01:31:54.342,01:31:56.552,Come on. Come on.
01:31:57.178,01:31:58.179,I'm stuck.
01:32:03.768,01:32:06.646,I'm trapped! I'm being attacked by a bloody porno!
01:33:48.956,01:33:54.879,"Um, and due to the overwhelming demand, there will be additional shows added whenever and wherever possible."
01:33:54.962,01:34:00.092,"Regrettably, Mr. Stone only has time for a few brief questions this morning, as he has a plane to catch to Zurich."
01:34:25.201,01:34:26.202,Lou.
01:34:27.119,01:34:28.120,Lou!
01:34:30.956,01:34:34.627,Lou! Lou! Lou!
01:34:34.710,01:34:35.961,"Sorry, Arthur. I'm late."
01:34:36.045,01:34:37.922,-I think I'm on to something. -What?
01:34:38.005,01:34:40.424,Something quite big. I think I know who Brian Slade is.
01:34:40.508,01:34:42.927,"-Aw, that story's been dropped. -What?"
01:34:43.010,01:34:45.513,-Why? -I need you on the Stone show.
01:34:45.596,01:34:46.639,But that's it!
01:34:48.140,01:34:49.558,What did they say to ya?
01:34:50.810,01:34:51.811,Lou!
01:35:01.237,01:35:03.072,"Um, I was, uh— I was given this number."
01:35:03.155,01:35:05.699,"Uh, I was told I could reach Curt Wild, uh, here."
01:35:13.582,01:35:21.340,"Listen. I don't know who the hell gave you this number, but Curt Wild is not available and not interested in granting you or anyone else an interview on this subject. You got it?"
01:35:22.716,01:39:58.701,I'm sorry. I was told-- -Yeah? -Yeah.
01:39:59.952,01:40:00.786,Thanks.
01:40:05.165,01:40:06.166,"Did you see, uh--?"
01:40:33.777,01:40:41.618,that I see how you patched through my walls… and entered my life… in waves.
01:40:51.920,01:40:52.921,Don't be frightened.
01:40:55.132,01:40:57.634,What's your name? Favorite color?
01:40:58.635,01:41:00.512,Song? Movie?
01:41:02.723,01:41:05.350,Don't be nervous. Are you high?
01:41:06.101,01:41:07.102,I'm on a button.
01:41:17.529,01:41:19.740,I'd followed his signals and slipped away.
01:41:21.158,01:41:33.212,"And now, suddenly… Hey."
01:41:37.633,01:41:38.634,Make a wish.
01:42:18.006,01:42:18.966,Hey.
01:42:34.523,01:42:46.243,"Make a wish… and see yourself… on stage, inside out, tangle of garlands in your hair."
01:42:47.828,01:42:49.830,Of course you are pleasantly surprised.
01:45:58.560,01:46:03.065,The whole thing takes six full-size rigs or three chartered planes to transport.
01:46:05.609,01:46:10.197,"Tommy, over here. Tommy, what's your opinion of the work… that President Reynolds has been doing?"
01:46:12.824,01:46:17.954,"He's a, uh, tremendous leader, a, uh, tremendous spokesperson for the needs of the nation today."
01:46:18.038,01:46:25.796,"Tommy, what's your response to the recent allegations… connectin' you with bisexual pop singer Brian Slade, who staged his own assassination ten years ago in London?"
01:46:25.879,01:46:28.381,"Ladies and gentlemen, that's all that Mr. Stone has time for this evening."
01:46:31.718,01:46:35.889,Get out! Get out! Now! Out!
01:46:39.434,01:46:43.188,"People Rocking People, to sold-out arenas worldwide."
01:47:05.043,01:47:06.044,"Beer, please."
01:47:18.974,01:47:20.433,Are you with the Tommy Stone tour?
01:47:25.480,01:47:28.692,No. Just a journalist.
01:47:31.611,01:47:36.741,"Perhaps you'd like my, uh, press pass as a souvenir."
01:47:38.827,01:47:39.828,"Thanks, sir."
01:47:43.748,01:47:45.584,"Oh, my God. Let me see that."
01:48:13.236,01:48:14.154,You're Curt Wild.
01:48:16.781,01:48:18.992,Yeah. Who the hell are you?
01:48:21.953,01:48:24.539,I'm a journalist from the Herald.
01:48:29.211,01:48:30.420,You were at the concert?
01:48:33.840,01:48:43.099,"It’s just funny, 'cause, uh, I was tryin' to contact you, actually, about a story I was doin' about an old friend of yours."
01:48:45.518,01:48:46.811,Brian Slade.
01:48:50.190,01:48:52.275,I was tryin' to find out what actually happened to him.
01:48:52.359,01:48:57.656,"-Look-- -I mean, before he became… such a mystery."
01:49:00.450,01:49:05.288,"Look, man, I don't know who you've been talkin' to or what you're after here-- What?"
01:49:08.583,01:49:09.584,What?
01:49:11.878,01:49:12.712,Listen.
01:49:12.796,01:49:16.758,"A real artist creates beautiful things, and puts nothing of his own life into them, okay?"
01:49:17.968,01:49:19.761,-Is that what you did? -No.
01:49:22.639,01:49:24.182,We set out to change the world.
01:49:26.685,01:49:28.270,Ended up just changin' ourselves.
01:49:30.730,01:49:31.731,What's wrong with that?
01:49:34.776,01:49:35.610,Nothing.
01:49:37.821,01:49:39.030,If you don't look at the world.
01:50:03.513,01:50:05.223,That's quite a pin you got there.
01:50:06.433,01:50:07.267,"Oh, yeah."
01:50:07.809,01:50:08.810,Is it old?
01:50:09.477,01:50:10.478,Possibly.
01:50:11.354,01:50:12.772,Belonged to Oscar Wilde.
01:50:14.190,01:50:16.276,Or so I was told by the person that gave it to me.
01:50:18.778,01:50:22.532,Friend of mine… who kinda disappeared some years back.
01:50:27.245,01:50:29.289,I forget where we were. We were on a trip.
01:50:30.498,01:50:35.503,"But he said to me, Curt, a man's life is his image."
01:50:48.683,01:50:50.310,Here. Why don't you hang on to it.
01:50:51.102,01:50:52.103,Me?
01:50:52.771,01:50:53.772,Sure. Why not?
01:50:54.481,01:50:56.024,"I've had it too long, anyway."
01:50:57.359,01:50:58.193,Go ahead.
01:51:01.404,01:51:02.238,For your image.
01:51:08.620,01:51:09.454,Really.
01:51:11.331,01:51:12.165,I couldn't.
01:51:15.877,01:51:16.878,But thanks.
01:51:35.313,01:51:36.439,"I'll, uh, see you around."
01:51:36.523,01:51:37.524,Cheers.
01:52:13.268,01:52:15.061,A freedom you can allow yourself.
01:52:19.691,01:52:20.692,Or not.
