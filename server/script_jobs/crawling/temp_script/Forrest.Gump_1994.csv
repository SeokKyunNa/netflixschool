00:03:17.948,00:03:22.202,"Hello. My name's Forrest, Forrest Gump."
00:03:28.333,00:03:29.751,Do you want a chocolate?
00:03:32.838,00:03:35.590,I could eat about a million-and-a-half of these.
00:03:37.551,00:03:42.764,"My mama always said, Life was like a box of chocolates."
00:03:44.850,00:03:47.060,You never know what you're gonna get.
00:03:54.818,00:03:56.862,Those must be comfortable shoes.
00:03:58.864,00:04:02.743,I bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing.
00:04:05.454,00:04:07.956,I wish I had shoes like that.
00:04:08.832,00:04:10.000,My feet hurt.
00:04:13.253,00:04:15.589,you can tell about a person by their shoes.
00:04:17.591,00:04:20.552,"Where they're going, where they've been."
00:04:27.851,00:04:30.103,I've worn lots of shoes.
00:04:32.981,00:04:37.319,I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.
00:04:40.697,00:04:43.283,Mama said they'd take me anywhere.
00:04:44.075,00:04:46.787,She said they was my magic shoes.
00:04:46.912,00:04:49.748,"All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now."
00:04:57.339,00:04:58.965,Let's take a little walk around.
00:05:06.598,00:05:07.808,How do those feel?
00:05:11.436,00:05:15.607,"His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump, as strong as I've ever seen."
00:05:16.274,00:05:19.778,But his back's as crooked as a politician.
00:05:20.821,00:05:23.448,"But we're going to straighten him right up now, aren't we, Forrest?"
00:05:28.787,00:05:32.916,after the great Civil War hero General Nathan Bedford Forrest.
00:05:35.001,00:05:40.841,"in some way. And what he did was, he started up this club called the Ku Klux Klan."
00:05:41.383,00:05:48.974,They'd all dress up in their robes and their bedsheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or somethin'.
00:05:49.349,00:05:52.769,They'd even put bedsheets on their horses and ride around.
00:05:53.270,00:05:57.399,"And, anyway, that's how I got my name, Forrest Gump."
00:05:57.983,00:06:05.824,"Mama said that the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well, just don't make no sense."
00:06:10.537,00:06:13.206,"Just wait, let me get it."
00:06:13.915,00:06:15.000,Give it to me.
00:06:21.423,00:06:22.966,What are y'all starin' at?
00:06:23.300,00:06:26.595,Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before?
00:06:29.097,00:06:32.475,"Don't ever let anybody tell you they're better than you, Forrest."
00:06:32.851,00:06:37.606,"If God intended everybody to be the same, he'd have given us all braces on our legs."
00:06:39.900,00:06:41.818,so I could understand them.
00:06:43.069,00:06:49.451,"We lived about a quarter mile off Route 17, about a half mile from the town of Greenbow, Alabama."
00:06:49.868,00:06:51.536,That's in the county of Greenbow.
00:06:52.704,00:07:00.462,Our house had been in Mama's family since her grandpa's grandpa's grandpa had come across the ocean about a 1000 years ago or somethin' like that.
00:07:01.212,00:07:12.766,"Since it was just me and Mama and we had all these empty rooms, Mama decided to let those rooms out, mostly to people passing through, like from, oh, Mobile, Montgomery, places like that."
00:07:12.891,00:07:15.060,And that's how me and Mama got money.
00:07:15.644,00:07:17.938,Mama was a real smart lady.
00:07:20.565,00:07:22.859,You're no different than anybody else is.
00:07:25.904,00:07:28.156,"Did you hear what I said, Forrest?"
00:07:28.406,00:07:32.744,You're the same as everybody else. You are no different.
00:07:33.119,00:07:37.165,"Your boy's… different, Mrs. Gump."
00:07:37.499,00:07:39.793,"Now, his I.Q. is 75."
00:07:40.627,00:07:43.463,"Well, we're all different, Mr. Hancock."
00:07:50.971,00:07:53.056,to the Greenbow County Central School.
00:07:53.473,00:07:55.266,I met the principal and all.
00:07:59.604,00:08:01.773,"Now, this is normal."
00:08:02.899,00:08:06.194,Forrest is right here.
00:08:07.195,00:08:12.492,"The state requires a minimum I.Q. of 80 to attend public school, Mrs. Gump."
00:08:13.159,00:08:15.537,He's gonna have to go to a special school.
00:08:16.287,00:08:17.998,"Now, he'll be just fine."
00:08:19.082,00:08:30.010,What does normal mean anyway? He might be… a bit on the slow side… but my boy Forrest is gonna get the same opportunities as everyone else.
00:08:30.093,00:08:33.555,He's not going to some special school to learn how to retread tires.
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.850,We're talking about five little points here.
00:08:39.060,00:08:41.396,There must be something that can be done.
00:08:46.568,00:08:48.987,We don't want to see anybody left behind.
00:08:50.238,00:08:53.241,"Is there a Mr. Gump, Mrs. Gump?"
00:08:57.037,00:08:58.413,He's on vacation.
00:09:16.139,00:09:19.267,"Well, your mama sure does care about your schooling, son."
00:09:25.565,00:09:27.650,"You don't say much, do you?"
00:09:39.579,00:09:49.839,"Finally, he had to try. It looked easy, but… -Oh, what happened. First they-- -Mama, what's vacation mean?"
00:09:50.757,00:09:53.384,-Vacation? -Where daddy went?
00:09:56.012,00:10:02.727,Vacation's when you go somewhere… and you don't ever come back.
00:10:12.654,00:10:13.863,But we didn't mind.
00:10:14.531,00:10:19.160,Our house was never empty. There was always folks coming and going.
00:10:19.244,00:10:23.665,"-Supper! It's supper, everyone! Forrest! -My, my, that sure looks special."
00:10:26.376,00:10:36.010,"that every room was filled with travelers, you know, -and hat cases, and sample cases. -I can't find Forrest. Forrest!"
00:10:36.136,00:10:39.347,"Forrest Gump, it's suppertime! Forrest?"
00:10:42.100,00:10:45.687,and he had him a guitar case.
00:10:59.617,00:11:00.618,Forrest.
00:11:01.035,00:11:03.413,"I told you not to bother this nice, young man."
00:11:05.123,00:11:07.333,I… I was showing him a thing or two on the guitar here.
00:11:07.417,00:11:10.712,"Well, all right then. Supper's ready if y'all want to eat."
00:11:14.883,00:11:17.969,"Say, man, show me that crazy little walk you just did there."
00:11:18.386,00:11:19.596,"Slow it down, son."
00:11:28.646,00:11:34.360,"I started moving around to the music, swinging my hips."
00:11:39.908,00:11:43.703,"and we walked by Vincy's furniture and appliance store, and guess what?"
00:12:04.098,00:12:08.937,"who they called the King… well, he sung too many songs."
00:12:09.812,00:12:12.273,Had himself a heart attack or something.
00:12:13.441,00:12:15.401,It must be hard bein' a king.
00:12:19.781,00:12:23.034,"You know, it's funny how you remember some things, but some things you can't."
00:12:23.534,00:12:25.828,"You do your very best now, Forrest."
00:12:37.215,00:12:38.383,Are you coming along?
00:12:38.800,00:12:42.136,Mama said not to be taking rides from strangers.
00:12:42.553,00:12:44.055,This is the bus to school.
00:12:47.642,00:12:49.852,"I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump."
00:12:50.853,00:12:54.691,"-I'm Dorothy Harris. -Well, now we ain't strangers anymore."
00:13:07.870,00:13:09.330,This seat's taken.
00:13:12.000,00:13:13.084,It's taken.
00:13:21.384,00:13:23.011,You can't sit here.
00:13:29.142,00:13:31.185,'cause I don't remember being born.
00:13:32.145,00:13:46.159,"I… I don't recall what I got for my first Christmas, and I don't know when I went on my first outdoor picnic but… I do remember the first time I heard the sweetest voice in the wide world."
00:13:53.791,00:13:55.877,so beautiful in my life.
00:13:56.544,00:13:58.171,She was like an angel.
00:13:58.713,00:14:01.174,"Well, are you gonna sit down or aren't you?"
00:14:06.512,00:14:08.056,What's wrong with your legs?
00:14:08.556,00:14:12.935,"Um, nothing at all, thank you. My legs are just fine and dandy."
00:14:15.813,00:14:17.398,and had a conversation all the way to school.
00:14:17.523,00:14:20.443,My mama says back's crooked like a question mark.
00:14:20.651,00:14:26.574,These are gonna make me… or asked me questions.
00:14:27.367,00:14:28.951,Are you stupid or something?
00:14:29.577,00:14:32.413,"Mama says, Stupid is as stupid does."
00:14:34.082,00:14:34.957,I'm Jenny.
00:14:36.000,00:14:37.794,"I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump."
00:14:40.463,00:14:43.174,Jenny and me was like peas and carrots.
00:14:48.596,00:14:51.224,"Come on, Forrest, you can do it!"
00:14:53.893,00:15:01.067,A good little… and I showed her how to swing.
00:15:03.152,00:15:06.864,"Sometimes, we'd just sit out and wait for the stars."
00:15:09.951,00:15:11.953,Just stay a little longer.
00:15:17.250,00:15:19.168,"Okay, Jenny, I'll stay."
00:15:26.384,00:15:27.718,My only friend.
00:15:31.722,00:15:34.725,Now my mama always told me that miracles happen every day.
00:15:35.601,00:15:38.104,"Some people don't think so, but they do."
00:15:40.940,00:15:42.191,"Hey, dummy!"
00:15:50.575,00:15:53.619,"Run, Forrest! Run away! Hurry!"
00:15:57.123,00:16:01.002,"Come on! Look out, dummy. Here we come. We're going to get you!"
00:16:02.462,00:16:06.424,"Run, Forrest, run! Run, Forrest!"
00:16:08.217,00:16:09.510,"Come back here, you!"
00:16:23.566,00:16:27.528,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
00:17:02.772,00:17:05.107,but I could run like the wind blows.
00:17:08.319,00:17:14.033,"From that day on, if I was going somewhere, I was running."
00:17:47.650,00:17:50.444,That boy sure is a runnin' fool.
00:17:59.328,00:18:02.373,"Well, she lived in a house that was as old as Alabama."
00:18:02.498,00:18:08.087,"Her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five, and her daddy was some kind of a farmer."
00:18:19.682,00:18:24.103,"And then this one time, Jenny wasn't on the bus to go to school."
00:18:25.229,00:18:27.231,"Jenny, why didn't you come to school today?"
00:18:27.315,00:18:29.442,Shh. Daddy's takin' a nap.
00:18:37.450,00:18:39.327,"You better get back here, girl!"
00:18:41.579,00:18:42.622,Where you at?
00:18:52.840,00:18:53.966,Jenny!
00:19:00.514,00:19:03.267,"so I can fly far, far, far away from here."
00:19:03.726,00:19:30.169,"Dear God, make me a bird so I can fly far, he had the police say Jenny didn't have to stay just over on Creekmore Avenue, which made me happy 'cause she was so close."
00:19:36.676,00:19:41.180,and come on over to my house just 'cause she said she was scared.
00:19:47.770,00:19:49.188,He was a mean dog.
00:19:50.231,00:19:54.902,"Anyway, Jenny and me was best friends all the way up through high school."
00:20:05.454,00:20:06.706,Get in the truck! Let's move it!
00:20:07.373,00:20:10.126,Come on! He's getting away! Move it!
00:20:10.292,00:20:12.503,"Run, Forrest! Run!"
00:20:18.092,00:20:20.970,"-Move it, dumbass! -Yeah, you better be running!"
00:20:40.823,00:20:42.533,"Run, Forrest!"
00:20:45.286,00:20:48.664,"Now, it used to be I ran to get where I was going."
00:20:50.499,00:20:52.710,I never thought it would take me anywhere.
00:21:22.072,00:21:23.574,Who in the hell is that?
00:21:23.908,00:21:26.202,"That there is Forrest Gump, coach."
00:21:39.799,00:21:42.426,"Forrest, move it! Run! Run!"
00:21:42.551,00:21:44.136,-Okay! -Run!
00:21:44.345,00:21:47.097,"Run, you stupid son of a bitch! Run!"
00:21:59.902,00:22:02.947,"Run, son of a bitch, run! Go! Run!"
00:22:05.241,00:22:07.743,Run! Run! Go!
00:22:19.088,00:22:38.524,"He must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive, Federal troops enforcing a court order integrated the University of Alabama today."
00:22:39.233,00:22:45.406,Two negroes were admitted but only after Governor George Wallace had carried out his symbolic threat to stand in the schoolhouse door.
00:22:45.489,00:22:52.121,"Governor Wallace, I take it from that, uh, statement that us… Earl, what's going on?"
00:22:52.204,00:22:54.748,-Coons are trying to get into school. -Coons?
00:22:55.457,00:23:01.672,"When raccoons tried getting on our back porch, -Mama just chased them off with a broom. -Not raccoons, you idiot. Niggers."
00:23:02.006,00:23:03.841,And they want to go to school with us.
00:23:04.508,00:23:06.510,With us? They do?
00:23:10.014,00:23:21.025,"to block the doorway, President Kennedy ordered the Secretary of Defense then to use military force. Here, by videotape, is the encounter by General Graham, commander of the National Guard, and Governor Wallace."
00:23:21.567,00:23:31.368,"Because these national guardsmen are here today as federal soldiers for Alabama, and they live within our borders. They are all our brothers."
00:23:32.077,00:23:47.051,"We are winning in this fight, because we are awakening the American people to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times that is so evident today, the trend toward military dictatorship in this country."
00:23:54.224,00:24:14.995,"had been desegregated, and students Jimmy Hood and Vivian Malone had been signed up By being on the Tuscaloosa campus, he kept the mob from gathering… Say, wasn't that Gump?"
00:24:15.788,00:24:17.164,"No, that couldn't be."
00:24:18.165,00:24:20.042,It sure as hell was.
00:24:25.547,00:24:30.803,that angry little man at the schoolhouse door thought it'd be a good idea and ran for president.
00:24:45.484,00:24:46.735,My bus is here.
00:24:47.903,00:24:50.698,"-Is it the number nine? -No, it's the number four."
00:24:51.907,00:24:53.492,It was nice talking to you.
00:24:56.996,00:25:01.083,"I remember when that happened, when Wallace got shot."
00:25:02.042,00:25:03.210,I was in college.
00:25:03.377,00:25:06.797,Did you go to a girls' college or a girls' and boys' together college?
00:25:06.922,00:25:12.594,-It was coed. -'Cause Jenny went to a college I couldn't go to. It was a college just for girls.
00:25:13.137,00:25:15.639,But I'd go and visit her every chance I got.
00:26:05.939,00:26:07.900,Stop it! What are you doing?
00:26:07.983,00:26:09.777,-He was hurting you. -What the hell is going on here?
00:26:09.860,00:26:12.696,"-No, he wasn't! Get over there! -Who is that? Who is that?"
00:26:13.739,00:26:15.824,"-Billy, I'm sorry. -Just get away from me."
00:26:15.949,00:26:18.327,-Don't be such… Don't go. -Get… get… get away from me!
00:26:18.494,00:26:19.995,"Billy, wait a second."
00:26:24.500,00:26:27.044,"Forrest, why'd you do that?"
00:26:30.047,00:26:31.507,I brought you some chocolate.
00:26:33.300,00:26:34.301,I'm sorry.
00:26:37.179,00:26:39.306,I'll go back to my college now.
00:26:39.640,00:26:45.479,Forrest-- Look at you.
00:26:47.856,00:26:48.774,Come on.
00:26:49.441,00:26:50.359,Come on.
00:26:57.658,00:26:59.118,-Is this your own room? -Shh!
00:27:07.501,00:27:08.919,about who you're going to be?
00:27:10.462,00:27:11.588,Who I'm going to be?
00:27:11.713,00:27:13.799,-Yeah. -Aren't… aren't I going to be me?
00:27:14.341,00:27:17.594,"You'll always be you, just another kind of you."
00:27:18.804,00:27:19.680,You know?
00:27:20.764,00:27:22.057,I want to be famous.
00:27:23.809,00:27:26.145,I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
00:27:27.771,00:27:32.943,"I just want to be… on an empty stage with my guitar, my voice."
00:27:34.987,00:27:35.946,Just me.
00:27:38.073,00:27:40.784,And I want to reach people on a personal level.
00:27:43.954,00:27:46.874,"I want to be able to say things, just one to one."
00:27:55.132,00:27:57.134,"Have you ever been with a girl, Forrest?"
00:27:59.178,00:28:02.764,I sit next to them in my home economics class all the time.
00:28:40.761,00:28:41.678,Oh.
00:28:42.930,00:28:43.889,It's all right.
00:28:58.445,00:29:00.822,I'll bet that never happened in home ec.
00:29:13.418,00:29:16.505,I think I ruined your roommate's bathrobe.
00:29:25.138,00:29:30.352,Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Stop!
00:29:38.694,00:29:45.993,They even put me on a thing called the all-America team where you get to meet the President of the United States.
00:29:47.869,00:29:51.081,All-American football team at the Oval Office today.
00:29:54.710,00:29:57.504,of the United States is the food.
00:29:57.921,00:30:02.509,They put you in this little room with just about anything you'd want to eat or drink.
00:30:03.635,00:30:12.477,"But since, number one, I wasn't hungry but thirsty, and number two, they was free, I must have drank me about 15 Dr Peppers."
00:30:24.531,00:30:27.200,Congratulations! How does it feel to be an All-American?
00:30:29.119,00:30:30.871,Congratulations. How do you feel?
00:30:31.413,00:30:32.664,I got to pee.
00:30:53.810,00:30:58.231,somebody shot that nice young president when he was riding in his car.
00:30:59.316,00:31:05.739,"And a few years after that, somebody shot his little brother, too, only he was in a hotel kitchen."
00:31:07.282,00:31:09.034,Must be hard being brothers.
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.120,I wouldn't know.
00:31:12.412,00:31:13.872,Forrest Gump.
00:31:15.374,00:31:19.294,"After only five years of playing football, I got a college degree."
00:31:19.378,00:31:21.296,"Congratulations, son."
00:31:25.425,00:31:29.304,"Forrest, I'm so proud of you. Here, I'll hold this for you."
00:31:29.429,00:31:31.390,"Congratulations, son."
00:31:31.640,00:31:34.059,Have you given any thought to your future?
00:31:36.436,00:31:37.562,Thought?
00:31:39.147,00:31:41.066,Hello. I'm Forrest. Forrest Gump.
00:31:41.191,00:31:44.194,"Nobody gives a horse's shit who you are, pus ball!"
00:31:44.361,00:31:46.905,"You're not even a lowlife, scum-sucking maggot!"
00:31:46.988,00:31:49.991,Get your faggoty ass on the bus! You're in the army now!
00:31:55.080,00:31:55.997,Taken.
00:32:02.087,00:32:05.924,"Seeing how it was only my induction day, and I was getting yelled at."
00:32:10.053,00:32:11.847,You can sit down if you want to.
00:32:16.309,00:32:18.603,You ever been on a real shrimp boat?
00:32:19.521,00:32:20.564,No.
00:32:21.106,00:32:23.108,But I been on a real big boat.
00:32:23.900,00:32:26.319,I'm talking about a shrimp catching boat.
00:32:26.820,00:32:29.197,I been working on shrimp boats all my life.
00:32:29.364,00:32:32.367,"I started out on my uncle's boat, that's my mama's brother."
00:32:32.492,00:32:34.035,when I was about maybe nine.
00:32:34.619,00:32:37.956,I was just looking into buying of my own boat and got drafted.
00:32:39.291,00:32:42.377,My given name is Benjamin Buford Blue.
00:32:42.794,00:32:48.300,"People call me Bubba, just like one of them old redneck boys. Can you believe that?"
00:32:48.967,00:32:52.512,My name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump.
00:32:55.932,00:32:57.767,and his mama cooked shrimp.
00:33:00.020,00:33:05.650,"And her mama before her cooked shrimp, and her mama before her mama cooked shrimp too."
00:33:05.984,00:33:09.863,Bubba's family knew everything there was to know about the shrimping business.
00:33:10.071,00:33:12.991,I know everything there is to know about the shrimping business.
00:33:13.200,00:33:17.913,"As a matter of fact, I'm going into the shrimping business for myself after I get out of the army."
00:33:21.583,00:33:22.459,Okay.
00:33:22.542,00:33:23.668,Gump!
00:33:23.919,00:33:26.630,What's your sole purpose in this army?
00:33:26.755,00:33:29.341,"To do whatever you tell me, drill sergeant!"
00:33:29.466,00:33:32.761,"Goddammit, Gump, you're a goddamn genius!"
00:33:32.886,00:33:35.222,That's the most outstanding answer I've ever heard.
00:33:35.347,00:33:40.685,"You must have a goddamn I.Q. of 160. You are goddamn gifted, Private Gump."
00:33:42.229,00:33:43.480,"Listen up, people!"
00:33:46.191,00:33:48.193,like one of them round pegs.
00:33:48.360,00:33:49.736,It's not really hard.
00:33:49.945,00:33:57.661,"You just make your bed real neat, and remember to stand up straight, and always answer every question with, Yes, drill sergeant."
00:34:01.873,00:34:04.584,What you do is drag your nets along the bottom.
00:34:04.876,00:34:08.338,"On a good day, you can catch over a 100 pounds of shrimp."
00:34:08.964,00:34:16.388,"Everything goes all right, two men shrimping ten hours, less what you spends on gas-- Done, drill sergeant!"
00:34:17.013,00:34:18.265,Gump!
00:34:20.225,00:34:22.894,"Why did you put that weapon together so quickly, Gump?"
00:34:23.478,00:34:26.356,"-You told me to, drill sergeant. -Jesus H. Christ."
00:34:26.773,00:34:28.358,This is a new company record.
00:34:28.608,00:34:33.446,"If it wouldn't be a waste of such a damn fine enlisted man, I'd recommend you for O.C.S., Private Gump."
00:34:33.530,00:34:37.325,"You are gonna be a general someday, Gump! Now disassemble your weapon and continue!"
00:34:40.579,00:34:44.124,"Anyway, like I was sayin', shrimp is the fruit of the sea."
00:34:44.666,00:34:49.254,"You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, sauté it."
00:34:49.504,00:34:57.637,"There's, uh, shrimp kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo, pan fried, deep fried, stir fried."
00:34:58.013,00:35:13.028,"There's pineapple shrimp and lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich."
00:35:15.947,00:35:17.365,That… that's about it.
00:35:25.832,00:35:32.547,"We'd lay there in our bunks and I'd miss my mama, and I'd miss Jenny."
00:35:36.468,00:35:37.510,"Hey, Gump."
00:35:38.219,00:35:40.180,Get a load of the tits on her.
00:35:57.072,00:35:59.991,over some photos of her in her college sweater.
00:36:00.450,00:36:02.243,And she was thrown out of school.
00:36:08.833,00:36:17.634,"'cause a man who owns a theater in Memphis, Tennessee, saw those photos and offered Jenny a job singing in a show."
00:36:18.343,00:36:24.015,"The first chance I got, I took the bus up to Memphis to see her perform in that show."
00:36:24.099,00:36:27.936,"That was Amber, Amber Flame. Give her a big hand, guys! Good job, Amber!"
00:36:28.186,00:36:34.818,"And now, for your listening and viewing pleasure, direct from Hollywood, California, our very own beatnik beauty."
00:36:34.943,00:36:38.154,Let's give a big round of applause to the luscious Bobbie Dylan.
00:37:44.929,00:37:47.891,Shut up yourselves! Just shut up!
00:37:51.102,00:37:53.062,Forrest! What are you doing here?
00:37:53.855,00:37:54.898,What are you doing?
00:38:04.824,00:38:06.826,"You can't keep doing this, Forrest."
00:38:06.910,00:38:09.078,You can't keep trying to rescue me all the time.
00:38:09.204,00:38:10.830,They was trying to grab you.
00:38:13.875,00:38:17.212,Just-- You can't keep doing this all the time.
00:38:17.962,00:38:20.924,I can't help it. I love you.
00:38:32.560,00:38:35.146,"You remember that time we prayed, Forrest?"
00:38:36.397,00:38:40.652,"We prayed for God to turn me into a bird so I could fly far, far away."
00:38:43.029,00:38:44.030,"Yes, I do."
00:38:48.284,00:38:50.745,You think I could fly off this bridge?
00:38:57.794,00:38:59.879,"What do you mean, Jenny?"
00:39:03.967,00:39:04.884,Nothing.
00:39:13.810,00:39:17.355,"Forrest, you stay away from me, okay? You just stay away from me, please."
00:39:18.439,00:39:19.357,Can I have a ride?
00:39:27.240,00:39:29.534,They sending me to Vietnam.
00:39:32.203,00:39:33.997,It's this whole other country.
00:39:37.166,00:39:38.459,Just hang on a minute.
00:39:40.503,00:39:42.589,"Listen, you promise me something, okay?"
00:39:43.673,00:39:45.633,"Just-- If you're ever in trouble, don't try to be brave."
00:39:45.717,00:39:48.261,"You just run, okay? Just run away."
00:39:49.762,00:39:50.638,Okay.
00:39:56.185,00:39:57.228,Jenny.
00:39:59.355,00:40:00.899,I'll write you all the time.
00:40:26.591,00:40:27.675,Oh.
00:40:29.844,00:40:31.471,You come back safe to me.
00:40:32.388,00:40:33.473,Do you hear?
00:41:20.561,00:41:22.981,from the United States of America.
00:41:23.856,00:41:28.778,"Except for all the beer cans and the barbecues, it was."
00:41:38.997,00:41:41.332,"Hey, I'll bet there's shrimp all in these waters."
00:41:41.916,00:41:44.168,They tell me these Vietnams is good shrimp.
00:41:45.253,00:41:53.970,"After we win this war and we take over everything, we can get American shrimpers to come out here and shrimp these waters. And just shrimp all the time, man."
00:41:57.390,00:41:58.891,You must be my FNG's.
00:42:00.685,00:42:03.354,"Oh, get your hands down. Do not salute me."
00:42:03.479,00:42:07.442,There are goddamn snipers all around this area who'd love to grease an officer.
00:42:08.693,00:42:11.279,I'm Lieutenant Dan Taylor. Welcome to fort platoon.
00:42:13.031,00:42:14.365,What's wrong with your lip?
00:42:15.575,00:42:19.996,"-I was born with big gums, sir. -Yeah? Well, you better tuck that in."
00:42:20.079,00:42:21.998,Gonna get that caught on a trip wire.
00:42:23.791,00:42:25.209,Where are you boys from in the world?
00:42:28.504,00:42:30.173,You twins?
00:42:31.966,00:42:34.177,"No. We are not relations, sir."
00:42:36.804,00:42:39.599,"Look, it's pretty basic here."
00:42:40.475,00:42:45.188,"You stick with me and learn from the guys who've been in country a while, you'll be all right."
00:42:45.772,00:42:54.947,"There is one item of GI gear that can be the difference between a live grunt and a dead grunt… socks. Cushioned sole, OD green."
00:42:55.239,00:43:00.536,"Try and keep your feet dry. And when we're out humpin', I want you boys to remember to change your socks whenever we stop."
00:43:00.953,00:43:03.623,The Mekong will eat a grunt's feet right off his legs.
00:43:03.956,00:43:07.752,"Sergeant Sims. Goddammit, where's that sling rope I said to order?"
00:43:07.835,00:43:16.969,"I put in the requisitions at battalion… Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you call those sons of bitches… I felt real lucky he was my lieutenant."
00:43:17.678,00:43:20.932,"He was from a long, great military tradition."
00:43:21.307,00:43:29.482,Somebody in his family had fought and died… in every… single… American war.
00:43:30.525,00:43:32.485,"-Goddammit, kick some ass. -I'm on it, lieutenant."
00:43:32.652,00:43:33.611,Get on it!
00:43:38.783,00:43:43.371,"So, you boys from Arkansas, huh? Well… I been through there."
00:43:43.913,00:43:45.581,Little Rock's a fine town.
00:43:46.791,00:43:48.668,"Now, go shake down your gear."
00:43:49.252,00:43:52.296,See the platoon sergeant. Draw what you need for the field.
00:43:52.964,00:43:55.758,"If you boys are hungry, we got steaks burning right over here."
00:43:56.968,00:44:02.390,"Two standing orders in this platoon-- One, take good care of your feet."
00:44:02.723,00:44:07.645,"Two, try not to do anything stupid, like getting yourself killed."
00:44:14.193,00:44:16.445,I sure hope I don't let him down.
00:44:30.710,00:44:32.962,We would take these real long walks.
00:45:00.656,00:45:12.210,"Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock or a trail or the road, Get down! Shut up!"
00:45:32.313,00:45:38.110,"Now I don't know much about anything, but I think some of America's best young men served in this war."
00:45:38.444,00:45:40.738,There was Dallas from Phoenix.
00:45:42.865,00:45:45.534,"Cleveland, he was from Detroit."
00:45:47.411,00:45:49.830,"Hey, Tex. Man, what the hell's going on?"
00:45:52.625,00:45:54.961,"Well, I don't remember where Tex come from."
00:46:00.633,00:46:02.134,"Fourth platoon, on your feet."
00:46:03.052,00:46:05.263,Y'all got ten clicks to go to that river.
00:46:05.972,00:46:06.847,Move out.
00:46:12.353,00:46:13.312,Look alive out there.
00:46:17.817,00:46:18.901,Fire in the hole!
00:46:22.822,00:46:24.365,"Gump, check out that hole."
00:46:43.009,00:46:59.567,"We've been through every kind of rain there is, little bitty stinging rain… and big ol' fat rain, rain that flew in sideways, and sometimes rain even seemed to come straight up from underneath."
00:47:01.068,00:47:03.571,"Shoot, it even rained at night."
00:47:06.949,00:47:10.077,I'm gon' to lean up against you. You lean your back against me.
00:47:10.369,00:47:13.956,This way we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud.
00:47:15.041,00:47:17.793,"You know why we're a good partnership, Forrest?"
00:47:18.753,00:47:22.631,"'cause we be watching out for one another, like brothers and stuff."
00:47:25.134,00:47:28.054,"Hey, Forrest, somethin' I been thinking about."
00:47:28.971,00:47:31.557,I got a very important question to ask you.
00:47:33.517,00:47:36.604,How would you like to go into the shrimping business with me?
00:47:38.773,00:47:39.857,Okay.
00:47:40.483,00:47:43.444,"Man, I tell you what. I got it all figured out, too."
00:47:43.944,00:47:46.405,So many pounds of shrimp will pay off the boat.
00:47:46.614,00:47:48.324,So many pounds for gas.
00:47:48.616,00:47:51.911,We can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent.
00:47:52.620,00:47:58.751,"I'll be the captain. We can just work it together, split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm telling you, 50-50."
00:47:59.126,00:48:02.588,"And hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can eat."
00:48:04.215,00:48:06.092,That's a fine idea.
00:48:16.852,00:48:20.064,"I sent her letters. Not every day, but almost."
00:48:20.314,00:48:27.947,I told her what I was doin' and asked her what she was doin' and told her how I thought about her always.
00:48:29.490,00:48:46.215,"And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her Then I'd sign each letter Love, Forrest Gump."
00:49:04.567,00:49:11.991,"and then, just like that, somebody turned off the rain, and the sun come out."
00:49:17.246,00:49:18.706,Take cover!
00:49:35.347,00:49:37.892,"Strongarm, Strongarm!"
00:49:38.809,00:49:40.853,"Hey, Dan! We got a man down!"
00:49:44.899,00:49:51.655,"Roger, Strongarm! Be advised we have incoming from the tree line at point blue plus two! A.K.s and rockets!"
00:49:59.455,00:50:02.875,Get that pig unfucked and on the tree line!
00:50:05.252,00:50:07.505,"They got us, and it hurt."
00:50:07.755,00:50:11.050,We're going to move 'em back to the blue line.
00:50:11.967,00:50:14.011,Pull back! Pull back!
00:50:14.386,00:50:16.138,"Forrest! Run, Forrest!"
00:50:16.222,00:50:20.017,"-Pull back! -Run! Run! Run, man!"
00:50:25.064,00:50:29.610,"Run, goddammit! Run! Get the hell out of here!"
00:51:00.266,00:51:06.105,"I ran so far so fast that pretty soon I was all by myself, which was a bad thing."
00:51:06.981,00:51:07.940,Bubba.
00:51:24.039,00:51:25.541,Where the hell are you?
00:51:26.625,00:51:27.585,Bubba!
00:51:29.086,00:51:34.383,"And on my way back to find Bubba, well, there was this boy laying on the ground."
00:51:34.550,00:51:35.426,Tex.
00:51:37.928,00:51:38.929,Okay.
00:52:04.622,00:52:08.250,"somebody else was saying, Help me, Forrest, help me!"
00:52:15.841,00:52:17.885,Okay. Here. Here.
00:52:19.637,00:52:23.015,"Don't sweat, man. Just lay back. You'll be okay. You'll be okay."
00:52:25.934,00:52:29.521,I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba.
00:52:31.023,00:52:33.734,I know my position is danger close!
00:52:33.817,00:52:35.694,We got Charlie all over this area.
00:52:35.778,00:52:38.781,I got to have those fast movers in here now. Over.
00:52:41.617,00:52:45.329,I know he's dead! My whole goddamn platoon is wiped out!
00:52:48.374,00:52:49.416,What are you doing?
00:52:50.084,00:52:53.545,You leave me here! Get away. Just leave me here! Get out!
00:53:01.303,00:53:03.972,Be advised your fast movers are inbound at this time. Over.
00:53:16.694,00:53:18.862,You dang son of a bitch!
00:53:19.571,00:53:20.572,Aah!
00:53:21.407,00:53:25.786,"I can't leave the platoon. I told you to leave me there, Gump."
00:53:28.706,00:53:30.332,Did you hear what I said?
00:53:31.291,00:53:33.419,"Gump, damn it, put me down."
00:53:39.216,00:53:44.763,"I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, god damn, you-- -Where the hell do you think you're going? -To get Bubba."
00:53:46.473,00:53:48.142,They're gonna nape the whole area.
00:53:48.684,00:53:51.353,"Gump, you stay here! Goddammit! That's an order."
00:53:51.437,00:53:53.772,I gotta find Bubba!
00:54:09.663,00:54:10.706,Forrest.
00:54:18.922,00:54:21.467,"-Bubba. -I'm okay, Forrest."
00:54:22.342,00:54:23.343,I'm okay.
00:55:40.587,00:55:45.676,"the last time me and Bubba was gonna talk, I'd of thought of something better to say."
00:55:45.759,00:55:46.802,"Hey, Bubba."
00:55:51.932,00:55:55.727,Forrest… why did this happen?
00:56:00.107,00:56:04.236,Then Bubba said something I won't ever forget.
00:56:04.903,00:56:06.697,I want to go home.
00:56:11.827,00:56:15.414,And even I know that ain't something you can find just around the corner.
00:56:16.498,00:56:23.881,"Bubba was gonna be a shrimping boat captain, but instead, he died right there by that river in Vietnam."
00:56:29.511,00:56:31.805,That's all I have to say about that.
00:56:33.932,00:56:35.517,"It was a bullet, wasn't it?"
00:56:38.312,00:56:39.354,A bullet?
00:56:39.646,00:56:41.148,That jumped up and bit you.
00:56:43.483,00:56:45.694,"Oh. Yes, sir."
00:56:45.819,00:56:47.738,Bit me directly in the buttocks.
00:56:48.739,00:56:56.663,They said it was a million-dollar wound but… the Army must keep that money 'cause I still ain't seen a nickel of that million dollars.
00:56:58.707,00:57:03.629,The only good thing about being wounded in the buttocks is the ice cream.
00:57:04.463,00:57:06.965,They gave me all the ice cream I could eat.
00:57:07.215,00:57:11.011,And guess what? A good friend of mine was in the bed right next door.
00:57:13.889,00:57:16.808,"Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice cream."
00:57:19.269,00:57:21.438,"Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!"
00:57:44.002,00:57:45.003,Harper!
00:57:50.300,00:57:51.218,Larson.
00:57:53.220,00:57:54.221,Webster.
00:57:55.973,00:57:56.974,Gump.
00:57:57.724,00:57:59.434,-Gump! -I'm Forrest Gump.
00:58:05.774,00:58:06.900,Nichols.
00:58:08.235,00:58:09.361,Mcmill.
00:58:11.071,00:58:12.114,Johnson.
00:58:29.631,00:58:33.802,"Gump, how can you watch that stupid shit? Turn it off."
00:58:37.139,00:58:39.224,"This is Channel 6, Saigon."
00:58:45.939,00:58:47.065,You know how to play this?
00:58:49.234,00:58:51.653,Come on. Let me show you. Here.
00:58:53.530,00:59:01.872,"Now, the secret to this game is, no matter what happens, never, ever… take your eye off the ball."
00:59:05.375,00:59:06.334,All right.
00:59:13.967,00:59:16.344,See? Any idiot can play.
00:59:21.308,00:59:25.896,I played ping-pong even when I didn't have anyone to play ping-pong with.
00:59:39.034,00:59:40.160,whatever that means.
00:59:40.952,00:59:43.872,Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.
00:59:49.920,00:59:54.091,"I played ping-pong so much, I even played it in my sleep."
01:00:06.728,01:00:09.272,Nothing just happens. It's all part of a plan!
01:00:09.856,01:00:18.532,"I should have died out there with my men, but now I'm nothing but a goddamn cripple, a legless freak!"
01:00:18.657,01:00:20.325,Look. Look! Look at me!
01:00:21.409,01:00:26.248,You see that? Do you know what it's like not to be able to use your legs?
01:00:28.792,01:00:31.044,"W… y… y… yes, sir, I do."
01:00:37.843,01:00:38.885,You cheated me!
01:00:39.761,01:00:44.516,I had a destiny. I was supposed to die in the field with honor!
01:00:44.683,01:00:49.229,"That was my destiny, and you… cheated me out of it!"
01:00:58.697,01:01:00.824,"Do you understand what I'm saying, Gump?"
01:01:03.535,01:01:07.247,This wasn't supposed to happen-- Not to me.
01:01:13.128,01:01:17.757,I was… Lieutenant… Dan Taylor.
01:01:49.414,01:01:50.373,Look at me.
01:01:57.839,01:01:59.382,What am I gonna do now?
01:02:10.143,01:02:11.144,PFC Gump?
01:02:13.146,01:02:14.231,"Yes, sir!"
01:02:15.232,01:02:16.233,As you were.
01:02:17.275,01:02:20.987,"Son, you been awarded the Medal of Honor."
01:02:22.072,01:02:33.458,"Guess what, Lieutenant Dan. They want to give me a Med-- Ma'am."
01:02:34.584,01:02:36.503,What'd they do with Lieutenant Dan?
01:02:37.087,01:02:38.255,They sent him home.
01:02:48.848,01:02:55.897,The ceremony was kicked off with a candid speech by the president regarding the need for further escalation of the war in Vietnam.
01:02:55.981,01:02:59.943,President Johnson awarded four Medals of Honor to men from each of the armed services.
01:03:00.026,01:03:02.570,"America owes you a debt of gratitude, son."
01:03:04.823,01:03:08.159,I understand you were wounded. Where were you hit?
01:03:08.451,01:03:10.036,"In the buttocks, sir."
01:03:36.604,01:03:40.025,so I went out for a walk to see our nation's capital.
01:03:41.860,01:03:44.738,What do you want me to do with them? What are you doing here so late?
01:03:47.615,01:03:55.165,"'cause the streets was awful crowded with people lookin' at all the statues and monuments, and some of them people were loud and pushy."
01:03:55.290,01:03:58.376,"Okay, follow me! Come on, let's move it out!"
01:04:20.315,01:04:23.985,"Hey, you're a good man for doing this. Good."
01:04:24.861,01:04:25.820,Okay.
01:04:30.200,01:04:33.745,"And for some reason, he was wearing an American flag for a shirt."
01:04:41.836,01:04:46.716,"And every time he said the F word, people, for some reason, well, they cheered."
01:04:54.015,01:04:56.184,"Come on, man. Come up here, man."
01:04:56.309,01:04:59.938,"Come on. Come on. Yeah, you! Come on. Move, move!"
01:05:01.606,01:05:03.441,Go on. Let's get up there. Go on.
01:05:17.330,01:05:19.624,"Tell us a little bit about the war, man."
01:05:20.041,01:05:21.334,The war in Vietnam?
01:05:21.793,01:05:24.671,The war in Viet-fucking-Nam!
01:05:50.280,01:05:59.998,Well… There's only one thing I can say about… the war in Vietnam.
01:06:03.626,01:06:20.351,"In Vietnam… -What the hell are you do-- -I'll beat your head in, you goddamn oinker!"
01:06:21.144,01:06:23.313,Jesus Christ! What'd did they do with this?
01:06:36.159,01:06:37.076,That's it.
01:06:38.453,01:06:41.289,And that's all I have to say about that.
01:06:48.755,01:06:51.382,"That's so right on, man. You said it all."
01:06:53.426,01:06:54.677,"What's your name, man?"
01:06:55.845,01:06:58.056,My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.
01:06:59.432,01:07:00.475,Forrest Gump.
01:07:00.558,01:07:02.352,-Gump! -Gump!
01:07:03.520,01:07:05.730,Forrest!
01:07:11.569,01:07:12.570,Jenny!
01:07:30.672,01:07:31.673,Hey!
01:07:53.319,01:07:55.488,and even introduced me to some of her new friends.
01:07:55.572,01:07:59.450,"Shut that blind, man! And get your white ass away from that window."
01:07:59.617,01:08:01.327,Don't you know we in a war here?
01:08:02.453,01:08:04.205,"Hey, man. He's cool. He's one of us."
01:08:04.289,01:08:06.040,-Let me tell you about us. -Where the hell have you been?
01:08:06.165,01:08:15.091,"Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our black leaders, rape our women, and destroy our black communities."
01:08:16.134,01:08:18.469,"Come on here, man. Talk to this guy, would you?"
01:08:18.595,01:08:19.846,Who's the baby killer?
01:08:20.513,01:08:22.890,This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump.
01:08:23.182,01:08:24.726,"Forrest, this is Wesley."
01:08:25.018,01:08:29.147,"Wesley and I lived together in Berkeley, and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of SDS."
01:08:29.272,01:08:38.740,"Let me tell you something else. We are here to offer protection and help for all those who need our help, because we, the black panthers, are against the war in Vietnam."
01:08:38.865,01:08:44.579,Yes. We are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them.
01:08:44.662,01:08:50.918,Yes. We are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities.
01:08:51.085,01:08:52.670,as they sleep in their beds at night.
01:08:52.795,01:08:55.882,"Yes, we are against these racist and imperial dog acts."
01:09:11.731,01:09:12.815,Forrest!
01:09:24.410,01:09:25.953,I shouldn't have brought you here.
01:09:26.537,01:09:29.415,I should have known it was gonna be some bullshit hassle!
01:09:31.501,01:09:33.836,"He should not be hitting you, Jenny."
01:09:38.883,01:09:39.926,"Come on, Forrest."
01:09:46.432,01:09:49.769,Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.
01:09:53.106,01:09:55.566,He doesn't mean it when he does things like this. He doesn't.
01:09:55.733,01:09:57.777,"I would never hurt you, Jenny."
01:09:59.779,01:10:01.406,"I know you wouldn't, Forrest."
01:10:04.158,01:10:06.869,I wanted to be your boyfriend.
01:10:17.255,01:10:19.424,"That uniform is a trip, Forrest."
01:10:21.134,01:10:22.427,You look handsome in it.
01:10:23.344,01:10:24.387,You do.
01:10:28.182,01:10:29.767,-You know what? -What?
01:10:33.813,01:10:36.816,I'm glad we were here together in our nation's capital.
01:10:39.068,01:10:40.361,"Me, too, Forrest."
01:10:44.490,01:10:45.700,just talkin'.
01:10:51.080,01:11:03.634,"and how she discovered ways to expand her mind and learn how to live in harmony… which must be out west somewhere, 'cause she made it all the way to California."
01:11:07.889,01:11:09.766,Anybody wanna go to San Francisco?
01:11:10.725,01:11:12.685,-I'll go. -Far out!
01:11:18.733,01:11:20.651,I didn't want it to end.
01:11:21.778,01:11:23.404,"Wish you wouldn't go, Jenny."
01:11:25.114,01:11:26.449,"I have to, Forrest."
01:11:28.034,01:11:28.951,Jenny?
01:11:31.204,01:11:32.914,Things got a little out of hand.
01:11:33.164,01:11:46.844,It's… it's just this war and that… that lying son of a bitch Johnson and-- Know what I think?
01:12:04.612,01:12:09.534,"Forrest, we have very different lives, you know."
01:12:19.168,01:12:22.463,I want you… to have this.
01:12:26.926,01:12:28.511,"Forrest, I can't keep this."
01:12:30.847,01:12:35.351,I got it… just by d… doing what you told me to do.
01:12:37.061,01:12:38.479,Why are you so good to me?
01:12:40.857,01:12:41.941,You're my girl.
01:12:44.318,01:12:45.778,I'll always be your girl.
01:13:28.654,01:13:31.949,she was gone out of my life again.
01:13:48.591,01:13:53.429,but instead they decided the best way for me to fight the communists was to play ping-pong.
01:13:53.763,01:14:01.312,"So, I was in the special services, traveling around the country, cheering up wounded veterans and showing 'em how to play ping-pong."
01:14:01.979,01:14:07.318,"I was so good that some years later, the Army decided I should be on the All-American ping-pong team."
01:14:08.402,01:14:12.949,"We were the first Americans to visit the land of China in, like, a million years or something like that."
01:14:13.449,01:14:18.871,"Somebody said world peace was in our hands, but all I did was play ping-pong."
01:14:21.248,01:14:22.792,…I was a national celebrity.
01:14:23.501,01:14:25.795,Famouser even than Captain Kangaroo.
01:14:25.920,01:14:28.297,"Eh. Here he is, Forrest Gump. Right here."
01:14:35.262,01:14:37.139,"Mr. Gump, have a seat."
01:14:39.517,01:14:41.143,"Forrest Gump, John Lennon."
01:14:42.228,01:14:43.688,-Welcome home. -You had quite a trip.
01:14:43.771,01:14:47.358,"Can you tell us, um, what was China like?"
01:14:50.361,01:14:55.324,In the land of China… people hardly got nothin' at all.
01:14:59.745,01:15:03.165,"And in China, th… they never go to church."
01:15:04.250,01:15:06.502,"-No religion, too? -Oh."
01:15:07.920,01:15:09.130,Hard to imagine.
01:15:09.463,01:15:11.257,"Well, it's easy if you try, Dick."
01:15:15.511,01:15:20.683,was on his way home to see his little boy and was signing some autographs.
01:15:21.350,01:15:25.062,"For no particular reason at all, somebody shot him."
01:15:28.399,01:15:32.194,They gave you… the Congressional Medal of Honor.
01:15:33.529,01:15:35.031,"Now, that's Lieutenant Dan."
01:15:40.119,01:15:44.623,They gave you… the Congressional Medal of Honor.
01:15:46.417,01:15:47.960,"Yes, sir. They surely did."
01:15:50.046,01:16:01.474,"an imbecile, a moron who goes on television and makes a fool out of himself in front of the whole damn country, the Congressional Medal of Honor."
01:16:02.892,01:16:03.768,"Yes, sir."
01:16:06.187,01:16:08.898,Well… that… that's just perfect!
01:16:11.067,01:16:15.738,"Yeah, well, I just got one thing to say to that-- Goddamn bless America."
01:16:18.657,01:16:21.243,"Whoa-- Oh, god, whoa!"
01:16:29.919,01:16:35.257,"and because he didn't have no legs, he spent most of his time exercising his arms."
01:16:48.604,01:16:51.023,I'm living off the government tit.
01:16:54.235,01:16:55.653,"Hey, hey, hey, are you blind?"
01:16:55.736,01:16:57.071,Why don't you go home before you kill yourself?
01:16:57.154,01:16:58.197,-I'm walking here! -Get out of the way!
01:16:58.322,01:16:59.448,"Ah, get out!"
01:16:59.698,01:17:01.325,"Come on. Go, go, go!"
01:17:15.798,01:17:18.676,"You have a great year, and hurry home. God bless you."
01:17:22.429,01:17:25.057,"Have you found Jesus yet, Gump?"
01:17:26.725,01:17:28.894,"I didn't know I was supposed to be looking for him, sir."
01:17:37.027,01:17:42.700,"That's all these cripples down at the V.A., that's all they ever talk about."
01:17:48.372,01:17:50.791,Have I found Jesus?
01:17:51.417,01:17:54.753,They even had a priest come and talk to me.
01:17:55.296,01:18:00.176,"He said God is listening, but I have to help myself."
01:18:01.177,01:18:08.100,"Now, if I accept Jesus into my heart, I'll get to walk beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven."
01:18:08.517,01:18:09.935,Did you hear what I said?
01:18:11.812,01:18:15.774,Walk… beside him in the Kingdom of Heaven.
01:18:15.900,01:18:20.362,"Well, kiss my crippled ass. God is listening?"
01:18:21.113,01:18:22.448,What a crock of shit!
01:18:26.076,01:18:27.995,"I'm going to Heaven, Lieutenant Dan."
01:18:30.539,01:18:31.457,Oh?
01:18:36.253,01:18:46.597,"Well… before you go… why don't you get your ass down to the corner -and get us more Ripple? -Yes, sir."
01:18:46.805,01:18:51.852,We're at approximately 45th street in New York City at One Astor Plaza.
01:18:51.977,01:18:53.687,This is the site of the old Astor Hotel.
01:19:02.780,01:19:09.912,"soon as I have some money. I made me a promise to Bubba in Vietnam, that as soon as the war was over, we'd go in partners."
01:19:10.037,01:19:13.332,He'd be the captain of the shrimpin' boat and I'd be his first mate.
01:19:13.499,01:19:16.502,"But now that he's dead, I… that means I got to be the captain."
01:19:16.961,01:19:18.420,A shrimp boat captain?
01:19:18.754,01:19:21.882,"Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, Lieutenant Dan."
01:19:31.767,01:19:43.904,"Well, I tell you what, Gilligan. The day that you are a shrimp boat captain, If you're ever a shrimp boat captain, that's the day I'm an astronaut!"
01:19:46.657,01:19:49.451,"-Danny, how you doing, huh? -Mr. Hot Wheels!"
01:19:49.743,01:19:52.788,-Who's your friend? -My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump.
01:19:56.542,01:19:58.002,and Long-Limbs Lenore.
01:19:59.586,01:20:02.715,"So, where you been, babycakes, huh? Haven't seen you around lately."
01:20:02.840,01:20:07.303,"You know, you should have been here for Christmas, cause Tommy bought a round on the house and gave everybody a turkey sandwich."
01:20:07.386,01:20:10.514,"Well, well, I had, uh… company."
01:20:11.140,01:20:14.977,"Hey! Hey, we was… we was just there! There, look, Times Square."
01:20:15.477,01:20:17.604,Don't you just love New Year's?
01:20:17.938,01:20:20.357,"-You can start all over. -Hey, Lenore."
01:20:20.482,01:20:22.359,Everybody gets a second chance.
01:20:25.821,01:21:03.067,"I began to think about Jenny, five, four, three, two, one!"
01:21:22.461,01:21:24.671,"Happy new year, Lieutenant Dan!"
01:21:59.748,01:22:02.000,"Oh! What are you, stupid or something?"
01:22:02.584,01:22:03.752,What's your problem?
01:22:06.171,01:22:08.465,Did… did you lose your pecker in the war or something?
01:22:08.590,01:22:11.593,"-What, is your friend stupid or something? -What did you say?"
01:22:11.718,01:22:13.637,"I said, Is your friend stupid or something?"
01:22:21.603,01:22:26.275,Get your goddamned clothes -and get the hell out of here! -You should be in a sideshow.
01:22:26.400,01:22:27.818,-Go on! Get outta here! -You big loser!
01:22:31.864,01:22:34.450,-You retard! -Loser. You freak!
01:22:39.288,01:22:40.789,"Oh, no. No."
01:23:06.064,01:23:09.651,"I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's Eve party, Lieutenant Dan."
01:23:10.527,01:23:12.404,She tastes like cigarettes.
01:23:33.717,01:23:38.722,He didn't want to be called crippled just like I didn't want to be called stupid.
01:23:44.353,01:23:45.896,"Happy new year, Gump."
01:23:50.692,01:24:01.119,"The U.S. ping-pong team met with President Nixon today at an Oval Office ceremony…… Wouldn't you know it… a few months later, they invited me and the ping-pong team to visit the White House."
01:24:01.703,01:24:04.248,So I went… again.
01:24:04.831,01:24:08.377,And I met the president of the United States again.
01:24:08.919,01:24:11.922,"Only this time, they didn't get us rooms in a real fancy hotel."
01:24:12.005,01:24:15.050,"So, are you enjoying yourself in our nation's capital, young man?"
01:24:15.300,01:24:17.427,"-Yes, sir. -Well, where are you staying?"
01:24:18.428,01:24:20.514,It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
01:24:20.597,01:24:22.933,"Oh, no, no, no. I know a much nicer hotel."
01:24:23.016,01:24:26.520,It's brand-new. Very modern. I'll have my people take care of it for you.
01:24:29.815,01:24:34.319,you might want to send a maintenance man over to that office across the way.
01:24:34.695,01:24:40.576,"The lights are off and they must be looking for a fuse box, or something 'cause them flashlights, the… they're keeping me awake."
01:24:49.626,01:24:54.590,Therefore… I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
01:24:54.923,01:25:01.972,Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office.
01:25:02.931,01:25:14.067,As I recall the high hopes for America with which we began this second term… Forrest Gump.
01:25:15.152,01:25:16.903,"-Yes, sir! -As you were."
01:25:17.362,01:25:19.072,I have your discharge papers.
01:25:19.573,01:25:20.866,"Service is up, son."
01:25:23.827,01:25:26.747,Does this mean I can't play ping-pong no more?
01:25:41.553,01:25:43.138,So I went home.
01:26:04.993,01:26:06.036,"I'm home, Mama."
01:26:06.787,01:26:08.538,I know. I know.
01:26:11.667,01:26:12.876,"-I had no idea… -He's here, everybody!"
01:26:15.587,01:26:18.090,"We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest."
01:26:18.173,01:26:20.759,Everybody wants you to use their ping-pong stuff.
01:26:21.218,01:26:28.308,"One man even left a check for 25,000 dollars if you'd be agreeable to sayin' you like using their paddle."
01:26:28.642,01:26:31.353,"Oh, but, Mama. I only like using my own paddle."
01:26:31.436,01:26:33.563,"-Hi, Miss Louise. -Hey, Forrest."
01:26:33.647,01:26:39.111,"I know that, I know that but it's 25,000 dollars, Forrest."
01:26:39.236,01:26:43.156,"I thought maybe you could hold it for a while, see if it grows on you."
01:26:48.829,01:26:59.214,"I didn't stay home for long because I'd made a promise to Bubba, to meet Bubba's family and make their introduction."
01:26:59.840,01:27:03.760,Are you crazy or just plain stupid?
01:27:04.094,01:27:06.054,"Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue."
01:27:06.638,01:27:07.639,I guess.
01:27:14.563,01:27:16.690,"Hey, Bubba. It's me, Forrest Gump."
01:27:20.152,01:27:24.239,"I remember everything you said, and I got it all figured out."
01:27:27.033,01:27:33.123,"I'm taking the 24,562 dollars and 47 cent."
01:27:33.623,01:27:43.800,"that I got, that it… that's left after a new haircut and a new suit and took Mama out to a real fancy dinner, and I bought a bus ticket, then three Dr. Peppers."
01:27:47.387,01:27:51.099,"-Are you stupid or something? -Stupid is as stupid does, sir."
01:27:51.683,01:28:05.906,"Well, that's what's left after me saying, When I was in China on the all-America ping-pong team, I just loved playing ping-Pong with my Flex-O-Lite ping-pong paddle, which everybody knows isn't true, but Mama said it was just a little white lie, so it wouldn't hurt nobody."
01:28:12.496,01:28:16.416,"ropes, and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat."
01:28:41.483,01:28:43.318,but you know what I found out?
01:28:45.403,01:28:47.614,Shrimping is tough.
01:28:50.158,01:28:51.535,I only caught five.
01:28:58.542,01:29:00.460,"Hey, you ever think about namin' this old boat?"
01:29:00.585,01:29:02.754,It's bad luck to have a boat without a name.
01:29:08.176,01:29:14.641,"but there was only one I could think of, the most beautiful name in the wide world."
01:29:38.748,01:29:40.959,but I thought about her a lot.
01:29:41.376,01:29:44.337,And I hoped whatever she was doin' made her happy.
01:31:58.388,01:31:59.472,Hey!
01:32:23.329,01:32:26.875,"Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing here?"
01:32:28.209,01:32:31.171,"Well, thought I'd try out my sea legs."
01:32:32.130,01:32:34.549,"Well, you ain't got no legs, Lieutenant Dan."
01:32:35.800,01:32:37.302,"Yes, I know that."
01:32:38.470,01:32:40.305,"You wrote me a letter, you idiot."
01:32:46.936,01:32:58.198,"And… I told you if you were ever a shrimp boat captain, that I'd be your first mate. Well, here I am. I'm a man of my word."
01:32:58.573,01:32:59.449,Okay.
01:32:59.824,01:33:03.703,"Yeah, but don't you be thinking that I'm going to be calling you sir."
01:33:03.912,01:33:04.788,"No, sir."
01:33:14.255,01:33:15.507,It's my boat.
01:33:23.223,01:33:25.975,"we'll find some shrimp, so take a left."
01:33:30.688,01:33:32.816,Over there! They're over there!
01:33:33.441,01:33:35.902,Get… get on the wheel and take a left.
01:33:36.319,01:33:37.445,Okay.
01:33:39.114,01:33:43.409,"Gump, what are you doing? Take a left! Left!"
01:33:50.625,01:33:52.335,That's where we'll find them.
01:34:04.806,01:34:08.685,"-Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan. -Okay, so I was wrong."
01:34:09.811,01:34:11.938,"Well, how are we gonna find them?"
01:34:13.064,01:34:15.733,"Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp."
01:34:26.202,01:34:31.791,"Sometimes Lieutenant Dan came, too, though I think he left the praying up to me."
01:34:46.806,01:34:47.807,No shrimp.
01:34:49.350,01:34:51.186,Where the hell's this God of yours?
01:34:51.853,01:34:57.984,"It's funny Lieutenant Dan said that 'cause right then, God showed up."
01:35:16.753,01:35:29.057,"Now, me, I was scared… You call this a storm?"
01:35:30.016,01:35:33.895,"Blow, you son of a bitch! Blow!"
01:35:34.562,01:35:38.816,It's time for a showdown! You and me!
01:35:50.787,01:35:55.124,"Hurricane Carmen came through here yesterday, destroying nearly everything in its path."
01:35:55.458,01:36:04.259,"And as in other towns up and down the coast, Bayou La Batre's entire shrimping industry has fallen victim to carmen and has been left in utter ruin."
01:36:04.676,01:36:11.516,"Speaking with local officials, this reporter has learned, in fact, only one shrimping boat actually survived the storm."
01:36:11.808,01:36:13.977,"Louise. Louise, there's Forrest."
01:36:24.988,01:36:32.370,"for shrimp cocktails and barbecues and all and we were the only boat left standin', Bubba Gump shrimp's what they got."
01:36:33.663,01:36:37.333,We got a whole bunch of boats. Twelve Jennys.
01:36:38.209,01:36:41.963,A big ol' warehouse. We even have hats that say Bubba Gump on them.
01:36:42.171,01:36:43.464,Bubba Gump shrimp.
01:36:44.382,01:36:46.926,"-It's a household name. -Hold on there, boy."
01:36:47.260,01:36:51.723,Are you tellin' me you're the owner of the Bubba Gump shrimp corporation?
01:36:52.015,01:36:54.475,Yes. We got more money than Davy Crockett.
01:37:03.609,01:37:08.072,We were sittin' next to a millionaire.
01:37:09.782,01:37:19.542,"Well, I thought it was a very lovely story, and you tell it so well, with such enthusiasm."
01:37:21.127,01:37:23.504,Would you like to see what Lieutenant Dan looks like?
01:37:30.720,01:37:32.013,That's him right there.
01:37:35.767,01:37:37.101,about Lieutenant Dan.
01:37:38.394,01:37:47.653,Forrest… I never thanked you for saving my life.
01:38:17.141,01:38:20.228,but I think he made his peace with God.
01:38:30.113,01:38:33.157,President Ford escaped possible assassination today.
01:38:40.081,01:38:42.667,"Yeah, well, you'll have to tell them to call him back."
01:38:46.045,01:39:09.318,"Lynett Alice Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson better known as Squeaky, attempted to assassinate the President as he was… -Where's Mama? -She's upstairs."
01:39:12.113,01:39:13.531,"Hi, Forrest."
01:39:14.991,01:39:17.201,"-I'll see you tomorrow. -Oh, all right."
01:39:24.041,01:39:26.586,"We sure got you straightened out, didn't we, boy?"
01:39:38.681,01:39:39.932,"What's the matter, Mama?"
01:39:41.100,01:39:42.894,"I'm dying, Forrest."
01:39:46.022,01:39:48.107,"Come on in, sit down over here."
01:40:02.622,01:40:04.040,"Why are you dying, Mama?"
01:40:05.041,01:40:06.250,It's my time.
01:40:07.168,01:40:08.794,It's just my time.
01:40:10.046,01:40:15.092,"Oh, now… don't you be afraid, sweetheart."
01:40:16.344,01:40:18.513,Death is just a part of life.
01:40:19.722,01:40:22.058,Something we're all destined to do.
01:40:23.976,01:40:28.189,"I didn't know it, but I was destined to be your mama."
01:40:29.524,01:40:30.983,I did the best I could.
01:40:33.861,01:40:39.283,Well… I happen to believe you make your own destiny.
01:40:40.493,01:40:43.704,You have to do the best with what God gave you.
01:40:47.583,01:40:49.293,"What's my destiny, Mama?"
01:40:51.712,01:40:54.173,You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself.
01:40:56.217,01:40:58.511,"Life is a box of chocolates, Forrest."
01:40:59.345,01:41:01.347,You never know what you're gonna get.
01:41:04.100,01:41:05.726,so I could understand them.
01:41:06.060,01:41:08.229,"I will miss you, Forrest."
01:41:10.231,01:41:14.235,She had got the cancer and died on a Tuesday.
01:41:15.861,01:41:18.823,I bought her a new hat with little flowers on it.
01:41:22.159,01:41:24.453,And that's all I have to say about that.
01:41:32.128,01:41:34.589,Didn't you say you were waiting for the number seven bus?
01:41:34.672,01:41:37.383,There'll be another one along shortly.
01:41:41.178,01:41:55.234,"Now because I had been a football star and a war hero and national celebrity and a shrimping boat captain and a college graduate, the city fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, decided to get together and offered me a fine job."
01:41:56.777,01:41:59.655,So I… I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan.
01:42:00.489,01:42:02.658,Though he did take care of my Bubba Gump money.
01:42:02.950,01:42:07.038,He got me invested in some kind of fruit company.
01:42:07.913,01:42:15.379,"And so then I got a call from him saying, We don't have to worry about money no more. And I said, That's good. One less thing."
01:42:18.215,01:42:46.410,"Now Mama said there's only so much fortune a man really needs, And I gave a whole bunch to the Bayou La Batre Fishing Hospital I gave Bubba's mama Bubba's share."
01:42:50.873,01:42:51.832,And you know what?
01:42:53.584,01:42:56.295,She didn't have to work in nobody's kitchen no more.
01:42:57.129,01:42:58.422,That smells wonderful.
01:42:59.548,01:43:05.346,"And 'cause I was a gozillionaire and I liked doing it so much, I cut that grass for free."
01:43:09.350,01:43:17.650,"But at nighttime when there was nothing to do, and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny."
01:44:24.049,01:44:25.050,she was there.
01:44:58.125,01:44:59.126,"Hello, Forrest."
01:45:00.252,01:45:01.462,"Hello, Jenny."
01:45:17.102,01:45:28.531,"Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go, or maybe it was because she was so tired 'cause she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years."
01:45:29.907,01:45:31.909,It was wonderful havin' her home.
01:45:33.452,01:45:43.629,"Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree, and she'd listen about ping-ponging and shrimping and Mama makin' a trip up to heaven."
01:45:43.838,01:45:48.217,"I did all the talking. Jenny, most of the time, was real quiet."
01:45:48.384,01:47:12.760,…and rain and rain-- Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks.
01:47:18.349,01:47:21.226,but I didn't care. It was like olden times.
01:47:21.518,01:47:24.104,We was like peas and carrots again.
01:47:25.981,01:47:33.989,"Every day, I'd pick pretty flowers and put them in her room for her, -and she gave me the best gift… -Okay, you can open your eyes."
01:47:36.408,01:47:37.868,They make them just for running.
01:48:29.086,01:48:31.422,-in the nation's 200 year history…… -You done watching it?
01:48:35.092,01:48:46.729,"of tall ships earlier, the Statue of Liberty-- Will you marry me?"
01:48:52.401,01:48:54.611,"I'd make a good husband, Jenny."
01:48:57.740,01:48:59.199,"You would, Forrest."
01:49:01.744,01:49:03.370,But you won't marry me.
01:49:06.331,01:49:07.833,You don't want to marry me.
01:49:12.087,01:49:14.089,"Why don't you love me, Jenny?"
01:49:19.553,01:49:25.392,"I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is."
01:50:02.930,01:50:07.976,"Jenny-- Forrest, I do love you."
01:51:01.738,01:51:03.407,Where are you running off to?
01:51:04.199,01:51:05.576,I'm not running.
01:52:40.712,01:52:42.464,I decided to go for a little run.
01:52:43.215,01:52:49.429,"So I ran to the end of the road, and when I got there, I thought maybe I'd run to the end of town."
01:52:54.935,01:52:57.854,I thought maybe I'd just run across Greenbow County.
01:52:58.981,01:53:04.528,"Now, I figured since I run this far, maybe I'd just run across the great State of Alabama."
01:53:04.987,01:53:06.405,And that's what I did.
01:53:06.947,01:53:08.615,I ran clear across Alabama.
01:53:09.783,01:53:12.327,For no particular reason. I just kept on goin'.
01:53:14.079,01:53:15.372,I ran clear to the ocean.
01:53:25.465,01:53:28.051,"might as well turn around, just keep on going."
01:53:32.014,01:53:41.481,"And when I got to another ocean, I figured since I'd gone this far… I might as well just turn back and keep right on going."
01:53:43.066,01:53:45.277,"When I got tired, I slept."
01:53:45.944,01:53:47.487,"When I got hungry, I ate."
01:53:48.155,01:53:53.577,When I had to go… you know… I went.
01:53:58.832,01:53:59.916,Yeah.
01:54:37.120,01:54:40.415,about Mama and Bubba and Lieutenant Dan.
01:54:41.416,01:54:44.586,"But most of all, I thought about Jenny."
01:54:46.004,01:54:47.547,I thought about her a lot.
01:54:48.924,01:54:57.641,"For more than two years, a man named Forrest Gump, a gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, stopping only to sleep, has been running across America."
01:54:57.766,01:54:59.518,Charles Cooper brings you this report.
01:55:00.685,01:55:08.777,"For the fourth time on his journey across America, Forrest Gump, the gardener from Greenbow, Alabama, is about to cross the Mississippi River again today."
01:55:09.653,01:55:11.738,"-I'll be damned. Forrest? -Sir, why are you running?"
01:55:11.905,01:55:14.699,-Why are you running? -Are you doing this for world peace?
01:55:14.783,01:55:17.994,-Are you doing this for the homeless? -Are you running for women's rights?
01:55:18.120,01:55:20.205,-Or the environment? -Or for animals?
01:55:23.291,01:55:24.584,for no particular reason.
01:55:26.711,01:55:28.964,I just felt like running.
01:55:29.423,01:55:30.799,I just felt like runnin'.
01:55:32.050,01:55:33.051,That's you.
01:55:33.885,01:55:35.303,I can't believe it's really you.
01:55:35.971,01:55:40.934,"Now…for some reason, what I was doing seemed to make sense to people."
01:55:41.268,01:55:43.478,"I mean, it was like an alarm went off in my head, you know?"
01:55:43.645,01:55:45.397,"I said, Here's a guy that's got his act together."
01:55:45.522,01:55:47.315,Here's somebody who's got it all figured out.
01:55:47.441,01:55:49.067,Here's somebody who has the answer.
01:55:49.693,01:55:51.445,"I'll follow you anywhere, Mr. Gump."
01:55:58.660,01:56:01.329,"And then, even more people joined in."
01:56:03.582,01:56:06.877,Somebody later told me it gave people hope.
01:56:08.712,01:56:15.552,"Now… now, I don't know anything about that, but some of those people asked me if I could help them out."
01:56:15.635,01:56:18.805,"Hey, man! Hey, listen. I was wondering if you might help me, huh?"
01:56:18.972,01:56:20.765,"Listen, I'm in the bumper sticker business."
01:56:20.849,01:56:28.690,"And I've been trying to think of a good slogan, and since you have been such a big inspiration to the people around here, I thought you might be able to help me jump into-- Whoa, man!"
01:56:28.815,01:56:31.776,You just ran through a big pile of dog shit!
01:56:32.986,01:56:34.154,It happens.
01:56:34.905,01:56:36.114,"What, shit?"
01:56:37.157,01:56:38.325,Sometimes.
01:56:43.622,01:56:47.626,did come up with a bumper sticker slogan and made a lot of money off of it.
01:56:53.507,01:57:01.056,"all his money in the T-shirt business and he wanted to put my face on a T-shirt, but he couldn't draw that well, and he didn't have a camera."
01:57:01.139,01:57:04.392,"Here, use this one. Nobody likes that color anyway."
01:57:12.734,01:57:20.075,"For some years later, I found out that that man did come up with an idea for a t-shirt and he made a lot of money off of it."
01:57:25.956,01:57:27.707,I had a lot of company.
01:57:28.875,01:57:34.589,"My mama always said, You got to put the past behind you before you can move on."
01:57:35.966,01:57:38.677,And I think that's what my running was all about.
01:57:40.262,01:57:46.810,"I had run for three years… two months… 14 days, and 16 hours."
01:58:02.450,01:58:04.452,Quiet. Quiet. He's gonna say something.
01:58:16.339,01:58:18.216,I'm pretty tired.
01:58:20.802,01:58:22.721,Think I'll go home now.
01:58:47.621,01:58:49.497,my runnin' days was over.
01:58:51.041,01:58:52.834,So I went home to Alabama.
01:59:04.054,01:59:22.447,"The President was shot in the chest and the assailant… wonderin' if I could come down to Savannah and see her, She saw me on TV, running."
01:59:23.031,01:59:32.499,I'm supposed to go on the number nine bus to Richmond Street and get off and go one block left to 1947 Henry Street.
01:59:32.957,01:59:34.042,Apartment four.
01:59:38.129,01:59:42.967,Henry Street is just five or six blocks down that way.
01:59:44.469,01:59:46.513,-Down that way? -Down that way.
01:59:49.849,01:59:51.351,It was nice talking to you.
02:00:03.321,02:00:04.406,Hey!
02:00:09.035,02:00:11.621,-Come in! Come in! -I got your letter.
02:00:11.705,02:00:13.498,"Oh, I was wondering about that."
02:00:16.126,02:00:17.335,This your house?
02:00:17.627,02:00:20.547,Yeah. It's messy right now. I just got off work.
02:00:23.383,02:00:25.009,You got air-conditioning.
02:00:28.221,02:00:43.027,"Uh… I, uh, kept… I kept a scrapbook of… of your clippings and… everything. There you are."
02:00:45.530,02:00:46.948,"This, I got you runnin'."
02:00:49.701,02:00:53.747,I ran a long way… for a long time.
02:00:56.374,02:00:57.333,There.
02:01:04.382,02:01:07.093,"Listen, Forrest, I don't know how to say this. Um."
02:01:10.680,02:01:29.449,"I just… I want to apologize for anything that I ever did to you 'cause… I was messed up… for a long time, and-- -This is my old friend from Alabama. -Oh! How do you do?"
02:01:32.535,02:01:34.496,"-But thanks for picking him up. -No problem. Got to go, Jen."
02:01:34.621,02:01:36.748,-I'm double-parked. Bye! Okay. Thanks.
02:01:40.418,02:01:43.254,"This is my very good friend Mr. Gump. Can you say, Hi to him?"
02:01:43.379,02:01:44.464,"Hello, Mr. Gump."
02:01:47.967,02:01:49.552,"Yes, you can. Just keep it low."
02:01:58.645,02:01:59.771,His name's Forrest.
02:02:01.564,02:02:02.565,Like me!
02:02:04.484,02:02:06.110,I named him after his daddy.
02:02:07.654,02:02:09.531,"He got a daddy named Forrest, too?"
02:02:11.324,02:02:12.826,"You're his daddy, Forrest."
02:02:27.799,02:02:28.716,Hey.
02:02:30.009,02:02:31.386,"Forrest, look at me."
02:02:32.011,02:02:33.179,"Look at me, Forrest."
02:02:35.723,02:02:39.352,"There's nothing you need to do, okay? You didn't do anything wrong."
02:02:40.311,02:02:41.604,Okay?
02:02:46.150,02:02:47.360,Isn't he beautiful?
02:02:49.028,02:02:51.781,He's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
02:02:55.702,02:03:07.714,"But… Is… is he s… smart? Like, can he… He's one of the smartest in his class."
02:03:16.764,02:03:18.808,"Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him."
02:03:32.447,02:03:46.920,"Well, it's the first stage. Bert. It's planning to write a story, Bert… Now, we got, uh, paper. I'll take that paper, Bert."
02:03:47.003,02:03:48.588,"See, we have the paper to write on."
02:03:54.469,02:03:55.345,Forrest.
02:03:57.722,02:03:58.723,I'm sick.
02:04:02.018,02:04:04.479,"What, do you have a cough due to a cold?"
02:04:05.521,02:04:13.237,"I have some kind of virus, and the… the doctors don't… They don't know what it is, and there isn't anything they can do about it."
02:04:18.368,02:04:20.078,You could come home with me.
02:04:22.246,02:04:28.294,"Jenny, you and l… little Forrest could come stay at my house in Greenbow."
02:04:32.340,02:04:34.759,I'll take care of you if you're sick.
02:04:37.387,02:04:38.846,"Would you marry me, Forrest?"
02:04:45.228,02:04:46.312,Okay.
02:04:52.860,02:04:55.488,Forrest? It's time to start.
02:05:14.507,02:05:15.425,Hi.
02:05:16.801,02:05:17.760,Your tie.
02:05:31.065,02:05:32.400,Lieutenant Dan.
02:05:48.041,02:05:49.167,Lieutenant Dan.
02:05:50.752,02:05:51.919,"Hello, Forrest."
02:05:53.046,02:05:54.255,You got new legs.
02:05:55.006,02:05:56.132,New legs!
02:05:56.966,02:05:59.093,Yeah. I got new legs.
02:05:59.761,02:06:00.845,Custom-made.
02:06:01.429,02:06:05.600,Titanium alloy. It's what they use on the space shuttle.
02:06:09.479,02:06:10.730,Magic legs.
02:06:12.899,02:06:17.070,"This… is my fiancée, Susan."
02:06:19.947,02:06:21.449,Lieutenant Dan.
02:06:22.617,02:06:23.659,"Hi, Forrest."
02:06:25.453,02:06:28.706,Lieutenant Dan… this is my Jenny.
02:06:48.392,02:06:52.230,"Do you, Jenny, take Forrest to be your husband?"
02:06:54.482,02:06:57.485,And so I pronounce you man and wife.
02:07:28.474,02:07:29.642,Hey.
02:07:29.809,02:07:30.852,Hi.
02:07:43.698,02:07:52.456,"Hey, Forrest… were you scared in Vietnam?"
02:07:54.292,02:07:55.251,Yes.
02:07:56.002,02:07:59.130,"Well, I… I don't know."
02:08:00.506,02:08:09.849,Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out… and then it was nice.
02:08:13.978,02:08:17.899,It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou.
02:08:19.192,02:08:26.407,There was always a million sparkles on the water… like that mountain lake.
02:08:27.116,02:08:33.539,"It was so clear, Jenny, it looked like there were… two skies one on top of the other."
02:08:36.042,02:08:48.387,"And then in the desert, when the sun comes up… I couldn't tell where heaven stopped and the earth began."
02:08:49.972,02:08:51.557,It was so beautiful.
02:08:56.604,02:08:58.773,I wish I could've been there with you.
02:09:02.735,02:09:03.653,You were.
02:09:14.830,02:09:15.748,I love you.
02:09:25.883,02:09:29.345,And I had you placed here under our tree.
02:09:34.267,02:09:39.480,And I had that house of your father's bulldozed to the ground.
02:09:43.067,02:09:51.033,Mama… always s… said that dyin' was a part of life.
02:09:54.412,02:09:55.621,I sure wish it wasn't.
02:09:59.292,02:10:03.462,Little Forrest is… he doin' just fine.
02:10:04.297,02:10:08.301,"But… About to start school again soon, and."
02:10:10.344,02:10:14.473,"And I make his breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day."
02:10:16.517,02:10:22.523,I make sure he… combs his hair and brushes his teeth every day.
02:10:25.526,02:10:27.528,Teaching him how to play ping-pong.
02:10:29.405,02:10:30.489,Okay!
02:10:30.656,02:10:31.741,He's really good.
02:10:38.289,02:10:39.415,We fish a lot.
02:10:43.419,02:10:46.839,"And every night, we read a book. He's so smart, Jenny."
02:10:53.929,02:10:54.847,I am.
02:10:56.599,02:10:59.268,"He, uh, wrote you a… a letter."
02:11:01.354,02:11:06.484,"And he says I can't read it. I'm not supposed to, so I'll just leave it here for you."
02:11:30.257,02:11:36.180,I don't know if Mama was right or if it… if it's Lieutenant Dan.
02:11:36.263,02:12:00.371,I don't know… if we each have a… destiny… or if we're all just floatin' around accidental-like on a breeze… but I… I think… maybe it's both.
02:12:05.126,02:12:08.129,Maybe both is happening at the same time.
02:12:14.176,02:12:15.511,"But I miss you, Jenny."
02:12:22.560,02:12:27.022,If there's anything you need… I won't be far away.
02:13:02.183,02:13:03.476,Here's your bus.
02:13:04.560,02:13:05.436,Okay.
02:13:06.645,02:13:07.605,Hey.
02:13:08.606,02:13:10.191,I know this.
02:13:10.316,02:13:15.070,I'm gonna share that for show-and-tell because grandma used to read it to you.
02:13:16.113,02:13:17.615,My favorite book.
02:13:23.078,02:13:24.079,Hey.
02:13:26.207,02:13:27.374,Here you go.
02:13:32.838,02:13:40.679,"Hey, Forrest… don't-- I wanted to tell you I love you."
02:13:41.138,02:13:42.681,"I love you, too, Daddy."
02:13:44.475,02:13:46.477,I'll be right here when you get back.
02:13:51.690,02:13:54.860,"You understand this is the bus to school, now, don't you?"
02:13:55.027,02:13:58.906,"Of course, and you are Dorothy Harris, and I'm Forrest Gump."
