00:01:50.541,00:01:51.375,Morning.
00:01:52.291,00:01:53.125,Bye.
00:01:53.208,00:01:54.333,"No, shoot."
00:01:54.416,00:01:56.625,Can we do that thing? Can you have the sign?
00:01:56.708,00:01:59.250,Take a picture holding a first-day-of-school sign?
00:01:59.333,00:02:01.583,"No, Mom. I'm in 11th grade. I'm not doing that."
00:02:01.666,00:02:04.291,"Okay, don't do the sign, just a picture of yourself."
00:02:10.791,00:02:14.666,"Thank you. Have a great first day. Keep your head up high, Vivian."
00:02:23.000,00:02:24.166,You little shit.
00:03:47.291,00:03:49.250,"Did you hear, rankings are already starting?"
00:03:49.333,00:03:52.083,What? This is the first day.
00:03:52.166,00:03:55.250,"I mean, they haven't even had time to, like, look at us yet."
00:03:55.333,00:03:59.458,Are they basing their decisions on summer? Because nobody even saw us this summer.
00:03:59.541,00:04:03.125,Unless someone was spying on us playing Mario Kart in your mom's basement.
00:04:03.208,00:04:05.625,I might get ranked Best Power Slide on Rainbow Road.
00:04:05.708,00:04:08.000,-Should we have gone to a pool? -It doesn't matter.
00:04:08.083,00:04:11.541,Emma Cunningham's gonna get ranked Most Bangable for the second year.
00:04:11.625,00:04:14.666,It's not like she's been in a horrific car accident or anything.
00:04:17.208,00:04:20.500,"No, please, block the sidewalk to admire her nails."
00:04:20.583,00:04:22.291,-Hi. -There we go.
00:04:22.375,00:04:25.375,"That wasn't so hard, was it? No, it was not."
00:04:29.000,00:04:30.875,Did you hear she and Mitchell Wilson broke up?
00:04:30.958,00:04:32.500,I heard he broke up with her.
00:04:36.958,00:04:39.833,-It's so nice not to be on anyone's radar. -Totally.
00:04:44.208,00:04:47.375,It's gonna be Kiera Pascal for Best Ass again. For sure.
00:04:49.708,00:04:52.125,Do they know how much running and jumping she's doing?
00:04:55.750,00:04:58.375,and will probably take Best Rack from Olivia Day-Young.
00:05:01.458,00:05:03.375,"Eyes on the prize, my dear."
00:05:03.458,00:05:07.333,Just two more years and we will be safely tucked away in a lab at Berkeley.
00:05:07.416,00:05:09.458,What prompt will you do for the essay?
00:05:09.541,00:05:12.750,-Because those questions are stressful. -I'm doing the service one.
00:05:12.833,00:05:17.333,"I'm talking about how much I've grown from volunteering at the VFW, blah, blah, blah."
00:05:19.541,00:05:21.916,-Do you have Mr. Davies for English? -Uh-huh.
00:05:22.000,00:05:24.625,Beware. He calls on anyone who sits in the front row.
00:05:24.708,00:05:26.083,What would I do without you?
00:05:27.208,00:05:28.958,I guess we'll never find out.
00:05:39.333,00:05:41.333,-You can put your valued things. -Thanks.
00:05:48.250,00:05:49.500,Did you miss me?
00:05:49.583,00:05:50.916,-Seriously? -Where you going?
00:05:51.000,00:05:53.375,-Stop. -I got a seat right here for you.
00:05:53.458,00:05:56.416,"Okay, let's wrap up the conversations."
00:05:56.500,00:05:59.500,"Stop talking, please."
00:05:59.583,00:06:03.958,"Unless one of you young people fixed global warming, your summer vacations were boring."
00:06:04.041,00:06:06.416,"Whoa, Mike, you're not starting class without me?"
00:06:07.000,00:06:09.208,"-Wow, what a treat. Mr. Wilson's here. -Sorry."
00:06:09.291,00:06:13.208,I was helping this new freshman girl find her way to class and… she was lost.
00:06:13.291,00:06:17.500,"Chivalry might not be dead, but you will be if you're late to class again. Sit down."
00:06:17.583,00:06:19.125,"So, I shouldn't help people?"
00:06:20.208,00:06:22.708,"-That's the message I'm getting, Mike. -I missed you."
00:06:22.791,00:06:23.791,I missed you more.
00:06:27.875,00:06:29.208,Can I help you?
00:06:30.541,00:06:31.875,I don't know. Can you?
00:06:35.791,00:06:37.833,"-Okay, we are going to begin… -Hey."
00:06:38.625,00:06:40.041,"Can you help me, too?"
00:06:40.125,00:06:40.958,What?
00:06:42.208,00:06:44.916,"…with morning announcements. Chris, grab those lights."
00:06:48.833,00:06:54.291,"Student Body President Bradley Chambers here, along with argh lovely Vice President, Emma Cunningham."
00:06:54.875,00:06:56.250,"Good morning, Rockport."
00:06:56.333,00:06:59.541,Happy to be spreading the Pirate cheer for another year.
00:07:01.250,00:07:03.458,"Hey, Vivian. How was your summer?"
00:07:05.125,00:07:05.958,Seth?
00:07:09.458,00:07:12.750,"Speaking of, this year's musical will be Little Shop of Horrors."
00:07:21.291,00:07:22.458,Argh-ditions.
00:07:26.583,00:07:28.041,-What? -Stand up.
00:07:29.333,00:07:31.125,-Stand up. -Okay.
00:07:34.125,00:07:35.375,"Oh, yep. See?"
00:07:35.875,00:07:38.000,Grew like three inches this summer.
00:07:38.083,00:07:39.833,"-Wow. -Kinda hurts, though."
00:07:39.916,00:07:44.875,Growing pains. My knees-- Quiet. Or you're gonna miss the thrilling conclusion.
00:07:50.666,00:07:55.458,"And as athletics get underway, remember to cast your nominations for Student Athlete Ambassador."
00:07:55.541,00:08:01.666,"The winner will receive a $10,000 scholarship, and represent Rockport at the state caucus in the spring."
00:08:07.500,00:08:08.916,That was pretty great.
00:08:09.000,00:08:16.583,Who did the summer reading that I asked everyone to do?
00:08:18.958,00:08:19.958,You are new.
00:08:20.750,00:08:23.333,You are Lucy Hernandez. Welcome.
00:08:23.916,00:08:33.583,"Well, Lucy, since you did the summer reading, I'll ask you the first question we apparently have to ask about every work of art now, no matter what it's about or what time period it was created."
00:08:33.666,00:08:35.208,How are women portrayed?
00:08:36.500,00:08:41.375,"Well, I think the real question is, why are we still reading this book?"
00:08:42.291,00:08:52.208,"It's written by some rich white guy about some rich white guy, and I guess we're supposed to feel bad for him because he's obsessed with the only girl he can't have?"
00:08:52.291,00:09:01.083,"If the point is to learn about the American dream, we should be reading about immigrants, or the working class, or Black mothers, or at least someone who doesn't have a mansion."
00:09:02.333,00:09:05.291,-Why aren't we reading Sandra Cisneros-- -I thought it was great.
00:09:05.791,00:09:07.166,"Hey, I was talking."
00:09:08.375,00:09:10.875,"Yeah, I know, but The Great Gatsby is a classic."
00:09:11.458,00:09:14.750,Just because other books are good doesn't mean this is less good.
00:09:14.833,00:09:16.208,I didn't say it wasn't good.
00:09:16.291,00:09:18.708,-I just wish that-- -You're not listening to me.
00:09:19.583,00:09:22.416,People have read and have loved The Great Gatsby forever.
00:09:22.500,00:09:26.708,There must be something that makes it so we read it every year at our own school.
00:09:27.666,00:09:29.708,Spoken like a true Nick Carraway.
00:09:32.083,00:09:34.208,Do you know who Nick Carraway is?
00:09:37.291,00:09:39.875,He was played by Tobey Maguire in the movie.
00:09:40.416,00:09:42.083,"Okay, first day of school."
00:09:42.166,00:09:45.208,"I know everything is lame and boring, but tell me one thing."
00:09:45.291,00:09:47.583,"I don't know, Mom. I had math."
00:09:48.083,00:09:50.666,What did you learn today? What kind of person were you?
00:09:50.750,00:09:53.458,What made you smile? What were your biggest challenges?
00:09:53.541,00:09:55.333,This conversation?
00:09:55.416,00:09:58.166,"You know, you used to be a little person who did what I said."
00:09:58.250,00:10:00.041,-I don't remember any of that. -Hm.
00:10:00.125,00:10:01.208,Lisa.
00:10:01.291,00:10:02.791,"Hey, John. How are you?"
00:10:02.875,00:10:06.041,Good. Just getting some chives. Quick chive run.
00:10:07.208,00:10:08.875,"Those are leeks, actually."
00:10:09.541,00:10:15.041,"Oh… -Well, then I picked these for you. -Oh. Thank you."
00:10:15.833,00:10:17.375,-Nice to see you. -You too.
00:10:20.958,00:10:23.041,Ew. That man was flirting with you.
00:10:23.791,00:10:24.750,He was? Really?
00:10:26.083,00:10:27.083,Huh.
00:10:27.166,00:10:29.166,"Well, one thing happened today."
00:10:29.250,00:10:32.375,There was this new girl and she started getting into it with Mitchell.
00:10:32.875,00:10:40.750,"Sometimes I think about the fact that Mitchell Wilson is going to breed and his offspring will be tall, handsome assholes and it makes me very sad."
00:10:40.833,00:10:42.750,"You're so dramatic, Mom."
00:10:42.833,00:10:45.458,"Okay, Mitchell is fine, all right? It's all good."
00:10:45.541,00:10:48.541,"Mom, milk is bad. People aren't supposed to drink it anymore."
00:10:48.625,00:10:51.291,Whose child are you? You can't take my milk away.
00:10:51.375,00:10:54.458,-Hey girls. Let me help you out here. -That's okay. We got it.
00:10:55.041,00:10:57.041,"Okay, just make sure to put the eggs on top."
00:10:57.625,00:11:00.333,"So, I shouldn't open the carton and dump them in there?"
00:11:00.416,00:11:02.583,-Okay. -I'm gonna go wait in the car.
00:11:03.333,00:11:04.375,Just trying to help.
00:11:04.458,00:11:07.500,I know how to pack my own suitcase. I can pack my own grocery bag.
00:11:07.583,00:11:08.750,"Yeah, I remember you."
00:11:58.291,00:11:59.833,"Martha, knock it off."
00:12:25.250,00:12:28.000,We can do these face masks my aunt bought me.
00:12:28.083,00:12:30.875,"They, like, paralyze your face for an hour."
00:12:30.958,00:12:37.458,My mom googled it and… Hello.
00:12:38.166,00:12:40.083,Do you want to sleep over Friday?
00:12:40.791,00:12:42.625,"Huh? Yeah, sorry. Yeah."
00:12:43.333,00:12:46.750,Have you ever noticed that Seth Acosta is nice to everyone?
00:12:49.541,00:12:50.500,Seth the Shrimp?
00:12:50.583,00:12:53.708,He's not a shrimp anymore. He grew like a foot over the summer.
00:12:55.125,00:12:55.958,Yeah.
00:12:56.625,00:12:59.750,"He's just, like… really friendly."
00:13:02.416,00:13:04.458,You want to bang Seth the Shrimp.
00:13:07.500,00:13:09.875,You love him. You want to have 15 of his babies.
00:13:11.041,00:13:11.875,Whoa.
00:13:12.833,00:13:13.750,You're right.
00:13:15.166,00:13:17.166,Seth the Shrimp's gonna need a new nickname.
00:13:42.291,00:13:43.291,Hey.
00:13:45.375,00:13:46.541,Can I buy you a drink?
00:13:50.250,00:13:52.416,I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier.
00:13:53.125,00:13:54.333,Don't touch me.
00:13:54.958,00:13:56.250,No need to freak out.
00:13:57.041,00:13:58.291,I'm not freaking out.
00:13:58.375,00:14:00.708,I didn't say that you could touch me. Okay?
00:14:03.208,00:14:05.125,Why do you always have to be so difficult?
00:14:06.708,00:14:10.791,I'm literally just trying to buy a soda. You're the one having this meltdown.
00:14:14.833,00:14:15.916,That's mine.
00:14:16.000,00:14:16.833,"Oh, is it?"
00:14:26.541,00:14:27.958,Welcome to Rockport.
00:14:50.333,00:14:52.041,-Mitchell? -Yes.
00:14:52.125,00:14:53.083,-Wilson? -Yeah.
00:14:53.166,00:14:55.583,-Captain of the football team? -Yes.
00:14:55.666,00:14:57.166,He's bothering you.
00:14:57.250,00:15:00.250,-He's harassing me. -Oh. There's that word.
00:15:00.333,00:15:09.416,"If you use that word, that means I have to do a bunch of stuff, but if he's bothering you, and that's what it sounds like to me, then we can actually have a conversation."
00:15:10.000,00:15:25.333,"Lucy, I am aware that outside these walls the world is experiencing a tornado, and that, in response, young people, especially girls, are expressing their discontent about everything in every direction."
00:15:25.416,00:15:30.708,But we have to be clear about things before we move forward.
00:15:31.333,00:15:33.791,"-Okay. I just-- -Look, look, look."
00:15:33.875,00:15:40.375,I step in when we find drugs in school or when someone threatens on YouTube to bring in a weapon.
00:15:40.458,00:15:43.750,This feels like something that we can solve together.
00:15:44.500,00:15:51.458,"It's your first week of school, That can be emotional. Mm-hm."
00:15:52.166,00:15:56.083,It says here on your transcript that you play music.
00:15:56.625,00:16:01.125,I think you would make a great addition to the marching band.
00:16:02.500,00:16:03.833,Think about it.
00:16:03.916,00:16:12.958,All those cute little outfits and you can blow all those big emotions into the saxophone or the piccolo.
00:16:13.041,00:16:15.000,Whatever feels right to you.
00:16:15.583,00:16:18.375,"Gigi, let's sign her up for the marching band."
00:16:18.458,00:16:19.333,Great.
00:16:41.291,00:16:45.541,"Uh, we have English class together. I'm-- Vivian, right? You sit in the back."
00:16:46.041,00:16:47.291,"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:16:48.000,00:16:50.875,"Look, I just wanted to say ignore Mitchell."
00:16:52.291,00:16:54.291,Why should I have to ignore him?
00:16:55.083,00:16:56.833,Why can't he just not be a dick?
00:17:02.333,00:17:03.416,He's dangerous.
00:17:03.500,00:17:07.416,I don't think he's dangerous. I think he's just annoying.
00:17:07.500,00:17:10.500,"You know that annoying can be more than just annoying, right?"
00:17:11.208,00:17:13.416,"Like, it can be code for worse stuff."
00:17:13.958,00:17:17.125,"If you keep your head down, he'll move on and bother somebody else."
00:17:18.666,00:17:23.458,"Thanks for the advice, but I'm gonna keep my head up, high."
00:17:24.500,00:17:25.833,See you in class.
00:17:31.000,00:17:33.958,I let three people merge and not one wave.
00:17:34.041,00:17:35.708,It's a heartless town we live in.
00:17:38.625,00:17:41.750,"Then why did we buy, like, 12 cucumbers at the farmers' market?"
00:17:56.041,00:17:57.708,Ah! Thank you.
00:17:58.541,00:18:00.250,-Long day? -Yeah.
00:18:00.333,00:18:05.083,"There were so many DUIs and UTIs, I think I might have screwed some up."
00:18:05.916,00:18:09.000,"Hey, Mom, what do 16-year-olds care about?"
00:18:10.458,00:18:15.458,"When I was 16, all I cared about was smashing the patriarchy and burning it all down."
00:18:16.041,00:18:18.125,"Well, I can't put that on my application."
00:18:22.583,00:18:29.291,Protests continued in multiple states and were pushed back… You know how you're always telling me to keep my head up high.
00:18:29.375,00:18:31.708,It's from a song you used to play when I was little?
00:18:32.625,00:18:35.000,Yeah. Rebel Girl. Bikini Kill. Why?
00:18:36.666,00:18:37.833,"Uh, history project."
00:18:37.916,00:18:38.916,"Oh, God."
00:18:39.625,00:18:41.666,Makes me feel old. Sorry I asked.
00:18:46.500,00:18:57.541,"However, the number of female CEOs… Our fanzines were all about feminism and political issues."
00:18:57.625,00:19:02.125,I actually wrote a radical manifesto in the Bikini Kill fanzine called Girl Power.
00:19:21.583,00:19:24.166,in reported sexual harassment within the industry.
00:19:24.250,00:19:26.833,But naysayers argue tech is simply less interesting.
00:19:28.208,00:21:15.416,"The number of women graduating with Computer Science degrees… Because we don't want to assimilate to someone else's voice, standards of what is or isn't."
00:21:17.333,00:21:24.541,"Because I believe with my whole heart, mind, body that girls constitute a revolutionary soul force that can and will change the world for real."
00:21:33.666,00:21:36.625,"All right, pep rally is about to begin."
00:21:36.708,00:21:38.666,Grab a pom-pom. There you go.
00:21:38.750,00:21:41.458,"These are choking hazards, so wave carefully."
00:21:41.541,00:21:45.125,"Oh, sure. Put me in the back like you always do. That's so original."
00:21:45.708,00:21:47.125,Whose year is this?
00:21:47.208,00:21:48.500,Argh year.
00:21:49.083,00:21:51.166,You get one. You get one.
00:21:51.750,00:21:52.583,Nice try.
00:21:58.000,00:22:02.375,"If pep rallies were for teams who actually won games, they'd be doing soccer cheers."
00:22:02.458,00:22:04.833,Maybe the bake sale could buy us new uniforms.
00:22:04.916,00:22:09.000,They would be baking some cookies and cakes and pies for us.
00:22:14.458,00:22:15.291,Hello.
00:22:36.083,00:22:37.541,Woo! Woo!
00:22:43.958,00:22:45.416,All right.
00:22:46.625,00:22:48.041,Love that.
00:22:48.125,00:22:49.791,Those girls got moxie.
00:22:52.541,00:22:56.583,"In fact, this entire school's got moxie, am I right?"
00:22:56.666,00:22:57.791,Let me hear it!
00:23:00.625,00:23:01.791,Moxie?
00:23:01.875,00:23:03.541,"What is she, like, 100 years old?"
00:23:03.625,00:23:12.083,"All right, let's save some of that energy to welcome your team captain, Mitchell Wilson and the Rockport Pirates."
00:23:29.625,00:23:30.583,Stop.
00:23:45.916,00:23:58.750,"What's up, guys? So, I was up, like, all night last night thinking of some words that represent this year… You know that list is pretty messed up if you think about it."
00:23:58.833,00:23:59.666,"Yeah, duh."
00:24:09.916,00:24:12.833,"Thank you, Bradley. That was so amazing. Thank you!"
00:24:12.916,00:24:15.958,"Obvs, Emma got Most Bangable."
00:24:16.041,00:24:16.875,Boring.
00:24:17.666,00:24:19.833,"No, I mean, like, really messed up."
00:24:21.416,00:24:23.083,"Oh, man. I called it."
00:24:23.166,00:24:26.916,Kiera got Best Ass again. Did we bet on that?
00:24:27.000,00:24:29.458,-I can't remember. -Why have we all accepted it?
00:24:29.958,00:24:31.416,"Like, no one even blinks."
00:24:40.625,00:24:42.583,They added a new category.
00:24:45.125,00:24:47.041,"Wow, that's a lot."
00:24:51.958,00:24:54.416,I don't want to have to say the c-word out loud.
00:24:57.583,00:24:58.833,Have you seen this?
00:25:01.208,00:25:02.583,See what they called me?
00:25:04.833,00:25:06.375,"Oh. No, that's social media."
00:25:06.458,00:25:08.458,"-I don't understand. -No, it's a list."
00:25:08.541,00:25:10.916,"Well, listen, Lucy. Sticks and stones."
00:25:11.000,00:25:11.958,Are you kidding me?
00:25:12.041,00:25:14.250,Go and sit down. We're having a pep rally.
00:25:29.458,00:25:31.375,Uh… I… I don't feel well.
00:25:31.458,00:25:34.458,-What time should I pick you up tonight? -I'm not going.
00:25:42.583,00:25:43.500,Boo!
00:25:47.125,00:25:50.666,-Uh-oh. We're in trouble. -Her? She's not gonna do anything.
00:27:20.291,00:27:22.250,I need a shitload of copies.
00:27:24.083,00:27:25.291,How many is that?
00:27:27.166,00:27:30.083,Uh… Uh… Fifty.
00:27:30.750,00:27:31.750,"Yeah, okay."
00:28:20.416,00:28:21.416,What am I doing?
00:28:26.250,00:28:29.166,"I'm just, like, shook, you know? I feel attacked."
00:28:29.250,00:28:30.333,Same.
00:28:32.958,00:28:35.583,"and we, like, don't even speak Spanish yet."
00:28:44.166,00:28:45.833,"Yo, have you seen this?"
00:28:54.458,00:28:55.750,Who made this?
00:28:56.416,00:28:58.375,Are these in all of the bathrooms now?
00:29:15.375,00:29:16.708,I can't believe you did that.
00:29:16.791,00:29:19.416,-Huh? -You made me go to the game alone.
00:29:20.000,00:29:21.000,"Oh, right."
00:29:21.750,00:29:25.583,"Anyways, Bradley fell over in his Pirate costume. It was hilarious."
00:29:28.833,00:29:30.125,That is the news. Goodbye.
00:29:44.500,00:29:46.458,"Hey, ladies first."
00:29:46.958,00:29:49.583,Can I say that? Do you wanna go first?
00:29:50.166,00:29:51.291,-Yeah. Thanks. -Yeah?
00:29:51.375,00:29:52.791,Abso-fruitly.
00:29:57.000,00:29:59.458,Tell me you wrote it and I'll give it back to you.
00:30:03.750,00:30:04.708,But admit it.
00:30:04.791,00:30:07.166,"I don't care, I don't have to tell you anything."
00:30:07.750,00:30:10.041,"Whoa. God, you're such a whiner."
00:30:10.125,00:30:12.875,Why don't you go tattle on me again to Principal Shelly.
00:30:15.291,00:30:16.750,"Oh, Jay, guess what."
00:30:16.833,00:30:18.000,We're famous.
00:30:18.083,00:30:22.541,We made Lucy's little Dirtbags of Rockport High List.
00:30:23.041,00:30:27.250,"I got Most Awful, and you got Biggest Piece of Shit."
00:30:27.916,00:30:29.708,"Winners! Oh, we win, baby!"
00:30:33.833,00:30:36.375,"You know there are real problems in the world, right?"
00:30:37.416,00:30:41.333,Like ones that are bigger than two kids not thinking you're hot.
00:30:44.500,00:30:45.916,Oh!
00:30:46.000,00:30:48.625,Now that's a righteous burn with a swish.
00:30:50.625,00:30:51.958,"Anyway, listen."
00:30:52.041,00:30:53.291,"Yeah, walk away."
00:30:53.375,00:30:55.666,Hey. You can have mine.
00:31:02.208,00:31:11.041,Sorry I'm late. I had a little bit of a… You know what? I don't have to explain myself to you people.
00:31:11.125,00:31:12.833,Uh… Let's get into it.
00:31:16.333,00:31:18.708,"So, I tried that face mask, and look."
00:31:21.750,00:31:23.750,"-I'm zooming. -To be honest, it was painful."
00:31:23.833,00:31:25.833,"Hey, can I sit with you guys?"
00:31:26.333,00:31:27.416,"Yeah, sure."
00:31:30.583,00:31:34.250,I needed a sign from the universe that there were actual humans here.
00:31:36.583,00:31:39.291,Um… I don't know. I found it in the girls' bathroom.
00:31:39.375,00:31:44.666,"It's a zine. In the Bay Area, there are tons of them at shows, but it's the first time that I've seen one here."
00:31:44.750,00:31:46.791,Sorry we are not the Bay Area.
00:31:47.583,00:31:50.791,So are you guys gonna do the thing that it says for tomorrow?
00:31:50.875,00:31:53.708,It says to draw hearts and stars on your hands to show support.
00:31:53.791,00:31:55.041,"Yeah, I was gonna do it."
00:31:55.125,00:31:56.291,"Yeah, me too."
00:31:56.791,00:31:57.708,Why?
00:31:59.458,00:32:02.125,"-What do you mean why? -I mean, like, what's the goal?"
00:32:02.833,00:32:04.500,"Revolution, baby."
00:32:05.583,00:32:08.250,I don't see what doodling on our hands is gonna do.
00:32:09.083,00:32:11.291,"Well, it's better than doing nothing."
00:32:12.708,00:32:15.375,I'm just hyped somebody made this. Whoever did it is dope.
00:32:45.333,00:32:46.166,Hey.
00:32:47.250,00:32:48.250,You're home late.
00:32:49.000,00:32:50.541,I had a dinner after work.
00:32:51.333,00:32:53.708,-You look extra nice. -Hm.
00:32:54.875,00:32:56.250,That's cute. What's that?
00:32:57.250,00:32:59.041,"This? Uh, it's nothing."
00:34:10.625,00:34:11.625,Cool.
00:34:16.500,00:34:17.833,"Hell, yeah, it is."
00:34:17.916,00:34:21.041,Showing the people what's up. Females gotta stick together.
00:34:21.708,00:34:24.041,"Number one untapped resource, women."
00:34:24.125,00:34:25.041,There she goes.
00:34:25.125,00:34:28.541,There are more of us than them. Breaking the glass ceiling.
00:34:28.625,00:34:29.875,Lady power.
00:34:40.333,00:34:42.000,"Stars for a star, baby."
00:34:45.916,00:34:47.791,"Hey, Meg. Nice hand."
00:34:47.875,00:34:50.250,"Oh, thanks. You too."
00:34:52.750,00:34:55.666,"Good morning, and welcome to the revolution. Bam."
00:34:55.750,00:34:57.416,-Oh! -Please tell me you did it.
00:34:57.500,00:34:59.125,Yeah. Duh. Do you like it?
00:35:02.250,00:35:03.666,Moxie girls fight back.
00:35:04.291,00:35:07.416,"-There are more of us than you think. -Oh, that's so cool."
00:35:20.791,00:35:21.666,That's hot.
00:35:23.375,00:35:26.708,"Okay, everyone quiet down. Guys, grab a seat."
00:35:26.791,00:35:34.166,"Um… We don't have a ton of time, so I would like to waste some on morning announcements."
00:35:34.250,00:35:36.083,Chris. Lights.
00:35:40.458,00:35:46.541,"Just a quick update on my injury. It was a green break, and it, like, didn't… It didn't even hurt at all."
00:35:46.625,00:35:51.375,"So, I shall be ready to cheer again on the SS football field come Friday."
00:35:51.458,00:35:58.583,"Hey. So Bradley Chambers's parents are going out of town, I think to Mongolia or something, but he's gonna have a party, which is cool."
00:35:58.666,00:36:03.166,"It's Hawaiian-themed though, which isn't that cool, but are you gonna go?"
00:36:03.875,00:36:05.250,Yeah. Yeah.
00:36:09.666,00:36:11.666,"Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Davies."
00:36:12.166,00:36:17.250,"Uh… Kaitlynn Price, do you have a sweater or a jacket?"
00:36:18.708,00:36:19.541,Why?
00:36:21.458,00:36:28.083,"Well, your straps are a little thin and you're showing lots of collarbone."
00:36:29.583,00:36:32.458,It's like the exact same one she's wearing.
00:36:36.541,00:36:37.541,Enough.
00:36:38.416,00:36:45.083,"Kaitlynn, please give me a break and just cover up, so that we can all get back to learning."
00:36:45.166,00:36:47.333,I don't have anything to cover up with.
00:36:50.708,00:36:52.541,"Okay, come with me."
00:36:55.041,00:36:58.333,"Oh, girl, you bad. You're going to jail."
00:36:58.416,00:37:02.041,You in trouble. That's what you get for trying to dress like Britney Spears.
00:37:03.541,00:37:06.000,-You're wearing the same thing. -You're right.
00:37:06.083,00:37:08.333,"I need to go with her, so we can talk about that."
00:37:08.416,00:37:13.875,"We need to stick together. I'll-- Mitchell, you want to laugh? Laugh at the announcements."
00:37:17.333,00:37:20.333,and represent Rockport at the state caucus in the spring.
00:37:23.208,00:37:28.541,"They were wearing the same thing, but she got in trouble because she looks a little different than that other girl."
00:37:31.333,00:37:33.541,"Shelly was like, You gotta put on a sweater."
00:37:33.625,00:37:35.041,"She's like, I don't have one."
00:37:35.125,00:37:39.333,"And so then Shelly said, Come with me, and she sent her home."
00:37:39.416,00:37:40.583,Isn't that crazy?
00:37:40.666,00:37:41.500,Wow.
00:37:42.041,00:37:44.458,I am so glad we didn't have a dress code.
00:37:44.541,00:37:47.625,"Me and my friends were such assholes, we protested everything."
00:37:48.583,00:37:53.500,"One time someone told our friend Sarah that she smelled, and none of us showered for two weeks."
00:37:55.625,00:37:59.375,"But how do you know what to do? Like, how to protest something?"
00:38:00.083,00:38:02.791,"We didn't. You know, we made a ton of mistakes."
00:38:02.875,00:38:05.958,We argued with each other. We weren't intersectional enough.
00:38:06.041,00:38:08.125,We called our meetings powwows.
00:38:10.416,00:38:12.250,But you're glad you did it all?
00:38:12.333,00:38:14.583,Of course. What are you gonna do? Nothing?
00:38:16.625,00:38:17.833,You sound like Lucy.
00:38:17.916,00:38:20.416,"Oh. That's that new girl, right? You like her."
00:38:21.083,00:38:23.125,Yeah. Yeah.
00:38:23.208,00:38:24.666,"I mean, we're so different."
00:38:25.166,00:38:28.333,Sometimes you meet someone different and you just kind of click.
00:38:29.375,00:38:32.291,Like that guy John that we saw at the supermarket.
00:38:33.000,00:38:37.291,"I don't know. We don't really agree on things, but we've been cracking each other up at work."
00:38:37.375,00:38:39.791,Yeah. Lucy is fine. She's great.
00:38:39.875,00:38:41.500,It's Claudia that's being weird.
00:38:41.583,00:38:44.166,"Wait, you're having problems with Claudia?"
00:38:44.250,00:38:47.791,Don't stress me out. You're supposed to be best friends with Claudia for life.
00:38:48.291,00:38:51.583,Do you remember when you guys used to sing the song from Wicked?
00:38:53.541,00:38:56.541,"-Oh, no. -No, Mom, we're fine. Okay?"
00:38:56.625,00:38:59.708,-We're going to a party later. Relax. -Don't tell me to relax.
00:38:59.791,00:39:01.291,That's very triggering for me.
00:39:06.291,00:39:08.083,My mom had this in the fridge.
00:39:08.166,00:39:09.375,"Oh, good."
00:39:09.916,00:39:11.750,I feel like I would love white wine.
00:39:22.375,00:39:24.416,Oh… There's a lot of people here.
00:39:25.375,00:39:26.500,A lot of party people.
00:39:27.916,00:39:29.541,I'm not sure we're party people.
00:39:30.375,00:39:31.916,Did you bring a corkscrew?
00:39:32.000,00:39:32.833,No.
00:39:33.791,00:39:35.208,Maybe they have one inside.
00:39:45.333,00:39:47.791,"This is a totally safe party space, all right?"
00:39:47.875,00:39:50.416,Just do whatever. There's tons of alcohol in the kitchen.
00:39:50.500,00:39:51.375,Tons.
00:39:51.458,00:39:54.625,"My cousin's 29, so it's, like, not a big deal at all."
00:39:54.708,00:39:57.166,"Just go crazy, as long as everybody gets lei-d."
00:39:58.583,00:39:59.750,Hawaii.
00:40:00.916,00:40:03.875,"-Here, I brought this for you. -Oh, awesome."
00:40:03.958,00:40:05.750,Very adult. Wine.
00:40:07.250,00:40:09.375,This doesn't feel culturally sensitive.
00:40:10.083,00:40:11.500,I don't know. Could be fun.
00:40:13.000,00:40:13.916,Disco cat.
00:40:16.250,00:40:18.083,Maybe we should find a quiet corner.
00:40:18.958,00:40:20.708,Let the party come to us.
00:40:25.708,00:40:27.208,Maybe not here.
00:40:29.708,00:40:31.625,It could be more chill outside.
00:40:32.208,00:40:33.958,Better for conversation. Yes.
00:40:34.500,00:40:35.458,More low-key.
00:40:39.708,00:40:43.250,Maybe this is a little bit too low-key. Does that make sense?
00:40:47.333,00:40:49.208,How do you know if you're having fun?
00:40:50.041,00:40:51.416,I think I'm having fun.
00:40:51.916,00:40:54.125,I think you know it when you feel it.
00:40:54.208,00:40:57.166,"Yeah, totally. I'm having fun if you're having fun."
00:40:57.250,00:40:58.583,"Yeah, I am if you are."
00:41:01.791,00:41:03.958,Your elbows were halfway across the table.
00:41:04.041,00:41:07.083,"How about this. You two, get out of here. You two, get in."
00:41:09.583,00:41:11.833,No wonder Emma Cunningham dates a college guy.
00:41:12.333,00:41:14.416,There's no way she'd come to a party like this.
00:41:21.375,00:41:23.666,"Yeah, she's got the hearts and stars."
00:41:23.750,00:41:25.666,"Oh, I'm allergic to Sharpie."
00:41:25.750,00:41:29.208,-Come on. We want to talk to you guys. -You heard the lady. Follow me.
00:41:30.041,00:41:31.375,Where are we going?
00:41:31.458,00:41:32.333,I don't know.
00:41:38.166,00:41:39.000,Hey.
00:41:40.416,00:41:43.416,"All right, what's up, guys? I just took a lap around."
00:41:43.500,00:41:45.916,Safe to say this party is officially bumping.
00:41:46.000,00:41:48.875,"All right, just have fun, as long as everybody gets lei-d."
00:41:53.250,00:41:54.375,Good. You found 'em.
00:41:55.125,00:41:57.083,What the hell is this room?
00:41:59.208,00:42:01.958,"Yeah, I feel harassed just by being in here."
00:42:02.041,00:42:03.625,"Amaya, lock the door."
00:42:03.708,00:42:05.041,Mm.
00:42:09.541,00:42:10.541,who's Moxie?
00:42:11.041,00:42:12.375,"Yeah, who wrote it?"
00:42:12.458,00:42:15.083,"We want the who, what, where, and why."
00:42:16.000,00:42:19.291,-I found it in the bathroom. -I saw someone reading it in trig.
00:42:19.375,00:42:22.958,"So, no one knows what Moxie wants or what their plan is?"
00:42:23.041,00:42:26.125,My girl needs a plan. She does not join freaky cults.
00:42:26.208,00:42:28.000,I don't know if it's a cult.
00:42:28.083,00:42:31.875,"Yeah, I think that they want our school to be safe and fair."
00:42:31.958,00:42:35.666,You know what's not fair? Our team went to state finals and our uniforms suck.
00:42:37.625,00:42:42.458,"I got sent home for wearing a tank top. Meanwhile, Jason is constantly shirtless."
00:42:42.541,00:42:46.250,You know what's really messed up? People refuse to call me by my new name.
00:42:46.333,00:42:47.500,Even teachers?
00:42:48.750,00:42:53.875,"And I want to audition for Little Shop of Horrors as Audrey, and everyone's freaking out about it."
00:42:53.958,00:42:56.125,I would crush Suddenly Seymour.
00:42:56.208,00:42:58.125,You know what's also messed up?
00:42:58.208,00:43:00.375,I don't like being voted Best Ass.
00:43:00.458,00:43:01.833,You don't like it? Why?
00:43:02.291,00:43:07.291,"Historically, Black women have been judged by their asses and hair, and we are done with that."
00:43:09.708,00:43:12.583,The king is worth more than the queen.
00:43:13.500,00:43:16.875,"Why? The queen is the best. Okay, the queen can have children."
00:43:16.958,00:43:19.000,Look at this king. He looks like an asshole.
00:43:19.083,00:43:21.458,"Guys, I'm just glad we're talking about this."
00:43:21.541,00:43:23.166,You know that your school is weird?
00:43:23.250,00:43:29.041,"Oh, it's always been weird. We used to have a guy who pulled everyone's pants down. Now, he's a police officer."
00:43:29.625,00:43:32.458,"Okay, but who wrote Moxie for real? Come on."
00:43:32.541,00:43:35.291,Whoever wrote Moxie is a badass.
00:43:35.375,00:43:38.041,"Definitely someone, like, in their 20s for sure."
00:43:38.125,00:43:41.958,-I feel like they have tattoos. -I think whoever did it knows the school.
00:43:42.750,00:43:44.000,"Who do you think did it, Vivian?"
00:43:47.833,00:43:48.958,I don't know.
00:43:49.041,00:43:52.125,I… I just found it and picked it up like everybody else.
00:43:53.000,00:43:56.958,"But I'm really glad I did, because now we're here."
00:43:57.541,00:44:00.250,"Guys, we just had the official first Moxie meeting."
00:44:18.250,00:44:20.250,Girl-style now!
00:45:13.541,00:45:14.375,Thank you.
00:45:49.958,00:45:51.958,"-Oh, my God. Vivian. -Shit. Shit."
00:45:52.041,00:45:54.541,-I'm fine. -I'm so sorry. Do you need help?
00:45:54.625,00:45:55.583,No.
00:45:59.791,00:46:01.333,You're the one who made these?
00:46:02.833,00:46:04.333,Please don't tell anyone.
00:46:04.916,00:46:09.958,"Okay, yeah. I mean, only because secret identities are objectively rad."
00:46:11.166,00:46:14.500,Maybe you can give me some. I could put them in the boys' bathroom.
00:46:18.416,00:46:20.208,I'm not… friends with him.
00:46:20.291,00:46:23.916,I've just known him since second grade is all. I know he can be annoying.
00:46:25.375,00:46:26.791,He's more than annoying.
00:46:28.500,00:46:29.500,I understand.
00:46:30.416,00:46:33.125,"Here, I don't want to mess with your plans or anything."
00:46:33.625,00:46:35.833,Totally get it if they're just for the girls.
00:46:36.333,00:46:39.375,I just thought the boys could use all the help they could get.
00:46:43.166,00:46:45.375,"No, it's okay. You take it."
00:46:45.458,00:46:46.291,Thanks.
00:46:47.375,00:46:55.166,I don't wanna keep you from your mission… I got here early so I could retake a physics test for the second time.
00:46:58.000,00:46:59.333,"-So. -Yeah, okay."
00:46:59.416,00:47:01.416,I guess I'll see you in class.
00:47:01.500,00:47:02.416,All right.
00:47:02.500,00:47:05.958,"Hey, Vivian. Is it weird that I'm not surprised?"
00:47:07.416,00:47:12.750,"Back in kindergarten, you always wanted to take the spiders outside when everyone else wanted to smash them."
00:47:13.791,00:47:14.708,You remember that?
00:47:19.791,00:47:20.625,I do.
00:47:35.750,00:47:37.958,It's about me. Listen to this.
00:47:38.041,00:47:43.125,"Hey, Moxie girls, have you had enough of these ridiculous, sexist dress code checks? Literally me."
00:47:43.208,00:47:47.083,They're arbitrary and focus overwhelmingly on girls over boys.
00:47:47.166,00:47:49.666,-That's true. Double standard. -Quadruple standard.
00:47:49.750,00:47:54.416,Operating on the idea that girls are responsible for boys' behavior.
00:47:55.000,00:47:57.125,-My body is my body. -And it is a temple.
00:47:57.208,00:48:04.333,"In protest of this outdated archaic set of rules… On Thursday, come to school in a tank top?"
00:48:06.708,00:48:08.583,But Kaitlynn got sent home for that.
00:48:09.208,00:48:13.708,The only time I've been sent home was when I barfed during my Eleanor Roosevelt presentation.
00:48:13.791,00:48:16.041,I don't even know if I own a tank top.
00:48:16.125,00:48:20.916,"I might have bought one as a Mean Girls Halloween costume, but I chickened out and went as a ghost."
00:48:21.416,00:48:24.166,Better put on your goggles. This is gonna get nuts.
00:48:30.083,00:48:32.666,I wanna find a tank top in some dope animal print.
00:48:32.750,00:48:36.083,To remind the school we've got claws and we're not afraid to use them.
00:48:36.166,00:48:38.250,Will your parents care if we get in trouble?
00:48:38.333,00:48:40.750,Will my parents care if I show my shoulders at school?
00:48:40.833,00:48:42.833,"Nah. I mean, your mom won't care, right?"
00:48:43.583,00:48:45.708,"Well, I'm not sure. I don't think so."
00:48:45.791,00:48:48.708,She sort of did a lot of protesting when she was younger.
00:48:48.791,00:48:50.875,Really? That's fire.
00:48:52.208,00:48:54.833,"Yeah, I was thinking actually more about Claudia's mom."
00:48:54.916,00:48:56.375,She's pretty intense.
00:48:57.125,00:48:57.958,Yeah.
00:48:58.458,00:49:01.041,What's Claudia's deal? You guys are really different.
00:49:01.708,00:49:02.541,Really?
00:49:03.208,00:49:05.416,We're both INTJs on the Myers-Briggs test.
00:49:07.375,00:49:10.458,It's a personality test. We're both introverts.
00:49:11.041,00:49:23.041,"The first time I slept over, we took the test and made T-shirts that said, Yeah, Claudia's basically my family."
00:49:23.125,00:49:24.666,We do everything together.
00:49:25.166,00:49:28.291,I know one person that will be very happy to see you in a tank top.
00:49:30.250,00:49:34.000,Hands? The dude who did the hearts and stars all over his hands.
00:49:34.708,00:49:36.083,"Oh, Seth."
00:49:36.166,00:49:37.000,Yes.
00:49:39.083,00:49:40.500,What kind of woman am I?
00:49:43.583,00:49:48.125,A… professional ball buster who doesn't take no for an answer.
00:49:49.416,00:49:50.708,Okay. Now me. Now me.
00:49:52.250,00:49:58.208,"You're a mom with postpartum depression, but you're having an affair with your son's SAT tutor."
00:50:00.458,00:50:01.291,Gracias.
00:50:02.125,00:50:03.083,Beautiful.
00:50:07.875,00:50:08.958,Okay.
00:50:09.041,00:50:12.166,This is what you wear when you're doing your 6:00 a.m. run.
00:50:12.250,00:50:14.750,And you got the hydro flask. Sustainability.
00:50:22.833,00:50:24.500,"Girl, do you know how to dance bachata?"
00:50:24.583,00:50:28.250,"One, two, three, pop. One, two, three, pop."
00:50:35.291,00:50:37.541,Here. Oh. Pics or it didn't happen.
00:50:37.625,00:50:40.333,Let's get the girls fired up to burn this bitch down.
00:50:45.583,00:50:47.125,"Oh, it's cute!"
00:51:08.208,00:51:09.416,It's not a big deal.
00:51:52.916,00:51:54.500,Oh. Right.
00:51:55.583,00:51:57.541,You guys are doing that whole thing today.
00:51:57.625,00:51:59.083,You didn't do it.
00:52:04.416,00:52:07.166,"Hey, we both went with blue. Tank top twinsies."
00:52:07.750,00:52:09.875,See? I told you Hands would love it.
00:52:11.500,00:52:12.458,Who's Hands?
00:52:13.500,00:52:16.333,Uh… It'd take too long to explain. I gotta go to class.
00:52:17.583,00:52:18.583,Me too.
00:52:30.583,00:52:32.708,"-Oh, no. -Mike, if I may?"
00:52:34.000,00:52:38.583,"I just want to say that if this is what feminism is, then… I really support it."
00:52:39.125,00:52:41.083,No complaints from me or Jay. Right?
00:52:41.166,00:52:43.125,No complaints from the football team at all.
00:52:43.208,00:52:45.208,I also have no complaints.
00:52:45.291,00:52:55.291,"Not no complaints. I have no comment because this seems like a women's issue, and I'm going to respectfully just stay out of it."
00:52:57.958,00:53:04.875,"Gosh, that's so convenient for you. You get to say this is a women's issue, so you don't ever actually have to do anything. Right."
00:53:05.375,00:53:06.708,Mm-hm. That's fair.
00:53:06.791,00:53:09.250,Uh… I could do more.
00:53:09.333,00:53:21.791,I… Noticing someone filming right now and I'm going to humbly ask maybe that you just… you turn the phone off because-- Not 'cause I'm hiding anything!
00:53:25.291,00:53:28.833,You know what? This dress code thing may seem like whatever to you.
00:53:28.916,00:53:32.791,It may seem like whatever to all of you. I'd say it's another way to control women.
00:53:32.875,00:53:35.375,"If you're doing nothing, you're part of the problem."
00:53:36.041,00:53:38.500,"So, where do you stand with these tank tops, huh?"
00:53:39.208,00:53:57.958,"Where am I going to stand? I obviously am going to stand on the side of equality and freedom for all and diversity and to come together as both sides, the male and the female, the alpha and the omega, guy and gal."
00:53:58.041,00:54:02.791,"I have to go to the bathroom so bad. Hold on. I'm gonna check on one thing, but you guys got it."
00:54:30.375,00:54:32.333,"Yeah. No, that's fair."
00:54:32.833,00:54:38.208,"Someone told me they saw Shelly go out and see all the tank tops, then go back into the classroom and shut her door."
00:54:38.291,00:54:40.166,She just fully chose not to deal.
00:54:42.083,00:54:43.000,Hey.
00:54:43.083,00:54:44.208,"Hey, how'd it go?"
00:54:44.291,00:54:46.875,"Girl, it was great. We won, as always."
00:54:46.958,00:54:48.791,The crowd of 15 moms went wild.
00:54:52.083,00:54:54.083,-Hey. -Hey.
00:54:54.166,00:54:56.666,"Hello, Rockport!"
00:54:59.291,00:55:05.208,"Before we begin the game, I'm going to announce the nominees for Student Athlete Ambassador."
00:55:05.291,00:55:11.750,This is a prestigious honor bestowed annually on one athlete by the votes of their peers.
00:55:12.333,00:55:20.500,"The winner will receive a national scholarship from Big Five Sporting Goods, the only place to get all your sporting good needs."
00:55:21.583,00:55:30.916,"So just, you know, thank you again to Dave Rogers, former Rockport quarterback, for your generous contributions to our athletic program."
00:55:31.416,00:55:37.750,And Dave would like me to remind you that he rushed over 100 yards in a game back in 1972.
00:55:37.833,00:55:40.625,-You just rushed 100 yards an hour ago. -Mm-hm.
00:55:40.708,00:55:52.583,"And now, the first and only nominee for the student athlete award, running uncontested is… The suspense is killing me."
00:55:52.666,00:55:56.875,"…the captain of our Rockport High football team, Mitchell Wilson."
00:56:04.000,00:56:05.000,Okay.
00:56:07.375,00:56:09.250,Hey! I have a nomination!
00:56:10.250,00:56:11.083,Excuse me?
00:56:13.333,00:56:17.375,"I nominate Kiera Pascal, the captain of the girls' soccer team."
00:56:20.000,00:56:21.416,What? What is happening?
00:56:21.500,00:56:25.125,I'm afraid that you need five votes to support a nomination.
00:56:25.208,00:56:26.625,I second Kiera!
00:56:26.708,00:56:28.666,-I'm trying to eat. I ran for an hour. -Shh.
00:56:28.750,00:56:31.000,And I third and fourth and fifth!
00:56:31.083,00:56:35.541,That is a spirited but inaccurate demonstration… -I third! -…of democracy.
00:56:37.666,00:56:40.833,"Again, there was a ballot box in the multipurpose room."
00:56:40.916,00:56:42.041,Fourth!
00:56:47.208,00:56:48.208,Fifth!
00:56:53.208,00:56:56.041,Two fine nominees.
00:56:56.125,00:56:58.625,"Let's give Kiera a hand. Come on, stand up."
00:56:58.708,00:56:59.666,Yeah.
00:57:06.458,00:57:07.583,What did you just do?
00:57:08.125,00:57:11.000,Do you like money? 'Cause I'm finna get you some.
00:57:12.000,00:57:15.333,"-Shut up and secure the bag. -I can handle that, sis."
00:57:16.541,00:57:17.833,All right!
00:57:17.916,00:57:20.291,"Let's go, Rockport! Come on!"
00:57:20.375,00:57:22.250,"Just a quick reminder, guys."
00:57:22.333,00:57:28.166,"My wrist is still in the process of healing, so if you could please take it easy on the high-fives."
00:57:28.250,00:57:30.875,But let's play some football! Come on.
00:58:01.416,00:58:02.250,Claudia.
00:58:02.750,00:58:05.833,What is your deal? Why didn't you nominate her?
00:58:05.916,00:58:08.166,What do you care? Just go back to your friends.
00:58:08.750,00:58:11.875,Is that what this is all about? You're mad I have a new friend?
00:58:11.958,00:58:15.833,"First, you don't just have one new friend. You have a lot of new friends."
00:58:16.416,00:58:18.625,Why don't you care about this?
00:58:18.708,00:58:19.625,I do.
00:58:19.708,00:58:22.083,But making a big deal is not my thing.
00:58:22.166,00:58:25.083,"-Okay, what is your thing? -I thought my thing was you."
00:58:26.000,00:58:28.291,I thought our thing was being best friends.
00:58:30.791,00:58:32.125,Here comes your boyfriend.
00:58:32.625,00:58:34.916,Make sure to tell Lucy all about it.
00:58:37.125,00:58:39.666,Hey. Looks like we've got ourselves a race.
00:58:40.583,00:58:41.458,Twizzler?
00:58:41.541,00:58:42.416,"Yeah, thanks."
00:58:44.625,00:58:45.833,Wanna do something cool?
00:58:46.625,00:58:47.583,Yes.
00:58:51.291,00:58:52.625,Okay.
00:58:52.708,00:58:53.916,-You excited? -No.
00:58:54.000,00:58:55.250,"Yes! Yes, I am."
00:58:55.333,00:58:57.166,"God, why did I sound like that?"
00:59:00.208,00:59:01.833,What are you talking about?
00:59:09.416,00:59:10.541,A funeral home.
00:59:30.750,00:59:34.333,and I noticed how bad security is.
00:59:34.416,00:59:35.708,It's like a joke.
00:59:35.791,00:59:38.375,"If you fall and break your neck, you're in the right spot."
00:59:38.458,00:59:42.416,"-Pff. Oh, that's dark. -You're the one who's bringing me here."
01:00:00.125,01:00:01.416,"Okay, which one do you pick?"
01:00:01.500,01:00:05.875,"And remember, whichever casket you pick says a lot about you."
01:00:05.958,01:00:06.833,Pressure's on.
01:00:09.500,01:00:12.875,Um… Kind of liking this one.
01:00:12.958,01:00:13.833,Bold choice.
01:00:13.916,01:00:15.166,Glossy. You know?
01:00:15.250,01:00:16.625,I love it. I love it.
01:00:18.250,01:00:19.500,Uh… What about you?
01:00:21.166,01:00:22.708,I'm going no casket.
01:00:22.791,01:00:25.541,Mushroom suit all the way. They bury you in it.
01:00:26.125,01:00:28.541,Mushrooms get rid of all the toxins.
01:00:28.625,01:00:30.000,You compost yourself.
01:00:35.625,01:00:37.541,Three. All older.
01:00:38.708,01:00:40.416,I bet you were a pretty cute kid.
01:00:45.250,01:00:47.125,I got my hair braided a lot.
01:00:48.333,01:00:50.791,I also know all the names to the American Girl dolls.
01:00:50.875,01:00:52.458,-Do you really? -Yeah.
01:00:52.541,01:00:53.375,"No, you don't."
01:00:53.458,01:00:57.291,"-Josefina, Molly, Addy… -Oh, my God."
01:00:58.875,01:01:00.583,It's my heart. Want it?
01:01:03.166,01:01:04.000,Okay.
01:01:04.083,01:01:07.916,"-Samantha, Rebecca, Kaya… -You could fully be making these up now."
01:01:08.000,01:01:10.083,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
01:01:11.916,01:01:15.416,"Cécile, and my personal favorite, Kit."
01:01:16.458,01:01:17.791,Why is she your favorite?
01:01:18.291,01:01:20.708,She's the tomboy that wants to become a reporter.
01:01:27.833,01:01:29.500,Now that would be interesting.
01:01:29.583,01:01:32.041,Every wedding I've been to has been so boring.
01:01:32.583,01:01:36.083,"My dad's was, like, two hours of Rumi poems."
01:01:36.875,01:01:41.541,My sister had one of those kickass weddings where everyone does a dance down the aisle.
01:02:13.250,01:02:16.500,"So, why don't you tell anyone that you're the one doing it?"
01:02:17.791,01:02:18.791,Why the secret?
01:02:21.166,01:02:23.791,Uh… I kind of like that I'm the only one that knows.
01:02:24.958,01:02:27.291,I don't have to talk about it or explain it.
01:02:27.875,01:02:31.750,"I like that Moxie kind of just speaks for itself, you know?"
01:02:32.958,01:02:34.291,"Or for me, I guess."
01:02:37.125,01:02:45.208,"Someday, everyone's going to know it, but… I kind of like being the only one that knows right now."
01:02:52.333,01:02:53.583,It's getting late.
01:02:54.875,01:02:56.500,I should probably take you home.
01:03:07.625,01:03:08.958,Had a lot of fun tonight.
01:03:09.458,01:03:10.958,"-Yeah, me too. -Yeah."
01:03:34.125,01:03:36.375,"Dude, you're blowing it. You're blowing it."
01:03:37.333,01:03:38.166,Okay.
01:03:38.250,01:03:39.833,"Hey, Vivian. Vivian, wait."
01:03:41.166,01:03:44.000,"No, look, it's fine, okay? I was just confused."
01:03:44.083,01:03:46.208,You don't have to run out of your car about it.
01:03:46.291,01:03:47.125,I like you.
01:03:48.458,01:03:49.625,A lot. I do.
01:03:50.291,01:03:52.250,I don't know. I got all in my head about it.
01:03:52.333,01:03:56.083,I started worrying that maybe I shouldn't come off too strong.
01:03:56.166,01:04:00.166,"You're like this super powerful feminist, and you're not just a cute girl."
01:04:00.250,01:04:16.208,I mean you are a cute girl. Don't get me wrong-- Okay.
01:04:16.708,01:04:17.541,All right.
01:04:31.541,01:04:33.666,"-Hi. -Oh, Jesus Christ!"
01:04:34.208,01:04:36.083,Who were you kissing in the driveway?
01:04:38.000,01:04:39.291,Seth Acosta.
01:04:46.791,01:04:47.708,to the Naval Museum?
01:04:48.291,01:04:51.333,"Mom, I don't know. Don't be weird, okay?"
01:04:51.416,01:04:53.916,"If you're gonna be kissing him more, I have to meet him."
01:04:54.500,01:04:55.833,Don't keep secrets from me.
01:04:55.916,01:04:58.708,Although I know you will be safe and smart and use your head.
01:04:58.791,01:05:00.833,I'm actually already pregnant.
01:05:00.916,01:05:02.666,You've no idea what I'm capable of.
01:05:04.000,01:05:05.500,That's a very funny joke.
01:05:06.750,01:05:07.583,Right?
01:05:44.000,01:05:47.500,"Kiera, you're a much better athlete than Mitchell. You win games, he doesn't."
01:05:47.583,01:05:49.000,"Yet, you're the underdog. Why?"
01:05:49.083,01:05:50.875,-Because she's a junior. -Okay.
01:05:50.958,01:05:52.833,-Because she's Black. -Yes.
01:05:52.916,01:05:54.958,"Not what I was gonna say, but yes."
01:05:55.041,01:06:01.708,Also because we've been told in big ways and in small ways for our whole lives the achievements of men are more important than those of women.
01:06:01.791,01:06:02.958,"Well, forget that."
01:06:03.041,01:06:04.541,Forget that.
01:06:04.625,01:06:09.208,"Yes, and when you win this thing, and you will win it-- She's like Serena Williams."
01:06:14.125,01:06:15.666,It's for girls everywhere.
01:06:17.666,01:06:19.333,Hey. Do you want to join us?
01:06:20.875,01:06:23.916,"Uh… No. No, I just came to grab this."
01:06:29.833,01:06:33.041,"Anyways, so we have to get Moxie to endorse the campaign."
01:06:33.125,01:06:36.291,I have an idea. Why don't you text yourself?
01:06:39.083,01:06:42.875,"Well, if it was me, you all would know. There would be a giant parade."
01:06:45.291,01:06:47.458,"If we stick together, things are gonna change."
01:06:47.541,01:06:48.375,Yes.
01:06:48.458,01:06:53.125,"Can't stop, won't stop. Next stop, Kiera Pascal gets the scholarship."
01:06:53.208,01:06:54.208,-Yes. -Yeah.
01:06:59.666,01:07:00.541,Here!
01:07:00.625,01:07:01.708,Woo!
01:07:04.458,01:07:06.375,"On tres, si se puede! Ready?"
01:07:13.833,01:07:17.208,"Okay, CJ, you are auditioning for the role of Audrey."
01:07:46.916,01:07:48.291,Okay.
01:07:48.375,01:07:49.541,Woo!
01:07:51.208,01:07:52.291,That's 100.
01:07:57.250,01:08:00.083,Vote for Kiera. You know you don't want to vote for Mitchell.
01:08:00.166,01:08:01.541,Vote for Kiera. How you doing?
01:08:02.125,01:08:03.208,Vote for Kiera.
01:08:10.666,01:08:15.000,Who is the protagonist of the story?
01:08:17.250,01:08:18.291,You're welcome.
01:08:18.875,01:08:24.375,I caught Shelly trying to tear your guys' posters down because you never registered Moxie in the office.
01:08:25.166,01:08:26.083,"So, I did."
01:08:26.666,01:08:32.041,"Moxie is now officially a school club and gets access to elite privileges, such as hanging stuff on walls."
01:08:33.250,01:08:35.500,We might also have to learn how to play chess.
01:08:36.083,01:08:41.041,"You guys have been busting your asses, and it'd be lame for a technicality to ruin it."
01:08:48.291,01:08:49.750,"I do care, okay?"
01:08:50.500,01:08:52.208,Just have to let me do things my way.
01:08:53.625,01:08:55.791,I think Kiera might actually be able to win.
01:08:57.958,01:09:01.583,I think the only people who'll vote for Mitchell are the dirtbags of Rockport High.
01:09:03.500,01:09:04.875,We need to celebrate.
01:09:04.958,01:09:06.833,-Woo! -Yes.
01:09:08.583,01:09:10.333,I have somewhere we can go.
01:09:23.208,01:09:24.041,Listen up.
01:09:24.750,01:09:30.291,We're here to celebrate the end of the mediocre white dude's chokehold on success.
01:09:31.125,01:09:31.958,Yeah!
01:09:32.041,01:09:33.416,"Yeah, Helen! I see you!"
01:09:35.291,01:09:36.750,Girls to the front.
01:09:37.791,01:09:40.041,Kiera is gonna win this thing tomorrow.
01:09:42.958,01:09:45.458,we celebrate how far we've come.
01:09:45.958,01:09:52.125,"Let's give it up for the youngest members of the revolution, from the Rockport Middle School, The Linda Lindas!"
01:09:52.208,01:09:53.583,For girls everywhere!
01:10:07.541,01:10:08.500,Yeah!
01:11:29.583,01:11:31.833,"Good morning, Mermaids and Pirates."
01:11:31.916,01:11:33.125,What does that mean?
01:11:33.625,01:11:34.833,I'm being inclusive.
01:11:34.916,01:11:36.583,"What, so women can't be Pirates?"
01:11:43.250,01:11:44.541,"Yo, look who's not here."
01:11:45.833,01:11:48.583,"Oh, is little Mitchell Wilson too scared to lose?"
01:11:50.375,01:11:52.958,Hey. What time should I come over tonight?
01:11:53.041,01:11:56.166,"Um… Five. Also, my mom wants to meet you."
01:11:57.166,01:11:59.166,"All good. Yeah, moms like me."
01:11:59.666,01:12:03.875,Don't forget to vote for Student Athlete Ambassador before halftime.
01:12:03.958,01:12:06.166,The winner will be announced after the game.
01:12:06.250,01:12:07.541,Kiera!
01:12:12.083,01:12:13.041,Woo!
01:12:13.125,01:12:14.083,"That's right, Emma."
01:12:14.166,01:12:16.750,We're now going to hear from one of the candidates.
01:12:16.833,01:12:20.166,"Argh football team captain, Mitchell Wilson."
01:12:20.666,01:12:21.500,"Wait, what?"
01:12:21.583,01:12:22.875,-Oh! -What?
01:12:23.958,01:12:27.958,"They didn't tell us about this. If he gets to talk, Kiera should too."
01:12:28.625,01:12:29.583,"Excuse me, Emma."
01:12:33.041,01:12:36.541,"Mitchell, welcome to our humble TV studio."
01:12:37.875,01:12:40.041,Looks like you're in my… in my house now.
01:12:41.208,01:12:42.166,Student body.
01:12:43.083,01:12:50.958,My name is Mitchell Wilson and in the past few weeks I've been the victim of a targeted attack by an anonymous group called Moxie.
01:12:52.083,01:12:57.000,This group has spread propaganda and has defamed my character.
01:12:58.083,01:13:01.041,"In short, Moxie's bullied me."
01:13:02.000,01:13:04.375,"Oh, my God, he really is scared. We got to him."
01:13:06.541,01:13:10.791,But the worst part is… that we don't know who Moxie is.
01:13:12.125,01:13:16.666,A person gets to spread lies about us and not tell us who they are?
01:13:18.000,01:13:19.083,We call that weak.
01:13:20.458,01:13:25.458,"So tonight, when you go to cast your vote, just think about this."
01:13:27.583,01:13:28.708,Who is Moxie?
01:13:30.250,01:13:32.000,And who will they go after next?
01:13:33.916,01:13:35.333,Because it could be you.
01:13:41.583,01:13:43.083,"Mitchell, guys, on three!"
01:13:51.041,01:13:52.666,-Hey. -Hey. Hand this to my mom.
01:13:53.250,01:13:55.250,"-What? -Like, as a gift. Just trust me."
01:13:55.333,01:13:56.375,-Okay. -Hi there.
01:13:56.458,01:13:58.208,"Hi, Mrs. Carter."
01:13:58.291,01:13:59.583,"Oh, I'm not Mrs. Carter."
01:14:00.666,01:14:02.291,You have different last names?
01:14:02.375,01:14:04.125,"Yeah, I kept my maiden name."
01:14:04.208,01:14:07.125,Her last name is Carter. Mine's not. You can call me Lisa.
01:14:07.791,01:14:09.375,"Okay, uh… Lisa."
01:14:12.791,01:14:15.875,The ice cream I bought yesterday handed back to me. How sweet.
01:14:15.958,01:14:16.791,Mom.
01:14:16.875,01:14:20.666,"No, I love it. My daughter thinks I shouldn't drink milk anymore."
01:14:22.208,01:14:23.791,"Yeah, I don't mess with dairy."
01:14:25.208,01:14:28.416,-Milk is good for you. -Mom. We've talked about this.
01:14:28.500,01:14:29.875,-It's not good for you. -It is.
01:14:29.958,01:14:32.708,-It makes your bones strong. -It's been proven to be bad.
01:14:32.791,01:14:35.041,There's all different science about that.
01:14:35.125,01:14:36.958,-There's not. -Do you believe in science?
01:14:37.458,01:14:39.250,I do believe in science. Yeah.
01:14:39.333,01:14:41.958,"Seth, where do you see yourself in ten years?"
01:14:42.916,01:14:50.541,"-Take your time. -Ten years. Um… You know, I'll probably be skateboarding still, hopefully."
01:14:51.500,01:14:52.583,"So, no plan?"
01:14:53.208,01:14:55.708,-You don't have to answer that right now. -Okay.
01:14:55.791,01:14:57.416,You two have fun at the game.
01:14:57.500,01:14:58.583,"-Okay. -Thanks, Lisa."
01:14:58.666,01:15:02.375,"Oh, and Seth, um… try not to pee your pants this time."
01:15:02.458,01:15:05.291,"Oh, my God. Can you not bring that up right now?"
01:15:05.375,01:15:06.833,You can just ignore her.
01:15:06.916,01:15:07.875,Do you remember?
01:15:08.708,01:15:11.125,"Naval Museum, first grade, I was the room mom."
01:15:13.000,01:15:14.583,-It's coming back to me. -Okay.
01:15:16.500,01:15:18.375,-We're leaving. -Nice meeting you.
01:15:18.458,01:15:19.291,You too.
01:15:19.958,01:15:20.791,Have fun.
01:15:37.666,01:15:39.083,Your hair is so awesome.
01:15:49.583,01:15:53.083,"Um… Vivian, I feel like I should tell you."
01:15:54.083,01:15:58.416,"I haven't… I've never… Yeah, I haven't either."
01:15:59.125,01:16:03.791,"Okay, but I… I kind of wanted it to be special."
01:16:07.833,01:16:08.666,Oh.
01:16:10.708,01:16:12.041,"Okay, I'm sorry."
01:16:12.125,01:16:13.250,"No, no, no. No, wait."
01:16:13.833,01:16:14.750,I'm sorry.
01:16:19.166,01:16:21.291,I 100% want it to be with you.
01:16:25.208,01:16:28.583,I don't know if we should hurry up and do it before a football game.
01:16:30.083,01:16:32.333,I want to be the only thing you're thinking about.
01:16:38.750,01:16:40.416,You're really looking at me.
01:16:41.541,01:16:42.583,Is that bad?
01:16:43.750,01:16:44.583,No.
01:16:53.833,01:16:55.458,Your heart's beating super fast.
01:16:57.041,01:16:58.250,You nervous or excited?
01:17:01.000,01:17:01.833,Both.
01:17:05.291,01:17:07.666,"Oh, my God, Kiera's gonna win this thing."
01:17:09.416,01:17:14.625,And if she doesn't… …you can come right back here.
01:17:18.416,01:17:19.250,Deal.
01:17:20.166,01:17:21.041,I like it here.
01:17:41.958,01:17:44.791,Wow. What a close game. Hm?
01:17:44.875,01:17:48.500,"Uh, let's, uh, give it up for our Rockport cheer squad."
01:17:58.958,01:18:01.041,Okay. Right.
01:18:01.125,01:18:02.500,-Where have you been? -What?
01:18:02.583,01:18:04.500,-Uh… -Boyfriend?
01:18:04.583,01:18:05.583,Yeah.
01:18:07.166,01:18:09.041,"Also, also, look what I brought."
01:18:09.125,01:18:10.166,-Champagne. -Oh!
01:18:10.250,01:18:12.500,"Oh, we poppin' bottles."
01:18:12.583,01:18:19.583,"And now, will the nominees for Student Athlete Ambassador please step up."
01:18:20.625,01:18:22.666,"Woo! Go, Kiera!"
01:18:25.458,01:18:34.958,And congratulations… …to… Mitchell Wilson.
01:18:44.708,01:18:50.958,Rockport's commitment to character and leadership at the upcoming state caucus.
01:18:51.541,01:18:59.166,"Oh, and he'll also be able to use this $10,000 scholarship to go to any academic institution of his choosing."
01:18:59.791,01:19:04.125,"Uh, Kiera, it has been a fun campaign."
01:19:05.000,01:19:11.000,"As an educator, I just think it's wonderful and exciting to see everyone getting involved."
01:19:11.083,01:19:14.125,"Healthy, fair competition is good."
01:19:18.083,01:19:22.333,"the prices at Big Five Sporting Goods, very fair."
01:20:29.375,01:20:30.583,She lost.
01:20:30.666,01:20:32.166,"Hey, you're home early."
01:20:35.791,01:20:37.583,"-Uh… This is John. -Hi, I'm John."
01:20:38.333,01:20:44.125,"Wait a minute. You're… You're the grocery store guy. You're the chives guy, aren't you?"
01:20:45.041,01:20:46.000,You sneaky Pete.
01:20:46.083,01:20:49.125,You're the one keeping secrets from me. You're so busted.
01:20:49.625,01:20:51.333,"Go to your room, young lady."
01:20:52.083,01:20:53.375,Are you drunk?
01:20:56.958,01:21:02.333,"I mean, you try and you try and you try, and nothing actually happens, and nothing works."
01:21:02.416,01:21:11.458,"So, you know what, Mom? You don't know anything about my life, and I clearly do not know anything about your life, so I think I should do my thing and you do your thing."
01:21:11.958,01:21:13.625,"Welcome to the family, John."
01:21:21.416,01:21:22.750,You're an asshole.
01:21:23.250,01:21:25.958,"-Am I gonna get one of these? -I don't know, are you?"
01:21:28.000,01:21:29.458,Is this the best idea?
01:21:29.541,01:21:31.875,"Maybe not, but it's the idea I had."
01:21:31.958,01:21:34.041,"-Bye, Frank. -Yeah, hey, go get 'em!"
01:21:46.708,01:21:47.916,You're an asshole.
01:21:49.875,01:21:52.958,"Man, the women at this school is trippin'."
01:22:05.041,01:22:05.916,What are you doing?
01:22:06.500,01:22:09.291,Haven't you heard? I'm the winning asshole.
01:22:10.708,01:22:12.083,Are you serious?
01:22:12.666,01:22:15.958,"You know what? You are an asshole and you don't get to touch these, okay?"
01:22:17.041,01:22:19.416,If you keep doing that you're gonna hurt my feelings.
01:22:19.500,01:22:21.708,"Mitchell, take the stickers off and get to class."
01:22:21.791,01:22:22.791,"Vivian, come with me."
01:22:25.125,01:22:26.583,You're in trouble.
01:22:33.125,01:22:37.166,People have defaced school property and someone will get suspended for it.
01:22:37.791,01:22:41.166,"Apparently, Mitchell Wilson isn't the only one that Moxie doesn't like."
01:22:41.958,01:22:52.291,Principal Shelly has made it clear she has no interest in supporting the female population of this school and unfairly gave Mitchell Wilson the morning announcement for his hate speech. Hate speech? Wow.
01:22:52.375,01:22:55.708,Why did you let Mitchell give a speech on the morning announcements?
01:22:55.791,01:22:57.750,He got it because he asked for it.
01:22:57.833,01:23:00.583,"If anyone from Moxie asked for it, they'd have gotten it, too."
01:23:00.666,01:23:03.541,How were we supposed to know we were supposed to ask for it?
01:23:03.625,01:23:06.083,"If you want a seat at the table, pull up a chair."
01:23:06.583,01:23:13.791,"Listen, Vivian, I think all of this is wonderful, but it has to stay within the confines of the rules of the school."
01:23:15.583,01:23:16.666,Do you like him?
01:23:17.916,01:23:18.791,Mitchell?
01:23:18.875,01:23:21.458,The girls of the school would love to know what you think.
01:23:21.541,01:23:26.125,"Well, I'm a girl at the school, and I would love to know who started Moxie."
01:23:26.208,01:23:27.500,Do you have any idea?
01:23:28.791,01:23:29.625,No.
01:23:32.541,01:23:34.125,Someone put stickers on your car.
01:23:35.500,01:23:36.750,The asshole stickers?
01:23:38.250,01:23:40.125,Is this something for the fire department?
01:23:40.208,01:23:41.333,"God, Gigi, no."
01:24:13.291,01:24:16.458,"Hey, are we still mad at each other?"
01:24:17.041,01:24:19.208,You don't need to apologize. It's okay.
01:24:19.875,01:24:21.875,I thought you were going to apologize to me.
01:24:22.458,01:24:24.541,What? Why would I apologize to you?
01:24:25.041,01:24:30.708,"Okay. Okay, so if you're going to be an asshole teenager now, this is how we're gonna do it."
01:24:31.375,01:24:35.708,"Because you came home drunk, you have to have dinner with me and John tomorrow night."
01:24:37.166,01:24:39.083,-Is this punishment? -Yes.
01:24:39.166,01:24:46.083,It's one of those horrible punishments where you have to have dinner with your mother and the first guy she's been excited about in a long time.
01:24:47.458,01:24:48.958,Only if Seth comes.
01:24:50.666,01:24:52.875,And I can't guarantee I won't throw up again.
01:24:53.541,01:24:54.916,I'll let everyone know.
01:25:00.583,01:25:04.208,"Honestly, we're making waves, okay?"
01:25:06.458,01:25:07.500,What's going on?
01:25:09.791,01:25:11.916,Claudia got suspended for Moxie.
01:25:12.500,01:25:15.083,What…? What do you mean?
01:25:15.166,01:25:17.833,"Yeah, it's pretty awesome. She took one for the team."
01:25:22.250,01:25:25.416,"She'll write about it on a college application, and people will freak."
01:25:26.166,01:25:28.625,-She'll be fine. -Don't tell me about Claudia.
01:25:28.708,01:25:32.208,"She's been my best friend my whole life, and you only just got here."
01:25:34.416,01:25:35.541,Okay. Wow.
01:25:43.750,01:25:44.750,No.
01:26:04.041,01:26:05.916,"Front door didn't go so great, huh?"
01:26:06.416,01:26:08.000,I'd call it a bust.
01:26:08.583,01:26:14.958,Yeah. My mom would literally prefer I die of contracting bacterial meningitis than get suspended from school.
01:26:15.041,01:26:17.208,Disease is at least an honorable death.
01:26:18.416,01:26:20.666,This is gonna screw everything up for you.
01:26:21.458,01:26:22.333,I don't know.
01:26:23.333,01:26:26.166,Shelly's blaming me because I put my name down for Moxie.
01:26:26.250,01:26:28.000,I can't believe you did that.
01:26:30.958,01:26:34.166,"She kept asking me who the leader was, and I said I didn't know."
01:26:38.458,01:26:40.083,Is there anything you wanna say?
01:26:44.500,01:26:45.500,How did you know?
01:26:47.333,01:26:49.833,We've been best friends since we were four.
01:26:49.916,01:26:52.458,You think you could lead a revolt and I wouldn't notice?
01:26:55.666,01:26:57.041,Why didn't you tell me?
01:26:58.208,01:27:00.416,"At first, you were being so shitty about it."
01:27:00.500,01:27:04.208,"Yeah, because I knew it was a bad idea, and look. It was."
01:27:04.291,01:27:07.000,"-I didn't ask you to get involved. -Yes, you did."
01:27:07.708,01:27:10.125,You made me feel bad because I wasn't doing enough.
01:27:10.958,01:27:12.583,"And you don't get it, Viv."
01:27:12.666,01:27:15.375,You don't get what's going on with me because you're white.
01:27:16.166,01:27:17.458,Wh-What?
01:27:17.541,01:27:20.125,Do you know what my mom sacrificed to get to this country?
01:27:20.708,01:27:23.791,What she had to do to make it so that I could go to college?
01:27:25.125,01:27:27.875,I am under an insane amount of pressure.
01:27:28.458,01:27:31.125,I don't have the freedom to take the risks that you do.
01:27:31.208,01:27:32.708,"-Claudia, I'm sorry. -I gotta go."
01:27:34.500,01:27:37.500,My mom is making me deep clean the rugs to atone for my sins.
01:27:38.916,01:27:41.500,"If you knew it was me, why didn't you tell her?"
01:27:43.291,01:27:46.083,"Because I'm not a coward, unlike you."
01:27:57.083,01:27:57.916,"Oh, right."
01:27:58.958,01:28:00.375,This whole thing.
01:28:15.958,01:28:17.791,I got fresh ones just for you.
01:28:22.416,01:28:23.291,It's my voice.
01:28:24.291,01:28:25.416,"No, it's not."
01:28:30.833,01:28:33.166,"So, what's new in teen life these days?"
01:28:35.000,01:28:39.166,"Not much, man. Um… Physics is really crushing me."
01:28:42.000,01:28:45.208,You guys have so much in common. Maybe you should share a high-five.
01:28:47.375,01:28:52.333,"Um, do they still teach you those, um, mnemonic devices to help you remember all the laws?"
01:28:54.166,01:28:58.958,"It was like for thermodynamics, Something something never really tire."
01:28:59.625,01:29:07.333,PV equals NRT. Pure virgins-- Why is nobody asking me about physics?
01:29:07.416,01:29:10.166,Do you think because I'm a girl I don't know about science?
01:29:10.250,01:29:12.791,Not at all. You want to talk about physics?
01:29:12.875,01:29:14.041,You made a salad?
01:29:14.708,01:29:15.958,With green things in it?
01:29:16.541,01:29:20.208,"Yes, that's the colors that are traditionally found in a salad."
01:29:20.291,01:29:23.791,This isn't normal. She usually lives off frozen pizza and ice cream.
01:29:24.375,01:29:28.125,"Well, with our hours, it's hard to find time to make dinner."
01:29:28.208,01:29:29.875,That's okay. I love to cook.
01:29:31.875,01:29:34.125,Why do you have an American flag on your car?
01:29:35.500,01:29:37.875,Do you love America? Do you think it's perfect?
01:29:37.958,01:29:41.583,Do you know it's gonna take 300 years to reach gender equality in the US?
01:29:42.250,01:29:43.625,I don't love that part.
01:29:43.708,01:29:46.291,"If you don't love that part, what are you doing about it?"
01:29:46.375,01:29:47.458,"Hey, Viv."
01:29:49.083,01:29:51.083,You want me to calm down?
01:29:51.166,01:29:54.541,You want me to be nice? Like you? And make sure everybody's comfortable?
01:29:54.625,01:29:57.208,Be your cute little girlfriend with a little ponytail.
01:29:57.291,01:29:59.875,"Well, forget hearts and stars on my hand."
01:29:59.958,01:30:05.375,Why don't I just write your name on my arm and tell everybody that I'm your property or something?
01:30:05.458,01:30:07.291,-Vivian. -Fuck the patriarchy!
01:30:15.291,01:30:16.708,What's going on?
01:30:16.791,01:30:18.083,I'm not like you.
01:30:18.625,01:30:21.208,I don't want you to be like me. I want you to be like you.
01:30:21.291,01:30:24.458,I hate that. That's the suckiest thing you can say to someone.
01:30:24.541,01:30:28.125,"Just be you. Just be yourself. I mean, that is such bullshit mom talk."
01:30:28.208,01:30:30.708,Okay. Okay. What do you want me to say?
01:30:30.791,01:30:32.083,Can you just leave?
01:30:32.166,01:30:34.583,"No, this is my house. I get to stand wherever I want."
01:30:35.166,01:30:36.500,"Oh, right. Yeah, I forgot."
01:30:36.583,01:30:42.416,"You're a rebel girl, and no one tells you what to do unless it's some lame dork who flirts with you once in a grocery store."
01:30:42.500,01:30:44.375,"Hey, you can't talk to me like that."
01:30:44.458,01:30:49.541,"I'm your mother and I'm also a person, and I get lonely, and it's nice when someone likes me."
01:30:49.625,01:30:55.125,"Okay, fine, then just go enjoy your spring salad while I sit here with my entire life falling apart."
01:30:55.208,01:30:56.416,What is falling apart?
01:30:57.541,01:30:58.375,Nothing.
01:30:59.000,01:31:03.583,"Just Claudia won't talk to me, I might get kicked out of school, and I might have sex."
01:31:04.208,01:31:06.083,"Wait, you might get kicked out?"
01:31:06.166,01:31:08.250,You don't care that I might have sex?
01:31:08.333,01:31:09.416,"Vivian, slow down."
01:31:09.500,01:31:13.291,Shelly said anybody associated with Moxie is gonna get kicked out.
01:31:13.375,01:31:14.750,Claudia already was.
01:31:14.833,01:31:16.208,What is Moxie?
01:31:17.375,01:31:18.958,It's a feminist club I started.
01:31:20.500,01:31:23.625,"-You started a feminist club? -Yeah, and it's all your fault."
01:31:24.208,01:31:30.500,"I only started Moxie because you made me believe I was strong or something, but I'm not that kind of person."
01:31:30.583,01:31:34.583,"None of it is working, and no one is helping me, and I am all alone in this."
01:31:39.958,01:31:42.791,"Why isn't Dad spending Christmas with me, Mom?"
01:31:45.916,01:31:47.375,"Oh, honey."
01:32:06.708,01:32:10.791,For sure. He's the victim of revenge for a crime he didn't commit.
01:32:18.125,01:32:22.000,"at the core, he's a romantic. And this is what they do to him?"
01:32:22.083,01:32:25.500,I just can't take that Fitzgerald leaves it so ambiguous at the end.
01:32:25.583,01:32:27.708,Is he good? Is he bad? I don't know.
01:32:27.791,01:32:29.583,He wants you to ask that question.
01:32:29.666,01:32:32.416,He wants you to look upon yourself and your morality.
01:32:32.500,01:33:09.791,Do you empathize with Gatsby… Hey.
01:33:11.125,01:33:12.500,"Hey, are you mad at me?"
01:33:14.958,01:33:18.541,You mean for yelling at me at the table and ditching me during dinner?
01:33:19.500,01:33:21.625,"Nah, Vivian, why would I be mad at you?"
01:33:22.625,01:33:25.083,I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of pressure lately.
01:33:25.166,01:33:36.041,"Have you? Really? Seems like you've been doing reckless shit and letting others take the blame while you take cheap shots at me, your mom, and your mom's perfectly nice boyfriend."
01:33:37.333,01:33:39.083,I've done nothing but support you.
01:33:39.833,01:33:41.916,I don't deserve to be your punching bag.
01:33:43.375,01:33:45.208,Maybe you're not who I thought you were.
01:34:17.083,01:34:18.791,but I don't know who to turn to.
01:34:20.041,01:34:21.666,"Last year, I was raped."
01:34:22.958,01:34:26.333,"I wanted to come forward, but didn't want anyone to know it was me."
01:34:28.208,01:34:30.875,"You get things done, and no one knows who you are."
01:34:32.041,01:34:35.291,Can you help me? From one anonymous to another?
01:35:53.583,01:35:54.750,Unbelievable.
01:36:03.583,01:36:05.500,I'm gonna read you the school policy.
01:36:05.583,01:36:15.083,"Any student who walks out will be seen as demonstrating support for the Moxie group, who has vandalized school property, an offense that is punishable by expulsion."
01:36:16.416,01:36:18.083,"This is serious stuff, guys."
01:36:18.708,01:36:19.541,Okay?
01:36:20.041,01:36:21.458,Really think about it.
01:36:21.541,01:36:25.041,"Because if you do this, it's your funeral."
01:36:27.375,01:36:30.000,And I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.
01:36:48.041,01:36:49.958,"Come on, get out here!"
01:37:30.833,01:37:33.833,Speaking in front of people is my worst nightmare.
01:37:38.708,01:37:39.916,I'm not brave.
01:37:41.416,01:37:45.208,"Uh, I'm not fierce like some of my friends."
01:37:47.708,01:37:53.458,"And I do not fit the prototype of a leader in any way, but here I am anyways."
01:37:55.125,01:37:57.625,I hate that we are shoved aside.
01:37:58.750,01:38:04.083,"That we are dismissed, ranked, assaulted."
01:38:05.458,01:38:09.416,"And I mean, nobody does anything about it. Nobody listens to us."
01:38:10.041,01:38:12.375,And that is why I walk out today.
01:38:15.000,01:38:20.583,That's why I'm standing up here yelling at all of you.
01:38:25.708,01:38:27.500,It's why I started Moxie.
01:38:33.083,01:38:36.708,"You know what? If you're going to expel somebody, expel me. Okay?"
01:38:37.583,01:38:41.208,It's me. I started Moxie. I am Moxie.
01:38:42.208,01:38:43.583,"Then expel me, too."
01:38:44.166,01:38:47.875,"I started the Moxie Instagram, and I did that shit proudly."
01:38:48.666,01:38:49.750,I got you.
01:38:53.875,01:38:59.333,"I wear what I want no matter what my body looks like, and I'm never changing."
01:38:59.416,01:39:01.041,-Yeah. -So expel me!
01:39:02.083,01:39:04.958,I tripped Bradley in his dumb ass Pirate costume.
01:39:05.458,01:39:08.958,That's feminism right there. And I do not feel bad about it.
01:39:09.916,01:39:11.000,Moxie forever!
01:39:19.916,01:39:21.125,I wrote the note.
01:39:42.375,01:39:44.291,I'm the one who reached out for help.
01:39:46.458,01:39:50.583,Because it felt like Moxie was the only one who was listening.
01:39:52.500,01:39:54.500,We're listening. We're here.
01:39:55.250,01:39:56.208,And we believe you.
01:39:59.916,01:40:06.125,Last year after prom… Mitchell Wilson raped me.
01:40:12.791,01:40:19.208,He was my boyfriend… and he raped me in my own bedroom.
01:40:26.916,01:40:28.583,What does that even mean?
01:40:31.333,01:40:33.875,"Sorry, I don't know what to say."
01:40:33.958,01:40:37.083,I don't know what… I feel.
01:40:37.583,01:40:39.291,I guess I'm just angry.
01:40:41.250,01:40:45.375,"I'm angry, and I want to scream."
01:40:45.458,01:40:47.458,-Do it. -Scream!
01:40:47.541,01:40:48.791,Scream!
01:41:03.833,01:41:05.041,What does that mean?
01:41:08.625,01:41:09.958,Mitchell Wilson.
01:41:11.000,01:41:11.833,Yes?
01:41:14.375,01:41:15.250,Come with me.
01:41:17.416,01:41:19.166,I knew it. I knew it was you.
01:41:21.083,01:41:23.916,It is always the quiet ones you have to look out for.
01:41:24.000,01:41:26.541,-My mind is blown. I'm so proud of you. -Thanks.
01:41:29.166,01:41:31.500,-What are you doing here? -Your mom drove me.
01:41:31.583,01:41:33.166,Are you even allowed here?
01:41:33.250,01:41:35.458,What are they gonna do? Double suspend me?
01:41:36.583,01:41:39.666,-What would I do without you? -I guess we'll never find out.
01:41:55.125,01:41:56.083,Are you okay?
01:41:57.666,01:41:58.583,I think so.
01:41:59.958,01:42:01.375,Thanks for inspiring me.
01:42:03.333,01:42:04.166,Same.
01:42:13.708,01:42:16.666,-Right. -Does anybody want to speak? Come on.
01:42:19.000,01:42:20.208,"Come on, girlfriend."
01:42:21.083,01:42:22.166,Speak your truth.
01:42:22.875,01:42:24.125,I want to-- Sorry.
01:42:24.208,01:42:28.875,I just want to say that I'm one hundred and ten Black.
01:42:29.916,01:42:31.625,My hair is not a wig.
01:42:31.708,01:42:32.958,It's not nappy.
01:42:33.458,01:42:36.666,"It's thick, curly, and it's who I am!"
01:42:40.250,01:42:42.333,"And no, you cannot touch it!"
01:42:48.125,01:42:50.791,"Yeah, and y'all need to stop touching our hair, okay?"
01:42:53.666,01:42:54.541,All right.
01:42:55.125,01:42:59.250,"Now that everyone is aware of how much of a problem this is, we have a lot of…."
