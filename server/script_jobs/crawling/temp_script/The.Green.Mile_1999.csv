00:02:04.499,00:02:05.917,Cora!
00:02:08.044,00:02:09.212,"You make any noise, you know what happens."
00:02:57.051,00:02:58.720,"Good morning, Estelle."
00:03:20.658,00:03:21.951,Some Danish this morning?
00:03:22.035,00:03:25.204,"No, just two pieces of dry toast, Hector. Thanks."
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.873,Leftover's fine.
00:03:26.956,00:03:28.666,"Dry and cold, same as always."
00:03:29.417,00:03:30.418,Cold is better.
00:03:31.002,00:03:32.086,Hmm.
00:03:32.170,00:03:33.880,Especially on those long walks.
00:03:35.506,00:03:36.591,Am I right?
00:03:38.301,00:03:41.221,Don't let Nurse Godzilla catch you. She'll raise holy hell.
00:03:41.804,00:03:43.848,You know we're not supposed to let you wander off.
00:03:46.935,00:03:50.939,"Where do you go, every day? What do you do up in those hills?"
00:03:51.689,00:03:53.024,Just walk.
00:03:53.775,00:03:55.318,I like to walk.
00:03:57.904,00:03:59.864,"You try not to fall down, bust a hip."
00:04:00.490,00:04:03.284,I don't wanna be in no damn search party.
00:05:15.481,00:05:17.275,Explain the moral basis of that.
00:05:18.443,00:05:20.028,Tony doesn't admit that he's not a good father.
00:05:20.111,00:05:22.363,"No, it's not... She can't ask nothin', okay?"
00:05:22.447,00:05:23.406,You can't ask nothin'.
00:05:26.659,00:05:28.536,Why do we always watch this stuff?
00:05:29.412,00:05:30.788,It's interesting.
00:05:31.956,00:05:33.249,Interesting?
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.585,Bunch of inbred trailer trash?
00:05:36.461,00:05:38.463,All they ever talk about is fucking.
00:05:41.090,00:05:42.633,I'm gonna have a father like that!
00:05:46.304,00:05:47.597,I'm talking now!
00:05:47.680,00:05:48.848,What kind of a mother are you?
00:05:53.269,00:05:55.313,You're dead! You can't come back!
00:06:01.110,00:06:02.945,Are you all right?
00:06:03.029,00:06:04.072,Hmm?
00:06:04.155,00:06:06.699,You look tired. You're not yourself.
00:06:09.827,00:06:13.664,"You're wearing yourself out with those walks every day, that's what I think."
00:06:13.748,00:06:15.625,Not that you asked me.
00:06:15.958,00:06:18.336,"I just didn't sleep well, is all."
00:06:19.837,00:06:22.632,I had a few bad dreams. It happens. It...
00:06:23.424,00:06:24.884,I'll be fine.
00:06:25.426,00:06:26.511,What do you think of that?
00:06:34.644,00:06:36.312,"Oh, if Madge doesn't care, I certainly don't."
00:06:36.395,00:06:38.272,Neither do I. All I know is...
00:06:38.356,00:06:40.316,"Now, this here is worth a look."
00:07:25.903,00:07:27.196,"Paul, what is it?"
00:07:29.574,00:07:30.783,My God.
00:07:36.581,00:07:38.583,I've got to get out of here.
00:08:00.688,00:08:07.111,I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you whether you want it to or not. It's silly.
00:08:07.820,00:08:11.115,"Was it the film? It was, wasn't it?"
00:08:12.533,00:08:16.078,"I haven't spoken of these things for a long time, Ellie."
00:08:16.996,00:08:18.372,Over 60 years.
00:08:18.706,00:08:20.875,"Paul, I'm your friend."
00:08:26.047,00:08:30.092,I ever tell you that I was a prison guard during the Depression?
00:08:30.176,00:08:31.677,"Uh, you've mentioned it."
00:08:32.637,00:08:37.558,"Did I mention that I was in charge of death row, that I supervised all the executions?"
00:08:42.188,00:08:45.900,"Usually, death row is called The Last Mile."
00:08:47.068,00:08:49.403,We called ours The Green Mile.
00:08:50.154,00:08:52.823,The floor was the color of faded limes.
00:08:54.158,00:08:56.160,We had the electric chair.
00:08:57.161,00:08:58.955,"Old Sparky, we called it."
00:09:01.374,00:09:03.084,"Oh, I've lived a lot of years, Ellie."
00:09:06.379,00:09:08.172,that takes the prize.
00:09:10.174,00:09:15.221,"That year, I had the worst urinary infection of my life and..."
00:09:17.306,00:09:18.641,It was...
00:09:19.684,00:09:27.775,It was also the year of John Coffey and the two dead girls.
00:09:29.902,00:10:34.592,"Old Alabama J'ines the state of Floridy At Mobile, lordy, at Mobile Old Alabama is a hog killing country Old Alabama is a hog killing country Every fall, lordy, every fall You men down in the yard, step off the fence! Clear that gate!"
00:10:43.309,00:10:44.727,Put me through to E Block.
00:10:58.866,00:11:00.076,E Block.
00:11:00.660,00:11:01.744,Yeah.
00:11:02.453,00:11:03.621,Right.
00:11:16.634,00:11:17.676,Oh.
00:11:27.269,00:11:28.771,"Christ, give me a minute."
00:11:34.568,00:11:35.653,You all right in there?
00:11:38.447,00:11:41.909,"For a man pissing razor blades, yeah."
00:11:56.841,00:11:59.009,"You should've took the day off, gone to see the doctor."
00:11:59.677,00:12:02.221,With a new arrival? You know better.
00:12:04.807,00:12:08.102,It's not as bad as it was. I think it's clearing up.
00:12:11.313,00:12:13.107,"-All right. Let's look alive, Dean. -Yes, sir."
00:12:20.573,00:12:21.657,Damn.
00:12:23.117,00:12:25.202,They're riding on the axle.
00:12:34.670,00:12:36.213,What'd they do?
00:12:36.839,00:12:38.090,They bust the springs?
00:12:43.429,00:12:44.638,Holy...
00:12:46.849,00:12:48.142,Dead man!
00:12:49.185,00:12:50.853,Dead man walking!
00:12:55.524,00:12:57.943,"Jesus, please us, what is he yelling about?"
00:13:00.821,00:13:06.160,"Paul, you might wanna reconsider getting in the cell with this guy."
00:13:06.243,00:13:07.828,He's enormous.
00:13:07.912,00:13:09.914,Can't be bigger than you.
00:13:20.299,00:13:21.884,Dead man!
00:13:22.301,00:13:23.928,Dead man walking!
00:13:24.178,00:13:25.429,Dead man!
00:13:26.096,00:13:27.348,Dead man walking!
00:13:28.390,00:13:30.267,Dead man walking here!
00:13:31.894,00:13:33.145,Dead man!
00:13:36.732,00:13:38.567,We got a dead man walking here!
00:13:40.236,00:13:41.445,Dead man walking!
00:13:47.618,00:13:48.994,That's enough.
00:14:12.226,00:14:14.603,"Am I gonna have any trouble with you, big boy?"
00:14:19.733,00:14:20.776,Can you talk?
00:14:42.006,00:14:43.257,Come on.
00:14:48.554,00:14:53.475,"Percy, they're moving house down in the infirmary."
00:14:54.310,00:14:57.271,Why don't you go see if they could use some help?
00:14:58.105,00:14:59.648,No. They got all the men they need.
00:15:00.399,00:15:01.984,Why don't you just go and make sure?
00:15:04.069,00:15:08.490,"-Uh-uh. -I don't care where you go, Percy, just as long as it's not here at this very moment."
00:15:12.828,00:15:14.163,All right.
00:15:27.259,00:15:29.219,"God, you bust my finger."
00:15:29.553,00:15:32.139,"I wiped that grin off your shit-poked face, didn't I?"
00:15:32.222,00:15:34.475,"God damn it, Percy, get the hell off my block!"
00:15:39.688,00:15:40.689,Uh-huh.
00:15:48.697,00:15:51.951,"We're gonna get that looked at, Del. In the meantime, you just stay quiet."
00:15:52.785,00:15:54.495,Yeah. Yeah.
00:15:58.832,00:16:03.170,"I let Harry take those chains off you, you gonna be nice?"
00:16:20.437,00:16:21.855,Your name is John Coffey.
00:16:22.398,00:16:24.149,"Yes, sir, boss."
00:16:24.233,00:16:27.194,"Like the drink, only not spelt the same."
00:16:27.945,00:16:29.363,"Oh, you can spell, can you?"
00:16:30.239,00:16:31.991,"Just my name, boss."
00:16:33.867,00:16:35.911,J-O...
00:16:36.537,00:16:38.539,My name is Paul Edgecomb.
00:16:39.665,00:16:45.462,"If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell or Mr. Stanton, these gentlemen right there."
00:16:48.048,00:16:49.174,Questions?
00:16:49.925,00:16:52.261,Do you leave the light on after bedtime?
00:16:55.014,00:17:01.103,"'Cause I get a little scared in the dark sometime, if it's a strange place."
00:17:06.650,00:17:09.862,It stays pretty bright around here all night long.
00:17:10.904,00:17:13.407,We always keep a few lights burning out in the corridor.
00:17:14.616,00:17:16.160,The corridor?
00:17:18.162,00:17:19.455,Right out there.
00:17:47.816,00:17:49.234,You can sit.
00:18:11.590,00:18:13.592,"I couldn't help it, boss."
00:18:14.301,00:18:17.304,"I tried to take it back, but it was too late."
00:18:22.684,00:18:27.439,"Dean, pull Delacroix's card, take him down to the infirmary, see if those fingers are broken."
00:18:27.523,00:18:28.774,"-Yes, sir. -Of course they're broken."
00:18:28.857,00:18:30.609,I heard the bones crack.
00:18:30.692,00:18:33.654,Did you hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in?
00:18:33.737,00:18:35.697,"How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison heard."
00:18:36.657,00:18:37.866,Goddamn Percy.
00:18:38.826,00:18:41.453,You'll probably have to answer for sending him off the Mile.
00:18:41.537,00:18:44.289,Hmm. I'll chew that food when I have to.
00:18:45.165,00:18:46.458,Right now I wanna hear about this new inmate.
00:18:46.542,00:18:48.085,"Aside from how big he is, okay?"
00:18:52.464,00:18:54.758,"Oh, he seems meek enough."
00:18:54.842,00:18:56.426,"-Is he retarded, you figure? -Mmm-hmm."
00:18:57.386,00:18:59.555,Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute.
00:18:59.638,00:19:03.016,"Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done."
00:19:06.645,00:19:08.564,Make your blood curdle.
00:19:32.546,00:19:34.173,"What? For God's sake, what?"
00:19:34.256,00:19:37.176,The girls! The girls are gone!
00:19:37.509,00:19:40.012,"Papa! Papa, look! There's blood."
00:19:44.683,00:19:46.059,"Oh, my God."
00:19:51.607,00:19:55.861,"God damn it, woman! Get on that phone now! You tell them we headed west."
00:19:55.944,00:19:58.739,You mind what I'm saying! We headed west!
00:19:59.364,00:20:01.575,Central! Are you on the line?
00:20:01.950,00:20:05.412,"Oh, God, please! Somebody took my little girls!"
00:20:17.466,00:20:18.967,Katie!
00:20:20.260,00:20:21.678,Cora!
00:20:52.918,00:20:54.086,Jesus.
00:20:55.337,00:20:56.505,Jesus.
00:21:07.766,00:21:08.850,I'll kill you!
00:21:12.688,00:21:14.189,I'll kill you!
00:21:42.217,00:21:44.177,I... I couldn't help it.
00:21:45.929,00:21:48.932,"I tried to take it back, but it was too late."
00:21:53.103,00:21:55.522,"Boy, you under arrest for murder."
00:22:02.654,00:22:04.698,"Well, I'm just about done."
00:22:14.041,00:22:17.419,"Hey, how's that pretty gal of yours?"
00:22:19.379,00:22:21.506,"Melinda's not so well, Paul."
00:22:22.382,00:22:23.467,Not so well at all.
00:22:25.552,00:22:26.762,More headaches?
00:22:27.471,00:22:30.182,Got laid up with another one yesterday.
00:22:30.599,00:22:32.100,Worst one yet.
00:22:32.893,00:22:37.022,I'll be taking her over to Vicksburg next day or so for some tests.
00:22:37.773,00:22:40.317,Head X-rays and who knows what else.
00:22:40.734,00:22:43.028,She is scared to death.
00:22:45.614,00:22:47.532,"Truth to tell, so am I."
00:22:48.867,00:22:54.081,"If it's something they can see on the X-ray, maybe it's something they can fix."
00:22:55.207,00:22:56.374,Maybe.
00:23:01.004,00:23:02.839,This just came in.
00:23:02.923,00:23:04.591,DOE on Bitterbuck.
00:23:08.220,00:23:10.597,You didn't come all the way down here just to hand me a DOE.
00:23:11.765,00:23:15.727,I had an angry call from the state capitol about 20 minutes ago.
00:23:16.436,00:23:18.396,Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block?
00:23:18.480,00:23:19.481,It is.
00:23:21.149,00:23:30.909,"Now, I'm sure you had reason, Paul, but like it or not, the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore."
00:23:30.992,00:23:36.081,Little Percy calls his aunt and squeals like a schoolroom sissy.
00:23:38.125,00:23:42.504,He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance?
00:23:42.587,00:23:45.465,Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand?
00:23:45.549,00:23:48.009,I didn't hear that part. I'm sure she didn't either.
00:23:48.093,00:23:52.597,"The man is mean and careless and stupid, and that's a bad combination in a place like this."
00:23:53.515,00:23:55.600,"Sooner or later, he's gonna get somebody hurt or worse."
00:23:55.684,00:23:57.727,"Stick with it, Paul."
00:23:57.811,00:23:59.604,It may not be much longer.
00:23:59.688,00:24:03.567,I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge.
00:24:04.401,00:24:07.112,Briar Ridge? The mental hospital.
00:24:07.195,00:24:08.405,Administration job.
00:24:08.822,00:24:10.448,Better pay.
00:24:10.532,00:24:11.783,Hmm.
00:24:11.867,00:24:13.910,Then why is he still here?
00:24:15.620,00:24:18.206,He can get that application pushed through.
00:24:18.665,00:24:19.708,Hmm.
00:24:20.458,00:24:23.545,"Hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants."
00:24:24.379,00:24:26.214,You know what I think?
00:24:28.216,00:24:31.303,I think he just wants to see one cook up close.
00:24:34.681,00:24:37.809,"Well, he'll get his chance, then, won't he?"
00:24:39.519,00:24:41.980,Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on.
00:24:42.063,00:24:46.568,"In the meantime, -you'll keep the peace? -Of course."
00:24:48.486,00:24:49.696,Of course.
00:24:56.286,00:25:01.708,"Hal, you give Melinda my love, okay?"
00:25:01.791,00:25:05.253,I'm sure that X-ray will turn out to be nothing at all.
00:25:07.464,00:25:08.715,You bet.
00:25:37.410,00:25:38.787,"-Hey, you. -Hey."
00:25:39.746,00:25:41.081,The music too loud?
00:25:43.124,00:25:46.753,"There's just this big, empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps."
00:25:56.638,00:25:58.890,Worried about Melinda and Hal?
00:25:59.516,00:26:01.559,Is that what's got you up?
00:26:01.977,00:26:07.065,"Yeah, that and things."
00:26:07.941,00:26:09.150,Things.
00:26:13.822,00:26:16.157,We got a new inmate today.
00:26:17.534,00:26:19.327,Simple-minded fella.
00:26:20.954,00:26:23.081,Do I wanna know what he did?
00:26:24.207,00:26:25.500,-No. -Mmm.
00:26:26.751,00:26:29.170,Things that happen in this world...
00:26:30.422,00:26:32.549,It's a wonder God allows it.
00:26:37.053,00:26:39.097,Why don't you come to bed?
00:26:39.723,00:26:42.434,I think I have something to help you sleep.
00:26:43.601,00:26:45.895,Mmm. You can have all you want.
00:26:47.522,00:26:50.150,I still got something wrong with my waterworks.
00:26:50.233,00:26:52.444,I don't wanna pass it on to you.
00:26:52.527,00:26:54.946,-Have you seen Doc Bishop yet? -No.
00:26:58.158,00:27:02.996,"Because he's just gonna want me to take sulfa tablets, and I'll spend the rest of the week puking in every corner in my office."
00:27:03.079,00:27:07.042,It will run its course all by itself. Thank you very much for your concern.
00:27:10.128,00:27:11.588,Poor old guy.
00:27:13.923,00:27:14.966,Oh.
00:27:32.567,00:27:33.610,Yeah?
00:27:39.115,00:27:43.578,I guess the legislature loosened up the purse strings enough to hire on a new guard.
00:27:52.504,00:27:54.005,Look again.
00:27:54.089,00:27:57.050,He's right there.
00:28:06.017,00:28:08.853,It ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people this way.
00:28:09.604,00:28:10.688,Maybe it's rabid.
00:28:10.772,00:28:12.065,"-Oh, yeah, yeah. -Oh, my Christ."
00:28:12.148,00:28:14.984,"-Yeah, it could be. -Oh, the big mouse expert."
00:28:18.154,00:28:20.490,"What, you see him foaming at the mouth, Mouse Man?"
00:28:20.698,00:28:21.950,I don't see its mouth at all.
00:28:31.709,00:28:33.211,"Oh, Brutal, no."
00:28:33.294,00:28:36.297,-We'll be hip-deep in mice around here. -I just wanna see what he'll do.
00:28:36.798,00:28:38.883,"In the interest of science, like."
00:29:19.507,00:29:21.634,He's in the damn restraint room.
00:29:21.718,00:29:26.181,"And you just know he's chewing the padding out of the walls, making himself a nice little nest."
00:29:31.603,00:29:32.937,All right.
00:29:33.688,00:29:35.857,Let's go get the damn mouse.
00:29:49.329,00:29:51.122,Saw me a mouse go by.
00:29:51.748,00:29:53.541,Can't put anything over on you.
00:30:07.889,00:30:09.557,-Yeah. All right. -Here we go.
00:30:26.908,00:30:28.201,You let him get past you.
00:30:28.910,00:30:31.412,"No, I did not. I've been here all the time."
00:30:31.496,00:30:33.498,Then where the hell is he?
00:30:33.581,00:30:35.333,"Well, I don't know."
00:30:37.502,00:30:42.090,Three grown men outsmarted by a mouse.
00:30:46.427,00:30:50.056,"bright side is, all this commotion probably scared him off for good."
00:30:52.851,00:30:55.562,"Yeah, that's the last we'll see of him."
00:31:46.821,00:31:48.823,You little son of a bitch.
00:31:53.661,00:31:58.166,"There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought Brutal was pulling my leg."
00:31:59.334,00:32:01.169,-And that's a goddamn mouse. -Yeah.
00:32:02.211,00:32:07.216,"Brute said he was in here last night, begging for food."
00:32:07.634,00:32:09.677,He comes right on up to the desk.
00:32:11.012,00:32:12.597,"-Give him some room, Percy. -Huh?"
00:32:12.680,00:32:15.099,"-Yeah, see what he does. -All right."
00:33:03.690,00:33:06.734,"Percy, are you crazy, you little son of a bitch?"
00:33:07.235,00:33:09.070,-I'm gonna kill you! -Percy!
00:33:10.613,00:33:13.408,-I'm gonna take you out! -Percy! Percy!
00:33:13.491,00:33:17.537,You little vermin! I'm gonna stomp your life out!
00:33:17.620,00:33:19.372,"It's just a little mouse, dumb merde."
00:33:19.455,00:33:21.749,You ugly little piece of...
00:33:24.919,00:33:30.091,"-Percy! -I'm gonna rip your diseased head off, you little piece of shit!"
00:33:35.096,00:33:37.598,Pipe down. I'm talking to you.
00:33:41.602,00:33:43.104,Percy.
00:33:51.279,00:33:53.114,Percy met your mouse.
00:33:55.742,00:33:57.535,It's in here somewhere.
00:33:57.618,00:33:59.871,I'm gonna squish the little son of a bitch.
00:34:02.623,00:34:05.168,"Percy, we already tried that."
00:34:07.336,00:34:08.337,Huh?
00:34:08.713,00:34:10.214,What'd you say?
00:34:10.298,00:34:11.966,I said that we...
00:34:16.095,00:34:18.765,Knock yourself out. Hope you nail the bastard.
00:34:33.654,00:34:35.865,"Gosh. He ain't in there, huh?"
00:34:36.449,00:34:38.743,Don't that beat the mousy band?
00:34:42.038,00:34:47.502,"Percy, you wanna think about what you were doing just now?"
00:34:47.794,00:34:51.005,I was trying to get the mouse. Are you blind?
00:34:51.589,00:34:56.886,"You also scared the living crap out of me and Bill, not to mention the inmates."
00:34:57.220,00:34:58.596,So what?
00:34:58.679,00:35:02.183,"They aren't in cradle school, in case you didn't notice."
00:35:02.850,00:35:05.061,Although you treat 'em that way half the time.
00:35:05.144,00:35:08.356,"We don't scare them any more than we have to, Percy."
00:35:08.439,00:35:12.318,-They're under enough strain as it is. -Men under strain can snap.
00:35:13.027,00:35:20.576,"Hurt themselves and hurt others. That's why our job is talking, not yelling."
00:35:21.536,00:35:24.831,You'd do better to think of this place like it's an intensive care ward of a hospital.
00:35:25.373,00:35:28.459,I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in.
00:35:29.168,00:35:30.545,That's all.
00:35:31.420,00:35:33.631,Anybody doesn't like it? Hmm?
00:35:33.714,00:35:35.466,You can kiss my ass.
00:35:39.053,00:35:40.304,Try it.
00:35:40.388,00:35:42.807,You'll be on the bread lines before the week is out.
00:35:57.238,00:35:59.448,"We all know who your connections are, Percy."
00:36:00.074,00:36:03.744,"You ever threaten a man on this block again, we all gonna have a go."
00:36:04.495,00:36:05.830,Job be damned.
00:36:08.457,00:36:09.750,You done?
00:36:13.087,00:36:15.173,Get all this shit back in the restraining room.
00:36:15.256,00:36:17.216,You are cluttering up my Mile.
00:36:39.447,00:36:43.326,"Arlen, your daughter and her family are here."
00:36:49.749,00:36:53.085,Let's move. I want at least two rehearsals before he gets back.
00:36:57.006,00:36:58.966,"Uh, settle down, settle down!"
00:36:59.050,00:37:01.219,Rehearsing now. Everybody settle!
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.262,"Arlen Bitterbuck, step forward."
00:37:03.888,00:37:07.308,"Stepping forward, stepping forward, stepping forward."
00:37:07.391,00:37:10.853,"-Is his head properly shaved? -Nope. It's all dandruffy, and it smells."
00:37:10.937,00:37:13.814,"I will take that as a yes. Let's go, Arlen."
00:37:14.857,00:37:24.075,"Walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Mile."
00:37:24.158,00:37:27.245,"I'm getting to my knees. I'm praying, praying."
00:37:27.328,00:37:30.039,Lord is my shepherd and so forth and so on.
00:37:30.289,00:37:34.669,I'm sorry for all the bad shit I've done and people I've tramped on and everything.
00:37:35.044,00:37:40.299,"And I hope they forgive me, and I'll never do it again, that's for sure."
00:37:40.549,00:37:46.555,"Paul, we're not gonna have some Cherokee medicine man in here, hooping, hollering and shaking his dick, are we?"
00:37:49.141,00:37:50.768,Getting right with Jesus.
00:37:50.851,00:37:53.020,"Do it quietly, you old gink!"
00:37:53.980,00:37:56.774,"As I was saying, I don't believe they actually shake their dicks, Harry."
00:37:57.775,00:38:01.362,"Be that as it may, Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we've got Reverend Schuster coming in."
00:38:01.445,00:38:05.157,"Oh, he's good. He's fast, too. Doesn't get 'em all worked up."
00:38:05.241,00:38:08.286,"On your feet. Come on, Toot. You prayed enough for one day."
00:38:08.369,00:38:14.625,"Getting to my feet. Walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Mile, walking the Green Mile."
00:38:14.917,00:38:16.460,Walking the Mile.
00:38:16.544,00:38:18.337,Walking in the Mile.
00:38:19.380,00:38:21.048,Sitting down now.
00:38:22.049,00:38:23.050,Sitting down.
00:38:23.676,00:38:25.594,I'm taking a seat in Old Sparky.
00:38:26.053,00:38:27.054,What do I do?
00:38:36.564,00:38:38.107,Getting strapped.
00:38:39.233,00:38:40.860,Getting clamped.
00:38:42.570,00:38:44.071,Gettin' wired.
00:38:46.073,00:38:47.408,All right.
00:38:48.451,00:38:50.328,Getting all electrode.
00:38:58.502,00:39:01.672,Roll on one means I turn the generator up full.
00:39:01.756,00:39:04.008,You see the lights go brighter in half the prison.
00:39:06.010,00:39:12.058,"you've been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state."
00:39:12.600,00:39:14.935,You have anything to say before your sentence is carried out?
00:39:15.436,00:39:16.520,Yeah.
00:39:16.937,00:39:21.650,"I want a fried chicken dinner with gravy on the taters, and I want to shit in your hat."
00:39:22.276,00:39:26.572,I got to have Mae West sit on my face 'cause I'm one horny motherfucker.
00:39:31.869,00:39:32.995,You bastard.
00:39:37.666,00:39:38.709,Quiet! Shut up!
00:39:38.793,00:39:40.669,"-Shut up! -Sorry, boss."
00:39:41.670,00:39:45.091,"Toot, one more remark like that, I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real."
00:39:46.133,00:39:48.511,And I'll have one less crazy old trusty in the world.
00:39:49.387,00:39:50.721,It was pretty funny.
00:39:50.805,00:39:51.847,That's why I don't like it.
00:39:51.931,00:39:53.474,We'll be doing this for real tomorrow night.
00:39:54.141,00:39:57.478,I don't want anybody remembering some stupid joke like that and getting going again.
00:39:58.729,00:40:01.065,You ever try not to laugh in church when something funny gets stuck in your head?
00:40:01.148,00:40:03.275,It's the same goddamn thing.
00:40:04.151,00:40:06.404,"I'm sorry, Paul. You're right."
00:40:06.487,00:40:07.988,Let's keep going.
00:40:08.072,00:40:09.240,Harry.
00:40:13.744,00:40:15.329,Soak the sponge.
00:40:23.838,00:40:25.423,And I'm putting on my cap.
00:40:25.506,00:40:27.466,Why's he putting that sponge on his head?
00:40:27.550,00:40:30.594,"Conducts electricity directly to the brain, fast like a bullet."
00:40:31.762,00:40:34.056,You don't ever throw the switch on a man without that.
00:40:45.067,00:40:46.861,I'm getting the cap.
00:40:53.159,00:40:58.956,the electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead in accordance with state law.
00:40:59.707,00:41:01.834,God have mercy on your soul.
00:41:03.335,00:41:04.420,Amen.
00:41:07.047,00:41:08.090,Roll on two.
00:41:11.969,00:41:12.970,And that's that.
00:41:16.724,00:41:19.477,I'm frying! I'm frying!
00:41:21.812,00:41:23.939,I'm a done tom turkey!
00:41:26.567,00:41:28.277,This is a shocking experience!
00:41:30.237,00:41:33.157,One of the witnesses showed up a day early.
00:41:40.372,00:41:42.958,"All right. Let's do it again, and let's get it right this time."
00:41:43.417,00:41:45.753,Get that idiot out of the chair.
00:42:45.604,00:42:56.865,"Do you think if a man sincerely repents on what he done wrong, that he might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him, and live there forever?"
00:42:59.827,00:43:01.579,Could that be what heaven's like?
00:43:03.038,00:43:05.666,I just about believe that very thing.
00:43:08.794,00:43:09.837,Hmm.
00:43:11.839,00:43:14.300,Had me a young wife when I was 18.
00:43:15.676,00:43:19.555,Spent our first summer in the mountains. Made love every night.
00:43:21.015,00:43:27.396,"And she'd lie there after, bare-breasted in the firelight."
00:43:28.772,00:43:31.775,And we'd talk sometimes till the sun come up.
00:43:35.154,00:43:37.031,That was my best time.
00:44:00.429,00:44:01.972,You'll do fine.
00:44:39.802,00:44:45.516,"electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with state law."
00:45:08.497,00:45:09.706,Roll on two.
00:45:54.334,00:45:55.377,Again.
00:46:04.344,00:46:08.307,Drop us a card from hell. Let us know if it's hot enough.
00:46:11.602,00:46:13.520,He's paid what he owed.
00:46:14.146,00:46:16.440,He's square with the house again.
00:46:16.523,00:46:19.026,So keep your goddamn hands off him.
00:46:39.296,00:46:41.340,What's up his ass?
00:46:41.423,00:46:42.758,You.
00:46:43.675,00:46:45.969,"Always. You, Percy."
00:46:46.845,00:46:50.057,"Oh, you gotta hate the new boy? That the way it is around here?"
00:46:52.017,00:46:55.229,Why don't you just move on? Take that job at Briar Ridge?
00:46:55.938,00:46:58.440,"Hmm? Oh, yeah. I know all about it."
00:46:59.233,00:47:02.402,Sounds to me like a pretty good job.
00:47:04.071,00:47:07.282,"Yeah, I might just take it, too, soon as you put me out front."
00:47:08.617,00:47:09.952,"Yeah, you heard me."
00:47:10.536,00:47:13.121,I want Brutal's spot for the next execution.
00:47:16.750,00:47:18.835,"Seeing a man die, now that's not enough."
00:47:18.919,00:47:21.171,You gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook.
00:47:21.255,00:47:23.257,"I just wanna be out front, is all."
00:47:24.883,00:47:26.885,Come on. One time.
00:47:28.095,00:47:29.680,And then you know what?
00:47:29.763,00:47:32.516,You'll be rid of me. I swear.
00:47:33.058,00:47:34.309,And if l say no?
00:47:36.061,00:47:39.356,"Well, l might just stick around for good."
00:47:40.232,00:47:41.984,Make me a career of this.
00:47:43.443,00:47:44.778,Boss.
00:48:37.664,00:48:38.999,You are not gonna believe this.
00:48:49.426,00:48:50.761,Look.
00:48:52.387,00:48:54.431,I done tame me that mouse.
00:48:55.891,00:48:57.267,We see that.
00:48:57.351,00:49:01.521,"Oh, oh. Watch this. Watch what he do."
00:49:09.404,00:49:10.405,Ain't he something now?
00:49:12.240,00:49:14.534,"He's smart, Mr. Jingles."
00:49:14.618,00:49:16.745,-Mr. Jingles? -That his name.
00:49:17.329,00:49:19.206,He whispered in my ear.
00:49:20.040,00:49:21.208,"Hey, Captain."
00:49:21.291,00:49:24.878,Could I have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here with me?
00:49:24.961,00:49:27.631,I notice your English gets better when you want something.
00:49:28.006,00:49:29.883,Wanna see what else he can do?
00:49:30.634,00:49:32.636,"Hmm? Watch, watch, watch."
00:49:33.136,00:49:36.181,"Mr. Jingle? Mr. Jingle, wanna play fetch?"
00:49:38.934,00:49:40.936,"Play fetch. Watch, watch, watch."
00:50:00.789,00:50:03.125,He fetch it every time. Every time.
00:50:03.917,00:50:08.338,"That's some smart mouse, Del. Like he a circus mouse or somethin'."
00:50:10.924,00:50:14.094,"Correct. That just what he is, too. He's a circus mouse."
00:50:14.302,00:50:16.138,"When I get out of here, he's gonna make me rich."
00:50:16.722,00:50:19.141,You just watch and see if he don't do that.
00:50:19.224,00:50:21.393,Play fetch? We play fetch again?
00:50:24.271,00:50:26.398,"Looks like you found yourself a new friend there, Del."
00:50:27.190,00:50:28.525,Don't hurt him.
00:50:30.110,00:50:32.446,-Okay? -Is that the one l chased?
00:50:33.071,00:50:35.157,"Yeah, that's the one."
00:50:35.240,00:50:38.201,Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles.
00:50:39.453,00:50:40.454,Is that so?
00:50:41.872,00:50:43.540,Del's been asking for a box.
00:50:44.291,00:50:46.084,"Thinks the mouse will sleep in it, I guess."
00:50:46.376,00:50:48.003,Might keep it for a pet.
00:50:50.630,00:50:51.798,What do you think?
00:50:52.966,00:51:01.433,"You know what? We ought to find a cigar box, and, uh, get some cotton batting from the dispensary to line it with."
00:51:02.559,00:51:04.186,Yeah.
00:51:04.269,00:51:06.396,Yeah. That should do real nice.
00:51:16.698,00:51:18.700,Man said get a cigar box.
00:51:35.008,00:51:36.468,"Hal, you wanted to see me?"
00:51:37.344,00:51:38.428,Yeah.
00:51:39.221,00:51:40.764,Close the door.
00:51:48.146,00:51:49.439,So you know...
00:51:51.274,00:51:53.693,You got a new prisoner coming in here tomorrow.
00:51:54.820,00:51:56.404,William Wharton.
00:51:57.364,00:52:00.534,He's what you call a problem child.
00:52:02.160,00:52:05.038,Got Billy the Kid tattooed on his left arm.
00:52:06.081,00:52:12.712,"Been rambling all over the state last few years, causing all kinds of trouble."
00:52:13.421,00:52:15.423,Finally hit the big time.
00:52:16.883,00:52:19.636,Killed three people in a holdup.
00:52:20.387,00:52:22.597,One of them a pregnant woman.
00:52:24.850,00:52:26.601,Bad news all around.
00:52:28.603,00:52:29.688,Hal?
00:52:41.366,00:52:42.576,"It's a tumor, Paul."
00:52:44.286,00:52:45.787,A brain tumor.
00:52:47.747,00:52:51.293,They got X-ray pictures of it.
00:52:53.295,00:52:55.338,"It's the size of a lemon, they said."
00:52:58.508,00:53:06.433,"And way down deep inside, where they can't operate."
00:53:08.518,00:53:10.270,I haven't told her.
00:53:11.938,00:53:13.607,I can't think how.
00:53:17.777,00:53:29.623,"For the life of me, Paul, I can't think how to tell my wife she's going to die."
00:54:28.348,00:54:29.349,Oh.
00:54:29.891,00:54:30.934,Ah.
00:54:35.230,00:54:36.314,Aah.
00:54:54.290,00:54:56.126,"Oh... Oh, God."
00:54:57.168,00:54:58.712,"Oh, God."
00:55:02.799,00:55:04.217,I'm going.
00:55:04.300,00:55:07.554,-What? -To see Dr. Bishop. I'm going.
00:55:08.722,00:55:10.223,Today.
00:55:10.682,00:55:12.892,Soon as we get that new inmate squared away.
00:55:13.560,00:55:14.853,That bad?
00:55:15.520,00:55:16.771,"Oh, yeah."
00:55:39.169,00:55:41.296,The boy is doped to the gills.
00:55:42.714,00:55:43.923,Hmm?
00:55:44.257,00:55:45.425,"Dean, hand me them clothes."
00:55:48.553,00:55:50.138,William Wharton?
00:55:50.930,00:55:53.850,"Hey! You put on these clothes now, you hear?"
00:56:02.233,00:56:03.359,We're gonna have to do this.
00:56:07.363,00:56:09.365,Look more like a limp noodle to me.
00:56:09.991,00:56:11.284,Hey.
00:56:11.951,00:56:13.244,Hey.
00:56:13.828,00:56:15.080,"You've been declared competent, son."
00:56:16.414,00:56:17.540,You know what that means?
00:56:18.333,00:56:20.794,It means you're gonna ride the lightning. Yeah.
00:56:22.545,00:56:24.547,"Percy, could you shut up, give us a hand here?"
00:56:25.507,00:56:26.883,Hellraiser.
00:57:01.793,00:57:03.753,Look like you're running you a fever.
00:57:12.637,00:57:14.556,"I needs to see you down here, boss."
00:57:17.142,00:57:19.394,"I got things to tend to just now, John Coffey. You just..."
00:57:22.105,00:57:24.858,You just stay still in your cell.
00:57:37.078,00:57:38.329,E Block.
00:58:17.118,00:58:19.329,"Come on. Look alive, big boy."
00:59:16.427,00:59:17.637,Where you going? Where you going?
00:59:22.725,00:59:23.977,Ain't this a party now?
00:59:24.352,00:59:25.562,-Is it or what? -Let him go.
00:59:29.691,00:59:32.860,"-Shoot him! -Hit him, Percy! God damn it! Hit him."
00:59:33.361,00:59:34.779,"Hit me, you limp noodle."
00:59:34.862,00:59:37.156,"Hit him, Percy! God damn it, hit him!"
00:59:37.532,00:59:40.368,"-Come on, Percy. Hit me. -Wharton, I'm warning you."
00:59:53.673,00:59:54.841,You're a big fucker.
00:59:56.092,00:59:57.260,Where'd you come from?
01:00:12.817,01:00:14.944,That's it. Just breathe. Just breathe.
01:00:16.863,01:00:18.823,"Breathe. Breathe, boy."
01:00:22.076,01:00:23.953,Come on. Just breathe.
01:00:26.789,01:00:28.750,We thought he was doped.
01:00:30.209,01:00:33.588,Didn't we? Didn't we all of us think he was doped?
01:00:33.671,01:00:35.340,You didn't ask?
01:00:36.716,01:00:41.888,"Well, l guess that's not a mistake you'll be needing to make again anytime soon, is it?"
01:00:56.235,01:00:59.447,You go get Dean and Harry looked at. Make sure they're all right.
01:01:00.406,01:01:03.284,"Percy, you make the report to the warden for me."
01:01:04.077,01:01:05.662,Start out by saying the situation's under control.
01:01:05.745,01:01:06.788,It's not a story.
01:01:06.871,01:01:09.624,He will not appreciate you drawing out the suspense.
01:01:09.707,01:01:12.126,"Well, what about you? You're about ready to collapse."
01:01:12.210,01:01:15.213,"Ah, I've got the Mile till you all come back."
01:01:16.297,01:01:17.840,"Go on, now. Go."
01:02:01.676,01:02:05.054,"This is not a good time, John Coffey."
01:02:05.138,01:02:07.140,Not a good time at all.
01:02:07.223,01:02:11.227,"But l needs to see you, boss. I needs to talk to you."
01:02:33.499,01:02:34.709,Closer.
01:02:35.334,01:02:37.336,"Boss, you know you ain't supposed to do that."
01:02:39.005,01:02:40.965,"Mind your business, Del."
01:02:50.683,01:02:52.727,"What do you want, John Coffey?"
01:03:00.526,01:03:01.611,Help!
01:03:02.403,01:03:05.156,Help! John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!
01:03:05.364,01:03:06.949,Help!
01:03:12.872,01:03:14.540,Boss Howell! Help!
01:03:17.543,01:03:19.587,Help!
01:03:35.728,01:03:38.064,Help! Boss Howell! Boss Stanton!
01:03:38.397,01:03:41.359,"Somebody, come! John Coffey's killing Boss Edgecomb!"
01:03:41.442,01:03:43.736,"Del, for Christ sakes, shut up!"
01:04:30.616,01:04:32.743,What did you just do to me?
01:04:34.871,01:04:36.455,I helped it.
01:04:37.623,01:04:39.250,Didn't l help it?
01:04:40.293,01:04:42.128,"I just took it back, is all."
01:04:43.462,01:04:45.298,"Awful tired now, boss."
01:04:46.465,01:04:47.800,Dog-tired.
01:06:17.723,01:06:20.226,"Hey, honey. How you feeling?"
01:06:22.353,01:06:24.563,"Oh, not too bad."
01:06:26.273,01:06:27.400,What did the doctor say?
01:06:30.403,01:06:32.196,"Oh, you know doctors."
01:06:32.613,01:06:34.407,"Gobbledygook, mostly."
01:06:35.491,01:06:36.951,Gobbledygook.
01:06:52.258,01:06:53.884,Having stew tonight.
01:07:04.061,01:07:05.771,What are you doing?
01:07:12.611,01:07:14.488,What does it feel like?
01:07:15.156,01:07:17.491,"Well, l know what it feels like."
01:07:21.454,01:07:23.289,It feels great.
01:07:57.615,01:07:59.325,-Paul. -Yeah?
01:07:59.950,01:08:02.661,-Not that I'm complaining... -Uh-huh.
01:08:03.954,01:08:07.416,But we haven't gone four times in one night since we were 19.
01:08:07.500,01:08:10.169,"-Yeah, we did, at your mom's, yeah. -Mmm-hmm."
01:08:11.670,01:08:13.881,Wanna tell me what's going on?
01:08:17.301,01:08:18.677,Well...
01:08:20.179,01:08:26.602,"See, the thing is I never actually made it in to Dr. Bishop's yesterday."
01:08:30.064,01:08:32.525,"Brutal, Paul. Listen."
01:08:33.025,01:08:35.694,I'm thinking of taking the morning off sick.
01:08:35.778,01:08:37.363,You cover the fort for me?
01:08:38.531,01:08:40.866,That's swell. Thanks.
01:08:43.869,01:08:45.788,Okay. Okay.
01:08:51.877,01:08:53.003,You're sure you ought to do this?
01:08:55.506,01:08:57.383,I'm not sure what I'm sure of.
01:09:14.567,01:09:16.986,"Burt, you got some company."
01:09:18.237,01:09:19.989,Can l offer you a cold drink?
01:09:20.072,01:09:22.741,"Oh, yes, ma'am. A cold drink would be fine. Thank you."
01:09:23.492,01:09:26.704,"Mr. Hammersmith, your office said I might find you at home today."
01:09:26.787,01:09:28.455,Hope I'm not troubling you.
01:09:29.123,01:09:31.333,"Well, that depends, Mr..."
01:09:31.417,01:09:35.421,Paul Edgecomb. I'm E Block supervisor up on Cold Mountain.
01:09:36.714,01:09:38.174,The Green Mile.
01:09:38.257,01:09:41.260,"Yeah, I've heard of it. Lost a few clients your way."
01:09:42.136,01:09:43.846,I'd like to ask you about one of 'em.
01:09:46.056,01:09:48.017,-Have a seat. -Thank you.
01:09:52.688,01:09:53.814,Which client?
01:09:56.025,01:09:58.444,Now you got my curiosity aroused.
01:09:59.028,01:10:00.362,John Coffey.
01:10:00.446,01:10:01.447,Ah.
01:10:01.530,01:10:03.073,Coffey.
01:10:03.157,01:10:04.450,He causing you problems?
01:10:04.825,01:10:08.621,"No. No, can't say he is. He doesn't like the dark and cries on occasion."
01:10:08.704,01:10:10.497,But other than that...
01:10:10.581,01:10:13.876,"He cries, does he? Well, got a lot to cry about, I'd say."
01:10:14.168,01:10:15.711,You know what he did.
01:10:16.378,01:10:18.172,I read the court transcript.
01:10:19.590,01:10:21.926,"-Thank you, missus. -My pleasure."
01:10:23.093,01:10:26.096,Kids! Lunch is about ready. Y'all come on up.
01:10:27.890,01:10:30.976,What exactly are you trying to find out?
01:10:31.769,01:10:34.104,I've wondered if he ever did anything like that before.
01:10:35.564,01:10:37.483,Why? Has he said anything?
01:10:37.566,01:10:43.280,"No, but a man who does a thing like that has often developed a taste for it over time."
01:10:43.364,01:10:48.494,It occurred to me that it might be easy enough to follow his back trail. Find out.
01:10:49.828,01:10:53.332,"A man his size, and colored to boot, can't be that hard to trace."
01:10:53.832,01:10:57.086,"You'd think so, but you'd be wrong."
01:10:57.169,01:10:59.338,"Believe me, we tried."
01:11:00.005,01:11:01.507,Like he dropped out of the sky.
01:11:03.008,01:11:04.593,How can that be?
01:11:04.677,01:11:08.430,We're in a depression. A third of the country's out of work.
01:11:08.973,01:11:13.227,"People are drifting by the thousands, looking for jobs, for that greener grass."
01:11:13.310,01:11:16.355,Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't get noticed everywhere he goes.
01:11:17.231,01:11:19.525,Not until he kills a couple of little girls.
01:11:20.401,01:11:24.405,"He is, uh, strange, l admit."
01:11:24.822,01:11:28.575,But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him.
01:11:29.535,01:11:31.996,"I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith."
01:11:32.079,01:11:34.123,I deal with them day in and day out.
01:11:35.874,01:11:38.627,You didn't come up here to ask me whether he might have killed before.
01:11:38.711,01:11:40.963,You came up here to see if l think he did it at all.
01:11:45.968,01:11:48.262,One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.
01:11:48.345,01:11:50.472,He was found with the victims in his arms.
01:11:50.556,01:11:52.224,And yet you defended him.
01:11:53.350,01:11:55.394,Everyone is entitled to a defense.
01:11:58.314,01:11:59.606,Y'all listen to your mama now!
01:12:04.153,01:12:06.113,I'll tell you something.
01:12:06.864,01:12:10.576,"And you listen close, too, because it might be something you need to know."
01:12:10.659,01:12:12.036,I'm listening.
01:12:13.412,01:12:14.538,We had us a dog.
01:12:15.581,01:12:17.666,Just a sweet mongrel.
01:12:17.750,01:12:19.251,You know the kind.
01:12:20.669,01:12:24.006,"Well, in many ways, a good mongrel dog is like a Negro."
01:12:24.923,01:12:26.633,You get to know it.
01:12:26.967,01:12:34.433,"Often, you get to love it. It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you think it loves you."
01:12:36.518,01:12:40.606,"If you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never have to find out any different."
01:12:41.732,01:12:43.108,My wife and l were not so lucky.
01:12:45.903,01:12:47.446,"Caleb, come here for a second."
01:12:48.781,01:12:50.115,Come here.
01:12:51.450,01:12:52.659,"Please, son."
01:12:54.286,01:12:56.163,He still has the one good eye.
01:12:58.123,01:13:02.628,I suppose he's lucky not to be completely blind.
01:13:05.672,01:13:09.176,We get down on our knees and thank God for that much at least.
01:13:10.052,01:13:11.512,"Right, Caleb?"
01:13:13.972,01:13:15.307,"Okay, go on in now."
01:13:18.811,01:13:21.480,That dog attacked my boy for no reason.
01:13:22.314,01:13:24.316,Just got it in his mind one day.
01:13:25.234,01:13:26.860,The same with John Coffey.
01:13:26.944,01:13:31.115,He was sorry afterwards. Of that l have no doubt.
01:13:31.824,01:13:36.120,But those little girls stayed raped and murdered.
01:13:36.995,01:13:38.997,Maybe he'd never done it before.
01:13:40.791,01:13:42.751,My dog never bit before.
01:13:44.670,01:13:47.339,But l didn't concern myself with that.
01:13:48.424,01:13:52.302,I went out there with my rifle and grabbed his collar and blew his brains out.
01:13:53.762,01:13:54.888,Is Coffey guilty?
01:13:57.891,01:13:59.601,"Yes, he is."
01:14:00.144,01:14:01.145,Don't you doubt it.
01:14:02.229,01:14:04.773,And don't you turn your back on him.
01:14:05.566,01:14:09.445,You may get away with it once or even a hundred times.
01:14:10.571,01:14:15.784,"But in the end, you'll get bit."
01:14:28.297,01:14:30.841,"Oh, me! Oh, my!"
01:14:34.887,01:14:36.138,John.
01:14:37.681,01:14:39.766,I'm smelling me some corn bread.
01:14:40.350,01:14:42.102,It's from my missus.
01:14:45.898,01:14:48.233,She wanted to thank you.
01:14:49.651,01:14:51.069,Thank me for what?
01:14:51.487,01:14:53.030,"Well, you know."
01:14:57.618,01:14:59.161,Helping you with what?
01:14:59.870,01:15:01.121,You know.
01:15:03.832,01:15:05.250,Oh.
01:15:07.544,01:15:09.505,Was your missus pleased?
01:15:11.340,01:15:13.008,Several times.
01:15:28.524,01:15:32.069,"Oh, John, I can smell that from over here. I surely can."
01:15:34.905,01:15:37.199,Can l give Del and Mr. Jingles some?
01:15:37.783,01:15:41.370,"Well, it's yours, John. You can do with it as you please."
01:15:44.456,01:15:47.960,Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.
01:15:48.627,01:15:52.297,"Hey! What about me? I'm gonna get some, too, ain't l?"
01:15:54.466,01:15:57.594,"It's yours, John. As you please."
01:16:06.687,01:16:08.897,Courtesy of the gentleman across the way.
01:16:14.903,01:16:16.989,I thank you. Mr. Jingle thank you.
01:16:17.072,01:16:18.824,"My mama would thank you too, but she dead."
01:16:19.491,01:16:20.701,Welcome.
01:16:20.784,01:16:22.786,Hey! What about me?
01:16:22.869,01:16:26.081,"Don't you hold out on me, you big dummy nigger."
01:16:29.293,01:16:31.753,"Ooh, here come the boss man."
01:16:32.671,01:16:35.132,You'll keep a civil tongue on my block.
01:16:46.560,01:16:48.604,You get that one for free.
01:16:49.605,01:16:51.231,But that's the last one.
01:16:55.485,01:16:59.031,"I guess I'm gonna have to pay you out for the rest, huh?"
01:17:11.460,01:17:13.003,Yee-haw!
01:17:13.086,01:17:14.129,"Good shot, weren't it?"
01:17:16.423,01:17:18.634,The look on your face!
01:17:24.598,01:17:26.808,That son of a bitch pissed on me.
01:17:28.935,01:17:32.064,I'm currently cooking up some turds to go with it.
01:17:32.439,01:17:33.982,Nice soft ones.
01:17:38.862,01:17:41.907,"We've been meaning to clean out that room for a while, haven't we?"
01:17:41.990,01:17:43.241,"Oh, yeah."
01:17:47.245,01:17:51.833,Hey. Hey! What is it now? What's it now? Moving day?
01:17:51.917,01:17:54.044,Y'all wanna come on in here and dust a little?
01:17:54.544,01:17:57.631,You can shine my knob for me while you're at it.
01:18:11.478,01:18:16.483,"You can come in here on your legs, but you'll go out on your backs."
01:18:16.566,01:18:19.277,Billy the Kid gonna guarantee you that.
01:18:20.278,01:18:23.573,"Come on, fuck-stick. No sneaking up on me this time."
01:18:23.657,01:18:25.450,We'll go man-to-man.
01:18:29.287,01:18:30.330,Piss on me?
01:18:56.982,01:18:59.693,"Come on, Wild Bill. Little walky-walky."
01:18:59.776,01:19:03.989,Don't you call me that! Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range rider!
01:19:04.406,01:19:06.575,He was just some bushwhacking John Law!
01:19:06.658,01:19:09.578,"Dumb son of a bitch sat with his back to the door, killed by a drunk."
01:19:09.661,01:19:12.372,"Oh, my suds and body. A history lesson."
01:19:12.998,01:19:15.709,"Oh, you just never know what you're gonna get when you come to work every day on the Green Mile."
01:19:18.962,01:19:20.589,"Thank you, Wild Bill."
01:19:28.722,01:19:31.600,"Not in there. Not in there. I'll be good. Fellas, I'll be good."
01:19:31.683,01:19:33.894,"Honest Injun, I will. I will."
01:19:41.526,01:19:43.278,"He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on this one."
01:19:43.361,01:19:44.529,"One, two, three."
01:19:48.533,01:19:50.243,Hey! Hey!
01:19:50.327,01:19:51.912,"Hey, hey!"
01:19:52.871,01:19:53.872,"Hey, fellers."
01:19:54.748,01:19:57.125,"Hey, it's not funny. You won't leave..."
01:20:00.587,01:20:03.799,"All I wanted me was a little corn bread, you motherfuckers!"
01:20:03.882,01:20:05.967,All I wanted me was a little corn bread!
01:20:14.392,01:20:16.686,I... I learned my lesson.
01:20:16.770,01:20:18.230,I'll be good.
01:20:31.451,01:20:32.494,"Hey, Toot."
01:20:34.663,01:20:36.665,Give you a nickel for that MoonPie.
01:21:12.909,01:21:15.161,"Ooh, ooh."
01:21:15.412,01:21:17.622,Little Black Sambo! Yo!

01:21:28.675,01:21:30.635,Where are we going? Let's go!

01:21:44.024,01:21:47.736,That MoonPie thing was pretty original. Gotta give him that.
01:21:49.863,01:21:51.156,"Oh, yeah."
01:22:06.296,01:22:10.091,"Del, grab up your things. It's a big day for you and Mr. Jingles."
01:22:10.175,01:22:11.509,What you talking about?
01:22:11.593,01:22:15.430,Important folks heard about your mouse. Wanna see him perform.
01:22:17.182,01:22:20.185,One's a politician all the way from the state capitol I believe.
01:22:22.520,01:22:24.105,You fellas coming?
01:22:24.189,01:22:30.362,"No, we got other fish to fry just now, Del, but you knock 'em for a loop, yeah."
01:22:31.404,01:22:33.239,"You knock 'em for a loop, Del."
01:22:33.657,01:22:35.659,Just like Mr. Harry says.
01:22:47.587,01:22:49.881,"All right. Let's move briskly, folks. There's not much time."
01:22:50.423,01:22:53.176,"All right, rehearsing now!"
01:22:53.259,01:22:55.804,Gotta move our ass. Ain't got much time.
01:22:56.137,01:22:59.516,I been fixing the plumbing here for ten years.
01:22:59.599,01:23:02.018,Ain't never had to wear no damn tie before.
01:23:02.102,01:23:05.480,"Well, you're the VIP today, Earl, so just shut up."
01:23:07.774,01:23:10.235,"All right, everybody, have a seat."
01:23:25.834,01:23:27.460,This is great.
01:23:36.219,01:23:44.227,"Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with state law."
01:23:45.437,01:23:47.564,God have mercy on your soul.
01:23:56.614,01:23:57.782,Roll on two.
01:24:01.911,01:24:02.912,That's that.
01:24:06.499,01:24:09.044,Very good. Very professional.
01:24:12.005,01:24:13.673,Let's do it again.
01:24:14.132,01:24:17.343,You got all the words right. It sounded just fine.
01:24:17.427,01:24:18.762,-Thank you. -Yep.
01:24:18.845,01:24:21.890,It's hard to keep a straight face when Toot's acting the goat.
01:24:21.973,01:24:34.736,"You got that chin strap good and tight because his head is gonna buck-- -So? -Oh, they love Mr. Jingles."
01:24:34.819,01:24:39.574,"They laugh over there, they cheer, they clap their hands."
01:24:40.575,01:24:42.535,"Well, that's just aces."
01:24:43.286,01:24:45.121,Isn't that something?
01:24:45.205,01:24:46.748,"You done good, old-timer."
01:24:50.835,01:24:52.670,"Yeah, we are."

01:25:09.229,01:25:10.563,"Percy, you shit."
01:25:13.399,01:25:15.610,"Come on. Del, get up."
01:25:15.693,01:25:19.239,"Del, you numb-wit. I didn't mean nothing by it."
01:25:19.572,01:25:22.408,"I was just playing. Come on, now."
01:25:31.668,01:25:35.755,"I'd rather fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, l think."
01:25:36.172,01:25:37.507,Wharton!
01:25:42.720,01:25:46.808,I let him go. I was just playing. I let him go.
01:25:46.891,01:25:49.310,I'd never hurt a hair on his pretty little head.
01:25:50.061,01:25:52.856,"Your noodle ain't limp at all, lover boy."
01:25:52.939,01:25:55.650,I think you sweet on old Billy the Kid.
01:25:56.901,01:25:59.988,"Ooh, but smell you."

01:26:17.505,01:26:20.842,"-He bust other people with a stick. -Come on, get in."
01:26:23.052,01:26:26.431,"Somebody touch him, he make water in his pants like a little baby."
01:26:28.766,01:26:29.934,Del!
01:26:30.310,01:26:31.561,Learn when to shut up.
01:26:32.770,01:26:34.272,"All right, now."
01:26:51.956,01:26:53.750,You...
01:26:53.833,01:26:59.130,"You talk about this to anyone, I'll get you all fired."
01:27:00.798,01:27:02.467,I swear that to God.
01:27:04.093,01:27:08.306,What happens on the Mile stays on the Mile. Always has.
01:27:15.438,01:27:19.317,"Yeah, you keep laughing, you French-fried faggot!"
01:27:19.817,01:27:21.819,You just keep on laughin'!

01:27:49.347,01:27:51.474,"He'd love to have a pet mouse, I bet."
01:27:54.519,01:27:57.438,How could a boy be trusted with Mr. Jingle?
01:27:57.855,01:27:59.857,Maybe forget to feed him.
01:28:00.692,01:28:02.026,How he keep up with his training?
01:28:02.110,01:28:04.320,"I mean, he just a boy, n'est-ce pas?"
01:28:04.654,01:28:06.030,Hmm.
01:28:23.756,01:28:25.800,You live out in the woods.
01:28:25.883,01:28:27.302,"Mr. Jingle, he be..."

01:28:44.235,01:28:45.778,"Tallahassee, l think."
01:28:46.195,01:28:48.156,"-Is that right, Paul? Tallahassee? -Yeah, yeah."
01:28:48.698,01:28:49.866,Tallahassee.
01:28:49.949,01:28:52.827,It's just down the road a-piece from the dog university.
01:28:56.080,01:28:59.751,"You think, uh... You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?"
01:29:00.918,01:29:02.462,You think he's got the stuff?
01:29:02.879,01:29:04.547,"Well, he is pretty smart."
01:29:05.923,01:29:07.550,What is Mouseville?
01:29:07.633,01:29:10.011,"Tourist attraction, l said."
01:29:10.094,01:29:11.804,They got this big tent you go into.
01:29:11.888,01:29:13.514,"-You have to pay? -What, are you shitting me?"
01:29:13.598,01:29:15.433,Of course you pay.
01:29:15.516,01:29:19.270,-Dime apiece. Two cents for the kids. -For the kids.
01:29:19.354,01:29:30.365,"Inside the tent they got this, uh, mouse city made out of old boxes and toilet paper rolls, little windows so you can look in."
01:29:31.282,01:29:35.286,"Plus, they got the Mouseville All-Star Circus."
01:29:36.829,01:29:39.290,"Yeah, there's mice that swing on trapeze."
01:29:39.957,01:29:43.544,Mice that roll barrels. Mice that stack coins.
01:29:47.632,01:29:48.716,"Yeah, that's it."
01:29:50.384,01:29:52.136,That's the place for Mr. Jingles.
01:29:54.972,01:29:55.973,Oh!
01:29:57.141,01:29:59.769,You gonna be a circus mouse after all.

01:30:08.152,01:30:09.195,"Oh, there he goes."
01:30:15.159,01:30:16.702,No!
01:30:28.089,01:30:29.257,You kill my mouse.
01:30:29.340,01:30:31.259,I knew I'd get him sooner or later.
01:30:32.051,01:30:33.845,"It was just a matter of time, really."
01:30:48.192,01:30:50.695,Give him to me. Might still be time.
01:31:03.666,01:31:05.376,What are you doing?
01:31:06.544,01:31:07.628,Paul?
01:31:08.880,01:31:10.631,What the hell?
01:31:13.634,01:31:14.886,Help him.
01:31:16.220,01:31:17.889,"Please, Johnny, help him."
01:31:22.435,01:31:24.145,"Oh, dear Jesus."
01:31:24.812,01:31:26.063,The tail.
01:31:26.898,01:31:28.232,Look at the tail.
01:32:54.151,01:32:55.361,You're back.
01:32:58.656,01:32:59.907,What did you do?
01:33:00.324,01:33:02.493,I helped Del's mouse.
01:33:03.494,01:33:04.912,He's a circus mouse.
01:33:05.496,01:33:08.666,Gonna live in a mouse city down in...
01:33:11.502,01:33:12.712,Florida?
01:33:15.881,01:33:17.508,"Boss, Percy bad."
01:33:18.009,01:33:19.427,He mean.
01:33:19.510,01:33:21.095,He step on Del's mouse.
01:33:22.847,01:33:24.765,"I took it back, though."
01:33:25.308,01:33:26.600,Merci.
01:33:34.275,01:33:35.860,you come along with me.
01:33:36.360,01:33:39.030,You fellas go on back to your cribbage game.
01:34:03.804,01:34:05.514,"Now, don't start in on me."
01:34:06.515,01:34:07.892,It was just a mouse.
01:34:08.893,01:34:10.895,Never belonged here in the first place.
01:34:11.395,01:34:12.813,The mouse is fine.
01:34:13.981,01:34:15.066,Just fine.
01:34:15.149,01:34:17.193,You're no better at mouse-killing than you are at...
01:34:18.069,01:34:19.862,"Hell, at anything else around here."
01:34:26.619,01:34:28.704,I heard the goddamn thing crunch.
01:34:29.372,01:34:31.457,Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay?
01:34:32.792,01:34:36.962,After all those talks we had about keeping the prisoners calm?
01:34:37.797,01:34:39.048,Aren't you relieved?
01:34:39.632,01:34:41.008,What kind of game is this?
01:34:41.092,01:34:42.218,It's no game.
01:34:42.968,01:34:44.261,See for yourself.
01:34:47.431,01:34:48.599,Go on.
01:35:01.987,01:35:04.240,Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingle.
01:35:09.120,01:35:10.538,You switched him.
01:35:10.621,01:35:12.456,"You switched him somehow, you bastards."
01:35:13.290,01:35:17.420,I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this.
01:35:17.503,01:35:20.506,"Oh, yeah, you playing with me, huh? Both of you."
01:35:20.589,01:35:22.633,"Just who the hell you think you are, huh?"
01:35:22.716,01:35:23.759,Ah!
01:35:28.055,01:35:29.348,But not for long.
01:35:33.269,01:35:34.270,My word?
01:35:34.895,01:35:41.569,"I put you out front for Del, you put in your transfer to Briar Ridge the very next day."
01:35:42.611,01:35:48.242,"Well, what if I just call up certain people and tell 'em you're harassing me?"
01:35:51.912,01:35:54.832,I promise you'll leave your share of blood on the floor.
01:35:55.332,01:35:57.501,-Over a mouse? -No!
01:35:58.461,01:36:03.090,But four men will swear you stood by while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death.
01:36:03.174,01:36:07.261,"About that, people will care. Even your uncle, the governor, will care about that."
01:36:07.344,01:36:09.305,Thing like that goes on your work record.
01:36:10.347,01:36:14.310,"Work record can follow a man around for a long, long time."
01:36:17.062,01:36:18.939,you put in for that transfer.
01:36:21.025,01:36:22.276,That's the deal.
01:36:26.489,01:36:27.823,All right.
01:36:29.241,01:36:30.367,All right.
01:36:37.541,01:36:39.793,"You make a promise to a man, you shake his hand."
01:37:42.439,01:37:43.774,"Hey, boys."
01:37:45.442,01:37:48.153,"No, now, say, Hey, Mr. Jingles."
01:38:08.048,01:38:09.216,Boss Edgecomb?
01:38:09.967,01:38:11.260,"Yes, Del?"
01:38:11.677,01:38:14.054,"Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingle, okay?"
01:38:15.806,01:38:17.891,Here. You take him.
01:38:23.814,01:38:29.903,"Del, I can't have a mouse on my shoulder while..."
01:38:31.655,01:38:32.948,You know.
01:38:37.411,01:38:39.747,"Just for now, if Del don't mind."
01:38:42.875,01:38:44.001,Yeah.
01:38:44.752,01:38:46.253,"Yeah, you take him, John."
01:38:46.337,01:38:48.631,You take him till this foolishment be done.
01:39:10.319,01:39:12.237,"You gonna take him to Florida, to that Mouseville?"
01:39:13.197,01:39:14.865,"We'll do it together, most likely."
01:39:16.700,01:39:18.285,Maybe take a little vacation time.
01:39:19.036,01:39:20.120,Yeah.
01:39:20.204,01:39:22.373,People pay a dime apiece to see him.
01:39:23.374,01:39:25.125,Two cents for the kids.
01:39:25.209,01:39:26.210,"Ain't that right, Boss Howell?"
01:39:26.293,01:39:27.628,"That's right, Del."
01:39:30.255,01:39:31.924,"You're a good man, Boss Howell."
01:39:35.594,01:39:36.929,"You, too, Boss Edgecomb."
01:39:41.183,01:39:43.852,I sure wish I could've met you guys somewheres else.
01:40:23.517,01:40:25.644,Hope he's good and scared.
01:40:25.728,01:40:29.690,Hope he knows the fires are stoked and that Satan's imps are waiting.
01:40:39.700,01:40:41.118,"Del, it's all right."
01:41:24.369,01:41:25.496,Roll on one.
01:41:41.428,01:41:44.348,You be so quiet and so still.
01:41:48.519,01:41:57.736,"Eduard Delacroix, you've been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state."
01:41:58.237,01:42:01.156,You have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
01:42:09.665,01:42:11.458,I sorry for what I...
01:42:18.799,01:42:20.676,I sorry for what I do.
01:42:21.510,01:42:23.512,I give anything to take it back.
01:42:24.972,01:42:26.390,But I can't.
01:42:27.808,01:42:29.601,God have mercy on me.
01:42:41.321,01:42:42.906,Don't forget about Mouseville.
01:42:45.784,01:42:49.621,"Hey, there's no such place."
01:42:50.581,01:42:53.584,That's just a fairy tale these guys told you to keep you quiet.
01:42:56.879,01:42:59.464,"Just thought you should know, faggot."
01:44:01.526,01:44:09.159,"Eduard Delacroix, electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead in accordance with state law."
01:44:10.994,01:44:13.163,God have mercy on your soul.
01:44:52.327,01:44:53.370,Roll on two!
01:45:12.222,01:45:13.348,What?
01:45:18.729,01:45:20.814,"Jack, the goddamn sponge is dry!"
01:45:20.897,01:45:22.315,"Well, don't you stop it!"
01:45:22.399,01:45:24.276,Don't you do it! It's too late for that.
01:45:40.083,01:45:41.793,Is this normal?
01:45:41.877,01:45:44.004,"God, the smell."
01:45:44.087,01:45:45.130,Oh.
01:45:45.756,01:45:47.090,He's cooking now!
01:45:47.174,01:45:48.425,They cooking him good!
01:45:48.884,01:45:50.594,"They're about done, I reckon!"
01:45:55.265,01:45:57.392,We're gonna have a hoedown!
01:46:04.900,01:46:06.610,He's cooking now!
01:46:07.152,01:46:10.781,We gonna have a hoedown! 'Cution gumbo.
01:46:13.617,01:46:16.328,Give me some! I'm smelling gumbo!
01:46:16.787,01:46:19.706,"I'm smelling... I said, give me some!"
01:46:24.086,01:46:25.462,I smell it!
01:46:36.973,01:46:38.058,Should I kill the juice?
01:46:38.141,01:46:39.768,"No! Roll, for chrisssake, roll!"
01:47:03.250,01:47:06.211,He's frying now! He's frying now!
01:47:06.586,01:47:08.088,He's frying now!
01:47:09.673,01:47:12.425,-Why don't you shut it down? -He's still alive.
01:47:12.509,01:47:14.344,You want me to shut down while he's still alive?
01:47:20.851,01:47:23.103,"You watch, you son of a bitch!"
01:47:24.855,01:47:27.566,"It's all right, folks! It's all under control!"
01:47:28.316,01:47:31.027,"Everybody stay calm! Please, stay calm!"
01:47:36.825,01:47:37.868,Kill it!
01:47:44.875,01:47:45.917,You do it!
01:47:46.001,01:47:47.544,"You're running this show, ain't you?"
01:48:15.906,01:48:18.408,I didn't know the sponge is supposed to be wet.
01:48:21.661,01:48:23.079,"Brutal, no!"
01:48:23.163,01:48:25.332,"-No! No! -What do you mean, No?"
01:48:25.415,01:48:27.209,How can you say no? You saw what he did!
01:48:27.292,01:48:28.335,Delacroix's dead!
01:48:28.418,01:48:30.420,"Now, there's nothing can change that, and Percy is not worth it!"
01:48:30.503,01:48:32.756,So he just gets away with it? Is that how it works?
01:48:41.598,01:48:44.100,What in the blue fuck was that?
01:48:45.936,01:48:47.479,Jesus Christ.
01:48:47.562,01:48:49.648,There's puke all over the floor up there.
01:48:50.440,01:48:51.942,And the smell.
01:48:52.943,01:48:56.947,"I got Van Hay to open both doors, but that smell won't go out for five damn years."
01:48:57.030,01:48:58.365,That's what I'm betting.
01:48:59.616,01:49:02.285,And that asshole Wharton is singing about it!
01:49:03.453,01:49:04.871,You can hear him up there!
01:49:05.497,01:49:07.499,"Can he carry a tune, Hal?"
01:49:18.885,01:49:20.512,"Okay, boys, okay."
01:49:21.513,01:49:24.474,"Now, what in the hell happened?"
01:49:24.766,01:49:25.892,An execution.
01:49:26.476,01:49:27.811,A successful one.
01:49:28.144,01:49:32.065,How in the name of Christ can you call that a success?
01:49:33.066,01:49:35.151,Eduard Delacroix is dead.
01:49:36.820,01:49:38.113,Isn't he?
01:49:42.617,01:49:44.411,-Percy? -Yeah.
01:49:45.161,01:49:46.454,Something to say?
01:49:50.333,01:49:52.836,I didn't know the sponge is supposed to be wet.
01:49:54.254,01:49:58.925,How many years you spend pissing on a toilet seat before someone told you to put it up?
01:49:59.009,01:50:00.844,"Percy fucked up, Hal."
01:50:01.469,01:50:02.721,Pure and simple.
01:50:03.513,01:50:05.598,That's your official position?
01:50:05.682,01:50:07.017,Don't you think it should be?
01:50:08.018,01:50:11.062,He's putting in for a transfer request to Briar Ridge tomorrow.
01:50:12.188,01:50:14.065,Moving on to bigger and better things.
01:50:15.025,01:50:16.109,"Isn't that right, Percy?"
01:50:18.028,01:50:19.446,Yeah. Yeah.
01:50:22.866,01:50:33.918,"Stinky, pinky Weren't Billy, Jilly, Hilly or Pa It was a French-fried Cajun Named Delacroix Whoo!"
01:50:34.002,01:50:42.552,"Barbecue, me and you Stinky, pinky Phew, phew, phew Weren't Billy, Jilly..."
01:50:43.678,01:50:47.098,You're about ten seconds away from spending the rest of your life in the padded room.
01:51:06.159,01:51:07.285,Poor old Del.
01:51:08.953,01:51:10.080,Yeah.
01:51:11.039,01:51:12.499,Poor old Del.
01:51:15.001,01:51:16.086,John?
01:51:18.755,01:51:20.006,You okay?
01:51:21.466,01:51:23.510,I could feel it from here.
01:51:24.344,01:51:25.970,What do you mean?
01:51:26.638,01:51:27.806,You could hear it.
01:51:28.473,01:51:30.016,Is that what you mean?
01:51:30.100,01:51:33.103,"-You could hear it. -He out of it now, though."
01:51:33.770,01:51:35.105,He the lucky one.
01:51:36.147,01:51:39.943,"No matter how it happened, Del the lucky one."
01:51:46.533,01:51:48.284,Where's Mr. Jingles?
01:51:49.661,01:51:51.788,He run away under that door.
01:51:53.540,01:51:55.583,Don't think he'll be back.
01:51:57.168,01:51:59.629,"He felt it too, through me."
01:52:01.172,01:52:03.383,Didn't mean to hurt him none.
01:52:03.925,01:52:06.469,All that hurt just spill out.
01:52:13.643,01:52:15.520,"Awful tired now, boss."
01:52:17.814,01:52:19.149,Dog-tired.
01:52:29.576,01:52:30.827,"Me, too."
01:53:30.929,01:53:32.347,I hate this.
01:53:33.264,01:53:34.474,I know.
01:53:56.246,01:53:58.498,-I am so happy to see you. -Oh.
01:53:59.958,01:54:01.376,Look at you.
01:54:02.710,01:54:04.587,"Well, we missed you at church."
01:54:07.090,01:54:08.424,Oh!
01:54:08.508,01:54:10.426,"Ah, my hair."
01:54:11.094,01:54:12.178,You look fine.
01:54:12.262,01:54:13.846,I'm just a mess.
01:54:19.310,01:54:21.771,She's having one of her good days.
01:54:22.355,01:54:24.148,I thank God for that.
01:54:26.609,01:54:28.278,What's a bad day?
01:54:31.864,01:54:33.533,Sometimes she's...
01:54:35.118,01:54:36.494,She's not herself anymore.
01:54:37.120,01:54:38.454,She swears.
01:54:38.955,01:54:40.290,She swears?
01:54:40.373,01:54:42.000,It just pops out.
01:54:42.792,01:54:44.836,Most awful language you can imagine.
01:54:45.545,01:54:47.630,She doesn't even know she's doing it.
01:54:49.257,01:54:51.342,I didn't know she'd ever heard words like that.
01:54:52.260,01:54:54.971,To hear her say them in her sweet voice.
01:54:59.809,01:55:01.603,"I'm glad she's having a good day, Paul."
01:55:03.438,01:55:05.440,I'm glad for you and Jan.
01:55:21.789,01:55:29.172,"Honey, if you don't tell me what's on your mind, I'm afraid I'll have to smother you with a pillow."
01:55:38.848,01:55:40.642,I'm thinking I love you.
01:55:42.894,01:55:45.605,I'm thinking I don't know what I would do if you were gone.
01:55:48.441,01:55:49.484,Oh.
01:55:52.612,01:55:55.615,I'm also thinking I'm gonna have the boys over tomorrow.
01:56:00.203,01:56:02.956,"Well, you sure do know how to cook chicken."
01:56:03.039,01:56:04.457,"Well, thank you."
01:56:04.540,01:56:07.335,"This is one delicious treat, ma'am, before I go to work."
01:56:07.418,01:56:08.962,"Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it."
01:56:09.462,01:56:10.630,"-Hey, Brutal. -Hmm."
01:56:10.713,01:56:11.881,You gonna hog all them taters?
01:56:11.965,01:56:13.132,"Yes, I am."
01:56:13.883,01:56:15.760,"-Harry, you want some taters? -Come on, now."
01:56:16.052,01:56:17.095,What?
01:56:20.056,01:56:21.557,Y'all saw what he did to the mouse.
01:56:25.353,01:56:27.647,I could've gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up.
01:56:27.730,01:56:29.399,I could've gone the rest of the year.
01:56:29.983,01:56:31.484,He did the same thing to me.
01:56:32.276,01:56:33.861,He put his hands on me.
01:56:35.196,01:56:36.906,He took my bladder infection away.
01:56:42.078,01:56:48.626,"It's true. When he came home that day, he was all better."
01:56:50.003,01:56:54.173,"Oh, now, wait. You're talking about an authentic healing?"
01:56:56.217,01:56:57.635,A praise-Jesus miracle?
01:56:58.594,01:56:59.595,I am.
01:57:00.471,01:57:01.597,"Oh, yeah."
01:57:02.098,01:57:04.600,"Well, if you say it, I accept it."
01:57:06.185,01:57:07.437,What's it got to do with us?
01:57:08.479,01:57:09.772,You're thinking about Melinda.
01:57:10.273,01:57:11.315,Melinda?
01:57:12.275,01:57:16.821,"-Melinda Moores? -Yeah. So, Paul, you really think you can help her?"
01:57:17.613,01:57:23.995,"It's not a bladder infection or even a busted mouse, but I think there might be a chance."
01:57:24.412,01:57:25.872,Hold on now.
01:57:25.955,01:57:27.957,You're talking about our jobs.
01:57:28.041,01:57:30.334,Sneak a sick woman into a cellblock?
01:57:30.418,01:57:32.462,"Oh, no. No, no. Hal would never stand for that."
01:57:33.504,01:57:34.422,You know him.
01:57:34.505,01:57:36.132,He wouldn't believe anything even if it fell on him.
01:57:36.215,01:57:39.844,So you're talking about taking John Coffey to her.
01:57:45.641,01:57:47.643,"That's more than just our jobs, Paul."
01:57:49.020,01:57:50.480,"That's prison time, we get caught."
01:57:50.563,01:57:51.898,"You're dang right, it is."
01:57:53.941,01:57:57.195,"See now, the way I figure it, you stay back on the Mile."
01:57:57.278,01:57:58.780,"That way, you can deny everything."
01:57:59.739,01:58:01.115,Why do I have to stay behind?
01:58:02.033,01:58:06.913,"Well, our boy's grown up, gone off to school."
01:58:06.996,01:58:09.082,"Harry's girls, they're all married now."
01:58:09.957,01:58:11.042,Brutal's a single man.
01:58:11.125,01:58:14.337,"You're the only one here with two children, another one on the way."
01:58:15.171,01:58:18.091,Let's not discuss this as if we're thinking of doing it.
01:58:20.510,01:58:22.762,"Brutal, help me out here."
01:58:24.514,01:58:27.683,-I'm sure she's a fine woman. -The finest.
01:58:28.101,01:58:30.603,"What is happening to her is an offense, Brutal."
01:58:30.686,01:58:33.147,To the eye and the ear and to the heart.
01:58:33.231,01:58:34.857,I have no doubt.
01:58:36.400,01:58:38.486,"But we don't know her like you and Jan do, do we?"
01:58:38.820,01:58:41.572,"And let's not forget, John Coffey is a murderer."
01:58:43.074,01:58:44.659,"Now, what if he escapes?"
01:58:45.201,01:58:52.041,"I'd hate to lose my job or go to prison, but I'd hate worse to have a dead child on my conscience."
01:58:52.125,01:58:53.417,I don't think that's gonna happen.
01:58:55.795,01:59:01.259,"In fact, I don't think he did it at all."
01:59:04.720,01:59:10.601,I do not see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who'd kill a child.
01:59:11.102,01:59:14.772,"Well, that's a very tender notion, but the man is on death row for the crime."
01:59:17.275,01:59:20.403,"And plus, he's huge."
01:59:20.903,01:59:25.616,"If he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him."
01:59:26.033,01:59:29.495,"Oh, we'd all have shotguns, in addition to side arms."
01:59:30.538,01:59:31.747,I'd insist on that.
01:59:33.082,01:59:37.920,"If he tried anything, anything at all, we'd have to take him down."
01:59:39.005,01:59:40.006,You understand?
01:59:51.934,01:59:55.188,"So, tell us what you had in mind."
02:00:16.417,02:00:18.085,You think this is enough?
02:00:19.587,02:00:21.047,I don't know.
02:00:57.875,02:00:59.752,You fellas thirsty?
02:00:59.835,02:01:01.504,Fresh out of the icebox.
02:01:01.587,02:01:03.923,"You bet. That's swell, Brutal. Thanks."
02:01:07.802,02:01:10.680,"Hey, hey. I'm gonna get some, too, ain't I?"
02:01:11.180,02:01:12.848,"My ass, you get some, too."
02:01:12.932,02:01:14.517,What makes you think you deserve any?
02:01:15.351,02:01:17.144,Because I got a big pecker.
02:01:17.728,02:01:20.106,"Well, the day report says he's been okay."
02:01:23.943,02:01:25.278,Don't be stingy hogs.
02:01:30.491,02:01:32.702,"Come on. Come on now, fellers."
02:01:34.245,02:01:35.538,"Come on, boss."
02:01:35.871,02:01:37.665,I been good all day.
02:01:40.793,02:01:42.211,It's hot in here.
02:01:42.753,02:01:45.881,"It's hot in this cell, and I'm dogged to drink. I'm thirsty."
02:01:46.382,02:01:48.175,Why don't you give me some?
02:01:55.057,02:01:56.267,Come on.
02:02:01.564,02:02:02.732,You gonna stay behaved?
02:02:03.607,02:02:05.192,"Come on, you clunk, give me that."
02:02:05.443,02:02:09.405,"You promise me, or else I'll drink this myself right here in front of you."
02:02:09.822,02:02:12.283,"Don't, don't, don't... Come on, now. Don't be that way."
02:02:13.075,02:02:14.201,I'll be good.
02:02:39.393,02:02:40.436,Cup.
02:03:31.320,02:03:33.406,"Anybody wants out, now's the time."
02:03:34.490,02:03:35.991,"After this, there's no turning back."
02:03:37.827,02:03:38.828,So?
02:03:39.995,02:03:41.497,We gonna do this?
02:03:44.834,02:03:46.460,I'd like to take a ride.
02:03:52.216,02:03:53.717,Guess we're all in.
02:04:05.521,02:04:06.647,What is this?
02:04:09.066,02:04:10.151,Payback.
02:04:16.532,02:04:17.950,"No, you let me go!"
02:04:18.033,02:04:19.452,-Let go of me! -Settle down.
02:04:19.535,02:04:20.703,-Let go! -Settle down.
02:04:20.786,02:04:22.496,-What are you doing? -Settle down.
02:04:29.545,02:04:30.754,Oh!
02:04:34.258,02:04:35.426,What would your mother say?
02:04:35.509,02:04:37.636,"You let go of me, you ignoramus."
02:04:37.720,02:04:40.556,I know people. Big people!
02:04:40.973,02:04:43.726,"Percy, stick out your arms like a good lad."
02:04:44.101,02:04:46.479,"No, I won't do it. You can't make me."
02:04:46.562,02:04:48.314,"Oh, you're dead wrong about that, you know."
02:04:54.737,02:04:57.072,"You gonna put your arms up, huh?"
02:04:57.865,02:05:01.035,"A big man is ripping your ears off, Percy. I'd do as he says."
02:05:03.162,02:05:04.413,There you go.
02:05:13.130,02:05:14.298,"Please, Paul."
02:05:14.798,02:05:16.926,Please don't put me in with Wild Bill.
02:05:17.009,02:05:18.469,Please don't.
02:05:19.678,02:05:21.013,You would think that.
02:05:23.474,02:05:25.935,"No, no, no, you can't do this to me."
02:05:26.018,02:05:28.521,You can't do this to me. You can't.
02:05:29.063,02:05:31.106,"I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Percy."
02:05:31.190,02:05:33.359,We can and we are.
02:05:40.950,02:05:45.871,"We'll give you a few hours of quiet time, Percy, so you can reflect on what you did to Del."
02:05:45.955,02:05:49.041,"And if you get lonely, just think about Miss Leadpipe."
02:05:58.551,02:06:00.803,"All right, let's go over it one more time."
02:06:00.886,02:06:02.596,What do you say if somebody stops by?
02:06:04.848,02:06:09.436,"Coffey got upset just after lights out, so we put the coat on him, locked him in the restraint room."
02:06:10.312,02:06:12.273,"They hear any kicking and fussing, they'll think it's him."
02:06:12.356,02:06:13.440,What about me?
02:06:13.524,02:06:18.821,"You're down in Admin pulling Del's file, going over the witnesses on account of how big a screw-up the execution was."
02:06:21.824,02:06:23.409,We going for the ride now?
02:06:23.826,02:06:25.661,That's right. We going for the ride.
02:06:28.455,02:06:30.124,"What about us, Dean?"
02:06:30.207,02:06:34.086,"You, Harry, Percy, all down in the laundry doing your wash."
02:06:34.169,02:06:35.921,Probably take y'all a few hours before you're back.
02:06:40.342,02:06:41.719,Where you think you going?
02:06:48.767,02:06:50.269,You a bad man.
02:06:50.644,02:06:52.855,"That's right, nigger. Bad as you'd want."
02:07:00.654,02:07:03.824,What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong?
02:07:28.223,02:07:30.726,Whole room... Whole room's spinning.
02:07:31.685,02:07:33.479,It's like I'm shitty-ass drunk.
02:07:34.063,02:07:35.939,Had me some shine or...
02:07:37.191,02:07:38.400,Or what?
02:07:40.903,02:07:43.656,Niggers ought to have their own electric chair.
02:07:43.739,02:07:48.118,White man ought not to have to sit in no nigger electric chair.
02:07:48.952,02:07:50.204,"No, sir."
02:07:57.378,02:07:59.463,He a bad man.
02:08:19.650,02:08:20.776,"Look, boss."
02:08:25.280,02:08:27.950,"It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair."
02:08:53.392,02:08:54.685,Now!
02:09:30.679,02:09:32.806,"All right, big boy. Let's get moving. Come on."
02:10:16.934,02:10:20.187,"John, do you know where we're taking you tonight?"
02:10:23.941,02:10:25.108,Help a lady?
02:10:29.738,02:10:30.781,But how do you know?
02:10:32.574,02:10:33.951,Don't know.
02:10:35.911,02:10:39.623,"Tell the truth, boss, I don't know much of anything."
02:10:41.708,02:10:42.960,I never have.
02:11:18.287,02:11:19.830,We can still turn back.
02:11:22.124,02:11:24.793,"Boss, look. Someone's up."
02:11:26.962,02:11:28.338,This was a mistake.
02:11:29.256,02:11:31.341,"Oh, Christ, Paul, what were we thinking?"
02:11:31.425,02:11:33.844,"It's too late now. John, you stay."
02:11:38.891,02:11:41.476,"Harry, you keep John here till we call you."
02:11:52.112,02:11:54.740,Who the hell goes there at 2:30 in the goddamn morning?
02:11:57.409,02:11:58.994,-It's us. -Jesus.
02:11:59.077,02:12:01.580,"It isn't a lockdown, is it? Or a riot?"
02:12:07.502,02:12:09.212,Who's out there?
02:12:09.296,02:12:11.381,"-Who's by that truck? -Harry, the lights!"
02:12:15.677,02:12:17.095,John Coffey.
02:12:29.024,02:12:30.150,-Halt! -Hal.
02:12:33.528,02:12:34.571,Hal!
02:12:34.905,02:12:37.157,Who you talking to down there?
02:12:37.699,02:12:39.034,God damn it!
02:12:39.117,02:12:41.119,"Hal, now, nobody is hurt."
02:12:42.245,02:12:43.455,And we are here to help.
02:12:43.538,02:12:44.873,Help what?
02:12:45.624,02:12:46.833,I don't understand.
02:13:06.478,02:13:07.604,What do you want?
02:13:10.607,02:13:12.609,Make them go away!
02:13:13.610,02:13:19.116,I don't want no salesmen in the middle of the night.
02:13:19.908,02:13:23.912,Tell them to take a flying fuck at a rolling...
02:13:25.872,02:13:28.250,"Just to help, boss. That's all."
02:13:29.418,02:13:30.752,You can't.
02:13:31.420,02:13:32.587,No one can.
02:13:54.568,02:13:56.945,You stop now. You hear me?
02:13:57.696,02:13:59.364,"Paul, I don't want him up there."
02:13:59.448,02:14:02.242,"Boss, you just be quiet now."
02:14:50.832,02:14:53.251,"It's all right, Hal. It's all right."
02:15:02.010,02:15:04.554,"Don't come near me, pig fucker."
02:15:18.527,02:15:21.404,Why do you have so many scars?
02:15:23.698,02:15:26.409,"Who hurt you so badly, huh?"
02:15:27.536,02:15:29.704,"Don't hardly remember, ma'am."
02:15:32.415,02:15:34.376,"What's your name, huh?"
02:15:34.459,02:15:37.295,"John Coffey, ma'am. Like the drink."
02:15:38.171,02:15:40.132,Only not spelt the same.
02:15:47.180,02:15:48.348,Ma'am?
02:15:59.860,02:16:01.111,I see it.
02:16:10.579,02:16:12.831,What's happening?
02:16:13.999,02:16:19.087,"Shh, you be still now. You be so quiet and so still."
02:17:45.507,02:17:47.842,"Come on, John. Sick it up."
02:17:51.972,02:17:55.600,"He's choking. Whatever he sucked out of her, he's choking on it."
02:17:56.309,02:17:57.394,John.
02:17:59.062,02:18:01.606,I'll be fine. Just let me be.
02:18:19.291,02:18:24.045,We... We were going to the hospital in Vicksburg.
02:18:28.800,02:18:33.096,It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore.
02:18:33.179,02:18:34.973,Did I have the X-ray?
02:18:36.266,02:18:37.434,Did I?
02:18:42.689,02:18:45.442,Yes. It was clear.
02:18:45.525,02:18:46.776,There was no tumor.
02:18:51.614,02:18:52.657,Oh.
02:19:02.751,02:19:07.380,"John, can you stand up? Can you turn around and see this lady?"
02:19:20.435,02:19:22.062,What's your name?
02:19:23.438,02:19:25.148,"John Coffey, ma'am."
02:19:26.858,02:19:28.401,Like the drink.
02:19:30.028,02:19:31.988,Only not spelt the same.
02:19:32.530,02:19:35.784,"No, ma'am, not spelt the same at all."
02:19:39.204,02:19:41.956,"Melly. No, you can't."
02:20:07.148,02:20:08.817,I dreamed of you.
02:20:12.070,02:20:14.864,I dreamed you were wandering in the dark.
02:20:16.324,02:20:17.826,And so was I.
02:20:20.036,02:20:22.163,And we found each other.
02:20:23.331,02:20:25.834,We found each other in the dark.
02:20:45.437,02:20:47.021,"Take it, John. It's a present."
02:20:47.605,02:20:49.399,It's St. Christopher.
02:20:50.859,02:20:52.986,"I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey."
02:20:54.028,02:20:56.072,And wear it. He'll keep you safe.
02:20:56.865,02:21:00.034,Please. Wear it for me.
02:21:18.803,02:21:20.388,"Thank you, John."
02:21:27.645,02:21:31.900,"Christ, he goes down, it'll take three mules and a crane to pick him up again."
02:21:32.358,02:21:35.653,"Take it easy, John. Come on, now. You gotta stay on your feet."
02:21:51.753,02:21:54.422,"He'll never sit in Old Sparky. You know that, don't you?"
02:21:55.381,02:21:57.592,He swallowed that stuff for a reason.
02:21:58.259,02:22:00.678,I give him a few days.
02:22:00.762,02:22:04.516,"One of us will be doing a cell check, and there he'll be, dead on his bunk."
02:22:04.599,02:22:07.185,"Well, if that's his choice, he's earned it."
02:22:07.268,02:22:09.145,Let's just get him back on the Mile.
02:22:23.326,02:22:25.203,"Oh, boy, am I happy to see you fellows."
02:22:25.286,02:22:28.414,"You were gone so long, Wild Bill's making noise like he's gonna wake up."
02:22:28.498,02:22:29.499,What the hell happened to him?
02:22:29.832,02:22:32.460,"He's hurting, Dean. He's hurting bad."
02:22:36.381,02:22:38.299,"Okay, John."
02:22:38.383,02:22:41.844,We gonna set you down on your bed now.
02:22:41.928,02:22:43.263,Here we go.
02:23:01.406,02:23:02.490,Well?
02:23:04.534,02:23:06.452,What about Mrs. Moores?
02:23:08.580,02:23:10.456,Was it like the mouse?
02:23:11.666,02:23:17.338,"Was it, you know, a miracle?"
02:23:17.922,02:23:19.132,Yes.
02:23:20.466,02:23:22.218,"Yes, it was."
02:23:23.261,02:23:24.429,Damn.
02:23:40.069,02:23:44.782,"Now, I want to talk, not shout."
02:23:44.866,02:23:47.577,"I take that tape off, you gonna be calm?"
02:23:47.660,02:23:48.870,Mmm-hmm.
02:23:50.580,02:23:53.374,"My mother always says you do it fast, it won't hurt so much."
02:23:57.211,02:23:58.963,Guess she was wrong.
02:24:02.383,02:24:03.801,Let me out of this nut-coat.
02:24:03.885,02:24:06.179,-In a minute. -Now! Right now!
02:24:11.768,02:24:13.519,Shut up and listen.
02:24:14.729,02:24:17.106,Now you deserved to be punished for what you did to Del.
02:24:17.190,02:24:18.358,You accept it like a man.
02:24:19.233,02:24:21.319,Or else we'll make you sorry you were ever born.
02:24:22.195,02:24:25.323,We'll tell people how you sabotaged Del's execution...
02:24:25.406,02:24:26.741,Sabotaged?
02:24:26.824,02:24:28.743,How you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl.
02:24:28.826,02:24:31.037,"Ooh, yes. Yeah, we will talk."
02:24:32.288,02:24:35.917,"But, Percy, you mind me, now."
02:24:36.918,02:24:40.380,We'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life.
02:24:42.423,02:24:43.675,"We know people, too."
02:24:45.259,02:24:47.428,"Are you so foolish, you don't realize that?"
02:24:49.972,02:24:52.767,"Let bygones be bygones, hmm?"
02:24:54.143,02:24:57.063,Nothing's hurt so far but your pride.
02:24:57.146,02:25:01.234,"No one ever need know about that, except the people in this little room."
02:25:01.776,02:25:04.654,What happens on the Mile stays on the Mile.
02:25:06.239,02:25:07.615,Always has.
02:25:12.120,02:25:13.496,Hmm.
02:25:16.916,02:25:19.335,May I be let out of this coat now?
02:25:39.272,02:25:40.356,My things?
02:25:43.609,02:25:45.403,"Think it over, Percy."
02:25:46.487,02:25:48.114,"Oh, I intend to."
02:25:49.282,02:25:52.160,I intend to think it over very hard.
02:25:53.911,02:25:55.663,Starting right now.
02:26:05.548,02:26:08.676,He'll talk. Sooner or later.
02:26:09.177,02:26:10.261,Hmm.
02:26:23.316,02:26:25.651,"-Hey, let him go! -John, let go!"
02:26:25.735,02:26:28.571,"-Let go, John! -John, God damn it! Let him go!"
02:26:28.654,02:26:29.781,"Let go, John! No!"
02:26:33.743,02:26:36.287,"John, stop it! Stop it, John!"
02:26:36.370,02:26:38.456,"-Let him go! Back off! -John, let him go!"
02:27:39.267,02:27:41.811,"Easy, now. Easy."
02:27:43.604,02:27:44.939,Easy. Hey.
02:27:46.107,02:27:47.149,Hey.
02:27:51.237,02:27:52.405,Percy.
02:27:55.533,02:27:57.201,Are you all right?
02:28:29.817,02:28:31.485,"Boy, what you looking at?"
02:28:39.619,02:28:43.247,What you looking at? You limp noodle.
02:28:43.789,02:28:45.625,You wanna kiss my ass?
02:28:46.459,02:28:47.877,You wanna suck my dick?
02:29:09.106,02:29:11.150,"Grab the gun! Dean, grab the gun!"
02:29:19.659,02:29:21.327,"No, no, no."
02:30:14.005,02:30:16.215,I punished them bad men.
02:30:17.008,02:30:18.676,I punished them both.
02:30:19.051,02:30:20.261,Why?
02:30:21.220,02:30:22.346,Why Wild Bill?
02:30:23.764,02:30:27.309,I saw in his heart when he grabbed my arm.
02:30:28.936,02:30:30.730,I saw what Wild Billy done.
02:30:31.605,02:30:33.399,Saw it plain as day.
02:30:34.942,02:30:37.486,You can't hide what's in your heart.
02:30:38.029,02:30:39.196,What?
02:30:40.906,02:30:42.241,You saw what?
02:30:46.245,02:30:47.997,"Take my hand, boss."
02:30:51.459,02:30:52.918,You see for yourself.
02:30:55.046,02:30:57.590,"Paul, no."
02:31:02.094,02:31:03.304,Please.
02:31:11.812,02:31:13.814,"No, no, no."
02:31:14.774,02:31:17.526,"-Please. -I gots to, boss."
02:31:17.610,02:31:20.112,I gots to give you a little bit of myself.
02:31:24.617,02:31:28.621,A gift of what's inside of me so you can see for yourself.
02:31:50.518,02:31:53.104,Hot cross buns with warm milk.
02:32:26.554,02:32:29.682,Suppertime! Bring the girls.
02:32:33.853,02:32:36.272,Girls! You heard your mama!
02:32:58.711,02:33:01.839,"Come on, Billy. I worked you enough for one day."
02:33:02.631,02:33:04.633,Come get you some supper.
02:33:37.917,02:33:40.127,"You make any noise, you know what happens?"
02:33:40.753,02:33:43.172,I'm gonna kill her instead of you.
02:33:43.255,02:33:46.717,"You make any noise, I'm gonna kill her. You understand?"
02:33:46.800,02:33:48.344,You understand?
02:33:48.928,02:33:50.429,Shh!
02:34:06.987,02:34:10.866,"He killed them with they love, they love for each other."
02:34:12.409,02:34:14.286,Now you see how it is.
02:34:15.913,02:34:18.207,That's the way it is every day.
02:34:19.124,02:34:22.836,That's the way it is all over the world.
02:34:41.021,02:34:42.106,Son?
02:34:42.815,02:34:44.441,"Son, can you hear me?"
02:34:44.525,02:34:45.818,Speak up if you can hear us.
02:34:46.819,02:34:49.613,I think this boy's cheese slid off his cracker.
02:35:00.791,02:35:02.793,"Scared the boy so bad, he wet hisself."
02:35:04.461,02:35:07.214,"See, we didn't even... We didn't see it happen."
02:35:11.385,02:35:16.515,"I'll cover for you as much as I can, even if it means my job."
02:35:17.766,02:35:22.938,"But I have to know, does this have anything to do with what happened at my house?"
02:35:26.191,02:35:27.693,"Does it, Paul?"
02:35:29.695,02:35:30.738,No.
02:36:58.367,02:37:01.703,"Does Hal know? That Coffey's innocent, I mean."
02:37:03.455,02:37:05.124,"Well, can he help?"
02:37:05.666,02:37:08.293,Does he have the influence to do something about this?
02:37:08.836,02:37:10.254,Stop the execution?
02:37:10.337,02:37:11.380,No.
02:37:14.675,02:37:16.635,Then don't tell him.
02:37:16.718,02:37:18.804,"If it can't help, don't tell him."
02:37:19.471,02:37:20.556,Ever.
02:37:22.933,02:37:24.476,I won't.
02:37:36.113,02:37:38.490,"There's no way out of this for you, is there?"
02:37:40.284,02:37:41.326,No.
02:37:42.411,02:37:44.997,"And I've been thinking about it, believe me."
02:37:45.080,02:37:48.292,I've been running it through my head any number of ways.
02:37:48.834,02:37:49.835,No.
02:37:51.128,02:37:52.838,"I'll tell you the truth, honey."
02:37:54.715,02:38:04.266,"I've done some things in my life that I am not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt real danger of hell."
02:38:06.185,02:38:07.269,Hell?
02:38:13.192,02:38:14.568,Talk to him.
02:38:16.028,02:38:17.488,Talk to John.
02:38:19.656,02:38:21.533,Find out what he wants.
02:38:38.550,02:38:39.635,"Hello, boss."
02:38:40.594,02:38:42.012,"Hello, John."
02:38:43.388,02:38:45.682,I guess you know we're coming down to it now.
02:38:46.642,02:38:48.227,Another couple of days.
02:39:01.782,02:39:04.326,Is there anything special you wanna eat for dinner that night?
02:39:05.285,02:39:07.162,We can rustle you up most anything.
02:39:17.631,02:39:19.633,Meat loaf be nice.
02:39:19.716,02:39:23.595,"Mashed taters, gravy. Okra."
02:39:25.264,02:39:28.016,Maybe some of that fine corn bread your missus make.
02:39:28.850,02:39:30.769,If she don't mind.
02:39:33.146,02:39:34.481,"Now, uh..."
02:39:35.190,02:39:39.528,What about a preacher? Someone to say a little prayer with.
02:39:40.237,02:39:42.114,Don't want no preacher.
02:39:43.532,02:39:45.951,"You can say a prayer, if you like."
02:39:46.785,02:39:48.120,Me?
02:39:50.872,02:39:53.417,"Suppose I could, if it came to that."
02:39:57.671,02:40:04.469,"John, I have to ask you something very important now."
02:40:06.346,02:40:08.390,I know what you gonna say.
02:40:09.016,02:40:10.392,You don't have to say it.
02:40:10.851,02:40:13.604,"No, I do. I do. I have to say it."
02:40:15.105,02:40:20.360,"John, tell me what you want me to do."
02:40:21.445,02:40:23.280,You want me to take you out of here?
02:40:24.615,02:40:26.658,Just let you run away?
02:40:26.742,02:40:28.452,See how far you could get?
02:40:30.203,02:40:32.497,Why would you do such a foolish thing?
02:40:34.916,02:40:43.425,"On the day of my judgment, when I stand before God and he asks me why did I..."
02:40:44.301,02:40:52.184,"Did I kill one of his true miracles, what am I going to say?"
02:40:53.393,02:40:55.145,That it was my job?
02:40:57.606,02:40:59.024,It's my job.
02:40:59.691,02:41:03.695,You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done.
02:41:07.532,02:41:09.701,I know you're hurting and worrying.
02:41:10.702,02:41:14.122,I can feel it on you. But you ought to quit on it now.
02:41:15.457,02:41:17.959,I want it to be over and done with.
02:41:19.211,02:41:20.337,I do.
02:41:25.258,02:41:26.885,"I'm tired, boss."
02:41:28.387,02:41:32.391,"I'm tired of being on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain."
02:41:34.142,02:41:41.441,"I'm tired of never having me a buddy to be with, to tell me where we's going to, coming from, or why."
02:41:42.984,02:41:46.697,"Mostly, I'm tired of people being ugly to each other."
02:41:48.115,02:41:53.912,"I'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world, every day."
02:41:54.413,02:41:56.331,There's too much of it.
02:41:56.873,02:42:02.254,"It's like pieces of glass in my head, all the time."
02:42:04.798,02:42:06.550,Can you understand?
02:42:09.553,02:42:12.180,"Yes, John, I think I can."
02:42:20.605,02:42:22.441,There must be something that you want.
02:42:32.200,02:42:35.746,I ain't never seen me a flicker show.
02:42:39.541,02:44:04.459,"I'm in heaven And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak And I seem to find the happiness I seek When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek Why, they's angels."
02:44:05.752,02:44:08.380,"Angels, just like up in heaven."
02:45:09.107,02:45:11.067,"It be all right, fellas."
02:45:12.527,02:45:14.571,This here's the hard part.
02:45:16.072,02:45:17.532,I'll be all right in a little while.
02:45:18.533,02:45:22.787,"John, I should have this just for now."
02:45:27.292,02:45:29.294,I'll give it back after.
02:45:32.631,02:45:36.885,"You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream."
02:45:38.720,02:45:40.513,I dreamed about Del's mouse.
02:45:41.973,02:45:43.016,"Did you, John?"
02:45:43.683,02:45:48.396,I dreamed Mr. Jingles got down to that place Boss Howell talked about.
02:45:48.480,02:45:50.315,That Mouseville place.
02:45:59.699,02:46:03.161,I dreamed that those two little blond-headed girls was there.
02:46:03.870,02:46:05.914,"They's laughing, too."
02:46:05.997,02:46:09.250,I put my arms around them and set 'em on my knees.
02:46:09.334,02:46:13.421,"And there's no blood coming out of they hair, and they's just fine."
02:46:13.505,02:46:16.675,We all watched Mr. Jingles roll that spool.
02:46:18.176,02:46:19.427,How we did laugh.
02:46:19.511,02:46:21.304,"Fit to bust, we was!"
02:46:37.445,02:46:38.530,John.
02:46:45.745,02:46:47.247,I can feel it.
02:46:47.998,02:46:49.874,It's like bees stinging me.
02:46:50.291,02:46:52.502,"Well, feel how we feel, then."
02:46:54.004,02:46:55.046,We don't hate you.
02:46:56.631,02:46:58.049,Can you feel that?
02:47:03.263,02:47:07.434,You go on and kill that raping baby killer twice!
02:47:07.517,02:47:09.060,That'd be fine!
02:47:25.869,02:47:28.329,"Wipe your face before you stand up, Dean."
02:47:28.747,02:47:29.998,"Yes, sir."
02:47:42.093,02:47:43.261,Roll on one.
02:47:55.648,02:47:57.692,I hope it hurts like hell.
02:47:59.944,02:48:07.827,"John Coffey, you've been condemned to die in the electric chair by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state."
02:48:07.911,02:48:10.663,Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
02:48:12.957,02:48:14.918,I'm sorry for what I am.
02:48:27.514,02:48:32.977,"Please, boss, don't put that thing over my face."
02:48:34.479,02:48:36.481,Don't put me in the dark.
02:49:14.686,02:49:53.474,"Heaven, heaven I'm in heaven Heaven, heaven I'm in heaven Heaven Heaven, I'm in heaven I'm in heaven I'm in heaven I'm in heaven Heaven Heaven Heaven John Coffey, electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead in accordance with state law."
02:49:56.144,02:49:59.397,May God have mercy on your soul.
02:50:38.603,02:50:40.313,You have to say it.
02:50:42.190,02:50:44.275,You have to give the order.
02:51:04.963,02:51:09.008,That's how it is every day all over the world.
02:53:13.257,02:53:15.885,I just couldn't do it anymore after that.
02:53:15.968,02:53:21.933,"Brutal either. We both transferred out, took jobs with Boys' Correctional."
02:53:23.101,02:53:24.769,It was all right.
02:53:25.603,02:53:28.106,Catch them young became my motto.
02:53:31.651,02:53:32.944,You don't believe me.
02:53:33.778,02:53:36.406,"I don't imagine you'd lie to me, Paul."
02:53:37.031,02:53:39.409,-It's just that-- -It's quite a story.
02:53:39.492,02:53:41.244,It's quite a story.
02:53:42.120,02:53:44.539,One thing I don't understand.
02:53:44.622,02:53:49.836,You said you and Jan had a grown son in 1935.
02:53:50.461,02:53:51.963,Is that right?
02:53:52.422,02:53:54.382,"The math doesn't work, does it?"
02:54:00.012,02:54:02.348,Do you feel up to taking a walk?
02:54:25.288,02:54:27.290,Now let your eyes adjust.
02:54:39.427,02:54:40.595,There.
02:54:43.097,02:54:46.934,"Hey. Wake up, old fella. Wake up."
02:54:50.938,02:54:54.692,"Paul, it isn't. It can't be."
02:54:59.197,02:55:00.615,"Come over here, boy."
02:55:01.199,02:55:03.409,Come on over here and see this lady.
02:55:06.412,02:55:09.081,That can't be Mr. Jingles.
02:55:32.063,02:55:33.981,"Go on, you can do it."
02:55:41.656,02:55:45.535,"This isn't exactly the Mouseville we had in mind, is it?"
02:55:46.953,02:55:50.248,"But we make do. Don't we, old fella?"
02:55:57.380,02:56:00.258,I think Mr. Jingles happened by accident.
02:56:01.551,02:56:08.766,"I think when we electrocuted Del, and it all went so badly, well, John could feel that, you know."
02:56:09.267,02:56:18.359,And I think a part of whatever magic was inside of him just leapt into my tiny friend here.
02:56:20.236,02:56:31.622,"As for me, John had to give me a part of himself, a gift, the way he saw it, so that I could see for myself what Wild Bill had done."
02:56:34.542,02:56:47.972,"When John did that, when he took my hand, a part of the power that worked through him spilled into me."
02:56:48.806,02:56:50.016,He what?
02:56:50.891,02:56:54.478,He infected you with life?
02:56:56.022,02:56:58.149,It's as good a word as any.
02:56:59.817,02:57:03.904,"He infected us both, didn't he, Mr. Jingles? With life."
02:57:08.618,02:57:10.995,"I'm 108 years old, Elaine."
02:57:11.829,02:57:15.416,I was 44 the year that John Coffey walked the Green Mile.
02:57:19.086,02:57:21.005,You mustn't blame John.
02:57:21.505,02:57:26.135,He couldn't help what happened. He was... He's just a force of nature.
02:57:27.970,02:57:31.766,"Oh, I've lived to see some amazing things, Ellie."
02:57:33.351,02:57:35.561,Another century come to pass.
02:57:36.562,02:57:37.938,But I've...
02:57:39.148,02:57:43.319,I've had to see my friends and loved ones die off through the years.
02:57:44.028,02:57:50.284,"Hal and Melinda, Brutus Howell, my wife, my boy."
02:57:53.704,02:57:55.331,"And you, Elaine."
02:57:56.666,02:57:58.250,"You'll die, too."
02:57:59.835,02:58:03.547,And my curse is knowing that I'll be there to see it.
02:58:05.716,02:58:07.843,"It's my atonement, you see."
02:58:08.719,02:58:17.269,"It's my punishment for letting John Coffey ride the lightning, for killing a miracle of God."
02:58:22.525,02:58:24.485,the source of all being and life...
02:58:31.492,02:58:34.954,"Oh, I'll die eventually. Of that I'm sure."
02:58:36.205,02:58:39.333,I have no illusions of immortality.
02:58:40.459,02:58:45.589,But I will have wished for death long before death finds me.
02:58:47.216,02:58:50.177,"In truth, I wish for it already."
02:59:03.107,02:59:04.483,Mr. Jingles?
02:59:14.118,02:59:15.870,"Where you been, hmm?"
02:59:16.579,02:59:20.708,"Been worried about you, boy. You hungry, hmm?"
02:59:20.791,02:59:23.043,Let's go see if we can't find you something to eat.
02:59:24.378,02:59:26.130,A few crumbs anyway.
02:59:26.213,02:59:28.132,I know you'd like that.
02:59:29.425,02:59:31.427,Look at you. Mr. Jingles.
02:59:32.470,02:59:35.723,I lie in bed most nights thinking about it.
02:59:36.557,02:59:37.933,And I wait.
02:59:39.185,02:59:43.856,"I think about all the people I've loved, now long gone."
02:59:45.316,02:59:50.321,"I think about my beautiful Jan, how I lost her so many years ago."
02:59:52.156,02:59:59.163,"And I think about all of us walking our own Green Mile, each in our own time."
03:00:00.956,03:00:06.253,But one thought more than any other keeps me awake most nights.
03:00:08.005,03:00:14.553,"If he could make a mouse live so long, how much longer do I have?"
03:00:19.016,03:00:21.393,We each owe a death.
03:00:22.061,03:00:24.021,There are no exceptions.
03:00:25.189,03:00:33.364,"But, oh, God, sometimes, the Green Mile seems so long."
