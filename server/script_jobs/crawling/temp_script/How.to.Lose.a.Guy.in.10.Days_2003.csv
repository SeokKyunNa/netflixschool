00:14:11.726,00:14:14.813,"YES, SIR, AND THAT'S ME."
00:14:14.853,00:14:22.236,"BEN, YOU SELL JOE BLOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN MY SHOP, BUT THESE GIRLS SELL LUXURY BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE BUSINESS."
00:14:22.278,00:14:26.282,WE HAVE TO PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD ON THIS PITCH. DE LAUER WOULD BE OUR BIGGEST ACCOUNT.
00:14:26.324,00:14:30.870,"YES, SIR, THEY WOULD."
00:14:30.911,00:14:33.707,"AND I AM THE MAN THAT'S GONNA BRING THIS HOME FOR YOU, PHIL."
00:14:33.748,00:14:37.502,WHY THIS PLACE?
00:14:37.544,00:14:42.882,MULLIN'S IS THE APRES-WORK WATERING HOLE FOR THE UPWARDLY MOBILE.
00:14:42.923,00:14:49.681,"NOW, TO DATE, THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY HAS ALWAYS TARGETED MEN, SENDING THE MESSAGE THAT THE WOMAN NEEDS THE MAN TO BUY HER THE ROCK."
00:14:49.723,00:14:54.686,THEY SAY A DIAMOND IS FOREVER.
00:14:54.728,00:14:56.563,I LIKE THAT.
00:14:56.604,00:14:59.524,WE DON'T.
00:14:59.566,00:15:02.610,SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT DIAMONDS ARE EVERYWHERE.
00:15:02.652,00:15:07.407,"WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT RARE, AND IF THEY'RE NOT RARE, THEY LOSE THEIR STATUS."
00:15:07.448,00:15:14.288,"STATUS IS THE REASON TO BUY THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE, WHICH BENJAMIN WOULD KNOW IF HE UNDERSTOOD WOMEN, WHICH YOU DON'T."
00:15:16.583,00:15:20.002,"YOU CAN'T FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT, BEN."
00:15:20.044,00:15:22.296,HERE YOU GO.

00:15:33.474,00:15:36.936,"YES, EXACTLY."
00:15:36.977,00:15:41.315,SELLING A DIAMOND TO A WOMAN IS LIKE MAKING HER FALL IN LOVE.
00:15:41.357,00:15:46.279,"SHE HAS TO FEEL GIDDY, DESIROUS, ADVENTUROUS AND DESPERATE."
00:15:46.320,00:15:51.701,"TAKE A LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM, PHILLIP. MOST OF THE WOMEN IN THIS BAR ARE LOOKING FOR THAT."
00:15:51.743,00:15:53.787,EXACTLY. THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO MARKET DIAMONDS...
00:15:53.828,00:15:57.081,"ARE THE SAME AS THOSE NEEDED TO MAKE A WOMAN FALL IN LOVE, YES."
00:15:57.123,00:16:01.377,I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LUST.
00:16:01.419,00:16:03.671,A WOMAN IN LOVE WANTS DIAMONDS.
00:16:03.713,00:16:07.216,"YEAH, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT LUST EITHER, LADIES."
00:16:07.258,00:16:15.642,"I'M TALKING ABOUT DEEP, MEANINGFUL, HEAD-OVER-HEELS, HIS-AND-HER TOWELS, LET'S GROW OLD TOGETHER L-O-V-E."
00:16:15.683,00:16:19.562,"LOOK, I LOVE WOMEN."
00:16:19.604,00:16:26.110,"WHETHER THEY'RE FOUR OR 40 OR MY 88-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER, I RESPECT WOMEN."
00:16:26.152,00:16:29.781,AND I ALSO LISTEN TO WOMEN.
00:16:29.823,00:16:33.827,"AND THAT'S WHY I CAN SELL MYSELF TO ANY WOMAN, ANYWHERE, ANYTIME."
00:16:33.868,00:16:39.248,"MAKE A WOMAN FALL IN LOVE WITH DIAMONDS, BENJAMIN, OR WITH YOU?"
00:16:39.290,00:16:40.959,"UH, EITHER ONE."
00:16:41.000,00:16:45.463,"- THAT'S COCKY, BEN."
00:16:46.756,00:16:49.175,- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU PROVE THAT.

00:17:08.319,00:17:14.450,"I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU, BEN. IN FACT, WE'LL CHOOSE A WOMAN RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW IN THIS BAR."
00:17:14.492,00:17:17.370,AND THEN YOU DECIDE.
00:17:18.162,00:17:19.873,SO WHO'S THE LUCKY GIRL?
00:17:19.914,00:17:23.543,OKAY.
