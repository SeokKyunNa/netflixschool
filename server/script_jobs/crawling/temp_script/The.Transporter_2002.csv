00:03:26.540,00:03:29.625,Move it! Move it! Move it! Let’s go!
00:03:33.505,00:03:36.049,Let’s go.
00:03:36.133,00:03:39.052,- Let’s go. - There’s four of you.
00:03:39.136,00:03:40.928,You can count. I’m impressed. Now drive.
00:03:41.012,00:03:42.889,Rule one: Never change the deal.
00:03:42.973,00:03:46.726,The deal was transportation for three men with a combined weight of 254 kilos.
00:03:46.810,00:03:49.645,"Yeah? Well, this is a new deal."
00:03:49.729,00:03:53.816,An extra 80 kilos means we’ll not make your destination on the gas I have allotted.
00:03:53.900,00:03:56.778,- So we’ll stop and get more gas. - Every stop we make exposes us.
00:03:56.862,00:03:59.572,Every exposure increases the risk of getting caught.
00:03:59.656,00:04:03.117,An extra 80 kilos means the KONI shock absorbers I installed for this job...
00:04:03.201,00:04:07.246,will not give us the ability to outmaneuver any police that might be chasing us.
00:04:07.330,00:04:11.167,"Which means, if there is a chase, we lose our advantage."
00:04:11.251,00:04:13.753,Which also increases the possibility of getting caught.
00:04:13.837,00:04:17.423,I don’t want to get caught. You don’t want to get caught.
00:04:17.507,00:04:20.259,"Just drive the car, or you’re gonna catch a bullet through the brains."
00:04:20.343,00:04:23.012,- And who’s going to drive? - Shoot this asshole! I drive!
00:04:23.096,00:04:25.182,Not without the ignition code you won’t.
00:04:31.271,00:04:34.524,Three men. 254 kilos.
00:04:34.608,00:04:36.526,That was the deal.
00:04:42.866,00:04:46.786,Three men. 254 kilos.
00:04:46.870,00:04:48.788,Seat belts.
00:05:31.790,00:05:33.875,See what I mean about the shocks?
00:05:39.422,00:05:40.924,Now it’s time.
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.727,Look out! Get out of the way!
00:05:56.648,00:05:58.232,Wrong way! Wrong way!
00:05:58.316,00:06:00.193,Jesus. It’s the wrong way.
00:06:04.155,00:06:06.283,"Oh, move away!"
00:06:07.784,00:06:09.869,Look out! Look out!
00:06:09.953,00:06:12.413,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:06:25.635,00:06:28.138,- Yes! - Yes! Yeah!
00:06:30.056,00:06:32.391,"Go, go, go!"
00:06:32.475,00:06:34.561,"Oh, merde!"
00:06:46.865,00:06:47.907,Shit.
00:07:17.354,00:07:18.854,"No. No, no!"
00:07:18.938,00:07:21.858,"If you don’t mind, I just conditioned the leather back there."
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.823,Not yet.
00:07:39.959,00:07:41.628,Stop!
00:07:48.051,00:07:51.012,- What are you doing? Don’t stop now. Do somethin’! - Do somethin’!
00:07:51.096,00:07:53.139,- What are you thinking? - What are we doing now?
00:07:55.892,00:07:57.351,Belt!
00:07:59.896,00:08:01.731,"- No. No. - No, no, no!"
00:08:25.171,00:08:27.257,"Your gun, please."
00:09:19.476,00:09:21.143,Police! Stop!
00:09:21.227,00:09:23.480,Stop! Police!
00:09:27.942,00:09:30.320,I’m fed up with this car chase!
00:09:55.011,00:09:58.807,You gave me too much.
00:10:00.850,00:10:03.269,"The deal was this far, no further."
00:10:03.353,00:10:06.105,The deal is the deal. Rule number one.
00:10:06.189,00:10:08.650,Rules are meant to be broken.
00:10:11.861,00:10:15.281,Let’s go. Get in the car.
00:10:15.365,00:10:17.283,Come on! Hurry!
00:11:14.132,00:11:17.468,Let me show you what we do to people who left it back in ’Nam on the base.
00:11:25.351,00:11:27.728,What could be worse than death?
00:11:29.939,00:11:33.651,The Argentinean government reaffirmed its commitment...
00:11:33.735,00:11:36.237,to meeting the I.M.F.’s target this year.
00:11:36.321,00:11:40.699,"And yesterday, in Nice, four men robbed the Alliance Investment Corporation."
00:11:40.783,00:11:43.202,One man died on the sidewalk.
00:11:43.286,00:11:46.247,The others were apprehended early this morning...
00:11:46.331,00:11:51.544,when they took a wrong turn on a one-way street in Avignon and ran into a taxicab.
00:11:51.628,00:11:56.298,"The police said, were it not for their poor driving habits, the 20 million euros in bearer bonds..."
00:11:56.382,00:12:00.553,would have been cashed and gone by this afternoon.
00:12:00.637,00:12:06.892,"In other news, the stock market closed– I always say the way a man treats his car..."
00:12:06.976,00:12:08.895,is how he treats himself.
00:12:13.816,00:12:16.819,"You have a good sense of humor for a foreigner, Monsieur Frank."
00:12:16.903,00:12:22.116,Like the French. Sly wit. Just the right amount of flavor.
00:12:22.200,00:12:25.327,Been out driving?
00:12:25.411,00:12:27.496,Want to come in for a coffee?
00:12:27.580,00:12:30.291,"Uh, thank you, but I have a lot of stops to make."
00:12:30.375,00:12:32.251,Eighty-eight to be exact.
00:12:32.335,00:12:34.879,That’s a lot of stops.
00:12:34.963,00:12:39.258,A lot of 1999 black BMW 765s...
00:12:39.342,00:12:42.803,with 06 in the license plates to check out.
00:12:42.887,00:12:46.473,"Ah, it’s a very popular car with a certain type down here."
00:12:46.557,00:12:51.270,You’ve seen them. They come over from Italy in those very expensive suits...
00:12:51.354,00:12:55.274,and the young pretty girls with the big jewelry and too much makeup.
00:12:55.358,00:12:58.319,Very... mafia.
00:12:58.403,00:13:01.363,There was a robbery. A getaway.
00:13:01.447,00:13:05.159,Some very fancy driving.
00:13:05.243,00:13:09.705,By someone in a 1999 black BMW 735?
00:13:09.789,00:13:12.333,With 06 in the plate.
00:13:15.211,00:13:17.129,Not for a while.
00:13:17.213,00:13:21.508,I love Nice. The food. The way they grill fish.
00:13:21.592,00:13:24.803,No place else in France does it the way they do in Nice.
00:13:24.887,00:13:29.725,And the women– I prefer the women there.
00:13:29.809,00:13:32.061,They are more... complicated...
00:13:33.604,00:13:35.814,than the local variety.
00:13:35.898,00:13:37.859,Don’t you think?
00:13:38.901,00:13:41.403,I don’t particularly like complicated.
00:13:41.487,00:13:44.657,You like to keep it simple.
00:13:44.741,00:13:50.537,"Oh, you know, uh, ever since I’m a little boy, military people have always intrigued me."
00:13:50.621,00:13:52.498,I’m ex-military.
00:13:52.582,00:13:55.418,I am an ex-little boy.
00:14:01.257,00:14:04.426,Sure you don’t have time for a coffee?
00:14:04.510,00:14:08.222,"Everything is always so neat with you, Monsieur Frank."
00:14:10.349,00:14:14.061,Nothing ever out of place.
00:14:10.349,00:14:17.607,"I’ll take that as a compliment, coming from a man who pays attention to every detail."
00:14:19.442,00:14:23.071,Maybe I’ll come back later for that coffee.
00:14:24.655,00:14:27.784,Door’s always open to you.
00:14:41.172,00:14:43.758,I’m looking for a transporter.
00:14:49.472,00:14:52.725,- One bag. That’s it. - Dimensions?
00:14:54.310,00:14:55.978,Be specific.
00:14:56.062,00:14:58.063,One meter 50 by half meter.
00:14:58.147,00:15:01.233,- Weight. - Fifty kilos. Not more.
00:15:04.654,00:15:07.114,Destination?
00:15:07.198,00:15:10.993,You’re delivering to Mr.– Rule two: No names.
00:15:13.329,00:15:15.080,Time of pickup?
00:15:15.164,00:15:18.835,"7:00 in the morning, at the front door."
00:15:20.378,00:15:25.382,A package. One meter 50 by 50. Fifty kilos. 250 kilometers.
00:15:25.466,00:15:29.928,"Traveling within the speed limit, one stop for refreshments, 40,000."
00:15:30.012,00:15:33.265,"Half now, half on delivery. Delivery will be at noon."
00:15:33.349,00:15:36.477,"If no one’s there, it is not my responsibility. I’ll leave the package."
00:15:36.561,00:15:40.272,"Once we make a deal, the terms of that deal cannot be changed or renegotiated."
00:15:40.356,00:15:42.984,- Another rule? - It’s rule number one.
00:15:43.943,00:15:46.654,Do we have a deal?
00:15:51.784,00:15:55.872,- You’re very precise. - Transportation is a precise business.
00:16:57.642,00:16:59.518,Flat.
00:19:21.327,00:19:23.329,Hi.
00:19:26.582,00:19:28.834,"Now, don’t move. I’m not gonna hurt you."
00:19:28.918,00:19:31.169,I’m just gonna make a little hole so you can drink. That’s all.
00:19:46.936,00:19:48.938,Come on. Drink.
00:19:52.942,00:19:54.944,Slowly.
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.580,Okay. Okay. That’s enough.
00:20:50.124,00:20:53.460,"I’m going to take the tape off. If you scream, I’ll have to kill you. Understand?"
00:20:53.544,00:20:56.338,Mmm. Mmm.
00:20:56.422,00:20:58.632,Ay! I got to pee.
00:20:59.675,00:21:02.094,You want me to do it in your car?
00:21:04.972,00:21:06.891,- Okay. - Mmm.
00:21:15.316,00:21:18.694,"I’m gonna take my knife out, so don’t scream, okay? It’s to cut you free."
00:21:24.033,00:21:26.202,You don’t need your mouth to pee.
00:21:33.292,00:21:35.336,You have one minute.
00:21:38.672,00:21:52.978,"Fifty-five, 54, 53, 52– Breakin’ the rules, Frank."
00:21:53.062,00:21:55.064,Not good to break the rules.
00:22:03.405,00:22:05.699,Fifteen.
00:22:08.911,00:22:10.913,Seven.
00:22:13.499,00:22:15.500,Two.
00:22:15.584,00:22:17.586,Time’s up.
00:22:19.964,00:22:22.633,Don’t make me drag you out.
00:22:34.937,00:22:36.939,Shit.
00:23:21.400,00:23:23.319,"No. Please, no!"
00:23:25.070,00:23:27.072,Rule three: Never look in the package.
00:23:27.156,00:23:30.242,"Hope you enjoyed your pee, ’cause it’s your last on this trip."
00:24:01.315,00:24:03.609,See what comes of breakin’ the rules?
00:24:18.832,00:24:21.626,Jerk.
00:24:46.402,00:24:49.154,- You’re late. - Ran into a little problem.
00:24:50.239,00:24:52.574,Nothin’ serious?
00:24:55.285,00:24:57.871,Nothin’ serious.
00:25:10.801,00:25:12.677,You open the package?
00:25:12.761,00:25:15.847,Rule three: Never open the package.
00:25:18.767,00:25:23.480,Rules. You can’t get anything done in a world without rules.
00:25:23.564,00:25:25.690,"You’re a foreigner, right?"
00:25:25.774,00:25:28.568,It’s a nice little thing you’ve got goin’ for yourself here.
00:25:28.652,00:25:32.197,High-class. Good reputation.
00:25:32.281,00:25:34.199,I didn’t get your name.
00:25:34.283,00:25:36.868,Rule two: No names.
00:25:36.952,00:25:38.954,Of course.
00:25:51.341,00:25:54.010,You don’t count it.
00:25:54.094,00:25:56.304,Why? Should I?
00:25:56.388,00:25:59.308,No. No.
00:26:04.605,00:26:08.316,"You know, I was wondering..."
00:26:08.400,00:26:12.237,if you wouldn’t mind transporting something for me.
00:26:12.321,00:26:14.572,"That’s what you do, right?"
00:26:14.656,00:26:16.992,You deliver. No questions asked.
00:26:20.871,00:26:23.123,- Why not? - Mmm.
00:26:26.084,00:26:28.545,Weight?
00:26:30.130,00:26:32.006,Maybe a kilo.
00:26:32.090,00:26:34.676,Destination.
00:26:34.760,00:26:36.636,306 Rue du Lac.
00:26:36.720,00:26:40.557,"A Mr.– Oh, right. I forgot."
00:26:40.641,00:26:42.518,Rule two.
00:27:02.746,00:27:04.748,I like him.
00:28:38.842,00:29:13.502,What the f– Where is he?
00:31:39.648,00:31:42.066,You’re like dog shit.
00:31:42.150,00:31:44.819,You’re everywhere. Yeah.
00:31:44.903,00:31:47.739,I know you want to pee. All you want to do is pee.
00:31:56.540,00:31:58.583,Shit.
00:32:13.974,00:32:17.769,"Frank, you stupid shit."
00:33:45.190,00:33:47.817,I ask the questions. You answer the questions.
00:33:47.901,00:33:50.111,No long speeches. Just keep it simple. Got it?
00:33:54.407,00:33:56.409,Who are you?
00:33:56.493,00:34:03.040,My name is Lai. I come from– I ask the questions. You answer the questions.
00:34:03.124,00:34:06.336,"Nothing more, nothing less. You want to try again?"
00:34:11.299,00:34:13.968,What kind of shit am I in?
00:34:14.052,00:34:50.213,Very deep shit. Those guys– Sorry! Sorry! I won’t say any– Bon appétit.
00:34:51.214,00:34:53.883,- Where are you going? - To bed.
00:34:53.967,00:34:56.010,Can’t think straight when I’m tired.
00:34:56.094,00:34:58.679,"A good night’s sleep, I always see things better."
00:34:58.763,00:35:01.349,- Can I leave? - Be my guest.
00:36:56.256,00:36:59.091,Hey.
00:36:59.175,00:37:01.552,Are you comfortable?
00:37:01.636,00:37:04.388,Boss– Shh. Save your strength.
00:37:04.472,00:37:08.100,Just tell me. Who did this?
00:37:08.184,00:37:10.979,The transporter.
00:37:12.063,00:37:13.981,The transporter’s dead.
00:37:14.065,00:37:16.067,He’s not.
00:37:21.489,00:37:23.074,Believe me.
00:37:24.993,00:37:26.911,I believe you.
00:37:26.995,00:37:31.291,And the police– They were here?
00:37:32.834,00:37:36.128,"- You told ’em nothing, right? - Right."
00:37:36.212,00:37:39.007,Of course.
00:37:40.133,00:37:42.760,You couldn’t talk.
00:37:42.844,00:37:44.679,Yeah.
00:37:48.975,00:37:50.935,Let’s keep it that way.
00:38:50.245,00:38:52.913,I picked them from the garden outside.
00:38:52.997,00:38:55.666,I hope you don’t mind.
00:38:55.750,00:39:00.337,"I didn’t know if you liked coffee or tea, so I made both."
00:39:13.351,00:39:18.606,"I hope you like, uh, madeleines."
00:39:18.690,00:39:20.775,Try one.
00:39:23.778,00:39:25.196,Careful.
00:39:25.280,00:39:26.573,It’s hot.
00:39:29.450,00:39:30.952,Good?
00:39:36.958,00:39:38.459,Let me.
00:39:40.044,00:39:42.046,I like it quiet in the morning.
00:39:42.130,00:39:44.131,Yes. Quiet in the morning.
00:39:44.215,00:39:46.842,Me too. Me too. I’m the same way.
00:39:46.926,00:39:49.304,I like very quiet.
00:39:51.472,00:39:53.308,Sorry.
00:39:59.230,00:40:00.815,Are you looking for milk?
00:40:02.317,00:40:04.318,"Ah, there’s milk at the door."
00:40:04.402,00:40:06.738,Stay. Stay. I’ll go.
00:40:16.748,00:40:18.666,And you are?
00:40:18.750,00:40:22.419,The new cook. Is Monsieur Frank in?
00:40:22.503,00:40:25.756,Ah. Monsieur Frank.
00:40:25.840,00:40:28.133,Is your invitation for coffee still open?
00:40:28.217,00:40:30.135,Sure. Come on. Please. Mm-hmm.
00:40:30.219,00:40:32.221,Sit.
00:40:33.348,00:40:35.266,Madeleine?
00:40:35.350,00:40:38.435,Yes. I’ll bring some more.
00:40:38.519,00:40:42.940,Ah. My mother used to make fresh madeleines every morning.
00:40:43.024,00:40:47.278,"I smell them, and my whole childhood comes back in one big flood."
00:40:47.362,00:40:50.781,"Like Proust. You ever read Proust, Monsieur Frank?"
00:40:50.865,00:40:52.324,Nope.
00:40:52.408,00:40:55.828,He’s fantastic. Memory like a steel trap.
00:40:55.912,00:40:58.289,He would have been a great cop. Real determined.
00:40:58.373,00:40:59.999,Milk?
00:41:01.709,00:41:04.962,Thank you. Ah.
00:41:05.046,00:41:07.548,I used to have a memory like Proust.
00:41:07.632,00:41:09.675,Like a filing cabinet up there.
00:41:09.759,00:41:12.303,I would see something and remember it like that.
00:41:12.387,00:41:16.974,"Like, uh, license plates. I could see a plate, and it was printed in my head."
00:41:17.058,00:41:19.268,Now I need all the help I can get...
00:41:19.352,00:41:22.313,"remembering, uh, whose plate goes with whose car."
00:41:22.397,00:41:25.316,"Like, uh, this one."
00:41:27.568,00:41:29.820,That’s mine.
00:41:29.904,00:41:32.156,Memories.
00:41:32.240,00:41:35.034,Where’s the rest of the car?
00:41:35.118,00:41:36.994,It was stolen.
00:41:37.078,00:41:42.708,"I went down to Fréjus to pick up a few things. When I came out of the market, it was– Gone."
00:41:42.792,00:41:45.878,- You report it? - That’s the first on my list of things to do today.
00:41:45.962,00:41:48.881,It’s a long walk from Fréjus. How did you get home?
00:41:48.965,00:41:50.925,I brought him.
00:41:52.760,00:41:55.179,I saw him walking along the dark road.
00:41:55.263,00:41:59.726,"A risky thing, picking up a stranger on a dark road."
00:42:00.810,00:42:02.729,He had a kind face.
00:42:06.190,00:42:09.193,- I didn’t see a car outside. - It’s in the garage.
00:42:09.277,00:42:11.612,- May I see it? - Mm-hmm.
00:42:31.841,00:42:34.594,Ah. Pretty nice car for a cook.
00:42:36.804,00:42:39.765,Some people have a problem with the Germans.
00:42:39.849,00:42:43.394,They are too aggressive. They take up the best beaches in summer.
00:42:43.478,00:42:45.438,They can’t cook worth a damn.
00:42:48.524,00:42:53.487,I say anyone makes such great cars can’t be all bad.
00:42:53.571,00:42:57.950,"I would say your intuition worked out very well for Monsieur Frank, mademoiselle."
00:42:58.034,00:43:00.536,Worked out for both of us.
00:43:05.208,00:43:09.420,Bon. Uh– My intuition says this is...
00:43:09.504,00:43:11.964,probably a good time for me to go file my report.
00:43:12.048,00:43:14.925,Where’s the rest of my car?
00:43:15.009,00:43:18.846,I almost forgot. It was blown to pieces at a rest stop.
00:43:20.181,00:43:23.434,What’s left of it is down at the lab.
00:43:23.518,00:43:27.730,They are trying to separate what was left of the two cops in the trunk...
00:43:27.814,00:43:30.107,from the rest of it.
00:43:30.191,00:43:33.235,"But, uh, you wouldn’t know anything about that."
00:43:33.319,00:43:36.196,No.
00:43:36.280,00:43:38.824,Thank you for the coffee and the memories.
00:43:38.908,00:43:40.659,Come back anytime.
00:43:40.743,00:43:44.496,Would you mind walking me?
00:43:44.580,00:43:48.167,"You have always been very quiet about your business, Monsieur Frank."
00:43:48.251,00:43:51.211,I appreciate that. Less work for mother.
00:43:51.295,00:43:55.132,But this business at the rest stop. That is not very quiet.
00:43:55.216,00:43:59.678,I don’t suppose you would like to tell me something besides a stolen car story?
00:43:59.762,00:44:02.765,"If I had one, I would."
00:44:02.849,00:44:07.811,"that when the two of you show up in my office after lunch, you do have one."
00:44:07.895,00:44:10.064,A better one than you currently have.
00:44:17.071,00:44:21.825,"You are the one he wants to see, not me."
00:44:21.909,00:44:23.994,Please. I have to think.
00:44:24.078,00:44:25.996,You were supposed to think last night.
00:44:26.080,00:44:28.707,"Yeah, well, last night I had nightmares..."
00:44:28.791,00:44:33.212,"about a girl who came into my nice, quiet life, screwed it all up."
00:44:33.296,00:44:36.381,"Everything she touched broke, and every move she made turned into a catastrophe."
00:44:36.465,00:44:38.759,Okay. Sorry.
00:44:41.095,00:44:45.766,I’m still wondering if I want to know everything or nothing about you.
00:44:53.941,00:44:55.859,What?
00:44:55.943,00:44:59.613,It’s the quiet.
00:45:02.617,00:45:05.453,Yeah. Not this quiet.
00:45:24.639,00:45:26.598,You okay?
00:45:26.682,00:45:28.601,Good. Let’s go.
00:45:38.486,00:45:39.779,"Go, go, go!"
00:45:52.833,00:45:55.127,No. Don’t stay there!
00:46:22.863,00:46:24.198,Frank!
00:46:26.701,00:46:28.327,Come on. Give me your hand.
00:46:50.891,00:46:53.227,Come on.
00:46:55.396,00:46:56.980,Come on. Get in. Get in!
00:46:57.064,00:46:58.983,No! No!
00:47:02.069,00:47:04.821,"Lai, look! Come on. Do you want to die?"
00:47:04.905,00:47:06.240,Get in!
00:47:29.305,00:47:31.348,Calm down. Okay?
00:47:31.432,00:47:33.725,Don’t worry. You okay?
00:47:33.809,00:47:36.561,Stay here. I’m comin’ back.
00:47:36.645,00:47:38.564,Wait! Wait!
00:47:51.994,00:47:54.455,Put it on.
00:47:55.539,00:47:57.457,You okay?
00:47:57.541,00:47:59.835,Sure? Okay. Let’s go.
00:49:39.810,00:49:41.978,Frank.
00:49:42.062,00:49:43.814,Is this your house?
00:49:53.407,00:49:55.576,Frank.
00:50:02.166,00:50:04.585,Should mind my own goddamn business.
00:50:06.545,00:50:10.006,Simple rule. Simple little rule.
00:50:10.090,00:50:13.093,There’s gotta be some dry clothes in this house.
00:50:14.470,00:50:17.222,Don’t open the package.
00:50:17.306,00:50:20.017,Nothin’ but trouble you open the goddamn package.
00:50:21.101,00:50:23.020,Frank.
00:50:27.483,00:50:30.277,- What are you doing? - Making up for the trouble.
00:50:36.617,00:50:40.287,Wait. Wait. Why are you making– No more questions.
00:50:42.665,00:50:45.876,Wait. I don’t like it when things get complicated.
00:50:45.960,00:50:48.503,You like things simple.
00:50:48.587,00:50:50.589,Very simple.
00:51:06.438,00:51:09.733,I’m not so clear about the house. Could you explain?
00:51:10.693,00:51:15.780,"Mmm. One more time. After I left– After you left, we went for a walk on the beach, had a swim."
00:51:15.864,00:51:17.741,Where again?
00:51:17.825,00:51:20.577,- Anyone else swimming at that time? - No.
00:51:20.661,00:51:23.455,Did you see anybody else swimming?
00:51:23.539,00:51:38.803,"So, you took a walk, had a swim... on a beach where no one else was swimming, past the point, where you can’t see or be seen from the beach on either side, which makes witnesses a little hard to come by."
00:51:38.887,00:51:41.473,That’s the point of a romantic swim.
00:51:41.557,00:51:43.684,Who wants witnesses?
00:51:45.853,00:51:49.522,"- And then? - Then we came back to the house, found it on fire."
00:51:49.606,00:51:52.943,- Just like that? On fire? - Yes.
00:51:53.027,00:51:57.948,"And the 5,000 rounds of spent ammo my men found all around the house?"
00:51:58.032,00:52:03.912,"- Maybe they had the wrong house. - Monsieur Frank, people with this kind of firepower..."
00:52:03.996,00:52:06.957,do not make mistakes about who they visit.
00:52:08.208,00:52:09.876,Who would want you this dead?
00:52:09.960,00:52:11.711,I don’t know.
00:52:11.795,00:52:14.881,- Any problems with a client? - I don’t have clients.
00:52:14.965,00:52:17.968,I’m retired. I live on my army pension. You know that.
00:52:18.052,00:52:21.638,You have all the facts of who I am and who I was. You’ve had them for years.
00:52:21.722,00:52:24.516,Any enemies you can think of? People from the past?
00:52:24.600,00:52:26.643,I left the past behind when I moved here.
00:52:26.727,00:52:29.479,Hmm. A past like yours...
00:52:29.563,00:52:31.690,you never leave behind.
00:52:34.568,00:52:38.238,I’ll just be a moment. Don’t leave.
00:52:52.628,00:52:56.881,- What are you doin’? - Computers know everything. You just need a password.
00:52:56.965,00:52:59.301,"What are you, nuts? We’re in a police station."
00:52:59.385,00:53:04.014,You’re always complaining. Except when we make love. Then you say nothing.
00:53:19.655,00:53:22.241,Ah.
00:53:27.788,00:53:30.957,"La, la, la. Hello."
00:53:31.041,00:53:32.584,See?
00:53:51.186,00:53:54.064,"So, where will you be staying?"
00:53:54.148,00:53:56.900,"Well, my cousin has a small hotel."
00:53:57.985,00:54:00.111,"Thanks, but we’ll manage."
00:54:00.195,00:54:03.239,"Without money, could be hard."
00:54:03.323,00:54:06.576,"Here. It’s not much, but at least you won’t go hungry."
00:54:06.660,00:54:08.996,Thank you.
00:54:20.966,00:54:23.301,- Where you goin’? - Going to see that guy.
00:54:23.385,00:54:25.887,- Good luck. - One moment.
00:54:25.971,00:54:28.807,- You’re not coming? - No.
00:54:28.891,00:54:31.893,But he blew up your car.
00:54:31.977,00:54:34.396,He burned your house.
00:54:34.480,00:54:37.315,He tried to kill you.
00:54:37.399,00:54:39.317,Look. I’m gonna give you some advice.
00:54:39.401,00:54:41.903,I don’t know what you’re into. I don’t care what you’re into.
00:54:41.987,00:54:45.281,But whoever wanted you dead thinks you’re dead. You have a free pass to start over.
00:54:45.365,00:54:47.868,Here’s the advice: Start over.
00:54:53.874,00:54:56.584,There are 400 people...
00:54:56.668,00:55:00.339,dying in a container on a ship.
00:55:03.050,00:55:05.593,My father.
00:55:05.677,00:55:08.096,My sisters.
00:55:08.180,00:55:10.807,The ship arrives today.
00:55:10.891,00:55:14.144,They will make my father a slave.
00:55:14.228,00:55:18.314,The only one who knows the container number...
00:55:18.398,00:55:20.817,is that guy.
00:55:20.901,00:55:22.735,You’re very good.
00:55:22.819,00:55:24.863,What do you mean?
00:55:24.947,00:55:27.323,From the moment you saw those pictures in my house...
00:55:27.407,00:55:29.576,you were setting me up to get involved in this.
00:55:29.660,00:55:33.830,Breakfast. Giving the excuse to the cop to help me. One lie after another.
00:55:35.707,00:55:37.667,Not everything is a lie.
00:55:37.751,00:55:40.045,Name one thing that isn’t.
00:55:42.881,00:55:45.091,What happened in the house...
00:55:45.175,00:55:47.135,between us.
00:55:47.219,00:55:49.680,That was not a lie.
00:55:52.516,00:55:54.392,You were a soldier.
00:55:54.476,00:55:57.270,Your job was to save people.
00:55:57.354,00:56:00.190,- Past tense. - What does that mean?
00:56:00.274,00:56:02.484,Means I got tired of seeing my best efforts...
00:56:02.568,00:56:06.112,get turned into bullshit by the same people who pay me to do the job.
00:56:06.196,00:56:11.076,"- No one cared. - This time, I care."
00:56:38.854,00:56:40.980,- Bonjour. - Bonjour.
00:56:41.064,00:56:43.650,No phone calls for half an hour?
00:56:43.734,00:56:45.568,Hello. Surprise.
00:56:52.909,00:56:54.953,Sit.
00:57:06.256,00:57:08.633,Put your hands where I can see ’em.
00:57:08.717,00:57:13.137,"So, before we get to the heart of the matter, I have one question for you."
00:57:13.221,00:57:15.890,- Why’d you try to kill me? - You lied to me.
00:57:15.974,00:57:19.936,You opened the package. You broke the rules. Your rules.
00:57:20.020,00:57:23.190,What’d you expect me to do? Recommend you for another job?
00:57:26.735,00:57:28.487,What’s the ship number?
00:57:31.365,00:57:34.450,"Mr. Transporter, we can both agree."
00:57:34.534,00:57:36.661,I answered your first question politely.
00:57:36.745,00:57:38.663,I won’t answer any more.
00:57:38.747,00:57:41.833,So I suggest you kill me right now...
00:57:42.709,00:57:45.379,and go screw yourself.
00:57:47.547,00:57:49.508,I can’t find anything.
00:57:55.889,00:57:58.141,"Oh, poor Frank."
00:57:58.225,00:58:02.020,What’d she tell you? We’re smuggling people in containers? I tell you.
00:58:02.104,00:58:04.230,Lai’s the perfect name for her.
00:58:04.314,00:58:05.732,Mr. Kwai’s on the way up.
00:58:05.816,00:58:08.818,Your father’s here. He’ll really get a kick out of this.
00:58:08.902,00:58:12.488,I thought your father was in a container.
00:58:12.572,00:58:16.075,There are 400 people in that container.
00:58:16.159,00:58:17.869,Stay where you are.
00:58:17.953,00:58:21.039,"She’s a real heartbreaker, isn’t she, Frank?"
00:58:22.749,00:58:24.751,"Ten seconds, two choices."
00:58:24.835,00:58:28.546,The information on the paper or your brains on the desk. Now tell me I’m lying.
00:58:28.630,00:58:30.923,"- Nine, eight– - Lai. Lai."
00:58:31.007,00:58:33.551,- Give me the gun. - I don’t know what you’re talking about.
00:58:33.635,00:58:40.392,"...five, four, three, two– One. Shoot."
00:58:56.658,00:58:58.660,Lai.
00:58:59.661,00:59:01.663,Come on now.
00:59:01.747,00:59:03.623,Put it down.
00:59:05.667,00:59:08.545,We’ll talk.
00:59:09.796,00:59:12.424,She thinks we’re smuggling people in containers.
00:59:13.967,00:59:16.428,I don’t know where you get these ideas.
00:59:20.974,00:59:23.726,Would you kill your own father?
00:59:23.810,00:59:26.813,Please. I’m begging you.
00:59:26.897,00:59:28.815,Stop what you are doing.
00:59:28.899,00:59:32.068,I do what I do. I am who I am.
00:59:32.152,00:59:36.906,"I’ll never change. So, if you’re going to kill me, kill me."
00:59:36.990,00:59:41.536,"But if you don’t, get this gun out of my face."
00:59:44.206,00:59:45.915,Give me.
00:59:47.417,00:59:50.753,"I know he’s innocent. Oh, you have such a good heart."
00:59:50.837,00:59:54.048,Always interested in saving innocent people.
00:59:54.132,00:59:59.638,"Well, here’s your big chance. Drop your gun, and you will save one."
01:00:05.018,01:00:07.145,- Kill him! - No!
01:00:09.689,01:00:11.774,- The police are on their way up. - What now?
01:00:11.858,01:00:14.277,Take her.
01:00:34.297,01:00:37.633,"Just for the record, there are 400 people in that container."
01:00:37.717,01:00:41.637,Only 395 made it here alive.
01:00:41.721,01:00:43.473,Frank!
01:00:46.893,01:00:51.230,- Inspector. Am I glad you’re here. - What is this?
01:00:51.314,01:00:54.734,This man used my partner’s daughter here to try and blackmail us.
01:00:54.818,01:00:57.487,"Luckily, my security got the drop on him."
01:00:57.571,01:01:01.657,"I wanna press charges– kidnapping, extortion, assault."
01:01:01.741,01:01:04.660,"- I know this man. - Well, I suppose in your business..."
01:01:04.744,01:01:07.080,you have to know all types.
01:01:09.165,01:01:11.083,"Now, should I call my lawyer?"
01:01:11.167,01:01:13.378,We’ll handle it.
01:01:18.216,01:01:21.427,I’ll expect all of you down at my office to give your statements.
01:01:21.511,01:01:25.515,"As soon as I contact my lawyer, we’ll be more than happy to oblige."
01:01:45.160,01:01:48.871,"The doctor said you will have a headache for a few days, and then everything..."
01:01:48.955,01:01:50.873,will go back to normal.
01:01:50.957,01:01:53.584,I think you should be more concerned...
01:01:53.668,01:01:55.962,with where you are.
01:01:57.631,01:01:59.590,What got into you?
01:01:59.674,01:02:02.635,- You were always so careful. - I’ve got to get out of here.
01:02:02.719,01:02:08.057,"Oh, well, with the charges they filed, you will not be getting out for a very long time."
01:02:08.141,01:02:10.476,Assaulting a distinguished member...
01:02:10.560,01:02:15.565,"of the international business community, kidnapping his daughter, extortion."
01:02:15.649,01:02:18.609,"I’m sorry, Frank."
01:02:18.693,01:02:29.245,"I would like to help you, but if you continue with the same old story, I’m retired, living on a pension– I need fresh, Frank."
01:02:29.329,01:02:30.872,I need new.
01:02:30.956,01:02:33.166,"For once, I need the truth."
01:02:36.169,01:02:38.254,Okay.
01:02:38.338,01:02:40.506,They’re smuggling people...
01:02:40.590,01:02:43.343,from Asia through Marseille in containers.
01:02:45.887,01:02:49.015,- You know this for fact? - The girl told me.
01:02:49.099,01:02:51.851,- You believe her? - Yes.
01:02:51.935,01:02:54.479,"In French we have a saying, Never believe the cook."
01:02:56.940,01:02:59.567,- She’s not the cook. - Oh.
01:02:59.651,01:03:01.819,I suspected.
01:03:01.903,01:03:04.155,"You know, Frank, no one is perfect."
01:03:04.239,01:03:07.199,"- So you’re saying you’re gonna do nothing? - No, I’m saying..."
01:03:07.283,01:03:09.285,I’m going to start an investigation.
01:03:09.369,01:03:12.622,"And in the meantime, the 400 people in the container could be dead already."
01:03:12.706,01:03:14.624,But what am I supposed to do?
01:03:14.708,01:03:17.168,- There are laws. - Did it ever occur to you that sometimes...
01:03:17.252,01:03:19.170,- you have to make your own law? - Like you do?
01:03:19.254,01:03:21.714,"At least with me, it doesn’t take 12 months to get the job done."
01:03:21.798,01:03:25.593,"Oh, yes, I know. That’s what I admire about you, Frank."
01:03:25.677,01:03:33.309,"All that army training, all that sneaking around– A man like you could probably resolve this case in, how long?"
01:03:33.393,01:03:36.729,Twelve hours?
01:03:36.813,01:03:40.149,Less? Impressive.
01:03:40.233,01:03:42.485,You would be the perfect man for the job.
01:03:42.569,01:03:45.154,"Yes, if I were out."
01:03:45.238,01:03:47.907,"Yes, if you were out."
01:04:08.595,01:04:10.596,Anybody moves and I kill him.
01:04:47.467,01:04:52.221,"If this is how you transport, I’m amazed you get any work at all."
01:04:52.305,01:04:54.349,Come on. Give me a hand.
01:05:02.899,01:05:04.901,Maybe I should go with you?
01:05:06.319,01:05:09.071,"Thanks, but, uh, I’m better alone."
01:05:09.155,01:05:12.241,That is a very small boat to fight a very big war.
01:05:12.325,01:05:15.369,Yep. But it’s a good boat.
01:05:15.453,01:05:20.166,"Frank, here. You’ll need it."
01:05:23.503,01:05:25.672,Or maybe not.
01:06:53.259,01:06:56.137,The shipment’s cleared. Here’s the paperwork.
01:06:56.221,01:06:59.181,Take the highway all the way to the first exit– Lyon.
01:06:59.265,01:07:03.561,Go straight to the warehouse. We’ll be right behind you just in case.
01:07:28.503,01:07:30.629,"Lai, dear."
01:07:37.887,01:07:41.891,I spent thousands of dollars for you to go to school and learn English.
01:07:41.975,01:07:45.436,- The least you can do is speak it. - I hate you.
01:07:49.732,01:07:52.068,I’m still your father.
01:07:53.403,01:07:55.446,Get her out of here!
01:08:14.465,01:08:16.592,Give me a minute.
01:08:43.745,01:08:46.122,Keep him alive.
01:09:28.581,01:09:30.708,Let’s go!
01:10:26.806,01:10:28.474,"No, don’t!"
01:10:30.852,01:10:33.479,Let’s go!
01:17:45.369,01:17:47.287,Good morning.
01:17:51.000,01:17:54.086,This plane is not for tourists.
01:17:55.754,01:17:58.674,I’m not a tourist.
01:18:21.113,01:18:24.366,Call this guy and tell him to meet me.
01:18:24.450,01:18:26.868,Where?
01:18:26.952,01:18:28.913,Down there.
01:18:56.857,01:18:58.609,Here!
01:19:04.657,01:19:06.283,Careful!
01:19:50.202,01:19:52.204,Move up.
01:20:14.810,01:20:16.145,Now.
01:22:07.256,01:22:08.924,Get closer!
01:22:14.012,01:22:16.140,"- Steady! - No, Dad, stop!"
01:24:00.452,01:24:02.912,Hands on your head.
01:24:02.996,01:24:04.957,Move!
01:24:06.792,01:24:11.129,"Watch her. If she moves or I don’t return, shoot her!"
01:24:13.632,01:24:15.550,To the water.
01:24:15.634,01:24:18.470,I’m really not in the mood for a swim.
01:24:21.306,01:24:24.517,"So, how did a lowlife like you end up with my daughter?"
01:24:24.601,01:24:26.895,I found her in a bag. Isn’t that where you left her?
01:24:26.979,01:24:29.481,You know nothing. Move!
01:24:32.651,01:24:36.237,"You got involved with the wrong girl, you dumb shit."
01:24:36.321,01:24:38.781,The delivery will be made.
01:24:38.865,01:24:42.577,"My daughter will get over it. If I’m lucky, maybe she’ll see the light."
01:24:48.375,01:24:51.586,"Yeah, if she’s lucky, maybe you’ll get hit by a truck."
01:24:51.670,01:24:55.256,What do you know?
01:24:51.670,01:24:57.926,"I know she’ll never stop being who she is, and she’ll never be you or anything like you."
01:24:58.010,01:25:01.179,"She’ll come around, but you won’t be here to see it."
01:25:12.816,01:25:17.195,I guess she won’t be coming around after all.
01:25:18.697,01:25:21.449,Turn around!
01:25:21.533,01:25:23.368,Makes no difference to me.
01:25:48.602,01:25:54.024,"He was a bastard, but he was still my father."
01:26:13.627,01:26:16.254,I guess I underestimated you.
