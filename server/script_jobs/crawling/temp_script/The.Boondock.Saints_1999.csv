00:00:42.375,00:00:43.668,hallowed be thy name.
00:00:44.294,00:00:49.758,"Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done… on Earth as it is in heaven."
00:00:50.967,00:01:00.226,Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
00:01:00.310,00:01:05.648,And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
00:01:06.524,00:01:13.698,"For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory now and forever."
00:01:20.163,00:01:25.919,"Thank you, Father Macklepenny for coming all the way across town to be our guest speaker."
00:01:30.840,00:01:38.139,and my hand takes hold on judgment… I will take vengeance upon mine enemies.
00:01:39.516,00:01:41.726,And I will repay those who haste me.
00:01:43.603,00:01:48.900,"O Lord, raise me to Thy right hand and count me among Thy saints."
00:01:59.077,00:02:02.163,of the sad story of Kitty Genovese.
00:02:04.958,00:02:22.934,"As you all may remember… a long time ago, almost 30 years ago this poor soul cried out for help time and time again but no person answered her calls."
00:02:25.270,00:02:30.483,"Though many saw, no one so much as called the police."
00:02:31.609,00:02:39.450,They all just watched as Kitty was being stabbed to death in broad daylight.
00:02:40.201,00:02:44.789,They watched as her assailant walked away.
00:02:46.916,00:02:51.504,"Now, we must all fear evil men."
00:02:53.381,00:03:08.229,But there is another kind of evil which we must fear most… and that is the indifference… of good men.
00:03:28.458,00:03:30.585,I do believe the monsignor's finally got the point.
00:03:31.628,00:03:32.754,Aye.
00:04:18.716,00:04:19.676,What?
00:04:31.229,00:04:33.523,Yeah. Who's the master?
00:04:40.196,00:04:43.157,You're going… You're gonna be training her today.
00:04:43.241,00:04:44.284,Aye.
00:04:52.208,00:04:55.378,"-Basically, the rule of thumb here is… -Wait. Rule of thumb?"
00:05:02.844,00:05:10.018,"In the early 1900s, it was legal for men to beat their wives as long as they used a stick no wider than their thumb."
00:05:16.649,00:05:18.609,"Can't do much damage with that then, can we?"
00:05:18.693,00:05:20.570,Perhaps it should've been the rule of wrist.
00:05:25.908,00:05:27.910,I knew you two pricks would give me problems.
00:05:27.994,00:05:30.663,Come on. It's St. Patty's Day. It's all in good fun.
00:05:30.747,00:05:33.416,"Ah, fuck you. And, and fuck you too."
00:05:34.083,00:05:36.252,"We're sorry, all right? Just… Just relax."
00:05:37.795,00:05:38.796,Fuck.
00:06:40.983,00:06:42.443,"Hey, fuckass, give me a beer."
00:06:53.704,00:06:57.583,"Listen, boys, I've got some very bad news."
00:06:58.417,00:07:01.754,I'm gonna have to close down the bar.
00:07:01.838,00:07:06.801,"Well, the Orsons are planting up buildings all over the town, including this one."
00:07:06.884,00:07:09.137,Fuck! Ass!
00:07:09.220,00:07:11.722,And they're not letting me renew my lease.
00:07:14.809,00:07:18.521,-Maybe he can do something. -What the fuck's your boss gonna do?
00:07:18.604,00:07:21.441,"Hey, hey, hey. Listen, fellas, I don't want anyone to know."
00:07:21.524,00:07:23.609,So you keep your traps shut.
00:07:23.693,00:07:28.614,"Well, you know what they say, People in glass houses sink ships."
00:07:31.701,00:07:35.538,"Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you, like, a proverb book or something."
00:07:35.621,00:07:38.082,This mix-and-match shit's gotta go.
00:07:39.625,00:07:41.961,"A penny saved is worth two in the bush, isn't it?"
00:07:42.044,00:07:45.423,And don't cross the road if you can't get out of the kitchen.
00:07:55.308,00:08:00.396,"I am Ivan Checkov, and you, you will be closing now."
00:08:07.153,00:08:08.446,Checkov.
00:08:08.529,00:08:11.199,"Well, this here's McCoy."
00:08:11.282,00:08:13.868,"We find a Spock, we've got us an away team."
00:08:16.496,00:08:19.457,"Me in no mood for discussion. You, you stay."
00:08:19.540,00:08:21.250,"The rest of you, go now."
00:08:21.334,00:08:26.380,Why don't you make like a tree and get the fuck out of here.
00:08:31.385,00:08:33.262,"You know we've got till the week's end, right?"
00:08:33.346,00:08:35.139,"You don't have to be hard-asses, do ya?"
00:08:35.223,00:08:36.516,Yeah. It's St. Patty's Day.
00:08:36.599,00:08:37.892,-Everyone's Irish tonight. -Mmm.
00:08:37.975,00:08:40.269,Why don't you just pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
00:08:41.687,00:08:44.982,"If you won't go, we will make you go."
00:09:03.834,00:09:06.295,"So these two guys are kicking the shit out of each other, right?"
00:09:09.882,00:09:11.717,and fucking crushes this guy with it.
00:09:11.801,00:09:13.344,It makes a big bang.
00:09:38.369,00:09:41.622,Look at him. His spine's all crushed. Had to be one big motherfucker.
00:09:41.706,00:09:45.710,"Huge. Three, four hundred pounds. Fucking huge."
00:09:45.793,00:09:48.170,-That's pretty thin. -Very thin.
00:09:55.428,00:09:58.222,"Say these two guys right here, they don't even know the fucking huge guy."
00:09:58.306,00:10:01.726,They're just staggering home from a bar still all fucked up from St. Patty's last night.
00:10:01.809,00:10:03.853,They decide to take a shortcut down through the alley.
00:10:04.645,00:10:06.772,"Wrong fucking alley, huh?"
00:10:06.856,00:10:09.275,"'Cause this big motherfucker, he's just waiting for 'em, right?"
00:10:09.358,00:10:11.527,And what could be more perfect for a strong-arm robbery?
00:10:11.611,00:10:12.987,Two drunk guys all bandaged up.
00:10:13.070,00:10:15.239,"They're already injured, for Christ's sakes. Look at 'em."
00:10:15.323,00:10:16.907,These guys are stumbling through the alley.
00:10:21.579,00:10:25.416,"Hits the guy with the bandages around his head, right? Why? 'Cause he's smart."
00:10:25.499,00:10:28.294,"He knows the guy with the bandage around his ass, he ain't going nowhere."
00:10:28.377,00:10:30.880,He's going fucking nowhere.
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.799,Where are you going? Nowhere. That's right.
00:10:36.344,00:10:37.345,He ain't done yet.
00:10:37.428,00:10:40.890,"He comes over here and jumps on this guy's back, and crushes him to death."
00:10:42.558,00:10:43.893,I feel something big here.
00:10:44.852,00:10:47.021,I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of these turning up.
00:10:50.107,00:10:54.028,So now we got a huge guy theory and a serial crusher theory.
00:10:54.904,00:10:55.946,Top notch.
00:10:57.156,00:10:59.241,-What's your name? -Detective Greenly.
00:10:59.825,00:11:03.537,-Who the fuck are you? -That's who the fuck I am.
00:11:04.246,00:11:06.999,"Listen, I gotta do this by the numbers."
00:11:08.042,00:11:09.877,ID just came back on these guys.
00:11:10.461,00:11:12.671,They got connections with the Russian mob.
00:11:13.214,00:11:14.965,That makes it a federal matter.
00:11:15.049,00:11:20.221,And Agent Smecker here is heading up the investigation with our full cooperation.
00:11:20.304,00:11:22.890,-Why don't you get me a cup of coffee? -Who the hell is this?
00:11:22.973,00:11:25.017,"-A café latte, twist of lemon… -What the fuck."
00:11:25.101,00:11:27.728,"-Chief, what the fuck is this? -Sweet and low."
00:13:45.741,00:13:47.785,"Mitchell, Langley."
00:13:48.369,00:13:50.955,"-Yes, sir. -Find the manager of this building."
00:13:51.038,00:13:56.168,See if he's had any complaints of water coming down in any of the apartments starting just this morning.
00:13:56.252,00:13:58.921,"Langley, you take that building. Same thing."
00:14:00.256,00:14:03.300,"-Chaffey. Newman. -Yes, sir."
00:14:04.301,00:14:05.886,Look in the trash around their hands.
00:14:05.970,00:14:10.849,"See if you can find me two bullet casings, 50-caliber if my eyes serve me right."
00:14:12.560,00:14:15.187,"Newman, rip through this shit."
00:14:15.938,00:14:23.904,"If this was a sink… find me some metal parts. Give me a… drain cover, faucet or something."
00:14:26.156,00:14:28.117,Got it right here. It's a 50-cal.
00:14:28.200,00:14:37.042,"Chief, can you get ballistics down here and tell 'em they have to dig a 50-caliber slug out of a brick wall and locate another that's been fired through a dumpster?"
00:14:37.126,00:14:38.878,We have the best ballistics guy in the world.
00:14:38.961,00:14:41.630,-I can have him here in ten minutes. -How did you know that?
00:14:41.714,00:14:43.090,Liquid paraffin.
00:14:43.883,00:14:45.301,Came up positive.
00:14:46.260,00:14:48.554,And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
00:14:49.096,00:14:50.890,Nobody reported any gunshots.
00:14:50.973,00:14:54.435,This is an Irish neighborhood. I'm surprised you even got a phone call.
00:14:54.518,00:14:56.687,"You know, I can't find the second one, sir."
00:14:57.313,00:14:58.856,"Uh, look under the body."
00:15:02.526,00:15:03.694,"Oh, yeah, there it is."
00:15:07.031,00:15:08.365,You guys ready for this?
00:15:09.950,00:15:12.578,This was no gangland assassination.
00:15:12.661,00:15:15.205,"Though creative, it was way too sloppy."
00:15:15.289,00:15:18.626,Something went wrong here. This has personal written all over it.
00:15:18.709,00:15:22.004,"Agent Smecker. Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing."
00:15:22.087,00:15:27.217,There's no manager on the premises but they found a lady on the fourth floor who said she had water dripping down on her whole place.
00:15:27.301,00:15:29.470,"-It started just this morning. -Fourth floor, huh?"
00:15:29.553,00:15:30.429,Mm-hmm.
00:15:32.765,00:15:34.224,Then we're heading to the fifth.
00:15:34.725,00:15:37.770,"Come on. Let's get out of here. You're reaching, man."
00:15:37.853,00:15:40.356,-It's a theory. -I don't know. No way.
00:15:40.439,00:15:43.317,You know how big a guy's gotta be to do that? Fucking huge.
00:15:43.400,00:15:44.902,"Oh, really?"
00:15:44.985,00:15:48.030,I might just be wanting a bagel with my coffee.
00:15:54.370,00:15:56.330,I ain't getting him no fucking bagel.
00:16:05.422,00:16:07.591,We'll start the ass-kissing with you.
00:16:12.096,00:16:16.475,"Agent Smecker. Agent… Listen, I know this neighborhood pretty good."
00:16:16.558,00:16:18.268,There's a bar down the block named McGinty's.
00:16:18.352,00:16:20.312,It stands a good chance they were there last night.
00:16:20.396,00:16:22.564,"Good work, Mitchell. I'll check it out myself."
00:16:25.901,00:16:27.194,Wait until you feel me move.
00:16:28.195,00:16:30.489,"Ooh. So quick you couldn't even feel it go, could you?"
00:16:31.281,00:16:34.576,Let's try it again. Try it again. Look at the ceiling. See?
00:16:35.160,00:16:36.620,It's Doc.
00:16:38.998,00:16:40.165,"Thanks for coming, Doc."
00:16:41.458,00:16:42.668,Jesus Christ.
00:16:42.751,00:16:46.088,What the fuck happened? Are… are you boys all right?
00:16:46.171,00:16:47.548,We're alive.
00:16:47.631,00:16:54.555,"An FBI agent came by the bar and he left me his… He left me his… Oh, he fucking gave me this."
00:16:57.516,00:17:00.060,"We oughta turn ourselves in, tell him it was self-defense."
00:17:00.144,00:17:01.854,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what he said."
00:17:01.937,00:17:04.273,How the fuck's he know that? We haven't spoken to anyone yet.
00:17:07.109,00:17:09.695,"All right. Listen, Doc, we need you to do us a favor."
00:17:09.778,00:17:12.239,-Anything. -Just hold on to this for us.
00:17:12.322,00:17:14.033,We're gonna come back for it when we get out.
00:17:14.116,00:17:17.036,Right. Fuck! Ass!
00:17:18.704,00:17:38.515,"None of that cursing was directed at you. He's… He's a bit… I'd like to thank whichever one of you doughnut-munching, barrel-assed, pud-pulling sissies leaked this to the press."
00:17:39.850,00:17:41.769,That's just what we need now.
00:17:41.852,00:17:48.484,"Some sensational story in the papers, making these boys out to be superheroes triumphing over evil."
00:17:48.984,00:17:50.903,Let me squash the rumors now.
00:17:51.987,00:17:54.531,These two are not heroes.
00:17:56.325,00:18:04.833,They're just two ordinary men who were put in an extraordinary situation and they just happened to come out on top.
00:18:05.417,00:18:10.881,"Yes, nothing from our far-reaching computer system has turned up diddly on these two."
00:18:10.964,00:18:13.425,All we know is what we found out from the neighbors.
00:18:13.509,00:18:20.057,And the general consensus is… they're angels.
00:18:22.851,00:18:24.269,But angels don't kill.
00:18:25.687,00:18:37.574,And we got two bodies in the morgue that look like they've been serial-crushed Are we considering these guys armed and dangerous?
00:18:37.658,00:18:39.076,"Well, not armed."
00:18:39.743,00:18:43.288,"If they had guns, they would've used them. But dangerous? Very."
00:18:43.372,00:18:45.249,"Now, what makes you think they're dangerous?"
00:18:52.506,00:18:56.051,"Hey, look, I, I, I'm not saying one way or the other."
00:18:56.135,00:18:59.179,Just be careful and go by the protocol on this.
00:18:59.721,00:19:01.932,It's grunt police work that's gonna bring this one in.
00:19:04.393,00:19:06.436,These guys are miles away by now.
00:19:06.520,00:19:09.940,"But if you wanna beat your head against the wall, then here's what you're looking for."
00:19:10.023,00:19:12.192,They're scared like two little bunny rabbits.
00:19:12.276,00:19:16.196,Anything in a uniform or flashing blue lights is gonna spook 'em. Okay?
00:19:16.280,00:19:21.201,So the only thing we can do is put a potato on a string and drag it through South Boston.
00:19:24.413,00:19:26.623,You'd probably have better luck with a beer.
00:19:27.499,00:19:28.709,You would.
00:19:29.835,00:19:31.170,"Oh, fuck."
00:19:33.046,00:19:35.132,"Onion bagel, cream cheese."
00:19:48.979,00:19:51.148,This conversation is going to be recorded.
00:19:51.732,00:19:54.484,Just answer to the best of your knowledge.
00:19:54.568,00:19:56.028,"Excuse me, sir. Please."
00:19:59.364,00:20:02.993,What do we tell him about the guns and money?
00:20:04.244,00:20:05.829,We just got up and left.
00:20:06.496,00:20:08.624,Bum musta rolled them before the police got there.
00:20:12.753,00:20:16.506,You boys are not under oath here. Just answer the questions.
00:20:16.590,00:20:20.928,"I'm assuming… you knew these guys from before, huh?"
00:20:27.726,00:20:29.770,They had some pretty interesting bandages.
00:20:30.604,00:20:32.022,Know anything about that?
00:20:36.109,00:20:38.612,"Listen, if you want to fight, you can see you're outnumbered here."
00:20:38.695,00:20:41.114,"We're trying to be civil, so I suggest you take our offer."
00:20:41.198,00:20:42.950,I make the offers.
00:20:43.533,00:20:45.077,"Hey, Boris."
00:20:47.246,00:20:57.339,What would you do… if I told you… your pinko commie mother sucks so much dick her face looks like an egg?
00:20:57.422,00:20:58.590,-Fuck you! -What are you doing?
00:21:04.596,00:21:06.348,"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
00:21:26.868,00:21:29.371,Stay away! He can take care of himself.
00:21:56.523,00:21:59.276,"Freeze, you fucking Irish faggots!"
00:22:01.987,00:22:04.614,-Come on! -Get your fucking hands off of me.
00:22:06.074,00:22:09.286,Cuff yourself around the back. Cuff yourself.
00:22:09.369,00:22:10.620,Cuff it.
00:22:14.166,00:22:16.626,You know why I fucking come here?
00:22:16.710,00:22:18.712,I come here to kill you.
00:22:19.504,00:22:23.383,"But now, I don't think I fucking kill you."
00:22:23.467,00:22:26.094,I kill your brother.
00:22:26.178,00:22:27.429,Shoot him in the head.
00:22:29.806,00:22:31.058,Gotta go.
00:22:31.141,00:22:32.392,Connor!
00:22:33.393,00:22:36.271,It was just a fucking bar fight! You guys are fucking pussies.
00:23:30.367,00:23:33.995,"I hope your conscience is clear, Irishman."
00:24:47.444,00:24:51.364,"So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?"
00:24:52.240,00:24:53.325,We paid attention in school.
00:24:54.075,00:24:55.660,Do you speak any other languages?
00:24:55.744,00:24:59.080,-Aye. Our mother insisted on it. -French?
00:25:02.042,00:25:03.585,without talking to us?
00:25:03.668,00:25:05.045,"Oh, that's beautiful."
00:25:06.504,00:25:09.132,Maybe someone saw and talked.
00:25:11.009,00:25:12.177,That's Italian.
00:25:12.260,00:25:13.803,"Not in our neighborhood, man."
00:25:13.887,00:25:15.931,A hundred percent Irish.
00:25:16.556,00:25:19.476,No one talks to cops. Period.
00:25:19.559,00:25:20.769,Bravo.
00:25:25.482,00:25:28.485,What are you guys doing working at a frigging meat packing plant?
00:25:32.155,00:25:33.573,"Uh, the press is everywhere."
00:25:33.657,00:25:36.368,They're just going nuts for these guys. I don't know what you wanna do.
00:25:37.160,00:25:39.913,You're not being charged. It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?
00:25:40.497,00:25:42.415,-Absolutely not. -No pictures either.
00:25:43.124,00:25:44.793,Is there any way that we could stay here?
00:25:44.876,00:25:50.131,"Uh, yeah. You know, we have an extra holding cell you guys can… Can they stay?"
00:25:53.385,00:25:55.762,But it's okay with me if your friends sleep over.
00:25:59.849,00:26:01.268,Time to feed the dogs.
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.731,"Okay, people. Okay."
00:26:07.440,00:26:09.359,This is our official statement.
00:26:10.652,00:26:13.655,The MacManus brothers are not being charged with a crime.
00:26:14.322,00:26:16.866,This is a clear-cut case of self-defense.
00:26:16.950,00:26:21.329,They are being released at an undisclosed time and location in accordance with their wishes.
00:26:21.413,00:26:25.000,-Do the MacManus brothers have any priors? -Can we speak to the MacManus brothers?
00:26:35.927,00:26:38.096,-Yeah. -Guys!
00:26:41.057,00:26:42.058,Yeah!
00:26:44.561,00:26:47.480,-Oh. Very nice. -Yeah.
00:26:53.862,00:26:58.366,They watched as he simply walked away.
00:26:58.450,00:27:01.119,Indifference a good man.
00:27:01.202,00:27:04.164,Nobody wanted to get involved.
00:27:09.210,00:27:11.629,By man shall his blood be shed.
00:27:12.505,00:27:16.343,For in the image of God may deem a man.
00:27:17.677,00:27:19.554,Destroy all that which is evil.
00:27:19.637,00:27:22.182,So that which is good may flourish.
00:27:57.092,00:27:58.343,What the fuck is that?
00:28:18.196,00:28:20.407,"-Good morning, boys! How are ya? -Hey."
00:28:20.490,00:28:22.867,"-Keep the faith, man. -Fucking blow me."
00:28:22.951,00:28:26.413,-What was that? Have you got a pen? -Yeah. Here you go.
00:28:26.496,00:28:28.790,"-Thanks, bro. Be right back. -Good morning, son. How are ya?"
00:28:28.873,00:28:31.668,-Morning. -We'd be honored if you would join us.
00:28:34.921,00:28:36.172,-See this? -Donuts.
00:28:39.134,00:28:40.176,Saints?
00:28:53.398,00:28:59.154,"Be at the presidential suite room 701, Copley Plaza Hotel, 9:00 p.m. Sharp."
00:29:04.909,00:29:06.035,Amen.
00:29:11.708,00:29:14.753,"That's not funny, man. Give it here, package boy."
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.922,Joey Beevo said it was important. Said to give it to him myself.
00:29:18.006,00:29:19.424,Give me the fucking thing.
00:29:22.719,00:29:24.137,Sit the fuck down.
00:29:36.232,00:29:39.611,"So, I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man."
00:29:42.614,00:29:44.532,I'm so fucking funny.
00:29:44.616,00:29:46.993,"-Fuck you, Vincenzo. -Uh-huh."
00:29:47.535,00:29:49.454,How did you get that shiner on your eye?
00:29:49.537,00:29:51.998,What's the matter? Someone didn't think you were very funny?
00:29:56.336,00:29:58.505,I caught your show at the Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.
00:29:58.588,00:30:01.382,Loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
00:30:01.466,00:30:02.801,"-Hey, hey, hey. -Whoa!"
00:30:05.470,00:30:08.097,It's not my feelings that the… is rotting.
00:30:08.181,00:30:12.310,It's a plank of… You insignificant cunt. Little fuck.
00:30:12.393,00:30:16.523,"I always get my money, you cocksucking bastardo."
00:30:23.196,00:30:25.073,The '90s are killing me.
00:30:25.156,00:30:26.866,I shouldn't have done that.
00:30:26.950,00:30:29.702,You're not supposed to tell a guy you're gonna kill him no more.
00:30:29.786,00:30:33.081,I gotta tiptoe through the tulips with these assholes.
00:30:33.665,00:30:36.709,Taking all the fun out of the job.
00:30:42.590,00:30:44.008,"Pappa Joe, you want me to go now?"
00:30:47.178,00:30:50.348,All the boys tell me how you make them laugh when you come around.
00:30:50.431,00:30:53.226,What a crackup you are. What do they call you?
00:31:00.817,00:31:03.069,I'm having a shitty day. I'm depressed.
00:31:03.570,00:31:04.779,Tell me a funny joke.
00:31:06.197,00:31:07.240,Now?
00:31:08.950,00:31:13.538,"A joke? Uh… Um, uh, a joke. Yeah, all right."
00:31:13.621,00:31:22.505,"Um, there's these, uh, three guys, uh… A, a, a spic… A, a, a white guy and a black guy."
00:31:22.589,00:31:25.174,-Nigger. -Yeah.
00:31:25.258,00:31:27.635,Yeah. And they're walking along the beach.
00:31:27.719,00:31:30.388,"They see this pot. They rub it, a genie comes out."
00:31:30.471,00:31:32.223,Genie says you can wish for anything you want.
00:31:32.307,00:31:42.609,"So he asks the Mexican what he wants. And he goes, uh… Uh… I want, uh, all my people in America to be happy and free in Mexico."
00:31:42.692,00:31:46.571,And so genie… Poof. And all the spics are in Mexico.
00:31:47.155,00:31:49.574,-And then he asks the black guy… -Nigger.
00:31:50.658,00:31:52.076,"Yeah, that's what I said."
00:31:52.160,00:31:54.913,"He goes to the nigger, says, What do you want?"
00:31:54.996,00:32:04.923,"And he goes, um… Uh, I want all my… African… my nigger brothers in America to be back in Africa and, and happy and everything."
00:32:05.423,00:32:07.425,"You know, so the genie goes poof."
00:32:07.508,00:32:11.763,"And, um, all the niggers in America are in Africa."
00:32:12.263,00:32:15.683,"And uh, uh, uh… This is going… I'm not funny today."
00:32:15.767,00:32:19.270,I know. I'm having a hard day. I… I… This joke sucks.
00:32:19.354,00:32:21.397,It's just a stupid joke.
00:32:25.318,00:32:26.569,Continue the joke.
00:32:31.741,00:32:36.913,"So the genie says to the white guy, uh, um, What's your one wish?"
00:32:36.996,00:32:41.542,"And the white guy goes, You mean to tell me all the niggers and spics are out of America?"
00:32:41.626,00:32:45.672,"The genie goes, Yeah. He says, Well, um… I'll have a Coke then."
00:33:08.319,00:33:10.405,-I'll have a Coke. -Yea.
00:33:10.488,00:33:16.285,"Yeah. Everybody's out, so he just wants a Coke, 'cause that's all he needs."
00:33:19.831,00:33:22.125,-Tell me one more. -What?
00:33:41.519,00:33:42.812,Knock yourselves out.
00:34:07.712,00:34:09.589,Fucking hell.
00:34:24.604,00:34:28.816,"-Do you know what we need, man? Some rope. -Absolutely."
00:34:28.900,00:34:31.110,"-What are you, insane? -No, it's not insane."
00:34:31.194,00:34:33.446,Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
00:34:33.529,00:34:35.281,-What? -Yeah.
00:34:35.364,00:34:38.868,"He's got a lot of rope strapped around him in the movies, and they always end up using it."
00:34:38.951,00:34:41.871,"-You've lost it, haven't you? -No, I'm serious."
00:34:42.955,00:34:45.291,You know that's stupid. Name one thing you'd need a rope for.
00:34:45.374,00:34:47.376,You don't fucking know what you're gonna need it for.
00:34:47.460,00:34:48.878,They just always need it.
00:34:50.505,00:34:53.257,What's this they shit? This isn't a movie.
00:34:56.385,00:34:58.930,Oh. Right.
00:35:04.977,00:35:06.604,"Isn't that right, Rambo?"
00:35:11.025,00:35:13.444,All right. Get your stupid fucking rope.
00:35:14.946,00:35:17.782,I'll get my stupid rope. I'll get it.
00:35:20.326,00:35:21.327,There's rope right there.
00:35:56.612,00:35:57.613,You nervous?
00:35:59.866,00:36:02.410,-A bit. -Myself as well.
00:36:20.261,00:36:21.804,Uh-huh. Room number?
00:36:23.764,00:36:25.141,Have we got a time of death?
00:36:36.777,00:36:38.196,"All right, keep the press out."
00:36:39.447,00:36:41.616,-What are you doing? -I just wanted to cuddle.
00:36:56.297,00:36:57.131,Ooh.
00:36:58.049,00:37:00.343,This is a fucking slaughterhouse.
00:37:09.727,00:37:11.979,"-How many bodies, Greenly? -Eight."
00:37:13.147,00:37:16.525,"Aw, shit. I forgot about that one. Nine. Nine?"
00:37:16.609,00:37:20.071,"While Greenly's out getting coffee, anybody else want anything?"
00:37:20.154,00:37:21.572,Shit.
00:37:25.660,00:37:28.579,you got any theories to go with that tie?
00:37:30.706,00:37:33.834,"Look, fuck all these other guys."
00:37:33.918,00:37:36.796,"This was their target, the fag man."
00:37:36.879,00:37:37.880,The what man?
00:37:40.299,00:37:41.509,The fat man.
00:37:42.635,00:37:44.804,"Well, Freud was right."
00:37:45.554,00:37:48.808,"So you think they came for the fag man, huh?"
00:37:48.891,00:37:50.851,What do you base this upon?
00:37:50.935,00:37:54.188,He was the only one done right. Double tap back of the head.
00:37:57.358,00:37:58.818,That's a possibility.
00:37:59.777,00:38:02.446,Now you Irish cops are perking up.
00:38:02.989,00:38:07.159,That's two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally-sized men.
00:38:08.035,00:38:10.079,Kind of makes me feel like Riverdancing.
00:38:15.209,00:38:19.297,Another possibility is they were placed there with religious intent.
00:38:19.839,00:38:23.926,"Okay, some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead. Or silver."
00:38:27.763,00:38:30.808,"So, what's the symbology there?"
00:38:31.642,00:38:32.685,The symbology?
00:38:34.478,00:38:39.025,"Now that Duffy has relinquished his King Bonehead crown, I see we have an heir to the thrown."
00:38:39.108,00:38:41.569,I'm sure the word you were looking for was symbolism.
00:38:41.652,00:38:44.447,What is the symbolism there?
00:38:44.989,00:38:46.532,"Uh, let me explain it to you."
00:38:48.409,00:38:57.168,"In Greek and Roman mythology, when you died, you'd have to pay the toll to Charon, the boatman who ferried you across to the Gates of Judgment."
00:38:57.251,00:39:02.757,"This made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives, Detective Alapopskalius."
00:39:02.840,00:39:05.134,Jesus. You're the first one that ever got that.
00:39:05.217,00:39:09.180,"Yeah, well, I'm an expert in nameology."
00:39:12.475,00:39:15.895,These burns indicate that they used silencers.
00:39:17.271,00:39:19.231,Look at these entry and exit wounds.
00:39:20.191,00:39:21.650,They're almost identical.
00:39:23.819,00:39:29.909,"The two bullets went in here through the top of the skull crisscrossed, and exited through the eyeballs."
00:39:29.992,00:39:32.870,This one clue tells us three distinct facts.
00:39:32.953,00:39:36.123,-Number one. Duffy? -They shot him at a downward angle.
00:39:37.541,00:39:40.628,-They put him on his knees? -Excellent. Number two. Greenly.
00:39:41.545,00:39:43.964,They shot him at a downward angle?
00:39:48.844,00:39:51.097,It tells us he was the last to die.
00:39:52.973,00:39:56.936,-And number three. Dolly. -Uh… There was two shooters.
00:39:57.019,00:39:59.647,"-Fan-freaking-tastic. -Hey, wait a minute."
00:39:59.730,00:40:01.273,"Stay with me, boys."
00:40:01.357,00:40:04.276,What did they do to make two such identical wounds?
00:40:04.860,00:40:07.363,Two men of similar height dropped this guy down.
00:40:07.446,00:40:11.200,Each puts some iron to his head and boom. That's all she fricking wrote.
00:40:11.283,00:40:14.954,"-What about one guy, two guns? -Ah, possible."
00:40:15.037,00:40:17.706,But unlikely. The angles are too extreme.
00:40:17.790,00:40:21.168,A guy holding two guns to the back of your noodle is gonna shoot straight ahead.
00:40:21.252,00:40:23.254,He wouldn't cock out his elbows. It makes no sense.
00:40:23.337,00:40:31.804,"Besides, are you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well-aimed shots in just a few seconds?"
00:40:31.887,00:40:34.223,No way. It had to be at least two.
00:41:19.894,00:41:20.853,Fuck.
00:41:54.220,00:41:58.098,Fuck you. I'm sweating my ass off dragging your fucking rope around.
00:42:00.434,00:42:03.521,"We are doing some serious shit here. Now, get a fucking hold of yourself."
00:42:03.604,00:42:09.568,"Oh, fuck you. I'm not the rope-toting Charlie Bronson wannabe -that's getting us fucking lost. -Would you fucking shut it?"
00:42:12.029,00:43:02.204,You mother… Power hath descended forth from Thy hand.
00:43:02.288,00:43:04.748,Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.
00:43:04.832,00:43:08.627,"So we shall flow a river forth to Thee, and teeming with souls shall it ever be."
00:43:53.005,00:43:56.759,And you shall have the protection of all the angels in heaven.
00:43:59.803,00:44:01.138,Television.
00:44:03.974,00:44:06.310,Television is the explanation for this.
00:44:06.393,00:44:08.854,You see this in bad television.
00:44:10.439,00:44:13.859,"The little assault guys creeping through the vents, coming in through the ceiling."
00:44:13.942,00:44:16.278,That James Bond shit never happens in real life.
00:44:16.362,00:44:17.780,Professionals don't do that.
00:44:19.406,00:44:24.286,"Well, name one thing you're gonna need this stupid fucking rope for."
00:44:25.120,00:44:26.997,-That was way easier than I thought. -Aye.
00:44:27.498,00:44:30.125,"You know, on TV, you've always got that guy that jumps over the sofa."
00:44:30.209,00:44:32.503,And then you've gotta shoot him for ten fucking minutes too.
00:44:32.586,00:44:33.504,Aye.
00:44:34.046,00:44:37.383,"-Christ. We're good. -Yes, we are."
00:44:38.342,00:44:41.929,"Now, what do you think is in that little case there?"
00:44:48.310,00:44:49.353,Fuck me.
00:44:50.646,00:44:53.440,Oh. The hits just keep on coming.
00:44:53.524,00:44:56.068,Ow. Give it a smell.
00:45:17.423,00:45:19.633,-This has got to be his big break. -Yeah.
00:45:20.926,00:45:23.971,"-We've got to fuck with him, right? -Oh."
00:45:24.888,00:45:25.931,-Okay. -Okay.
00:45:43.907,00:45:46.869,"Boss must've sent me in as backup, huh. I'm Rocco."
00:45:49.830,00:45:52.249,-Where's your gun? -I'm the fucking funny man.
00:45:52.332,00:45:53.917,It's right here. Right here.
00:46:06.972,00:46:11.894,"What the fuck were you gonna do, laugh the last three to death, funny man?"
00:46:17.065,00:46:19.276,"Boy, you guys sure did a good job."
00:46:19.902,00:46:21.987,"Ah, shit. You guys are good, huh?"
00:46:22.613,00:46:23.989,Cool masks. Where'd you get 'em?
00:46:49.389,00:46:59.066,Fucking… What the fucking… Fuck! Who the fuck… Fuck this fucking… How did you two fucking fucks… Fuck!
00:46:59.691,00:47:03.028,"Well, that certainly illustrates the diversity of the word."
00:47:06.698,00:47:08.450,All these guys are Russian mob.
00:47:10.244,00:47:13.205,But not like those two peons in the alley the other day.
00:47:13.288,00:47:16.208,These guys are all syndicate bosses and underbosses.
00:47:16.291,00:47:18.585,I have a dossier on every man in this room.
00:47:21.088,00:47:26.301,Since the Iron Curtain has gone down… the Russian syndicates have started to come here.
00:47:26.385,00:47:30.639,"And in the spirit of Glasnost, the Soviets have opened their borders to the Mafia."
00:47:30.722,00:47:33.684,"But the Italians, they aren't convinced."
00:47:33.767,00:47:37.104,The grounds in Mother Russia are fertile enough for organized crime yet.
00:47:37.187,00:47:41.942,So they ain't ready to commit. But the Russians are coming here anyway.
00:47:42.609,00:47:43.944,They are unwelcome.
00:47:45.237,00:47:54.413,"So, what we have here, gentlemen, is possibly the beginning of the first international mob war."
00:47:55.831,00:47:59.126,Unless I've totally missed something.
00:47:59.209,00:48:06.425,Live from the Copley Plaza Hotel where we have just been informed that the largest multiple murder in Boston's history has just taken place.
00:48:06.508,00:48:13.515,We have learned that there were nine victims all deeply involved in a notoriously violent Russian crime syndicate right here in Boston.
00:48:14.182,00:48:16.768,Anybody you think is evil?
00:48:16.852,00:48:18.061,Aye.
00:48:19.146,00:48:22.232,"Don't you think that's a little weird, a little psycho?"
00:48:22.816,00:48:24.443,"Do you know what I think is psycho, Roc?"
00:48:29.114,00:48:31.283,It's decent men with loving families.
00:48:31.366,00:48:34.244,They go home every day after work and they turn on the news.
00:48:34.328,00:48:35.537,You know what they see?
00:48:35.621,00:48:38.749,They see rapists and murderers and child molesters.
00:48:39.249,00:48:41.126,They're all getting out of prison.
00:48:44.379,00:48:49.635,"Getting caught with 20 kilos, getting out on bail the same fucking day."
00:48:49.718,00:48:52.554,"And everywhere, everyone thinks the same thing."
00:48:53.388,00:48:56.808,That someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
00:48:57.476,00:49:00.354,Kill 'em all. Admit it.
00:49:01.313,00:49:02.689,Even you've thought about it.
00:49:06.902,00:49:08.695,You guys should be in every major city.
00:49:10.530,00:49:11.490,This is some heavy shit.
00:49:12.741,00:49:15.369,"This is like Lone Ranger heavy, man."
00:49:17.079,00:49:17.913,Fuck it!
00:49:17.996,00:49:20.540,There's so much shit that pisses me off.
00:49:22.167,00:49:32.010,"You guys should recruit, 'cause I'm sick and fucking tired of walking down the street waiting for one of these crack-piping, ass-wiping, motherless lowlifes to get me."
00:49:32.094,00:49:33.387,"Hallelujah, Jaffar."
00:49:34.346,00:49:35.972,"So you're not just talking about mob guys, right?"
00:49:36.056,00:49:39.017,"You're talking about pimps and drug dealers and all that shit, right?"
00:49:42.896,00:49:46.149,Fuck. You guys could do this every goddamn day.
00:49:46.942,00:49:48.276,We're sort of like 7-Eleven.
00:49:49.069,00:49:52.572,We're not always doing business but we're always open.
00:49:52.656,00:49:56.243,-Mmm. That is nicely put. -Thank you very much.
00:50:06.128,00:50:07.879,"I will fuck you up, dude."
00:50:15.220,00:50:17.431,So then we go right through the fucking ceiling like this.
00:50:26.732,00:50:27.899,"Oh, boy."
00:50:28.567,00:50:30.068,You fucking guys.
00:50:30.777,00:50:31.987,You ruined me.
00:50:32.779,00:50:34.364,I'm fucking done.
00:50:34.906,00:50:37.242,Permanent fucking package boy.
00:50:38.076,00:50:39.161,Who said that?
00:50:40.370,00:50:42.122,"You can take credit on that, you know?"
00:50:42.205,00:50:43.707,"What, are you serious?"
00:50:44.583,00:50:46.501,Yeah. Fuck it.
00:50:48.044,00:50:50.380,"If you think about it, it's all you can do, really."
00:50:50.964,00:50:53.008,"I mean, you can't go in there and tell him it was us."
00:50:53.633,00:50:55.093,"Climb the corporate ladder, boy."
00:50:58.889,00:50:59.973,Fuck it.
00:51:00.599,00:51:02.517,I'm doing it. I deserve it.
00:51:02.601,00:51:05.604,I've been working for those fat bastards since I've been in high school.
00:51:05.687,00:51:08.815,"Look at this fucking place. They're fucking me, man."
00:51:08.899,00:51:13.069,They can suck my pathetic little dick.
00:51:13.153,00:51:19.326,And I'll dip my nuts in marinara sauce just so the fat bastards can get a taste of home while they're at it.
00:51:19.409,00:51:21.870,Fuck it! I'm doing it.
00:51:21.953,00:51:23.371,It is done!
00:51:24.164,00:51:27.918,"-Shit! Oh, shit! Shit! -Oh, my god! Shit!"
00:51:31.296,00:51:33.340,-What the fuck? -I'm hit!
00:51:33.423,00:51:34.508,"-Oh, fuck! -I'm hit!"
00:51:40.055,00:51:42.265,I can't believe that just fucking happened!
00:51:43.225,00:51:45.560,"-Is it dead? -Oh, my god!"
00:52:08.917,00:52:11.211,-Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. -Shit.
00:52:15.048,00:52:17.801,She'd have sold the thing for a dime bag. Screw her.
00:52:21.847,00:52:24.182,"I do kind of feel like an asshole, though."
00:52:24.266,00:52:25.934,"Yeah, Roc, you sound real remorseful there."
00:52:31.356,00:52:33.733,"Listen, something's been bothering me about last night."
00:52:33.817,00:52:34.693,What?
00:52:36.695,00:52:39.531,What if your boss knew how many fellows were supposed to be there?
00:52:39.614,00:52:42.659,-What are you… What are you saying? -Think about it.
00:52:42.742,00:52:45.036,"Nine men, six bullets."
00:52:45.620,00:52:47.664,Think they sold me out? No way. No way.
00:52:48.373,00:52:52.836,"Listen, he probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there."
00:52:53.753,00:52:55.338,Figure it out. The shooter's dead at the scene.
00:52:55.422,00:52:56.756,There's no in-depth investigation.
00:52:56.840,00:52:58.592,They'll just slide right off his fucking back.
00:52:59.843,00:53:00.886,'Cause what the fuck?
00:53:01.595,00:53:05.265,"As much as I love you, man, you are not exactly Don Corleone."
00:53:07.183,00:53:14.274,"That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how does he know… I just don't get in there, see there's too many of 'em, serve 'em their fucking food… Because he fucking knows you, Roc."
00:53:14.357,00:53:17.652,"A smooth hitter would have gone in there, seen it was a fucking wash and slipped out."
00:53:18.153,00:53:20.405,"But you, he knows this is your only shot."
00:53:21.031,00:53:22.824,You've been waiting 18 fucking years.
00:53:26.161,00:53:28.872,"That just ain't the way… No, that's bull… That's bullshit."
00:53:28.955,00:53:32.000,You don't know what you're talking about. That's just not the way things happen.
00:53:32.083,00:53:35.795,"It's, uh… I mean, thanks for your concern and all -but that just ain't the thing of it. -Yeah."
00:53:35.879,00:53:38.423,"Do me a favor, all right? Just roll it around a bit on your way in."
00:53:38.506,00:53:40.091,"-Will you for me? -No, no, no. No rolling."
00:53:40.175,00:53:41.468,Nothing needs to be rolled.
00:53:42.010,00:53:42.844,Fuck.
00:53:42.928,00:53:44.846,Where the fuck are you going? Did you tell him?
00:53:44.930,00:53:46.264,Of course I fucking told him.
00:53:46.348,00:53:49.809,-Then what the fuck? -You guys don't know that shit for sure!
00:53:49.893,00:53:52.812,"-Oh, you're such a fucking retard! -Hey, fuck you!"
00:53:52.896,00:53:55.315,"Oh, man, use your fucking brain for once!"
00:53:55.398,00:53:58.568,Is it so unbelievable that they don't fucking care about ya?
00:53:58.652,00:54:01.029,"Oh, yeah, you two fucking micks know what's going on, huh?"
00:54:01.112,00:54:01.988,Fuck you both!
00:54:02.072,00:54:04.366,"This is not a fucking thing you should gamble on, all right?"
00:54:06.284,00:54:07.577,I'm gonna fuck out of here.
00:54:08.244,00:54:10.622,Fine! Fuck it!
00:54:10.705,00:54:13.416,"What kind of flowers you want at your funeral, you dumb wop?"
00:54:13.500,00:54:15.001,It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!
00:54:15.085,00:54:17.629,I'll be back at 9:00. Bury the fucking cat!
00:54:17.712,00:54:21.841,"Listen, you get in there and you start getting a bad vibe, you get the fuck out quick!"
00:54:35.313,00:54:36.898,Anybody call for me?
00:54:38.024,00:54:40.151,"No, man. Are you sure you're okay?"
00:54:40.235,00:54:41.736,I'm fucking fine.
00:55:13.059,00:55:16.062,Pack your shit! Pack your shit! We gotta get out of here!
00:55:16.146,00:55:19.232,-We gotta get out! -What the fuck are you talking about?
00:55:19.315,00:55:21.693,"I killed them. Oh, Jesus, I killed them all."
00:55:21.776,00:55:24.029,-Just calm down. Tell us what happened. -No.
00:55:26.448,00:55:29.951,"No! Fuck you! You start getting excited, motherfucker!"
00:55:34.539,00:55:37.000,"-Well, how many were there? -Fucking hurry the fuck up!"
00:55:39.502,00:55:41.504,All right! I love this shit.
00:55:41.588,00:55:45.467,"-What the fuck is wrong with you, Roc? -The cocksucker sold me out!"
00:55:45.550,00:55:47.761,"Didn't I tell you, Roc? Did they pull on you first?"
00:55:47.844,00:55:50.430,What am I doing? In the middle of the Lakeview.
00:55:50.513,00:55:52.432,"Lakeview the deli, Roc?"
00:55:52.515,00:55:54.768,Looks like we got us a new fucking recruit.
00:55:59.022,00:55:59.981,Where's my cat?
00:56:02.400,00:56:05.361,"I killed your cat, you druggie bitch."
00:56:05.445,00:56:06.863,-God. Why? -What?
00:56:06.946,00:56:09.616,I felt it would bring closure to our relationship.
00:56:09.699,00:56:12.660,-You killed my… My… -Your what?
00:56:12.744,00:56:17.749,"-My… -Your fucking what? Huh? Your what, bitch?"
00:56:17.832,00:56:22.295,"I'll shoot myself in the head, if you can tell me that cat's name."
00:56:22.378,00:56:29.844,"Go ahead. Your what? Your precious little… -Skippy. Skippy. -Oh, Jesus. What color was it, bitch?"
00:56:29.928,00:56:32.138,"Don't you fucking yell at her like that, you prick."
00:56:32.722,00:56:35.558,"Shut your fat ass, Rayvie."
00:56:35.642,00:56:40.772,I can't buy a pack of smokes without running into nine guys you fucked!
00:56:40.855,00:56:43.733,Damn. Son of a bitch.
00:56:47.987,00:56:51.074,"Those rat fucks. All of them were all laughing at me, man."
00:56:51.157,00:56:52.534,"Are you sure you killed them, Roc?"
00:56:52.617,00:56:55.829,Fucking-A right I did. I had a goddamn turkey shoot over there.
00:56:55.912,00:56:57.497,Anybody call for me?
00:57:00.166,00:57:01.543,I'm fucking fine.
00:57:03.461,00:57:05.338,I'll catch you on the flip side.
00:57:44.961,00:57:46.671,I'll bet it was a fucking test.
00:57:47.422,00:57:50.133,Vincenzo came in here shooting his mouth off.
00:57:50.842,00:57:52.552,He made sure we knew.
00:57:56.055,00:57:57.891,"But we did what we were supposed to, huh?"
00:57:58.850,00:58:00.351,We kept our mouths shut.
00:58:09.152,00:58:11.070,They know we're goodfellas now.
00:58:12.280,00:58:13.823,"We'll get taken care of, baby."
00:58:14.657,00:58:16.034,What? Did everyone know?
00:58:16.618,00:58:18.495,Next thing you're gonna tell me Sal was in on it.
00:58:19.120,00:58:22.582,Vincenzo told Sal first. That fat fuck knew before we did.
00:58:24.417,00:58:26.252,"At least we got our funny man back, huh?"
00:58:38.848,00:58:40.642,"That was funny, wasn't it?"
00:58:40.725,00:58:43.603,"-That was real fucking funny! -No, not me! Not me!"
00:58:43.686,00:58:45.063,Huh? Ha!
00:58:45.146,00:58:49.400,Fun… Funny! Funny! Funny!
00:58:57.492,00:58:59.494,"Listen, Roc, did anybody see ya?"
00:58:59.577,00:59:03.164,"Fuck, man, I might as well have gone around posting flyers."
00:59:07.043,00:59:08.711,"Liberating, isn't it?"
00:59:08.795,00:59:11.965,"-Let's fucking go! -You know, it is a bit."
00:59:19.764,00:59:22.725,"Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand."
00:59:22.809,00:59:27.188,"He's the one who set me up, then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everybody I was as good as dead."
00:59:27.272,00:59:31.776,"Goes in there every Wednesday night, ten o'clock, jerks off on the same titty dancer. Never misses."
00:59:31.859,00:59:34.779,"-Yeah, so? -So? So let's kill the motherfucker."
00:59:34.862,00:59:37.532,"I mean, what are you, guys? That's your new thing, right?"
00:59:38.116,00:59:40.201,"-Yeah, well… -Ah, what the fuck!"
00:59:40.285,00:59:42.495,"I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something?"
00:59:43.204,00:59:46.541,"To tell you the truth, those first ones, they just sort of fell onto our laps."
00:59:46.624,00:59:47.625,"Well, what do you do?"
00:59:48.543,00:59:56.259,"We haven't really got a system of deciding who, Roc. It's, uh… Me! Me! I'm the guy."
00:59:56.342,01:00:00.013,"I know everyone, their habits, who they hang out with, who they talk to."
01:00:00.096,01:00:03.057,"I got phone numbers, addresses. I know who they're fucking!"
01:00:03.141,01:00:04.475,I know where they live!
01:00:05.560,01:00:07.228,We could kill everyone.
01:00:09.314,01:00:10.982,So what do you think?
01:00:56.486,01:00:58.529,What? You guys got masks.
01:01:02.867,01:01:04.911,"When we're through, she can ID me."
01:01:04.994,01:01:08.331,"I don't care. Just trying to be professional, but no."
01:01:10.124,01:01:14.796,"No, shut the fuck up. You look good. Put it on. You look fucking scary, man."
01:01:18.675,01:01:23.012,"Now, Roc, are you sure that you're O-B-kay-B?"
01:01:40.071,01:01:42.281,-Can she ID 'em? -No.
01:01:47.912,01:01:50.957,And don't make like you don't know who the fuck I'm talking about!
01:01:52.709,01:01:56.421,"Don't you talk to me like that, you dirty little girl."
01:02:02.385,01:02:04.429,-How many? -Three.
01:02:04.971,01:02:06.597,Two of them did the shooting.
01:02:09.142,01:02:12.854,"In nomine Patris, et fillii, et Spiritus Sancti."
01:02:12.937,01:02:16.357,Our little theory from last night just got shot to shit.
01:02:17.984,01:02:19.485,Something new is going on here.
01:02:28.870,01:02:33.332,"After talking to the dancer, we know their mark was the guy in the middle booth."
01:02:34.709,01:02:38.504,"After she watches 'em whack him, she passes out."
01:03:01.319,01:03:03.613,-What the fuck are you doing? -I'll tip her.
01:03:05.156,01:03:06.949,Why are there two extra victims?
01:03:14.248,01:03:24.175,"Allow me to enlighten you, gentlemen… to the protocol of the porno industry as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before."
01:03:24.801,01:03:30.807,"A man goes into the booth, puts the money through the slot, the dancer gets it on the other side."
01:03:30.890,01:03:32.558,"She hits the button, the door goes up."
01:03:32.642,01:03:36.437,"Now there's only glass between you, and that's, uh, little fireman time."
01:03:37.104,01:03:38.689,No way they could have seen it.
01:03:39.357,01:03:41.943,"Those doors were down, so that means this."
01:03:42.860,01:03:51.786,"They looked in, down through the peepholes saw these guys, opened the doors from the inside… Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass."
01:03:52.745,01:03:53.871,Why?
01:04:02.213,01:04:03.798,It's like a scumbag yard sale.
01:04:03.881,01:04:05.883,We should come down here once a week and clean house.
01:04:07.218,01:04:09.679,Maybe the three guys had something in common.
01:04:10.263,01:04:13.349,"No, this guy's big time. These two are street-walking scum."
01:04:14.058,01:04:16.477,"Then that's what they had in common, they're all bad guys."
01:04:16.561,01:04:18.271,Now they're all dead bad guys.
01:04:20.106,01:04:22.233,"Oh, man, you gotta let me do these guys."
01:04:22.316,01:04:24.652,I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for that tit thing.
01:04:24.735,01:04:26.696,There's no way. I've been waiting for this asshole.
01:04:28.906,01:04:30.658,"Come on, man. Give the guy his shot."
01:04:31.617,01:04:35.913,"It's the real deal, Roc. Evil men, dead men."
01:04:39.000,01:04:42.587,Good shooting… Shitty shooting.
01:04:55.474,01:05:01.439,"Plus, we got us a genuine Kennedy assassination-style bullet theory here."
01:05:01.522,01:05:02.607,Two guns were used.
01:05:02.690,01:05:06.068,The guy in the middle was done with both of 'em.
01:05:06.152,01:05:21.167,"But this guy, he was killed with bullets from gun A only and this guy, gun B only. But… ballistics dug two slugs out of the wall from B over here where the victim was done with A."
01:05:21.792,01:05:23.711,And it's the same thing over here.
01:05:28.507,01:05:29.717,Why the crossover?
01:05:31.260,01:05:33.721,That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
01:05:34.847,01:05:36.599,"Jesus, I just can't think anymore."
01:05:36.682,01:05:40.144,That scene over at the coffee shop today just tapped me out.
01:05:40.728,01:05:42.063,What scene?
01:05:42.146,01:05:44.774,"Uh, some guy went nuts over off of Com Ave."
01:05:44.857,01:05:48.361,"Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop, broad daylight, fled the scene."
01:05:49.153,01:05:51.530,-Don't have much on him. -Why wasn't I informed of this?
01:05:51.614,01:05:53.741,They weren't related. The guy used a.38.
01:05:53.824,01:05:56.452,"-No pennies, totally amateur. -Who were the victims?"
01:05:56.535,01:05:58.704,A couple of mob peons and a fat fuck bartender.
01:05:58.788,01:06:00.957,"Oh, isn't that beautiful?"
01:06:01.040,01:06:06.295,"All the lowlifes in quiet city Boston start dropping dead, and you think it's unrelated!"
01:06:06.379,01:06:11.592,"Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police to do my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe!"
01:06:11.676,01:06:13.427,Now get me a squad car and get me over there!
01:06:14.303,01:06:17.473,I want crime scene photos and any witness statements now.
01:06:37.535,01:06:39.412,Wyatt fucking Earp!
01:06:41.664,01:06:45.334,It looks like we got us a cowboy. Hmm.
01:06:48.838,01:06:56.137,"and teeming with souls shall it ever be.  In nomine Patris, et fillii, et Spiritus Sancti."
01:06:57.722,01:07:00.558,"Hey, hey, man. You guys gotta teach me that prayer."
01:07:00.641,01:07:03.853,"-That's some good shit, man. -Cool it, Roc. It's a family prayer."
01:07:03.936,01:07:05.855,My father's father before him. So that's our shit.
01:07:06.605,01:07:07.648,"Oh, come on."
01:07:10.818,01:07:20.619,"These murders, coupled with the three suspected mob-related killings that occurred at this local Boston deli earlier this afternoon brings the death toll to six, just today."
01:07:20.703,01:07:23.581,There is no doubt that all the victims have been criminals.
01:07:23.664,01:07:29.045,Perhaps this explains why a public outcry to have these crimes stopped has not been heard.
01:07:29.628,01:07:32.173,"Ah, these two crime scenes are related."
01:07:33.132,01:07:35.342,Too many coincidences.
01:07:35.426,01:07:39.513,"Same day, five hours apart, dead mobsters in both scenes."
01:07:40.014,01:07:44.268,Now… Why did he kill the bartender?
01:07:45.644,01:07:47.563,Crime of passion. Just went nuts.
01:07:48.606,01:07:50.024,He shot everyone in here.
01:07:51.233,01:07:52.276,Just ran out of bullets.
01:07:52.818,01:07:54.820,Does this look like a frigging post office to you?
01:07:54.904,01:07:56.739,This guy came in here with intent.
01:07:56.822,01:08:02.203,"Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. No, the bartender was no fucking accident."
01:08:02.286,01:08:04.497,"Well, we didn't need any help on that."
01:08:04.580,01:08:07.541,A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
01:08:08.876,01:08:10.127,Figures.
01:08:11.128,01:08:12.296,"Oh, look."
01:08:13.464,01:08:15.633,Are you guys seeing the pattern here?
01:08:18.677,01:08:22.723,We got big questions at both of these crime scenes with no answers.
01:08:23.557,01:08:26.435,Why did they kill the guys in the other two booths?
01:08:27.144,01:08:29.021,Why did they do the bartender?
01:08:33.025,01:08:34.276,Fuck!
01:08:35.528,01:08:36.821,I hate cold crime scenes.
01:08:38.739,01:08:39.740,I'm fucking leaving now.
01:08:43.661,01:08:44.620,And do me a favor.
01:08:44.703,01:08:48.499,"Tell me when the next one dies, 'cause these guys are not done yet."
01:09:18.404,01:09:21.157,"Augustus, I need your help."
01:09:21.240,01:09:25.536,I have a serious problem. I am not screwing around here.
01:09:28.747,01:09:30.958,I need… Il Duce.
01:09:52.813,01:09:53.939,What did you do?
01:09:54.523,01:09:57.651,"Rocco, this package boy."
01:09:58.444,01:10:00.362,He could bring down the whole East Coast.
01:10:00.446,01:10:06.410,"If he decides to turn state's evidence, he could take us apart brick by brick."
01:10:06.994,01:10:08.287,But he's happy.
01:10:08.370,01:10:11.540,"Now, with just killing us one by one."
01:10:12.541,01:10:15.502,"And worse, he's good at it."
01:10:16.879,01:10:20.716,"Listen, kid. I hope you understand who you're dealing with here."
01:10:21.675,01:10:23.135,This guy is no slouch.
01:10:24.345,01:10:30.100,"When I was a boy, you and papa used to speak of him like he was a ghost."
01:10:31.143,01:10:32.144,Move him.
01:10:39.151,01:10:41.779,only when things got totally fucked.
01:10:42.655,01:10:47.534,"Whenever we needed one of our own bumped off, we'd call this guy in."
01:10:47.618,01:10:50.120,He had a thing for clipping wise guys.
01:10:50.955,01:10:52.331,But only one rule.
01:10:52.873,01:10:55.125,"No women, no kids."
01:10:55.209,01:11:02.299,"Believe me, kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him."
01:11:02.383,01:11:04.468,He's a fucking monster.
01:11:05.052,01:11:05.970,But only one thing.
01:11:06.053,01:11:08.847,He's been rotting in the can the last 25 or 30 years.
01:11:08.931,01:11:11.725,Don't even know if he's still alive or if he's even up to it.
01:11:28.784,01:11:29.660,There.
01:11:33.163,01:11:35.416,"-Well, there are ways around that. -Yeah. Go find one."
01:11:41.964,01:11:43.674,All right. Let's talk some business here.
01:11:43.757,01:11:47.553,I know a sick fuck makes the ones we been doing look like altar boys.
01:11:52.766,01:11:54.601,The guy never says a fucking word to me.
01:11:54.685,01:11:59.815,"We're driving 25 minutes, Never a sigh, no throat clearing, nothing."
01:12:15.164,01:12:17.207,This guy takes out a whole family.
01:12:17.291,01:12:21.170,"Wife, kids, everyone, like he's ordering a fucking pizza."
01:12:37.019,01:12:41.190,He has a poker game out back of his place with a bunch of wise guys every Saturday.
01:12:52.117,01:12:54.328,"Worst day of my life, man."
01:12:55.621,01:12:57.998,"Well, I'm sold."
01:13:01.627,01:13:02.503,"Don't worry, Roc."
01:13:03.128,01:13:05.172,"We'll do this guy right, and you'll feel a lot better."
01:13:26.276,01:13:27.528,Okay.
01:13:29.947,01:13:31.031,Here's what happened.
01:13:36.620,01:13:40.416,They waited in a parked car down the street for the kid to leave.
01:13:43.919,01:13:44.837,There he goes.
01:13:50.968,01:13:52.845,They came in through the garage.
01:13:52.928,01:13:55.848,The kid says he leaves it open when he takes his bike out.
01:13:58.809,01:14:02.521,Now they know the wife is the gatekeeper. She knows the code.
01:14:10.779,01:14:14.074,The wife says she doesn't know what happened after she hit the code.
01:14:14.158,01:14:21.081,"She just remembers going down, but judging from the burn mark on her back… I think what they did was use a stun gun on her."
01:14:21.832,01:14:29.006,Now this guy knows that his friend is coming to the game and they know that this door can only be opened from the inside.
01:14:29.590,01:14:31.091,So they wait.
01:14:31.175,01:14:37.931,"And when that door opens, man… Nobody's ready for it."
01:14:44.688,01:14:46.940,"Panic, devastation."
01:14:47.566,01:14:50.444,This was like shooting fish in a frigging barrel.
01:15:19.264,01:15:20.933,Now these guys dove under the table.
01:15:21.517,01:15:24.394,The trajectory on the bullet showed that they came from straight across.
01:15:24.478,01:15:28.106,So that means one of our shooters dropped to his knees.
01:15:52.005,01:15:53.924,Something went wrong right here.
01:15:54.007,01:15:56.635,Shit! Shit! He ain't here!
01:15:56.718,01:15:58.554,"Oh, what the fuck you mean he isn't here?"
01:15:58.637,01:15:59.721,"I mean, he ain't here."
01:15:59.805,01:16:03.892,"-Look again, for fuck's sake! -I know what the fuck he looks like!"
01:16:05.185,01:16:06.645,Look behind ya.
01:16:12.484,01:16:13.360,"Oh, shit."
01:16:23.579,01:16:25.956,"Now's your chance to earn your stripes, Roc."
01:16:26.039,01:16:28.625,-He'll fucking get killed. -It was your idea to bring him in!
01:16:29.293,01:16:31.587,One of these guys is a real sicko.
01:16:31.670,01:16:34.298,He knew this man. He wanted him to suffer.
01:17:02.326,01:17:06.872,Sick fuck! Sick fuck! Sick fuck!
01:17:08.373,01:17:15.172,"-All right then. -Fuck you, fucking… Now take a fucking deep breath there, Roc. You did fine."
01:17:15.255,01:17:16.298,It was nicely done.
01:17:21.219,01:17:23.388,They exited out the front door.
01:17:23.889,01:17:26.558,They had no idea what they were in for.
01:17:43.533,01:17:45.786,It was a fucking ambush.
01:17:49.331,01:17:53.043,This was a fucking bomb dropping on Beaver Cleaverville.
01:17:55.379,01:17:59.549,"For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon."
01:18:53.478,01:18:56.231,You fucking… You son of a bitch!
01:19:26.219,01:19:29.681,"-Murph, are you all right? -Motherfucker!"
01:19:31.183,01:19:34.561,"-Roc, get the fucking bag! -Fucking shit! Christ!"
01:19:34.644,01:19:36.980,-Get the blood! -What the fuck was that?
01:19:37.063,01:19:39.691,-Get the blood! -He shot my fucking finger off!
01:19:39.775,01:19:42.235,"Roc, what the fuck? Get the fuck out of here!"
01:19:48.366,01:19:49.493,For fuck's sake!
01:19:54.956,01:19:57.000,What if it was just one guy with six guns?
01:19:59.294,01:20:01.671,"Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?"
01:20:03.799,01:20:06.718,"Hey, what's taking so long with those blood samples?"
01:20:11.014,01:20:12.766,There's a variable here I'm not seeing.
01:20:29.533,01:20:31.284,None of this is any good. Fuck!
01:20:32.244,01:20:33.411,You know what that means?
01:20:33.495,01:20:37.332,"Even if we get suspects in the case, we got nothing, nothing, nothing!"
01:20:37.415,01:20:40.085,Fuck! Who the fuck are they?
01:20:40.168,01:20:43.839,I've never seen any fucking thing like this in my fucking life!
01:20:43.922,01:20:45.507,Who the fuck are they?
01:21:24.337,01:21:25.630,"Who the fuck was he, Rocco?"
01:21:25.714,01:21:27.465,"I know you fucking know, so don't even start!"
01:21:27.549,01:21:29.634,Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before!
01:21:29.718,01:21:34.723,That was your fuck… Fuck you! Fuck you both!
01:21:34.806,01:21:39.185,Yeah? Don't start lying to us now! We're fucking three amateurs here!
01:22:24.230,01:22:29.277,I'm confident that their investigation will end… in the apprehension of the suspects.
01:22:31.738,01:22:35.116,"-Fucking hell. -What? What, that guy?"
01:22:35.867,01:22:38.328,That's the guy that got us off the hook with the Checkov thing.
01:22:38.411,01:22:40.538,-And he's one smart man. -They got nothing.
01:22:41.164,01:22:44.584,"Well, this guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will."
01:22:44.668,01:22:45.877,You bet your ass he will.
01:22:45.961,01:22:48.588,"Well, I'd say that makes him a lia-fucking-bility."
01:22:49.172,01:22:51.716,-He isn't to be touched. -He's a good man.
01:22:52.926,01:22:54.970,"Okay, whatever."
01:23:39.264,01:23:40.348,I missed it.
01:23:57.323,01:24:28.063,"Paul, you've already had quite a bit, you know? Are you sure you wanna… This early morning church shit's gotta go."
01:24:28.146,01:24:31.483,"We have to go in the morning. We're on the lam now, you know."
01:25:30.750,01:25:31.835,Hey.
01:25:37.423,01:25:39.300,"You're gonna do what I say, got it?"
01:25:43.763,01:25:46.057,-Yes. -I'm sorry you're gonna have to see this.
01:25:46.141,01:25:47.183,"Well, don't look at me."
01:25:47.267,01:25:50.395,-I didn't see any… -Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
01:25:56.359,01:25:59.571,"That's who I'm doing this for. Now open the fucking thing, Father."
01:25:59.654,01:26:01.364,"Father, I'll do you right here."
01:26:02.323,01:26:05.493,God have mercy on my soul.
01:26:08.538,01:26:11.624,"You little fuck, let him go or I'll drop you right fucking now."
01:26:11.708,01:26:14.544,"Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother."
01:26:14.627,01:26:16.171,He could ruin the whole thing.
01:26:16.254,01:26:19.215,You let him go or I will deliver you right fucking here.
01:26:19.299,01:26:22.135,"You won't do it. You won't, Connor. You love me, man."
01:26:22.218,01:26:23.845,-I swear to fucking… -Oh.
01:26:24.762,01:26:27.307,"-You there? -Yes, my son."
01:26:27.390,01:26:29.976,"Do your thing, Father. Don't fuck this up."
01:26:39.903,01:26:44.407,"I come here for advice, not slalvation."
01:26:44.490,01:26:48.494,Why have you come to a church for counsel if you're not religious?
01:26:49.495,01:26:50.914,It's ethics.
01:26:51.998,01:27:02.091,I put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through.
01:27:02.175,01:27:10.516,I found out there are these two guys who fix the situation with an iron fist as if they had God's permission.
01:27:15.104,01:27:19.192,I believe what they do is necessary. I… I feel it is correct.
01:27:23.404,01:27:27.075,It's like a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us.
01:27:28.576,01:27:32.497,You felt your answers would be here in the house of the Lord today.
01:27:33.998,01:27:37.794,And you feel… these men are necessary.
01:27:39.879,01:27:42.298,So the Lord has spoken to you twice today.
01:27:44.384,01:27:49.055,You are the one who came into this church speaking about beliefs and feelings.
01:27:49.138,01:27:52.558,Is it so hard to believe that God has brought you here?
01:27:54.602,01:27:57.146,It's very easy to be sarcastic about religion.
01:27:58.439,01:28:07.907,"But it's much more difficult… I wanna stand for what I believe in, Father."
01:28:11.953,01:28:16.457,I believe that these young men are right.
01:28:20.378,01:28:23.631,Would they ever harm an innocent person for any reason?
01:28:23.715,01:28:26.426,No. They would never do that.
01:28:27.760,01:28:29.470,"Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't."
01:28:29.554,01:28:31.973,"The Italian guy, he might. He's kind of an idiot."
01:28:33.683,01:28:35.268,I'm beginning to see.
01:28:36.436,01:28:40.815,"All the things I wish I could do, these guys are doing."
01:28:45.278,01:28:51.743,Because I am a man… who's supposed to uphold the law.
01:28:54.454,01:28:59.625,are higher… than the laws… of man.
01:28:59.709,01:29:04.255,"Yes. Yes, I… I was thinking that too. No, no. I was feeling it."
01:29:04.339,01:29:07.091,All I needed was to hear you say it.
01:29:09.260,01:29:10.261,Amen.
01:29:10.345,01:29:12.847,I will help them.
01:29:12.930,01:29:14.557,"-Forgive me, Father. -Thank you, Father."
01:29:18.603,01:29:19.771,Whatever.
01:29:20.813,01:29:23.524,Amen. Goodbye.
01:29:36.579,01:29:38.081,"And remember, you're bound."
01:29:38.164,01:29:40.374,You can't talk to anyone about this. No one.
01:29:40.458,01:29:43.086,-Just get out of the church. -Okay.
01:29:43.169,01:29:45.546,Just get out of the church.
01:29:49.467,01:29:54.013,-The Lord works in mysterious ways. -What the fuck's that supposed to mean?
01:29:57.183,01:30:00.061,-That's all you can give me? -The light hit the side of his face.
01:30:00.144,01:30:02.939,"Looked like he had a gray beard. Maybe late '50s, early '60s."
01:30:03.773,01:30:08.569,So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns and he was a senior freaking citizen?
01:30:08.653,01:30:11.781,"Yeah, and it's better if we find this man before he finds us again."
01:30:11.864,01:30:13.116,I'll see what I can do.
01:30:13.908,01:30:15.284,How do I get in touch with you?
01:30:15.368,01:30:19.205,"We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home."
01:30:19.288,01:30:25.169,We're gonna move on to New York. It's just… -It's getting a bit hot for us here. -Be careful.
01:30:25.253,01:30:27.296,"All right. Call you tonight, afterwards."
01:30:27.380,01:30:30.174,"-It feels like it's still there. -Yeah, but it's not."
01:30:34.637,01:30:36.097,Nobody does.
01:30:36.180,01:30:40.309,The Duke's a fucking Houdini. He does a disappearing act.
01:30:40.393,01:30:42.145,What did he bring him in for?
01:30:42.770,01:30:44.397,"Well, he needs an outsider."
01:30:44.480,01:30:46.774,This Rocco kid is smart.
01:30:46.858,01:30:50.403,He knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
01:30:50.486,01:30:52.905,"Just for him, the package boy?"
01:30:52.989,01:30:55.283,"He's the one shooting up all his guys, right?"
01:30:56.075,01:30:57.285,He's scared of the kid.
01:30:57.368,01:31:00.454,Said he's good. He's got every gun in the city up there.
01:31:00.538,01:31:02.582,-Up where? -Up at his house.
01:31:02.665,01:31:06.002,I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
01:31:06.085,01:31:06.919,"Oh, fuck."
01:31:16.220,01:31:18.306,We got 'em. They tried to get in through the basement.
01:31:19.557,01:31:21.350,-How many? -Three.
01:31:21.434,01:31:23.936,You piece of shit! You piece of shit!
01:31:33.237,01:31:35.406,"I'm fucking talking to you, motherfucker!"
01:31:39.327,01:31:42.830,-No! Fuck you! -Shut up!
01:31:51.631,01:31:53.758,-Rocco. -Sit up.
01:31:58.804,01:31:59.847,Yeah.
01:32:01.182,01:32:02.308,Fuck you.
01:32:07.563,01:32:16.572,Look at him! Look at him… Roc!
01:32:17.782,01:32:22.119,"Roc! Roc, you'll be fine! Roc, you'll be fine!"
01:32:30.253,01:32:32.797,"Okay. So, what do you boys think?"
01:32:33.589,01:32:36.008,"-These guys are tough. -Fucking-A, right."
01:32:36.092,01:32:38.427,-Ain't no fucking way they're gonna talk. -I know Rocco.
01:32:38.511,01:32:41.514,He ain't smart enough for this shit. Those other guys are the brains.
01:32:41.597,01:32:43.557,-He's just a player. -He's a punk.
01:32:45.893,01:32:47.311,There's only one thing to do.
01:32:55.236,01:32:58.906,God! No!
01:33:08.874,01:33:11.043,Roc! Roc!
01:33:14.505,01:33:17.049,No! Roc!
01:33:17.133,01:33:19.051,Roc!
01:33:19.135,01:33:23.472,You can't stop. You get out of here. Don't ever stop.
01:33:23.556,01:33:26.934,Roc… No!
01:33:30.438,01:33:34.358,No! Roc!
01:33:46.579,01:33:49.540,"I don't mean no disrespect, but I think we're forgetting something here."
01:33:49.623,01:33:53.210,This II Duce's a fucking animal. He's gonna stop when someone dies.
01:33:53.294,01:33:56.213,"I guarantee you right now, he thinks this thing is on."
01:34:11.479,01:34:16.901,If this guy still thinks the job is on… Motherfucker is in the bushes right now.
01:34:18.194,01:34:19.236,I am going.
01:34:20.446,01:34:23.657,"You four, stay here and deal with it."
01:34:42.051,01:34:43.386,Do it!
01:34:45.346,01:34:47.431,"-Just one fucking guy. -Fuck you, Geno."
01:34:47.515,01:34:48.933,What's the big fucking deal?
01:34:49.016,01:34:50.017,Do it.
01:34:58.484,01:35:00.528,I'm going back downstairs and working on these pricks.
01:35:23.384,01:35:24.385,Hey.
01:35:25.761,01:35:30.975,Joey Bevo sent me over… as entertainment.
01:35:31.058,01:35:33.060,"Sorry, baby. Tonight ain't the night for this shit."
01:35:33.144,01:35:36.063,"It's really hitting the fan in there, you know what I'm saying?"
01:35:36.147,01:35:37.189,Yeah.
01:35:38.149,01:35:42.153,"Fucking Bevo's great, man. He's always sending us primo box."
01:35:59.462,01:36:02.173,All right. Let's go.
01:36:14.560,01:36:16.854,"-What the fuck are you doing? -Come on, man."
01:36:16.937,01:36:19.023,I haven't been laid in a week. It'll take five minutes.
01:36:21.567,01:36:22.401,Hurry up.
01:36:28.407,01:36:32.119,"Oh, baby. Oh, come to Mama."
01:36:32.203,01:36:36.207,"-You're a dirty girl. No. -Come to Mama. Oh, come to Mama. Oh."
01:36:36.290,01:36:38.083,"-You wanna ride the champ? -Yeah, baby."
01:36:38.167,01:36:39.418,All right. All right.
01:36:39.502,01:36:42.463,"-All right. Let's do it, man. Ringside. -Big, strong man. Come on, baby."
01:36:42.546,01:36:44.924,"Yeah, that's right. You want a little shot at the title?"
01:36:45.007,01:37:10.741,I'll give you a shot at the title right here… Too far.
01:37:12.326,01:37:13.577,Too far.
01:37:32.721,01:37:34.056,It's on now.
01:37:45.192,01:37:46.819,"Hey, babe. What's it, two for one?"
01:37:47.903,01:37:49.238,Oh!
01:38:27.526,01:38:29.194,"for Thee, my Lord, for Thee."
01:38:37.661,01:38:42.124,That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.
01:38:43.125,01:38:52.968,"We will flow a river forth unto Thee… and teeming with souls shall it ever be.  In nomine Patris, et fillii, et Spiritus Sancti."
01:39:09.652,01:39:14.531,Standing trial today for the third time in two years is infamous Mafia don Pappa Joe Yakavetta.
01:39:15.115,01:39:22.206,Yakavetta takes the stand to defend himself against allegations of his involvement in the ordered killings of no less than 17 men.
01:39:22.790,01:39:28.045,The state's case against him relies heavily on circumstantial evidence and a third acquittal has already been predicted.
01:39:32.257,01:39:37.262,"Yet, the blood of the wicked… shall flow like a river."
01:39:38.514,01:39:44.061,"The three shall spread their blackened wings and be the vengeful, striking hammer of God."
01:39:45.437,01:39:48.232,"Ah. Eh, I was with my mother."
01:39:48.315,01:39:57.950,"We were at the Genovese, the butcher, uh, because on Thursdays she makes a gnocchi for… you will demonstrate order in my courtroom."
01:39:58.867,01:40:01.787,"-Counsel, proceed. -Look at his charisma."
01:40:01.870,01:40:03.247,He's the next John Gotti.
01:40:04.039,01:40:06.291,He'll walk even with all this evidence.
01:40:07.209,01:40:09.795,"Look, all of Yakavetta's people are on the left."
01:40:09.878,01:40:12.297,All the families of the men he's killed are on the right.
01:40:12.798,01:40:14.425,Everyone wants some justice.
01:40:14.508,01:40:17.803,-I don't know where I was. -Look at him.
01:40:17.886,01:40:19.596,He doesn't have a care in the world.
01:40:30.399,01:40:32.401,Shut the fucking camera!
01:40:32.484,01:40:36.822,"Up top, drop your guns. One at a time. Now. Drop it."
01:40:37.406,01:40:38.907,-Come here. -Where are you taking me?
01:40:38.991,01:40:42.286,-What are you doing? What are you doing? -Shut the fuck up!
01:40:42.369,01:40:43.328,Get to the back.
01:40:49.209,01:40:56.091,You people have been chosen… to reveal our existence to the world.
01:40:57.718,01:41:02.389,You will witness what happens here today and you will tell of it later.
01:41:04.141,01:41:05.476,All eyes to the front.
01:41:06.435,01:41:09.104,-Now is a good time to fucking… -Shut your fucking mouth!
01:41:23.452,01:41:24.828,"You must watch, dear."
01:41:25.704,01:41:27.456,It'll all be over soon.
01:41:39.635,01:41:41.887,Now you will receive us.
01:41:41.970,01:41:44.973,We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
01:41:45.057,01:41:47.476,We do not want your tired and sick.
01:41:47.559,01:41:49.144,It is your corrupt we claim.
01:41:49.228,01:41:51.688,It is your evil that will be sought by us.
01:41:51.772,01:41:54.316,"With every breath, we shall hunt them down."
01:41:54.399,01:41:59.822,"Each day, we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies."
01:41:59.905,01:42:03.158,Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal.
01:42:03.242,01:42:06.245,These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
01:42:06.328,01:42:10.666,"These are not polite suggestions, these are codes of behavior."
01:42:10.749,01:42:13.502,And those of you that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
01:42:13.585,01:42:15.546,There are varying degrees of evil.
01:42:16.046,01:42:24.012,"We urge you lesser forms of filth not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption, into our domain."
01:42:24.096,01:42:29.268,"For if you do, one day you will look behind you and you will see we three."
01:42:29.351,01:42:32.855,"And on that day, you will reap it."
01:42:32.938,01:42:36.483,And we will send you to whatever god you wish.
01:42:41.363,01:42:44.324,"And shepherds we will be, for Thee, my Lord, for Thee."
01:42:44.408,01:42:49.496,Power hath descended forth from Thy hand… That our feet may swiftly carry out Thy command.
01:42:49.580,01:42:54.001,So we shall flow a river forth to Thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be.
01:42:54.084,01:42:59.089,In nomine Patris… Et fillii… Et Spiritus Sancti.
01:43:27.701,01:43:29.453,"How far are we going to take this, Da?"
01:43:37.210,01:43:39.171,The question is not how far.
01:43:40.756,01:43:51.099,"The question is, do you possess the constitution, the depth of faith, to go as far as is needed?"
01:43:55.771,01:44:06.448,After the astonishing display of vigilantism during the Yakavetta trial yesterday… the largest manhunt in recent memory is being undertaken to capture three men the media have dubbed The Saints.
01:44:06.531,01:44:10.452,This reporter went out to the street to find out what you thought about these three.
01:44:10.535,01:44:15.999,"Somebody can just go out, get a gun and shoot somebody because they feel that… That they're doing some good -in the world? -No comment."
01:44:16.083,01:44:18.710,-Making the world a safer place. -Are you kidding?
01:44:18.794,01:44:20.796,They're killing for good and only the people who kill.
01:44:20.879,01:44:22.297,Killing for good? Listen to yourself.
01:44:22.381,01:44:24.424,This is gonna create something so much worse.
01:44:24.508,01:44:27.803,"-I don't think so at all. -Well, I think you're just naive then."
01:44:27.886,01:44:30.138,"I love the Saints, man. They doing a great job."
01:44:30.222,01:44:32.432,"Keep it going, man. Get these murderers off the streets."
01:44:32.516,01:44:34.977,They're not out there just killing for fame.
01:44:35.060,01:44:37.813,-They just wanna be famous. -They should be in every major city.
01:44:37.896,01:44:39.940,-Every major city. -These guys are playing God.

01:44:42.567,01:44:44.152,Hell yeah. I believe in capital punishment.
01:44:44.236,01:44:45.570,"If they let me, I'd pull the switch."
01:44:45.654,01:44:47.197,Get 'em all. Kill 'em all.
01:44:49.449,01:44:52.285,"The more people they kill, the better it is for everybody."
01:44:52.369,01:44:55.789,"That's exactly what they get… No, do not do that, Laquelle, because you don't even know."

01:45:09.094,01:45:11.096,I can't even believe you're saying that. That's crazy.
01:45:11.179,01:45:13.223,When did you turn into such a sissy?
