00:00:40.749,00:00:42.333,in six weeks.
00:00:48.965,00:00:49.799,for me being suspended.
00:00:52.969,00:00:55.013,but has she done some sketchy things to get there?
00:01:04.064,00:01:05.690,and can see her making her way into the car.
00:01:08.276,00:01:16.493,"at the beginning, or needing to take some time to work on your craft, voluntarily bringing attention to herself with her donation."
00:01:21.790,00:01:23.833,but I think Taylor Swift is learning a few lessons in life.
00:13:25.513,00:13:30.142,"Well, good evening, Dallas, Texas, and welcome to the Reputation stadium tour."
00:13:37.900,00:13:42.071,"You know, guys, I've been coming to play in the Dallas-Arlington area..."
00:13:44.031,00:13:46.367,since I was about 15 years old.
00:13:48.244,00:13:49.245,"And, uh..."
00:13:50.454,00:13:56.919,I was looking at the list of times I've played here and this is actually the 30th show that I'll be playing in this area.
00:14:00.965,00:14:06.303,"So that's a good, long history we've got going on between us and I want to say thank you for a few things."
00:14:06.679,00:14:16.063,"First of all, having been to Dallas as many times as I've been here, I know how many things there are available for you to do on a Saturday night."
00:14:16.146,00:14:21.235,You have lots of options and you decided to spend your Saturday evening with us.
00:14:21.318,00:14:22.778,Thank you so much!
00:14:29.285,00:14:31.161,Another thing that you guys did...
00:14:34.039,00:14:45.968,"is that every single one of us on this stage, on this tour, gets to know that because of you, this is the first tour, nobody has ever played back-to-back nights at this stadium before."
00:14:46.051,00:14:47.094,"Thank you, guys!"
00:14:55.060,00:15:02.818,"So, here you are, deciding to be with us on-- You may have heard this. It's a little-known fact."
00:15:03.027,00:15:05.237,This is the last night of the US tour.
00:15:09.825,00:15:17.791,"And so you decided not only to spend your Saturday night with us, but to come here to commemorate the last night on this tour that has meant so much to me."
00:15:17.875,00:15:19.627,That is such a beautiful thing.
00:15:19.710,00:15:22.463,Thank you for deciding all of those things tonight.
00:15:27.509,00:15:28.802,I would even say...
00:15:29.929,00:15:31.680,it's something even more than beautiful.
00:15:31.764,00:15:34.516,It's like a step above beautiful.
00:15:34.600,00:15:36.560,"What's the word for that, Dallas?"
00:15:38.687,00:15:39.605,That's the one.
00:17:53.405,00:18:00.871,"And now, Dallas, I would like to introduce you the incredibly talented, gorgeous women of the Reputation stadium tour."
00:18:01.121,00:18:02.289,Make some noise...
00:18:02.915,00:18:03.791,for Jazz!
00:18:08.587,00:18:09.630,Gracie!
00:18:10.798,00:18:11.965,Kamilah!
00:18:13.717,00:18:14.718,Jeslyn.
00:18:16.220,00:18:17.304,Melanie!
00:18:18.514,00:18:19.556,Nadine!
00:18:21.517,00:18:22.434,Stephanie!
00:18:23.936,00:18:24.770,Yoe!
00:18:27.397,00:18:28.315,Eliotte.
00:18:30.567,00:18:32.945,And I'm Taylor. Thanks for hanging out with us tonight!
00:19:39.511,00:19:40.345,Mmm!
00:22:23.633,00:22:26.970,"Dallas, will you please make some noise for my incredible band?"
00:25:45.502,00:25:46.461,Let me see you jump!
00:31:28.011,00:31:31.014,"Sorry, but old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
00:31:32.056,00:31:36.019,"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!"
00:41:21.061,00:41:22.104,Are we having fun yet?
00:41:27.026,00:41:28.194,"Oh, good."
00:41:29.320,00:41:31.238,"You know, you may notice this..."
00:41:32.156,00:41:35.701,"Not sure if you picked up on it yet. I'm pretty sure you have, though."
00:41:35.784,00:41:40.414,Have you noticed that you have a light-up bracelet on your wrist?
00:41:40.498,00:41:41.665,There they are.
00:41:44.293,00:41:45.544,So pretty.
00:41:45.878,00:41:48.255,"Um, but that's not the only thing about them."
00:41:48.339,00:41:57.556,"The reason why I wanted to have these on the tour is because this is actually my very first all-stadium tour, which..."
00:42:01.936,00:42:05.272,"Which has been so, so much fun because of you."
00:42:05.439,00:42:06.315,Um...
00:42:06.732,00:42:10.528,"So, one thing I do know about stadiums is they're just..."
00:42:11.487,00:42:20.246,"massive places to play, and so I wanted to make sure that no matter what, I could see every single one of you in these stadiums."
00:42:22.206,00:42:29.046,"...top, top deck, last row and you think I can't see you, that would be incorrect."
00:42:30.172,00:42:33.217,I can see absolutely every person in this stadium.
00:42:34.760,00:42:38.889,"And I can see you dancing, I can see you throwing your hands in the air."
00:42:39.390,00:42:41.308,"And on top of that, I can hear..."
00:42:42.184,00:42:53.821,"I can hear the-- It really seems like every single person in this crowd has memorized every single word to the songs, ...screaming them."
00:42:58.075,00:43:01.787,If I had to take a guess and say the one thing...
00:43:02.621,00:43:05.583,that probably everybody in this stadium has in common...
00:43:07.126,00:43:09.878,I think I would say that one thing would be...
00:43:10.713,00:43:14.383,that we all like the feeling of finding something real.
00:43:15.259,00:43:16.260,Like...
00:43:16.927,00:43:21.849,"you know, finding real friendship or finding real love or somebody who really gets you."
00:43:22.641,00:43:24.977,Or someone who's really honest with you.
00:43:25.060,00:43:29.440,"I think-- I think that's what we're really all looking for in life, and..."
00:43:30.316,00:43:40.284,I think the things that can scare us the most in life are the things that we think will threaten the prospect of us finding something real.
00:43:41.452,00:43:50.502,"For example, having a bad reputation, in our mind, could get in the way of you finding..."
00:43:51.211,00:43:59.970,"real friendship, real love, real acceptance, people you really fit in with. Because you think to yourself, What if they've heard something about me that isn't true?"
00:44:00.054,00:44:04.224,What if they've got these preconceived notions about me that they heard from gossip?
00:44:04.683,00:44:09.313,"And then they never even wanna meet me, and then we'll never know what could've happened."
00:44:10.314,00:44:18.822,"And I think that's why some of us-- meaning most, if not all of us-- are sort of afraid of having a bad reputation."
00:44:19.323,00:44:30.042,"Because we're so scared of something fake, like gossip or a rumor about you, or a name you got called, getting in the way of you finding something real."
00:44:30.834,00:44:40.260,"And so, when it comes down to that fear and that anxiety, it's just all really delicate, don't you think, Dallas?"
00:48:36.538,00:48:38.790,"All right, Dallas. I..."
00:48:39.625,00:48:41.335,just decided to do...
00:48:42.336,00:48:45.255,a little exploring around the stadium to see...
00:48:46.089,00:48:48.634,if you guys are having a good time back here.
00:48:50.010,00:48:51.845,Are things fun back here?
00:48:52.387,00:48:55.057,"All right. Well, would you dance with me? What do you say?"
00:50:04.459,00:50:09.881,"All right, Dallas, make some noise once again for Charli XCX and Camila Cabello!"
00:52:43.243,00:52:47.038,Give it up again for Charli XCX and Camila Cabello!
00:53:31.499,00:53:34.711,"So, you guys, I was wondering if, um..."
00:53:35.629,00:53:37.923,if it would be all right with you if we just had a...
00:53:38.632,00:53:39.674,Thank you so much.
00:53:40.508,00:53:44.012,There's a-- I feel like it's really important to be honest with you guys.
00:53:44.095,00:53:47.224,"I have a little-- a tiny, minuscule cold."
00:53:47.307,00:53:48.600,Do not mind this.
00:53:49.351,00:53:51.603,This is just gonna be me blowing my nose.
00:53:52.395,00:53:53.939,I'm gonna turn around to do it.
00:54:02.280,00:54:07.869,But I-- What I really think we all need to take note of is how Giuseppe presented me with the tissue.
00:54:07.953,00:54:09.120,Like this.
00:54:12.916,00:54:14.751,That's like the best thing I've ever seen.
00:54:15.418,00:54:20.757,I've never been handed a tissue with more presentation and commitment.
00:54:21.633,00:54:23.093,"Um, okay, guys."
00:54:24.052,00:54:25.762,Wanna talk to you about something.
00:54:25.845,00:54:32.394,I'm proposing the idea that we spend some time with just you and me and the guitar. Is that all right with you?
00:54:38.191,00:54:40.318,"So, one thing that you guys have always been..."
00:54:40.735,00:54:41.987,"really, uh..."
00:54:42.821,00:54:48.660,"really not just supportive about, but you've, um-- 'Cause that sounds like you were, like, understanding of it."
00:54:48.743,00:54:57.460,"You've really encouraged me to experiment with my music and try different things, try different sounds, try different instruments. Um..."
00:54:58.670,00:55:02.841,You guys were always the ones pushing me to experiment and grow.
00:55:02.924,00:55:05.719,And I really appreciate that. 'Cause...
00:55:06.553,00:55:12.267,"I have had so much fun switching up, you know, styles of music..."
00:55:14.185,00:55:16.271,genres... um...
00:55:18.315,00:55:26.906,"And there are a lot of people in the music industry that thought when you start in one genre of music, you stay there, because that's what people are used to and that's what they like."
00:55:27.324,00:55:30.910,But my relationship with you and how much we talk...
00:55:31.494,00:55:37.125,"online, how much we meet each other at the shows, or like at my house, or..."
00:55:42.505,00:56:06.863,"I know from our conversations that you guys are so all about lyrics and all about a feeling, and all about, if whatever it is that the person that you listen to is singing about what you happen to be going through, or did go through at one point in time, I-- I think that's kind of all you care about when it comes to a song."
00:56:09.824,00:56:11.826,So I've always written songs...
00:56:12.994,00:56:25.298,"with the lyrics, the feeling, and the melody in mind, hoping that no matter what production I added to the top of it, whether it took a turn for pop or acoustic or whatever..."
00:56:26.174,00:56:29.928,I always wanted for a song to be able to be stripped back down...
00:56:31.262,00:56:36.810,and still be something that you liked and wanted to sing at the top of your lungs.
01:00:58.696,01:01:00.782,"You know, when I write a song..."
01:01:01.491,01:01:03.493,"When I write a song, it's usually..."
01:01:04.243,01:01:05.787,me just trying to...
01:01:07.163,01:01:10.833,get past something and understand something I'm going through...
01:01:11.834,01:01:13.753,"by writing about it, and..."
01:01:14.629,01:01:19.217,"that was definitely the case um, when I wrote the next song I'm gonna play."
01:01:19.926,01:01:24.681,"On this tour, we've had this really wonderful tradition that's kind of come about, where..."
01:01:26.683,01:01:34.107,"And it started with you. You guys were saying to me online, I really want you to play older songs that you don't play very often."
01:01:37.151,01:01:39.779,"And so I was like, Okay!"
01:01:40.405,01:01:44.158,"And so this tradition kind of came about, and, uh..."
01:01:44.742,01:01:47.495,"I'm really glad you told me to do that, 'cause it's really fun."
01:01:47.578,01:01:51.165,It's super fun going back through and playing songs I haven't played in forever.
01:01:51.666,01:02:00.216,"And-- So this song is a song that-- It's weird, because I feel like this song has two lives to it in my brain."
01:02:00.383,01:02:14.564,"In my brain, there's the life of this song where this song was born out of catharsis and venting and trying to get over something and trying to understand it and process it."
01:02:15.606,01:02:22.530,And then there's the life where it went out into the world and you turned this song into something completely different for me.
01:02:26.075,01:02:35.084,"You turned this song into a collage of memories of watching you scream the words to this song, or..."
01:02:36.586,01:02:50.516,"...seeing pictures that you post to me of you having written the words to this song in your diary, or you showing me your wrist, and you have a tattoo of the lyrics to this song underneath your skin."
01:02:50.808,01:02:53.853,And that is how you have changed the song All Too Well for me.
01:08:51.460,01:09:01.095,"All right, of all the times that I've heard that sung incredibly loudly I think tonight, Dallas, at the end of this tour, our last night, that was the loudest I've ever heard that song."
01:09:05.349,01:09:12.898,"And there was a huge, bellowing chorus of singing coming from this side of the stadium, so I have to check it out."
01:09:12.982,01:09:15.317,I'm gonna come over and see you. Here I come!
01:10:16.587,01:10:17.463,You ready?
01:14:42.561,01:14:43.395,So...
01:14:46.273,01:14:50.903,"as I was walking through the crowd, I could not help but notice..."
01:14:51.820,01:14:56.909,"Here we are on the last night of the tour, and you guys did not come to play."
01:14:56.992,01:15:01.371,You did not come in regular outfits tonight.
01:15:01.455,01:15:17.054,"You are in ensembles, you are in costumes, you're, like, wearing crowns, with snakes around your neck, with your face covered in glitter, with lyrics all over your arms, with 13s on your hands..."
01:15:19.139,01:15:25.437,"You guys are absolutely, absolutely incredible, and I'm really feeling like I need to get on your level."
01:15:26.021,01:15:27.981,Because you guys seem to be dressing...
01:15:29.191,01:15:32.236,in correspondence with lyrics of the songs.
01:15:32.319,01:15:34.029,Am I correct about that?
01:15:37.991,01:15:39.910,I think what I should do now...
01:15:41.453,01:15:42.829,is wear a dress...
01:15:43.705,01:15:45.624,to play a song called Dress.
01:15:45.707,01:15:47.167,What do we think about that?
01:31:15.803,01:31:17.096,"I know that, uh..."
01:31:18.139,01:31:27.315,"when you meet people, when you first hang out with people, you're supposed to play it cool, be sort of casual and just be like, Yeah, I'm having a good time with you. You guys seem cool."
01:31:27.398,01:31:31.652,"But seriously, this is such an incredible crowd, I absolutely adore you."
01:31:32.236,01:31:35.781,I loved you as soon as I heard you screaming.
01:31:43.080,01:31:46.209,"So we started this tour in May, and um..."
01:31:46.959,01:31:49.837,"honestly, I have never experienced a tour..."
01:31:50.963,01:31:54.383,that seemed to fly past this quickly.
01:31:54.467,01:31:56.802,'Cause we're having so much fun on this tour.
01:31:56.886,01:31:59.138,We're having so much fun with you guys.
01:31:59.931,01:32:02.183,I can't even tell you how much.
01:32:06.938,01:32:09.232,"So, when I say we, I mean..."
01:32:10.858,01:32:20.993,"all of the people that you see on the stage with me: the dancers, the backup singers, the band, everybody who you see up here with me. Um..."
01:32:22.328,01:32:29.585,"Camila, Charli, all these wonderful, incredible, iconic people I get to be onstage with."
01:32:32.213,01:32:36.008,We've all dreamed about being on a stage like this since we were little kids.
01:32:36.092,01:32:44.767,"And I think when we were little kids, I think I can speak for all of us and say I don't think we ever imagined we'd be on stages this big with crowds this incredible."
01:32:44.850,01:32:47.478,I think this has sort of exceeded any kind of...
01:32:53.943,01:32:54.902,But so...
01:32:55.236,01:32:59.448,"we get to be out here with you every single night on this stage, but that is..."
01:33:00.783,01:33:08.416,"I mean, that is nothing compared to the effort and the work that has gone into building this stage."
01:33:08.499,01:33:24.307,"We have 368 people who travel with us around the world, leave their families behind, drive trucks, help put up the steel, help build the stage, help do lighting, sound, you name it."
01:33:24.390,01:33:31.564,"Tuning our instruments, just helping us get to the place, to the point where we can get up here and do what we love to do."
01:33:31.647,01:33:48.539,"On top of that, Dallas and Arlington, this area provided us with 3,200 people who did security for us, who sold food, who did parking, who helped us build this, who will take this apart with us after the show."
01:33:49.999,01:33:55.004,They're the people who will help sweep up the glitter when we all go home. Um...
01:33:55.254,01:33:56.339,And so...
01:33:57.048,01:34:04.597,"I wanna say thank you to every single person who has helped us put on this stage tonight, and especially security here, for keeping us safe."
01:34:04.972,01:34:06.349,Thank you so much to everyone.
01:34:06.432,01:34:09.393,Let's hear a round of applause for everyone who helped us do this.
01:34:20.446,01:34:27.495,"And then, of course, um, there really wouldn't be a show to put on or a stage to put up if you guys..."
01:34:28.162,01:34:31.332,didn't wanna come be at the show.
01:34:32.625,01:34:33.709,So...
01:34:37.004,01:40:02.037,"this is a song that, for me, I love you guys, so, so, so, so, so, so, so much."
01:42:15.295,01:42:39.111,"Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices, Echoes she heard even in her sleep: Whatever you say, it is not right."
01:42:39.194,01:42:41.405,"Whatever you do, it is not enough."
01:42:41.864,01:42:43.574,Your kindness is fake.
01:42:44.032,01:42:46.076,Your pain is manipulative.
01:42:46.994,01:42:58.005,"When she lay there on the ground, She dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something, Not just the idea of something."
01:42:59.256,01:43:42.549,"When she finally rose, she rose slowly Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies Wary of phone calls and promises, Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck Bathed in her brokenness Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed Standing broad-shouldered next to her was a love that was really something, not just the idea of something."
01:43:44.009,01:44:08.909,"When she turned to go home, She heard the echoes of new words May your heart remain breakable But never by the same hand twice And even louder: without your past, you could never have arrived-- so wondrously and brutally, By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance ...here."
01:55:41.893,01:56:48.668,I can't-- Thank you so much for an incredible evening and an amazing tour. We love you.
01:56:48.918,01:56:50.753,Please give it up for the dancers.
02:03:13.928,02:03:17.431,"Okay, so, first of all-- First of all, um..."
02:03:18.432,02:03:24.522,I don't-- Great drumming.
02:03:25.231,02:03:28.943,-Like my drums? I'm air-drumming. -Cool. Amazing.
02:03:29.068,02:03:30.444,I've never seen it before.
02:03:30.528,02:03:32.446,"-Really? -Yeah, I'm back there."
02:03:32.988,02:03:34.031,-So-- -I'm just...
02:03:36.033,02:03:41.914,"This is one of the-- It's-- One, two-- I'm more of a... Drummer! Drummer!"
02:03:43.499,02:03:44.417,"Oh, no."
02:03:45.501,02:03:46.710,My costume change.
02:03:47.086,02:03:50.297,This is exactly-- This is what I do when I don't know choreography.
02:03:52.299,02:03:53.467,-Yeah. -Yeah.
02:03:53.551,02:03:55.553,"-But, like-- -Yeah, the side?"
02:03:55.636,02:04:01.600,-That's I don't know my choreography. -That's-- -Can we do it again? I missed all of it. -Okay.
02:04:01.684,02:04:04.270,"I just didn't even get on the train, 'cause it left the station."
02:04:06.981,02:04:10.151,There's too many-- The words are all the same over and over again.
02:04:10.234,02:04:12.695,"-And I know that's my fault. But-- -No, it's okay."
02:04:14.822,02:04:17.491,You can't just put it in front of me and not have me drink that.
02:04:17.575,02:04:18.784,It's an Old Fashioned.
02:04:19.243,02:04:21.954,I have to test it. It's my responsibility.
02:04:22.037,02:04:29.003,You think I could put on a stage or serve these people This is beyond the feat of engineering.
02:04:35.009,02:04:39.763,The amount of decking that we have is equivalent to ten arena tours.
02:04:39.847,02:04:41.098,That's just decking.
02:04:41.682,02:04:43.642,"-It's bigger than a 767. -Oh, my God."
02:04:43.726,02:04:45.394,"Wingspan, nose to tail."
02:04:46.187,02:04:48.105,"-Oh, my God. -Look at that."
02:04:48.189,02:04:50.816,"-What's a 767? -It's an airplane, a big one."
02:04:51.692,02:04:57.948,You guys are just gonna need to leave little trails of candy to just get me -to go to the right places. -Little Reese's Pieces.
02:04:58.824,02:04:59.700,Nobody...
02:05:00.784,02:05:02.703,-What do you need? -I was lost.
02:05:03.329,02:05:04.413,It's a big stage.
02:05:07.208,02:05:09.710,"Okay, I'm alone out here, so I feel like I'm in the wrong place."
02:05:10.377,02:05:13.380,I really am gonna need to study a map of this thing.
02:05:13.464,02:05:14.298,I know.
