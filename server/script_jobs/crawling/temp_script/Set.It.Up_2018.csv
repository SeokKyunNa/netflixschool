00:00:49.841,00:00:53.094,"As in if there are onions, I will be killed."
00:00:53.470,00:00:57.515,"I know it says, Do not duplicate, but my boss says, Do duplicate."
00:00:57.599,00:01:00.685,"And right now, her rules supersede the state of New York's."
00:01:00.769,00:01:05.106,"Janet, I've got a master's in sociology and nothing else to do today."
00:01:05.190,00:01:07.358,Put me on hold as long as you want.
00:01:07.442,00:01:10.862,I'm not hanging up until his seat is bumped to first class.
00:01:12.781,00:01:13.615,I'm coming.
00:01:13.698,00:01:14.657,I'm coming.
00:01:16.951,00:01:22.582,He wanted me to let you know that he's breaking up with you and he needs you out of the apartment by 6:00.
00:01:29.422,00:01:32.258,Get this to my doctor. That needs to be warm.
00:01:33.009,00:01:34.636,And ask if it's contagious.

00:03:04.517,00:03:05.351,No?
00:03:07.186,00:03:10.106,That's fine. I'll be here for the next 45 minutes.
00:03:10.440,00:03:11.774,I'll be here forever.

00:03:50.438,00:03:51.272,I'm out.
00:03:51.981,00:03:54.400,"-How'd it go? You, uh, gonna invest? -Ha."
00:03:54.484,00:04:02.242,I'll invest in that company when they figure out how to dip their dicks in ink and write the Japanese symbol for horse shit.
00:04:04.494,00:04:05.328,Do the thing.
00:04:06.246,00:04:08.456,Think of seared cod.
00:04:08.706,00:04:14.128,"Melt-in-your-mouth uni. Buttered carrots, mashed potatoes, crispy onion rings."

00:04:24.013,00:04:27.767,-Should I order dinner? -Of course not. I just had my juice.
00:04:28.309,00:04:32.230,-Sometimes you end up wanting dinner. -Shut my damn door.

00:04:38.486,00:04:44.367,"tomorrow, we're gonna post the Alex Morgan profile in the morning and the Belichick interview in the afternoon."
00:04:44.450,00:04:47.495,Hold the Belichick interview. Josh is writing like he's at The Post.
00:04:47.578,00:04:50.456,The Line Up is about the story behind the score.

00:04:55.586,00:04:58.131,-Did you return my blue jacket? -Yes.
00:04:58.965,00:05:05.847,"After a 2-hour commute to their warehouse and an intense talk with a saleswoman that ended with us in tears, I got a full refund."

00:05:08.850,00:05:19.444,"You owe RSVPs to Polly's wedding, Annie's baby shower, Bridget's baby shower, Alice's son's birthday. You RSVP'd Jane's wedding, but they need your okay to share a room with Helen since you're both coming alone."
00:05:20.320,00:05:27.952,Do they need me to confirm that I'm gonna spend a thousand dollars a night to share bunk beds like kids at sleep-away camp?
00:05:28.745,00:05:29.579,No.
00:05:29.662,00:05:31.956,This site is less than a year old.
00:05:32.040,00:05:36.461,I can't be expected to attend every friend of a friend's kid's 3rd birthday.
00:05:36.544,00:05:39.213,Decline every invitation and send a $200 gift.
00:05:39.297,00:05:40.465,$200 gift.
00:05:40.548,00:05:43.760,There should be three times as many story ideas by now.
00:05:43.843,00:05:45.386,I might have a story idea.
00:05:51.392,00:05:54.270,"It's not fleshed out. I haven't cracked it, so..."
00:05:54.353,00:05:57.398,"Oh, good. So, you're telling me it's bad before I've even heard it."
00:05:57.774,00:06:01.486,It's this thing... called the Gerilympics.
00:06:02.361,00:06:04.572,It's an Olympics for senior citizens.
00:06:05.490,00:06:09.202,"They have races, ping-pong, Nerf basketball, and weightlifting."
00:06:09.285,00:06:12.830,"Yes, people think it's silly. People think it's silly, but..."
00:06:14.749,00:06:22.006,"But it gives them something to live for. And a lot of them were athletes who never even got a chance to, like..."
00:06:24.383,00:06:25.927,To live their dreams.
00:06:27.637,00:06:32.141,"It's just sometimes I get emotional over sports, just how they can provide..."
00:06:33.601,00:06:34.560,Your dinner.
00:06:35.895,00:06:37.855,Which I'm gonna go get right now.
00:06:39.565,00:06:40.900,What's my tomorrow like?
00:06:40.983,00:06:43.903,Um... I moved your lunch to Ai Fiori's.
00:06:44.612,00:06:46.823,Kiki wants to go over divorce papers.
00:06:46.906,00:06:49.325,"Okay, you can tell Kiki she can light herself on fire."
00:06:49.992,00:06:53.412,-And if she calls or--? -You tell her she don't divorce me.
00:06:53.830,00:06:54.872,I divorce her.
00:06:55.414,00:06:59.252,Call my lawyer and tell him to counter-serve her for serving me.
00:07:00.586,00:07:03.589,-I don't know if legally-- -What is this? I hate it.
00:07:03.923,00:07:06.050,This is your son's science project.
00:07:06.592,00:07:09.595,It's a fun play on when life gives you lemons...
00:07:09.762,00:07:11.848,I'm using lemon battery to power...
00:07:15.059,00:07:15.977,Where's my dinner?
00:07:19.689,00:07:23.818,Did you want dinner? Because you s-- No problem.
00:07:25.445,00:07:26.404,Coming right up.
00:07:27.113,00:07:29.907,I order from you guys like three times a week.
00:07:29.991,00:07:33.369,You know that I'm good for it. I have three credit cards.
00:07:33.619,00:07:35.538,-Can I write a check? -Cash only.
00:07:35.621,00:07:38.249,What if I pay you triple... tomorrow?
00:07:38.624,00:07:39.459,Cash only.
00:07:39.542,00:07:44.714,What if I told you this face was a mask and I'm a 100-year-old gypsy who will curse your family for generations?
00:07:45.173,00:07:46.007,Cash only.
00:07:46.841,00:07:51.345,What grocery store doesn't serve saffron-infused Kobe beef cooked medium-rare?
00:07:55.183,00:07:56.976,or for me to commit a felony.
00:07:57.059,00:07:58.769,Hi. Whose food is this?
00:07:58.853,00:08:01.230,"-It's mine. -You got 31.32, it's yours."
00:08:01.772,00:08:04.233,I have cash. I have so much cash.
00:08:04.317,00:08:06.652,"No. Hey, hey. That's my boss's dinner."
00:08:06.736,00:08:10.740,"If I'm not upstairs in two minutes with that food, I will get fired."
00:08:13.117,00:08:15.077,-Can I borrow some money? -No.
00:08:15.495,00:08:21.876,"This is my boss's dinner. If I'm not up in two minutes, -I'm gonna be fired. -No, you won't. Look at you."
00:08:22.460,00:08:26.255,You'll just swoop in with your lacrosse stick and your fraternity connections.
00:08:26.339,00:08:29.884,You'll keep getting promoted for no reason. I need that food.
00:08:31.010,00:08:33.721,Thirty-two dollars. Keep the change. Thank you.
00:08:34.180,00:08:36.182,Is this happening? I will not forget this.
00:08:36.265,00:08:37.934,-Whatever. -Wait. Sir?
00:08:38.017,00:08:42.563,"Sir. There are two dinners. One for me and one for her, so we could split it."
00:08:42.647,00:08:47.735,I can take one to my boss and you can take one to yours. Please. This is DEFCON 5.
00:08:48.486,00:08:52.698,"DEFCON 5's the good one. Everything's safe, international travel's fine."
00:08:52.782,00:08:54.617,DEFCON 1! You know what I mean.
00:08:56.577,00:08:57.703,What are the meals?
00:08:57.787,00:09:00.957,Okay. I'm gonna take her the truffle mac and cheese.
00:09:01.040,00:09:02.458,You can have the burger.
00:09:03.584,00:09:06.504,Are you insane? I won't give him a plain hamburger. He has taste.
00:09:06.587,00:09:08.422,"Okay. I'm gonna fix this, okay?"
00:09:09.215,00:09:13.678,See what I'm making? It's a truffle cheeseburger with kale.
00:09:16.180,00:09:19.100,This burger could win awards. Pickle is my dinner.
00:09:19.183,00:09:20.268,"-No, no, no. -What?"
00:09:20.518,00:09:23.062,I won't give him a truffle cheeseburger without a pickle.
00:09:27.233,00:09:30.736,"I wanna be paid back tomorrow, 8 percent interest, liquidity preference."
00:09:30.820,00:09:32.530,Do I look like I can afford interest?
00:09:32.613,00:09:34.991,I steal my toilet paper from the office bathroom.
00:09:35.074,00:09:37.493,You should learn to keep cash on you.
00:09:38.286,00:09:41.706,You should remember to order dinner before everything closes.
00:09:41.789,00:09:44.625,You know that pickle? That aforementioned pickle?
00:09:44.709,00:09:47.086,That wasn't for my boss. That was for me.
00:09:49.005,00:09:50.214,You're a monster.
00:09:54.260,00:09:57.013,"-Oh, hi. -I'll need you in here before me tomorrow."
00:09:57.096,00:10:00.641,"Okay, what time would that be? Do you want your food? Okay."
00:10:15.990,00:10:17.783,You took too long. I'm in bed.
00:10:18.367,00:10:20.494,Okay. Perfect. I'll get in with you.
00:10:20.703,00:10:22.288,"I'm already asleep, baby."
00:10:23.456,00:10:26.000,I can wake you up. With my penis.
00:10:27.251,00:10:31.922,Not with my penis. You'll be fully awake when it touches-- You know what I mean.
00:10:32.381,00:10:36.719,"I have an early shoot tomorrow and if I don't get eight hours, my face could be puffy."
00:10:37.637,00:10:41.557,-Can I call you in the morning? -Yeah. Sweet dreams... princess.
00:10:46.437,00:10:47.938,With your penis.
00:10:57.615,00:10:59.116,Kellogg's throw...
00:11:00.868,00:11:03.579,It's gonna be tapped and caught! It's caught!
00:11:03.954,00:11:05.122,It's caught!
00:11:09.251,00:11:12.463,"You're up! Oh, my gosh, hi."
00:11:12.546,00:11:14.006,How was your date?
00:11:14.090,00:11:19.762,It was good. He's in my room now drinking Gatorade to recover from our vigorous love-making.
00:11:19.845,00:11:21.263,-Nice. -Really?
00:11:21.347,00:11:23.682,No. I worked late. Didn't make it in time.
00:11:24.058,00:11:24.934,Oh...
00:11:25.017,00:11:27.978,"Dude, loved Kirsten's article about Cleveland fans."
00:11:28.062,00:11:30.147,-I sent it to ten people. -He did.
00:11:30.231,00:11:32.733,Wasn't it awesome? How was the party?
00:11:32.942,00:11:34.026,Gilbert was there.
00:11:34.402,00:11:36.112,You haven't seen him since...
00:11:38.823,00:11:41.492,Since she had sex with him in the bathroom on the Acela?
00:11:41.867,00:11:45.621,-You told him about that? -I could read it from your hand code.
00:11:45.704,00:11:47.123,"I tell him everything, Harp."
00:11:47.206,00:11:52.586,"If we had to avoid every guy she's had sex with on public transportation, we'd never leave the apartment."
00:11:56.298,00:11:58.092,-Yes. I would love that. -Okay.
00:11:58.384,00:11:59.844,-I love you. -I love you so much.
00:12:00.344,00:12:02.471,"-Love you, Mike. -I love you, Harper."
00:12:02.847,00:12:05.850,"He's such a dork. Oh, God. I love him."
00:12:05.933,00:12:08.102,-I love you. I'm gonna go to bed. -Sweet dreams.
00:12:08.185,00:12:09.019,Good night.
00:12:16.110,00:12:17.027,No way!
00:12:19.572,00:12:20.781,I said no. I...
00:12:23.993,00:12:27.830,"Oh, my God. We're not old enough to get married, though."
00:12:27.913,00:12:29.540,What? What?
00:12:30.458,00:12:31.292,I love you.
00:12:31.375,00:12:35.504,Congratulations. Congratulations and I'm so happy for you.
00:12:36.172,00:12:38.174,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:12:38.257,00:12:41.051,"-I love you, Mike! My favorite people. -I love you, Harper!"
00:12:41.969,00:12:44.388,-I was talking to my mom-- -I'm gonna let you do that.
00:12:45.806,00:12:47.975,I just wanna spend my life with you.
00:12:48.350,00:12:50.269,"-Are you kidding me? -Oh, my God."
00:13:13.501,00:13:15.419,What--? How long have you been there?
00:13:18.005,00:13:20.007,You're sitting alone in the dark?
00:13:25.429,00:13:26.805,Do you have a guy over?
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.807,Why do you always assume I have a guy over?
00:13:28.891,00:13:31.018,Not all gay guys are having sex all the time.
00:13:31.435,00:13:33.395,-Don't you have to teach soon? -Can't sleep.
00:13:33.646,00:13:37.358,I'm setting up this art show for a kid living at a homeless shelter with his mom.
00:13:37.441,00:13:40.361,I think he's good enough to get into one of those magnet schools.
00:13:40.444,00:13:44.990,"Today I got a waiter fired for dripping condensation on Rick's pant leg, so..."
00:13:45.074,00:13:46.200,I also feel good.
00:13:46.534,00:13:51.372,"When you get promoted, you can be one of those rich guys that donates supplies."
00:13:51.455,00:13:53.082,So you don't feel so bad.
00:13:53.165,00:13:55.960,We love that guy. We make him a card every year.
00:14:00.214,00:14:02.174,-I'll call you later. -You better.
00:14:06.262,00:14:08.931,"Technically, this time, I did have a guy over."
00:14:26.156,00:14:29.118,Serious? He's jumping associate and right to VP?
00:14:29.201,00:14:31.537,It's Rick. He knows everybody there.
00:14:32.329,00:14:37.167,"If you got his stamp of approval, -it's the golden ticket. -Martin's barely 30."
00:14:37.835,00:14:41.255,"We weren't talking to you, dipshit. Go get Rick a smoothie."
00:14:43.173,00:14:44.800,I don't get Rick smoothies.
00:14:46.302,00:14:47.761,He's on a juice cleanse.
00:14:51.348,00:14:54.310,Paying student athletes is such a hot-button issue.
00:14:54.393,00:14:58.606,You couldn't back off? You're implying we're getting rich off poor kids.
00:14:58.689,00:15:03.110,We're not. We're proving it. Your AD bought a $2-million boat last year.
00:15:03.193,00:15:05.279,Your star player is on food stamps.
00:15:05.362,00:15:09.658,"Kirsten, we are all a big happy family here."
00:15:09.742,00:15:18.500,"We've always liked you. We like what you're doing here, I sent you that article as a courtesy."
00:15:18.584,00:15:22.463,I'm not changing a word. I will send you the link when it is live.
00:15:25.132,00:15:27.676,-That was incredible. You just feel like-- -Ah-ah.
00:15:27.760,00:15:28.761,Where's my lunch?
00:15:28.844,00:15:31.805,-I'm gonna get it. -Tell me something I don't know!
00:15:34.850,00:15:36.060,Here are those ETFs.
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.692,-Intern? -My name's Bo.
00:15:43.984,00:15:46.820,-I don't give a shit. -It has fewer syllables.
00:15:46.904,00:15:49.865,Cover Rick's phone. I'm gonna get lunch. All right?
00:15:49.949,00:15:54.328,"Don't pee, don't zone out, don't sneeze. Just cover his phones, try not to exist."
00:15:55.621,00:15:58.248,"Do not ever, ever connect to his ex-wife."
00:15:59.249,00:16:01.251,-Do I tell him if she calls? -Yeah.
00:16:01.669,00:16:05.923,And slather my dick in ink and use it to write the hieroglyphic for no.
00:16:06.256,00:16:09.760,-I don't know hieroglyphics. -Sorry. That was over the line.
00:16:09.843,00:16:11.470,"But no, don't tell him. Go."
00:16:13.097,00:16:15.683,Do not put on any more clothes. I'm coming over.
00:16:17.184,00:16:18.143,"Oh, shit."
00:16:22.898,00:16:25.442,-What happened? -He's upset about this.
00:16:30.781,00:16:33.075,"Kiki Otis is--? Oh, that makes sense."
00:16:33.575,00:16:35.953,Spiritual commitment ceremony? You showed him this?
00:16:36.036,00:16:37.830,You didn't say anything about his mail.
00:16:38.080,00:16:39.915,-You have no idea what-- -It's non-legal.
00:16:39.999,00:16:41.083,Rick?
00:16:43.002,00:16:45.754,What is this?! Bulletproof glass?!
00:16:48.382,00:16:49.591,Where's pencil-dick?
00:16:49.967,00:16:52.511,-I feel like I'm pencil-dick. -You're fired.
00:16:52.594,00:16:56.515,"Charlie, take his work. I don't wanna see pencil-dick's face again."
00:16:58.809,00:17:02.354,"Pencils can be all lengths and girths, so, the joke's on him."
00:17:04.148,00:17:07.943,"Obviously, you're talented. You don't have to keep convincing us."
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.320,Start by taking out the adjectives.
00:17:10.404,00:17:13.365,-Thank you so much. -Anything for a Dartmouth grad.
00:17:13.449,00:17:15.075,It's late. Get out of here.
00:17:17.703,00:17:19.705,You are so lucky to work for her.
00:17:20.706,00:17:25.044,-I know. -I reached out to her through the alumni magazine and she responded right away.
00:17:25.127,00:17:26.879,Now she's gonna be my mentor.
00:17:27.963,00:17:29.089,She's amazing.
00:17:32.760,00:17:36.805,"Harper, I'm gonna take a nap. So, just wake me up at midnight."
00:17:38.057,00:17:42.144,"Oh, but don't startle me. Play a lullaby then slowly increase the volume."
00:17:44.021,00:17:44.855,Okay.
00:18:00.537,00:18:01.955,-Hello. -Holy shit.
00:18:03.248,00:18:06.001,Here's your stupid interest. There you go.
00:18:06.293,00:18:09.630,What are you still doing here? Are you like a janitor?
00:18:11.173,00:18:12.674,Do I look like a janitor?
00:18:13.801,00:18:14.635,No.
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.137,I work for Kirsten Stevens.
00:18:17.221,00:18:19.807,-Who? -The sports reporter from ESPN.
00:18:20.474,00:18:21.308,Okay.
00:18:21.391,00:18:24.394,She got Roger Goodell to admit he'd seen the video? Don't know her?
00:18:24.478,00:18:31.944,She broke the Penguins concussion protocol story -that literally changed the NHL. -But what are you doing here?
00:18:32.319,00:18:34.196,I can't leave until she leaves.
00:18:34.947,00:18:38.075,"And she never leaves, so, I'm always the last one here."
00:18:38.158,00:18:39.952,"-I'm the last one here. -No, you're not."
00:18:40.035,00:18:43.664,"-Even when Rick's not here, I'm here. -Kirsten keeps a cot in her office."
00:18:43.747,00:18:46.834,Rick keeps a Tempur-Pedic cot in his office. The Tesla of cots.
00:18:47.042,00:18:53.674,Kirsten's like if Miss Piggy and Voldemort had a baby and that baby had low blood sugar and hadn't had sex in a year.
00:18:54.341,00:18:56.927,Don't talk about babies having sex. What's wrong with you?
00:18:58.595,00:18:59.763,Do you want some?
00:19:02.516,00:19:05.894,Rick throws away any liquor that costs less than $200.
00:19:07.229,00:19:08.063,We're at work.
00:19:08.897,00:19:10.691,It's almost midnight. Grow up.
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.819,"It's been so long, I have the tolerance of a fetus."
00:19:19.950,00:19:21.910,The third glass is still bad.
00:19:21.994,00:19:26.665,"If you could watch the ball as well as you're watching my tits, you could have made the playoffs."
00:19:26.748,00:19:29.376,I wanna have an article on her site someday.
00:19:30.002,00:19:31.795,My God. Will you look at this?
00:19:34.173,00:19:37.009,Suze gets invited to cool shit. I miss all of it.
00:19:37.092,00:19:40.304,I miss everything. It's been so long since I've been to a party.
00:19:40.929,00:19:44.474,Or made out with a guy. I don't even remember how. Like my tongue atrophied.
00:19:45.017,00:19:48.729,"When my mom was my age, she had me. I've never had a boyfriend."
00:19:49.688,00:19:51.190,But you're a grown-up.
00:19:51.523,00:19:52.441,Take that back.
00:19:53.317,00:19:57.487,-Not even like a camp boyfriend? -I'm gonna end up like Kirsten.
00:19:58.906,00:20:03.952,Like buying thousand-dollar throw blankets and... sleeping with my computer.
00:20:04.369,00:20:08.373,That's why she's so mean. She's sleeping with a laptop. She needs to get laid.
00:20:09.333,00:20:12.920,"-She needs to be made love to. -Well, Rick needs to get laid."
00:20:14.213,00:20:19.092,The two of them are always in this office. Let's lock them together so they can have sex with each other.
00:20:21.762,00:20:24.598,Think about it. We Cyrano them out of the office.
00:20:24.681,00:20:27.476,"And then when they're boning, we're free."
00:20:27.851,00:20:31.438,"Well, I don't need to be free, I need to be promoted."
00:20:32.105,00:20:37.110,All I care about is that I'm not still an assistant when I'm 28 years old.
00:20:37.194,00:20:38.946,That's when it gets really sad.
00:20:42.074,00:20:44.910,-For you. That's sad for you. -You should leave.
00:20:44.993,00:20:46.453,Bye.
00:20:59.508,00:21:01.051,-I made something. -What--?
00:21:01.343,00:21:03.095,You're so quiet. You move like a Prius.
00:21:03.428,00:21:08.058,-What is that? -It's a spreadsheet of everything I know about Kirsten.
00:21:08.141,00:21:11.603,"-What she likes, doesn't like. -I have no idea what this is for."
00:21:13.814,00:21:14.856,To set them up.
00:21:16.650,00:21:18.026,For our Cyrano.
00:21:18.402,00:21:22.114,-That was a joke. -But it doesn't have to be.
00:21:22.406,00:21:25.742,-What's Rick's favorite food? -The filet from Ai Fiori's.
00:21:26.576,00:21:28.912,-Where will he be at 3? -His son's school play.
00:21:29.454,00:21:33.208,"-Hey, what does he hate? -Geoff spelled with G and sour cream."
00:21:33.292,00:21:35.544,We know everything about them. What they like.
00:21:35.627,00:21:39.715,We control their entire schedule. We are the men behind the curtain.
00:21:40.132,00:21:41.550,We can get them to do anything.
00:21:46.096,00:21:48.181,-This is very thorough. -Thank you.
00:21:49.349,00:21:50.726,-Absolutely not. -What?
00:21:50.809,00:21:52.102,-I thought-- -This is insane.
00:21:52.185,00:21:54.229,I barely have time to do my job.
00:21:55.564,00:21:58.066,"-If Rick found out, he'd fire me. -He'd never find out."
00:22:00.152,00:22:03.530,-This could save us. -I gotta take my girlfriend to lunch.
00:22:04.906,00:22:07.326,-Should I send this to you? -Please don't.
00:22:10.162,00:22:11.121,"Oh, Suze."
00:22:12.122,00:22:12.956,Suze.
00:22:16.501,00:22:17.669,Mm. Mm.
00:22:18.712,00:22:22.674,-I thought we were getting lunch. -Excuse me. Are those seats taken?
00:22:23.175,00:22:24.843,"Yeah, sorry. They're taken."
00:22:25.719,00:22:26.970,"Yeah, I know we were."
00:22:28.263,00:22:31.016,Rick needed me to save the seats. His son's the second lead.
00:22:33.018,00:22:34.936,I thought we could do a theater picnic.
00:22:36.897,00:22:40.317,"Hey, you look amazing. How'd the, uh, thing go this morning?"
00:22:40.734,00:22:43.320,Good. I booked that Old Navy campaign.
00:22:44.071,00:22:45.197,That is incredible.
00:22:46.323,00:22:51.411,"Look, I'm gonna be traveling so much and you're already so busy."
00:22:51.495,00:22:52.871,No. I'm not busy.
00:22:52.954,00:22:56.583,I don't wanna be with a guy saving somebody else's seats.
00:22:57.209,00:23:00.504,"I want the guy whose seats are being saved, you know?"
00:23:06.593,00:23:08.136,I know this is annoying...
00:23:08.595,00:23:13.141,"Ma'am, I would lay my life down for these. If you can't say the same, move on."
00:23:14.226,00:23:15.560,We can make this work.
00:23:16.353,00:23:19.481,I'm about to get promoted. My schedule will be easier.
00:23:20.232,00:23:22.234,Then our seats are gonna be saved.
00:23:22.651,00:23:23.485,I promise.
00:23:25.612,00:23:27.531,-Hey. -Excuse me.
00:23:30.117,00:23:31.535,I like the beard.
00:23:32.619,00:23:34.246,-You got these seats? -Yeah.
00:23:34.329,00:23:37.999,You're gonna have to get me a masseuse. We're three centimeters from the stage.
00:23:39.209,00:23:41.837,What is wrong with you? I'll mess up my neck.
00:23:46.508,00:23:47.551,Oh.
00:23:48.260,00:23:49.511,Lot of hot moms here.
00:23:50.387,00:23:51.888,Holler.
00:23:59.312,00:24:00.147,I'm in.
00:24:01.857,00:24:04.192,"When they're boning, we're free, right?"
00:24:05.944,00:24:07.529,Where could they meet?
00:24:09.156,00:24:11.700,-Rick's usually at the District Club. -Okay.
00:24:11.783,00:24:15.245,-Could she run into him there? -Sure. She can run into him.
00:24:15.537,00:24:20.167,"After she's nominated by two members, one former member, approved by the board."
00:24:20.250,00:24:23.378,"Also has a sex change. Technically, women are allowed."
00:24:23.461,00:24:25.589,-I get it. -Rick cares about winning.
00:24:25.672,00:24:30.802,We just gotta make your boss seem like a business deal or a softball game.
00:24:31.052,00:24:33.763,"All Kirsten cares about is her site, her brand."
00:24:34.389,00:24:37.017,-It's like her baby. -She shouldn't have a real baby.
00:24:37.100,00:24:37.934,How dare you.
00:24:39.477,00:24:41.396,But I do think that's a huge part of it.
00:24:43.481,00:24:48.195,"We need a meet cute. Like, every great romance has a meet cute."
00:24:48.570,00:24:51.781,"Like, getting stuck in an elevator or something, but..."
00:24:53.116,00:24:55.827,-Let's get them stuck in an elevator. -How would we do that?
00:24:56.995,00:24:58.205,You don't know Creepy Tim?
00:24:59.497,00:25:00.749,A succulent.
00:25:03.543,00:25:05.420,Can you grow plants down here?
00:25:05.629,00:25:08.381,"Oh, no. They just slowly die."
00:25:10.759,00:25:11.718,Oh.
00:25:12.552,00:25:16.973,"So, buddy, we wanted to shut down the elevator so two people could fall in love."
00:25:18.225,00:25:19.059,Charlie...
00:25:19.559,00:25:23.313,the only thing I love more than love is love in enclosed spaces.
00:25:24.314,00:25:25.690,And succulents.
00:25:26.524,00:25:30.528,"And you already gave me one of those, so, my answer is yes."
00:25:41.456,00:25:45.335,Falcon One's headed to the Nest. We are a go for Pandora's Box.
00:25:45.418,00:25:47.629,You're not in the Secret Service. Say elevator.
00:25:48.797,00:25:51.216,-We're a go for Pandora's Box. -Copy that.
00:25:55.595,00:25:57.097,"Okay, can you stop at her floor?"
00:26:03.728,00:26:04.729,Say something.
00:26:05.063,00:26:05.897,What?
00:26:06.773,00:26:09.234,Does no one look each other in the eyes anymore?
00:26:11.069,00:26:12.112,Oh.
00:26:13.363,00:26:16.533,"-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who's this guy? -You need to go, sir."
00:26:16.616,00:26:19.369,-Make your way out. -Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
00:26:22.163,00:26:24.332,-What the hell? -What did you think?
00:26:25.625,00:26:28.169,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no."
00:26:29.879,00:26:31.214,Can you start it back up?
00:26:34.259,00:26:38.263,"Thank you, God. I'm extremely claustrophobic. That would've been bad."
00:26:38.346,00:26:39.806,But you work on a truck.
00:26:40.265,00:26:41.641,"Let it go, Rick."
00:26:41.725,00:26:45.103,Your job is to ride elevators. How are you claustrophobic?
00:26:45.937,00:26:49.190,I usually take the stairs. But today was a big day.
00:26:49.649,00:26:51.860,"Okay, let's not make it any worse."
00:26:55.280,00:26:57.407,-Why did you do that? -That wasn't me.
00:26:57.490,00:27:00.076,This might be an actual system malfunction.
00:27:01.119,00:27:01.953,"Oh, my God."
00:27:03.496,00:27:07.876,"This has never happened before. Oh, irony, you fickle queen."
00:27:10.253,00:27:13.256,Yup. This is how it always starts in my nightmare.
00:27:14.049,00:27:17.135,Here we go. All right. We just all need to calm down.
00:27:18.970,00:27:21.431,"-Uh, what are you doing? -What is he doing?"
00:27:22.682,00:27:23.892,Is it getting hot in here?
00:27:26.561,00:27:28.146,"Stop doing that, please. Stop now."
00:27:28.229,00:27:29.981,-I need to be free of this. -Stop that.
00:27:30.440,00:27:31.316,Okay.
00:27:33.109,00:27:35.904,The pants are off. I'm calling the firefighters.
00:27:36.071,00:27:37.697,Don't. I'm calling the real police.
00:27:37.781,00:27:40.825,"Okay, this button is designed for this emergency."
00:27:40.909,00:27:45.705,"You want the emergency response team, not the jackoffs assigned to the Elevator Squad."
00:27:45.789,00:27:47.499,No. Maybe we can make a rope.
00:27:47.582,00:27:49.918,You're not gonna get service. It's already ringing.
00:27:51.169,00:27:58.426,"-Excuse me. -If we press it at the same time, I gotta pee. I'm gonna pee."
00:27:58.676,00:28:00.720,"If you pee, I will end your life."
00:28:00.804,00:28:04.391,Stress incontinence. That is a real condition and you are not helping.
00:28:04.808,00:28:06.476,I'm gonna listen to my body.
00:28:06.976,00:28:07.811,Oh.
00:28:10.063,00:28:10.897,Pee.
00:28:13.066,00:28:17.195,-Do not pee in there. Do not pee in the-- -It's too late. I'm dripping.
00:28:27.247,00:28:28.540,Shh.
00:28:33.837,00:28:35.296,Ah.
00:28:45.056,00:28:45.974,Hello.
00:28:47.308,00:28:51.187,"I'm not great at reading rooms, but I can tell that was a success."
00:28:54.190,00:28:55.650,It was okay.
00:28:57.277,00:28:58.403,-Are you kidding? -Hmm?
00:28:58.945,00:29:01.406,That was a disaster. They hate each other.
00:29:01.489,00:29:04.826,"Hate, we can work with. Hate is not the opposite of love."
00:29:04.909,00:29:06.703,Know what the opposite of love is?
00:29:06.786,00:29:08.121,-Ice. -Indifference.
00:29:13.752,00:29:16.337,-Uh... -People call me Creepy Tim?
00:29:17.422,00:29:18.506,No.
00:29:19.466,00:29:20.300,I love it.
00:29:20.925,00:29:26.681,"Your dry cleaning's in the car, and I forwarded you Jeff's itinerary for the Simone Biles profile."
00:29:28.516,00:29:29.392,Oh.
00:29:29.809,00:29:36.107,"And, also, apparently some guy you were stuck in the elevator with asked security for your contact info."
00:29:37.776,00:29:39.778,-Was it the delivery man? -No.
00:29:40.487,00:29:42.447,"Um, some big shot in the building."
00:29:44.157,00:29:46.034,I guess he has a crush on you.
00:29:47.827,00:29:51.915,"But don't worry, I told them we do not give out your number, okay?"
00:29:56.586,00:30:00.965,I heard you got stuck in an elevator with that sports reporter. Kirsten...?
00:30:01.049,00:30:04.385,Kirsten Stevens. I knew I recognized her from somewhere.
00:30:04.469,00:30:05.845,Kirsten Stevens.
00:30:06.513,00:30:09.933,I think Mark Cuban is thinking about investing in her site.
00:30:13.686,00:30:14.604,Hmm.
00:30:21.152,00:30:22.612,I did it. What now?
00:30:24.614,00:30:28.076,"No, he watches from the bleachers like a peasant. He does."
00:30:35.959,00:30:36.960,"Hi, I'm so sorry."
00:30:37.043,00:30:44.634,"So sorry. I got here so early that I thought I had time to dick around, so I went there, lost track of time -and was late. -That's the dumbest thing I've heard."
00:30:44.717,00:30:46.678,-That is not a real thing. -It is.
00:30:46.803,00:30:49.722,It's the over-dick-around thing. I over-dicked it.
00:30:50.098,00:30:53.434,-Why are you wearing that? -I'm going to a baseball game.
00:30:54.686,00:30:56.187,Why are you wearing that?
00:30:56.396,00:30:59.274,I'm not on the team. Why would I wear the jersey?
00:30:59.357,00:31:02.735,-I don't wear scrubs to the doctor's. -I'll get nachos.
00:31:04.988,00:31:06.197,I've made a mistake.
00:31:25.383,00:31:26.217,the people...
00:31:27.552,00:31:30.847,in these two seats right here to make out.
00:31:30.930,00:31:37.645,-What do they look like? -One is a beautiful woman with dark hair and a fierceness that's both scary and inspiring.
00:31:39.522,00:31:40.648,The other is a guy.
00:31:41.608,00:31:43.943,-You know I can make this happen. -Good.
00:31:46.571,00:31:50.408,Yankees' 24-year-old Dominican pitcher is on the mound to start.
00:31:51.242,00:31:53.912,"So, Rick's here. If you see the..."
00:31:54.370,00:31:57.790,-You see the U? He's right above. -Do you have a telescope so I can see him?
00:31:58.207,00:32:01.210,-Are seats this far back legal? -These are the best.
00:32:01.294,00:32:04.672,There's a community here. And you can see the whole field.
00:32:05.506,00:32:06.716,And there's Dennis.
00:32:07.050,00:32:08.843,"Hi, sweetheart. How you doing?"
00:32:09.135,00:32:12.555,Dennis introduced me to the Gerilympics. He's a heavy weightlifting champ.
00:32:13.514,00:32:17.477,"-What does he bench, negative 10? -I heard that, you little pissant."
00:32:17.560,00:32:18.686,"I'm old, not deaf."
00:32:19.145,00:32:22.357,"-Is that your boyfriend? -Absolutely not, Dennis."
00:32:22.982,00:32:23.816,Good.
00:32:32.283,00:32:35.453,I'm gonna take a picture of you and post it on Tinder.
00:32:36.329,00:32:38.748,"You know, guys love girls who like sports."
00:32:39.791,00:32:41.501,-Are you kidding me? -They do.
00:32:42.001,00:32:48.257,They think they like girls liking sports. They like a girl in a tight sports jersey serving wings and getting terms wrong.
00:32:48.341,00:32:50.385,Guys like girls who like guys who like sports.
00:32:50.468,00:32:52.095,-Got it? Oh! -Kirsten's here!
00:33:05.525,00:33:07.443,"-Hey. -Oh, hi."
00:33:09.529,00:33:11.948,-This is a weird coincidence. -Here we go.
00:33:13.199,00:33:16.619,-I hope you took the stairs. -How else would I get here?
00:33:17.745,00:33:20.540,"No, I mean, because nobody-- Nobody peed."
00:33:21.958,00:33:23.501,-You know? -Ah. Yes.
00:33:24.210,00:33:25.044,Yeah.
00:33:27.797,00:33:31.134,"-You here by yourself? -Uh, I'm supposed to meet a colleague."
00:33:31.217,00:33:34.595,"Yeah, me, too. An investor. I guess he's stuck in traffic."
00:33:37.098,00:33:41.310,-You know his slider drops like that! -Be elite! Come on!
00:33:45.565,00:33:48.359,You're welcome to take this seat until my colleague gets here.
00:33:48.860,00:33:50.403,It's the best seat in the stadium.
00:33:51.654,00:33:54.282,"Actually, it's just the most expensive seat."
00:33:54.365,00:33:56.784,"From where I'm sitting, you hear both coaches better."
00:33:57.410,00:34:00.872,But you're welcome to sit here until my colleague arrives.
00:34:06.669,00:34:07.503,Thank you.
00:34:09.422,00:34:13.468,"Wait. Oh, yeah! That is what I'm talking about!"
00:34:17.972,00:34:19.432,-It's happening. -Come on.
00:34:21.100,00:34:25.021,All right. It's Kirsten and Rick! I told you he'd find them.
00:34:25.104,00:34:26.606,All right. Come on.
00:34:26.689,00:34:27.523,Come on.
00:34:34.489,00:34:36.699,-They're not gonna kiss. -What?
00:34:38.659,00:34:39.786,Share the love.
00:34:41.496,00:34:43.706,They were nervous. If they gave them more time...
00:34:43.790,00:34:44.749,"I know, I know."
00:34:48.836,00:34:50.129,Boo!
00:34:53.966,00:34:55.176,What's your problem?
00:34:55.259,00:34:57.512,-Who are you? -For a different reason.
00:35:10.024,00:35:13.653,"No, okay. Oh, kiss, kiss. It's the law!"
00:35:20.076,00:35:22.495,"-Oh, my God. Why? -I don't know."
00:35:22.578,00:35:25.998,Should we send them popcorn or something?
00:35:30.545,00:35:32.421,-Come on. Come on. -Come on.
00:35:35.925,00:35:37.385,"Kiss, kiss, kiss."
00:35:37.468,00:35:40.888,"-Kiss, kiss, kiss. -All right."
00:35:40.972,00:35:42.473,"Kiss, kiss, kiss."
00:35:51.691,00:35:53.025,-Yeah! -Yes!
00:35:56.362,00:35:57.488,We have no e-mails.
00:35:58.239,00:36:01.534,"Well, it's hard to bark orders when your tongue is down someone's throat."
00:36:01.617,00:36:04.662,-That's true. -We're free. The world's our oyster.
00:36:04.745,00:36:07.415,"-We're free. Have fun with Suze. -You, too."
00:36:09.125,00:36:11.169,-Are you taking the--? -You taking the 4?
00:36:11.711,00:36:13.296,Kind of wasted that high-five.
00:36:33.774,00:36:34.609,Hello.
00:36:35.818,00:36:37.737,Any sports moments make you cry?
00:36:52.376,00:36:53.211,Yeah.
00:36:54.086,00:36:56.714,"Oh, my goodness. Who are you?"
00:36:59.050,00:37:04.972,"I'm sorry, Kirsten, the 3 train stalled, then there was a new barista, and she didn't know the milk your coffee-- She didn't..."
00:37:12.188,00:37:16.776,What if a psychopath saw them on the Kiss Cam and followed them home and murdered them?
00:37:17.693,00:37:19.654,"Legally, where are we in that scenario?"
00:37:19.737,00:37:25.952,"Please, I have watched enough Law &amp; Order to know that we are absolutely, -100 percent, no doubt about it-- -Morning."
00:37:26.494,00:37:29.455,I could use some coffee. You mind getting me a flat white?
00:37:30.414,00:37:31.249,Would I mind?
00:37:32.833,00:37:33.709,It'd be my honor.
00:37:35.127,00:37:36.212,"Harper, my office."
00:37:48.307,00:37:51.602,-I spent the night with a man. -A man. You spent the night with-- Hmm?
00:37:51.686,00:37:55.606,"Oh, wow, that's amazing. You get it, girl."
00:37:55.690,00:37:59.026,We did not sleep together. We did everything but.
00:37:59.902,00:38:03.781,I'm not the kind of person who sleeps with people on the first date anymore.
00:38:04.448,00:38:06.158,-Right. -I guess it had been a while.
00:38:06.242,00:38:07.368,Longer than I realized.
00:38:08.828,00:38:10.955,I don't think they should hear that.
00:38:13.457,00:38:15.042,The waiting was almost tantric.
00:38:16.127,00:38:16.961,What?
00:38:18.129,00:38:23.009,"Even when he was being gentle, I could sense a possibility of strength in his touch."
00:38:23.092,00:38:27.847,Kind of like when Koko was petting that tiny kitten.
00:38:28.597,00:38:32.476,"Just like petting it, petting it, petting it."
00:38:40.109,00:38:41.027,Let's bullhorn.
00:38:46.240,00:38:50.077,"-Okay, tell me something I don't know. -Yeah, I did not know that."
00:38:51.329,00:38:54.874,"-Charlie, Kirsten just left. -So did Rick."
00:38:55.458,00:38:56.584,It's daylight.
00:38:56.667,00:39:02.590,"I know. Okay. I'm getting out of here before Kirsten comes back, and this was all some terrible prank."
00:39:03.341,00:39:08.804,"I have a date with some guy that I messaged last night, -and we're gonna go mini-golfing. -That's a terrible idea."
00:39:08.888,00:39:10.181,Why is that a terrible idea?
00:39:10.264,00:39:12.266,You have Dave Matthews' concentration face.
00:39:12.350,00:39:15.144,"-No, I don't. -Mm, I saw you write cursive one time."
00:39:16.187,00:39:18.647,"Go, have fun. Let him win a few holes."
00:39:19.148,00:39:21.442,Excuse me. I only have one hole.
00:39:21.525,00:39:24.403,"-Oh, my God. I meant at golf. -So did I."
00:39:28.657,00:39:31.035,"Hey, you're home before me. Did you quit?"
00:39:31.118,00:39:33.037,"No, I got off early."
00:39:33.996,00:39:35.414,Making Suze some dinner.
00:39:36.832,00:39:40.336,"So, uh, Suze is coming over. That's nice."
00:39:41.128,00:39:43.506,Why did you say it like that? Why'd your voice go up?
00:39:43.589,00:39:46.342,"'Cause, you know, she, uh... She sucks."
00:39:47.218,00:39:51.138,"-What? -If you take away her face and her boobs, you realize she's not saying anything."
00:39:51.806,00:39:55.267,That's the most heterophobic thing I've ever heard. You just don't know her.
00:39:55.351,00:39:58.396,"-How well do you know her? -I know everything about Suze, all right?"
00:39:58.479,00:40:00.773,-We talk all the time. I text her all day. -Like?
00:40:01.273,00:40:05.528,She's from Puerto Rico. She's a model. She uses La Mer products.
00:40:06.112,00:40:08.322,She doesn't like dairy. There you go.
00:40:08.406,00:40:13.119,"All right. Well, what do you do if you wanna have an intimate, meaningful conversation with somebody?"
00:40:13.786,00:40:15.621,-I talk to you. -That's not what I'm for.
00:40:15.704,00:40:18.332,That's what your girlfriend's for. To be your best friend.
00:40:18.416,00:40:21.877,You're my best friend. I've never pooped at her apartment.
00:40:21.961,00:40:25.381,Whose fault is that? Should've did that the first date. Mark your territory.
00:40:29.802,00:40:31.846,but Gronk got wasted at a Christmas party.
00:40:36.725,00:40:40.354,-I love Kirsten Stevens. So cool. -Yeah.
00:40:40.729,00:40:46.944,"-Wait, what's she like? -She's-- -Well, she's great. She's great, really. -Yeah?"
00:40:47.027,00:40:50.197,She's so smart and hard-working. Kind of inspiring.
00:40:50.281,00:40:52.825,-Inspiring? Okay. -Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:52.908,00:40:54.160,-Here we go. -Let's do this.
00:41:02.626,00:41:05.087,-That didn't go. -You letting me win to boost my ego?
00:41:05.171,00:41:09.091,I wanna destroy you. I'm trying not to make my concentration face.
00:41:09.175,00:41:14.013,"Oh, no. Why don't I just stand behind you, and you can make whatever face you want."
00:41:14.096,00:41:16.140,-Okay. Okay. -Okay. Cool. Yeah.
00:41:24.356,00:41:28.903,"-Well-- -I hope that was your golf club, because it felt extremely small."
00:41:45.085,00:41:46.712,-Harper? -Mm-hm?
00:41:46.795,00:41:50.132,My phone is broken. Voice messages aren't coming through.
00:41:51.008,00:41:52.051,"Oh, really?"
00:41:53.594,00:41:57.389,-Mm-mm. It works fine. -There is something wrong with it!
00:42:03.062,00:42:04.230,Oh.
00:42:05.064,00:42:06.106,Okay.
00:42:20.329,00:42:22.623,-You know what's crazy? -I don't care.
00:42:22.706,00:42:25.751,-Just how different dating is nowadays. -Why are you still talking?
00:42:26.418,00:42:31.423,"You know, you used to have to wait three days to call, but now women think the longer you take..."
00:42:34.593,00:42:36.303,the smaller your penis.
00:42:41.016,00:42:41.850,Get out.
00:42:44.895,00:42:46.814,-This is an elevator. -Get out.
00:42:48.524,00:42:49.358,I've got it.
00:42:50.818,00:42:52.278,"Hey, there."
00:42:53.237,00:42:54.488,Please hold for Rick.
00:43:15.426,00:43:20.097,"I mean, if I see any hair on a woman, I'm out. See you."
00:43:23.392,00:43:25.853,-So? -Kirsten needs to get a bikini wax.
00:43:30.024,00:43:33.527,Just tell her to get one. You're girls. You talk about that.
00:43:35.070,00:43:44.955,"Oh, right. I forgot that every morning I walk in, I hand her her latte, and then we talk about merkins and the cyclical popularity of the full bush."
00:43:45.039,00:43:47.416,-What's a merkin? -It's a pubic hair wig.
00:43:48.375,00:43:49.918,A wig for the pube region.
00:43:50.544,00:43:53.172,"You know, I miss the time when I didn't know what that was."
00:43:53.839,00:43:54.673,There we go.
00:43:55.758,00:43:59.136,"Oh, uh, okay. Tomorrow morning, you have that salon appointment."
00:43:59.219,00:44:03.140,"-What? What salon appointment? -I mean, the one for the bikini wax."
00:44:03.932,00:44:07.645,"-Bikini wax, when did I make that? -You made that ages ago."
00:44:08.520,00:44:10.481,"Just like an annual checkup, general upkeep."
00:44:12.024,00:44:14.818,-What salon? -The one you told me to make it at.
00:44:15.194,00:44:18.364,-Exhale? -Bliss-- Exhale.
00:44:20.741,00:44:23.744,"She gonna clear out the brush, the bush brush."
00:44:23.827,00:44:27.665,Clear out the bush and brush and just make it as smooth as a baby.
00:44:28.332,00:44:30.376,To have a baby. You don't need one of those.
00:44:30.459,00:44:32.252,The babies or the bush or the brush.
00:44:34.338,00:44:35.297,I have so many calls.
00:44:37.091,00:44:45.641,"But if we hadn't have intervened, Rick would have called her too late, and Kirsten's lack of waxing would have turned him off, and there would have never been a second date."
00:44:46.308,00:44:54.191,"-Okay. -We can't just kick them out of the nest, because they're baby birds, and they are careening to their death."
00:44:54.900,00:44:58.445,-We have to actually Cyrano them. Yeah. -Absolutely. Totally.
00:44:59.196,00:45:01.907,"I mean, that's what we've been doing up to now."
00:45:01.990,00:45:05.369,"-That's what we should continue to do. -You know what Cyrano means, right?"
00:45:05.452,00:45:06.829,"Yeah, I'm not an idiot."
00:45:08.080,00:45:08.997,"So, what is it?"
00:45:11.125,00:45:19.341,"It's when-- So, if like two assistants were setting up their boss-- -I don't know what Cyrano is. I know. -You don't know it. I've said it 14 times."
00:45:21.677,00:45:29.977,"-and then it was too late to ask. -Okay. It's when a nerdy guy helps a handsome guy date the girl that he loves by telling him what to say, what to do."
00:45:30.060,00:45:33.564,That is not what we're doing. We're full-on Parent Trapping.
00:45:33.647,00:45:38.777,"-No, we're not. -I've seen the Lindsay Lohan classic enough times to know that we're Parent Trapping hard."
00:45:38.861,00:45:43.323,"No, Charlie, the point is, we can't just set them up, we have to help them keep dating."
00:46:14.646,00:46:17.316,"Yes, that one. He's an ass man."
00:46:19.860,00:46:22.529,Mr. Otis said you can wait in the lobby.
00:46:29.786,00:46:31.038,Don't walk like that.
00:46:33.707,00:46:36.210,There are two kinds of compliments to give a woman.
00:46:36.293,00:46:42.508,"The things she thinks about herself but needs confirmed, and the thing she doesn't think anybody notices about her."
00:46:43.175,00:46:44.885,The second kind matters more.
00:46:52.726,00:46:55.896,Charlie. I'm gonna be in late tomorrow.
00:47:01.610,00:47:03.028,I'm taking the rest of the day.
00:47:13.747,00:47:14.831,Ooh.
00:47:49.199,00:47:51.535,I took a nap today. A nap.
00:47:52.327,00:47:54.663,-Are you ready to order yet? -Not yet.
00:47:55.539,00:47:58.458,-But I'd love some more chips. -Sure.
00:48:00.627,00:48:03.630,"Naps are great. But I got a bigger situation on my hands, Charlie."
00:48:04.423,00:48:08.218,Becca's engagement party is next weekend. I need to guarantee that I can be there.
00:48:08.302,00:48:11.388,"It's really important for me, okay? Here's my plan."
00:48:11.888,00:48:17.019,Get Rick to invite Kirsten on a romantic weekend getaway trip to Nantucket.
00:48:17.102,00:48:24.735,"There's a wine festival next weekend, and you're gonna plant all the information and make Rick think that he thought of it, but he didn't, we did."
00:48:24.818,00:48:26.320,-Okay? -Okay.
00:48:26.403,00:48:32.534,"And they're gonna be marooned on an island with limited cell service, which means you and I will have an entire weekend to ourselves."
00:48:32.618,00:48:36.997,Perfect. Suze's modeling agency is throwing this fancy party next Saturday.
00:48:37.080,00:48:39.249,"I'll show up, throw out pheromones."
00:48:39.333,00:48:43.086,-Let everyone know she's got a boyfriend. -Don't say the word pheromones around me.
00:48:43.170,00:48:49.551,"I'm sorry. I meant, uh, chemicals secreted in my sweat to attract females -to my throbbing DNA. -No, no."
00:48:53.096,00:48:55.390,Is that--? What--? Can you just--?
00:48:55.974,00:48:58.185,You should probably be easier on the ha ha has.
00:48:58.268,00:48:59.144,Hmm?
00:48:59.936,00:49:03.440,"I mean, you find him humorous. You're not a psychotic clown."
00:49:03.523,00:49:05.609,"Psychotic clown, what are you talking about?"
00:49:05.692,00:49:09.029,"If you like Golf Guy, you'll go out with three other guys this week."
00:49:12.616,00:49:17.913,"If you had three salamanders, you played with each of them every day, and they'd live for years."
00:49:18.538,00:49:25.796,"But when you had one salamander, and you held it and you loved it, and you played with it, and it just died immediately."
00:49:26.797,00:49:27.631,No.
00:49:28.256,00:49:30.300,"Well, men are kind of like that."
00:49:30.926,00:49:40.519,"You put too much focus on him, he can sense it, then you're gonna accidentally kill him. Then you gotta hide him in your drawer -so your mom doesn't find out. -I like my one salamander."
00:49:40.936,00:49:42.604,"Okay, let's get out of here."
00:49:43.522,00:49:46.817,-Wait. We haven't even ordered yet. -Hello? No. I better get out of here.
00:49:46.900,00:49:49.111,-It's an emergency. -What?
00:49:53.323,00:49:59.871,"for my dinner at this very nice restaurant, but I guess I'll just rush straight to the hospital."
00:49:59.955,00:50:02.082,-Thank you. -An emergency.
00:50:03.083,00:50:05.419,"Oh, my God, the whole leg?"
00:50:11.842,00:50:15.345,"It's not legally a crime, but we both know this isn't right."
00:50:25.313,00:50:29.401,"Why do I only have a 2D printer? What am I, a caveman?"
00:50:30.360,00:50:34.156,There's too much paper here! This is the digital age!
00:50:39.161,00:50:41.580,"I'll have you know, my tongue is no longer atrophied."
00:50:41.663,00:50:48.920,"-Code red, code black, code-- Shit. -Code red, I can't tell what that means, I won't go out of town."
00:50:49.004,00:50:52.048,Make sure they know the office has to be open all weekend.
00:50:52.132,00:50:52.966,"Um, of course."
00:50:54.342,00:50:57.262,-Is everything okay? -Obviously. Why would you ask me that?
00:50:57.345,00:50:58.305,"Well, no reason."
00:51:00.015,00:51:04.853,I am a successful woman. I don't need to travel with a pathetic man-child who can't even feed himself.
00:51:04.936,00:51:05.979,Of course not.
00:51:08.231,00:51:13.361,Here's a riddle. Would you tell me you love Korean barbecue if you've never had it and didn't know what it was?
00:51:13.445,00:51:14.446,No.
00:51:14.529,00:51:23.997,"And if we went there, would you refuse to let me explain how it works, eat raw meat, rather than admit you're wrong, and blame me when you threw it up on a hot grill?"
00:51:24.080,00:51:24.915,Never.
00:51:25.791,00:51:27.542,"Kirsten, do you want your--? No, okay."
00:51:29.669,00:51:33.924,A lot of men proposed to me in my 20s. I could be thrice divorced by now.
00:51:34.674,00:51:40.305,But I'm not gonna pretend to let him teach me about how the world works just so he can get it up!
00:51:41.640,00:51:42.641,He's such a jerk.
00:51:45.227,00:51:49.147,I'm worried that your abrasiveness and general demeanor will hinder you in the workplace.
00:51:51.566,00:52:05.539,"You put a plate full of raw beef in front of me, I'm sorry if I expect my food to be properly cooked whilst I sit in a restaurant. What am I, a chef? Uh-uh."
00:52:06.039,00:52:09.251,-Do I got a Michelin star? -You could if you wanted to.
00:52:09.584,00:52:12.629,She did this shit on purpose to make me look stupid.
00:52:13.421,00:52:14.589,This was a power play.
00:52:15.257,00:52:17.634,I don't think she tried to power play.
00:52:17.717,00:52:20.720,Can't get the image of barbecued vomit out of my head now.
00:52:22.848,00:52:25.976,This shitty computer isn't taking my password.
00:52:28.603,00:52:30.564,-That's my-- -Take my password!
00:52:35.151,00:52:36.027,That's my laptop.
00:52:37.612,00:52:38.947,Bring me my laptop.
00:52:43.118,00:52:45.036,How could you let them pick the restaurant?
00:52:45.120,00:52:47.539,"-It was your turn to choose. -No, you chose last time."
00:52:48.915,00:52:49.749,Damn it.
00:52:51.001,00:52:52.544,Rick is worse than before.
00:52:52.627,00:52:54.629,-He tried to fire a mailman today. -My God.
00:52:54.713,00:52:58.341,-Mailmen work for the U.S. government. -Get them together before they kill us.
00:52:58.425,00:53:01.303,I can feel it in my bones that Kirsten is capable of murder.
00:53:06.266,00:53:08.059,It's your turn to figure something out.
00:53:09.102,00:53:11.396,Why isn't there anything in my calendar at 2 p.m.?
00:53:11.479,00:53:13.690,You know I need a hard out after family events.
00:53:13.773,00:53:16.818,"Oh, my. I'm so sorry. I didn't know that your lunch was with family."
00:53:16.902,00:53:23.158,"-I'll figure it out right now. -If I pay you to make my life easier, but instead, you make it harder, you're useless to me."
00:53:23.241,00:53:24.326,Do you understand?
00:53:29.956,00:53:33.126,"So, bad news is, Kirsten ripped me a new one."
00:53:33.668,00:53:36.296,Good news is I now have time to see Golf Guy.
00:53:36.379,00:53:39.090,-Mm. -What is this? Charlie?
00:53:40.050,00:53:44.971,"-Oh, my God. -This is Rick's son's science project."
00:53:46.806,00:53:50.393,"Life gave me lemons, and I used it to battery-power lemonade."
00:53:50.894,00:53:52.979,Can you... fix it?
00:53:55.190,00:53:58.610,"No. It was a masterpiece, and now he's not even getting a ribbon."
00:54:00.320,00:54:03.156,"Go, get out of here. Save yourself."
00:54:05.116,00:54:07.285,-Good luck. -Thank you.
00:54:12.999,00:54:15.293,We need a new project. Whole new thing.
00:54:16.294,00:54:18.129,-Yeah. -What about Golf Guy?
00:54:18.505,00:54:21.216,I don't wanna squeeze my salamander too hard.
00:54:22.550,00:54:26.304,I honestly did not know that someone could do this to lemons with their bare hands.
00:54:31.851,00:54:36.022,"Imagine if a duck were on meth, it was like, Hey, Charlie. Charlie."
00:54:36.106,00:54:39.359,-Sounded like that duck. -Why do you work for this guy?
00:54:39.734,00:54:43.446,-Why don't you just... quit? -Are you insane?
00:54:43.863,00:54:46.658,I've spent three years doing every shit errand imaginable.
00:54:47.742,00:54:48.576,Can't quit.
00:54:49.828,00:54:52.789,"I'd have to start all over, and all of this would've been a waste."
00:54:53.331,00:55:00.797,"Plus, Rick is the most respected VC of all time, so if he makes me an analyst, -I can get a job anywhere. -But do you like the actual work?"
00:55:00.880,00:55:03.800,Nobody likes the actual work. That's the job.
00:55:03.883,00:55:05.927,Do the best one where you make the most money.
00:55:06.011,00:55:06.845,Hmm.
00:55:12.100,00:55:13.685,"Okay, why do you work for Kirsten?"
00:55:14.352,00:55:21.234,"I work for Kirsten because I wanna write the articles that made me cry when I was a little girl, and Kirsten's the best sports journalist there is."
00:55:22.402,00:55:24.029,"Well, has she read any of your stuff?"
00:55:24.696,00:55:27.949,I haven't written anything or finished writing anything.
00:55:28.992,00:55:34.873,"My days are so long and so exhausting it's like when I have time, everything I write is... bad."
00:55:35.749,00:55:38.334,-That is probably not true. -It is true.
00:55:38.418,00:55:49.471,"I think I wanted to impress her and I wanted her to like me, so, it's just like, I worked so hard at being this great assistant and making sure she was happy that..."
00:55:51.056,00:55:55.602,"I don't know, feels like I might have lost any writing skill I ever had."
00:55:56.519,00:55:59.689,"Well, that is definitely not true."
00:56:01.983,00:56:03.318,You're a terrible assistant.
00:56:07.030,00:56:08.490,Can you pass me a few of those?
00:56:15.371,00:56:16.790,-You ready? -I'm ready.
00:56:19.459,00:56:21.127,-What? -Yeah.
00:56:21.211,00:56:23.379,Holy shit. How does that work?
00:56:23.463,00:56:28.968,"Well, the bonds in the milk connect with the DNA in the-- I have no idea. I'm not a scientist."
00:56:33.807,00:56:36.935,All the supplies are in the bag. Feels like a winner.
00:56:37.852,00:56:39.813,This isn't as good as the lemons.
00:56:50.824,00:56:57.747,"but given the fact that we did that in the night, Yo!"
00:56:57.831,00:57:00.375,"-Oh, my God. I think Rick's drunk. -What?"
00:57:02.085,00:57:05.004,I've never seen him drunk before. He's violent when he's sober.
00:57:13.012,00:57:14.931,"-Yeah. -Do it with me, white boy."
00:57:17.308,00:57:20.228,"Yeah. Get over here, you dig it? Come on, man."
00:57:21.771,00:57:22.814,Come on.
00:57:25.483,00:57:26.359,Huh!
00:57:27.527,00:57:28.528,You don't know that shit.
00:57:31.072,00:57:31.948,Um...
00:57:35.243,00:57:36.327,You're a good guy.
00:57:39.581,00:57:40.582,Do you know that?
00:57:42.459,00:57:44.335,-For real. -What?
00:57:49.591,00:57:50.800,I appreciate you.
00:57:52.677,00:57:54.929,And I should tell you that more often.
00:58:00.477,00:58:03.980,Good idea. Let's have another drink.
00:58:08.651,00:58:11.571,"-Okay. -Oh, no. No, no, no. I got it."
00:58:18.661,00:58:20.288,"I hate losing, Charlie."
00:58:22.373,00:58:24.000,And she thinks I'm a loser.
00:58:25.210,00:58:26.377,What should I do?
00:58:30.173,00:58:31.132,You're a person.
00:58:32.425,00:58:33.510,What would you do?
00:58:37.972,00:58:40.475,-Apologize. -No. Next.
00:58:41.267,00:58:44.479,Tell her she's good at her job. Tell her you respect what she does.
00:58:46.397,00:58:47.607,Just tell her you see her.
00:58:49.108,00:58:49.984,Ew.
00:58:52.153,00:58:55.031,-What does that even mean? -I don't know.
00:58:57.075,00:59:01.079,I think maybe it's just... Maybe it's just what I'd wanna hear.
00:59:04.832,00:59:05.792,Hmm?
00:59:20.348,00:59:21.391,Hey.
00:59:25.895,00:59:26.729,I see you.
00:59:28.940,00:59:31.734,What? What does that even mean?
00:59:32.443,00:59:33.278,I see you.
00:59:33.945,00:59:37.657,"I see you, like-- I see you."
00:59:45.039,00:59:48.042,-Oh. Lock the door. -Mm-hm.
00:59:51.379,00:59:52.380,"Yes, ma'am."
00:59:53.506,00:59:55.133,I meant that as a joke.
00:59:56.926,00:59:57.969,You're the boss.
01:00:10.607,01:00:11.441,Rick.
01:00:26.080,01:00:28.374,I need it to look like a massacre at a flower shop.
01:00:28.958,01:00:35.298,"Nantucket is a go. They land in an hour, I put the champagne -on Rick's credit card. Here you go. -Hotel room is all set."
01:00:35.840,01:00:38.760,"-It's about to be Boner City in there. -Wow, okay."
01:00:39.302,01:00:42.138,Someone say Boner City? Frigging love that place.
01:00:42.805,01:00:44.932,"Harper, this is Duncan. My roommate."
01:00:45.016,01:00:47.101,He's a teacher at a middle school in the Bronx.
01:00:47.185,01:00:49.604,"But he's gay, so, keep your ovaries in your pants."
01:00:53.483,01:00:56.653,-Why are you dressed like that? -For Becca's engagement party tonight.
01:00:57.820,01:01:00.239,What are you wearing? Where are the rest of your shorts?
01:01:01.157,01:01:04.577,"These are cool, all right? Suze likes short shorts on guys."
01:01:07.205,01:01:09.791,"You know what, stop it. You're not friends."
01:01:09.874,01:01:12.210,-I feel like we're becoming friends. -We're friends.
01:01:12.293,01:01:14.712,-Do you wanna come to this party? -I don't think so.
01:01:14.796,01:01:17.256,I gotta finish writing this article to distract myself.
01:01:17.340,01:01:18.675,Distract yourself from what?
01:01:18.758,01:01:21.010,The fact that Golf Guy hasn't called me in a few days.
01:01:21.678,01:01:26.641,"-Like zero contact? -Yeah, but he'll call me soon, 'cause he said he was gonna come to Becca's party tonight."
01:01:27.558,01:01:30.561,-Whatever. It's not like I care. -It's gonna be fun.
01:01:32.522,01:01:35.733,-You've convinced me. I'll be there. -Perfect. She's my plus one.
01:01:35.817,01:01:39.320,You're my plus one. I'm Suze's plus one. You're a plus two.
01:01:39.404,01:01:41.656,"-So, she's my plus three. -I'm his plus three."
01:01:41.739,01:01:42.573,What?
01:01:48.871,01:01:50.164,"-Yes! -Oh, my God."
01:01:52.792,01:01:57.296,"Everybody's so tan. Oh, my goodness. Look at you. You look so pretty."
01:01:58.089,01:01:59.632,"Duncan, you know Suze."
01:01:59.716,01:02:02.885,"I heard you were coming, and I still showed up, so..."
01:02:03.386,01:02:05.179,-Harper. -I'm Harper.
01:02:06.764,01:02:09.851,-How are you doing this? -I get you every time. Yeah.
01:02:09.934,01:02:13.229,Stop. Stop hugging each other. You are not friends.
01:02:13.312,01:02:14.814,We're killing it.
01:02:21.446,01:02:22.739,Do you guys know each other?
01:02:22.822,01:02:26.159,It's like Battle of the Bulge over here. It's a war zone.
01:02:37.044,01:02:41.632,"-Hey, Charlie. -He's not gonna call you, -and it's not a big deal. -I slept with him."
01:02:41.716,01:02:44.594,"I don't do that with many people. Thanks, Duncan."
01:02:44.677,01:02:47.513,First guy I ever slept with came out while he was inside of me.
01:02:47.889,01:02:49.932,I hate to be the one that has to explain this.
01:02:50.016,01:02:53.311,"-That's actually how sex works. -That's not what she's talking about, bro."
01:02:53.436,01:02:56.481,-He came out as a gay man. -While he was inside you?
01:02:57.023,01:03:00.401,"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like you don't really know until you tried it."
01:03:00.485,01:03:03.738,"And then, once you tried it, you really know."
01:03:04.197,01:03:05.031,Wow.
01:03:05.114,01:03:08.409,"Well, you know what? Golf Guy wasn't like that."
01:03:09.869,01:03:11.078,He was perfect.
01:03:11.162,01:03:14.081,I think your bar for perfect is really low.
01:03:14.665,01:03:17.919,Can we stop? We're gonna play a game called hard to get.
01:03:18.503,01:03:22.131,Hard to get? Makes no sense. It's evolutionarily unsound.
01:03:22.507,01:03:25.510,"Why would a caveman want a cavewoman who was like, Go get me food."
01:03:25.593,01:03:33.935,"When you come back, maybe there'll be a cave for you, maybe there won't be. Men should want women that are gonna keep the coziest, warmest caves. Men need shelter."
01:03:34.477,01:03:38.064,-I am guaranteeing shelter. -Screw Golf Guy.
01:03:38.648,01:03:43.110,I did screw Golf Guy. That's why I'm having this frigging problem.
01:03:43.194,01:03:44.195,"No, forget about him."
01:03:45.822,01:03:50.201,I will go with you to the party. I will be your other salamander.
01:03:50.576,01:03:52.620,What are you talking about? What about Suze?
01:03:53.996,01:03:56.958,She should see what it's like when her cave doesn't have any fire.
01:03:57.959,01:04:00.002,But I'm not the cavewoman. I am still the man.
01:04:01.629,01:04:02.463,Let's just go.
01:04:10.930,01:04:13.808,-You're getting married! -Hi! Hi!
01:04:15.309,01:04:18.980,"-Hey, angel, I'm so sorry I'm late. -That's okay. I don't care."
01:04:19.063,01:04:22.733,-How do I look? That's what I care about. -How do you look? You look so beautiful.
01:04:22.817,01:04:23.734,-Really? -Incredible.
01:04:23.818,01:04:27.071,"-Like slutty first Holy Communion, right? -Yes. Exactly."
01:04:27.154,01:04:31.033,"-Is that Golf Guy? -No. This is Charlie, from work."
01:04:31.117,01:04:33.995,"-Hi, Charlie from work. Nice to meet you. -Thanks for having me."
01:04:47.049,01:04:52.972,"So, as most of you know, I have, um, dated a lot of guys."
01:04:54.390,01:04:58.853,"-Hear, hear. That's my girl. -I've liked a lot of things about them."
01:04:58.936,01:05:05.026,"Like, yeah. And then I met Mike over here, and there was a lot to not like about him."
01:05:07.528,01:05:11.198,"He, um, dresses like a stepdad, as you can see."
01:05:12.533,01:05:15.536,-He listens to Creed. -Just their old stuff.
01:05:15.620,01:05:18.831,"-Non-ironically. -Okay, but they are good."
01:05:18.915,01:05:21.792,"Every single time he hears a siren, he goes, That's my ride."
01:05:21.876,01:05:24.086,"This is super fun for me, by the way."
01:05:25.963,01:05:26.797,And yet...
01:05:27.798,01:05:32.803,"Oh, man, I'm completely and totally in love with him."
01:05:34.680,01:05:42.271,"When I was little, my grandmother, she used to say: You like because, and you love despite."
01:05:43.397,01:05:48.819,"You like someone because of all of their qualities, and you love someone despite some of their qualities."
01:05:52.531,01:05:57.203,"I like you almost as much as I love you, and I can't wait to marry you."
01:06:03.834,01:06:07.046,"Okay, sorry. Get drunk so I have fun stories to tell."
01:06:11.050,01:06:11.884,Thank you.
01:06:11.968,01:06:13.052,-Okay. -All right.
01:06:13.135,01:06:18.015,"-Okay, to the last penis of my life. -That's me. That's me, yeah."
01:06:18.099,01:06:19.725,"-Oh, yeah. -One, two, three."
01:06:21.560,01:06:22.770,That's my ride.
01:06:22.853,01:06:25.439,-He does do it every time. -I know.
01:06:34.073,01:06:37.368,"-You're so good at that. -Oh, I'm just like Bruce Lee."
01:06:38.911,01:06:42.540,-I just don't even know what's going on. -Just stop thinking.
01:06:42.999,01:06:46.544,Nobody cares. Let's do it. Look at all these assholes.
01:06:53.050,01:06:58.639,"Just imagine you're paralyzed, and all of a sudden, you get feeling back into your limbs."
01:07:00.850,01:07:04.645,Now you're one of those blow-up air men outside a car dealership.
01:07:05.146,01:07:16.532,"Yeah, that's-- Don't be weird."
01:07:27.084,01:07:31.255,-What's Rick and Kirsten's and yet? -What do you mean?
01:07:32.048,01:07:36.927,"That because, love despite thing, when there are all these-- Um..."
01:07:38.721,01:07:41.057,Like all these reasons why it shouldn't work out...
01:07:42.141,01:07:44.769,but they don't care. Like Romeo and Juliet.
01:07:45.061,01:07:47.938,"Our families are mortal enemies, and yet..."
01:07:53.235,01:08:01.202,"-Rick and Kirsten don't have one. -Well, that's good, you know? We-- I mean, they can't not like anything about each other."
01:08:02.620,01:08:03.496,Not yet.
01:08:07.583,01:08:09.418,But even friendships have them.
01:08:09.502,01:08:16.884,"Like, Becca's wild, and she drinks too much, and she's never paid a bill on time, and yet I love her."
01:08:20.012,01:08:22.598,You like expensive stuff...
01:08:24.141,01:08:28.145,"and let a 23-year-old walk all over you, and yet you're tolerable."
01:08:28.229,01:08:32.566,-I do not let her walk all over me. -I'm sorry. Where are your sunglasses?
01:08:38.072,01:08:41.700,"You talk way too fast, and you are way too nice to everyone..."
01:08:45.496,01:08:50.835,-and yet... you are a terrible dancer. -That's not how it works.
01:08:55.422,01:08:56.382,I need pizza.
01:08:58.384,01:09:00.845,"So, like, we're clearing the air, you know what I mean?"
01:09:04.014,01:09:05.432,-Hi. -Hi.
01:09:05.516,01:09:07.226,"-Oh, my God. -You're drunk."
01:09:07.309,01:09:09.436,-What? Me? -Yeah.
01:09:09.937,01:09:11.647,-You. -It was an accident.
01:09:11.730,01:09:14.108,-Mm-hm -But it was also incredibly on purpose.
01:09:16.318,01:09:18.904,"-Angel. You're the love of my life, -Yeah?"
01:09:18.988,01:09:20.447,and I'm so happy for you.
01:09:21.699,01:09:24.493,"But there's no pizza on this roof, I have to go."
01:09:24.577,01:09:26.245,-Do you wanna come? -I can't.
01:09:26.328,01:09:28.038,-Sure? -I can't. But get out of here.
01:09:28.539,01:09:29.915,-Love you. -Love you.
01:09:31.792,01:09:32.668,It's time to go.
01:09:41.719,01:09:44.680,"-Where do you want these? -Oh, you can just put them on the table."
01:09:51.896,01:09:55.941,-You are gonna let the smell out. -I wish that box was my bed.
01:09:57.860,01:10:00.321,I know this is not gonna sound how I mean it to sound.
01:10:02.781,01:10:05.409,-I wanna fuck this pizza. -I get it.
01:10:06.118,01:10:08.245,You should never say that to anyone.
01:10:09.079,01:10:10.039,But I get it.
01:10:15.586,01:10:19.381,I'm sorry. Duncan's playing Third Eye Blind in there.
01:10:19.465,01:10:22.384,-What does that mean? -He's hooking up with a guy.
01:10:23.135,01:10:24.678,Duncan is gay?
01:10:25.137,01:10:25.971,What?
01:10:26.513,01:10:28.390,I'm kidding.
01:10:28.474,01:10:29.892,We cannot interrupt him.
01:10:29.975,01:10:31.810,Do you know how athletic I was?
01:10:34.396,01:10:35.272,Impressed yet?
01:10:36.815,01:10:37.900,I'm so hungry.
01:10:38.609,01:10:39.443,Too hungry.
01:10:40.444,01:10:41.570,"Oh, God. Nope."
01:10:41.654,01:10:43.364,-Do you need some help? -Yeah.
01:10:48.285,01:10:51.956,-Give me the pizza. -No. I'm gonna take it up to the top.
01:10:52.039,01:10:54.458,"Absolutely not, your hands are too small. Ah!"
01:10:54.792,01:10:56.418,-Charlie. -I'll hold it in one hand.
01:10:56.502,01:10:59.255,I'm gonna move my way up this ladder like a monkey. Stop.
01:10:59.338,01:11:01.173,Stop. I got this.
01:11:02.925,01:11:04.343,"-All right. -Oh, my God."
01:11:04.426,01:11:07.805,Stop. Keep the top up. Otherwise the cheese will slide.
01:11:10.224,01:11:14.061,-What? Just stop making me laugh. -I'm serious.
01:11:14.144,01:11:16.730,-Stop making me laugh. -I'm not trying to. I mean it.
01:11:16.814,01:11:19.692,-Okay? -It is in my possession. I got this.
01:11:23.696,01:11:25.739,"No, I'm talking to my pizza."
01:11:36.000,01:11:37.418,This is the dining room.
01:11:39.211,01:11:40.087,Careful.
01:11:44.174,01:11:47.720,"One, two, three."
01:11:50.264,01:11:51.098,Yes.
01:11:54.518,01:11:56.520,-Thank God. -That looks so good.
01:11:57.146,01:11:58.063,Just choose it.
01:12:09.116,01:12:10.159,Wow.
01:12:19.835,01:12:21.795,This is the best meal I've had...
01:12:25.132,01:12:26.592,in my entire life.
01:12:43.609,01:12:44.985,I should probably go...
01:12:45.694,01:12:46.528,home.
01:12:54.203,01:12:55.037,Slice for the road?
01:12:57.122,01:12:57.956,"Two, please."
01:12:58.874,01:13:00.501,But roll it crust-side-out.
01:13:01.668,01:13:02.503,I'm a lady.
01:13:57.683,01:13:58.517,Hey.
01:13:59.435,01:14:00.269,Hi.
01:14:03.147,01:14:06.275,"-What are you doing here? -You two, in my office, now."
01:14:13.907,01:14:14.950,this is Kirsten.
01:14:15.033,01:14:17.703,"-Kirsten's assistant, Helga. -Harper."
01:14:19.830,01:14:20.664,Hello.
01:14:23.208,01:14:28.297,"You two should get to know each other because Kirsten and I, we're getting married."
01:14:29.715,01:14:30.549,Wow.
01:14:32.468,01:14:33.302,Amazing.
01:14:35.596,01:14:42.603,"We're flying to St. John's, we're gonna elope on the beach, sunsets, all that romantic shit. We want you two to set it up."
01:14:42.978,01:14:46.231,"Us. Of course. Obviously, because who else would do it?"
01:14:46.315,01:14:48.734,"-We can do that. -Sunset, St. John's."
01:14:48.817,01:14:50.944,How come you're not writing this down like Henrietta?
01:14:51.028,01:14:52.488,-What's going on? -Oh. Um...
01:14:52.571,01:14:53.947,We can make that happen.
01:14:54.031,01:14:56.241,-When do you wanna go? -Next Saturday.
01:14:56.700,01:14:57.868,Next Saturday?
01:14:58.452,01:14:59.912,That's so soon.
01:14:59.995,01:15:03.123,"I'm gonna be gone for so long, there's gonna be little to do."
01:15:03.207,01:15:08.086,This is a good time to prep that draft on the nonagenarians you were talking about.
01:15:08.170,01:15:10.464,"Yes, please. That would be..."
01:15:13.050,01:15:16.053,"-Okay. -And, Charlie, I'm giving you a promotion."
01:15:17.387,01:15:18.222,What?
01:15:18.305,01:15:25.020,"So, when we get back, you can teach the new bastard for a few weeks, -and bring him up to your level. -Absolutely."
01:15:25.562,01:15:26.396,Okay.
01:15:32.402,01:15:34.363,Now? Are you still here?
01:15:34.446,01:15:35.280,Yeah.
01:15:40.994,01:15:42.079,"Oh, my God."
01:15:46.667,01:15:49.670,All right. We can work from the District Club today.
01:15:49.753,01:15:50.587,Sir.
01:15:55.384,01:15:58.595,"I wanna throw a big party to celebrate, um, when we're back."
01:15:58.679,01:16:00.305,Invite all the usual girls.
01:16:00.389,01:16:04.685,Maybe we should have a party before the wedding. What's on my agenda?
01:16:04.768,01:16:07.396,"You have Mary's baby shower, but I canceled that for you."
01:16:07.479,01:16:09.356,-I'll go to that now. -You will?
01:16:09.439,01:16:11.900,I'll finally have something they'll wanna talk about.
01:16:14.361,01:16:15.571,"Have a seat, Harper."
01:16:19.283,01:16:21.118,I'm gonna give you some advice.
01:16:22.703,01:16:26.331,Men don't wanna date you when you're beating them to a story.
01:16:26.748,01:16:29.585,But I have met someone who wants me to be strong.
01:16:29.668,01:16:33.005,And he likes that I'm successful. He's a goddamn unicorn.
01:16:34.798,01:16:36.508,I don't know. It feels like fate.
01:16:38.051,01:16:40.012,-I know that I've been cunty. -You haven't.
01:16:40.304,01:16:42.889,-Don't be those women that can't say cunt. -I am not.
01:16:45.726,01:16:51.106,"I know I've been cunty. It's partly because you're young and your skin bounces back, and it annoys me, but..."
01:16:51.356,01:16:53.150,it's because I want you to succeed.
01:16:55.027,01:16:56.695,What do you mean?
01:16:57.195,01:16:59.281,I see so much potential in you.
01:16:59.823,01:17:01.950,But you have to have tough skin.
01:17:02.034,01:17:08.790,"So, if I'm the most awful person when this shitstorm of an industry is hard on you, I know that you'll be prepared."
01:17:10.000,01:17:13.003,MyChef Series A is gonna be such a disaster.
01:17:13.503,01:17:16.006,We're so smart we didn't invest with them.
01:17:16.214,01:17:17.758,Don't forget to tell Kiki.
01:17:18.216,01:17:21.011,"-About MyChef? -No, dummy. About the wedding."
01:17:21.219,01:17:23.430,And the date. Six weeks before hers.
01:17:23.513,01:17:24.473,Is she invited?
01:17:25.140,01:17:28.477,Send her a big bouquet of daisies. She hates daisies.
01:17:28.560,01:17:30.103,"With a note that says, Ha, ha."
01:17:30.979,01:17:35.942,"I'm gonna beat you to the altar. But tonight, we're gonna knock boots like we did on that Swiss gondola."
01:17:36.026,01:17:37.444,"-And, obviously, -Um, what?"
01:17:37.527,01:17:40.489,tell Kirsten I have a meeting or something tonight.
01:17:43.283,01:17:49.039,"Well... I just thought, uh-- I thought you were gonna marry Kirsten."
01:17:49.289,01:17:56.171,"Yeah, I am. Which reminds me. This week, go to a ring spot and get a ring so big, you can see that shit from space."
01:17:58.548,01:17:59.800,Food here sucks.
01:18:03.804,01:18:05.305,"Charlie, you did it."
01:18:06.223,01:18:07.641,"What? Well, I didn't."
01:18:08.016,01:18:09.643,I did it. We both did it.
01:18:09.893,01:18:11.436,What are we talking about?
01:18:12.896,01:18:17.442,"I know this started out selfishly for us, but we made two people fall in love."
01:18:17.526,01:18:20.028,We made two miserable people happy.
01:18:20.654,01:18:23.532,"I thought best-case, they'd date for a month."
01:18:23.740,01:18:27.703,But they actually really like each other. We changed their lives.
01:18:28.954,01:18:32.666,I'm proud of us. I think we did something really good.
01:18:34.501,01:18:35.335,"Me, too."
01:18:36.253,01:18:38.755,"So, I was looking at the, uh, Caneel Bay Resort."
01:18:39.131,01:18:41.341,"They have a, uh, slot next Saturday."
01:18:50.308,01:18:52.686,Will you come help me pick out the ring?
01:18:52.894,01:18:55.772,"Absolutely not. I gotta go to the office, drop off these things."
01:18:56.231,01:18:58.650,Please? You're better at this than me.
01:18:58.734,01:19:01.862,I need female expertise. You know what Kirsten likes.
01:19:01.945,01:19:04.781,You're beautiful. You're charming. You are witty.
01:19:07.200,01:19:12.122,"Yes! Great. If you're going back to the office, can you grab Rick's personal Amex on my desk?"
01:19:21.757,01:19:24.634,"Oh, no, no. Of course I want them."
01:19:25.427,01:19:28.638,I don't wanna show them to a bunch of Japanese bankers.
01:19:36.772,01:19:39.733,"Okay. Tonight, you need to wear that red dress."
01:19:40.734,01:19:43.111,Because you look so hot in that dress.
01:19:43.195,01:19:44.780,I can't concentrate.
01:19:50.243,01:19:52.829,We're not married anymore. You can't tell me what to wear.
01:19:52.913,01:19:54.956,Can we try that thing we did on our honeymoon?
01:20:03.381,01:20:05.550,"-Hi. -Oh, is this the lucky lady?"
01:20:06.134,01:20:08.553,How do you think Kirsten feels about blood diamonds?
01:20:08.637,01:20:09.679,Uh...
01:20:10.388,01:20:13.308,Here. It was so weird when I got the card.
01:20:14.351,01:20:16.561,I heard Rick flirting with somebody on the phone.
01:20:17.270,01:20:20.857,I think Kirsten's in a meeting. What do you think that was?
01:20:21.274,01:20:27.906,"I-- What I think it probably was, he likes to leave like a super-sexy little voicemail for her to listen to."
01:20:28.323,01:20:29.449,And hear later.
01:20:29.699,01:20:30.826,-I... -Yes.
01:20:30.909,01:20:33.578,think Kirsten likes topaz. Do you think she likes topaz?
01:20:33.662,01:20:35.789,Sure. Do you think Kiki likes topaz?
01:20:35.872,01:20:38.250,She didn't mention it when she and Rick were having phone sex.
01:20:41.211,01:20:44.089,-You tricked me. That was entrapment. -You just admitted it.
01:20:44.422,01:20:47.926,-You lied to me. You knew. -It's one time. It was a mistake.
01:20:48.009,01:20:53.849,-Doesn't mean anything. -After everything we did-- He's confused. He just needed to get it out of his system before the wedding.
01:20:55.350,01:20:57.769,"The wedding? They can't still get married, Charlie."
01:20:58.019,01:21:01.565,"Oh, this is for a wedding. I actually have a great selection."
01:21:01.648,01:21:03.024,We need one minute. Thank you.
01:21:03.108,01:21:07.070,"Harper, we can keep this from her. We control their phones, e-mails."
01:21:07.445,01:21:09.698,We're the men behind the curtain. She doesn't have to know.
01:21:13.118,01:21:14.995,You wanna help Rick cheat on Kirsten?
01:21:15.662,01:21:18.498,We have faked their entire relationship.
01:21:18.790,01:21:23.169,"Now one thing goes wrong, it's a crime to suddenly work behind the scenes?"
01:21:25.255,01:21:26.089,No.
01:21:28.216,01:21:29.467,It was never okay.
01:21:31.094,01:21:40.812,But now you're willing... to ruin somebody's life just so you can keep dating some boring girl and work longer hours in a job that does not matter.
01:21:41.021,01:21:43.023,Whose life am I ruining? Theirs?
01:21:43.106,01:21:46.109,"-They had no lives. We gave them lives. -Oh, my God."
01:21:51.448,01:21:55.410,"Rick is-- He's a selfish, superficial asshole, but he can't help it."
01:21:55.952,01:21:59.956,"You could be a good person, but you wanna be an asshole."
01:22:00.081,01:22:06.796,You're so obsessed with getting promoted and becoming Rick. You're choosing to be a piece of shit.
01:22:06.880,01:22:08.882,Stop pretending this is some moral dilemma.
01:22:08.965,01:22:11.676,You are afraid not to be an assistant anymore.
01:22:11.968,01:22:13.261,That's ridiculous.
01:22:13.345,01:22:15.597,Have you written anything with all this free time?
01:22:15.847,01:22:18.934,Anything? You finish one article or you just keep planning to?
01:22:19.601,01:22:24.522,"I think you'd rather run around, getting coffee than sit down, write something and find out you suck."
01:22:32.948,01:22:34.157,I'm telling Kirsten.
01:22:37.661,01:22:38.620,The whole truth.
01:22:41.623,01:22:42.457,All of it.
01:22:46.002,01:22:46.836,Harper.
01:22:51.299,01:22:57.055,"No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. That was the-- You're not under arrest. Put your hands down."
01:22:57.138,01:23:00.350,We need to get the ring off. This happens all the time.
01:23:00.433,01:23:07.524,"Not the part where you two collaborate to, like, trick your bosses into dating and then it blows-- I wasn't listening."
01:23:26.209,01:23:27.210,Hey.
01:23:28.878,01:23:30.797,"Uh, I'm sorry to just show up."
01:23:30.880,01:23:33.883,"-You forgot this. -Thanks. Honestly, you saved me."
01:23:33.967,01:23:39.806,"If I have to hear another woman talk about how much her nipples changed since giving birth, I'll kill myself."
01:23:39.889,01:23:41.307,"I swear to God, Harper."
01:23:41.391,01:23:44.686,"I walked in here with a fiancé, and suddenly, I'm a member of a club."
01:23:44.769,01:23:46.438,They wanna talk about having kids.
01:23:46.521,01:23:50.442,"-First, I have to be a stepmother. -I don't think you should be a stepmother."
01:23:50.525,01:23:53.528,I don't think you should marry Rick because you don't actually like him.
01:23:54.446,01:23:57.157,"-Of course I do. I love him. -No, you don't."
01:23:59.617,01:24:02.162,"This whole thing, your whole relationship, it's not real."
01:24:02.537,01:24:03.830,What are you talking about?
01:24:04.539,01:24:07.667,"-Rick's assistant and I set you up. -No, you didn't."
01:24:08.960,01:24:15.008,"We shut down the elevator so you'd meet. The Yankees game, I got you on the Kiss Cam. And when you guys broke up..."
01:24:15.925,01:24:17.343,we told him what to say.
01:24:18.678,01:24:22.307,"Nantucket, the flowers, that was us. We made you think you liked each other."
01:24:22.390,01:24:25.810,"You don't know this guy. You don't like him. What you feel for him, it's not real."
01:24:27.353,01:24:29.147,You have no idea what is real.
01:24:29.230,01:24:31.733,You think you understand the intimacy of a relationship?
01:24:31.816,01:24:33.902,You're 25. I don't care how it started.
01:24:33.985,01:24:35.945,-He doesn't see you. He-- -Stop...
01:24:37.655,01:24:38.490,talking.
01:24:42.285,01:24:43.203,You're fired.
01:24:44.287,01:24:45.121,What?
01:24:46.623,01:24:47.457,Get out.
01:24:55.340,01:24:56.257,Tickets booked?
01:24:56.716,01:24:58.551,Uh... Yeah. Yes.
01:24:59.219,01:25:00.178,They are.
01:25:00.512,01:25:01.554,For the wedding.
01:25:02.055,01:25:02.931,Cool.
01:25:12.732,01:25:14.526,-but hear me out. -Who is this?
01:25:15.693,01:25:16.528,Harper?
01:25:16.611,01:25:19.155,I'm covering Kirsten's desk. Can I help you?
01:25:23.701,01:25:24.536,No.
01:25:25.662,01:25:26.496,Thank you.
01:25:47.851,01:25:49.227,Coming to drinks later?
01:25:57.235,01:25:59.112,We thought the market cap was overvalued.
01:25:59.195,01:26:01.865,"We looked at college towns, and surprisingly..."
01:26:03.366,01:26:05.743,You gotta be better.
01:26:10.039,01:26:11.749,This is not working.
01:26:23.344,01:26:32.562,"Mom, it turns out touring wedding venues is so much more fun than touring colleges, because of all the free food and booze out-- Oh, I gotta call you back."
01:26:32.812,01:26:34.147,"Oh, my God."
01:26:34.230,01:26:38.735,"It is like a tornado hit a Chinese-- Hey, are you okay?"
01:26:38.818,01:26:41.446,Why are you not at work? Harper.
01:26:43.114,01:26:44.741,Because I got fired.
01:26:46.075,01:26:46.910,Really?
01:26:47.911,01:26:49.495,That's amazing.
01:26:49.579,01:26:51.122,Congratulations.
01:26:51.581,01:26:52.415,Right?
01:26:54.834,01:26:55.710,Are you okay?
01:26:58.213,01:26:59.839,I spent so much time there.
01:27:00.215,01:27:02.300,And I never wrote a single article.
01:27:03.551,01:27:05.220,Now Kirsten hates me.
01:27:05.720,01:27:08.306,And she'll never help me.
01:27:10.016,01:27:15.897,"I'm bad at this. I've been trying to write the same article for months, Becca."
01:27:16.105,01:27:18.233,And it's so bad I can't finish it.
01:27:26.658,01:27:27.492,Ow!
01:27:27.575,01:27:29.577,Of course your first draft is gonna be bad.
01:27:29.661,01:27:32.247,"It's gonna be terrible. Then you know what you do, Harper?"
01:27:32.330,01:27:34.415,You go back and you make it better.
01:27:34.499,01:27:37.919,But you can't make it better until you actually do it.
01:27:38.002,01:27:43.633,You're not a bad writer yet. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and just write something bad.
01:27:43.967,01:27:47.804,"Yes, Kirsten was mean. But you learned so much from her."
01:27:47.887,01:27:50.139,You just never had the time to use it.
01:27:50.890,01:27:53.935,"And now, bud, you got the time."
01:27:54.018,01:27:57.230,"So, get off your bony little ass and just do it!"
01:27:57.313,01:27:58.815,-Okay. -Okay.
01:27:59.649,01:28:00.733,I'm gonna write...
01:28:01.651,01:28:04.487,the shittiest article ever written.
01:28:04.570,01:28:06.864,Yes. It's gonna suck ass. I can't wait to read it.
01:28:06.948,01:28:09.242,Okay. I got this.
01:28:09.325,01:28:11.327,Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay.
01:28:12.287,01:28:14.622,Are you cleaning this up? Are we gonna hire someone?
01:28:18.835,01:28:22.338,I am not leaving this chair until I write an entire article.
01:28:23.256,01:28:27.427,-Great. That's great news for me. -Can I get some free chips and water?
01:28:33.016,01:28:36.561,This is where Kim threw Kanye's half-birthday party.
01:28:37.103,01:28:38.438,Our best table.
01:28:45.278,01:28:46.696,This is exciting.
01:28:55.371,01:28:56.414,Mm.
01:28:58.041,01:28:58.875,"Oh, my God."
01:29:00.043,01:29:03.129,This is the best meal I've ever had.
01:29:10.762,01:29:14.474,The best meal I ever had was a $5 pizza thrown up a fire escape.
01:29:16.476,01:29:17.310,What?
01:29:21.606,01:29:22.565,This sucks.
01:29:23.775,01:29:25.151,This whole place sucks.
01:29:26.402,01:29:28.946,It smells weird. It's far too quiet.
01:29:29.447,01:29:32.492,And this steak is delicious. It is not worth $70.
01:29:32.950,01:29:36.371,"And you and I, we never talk about anything."
01:29:40.374,01:29:43.544,I don't want to wanna be an asshole.
01:29:44.504,01:29:46.047,You sound insane.
01:29:47.256,01:29:48.466,Just eat your steak.
01:29:53.262,01:29:56.516,"If my 15-year-old self would see me now, he would punch me in the dick."
01:29:58.935,01:30:00.770,"I don't wanna do this anymore, Suze."
01:30:01.562,01:30:03.022,But you're my backup.
01:30:04.524,01:30:05.483,Mm.
01:30:09.946,01:30:10.780,You know what?
01:30:11.739,01:30:14.075,"Order whatever you want, on me."
01:30:17.161,01:30:20.039,What am I doing? You're not my girlfriend anymore. Give me that.
01:30:20.123,01:30:21.332,I'm not Rockefeller.
01:30:33.344,01:30:35.346,Harper. You were right.
01:30:35.805,01:30:38.474,We can't let them do this. I'm going to JFK.
01:30:38.724,01:30:40.143,Meet me at the terminal.
01:30:40.977,01:30:42.145,It's the cheap one.
01:30:43.396,01:30:45.439,Don't have time. Leaving the coat.
01:30:45.982,01:30:48.985,I need a taxi. I gotta get to the airport right now.
01:30:49.068,01:30:52.655,I gotta stop someone from getting married. Flight leaves in-- Oh.
01:30:53.197,01:30:54.615,"I got, like, four hours."
01:30:55.324,01:30:58.911,And we've been to Times Square. What about museums? Should we go to the Met?
01:30:58.995,01:31:02.748,Do you like beautiful art that makes you re-examine what it means to be human?
01:31:03.040,01:31:05.126,"-Yeah. -Then, yeah. The Met's worth it."
01:31:05.209,01:31:08.713,"In fact, it may still be open if you go right-- Oh, my God."
01:31:08.796,01:31:10.756,I did the over-dick-around thing.
01:31:16.012,01:31:16.846,Sorry.
01:31:20.975,01:31:21.809,Rick?
01:31:25.938,01:31:28.065,Hey. Did I forget something?
01:31:28.691,01:31:30.818,Yeah. That you're a bastard.
01:31:33.237,01:31:35.781,I don't wanna be like you. I'm not gonna be.
01:31:36.949,01:31:39.035,I don't want the promotion. I quit.
01:31:41.078,01:31:41.954,Okay.
01:31:42.538,01:31:44.582,Kirsten? Don't marry him.
01:31:46.292,01:31:49.670,"Do it, honey. Go with the young guy."
01:31:52.215,01:31:53.299,"Oh, no. No, no."
01:31:53.382,01:31:59.388,"I mean, she's a very handsome woman. Just-- -Not what's going on here. -Charlie. You're fired as fuck."
01:31:59.472,01:32:01.349,I literally just quit.
01:32:01.974,01:32:06.479,"Kirsten, I know you don't know me, but I know you, because all Harper does is talk about you."
01:32:07.146,01:32:10.524,"And even when she's complaining about you, she's really complimenting you."
01:32:10.858,01:32:17.657,"I know how hard you work and what a badass you are, and I know you don't put up with any shit. So, don't put up with his."
01:32:18.991,01:32:22.620,"I don't know what you think you're getting out of this, but you deserve better."
01:32:23.246,01:32:24.163,You are better.
01:32:26.457,01:32:29.460,"Oh, my God. Gave myself goose bumps."
01:32:29.710,01:32:31.420,He's crazy. You realize that?
01:32:32.296,01:32:33.130,Hmm?
01:32:36.634,01:32:37.843,What's my favorite food?
01:32:39.971,01:32:42.348,Your favorite-- It's steak tartare.
01:32:43.099,01:32:45.351,"It's green curry, you douche-tard."
01:32:45.434,01:32:48.771,She likes it medium-spicy from Thai Leaf on Broadway.
01:32:49.897,01:32:51.399,What's my favorite place?
01:32:54.485,01:32:55.653,This is ridiculous.
01:32:56.112,01:32:56.946,Why are we--?
01:32:57.989,01:32:58.823,Kirsten.
01:33:00.241,01:33:01.492,Your name is Kirsten.
01:33:02.410,01:33:04.912,"Squam Lake, New Hampshire, you douche-tard."
01:33:06.080,01:33:10.960,"Charlie, I know you're no longer his assistant, but could you please strike wedding from his calendar?"
01:33:11.335,01:33:12.670,Absolutely.
01:33:13.713,01:33:15.047,Are you being serious?
01:33:16.340,01:33:18.175,No. Kiki's short for Kirsten.
01:33:38.779,01:33:39.697,I finished.
01:33:41.574,01:33:42.658,I finished.
01:33:43.701,01:33:44.785,The whole article.
01:33:45.828,01:33:47.413,I finished it.
01:33:47.496,01:33:49.332,From beginning to end.
01:33:50.583,01:33:53.085,I finished it. I finished the whole thing.
01:33:53.169,01:33:58.883,"You, sir, are a hero and scholar, and are about to receive the greatest tip in the history of the service industry."
01:34:02.178,01:34:07.350,"Technically, I don't have my wallet on me. Tomorrow-- Leave this place and never return."
01:34:19.320,01:34:20.237,Hey.
01:34:20.696,01:34:22.907,-What do you want? -You live here?
01:34:24.867,01:34:25.993,It's disgusting.
01:34:26.702,01:34:28.245,"Hold up. Hold up, hold up."
01:34:28.621,01:34:30.831,"I'm sorry. I just-- I, uh..."
01:34:31.624,01:34:34.960,"I need some information on, uh, my wife. My ex-wife."
01:34:35.294,01:34:36.253,Like what?
01:34:37.213,01:34:38.297,Uh...
01:34:38.589,01:34:47.014,"I got some written down here. Uh, assorted favorites, as in, uh, favorite foods, -flowers, clothing-- -Are you serious?"
01:34:47.723,01:34:51.477,"Look, I realize I should know this. But you used to do all this stuff for me."
01:34:56.190,01:34:57.316,I want her back.
01:35:00.611,01:35:02.029,I have an old Kiki file.
01:35:05.741,01:35:06.992,Thank you. Thank you.
01:35:07.493,01:35:08.536,-Yeah. -Thank you.
01:35:09.245,01:35:11.372,-I really appreciate this. -Rick.
01:35:11.831,01:35:13.999,-You still work for this guy? -Nope.
01:35:16.961,01:35:19.088,"It's soy. Nice seeing you, Rick."
01:35:39.024,01:35:40.151,-Hi. -Oh.
01:35:40.860,01:35:42.194,Thank God you're here.
01:35:42.278,01:35:45.823,I can't find that piece on lesbian soccer players in Nigeria.
01:35:46.407,01:35:48.492,Probably in your deleted folder.
01:35:48.576,01:35:53.414,-I can't find Julie's number. -You made me change it -to Satan in your contacts. -Come back to work.
01:35:54.081,01:35:54.915,What?
01:35:54.999,01:36:01.714,You crossed every line ever. I genuinely considered setting you up for white-collar crime and just letting you rot in jail.
01:36:04.008,01:36:06.635,But I understand in some ways what you were trying to do.
01:36:06.719,01:36:08.846,You're not an unintelligent person.
01:36:09.054,01:36:12.266,I don't know how you did all this. This place is falling apart without you.
01:36:16.145,01:36:17.897,Come back and do it with me.
01:36:19.148,01:36:20.858,I learned so much from you.
01:36:23.277,01:36:24.236,You're my hero.
01:36:28.699,01:36:33.412,"But if I wanna actually be a writer, I have to stop making excuses not to write."
01:36:35.664,01:36:37.458,"So, I can't be your assistant."
01:36:38.834,01:36:40.377,But I'd love to help you find a new one.
01:36:42.671,01:36:43.797,You're fired again.
01:36:44.215,01:36:47.843,-I have to get my stuff. This is awkward. -Have you written anything?
01:36:48.385,01:36:50.888,Have I written anything? Yes. I have written something.
01:36:50.971,01:36:53.265,It's just-- It's right here.
01:36:54.225,01:36:55.434,Let's go over it.
01:36:56.101,01:36:59.438,-Tell me something I don't know. -Okay.
01:37:02.483,01:37:09.323,"-Twilight Champions. -Yeah, but that title is-- -No, I like it. I love the title. -I like it, too. I could like it."
01:37:09.406,01:37:11.742,This is about the geriatric Olympiads?
01:37:12.493,01:37:18.582,"If I spend too much time on Gilda in the beginning, people will know that she's gonna die. Let her death be a twist."
01:37:19.166,01:37:49.947,Hold off until after Harry wins his first med-- Hi.
01:37:50.906,01:37:51.740,Hi.
01:37:54.326,01:37:56.036,"So, what are you doing here?"
01:37:56.120,01:37:59.540,"Oh, Kirsten told me to meet her. What are you doing here?"
01:38:02.001,01:38:03.877,"Oh, my God."
01:38:05.838,01:38:10.718,"-She Cyrano'd us. -Yes, she-- I Googled it. So, I know what it means now."
01:38:13.971,01:38:15.264,Why are you dressed like that?
01:38:16.307,01:38:19.268,I don't work here anymore. I quit working for Rick.
01:38:21.186,01:38:23.355,Starting over. At 28.
01:38:24.481,01:38:31.989,"Actually, I'm a temp, which is technically lower on the totem pole than an assistant, which is kind of a kick in the nuts."
01:38:33.490,01:38:38.245,"But it's, um, kind of cool. I get to see a bunch of different jobs."
01:38:39.455,01:38:41.248,Find out what I actually like.
01:38:43.000,01:38:43.834,I like you.
01:38:45.961,01:38:47.046,"So, so much."
01:38:49.590,01:38:51.383,You're not hard to get at all.
01:38:52.551,01:38:53.761,You're hard to earn.
01:38:54.887,01:38:56.639,It's so much better.
01:38:58.474,01:39:01.810,You displayed a total lack of character when it mattered.
01:39:04.855,01:39:05.689,I know.
01:39:08.275,01:39:13.030,"Charlie, you have the romantic and sexual personality of a seventh-grader."
01:39:14.990,01:39:17.534,Seventh? I feel like it'd be at least high school.
01:39:17.826,01:39:19.703,You wear suits to sports games.
01:39:21.205,01:39:22.039,What?
01:39:27.920,01:39:29.171,You're a know-it-all.
01:39:30.381,01:39:34.176,You are unbelievably bad at beer pong.
01:39:34.843,01:39:38.555,You're a sore winner. And you use too many exclamation points.
01:39:42.393,01:39:43.394,And yet...
01:40:37.865,01:40:38.991,I feel joy.
01:40:41.744,01:40:44.580,"Maybe I love love in open spaces, too."
01:41:48.435,01:41:49.311,Yeah!
