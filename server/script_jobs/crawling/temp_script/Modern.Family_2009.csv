00:00:15.599,00:00:17.892,Kids? Get down here!
00:00:17.976,00:00:21.104,Why are you guys yelling at us when we’re way upstairs?
00:00:21.188,00:00:23.523,Just text me.
00:00:23.607,00:00:25.608,"And, wow! You’re not wearing that outfit."
00:00:25.692,00:00:28.194,What’s wrong with it?
00:00:28.278,00:00:30.822,about her skirt?
00:00:30.906,00:00:33.700,"- Oh, yeah. That looks really cute, sweetheart. - Thanks."
00:00:33.784,00:00:37.412,No. It’s way too short. People know you’re a girl. You don’t need to prove it to them.
00:00:37.496,00:00:39.873,Luke got his head stuck in the banister again.
00:00:39.957,00:00:42.041,I got it. Where’s the baby oil?
00:00:42.125,00:00:45.712,It’s on our bedside tab– I don’t know. Find it.
00:00:47.214,00:00:48.715,Come on!
00:00:48.799,00:00:51.885,Phil &amp; Claire Married 16 years I was out of control growing up.
00:00:51.969,00:00:53.803,"There, you know? I said it."
00:00:53.887,00:00:56.556,I-I just don’t want my kids...
00:00:56.640,00:00:58.391,to make the same bad mistakes I made.
00:00:58.475,00:01:04.564,"I-If Haley never wakes up on a beach in Florida, half-naked, I’ve done my job."
00:01:04.648,00:01:07.317,Our job.
00:01:07.401,00:01:09.319,I’ve done our job.
00:01:09.403,00:01:11.863,"¡Vamos, Manny! Kick it! Kick it!"
00:01:11.947,00:01:13.615,Don’t let him– Kick it!
00:01:13.699,00:01:16.534,"Manny, go! ¡A la derecha! ¡A la derecha!"
00:01:16.618,00:01:19.037,"No! No, no."
00:01:21.498,00:01:24.083,"Gloria, they’re O and 6. Let’s take it down a notch."
00:01:24.167,00:01:28.880,Jay &amp; Gloria Married 6 months Jay’s from the city.
00:01:28.964,00:01:31.466,He has a big business.
00:01:31.550,00:01:33.760,I come from a small village.
00:01:33.844,00:01:36.262,"Very poor but very, very beautiful."
00:01:36.346,00:01:41.017,It’s the number one village in all Colombia for all the– What’s the word?
00:01:41.101,00:01:44.604,Murders.
00:01:44.688,00:01:46.439,"Manny, stop him!"
00:01:46.523,00:01:49.359,Stop him! You can do it!
00:01:54.865,00:01:57.408,"Come on, Coach. You gotta take that kid out."
00:01:57.492,00:02:00.203,You wanna take him out? How about I take you out?
00:02:00.287,00:02:03.539,"- Honey, honey. - Why don’t you worry about your son?"
00:02:03.623,00:02:06.542,He spent the first half with his hand in his pants!
00:02:09.254,00:02:12.049,I’ve wanted to tell her off for the last six weeks.
00:02:13.300,00:02:15.218,I’m Josh. Ryan’s dad.
00:02:15.302,00:02:17.887,"Hi, I’m Gloria Pritchett. Manny’s mother."
00:02:17.971,00:02:20.223,"- Oh, and this must be your dad. - Her dad?"
00:02:20.307,00:02:21.557,Yeah.
00:02:21.641,00:02:23.184,"Actually, no, I’m her husband."
00:02:23.268,00:02:27.397,"Don’t be fooled by the, uh– Give me a second here."
00:02:29.232,00:02:32.151,Who is a good girl? Who’s that?
00:02:32.235,00:02:33.861,Who’s that?
00:02:33.945,00:02:36.990,"- Oh, she’s adorable. - Oh, thank you."
00:02:37.074,00:02:39.367,"Hi, precious. Hello."
00:02:39.451,00:02:41.035,Hi. Hi.
00:02:41.119,00:02:43.955,"Uh, we just, uh– We just adopted her from Vietnam."
00:02:44.039,00:02:46.332,"And we’re bringing her home for the first time, huh?"
00:02:46.416,00:02:49.210,She’s an angel. You and your wife must be thrilled.
00:02:49.294,00:02:52.046,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. Daddy needed snacks."
00:02:52.130,00:02:54.340,Hi.
00:02:59.679,00:03:04.100,"Uh, we have been together for– guh, five– five years now?"
00:03:04.184,00:03:06.894,"And, uh, we just– we decided we really wanted to have a baby."
00:03:06.978,00:03:13.234,"Mitchell &amp; Cameron So, we had initially asked one of our lesbian friends to be a surrogate, but– Then we figured, they’re already mean enough."
00:03:13.318,00:03:15.111,Can you imagine one of ’em pregnant?
00:03:15.195,00:03:16.863,"No, thank you. Ick."
00:03:16.947,00:03:23.369,"You saw that, right? Everybody fawning over Lily, and then you walk on and suddenly it’s all, Ooh, SkyMall."
00:03:23.453,00:03:25.371,I gotta buy a motorized tie rack.
00:03:25.455,00:03:28.416,"All right, you know, I’m gonna give the speech."
00:03:28.500,00:03:30.877,You’re gonna be stuck with these people for the next five hours.
00:03:30.961,00:03:32.712,"You’re right, you’re right. Okay. I’m sorry."
00:03:32.796,00:03:35.631,- Look at that baby with those cream puffs. - Okay. Excuse me.
00:03:35.715,00:03:37.508,Excuse me.
00:03:37.592,00:03:40.636,This baby would have grown up in a crowded orphanage if it wasn’t for us cream puffs.
00:03:40.720,00:03:42.847,And you know what? Note to all of you who judge– Mitchell!
00:03:42.931,00:03:45.767,"- Hear this. Love knows no race, creed– - Mitchell."
00:03:45.851,00:03:47.226,or gender.
00:03:47.310,00:03:49.562,"And shame on you, you small-minded, ignorant few– Mitchell."
00:03:49.646,00:03:51.939,Mitchell!
00:03:54.818,00:03:56.778,Oh.
00:04:00.532,00:04:03.118,We would like to pay for everyone’s headsets.
00:04:15.755,00:04:18.883,Buddy. Why do you keep getting stuck like this?
00:04:18.967,00:04:20.593,I thought I could get out this time.
00:04:20.677,00:04:25.139,I’m just gonna say it. He needs to be checked by a specialist.
00:04:25.223,00:04:27.600,Ow!
00:04:29.769,00:04:31.687,I’m having a friend over today. Who?
00:04:31.771,00:04:35.358,"Uh, you don’t know him."
00:04:35.442,00:04:37.860,"Ooh, a boy. You gonna kiss him?"
00:04:40.322,00:04:42.323,"Yeah, shut up!"
00:04:42.407,00:04:44.617,"- Luke, Alex, why don’t you take it outside, okay? - And do what?"
00:04:44.701,00:04:47.412,Fight in the sun. It’ll be a nice change.
00:04:49.372,00:04:50.998,His name is Dylan.
00:04:51.082,00:04:52.750,I might as well tell him not to come...
00:04:52.834,00:04:54.669,because you guys are just going to embarrass me again.
00:04:54.753,00:04:57.547,"Sweetie, hang on a second."
00:04:57.631,00:04:59.966,"You’re 15, and it’s the first time you’ve had a boy over."
00:05:00.050,00:05:03.428,"I’m bound to be a little surprised, but I’m not gonna embarrass you."
00:05:05.764,00:05:09.225,I’m kidding. Come on. Who are you talking to?
00:05:09.309,00:05:12.687,I’m the cool dad. That’s– That’s my thing.
00:05:12.771,00:05:14.522,I’m hip. I– I surf the Web.
00:05:14.606,00:05:18.484,"I text. LOL– Laugh out loud. OMG– Oh, my God."
00:05:18.568,00:05:20.653,WTF– Why the face?
00:05:20.737,00:05:39.005,"Um, you know, I know all the dances to High School Musical, so– Luke just shot me!"
00:05:39.089,00:05:41.048,Are you okay?
00:05:43.426,00:05:47.263,- Language! - They’re only plastic BBs. It was an accident.
00:05:47.347,00:05:49.932,What did I tell you would happen if you got him a gun?
00:05:50.016,00:05:53.019,Deal with this.
00:05:55.105,00:05:57.565,"That’s it? That’s– No, no, no, no."
00:05:57.649,00:06:00.818,"The agreement was that if he shoots someone, you shoot him."
00:06:00.902,00:06:03.613,We were serious about that?
00:06:03.697,00:06:05.907,And now you have to follow through.
00:06:09.953,00:06:11.954,Go.
00:06:12.038,00:06:14.290,"- What’s more important here, Dad? - You can shoot him afterwards."
00:06:14.374,00:06:17.418,He’ll be home at 2:00. I can’t shoot him at 2:00. I’m showing a house at 2:00.
00:06:17.502,00:06:20.421,"- What about 3:00? - No, he’s got a soccer game at 3:00."
00:06:20.505,00:06:23.883,"And then– Oh, we gotta leave for that dinner thing at 5:00."
00:06:23.967,00:06:25.718,4:15. You could shoot him at 4:15.
00:06:25.802,00:06:28.012,"Yeah, I guess that works for me."
00:06:28.096,00:06:31.098,Shoot Luke.
00:06:31.182,00:06:33.643,"Oh, come on!"
00:06:34.811,00:06:37.355,I’m quitting soccer. It is a game for children.
00:06:37.439,00:06:39.065,"No, you’re not quitting."
00:06:39.149,00:06:41.943,You would have stopped that goal if you weren’t staring at that little girl.
00:06:42.027,00:06:45.572,She is not a girl. She’s a woman.
00:06:47.824,00:06:51.619,"You know, Gloria, that little blowup with that other mom– Why do you have to do things like that?"
00:06:51.703,00:06:54.497,"If somebody says something about my family, I’m going to– I’m just saying."
00:06:54.581,00:06:56.499,You could take it down here a little bit. That’s all.
00:06:56.583,00:06:58.376,"Oh, yeah. ’Cause that’s where you live, down here."
00:06:58.460,00:07:01.462,"But I live up here! Yeah, but you don’t have to be so emotional all the time."
00:07:01.546,00:07:04.257,"That’s all I’m saying. Manny, you’re with me on this, right?"
00:07:04.341,00:07:06.926,I wanna tell Brenda Feldman I love her.
00:07:07.010,00:07:10.429,"Manny, she’s 16."
00:07:10.513,00:07:13.808,"Hey, watch it."
00:07:13.892,00:07:17.103,"But first I need to get my white shirt, the silk one."
00:07:17.187,00:07:19.605,Okay. If that’s what you really want to do.
00:07:19.689,00:07:22.775,"Not to be the evil stepdad, but if you put on a puffy white shirt..."
00:07:22.859,00:07:28.197,"and declare your love for a 16-year-old, you’re gonna be swinging from the flagpole in your puffy white underpants."
00:07:28.281,00:07:31.409,Stop the car.
00:07:35.038,00:07:42.003,"See? You hurt his feelings. Ah– Well, if it toughens him up a little bit then– Oh, geez. He’s picking flowers."
00:07:42.087,00:07:45.131,"Manny’s very passionate, just like his father."
00:07:45.215,00:07:49.260,"My first husband– he’s very handsome, but too crazy."
00:07:49.344,00:07:54.682,"It seemed like all we did was fight and make love, fight and make love, fight and make love."
00:07:54.766,00:07:58.477,"One time, I’m not kidding you, we fell out the window together."
00:07:58.561,00:08:00.396,Which– Which one were you doing?
00:08:02.232,00:08:04.900,I’m hearing this for the first time.
00:08:04.984,00:08:07.361,This doesn’t worry you?
00:08:07.445,00:08:09.655,She barely slept on the plane and she’s still wide awake.
00:08:09.739,00:08:12.700,"- Oh, stop worrying. - I can’t."
00:08:12.784,00:08:14.660,That– That orphanage was all women.
00:08:14.744,00:08:17.538,Maybe she just– she can’t fall asleep unless she feels a woman’s shape.
00:08:17.622,00:08:21.083,I guess that’s possible.
00:08:21.167,00:08:23.336,What the hell is that supposed to mean?
00:08:23.420,00:08:29.091,"Yes, I’ve gained a few extra pounds while we were expecting the baby, which has been very difficult."
00:08:29.175,00:08:33.346,"But apparently your body does a nesting, very maternal, primal thing..."
00:08:33.430,00:08:37.808,where it retains nutrients– some sort of molecular physiology thing.
00:08:37.892,00:08:39.769,But that’s science.
00:08:39.853,00:08:49.362,"You can’t– You can’t fight it, so– - I’m not saying anything. - You’re saying everything."
00:08:50.613,00:08:52.198,Count to three.
00:08:50.613,00:08:54.617,"One, two– Three."
00:08:54.701,00:08:57.078,"Oh, Cam. This is beautiful."
00:08:57.162,00:09:00.665,"Yes, I– What the hell is that?"
00:09:00.749,00:09:05.169,I had Andre do it while we were gone.
00:09:05.253,00:09:07.630,"We’re floating above her, always there to protect her."
00:09:07.714,00:09:10.257,"Okay. Well, that’s reassuring, right, Lily?"
00:09:10.341,00:09:13.511,"Yes, we tore you away from everything you know, but don’t worry, things are normal here."
00:09:13.595,00:09:18.057,"Your fathers are floating fairies. No, can you call Andre, have him paint something a little less gay?"
00:09:18.141,00:09:21.852,"By the way, we need to stop having friends with names like Andre."
00:09:21.936,00:09:23.938,Redheaded dad is angry daddy.
00:09:24.022,00:09:26.982,"Yes, you are. Even Pepper pointed it out on the way home from the airport."
00:09:27.066,00:09:29.068,"Okay, that’s another one– Pepper."
00:09:29.152,00:09:31.070,"Okay, what’s up?"
00:09:31.154,00:09:38.244,"All right, look. I– I– I never told my family we were adopting a baby."
00:09:38.328,00:09:40.621,And– I know.
00:09:40.705,00:09:44.291,You do?
00:09:44.375,00:09:46.585,You’d tell ’em. They’d say something judgmental.
00:09:46.669,00:09:48.337,Exactly.
00:09:48.421,00:09:50.840,I know. And then something that’s supposed to be nothing but joyful...
00:09:50.924,00:09:52.591,suddenly turns into this huge fight.
00:09:52.675,00:09:55.803,"And who wants a big, emotional scene like that?"
00:09:55.887,00:09:58.097,I’m so– I’m so relieved you understand.
00:09:58.181,00:10:00.433,I invited them over for dinner tonight.
00:10:01.935,00:10:03.602,What?
00:10:03.686,00:10:05.980,This would have gone on forever. You’re an avoider.
00:10:06.064,00:10:08.649,"No. No. No. Cam, I’m calling them right now and canceling."
00:10:08.733,00:10:12.403,"No, you’re not. You’re telling your family you adopted a baby, tonight."
00:10:12.487,00:10:15.656,And you do have avoidance issues. Even Longinus said so.
00:10:15.740,00:10:18.493,Are– Are you really not hearing these names?
00:10:30.880,00:10:33.299,"Hi. Hey, you must be Dylan."
00:10:33.383,00:10:35.968,Hey. Dylan. Yeah.
00:10:36.052,00:10:37.178,Hey.
00:10:37.262,00:10:39.472,Come on. Let’s go.
00:10:39.556,00:10:41.932,Hang on one second. Um– Whoa.
00:10:42.016,00:10:45.478,"Dylan, you’re still in high school?"
00:10:45.562,00:10:47.980,"Yeah, I’m a senior."
00:10:48.064,00:10:52.943,"Hey, Phil. Sweetie. Honey. He is Dylan, and he is a senior."
00:10:55.864,00:10:58.616,Let me meet this playa.
00:10:58.700,00:11:00.702,"Phil Dunphy, yo."
00:11:05.039,00:11:09.502,"It’s like that. You just–- You just stare down at ’em, let the eyes do the work."
00:11:09.586,00:11:13.547,"Your mouth might be saying, Hey, we cool, but your eyes are like, No, we not."
00:11:13.631,00:11:16.426,"Nice to meet you. No, it’s not."
00:11:17.552,00:11:19.178,It’s all good.
00:11:21.431,00:11:22.599,Yo.
00:11:24.100,00:11:26.602,"Okay, I see you two guys– Wait, wait, wait."
00:11:26.686,00:11:33.859,"You two– You two keep it real, know what I mean, son?"
00:11:33.943,00:11:35.694,Not really.
00:11:35.778,00:11:37.780,"Please, stop."
00:11:37.864,00:11:40.491,"Ow. Oh, God! That’s my back."
00:11:40.575,00:11:42.868,Ow! Oh! I slipped in the baby oil.
00:11:42.952,00:11:46.163,"Oh, where you from originally?"
00:11:46.247,00:11:49.792,I could defeat you if it came to a physical confrontation.
00:11:49.876,00:11:52.586,Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
00:11:52.670,00:11:55.422,"No, no, no, no, no. Okay."
00:11:55.506,00:11:57.758,"You’re very strong, homes. Thanks."
00:11:57.842,00:12:00.636,Okay. Nice– Nice soft landing.
00:12:00.720,00:12:03.180,Okay. I am on my side though.
00:12:05.975,00:12:07.726,We’ll be good.
00:12:07.810,00:12:17.737,"I just need to get flipped right on my back, and we should be fine. So– Brenda Feldman."
00:12:19.238,00:12:21.907,What is that?
00:12:21.991,00:12:26.745,- Of course it is. - I put my thoughts into words and now my words into action.
00:12:26.829,00:12:29.290,"Hey, I’ll give you 50 bucks not to do this."
00:12:29.374,00:12:32.001,I’m 11 years old. What am I gonna do with money?
00:12:32.085,00:12:34.253,What are you gonna do with a 16-year-old?
00:12:34.337,00:12:38.924,He’s like a bullfighter.
00:12:39.008,00:12:41.886,- I can’t watch this. - You’re in such a bad mood.
00:12:41.970,00:12:45.431,And I know why. It’s because that man thought you were my father.
00:12:45.515,00:12:46.932,No.
00:12:47.016,00:12:50.227,"No. When you say No like that, it’s always Yes."
00:12:50.311,00:12:53.606,"Come on. We’re in the mall. Let’s get you, like, some younger clothes."
00:12:53.690,00:12:56.692,There’s a store there.
00:12:56.776,00:13:00.195,And I don’t care what some jackass in a pair of ripped jeans thinks about me.
00:13:00.279,00:13:01.947,Good. You shouldn’t.
00:13:02.031,00:13:04.158,You should only care what I think.
00:13:04.242,00:13:06.911,"I love you, and I don’t care how old you are."
00:13:06.995,00:13:10.289,So stop being a gloomy goose and stop being so hard on Manny.
00:13:10.373,00:13:12.291,The only reason I’m hard on Manny...
00:13:12.375,00:13:14.960,is just because I don’t wanna see him make a fool of himself.
00:13:15.044,00:13:18.047,And I can smell that hair goo of his from here.
00:13:18.131,00:13:21.091,"Look, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to him over there."
00:13:21.175,00:13:29.516,"But you’re his family now, and that means only one thing– You be the wind in his back, not the spit in his face."
00:13:29.600,00:13:32.436,What?
00:13:32.520,00:13:35.815,"It’s gorgeous in Spanish. Look, he’s there."
00:13:40.445,00:13:44.657,She has a boyfriend.
00:13:44.741,00:13:49.954,"I gave her my heart, she gave me a picture of me as an old-time sheriff."
00:13:50.038,00:13:51.497,Oh.
00:13:51.581,00:13:54.833,"That was pretty stupid of me, wasn’t it?"
00:13:54.917,00:13:57.211,"It was brave. Right, Jay? Brave."
00:13:58.254,00:14:00.381,"W-Well, you’ll know better next time."
00:14:00.465,00:14:02.425,Come on. Let’s get a pretzel.
00:14:04.927,00:14:06.971,Mentira. A mí sí me gusta.
00:14:10.183,00:14:13.728,"Uh, excuse me, sir. We ask that all mall-walkers stay to the right."
00:14:30.495,00:14:32.413,"Alex, leave your sister alone."
00:14:32.497,00:14:34.206,I was just getting my book. Gosh.
00:14:34.290,00:14:37.918,"I know, sweetie. But you need to respect their privacy."
00:14:38.002,00:14:40.254,What are they doing up there?
00:14:40.338,00:14:43.716,"Lying on her bed, watching a movie."
00:14:43.800,00:14:46.301,Okay. Okay.
00:14:46.385,00:14:50.639,"Um, I’m making a cake for tonight. You wanna help me with the frosting?"
00:14:50.723,00:14:52.474,Sure.
00:14:52.558,00:15:00.733,"So, you know, if Haley got pregnant, would you ever pretend she has mono for a few months, and then, like, tell everyone the baby’s yours?"
00:15:00.817,00:15:07.865,"What? This senior at school was out sick for four months, but Jenna Resnick swears she saw her breast-feeding at a coin-op car wash."
00:15:13.579,00:15:15.831,"Buddy, what are you wearing?"
00:15:15.915,00:15:18.834,- Nothing. - Uh-uh. No jacket.
00:15:18.918,00:15:22.629,One hat. How many pairs of underwear do you have on?
00:15:26.551,00:15:29.428,"First of all, it would be really cool to see Haley that fat."
00:15:29.512,00:15:33.098,And how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who’s really my nephew.
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.895,Just saying if.
00:15:37.979,00:15:41.690,"And I know you like to make trouble for your sister, but it’s not gonna work this time."
00:15:41.774,00:15:44.651,You know why? ’Cause your sister’s a good girl.
00:15:44.735,00:15:51.492,"I know. I was just like her when I was– I want you to know, I’m not enjoying this."
00:15:51.576,00:15:53.994,But this is an important lesson that you’re learning.
00:15:54.078,00:15:56.622,"So, soak it. Keep it."
00:15:59.208,00:16:01.293,You’re too close. It’s gonna hurt.
00:16:01.377,00:16:03.128,It’s supposed to hurt.
00:16:03.212,00:16:06.632,- And why are you smiling? - I’m– What?
00:16:18.352,00:16:20.979,"Oh, forget it. I can’t do this."
00:16:21.063,00:16:23.273,The point is you’re scared. I think you’ve learned your lesson.
00:16:23.357,00:16:24.316,Wow.
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.026,Ow!
00:16:26.736,00:16:29.113,Mom! What are you doing?
00:16:29.197,00:16:31.865,"Oh, hey! I was just, um, dropping off some laundry."
00:16:31.949,00:16:33.909,- Is this a bad time? - Yeah.
00:16:33.993,00:16:37.246,Oh. Okay.
00:16:37.330,00:16:38.914,"Uh, can you shut the door, please?"
00:16:38.998,00:16:42.000,"Actually, we’re just gonna go ahead and leave that open."
00:16:42.084,00:16:43.335,Why?
00:16:43.419,00:16:49.049,"Because I have, uh, seen this little show before– lying on the bed with a tall senior."
00:16:49.133,00:16:54.012,"One minute you’re just friends, watching Falcon Crest, and the next you’re lying underneath the air hockey table with your bra in your pocket."
00:16:54.096,00:16:55.514,Whoa.
00:16:58.476,00:17:02.020,- I thought you were my friend! - I am your friend.
00:17:02.104,00:17:04.189,"Dad! Dad, Dad. You have got to talk to Mom."
00:17:04.273,00:17:07.067,"She is, like, completely freaking out and embarrassing me!"
00:17:07.151,00:17:11.613,"Honey, your mom isn’t always as cool about things as– What is with this thing?"
00:17:11.697,00:17:13.282,Ow!
00:17:15.368,00:17:20.831,"My dad. Uh, my dad still isn’t completely comfortable with this."
00:17:20.915,00:17:23.625,Um– He-He still does this thing. It’s been five years now.
00:17:23.709,00:17:26.170,And he still does this thing where he announces himself...
00:17:26.254,00:17:28.213,before walking into any room we’re in...
00:17:28.297,00:17:31.884,just to make sure he doesn’t have to ever see us kiss.
00:17:31.968,00:17:34.136,Wish my mother had that system.
00:17:34.220,00:17:36.471,Remember?
00:17:36.555,00:17:38.724,I still can’t believe you did this to me.
00:17:38.808,00:17:42.686,Would you get in the spirit of things? It’s a celebration.
00:17:45.731,00:17:48.901,"- Oh, God. - Okay, I’m gonna go get Lily ready."
00:17:48.985,00:17:51.987,Okay.
00:17:52.071,00:17:53.739,All right.
00:17:53.823,00:17:55.073,Yeah.
00:17:55.157,00:17:56.325,No.
00:17:56.409,00:17:58.744,Cam. Oh! All right. Go.
00:17:58.828,00:18:00.788,Sorry.
00:18:05.835,00:18:07.920,Hey. Hi.
00:18:08.004,00:18:10.422,"How are you? Hi, guys."
00:18:10.506,00:18:12.549,"That looks good. Oh, thank you. Thanks."
00:18:12.633,00:18:14.593,Don’t thank us. Open it. Dad is coming right behind.
00:18:18.931,00:18:21.767,"Don’t worry, Dad. Nothing gay going on here."
00:18:21.851,00:18:24.436,May I take your multicolored coat and bejeweled cap?
00:18:24.520,00:18:26.939,Yeah. Yeah.
00:18:27.023,00:18:29.900,"Gloria, hi."
00:18:29.984,00:18:32.611,"How are you? Hi, Dad."
00:18:32.695,00:18:35.656,"Oh, what a beautiful dress. Ay, thank you, Phil."
00:18:35.740,00:18:39.117,Okay.
00:18:39.201,00:18:41.745,That’s how she says Phil. Not feel. Phil.
00:18:41.829,00:18:44.373,- So how was your trip? - It was good. It was good actually.
00:18:44.457,00:18:48.627,"But, um, about that, I– I have something that I need to tell you guys."
00:18:48.711,00:18:51.004,"Um– Uh, we didn’t just go to Vietnam for pleasure."
00:18:51.088,00:18:53.465,"We, uh, kind of have some big news."
00:18:53.549,00:18:56.343,"Oh, God. If Cam comes out here with boobs, I’m leaving."
00:18:59.055,00:19:02.349,"Oh, don’t mind her. Haley had her first boy over today..."
00:19:02.433,00:19:04.393,and Phil shot him.
00:19:05.561,00:19:13.360,"Anyway, um, so, about– about a year ago, Cam and I started feeling this longing, you know, for something more, like, uh, maybe a baby?"
00:19:13.444,00:19:15.904,"- Ooh, that’s a bad idea. - What do you mean, bad idea?"
00:19:15.988,00:19:19.658,"Well, kids need a mother. I mean if you two guys are bored, get a dog."
00:19:19.742,00:19:21.868,"Okay, we’re not bored, Dad."
00:19:21.952,00:19:24.246,"I support you, Mitchell, even though you’re not my son."
00:19:24.330,00:19:26.665,I-I-I-I think what Dad is trying to say...
00:19:26.749,00:19:29.835,"is that, Mitchell, you’re a little uptight."
00:19:29.919,00:19:33.171,"- Kids bring chaos, and– and you don’t handle it well. - That’s not what Dad’s saying."
00:19:33.255,00:19:36.341,That’s what you’re saying. And it’s insulting in a whole different way.
00:19:36.425,00:19:39.011,"Okay, people. Let’s all chillax."
00:19:39.095,00:19:41.847,"Hey, where’s Uncle Cameron?"
00:19:41.931,00:19:44.599,Someone who’s not insulting me notices he’s not here.
00:19:44.683,00:19:48.520,"Oh, so that’s the big announcement, huh? You two broke up."
00:19:48.604,00:19:50.605,"Well– Well, a baby wasn’t gonna help that anyway."
00:19:50.689,00:19:54.443,"And let me tell you. You’re better off, because he was a bit of a drama queen."
00:19:54.527,00:19:56.028,"No, no, no. Stop. Stop. No."
00:19:56.112,00:20:20.052,"You come into my house and you insult me and my boyfriend, who, by the way, is not that dramatic– We adopted a baby."
00:20:20.136,00:20:21.595,Her name is Lily.
00:20:21.679,00:20:24.514,Exciting!
00:20:24.598,00:20:26.892,I can’t turn it off. It’s who I am.
00:20:26.976,00:20:28.977,The music.
00:20:30.855,00:20:34.733,"Ay, miren a la princesita. The little princess."
00:20:34.817,00:20:36.651,So cute.
00:20:39.822,00:20:41.740,"Hi there, Lily."
00:20:41.824,00:20:44.618,Lily. Isn’t that gonna be hard for her to say?
00:20:44.702,00:20:47.245,Phil.
00:20:47.329,00:20:50.582,"Okay, I-I-I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea."
00:20:50.666,00:20:55.170,"But, uh, what do I know?"
00:20:55.254,00:20:57.756,"I mean, it’s not like I wrote the book on fatherhood."
00:20:57.840,00:21:01.426,Been trying all my life to get it right. I’m still screwing up.
00:21:01.510,00:21:04.471,"- Right, Manny? - I wrote a song about it in the car."
00:21:04.555,00:21:17.609,"Of course you did. Uh– Anyway, I’m happy for you. And, uh, you should know that, uh, I’m not here to spit in your face, I’m here to... blow at your back."
00:21:17.693,00:21:19.778,I don’t understand what that means.
00:21:17.693,00:21:23.115,"I don’t– Well, it’s– it’s supposed to sound better in Spanish."
00:21:23.199,00:21:27.536,"Voy a ser la brisa en tu espalda, no quien te escupa en la frente."
00:21:27.620,00:21:29.871,"Oh, that’s beautiful."
00:21:29.955,00:21:32.749,And thank you too.
00:21:32.833,00:21:39.506,"Anyhow, Mitch, uh– I got her. I got her."
00:21:39.590,00:21:41.091,She wants her grandpa!
00:21:41.175,00:21:43.301,Do you wanna meet Grandpa?
00:21:43.385,00:21:47.305,She’s one of us now. Let me see the little pot sticker.
00:21:47.389,00:21:50.851,"Hey, you’re a cutie, aren’t you?"
00:21:50.935,00:21:54.396,Ah. Look at this.
00:21:59.235,00:22:04.698,"Love is what binds us, through fair or stormy weather."
00:22:04.782,00:22:12.540,"I stand before you now with only one agenda– To let you know my heart is yours, Feldman comma Brenda."
00:22:13.874,00:22:16.502,"I mean, seriously."
00:22:17.920,00:22:21.173,"Luke, so far, hasn’t beaten me in basketball."
00:22:21.257,00:22:23.425,It’s 2-0. 2-0.
00:22:25.803,00:22:28.930,Get that weak stuff out of my kitchen!
00:22:29.014,00:22:33.602,Can you do me a favor? Just grab– Ooh! How’s the weather down there?
00:22:33.686,00:22:42.402,"But when the day comes that he does win– if– you know– if/when– he beats me, I’m just gonna be like, Well done. Well done."
00:22:42.486,00:22:44.779,"Just, like, let him– Just support him..."
00:22:44.863,00:22:46.781,in– in– in that kind of stuff.
00:22:46.865,00:00:05.422,"I mean, I’d probably want to go, like, two out of three and just see what happens there, but– Jay &amp; Gloria Mitchell &amp; Cameron Phil Claire &amp; Phil Jay &amp; Gloria What’s the key to being a great dad?"
00:00:07.174,00:00:09.843,"Ah, that’s a tough one."
00:00:09.927,00:00:12.178,Mitchell &amp; Cameron Giving them the freedom to be whatever they want to be.
00:00:12.262,00:00:14.013,Right. Exactly.
00:00:12.262,00:00:20.103,"Whether that’s a painter, a poet, a pilot, a president– And for us, we’re gonna– of a company or of a country."
00:00:23.106,00:00:25.025,Patience.
00:00:26.068,00:00:28.111,"Phil Well, be their buddy."
00:00:28.195,00:00:30.947,Claire &amp; Phil That’s your answer?
00:00:31.031,00:00:32.782,No.
00:00:32.866,00:00:34.367,No!
00:00:34.451,00:00:36.453,"Oh, God."
00:00:39.539,00:00:41.208,Still thinking.
00:00:58.850,00:01:00.768,"Hi, Claire."
00:01:00.852,00:01:02.562,Hey.
00:01:02.646,00:01:05.857,"Hi. Um, this is my husband, Phil."
00:01:05.941,00:01:08.526,Hi.
00:01:08.610,00:01:10.528,This is– Desiree.
00:01:10.612,00:01:12.530,"Desiree, right. Sorry."
00:01:12.614,00:01:15.074,Desiree just moved in down the block.
00:01:15.158,00:01:16.826,314.
00:01:16.910,00:01:19.287,The two-bedroom cottage with the indoor-outdoor family room.
00:01:19.371,00:01:23.625,Very good. How did you– Bet you’re lovin’ that steam shower.
00:01:23.709,00:01:27.003,"Oh, sorry. I’m a– I’m a real estate mogul."
00:01:27.087,00:01:29.714,"What? No, I’m a– I am a real estate agent."
00:01:29.798,00:01:32.091,"We caravanned that house. Great, uh, deck."
00:01:32.175,00:01:35.428,Thanks. I’m just there till my divorce is final.
00:01:35.512,00:01:37.972,"Now, who is coconuts enough to divorce you?"
00:01:38.056,00:01:40.600,"We gotta go, but we’ll see you around."
00:01:40.684,00:01:42.602,We’ll have to have you over sometime.
00:01:42.686,00:01:44.395,I’d love it.
00:01:44.479,00:01:46.272,Bye.
00:01:46.356,00:01:49.150,She’s awesome.
00:01:49.234,00:01:51.694,Heard she already slept with two dads from the school.
00:01:51.778,00:01:53.446,What?
00:01:53.530,00:01:55.157,That’s horrible.
00:01:56.575,00:01:58.701,"Dad, watch out!"
00:01:58.785,00:02:00.453,I’m sorry.
00:02:00.537,00:02:02.956,That still looks like a girl’s bike.
00:02:03.040,00:02:04.958,We’ll add more black tape.
00:02:07.878,00:02:10.838,Until he’s responsible enough to take care of his own bike.
00:02:10.922,00:02:16.052,"Look, he spilled a soda on my computer, he ruined our digital camera taking pictures of himself underwater."
00:02:16.136,00:02:18.346,It’s a girl’s bike. I’m all for teaching him a lesson.
00:02:18.430,00:02:22.850,But I worry about the ridicule he might get from some loudmouth bully.
00:02:26.897,00:02:30.441,- Dad! - Come on. He looks like Little Bo Peep on that thing.
00:02:30.525,00:02:32.860,"Actually, not for long. He’s getting a new bike this afternoon."
00:02:32.944,00:02:34.612,I am?
00:02:34.696,00:02:36.823,He is?
00:02:39.910,00:02:44.289,And if the old lady don’t like it– Honey?
00:02:46.083,00:02:48.167,That’s too damn bad.
00:02:51.171,00:02:53.631,"Cam, come on. Hurry up. We’re gonna be late."
00:02:53.715,00:02:56.509,"It’s a toddler play class, not a flight to Cabo."
00:02:56.593,00:02:58.594,We’re gonna be judged enough as the only gay parents there.
00:02:58.678,00:03:00.179,I don’t wanna be the late ones too.
00:03:00.263,00:03:02.849,Wow! Paisley and pink.
00:03:02.933,00:03:04.851,Was there something wrong with the fishnet tank top?
00:03:04.935,00:03:07.186,Obviously not. I’m wearing it underneath.
00:03:07.270,00:03:09.856,"Kidding. Just chill, please. Here."
00:03:09.940,00:03:12.108,I’m sorry. I just wanna make a good first impression.
00:03:12.192,00:03:14.527,You wanna fit in and not terrify the villagers?
00:03:14.611,00:03:16.904,"Today is about Lily, all right?"
00:03:16.988,00:03:21.159,"Her future best friend might be in that class, and I don’t wanna rub anyone the wrong way."
00:03:21.243,00:03:24.370,Can you please just change your shirt?
00:03:24.454,00:03:30.001,"Fine. You know what? I’ll just go put on a pair of khakis, maybe a polo shirt, and everybody will think we’re a couple straight golfin’ buddies..."
00:03:30.085,00:03:32.211,who just decided to have a kid together.
00:03:34.297,00:03:38.760,"Hey, I called that place in Napa and got us upgraded to a villa with a hot tub."
00:03:38.844,00:03:42.263,So pack whatever you wear in a hot tub.
00:03:42.347,00:03:45.391,I usually wear nothing when I’m in a hot tub.
00:03:45.475,00:03:48.102,And my college roommate’s wife just had to get a new hip.
00:03:48.186,00:03:50.063,Sucker.
00:03:50.147,00:03:55.735,"Manny’s father is taking him for a couple of days to Disneyland, so we’re gonna go to the wine country."
00:03:55.819,00:03:58.571,"We’re gonna drink some wine, eat some good food."
00:03:58.655,00:04:03.076,"You know, we would do something like this a lot more often if it wasn’t for, you know, Manny."
00:04:03.160,00:04:06.746,He’s good. He keep us grounded.
00:04:06.830,00:04:09.082,Like fog at an airport.
00:04:09.166,00:04:12.418,"Limo gets here at 4:00. This morning, I thought I’d go to the club, hit a few balls."
00:04:12.502,00:04:14.796,No! What about the fan in Manny’s room?
00:04:14.880,00:04:17.423,"Oh, yeah. Call a guy."
00:04:17.507,00:04:20.134,No! You’re supposed to do it with him.
00:04:20.218,00:04:23.262,It’s important that we teach him how to do things for himself.
00:04:23.346,00:04:25.932,"In my culture, men take great pride in doing physical labor."
00:04:26.016,00:04:29.769,I know. That’s why I hire people from your culture.
00:04:33.315,00:04:37.110,I’m gonna share that one with my next husband when we’re spending all your money.
00:04:38.612,00:04:42.281,"Dad, this is the coolest bike ever."
00:04:42.365,00:04:44.367,"So, listen, buddy."
00:04:44.451,00:04:48.788,Certain members of this family don’t think you can take care of this bad boy.
00:04:48.872,00:04:51.124,You mean Mom?
00:04:51.208,00:05:00.007,"Look, uh, your mom and I are a team, and she– we feel like this is a chance for you to show some responsibility."
00:05:00.091,00:05:02.427,Don’t make us look like jerks here.
00:05:02.511,00:05:04.595,I won’t.
00:05:04.679,00:05:06.639,One more rule.
00:05:06.723,00:05:09.308,"Have, like, three butt-loads of fun."
00:05:09.392,00:05:11.520,"Thanks, Dad."
00:05:19.903,00:05:22.697,"- So let’s do this. - Okay, but I need to be done by 3:00."
00:05:22.781,00:05:24.740,That’s when my dad’s picking me up.
00:05:24.824,00:05:28.161,"Hey, if we’re not done by 3:00, I’m gonna tie a noose on this thing."
00:05:29.829,00:05:36.043,"If you have two stubborn burros that don’t like each other, you tie them to the same cart."
00:05:36.127,00:05:38.754,The ceiling fan is the cart.
00:05:38.838,00:05:41.340,My dad’s taking me on Space Mountain.
00:05:41.424,00:05:44.385,"It’s supposed to be really fast, but he’s not scared of anything."
00:05:44.469,00:05:48.014,He doesn’t even wear a seat belt when he drives.
00:05:48.098,00:05:51.768,- Killed a bear once. - Really? Was the bear sittin’ in the passenger seat?
00:05:52.978,00:05:55.771,Read me the instructions.
00:05:55.855,00:06:01.986,Safety tips. Warning: to reduce the risk of electrical shock– We can skip that.
00:06:02.070,00:06:05.364,"Uh, Failure to heed these warnings can lead to serious injury or death."
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.533,"You know, you worry too much. You know that."
00:06:07.617,00:06:09.202,Nobody’s gonna get shocked.
00:06:09.286,00:06:11.537,One time my dad was struck by lightning.
00:06:11.621,00:06:14.248,That’s why he can drink as much as he wants.
00:06:16.793,00:06:19.420,The truth? He’s a total flake.
00:06:19.504,00:06:21.714,"In fact, the only way he’s like Superman..."
00:06:21.798,00:06:24.383,is that they both landed in this country illegally.
00:06:26.970,00:06:28.930,I can’t believe I’m so nervous.
00:06:29.014,00:06:31.015,They’re gonna love us. Let’s just be ourselves.
00:06:31.099,00:06:33.309,Or a slightly toned-down version of ourselves.
00:06:33.393,00:06:36.395,I just don’t want this to become an episode of The Cam Show.
00:06:36.479,00:06:38.397,"Oh, my gosh. People love The Cam Show."
00:06:38.481,00:06:40.107,You watch The Cam Show.
00:06:40.191,00:06:41.984,It’s appointment viewing.
00:06:42.068,00:06:44.070,Hi!
00:06:44.154,00:06:46.614,Yes. I-I’m Mitchell. This is Cameron.
00:06:46.698,00:06:48.741,And this here is Lily.
00:06:48.825,00:06:50.993,"Oh, well! Welcome."
00:06:51.077,00:06:53.663,- We’re all over here taking turns blowing bubbles. - Oh!
00:06:53.747,00:06:57.959,"Well, how nice for... the babies."
00:07:01.671,00:07:03.631,This is gonna be really difficult.
00:07:15.352,00:07:18.688,"Ten minutes after making a promise to me, he leaves his bike unlocked."
00:07:18.772,00:07:26.320,All I can hear is Claire’s voice in my head– You never should have given him a bike.
00:07:26.404,00:07:29.198,I know. I do a pretty good Claire.
00:07:29.282,00:07:32.410,So I decided to teach him a lesson...
00:07:32.494,00:07:35.496,and let him think his bike was stolen.
00:07:35.580,00:07:39.959,"And I know that sounds kind of rough, but sometimes it’s a dad’s job to be the tough guy."
00:07:40.043,00:07:41.752,Excuse me! Thank you.
00:07:41.836,00:07:43.713,On your left! My left. Your right!
00:07:45.799,00:07:50.761,"Everyone, we have a new family joining us today."
00:07:50.845,00:07:54.724,"Hi. I’m, uh, Mitchell, and I am a lawyer."
00:07:54.808,00:08:04.650,"I– I’m Cameron, and I’m currently not working, which gives me more time to grill and shoot baskets and– And this is Lily."
00:08:04.734,00:08:11.991,"Okay, we’re gonna start with the Hello Dance, and then we’re gonna move on to blocks, then finger painting, and then we’re gonna do our Family Dance."
00:08:12.075,00:08:14.076,All right. Who wants to start us off?
00:08:21.751,00:08:24.295,She’s adorable.
00:08:24.379,00:08:26.255,Seven months?
00:08:26.339,00:08:29.425,Oh! Is she grabbing or scooting yet?
00:08:29.509,00:08:31.510,Yes. Absolutely.
00:08:31.594,00:08:34.639,"I mean, when she’s not grabbin’, she is– she is scootin’."
00:08:34.723,00:08:37.058,"Dance us in, Tyler!"
00:08:39.894,00:08:42.688,Whoo! Oh!
00:08:42.772,00:08:45.775,"Cam, Lily is not grabbing or scooting yet."
00:08:45.859,00:08:48.653,"Well, she’s not doing it yet, but she will eventually."
00:08:48.737,00:08:51.781,"No, but, see, a lot of these other kids, they’re– they’re grabbing."
00:08:51.865,00:08:56.869,"I-I just– Here. Come– Lily. Look at the block, huh? Grab the block, Lily. Grab the H."
00:08:56.953,00:08:59.038,"Dance us in, Lily!"
00:08:59.122,00:09:00.873,Okay. I got this.
00:08:59.122,00:09:03.959,"Cam, just– Yes, I know. Tamp down my natural gifts and dance like a straight guy."
00:09:04.043,00:09:07.297,No slapping your own butt.
00:09:22.687,00:09:24.897,That was very good.
00:09:30.153,00:09:32.279,"Oh, hey."
00:09:32.363,00:09:34.323,Hi.
00:09:34.407,00:09:37.910,"Uh, this is really embarrassing, but I locked myself out of my house."
00:09:37.994,00:09:42.164,Oh! Pssh! I do that all the time. Don’t be embarrassed.
00:09:42.248,00:09:44.583,I was– I was hoping you could help me.
00:09:44.667,00:09:46.752,"There’s a window open, but I can’t reach it."
00:09:46.836,00:09:48.838,Would you mind?
00:09:51.841,00:09:54.218,Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
00:09:54.302,00:10:00.224,"Of course. You know what they say– Every time God closes a door, he opens a window."
00:10:00.308,00:10:03.853,"Or I guess in this case, every time he locks you out. Okay, what do we got here?"
00:10:03.937,00:10:06.856,"I mean, am I attracted to her? Yes."
00:10:06.940,00:10:09.191,Would I ever act on it? No. No way.
00:10:09.275,00:10:12.486,Not while my wife is still alive.
00:10:12.570,00:10:14.864,Are you sure I can’t get you something to drink?
00:10:14.948,00:10:16.949,"Yeah. No, I’m– I’m fine. Really."
00:10:17.033,00:10:20.995,"If I knew a man was gonna climb into my bedroom window, I would have cleaned up a bit."
00:10:21.079,00:10:23.289,Are you kidding me? It smelled great in there.
00:10:23.373,00:10:25.332,Like lotions and oils...
00:10:25.416,00:10:28.085,"for... dry skin and, you know, calloused hands."
00:10:28.169,00:10:30.087,"Yeah, it’s a candle."
00:10:30.171,00:10:32.173,Uh-oh.
00:10:36.052,00:10:38.429,Can I help you find it?
00:10:38.513,00:10:40.390,Okay. Thank you!
00:10:42.100,00:10:49.315,"So, to teach him a lesson, I took his bike, and then– crazy thing– I put it down for one minute, and someone swiped it from me."
00:10:49.399,00:10:52.109,Maybe that was your dad teaching you a lesson.
00:10:55.697,00:11:00.159,"So, any chance I could, uh, get a break on this one?"
00:11:00.243,00:11:02.203,I can throw in a bell– Deal.
00:11:02.287,00:11:04.163,for five dollars.
00:11:04.247,00:11:08.334,"So, you wanna go for the insurance this time, or is it still for suckers?"
00:11:11.212,00:11:13.964,"Well played, milord."
00:11:14.048,00:11:16.217,I will take some insurance. Thank you.
00:11:16.301,00:11:19.428,What’s going on in there?
00:11:19.512,00:11:21.430,That’s not step four.
00:11:21.514,00:11:24.099,It says right here that you should– That’s worrying about it.
00:11:24.183,00:11:26.352,I thought you guys might need a drink.
00:11:26.436,00:11:28.395,"Oh, you have no idea."
00:11:28.479,00:11:31.649,"Manny, mi amor, I have to go get some stuff for our trip."
00:11:31.733,00:11:35.319,"¡Ay! But have some fun with your father, okay? And I’ll see you Monday."
00:11:35.403,00:11:40.032,Mwah! It makes me so happy to see my two boys working together.
00:11:40.116,00:11:42.493,Jay shocked himself twice.
00:11:42.577,00:11:45.496,"Well, I warned him."
00:11:45.580,00:11:48.541,Look at you two with your private jokes already.
00:11:48.625,00:11:51.585,You’re a regular Salazar and El Oso.
00:11:51.669,00:11:54.255,It’s a very big comedy team in Colombia.
00:11:54.339,00:11:57.883,El Oso is always hitting Salazar in the head with the ladder and things.
00:11:57.967,00:12:00.386,And sometimes they wear dresses. Hmm.
00:12:00.470,00:12:04.098,"They make you laugh, but they also make you think."
00:12:06.017,00:12:08.394,You blew it. You made me look bad.
00:12:08.478,00:12:11.981,"No, you made your mother and I look bad. We are a team."
00:12:13.149,00:12:15.067,"Luke, you in there?"
00:12:17.528,00:12:20.739,"That was, uh– That was pretty fun today, huh? Getting a new bike."
00:12:20.823,00:12:24.451,"Yeah, it was awesome."
00:12:24.535,00:12:27.162,Anything you want to share with me?
00:12:27.246,00:12:32.794,"So, if I, uh, went out to the garage, took a picture for a scrapbook, there’d be no surprises?"
00:12:34.170,00:12:38.090,I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean it. I just made a mistake.
00:12:38.174,00:12:41.010,"Yeah, a big mistake! You’re making me look really bad here."
00:12:41.094,00:12:43.095,I told Mom you were ready for this.
00:12:43.179,00:12:45.931,"- It’s just a scratch, Dad. - That’s not the point, Luke! What?"
00:12:46.015,00:12:49.643,I scratched it on my way into the driveway. I’m sorry.
00:12:49.727,00:12:52.271,"So, it’s not stolen?"
00:12:52.355,00:12:54.690,No. Why?
00:13:02.031,00:13:04.408,You sit there and think about the scratch part. That’s not good either.
00:13:04.492,00:13:06.118,I gotta fix that step.
00:13:06.202,00:13:09.622,"So don’t scratch anything while I’m gone, unless it itches. That’s different."
00:13:09.706,00:13:13.959,"The good news is, Luke has his bike."
00:13:14.043,00:13:19.548,More good news– I taught some random kid a valuable lesson by stealing his bike.
00:13:19.632,00:13:22.593,Best news– Claire knows nothing.
00:13:22.677,00:13:26.931,"So, I figure I’ll just dump the new bike where I stole the first bike."
00:13:27.015,00:13:31.977,"That way, random kid gets his back, and this new bike doesn’t raise a lot of embarrassing questions..."
00:13:32.061,00:13:36.023,like why I had it or who boosted who through a bedroom window.
00:13:36.107,00:13:38.984,"So, everybody’s happy."
00:13:39.068,00:13:41.820,Uh-oh.
00:13:41.904,00:13:45.324,"Ah, son of a– You gave me the wrong screwdriver."
00:13:45.408,00:13:47.409,Maybe you’re just using it wrong.
00:13:47.493,00:13:51.121,My dad’s great with tools. He can get the wheels off a car in less than a minute.
00:13:54.083,00:13:55.793,Ow!
00:13:55.877,00:13:58.420,I think my arm is broken.
00:13:58.504,00:14:00.589,How do you know? You don’t know anything.
00:14:00.673,00:14:02.591,You have no concern for safety.
00:14:02.675,00:14:05.302,Because it didn’t hit you that hard.
00:14:05.386,00:14:08.389,You don’t want me around.
00:14:08.473,00:14:11.517,I don’t wanna be with you either. I’m gonna go wait for my dad.
00:14:11.601,00:14:14.687,"Oh, but– but if you leave, how will I ever finish?"
00:14:14.771,00:14:18.148,You know what? I wish you never married my mom.
00:14:18.232,00:14:20.693,I hate living here.
00:14:20.777,00:14:23.821,I got a two-seater parked in the driveway!
00:14:29.619,00:14:31.537,"I mean, I don’t understand."
00:14:31.621,00:14:33.956,Why are you trying to sneak around and hide things from me?
00:14:34.040,00:14:36.375,I actually think it’s pretty funny.
00:14:36.459,00:14:38.460,I do. Yes.
00:14:38.544,00:14:42.589,"I mean, you steal a bike from some poor kid, and then the bike gets stolen from you."
00:14:42.673,00:14:44.842,It’s hilarious.
00:14:44.926,00:14:46.927,"Classic me, right?"
00:14:47.011,00:14:50.514,"So, where were you when it got stolen?"
00:14:50.598,00:14:53.726,Uh-huh.
00:14:53.810,00:14:59.356,"Yep, but, uh, I went inside to get a soda because I was thirsty, and if I had a soda, I wouldn’t be thirsty anymore."
00:14:59.440,00:15:02.860,"So I bought one, then I drank it all right there, which is why I don’t have the can."
00:15:02.944,00:15:06.947,"Well, honey, please, let’s try to remember that I’m your wife, not your mom."
00:15:07.031,00:15:10.200,"So in the future, you don’t need to hide things from me. Okay?"
00:15:10.284,00:15:12.161,Okay.
00:15:12.245,00:15:15.039,Okay.
00:15:15.123,00:15:17.958,"You get back here, you!"
00:15:18.042,00:15:19.960,I just love ya so darn much!
00:15:20.044,00:15:22.421,"I know. I love you too, but that hurts."
00:15:22.505,00:15:24.590,Hi.
00:15:24.674,00:15:26.592,Hello! Hi there!
00:15:26.676,00:15:28.594,Hi again.
00:15:28.678,00:15:30.596,"I, uh, found your bike."
00:15:30.680,00:15:35.517,"Uh– Oh, good! You– At the gas station?"
00:15:35.601,00:15:45.360,"One of my neighbors saw it and put it in my garage when you were in my bedroom, so– Classic me?"
00:15:45.444,00:15:48.280,"Come on, honey. Grab the block."
00:15:48.364,00:15:50.616,"See, like he did. You gotta do that."
00:15:50.700,00:15:54.328,You gotta grab it like him.
00:15:54.412,00:15:56.080,"Uh, yeah."
00:15:56.164,00:16:04.129,"You know, my husband and I just rented, uh, Mamma Mia!, which I liked, but I don’t know that Meryl Streep was the right choice."
00:16:04.213,00:16:06.381,What did you think?
00:16:06.465,00:16:10.469,Excuse me. Meryl Streep could play Batman and be the right choice.
00:16:10.553,00:16:12.471,She’s perfection...
00:16:12.555,00:16:15.849,"whether she’s divorcing Kramer, whether she’s wearing Prada."
00:16:15.933,00:16:18.602,Don’t even get me started on Sophie’s Choice.
00:16:18.686,00:16:21.230,I get emotional thinking about it.
00:16:23.024,00:16:25.234,She couldn’t forgive herself.
00:16:29.739,00:16:31.824,I guess she was okay.
00:16:31.908,00:16:33.742,Really? Ooh.
00:16:33.826,00:16:35.494,Uh-uh-uh.
00:16:35.578,00:16:37.496,"Grab the blocks, sweetheart."
00:16:37.580,00:16:40.874,- You’re not even interested in it. - Is Henry stacking?
00:16:40.958,00:16:43.168,"Good job, Henry!"
00:16:43.252,00:16:45.171,Good job!
00:16:57.975,00:17:00.352,"Whoa, Lily! Oh!"
00:17:00.436,00:17:03.230,Not so high. Wow!
00:17:03.314,00:17:05.274,- That is a big moment for her. - Yeah.
00:17:05.358,00:17:07.234,Would you like a videotape?
00:17:07.318,00:17:13.866,"Uh, you know, I don’t– I don’t know if I can actually get her to do it again, so– Well, we tape all of our classes."
00:17:13.950,00:17:16.869,We don’t like parents bringing cameras in. It keeps them out of the moment.
00:17:16.953,00:17:18.745,I’ll get you a copy after class.
00:17:18.829,00:17:20.498,Great.
00:17:22.291,00:17:24.251,"Cam. Cam, let’s go."
00:17:24.335,00:17:27.504,"I don’t know what’s happened to me, but I just stole a baby’s intellectual property."
00:17:27.588,00:17:29.214,What?
00:17:29.298,00:17:33.135,"- Come on. Let’s just go. - Oh, look who’s here!"
00:17:33.219,00:17:35.304,Anton and Scott!
00:17:35.388,00:17:38.432,Don’t look at me. The eye candy here can’t leave the house...
00:17:38.516,00:17:40.726,without spending 20 minutes in front of the mirror.
00:17:40.810,00:17:43.061,Are you kidding me?
00:17:43.145,00:17:45.731,I am so sorry.
00:17:45.815,00:17:48.108,Look at those queens. I would have killed with this crowd.
00:17:48.192,00:17:50.986,But you had to clip my wings– which you used to be the wind beneath.
00:17:51.070,00:17:54.281,I know. I’m sor– This class has turned me into a complete monster.
00:17:54.365,00:17:56.783,I’m– I’m just– I’ll make it up to you. Let’s just go.
00:17:56.867,00:17:59.661,"Okay, it’s time for Parents Dance."
00:18:06.502,00:18:08.587,"You wanna do it, don’t you?"
00:18:08.671,00:18:10.297,I do.
00:18:10.381,00:18:12.257,I wanna dance for my baby.
00:18:12.341,00:18:14.301,All right. Go on. Get in there.
00:18:14.385,00:18:16.762,Make that horsey move. Go ahead.
00:18:25.229,00:18:28.274,"Go, go!"
00:18:36.824,00:18:38.951,"Oh, I think I hurt myself."
00:18:56.552,00:19:00.013,"Hello. Hey, Javier."
00:19:00.097,00:19:02.724,Manny’s waiting for you outside.
00:19:02.808,00:19:05.478,What? Why not?
00:19:06.937,00:19:09.022,Hold that thought.
00:19:12.943,00:19:19.575,"and Superman can’t drag himself away from a craps table, and I’m the jerk."
00:19:22.161,00:19:24.413,"Say, listen."
00:19:24.497,00:19:30.168,"I, uh– Sorry, but I got some bad news."
00:19:30.252,00:19:33.714,Your dad couldn’t make it.
00:19:33.798,00:19:39.553,"The plane was full, and this old lady needed to get home, so he gave up his seat."
00:19:39.637,00:19:41.596,"You’re making that up, aren’t you?"
00:19:41.680,00:19:43.557,He just didn’t want to come.
00:19:43.641,00:19:47.102,Are you kidding me? He was very upset. He was dying to see you.
00:19:49.313,00:19:51.315,"In fact, look what he sent."
00:19:52.691,00:19:54.693,A limo?
00:19:54.777,00:19:57.112,He wanted me and your mom to take you to Disneyland.
00:19:57.196,00:20:00.741,I told you he was an awesome dad.
00:20:02.284,00:20:04.829,Okay. The key to being a good dad?
00:20:06.622,00:20:09.708,"Look, sometimes things work out just the way you want."
00:20:09.792,00:20:13.504,Race you to the end.
00:20:20.636,00:20:27.768,"Because when all is said and done, 90% of being a dad..."
00:20:27.852,00:20:29.979,is just showin’ up.
00:20:42.491,00:20:46.412,Hey! That’s my bike!
00:20:42.491,00:20:53.669,"Oh, I don’t, uh– Well– I was giving it back!"
00:20:57.047,00:20:59.174,She couldn’t forgive herself.
00:20:59.258,00:21:03.595,And... she had to choose.
00:21:03.679,00:21:13.688,"I think because now I have– we have– we have– we have Lily, it’s so hard to imagine being put in that position."
00:21:13.772,00:21:21.696,"If I had to choose Lily or Mitchell, I mean, I would choose Li– I don’t know! I don’t know!"
00:21:23.782,00:21:25.659,I don’t know!
00:21:25.743,00:21:28.704,I don’t know!
00:00:03.921,00:00:05.839,Kelly at second. Started the inning with a double.
00:00:05.923,00:00:07.549,That seems like an hour ago.
00:00:07.633,00:00:10.093,"- Honey, I thought you were gonna take out the garbage. - I am."
00:00:10.177,00:00:14.556,"High fly to right. Hooking, hooking– Foul."
00:00:14.640,00:00:17.308,- Phil. - Yes. Getting it.
00:00:17.392,00:00:24.900,"Good guys trail 3-2, last of the ninth, one out– I was– I was gonna get it."
00:00:26.610,00:00:28.278,Dylan.
00:00:31.031,00:00:33.032,Did you ring the bell?
00:00:33.116,00:00:35.118,She said she’d be down in just a minute.
00:00:35.202,00:00:37.871,"Oh, great. Tell her I said Hi."
00:00:37.955,00:00:40.456,Dylan! D-Money!
00:00:40.540,00:00:42.709,Chillin’ with Dylan the villain!
00:00:42.793,00:00:44.794,"D to the Y to the– Hey, Mr. Dunphy."
00:00:44.878,00:00:46.045,Hey! Come on in.
00:00:46.129,00:00:48.047,You’re just in time to catch the end of the game.
00:00:48.131,00:00:49.799,"Oh, I’m not really a baseball guy."
00:00:51.468,00:00:53.636,I was just being facetious.
00:01:04.147,00:01:06.232,Okay. See that guy? He’s the tying run.
00:01:06.316,00:01:14.741,"Interesting story about him. He’s been stuck on second base forever, and I’m pretty sure he’s gonna try and steal third, which is just a terrible, terrible idea."
00:01:14.825,00:01:16.785,How are you and Haley doing?
00:01:23.375,00:01:26.085,I wish I could stay home with you and fly toy airplanes.
00:01:26.169,00:01:29.672,"These aren’t toy airplanes, Manny. These are models, and they’re very complicated."
00:01:29.756,00:01:36.971,"You wanna fly one of these, you gotta be familiar with airfoil, drag, lift and thrust– and these are all principles of aerodynamics."
00:01:37.055,00:01:38.765,The box says 12 and up.
00:01:38.849,00:01:40.976,What?
00:01:42.019,00:01:44.103,You can fly toy planes with Jay next time.
00:01:46.523,00:01:48.775,"Because his mother invited you, so you go."
00:01:48.859,00:01:50.860,"Family needs to be close. Right, Jay?"
00:01:50.944,00:01:53.279,I’m pretty sure this is a typo.
00:01:56.366,00:02:05.250,"Like hiking in the desert, that kind of skiing that they drop you from the– Helicopter."
00:02:05.334,00:02:08.253,"Once, on a dare, he even boxed with an alligator."
00:02:08.337,00:02:12.215,Wrestle. You wrestle– You can’t box with alligators.
00:02:12.299,00:02:16.135,Are you sure?
00:02:16.219,00:02:18.054,Aren’t they like tiny little hands?
00:02:18.138,00:02:20.056,No!
00:02:20.140,00:02:22.475,"Okay, now I forgot what we’re talking about."
00:02:20.140,00:02:27.105,"Anyways, hobbies are important for the men, whether you’re risking your life..."
00:02:27.189,00:02:30.233,or flying little planes from a safe distance.
00:02:35.405,00:02:38.449,"Uh, we’re just gonna buy some diapers. It’ll just take a second."
00:02:38.533,00:02:41.619,This is Costco.
00:02:41.703,00:02:43.121,Since when?
00:02:43.205,00:02:46.124,Do you remember when we adopted that baby a few months back?
00:02:46.208,00:02:49.836,Since then.
00:02:49.920,00:02:51.337,Mitchell is a snob.
00:02:51.421,00:02:54.132,"No. N-No, I-I’m discerning."
00:02:54.216,00:02:57.010,Official slogan for snobs.
00:02:57.094,00:02:59.137,"When we first met, he wouldn’t even look at me..."
00:02:59.221,00:03:03.391,"because I was a hick from the farm in Missouri, and he’s a big city mouse."
00:03:06.103,00:03:09.022,Country mice.
00:03:11.066,00:03:13.735,I think I’m gonna go wait in the car.
00:03:13.819,00:03:16.696,"- Hey, if you’re on your way out, can you grab the garbage? - I got it."
00:03:19.449,00:03:24.412,"- He’s a little jumpy. - Oh, go figure– a teenage boy doesn’t want to hang out with his girlfriend’s dad."
00:03:24.496,00:03:31.044,Thought we were past all that. I’m all about– I’m all about taking it to the next level.
00:03:31.128,00:03:33.129,Thought you were all about keeping it real.
00:03:33.213,00:03:36.382,But the whole point of keeping it real is so you can take it to the next level.
00:03:36.466,00:03:40.470,- Did you really not know that? - You haven’t exactly taken it to the next level with my dad.
00:03:42.347,00:03:45.975,"We’ve been married for 16 years, and you still walk on eggshells around him."
00:03:46.059,00:03:48.269,What? Are you kidding?
00:03:48.353,00:03:51.148,Jay and I are total buds.
00:03:54.734,00:03:57.111,You-You want to just hang out?
00:04:01.199,00:04:22.178,That’s– Manny brought his favorite game to play with Luke.
00:04:22.262,00:04:24.097,It’s called Empire.
00:04:24.181,00:04:26.849,You use strategy to expand territories and take over the world.
00:04:26.933,00:04:29.685,Luke is gonna love that. He’s out back playing.
00:04:29.769,00:04:32.397,Do you need me to get you something while I’m out shopping?
00:04:32.481,00:04:34.774,"That’s such a nice offer, but I think we’re good. Thanks."
00:04:37.194,00:04:39.362,You don’t even say Hello to Gloria and Manny?
00:04:39.446,00:04:42.782,"Hi, Gloria and Manny. Okay, Mom, what about this?"
00:04:42.866,00:04:46.160,No. You’re wearing a dress.
00:04:46.244,00:04:48.496,What? It’s gonna kill you to look like a girl for one afternoon?
00:04:48.580,00:04:51.457,But it’s a wedding for some friend of yours I never even heard of.
00:04:51.541,00:04:54.293,It’s non-negotiable. You can borrow a dress of Haley’s again.
00:04:54.377,00:04:58.506,No. That sends an ugly message– that I’m Haley.
00:04:58.590,00:05:03.970,"You know, instead of trying to force me to wear a dress, why don’t you worry about getting Luke to wear some pants?"
00:05:04.054,00:05:08.725,What? Why does he do this?
00:05:09.809,00:05:11.352,Luke!
00:05:11.436,00:05:13.396,Pants! Come on!
00:05:20.237,00:05:23.573,"but with kind of, um, an invisible asterisk."
00:05:23.657,00:05:26.909,"Um, he’s not, uh– He’s not a talker."
00:05:26.993,00:05:29.745,Or-Or a hugger.
00:05:29.829,00:05:32.582,Once he ran over my foot with his car.
00:05:32.666,00:05:37.420,"To-To be fair, he had just given up smoking, but basically we’re-we’re buds."
00:05:38.672,00:05:40.590,Do you have to just stand there?
00:05:40.674,00:05:42.925,You’re making me feel uneasy.
00:05:43.009,00:05:44.886,Oh.
00:05:46.763,00:05:48.681,"Oh, for God’s sake. Sit here. Here."
00:05:48.765,00:05:51.601,Hold this wing like this while I adjust this.
00:05:51.685,00:05:53.603,Okay.
00:05:53.687,00:05:55.939,Come on. Here.
00:06:05.073,00:06:07.284,Not too hard.
00:06:09.119,00:06:11.704,"Alex, why don’t you come shopping with me?"
00:06:11.788,00:06:14.832,Maybe I can help you find something that you like.
00:06:14.916,00:06:17.376,"That’s a really nice offer, but it’s not really her thing."
00:06:17.460,00:06:19.712,"Actually, I’d love to go."
00:06:19.796,00:06:21.547,"See, you don’t know what my thing is."
00:06:21.631,00:06:23.466,You have no idea what my thing is.
00:06:23.550,00:06:25.468,I know what your thing is.
00:06:28.096,00:06:33.184,"is to never come out of her room, and your brother’s thing– Well, there’s your brother’s thing."
00:06:33.268,00:06:37.563,Luke! Put ’em on! Mm-hmm.
00:06:40.317,00:06:44.737,"always been stuck in that, um– that primal place where it started."
00:06:44.821,00:06:51.744,"You know, he’s the old silverback protecting his females, then along comes this younger, stronger gorilla swinging in, beating his chest."
00:06:51.828,00:06:56.916,"You know, naturally, the ape ladies come running, presenting their nice scarlet behinds."
00:06:57.000,00:06:59.752,"Papa ape wants to stop all that, but he can’t."
00:06:59.836,00:07:03.298,You know? That’s-That’s life. I’m not the enemy.
00:07:04.466,00:07:06.509,The enemy is poachers.
00:07:11.139,00:07:13.266,That’ll do it. Don’t touch it.
00:07:18.396,00:07:20.106,All right.
00:07:24.486,00:07:26.863,You wanna go fly it?
00:07:29.658,00:07:33.286,"Oh. Hey, I got the toothpaste and the soap."
00:07:33.370,00:07:36.080,Good. Now we can open that general store.
00:07:36.164,00:07:37.957,I thought we were just here to get diapers.
00:07:38.041,00:07:43.421,"We had a saying on the farm: As long as you’re bringing the mule to the market, you– I feel you rolling your eyes at me."
00:07:43.505,00:07:46.257,We met at one of Pepper’s legendary game nights.
00:07:46.341,00:07:48.759,I remember Mitchell because he kept rolling his eyes...
00:07:48.843,00:07:51.262,every time I would get a little boisterous.
00:07:51.346,00:07:53.598,A little bit.
00:07:53.682,00:07:59.437,"Yeah, maybe a little bit. Anyway, we were– we were playing charades, and I had no idea how to act out my clue."
00:07:59.521,00:08:07.028,"And all I could think of to do was– And without missing a beat, Cam says– Casablanca."
00:08:07.112,00:08:09.197,All I did was this– Casablanca.
00:08:10.198,00:08:11.824,Casablanca.
00:08:11.908,00:08:14.035,Can we just please get the diapers and get out of here?
00:08:14.119,00:08:16.162,"Fine, but I wanna stop by the wine section first."
00:08:19.249,00:08:21.709,"Yeah, a really good one– just past the tires."
00:08:21.793,00:08:24.712,"They do not have– Oh, my God."
00:08:24.796,00:08:28.007,"Oh, my– Cam. Cam. The paper shredder I wanted."
00:08:28.091,00:08:29.717,Huh? Confetti and crosscut.
00:08:35.640,00:08:37.308,Yeah.
00:08:39.811,00:08:43.731,"Cam, what is this place?"
00:08:46.651,00:08:49.528,Those cookies smell like heaven. Your own recipe?
00:08:49.612,00:08:51.530,"No, I just throw ’em in the oven."
00:08:54.701,00:08:56.577,Sure.
00:08:56.661,00:08:58.579,"So, you and Luke having a good time?"
00:08:58.663,00:09:01.040,I don’t know. He won’t come out of his box.
00:09:01.124,00:09:05.127,Maybe I’ll just stay here and spend some time with my sister.
00:09:05.211,00:09:08.714,"Oh, right. I guess technically I would be your stepsister."
00:09:08.798,00:09:12.551,My mother says we are never to use the word step because it means not real.
00:09:12.635,00:09:14.804,And we are a real family.
00:09:16.139,00:09:18.141,"So what is the matter, Claire?"
00:09:19.392,00:09:22.312,- What? - You seem sad.
00:09:24.230,00:09:26.565,"It’s just stuff with Alex. You know, kid stuff."
00:09:28.401,00:09:31.488,You don’t have to tell me. My school is full of them.
00:09:33.823,00:09:36.951,I was thinking after lunch we can go and do a little shopping.
00:09:37.035,00:09:38.953,I’m not getting a dress.
00:09:39.037,00:09:40.996,I don’t care. I’m not your mother.
00:09:41.080,00:09:43.165,I know. You’re my grandmother.
00:09:43.249,00:09:45.418,Step-grandmother.
00:09:45.502,00:09:48.254,"Anyways, today, think of me as a girlfriend."
00:09:48.338,00:09:51.841,Two girls out for an afternoon of fun.
00:09:51.925,00:09:55.428,What do you usually do with your girlfriends?
00:09:55.512,00:09:59.098,"I don’t know. We go out. We talk, drink wine."
00:09:59.182,00:10:00.933,Can I drink wine?
00:10:01.017,00:10:02.852,Some friend.
00:10:02.936,00:10:06.272,"Well, you can still talk to me about anything."
00:10:06.356,00:10:08.941,"Yeah, adults always say that, but they don’t mean it."
00:10:09.025,00:10:12.445,"When my mom says I can ask her anything, I really can’t."
00:10:12.529,00:10:14.447,She just freaks out.
00:10:14.531,00:10:18.117,I won’t freak out. Shoot.
00:10:18.201,00:10:20.119,Okay.
00:10:20.203,00:10:21.954,How many men have you slept with?
00:10:22.038,00:10:24.624,Eight. Next.
00:10:29.796,00:10:32.006,Now can I try it?
00:10:33.424,00:10:36.469,I should get one of those. I’ve always loved planes.
00:10:36.553,00:10:40.723,"If things had gone a little differently in my life, I think I would have been a pilot."
00:10:40.807,00:10:44.310,"Hey, what would happen if you turned the remote off and then back on real fast?"
00:10:44.394,00:10:47.229,"Yeah, you’d have been a great pilot."
00:10:47.313,00:10:50.816,"So, can you do a– Can you do a loop-de-loop?"
00:10:50.900,00:10:52.985,No way! Can I try it?
00:10:53.069,00:10:54.988,No.
00:10:56.906,00:11:00.659,I can see why you like this. It’s so peaceful.
00:11:00.743,00:11:04.956,It’s like the whole world just... disappears out here.
00:11:07.667,00:11:09.585,I remember this one summer– I’ll tell you what.
00:11:09.669,00:11:11.337,There’s another trick called threading the needle.
00:11:11.421,00:11:13.798,I used to do it with Claire and Mitch when they were kids.
00:11:13.882,00:11:15.508,You wanna try it?
00:11:15.592,00:11:17.510,You grab one of those hoops over there...
00:11:17.594,00:11:21.347,"and go to the far, far, far end of the field..."
00:11:21.431,00:11:24.266,"and stand there, and I fly the plane through it."
00:11:24.350,00:11:27.102,"Um, that sounds awesome!"
00:11:27.186,00:11:29.104,And then I get a chance flying it?
00:11:42.160,00:11:43.869,How’s this?
00:11:43.953,00:11:45.871,Not far enough. Go on.
00:11:45.955,00:11:48.374,- Okay. Further down. - You can’t go too far.
00:11:48.458,00:11:50.960,"Right. Okay, I get it. I get it."
00:11:55.965,00:11:58.133,How’s this?
00:11:58.217,00:12:01.554,Now stand still. Don’t move.
00:12:01.638,00:12:05.099,"Okay, let’s do it. Whoo!"
00:12:05.183,00:12:07.768,Whoo! I love it!
00:12:21.491,00:12:23.576,You drove a plane into my face.
00:12:23.660,00:12:25.661,You must have moved. I told you to stay still.
00:12:25.745,00:12:27.663,I didn’t move.
00:12:27.747,00:12:30.916,I want to make sure nothing’s broken.
00:12:31.000,00:12:35.337,"Alex and I can’t just disagree. I mean, she has to turn everything into a fight."
00:12:35.421,00:12:37.590,"Hmm. A strong, independent woman."
00:12:37.674,00:12:40.217,Sounds like somebody else I know.
00:12:40.301,00:12:45.264,"I was never hostile though. I mean, this whole thing with the dress– Never had this problem with Haley."
00:12:45.348,00:12:48.434,Maybe Alex doesn’t want to compete with her big sister.
00:12:48.518,00:12:51.061,Maybe she’s trying to create her own identity.
00:12:51.145,00:12:53.439,"Put her in a dress, and she disappears."
00:12:53.523,00:12:57.193,For one afternoon?
00:12:58.194,00:12:59.695,Wow.
00:12:59.779,00:13:02.364,Sometimes it’s hard to remember you’re only 10 years old.
00:13:02.448,00:13:04.950,And three-quarters.
00:13:07.870,00:13:09.997,"Hey, it’s Mitchell. Do you guys eat olives? Olives?"
00:13:10.081,00:13:11.790,Really good olives?
00:13:13.584,00:13:16.003,"Mitchell, I found the diapers. They’re over here."
00:13:16.087,00:13:18.255,"Cameron, guess what I found?"
00:13:18.339,00:13:21.508,Coffins. They sell baby formula and they sell coffins.
00:13:21.592,00:13:23.969,You can buy literally buy everything you need from birth to death.
00:13:24.053,00:13:26.347,"Oh, my God. Look at these diapers."
00:13:28.433,00:13:31.644,"Oh. You know what we should do? We should get enough for the next year or two, right?"
00:13:31.728,00:13:33.771,Where would we keep them?
00:13:33.855,00:13:37.274,They sell sheds.
00:13:37.358,00:13:39.985,We’re those guys now? The guys with a diaper shed?
00:13:40.069,00:13:43.822,Just grab two more.
00:13:43.906,00:13:46.992,"Come on, come on. We need, uh– Hey, excuse me."
00:13:47.076,00:13:49.370,Where did you get that flatbed thing? Over there.
00:13:49.454,00:13:51.997,Go grab one of those.
00:13:52.081,00:13:54.167,Yeah. Get two.
00:13:56.961,00:13:58.879,I’m in the applesauce aisle.
00:13:58.963,00:14:01.215,"So, anyways, after charades, we went out for coffee."
00:14:01.299,00:14:06.679,And I learned that he loves art. He plays the piano. He speaks French.
00:14:06.763,00:14:09.974,Un peu.
00:14:10.058,00:14:12.059,"Yeah, I’m sort of like Costco."
00:14:12.143,00:14:14.895,"I’m big, I’m not fancy, and I dare you to not like me."
00:14:14.979,00:14:23.613,"Yeah, and I’m kinda more like that, um– You are such a snob."
00:14:26.449,00:14:28.451,Casablanca.
00:14:29.452,00:14:31.412,I have a small flower on my ankle...
00:14:31.496,00:14:35.874,and a tiny little butterfly on my... thigh.
00:14:35.958,00:14:37.251,How high up?
00:14:40.338,00:14:43.549,No– Did you do it for a guy? Does Grandpa like it?
00:14:43.633,00:14:45.926,"No, no and yes."
00:14:46.010,00:14:48.095,That’s gross.
00:14:48.179,00:14:50.597,Let’s go back to your piercings.
00:14:50.681,00:14:54.560,I’ve answered enough of your questions. Now it’s your turn to answer one.
00:14:54.644,00:14:56.311,What is it?
00:14:56.395,00:14:58.313,Why you don’t want to wear a dress?
00:14:58.397,00:15:01.650,Because I don’t want to look like Haley and her stupid friends.
00:15:01.734,00:15:04.236,I wear dresses and I don’t look like Haley.
00:15:04.320,00:15:07.656,"You are Haley, just 40 years older."
00:15:07.740,00:15:09.074,Ten.
00:15:09.158,00:15:12.786,"Deal. Alex, why are you fighting me on this?"
00:15:12.870,00:15:16.415,Just– It doesn’t matter if I dress up. I’m not pretty like Haley and you.
00:15:16.499,00:15:19.418,That’s ridiculous! You’re beautiful.
00:15:22.505,00:15:26.925,Mmm. The cute busboy doesn’t know that you’re smart.
00:15:27.009,00:15:30.262,He’s been smiling at you every time he comes to the table.
00:15:30.346,00:15:33.516,Why do you think we are the only people with bread?
00:15:35.017,00:15:39.480,Look. One day you’re going to want to date a cute guy like that.
00:15:39.564,00:15:44.944,"And when that day comes, you’re going to want to look beautiful, and then you’ll wear a dress."
00:15:47.280,00:15:49.281,"So, you ever kiss another girl?"
00:15:49.365,00:15:52.159,That’s no way to talk to your grandmother.
00:15:52.243,00:15:55.579,"Was my mom hard on me growing up? Yeah, she was."
00:15:55.663,00:16:00.459,But you know what? Back then everything was Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem.
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.548,"Hey, how’d it go?"
00:16:06.632,00:16:10.677,"- Did you have fun with Luke? - Well, not– We had a great time."
00:16:10.761,00:16:14.389,"Alex, I’ve been thinking, and..."
00:16:14.473,00:16:17.976,"if you don’t want to wear a dress to the wedding, it’s not the end of the world."
00:16:18.060,00:16:21.063,It’s all right. I bought one.
00:16:23.232,00:16:26.068,Do you see how she has to provoke me? We’ll talk about it next week.
00:16:28.404,00:16:30.322,Clear the way. Coming through.
00:16:30.406,00:16:32.074,"Coming through. Easy. Easy, fella."
00:16:32.158,00:16:34.243,I need to rest my face.
00:16:34.327,00:16:35.577,You’ll be all right. Hang on.
00:16:35.661,00:16:37.412,"Oh, my God!"
00:16:37.496,00:16:38.580,Ah! Dad?
00:16:38.664,00:16:40.082,Little accident. Nothing big.
00:16:40.166,00:16:42.417,I was in a plane crash.
00:16:42.501,00:16:44.628,"We were threading the needle, and somebody moved."
00:16:44.712,00:16:49.258,"- No, I didn’t. You did it on purpose. - That’s the painkiller talking."
00:16:49.342,00:16:51.009,He’s a little loopy.
00:16:51.093,00:16:52.803,How bad is it?
00:16:55.598,00:16:58.684,"I was in a plane crash. Thanks, Dad."
00:16:58.768,00:17:00.894,I didn’t ask him to be there. He insisted.
00:17:00.978,00:17:02.896,He took a chance. This is what happened.
00:17:02.980,00:17:05.691,- Kind of like the time you ran over his foot. - You ran over his foot?
00:17:05.775,00:17:07.860,That was an accident.
00:17:07.944,00:17:10.863,- We all saw the tire marks on the lawn. - I had just quit smoking.
00:17:10.947,00:17:13.073,"See, you’re upsetting your husband."
00:17:13.157,00:17:15.117,Water.
00:17:17.578,00:17:19.538,Ay. You okay?
00:17:19.622,00:17:22.708,Gloria! Thank God you’re here.
00:17:22.792,00:17:24.710,Don’t worry. I’m here too.
00:17:24.794,00:17:27.129,Who’s this?
00:17:27.213,00:17:29.131,Wasn’t my fault.
00:17:29.215,00:17:32.217,I have seen you thread the needle a million times. You never miss.
00:17:32.301,00:17:35.721,Yeah. I must be getting old.
00:17:35.805,00:17:37.764,Put that down. You do not get a cookie.
00:17:37.848,00:17:41.894,"I like Phil. It’s just that sometimes he tries too hard, you know?"
00:17:44.647,00:17:48.066,"Okay, maybe he tries too hard because you make zero effort with him."
00:17:48.150,00:17:53.906,"You know what? In the 16 years that we’ve been married, have you one time told him that you liked him?"
00:17:53.990,00:17:56.241,"Not in those exact words, no."
00:17:56.325,00:17:59.829,"Not in any words, Dad. How do you think that makes me feel?"
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.582,You’ve never told your son that you love him?
00:18:03.666,00:18:06.084,"Whoa, whoa. When did we jump to love?"
00:18:06.168,00:18:08.170,And he’s technically not my son.
00:18:08.254,00:18:11.590,Ah. So that means that you don’t love Manny either?
00:18:11.674,00:18:15.135,"I mean, believe me, when I was in that park, I really wished Manny was there."
00:18:15.219,00:18:20.265,For what? So that you could fly the plane into his head? Huh?
00:18:20.349,00:18:23.602,"Dad, thanks so much for bringing Phil home."
00:18:23.686,00:18:31.568,"I found one of your little flaps in his hair. So– Actually, this is called an aileron."
00:18:31.652,00:18:33.863,It controls the horizontal– Because that’s what matters right now.
00:18:34.864,00:18:36.782,"Bye, Dad."
00:18:45.833,00:18:49.462,"- Hey, Phil. - Jay."
00:18:52.340,00:18:54.049,"What are you, made of china?"
00:18:56.510,00:19:00.597,"Phil, I just want you to know I’m sorry."
00:19:00.681,00:19:06.186,"And whether I, uh, missed or you moved– I didn’t."
00:19:06.270,00:19:08.480,I just want to say that I like you.
00:19:08.564,00:19:11.149,Really?
00:19:11.233,00:19:13.235,What do you like about me?
00:19:16.447,00:19:18.657,You’re a nice guy.
00:19:18.741,00:19:21.702,Try real hard.
00:19:21.786,00:19:23.870,I do.
00:19:23.954,00:19:27.082,And you’re a good dad.
00:19:34.298,00:19:36.216,What’s going on?
00:19:36.300,00:19:40.095,"There was a little accident, but Jay’s telling Phil how much he loves him."
00:19:40.179,00:19:42.347,"Oh. Well, that’s nice for Phil."
00:19:42.431,00:19:44.558,"That’s great, since he’s never said anything like that to my boyfriend."
00:19:44.642,00:19:46.601,"- Let it go. - No, it’s not okay."
00:19:46.685,00:19:49.521,"No, Mitch is right. Go in there too, Cam. Come on."
00:19:49.605,00:19:51.106,You’re kidding.
00:19:51.190,00:19:52.858,- Jay! - I’m gonna get this.
00:19:52.942,00:19:54.568,"Come on in, Cam."
00:19:54.652,00:19:56.069,- Get in here. - Say it.
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.240,"I like you too, Cam."
00:20:00.324,00:20:02.367,What do you like about him?
00:20:02.451,00:20:03.994,Where did you get that camera?
00:20:04.078,00:20:06.705,Only the greatest store on earth.
00:20:09.375,00:20:10.917,"Manny, picture! Get in there too."
00:20:11.001,00:20:13.170,Oh!
00:20:13.254,00:20:15.297,Stay still. Say cheese.
00:20:15.381,00:20:16.923,Don’t push it.
00:20:17.007,00:20:18.091,Picture.
00:20:18.175,00:20:20.093,Cheese!
00:20:31.814,00:20:39.863,"I always wanted a daughter– to dress her up in pretty dresses, do her hair, her nails, her makeup."
00:20:42.032,00:20:48.914,"No one knows this, but for the first year of his life, I made up Manny like a girl and told everybody that he was my daughter."
00:20:51.000,00:20:52.918,"Ay, but just for a few times."
00:20:53.002,00:20:54.628,I didn’t want to mess with his head.
00:20:54.712,00:20:59.383,"When he found the pictures, I told him that it was his twin sister who died."
00:02:10.714,00:00:07.132,"Dec. 25 9:17am Jay &amp; Gloria’s Wedding Last February Jay, I’m home."
00:00:07.216,00:00:09.926,Did Manny call?
00:00:10.010,00:00:12.554,"It was a slumber party, not a gang fight."
00:00:12.638,00:00:15.265,I just want him to fit in.
00:00:17.976,00:00:20.854,"You know, honey, there’s a gun in the footlocker in the garage."
00:00:20.938,00:00:24.190,"If I ever say no to that question, I want you to use it on me."
00:00:27.694,00:00:30.196,"All dressed in black, black, black."
00:00:30.280,00:00:32.448,"With silver buttons, buttons, buttons."
00:00:32.532,00:00:34.951,"All down her back, back, back."
00:00:35.035,00:00:37.537,Why aren’t they trying to hurt each other?
00:00:37.621,00:00:39.831,"I don’t know, but I’m afraid to move."
00:00:39.915,00:00:43.001,Thanks.
00:00:47.673,00:00:49.591,"Now, that is a scone."
00:00:49.675,00:00:51.968,No butter. Nonfat.
00:00:52.052,00:00:54.220,Shut up.
00:00:54.304,00:00:56.306,I’m gonna go check on Lily.
00:01:00.769,00:01:03.563,Surprise!
00:01:05.732,00:01:09.569,What’s that?
00:01:09.653,00:01:12.071,"Oh, God. That’s a bad sign."
00:01:17.286,00:01:18.912,Ow!
00:01:18.996,00:01:21.789,What happened?
00:01:21.873,00:01:24.250,"Hi, honey. Mmm!"
00:01:21.873,00:01:26.669,"Hi. I, uh– I– I didn’t know you were in town. You didn’t call."
00:01:26.753,00:01:30.632,"Well, I couldn’t wait to see your new baby. Where is she?"
00:01:30.716,00:01:32.759,"Mitchell, who was that? It’s my mom."
00:01:32.843,00:01:37.388,"Oh, yeah, right, ’cause the last time she was here, the refrigerator magnets rearranged themselves..."
00:01:37.472,00:01:40.517,into a penta– Grandma!
00:01:54.573,00:01:56.157,Oh.
00:01:56.241,00:01:58.159,"Mom. Mom, what are you doing to her legs?"
00:01:58.243,00:02:00.662,Tai chi. I did it every day in Sedona.
00:02:00.746,00:02:02.455,"Cameron, you should try it."
00:02:04.916,00:02:08.628,Mitchell’s mother has a problem... with me.
00:02:08.712,00:02:14.300,"Last Christmas, for example, she gave me a piece of exercise equipment and a lettuce dryer."
00:02:10.714,00:02:21.349,"Dec. 25 9:17am So, to recap, I gave her a gorgeous pair of diamond earrings, and she gave me a hint."
00:02:21.433,00:02:25.478,And living in Sedona has been transformational.
00:02:25.562,00:02:28.982,"I get up every morning, and I go to a Vortex meditation site..."
00:02:29.066,00:02:34.362,and work with a shaman to finally understand how to live my spirituality.
00:02:34.446,00:02:35.989,Yikes.
00:02:36.073,00:02:39.742,And I’ve learned that the only way I can move...
00:02:39.826,00:02:42.495,to the next level of my awakening...
00:02:42.579,00:02:45.498,is if we all can somehow...
00:02:45.582,00:02:48.418,get past... the incident.
00:02:48.502,00:02:50.128,"Oh, no."
00:02:50.212,00:02:53.881,"- The incident. - Oh, boy."
00:02:53.965,00:02:57.427,I would like to congratulate Jay and the lovely Gloria.
00:02:53.965,00:02:59.762,Jay &amp; Gloria’s wedding Last February I’m very happy for them.
00:02:59.846,00:03:02.265,"I wanted a big, beautiful wedding with Jay..."
00:03:02.349,00:03:04.350,because my ex-husband and I got married...
00:03:04.434,00:03:07.603,in a tiny little office of a judge in Colombia.
00:03:07.687,00:03:15.070,"My mother wanted to go to the wedding to show everyone how okay she was with all of it, so I convinced Dad and Gloria to invite her."
00:03:16.321,00:03:18.823,Who warned you that that was the worst idea ever?
00:03:18.907,00:03:21.284,Anyone? Anyone?
00:03:25.455,00:03:33.171,"I was supposed to come with a date, but he just hurt his back, which is very ironic because he’s young and-and healthy."
00:03:33.255,00:03:35.006,My mom started drinking...
00:03:35.090,00:03:37.592,these cocktails called Horny Colombians...
00:03:37.676,00:03:43.598,"with some of Gloria’s uncles, whom apparently the drink was named after."
00:03:46.560,00:03:48.770,They kept patting my butt.
00:03:48.854,00:03:51.522,Somebody’s full of herself.
00:03:51.606,00:03:54.317,"It’s a– It’s a Colombian wedding tradition, they said."
00:03:56.820,00:03:58.988,I would like to make a toast.
00:03:59.072,00:04:01.407,Yeah. Nana got totally wasted.
00:04:01.491,00:04:03.910,"Uh, it was really funny."
00:04:03.994,00:04:06.412,Then it was gross.
00:04:06.496,00:04:09.749,To the bride and the groom– my ex.
00:04:09.833,00:04:15.088,"Thirty-five years we were together, and he couldn’t wait 10 minutes to run off with Charo."
00:04:22.971,00:04:25.264,when I saw his wallet and her boobs.
00:04:26.933,00:04:28.810,Take your hands off me!
00:04:28.894,00:04:31.979,"- Mom. Mom. - Oh, relax, Mitchell."
00:04:32.063,00:04:33.981,"What, did you take your Claire pill?"
00:04:34.065,00:04:36.275,"Let’s just go get a little fresh air, okay?"
00:04:36.359,00:04:38.444,And then it got weird.
00:04:43.200,00:04:46.119,No!
00:04:48.580,00:04:52.708,Ayayayayay! Ooh! Ayayayayay!
00:04:55.045,00:04:59.090,"During my vows to my first husband, drug dealers burst in and assassinated the judge."
00:04:59.174,00:05:02.301,This was way worse.
00:05:04.387,00:05:06.305,"It’s too soon, I guess."
00:05:06.389,00:05:10.643,"- Everybody is going to be there, Mom! - I don’t care."
00:05:10.727,00:05:14.647,Your father and I are not about to let you drive two hours to go to a concert...
00:05:14.731,00:05:18.526,"and then spend the night with a bunch of boys, especially that 17-year-old hormone you’re dating."
00:05:18.610,00:05:21.487,"- It’s totally supervised. - Oh, really? By whom?"
00:05:21.571,00:05:24.240,- By Spencer Patine’s uncle. - Who’s Spencer Patine?
00:05:24.324,00:05:26.325,You know Spencer– the guy with the arm.
00:05:26.409,00:05:29.662,Wait. What kind of arm? What does that even mean?
00:05:29.746,00:05:32.665,"Oh, Uncle Toby. I’ll be sure to include that in my Amber Alert."
00:05:32.749,00:05:36.085,"Oh, my God!"
00:05:36.169,00:05:38.087,"Haley, what your mom is worried about..."
00:05:38.171,00:05:41.507,is you getting your heart broken when Dylan goes off to college next year.
00:05:41.591,00:05:44.552,He’s not going to college.
00:05:44.636,00:05:47.013,"He’s in a band, okay? They’re going on tour."
00:05:47.097,00:05:49.098,"Oh, this just gets better and better."
00:05:49.182,00:05:51.976,Why are you always on me about everything?
00:05:52.060,00:05:54.353,"Because you need to understand– Okay. Everybody, calm down!"
00:05:54.437,00:05:56.355,Let’s start from the beginning.
00:05:56.439,00:05:59.109,What’s wrong with Spencer’s arm?
00:06:03.613,00:06:05.615,"Mom, I’m home!"
00:06:05.699,00:06:08.868,"Ay, baby! Did you have fun at the slumber party?"
00:06:08.952,00:06:11.913,You must be exhausted.
00:06:11.997,00:06:14.707,I was the first one to fall asleep.
00:06:14.791,00:06:18.878,What’s on your face? A smile from having such a good time with my friends.
00:06:18.962,00:06:21.590,No. Come here.
00:06:24.175,00:06:26.719,Look.
00:06:26.803,00:06:28.763,That’s why they were laughing.
00:06:28.847,00:06:31.724,I thought it was my funny take on current events.
00:06:31.808,00:06:34.685,Why would they do something like that?
00:06:34.769,00:06:38.356,Guys pull pranks like that all the time. You just gotta prank ’em back.
00:06:38.440,00:06:41.693,You just gotta show ’em you’re willing to give as good as you get.
00:06:42.902,00:06:46.364,What do you think?
00:06:46.448,00:06:48.574,Revenge.
00:06:48.658,00:06:50.619,I like it.
00:06:53.663,00:07:00.336,"Well, Mom, instead of dredging up the whole incident, maybe we should just try and repress it, like a– like a normal family."
00:07:00.420,00:07:03.256,I can’t. I need closure.
00:07:03.340,00:07:06.342,I’m about to embark on a new journey.
00:07:06.426,00:07:08.719,- I met a man. - Really?
00:07:13.892,00:07:16.102,- Wow. Where? - Canada.
00:07:16.186,00:07:19.188,- You’re moving to-to Canada? - French Canada.
00:07:19.272,00:07:22.650,Oh.
00:07:22.734,00:07:26.779,It is wonderful. It’s just that when I think of all the awful things...
00:07:26.863,00:07:32.660,"that I said to Gloria and Jay and you and Claire, I feel such guilt."
00:07:32.744,00:07:34.870,"Give it time, and see Banff."
00:07:34.954,00:07:36.872,"Cam, please."
00:07:36.956,00:07:40.960,I just can’t give myself to him sexually.
00:07:41.044,00:07:42.962,Okay. Mom.
00:07:43.046,00:07:48.509,"Oh, oh. Don’t get me wrong. We satisfy each other down there– Oh!"
00:07:46.591,00:07:52.638,"Can’t– Don’t wanna– That’s why I need everyone’s forgiveness. I need your help, Mitchell."
00:07:52.722,00:07:56.475,"Did you hear that, Mitchell? Your mom needs your help to make love to her new man, Chas."
00:08:02.774,00:08:06.068,"Well, everyone’s mad at me."
00:08:02.774,00:08:09.072,Oh– Maybe you could pave the way so that I can apologize.
00:08:10.115,00:08:17.872,"Well, um, you know, we are actually all supposed to have Sunday dinner tonight, so maybe I could go around and ask everyone if it’s okay for you to join us."
00:08:17.956,00:08:21.250,Oh! I knew I could count on you.
00:08:21.334,00:08:23.210,"Oh, my beautiful boy."
00:08:23.294,00:08:25.004,I love you so much.
00:08:25.088,00:08:29.175,There’s a fish in nature that swims around with its babies in its mouth.
00:08:29.259,00:08:31.719,That fish would look at Mitchell’s relationship with his mother...
00:08:31.803,00:08:33.763,"and say, That’s messed up."
00:08:38.601,00:08:40.520,Hey.
00:08:44.357,00:08:47.860,"things with your mom got pretty intense down there, huh?"
00:08:47.944,00:08:51.030,All like East Coast-West Coast. You feelin’ me?
00:08:51.114,00:08:53.491,"Act like a parent, talk like a peer."
00:08:53.575,00:08:55.534,I call it peerenting.
00:08:55.618,00:08:58.454,"I learned it from my own dad, who used to walk into my room..."
00:09:01.124,00:09:04.627,"Honey, I would love to let you go to the concert."
00:09:04.711,00:09:07.213,Are you kidding me? I think concerts are rad.
00:09:07.297,00:09:09.799,- Hello? I was a Hall-Raiser. - A what?
00:09:09.883,00:09:12.385,I followed Hall &amp; Oates around the country one summer.
00:09:12.469,00:09:14.720,Rich Girl just spoke to me.
00:09:14.804,00:09:17.515,I was dating this girl. Not– Not dating.
00:09:17.599,00:09:22.812,"I guess I was following her too, kind of– Okay, Mom just doesn’t trust me, and it’s not fair."
00:09:22.896,00:09:26.190,She trusts you. It’s just that weird stuff happens at concerts.
00:09:26.274,00:09:28.526,- Boys get urges. - Ew.
00:09:28.610,00:09:30.569,"Dad, is there something you want?"
00:09:30.653,00:09:33.155,"Yes, there is– to connect with this girl right here."
00:09:33.239,00:09:35.157,"Now, come on. Pretend I’m not your dad."
00:09:35.241,00:09:37.576,We’re just a couple of friends kickin’ it in a juice bar.
00:09:37.660,00:09:40.454,"- What’s a juice bar? - Okay, a malt shop. Whatever."
00:09:40.538,00:09:42.289,"Dad, I don’t– No. Who’s Dad?"
00:09:42.373,00:09:45.584,Who’s Dad? I’m– I’m Marcus from Biology.
00:09:48.338,00:09:52.258,Has he tried anything inappropriate with you? Girl.
00:09:54.552,00:09:56.470,Nothing.
00:09:56.554,00:10:00.099,Just talking to some dork I met in a malt shop.
00:10:02.602,00:10:06.021,"Hey, Mitchell. What’s up?"
00:10:06.105,00:10:09.984,Do you– Do you remember how Mom gave up a career to raise us?
00:10:10.068,00:10:11.986,Promising career.
00:10:12.070,00:10:14.155,"Oh, God."
00:10:14.239,00:10:15.865,Mom.
00:10:15.949,00:10:18.284,Why so long?
00:10:18.368,00:10:21.704,"I know, I know. It’s weird when we haven’t talked for a while."
00:10:21.788,00:10:24.290,I mean your hair.
00:10:24.374,00:10:26.792,"Well, if I can’t tell you, who will?"
00:10:26.876,00:10:34.008,"So, Mom wants you to know that she’s very sorry about the incident, and-and she wants us to forgive her."
00:10:34.092,00:10:37.303,How very nice of her to say that through you.
00:10:37.387,00:10:42.558,"Do you see? The sarcasm is so hurtful, like a whip."
00:10:42.642,00:10:45.436,"You know how growing up, we all have that voice inside our head..."
00:10:45.520,00:10:48.397,that tells us we’re not good enough?
00:10:48.481,00:10:51.108,"Well, mine was outside my head, driving me to school."
00:10:51.192,00:10:55.529,"Uh, so– so anyway, Mom really wants to smooth everything over with Dad and Gloria."
00:10:55.613,00:11:00.576,"So I was thinking, uh, would it be okay if she maybe joined us for dinner tonight?"
00:11:00.660,00:11:03.204,Because it may be the last time you ever see me.
00:11:03.288,00:11:06.582,"Well– Okay. Wait, Mom. What are you talking about?"
00:11:06.666,00:11:09.543,"Well, I’m– I’m moving..."
00:11:09.627,00:11:12.421,to a far and dangerous place.
00:11:12.505,00:11:15.591,"Canada. But, uh, she met a man named Chas."
00:11:15.675,00:11:17.593,Yeah.
00:11:17.677,00:11:20.095,"Uh, like a lumberjack?"
00:11:20.179,00:11:23.349,"No, he logs blood samples into a cholesterol study."
00:11:23.433,00:11:28.437,"Anyway, until I’m past this whole wedding debacle, I can’t be intimate with him."
00:11:28.521,00:11:31.023,Oh.
00:11:31.107,00:11:33.609,We use our hands.
00:11:33.693,00:11:36.904,"Hey, Nana."
00:11:36.988,00:11:39.698,Hi.
00:11:39.782,00:11:43.536,Hmm. Tell Mom that. She won’t even let me go to a concert.
00:11:43.620,00:11:46.998,"Overnight, with her boyfriend."
00:11:48.124,00:11:50.084,What are you laughing at?
00:11:50.168,00:11:54.713,"Oh, karma’s a funny thing, that’s all."
00:11:54.797,00:11:56.966,"- Remember Ricky? - Oh, God."
00:11:57.050,00:11:59.426,Ooh. Who’s Ricky?
00:11:59.510,00:12:03.764,"Ricky was your mother’s boyfriend, and he looked like Charles Manson."
00:12:03.848,00:12:07.268,"And one night, she didn’t come home until 4:00 in the morning."
00:12:07.352,00:12:11.480,"4:00. Wow. Wow. Mom, what were you and Ricky doing?"
00:12:11.564,00:12:17.278,"Nothing. We were doing nothing, and he was a very sweet boy, which you might have known if you bothered to get to know him."
00:12:19.781,00:12:23.242,Dylan. Dylan isn’t Ricky. Ricky– Ricky was a poet.
00:12:23.326,00:12:26.412,Dylan writes songs. Awesome songs.
00:12:26.496,00:12:29.373,And maybe you would know that if you bothered to get to know him.
00:12:32.835,00:12:35.588,"Okay, you know? First of all, I am not my mother."
00:12:35.672,00:12:39.592,I don’t judge people before I get a chance to know them.
00:12:39.676,00:12:53.814,"So you invite Dylan over to dinner tonight, and if he’s as sweet and as kind as you say he is, then I have no problem considering letting you go to the concert, after I do a background check on Uncle Toby."
00:12:53.898,00:12:55.941,"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mom."
00:12:56.025,00:12:58.027,I’m gonna go call him!
00:13:00.446,00:13:03.782,That’s very revealing.
00:13:03.866,00:13:06.869,"- No, I meant your blouse. - Mom!"
00:13:06.953,00:13:10.039,"Claire, wait. Come– Not making this easy."
00:13:11.249,00:13:13.250,"Claire, come on. Stop, stop, stop."
00:13:13.334,00:13:19.465,"Just let her come to dinner, apologize to Dad and Gloria, and she and Chas can live happily ever after."
00:13:19.549,00:13:21.842,In Canada.
00:13:21.926,00:13:25.804,"Wait. Why don’t you make her fix this, instead of you doing it as usual?"
00:13:25.888,00:13:27.806,Whoa. What’s that supposed to mean?
00:13:27.890,00:13:30.184,"Mom makes a mess, and there’s Mitchell to clean it up."
00:13:30.268,00:13:32.186,That is so not true.
00:13:32.270,00:13:37.441,"If anything, you’re the one with the screwed-up relationship with Mommy– With Mom."
00:13:37.525,00:13:40.986,"No, I didn’t say it– Damn it."
00:13:41.070,00:13:43.656,"She can come, but she’s gotta clear it with Daddy."
00:13:43.740,00:13:45.867,I did not say Daddy.
00:13:51.456,00:13:53.791,"Hey, Dad."
00:13:53.875,00:13:57.127,"Uh, I’m sorry to bother you. Can I talk to you and Gloria for a second?"
00:13:57.211,00:13:59.171,She’s out dealing with a Manny situation.
00:13:59.255,00:14:02.216,- He set a kid’s bike on fire. - Why?
00:14:02.300,00:14:08.097,"Oh, I might have told him to get even with some kids, and he went all Rambo with it."
00:14:08.181,00:14:09.932,Not my best parenting moment.
00:14:10.016,00:14:12.893,What’s up?
00:14:12.977,00:14:16.355,"Uh, well, you know, uh, Mom’s in town."
00:14:16.439,00:14:19.024,"No, your mom. She’s back from the grave. Yes. Yes, my mom, Dad."
00:14:19.108,00:14:21.360,My mom would be less scary.
00:14:21.444,00:14:26.198,"Listen, she’s a wreck about what happened at the wedding, and she wants to come to dinner tonight to apologize to everyone."
00:14:26.282,00:14:28.283,"Still her little errand boy, I see."
00:14:28.367,00:14:30.911,No– Why does everybody keep saying– No.
00:14:30.995,00:14:35.040,I– I’m just trying to piece this family back together.
00:14:37.335,00:14:39.420,"Oh, Gloria would never go for that in a million years."
00:14:39.504,00:14:42.715,"She’s still furious with your mother, which is why I’m not talking to you."
00:14:42.799,00:14:45.467,What did I do?
00:14:45.551,00:14:48.053,That’s not very nice. I drove all the way here.
00:14:48.137,00:14:54.143,"- You never even called. - I would’ve called, but I thought it would be better– What’s happening here?"
00:14:54.227,00:15:01.400,"Listen, I would love to get this thing behind us, but Gloria would never forgive me if I pulled a fast one on her."
00:15:01.484,00:15:06.822,"That’s why you’re going to pull a fast one on her, and I’m not going to like it one bit."
00:15:06.906,00:15:09.324,"Okay, that’s just great. No, that’s great. So, it’s all up to me."
00:15:09.408,00:15:12.327,"I can’t hear you because you’re back home, and I’m taking a nap."
00:15:18.876,00:15:20.627,D-Money! There he is.
00:15:20.711,00:15:22.379,Come on in.
00:15:22.463,00:15:24.089,Hi. How you doing?
00:15:24.173,00:15:26.508,"Good. Um– Uh, hey, everybody."
00:15:26.592,00:15:28.761,This is Dylan.
00:15:28.845,00:15:30.846,"Hi, Dylan."
00:15:30.930,00:15:34.308,He has a very gentle soul.
00:15:34.392,00:15:36.602,You got that from Hey?
00:15:36.686,00:15:38.687,"So, Dylan, see you brought the ax."
00:15:38.771,00:15:41.106,"Yeah, yeah. I just came from practice."
00:15:41.190,00:15:43.442,"- Miss those days. - Oh, you were in a band?"
00:15:43.526,00:15:49.615,"Could have been, but in high school I was really all about my magic, so– Oh, my God. Over."
00:15:49.699,00:15:52.701,"- Oh, that’s gonna be Dad and Gloria. - Oh, Mitchell."
00:15:52.785,00:15:56.121,"I know it’s silly, but I’m a little nervous."
00:15:56.205,00:15:59.124,Oh. That’s not silly. You should be.
00:15:59.208,00:16:01.960,Hola.
00:16:02.044,00:16:03.754,Manny?
00:16:03.838,00:16:05.464,Nice mustache.
00:16:05.548,00:16:07.675,Don’t make fun. He may burn your house down.
00:16:10.595,00:16:13.305,"- Oh, boy. - Dede."
00:16:13.389,00:16:16.308,"- Hi, Jay, Gloria. - What is she doing here?"
00:16:16.392,00:16:18.560,"What does she mean, What is she doing here?"
00:16:18.644,00:16:21.355,- Mitchell told you I’d be here. - Lies!
00:16:21.439,00:16:23.524,"I couldn’t tell her, because she wouldn’t come."
00:16:23.608,00:16:25.818,"Gloria, uh, my mom wants to apologize for everything."
00:16:25.902,00:16:29.363,"So you just spring it on Gloria like this? Mitchell, what the hell is wrong with you?"
00:16:29.447,00:16:32.116,"- I don’t want her apologies. - Who could blame you, honey?"
00:16:34.327,00:16:36.453,Jay. Manny. Let’s go.
00:16:38.664,00:16:43.669,I– I just want to tell you how sorry I am for ruining your wedding.
00:16:43.753,00:16:47.756,I was struggling with being alone.
00:16:47.840,00:16:57.266,"Meanwhile, Jay moves on so easily, and-and not with just anyone– with a... young..."
00:16:57.350,00:16:59.518,and smart and beautiful woman.
00:16:59.602,00:17:01.895,I don’t expect you to forgive me.
00:17:01.979,00:17:06.442,"If I were you, I’d want to punch me right in the mouth."
00:17:14.492,00:17:17.494,I think we’ve had enough revenge in this family for one day.
00:17:17.578,00:17:20.497,Ah. Okay. Y– You see?
00:17:20.581,00:17:28.255,"Yeah, we’re all gonna move past this, and because of me, who’s not a mama’s boy, but is a caring person with wisdom and emotional insight."
00:17:28.339,00:17:31.300,"So make a note, bitches."
00:17:32.551,00:17:34.595,I forgive you.
00:17:35.596,00:17:38.056,"Oh, wow."
00:17:38.140,00:17:40.475,I am not prepared for this.
00:17:40.559,00:17:45.063,I just– I– I wanna rip your head off!
00:17:48.401,00:17:50.736,You ruined my wedding!
00:17:50.820,00:17:52.738,Oh!
00:17:52.822,00:17:55.199,"- I got Gloria! - Mom, come on."
00:17:58.202,00:18:00.579,I got Gloria.
00:18:00.663,00:18:02.789,Stand up like a big girl. Come on.
00:18:02.873,00:18:06.335,"All right. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it, the two of you."
00:18:06.419,00:18:08.795,I am so sorry about this.
00:18:08.879,00:18:12.758,"This is ridiculous. Gloria didn’t steal me, Dede, and you know it."
00:18:12.842,00:18:16.929,"We grew apart for years, and you left to find yourself, remember?"
00:18:17.013,00:18:19.514,I thought I could handle this.
00:18:19.598,00:18:22.226,- I’m so sorry. - You don’t say sorry anymore!
00:18:22.310,00:18:25.479,That word means nothing in your mouth!
00:18:27.356,00:18:28.982,I don’t know what just happened.
00:18:32.737,00:18:36.240,"I mean, it seems pretty simple to me."
00:18:36.324,00:18:38.867,"You’re reaching out, trying to hold on to something awesome."
00:18:38.951,00:18:44.998,"Um, maybe– maybe you shouldn’t– Look, look, look. I’m not used to this– the whole big family thing."
00:18:45.082,00:18:49.253,"In my house, we don’t even talk to each other."
00:18:49.337,00:18:53.173,"You know, it’s funny– the first time I saw Haley, I knew I liked her."
00:18:53.257,00:18:56.301,"I mean, she’s beautiful and everything, but it’s-it’s not just that."
00:18:56.385,00:19:04.893,"It’s that she’s got this killer confidence– you know, the kind of confidence that you get from having a family like this..."
00:19:04.977,00:19:06.895,that’s passionate...
00:19:06.979,00:19:10.148,and accepting of hot foreigners...
00:19:10.232,00:19:14.236,and gay dudes and nutty people.
00:19:14.320,00:19:20.993,"You know, a family that actually loves each other."
00:19:21.077,00:19:25.372,"I can’t believe I’m gonna say this, but maybe we should let her go with him."
00:19:25.456,00:19:28.000,He’s perfect.
00:19:28.084,00:19:35.215,"Everybody, Haley says that Dylan is a musician, and he writes some great songs."
00:19:35.299,00:19:37.301,Yeah.
00:19:37.385,00:19:39.344,"Well, I guess so, if you want me to."
00:19:41.680,00:19:44.516,"This is, uh, actually a song I wrote for Haley."
00:19:44.600,00:19:46.518,It’s called In the Moonlight.
00:19:46.602,00:19:48.938,"Lovely title, Dylan. Thanks."
00:20:42.700,00:20:46.787,She’s so not going.
00:21:27.870,00:21:30.372,Never good at harmonizing.
00:00:03.462,00:00:05.505,"Let’s go, buddy. Schooltime."
00:00:05.589,00:00:11.177,"Oh, and Gloria, if you want to get together with the girls later, I could just, you know, watch the football game or something."
00:00:11.261,00:00:13.179,That means he wants to watch a football game.
00:00:13.263,00:00:15.765,I’m not talking to you.
00:00:15.849,00:00:17.767,What are you drinking coffee for anyway?
00:00:17.851,00:00:19.769,It’s my culture. I’m Colombian.
00:00:19.853,00:00:23.731,"Oh, yeah? What part of Colombia are those French toaster sticks from?"
00:00:23.815,00:00:27.485,"Babe, I’m not sure about the game. The whole family’s coming over for the barbecue."
00:00:27.569,00:00:29.654,That’s today?
00:00:29.738,00:00:32.740,It’s the Ohio State game. So? Everybody can watch.
00:00:32.824,00:00:34.492,I don’t like watching the game...
00:00:34.576,00:00:36.202,with people who don’t know the game.
00:00:36.286,00:00:38.246,People talk.
00:00:38.330,00:00:39.998,"For one thing, it’s called soccer."
00:00:40.082,00:00:41.791,Your team scored two goals all season.
00:00:41.875,00:00:43.794,I’m not taking a big risk.
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.046,How much of this did you drink?
00:00:47.130,00:00:50.467,Give me a break. I have to climb a rope today.
00:00:53.470,00:00:56.222,Can I have $40 for lunch?
00:00:56.306,00:00:57.974,Forty dollars?
00:00:58.058,00:01:00.935,- I also need a book for school. - What book?
00:01:03.021,00:01:05.940,Do you have any idea what a bad liar you are?
00:01:06.024,00:01:09.736,I’d be more worried that she couldn’t come up with a single book title.
00:01:15.158,00:01:18.745,At least it isn’t zipped into his– Oh. There it is.
00:01:18.829,00:01:21.998,"Well, there’s book smart, and then there’s street smart."
00:01:22.082,00:01:24.000,"Yeah, and then there’s Luke."
00:01:24.084,00:01:26.419,"Oh, he’s just– He’s just curious. That’s all."
00:01:26.503,00:01:29.923,He’s got this almost scientific mind...
00:01:30.007,00:01:33.259,with a thirst for knowledge.
00:01:33.343,00:01:35.762,He’s like this little Einstein.
00:01:35.846,00:01:38.598,"Some people ask, Why?"
00:01:42.728,00:01:44.688,I ask Why? a lot.
00:01:46.231,00:01:49.484,We’re at the 10. We’re at the five.
00:01:49.568,00:01:52.070,"We’re at the one. Daddy, we’re scoring a touchdown!"
00:01:52.154,00:01:54.781,"No, please– please don’t spike our baby."
00:01:54.865,00:01:56.824,Why is she dressed like the Hamburglar?
00:01:56.908,00:02:00.787,She’s a referee. Oh. Do– Do we even have to go to my dad’s tonight?
00:02:00.871,00:02:03.623,Are you kidding me? We’re playing Ohio State.
00:02:03.707,00:02:05.708,I collect antique fountain pens.
00:02:05.792,00:02:12.548,I’m quite adept at Japanese flower arrangement– ikebana– and I was a starting offensive lineman at the University of Illinois.
00:02:12.632,00:02:14.342,Surprise.
00:02:14.426,00:02:16.344,I don’t like football.
00:02:18.430,00:02:20.431,was pretending to enjoy your partner’s interests.
00:02:20.515,00:02:23.059,Do you think I really loved home pickle-making?
00:02:23.143,00:02:24.978,"Yeah, ’cause you did."
00:02:25.062,00:02:27.605,"For a week, until we became the weird guys who gave everybody pickles."
00:02:27.689,00:02:30.650,"Oh, thank you, Marvin, for inviting us into your lovely home."
00:02:30.734,00:02:32.485,Here. Would you care for a sack of pickles?
00:02:32.569,00:02:35.238,"- It was charming. - We were picklers, Mitchell."
00:02:35.322,00:02:38.658,"Okay, you know what? Fine. Stay home with your little jagged scissors."
00:02:38.742,00:02:42.370,- Maybe catch up on your scrapbooking. - Come– You loved scrapbooking.
00:02:42.454,00:02:44.580,"Did I, Mitchell? Did I?"
00:02:44.664,00:02:46.916,Stop. Don’t do the double question to prove a point thing.
00:02:48.502,00:02:50.503,"Do you, Mitchell? Do you?"
00:02:50.587,00:02:52.589,"Stop, Lily."
00:03:06.937,00:03:09.272,No problem. We’ll be right down. Thanks.
00:03:17.239,00:03:20.199,The school just called. Luke got in a fight.
00:03:20.283,00:03:22.035,"Oh, geez. Is he okay?"
00:03:22.119,00:03:25.038,"Yeah, he’s fine, but they want us to come down there."
00:03:25.122,00:03:26.873,Where are you?
00:03:26.957,00:03:29.126,What house?
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.545,I’m golfing.
00:03:36.842,00:03:39.052,I bet it was that Durkas kid.
00:03:39.136,00:03:41.721,He probably jumped on Luke and Luke just fought back.
00:03:41.805,00:03:44.349,Kid’s a menace.
00:03:44.433,00:03:46.142,Shh. The parents are probably in there.
00:03:46.226,00:03:49.688,I slept on it funny. Like that never happened to him?
00:03:51.982,00:03:54.901,- What are you doing here? - These two knuckleheads were fighting each other.
00:03:57.320,00:03:59.822,I was not ready to face Durkas today.
00:03:59.906,00:04:01.824,So what happened?
00:04:01.908,00:04:05.244,"Well, apparently there was some name-calling and shoving on the playground."
00:04:05.328,00:04:09.415,"By the time a teacher separated them, Luke was sitting on Manny’s chest."
00:04:09.499,00:04:11.667,"- Luke, that’s not like you. - Wait a minute."
00:04:11.751,00:04:13.461,- You’re Luke’s father? - Grandfather.
00:04:13.545,00:04:16.881,- So Manny’s father is– - Javier.
00:04:16.965,00:04:19.967,Crazy guy. That’s where he gets his fire.
00:04:20.051,00:04:21.969,"- Okay, you’re– - He’s our son."
00:04:22.053,00:04:24.305,- And my grandson. - I’m his daughter.
00:04:24.389,00:04:26.224,- So you’re– - His uncle.
00:04:26.308,00:04:28.935,Stop saying that or I’ll sit on your chest again.
00:04:29.019,00:04:31.354,Ho! Wait a second. Is that what this was all about?
00:04:31.438,00:04:33.898,He keeps calling me his nephew.
00:04:33.982,00:04:35.900,Shut up!
00:04:35.984,00:04:39.112,"I’m getting the sense that you’re all related, uh, somehow."
00:04:39.196,00:04:41.447,So it’s probably best if you work this out at home...
00:04:41.531,00:04:43.199,"so the boys can go back to class, okay?"
00:04:43.283,00:04:45.493,"But we’re not happy about this, boys."
00:04:45.577,00:04:48.287,This is not how mature young men behave.
00:04:48.371,00:04:50.123,Here’s your note for Miss Passwater.
00:04:55.212,00:04:57.463,"Look, I wouldn’t worry. They’re good kids."
00:04:57.547,00:04:59.298,It’s just tough when one kid’s a little different.
00:04:59.382,00:05:01.384,Yes.
00:05:02.719,00:05:04.846,"You heard how she said that, right?"
00:05:08.892,00:05:13.271,"Her kid gets his head stuck in the furniture, and Manny is the different one."
00:05:13.355,00:05:15.273,I will tell you what’s weird. Our son is not weird.
00:05:15.357,00:05:18.151,What’s weird is that her kid wears aftershave and dresses like a count.
00:05:18.235,00:05:20.486,I think we should cancel with them for the barbecue.
00:05:20.570,00:05:23.489,"If we cancel, it’ll just make this a bigger deal than it is."
00:05:23.573,00:05:27.368,It’ll be good for Luke and Manny to spend some time.
00:05:27.452,00:05:29.912,Might be good for you and Gloria too.
00:05:29.996,00:05:32.832,She’s always had a problem with me.
00:05:32.916,00:05:34.834,I think I’m gonna find out what it is.
00:05:34.918,00:05:38.337,That’s the worst thing you could do. Just sweep it under the rug.
00:05:38.421,00:05:40.423,I’m not a sweeper.
00:05:40.507,00:05:42.425,I think you two need to talk it out.
00:05:42.509,00:05:44.343,I don’t have anything to say to her.
00:05:44.427,00:05:46.220,"She’s the one with the problem, not me."
00:05:46.304,00:05:50.099,Whose side are you on?
00:05:50.183,00:05:52.435,Let’s remember what’s important here.
00:05:52.519,00:05:54.437,There’s a football game on.
00:05:54.521,00:05:58.107,I just hate it when my two girls aren’t getting along.
00:05:58.191,00:06:00.610,How exactly is she your girl?
00:06:07.701,00:06:09.619,Is Lily ready to go?
00:06:11.788,00:06:13.706,What’s wrong?
00:06:16.626,00:06:19.545,"With the bad ankle, I don’t know how he’s gonna run his corner routes."
00:06:19.629,00:06:21.964,What did my boyfriend just say?
00:06:22.048,00:06:27.887,"Listen, I heard what you said, and I thought, yes, I should try to learn more about football."
00:06:27.971,00:06:29.972,That is very mature of you.
00:06:30.056,00:06:33.059,"I figure, if football fans can learn it, how hard can it be?"
00:06:33.143,00:06:34.810,That’s very elitist of you.
00:06:34.894,00:06:37.063,"I’m taking baby steps here, all right?"
00:06:37.147,00:06:39.440,I’m actually– I’m really looking forward to it.
00:06:39.524,00:06:41.442,’Cause it’s not just the game.
00:06:44.821,00:06:47.532,Don’t forget about the team mascots.
00:06:47.616,00:06:49.951,No. Mascots. With an M.
00:06:50.035,00:06:51.953,That could have been very embarrassing.
00:06:52.037,00:06:53.955,Okay.
00:06:54.039,00:06:56.041,Am I straight?
00:06:57.375,00:07:00.419,I’m not sure what you are right now.
00:07:00.503,00:07:02.505,"Hi, hi, hi, hi! How ya doin’?"
00:07:02.589,00:07:04.298,"Hey, Gramps."
00:07:04.382,00:07:06.092,"Hi, Phil. Good to see ya."
00:07:06.176,00:07:08.553,Let me guess. Game’s on?
00:07:08.637,00:07:11.097,Hey. For you.
00:07:11.181,00:07:14.308,"It’s nice to see you, Gloria."
00:07:14.392,00:07:18.771,"Okay, well– She means we’ve seen them two times today."
00:07:18.855,00:07:21.190,"Okay, everybody, the food’s in there. The drinks are in there."
00:07:21.274,00:07:23.818,"- I’ll be in here. - Hold on, Jay."
00:07:26.404,00:07:30.200,"Uh, Luke, Manny. Bring it in."
00:07:31.368,00:07:34.620,Come on. Huddle up. Football.
00:07:34.704,00:07:39.584,"Now in light of what happened at school today, do you have any feelings you’d like to express?"
00:07:39.668,00:07:44.213,"I think this is the proper forum– For God’s sakes. All right, both of you."
00:07:44.297,00:07:48.551,"Now, in this family, do we kick and punch each other, or do we love each other?"
00:07:48.635,00:07:50.845,That’s right.
00:07:50.929,00:07:52.889,I’ll be in the den.
00:07:55.350,00:07:58.311,"So, I brought dessert."
00:07:58.395,00:08:00.313,Okay. Thank you.
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.815,I make pie too.
00:08:06.152,00:08:08.070,"Okay, whoa. Whoa."
00:08:08.154,00:08:11.115,Everybody take a deep breath. Let’s think about getting real.
00:08:11.199,00:08:13.868,"- Phil, no. - Why Phil, no?"
00:08:13.952,00:08:15.995,What is Phil doing?
00:08:16.079,00:08:17.955,There’s tension between you two.
00:08:18.039,00:08:20.249,Bam. It’s out there.
00:08:20.333,00:08:23.919,"I think he’s right, and I think we should talk about it."
00:08:24.003,00:08:29.842,That’s what I’m talkin’ ’bout– you two talking...
00:08:29.926,00:08:31.928,’bout it.
00:08:36.766,00:08:39.852,"Haley hates it, which is weird because it’s all boys..."
00:08:39.936,00:08:41.937,and there’s no reading required.
00:08:42.021,00:08:45.650,Do you know that she spends at least 45 minutes every morning doing her hair?
00:08:45.734,00:08:54.116,And then sometimes– Looks like I gotta watch the game with Dick Butkus.
00:08:54.200,00:08:56.202,"Dad! Dad, come on. That’s offensive."
00:08:56.286,00:08:58.746,"Mitchell, he’s one of the greatest linebackers to ever play at Illinois..."
00:08:58.830,00:09:00.915,and one of my personal heroes.
00:09:00.999,00:09:02.792,And his name is Butt-kiss?
00:09:02.876,00:09:06.212,We’re just choosing to– Okay. All right.
00:09:06.296,00:09:08.255,"Dad, I thought you were being homophobic. I’m sorry."
00:09:08.339,00:09:10.341,We got all night.
00:09:10.425,00:09:14.011,"- Are you joining us here? - Yeah. Jay, you know what? He’s been studying up."
00:09:14.095,00:09:16.722,"I gotta tell ya, I’m a little worried about C.J. Hightower."
00:09:16.806,00:09:20.142,Right? With the bad ankle? I’m wondering how he’s gonna run his corner routes.
00:09:20.226,00:09:22.937,- Hightower’s out. - What?
00:09:23.021,00:09:24.939,Oh. Then who is gonna run the corner routes?
00:09:25.023,00:09:26.732,I’ll tell you who it won’t be– Billings.
00:09:29.319,00:09:31.570,"Oh, wow. Yeah. Then no."
00:09:31.654,00:09:34.240,"Double tight end, it’s gonna be a quarterback roll-out to the left."
00:09:34.324,00:09:38.619,Trust me. He’s got the slot. In the end zone! Touchdown!
00:09:38.703,00:09:42.123,"Lucky call. Maybe they, uh, should’ve considered blitzing."
00:09:42.207,00:09:44.250,Blitzing wouldn’t have helped them. Get outta here.
00:09:47.837,00:09:51.132,"So, my interest in football ended as suddenly and dramatically..."
00:09:51.216,00:09:53.676,as the climax of West Side Story.
00:09:53.760,00:09:55.678,I’m a musical theater fan.
00:09:55.762,00:09:58.848,Surprise.
00:09:58.932,00:10:02.935,Okay. The truth? I sometimes feel like you don’t like me.
00:10:03.019,00:10:04.895,Wow.
00:10:04.979,00:10:07.440,"Powerful, powerful stuff."
00:10:07.524,00:10:09.442,Claire? Tell us how that makes you feel.
00:10:09.526,00:10:12.945,"Right now, I’m feeling a lot of anger."
00:10:13.029,00:10:15.030,"Gloria, right now, I’m really angry at Phil."
00:10:19.369,00:10:22.288,"Gloria, I don’t know why you think I don’t like you."
00:10:22.372,00:10:25.291,"Sometimes when you see me, you make that face."
00:10:25.375,00:10:27.877,- Like this. - I do not make a face like that.
00:10:27.961,00:10:29.837,"Oh, my God. That is so Claire."
00:10:29.921,00:10:34.133,See? She does that with everyone. It’s just her face.
00:10:36.553,00:10:39.889,"From the beginning, I feel like Manny and I are not welcome in this family."
00:10:50.567,00:10:57.156,"I really am, because from the moment I met you, I have tried to make you feel comfortable with us."
00:10:57.240,00:10:59.533,You think it’s all in my head?
00:10:59.617,00:11:01.660,No. Kind– I don’t know.
00:11:01.744,00:11:05.706,"I mean, we really love having you and Manny in our family."
00:11:05.790,00:11:06.874,Really?
00:11:09.627,00:11:11.879,"I do that, don’t I?"
00:11:11.963,00:11:14.507,"Well, a bit."
00:11:18.094,00:11:20.971,"I was thinking group hug, but this is nice."
00:11:21.055,00:11:23.224,"I’d be there if I could. Oh, my God. There’s hugging."
00:11:23.308,00:11:25.309,"Haley, get off the phone already."
00:11:28.771,00:11:30.523,"Oh, my God. You’re such a girl."
00:11:30.607,00:11:33.108,Dad– I was coming to get a beer anyways.
00:11:33.192,00:11:35.903,Nice apology.
00:11:42.911,00:11:45.371,"Oh, we can learn so much from the children."
00:11:45.455,00:11:48.874,"Bet it seems kind of silly now what you were even fighting about, huh?"
00:11:48.958,00:11:52.127,- I made fun of his accent. - What accent?
00:11:52.211,00:11:54.588,I made fun of him for having the same thing for lunch every day.
00:11:58.843,00:12:00.761,What?
00:12:00.845,00:12:02.596,He said you were a coal digger.
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.600,Who said I was a coal digger?
00:12:06.684,00:12:09.728,That’s what my mom told me. What’s a coal digger?
00:12:09.812,00:12:11.772,"Sweetheart, he heard it wrong. It’s gold digger."
00:12:11.856,00:12:13.774,I’m gonna have to call you back.
00:12:13.858,00:12:16.735,I really do not think that I remember ever saying that.
00:12:16.819,00:12:19.071,"Well, you said in the car."
00:12:19.155,00:12:24.702,"You said it at Christmas. You said it in the Mexican restaurant– Okay, Mr. Leaves His Sweatshirts at School Every Day..."
00:12:24.786,00:12:26.788,"Suddenly Remembers Everything, thank you."
00:12:27.997,00:12:29.874,"And it was all in my head, huh?"
00:12:29.958,00:12:34.837,"Oh, listen. Gloria, it was... like, a year ago, before I knew you."
00:12:34.921,00:12:38.174,Nice going. Now my mom and my sister are fighting.
00:12:42.261,00:12:46.557,"If I say something that everybody else is thinking, does that make me a mean person?"
00:12:46.641,00:12:50.269,Or does it make me a brave person?
00:12:50.353,00:12:54.773,One who is courageous enough to stand up and-and say something...
00:12:54.857,00:12:57.777,behind someone’s back to... a 10-year-old.
00:12:59.612,00:13:02.281,"Well, she’s pissed."
00:13:02.365,00:13:05.117,Yeah. She wouldn’t even come out of her room.
00:13:05.201,00:13:08.078,Did you really have to call her that– a gold digger?
00:13:10.373,00:13:12.958,And it was a natural question to ask.
00:13:13.042,00:13:20.382,"She’s a beautiful, hot woman, and you’re not exactly, you know– Not exactly what?"
00:13:20.466,00:13:23.510,"Um– Mitchell, little help?"
00:13:23.594,00:13:25.512,No. You are doing great.
00:13:25.596,00:13:30.476,"See, this is exactly why we sweep things under the rug– so people don’t get hurt."
00:13:30.560,00:13:33.812,"Yeah, until you sweep too much under the rug. Then you got a lumpy rug."
00:13:33.896,00:13:38.025,Creates a tripping hazard. You open yourself up to lawsuits.
00:13:38.109,00:13:40.445,"Boy, you can go a really long time without blinking."
00:13:47.201,00:13:49.912,Gloria? It’s Phil.
00:13:49.996,00:13:53.040,Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?
00:13:53.124,00:13:55.960,Claire likes to say you can be part of the problem...
00:13:56.044,00:13:58.045,or part of the solution.
00:13:58.129,00:14:00.631,But I happen to believe that you can be both.
00:14:01.966,00:14:05.427,"Listen, Claire feels terrible."
00:14:05.511,00:14:07.513,Why don’t you talk to her?
00:14:07.597,00:14:11.350,Why? I know what she thinks– a coal digger.
00:14:11.434,00:14:14.019,"- You know she’s saying gold digger? - Yes, Phil!"
00:14:14.103,00:14:15.771,"Well, I-I know she said that."
00:14:15.855,00:14:18.565,"But that was a long time ago, before she knew you."
00:14:18.649,00:14:20.776,Does Jay buy me nice things?
00:14:20.860,00:14:23.028,Yes! Of course! All beautiful things.
00:14:26.282,00:14:28.158,All the colors.
00:14:28.242,00:14:31.579,"Do you think I can’t live without this? Take them away, Phil."
00:14:32.914,00:14:36.917,"Gloria, we all know you’d be fine without underwear."
00:14:37.001,00:14:39.545,"I mean, we know it’s not about that."
00:14:39.629,00:14:43.590,No. It’s about me not being accepted by my new family.
00:14:43.674,00:14:47.761,"That is not true. Gloria, look, you’re a beautiful woman."
00:14:47.845,00:14:51.056,"In fact, you’re probably one of those beautiful women who doesn’t even know it."
00:14:51.140,00:14:53.434,"No, I know it."
00:14:53.518,00:14:57.104,So it’s natural for Claire to wonder about you and her dad.
00:14:57.188,00:15:00.482,This family’s very protective of each other.
00:15:00.566,00:15:03.527,I remember the first time Claire brought me home.
00:15:03.611,00:15:06.447,Do you think Jay thought I was good enough for his little girl?
00:15:06.531,00:15:13.162,"No way. But over time, he realized that I loved Claire as much as he did."
00:15:13.246,00:15:15.790,"And by then, Mitch had brought Cam home, so I was golden."
00:15:17.041,00:15:20.002,Claire just needs a little time.
00:15:20.086,00:15:23.631,"And then, trust me, she’ll be the most loyal friend you’ve ever had."
00:15:26.759,00:15:28.844,"You’re not leaving, are you?"
00:15:28.928,00:15:31.013,"You know, there’s kind of a lot of drama."
00:15:31.097,00:15:33.265,So we’re torn.
00:15:33.349,00:15:38.270,Your sister said that Gloria would never go for anybody who looked like me.
00:15:38.354,00:15:42.274,"Now, you guys basically are like women."
00:15:42.358,00:15:44.777,"You know, you look at guys."
00:15:44.861,00:15:46.695,So what do you think?
00:15:46.779,00:15:49.114,You’re seriously asking us if you’re attractive?
00:15:49.198,00:15:51.200,"Well, I know I’m no Erik Estrada or anything."
00:15:51.284,00:15:53.911,I’m just curious is all.
00:15:53.995,00:15:59.458,"So if I was in one of your bars and– Righteous Brothers were on, you know."
00:15:59.542,00:16:03.962,"Would you, uh, I don’t know, check me out?"
00:16:04.046,00:16:06.882,"Dad, you’re really close to ruining gay for me."
00:16:06.966,00:16:08.967,"All right, fine. Whatever."
00:16:09.051,00:16:13.847,I think it’s– I just think it’s a little weird for a son to say this to his father.
00:16:13.931,00:16:17.559,"But for the record, I think you’re smokin’ hot."
00:16:17.643,00:16:20.020,"Yeah, 100%. You’re totally my type."
00:16:20.104,00:16:25.067,"You’re dangerous, you’re getable, you have a little cashola in your pocket."
00:16:25.151,00:16:30.531,"Face, body, the whole– The whole kit and caboodle, I think. Really."
00:16:30.615,00:16:32.950,What about a seven?
00:16:33.034,00:16:35.661,But you knew that.
00:16:35.745,00:16:37.705,"Okay, isn’t there a game on?"
00:16:39.415,00:16:42.210,Touchy.
00:16:44.962,00:16:47.715,"Gloria? Come on, let’s– let’s talk about this."
00:16:48.925,00:16:51.093,I’ve seen her kick in a door before.
00:16:56.432,00:16:59.560,I don’t know what my husband is saying to you or...
00:16:59.644,00:17:01.646,why he’s covered in your underwear.
00:17:03.814,00:17:06.525,Obviously I’m trying to seduce him for his money.
00:17:06.609,00:17:08.694,"’Cause that’s what I do, right?"
00:17:08.778,00:17:10.445,What do I have to give back...
00:17:10.529,00:17:14.324,so that everyone trusts me? Huh?
00:17:14.408,00:17:16.034,These earrings?
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.787,What? This bracelet?
00:17:18.871,00:17:21.332,My new dress?
00:17:24.710,00:17:27.713,I didn’t respond because...
00:17:27.797,00:17:32.050,this shouldn’t be about me.
00:17:32.134,00:17:33.886,It should be about you...
00:17:33.970,00:17:37.974,talking to you... about it.
00:17:40.518,00:17:42.477,Phil? Honey?
00:17:42.561,00:17:44.438,"No, no, no. No."
00:17:45.439,00:17:47.399,You’re welcome.
00:17:49.902,00:17:53.239,"I don’t know what to say except for that I am really, really sorry."
00:17:54.907,00:17:58.785,Just tell me one thing. How do you really feel that I’m with your father?
00:17:58.869,00:18:03.040,"Uh, well– Honestly, at first, it was hard."
00:18:03.124,00:18:05.167,"I mean, you don’t expect to wake up one morning..."
00:18:05.251,00:18:08.462,with a new mom who looks like she fell off a mud flap.
00:18:08.546,00:18:11.256,But... I’m getting used to it.
00:18:11.340,00:18:21.600,"And the important thing is you make him happy, which you do in– in so many ways, so many colors."
00:18:23.352,00:18:25.771,Are we okay?
00:18:25.855,00:18:28.106,- No. - No?
00:18:28.190,00:18:30.776,You embarrassed me in front of everyone downstairs.
00:18:30.860,00:18:33.111,"What, I’m supposed just to forget about it?"
00:18:36.866,00:18:40.369,Go jump in the pool.
00:18:40.453,00:18:43.789,Go jump in the pool with your clothes on. Then I know you’re sorry.
00:18:43.873,00:18:45.999,"I’m not gonna do that, Gloria."
00:18:46.083,00:18:48.836,Okay. Then I won’t forgive you.
00:18:50.880,00:18:52.881,Now a field goal beats us.
00:18:52.965,00:18:54.883,"Hey, you guys work that out?"
00:18:54.967,00:18:56.969,Almost. Gloria just wants me to jump in the pool.
00:18:57.053,00:18:58.929,Okay then.
00:18:59.013,00:19:02.892,"If they could get a pass rush on ’em, something, a break."
00:19:06.604,00:19:09.273,This is so awesome.
00:19:09.357,00:19:11.358,I know. Mom does not look good wet.
00:19:11.442,00:19:13.652,"Gloria, is this really necessary?"
00:19:13.736,00:19:16.405,"Dad, it’s fine. It’s fine. If I need to jump in this water..."
00:19:16.489,00:19:18.740,"to prove to Gloria how sorry I am, I will do it."
00:19:18.824,00:19:21.368,I’m fine.
00:19:21.452,00:19:24.663,- You’re serious? You’re not gonna stop me? - Why would I do that?
00:19:24.747,00:19:40.846,Because I am standing here. I am showing you my willingness to– - Are you happy? - Yes! I forgive you!
00:19:40.930,00:19:43.724,"- Then give me your hand. - Oh, that’s the oldest trick in the book."
00:19:43.808,00:19:45.851,She’s gonna pull you in there.
00:19:51.273,00:19:53.191,"This is funny, but this is also a teaching moment."
00:19:53.275,00:19:54.735,Yeah!
00:20:01.534,00:20:04.745,Cannonball!
00:20:07.790,00:20:11.209,How could he fumble that?
00:20:11.293,00:20:13.253,Center blew the snap.
00:20:13.337,00:20:16.590,"I played center, and I always got blamed for a quarterback’s clumsy hands."
00:20:16.674,00:20:18.884,"Well, I was a quarterback, and it was probably your fault."
00:20:18.968,00:20:20.886,It’s impossible to fumble the ball...
00:20:20.970,00:20:23.221,when the quarterback has the proper hand placement.
00:20:23.305,00:20:26.099,It’s weird to think of a woman being sexually attracted to Dad.
00:20:26.183,00:20:29.978,"No, you wanna hear weird? Cam said he’d pick up Dad at a gay bar."
00:20:30.062,00:20:33.231,Ooh. How did that come up?
00:20:33.315,00:20:35.400,"As far as I’m concerned, Mom and Dad had sex two times."
00:20:35.484,00:20:37.402,Agreed.
00:20:37.486,00:20:40.322,"Okay, get your hands up there like you’re lifting me off the ground."
00:20:40.406,00:20:42.824,"Be one with me, Jay. There you go."
00:20:42.908,00:20:46.411,Do you wanna get something to eat?
00:20:46.495,00:20:48.246,Just snap the damn thing.
00:00:04.296,00:00:07.173,"Okay, your brother’s lunch is packed. You’re buying your own lunch."
00:00:07.257,00:00:09.342,"Luke, Alex, come on. Let’s go."
00:00:09.426,00:00:12.387,There he is. Last chance for the summer handshake.
00:00:15.933,00:00:17.684,Dad.
00:00:17.768,00:00:19.435,Come on. We’re only halfway done.
00:00:19.519,00:00:21.187,I need help.
00:00:21.271,00:00:24.107,I was supposed to keep a journal all summer. It’s due today.
00:00:24.191,00:00:27.110,"Wow, first day of school and you’re already behind?"
00:00:27.194,00:00:30.405,I’m dead.
00:00:30.489,00:00:32.157,Okay.
00:00:32.241,00:00:35.368,- June 21. Found a stick. - Mmm.
00:00:35.452,00:00:38.121,June 22. That’s it.
00:00:38.205,00:00:41.124,That’s it? It was a really cool stick.
00:00:41.208,00:00:43.626,He’s right. It looked like a snake.
00:00:43.710,00:00:48.381,"Getting everybody out of the house in the morning can be really tough, especially the first day of school."
00:00:48.465,00:00:52.177,"From the minute we get up at 7:00 till we drop ’em off at school, it is go, go, go."
00:00:52.261,00:00:54.637,I get up at 6:00.
00:00:54.721,00:00:56.639,I get up at 5:00.
00:00:56.723,00:00:59.142,Seriously. I get up at 6:00.
00:00:59.226,00:01:01.644,That’s you? I thought we had a raccoon.
00:01:01.728,00:01:05.648,I can’t believe my little boy is going into the fifth grade.
00:01:05.732,00:01:10.445,He used to hold my finger with his little hand and look at me with those big eyes.
00:01:10.529,00:01:12.572,"Mi niño pequeño, Jay."
00:01:12.656,00:01:14.574,"Yup, they grow up."
00:01:14.658,00:01:17.828,"Come on, Manny. Let’s get going."
00:01:18.829,00:01:21.247,How’s my hair?
00:01:21.331,00:01:23.750,Hold on. What are you wearing there?
00:01:23.834,00:01:25.919,That looks like an old Christmas tree skirt.
00:01:26.003,00:01:28.087,It’s a traditional Colombian poncho.
00:01:28.171,00:01:31.424,I want my new classmates to know I’m proud of my heritage.
00:01:31.508,00:01:35.053,I think you look very handsome. Lindo.
00:01:35.137,00:01:38.515,"Oh, really? Am I driving him to school or is he gonna ride his burro?"
00:01:44.896,00:01:46.564,Are you still baby-proofing?
00:01:46.648,00:01:48.483,Everything we own is pointy.
00:01:48.567,00:01:51.110,Why is our daughter dressed like Donna Summer?
00:01:54.865,00:01:56.783,How is Daddy not seeing that?
00:02:00.537,00:02:04.040,I guess I’m somewhat of a shutterbug.
00:02:04.124,00:02:07.293,"And my new favorite model, of course, is Lily."
00:02:07.377,00:02:11.297,I just completed a series of photographs of her dressed as various pop icons.
00:02:11.381,00:02:14.175,Let’s see. I’ve done Olivia Newton-John.
00:02:14.259,00:02:23.142,"I’ve done Madonna, the early years, Stevie Wonder– Yeah, there are days when Lily has more costume changes than Cher."
00:02:23.226,00:02:25.561,Cher! How could I forget Cher? That’s embarrassing.
00:02:25.645,00:02:28.189,That’s embarrassing?
00:02:42.996,00:02:44.664,"Honey, you moving out?"
00:02:44.748,00:02:46.624,Five more years.
00:02:46.708,00:02:49.919,A little help here?
00:02:50.003,00:02:53.089,A cello is more in demand in university orchestras.
00:02:53.173,00:02:54.841,You know what’s not in demand?
00:02:54.925,00:02:56.551,Girls who play in university orchestras.
00:02:56.635,00:02:58.845,"Here, I’ll help you carry it out to the curb."
00:02:58.929,00:03:00.596,"Phil, put on some pants."
00:03:00.680,00:03:03.349,Come on! This covers up more than my bathing suit.
00:03:03.433,00:03:07.937,"And don’t remind me. Haley, honey– Don’t forget, the driving instructor is picking you up from school."
00:03:08.021,00:03:09.939,Can’t he pick me up someplace else?
00:03:10.023,00:03:11.941,I don’t want kids at school thinking I’m dating...
00:03:12.025,00:03:13.901,a 40-year-old driving instructor who’s not even cute.
00:03:13.985,00:03:15.903,Haley just got her learner’s permit.
00:03:15.987,00:03:18.239,We’ve been taking turns driving with her.
00:03:22.119,00:03:25.455,is we want to keep a safe distance between us and the car in front.
00:03:25.539,00:03:28.041,And that is not safe right there. Not safe.
00:03:28.125,00:03:32.253,I– Merge. Merge!
00:03:32.337,00:03:34.255,Merge! Merge! Merge!
00:03:34.339,00:03:37.550,This navigation system is all messed up.
00:03:37.634,00:03:39.552,It thinks we’re in a park.
00:03:39.636,00:03:41.554,"Oh, my God! It is a park!"
00:03:41.638,00:03:44.307,Away from the kids! Aim for the lake!
00:03:45.642,00:03:48.979,Makes you realize we’re all just hanging by a thread.
00:03:50.480,00:03:52.899,The last thing Manny needs on his first day of school...
00:03:52.983,00:03:55.109,is you undermelting his confidence.
00:03:55.193,00:03:57.320,- Undermining. - Now you’re doing it to me too.
00:03:57.404,00:04:03.242,"I’m sorry, but there’s only two places anyone should wear a poncho– Niagara Falls and log rides."
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.203,You think too much about these things.
00:04:05.287,00:04:10.458,"I wear all sort of daring outfits all the time, and people admire them because I wear them with the confidence."
00:04:14.713,00:04:17.840,I just– I just think it’s a little over-the-top.
00:04:17.924,00:04:20.093,You know what? You need to loosen up and have fun.
00:04:20.177,00:04:23.096,"I am loose. I’m fun. Remember, uh, breakfast for dinner last week?"
00:04:23.180,00:04:25.098,My idea.
00:04:25.182,00:04:27.767,"Ever since we brought Lily home, you’ve been tense."
00:04:27.851,00:04:30.770,"All you do is put child locks on things, read parenting books."
00:04:30.854,00:04:33.272,"Would you please stop and– Here, just hold your daughter."
00:04:33.356,00:04:36.609,Hold her and relax.
00:04:36.693,00:04:38.694,Just relax.
00:04:38.778,00:04:41.114,Ohh. Did you put hair spray on this?
00:04:41.198,00:04:44.200,Just a little bit. I’m gonna put some music on.
00:04:44.284,00:04:46.285,Dance with her. Put a little boogie in it.
00:04:46.369,00:04:48.121,"Oh, come on."
00:04:48.205,00:04:51.040,Just dance. You know you love this song.
00:04:51.124,00:04:54.043,This is actually a really good song. All right. Okay.
00:05:02.511,00:05:04.137,"Oh, my– Was that her head?"
00:05:07.265,00:05:10.018,"Yeah, it was her head. Okay. Okay."
00:05:13.063,00:05:15.982,"Yes. Yes, I know."
00:05:16.066,00:05:18.443,I got Boo-boo Bear from the freezer.
00:05:18.527,00:05:21.446,Why do you have chocolate on your face?
00:05:21.530,00:05:24.323,So you ate your way to it?
00:05:24.407,00:05:27.326,Do you think she’s all right?
00:05:27.410,00:05:30.329,"Maybe that’s a bad sign. You know, we should try and make her laugh."
00:05:30.413,00:05:33.833,Why?
00:05:36.169,00:05:39.088,There you go.
00:05:39.172,00:05:41.090,Moo!
00:05:41.174,00:05:43.759,- But it’s a dog. - I know. That’s why it’s funny.
00:05:43.843,00:05:46.095,Moo. I don’t think it’s as funny as you think it is.
00:05:46.179,00:05:48.264,Can we please just call your sister?
00:05:46.179,00:05:53.102,"No, no. Cam– Cam– Why? So she can be all judgmental and condescending, like she’s the expert and I don’t know how to take care of a baby?"
00:05:53.186,00:05:55.605,"Mitchell, she is your family."
00:05:55.689,00:05:59.192,Of course she’s gonna be judgmental and condescending.
00:05:59.276,00:06:00.693,Hello?
00:06:00.777,00:06:03.738,"Hey, hi, um– Not a big deal. Just wondering."
00:06:03.822,00:06:08.284,"When your kids were small, did you ever– I don’t know– smack their heads into a wall?"
00:06:08.368,00:06:10.244,Usually we just gave time-outs.
00:06:14.332,00:06:20.254,"It wasn’t very hard and she’s not acting any differently, but I just worry– Relax. It happens."
00:06:20.338,00:06:23.382,Luke used to bang his head all the time and he’s fine.
00:06:23.466,00:06:26.385,"Okay, all right, thank you. Thanks. That helps. Okay, okay."
00:06:31.433,00:06:34.477,- Gloria? - I’m here.
00:06:34.561,00:06:39.398,"I, uh, just dropped Manny off at school, and I realized..."
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.651,I just dropped Manny off at school.
00:06:41.735,00:06:43.486,"Oh, boy."
00:06:43.570,00:06:48.032,And I was hoping we’d still have a few more good years before the mind started to go.
00:06:48.116,00:06:51.786,"No, what I’m saying, we have the day to ourselves, the first time in months."
00:06:51.870,00:06:53.996,We should take advantage of it.
00:06:54.080,00:06:58.334,"Go to the club, nice lunch, some massages."
00:06:58.418,00:07:01.087,What about work?
00:07:01.171,00:07:04.924,"Since I married you, people are surprised I come in at all."
00:07:08.470,00:07:12.390,"He’s always surprising me with little presents, fun getaways."
00:07:12.474,00:07:16.686,"I wasn’t the greatest husband the first time around, but I’m trying to do better this time."
00:07:16.770,00:07:19.772,"And maybe by my third marriage, I’ll have it down pat."
00:07:22.108,00:07:24.527,"Yeah, that one’s gonna cost me."
00:07:29.949,00:07:31.617,What ya reading there? A book?
00:07:31.701,00:07:33.786,Yeah. I’ve been meaning to get to it for a while.
00:07:33.870,00:07:36.497,"Ooh, it’s got a map at the beginning. I like it when books do that."
00:07:36.581,00:07:39.208,Mm-hmm.
00:07:39.292,00:07:42.295,Don’t you have an open house this morning? I rescheduled.
00:07:42.379,00:07:44.380,Thought you might like some company.
00:07:46.675,00:07:49.844,"Well, the first day of school can be tough for stay-at-home moms."
00:07:49.928,00:07:53.055,"Now, you have to understand, the kids are gone, the nest is empty."
00:07:53.139,00:07:55.641,They are rudderless.
00:07:55.725,00:08:00.980,"And a lot of guys wouldn’t even notice, but I’m not a lot of guys."
00:08:01.064,00:08:05.985,"I listen with my mind, and if you pay attention, women will tell you what they want..."
00:08:06.069,00:08:08.988,by telling you the opposite of what they want.
00:08:12.075,00:08:14.994,There’s no space in the garage for both of our cars.
00:08:15.078,00:08:18.915,"And what she’s really saying is that, you know, I should probably get a sports car."
00:08:20.125,00:08:23.044,I was sort of looking forward to a quiet day.
00:08:23.128,00:08:26.756,"Thought I’d just read, maybe go for a run later, that’s it."
00:08:26.840,00:08:28.550,Great. We’ll run together.
00:08:29.592,00:08:31.344,You don’t have to do that.
00:08:31.428,00:08:33.722,I know.
00:08:37.434,00:08:39.518,Listening.
00:08:39.602,00:08:42.229,"The thing is, I like to run alone."
00:08:42.313,00:08:47.693,"And I run kinda fast, so– So? So I’m not sure you’re gonna be able to keep up with me."
00:08:49.988,00:08:52.031,"You’re kid– You’re kidding, right?"
00:08:52.115,00:08:54.200,No.
00:08:54.284,00:08:56.452,I’m not sure you can keep up with this conversation.
00:08:58.538,00:09:02.667,"and that I wear my special shoes with the big soles, which were designed by a doctor."
00:09:07.297,00:09:09.882,You really think you can run as fast as me?
00:09:09.966,00:09:15.764,"No, Phil, I think I can run much, much faster... than you."
00:09:25.857,00:09:28.567,"Boom. Just like that, the whole day changed."
00:09:28.651,00:09:32.446,It was game on. She knew it. I knew it. We both knew it.
00:09:35.742,00:09:38.661,I think I’ll order what I had the last time. What was that called?
00:09:38.745,00:09:41.747,You want me to say it because you want me to roll my R’s.
00:09:46.586,00:09:49.630,"- Jay, what is this? - Oh, looks like my old car cover."
00:09:49.714,00:09:52.675,Don’t give me that. This is Manny’s poncho. What is it doing here?
00:09:52.759,00:09:56.595,- Maybe he decided to take it off on the way to school. - What did you say to him?
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.305,Nothing. I... told some jokes.
00:09:58.389,00:10:00.683,You say plenty with your jokes.
00:10:00.767,00:10:03.978,"Jay, he looks up to you. He respects your opinion."
00:10:04.062,00:10:07.106,We dodged a bullet on this. Trust me. I’ve been down this road before.
00:10:07.190,00:10:11.402,I remember one time Mitchell decided to wear a jaunty scarf to school.
00:10:11.486,00:10:15.281,I kept my mouth shut. He got his jaunty butt kicked.
00:10:15.365,00:10:21.787,"My dad has this perception that I was very flamboyant as a kid, which is just– it’s nonsense, because I kept the whole gay thing very under wraps."
00:10:21.871,00:10:24.498,"You know, I was just a guy’s guy."
00:10:24.582,00:10:26.459,I was basically a jock.
00:10:26.543,00:10:28.336,You know?
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.297,So we should crush Manny’s spirit...
00:10:31.381,00:10:33.841,and destroy everything that makes him who he is.
00:10:33.925,00:10:39.847,"I’m just saying, it’s no fun to see your kid get picked on every day, getting tormented just because he’s different."
00:10:39.931,00:10:42.016,"I’m telling you, it rips your heart out."
00:10:42.100,00:10:45.686,"Well, Batman doesn’t get picked on and he wears a cape."
00:10:45.770,00:10:48.689,A poncho is just a cape that goes all the way around.
00:10:48.773,00:10:51.484,Batman doesn’t get picked on because he’s a muscular genius.
00:10:51.568,00:10:53.861,Manny can’t make it to the top bunk.
00:10:53.945,00:10:58.283,We’re taking this poncho to Manny at school. It’s important that he knows we support him.
00:10:59.742,00:11:02.870,"And then we go get those massages, because that sounds good."
00:11:09.252,00:11:12.505,I always take the stairs two at a time. I don’t even think about it anymore.
00:11:12.589,00:11:14.381,The regular way would seem weird.
00:11:14.465,00:11:16.592,"Phil, let it go. I’m faster than you."
00:11:16.676,00:11:19.762,If only there was some way we could settle this once and for all.
00:11:19.846,00:11:21.847,But how?
00:11:21.931,00:11:23.599,Huh.
00:11:23.683,00:11:25.601,You seriously wanna race me?
00:11:25.685,00:11:27.603,I ran a half-marathon last year.
00:11:27.687,00:11:29.605,Wow. I’m half-scared.
00:11:29.689,00:11:32.191,"Okay, we do need to do this. I’ll go change."
00:11:32.275,00:11:35.027,Not now. I got a conference call. But how about after that?
00:11:35.111,00:11:37.572,- Great. This afternoon. - Sweet.
00:11:41.242,00:11:50.459,"Son of a– Gotta fix that step! Two at a time! Already at the top, so– Hi, I’m Dr. Miura. I’m on call today."
00:11:50.543,00:11:53.045,Looks like we have a little head bump.
00:11:53.129,00:11:55.381,"Yeah, it happened a couple hours ago on a– on a doorjamb."
00:11:55.465,00:11:57.716,"Uh, ouch."
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.385,We used to do this thing in school...
00:11:59.469,00:12:02.096,where they would give you an egg and you couldn’t break it.
00:12:02.180,00:12:06.225,And it was supposed to teach you how hard it was to be a parent.
00:12:06.309,00:12:10.521,"But the real thing, i-it’s so much harder. You know?"
00:12:10.605,00:12:13.899,We did that in my school too. Didn’t turn out so well.
00:12:13.983,00:12:15.901,I went through a dozen eggs.
00:12:15.985,00:12:17.570,"Yeah, well, he’s a nervous eater."
00:12:17.654,00:12:19.989,"No, I broke a dozen eggs."
00:12:21.741,00:12:25.411,I’m sorry. I just assumed that– I know.
00:12:25.495,00:12:28.080,I know what you assumed.
00:12:28.164,00:12:30.583,There doesn’t seem to be any mark.
00:12:30.667,00:12:33.752,"Well, her head was somewhat protected."
00:12:33.836,00:12:36.922,"- Was she wearing a hat? - Yes, yes, like a hat."
00:12:37.006,00:12:41.093,"It was a wig, actually. Sort of a ghetto-fabulous Afro thing."
00:12:43.179,00:12:47.099,Really? You thought ghetto-fabulous might be medically relevant?
00:12:47.183,00:12:50.644,Maybe I should just finish with the exam.
00:12:50.728,00:12:54.106,You’ll be pleased to know that Mitchell and I intend on raising Lily...
00:12:54.190,00:12:57.192,with influences from her Asian heritage.
00:12:57.276,00:12:59.194,That is fantastic.
00:13:02.031,00:13:03.949,"Uh, no. No, no, no."
00:13:04.033,00:13:06.452,We’ve hung some art in her room. Some Asian art.
00:13:06.536,00:13:10.456,"And then when she’s ready for solid food, there’s a fantastic pho place..."
00:13:10.540,00:13:12.458,right around the corner from our house.
00:13:12.542,00:13:17.296,Am I pronouncing that right? Is it pho? It’s a soup.
00:13:17.380,00:13:20.257,I don’t know. I’m from Denver.
00:13:20.341,00:13:23.678,We don’t have a lot of pho there.
00:13:25.221,00:13:29.350,"Uh, just to be sure, could you show me how hard Lily got hit?"
00:13:29.434,00:13:31.477,And use your head.
00:13:31.561,00:13:39.818,"Um, yeah. Really, it was– it was just sorta, like, uh– You know?"
00:13:39.902,00:13:42.571,"Um, it was just– just a head bump, you know."
00:13:42.655,00:13:44.990,How are you feeling?
00:13:47.076,00:13:49.995,"Babies are designed to survive new parents, so stop worrying."
00:13:50.079,00:13:51.748,You guys are doing great.
00:13:52.832,00:13:55.167,Thank you.
00:13:55.251,00:13:57.253,Denver.
00:14:15.855,00:14:18.232,I support Manny no matter what.
00:14:18.316,00:14:22.069,Children need to know that you believe in them. It’s the most important thing.
00:14:22.153,00:14:25.864,"If you tell them they have wings, they will believe they can fly."
00:14:25.948,00:14:27.616,"Oh, really?"
00:14:27.700,00:14:30.577,"I had a buddy, went to Woodstock, believed he could fly."
00:14:30.661,00:14:34.665,Didn’t end great. It’s why hotel windows don’t open anymore.
00:14:36.167,00:14:38.377,Is something wrong? Who’s died?
00:14:38.461,00:14:41.046,"No one, Manny. Why would you even think that?"
00:14:41.130,00:14:44.425,"In Colombia, Manny went to Pablo Escobar Elementary School."
00:14:47.845,00:14:49.513,"Well, we got your poncho here."
00:14:49.597,00:14:52.224,I thought you said it made me look like my neck was wearing a dress.
00:14:54.644,00:14:56.729,"What do you got there, buddy?"
00:14:56.813,00:14:59.732,I’m going to play some Colombian folk music for my new classmates.
00:14:59.816,00:15:01.734,Huh. Great.
00:15:04.320,00:15:06.864,I’m sure your friends are gonna love it.
00:15:06.948,00:15:08.574,Break the flute.
00:15:08.658,00:15:10.909,The poncho by itself is fine.
00:15:10.993,00:15:16.832,"The poncho, plus the flute, plus the stupid dance– my son will die a virgin."
00:15:16.916,00:15:18.667,That’s right.
00:15:18.751,00:15:21.754,"Hey, sport, can I take a look at that whistle?"
00:15:21.838,00:15:24.548,"Oh, geez. Look at that."
00:15:24.632,00:15:26.759,And now you stepped on it!
00:15:26.843,00:15:28.469,"Oh, darn!"
00:15:28.553,00:15:31.264,What’s wrong with me?
00:15:32.390,00:15:34.349,"Here, let me get it."
00:15:34.433,00:15:37.227,"You know– Actually, maybe you should do this."
00:15:37.311,00:15:40.522,"I don’t want to bump her head against the door, you know, pinch her with the seat belt."
00:15:40.606,00:15:42.983,"Mitchell, how long are you gonna beat yourself up over one mistake?"
00:15:43.067,00:15:45.277,Is this going to be like the blond highlights all over again?
00:15:48.364,00:15:51.033,What are you talking about? We’re new at this.
00:15:51.117,00:15:53.952,"Yeah, but you’re such a natural. I mean, look at you."
00:15:56.205,00:16:00.626,Y-You change her diaper with one hand. I– Nice. I-I’m actually jealous of you.
00:16:00.710,00:16:03.545,There are so many things that you do that I can’t.
00:16:03.629,00:16:05.547,Y-You baby-proofed the entire house.
00:16:05.631,00:16:07.800,You took care of all the adoption paperwork.
00:16:07.884,00:16:10.803,"Without you, we wouldn’t even have a baby to injure."
00:16:13.389,00:16:15.474,And you got her on all those preschool waiting lists.
00:16:15.558,00:16:18.018,Can’t believe you were gonna wait until she was old enough.
00:16:18.102,00:16:20.312,"You see, that’s what makes us a great team."
00:16:20.396,00:16:22.564,We each have our own strengths.
00:16:22.648,00:16:25.526,"Now, who are amazing parents?"
00:16:25.610,00:16:27.319,We are.
00:16:27.403,00:16:29.488,We are!
00:16:29.572,00:16:31.574,Okay.
00:16:34.243,00:16:37.162,Did we just lock our baby in the car? Did you put the keys in the bag?
00:16:37.246,00:16:40.707,I put the keys in the bag.
00:16:40.791,00:16:43.001,Come on! Don’t freak out!
00:16:50.509,00:16:53.178,Do all four doors lock?
00:16:55.598,00:16:57.224,I didn’t say anything.
00:16:57.308,00:16:59.184,Couldn’t hear ya. I’m cranking one of my mash-ups.
00:16:59.268,00:17:01.854,Ah.
00:17:01.938,00:17:05.232,There they are. How was the first day back in prison?
00:17:05.316,00:17:07.943,Fine.
00:17:08.027,00:17:10.612,What are you guys doing?
00:17:10.696,00:17:14.283,Your mom and I are racing to the mailbox on Sequoia and back.
00:17:14.367,00:17:17.202,- Why? - I don’t know.
00:17:19.872,00:17:22.541,"kicking a little Mom butt here, how about I school you in some Mario Kart?"
00:17:22.625,00:17:24.543,Can’t. Gotta work on my journal.
00:17:24.627,00:17:26.545,Lame!
00:17:26.629,00:17:29.548,"Hey, uh, Alex. You?"
00:17:36.764,00:17:38.557,Ready?
00:17:38.641,00:17:43.771,I was born ready. I came outta the womb wearing tiny little golden wings– Go!
00:17:48.651,00:17:51.320,Help! We l– We locked our baby in the car and people are judging us!
00:17:51.404,00:17:53.238,"I swear to God, I’m gonna break it!"
00:17:55.157,00:17:58.619,Please tell your wife to relax. Everything is going to be okay.
00:17:58.703,00:18:02.080,Really?
00:18:02.164,00:18:05.459,"Sir, we just sent the signal. The door should be unlocked now. Check– Check the door."
00:18:05.543,00:18:08.337,Check the door. Check the door.
00:18:08.421,00:18:10.339,Oh. Oh.
00:18:10.423,00:18:13.342,That is amazing. How did they do that?
00:18:21.183,00:18:25.437,There is no way I’m going to lose a two-mile race to Johnny Ski Pole.
00:18:28.649,00:18:32.194,"Saving my energy, drafting off of you."
00:18:33.529,00:18:36.448,You feeling cocky?
00:18:39.702,00:18:43.247,"But after seeing that T-shirt, I realized something."
00:18:45.166,00:18:51.380,"The first day of school is tough on all my kids, especially the one I married."
00:18:53.215,00:18:56.802,Boop-boop-boop! Afterburners engaged!
00:18:56.886,00:19:00.222,Whoo! Don’t choke on my smoke!
00:19:00.306,00:19:02.474,And down the stretch he goes.
00:19:02.558,00:19:04.977,I don’t believe it!
00:19:05.061,00:19:08.522,Daddy wins! Do you believe in miracles?
00:19:08.606,00:19:12.526,"U.S.A., U.S.– Oh, no!"
00:19:14.945,00:19:16.863,"Oh, my– What was that? Was that a person?"
00:19:16.947,00:19:18.991,I’m good! I’m good.
00:19:19.075,00:19:21.827,"Honey, are you okay?"
00:19:21.911,00:19:23.913,"You’re getting better, sweetheart."
00:19:25.998,00:19:30.043,Did I lose the race to make him feel better?
00:19:30.127,00:19:31.878,Maybe.
00:19:31.962,00:19:35.800,But it just seemed like he could use a win today.
00:19:40.763,00:19:44.057,We do strange things for the people we love.
00:19:44.141,00:19:47.269,"We lie to them, we lie for them."
00:19:50.689,00:19:56.111,"There may be some bumps along the way, but we never stop wanting the best for them."
00:19:56.195,00:19:59.615,That’s what makes it such a tough job.
00:20:00.866,00:20:04.120,Kind of the best job in the world.
00:20:05.996,00:20:08.123,What are you doing? Turn your eyes on the road!
00:20:08.207,00:20:10.292,"Oh, my God!"
00:20:15.256,00:20:17.132,Okay. Okay.
00:20:17.216,00:20:19.176,"All right, sweetie, this happens."
00:20:19.260,00:20:21.178,Remain calm. That’s the first thing.
00:20:21.262,00:20:24.181,Pull over right here. I’ll get out the registration.
00:20:24.265,00:20:26.808,Pull over right there.
00:20:26.892,00:20:29.603,You need to pull over!
00:20:29.687,00:20:31.605,Phil!
00:20:31.689,00:20:35.734,"Parking ticket from the mall. I never paid the parking ticket. Keep moving, sweetheart."
00:20:35.818,00:20:37.486,Dad agrees with me. I can speed up.
00:00:04.796,00:00:08.884,Bravo! Bravo!
00:00:18.101,00:00:20.687,Bravo!
00:00:20.771,00:00:23.022,"Bravo, Manny! Bravo!"
00:00:37.371,00:00:41.082,"I’m proud of our little Zorro. I worked with him a little, but the kid’s got skills."
00:00:41.166,00:00:45.044,It’s in his blood. His father was a master swordsman.
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.213,He was an artist with his sword.
00:00:49.883,00:00:51.801,"I mean, he was legendary."
00:00:51.885,00:00:53.887,You know this nice moment I’m having with your son?
00:00:53.971,00:00:56.931,You’re kind of wrecking it.
00:00:59.309,00:01:01.811,Did you know that fencing goes back to the 12th century?
00:01:01.895,00:01:05.732,You know what’s even nerdier than fencing? Knowing when it began.
00:01:05.816,00:01:08.902,"I don’t think you’re a nerd, Alex."
00:01:08.986,00:01:12.155,All right. That’s my boy!
00:01:14.324,00:01:15.992,Would this be easier...
00:01:16.076,00:01:17.911,if we suspended you from a crane?
00:01:21.873,00:01:24.709,"But, Cameron, you always just take things a little too far."
00:01:24.793,00:01:26.711,"Okay, your nephew’s first birthday."
00:01:26.795,00:01:29.797,You brought a wind machine.
00:01:26.795,00:01:31.549,"To be fair, my vision was– Cameron, you brought a wind machine."
00:01:31.633,00:01:33.719,Who puts wheels on cribs?
00:01:44.521,00:01:45.563,That’s okay.
00:01:45.647,00:01:47.857,"No. No, no, no, no! My phone died."
00:01:47.941,00:01:50.777,No biggie. Your battery probably just statically defracticated.
00:01:50.861,00:01:52.779,What?
00:01:52.863,00:01:55.240,It means you can recharge it with static electricity.
00:01:55.324,00:01:57.200,Just rub it on your hair.
00:02:01.038,00:02:08.544,"You know, I used to go to the houses of my friends, I’d see their kids’ trophies, and it used to bug me, you know, because there was never a trophy in my house."
00:02:19.723,00:02:22.183,"Cam, people are staring."
00:02:22.267,00:02:26.729,"I know you’re not supposed to care, but it’s kind of cool to have a kid in your house who’s the best at something."
00:02:26.813,00:02:28.815,You know what I mean?
00:02:31.151,00:02:33.653,"Yeah, our kids are great."
00:02:33.737,00:02:36.406,"Gosh, we’re blessed."
00:02:33.737,00:02:38.950,"We are. But, um, are they the best at something?"
00:02:39.034,00:02:40.952,I’d have to think about that.
00:02:41.036,00:02:45.665,"Well, Alex is great at every single thing she tries, so, you know, she’ll find her specialty."
00:02:45.749,00:02:54.674,And Haley is– Haley is so pretty.
00:02:54.758,00:02:56.884,"Gorgeous, gorgeous girl."
00:02:56.968,00:03:00.513,So she can meet someone who’s the best at something.
00:03:00.597,00:03:03.225,"And then, uh, I guess that leaves Luke."
00:03:07.896,00:03:10.398,We dropped the ball a little bit on that one.
00:03:24.079,00:03:25.538,Bravo!
00:03:25.622,00:03:30.710,"How about a nice round of applause for our winner, Manny Delgado."
00:03:30.794,00:03:36.799,"Manny now moves on to the championship, where he’ll be competing against Caroline Markum."
00:03:45.225,00:03:47.143,What she said.
00:03:47.227,00:03:51.105,Wow. This means more to Dad than it does to Manny.
00:03:51.189,00:03:54.776,"Yeah, it’s his chance to be father of a champion. Well, second chance."
00:03:54.860,00:03:58.404,We all know how the first time went.
00:03:58.488,00:04:01.908,"No, no. I’m– I’m very happy for Manny."
00:04:05.328,00:04:07.914,I wanna thank you guys for coming by and supporting the kid.
00:04:18.508,00:04:21.302,That took a while.
00:04:21.386,00:04:24.430,It just took me some time to sneak out without waking her up.
00:04:24.514,00:04:26.432,Kind of like the first time you slept over here.
00:04:26.516,00:04:28.267,I had a meeting.
00:04:31.438,00:04:33.398,What’s up with you and your sister?
00:04:33.482,00:04:35.983,Nothing is up.
00:04:36.067,00:04:40.447,Or could this have something to do with... ice skating?
00:04:42.240,00:04:44.909,- When Mitchell and Claire were kids– - This is interesting to no one.
00:04:44.993,00:04:47.036,"Excuse, please. Let me finish. Thank you."
00:04:47.120,00:04:49.038,When Mitchell was 10– Eleven.
00:04:49.122,00:04:52.041,"and Claire was 13, they were competitive ice dancers– Figure skaters!"
00:04:52.125,00:04:56.963,"Oh, for God’s sakes, I’ll tell the story. Yes, my sister and I were actually a very good team."
00:04:57.047,00:04:58.965,We were called Fire and Nice.
00:04:59.049,00:05:05.805,"I was Fire, because of the red hair, and Claire was Nice, because it was ironic and she wasn’t."
00:05:05.889,00:05:09.142,And Mitchell is still upset because Claire quit the team right before some meet.
00:05:09.226,00:05:12.478,“Some meet.” The 13-and-under regional championships.
00:05:12.562,00:05:15.064,Just the Emerald City at the end of my yellow brick road.
00:05:15.148,00:05:17.733,Wow. You did it.
00:05:17.817,00:05:20.487,You made figure skating sound even gayer.
00:05:22.030,00:05:23.656,"So, seeing your dad so proud of Manny..."
00:05:23.740,00:05:25.825,didn’t stir up any resentment?
00:05:25.909,00:05:28.661,Mm-mmm.
00:05:28.745,00:05:36.210,"Okay, fine. You always do this. Instead of letting your feelings out, you bury them, and then they bubble up later in hurtful ways."
00:05:40.507,00:05:45.219,embarrassing and petty and it’s not a good color on me.
00:05:47.097,00:05:49.015,You love me in my yellow shirt.
00:05:49.099,00:05:51.058,It makes you look like the sun.
00:05:51.142,00:05:53.311,Bubbling. Hurtful bubbling.
00:05:53.395,00:05:56.022,- Now you know why I left early that morning. - Ha!
00:05:56.106,00:05:59.609,"I knew you didn’t have a meeting, Cam. I knew it."
00:06:03.113,00:06:04.989,There must be something wrong with this phone.
00:06:05.073,00:06:07.033,"I’ve rubbed it on my head for, like, an hour."
00:06:08.076,00:06:10.411,What? Alex.
00:06:13.206,00:06:15.625,At least I didn’t give myself a bald spot.
00:06:15.709,00:06:17.543,"Oh, my God! Mom!"
00:06:17.627,00:06:21.214,"Alex, don’t be mean. Haley, stop making yourself such an easy target."
00:06:23.550,00:06:25.676,What are you guys doing?
00:06:25.760,00:06:30.932,We make a list of areas the boy might excel at and... baseball. Love it.
00:06:31.016,00:06:34.060,"Yeah. I read it only takes 10,000 hours to achieve excellence."
00:06:34.144,00:06:36.562,"You’ve already got, what, how many hours playing ball?"
00:06:36.646,00:06:42.235,"Well, I played, like, one season, so, like, 6,000 hours?"
00:06:42.319,00:06:44.820,Yeah. I can see why you ruled out math.
00:06:47.907,00:06:50.910,But I don’t think that a parent can just force that.
00:06:57.000,00:07:01.128,"Besides, Luke already is the best at something– being my son."
00:07:03.340,00:07:06.842,It sounded a lot less lame in my head.
00:07:06.926,00:07:08.928,I have got a good feeling about this.
00:07:09.012,00:07:10.930,This is gonna be your sport.
00:07:11.014,00:07:13.641,"Last year, you said basketball was my sport."
00:07:13.725,00:07:16.936,"Look, I’ve said a lot of things I wish I could take back but I can’t."
00:07:17.020,00:07:18.938,What I can do...
00:07:19.022,00:07:23.776,is be the dad you need me to be to help you become masterful.
00:07:23.860,00:07:26.404,You wanna be masterful?
00:07:26.488,00:07:28.656,There’s my killer! Okay.
00:07:28.740,00:07:31.826,"Our journey of 10,000 hours..."
00:07:31.910,00:07:35.162,begins with a single pitch.
00:07:35.246,00:07:37.290,I believe in my boy.
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.333,I ain’t gonna quit you.
00:07:39.417,00:07:41.335,Let’s burn one in here.
00:07:41.419,00:07:43.796,That’s good. That’s a good start.
00:07:43.880,00:07:48.968,"Okay, you rest that cannon while I run this down, okay?"
00:07:49.052,00:07:52.471,"Okay, let’s keep all the batters right here."
00:07:52.555,00:07:56.183,"Oh, should’ve– should’ve worn my cup. Should’ve worn my cup."
00:07:56.267,00:07:58.060,Home run!
00:07:58.144,00:08:00.230,"This one’s really in here, buddy."
00:08:05.151,00:08:08.654,"Okay. Very, very, very, very good first hour."
00:08:08.738,00:08:11.241,Toss me your glove. I’ll put some oil on it.
00:08:13.284,00:08:15.202,Yeah.
00:08:15.286,00:08:18.331,"¡Ay, abuela, es que lo que yo te diga es poco!"
00:08:18.415,00:08:20.541,Esto hubiera sido la locura en Barranquilla.
00:08:20.625,00:08:23.252,"No, es que tú no sabes. ¡Mejor que su padre!"
00:08:23.336,00:08:25.630,"Bueno, hasta luego, porque aquí ya llegó Jay. Adiós."
00:08:25.714,00:08:27.506,Everything okay?
00:08:27.590,00:08:29.925,I was telling my grandmother how great was Manny today.
00:08:30.009,00:08:33.512,So that wasn’t angry talk?
00:08:33.596,00:08:36.515,I’m beginning to understand why there’s so much conflict on your continent.
00:08:36.599,00:08:38.768,Here. Check this out.
00:08:42.313,00:08:45.858,Jay loves to make T-shirts for special occasions.
00:08:47.944,00:08:52.699,"A few years back, my granddaughter Haley ran a 5K, so I had a few of these made up."
00:08:53.700,00:08:56.535,It’s just fun.
00:08:56.619,00:09:00.081,I love it when you’re so proud of Manny.
00:09:00.165,00:09:04.710,"Seeing him out there slicing those kids to pieces, you know, it gets to ya."
00:09:04.794,00:09:07.546,"- Gracias, mi amor. - I’m sorry to interrupt."
00:09:07.630,00:09:10.049,"It’s okay, papi."
00:09:10.133,00:09:12.969,And I have something for you. Here.
00:09:14.804,00:09:16.889,I will not be needing it anymore.
00:09:16.973,00:09:19.809,- But the finals? - I am retired.
00:09:27.025,00:09:29.735,You can’t retire.
00:09:29.819,00:09:33.280,"- It’s just not fun anymore. - Well, that’s probably just butterflies."
00:09:33.364,00:09:35.074,Come on. You’re gonna be fine.
00:09:38.328,00:09:40.204,"Ah, the hell it is."
00:09:44.334,00:09:46.961,I’m not nervous. I just don’t want to fight a girl.
00:09:47.045,00:09:48.963,What?
00:09:49.047,00:09:51.507,Defeating a woman will be a mark on my honor.
00:09:51.591,00:09:54.176,Because men are always so superior to woman?
00:09:54.260,00:09:56.512,"- Uh– - Uh, uh."
00:09:56.596,00:10:00.474,So superior that you cannot even finish your sentence?
00:10:00.558,00:10:02.143,Dude.
00:10:02.227,00:10:12.278,"Manny, you always call yourself the lover of women, but if you don’t compete with this girl, you’re showing me and all the woman that you don’t respect us."
00:10:12.362,00:10:14.363,I’m sorry.
00:10:14.447,00:10:16.824,"Okay, so, take back your sword..."
00:10:16.908,00:10:20.161,- and go fight this girl like a bull. - Okay.
00:10:20.245,00:10:22.163,Can’t hear you!
00:10:22.247,00:10:25.667,- I can’t hear you! - That’s really as loud as I can go.
00:10:27.669,00:10:30.296,What does it take to make a great salesman? It’s no big secret.
00:10:30.380,00:10:33.966,You just follow the ABC’s of salesmanship– Always Be Closing.
00:10:34.050,00:10:37.636,"Don’t Ever Forget Great Home Ideas Just Keep Lurking, Mostly Nearby."
00:10:37.720,00:10:40.139,Often People Question Realtors’ Sincerity.
00:10:40.223,00:10:48.898,"Take Umbrage. Violators Will– Oh, shoot. X– X– And this is the great room, although great hardly seems to do a room like this justice."
00:10:48.982,00:10:51.233,"Weird, squiggly painting not included."
00:10:51.317,00:10:53.819,I actually love it.
00:10:59.617,00:11:02.495,Did I need the sale? Yes. Was I worried? No.
00:11:02.579,00:11:04.747,Why? Because. Because why?
00:11:04.831,00:11:08.167,Because I won’t sell anything I don’t believe in.
00:11:08.251,00:11:12.713,"And when I believe, you believe."
00:11:12.797,00:11:14.840,I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo.
00:11:14.924,00:11:17.009,"Yeah, Phil, I’m sorry. It’s a beautiful house."
00:11:17.093,00:11:20.679,"But I’m just not sure how kid-friendly it is, and we have two small children."
00:11:20.763,00:11:22.723,"I mean, these stairs alone– Dad, this place is awesome."
00:11:22.807,00:11:26.560,"Not now, Luke."
00:11:26.644,00:11:30.856,And the bedroom’s got a window on the ceiling. I wish we could live here.
00:11:30.940,00:11:34.235,- I wish you’d go back out to the patio where– - Do you really?
00:11:34.319,00:11:37.947,"Oh, yeah. Our house sucks compared to this one."
00:11:38.031,00:11:40.992,- Hmm. - It really does.
00:11:45.455,00:11:47.915,"I’m gonna get changed and then we’ll go back to Manny’s match, okay?"
00:11:47.999,00:11:51.085,Dad doesn’t want me to go.
00:11:51.169,00:11:53.921,Remember when you were all worried that our son’s a dud?
00:11:54.005,00:11:56.048,Okay. That’s not exactly the way I remember it.
00:11:58.217,00:12:01.304,At what?
00:12:02.472,00:12:04.682,"Hey, titans of residential real estate."
00:12:04.766,00:12:09.895,"That’s right, I’m talking to you, Sandy Brewster, Skip Woosnum, J.J. McCubbin."
00:12:09.979,00:12:15.068,"Hear those footsteps? That’s Luke Dunphy, and he’s gonna drink your milk shake."
00:12:16.653,00:12:18.237,That’s amazing.
00:12:18.321,00:12:19.947,Right?
00:12:20.031,00:12:22.908,"So, the buyer’s coming back in an hour with her husband, and I need him."
00:12:22.992,00:12:24.743,"I am telling you, that kid is a genius."
00:12:24.827,00:12:27.121,There’s the rainmaker.
00:12:27.205,00:12:30.791,- Why is your iPod in your mouth? - I’m charging it.
00:12:30.875,00:12:34.295,Alex. Alex!
00:12:38.841,00:12:42.094,"So, there’s no part of you that wants to clear the air with your sister?"
00:12:42.178,00:12:44.763,Nope.
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.433,"But you should know, it’s hard on the people who love you."
00:12:47.517,00:12:51.395,Cam– We feel the tension. We hear the words that cut like knives.
00:12:51.479,00:12:54.023,"Hey, guys! I brought orange slices."
00:12:54.107,00:12:56.025,"Okay, you know what? I can’t bear this."
00:12:56.109,00:13:00.321,"Claire, Mitchell still resents you for quitting the figure skating team when you were kids."
00:13:04.033,00:13:06.744,"Thanks, Cam."
00:13:06.828,00:13:11.457,"Is that what your little jab was about this morning? Okay. No. Yes. Okay, yes. Yes."
00:13:11.541,00:13:15.294,"I guess I’m still a little angry. But, you know, you stole my moment, Claire."
00:13:17.380,00:13:19.298,because you had your own moments.
00:13:19.382,00:13:22.760,You had cheerleading and high school plays and making out with the quarterback.
00:13:22.844,00:13:26.222,You made out with him too.
00:13:27.890,00:13:31.018,You shouldn’t have quit. It was selfish.
00:13:31.102,00:13:34.146,I quit to protect you.
00:13:34.230,00:13:37.816,Glory? Fame? Press conferences? What?
00:13:37.900,00:13:40.694,"I was bigger than you, and I was afraid you wouldn’t be able to lift me."
00:13:40.778,00:13:42.529,You were dropping me in practice– I dropped you twice.
00:13:42.613,00:13:45.032,and I didn’t want you to humiliate yourself in front of all those people.
00:13:45.116,00:13:49.745,Three times.
00:13:49.829,00:13:55.084,Come on. Could you just forgive me and move on?
00:13:56.669,00:14:00.172,"Of course. Yes, yes. Yes, of– I’m sorry. I’m sorry."
00:14:00.256,00:14:03.217,"Oh. This must seem so petty, huh?"
00:14:03.301,00:14:06.637,"Well, it’s a little silly, but we all have our thing, don’t we?"
00:14:06.721,00:14:09.098,I’m just glad you’re getting it out of you.
00:14:09.182,00:14:13.269,Are you trying to lift me? You are. You’re trying to lift me. Oh!
00:14:18.316,00:14:22.152,"Stay focused, stay loose and stay angry."
00:14:22.236,00:14:25.197,Who’s the toughest?
00:14:25.281,00:14:28.534,Who’s the bravest?
00:14:28.618,00:14:30.202,Who’s the baddest?
00:14:30.286,00:14:33.706,Can you guys ask all the questions now so I don’t have to keep lifting this?
00:14:33.790,00:14:36.458,Go.
00:14:38.544,00:14:40.963,"Okay, go get ’em. Good luck."
00:14:41.047,00:14:43.257,Excuse me. Is this seat taken?
00:14:43.341,00:14:45.384,"Oh, thank you."
00:14:45.468,00:14:47.928,"Oh, is Manny yours?"
00:14:48.012,00:14:50.264,"Oh, he’s quite good. I saw him earlier."
00:14:50.348,00:14:51.932,Thank you.
00:14:52.016,00:14:54.101,"Is she your little girl? Oh, Caroline? No. No."
00:14:54.185,00:14:56.437,"Sadly, her parents passed away."
00:14:56.521,00:14:58.856,I’m her nurse down at the children’s hospital.
00:15:09.992,00:15:16.665,"Yeah. I can talk about crown moldings and recessed lighting until the cows come home, but nothing compares with that sound right there."
00:15:19.085,00:15:22.337,"Oh. Hey, buddy. Oh, he’s fine. Ow."
00:15:24.173,00:15:26.258,It’s not backwards.
00:15:29.178,00:15:30.929,Oak. Also known as nature’s pillow.
00:15:31.013,00:15:34.516,It’s like ice.
00:15:34.600,00:15:37.270,You shouldn’t have been running.
00:15:43.526,00:15:45.444,That’s acting like a natural shoehorn.
00:15:45.528,00:15:49.948,Okay. Probably better all take our shoes off for this part of the tour. Follow me.
00:15:50.032,00:15:52.201,She’s our little miracle.
00:15:52.285,00:15:57.998,Oh. I only wish her father had made it back from Afghanistan to see this.
00:15:58.082,00:16:00.918,"Oh, there’s our cheering section."
00:16:01.002,00:16:03.379,"Over here, you guys."
00:16:07.633,00:16:09.802,"Oh, my God. We have to stop him."
00:16:17.894,00:16:19.812,Maybe I can pull the fire alarm.
00:16:23.232,00:16:25.568,"Bring it on, big boy."
00:16:30.573,00:16:34.952,I just– It would have been nice to see him that proud of us.
00:16:36.370,00:16:39.164,"By us, I mean me."
00:16:39.248,00:16:41.917,And you sincerely thought that the path to Dad’s approval...
00:16:42.001,00:16:43.919,was going to be through figure skating?
00:16:44.003,00:16:47.047,"Mitchell, I am fairly confident that Dad’s proudest moment..."
00:16:47.131,00:16:49.424,was when you finally took off the flame-red unitard.
00:16:49.508,00:16:52.303,I am not claiming that any of this is rational.
00:16:54.764,00:16:58.517,"I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry for being such a pill, okay?"
00:16:59.769,00:17:04.022,"Um, actually, I always felt very guilty for quitting."
00:17:04.106,00:17:06.108,I know how much you loved figure skating.
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.112,I never really loved skating.
00:17:11.113,00:17:13.031,"Uh, what?"
00:17:13.115,00:17:15.784,"Um, all right, this is gonna sound a little gay."
00:17:15.868,00:17:22.374,"But, um, when-when you and I skated together, you weren’t the mean older sister and I wasn’t the clingy little brother."
00:17:22.458,00:17:27.379,"We were– We were a team, and– Well, let’s face it, we’ve kind of grown apart in the past few years."
00:17:27.463,00:17:30.716,"And with Mom and Dad’s divorce, we were on opposing sides."
00:17:30.800,00:17:34.804,And I– I just– I miss being on your team.
00:17:40.101,00:17:42.103,That’s...
00:17:44.855,00:17:47.525,a little gay.
00:17:51.153,00:17:53.488,"Claire, where are you going?"
00:17:53.572,00:17:55.782,Claire?
00:17:55.866,00:17:57.826,No way.
00:17:57.910,00:17:59.828,Get up.
00:17:59.912,00:18:01.830,Really?
00:18:06.669,00:18:08.921,Don’t drop me.
00:18:19.724,00:18:22.809,Put it away or lose it.
00:18:28.649,00:18:30.818,Somebody’s got to put a stop to this.
00:18:35.698,00:18:37.658,"That’s it, Mitchell."
00:18:47.001,00:18:50.128,"So, can we take you and Caroline out for ice cream?"
00:18:50.212,00:18:52.923,We can’t. She’s diabetic.
00:18:53.007,00:18:54.675,Of course she is.
00:18:59.472,00:19:02.599,Let’s get out of here. Get this thing in the trunk.
00:19:02.683,00:19:06.979,I can’t decide if I’m feeling more proud or mortified.
00:19:20.618,00:19:22.369,but let’s be honest.
00:19:22.453,00:19:25.664,Winning feels pretty great.
00:19:25.748,00:19:29.418,There’s nothing like that golden moment in the sun.
00:19:31.754,00:19:34.757,I think every parent probably wants that for their child.
00:19:36.258,00:19:38.928,And maybe a little bit for ourselves too.
00:19:40.096,00:19:43.265,Sometimes we push too hard.
00:19:43.349,00:19:48.395,And that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt.
00:19:48.479,00:19:52.107,"So, how much is too much? Here’s where I come out."
00:19:52.191,00:19:54.401,Guilt fades.
00:19:54.485,00:19:57.488,Hardware is forever.
00:20:07.164,00:20:09.082,"You’re mad, aren’t you?"
00:20:09.166,00:20:11.084,"Yes, you are."
00:20:11.168,00:20:14.087,You’re a little jealous.
00:20:14.171,00:20:16.965,"All right, come on. We’ll do one. Stay there."
00:20:17.049,00:20:19.051,For real?
00:20:28.477,00:20:30.896,Feel better?
00:20:33.315,00:20:35.484,Are you serious?
00:00:03.003,00:00:05.964,Ah– Fix that step.
00:00:14.097,00:00:16.391,Happy anniversary.
00:00:16.475,00:00:19.269,And they said we wouldn’t last.
00:00:19.353,00:00:22.939,Who said that?
00:00:23.023,00:00:24.941,Go ahead. Open it.
00:00:28.278,00:00:30.739,It’s a View-Master.
00:00:31.949,00:00:33.867,"Oh, it’s us."
00:00:36.286,00:00:38.788,"Oh, God, that perm."
00:00:38.872,00:00:40.832,"Yeah, it really framed my face."
00:00:40.916,00:00:44.252,Why is there a picture of a bracelet?
00:00:44.336,00:00:46.713,Huh. Must be some kind of a mistake.
00:00:48.799,00:00:50.884,What did he– did he?
00:00:55.013,00:00:57.307,"Okay, your turn."
00:00:57.391,00:00:59.309,It’s on the bureau.
00:00:59.393,00:01:01.395,I’m surprised I didn’t see it.
00:01:02.562,00:01:05.356,Where?
00:01:09.820,00:01:14.365,I am so excited.
00:01:14.449,00:01:18.453,Hey. Coupons for...
00:01:18.537,00:01:21.122,five free hugs.
00:01:21.206,00:01:23.583,- You don’t like it? - Are you kidding me? I love it.
00:01:27.087,00:01:29.422,"But this makes it official, which is so great."
00:01:29.506,00:01:31.633,I was so proud of myself when I thought of it...
00:01:33.844,00:01:36.387,You never want anything.
00:01:44.187,00:01:46.189,"I love my wife, but she sucks at giving gifts."
00:01:46.273,00:01:49.275,"I’m sorry for the pay-channel language, but– Oh, yogurt maker."
00:01:49.359,00:01:51.028,I can’t not think of things I want.
00:02:07.127,00:02:09.254,I can’t tell if she needs a diaper change.
00:02:09.338,00:02:12.006,I’d think we’d be able to tell.
00:02:12.090,00:02:15.134,Triple leakage protection.
00:02:15.218,00:02:17.262,No gapping or chapping.
00:02:17.346,00:02:20.974,"Cam, do you think that maybe we need a– Night out."
00:02:21.058,00:02:23.393,Yeah. Yes.
00:02:21.058,00:02:25.895,"Just a few hours with a couple of adults, few drinks, no baby talk."
00:02:25.979,00:02:28.940,It’ll make us better parents.
00:02:29.024,00:02:31.150,We’ll get Gloria to babysit. We’re going out.
00:02:31.234,00:02:34.320,You got some spittle.
00:02:34.404,00:02:36.322,Sal.
00:02:38.742,00:02:40.535,We’re calling Sal.
00:02:40.619,00:02:43.037,Sal is our very best friend in the whole wide world.
00:02:43.121,00:02:44.831,The reason we love her so much...
00:02:44.915,00:02:47.667,is she has absolutely no inhibitions.
00:02:50.337,00:02:52.922,is like an Amsterdam Saturday night every day of the week.
00:02:53.006,00:02:59.012,"And, ironically, Sal’s not allowed back into Amsterdam."
00:03:01.848,00:03:04.225,All the other cousins are sleeping over tonight.
00:03:08.021,00:03:09.897,Is Haley still coming?
00:03:09.981,00:03:13.860,You’re related. I will spray you with the hose.
00:03:15.529,00:03:19.032,All the grandkids are coming over for Jay’s Night. Family tradition.
00:03:19.116,00:03:21.701,"Everybody wears p.j.’s, which they love."
00:03:21.785,00:03:24.495,"I make my famous sloppy jays, which are really sloppy joes..."
00:03:24.579,00:03:27.373,"but made by Jay, which they love."
00:03:27.457,00:03:32.587,"And then we all watch a Western together, which they don’t really care for, but hey, it’s Jay’s Night."
00:03:32.671,00:03:37.216,"So, Mom, there’s a party tonight at Andrew Adler’s, and everybody’s gonna be there."
00:03:37.300,00:03:39.761,"Ooh, that sounds like so much fun, but I have other plans."
00:03:39.845,00:03:43.264,"Oh, that’s hi-larious. But I’m talking about me."
00:03:43.348,00:03:46.476,That’s unusual.
00:03:46.560,00:03:48.895,"See, that’s what’s so perfect about this."
00:03:48.979,00:03:50.897,"Andrew only lives, like, a couple blocks away from Grandpa’s."
00:03:50.981,00:03:53.608,"- So I figured that I could go– - Sweetie, you made a commitment."
00:03:53.692,00:03:59.489,"But I really want to go. Plus, every time I go over to Grandpa’s, Manny just stares at me the whole time."
00:03:59.573,00:04:02.241,- Maybe if you wore a bra– - Alex.
00:04:02.325,00:04:04.577,What? I can’t wait to go to Grandpa’s.
00:04:09.166,00:04:11.417,No. Because I love Grandpa.
00:04:11.501,00:04:13.503,And he’s getting older.
00:04:13.587,00:04:15.922,Who knows how many years he has left?
00:04:16.006,00:04:18.800,Is Grandpa dying?
00:04:18.884,00:04:20.843,"Alex, stop torturing your brother."
00:04:20.927,00:04:23.513,No. Your grandfather is fine.
00:04:29.144,00:04:31.563,You expecting someone special?
00:04:39.154,00:04:41.906,Flowers too?
00:04:41.990,00:04:44.534,"Oh, what are you apologizing for? They’re gorgeous."
00:04:44.618,00:04:47.995,That’s too much. With the View-Master and the bracelet...
00:04:48.079,00:04:52.208,and the flowers and the balloons– Balloons?
00:04:52.292,00:04:54.544,I just don’t want you to feel bad...
00:04:54.628,00:04:56.796,about your little... coupons.
00:04:56.880,00:05:00.299,Wait a minute. You– You thought the coupons were your only present?
00:05:00.383,00:05:02.385,Are you kidding me?
00:05:02.469,00:05:06.347,"No! Oh, Phil, come on. It’s our anniversary."
00:05:06.431,00:05:09.725,"Those coupons were just, like, a fun little way to kick off the day."
00:05:13.480,00:05:15.022,Love it.
00:05:15.106,00:05:17.400,Cool.
00:05:17.484,00:05:19.402,I got nothing.
00:05:19.486,00:05:21.530,I’m so screwed.
00:05:22.739,00:05:25.867,"Oh, this place brings back so many memories."
00:05:25.951,00:05:27.994,"- Oh, my God! - Sal!"
00:05:28.078,00:05:32.081,Get up! Get up! Get in here! Big bear!
00:05:32.165,00:05:34.333,"Oh, my baby cub!"
00:05:34.417,00:05:37.086,"Oh, my God."
00:05:37.170,00:05:40.173,"- Oh! You guys notice anything different? - Your hair’s longer, right?"
00:05:40.257,00:05:42.175,No.
00:05:42.259,00:05:44.844,No. Let me give you a little hint. Ba-boobs!
00:05:44.928,00:05:47.680,"Oh, my God."
00:05:47.764,00:05:50.016,"I know, right? You wanna touch ’em?"
00:05:50.100,00:05:52.685,"I’m gay, not dead. Are you okay with this?"
00:05:52.769,00:05:54.812,Yeah. You’re drinking a passion-fruit daiquiri. I’ll be fine.
00:05:54.896,00:05:56.398,"Okay, get in there."
00:06:05.991,00:06:09.076,"So, Lily likes that, that... singing?"
00:06:09.160,00:06:12.371,"- Yes. It relaxes her. - Oh, okay."
00:06:17.711,00:06:19.629,So Lily’s deaf.
00:06:23.717,00:06:25.384,"Hi, Grandpa."
00:06:27.012,00:06:28.721,"Hola, hola."
00:06:28.805,00:06:30.556,"Well, hello there, Haley."
00:06:30.640,00:06:33.226,"Take it down a notch, Jethro."
00:06:33.310,00:06:35.145,"So, you guys ready for some fun?"
00:06:36.104,00:06:37.105,What?
00:06:38.481,00:06:40.983,"I love you, Grandpa, and I’m never gonna forget you."
00:06:41.067,00:06:42.610,"Okay, okay. Back at ya, champ."
00:06:42.694,00:06:46.030,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is a pajama party. Where’s your p.j.’s?"
00:06:46.114,00:06:48.324,"Yeah, they’re in my bag. I need to talk to you about something."
00:06:48.408,00:06:52.703,"- She wants to go to a party with Dylan, Grandpa. - Shut up, Alex."
00:06:52.787,00:06:55.456,It’s at my friend Andrew Adler’s. He lives three blocks from here.
00:06:55.540,00:06:58.042,Oh. Walking distance.
00:07:06.176,00:07:08.844,- Exactly. - I’m glad we agree.
00:07:16.186,00:07:19.021,What?
00:07:19.105,00:07:21.858,"Um, I would be happy to let her change in my room."
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.614,Hmm.
00:07:28.698,00:07:32.326,Who could that be? Are you expecting someone special?
00:07:32.410,00:07:34.954,What did you do?
00:07:35.038,00:07:38.541,Nothing. I just know that there’s someone at the door.
00:07:44.714,00:07:49.635,"- Rock on, Phil Dunphy. - Bam! Read it and weep, Phil."
00:07:49.719,00:07:51.680,Oh.
00:07:56.726,00:08:00.354,Dizzy Dontaine from Spa– Hey.
00:08:00.438,00:08:02.982,He’s got it. He’s just seriously freaking out. Yes!
00:08:03.066,00:08:05.651,Phil loves Spandau Ballet.
00:08:05.735,00:08:08.863,That song True was playing in the car the first time we kissed.
00:08:08.947,00:08:15.161,"It’s our song. So I did some research, found out that the lead guitarist lives, like, 40 miles from here."
00:08:15.245,00:08:17.747,He was in the phone book. How ’80s is that?
00:08:18.748,00:08:20.416,I never liked Spandau Ballet.
00:08:20.500,00:08:22.752,"Our entire marriage, I never once mentioned Spandau Ballet."
00:08:22.836,00:08:24.837,Am I even pronouncing that right?
00:08:24.921,00:08:34.013,"Here to play a private concert for us is the guitarist– Bass player, actually. and lead singer– Well, backup, backup. of Spandau Ballet."
00:08:34.097,00:08:37.516,Between Richard Miller and Martin Kemp.
00:08:43.106,00:08:46.359,I miss you two guys so much.
00:08:46.443,00:08:48.569,"So, so much. To us."
00:08:48.653,00:08:52.240,To us.
00:08:53.241,00:08:55.826,- Cabo! - What?
00:08:55.910,00:08:58.204,"Seriously, you bastards. We’ve been talking about it forever."
00:09:00.957,00:09:04.043,All right. Let’s go.
00:09:04.127,00:09:05.795,Fun? Are you joking?
00:09:08.339,00:09:10.966,It’s gonna be epic.
00:09:11.050,00:09:16.597,"Okay, okay. Um, how much are you gonna pay me to go make out with the waitress?"
00:09:16.681,00:09:19.433,"All right. Now, wait. Which one? The old one or the young one?"
00:09:19.517,00:09:22.311,"- Ooh. - Ten for the young one, 20 for the old."
00:09:24.647,00:09:26.941,I’m just gonna go check on Lily real quick.
00:09:27.025,00:09:31.737,"Well, I’m just– You’re gonna miss me sluttin’ it up with Driving Miss Daisy."
00:09:31.821,00:09:33.239,It’ll just take a second.
00:09:36.659,00:09:39.954,- What? - You should call the baby.
00:09:40.997,00:09:43.290,I love you guys so much.
00:09:43.374,00:09:46.419,Did she just– I’m scared.
00:09:46.503,00:09:49.839,I got nothing.
00:09:49.923,00:09:51.966,"You sure do, honey."
00:09:52.050,00:09:54.760,I don’t think I have anything either.
00:09:54.844,00:09:56.762,Are you kidding me? That’s a straight.
00:09:56.846,00:09:58.723,Really?
00:10:00.517,00:10:02.184,"I win. You got it, Haley."
00:10:02.268,00:10:04.311,You know what? I think I deserve a soda.
00:10:13.905,00:10:15.823,Oh!
00:10:15.907,00:10:17.616,"Gee, you scared me."
00:10:15.907,00:10:21.287,"How did you– Lightbulb went out. You don’t change these right away, you never get around to it."
00:10:21.371,00:10:25.124,There. Now I can see everything that goes on around here.
00:10:28.419,00:10:31.088,Haley wasn’t throwing anything at me I hadn’t seen before...
00:10:31.172,00:10:33.466,from her mother and then some.
00:10:33.550,00:10:35.801,But nobody gets off The Rock.
00:10:35.885,00:10:39.305,Right. Here’s a track. Wasn’t so popular in America.
00:10:39.389,00:10:41.640,Got to number six on the Netherlands charts though.
00:10:41.724,00:10:44.477,That whole summer I couldn’t walk to the corner in Amsterdam...
00:10:44.561,00:10:47.313,without mobs of birds coming up and asking me for the double bubble.
00:10:47.397,00:10:49.440,"Okay, just play it, I think. Yeah."
00:10:49.524,00:10:52.401,"He’s– He’s awesome, honey."
00:10:52.485,00:10:54.236,You’re welcome.
00:11:02.412,00:11:04.538,Oh. Okay.
00:11:04.622,00:11:07.249,"Oh, come on, man. She’s not your sister. Give her a proper snog."
00:11:12.964,00:11:18.219,That’s a bad joke. Not funny. My sister lost her feet to complications from diabetes.
00:11:18.303,00:11:22.890,"Okay. Can I get you some water there, guy, or– - Yeah. - No. You got tea?"
00:11:22.974,00:11:25.226,"Yes, of course. I’ll get that. Chamomile."
00:11:25.310,00:11:28.646,You don’t miss a minute.
00:11:28.730,00:11:32.608,"Oh, God. Why did– You know, look at what I’m doing."
00:11:32.692,00:11:34.860,I’m– I’m making it all about me. What a downer.
00:11:34.944,00:11:36.862,"It’s your evening. Let’s make it great, man."
00:11:36.946,00:11:40.074,"- Name your playlist. I’ll do it all. - Oh, um, just the classics."
00:11:40.158,00:11:42.368,"- Let’s play the hits. - We’ll get to the hits, obviously."
00:11:42.452,00:11:45.120,"Go to the back catalog, man. Favorite B-side."
00:11:45.204,00:11:48.958,"That’s fun. Yeah, that’s fun. Uh, just– I’m so bad with titles."
00:11:55.465,00:12:06.392,That’s why it’s in the noodle. So I guess– - No. What album is that on? - Second. I wanna say second.
00:12:06.476,00:12:10.771,"- What’s on the cover? - There’s a warlock, I think, or a seascape."
00:12:10.855,00:12:12.523,Warlock. Oh. Millennium Sunrise.
00:12:12.607,00:12:14.733,Millennium Sunrise. Right. There is no Millennium Sunrise record.
00:12:14.817,00:12:17.403,What– What? You’re not a Fandau.
00:12:17.487,00:12:20.197,You didn’t even know who I was at the door. I saw it in your eyes.
00:12:20.281,00:12:22.658,Please don’t say anything to Claire. She made a mistake.
00:12:22.742,00:12:24.952,"This means so much to her, and I don’t wanna hurt her feelings."
00:12:25.036,00:12:28.289,"Her feelings? Well, what about my feelings? This is my career, man."
00:12:28.373,00:12:31.083,"You know, my music was the soundtrack to people’s lives."
00:12:31.167,00:12:33.919,Now I’m nothing. How do you think that feels? This is really humiliating.
00:12:34.003,00:12:35.671,"No, no, no. Don’t go. Don’t go."
00:12:35.755,00:12:38.007,Hey. What are you guys doing?
00:12:42.178,00:12:44.305,"Yeah, I think she said kill, Cam. I do."
00:12:44.389,00:12:47.057,Maybe it was just a joke. She’s always had a dark sense of humor.
00:12:47.141,00:12:49.101,That’s true. Remember her Halloween costume?
00:12:49.185,00:12:51.604,When she came as Siegfried and part of Roy.
00:12:51.688,00:12:54.857,It was too soon.
00:12:54.941,00:12:58.485,Yes. Yeah. Here she comes. I’m gonna bring up Lily. We’ll see what she says.
00:12:58.569,00:13:00.696,Show her some pictures.
00:13:00.780,00:13:03.198,Whoa. More drinks.
00:13:03.282,00:13:05.492,- Free drinks. - Wow.
00:13:05.576,00:13:07.953,"Sal, you’ve got to look at these pictures."
00:13:08.037,00:13:10.664,It’s Lily at the zoo.
00:13:10.748,00:13:14.335,Look at that one.
00:13:19.632,00:13:22.134,"Well, you know– Yeah, probably."
00:13:22.218,00:13:24.553,- I will throw her in the ocean. - What?
00:13:24.637,00:13:26.889,I said I gotta go pee.
00:13:26.973,00:13:28.975,"Okay, that wasn’t even close."
00:13:32.061,00:13:36.523,"I mean, what do we do? Do we say something? How do we even bring it up?"
00:13:36.607,00:13:39.401,"She threatened our child, and that’s your concern– a segue?"
00:13:39.485,00:13:41.737,You know what this is?
00:13:41.821,00:13:44.907,This is first-child syndrome.
00:13:52.081,00:13:57.670,"Yes. That’s brilliant, except Sal’s not our child, so– Well, think about it. We’ve practically done everything for her."
00:13:57.754,00:13:59.630,We’ve held her when she’s cried.
00:13:59.714,00:14:02.007,We’ve carried her when she couldn’t walk.
00:14:02.091,00:14:04.551,We’ve done everything but potty-train her.
00:14:04.635,00:14:06.553,Hey.
00:14:06.637,00:14:09.348,- I was thinking– Oh. - Oh. Sorry.
00:14:09.432,00:14:16.605,"When we go to Cabo, we have to find a hotel with a swim-up bar, ’cause this going back and forth to the bathroom is a fool’s game."
00:14:16.689,00:14:19.191,"Okay, let’s get more drinks."
00:14:19.275,00:14:22.361,"- It’s about Lily. - Oh, shocker."
00:14:22.445,00:14:24.446,Okay.
00:14:24.530,00:14:26.865,that maybe– maybe you’re jealous of her?
00:14:26.949,00:14:32.705,It’s just– I don’t know.
00:14:32.789,00:14:34.748,"Well, because you won’t look at any pictures of her..."
00:14:34.832,00:14:37.376,and you talked about killing her and throwing her in the ocean.
00:14:37.460,00:14:40.421,"Okay, that was a joke, you guys. Come on."
00:14:40.505,00:14:42.423,Fine. Show me the pictures of Yoko.
00:14:42.507,00:14:44.216,"See, it’s– Sal."
00:14:44.300,00:14:47.428,"It’s a joke. You guys! Come on. ’Cause she’s Asian, and she broke up our group."
00:14:47.512,00:14:51.724,"I– I just– Look, let’s at least acknowledge that things have changed between us."
00:14:51.808,00:14:55.227,And you know what? Because Lily’s here doesn’t mean we love you any less.
00:14:55.311,00:14:57.396,No. Absolutely not.
00:15:01.484,00:15:08.699,"Well, but we– And last week I had a really bad dream, and I was thinking, Okay, I’m gonna call them."
00:15:08.783,00:15:11.493,"And then I thought, Oh, no, you can’t call them..."
00:15:11.577,00:15:15.414,because you might wake up their baby.
00:15:15.498,00:15:18.208,You can always call.
00:15:18.292,00:15:21.670,"No. I’m sorry we haven’t been there. We’re here now, okay?"
00:15:26.843,00:15:28.719,Feel better?
00:15:35.184,00:15:38.437,Did she just fall asleep?
00:15:38.521,00:15:40.355,Give her eight shots of tequila.
00:15:49.365,00:15:51.534,I have a theory.
00:15:52.618,00:15:55.830,"Manny, why don’t you go fire up some popcorn?"
00:15:57.623,00:16:00.125,You looking for these?
00:16:00.209,00:16:02.795,You took my shoes?
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.798,"Sorry, kid. It ain’t your night."
00:16:05.882,00:16:08.801,"I just wanted to go to that party for, like, two hours."
00:16:08.885,00:16:12.012,I would’ve been back by now. Would that have killed you?
00:16:12.096,00:16:14.181,She’s just like her mother.
00:16:14.265,00:16:16.266,Why are you treating Haley like this?
00:16:16.350,00:16:18.435,Me? She’s the one acting like a pill.
00:16:18.519,00:16:20.479,You’re taking this too personally.
00:16:20.563,00:16:25.859,"When I was Haley’s age, I loved my grandfather, but I still wanted to go to parties and be with boys."
00:16:25.943,00:16:29.196,I know. I know. So did Claire... and Mitchell.
00:16:29.280,00:16:32.908,"But you know what? You try to put something over on me, you’re gonna lose."
00:16:35.745,00:16:38.831,"I’m trying to keep ’em around a little bit longer, that’s all."
00:16:38.915,00:16:42.877,"I mean, who knows how many nights like this I got left?"
00:16:44.754,00:16:48.340,I miss you already.
00:16:48.424,00:16:52.177,"Go in the kitchen and help out the guys, and I’ll be right in."
00:16:52.261,00:16:58.100,"It’s great that you wanna spend time with your granddaughter, but is this really the way?"
00:16:59.435,00:17:02.771,Fine.
00:17:08.527,00:17:10.446,Dylan!
00:17:14.367,00:17:17.286,"You’re here to take Haley to the party, right?"
00:17:17.370,00:17:20.164,Yeah.
00:17:21.832,00:17:24.334,How did you know I was here?
00:17:24.418,00:17:26.629,This is how I first met Phil.
00:17:29.966,00:17:32.384,"Thanks again, Grandpa. We’ll be back by 11:00."
00:17:32.468,00:17:34.887,- I will track you down. - I believe that.
00:17:37.848,00:17:42.519,There’s plenty left.
00:17:42.603,00:17:44.521,Right on.
00:17:44.605,00:17:46.899,Can’t believe she’s into this guy.
00:17:46.983,00:17:48.734,"If you want, I’ll fix you a plate."
00:17:48.818,00:17:51.653,"Yeah, definitely. That’d be great."
00:17:51.737,00:17:57.743,"We can go in just a minute. Just let– Oh, no way. The Gunfighter. I love this movie."
00:17:59.912,00:18:02.748,Oh. But... cowboys.
00:18:02.832,00:18:05.417,"Don’t fight it, Haley. They never grow up."
00:18:05.501,00:18:07.669,Thanks.
00:18:12.341,00:18:14.426,"Two, three, four."
00:18:18.639,00:18:20.933,The year was 1991.
00:18:21.017,00:18:23.435,America was immersed in Desert Storm.
00:18:26.522,00:18:30.442,"Meanwhile, stateside, another storm was brewing..."
00:18:30.526,00:18:32.653,in my heart.
00:18:32.737,00:18:34.655,"This is stupid, isn’t it? This is– No."
00:18:34.739,00:18:38.742,"- Is it stupid, Phil? - No. Just keep– keep going, Claire."
00:18:38.826,00:18:40.911,- It’s wonderful. - Okay.
00:18:40.995,00:18:48.085,"After a romantic dinner at Fratelli’s, a certain nervous young couple shared their first kiss..."
00:18:48.169,00:18:51.881,as the radio played this song.
00:19:18.824,00:19:20.492,Yes. Yes.
00:19:20.576,00:19:22.828,- What’s going on? - Do you even know the name of this song?
00:19:22.912,00:19:25.163,P– True.
00:19:25.247,00:19:26.999,True.
00:19:27.083,00:19:28.917,Right. This is false. See?
00:19:29.001,00:19:30.919,I’m not gonna play True for someone who’s false.
00:19:31.003,00:19:33.005,"See, he doesn’t– He doesn’t even know the band."
00:19:33.089,00:19:35.465,"He’s not a fan, a Fandau."
00:19:35.549,00:19:38.552,’Cause this is our song. You love this song. Tell him this is our song.
00:19:38.636,00:19:41.638,"- Right. Tell him, Phil. - It’s not our song, Claire."
00:19:41.722,00:19:44.349,Our song is If You Leave by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.
00:19:46.602,00:19:49.354,Pretty sure. I sang it at our wedding.
00:19:51.399,00:19:54.192,"Well, actually, he’s the idiot. He fell in love to a break-up song."
00:19:54.276,00:19:58.071,Ignore him. This is beautiful. I love it.
00:19:58.155,00:20:00.907,"You’re so sweet and nice, and I can’t even give you..."
00:20:00.991,00:20:02.951,a decent anniversary present.
00:20:03.035,00:20:06.288,"I love you so much, and I feel you just are never gonna know it."
00:20:06.372,00:20:09.875,I know it. I know it. Yes.
00:20:09.959,00:20:13.378,You do?
00:20:13.462,00:20:15.380,You know why?
00:20:15.464,00:20:17.883,You just gave us a new song.
00:20:17.967,00:20:20.385,"Sort of brought you back together, eh?"
00:20:20.469,00:20:22.095,Seems.
00:20:22.179,00:20:25.599,Rekindled fires of a dying passion?
00:20:29.061,00:20:30.979,"All right, buddy."
00:20:31.063,00:20:33.440,"For you, Claire."
00:20:55.796,00:20:59.007,I knew Mr. Frazzlebottom wasn’t gonna pass up a free one.
00:20:59.091,00:21:02.427,She is so sweet.
00:21:02.511,00:21:04.888,Like a little angel.
00:21:04.972,00:21:06.891,Let me hold her.
00:21:10.436,00:21:13.105,"Oh, thank God."
00:00:11.345,00:00:06.673,a few days earlier earlier that day one hour earlier Do we know anything?
00:00:06.757,00:00:09.259,We’re lucky though. The paramedics said it could have been a lot worse.
00:00:09.343,00:00:11.261,"My God, how did this even happen?"
00:00:11.345,00:00:16.516,a few days earlier There he is. Big day’s coming up.
00:00:16.600,00:00:19.227,"- What do you want for your birthday, big dog? - It’s okay. I’m good."
00:00:24.191,00:00:26.776,"- Well, I guess I could use a belt. - A belt?"
00:00:26.860,00:00:29.154,"Yeah, you’re right. I don’t need it."
00:00:29.238,00:00:31.614,Extension cord works pretty good.
00:00:34.159,00:00:38.746,"Every year, Luke’s birthday falls right around Thanksgiving, and so it gets lost in the holiday shuffle."
00:00:38.830,00:00:41.708,"One year we forgot completely, and we had to improvise a cake of stuffing."
00:00:41.792,00:00:47.172,"Which, by the way, he was fine with. He’s one of those kids, you get him a gift and all he wants to do is play with the box."
00:00:47.256,00:00:50.175,"Yeah, one year we actually just got him a box, a really nice box."
00:00:50.259,00:00:52.969,And we made the mistake of putting it in a gift bag.
00:00:53.053,00:00:55.346,So he played with the gift bag.
00:00:55.430,00:00:57.390,We can’t get it right.
00:00:57.474,00:01:00.059,"- I feel terrible. We gotta do something. - Oh, yeah."
00:01:00.143,00:01:03.104,"Um, well, you know, the family is gonna be together for Thanksgiving..."
00:01:03.188,00:01:05.106,for the first time in I don’t even know how long.
00:01:05.190,00:01:07.108,I am so with you. We should blow this out...
00:01:07.192,00:01:09.152,and throw Luke the best birthday party of all time.
00:01:09.236,00:01:11.154,Yes. Yes. And we’ll order a whole bunch of pizzas...
00:01:11.238,00:01:13.156,and set up an arts and crafts table.
00:01:13.240,00:01:15.158,- A what? - A crafts table.
00:01:15.242,00:01:18.494,"You know, where everybody gathers around and they make stuff, and then bam!"
00:01:20.455,00:01:22.999,Sorry. I fell asleep while you were describing the most boring party ever.
00:01:24.334,00:01:25.335,Ow!
00:01:39.683,00:01:42.769,See you in a few hours.
00:01:42.853,00:01:45.188,- I’ll get it back to you right after the party. - That’d be great.
00:01:45.272,00:01:48.566,Okay.
00:01:48.650,00:01:50.985,"Hey, Phil. Are, uh, you getting a clown for today?"
00:01:51.069,00:01:55.698,"Oh, no. Luke’s not much of a clown fan."
00:01:55.782,00:01:57.450,- Really? - Yeah. He never liked ’em.
00:02:01.455,00:02:03.331,"Really. So anyway, thanks again."
00:02:03.415,00:02:05.751,Okay. Yep. See you later.
00:02:06.793,00:02:09.712,- No clown? No– No clown? - Let it go.
00:02:09.796,00:02:11.965,Who throws a party without a clown?
00:02:12.049,00:02:14.133,"Since the late ’30s, I’d say most people."
00:02:14.217,00:02:16.719,You know what? We haven’t gotten Luke a present yet.
00:02:16.803,00:02:19.180,- Maybe a clown could be our present. - Cameron. Cameron.
00:02:19.264,00:02:21.933,"If Phil and Claire wanted to get Luke a clown, they would’ve."
00:02:22.017,00:02:24.227,This is not our party.
00:02:22.017,00:02:27.188,But– This is not our party.
00:02:24.311,00:02:30.608,"But I just– Fine. What would you suggest we get him then, hmm?"
00:02:30.692,00:02:32.819,Get him a gift card.
00:02:32.903,00:02:35.321,A gift card?
00:02:35.405,00:02:37.699,Who hurt you?
00:02:40.285,00:02:43.705,"Hey, Gloria, you got any idea how to wrap one of these things?"
00:02:47.751,00:02:49.627,We can’t give Luke a crossbow.
00:02:49.711,00:02:51.170,He pokes himself in the eye...
00:02:51.254,00:02:52.755,every time he uses a straw.
00:02:54.925,00:02:57.176,My dad used to give me a quarter for every crow I bagged.
00:02:57.260,00:02:59.846,And I used to have a machete. But times have changed.
00:02:59.930,00:03:02.682,It’ll be fine. I’ll teach him how to use it.
00:03:02.766,00:03:04.684,"Hey, pal, how’s it going?"
00:03:04.768,00:03:07.061,"- Oh, boy. - Of course you’re charming."
00:03:07.145,00:03:09.188,- Who said you were not charming? - No one.
00:03:09.272,00:03:11.733,"But there’s a girl in my school, and I want her to like me."
00:03:11.817,00:03:14.444,"- I need your advice, Jay. - Really?"
00:03:14.528,00:03:19.198,"- She’s gonna be at Luke’s party. - Well, I’m a little thrown."
00:03:19.282,00:03:21.909,"I mean, you don’t usually come to me for advice."
00:03:21.993,00:03:24.454,"Well, this is one area in which you’ve done pretty well."
00:03:24.538,00:03:26.914,He has a point.
00:03:26.998,00:03:32.086,"I’ve tried everything to get her attention– opening doors, having a milk sent over in the cafeteria."
00:03:32.170,00:03:34.088,Nothing’s worked.
00:03:36.466,00:03:38.384,They go for power and success.
00:03:38.468,00:03:42.139,"And since you don’t have either one of those things, you’re gonna be the funny guy."
00:03:47.227,00:03:49.395,I have an iguana that eats crickets.
00:03:49.479,00:03:52.482,That’d be scary if it was a birthday party for crickets.
00:03:52.566,00:03:55.777,"Seriously, Jungle Tanya, I need you step it up a notch."
00:03:55.861,00:03:57.945,Is there anything that scares the cocoa out of you?
00:03:58.029,00:04:01.240,"Uh, not really. I do have a bearded dragon."
00:04:01.324,00:04:04.118,"Ooh. Does it– No, it does not breathe fire."
00:04:04.202,00:04:06.287,"Well, then we’re back to square one, aren’t we?"
00:04:08.665,00:04:11.501,I couldn’t get Luke out of my mind.
00:04:11.585,00:04:17.340,"I know I made a promise to Mitchell, but some things are bigger than promises."
00:04:18.341,00:04:21.511,Fizbo would be at that party.
00:04:32.856,00:04:34.524,It all happened so fast.
00:04:36.693,00:04:39.529,"No, don’t blame yourself. Who could’ve possibly seen it coming?"
00:04:39.613,00:04:44.951,"earlier that day Oh, my God."
00:04:45.035,00:04:47.787,"Hey, has anyone ever gotten hurt on one of these things?"
00:04:47.871,00:04:49.789,"I don’t know, man. It’s my first day."
00:04:49.873,00:04:53.626,They wouldn’t let the new guy do it if it– That did not make me feel better.
00:04:53.710,00:04:55.711,"I signed, like, a hundred releases."
00:04:55.795,00:04:59.173,When did we decide all this? I think it’s too much.
00:04:59.257,00:05:01.467,"See, I knew you’d say that. That’s why I didn’t tell you."
00:05:01.551,00:05:03.469,So just relax. Grab a snow cone.
00:05:03.553,00:05:05.763,- There’s a snow cone machine? - Yeah.
00:05:05.847,00:05:08.474,"Mom, just so you know, Dylan cannot have mayonnaise."
00:05:08.558,00:05:10.726,That’s random. Why are you telling me that?
00:05:10.810,00:05:13.479,’Cause he’s coming to the party.
00:05:13.563,00:05:16.774,"Yes, because she can’t go 10 minutes without her boyfriend’s tongue in her mouth."
00:05:16.858,00:05:20.153,It’s like he’s feeding a baby bird.
00:05:20.237,00:05:22.155,I’m sure you’ll meet someone super hot at computer camp.
00:05:22.239,00:05:24.824,Girls.
00:05:24.908,00:05:27.577,"- So, what you got there? - Oh. These are supplies for the crafts table."
00:05:27.661,00:05:29.579,I finally figured out what we’re gonna be making.
00:05:32.749,00:05:36.002,It looks good. What is it?
00:05:36.086,00:05:38.004,I know. I know.
00:05:41.174,00:05:49.849,"At first we thought it was really stupid, and then we had a blast, so– How could you not? You combined the two things that kids love the most– combs and sheaths."
00:05:50.892,00:05:52.351,I’m kidding!
00:05:54.437,00:05:58.024,Here it is in my incredibly convenient beaded comb sheath...
00:05:58.108,00:06:00.651,that I made at Luke’s awesome birthday party.
00:06:00.735,00:06:02.695,"Hole in one, Mrs. Dunphy."
00:06:02.779,00:06:05.031,Hole in one.
00:06:05.115,00:06:06.991,I’m home.
00:06:07.075,00:06:09.535,"I got Luke a video game, but it’s about math."
00:06:09.619,00:06:12.789,So I guess we’re those kind of uncles.
00:06:13.915,00:06:15.917,Cam.
00:06:19.212,00:06:21.589,Don’t be mad.
00:06:21.673,00:06:26.302,Oh. Cam. Uh– I’ve known I wanted to be a clown...
00:06:26.386,00:06:28.387,since I found out clowns were just people with makeup.
00:06:28.471,00:06:34.393,"Um, as a matter of fact, by the time I was a teenager, if I wasn’t in school or fishin’, I was clownin’."
00:06:39.482,00:06:42.902,I am a classically trained Auguste clown named Fizbo.
00:06:42.986,00:06:45.029,What?
00:06:45.113,00:06:49.284,"Between the clownin’ and the fishin’, I’m surprised you had time for the schoolin’."
00:06:50.785,00:06:52.995,"Aw, and there’s the fifth type– the sad clown."
00:06:53.079,00:06:57.208,Sad clown is a tramp. So there’s still only four types.
00:07:01.004,00:07:02.922,"Cam, I thought we discussed this."
00:07:03.006,00:07:05.091,We did. But I– I started thinking.
00:07:05.175,00:07:09.637,And this isn’t about you or me. This is about a little boy who deserves some happiness.
00:07:09.721,00:07:12.932,And he’s gonna get that from his weird gay clown uncle?
00:07:13.016,00:07:15.601,Fizbo is not gay. He’s asexual.
00:07:15.685,00:07:17.770,Oh.
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.939,is to bring people joy and laughter and balloon animals.
00:07:22.859,00:07:25.945,"Oh, okay. Well, at least we agree on something. Yeah."
00:07:28.406,00:07:29.908,Oh.
00:07:31.242,00:07:46.382,"If this tape is found in the future, Yeah, there’s my boy. Zip-line extreme– I’m okay. I’m good. I’m good."
00:07:46.466,00:07:49.135,Lesson learned. Don’t stand– Don’t stand there.
00:07:49.219,00:07:53.014,Let’s go ahead and rope this area off. Excellent. Thank you.
00:07:53.098,00:07:55.850,"Hey, buddy, you having fun?"
00:07:55.934,00:07:57.643,Yeah. And I love my new belt.
00:07:59.479,00:08:01.480,Do you wanna make a comb sheath?
00:08:09.739,00:08:13.326,Do you want to?
00:08:13.410,00:08:16.495,"Okay, honey. It’s your day."
00:08:16.579,00:08:18.456,"Honey, let me know if you get low on supplies."
00:08:18.540,00:08:21.292,I’ll make a quick run back to the 1950s for you.
00:08:21.376,00:08:23.878,Oh! Again?
00:08:23.962,00:08:28.090,"Seriously, zip-line guys, use some ropes."
00:08:30.427,00:08:32.803,"Oh, no. I forgot."
00:08:32.887,00:08:35.056,I know. I’m sorry.
00:08:35.140,00:08:37.642,"No, no, no. I’ll do it. You stay right here."
00:08:37.726,00:08:39.644,Relax.
00:08:39.728,00:08:41.854,You’re worried about people seeing me.
00:08:41.938,00:08:46.276,People are gonna stare. They’re not used to seeing one clown in a car.
00:08:48.319,00:08:50.321,That’s her– Bianca Douglas.
00:08:50.405,00:08:52.365,She’s so cute.
00:08:54.617,00:08:57.036,She’s a complete package. Wish me luck.
00:08:57.120,00:09:01.791,"You don’t need luck. You just remember those jokes I told you, hmm?"
00:09:04.294,00:09:06.295,We have to stop meeting like this.
00:09:08.798,00:09:10.883,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:10.967,00:09:12.885,Sure.
00:09:12.969,00:09:16.555,So a grasshopper named Gary walks into a bar. Aw. No.
00:09:16.639,00:09:19.141,"You’re not supposed to know his name. Let me try another one, okay?"
00:09:19.225,00:09:21.310,"Knock, knock."
00:09:21.394,00:09:23.396,Interrupting cow.
00:09:23.480,00:09:26.065,"Moo. Oh, crap."
00:09:35.450,00:09:38.119,"- Um, hey. - Hey yourself."
00:09:38.203,00:09:41.247,- Move. - You kind of just bumped me with your car.
00:09:41.331,00:09:44.166,I don’t think so.
00:09:48.421,00:09:50.256,Okay. I just thought you might wanna know...
00:09:50.340,00:09:55.594,"in case you wanted to be a decent human being and apologize, but– No? Okay."
00:09:55.678,00:09:57.347,Ass.
00:09:58.723,00:10:03.686,"- What did you say? - Just forget about it, all right?"
00:10:05.396,00:10:07.273,"Listen, carrottop. I didn’t touch you."
00:10:05.396,00:10:11.026,"Um, I– So do the smart thing. Shut your hole, get in your car and drive away."
00:10:11.110,00:10:12.778,Is there a problem here?
00:10:12.862,00:10:15.614,- What the hell are you? - I’m the ass-kicking clown...
00:10:15.698,00:10:17.700,that’ll twist you like a balloon animal.
00:10:21.079,00:10:24.582,So apologize to my boyfriend right now!
00:10:24.666,00:10:27.001,Apologize? Boyfriend?
00:10:27.085,00:10:29.211,Okay. I’m sorry.
00:10:34.050,00:10:36.386,Let’s go. We’re gonna be late.
00:10:47.397,00:10:49.023,Mind if I come in?
00:10:49.107,00:10:50.775,Sure.
00:10:51.901,00:10:53.820,Come here.
00:10:54.904,00:10:58.157,Why you bounce so sad?
00:10:58.241,00:11:00.493,It turns out I’m not the funny guy.
00:11:00.577,00:11:06.999,"The right girl will find you when it’s time, even though I’m gonna hate losing you to another woman."
00:11:07.083,00:11:10.711,"You’ll never lose me, Mom. I’ll always love you, no matter what."
00:11:17.093,00:11:20.179,"Just be the sweet, wonderful little boy that you are."
00:11:20.263,00:11:22.973,Sweet little boy. Got it.
00:11:23.057,00:11:25.518,She won’t know what hit her.
00:11:27.312,00:11:29.897,"Hey, Manny, wanna make a sweet comb sheath?"
00:11:29.981,00:11:32.609,"Could not be a worse time, Claire."
00:11:33.943,00:11:37.571,Oh. It’s so peaceful and quiet over here.
00:11:37.655,00:11:40.908,"Ha-ha. If you came over here to gloat, I already know it’s a dud."
00:11:40.992,00:11:43.494,"Actually, I came to give you this."
00:11:43.578,00:11:46.497,It’s your favorite flavor– blue.
00:11:46.581,00:11:48.499,"Thanks, honey."
00:11:48.583,00:11:50.876,And your hair looks really nice.
00:11:50.960,00:11:53.546,I’ve been combing it all day.
00:11:53.630,00:11:58.259,"All right, let’s all give Luke a big hand for being so brave."
00:11:58.343,00:12:01.387,This feels so weird. What does it eat?
00:12:06.309,00:12:09.270,Is there mayo in this?
00:12:09.354,00:12:17.862,"So I was thinking that maybe we could go slip away– - So, does anyone wanna pet the iguana? - Hells, yeah. Oh, man."
00:12:20.657,00:12:23.409,What’s his name?
00:12:23.493,00:12:27.079,Wow. I totally get that.
00:12:27.163,00:12:29.039,You don’t deserve this.
00:12:29.123,00:12:31.584,What?
00:12:31.668,00:12:36.589,"You know, probably has her own apartment, obviously okay touching gross stuff."
00:12:36.673,00:12:38.757,You’re right.
00:12:38.841,00:12:41.260,Dylan’s far too sophisticated to get sucked in...
00:12:41.344,00:12:43.178,by a single lady with tons of cool tattoos.
00:12:46.015,00:12:48.601,"- Oh, no. - No way, Mother Nature."
00:12:48.685,00:12:50.311,I can’t believe he does that.
00:12:53.189,00:12:55.441,"Hey, what am I missing, guys?"
00:12:55.525,00:12:57.443,"Aw, geez, Gloria."
00:12:57.527,00:13:00.529,"Jay, look! I go high! Look! Look!"
00:13:00.613,00:13:04.909,"Guys, hit the road. Come on. You’re family men. Come on. Scat."
00:13:04.993,00:13:06.619,"Great job, buddy."
00:13:06.703,00:13:09.955,Now comes the fun part. Rappel down.
00:13:10.039,00:13:11.957,It’s really high.
00:13:12.041,00:13:16.587,You have nothing to fear but fear itself... and the concrete.
00:13:19.382,00:13:22.927,I am brave. Roller coasters? Love ’em.
00:13:23.011,00:13:25.095,"Scary movies? I’ve seen Ghostbusters, like, seven times."
00:13:25.179,00:13:27.139,I regularly drive through neighborhoods...
00:13:27.223,00:13:29.224,that have only recently been gentrified.
00:13:31.728,00:13:33.604,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody!"
00:13:37.900,00:13:40.402,Except clowns.
00:13:40.486,00:13:42.947,"Never shared that with the fam, so... shh."
00:13:45.074,00:13:47.076,I am not really sure where the fear comes from.
00:13:47.160,00:13:52.998,"My mother says it’s because when I was a kid, I found a dead clown in the woods, but who knows?"
00:13:53.082,00:13:56.502,"Hey. Oh. Well, you must be the birthday boy."
00:14:00.506,00:14:04.176,"I don’t know who this Uncle Cam is, but he sure sounds handsome, doesn’t he?"
00:14:07.597,00:14:11.100,It’s just Cam. It’s just Cam.
00:14:11.184,00:14:16.897,What? Yeah. Just have kind of a complicated relationship with clowns.
00:14:16.981,00:14:19.358,"Well, join the club."
00:14:23.071,00:14:27.032,"Look, I came on strong with that whole funny guy bit."
00:14:27.116,00:14:30.035,This is me just being myself.
00:14:30.119,00:14:32.955,"Okay. Hey, do you know who that boy is over there?"
00:14:33.039,00:14:37.084,Oh. That’s Dylan. He’s Haley’s boyfriend.
00:14:44.383,00:14:47.261,"Pardon me, miss, but this little doggy needs a new home."
00:14:47.345,00:14:49.347,"Oh, thank you."
00:14:51.390,00:14:53.267,That’s quite an impressive getup you got there.
00:14:53.351,00:14:56.896,"Thank you, Jay. Oh, by the way, you have something on your shoulder."
00:15:00.233,00:15:02.401,Never mind. It was nothing.
00:15:02.485,00:15:04.487,We’re done here.
00:15:19.001,00:15:23.589,I only have a cat.
00:15:23.673,00:15:28.510,"I was just messing with you before, but seriously, he’s still talking to her."
00:15:28.594,00:15:31.305,- Wow. Cool. - On it.
00:15:36.185,00:15:38.771,You kind of do look like Britney Spears.
00:15:41.232,00:15:44.485,"- Anyway, this is probably my favorite. - Hey, jungle lady?"
00:15:44.569,00:15:48.614,- I think– I think one of your bugs got out. - What? This one?
00:15:48.698,00:15:50.783,This box thing here– It’s on its side.
00:15:50.867,00:15:53.118,"- Oh, my God. Where did it go? - Is everything okay?"
00:15:53.202,00:15:56.163,"No. I lost a poisonous scorpion, and I need to find it."
00:15:56.247,00:15:59.958,"Okay, kids, let’s all tuck our pants into our socks."
00:16:00.042,00:16:04.213,"Avoid shady, moist places, and let’s make a game of looking where we step."
00:16:11.429,00:16:13.347,Is he okay?
00:16:13.431,00:16:16.517,He’s in with the doctor right now.
00:16:16.601,00:16:19.645,"These things happen, right? No matter how careful you are."
00:16:19.729,00:16:22.815,"one hour earlier Hey, look what Grandpa gave me– a crossbow."
00:16:22.899,00:16:24.817,"Sweetie, that does not look safe."
00:16:24.901,00:16:28.195,He’s gonna show me how to use it. That’s what... I’m afraid of.
00:16:31.991,00:16:34.493,"Oh, my God. You are not making comb sheaths."
00:16:37.246,00:16:39.331,"No. It’s just like, uh, Donna Rigby’s party."
00:16:39.415,00:16:42.501,Exactly! Yes! And I have the beads and everything.
00:16:42.585,00:16:45.003,Amazing. This is awesome.
00:16:45.087,00:16:47.714,So... Cam’s a clown.
00:16:47.798,00:16:49.800,Yeah.
00:16:49.884,00:16:53.053,I totally got you.
00:16:58.768,00:17:02.146,Look at them now. They’re the life of the party.
00:17:02.230,00:17:07.109,"Uh, you know, I gotta say, for all his craziness, I love my clown."
00:17:07.193,00:17:09.695,Me too. They’re good for us.
00:17:09.779,00:17:11.864,I would’ve totally tanked this party.
00:17:11.948,00:17:14.700,And I would’ve gotten my butt kicked at a gas station.
00:17:14.784,00:17:18.537,Sorry?
00:17:26.128,00:17:29.882,"No, no. Too close. Too close. Too close."
00:17:31.801,00:17:33.719,"Oh, crap!"
00:17:33.803,00:17:36.221,We fired the crossbow.
00:17:36.305,00:17:39.976,"No, I know. Oh, my God. It’s right there."
00:17:43.938,00:17:45.940,"Bianca, I’m coming."
00:17:52.989,00:17:56.658,It turns out I’m not the sweet guy or the funny guy.
00:17:56.742,00:17:59.119,"No, Manny, don’t go in! ¡Por favor!"
00:17:59.203,00:18:01.163,I must!
00:18:05.293,00:18:06.752,I’m coming!
00:18:06.836,00:18:09.463,Manny Delgado is a man of action.
00:18:14.176,00:18:16.345,Wait. My dog is still in there.
00:18:31.694,00:18:33.612,Sweetie? Luke?
00:18:33.696,00:18:35.781,"What happened, buddy?"
00:18:35.865,00:18:37.532,"Hey, hey. What happened?"
00:18:37.616,00:18:40.953,- I slipped on these stupid beads. - Oops.
00:18:41.037,00:18:42.538,Come on. Here we go.
00:18:44.248,00:18:45.749,How is he?
00:18:45.833,00:18:47.542,"Oh, he’s gonna be fine."
00:18:55.551,00:18:57.302,Wow. Everybody’s here.
00:18:57.386,00:18:59.388,Of course we are. How’s that busted flipper?
00:18:59.472,00:19:02.849,Okay.
00:19:02.933,00:19:05.435,Are you kidding? This was the best birthday ever.
00:19:05.519,00:19:08.146,What?
00:19:08.230,00:19:10.899,You like a cast? I’ve always wanted one.
00:19:10.983,00:19:13.777,"After a few weeks, they start to smell."
00:19:13.861,00:19:15.821,"You are so weird, you know that?"
00:19:15.905,00:19:17.406,Can I sign it?
00:19:17.490,00:19:19.574,Hey. Me first.
00:19:21.327,00:19:24.162,if I wanted there to be a chain reaction of disasters...
00:19:24.246,00:19:27.624,"that led to Luke breaking his arm, I probably would’ve said no."
00:19:27.708,00:19:32.379,Probably?
00:19:32.463,00:19:39.887,"But, one way or another, Luke was the center of attention on his birthday, and the whole family was together..."
00:19:41.347,00:19:43.432,just the way it should be.
00:19:43.516,00:19:46.685,Fizbo delivery! I brought the cake!
00:19:48.771,00:19:51.606,I can’t do this.
00:19:59.115,00:20:02.159,Cake.
00:20:09.708,00:20:12.669,Bianca Douglas called me three times tonight.
00:20:12.753,00:20:16.048,I’m not gonna lie to you. I’m starting to feel smothered.
00:20:16.132,00:20:20.260,"I really like my cast, but it’s starting to itch."
00:20:20.344,00:20:23.597,Good thing my mom made me this personal scratcher.
00:20:24.598,00:20:26.475,"Oh, that’s good stuff."
00:20:26.559,00:20:31.313,"If another woman is messing with your man, you have to get proactive."
00:20:31.397,00:20:35.567,I don’t care how pretty she is or how many stupid reptiles she has.
00:20:35.651,00:20:40.573,"She tries to take what’s mine, girlfriend’s gonna get stung."
00:00:02.252,00:00:04.003,Do we really have to wear these ugly sweaters?
00:00:04.087,00:00:06.005,It’s just until Grandma can see them.
00:00:06.089,00:00:07.757,My neck hole is too small. Mine’s itchy.
00:00:07.841,00:00:10.009,You know what? I’d rather be itchy than chokey.
00:00:10.093,00:00:11.594,"Come on, Phil. Hurry up."
00:00:11.678,00:00:13.263,"Okay, here we go."
00:00:13.347,00:00:14.931,Connecting.
00:00:25.817,00:00:27.694,Merry Christmas Eve!
00:00:27.778,00:00:29.404,"A little– little lower, Dad."
00:00:31.531,00:00:33.449,Get it?
00:00:33.533,00:00:36.035,"- Thanks for the sweaters. - I-I– Oh, you’re welcome."
00:00:36.119,00:00:37.912,"You look beautiful in them, darling."
00:00:37.996,00:00:40.915,- Where’s Mom? - Mom is sinking fast.
00:00:42.793,00:00:44.043,Get it?
00:00:44.127,00:00:46.379,"Honey, come on."
00:00:46.463,00:00:48.464,"Hey, Pops, here’s the tree."
00:00:48.548,00:00:53.469,"And, uh, there-there’s the, uh– there’s the ornament you sent us."
00:00:55.722,00:01:00.810,"There are the stockings, hung by the chimney by Claire."
00:01:04.314,00:01:05.899,Still funny.
00:01:05.983,00:01:07.901,What is that? That looks like a cigarette burn.
00:01:07.985,00:01:09.444,Was one of you smoking a cigarette?
00:01:12.155,00:01:15.241,Not me. I have a respiratory problem.
00:01:15.325,00:01:18.369,"Honey, come here."
00:01:21.331,00:01:23.416,Philip?
00:01:23.500,00:01:26.753,"Anyway, merry Christmas!"
00:01:41.351,00:01:43.353,It’s just because he says he’s Santa Claus.
00:01:46.732,00:01:49.609,Are you crying?
00:01:49.693,00:01:52.946,"What are you, a robot? It’s a deeply emotional movie."
00:01:53.030,00:01:55.949,"Manny, mi amor, I need you to help me in the kitchen."
00:01:56.033,00:01:59.619,"We gotta finish this first, Gloria. The kid’s never seen Miracle on 34th Street."
00:01:59.703,00:02:02.789,That’s because he always spends Christmas in Colombia with my family.
00:02:02.873,00:02:06.125,And all we see there is Salazar and El Oso Save Christmas.
00:02:06.209,00:02:07.961,Sounds like a classic.
00:02:08.045,00:02:10.755,"Mom, can we finish the movie? Okay."
00:02:13.216,00:02:15.176,He must be Santa.
00:02:15.260,00:02:17.929,"I think perhaps you’re right, Susie."
00:02:19.723,00:02:21.140,What the hell is that?
00:02:21.224,00:02:23.476,Inocente!
00:02:23.560,00:02:28.773,"When you told me we were going to watch this movie, I got a joke copy from the Internet."
00:02:30.859,00:02:34.654,"Well, maybe I’m a little confused right now. What is this inocente stuff?"
00:02:39.826,00:02:45.957,"We tell practical jokes on April Fool’s Day, so do not do that again."
00:02:46.041,00:02:49.127,Inocente.
00:02:49.211,00:02:51.879,"Does it do it again? Ah, it’s ruined."
00:02:53.715,00:02:56.301,I’m gonna ask Santa for the last 45 minutes of my life back.
00:02:56.385,00:02:58.970,Would you cheer up? We’re in Santa’s Village with our daughter.
00:02:59.054,00:03:02.557,Where were we a year ago?
00:03:09.981,00:03:12.233,"Oh, it’s them."
00:03:12.317,00:03:13.568,It’s them.
00:03:16.947,00:03:18.865,We were known as The Greensleevers.
00:03:18.949,00:03:30.585,"We would perform at charity events, hospitals– Uh, last year, one of my carolers– Andrew– staged a little coup."
00:03:56.153,00:03:57.779,Thank you.
00:03:57.863,00:04:00.406,We’re the New Greensleevers.
00:04:03.368,00:04:04.869,The New Greensleevers?
00:04:06.496,00:04:08.581,"I mean, why is Edna singing the low harmony?"
00:04:08.665,00:04:10.583,It’s like people are applauding out of shock.
00:04:10.667,00:04:12.001,Let it go.
00:04:10.667,00:04:14.004,"Why would– Okay, next."
00:04:18.800,00:04:20.760,What happened to the other Santa?
00:04:20.844,00:04:25.640,"Listen, we’ve been waiting in this line for a really long time, and we just want a Santa that actually looks like Santa."
00:04:25.724,00:04:27.934,"Mitchell, it’s okay. No, no, no. Cam, it’s not okay."
00:04:28.018,00:04:30.645,This is Lily’s first Christmas. I want to make sure everything is perfect.
00:04:33.356,00:04:35.441,All right?
00:04:35.525,00:04:37.485,I-I don’t even know why we hired this guy.
00:04:37.569,00:04:39.946,See? Even his elves agree with me. Thank you.
00:04:40.030,00:04:42.490,I didn’t know Christmas made you so petty.
00:04:51.208,00:04:53.960,"This is unacceptable, and I want to know who did this."
00:04:56.880,00:04:59.132,I guess the couch did it to itself.
00:04:59.216,00:05:02.635,"Guess it came home after a tough day, lit up a cigarette and then it burned itself."
00:05:02.719,00:05:05.346,Is that what happened? Because that makes no sense.
00:05:05.430,00:05:07.640,"If whoever is responsible doesn’t come forward, your father and I..."
00:05:07.724,00:05:09.517,are just gonna have to punish all three of you.
00:05:09.601,00:05:10.768,What?
00:05:10.852,00:05:14.313,"- That’s not fair! - I can forgive the smoking, but I can’t forgive the lie."
00:05:14.397,00:05:16.358,Or the smoking.
00:05:17.484,00:05:20.695,"No one wants to confess, huh? No?"
00:05:20.779,00:05:22.905,"That’s fine, ’cause you know what happens next?"
00:05:22.989,00:05:24.532,We cancel Christmas!
00:05:29.371,00:05:32.248,Phil has a habit of making big pronouncements to the kids.
00:05:35.001,00:05:39.380,"that if he didn’t put his dirty dishes in the dishwasher, we would put them in his bed."
00:05:45.845,00:05:50.349,"We had no more dishes, so we were eating cereal out of the goldfish bowl."
00:05:50.433,00:05:52.477,Okay. Guess where I’m headed?
00:05:52.561,00:05:54.896,To take down the tree. That’s right.
00:05:54.980,00:05:56.481,"Come on, guys."
00:05:56.565,00:05:58.441,"Whoever did this, just take responsibility."
00:05:58.525,00:06:01.944,Don’t put the rest of us through this. Luke? No?
00:06:02.028,00:06:05.574,This is really it. Okay? Here we go.
00:06:07.033,00:06:09.911,"Three, two, one."
00:06:11.079,00:06:13.456,"Okay. Good-bye, Dunphy Christmas."
00:06:13.540,00:06:15.458,"Haley, I guess you’re not getting that car."
00:06:15.542,00:06:18.711,"- I was getting a car? - Nope. I was lying, because that’s what we do now."
00:06:18.795,00:06:21.089,Dunphys are liars.
00:06:28.680,00:06:31.390,"When I was in charge, it was all about the music."
00:06:34.477,00:06:37.396,It’s pandering.
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.400,"- Let me give you a hand with that. - Uh, thanks."
00:06:41.484,00:06:43.903,"Thanks. Thanks, Santa."
00:06:43.987,00:06:46.280,Just got canned.
00:06:46.364,00:06:47.907,Oh– Really?
00:06:47.991,00:06:50.076,Guess a couple people complained I wasn’t fat enough.
00:06:50.160,00:06:53.913,"Well, that’s terrible. That’s what I get for trying not to have a second heart attack."
00:06:53.997,00:06:56.582,There you go. Always a way to make room.
00:06:56.666,00:06:59.585,Take it from someone who lives in his car.
00:06:56.666,00:07:01.587,"Um– Oh, well, thank you so much."
00:07:01.671,00:07:03.548,No problem. Merry Christmas.
00:07:06.926,00:07:08.469,for your troubles.
00:07:10.513,00:07:14.934,Yeah. It’s not so bad. It’s pretty roomy since the wife moved out.
00:07:18.104,00:07:20.731,- Seriously? - Yeah. It’s Christmas Eve.
00:07:20.815,00:07:22.942,Y-You can’t spend it in your car.
00:07:23.026,00:07:24.944,"Wow, that’s really nice of you guys."
00:07:25.028,00:07:28.239,"Listen, can I bring anything? Ketchup, soy sauce, straws?"
00:07:28.323,00:07:30.241,We’re good.
00:07:32.744,00:07:34.287,Okay.
00:07:37.791,00:07:39.209,Cameron.
00:07:42.087,00:07:47.091,"Okay. Tonight, 9:00 sharp, we open one present each."
00:07:47.175,00:07:48.801,Pajamas– which we sleep in.
00:07:48.885,00:07:54.265,"Tomorrow morning, 7:00 a.m., Manny, on the stairs for the Christmas picture."
00:07:54.349,00:07:56.726,Then we open presents.
00:07:56.810,00:08:00.062,"In Colombia, they open presents at midnight and stay up till morning."
00:08:00.146,00:08:05.067,"I’m sure that they do, but as you’ll notice from the absence of goats in the street, we are not in Colombia."
00:08:05.151,00:08:07.903,Come on! I’m kidding.
00:08:07.987,00:08:10.906,Why can’t we mix a couple of Colombian traditions in?
00:08:10.990,00:08:13.492,- Like what? - Like fireworks.
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.453,Come on. You don’t have fireworks in Colombia.
00:08:15.537,00:08:17.204,You’re trying to make me the inocente again.
00:08:17.288,00:08:20.666,"No, we do. At night the sky is beautiful– very Christmassy."
00:08:20.750,00:08:24.420,"- That doesn’t make any sense. - Look, every country has their own traditions."
00:08:24.504,00:08:27.381,"In our culture, for example, the baby Jesus is the one..."
00:08:29.926,00:08:34.347,But that doesn’t make sense. How could a newborn baby carry all those presents?
00:08:34.431,00:08:36.098,They don’t even know where their hands are.
00:08:36.182,00:08:38.017,At least a baby can fit through a chimney.
00:08:38.101,00:08:41.687,How would you sit on the baby Jesus’ lap? You’d squish it.
00:08:41.771,00:08:45.524,"Manny, next year we’ll talk about some of your little Colombian traditions."
00:08:45.608,00:08:48.611,- Okay? Maybe. - I know what maybe means.
00:08:48.695,00:08:51.114,It’s like you’re trying to take away my whole Christmas.
00:08:52.490,00:08:55.743,I can’t believe it’s all gone. Dad never follows through.
00:08:55.827,00:08:58.371,Are you sure one of your friends didn’t burn the couch?
00:08:58.455,00:09:02.625,"Hey, don’t look at me. Only one of us was ever caught playing with matches."
00:09:02.709,00:09:06.712,Luke?
00:09:06.796,00:09:08.422,- You admit you did it! - No!
00:09:08.506,00:09:10.675,"Okay. Look, I have an idea."
00:09:10.759,00:09:12.719,Do you remember the movie Spartacus?
00:09:15.138,00:09:19.308,"Here’s what we do: Luke, you tell Mom and Dad it’s your fault."
00:09:19.392,00:09:21.477,- I didn’t do it. - It doesn’t matter.
00:09:21.561,00:09:26.440,"Because after you confess, Haley and I will each confess to the same thing."
00:09:26.524,00:09:28.442,How does that do anything?
00:09:28.526,00:09:30.903,They’ll be so touched that we’re protecting each other...
00:09:30.987,00:09:33.406,that they’ll have to bring back Christmas.
00:09:33.490,00:09:35.366,That’s awesome.
00:09:36.367,00:09:37.952,How does it work again?
00:09:38.036,00:09:40.079,We’re gonna pass into legend.
00:09:40.163,00:09:42.415,- The parents who canceled Christmas. - I thought you’d be happy.
00:09:42.499,00:09:46.836,"They’ll write songs about us, make one of those Christmas specials with those ugly little clay people."
00:09:46.920,00:09:50.423,You’re the one who always says I shouldn’t be such a pushover with the kids.
00:09:50.507,00:09:53.926,"- So this is where you decide to make your stand? Really, Phil? - Okay. Okay, look."
00:09:54.010,00:09:55.928,Don’t worry. We’re going to have Christmas.
00:09:56.012,00:09:58.764,We’ve raised our kids right. Whoever did it will come forward.
00:09:58.848,00:10:01.434,Or the other two will rat ’em out.
00:10:12.362,00:10:14.822,I was playing with matches. I’m sorry.
00:10:18.368,00:10:24.790,"by confessing, but, um– This is bad, buddy. I mean, really bad, okay?"
00:10:24.874,00:10:27.626,"Claire, you want to handle this?"
00:10:27.710,00:10:30.713,"Um, Luke, why didn’t you say something?"
00:10:30.797,00:10:32.548,"Mmm, I don’t know."
00:10:39.556,00:10:41.891,Alex!
00:10:41.975,00:10:43.184,Haley!
00:10:43.268,00:10:45.227,- Say something! - About what?
00:10:45.311,00:10:47.146,"Uh, I take it back! What is going on?"
00:10:47.230,00:10:50.649,"These guys were gonna say they did it too, and you were gonna be proud of all of us."
00:10:50.733,00:10:53.152,Why would we do that?
00:10:53.236,00:10:54.987,Liars! I didn’t do it!
00:10:55.071,00:10:56.864,"Well, it wasn’t me."
00:10:56.948,00:10:58.991,Seriously?
00:11:03.288,00:11:05.998,Guess what? Christmas is still canceled.
00:11:06.082,00:11:08.000,That’s fine by me.
00:11:08.084,00:11:10.753,Let’s start working on next year.
00:11:10.837,00:11:13.088,"Hey, and memo to New Year’s Eve..."
00:11:21.431,00:11:24.016,Now I go from town to town picking up odd jobs.
00:11:24.100,00:11:25.684,Oh. Kinda like the Hulk.
00:11:25.768,00:11:32.108,That’s weird. That was my nickname in the corps– ’cause of my bad temper.
00:11:33.109,00:11:38.614,"Anyway, thanks for having me over, having me for dinner, letting me do my laundry."
00:11:38.698,00:11:41.909,It’s not been a good day.
00:11:41.993,00:11:46.539,"Um, Scott, I-I have a confession to make."
00:11:46.623,00:11:52.962,"Um, I didn’t, uh– I didn’t clean the lint tray, so, um, your clothes might be a little pilly."
00:11:53.046,00:11:55.214,"Oh, no problem. That’s the least of my worries."
00:11:58.343,00:12:01.303,- It’s the least we could do. - What do you mean?
00:12:09.646,00:12:12.231,I just say we never tell him.
00:12:12.315,00:12:15.985,"We give him some money, a hot meal, laundry. I think we’re square."
00:12:16.069,00:12:18.529,"Agreed. Okay, how does this thing work?"
00:12:18.613,00:12:21.532,"Yeah, I think you just press that button right there in the middle. Yeah."
00:12:21.616,00:12:25.244,"Oh, my– Okay. That– That seems a little high, doesn’t it?"
00:12:31.501,00:12:33.419,It’s your dad.
00:12:33.503,00:12:36.505,"Hey, Dad. Hi."
00:12:36.589,00:12:39.258,I brought your presents.
00:12:39.342,00:12:41.594,These are your Christmas Eve gifts. You know the drill.
00:12:41.678,00:12:43.888,You open those up before bedtime. They’re pajamas.
00:12:43.972,00:12:46.765,"Still keeping traditions alive, huh?"
00:12:46.849,00:12:51.145,I got two Colombians at home trying to turn Christmas into Cinco de Mayo.
00:12:51.229,00:12:53.939,"You know that’s Mexican, right?"
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.900,Christmas should be Christmas.
00:12:55.984,00:12:59.028,"Picture on the stairs, hot chocolate, opening the presents."
00:12:59.112,00:13:02.156,That was supposed to be the good thing about having a kid in the house again.
00:13:02.240,00:13:04.742,I can have Christmas the way we used to.
00:13:04.826,00:13:08.037,"If I was home right now, I’d be mixin’ up a bathtub full of eggnog..."
00:13:12.375,00:13:13.710,Do you?
00:13:15.336,00:13:21.634,"The point is that those are memories that I’ll always have, but now I have the perfect opportunity..."
00:13:21.718,00:13:23.302,to create new memories with my new family...
00:13:23.386,00:13:25.179,that are gonna be just as special someday.
00:13:25.263,00:13:28.182,"Aw. No. Cam’s right, you know."
00:13:28.266,00:13:30.017,We create new traditions every year.
00:13:30.101,00:13:33.187,"So, who’s ready to try the swing?"
00:13:40.486,00:13:43.572,first thing tomorrow ’cause Jay wants to eat at 3:00.
00:13:43.656,00:13:47.368,"Ay, Manny! Did you put this spider in the fridge?"
00:13:47.452,00:13:49.495,"Oh, yeah. Inocente."
00:13:49.579,00:13:51.664,"Ay, papi, what’s wrong?"
00:13:51.748,00:13:55.668,I want to have Christmas like they do in Colombia. Jay is messing everything up.
00:13:55.752,00:14:01.131,"Manny, try to understand. Jay has great memories with his kids when they were young."
00:14:01.215,00:14:03.426,And he just wants to recreate them with you.
00:14:04.719,00:14:06.720,"So, maybe the best gift I could give Jay would be..."
00:14:06.804,00:14:08.889,Christmas like he used to have it?
00:14:11.601,00:14:13.602,"One day you’re gonna grow up, and I’m gonna miss..."
00:14:13.686,00:14:15.854,all the things that you used to do as a little boy.
00:14:15.938,00:14:19.066,Okay. But if this so-called Santa Claus...
00:14:19.150,00:14:23.362,"doesn’t bring me a burgundy dinner jacket, we’re going to have a big problem."
00:14:25.198,00:14:27.325,Honey?
00:14:28.951,00:14:30.953,Would it really be so bad to back down?
00:14:31.037,00:14:33.914,And have the kids never take any of our threats seriously again?
00:14:33.998,00:14:35.958,Yeah.
00:14:38.628,00:14:41.422,Or... the kids could realize...
00:14:41.506,00:14:43.757,that we’re making a supreme sacrifice...
00:14:43.841,00:14:46.885,by giving up our power to save their Christmas.
00:14:46.969,00:14:50.681,"Which would, in a way, be the greatest gift that we could ever give them."
00:14:50.765,00:14:53.392,And which would paradoxically make them respect us even more.
00:14:53.476,00:14:55.394,"Okay, forget that. Go back one."
00:14:55.478,00:14:57.604,"Hey, guys."
00:15:00.191,00:15:01.776,What?
00:15:03.611,00:15:10.242,"I found a cigarette at school, and when no one was home, I– I tried it."
00:15:10.326,00:15:14.955,And I-I guess I held it too close to the couch.
00:15:15.039,00:15:17.166,I’m so sorry.
00:15:17.250,00:15:21.253,"You can take my Christmas away, but don’t take it from everyone else."
00:15:21.337,00:15:23.255,That is very noble of you– Mm-hmm.
00:15:23.339,00:15:26.425,"to care about the family, but you still smoked and lied."
00:15:26.509,00:15:28.427,That’s really bad.
00:15:28.511,00:15:30.804,Now help me grab the tree.
00:15:30.888,00:15:33.850,"Phil, Alex, come on back."
00:15:45.528,00:15:47.613,Fine.
00:15:47.697,00:15:49.698,Everybody!
00:15:53.202,00:15:54.787,It is? What happened?
00:15:54.871,00:15:57.456,"Doesn’t matter. Stockings, lights, ornaments, wreath!"
00:15:57.540,00:15:59.542,"Go, go, go!"
00:16:00.751,00:16:03.337,"Well, that sounds like a stressful job to me."
00:16:11.804,00:16:14.640,"Well, I don’t want to overstay my welcome. You won’t have me back."
00:16:17.310,00:16:19.228,You’re good people.
00:16:21.230,00:16:23.733,"Scott. Wait, wait."
00:16:24.817,00:16:26.485,Don’t forget your laundry.
00:16:26.569,00:16:28.487,"Oh! Thanks. Thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks."
00:16:28.571,00:16:30.030,"- Merry Christmas. - Scott, merry Christmas to you."
00:16:32.533,00:16:35.327,- What? - Oh. It’s the New Greensleevers.
00:16:35.411,00:16:37.871,They’re Cameron’s old caroling group. They kicked him out this year.
00:16:40.875,00:16:42.584,but to rub my nose in it!
00:16:42.668,00:16:45.587,I’m turning on the sprinklers.
00:16:49.842,00:16:57.599,To see the fear in a man’s eyes is– But there’s something that feels even better.
00:16:57.683,00:17:00.686,Forgiveness.
00:17:00.770,00:17:04.064,"Scott, you don’t understand. This– This group was my Dreamgirls."
00:17:05.775,00:17:09.361,You know what the best thing I did all day was?
00:17:26.337,00:17:28.505,Andrew.
00:17:28.589,00:17:30.132,Ensemble.
00:17:30.216,00:17:36.180,"Uh, I know it’s no accident that you’re here on my street tonight."
00:17:36.264,00:17:43.353,And I– I just wanted to say to you all that you sound great.
00:17:43.437,00:17:46.398,And... merry Christmas.
00:17:48.192,00:17:50.110,Even your apology is off-key.
00:17:50.194,00:17:51.904,"Not cool, buddy."
00:17:53.656,00:17:56.950,"Well, I should, uh, probably scoot."
00:17:57.034,00:17:59.912,But-But– But what about forgiveness?
00:17:59.996,00:18:02.123,You were nice. He was naughty.
00:18:05.918,00:18:09.171,Where were you for so long?
00:18:11.132,00:18:13.091,What’s this?
00:18:13.175,00:18:15.093,Who? What?
00:18:15.177,00:18:17.179,It’s a Colombian traditional Christmas food.
00:18:17.263,00:18:19.181,"Okay, new rule: From now on..."
00:18:21.851,00:18:24.728,We do American things when we’re in America.
00:18:24.812,00:18:27.231,"That means no more of your food, no more of your music..."
00:18:27.315,00:18:30.109,and especially no more of your crazy holidays!
00:18:35.865,00:18:38.408,What? Did I say it wrong? You two are total inocentes!
00:18:38.492,00:18:40.994,- You should see the look on your faces. - Aw!
00:18:41.078,00:18:44.122,And by the way– You know how hard it is to get fireworks on Christmas Eve?
00:18:51.422,00:18:55.133,All righty. Here’s another one for Luke.
00:18:55.217,00:18:58.303,Looks like a book.
00:18:58.387,00:19:02.015,"What is that? Oh, my God. The couch is smoking."
00:19:02.099,00:19:04.435,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa."
00:19:06.896,00:19:08.397,It’s sunlight.
00:19:14.403,00:19:16.363,"Hey, how weird is that? It’s burning a hole..."
00:19:16.447,00:19:18.949,in the exact same spot that Alex was smoking in.
00:19:19.033,00:19:20.575,"Oh, Haley."
00:19:20.659,00:19:23.078,"Alex, why’d you take the blame?"
00:19:23.162,00:19:25.998,I didn’t want to lose Christmas.
00:19:26.082,00:19:28.875,That is so stinking beautiful.
00:19:28.959,00:19:30.877,Mm-hmm.
00:19:30.961,00:19:32.713,Yes.
00:19:32.797,00:19:33.880,"Oh, no."
00:19:38.302,00:19:41.680,Wait a– You were going to take Christmas away for something that none of us did?
00:19:41.764,00:19:46.018,"Well, um, Christmas is about moving forward."
00:19:46.102,00:19:48.895,I’ve never heard that.
00:19:48.979,00:19:51.565,You called us all liars.
00:19:48.979,00:19:58.405,"And– Yeah, and then– It’s hard to say. I don’t know. Let’s– Yeah, you did, and then– Let’s not all get worked up. I made a mistake!"
00:19:58.489,00:20:03.035,I made a mistake. And people make mistakes.
00:20:03.119,00:20:09.624,And they make up for those mistakes– Mm-hmm?
00:20:09.708,00:20:14.379,taking their family to Italy!
00:20:15.965,00:20:20.302,Yeah! Yeah!
00:20:22.513,00:20:24.556,Who wants some dark meat?
00:20:28.352,00:20:36.401,"But as much as we love our traditions, sometimes our best memories come from the times that are the most untraditional."
00:20:36.485,00:20:38.446,Inocente!
00:20:40.322,00:20:43.617,We remember the year Mom and Dad went crazy.
00:20:43.701,00:20:48.247,We remember the year Santa punched out the caroler.
00:20:50.207,00:20:55.128,"But for me, this was the year that the word tradition..."
00:20:55.212,00:20:57.214,got a lot bigger.
00:21:28.370,00:21:30.956,You got me again.
00:00:02.419,00:00:04.337,What’s the most irritating thing my parents say to me?
00:00:04.421,00:00:07.215,That’s too much cologne.
00:00:07.299,00:00:09.676,That’s how girls end up dead.
00:00:09.760,00:00:11.678,Don’t talk black to me.
00:00:11.762,00:00:14.848,It’s inappropriate because she’s your teacher.
00:00:14.932,00:00:16.850,How do you even talk black?
00:00:16.934,00:00:20.770,End words with izzle?
00:00:20.854,00:00:22.772,Oh.
00:00:22.856,00:00:25.108,Act more like an adult.
00:00:25.192,00:00:28.403,What does act more like an adult even mean?
00:00:32.324,00:00:34.284,You’re the one who wanted to do it!
00:00:36.119,00:00:37.745,"Oh, I picked up one of those Water Weasels."
00:00:40.916,00:00:44.586,Just like a weasel.
00:00:44.670,00:00:46.421,I put the weasel in my pants.
00:00:48.507,00:00:50.592,Is there a reason why my window’s wet?
00:00:50.676,00:00:52.802,Hmm. Very difficult to say.
00:00:52.886,00:00:55.471,Up top– Ow! Ow!
00:00:55.555,00:00:57.056,"Little– Sweetie, you okay?"
00:00:57.140,00:00:58.558,Little twinge. Yeah.
00:00:58.642,00:01:01.144,- I’ll call 911. - Maybe the firemen will come.
00:01:03.230,00:01:07.567,The firemen in our town have a reputation for being hot.
00:01:07.651,00:01:09.819,Do I resent that? Of course not. These guys are my friends.
00:01:09.903,00:01:11.821,I play basketball with them. I bake for ’em.
00:01:11.905,00:01:14.240,My question is: What’s hot?
00:01:16.326,00:01:19.704,"Coming. Manny, it’s inappropriate because it’s your teacher."
00:01:21.790,00:01:24.792,It’s a surprise. You’ll see.
00:01:28.964,00:01:31.883,They got a chef there that can flip a shrimp into his own hat.
00:01:31.967,00:01:33.468,What the hell?
00:01:34.845,00:01:37.931,Dad!
00:01:38.015,00:01:39.891,The hell is he doing here?
00:01:43.437,00:01:46.606,Now he just sails in here out of the blue?
00:01:46.690,00:01:49.901,I don’t like the guy. Do I have reasons? Yeah.
00:01:49.985,00:01:52.111,Good reasons? Yeah.
00:02:08.045,00:02:15.301,"So I would have called, but while I was buying this boat for a friend, - I got chased out to sea by another boat y tiqui tiqui. - Were they pirates?"
00:02:15.385,00:02:17.428,I didn’t stop to ask.
00:02:17.512,00:02:20.556,Did they have curvy swords and sing songs about how fun it is to be a pirate?
00:02:24.227,00:02:26.145,"So, we were just headed out to dinner."
00:02:26.229,00:02:29.899,"What, you think I show up empty-handed? I brought dinner– lobsters!"
00:02:32.569,00:02:36.364,- But I bought them with my bare hands. - Wow!
00:02:36.448,00:02:38.825,"And I have some nice wine, a good Cuban cigar for Jay."
00:02:38.909,00:02:42.203,"Hey, why don’t you take a picture of him with your new camera phone."
00:02:42.287,00:02:45.331,- I don’t have a camera phone. - You do now.
00:02:45.415,00:02:49.419,"Awesome! All of this excitement, my heart is just going."
00:02:49.503,00:02:53.131,"Now, listen to me. You bring that with you when you come visit me this summer."
00:02:53.215,00:02:56.592,"We’ll go in a race car with my friend, and after that, maybe a bullfight."
00:03:00.680,00:03:02.348,You’re quite the bullfight artist yourself.
00:03:02.432,00:03:05.768,"I, uh– Manny, why don’t you show your father to the kitchen?"
00:03:05.852,00:03:08.104,Por favor. Dios mío. Someone put on some music.
00:03:08.188,00:03:10.356,"- Tonight, we dance! - Oh, we’re gonna dance."
00:03:10.440,00:03:13.401,"Oye, mi amor, ¿está bien que me quede aquí esta noche?"
00:03:13.485,00:03:15.653,"Ay, Javier, yo no sé. Espérate para ver qué puedo hacer."
00:03:15.737,00:03:18.489,What did he say? Does he need money for the lobsters?
00:03:18.573,00:03:20.491,"Jay, be nice."
00:03:20.575,00:03:23.244,"I could be sitting grill-side, watching a guy build an onion volcano."
00:03:23.328,00:03:28.207,"Instead, I got Rico Suave in my kitchen, and I got a stolen boat in my driveway."
00:03:28.291,00:03:30.335,"If it was for me, he’d be out of my life."
00:03:32.796,00:03:35.757,I just can’t believe you ever fell for that act.
00:03:39.136,00:03:43.431,They can make you agree to things before you even know it. You must have been pretty naive.
00:03:43.515,00:03:47.018,"Yeah. But now I’m with the right man, okay?"
00:03:47.102,00:03:50.563,Javier is only going to stay one night.
00:03:50.647,00:03:52.149,"Wait, what?"
00:03:57.654,00:04:00.574,Don’t be mad. I just got up to change her.
00:04:01.867,00:04:03.868,"Well, Mitchell really wanted to Ferberize the baby."
00:04:03.952,00:04:07.747,Ferberize. It is a method of getting the baby to sleep through the night...
00:04:07.831,00:04:11.167,"by, yes, basically letting her cry herself to sleep."
00:04:11.251,00:04:14.253,Torture.
00:04:14.337,00:04:18.633,It’s just hard if you happen to be a person who hates to hear another person suffer.
00:04:27.100,00:04:38.945,"No, no. You got up to comfort her, which only teaches her that every time she cries, her daddy will come in and cuddle her and put on her favorite– Brian De Palma’s controversial masterpiece Scarface."
00:04:39.029,00:04:41.280,For the baby?
00:04:41.364,00:04:46.369,"She happens to like it. I don’t know if it’s the colors or the sounds– Oh, here comes the nightclub massacre. She loves it."
00:04:46.453,00:04:48.830,Watch her little eyelids. It’s so cute. They get so heavy.
00:04:52.417,00:04:54.794,"Oh, honey."
00:04:54.878,00:04:57.004,"I’m just– Okay, that’s cancer."
00:04:57.088,00:04:59.799,Maybe it’s just a kidney stone.
00:04:59.883,00:05:02.552,"- What’s going on, guys? - It’s nothing. Go back to bed."
00:05:02.636,00:05:04.554,"No, but Dad– Don’t touch me."
00:05:04.638,00:05:06.931,I bet it’s just a kidney stone.
00:05:07.015,00:05:08.683,Someone get your mom a glass of water...
00:05:08.767,00:05:11.769,and a piece of gravel from the driveway and see how she likes it.
00:05:11.853,00:05:14.689,Why is everybody yelling?
00:05:14.773,00:05:16.482,Don’t frighten him. Come here.
00:05:16.566,00:05:19.193,"Oh, that’s gotta be death! Death is coming!"
00:05:19.277,00:05:21.028,"Okay, you need to go to the hospital."
00:05:21.112,00:05:23.990,"No, no, no. I just need a pill. Give me the biggest one you can find."
00:05:26.409,00:05:30.580,That’s what I told you when you were in labor and you threw my smoothie at me. Pill!
00:05:30.664,00:05:32.707,"- Okay, I’m calling. - No, no, it’s fine!"
00:05:32.791,00:05:35.376,It’s actually– It’s fine. It’s passing. It’s passing.
00:05:41.091,00:05:42.884,I am definitely gonna call.
00:05:42.968,00:05:45.887,All systems down. All systems down.
00:05:52.936,00:05:54.854,Son of a bitch.
00:05:54.938,00:05:57.106,"He’s playing on my pool table, that’s what."
00:05:57.190,00:05:59.859,Probably got himself a nice drink too.
00:05:59.943,00:06:02.153,"Just to check things out, okay?"
00:06:13.790,00:06:16.250,"No. No, I’m a light sleeper."
00:06:16.334,00:06:19.295,That’s what happens when you get older.
00:06:19.379,00:06:22.298,I didn’t say I was old.
00:06:22.382,00:06:25.801,Life is just more interesting after 2:00 a.m.
00:06:25.885,00:06:29.430,"You know, the liquor tastes better, the, uh, women are more beautiful."
00:06:29.514,00:06:33.559,What is it they say? That the night belongs to the poets and the madmen.
00:06:35.395,00:06:37.897,Which are you?
00:06:37.981,00:06:39.982,"And I think maybe you too, huh?"
00:06:40.066,00:06:42.735,I see a picture over here of you on a motorcycle.
00:06:42.819,00:06:44.904,You ride?
00:06:44.988,00:06:47.573,Used to? Used to?
00:06:47.657,00:06:51.911,"Jay, the saddest words in any language, my friend."
00:06:51.995,00:06:55.790,"Hey, help me out here. Everybody sees you as this great guy."
00:06:55.874,00:06:58.000,"You know, you live this life of adventure."
00:06:58.084,00:07:01.003,How come I don’t buy a word of it?
00:07:01.087,00:07:03.422,All I see is a dad who doesn’t show up.
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.383,"Hey, Manny knows me. I live in the now."
00:07:05.467,00:07:08.761,"Well, I was living in the yesterday when Manny was crying outside that door..."
00:07:11.181,00:07:16.143,"And when I don’t come, you think, uh– what, I’m just off chasing a good time, hmm?"
00:07:19.689,00:07:21.816,Why? Because of Gloria?
00:07:23.193,00:07:25.195,Because of you.
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.625,"Okay, they’re on their way."
00:07:39.709,00:07:45.339,"Okay, kids, gather around. Like you’re hugging me, but don’t touch me, okay?"
00:07:45.423,00:07:48.301,"Now look, I’m gonna be fine."
00:07:48.385,00:07:51.721,"- We know, Dad. - We don’t know that. It’s a miracle I’m standing up."
00:07:56.434,00:07:59.895,"I want you to know that if I’d had time, I would have fixed that step."
00:07:59.979,00:08:01.564,"Thanks, Dad."
00:08:01.648,00:08:05.610,"Don’t cry, Luke. I’m okay."
00:08:05.694,00:08:07.653,I broke the coffee table!
00:08:07.737,00:08:09.488,That’s okay. What?
00:08:09.572,00:08:13.075,I broke the glass coffee table.
00:08:09.572,00:08:15.494,"The one you swore you didn’t break, and then we blamed Esperanza and fired her..."
00:08:15.578,00:08:19.165,and she stole a turkey at Thanksgiving for her family and got deported?
00:08:25.255,00:08:26.839,Really?
00:08:25.255,00:08:31.761,Okay– Hmm.
00:08:35.140,00:08:38.893,"Into that sexy, clingy– Oh, my God. It’s the firemen."
00:08:38.977,00:08:40.895,"No, sweetie."
00:08:40.979,00:08:43.939,I’m out here convulsing in agony and you’re looking for cute tops to wear?
00:08:44.023,00:08:45.983,I just threw on the first thing I could find.
00:08:49.529,00:08:51.238,"Oh, Phil, sweetie."
00:08:51.322,00:08:53.366,"By all means, Claire, we want you looking your sexiest..."
00:08:55.618,00:08:57.119,How we doing?
00:08:57.203,00:08:59.705,- He meant me! Ohh! - All right.
00:09:06.629,00:09:09.632,"No, listen, Jay. You’re a tough guy to compete with. Look at all you have."
00:09:09.716,00:09:12.802,So Manny has to suffer?
00:09:12.886,00:09:15.012,"Look, I’m going to try harder."
00:09:15.096,00:09:17.556,But maybe it’s a good thing that he has the two of us.
00:09:17.640,00:09:19.266,"From you, he learns stability."
00:09:19.350,00:09:23.562,"From me, he learns how to be spontaneous, grab life by the throat."
00:09:23.646,00:09:26.524,"Well, we do a little throat grabbing ourselves around here, you know."
00:09:26.608,00:09:28.984,We were on our way to Benihana when you showed up.
00:09:29.068,00:09:30.986,"Hey, as long as my boy follows his passion."
00:09:31.070,00:09:36.242,"The worst career decision I ever made was playing baseball, but I loved every minute of it."
00:09:38.328,00:09:40.246,I lived baseball.
00:09:40.330,00:09:44.917,"I only made it to Triple-A, but I played with all those guys– Sosa, McGwire."
00:09:45.001,00:09:47.253,You look like you played some.
00:09:47.337,00:09:51.424,I was all right. Never hit a curve ball.
00:09:54.302,00:09:58.472,Used to be. Ugh. Por favor.
00:09:58.556,00:10:00.307,"Hey, please. Come on."
00:10:00.391,00:10:03.644,"- What are you guys doing? - Manny, did we wake you up? I’m sorry."
00:10:03.728,00:10:06.147,No. I was doing my science extra credit.
00:10:06.231,00:10:09.024,"- Of course you were. - So, can I play?"
00:10:09.108,00:10:11.444,That’s up to your dad.
00:10:11.528,00:10:13.779,"Actually, I think we’re done with pool for right now."
00:10:13.863,00:10:17.534,I have a better idea for the three of us. Vamos.
00:10:19.077,00:10:22.914,"So, how do you know this guy?"
00:10:28.211,00:10:30.963,This is the coolest night ever!
00:10:31.047,00:10:35.009,"Now, let’s see about that curve ball."
00:10:38.680,00:10:43.684,Out. I thought you were– Those were pillows. Come on. Come on.
00:10:43.768,00:10:47.688,"Cameron, do you realize how infuriating this is?"
00:10:49.524,00:10:52.359,"is to teach her to put herself to sleep, and you keep ruining it."
00:10:52.443,00:10:54.820,I can’t help it. I’m like a mother bear.
00:10:54.904,00:10:57.823,"When I hear my cub crying, I have to run to her."
00:10:57.907,00:11:00.826,Except you’re not a bear. Get in our room.
00:11:00.910,00:11:03.621,"Get– Cam, get in there. Get in there."
00:11:03.705,00:11:05.414,Cut it out.
00:11:05.498,00:11:07.333,Get! Get in there.
00:11:07.417,00:11:09.251,Come on. Come on. Get in there. Get!
00:11:11.337,00:11:13.422,That’s so unfair. Why not?
00:11:13.506,00:11:15.174,Because that’s how girls end up dead.
00:11:15.258,00:11:17.676,"- Hey, honey. - Hey, guys."
00:11:17.760,00:11:20.262,We just wanted to see how you’re doing. Is this a bad time?
00:11:22.807,00:11:24.391,Which is gonna go just fine.
00:11:24.475,00:11:26.393,"- Oh, we know. - We don’t know."
00:11:26.477,00:11:30.189,"In case it doesn’t, promise me you’ll be nice to your new fireman daddy."
00:11:30.273,00:11:33.359,- Unbelievable. - My wife got dressed up for the firemen last night.
00:11:33.443,00:11:37.363,I didn’t get dressed up for the firemen.
00:11:37.447,00:11:39.532,- You put on heels? - Let’s drop it.
00:11:39.616,00:11:41.534,"What are they doing to you, Dad?"
00:11:46.623,00:11:48.207,"You’re not scared, are you?"
00:11:48.291,00:11:51.126,When was the last time you saw your old man scared?
00:11:51.210,00:11:53.128,When you walked through the spiderweb.
00:11:53.212,00:11:56.006,When we were playing with the Ouija board and the wind blew the door shut.
00:11:56.090,00:11:59.969,"There was no wind, buddy. We brought something forth."
00:12:00.053,00:12:03.305,Oh. This stuff’s really hitting me.
00:12:03.389,00:12:05.474,My insides feel like velvet.
00:12:09.812,00:12:11.647,"- Love you, Dad. - Love you."
00:12:15.652,00:12:20.781,"This is not gonna happen, okay, but there is a scenario where you could be the man of the house..."
00:12:22.992,00:12:25.286,741– I don’t wanna be the man of the house.
00:12:25.370,00:12:28.455,"Now, don’t talk black to me."
00:12:28.539,00:12:31.333,"Why don’t you wait out in the hall. He’ll be fine, okay?"
00:12:31.417,00:12:34.879,"Honey, I’m just gonna run them to school. I’ll be back right after."
00:12:34.963,00:12:37.923,Okay. Claire?
00:12:38.007,00:12:40.050,"You did get dressed up, didn’t you?"
00:12:40.134,00:12:45.472,"I pulled on the first thing I saw, okay?"
00:12:40.134,00:12:48.851,"Okay, I’ll drop it, ’cause this stuff is making me fall asleep."
00:12:48.935,00:12:53.773,"And if I never wake up, I’d hate for the last thing you ever said to me to be a lie."
00:13:16.254,00:13:18.965,"- I knew it. - Oh, damn it!"
00:13:24.971,00:13:27.515,Why are you so tired today?
00:13:30.309,00:13:32.227,Any reason I can’t take him?
00:13:32.311,00:13:35.481,I’m surprised you’re up. I know what time you went back to bed.
00:13:35.565,00:13:38.484,"Oh, it was nothing. We just went out, we hit a few balls."
00:13:38.568,00:13:41.904,And you’ll never guess where. I guess Javier knew a guy. And you know what?
00:13:41.988,00:13:45.908,"Now that he knows you, the next time he needs something, you are the guy."
00:13:48.244,00:13:50.162,"Ay, Dios mío. Did you took him with you?"
00:13:50.246,00:13:52.331,You couldn’t wait to get to school to do that?
00:13:52.415,00:13:56.085,"Manny, vámonos para el colegio. Let’s go. We’re gonna be so late. Vámonos."
00:14:00.256,00:14:03.175,I thought you said you wanted me to bond with Javier.
00:14:08.473,00:14:11.183,Then we got hot dogs.
00:14:11.267,00:14:14.603,"If I wanted to be married to a wild man, I would have stayed with Javier."
00:14:16.647,00:14:18.357,Aha! ¿Qué pasa?
00:14:24.197,00:14:27.366,"Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute. You’re not leaving, are you?"
00:14:27.450,00:14:30.077,"- What? School? - Yes, school."
00:14:30.161,00:14:32.913,"That’s where people go to learn things, like not to keep children up all night."
00:14:32.997,00:14:35.708,- He told her? - He’s weak.
00:14:35.792,00:14:39.169,"Well, listen, you said you used to like riding motorcycles, right? So I brought you one."
00:14:42.340,00:14:43.966,"- Go, Jay. - Yeah, go."
00:14:44.050,00:14:47.052,"Yes, go, Jay, and take Manny with you too!"
00:14:47.136,00:14:49.054,Okay.
00:14:51.808,00:14:53.767,"Jay, I’m not gonna argue anymore."
00:14:53.851,00:14:56.645,I’m not gonna say anything else. Do whatever you want.
00:14:56.729,00:15:05.070,"But I don’t wanna hear you any more saying that Colombians are crazy, ’cause you’re the one that is acting crazy, even though he’s the one that is making you act crazy."
00:15:05.154,00:15:07.490,So I don’t know what the hell I’m talking about! Manny!
00:15:14.247,00:15:16.081,You didn’t need to come home during nap time.
00:15:16.165,00:15:19.084,Mmm. Think we proved last night that I did.
00:15:22.505,00:15:27.760,"That’s okay. I told everyone that I have an unreliable partner, and, uh, they understood."
00:15:27.844,00:15:30.429,You know what? I don’t need to sit here and be condescended to.
00:15:30.513,00:15:34.099,I’m gonna make myself an ice tea.
00:15:34.183,00:15:37.478,- You can’t bring me down. - I’ll sweep your legs.
00:15:37.562,00:15:40.814,There’s something wrong with you...
00:15:40.898,00:15:43.609,that the sound of our child in such distress doesn’t bother you more.
00:15:43.693,00:15:47.696,"She’s not in distress, and this just proves that you need this more than she does."
00:15:49.782,00:15:52.326,Raccoons slipped into the Lawsons’ home and stole a loaf of bread.
00:15:53.828,00:15:59.666,"- Your point? - That we left Lily’s window open a crack, and those raccoons need something to put between that bread, and that is Lily’s help me cry."
00:15:59.750,00:16:01.794,"I’m coming for you, Lily."
00:16:01.878,00:16:05.130,"You are not coming, Cameron. Let me go! Hey, stop it!"
00:16:05.214,00:16:07.466,Let go! Get off me! What are you doing?
00:16:07.550,00:16:09.510,Stop!
00:16:09.594,00:16:12.304,Stop being such a baby.
00:16:12.388,00:16:15.224,Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh.
00:16:15.308,00:16:17.226,What?
00:16:17.310,00:16:19.353,My ankle.
00:16:24.275,00:16:28.904,¡Ay! I guess you didn’t kill yourself in the motorcycle today.
00:16:28.988,00:16:32.533,"Well, I figured you were looking forward to killing me, so I’m not gonna take that away from you."
00:16:34.285,00:16:36.745,"Hey, did Javier call you?"
00:16:36.829,00:16:39.081,He’s dragging me to this bar with some of his old baseball pals.
00:16:39.165,00:16:41.208,He was supposed to be here at 5:00.
00:16:48.424,00:16:51.218,What? What’s the joke?
00:16:51.302,00:16:52.970,It’s just funny to me...
00:16:53.054,00:16:58.433,"that you make fun of me because I was seduced by him, but here you are– No one is getting seduced."
00:16:58.517,00:17:00.519,I’m doing this for Manny.
00:17:00.603,00:17:05.440,"Yeah, it’s very important for Manny that you two go and have a nice picnic in the mountains."
00:17:05.524,00:17:07.526,"First of all, it wasn’t a picnic. We stopped for coffee."
00:17:10.196,00:17:12.739,"Listen. Let me know when he calls, all right?"
00:17:12.823,00:17:15.033,"Geez, it’s almost 6:00."
00:17:19.705,00:17:22.416,"Oh, me too."
00:17:22.500,00:17:27.045,"Oh, he’s a sweetie."
00:17:29.298,00:17:30.883,Except for that fireman thing.
00:17:30.967,00:17:32.885,You remember it?
00:17:36.555,00:17:38.473,There’s no excuse for it.
00:17:38.557,00:17:49.735,"I think I just spend so much time in dowdy mom clothes, and I’m covered in paste and peanut butter, and I just– I wanted to feel attractive for a second, you know?"
00:17:49.819,00:17:55.240,"I’m sorry. I really– Honey, I just need a little bit of time."
00:17:55.324,00:17:57.784,Gonna be fine.
00:17:57.868,00:17:59.786,Yeah.
00:17:59.870,00:18:01.747,I was already fine with it.
00:18:01.831,00:18:04.124,Here’s the deal: Claire messed up. She owed me.
00:18:04.208,00:18:06.960,This never happens.
00:18:07.044,00:18:09.421,Old Phil has a golden ticket.
00:18:09.505,00:18:15.219,"Now, I could have cashed that in right away for something small– get out of cleaning the garage, a week at circus camp."
00:18:15.303,00:18:17.387,Still fresh.
00:18:17.471,00:18:24.102,"But the longer you hold on to it, the more the guilt builds, the more you get."
00:18:24.186,00:18:27.606,Five years: trip to Paris with my buddies.
00:18:27.690,00:18:31.777,Ten years: sweet little convertible.
00:18:31.861,00:18:37.950,"Twenty years: hello, fully articulating, five-function robot..."
00:18:38.034,00:18:42.287,that can read my mind and has feelings.
00:18:42.371,00:18:46.124,"Phil, you’re not leaving without saying good-bye, are you?"
00:18:46.208,00:18:47.584,"Hey, Elaine."
00:18:47.668,00:18:49.127,Is this your husband?
00:18:49.211,00:18:51.797,"- Good-bye, Paris. - I’m visiting my sister..."
00:18:51.881,00:18:54.967,and he was entertaining us all afternoon with his card tricks.
00:19:00.389,00:19:02.641,"Hey, Mom, Phil’s leaving."
00:19:06.312,00:19:12.317,"Good-bye, fully articulating, five-function robot with the ability to– Good-bye."
00:19:12.401,00:19:14.027,"Brittany, hurry, honey. Phil’s leaving."
00:19:14.111,00:19:15.153,Ow.
00:19:15.237,00:19:16.697,You’re fine.
00:19:22.453,00:19:29.001,"- I’m sorry I hurt you. - No. No, don’t be. I– I could have just as easily hurt you."
00:19:29.085,00:19:31.336,"Well, it’s cute that you think that."
00:19:31.420,00:19:36.008,"Listen, Cam, I– I can’t always be the bad cop here."
00:19:36.092,00:19:41.138,"I-I know it’s my issue, but she can’t grow up with one huggy, happy, cuddly dad..."
00:19:41.222,00:19:44.850,"and one frowny, lesson-teachy dad."
00:19:44.934,00:19:49.021,Because guess which one she’s gonna ask to walk her down the aisle.
00:19:52.274,00:19:54.526,"Uh– Y– Okay, you know what?"
00:19:54.610,00:19:56.695,I can be the bad cop sometimes.
00:19:56.779,00:19:59.740,I’ll always make her eat her vegetables.
00:19:59.824,00:20:02.200,- Okay. Dentist. - Deal.
00:20:02.284,00:20:05.203,- Good. - As long as you make her practice her violin.
00:20:05.287,00:20:07.748,"Oh, yeah. The violin. I like that."
00:20:11.293,00:20:13.211,Assuming you can walk by then.
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.547,Ow!
00:20:15.631,00:20:18.425,"No, God. No, no. It’s not that bad."
00:20:22.096,00:20:24.473,"Yeah, you call, and I’m gonna change my shirt."
00:20:25.808,00:20:45.869,"So, if I’m supposed to act like an adult, is that act like adults I see in the world– ’Cause if it’s the ones in my family– Come on. Let’s go."
00:20:45.953,00:20:48.413,then...
00:20:48.497,00:20:50.833,how hard could that be?
00:20:56.255,00:21:00.175,Doing the card tricks at the hospital really got me fired up about my magic again.
00:21:03.762,00:21:06.431,"Yes. Oh, my gosh."
00:21:06.515,00:21:08.141,"It’s– It’s not, is it?"
00:21:10.394,00:21:14.356,"The hardest part is when people forget their card, because then I look like the idiot."
00:21:14.440,00:21:16.525,All right. Let’s do it again.
00:21:16.609,00:21:20.278,"You think I like this? I’m sorry. Here. I’m gonna teach you one, okay?"
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.239,"On the count of three, just grab this. You ready?"
00:21:22.323,00:21:24.241,Put your hand out.
00:21:24.325,00:21:26.785,"One, two, three. There it is."
00:21:26.869,00:21:28.537,No. What was that?
00:00:04.087,00:00:06.881,"It’s a shame you have to work, huh? Yeah."
00:00:06.965,00:00:11.511,"Anyway, I’d like a large sausage and pepperoni– It’s my stuff, okay?"
00:00:13.347,00:00:15.557,I didn’t put my hands on your stuff.
00:00:15.641,00:00:18.852,"Hey! Just a second, Derek. What is the problem?"
00:00:18.936,00:00:21.062,Alex read my journal.
00:00:23.607,00:00:27.193,"Because it contains the details of a life, and you don’t have one!"
00:00:27.277,00:00:29.612,Oh!
00:00:29.696,00:00:31.656,Sorry. My daughters.
00:00:31.740,00:00:33.908,You got kids?
00:00:33.992,00:00:35.660,Oh. What grade are you in?
00:00:35.744,00:00:37.370,"Oh, that’s my wife, Claire."
00:00:37.454,00:00:41.541,Luke was using my computer for this.
00:00:41.625,00:00:44.210,"I’m gonna have to, uh, call you back."
00:00:44.294,00:00:47.547,"He told me he needed it to do homework, and then I find this, a-a picture..."
00:00:47.631,00:00:52.469,"of a topless woman, with the biggest boobs I have ever seen, driving a tractor."
00:00:54.388,00:00:58.808,"Okay. Um– Uh, first of all, that’s a combine, not a tractor."
00:00:58.892,00:01:01.477,"Phil! It is smut, and our 10-year-old is looking at smut!"
00:01:01.561,00:01:04.647,It’s disgusting!
00:01:04.731,00:01:06.983,Here’s the thing. That was my picture.
00:01:09.528,00:01:11.654,Doesn’t matter who. Gil Thorpe.
00:01:11.738,00:01:15.116,He sent out another one of the same woman dressed as a battleship.
00:01:15.200,00:01:17.118,"You know, the– You get– Yeah."
00:01:17.202,00:01:23.917,"And then one of the Transformers– And then it– Anyway, I had every intention of telling Claire."
00:01:24.001,00:01:26.794,I just wanted her to calm down first.
00:01:26.878,00:01:29.589,Where are you going?
00:01:29.673,00:01:31.799,We need to talk to him about this now.
00:01:31.883,00:01:34.219,"Claire, this is a very delicate situation."
00:01:34.303,00:01:37.805,"If we don’t handle it right, Luke might end up having an unhealthy attitude about sex..."
00:01:37.889,00:01:39.807,or agribusiness.
00:01:39.891,00:01:42.936,We’ll talk about it when he gets home.
00:01:43.020,00:01:44.646,"Okay, fine."
00:01:44.730,00:01:48.983,"But I am telling him that every time he looks at porn, God kills a puppy."
00:01:49.067,00:01:51.027,Maybe I should be the one to talk to him.
00:01:57.534,00:01:59.536,There’s nothing that I would change.
00:02:03.123,00:02:05.291,I hate the dog butler.
00:02:07.210,00:02:11.130,"I keep forgetting it’s there. And every time it happens, it scares me all over again."
00:02:11.214,00:02:15.343,"Sometimes, at night, I think it’s the devil."
00:02:17.721,00:02:19.973,Barkley? He’s hilarious.
00:02:24.311,00:02:32.360,"And I thought, I could do the usual, be a chump, give the money back to the casino, or I could do something smart and buy something for myself at the casino store."
00:02:33.945,00:02:36.030,"Rub his chin, a little under there. He likes that."
00:02:39.451,00:02:43.663,"He’s a dog and a butler. I mean, who couldn’t love him?"
00:02:45.665,00:02:48.001,Ya me cansé.
00:02:48.085,00:02:50.837,Come.
00:02:56.718,00:02:58.720,Dog.
00:03:16.571,00:03:19.532,"- What am I, seven years old? - No. You do not want to go during the show."
00:03:19.616,00:03:22.702,"The marionettes stop what they’re doing, march to the edge of the stage and point at you."
00:03:22.786,00:03:25.580,"Okay, that sounds terrifying."
00:03:31.128,00:03:34.130,I grew up one mile away from Missouri’s largest waterslide.
00:03:34.214,00:03:36.132,And third largest in the country.
00:03:38.468,00:03:40.971,You feel like– Feel like a torpedo.
00:03:42.848,00:03:44.932,"Hey, Cam, does the gardener usually work on Saturdays?"
00:03:45.016,00:03:46.684,I don’t know. He comes when we need him.
00:03:46.768,00:03:48.394,He’s like Batman but straight.
00:03:51.481,00:03:55.568,"Oh, yeah. We should probably go out the back, huh?"
00:03:55.652,00:03:59.781,He’s clearly in pain. How can you just turn your back on a friend like that?
00:03:59.865,00:04:01.991,A friend? Really? Yeah? What’s his name?
00:04:02.075,00:04:04.619,Caesar Salazar.
00:04:04.703,00:04:08.081,You made that up. You were gonna say Caesar Salad.
00:04:08.165,00:04:11.459,Was not.
00:04:13.545,00:04:16.339,"All right, don’t worry, Lily. I’m sure we’ll get to the show on time."
00:04:16.423,00:04:25.598,"I’m sure Dad is just gonna go out and give an encouraging word to the gardener, hopefully mention the snail problem, and then we are gonna be on– No."
00:04:25.682,00:04:32.355,"No, no. Cam, no– - Hello. - I don’t think he speaks English."
00:04:32.439,00:04:34.315,"Okay, this might be a good time to mention to you..."
00:04:34.399,00:04:36.234,that the marionettes are not kind to latecomers.
00:04:36.318,00:04:38.277,They bend over and show their bloomers.
00:04:38.361,00:04:47.745,"Okay, I speak a little Spanish. Señor– Would you like to make water and have our bed?"
00:04:50.957,00:04:54.127,What was that? I just asked him if he wanted to have a glass of water...
00:04:54.211,00:04:57.588,"and sit down for a minute, like any kind person would."
00:05:16.024,00:05:18.985,"Okay, I checked the rest of the computers in the house. I didn’t find any more porn."
00:05:19.069,00:05:21.571,That was hardly porn. It was a topless woman on a tractor.
00:05:21.655,00:05:25.158,You know what they call that in Europe? A cereal commercial.
00:05:25.242,00:05:28.828,I should go talk to him.
00:05:28.912,00:05:31.664,"No, no, no, no. I got this. I got this. I was his age once."
00:05:31.748,00:05:35.918,"Breasts are like these scary, mystical things..."
00:05:36.002,00:05:39.547,that he’s drawn to like Frodo to Mordor.
00:05:41.424,00:05:43.551,Boys don’t want their moms talking to ’em about sex...
00:05:43.635,00:05:49.557,"any more than girls want their dads talking to ’em about periods, bras and girdles and all that stuff."
00:05:49.641,00:05:52.768,"You do know that women stopped wearing girdles, like, 30 years ago?"
00:05:52.852,00:05:57.190,"Honey, I know, I know. That-That-That is exactly the kind of sexual revolution..."
00:05:57.274,00:05:59.275,that our son is going through right now.
00:05:59.359,00:06:03.029,"So, just– Let’s just– just trust it."
00:06:03.113,00:06:08.535,"Fix that step. Just know, I will handle this, okay?"
00:06:21.673,00:06:24.842,Sometimes it’s good to move things around just to see how they look.
00:06:24.926,00:06:26.886,"Yeah, but the guest room? That’s crazy."
00:06:26.970,00:06:29.222,He’s not a guest. He works for us.
00:06:29.306,00:06:31.057,"Hey, give me a hand here, will you?"
00:06:31.141,00:06:33.684,"- I think his jacket shifted while I was moving him. - Ay, cómo no."
00:06:33.768,00:06:38.064,"We can’t have you untucked, our little butler. That doesn’t make any sense, does it, boy?"
00:06:38.148,00:06:39.190,¡Ay!
00:06:43.570,00:06:46.155,I’m not panicking.
00:06:46.239,00:06:48.992,"We can fix him. Let me take a better look. Come here, boy."
00:06:50.118,00:06:52.078,Luke?
00:07:09.012,00:07:12.182,How do you make sure you’ve deleted something after you read it?
00:07:14.726,00:07:16.644,"Sorry, Jay. It was an accident."
00:07:16.728,00:07:19.230,"You know, I’m beginning to think you don’t like Barkley that much."
00:07:19.314,00:07:21.983,"I mean, first you hide him in the guest room, and now this."
00:07:22.067,00:07:24.610,It’s ridiculous. I didn’t mean to hurt it.
00:07:24.694,00:07:27.113,"First of all, let’s cut the its. He is a he."
00:07:27.197,00:07:31.117,"And you can pretend to be innocent all you want, but action speaks louder than words."
00:07:31.201,00:07:34.120,Yeah. They can be very revealing.
00:07:36.956,00:07:41.794,Nothing. But you have to admit that the dog butler is a little ridiculous.
00:07:41.878,00:07:44.797,You know what else I think is ridiculous? That mountain of pillows you have on our bed.
00:07:44.881,00:07:47.967,I feel like I’m working on a loading dock just trying to get under the covers.
00:07:50.929,00:07:53.389,"Okay, forgive me for trying to make our home beautiful."
00:07:53.473,00:07:56.642,"You know, if I can put up with those, you can put up with a piece of art."
00:07:56.726,00:08:01.314,This is not art. This is an unholy mix between man and beast.
00:08:01.398,00:08:06.485,"But, fine, if you love it so much, put it wherever you want."
00:08:06.569,00:08:08.904,Thank you. Where you going? To get some more pillows?
00:08:08.988,00:08:14.202,"No, don’t worry. It’ll be a long time before I bother you again with my pillows."
00:08:17.414,00:08:19.665,Why is Dad in Luke’s room with the door closed?
00:08:19.749,00:08:22.585,They are having a little talk.
00:08:25.714,00:08:28.299,My favorite is when they’re both in trouble.
00:08:28.383,00:08:31.010,"So, what’d he do? Did he cheat on a test? He’s a cheater."
00:08:31.094,00:08:32.845,He did not cheat on a test.
00:08:32.929,00:08:34.972,Did he lie? He lies all the time.
00:08:35.056,00:08:39.060,Alex.
00:08:39.144,00:08:42.396,A lot of parents are hitting again.
00:08:39.144,00:08:44.357,"I appreciate your concern, but your father has it under control."
00:08:44.441,00:08:47.526,Twenty-four.
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.737,Twenty-five.
00:08:49.821,00:08:54.033,Flincher! Free slap. Bring it up.
00:09:00.957,00:09:02.750,Can I be on the bottom now?
00:09:09.382,00:09:13.094,"Well, he was really embarrassed, but everything’s– everything’s fine now."
00:09:13.178,00:09:15.888,What’d you say?
00:09:13.178,00:09:19.225,"Well, you know, - I kinda promised him we’d keep everything between us. - Mm-hmm."
00:09:23.021,00:09:25.439,"- Oh, God, really? - Yeah."
00:09:25.523,00:09:28.067,That actually makes me feel kinda bad.
00:09:28.151,00:09:33.948,"Well, you’re probably just feeling a little tense from all this."
00:09:34.032,00:09:36.909,I know I am.
00:09:36.993,00:09:39.329,You know what might help the situation?
00:09:41.456,00:09:43.458,Really? Right now?
00:09:45.877,00:09:49.422,I meant going out for a few pizzas.
00:09:49.506,00:09:52.842,Where’s your mind?
00:09:59.724,00:10:02.268,We can’t help you if you won’t come out.
00:10:06.022,00:10:08.691,What’d he say?
00:10:08.775,00:10:11.736,"Come on. The show starts in a half hour, and we still have to pick up Manny."
00:10:11.820,00:10:13.446,Can we just– Come on. Move this thing along!
00:10:13.530,00:10:15.448,"Okay, this man is in crisis."
00:10:15.532,00:10:19.994,He could have a family health issue or a personal health issue or a financial matter.
00:10:20.078,00:10:22.455,Stop. You’re getting all this from something house something?
00:10:22.539,00:10:25.916,"Let’s just call Gloria and have her deal with it, okay?"
00:10:26.000,00:10:28.043,"It is a human being, Mitchell."
00:10:28.127,00:10:30.045,Named Caesar Salad.
00:10:33.383,00:10:36.093,It’s like you’re incapable of hearing anyone’s sad story...
00:10:36.177,00:10:38.095,without making it your job to fix it.
00:10:38.179,00:10:42.141,"And then, my needs– my needs come second."
00:10:42.225,00:10:44.101,are a puppet show.
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.562,This man could have lost his brother in a cable car accident.
00:10:48.982,00:10:50.900,"Okay, fine. If it’ll prove to you..."
00:10:50.984,00:10:55.571,"that I’m not the obsessive helpaholic that you make me out to be, let’s go to the puppet show."
00:10:55.655,00:10:58.491,- Cam. - Let’s go.
00:10:58.575,00:11:01.994,Ay. ¿Dónde está mi novio? Su camión está parqueado afuera.
00:11:02.078,00:11:05.122,- I think this has something to do with the gardener. - You think?
00:11:05.206,00:11:09.168,"- Just down the hall to the right. - Ay. Gracias, gracias."
00:11:09.252,00:11:11.921,Perdón.
00:11:12.005,00:11:14.173,"- Okay, let’s go. - No, please."
00:11:14.257,00:11:16.926,I know it’s killing you not to get back there in the middle of that.
00:11:17.010,00:11:20.554,"Oh, no, no, no, no. We are going. These folks can find their own way out."
00:11:20.638,00:11:24.934,And now you’ll know that I’m not a manic Mother Teresa out there collecting lost souls.
00:11:25.018,00:11:27.020,"Oh, come on."
00:11:34.110,00:11:36.946,- Is Manny ready? - Didn’t you get the message? He’s not going.
00:11:37.030,00:11:41.033,"- What? - Ah, some mandatory cleanup at school."
00:11:41.117,00:11:44.370,"- What’s the real reason? - It’s a puppet show, Mitch."
00:11:44.454,00:11:47.790,"Perfect. All right, it’s just you and me then, Lily."
00:11:47.874,00:11:51.252,How’s the little fortune cookie?
00:11:54.797,00:11:57.132,"Because of him, I have a house full of Latinos."
00:12:00.720,00:12:03.389,He just can’t say no to anybody who needs help.
00:12:03.473,00:12:06.183,And why do you have to always add the word gay where it doesn’t belong?
00:12:09.354,00:12:11.272,"Okay, Dad, good talk. See you later."
00:12:11.356,00:12:14.650,"Come on, I didn’t mean it. Hey, I didn’t mean it. I’m a little cranky."
00:12:21.991,00:12:26.078,"Get rid of the boat. Get rid of the motorcycle. You know, I liked those things."
00:12:26.162,00:12:28.456,Why do you have to get rid of it then?
00:12:29.499,00:12:32.251,"You know, actually, I don’t."
00:12:32.335,00:12:35.754,"Anyway, I’m gluing his hand on over here. His hand came off."
00:12:35.838,00:12:39.049,"Rough day, Dad. Your hot, young wife doesn’t like your doll."
00:12:39.133,00:12:42.761,"Yeah, unlike your big problem, My boyfriend’s too nice to people."
00:12:42.845,00:12:45.222,"No, see– mmm– that’s not all it is."
00:12:45.306,00:12:49.435,He helps animals. He’s always volunteering for things. Trust me.
00:12:49.519,00:12:51.437,It-It’s worse than it sounds.
00:12:54.190,00:12:57.693,"Hell, I’m probably fighting with your mom more than I’m fighting with Gloria on this thing."
00:12:57.777,00:13:00.654,A bird fell out of a tree and he fed it with an eyedropper.
00:13:06.703,00:13:10.539,Your mom and I were perfect on paper and you know how that ended.
00:13:10.623,00:13:14.501,What I got now is a lot better.
00:13:14.585,00:13:18.130,"Sure, people look at us sometimes. And sometimes even I can’t believe we’re together."
00:13:21.050,00:13:24.137,there’s no one I’d rather come home to.
00:13:27.140,00:13:30.560,You mean Gloria.
00:13:32.145,00:13:34.063,Who else?
00:13:37.900,00:13:40.403,"See you, kid."
00:13:41.904,00:13:44.323,Did you draw on my poster?
00:13:44.407,00:13:48.494,"Yeah, I did. Maybe you’ll think about that the next time you read my journal."
00:13:56.586,00:14:00.506,"That’s Maya Angelou, you idiot."
00:14:00.590,00:14:02.883,"Oh, sorry. I don’t follow the WNBA."
00:14:02.967,00:14:08.347,"You know what? This is the worst thing you’ve ever done, and I’ll never forgive you!"
00:14:08.431,00:14:10.599,You started it!
00:14:10.683,00:14:14.436,What are you looking at?
00:14:10.683,00:14:16.939,"Well, I just heard– I was the one who read Haley’s diary."
00:14:17.023,00:14:19.567,I was playing on her computer and it just opened.
00:14:21.611,00:14:25.740,"Okay, I opened it. But I didn’t mean for anyone to fight."
00:14:26.783,00:14:29.952,"Oh, home already. Mitchell, hi. Hi."
00:14:33.039,00:14:38.752,"No. You know, I was never gonna enjoy the show without you, so– Oh. But you were so excited to take Lily to see the Russian marionettes."
00:14:38.836,00:14:40.504,"Oh, she’s probably a little young anyway."
00:14:40.588,00:14:43.090,We can just prop her in front of the dryer for a half hour.
00:14:43.174,00:14:50.764,"Listen, Cam, I-I love that you try and help the world, and I’m very lucky to have you in my life."
00:14:50.848,00:14:53.308,How’d everything work out with the gardener?
00:14:53.392,00:14:55.644,"Turned out it was his wedding day, and he was a little nervous."
00:14:55.728,00:14:58.063,Oh– But you know what? There’s no need to apologize.
00:14:59.816,00:15:02.109,"No, no. Sometimes I take things too far."
00:15:02.193,00:15:05.947,"Okay. If that ever happens, I will let you know."
00:15:09.867,00:15:13.287,Is there a reason I can’t go inside?
00:15:17.875,00:15:20.711,La puedes besar.
00:15:27.385,00:15:31.096,"- Mom, can I talk to you? - Sure, honey. What’s going on?"
00:15:31.180,00:15:33.932,I feel bad about something I did.
00:15:34.016,00:15:37.519,"Oh, sweetie. Is this about the computer?"
00:15:37.603,00:15:39.938,Yeah.
00:15:40.022,00:15:43.192,Yeah. It was just so freaky.
00:15:43.276,00:15:45.652,I couldn’t stop looking.
00:15:45.736,00:15:49.156,But the important thing is you did stop looking.
00:15:49.240,00:15:51.283,After about an hour.
00:15:56.205,00:15:58.082,Some parts were funny.
00:16:00.710,00:16:04.088,"Well, I hope you realize that some of those parts weren’t real."
00:16:05.965,00:16:08.467,"But they can be totally real, right?"
00:16:08.551,00:16:11.053,Like Anne Frank’s?
00:16:11.137,00:16:13.055,All I know is it really made me wonder about Haley.
00:16:13.139,00:16:16.809,"That’s disturbing, sweetie. Why Haley?"
00:16:20.563,00:16:22.231,I’m sorry! I couldn’t help it.
00:16:22.315,00:16:23.982,Wait. Haley’s journal too?
00:16:24.066,00:16:26.360,"Luke, you are now banned from the computer."
00:16:26.444,00:16:28.070,What happened? Who’s in trouble?
00:16:28.154,00:16:30.781,- Luke read my journal! - I told you it wasn’t me!
00:16:30.865,00:16:33.075,"- You know, I’m gonna kill you. - Haley, calm down."
00:16:37.955,00:16:39.456,You read it too?
00:16:39.540,00:16:41.333,Am I the only one who hasn’t read it?
00:16:41.417,00:16:44.336,I was looking through the computers in the house for pornography.
00:16:44.420,00:16:48.006,- Sick. - Not for me. I wanted to see what you guys are looking at.
00:16:48.090,00:16:49.842,So you’re violating our privacy.
00:16:49.926,00:16:51.593,When I find out that my children...
00:16:51.677,00:16:54.930,"are looking at a naked picture online, they don’t have any privacy."
00:16:55.014,00:16:57.766,- Who was looking at naked pictures? - That doesn’t matter.
00:16:59.644,00:17:02.521,Wasn’t me. That’s gross. I’m 10!
00:17:02.605,00:17:04.273,Wait a minute.
00:17:04.357,00:17:06.192,"If it wasn’t you, who was it?"
00:17:07.318,00:17:08.861,Mangia!
00:17:11.864,00:17:13.657,"Rosa, thank you for coming."
00:17:13.741,00:17:16.952,"Carlos, let me know how it works out with that dentist. Victor, you owe me a dance."
00:17:19.038,00:17:22.249,"And without Mitchell, I would just keep giving and giving and giving."
00:17:22.333,00:17:27.754,I’m like a big runaway charity truck and Mitchell is my off-ramp full of safety gravel.
00:17:27.838,00:17:31.717,He knows how to say no. He always can put himself first.
00:17:31.801,00:17:40.476,"He certainly can turn his back on someone suffering. Um– No, really. Keep going."
00:17:41.727,00:17:44.771,- He– - Don’t keep going!
00:17:44.855,00:17:47.608,"Muchas gracias. Hey, good-bye."
00:17:51.862,00:17:55.282,"- Oh, God. Dad. - Looks like I missed the party, huh?"
00:17:55.366,00:17:57.034,What is– What is that doing here?
00:17:57.118,00:18:00.329,He is a gift for you and Cam.
00:18:00.413,00:18:03.749,He lost his monocle on the drive. Head was out the window.
00:18:08.921,00:18:11.506,Let’s give him a chance.
00:18:11.590,00:18:13.508,You said that somebody was getting married?
00:18:13.592,00:18:17.013,"Gloria, there you are. I’ve got good news."
00:18:21.684,00:18:23.686,What’s the matter?
00:18:26.314,00:18:29.483,Honey? Hey.
00:18:29.567,00:18:31.693,I’m really sorry.
00:18:31.777,00:18:34.279,That picture was just something that someone sent me.
00:18:34.363,00:18:37.783,Doesn’t matter who. Gil Thorpe.
00:18:37.867,00:18:41.453,"Anyway, I don’t do that stuff."
00:18:41.537,00:18:45.624,"You’re all the porn I need. That’s– Uh– Honey, it’s fine."
00:18:45.708,00:18:48.336,It’s fine. Mmm.
00:18:49.795,00:18:51.756,"Now, it’s fine."
00:18:55.217,00:18:58.470,I was just upset when I thought it was Luke.
00:18:58.554,00:19:01.682,"Haley, honey, I really wish you would give me a hand with all this laundry."
00:19:01.766,00:19:08.814,"You never, ever– Alex has never really been a kid."
00:19:08.898,00:19:11.566,But Luke is my baby.
00:19:11.650,00:19:16.822,"Is it really too much to ask that he stay a sweet, innocent kid..."
00:19:16.906,00:19:18.907,forever?
00:19:23.329,00:19:26.957,"Hey, buddy. Um– Here. Sorry."
00:19:27.041,00:19:28.959,We’ll dribble later.
00:19:29.043,00:19:32.838,"Um, I just, uh– I just want to say I’m sorry."
00:19:36.425,00:19:41.263,"Your mom sort of thought it was yours and I should have stopped it, but I didn’t."
00:19:41.347,00:19:43.224,So what was the picture of?
00:19:44.642,00:19:49.229,"Well, it was a woman on a tractor and she had her shirt off."
00:19:49.313,00:19:52.274,Was it hot?
00:19:54.485,00:20:03.285,"Um, this particular woman– Well, my tastes do run to the curvy, and the cowboy hat did not hurt one bit."
00:20:06.789,00:20:09.125,Yeah.
00:20:10.418,00:20:13.587,"Well, this is good. This is good."
00:20:16.132,00:20:19.552,And I think now you can feel safe talking to me about whatever.
00:20:32.231,00:20:37.903,"Sadly, I’ve been summarily dismissed from the employ of Masters Cameron and Mitchell."
00:20:37.987,00:20:42.282,"The former being an utter delight, and the latter being a humorless snoot."
00:20:42.366,00:20:44.576,Just come on. Get him in the car. The thrift shop’s closing.
00:20:44.660,00:20:46.995,What is this exciting thrift shop you speak of?
00:20:47.079,00:20:49.831,Many of my relatives were taken out of their homes...
00:20:49.915,00:20:55.462,to be released into the green pastures in their maturity– Did you just say matoority?
00:20:55.546,00:20:57.464,I regret nothing!
00:20:57.548,00:20:59.674,I’ll pay you. I’m a comfortable man.
00:20:59.758,00:21:01.927,I’ve been stealing from your father for days.
00:21:02.011,00:21:06.681,"Oh, is there any better feeling in the world than having your ears flap in the wind?"
00:21:06.765,00:21:09.142,You know what? Get out.
00:21:09.226,00:21:11.645,"No, not you, Barkley. Cameron, out."
00:00:06.757,00:00:10.844,"That’s what I believe anyway, and I will till the day I die."
00:00:10.928,00:00:14.472,You do realize you’re proving the exact opposite of your point?
00:00:14.556,00:00:18.184,See? She’s changed. She used to be very supportive of me.
00:00:25.525,00:00:28.027,- Ow! Ow! Why is it so loud? - My ears are bleeding!
00:00:28.111,00:00:30.530,Why is it so loud?
00:00:30.614,00:00:34.409,I just installed a sweet home theater system in the family room.
00:00:35.619,00:00:38.371,"The, um– The trouble is Claire struggles..."
00:00:38.455,00:00:40.874,with technology of any kind.
00:00:40.958,00:00:44.253,"I mean, remotes, cell phones, computers."
00:00:48.674,00:00:51.051,"Oh, hey, Dylan."
00:00:52.302,00:00:55.263,"You know I can see you, right?"
00:00:57.474,00:00:59.809,Haley’s just in the bathroom. She’ll be back in just a minute.
00:00:59.893,00:01:01.769,Thank you.
00:01:01.853,00:01:04.063,Where were you pointing it?
00:01:06.149,00:01:09.110,"Honey– Uh, no. I’m sorry. It’s-It’s a home theater."
00:01:09.194,00:01:12.655,"What, so I can’t point it at the TV when I want to watch the TV?"
00:01:12.739,00:01:15.909,No. You point it at the receiver.
00:01:15.993,00:01:19.954,"Okay, imagine our home theater system is a human body."
00:01:20.038,00:01:22.916,So then the receiver is the brain.
00:01:23.000,00:01:25.669,The TV is the face.
00:01:30.090,00:01:32.383,His heart– boom! Quadruple bypass.
00:01:32.467,00:01:34.427,Blown a valve.
00:01:34.511,00:01:36.763,- Hey. There he is. - What a coinkydink.
00:01:36.847,00:01:39.265,I was just getting some flowers for Gloria for babysitting Lily.
00:01:39.349,00:01:41.267,You want me to take ’em to her?
00:01:41.351,00:01:43.978,"I would, but I have the most hilarious card for her at home."
00:01:44.062,00:01:47.190,It’s– It’s a hunky Antonio Banderas type in silk boxers.
00:01:47.274,00:01:53.363,"And on the inside, it says, Thank you for last noche, but I can’t find my pantalones."
00:01:56.658,00:01:58.618,"I’m not doing it justice, really."
00:01:58.702,00:02:01.871,"Hi. I’m Cameron. Oh, geez. I’m sorry. Guys, this is Cameron."
00:02:05.542,00:02:08.711,"This is, uh, Scotty, Dale, Hugo and Shorty."
00:02:17.387,00:02:20.474,- ¡Ay! So handsome! - Thank you.
00:02:22.225,00:02:25.645,"Manny, are you wearing aftershave? Yes, for my date."
00:02:25.729,00:02:28.356,This will be the first time she will ever smell me.
00:02:28.440,00:02:32.193,Her name is Whitney. I met her in an online book club.
00:02:32.277,00:02:34.195,We both like vampire fiction...
00:02:34.279,00:02:36.239,and the romance of eternal life.
00:02:36.323,00:02:38.992,I think it’s adorable that Manny has a date.
00:02:39.076,00:02:43.371,He even picked out the lunch menu– grilled-cheese sandwich and tomato soup.
00:02:43.455,00:02:46.374,"Tomato soup because, you know, the tomato soup is like the blood."
00:02:48.794,00:02:53.464,"And then he wants me to take them out for ice cream, well, because Manny likes ice cream."
00:02:56.426,00:02:58.678,"If this goes well, you don’t need to stick around."
00:02:58.762,00:03:00.430,Vamos.
00:03:04.101,00:03:07.729,Hi. I’m Whitney. I’m here for Manny.
00:03:24.454,00:03:27.540,"Sorry, sweetie. Sorry, Daddy."
00:03:27.624,00:03:29.625,We were just– Me and Lily were just using the time...
00:03:29.709,00:03:31.627,to figure out how to use the car’s voice-command thingy.
00:03:31.711,00:03:33.379,Oh.
00:03:33.463,00:03:37.383,CD player. Next track.
00:03:37.467,00:03:39.385,No.
00:03:45.809,00:03:48.144,Damn it.
00:03:48.228,00:03:50.146,It’s a good thing Lily doesn’t have an ejector seat.
00:03:50.230,00:03:53.816,"Oh, guess what. I ran into your dad and some of his friends."
00:03:53.900,00:03:56.235,"Oh, really?"
00:03:56.319,00:03:59.614,"He, uh– He referred to me as a friend of my son."
00:03:59.698,00:04:02.492,Seriously?
00:04:02.576,00:04:05.328,That’s a little disrespectful to you.
00:04:05.412,00:04:08.247,I wasn’t offended by it.
00:04:11.751,00:04:13.669,I’ve heard him call Phil a lot worse.
00:04:13.753,00:04:15.797,Just let it pass. I should have never said anything.
00:04:15.881,00:04:18.174,I’m not letting it pass. He needs to know that’s not okay.
00:04:18.258,00:04:20.468,"And if he doesn’t like it, he knows where he can go."
00:04:20.552,00:04:23.054,Enter destination.
00:04:23.138,00:04:26.140,Mexican food.
00:04:26.224,00:04:28.643,I came out of the closet in my mid-20s.
00:04:28.727,00:04:31.104,I had to actually come out to my dad three times...
00:04:31.188,00:04:33.439,before he finally acknowledged it.
00:04:33.523,00:04:42.115,"I’m not sure if maybe he was hoping he heard it wrong, And my parents, they always just knew."
00:04:42.199,00:04:44.242,My mother says labor with me took 36 hours...
00:04:44.326,00:04:47.328,because I came out of the womb like this– Hello!
00:04:47.412,00:04:49.455,"Hey, Dad."
00:04:51.541,00:04:53.584,"Hey, Mitch, how they hangin’? Hey, Mitch."
00:04:53.668,00:04:55.586,"Hey, hey, hey. That’s a great coat."
00:04:55.670,00:04:57.964,Where’d you get that?
00:04:58.048,00:05:01.676,"Really? What is it– suede, microsuede?"
00:04:58.048,00:05:04.387,"Um– Some kind of lambskin? It’s very soft, you know."
00:05:04.471,00:05:05.889,Thank you.
00:05:07.224,00:05:08.724,Huh.
00:05:08.808,00:05:11.144,"- Uh, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:05:11.228,00:05:13.896,Thanks. Good seeing you.
00:05:13.980,00:05:16.023,What’s the matter?
00:05:18.235,00:05:21.654,That’s why you came here?
00:05:21.738,00:05:24.407,Cam and I have been together for five years. We– We have a daughter.
00:05:24.491,00:05:26.492,Look at these guys.
00:05:26.576,00:05:28.536,They look like they came out of the 1800s.
00:05:28.620,00:05:31.539,"You see Hugo over there? After lunch, he ordered a Sanka."
00:05:31.623,00:05:34.208,"No, they’re not the ones that are uncomfortable with this. You are."
00:05:34.292,00:05:36.752,You’ve never been completely accepting of me.
00:05:36.836,00:05:39.505,"And now that I have a family, it’s getting a little old."
00:05:41.591,00:05:44.802,Why create an awkward situation? That’s all I’m saying.
00:05:53.103,00:05:56.314,"My gaydar is never wrong, and it is pinging like we’re at a bathhouse."
00:05:56.398,00:05:58.524,What are you talking about– gay? The guy used to be married.
00:06:02.237,00:06:05.740,You know what? Listen. You couldn’t be more wrong about this.
00:06:05.824,00:06:08.242,"No, Dad. You could not be more wrong– about a lot of things."
00:06:13.290,00:06:15.292,Ping!
00:06:22.173,00:06:25.426,Phil Dunphy.
00:06:25.510,00:06:27.678,"Hey. Listen, I’ve got a bunch of moms over here..."
00:06:27.762,00:06:32.225,"who wanna watch the talent show DVD, and I can’t get the sound to work."
00:06:32.309,00:06:34.310,Is there a picture?
00:06:40.191,00:06:42.151,I have a theory that Phil installs...
00:06:43.987,00:06:47.240,just so he has an excuse to talk to me like a child.
00:07:07.010,00:07:09.929,He just seemed so mature online.
00:07:10.013,00:07:13.432,How could I be so stupid?
00:07:16.728,00:07:20.189,"I mean, what kind of 11-year-old talks like that?"
00:07:20.273,00:07:23.109,Manny’s an old soul.
00:07:23.193,00:07:25.653,Here. Use my handkerchief.
00:07:25.737,00:07:27.655,You see what I mean?
00:07:27.739,00:07:29.865,I’ll just be alone for the rest of my life.
00:07:29.949,00:07:32.827,And that’s okay.
00:07:32.911,00:07:35.746,"In my country, there’s a saying that means..."
00:07:35.830,00:07:38.499,Love is just around the corner.
00:07:38.583,00:07:42.044,I come from a neighborhood with a lot of prostitutes.
00:07:42.128,00:07:45.881,"Maybe for you. I mean, men must throw themselves at you every day."
00:07:45.965,00:07:52.138,They’ll do the same for you if you just– Just what? Put out?
00:07:48.551,00:07:55.808,"No. Just– Like, the lipstick, the hair, push-up bra. You know."
00:07:59.145,00:08:02.273,"Ay, believe me, this takes a lot of work."
00:08:02.357,00:08:04.358,You just need to find your inner beauty.
00:08:04.442,00:08:07.778,It’s hiding beneath a mask of insecurity.
00:08:07.862,00:08:09.822,"Okay, he’s starting to freak me out."
00:08:09.906,00:08:11.741,"Manny, go play."
00:08:15.912,00:08:17.913,"Mitchell, how do these look to you?"
00:08:17.997,00:08:20.082,Like they’re dying.
00:08:20.166,00:08:23.294,"I said something to the florist. He said, Don’t worry about it. They’re gonna come back."
00:08:23.378,00:08:25.504,They’re not coming back. They’ve crossed to the other side.
00:08:27.590,00:08:29.508,You’re completely bothered by the flowers.
00:08:29.592,00:08:34.513,"But when my father introduces you as a friend of my son, doesn’t faze you in the least."
00:08:34.597,00:08:36.265,Because the florist played me for a fool.
00:08:36.349,00:08:38.476,Your dad didn’t mean any harm. He’s just being who he is.
00:08:38.560,00:08:47.193,"When I was back East in law school, my dad used to call me every Saturday at 6:00 p.m., before people would go out, just to, you know, check in, catch up."
00:09:03.126,00:09:05.211,I’m not crying.
00:09:08.339,00:09:11.008,This is Whitney. We’re giving her a makeover.
00:09:11.092,00:09:13.678,Hi. You have such a nice family...
00:09:13.762,00:09:16.305,and a really beautiful house.
00:09:16.389,00:09:19.058,- Thanks. You two know each other how? - She’s my date.
00:09:19.142,00:09:21.727,Of course she is. I’ll be in here.
00:09:24.981,00:09:27.066,I’m sorry this didn’t turn out like you wanted.
00:09:27.150,00:09:29.026,That’s okay.
00:09:29.110,00:09:31.404,Probably didn’t turn out how you wanted it either.
00:09:31.488,00:09:37.618,"I’ll tell you what. If neither of us is with anybody in 10 years, how about you and me give it a shot?"
00:09:40.538,00:09:42.248,But maybe.
00:09:42.332,00:09:44.125,How was your lunch with the boys?
00:09:46.503,00:09:50.589,You’re not gonna believe this. Mitchell says Shorty’s gay. Shorty?
00:09:50.673,00:09:53.300,"Yeah, I believe it."
00:09:53.384,00:09:57.638,"Well, he’s a great dresser, a great dancer."
00:09:57.722,00:10:00.808,He’s the only one of your friends that never hits on me.
00:10:00.892,00:10:02.601,"Yes, all the time, but don’t worry."
00:10:02.685,00:10:04.603,They’re a bunch of harmless old men.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.605,They’re my age.
00:10:09.526,00:10:11.777,"Jay, I think you should talk to him."
00:10:15.532,00:10:17.450,We’re guys. We don’t open up.
00:10:17.534,00:10:22.204,"We talk about sports and cars, getting up in the middle of the night to pee."
00:10:22.288,00:10:26.625,I’m sure you made it very easy for Mitch to come out of the closet.
00:10:26.709,00:10:29.546,Yeah.
00:10:30.880,00:10:32.965,Because I care about people.
00:10:33.049,00:10:36.552,Because I want to help them change their lives.
00:10:36.636,00:10:39.597,"Jay, I’m hinting that you should call your friend, okay?"
00:10:39.681,00:10:41.683,Yes. I’m getting that.
00:10:44.394,00:10:46.061,"Hey, hey! Daddy in the hizzouse!"
00:10:58.241,00:11:01.744,"Because I lost my temper, and it didn’t work. Therefore, it’s useless."
00:11:01.828,00:11:05.664,"Well, honey, when it comes to anything electronic, you’re not exactly the best student."
00:11:05.748,00:11:07.666,I am very smart.
00:11:07.750,00:11:10.211,I had a 4.0 in college. How about you?
00:11:10.295,00:11:13.172,I was almost that despite my substantial time commitment to cheerleading.
00:11:13.256,00:11:15.925,I thought we agreed not to bring up the cheerleading.
00:11:16.009,00:11:18.594,Cheerleading in my college was cool.
00:11:18.678,00:11:24.601,"The football players were so jealous, they wouldn’t even let me and my buddies– Trevor, Scotty and Ling– go to their parties."
00:11:25.810,00:11:29.855,"Seriously, Claire, you owe me an apology for breaking that."
00:11:29.939,00:11:34.276,"Okay. Phil, I apologize for breaking the world’s worst remote..."
00:11:34.360,00:11:35.945,that you bought... stupidly.
00:11:36.029,00:11:41.200,"Excuse me, but the experts at CNET.com rated it the best remote."
00:11:41.284,00:11:43.410,They gave it three and a half mice.
00:11:43.494,00:11:46.247,Wow. I have an idea. Let’s invite the gang from CNET over...
00:11:46.331,00:11:49.375,"and your old buddies from cheerleading, and we can have a nerd party."
00:11:49.459,00:11:52.461,Ling is not a nerd. He built his own helicopter.
00:11:52.545,00:11:55.005,"And if he was alive today– Sweet pea, let’s not talk about Ling."
00:11:55.089,00:11:56.925,It upsets you too much.
00:11:58.927,00:12:00.886,You know what I’m gonna do?
00:12:00.970,00:12:03.222,I’m gonna buy a new remote– the same remote.
00:12:03.306,00:12:07.893,"And just to prove how wrong you are, I’m gonna teach our dumbest kid how to use it in 20 minutes or less."
00:12:07.977,00:12:10.396,Who’s our dumbest kid?
00:12:10.480,00:12:13.566,"Luke? No, Luke understands electronics."
00:12:14.734,00:12:15.943,No.
00:12:16.027,00:12:18.904,"Teach Haley to use the remote, and then I’ll apologize."
00:12:18.988,00:12:20.656,Haley?
00:12:20.740,00:12:22.241,Come on!
00:12:22.325,00:12:24.285,"Hey, Shorty, it’s me."
00:12:24.369,00:12:27.037,I was thinking of heading over to the driving range and hitting a few balls.
00:12:27.121,00:12:30.124,You want to join me?
00:12:30.208,00:12:32.751,I don’t know. Wear– Wear whatever you want.
00:12:35.421,00:12:37.339,What?
00:12:37.423,00:12:39.758,They look so much better! This is a disaster.
00:12:41.344,00:12:44.889,You don’t understand. I demanded that they come exchange them.
00:12:44.973,00:12:46.891,I got all medieval on the florist.
00:12:49.352,00:12:51.854,"You said you were displeased, but that’s hardly going medieval."
00:12:59.278,00:13:01.322,"Well, that seems a little crazy, doesn’t it?"
00:13:03.533,00:13:05.951,"Oh, no! That’s the florist."
00:13:06.035,00:13:08.621,Relax. Just take them out. I’ll get the door. He’ll never know the difference.
00:13:10.707,00:13:12.625,Hi.
00:13:12.709,00:13:15.628,- Yes. Come on in. He’s over there with the flowers. - Hello.
00:13:15.712,00:13:18.839,"I don’t know what happened. They just, uh, somehow lost their vigor."
00:13:18.923,00:13:21.175,- They were like this when we came home. - Cam. Cam.
00:13:23.302,00:13:25.638,"Oh, my God! Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!"
00:13:28.224,00:13:30.685,Look at that. Two things flaming at once.
00:13:37.066,00:13:38.567,Damn it!
00:13:38.651,00:13:40.361,You know what the problem is.
00:13:40.445,00:13:42.363,You’re not moving your hips. They’re frozen.
00:13:42.447,00:13:44.740,"Yeah, your hips. They’re frozen. Here, let me show you."
00:13:44.824,00:13:47.576,"No, it’s okay. All right, Shorty."
00:13:54.917,00:13:58.462,"That’s it. If you don’t relax, you’re never gonna get that shaft where it belongs."
00:13:58.546,00:14:00.464,"Hey, you know what? How about a coffee?"
00:14:00.548,00:14:02.508,Let’s get a coffee. Sure.
00:14:05.386,00:14:07.304,Where is that? It’s just to the right. To the right.
00:14:10.058,00:14:12.017,"Honey, you gotta focus. We’ve only got 20 minutes."
00:14:14.103,00:14:17.606,"Dad, this is stupid. I watch TV on my computer. Why do I have to learn this?"
00:14:17.690,00:14:19.692,Because your mom doesn’t think you can.
00:14:19.776,00:14:21.902,Nobody can.
00:14:21.986,00:14:24.196,Listen to me.
00:14:24.280,00:14:26.448,I know this seems impossible.
00:14:26.532,00:14:30.160,But this is for all those times that Mom told you she was right...
00:14:30.244,00:14:32.163,and you knew she was wrong.
00:14:35.124,00:14:38.711,I’ll do it.
00:14:38.795,00:14:41.088,"You know, that guy’s got a beautiful stroke."
00:14:41.172,00:14:44.049,Look at his pants– no pleats. I like pants like that.
00:14:44.133,00:14:46.469,You think I can get away with something like that?
00:14:47.887,00:14:51.098,"Listen, Shorty, uh, we know each other a long time, right?"
00:14:51.182,00:14:53.225,"What, 30 years?"
00:14:57.480,00:14:59.482,that’s maybe causing you a lot of anguish.
00:15:01.442,00:15:03.402,"You heard something, right?"
00:15:03.486,00:15:06.656,"Well, I had the same situation with my son, Mitchell."
00:15:10.326,00:15:17.625,"And, uh, I just want you to know that you can open up to me, that I’m gonna do all I can to help you."
00:15:23.172,00:15:26.008,I never said this out loud before to anyone.
00:15:28.886,00:15:38.020,"It’s just that, Jay, you see, I’m, uh– I’m– Go ahead. Yeah. Go ahead."
00:15:40.439,00:15:43.567,"I owe a bookie 20 G’s, and he’s a serious guy."
00:15:43.651,00:15:47.029,And you offering to give me the dough– This is beautiful.
00:15:49.782,00:15:51.867,What are you talkin’ about– gay?
00:15:51.951,00:15:54.036,I’m not gay. Where’d you get gay?
00:15:54.120,00:15:56.705,"Come on. I mean, you’re always talking about clothes and everything, right?"
00:15:56.789,00:16:00.084,My father was a tailor. I like clothes. So what?
00:16:00.168,00:16:02.127,Are you calling my father gay?
00:16:02.211,00:16:05.047,My father landed on Normandy to save your ass.
00:16:05.131,00:16:09.552,"You know, if you weren’t lending me 20 G’s, I’d knock you out right now."
00:16:12.972,00:16:14.890,Take a check?
00:16:14.974,00:16:16.893,Cash would be better.
00:16:18.060,00:16:21.188,Haley. You ready?
00:16:21.272,00:16:23.274,Let’s do this.
00:16:24.317,00:16:26.401,Turn on the TV.
00:16:29.071,00:16:30.989,it turned gray and then green. Mute it.
00:16:34.577,00:16:36.662,Sixty-five dollars.
00:16:36.746,00:16:40.749,-Put on a DVD. -Hairdresser Frederick Longmire denies he’s responsible.
00:16:40.833,00:16:43.210,- Skip forward. - Wait.
00:16:43.294,00:16:45.504,Um.
00:16:52.678,00:16:55.848,Face!
00:16:55.932,00:16:57.558,Let’s see what happens to little Haley...
00:16:57.642,00:17:00.727,when I do... this.
00:17:00.811,00:17:03.522,"Ho, ho, ho. Ho! Face."
00:17:03.606,00:17:05.858,"Dad, wh– What do I do?"
00:17:05.942,00:17:08.610,Don’t panic. We went through this. Just– Just think.
00:17:08.694,00:17:10.737,Give up. Give up. Admit defeat.
00:17:10.821,00:17:13.782,"Okay. Uh, let’s see."
00:17:13.866,00:17:17.536,You put the remote on to TV mode...
00:17:17.620,00:17:19.788,and then press Input...
00:17:19.872,00:17:29.965,till you get HDMI 1 and– - I did it! - She did it!
00:17:33.719,00:17:35.637,Fine. You proved your point.
00:17:35.721,00:17:37.723,Everybody in this house is smarter than me.
00:17:37.807,00:17:39.725,"No, honey, you’re missing the point."
00:17:39.809,00:17:42.269,I taught Haley how to use the remote in 20 minutes.
00:17:42.353,00:17:44.313,So think how fast you can learn it.
00:17:44.397,00:17:46.106,What’s that supposed to mean?
00:17:46.190,00:17:47.900,See what I’m saying?
00:18:00.663,00:18:03.373,I made that up to mess with you for dissing Cam.
00:18:03.457,00:18:06.251,"What? That cost me 20,000 bucks."
00:18:13.426,00:18:15.928,Right after one of the stranger golf lessons of my life.
00:18:16.012,00:18:21.350,"Turns out what he is is a lousy gambler, and now I’m the one on the hook for it."
00:18:23.936,00:18:26.688,Then why are you smiling?
00:18:26.772,00:18:30.067,And you’re growing.
00:18:30.151,00:18:32.110,Don’t you see how hard this is for me?
00:18:32.194,00:18:34.905,"See, I used to be just like one of those guys. Now look at me."
00:18:34.989,00:18:36.990,I got a house looks like Little Colombia.
00:18:37.074,00:18:39.034,I got a gay son and a Chinese granddaughter.
00:18:39.118,00:18:41.870,- Vietnamese. - Only you would know the difference.
00:18:41.954,00:18:44.623,"Don’t worry, Dad. Not growing too much."
00:18:46.375,00:18:49.294,Don’t be.
00:18:52.548,00:18:56.176,What do you think?
00:18:56.260,00:18:59.304,Really?
00:19:01.766,00:19:03.684,I don’t know about that.
00:19:03.768,00:19:07.479,Cameron!
00:19:03.768,00:19:09.564,"Hi. Sorry for the pop over, but I just wanted to bring you these..."
00:19:11.650,00:19:13.568,Oh!
00:19:13.652,00:19:15.612,¡Gracias! You didn’t need to do that.
00:19:15.696,00:19:17.614,You know I love Lily.
00:19:17.698,00:19:19.616,Come in. Say hello.
00:19:19.700,00:19:21.243,"Hey, Cam."
00:19:21.327,00:19:23.745,"Manny, how are you?"
00:19:23.829,00:19:26.581,"Whitney, this is Cameron."
00:19:26.665,00:19:28.583,That is a spectacular dress.
00:19:32.922,00:19:34.756,It’s like Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were.
00:19:34.840,00:19:37.218,One of my favorites.
00:19:38.719,00:19:41.179,"Okay, who is reading The Forevers?"
00:19:41.263,00:19:42.764,I am.
00:19:42.848,00:19:45.684,I am so obsessed with this whole vampire thing right now.
00:19:45.768,00:19:47.686,Me too.
00:19:47.770,00:19:50.689,I just met the sweetest guy named Cameron.
00:19:50.773,00:19:53.150,I think he might be the one.
00:19:55.778,00:20:00.824,"People are who they are– give or take, yeah, 15%."
00:20:00.908,00:20:04.244,That’s how much people can change if they really want to.
00:20:04.328,00:20:07.081,"Well, I’ll see you when I see you."
00:20:04.328,00:20:21.928,"Yeah, thanks for– What?"
00:20:22.012,00:20:25.265,Now? Why can’t Dad teach you?
00:20:25.349,00:20:27.518,Because we’re married.
00:20:28.978,00:20:34.524,Whether it’s for themselves or for the people they love– That way. Yeah.
00:20:34.608,00:20:36.568,And then press– Mmm! I got it.
00:20:36.652,00:20:40.113,"Yeah. Yeah, 15%."
00:20:42.158,00:20:43.658,But you know what?
00:20:43.742,00:20:47.329,Sometimes that’s just enough.
00:20:50.416,00:20:52.376,"All right, I’ll see you guys next week, huh?"
00:20:52.460,00:20:54.086,Jay. Jay.
00:20:56.380,00:20:59.591,"Listen, I wanna thank you for, you know, helping me out with that jam."
00:20:59.675,00:21:02.511,It was nothin’.
00:21:02.595,00:21:04.262,You didn’t have to do that.
00:21:04.346,00:21:07.641,Two tickets to see the great Michael Bublé.
00:21:07.725,00:21:09.976,The guy sings like an angel.
00:21:10.060,00:21:11.978,He’s gonna be outside at one of the amphitheaters.
00:21:12.062,00:21:13.772,Gloria’s gonna love it.
00:21:13.856,00:21:15.899,No. I’m talkin’ about you and me.
00:21:20.362,00:21:23.365,"You know? I’ll get some nice bottle of wine, a little cheese."
00:21:23.449,00:21:26.118,Lay on a nice blanket. All right?
00:21:26.202,00:21:29.746,"Yo, hey. I like your hair. Who does your hair? Huh?"
00:21:29.830,00:21:32.208,"Yo, handsome. Who does your hair?"
00:00:03.587,00:00:05.088,What are you doing with those?
00:00:06.757,00:00:08.842,"If we collect enough bottles, they build a school in Africa."
00:00:08.926,00:00:12.512,Wouldn’t that be so cool to go to a school made out of bottles?
00:00:12.596,00:00:15.640,That would certainly be a special school.
00:00:15.724,00:00:18.726,"Did you hear what I said, parents? Special school?"
00:00:18.810,00:00:22.021,"Okay, nobody make a big deal about it, but I just broke up with Dylan."
00:00:22.105,00:00:24.691,No!
00:00:24.775,00:00:30.697,"Yeah, I’m fine. I just– I need to date someone who has a clue, instead of an idiot who bangs his head..."
00:00:33.951,00:00:36.578,"I’m sorry, honey."
00:00:36.662,00:00:40.373,I’m sorry for both of you. I’ll have to text him later.
00:00:40.457,00:00:42.458,Mmm. I gotta jump in the shower. I’m gonna be late.
00:00:42.542,00:00:44.669,- Where are you going? - I’m going to meet my friend Valerie.
00:00:47.130,00:00:49.132,- You worked? - Mm-hmm.
00:00:49.216,00:00:51.176,Can’t imagine you working.
00:00:51.260,00:00:53.219,That is very offensive to women.
00:00:53.303,00:00:56.974,Your mom works very hard. It’s just now she works for us.
00:01:01.019,00:01:03.479,I was an account manager at Starcrest Hotels.
00:01:03.563,00:01:06.733,"I had a little cubicle, and-and I wore my tennis shoes to work..."
00:01:06.817,00:01:08.234,and changed into my work pumps.
00:01:11.905,00:01:14.324,I don’t mind saying I was making quite a splash.
00:01:14.408,00:01:19.412,"- Well, then, why’d you quit? - Well, Haley, call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to focus on raising a family."
00:01:19.496,00:01:21.581,So I married your dad.
00:01:21.665,00:01:24.125,"Five months later, we... were..."
00:01:24.209,00:01:27.503,four months away from having this little bundle of joy.
00:01:27.587,00:01:29.881,Mm-hmm.
00:01:31.508,00:01:33.635,There’s my lawyer.
00:01:33.719,00:01:37.639,"Gloria got into a little car accident, so my dad asked me to help her out."
00:01:37.723,00:01:43.436,"And, uh, this is the first time that my dad’s asked me for legal advice, and it’s– it’s nice."
00:01:43.520,00:01:45.730,It’s nice to know that he respects me in that way.
00:01:45.814,00:01:48.024,"Well, Mitchell is an amazing lawyer. Oh."
00:01:53.363,00:01:57.034,So at parties I can tell everyone my partner is one of the Supremes.
00:01:58.702,00:02:01.829,"There he is– the steely, grizzled veteran..."
00:02:01.913,00:02:03.998,ready to do battle with the plucky upstart.
00:02:04.082,00:02:11.339,Speed versus grace. Brute force versus– I love the sauna. That’s the dry heat.
00:02:11.423,00:02:12.966,"And the steam, wet."
00:02:13.050,00:02:15.885,"And, of course, I am just a kook for racquetball."
00:02:15.969,00:02:20.139,"Club champ two years in a row, Tonganoxie, Missouri Rec Center."
00:02:20.223,00:02:23.977,"So, naturally, Jay and I have been trying for months..."
00:02:24.061,00:02:27.314,to get together to bang the old hollow rubber ball around.
00:02:29.066,00:02:31.359,I have been avoiding this day like the plague.
00:02:31.443,00:02:34.821,"I mean, part of going to the gym is the locker-room atmosphere."
00:02:34.905,00:02:37.907,"And if I’m there with a gay guy, it’s-it’s just not gonna be the same."
00:02:37.991,00:02:40.034,"I mean, for me, it’s a locker room."
00:02:40.118,00:02:42.162,"For him, it’s a showroom."
00:03:10.774,00:03:14.193,Some people call me a salesman. I call myself a sales friend.
00:03:14.277,00:03:16.237,"So obviously, I need strangers to trust me."
00:03:16.321,00:03:19.073,I don’t take kindly to it when someone Tom Sellecks my bus bench.
00:03:19.157,00:03:21.075,Phil Dunphy.
00:03:23.328,00:03:26.080,Why? What happened?
00:03:26.164,00:03:28.833,I told her to call you.
00:03:28.917,00:03:31.878,I’ll handle it. I’m not losing this sale.
00:03:31.962,00:03:33.921,By the way– I’ve spent way too much time on it.
00:03:34.005,00:03:36.883,"Phil, do you take Elm when you come to work?"
00:03:46.768,00:03:48.686,Very liberal with the towels. I love that.
00:03:48.770,00:03:50.855,"Showers are private, in case you wondered."
00:03:50.939,00:03:53.691,"I wasn’t, but thanks for the heads-up."
00:03:57.195,00:03:59.906,"Well, I just always pictured you as a tighty-whitey guy."
00:03:59.990,00:04:03.326,"Well, do me a favor. The next time you picture me, leave the underwear out of it."
00:04:03.410,00:04:05.286,"Well, don’t you worry. The only thing I’m picturing..."
00:04:10.500,00:04:15.713,’Cause it’s gonna take a little more than some lame trash talk to get me out of my–- Gaah! What the hell was that?
00:04:15.797,00:04:17.256,Our butts pressed against each other.
00:04:17.340,00:04:19.759,They didn’t press. It was glancing. Stop talking about it!
00:04:23.180,00:04:25.014,- You got a name for it? - It’s very common.
00:04:25.098,00:04:27.141,You got off easy. At least it didn’t happen after a shower.
00:04:27.225,00:04:29.227,Enough.
00:04:29.311,00:04:32.189,That’s it. I’m changing in the stall. Excuse me!
00:04:35.275,00:04:37.193,"I saw the picture, Dylan."
00:04:37.277,00:04:40.488,You had your arm around her with that humpy look you get.
00:04:40.572,00:04:43.324,"No, that’s not always how you look. We’re over!"
00:04:43.408,00:04:47.620,"So, I’d really like to talk to you, Mrs. Patterson, see if we can’t turn this thing around."
00:04:47.704,00:04:49.163,"Uh, you’ve got my number."
00:04:49.247,00:04:52.083,Thank you.
00:04:52.167,00:04:54.001,Why don’t you go out for a nice bike ride?
00:04:54.085,00:04:56.003,"Dylan again, huh?"
00:04:56.087,00:04:59.507,Some guys just do not know how to play it.
00:04:59.591,00:05:01.634,"- Dad, what are you doing? - Oh, right."
00:05:01.718,00:05:03.845,"Just, uh, test-driving my new soup strainer."
00:05:03.929,00:05:06.515,I dug it out of the Halloween stuff to see what people think.
00:05:11.394,00:05:13.938,Do people want their real estate advice...
00:05:14.022,00:05:16.941,from someone who leads or from someone who follows?
00:05:17.025,00:05:19.235,I’m betting these babies are coming back in a big way.
00:05:19.319,00:05:20.987,"Buy low, sell high."
00:05:21.071,00:05:23.949,"People are gonna see this and say, That guy’s high."
00:05:26.576,00:05:30.746,"Sorry to bother you, sir. We’re doing work next door and nicked a main, so we’re gonna have to shut down your water."
00:05:30.830,00:05:32.498,Oh. Okay. No problem.
00:05:32.582,00:05:35.418,"It shouldn’t be too long. If you need it, there’s a porta-potty out front."
00:05:35.502,00:05:37.170,Thanks. Hey.
00:05:37.254,00:05:39.130,Nice mustache.
00:05:39.214,00:05:42.217,"Yeah, man. You too, brother."
00:05:43.760,00:05:45.720,"You too, brother."
00:05:49.099,00:05:52.143,Haley– She’s the oldest. Fifteen.
00:05:52.227,00:05:54.145,And then Alex is 13.
00:05:54.229,00:05:58.191,"And that’s my baby, Luke. He’s 11. Can you believe it?"
00:05:58.275,00:06:01.027,Yeah.
00:06:01.111,00:06:03.237,Yes. Things are great. Great with him.
00:06:03.321,00:06:07.200,I’m so happy for you. Really. I’m so– I’m so happy that you’re happy.
00:06:09.786,00:06:12.705,"I mean, your life is– No, no, no– Let’s talk about you."
00:06:12.789,00:06:15.583,Okay.
00:06:12.789,00:06:18.377,"Because, you know, you’re– You chose the mother. You’re the mommy."
00:06:18.461,00:06:21.047,"The yummy mommy, mama– Uh-huh?"
00:06:22.674,00:06:26.010,You’re kinda squeezing the ring right into my finger. Was I?
00:06:26.094,00:06:28.054,A little.
00:06:28.138,00:06:31.557,"And just then, it hit me. She was jealous of me."
00:06:31.641,00:06:34.227,"Yes, there’d always been a little bit of a competition between us."
00:06:34.311,00:06:36.687,This was more serious.
00:06:39.482,00:06:42.568,"that she’d always wanted, but never had."
00:06:44.154,00:06:46.072,You still got the bastards on the 23rd floor...
00:06:48.825,00:06:52.245,"Same as ever, right?"
00:06:52.329,00:06:54.247,Mm-hmm?
00:06:54.331,00:06:56.999,Wait. You’re on the 23rd floor?
00:06:57.083,00:06:59.961,Wow. That’s insane.
00:07:00.045,00:07:03.632,"I mean, if you hadn’t left, it probably would have been you."
00:07:12.057,00:07:14.892,"And boom– Out of nowhere, he hits me."
00:07:14.976,00:07:17.019,"Okay, so, he-he cut you off?"
00:07:19.105,00:07:21.107,"You know, I used to be a little bit like that."
00:07:21.191,00:07:24.360,"I don’t know, maybe it’s because of Lily, but I’ve definitely become more considerate."
00:07:24.444,00:07:28.030,"Like, I used to never let people in, and now I do."
00:07:28.114,00:07:31.576,Just now getting that metaphor. Okay.
00:07:31.660,00:07:33.703,"So, what do you think?"
00:07:33.787,00:07:35.955,"No, just Manny. He was in the back seat."
00:07:36.039,00:07:38.791,Okay.
00:07:38.875,00:07:40.793,"Yeah. All right. Well, this is what we’re gonna do."
00:07:40.877,00:07:43.504,"I’ll take a few pictures, and then we’ll sit down and write a statement."
00:07:43.588,00:07:45.423,Perfect. I’ll go and get us a table.
00:07:45.507,00:07:47.425,All right.
00:07:47.509,00:07:50.177,"Uh, just a minute, Mom. I need to tie my shoe."
00:07:50.261,00:07:52.013,- Mitchell. - Yeah?
00:07:52.097,00:07:54.390,Don’t talk. Listen. It was her fault.
00:07:54.474,00:07:57.894,- I’m sorry. What? - Don’t look at me. Do something. Take pictures.
00:07:58.978,00:08:01.647,Manny! What kind of cupcake do you want?
00:08:01.731,00:08:04.525,"Um, that’s okay. I’m not hungry."
00:08:04.609,00:08:07.403,That was a mistake. Now she’ll know something’s up.
00:08:07.487,00:08:10.531,- Are you okay? - I’m fine.
00:08:10.615,00:08:12.825,She cut that guy off. She’s a terrible driver.
00:08:12.909,00:08:15.703,She’s a danger to us all.
00:08:15.787,00:08:18.539,I thought she said he was parked and then he cut her off.
00:08:18.623,00:08:21.000,Everybody looks parked when you’re going a hundred miles an hour.
00:08:21.084,00:08:23.377,"Manny, why didn’t you speak up?"
00:08:23.461,00:08:25.838,She can’t take criticism about her driving.
00:08:25.922,00:08:27.923,Once an old lady yelled at her at a crosswalk.
00:08:32.929,00:08:34.681,I’ve said too much already.
00:08:43.189,00:08:45.233,"Aw, that’s– Point."
00:08:46.776,00:08:47.777,Hinder!
00:08:49.446,00:08:51.405,Boom.
00:08:51.489,00:08:54.158,"That is game and, I believe, match."
00:08:54.242,00:08:57.411,"Yeah, fine, you won. But, you know, what do you expect?"
00:08:57.495,00:09:00.748,"For the first half of the game, I was distracted by what happened in the locker room."
00:09:00.832,00:09:03.751,And you’re sure it’s not because I’m a fabulous racquetball player?
00:09:03.835,00:09:06.420,You’re average. But I was a little thrown by you touching me.
00:09:10.967,00:09:13.844,When you’re gay you just walk around giving butt bumps to everybody.
00:09:13.928,00:09:15.846,It’s like a high five. It’s a low two.
00:09:19.309,00:09:21.644,"We’re gonna have a rematch right here, right now."
00:09:21.728,00:09:23.646,So you want to go up against me again?
00:09:23.730,00:09:25.481,No! Damn it.
00:09:27.567,00:09:30.403,"Hey, Dad. Uh, did you know that the accident was Gloria’s fault?"
00:09:30.487,00:09:33.072,"Yes. I mean, I wasn’t there, but she’s a horrible driver."
00:09:33.156,00:09:34.782,"If she hit 10 cars, I wouldn’t be surprised."
00:09:37.035,00:09:39.995,"Because someone has to tell her she’s in the wrong, and better you than me."
00:09:40.079,00:09:45.251,"That’s great. Here I am thinking that my dad actually respects me as a lawyer, and really you’re just throwing me to the wolves."
00:09:45.335,00:09:48.421,"- Can’t it be both? - Okay. Dad, it doesn’t bother you in the least..."
00:09:48.505,00:09:51.340,that your gay son is the only one tough enough to stand up to your wife?
00:09:51.424,00:09:53.342,"Go get ’em, Rocky. See you later."
00:09:53.426,00:09:56.679,Your father and I had a moon landing in the locker room.
00:09:56.763,00:10:00.516,What about you? Do you ever get serious with anyone? Thank you.
00:10:00.600,00:10:02.435,"Sure. Oh, no. Not yet."
00:10:02.519,00:10:04.645,"Oh, honey, you will."
00:10:04.729,00:10:07.398,"Oh, no, I hope not. It’s– It’s fun."
00:10:17.534,00:10:19.660,"Yeah, no. I mean, I’ll never get it, but it’d be great..."
00:10:19.744,00:10:21.662,’cause one of my lovers lives in Paris.
00:10:21.746,00:10:27.460,"Wow. I-I don’t know what jumps out of that sentence more– you know, lovers or one of."
00:10:27.544,00:10:30.337,"Well, I’m single. I mean, it’s kinda what you do."
00:10:30.421,00:10:32.715,Uh-huh.
00:10:32.799,00:10:36.802,Oh.
00:10:36.886,00:10:38.637,I have a fourth one.
00:10:38.721,00:10:41.474,I’m forgetting one lover. I’m forgetting one lover.
00:10:41.558,00:10:44.393,Last night I vacuumed the radiator thingy under the fridge.
00:10:51.317,00:10:53.360,I’m not gonna lie.
00:10:53.444,00:10:58.824,"The thought of Valerie getting the one job in the whole company that everyone coveted– Well, I wasn’t a lover of that."
00:10:58.908,00:11:00.994,"Okay. Okay, thank you."
00:11:02.036,00:11:04.079,Well?
00:11:04.163,00:11:06.081,"Oh, they haven’t made a decision."
00:11:06.165,00:11:08.584,They’re– They’re gonna tell me later on.
00:11:08.668,00:11:11.253,"That’s not what they said, is it?"
00:11:11.337,00:11:13.339,"Oh, Valerie, come on. It’s me."
00:11:13.423,00:11:16.550,"What are friends for, if not to be there for you when you get bad news?"
00:11:16.634,00:11:19.220,I got it.
00:11:19.304,00:11:22.473,I’m the head of Europe.
00:11:19.304,00:11:26.018,"Well, you know, for the hotel– Not the continent."
00:11:26.102,00:11:28.605,Why didn’t you tell me when you first heard?
00:11:29.939,00:11:34.777,"Oh, ’cause, you know– And that’s when it really hit me."
00:11:34.861,00:11:37.530,Valerie wasn’t jealous of me. She pitied me.
00:11:37.614,00:11:40.616,And part of me wanted to take her back to the house...
00:11:42.952,00:11:46.288,"in her sad, childless, husbandless life."
00:11:46.372,00:11:51.210,But there’s a little thing called taking the high road.
00:11:51.294,00:11:54.547,Why don’t you come by and meet everybody?
00:11:54.631,00:12:02.763,"Yeah, I mean, Alex is just a genius, and Haley is turning into this beautiful young woman, and it makes me realize that motherhood is– San Francisco."
00:12:02.847,00:12:05.266,the most important– That was my fourth lover. San Francisco.
00:12:05.350,00:12:07.477,It would have kept me up all night.
00:12:09.145,00:12:11.230,"Dad, look."
00:12:11.314,00:12:13.399,"Just a sec, buddy. I’m on my way out to the bathroom."
00:12:13.483,00:12:17.319,"Check it out. The Aubreys had this huge party last night, and we got all these bottles to recycle."
00:12:17.403,00:12:19.905,Great.
00:12:19.989,00:12:24.827,"Um– Well, you know how in a fairy tale..."
00:12:24.911,00:12:29.081,"there’s always a potion that makes the princess fall asleep, and then the guys start kissing her?"
00:12:29.165,00:12:35.171,"Well, this is like that, except you don’t wake up in a castle, you wake up in a frat house with a bad reputation."
00:12:52.146,00:12:54.065,Haley!
00:12:59.529,00:13:01.989,"- Luke, you’re spilling it! - Aw, crud."
00:13:02.073,00:13:07.453,God– Cool.
00:13:12.792,00:13:15.794,I believe you have something that belongs to me.
00:13:15.878,00:13:18.715,My heart.
00:13:20.008,00:13:22.135,Ow! Haley.
00:13:26.639,00:13:30.225,Hello? Dylan? D-Money?
00:13:30.309,00:13:32.562,"Hey, buddy! Hey, buddy!"
00:13:33.646,00:13:35.397,"Hello, friendly neighbors!"
00:13:35.481,00:13:37.650,Little help?
00:13:37.734,00:13:40.110,"- But I love you. - Well, you should have thought about that..."
00:13:43.906,00:13:45.491,I didn’t take her. She was just there.
00:13:45.575,00:13:49.286,So you were just there by yourself at an Anne Hathaway movie?
00:13:49.370,00:13:53.165,I don’t think so!
00:13:53.249,00:13:56.168,She’s every woman. Come on. Let’s not fight.
00:13:56.252,00:14:00.881,- Let’s just discuss this like two un-immature adults. - Oh!
00:14:05.636,00:14:07.137,Hello? Mrs. Patterson.
00:14:07.221,00:14:09.223,Hi. I’ve been waiting for your call.
00:14:09.307,00:14:15.020,"Yeah. Uh, is there any chance that maybe we could talk a little bit– No, no, no, no. Now’s perfect. That’s fine."
00:14:18.649,00:14:21.069,"There we go. Much, much better."
00:14:24.113,00:14:27.199,"Okay. Maybe, uh, we should go over the accident one more time."
00:14:27.283,00:14:30.786,Put the dogs on a row. You’re such a good lawyer.
00:14:30.870,00:14:34.373,"Uh, I just wanna make sure we’re 100% clear on exactly what happened."
00:14:34.457,00:14:36.625,"Oh, we’re clear. I told you."
00:14:36.709,00:14:40.170,What? You don’t believe me?
00:14:40.254,00:14:44.383,"No, no. I just– You know, sometimes you can forget tiny details."
00:14:44.467,00:14:48.554,"Like, is it possible, maybe, uh, you were driving too fast?"
00:14:48.638,00:14:51.057,Who said I was driving fast?
00:14:52.100,00:15:00.441,"I just– I’m looking at the street, and I’m thinking if you were driving a little fast, -it’s possible that maybe you didn’t see the car– -You’re like everyone else, huh?"
00:15:00.525,00:15:04.570,"You blame the Latino driver. Where I come from, they always blame the Latino driver."
00:15:07.031,00:15:10.409,"Manny, tell him."
00:15:10.493,00:15:12.578,"Oh, come on. Don’t blame your cupcake."
00:15:12.662,00:15:14.621,What? You think I’m guilty too?
00:15:14.705,00:15:16.623,No.
00:15:16.707,00:15:19.168,I don’t need you as a lawyer anymore.
00:15:19.252,00:15:23.922,"And if you two think I’m such a bad driver, you’re safer walking home."
00:15:30.513,00:15:32.514,Yeah. We’re pretty proud of it.
00:15:32.598,00:15:34.767,Here’s your stupid CDs...
00:15:34.851,00:15:37.102,and your clothes and your poems!
00:15:37.186,00:15:39.646,Don’t you do it!
00:15:43.276,00:15:46.361,"Oh, why don’t you go get a hickey from Sharon Nicolini?"
00:15:46.445,00:15:48.989,"It’s from my guitar strap, Haley."
00:15:49.073,00:15:51.784,"Oh, thanks for reminding me."
00:15:49.073,00:15:58.332,"That’s my daughter Haley– and her boyfriend, Dylan, um– This is a nice color."
00:15:58.416,00:16:03.295,"Um, listen. This is not normal, with all that, nor– nor is that liquor smell."
00:16:03.379,00:16:06.799,"Phil, honey? Oh, my God. Luke, what is that?"
00:16:06.883,00:16:10.010,Jägermeister. Dad says it makes girls easier to kiss.
00:16:10.094,00:16:12.513,- What happened to the rug? - I had an accident.
00:16:12.597,00:16:15.808,"- Okay. Alex, what are you doing? - I’m trying to kill a rat."
00:16:15.892,00:16:22.064,Okay– Don’t you get it? I love your ass.
00:16:22.148,00:16:25.609,"I– You know, I– I-I’m late and I should go."
00:16:27.403,00:16:29.988,And it seems like things have gotten a little wonky around here.
00:16:30.072,00:16:39.790,"I don’t know where Phil is. He’s definitely– Oh, my God. Alex– Where’s your father?"
00:16:39.874,00:16:41.834,Uh-huh.
00:16:41.918,00:16:45.087,"It’s... not usually like this. Oh, gross."
00:16:46.881,00:16:49.341,Let’s just get married. Okay.
00:16:55.598,00:17:00.435,"You should come back again– sometime, when you get a break– Claire! Claire!"
00:17:02.980,00:17:06.608,"Just concluding a little business. Very successfully, I might add."
00:17:06.692,00:17:08.277,Honey– Hey!
00:17:08.361,00:17:09.570,- Hi. - Is that Valerie?
00:17:11.614,00:17:13.157,You look fantastic.
00:17:13.241,00:17:15.367,Come here. Get over here.
00:17:15.451,00:17:17.452,Okay.
00:17:17.536,00:17:19.454,How long has it been?
00:17:19.538,00:17:21.456,"- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, I can’t touch you. Okay."
00:17:21.540,00:17:24.126,"A little bit difficult. Gulf divides us, eh?"
00:17:24.210,00:17:26.086,So nice to see you.
00:17:24.210,00:17:27.337,It’s great to see you though– Okay.
00:17:29.298,00:17:30.632,It’s such a pleasure.
00:17:30.716,00:17:32.467,Thanks for stopping by.
00:17:41.185,00:17:43.187,One time! Once!
00:17:43.271,00:17:45.230,One time I bring somebody home...
00:17:47.692,00:17:50.569,A bunch of booze-drenched hill people...
00:17:50.653,00:17:53.280,just sitting around in their underwear and-and chasing rats...
00:17:53.364,00:17:55.449,and fornicating in the stairwell.
00:17:55.533,00:17:58.577,Can I say something?
00:17:58.661,00:18:01.121,There is nothing left to say but thank you.
00:18:01.205,00:18:03.165,Thank you all.
00:18:12.425,00:18:14.343,Ow!
00:18:14.427,00:18:16.094,I told you I’d win.
00:18:16.178,00:18:18.305,"Not talking so much now, are you, hotshot?"
00:18:18.389,00:18:25.812,"Hope you enjoy that nice, hot shower, but it’s not gonna wash away the shame of that 15-7 beatdown."
00:18:25.896,00:18:28.857,You should have seen the look on your face...
00:18:28.941,00:18:30.859,when that drop shot just kissed the wall.
00:18:33.279,00:18:35.739,Got me again. Yep.
00:18:35.823,00:18:37.824,Make the uptight straight guy all embarrassed.
00:18:37.908,00:18:40.118,Except for one thing– Doesn’t even bother me anymore.
00:18:40.202,00:18:43.288,"I could do this all day. Here, another one for you."
00:18:45.583,00:18:47.167,"Jay, I just noticed a sauna back here."
00:18:47.251,00:18:49.962,How big of a hurry are we in?
00:18:51.422,00:18:53.632,’Scuse me. ’Scuse me.
00:18:53.716,00:18:57.636,"Well, if you’re going to be stranded, might as well be in a place full of cupcakes."
00:18:57.720,00:18:59.555,I don’t think you need any more.
00:19:00.598,00:19:03.433,"Ay. I’m sorry, guys."
00:19:10.232,00:19:12.150,Let’s go.
00:19:12.234,00:19:17.322,It’s just that I don’t like when people just assume that I’m a bad driver.
00:19:17.406,00:19:19.908,"Maybe it was just, like, a little bit my fault."
00:19:19.992,00:19:21.952,"Well, I’m glad you can admit that, Gloria."
00:19:22.036,00:19:25.330,"But I’m still gonna need you as my lawyer, Mitch."
00:19:25.414,00:19:26.748,Why?
00:19:25.414,00:19:30.586,"Because this one– It was not my fault, I promise you."
00:19:32.546,00:19:35.591,That’s what that sound was.
00:19:36.634,00:19:38.635,That was unreal. Mom was crazy.
00:19:38.719,00:19:40.679,I’m scared.
00:19:44.642,00:19:49.605,"I’d be willing to bet she’s just composing herself, taking a nice, long, peaceful walk in the park."
00:20:06.205,00:20:08.707,"But of course, that meant finding a way to apologize..."
00:20:08.791,00:20:11.793,to the people that I had belittled and rejected.
00:20:15.005,00:20:17.382,Crazy right.
00:20:17.466,00:20:18.717,"Hey, honey."
00:20:20.386,00:20:23.555,"No, seriously, Dad. It’s lame."
00:20:25.683,00:20:28.393,I think I know a little bit about music. I was a deejay in college.
00:20:28.477,00:20:31.021,I had my own show– in the coveted time slot.
00:20:31.105,00:20:33.523,Daybreak with Dunphy.
00:20:33.607,00:20:36.234,"No, I’m not kidding you. And I played Rick Astley."
00:20:36.318,00:20:38.945,"Dad, that’s embarrassing."
00:20:41.031,00:20:43.992,"They really could have made me pay, but they didn’t."
00:20:44.076,00:20:45.994,Never loved ’em more.
00:20:46.078,00:20:49.331,Why the hell couldn’t Valerie have seen them like that?
00:20:58.466,00:21:01.802,"Hey, Dylan."
00:21:01.886,00:21:04.930,"- Hey, Mr. Dunphy. - What’s happening?"
00:21:05.014,00:21:07.015,"Well, Haley and I got into another fight."
00:21:07.099,00:21:11.186,Oh– Say Anything.
00:21:11.270,00:21:13.605,"Um, good morning?"
00:21:13.689,00:21:17.192,No. Say Anything.
00:21:17.276,00:21:19.736,"No, Dylan. Say Anything. Clutch movie."
00:21:19.820,00:21:22.030,Clutch movie.
00:21:22.114,00:21:25.367,She probably won’t be up for a couple hours still.
00:21:25.451,00:21:28.204,It’s okay. It’s not that heavy.
00:00:03.003,00:00:05.213,Happy Valentine’s Day.
00:00:05.297,00:00:07.633,"Oh, happy Valentine’s Day."
00:00:11.178,00:00:14.097,Oh!
00:00:14.181,00:00:17.559,"So, Fratelli’s tonight?"
00:00:20.938,00:00:22.897,Swanky material.
00:00:22.981,00:00:25.692,"Jay, you look so strong and sexy."
00:00:29.279,00:00:31.948,Your turn.
00:00:32.032,00:00:35.702,This is my favorite day in America.
00:00:38.538,00:00:41.291,"Oh, my God."
00:00:41.375,00:00:43.877,Beautiful.
00:00:43.961,00:00:46.546,I have a surprise.
00:00:52.302,00:00:56.097,And who’s David Brenner?
00:00:58.892,00:01:03.062,He’s a comedian.
00:01:03.146,00:01:05.815,"I thought we were going salsa dancing, not to watch a comedian."
00:01:05.899,00:01:07.775,You’re gonna love him. Trust me.
00:01:07.859,00:01:11.279,The guy’s hilarious.
00:01:11.363,00:01:12.947,He doesn’t do jokes.
00:01:13.031,00:01:15.491,Does he have a mallet?
00:01:15.575,00:01:17.410,So then how does he get hit in the head?
00:01:17.494,00:01:19.078,He doesn’t get hit in the head.
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.997,He– He makes observations.
00:01:23.500,00:01:26.586,Come on. He’s been on Johnny Carson a hundred times.
00:01:26.670,00:01:28.922,Who the hell is Johnny Carson?
00:01:29.006,00:01:31.090,Gloria and I are from different generations.
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.384,And I won’t lie– It isn’t always easy.
00:01:33.468,00:01:37.263,"I mean, last week she thought Simon and Garfunkel were my lawyers."
00:01:37.347,00:01:39.766,No I didn’t.
00:01:39.850,00:01:42.685,I don’t get it.
00:01:42.769,00:01:45.939,"Yeah, I wish I had a mallet right now."
00:01:48.025,00:01:51.527,Did you indicate to her how long that you were gonna take?
00:01:51.611,00:01:53.947,Happy Valentine’s Day.
00:01:55.324,00:01:58.201,"Happy Valentine’s Day, Daddy."
00:02:01.538,00:02:03.289,"Oh, that is cute."
00:02:03.373,00:02:05.375,We spent a lot of time on this.
00:02:08.045,00:02:10.421,"Uh– Actually, no. We repurposed it."
00:02:10.505,00:02:13.132,It was sort of a Bob Mackie meets Martha Stewart project.
00:02:13.216,00:02:15.385,"Okay. Well, we just thought it would be a nice surprise."
00:02:15.469,00:02:18.680,"It’s hardly a surprise. I mean, you dress her up for every holiday."
00:02:22.559,00:02:25.228,"- All right. Not in the spirit. We get it. - No, I’m-I’m sorry."
00:02:25.312,00:02:29.232,No. It’s adorable. I just– I’m really nervous about my closing argument.
00:02:29.316,00:02:31.484,"Oh, you’ve been rehearsing for weeks. You’re gonna be great."
00:02:31.568,00:02:33.736,Let’s hope so.
00:02:31.568,00:02:36.656,"Hey, and I was wondering– Since you’re gonna be in court all day– You can open the chocolates."
00:02:37.866,00:02:39.868,Score.
00:02:42.120,00:02:46.165,"Hi, Dylan."
00:02:46.249,00:02:49.460,"Oh. Dylan, thank you. That is so sweet."
00:02:49.544,00:02:53.006,"You know, all women should look as tasty as you when they’re old."
00:02:53.090,00:02:54.757,Huh. Conflicted.
00:02:54.841,00:02:56.342,"Hey, baby."
00:02:56.426,00:03:03.475,"Hey. Take this sweet gift as a token of my affection, my unending love and admiration– Oh, my God. Yay, it’s big!"
00:03:06.937,00:03:10.064,I love it. It’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.
00:03:14.528,00:03:17.280,"Wow! Dylan, I didn’t know you could paint. Oh, I didn’t."
00:03:17.364,00:03:21.034,I just took a photo and I put it through this program that turns it into a painting.
00:03:21.118,00:03:22.076,Oh.
00:03:22.160,00:03:24.537,So you two actually did...
00:03:24.621,00:03:26.664,that.
00:03:26.748,00:03:29.042,Yeah. Okay.
00:03:29.126,00:03:30.793,"Not– No, no. Mm-mmm."
00:03:30.877,00:03:32.879,You don’t need to be in the bedroom at all.
00:03:32.963,00:03:34.923,I’ll take it.
00:03:35.966,00:03:38.134,D-Money.
00:03:38.218,00:03:41.387,You tell me. He made a painting out of a photograph one time.
00:03:41.471,00:03:52.732,"I have hand-picked a card, drawn a heart in the steam on the medicine cabinet, and taken Claire to Fratelli’s, a family-style Italian restaurant, for 17 years in a row."
00:03:52.816,00:03:55.360,"Yeah, he got me. He got me."
00:04:08.665,00:04:11.334,See you later.
00:04:12.669,00:04:16.089,"You know, we don’t have to go to Fratelli’s tonight."
00:04:16.173,00:04:19.467,"Okay, what do you have in mind?"
00:04:19.551,00:04:24.806,"Well, I thought you might enjoy a night at a hotel."
00:04:24.890,00:04:27.433,"I would, but would you and the kids be okay?"
00:04:27.517,00:04:29.811,I meant together.
00:04:29.895,00:04:32.021,Oh.
00:04:36.526,00:04:41.990,"I think you’re not getting any sleep tonight, so you might want to take a nap at work today."
00:04:43.033,00:04:45.368,I always do.
00:04:47.871,00:04:50.289,Phil? Sweetie.
00:04:59.591,00:05:01.801,Role-play?
00:05:02.969,00:05:06.389,I’m in.
00:05:06.473,00:05:10.309,And I’ll swing by after work to pick you up.
00:05:10.393,00:05:15.481,Why don’t you meet me in the hotel bar and see if you can pick me up there.
00:05:15.565,00:05:19.569,"Careful, lady. You’re gonna wake up a sexy sleeping giant."
00:05:27.452,00:05:29.162,Phil– Or...
00:05:32.916,00:05:34.793,Kinda wrecking it.
00:05:39.464,00:05:41.382,I just train tigers for a living.
00:05:54.020,00:05:57.023,Are these rose petals?
00:05:57.107,00:06:01.861,"Well, your mom might think so, but a lot of people think I’m a catch."
00:06:01.945,00:06:09.243,"I– I was this close to nailing it, and then my client gets scared and settles."
00:06:09.327,00:06:13.248,Maybe you’d like a chocolate. Notice that I have not eaten any of the chocolates.
00:06:14.457,00:06:17.627,There were two levels. You know it and I know it.
00:06:17.711,00:06:19.879,This is so frustrating.
00:06:19.963,00:06:27.470,"I had one of the greatest closing arguments of all time– all about the big government rolling over the little guy, and I even had this great moment at the end..."
00:06:30.640,00:06:32.642,"Oh, that’s what you were doing in the shower."
00:06:32.726,00:06:34.644,I was a little worried.
00:06:34.728,00:06:37.980,"Um, that’s Manny. I said we would watch him tonight. I hope you don’t mind."
00:06:38.064,00:06:40.066,I didn’t know you were gonna be going through all this.
00:06:42.235,00:06:45.154,"Hi, Manny."
00:06:45.238,00:06:46.948,The universe is cold and loveless.
00:06:47.032,00:06:50.159,- Uh-oh. - Uh-oh. Bad Valentine’s Day?
00:06:53.580,00:06:57.583,"I poured my heart and soul into a poem, left it on her desk."
00:06:57.667,00:07:00.253,I even burned the edges to make it look fancy.
00:07:00.337,00:07:02.588,"- And she didn’t like it? - Oh, she loved it."
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.799,But this kid Durkas told her he wrote it.
00:07:04.883,00:07:07.426,"Well, Manny, why-why didn’t you just tell her the truth?"
00:07:07.510,00:07:09.095,She was already gone.
00:07:09.179,00:07:12.265,"And she’s on a date with him at my favorite restaurant, Great Shakes."
00:07:15.018,00:07:18.896,"Right after the line of, My love is deeper than the Great Lakes."
00:07:18.980,00:07:22.066,"- Okay, well, this is unacceptable. - Oh, boy. Here we go."
00:07:22.150,00:07:24.569,"No, it’s not that big of a deal. This is what we’re gonna do."
00:07:24.653,00:07:26.362,"We’re gonna shoot over to Great Shakes, get a table."
00:07:26.446,00:07:28.281,Manny can reclaim the love of his life.
00:07:28.365,00:07:29.991,You and I can get a couple Mudslides.
00:07:30.075,00:07:31.742,I don’t know.
00:07:31.826,00:07:35.621,Durkas is gonna be there. I’ve seen the kid do a pull-up.
00:07:35.705,00:07:37.623,"Hey, Manny, it’s Valentine’s Day."
00:07:39.709,00:07:42.253,"It’s the day you track it down, tie it up and take it home."
00:07:42.337,00:07:44.714,"Now, if we can pull this off, you and your little lady friend..."
00:07:44.798,00:07:47.675,will be belly up to a ice cream counter having a milk shake with two straws.
00:07:47.759,00:07:50.011,What do you say?
00:07:50.095,00:07:51.804,I like it.
00:07:58.561,00:08:03.524,Women with big rear ends live longer.
00:08:03.608,00:08:05.568,Man who tell ’em that don’t.
00:08:07.404,00:08:12.533,"Did you read about this man, a 91-year old bank robber in Texas?"
00:08:12.617,00:08:18.497,He goes into a bank– The hell did I want?
00:08:18.581,00:08:22.126,"They had over 4,000 photos of him escaping from the bank."
00:08:25.755,00:08:27.632,See?
00:08:27.716,00:08:29.675,"He’s funny, huh?"
00:08:39.769,00:08:42.063,Mind if I join you?
00:08:42.147,00:08:45.066,I’m Clive. Clive Bixby.
00:08:49.446,00:08:54.742,"So, Clive, you in town for a convention, or do you just forget your name a lot?"
00:08:54.826,00:08:57.453,Pretty kitty has nails.
00:08:57.537,00:08:59.456,I like that.
00:09:01.040,00:09:02.958,I’m in town for a trade show.
00:09:03.042,00:09:07.254,I design high-end electroacoustic transducers.
00:09:07.338,00:09:09.382,"Wow, that is very..."
00:09:09.466,00:09:11.884,specific.
00:09:11.968,00:09:15.388,It’s a fancy way of saying I get things to make noise.
00:09:15.472,00:09:17.390,Hmm.
00:09:17.474,00:09:19.476,"So, what’s your story?"
00:09:20.852,00:09:23.896,Miss America Pageant in town?
00:09:23.980,00:09:26.774,"You’re a pretty smooth talker, Clive."
00:09:26.858,00:09:29.360,I’m pretty smooth all over.
00:09:30.904,00:09:32.822,"Sir, there’s no smoking in here."
00:09:32.906,00:09:35.700,"Oh, that’s fine. I’m not actually a smoker."
00:09:39.370,00:09:42.039,"You’re quite the Boy Scout, Clive."
00:09:42.123,00:09:46.252,"Tell me, would you be interested in earning a merit badge tonight?"
00:09:46.336,00:09:49.589,Do you know anything about tying knots?
00:09:50.632,00:09:54.593,I probably shouldn’t be talking to you.
00:09:54.677,00:09:56.637,I’m a married man.
00:09:56.721,00:10:00.766,"Well, I just so happen to like married men."
00:10:04.062,00:10:07.773,"Really? Well, if she’s so very beautiful, why are you here with me?"
00:10:07.857,00:10:09.775,Because she’s always so tired...
00:10:09.859,00:10:13.279,and she’s always making lists of things for me to do.
00:10:13.363,00:10:16.282,Maybe if you did them she wouldn’t be so tired.
00:10:16.366,00:10:19.285,She can make lists for days.
00:10:19.369,00:10:21.746,But back to your mouth and how sexy it is.
00:10:21.830,00:10:25.166,Mm-mmm. I wanna go back to these alleged lists and your nagging wife.
00:10:25.250,00:10:27.293,I’m not talking about you.
00:10:29.712,00:10:31.630,I didn’t mean that. Can we try this again?
00:10:31.714,00:10:33.716,Yeah.
00:10:36.928,00:10:41.724,"So if your wife is so beautiful, why are you here with me?"
00:10:42.809,00:10:45.060,Because...
00:10:45.144,00:10:48.314,I respect her too much...
00:10:48.398,00:10:50.065,to do to her...
00:10:50.149,00:10:52.986,what I’m going to do to you?
00:10:54.070,00:10:56.697,"Oh, jackpot."
00:10:56.781,00:10:58.992,"I’ll be right back, Clive."
00:11:08.835,00:11:11.003,Do you have eyes on her? Is she here?
00:11:11.087,00:11:13.297,Two o’clock– blonde at the back table.
00:11:18.678,00:11:21.598,"Okay, this is it. I’m off to win the heart of my beloved."
00:11:24.183,00:11:29.230,"Well, this is nice. I mean, if we can’t have our own Valentine’s Day, it’s nice that we can give somebody else one."
00:11:29.314,00:11:30.815,"All right, Cam. I’m sorry."
00:11:30.899,00:11:32.817,I’m sor– I’m sorry I have not been attentive.
00:11:32.901,00:11:34.527,I’ve been spending the last five months...
00:11:39.616,00:11:44.578,"- Hey, buddy. How’d it go? - I can’t do it, not while Durkas is there."
00:11:44.662,00:11:47.373,He has the natural confidence. I admire it and fear it.
00:11:59.636,00:12:06.016,"In Oregon, the state legislature ratified a, uh, bill..."
00:12:06.100,00:12:09.103,that from now on it is a crime...
00:12:09.187,00:12:11.564,to have sex in Oregon with a farm animal.
00:12:13.149,00:12:16.443,How ugly are the women in Oregon?
00:12:18.988,00:12:21.991,"He’s funny, Jay."
00:12:22.075,00:12:24.201,- I can tell you’re not– you’re not from Oregon. - No.
00:12:24.285,00:12:27.329,You are gorgeous.
00:12:27.413,00:12:29.832,Thank you for bringing your father to the show.
00:12:29.916,00:12:32.418,"Oh, no. I’m her husband, Dave."
00:12:34.337,00:12:37.840,What’s it like to be married to someone who was there when the Bible was written?
00:12:42.845,00:12:46.473,"That’s, uh– That’s– That’s good stuff."
00:12:46.557,00:12:48.977,"Oh, now he’s trying to turn out the light."
00:12:55.733,00:12:57.986,Phone call. Over there.
00:13:00.113,00:13:02.031,Hello?
00:13:05.576,00:13:07.870,"with the Great Shakes corporate office, and I have good news for you."
00:13:07.954,00:13:11.498,You have been selected to take part in a random survey...
00:13:11.582,00:13:13.834,that you could win cash and prizes.
00:13:13.918,00:13:15.961,Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?
00:13:16.045,00:13:19.506,"Yeah, sure. Okay, just a few simple questions for you."
00:13:23.594,00:13:25.554,from least favorite to favorite?
00:13:25.638,00:13:29.433,- I don’t know ’em by heart. - There should be a menu right there to your right.
00:13:29.517,00:13:32.395,To your right. Mm-hmm. There you go.
00:13:38.109,00:13:40.570,I guess so. Thanks.
00:13:45.408,00:13:47.868,"Because if he does, you’ll catch him..."
00:13:47.952,00:13:50.496,when he comes home with two sets of teeth in his mouth.
00:13:50.580,00:13:52.498,Yeah.
00:13:54.917,00:13:57.754,Did he say he wanted to change into something comfortable and go into a coma?
00:13:59.213,00:14:00.673,"Listen, I gotta use the men’s room."
00:14:00.757,00:14:02.841,Nuh-uh.
00:14:02.925,00:14:05.928,Where you going? Wait a minute. I’m only joking. That’s what I do.
00:14:06.012,00:14:07.846,"You know, you’re way younger than I am."
00:14:07.930,00:14:09.766,You just don’t look it.
00:14:16.314,00:14:20.401,"Clive, I have a little something for you."
00:14:20.485,00:14:22.820,What is it?
00:14:24.614,00:14:27.408,My dress.
00:14:27.492,00:14:33.039,"Oh, my G– My underwear."
00:14:34.832,00:14:36.750,My God.
00:14:39.629,00:14:42.548,This is so much better than cheesy garlic bread.
00:14:42.632,00:14:45.217,Mmm.
00:14:45.301,00:14:47.636,Uh-huh. Go on.
00:14:47.720,00:14:49.638,Vanilla.
00:14:49.722,00:14:51.557,"Keep goin’, Mr. Durkas."
00:14:51.641,00:14:54.393,"So, why would Ted say he wrote the poem if he didn’t?"
00:15:02.902,00:15:06.989,Would you be more or less inclined to visit a Great Shakes establishment...
00:15:07.073,00:15:09.491,if you knew your satisfaction was guaranteed?
00:15:09.575,00:15:12.286,That’s a dumb question.
00:15:09.575,00:15:15.164,"Excuse me. It is not a dumb question, Mr.– Tarnation! He hung up."
00:15:19.502,00:15:22.838,Discussing poetry. Maybe you’ll like to recite some of yours.
00:15:24.841,00:15:26.842,Just admit you didn’t write the poem.
00:15:30.346,00:15:32.431,I’m going over there.
00:15:36.060,00:15:38.854,"Whoa! Whoa, sir! Sir? Turn around."
00:15:43.067,00:15:45.486,- Who are you? - I’m a lawyer.
00:15:45.570,00:15:47.446,You have a lawyer?
00:15:47.530,00:15:52.493,"It is one thing to lie, but then to bully this young man– it’s unforgivable."
00:15:52.577,00:15:54.495,And this is what’s wrong with the world today.
00:15:54.579,00:15:56.663,The big guy...
00:15:56.747,00:15:58.665,thinks that he can roll right over the little guy...
00:15:58.749,00:16:02.002,"until the little guy says, Enough."
00:16:02.086,00:16:06.340,"And that’s what this little guy’s doing– right here, right now."
00:16:08.885,00:16:10.928,Shh. I got this.
00:16:14.724,00:16:17.810,I know it. He knows it.
00:16:17.894,00:16:29.905,"Deep down in your heart, Fiona– Shame!"
00:16:29.989,00:16:31.990,Fine! Whatever. I stole his stupid poem.
00:16:35.578,00:16:40.290,"I only did it because I had the feelings, I just didn’t know how to show ’em."
00:16:40.374,00:16:45.420,Really? That’s the sweetest thing anyone’s ever done for me.
00:16:45.504,00:16:47.256,You’ve gotta be kidding me.
00:16:47.340,00:16:50.342,- Let’s get out of here. This chick’s crazy. - Seriously.
00:16:50.426,00:16:52.344,I’ve never seen you like that.
00:16:52.428,00:16:54.096,You have no idea how good that felt.
00:16:54.180,00:16:57.182,"Well, happy Valentine’s Day, counselor."
00:16:57.266,00:16:59.852,"This is all happening so fast, Juliana."
00:17:02.980,00:17:05.233,"Ooh, a twist."
00:17:07.485,00:17:10.070,"Phil! Phil, my coat is stuck."
00:17:10.154,00:17:11.822,Who’s Phil?
00:17:11.906,00:17:14.116,My coat is stuck.
00:17:14.200,00:17:16.493,Are you kidding me? Pull it.
00:17:16.577,00:17:18.871,Pull it. Come on. Come on.
00:17:25.628,00:17:27.588,Come on up. Treat ’em like they’re regular stairs.
00:17:27.672,00:17:29.381,It’s okay.
00:17:31.968,00:17:34.052,So do you. Not in a weird way. Yeah.
00:17:35.805,00:17:38.140,Happy Valentine’s– Let me just get in here. Let me get in here.
00:17:38.224,00:17:39.308,Okay?
00:17:39.392,00:17:40.976,"Hey, Tom."
00:17:41.060,00:17:45.772,"How are you? Honey– Claire, you remember Tom Mickleson from the office and his wife, Susan."
00:17:45.856,00:17:48.442,I do. Hey.
00:17:48.526,00:17:52.112,It is. It really is. It’s in there pretty darn good.
00:17:52.196,00:17:56.450,"Why don’t you take it off? Um, I’m freezing cold."
00:17:56.534,00:17:58.035,At least let me give it a shot.
00:17:58.119,00:18:00.746,"No, no, no. I got it."
00:18:00.830,00:18:02.414,Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy?
00:18:02.498,00:18:05.083,Principal Balaban.
00:18:07.753,00:18:11.006,"Oh, uh, he makes speakers."
00:18:11.090,00:18:13.467,He’s actually in town for a trade show.
00:18:16.846,00:18:19.097,Why don’t you take off that coat?
00:18:19.181,00:18:21.099,It’s really jammed in here.
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.769,"Let me in there. I’ll get you. No, I think we’re okay."
00:18:23.853,00:18:25.938,Mrs. Dunphy?
00:18:28.190,00:18:31.193,"Hi! Luke’s math teacher, Ms. Passwater."
00:18:34.613,00:18:37.449,"Ah, Jay, papi, don’t pay attention to what he’s saying."
00:18:37.533,00:18:39.952,He’s just being funny.
00:18:40.036,00:18:43.121,Those people were laughing because they saw it too.
00:18:43.205,00:18:45.499,What do you care what they think?
00:18:45.583,00:18:47.668,I care what you think.
00:18:47.752,00:18:50.295,I love you. You’re my valentine.
00:18:50.379,00:18:53.340,"But what about when I’m 80 and I’m in a wheelchair, on oxygen?"
00:18:55.051,00:18:58.345,Do you think I’m so shallow that I’m gonna leave you when you’re old?
00:18:58.429,00:19:01.182,What if I gain a hundred pounds? You gonna leave me then?
00:19:02.224,00:19:05.185,No.
00:19:05.269,00:19:08.063,"Well, it’s not exactly fair. I mean, I have to get old."
00:19:08.147,00:19:10.983,You don’t have to get fat.
00:19:11.067,00:19:13.151,"Okay, fine. And if you do, I’ll be there. You’ll see."
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.862,"Yeah, watch me. Watch me, how I get fat."
00:19:15.946,00:19:19.241,I can get fat.
00:19:22.870,00:19:24.830,You wanna go back in?
00:19:24.914,00:19:26.832,I got a better idea.
00:19:26.916,00:19:29.501,Let’s go salsa dancing. This guy’s not that funny.
00:19:33.631,00:19:35.841,We’re good! We’re good! I talked to Maintenance.
00:19:35.925,00:19:38.051,"They’re– They’re– They’re coming, so go on ahead."
00:19:38.135,00:19:40.554,See you guys. See you later.
00:19:40.638,00:19:42.681,See you in school. Good to see you guys.
00:19:42.765,00:19:44.433,Maintenance is gonna take care of it.
00:19:44.517,00:19:47.602,So we’re fine.
00:19:47.686,00:19:49.688,I was faking it. No one’s coming for us.
00:19:49.772,00:19:51.773,"Well, then, go and get them! Hurry!"
00:19:54.652,00:19:56.611,Claire! Phil!
00:19:56.695,00:19:59.448,Stand by.
00:19:59.532,00:20:01.283,Hey.
00:20:01.367,00:20:03.952,"- What, did you get your belt stuck? - I did. Yeah."
00:20:04.036,00:20:05.579,"Take your coat off. Here, let me help you."
00:20:05.663,00:20:07.539,"No, no, Dad. Dad, I’m fine."
00:20:07.623,00:20:09.250,"What are you, naked under there?"
00:20:16.132,00:20:18.092,"Claire, follow my lead, okay?"
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.970,Okay.
00:20:30.229,00:20:33.565,Thank you.
00:20:33.649,00:20:36.026,That was impressive.
00:20:41.824,00:20:43.075,All right.
00:20:44.994,00:20:46.370,Chao.
00:20:46.454,00:20:47.662,Bye.
00:20:47.746,00:20:52.501,"Oh. That’s– Sorry. See you, guys."
00:21:00.301,00:21:07.432,"Uh, Phil– Sorry I got the, uh– the oil everywhere, but, hey– Uh, sweetie– They’re not our sheets, right?"
00:21:07.516,00:21:09.601,"Honey– Honey, remember when the salesman told us..."
00:21:09.685,00:21:11.937,that the Sienna was built with the whole family in mind?
00:21:12.021,00:21:14.231,"Yeah. Well, the whole family just heard that."
00:21:14.315,00:21:18.944,Uh– Uh– Guess– I guess the Bluetooth works.
00:21:19.028,00:21:22.114,Mmm.
00:21:22.198,00:21:25.450,"Because, buddy, we were making French fries."
00:21:25.534,00:21:27.035,In your room?
00:00:02.169,00:00:04.838,What am I most afraid of? Hmm. Let’s see.
00:00:04.922,00:00:07.924,Global warming... and getting a B.
00:00:08.008,00:00:10.927,The phone ringing in the middle of the night.
00:00:11.011,00:00:13.680,That I’m too much of a perfectionist.
00:00:13.764,00:00:15.682,"Honey, this isn’t a job interview."
00:00:17.768,00:00:19.686,Job interviews.
00:00:19.770,00:00:22.814,Nothing.
00:00:22.898,00:00:26.025,"Oh, I don’t like them. They’re shifty."
00:00:26.109,00:00:29.487,Losing Mitchell.
00:00:29.571,00:00:32.532,Hotel bedspreads. Ooh.
00:00:32.616,00:00:34.534,Never getting my driver’s license.
00:00:34.618,00:00:36.954,Or getting one and the picture sucks.
00:00:39.957,00:00:42.542,"Oh, Haley, sweetie, did you find your shoes?"
00:00:42.626,00:00:45.295,"Mom, please, not today."
00:00:45.379,00:00:48.131,Why are you hounding me? I’m freaking out right now.
00:00:48.215,00:00:50.717,You need to relax. It’s just a driver’s test.
00:00:50.801,00:00:56.139,"It’s my third driver’s test, and if I fail again, I have to wait six months to retake it."
00:00:56.223,00:00:58.975,That’s six more months of you driving me everywhere.
00:00:59.059,00:01:03.730,"Then I’m, like, There’s no way I’m wearing that. And she was, like– Like."
00:01:05.899,00:01:08.151,"And then she was, like, Well, if you don’t play– Like! Like!"
00:01:08.235,00:01:09.903,Mom! Stop!
00:01:09.987,00:01:12.488,You’re embarrassing me! Stop it!
00:01:12.572,00:01:13.907,Hmm.
00:01:13.991,00:01:16.242,Haley. Found your jacket.
00:01:16.326,00:01:20.038,Why is everyone on me? God!
00:01:20.122,00:01:22.665,Ignore her. She can’t focus on two things at once.
00:01:22.749,00:01:25.251,Always a good quality in a driver.
00:01:25.335,00:01:27.921,"Sweetie, we need to get you some shoes for the dance tonight."
00:01:28.005,00:01:30.590,"No, we don’t. I’m not going."
00:01:30.674,00:01:32.550,Why would you not be going to the dance?
00:01:34.511,00:01:38.389,A bunch of immature boys trying to impress you with how cool they are...
00:01:38.473,00:01:40.433,when they’re really just a bunch of dorks.
00:01:42.602,00:01:44.312,Yes.
00:01:49.359,00:01:51.611,"A few days ago, the cable guy was under the house."
00:01:51.695,00:01:57.116,"When he was leaving, he said to Haley, Wow. That’s quite a collection you’ve got down there."
00:01:57.200,00:02:01.537,Here’s the thing. We have no idea what he’s talking about.
00:02:01.621,00:02:05.458,"All week, Luke and I have been getting more and more excited about what it could be."
00:02:05.542,00:02:08.294,I bet it’s really cool old magazines.
00:02:08.378,00:02:12.173,Yeah. Or a bunch of necklaces made out of animal teeth.
00:02:12.257,00:02:14.467,Or bugs frozen in amber.
00:02:14.551,00:02:18.471,What if it’s really expensive bottles of wine? Or a suit of armor.
00:02:18.555,00:02:22.767,What if there’s ancient Indian arrowheads under there?
00:02:25.979,00:02:29.066,"For God sakes, why don’t you go under the house and look?"
00:02:46.541,00:02:48.960,"Hey, Cam. Cam, where did we get this dolly from?"
00:02:49.044,00:02:52.213,From Janice and Olivia. They brought it over yesterday. Lily loves it.
00:02:52.297,00:02:55.508,"Seems a little frilly, you know, coming from them."
00:03:02.349,00:03:05.393,No. It was too big. They were on their motorcycle.
00:03:05.477,00:03:10.898,"We got off to an awkward start with our pediatrician, a very nice Asian lady– Irrelevant."
00:03:10.982,00:03:13.651,So I took the bold step of inviting her over for brunch.
00:03:16.113,00:03:17.905,She said no patient had ever done it before.
00:03:17.989,00:03:20.325,"Yeah. Subtext, This is weird."
00:03:20.409,00:03:22.785,I didn’t hear any subtext.
00:03:22.869,00:03:24.871,Do you hear any now?
00:03:29.000,00:03:31.961,Because what if Lily gets sick and there’s a Tamiflu shortage?
00:03:32.045,00:03:33.755,Who do you think’s gonna get that medicine?
00:03:33.839,00:03:35.506,"The patient she likes, that’s who."
00:03:35.590,00:03:38.301,"Well, maybe if you bake her a cake, she’ll give us free X-rays."
00:03:38.385,00:03:39.886,It’s all about making connections.
00:03:39.970,00:03:42.138,Why do you think the dentist gives me all that free stuff?
00:03:42.222,00:03:45.600,"Um, because he’s a huge queen and he has a big crush on you."
00:03:51.189,00:03:54.108,"- I have a fever. - Ay, mi amor. Come here and I feel you."
00:03:54.192,00:03:56.819,Ooh. I don’t wanna get you sick. It could be fatal.
00:03:56.903,00:03:58.905,"Then by all means, stand next to me."
00:03:58.989,00:04:00.949,Let me feel you.
00:04:02.242,00:04:04.410,"Ay, papi, but you’re not warm."
00:04:04.494,00:04:08.373,"Uh, probably because you were cooking and your hands are warm."
00:04:08.457,00:04:11.125,I better skip the party tomorrow just to be safe.
00:04:11.209,00:04:14.087,"Oh. Yeah, the party."
00:04:15.088,00:04:17.673,What?
00:04:17.757,00:04:20.927,I understand about 20% of what goes on around here.
00:04:21.011,00:04:26.349,"The party is at an amusement park, and Manny’s afraid of roller coasters."
00:04:26.433,00:04:28.351,I don’t know where he gets his fear from...
00:04:28.435,00:04:30.353,because his father’s not afraid of anything.
00:04:30.437,00:04:36.109,"No bulls, no heights, no helicopters, no fast cars– But go to dinner with him and wait for the check to come."
00:04:36.193,00:04:38.403,Then you’ll see fear in his eyes.
00:04:38.487,00:04:40.947,Like the waiter’s a ghost.
00:04:41.031,00:04:43.408,Excited?
00:04:47.871,00:04:50.706,Who’s that?
00:04:50.790,00:04:54.377,His name was Ponce? He’d get made fun of at my school.
00:04:54.461,00:04:57.255,They’d probably call him Pants.
00:04:59.341,00:05:01.509,"Or maybe, um, Fancy Ponce."
00:05:03.512,00:05:05.013,All right.
00:05:09.309,00:05:11.436,"You okay, Dad?"
00:05:11.520,00:05:14.480,Yep. Gonna take a little more than getting trapped...
00:05:14.564,00:05:17.150,"in a small, dark space with a wild animal to rattle your old man."
00:05:19.486,00:05:23.698,You wanna be that rock that they can grab ahold of in a stormy sea.
00:05:23.782,00:05:26.868,"Actually, a rock would sink. So a floating rock."
00:05:26.952,00:05:31.122,"Let’s start over. It’s windy, and you’ve got a lot of papers."
00:05:31.206,00:05:34.500,"Okay. Let’s do this, buddy."
00:05:37.921,00:05:39.881,Okay! Good recon.
00:05:39.965,00:05:44.677,"Got the lay of the land, so– Aren’t we going in?"
00:05:44.761,00:05:49.474,But won’t it be fun if we did it with ski goggles and barbecue tools?
00:05:49.558,00:05:51.684,I guess.
00:05:51.768,00:05:54.271,Yeah. Let’s do that.
00:05:56.731,00:05:59.066,Can I just say that is a lovely outfit.
00:05:59.150,00:06:02.195,Oh. Thank you.
00:06:02.279,00:06:04.447,You actually have quite a nice figure.
00:06:04.531,00:06:07.742,"Take it down a notch. We’re trying to make a friend, not initiate a three-way."
00:06:08.868,00:06:11.204,Oh.
00:06:18.962,00:06:20.630,Don’t worry. She’s perfect.
00:06:20.714,00:06:23.758,"Aren’t you, Lily?"
00:06:23.842,00:06:25.760,She’s usually very fidgety around new people.
00:06:25.844,00:06:28.262,"Well, I just think she senses you’re gonna be a good friend for her..."
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.267,Mommy.
00:06:33.351,00:06:41.526,"Did she just– Did she just say– Well, her first word..."
00:06:41.610,00:06:43.819,was every gay father’s worst nightmare.
00:06:43.903,00:06:45.822,Mommy.
00:06:48.908,00:06:54.664,"Jay, he won’t admit it, but I know that Manny’s sad because he’s missing the party."
00:06:54.748,00:06:57.416,"Why don’t we take him somewhere to take his mind off it, hmm?"
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.418,I could have guessed he’d have trouble with roller coasters.
00:07:02.672,00:07:05.967,"How about we take him to the pier and go fishing, huh? Manny!"
00:07:06.051,00:07:08.094,He likes to fish?
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.935,"- Manny, you like to fish? - Fishing? Yeah."
00:07:16.019,00:07:17.979,You want to go to the pier today?
00:07:18.063,00:07:21.774,Is this a trick to see if I’m really sick?
00:07:24.611,00:07:29.323,"Well, then yeah, ’cause there’s no place where I’m more at one with– Just get your coat."
00:07:29.407,00:07:31.325,Are you nervous?
00:07:31.409,00:07:33.828,I was just asking. I’d be nervous if I were you.
00:07:36.039,00:07:38.332,As long as I don’t get the same guy. He’s so mean.
00:07:38.416,00:07:39.917,You probably will.
00:07:40.001,00:07:42.128,He hates me.
00:07:42.212,00:07:44.505,He yelled at me.
00:07:47.509,00:07:49.886,Please don’t be for me. Please don’t be me. Hi.
00:07:51.596,00:07:53.723,"Oh, thank God."
00:07:53.807,00:07:57.476,"Well, come on. I don’t have all day."
00:07:57.560,00:08:00.730,I’m gonna throw up.
00:08:00.814,00:08:02.898,"You’re gonna get in that car, put on your seat belt..."
00:08:02.982,00:08:05.192,and take three deep breaths and relax.
00:08:05.276,00:08:07.486,This guy sees hundreds of kids every day.
00:08:07.570,00:08:09.572,"He probably doesn’t even remember you, all right?"
00:08:09.656,00:08:12.325,"Yo. Let’s move it, two strikes."
00:08:14.869,00:08:17.539,"That’s more than three breaths, honey."
00:08:19.582,00:08:22.251,See how much better this is?
00:08:22.335,00:08:24.253,The truck goes in. It gets video.
00:08:24.337,00:08:27.006,"And then we get a preview of whatever’s in there. How ingenious is that, huh?"
00:08:27.090,00:08:29.634,Are you just scared to go in?
00:08:29.718,00:08:31.677,Why would you say that?
00:08:31.761,00:08:34.263,"Well, when you stuck your head in, you screamed a little."
00:08:36.349,00:08:40.102,"Besides, this is so much cooler. This is how NASA does it."
00:08:40.186,00:08:43.022,"Now, hand me the Itty Bitty Book Light."
00:08:43.106,00:08:46.942,Yeah. Final piece of the puzzle.
00:08:55.702,00:08:57.203,"Hey, Dad?"
00:08:57.287,00:08:59.914,How are you supposed to steer if you don’t know where you’re going?
00:08:59.998,00:09:03.668,"Stay in the present, buddy. Gotta do it by feel."
00:09:03.752,00:09:05.879,Gotta get all Jedi on it.
00:09:18.183,00:09:19.975,- Did you just lose my truck? - No.
00:09:20.059,00:09:21.686,You just lost my truck!
00:09:21.770,00:09:23.729,That was my truck! Grandpa just gave it to me!
00:09:23.813,00:09:26.483,- I told you to stay in the present! - Stop yelling!
00:09:29.694,00:09:32.614,- Truce? - Yeah. Sorry.
00:09:35.742,00:09:37.660,This is delicious.
00:09:44.334,00:09:48.587,"Look, I don’t even think she said the M word."
00:09:52.926,00:09:56.053,I quit my job so I could stay at home with her.
00:09:57.847,00:10:02.893,Maybe we’re not providing her with the feminine energy that she needs.
00:10:08.525,00:10:10.693,"You– You know it’s because you’re Asian, right?"
00:10:10.777,00:10:12.695,Cam.
00:10:12.779,00:10:16.574,Am I just supposed to ignore the giant panda in the room?
00:10:16.658,00:10:19.452,"Pandas are from China. I– Well, it doesn’t matter."
00:10:19.536,00:10:32.465,"Okay, okay. I think what my hysterical partner is just trying to say, if I may, that for the first six months of her life, Lily was raised by very loving Asian women, in an orphanage, with whom she clearly bonded."
00:10:32.549,00:10:36.343,And then suddenly you come in with all of your Asian-ness...
00:10:36.427,00:10:46.353,"and-and-and breasts and womb, lady bits– and it all just comes rushing back to her, and I– You guys are overreacting."
00:10:46.437,00:10:52.693,"I’m sure Lily just strung a couple of random syllables together, and they happen to sound something like that word."
00:10:52.777,00:10:55.738,But that’s all.
00:10:57.448,00:10:59.825,- Do you really think that? - Of course.
00:11:10.253,00:11:12.963,"- Mr. Tucker– - Okay. No, no, no."
00:11:15.425,00:11:17.885,"All right, left turn."
00:11:17.969,00:11:20.471,"At the intersection, yeah."
00:11:20.555,00:11:22.765,Left.
00:11:28.521,00:11:31.274,"- No, I can do this! - Pull over now."
00:11:33.151,00:11:36.654,- Why are you crying? - Why do you hate me?
00:11:36.738,00:11:39.782,"Oh, hell. Haley, I don’t hate you."
00:11:39.866,00:11:42.910,You seem like a nice girl. You remind me of my daughter.
00:11:50.168,00:11:52.378,I really want my license.
00:11:55.173,00:11:57.049,"- You gonna drink and drive? - No, sir."
00:11:57.133,00:11:59.802,"- You gonna text and drive? - No, sir."
00:11:59.886,00:12:03.306,All right. Let’s start this from the beginning.
00:12:04.641,00:12:07.518,Could you smile first?
00:12:17.362,00:12:18.905,Just go.
00:12:25.662,00:12:27.621,"Hey, Jay, did I ever tell you about the time..."
00:12:27.705,00:12:31.417,I used peanut butter and jelly for bait and I caught a thresher shark?
00:12:33.836,00:12:36.046,Why are we going this way?
00:12:36.130,00:12:37.965,It’s just another way to go.
00:12:38.049,00:12:39.675,Uh-oh. Something’s going on.
00:12:39.759,00:12:42.428,What are you talking about?
00:12:42.512,00:12:44.638,She’s trying to get me on that roller coaster.
00:12:46.349,00:12:48.559,"No, she’s not."
00:12:50.395,00:12:52.605,"Manny, you have to face your fears."
00:12:52.689,00:12:56.108,That’s why we’re here? Why didn’t you let me in on your little plan?
00:12:56.192,00:12:58.736,Because you’re the worst liar. He would have seen right through you.
00:12:58.820,00:13:00.779,I don’t wanna go on the roller coaster.
00:13:00.863,00:13:05.451,"Manny, you were afraid to light the barbecue, but now your eyebrows have grown back..."
00:13:05.535,00:13:07.661,and your salmon is legendary.
00:13:07.745,00:13:10.122,What if I fall out?
00:13:10.206,00:13:12.833,That’s not possible. He would crush you.
00:13:12.917,00:13:14.418,What if I throw up?
00:13:14.502,00:13:16.503,I will clean it up. It wouldn’t be the first time.
00:13:16.587,00:13:18.964,"Geez, these are new shoes."
00:13:19.048,00:13:20.591,"You’re not gonna let up, are you?"
00:13:30.059,00:13:32.811,"No, I’m not going on that. That’s bad for my back."
00:13:32.895,00:13:35.731,Your back is fine.
00:13:35.815,00:13:38.817,"Oh, please. Don’t tell me you’re scared too."
00:13:38.901,00:13:40.819,What is this scared stuff?
00:13:44.407,00:13:47.993,"Well, if he’s not going, I’m not going."
00:13:48.077,00:13:49.870,"Oh, for God’s sake, fine! I’ll go alone."
00:13:49.954,00:13:56.586,"Here. Take my girlie purse and you my floppy hat, and if you need it, there’s the ladies’ room."
00:13:59.464,00:14:01.716,I’m not man enough to fight this.
00:14:03.634,00:14:05.762,Here. Hold my purse.
00:14:08.514,00:14:10.516,"Oh, hell!"
00:14:15.480,00:14:17.940,What’s taking them so long?
00:14:21.986,00:14:24.697,"You know, honey, I think I know why you don’t wanna go tonight."
00:14:24.781,00:14:26.949,Because school dances are lame?
00:14:27.033,00:14:29.201,’Cause you don’t know how to dance.
00:14:29.285,00:14:32.037,I can help you with that. Come on. Come on.
00:14:32.121,00:14:34.540,"Oh, yeah. Back in the day, I was quite the dancer."
00:14:34.624,00:14:36.792,"Oh, my God. You and Dad together suddenly makes so much sense."
00:14:42.632,00:14:44.883,I just don’t wanna be part of that freak show.
00:14:44.967,00:14:48.637,"Sweetheart, you’re a beautiful girl. Someone will ask you to dance."
00:14:50.723,00:14:53.600,Somebody will ask you.
00:14:56.395,00:14:58.397,But what if they don’t?
00:14:58.481,00:15:03.736,"Honey, if they don’t, then you do the exact same thing I told your sister, okay?"
00:15:03.820,00:15:06.280,Take three deep breaths and relax.
00:15:06.364,00:15:08.407,Even the advice I get is a hand-me-down.
00:15:08.491,00:15:11.577,"Mom, I did it! I passed!"
00:15:11.661,00:15:13.120,Oh!
00:15:13.204,00:15:14.496,I got my license!
00:15:14.580,00:15:16.457,I have my license! I got my license!
00:15:16.541,00:15:18.584,Car’s not in park.
00:15:20.670,00:15:22.672,Go. Right now.
00:15:26.342,00:15:30.095,Still can’t believe you lost my truck.
00:15:30.179,00:15:34.141,"You know, maybe it’s better we don’t solve this little mystery."
00:15:34.225,00:15:41.273,"Sometimes treasure’s more sparkly in your imagination, where it could be gold or baseball cards or pirate maps."
00:15:44.861,00:15:47.279,I’m a hundred percent sure it’s possible.
00:15:47.363,00:15:50.866,All right. I’m going in.
00:15:55.371,00:15:57.664,Really? Buddy.
00:15:57.748,00:15:59.709,Whoa.
00:16:01.711,00:16:04.838,What do you see?
00:16:04.922,00:16:07.508,Wait a minute. I think I see my truck.
00:16:07.592,00:16:09.927,It’s right over there by the– Uh-oh.
00:16:15.892,00:16:18.393,And it’s hot.
00:16:18.477,00:16:20.562,"Dad, it’s hot! Hurry!"
00:16:20.646,00:16:23.232,"I’m coming, buddy!"
00:16:26.319,00:16:28.237,Coming!
00:16:28.321,00:16:30.280,I’m sorry if we got all weird in there.
00:16:30.364,00:16:32.282,No. It was fine.
00:16:32.366,00:16:37.329,"Well, we’d like to say it’s different than how it usually is, but you’ve seen us enough to know that that’s not true."
00:16:37.413,00:16:41.041,"Guys, listen. I had a very complicated relationship with my mother."
00:16:44.420,00:16:47.548,She didn’t want me to become a doctor. She wanted me to get married and have kids.
00:16:47.632,00:16:50.467,"But my father, we would talk..."
00:16:50.551,00:16:53.220,and he would actually listen to what I wanted.
00:16:53.304,00:16:55.305,"Anyway, what I’m trying to say..."
00:16:55.389,00:16:58.892,is having a mother isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be.
00:17:01.979,00:17:06.358,"And if you ask me, having two fathers who care as much as you do..."
00:17:10.696,00:17:12.656,That’s very sweet. Thanks.
00:17:12.740,00:17:15.242,And how are things with you and your mom now?
00:17:15.326,00:17:20.038,Uh– The only way she’ll be happy is if I’m some Asian stereotype.
00:17:20.122,00:17:23.084,But that just isn’t me.
00:17:34.303,00:17:36.680,"I’m coming, buddy."
00:17:47.483,00:17:49.234,"Yes, it does."
00:17:49.318,00:17:51.153,Everything’s gonna be okay.
00:17:55.157,00:17:57.451,There.
00:17:57.535,00:18:00.078,"Hey, that’s what dads do. Let’s get out of here."
00:18:00.162,00:18:02.831,I want my truck.
00:18:02.915,00:18:04.958,It was a Christmas gift.
00:18:05.042,00:18:07.044,Could you go get it?
00:18:10.423,00:18:13.634,Sure. Let’s go– Let’s go through it.
00:18:16.429,00:18:18.848,Yeah. There it is.
00:18:22.393,00:18:24.311,Got it.
00:18:27.690,00:18:30.692,You know what? I am okay.
00:18:30.776,00:18:32.277,Hey.
00:18:32.361,00:18:34.696,We did it.
00:18:37.575,00:18:40.327,What the heck. We’re down here.
00:18:40.411,00:18:43.705,"Why don’t we see what we got, huh?"
00:18:43.789,00:18:46.875,Two intrepid explorers...
00:18:55.885,00:19:01.139,"Turns out it was the last owner’s Halloween decorations, which is pretty funny."
00:19:01.223,00:19:03.475,Least I thought it was.
00:19:03.559,00:19:06.520,"Everybody’s afraid of something, right?"
00:19:14.445,00:19:17.823,I did it!
00:19:17.907,00:19:20.242,But then there’s our children.
00:19:20.326,00:19:22.578,Will they fit in?
00:19:26.624,00:19:28.751,Will they be safe?
00:19:29.835,00:19:32.045,Those are fears you never get past.
00:19:32.129,00:19:35.299,So sometimes all you can do...
00:19:38.719,00:19:41.430,and hope for the best.
00:19:41.514,00:19:43.015,- Bye! - Eyes on the road.
00:19:43.099,00:19:45.017,- Love you! - Eyes on the road.
00:19:46.685,00:19:50.188,"I mean, things don’t always work out."
00:19:50.272,00:19:52.566,"Oh. Cam, I think she wants her doll."
00:19:57.696,00:19:59.698,Mommy.
00:20:00.699,00:20:02.617,Mommy.
00:20:02.701,00:20:04.578,"When you squeeze the doll, it says Mommy."
00:20:04.662,00:20:06.788,Did-Did you know that– Not a clue.
00:20:09.208,00:20:11.626,The doll says Mommy.
00:20:20.177,00:20:21.720,"Hey, Dad."
00:20:21.804,00:20:23.930,Mom says there’s an old trunk in the attic.
00:20:24.014,00:20:26.058,"Oh, yeah. My grandpa’s old steamer trunk."
00:20:26.142,00:20:29.019,"In this movie I saw, there was this old trunk..."
00:20:29.103,00:20:31.063,and there’s a secret compartment.
00:20:31.147,00:20:36.610,"And when you opened it, there was a whole bunch of paintings, by the world’s greatest painters, hidden in the war."
00:20:36.694,00:20:39.654,My grandpa was in the war.
00:20:39.738,00:20:42.324,Should we go up there?
00:20:42.408,00:20:46.328,Or a samurai sword.
00:20:50.666,00:20:53.752,What matters is what you do with the money from what’s up there.
00:20:57.298,00:21:00.509,Or an indoor pool.
00:00:02.211,00:00:03.670,"Hey, honey, Hugh Grant has a– I’m in."
00:00:03.754,00:00:06.923,"Okay, well, Alex has a cello lesson at 11:00..."
00:00:07.007,00:00:08.925,and Junior Congress at noon.
00:00:09.009,00:00:11.010,Doesn’t she also have no boys at forever?
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.471,Don’t you have an eating disorder you need to attend to?
00:00:13.555,00:00:17.350,"Yeah, anyway, uh, we could see the 4:00 or the 6:20."
00:00:17.434,00:00:20.019,"Oh, actually, that’s no good. I’m meeting my friend Denise for a drink."
00:00:23.106,00:00:26.067,"Oh, my God. Gross. I can’t even picture you with a woman."
00:00:26.151,00:00:28.695,- Thank you. - You had a girlfriend before Mom?
00:00:32.616,00:00:34.075,And then I met your mom.
00:00:34.159,00:00:35.786,And thank you.
00:00:41.625,00:00:44.878,- She’s in town for a week. - She’s like a door-to-door salesman?
00:00:48.799,00:00:52.302,Oh! My boy strikes like a rattlesnake!
00:00:52.386,00:00:57.849,"Oh, yeah? W-Well, you– Wow. All right, well, we can see the movie tomorrow."
00:00:57.933,00:00:59.893,Come on. It’s time for your lesson.
00:01:05.691,00:01:09.402,What’s wrong with me today?
00:01:15.200,00:01:18.077,"Ay, you’re still sad because of that audition."
00:01:18.161,00:01:20.622,That part was mine. I was born to play Tevye.
00:01:20.706,00:01:22.457,Instead they give it to Rod Jackson?
00:01:22.541,00:01:24.459,What does he know from suffering?
00:01:24.543,00:01:26.461,- How we doing? - A little better.
00:01:26.545,00:01:28.963,But we’re gonna go and throw ice cream at the problem.
00:01:29.047,00:01:32.008,"Well, if that doesn’t work, this should do the trick."
00:01:32.092,00:01:34.469,What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
00:01:34.553,00:01:37.847,"We can hang this in your room. You can see it every morning, start to internalize it."
00:01:37.931,00:01:40.266,- Pretty soon nothing will keep you down. - But it’s not true.
00:01:43.520,00:01:45.438,My friend’s grandfather had a heart attack.
00:01:47.274,00:01:49.108,I’ve seen him– at the supermarket.
00:01:52.279,00:01:56.324,"- That’s right. Be negative. - It’s just not a good poster, Jay."
00:01:56.408,00:01:58.410,You’re only making me stronger.
00:02:11.048,00:02:13.841,Did you pack the bread for the ducks?
00:02:13.925,00:02:15.927,Not the whole-wheat kind. The ducks don’t like that.
00:02:16.011,00:02:17.470,"They’re ducks, Mitchell. They don’t care."
00:02:17.554,00:02:20.640,We both believe that animals should play a big part in Lily’s life.
00:02:23.226,00:02:26.355,"They were more like brothers and sisters than just, you know, livestock."
00:02:27.564,00:02:29.190,Delicious brothers and sisters.
00:02:29.274,00:02:31.485,Life on a farm– they know what they’re getting into.
00:02:36.239,00:02:38.157,"Oh, it’s the office."
00:02:38.241,00:02:40.785,I have to.
00:02:40.869,00:02:43.580,"Well, maybe it’s not that this time. Hello?"
00:02:45.749,00:02:47.917,Yeah.
00:02:55.258,00:02:56.760,That’s nice.
00:03:04.309,00:03:07.103,"Oh, hell."
00:03:11.400,00:03:13.526,"Oh, she’s laughing. I can’t believe you’re missing this."
00:03:13.610,00:03:15.570,"Well, why not, Cam? I’ve missed everything else."
00:03:15.654,00:03:17.655,She rolled over when I was in Phoenix.
00:03:17.739,00:03:19.699,She started scooting when I was in court.
00:03:19.783,00:03:23.328,"Well, just tell ’em you’re not coming in. You do enough for ’em."
00:03:23.412,00:03:26.748,"Well, you know that. I know that. You know?"
00:03:26.832,00:03:30.418,The only one who doesn’t know that is my sucky boss.
00:03:30.502,00:03:33.212,He’s the suckiest suck of all time.
00:03:33.296,00:03:36.507,He’s a miserable son of a bitch who...
00:03:36.591,00:03:40.011,may have heard everything I just said.
00:03:46.518,00:03:48.519,"Hi, honey."
00:03:48.603,00:03:50.229,When are you getting together with your gal pal?
00:03:55.444,00:03:59.405,Sure am. She’s one of my 447 friends.
00:03:59.489,00:04:01.491,Everybody wants a slice.
00:04:01.575,00:04:03.493,How long have you two been in touch with each other?
00:04:03.577,00:04:05.620,"Uh, she tracked me down about a year ago."
00:04:08.165,00:04:09.665,What? What’s– What’s that sound?
00:04:14.796,00:04:19.008,How about we meet at Le Reve at 7:30?
00:04:19.092,00:04:24.639,That sounds innocent enough– I mean– drinks with an ex-girlfriend at an intimate French restaurant.
00:04:24.723,00:04:27.225,"Honey, you’re doing that thing where you say what I want you to say..."
00:04:29.019,00:04:32.438,Let me guess. Denise isn’t married.
00:04:37.569,00:04:41.364,"Seriously, women in their 30s on the Internet are like– they’re like ninjas."
00:04:46.203,00:04:48.037,Here. Read some of her messages.
00:04:48.121,00:04:50.957,You’re gonna feel silly.
00:04:51.041,00:04:55.044,You can’t add the sexy voice.
00:04:59.257,00:05:02.510,Are you seriously jealous?
00:05:02.594,00:05:06.472,"I just happen to know women better than you do, and that woman wants a slice."
00:05:06.556,00:05:10.184,"Okay. Just to prove how wrong you are, I’m gonna invite her over here for drinks."
00:05:10.268,00:05:13.020,Fine with me. Just hope it’s fine with Denise.
00:05:16.733,00:05:18.734,That voice doesn’t bother me.
00:05:18.818,00:05:20.736,Kind of like it!
00:05:28.245,00:05:30.914,And where are you? I only have a half hour for lunch.
00:05:32.249,00:05:35.084,"- Hello, handsome. - So this is where it happened."
00:05:35.168,00:05:38.921,"Just turn off the phone, roll down the window and we’ll see if you can hear me."
00:05:44.761,00:05:48.389,Thank you.
00:05:48.473,00:05:50.600,"Yeah, but just barely. Is this how loud you were talking?"
00:05:54.437,00:05:55.730,- You almost had to what? - Shout.
00:05:55.814,00:05:57.273,- Little bit louder now. - Shout.
00:05:57.357,00:05:58.858,- Little bit louder now. - Shout!
00:06:00.986,00:06:06.574,"Really, Cam? My job is at stake here, and– Oh, who are we kidding? You can obviously hear me."
00:06:10.453,00:06:13.039,"Manny? Manny, come here a second, pal."
00:06:13.123,00:06:15.416,"- Huh? - I got some bad news, buddy."
00:06:15.500,00:06:18.795,What is it?
00:06:19.963,00:06:23.716,- Shel Turtlestein is dead. - What? How?
00:06:23.800,00:06:27.011,"I was down here reading the paper, and I heard this commotion up in your room."
00:06:27.095,00:06:30.598,"So– So naturally, I go running up there."
00:06:30.682,00:06:33.726,And this mangy raccoon had busted through your screen.
00:06:33.810,00:06:35.895,He must have scampered up to where Shel was.
00:06:38.148,00:06:41.901,"By the time I walked in, he had– the little bastard had him by the neck and shaking him."
00:06:41.985,00:06:44.779,Gravel was flying everywhere.
00:06:44.863,00:06:47.615,He didn’t even flinch. He just stared at me with that smug look...
00:06:47.699,00:06:49.617,and then bolted.
00:06:49.701,00:06:51.703,If only I’d have got here earlier.
00:06:53.246,00:06:55.206,May I see the body?
00:06:55.290,00:06:58.168,"Baby, are you sure that’s a good idea? It’s something I have to do."
00:07:01.004,00:07:03.214,That’s him.
00:07:06.176,00:07:09.470,"But in school, we learn raccoons are nocturnal. They sleep during the day."
00:07:09.554,00:07:12.139,"They sure do, and this one must’ve got up for a midnight snack."
00:07:12.223,00:07:13.724,"You know, we’ve all done that."
00:07:13.808,00:07:15.268,I guess so.
00:07:15.352,00:07:16.852,It all adds up.
00:07:16.936,00:07:20.356,I don’t think I can be in here right now. Too many memories.
00:07:25.737,00:07:29.365,I’m Colombian. I know a fake crime scene when I see one.
00:07:29.449,00:07:33.744,I was hanging up the new poster and it fell on top of him.
00:07:33.828,00:07:35.663,It was an accident.
00:07:35.747,00:07:37.665,No. I’ve been through this before.
00:07:37.749,00:07:40.293,"When Mitchell was nine, I was supposed to take care of his bird."
00:07:40.377,00:07:44.338,It got out and flew into a fan. It was like a bloody pillow fight.
00:07:44.422,00:07:46.799,My God. How many pets have you killed?
00:07:48.885,00:07:53.973,"To this day, Mitchell looks at me, I see him thinking, That’s the guy who killed Fliza Minnelli."
00:07:54.057,00:07:55.975,And what if he finds out? Then what?
00:07:56.059,00:07:58.644,You’ll be the guy that killed his pet and lied to him.
00:08:01.731,00:08:03.900,Okay.
00:08:04.901,00:08:06.152,Fliza Minnelli?
00:08:10.990,00:08:12.617,"Hey, Luke."
00:08:12.701,00:08:14.493,"Big day for you, huh? Why?"
00:08:14.577,00:08:17.330,- Because you will get to meet your real mom. - What?
00:08:20.583,00:08:24.670,But that’s the real reason Dad’s old girlfriend’s coming over.
00:08:24.754,00:08:28.382,"She’s your mom, and if she likes you, you’ll go live with her."
00:08:28.466,00:08:31.385,I’m not adopted. I’m asking Mom.
00:08:31.469,00:08:35.014,You mean Mrs. Dunphy? She’s not going to tell you the truth.
00:08:35.098,00:08:38.935,I-I’m not– I know.
00:08:41.938,00:08:46.525,Just ’cause he called you a dork-to-dork salesman?
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.863,Raccoons have five toes.
00:08:50.947,00:08:53.532,What’s that?
00:08:57.495,00:08:59.830,"You know, I bet I know what happened."
00:08:59.914,00:09:02.875,I’ll bet he lost those toes in a fight.
00:09:02.959,00:09:05.419,And that guy looked like he’d been in a brawl or two.
00:09:05.503,00:09:07.963,- One toe from each foot? - Maybe.
00:09:08.047,00:09:10.549,"You know, Manny, I think the only thing..."
00:09:10.633,00:09:13.469,that’s gonna get you to stop asking all these questions...
00:09:13.553,00:09:15.471,is for you to have a little closure.
00:09:15.555,00:09:18.724,"- What do you mean? - Well, I’d like to throw a little memorial for Shel."
00:09:18.808,00:09:27.025,"It’ll be good for all of us. That way we get our grief out, and then we never have to talk about this ever, ever again."
00:09:32.113,00:09:34.490,"Hi. Oh, careful. There’s a thing."
00:09:34.574,00:09:36.492,Yeah. Good to see you.
00:09:36.576,00:09:38.494,Hi!
00:09:38.578,00:09:40.663,"Hi! Oh, my God."
00:09:40.747,00:09:42.665,You must be– Oh.
00:09:42.749,00:09:44.667,Denise.
00:09:44.751,00:09:47.962,You’re even prettier than the pictures that Phil’s always posting.
00:09:48.046,00:09:49.964,- Just a couple. - Oh?
00:09:50.048,00:09:52.383,Shut up. Every week. He loves showing you off.
00:09:55.887,00:09:58.431,"Well, thank your boyfriend for me."
00:09:58.515,00:09:59.932,"Come on in, please."
00:10:00.016,00:10:04.019,"Oh, I brought you, um, some lifting intensifier."
00:10:04.103,00:10:07.940,"- Not that you need it. It’s a limited edition, so– - Thank you. Thank you."
00:10:08.024,00:10:10.276,"Oh, Denise, I think you might know these people."
00:10:10.360,00:10:11.819,"Uh, that’s Haley– Hi."
00:10:11.903,00:10:14.655,- Alex and– - Luke. Oh!
00:10:19.035,00:10:21.120,So? That doesn’t mean anything.
00:10:27.544,00:10:29.545,So what was my dad like in high school?
00:10:29.629,00:10:32.381,Only the most amazing break-dancer ever.
00:10:32.465,00:10:35.509,"Oh, don’t fire it up. What? What?"
00:10:35.593,00:10:37.136,"Oh, no."
00:10:37.220,00:10:39.555,He had a boom box and a piece of cardboard in his locker.
00:10:41.724,00:10:43.642,I drove him to his Star Search audition.
00:10:46.604,00:10:50.357,- That is dead-ass funny. I’m so calling you that. - Thank you.
00:10:52.777,00:10:55.237,"You have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous house."
00:10:55.321,00:10:58.115,And those kids– I could take Luke home with me.
00:11:00.243,00:11:02.578,"Seriously, you go right ahead."
00:11:02.662,00:11:05.539,No! I like it here!
00:11:08.334,00:11:10.836,"Alex, honey, will you go find out what’s wrong with your brother?"
00:11:10.920,00:11:12.838,Okay.
00:11:12.922,00:11:18.511,"You know, um, if it’s okay, I think I’m just gonna use the, um– Oh, yeah. Of course. Down the hall."
00:11:18.595,00:11:21.014,Left-hand side. You can’t miss it. Thanks.
00:11:23.933,00:11:25.935,"Okay, she’s fantastic."
00:11:26.019,00:11:29.814,Yes. I feel awful. When did I become this horribly cynical person...
00:11:29.898,00:11:31.857,who assumes the worst about people?
00:11:37.488,00:11:40.033,"Oh, I’ll show you. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:45.455,00:11:47.540,I thought I’d just point at the door.
00:11:47.624,00:11:50.501,So I was thinking– I was thinking too.
00:11:50.585,00:11:54.380,Here... is my hotel room key.
00:11:54.464,00:11:56.799,You can come by whenever you want.
00:12:11.314,00:12:14.275,- Funny? - Yeah. Because I was on the phone with my partner...
00:12:14.359,00:12:16.944,talking about how horrible his boss was– his.
00:12:17.028,00:12:20.698,"And then you pull up. So– Anyway, I’m glad I ran into you."
00:12:20.782,00:12:22.741,I’m getting worried they’re gonna move up our court date.
00:12:25.161,00:12:28.664,"’Cause if they call us on Monday– Uh, you need to get that?"
00:12:28.748,00:12:31.500,No. It’s fine. It’s just a...
00:12:31.584,00:12:33.502,picture of my daughter standing for the first time.
00:12:33.586,00:12:37.006,"Yeah, they do that. It’s a big day. Anyway, I need you here tomorrow."
00:12:37.090,00:12:40.927,"I know it’s a Sunday, but, uh, you think you can be on time, okay?"
00:12:42.345,00:12:47.850,"Actually, um, I have plans tomorrow, uh, so I won’t be here."
00:12:47.934,00:12:53.898,I-I have plans to stay at home with my family and do absolutely nothing. Okay.
00:12:53.982,00:12:56.358,But I will see you on Monday.
00:12:56.442,00:12:58.444,"So, you’re in charge now, is that it?"
00:12:58.528,00:13:01.488,"Well, I just figure if my daughter can stand up, then so can I."
00:13:01.572,00:13:06.160,"All right, look. We’ve all been working hard lately, okay?"
00:13:06.244,00:13:10.206,But that’s the job. So either come in tomorrow or don’t bother coming back again.
00:13:13.042,00:13:14.544,Okay.
00:13:19.007,00:13:21.300,Hmm.
00:13:25.847,00:13:28.349,"Need the, uh, I.D. to– Uh-huh."
00:13:28.433,00:13:30.393,make the elevator go down to freedom...
00:13:31.602,00:13:33.730,and this to complete my set.
00:13:38.276,00:13:42.446,"Turtle, reptile, pet."
00:13:48.578,00:13:50.537,Maybe we should just get to the cold cuts.
00:13:50.621,00:13:52.539,"Well, we wanna hear it."
00:13:52.623,00:13:58.087,"Jay, why don’t you read it? You were with him at the end. Remember?"
00:14:08.431,00:14:12.351,"When I didn’t get a date with Fiona Gunderson, Shel was there."
00:14:12.435,00:14:16.021,"When I didn’t get to play the part of Tevye, Shel was there."
00:14:16.105,00:14:20.567,"And when a raccoon broke into my room, unfortunately, Shel was there."
00:14:20.651,00:14:26.115,"I said a lot of things to my friend, but the one thing I never got to say was good-bye."
00:14:26.199,00:14:28.701,Stop. I know what really happened.
00:14:28.785,00:14:31.120,- You do? - I left a bag of chips near my bed.
00:14:31.204,00:14:35.541,The raccoon must have smelled it. It’s my fault he’s dead.
00:14:38.127,00:14:41.380,"Jay, you don’t have anything to say to Manny?"
00:14:45.843,00:14:47.804,Manny.
00:14:52.308,00:14:54.226,Shel forgives you.
00:14:54.310,00:14:56.270,Thank you.
00:15:03.486,00:15:06.071,"Wow. Sweetie, that perm."
00:15:06.155,00:15:08.323,"Technically, that’s a Jheri curl."
00:15:08.407,00:15:11.618,I just love to take pictures. I took this one of myself today.
00:15:14.664,00:15:17.291,You know what? I’m gonna open a bottle of wine.
00:15:17.375,00:15:19.710,No. No. That’s the worst idea.
00:15:19.794,00:15:22.296,"No, no. I’m not in the mood."
00:15:22.380,00:15:24.423,"What am I, raised by a pack of wolves?"
00:15:24.507,00:15:26.175,Hey. Come on now.
00:15:26.259,00:15:28.260,Honey.
00:15:28.344,00:15:30.512,You weren’t completely wrong about Denise.
00:15:30.596,00:15:32.139,- How’s that? - She wants me.
00:15:32.223,00:15:35.267,- To do what? - It. Her.
00:15:35.351,00:15:38.604,"Oh. Oh, this is because of the thing I said about Facebook..."
00:15:38.688,00:15:40.856,"and everybody’s hooking up, and now you’re disappointed."
00:15:40.940,00:15:44.443,No. She bit the air right in front of me. Like that.
00:15:44.527,00:15:46.487,And then look what she tried to give me.
00:15:46.571,00:15:48.489,No.
00:15:48.573,00:15:52.284,I can’t find my corkscrew.
00:15:52.368,00:15:56.288,"Okay. Denise, somewhere along the line you got the wrong idea."
00:15:56.372,00:15:58.207,My head is full of wrong ideas.
00:16:05.214,00:16:07.132,Let me get a little of this.
00:16:07.216,00:16:09.343,"Phil, would you mind grabbing us a couple glasses?"
00:16:09.427,00:16:11.553,Need me to grab anything?
00:16:11.637,00:16:14.223,"- Okay, this is so wrong. - I know."
00:16:14.307,00:16:16.475,"It’s way more exciting when she’s in the room, isn’t it?"
00:16:19.312,00:16:22.189,But this still can’t happen. When did that break?
00:16:22.273,00:16:25.484,- Why are you wussing out? - I never wussed in.
00:16:25.568,00:16:27.528,What about all those things you wrote on Facebook?
00:16:32.992,00:16:36.245,Are you telling me that I wasted a year of my life on this relationship?
00:16:36.329,00:16:39.039,- What relationship? - How many other women have you led on?
00:16:44.587,00:16:47.840,"Phil, honey."
00:16:51.093,00:16:53.011,"Yeah, uh, when I slipped on the ice."
00:17:00.436,00:17:03.438,- So you were still dating her when you started dating me? - No.
00:17:07.318,00:17:09.319,"when, uh, I was trying to break things off with Denise."
00:17:09.403,00:17:11.363,Uh-huh.
00:17:15.117,00:17:17.703,"Okay, I know the pain is fresh, but the lie is really old."
00:17:17.787,00:17:21.540,"You know, this was a mistake. I’m gonna leave."
00:17:21.624,00:17:24.376,"Claire, if I were you, I would kick him out."
00:17:24.460,00:17:27.880,Maybe he’d appreciate you more after he spent a lonely night in a hotel.
00:17:27.964,00:17:30.257,"At the Radisson, by the airport."
00:17:32.843,00:17:35.220,You quit?
00:17:35.304,00:17:36.930,"No, no. This is the new me, Cam."
00:17:37.014,00:17:39.641,I am not letting people run my life anymore.
00:17:39.725,00:17:42.227,"I should be nervous, but I’m not. I’m excited for you."
00:17:42.311,00:17:44.563,Yes! It’s exciting! It’s exciting.
00:17:52.822,00:17:55.574,- Hey. - And I’m not picking it up.
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.248,But isn’t it worth it if you feel like you’re living your life for the first time?
00:18:03.332,00:18:05.250,Totally.
00:18:05.334,00:18:09.838,"You will go back to teaching music, and then I’ll just find something in a... few months."
00:18:09.922,00:18:12.424,"And until then, all we need to do is just sit back..."
00:18:12.508,00:18:15.510,and watch this little miracle here dazzle us.
00:18:15.594,00:18:18.013,I’m tingling.
00:18:21.183,00:18:24.061,"Oh, God, it’s really pounding."
00:18:24.145,00:18:29.691,"It’s like I feel the weight of endless possibilities just sitting on my chest– - She is not doing anything, Cam. - You’re not panicking, are you?"
00:18:36.324,00:18:38.909,What are we gonna do?
00:18:38.993,00:18:42.329,This is what we’re gonna do. I am going to– I’m gonna do what I’m trained to do.
00:18:42.413,00:18:45.082,"I am going to lie, grovel, debase myself until I get what I want."
00:18:45.166,00:18:46.625,"I am a lawyer, damn it."
00:18:50.379,00:18:51.880,"Oh, no, you’re right. The tie."
00:18:51.964,00:18:56.009,"No. We’ll find something better for you, something that works for all of us."
00:18:58.387,00:19:02.557,We have a mortgage. We have– We have a child to support.
00:19:02.641,00:19:04.685,"Hey, it’s gonna be okay."
00:19:04.769,00:19:06.853,We’re gonna figure it out.
00:19:06.937,00:19:09.648,"I just want you to be happy, and you will be happy."
00:19:10.649,00:19:13.277,And that is something worth toasting.
00:19:15.571,00:19:18.407,"Let’s just drink the cheap stuff, ’cause we might have to sell that bottle."
00:19:25.164,00:19:28.500,"Isn’t it, Jay?"
00:19:28.584,00:19:30.711,He’s probably sleeping like a baby right now.
00:19:30.795,00:19:33.922,"I’m sure he’s wide awake, full of guilt."
00:19:45.434,00:19:47.395,Damn it!
00:19:51.899,00:19:53.859,"Hello, Jay."
00:19:54.944,00:19:56.862,- What are you doing up? - Waiting.
00:19:56.946,00:20:01.033,"- Waiting for what? - The truth. It wasn’t a raccoon, was it?"
00:20:01.117,00:20:04.202,"Oh, all right. You got me. I killed Shel."
00:20:04.286,00:20:06.580,All right? I’m sorry. It was an accident.
00:20:06.664,00:20:10.459,- Why didn’t you just tell me? - Because I didn’t want you to be upset with me.
00:20:10.543,00:20:13.045,You and I got off to a rocky start.
00:20:13.129,00:20:14.963,"Lately, it’s been pretty good."
00:20:15.047,00:20:18.759,I was afraid I’d mess all that up if you knew that I was the one that killed your pet.
00:20:18.843,00:20:21.636,Now you’re the guy who killed my pet and made a stupid lie about it.
00:20:21.720,00:20:24.932,"Well, I don’t think it was stupid. I thought it was pretty clever."
00:20:26.142,00:20:28.226,I was just trying to avoid past mistakes.
00:20:28.310,00:20:30.604,Look.
00:20:34.817,00:20:37.194,Maybe.
00:20:39.029,00:20:43.450,"Since we’re confessing things, you know that scratch on your car?"
00:20:43.534,00:20:45.327,The one that can’t be buffed out? Yeah?
00:20:45.411,00:20:48.414,- You should probably know how it happened. - I know how it happened.
00:20:49.665,00:20:51.584,Raccoon did it.
00:20:53.335,00:20:55.337,"Good night, Jay."
00:20:58.424,00:21:01.676,Best thing I ever did was quit a miserable job and start my own business.
00:21:01.760,00:21:03.970,"- Thanks, Dad. - No, it’s not gonna be easy."
00:21:04.054,00:21:07.474,That’s why Gloria and I wanna give you a little something to help you through it.
00:21:07.558,00:21:10.811,"- No, Dad, I can’t. - No. I want to, Mitch."
00:21:10.895,00:21:20.529,"Okay, but as soon as I’m back on my feet, I really want to– Oh. Oh, Dad. No. You– You tried to give me this 20 years ago when my pet snake died."
00:21:20.613,00:21:22.364,I did?
00:21:22.448,00:21:25.158,Zsa Zsa Gaboa?
00:21:25.242,00:21:27.702,And you really didn’t know that he was gay?
00:21:27.786,00:21:29.788,"I must’ve, right?"
00:00:04.087,00:00:08.383,Throw on my wireless headphones and disappear into the Nature Channel.
00:00:16.767,00:00:21.855,"is how, in the blink of an eye, it can go from a scene of total tranquil beauty..."
00:00:27.194,00:00:33.158,"It’s noise-canceling technology. Give it a spin. It’s got– - Sweetie, focus, now. - Mom, why are you freaking out on everyone?"
00:00:33.242,00:00:36.369,Because you are acting very irresponsibly– all of you.
00:00:44.962,00:00:48.965,I’d like to point out I completed all my assignments on my own and on time.
00:00:51.301,00:00:54.596,I will take the cupcakes. You do the project. It’s on Vincent van Gogh.
00:00:54.680,00:00:57.473,Done! I need you to really stay on him. Keep him focused.
00:01:02.646,00:01:05.064,"Claire, I know you’ve got your methods, but so do I."
00:01:05.148,00:01:07.442,"And I’m sorry, but I’m not a micromanager."
00:01:07.526,00:01:11.571,"Trust me, I can provide Luke with the tools and guidance he needs..."
00:01:11.655,00:01:14.115,"without, uh, smothering him."
00:01:14.199,00:01:17.076,You think I smother our child?
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.497,You never hear of anyone being sfathered to death.
00:01:21.581,00:01:25.084,I know what Luke’s problem is. He’s got A.D.H.D.
00:01:25.168,00:01:27.086,"No, I don’t!"
00:01:27.170,00:01:31.507,What is it?
00:01:31.591,00:01:34.802,Just promise me that you will stay on him until this project is done.
00:01:34.886,00:01:37.722,"I will, but you might have a little more confidence in him."
00:01:42.686,00:01:45.271,Whoo!
00:01:45.355,00:01:48.149,Everybody is stupid except me.
00:01:48.233,00:01:51.111,"Ha, ha, ha. I am funny."
00:02:04.082,00:02:06.960,Is this the cutest thing I’ve ever seen?
00:02:07.044,00:02:10.505,"You out here on the curb with your little telescope, waiting for your dad."
00:02:10.589,00:02:12.298,It’s not cute. It’s-It’s science.
00:02:12.382,00:02:15.802,Tonight is the magnificent Lyrid meteor shower.
00:02:20.223,00:02:23.851,"Every couple years, Mitchell and his father go out and enjoy one of these showers together."
00:02:23.935,00:02:26.437,"Oh, I– I wouldn’t necessarily put it that way."
00:02:26.521,00:02:30.775,"I mean, yes, me and my father enjoy it, because we don’t share a lot of the same interests."
00:02:34.738,00:02:37.240,Probably because you call ’em sports games.
00:02:38.367,00:02:41.869,Just lose the sports.
00:02:47.751,00:02:50.336,Don’t worry about me.
00:02:50.420,00:02:53.298,"I’m just saying, if you were."
00:03:09.981,00:03:13.192,"Cameron, are you okay? You seem nervous."
00:03:13.276,00:03:15.612,"Uh, nervous? No. I’m not nervous."
00:03:17.989,00:03:19.741,I was nervous.
00:03:19.825,00:03:24.037,"I mean, when Mitchell made plans with his father, I figured, why not spend the evening with Gloria?"
00:03:24.121,00:03:26.414,I’ve always wanted to be good friends with her.
00:03:26.498,00:03:28.166,"On paper, we should be good friends."
00:03:28.250,00:03:33.087,"Look at us. One spicy, curvy diva– And Gloria."
00:03:33.171,00:03:36.257,"The problem is, I had a little minor setback that we had to overcome..."
00:03:36.341,00:03:38.051,from a couple weeks ago.
00:03:38.135,00:03:40.386,I cannot stand hanging out with his Ivy League friends.
00:03:40.470,00:03:41.971,"Oh, they’re the worst."
00:03:42.055,00:03:43.556,They are the worst!
00:03:52.566,00:03:54.442,and take her weird little Brown friend with her.
00:04:04.661,00:04:06.621,Not very well.
00:04:06.705,00:04:09.457,You know how awkward I get when things get awkward.
00:04:13.753,00:04:17.006,I was talking about people who go to a university.
00:04:34.399,00:04:36.317,Where are we going?
00:04:36.401,00:04:38.569,Make sure your seat belt is securely fastened...
00:04:38.653,00:04:40.780,and your tray tables are in the upright position...
00:04:40.864,00:04:43.116,because I got us into Palaiseau!
00:04:43.200,00:04:45.118,Ah! Fancy!
00:04:45.202,00:04:50.415,"It’s normally a four-week wait, but the maître d’ is an old Pilates brother of mine, so just one phone call."
00:04:52.292,00:04:55.795,Palaiseau!
00:05:00.383,00:05:03.553,"Can we just go somewhere, like, more simple?"
00:05:03.637,00:05:06.013,"Oh, uh, yes. Yes, of course."
00:05:06.097,00:05:09.518,We can– What were– What did you have in mind?
00:05:12.562,00:05:15.690,How ’bout a little Latin place that I always used to go?
00:05:15.774,00:05:17.692,That sounds fantastic.
00:05:17.776,00:05:19.819,I would love to see how your people eat.
00:05:19.903,00:05:22.113,Your people?
00:05:30.413,00:05:32.999,Okay. Okay.
00:05:33.083,00:05:36.836,My mom’s not dumb. You can’t just ask her to do something for you.
00:05:36.920,00:05:40.924,You have to very carefully put the cheese in the trap.
00:05:43.593,00:05:45.553,Oh. Oops. I got a little shell in the bowl.
00:05:45.637,00:05:49.682,"- When that happens, I find that I like to... not do that. - I got it. It’s okay."
00:05:53.186,00:05:55.354,You just mop up.
00:05:55.438,00:05:57.398,And snap.
00:05:59.693,00:06:03.112,So how do I start?
00:06:03.196,00:06:05.865,I don’t know. Mom usually tells me what to do.
00:06:09.286,00:06:12.914,We are going to try a new approach this time.
00:06:12.998,00:06:16.584,"Now, your goal is to create a display about the life and art of van Gogh, right?"
00:06:16.668,00:06:20.213,Yeah.
00:06:20.297,00:06:24.258,"So, pretend you’re telling the story of his life..."
00:06:24.342,00:06:26.344,to someone who has never heard of him.
00:06:26.428,00:06:29.764,What do you put on that board?
00:06:29.848,00:06:35.811,I see the wheels spinning. A spark of crea– How do they get the lead in pencils?
00:06:41.484,00:06:44.237,I take it from your mocking tone that I am incorrect.
00:06:44.321,00:06:46.197,Densest planet is Earth.
00:06:46.281,00:06:49.075,Which makes you the densest guy on the densest planet.
00:06:49.159,00:06:51.410,Zing!
00:06:51.494,00:06:53.829,earlier that day You sure Mitchell won’t mind me tagging along?
00:06:57.000,00:07:00.586,I’ve never had a brother before. We never really hung out that much.
00:07:00.670,00:07:02.755,"Kiddo, you are overthinking this."
00:07:02.839,00:07:04.882,I just don’t wanna say the wrong thing.
00:07:04.966,00:07:07.260,You can’t. That’s the beauty of having a brother.
00:07:07.344,00:07:09.679,Me and my brother were zinging each other all the time.
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.309,"You know, things of that nature."
00:07:15.393,00:07:18.187,It’s– It’s how brothers express love.
00:07:18.271,00:07:20.190,Hmm.
00:07:28.281,00:07:30.992,I’m gonna see the sights.
00:07:34.704,00:07:37.207,"Kind of missed with that one, kid."
00:07:38.375,00:07:40.251,All right.
00:07:43.505,00:07:46.549,"Apparently, the pencil’s in two pieces, and they glue ’em together on the lead."
00:07:46.633,00:07:49.468,What if we put all the stuff about his life on this side...
00:07:49.552,00:07:52.054,and all the stuff about his paintings on this side?
00:07:52.138,00:07:54.015,"Luke, buddy, that’s fantastic!"
00:07:54.099,00:07:56.309,"And the best part is, you came up with that by yourself."
00:08:04.734,00:08:07.987,"But you run with this. On your mark, get set, van Gogh."
00:08:08.071,00:08:09.989,"Hey, Dad."
00:08:10.073,00:08:13.242,"He kind of looks like Uncle Mitchell, if Uncle Mitchell were insane."
00:08:18.581,00:08:21.584,"Oh, you stink!"
00:08:21.668,00:08:24.045,And not just at astronomy! Blammo!
00:08:24.129,00:08:26.089,What is happening?
00:08:32.470,00:08:34.388,I love this place.
00:08:34.472,00:08:40.019,I was a little bit worried because it’s not exactly– I... love... this place.
00:08:40.103,00:08:42.271,I... was... nervous.
00:08:42.355,00:08:47.026,"I mean, there was a lot of different food on the menu, and on the floor, and on the wall."
00:08:49.821,00:08:51.489,"Were you there, Mitchell?"
00:08:51.573,00:08:54.825,Because I think I would have recognized the only other white or gay person.
00:08:54.909,00:08:58.537,I’d already offended Gloria once. Not gonna do it again.
00:08:58.621,00:09:01.123,Hola. ¿Cómo está? ¡Gloria!
00:09:01.207,00:09:03.209,¿Cómo estás?
00:09:05.295,00:09:07.880,"So, carnitas diablos."
00:09:07.964,00:09:11.050,"- Claro. - Um, I’ll just have the same thing."
00:09:11.134,00:09:13.719,"No, no, no. You should have the chicken enchiladas."
00:09:13.803,00:09:16.806,"Mm-hmm. No, I’ll have the carnitas diablos."
00:09:16.890,00:09:18.933,- These are not for you. - Excuse me?
00:09:19.017,00:09:22.144,"- They’re too spicy. Miss Gloria’s used to it. - Yeah, he’s right."
00:09:22.228,00:09:26.399,"I can spice you under the table any day there, sweet thing."
00:09:26.483,00:09:29.902,"Dos carnitas diablos, por favor."
00:09:29.986,00:09:31.612,Okay.
00:09:31.696,00:09:33.572,Okay.
00:09:35.825,00:09:39.412,- Mitchell! - Of course. What was I thinking?
00:09:46.336,00:09:48.713,"Hey, Jay, is that Venus?"
00:09:48.797,00:09:51.590,’Cause I can smell the clouds of pure sulfuric acid from here.
00:09:51.674,00:09:55.136,- Slam! - Okay. I-I’d really like to go home now.
00:09:55.220,00:09:57.888,We’ll miss the meteor shower.
00:09:57.972,00:10:00.975,Just take them off. I think there’s a blanket in the trunk.
00:10:01.059,00:10:03.352,"You sure, Dad? You’re not worried I might stink up the blanket?"
00:10:03.436,00:10:05.354,Don’t worry about it.
00:10:05.438,00:10:09.108,We just use it to cover up the seat for when Manny’s all sweaty after his tango class.
00:10:09.192,00:10:11.778,"If you don’t sweat, you’re not doing it right."
00:10:17.951,00:10:20.661,He was one of the best boyfriends I ever had.
00:10:20.745,00:10:23.247,But he was gay.
00:10:23.331,00:10:27.835,I figured that out after the first month– and I stayed for a whole year because the haircuts were fantastic!
00:10:27.919,00:10:30.921,"It’s funny, huh?"
00:10:31.005,00:10:33.674,"Cameron, that one is not that funny."
00:10:33.758,00:10:35.217,Are you okay?
00:10:35.301,00:10:37.595,Are you sure?
00:10:37.679,00:10:40.347,But your head is running water.
00:10:40.431,00:10:42.224,"No, I don’t think it is."
00:10:45.562,00:10:48.063,I just need to get a bit of a drink of something.
00:10:48.147,00:10:51.067,"Cameron, the water makes it so worse. No!"
00:10:52.402,00:10:54.653,"Oh, you’re right. That does make it worse."
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.989,Oh– I feel like I ate the sun!
00:10:57.073,00:11:02.036,And that is the secret to no lumps. See? It’s kind of fun.
00:11:02.120,00:11:03.996,"- You make it fun, Mom. - Mmm."
00:11:06.958,00:11:10.545,Alex!
00:11:20.263,00:11:24.559,Often impulsively abandons one task for another.
00:11:30.565,00:11:32.525,That’s where I left those.
00:11:32.609,00:11:39.198,"A tendency to act without regard to consequences, often at the expense of personal safety."
00:11:56.549,00:12:00.470,"-Having accidents more often– -I think that’s enough, Alex. We’ve got it."
00:12:15.318,00:12:18.320,"Oh, no. No!"
00:12:22.158,00:12:24.493,"Phil. Phil! Honey, are you okay?"
00:12:33.586,00:12:38.591,"For your information, your son is hard at work on an awesome van Gogh– Gotta fix that– masterpiece."
00:12:38.675,00:12:40.926,Wait’ll you see. You’re gonna be so surprised.
00:12:41.010,00:12:44.722,"Oh, God, honey. I want nothing more than to be surprised, really."
00:12:47.725,00:12:50.019,Oh.
00:12:50.103,00:12:52.105,I’m not surprised.
00:12:54.399,00:12:57.860,"Okay, that’s it. I don’t want to hear anything about your new method of doing things."
00:12:57.944,00:13:05.660,"There’s one thing that works with these kids, and that is staying on top of them, which, thanks to you, my friend, I will now be able to do all night long."
00:13:13.292,00:13:16.378,"- Not happy, dude. You’re supposed to be working. - I am working."
00:13:16.462,00:13:25.221,"- Mr. Potato Head, really? - I know what you think, but– No, I don’t wanna hear it. I’m going down to clean up the garage, then I’m coming back and I’m gonna stand over you until this thing is done, okay?"
00:13:32.562,00:13:34.563,Breathe.
00:13:34.647,00:13:36.315,Okay. Then drink this milk.
00:13:36.399,00:13:40.277,"Ay, Cam. Why did you have to order that spicy dish?"
00:13:40.361,00:13:42.488,"Because I’m, um, a big idiot..."
00:13:42.572,00:13:46.283,and I wanted to have this awesome night between the two of us...
00:13:46.367,00:13:50.913,"where we end up best friends, uh, having lunch, buying shoes."
00:13:50.997,00:13:55.042,"Okay! Let’s go have lunch, let’s go buy shoes."
00:13:55.126,00:13:58.003,Really?
00:13:58.087,00:14:02.132,"Well, I don’t know. I guess I just always feel like I blow it with you..."
00:14:02.216,00:14:04.343,whether it’s the Columbian comment...
00:14:04.427,00:14:06.387,or picking the wrong restaurant.
00:14:06.471,00:14:10.057,The restaurant had nothing to do with you.
00:14:10.141,00:14:13.143,I was just not in the mood to go anywhere that fancy...
00:14:16.439,00:14:18.941,What did you do?
00:14:19.025,00:14:21.986,I bought a dress.
00:14:22.070,00:14:25.030,Ay. It was a very expensive dress that I don’t need.
00:14:25.114,00:14:29.660,"I felt so stupid that when I got home, I couldn’t even bring it inside the house."
00:14:29.744,00:14:31.870,I left it in the car.
00:14:31.954,00:14:33.872,I have a legendary hat story.
00:14:33.956,00:14:36.125,I’ll bet you look fabulous in that dress.
00:14:36.209,00:14:39.378,"Yes, but anyone would look fabulous in that dress."
00:14:43.174,00:14:45.592,This was all I could find. Shut up!
00:14:45.676,00:14:48.387,- Really shows off your shape. - Okay.
00:14:48.471,00:14:50.889,"Spin around, cupcake. Let’s see the caboose!"
00:14:55.144,00:14:57.938,Was that too far?
00:14:58.022,00:15:00.316,I better go mop this up.
00:15:01.317,00:15:12.411,"Oh, come on. Where’s the– I’m sorry if things got a little out of hand back there, but in our defense, look at you."
00:15:16.707,00:15:19.961,"Oh, don’t be too hard on the kid. I was egging him on."
00:15:21.337,00:15:24.465,"You’re gonna be mad, be mad at me."
00:15:24.549,00:15:27.009,I was just happy to see him laugh a little bit.
00:15:27.093,00:15:29.094,"You know, he’s had kind of a tough week."
00:15:29.178,00:15:33.432,"I got sprayed by a skunk, and I’m wearing a dress that makes my hips look huge."
00:15:33.516,00:15:39.188,"I know he doesn’t want me to talk about it, but he didn’t get invited to this big party."
00:15:39.272,00:15:42.275,Some kids he thought were his friends think he’s weird.
00:15:43.943,00:15:46.612,"Now, you know me on this. I’m no– I’m no good at it."
00:15:46.696,00:15:49.990,"You know, I– I never know what to say."
00:15:50.074,00:15:53.369,But maybe I raised a kid who would know what to say.
00:15:55.204,00:16:00.709,"That’s the only reason I invited him along– you know, because this astronomy stuff, that’s– that’s our thing."
00:16:04.005,00:16:05.923,"Yeah. No, I’ll talk to him."
00:16:06.007,00:16:08.175,"You know, you don’t look that ridiculous."
00:16:10.553,00:16:13.138,"No, I’m just saying, if you were that type of a gay– Dad!"
00:16:24.066,00:16:26.985,"No, it’s not safe at all."
00:16:30.072,00:16:32.866,"Yeah, that’s why I come down here. Look there."
00:16:32.950,00:16:34.827,That was my old apartment.
00:16:34.911,00:16:37.788,"After I left Javier, that’s all I could afford."
00:16:39.874,00:16:43.585,"You have to remember those things, like you when you go to your farm."
00:16:43.669,00:16:45.921,You remember that? I told you that a year ago.
00:16:46.005,00:16:49.466,"Of course I do. You’re my friend, you big idiot."
00:16:53.429,00:16:56.265,"but the people here, Cameron– the best."
00:16:58.142,00:17:00.394,I’m pretty sure I had wheels when I parked here.
00:17:00.478,00:17:02.479,¡Ayayay! Who did this?
00:17:02.563,00:17:05.482,"No, it’s okay, Gloria."
00:17:09.445,00:17:14.199,"What? What? You scared? You scared to show your face, little girl?"
00:17:14.283,00:17:17.035,"No, it’s all right, everybody!"
00:17:17.119,00:17:19.204,"Gloria, I think it’s drivable."
00:17:19.288,00:17:20.790,Gloria!
00:17:22.750,00:17:26.461,"Just so you know, I’m going back up to Luke’s room, and I’m not leaving until he’s finished."
00:17:26.545,00:17:30.424,Thank you.
00:17:30.508,00:17:32.968,"Well, that means a lot to me."
00:17:33.052,00:17:35.596,"The hardest part is, he kinda takes after me with all this."
00:17:35.680,00:17:38.015,Hmm.
00:17:35.680,00:17:40.101,Like my lack of focus and your– My what?
00:17:45.106,00:17:47.065,I did it.
00:17:47.149,00:17:48.984,"Oh, my God."
00:17:49.068,00:17:52.571,- Do you like it? - I-I– I love it.
00:17:52.655,00:17:54.656,Did you do this?
00:17:54.740,00:17:58.243,I used Mr. Potato Head ears because van Gogh cut his ear off.
00:17:58.327,00:18:04.541,"And there’s money because his paintings sell for, like, a bajillion dollars, which is sad because he died broke."
00:18:04.625,00:18:09.129,Yes. That– Don’t apologize.
00:18:09.213,00:18:12.174,I’m not apologizing.
00:18:12.258,00:18:17.596,"Luke, I-I really couldn’t be more proud of you, and I am so sorry I didn’t give you more credit."
00:18:17.680,00:18:19.640,Thanks.
00:18:27.231,00:18:29.858,"- Sweetie, can you hand me those? - Uh-huh."
00:18:29.942,00:18:32.486,"Yeah, I can talk."
00:18:32.570,00:18:33.946,What are you doing?
00:18:34.030,00:18:37.033,"I showed you how to make ’em, and now you can do it yourself."
00:18:38.534,00:18:40.161,"Come on, guys. Let’s go."
00:18:44.707,00:18:47.626,Okay. I’m setting the oven to 700!
00:18:47.710,00:18:51.296,"I’m putting, uh– I’m putting the eggs in the bowl!"
00:18:51.380,00:18:53.966,"Oh, I got some shells in ’em! Uh-oh!"
00:19:16.906,00:19:19.491,"Yeah, they would, um– they’d call me weird."
00:19:19.575,00:19:22.077,"I was weird. Uh, fun weird."
00:19:22.161,00:19:24.705,But I– This is the funny thing about growing up.
00:19:24.789,00:19:27.207,"For years and years, everybody’s desperately afraid..."
00:19:27.291,00:19:30.210,"to be different, you know, in any way."
00:19:43.349,00:19:45.767,I’m sorry I was picking on you too much.
00:19:43.349,00:19:48.270,"Ah, that’s– Jay said that’s what brothers do."
00:19:48.354,00:19:51.440,"Well, we don’t have to listen to him. Brothers do that too."
00:19:51.524,00:19:54.026,"Okay, ladies. Finish up your tea party."
00:19:54.110,00:19:55.569,You’re missing the show.
00:19:58.489,00:20:01.242,Check it out. Check it out.
00:20:02.243,00:20:04.161,Wow.
00:20:12.420,00:20:27.059,"Maybe because the sky is beautiful, and everybody likes looking at it, and it reminds us that something’s up there watching over all of us– aliens, who could be here in a second..."
00:20:27.143,00:20:29.102,to liquefy us and use us as fuel.
00:20:29.186,00:20:31.772,"So wake up, people. We’re next."
00:20:31.856,00:20:33.774,Mom!
00:20:33.858,00:20:35.818,You better get down here!
00:20:42.908,00:20:45.410,Wow! Delicious!
00:20:48.497,00:20:50.957,"No. You know what, sweetie? You’re gonna be late for school. Just go."
00:20:51.041,00:20:52.959,- I’ll bring ’em by later. - Are you sure?
00:20:53.043,00:20:55.087,"Yeah! Get out of here, Betty Crocker. Okay."
00:20:55.171,00:20:57.089,I’m so proud of you!
00:20:59.175,00:21:01.176,Do we still have the number for Poison Control?
00:21:01.260,00:21:03.553,"I love you, Claire. I’ll always love you!"
00:21:03.637,00:21:05.430,"My mouth is asleep, like at the dentist."
00:21:05.514,00:21:07.516,"Get over here, buddy."
00:02:18.638,00:02:20.140,Let him win.
00:00:02.169,00:00:04.087,Today Sam Riley kicked a soccer ball...
00:00:04.171,00:00:06.756,and it hit another kid so hard his eye popped out.
00:00:06.840,00:00:08.258,Awesome!
00:00:08.342,00:00:10.260,Really? His eye popped out.
00:00:10.344,00:00:12.720,Never mind.
00:00:12.804,00:00:15.348,That’s right. It’s somebody’s birthday.
00:00:23.023,00:00:26.442,What is so great about that doohickey anyhow?
00:00:26.526,00:00:30.155,"It’s a movie theater, a library and a music store..."
00:00:30.239,00:00:32.824,all rolled into one awesome pad.
00:00:38.455,00:00:41.457,I better load the beach chair into the trunk. I’m gonna need it for the line in the morning.
00:00:41.541,00:00:44.919,"Wait, honey. Hang on. You can’t spend your birthday in line."
00:00:45.003,00:00:48.298,"Well, not the whole day. I have to be there at 6:00, or forget about it."
00:00:48.382,00:00:50.550,Then I’m out by 10:00.
00:00:50.634,00:00:52.427,"Claire, you don’t have to do that."
00:00:52.511,00:00:54.470,"No, I know, but I want to."
00:01:00.519,00:01:02.061,Okay.
00:01:07.526,00:01:12.822,"Oh, thank God we didn’t have to hear that stupid story about that place– It was called the Fun Zone. I was 11."
00:01:15.993,00:01:19.829,Then my best friend Jeff Sweeney stepped in and took one in the groin.
00:01:19.913,00:01:24.417,I yelled out Ball two! Everybody laughed.
00:01:24.501,00:01:26.837,That was when I knew I was funny.
00:01:28.547,00:01:30.798,Good night.
00:01:34.886,00:01:37.472,Are you sure there’s not an E-I in the middle?
00:01:39.349,00:01:42.352,"If I can’t fool you, then your teachers can’t fool you either."
00:01:42.436,00:01:44.854,I don’t think they’re trying to fool me.
00:01:44.938,00:01:46.856,Wait until you see what I got Phil for his birthday.
00:01:49.443,00:01:52.362,Ay. It’s not one of those talking alarm clocks?
00:01:52.446,00:01:55.990,It’s 6:05. It’s 6:25. Wake up. Wake up.
00:01:56.074,00:01:58.952,Even better. A rosewood chess set.
00:01:59.036,00:02:01.955,"As matter of fact, before I wrap this thing, what say we take it for a spin?"
00:02:02.039,00:02:05.041,"-Come on, Manny. I’ll teach you. -He knows how to play. His father taught him."
00:02:05.125,00:02:08.044,"I’m gonna teach him real chess, not the Colombian version."
00:02:08.128,00:02:11.547,"We actually use the pieces to play the game, not smuggle stuff out of the country."
00:02:11.631,00:02:14.550,"Uh, I know one Colombian piece you won’t be playing with later."
00:02:14.634,00:02:17.596,"Manny, come on. Let’s see what you got."
00:02:22.059,00:02:25.770,"Manny’s an excellent player, but Jay is a grumpy loser."
00:02:30.734,00:02:33.320,It’s better that he wins.
00:02:39.284,00:02:41.286,"Um, I got this."
00:02:54.758,00:02:57.510,There’s a– There’s a man in Lily’s room.
00:02:57.594,00:02:59.763,There’s a man in Lily’s room!
00:03:02.599,00:03:04.601,It’s go time.
00:03:11.274,00:03:13.068,"Oh, thank God."
00:03:16.446,00:03:19.574,She’s fine. We must have just heard a neighbor with the same monitor.
00:03:19.658,00:03:21.409,Thank God.
00:03:21.493,00:03:25.204,"Boy, if a spider would have broken in here, he would have been in trouble."
00:03:42.097,00:03:43.723,Light-up barbecue tongs.
00:03:50.647,00:03:55.902,"No. No, because I was finally getting my husband something that he really, really wanted."
00:03:55.986,00:03:58.321,I was every bit as excited as he was.
00:04:05.245,00:04:07.664,Uh– No.
00:04:18.008,00:04:21.094,"Hey, buddy. I hope you’re not upset about our chess match yesterday."
00:04:21.178,00:04:23.679,"Hey, what do you say we play again?"
00:04:23.763,00:04:25.807,That’s the spirit.
00:04:25.891,00:04:29.143,Downloaded this for you. It’s kind of a kid’s guide to chess.
00:04:29.227,00:04:31.020,"No, Jay. I’m good."
00:04:31.104,00:04:33.940,"Nah, it’s not all dry like that. They have fun with it."
00:04:34.024,00:04:36.776,"See, you can color in the little players with your crayons."
00:04:36.860,00:04:38.611,Now you are making me want to play again.
00:04:38.695,00:04:41.489,Now we’re lighting a fire. Let me toss this out.
00:04:41.573,00:04:51.541,"If you beat me, if that day should ever come, I’ll give you– - I want your watch. - Wow, you had that loaded up."
00:04:51.625,00:04:53.710,Okay. Game on.
00:04:55.295,00:04:58.089,"Now, I want you to go first."
00:05:01.468,00:05:03.803,I’d have moved that guy two spaces.
00:05:03.887,00:05:06.097,More aggressive.
00:05:06.181,00:05:09.392,And you don’t want to bring your queen out that quickly.
00:05:09.476,00:05:15.357,"See, now you could’ve protected that with that, but now you’re vulnerable– Checkmate."
00:05:16.233,00:05:18.235,How’d you do that?
00:05:20.946,00:05:23.531,You will not believe what’s going on at Jake and Debbie’s house.
00:05:26.576,00:05:28.202,So much drama.
00:05:28.286,00:05:31.080,"Okay, Jake told Debbie that he had to work late."
00:05:34.918,00:05:38.713,So she spent all morning on the phone crying and crying and crying to her mother...
00:05:38.797,00:05:43.468,"and said if Jake has to work late one more time, she’s filing for divorce."
00:05:44.594,00:05:46.053,Huh.
00:05:46.137,00:05:48.931,That’s it? I give you that tasty dish and all you give me is a Huh?
00:05:49.015,00:05:51.350,"I-I’m s– Cam, I froze last night."
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.312,I froze. I thought Lily was in danger and I froze.
00:05:54.396,00:05:56.731,"But not you. No, you sprung right into action."
00:05:56.815,00:05:59.442,You even had the cool It’s go time line.
00:05:59.526,00:06:02.028,That comes to me naturally. I spent a year as a crossing guard.
00:06:02.112,00:06:07.492,"Cam, I mean, what kind of parent am I if I can’t even protect my own family, you know?"
00:06:07.576,00:06:10.495,J-Just once I would love to be the guy with no fear...
00:06:10.579,00:06:13.873,"who can stand up and, I don’t know, you know, kick some ass."
00:06:13.957,00:06:17.544,You’re so cute when you’re angry with your little fists. Just wanna put you in my pocket.
00:06:34.561,00:06:36.312,French waffle cakes.
00:06:36.396,00:06:41.567,Let me guess: one waffle in between two pieces of French toast wrapped in a pancake.
00:06:41.651,00:06:43.402,Nailed it.
00:06:43.486,00:06:45.613,"Bring it in here, monkeys."
00:06:47.991,00:06:49.492,Good enough.
00:06:51.161,00:06:53.162,You mean the greatest woman in the world?
00:06:53.246,00:06:56.958,"She is standing in line at the Apple Store, making all my birthday wishes come true."
00:06:57.042,00:06:58.960,Aww!
00:06:59.044,00:07:00.545,"Oh, no– Son of a– Oh!"
00:07:04.758,00:07:06.425,Do you want some ice?
00:07:11.890,00:07:15.184,"No, it actually– That feels weird. That burns in a different way!"
00:07:15.268,00:07:20.023,Ow! Oh! Don’t wash this until we see if I can get my skin back. Okay?
00:07:24.694,00:07:26.153,Let me see it!
00:07:28.365,00:07:30.658,Just let me see the bag. Did you leave it in the car?
00:07:30.742,00:07:32.285,"Yeah! Hey, who’d you deal with?"
00:07:32.369,00:07:34.662,Was it a guy named Mehar? They call him the beast.
00:07:37.374,00:07:38.833,I kinda love that you’re making me wait.
00:07:41.211,00:07:43.629,You are the best wife ever!
00:07:43.713,00:07:45.798,I didn’t get you the iPad.
00:07:49.552,00:07:51.345,I don’t understand. My online buddies got it.
00:07:51.429,00:07:54.473,SAT800 and Brobot didn’t get there until 8:00.
00:07:57.560,00:08:00.146,"No, no, no! You didn’t get there at 6:30? Where were you?"
00:08:00.230,00:08:03.649,"I set the alarm for 5:00. I got up, I came downstairs, I fell asleep."
00:08:08.154,00:08:11.490,"I should’ve done this myself. Sweetie, you know what? They’re gonna get more in next week."
00:08:15.078,00:08:19.498,Where are you going?
00:08:31.052,00:08:32.637,"Hi, Manny."
00:08:32.721,00:08:36.891,What are you doing here at... 4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?
00:08:36.975,00:08:42.104,"Oh, I’m just returning my dad’s belt of tools, so– At 4:17 on a Saturday afternoon?"
00:08:42.188,00:08:44.607,Don’t you have something better to do?
00:08:46.860,00:08:49.111,"So, were you a big hit?"
00:08:49.195,00:08:52.698,"Well, I just assumed there was some kind of costume party. Was Cam the Indian?"
00:08:56.619,00:08:59.580,Ah. What’d you build?
00:08:59.664,00:09:02.541,And we’re back.
00:09:04.794,00:09:07.713,"Hey, uh, Dad, do you remember when I was, uh, probably 11..."
00:09:13.553,00:09:15.221,Yeah.
00:09:15.305,00:09:18.641,"If I’m ever in a dance fight, I’ll let you know."
00:09:18.725,00:09:22.269,"So, yeah– Is-Is the offer, uh, still good?"
00:09:22.353,00:09:24.397,Why? What’s the matter? You got problems with Cam?
00:09:27.025,00:09:30.152,"Well, come on. I mean, you know, sharing a room with a guy?"
00:09:30.236,00:09:32.738,I bunked with my brother. I know that can get pretty rough.
00:09:32.822,00:09:34.532,I don’t bunk with Cam.
00:09:34.616,00:09:38.160,"Dad, I just wanna learn a little self-defense, you know."
00:09:38.244,00:09:41.163,Right– Right now?
00:09:45.335,00:09:55.094,"And then– That wasn’t– That wasn’t very pretty, was it?"
00:09:59.182,00:10:01.475,Here it goes.
00:10:01.559,00:10:03.144,Oh!
00:10:03.228,00:10:07.148,"Buddy! Think the problem is, you’re not jumping from high enough."
00:10:11.486,00:10:14.530,"Listen, guys, I need your help. We’ve gotta find your dad one of those iPad thingies."
00:10:14.614,00:10:16.782,"So, Haley, text everyone you know."
00:10:16.866,00:10:21.036,"Alex? Facebook, chat, tweet, buzz, bling, I don’t know! Just do what you have to do."
00:10:21.120,00:10:23.539,We have got to find one of these iPads. Okay?
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.506,Stop lying.
00:10:32.549,00:10:34.217,How did she know?
00:10:36.094,00:10:40.848,Didn’t your mama teach you never to take a ride from a stranger?
00:10:40.932,00:10:42.641,Got a little vacation time coming up?
00:10:42.725,00:10:44.685,Have fun on the moon!
00:10:44.769,00:10:46.854,Not feeling too well lately?
00:10:46.938,00:10:49.398,Maybe you should come see the doctor...
00:10:49.482,00:10:51.400,and I’ll get rid of it!
00:10:53.570,00:10:55.238,What’s that supposed to mean?
00:11:00.410,00:11:02.369,they’re gathering in the picnic area.
00:11:02.453,00:11:04.371,Phil’s birthday party.
00:11:08.084,00:11:10.503,Does that really make up for not getting an iPad?
00:11:10.587,00:11:13.756,Don’t make me sorry I shared that with you. Okay?
00:11:13.840,00:11:15.842,"See you, fellas."
00:11:21.431,00:11:24.350,I just heard the announcement for Phil’s birthday party.
00:11:26.436,00:11:28.020,Awesome.
00:11:28.104,00:11:30.397,"Thank you. Thanks, milady."
00:11:35.653,00:11:38.531,Ice cream cake? Ice cream cake’s good.
00:11:41.993,00:11:44.453,Whoa– This is awesome!
00:12:00.345,00:12:02.429,"No, that’s fine, I’m just putting the baby down."
00:12:02.513,00:12:05.057,"Okay, that’s Jake. He’s the one that’s having an affair."
00:12:08.311,00:12:10.062,I’ll just give my wife some excuse.
00:12:12.649,00:12:14.900,"- I don’t really have a choice, do I? - Yeah."
00:12:14.984,00:12:16.652,You could not cheat on her! How about that?
00:12:25.328,00:12:28.247,"- Don’t worry. I’ll just tell her I’m working late. - No, Jake, don’t do that."
00:12:31.501,00:12:35.004,"Oh, no, Lily, what are we gonna do? We have to fix this."
00:12:37.090,00:12:41.218,"Okay, Mitchell, I’m gonna teach you a couple of basic Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves."
00:12:41.302,00:12:43.262,"Now, just– just attack me."
00:12:43.346,00:12:44.972,I’m sorry– What?
00:12:48.518,00:12:50.102,"Dad, I don’t have any deep-seated anger."
00:12:50.186,00:12:52.688,Remember that Halloween when I wouldn’t let you go as Olivia Newton-John?
00:12:55.358,00:12:57.943,You see what I did? I used your momentum against you.
00:12:58.027,00:12:59.528,I learned this choke from the Gracie brothers.
00:12:59.612,00:13:03.073,It’s called the lion killer– mata leão.
00:13:03.157,00:13:06.076,Okay.
00:13:06.160,00:13:11.707,"I can’t. Yeah, all right. Now– Passing out– See, the beauty of this is, you don’t have to make the first move."
00:13:11.791,00:13:14.460,"You know, chances are your opponent’s gonna be overconfident."
00:13:14.544,00:13:16.462,He’s gonna think you don’t know anything.
00:13:16.546,00:13:22.635,"Basically, he’s being suckered into thinking– Manny. Manny, that little bastard, he hustled me."
00:13:23.970,00:13:26.055,"Oh, crap."
00:13:26.139,00:13:28.558,"Ah, crap. Mitchell!"
00:13:29.642,00:13:33.145,"Oh, crap. All right. Come on. Breathe."
00:13:33.229,00:13:35.856,Attaboy. You all right? Coming around.
00:13:35.940,00:13:37.983,Why am I on the floor?
00:13:41.029,00:13:44.490,"Haley, I just struck out again. Please tell me you have some good news."
00:13:44.574,00:13:47.493,"Okay, so The Grove just got a new shipment. I’m texting you the directions now."
00:13:47.577,00:13:51.414,"Oh! Okay, that’s good. That’s good. That’s good."
00:13:52.457,00:13:54.584,I’m there. I’m on that.
00:14:00.256,00:14:01.757,Huh?
00:14:01.841,00:14:03.550,He hustled me at chess.
00:14:06.095,00:14:08.973,- I did the first time. - Wait a minute. You’re in on it too?
00:14:09.057,00:14:12.267,"- Manny, go and get dressed for the party. - Do I have time for a steam?"
00:14:12.351,00:14:14.269,"- Yeah, but a quick one. - Okay."
00:14:14.353,00:14:17.690,Why tell him to lose to me?
00:14:17.774,00:14:19.775,With the kicking and the eyebrows...
00:14:23.112,00:14:24.655,"Actually, that’s not true."
00:14:24.739,00:14:28.075,"I don’t mind losing to a chess genius, which Manny obviously is."
00:14:28.159,00:14:30.536,Chess genius? He’s not even as good as I am.
00:14:30.620,00:14:34.039,You’re not that good in chess. I beat you on our honeymoon. Or did I let you win?
00:14:34.123,00:14:36.542,You didn’t let me win.
00:14:36.626,00:14:40.129,"Why would I sacrifice my queen for your pawn, Jay?"
00:14:40.213,00:14:42.215,Huh? Huh?
00:14:46.177,00:14:48.888,Huh?
00:14:53.893,00:14:56.812,"Luke, honey, hi. What’s going on?"
00:14:56.896,00:15:00.691,"They guy came with Dad’s cake, but just so you know, it’s missing a piece."
00:15:00.775,00:15:03.861,"Luke, did you take a bite out of your father’s cake?"
00:15:03.945,00:15:06.405,"Stop lying, Luke. I’m not lying."
00:15:06.489,00:15:09.742,"By the way, I used your credit card to pay him. Is that all right?"
00:15:12.411,00:15:14.288,That’s why I left the wallet there.
00:15:15.373,00:15:16.874,"Oh, my God."
00:15:18.000,00:15:19.918,"Oh, my God!"
00:15:20.002,00:15:23.547,I left the wallet there! I left the wa– Your poor father.
00:15:23.631,00:15:27.092,"All this running around, and he’s gonna think nobody cares about him on his birthday."
00:15:27.176,00:15:28.927,More cake?
00:15:29.011,00:15:30.888,"Why not, Little Phil?"
00:15:30.972,00:15:32.931,I got no place else to go.
00:15:42.775,00:15:45.944,"Sir! Sir! Sir, hi. Excuse me."
00:15:51.868,00:15:53.577,There is a couple in this neighborhood...
00:15:53.661,00:15:56.038,that is about to get a divorce for a simple misunderstanding.
00:15:56.122,00:15:57.706,Their name is Jake and Debbie.
00:15:57.790,00:15:59.708,And I know you’ve taken an oath...
00:16:12.597,00:16:15.140,Oh.
00:16:15.224,00:16:17.894,This conversation never happened.
00:16:21.230,00:16:22.773,Sorry.
00:16:22.857,00:16:24.650,"Oh, thank you. Thank you."
00:16:24.734,00:16:27.778,Dad just put me to sleep.
00:16:29.572,00:16:32.241,"Oh, my gosh, no. You can’t cut the line. Sorry."
00:16:32.325,00:16:33.992,I was here.
00:16:34.076,00:16:38.288,"I-I’ve been here for an hour and a half and you haven’t been, so you cut the line."
00:16:43.419,00:16:44.879,"Calm down, gingerbread."
00:16:46.088,00:16:48.757,- Are you gonna move or not? - No.
00:16:48.841,00:16:50.759,"Oh, no."
00:16:53.262,00:16:56.682,"Oh, my God."
00:16:56.766,00:16:59.685,Go to sleep. Go to sleep. No.
00:16:59.769,00:17:02.396,"Mitchell, what are you doing? Get off of him."
00:17:02.480,00:17:04.398,He’s about to go to sleep.
00:17:04.482,00:17:06.483,"Okay, folks. Let’s break this up. You three– out of line."
00:17:08.945,00:17:12.156,I’m just waiting in line to get an iPad. I don’t even know this guy.
00:17:12.240,00:17:13.699,"Oh, my God. I need your credit card."
00:17:13.783,00:17:15.576,He’s the problem.
00:17:17.286,00:17:18.704,I’ve got it.
00:17:18.788,00:17:20.873,"I’ve got your card. I’m good. No, I’m good."
00:17:20.957,00:17:22.875,I’m good. I’m here. I’m here!
00:17:22.959,00:17:25.377,I’ve gotta get my husband an iPad!
00:17:25.461,00:17:29.006,Key to a good birthday? Low expectations.
00:17:29.090,00:17:32.259,Thought I was getting an iPad. I was wrong about that.
00:17:37.765,00:17:42.228,"Guess when it comes right down to it, we’re all just Jeff Sweeney taking a fastball to the plums."
00:17:46.440,00:17:51.028,"Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but Uncle Cam’s trying to fix it."
00:17:51.112,00:17:53.030,He won’t.
00:17:53.114,00:17:55.032,And the pizzas never showed up.
00:17:57.118,00:17:59.036,"Hey, balloons."
00:17:59.120,00:18:01.872,Fine. I guess we’ll never know.
00:18:01.956,00:18:03.916,"Yeah, Manny, give me the chess set."
00:18:04.000,00:18:07.085,"-Oh, it’s a chess set. -Yeah. You’ll get it later. We got something to settle now."
00:18:07.169,00:18:09.296,Go in there.
00:18:09.380,00:18:10.756,Happy happy.
00:18:13.551,00:18:15.094,No.
00:18:16.512,00:18:19.348,"Oh, Cam, Cam, you’ll never believe what happened."
00:18:25.730,00:18:28.065,"Well, this is the best day ever. It really is."
00:18:28.149,00:18:30.192,Ain’t it though?
00:18:32.862,00:18:35.697,"Look at this, papi, huh?"
00:18:35.781,00:18:38.033,Easy.
00:18:40.995,00:18:42.663,without your queen.
00:18:42.747,00:18:46.876,"Damn it! Listen, I lose and I burn this house down!"
00:18:49.003,00:18:50.837,"Ah, but look at this– Honey, honey."
00:18:53.716,00:18:58.012,"One of us is gonna win the game, the other’s gonna feel lousy, and we both lose."
00:19:05.519,00:19:09.982,There was no way I could win. I knew it. I’m just glad she didn’t know it yet.
00:19:12.568,00:19:14.319,I’m a very good chess player.
00:19:18.741,00:19:20.659,"Hey, did you get it?"
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.164,"Hey, wife."
00:19:26.248,00:19:28.166,"Um, listen– Mom."
00:19:33.255,00:19:34.881,"But, sweetie, I want you to feel– Mom!"
00:19:34.965,00:19:37.676,"Luke, I’ll be with you in just a second. Where are you going?"
00:19:40.763,00:19:49.938,"- Luke, what do you want? - I went on Dad’s computer, contacted some of his geek friends, told them that he was dying and his last wish was an iPad."
00:19:50.022,00:19:54.985,"Luke, what have I told you about– One of them felt so bad, they brought over an extra."
00:19:55.069,00:19:58.989,"Oh, my God. You got it. You beautiful little liar!"
00:19:59.073,00:20:01.367,Here comes Dad.
00:20:11.293,00:20:15.714,"I used to, but I don’t desire food any– Oh, my God. You got it!"
00:20:15.798,00:20:18.925,"All this time I said I didn’t care, but I do care. I care so much!"
00:20:19.009,00:20:21.303,Do you want to blow out the candles?
00:20:21.387,00:20:23.388,Go on. Go.
00:20:23.472,00:20:25.724,It did not just do that!
00:20:25.808,00:20:28.477,"Yes, it did!"
00:20:28.561,00:20:32.314,"Oh, who’s ready for the first day of the rest of their lives?"
00:20:32.398,00:20:34.608,"Phil, happy birthday! Look at this!"
00:20:34.692,00:20:38.070,Can I touch it?
00:20:38.154,00:20:41.157,"Touch it, but don’t touch it. Touch it, but don’t touch it."
00:20:49.039,00:20:53.001,What did he say his name was? He didn’t. Must be an angel.
00:20:53.085,00:20:54.586,Did you hear that? I’m an angel.
00:20:57.047,00:21:01.468,Wow.
00:21:04.346,00:21:07.391,I’m gonna call the police.
00:21:07.475,00:21:09.684,"No, Cam. Where are you going? It was just getting good."
00:21:09.768,00:21:12.354,I want– That’s my program.
00:21:13.439,00:21:14.940,I love you.
00:21:15.024,00:21:18.068,"I love you too, honey."
00:00:03.003,00:00:04.921,Steaks will be ready in five minutes. You’re destroying those things.
00:00:05.005,00:00:08.174,"Ay, Jay, leave him alone."
00:00:08.258,00:00:10.677,"- Fun. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait."
00:00:12.596,00:00:14.514,Coach wants us to practice layups.
00:00:14.598,00:00:17.600,They are deceptively hard– a curious mix of dance and strength.
00:00:17.684,00:00:20.436,- You’re making it lame again. - Sorry.
00:00:23.815,00:00:25.859,He seems to have the kids motivated.
00:00:25.943,00:00:29.028,"Oh, Dad, you haven’t seen him. He taunts the kids. He’s abusive."
00:00:29.112,00:00:36.244,"Listen, if this was a Colombian soccer league, long time ago, A coach is supposed to ride the kids hard."
00:00:40.958,00:00:43.084,"This guy’s a real motherscratcher. Pardon the language, Gloria."
00:00:43.168,00:00:44.961,- Mm-hmm. - Gloria?
00:00:45.045,00:00:48.548,"He better cool it, or I’m gonna introduce him to the Captain and Tennille."
00:00:50.175,00:00:52.135,Sorry we’re late. I was at work.
00:00:52.219,00:00:54.679,"Oh, he loves to say that."
00:00:56.890,00:01:01.436,"I’ve taken a part-time job at a greeting card store, which I love."
00:01:01.520,00:01:04.273,"Plus, with my discount, we’re saving a fortune."
00:01:15.659,00:01:18.161,2.95. 2.95. 4.95.
00:01:18.245,00:01:19.662,Forty percent off.
00:01:19.746,00:01:21.289,3.95.
00:01:26.670,00:01:32.300,"Oh, thanks, Dad, but I’m– I’m not really looking for anything right now. But– Yeah, that’s right."
00:01:32.384,00:01:34.761,"With me bringing home the bacon, Mitchell doesn’t have to rush into anything."
00:01:34.845,00:01:39.098,"Yeah, I know you have all that greeting card screw you money, but, uh, talk to the guy?"
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.808,He’s expecting your call in the morning.
00:01:43.520,00:01:47.273,"I am sorry, but I– No. Those steaks have been done for five minutes."
00:01:47.357,00:01:48.859,I’m taking ’em off the grill.
00:01:50.652,00:01:54.447,I’m sorry. I know how it feels to have him stick his nose where it doesn’t belong.
00:01:54.531,00:01:56.449,No biggie. It’s just Jay being Jay.
00:01:56.533,00:02:00.537,"But one day I’m gonna be a grandfather, and then everybody better hide their meat."
00:02:18.430,00:02:20.390,I hate it when you do that.
00:02:20.474,00:02:22.308,It’s Charlie Bingham.
00:02:22.392,00:02:25.603,He’s the guy that my dad wanted me to call. I googled him. Look.
00:02:25.687,00:02:28.523,"Oh, he owns Earthgear Apparel. I have their ski pants."
00:02:28.607,00:02:30.316,Really? You don’t– You don’t ski.
00:02:30.400,00:02:33.361,I have cargo pants and I don’t work at the docks.
00:02:33.445,00:02:37.198,"God, I feel like such a slacker. I mean, he has done so much for being so young."
00:02:41.036,00:02:43.746,Wow.
00:02:43.830,00:02:47.792,"I don’t know. I mean, you know, I sort of promised myself and you..."
00:02:47.876,00:02:53.048,"that I’d take a little time off, and– And you are loving your time off."
00:02:54.091,00:02:56.634,I am losing my mind.
00:02:56.718,00:03:04.892,"As much as I love Lily– which is, you know, more than life itself– I am– whoo– not cut out to be a stay-at-home dad."
00:03:04.976,00:03:08.396,"No, but it’s Cameron’s turn. It’s Cameron’s turn to be out in the world..."
00:03:10.982,00:03:13.777,and-and plot the death of Dora the Explorer.
00:03:22.786,00:03:25.705,I don’t know. Maybe just to get your dad off your back. Yeah. Yeah.
00:03:28.917,00:03:31.753,Mmm.
00:03:31.837,00:03:34.213,I am in a really dark space.
00:03:34.297,00:03:37.008,Being away from my Lily is literally torture.
00:03:39.136,00:03:42.055,"but I really, really, really just want him to get a job..."
00:03:42.139,00:03:46.309,so I can go back to being a stay-at-home dad/trophy wife!
00:03:54.526,00:03:57.278,Come on! Could you run any slower?
00:03:57.362,00:03:59.280,I dare you to run slower!
00:03:59.364,00:04:01.282,You see?
00:04:01.366,00:04:03.409,"Oh, I’ll light him on fire!"
00:04:03.493,00:04:05.745,Why do I always have to come to these things?
00:04:07.998,00:04:10.083,Why don’t you make him come to my orchestra concerts?
00:04:10.167,00:04:12.585,"Because we love your brother. Good job, Luke."
00:04:17.507,00:04:19.592,"Delgado, you’re killing me, man!"
00:04:19.676,00:04:22.471,"I love you, Manny, no matter what!"
00:04:28.101,00:04:30.561,"Okay, well, I’ll let you know. Right."
00:04:39.029,00:04:42.365,"I said I’d check with you. I mean, what do you think?"
00:04:50.373,00:04:51.874,- Okay. - Cool.
00:05:00.509,00:05:10.893,I just– I just miss... my grilled cheese sandwiches!
00:05:10.977,00:05:14.063,"You’re doing great, Luke– if your goal is to suck!"
00:05:14.147,00:05:15.314,"Phil, you– I’m on it."
00:05:15.398,00:05:16.357,Okay.
00:05:23.657,00:05:25.324,"I got this. Come on, stupid!"
00:05:29.246,00:05:30.663,Who are you?
00:05:39.089,00:05:42.216,is a little more coaching and a little less yelling.
00:05:47.764,00:05:50.391,Screw it. I don’t need this.
00:05:50.475,00:05:53.687,You think you can do a better job? You coach.
00:05:55.647,00:05:57.356,"Jay, you know, I was handling it."
00:05:59.526,00:06:09.285,"It’s the Captain and– Okay. So, your old coach had to leave for a little while."
00:06:09.369,00:06:11.287,Why? Is he sick?
00:06:11.371,00:06:13.915,"- Yes. He’s very, very sick. - Is he going to die?"
00:06:13.999,00:06:16.209,"Everybody dies, boys. Let’s focus on what’s important."
00:06:16.293,00:06:21.339,Our next game is in one hour. We are going to go from being five fingers to being a fist.
00:06:21.423,00:06:23.341,How does that sound?
00:06:23.425,00:06:25.343,I can’t hear you.
00:06:27.095,00:06:29.055,"All right, gentlemen. I talked to the referee. I’m coaching."
00:06:29.139,00:06:32.475,"Oh, really? ’Cause I– Phil, I coached football."
00:06:37.647,00:06:39.649,Now you think you can round us up some waters?
00:06:41.318,00:06:43.444,- Yeah. - Go ahead.
00:06:43.528,00:06:47.782,"Gentlemen, this is what I need. I want you to hit ’em, and I want you to hit ’em hard."
00:06:49.868,00:06:51.452,because you can’t let ’em push you around...
00:06:51.536,00:06:53.246,and you also have to show them respect.
00:06:53.330,00:06:55.248,It’s like walking a tightrope.
00:06:55.332,00:06:57.917,"Which, by the way, I can do, because I went to trapeze school."
00:06:58.001,00:07:00.294,Did Jay? I doubt it.
00:07:00.378,00:07:02.380,"All right, when you back into– Hey."
00:07:02.464,00:07:05.716,"Honey, I’m gonna take off. I’m gonna buy Alex some clothes."
00:07:05.800,00:07:07.718,How come you’re not coaching?
00:07:07.802,00:07:10.513,’Cause your dad coached football.
00:07:10.597,00:07:14.850,I’m sorry. And I am going to make it up to you tonight.
00:07:14.934,00:07:17.728,And I’ll be thinking of your dad while you do. Mmm.
00:07:17.812,00:07:20.273,Disturbing.
00:07:22.150,00:07:23.276,Hey.
00:07:23.360,00:07:26.445,Ay.
00:07:28.698,00:07:31.033,Thank you again for taking care of Lily. I know it’s last-minute.
00:07:38.416,00:07:41.877,Ay. I think she’s getting used to being away from you now that you have the new job.
00:07:49.928,00:07:53.097,We need to talk.
00:07:53.181,00:07:59.187,"Mom, I love you, but your words of encouragement encourage the other kids to make fun of me."
00:08:00.230,00:08:01.731,Ay. Okay.
00:08:01.815,00:08:05.026,I won’t say anything else on the next game. Promise.
00:08:05.110,00:08:07.153,We both know that your Latin blood makes that impossible.
00:08:07.237,00:08:10.740,I think it would be better if you didn’t come to the next game.
00:08:24.629,00:08:26.547,Oh.
00:08:26.631,00:08:29.134,I hate our house.
00:08:30.427,00:08:32.386,What’s– What’s this thing?
00:08:32.470,00:08:34.055,"I don’t know, but it’s fancy."
00:08:34.139,00:08:37.933,Stop– Stop playing with it. Come on. Just– Don’t break it.
00:08:40.019,00:08:41.520,"Hey, Mitchell! Yes."
00:08:41.604,00:08:43.064,Charlie Bingham.
00:08:43.148,00:08:45.399,Hi.
00:08:47.110,00:08:49.862,"So, we just went ahead and parked on that round thingy in the driveway."
00:08:49.946,00:08:51.197,"Is that– That’s fine, right?"
00:08:51.281,00:08:53.240,"It’s a turntable, so you don’t have to back out."
00:08:53.324,00:08:54.909,Oh.
00:08:54.993,00:08:57.703,You have a car turntable and you’re wearing rubber. You’re like Batman.
00:08:57.787,00:08:59.205,I really am.
00:08:59.289,00:09:00.706,Come on in.
00:09:02.751,00:09:05.461,Wow.
00:09:09.883,00:09:12.301,"Um, only for bargains on the Web."
00:09:12.385,00:09:13.636,Hi.
00:09:13.720,00:09:16.055,Hi. That’s Jolie. She’s head of my Europe division.
00:09:16.139,00:09:18.265,She cheats at poker. You do.
00:09:18.349,00:09:22.228,"And that’s my girlfriend, Jenny. She makes a hell of a margarita. Want one?"
00:09:22.312,00:09:24.772,"Absolutely. Oh, not right– Okay."
00:09:30.487,00:09:32.571,I’m kidding. We’re gay.
00:09:32.655,00:09:35.741,"When things are relaxed, I’m great in social situations."
00:09:35.825,00:09:38.202,I would have fit in at the Algonquin Round Table.
00:09:38.286,00:09:41.497,"But when the stakes are high, I get a little tense."
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.916,I’d be the guy that would knock over the round table.
00:09:49.839,00:09:51.757,How long you been on the lam?
00:09:51.841,00:09:54.427,"Honey, you are looking around like the feds are after you."
00:10:01.518,00:10:03.769,"Oh! Oh, you know those girls from school."
00:10:03.853,00:10:05.771,Hey!
00:10:08.525,00:10:10.776,I’ll meet you at the car in an hour.
00:10:10.860,00:10:13.154,"Please, Mom. Please."
00:10:15.198,00:10:17.116,"Hi, Jenna."
00:10:22.455,00:10:25.708,She entered that dreaded phase where my very existence embarrasses her.
00:10:25.792,00:10:28.294,I-I think I can help.
00:10:28.378,00:10:30.796,You’re not your mom.
00:10:30.880,00:10:33.132,Wow. That’s your mom.
00:10:33.216,00:10:36.135,"Oh, I just got chills."
00:10:43.476,00:10:46.228,Yeah. Mayhew versus Propyltech.
00:10:46.312,00:10:49.106,- You are a good lawyer. - I don’t know.
00:10:49.190,00:10:52.193,"If you’d handled my divorce, this house would be twice as big."
00:10:52.277,00:10:55.070,"Oh, he’s better than good. Try winning an argument with him."
00:10:55.154,00:10:57.656,Last night I wanted to have Indian food– And we’re talking again.
00:10:57.740,00:11:05.831,"Top of your class at Cornell and Columbia Law. Had your pick of jobs, but instead chose to work in environmental law– until last month."
00:11:05.915,00:11:08.501,Well– And he used to be a really great figure skater.
00:11:08.585,00:11:13.672,"- Why’d you quit? - His sister lost interest, and then there was– He means my job."
00:11:13.756,00:11:16.050,Could tell me about figure skating too.
00:11:16.134,00:11:18.260,"Um, well, it was– She did lose interest."
00:11:18.344,00:11:20.012,That’s enough.
00:11:20.096,00:11:21.972,"Ay, qué linda. Ay, qué linda."
00:11:22.056,00:11:24.433,"Oh, my gosh. I didn’t know you guys were gonna be here."
00:11:24.517,00:11:26.435,Mwah!
00:11:28.521,00:11:30.356,"Oh, I know. Come here, sweetie."
00:11:34.611,00:11:37.696,Ay. But I’m gonna buy her some shoes first.
00:11:37.780,00:11:40.366,"What’s that, Lily? Do you want me to buy you a dress?"
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.201,She said yes.
00:11:42.285,00:11:44.287,Yes?
00:11:49.125,00:11:50.709,"Okay, Win on three."
00:11:53.129,00:11:55.631,Don’t forget the pick and roll. These guys won’t know how to defend it.
00:11:55.715,00:11:57.967,"Phil, try not to confuse my boys, okay?"
00:11:59.469,00:12:00.553,Good luck!
00:12:00.637,00:12:02.555,All right. Let’s go! Let’s go! Come on. Let’s go!
00:12:08.394,00:12:11.814,"All right. Keep the hustle, keep the hustle. Come on, boys. Don’t let ’em push you around."
00:12:11.898,00:12:14.400,"Oh! All right, little defense!"
00:12:14.484,00:12:16.485,Play defense!
00:12:16.569,00:12:19.238,"I did a little scouting, and the other team only has two shooters."
00:12:24.369,00:12:26.245,What?
00:12:26.329,00:12:28.623,Oh!
00:12:33.670,00:12:37.464,"So, tell me this. What are the regulatory challenges of a solar farm?"
00:12:37.548,00:12:44.263,"Uh, well, you know, it could be anything– uh, agricultural– military, protected species, ironically, even some, uh, environmental groups."
00:12:44.347,00:12:45.848,I think you got all of it.
00:12:45.932,00:12:48.100,Mmm. Think you got it.
00:12:48.184,00:12:49.686,Yeah. I’m just gonna freshen this up.
00:12:51.854,00:12:54.315,Let me ask you a question.
00:12:54.399,00:12:57.026,How do you like the beard? I’m thinking of growing one. Jenny’s against it.
00:12:57.110,00:12:59.946,"Oh. Well, I-I’ve been very happy with mine."
00:13:01.072,00:13:02.990,That’s it. I’m doin’ it.
00:13:03.074,00:13:05.284,"Look, I’ve made a fortune. I want to use it for some good."
00:13:05.368,00:13:07.828,I need a lawyer to help me navigate.
00:13:07.912,00:13:11.582,"I like you. You get me. So, in or out?"
00:13:11.666,00:13:19.965,Wow. I just– - I’m very sorry. - It’s okay.
00:13:20.049,00:13:23.010,"Um, that’s a very big question."
00:13:23.094,00:13:27.014,"You know, I’m obviously gonna have to go talk to my– bull in a china shop."
00:13:27.098,00:13:30.643,I’ll be right back.
00:13:30.727,00:13:33.855,"Hey, Jenny! The beard is on!"
00:13:35.857,00:13:39.109,"Okay, Lily, it’s time to buy you beautiful shoes."
00:13:41.904,00:13:45.824,Ay. But she has already six new dresses. What she needs is strappy shoes.
00:13:45.908,00:13:48.953,"Oh– Oh, oh. There’s Alex. I’ll-I’ll see you later."
00:13:49.037,00:13:51.538,"Alex, honey. Hi."
00:13:51.622,00:13:54.375,"Mom, I said I’d meet you at the car."
00:13:58.629,00:14:01.382,Mmm. Here.
00:14:01.466,00:14:03.384,Thank you.
00:14:03.468,00:14:05.719,Still wish you had a daughter?
00:14:05.803,00:14:09.848,Manny didn’t want me at the game today.
00:14:09.932,00:14:13.686,It’s okay.
00:14:13.770,00:14:16.647,I miss babies. They never tell you to go away.
00:14:16.731,00:14:19.108,Yeah. Or wait in the car.
00:14:19.192,00:14:22.027,"I don’t know about you, but I’m not gonna stand here and feel sorry for myself."
00:14:22.111,00:14:23.612,You know what we should do?
00:14:23.696,00:14:25.739,Get pregnant.
00:14:25.823,00:14:27.866,I was gonna say go for ice cream.
00:14:27.950,00:14:30.452,Okay. We’ll do yours first.
00:14:32.914,00:14:36.333,It’s hard to guard a player if there’s no player near you!
00:14:40.505,00:14:44.550,"I hear you. Um, one thing that might help– instead of a zone, if you switch to a simple man-to-man."
00:14:44.634,00:14:46.218,I got this.
00:14:46.302,00:14:49.138,"’Cause according to the scoreboard, the only thing you got is four points."
00:14:49.222,00:14:50.431,Good luck.
00:14:53.017,00:14:55.602,I need to talk to you.
00:14:55.686,00:14:57.730,Nice top.
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.661,I want you to take the job.
00:15:12.745,00:15:23.338,"I thought you liked having me home with Lily. I– I don’t. I mean, I do. I just– I miss my time with Lily, and I know it’s selfish of me, but– No, I want the job."
00:15:23.422,00:15:27.676,"Oh, my God, yes. I– I love Lily, but I hate baby talk."
00:15:27.760,00:15:30.345,I wuv baby talk.
00:15:30.429,00:15:32.806,Oh!
00:15:32.890,00:15:35.934,Let’s go get this job.
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.978,Okay.
00:15:38.062,00:15:39.980,It’s locked.
00:15:43.693,00:15:45.110,"Oh, my gosh."
00:15:45.194,00:15:47.112,They’re not gonna hear us. We’re trapped out here.
00:15:47.196,00:15:52.951,"Just stop being so dramatic. We’ll just go through the garage, with the– That’s why he wants to hire you. You’re good in crisis."
00:15:53.035,00:16:05.214,"Ooh, yeesh. What– It’s not opening."
00:16:05.298,00:16:07.633,"I’m hearing things, but it’s not– Push it harder."
00:16:10.344,00:16:11.721,I hear something. What is that?
00:16:14.348,00:16:26.819,"No. Stop touching– Stop– Mitchell! Oh, my God. Did– No!"
00:16:26.903,00:16:28.362,"Oh, my God! No, Cam!"
00:16:28.446,00:16:31.240,"Cam, we– Did we do that?"
00:16:31.324,00:16:34.035,Oh– Oh.
00:16:35.244,00:16:36.871,I will take the job.
00:16:38.164,00:16:41.167,Kinda think you have to now.
00:16:45.463,00:16:46.880,Time out!
00:16:50.134,00:16:53.846,"Guys, earlier we practiced a few set plays."
00:16:57.642,00:16:59.601,But you said to be aggressive. Yeah!
00:16:59.685,00:17:02.104,Not on your own team! Wait here.
00:17:05.775,00:17:08.360,You talkin’ to me?
00:17:13.783,00:17:16.201,I was dealing with the coach. You pushed me aside.
00:17:16.285,00:17:18.328,I was dealing with the boys. You pushed me aside.
00:17:18.412,00:17:21.373,"Believe it or not, Jay, there are some things that I am better at than you are."
00:17:21.457,00:17:23.542,Bam! It’s out there.
00:17:23.626,00:17:26.295,Coach!
00:17:26.379,00:17:28.922,Listen. I don’t blame you for being angry. All right?
00:17:29.006,00:17:31.133,I’m used to taking charge. That’s all.
00:17:31.217,00:17:34.470,I should have let you coach from the get-go.
00:17:37.598,00:17:40.058,I love you.
00:17:42.311,00:17:45.982,I’m sure your steaks would have been delicious... and not chewy.
00:17:47.316,00:17:49.985,Okay. I’ll do it.
00:17:55.324,00:17:57.910,"Hey, hey. Guys. Who wants to go out like a champ?"
00:17:57.994,00:17:59.077,Yeah!
00:17:59.161,00:18:01.788,"I love it! Okay, Jordy, you inbound to Luke."
00:18:01.872,00:18:04.625,"Manny, you set a pick on Luke’s man and roll to the bucket."
00:18:04.709,00:18:07.419,"Luke, you know what to do."
00:18:07.503,00:18:09.922,Bounce-pass to Manny.
00:18:07.503,00:18:13.926,"But, Dad– Coach, Manny hasn’t taken a single shot all season."
00:18:14.010,00:18:15.844,Then chances are he’ll be open.
00:18:18.014,00:18:22.184,"Hey, hey. Bring it in. Let’s show these guys what kind of team they’re about to beat."
00:18:22.268,00:18:24.186,Huh? Li’l Dribblers on three.
00:18:36.490,00:18:39.201,- Give a kid a bird– - Yes!
00:18:39.285,00:18:43.497,and he becomes one of those weird dudes who walks around with a bird on his shoulder.
00:18:43.581,00:18:50.003,"But give him a pair of wings, he can fly."
00:18:51.380,00:18:53.799,Unless he has absolutely no hand-eye coordination.
00:18:53.883,00:18:56.760,"Okay, I support you."
00:19:03.768,00:19:05.352,That was 20 minutes.
00:19:05.436,00:19:09.815,"Mom, I am so, so sorry."
00:19:09.899,00:19:15.404,"I know it’s no excuse, but I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure at school."
00:19:15.488,00:19:17.531,"You know, with friends."
00:19:17.615,00:19:21.494,"And I love you so much, and I appreciate everything you do for me."
00:19:22.787,00:19:25.206,I’m still your little girl.
00:19:27.625,00:19:31.003,"Oh, honey! That was so sweet."
00:19:31.087,00:19:36.508,"Can I get $20? A bunch of us are going to a movie, and we’re gonna get something to eat afterwards."
00:19:36.592,00:19:39.219,Jenna’s brother’s gonna take us home.
00:19:45.101,00:19:47.770,"Thanks, Mom."
00:19:50.481,00:19:55.610,"Oh, Alex, honey? When you’re out shopping, you might wanna pick yourself up a training bra."
00:19:55.694,00:19:59.197,"I know you don’t need one now, but your little boobies are gonna come in soon."
00:19:59.281,00:20:01.158,"Mommy loves you, kitten!"
00:20:01.242,00:20:03.160,Mwah! Mwah!
00:20:03.244,00:20:06.497,Teach her to screw with me.
00:20:11.794,00:20:14.421,I set a pick and then rolled towards the basket.
00:20:23.180,00:20:28.602,"And then I stole the ball from the other team, did a 360 and almost dunked it."
00:20:33.649,00:20:35.609,That girl’s so sweet.
00:20:35.693,00:20:38.737,I have a game next Saturday. You could come.
00:20:41.824,00:20:45.619,I’ll probably take Lily out for cupcakes. Mm-hmm.
00:20:45.703,00:20:47.413,Okay.
00:20:48.914,00:20:51.249,Any suggestions?
00:20:51.333,00:20:53.335,I usually go with earrings.
00:00:04.087,00:00:06.339,Honeydew! What’s up?
00:00:06.423,00:00:09.134,Guess who’s here. Your dad!
00:00:12.971,00:00:15.306,"Hey, Son, working hard?"
00:00:15.390,00:00:17.392,He’s gonna say Hardly working.
00:00:17.476,00:00:20.395,I meant to tell you he was driving out.
00:00:20.479,00:00:22.230,Did he say it?
00:00:25.776,00:00:28.444,"Well, guess what he brought us."
00:00:28.528,00:00:31.114,A dog... to keep.
00:00:31.198,00:00:33.366,Yes! Yes.
00:00:33.450,00:00:37.662,"Yes, I should have told Claire about the dog, and I was going to."
00:00:37.746,00:00:40.457,But I was just waiting for her to be in the right mood.
00:00:42.376,00:00:48.089,"Actually, I did get one right mood a couple nights ago, but I cashed that in for something else."
00:00:48.173,00:00:52.927,"- Am I in trouble? - Oh, really, really big."
00:01:07.401,00:01:09.861,I went to high school with Mitch. We were in the drama club together.
00:01:14.324,00:01:16.951,"You know, you and Mitch knocked The Sunshine Boys out of the park."
00:01:20.038,00:01:22.790,"Yeah, he’s got a real job now. He’s a lawyer. How about you?"
00:01:22.874,00:01:25.627,Still acting.
00:01:25.711,00:01:28.588,"Actually, it’s exciting. I’m in a new movie, Maple Drive. Just came out."
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.343,"Uh, anyway, I got to go."
00:01:33.427,00:01:36.054,Great to see you.
00:01:40.684,00:01:43.603,And I got a free toothbrush.
00:01:46.356,00:01:48.608,"Well, you’re supposed to floss too, but you got away with that one."
00:01:48.692,00:01:50.652,Come on. Let’s go.
00:01:52.738,00:01:56.491,was when my old man sprung me from school and took me to the track.
00:01:56.575,00:02:02.873,"I wanted to do the same type of thing for Manny, plus I figured when Gloria heard about it, maybe it pays off in the bedroom."
00:02:04.291,00:02:06.335,I wonder if that’s why my old man did it.
00:02:07.336,00:02:09.295,"Oh, crap."
00:02:11.965,00:02:14.008,Turns out she’s allergic.
00:02:14.092,00:02:17.971,And the pet store didn’t have a grace period or a return policy or anything?
00:02:18.055,00:02:19.931,I got him from the pound.
00:02:20.015,00:02:24.560,Was there a twister in Kansas? ’Cause there’s a house in my driveway.
00:02:24.644,00:02:28.147,"Welcome home, Mr. Dunphy."
00:02:28.231,00:02:31.901,"Indeed it is, Mr. Dunphy. Place it there."
00:02:31.985,00:02:35.113,"- Oh, I shall. I shall. - I miss this. Get in here."
00:02:36.740,00:02:39.993,He’s awesome. He’s always up. He’s always happy.
00:02:40.077,00:02:43.329,"I mean, he and I are best buds. We’re like two peas in a pod."
00:02:43.413,00:02:46.958,Or Siamese twins. Or a snake with two heads.
00:02:47.042,00:02:50.003,They’ve actually been all those things for Halloween.
00:02:50.087,00:02:52.380,"Oy. This must be Scout, huh?"
00:02:52.464,00:02:56.175,I should warn you. He sheds. I made the mistake of letting him sleep with me on the road.
00:02:56.259,00:02:59.679,Now my sheets look like two bigfoots did it. Pardon the language.
00:02:59.763,00:03:03.016,"Speaking of big feet, eh?"
00:03:03.100,00:03:07.353,"She’s on a cruise with her girlfriends, some of which are not totally unattractive."
00:03:07.437,00:03:10.565,"Oh, that reminds me. She sent some gifts for the kids."
00:03:10.649,00:03:12.567,"Um, I will be right back."
00:03:12.651,00:03:15.611,- You three get better acquainted. - Will do!
00:03:15.695,00:03:17.196,Bye!
00:03:17.280,00:03:19.949,I cannot believe you got a dog without consulting me.
00:03:20.033,00:03:22.118,This was a major family decision.
00:03:22.202,00:03:23.703,It was wrong.
00:03:23.787,00:03:24.954,And I’m sorry.
00:03:25.038,00:03:28.791,"But we have talked about getting a dog for years, and you’re the only one who wasn’t into it."
00:03:28.875,00:03:31.210,Because I knew that I would be the one taking care of it.
00:03:31.294,00:03:32.795,That’s not true.
00:03:31.294,00:03:35.214,"Uh– No, we will all help."
00:03:35.298,00:03:38.885,This is a great chance to teach the kids responsibility.
00:03:38.969,00:03:41.638,That is exactly what you said about Luke’s paper route.
00:04:00.907,00:04:03.785,Hello?
00:04:03.869,00:04:06.163,Is anyone in there?
00:04:29.686,00:04:34.482,"Look at his little face. I always wanted a dog. Thanks, Grandpa."
00:04:36.860,00:04:39.028,Everyone in the family has to pitch in.
00:04:42.199,00:04:44.283,"Oh, phew. ’Cause I got a lot on my plate right now."
00:04:46.703,00:04:49.997,"Hey, we heard about the new addition and we had to come right over."
00:04:50.081,00:04:54.210,"Cameron, so good to see you again. Now that is a shirt."
00:04:54.294,00:04:56.879,"Oh, well, thank you, Frank. I get ’em online. I’ll send you a link."
00:04:56.963,00:04:59.924,"Oh, well, at home, I smoke sausages. I’ll send you a link."
00:05:01.718,00:05:04.429,And this must be Lily.
00:05:06.389,00:05:10.351,I think she’s good right here. Let me get in there and get some of that doggyness.
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.854,"Oh, there it is."
00:05:14.606,00:05:17.650,What’s wrong?
00:05:17.734,00:05:21.988,What? Why?
00:05:26.451,00:05:28.369,Maybe you can find another drummer.
00:05:30.747,00:05:32.373,I play drums.
00:05:32.457,00:05:40.214,"Well, I mean, I haven’t played in a while, since Lily’s come along, but if you’re in a jam, I can jam."
00:05:40.298,00:05:44.427,"Well, I totally would, but I’m not sure we like the same sorts of music, you know?"
00:05:44.511,00:05:46.512,"What, because I’m gay, I’m just gonna want to play show tunes?"
00:05:46.596,00:05:48.723,"No, because you’re old."
00:05:49.933,00:05:51.893,"Wow. That hurt more, Dylan."
00:05:51.977,00:05:54.520,Give him a chance. It’s better than canceling.
00:05:54.604,00:05:58.649,You’re right. I don’t want to lose the deposit on that fog machine.
00:06:00.777,00:06:03.988,"I used to be a music teacher, but I gave that up as soon as Lily came along."
00:06:04.072,00:06:06.073,"Yes. Well, we just felt that it was really important..."
00:06:24.301,00:06:26.219,"How you doin’, buddy?"
00:06:26.303,00:06:28.972,"All right, relax."
00:06:43.653,00:06:45.655,"Oh, geez."
00:06:50.702,00:06:53.621,"I am telling you, Phil, the man was crying."
00:06:53.705,00:06:55.915,That is impossible. My dad is the happiest guy on earth.
00:06:55.999,00:06:57.625,It probably just sounded like he was crying.
00:07:06.593,00:07:10.472,She’s on a cruise.
00:07:06.593,00:07:14.642,"Yeah, and they never take separate vacations, so– No. No, if something was wrong, my dad would tell me about it."
00:07:14.726,00:07:17.895,"No, Phil, he wouldn’t, because you guys never actually talk about anything."
00:07:17.979,00:07:20.940,"We talk all the time. He crank calls me at work, like, three times a week."
00:07:23.026,00:07:26.946,"No, honestly, I think that you should find out what’s going on with your dad."
00:07:27.030,00:07:30.950,It’s going to be nothing. My dad isn’t like your dad.
00:07:31.034,00:07:33.119,There’s nothing deep and dark inside.
00:07:33.203,00:07:36.622,His hard candy shell is just hiding more candy.
00:07:40.794,00:07:45.214,Smart dog.
00:07:54.557,00:07:56.892,Should I just play a little something?
00:08:09.906,00:08:12.909,So... here we go.
00:08:28.216,00:08:30.176,Hmm.
00:08:30.260,00:08:32.261,"Oh, silly me."
00:08:32.345,00:08:34.848,I had the sticks in the wrong hands.
00:08:52.031,00:08:53.866,Wow.
00:09:05.879,00:09:08.547,It’s not the alarm. The doorbell won’t stop ringing.
00:09:08.631,00:09:10.466,Maybe a demon is ringing it.
00:09:10.550,00:09:13.761,¡Ay! Who keeps ringing the doorbell?
00:09:18.433,00:09:20.393,"If it were a demon, it would keep on ringing."
00:09:20.477,00:09:23.688,Not if he’s already inside. I’m getting a weapon.
00:09:23.772,00:09:26.023,What were you thinking?
00:09:26.107,00:09:29.151,"Who takes a little boy to a horror movie? That’s loco, Jay."
00:09:29.235,00:09:31.320,This is no big deal. You want scary?
00:09:34.616,00:09:36.742,I slept with a butter knife under my pillow...
00:09:39.496,00:09:42.581,Why would they send a Soviet colonel to get a little boy?
00:09:45.335,00:09:47.461,What are we talking about?
00:09:47.545,00:09:49.755,"Look, all I’m saying, being scared is part of growing up."
00:10:02.352,00:10:04.312,Character.
00:10:07.357,00:10:09.608,Come on in! It’s open!
00:10:09.692,00:10:12.069,"Ah, don’t tell me. You need a cup of sugar."
00:10:15.031,00:10:20.870,"I was just wondering, I don’t know, uh– Anything on the old noodle?"
00:10:20.954,00:10:24.623,"Other than a bad toupee? I’m kidding, of course. This is my real hair."
00:10:24.707,00:10:28.127,"Well, okay."
00:10:28.211,00:10:31.547,Am I putting you in a bad position with this whole dog thing?
00:10:31.631,00:10:34.800,Claire seemed a little put out.
00:10:34.884,00:10:39.346,Claire didn’t like me at first either. I can’t blame her. Dismissed!
00:10:48.064,00:10:50.567,What is it?
00:10:53.611,00:10:57.448,"Would you wear pants to breakfast, for crying out loud?"
00:10:57.532,00:11:00.409,You got me again. Right in the funny bone.
00:11:00.493,00:11:02.536,"Come on, Scout. Let go of it."
00:11:02.620,00:11:04.789,"No, no, no! Oh!"
00:11:07.083,00:11:09.335,How did he get ahold of your bra?
00:11:09.419,00:11:14.965,"Well, uh, we were out on a date, and he has a really nice car, so– How do you think? He got it out of the laundry basket."
00:11:15.049,00:11:17.259,Can’t take my eyes off that dog for a second.
00:11:17.343,00:11:19.804,- Why don’t you just keep him in the crate? - I tried that.
00:11:19.888,00:11:23.015,He figured out how to get out. I thought you were dealing with your dad.
00:11:23.099,00:11:28.479,"Oh, yeah, I did. He’s fine, so– Whoa! You got that from a two-minute conversation?"
00:11:36.988,00:11:39.365,"Phil, the man needs more of a push than that."
00:11:39.449,00:11:43.452,"Look, if he wants to talk to me about it, he will."
00:11:43.536,00:11:45.454,"Geez, someone’s panties are in a bunch."
00:11:48.291,00:11:51.377,"Oh, my God! That damn dog!"
00:11:51.461,00:11:54.213,"Guys, little help?"
00:11:54.297,00:11:57.717,"I have to go to the bathroom, and I’m not gonna do it in here."
00:12:05.683,00:12:09.937,"- Hey, I got Chinese. - Sweet! I’m starving."
00:12:17.403,00:12:19.738,I’ll always remember him as the stranger holding my baby.
00:12:19.822,00:12:22.283,Can I talk to you in the kitchen for a second?
00:12:22.367,00:12:25.619,"Yeah. Hey, guys, let’s, uh– let’s just take five."
00:12:25.703,00:12:27.746,What’s up with 21 Jump Street?
00:12:31.000,00:12:34.128,"No, no. We have Pepper’s après-ski fondue party tomorrow night, Cam."
00:12:34.212,00:12:36.130,"Oh, no."
00:12:36.214,00:12:39.174,So you’ll just have to tell your band that they’re gonna have to find someone else.
00:12:39.258,00:12:42.261,You know what? No. I’m not gonna let these fellas down. I made a commitment.
00:12:46.849,00:12:49.018,He gets mad if you don’t wear a big sweater.
00:12:52.355,00:12:54.356,"So I’m going by myself, is that what you’re saying?"
00:12:57.193,00:12:59.945,To round out your college applications?
00:13:00.029,00:13:02.615,It’s just that because I’m always home with Lily...
00:13:07.954,00:13:10.789,It’s like the Golden Gate Bridge.
00:13:10.873,00:13:13.459,I’m gonna go back to jamming.
00:13:20.550,00:13:22.719,"Yeah, we gotta fix this."
00:13:32.562,00:13:35.606,"Hey, what’s with the big sweater at a concert? Is that a gay thing?"
00:13:41.821,00:13:44.949,Hope they start soon. I don’t think Scout likes to be left alone.
00:13:48.578,00:13:50.788,"No, I don’t love the dog. I love my couch."
00:13:50.872,00:13:53.832,And the dog was looking at it like it was a giant sausage.
00:13:53.916,00:13:56.126,"Good news, you two. You’re getting your driveway back."
00:13:56.210,00:13:58.796,I’m hitting the open road in the morning.
00:13:58.880,00:14:00.756,Yeah.
00:14:11.267,00:14:15.145,He’s not going home? He’s never been away from my mom for longer than a doctor’s appointment.
00:14:15.229,00:14:17.147,"Honey, I know. I told you."
00:14:17.231,00:14:19.483,I always felt bad for people with emotionally distant fathers.
00:14:19.567,00:14:21.026,It turns out I’m one of ’em.
00:14:21.110,00:14:24.405,It’s a miracle I didn’t end up a stripper.
00:14:24.489,00:14:26.407,"Hey. Thanks, everybody, for coming out."
00:14:26.491,00:14:28.450,These are some songs we wrote.
00:14:44.759,00:14:47.511,Our boyfriends totally rock!
00:14:49.639,00:14:51.348,"Well, the plan was..."
00:14:57.271,00:15:00.274,But he was so great up there.
00:15:00.358,00:15:01.942,How-How could I leave?
00:15:08.658,00:15:10.159,It was his moment.
00:15:12.537,00:15:14.413,I know!
00:15:26.050,00:15:31.681,"And his moment went on for a really, really long time."
00:15:59.542,00:16:02.878,Your bed.
00:16:09.010,00:16:10.970,We’ll speak no more of it now.
00:16:13.389,00:16:16.850,"Hey, Jay, it’s Ben Dugan. I got your message."
00:16:19.729,00:16:22.981,What’s that?
00:16:23.065,00:16:27.361,"I figure when Manny sees him, sees how nice he is, he’ll realize it’s all pretend."
00:16:35.244,00:16:38.330,Manny’s gonna spend two minutes with him. He’ll explain how the movie’s made.
00:16:38.414,00:16:42.376,He’s even bringing his fake machete. Thing’s made of rubber.
00:16:49.425,00:16:52.511,"Hey, are you Manny? I’m here for you."
00:16:53.471,00:16:54.680,Look what I got.
00:16:59.936,00:17:01.687,¿Qué pasó? ¿Qué pasó? ¿Qué pasó?
00:17:05.775,00:17:08.068,We’re gonna need a bigger bed!
00:17:14.158,00:17:16.160,"Oh, my God! I think that’s him."
00:17:16.244,00:17:19.037,Hey. You stayed.
00:17:19.121,00:17:20.998,"Well, you know, I’m-I’m with the band."
00:17:21.082,00:17:29.339,"I thought the gig was a little sloppy in spots, but I think once I learn all the songs– I thought– I thought this was a one-time thing?"
00:17:29.423,00:17:31.216,Are you kidding? We destroyed in there.
00:17:31.300,00:17:33.218,Did you hear that one lady screaming my name?
00:17:33.302,00:17:36.388,That was Phil. He had a Red Bull.
00:17:36.472,00:17:39.057,"Hey, guys. Good gig, huh?"
00:17:39.141,00:17:41.727,"- Yeah. Totally awesome, man. - Heck of a gig."
00:17:41.811,00:17:45.439,"Hey, guys."
00:17:45.523,00:17:48.150,No. My parents broke up again.
00:17:56.284,00:17:58.411,Uh– Cam.
00:18:00.496,00:18:02.498,"Oh, awkward for me."
00:18:07.003,00:18:09.213,"Good luck following that, Ringo."
00:18:12.174,00:18:14.259,I believe this belongs to you.
00:18:17.096,00:18:18.805,"Come here, you little monkeys."
00:18:18.889,00:18:20.390,"Bye, Grandpa. We’ll miss you."
00:18:20.474,00:18:21.934,I wish I could take you with me.
00:18:24.520,00:18:26.271,You sure you don’t want to stay for breakfast?
00:18:26.355,00:18:29.150,"No, I ought to be hitting the road."
00:18:31.861,00:18:33.362,"Dad, hold on."
00:18:33.446,00:18:35.364,Can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
00:18:39.201,00:18:42.579,I don’t think you’re being honest with me.
00:18:42.663,00:18:45.458,I– I know something is going on with you.
00:18:46.459,00:18:48.377,What’s up?
00:18:48.461,00:18:52.381,"Something up? Well, my boxers are, uh, riding a little high."
00:18:52.465,00:18:54.800,"I’m not in the mood for jokes right now, although you nailed that."
00:18:56.427,00:18:58.429,Thanks.
00:18:59.430,00:19:03.558,It’s nothing.
00:19:03.642,00:19:06.437,Nothing to do with Mom?
00:19:07.438,00:19:12.484,"Well, yeah. I’ve fallen in love."
00:19:18.741,00:19:21.493,It’s that little guy right over there.
00:19:21.577,00:19:23.412,Come on over here. Come on.
00:19:23.496,00:19:26.540,"Come on. There you go. Ah, look at him."
00:19:26.624,00:19:32.421,"Driving across country, this little bastard nuzzled his way right into my heart, didn’t ya?"
00:19:36.425,00:19:39.177,Those three days on the road with him were the happiest of my life.
00:19:39.261,00:19:41.221,You should leave that part out.
00:19:41.305,00:19:44.308,I don’t want to keep Scout if it makes Grandpa sad.
00:19:44.392,00:19:49.104,"Yeah, I know, sweetie. But Grandma has allergies, so Scout has to stay with us."
00:19:49.188,00:19:51.940,"Well, she could always just get some allergy shots."
00:19:54.110,00:19:56.903,"Hell, back in the day, I got a vasectomy for her."
00:19:56.987,00:19:59.865,Dad. Dad. Please.
00:19:59.949,00:20:01.867,Scout’s– Scout’s your dog.
00:20:01.951,00:20:03.953,He should go with you.
00:20:10.209,00:20:14.254,"Thanks, Son. Thanks for poking through the armor."
00:20:14.338,00:20:16.381,You’re poking through the armor down there.
00:20:18.342,00:20:20.010,You are a treasure.
00:20:20.094,00:20:22.220,"Come on, Scout. Let’s mosey."
00:20:22.304,00:20:23.973,"Oh, oh, oh! Oh, wait."
00:20:26.642,00:20:28.894,"He loves that, yeah."
00:20:28.978,00:20:32.564,"No, Scout. This time I drive."
00:20:35.651,00:20:40.114,"I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I think I might have actually gotten even closer with my dad."
00:20:42.116,00:20:44.910,I can’t believe he took my dog.
00:20:44.994,00:20:46.828,Bye-bye.
00:20:48.497,00:20:51.083,"Bye, Grandpa! I love you!"
00:20:51.167,00:20:53.043,"Luke, stay!"
00:20:53.127,00:20:54.252,"Luke, stay!"
00:20:54.336,00:20:55.963,Luke!
00:21:01.260,00:21:03.053,"Hey, Jay. Good to see you."
00:21:03.137,00:21:05.722,Great to see you. Didn’t expect to find you here.
00:21:05.806,00:21:10.060,"Well, listen, when my granddaughter’s boyfriend’s band plays an under-21 club..."
00:21:10.144,00:21:13.480,"with my daughter-in-law’s brother’s gay partner, I show up."
00:21:13.564,00:21:15.440,That’s just how I was raised.
00:21:15.524,00:21:18.276,"I don’t think you met my wife, Gloria."
00:21:21.780,00:21:24.491,You must be Frank.
00:21:21.780,00:21:28.787,"Okay, then, you are hotter than a Las Vegas sidewalk on the Fourth of July."
00:21:28.871,00:21:30.998,Did I go too far?
00:02:51.421,00:00:07.006,"four hours earlier four hours earlier four hours earlier Oh, I forgot to ask– Did it hurt?"
00:00:07.090,00:00:10.510,What hurt?
00:00:20.520,00:00:24.816,"Today’s Jay’s birthday, so I’m taking him to Hawaii for a whole week."
00:00:24.900,00:00:27.652,Big suite in Maui. Just the two of us.
00:00:27.736,00:00:31.197,Got Manny tied up in the backyard. Big bowl of kibble.
00:00:31.281,00:00:33.616,I’m kidding. He’s staying with Claire and Phil.
00:00:35.786,00:00:39.205,"I did it all myself– the flight, the hotels."
00:00:39.289,00:00:42.375,"Cost me a fortune, but it was worth it."
00:00:46.004,00:00:50.008,"In case I forget to say it a few hundred times this week, thank you."
00:00:58.183,00:01:00.226,- They are? - Uh-huh.
00:01:00.310,00:01:02.103,"Yes, and Mitch and Cameron and Lily too."
00:01:02.187,00:01:04.397,"Yeah, and Phil– he’s just checking the bags."
00:01:04.481,00:01:06.482,"That’s, uh– Wow."
00:01:06.566,00:01:09.027,It was all Gloria’s idea. She bought all of our tickets and everything.
00:01:09.111,00:01:11.070,Really? Everyone’s?
00:01:11.154,00:01:15.783,"- It’s your birthday. I didn’t spare any expense. - Oh, gee! Thank you, honey."
00:01:18.578,00:01:22.040,"Ay, no, silly. Coach. You think I’m made of money?"
00:01:22.124,00:01:23.959,Of course not.
00:01:39.933,00:01:49.192,"We’re gonna go to a luau, swim with the Miami Dolphins, Helicopter. Helicopter."
00:01:51.278,00:01:54.530,I wanted to hang out with Gloria and read my Robert Ludlum novels.
00:01:54.614,00:01:57.283,I got eight of ’em loaded up on my book reader thing here.
00:01:57.367,00:01:59.285,"I mean, I love my family."
00:01:59.369,00:02:03.790,"I love ’em at dinners, I love ’em at barbecues, but do I have to love ’em in Hawaii?"
00:02:03.874,00:02:05.750,"Thanks, Daryl."
00:02:05.834,00:02:08.795,"I know I got a lot of baggage, but don’t worry, I’m seeing a therapist."
00:02:11.340,00:02:13.800,Hey!
00:02:13.884,00:02:17.679,"Daryl, I know these guys. Can I borrow your hat? This will be hilarious."
00:02:17.763,00:02:19.806,No.
00:02:19.890,00:02:23.017,Hey! You guys excited about the trip?
00:02:23.101,00:02:25.520,"Oh, we’re so excited. You know, this is my first time."
00:02:25.604,00:02:27.480,Really?
00:02:27.564,00:02:30.149,People always say I scream Hawaii.
00:02:30.233,00:02:31.693,People.
00:02:31.777,00:02:34.571,You don’t know them.
00:02:35.655,00:02:40.827,"Oh, no! Oh, n– I forgot my wallet."
00:02:40.911,00:02:43.413,"No, no. I can’t get on the plane without my I.D."
00:02:43.497,00:02:46.040,"Thanks a lot, Cam."
00:02:56.426,00:02:59.387,"Oh, stop the newspaper."
00:02:59.471,00:03:01.180,Wait. What are you doing? I just packed those.
00:03:04.434,00:03:06.185,Nothing you just said made any sense to me.
00:03:06.269,00:03:08.896,Jasper and his mother are coming over for a playdate. We scheduled it weeks ago.
00:03:08.980,00:03:11.316,- We’re about to leave for the airport. - Not for an hour.
00:03:14.611,00:03:16.946,"This is a coup. When you get in with Jasper, doors open."
00:03:17.030,00:03:18.906,He’s a legacy at Happy Time Preschool.
00:03:18.990,00:03:21.659,- We’re kissing up to a 10-month-old? - I just want him to like us.
00:03:23.787,00:03:26.205,But just in and out. We still have a million things to do.
00:03:26.289,00:03:29.251,Would you relax? You always worry. It always gets done.
00:03:30.210,00:03:37.050,"Oh, and we’re Methodists, so– Uh, who am I kidding? I’m not making this flight."
00:03:37.134,00:03:40.720,Uh-uh. I can get you home and back before the plane takes off. Let’s go.
00:03:44.433,00:03:46.517,That’s– I will get to you later.
00:03:48.979,00:03:50.646,Go. I’ll meet you at the gate. Go.
00:03:55.819,00:03:56.986,Just go!
00:03:59.656,00:04:04.160,I can’t– Oh! That’s as fast as she goes.
00:04:04.244,00:04:06.288,Just drive.
00:04:12.544,00:04:14.212,I know.
00:04:20.844,00:04:23.346,"- Oh, he drove Mitchell back to get his wallet. - What?"
00:04:23.430,00:04:27.308,"Yeah. He said he’s gonna make it back in time, but I think it’s gonna be close."
00:04:27.392,00:04:30.144,So he left me here.
00:04:30.228,00:04:33.606,"four hours earlier Haley is still asleep, and I have no idea where Luke is."
00:04:33.690,00:04:37.151,- And are you even ready? - My bag’s in the living room. Everything’s gonna be okay.
00:04:37.235,00:04:39.445,Okay. Fine. I’m sorry. I’m a little tense.
00:04:39.529,00:04:41.948,Coffee’ll help that.
00:04:42.032,00:04:44.784,We’ve been over this. Air travel is incredibly safe.
00:04:50.081,00:04:53.042,With a movie.
00:04:53.126,00:04:55.670,"You wanna take something, maybe calm your nerves?"
00:04:55.754,00:04:59.215,No. No. I wanna be alert if the kids need me.
00:04:59.299,00:05:02.802,What a mom. Sometimes I wish you were my mom.
00:05:02.886,00:05:05.847,"Oh, God, Phil. I’m already feeling a little queasy."
00:05:09.392,00:05:11.853,And it’s just gonna get worse and worse until the flight.
00:05:11.937,00:05:15.106,Hey! It’s gonna be fine.
00:05:15.190,00:05:17.316,Uncle Phil’s here.
00:05:17.400,00:05:20.403,"Great job, buddy! First one ready."
00:05:21.571,00:05:23.114,"Haley and Alex, let’s go!"
00:05:24.908,00:05:27.160,"All right. Come on, girls."
00:05:27.244,00:05:28.703,Okay.
00:05:31.206,00:05:33.708,Fifteen seconds. Are we ready?
00:05:38.088,00:05:40.381,"Go, go, go, go, go."
00:05:40.465,00:05:42.842,Straight through. Let’s go. Let’s go.
00:05:42.926,00:05:45.011,Hey! I think we got an extra couple of seconds.
00:05:49.849,00:05:53.728,Mmm. I will never get tired of this.
00:05:53.812,00:05:57.690,"Me neither. You know what would be cool, Mom?"
00:05:57.774,00:06:02.779,If the plane flew into a storm and crash-landed onto an island like in Lost.
00:06:11.371,00:06:14.916,"Something wrong there, Cam?"
00:06:17.627,00:06:20.379,I have an uncle that can only wear bell bottoms. Hand to God.
00:06:23.842,00:06:26.969,Surprise!
00:06:27.053,00:06:29.514,Every morning the whole family’s gonna go hiking.
00:06:29.598,00:06:32.892,"Then at the end of the week, we all gonna make it to the top of the volcano."
00:06:32.976,00:06:34.727,"Every morning, huh?"
00:06:38.148,00:06:40.358,"Oh, so this was your idea?"
00:06:42.694,00:06:45.196,"Hi, sweetheart!"
00:06:47.824,00:06:48.783,Yeah.
00:06:51.828,00:06:55.414,Thank you.
00:06:55.498,00:06:58.417,"Look, Mom, I’m pregnant."
00:07:01.338,00:07:04.632,"Yeah, I throw up all the time."
00:07:04.716,00:07:07.093,What the hell are you doing?
00:07:07.177,00:07:09.845,"Oh, I’m just trying to keep her awake so she’ll sleep on the plane."
00:07:09.929,00:07:13.349,Nobody likes a crying baby on a flight. It’s-It’s very stressful.
00:07:15.685,00:07:19.564,"next to a baby who was very upset the entire flight, and it was hell."
00:07:19.648,00:07:24.652,"I was on that flight with you, and I don’t recall– Oh, I get it. You’re talking about me. That’s very funny."
00:07:24.736,00:07:26.821,"Yeah, we couldn’t get tickets to Billy Elliot."
00:07:29.991,00:07:33.495,Five hours of this.
00:07:37.707,00:07:41.127,"Dramamine. Oh, I wish I had that the last time I flew."
00:07:41.211,00:07:44.088,"Tell you, the plane was rocking up and down, back and forth."
00:07:44.172,00:07:46.632,"I thought the wings were gonna snap off, honestly."
00:07:46.716,00:07:48.718,"Okay, you do it yourself. Use your teeth."
00:07:51.388,00:07:53.848,I-Is this the best way to go? What about the freeway?
00:07:58.395,00:08:01.772,You’re talking to a guy who made his way through college by driving a pedicab.
00:08:01.856,00:08:03.816,You know what one of those is?
00:08:06.736,00:08:08.487,Quick– Who sang Evil Woman?
00:08:08.571,00:08:11.365,ELO!
00:08:15.245,00:08:16.912,You’re supposed to be here with me.
00:08:16.996,00:08:19.874,"I told you, I get more and more freaked out as we get closer to the flight."
00:08:19.958,00:08:21.667,"Well, I know, but Mitch– Okay, you know what?"
00:08:21.751,00:08:26.005,"I was counting on you to be here, so thanks a lot."
00:08:30.510,00:08:33.220,She’s pretty tightly wound.
00:08:33.304,00:08:35.222,Some people are just built that way.
00:08:38.101,00:08:41.228,Guess where the world’s largest wind generator is.
00:08:41.312,00:08:43.522,Is it right behind me?
00:08:43.606,00:08:45.691,Nope. It’s on the island of Oahu.
00:08:45.775,00:08:48.778,I’m thinking about using it in my song about Hawaii.
00:08:51.322,00:08:54.533,The whole family’s putting on a show for you for your birthday.
00:08:54.617,00:08:57.870,Everybody’s performing. Even Phil brought his dummy.
00:09:00.373,00:09:02.291,Jay?
00:09:02.375,00:09:05.294,I was just thinking how tragic it would be if I fell into that volcano.
00:09:05.378,00:09:06.879,"Ay, papi, don’t say that."
00:09:06.963,00:09:09.548,"Ow, ow, ow."
00:09:09.632,00:09:12.469,"Not yet, sweetie. Not yet."
00:09:16.681,00:09:19.934,Look at him getting coffee and not putting chocolate in it. He’s so mature.
00:09:21.811,00:09:24.105,Dylan’s no that guy.
00:09:24.189,00:09:28.651,four hours earlier Haley! Come on! We’re leaving in two minutes! Get up!
00:09:31.488,00:09:33.906,"Oh, my God!"
00:09:33.990,00:09:36.075,Dylan! What are you doing here?
00:09:36.159,00:09:41.288,"I was gonna go, but then you fell asleep, and since you’re leaving for a week, I want to stare at you as long as I could."
00:09:41.372,00:09:43.749,You have to go. My parents are gonna think we did it.
00:09:46.211,00:09:49.088,Get out of the house and make sure that nobody sees you.
00:09:49.172,00:09:51.090,I’ll miss you.
00:09:54.677,00:09:56.804,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That’s beautiful, but you have to go."
00:09:56.888,00:09:58.389,Okay.
00:10:07.524,00:10:10.025,And it’s just gonna get worse and worse until the flight.
00:10:10.109,00:10:12.487,Hey! It’s gonna be fine.
00:10:13.738,00:10:15.698,Uncle Phil’s here.
00:10:15.782,00:10:18.659,"Great job, buddy! First one ready."
00:10:18.743,00:10:20.745,"Haley and Alex, let’s go!"
00:10:22.580,00:10:24.749,"All right. Come on, girls."
00:10:24.833,00:10:26.292,Okay.
00:10:26.376,00:10:28.794,This is why we practice.
00:10:33.424,00:10:35.718,Straight to the car.
00:10:35.802,00:10:38.179,"Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast."
00:10:41.391,00:10:43.225,Hey! I think we got an extra couple of seconds.
00:11:03.204,00:11:04.830,"- Oh, no! - What?"
00:11:04.914,00:11:06.499,My keys!
00:11:08.084,00:11:11.212,"Stay awake, sweetie. Stay awake."
00:11:11.296,00:11:14.256,"Whee! Oh, no."
00:11:14.340,00:11:17.092,This is where your Realtor training comes in handy.
00:11:17.176,00:11:20.721,Looks like a standard Porter and Sons D-Model top lock.
00:11:23.892,00:11:26.644,All aboard.
00:11:26.728,00:11:28.854,Okay.
00:11:30.940,00:11:33.567,"Yeah, you’re pinching. You’re pinching."
00:11:37.447,00:11:40.658,Every Realtor is just a ninja in a blazer.
00:11:40.742,00:11:46.121,"The average burglar breaks in and leaves clues everywhere, but not me."
00:11:49.042,00:11:51.043,You’re sure I’m not too heavy?
00:11:51.127,00:11:53.587,"Please, you weigh less than my paintball gear."
00:11:53.671,00:11:56.298,Okay. Yup.
00:11:56.382,00:11:58.634,Off-load. On we go. Squeezing.
00:11:58.718,00:12:00.970,I’m going for a ride.
00:12:01.054,00:12:02.972,Yup. I’m good. I’m good.
00:12:07.977,00:12:12.398,You got to get up pretty early– Son of a– Are you all right?
00:12:14.734,00:12:17.069,That’s not ours. That’s Jasper’s.
00:12:17.153,00:12:20.072,I sold a house to his parents. How did you ever get a playdate with him?
00:12:20.156,00:12:22.659,"Let’s go! Please, can– yeah."
00:12:26.371,00:12:29.331,He’s like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic.
00:12:31.501,00:12:33.669,Do you think he’s sketching us?
00:12:33.753,00:12:37.256,Yeah. Us.
00:12:40.218,00:12:42.219,And contact.
00:12:48.685,00:12:52.021,"I’m trapped. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What a drama queen."
00:12:55.858,00:13:00.613,"We will go whale washing, explore the tropical forest, get back into the nature."
00:13:00.697,00:13:02.656,Mm-hmm.
00:13:02.740,00:13:04.783,Thanks.
00:13:06.869,00:13:09.496,Will Manny Delgado please report to Gate 22-A?
00:13:09.580,00:13:13.000,Manny Delgado to Gate 22-A.
00:13:13.084,00:13:17.129,"Check it out, Grandpa. The Dramamine’s working. I’m not dizzy."
00:13:17.213,00:13:19.882,"Yeah. Oh, watch the drink, kid."
00:13:21.592,00:13:25.888,"I’m sorry, Grandpa."
00:13:29.267,00:13:32.854,It’s not fair. It’s not fair.
00:13:38.067,00:13:40.027,- Yes. - Your son’s name is on a no-fly list.
00:13:40.111,00:13:43.781,"Ay, please, we’ve been through this at the check-in. He’s not the same Manny Delgado."
00:13:43.865,00:13:46.158,I’m just a boy trying to bring style back to travel.
00:13:46.242,00:13:48.535,"- We just have a few questions to ask. - No, this is a mistake."
00:13:48.619,00:13:50.996,Where is my husband? Wait. Jay!
00:13:57.920,00:14:00.422,You make it a double? I’m traveling with my family.
00:14:00.506,00:14:02.300,No problem.
00:14:06.304,00:14:09.765,Must be a lot easier just living with a guy.
00:14:12.101,00:14:14.186,Do you think you could get in the fast lane?
00:14:14.270,00:14:17.564,"Oh, I could totally get in the fast lane."
00:14:17.648,00:14:20.150,"Oh, I’m getting a text. What does it say?"
00:14:20.234,00:14:22.861,"Um– Oh, G– Well, it’s nothing. It’s the alarm company."
00:14:22.945,00:14:25.239,It says your house was broken into.
00:14:36.626,00:14:39.044,"You pick out a traveler, you come up with their entire story."
00:14:41.130,00:14:46.176,"He’s on his way to Phoenix to visit his grandmother, whose name is, uh– Oh! Pass."
00:14:46.260,00:14:48.178,- Too hard. Your turn. - Okay. Fine.
00:14:48.262,00:14:51.390,"I see a woman, uh, wracked with fear, whose husband has abandoned her."
00:14:51.474,00:14:53.559,- Where? Where? Who is she? - Me.
00:14:53.643,00:14:55.936,I made it perfectly clear to Phil that I needed him here.
00:14:56.020,00:14:58.480,Oh. It’s going around. Mitchell’s mad at me too.
00:14:58.564,00:15:01.442,"He thinks because I didn’t help him pack this morning, he forgot his wallet."
00:15:01.526,00:15:03.777,I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry to be snippy.
00:15:03.861,00:15:06.572,It’s just... I’m a little upset with Cam.
00:15:06.656,00:15:10.284,"I needed his help this morning, and he let me down."
00:15:10.368,00:15:13.746,That doesn’t sound like him. You asked him to do something and he didn’t do it?
00:15:20.002,00:15:22.087,That sounds to me like he was asking for help.
00:15:22.171,00:15:25.424,Sounds to me like you expected him to read your mind.
00:15:25.508,00:15:28.218,"- What am I, a psychic? - No! It’s not about reading minds."
00:15:30.513,00:15:33.015,Here’s an idea: just say help me.
00:15:33.099,00:15:35.100,"You don’t even have to say me, just help."
00:15:35.184,00:15:37.811,Then he’ll know exactly what you want. You won’t have to get all mad.
00:15:49.782,00:15:55.621,"What’s frustrating is I would do anything for Mitchell, and-and frankly, it’s a little hurtful that he doesn’t know that."
00:15:58.541,00:16:01.668,"So, airports, huh?"
00:16:04.213,00:16:08.133,Are you drawing something there?
00:16:08.217,00:16:11.345,Tortured artist. Classic.
00:16:11.429,00:16:13.389,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:14.390,00:16:17.684,It’s a robot.
00:16:17.768,00:16:19.895,What’s behind him?
00:16:34.911,00:16:52.094,I d– What you drinking?
00:16:52.178,00:16:57.349,"Dad. Hey. Mostly tonic actually, thanks to my new sponsor here."
00:17:00.770,00:17:03.021,What are you talking about? You fly all the time.
00:17:05.942,00:17:09.820,"I think I’m just– I’m nervous ’cause I’ve got so much to lose now, you know?"
00:17:09.904,00:17:12.531,What about you?
00:17:12.615,00:17:14.575,We haven’t even started yet.
00:17:14.659,00:17:19.705,"Well, I gotta figure, I might not have a lot of time for myself, you know, what with the luaus, the hiking, the talent shows."
00:17:19.789,00:17:21.874,Are you not happy that we’re coming with you?
00:17:21.958,00:17:24.501,It’s just not what I expected.
00:17:24.585,00:17:27.087,"But, Dad, doesn’t it feel good to know..."
00:17:27.171,00:17:34.344,"that your whole family is willing to drop everything to be with you, to fly across the ocean in a steel coffin?"
00:17:34.428,00:17:35.888,I’m gonna finish that.
00:17:35.972,00:17:37.973,It’s not you guys. I love the family.
00:17:38.057,00:17:39.558,Mm-hmm.
00:17:42.603,00:17:44.605,not to spend time with me.
00:17:46.440,00:17:48.650,"You don’t believe that, do you?"
00:17:48.734,00:17:53.322,"Oh, come on, Dad! That is so crazy and so adorable."
00:17:54.657,00:17:56.826,That woman loves you.
00:17:58.369,00:18:00.162,"Well, I didn’t say I wasn’t lovable."
00:18:01.956,00:18:05.667,It’s not every wife that would spend the money to fly a family to Hawaii.
00:18:05.751,00:18:09.005,Okay. Where does everybody think Gloria’s money comes from?
00:18:13.009,00:18:17.095,"So, what kind of business did you have in Japan?"
00:18:17.179,00:18:20.682,You didn’t go to Osaka November 2003 to attend an electronics trade show?
00:18:20.766,00:18:22.267,I was four.
00:18:22.351,00:18:25.270,"Enough. Why don’t you question the other people on the gate, huh?"
00:18:25.354,00:18:27.314,Did you see the old lady with the cane?
00:18:27.398,00:18:30.275,What if she has a ceramic knife in there that can go through the metal detector?
00:18:30.359,00:18:33.278,And yet you waste your time harassing a little kid.
00:18:37.533,00:18:39.451,"Yeah, I’m Colombian."
00:18:39.535,00:18:41.662,Have you ever been to Japan?
00:18:46.125,00:18:48.126,will begin in the next few minutes.
00:18:48.210,00:18:50.712,"Luke, please stop spinning."
00:18:50.796,00:18:53.215,Now make the airport stop spinning.
00:18:57.887,00:18:59.805,Hi!
00:18:59.889,00:19:01.807,I am so sorry.
00:19:01.891,00:19:03.976,It wasn’t your fault.
00:19:08.481,00:19:13.027,"And once I spent a week in Cancún, which, by the way, did not live up to the hype."
00:19:15.821,00:19:18.156,Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on?
00:19:18.240,00:19:20.158,"We’re almost done here, sir."
00:19:20.242,00:19:23.328,- So you and your son are traveling together? - Yes.
00:19:27.083,00:19:31.503,"Well, because he’s traveling back home with his family."
00:19:31.587,00:19:33.588,What?
00:19:33.672,00:19:35.424,They’re only staying for six days.
00:19:35.508,00:19:38.093,The rest of the time it’s only you and me.
00:19:38.177,00:19:45.434,"Mm-hmm. I wanted to spend some time alone with my husband– drink cocktails by the pool, sleep in."
00:19:46.936,00:19:49.855,I could not love you any more than I do right now.
00:20:02.410,00:20:04.286,"It’s to the left. Oh, gorgeous!"
00:20:04.370,00:20:06.038,"Oh, thank you. It’s vintage."
00:20:06.122,00:20:07.581,You don’t know that.
00:20:07.665,00:20:10.751,"Hey, there’s another hottie for you at 5:00."
00:20:10.835,00:20:12.753,I think he’s an artist.
00:20:12.837,00:20:14.755,It’s whale watching.
00:20:14.839,00:20:17.716,Whale washing.
00:20:17.800,00:20:19.801,Washing. That’s close enough.
00:20:19.885,00:20:22.804,"Have a good flight, sir."
00:20:22.888,00:20:25.098,"She hasn’t been drinking, has she?"
00:20:25.182,00:20:28.060,"She’s– She’s hilarious. Okay, let’s do bride of Frankenstein."
00:20:30.479,00:20:32.648,"It’s so, so good."
00:00:05.923,00:00:07.590,The doggy was blocking her face.
00:00:10.093,00:00:14.180,There she is– the prettiest white woman on Maui. Milady.
00:00:14.264,00:00:17.934,"Actually, Claire and I were supposed to go to Hawaii for our honeymoon."
00:00:20.771,00:00:22.981,I got pregnant with Haley.
00:00:23.065,00:00:24.983,We didn’t even have a proper wedding.
00:00:25.067,00:00:27.443,We just went down to the courthouse on a Tuesday.
00:00:27.527,00:00:31.447,The judge sentenced me to life with no chance of parole.
00:00:38.872,00:00:40.790,"Being romantic. God, you’re solid."
00:00:40.874,00:00:42.959,"Sweetie, put me down. Go on. Okay."
00:00:43.043,00:00:45.879,"Honey, come on. Let’s turn this vacation into a honeymoon."
00:00:45.963,00:00:47.964,"Sweet pea, I’m a mom traveling with my kids."
00:00:48.048,00:00:51.635,"For me, this is not a vacation. It’s a business trip. Let’s go."
00:00:53.637,00:00:55.096,Ah! Wow!
00:01:01.728,00:01:03.689,"What do you think, Manny?"
00:01:05.649,00:01:07.734,I’m home.
00:01:27.087,00:01:30.965,"Don’t you want to keep our room neat? You know, in case we entertain."
00:01:31.049,00:01:32.967,Who would we entertain?
00:01:33.051,00:01:35.178,I noticed some lovely tweens down by the kids’ club.
00:01:35.262,00:01:37.430,Maybe we can find a nice spot near them by the pool...
00:01:37.514,00:01:39.599,and send over a couple of virgin mai tais.
00:01:39.683,00:01:42.311,They may be interested in two sophisticated men like us.
00:01:44.521,00:01:46.898,I am a bathroom martian!
00:01:46.982,00:01:49.025,"Beep, boop, boop."
00:01:49.109,00:01:52.028,I am from the nebula of the Great Toilet.
00:01:52.112,00:01:54.614,"Beep, boop. Beep, boop, bop."
00:01:57.534,00:01:59.452,"Instead of salad, I want fries."
00:01:59.536,00:02:01.704,"Instead of fruit, I want chili fries."
00:02:01.788,00:02:05.583,"Haley, sweetie, put the phone down and put on some sunscreen. Please?"
00:02:05.667,00:02:08.461,"We have got to stay on these kids all day, or else they’re gonna burn."
00:02:08.545,00:02:15.969,"Totally. They put on the littlest bit of sunscreen in the morning, they think it’s got them covered for the– Are you watching Gloria in my sunglasses?"
00:02:16.053,00:02:18.638,"Is she moving in slow motion, or is my brain doing that?"
00:02:18.722,00:02:21.057,"Phil, this is important."
00:02:21.141,00:02:24.269,"Hey, everybody. We’re on our way to see the world’s largest banyan tree."
00:02:24.353,00:02:25.979,Does anybody want to come?
00:02:26.063,00:02:31.985,"Now, why in the hell would anyone want to leave paradise, take a hot bus ride to see a tree?"
00:02:36.740,00:02:40.493,We-We both like to immerse ourselves in the culture and really get to know the locals.
00:02:40.577,00:02:42.120,We’ve made friends all over the world.
00:02:48.001,00:02:49.503,all of our old clothes.
00:02:50.670,00:02:56.051,"He was a very nice man when we met him, but based on his recent letters, I have a small fear he’s become a warlord."
00:02:58.637,00:03:01.848,Hey. I’m gonna go to the gym to work out a little bit. You want to come with me?
00:03:01.932,00:03:06.019,I just ordered an extra-long straw to avoid accidentally doing a sit-up.
00:03:09.106,00:03:11.024,My brother.
00:03:11.108,00:03:14.319,"What’s up, jackass? Happy birthday, you dumb son of a bitch."
00:03:14.403,00:03:15.945,"Birthday’s tomorrow, moron!"
00:03:16.029,00:03:17.739,I never understood this relationship.
00:03:17.823,00:03:20.742,"- So, 63, right? - Hey, you can count!"
00:03:20.826,00:03:23.578,You know Dad was 63 when he died.
00:03:26.164,00:03:28.499,"Ah, don’t worry. He never took care of himself."
00:03:37.092,00:03:41.054,"So, I was thinking we book a couples’ massage."
00:03:41.138,00:03:43.222,Mm-hmm.
00:03:50.981,00:03:53.274,"Thanks, sweetie. Haley, come on. Off the phone."
00:04:01.074,00:04:02.742,"Oh, my God! Oh!"
00:04:02.826,00:04:05.411,"Phil, what are you thinking?"
00:04:05.495,00:04:07.580,That is an expensive cell phone.
00:04:11.543,00:04:13.628,"In nature, fathers are known to eat their young."
00:04:13.712,00:04:16.172,Is it because they’re delicious? No.
00:04:16.256,00:04:23.472,"It’s because they want to give their female– bear, giraffe, what have you– the honeymoon they never had."
00:04:24.848,00:04:30.103,"Just to be clear, I’m not condoning eating your kids, but I sure as heck know why giraffes do it."
00:04:31.229,00:04:32.772,What?
00:04:40.030,00:04:42.198,"- Come on, sleepy! - Ay, Jay!"
00:04:42.282,00:04:45.451,"Come on, honey! Get out of bed! I just booked us on an outrigger."
00:04:45.535,00:04:48.246,But it is your birthday. You don’t want to sleep in? Come here.
00:04:48.330,00:04:50.623,"No, no, I just came from the gym. Guess how much I benched."
00:04:50.707,00:04:53.126,- I don’t know. 500 pounds? - 500 pounds?
00:04:59.174,00:05:01.217,I decided to get in better shape quick.
00:05:09.809,00:05:12.228,Manny is the worst roommate ever.
00:05:13.980,00:05:15.898,"Sweetie, it’s only for a few more days."
00:05:15.982,00:05:17.900,Last night we had a fire drill.
00:05:17.984,00:05:19.986,Not the hotel. Just us.
00:05:20.070,00:05:21.737,"Hi, guys. Hey."
00:05:21.821,00:05:23.448,Hey!
00:05:23.532,00:05:26.159,"So, what’s today’s big adventure?"
00:05:28.245,00:05:33.583,"Well, it is a big one– the lavender ranch, where they grow 45 different varieties of lavender."
00:05:38.088,00:05:40.339,"Oh. Well, more lavender for us."
00:05:47.097,00:05:51.267,"But it’s one of the things he loves most about me, and I can’t tell him the truth now."
00:05:51.351,00:05:55.188,It would be like Lewis telling Clark that he didn’t like to walk.
00:05:55.272,00:05:59.484,Side note: We’re very good friends with a couple named Lewis and Clark.
00:05:59.568,00:06:03.697,"Clark bought a big, sparkly belt in New Orleans that he calls his Louisiana Purchase."
00:06:04.781,00:06:07.158,"Mom, Haley keeps stealing my iPod."
00:06:07.242,00:06:10.536,All my music is on my phone. What else am I supposed to do?
00:06:14.332,00:06:17.710,"Aloha. Hi. Sorry, folks. This pool is for adults only."
00:06:21.798,00:06:24.342,Wait! Where are you guys going?
00:06:26.469,00:06:28.638,What just happened?
00:06:30.473,00:06:34.101,"Ooh, so we can drink lavender tea while eating lavender scones."
00:06:34.185,00:06:39.815,"Oh, neat! So, is this an all-day thing or– Oh, no. I know what you’re thinking, Cam."
00:06:39.899,00:06:42.818,Don’t worry. We’ll still have time for the whaling village.
00:06:42.902,00:06:47.490,Oh. Good. So– Okay.
00:06:49.159,00:06:51.244,- I can’t. - What?
00:06:59.836,00:07:06.592,But... the lavender ranch– It’s– It’s something two men are meant to do together.
00:07:14.517,00:07:16.394,"Think about what you’re missing, Cam."
00:07:16.478,00:07:18.396,It’s an entire ranch full of lavender.
00:07:18.480,00:07:21.441,You’re not making the compelling case you think you are!
00:07:26.446,00:07:27.947,"Hey, you little monkey!"
00:07:28.031,00:07:30.908,No standing around! There you go!
00:07:30.992,00:07:33.244,Here goes another one! There you go!
00:07:33.328,00:07:36.038,Here comes another one! There you go!
00:07:37.374,00:07:39.417,I thought you were one of ours!
00:07:39.501,00:07:41.419,"Hey, Jay! Be careful!"
00:07:41.503,00:07:43.671,You’re gonna hurt somebody– like you!
00:07:43.755,00:07:46.924,- Don’t get too comfortable. I reserved us a tennis court. - Yay.
00:07:47.008,00:07:50.219,I thought that one of the advantages of marrying an older guy...
00:07:50.303,00:07:52.597,was that I was going to be able to relax.
00:07:52.681,00:07:59.353,But all this swimming and running and rowing– It’s just like how some of my relatives got into this country.
00:08:01.106,00:08:03.691,"You look prettier now than the day we got married. Oh, honey."
00:08:06.152,00:08:09.196,I did push-ups in the bathroom.
00:08:12.075,00:08:13.993,I’ve always been funny.
00:08:22.836,00:08:26.088,Phil and Claire Dunphy?
00:08:26.172,00:08:29.008,"Yes, Haley, honey? What is it?"
00:08:29.092,00:08:32.678,I’m gonna go get some shaved ice at the hotel next door with some kids.
00:08:32.762,00:08:35.723,- What kids? - Just some kids I met at the pool.
00:08:35.807,00:08:38.851,"Okay. Um– I should go with her and– Claire, no."
00:08:38.935,00:08:41.103,You have to learn to let go.
00:08:41.187,00:08:44.857,Turning a family vacation into a honeymoon takes commitment.
00:08:44.941,00:08:49.403,You can do it. Eye of the tiger.
00:08:51.114,00:08:52.990,I should at least meet them. I– No.
00:08:53.074,00:08:57.787,That is not eye of the tiger.
00:09:02.041,00:09:06.045,"All right, Haley, honey, go and have fun, but don’t get in anybody’s car..."
00:09:06.129,00:09:09.256,"and be back in time for your grandfather’s birthday dinner, okay?"
00:09:09.340,00:09:10.633,Thank you!
00:09:10.717,00:09:12.635,"Bye, honey!"
00:09:12.719,00:09:15.554,"Oh, God."
00:09:15.638,00:09:18.974,That feels weird and good all at once.
00:09:19.058,00:09:21.978,I know. I was leaning up against that nozzle a minute ago.
00:09:25.482,00:09:28.275,"- Hey. - Hey, you’re back. How was it?"
00:09:28.359,00:09:31.821,"Ah! Cameron, it was the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life."
00:09:40.079,00:09:43.124,"- And we bonded, because he too likes adventure. - Did that really happen?"
00:09:45.335,00:09:47.712,trying to get back at you for bailing on me.
00:09:47.796,00:09:50.798,"I’m sorry. If it means anything, we’ve been relaxing here doing nothing."
00:09:50.882,00:09:55.302,"No, I can’t– I just don’t– I don’t find relaxing that relaxing."
00:09:55.386,00:09:56.929,I understand. You are who you are.
00:09:57.013,00:09:58.597,Leilani.
00:09:58.681,00:10:00.599,You know what? I think it’s because of my parents.
00:10:00.683,00:10:03.477,It always is. Kipu!
00:10:03.561,00:10:06.897,"I mean, vacation with my mom and dad was them sitting around like statues..."
00:10:06.981,00:10:13.612,"when, you know, the only thing that me and Claire could do for excitement was– Oh. Was sit around and listen to my skin sizzle."
00:10:13.696,00:10:16.323,You poor thing. Sue?
00:10:16.407,00:10:20.453,"So, that’s, like– That’s why, when I’m on vacation, I want to go out and meet the locals."
00:10:20.537,00:10:22.747,"I want to immerse myself in the culture, you know?"
00:10:25.208,00:10:27.209,"Sweet Lady Gaga, that is good."
00:10:30.547,00:10:32.882,"Oh, thank you."
00:10:36.553,00:10:37.720,Happiness.
00:10:42.475,00:10:47.062,"I’m curious. Is there any sand left on the beach, or did you bring it all up to our bathroom?"
00:10:49.232,00:10:51.192,And now you’re sitting on my linen jacket.
00:10:51.276,00:10:53.194,I guess I can’t have nice things.
00:10:53.278,00:10:56.489,Oh. I’m sorry. I didn’t know it was there.
00:10:56.573,00:10:58.574,Oh!
00:10:58.658,00:11:01.827,I’m wearing that tonight!
00:11:01.911,00:11:04.330,Ooh!
00:11:04.414,00:11:06.749,I want you out! This isn’t working!
00:11:10.837,00:11:13.005,What don’t you understand about out?
00:11:13.089,00:11:15.716,Fine. I’ll just move in with my sisters.
00:11:15.800,00:11:18.135,"Ooh, hoo!"
00:11:18.219,00:11:20.846,"Oh, no! Who will pee all over the bathroom floor?"
00:11:25.977,00:11:27.520,What’d you do today?
00:11:27.604,00:11:29.980,You did?
00:11:30.064,00:11:32.399,I haven’t napped in years.
00:11:32.483,00:11:36.028,Mm-hmm. Good and weird. Kinda like that one nozzle in the infinity pool.
00:11:39.866,00:11:42.034,"Is it me, or is Lily more relaxed here?"
00:11:42.118,00:11:45.246,"She is. I think it’s because she’s really picking up on our energy, you know?"
00:11:45.330,00:11:47.414,"It’s like, if we’re tense, she’s gonna be tense."
00:11:47.498,00:11:49.500,And I think we need to bring this new energy home.
00:11:49.584,00:11:53.796,It’s gonna make us better parents– What? What happened?
00:11:53.880,00:11:56.590,You didn’t bring her out!
00:11:59.552,00:12:01.470,Come on. Let me paint you.
00:12:01.554,00:12:04.223,"Oh, sweetie. That is so creepy."
00:12:04.307,00:12:07.601,Where is everyone?
00:12:07.685,00:12:11.438,Okay. Let me just say what everyone’s thinking.
00:12:11.522,00:12:16.902,"My jacket’s a mess. It wouldn’t be, but someone used the iron to make grilled cheese."
00:12:16.986,00:12:21.407,"I had bread, I had cheese and I had an iron. What was I supposed to do?"
00:12:21.491,00:12:23.784,"Kids, kids. We don’t care."
00:12:23.868,00:12:25.828,"¡Hola, hola!"
00:12:25.912,00:12:29.248,Hey.
00:12:29.332,00:12:32.126,"- He’s not with you? - No, he came down long time ago."
00:12:34.212,00:12:37.674,"Yeah, he’s probably in the ocean trying to pull a tugboat with his teeth."
00:12:38.967,00:12:41.135,"Well, look who decided to join us."
00:12:51.020,00:12:58.194,I-I knew I never should have let her– Guarantee our bathroom is still messier.
00:13:05.034,00:13:07.411,Where– I don’t know! I’m taking the stairs!
00:13:07.495,00:13:09.789,"Lily, we’re coming for you!"
00:13:14.919,00:13:17.004,"Hey, you. Where you headed?"
00:13:19.549,00:13:21.675,to let Haley go next door with complete strangers?
00:13:21.759,00:13:23.677,And you were totally on board. Yeah.
00:13:25.722,00:13:28.557,But she’s just a kid. Who would serve her?
00:13:28.641,00:13:33.854,"On a silver platter. You convinced me to relax and let go, and now this happens."
00:13:36.524,00:13:38.442,about wanting a little time for ourselves.
00:13:38.526,00:13:41.946,"Sweetie, this isn’t a honeymoon. We have kids. You have got to let this go."
00:13:42.030,00:13:44.823,"From now on, I am not losing sight of them for two seconds."
00:13:44.907,00:13:46.409,Nothing gets past me.
00:13:48.202,00:13:50.371,Hey.
00:13:50.455,00:13:52.373,I’m sorry. I have to deal with Haley.
00:13:52.457,00:13:54.750,"No. You know what, sweetie? I will deal with Haley."
00:14:00.715,00:14:03.134,"Lily, where you going, huh?"
00:14:07.472,00:14:09.390,"Oh, my God."
00:14:09.474,00:14:12.101,"Oh, my God. Wow. What were you thinking?"
00:14:12.185,00:14:15.938,"One of the kids had an I.D., and she bought some drinks."
00:14:16.022,00:14:20.359,"I tried one, and then another one. It was stupid."
00:14:20.443,00:14:26.281,"Yes. Yes, it was stupid, but you are really lucky that this did not end as badly as it could have."
00:14:26.365,00:14:29.034,This is why we always say to you...
00:14:29.118,00:14:31.370,"when you drink, you make bad decisions."
00:14:44.175,00:14:46.135,Thanks for not yelling at me.
00:14:46.219,00:14:49.471,"Oh, honey. That would just be cruel."
00:14:49.555,00:14:51.473,I’ll wait till you feel better to yell.
00:14:56.687,00:14:59.273,Does this happen every time you drink?
00:15:01.067,00:15:03.068,Yes.
00:15:03.152,00:15:05.154,"Yes, it does."
00:15:06.864,00:15:09.033,Jay?
00:15:09.117,00:15:11.702,Over here.
00:15:11.786,00:15:15.914,Hey. Hey! What are you doing?
00:15:18.918,00:15:22.171,"Oh. Well, don’t you worry. We’re gonna get you out of here."
00:15:22.255,00:15:27.843,"Grab on. Yeah, you know, Phil, this might not be the best– No, no, no, no, no. I’m just gonna rock you– like a hurricane."
00:15:33.015,00:15:34.933,"And now– Oh, wow!"
00:15:35.017,00:15:38.104,There’s spasming. Don’t move. Don’t move.
00:15:51.367,00:15:53.535,It’s really been a vacation of a lifetime.
00:16:24.233,00:16:26.568,"Anyone! Anyone, help! Alert security!"
00:16:26.652,00:16:29.238,Seal off the island!
00:16:29.322,00:16:31.573,This– This way! This way!
00:16:32.950,00:16:35.160,Lily!
00:16:37.580,00:16:40.207,Lily. We were so worried. We just got distracted.
00:16:40.291,00:16:42.209,"Oh, we’re idiots."
00:16:42.293,00:16:44.461,I used to lose Manny all the time.
00:16:44.545,00:16:47.757,Now I lost your father. These things happen.
00:16:48.966,00:16:50.593,"She’s right, you know."
00:16:54.180,00:16:56.098,Hmm?
00:16:57.600,00:17:00.602,"We say we’ll make time, but life gets in the way."
00:17:00.686,00:17:04.523,"I mean, I know we’re parents, but can’t we be lovers too?"
00:17:04.607,00:17:06.859,This may be my worst birthday ever.
00:17:06.943,00:17:08.402,There you are!
00:17:09.987,00:17:11.947,He was stuck in a hammock. It was actually really funny.
00:17:12.031,00:17:14.783,"I was on top of him for, like, 20 minutes."
00:17:18.496,00:17:19.997,My back seized up.
00:17:20.081,00:17:23.041,"Yeah, because you overdid it after that phone call about your father."
00:17:23.125,00:17:25.586,I can’t believe I’m as old as he was.
00:17:31.050,00:17:34.387,You’d have liked him– my old man.
00:17:35.596,00:17:37.556,And he’d have loved you.
00:17:40.142,00:17:42.561,"Mmm, I know the type."
00:17:42.645,00:17:45.355,And we had a lot of fun.
00:17:45.439,00:17:47.691,But I’ll tell you something.
00:17:47.775,00:17:51.403,Our family vacations were nothing like this here.
00:17:51.487,00:17:54.740,"One week a year in a rented cottage on Lake Erie, spiders this big."
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.207,"Well, if you keep going like this, maybe you can tell him yourself."
00:18:03.291,00:18:06.460,"Or I can tell him, because you’re about to kill me, Jay."
00:18:06.544,00:18:10.130,"My legs, my arms, my back– everything is sore."
00:18:14.010,00:18:17.012,"When I sit down, I can still get up. Eh."
00:18:17.096,00:18:19.932,"Hey, uh– Okay, come on."
00:18:20.016,00:18:23.810,Come here. Come here.
00:18:23.894,00:18:26.647,The rest of the trip went better. Haley’s room stopped spinning.
00:18:26.731,00:18:31.443,"And a monkey– Oh, honey!"
00:18:31.527,00:18:33.904,Do you want some eggs Benedict? So creamy!
00:18:46.208,00:18:48.252,And Mitch and Cam managed to do some sightseeing...
00:18:48.336,00:18:52.464,at a working banana plantation– where they promptly lost Lily again.
00:18:52.548,00:18:54.466,Why did you dress her in jungle prints?
00:18:54.550,00:18:56.093,Because I thought it would be cute!
00:18:56.177,00:19:00.055,She’s gonna think she’s back in Vietnam!
00:19:07.563,00:19:10.816,I think I just expected a little too much from this vacation.
00:19:13.652,00:19:16.321,"Like you said, the thrill is gone."
00:19:16.405,00:19:19.366,I never said that.
00:19:19.450,00:19:23.036,But wait. Put a few seconds back on the clock.
00:19:26.415,00:19:28.041,"Oh, my God."
00:19:28.125,00:19:30.419,I figured out why we couldn’t have a honeymoon.
00:19:30.503,00:19:33.046,Because we never had a wedding.
00:19:42.807,00:19:45.726,Looks like I finally get to walk you down the aisle. Daddy!
00:19:47.812,00:19:50.230,Okay. I’ll do that.
00:19:50.314,00:19:53.400,We’re here today to celebrate the renewing of the marriage vows...
00:19:55.069,00:19:59.406,On this day they’ve chosen to reaffirm their love for each other.
00:19:59.490,00:20:02.409,You may kiss your bride.
00:20:02.493,00:20:07.080,"I present to you, still as husband and wife, Mr. and Mrs. Dunphy."
00:20:42.158,00:20:44.284,Thank for you choosing Continental Airlines.
00:20:44.368,00:20:46.036,Thank you.
00:20:53.043,00:20:56.630,That was a little fast.
00:20:56.714,00:20:59.091,Okay.
00:20:59.175,00:21:01.218,Any idea of who you would remarry?
00:21:03.637,00:21:05.847,She’s very organized. The kids love her.
00:21:13.606,00:21:19.028,"Just so you know, if something were to happen to me, I– Something’s gonna happen to you, all right."
00:00:04.296,00:00:06.714,"- Oh, hey, honey. Have a great time at the game. - Thanks."
00:00:09.259,00:00:20.603,"Ordinarily, I’m a rule follower, but when someone tells me I can’t bring my own snacks into their stadium, It’s a free country, right?"
00:00:33.533,00:00:35.827,We only have the photographer for an hour.
00:00:35.911,00:00:39.581,"Okay? And, sweetie, did you have a chance to try on the white pants I put in your closet?"
00:00:39.665,00:00:41.624,"Oh, what do they look like?"
00:00:41.708,00:00:44.752,Is there really a more clear way to describe white pants?
00:00:44.836,00:00:50.925,"Sweetie, if they don’t fit you, you’re going to be the only one not wearing white, and then you’re gonna stand out like Where’s Waldo?"
00:00:53.011,00:00:54.971,He’s super hard to find. That’s the challenge.
00:00:55.055,00:00:57.891,"This portrait is incredibly important to me. Also, his name is just Waldo."
00:00:57.975,00:01:00.393,I spent weeks trying to find a time that works for everybody...
00:01:00.477,00:01:02.395,and finding the right photographer.
00:01:02.479,00:01:05.440,"So if you could just promise me that you’ll cooperate, okay?"
00:01:07.526,00:01:10.278,This is amazing that you’re doing this.
00:01:10.362,00:01:12.280,You’re wonderful.
00:01:12.364,00:01:14.949,"Get in here– Oh, no can do."
00:01:15.033,00:01:17.493,- I love you. - Bye.
00:01:19.913,00:01:21.831,Where’s my good underwear?
00:01:21.915,00:01:27.128,"The question is, why isn’t all your underwear good, Jay? You make a nice living."
00:01:27.212,00:01:30.089,The new maid keeps mixing up my underwear with Manny’s.
00:01:30.173,00:01:32.634,Put on the first thing I grabbed. It was like a crotch tourniquet.
00:01:32.718,00:01:34.594,You gotta talk to her.
00:01:39.975,00:01:43.102,that you put all of us in the same mixing pot?
00:01:43.186,00:01:47.482,Sorry. Please apologize to her when you tell her not to put my underwear– I can’t talk to her!
00:01:48.984,00:01:50.109,"Hey, guys."
00:01:52.863,00:01:55.490,Luke suddenly remembered a school project due tomorrow.
00:01:55.574,00:01:57.617,"Oh, that’s tough. But it’s a good lesson for the kid."
00:01:57.701,00:01:59.953,"You know, you make a commitment, you gotta follow through."
00:02:00.037,00:02:02.538,Yeah.
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.582,He has to interview somebody who lived through the 1960s.
00:02:04.666,00:02:07.210,"Oh, no."
00:02:07.294,00:02:09.963,Hello.
00:02:10.047,00:02:13.883,"Yeah, Luke. Oh, sure. I remember what I said."
00:02:18.555,00:02:21.015,"Yay. Manny, ¡vamos!"
00:02:21.099,00:02:22.600,I’m still getting dressed.
00:02:25.604,00:02:27.272,My underwear won’t stay up.
00:02:44.164,00:02:47.542,"Oh, so delicious. Yes."
00:02:47.626,00:02:50.461,"Hey, you’re okay with me not going with you today, right?"
00:02:50.545,00:02:54.007,I have been hired to sing at a wedding this weekend.
00:02:54.091,00:03:00.013,I was plucked from obscurity after a particularly stirring karaoke performance.
00:03:00.097,00:03:02.391,So I guess you could say I’m a professional singer now.
00:03:12.317,00:03:14.235,They’re also given paychecks.
00:03:14.319,00:03:18.781,"And I’m really bad at small talk, so– I get it. It’s not a problem."
00:03:18.865,00:03:20.950,Are you sure? ’Cause you’ve been quiet all morning.
00:03:21.034,00:03:23.786,It’s because I’m resting my instrument.
00:03:34.339,00:03:36.215,Kobe!
00:03:36.299,00:03:38.718,What can I do for you?
00:03:38.802,00:03:42.805,Do you like being a basketball player?
00:03:42.889,00:03:44.557,Serious?
00:03:44.641,00:03:47.101,I choked. I didn’t think you’d look up here at me.
00:03:47.185,00:03:51.064,- Little preparation next time. It’s a mental game. - Duly noted.
00:04:05.370,00:04:07.163,It’s gonna ruin our whole family portrait.
00:04:07.247,00:04:09.624,"Okay, here’s my idea. I’m really excited about it."
00:04:09.708,00:04:14.587,"The whole extended family, all dressed in white, in a single-file line down the staircase."
00:04:14.671,00:04:17.548,"Oh, like a line on the highway."
00:04:17.632,00:04:20.510,"Or, uh, a ski jump."
00:04:20.594,00:04:22.804,Why– Why would I want a ski jump?
00:04:22.888,00:04:26.057,"My idea was to have the whole family in a giant bed, like in Willy Wonka."
00:04:26.141,00:04:28.309,"Yeah, but that’s ridiculous."
00:04:28.393,00:04:32.105,Ridiculicious.
00:04:32.189,00:04:35.149,I don’t see anything.
00:04:35.233,00:04:37.486,No. You’re... not.
00:04:39.738,00:04:41.864,Your father was supposed to fix that step.
00:04:41.948,00:04:46.619,"Mom, you’re obsessing over the tiniest little thing– So you do see it, yeah."
00:04:46.703,00:04:48.996,What is the big deal about this one picture?
00:04:53.376,00:04:57.505,"All right, when you’re a mom, everything goes by so quickly."
00:05:08.808,00:05:11.811,I just wanna freeze this moment as it is right now.
00:05:11.895,00:05:14.355,You know?
00:05:14.439,00:05:20.903,"I know I don’t show it, but this family’s still the most important thing– Screw it. I’m gonna fix the bastard."
00:05:20.987,00:05:23.072,"I mean, seriously, how hard can it be?"
00:05:23.156,00:05:25.491,"If your father can do it, I can do it. Right?"
00:05:25.575,00:05:28.578,All right. I just need to...
00:05:30.038,00:05:35.168,"lift– Oh, now I see it."
00:05:35.252,00:05:37.336,Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
00:05:41.883,00:05:44.051,These seats are amazing.
00:05:44.135,00:05:46.762,Why you have candy coming out of your pocket?
00:05:46.846,00:05:49.640,Huh? I brought my own snacks.
00:05:51.977,00:05:54.604,Plus I get a little rush from the danger. Be cool. Be cool.
00:05:54.688,00:05:58.149,What?
00:05:59.150,00:06:02.778,I never felt more alive. Whoo!
00:06:07.117,00:06:09.869,"I’m gonna call your dad, and he’s gonna tell me how to fix this."
00:06:09.953,00:06:12.121,"- Oh, my God! It’s Dad. - Where?"
00:06:12.205,00:06:15.208,"Right there, behind Kobe."
00:06:15.292,00:06:17.585,"Quick. Quick, tell me something to say that will freak him out."
00:06:17.669,00:06:20.546,Tell him I’m pregnant.
00:06:30.640,00:06:33.851,"Well, that was pretty funny."
00:06:41.026,00:06:43.069,"Oh, my God!"
00:06:43.153,00:06:45.905,"Oh, my God."
00:06:46.823,00:06:49.659,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:06:53.163,00:06:55.165,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:06:56.166,00:06:58.834,Oh. Oh.
00:06:58.918,00:07:01.963,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:07:02.047,00:07:03.965,"Oh, my God. Oh."
00:07:05.634,00:07:07.802,It’s much better. Excuse me. Sorry.
00:07:07.886,00:07:10.137,I think that’s her cousin.
00:07:10.221,00:07:14.183,There is a pigeon in our house. What do I do? What do I do? Who is this?
00:07:16.770,00:07:21.357,"You know I grew up around many animals. One time, a rooster attacked me, and my mom wrung its neck, and we had it for dinner."
00:07:21.441,00:07:24.110,Great time for an anecdote. Help me.
00:07:24.194,00:07:26.696,It’s more afraid of you than you are of it.
00:07:26.780,00:07:29.073,Pigeons aren’t scared of anything. They stand on electrical wires.
00:07:35.580,00:07:39.375,"As long as I don’t what? Cam? As long as I don’t– Oh, God!"
00:07:43.797,00:07:48.426,Wouldn’t it be embarrassing if the camera was on us and then the crowd started– We’re related.
00:07:48.510,00:07:50.469,Touch me and there will be blood.
00:07:53.932,00:07:56.017,Not us.
00:08:02.232,00:08:06.903,"This is my wife’s dad’s second wife. So legally okay, but still weird."
00:08:15.620,00:08:19.999,Oh.
00:08:26.673,00:08:29.258,Thank God for caller I.D. so you don’t have to talk to your wife.
00:08:37.100,00:08:40.687,"Dad, Mom saw you on TV. You’re dead."
00:08:43.106,00:08:45.941,Here’s the thing. The kiss cam is only supposed to be...
00:08:46.025,00:08:48.361,for the enjoyment of the people at the game.
00:08:48.445,00:08:50.738,They never show that on TV.
00:08:53.950,00:08:56.243,should be their own business.
00:08:56.327,00:09:04.126,"So in ’66, I worked in my grandfather’s office supply business– your ink, your staples, your legal pads."
00:09:04.210,00:09:07.755,- Am I going too fast for you? - I fell asleep for a second.
00:09:10.633,00:09:13.386,"Well, one summer, I swept up hair at my other grandfather’s barbershop."
00:09:13.470,00:09:15.596,You’re killing me.
00:09:19.517,00:09:23.229,Artie Beckwith? He couldn’t walk two feet without complaining.
00:09:23.313,00:09:26.607,He marched on Washington?
00:09:26.691,00:09:30.194,- With Martin Luther King Jr. - Martin Luther King?
00:09:30.278,00:09:33.531,- Guess who cut his hair. - What?
00:09:33.615,00:09:36.158,Do you know who cut Martin Luther King Jr.’s hair?
00:09:57.138,00:09:59.390,"Okay, you know what, Lily? I am a man."
00:10:21.371,00:10:23.873,Oh! Oh!
00:12:16.152,00:12:19.363,"Then one day, Wilt Chamberlain shows up."
00:12:32.335,00:12:35.296,Then I guess I gotta fight your dad.
00:12:40.677,00:12:43.763,Luke says Grandpa wants to fight you.
00:12:53.231,00:12:56.150,Why does everything have to suck?
00:12:56.234,00:12:59.236,Let’s just do the picture another day. I think I’m getting a pimple.
00:12:59.320,00:13:02.115,No. Do you know how long it took me to book this photographer?
00:13:06.160,00:13:09.663,Yeah. That’s a classic old-person spot for a portrait.
00:13:09.747,00:13:12.374,"Yeah, if I’d ever bothered to paint that hideous wall."
00:13:12.458,00:13:23.636,"Claire is a perfectionist, which sometimes is a good thing, Sometimes it’s a bad thing, like when everyone else sees something beautiful..."
00:13:23.720,00:13:27.306,and all she sees is the teeny-tiny flaw.
00:13:30.977,00:13:32.978,No.
00:13:33.062,00:13:35.648,Hi. My house is a disaster.
00:13:37.900,00:13:41.528,"Yeah, that’s– that’s not gonna work."
00:13:41.612,00:13:51.956,"So– Maybe one more layer. And tight, really tight."
00:13:52.040,00:13:54.333,"Dad, can you call them again?"
00:13:54.417,00:13:56.335,They’re on their way. Game went into overtime.
00:14:02.091,00:14:05.010,"You know, honey, I think you’re getting a little too uptight about this."
00:14:07.930,00:14:11.767,What’d you do to him? He’s turning blue.
00:14:11.851,00:14:14.353,"- We’re home! - Oh, thank God."
00:14:18.691,00:14:21.735,"I know you’re mad at me, and I know this foam finger can’t make up for everything."
00:14:21.819,00:14:24.363,"Honey, you just go change, and we’ll talk about what you did later."
00:14:24.447,00:14:26.740,"Hey, thank you so much for those tickets."
00:14:31.454,00:14:35.207,Oh! I should– I should come by and kiss that step– fix that step.
00:14:40.505,00:14:42.172,were sent to us by my mom.
00:14:42.256,00:14:49.972,"Okay, okay, okay. So while I’m fighting off that filthy creature, I actually stop and say, Oh, you know what, here’s the opportunity I’ve always been looking for to destroy our kitschiest objects."
00:14:50.056,00:14:51.682,"Kitschiest? Oh, she’s gonna love that."
00:14:54.644,00:14:57.229,Okay. So you are angry.
00:14:57.313,00:14:59.398,You’re terrified of small talk and birds.
00:14:59.482,00:15:01.984,You’re just lucky that pigeon didn’t want to chat you up about the weather.
00:15:02.068,00:15:03.611,"Hello, Jay."
00:15:04.987,00:15:07.573,"Oh, God. Oh, you look like the guy from Dance Fever."
00:15:12.370,00:15:15.497,That’s why I wanted you to try those on earlier. Turn around.
00:15:15.581,00:15:17.624,The picture can’t happen today. My pimple’s getting worse.
00:15:22.171,00:15:26.676,It’s all anybody’s gonna see.
00:15:30.429,00:15:32.765,What? Why would I look at her dress? I love you.
00:15:32.849,00:15:34.975,"Uh, Mrs. Dunphy, the sun is setting."
00:15:35.059,00:15:37.644,"Okay. Yeah, this is happening. Everybody, come on. Let’s go."
00:15:37.728,00:15:40.939,Be careful. I stained some furniture out there this afternoon.
00:15:43.526,00:15:45.778,Maybe the neighbors on either side are having a paintball fight.
00:15:49.240,00:15:51.158,Don’t touch it. It’s wet.
00:15:51.242,00:15:53.452,"Put that down, sweetheart."
00:15:53.536,00:15:56.413,"Okay. Okay, we got it. Now we’re gonna go out here."
00:15:56.497,00:15:59.041,"Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?"
00:15:59.125,00:16:01.043,How do– How do you turn the sprinklers off?
00:16:01.127,00:16:05.714,"¡Ay! Of course! Because I’m Latina, I’m supposed to know everything about gardening and sprinklers!"
00:16:05.798,00:16:08.050,You were here when they installed it.
00:16:08.134,00:16:11.303,"Ay, yeah. The box is across the yard."
00:16:11.387,00:16:14.556,You mean your now-soaking-wet yard? That’s great. We are screwed.
00:16:14.640,00:16:18.977,"No, we’re not. We haven’t unwrapped our secret weapon yet."
00:16:19.061,00:16:22.481,"Luke walks over there, Hurt Locker style..."
00:16:38.414,00:16:40.708,Hurt Locker? It’s more like Squirt Locker.
00:16:42.752,00:16:46.505,Really? That wasn’t funny? I actually pity you guys.
00:16:51.344,00:16:53.554,No time to celebrate! Stop it!
00:16:53.638,00:16:56.348,We don’t have a lot of time.
00:16:56.432,00:16:58.600,"If I can have the little ones down front– You know what, sir?"
00:16:58.684,00:17:01.353,"If you don’t mind, I’ve got this. Come on, people, let’s get out here."
00:17:01.437,00:17:03.564,"Haley, Alex, I need you to unwrap your brother."
00:17:03.648,00:17:06.191,"All right, I need the Dunphys over on this side."
00:17:06.275,00:17:12.072,"Dad, you’re in the middle. Mitchell, Cam, Lily on this end. Okay."
00:17:12.156,00:17:14.032,Listen.
00:17:14.116,00:17:20.205,"Honey, I screwed up, but if ever you’re in my arms again– Phil, not now."
00:17:24.210,00:17:25.711,"Phil, we’ll talk about what you did later."
00:17:25.795,00:17:27.546,"Okay, everybody. Eyes over here."
00:17:27.630,00:17:31.758,I didn’t do anything. She kissed me.
00:17:39.392,00:17:41.310,"No, no."
00:17:41.394,00:17:44.062,Was this before or after you ignored the phone call from your wife?
00:17:46.190,00:17:49.401,Could we please just take the damn picture?
00:17:49.485,00:17:51.737,"Okay. Everybody, one more time."
00:17:51.821,00:17:54.615,"Just so you know, I am angry with you."
00:17:54.699,00:17:59.244,"- Oh, damn it! - It was a big day for me, and he didn’t want to go because he doesn’t like small talk."
00:17:59.328,00:18:01.205,Would it be terribly inconvenient...
00:18:01.289,00:18:03.415,to just postpone this hissy fit for a few minutes?
00:18:03.499,00:18:06.418,- Maybe some of us don’t want to take a picture today. - Thank you.
00:18:09.255,00:18:11.423,"Oh, shut up, Cam."
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.143,and who is wearing an outrageously inappropriate dress.
00:18:23.227,00:18:27.105,We are gonna get together and act like a normal family...
00:18:27.189,00:18:30.525,"for one-tenth of a freaking second, and we’re gonna do it right now."
00:18:33.696,00:18:37.282,"Ah, this is ridiculous. You’re both uptight about everything."
00:18:37.366,00:18:41.620,You didn’t want to go to a wedding with him because you didn’t want to make small talk?
00:18:41.704,00:18:44.456,That’s how I met Gloria. Do you remember the first thing I said to you?
00:18:44.540,00:18:49.670,"Yes. I like chocolate, I like fruit, but not together."
00:18:49.754,00:18:52.047,"You couldn’t come up with that, Ivy League? And you."
00:18:52.131,00:18:55.801,You would be a lot happier if you weren’t so obsessed with everything being perfect.
00:18:55.885,00:18:58.887,"Look at us here all in white. What are we, a cricket team?"
00:19:04.477,00:19:07.354,"Okay, Dad, that’s great, and that’s really easy for you to say."
00:19:07.438,00:19:11.316,"But do you think I like being like this? No, I don’t."
00:19:11.400,00:19:14.737,"If you have some quick-and-easy fix, why don’t you just give it to me right now?"
00:19:18.616,00:19:20.742,Oh.
00:19:23.162,00:19:25.831,"I– I got this, baby."
00:19:31.087,00:19:35.257,"Well, three."
00:19:43.015,00:19:46.560,"Everybody get back in line. Come on, guys, stop."
00:19:51.148,00:19:55.235,Excuse me. Are we still doing this?
00:19:55.319,00:19:57.571,"No. No, we’re not."
00:20:07.873,00:20:11.460,Whoo-hoo!
00:20:18.926,00:20:26.224,"I had this mental picture of the family that, if I was lucky enough, one day I would end up with– perfect wife, perfect kids."
00:20:26.308,00:20:28.560,Guess what. I didn’t get any of that.
00:20:28.644,00:20:30.937,Wound up with this sorry bunch.
00:20:31.021,00:20:34.358,And I’m thankful for that every day.
00:20:34.442,00:20:36.526,"Well, most days."
00:20:36.610,00:20:38.570,I think I’m just gonna go with the Elvis stuff.
00:20:38.654,00:20:41.115,Yeah. I would.
00:20:44.160,00:20:46.912,"Uh, to the right. To the right."
00:20:46.996,00:20:48.747,A skosh to the left.
00:20:51.625,00:20:55.253,Whatever. I’m gonna have to take the picture down when I repaint the wall anyhow.
00:20:55.337,00:20:58.090,Kill me now.
00:21:01.010,00:21:04.221,Mm-hmm.
00:21:04.305,00:21:07.016,- I love that picture. - Yeah.
00:21:10.478,00:21:12.813,- Is that a chip on the frame right there? - No. No.
00:21:12.897,00:21:14.815,I can see it.
