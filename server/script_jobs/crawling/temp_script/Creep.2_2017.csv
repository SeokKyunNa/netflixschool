00:01:08.318,00:01:09.986,"Oh, fuck."
00:01:15.075,00:01:16.993,Holy shit.
00:01:27.295,00:01:28.588,"Fuck, no."
00:02:37.490,00:02:39.409,"Uh, yeah, you should pick on somewhere to seat."
00:02:40.118,00:02:40.952,Um...
00:02:44.497,00:02:46.833,I told you I was getting those calls?
00:02:47.333,00:02:49.961,"And, uh, that I had that DVD sent to me?"
00:02:51.212,00:02:53.006,It's... it's happening again?
00:02:53.506,00:02:55.174,"Yeah, um..."
00:02:55.466,00:02:57.760,"-Oh, my god. -And I thought it was over, but, um..."
00:02:57.844,00:03:00.430,"I just had a package outside, and, uh..."
00:03:00.513,00:03:03.349,"-Just now? -Yeah. Then, that... That was in it."
00:03:10.982,00:03:15.403,This person sent you a stuffed baby wolf?
00:03:16.195,00:03:19.616,"-I mean, I guess... -It doesn't make any sense."
00:03:19.699,00:03:22.952,"I mean, there's also this DVD that was in it, and..."
00:03:23.036,00:03:24.162,What do you mean?
00:03:27.916,00:03:29.125,"Dave, this is your..."
00:03:29.959,00:03:31.085,That's your home.
00:03:31.419,00:03:33.379,"-Dave! -Yeah, I know, I know, I know."
00:03:34.088,00:03:35.089,This is serious!
00:03:35.173,00:03:37.884,"Whoever shot this, they shot it last night."
00:03:42.096,00:03:43.431,And that's me last night.
00:03:43.514,00:03:45.183,"Well, we have to call the police."
00:03:45.266,00:03:46.893,You need to call the police! This is serious!
00:03:46.976,00:03:48.102,"No, no. No."
00:03:48.186,00:03:52.190,"I already called the police the last time, and nothing happened, okay?"
00:03:52.273,00:03:53.566,"They said, they would not..."
00:03:53.650,00:03:54.692,"Well, that is unconscionable."
00:03:54.776,00:03:57.070,"-That is unconscionable. -No, they didn't even send a patrol car."
00:03:57.153,00:03:58.738,-You have a knife? -Nothing's happened.
00:03:58.821,00:04:00.073,Where is your gun?
00:04:02.742,00:04:04.118,"-Well, you need... -I do not own a gun."
00:04:04.202,00:04:06.704,"-Well, you are gonna need something. -That's not... It's not necessary."
00:04:06.788,00:04:08.998,"Dave, I don't think you're taking this seriously enough."
00:04:09.082,00:04:11.209,"I'm sorry. I am okay. I just ambushed you, uh..."
00:04:11.292,00:04:13.836,"-No, it's all good, man. It's all good. -No, no. Um..."
00:04:13.920,00:04:14.796,Do you want a beer?
00:04:14.879,00:04:16.589,-I would love one. Thank you. -Yeah? Okay.
00:04:16.673,00:04:19.467,"-Yeah, I think I need some alcohol. -Okay."
00:04:19.550,00:04:20.802,Okay. All right.
00:04:22.345,00:04:23.554,"This is crazy, Dave."
00:04:34.065,00:04:35.525,Hello.
00:04:44.284,00:04:47.036,"So, what is going on with you?"
00:04:48.746,00:04:50.707,Are you serious? What is going on with me?
00:04:51.666,00:04:52.542,Yeah.
00:04:52.875,00:04:54.377,"Goddamn, you're awesome."
00:04:54.919,00:05:01.676,"I mean, here you are, dealing with this potential stalker situation, and you're concerned with me and my feelings."
00:05:03.553,00:05:04.804,"I fucking love you, man."
00:05:04.887,00:05:05.722,Oh.
00:05:05.805,00:05:07.598,-Cheers. -Cheers.
00:05:16.566,00:05:19.193,"-This is great, isn't it? -Yeah."
00:05:19.277,00:05:21.237,Two guys just hanging out.
00:05:21.321,00:05:22.905,Throwing back a couple of cold ones.
00:05:22.989,00:05:23.865,Mm-hm.
00:05:25.074,00:05:27.785,I really wish I didn't have to say what I have to say to you tonight.
00:05:31.456,00:05:32.832,"Oh, what's that?"
00:05:38.212,00:05:39.505,I'm worried about us.
00:05:40.798,00:05:41.966,Mm.
00:05:43.134,00:05:45.303,"-Oh, you are? -Aren't you?"
00:05:46.095,00:05:48.973,Us... Us? We are good. We are friends. We...
00:05:49.724,00:05:51.601,"We hang out sometimes, we're..."
00:05:53.019,00:05:54.020,"Come on, Dave."
00:05:54.103,00:05:56.439,You and I both know there's a lot more at stake than that.
00:05:56.814,00:06:04.072,"-Look... -Meeting at the same coffee shop, on the same Tuesday morning, reading the same exact edition of Infinite Jest."
00:06:05.073,00:06:07.116,"I mean, if that was not kismet..."
00:06:07.200,00:06:12.080,"If we were not meant to be best friends or soul mates, to be starting out so hot and heavy like that, and then..."
00:06:13.372,00:06:14.874,We turn into this?
00:06:16.709,00:06:18.044,"Well, it's disappointing."
00:06:19.670,00:06:21.547,And I can't help but think if we...
00:06:23.174,00:06:25.885,"If we are not headed for greatness, then maybe we just..."
00:06:26.385,00:06:27.845,end it right here.
00:06:28.638,00:06:29.472,Tonight.
00:06:30.473,00:06:31.849,"Okay, I don't think that is necessary."
00:06:31.933,00:06:34.560,"Dave, if I asked you a question, would you answer me honestly?"
00:06:35.895,00:06:37.355,Yeah. Of course.
00:06:39.774,00:06:41.692,Do you ever think about how...
00:06:43.236,00:06:47.532,we met around right around the same time you received your first DVD in the mail?
00:06:51.786,00:06:53.704,"You just thought about it, didn't you?"
00:06:54.288,00:06:56.082,"-I didn't. -Dave, you just thought about it."
00:06:56.165,00:06:59.127,"-No, I didn't, I swear. -Dave, listen to me. It's okay. Okay?"
00:06:59.877,00:07:03.714,"Everything that is about to happen to you here tonight is okay, and it's not your fault."
00:07:03.798,00:07:04.674,Do you understand me?
00:07:04.757,00:07:06.300,"-No, I don't understand. -Okay, now, listen."
00:07:06.384,00:07:08.719,"There is a camera inside of this wolf, okay?"
00:07:08.803,00:07:11.848,"Now, I have been filming you in some way, shape, or form, since the day we met."
00:07:11.931,00:07:13.599,This is Baby Peach Fuzz. Say hi.
00:07:13.683,00:07:17.687,I was going to record our entire relationship and commemorate it with a beautiful 80-minute film.
00:07:17.770,00:07:19.063,And you deserve that.
00:07:19.439,00:07:20.731,"You deserve it, because..."
00:07:21.441,00:07:22.692,You're a beautiful person.
00:07:22.775,00:07:25.736,"And I want to give that to you, so bad, but..."
00:07:26.779,00:07:27.947,I can't.
00:07:28.531,00:07:30.700,Because ever since I turned 40...
00:07:31.659,00:07:33.870,"I don't know what is happening to me, Dave, I just..."
00:07:34.203,00:07:35.413,I've lost my inspiration.
00:07:35.496,00:07:37.957,I have no joy in my work.
00:07:38.666,00:07:40.418,I don't even know if I can do this anymore.
00:07:48.384,00:07:49.677,Goddamn it.
00:07:56.309,00:07:57.852,What is happening to me?
00:09:21.310,00:09:28.192,The show where I Iook behind the strange world of online personal ads to try to uncover the humanity within.
00:09:35.491,00:09:38.452,If you don't mind Marilyn Monroe already lives on the wall.
00:09:41.872,00:09:44.166,"So, you were talking about your pottery earlier."
00:09:44.250,00:09:45.835,-Yeah. -And you were telling me about it.
00:09:49.797,00:09:50.923,What is their story?
00:09:51.382,00:09:53.509,This place has a cold energy to it.
00:09:54.635,00:10:00.641,Most of the spirit pods that I build are to deflect that cold energy.
00:10:01.267,00:10:04.729,This is my little Jaws 2. He is a little shark.
00:10:17.366,00:10:19.994,What did you... What were you looking for when you posted your ad?
00:10:20.077,00:10:21.495,"Just, you know..."
00:10:25.625,00:10:27.001,It's nice to have someone to talk to.
00:10:42.933,00:10:44.143,-It's okay? -Yup.
00:10:52.151,00:11:01.911,"Hush, little baby, don't say a word Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird And if that mockingbird doesn't sing..."
00:11:05.623,00:11:06.457,Awesome.
00:11:07.958,00:11:09.960,And if that diamond ring...
00:11:10.044,00:11:13.798,Hey. This is Sara. Welcome to Encounters.
00:11:13.881,00:11:16.467,The web series that nobody gives a shit about.
00:11:16.550,00:11:19.512,And I am starting to realize why nobody is watching.
00:11:19.970,00:11:22.306,It's because it sucks!
00:11:24.558,00:11:31.023,And if that billy goat don't pull I think I might be deeply untalented.
00:11:35.111,00:11:36.028,"Oh, man."
00:11:36.987,00:11:43.244,I thought I had a talent for bringing out something weird and special and taboo and secret in people.
00:11:43.702,00:11:47.498,That there was a loneliness that I could detect that I really empathized with.
00:11:48.207,00:11:51.293,And I... I see glimpses of it sometimes.
00:11:51.377,00:11:52.420,And it is so exciting.
00:11:52.503,00:11:54.672,And I am close. I can feel it.
00:11:54.755,00:11:57.007,But I never follow through in the right way.
00:11:57.091,00:11:58.217,And I am tired of trying.
00:11:58.300,00:12:00.469,"And I am tired of failing, it is humiliating."
00:12:01.971,00:12:03.931,I never expected to make money doing this.
00:12:04.014,00:12:08.811,"But I thought, at least, I would be able to reach some other weirdos, and make something special for them."
00:12:12.690,00:12:13.816,"So, I am Sara."
00:12:14.525,00:12:17.153,Welcome to Encounters. This is our finale.
00:12:17.236,00:12:20.114,The closing episode of the entire season.
00:12:20.197,00:12:23.451,Join me as we encounter my failure.
00:12:24.535,00:12:26.036,I hope you enjoy it.
00:12:28.289,00:12:30.040,"Hey, sorry about last night."
00:12:30.124,00:12:32.960,"I got a little bit dramatic, but I'm feeling a lot better now."
00:12:33.043,00:12:34.378,I've had my coffee.
00:12:34.462,00:12:37.047,And I found this.
00:12:43.304,00:12:47.057,A thousand dollars for the day. Honesty and emotional bravery a must.
00:12:47.141,00:12:49.852,Fans of Interview with the Vampire a plus.
00:12:49.935,00:12:51.979,Let's go deep. Together.
00:12:54.732,00:12:55.691,Interesting.
00:13:34.730,00:13:35.731,Fuck it.
00:13:50.287,00:13:51.330,What?
00:14:13.352,00:14:17.106,And I have been driving like three hours now.
00:14:24.071,00:14:26.365,It's a lot more remote than I had anticipated.
00:14:31.370,00:14:33.622,"Seven, four, five, yeah."
00:14:41.046,00:14:41.964,Okay.
00:14:43.382,00:14:45.551,Hey! Welcome to Encounters.
00:14:45.634,00:14:47.803,I'm Sara. This is episode ten of ten.
00:14:48.512,00:14:54.476,"And, normally, this is where I tell you that I'm gonna go see John, a mid-level manager at Walgreens."
00:14:54.560,00:14:56.937,"And that we are gonna work through his mommy issues, through..."
00:14:57.521,00:14:59.356,"I don't know, synchronized swimming or some shit."
00:14:59.440,00:15:01.233,But I don't have that today.
00:15:01.692,00:15:03.277,I know very little about this guy.
00:15:03.360,00:15:06.530,"He's, uh, been ghosting me since he sent me his address."
00:15:07.865,00:15:10.200,And I have no idea what I am stepping into.
00:15:10.993,00:15:14.079,"Normally, this is not a situation I would allow myself to get into."
00:15:15.039,00:15:17.833,But maybe that's why the show has been sucking so much.
00:15:18.167,00:15:19.793,"So, let's see what happens."
00:16:06.131,00:16:08.258,"Oh, sorry."
00:16:19.561,00:16:20.980,Green smoothie?
00:16:24.483,00:16:25.734,It's very healthy.
00:16:27.861,00:16:37.871,"Kale, four frozen strawberries, one banana, one heaping tablespoon of non-fat plain, Greek yogurt, two pinches spirulina, and one pinch of cinnamon."
00:16:42.835,00:16:43.836,It's good.
00:16:44.461,00:16:45.879,It's also poisoned.
00:16:46.630,00:16:48.048,"Obviously, I'm kidding."
00:16:54.346,00:16:55.514,"Wow, that's your real name."
00:16:58.892,00:16:59.935,"Yeah, I can tell."
00:17:00.644,00:17:01.937,Thanks for that.
00:17:12.197,00:17:14.742,I like that you came in already filming.
00:17:17.202,00:17:19.663,"Yeah. You know, people don't really believe in that."
00:17:19.747,00:17:21.874,You gotta keep the camera on if you wanna keep the magic.
00:17:21.957,00:17:23.125,"I mean wouldn't it, you know..."
00:17:23.208,00:17:25.085,You and I kind of have a thing. I like that.
00:17:26.128,00:17:28.922,"That is a nice camera, by the way. Are you a filmmaker by trade?"
00:17:32.843,00:17:35.763,"I'm actually applying to grad school right now, and I'm trying to save up."
00:17:41.185,00:17:42.102,Cool.
00:17:45.147,00:17:47.316,"My story, um..."
00:17:47.399,00:17:50.611,I am what is commonly known as a serial killer.
00:17:51.070,00:17:53.739,"Um, I don't love that nomenclature."
00:17:53.822,00:17:55.365,I sort of consider myself a murderer.
00:17:55.449,00:18:00.412,But my numbers are such that I am now classified as a serial killer.
00:18:02.873,00:18:04.792,I have killed 39 people.
00:18:04.875,00:18:07.586,This is something that I love to do. It's the greatest job in the world.
00:18:07.669,00:18:08.754,It's what I am built to do.
00:18:08.837,00:18:15.094,"Um, but I am also turning 40 this year, it is just like, grays in the beard, a lot of stuff happening, and..."
00:18:15.177,00:18:19.640,"It's making me a little mid-lifey, and it's kind of sent me into a little bit of a spiral."
00:18:20.224,00:18:23.685,And I think I fucked myself in the head.
00:18:24.770,00:18:30.984,"I don't trust my instincts anymore, and I feel like I may have lost what made me great."
00:18:31.068,00:18:46.792,"There was a time in my life when I would meet a man at a bar, and I would take him outside and lay him on the floor, and I would put a knife in his chest and gut him open, and open his insides, and the universe would reveal itself to me, and it was beautiful."
00:18:47.209,00:18:51.004,"And I felt part of every time, and every place that had ever existed."
00:18:51.672,00:18:53.590,It was my religion.
00:18:54.174,00:18:55.968,"But, now, it..."
00:18:58.762,00:19:00.514,It is like a job.
00:19:02.057,00:19:05.352,And it makes me really fucking sad.
00:19:06.603,00:19:08.063,And I don't wanna get emotional.
00:19:08.856,00:19:11.650,But I'm having a hard time.
00:19:12.985,00:19:14.153,But then...
00:19:14.820,00:19:17.447,I read an article about the great Francis Ford Coppola.
00:19:17.531,00:19:20.742,He said something that blew my fucking mind.
00:19:21.285,00:19:25.164,"He said, I have not made an original film since The Conversation in 1974."
00:19:25.247,00:19:29.042,"I am not sure I am capable of it, but I really want to keep trying."
00:19:30.002,00:19:32.379,"And, man, that hit me like a sack of bricks."
00:19:32.462,00:19:35.966,Here is a man who is in the middle of his artistic decline.
00:19:36.049,00:19:38.594,"Is he running from it? No, he is embracing it."
00:19:39.136,00:19:40.095,"So, I'm like..."
00:19:40.554,00:19:42.890,"What am I doing, trying to make the films that I used to make?"
00:19:42.973,00:19:45.601,What if I embrace where I am at right now?
00:19:45.684,00:19:48.145,What if I make a documentary?
00:19:48.687,00:19:50.230,And this is where you come in.
00:19:50.689,00:19:56.570,A documentary about the world's most prolific serial killer that no one knows about.
00:19:57.321,00:20:01.074,"A documentary that you and I make here, tonight."
00:20:02.910,00:20:04.077,"Now, look."
00:20:04.161,00:20:08.582,"I realize I am throwing a lot at you, you have not even had a chance to finish your green smoothie."
00:20:08.665,00:20:11.543,"So, if you want to bail, I completely understand."
00:20:11.627,00:20:15.172,"Take your money, no hard feelings. I understand."
00:20:16.924,00:20:18.258,But if you don't.
00:20:19.760,00:20:21.303,And I really hope you don't.
00:20:23.639,00:20:25.098,I can offer you two things.
00:20:26.058,00:20:30.854,"Firstly, I will not kill you over the next 24 hours, that would be counterproductive."
00:20:31.563,00:20:32.773,And secondly...
00:20:33.774,00:20:39.029,I will give you the deepest personal access into my soul that you could possibly imagine.
00:20:39.112,00:20:44.159,I will rip myself open and let you see every last inch of me.
00:20:44.701,00:20:48.038,"And together, I believe, we will make magic."
00:20:50.749,00:20:52.042,But you got to be into it.
00:20:56.672,00:20:59.258,"Are you just saying you are into it, because you want a job?"
00:21:01.468,00:21:03.804,and I think this sounds great. I want to do it.
00:21:03.887,00:21:05.806,I don't hear any passion in your voice.
00:21:16.984,00:21:18.110,Hm.
00:21:36.545,00:21:37.504,He's my friend.
00:21:48.098,00:21:49.933,All good things to those who wait.
00:23:08.762,00:23:09.638,So...
00:23:21.566,00:23:23.527,-I think it's interesting. -Mm-hm.
00:23:31.368,00:23:32.744,Did you wanted to scare me?
00:23:35.831,00:23:36.665,I'll be right back.
00:23:50.846,00:23:52.305,What the fuck?
00:24:05.318,00:24:06.194,So...
00:24:07.779,00:24:09.656,"I was thinking upstairs, that..."
00:24:12.117,00:24:18.206,"When men are in a locker room, they snap towels at each other's genitals, without any inhibitions."
00:24:18.290,00:24:25.547,"Uh, when women try on clothes in changing rooms, there is no barrier to their intimacy."
00:24:26.965,00:24:30.343,"But with a man and a woman, there is always a wall between them."
00:24:31.094,00:24:32.596,And that wall is...
00:24:33.847,00:24:35.682,I wonder what you look like naked.
00:24:37.058,00:24:41.354,"And if I'm being honest, that's something I have felt."
00:24:46.318,00:24:48.445,And if we're gonna embark on this journey together...
00:24:49.905,00:24:51.781,we need to tear that wall down.
00:25:06.338,00:25:07.380,How do you feel?
00:25:14.512,00:25:22.312,"I just think it is important that, if there is a wall and a gender divide, this is a spiritual journey, so we need to eradicate...."
00:25:28.610,00:25:30.487,Okay. Then we're good.
00:25:33.365,00:25:34.282,I'm sorry?
00:26:19.536,00:26:20.787,Are we good?
00:26:28.211,00:26:29.254,Okay.
00:26:41.433,00:26:43.893,"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit."
00:26:46.730,00:26:47.772,Okay.
00:26:49.024,00:26:49.941,Okay.
00:26:51.067,00:26:54.321,"Sara, every red flag you have has been raised."
00:26:54.946,00:26:56.323,Um...
00:26:56.406,00:26:59.534,He is highly unpredictable and potentially dangerous.
00:26:59.617,00:27:03.663,And you are not there for ten minutes before his dick was in your face.
00:27:04.664,00:27:07.917,"Sara, you were not there for ten minutes before his dick was in your face."
00:27:08.001,00:27:10.003,He is everything you have ever wanted in a subject.
00:27:10.628,00:27:12.047,You have to chase this.
00:27:13.882,00:27:14.841,I'm coming.
00:27:21.222,00:27:22.807,I have to do this.
00:27:24.893,00:27:28.021,And I am like 99.9% positive he is not a killer.
00:27:28.104,00:27:30.982,"But just in case he is, I am not a total fucking idiot."
00:27:31.858,00:27:32.692,Knife.
00:27:34.778,00:27:36.780,I'm coming. One minute.
00:27:40.033,00:27:43.787,Hey. I'm Sara. Welcome to Encounters.
00:27:44.621,00:27:46.498,Here we fucking go.
00:27:59.219,00:28:01.721,Wow. You're a tough nut to crack.
00:28:02.180,00:28:03.306,I don't know.
00:28:08.686,00:28:12.023,"Oh, this? That is... It's just my beard pattern."
00:28:12.107,00:28:15.026,Some men have little patches. It is just one of my patches.
00:28:15.110,00:28:16.986,"Um... All right, we should get going."
00:28:29.707,00:28:32.544,All right. I will get you at some point.
00:28:36.589,00:28:37.757,Where are you from?
00:28:55.817,00:28:57.152,Can you see in that thing?
00:29:04.200,00:29:06.202,It could complicate what you do for a living.
00:29:37.650,00:29:44.282,"Well, what if I told you that, at the end of this road, I was going to cut off your head, and snuggle-fuck it?"
00:30:07.889,00:30:11.434,"I'm sorry, I have a perfect, idyllic spot picked out for this interview."
00:30:11.518,00:30:15.230,"Can we just... Let's just save it, okay?"
00:30:18.858,00:30:19.859,"Thanks, Sara."
00:30:20.443,00:30:21.444,You're gonna love it!
00:30:34.499,00:30:35.959,Where is the water?
00:30:39.587,00:30:43.716,"No, no, no. The raging river of water that was here when I scouted it."
00:30:43.800,00:30:46.719,"It was... You know, I had the whole shot planned."
00:30:46.803,00:30:47.846,I was gonna be here.
00:30:47.929,00:30:51.808,Submerged in the water up to my neck for the whole Jesus metaphor.
00:30:51.891,00:30:55.311,"And that's, um, the... I mean, the bridge!"
00:30:55.395,00:30:56.938,That was the final scene.
00:30:57.021,00:30:59.649,"I was gonna jump off the bridge, splash into the water."
00:30:59.732,00:31:01.818,You cut into something really cool.
00:31:01.901,00:31:03.570,"I mean, that's the ending of the scene. We..."
00:31:04.445,00:31:07.073,We don't have an ending. We don't even have a scene.
00:31:07.156,00:31:08.324,This is not...
00:31:09.868,00:31:12.829,"This is... This is, uh..."
00:31:12.912,00:31:14.330,No. No. No.
00:31:36.644,00:31:38.438,Why are you saying Coppola? What?
00:31:40.440,00:31:43.985,Francis Ford Coppola.
00:31:45.194,00:31:46.070,What would he do?
00:31:51.784,00:31:52.785,Huh.
00:31:58.625,00:32:00.001,That's really fucking smart.
00:32:08.426,00:32:13.056,December 1978. It was the last days of disco.
00:32:13.514,00:32:16.351,The Cold War was heating up by the minute.
00:32:16.434,00:32:20.438,"But in a nondescript home, in a nondescript town..."
00:32:23.024,00:32:24.651,This is... whilst here...
00:32:24.734,00:32:30.782,"If the visual effects of the water were up here, with it, you know what I am saying?"
00:32:33.201,00:32:34.327,What do you think? Should we?
00:32:39.999,00:32:42.001,"Sorry, I got a little... I got some sunblock in my eye."
00:32:42.961,00:32:43.920,Mm.
00:32:49.717,00:32:51.803,Airplane. Wait. Let us wait this out.
00:32:55.431,00:32:56.891,It's a really slow airplane.
00:32:58.142,00:32:59.102,How's the pony?
00:33:02.438,00:33:05.608,"Would you mind coming out real quick and just give me a little, a little fix?"
00:33:07.318,00:33:10.321,"Sorry, I don't wanna get your shoes wet, but I just wanna make sure it's right."
00:33:21.124,00:33:22.000,Just tighten it.
00:33:23.459,00:33:24.752,"Oh, I didn't want you to redo..."
00:33:24.836,00:33:26.587,"Oh, that's okay, no problem. We'll do it."
00:33:26.671,00:33:28.006,Just do the whole thing.
00:33:33.052,00:33:37.390,December 1978. It was the last days of disco.
00:33:37.807,00:33:40.059,The Cold War was just heating up.
00:33:40.560,00:33:41.686,But in a small town...
00:33:44.897,00:33:46.774,Little bird right there. Hold on.
00:33:48.151,00:33:50.111,December 19...
00:33:54.032,00:33:55.199,It's like a bad joke!
00:33:55.658,00:33:56.534,Hey!
00:33:58.619,00:34:02.206,One more. Try it one more time. One more time!
00:34:03.416,00:34:06.711,I want you to do it! I want you to do it!
00:34:14.343,00:34:18.806,It was December 1978. It was the last days of disco.
00:34:19.307,00:34:20.266,The Cold War was just...
00:34:24.604,00:34:25.980,Do you wanna retake this?
00:34:29.567,00:34:30.443,Aaron?
00:35:08.731,00:35:11.859,"Okay, so it turns out Aaron is a bit of a drama queen."
00:35:14.153,00:35:17.198,I'm not sure if he is used to collaboration.
00:35:24.372,00:35:25.248,Aaron?
00:35:43.057,00:35:44.600,This day might be a wash.
00:35:47.603,00:35:48.437,And I'm just not ready.
00:35:50.982,00:35:51.816,Aaron?
00:35:54.360,00:35:55.528,"Aaron, is that you?"
00:36:20.344,00:36:21.387,Aaron?
00:37:29.747,00:37:30.581,Hey.
00:37:31.832,00:37:33.209,Aaron's not talking anymore.
00:37:34.001,00:37:36.712,He's kind of shut down since his tantrum at the river.
00:37:36.879,00:37:43.678,"And I don't know if you can hear it, but he has been blasting the same shit '90s jam band song on loop for the past hour."
00:37:46.597,00:37:48.391,He's so vulnerable right now.
00:37:48.474,00:37:51.185,And I know the decent thing to do is just give him some space.
00:37:51.894,00:37:56.565,"But, at the same time, it would be so easy to go down there and provoke him."
00:37:57.400,00:37:58.901,And get the material I need.
00:38:47.033,00:38:48.576,You should probably go.
00:38:50.661,00:38:51.829,Why should I go?
00:38:51.912,00:38:53.289,Because I want you to go.
00:38:55.708,00:38:57.001,How come?
00:38:57.084,00:39:00.087,Because I don't want you to take this documentary anymore.
00:39:00.171,00:39:02.381,"Take your money and go, please."
00:39:02.465,00:39:03.966,What is going on? What is the problem?
00:39:04.050,00:39:05.343,Sara. Leave.
00:39:07.803,00:39:09.513,"Aaron, I am not leaving."
00:39:11.432,00:39:12.850,I'm sorry?
00:39:13.851,00:39:17.688,"You told me that once we get started, there is no turning back."
00:39:20.232,00:39:21.484,I'm not turning back.
00:39:24.236,00:39:25.529,Turn that song back on.
00:39:30.034,00:39:34.205,"Because it is my favorite song in the world, and I need it because I love it."
00:39:36.582,00:39:44.882,"Um, maybe because it does more with one instrumental slow jam than any poet with any quill has ever done in the history of time, ever."
00:39:47.009,00:39:48.552,"Well, you wouldn't have."
00:39:49.303,00:39:51.806,Barely anyone has. It's from an unknown band.
00:39:52.515,00:39:54.266,From a long time ago.
00:39:58.771,00:40:00.147,And it's not gonna work.
00:40:04.068,00:40:05.236,Because...
00:40:06.195,00:40:09.240,You think you want to know my story.
00:40:09.907,00:40:13.077,"But I promise you, you do not wanna know my story."
00:40:18.124,00:40:18.999,Really?
00:40:22.044,00:40:23.087,Fine.
00:40:24.839,00:40:29.135,"I was 15 years old, but I could pass for 18 'cause I was big for my age."
00:40:29.218,00:40:31.554,I could go to bars and see live music.
00:40:31.637,00:40:33.889,An obscure band came to town.
00:40:34.932,00:40:43.107,"There weren't more than seven of us in the audience, but I was mesmerized, in particular, by a song called Sara Loves Her Juicy Fruit."
00:40:43.482,00:40:45.401,It transported me.
00:40:45.484,00:40:50.030,"That night, I went out of town with the band, and I partied with them where they were staying."
00:40:51.574,00:40:53.826,I felt like I belonged for the first time.
00:40:55.661,00:40:59.874,"But, of course, they had to move on to another city the next day."
00:41:00.875,00:41:06.130,"I walked back towards town, and a man pulled over to offer me a ride."
00:41:06.213,00:41:09.175,"He had a nice, kind face."
00:41:10.301,00:41:12.094,"And as he opened the door, he said something to me."
00:41:12.178,00:41:13.053,I will never forget it.
00:41:13.137,00:41:15.681,"He said, Oh, my god."
00:41:17.224,00:41:18.517,"Oh, my god."
00:41:19.643,00:41:21.395,This is gonna be a good day.
00:41:23.439,00:41:29.320,"He did not take me back to town. He took me to a remote part of the woods, where he beat me within an inch of my life."
00:41:30.070,00:41:33.532,"He gave me a shovel, he forced me to dig my own grave."
00:41:33.616,00:41:40.581,He tied my hands behind my back and informed me that he would be burying me alive within the next couple of minutes.
00:41:40.664,00:41:42.416,And I remember thinking to myself...
00:41:43.501,00:41:46.962,I should be feeling really badly about this man.
00:41:48.047,00:41:51.800,But he was magnetic. I loved him.
00:41:52.176,00:41:57.515,"He was smart, he was commanding, he was wonderful in all ways."
00:41:57.598,00:41:59.266,He only had one flaw.
00:41:59.350,00:42:02.228,He was not very good at tying knots.
00:42:02.645,00:42:11.695,"And as I loosen my hands from behind my back, and I wrapped them around his neck, overpowering him with my size."
00:42:13.572,00:42:19.203,I drained his life with my hands.
00:42:20.037,00:42:21.956,And I thought to myself...
00:42:24.583,00:42:26.919,"Well, this is my destiny."
00:42:28.587,00:42:35.553,'Sara Loves Her Juicy Fruit' and Aaron loves to kill.
00:42:37.596,00:42:39.181,I stripped him of his clothes.
00:42:39.265,00:42:41.850,I threw his body in the hole he made me dig for myself.
00:42:41.934,00:42:48.107,"And on instinct, I took off my own clothes and I lay there, communing next to him all night, naked."
00:42:48.524,00:42:50.401,And something very interesting happened.
00:42:50.776,00:42:51.986,You see...
00:42:53.571,00:42:55.239,I lied to you earlier.
00:42:56.949,00:42:58.742,About my beard holes.
00:42:59.493,00:43:01.412,It is not my hair pattern.
00:43:01.495,00:43:04.540,It's actually a rare disease called trichotillomania.
00:43:05.958,00:43:09.795,"You know, when people pull hairs out of their beard or their scalp, or even their eyebrows."
00:43:09.878,00:43:12.089,"You see, my first victim had this disease."
00:43:12.172,00:43:18.637,"And when I laid with him naked, my spirit consumed that from his spirit."
00:43:19.179,00:43:20.806,And it became a ritual of mine.
00:43:20.889,00:43:25.769,"All of my victims, I lay with them naked. And I take a part of them with me."
00:43:27.438,00:43:28.814,And here I am now.
00:43:29.440,00:43:35.696,"A strange, but wonderful amalgamation of all the 39 men and women that I have killed."
00:43:35.779,00:43:38.907,And it has been the most glorious part of my life.
00:43:38.991,00:43:42.202,It has been my raison d'être.
00:43:43.579,00:43:44.872,And now...
00:43:46.457,00:43:47.791,It's gone.
00:43:51.128,00:43:54.131,And that is why I am sad.
00:43:55.174,00:43:58.093,And that is why I have nothing to live for anymore.
00:43:58.177,00:44:01.472,And that is why I want you to go because tonight...
00:44:01.889,00:44:04.975,is going to be a very bad...
00:44:07.019,00:44:08.270,bad night.
00:44:10.856,00:44:11.732,Sara.
00:44:36.674,00:44:38.008,Close your eyes.
00:44:38.300,00:44:39.968,-I do not want to. -Do it.
00:45:09.540,00:45:10.791,Do you feel better?
00:45:13.127,00:45:15.421,-A little bit. -Good.
00:45:21.635,00:45:23.303,I'm gonna go take a shower now.
00:45:49.413,00:45:50.330,Um...
00:45:51.331,00:45:54.334,Thank you for...
00:45:56.962,00:45:58.297,Um...
00:45:59.173,00:46:00.299,doing what you just did.
00:46:00.382,00:46:06.180,"I think you are really, really special."
00:46:06.263,00:46:14.313,And you are inspiring feelings in me that I thought I would never feel again.
00:46:14.396,00:46:15.397,And...
00:46:19.109,00:46:20.611,I do not know what to do.
00:47:45.404,00:47:46.363,How do you feel?
00:48:01.545,00:48:03.046,Forty-eight...
00:48:03.839,00:48:05.424,Forty-nine...
00:48:06.258,00:48:07.259,Fifty!
00:48:07.593,00:48:10.596,"Ready or not, here I come!"
00:48:18.020,00:48:19.271,Where did you go?
00:48:21.064,00:48:23.150,I'm coming for you.
00:48:24.526,00:48:25.902,I got a...
00:48:26.778,00:48:28.322,Uh-oh.
00:48:29.364,00:48:31.241,I think I found you.
00:48:37.164,00:48:38.373,Sara?
00:48:40.167,00:48:41.710,Are you being bad?
00:48:45.505,00:48:47.424,"Sara, where did you go?"
00:48:52.262,00:48:53.221,Damn it!
00:49:11.865,00:49:14.701,"Aaron, if I ask you a question, will you answer honestly?"
00:49:15.744,00:49:17.204,Of course. Always.
00:49:21.792,00:49:25.462,is there a part of you that wants to ram it into my face?
00:49:27.339,00:49:30.676,"You know, considering your past?"
00:49:31.635,00:49:32.719,"Well, of course."
00:49:34.554,00:49:35.639,But then...
00:49:36.223,00:49:39.351,"you know, we wouldn't be able to have all the fun we're having."
00:49:40.977,00:49:42.145,That's interesting. I...
00:49:43.105,00:49:48.568,I think I always thought I was gonna die before I could share my work with anyone.
00:49:51.154,00:49:52.739,"But now, I have you."
00:49:55.409,00:49:56.451,Which is kind of cool.
00:50:06.712,00:50:08.004,Um...
00:50:08.672,00:50:10.799,Maybe a little bit. But I also...
00:50:10.882,00:50:13.218,"I feel like I am pretty fair to my victims. Like, I..."
00:50:13.301,00:50:15.721,I try to give them a warning as to what they are walking into.
00:50:15.804,00:50:18.306,"That's why I put stuff in the ad, like..."
00:50:19.141,00:50:20.851,Are you a fan of Interview with the Vampire?
00:50:20.934,00:50:23.061,"Like, I want them to know that I'm dangerous."
00:50:23.145,00:50:24.229,You know...
00:50:24.730,00:50:26.106,"Actually, there is this..."
00:50:26.606,00:50:28.859,"One of my latest was this big, old sweetie."
00:50:28.942,00:50:30.569,And I called him Buddy.
00:50:30.652,00:50:31.611,"And, um..."
00:50:32.279,00:50:36.491,I stuck an ax in a stump outside of the house I rented.
00:50:37.868,00:50:39.578,"He passed by it, he saw it."
00:50:40.162,00:50:43.206,"He came in anyway, and he stayed with me all night."
00:50:43.290,00:50:44.791,"You know. I mean, it's almost like..."
00:50:46.293,00:50:48.879,It's almost like... Like they wanna die.
00:50:51.631,00:50:52.674,Uh...
00:50:57.637,00:50:59.139,That's actually a brilliant idea.
00:50:59.222,00:51:01.516,I've never thought of that as a weapon before.
00:51:02.851,00:51:04.144,"But, alas, Sara."
00:51:04.895,00:51:07.606,I promised I wouldn't kill you. And I never lie.
00:51:08.106,00:51:09.357,Not in the cards for us.
00:51:13.111,00:51:16.281,"You said you would not kill me within the next 24 hours, so..."
00:51:21.578,00:51:22.996,Now why would you bring that up?
00:51:24.581,00:51:26.124,That only gets you into trouble.
00:51:44.684,00:51:45.644,The dishes.
00:51:47.687,00:51:49.272,What are you doing with my camera?
00:51:55.862,00:51:56.696,Sure.
00:52:01.201,00:52:03.245,"Just watch a deer, just..."
00:52:04.704,00:52:05.956,Just being a deer?
00:52:12.462,00:52:14.256,Put that away. That's my job.
00:52:22.472,00:52:23.723,Psst.
00:52:39.781,00:52:42.325,Where is Mommy's juice?
00:52:47.414,00:52:51.668,"Mommy is thirsty! Oh, yes!"
00:52:52.002,00:52:53.587,This better be a Coppola wine.
00:52:54.504,00:52:56.715,"Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Mm."
00:52:57.757,00:52:59.509,"Oh, that is nice. Thank you."
00:53:02.804,00:53:07.559,"Um, I am thinking about this really cool book that I once read called The Journalist and the Murderer."
00:53:08.977,00:53:10.770,"Oh, it's really great. You got to give it a read."
00:53:13.648,00:53:16.943,It's sort of about the moral quandary that journalists face.
00:53:17.027,00:53:21.865,"You know, uh, how they sometimes have to lie and ingratiate themselves with their subjects."
00:53:21.948,00:53:26.745,"You know, there's little flattery and a little flirtation to get the material they need."
00:53:27.454,00:53:28.371,"And, uh..."
00:53:29.039,00:53:33.668,I thought about it while I was watching a little show called Encounters.
00:53:38.298,00:53:39.966,"You didn't know I knew about that, did you?"
00:53:45.263,00:53:47.098,"Well, I know that you don't make wedding videos."
00:53:47.182,00:53:48.350,Um...
00:53:48.433,00:53:51.061,And I know you have a knife in your boot.
00:53:56.399,00:53:58.276,"Don't worry about it, okay? Look."
00:54:00.236,00:54:02.656,"Let's see. I don't think you have been lying here, traditionally."
00:54:02.739,00:54:04.115,"You know, I think you have been, uh..."
00:54:04.199,00:54:06.159,You've been playing around with the facts a little bit.
00:54:06.242,00:54:08.078,"But, look, everybody does that, okay?"
00:54:08.161,00:54:09.704,"Look, it's one of my favorite things to do."
00:54:09.788,00:54:10.830,It's what I do for a living.
00:54:10.914,00:54:16.378,"But while I do play around with facts, I never lie."
00:54:17.087,00:54:20.924,"My eyes, my heart, my soul, I always tell the truth."
00:54:21.591,00:54:25.053,"And that is the same kind of truth I have been feeling from you here today, so..."
00:54:25.845,00:54:30.225,"I want you to know, everything is okay, I'm not mad. Okay?"
00:54:34.062,00:54:37.107,"I'm gonna ask you a question, and I want you to answer me honestly."
00:54:39.109,00:54:41.236,Do you believe that I'm a serial killer?
00:54:46.992,00:54:48.326,Why not?
00:54:50.662,00:54:53.373,"First off, the stories you've been telling are ridiculous."
00:54:53.456,00:54:54.332,Okay.
00:54:58.586,00:55:06.177,"Like, if you were a killer, why would you invite me into your home, and have me film you confess all the details of all your murders."
00:55:06.261,00:55:09.097,"Like, what would stop me from going to the police with this?"
00:55:09.180,00:55:10.640,That's a fair point.
00:55:11.349,00:55:13.476,"It is a moot point, however."
00:55:14.310,00:55:16.229,You won't go to the police tomorrow.
00:55:16.813,00:55:19.858,"Because tomorrow, I'll be dead."
00:55:21.735,00:55:25.363,"Because tonight, you are going to kill me."
00:55:29.117,00:55:33.580,"I've thought about this. I'm very excited about it, okay?"
00:55:34.372,00:55:37.375,Why would I make my 40th film another random kill film?
00:55:37.459,00:55:39.294,"I've made 39 of those, okay?"
00:55:39.377,00:55:42.922,"Also, why would we make some stodgy, pedantic documentary?"
00:55:43.006,00:55:44.090,Plenty of those.
00:55:44.799,00:55:45.967,You know what we need?
00:55:47.260,00:55:48.636,A murder film.
00:55:49.345,00:55:53.558,Where the pupil fells the king.
00:55:53.641,00:55:55.435,That's the movie I wanna make.
00:55:59.064,00:56:03.860,Because I know you well enough to know that you will do anything to make a great piece of art.
00:56:05.320,00:56:14.037,And this will be \the most unbelievably exciting episode of Encounters that you can possibly imagine.
00:56:18.124,00:56:20.794,"I know, I just laid a lot on you, but I have a lot of experience with this."
00:56:20.877,00:56:22.545,I'm gonna ease you into it. I am super excited!
00:56:22.629,00:56:23.880,"-Aaron, what... -First things first!"
00:56:23.963,00:56:25.215,"Put that camera down, girl!"
00:56:38.645,00:56:39.771,"Here, give me the camera."
00:56:40.480,00:56:41.564,Okay.
00:56:42.565,00:56:45.610,Okay. Come with me. Let's go this way.
00:56:46.361,00:56:47.821,How are you with an ax?
00:56:51.074,00:56:52.242,Are you a leftie or a righty?
00:56:53.451,00:56:55.286,"You know, it does not matter. Just get into it."
00:56:55.370,00:56:59.249,"Okay, I am wearing a mask, so you do not have to look into my eyes when you kill me."
00:56:59.332,00:57:00.625,It's a little difficult.
00:57:00.708,00:57:03.002,"Imagine it's like a cartoon, like a funny noise."
00:57:03.086,00:57:06.798,"Also, I sharpened the ax, it should go straight through my neck."
00:57:06.881,00:57:08.883,There are very few bones. Let's do it!
00:57:11.469,00:57:15.890,You want me to take this ax and chop your head off with it?
00:57:19.144,00:57:21.771,Consider it an assisted suicide. It's totally cool.
00:57:29.696,00:57:30.530,Wait! Wait.
00:57:35.160,00:57:36.661,Okay. Go for it.
00:57:38.079,00:57:39.080,Whenever you're ready.
00:57:40.832,00:57:43.626,Just reach back and take a swing.
00:57:47.255,00:57:48.173,What's wrong?
00:57:57.432,00:57:58.558,Okey dokey.
00:57:59.476,00:58:02.103,"Okay. So, this is a much better idea."
00:58:02.187,00:58:03.938,I should have thought of this in the first place.
00:58:04.022,00:58:07.400,This is essentially going to turn this into a passive endeavor.
00:58:07.984,00:58:10.195,"What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna jump off the ledge."
00:58:10.278,00:58:13.490,"And unless you come and save me, I'm gonna die."
00:58:13.573,00:58:16.034,Which makes you complicit in the murder.
00:58:16.117,00:58:16.993,"Pretty cool, right?"
00:58:17.076,00:58:19.829,"I mean, obviously, not as cool as putting an ax through my neck."
00:58:19.913,00:58:22.499,"But, for a first timer, it will do."
00:58:23.541,00:58:24.542,"Are you ready, Sara?"
00:58:28.505,00:58:30.757,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
00:58:31.633,00:58:32.842,Pull yourself up.
00:58:33.760,00:58:34.677,Up!
00:58:38.765,00:58:41.392,Aaron? Aaron! Aaron!
00:58:48.233,00:58:49.484,Sara? Are you in here?
00:58:50.568,00:58:52.487,Hello? Where did you go?
00:58:56.282,00:59:01.663,"And I'm excited about it Hey. There you are. Okay, so..."
00:59:01.955,00:59:04.832,"Before sunrise, put the camera above us."
00:59:04.916,00:59:07.126,I play you Sara Loves Her Juicy Fruit...
00:59:09.671,00:59:10.880,What are you doing?
00:59:13.383,00:59:14.717,"Hey, are you leaving?"
00:59:17.345,00:59:18.221,"Oh, Jesus."
00:59:19.889,00:59:22.350,"Sara, did I freak you out -by hanging myself? -Fuck off."
00:59:24.644,00:59:25.937,"I said, fuck off."
00:59:29.941,00:59:31.025,I'm sorry.
00:59:31.985,00:59:33.361,Please don't go. Please.
00:59:33.444,00:59:36.072,Do you have any idea how fucked up that was?
00:59:38.950,00:59:40.535,I can't believe you put me in that position.
00:59:46.332,00:59:47.166,What is wrong with you?
00:59:50.920,00:59:52.797,Just promise me you won't leave. One second!
00:59:59.637,01:00:00.513,Please.
01:00:05.101,01:00:06.185,What the fuck is this?
01:00:16.613,01:00:19.324,It's what I was wearing underneath my shirt when I hanged myself.
01:00:19.907,01:00:26.247,"I connected a black wire to the harness, so I was hanging by my chest, and I wouldn't actually hang myself."
01:00:31.002,01:00:32.128,Look.
01:00:32.587,01:00:35.590,I am sorry it freaked you out. I thought...
01:00:37.008,01:00:39.302,"I don't know what I was thinking, I'm just..."
01:00:43.473,01:00:46.851,"Look, I'm not really good at this, okay? But I am just going to lay it out there."
01:00:48.478,01:00:51.356,"I really, really like you."
01:00:52.023,01:00:52.940,And...
01:00:53.775,01:00:55.777,I'm just trying to connect with you.
01:00:56.402,01:00:59.030,I'm not really doing a very good job.
01:01:00.615,01:01:02.742,"And I know you don't really wanna connect with me, so..."
01:01:03.826,01:01:05.870,"What I figured I would do, is..."
01:01:06.746,01:01:08.956,"Give you what I can give you, which is..."
01:01:16.923,01:01:22.011,"I can give you. I can be a fucked-up guy, and show you..."
01:01:23.763,01:01:27.350,everything that hopefully gives you what you want as an artist.
01:01:31.521,01:01:32.522,Look.
01:01:35.900,01:01:37.694,Am I a murderer?
01:01:38.903,01:01:39.737,No.
01:01:42.156,01:01:43.741,"Okay, of course, I'm not a murderer."
01:01:44.450,01:01:45.410,Am I a...
01:01:46.494,01:01:53.292,"sociopathic, pathological liar who is completely disconnected from the world and people?"
01:01:53.918,01:01:54.919,Yes.
01:01:58.923,01:02:02.927,Am I majorly connecting with you and having a fucking great time today?
01:02:03.010,01:02:08.516,"Because I get to just lie and be weird, like I really like to do?"
01:02:09.225,01:02:10.143,Yes!
01:02:10.226,01:02:14.021,I just... I really like you!
01:02:15.106,01:02:17.442,And I think you're incredible.
01:02:20.695,01:02:21.821,Thank you.
01:02:29.162,01:02:30.997,I think it will make a really good scene.
01:02:34.917,01:02:36.794,I'm sorry I freaked you out.
01:02:46.554,01:02:48.723,What kind of game are we playing?
01:02:50.475,01:02:51.350,It's called...
01:02:51.434,01:02:52.351,Uh...
01:02:52.435,01:02:55.480,Two Lies and a Truth.
01:02:55.563,01:02:57.023,Did you play this game in your castle?
01:02:57.106,01:02:58.399,"-Yeah. -Okay, good."
01:02:58.483,01:03:00.318,"-So, in Two Lies and a Truth, -Mm-hm."
01:03:00.401,01:03:03.821,"you're gonna tell three stories, and one of them will be true."
01:03:03.905,01:03:07.909,"-And none of that bullshit from your... -I got you, I got you."
01:03:07.992,01:03:10.912,-Facts that are technically correct. -Okay. All right.
01:03:11.454,01:03:12.622,"Two lies, one truth."
01:03:12.747,01:03:14.415,And I get to guess which one is the truth.
01:03:14.499,01:03:15.333,Okay.
01:03:18.920,01:03:20.963,I was born three months premature.
01:03:22.298,01:03:24.217,I have never slept with a woman.
01:03:26.302,01:03:29.430,I can hold my breath for two-and-a-half minutes.
01:03:29.514,01:03:30.515,Okay.
01:03:32.183,01:03:33.851,I think that it is...
01:03:34.185,01:03:36.229,The breath one.
01:03:36.312,01:03:37.355,It's number two.
01:03:41.150,01:03:42.985,You want me to be honest? It's number two.
01:03:46.364,01:03:50.243,-You're fucking with me. -I... I wish I was.
01:03:50.743,01:03:55.164,"Did it look like I was fucking with you when you came onto me in the hot tub, did it look like I knew what I was doing?"
01:03:56.290,01:03:57.750,It was just a weird...
01:03:58.626,01:04:00.127,series of events.
01:04:00.211,01:04:03.214,"I didn't have a normal childhood. You know, I, um..."
01:04:05.007,01:04:13.766,"I started to notice my chemistry was off, like, in those pre-teen years, and I have my first, sort of, like, psychotic break when I was, like, 14."
01:04:13.850,01:04:17.061,So I was in an institution until I was about 19.
01:04:17.144,01:04:19.480,And they did not really know how to properly medicate then.
01:04:20.064,01:04:24.110,"So, by the time I got out, I had to split with my family, and, um..."
01:04:25.987,01:04:30.283,"And I got a job as security, which was mostly older people, so I didn't really consort with people my age."
01:04:30.366,01:04:33.536,And I just missed... I just missed the boat.
01:04:33.619,01:04:34.620,I just missed it.
01:04:35.329,01:04:36.372,Um...
01:04:37.957,01:04:39.208,Have you had a girlfriend?
01:04:40.459,01:04:41.377,No.
01:04:42.962,01:04:43.963,I...
01:04:47.967,01:04:49.886,Have you ever seen that movie Never Been Kissed?
01:04:50.761,01:04:51.888,Yeah.
01:04:52.763,01:04:55.016,I should have written and directed that movie.
01:04:57.059,01:04:59.395,"-It's embarrassing. -No, it's not embarrassing."
01:04:59.687,01:05:02.273,-It's really embarrassing. -It's really weird.
01:05:03.107,01:05:04.525,But it's not embarrassing.
01:05:09.363,01:05:10.531,I don't know.
01:05:13.367,01:05:15.036,Do you wanna have your first kiss?
01:05:19.540,01:05:21.876,-Shut up. -It doesn't have to be a big deal.
01:05:23.544,01:05:25.338,-Really? -Yeah.
01:05:26.422,01:05:27.840,-You'd kiss me? -Yeah.
01:05:30.384,01:05:32.470,-Okay. -Okay.
01:05:35.222,01:05:36.265,Who makes the move?
01:05:52.198,01:05:53.449,That was cool.
01:06:06.921,01:06:08.547,for the climax of the episode.
01:06:11.968,01:06:12.969,You watch your head.
01:06:13.427,01:06:15.554,"All good things to those who wait, my dear."
01:06:17.640,01:06:18.766,Come this way.
01:06:23.688,01:06:24.689,Okay.
01:06:25.815,01:06:28.943,"All right, now. Before we get started, I do have a surprise for you."
01:06:29.235,01:06:30.486,But you have to close your eyes.
01:06:34.323,01:06:36.784,"I'm in the middle of nowhere, at night, with you."
01:06:36.867,01:06:40.079,"That's a very good point. Point taken, but it will be worth it."
01:06:45.376,01:06:46.210,All right.
01:06:53.634,01:06:54.635,Open them.
01:06:58.556,01:07:04.937,It's a symbol of my affection for you and of our amazing day we spent together.
01:07:05.187,01:07:07.314,"Sorry, there's a picture of me and another guy in there."
01:07:07.398,01:07:11.193,I did not have a chance to make one specifically for you.
01:07:11.277,01:07:12.486,You were a bit of a surprise.
01:07:20.453,01:07:21.328,Cool.
01:07:22.496,01:07:24.832,All right. It's time for part two.
01:07:32.465,01:07:33.674,I don't get it.
01:07:42.600,01:07:43.768,Bullshit.
01:07:47.021,01:07:48.397,When did you dig that?
01:07:48.481,01:07:49.815,I dug it before you got here.
01:07:49.899,01:07:53.819,I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be for me or for you.
01:07:54.653,01:07:56.363,But I think I finally figured it out.
01:08:00.326,01:08:01.660,Okay.
01:08:10.377,01:08:12.171,"No, no, no, no. It's yours."
01:08:12.797,01:08:16.133,I snuck it out of your boot after I fell on you.
01:08:16.217,01:08:18.010,I thought for sure you would have noticed that.
01:08:20.304,01:08:23.808,Are you ready for the grand finale of the episode?
01:08:24.767,01:08:26.769,-Okay. -Okay.
01:08:52.837,01:08:56.882,"We both stab each other, and we both crawl on the grave, and we die together, like Romeo and Juliet."
01:08:57.299,01:09:04.140,"And somebody will find the tapes, and release them, and it will be like... history together."
01:09:07.393,01:09:10.729,And you're afraid! Do not be afraid. I'm not gonna stab you.
01:09:10.813,01:09:14.150,Here. I love you too much. Take it. Take the knife.
01:09:15.067,01:09:15.901,You do it.
01:09:18.571,01:09:19.488,Come on.
01:09:20.823,01:09:21.782,Do it!
01:09:24.034,01:09:25.244,Come on.
01:09:32.126,01:09:34.211,Sara. Wait!
01:09:40.968,01:09:42.011,Sara!
01:09:43.470,01:09:44.305,Sara!
01:09:50.978,01:09:52.271,Sara!
01:09:54.648,01:09:55.482,Sara.
01:09:56.692,01:09:57.610,Sara.
01:10:05.993,01:10:07.119,Sara?
01:10:10.706,01:10:11.957,You're in the middle of nowhere.
01:10:14.835,01:10:16.045,"Come on, Sara."
01:10:20.507,01:10:22.218,I have the keys. There's nowhere to go.
01:10:43.989,01:10:44.865,Sara.
01:10:48.160,01:10:50.871,You got to finish the episode.
01:12:30.804,01:12:31.722,Oh.
01:13:18.185,01:13:19.019,So...
01:13:21.563,01:13:23.315,I don't think I'm gonna die tonight.
01:13:26.693,01:13:28.779,I kind of feel bad about it because...
01:13:30.531,01:13:32.908,It was my whole idea in the first place.
01:13:36.245,01:13:37.371,"But, Sara..."
01:13:42.376,01:13:43.502,You did it.
01:13:45.129,01:13:48.632,"You made a great, great episode."
01:13:50.175,01:13:51.635,You should be really proud of yourself.
01:13:56.223,01:13:58.308,I'm bummed that you're not gonna be here to see it.
01:14:02.563,01:14:05.065,It's kind of ironic because I never thought I was...
01:14:07.025,01:14:08.861,I really don't wanna kill again.
01:14:09.695,01:14:12.239,"That was real, and then, there was you."
01:14:13.157,01:14:14.116,My muse.
01:14:17.619,01:14:19.246,You inspired me.
01:14:22.583,01:14:23.709,My Coppola.
01:16:00.389,01:16:03.183,Brooklyn-bound A-train. The next stop is 34th Street.
01:16:03.267,01:16:04.851,"Stand clear of the closing doors, please."
