00:01:18.787,00:01:22.249,"COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER ON RADIO: Starfleet Base, we've sent you a transmission."
00:01:22.290,00:01:24.418,"WOMAN ON RADIO: Kelvin, have you double-checked those readings?"
00:01:24.459,00:01:25.669,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Our gravitational sensors are going crazy here.
00:01:25.711,00:01:27.295,You should see this.
00:01:27.337,00:01:29.048,It looks like a lightning storm.
00:01:29.088,00:01:31.425,WOMAN: What you've sent us doesn't seem possible.
00:01:31.466,00:01:33.092,"COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Yes, ma'am. I understand."
00:01:33.134,00:01:34.302,CAPTAIN ROBAU: Report.
00:01:33.134,00:01:36.137,OFFICER PITTS: It's still out of visual range.
00:01:36.179,00:01:38.682,MAN ON RADIO: Alert Captain Robau that Starfleet advises your ship to proceed with caution.
00:01:38.724,00:01:40.768,Polarize the viewscreen.
00:01:40.809,00:01:42.895,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Could whatever this is be of Klingon origin?
00:01:42.937,00:01:44.521,"Captain, we have visual."
00:01:44.563,00:01:45.856,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Repeat. Could this be Klingon?
00:01:45.898,00:01:47.106,"MAN ON RADIO: Negative, Lieutenant."

00:01:53.196,00:01:55.198,My God.
00:02:15.094,00:02:16.637,I have a reading.
00:02:16.678,00:02:18.472,They've locked weapons on us!
00:02:18.513,00:02:21.976,"Torpedo locked on us at 320 degrees, mark 2."
00:02:24.436,00:02:25.604,Evasive pattern Delta-five!
00:02:27.689,00:02:28.857,Incoming fast!
00:02:35.322,00:02:37.992,Fire all phasers!
00:02:38.033,00:02:41.703,CHIEF ENGINEER ON COMLINK: Warp drive's been knocked out!
00:02:41.745,00:02:44.456,Weapons are off-line.
00:02:44.498,00:02:45.624,They're firing another!
00:02:45.666,00:02:47.334,All power to forward shields!
00:02:55.342,00:02:56.510,Lieutenant!
00:03:01.389,00:03:03.684,HUMPHREY: Atmospheric stabilization has been lost.
00:03:03.725,00:03:05.519,Were our shields even up?
00:03:05.560,00:03:07.437,"We have confirmed casualties, sir."
00:03:07.479,00:03:09.481,Ten percent.
00:03:09.523,00:03:13.568,All remaining power to forward shields. Prepare shuttles for evacuation.

00:03:17.906,00:03:23.328,My commander requests the presence of your Captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire.
00:03:23.370,00:03:26.373,You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft.
00:03:26.414,00:03:28.917,Your refusal would be unwise.
00:03:41.262,00:03:42.764,Walk with me.
00:03:48.896,00:03:52.273,"If I don't report in 15 minutes, evacuate the crew."
00:03:52.315,00:03:55.027,"Sir, we could issue..."
00:03:55.069,00:03:56.319,Use autopilot.
00:03:57.821,00:04:00.323,And get off this ship.
00:04:00.365,00:04:02.409,"You're Captain now, Mr. Kirk."
00:05:15.482,00:05:17.567,His heart rate's elevated.
00:05:39.965,00:05:41.508,Look at this ship.
00:05:43.510,00:05:46.180,Are you familiar with this craft?
00:05:48.140,00:05:51.434,CAPTAIN ROBAU: Is it him?
00:05:51.476,00:05:56.190,Then ask Captain Nero what gives him the right to attack a Federation vessel.
00:06:09.452,00:06:12.371,Do you know the location of Ambassador Spock?
00:06:15.792,00:06:18.461,I'm unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.
00:06:20.088,00:06:22.716,What is the current stardate?
00:06:25.052,00:06:27.470,Twenty-two thirty-three zero-four.
00:06:29.388,00:06:30.724,Where are you from?
00:06:38.732,00:06:40.483,"Sir, they're locked on our signal."
00:06:40.525,00:06:42.110,Bravo-six maneuver!
00:06:52.495,00:06:55.374,MAN: Seventeen more out!
00:06:55.414,00:06:57.042,We're evacuating!

00:07:05.717,00:07:07.719,Get to your designated shuttlecraft.
00:07:07.761,00:07:09.596,That's George's voice.
00:07:09.637,00:07:11.556,You'll deliver in the shuttle.
00:07:17.062,00:07:21.108,Move! This one's closed!
00:07:21.149,00:07:24.069,I'm on my way!
00:07:24.111,00:07:26.196,George.
00:07:26.238,00:07:29.032,I have medical shuttle 37 standing by. Get to it now.
00:07:29.074,00:07:30.909,WINONA: Yes.
00:07:30.951,00:07:34.955,Do exactly as I say.
00:07:34.996,00:07:38.166,"Our baby, it's coming now."
00:07:44.256,00:07:46.507,COMPUTER: Autopilot function has been destroyed.
00:07:46.549,00:07:49.719,Manual operation only.
00:07:49.761,00:07:52.472,Clear those decks now!
00:07:52.513,00:07:55.267,MAN: Get to the hangar deck!
00:07:57.518,00:08:00.105,That was a big one.
00:08:00.147,00:08:02.899,"And the baby, too, right?"
00:08:08.280,00:08:10.407,MALE NURSE: Right here.
00:08:14.786,00:08:17.414,GEORGE ON COMLINK: Captain to shuttle 37.
00:08:17.456,00:08:20.083,"Yes, sir, she is."
00:08:20.125,00:08:23.086,"We're waiting on you, sir."
00:08:23.128,00:08:25.213,That's an order.
00:08:25.255,00:08:26.798,"No, wait!"
00:08:29.717,00:08:31.970,Please stop! Stop!
00:08:33.638,00:08:37.476,George?
00:08:37.517,00:08:39.644,"Sweetheart, listen to me."
00:08:39.686,00:08:41.271,I'm not gonna be there.
00:08:41.313,00:08:43.315,No.
00:08:43.357,00:08:46.234,still on the ship?
00:08:46.276,00:08:48.236,The shuttles will never make it if I don't fight them off.
00:08:48.278,00:08:51.406,"George, I can't do this without you."
00:08:51.448,00:08:53.908,"Okay, I need you to push now."
00:10:11.445,00:10:13.363,What is it?
00:10:13.405,00:10:14.614,A boy?
00:10:16.199,00:10:18.243,Tell me about him.
00:10:22.205,00:10:23.664,"George, you should be here."
00:10:25.292,00:10:28.962,COMPUTER: Impact alert.
00:10:29.003,00:10:32.924,What are we gonna call him?
00:10:32.966,00:10:35.802,You kidding me?
00:10:37.887,00:10:40.848,Let's name him after your dad.
00:10:43.059,00:10:46.229,Jim. Okay. Jim it is.
00:10:50.984,00:10:53.487,"Sweetheart, can you hear me?"
00:10:53.528,00:10:57.031,I love you so much.
00:12:15.276,00:12:17.696,"MAN ON PHONE: Hey, are you out of your mind?"
00:12:17.736,00:12:20.281,You think you can get away with this just 'cause your mother's off planet?
00:12:20.323,00:12:22.617,You get your ass back home now!
00:12:22.659,00:12:26.580,"You live in my house, buddy."
00:12:26.621,00:12:29.957,"You get one scratch on that car, and I'm gonna whip your..."
00:12:42.512,00:12:44.138,Yeah!
00:12:44.180,00:12:55.609,"I know you planned it This Watergate Hey, Johnny!"
00:12:55.650,00:13:17.088,and wonder why in my side it's a sabotage Citizen! Pull over.
00:13:19.215,00:13:24.512,'cause you can't say nothin' with a push of your button?
00:13:24.554,00:13:46.660,I'm out and I'm gone I keep it on and on you might not get No!
00:14:11.726,00:14:14.312,"Is there a problem, Officer?"
00:14:14.354,00:14:16.897,"Citizen, what is your name?"
00:14:16.939,00:14:19.150,My name is James Tiberius Kirk.
00:14:37.418,00:14:40.213,COMPUTER: What is the formula for the volume of a sphere?
00:14:40.254,00:14:42.507,Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
00:14:42.549,00:14:43.842,One-point-two-six.
00:14:43.883,00:14:45.552,An ellipse.
00:14:45.593,00:14:47.387,What is the electrical charge of an up-type quark?
00:14:47.428,00:14:49.222,VULCAN BOY: Positive two-thirds.
00:14:49.263,00:14:54.143,"What is the square root of 2,396,324?"
00:14:54.185,00:14:56.103,"1,548."
00:14:56.145,00:14:58.857,Dimensionality equals the logarithm and divided by...
00:14:58.898,00:15:02.736,Non-excludability and non-rivalry... Four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
00:15:02.777,00:15:05.780,When it is morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory.
00:15:09.534,00:15:10.702,Spock!
00:15:12.953,00:15:16.416,I presume you've prepared new insults for today.
00:15:16.457,00:15:17.625,Affirmative.
00:15:25.925,00:15:29.554,This is your thirty-fifth attempt to elicit an emotional response from me.
00:15:29.596,00:15:32.682,"You're neither human nor Vulcan, and therefore have no place in this universe."
00:15:32.724,00:15:35.643,Look. He has human eyes.
00:15:35.685,00:15:40.774,Perhaps an emotional response requires physical stimuli.
00:15:40.815,00:15:46.028,"He's a traitor, you know."
00:16:14.599,00:16:16.559,They called you a traitor.
00:16:21.606,00:16:24.400,Emotions run deep within our race.
00:16:24.442,00:16:27.361,"In many ways, more deeply than in humans."
00:16:27.403,00:16:31.407,Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience.
00:16:31.449,00:16:36.287,"The control of feelings, so that they do not control you."
00:16:39.540,00:16:45.421,"You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan, and yet, you married a human."
00:16:45.463,00:16:50.844,"As ambassador to Earth, it is my duty to observe and understand human behavior."
00:16:50.885,00:16:55.515,Marrying your mother was logical.
00:16:57.976,00:17:02.605,Spock. You are fully capable of deciding your own destiny.
00:17:04.315,00:17:09.028,"The question you face is, which path will you choose?"
00:17:10.446,00:17:13.199,This is something only you can decide.
00:17:18.663,00:17:21.541,"Spock, come here, let me see you."
00:17:23.584,00:17:26.128,SPOCK: No.
00:17:34.053,00:17:38.516,There's no need to be anxious.
00:17:38.558,00:17:40.852,"I am hardly anxious, Mother."
00:17:40.894,00:17:45.272,And fine has variable definitions.
00:17:45.314,00:17:46.482,Okay.
00:17:54.407,00:17:57.577,May I ask a personal query?
00:18:00.287,00:18:11.966,"Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr and purge all emotion, I trust you will not feel it reflects judgment upon you."
00:18:14.761,00:18:16.054,"Oh, Spock."
00:18:18.681,00:18:25.521,"As always, whatever you choose to be, you will have a proud mother."
00:18:29.984,00:18:33.988,You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors.
00:18:34.030,00:18:38.325,"Your final record is flawless, with one exception."
00:18:38.367,00:18:42.080,I see that you have applied to Starfleet as well.
00:18:42.121,00:18:44.665,It was logical to cultivate multiple options.
00:18:44.707,00:18:46.584,"Logical, but unnecessary."
00:18:46.626,00:18:49.796,You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
00:18:49.837,00:18:55.426,"It is truly remarkable, Spock, that you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage."
00:18:55.468,00:18:56.636,All rise!
00:19:00.431,00:19:07.105,"If you would clarify, Minister, to what disadvantage are you referring?"
00:19:12.526,00:19:15.321,"Council. Ministers, I must decline."
00:19:15.362,00:19:18.324,No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this Academy.
00:19:18.365,00:19:21.077,"Then as I am half human, your record remains untarnished."
00:19:21.119,00:19:24.831,"Spock, you have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan way."
00:19:24.872,00:19:27.333,Why did you come before this council today?
00:19:27.374,00:19:29.877,Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
00:19:29.919,00:19:34.007,The only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude.
00:19:34.048,00:19:37.468,"Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration."
00:19:39.386,00:19:41.388,Live long and prosper.
00:19:57.237,00:19:58.405,How are you?
00:20:03.036,00:20:04.578,WOMAN: Hi.
00:20:10.126,00:20:18.300,"Hi, I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, three Budweiser Classics, two Cardassian Sunrises and..."
00:20:18.342,00:20:19.677,Gotta try the Slusho.
00:20:19.719,00:20:21.512,The Slusho mix.
00:20:21.554,00:20:24.098,KIRK: That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
00:20:25.599,00:20:27.143,"And a shot of Jack, straight up."
00:20:27.185,00:20:28.769,Make that two.
00:20:28.811,00:20:30.897,Her shot's on her.
00:20:30.938,00:20:34.108,Don't you want to at least know my name before you completely reject me?
00:20:34.150,00:20:37.403,I'm fine without it.
00:20:37.444,00:20:39.197,It's Jim. Jim Kirk.
00:20:41.281,00:20:45.203,"If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up."
00:20:45.244,00:20:47.496,It's Uhura.
00:20:47.538,00:20:49.957,That's the name I was gonna make up for you.
00:20:49.999,00:20:52.501,Uhura what?
00:20:52.543,00:20:54.003,They don't have last names in your world?
00:20:54.045,00:20:55.671,Uhura is my last name.
00:20:55.713,00:20:58.674,"Well, they don't have first names in your world?"
00:20:59.717,00:21:01.844,"Excuse me, buddy."
00:21:01.886,00:21:04.764,"So, you're a cadet, you're studying."
00:21:04.805,00:21:07.474,Xenolinguistics.
00:21:07.516,00:21:12.813,The study of alien languages.
00:21:12.855,00:21:15.816,It means you've got a talented tongue.
00:21:15.858,00:21:17.526,I'm impressed.
00:21:17.568,00:21:24.700,"For a moment there, I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals."
00:21:26.202,00:21:28.370,"This townie isn't bothering you, right?"
00:21:28.412,00:21:30.915,Beyond belief.
00:21:30.957,00:21:33.042,You could handle me.
00:21:33.084,00:21:34.961,"Hey, you better mind your manners."
00:21:35.002,00:21:37.504,"Relax, cupcake."
00:21:37.546,00:21:42.218,"Hey, farm boy. Maybe you can't count, but there are four of us and one of you."
00:21:42.260,00:21:45.679,"So get some more guys, and then it'll be an even fight."
00:21:48.557,00:21:50.434,"UHURA: Guys, stop it."
00:21:53.187,00:21:54.438,Stop it!
00:22:16.127,00:22:17.419,Enough!
00:22:24.969,00:22:26.428,"Guys, he's had enough!"
00:22:31.267,00:22:34.520,"Outside, all of you."

00:22:37.523,00:22:39.525,CADET 1: I just bought a drink.
00:22:39.566,00:22:41.110,CADET 2: Can you believe this?
00:22:41.152,00:22:42.903,CADET 4: Come on.
00:22:42.945,00:22:46.824,"whistle really loud, you know that?"
00:22:46.866,00:22:49.451,"You know, I couldn't believe it when the bartender told me who you are."
00:22:49.493,00:22:52.538,"And who am I, Captain Pike?"
00:22:55.916,00:22:57.626,Can I get another one?
00:22:57.668,00:23:00.671,"For my dissertation, I was assigned the U.S.S. Kelvin."
00:23:00.713,00:23:04.800,"Something I admired about your dad, he didn't believe in no-win scenarios."
00:23:04.842,00:23:06.510,learned his lesson.
00:23:06.552,00:23:08.137,"Well, it depends on how you define winning."
00:23:08.179,00:23:10.556,"You're here, aren't you?"
00:23:10.597,00:23:13.726,"You know, that instinct to leap without looking, that was his nature, too."
00:23:13.767,00:23:15.978,"And in my opinion, it's something Starfleet's lost."
00:23:16.020,00:23:18.981,"talking to me, man?"
00:23:16.020,00:23:21.608,'Cause I looked up your file while you were drooling on the floor.
00:23:21.650,00:23:25.654,Your aptitude tests are off the charts.
00:23:25.696,00:23:28.241,You like being the only genius-level repeat-offender in the Midwest?
00:23:28.282,00:23:30.284,Maybe I love it.
00:23:30.326,00:23:34.038,So your dad dies.
00:23:34.080,00:23:37.875,Or do you feel like you were meant for something better?
00:23:37.917,00:23:39.710,Something special?
00:23:41.587,00:23:45.591,Enlist in Starfleet.
00:23:45.632,00:23:48.177,You guys must be way down on your recruiting quota for the month.
00:23:48.219,00:23:52.848,"If you're half the man your father was, Jim, Starfleet could use you."
00:23:52.890,00:23:58.062,You can be an officer in four years. You can have your own ship in eight.
00:23:58.104,00:24:01.065,"You understand what the Federation is, don't you? It's important."
00:24:01.107,00:24:03.067,It's a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada...
00:24:03.109,00:24:06.153,Are we done?
00:24:10.991,00:24:14.995,Riverside Shipyard.
00:24:18.999,00:24:23.170,"Now, your father was captain of a starship for 12 minutes."
00:24:23.212,00:24:27.674,"He saved 800 lives, including your mother's."
00:24:29.218,00:24:31.095,I dare you to do better.
00:25:56.180,00:25:57.390,"Nice ride, man."
00:26:01.519,00:26:03.603,It's yours.
00:26:03.645,00:26:06.148,Four years?
00:26:21.830,00:26:23.457,"At ease, gentlemen."
00:26:42.435,00:26:44.144,Never did get that first name.
00:26:44.186,00:26:46.313,FLIGHT OFFICER: You need a doctor.
00:26:46.355,00:26:48.107,"McCOY: I told you people, I don't need a doctor, damn it, I am a doctor!"
00:26:48.148,00:26:49.567,You need to get back to your seat.
00:26:49.607,00:26:51.485,I had one in the bathroom with no windows.
00:26:51.527,00:26:53.028,You need to get back to your seat now.
00:26:53.070,00:26:55.239,It means fear of dying in something that flies.
00:26:55.281,00:26:58.284,"Sir, for your own safety, sit down, or else I'll make you sit down!"
00:27:00.494,00:27:03.497,Fine.
00:27:03.539,00:27:07.293,PIKE ON PA: This is Captain Pike. We've been cleared for takeoff.
00:27:07.334,00:27:08.919,I may throw up on you.
00:27:08.961,00:27:11.380,I think these things are pretty safe.
00:27:11.422,00:27:13.715,"Don't pander to me, kid."
00:27:11.422,00:27:16.218,One tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in 13 seconds.
00:27:16.260,00:27:19.138,"A solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats."
00:27:19.179,00:27:22.182,And wait till you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles.
00:27:22.224,00:27:25.685,See if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding.
00:27:25.727,00:27:29.273,Space is disease and danger wrapped in darkness and silence.
00:27:29.315,00:27:33.152,"Well, I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space."
00:27:33.193,00:27:35.362,nowhere else to go.
00:27:35.404,00:27:38.656,The ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce.
00:27:38.698,00:27:40.742,All I got left is my bones.
00:27:46.123,00:27:50.043,Jim Kirk.
00:28:37.550,00:28:41.220,ROMULAN CREWMAN: Captain Nero!
00:28:41.261,00:28:42.971,Ayel says it's time.
00:28:48.185,00:28:53.399,"Sir, we've arrived at the coordinates you calculated."
00:28:53.440,00:28:56.485,What are your orders?
00:28:56.527,00:29:03.867,"We wait for the one who allowed our home to be destroyed, as we've been doing for 25 years."
00:29:03.909,00:29:07.120,And once we've killed him?
00:29:07.162,00:29:10.666,I'm not gonna kill him.
00:29:25.138,00:29:26.515,Capture that ship!
00:29:28.141,00:29:29.768,"Welcome back, Spock."
00:29:33.272,00:29:35.482,McCOY: Why are you so happy?
00:29:35.524,00:29:37.568,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:29:37.610,00:29:39.695,"Hello, ladies!"
00:29:39.737,00:29:41.363,I'm taking the test again.
00:29:41.405,00:29:43.156,"Yeah, tomorrow morning, and I want you there."
00:29:43.198,00:29:46.452,"You know, I've got better things to do than watch you embarrass yourself for a third time."
00:29:46.493,00:29:48.704,"I'm a doctor, Jim."
00:29:48.746,00:29:50.539,"Bones, it doesn't bother you that no one's ever passed the test?"
00:29:50.581,00:29:53.500,"Jim, it's the Kobayashi Maru."
00:29:53.542,00:29:56.462,"And no one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds."
00:29:56.503,00:29:58.756,I gotta study.
00:29:58.797,00:30:00.507,"Study, my ass."
00:30:03.636,00:30:08.766,"Jim, I think I love you."
00:30:08.807,00:30:11.351,Lights.
00:30:11.393,00:30:12.978,"Did you just say, That is so weird?"
00:30:13.019,00:30:14.938,"Yeah, I did, but..."
00:30:14.980,00:30:16.482,"Oh, my God, my roommate!"
00:30:16.523,00:30:18.108,But I thought you said she was gone for the night.
00:30:18.150,00:30:19.818,Obviously she's not.
00:30:19.859,00:30:21.403,Under...
00:30:21.445,00:30:22.988,She can't see you here.
00:30:23.029,00:30:24.823,Why not?
00:30:23.029,00:30:26.575,Because I promised her I'd stop bringing guys back to the room.
00:30:26.617,00:30:28.786,"Well, how many guys have you..."
00:30:31.204,00:30:32.331,Hey.
00:30:32.372,00:30:34.374,How are you?
00:30:34.416,00:30:36.585,"UHURA: The strangest thing, I was in the long-range sensor lab..."
00:30:36.627,00:30:38.796,"Yeah, I thought all night."
00:30:38.837,00:30:43.383,I was tracking solar systems and I picked up an emergency transmission.
00:30:43.425,00:30:46.928,Really?
00:30:46.970,00:30:48.597,No.
00:30:48.639,00:30:51.391,A Klingon armada was destroyed.
00:30:51.433,00:30:54.353,So you're not going back to the lab tonight?
00:30:58.315,00:30:59.941,"Gaila, who is he?"
00:30:59.983,00:31:02.528,The mouth-breather hiding under your bed.
00:31:02.569,00:31:03.945,You could hear me breathing?
00:31:03.987,00:31:05.614,You!
00:31:05.656,00:31:08.659,You're gonna fail.
00:31:08.701,00:31:10.285,"If I pass, will you tell me your first name?"
00:31:10.327,00:31:12.120,No! Good night.
00:31:10.327,00:31:14.581,I think the fact that you picked up a transmission is very interesting.
00:31:16.667,00:31:20.295,We are receiving a distress signal from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru.
00:31:20.337,00:31:22.381,The ship has lost power and is stranded.
00:31:22.422,00:31:24.341,Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them.
00:31:24.383,00:31:30.681,"Starfleet Command has ordered us to rescue them, Captain."
00:31:30.723,00:31:35.769,McCOY: Two Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral Zone and are locking weapons on us.
00:31:35.811,00:31:38.522,That's okay?
00:31:38.564,00:31:40.566,"TEST ADMINISTRATOR: Did he say, Don't worry about it?"
00:31:40.607,00:31:42.735,Is he not taking the simulation seriously?
00:31:42.776,00:31:45.738,McCOY: Three more Klingon warbirds decloaking and targeting our ship.
00:31:45.779,00:31:48.782,I don't suppose this is a problem either.
00:31:48.824,00:31:52.745,Alert Medical Bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship.
00:31:52.786,00:31:57.541,"And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons, Captain?"
00:31:57.583,00:31:59.835,Alert Medical.
00:32:01.420,00:32:03.881,Our ship is being hit.
00:32:03.922,00:32:06.091,I understand.
00:32:03.922,00:32:07.760,"Well, should we, I don't know, fire back?"
00:32:07.801,00:32:10.011,No.
00:32:17.060,00:32:19.396,What is this?
00:32:21.231,00:32:22.941,Hmm.
00:32:22.982,00:32:25.193,Arm photons.
00:32:25.235,00:32:27.362,"Yes, sir."
00:32:27.404,00:32:29.155,Are they?
00:32:30.365,00:32:32.367,No. They're not.
00:32:32.409,00:32:34.160,Fire on all enemy ships.
00:32:34.202,00:32:36.830,One photon each should do.
00:32:36.872,00:32:39.708,Target locked and acquired on all warbirds. Firing.
00:32:44.922,00:32:46.172,"All ships destroyed, Captain."
00:32:46.214,00:32:47.883,Begin rescue of the stranded crew.
00:32:47.925,00:32:58.310,"So! We've managed to eliminate all enemy ships, no one onboard was injured, and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway."
00:33:02.856,00:33:05.567,How the hell did that kid beat your test?
00:33:08.487,00:33:10.906,I do not know.
00:33:10.948,00:33:14.326,ACADEMY PRESIDENT: This session has been called to resolve a troubling matter.
00:33:14.367,00:33:16.369,"James T. Kirk, step forward."
00:33:18.371,00:33:28.715,"Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting that you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to Regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code."
00:33:28.757,00:33:33.052,"Is there anything you care to say before we begin, sir?"
00:33:33.094,00:33:36.765,"Yes, I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly."
00:33:40.936,00:33:43.104,"ACADEMY PRESIDENT: Step forward, please."
00:33:43.146,00:33:47.400,This is Commander Spock.
00:33:47.442,00:33:51.363,He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru exam for the last four years.
00:33:53.072,00:33:56.159,Commander?
00:33:53.072,00:34:02.415,"Cadet Kirk, you somehow managed to install and activate a subroutine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test."
00:34:02.457,00:34:05.544,Your point being?
00:34:07.671,00:34:12.050,ask you something I think we all know the answer to.
00:34:12.091,00:34:14.386,"The test itself is a cheat, isn't it?"
00:34:14.427,00:34:16.471,"I mean, you programmed it to be unwinnable."
00:34:16.513,00:34:19.307,Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario.
00:34:19.349,00:34:21.351,I don't believe in no-win scenarios.
00:34:21.393,00:34:24.980,"Then not only did you violate the rules, you also failed to understand the principal lesson."
00:34:25.022,00:34:26.606,"Please, enlighten me."
00:34:26.648,00:34:31.194,"You of all people should know, Cadet Kirk, a captain cannot cheat death."
00:34:33.488,00:34:35.490,I of all people?
00:34:35.532,00:34:40.579,"Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, assumed command of his vessel before being killed in action, did he not?"
00:34:40.620,00:34:42.539,I don't think you like the fact that I beat your test.
00:34:42.581,00:34:44.833,"Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test."
00:34:44.875,00:34:49.170,Enlighten me again.
00:34:44.875,00:34:51.423,"The purpose is to experience fear, fear in the face of certain death."
00:34:51.464,00:34:55.468,"To accept that fear, and maintain control of oneself and one's crew."
00:34:55.510,00:34:58.972,This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
00:35:01.767,00:35:03.101,"MESSENGER: Excuse me, sir."
00:35:09.608,00:35:12.360,We've received a distress call from Vulcan.
00:35:12.402,00:35:19.826,"With our primary fleet engaged in the Laurentian system, I hereby order all cadets to report to Hangar One immediately. Dismissed."
00:35:26.249,00:35:28.167,Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
00:35:28.209,00:35:30.295,"I don't know, but I like him."
00:35:34.466,00:35:37.803,"BARRACK LEADER 1: Fugeman, Regula One!"
00:35:37.844,00:35:41.264,"McCoy, U.S.S. Enterprise!"
00:35:41.306,00:35:44.643,"Rader, U.S.S. Hood."
00:35:47.062,00:35:49.731,He didn't call my name.
00:35:49.773,00:35:54.444,Commander?
00:35:54.486,00:35:56.237,"Kirk, you're on academic suspension."
00:35:56.279,00:35:58.698,That means you're grounded until the Academy Board rules.
00:35:58.740,00:36:00.533,"BARRACK LEADER 2: All right, listen up!"
00:36:00.575,00:36:02.828,"I'm gonna read this list one time, and one time only!"
00:36:02.869,00:36:06.915,"Jim, the Board will rule in your favor."
00:36:08.708,00:36:12.378,I gotta go.
00:36:12.420,00:36:14.255,"Yeah, you go."
00:36:22.014,00:36:24.223,Excuse me.
00:36:29.146,00:36:30.355,Damn it.
00:36:33.025,00:36:36.319,Come with me.
00:36:36.361,00:36:40.239,"Petrovsky, U.S.S. Antares!"
00:36:43.618,00:36:46.454,"Bones, where are we going?"
00:36:48.581,00:36:50.375,"Commander, a word?"
00:36:50.416,00:36:52.711,Was I not one of your top students?
00:36:52.752,00:37:04.097,"And did I not on multiple occasions demonstrate an exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, an unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies in subspace transmissions tests?"
00:37:04.139,00:37:09.477,"And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire is to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I'm assigned to the Farragut?"
00:37:09.519,00:37:12.522,It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
00:37:12.564,00:37:15.108,No. I'm assigned to the Enterprise.
00:37:19.445,00:37:22.490,"Yes, I believe you are."
00:37:22.532,00:37:24.450,What are you doing?
00:37:24.492,00:37:26.578,"I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pathetic."
00:37:26.619,00:37:33.626,Take a seat. I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.
00:37:33.668,00:37:36.004,To give you the symptoms.
00:37:36.046,00:37:38.006,You're gonna start to lose vision in your left eye.
00:37:38.048,00:37:40.008,"Yeah, I already have."
00:37:40.050,00:37:42.510,"Oh, and you're gonna get a really bad headache and a flop sweat."
00:37:42.552,00:37:44.930,You call this a favor?
00:37:47.015,00:37:51.519,"Kirk, James T. He is not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise."
00:37:51.561,00:37:58.359,"Medical code states the treatment and transport of a patient is to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me."
00:37:58.401,00:38:00.570,So I'm taking Mr. Kirk aboard.
00:38:00.612,00:38:07.827,Or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its senior medical officers?
00:38:07.869,00:38:11.414,As you were.
00:38:29.266,00:38:34.020,I might throw up on you.
00:38:34.062,00:38:35.230,"Jim, look."
00:38:35.272,00:38:36.439,Look.
00:39:32.787,00:39:37.209,We need to get you changed.
00:39:37.250,00:39:39.002,"Hell, it's that pointy-eared bastard."
00:39:56.811,00:39:59.605,PIKE: Mr. Spock.
00:39:59.647,00:40:02.692,Engineering reports ready for launch.
00:40:02.734,00:40:08.573,"Ladies and gentlemen, the maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today."
00:40:08.614,00:40:13.703,Her christening will just have to be our reward for a safe return. Carry on.
00:40:13.745,00:40:15.830,"All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare for immediate departure."
00:40:15.872,00:40:17.582,"Helm, thrusters."
00:40:17.623,00:40:19.709,"Moorings retracted, Captain."
00:40:19.751,00:40:21.920,Thrusters fired.
00:40:31.804,00:40:35.141,"The fleet's cleared spacedock, Captain."
00:40:35.183,00:40:40.563,Set a course for Vulcan.
00:40:40.605,00:40:43.608,Maximum warp.
00:40:59.916,00:41:01.834,"Lieutenant, where is Helmsman McKenna?"
00:41:01.876,00:41:04.921,"He has lungworms, sir."
00:41:04.963,00:41:06.547,I'm Hikaru Sulu.
00:41:06.589,00:41:09.842,"And you are a pilot, right?"
00:41:09.884,00:41:13.430,I'm not sure what's wrong here.
00:41:13.471,00:41:17.475,Is the parking brake on?
00:41:17.516,00:41:21.646,Have you disengaged the external inertial dampener?
00:41:24.607,00:41:26.692,"Ready for warp, sir."
00:41:33.825,00:41:35.910,Where are we?
00:41:35.952,00:41:37.829,This isn't worth it.
00:41:37.870,00:41:39.580,Hi! How are you?
00:41:39.622,00:41:41.499,My mouth is itchy.
00:41:41.540,00:41:43.376,"Well, those symptoms won't last long."
00:41:43.418,00:41:45.003,I'm going to give you a mild sedative.
00:41:45.044,00:41:46.379,I didn't know you.
00:41:46.421,00:41:48.340,Don't be such an infant.
00:41:49.674,00:41:51.926,How long is it supposed to...
00:41:51.968,00:41:54.387,Unbelievable.
00:41:54.429,00:41:55.847,"Engines at maximum warp, Captain."
00:41:55.888,00:41:57.098,"PIKE: Russian whiz kid, what's your name?"
00:41:57.140,00:41:58.975,Chanko? Cherpov?
00:41:59.017,00:42:01.227,"Ensign Chekov, Pavel Andreievich, sir."
00:42:01.269,00:42:03.021,"Fine, Chekov, Pavel Andreievich."
00:42:03.062,00:42:04.772,Begin ship-wide mission broadcast.
00:42:04.814,00:42:07.400,"Yes, sir. Happy to."

00:42:22.332,00:42:25.584,"May I have your attention, please?"
00:42:25.626,00:42:30.965,"At 2200 hours, telemetry detected an anomaly in the Neutral Zone."
00:42:31.007,00:42:34.552,What appeared to be a lightning storm in space.
00:42:34.593,00:42:43.436,"Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal from the Vulcan High Command that their planet was experiencing seismic activity."
00:42:43.478,00:42:51.361,Our mission is to assess the condition of Vulcan and assist in evacuations if necessary.
00:42:51.403,00:42:55.698,We should be arriving at Vulcan within three minutes.
00:42:57.575,00:43:02.663,Lightning storm.
00:43:03.831,00:43:06.125,"Good God, man."
00:43:08.127,00:43:11.089,What the hell's this?
00:43:11.130,00:43:13.591,"Nurse Chapel, I need 50 cc's of cortisone!"
00:43:13.632,00:43:15.676,"NURSE: Yes, sir!"
00:43:17.178,00:43:20.306,...appeared to be a lightning storm in space.
00:43:20.348,00:43:23.017,Hey!
00:43:23.059,00:43:27.021,Jim! I'm not kidding!
00:43:27.063,00:43:28.981,locate crew member Uhura.
00:43:29.023,00:43:30.691,"You know, I haven't seen a reaction this severe since med school."
00:43:30.733,00:43:34.320,We're flying into a trap!
00:43:35.238,00:43:36.822,Stop it!
00:43:45.498,00:43:47.375,Uhura! Uhura...
00:43:47.417,00:43:49.419,The transmission from the Klingon prison planet. What exactly...
00:43:49.461,00:43:51.463,"Oh, my God, what's wrong with your hands?"
00:43:51.504,00:43:53.506,"It's... Look, who is responsible for the Klingon attack?"
00:43:53.548,00:43:55.007,What?
00:43:55.049,00:43:56.842,Was the ship what?
00:43:56.884,00:43:58.844,What's happening to my mouth?
00:43:58.886,00:44:01.013,I can fix that.
00:44:01.055,00:44:03.057,Was the ship what?
00:44:03.099,00:44:04.934,What? I...
00:44:04.976,00:44:06.227,Romulan?
00:44:06.269,00:44:07.479,Yes.
00:44:42.347,00:44:45.642,Prod Nero.
00:44:47.560,00:44:48.811,McCOY: Jim!
00:44:48.853,00:44:50.980,"Jim, come back!"
00:44:51.022,00:44:52.607,KIRK: Captain!
00:44:52.649,00:44:53.941,...we have to stop the ship!
00:44:52.649,00:44:55.401,"Kirk, how the hell did you get onboard the Enterprise?"
00:44:55.443,00:44:59.113,"Captain, this man's under the influence of a severe reaction to a vaccine."
00:44:59.155,00:45:00.739,"He's completely delusional, and I take full responsibility."
00:45:00.781,00:45:02.200,Vulcan is not experiencing a natural disaster.
00:45:02.241,00:45:04.494,It's being attacked by Romulans.
00:45:04.536,00:45:06.912,"Romulans? Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough attention for one day."
00:45:06.954,00:45:08.373,"McCoy, take him back to medical."
00:45:08.414,00:45:10.124,We'll have words later.
00:45:10.166,00:45:12.084,"Look, sir, that same anomaly that we saw today..."
00:45:12.126,00:45:13.878,"Mr. Kirk is not cleared to be aboard this vessel, Captain."
00:45:13.919,00:45:15.838,I get it.
00:45:15.880,00:45:17.173,I'd love to do it again.
00:45:17.215,00:45:18.841,I can remove the cadet...
00:45:18.883,00:45:20.759,Kirk...
00:45:20.801,00:45:22.761,By recommending a full stop mid-warp during a rescue mission?
00:45:22.803,00:45:24.347,It's not a rescue mission.
00:45:24.389,00:45:28.226,Based on what facts?
00:45:28.267,00:45:36.150,"That same anomaly, a lightning storm in space that we saw today, also occurred on the day of my birth, before a Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin."
00:45:36.192,00:45:38.319,"You know that, sir, I read your dissertation."
00:45:38.361,00:45:42.657,"That ship, which had formidable and advanced weaponry, was never seen or heard from again."
00:45:42.699,00:45:47.662,"The Kelvin attack took place on the edge of Klingon space, and at 2300 hours last night, there was an attack."
00:45:47.704,00:45:54.544,"Forty-seven Klingon warbirds destroyed by Romulans, sir, and it was reported that the Romulans were in one ship, one massive ship."
00:45:54.586,00:45:57.296,And you know of this Klingon attack how?
00:45:59.798,00:46:03.386,"Sir, I intercepted and translated the message myself."
00:46:03.428,00:46:06.055,Kirk's report is accurate.
00:46:06.097,00:46:09.892,"The Romulans are waiting for us, I promise you that."
00:46:09.934,00:46:12.520,The cadet's logic is sound.
00:46:12.562,00:46:14.647,And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in xenolinguistics.
00:46:14.689,00:46:16.608,We would be wise to accept her conclusion.
00:46:16.649,00:46:19.652,Scan Vulcan space.
00:46:19.694,00:46:23.197,"Sir, I'm not sure I can distinguish the Romulan language from Vulcan."
00:46:23.239,00:46:25.283,What about you?
00:46:25.324,00:46:26.867,Uhura.
00:46:26.909,00:46:29.704,"Uhura, relieve the lieutenant."
00:46:29.746,00:46:31.830,"PIKE: Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman."
00:46:31.872,00:46:36.669,"All the other ships are out of warp, sir, and have arrived at Vulcan, but we seem to have lost all contact."
00:46:36.711,00:46:41.382,"Sir, I pick up no Romulan transmission, or transmission of any kind in the area."
00:46:41.424,00:46:43.968,It's because they're being attacked.
00:46:47.846,00:46:49.724,Shields up.
00:46:51.684,00:46:54.479,SULU: Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds.
00:46:54.520,00:46:57.231,"Four, three, two..."
00:46:59.024,00:47:00.443,Emergency evasive!
00:47:09.201,00:47:10.787,PIKE: Damage report!
00:47:10.827,00:47:12.871,PIKE: All stations!
00:47:23.132,00:47:24.883,Full reverse.
00:47:24.925,00:47:26.469,"Drop us down underneath them, Sulu."
00:47:45.571,00:47:47.532,"Sir, there's another Federation ship!"
00:47:47.573,00:47:49.367,"Destroy it, too."
00:47:49.408,00:47:51.369,"Captain, they're locking torpedoes."
00:47:51.410,00:47:53.579,Divert auxiliary power from port nacelles to forward shields.
00:48:01.546,00:48:04.256,"PIKE: Sulu, status report."
00:48:04.298,00:48:06.425,"Their weapons are powerful, sir. We can't take another hit like that."
00:48:06.467,00:48:08.469,Get me Starfleet Command.
00:48:08.511,00:48:12.931,"Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered some kind of high-energy pulse device into the Vulcan atmosphere."
00:48:12.973,00:48:16.477,Its signal appears to be blocking our communications and transporter abilities.
00:48:16.519,00:48:17.812,Prepare to fire all weapons.
00:48:22.400,00:48:25.403,ROMULAN OFFICER: Weapons ready.
00:48:25.444,00:48:27.864,The hull. Magnify.
00:48:32.827,00:48:34.911,"Captain, we're being hailed."
00:48:36.038,00:48:37.206,Hello.
00:48:39.166,00:48:42.086,I'm Captain Christopher Pike.
00:48:42.127,00:48:44.129,"Hi, Christopher."
00:48:44.171,00:48:46.215,You've declared war against the Federation.
00:48:46.257,00:48:52.680,"Withdraw, I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral location."
00:48:52.722,00:48:55.725,We stand apart.
00:48:55.767,00:48:59.645,As does your Vulcan crew member.
00:49:02.440,00:49:05.192,"Pardon me, I do not believe that you and I are acquainted."
00:49:05.234,00:49:08.863,"No, we're not. Not yet."
00:49:08.905,00:49:11.741,"Spock, there's something I would like you to see."
00:49:13.576,00:49:17.747,"Captain Pike, your transporter has been disabled."
00:49:17.789,00:49:22.167,"As you can see by the rest of your armada, you have no choice."
00:49:22.209,00:49:26.839,You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for negotiations.
00:49:26.881,00:49:28.340,That is all.
00:49:37.475,00:49:39.602,He'll kill you. You know that.
00:49:39.644,00:49:42.480,"Captain, we gain nothing by diplomacy. Going over to that ship is a mistake."
00:49:42.521,00:49:44.315,"I, too, agree."
00:49:44.356,00:49:46.609,I understand that.
00:49:46.651,00:49:50.028,I need officers who've been trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat.
00:49:50.070,00:49:53.990,"I have training, sir."
00:49:54.032,00:49:56.702,"Kirk, you, too."
00:49:56.744,00:49:59.330,"Chekov, you have the conn."
00:50:20.267,00:50:22.144,Prepare the red matter.
00:50:23.688,00:50:24.856,"Yes, sir."
00:51:03.435,00:51:07.899,"PIKE: Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, we can't assist Vulcan, we can't do our job."
00:51:07.940,00:51:13.362,"Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu, Engineer Olson will space-jump from the shuttle."
00:51:13.404,00:51:18.701,You will land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear.
00:51:16.072,00:51:20.578,"You'll get inside, you'll disable it, then you'll beam back to the ship."
00:51:20.619,00:51:24.456,"Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of the Enterprise."
00:51:24.498,00:51:29.837,"Once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact Starfleet and report what the hell's going on here."
00:51:29.879,00:51:33.674,"And if all else fails, fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the Laurentian system."
00:51:33.716,00:51:35.175,"Kirk, I'm promoting you to first officer."
00:51:35.217,00:51:37.177,What?
00:51:37.219,00:51:40.014,"Please, I apologize, the complexities of human pranks escape me."
00:51:40.056,00:51:45.603,"It's not a prank, Spock."
00:51:45.644,00:51:46.979,Let's go.
00:51:50.066,00:51:52.526,"KIRK: Sir, after we knock out that drill, what happens to you?"
00:51:52.568,00:51:54.820,"Well, I guess you'll have to come and get me."
00:51:54.862,00:51:57.406,"Careful with the ship, Spock, she's brand new."
00:52:08.793,00:52:10.586,"Dr. Puri, report."
00:52:10.628,00:52:12.337,It's McCoy.
00:52:15.299,00:52:18.510,Then you have just inherited his responsibility as chief medical officer.
00:52:18.552,00:52:21.305,"Yeah, tell me something I don't know."
00:52:21.346,00:52:23.766,"MAN 1: Shuttle 37, you're clear forward!"
00:52:23.808,00:52:27.227,"MAN 2 ON COMLINK: Shuttle 89, U.S.S. Enterprise, you are clear forward."
00:52:27.269,00:52:30.314,Interval check shows positive and steady.
00:52:30.355,00:52:32.483,"You got the charges, right?"
00:52:32.524,00:52:35.360,I can't wait to kick some Romulan ass.
00:52:35.402,00:52:37.195,Yeah.
00:52:41.075,00:52:44.453,"TRAFFIC CONTROLLER ON COMLINK: Shuttle command, we advise you activate your shields now."
00:52:56.882,00:52:58.884,So what kind of combat training do you have?
00:52:58.926,00:53:00.344,Fencing.
00:53:03.555,00:53:04.807,Pre-jump.
00:53:09.269,00:53:12.606,"Shuttle commander, you are clear from U.S.S. Enterprise airspace."
00:53:18.988,00:53:20.990,"PIKE ON COMLINK: Gentlemen, we're approaching the drop zone."
00:53:21.032,00:53:24.160,We have one shot to land on that platform.
00:53:24.200,00:53:27.245,"They may have defenses, so pull your chute as late as possible."
00:53:27.287,00:53:30.290,"Three, two, one."
00:53:32.126,00:53:35.796,"Remember, the Enterprise won't be able to beam you back until you turn off that drill."
00:53:37.715,00:53:38.883,Good luck.
00:54:00.988,00:54:03.490,"Away team is entering the atmosphere, sir."
00:54:03.532,00:54:04.992,Twenty thousand meters.
00:54:29.600,00:54:31.936,"Approaching the platform at 5,800 meters."
00:54:31.977,00:54:35.940,Kirk to Enterprise.
00:54:38.734,00:54:40.694,Forty-six hundred meters from the platform.
00:54:40.736,00:54:42.196,Forty-five hundred meters to target.

00:54:47.993,00:54:50.079,Two thousand meters.
00:54:55.918,00:54:59.463,Two thousand meters!
00:54:59.504,00:55:02.466,"No, not yet! Not yet!"
00:55:02.507,00:55:06.302,"Olson, open your chute!"
00:55:06.344,00:55:07.930,One thousand meters!
00:55:13.477,00:55:15.104,No!
00:55:20.567,00:55:22.360,Olson!
00:55:22.402,00:55:24.155,"Olson is gone, sir!"
00:55:44.591,00:55:46.177,"Kirk has landed, sir."
00:57:50.050,00:57:52.552,Give me your hand!
00:57:58.892,00:58:01.561,Olson had the charges.
00:58:01.603,00:58:02.813,I know.
00:58:05.190,00:58:07.401,SULU: What do we do?
00:58:19.830,00:58:23.292,The jamming signal's gone.
00:58:23.334,00:58:25.169,"Transporter control is reengaged, sir."
00:58:25.210,00:58:26.920,"Chekov, run gravitational sensors."
00:58:26.962,00:58:28.546,I want to know what they are doing to the planet.
00:58:28.588,00:58:30.799,"Aye, Commander."
00:58:35.762,00:58:39.057,"The drill's been sabotaged, sir, but we have reached the planet's core."

00:58:55.573,00:59:00.329,They just launched something at the planet through the hole they just drilled.

00:59:07.252,00:59:14.259,"If my calculations are correct, they're creating a singularity that will consume the planet."
00:59:16.803,00:59:20.349,They're creating a black hole at the center of Vulcan?
00:59:20.391,00:59:22.934,"Yes, sir."
00:59:25.145,00:59:28.399,"Minutes, sir. Minutes."

00:59:38.283,00:59:40.244,My parents will be among them.
00:59:40.285,00:59:42.913,It is impossible.
00:59:42.954,00:59:44.664,I must get them myself.
00:59:44.706,00:59:46.917,"Chekov, you have the conn."
00:59:50.879,00:59:52.839,Kirk to Enterprise!
00:59:52.881,00:59:55.300,Stand by.

01:00:18.490,01:00:19.657,Hold on!
01:00:22.286,01:00:23.870,I got you!
01:00:31.044,01:00:36.300,Kirk to Enterprise!
01:00:36.341,01:00:38.260,I'm trying. I can't lock on to your signal.
01:00:38.302,01:00:40.011,You're moving too fast.
01:00:40.053,01:00:43.014,I can do that.
01:00:43.056,01:00:44.516,Take the conn!

01:00:51.731,01:00:54.276,I can do that! I can do that!
01:00:54.318,01:00:56.320,"Quick, give me manual control!"

01:01:17.341,01:01:19.717,Gotcha!
01:01:28.143,01:01:31.021,Thanks.
01:01:33.273,01:01:36.693,Clear the pad.
01:01:36.734,01:01:38.778,The surface of what?
01:01:38.820,01:01:41.865,"KIRK: What, are you going down there?"
01:01:41.906,01:01:43.408,"Spock, you can't do that!"
01:01:43.450,01:01:44.909,Energize.
01:02:23.699,01:02:25.534,Spock!
01:02:25.576,01:02:27.703,We must evacuate.

01:03:09.536,01:03:11.538,Mother!
01:03:11.580,01:03:13.498,I'm losing her!
01:03:13.540,01:03:15.626,No! I lost her.
01:04:11.931,01:04:15.602,"SPOCK: Acting Captain's Log, Stardate 2258.42."
01:04:17.228,01:04:19.356,We have had no word from Captain Pike.
01:04:21.024,01:04:25.570,I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.
01:04:25.612,01:04:30.158,"Nero, who has destroyed my home planet and most of its six billion inhabitants."
01:04:31.951,01:04:41.628,"While the essence of our culture has been saved in the elders who now reside upon this ship, I estimate no more than 10,000 have survived."
01:04:45.507,01:04:48.468,I am now a member of an endangered species.
01:05:19.875,01:05:21.209,I'm sorry.
01:05:23.086,01:05:24.379,I'm so sorry.
01:05:38.476,01:05:41.438,What do you need?
01:05:41.479,01:05:42.731,Tell me.
01:05:51.448,01:05:56.453,I need everyone to continue performing admirably.
01:06:04.377,01:06:05.545,Okay.
01:06:24.272,01:06:27.400,NERO: You must have a lot of questions for me.
01:06:27.442,01:06:31.195,I only have one for you.
01:06:31.237,01:06:38.202,"I need the subspace frequencies of Starfleet's border protection grids, specifically those surrounding Earth."
01:06:39.913,01:06:43.291,"Christopher, answer my question."
01:06:43.333,01:06:48.254,"No, you answer for the genocide you just committed against a peaceful planet."
01:06:52.008,01:06:57.221,"In my time, where I come from, this is a simple mining vessel."
01:06:57.263,01:07:04.437,I chose a life of honest labor to provide for myself and the wife who was expecting my child.
01:07:04.479,01:07:12.821,"I was off planet, doing my job while your Federation did nothing and allowed my people to burn while their planet broke in half."
01:07:12.863,01:07:15.740,"And Spock, he didn't help us."
01:07:15.782,01:07:17.701,"No, you're confused."
01:07:17.742,01:07:19.452,You've been misinformed.
01:07:19.494,01:07:21.538,It's out there right now.
01:07:21.579,01:07:23.581,You're blaming the Federation for something that hasn't happened.
01:07:23.623,01:07:25.542,It has happened!
01:07:25.583,01:07:28.628,I saw it happen!
01:07:32.799,01:07:38.013,"And when I lost her, I promised myself retribution."
01:07:38.054,01:07:45.979,"And for 25 years I planned my revenge against the Federation, and forgot what it was like to live a normal life."
01:07:46.021,01:07:49.649,But I did not forget the pain.
01:07:49.691,01:07:53.110,It's a pain that every surviving Vulcan now shares.
01:07:54.654,01:08:07.042,"My purpose, Christopher, is to not simply avoid the destruction of the home that I love, but to create a Romulus that exists free of the Federation."
01:08:10.169,01:08:14.173,"You see, only then will she be truly saved."
01:08:14.215,01:08:21.472,"That is why I will destroy all the remaining Federation planets, starting with yours."
01:08:21.514,01:08:23.975,Then we have nothing left to discuss.
01:08:28.104,01:08:30.732,You will give me the frequencies to disable Earth's defenses.
01:08:34.193,01:08:36.863,Centaurian slugs.
01:08:36.905,01:08:44.454,They latch on to your brain stem and release a toxin that will force you to answer.
01:08:44.495,01:08:47.164,"Frequencies, please, sir."
01:08:47.206,01:08:49.459,"Christopher Pike, Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise..."
01:08:49.500,01:08:50.835,As you wish.
01:08:58.551,01:09:00.470,SPOCK: Have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth?
01:09:00.511,01:09:03.556,"Their trajectory suggests no other destination, Captain."
01:09:03.598,01:09:06.517,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
01:09:03.598,01:09:08.979,"Earth may be his next stop, but we have to assume every Federation planet's a target."
01:09:09.020,01:09:10.897,Out of the chair.
01:09:10.939,01:09:15.276,"Well, if the Federation is a target, why didn't they destroy us?"
01:09:15.318,01:09:17.988,Why would they?
01:09:18.029,01:09:19.614,That is not it.
01:09:19.656,01:09:22.826,"He said he wanted me to see something, the destruction of my home planet."
01:09:22.867,01:09:24.869,"How the hell did they do that, by the way?"
01:09:24.911,01:09:26.955,"I mean, where did the Romulans get that kind of weaponry?"
01:09:26.997,01:09:32.543,The engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create a black hole may suggest an answer.
01:09:32.585,01:09:36.965,Such technology could theoretically be manipulated to create a tunnel through space-time.
01:09:37.007,01:09:38.967,"Damn it, man, I'm a doctor, not a physicist."
01:09:39.009,01:09:41.136,Are you actually suggesting they're from the future?
01:09:41.177,01:09:46.016,"If you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
01:09:46.057,01:09:49.853,Then what would an angry future Romulan want with Captain Pike?
01:09:49.894,01:09:52.355,"As Captain, he does know details of Starfleet's defenses."
01:09:52.396,01:09:56.484,"What we need to do is catch up to that ship, disable it, take it over and get Pike back."
01:09:56.526,01:09:58.402,We are technologically outmatched in every way.
01:09:58.444,01:10:00.697,A rescue attempt would be illogical.
01:10:00.738,01:10:03.533,Nero's ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them.
01:10:03.574,01:10:07.120,Then what about assigning engineering crews to try and boost our warp yield?
01:10:07.162,01:10:10.874,SPOCK: Remaining crew are repairing radiation leaks on the lower decks...
01:10:10.915,01:10:14.251,"...and damage to subspace communications, without which we cannot contact Starfleet."
01:10:14.293,01:10:18.173,We must gather with the rest of Starfleet to balance the terms of the next engagement.
01:10:18.214,01:10:19.799,There won't be a next engagement.
01:10:19.841,01:10:22.802,"By the time we've gathered, it'll be too late."
01:10:22.844,01:10:25.180,"But you say he's from the future, knows what's gonna happen?"
01:10:25.221,01:10:27.473,Then the logical thing is to be unpredictable.
01:10:27.515,01:10:31.310,You're assuming that Nero knows how events are predicted to unfold.
01:10:31.352,01:10:42.363,"The contrary, Nero's very presence has altered the flow of history, beginning with the attack on the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the events of today, thereby creating an entire new chain of incidents that cannot be anticipated by either party."
01:10:42.405,01:10:44.532,An alternate reality.
01:10:44.574,01:10:46.492,Precisely.
01:10:46.534,01:10:53.290,"Whatever our lives might have been, if the time continuum was disrupted, our destinies have changed."
01:10:53.332,01:10:55.919,"Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the Laurentian system, warp factor 3."
01:10:55.960,01:10:58.129,"KIRK: Spock, don't do that."
01:10:58.171,01:11:01.298,Running back to the rest of the fleet for a confab is a massive waste of time.
01:11:01.340,01:11:03.384,These are the orders issued by Captain Pike when he left the ship.
01:11:03.426,01:11:05.261,He also ordered us to go back and get him.
01:11:05.302,01:11:06.888,"Spock, you are Captain now."
01:11:06.930,01:11:08.932,"I am aware of my responsibilities, Mr. Kirk."
01:11:08.973,01:11:10.892,"Every second we waste, Nero's getting closer to his next target."
01:11:10.934,01:11:15.605,"That is correct, and why I'm instructing you to accept the fact that I alone am in command."
01:11:15.646,01:11:17.565,"Jim, he's the Captain!"
01:11:15.646,01:11:20.902,"...away from the problem, instead of hunting Nero down!"
01:11:27.324,01:11:30.494,Hey!
01:11:36.417,01:11:38.253,Get him off this ship.
01:11:58.564,01:12:01.442,"Computer, where am I?"
01:12:01.484,01:12:03.694,Class-M planet. Unsafe.
01:12:03.736,01:12:06.405,There is a Starfleet outpost 14 kilometers to the northwest.
01:12:06.447,01:12:11.035,Remain in your pod until retrieved by Starfleet authorities.
01:12:53.536,01:12:57.498,Stardate 2258.42.
01:12:57.540,01:13:01.544,Or 44. Whatever.
01:13:01.585,01:13:12.347,"Acting Captain Spock has marooned me on Delta Vega, in what I believe to be a violation of Security Protocol 49.09 governing the treatment of prisoners aboard a star..."
01:15:23.353,01:15:24.645,James T. Kirk.
01:15:27.148,01:15:29.525,Excuse me?
01:15:31.610,01:15:34.405,How do you know my name?
01:15:34.447,01:15:39.327,I have been and always shall be your friend.
01:15:42.497,01:15:46.417,"Look, I don't know you."
01:15:51.547,01:15:53.383,Bullshit.
01:15:53.424,01:15:56.593,"It is remarkably pleasing to see you again, old friend."
01:15:56.635,01:15:59.305,Especially after the events of today.
01:16:01.057,01:16:07.146,"Sir, I appreciate what you did for me today, but if you were Spock, you'd know we're not friends."
01:16:07.188,01:16:09.648,You hate me.
01:16:09.690,01:16:11.650,Mutiny?
01:16:11.692,01:16:13.444,You are not the captain?
01:16:16.655,01:16:22.119,"No, no, you're the captain."
01:16:23.538,01:16:24.705,By Nero.
01:16:30.711,01:16:33.214,What do you know about him?
01:16:33.256,01:16:35.799,He is a particularly troubled Romulan.
01:16:37.260,01:16:41.180,"Please, allow me."
01:16:41.222,01:16:42.639,What are you doing?
01:16:42.681,01:16:45.393,"Our minds, one and together."
01:16:48.187,01:16:54.110,"One hundred twenty-nine years from now, a star will explode and threaten to destroy the galaxy."
01:16:55.819,01:16:59.532,"I'm from, Jim, the future."
01:17:03.994,01:17:10.751,"A star went supernova, consuming everything in its path."
01:17:10.793,01:17:14.297,I promised the Romulans that I would save their planet.
01:17:19.510,01:17:21.554,We outfitted our fastest ship.
01:17:23.306,01:17:27.602,"Using red matter, I would create a black hole which would absorb the exploding star."
01:17:29.686,01:17:32.398,"I was en route, when the unthinkable happened."
01:17:33.816,01:17:36.819,The supernova destroyed Romulus.
01:17:42.658,01:17:44.410,I had little time.
01:17:47.079,01:17:50.874,I had to extract the red matter and shoot it into the supernova.
01:18:07.766,01:18:10.727,"As I began my return trip, I was intercepted."
01:18:10.769,01:18:15.024,"He called himself Nero, last of the Romulan Empire."
01:18:15.065,01:18:19.153,"In my attempt to escape, both of us were pulled into the black hole."
01:18:27.119,01:18:30.665,Nero went through first.
01:18:36.795,01:18:41.384,spent the next 25 years awaiting my arrival.
01:18:41.425,01:18:46.681,But what was years for Nero was only seconds for me.
01:18:47.931,01:18:50.059,I went through the black hole.
01:18:52.353,01:18:54.730,Nero was waiting for me.
01:19:00.570,01:19:03.531,He held me responsible for the loss of his world.
01:19:05.658,01:19:11.664,"He captured my vessel and spared my life, for one reason."
01:19:11.706,01:19:14.041,So that I would know his pain.
01:19:16.126,01:19:19.922,He beamed me here so that I could observe his vengeance.
01:19:21.549,01:19:27.597,"As he was helpless to save his planet, I would be helpless to save mine."
01:19:30.849,01:19:35.563,"Billions of lives lost because of me, Jim."
01:19:35.605,01:19:38.065,Because I failed.
01:19:40.234,01:19:44.154,Forgive me.
01:19:51.954,01:19:55.207,So you do feel.
01:19:55.249,01:19:58.711,"Going back in time, you changed all our lives."
01:19:58.753,01:20:02.214,"Jim, we must go."
01:20:02.256,01:20:06.385,There is a Starfleet outpost not far from here.
01:20:06.427,01:20:10.222,Wait.
01:20:06.427,01:20:14.477,"Where you came from, did I know my father?"
01:20:15.852,01:20:18.021,Yes.
01:20:18.063,01:20:21.900,You often spoke of him as being your inspiration for joining Starfleet.
01:20:21.942,01:20:26.029,He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise.
01:20:26.071,01:20:27.573,Captain?
01:20:27.615,01:20:30.743,A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.
01:20:39.126,01:20:41.420,"Warp 3, sir."
01:20:41.462,01:20:44.340,"CHEKOV: Laurentian system, sir."
01:20:44.381,01:20:47.384,McCOY: You wanted to see me?
01:20:49.136,01:20:51.347,I am aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours.
01:20:51.388,01:20:54.391,I recognize that supporting me as you did must have been difficult.
01:20:54.433,01:20:56.226,Is that a thank-you?
01:20:56.268,01:20:58.937,I am simply acknowledging your difficulties.
01:20:58.979,01:21:00.731,"Permission to speak freely, sir."
01:21:02.399,01:21:06.069,I welcome it.
01:21:06.111,01:21:08.447,Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
01:21:08.489,01:21:11.158,"Are you making a logical choice, sending Kirk away?"
01:21:11.200,01:21:12.827,Probably.
01:21:12.868,01:21:18.290,"You know, back home we got a saying, If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, you don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."
01:21:18.332,01:21:24.296,"A curious metaphor, Doctor, as a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential."
01:21:24.338,01:21:26.549,"My God, man, you could at least act like it was a hard decision!"
01:21:26.590,01:21:30.678,I intend to assist in the effort to reestablish communication with Starfleet.
01:21:30.720,01:21:37.518,"However, if crew morale is better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I will gladly defer to your medical expertise."
01:21:38.894,01:21:40.229,Excuse me.
01:21:44.567,01:21:46.068,Green-blooded hobgoblin.
01:22:23.689,01:22:24.981,Hello!
01:23:07.441,01:23:08.651,What?
01:23:12.863,01:23:14.740,You realize how unacceptable this is?
01:23:14.782,01:23:16.492,Fascinating.
01:23:16.533,01:23:19.662,"Okay, I'm sure you're just doing your job, but could you not have come a wee bit sooner?"
01:23:19.703,01:23:24.458,"Six months I've been here, living off Starfleet protein nibs and the promise of a good meal!"
01:23:24.500,01:23:27.085,"And I know exactly what's going on here, okay?"
01:23:27.127,01:23:29.045,"Punishment, isn't it?"
01:23:29.087,01:23:31.006,For something that was clearly an accident.
01:23:31.047,01:23:33.717,You are Montgomery Scott.
01:23:33.759,01:23:36.094,"Aye, that's me."
01:23:36.136,01:23:39.389,"Unless there's another hardworking, equally starved Starfleet officer around."
01:23:39.431,01:23:42.058,Me.
01:23:42.100,01:23:44.645,You don't eat anything!
01:23:42.100,01:23:48.106,"You can eat, like, a bean, and you're done."
01:23:48.148,01:23:50.484,"But you're here now, so thank you."
01:23:50.526,01:23:54.864,"You are, in fact, the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of transwarp beaming."
01:23:54.905,01:23:58.325,That's what I'm talking about.
01:23:58.367,01:24:04.122,I had a little debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics and how it pertains to subspace travel.
01:24:04.164,01:24:09.628,He seemed to think that the range of transporting something like a grapefruit was limited to about 100 miles.
01:24:09.670,01:24:18.136,"I told him that I could not only beam a grapefruit from one planet to the adjacent planet in the same system, which is easy, by the way, I could do it with a life-form."
01:24:18.178,01:24:21.139,"So, I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle."
01:24:21.181,01:24:22.892,I know that dog.
01:24:22.933,01:24:24.977,I'll tell you when it reappears.
01:24:25.019,01:24:27.229,I don't know. I do feel guilty about that.
01:24:27.270,01:24:33.151,"SPOCK PRIME: What if I told you that your transwarp theory was correct, that it is indeed possible to beam onto a ship that is traveling at warp speed?"
01:24:33.193,01:24:35.654,"I think if that equation had been discovered, I'd have heard about it."
01:24:35.696,01:24:40.617,"The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr. Scott, is because you haven't discovered it yet."
01:24:45.455,01:24:49.334,Are you from the future?
01:24:49.376,01:24:52.128,"Well, that's brilliant."
01:24:52.170,01:24:54.381,"SCOTTY: Well, she's a wee bit dodgy."
01:24:54.423,01:24:57.927,"Shield emitters are totally banjaxed, as well as a few other things."
01:24:57.968,01:24:59.469,On youse go.
01:24:59.511,01:25:02.431,"So the Enterprise has had its maiden voyage, has it?"
01:25:02.472,01:25:04.140,She is one well-endowed lady.
01:25:04.182,01:25:09.980,"I'd like to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance."
01:25:10.022,01:25:21.825,"Except, the thing is, even if I believed you, right, where you're from, what I've done, which I don't, by the way, you're still talking about beaming aboard the Enterprise while she's traveling faster than light without a proper receiving pad."
01:25:21.867,01:25:24.703,Get off there!
01:25:24.745,01:25:31.961,"The notion of transwarp beaming is like trying to hit a bullet with a smaller bullet whilst wearing a blindfold, riding a horse."
01:25:32.002,01:25:33.462,What's that?
01:25:33.503,01:25:37.299,Your equation for achieving transwarp beaming.
01:25:38.968,01:25:40.928,Get out of it.
01:25:44.306,01:25:46.516,Imagine that!
01:25:46.558,01:25:48.894,It never occurred to me to think of space as the thing that was moving.
01:25:48.936,01:25:51.229,"You're coming with us, right?"
01:25:52.815,01:25:55.818,"No, Jim."
01:25:57.402,01:25:59.571,He... The other Spock is not gonna believe me.
01:25:59.613,01:26:01.490,Only you can explain what the hell's happened.
01:26:01.531,01:26:03.784,Under no circumstances can he be made aware of my existence.
01:26:03.826,01:26:06.244,You must promise me this.
01:26:06.286,01:26:08.288,You're telling me I can't tell you that I'm following your own orders?
01:26:08.330,01:26:11.875,Why not? What happens?
01:26:11.917,01:26:15.420,"To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship."
01:26:15.462,01:26:18.590,How?
01:26:18.632,01:26:21.718,"However, there is Starfleet Regulation 619."
01:26:21.760,01:26:30.226,Six-one-nine states that any command officer who's emotionally compromised by the mission at hand must resign said command.
01:26:32.562,01:26:36.525,"So, you're saying that I have to emotionally compromise you guys."
01:26:36.566,01:26:40.779,"Jim, I just lost my planet."
01:26:40.821,01:26:44.616,"I can tell you, I am emotionally compromised."
01:26:44.658,01:26:47.452,What you must do is get me to show it.
01:26:47.494,01:26:51.081,"SCOTTY: Aye, then, laddie."
01:26:55.460,01:26:58.380,"No, go. You cannae come with me. Go on."
01:27:00.423,01:27:05.137,"You know, coming back in time, changing history, that's cheating."
01:27:07.472,01:27:09.516,A trick I learned from an old friend.
01:27:18.441,01:27:21.195,Live long and prosper.
01:27:41.256,01:27:42.966,Mr. Scott!
01:27:47.763,01:27:50.432,can you hear me?
01:27:56.271,01:27:57.564,Uh...
01:27:57.606,01:28:00.025,Hold on a second!
01:28:00.067,01:28:01.276,"Oh, no."
01:28:04.863,01:28:06.322,"Don't worry, I..."
01:28:17.167,01:28:18.376,No. No!
01:28:38.230,01:28:40.565,COMPUTER: Turbine release valve activated.
01:28:47.489,01:28:49.866,You all right?
01:28:51.952,01:28:54.496,"My head's buzzing and I'm soaked, but otherwise I'm fine."
01:28:54.537,01:29:00.543,Captain Spock! Detecting unauthorized access to Water Turbine Control Board.
01:29:00.585,01:29:02.671,Bring up the video.
01:29:06.091,01:29:07.717,"Security, seal the Engineering Deck."
01:29:07.759,01:29:10.595,We have intruders in Turbine Section 3.
01:29:10.637,01:29:11.847,Set phasers to stun.
01:29:23.942,01:29:25.277,MAN: Halt!
01:29:29.156,01:29:32.201,"Come with me, cupcake!"
01:29:39.958,01:29:41.501,Who are you?
01:29:41.543,01:29:44.046,He's with me.
01:29:44.087,01:29:45.630,How did you manage to beam aboard this ship?
01:29:45.672,01:29:47.716,"Well, you're the genius, you figure it out."
01:29:47.757,01:29:50.302,"As acting captain of this vessel, I order you to answer the question."
01:29:50.344,01:29:53.222,"Well, I'm not telling, Acting Captain."
01:29:53.263,01:29:55.349,"What, did..."
01:29:55.389,01:29:58.101,"That doesn't frustrate you, does it?"
01:29:58.143,01:29:59.435,That doesn't make you angry.
01:29:59.477,01:30:00.854,Are you a member of Starfleet?
01:30:00.896,01:30:03.273,"I... Yes. Can I get a towel, please?"
01:30:03.315,01:30:07.903,"Under penalty of court martial, I order you to explain to me how you were able to beam aboard this ship while moving at warp."
01:30:07.944,01:30:09.571,Well...
01:30:09.612,01:30:11.114,You will answer me.
01:30:12.949,01:30:16.494,I'd rather not take sides.
01:30:18.454,01:30:24.002,"Your planet was just destroyed, your mother murdered, and you're not even upset."
01:30:20.790,01:30:28.882,"If you are presuming that these experiences in any way impede my ability to command this ship, you are mistaken."
01:30:27.130,01:30:31.760,"And yet, you are the one who said fear was necessary for command."
01:30:31.801,01:30:35.680,"I mean, did you see his ship?"
01:30:35.722,01:30:37.891,"Yes, of course I did."
01:30:37.933,01:30:40.310,I will not allow you to lecture me about the merits of emotion.
01:30:40.352,01:30:42.396,Then why don't you stop me?
01:30:42.436,01:30:45.690,What is it like not to feel anger?
01:30:45.732,01:30:49.778,Or the need to stop at nothing to avenge the death of the woman who gave birth to you?
01:30:49.819,01:30:51.780,Back away from me.
01:30:51.821,01:30:54.699,It must not even compute for you.
01:30:54.741,01:30:55.909,You never loved her!
01:31:20.976,01:31:22.227,Spock!
01:31:59.513,01:32:02.225,"Doctor, I am no longer fit for duty."
01:32:02.267,01:32:08.440,"I hereby relinquish my command, based on the fact that I have been emotionally compromised."
01:32:08.482,01:32:11.525,Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
01:32:37.469,01:32:41.014,I like this ship!
01:32:43.475,01:32:45.727,"Well, congratulations, Jim."
01:32:45.768,01:32:50.564,"Now we've got no captain, and no goddamn first officer to replace him."
01:32:50.606,01:32:52.526,"Yeah, we do."
01:32:52.566,01:32:55.111,What?
01:32:55.153,01:32:58.448,You gotta be kidding me.
01:33:01.117,01:33:04.413,"I sure hope you know what you're doing, Captain."
01:33:06.456,01:33:07.665,So do I.
01:33:12.504,01:33:16.508,"Attention, crew of the Enterprise."
01:33:16.550,01:33:21.054,commission and advanced me to acting captain.
01:33:21.096,01:33:26.935,"I know you were all expecting to regroup with the fleet, but I'm ordering a pursuit course of the enemy ship to Earth."
01:33:26.976,01:33:30.522,I want all departments at battle stations and ready in 10 minutes.
01:33:30.564,01:33:34.401,Either we're going down or they are.
01:33:35.944,01:33:37.195,Kirk out.
01:33:44.578,01:33:46.371,"Speak your mind, Spock."
01:33:49.583,01:33:51.751,That would be unwise.
01:33:51.793,01:33:56.423,What is necessary is never unwise.
01:33:56.465,01:33:59.675,I am as conflicted as I once was as a child.
01:34:01.719,01:34:04.431,You will always be a child of two worlds.
01:34:06.475,01:34:08.310,I am grateful for this.
01:34:10.145,01:34:11.313,And for you.
01:34:13.315,01:34:16.568,I feel anger for the one who took Mother's life.
01:34:18.111,01:34:20.280,An anger I cannot control.
01:34:24.409,01:34:33.960,"I believe that she would say, Do not try to."
01:34:34.002,01:34:38.798,You asked me once why I married your mother.
01:34:42.885,01:34:45.054,I married her because I loved her.
01:34:53.355,01:34:56.107,"KIRK: Whatever the case, we need to get aboard Nero's ship undetected."
01:34:56.149,01:34:58.485,"McCOY: We can't just go in there guns blazing, Jim, not with their technology."
01:34:58.527,01:35:00.862,"SULU: I'm telling you, the math doesn't support what you're suggesting."
01:35:00.903,01:35:03.156,Captain Kirk. Captain Kirk!
01:35:03.198,01:35:08.578,"Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan, I have projected that Nero will travel past Saturn."
01:35:08.620,01:35:12.040,"Like you said, we need to stay invisible to Nero or he'll destroy us."
01:35:12.081,01:35:24.302,"If Mr. Scott can get us to warp factor 4, and if we drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors."
01:35:24.344,01:35:30.475,"From there, as long as the drill is not actuated, we can beam aboard the enemy ship."
01:35:30.517,01:35:32.310,"Wait a minute, kid."
01:35:32.352,01:35:35.063,"Seventeen, sir."
01:35:35.104,01:35:36.730,SPOCK: Doctor.
01:35:36.772,01:35:40.402,Mr. Chekov is correct.
01:35:40.443,01:35:48.410,"If Mr. Sulu is able to maneuver us into position, I can beam aboard Nero's ship, steal back the black hole device and, if possible, bring back Captain Pike."
01:35:48.451,01:35:51.120,"I won't allow you to do that, Mr. Spock."
01:35:51.162,01:35:54.290,Romulans and Vulcans share a common ancestry.
01:35:54.332,01:35:59.212,Our cultural similarities will make it easier for me to access the ship's computer to locate the device.
01:36:00.963,01:36:06.010,"Also, my mother was human, which makes Earth the only home I have left."
01:36:12.350,01:36:14.561,Then I'm coming with you.
01:36:14.603,01:36:18.481,"I would cite Regulation, but I know you will simply ignore it."
01:36:20.358,01:36:23.027,See? We are getting to know each other.
01:36:38.960,01:36:40.169,Prepare the drill.
01:36:56.436,01:37:01.983,"All stop in three, two, one."
01:37:07.363,01:37:10.158,Give me one-quarter impulse burst for five seconds.
01:37:10.199,01:37:12.118,I'll do the rest with thrusters.
01:37:12.160,01:37:14.370,Aye.
01:37:41.523,01:37:44.484,Transporter Room.
01:37:44.526,01:37:48.029,"Really? Fine job, Mr. Sulu. Well done."
01:37:48.070,01:37:52.534,"How are we, Scotty?"
01:37:55.036,01:38:02.544,"Whatever happens, Mr. Sulu, if you think you have the tactical advantage, you fire on that ship, even if we're still onboard."
01:38:04.212,01:38:06.005,"Yes, sir."
01:38:06.047,01:38:09.467,KIRK ON COMLINK: Otherwise we'll contact the Enterprise when we're ready to be beamed back.
01:38:09.509,01:38:10.677,Good luck.
01:38:23.690,01:38:26.526,I will be back.
01:38:28.570,01:38:31.489,I'll be monitoring your frequency.
01:38:48.339,01:38:51.133,So her first name's Nyota?
01:38:51.175,01:38:56.598,"Okey-dokey, then, if there's any common sense in the design of the enemy ship, I should be putting you somewhere in the Cargo Bay."
01:38:56.639,01:38:59.225,Shouldn't be a soul in sight.
01:39:42.477,01:39:45.396,"Captain, we have Starfleet officers aboard the ship."
01:39:45.438,01:39:47.482,One of them is Vulcan.
01:39:52.278,01:39:53.446,Ayel!
01:40:08.085,01:40:09.629,I'll cover you.
01:40:09.671,01:40:11.506,Are you certain?
01:40:31.609,01:40:34.654,Do you know where it is?
01:40:36.614,01:40:38.324,And Captain Pike.
01:41:01.138,01:41:02.765,Move!
01:41:02.807,01:41:06.101,They have activated the drill.
01:41:06.143,01:41:07.729,Communication and transport are inoperative.
01:41:07.770,01:41:09.438,"Sulu, please tell me you have them."
01:41:09.480,01:41:11.106,Otherwise we won't be able to beam them back.
01:41:11.148,01:41:12.567,Kirk and Spock are on their own now.
01:41:31.627,01:41:33.671,I foresee a complication.
01:41:33.713,01:41:36.089,The design of their ship is far more advanced than I had anticipated.
01:41:36.131,01:41:39.218,COMPUTER: Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled.
01:41:39.260,01:41:40.970,"Welcome back, Ambassador Spock."
01:41:41.012,01:41:44.015,"Wow, that's weird."
01:41:44.057,01:41:46.935,"Computer, what is your manufacturing origin?"
01:41:46.976,01:41:51.480,COMPUTER: Stardate 2387.
01:41:54.483,01:41:57.028,It appears that you have been keeping important information from me.
01:41:57.070,01:41:58.947,"You're gonna be able to fly this thing, right?"
01:41:58.988,01:42:02.115,Something tells me I already have.
01:42:02.157,01:42:04.786,Good luck.
01:42:04.827,01:42:08.330,The statistical likelihood that our plan will succeed is less than 4.3%.
01:42:08.372,01:42:10.499,It'll work.
01:42:08.372,01:42:12.376,"In the event that I do not return, please tell Lieutenant Uhura..."
01:42:12.418,01:42:14.253,It'll work.
01:42:24.055,01:42:25.347,Fascinating.
01:42:34.189,01:42:36.149,COMPUTER: Start-up sequence initiated.
01:43:20.653,01:43:22.530,"Nero, order your men to disable the drill or I will..."
01:43:33.290,01:43:36.209,I know your face from Earth's history.
01:44:21.463,01:44:24.926,James T. Kirk was considered to be a great man.
01:44:24.967,01:44:27.511,He went on to captain the U.S.S. Enterprise.
01:44:27.553,01:44:29.513,But that was another life.
01:44:29.555,01:44:32.683,"A life I will deprive you of, just like I did your father."
01:45:05.466,01:45:07.843,ROMULAN COMMANDER ON PA: Captain Nero. The Vulcan ship has been taken.
01:45:07.885,01:45:09.804,The drill has been destroyed.
01:45:09.845,01:45:11.222,Spock!
01:45:12.765,01:45:14.391,Spock!
01:45:31.993,01:45:35.204,Open a channel.
01:45:35.246,01:45:38.457,Spock. I knew I should have killed you when I had the chance.
01:45:38.499,01:45:42.170,I hereby confiscate this illegally obtained ship and order you to surrender your vessel.
01:45:42.211,01:45:43.963,No terms. No deals.
01:45:44.005,01:45:47.716,"Sir, if you ignite the red matter, you'll destroy..."
01:46:02.731,01:46:04.817,"ROMULAN OFFICER: He went to warp, sir."
01:46:04.859,01:46:06.110,"Yes, sir!"
01:46:35.848,01:46:38.851,Your species is even weaker than I expected.
01:46:40.393,01:46:42.395,You can't what?
01:46:42.437,01:46:44.606,You can't even speak.
01:46:46.608,01:46:49.486,What?
01:47:15.846,01:47:17.639,What's he doing?
01:47:17.681,01:47:21.476,"COMPUTER: Ambassador Spock, you are on a collision course."
01:47:21.518,01:47:22.770,Fire everything!
01:47:29.735,01:47:34.115,COMPUTER: Incoming missiles.
01:47:34.156,01:47:35.574,Understood.
01:47:41.789,01:47:43.374,"Captain, I've picked up another ship!"
01:48:05.271,01:48:08.399,What are you doing here?
01:48:28.127,01:48:29.378,"KIRK: Enterprise, now!"
01:48:52.276,01:48:54.653,"Nice timing, Scotty!"
01:48:54.695,01:48:59.532,three people from two targets onto one pad before!
01:48:59.574,01:49:01.534,Jim!
01:49:01.576,01:49:03.078,I got him.
01:49:05.164,01:49:06.457,That was pretty good!
01:49:08.625,01:49:10.919,"Captain, the enemy ship is losing power!"
01:49:10.961,01:49:12.421,Hail them now.
01:49:47.706,01:49:50.501,This is Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
01:49:50.543,01:49:52.336,Your ship is compromised.
01:49:52.378,01:49:56.589,"Too close to the singularity to survive without assistance, which we are willing to provide."
01:49:59.801,01:50:02.679,"Captain, what are you doing?"
01:49:59.801,01:50:04.432,Showing them compassion may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus.
01:50:04.473,01:50:07.560,"It's logic, Spock."
01:50:07.600,01:50:10.312,"No, not really."
01:50:10.354,01:50:14.775,I would rather suffer the end of Romulus a thousand times.
01:50:14.816,01:50:18.946,I would rather die in agony than accept assistance from you.
01:50:18.987,01:50:21.073,You got it.
01:50:21.115,01:50:23.867,Arm phasers.
01:51:08.329,01:51:10.414,"Sulu, let's go home."
01:51:10.456,01:51:11.706,"Yes, sir!"
01:51:22.801,01:51:24.886,Why aren't we at warp?
01:51:24.928,01:51:27.264,Kirk to Engineering.
01:51:27.306,01:51:28.681,"You bet your ass, Captain!"
01:51:32.269,01:51:34.438,"Captain, we're caught in the gravity well!"
01:51:34.480,01:51:37.774,Go to maximum warp! Push it!
01:51:47.117,01:51:49.077,All she's got isn't good enough!
01:51:49.119,01:51:52.247,What else you got?
01:51:49.119,01:51:53.706,"Okay, if we eject the core and detonate, the blast could be enough to push us away."
01:51:53.748,01:51:55.501,"I cannae promise anything, though!"
01:51:58.504,01:52:01.131,"Do it, do it, do it!"
01:52:01.173,01:52:02.883,Clear the area! Go!
01:53:30.178,01:53:31.597,Father!
01:53:40.105,01:53:41.732,I am not our father.
01:53:49.364,01:53:54.119,There are so few Vulcans left.
01:53:57.372,01:54:00.875,Then why did you send Kirk aboard when you alone could have explained the truth?
01:54:00.917,01:54:04.129,Because you needed each other.
01:54:00.917,01:54:12.012,"I could not deprive you of the revelation of all that you could accomplish together, of a friendship that will define you both in ways you cannot yet realize."
01:54:13.972,01:54:16.266,How did you persuade him to keep your secret?
01:54:16.308,01:54:22.189,He inferred that universe-ending paradoxes would ensue should he break his promise.
01:54:23.398,01:54:26.193,I... I implied.
01:54:26.234,01:54:29.321,A gamble.
01:54:29.363,01:54:32.282,One I hope that you'll repeat in the future in Starfleet.
01:54:32.324,01:54:37.078,"In the face of extinction, it is only logical I resign my Starfleet commission and help rebuild our race."
01:54:37.120,01:54:40.582,"And yet, you can be in two places at once."
01:54:40.624,01:54:43.794,I urge you to remain in Starfleet.
01:54:43.836,01:54:48.298,I have already located a suitable planet on which to establish a Vulcan colony.
01:54:48.340,01:54:53.345,"Spock, in this case, do yourself a favor."
01:54:53.387,01:54:56.765,Put aside logic.
01:55:02.646,01:55:10.278,"Since my customary farewell would appear oddly self-serving, I shall simply say good luck."
01:55:21.206,01:55:25.335,ASSEMBLY PRESIDENT: This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk.
01:55:25.377,01:55:37.472,"Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades is in keeping with the highest traditions of service, and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew and the Federation."
01:55:37.514,01:55:40.392,It is my honor to award you with this commendation.
01:55:45.313,01:55:53.196,"By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report to Admiral Pike, U.S.S. Enterprise, for duty as his relief."
01:56:02.247,01:56:04.207,"I relieve you, sir."
01:56:04.249,01:56:05.959,I am relieved.
01:56:07.961,01:56:10.338,"Thank you, sir."
01:56:12.591,01:56:14.468,Your father would be proud.
01:56:43.747,01:56:45.999,Thrusters on full.
01:56:46.040,01:56:48.919,"Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at your command, sir."
01:56:48.961,01:56:51.546,Weapons systems and shields on standby.
01:56:51.588,01:56:54.299,"Dock Control reports ready, Captain."
01:56:58.762,01:57:01.556,Bones! Buckle up.
01:57:06.060,01:57:07.729,"Scotty, how we doing?"
01:57:07.771,01:57:11.316,"Dilithium chamber's at maximum, Captain."
01:57:11.358,01:57:12.901,Get down!
01:57:14.987,01:57:17.823,"Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrusters."
01:57:20.909,01:57:23.495,"Permission to come aboard, Captain."
01:57:23.537,01:57:26.122,Permission granted.
01:57:26.164,01:57:31.879,"As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully I would like to submit my candidacy."
01:57:31.920,01:57:35.716,"Should you desire, I can provide character references."
01:57:35.757,01:57:38.051,"It would be my honor, Commander."
01:57:41.722,01:57:44.182,"Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu."
01:57:45.934,01:57:47.853,SULU: Thrusters on standby.
01:57:47.895,01:57:50.230,Take us out.

01:58:00.323,01:58:04.745,These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
