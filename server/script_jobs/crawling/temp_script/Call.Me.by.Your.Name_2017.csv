00:03:34.422,00:03:35.590,I'll go down.
00:03:52.982,00:03:55.443,"Darling, come help Oliver take his things up to his room."
00:03:55.526,00:03:56.945,-He's already here? -Yes!
00:04:26.557,00:04:27.892,You're leaving?
00:04:31.896,00:04:32.981,Nice to meet you.

00:09:00.873,00:09:02.333,Thank you.
00:09:06.379,00:09:09.465,"Peaches, cherries, apricots..."
00:11:48.874,00:11:50.251,"Help yourself, darling."
00:11:50.334,00:11:51.627,Thanks.
00:13:42.154,00:13:44.156,"-Ciao, Romano. -Ciao, Oliver."
00:13:44.240,00:13:46.825,-How are you? -All good.
00:13:52.081,00:13:53.624,"Ciao, boys!"
00:13:53.707,00:13:55.543,All good?
00:13:55.626,00:13:57.294,All good!
00:13:58.963,00:14:01.799,-Can you start please? -Of course!
00:14:22.486,00:14:23.737,"Good morning, gentlemen."
00:14:34.331,00:14:35.916,"Go, Chiara!"
00:14:44.800,00:14:47.261,He's better than the guy who came last year.
00:14:47.344,00:14:48.554,Remember?
00:14:49.221,00:14:50.639,Get in there!
00:14:50.723,00:14:53.601,Much better! See how cute he is.
00:15:05.321,00:15:06.822,"Elio, water!"
00:15:59.792,00:16:03.420,"Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and the others are coming over for dinner."
00:16:04.213,00:16:06.924,Is Oliver staying with us or going out?
00:16:07.007,00:16:08.342,Don't know.
00:16:09.259,00:16:10.719,What a movie star!
00:16:10.970,00:16:13.514,"Yes, those Americans..."
00:16:36.829,00:16:38.747,Sparkling wine!
00:16:39.707,00:16:41.083,He's late.
00:16:42.459,00:16:43.752,Don't you think...
00:16:44.712,00:16:47.756,"Don't you think he's impolite when he says, Later?"
00:16:48.924,00:16:50.551,Arrogant.
00:17:10.279,00:17:11.405,"Oh, no, sweetheart."
00:17:13.907,00:17:16.493,"-Take his plates away. -Very well, madam."
00:17:43.771,00:17:45.481,I don't want to.
00:17:46.315,00:17:47.316,Why not?
00:17:47.608,00:17:49.068,Because I don't want to.
00:17:49.151,00:17:51.653,Why don't you go to Moscazzano with others?
00:17:51.737,00:17:53.280,Because I don't want to.
00:18:03.999,00:18:05.626,"Play well, darling."
00:25:19.851,00:25:21.811,Have you been to the river?
00:25:36.159,00:25:37.494,Mafalda!
00:25:38.078,00:25:39.412,Isn't she beautiful?
00:27:34.402,00:27:35.570,Come here.
00:27:37.906,00:27:39.324,What's going on?
00:27:39.407,00:27:41.201,Is he trying to get it on with her?
00:27:41.326,00:27:43.453,"Elio, he already succeeded?"
00:27:45.372,00:27:46.790,What do I know?
00:27:46.873,00:27:48.541,I'd love to be in his shoes.
00:27:48.625,00:27:50.543,Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?
00:27:53.004,00:27:55.256,"She wants him, no matter what!"
00:28:39.509,00:28:40.677,Coming?
00:28:43.012,00:28:44.347,I'll come later.
00:29:59.756,00:30:02.634,Are you with me because you're mad at Chiara?
00:30:02.717,00:30:04.385,Why would I be mad at Chiara?
00:30:05.595,00:30:07.096,Because of him.
00:30:07.180,00:30:08.640,Because of who?
00:30:09.808,00:30:11.059,Of Oliver.
00:30:22.570,00:30:23.947,Turn around.
00:30:38.586,00:30:40.421,Meet me here tomorrow night?
00:30:47.303,00:30:49.597,Wait for me!
00:30:49.681,00:30:51.224,Come on.
00:32:02.754,00:32:04.213,What are you doing?
00:32:04.339,00:32:06.257,Going to Lake Garda with my dad.
00:32:06.341,00:32:08.343,He wants to show Oliver where he's dredging.
00:32:09.302,00:32:10.678,Can you tell him I came by?
00:32:11.638,00:32:13.514,"He's inside with my dad, helping him."
00:32:15.350,00:32:18.770,"You were amazing last night, on the dance floor."
00:32:18.853,00:32:20.730,-He's a good dancer. -A good dancer.
00:32:23.107,00:32:24.776,He's good-looking too.
00:32:26.235,00:32:28.029,-Want to get us together? -No.
00:32:29.781,00:32:31.449,Come in.
00:33:44.022,00:33:45.106,I'll drive today!
00:33:52.238,00:33:55.658,"Anchise, take the afternoon off."
00:35:00.807,00:35:02.558,Sammy! Come on!
00:35:15.613,00:35:17.073,Truce?
00:39:27.323,00:39:30.076,"Sorry, Elio. I brought some clean clothes."
00:39:35.164,00:39:36.624,Leave the door open.
00:39:37.750,00:39:39.418,-Thanks. -You're welcome.
00:42:53.737,00:42:55.656,"Come here, darling."
00:46:05.179,00:46:07.181,I straightened the wheels and inflated the tires.
00:46:07.264,00:46:08.682,Perfect. Thanks.
00:51:02.517,00:51:04.394,"Let's go, American!"
00:52:18.134,00:52:19.719,"Good morning, ma'am."
00:52:21.304,00:52:22.597,Excuse me.
00:52:23.515,00:52:26.226,Could I ask for a glass of water?
00:52:38.321,00:52:40.115,People of Italy!
00:52:46.580,00:52:48.123,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:57:41.916,00:57:45.420,So we got the government of Bettino Craxi...
00:57:45.545,00:57:48.047,"Because we don't do anything but talk, talk, talk."
00:57:48.173,00:57:50.049,Let me speak.
00:57:50.175,00:57:53.678,We have five parties that do nothing but fight.
00:57:53.761,00:57:56.514,"Smoke and shut up! Let them speak, him, her."
00:57:56.723,00:57:59.517,I'd like to know what they think too.
00:57:59.642,00:58:02.437,"Annella, what do you think? A five party government!"
00:58:02.562,00:58:05.732,"Darling, I think it's the historic compromise..."
00:58:05.815,00:58:09.903,Don't say that. Compromises are tragic.
00:58:09.986,00:58:12.780,You've changed since you inherited this place.
00:58:12.906,00:58:14.574,What's that got to do with it?
00:58:14.657,00:58:16.451,What are you saying?
00:58:17.160,00:58:18.828,"You're mad, darling."
00:58:19.662,00:58:20.872,You asshole!
00:58:20.955,00:58:24.834,-She's right. -And you don't say anything to her.
00:58:25.460,00:58:27.587,Say something.
00:58:27.754,00:58:29.380,You're resigned.
00:58:29.464,00:58:32.050,Why don't we talk about the death of Buñuel?
00:58:32.133,00:58:35.178,Buñuel was a genius.
00:58:35.261,00:58:36.888,-Know him? -Cinema isn't the answer.
00:58:36.971,00:58:40.266,Cinema is a mirror of reality and it's a filter.
00:58:41.059,00:58:44.062,They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty with constant interr...
00:58:44.187,00:58:46.648,Everyone loves Buñuel!
00:58:46.814,00:58:48.316,Let's hear his opinion.
00:58:48.399,00:58:50.860,He doesn't know anything about Italy!
00:58:50.985,00:58:52.904,Say something. Give us your impression.
00:58:53.071,00:58:54.572,Do you have an impression?
00:58:54.697,00:58:56.741,"Darling, he's American."
00:58:56.866,00:58:58.201,That doesn't mean stupid!
00:59:04.207,00:59:06.251,Just stop.
00:59:06.376,00:59:10.255,I don't give an easy ride to some politicians.
00:59:10.380,00:59:13.216,She didn't say that.
00:59:13.383,00:59:15.218,I'm going to go mad.
00:59:15.343,00:59:17.178,What's the matter?
00:59:18.429,00:59:20.181,What's wrong?
00:59:20.306,00:59:22.308,It's nothing. It happens all the time.
00:59:22.475,00:59:25.603,"-Mafalda, ice? -It's in the fridge."
00:59:25.812,00:59:28.356,You get used to absolutely everything.
01:00:04.851,01:00:07.895,Don't you realize you're mixing everything up?
01:00:08.021,01:00:09.647,What are you talking about?
01:00:09.772,01:00:12.525,"There's no more politics, nothing. He's left too."
01:02:01.884,01:02:02.885,You okay?
01:02:10.685,01:02:12.019,Are we going out?
01:02:13.771,01:02:17.316,"I don't know if I can go out. If my mom sees, she'll worry."
01:02:17.442,01:02:19.527,"-She will? -Yeah, she's a pain."
01:02:24.949,01:02:26.409,Where's Oliver?
01:02:26.534,01:02:28.077,Don't ask me.
01:02:45.595,01:02:47.013,Where's Oliver?
01:02:48.014,01:02:50.725,-Didn't he go out? -Would you like a smoothie?
01:02:50.892,01:02:53.436,"No, thank you. We're having dinner soon."
01:02:53.561,01:02:54.854,All right.
01:02:54.979,01:02:56.230,I'm going out tonight.
01:02:56.355,01:02:59.650,-Don't make me worry. -What are you talking about?
01:02:59.776,01:03:01.444,"This is no good, madam."
01:03:01.569,01:03:03.654,-Let him do his own thing. -Fine.
01:03:03.780,01:03:05.782,Why's she hassling me? I'm 17.
01:03:05.948,01:03:07.492,She's worried about you.
01:03:12.288,01:03:14.791,"You like him, don't you? Oliver?"
01:03:15.792,01:03:17.627,Everyone likes Oliver.
01:03:18.211,01:03:20.129,I think he likes you too.
01:03:20.254,01:03:21.506,More than you do.
01:03:24.050,01:03:26.010,Is that your impression?
01:03:26.135,01:03:28.971,"-No, he told me. -When did he say that?"
01:03:29.972,01:03:31.349,A while ago.
01:03:55.873,01:03:58.125,"Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?"
01:03:58.251,01:03:59.710,I have no idea.
01:06:33.447,01:06:36.409,This is Craxi. I draw the center of Craxi...
01:06:52.550,01:06:53.926,-Hey. -Hi!
01:06:55.052,01:06:57.722,It's me. Is that Marzia?
01:06:57.847,01:06:59.640,Sure it is! Can't you tell?
01:06:59.765,01:07:00.766,Sorry.
01:07:20.911,01:07:22.121,Is that for me?
01:07:23.622,01:07:24.790,Thanks.
01:07:41.474,01:07:43.684,Do you really read a lot?
01:07:43.851,01:07:46.520,"I love reading too, but I don't tell anyone."
01:07:47.188,01:07:48.773,Why not?
01:07:48.898,01:07:50.191,I don't know.
01:07:52.359,01:07:53.611,I think...
01:07:54.153,01:07:56.655,people who read are...
01:07:57.281,01:07:58.407,kind of secretive.
01:07:59.909,01:08:02.244,They hide who they really are.
01:08:03.621,01:08:05.456,Do you hide who you really are?
01:08:06.248,01:08:07.792,"No, not with you."
01:08:07.958,01:08:09.043,Not with me?
01:08:13.255,01:08:15.299,"Well, maybe a bit."
01:08:15.424,01:08:16.842,What do you mean?
01:08:18.219,01:08:20.513,You know exactly what I mean.
01:08:20.638,01:08:22.306,Why do you say that?
01:08:22.973,01:08:24.058,Why?
01:08:26.352,01:08:27.561,Because...
01:08:28.270,01:08:29.855,I think...
01:08:29.980,01:08:33.818,"you're going to hurt me, and I don't want to be hurt."
01:08:50.751,01:08:52.586,You're so hard.
01:08:58.926,01:09:00.344,Wait.
01:09:00.469,01:09:01.846,Kiss me.
01:09:09.478,01:09:10.938,-Is that good? -Yes.
01:09:12.439,01:09:13.440,Are you lying?
01:09:24.785,01:09:27.621,"-Oh, fuck, I'm sorry. -It's all right."
01:09:27.788,01:09:29.915,Are you mad at me? Are you angry?
01:09:40.467,01:09:43.137,What's so funny? Why are you laughing?
01:09:43.971,01:09:45.472,Leave me alone.
01:09:46.682,01:09:48.309,"Fuck, that felt good."
01:10:48.494,01:10:49.703,Not really.
01:13:43.669,01:13:45.379,I won't be here for dinner.
01:13:45.462,01:13:47.214,"Okay, Mr. Oliver."
01:14:19.121,01:14:20.831,"Hello, Mafalda."
01:14:20.956,01:14:21.957,Marzia.
01:14:25.043,01:14:26.378,Where are we going?
01:14:26.462,01:14:27.713,You'll see.
01:14:42.936,01:14:43.937,Stop it!
01:17:20.052,01:17:22.012,"-How are you, buddy? -Hey!"
01:17:22.137,01:17:24.097,"-It's been ages. -It has, yes."
01:17:24.848,01:17:26.642,-How are you? -You've grown.
01:17:29.561,01:17:31.563,Remember Marzia from last year.
01:17:31.688,01:17:32.731,Hello.
01:17:32.814,01:17:35.150,"-Marzia, remember Isaac? -The girl from Paris?"
01:17:35.275,01:17:36.610,Good to meet you.
01:17:36.735,01:17:38.195,Want to eat with us tonight?
01:17:39.655,01:17:41.365,-You're sure? -Yes.
01:17:43.533,01:17:44.660,Goodbye.
01:33:50.291,01:33:51.959,Times change.
01:33:52.126,01:33:53.836,Thank God we had the partisans.
01:33:54.003,01:33:58.090,"I know, but times have changed. It's different."
01:33:58.215,01:34:00.259,What do you think of Bettino?
01:34:00.384,01:34:03.262,-I don't like him. -I like him.
01:34:03.512,01:34:05.806,"I'm happy, actually."
01:34:08.809,01:34:10.853,I don't know. We'll see.
01:34:13.314,01:34:15.858,"Anyway, they make the rules."
01:34:19.570,01:34:21.072,Pasquina!
01:34:21.155,01:34:22.406,Hello.
01:34:22.531,01:34:23.866,"Hello, ma'am."
01:34:24.825,01:34:26.911,-Tortelli cremaschi. -Yes.
01:42:17.130,01:42:19.049,You disappeared for three days.
01:42:26.515,01:42:28.809,You completely disappeared.
01:42:35.065,01:42:36.608,I had a lot to do.
01:44:48.865,01:44:50.993,Come for dinner tonight.
01:44:51.076,01:44:52.327,Bring Marzia.
01:44:53.912,01:44:55.163,"Bye, darling."
01:48:45.310,01:48:46.811,If you'll excuse me...
01:48:46.937,01:48:48.939,Just one second.
01:48:49.856,01:48:51.274,One second!
01:49:10.877,01:49:12.879,I saw them last year.
01:49:13.713,01:49:16.216,Richard Butler... fantastic!
01:49:16.383,01:49:20.053,Really? We saw them in concert too.
01:49:20.136,01:49:22.973,We hitchhiked to London.
01:53:48.363,01:53:49.572,Mafalda?
01:53:50.573,01:53:51.699,Mom?
01:53:52.825,01:53:54.244,"Yeah, it's me."
01:53:55.578,01:53:57.956,"Yeah, everything is fine. I'm at the station..."
01:53:58.665,01:53:59.999,in Clusone.
01:54:01.876,01:54:03.586,"Listen, Mom, can you..."
01:54:05.213,01:54:07.173,"Can you come get me, Mom?"
01:55:05.899,01:55:08.151,I read the book you bought me.
01:55:08.860,01:55:10.570,The poems...
01:55:10.695,01:55:12.196,They're really beautiful.
01:55:12.322,01:55:15.366,I love that... Antonia Pozzi.
01:55:18.536,01:55:20.538,"I'm sorry, excuse me..."
01:55:20.663,01:55:22.373,that you're sad.
01:55:23.666,01:55:28.379,I'm saying that because I wanted to tell you I'm not mad at you.
01:55:29.964,01:55:31.299,Not at all.
01:55:38.932,01:55:40.224,"I love you, Elio."
01:55:45.647,01:55:46.981,Stay friends?
01:55:49.025,01:55:50.360,For life?
01:55:51.152,01:55:52.445,For life?
01:58:05.411,01:58:07.330,Because it was him.
01:58:08.498,01:58:10.333,Because it was me.
02:03:18.349,02:03:20.935,-Have you been to the Gaverine? -Yes.
02:03:30.861,02:03:32.530,-May I? -Happy Hanukkah!
02:03:32.655,02:03:33.739,To you too.
02:04:19.702,02:04:20.703,Hello?
00:02:49.837,00:02:51.212,The usurper.
00:02:53.090,00:02:55.342,Caro? He's here.
00:03:16.071,00:03:18.281,-Professor Perlman.
00:03:18.323,00:03:20.450,-Thank you so much for having me.
00:03:20.492,00:03:22.201,You're bigger than your picture.
00:03:22.243,00:03:23.578,"Well, I couldn't get all of me in the photo."
00:03:25.914,00:03:27.374,He seems very confident.
00:03:28.167,00:03:29.793,-Mrs. Perlman.
00:03:29.835,00:03:31.170,Oliver. Very nice to meet you.
00:03:31.210,00:03:32.295,-Thank you for having me in your home.
00:03:32.337,00:03:33.672,Where's Elio?
00:03:34.381,00:03:35.549,I'll go down.
00:03:37.467,00:03:39.636,You must be exhausted.
00:03:53.525,00:03:55.569,"Darling, come help Oliver take his things up to his room."
00:03:55.610,00:03:57.779,-He's already here?
00:03:57.821,00:04:00.323,Every single one of these will.
00:04:00.365,00:04:02.283,"Elio, Oliver."
00:04:02.325,00:04:04.119,-How you doing?
00:04:04.161,00:04:05.913,be exhausted.
00:04:05.954,00:04:08.123,-A little bit.
00:04:08.165,00:04:09.791,May I bring your things up to your room?
00:04:09.833,00:04:12.293,"-Uh, sure. Yeah."
00:04:14.379,00:04:16.131,Follow him.
00:04:16.173,00:04:18.466,-You're very welcome here.
00:04:18.508,00:04:20.468,Our home is your home.
00:04:26.641,00:04:28.018,You're leaving?
00:04:28.060,00:04:30.104,-Hello.
00:04:31.980,00:04:33.065,Nice to meet you.
00:04:46.828,00:04:47.871,Oh.
00:04:59.340,00:05:01.760,My room is now your room.
00:05:01.802,00:05:03.095,I'll be next door.
00:05:07.224,00:05:09.309,We have to share the bathroom.
00:05:10.602,00:05:12.187,It's my only way out.
00:06:03.197,00:06:05.364,We're being called for dinner.
00:06:47.157,00:06:48.533,Sorry.
00:06:50.285,00:06:51.494,Yeah.
00:06:51.536,00:06:53.205,We're being called for dinner.
00:06:53.247,00:06:56.917,"Oh, yeah, I'm probably gonna pass."
00:06:56.958,00:06:59.627,"Will you make an excuse for me to your mom, though?"
00:07:01.755,00:07:03.548,"Thanks, man."
00:07:06.176,00:07:07.719,"So, this is your old room, huh?"
00:07:10.389,00:07:11.514,Thanks.
00:07:13.558,00:07:14.642,Later.
00:08:02.774,00:08:04.484,I'll take care of the tart.
00:08:07.612,00:08:10.073,-Wow. Look at this.
00:08:10.115,00:08:11.241,"Good morning, Professor."
00:08:11.283,00:08:12.575,-Good morning.
00:08:12.617,00:08:14.953,-Was I out that long?
00:08:14.995,00:08:17.331,-How are you?
00:08:17.372,00:08:18.873,-Thank you.
00:08:18.915,00:08:20.250,Would you like some espresso?
00:08:20.292,00:08:22.585,Thank you very much.
00:08:22.627,00:08:25.172,This looks amazing.
00:08:25.213,00:08:27.799,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:08:27.841,00:08:29.676,Did you...
00:08:29.717,00:08:31.052,"I did. Yeah, big time."
00:08:31.094,00:08:33.096,-Thank you.
00:08:33.138,00:08:34.639,I could show you around.
00:08:34.681,00:08:36.224,That'd be great.
00:08:36.266,00:08:38.226,Is there a...
00:08:38.268,00:08:40.561,I'd love to start an account while I'm here.
00:08:43.315,00:08:45.400,Sorry.
00:08:45.442,00:08:48.445,-It happens to the best of us.
00:08:48.487,00:08:51.365,None of our residents has ever had a local bank account.
00:08:51.406,00:08:52.824,-Really?
00:08:52.866,00:08:54.868,Should I take him to Montodine?
00:08:54.909,00:08:57.204,I think they're closed for summer vacation.
00:08:57.245,00:08:59.289,You try Crema.
00:08:59.331,00:09:00.790,Crema?
00:09:00.832,00:09:02.709,Thank you.
00:09:02.750,00:09:04.294,Is this your orchard?
00:09:04.336,00:09:06.213,These are Annella's trees.
00:09:06.254,00:09:09.341,"Peaches, cherries, apricots..."
00:09:10.925,00:09:12.219,Pomegranate.
00:09:12.260,00:09:13.303,Melograno.
00:09:15.180,00:09:16.390,Mmm.
00:09:18.225,00:09:19.976,Have another egg.
00:09:20.018,00:09:21.478,"Oh, stupid."
00:09:21.520,00:09:23.688,"No, no, no."
00:09:23.730,00:09:26.900,"If I have a second, I'm just gonna have a third, and then a fourth, and then you're just gonna have to roll me out of here."
00:09:29.486,00:09:31.405,-Delicious.
00:09:33.240,00:09:34.908,Shall I give him Anchise's bike?
00:10:11.570,00:10:14.197,one do around here?
00:10:14.239,00:10:17.117,Wait for the summer to end.
00:10:17.158,00:10:18.410,Yeah?
00:10:18.452,00:10:20.078,What do you do in the winter?
00:10:20.120,00:10:22.997,-Wait for summer to come?
00:10:20.120,00:10:24.665,"-Well, we only come here for Christmas and some other vacations."
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.126,-Christmas?
00:10:26.167,00:10:27.668,-Thought you were Jewish.
00:10:26.167,00:10:30.004,"-Well, we are Jewish, but also American, Italian, French."
00:10:30.046,00:10:32.299,Somewhat atypical combination.
00:10:33.841,00:10:37.304,"Besides my family, you're probably the only other Jew to set foot in this town."
00:10:38.513,00:10:39.931,I'm from a small town in New England.
00:10:39.973,00:10:41.558,I know what it's like to be the odd Jew out.
00:10:43.477,00:10:45.437,"So, what do you do around here?"
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.815,-Just read books.
00:10:48.856,00:10:51.985,Transcribe music.
00:10:52.026,00:10:53.736,-Yeah?
00:10:53.778,00:10:55.947,-I don't know.
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.786,"All right, buddy, thanks for the help."
00:11:10.878,00:11:12.589,Sorry about that.
00:11:12.631,00:11:14.132,It's all right.
00:11:14.174,00:11:15.550,"All right, later."
00:11:26.311,00:11:27.770,What do you have there?
00:11:27.812,00:11:29.814,That should all be...
00:11:33.360,00:11:34.986,"Oh, what is this?"
00:11:35.028,00:11:39.782,These are the continuation of these archaeology department...
00:11:39.824,00:11:41.660,These are archaeology?
00:11:41.700,00:11:42.743,archaeology. The rest of these should be history.
00:11:43.953,00:11:47.165,-More apricot juice?
00:11:47.207,00:11:48.875,"-Here, tesoro."
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.335,"Help yourself, darling."
00:11:50.377,00:11:51.670,Thanks.
00:11:59.802,00:12:02.305,Help yourself to some more.
00:12:02.347,00:12:06.893,The word apricot comes from the Arabic.
00:12:06.934,00:12:10.313,"It's like the words algebra, alchemy, alcohol."
00:12:10.355,00:12:13.816,It derives from an Arabic noun combined with the Arabic article al before it.
00:12:13.858,00:12:19.531,The origin of our Italian albicocca is al-barquq.
00:12:19.573,00:12:26.538,"It's amazing that today in Israel and many Arab countries, the fruit's referred to by a totally different name, Mismish."
00:12:26.580,00:12:28.956,"I may have to disagree with you there, Professor."
00:12:28.998,00:12:30.625,Ah?
00:12:30.667,00:12:33.545,"I'm gonna talk etymology, so just bear with me a second. Um..."
00:12:33.587,00:12:37.507,You're right in the case that most Latin words do find their origins in Greek words.
00:12:37.549,00:12:40.719,"However, in the case of apricot, it's a little bit more of a complicated journey."
00:12:40.759,00:12:42.679,Ah. How so?
00:12:42.721,00:12:45.348,"Well, here, the Greek actually takes over from the Latin."
00:12:45.390,00:12:48.518,"Latin word being, praecoquum or precoquere."
00:12:48.560,00:12:50.353,"So it's, Precook or, Pre-ripen,as you know."
00:12:50.395,00:12:51.605,To be precocious or premature.
00:12:52.731,00:13:02.156,"And the Byzantines, to go on, then borrowed praecox, which became prekokkia, which then became berikokki, which is how the Arabs got al-barquq."
00:13:13.418,00:13:14.753,That's courtesy of Philology 101.
00:13:15.962,00:13:17.464,Flying colors.
00:13:21.217,00:13:22.636,He does this every year.
00:13:38.735,00:13:41.195,It's about drink time.
00:13:42.363,00:13:44.407,"-Ciao, Oliver."
00:13:44.449,00:13:47.034,-How are you?
00:13:52.290,00:13:53.874,"Ciao, boys!"
00:13:53.916,00:13:55.794,All good?
00:13:55.834,00:13:57.545,All good!
00:13:57.587,00:13:59.130,What have we got?
00:13:59.172,00:14:02.008,-Can you start please?
00:14:28.993,00:14:30.537,How do you know about this place?
00:14:32.664,00:14:34.374,Okay.
00:14:40.004,00:14:41.047,"No, no, no, no, no!"
00:14:44.884,00:14:47.387,He's better than the guy who came last year.
00:14:47.428,00:14:49.263,Remember?
00:14:49.305,00:14:50.765,Get in there!
00:14:50.807,00:14:53.685,Much better!
00:15:05.238,00:15:06.906,"Elio, water!"
00:15:08.241,00:15:09.450,Perfect timing.
00:15:13.329,00:15:15.498,Are you all right?
00:15:15.540,00:15:17.751,"-What, pinch a nerve?"
00:15:17.792,00:15:19.711,Here. Hold this.
00:15:19.753,00:15:21.796,Trust me.
00:15:21.838,00:15:23.631,"Hey, hey, come here."
00:15:23.673,00:15:25.132,You're too stressed.
00:15:25.174,00:15:27.510,-You just gotta relax a little bit.
00:15:27.552,00:15:29.220,"Marzia, come here for a minute."
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.181,Back me up here.
00:15:32.223,00:15:33.725,-Feel that. Right there?
00:15:33.767,00:15:34.809,"-It's too tight, right?"
00:15:34.851,00:15:36.227,-He needs to relax.
00:15:36.269,00:15:37.353,Later.
00:15:37.395,00:15:38.938,You should relax more.
00:15:41.190,00:15:42.609,"Okay, guys, ready?"
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.951,"our ball, our ball."
00:15:51.992,00:15:53.411,Twelve serving 11.
00:15:54.370,00:15:56.080,"Mine, mine, mine, mine."
00:15:56.122,00:15:58.291,"Go, go, go. Yeah, good."
00:16:00.668,00:16:04.255,"Sweetheart, Auntie Marcella and the others are coming over for dinner."
00:16:04.297,00:16:06.883,Is Oliver staying with us or going out?
00:16:06.925,00:16:08.426,Don't know.
00:16:09.343,00:16:10.762,What a movie star!
00:16:10.804,00:16:13.598,"Yes, those Americans..."
00:16:36.913,00:16:38.832,Sparkling wine!
00:16:39.666,00:16:41.041,He's late.
00:16:42.418,00:16:44.754,Don't you think...
00:16:44.796,00:16:47.882,"Don't you think he's impolite when he says, Later?"
00:16:48.633,00:16:50.718,Arrogant.
00:16:50.760,00:16:53.095,I don't think he's arrogant.
00:16:53.137,00:16:54.722,Just watch.
00:16:54.764,00:16:56.766,This is how he'll say good-bye to us when the time comes.
00:16:56.808,00:16:59.059,With his... Later.
00:17:00.728,00:17:03.105,"Meanwhile, we'll have to put up with him for six long weeks."
00:17:03.147,00:17:05.232,"Won't we, darling?"
00:17:05.984,00:17:07.902,I think he's shy.
00:17:07.944,00:17:09.320,You'll grow to like him.
00:17:09.362,00:17:10.613,What if I grow to hate him?
00:17:10.655,00:17:11.781,"Oh, no, sweetheart."
00:17:13.992,00:17:16.577,-Take his plates away.
00:17:41.227,00:17:43.813,"Elio, play something."
00:17:46.273,00:17:47.400,Why not?
00:17:47.441,00:17:49.193,Because I don't want to.
00:17:49.235,00:17:51.612,Why don't you go to Moscazzano with others?
00:17:51.654,00:17:53.823,Because I don't want to.
00:17:53.865,00:17:55.575,You're spoiling everyone's fun.
00:18:04.083,00:18:05.710,"Play well, darling."
00:19:38.803,00:19:40.763,-Hey.
00:19:40.805,00:19:42.140,What are you doing?
00:19:42.181,00:19:43.390,Reading.
00:19:45.018,00:19:46.602,How come you're not with everyone else down by the river?
00:19:48.562,00:19:51.024,-I have an allergy. It's...
00:19:52.150,00:19:53.484,Maybe we have the same one.
00:19:53.526,00:19:54.610,Hmm?
00:19:56.696,00:19:58.447,Why don't you and I go swimming?
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.407,-Right now?
00:20:00.449,00:20:02.242,Come on. Let's go.
00:20:03.369,00:20:04.954,Do we have to go right now?
00:20:06.164,00:20:07.874,-I'll go get changed.
00:20:07.915,00:20:09.416,-Meet you downstairs.
00:20:28.186,00:20:29.687,See you downstairs.
00:21:04.388,00:21:06.348,"Elio, what are you doing?"
00:21:06.933,00:21:08.684,Reading my music.
00:21:08.726,00:21:11.145,"No, you're not."
00:21:11.187,00:21:13.480,"-Thinking, then."
00:21:16.525,00:21:17.860,About what?
00:21:20.487,00:21:22.448,It's private.
00:21:22.489,00:21:23.783,You're not gonna tell me?
00:21:23.824,00:21:25.492,I'm not gonna tell you.
00:21:25.534,00:21:27.536,He's not gonna tell me what he's thinking about.
00:21:28.662,00:21:30.497,I guess I'll go hang out with your mom.
00:21:31.540,00:21:33.667,"juice, please."
00:21:36.837,00:21:38.380,Thank God you're helping me.
00:22:03.114,00:22:04.782,didn't like it.
00:22:10.704,00:22:12.165,"Play it again, will you?"
00:22:22.258,00:22:23.259,Follow me.
00:22:55.791,00:22:57.751,That sounds different.
00:22:57.793,00:23:00.629,"-Well, I changed it a little bit."
00:23:00.671,00:23:05.176,I just played it the way Liszt would have played it if he'd altered Bach's version.
00:23:05.218,00:23:06.886,Play that again.
00:23:06.927,00:23:09.138,-Play what again?
00:23:09.180,00:23:11.431,"Oh, you want me to play the thing I played outside?"
00:23:11.473,00:23:14.643,-Please.
00:23:38.209,00:23:39.793,I can't believe you changed it again.
00:23:39.835,00:23:42.420,"-Oh, I changed it a little bit."
00:23:42.462,00:23:46.259,I just played it the way Busoni would've played it if he'd altered Liszt's version.
00:23:46.300,00:23:48.468,And what is wrong with Bach the way Bach would've played...
00:23:48.510,00:23:49.845,Bach never wrote it for the guitar.
00:23:49.887,00:23:51.471,"In fact, we're not even sure Bach wrote it at all."
00:23:51.513,00:23:53.266,Forget I asked.
00:24:23.670,00:24:25.631,It's young Bach.
00:24:25.672,00:24:27.549,He dedicated it to his brother.
00:25:01.208,00:25:02.876,"Hey, Professor."
00:25:02.918,00:25:04.086,Hello.
00:25:04.128,00:25:06.297,"Here, please."
00:25:06.339,00:25:07.923,I need help.
00:25:11.093,00:25:12.761,How bad is it?
00:25:12.803,00:25:16.223,"your insights here are persuasive, but..."
00:25:16.265,00:25:17.975,-Ciao.
00:25:19.935,00:25:21.895,Have you been to the river?
00:25:38.162,00:25:39.497,Isn't she beautiful?
00:25:59.599,00:26:01.643,-Mmm.
00:26:01.685,00:26:03.103,You sleeping?
00:26:04.562,00:26:05.939,I was.
00:26:05.981,00:26:08.650,Listen to this drivel.
00:26:09.485,00:26:12.238,-Wait.
00:26:12.279,00:26:13.780,Can't hear you.
00:26:24.124,00:26:32.258,"Heidegger contends, this underlying hiddenness is constitutive of the way beings are, not only in relation to themselves but also in relation to other entities generally."
00:26:32.299,00:26:37.763,"In other words, they do not construe hiddenness merely or primarily in terms of entities' relations to human beings."
00:26:39.139,00:26:41.434,Does that make any sense to you?
00:26:41.475,00:26:43.685,Doesn't make any sense to me.
00:26:43.727,00:26:45.687,"I don't think it makes any sense to your dad, either."
00:26:47.189,00:26:48.899,Maybe it did when you wrote it.
00:26:53.695,00:26:57.199,That might be the kindest thing anybody has said to me in months.
00:26:57.241,00:26:58.409,Kind?
00:26:59.159,00:27:01.328,Yep. Kind.
00:27:28.481,00:27:30.232,"-Hey, Elio."
00:27:30.274,00:27:31.691,Hey!
00:27:34.487,00:27:35.653,Come here.
00:27:37.990,00:27:39.450,What's going on?
00:27:39.492,00:27:41.368,Is he trying to get it on with her?
00:27:41.410,00:27:43.537,"Elio, he already succeeded?"
00:27:45.456,00:27:46.915,What do I know?
00:27:46.957,00:27:48.666,I'd love to be in his shoes.
00:27:48.708,00:27:50.628,Who wouldn't love to be in her shoes?
00:27:53.088,00:27:55.341,"She wants him, no matter what!"
00:28:39.593,00:28:40.760,Coming?
00:28:43.096,00:28:44.431,I'll come later.
00:30:00.006,00:30:02.760,Are you mad with me because you are mad with Chiara?
00:30:02.801,00:30:04.470,Why would I be mad at Chiara?
00:30:05.679,00:30:07.222,Because of him.
00:30:07.264,00:30:08.724,Because of who?
00:30:09.891,00:30:11.143,Of Oliver.
00:30:22.655,00:30:24.030,Turn around.
00:30:38.671,00:30:40.506,Meet me here tomorrow night?
00:30:47.387,00:30:49.723,Wait for me!
00:30:49.765,00:30:51.308,Come on.
00:31:05.113,00:31:06.865,We almost had sex last night...
00:31:06.906,00:31:08.492,Marzia and me.
00:31:09.618,00:31:12.037,"Hmm? Well, why didn't you?"
00:31:13.330,00:31:16.082,I don't know.
00:31:16.124,00:31:18.877,"Well, you know, it's better to have tried and failed, right?"
00:31:18.918,00:31:22.756,All I had to do was find the courage to reach out and touch.
00:31:22.798,00:31:24.383,She would have said yes.
00:31:24.424,00:31:25.967,"Well, try again later."
00:31:26.009,00:31:28.094,Try what later?
00:31:28.136,00:31:29.847,I just heard from the people in Sirmione.
00:31:29.888,00:31:31.640,They say they've come up with something.
00:31:31.682,00:31:33.933,Oh! Fantastic.
00:31:33.975,00:31:35.644,Going there today.
00:31:35.686,00:31:38.146,-Would you like to come along?
00:31:39.939,00:31:41.775,"-Can I come, too?"
00:31:41.817,00:31:44.986,"Ah, on the condition you remain silent."
00:31:45.028,00:31:49.783,"Silent as in, He has too many opinions, or silent as in, Just not telling anybody what an amazing thing you've dug up?"
00:31:49.825,00:31:51.410,"Well, nothing has been dug up."
00:31:51.451,00:31:54.413,"It's what has been brought out, out of the water."
00:31:56.623,00:31:58.124,"Ciao, Chiara!"
00:32:02.838,00:32:04.381,What are you doing?
00:32:04.423,00:32:06.216,Going to Lake Garda with my dad.
00:32:06.258,00:32:09.177,He wants to show Oliver where he's dredging.
00:32:09.219,00:32:11.680,Can you tell him I came by?
00:32:11.722,00:32:13.599,"He's inside with my dad, helping him."
00:32:15.434,00:32:18.771,"You were amazing last night, on the dance floor."
00:32:18.812,00:32:20.814,-He's a good dancer.
00:32:23.024,00:32:24.860,"He's good-looking, too."
00:32:26.194,00:32:28.405,-Want to get us together?
00:32:29.865,00:32:31.533,Come in.
00:33:08.278,00:33:10.864,Dad always sits up front with Anchise to navigate.
00:33:18.413,00:33:20.916,She seems to like you a lot.
00:33:20.958,00:33:23.627,She's more beautiful than she was last year.
00:33:25.044,00:33:27.756,I saw her naked on a night swim once.
00:33:28.590,00:33:30.676,Great body.
00:33:30.717,00:33:32.177,Trying to get me to like her?
00:33:32.218,00:33:34.304,What would be the harm in that?
00:33:34.346,00:33:36.139,"No, no harm."
00:33:36.181,00:33:38.558,"Just typically like to go at those things on my own, if you don't mind."
00:33:44.063,00:33:45.774,I'll drive today!
00:33:48.443,00:33:50.445,Just don't play at being the good host.

00:36:21.972,00:36:26.893,We're all such pros.
00:36:41.074,00:36:43.118,I have to go.
00:36:43.160,00:36:44.870,I have to go.
00:36:46.538,00:36:48.206,Goodness.
00:36:52.002,00:36:54.337,"-Are you going, too?"
00:36:54.379,00:36:56.506,I should stay and do some work on my book.
00:36:56.548,00:36:59.885,Come on. How about a drink to celebrate the day?
00:36:59.926,00:37:02.012,"-Okay, maybe just one."

00:39:30.243,00:39:31.286,Mmm.
00:39:35.248,00:39:36.708,Leave the door open.
00:39:37.834,00:39:39.502,-Thanks.
00:42:28.296,00:42:30.215,"Darling, have you seen my Heptaméron?"

00:42:39.307,00:42:40.766,It's in German.
00:42:43.395,00:42:44.437,Okay.
00:42:46.772,00:42:50.568,"I can't remember where we left off, but I think you'll like this one."
00:42:53.821,00:42:55.740,"Come here, darling."
00:42:57.700,00:42:59.494,"So, I'll translate, huh?"
00:43:08.753,00:43:13.049,A handsome young knight is madly in love with a princess.
00:43:13.091,00:43:19.722,"And she, too, is in love with him, though she seems not to be entirely aware of it."
00:43:20.765,00:43:22.850,Despite the friendship...
00:43:24.977,00:43:35.821,"...that blossoms between them, or perhaps because of that very friendship, the young knight finds himself so..."
00:43:38.824,00:43:47.041,...so humbled and speechless that he's totally unable to bring up the subject of his love.
00:43:47.083,00:43:50.795,"Till one day, he asks the princess point-blank..."
00:44:02.140,00:44:04.309,Is it better to speak or to die?
00:44:09.688,00:44:12.733,I'd never have the courage to ask a question like that.
00:44:14.319,00:44:15.570,I doubt that.
00:44:20.325,00:44:22.701,"Hey, Elly-Belly."
00:44:24.496,00:44:26.664,You do know that you can always talk to us.

00:44:44.599,00:44:46.100,does he or doesn't he?
00:44:48.102,00:44:49.895,"Better to speak, she said."
00:44:51.856,00:44:53.608,But she's on her guard.
00:44:54.984,00:44:56.902,She senses a trap somewhere.
00:45:03.868,00:45:05.161,"So, does he speak?"
00:45:06.412,00:45:07.497,No.
00:45:09.790,00:45:11.876,-He fudges.
00:45:13.002,00:45:14.212,It figures.
00:45:14.253,00:45:15.380,He's French.
00:45:21.636,00:45:24.055,I gotta go to town in a little bit to pick some things up.

00:45:30.311,00:45:31.604,Right now?
00:45:31.646,00:45:34.899,Yeah. Right now.
00:45:34.940,00:45:37.360,"That is, of course, unless you have more important business going on."
00:45:52.083,00:45:53.125,Mind if I put this in your bag?
00:45:53.167,00:45:54.168,"Yes, please."
00:46:05.513,00:46:07.306,I straightened the wheels and inflated the tires.
00:46:07.348,00:46:08.765,Perfect. Thanks.
00:46:12.687,00:46:15.565,"I was coming home the other day, and I scraped myself pretty badly."
00:46:15.607,00:46:18.401,Anchise insisted on applying some sort of witches' brew.
00:46:18.443,00:46:19.818,I think it helped.
00:46:44.176,00:46:45.553,"Hold this for a second, will you?"
00:47:05.364,00:47:06.699,-Want one?
00:47:31.641,00:47:32.725,"Not bad, huh?"
00:47:33.518,00:47:34.644,Not bad at all.
00:47:37.689,00:47:38.981,I thought you didn't smoke.
00:47:40.608,00:47:41.693,I don't.
00:47:47.281,00:47:51.076,"-So, World War II, huh?"
00:47:51.118,00:47:53.579,You'd have to be at least 80 years old to have known any of them.
00:47:54.747,00:47:56.873,I never even heard of the Battle of Piave.
00:47:56.915,00:47:59.544,Battle of Piave was one of the most lethal battles of World War I.
00:48:00.211,00:48:01.920,"170,000 people died."
00:48:03.464,00:48:05.299,Is there anything you don't know?
00:48:09.094,00:48:10.596,"I know nothing, Oliver."
00:48:15.810,00:48:17.645,"Well, you seem to know more than anybody else around here."
00:48:17.687,00:48:20.022,"Well, if you only knew how little I know about the things that matter."
00:48:23.275,00:48:24.652,What things that matter?
00:48:31.950,00:48:33.327,You know what things.
00:48:40.292,00:48:41.627,Why are you telling me this?
00:48:46.006,00:48:47.258,'Cause I thought you should know.
00:48:49.093,00:48:51.470,Because you thought I should know?
00:48:53.723,00:48:55.140,'Cause I wanted you to know?
00:48:58.603,00:49:00.897,Because I wanted you to know.
00:49:04.650,00:49:06.402,Because I wanted you to know.
00:49:11.657,00:49:13.618,'Cause I wanted you to know.
00:49:24.545,00:49:27.381,Because there's no one else I can say this to but you.
00:49:34.012,00:49:35.807,Are you saying what I think you're saying?
00:49:43.522,00:49:46.983,Don't go anywhere.
00:49:47.025,00:49:48.653,You know I'm not going anywhere.
00:50:18.098,00:50:19.684,They mixed up all of my pages.
00:50:19.725,00:50:22.311,I'm gonna have to retype this whole thing.
00:50:22.353,00:50:23.855,I'm not gonna have anything to work on this afternoon.
00:50:23.896,00:50:25.397,-This is gonna set me back a whole day.
00:50:26.190,00:50:28.609,Damn it.
00:50:28.651,00:50:30.486,I shouldn't have said anything.
00:50:30.528,00:50:32.112,Just pretend you never did.
00:50:32.154,00:50:34.239,What does that mean?
00:50:37.785,00:50:42.414,"It means, we can't talk about those kinds of things Okay?"
00:50:44.124,00:50:46.042,We just can't.
00:51:00.599,00:51:01.642,Hey!
00:51:02.643,00:51:04.896,"Let's go, American!"
00:51:25.499,00:51:27.001,-Let's go.
00:52:02.787,00:52:03.955,Pretty much.
00:52:14.256,00:52:16.050,-You thirsty?
00:52:18.094,00:52:19.887,"Good morning, ma'am."
00:52:21.055,00:52:23.139,Excuse me.
00:52:23.181,00:52:26.268,Could I ask for a glass of water?
00:52:36.737,00:52:38.238,Il Duce.
00:52:38.280,00:52:42.701,People of Italy That's Italy.
00:52:46.497,00:52:48.415,-Thank you.
00:53:49.852,00:53:52.646,This is my spot.
00:53:54.398,00:53:57.193,I come here to read.
00:53:57.233,00:53:59.444,I can't tell you the number of books I've read here.
00:54:01.947,00:54:04.116,"Oh, my God."
00:54:05.241,00:54:07.161,The spring is in the mountains.
00:54:07.745,00:54:09.163,The Alpi Orobie.
00:54:10.497,00:54:11.874,The water comes straight down from there.
00:54:38.025,00:54:40.236,the way you say things.
00:54:40.276,00:54:42.780,"I don't know why you're always putting yourself down, though."
00:54:42.821,00:54:45.157,I guess?
00:54:49.078,00:54:50.913,You really that afraid of what I think?
00:55:04.218,00:55:06.011,very difficult for me.
00:55:18.649,00:55:20.525,"I love this, Oliver."
00:55:26.073,00:55:27.283,What?
00:55:31.495,00:55:32.621,Everything.
00:55:37.668,00:55:39.044,"Us, you mean?"
00:55:40.712,00:55:42.298,"Eh, it's not bad."
00:55:43.257,00:55:44.300,It's not bad.
00:56:39.271,00:56:40.356,Better now?
00:56:47.403,00:56:48.780,Mmm-mmm.
00:56:48.822,00:56:51.075,"No, no, no."
00:56:52.076,00:56:54.203,-We should go.
00:56:54.245,00:56:57.122,I know myself. Okay?
00:56:57.164,00:56:59.791,"We haven't done anything to be ashamed of, and that's a good thing."
00:57:00.500,00:57:01.668,I wanna be good.
00:57:02.336,00:57:03.337,Okay?
00:57:10.261,00:57:11.970,Am I offending you?
00:57:18.852,00:57:20.020,Just don't.
00:57:27.152,00:57:29.321,I think it's starting to get infected.
00:57:31.240,00:57:32.908,We can stop by the pharmacist's on the way back.
00:57:33.533,00:57:34.826,Excellent idea.
00:57:42.000,00:57:45.587,So we got the government of Bettino Craxi...
00:57:45.629,00:57:48.215,"Because we don't do anything but talk, talk, talk."
00:57:48.257,00:57:50.217,Let me speak.
00:57:50.259,00:57:53.804,We have five parties that do nothing but fight.
00:57:53.845,00:57:56.765,Smoke and shut up!
00:57:56.807,00:57:59.684,I'd like to know what they think too.
00:57:59.726,00:58:02.604,"Annella, what do you think?"
00:58:02.646,00:58:05.857,"Darling, I think it's the historic compromise..."
00:58:05.899,00:58:10.028,Don't say that.
00:58:10.070,00:58:12.948,You've changed since you inherited this place.
00:58:12.990,00:58:14.699,What's that got to do with it?
00:58:14.741,00:58:16.534,What are you saying?
00:58:17.244,00:58:18.912,"You're mad, darling."
00:58:19.746,00:58:21.081,You asshole!
00:58:21.123,00:58:24.918,-She's right.
00:58:25.543,00:58:27.421,Say something.
00:58:27.463,00:58:29.547,You're resigned.
00:58:29.589,00:58:32.176,Why don't we talk about the death of Bunuel?
00:58:36.930,00:58:40.476,Cinema is a mirror of reality and it's a filter.
00:58:40.517,00:58:44.146,They broadcast The Phantom of Liberty with constant interr...
00:58:44.188,00:58:51.028,Everyone loves Bunuel Let's hear his opinion He doesn't know anything about Italy!
00:58:51.069,00:58:53.113,Say something.
00:58:53.155,00:58:54.739,Do you have an impression?
00:58:54.781,00:58:56.908,"Darling, he's American."
00:58:56.950,00:58:58.285,That doesn't mean stupid!
00:59:04.291,00:59:06.418,Just stop.
00:59:06.460,00:59:10.422,I don't give an easy ride to some politicians.
00:59:10.464,00:59:13.425,She didn't say that.
00:59:13.467,00:59:15.386,I'm going to go mad.
00:59:15.427,00:59:17.262,What's the matter?
00:59:18.514,00:59:20.349,What's wrong?
00:59:20.391,00:59:22.518,It's nothing.
00:59:22.559,00:59:25.854,"-Mafalda, ice?"
00:59:25.896,00:59:28.440,You get used to absolutely everything.
01:00:04.893,01:00:08.146,Don't you realize you're mixing everything up?
01:00:08.188,01:00:10.190,What are you talking about?
01:00:10.232,01:00:12.568,"-There's no more politics, nothing."
01:00:19.241,01:00:20.867,Elio?
01:00:20.909,01:00:22.160,You all right?
01:00:23.370,01:00:24.621,Sit for a second.
01:00:27.040,01:00:28.208,If you insist...
01:00:32.670,01:00:34.423,"That wasn't my fault, right?"
01:00:34.465,01:00:35.591,No.
01:00:37.509,01:00:38.885,I'm a mess.
01:00:42.222,01:00:45.225,"Well, the kitchen table sure is."
01:00:50.772,01:00:53.317,Ow! Where'd you learn to do that?
01:00:53.358,01:00:56.194,My bubby used to do this for us when we were sick.
01:00:56.236,01:00:57.821,"Trust me, it helps."
01:01:02.784,01:01:04.620,I used to have one of these.
01:01:04.661,01:01:06.830,-You used to?
01:01:06.871,01:01:08.706,How come you never wear it?
01:01:08.748,01:01:11.502,My mother says we are Jews of discretion.
01:01:12.210,01:01:13.211,Well...
01:01:14.421,01:01:16.298,I guess that works for your mother.
01:01:17.341,01:01:18.716,Funny witch.
01:01:24.181,01:01:26.266,"Fuck, you'll kill me if you do that."
01:01:26.308,01:01:28.143,I hope not.
01:01:38.612,01:01:40.197,"Hey, are you leaving?"
01:01:40.238,01:01:42.073,-Where's Elio?
01:01:42.115,01:01:44.368,"He had a bit of a nosebleed during lunch, and he's just resting."
01:01:44.409,01:01:46.119,-Really?
01:01:46.161,01:01:47.829,-Okay. I'll be back in a minute.
01:01:47.871,01:01:49.498,Don't go anywhere.
01:02:01.968,01:02:02.969,You okay?
01:02:10.727,01:02:12.062,Are we going out?
01:02:13.855,01:02:17.526,I don't know if I can go out.
01:02:17.568,01:02:19.611,-She will?
01:02:25.033,01:02:26.535,Where's Oliver?
01:02:45.679,01:02:48.098,Where's Oliver?
01:02:48.139,01:02:50.934,-Didn't he go out?
01:02:50.975,01:02:53.604,"No, thank you."
01:02:53.645,01:02:55.021,All right.
01:02:55.063,01:02:56.481,I'm going out tonight.
01:02:56.523,01:02:59.817,-Don't make me worry.
01:02:59.859,01:03:01.612,"This is no good, madam."
01:03:01.653,01:03:03.821,-Let him do his own thing.
01:03:03.863,01:03:05.990,Why's she hassling me?
01:03:06.032,01:03:07.576,She's worried about you.
01:03:12.372,01:03:14.874,"You like him, don't you? Oliver?"
01:03:15.875,01:03:18.253,Everyone likes Oliver.
01:03:18.295,01:03:20.297,"I think he likes you, too."
01:03:20.338,01:03:21.590,More than you do.
01:03:24.134,01:03:26.177,Is that your impression?
01:03:26.219,01:03:29.055,"-No, he told me."
01:03:30.056,01:03:31.433,A while ago.
01:03:55.957,01:03:58.293,"Mafalda, do you know where Oliver is?"
01:03:58.335,01:03:59.795,I have no idea.
01:06:17.849,01:06:19.058,Traitor.
01:06:52.550,01:06:53.927,-Hey.
01:06:55.052,01:06:57.806,It's me. Is that Marzia?
01:06:57.848,01:06:59.724,Can't you tell?
01:06:59.766,01:07:00.767,Sorry.
01:07:23.623,01:07:24.791,Thanks.
01:07:41.474,01:07:43.810,read a lot?
01:07:43.852,01:07:46.521,"I love reading too, but I don't tell anyone."
01:07:47.188,01:07:48.857,Why not?
01:07:52.360,01:07:54.111,I think...
01:07:54.153,01:07:56.656,people who read are...
01:07:57.281,01:07:58.408,kind of secretive.
01:07:59.910,01:08:02.245,They hide who they really are.
01:08:06.249,01:08:07.918,"No, not with you."
01:08:07.959,01:08:09.044,Not with me?
01:08:22.974,01:08:24.059,Why?
01:08:26.352,01:08:27.562,Because...
01:08:28.271,01:08:29.940,I think...
01:08:50.752,01:08:52.587,You're so hard.
01:08:58.927,01:09:00.428,Wait.
01:09:27.789,01:09:29.916,Are you angry?
01:09:40.468,01:09:43.138,What's so funny?
01:09:43.972,01:09:45.473,Leave me alone.
01:09:56.359,01:09:57.986,Please don't avoid me.
01:09:58.028,01:10:00.155,It kills me.
01:10:00.196,01:10:02.615,Your silence is killing me.
01:10:02.657,01:10:03.950,I am such a pussy.
01:10:07.203,01:10:08.496,Way over the top.
01:10:18.882,01:10:20.884,Can't stand the silence.
01:10:21.801,01:10:23.344,Need to speak to you.
01:10:45.742,01:10:48.452,a good night last night?
01:10:48.494,01:10:50.371,-Mm.
01:10:54.167,01:10:56.794,"Well, you must be tired, then."
01:10:56.836,01:10:58.922,"Or were you playing poker, too?"
01:10:58.963,01:11:01.632,I don't play poker.
01:11:01.674,01:11:06.596,Several hundred color slides of our boxer and the others like him arrived yesterday from Berlin.
01:11:06.637,01:11:08.723,We should start cataloging them.
01:11:08.765,01:11:10.558,"That'll keep us busy till lunch, I imagine."
01:11:10.600,01:11:11.684,Sure.
01:11:14.478,01:11:16.189,"Beautiful, aren't they?"
01:11:18.566,01:11:20.526,They're all so incredibly sensual.
01:11:20.568,01:11:23.905,Because these are more Hellenistic than 5th century Athenian.
01:11:23.947,01:11:27.575,under the influence of Praxiteles.
01:11:29.119,01:11:30.286,Right.
01:11:32.455,01:11:34.916,Greatest sculptor in antiquity.
01:11:58.397,01:12:00.608,I'll see you at midnight.
01:12:11.244,01:12:14.080,I'll see you at midnight.
01:12:17.333,01:12:20.544,"Look at his stomach, for example."
01:12:20.586,01:12:23.923,Not a straight body in these statues.
01:12:23.965,01:12:27.969,Sometimes impossibly curved.
01:12:28.011,01:12:31.181,Hence their ageless ambiguity.
01:12:31.222,01:12:33.891,As if they're daring you to desire them.
01:12:54.162,01:12:56.289,"Don't forget, Isaac and Mounir are coming for dinner."
01:12:56.331,01:12:59.917,-Also known as Sonny and Cher.
01:12:59.959,01:13:02.419,I'd like you to wear that shirt they gave you for your birthday.
01:13:02.461,01:13:04.339,No.
01:13:04.380,01:13:05.840,"Darling, they got it for you in Miami."
01:13:05.882,01:13:07.591,I'm sorry.
01:13:07.633,01:13:09.219,-Come on.
01:13:09.260,01:13:10.553,I'll try it on for Oliver.
01:13:10.594,01:13:13.348,"If Oliver thinks I look like a scarecrow in it, I'm not wearing it."
01:13:13.389,01:13:14.515,Oliver?
01:13:16.351,01:13:17.894,"Hey, what time you got?"
01:13:18.602,01:13:19.979,It's 2:00.
01:13:24.150,01:13:27.320,-Well... Later.
01:13:39.415,01:13:40.499,Mafalda.
01:13:43.669,01:13:45.421,I won't be here for dinner.
01:13:45.462,01:13:47.215,"Okay, Mr. Oliver."
01:13:51.052,01:13:52.970,-Ciao.
01:14:19.122,01:14:20.915,"Hello, Mafalda."
01:14:20.957,01:14:21.958,Marzia.
01:14:25.044,01:14:26.421,Where are we going?
01:14:42.937,01:14:43.938,Stop it!
01:17:20.052,01:17:22.096,"-How are you, buddy?"
01:17:22.138,01:17:24.807,-It's been ages.
01:17:24.848,01:17:27.143,-How are you?
01:17:27.184,01:17:28.227,-How are you.
01:17:28.269,01:17:29.645,Good to see you.
01:17:29.686,01:17:31.647,Remember Marzia from last year.
01:17:31.688,01:17:32.898,Hello.
01:17:32.940,01:17:35.234,"-Marzia, remember Issac?"
01:17:35.276,01:17:36.693,Good to meet you.
01:17:36.735,01:17:38.237,Want to eat with us tonight?
01:17:38.279,01:17:39.614,"No, no. I have to go."
01:17:39.655,01:17:41.407,-Yes.
01:17:41.449,01:17:43.493,-Have a nice evening.
01:17:50.040,01:17:54.711,This right here is the brand-new china that you guys so kindly sent to us.
01:17:54.753,01:17:57.298,It looks wonderful.
01:17:57.340,01:17:58.674,"-Come, come, come."
01:18:00.801,01:18:02.637,I can't put it on now.
01:18:02.678,01:18:04.054,"-Yes, you can."
01:18:04.096,01:18:05.681,"-Papa, it'll..."
01:18:05.722,01:18:08.058,"-Papa, it'll look like a put-up job."
01:18:08.100,01:18:11.103,No... No laughing.
01:18:11.145,01:18:13.689,You're too old not to accept people for who they are.
01:18:13.730,01:18:15.650,What's wrong with them?
01:18:15.691,01:18:17.652,You call them Sonny and Cher behind their backs.
01:18:17.734,01:18:20.821,-That's what Mom calls them...
01:18:20.863,01:18:23.115,The only person that reflects badly on is you.
01:18:23.157,01:18:25.784,Is it because they're gay or because they're ridiculous?
01:18:28.329,01:18:33.459,"If you know as much about economics at Mounir's age, you'll be a very wise man, indeed."
01:18:33.501,01:18:36.420,And a credit to me.
01:18:36.462,01:18:39.215,"Now, just get into this, you."
01:18:48.015,01:18:51.686,These are unbelievable.
01:18:54.313,01:18:55.981,"Hey, look who's here."
01:19:43.362,01:19:46.865,Sorry. I have to go to bed.
01:19:49.118,01:19:51.245,Elio. Elio.
01:19:53.205,01:19:55.165,-Thank you.
01:19:55.207,01:19:56.542,Good night.
01:20:20.232,01:20:22.151,for everything.
01:20:28.658,01:20:30.701,-They're never gonna make it.
01:21:11.701,01:21:12.827,I'm glad you came.
01:21:24.087,01:21:25.339,"Yeah, I'm nervous."
01:22:04.503,01:22:06.338,I like what you've done with the place.
01:22:08.382,01:22:09.466,It's nice.
01:22:36.869,01:22:38.120,You okay?
01:22:43.667,01:22:44.794,Me okay.
01:23:11.403,01:23:13.280,-Can I kiss you?
01:24:29.147,01:24:30.482,Does this make you happy?
01:24:32.234,01:24:34.194,"You're not gonna get a nosebleed on me, are you?"
01:24:34.236,01:24:35.863,I'm not gonna get...
01:25:05.768,01:25:07.811,"Off, off, off, off, off."
01:25:11.231,01:25:12.608,Yeah. Just pull it.
01:25:14.944,01:25:16.194,Or I'll pull it.
01:26:29.643,01:26:32.688,"Call me by your name, and I'll call you by mine."
01:26:36.525,01:26:37.609,Elio.
01:26:40.154,01:26:41.571,Oliver.
01:26:44.700,01:26:45.701,Elio.
01:26:47.285,01:26:49.454,-Oliver.
01:27:02.718,01:27:04.678,Did we make noise?
01:27:04.720,01:27:06.221,Nothing to worry about.
01:27:06.262,01:27:09.224,I don't know.
01:27:09.265,01:27:10.851,"Well, she's not gonna find any."
01:27:18.692,01:27:20.903,the first day you were here.
01:27:22.362,01:27:23.906,Will you give it to me when you go?
01:28:35.227,01:28:36.478,Let's go swimming.
01:29:29.447,01:29:32.117,Are you gonna hold what happened last night against me?
01:29:32.492,01:29:33.576,No.
01:30:43.021,01:30:45.315,Elio. Come here.
01:30:50.987,01:30:52.364,Take your trunks off.
01:31:08.213,01:31:09.631,"Well, that's promising."
01:31:09.672,01:31:10.924,You're hard again.
01:31:10.966,01:31:12.008,Good.
01:31:56.636,01:31:58.721,"Professor, I got your note."
01:31:58.763,01:32:02.476,"I'm gonna go into town and pick up those typed pages today, so maybe this afternoon would be a good time to..."
01:32:03.559,01:32:04.894,Later.
01:32:07.481,01:32:09.274,"We'll look them over later, before you leave."
01:32:09.316,01:32:12.486,"Okay. So, later."
01:32:12.568,01:32:13.569,Later.
01:32:25.707,01:32:26.791,Oliver.
01:32:37.635,01:32:39.721,sick of me yet?
01:32:39.762,01:32:41.973,"No, I just..."
01:32:45.810,01:32:48.146,I'll... I'm gonna...
01:32:49.731,01:32:51.649,Do you know how happy I am that we slept together?
01:32:54.110,01:32:55.153,I don't know.
01:32:56.779,01:32:58.198,"Of course, you don't know."
01:33:00.158,01:33:02.952,I don't want you to regret anything.
01:33:02.994,01:33:05.914,And I hate the thought that maybe I may have messed you up or...
01:33:07.207,01:33:09.625,"I don't want either of us to pay for this, -one way or another."
01:33:09.667,01:33:12.712,It's not like I'm gonna tell anyone.
01:33:12.754,01:33:15.090,"You're not gonna be, like, getting in trouble."
01:33:15.131,01:33:16.674,That's not what I'm talking about.
01:33:28.686,01:33:29.979,Are you happy I came here?
01:33:36.903,01:33:38.612,I would kiss you if I could.
01:33:50.292,01:33:52.085,Times change.
01:33:52.127,01:33:53.962,we had the partisans.
01:33:54.003,01:33:58.174,have changed. It's different.
01:33:58.216,01:34:00.343,think of Bettino?
01:34:19.571,01:34:21.114,Pasquina!
01:34:21.156,01:34:22.491,Hello.
01:35:50.495,01:35:51.829,"Oh, fuck."
01:37:26.466,01:37:27.592,Fuck.
01:38:43.334,01:38:44.460,What did you do?
01:38:45.545,01:38:47.088,-Nothing.
01:38:55.388,01:38:57.807,"Oh, I see."
01:38:57.849,01:39:00.268,You've moved on to the plant kingdom already.
01:39:00.309,01:39:01.811,What's next? Minerals?
01:39:01.853,01:39:03.354,I suppose you've already given up animals.
01:39:03.396,01:39:04.439,You know that's me.
01:39:05.523,01:39:07.316,"I'm sick, aren't I?"
01:39:10.361,01:39:12.238,I wish everybody was as sick as you.
01:39:13.448,01:39:14.908,Please don't do that.
01:39:14.948,01:39:16.409,-You want to see something sick?
01:39:16.451,01:39:17.577,You want to see something sick?
01:39:17.619,01:39:18.745,Please don't do this.
01:39:18.787,01:39:19.913,Hey. Please don't do it.
01:39:25.167,01:39:26.335,Why are you doing this to me?
01:39:27.796,01:39:29.130,-What are you doing?
01:39:29.171,01:39:31.382,-You're fucking hurting me.
01:39:54.363,01:39:55.448,Sorry.
01:39:56.282,01:39:57.325,It's okay.
01:40:03.539,01:40:04.998,It's okay.
01:40:17.261,01:40:18.387,It's okay.
01:40:19.555,01:40:21.014,I don't want you to go.
01:40:24.727,01:40:27.772,we wasted so many days.
01:40:27.814,01:40:29.064,Why didn't you give me a sign?
01:40:29.106,01:40:30.900,-I did. I did.
01:40:30.942,01:40:33.068,When?
01:40:33.110,01:40:36.698,You remember when we were playing volleyball and I touched you?
01:40:38.366,01:40:42.662,Just to show you that I liked you?
01:40:42.704,01:40:45.665,And the way you reacted made me feel like I'd molested you.
01:40:45.707,01:40:47.040,-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:40:47.082,01:40:49.126,I just decided I should keep my distance.
01:40:51.044,01:40:52.338,I don't know.
01:40:56.968,01:40:59.136,I come out here for hours almost every night.
01:41:00.596,01:41:01.639,I didn't know that.
01:41:04.475,01:41:05.810,"That's funny, I..."
01:41:06.811,01:41:08.563,I thought that...
01:41:08.604,01:41:10.356,"Yeah, I know what you thought."
01:41:10.398,01:41:12.400,Stop. Stop.
01:41:49.896,01:41:51.230,For Oliver.
01:41:52.314,01:41:53.691,From Elio.
01:42:17.130,01:42:19.050,You disappeared for three days.
01:42:24.097,01:42:25.389,I had to work.
01:42:26.515,01:42:28.810,You completely disappeared.
01:42:30.269,01:42:32.271,"Yeah, I don't know. I just..."
01:42:35.066,01:42:36.609,I had a lot to do.
01:42:46.661,01:42:47.954,Am I your girl?
01:43:10.768,01:43:13.729,Oliver has to go to Bergamo for a few days.
01:43:13.771,01:43:14.939,Oh?
01:43:14.981,01:43:16.774,Research at the university.
01:43:17.859,01:43:20.569,Then he'll fly home from Linate.
01:43:21.612,01:43:22.947,But what about Elio?
01:43:25.616,01:43:30.121,"Maybe it could be nice for the two of them to get away for a couple of days, no?"
01:43:34.458,01:43:35.710,What do you think?
01:43:38.253,01:43:40.506,You know you've been our favorite student?
01:43:40.548,01:43:42.508,-You must come back.
01:43:42.550,01:43:44.635,-Oliver.
01:43:46.721,01:43:48.221,"Oh, man."
01:43:50.016,01:43:51.559,"Please, please come back soon."
01:43:51.600,01:43:53.435,Come back? I'm just going home to pack.
01:43:55.063,01:43:56.189,You're welcome.
01:43:57.356,01:43:59.316,"Oh, well..."
01:43:59.358,01:44:01.234,-Thank you guys so much.
01:44:01.276,01:44:02.611,"Oliver, Oliver."
01:44:03.821,01:44:05.656,-Come back.
01:44:05.698,01:44:06.991,"Come here, come here."
01:44:07.033,01:44:09.410,It's been amazing.
01:44:10.161,01:44:12.621,"Well, later, Perlmans."
01:44:12.663,01:44:15.083,"Later, later, later."
01:44:15.124,01:44:16.751,-Ciao. Ciao.
01:44:16.792,01:44:18.169,-Arrivederci.
01:44:18.211,01:44:20.379,-Arrive-ciao! Ciao.
01:44:20.421,01:44:22.131,-Ciao!
01:44:22.173,01:44:25.051,"Ciao, ciao. Ciao, ciao, ciao."
01:44:25.093,01:44:27.344,Tell Elio to call when you get there.
01:44:31.140,01:44:32.683,"-Oh, no."
01:44:48.866,01:44:51.035,Come for dinner tonight.
01:44:53.913,01:44:55.164,"Bye, darling."
01:45:03.214,01:45:04.799,-What?
01:45:04.840,01:45:06.217,-What?
01:45:43.004,01:45:44.588,Elio!
01:45:58.686,01:46:01.563,-Oliver!
01:46:27.506,01:46:28.674,Yes!
01:47:09.506,01:47:11.759,"Oh, God."
01:48:06.981,01:48:08.190,You hear that?
01:48:09.524,01:48:11.235,"Wait, wait, wait."
01:48:13.362,01:48:15.281,"No, no, no, it's this way."
01:48:15.323,01:48:17.408,Come on. Come on.
01:48:18.326,01:48:19.368,Come on.
01:48:24.957,01:48:27.001,Ja! Ragazzi!
01:48:27.042,01:48:28.794,Don't stop.
01:48:31.922,01:48:33.799,This. This.
01:48:33.841,01:48:35.426,This. You.
01:48:35.468,01:48:36.760,You are...
01:48:45.311,01:48:46.895,If you'll excuse me...
01:48:49.857,01:48:51.275,One second!
01:49:10.878,01:49:12.880,I saw them last year.
01:49:13.714,01:49:16.342,Richard Butler... Fantastic!
01:49:16.384,01:49:20.095,We saw them in concert too.
01:49:24.350,01:49:25.351,What'd she say?
01:49:37.238,01:49:39.031,"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me."
01:51:21.133,01:51:22.510,your passport?
01:51:24.470,01:51:25.762,You get your passport?
01:53:48.363,01:53:49.573,Mafalda?
01:53:50.574,01:53:51.700,Mom?
01:53:58.666,01:54:00.000,in Clusone.
01:54:01.876,01:54:03.587,"Listen, Mom, can you..."
01:54:05.213,01:54:07.174,"Can you come get me, Mom?"
01:54:53.512,01:54:54.513,Ciao.
01:54:59.768,01:55:00.935,Good.
01:55:08.861,01:55:10.654,The poems...
01:55:10.696,01:55:12.280,They're really beautiful.
01:55:12.322,01:55:15.367,I love that...
01:55:18.537,01:55:20.622,"I'm sorry, excuse me..."
01:55:20.664,01:55:22.374,that you're sad.
01:55:23.667,01:55:28.380,I'm saying that because I wanted to tell you I'm not mad at you.
01:55:38.932,01:55:40.225,"I love you, Elio."
01:55:51.152,01:55:52.446,For life.
01:57:00.430,01:57:01.640,Missed you at dinner.
01:57:25.789,01:57:27.248,So...
01:57:29.042,01:57:30.084,Welcome home.
01:57:30.585,01:57:31.586,Thanks.
01:57:33.087,01:57:35.215,-Oliver enjoyed the trip?
01:57:35.966,01:57:37.009,I think he did.
01:57:38.385,01:57:39.845,You two had a nice friendship.
01:57:42.138,01:57:43.306,Yeah.
01:57:49.688,01:57:57.111,"You're too smart not to know how rare, how special what you two had was."
01:57:59.865,01:58:01.909,Oliver was Oliver.
01:58:08.498,01:58:10.542,Because it was me.
01:58:10.584,01:58:12.586,very intelligent but...
01:58:13.503,01:58:15.088,He was more than intelligent.
01:58:17.340,01:58:23.263,What you two had had everything and nothing to do with intelligence.
01:58:23.931,01:58:25.015,It was good.
01:58:27.350,01:58:32.940,You're both lucky to have found each other because you too are good...
01:58:40.072,01:58:41.656,I think he was better than...
01:58:43.617,01:58:45.243,I think he was better than me.
01:58:48.371,01:58:50.290,I'm sure he'd say the same thing about you.
01:58:50.331,01:58:52.709,Yeah. He'd say the same thing.
01:58:53.668,01:58:54.920,It flatters you both.
01:58:58.924,01:59:05.764,"And when you least expect it, nature has cunning ways of finding our weakest spot."
01:59:08.683,01:59:12.270,"Just remember, I am here."
01:59:20.112,01:59:25.575,"Right now, you may not wanna feel anything, maybe you never wanted to feel anything."
01:59:29.412,01:59:37.545,And maybe it's not to me you'd want to speak about these things but feel something you obviously did.
01:59:41.716,01:59:43.844,"Look, you had a beautiful friendship."
01:59:45.553,01:59:47.055,Maybe more than a friendship.
01:59:48.765,01:59:50.058,And I envy you.
01:59:53.227,01:59:57.357,"In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away."
01:59:57.398,02:00:03.655,"Pray their sons land on their feet, but I am not such a parent."
02:00:06.867,02:00:13.748,"We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster, that we go bankrupt by the age of 30."
02:00:15.458,02:00:18.628,"And have less to offer, each time we start with someone new."
02:00:21.381,02:00:25.760,But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything.
02:00:27.846,02:00:28.930,What a waste.
02:00:37.022,02:00:38.356,Have I spoken out of turn?
02:00:43.195,02:00:49.743,"And I'll say one more thing, it'll clear the air."
02:00:52.746,02:00:57.417,I may have come close but I never had what you two have.
02:01:00.212,02:01:06.634,Something always held me back or stood in the way.
02:01:11.639,02:01:13.975,How you live your life is your business.
02:01:14.017,02:01:27.864,"Just remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once, and before you know it, your heart's worn out."
02:01:28.615,02:01:36.706,"And as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it much less wants to come near it."
02:01:40.210,02:01:46.507,"Right now, there's sorrow, pain."
02:01:47.050,02:01:52.722,"Don't kill it, and with it, the joy you felt."
02:02:04.818,02:02:06.194,Does Mom know?
02:02:11.992,02:02:13.534,I don't think she does.
02:03:28.235,02:03:29.569,Latkes.
02:03:30.862,02:03:32.613,-May I?
02:03:32.655,02:03:33.740,To you too.
02:03:54.427,02:03:55.887,She looks a bit weak.
02:04:03.770,02:04:06.022,She comes highly recommended by my...
02:04:07.107,02:04:11.111,Her special area of study is...
02:04:14.530,02:04:15.782,I'll get it.
02:04:19.702,02:04:20.828,Hello?
02:04:20.870,02:04:22.496,"Elio, you there?"
02:04:23.706,02:04:26.209,-Hi.
02:04:26.251,02:04:28.711,-How are you.
02:04:28.753,02:04:29.963,I'm good. How are you?
02:04:30.004,02:04:31.589,-How are your parents?
02:04:32.173,02:04:33.300,Good.
02:04:35.135,02:04:36.261,I miss you.
02:04:40.098,02:04:41.141,Very much.
02:04:45.353,02:04:48.022,-I have some news.
02:04:50.858,02:04:52.444,"What, you're getting married?"
02:04:52.944,02:04:54.112,I suppose.
02:04:56.489,02:04:59.033,"I might be getting married next spring, yeah."
02:05:02.620,02:05:04.289,You never said anything.
02:05:06.416,02:05:08.584,Been off and on for three years.
02:05:12.630,02:05:13.965,That's wonderful news.
02:05:16.176,02:05:17.302,Do you mind?
02:05:25.893,02:05:27.937,-Oliver.
02:05:27.979,02:05:29.856,when are you coming back?
02:05:31.941,02:05:35.153,in the process of choosing the new you for next summer.
02:05:35.195,02:05:37.780,-And guess what?
02:05:37.822,02:05:40.492,of calling to tell you guys I got engaged.
02:05:42.452,02:05:44.620,Wonderful!
02:05:44.662,02:05:46.580,-Congratulations.
02:05:46.622,02:05:48.749,"-Congratulations, Oliver."
02:05:48.791,02:05:52.337,Listen we'll leave you...
02:05:52.379,02:05:54.506,-Happy Hanukkah!
02:05:54.547,02:05:55.673,"Bye, sweetheart."
02:06:03.431,02:06:04.849,They know about us.
02:06:10.104,02:06:11.356,How?
02:06:12.940,02:06:16.194,your dad spoke to me.
02:06:16.236,02:06:18.738,He made me feel like I was a part of the family.
02:06:18.779,02:06:20.031,Almost like a son-in-law.
02:06:22.242,02:06:24.911,You're so lucky.
02:06:24.952,02:06:27.747,My father would have carted me off to a correctional facility.
02:06:30.291,02:06:31.543,Elio.
02:06:35.171,02:06:39.217,Elio. Elio. Elio. Elio.
02:06:47.267,02:06:48.809,I remember everything.
02:10:57.224,02:10:58.476,Elio.
