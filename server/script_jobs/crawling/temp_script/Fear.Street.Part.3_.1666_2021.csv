00:00:15.208,00:00:16.791,The first day of camp.
00:00:25.250,00:00:28.833,Only Cindy Berman would expect to clean the outhouse and not get dirty.
00:00:28.916,00:00:30.166,Tommy!
00:00:30.250,00:00:32.708,-Who are you? -Nick Goode. Nice to meet you.
00:00:33.666,00:00:35.291,"Deep down, you feel it, don't you?"
00:00:38.333,00:00:40.125,"Shadyside, there's something cursing us."
00:00:45.791,00:00:47.166,The witch is real.
00:00:49.000,00:00:50.791,And she's possessing people!
00:00:55.083,00:00:58.333,Mary… she tried to kill him.
00:01:08.500,00:01:14.000,The curse will last until body and hand unite.
00:01:14.083,00:01:15.666,We can save Shadyside.
00:01:15.750,00:01:19.000,We have to bury this thing… right fucking now.
00:01:24.791,00:01:26.791,-Where is she? The body? -I don't know.
00:01:38.625,00:01:41.416,"We know where the body is, so all we need is the hand."
00:01:41.500,00:01:43.416,Is it still buried under the Hanging Tree?
00:01:57.208,00:01:58.458,Sarah Fier!
00:02:31.708,00:02:32.791,Sarah!
00:02:40.000,00:02:42.125,There's one more. It's breeched.
00:02:46.416,00:02:47.416,Hold her still.
00:02:49.708,00:02:52.250,I feel it. It's fighting to get out.
00:02:53.250,00:02:54.625,Tough little bastard.
00:02:55.791,00:02:56.750,I said hold her!
00:02:56.833,00:02:57.958,Sorry!
00:02:59.166,00:03:01.666,We're going to lose her. We're going to lose both.
00:03:01.750,00:03:02.583,"No, we aren't."
00:03:04.208,00:03:05.791,"Don't go wobbly on me now, Henry."
00:03:05.875,00:03:07.916,"-On three, all right? -All right."
00:03:08.500,00:03:13.833,One… two… three.
00:03:27.666,00:03:28.916,"You have a gift, Sarah."
00:03:29.000,00:03:30.541,It's luck is all.
00:03:30.625,00:03:32.958,Luck and a very sharp knife.
00:03:33.041,00:03:34.750,This wicked one is going to Solomon.
00:03:35.875,00:03:40.791,-He's lucky to have a friend like you. -Father… What? He's struggled so.
00:03:41.666,00:03:45.750,"First his child, then his wife. He needs someone to take care of him."
00:03:46.250,00:03:48.333,Someone strong and capable.
00:03:48.416,00:03:52.041,"I'm not marrying Solomon bloody Goode, if that's what you're driving at."
00:03:52.125,00:03:55.875,I worry about you. Is it so wrong for a father to wish his daughter to wed?
00:03:55.958,00:03:58.708,And leave you alone to eat up all the bacon?
00:03:58.791,00:03:59.708,Not likely.
00:04:28.458,00:04:30.291,A full moon rises before nightfall.
00:04:30.375,00:04:32.333,Good night to enjoy the fruits of the land.
00:04:45.916,00:04:47.791,A full moon rises before nightfall.
00:04:48.916,00:04:51.166,A good night to enjoy the fruits of the land.
00:04:51.250,00:04:53.791,Try to clean yourself up before then.
00:05:07.125,00:05:11.208,"Oh, but I see you. I've got eyes in the back of my head!"
00:05:14.250,00:05:17.333,"-Don't be a brat, Constance! -Don't be a shrew, Abigail!"
00:05:18.208,00:05:19.208,Sarah!
00:05:21.541,00:05:23.625,A full moon rises before nightfall.
00:05:23.708,00:05:25.583,Good night to enjoy fruits of the land.
00:05:25.666,00:05:26.791,I'm coming too!
00:05:26.875,00:05:27.875,"No, you're not."
00:05:27.958,00:05:29.208,Then I'm telling Mother.
00:05:29.291,00:05:31.958,You tell Mother and I'll cut your braids off your head.
00:05:32.041,00:05:35.708,Don't be getting us into trouble. You know what Mother will do.
00:05:38.791,00:05:40.916,A full moon rises before nightfall.
00:05:41.500,00:05:45.125,Holy Hannah Miller? Don't tell me you're going.
00:05:45.208,00:05:47.000,"Oh, I'm going."
00:05:47.083,00:05:51.083,"In fact, I'm going with Lizzie before to get berries from the widow."
00:05:51.166,00:05:52.000,What?
00:05:52.083,00:05:55.541,"Hannah, it's one thing for Lizzie to trade with that hag."
00:05:55.625,00:05:58.916,It's another for the pastor's daughter.
00:05:59.875,00:06:01.833,Aren't you even a little curious?
00:06:05.083,00:06:06.833,I'll only go if you go.
00:06:08.333,00:06:09.500,Please?
00:06:10.916,00:06:14.708,"Girl, what's taking so long? I need help with… Get inside."
00:06:32.291,00:06:34.708,"I can see a secret about you, girl."
00:06:34.791,00:06:36.666,"And a good day to you, Thomas."
00:06:36.750,00:06:40.125,"Don't you want to hear it, pretty girl?"
00:06:41.375,00:06:42.375,Good girl.
00:06:43.875,00:06:45.458,I can see everything.
00:06:46.583,00:06:48.791,I see all the dark secrets in Union.
00:06:50.625,00:06:51.833,You must be busy.
00:06:53.916,00:06:56.583,"I see the darkness in you, girl!"
00:06:56.666,00:06:58.125,"Be still, Thomas!"
00:07:00.958,00:07:02.750,"Beware, Sarah Fier."
00:07:24.708,00:07:25.708,Sarah.
00:07:33.625,00:07:35.750,It's too much. I can't accept it.
00:07:38.291,00:07:40.750,We're practically married. Haven't you heard?
00:07:40.833,00:07:44.500,"Well, in that case, tell your father this isn't nearly worth it."
00:07:49.125,00:07:52.000,Shadows fall on us all now and then.
00:07:53.250,00:07:58.041,"My, uh… My brother wants me to give up."
00:07:59.791,00:08:01.416,Move back to the settlement.
00:08:02.416,00:08:04.833,He says the Goode family are not farmers.
00:08:07.291,00:08:10.500,"But these lands, they are fertile. I know it."
00:08:11.291,00:08:12.791,We'll have a healthy crop yet.
00:08:13.375,00:08:14.708,The sun will shine on us.
00:08:16.208,00:08:17.708,You look like death.
00:08:19.125,00:08:21.375,"Sarah Fier, flattering as ever."
00:08:23.666,00:08:25.458,"Well, I'm going to lose light."
00:08:25.958,00:08:26.875,I should go.
00:08:27.916,00:08:30.000,Full moon rises before nightfall.
00:08:32.416,00:08:35.083,Nothing good comes from those woods after sundown.
00:08:35.166,00:08:36.833,You sound like my father.
00:08:37.541,00:08:38.500,So you're going?
00:08:39.291,00:08:40.291,Going where?
00:09:00.583,00:09:02.125,Shouldn't you be sleeping?
00:09:02.958,00:09:05.875,Shouldn't you be sleeping? Father wouldn't approve.
00:09:05.958,00:09:07.166,Then don't tell him.
00:09:17.875,00:09:19.666,"The widow's 1,000 years old."
00:09:19.750,00:09:22.125,She drinks the blood of virgins to keep her youth.
00:09:25.375,00:09:28.041,She sacrificed her husband to become the Devil's bride.
00:09:28.125,00:09:29.708,That's how she gained eternal life.
00:09:29.791,00:09:34.916,"Well, I heard she kept the company of the natives, and that she even fell in love with one."
00:09:35.000,00:09:36.750,That's why she was exiled.
00:09:36.833,00:09:39.416,She learned their medicine too. Solomon told me.
00:09:40.333,00:09:45.250,"He took his wife to her after they lost their child, but it was too late."
00:09:47.750,00:09:51.541,Are you sure this is the right way? How do you know where we're going?
00:09:52.583,00:09:56.583,I've been there before. Remember when Abigail had her ring of fire?
00:09:57.583,00:10:00.291,She was scratching like a dog during Father's sermon.
00:10:00.375,00:10:02.750,Mother told me she'd lain with a demon.
00:10:02.833,00:10:04.458,The Devil's gift.
00:10:04.541,00:10:06.791,More like Mad Thomas's gift.
00:10:06.875,00:10:09.875,"Well, whoever she lay with, Abbi made me go to the widow with her."
00:10:09.958,00:10:12.916,"-And the widow fixed her with witchcraft? -Yes, witchcraft."
00:10:13.666,00:10:17.000,And some foul-smelling paste made for whores like Abbi Berman.
00:10:28.458,00:10:29.916,Are we sure about this?
00:10:55.541,00:10:56.541,Widow Mary?
00:11:03.375,00:11:04.291,Widow Mary?
00:11:10.000,00:11:11.041,She's not here.
00:11:12.125,00:11:13.125,Find the berries.
00:12:14.916,00:12:22.166,Abbadon… Azazel… Beelzebub… Moloch.
00:12:25.875,00:12:26.875,Satan.
00:12:32.958,00:12:36.083,The veil has grown thin with the turn of the moon.
00:12:36.708,00:12:39.875,"And with it, the Morning Star rises."
00:12:40.375,00:12:43.625,Beware the Devil. He lives in that book.
00:12:43.708,00:12:45.125,He calls to you from it.
00:12:48.458,00:12:49.708,He senses you now.
00:12:49.791,00:12:59.500,"And if you're not careful, he'll bore himself beneath your skin and he'll consume you from the inside out."
00:13:01.166,00:13:02.000,Sarah?
00:13:02.583,00:13:03.750,Get out.
00:13:04.625,00:13:05.625,Get out.
00:13:06.125,00:13:07.500,Get out!
00:13:27.291,00:13:28.666,Full moon rises.
00:13:48.166,00:13:49.416,To the fruits of the land.
00:14:21.375,00:14:23.375,Entertain yourself with someone else.
00:14:27.750,00:14:29.625,"Don't tease me, girl."
00:14:34.791,00:14:37.166,"Sarah Fier, you want a kiss too?"
00:14:37.250,00:14:50.416,"You know, maybe if you weren't such a frigid bitch-- And if you're still so eager, I'm sure there's a mule tied up who will overlook your flaws in the dark."
00:15:06.041,00:15:07.958,I'm just not afraid with you.
00:15:18.041,00:15:19.625,We should go back.
00:15:24.125,00:15:25.000,Should we?
00:15:42.500,00:15:43.916,This is wrong.
00:15:45.916,00:15:47.166,Doesn't feel wrong.
00:15:56.875,00:15:58.708,Tell me to stop and I shall.
00:16:49.750,00:16:50.958,Someone saw us.
00:16:51.041,00:16:52.416,They couldn't.
00:16:52.500,00:16:54.500,What if it was the widow or Caleb?
00:16:54.583,00:16:56.916,Caleb can barely find his own member.
00:16:57.666,00:17:01.750,"But if he saw us, if he tells-- That spoiled piglet doesn't scare me."
00:17:01.833,00:17:03.958,"They'll hang us, Sarah."
00:17:05.375,00:17:07.041,"Well, let them hang us then."
00:17:08.291,00:17:11.583,I was not alive before now anyway.
00:17:19.916,00:17:22.083,"Sinners, sinners."
00:18:06.375,00:18:07.833,"Get in, you brute."
00:18:21.041,00:18:23.666,You've overslept. I've done most of the morning work.
00:18:27.875,00:18:28.958,I'm coming.
00:18:48.041,00:18:49.958,"Merryboy, time to eat!"
00:18:54.166,00:18:55.541,"Oh, where are you, dog?"
00:18:59.250,00:19:00.333,Merryboy?
00:19:19.916,00:19:21.041,You scared me.
00:19:22.958,00:19:24.791,There's something wrong with my father.
00:19:29.791,00:19:31.791,"To be freed, to be released."
00:19:31.875,00:19:33.125,What is he saying?
00:19:34.541,00:19:35.375,I don't know.
00:19:48.291,00:19:52.208,"He's distracted, listening to things only he can hear."
00:19:52.791,00:19:54.041,Perhaps it is prayer?
00:19:56.666,00:20:01.708,"No, something is… wrong."
00:20:02.916,00:20:12.708,I look in his eyes and it's as if… As if something crawled in from the night and put on Father's skin.
00:20:13.916,00:20:23.083,"It looks like him, but… Mother's gone to the meeting house."
00:20:23.583,00:20:33.833,"She says we must ask God, but I don't know which Psalm, what passage-- He needs proper medicine, Hannah."
00:20:34.750,00:20:37.083,-I will talk to your mother. -No!
00:20:37.958,00:20:39.666,She can't know you were here.
00:20:42.416,00:20:44.541,I'm not to see you anymore.
00:20:47.958,00:20:49.125,Not to see me?
00:20:50.000,00:20:51.583,"She suspects us, Sarah."
00:20:55.125,00:21:00.750,She suspects our… wickedness.
00:21:01.458,00:21:03.291,And now Father is sick.
00:21:04.000,00:21:09.375,Do you think… Did we cause it?
00:21:15.500,00:21:17.416,Everything will be all right.
00:21:23.291,00:21:25.625,You! You!
00:21:25.708,00:21:28.416,"You won't stop until you've completely ruined her life, will you?"
00:21:28.500,00:21:30.625,-Mother! -You shut your mouth!
00:21:30.708,00:21:33.333,Thomas saw you last night in town!
00:21:33.416,00:21:37.583,He's telling everyone! How dare you bring this filth into our home!
00:21:38.166,00:21:40.333,"I see what you really are, girl."
00:21:40.416,00:21:43.000,An abomination corrupting my daughter.
00:21:43.083,00:21:44.833,Born of perversion!
00:21:44.916,00:21:46.583,"Goody Miller, please!"
00:21:50.791,00:21:52.875,"God knows what you are, girl!"
00:21:52.958,00:21:56.125,You'd better pray for mercy on your damned soul!
00:22:29.791,00:22:30.708,No.
00:22:30.791,00:22:33.000,I heard you come home late last night.
00:22:36.125,00:22:38.375,"You were out with the pastor's daughter, weren't you?"
00:22:39.041,00:22:40.250,And Abbi.
00:22:41.333,00:22:44.708,And Lizzie and… the others.
00:22:52.833,00:22:56.208,"You know, it was your mother who convinced us to settle this land."
00:22:58.166,00:23:01.583,She was wise enough to understand this land was special.
00:23:02.708,00:23:04.958,She said she could feel it in the air.
00:23:06.541,00:23:07.541,The lake.
00:23:09.500,00:23:10.375,The woods.
00:23:11.458,00:23:17.416,So we put down roots… and made up our own Eden here.
00:23:18.666,00:23:20.041,She was a good woman.
00:23:22.208,00:23:27.250,And I fear in her absence… I have failed her.
00:23:29.125,00:23:30.458,I have failed you both.
00:23:31.500,00:23:38.166,"Father… There has always been a strangeness in you, Sarah."
00:23:38.250,00:23:45.416,"A streak… Something perhaps a mother could have rooted out, but you were raised like a boy."
00:23:45.916,00:23:49.708,"I gave you too much freedom, and now it is too late."
00:23:51.875,00:23:53.291,It's my fault.
00:24:43.916,00:24:44.916,She ate them.
00:24:48.458,00:24:49.541,She ate them all.
00:24:53.958,00:24:55.416,"Bring me the ax, Henry."
00:24:55.500,00:24:57.500,Sarah… The ax!
00:25:34.666,00:25:37.833,to harvest the bitter fruit of the evil we have sown.
00:25:39.750,00:25:41.500,To feast on our misdeeds.
00:25:47.625,00:25:50.000,blind to the horrors around us.
00:25:51.500,00:25:53.750,"But you see it now, don't you?"
00:25:55.041,00:25:58.583,"He blocks our well, clogs it with our sin."
00:26:00.750,00:26:03.000,He takes our water. He takes our life blood!
00:26:04.541,00:26:07.250,-What's going on here? -The bucket's caught on something.
00:26:14.458,00:26:15.500,It's coming!
00:26:16.083,00:26:17.083,It rises!
00:26:21.875,00:26:23.333,A dead dog in the well!
00:26:33.833,00:26:37.375,This is the work of the Devil. He has come to stake our land.
00:26:38.708,00:26:41.041,Who among you has welcomed the Devil to Union?
00:26:43.000,00:26:44.000,Whose lust?
00:26:44.500,00:26:45.500,Whose sin?
00:26:46.666,00:26:48.333,"Oh, foolish Union."
00:26:49.500,00:26:53.958,The Devil has come and cast his darkness over us.
00:26:55.916,00:27:02.041,And his darkness grows within each of us like a rot.
00:27:20.833,00:27:25.916,Solomon… I didn't mean to stop by unexpected.
00:27:26.000,00:27:31.875,"I have just a, uh… a small thank you."
00:27:36.916,00:27:37.916,It's for Sarah.
00:27:41.958,00:27:42.958,What is it?
00:27:43.958,00:27:45.250,Can you keep a secret?
00:27:46.333,00:27:49.250,And that's when I saw something in the trees.
00:27:49.333,00:27:50.708,A figure.
00:27:52.000,00:27:52.958,Who was it?
00:27:53.041,00:27:54.708,I don't know. It was so dark.
00:27:55.416,00:27:59.083,I thought it was Caleb or… or the widow.
00:28:00.083,00:28:02.500,But now… What?
00:28:09.375,00:28:20.625,"Now we are tormented and the pastor is sick and… and I feel half mad, and now I wonder if perhaps something is wrong with me."
00:28:20.708,00:28:23.208,"-Sarah-- -And always has been, Solomon."
00:28:24.125,00:28:26.625,I was never normal. My own father said so.
00:28:28.416,00:28:32.958,Maybe I was born wicked and strange.
00:28:34.166,00:28:36.791,Maybe it was the Devil in the woods.
00:28:38.666,00:28:40.375,Maybe the Devil is in me.
00:28:40.458,00:28:42.416,Stop! You sound like Mad Thomas.
00:28:42.500,00:28:44.000,Perhaps Thomas is right.
00:28:44.083,00:28:46.583,"Thomas is a mindless drunk, nothing more."
00:28:46.666,00:28:49.916,"Look around, Solomon. There is blight everywhere."
00:28:50.000,00:28:57.833,"I… I… I grant you that, but you… Hannah was just a dalliance, Sarah."
00:28:59.250,00:29:00.625,And if it wasn't?
00:29:05.041,00:29:06.125,What do you mean?
00:29:09.791,00:29:11.500,That's why I'm so afraid.
00:29:13.791,00:29:14.916,Do you understand?
00:29:31.708,00:29:32.750,I see.
00:29:41.291,00:29:55.916,Listen to me… Dalliance or not… one does not summon the Devil by chance.
00:29:56.000,00:30:01.875,"Even the weakest heart, the most corruptible soul, they must make the choice."
00:30:01.958,00:30:06.541,"They must extend their hand, which you did not do."
00:30:08.208,00:30:09.500,-No. -No.
00:30:14.875,00:30:17.125,"You can always come to me, Sarah."
00:30:17.708,00:30:19.625,My door is always open to you.
00:30:28.791,00:30:30.875,Constance! Where is Constance?
00:30:35.500,00:30:37.291,-Brother! What's happening? -The pastor.
00:30:37.375,00:30:40.375,He's locked the children in the Meeting House. A dozen at least.
00:30:40.458,00:30:41.958,Henry! Where is Henry?
00:30:47.916,00:30:48.916,Solomon!
00:30:53.708,00:30:54.625,Cyrus!
00:31:17.625,00:31:19.083,Keep everyone back.
00:31:20.125,00:31:21.458,"Solomon, wait!"
00:31:26.416,00:31:28.083,Let me in! No!
00:31:37.708,00:31:40.041,Resigned to deficit.
00:31:41.958,00:31:43.750,What's happening in there?
00:31:43.833,00:31:47.708,-Let me go! Let me go! Cyrus! -Constance!
00:32:24.375,00:32:25.958,I can see everything.
00:32:41.958,00:32:43.125,Our children!
00:32:58.166,00:32:59.375,Henry!
00:33:05.791,00:33:06.833,"Cyrus, no!"
00:33:11.458,00:33:12.375,No!
00:33:15.250,00:33:17.541,Witchcraft! Witchcraft!
00:33:18.250,00:33:20.333,Evil! Show yourself!
00:33:44.000,00:33:45.916,"Good people of Union, listen!"
00:33:48.500,00:33:50.666,and evil force at work here.
00:33:50.750,00:33:53.208,If we are ever to end this misery… Aye!
00:33:53.291,00:33:55.833,…then we must root out the guilty.
00:33:58.000,00:34:00.916,The man responsible is dead.
00:34:03.500,00:34:05.958,Our pastor was a man of God.
00:34:11.541,00:34:18.166,"My child, my dear Constance, and many others… are dead."
00:34:20.916,00:34:24.541,…many of our entire bloodlines have been stolen from us.
00:34:25.416,00:34:27.166,Someone must pay!
00:34:31.375,00:34:39.416,"I saw some little lambs of our town… laughing, dallying on the full moon last!"
00:34:41.625,00:34:49.083,"There were some of us in the woods, but there was no… We drank Apple Jack. We danced."
00:34:49.583,00:34:52.166,We are young. That is not a crime!
00:34:52.666,00:34:53.583,Heathens!
00:34:53.666,00:34:56.208,You have sinned! You have sinned!
00:34:57.208,00:34:58.750,Look upon your children!
00:34:59.875,00:35:02.000,For they will bear the Devil's mark!
00:35:10.791,00:35:22.666,"But just as my brother Solomon heroically expelled the darkness among us by killing our afflicted pastor, we too will punish and surmount this evil!"
00:35:22.750,00:35:24.041,"Yes, we will!"
00:35:24.125,00:35:29.541,"As survivors, our faces always will remain toward the sun."
00:35:40.958,00:35:45.666,This scourge centers on Union proper.
00:35:46.666,00:35:49.916,I've searched the woods. It does not extend beyond the settlement.
00:35:55.041,00:35:59.750,"We are being punished, and I have a list of names!"
00:35:59.833,00:36:02.708,"Oh, then show it to us! Show it to us!"
00:36:02.791,00:36:05.500,Enough! Enough!
00:36:05.583,00:36:07.458,Listen to yourselves!
00:36:08.541,00:36:09.875,Speculation!
00:36:11.333,00:36:13.375,Chasing shadows!
00:36:13.458,00:36:15.166,Imagined curses!
00:36:16.916,00:36:19.833,I ask… do you have proof?
00:36:21.000,00:36:22.625,No. Or you?
00:36:25.375,00:36:27.083,Or any of you?
00:36:29.500,00:36:30.666,I have proof!
00:36:34.208,00:36:39.791,It was some nights back when the full moon had risen just beside the sun.
00:36:39.875,00:36:43.833,"As I lay sleeping, she came to me."
00:36:45.958,00:36:49.291,She witched me and led me to the woods.
00:36:51.500,00:36:56.125,She was naked… …and riding a red mule.
00:36:56.208,00:36:57.208,Yes.
00:37:01.750,00:37:05.250,And she made me watch as she lay with the Devil.
00:37:06.333,00:37:09.833,As both of them lay with the Devil.
00:37:10.708,00:37:11.750,Both of them?
00:37:15.708,00:37:17.541,-No! -No!
00:37:17.625,00:37:19.458,Witches! Witches!
00:37:19.541,00:37:20.916,-Witches! -Witches!
00:37:22.375,00:37:25.083,Witches! Witches!
00:37:25.166,00:37:27.625,I saw Hannah Miller and Sarah Fier.
00:37:27.708,00:37:29.333,I saw Hannah Miller.
00:37:29.416,00:37:30.625,I saw Hannah Miller.
00:37:30.708,00:37:31.791,I saw Hannah Miller.
00:37:31.875,00:37:33.208,I saw Sarah Fier.
00:37:33.291,00:37:35.666,-I saw Sarah Fier. -I saw Sarah Fier.
00:37:42.958,00:37:44.916,Witches! The witches!
00:37:45.000,00:37:45.958,The witches!
00:38:02.166,00:38:04.458,-We need to get away from here! -And go where?
00:38:08.000,00:38:09.625,Go! Go!
00:38:12.750,00:38:13.916,disgusting whore!
00:38:15.000,00:38:17.750,Silence! Check her for marks!
00:38:19.958,00:38:21.708,No! No!
00:38:26.208,00:38:27.666,No! No!
00:38:27.750,00:38:29.125,"Be still, witch!"
00:38:41.208,00:38:44.708,of this… …wretched pollution!
00:38:49.750,00:38:51.291,every inch of wood!
00:38:52.250,00:38:55.583,We will not rest and we will not have mercy!
00:39:04.333,00:39:05.541,Yeah!
00:39:06.125,00:39:08.333,We will find Sarah Fier!
00:39:47.333,00:40:21.958,-Father! -My fault… Did you hear that? The other side of the house.
00:40:57.250,00:40:59.791,Take your musket round back to the Fier house.
00:40:59.875,00:41:01.583,Keep an eye on George Fier.
00:41:02.166,00:41:04.125,Keep an eye out for that witch.
00:42:00.375,00:42:01.625,Hannah?
00:42:09.750,00:42:12.500,I am to hang on the morrow.
00:42:13.875,00:42:16.458,"And if you don't flee, you will too."
00:42:19.500,00:42:21.208,You need to run.
00:42:22.333,00:42:24.750,"-No, I won't leave you. -You must!"
00:42:30.583,00:42:32.500,This is my fault anyway.
00:42:33.625,00:42:35.750,-No. -I led the Devil here.
00:42:35.833,00:42:40.208,That is not how it works. You do not summon the Devil by chance.
00:42:41.375,00:42:43.208,You have to make a choice.
00:42:43.291,00:42:44.750,Don't you see?
00:42:45.583,00:42:48.250,It doesn't matter if we did it or not.
00:42:48.750,00:42:51.291,"They think we're guilty, so we are."
00:42:53.916,00:42:54.916,You're right.
00:42:58.833,00:43:00.750,Everyone believes we've done it.
00:43:01.791,00:43:04.000,So what difference does it make if we do now?
00:43:05.416,00:43:08.250,-What are you saying? -I will go back to the widow.
00:43:12.625,00:43:15.625,I will make a deal with the Devil.
00:43:19.375,00:43:20.791,Perhaps that can save us.
00:43:20.875,00:43:24.041,But the Devil… Are you mad?
00:43:24.125,00:43:25.583,I don't fear the Devil.
00:43:26.333,00:43:31.250,"Hannah, I fear the neighbor who would accuse me."
00:43:32.291,00:43:36.166,I fear the mother that would let her daughter hang.
00:43:37.250,00:43:38.750,I fear Union.
00:43:39.708,00:43:43.791,They lead us like lambs to the slaughter and expect us to just follow.
00:43:45.500,00:43:50.500,"Well, they will see… I am no lamb."
00:43:54.833,00:43:58.916,"When this is over, we will leave this place."
00:43:59.583,00:44:06.208,"We will go far away and we'll dance every night, then kiss in the broad daylight."
00:44:14.458,00:44:16.083,I can't lose you.
00:44:20.250,00:44:26.291,If they want a witch… I will give them a witch.
00:45:05.125,00:45:06.125,Mary!
00:46:08.166,00:46:09.541,"Away, Elijah."
00:46:16.083,00:46:18.500,"-Elijah, I said enough! -Please, you have to help me!"
00:46:20.541,00:46:25.208,"-We're innocent, Solomon. -I know… Hannah and I, we didn't do this!"
00:46:25.291,00:46:27.833,-You're bleeding. -It doesn't matter. Listen to me.
00:46:27.916,00:46:30.583,"I went back to the woods, to the widow."
00:46:30.666,00:46:34.083,"-Sarah! -She's dead, Solomon! Someone killed her!"
00:46:34.166,00:46:41.250,"And there was this… this book… with a… a kind of instruction, an incantation."
00:46:41.750,00:46:44.458,-An incantation? For what? -Yeah.
00:46:47.083,00:46:50.125,I think someone struck a deal with the Devil.
00:46:51.541,00:46:52.833,Offering our town.
00:46:56.125,00:46:58.791,"In exchange, perhaps, for power?"
00:47:00.583,00:47:05.333,"Solomon, I swear it… it wasn't me!"
00:47:08.041,00:47:16.625,Sarah… I believe you.
00:47:24.250,00:47:25.583,Who else knows about this?
00:47:25.666,00:47:26.833,No one.
00:47:49.041,00:47:50.208,"Open up, Solomon!"
00:47:55.583,00:47:57.250,We're looking for Sarah Fier.
00:47:58.125,00:47:59.583,There's no one here but me.
00:47:59.666,00:48:01.208,Then we're free to search.
00:48:04.250,00:48:07.166,"Do not try to intimidate me, Caleb. I am not some child!"
00:48:15.833,00:48:17.583,"What's in the back room, Solomon?"
00:48:40.416,00:48:41.541,let me check.
00:48:42.666,00:48:44.000,What do you have to hide?
00:48:46.500,00:48:50.541,"I'll tell you once more. There's no one here, but me."
00:49:05.750,00:49:06.875,Come on!
00:49:13.708,00:49:15.000,"All of you, go on!"
00:50:28.416,00:50:46.416,Ahriman… Azazel… Bael… You!
00:50:47.541,00:50:48.750,It's you!
00:50:58.583,00:51:23.875,Samael… Lucifer… Gorgon… Morning Star… It's you.
00:51:23.958,00:51:25.375,I'm still me.
00:51:26.666,00:51:28.083,I've always been me.
00:51:28.708,00:51:33.166,Only I've grown tired of watching fortune turn a blind eye to me.
00:51:33.250,00:51:34.916,How could you?
00:51:35.000,00:51:38.166,How could I what? Take what we all want?
00:51:38.250,00:51:40.791,What we all came here for?
00:51:40.875,00:51:43.791,"Power, prosperity, legacy."
00:51:43.875,00:51:50.666,"Consider, Sarah… a single soul… Cyrus Miller."
00:51:54.916,00:51:56.083,Just one.
00:51:56.583,00:51:57.750,Pastor Miller.
00:52:00.250,00:52:03.125,what no amount of praying could ever bring.
00:52:03.208,00:52:07.833,One person every few years seems a small price to pay.
00:52:08.333,00:52:10.125,One person?
00:52:11.416,00:52:13.666,The pastor slew 12 children!
00:52:18.583,00:52:20.000,Who's innocent?
00:52:22.625,00:52:28.875,"Your neighbors hunt you, forsake you, curse your name!"
00:52:28.958,00:52:30.541,Everywhere is ignorance!
00:52:31.166,00:52:32.250,Dread!
00:52:32.333,00:52:34.958,Yet you resign yourself to it!
00:52:40.208,00:52:44.000,They're afraid because they know you're different.
00:52:47.125,00:52:48.375,And you are.
00:52:51.125,00:52:58.041,"Someone who refuses to settle for the rules of these dogmatists, who seeks more from the world."
00:53:03.333,00:53:04.541,You're like me.
00:53:08.750,00:53:10.625,I am nothing like you!
00:53:34.375,00:53:35.541,Sarah!
00:53:44.250,00:53:45.250,Sarah!
00:53:49.875,00:53:51.000,Sarah!
00:54:02.916,00:54:03.916,Sarah?
00:54:06.583,00:54:07.666,Sarah!
00:54:10.083,00:54:12.375,"Sarah, come back to me!"
00:54:25.208,00:54:26.625,Sarah!
00:54:30.250,00:54:31.375,Sarah!
00:55:46.958,00:55:48.333,No!
00:55:48.416,00:55:51.125,"No! No, no, no, no!"
00:55:56.625,00:56:00.041,"Please, do not make me hurt you! I love you, Sarah! I love you!"
00:56:00.125,00:56:06.583,Stop fighting! I don't want to hurt-- No!
00:56:11.375,00:56:13.500,No! No!
00:56:14.416,00:56:15.625,No!
00:59:09.125,00:59:10.875,I found the witch!
00:59:15.916,00:59:17.750,"No, no!"
00:59:58.916,01:00:00.375,is death by hanging!
01:00:02.708,01:00:04.166,Hang them!
01:00:06.416,01:00:07.625,Confess!
01:00:09.375,01:00:12.375,Confess your sins or burn in eternal hell.
01:00:17.583,01:00:18.666,Confess!
01:00:20.833,01:00:21.750,Confess!
01:00:43.875,01:00:45.625,No! No!
01:00:45.708,01:00:47.375,I confess!
01:00:48.041,01:00:51.416,-No! She's lying! -I walked with the Devil!
01:00:53.041,01:00:54.500,I lay with him!
01:00:55.541,01:00:57.583,I bewitched the good pastor.
01:00:58.666,01:01:02.458,And I bewitched… Hannah Miller.
01:01:05.916,01:01:07.458,I clouded her mind.
01:01:12.583,01:01:13.750,It was me.
01:01:21.416,01:01:22.708,It was only me.
01:01:26.875,01:01:28.250,It was always me.
01:01:55.000,01:01:58.208,The truth will come out.
01:01:59.250,01:02:05.791,"Maybe not today… and maybe not tomorrow, but it will."
01:02:06.458,01:02:09.875,The truth shall be your curse.
01:02:11.375,01:02:13.916,It will follow you for eternity.
01:02:14.916,01:02:17.750,I will shadow you forever.
01:02:19.208,01:02:21.208,I will show them what you've done.
01:02:22.000,01:02:26.791,I will never… let you go.
01:02:30.958,01:02:33.166,-Hang her! -Hang her!
01:02:33.250,01:02:34.166,Witch!
01:02:34.250,01:02:35.375,Hang the witch!
01:03:06.250,01:03:07.833,The truth will come out.
01:03:09.375,01:03:10.458,Maybe not today.
01:03:11.625,01:03:15.625,"Maybe not tomorrow, but it will."
01:03:18.791,01:03:21.208,alone underneath this tree.
01:03:30.041,01:03:32.333,So no one else knows where she is.
01:03:56.875,01:04:00.208,The truth shall be your curse.
01:04:18.250,01:04:26.416,"And everything you take and everyone you harm, you will feel the grip of my hand."
01:04:29.000,01:04:32.041,I will show them what you've done.
01:04:42.291,01:04:45.666,I will never let you go.
01:06:37.916,01:06:38.916,You OK?
01:06:42.666,01:06:43.500,Need help?
01:06:43.583,01:06:47.541,"Uh… Uh, no, sir. I'm good over here."
01:06:50.291,01:06:51.666,What brings you back here?
01:06:54.250,01:06:55.250,Where's your sister?
01:06:57.166,01:06:59.791,Officer… Huh?
01:07:18.041,01:07:18.958,It's him!
01:07:23.833,01:07:25.916,Your sister is very confused.
01:07:28.958,01:07:29.958,What?
01:07:33.708,01:07:34.833,a breakdown.
01:07:37.541,01:07:38.958,She needs help.
01:07:39.541,01:07:40.750,Josh?
01:07:41.875,01:07:43.750,Goode is evil!
01:08:22.875,01:08:26.625,"I was back in time. I was Sarah Fier, and Sarah Fier was innocent."
01:08:26.708,01:08:30.291,She isn't turning people in Shadyside into killers. She wasn't a witch!
01:08:34.875,01:08:38.250,-Suspects on their way. -Josh! Listen! Solomon Goode-- Who?
01:08:38.333,01:08:43.500,"Nick Goode's Pilgrim ancestor made a deal with the Devil, then framed Sarah to cover his own Puritan ass."
01:08:43.583,01:08:44.625,Deena!
01:08:48.041,01:08:51.958,"The Goodes, they're trading us. People from Shadyside."
01:09:08.208,01:09:09.208,What?
01:09:09.291,01:09:12.333,Then that person kills and murders.
01:09:29.291,01:09:30.916,And Goode gets whatever he wants.
01:09:31.583,01:09:32.916,He becomes Sheriff.
01:09:34.125,01:09:35.791,His brother becomes mayor.
01:09:36.291,01:09:38.708,All of Sunnyvale gets better and better.
01:09:42.541,01:09:44.166,And Shadyside doesn't.
01:09:46.291,01:09:49.666,"And the Goodes do it over and over, again and again."
01:09:49.750,01:09:53.458,One Goode from every generation passing down the evil.
01:10:03.666,01:10:05.000,William Barker.
01:10:08.291,01:10:09.291,Ruby Lane.
01:10:16.958,01:10:18.916,"-So, Sarah Fier-- -He framed her!"
01:10:19.916,01:10:24.916,She's the only one who's ever figured out the truth… until us.
01:10:25.000,01:10:28.125,And the killers came after us to keep us from uncovering it.
01:10:28.208,01:10:30.875,"Yes, to protect Goode's deal with the Devil."
01:10:31.375,01:10:34.000,"But… but, Deena?"
01:10:34.500,01:10:35.625,"Yeah, Josh?"
01:10:41.083,01:10:47.166,"now that we know the truth, now we know about Goode's deal… …what happens now?"
01:11:21.375,01:11:22.916,"Oh, Jesus Christ!"
01:11:23.000,01:11:27.000,Look at her! I told you it wouldn't work! There's no ending it.
01:11:31.333,01:11:32.583,What is it?
01:11:34.333,01:11:35.458,We need to talk.
01:11:39.083,01:11:42.166,for rescuing poor helpless Shadysider me!
01:11:46.541,01:11:47.958,-Now. -Now.
01:12:02.166,01:12:04.166,What if that's not who I want to be?
01:12:04.250,01:12:06.583,"You believe me, right? About the curse?"
01:12:07.166,01:12:08.083,"Yeah, of course."
01:12:09.166,01:12:14.291,"I've let a lot of people die… -Nick, this isn't your fault. -But not you. I'm not letting you die."
01:12:22.250,01:12:23.833,it's real.
01:12:27.083,01:12:28.416,we have to kill him.
01:12:30.708,01:12:32.166,We need to kill Nick Goode.
01:12:34.916,01:12:40.833,But I called him… I thought… I thought he could help.
01:12:41.875,01:12:43.750,We need to go. Now!
01:12:58.791,01:13:00.750,I wanted to do that all day.
01:13:03.583,01:13:06.458,-Should be up here on the right. -Are we sure about this?
01:13:19.375,01:13:22.791,"You gotta be kidding me. Yo, man, I wasn't doing nothing."
01:13:23.291,01:13:24.833,Minding my business.
01:13:29.833,01:13:34.416,Uh… Wanna help us kill Sheriff Goode?
01:13:36.541,01:13:38.041,Let me get my coat.
01:13:42.000,01:13:46.208,I ensure that all retail establishments come equipped with the StoreSafe 250.
01:13:47.000,01:13:48.708,This is the Cadillac of store gates.
01:13:48.791,01:14:02.375,"Now, the 250 prevents your standard smash-and-grab, graffiti, all while complying with the 70% visibility ordinance. Best part… Easy to operate."
01:14:02.458,01:14:04.625,And we can rig them for quick release?
01:14:04.708,01:14:08.208,"Little grease, these things go down faster than a Sunnyvale cheerleader."
01:14:10.416,01:14:13.708,so the killers will go after Deena's blood just like they did with Sam.
01:14:13.791,01:14:22.708,"And then we use that to lure them into the stores, and then… Welcome to the clink, motherfucker."
01:14:22.791,01:14:25.416,"The killers will be locked up, then it's us versus Goode."
01:14:25.500,01:14:27.750,"OK, sure, awesome, but then what?"
01:14:28.333,01:14:30.000,Like how do we take out Goode?
01:14:30.083,01:14:31.791,Are y'all serious about this?
01:14:32.583,01:14:36.000,"Once they're down, how quickly can we get the gates back open?"
01:14:42.625,01:14:43.666,"Carrie, cool."
01:14:45.083,01:14:46.250,We'll Carrie him.
01:15:01.750,01:15:02.958,Seriously?
01:15:04.125,01:15:07.250,Look at this dumbass thing. It's bigger than a tape deck.
01:15:07.333,01:15:10.750,"If you want to hear more than one album, you got to carry all that too."
01:15:10.833,01:15:12.416,It skips if you breathe on it.
01:15:12.500,01:15:16.208,"Then listen to the radio, dude. We have a situation here."
01:15:16.791,01:15:21.166,"Yeah, about that, Urkel. Um… what's really going on here?"
01:15:23.583,01:15:26.416,"OK. OK, OK. OK!"
01:15:26.500,01:15:28.791,Cool. There's a half-possessed tied-up white girl.
01:15:28.875,01:15:32.708,"I need you to stay calm, alright? I promise we got this all under control."
01:15:36.250,01:15:38.750,We're gonna kill Sheriff Goode and save Shadyside.
01:15:41.083,01:15:41.916,OK.
01:15:44.541,01:15:46.375,Any tips for fighting these things?
01:15:54.500,01:15:55.666,Try not to die.
01:16:04.333,01:16:05.250,Dig!
01:16:08.250,01:16:09.375,Get ready to run.
01:16:18.000,01:16:19.000,This is it.
01:16:19.750,01:16:20.666,Yep.
01:16:44.958,01:16:48.666,"Never seen a goody bag? All cops got 'em, for emergencies."
01:16:48.750,01:16:50.208,This one's Sheriff Goode's.
01:16:50.791,01:17:00.666,Full of useful stuff. There was this one ti… Those ain't my cans.
01:17:01.166,01:17:02.291,"You're right, Martin."
01:17:02.375,01:17:05.583,These are actually my cans.
01:17:06.083,01:17:08.416,Son of a bitch.
01:17:29.916,01:17:33.166,"I wanted to see if you wanted one of these, uh… headlamps."
01:17:33.250,01:17:37.541,"I know it looks pretty dumb, but… It's perfect."
01:17:43.208,01:17:45.916,"Up, up… down, down."
01:17:46.000,01:17:48.375,"Left, right, left, right, B, A, start."
01:17:48.458,01:17:49.750,What?
01:17:51.416,01:17:52.708,It's the Konami Code.
01:17:52.791,01:17:54.208,It's what you need.
01:17:54.291,01:17:55.875,It's what we all need.
01:17:55.958,01:17:59.583,I have no idea what-- It's the ultimate secret code.
01:17:59.666,01:18:08.875,"Super Contra, Castlevania, Teenage Mutant… It's a code for extra lives."
01:18:09.541,01:18:19.875,"When things get bad at school or whatever, it's… it's what I think about, and it helps me… I don't know, to survive."
01:18:25.500,01:18:27.125,You are the biggest nerd.
01:18:29.416,01:18:31.541,You smell like an androgynous baby.
01:18:32.250,01:18:42.583,"Everyone says Shadyside sucks because it's full of shitty people, that bad things happen here because we're bad, that we deserve what we have coming."
01:18:44.500,01:18:48.375,"That's how it was for Sarah, and that's how it's been for us."
01:18:49.583,01:18:51.166,But it's all bullshit.
01:18:52.375,01:19:01.125,"OK, just because we're weird and smart and different doesn't mean they can feed us through their meat grinder."
01:19:01.625,01:19:02.541,Not anymore.
01:19:02.625,01:19:04.208,It's been three centuries.
01:19:04.291,01:19:06.000,No one else has gotten this far.
01:19:06.083,01:19:08.791,It stops here… tonight.
01:19:08.875,01:19:10.125,It stops with us.
01:19:11.958,01:19:14.458,We're gonna kill this motherfucker.
01:19:16.916,01:19:19.916,"For Sarah, for Kate and Simon."
01:19:21.916,01:19:23.000,For Cindy.
01:19:25.291,01:19:26.541,For all of us.
01:19:29.333,01:19:30.791,For Shadyside.
01:19:40.708,01:19:42.125,Now let's do this.
01:20:56.791,01:20:58.833,"-OK, cut it! -Cut it!"
01:21:31.333,01:21:32.625,I see Martin and Ziggy!
01:21:42.041,01:21:43.333,There's someone here!
01:21:55.041,01:21:57.458,Police! Hands up! Hands up!
01:21:57.541,01:21:59.875,Listen! You don't have any idea what's going on!
01:21:59.958,01:22:01.916,You're gonna die if you don't listen to me!
01:22:04.291,01:22:05.208,Martin?
01:22:05.291,01:22:06.416,"Yeah, yeah!"
01:22:06.500,01:22:08.041,Are you kidding me?
01:22:14.083,01:22:15.500,I got two more over here!
01:22:16.708,01:22:17.958,Drop your weapon!
01:22:18.041,01:22:20.083,"Sir, sir, just please let us explain!"
01:22:23.833,01:22:25.250,Slide it to me.
01:22:30.000,01:23:03.041,"We got the 5150-- OK. I need you to focus because the plan is still on, OK?"
01:23:03.125,01:23:05.875,"-Wait, wait, wait. You're leaving? -Hold fast."
01:23:05.958,01:23:09.750,Stay out of their way. They'll walk right by you.
01:23:12.333,01:23:13.708,Oh! Goodness gracious!
01:23:41.500,01:23:44.666,"Oh my God. He's gonna go right by, he's gonna go right by."
01:23:45.250,01:23:46.750,"OK, don't breathe."
01:24:40.708,01:24:41.958,"Come on, come on."
01:25:32.625,01:25:34.666,"-How many is that? -I got one, Martin got the Milkman."
01:25:34.750,01:25:37.458,Four. We have four.
01:25:39.125,01:25:40.625,"Skull Mask, Nightwing."
01:25:41.666,01:25:42.500,No Ruby?
01:25:42.583,01:25:45.625,-I don't know. We need to keep an eye on-- -Y-Y-Yo!
01:25:47.791,01:25:49.208,Why'd it get so quiet?
01:26:10.500,01:26:11.375,It's him.
01:26:13.291,01:26:14.833,You don't have to do this.
01:26:14.916,01:26:16.041,"Yes, I do."
01:26:24.750,01:26:25.666,Mount up.
01:27:33.625,01:27:40.166,Ziggy… Nick.
01:27:47.875,01:27:49.000,What are you doing here?
01:27:49.500,01:27:50.875,Tag. You're it.
01:28:27.000,01:29:00.833,Oh my… Go! Go! We got him!
01:29:12.541,01:29:15.125,"Oh God, oh God, oh God! No, no, no!"
01:29:15.208,01:29:17.208,"It's my shirt, it's covered in her blood!"
01:30:31.125,01:30:34.750,"OK, we need a plan B, like now."
01:30:40.500,01:30:42.625,We just need more Plan A.
01:31:12.416,01:31:13.500,Nick!
01:31:40.250,01:31:42.625,I got that creepy perv motherfucker in the bullseye.
01:31:45.208,01:31:46.500,"This is gonna work, right?"
01:32:09.541,01:32:10.500,Guys?
01:32:11.208,01:32:12.500,We lost Sam.
01:32:59.125,01:33:03.000,We don't have a lot of time. We have to get ready to fight.
01:33:03.083,01:33:05.791,-Wait! -What the hell is that?
01:33:15.916,01:33:17.125,Ruby.
01:33:22.208,01:33:24.250,"OK. OK, you know what?"
01:33:26.333,01:33:28.333,At least we still have magic blood.
01:33:31.958,01:33:33.041,I'm tapped.
01:33:38.000,01:33:38.916,Me too.
01:33:39.000,01:33:41.375,"No, no, no! We can find other weapons!"
01:33:41.458,01:33:43.583,"We can use the delivery hallway, outflank them."
01:33:43.666,01:33:46.250,-We-- -Or… we can wait it out.
01:33:47.250,01:33:51.000,"No, no! No, we're too close!"
01:33:51.916,01:33:55.333,"Too many people have died, I'm not letting them take my sister too!"
01:33:55.416,01:33:56.500,We have to protect her!
01:33:58.416,01:33:59.458,Please!
01:34:28.250,01:34:31.500,with nothing but words and stone!
01:34:32.833,01:34:38.291,Awakening this power from the depths of the Earth.
01:34:40.041,01:34:46.541,"He extended his hand to the darkness for my family, for me!"
01:34:47.041,01:34:51.250,"300 years it's lived, grown."
01:34:53.708,01:34:56.125,We've sacrificed for it!
01:34:56.208,01:34:59.958,And you think you can stop it?
01:35:02.666,01:35:11.500,"Up, up, down, down… Up, up, down, down… B, A, start!"
01:35:23.125,01:35:25.625,Stop! Stop!
01:35:28.791,01:35:29.791,Sam!
01:35:30.375,01:35:31.625,Stop! No!
01:35:37.375,01:35:38.541,"Ah! Oh, my arm!"
01:35:44.541,01:35:45.875,"Sam, stop!"
01:35:47.208,01:35:50.583,"It's me! Please, please!"
01:35:58.500,01:36:01.708,Get off of me! Get off of me! Get off of me!
01:36:32.916,01:36:33.958,Looking for this?
01:37:00.541,01:37:02.708,No! No! No!
01:37:10.083,01:37:11.625,You're gonna be famous!
01:37:13.666,01:37:17.791,Shadyside's newest piece of shit makes the front page!
01:37:18.375,01:37:24.916,"Local dyke slays girlfriend, friends, brother."
01:37:28.541,01:37:30.833,And they're giving me a fucking medal.
01:37:35.791,01:37:37.125,No!
01:37:59.791,01:38:02.208,I will shadow you for eternity.
01:38:03.625,01:38:04.791,Come on!
01:38:14.916,01:38:18.083,You will feel the grip of my hand.
01:38:19.083,01:38:21.375,I will follow you forever.
01:38:21.458,01:38:24.708,I will never let you go.
01:38:40.333,01:38:41.333,She did it.
01:38:43.875,01:38:45.375,Oh! Oh!
01:38:54.708,01:38:56.250,She fucking did it.
01:39:00.041,01:39:01.041,Sam!
01:39:02.500,01:39:03.791,"Sam, can you hear me?"
01:39:04.541,01:39:05.541,Sam?
01:39:17.875,01:39:18.791,Are you?
01:39:32.875,01:39:34.125,Let's get outta here.
01:40:44.208,01:40:46.416,What in the fuck?
01:41:53.208,01:42:00.083,New evidence continues to surface implicating Union County Sheriff Nicholas Goode the Sunnyvale serial killer.
01:42:00.166,01:42:04.916,The family maintains they had no knowledge of Sheriff Goode's horrifying secret.
01:42:05.000,01:42:07.125,No knowledge? What a bunch of dickheads.
01:42:11.541,01:42:12.583,Oh!
01:42:13.708,01:42:16.166,"Wow, um… Thank you?"
01:42:17.250,01:42:21.250,But you know the doctor said I can't have any of… whatever that is.
01:42:21.916,01:42:25.791,Are you serious? I made those with ingredients and shit.
01:42:28.625,01:42:30.083,"OK, whatever. Get in the car."
01:42:32.416,01:42:33.416,Go.
01:43:03.791,01:43:05.000,"Oh, Nurse Lane!"
01:43:19.833,01:43:21.458,-Pick you up later. -You not coming in?
01:43:22.333,01:43:23.750,"Nah, I got something to do."
01:43:30.625,01:43:34.125,"No CDs, no tapes, no skipping. Look, check that out."
01:43:34.208,01:43:36.375,-It's perfect. -It's bigger than my Discman.
01:43:36.458,01:43:40.000,"Yeah, you know, but look, it fits all your jams and it's portable."
01:43:40.083,01:43:41.666,"So, it's a radio?"
01:43:41.750,01:43:45.958,"No. No, it's not. You know what? Fuck it! Y'all have no fucking vision."
01:43:46.916,01:43:49.041,"I'm telling you, man. It's still too big."
01:43:50.750,01:43:52.375,Solid state drive.
01:43:53.791,01:43:54.875,Flash compression?
01:43:54.958,01:43:58.083,"It'll help with your, uh, size problems."
01:43:59.375,01:44:01.208,Find me online if you want to chat.
01:44:18.875,01:44:21.125,You actually brought cheeseburgers.
01:44:31.750,01:44:33.916,And we're still here because of her.
01:44:42.291,01:44:43.458,"Yeah, you're right."
01:44:44.208,01:44:45.375,I saved your ass.
01:44:46.708,01:44:50.333,"What? It's true, you were dead without me."
