00:13:21.926,00:13:24.345,I can't.
00:13:24.345,00:13:26.723,What if that were me?
00:13:26.723,00:13:30.184,You gonna leave me to die of smoke inhalation? I'm a buck-90.
00:13:30.184,00:13:34.188,How will you pull me out of a burning building if you can't pull a tire 20 yards?
00:13:34.188,00:13:37.108,I'm not strong enough.

00:15:18.585,00:15:20.086,Yeah.

00:18:00.997,00:18:04.542,"She made it to 97, so I figured..."
00:18:04.542,00:18:07.127,I'd give it a shot.
00:18:09.630,00:18:15.803,And one day we'd have something to talk about when we get together.
00:18:19.974,00:18:23.019,"Wow, a hundred books."
00:18:23.019,00:18:25.939,Holy moly.
00:18:25.939,00:18:28.900,"How many have you read, Robert?"
00:18:30.985,00:18:33.071,"Sorry, this damn thing."
00:18:33.071,00:18:34.781,"Ninety-one books, though."
00:18:34.781,00:18:37.909,You're almost done.
00:18:37.909,00:18:39.702,What are you gonna do after that?
00:18:39.702,00:18:41.120,Take singing lessons.
00:18:42.663,00:18:44.916,Then I'm gonna open a donut factory.
00:18:44.916,00:18:48.502,Heh-heh-heh.
00:18:58.137,00:18:59.847,ALINA: I love being up at this hour.
00:18:59.847,00:19:01.432,ROBERT: Yeah?
00:19:01.432,00:19:03.893,"ALINA: Yeah. You know, everything's so dark."
00:19:03.893,00:19:06.896,It makes everything seem possible again.
00:19:08.230,00:19:10.566,"Yeah, me, I can't sleep at night."
00:19:10.566,00:19:14.236,"ALINA: Yeah, well, I get to hear your stories."
00:19:14.236,00:19:16.196,What's your new one about?
00:19:16.196,00:19:20.034,"Oh, it's about a guy who thinks he's a knight in shining armor."
00:19:20.034,00:19:25.039,"The only thing is, he lives in a world where knights don't exist anymore."
00:19:25.039,00:19:28.042,Kind of sounds like my world. Heh.
00:19:30.128,00:19:32.046,ROBERT: I'm just up the block.
00:19:32.046,00:19:35.299,ALINA: I'm gonna grab a cab or something.
00:19:35.299,00:19:37.844,"Thank you for the quiet voice, Robert."
00:19:39.095,00:19:41.430,"You are very welcome, Alina."
00:19:41.430,00:19:42.932,Yeah.
00:19:42.932,00:19:46.268,"Catch you around, all right?"
00:19:46.268,00:19:48.270,Shit.
00:19:48.270,00:19:50.106,See you.
00:19:53.317,00:19:56.612,"What did you do, huh?"
00:19:56.612,00:19:57.989,What did you do to that customer?
00:19:57.989,00:20:01.241,"Slavi, he hit me."
00:20:01.241,00:20:03.828,Who do you think you are? Hm?
00:20:03.828,00:20:05.287,It's all right.
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.914,Understand.
00:20:06.914,00:20:08.541,"It's all right, Robert."
00:20:08.541,00:20:11.669,SLAVI: Let's talk about you not answering my calls.
00:20:13.087,00:20:14.338,Bitch!
00:20:14.338,00:20:16.883,Should we give him a card?
00:20:19.635,00:20:23.472,"This girl, she's no good."
00:20:23.472,00:20:27.351,Call this number.
00:20:34.692,00:20:36.360,Don't be shy. Make the call.
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.404,Understand.
00:21:26.410,00:21:27.828,JAKE: Coffee?
00:21:27.828,00:21:29.830,MAN: We need more sugar out here.
00:21:52.352,00:21:54.772,I heard she's at the ICU at Shawmuts.
00:21:54.772,00:21:56.440,Someone beat her up real good.
00:22:04.073,00:22:09.369,Dr. Paley to ICU.
00:22:14.000,00:22:16.002,Dr. Mark to the pharmacy.
00:22:16.002,00:22:17.628,"Dr. Mark to the pharmacy, please."
00:22:29.015,00:22:31.017,Alina.
00:22:50.452,00:22:55.791,"Hey, you'll be okay, Alina."
00:23:22.276,00:23:25.988,ROBERT: Oh. Watch it.
00:23:25.988,00:23:28.991,MANDY: It's okay. It's okay.
00:23:28.991,00:23:33.120,I can-- It's fine. Thank you.
00:23:34.580,00:23:35.956,How's she doing?
00:23:38.125,00:23:39.543,Alina. How's she doing?
00:23:40.794,00:23:44.340,Who are you?
00:23:51.471,00:23:53.307,A guy hit her.
00:23:54.934,00:23:58.062,And she hit him back.
00:23:58.062,00:24:00.814,A guy called Slavi.
00:24:02.775,00:24:05.694,So Slavi made example of her.
00:24:06.904,00:24:08.614,They do that.
00:24:08.614,00:24:12.034,They burned one girl's face with battery acid.
00:24:12.034,00:24:17.123,Keep her around as a reminder for the rest of us.
00:24:19.166,00:24:21.877,They brought Teri over very young.
00:24:21.877,00:24:28.717,Think she got to the point where she thought her life could be hers one day.
00:24:28.717,00:24:32.012,Slavi reminded her it never would be.
00:24:34.181,00:24:38.727,He said he'd cut her throat next time.
00:24:38.727,00:24:44.817,He said a whore who fucks and can't talk might be worth twice as much.
00:25:28.610,00:25:31.489,ALINA: You and I know what I really am.
00:25:31.489,00:25:34.492,It's something in your eyes.
00:25:34.492,00:25:36.952,ROBERT: Change your world.
00:25:36.952,00:25:40.164,MANDY: He said he'd cut her throat next time.
00:25:57.139,00:26:00.600,Why is that piece of shit in my parking space?
00:26:07.483,00:26:09.026,"BARTENDER: Hi, Slavi."
00:26:11.569,00:26:14.156,Yes.
00:26:36.594,00:26:38.347,Yes.
00:26:38.347,00:26:39.932,He asked for forgiveness.
00:26:42.059,00:26:44.562,Forgiveness?
00:26:44.562,00:26:47.314,TEVI: I told him.
00:26:47.314,00:26:50.776,"What am I, Jesus Christ?"
00:27:10.421,00:27:12.630,"You lost, dedushka?"
00:27:12.630,00:27:15.217,How did he get up here?
00:27:15.217,00:27:18.095,TEVI: I don't know.
00:27:19.513,00:27:21.390,No.
00:27:23.725,00:27:26.061,I'm here for that girl.
00:27:27.771,00:27:30.399,You gave me that a couple of nights ago.
00:27:32.485,00:27:34.111,We give out lots of cards.
00:27:34.111,00:27:36.905,"You still can get it up, dedushka?"
00:27:41.368,00:27:44.330,I'm here about a certain girl.
00:27:44.330,00:27:47.040,She got beat up pretty bad.
00:27:47.040,00:27:52.254,"I'm thinking that maybe you have wrong address, dedushka."
00:27:59.553,00:28:01.263,"This girl, she have name?"
00:28:01.263,00:28:03.807,Her name's Alina.
00:28:03.807,00:28:05.892,Mm-mm.
00:28:05.892,00:28:08.395,"No, it doesn't ring a bell."
00:28:08.395,00:28:11.857,"But whoever she is, she must know how to suck the cock."
00:28:19.573,00:28:22.951,Uh... Okay. Um...
00:28:22.951,00:28:25.162,"Look, I understand."
00:28:25.162,00:28:27.956,"These girls that you, uh..."
00:28:27.956,00:28:29.791,That you represent.
00:28:29.791,00:28:35.047,"I understand it's like they're an investment, so, um..."
00:28:35.047,00:28:38.050,I can give you $9800.
00:28:39.718,00:28:42.179,It's cash.
00:28:42.179,00:28:44.473,You're wanting to give me $9000?
00:28:44.473,00:28:46.766,Ninety-eight hundred. Cash.
00:28:46.766,00:28:50.145,For what?
00:28:50.145,00:28:51.647,"Uh-huh. Heh, heh."
00:28:51.647,00:28:54.858,Can you believe this guy?
00:28:54.858,00:28:58.820,This guy gonna give me $9000 for one single piece of pussy.
00:28:58.820,00:29:02.366,"Ah, must be Ferrari pussy."
00:29:06.412,00:29:11.083,You fucking Americans think you can come into my place and buy whatever you want.
00:29:11.083,00:29:15.713,"Beautiful Russian girls, no problem, just throw down this bullshit money."
00:29:18.382,00:29:21.260,You fucking insult me.
00:29:31.770,00:29:35.441,Ha-ha-ha.
00:29:35.441,00:29:39.737,But you got very big balls coming in here. I like that.
00:29:39.737,00:29:44.950,"So, $9000 for the troublemaker."
00:29:57.963,00:29:59.839,One month.
00:29:59.839,00:30:01.467,That's it.
00:30:01.467,00:30:03.719,You think this is one-time payment?
00:30:03.719,00:30:05.845,I make this off this girl in two weeks.
00:30:05.845,00:30:08.599,That girl is still child.
00:30:08.599,00:30:11.310,"I still can sell her as virgin, huh?"
00:30:11.310,00:30:13.604,This makes prime earner for good while.
00:30:17.566,00:30:22.738,Take your fucking money and go back to your house and jerk off 9800 times.
00:30:22.738,00:30:25.324,"Then come crawling back here and talk to me, huh?"
00:30:25.324,00:30:27.660,She'll be used up by then for sure.
00:30:27.660,00:30:31.204,Maybe then I will let you have her for nothing. Hm?
00:30:44.009,00:30:45.552,Okay.
00:31:02.402,00:31:05.322,"You're okay, dedushka?"
00:31:05.322,00:31:07.866,You know amerikantsy.
00:31:28.094,00:31:29.555,You forget something?
00:32:13.014,00:32:15.058,Sixteen seconds.
00:32:17.686,00:32:22.315,"One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand."
00:33:02.981,00:33:04.274,Eight one-thousand.
00:33:08.612,00:33:10.196,Understand?
00:33:21.374,00:33:24.294,"Twenty-eight minus 9, 19."
00:33:27.673,00:33:29.007,Nineteen.
00:33:46.733,00:33:49.402,Your heart's beating three times the normal rate.
00:33:49.402,00:33:51.864,Because you're losing so much blood.
00:33:51.864,00:33:59.997,"About 30 seconds, your body's gonna shut down and you're gonna suffocate."
00:33:59.997,00:34:03.416,"Alina, the girl you beat half to death, her life will go on."
00:34:03.416,00:34:09.756,"Yours is gonna end right here, on this funky floor over $9800."
00:34:12.676,00:34:14.803,You should have taken the money.
00:34:17.931,00:34:21.601,Who are you?
00:34:21.601,00:34:29.108,"Twenty-six one-thousand, 27 one-thousand, 28 one-thousand."
00:34:38.493,00:34:40.871,I'm sorry.
00:35:47.186,00:35:49.940,"RALPHIE: Mr. McCall, it's lunchtime."
00:35:51.024,00:35:54.152,Mr. McCall.
00:35:57.155,00:36:00.158,"You test tomorrow, and you're still eating that?"
00:36:00.158,00:36:01.868,These are for you.
00:36:04.871,00:36:06.748,Open it.
00:36:11.128,00:36:13.088,I made the weight.
00:36:13.088,00:36:16.967,Tomorrow I'm gonna ace that test. Thanks to you.
00:36:16.967,00:36:19.845,What happened?
00:36:19.845,00:36:22.221,Hit it on something stupid.
00:36:54.629,00:37:03.930,"In what investigators are calling a gangland-style execution, five men were killed at some point last night in an office above this restaurant."
00:37:03.930,00:37:09.811,Police sources have said the killings have all the earmarks of a turf war between rival factions.
00:37:09.811,00:37:31.624,Names are not yet being released-- MASTERS: How's it going?
00:37:31.624,00:37:33.710,"PEDERSON: How you doing, sir?"
00:37:33.710,00:37:36.088,TEDDY: I know who you are.
00:37:41.843,00:37:45.180,Take me to the murder scene.
00:38:57.252,00:39:01.589,"MASTERS: We figured two, maybe three guys killed them all that quickly."
00:39:01.589,00:39:04.050,"PEDERSON: If it was a power play, no one saw it coming."
00:39:04.050,00:39:07.095,None of our informants heard about this going down.
00:39:07.095,00:39:10.015,Security system's drive was taken so we're blind in here.
00:39:10.015,00:39:14.227,"At 11:17, a waiter goes up with a tray of food, finds them dead."
00:39:14.227,00:39:19.065,I want images from every security camera within a six-block radius.
00:39:19.065,00:39:23.736,"If you have any trouble, call that number..."
00:39:23.736,00:39:25.530,and it will be taken care of.
00:39:26.948,00:39:29.951,Phones charged and on.
00:39:29.951,00:39:33.121,"Now, if you could drive me to my residence."
00:39:33.121,00:39:36.708,"Hey, wait a second, Mr. Sunshine. Um..."
00:39:36.708,00:39:39.127,What do I look like to you?
00:39:42.964,00:39:46.259,This is our town.
00:39:53.558,00:39:55.601,Let me apologize for my conduct.
00:39:55.601,00:40:01.858,"It was a long flight on short notice, and I like to focus, to work quickly."
00:40:01.858,00:40:05.820,The deaths of Mr. Pushkin's men have interrupted his operations here.
00:40:05.820,00:40:09.282,"Imports, movements of goods, have all ceased."
00:40:09.282,00:40:11.117,That's unacceptable.
00:40:11.117,00:40:14.954,I'm the one Mr. Pushkin calls in when people like you fuck up.
00:40:14.954,00:40:18.166,Mm. I don't like your tone-- I'm accountable now.
00:40:18.166,00:40:21.460,You have taken Mr. Pushkin's money for years.
00:40:21.460,00:40:23.838,Money that comes with conditions.
00:40:23.838,00:40:25.715,Non-negotiable conditions.
00:40:25.715,00:40:29.344,Problem you're having with me is you think you matter. You don't.
00:40:29.344,00:40:32.764,I am all that matters.
00:40:29.344,00:40:37.102,And so we're clear: I'm not here to say please.
00:40:37.102,00:40:39.229,I'm here to tell you what to do.
00:40:44.192,00:40:46.194,Be ready for business.
00:40:46.194,00:40:48.821,We open tomorrow.
00:40:53.118,00:40:54.786,"Brian, you seen Ralphie?"
00:40:54.786,00:40:57.247,Supposed to be taking that security guard test after work.
00:40:57.247,00:40:59.249,Called in and quit.
00:40:59.249,00:41:03.253,No notice either.
00:41:22.772,00:41:24.232,We're closed.
00:41:24.232,00:41:26.276,Mr. McCall.
00:41:26.276,00:41:28.320,Heard you quit today.
00:41:28.320,00:41:29.695,Uh...
00:41:29.695,00:41:31.406,"Oh, uh..."
00:41:31.406,00:41:33.574,My mom had a little accident here last night.
00:41:33.574,00:41:35.201,There was a fire.
00:41:35.201,00:41:37.120,ROBERT: I see.
00:41:37.120,00:41:39.372,So I'm gonna help out around here now.
00:41:41.124,00:41:44.127,Okay.
00:41:58.808,00:42:01.227,We have a lot of work to do.
00:42:01.227,00:42:03.229,"Yeah, so-- Need some help?"
00:42:03.229,00:42:06.191,"Yeah, if you're not doing anything, that'd be awesome."
00:42:06.191,00:42:07.650,Helping you.
00:42:17.576,00:42:20.538,"MASTERS: Teddy, I checked this out."
00:42:20.538,00:42:22.123,"They had nothing to do with it, huh?"
00:42:22.123,00:42:24.417,You gonna sit down with all these guys?
00:42:24.417,00:42:27.462,I'm telling you.
00:42:27.462,00:42:29.588,Duly noted.
00:42:53.821,00:42:57.283,"MASTERS: Listen, huh?"
00:42:57.283,00:43:01.120,"Whatever you do, don't call him Little John, okay?"
00:43:01.120,00:43:05.041,"Frank, why you working for these fucking Russians?"
00:43:05.041,00:43:07.085,My money not good enough?
00:43:07.085,00:43:09.504,"MASTERS: John, you know I respect your business."
00:43:09.504,00:43:15.676,"Mr. Looney, you understand why I'm compelled to make this visit."
00:43:15.676,00:43:20.056,I don't know shit about what went down or who you should be out looking for.
00:43:20.056,00:43:23.642,"If I wanna take over anything, I'd fucking do it."
00:43:23.642,00:43:25.644,There'd be nothing left to you.
00:43:25.644,00:43:28.981,So maybe you just don't understand who the fuck I am.
00:43:28.981,00:43:31.192,"John. Easy, huh?"
00:43:31.192,00:43:34.070,Shut the fuck up!
00:43:34.070,00:43:36.739,"See, I hate you fucking Russians."
00:43:36.739,00:43:39.451,"You're all crazy, and you're arrogant."
00:43:39.451,00:43:43.829,"Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream."
00:43:43.829,00:43:47.666,"You people come over here to steal it, so fuck all of you."
00:43:47.666,00:43:50.295,"Well, Mr. Looney, I appreciate your candor."
00:43:50.295,00:43:55.425,It's refreshing and lets me understand you're not smart enough to have done this.
00:43:55.425,00:43:58.052,The fuck?
00:43:58.052,00:44:02.223,We pay you 15 percent to do business here.
00:44:02.223,00:44:04.934,"The additional 10 percent you steal, we ignore."
00:44:04.934,00:44:07.312,"We anticipated it, as you people are such clichés."
00:44:07.312,00:44:11.857,"The fact that you're a rat to the Feds is also tolerable, Little John."
00:44:11.857,00:44:14.402,The fuck?
00:44:11.857,00:44:21.618,"What we will not tolerate is getting nothing for our money: no information, no protection, no assurances."
00:44:21.618,00:44:24.370,Who do you think you are?
00:44:24.370,00:44:28.625,Who I am is complicated. What I am is easier. I'm a threat.
00:44:28.625,00:44:32.462,I alter outcomes.
00:44:40.094,00:44:44.015,"Whoa, doctor! Call a doctor."
00:44:44.015,00:44:46.017,It's Napoli in the clutch!
00:44:46.017,00:44:48.227,Holy cow!
00:44:50.647,00:44:52.565,"Oh, fuck!"
00:44:54.400,00:44:56.110,A tie game. Unbelievable!
00:44:56.110,00:44:59.989,That ball was absolutely massacred by Mike Napoli.
00:45:05.702,00:45:07.788,A home run by Napoli.
00:45:07.788,00:45:10.707,"Boy, can things change."
00:45:10.707,00:45:13.919,This game was over before this half-inning started.
00:45:13.919,00:45:15.505,It is certainly over now!
00:45:15.505,00:45:20.092,"The final: six to five, Boston over New York..."
00:45:26.765,00:45:28.601,Hey!
00:45:28.601,00:45:31.187,Hey! Hey.
00:45:31.187,00:45:34.357,This is my town. Do you understand me? This is my home.
00:45:34.357,00:45:37.026,You cannot run around like a wild animal.
00:45:37.026,00:45:38.903,What the fuck was that?
00:45:38.903,00:45:41.030,It's a message.
00:45:41.030,00:45:43.575,"It says, I'm here."
00:45:54.126,00:45:56.879,"ROBERT: What really happened in there, Ralphie?"
00:45:59.298,00:46:01.551,Faulty wire or something.
00:46:01.551,00:46:03.386,We both know that's not true.
00:46:05.888,00:46:09.975,I'm sorry I wasted your time.
00:46:09.975,00:46:13.020,My mom doesn't have much except this place.
00:46:13.020,00:46:20.111,"And when stuff like this happens, I just gotta put everything on hold for a while and help her out, you know?"
00:46:21.613,00:46:23.239,What was I thinking?
00:46:23.239,00:46:26.242,I wasn't gonna pass the security guard test anyway.
00:46:30.622,00:46:35.418,Was there anything unusually strange about Slavi before he was murdered?
00:46:36.669,00:46:38.795,Did he mention a name perhaps?
00:46:38.795,00:46:40.839,Agitated about something?
00:46:40.839,00:46:44.843,Slavi never did his business in front of the girls.
00:46:44.843,00:46:46.262,Tevi handled us.
00:46:46.262,00:46:51.142,We can't locate one of the other girls from Slavi's stable.
00:46:54.479,00:46:56.813,You know her?
00:46:56.813,00:47:00.067,Where we might find her?
00:47:01.653,00:47:05.323,I didn't know her that well.
00:47:10.662,00:47:13.205,"Was my message received, Teddy?"
00:47:13.205,00:47:14.831,"TEDDY: Yes, Mr. Pushkin."
00:47:14.831,00:47:18.210,"All of our associates-- Irish, Italians, Armenians."
00:47:18.210,00:47:21.838,--are all denying any knowledge or involvement.
00:47:21.838,00:47:25.677,We cannot show weakness.
00:47:25.677,00:47:27.512,It will be.
00:47:27.512,00:47:29.597,"Of course, don't worry."
00:47:29.597,00:47:31.474,Good.
00:47:31.474,00:47:34.101,Now enough of what you don't know.
00:47:34.101,00:47:35.978,Tell me what you do know.
00:47:37.854,00:47:43.653,"Well, I'm still sifting through things, but the killings were spontaneous."
00:47:43.653,00:47:47.490,Whoever did this specialized in killing.
00:47:47.490,00:47:49.992,I've rarely seen skills like this.
00:47:49.992,00:47:52.953,I don't think it's someone we've encountered before.
00:47:52.953,00:47:55.581,"Whoever it is, just find him, Teddy."
00:47:55.581,00:47:58.626,"I'm talking over a million barrels, this delivery."
00:47:58.626,00:47:59.918,Understand?
00:47:59.918,00:48:01.504,It will all be well.
00:48:01.504,00:48:03.964,I'll take care of it.
00:48:03.964,00:48:06.425,"When you do, be loud about it."
00:48:06.425,00:48:08.803,I don't want this happening again.
00:48:08.803,00:48:10.722,Of course.
00:48:52.263,00:48:54.473,Come on.
00:48:54.473,00:48:55.974,Stuff it in.
00:48:55.974,00:48:57.769,See that?
00:48:57.769,00:49:00.396,That son of a bitch.
00:49:00.396,00:49:02.815,GILLY: Yeah.
00:49:08.738,00:49:11.365,We're closed. Get out.
00:49:11.365,00:49:12.909,Time to go.
00:49:14.326,00:49:15.661,HARRIS: Nice to see you.
00:49:25.170,00:49:28.549,"See? You pay on time, no more problems."
00:49:28.549,00:49:30.635,Ha-ha-ha.
00:49:32.428,00:49:35.389,"Mamacita, you need to clean the grease."
00:49:35.389,00:49:37.516,It'll cause a fire.
00:49:37.516,00:49:39.017,HARRIS: See you next week.
00:49:41.646,00:49:43.940,GILLY: Let's go get a blowie.
00:49:43.940,00:49:47.025,"HARRIS: Whoa, put the light down."
00:49:47.025,00:49:48.569,ROBERT: I'd like to report a crime.
00:49:48.569,00:49:50.655,Really? Call 911.
00:49:50.655,00:49:52.782,GILLY: Let's get out of here.
00:49:52.782,00:49:54.867,HARRIS: Should've shot that motherfucker.
00:49:54.867,00:49:56.744,Take it easy.
00:49:56.744,00:49:58.245,How did you get this job?
00:49:58.245,00:50:01.332,I blew the commissioner.
00:50:01.332,00:50:05.503,Why waste city services when I got two corrupt cops right in front of me?
00:50:05.503,00:50:08.881,It's that guy.
00:50:08.881,00:50:10.842,Yeah.
00:50:23.395,00:50:25.731,How'd you get that number?
00:50:25.731,00:50:27.984,HARRIS: Yeah?
00:50:27.984,00:50:30.068,HARRIS: Ask the lady down the street.
00:50:30.068,00:50:32.028,The one who had the fire.
00:50:32.028,00:50:35.449,Same thing could happen to you with your whole family inside.
00:50:35.449,00:50:36.826,GILLY: Open it.
00:50:36.826,00:50:39.704,HARRIS: You pay like everybody else.
00:50:39.704,00:50:42.540,How many copies?
00:50:42.540,00:50:43.749,One.
00:50:43.749,00:50:46.002,"You must have a death wish, pal."
00:50:46.002,00:50:49.380,"What the fuck do you want, huh? Huh?"
00:50:49.380,00:50:54.593,"Those people you took the money from, you should give it back."
00:50:54.593,00:50:57.304,That would be in the best interest of everyone.
00:50:57.304,00:50:58.931,Really?
00:50:58.931,00:51:04.854,"Maybe our best interest is to tie a block around you and throw you in the Mystic, huh?"
00:51:04.854,00:51:07.773,Let's do that.
00:51:14.279,00:51:17.950,"You're supposed to stand for something, punk."
00:51:17.950,00:51:19.159,Fuck.
00:51:19.159,00:51:22.538,Protect and serve.
00:51:22.538,00:51:24.665,Justice.
00:51:24.665,00:51:27.251,Remember?
00:51:34.008,00:51:37.511,Who the fuck are you?
00:51:37.511,00:51:41.807,ROBERT: Tomorrow you'll have returned all the money you extorted from those people.
00:51:41.807,00:51:43.642,Tell them it will never happen again.
00:51:43.642,00:51:47.021,Do that and this video will never be seen.
00:51:47.021,00:51:53.736,"You don't, and a half an hour later, you'll watch the uncut version on every news outlet in the area."
00:51:53.736,00:51:58.156,"Now, I'm offering you a chance to do the right thing. Take it."
00:51:58.156,00:52:00.952,That fucking hurt more than the beating.
00:52:15.007,00:52:19.511,RALPHIE: Mr. McCall. Are you done standing around or what?
00:52:29.063,00:52:31.816,TEDDY: All the other girls have...
00:52:31.816,00:52:38.781,claimed that you were very close to Teri. Huh?
00:52:42.034,00:52:44.369,You lied to me about that.
00:52:52.461,00:52:53.712,It's pretty.
00:53:07.685,00:53:10.521,When did you last talk to her?
00:53:11.981,00:53:17.569,Over a week ago.
00:53:17.569,00:53:19.905,I went to the hospital.
00:53:19.905,00:53:22.950,"Uh, I saw her there."
00:53:23.868,00:53:27.163,Did anyone else visit her?
00:53:27.163,00:53:28.372,Yes.
00:53:28.372,00:53:30.290,A man.
00:53:30.290,00:53:32.793,Customer?
00:53:32.793,00:53:35.337,A nice man.
00:53:35.337,00:53:37.756,He wanted to know what happened to her.
00:53:37.756,00:53:39.050,His name?
00:53:39.050,00:53:41.593,He didn't say.
00:53:44.596,00:53:46.390,"And your friend, Teri?"
00:53:46.390,00:53:50.728,No one saw her after she left hospital.
00:53:50.728,00:53:53.814,After what they did to her.
00:53:53.814,00:53:55.983,And you contacted her?
00:53:55.983,00:53:58.736,No one saw her.
00:53:58.736,00:54:01.530,Look at me. Are you telling me the truth?
00:54:01.530,00:54:03.157,You telling me the truth?
00:54:03.157,00:54:04.366,Yes. Yes.
00:54:04.366,00:54:07.078,You telling me the truth?
00:54:07.078,00:54:10.039,Telling me the truth?
00:54:20.007,00:54:22.009,Would you like some water?
00:54:23.844,00:54:26.222,Moisten your throat.
00:54:32.853,00:54:35.022,Thank you.
00:54:36.232,00:54:37.524,Sweet.
00:54:38.734,00:54:41.028,My angel.
00:54:41.028,00:54:44.322,Hm? Yes.
00:54:48.786,00:54:50.037,So beautiful.
00:54:50.037,00:54:52.664,"Please, please, Teddy."
00:54:52.664,00:54:54.833,But so deceitful.
00:54:54.833,00:54:57.377,So fucking deceitful.
00:54:57.377,00:55:00.256,You're-- You're hurting me!
00:55:00.256,00:55:02.591,Please stop.
00:55:43.841,00:55:45.467,"MAN 1: Let's go, Home Mart!"
00:55:45.467,00:55:47.928,MAN 2: Let's go!
00:55:49.554,00:55:54.059,"Here we go. Oh, oh, oh!"
00:55:54.059,00:55:57.896,MAN 4: Yeah!
00:55:57.896,00:56:00.398,"MAN 6: There you go! Way to go, Bobby!"
00:56:01.817,00:56:05.237,MAN 7: There's no place like Home Mart.
00:56:06.322,00:56:07.990,Yeah.
00:56:12.452,00:56:14.038,BOTH: Oh!
00:56:14.038,00:56:17.541,MARCUS: I see you!
00:56:17.541,00:56:20.085,JENNY: You passed your test!
00:56:20.085,00:56:21.920,"MARCUS: Looking good, man."
00:56:21.920,00:56:23.547,"Hey, did they give you a gun?"
00:56:35.893,00:56:38.062,PEDERSON: What the hell he call us in here for?
00:56:38.062,00:56:40.898,MASTERS: Maybe he's finally done chasing his own tail.
00:56:40.898,00:56:44.318,He needs to go home.
00:56:44.318,00:56:47.238,"MASTERS: Yeah, that sounds about right."
00:56:47.238,00:56:51.575,I matched the arrival and departure times of everyone going in and out of the restaurant.
00:56:51.575,00:56:53.077,I discovered a curious thing.
00:56:53.077,00:57:00.251,"This person walks in the front door several minutes after Slavi arrived, but never comes out."
00:57:03.628,00:57:07.091,All right. Later. All right.
00:57:09.801,00:57:11.929,"Jenny, Jenny, Jenny."
00:57:11.929,00:57:14.514,Can you do a quick card refund for me?
00:57:14.514,00:57:18.560,Gentleman's in a hurry.
00:57:18.560,00:57:21.688,"Move, move."
00:57:21.688,00:57:24.108,"Go ahead, open this thing up."
00:57:24.108,00:57:26.735,Tell this bitch to fucking move it.
00:57:26.735,00:57:28.445,Open the register up right now.
00:57:30.364,00:57:31.865,Move.
00:57:33.491,00:57:36.245,All of it.
00:57:39.123,00:57:41.541,Come on.
00:57:45.170,00:57:47.047,That ring too.
00:57:47.047,00:57:49.967,JENNY: No.
00:57:49.967,00:57:52.469,JENNY: Please. It was my mother's.
00:57:52.469,00:57:54.846,Fuck your mother.
00:58:25.836,00:58:28.172,Take it off.
00:58:28.172,00:58:29.923,Shh.
00:58:29.923,00:58:32.217,I don't care.
00:58:32.217,00:58:35.262,JENNY: Please.
00:59:11.006,00:59:12.299,You okay?
00:59:12.299,00:59:13.967,Yeah.
00:59:19.973,00:59:24.186,"Hey, listen. Police said the guy's done four like this."
00:59:24.186,00:59:28.899,"Shot a guy over in Somerville a month ago, so..."
00:59:28.899,00:59:30.775,It's only money.
01:00:23.287,01:00:24.621,You okay?
01:00:24.621,01:00:27.165,"Hey, Ralphie. Still a little freaked out."
01:00:27.165,01:00:29.751,"Well, if you need anything, let me know."
01:00:29.751,01:00:32.045,"JENNY: Thanks, Ralphie."
01:00:36.508,01:00:39.719,"Oh, my God."
01:00:39.719,01:00:41.597,My ring?
01:01:37.444,01:01:40.738,Mr. McCall. Sorry to bother you.
01:01:40.738,01:01:44.201,We're looking into a homicide that occurred two weeks ago.
01:01:44.201,01:01:46.870,Five dead.
01:01:46.870,01:01:49.373,I heard about it on TV.
01:01:49.373,01:01:51.291,"Oh, you were?"
01:01:51.291,01:01:53.377,You wouldn't be here if I wasn't.
01:01:53.377,01:01:55.462,That's right.
01:01:53.377,01:01:58.507,We're just checking to see if any of the patrons remembered anything suspicious.
01:01:58.507,01:02:00.091,Not that I recall.
01:02:00.091,01:02:02.886,May I ask why you dined at that particular restaurant?
01:02:02.886,01:02:06.306,I like pirozhki.
01:02:02.886,01:02:08.725,There's five Russian restaurants in walking distance of your apartment.
01:02:08.725,01:02:11.019,I assume they all serve pirozhki.
01:02:11.019,01:02:14.272,Wow. I was meeting a friend.
01:02:14.272,01:02:17.025,Then I guess I should talk-- Sheila Saunders.
01:02:17.025,01:02:19.027,But she won't be any help.
01:02:19.027,01:02:23.031,She wasn't there.
01:02:23.031,01:02:25.576,Didn't stay long?
01:02:25.576,01:02:28.036,"I see. Well, thanks for your cooperation."
01:02:28.036,01:02:32.790,Very welcome.
01:02:35.168,01:02:38.046,"Yeah, I don't know..."
01:02:38.046,01:02:40.757,I don't remember where from.
01:02:40.757,01:02:42.300,She fell down and broke her neck.
01:02:42.300,01:02:44.177,Did she?
01:02:44.177,01:02:46.430,I'll be in touch.
01:02:46.430,01:02:49.266,"Don't you wanna leave me your card, officer?"
01:02:49.266,01:02:50.892,In case I remember anything?
01:02:50.892,01:02:53.520,"That's what you policemen usually do, right?"
01:02:53.520,01:02:56.981,Must have given them all out.
01:02:56.981,01:03:00.026,I paid cash. No reservation.
01:03:00.026,01:03:02.571,"Well, that's what we do, Mr. McCall."
01:03:02.571,01:03:03.863,We who?
01:03:03.863,01:03:06.658,We find people we need to find.
01:03:38.356,01:03:41.818,Everything about him is wrong.
01:04:32.786,01:04:36.623,TEDDY: And his military history?
01:04:36.623,01:04:38.291,No.
01:04:38.291,01:04:40.251,Keep digging.
01:04:40.251,01:04:46.007,This is what we have on McCall so far: College-educated. Works a straight 40 at the Home Mart.
01:04:46.007,01:04:50.387,"Bank statements, tax returns, all jive."
01:04:50.387,01:04:52.055,Looks pretty normal.
01:04:52.055,01:04:55.266,All lies. Fabricated.
01:05:05.276,01:05:07.237,TEDDY: We need to take him cleanly.
01:05:07.237,01:05:08.822,Alive.
01:05:08.822,01:05:11.324,"A place without cameras, no witnesses."
01:05:21.626,01:05:26.297,"A man with his skills, I want to know who he really is."
01:05:26.297,01:05:29.300,I want to know who he's working for.
01:05:38.602,01:05:41.062,MAN: How you doing?
01:05:41.062,01:05:42.856,"Give me a coffee, please."
01:05:42.856,01:05:47.318,An egg sandwich too. On a roll.
01:05:47.318,01:05:50.029,JAKE: You got it.
01:05:50.029,01:05:51.489,I'll be back in a minute.
01:05:55.368,01:05:59.623,"Is it just you, or are we waiting for someone else?"
01:05:59.623,01:06:00.874,I'm sorry. What?
01:06:00.874,01:06:02.918,Your hands.
01:06:02.918,01:06:06.463,"If you really worked the power lines, your hands wouldn't look like that."
01:06:06.463,01:06:08.757,We gotta be waiting for somebody else.
01:06:10.550,01:06:11.676,Motherfucker.
01:06:20.435,01:06:23.730,Hands where I can see them.
01:06:23.730,01:06:27.525,We're gonna take a little walk across the street. Black Denali.
01:06:27.525,01:06:29.026,Here we go.
01:06:34.157,01:06:36.451,MASTERS: What the fuck?
01:06:36.451,01:06:40.330,"Vary from these instructions and I'll kill you, understand?"
01:06:41.498,01:06:43.207,All right.
01:06:44.208,01:06:46.586,Stand up.
01:06:58.348,01:07:01.351,What the fuck is this?
01:07:01.351,01:07:02.853,No witnesses.
01:07:02.853,01:07:04.980,MAN: What's going on out there?
01:07:19.410,01:07:21.788,What the fuck?
01:07:21.788,01:07:23.540,Shh.
01:07:23.540,01:07:25.667,MASTERS: What the hell is this guy doing?
01:07:41.933,01:07:44.101,"MASTERS: Remar, you got A side."
01:07:44.101,01:07:46.646,You got C. I got B.
01:07:46.646,01:07:48.023,Alive.
01:07:48.023,01:07:50.901,"MASTERS: Yeah, yeah, alive. I'm on it."
01:09:06.935,01:09:08.561,Motherfucker.
01:09:12.523,01:09:14.985,Motherfucker suckered me.
01:09:24.160,01:09:25.829,Goddamn it.
01:11:29.619,01:11:31.662,MASTERS: Shit.
01:11:45.009,01:11:48.888,"Pederson, check the closets, the kitchen, the back porch."
01:11:50.807,01:11:53.101,PEDERSON: Closet's empty.
01:11:55.270,01:11:57.021,Nothing on the back porch.
01:11:57.021,01:11:59.732,REMAR: Fucking guy.
01:12:01.025,01:12:03.945,This guy's got a lot of books.
01:12:03.945,01:12:07.740,"MASTERS: Remar, stop fucking around."
01:12:21.296,01:12:23.380,"MASTERS: This place is way too clean, boss."
01:12:23.380,01:12:25.883,Something doesn't feel right.
01:12:29.053,01:12:32.765,MASTERS: We've got an empty script.
01:12:34.309,01:12:36.644,It's used for airsickness.
01:12:36.644,01:12:38.938,Travel items purchased three days ago.
01:12:38.938,01:12:43.484,Bought an open-ended plane ticket to Mexico two days ago.
01:12:43.484,01:12:45.236,Leaves Logan 10 a.m. tomorrow.
01:12:45.236,01:12:47.322,Guy knew this was coming.
01:12:47.322,01:12:49.157,REMAR: Get someone at the airport.
01:12:49.157,01:12:51.534,TEDDY: He is not going anywhere.
01:12:51.534,01:12:53.703,MASTERS: What are you talking about?
01:12:55.496,01:12:58.291,TEDDY: He's watching us.
01:13:02.086,01:13:04.547,MASTERS: What do you wanna do?
01:13:12.555,01:13:17.434,"Find him, or I will bring people who can."
01:14:51.237,01:14:53.697,"If you've come for help, I can't give you any."
01:14:53.697,01:14:56.284,I understand.
01:14:56.284,01:14:58.202,Just came for tea.
01:15:04.459,01:15:06.002,"Just, uh..."
01:15:06.002,01:15:08.712,"Robert, I have very little influence these days."
01:15:08.712,01:15:11.257,I'm not at the Agency anymore.
01:15:11.257,01:15:13.426,I consult on a few things.
01:15:13.426,01:15:18.555,"Susan, I just need to know who this man is."
01:15:25.896,01:15:28.483,Who is he to you?
01:15:28.483,01:15:30.943,"That's why I'm here, trying to find out."
01:15:30.943,01:15:33.070,Tell me what's going on.
01:15:46.792,01:15:49.212,"You had a nice funeral, in case you were wondering."
01:15:51.214,01:15:56.969,"You know, when they told Susan you were dead, she couldn't comprehend it."
01:15:56.969,01:15:59.389,"She said, Oh, no. Not Robert. Uh-uh."
01:15:59.389,01:16:02.683,And not from something as trivial as a car bomb.
01:16:02.683,01:16:08.523,That you're alive is a big relief.
01:16:08.523,01:16:12.443,But it didn't come as a complete surprise to her.
01:16:12.443,01:16:23.620,"We used to talk about you over the years, and she said if anyone could have figured a way out, a way to walk away from it all for good, you know, like a real fresh start..."
01:16:24.955,01:16:27.166,it would have been...
01:16:27.166,01:16:28.543,you.
01:17:01.451,01:17:05.538,"SUSAN: You didn't take out five pimps, Robert."
01:17:05.538,01:17:09.542,You took out the East Coast hub of Vladimir Pushkin.
01:17:09.542,01:17:10.918,ROBERT: Pushkin.
01:17:10.918,01:17:18.884,"He's similar to the other oligarchs who jumped in bed with the Russian mafia, only he funds everything: gasoline, weapons, girls, you name it."
01:17:18.884,01:17:24.640,He's built an intricate network on both U.S. coasts that are incredibly well-insulated.
01:17:24.640,01:17:29.019,His money and political ties make him untouchable.
01:17:29.019,01:17:33.774,Your friend here is who Pushkin sends when he's got a problem.
01:17:33.774,01:17:37.778,Teddy Rensen.
01:17:37.778,01:17:40.156,Skill set honed in Spetsnaz.
01:17:40.156,01:17:43.033,He's formidable and smart.
01:17:43.033,01:17:45.620,Ran a wing of the secret police for years.
01:17:45.620,01:17:47.538,Went private when the Union fell.
01:17:47.538,01:17:50.874,"Basically, he's a sociopath with a business card."
01:17:50.874,01:17:52.709,ROBERT: Mm.
01:17:54.253,01:17:57.298,"Thank you, darling."
01:17:57.298,01:17:59.342,Uh...
01:17:59.342,01:18:02.886,"Boston P.D. Probably on Pushkin's payroll, I assume."
01:18:02.886,01:18:06.265,Three years. Detective Remar and Detective Pederson.
01:18:06.265,01:18:09.768,Only now they're dead.
01:18:06.265,01:18:12.522,They found them yesterday in the trunk of their car in the precinct parking lot.
01:18:12.522,01:18:16.733,Suffocated. Testicles blown off and shoved down their throats.
01:18:16.733,01:18:20.112,Classic Russian mob hit.
01:18:20.112,01:18:25.159,"Third one, Detective Masters hasn't shown up for work in several days."
01:18:25.159,01:18:27.995,"Robert, I don't have to tell you what happens next."
01:18:29.121,01:18:33.167,He won't stop until he kills you and anyone you care about.
01:18:54.813,01:18:56.982,"SUSAN: Didn't sleep a wink, did you?"
01:18:58.234,01:19:00.027,Hey.
01:19:00.027,01:19:01.862,Mm.
01:19:08.411,01:19:12.122,"Robert, that girl, Alina..."
01:19:12.122,01:19:14.041,Why?
01:19:16.793,01:19:19.422,I couldn't tell you why it mattered.
01:19:19.422,01:19:23.133,"Why what they did to her, that mattered to me so much."
01:19:24.760,01:19:29.765,One day somebody does something unspeakable to someone else to...
01:19:29.765,01:19:32.976,"someone you hardly knew, and you..."
01:19:34.228,01:19:35.979,do something about it because you can.
01:19:35.979,01:19:37.523,Mm.
01:19:37.523,01:19:40.276,Because it's who you are? Hm?
01:19:40.276,01:19:42.486,Who you've always been?
01:19:45.906,01:19:50.786,Sometimes we make the wrong choices to get to the right place.
01:19:51.870,01:19:53.497,Mm.
01:19:55.165,01:20:00.087,I know a part of you died when Vivian did.
01:20:00.087,01:20:03.215,But not the part she loved the most.
01:20:05.551,01:20:07.428,Go be him.
01:20:14.893,01:20:16.479,Yep.
01:20:18.021,01:20:20.650,Don't forget to say goodbye.
01:20:25.696,01:20:28.115,Goodbye.
01:20:33.496,01:20:36.832,BRIAN: Everything all right?
01:20:36.832,01:20:38.709,Were you able to help him?
01:20:38.709,01:20:41.712,He didn't come for help.
01:20:41.712,01:20:43.964,He came for permission.
01:22:03.627,01:22:04.961,Fuck.
01:22:18.392,01:22:20.185,What the fuck?
01:23:11.361,01:23:14.657,"Testing one, two, three, four."
01:23:17.409,01:23:20.203,Pushkin.
01:23:20.203,01:23:25.709,"I need to know everything: who, what, when, where, why."
01:23:25.709,01:23:28.796,Before you tell me you're not gonna talk...
01:23:31.214,01:23:33.759,"You can go fuck yourself, you know that?"
01:23:50.901,01:23:54.446,You're gonna give me what I need.
01:23:54.446,01:23:57.533,Or not.
01:23:57.533,01:24:01.495,"Why don't you get out of here and go fuck yourself, you fucking motherfucker?"
01:24:01.495,01:24:03.831,"You know who you're dealing with, huh?"
01:24:03.831,01:24:06.082,"I am a cop, you moron!"
01:24:06.082,01:24:13.799,"I swear to God, I'll fuck-- Okay. Open it."
01:24:15.133,01:24:20.514,Open the fucking wind-- Huh?
01:24:20.514,01:24:23.392,I'm Boston P.D.
01:24:24.810,01:24:27.062,Which means you don't have any.
01:24:27.062,01:24:30.273,"Look, you are in a lot of trouble."
01:24:30.273,01:24:33.027,Just let me go.
01:24:33.027,01:24:35.320,I'm gonna let you go.
01:24:37.031,01:24:39.449,I'm gonna let you go.
01:24:43.078,01:24:45.664,I'll be back.
01:24:47.666,01:24:50.210,Motherfucker! Wait.
01:24:50.210,01:24:51.795,Wait!
01:24:51.795,01:24:53.756,Wait!
01:24:55.925,01:24:58.134,We're here to see Andri.
01:26:13.168,01:26:16.379,"MASTERS: Hey, Andri. Listen, this location's been compromised."
01:26:16.379,01:26:19.800,Get all your shit out of here.
01:26:22.427,01:26:24.138,The fuck I'm going to do that.
01:26:24.138,01:26:27.349,And who's this fucking piece of shit?
01:26:27.349,01:26:29.935,Pushkin made the call.
01:26:31.145,01:26:33.522,Pushkin.
01:26:31.145,01:26:38.110,"Pushkin. I-- Pushkin's money. What the fuck you give a fuck, Andri, huh?"
01:26:49.204,01:26:51.957,Is that a Heckler Koch?
01:26:51.957,01:26:53.959,This?
01:26:57.420,01:26:59.464,What is he saying?
01:26:59.464,01:27:03.760,Can I see it?
01:27:03.760,01:27:06.055,"Uh, yes and no."
01:27:07.347,01:27:09.641,No.
01:27:09.641,01:27:12.978,"All right, all right, all right!"
01:27:12.978,01:27:15.689,You're so fucking nuts!
01:27:15.689,01:27:18.567,All right.
01:27:18.567,01:27:21.653,"Frank tells me you're the man, Andri. Yeah?"
01:27:21.653,01:27:24.531,He says your guys are incredibly loyal toward you.
01:27:24.531,01:27:30.162,"If you tell them to put their guns down, lay down on the floor, they'll do that, won't they?"
01:27:35.209,01:27:37.377,"Indulge me, Andri."
01:27:37.377,01:27:38.754,Tell them to lay down.
01:27:41.840,01:27:43.967,ROBERT: There you go.
01:27:43.967,01:27:47.054,There you go. Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much.
01:27:47.054,01:27:49.765,We're going out of business.
01:27:49.765,01:27:52.517,Mr. Pushkin thanks you very much. There you are.
01:27:52.517,01:27:54.310,Here you go.
01:27:54.310,01:27:57.189,Accept these parting gifts on behalf of Mr. Pushkin.
01:27:57.189,01:27:58.481,There you go.
01:27:58.481,01:28:00.609,"Three, two-- Look at that, perfect. --one."
01:28:00.609,01:28:02.652,Thank you.
01:28:02.652,01:28:04.780,Right around to the right.
01:28:07.950,01:28:09.451,Call it in.
01:28:17.333,01:28:20.045,Detective Frank Masters.
01:28:20.045,01:28:24.174,"I am 10-13 at 155 Warren Street, rear entrance."
01:28:24.174,01:28:28.845,"Repeat: Detective Frank Masters, 10-13, 155 Warren Street, rear entrance."
01:28:34.392,01:28:38.396,Anything else I can do for you?
01:28:38.396,01:28:40.899,I know you got an escape plan.
01:28:40.899,01:28:44.027,"Heh. Yeah? What's your escape plan, huh?"
01:28:44.027,01:28:47.114,Not about me. It's about you.
01:28:47.114,01:28:49.741,"Fuck you, you motherfucker."
01:28:47.114,01:28:50.909,You have fucked me so fucking bad!
01:28:50.909,01:28:52.828,You did this!
01:28:52.828,01:28:55.538,"You did it to this badge, Frank."
01:28:55.538,01:28:59.168,You disrespected this badge.
01:28:59.168,01:29:00.543,"Fuck you, you motherfucker."
01:29:00.543,01:29:03.630,"I got nothing, all right?"
01:29:03.630,01:29:05.757,I got nothing because of you!
01:29:05.757,01:29:09.052,"You think they're not coming for you, you're not fucking next?"
01:29:09.052,01:29:11.638,I am a fucking dead man!
01:29:11.638,01:29:13.932,You don't know who these people are!
01:29:13.932,01:29:17.602,I'm a fucking dead man.
01:29:17.602,01:29:19.521,Then do the right thing.
01:29:20.522,01:29:27.863,"Motherfu-- Do the right thing, Frank."
01:29:27.863,01:29:32.701,"Police officer for 22 years, I know you didn't get this far and not have an out."
01:29:32.701,01:29:36.371,Where do you keep it?
01:29:39.958,01:29:41.543,I was.
01:29:41.543,01:29:44.213,I understand.
01:29:44.213,01:29:46.131,Do the right thing.
01:29:47.174,01:29:49.259,"Do it for the good cops, Frank."
01:29:49.259,01:29:51.845,Where do you keep it?
01:29:57.475,01:30:00.436,"Just let me know when you're done, detective."
01:30:25.545,01:30:27.589,MAN 1: This guy here.
01:30:29.049,01:30:33.387,"He was cuffed to the pipes back here, 200,000 in the trunk of his car."
01:30:33.387,01:30:36.765,Recording of the whole deal with these guys on the seat.
01:30:36.765,01:30:40.476,Crazy. And that was tacked to his jacket.
01:30:40.476,01:30:42.604,That's not the best part.
01:30:42.604,01:30:44.438,MAN 2: We're on scene for the duration.
01:30:44.438,01:30:46.066,MAN 3: Get IDs on all those guys.
01:30:46.066,01:30:48.277,Check this out.
01:30:59.371,01:31:01.581,AGENT 1: Holy shit!
01:31:01.581,01:31:04.293,"AGENT 2: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
01:31:04.293,01:31:06.962,AGENT 1: Who's gonna fucking count this?
01:31:08.755,01:31:11.465,We've searched the city.
01:31:11.465,01:31:13.051,No sign of him.
01:31:13.051,01:31:15.637,McCall has disappeared.
01:31:15.637,01:31:18.848,Mr. Pushkin has been notified.
01:31:23.437,01:31:25.647,My men will find him.
01:31:25.647,01:31:27.399,Good.
01:31:29.359,01:31:31.194,I got to piss.
01:31:59.222,01:32:01.599,ROBERT: He's not coming back.
01:32:07.897,01:32:09.565,Had enough?
01:32:09.565,01:32:12.486,You certainly have my attention.
01:32:12.486,01:32:15.113,Brick by brick.
01:32:15.113,01:32:17.032,Body by body.
01:32:17.032,01:32:23.246,Or you can call your boss and tell him to shut down his operation.
01:32:23.246,01:32:24.747,Tonight.
01:32:24.747,01:32:26.458,That's not much of an offer.
01:32:26.458,01:32:28.626,Only one you're gonna get.
01:32:28.626,01:32:32.214,"When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too."
01:32:36.592,01:32:39.304,When you look at me...
01:32:39.304,01:32:40.638,what do you see?
01:32:44.017,01:32:45.852,Hm?
01:32:45.852,01:32:48.230,The answer's nothing.
01:32:48.230,01:32:50.606,I have no feelings about you one way or the other.
01:32:50.606,01:32:53.109,You're like...
01:32:53.109,01:32:56.279,Like lint or a bottle cap.
01:32:56.279,01:32:58.448,You're just a thing to remove.
01:33:00.909,01:33:03.912,I knew a Russian police captain back in the day.
01:33:03.912,01:33:05.579,He told me about a case he worked on.
01:33:05.579,01:33:07.165,Can't remember the guy's name.
01:33:07.165,01:33:10.710,"He was a famous scholar, lived in Moscow."
01:33:10.710,01:33:12.795,"He was a humanitarian, an author."
01:33:12.795,01:33:17.426,"Anyway, he decided to share his abundance with someone less fortunate."
01:33:17.426,01:33:21.637,"And even though he had five children, he opened his home to a sixth."
01:33:21.637,01:33:24.807,"An orphan, 12-year-old boy."
01:33:24.807,01:33:28.228,Kid had been pounded by the system from an early age.
01:33:28.228,01:33:29.979,Troubled.
01:33:29.979,01:33:32.606,Prone to violence.
01:33:32.606,01:33:35.651,Stop me if you know this one.
01:33:35.651,01:33:40.240,Okay. So this good man opened his home to this boy.
01:33:40.240,01:33:44.119,"And when the boy stole from him, this good man loved him anyway."
01:33:44.119,01:33:48.582,"When the boy failed in school, this man showed understanding and patience."
01:33:48.582,01:34:04.514,"When the boy lied and cheated and clawed and fought, this good man showed compassion and love until the boy, who had never felt anything like being wanted or loved, he finally did."
01:34:04.514,01:34:07.850,The man had broken through.
01:34:07.850,01:34:11.354,"One week later, intruders broke into the man's house."
01:34:11.354,01:34:15.233,Killed the man and his wife in bed.
01:34:15.233,01:34:20.196,"They said some small things were stolen, things a child might steal."
01:34:20.196,01:34:21.781,No one knows for sure.
01:34:21.781,01:34:24.534,The man's children were sent off to relatives.
01:34:24.534,01:34:27.621,"The boy, the orphan, shipped back to hell."
01:34:27.621,01:34:32.959,"Just when he finally had a chance at life, it was snatched away by two bullets."
01:34:32.959,01:34:37.671,It's a well-known story.
01:34:37.671,01:34:39.215,Did they?
01:34:39.215,01:34:41.343,Maybe they didn't look in the right place.
01:34:41.343,01:34:43.677,Sometimes the answer's in front of you.
01:34:43.677,01:34:48.724,I think the boy killed them.
01:34:48.724,01:34:50.560,I think the boy did it.
01:34:50.560,01:34:57.359,"The boy was scared his foster parents would wake up one day and realize he wasn't worth it, like all the others had."
01:34:57.359,01:35:01.737,And he couldn't bear the thought that this good man would do that to him.
01:35:01.737,01:35:08.828,Would throw him away like a piece of lint or a bottle cap.
01:35:08.828,01:35:11.498,So...
01:35:11.498,01:35:15.293,he decided not to find out.
01:35:16.336,01:35:19.422,"What do you think, Nicolai?"
01:35:22.925,01:35:24.511,You think you know me?
01:35:26.888,01:35:29.723,"You strike me as a sentimental man, Mr. McCall."
01:35:29.723,01:35:31.767,That's surprising.
01:35:31.767,01:35:33.186,I...
01:35:33.186,01:35:34.979,I don't possess that chip.
01:35:34.979,01:35:41.486,I never could understand what comes from feeling that way except weakness.
01:35:43.905,01:35:49.160,"The men I killed, your men, I gave them a chance."
01:35:49.160,01:35:51.413,They made their decision.
01:35:51.413,01:35:55.833,I'm giving you the opportunity to make yours.
01:35:55.833,01:35:58.545,Thank you.
01:35:58.545,01:36:03.299,You let me know when you decide.
01:36:03.299,01:36:04.718,Of course.
01:36:07.262,01:36:11.683,"I've done some bad things in my life, Nicolai."
01:36:11.683,01:36:14.394,Things I'm not proud of.
01:36:16.646,01:36:22.569,I promised someone that I love very much that I would never go back to being that person.
01:36:24.613,01:36:29.451,"But for you, I'm gonna make an exception."
01:36:32.912,01:36:37.166,You asked me what I saw when I looked at you.
01:36:41.170,01:36:43.881,What do you see when you look at me?
01:37:48.404,01:37:50.906,FBI.
01:37:50.906,01:37:52.659,"Agent Mosley, please."
01:37:56.788,01:37:58.164,MOSLEY: Agent Mosley.
01:37:58.164,01:38:00.542,Heard you found some money today.
01:38:00.542,01:38:02.126,Who is this?
01:38:02.126,01:38:06.088,Concerned citizen.
01:38:07.632,01:38:10.426,Make sure you're sitting down when you do.
01:39:42.727,01:39:46.147,He hit my tankers.
01:39:46.147,01:39:47.732,That you'll take care of things?
01:39:47.732,01:39:50.025,Only I've been further embarrassed.
01:39:50.025,01:39:53.362,NICOLAI: I have a new team.
01:39:53.362,01:39:55.323,You're out of time.
01:39:55.323,01:39:58.075,New York had to shut down.
01:39:58.075,01:40:00.787,My calls aren't being answered.
01:40:00.787,01:40:02.996,I've lost tens of millions today alone.
01:40:02.996,01:40:05.040,It will all be well.
01:40:05.040,01:40:07.418,Stop the bleeding or don't come back.
01:40:09.211,01:40:12.131,Go fuck yourself.
01:40:36.823,01:40:39.575,Yes?
01:40:39.575,01:40:41.410,Nicolai.
01:40:41.410,01:40:43.997,Your life for theirs.
01:40:45.289,01:40:48.501,You'll want to answer that.
01:40:49.919,01:40:52.380,Yes?
01:40:52.380,01:40:56.133,Ralphie?
01:40:56.133,01:40:59.512,Who's with you?
01:40:59.512,01:41:03.098,"What's going on? Wait-- Oh, my God."
01:41:04.475,01:41:06.602,No.
01:41:08.187,01:41:10.773,My men there will kill them in 30 minutes.
01:41:10.773,01:41:12.525,Unless you're here in 29.
01:41:12.525,01:41:14.067,You know the place.
01:41:14.067,01:41:16.905,You can still smell the burning gasoline.
01:41:38.551,01:41:40.678,He's close. Get ready.
01:41:52.523,01:41:54.817,Here comes the bus.
01:41:57.737,01:42:00.364,"Just checking on you, sentimental man."
01:42:00.364,01:42:01.741,Yeah?
01:42:01.741,01:42:03.325,You willing to die for your friends?
01:42:03.325,01:42:06.037,Are you?
01:42:08.831,01:42:11.793,"When you see him, shoot him."
01:42:14.295,01:42:16.714,The bus is empty.
01:42:24.639,01:42:26.557,Kill one.
01:42:27.809,01:42:29.518,Kill one of them.
01:42:29.518,01:42:31.270,You wanna be first?
01:42:37.860,01:42:39.737,MAN 4: Where is that coming from?
01:42:39.737,01:42:41.196,I don't know.
01:42:41.196,01:42:43.950,I don't know!
01:42:45.660,01:42:47.870,"JAY: They're gonna kill Ralphie, yo."
01:42:47.870,01:42:49.705,MARCUS: They're gonna fucking kill him.
01:42:56.629,01:42:59.423,Which way?
01:43:02.468,01:43:04.971,The song. Which way is it coming from?
01:43:04.971,01:43:07.723,The P.A. system's in the security office.
01:43:07.723,01:43:09.934,Stand! Now.
01:43:58.149,01:44:01.819,RALPHIE: Mr. McCall? What's going on?
01:44:05.656,01:44:08.325,Come here quickly!
01:44:09.952,01:44:12.080,I need your help.
01:44:42.317,01:44:45.238,Report. Where are you?
01:44:52.494,01:44:54.455,RALPHIE: Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
01:44:54.455,01:44:56.540,I-- I can't understand you.
01:44:56.540,01:44:59.127,"Okay, I'm going down."
01:44:59.127,01:45:00.753,ROBERT: Psst!
01:45:05.633,01:45:07.384,Ralphie.
01:45:07.384,01:45:10.387,Get everybody out of here.
01:45:10.387,01:45:13.182,You use the service doors in the back. Okay? Go.
01:45:26.154,01:45:29.531,Yeah?
01:45:29.531,01:45:32.743,I've decided to come and see you.
01:45:32.743,01:45:34.870,Yeah?
01:45:34.870,01:45:36.329,I'll be waiting for you.
01:45:53.055,01:45:55.766,NICOLAI: Find the hostages.
01:53:29.261,01:53:31.804,"It's me, Mr. McCall."
01:53:33.724,01:53:36.518,You said not to leave anybody behind.
01:53:38.646,01:53:39.854,"Buck-ninety, my ass."
01:54:02.835,01:54:05.005,RALPHIE: Come on.
01:54:05.005,01:54:08.342,"Aah! Oh, fuck! Unh."
01:54:20.562,01:54:22.272,You all right?
01:54:22.272,01:54:24.525,Aah. I've been shot.
01:54:24.525,01:54:27.778,Can you walk?
01:54:27.778,01:54:30.405,I'm gonna need you to do something. Look at me.
01:54:30.405,01:54:33.325,"Ralphie, focus. Focus."
01:54:33.325,01:54:35.410,Can you make it to the breaker box?
01:54:43.502,01:54:46.087,"Forty seconds, exactly."
01:54:46.087,01:54:47.422,Forty seconds exactly.
01:56:57.845,01:56:59.262,Shit.
01:57:06.812,01:57:08.229,Shit.
01:58:18.299,01:58:20.510,Who are you?!
01:59:39.673,01:59:42.634,"Shit. Oh, shit."
02:01:02.380,02:01:04.966,ROBERT: I'd stay in there if I were you.
02:01:11.305,02:01:13.058,Who are you?
02:01:15.185,02:01:16.853,Everybody wants to know.
02:01:19.480,02:01:24.444,Gun's not there.
02:01:24.444,02:01:25.737,What do you want?
02:01:27.572,02:01:29.616,I want the head of the snake.
02:01:32.368,02:01:34.246,So it's you.
02:01:36.039,02:01:38.125,And now you've come to kill me.
02:01:38.125,02:01:40.794,Yes.
02:01:43.004,02:01:47.425,"And tell me, what do you gain from my death?"
02:01:51.596,02:01:53.098,Peace.
02:01:56.268,02:01:59.104,Peace is expensive to buy.
02:01:59.104,02:02:02.732,But I can purchase it for you.
02:02:02.732,02:02:05.026,What is your price?
02:02:06.111,02:02:08.947,Are you there?
02:02:28.758,02:02:32.304,"Guards, guards!"
02:03:42.540,02:03:44.042,ALINA: Hey!
02:03:45.710,02:03:47.921,"Hey! Hey, Robert."
02:03:49.964,02:03:51.424,Hey.
02:03:51.424,02:03:55.303,"I remembered you lived around here, so I've been swinging by the last few days."
02:03:55.303,02:03:57.097,ROBERT: Yeah?
02:03:57.097,02:03:59.766,Yeah.
02:03:59.766,02:04:01.434,Night and day.
02:04:02.685,02:04:04.187,"Yeah, well..."
02:04:06.314,02:04:09.401,I get my stitches out next week.
02:04:11.236,02:04:12.862,Um...
02:04:12.862,02:04:15.656,I'm reading now.
02:04:15.656,02:04:17.409,Yeah. I know.
02:04:17.409,02:04:19.160,I got it from a used book store.
02:04:19.160,02:04:22.163,The guy there recommended it to me. It's good.
02:04:23.415,02:04:25.666,I got a job too.
02:04:25.666,02:04:27.835,A real job with real hours and stuff.
02:04:27.835,02:04:29.087,Okay.
02:04:31.965,02:04:39.097,"You know, when they gave me my stuff back at the hospital, there was this envelope with my name on it."
02:04:40.640,02:04:45.145,"Almost $10,000 inside and a ticket out of town."
02:04:46.813,02:04:48.481,"Probably hush money, right?"
02:04:48.481,02:04:50.524,Probably.
02:04:52.526,02:04:55.029,Who cares?
02:04:55.029,02:04:56.656,A new start.
02:04:56.656,02:04:58.699,Alina the singer.
02:04:58.699,02:05:02.703,Someone once told me I could be whoever I wanted to be.
02:05:02.703,02:05:05.623,"Body, mind..."
02:05:05.623,02:05:07.250,Spirit.
02:05:08.542,02:05:10.170,"I'm gonna miss your stories, Robert."
02:05:10.170,02:05:12.964,You got your own now.
02:05:15.591,02:05:17.177,Thank you.
02:05:20.263,02:05:21.639,For everything.
02:05:30.148,02:05:31.483,I'll catch you around.
02:05:32.525,02:05:33.860,Okay.
02:05:35.820,02:05:38.906,"Bye, Robert."
02:11:00.687,02:11:02.355,You're scared to say.
