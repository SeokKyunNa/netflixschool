00:00:29.321,00:00:53.804,"Please don't stop the music Please don't stop the music Now, this is exactly the type of performance you would expect to see at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella."
00:00:53.846,00:00:55.597,"Am I right, Gail?"
00:00:55.639,00:00:57.850,"John, you're so right, everything else seems wrong."
00:00:57.892,00:01:00.644,"JOHN: Boy, these Barden University Treblemakers always thrill the judges."
00:01:00.686,00:01:02.897,And the ladies in the room cannot get enough.
00:01:02.938,00:01:04.815,"So true, John."
00:01:04.857,00:01:07.526,Nothing makes a woman feel more like a girl than a man who sings like a boy.
00:01:13.532,00:01:39.516,"We're hand in hand, chest to chest And now we're face to face I wanna take you away Let's escape into the music DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it Like the way you do this Keep on rockin' to it Please don't stop the Please don't stop the Please don't stop the Chloe, look at you. You're a mess. You're unfocused."
00:01:39.558,00:01:44.063,"And your breath smells like egg. Like, all the time."
00:01:44.103,00:01:47.608,I can't believe the Bellas are being passed on to you two slut bags after we graduate.
00:01:47.649,00:01:49.526,Just don't eff up your solo.
00:01:49.568,00:01:51.194,I won't disappoint you.
00:01:51.236,00:01:54.907,"My dad always says, If you're not here to win, get the hell out of Kuwait."
00:01:54.949,00:01:56.408,Has your dad ever told you to shut up?
00:02:00.412,00:02:01.663,I'm fine.
00:02:08.545,00:02:13.008,"Please don't stop the music Ouch! Boy, that hurt."
00:02:13.050,00:02:14.843,GAIL: Sexy man-splits.
00:02:14.885,00:02:16.344,"JOHN: His pain is our gain, Gail."
00:02:32.945,00:02:33.612,"All right, good luck, guys!"
00:02:36.949,00:02:39.076,Good luck out there!
00:02:39.118,00:02:43.538,"Seriously, you girls are awesome...ly horrible."
00:02:43.580,00:02:46.166,I hate you. Kill yourselves.
00:02:49.003,00:02:51.880,"All right, ladies, it's now or never. Hands in!"
00:02:52.464,00:02:54.341,"ALL: One, two..."
00:02:56.802,00:03:00.555,"Up now, the Barden Bellas!"
00:03:00.597,00:03:06.812,"JOHN: Well, the Bellas tonight are making history as the first ever all-female group to advance to the ICCA finals."
00:03:06.854,00:03:09.148,"GAIL: That's right, John."
00:03:06.854,00:03:12.151,"Now, why do you think it's taken so long for an all-lady group to break through that a cappella glass ceiling?"
00:03:12.191,00:03:20.117,"Well, Gail, the women, typically, cannot hit the low notes, which really round out an arrangement, thrill the judges, and that can really hurt them in competition."
00:03:20.159,00:03:21.952,Women are about as good at a cappella as they are at being doctors.
00:03:27.666,00:03:29.960,"One, two, three, four."
00:03:38.927,00:03:48.520,"You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad How could a person like me care for you?"
00:03:48.562,00:03:53.067,Why do I bother When you're not the one for me?
00:03:53.108,00:03:57.696,"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh It's enough, enough?"
00:03:57.738,00:04:02.576,I saw the sign Is it me or did we just take a left turn into Snoozeville?
00:04:02.617,00:04:04.494,"Yeah, and we parked in a lot where they do not validate."
00:04:08.207,00:04:12.460,I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes I saw the...
00:04:14.838,00:04:15.964,No!
00:04:16.006,00:04:18.550,This is a surprise!
00:04:18.592,00:04:20.886,This has never happened!
00:04:18.592,00:04:24.014,"Now, this is how you bring some excitement to the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella."
00:04:24.056,00:04:26.767,She had a week's worth of lunch and lost it.
00:04:26.808,00:04:28.351,"Well, she didn't lose it."
00:04:28.393,00:04:29.186,It's all over the third row.
00:05:43.885,00:05:45.637,I got it. Thanks.
00:05:53.603,00:05:55.563,Hi there! Welcome to Barden University. What dorm?
00:05:56.564,00:05:58.566,"Baker Hall, I think."
00:05:58.608,00:06:02.612,"Okay. So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna go down this way, you're gonna take a right and you go through those double doors..."
00:06:04.198,00:06:15.209,"no more, no Your campus map."
00:06:15.250,00:06:18.086,And your official BU rape whistle.
00:06:18.128,00:06:19.087,Don't blow it unless it's actually happening.
00:06:54.915,00:06:55.999,Hey.
00:06:58.919,00:06:59.961,You must be Kimmy Jin.
00:07:02.672,00:07:03.548,No English?
00:07:05.050,00:07:06.051,Yes English?
00:07:08.095,00:07:10.055,Just tell me where you're at with English.
00:07:16.103,00:07:18.813,There he is. I'm Benji.
00:07:18.855,00:07:21.191,And you must be kidding. Wow!
00:07:23.026,00:07:25.486,"Looking at it now, I can see that it's a bit much."
00:07:25.528,00:07:27.364,I can take it down.
00:07:27.406,00:07:30.992,"No, no way. I mean, it took a second for my eyes to adjust, but I can roll with this."
00:07:31.034,00:07:33.120,"Look, just so you know, I'm not a total nerd."
00:07:33.161,00:07:36.081,I also happen to be super into close-up magic.
00:07:38.250,00:07:40.919,"Dude, that's awesome!"
00:07:40.961,00:07:42.670,How long was that little guy in there?
00:07:42.712,00:07:43.463,Several days.
00:07:57.269,00:07:59.062,"MAN: Hey, this is campus police."
00:08:02.607,00:08:04.276,Just... It's your old man making a funny.
00:08:05.693,00:08:07.279,"Chris Rock, everybody."
00:08:07.321,00:08:09.656,"Hey, you must be Beca's roommate."
00:08:09.697,00:08:11.325,"I'm Dr. Mitchell, Beca's dad."
00:08:12.700,00:08:13.785,I teach Comparative Literature here.
00:08:18.457,00:08:21.793,"So, when did you get here?"
00:08:21.835,00:08:24.379,Took a cab.
00:08:24.421,00:08:25.130,How is the stepmonster?
00:08:27.382,00:08:31.136,"She is fine, thank you for asking. She's actually in Vegas at a conference..."
00:08:31.178,00:08:33.305,"No, Dad, I don't actually care. I just wanted to say stepmonster."
00:08:36.433,00:08:38.810,"So, have you guys been out on the quad yet?"
00:08:38.852,00:08:41.313,"In the springtime, all the students study on the grass."
00:08:41.355,00:08:43.273,"I don't wanna study on the grass, Dad."
00:08:43.315,00:08:46.776,I need to move to LA and get a job at a record label and start paying my dues.
00:08:46.818,00:08:48.569,Here we go again.
00:08:46.818,00:08:51.698,"You know, Beca, DJing is not a profession, it's a hobby."
00:08:51.739,00:08:54.617,Unless you're Rick Dees or someone awesome.
00:08:54.659,00:08:58.038,That's not... I...
00:08:58.079,00:09:01.333,I wanna produce music.
00:09:01.375,00:09:04.002,But you're going to get a college education first.
00:09:04.044,00:09:06.338,"For free, I might add."
00:09:08.173,00:09:11.426,I'm going to the Activities Fair.
00:09:11.468,00:09:14.513,"Me, too. I'm going to the Activities Fair with my super-good friend, Kimmy Jin."
00:09:27.442,00:09:30.570,taking numbers. Join our righteous frat.
00:09:30.611,00:09:32.697,"If you ain't pledging Sigma Beta, you ain't worth no crap."
00:09:34.782,00:09:37.869,That's a double negative.
00:09:37.911,00:09:41.540,Follow me. There's only one group on this campus worth joining.
00:09:41.581,00:09:44.625,"As far as Barden goes, that's what being a man's all about."
00:09:50.382,00:09:58.890,Wanna see you whip it So could treat you right Give me just a minute Of your time tonight The Treblemakers.
00:09:58.932,00:10:02.477,"The rock stars of a cappella, the messiahs of Barden."
00:10:02.519,00:10:06.356,"Well, you know, not including athletes, frat guys, or actual cool people."
00:10:06.398,00:10:09.526,Organized nerd singing.
00:10:09.568,00:10:12.612,"Yeah, it makes so much sense. How's your voice?"
00:10:12.653,00:10:18.201,"We both are here to have the... So let it whip Oh, nice."
00:10:21.662,00:10:23.582,I will stop at nothing to take those ding-a-lings down.
00:10:25.625,00:10:28.378,"Hey, Barb. You gonna audition this year? We have openings."
00:10:28.420,00:10:31.839,"Now that you've puked your way to the bottom, you might actually consider me?"
00:10:31.881,00:10:35.927,I auditioned for you three times and never got in because you said my boobs look like baloney.
00:10:38.138,00:10:42.267,The word's out.
00:10:42.309,00:10:45.312,Good luck auditioning this year. Douche-b's.

00:10:52.986,00:10:55.363,"Just take the dramatics down a notch, okay?"
00:10:55.405,00:10:56.615,"Well, you're the one who got us into this hot mess."
00:10:56.656,00:10:57.991,We'll be fine.
00:10:58.032,00:11:05.790,I am confident that we will find eight super-hot girls with bikini-ready bodies who can harmonize and have perfect pitch. Okay?
00:11:05.832,00:11:08.126,"Hi, would you like to be a member of..."

00:11:16.092,00:11:18.928,What? Good singers? What?
00:11:18.970,00:11:20.430,CHLOE: Can you sing?
00:11:20.472,00:11:22.641,Can you read music?
00:11:22.681,00:11:24.559,Can you match pitch?
00:11:38.072,00:11:39.240,Yeah.
00:11:51.503,00:11:53.463,That was a really good start.
00:11:53.505,00:11:57.217,I'm the best singer in Tasmania. With teeth.
00:11:57.258,00:11:58.343,Love it.
00:11:58.385,00:12:00.011,Fat Amy.

00:12:09.270,00:12:13.191,"I will see you in auditions, Fat Amy."
00:12:16.027,00:12:24.369,"I can sing but I'm also good at modern dance, olden dance, and mermaid dancing, which is a little different."
00:12:24.411,00:12:26.371,You usually start on the ground.
00:12:27.247,00:12:28.540,AUBREY: Ooh.
00:12:28.582,00:12:30.041,It's a lot of floor work.
00:12:40.968,00:12:45.390,"Yeah, DJs. Deaf Jews."
00:12:45.432,00:12:48.017,Oh.
00:12:48.059,00:12:48.893,Shalom!
00:12:50.228,00:12:51.812,That's not a real word but keep trying.
00:12:52.606,00:12:55.024,You will get there.
00:12:55.066,00:12:56.651,Not a lot of Jewish people where you're from?
00:12:56.693,00:12:58.777,Ah...
00:12:58.819,00:13:01.698,"No. I did do Fiddler on the Roof, though, in high school."
00:13:01.740,00:13:04.743,"It was, like, me and some Aboriginals."
00:13:04.783,00:13:08.371,It was full-on Jew.
00:13:08.413,00:13:11.207,"Hey, guys. All right, I'll give you my number."
00:13:14.168,00:13:15.295,What about her?
00:13:17.297,00:13:20.467,I don't know.
00:13:20.508,00:13:22.302,"Hi, any interest in joining our a cappella group?"
00:13:24.011,00:13:27.390,"Oh, right, this is, like, a thing now."
00:13:27.432,00:13:31.102,Totes. We sing covers of songs but we do it without any instruments.
00:13:31.144,00:13:32.186,It's all from our mouths.
00:13:32.771,00:13:34.939,Yikes.
00:13:34.981,00:13:38.192,There's four groups on campus. The Bellas.
00:13:38.234,00:13:39.653,The BU Harmonics.
00:13:39.694,00:13:41.279,They sing a lot of Madonna.
00:13:42.905,00:13:45.283,The High Notes.
00:13:45.325,00:13:47.577,They're not particularly motivated.
00:13:48.411,00:13:49.496,And then there's...
00:13:55.960,00:13:56.961,"So, are you interested?"
00:13:58.338,00:13:59.339,"Sorry, it just, it's pretty lame."
00:14:00.590,00:14:03.259,A-ca-scuse me?
00:14:03.301,00:14:07.388,Synchronized lady dancing to a Mariah Carey chart topper is not lame.
00:14:07.430,00:14:09.808,We sing all over the world and we compete in national championships.
00:14:09.848,00:14:12.268,On purpose?
00:14:12.310,00:14:14.813,"We played the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, you bitch!"
00:14:14.853,00:14:16.897,CHLOE: Oh!
00:14:16.939,00:14:25.490,"What Aubrey means to say is that we are a close-knit, talented group of ladies whose dream is to return to the national finals at Lincoln Center this year."
00:14:25.532,00:14:29.285,Help us turn our dreams into a reality?
00:14:29.327,00:14:32.121,"Sorry, I don't even sing, but it was really nice to meet you guys."
00:14:36.334,00:14:39.879,What are we gonna do?
00:14:39.920,00:14:44.467,"When you came in and you were just strumming the guitar, and it was, like, totally off-key, I wanted to choke you!"
00:14:44.509,00:14:46.386,Bumper.
00:14:46.427,00:14:48.638,"Okay, I'm gonna go introduce myself."
00:14:48.680,00:14:50.097,Everybody be cool.
00:14:53.351,00:14:56.229,Hi. Hi.

00:15:01.484,00:15:03.152,Totally changed my life.
00:15:04.779,00:15:05.988,Thank you.
00:15:06.030,00:15:09.534,"And, Bumper, huge fan."
00:15:09.576,00:15:15.415,Your arrangement of Lovin' Spoonful's Do You Believe in Magic inspired me to become a certified illusionist.
00:15:16.040,00:15:18.585,Wow.
00:15:18.626,00:15:24.131,"The smell of your weird is actually affecting my vocal cords, so I'm gonna need you to scoot. Skedaddle."
00:15:24.173,00:15:27.552,"But why don't we just exchange emails, and then totally hang out right now, together?"
00:15:27.594,00:15:31.848,No. Hard pass. Hard pass.
00:15:31.890,00:15:36.227,What a nerd alert.
00:15:39.439,00:15:40.940,Too far.
00:15:40.981,00:15:43.276,Yeah.
00:15:43.317,00:15:46.237,"No, I think your trick was fine. I just think the talking was a little weird."
00:15:46.279,00:15:47.405,Maybe you can try to Facebook message him.
00:15:56.873,00:15:58.583,"Hey, I'm Beca."
00:15:58.625,00:16:00.293,Over there.
00:16:09.552,00:16:12.263,"DJ: Ninety-five point seven, WBUJ, music for the independent mind."
00:16:33.910,00:16:35.954,Hey.
00:16:35.995,00:16:38.122,Have you been standing there long?
00:16:38.164,00:16:41.292,"No. No, I just got here, I wasn't just standing here."
00:16:43.711,00:16:46.339,Freshmen aren't allowed in the booth.
00:16:46.380,00:16:48.174,I'm Luke. Station manager.

00:16:52.386,00:16:53.638,I'm Luke. You're late.
00:16:56.349,00:16:57.767,Hey. I know you.
00:16:57.809,00:16:59.226,"No, you don't."
00:16:59.268,00:17:01.270,He doesn't.
00:17:01.312,00:17:03.731,"Okay, cool. Well, you guys can figure it out while you're stacking CDs."
00:17:03.773,00:17:05.900,"When you're done, there's more."
00:17:05.942,00:17:10.864,"Now, you guys will be spending a lot of down time together, so please, just no sex on the desk."
00:17:10.905,00:17:12.072,I've been burned before.
00:17:15.242,00:17:19.413,I do know you. I sang to you. I remember because you were in a taxi.
00:17:19.455,00:17:22.082,"Wait, is your dad a taxi driver?"
00:17:22.124,00:17:22.959,Oh.
00:17:27.296,00:17:30.466,This sucks. I wanted to play music.
00:17:30.508,00:17:33.887,Not me. I'm here for one reason only. I really love stacking CDs.
00:17:36.723,00:17:38.265,"So, what's your deal?"
00:17:38.307,00:17:47.233,"You one of those girls who's all dark and mysterious, then she takes off her glasses and that amazingly scary ear spike and you realize that, you know, she was beautiful the whole time."
00:17:47.274,00:17:48.484,I don't wear glasses.
00:18:35.448,00:18:36.198,DR. MITCHELL: Beca.
00:18:37.867,00:18:39.077,"Beca, wake up."
00:18:41.788,00:18:44.582,"Funny, this doesn't look like your Intro to Philosophy class."
00:18:44.624,00:18:47.877,I'm posing an important philosophical question.
00:18:47.919,00:18:49.587,"If I don't actually go to that class, will it still suck?"
00:18:50.880,00:18:54.133,"Look, honey."
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.677,"You get to create memories here, I see it every day."
00:18:56.719,00:18:58.972,You just have to give it a chance.
00:18:59.013,00:19:01.766,"You've been here, what, a month now? Do you have any friends?"
00:19:02.850,00:19:04.435,Kimmy Jin is my friend.
00:19:06.395,00:19:09.565,"You gotta get out there, Bec."
00:19:09.607,00:19:10.775,I got a job at the radio station.
00:19:10.817,00:19:12.777,"Oh, great, that place."
00:19:12.819,00:19:16.447,"Yeah, it's dark and dirty and has like, what, those three weirdos who work there?"
00:19:16.489,00:19:18.532,"Well, four now."
00:19:18.574,00:19:22.244,"You gotta try something new, Bec. Join one club on campus."
00:19:22.286,00:19:33.213,"And if, at the end of a year, you still don't wanna be here, you still wanna go off to LA and be P. Diddy, well, then, you can quit college."
00:19:33.255,00:19:35.466,And I will help you move to LA.
00:19:35.508,00:19:37.885,Seriously?
00:19:37.927,00:19:38.886,"But I really need to see it, Beca."
00:19:39.971,00:19:43.850,This is college. Join in.
00:19:46.686,00:20:23.931,"But I can't hear a word you say Talking loud Not saying much Criticize But all your bullets ricochet You shoot me down But I get up I'm bulletproof Nothing to lose Fire away, fire away Ricochet You take your aim You can sing!"
00:20:23.973,00:20:26.350,How high does your belt go?
00:20:26.392,00:20:29.020,"Oh, my God!"
00:20:29.062,00:20:30.855,I can't concentrate on anything you're saying until you cover your junk.
00:20:30.897,00:20:32.732,Just consider it.
00:20:32.773,00:20:36.069,"One time, we sang backup for Prince."
00:20:36.110,00:20:37.862,"His butt is so tiny that I can hold it with, like, one hand."
00:20:38.738,00:20:40.781,Oops!
00:20:40.823,00:20:43.784,Seriously. I am nude.
00:20:43.826,00:20:44.535,"You were singing Titanium, right?"
00:20:46.996,00:20:49.916,You know David Guetta?
00:20:49.957,00:20:51.667,That song is my jam.
00:20:52.543,00:20:54.045,My lady-jam.
00:20:54.087,00:20:55.462,That's nice.
00:20:55.504,00:20:57.381,It is. That song really builds.
00:20:59.675,00:21:01.594,Gross.
00:21:01.635,00:21:03.721,"Dude, no. Get out!"
00:21:03.763,00:21:06.849,Not for that reason.
00:21:18.402,00:21:59.277,"Nothing to lose Fire away, fire away Ricochet You take your aim Fire away, fire away You shoot me down But I won't fall I am titanium You shoot me down But I won't fall I am titanium Oh, yeah. I'm pretty confident about all this."
00:22:00.444,00:22:01.237,You should be.
00:22:02.280,00:22:03.072,Oh!
00:22:08.077,00:22:09.287,Still need to shower.
00:22:11.122,00:22:12.206,You have a lovely voice.
00:22:12.790,00:22:14.125,Thanks.
00:22:18.462,00:22:19.964,Oh.
00:22:20.006,00:22:23.092,CHLOE: Yeah.
00:22:23.134,00:22:28.097,"TOMMY: For your audition, each of you will be singing sixteen bars of Kelly Clarkson's Since You've Been Gone."
00:22:28.139,00:22:31.851,"If a group likes you, they will contact you directly."
00:22:31.892,00:22:34.561,My tone-deaf sidekick Justin here will be collecting your information.
00:22:34.603,00:22:39.399,"If I could sing a lick, in any human way possible, I would, but I can't."
00:22:39.441,00:22:41.610,And I hate myself every day because of it!
00:22:44.030,00:22:54.665,"But if you think this is just some high school club, where you can sing and dance your way through any big social issue, or confused sexuality, you have come to the wrong place."
00:22:54.707,00:22:57.375,There is none of that here.
00:22:57.417,00:22:58.961,That's high school.
00:22:59.003,00:23:02.215,This shit is real life!
00:23:02.256,00:23:06.093,"Now, don't just bring it, sing it. And let's do this."
00:23:13.184,00:23:16.979,"Hey, Bellas, remember when you tried to play in the big leagues and you choked?"
00:23:17.021,00:23:18.856,That should really be a lesson to everyone.
00:23:18.898,00:23:23.401,"If you sing the same boring, girly shit every year, you will blow chunks."
00:23:23.443,00:23:25.154,Vomit everywhere.
00:23:25.196,00:23:27.781,My fellow a-ca-people.
00:23:27.823,00:23:35.206,"We will not let egotistical, big-headed, garbage dirtballs, whoever you may be, get in our way."
00:23:35.248,00:23:40.502,"I promise you, we will return to the ICCAs and finish what we started last year."
00:23:42.462,00:23:44.548,And here's the first one up. Good luck.
00:23:46.008,00:23:47.009,"Whenever you're ready, dude."
00:23:49.553,00:23:52.472,"Yeah, hi, my name is Cynthia Rose."
00:23:52.514,00:23:54.558,Not a dude.

00:26:40.224,00:26:41.934,"Oh, that's okay. Sing anything you want."
00:26:42.600,00:26:43.394,Uh...

00:28:07.102,00:28:08.937,"Dude, no."
00:28:10.772,00:28:14.067,"Well, well, well, look who's in treble."
00:28:15.777,00:28:17.946,"Ah, classic pun."

00:28:23.577,00:28:25.703,"Now, if you'll place your scarves in your right hand."

00:28:53.315,00:29:01.281,ALL: And I solemnly promise to never have sexual relations with a Treblemaker or may my vocal cords be ripped out by wolves.
00:29:02.908,00:29:04.577,You are all Bellas now.
00:29:08.414,00:29:10.082,We did it.
00:29:10.123,00:29:11.667,I want some more of this.
00:29:13.252,00:29:14.628,Did we?
00:29:20.217,00:29:23.220,"AUBREY: Ladies, welcome to a-ca-initiation night."
00:29:23.262,00:29:24.888,Prepare to soften the beach.
00:29:28.350,00:29:30.810,I don't know what I'm doing here.
00:29:30.852,00:29:33.564,Just living the dream.
00:29:33.606,00:29:35.441,Beca! Beca!
00:29:35.941,00:29:37.109,Wow.
00:29:37.150,00:29:39.486,Be-caw! Be-caw.
00:29:41.405,00:29:43.741,Do my eyes deceive me or are you a Barden Bella?
00:29:43.782,00:29:46.201,No.
00:29:43.782,00:29:49.496,"You're one of those a cappella girls, I'm one of those a cappella boys, and we're gonna have a-ca-children."
00:29:49.538,00:29:51.665,It's inevitable.
00:29:51.707,00:29:53.125,I don't think you're gonna remember any of this.
00:29:53.166,00:29:53.959,"No. I'm not drunk at all, you're just blurry."
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.877,You okay? Yeah?
00:29:55.919,00:29:58.004,You almost fell over?
00:29:58.046,00:29:59.465,Can you pass a sobriety test right now?
00:29:59.506,00:30:00.882,Can you stand up straight?
00:30:00.924,00:30:03.218,And I come right back.
00:30:03.260,00:30:04.344,Can I get you a drink?
00:30:04.386,00:30:06.680,It sounds great.
00:30:06.722,00:30:07.723,I'm gonna get you a drink.
00:30:07.765,00:30:10.016,I think you need to get on this level.
00:30:10.058,00:30:11.268,Please be careful.
00:30:11.310,00:30:13.353,Hi.
00:30:13.395,00:30:15.230,I am so glad that I met you.
00:30:17.065,00:30:19.693,I think that we're gonna be really fast friends.
00:30:19.735,00:30:23.029,"Yeah. Well, you saw me naked, so..."
00:30:23.071,00:30:28.452,"Yeah. Yeah, ladies."
00:30:28.494,00:30:30.996,"Come on, baby bubble, wait in line. Yep."
00:30:31.037,00:30:32.956,You want some of this.
00:30:32.998,00:30:35.250,Nice. Mmm-hmm.
00:30:36.084,00:30:37.043,Getting it.
00:30:38.295,00:30:40.839,Getting it.
00:30:40.880,00:30:43.425,"You know, so there's like 10 of us."
00:30:43.467,00:30:46.553,That means that one of us is probably a lesbian.
00:30:46.595,00:30:48.764,You think? Which one do you think it is?
00:30:48.806,00:30:51.183,My money's on Black Beauty.
00:30:51.224,00:30:55.771,"So, when I drink too much tonight, can I count on you to hold my hair back if I puke?"
00:30:57.147,00:30:58.398,Ah.
00:30:58.440,00:31:00.984,Don't tell her I said that.
00:31:01.026,00:31:03.153,All right. I'm gonna go get a drink. This ginger needs her jiggle juice.
00:31:05.071,00:31:07.491,See you later.
00:31:07.533,00:31:10.703,I thought of a new name for this hairstyle.
00:31:10.744,00:31:12.705,It's called the Orthodox Jew ponytail.
00:31:12.746,00:31:14.540,Yeah?
00:31:14.581,00:31:16.500,'Cause it's very reserved at the front...
00:31:16.542,00:31:18.502,But party in the back.
00:31:30.430,00:31:32.015,Here's the real question.
00:31:32.057,00:31:33.392,Who would be easier to sleep with?
00:31:33.433,00:31:35.644,Captain America or a great white shark?
00:31:35.686,00:31:36.770,Great white shark.
00:31:36.812,00:31:37.437,What are you turd burgers talking about?
00:31:38.980,00:31:40.649,Dressing for comfort?
00:31:40.691,00:31:45.487,You are probably the grossest human being I've ever seen.
00:31:45.529,00:31:48.615,"Well, you're no panty-dropper yourself."
00:31:48.657,00:31:53.286,So I have a feeling that we should kiss.
00:31:53.328,00:31:57.040,And is that feeling a good feeling or an incorrect feeling?
00:31:57.082,00:32:02.755,"Well, I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth, but then I think, Hmm. Better not."
00:32:02.796,00:32:14.224,"your head up And you can let your hair down You gotta keep your head up I don't know the words, but I can..."
00:32:14.266,00:32:15.350,Thank you.
00:32:17.603,00:32:18.311,This is awesome.
00:32:19.563,00:32:20.939,It's definitely something.
00:32:20.980,00:32:23.191,We are the kings of campus!
00:32:23.859,00:32:51.303,"Keep your head up And you can let your hair down But you gotta keep your head up And you can let your hair down You gotta keep your head up And you can let your hair down I know it's hard, know it's hard Man, the old Bellas was hot!"
00:32:51.344,00:32:53.764,"Yeah, they kept it tight."
00:32:53.806,00:32:56.433,AUBREY: Okay.
00:32:57.851,00:33:00.938,"As you can see, Kori is not here."
00:33:00.979,00:33:03.231,Last night she was Treble-boned.
00:33:03.273,00:33:04.983,She has been disinvited from the Bellas.
00:33:05.024,00:33:05.776,That oath was serious?
00:33:06.735,00:33:09.237,Dixie Chicks serious.
00:33:09.279,00:33:11.782,"You can fool around with whoever you want to, just not a Treble."
00:33:11.824,00:33:14.785,That's not gonna be easy. He's a hunter.
00:33:14.827,00:33:16.912,You call it a dude?
00:33:16.954,00:33:23.293,"Stacie, the Trebles don't respect us, and if we let them penetrate us, we are giving them our power."
00:33:23.335,00:33:25.545,Not a good enough reason to use the word penetrate.
00:33:25.587,00:33:29.508,"So, does anyone here have anything to confess?"
00:33:37.098,00:33:38.684,It was an accident. I...
00:33:38.725,00:33:39.643,Turn in your scarf and go.
00:33:57.076,00:33:57.828,Take your chair.
00:34:11.383,00:34:12.801,Was that necessary?
00:34:12.843,00:34:22.936,"This is war, Beca, and it is my job to make sure that my soldiers are prepped at go time with three kick-ass songs sung and choreographed to perfection."
00:34:22.978,00:34:24.938,And there are only four months until regionals.
00:34:24.980,00:34:27.649,"So, if you have a problem with the way that I run the Bellas, then you should just..."
00:34:31.695,00:34:33.488,"Don't stress, Aubrey. Relax."
00:34:33.530,00:34:34.865,We don't want a repeat of what happened last year.
00:34:38.284,00:34:38.869,last year?
00:34:39.786,00:34:40.453,What are you saying?
00:34:42.039,00:34:43.040,What happened last year?
00:34:46.209,00:34:47.920,And do you guys wanna see a dead body?
00:34:58.805,00:35:00.098,Click on Guy Pukes on Cat.
00:35:00.139,00:35:03.184,Enough! It happened.
00:35:03.226,00:35:06.646,"We will practice every day for at least two hours, seven days a week."
00:35:06.688,00:35:07.480,And I trust you will add your own cardio.
00:35:09.066,00:35:11.484,Why cardio?
00:35:11.526,00:35:13.737,"Okay, moving on."
00:35:13.779,00:35:16.907,This is a list of all of the songs that we have ever performed.
00:35:16.949,00:35:20.326,And you will notice that we only do songs made famous by women.
00:35:20.368,00:35:22.120,There's nothing from this century on here.
00:35:22.161,00:35:23.038,Because we don't stray from tradition.
00:35:25.582,00:35:30.545,"Now, this is how we will become champions."
00:35:48.480,00:35:50.983,"AUBREY: Come on, girls!"
00:35:51.024,00:35:52.985,"Go, go, go! Pick up your knees!"
00:35:53.026,00:35:55.153,"Faster, faster! One, two, one, two, one, two!"
00:35:55.194,00:35:57.990,"Knees up, knees up!"
00:35:58.865,00:36:01.994,"Yes, Chloe. Nice. Amy!"
00:36:04.037,00:36:05.622,What are you doing?
00:36:05.664,00:36:07.373,I'm doing horizontal running.
00:36:07.415,00:36:08.374,Horizontal running?
00:36:18.301,00:36:19.803,No.
00:36:21.596,00:36:23.181,"No, no."
00:36:26.101,00:36:27.102,No.
00:36:53.837,00:36:54.713,I know... I can do it.
00:37:06.558,00:37:08.101,"CHLOE: Five, six, seven, eight."
00:37:10.979,00:37:15.025,"Okay, I'm calling it."
00:37:15.067,00:37:16.693,I asked to go to the bathroom three hours ago.
00:37:18.028,00:37:22.281,Nothing. I hear nothing.
00:37:22.323,00:37:25.618,"Hey, Aubrey. Did we just learn the same choreography from that video?"
00:37:25.660,00:37:27.996,Okay. Don't forget to pick up your performance schedules.
00:37:28.038,00:37:32.125,We have a gig next week.
00:37:32.167,00:37:34.544,"You guys, it's the Sigma Beta Theta's Annual Fall Mixer."
00:37:34.586,00:37:36.713,"Okay. Hands in, Bellas."
00:37:39.507,00:37:41.093,"Hands in, a-ca-bitches!"
00:37:42.802,00:37:44.137,Sing ah on three...
00:37:46.765,00:37:50.476,"No, no, no. It's actually on three, Fat Amy."
00:37:50.518,00:37:51.394,Ah.
00:37:52.938,00:37:54.480,All right. On three.
00:37:54.522,00:37:56.357,"ALL: One, two..."
00:38:00.820,00:38:03.782,"Okay, we will work on that first thing next time."
00:38:03.823,00:38:05.408,"Okay, guys."
00:38:05.450,00:38:06.868,She has man hands.
00:38:06.910,00:38:08.203,"Beca, a word?"
00:38:09.328,00:38:11.873,What's up?
00:38:11.915,00:38:15.252,You know you'll have to take those ear monstrosities out for the Fall Mixer.
00:38:15.293,00:38:17.003,"You really don't like me, do you?"
00:38:17.045,00:38:18.838,I don't like your attitude.
00:38:18.880,00:38:20.090,I know you have a toner for Jesse.
00:38:20.799,00:38:21.967,A what?
00:38:22.008,00:38:24.261,A toner.
00:38:24.302,00:38:27.430,A musical boner.
00:38:27.472,00:38:30.892,"Yeah, that's not a thing and you're not the boss of me. So..."
00:38:30.934,00:38:33.019,You took an oath.
00:38:33.061,00:38:35.647,That oath cost you two girls already today.
00:38:35.688,00:38:36.606,I'm pretty sure you need me more than I need you.
00:38:41.402,00:38:42.279,I can see your toner through those jeans.
00:38:42.904,00:38:44.697,That's my dick.
00:38:47.826,00:38:49.327,Everything okay?
00:38:49.368,00:38:52.664,We better have our shit together for SBT.
00:38:52.705,00:38:55.708,I'm not worried.
00:38:59.045,00:39:07.720,"turn it around Turn it around, turn it around Turn it, turn it, turn it around, turn it around Turn it, turn it, turn it around, turn it around turn it, turn it, turn it around Ah!"
00:39:07.762,00:39:22.527,Turn the beat around Love to hear percussion Turn it upside down This makes my beer taste bad.
00:39:22.568,00:39:29.408,Turn the beat around Love to hear it I'm gonna stop this.
00:39:30.827,00:39:34.331,"Whoa, whoa."
00:39:37.500,00:39:40.170,"I am so sorry, Howie."
00:39:40.212,00:39:44.507,"I wanted the hot Bellas, not this barnyard explosion."
00:39:44.549,00:39:48.261,I'm not paying for this.
00:39:48.303,00:39:52.557,"Well, I hope you all remember the way you feel right now, so you will never wanna feel this way again."
00:39:52.598,00:39:56.228,"Chloe, your voice didn't sound Aguilerian at all."
00:39:56.269,00:39:58.813,"Chloe, for serious, what is wrong with you?"
00:39:58.855,00:40:00.648,I have nodes.
00:40:00.690,00:40:03.442,"What? Oh, my God."
00:40:04.319,00:40:05.570,What are nodes?
00:40:05.611,00:40:08.365,Vocal nodules.
00:40:08.406,00:40:12.577,The rubbing together of your vocal cords at above-average rates without proper lubrication.
00:40:12.618,00:40:14.871,They sit on your windpipe and they crush your dreams.
00:40:14.913,00:40:17.749,Isn't that painful?
00:40:17.790,00:40:20.459,Because I love to sing.
00:40:20.501,00:40:23.755,"Yeah, it's like when my lady doctor told me not to have sex for six weeks, and I did it anyway."
00:40:23.796,00:40:26.799,You should really listen to your doctor.
00:40:26.841,00:40:29.010,The key is early diagnosis.
00:40:30.220,00:40:32.764,I am living with nodes.
00:40:32.805,00:40:35.267,But I am a survivor.
00:40:35.308,00:40:38.103,I just have to pull back.
00:40:39.938,00:40:42.274,Because I have nodes.
00:40:42.315,00:40:43.775,"AUBREY: Chloe, this is horrible."
00:40:43.816,00:40:45.151,"Well, at least it's not herpes."
00:40:47.320,00:40:49.239,Or do you have that as well?
00:41:17.809,00:41:18.559,Hmm?
00:41:33.574,00:41:34.784,Jesse?
00:41:34.826,00:41:36.577,"I'm starving, so could you..."
00:41:36.619,00:41:37.454,You want me to get you lunch?
00:41:38.997,00:41:40.790,You should probably lay off the burgers.
00:41:40.832,00:41:41.666,"You're not gonna be 22 forever, you know."
00:41:43.793,00:41:45.920,"Yeah, I think I'm good."
00:41:45.962,00:41:47.464,He's good.
00:41:48.923,00:41:50.549,And the chess match continues.
00:41:55.221,00:41:59.934,"Hey, this is my new mix, so if there's anything you wanted to play..."
00:41:59.976,00:42:01.353,"Yeah, okay, I'll put it on the pile."
00:42:01.394,00:42:02.687,Okay.
00:42:08.276,00:42:10.069,"What's up, weirdo?"
00:42:10.111,00:42:11.404,Okay.
00:42:14.657,00:42:16.701,What's this?
00:42:14.657,00:42:18.786,As much as I love spending time with you stacking CDs...
00:42:18.828,00:42:21.789,"I love it, like, more than life."
00:42:21.831,00:42:25.210,"...I figured we could do some other fun things that don't make us wanna kill ourselves, right?"
00:42:25.251,00:42:28.629,Yeah.
00:42:28.671,00:42:34.260,"Jaws, E.T., The Breakfast Club, Star Wars and Rocky."
00:42:34.302,00:42:37.263,Best scored and soundtracked movies of all time.
00:42:37.305,00:42:40.350,That's what I wanna do when I grow up.
00:42:40.392,00:42:42.601,"Bring people to tears, you know. Blow their minds."
00:42:42.643,00:42:44.645,I feel like only music can do that.
00:42:44.687,00:42:46.647,Yeah.
00:42:46.689,00:42:48.107,You must really sweep your girlfriend off her feet.
00:42:48.149,00:42:49.317,I don't have a girlfriend.
00:42:49.359,00:42:50.818,What?
00:42:50.860,00:42:53.071,You have juice pouches and Rocky.
00:42:53.112,00:42:55.490,"Okay, so what do you wanna watch first?"
00:42:55.532,00:42:57.409,Wanna do something else?
00:42:57.450,00:42:59.452,We could relive my parents' divorce.
00:42:59.494,00:43:01.704,Or visit a gynecologist.
00:43:01.746,00:43:02.580,"What, do you not like movies or something?"
00:43:04.416,00:43:06.667,"Like, any movies? You don't..."
00:43:06.709,00:43:09.546,What the hell is wrong with you? How do you not like movies?
00:43:09.587,00:43:12.590,Not liking movies is like not liking puppies.
00:43:12.631,00:43:15.051,They're fine. I just get bored and never make it to the end.
00:43:15.093,00:43:17.762,The endings are the best part.
00:43:17.803,00:43:20.473,They're predictable.
00:43:17.803,00:43:24.519,"Like, the guy gets the girl, and that kid sees dead people and Darth Vader is Luke's father."
00:43:24.561,00:43:28.064,"Okay, right, so you just happened to guess the biggest cinematic reveal in history?"
00:43:28.106,00:43:30.525,Vader in German means father.
00:43:30.567,00:43:32.402,His name is literally Darth Father.
00:43:33.445,00:43:34.237,Huh.
00:43:35.280,00:43:36.781,"So, you know German."
00:43:36.822,00:43:39.658,"Well, now I know why you don't like fun things."
00:43:39.700,00:43:42.078,"You know, you need a movie education."
00:43:42.120,00:43:44.539,You need a movie-cation.
00:43:44.581,00:43:47.917,"Yeah, in between Bella rehearsals, which are always."
00:43:47.959,00:43:48.543,Are you guys getting ready for the riff-off?
00:43:50.462,00:43:51.421,What the hell is a riff-off?
00:43:54.924,00:43:56.217,Hit it!
00:44:00.430,00:44:02.223,Welcome to the riff-off!
00:44:05.393,00:44:06.685,Who's ready to get vocal?
00:44:09.522,00:44:10.982,JUSTIN: The winners get the greatest prize of all.
00:44:11.023,00:44:12.650,I'm taking you down.
00:44:12.691,00:44:14.235,The microphone used by Hoobastank...
00:44:14.277,00:44:15.861,...when they rocked out at the Schnee Performing Arts Center.
00:44:17.947,00:44:19.449,Let's see our first category.
00:44:26.331,00:44:27.748,Ladies of the '80s.
00:44:28.666,00:44:29.459,Oh!
00:44:36.048,00:44:42.805,"So fine you're so fine You blow my mind Hey, Mickey Hey, Mickey Oh, Mickey, you're so fine..."
00:44:42.847,00:45:03.618,"You're so fine and you're mine I'll be yours till the end of time 'Cause you made me feel Yeah, you made me feel Shiny and new Like a virgin Okay, guys."
00:45:04.910,00:45:18.466,"Touched for the very first time Like the one in me That's okay Let's see how you do it Put up your dukes, let's get down to it!"
00:45:18.508,00:45:46.703,"Hit me with your best shot Why don't you hit me with your best shot Hit me with your best shot Fire away It must have been love But it's over now But it's over right now The negative side effects of medical marijuana, folks."
00:45:47.995,00:45:50.373,Cut off!
00:45:50.415,00:45:53.459,Stoney baloney.
00:45:53.501,00:45:55.670,"So, we just pick any song that works?"
00:45:55.712,00:45:59.591,"Yeah, any song."
00:45:59.632,00:46:01.092,JUSTIN: And our next category is...
00:46:01.133,00:46:02.759,Songs about sex.
00:46:05.179,00:47:48.574,"Na na na Come on Na na na Come on, come on, come on 'Cause I may be bad But I'm perfectly good at it Sex in the air, I don't care I love the smell of it Sticks and stones May break my bones But chains and whips Excite me 'Cause I may be bad But I'm perfectly good at it Sex, baby Let's talk about you and me Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be Let's talk about sex Let's talk about sex A little bit, a little bit Let's talk about sex, baby Baby, all through the night I'll make love to you Like you want me to And I guess it's just the woman in you That brings out the man in me I know I can't help myself You're all in the world to me It feels like the first time It feels like the very first time It feels like the first time It's going down, fade to Blackstreet The homies got RB, collab' creations Bump like acne, no doubt I put it down, never slouch As long as my credit can vouch a dog couldn't catch me straight up Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves attracting honeys like a magnet Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent Still moving this flavor With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy The original rump shakers Keep going."
00:47:53.830,00:48:16.143,"Shorty get down, good Lord Baby got 'em up open all over town Strictly biz, she don't play around Cover much ground, got game by the pound Getting paid is her forte Each and every day, true player way I can't get her out of my mind Okay."
00:48:16.185,00:48:56.726,"I think about the girl all the time I like the way you work it no diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up, baby I like the way you work it No diggity I got to bag it up We out I mean, you're welcome."

00:49:03.441,00:49:06.611,The word you needed to match was it.
00:49:06.652,00:49:09.405,ALL: Cut off!
00:49:09.447,00:49:10.615,Are you serious?
00:49:11.616,00:49:14.619,"Beca, I'm sorry. You lost."
00:49:14.660,00:49:17.496,"I've never heard that rule! Ladies, ladies, come on. Come back."
00:49:18.080,00:49:19.373,Sorry.
00:49:20.332,00:49:21.667,Money in the bank.
00:49:23.711,00:49:26.881,Enjoy watching us win the ICCAs.
00:49:26.923,00:49:31.260,On the TV. On a regional cable affiliate.
00:49:31.302,00:49:34.346,"Before everybody goes to bed tonight, I need you to make a list of everything you did wrong."
00:49:34.388,00:49:37.099,I'm gonna melt that Cabbage Patch Kid.
00:49:37.141,00:49:39.310,"Hey, guys, what we just did was great, right?"
00:49:39.351,00:49:41.687,"Calm your pits, Beca."
00:49:41.729,00:49:44.607,"Yeah, but it was spontaneous."
00:49:44.649,00:49:45.399,We were actually listening to...
00:49:45.441,00:49:46.692,"Okay, everybody, hands in."
00:49:46.734,00:49:48.861,Ah on my count.
00:49:48.903,00:49:50.655,On three or after three?
00:49:50.696,00:49:52.114,After three.
00:49:52.156,00:49:53.365,That's not how we do it.
00:49:53.407,00:49:55.284,Oh! Why can't we figure this out?
00:49:59.914,00:50:04.084,songs that have the same chord progressions and create a track that blends them together.
00:50:04.126,00:50:09.298,"So, like, this is the new bass line, and this is matching up downbeats."
00:50:11.801,00:50:13.135,I'm talking really loud.
00:50:14.136,00:50:15.513,That's me singing.
00:50:28.985,00:50:30.068,"yelling, right?"
00:50:32.655,00:50:33.489,"That is amazing, Beca."
00:50:34.573,00:50:35.574,Thanks.
00:50:37.159,00:50:41.914,"So, I brought this over, because I wanna watch you watch the end of this movie."
00:50:43.624,00:50:44.792,And then I can die a hero.
00:50:49.630,00:50:50.756,"Wait, actually..."
00:50:53.091,00:50:54.552,"You have a habit of making yourself at home, did you know that?"
00:50:54.593,00:50:55.511,Yeah.
00:50:59.640,00:51:00.391,BECA: Hmm...
00:51:03.769,00:51:05.187,Okay.
00:51:06.689,00:51:09.233,The Breakfast Club. 1985.
00:51:09.274,00:51:10.860,Greatest ending to any movie ever.
00:51:12.319,00:51:15.113,This song launched Simple Minds in the US.
00:51:15.155,00:51:16.866,"Could have been a Billy Idol song, but he turned it down."
00:51:17.449,00:51:19.744,Idiot.
00:51:19.785,00:51:22.788,Perfectly sums up the movie. It's equally beautiful and sad.
00:51:25.165,00:51:26.291,That is fascinating.
00:51:26.333,00:51:28.669,Right?
00:51:28.711,00:51:31.839,"Tell me, what does Judd Nelson eat for breakfast?"
00:51:31.881,00:51:34.884,"Oh, well, like all misunderstood rebels, he feeds on hypocrisy."
00:51:34.926,00:51:36.510,Sure.
00:51:36.552,00:51:38.971,And black coffee to help with his morning dumps.
00:51:40.681,00:51:41.891,You're an idiot.
00:51:41.933,00:51:44.184,It's true. I'm full of fun facts.
00:51:44.226,00:51:46.020,You should let other people tell you they're fun.
00:51:46.062,00:51:46.729,ANDREW: And an athlete.
00:51:48.146,00:51:49.607,ALLISON: And a basket case.
00:51:49.648,00:51:51.025,CLAIRE: A princess.
00:51:51.067,00:51:53.109,BENDER: And a criminal.
00:51:53.151,00:51:54.695,BRIAN: Does that answer your question?
00:51:56.196,00:51:58.365,"Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club."
00:52:03.788,00:52:05.081,You're missing the ending.
00:52:05.121,00:52:06.040,Sorry.
00:52:17.217,00:52:19.386,It's good. I'm sure the beginning is...
00:52:22.389,00:52:23.766,The white girl is back.
00:52:28.353,00:52:29.480,And I'm out.
00:52:33.525,00:52:35.277,"Always a pleasure, Kimmy Jin."
00:52:38.489,00:52:40.491,So... Excuse me. Excuse me.
00:52:43.494,00:52:58.509,"Love to hear it Love to hear percussion Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around I should have taken that cardio tip more seriously."
00:52:58.550,00:52:59.760,How much have you done?
00:52:59.802,00:53:01.428,You just saw it.
00:53:01.470,00:53:03.430,"Chloe, you gotta be able to hit that last note."
00:53:03.472,00:53:05.349,I can't. It's impossible.
00:53:05.390,00:53:07.059,"And it's because of my, my nodes."
00:53:07.101,00:53:08.811,Her nodes. Her nodes.
00:53:08.853,00:53:10.813,"Well, if you can't do it, then someone else needs to solo."
00:53:12.106,00:53:14.025,I think Beca should take my solo.
00:53:14.066,00:53:16.568,"Yeah, Beca would be excellent."
00:53:16.610,00:53:19.571,"But also, someone else might be equally as excellent."
00:53:21.239,00:53:24.035,It's true.
00:53:21.239,00:53:26.370,And they might be shy and not wanna come forward and say they wanted a solo.
00:53:26.411,00:53:29.707,"Well, Beca doesn't want a solo, so..."
00:53:29.748,00:53:33.169,I would be happy to do it if I got to pick a new song and do an arrangement.
00:53:33.209,00:53:35.546,"Well, that's not how we run things here."
00:53:35.587,00:53:37.798,"Aubrey, maybe Beca has a point. Maybe we could try something new."
00:53:37.840,00:53:40.885,A-ca-scuse me?
00:53:40.926,00:53:43.470,You can sing Turn the Beat Around and that's the last I wanna hear of this.
00:53:45.347,00:53:47.975,That song is tired.
00:53:48.017,00:53:51.729,"If we pull samples from different genres and layer them together, we could make some..."
00:53:51.770,00:53:54.648,"Okay, let me explain something to you because you still don't seem to get it."
00:53:54.690,00:53:58.610,Our goal is to get back to the finals and these songs will get us there.
00:53:58.652,00:54:04.033,"So, excuse me if I don't take advice from some alt-girl with her mad lib beats, because she's never even been in competition."
00:54:04.075,00:54:04.992,Have I made myself clear?
00:54:05.826,00:54:07.369,Crystal. I won't solo.
00:54:08.162,00:54:09.080,Fine.
00:54:10.081,00:54:11.749,Fat Amy?
00:54:11.790,00:54:13.125,You'll solo.
00:54:14.250,00:54:17.337,Yes! Yes.
00:54:39.401,00:54:41.112,"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen."

00:54:52.539,00:54:55.126,It's a new season for a cappella.
00:54:55.167,00:55:02.258,The regionals begin the long road to Lincoln Center where all of these youngsters hope to one day win a trophy by making music with their mouths.
00:55:09.556,00:55:18.649,"F you F you very, very much A cappella out of sock puppets? Genius."
00:55:18.690,00:55:20.609,"BECA: Yeah, look at the black one with the white sock."
00:55:20.651,00:55:22.153,CYNTHIA ROSE: It's making a statement.
00:55:22.194,00:55:24.738,There's no craft there.
00:55:24.780,00:55:26.031,At least they're different.
00:55:26.073,00:55:35.207,"F you very, very much And the Sockappellas, once again proving that it doesn't get better for everyone after high school."
00:55:35.249,00:55:49.096,Please don't stay in touch Yeah Do we clap?
00:55:49.138,00:55:49.805,"No, we don't."

00:55:57.229,00:55:59.940,"Remember, ah on three."

00:56:02.026,00:56:02.609,"Wait, you said we'd..."
00:56:04.069,00:56:05.612,I'm sorry.
00:56:05.654,00:56:07.405,"It's okay, it's gonna be okay. Okay."
00:56:07.447,00:56:08.782,Let's give it up for the Barden Bellas!
00:56:12.870,00:56:15.371,Wow.
00:56:15.413,00:56:21.128,This does not look like the fresh-faced nubile Bellas that we have come to know.
00:56:21.170,00:56:24.631,Is it me or are those skirts just not working anymore?
00:56:24.673,00:56:26.508,"You're walking the line, John."
00:56:26.550,00:56:29.887,It's a nice surprise to see the Bellas mixing it up.
00:56:29.928,00:56:32.723,"It's refreshing, yet displeasing to the eye."
00:56:39.730,00:56:41.940,"One, two, three, four."
00:56:50.199,00:56:57.497,You would hardly recognize me GAIL: The Barden Bellas bringing back the same song they sang at last year's finals.
00:56:57.539,00:57:00.625,And all eyes will be on senior Aubrey Posen.
00:57:00.667,00:57:02.627,She could toss some cookies at any moment.
00:57:02.669,00:57:04.629,When you're not the one for me?
00:57:08.133,00:57:10.010,"It's enough, enough?"

00:57:54.805,00:57:57.808,"John, a change of pace could not come soon enough here for the Barden Bellas."
00:57:57.849,00:58:00.644,This is not a great way to start their season.
00:58:00.685,00:58:04.856,"Yeah, this number is like an elephant dart to the public's face."
00:58:05.690,00:58:15.492,"...eternal flame Turn it around, turn it around, turn it around Oh, yeah!"

00:59:12.174,00:59:14.176,I remember singing it with my own a cappella group.
00:59:14.218,00:59:15.593,"And what group was that, Gail?"
00:59:15.635,00:59:16.470,"The Minstrel Cycles, John."
00:59:18.180,00:59:19.806,"Well, that's an unfortunate name."

00:59:37.115,00:59:41.953,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Barden University Treblemakers."
00:59:41.995,00:59:45.457,"Here we go, the Barden Treblemakers. They're on the trail for Lincoln Center, huh?"

01:04:16.227,01:04:17.895,"I know, I know, but they were putting you in handcuffs, Bec."
01:04:17.937,01:04:19.230,It looked pretty serious.
01:04:19.272,01:04:21.149,That doesn't mean you call my dad.
01:04:21.191,01:04:22.818,"Who else was I gonna call? Okay, why are you yelling at me?"
01:04:22.900,01:04:23.985,I'm the only one here.
01:04:24.027,01:04:25.612,I didn't ask you to be.
01:04:26.946,01:04:28.448,I was just trying to help you.
01:04:28.490,01:04:29.949,"I don't need your help, you're not my boyfriend."
01:04:30.992,01:04:32.703,Got it.
01:04:32.744,01:04:34.538,"Dad, it's not a big deal."
01:04:34.579,01:04:39.584,I get a call in the middle of the night saying my daughter's been arrested for destruction of property.
01:04:39.626,01:04:42.003,It was a misunderstanding and I was protecting my friends.
01:04:42.045,01:04:45.298,I was putting myself out there. Making memories.
01:04:45.340,01:04:50.261,"If you think I'm paying for you to go to LA after a stunt like this, I'm not."
01:04:50.303,01:04:51.971,You're not even gonna hear what I have to say about this?
01:04:52.013,01:04:53.097,"No, not tonight."
01:05:05.527,01:05:06.361,ALL: Hey!
01:05:08.363,01:05:09.740,"AMY: What up, Shawshank?"
01:05:09.781,01:05:11.032,Did you get yourself a bitch?
01:05:11.074,01:05:13.159,Did they spray you with a hose?
01:05:13.201,01:05:14.369,a turn at County.
01:05:16.329,01:05:17.914,You guys waited up for me?
01:05:17.955,01:05:19.999,Of course we waited up for you.
01:05:20.041,01:05:22.627,"They've been here for hours. It's a real inconvenience, Beca."
01:05:24.713,01:05:27.298,"Beca, I'm glad you're here."
01:05:27.340,01:05:29.259,I'm calling an emergency Bella meeting.
01:05:29.300,01:05:30.761,No.
01:05:30.802,01:05:33.388,First up...
01:05:33.430,01:05:35.973,Our score sheet revealed that the Sockappellas almost beat us.
01:05:36.015,01:05:38.935,"And Fat Amy, you need to do it exactly how we rehearsed it, okay?"
01:05:38.976,01:05:40.437,No surprises.
01:05:40.478,01:05:42.939,We should be taking risks.
01:05:40.478,01:05:44.733,"It's not enough to be good, we need to put ourselves out there, be different."
01:05:44.775,01:05:47.569,Beca's right.
01:05:47.611,01:05:49.821,"The audience love the Trebles, they tolerate us."
01:05:49.863,01:05:53.533,We could change the face of a cappella if we...
01:05:53.575,01:05:54.576,"Oh, my God, that sounded so queerballs. What's happening to me?"
01:05:57.245,01:05:59.790,Let me show you this arrangement I've been working on.
01:05:59.831,01:06:00.707,CHLOE: I didn't know you were into this stuff.
01:06:00.749,01:06:01.625,Yeah.
01:06:03.960,01:06:06.797,"Okay, I have the pitch pipe, and I say that we focus on the set list as planned."
01:06:08.632,01:06:14.387,"From now on, there will be no more wasting time with work or school or boyfriends or partners."
01:06:14.429,01:06:16.180,"Sorry, Cynthia Rose."
01:06:18.057,01:06:20.226,"But Aubrey, this stuff is pretty cool. I mean..."
01:06:20.268,01:06:21.812,"Okay. Rehearsal tomorrow, 8:00 a.m. sharp."
01:06:34.407,01:06:35.450,Hey!
01:06:38.077,01:06:41.289,This is my track!
01:06:41.331,01:06:43.583,That is awesome!
01:06:43.625,01:06:45.877,You put it on the radio! That is amazing!
01:06:46.586,01:06:47.921,It's a sick beat.
01:06:50.047,01:06:52.342,"Yeah, I always thought her beats were pretty sick."
01:06:52.383,01:06:54.552,"Hey, Becky, listen, spring break, I want you to take the night shift."
01:06:54.594,01:06:57.180,Play your music.
01:06:57.221,01:07:00.934,"The DJ at the Garage does a brilliant version of this, but yours? It's better."
01:07:00.976,01:07:03.060,"Yeah, it is."
01:07:03.102,01:07:05.480,I'm gonna listen to her tonight. I think you should...
01:07:05.522,01:07:06.815,I have a thing.
01:07:07.858,01:07:09.651,Flight attendant training?
01:07:09.693,01:07:14.113,It's Barden Bellas. I have the semi-finals tonight.
01:07:14.155,01:07:17.784,Really? I did not have you pegged as an a cappella girl.
01:07:17.826,01:07:19.327,That's 'cause you don't know Becky like I do.
01:07:19.369,01:07:20.453,See you tonight.
01:07:38.513,01:07:40.765,"Okay, don't you flat-butts worry, I got this."
01:07:40.807,01:07:42.017,I'm just gonna pump and dump.
01:07:43.727,01:07:45.102,BUMPER: I don't care what you say.
01:07:45.144,01:07:48.064,"Sisqó live, best performance ever, I've ever seen."
01:07:48.105,01:07:49.148,Thong Song isn't his only hit.
01:07:53.236,01:07:54.320,All right? That's serious.
01:07:54.362,01:07:55.112,"Yo, Bump, is that Fat Amy?"
01:07:56.531,01:07:58.074,"Donald, slow down! Slow down!"
01:07:58.115,01:07:59.659,Yeah! All right!
01:08:00.785,01:08:02.787,"Hey, Amy? Sabotage!"
01:08:08.919,01:08:10.294,I've been shot.
01:08:12.422,01:08:15.299,I've just been shot! Help me.
01:08:15.341,01:08:16.426,Fat Amy!
01:08:17.468,01:08:19.220,They shot Amy!
01:08:19.262,01:08:20.722,I've got you. I've got you.
01:08:22.933,01:08:26.728,"No, no, no. I'm talking, I'm talking... I'm sitting up."
01:08:26.770,01:08:28.563,All right. Cool.
01:08:28.605,01:08:30.523,No mouth to mouth.
01:08:30.565,01:08:33.401,"Oh, shit. Bumper threw a big-ass burrito at me."
01:08:35.695,01:08:38.489,"I'm gonna kill him, I swear."
01:09:04.390,01:09:06.101,You've got yourself a little something there.
01:09:06.142,01:09:08.144,Just leave it.
01:09:20.824,01:09:30.708,I hopped off the plane at LAX With a dream and my cardigan Welcome to the land of fame excess am I gonna fit in?
01:09:30.750,01:09:50.269,"I jumped in the cab Here I am for the first time Look to my right And I see the Hollywood sign This is all so crazy Everybody seems so famous My tummy's turnin' And I'm feelin' kinda homesick Too much pressure and I'm nervous That's when the taxi man turned on the radio And the Jay-Z song was on Oh, my God."
01:09:50.311,01:10:06.369,"And the Jay-Z song was on And the Jay-Z song was on So I put my hands up They're playin' my song The butterflies fly away I'm noddin' my head like, Yeah!"
01:10:06.410,01:10:08.746,"Movin' my hips like, Yeah!"
01:10:08.788,01:10:17.505,"Got my hands up, they're playin' my song You know I'm gonna be okay Yeah! It's a party in the USA!"
01:10:18.089,01:10:20.717,Yeah!
01:10:20.758,01:10:21.718,It's a... It's...
01:10:24.220,01:10:25.429,Oh.
01:10:25.471,01:10:28.558,What the hell?
01:10:28.599,01:10:32.395,"Um... It's pretty cool, actually. I think we're just running out of gas."
01:10:32.436,01:10:34.064,"No, that can't be."
01:10:34.105,01:10:35.523,"Yeah, I did."
01:10:38.109,01:10:41.571,"And, yet, maybe I didn't, because I got hit by flying Mexican food."
01:10:47.410,01:10:48.536,AMY: And we're out.
01:10:49.620,01:10:51.164,A-ca-scuse me?
01:10:51.206,01:10:53.666,A-ca-believe it.
01:10:53.708,01:10:55.292,"AMY: Man, what are we gonna do?"
01:10:55.334,01:10:56.920,Maybe we could call...
01:10:56.961,01:11:00.297,"No, don't even say it, Chloe. How dare you?"
01:11:00.339,01:11:03.176,"Oh, no, actually that is a really good idea. I've got Bumper's number."
01:11:03.218,01:11:05.011,Why do you have Bumper's number?
01:11:05.553,01:11:06.429,Uh...
01:11:07.597,01:11:09.390,Uh...
01:11:15.605,01:11:22.612,"So, Bellas, what boring, estrogen-filled set have you prepared for us this evening?"
01:11:22.653,01:11:24.906,AMY: Excuse me?
01:11:24.948,01:11:29.285,But you guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard your man boobs are gonna concave.
01:11:32.705,01:11:33.998,"Nine miles, guys."
01:11:44.134,01:11:45.593,That's pretty good.
01:11:47.553,01:11:49.097,I set fires to feel joy.
01:11:50.473,01:11:51.766,That's adorable.
01:12:02.986,01:12:15.039,"always dancin' And it wouldn't be a bad thing But I don't get no loving And that's no lie We spent the night in Frisco At every kind of disco Five minutes, Bellas."
01:12:15.081,01:12:17.583,Where did he come from?
01:12:17.625,01:12:20.295,It's over. There's no way we can beat the Footnotes and the Trebles.
01:12:22.755,01:12:53.077,Don't blame it on the good times Blame it on the boogie Don't blame it on the sunshine Don't blame it on the moonlight Don't blame it on the good times Blame it on the boogie I just can't I just can't I just can't control my feet So blame it on the boogie Whoo! That little peanut can sing.
01:12:53.119,01:12:57.540,"He really can. It sounds to me, though, Gail, like his boys haven't dropped yet, if you know what I mean."
01:12:57.581,01:13:00.668,"If you mean his testicles, then I do, John."
01:13:00.710,01:13:03.254,"AUBREY: A-ca-huddle, now."
01:13:03.296,01:13:06.549,"The top two teams go to the finals, so we just have to beat one of them."
01:13:06.590,01:13:10.178,"And if we do it exactly how we rehearsed it, we will get there, okay? Exactly."
01:13:13.348,01:13:14.265,Hands in.
01:13:16.559,01:13:17.060,STACIE: On three or after three?
01:13:18.144,01:13:19.770,Screw it. Let's just do it.
01:13:19.812,01:13:21.522,Put your hands together for the Barden Bellas!
01:13:23.566,01:13:24.734,"JOHN: Okay, the Bellas are coming out."
01:13:27.111,01:13:29.197,Another step in this competition and...
01:13:30.740,01:13:32.449,"One, two, three, four..."
01:13:36.495,01:13:38.122,JOHN: Here we go again.
01:13:38.164,01:13:39.249,GAIL: Looks like they're sticking with what they know.
01:13:40.791,01:13:51.719,"I got a new life You would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad How could a person like me care for you?"
01:13:51.761,01:13:56.099,Why do I bother When you're not the one for me?
01:13:56.140,01:14:00.395,"Is enough, enough?"
01:14:00.436,01:14:29.048,"This time, baby I'll be bulletproof This time, maybe I'll be bulletproof I saw the sign Bulletproof Bulletproof I saw the sign JOHN: A little tension on the stage tonight."
01:14:29.090,01:14:30.716,GAIL: Claws are out.
01:14:30.758,01:14:34.845,This is just friendly collegiate fun.
01:14:34.887,01:14:38.015,"It's a tough competition, but we're all here to have a good time."
01:14:38.057,01:14:41.394,"That's right, John. But a mistake can haunt you for the rest of your life and affect your children."
01:14:48.985,01:14:51.487,"What the hell, Beca?"
01:14:51.528,01:14:52.863,Are you serious?
01:14:52.905,01:14:55.199,Newsflash. This isn't the Beca show.
01:14:55.241,01:15:00.871,"Okay, I'm sorry that I messed you up, but in case you hadn't noticed, everybody pretty much dozed off during our set."
01:15:00.913,01:15:03.916,It's not your job to decide what we do and when we do it.
01:15:03.958,01:15:06.961,Why don't you ask the rest of the group how they felt about your little improvisation?
01:15:10.214,01:15:12.758,Amy?
01:15:12.800,01:15:17.721,It was cool.
01:15:17.763,01:15:18.764,"Yeah, a lot by surprise."
01:15:19.723,01:15:22.101,A little.
01:15:22.143,01:15:24.479,I told you she wasn't a Bella.
01:15:24.520,01:15:27.148,"No, that's okay."
01:15:24.520,01:15:28.899,"You don't have to pretend you're allowed to have a say in the group, right?"
01:15:28.941,01:15:31.402,Your attitude sucks.
01:15:28.941,01:15:32.987,"You're a grade-A pain in my ass, and I know you're hooking up with Jesse."
01:15:33.029,01:15:35.448,"Whoa. Whoa. Aubrey, calm down."
01:15:35.490,01:15:39.076,Jesus Christ! That's perfect. Of course you're here right now.
01:15:39.118,01:15:42.372,"I don't need your help, okay? Can you back off?"
01:15:42.413,01:15:44.207,BENJI: Trebles.
01:15:46.959,01:15:48.336,If this is what I get for trying...
01:15:51.130,01:15:52.631,"BENJI: Beca? Beca, wait."
01:15:58.471,01:15:59.430,"Aubrey, it actually went really well."
01:15:59.472,01:16:01.015,"Chloe, stop!"
01:16:01.057,01:16:02.266,Excuse me.
01:16:03.726,01:16:06.270,"Beca? Beca, wait."
01:16:20.826,01:16:23.787,JOHN: And the Treblemakers seal the deal tonight.
01:16:23.829,01:16:31.212,"GAIL: Unfortunately, Barden's other group, the Bellas, do not advance, and senior Aubrey Posen loses her chance to redeem herself from last year's Pukegate."
01:16:40.054,01:16:41.431,KIMMY: Happy spring break.
01:16:42.181,01:16:43.099,Thanks.
01:18:09.893,01:18:13.730,"In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions."
01:18:13.772,01:18:17.234,But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain.
01:18:17.276,01:18:18.944,ANDREW: And an athlete.
01:18:18.986,01:18:20.821,ALLISON: And a basket case.
01:18:20.863,01:18:22.406,CLAIRE: A princess.
01:18:22.448,01:18:24.200,BENDER: And a criminal.
01:18:24.241,01:18:27.244,BRIAN: Does that answer your question?
01:18:27.286,01:18:29.788,"Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club."
01:18:42.092,01:18:43.344,"Oh, my God."
01:18:45.555,01:18:46.514,Okay.
01:18:57.692,01:19:01.111,We are from the Collegiate A Cappella Association.
01:19:01.153,01:19:05.074,It has come to our attention that you are not in college.
01:19:05.115,01:19:06.116,Is this your mother?
01:19:17.545,01:19:19.004,This is Aubrey Posen.
01:19:22.925,01:19:24.885,"Yes, thank you, sir."
01:19:26.721,01:19:29.181,I look forward to seeing you again at Lincoln Center.
01:19:31.808,01:19:32.685,Yes!
01:19:45.281,01:19:46.073,Ah.
01:19:46.616,01:19:47.783,Aubrey?
01:20:00.296,01:20:01.464,"I'm all in, bitches."
01:20:15.978,01:20:19.440,Okay. The a-ca-gods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance.
01:20:19.482,01:20:20.775,Shalom!
01:20:20.816,01:20:21.984,I texted Beca.
01:20:22.025,01:20:23.444,You did what?
01:20:23.486,01:20:24.820,She makes us better.
01:20:24.861,01:20:26.656,"That's not an opinion for you to have, Chloe."
01:20:26.697,01:20:28.532,Why? Because it's not yours?
01:20:28.574,01:20:29.950,"You're not always right, you know."
01:20:29.992,01:20:31.368,We will win without her.
01:20:43.464,01:20:45.132,"Jesse, I know you're in there."
01:20:46.801,01:20:48.302,"Jesse, come on. Open up."
01:20:57.812,01:21:00.439,Hey. I tried to call you. I left you a bunch of messages.
01:21:01.148,01:21:01.982,"Yeah, I got them."
01:21:03.651,01:21:04.985,I'm sorry that we fought.
01:21:05.027,01:21:07.404,I was mad and I overreacted and I'm just...
01:21:07.446,01:21:08.698,Aubrey makes me crazy.
01:21:08.739,01:21:09.615,Seriously?
01:21:11.742,01:21:12.993,You think I'm mad because you yelled at me?
01:21:14.119,01:21:15.788,"No, I know..."
01:21:15.830,01:21:18.457,"No, you don't."
01:21:20.584,01:21:23.713,You push away anyone who could possibly care about you. Why is that?
01:21:25.548,01:21:27.924,I don't know.
01:21:27.966,01:21:30.678,"Well, you better figure it out because I'm done with..."
01:21:32.012,01:21:33.347,Whatever this is.
01:21:33.389,01:21:34.515,Jesse...
01:21:52.115,01:21:53.200,Women.
01:21:53.950,01:21:54.785,Yeah.
01:21:57.413,01:21:58.706,"Okay, stop."
01:21:58.748,01:22:00.957,What is happening to us?
01:22:00.999,01:22:03.794,"Chloe, you sound like you smoke three packs a day."
01:22:03.836,01:22:06.756,"Stacie, you are so behind on choreography."
01:22:06.797,01:22:09.800,"And Jessica and Ashley, it is like you haven't been here all year long."
01:22:09.842,01:22:11.427,"Aubrey, really?"
01:22:11.468,01:22:12.928,We've literally been here the whole time.
01:22:12.969,01:22:15.806,"Aubrey, please, just give us a break."
01:22:15.848,01:22:17.641,It's kind of not the same without everyone here.
01:22:17.683,01:22:19.560,We need Beca.
01:22:19.602,01:22:21.186,Maybe if Aubrey loosened the reins a little bit.
01:22:21.228,01:22:22.312,"Okay, shut it, Chloe!"
01:22:22.354,01:22:23.773,Whoa!
01:22:23.814,01:22:26.942,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:22:26.983,01:22:29.612,"Chloe, could you please get your head out of your ass? It's not a hat."
01:22:33.240,01:22:34.283,A-ca-awkward.
01:22:35.367,01:22:36.827,Again.
01:22:40.873,01:22:44.418,"No one was more surprised than me, but I really liked those girls."
01:22:46.336,01:22:48.213,And you thought quitting was the answer?
01:22:48.255,01:22:50.466,Seriously? You can say that to me?
01:22:50.507,01:22:52.134,"Oh, come on, Bec, that's so unfair."
01:22:53.969,01:22:56.764,"Look, your mom and I, we didn't work."
01:22:56.806,01:22:59.975,But I tried so hard to make things right between us.
01:23:00.016,01:23:02.185,"But you, you just shut me out."
01:23:02.227,01:23:05.063,"Yeah, well, I shut everybody out. Don't take it personally."
01:23:05.105,01:23:06.982,It's just easier.
01:23:07.023,01:23:08.442,It's also really lonely.
01:23:15.115,01:23:16.116,What do I do?
01:23:17.367,01:23:18.452,"Well, that's up to you."
01:23:22.372,01:23:25.542,"Trebles, listen up!"
01:23:25.584,01:23:27.962,"If this is about the Bellas getting into the finals, we already know."
01:23:28.003,01:23:29.839,I don't give a crap about those dumb bitches.
01:23:29.880,01:23:32.549,Because I'm being brought up to the musical big leagues.
01:23:32.591,01:23:34.092,What are you talking about?
01:23:34.134,01:23:45.187,"John Mayer just asked me, personally, through an assistant, to sing backup on his I leave for Los Angeles in a few hours, so I gotta get going."
01:23:45.228,01:23:47.815,"But Bumper, what about the ICCAs?"
01:23:47.857,01:23:53.111,"Hmm. Sorry, buddies, but I won that shit like 100 times, so I'm out of here."
01:23:53.153,01:23:55.614,Got a collarless leather jacket to buy.
01:23:55.656,01:23:57.574,"I might get an earring, I don't know."
01:23:57.616,01:24:00.076,It's Los Angeles.
01:24:01.787,01:24:04.623,Bumper's a jerk.
01:24:04.665,01:24:06.249,"Well, he's a jerk that we need to replace."
01:24:06.291,01:24:08.210,DONALD: Pronto dente.
01:24:08.251,01:24:09.670,You know he writes his own fan mail.
01:24:15.759,01:24:18.762,"Spot opened up, and it's yours if you want it."
01:24:18.804,01:24:22.265,Just one condition.
01:24:22.307,01:24:25.895,"We're just a group of guys singing a bunch of covers of songs, okay?"
01:24:25.936,01:24:28.689,"If you get weird, they will definitely not let you stay."
01:24:28.731,01:24:31.274,Deal. Although I don't know what you mean by weird.
01:24:32.943,01:24:35.278,Got it.
01:24:35.320,01:24:38.032,"I have been there for you for so many years, and all you do is treat me like..."
01:24:38.073,01:24:41.660,"All right, no, okay, just shut up! Everyone!"
01:24:41.702,01:24:44.955,"Come on, I joined this group so I could hang out with a bunch of really cool chicks."
01:24:44.997,01:24:49.209,And also 'cause I was really sick of all my boyfriends and I need to get away from that.
01:24:49.251,01:24:51.587,But this is some serious horseshit.
01:24:53.171,01:24:56.174,What's that smell?
01:24:56.216,01:24:58.594,I don't wanna be like the old Bellas.
01:24:58.635,01:25:00.429,"Yeah, I wanna be how we are now."
01:25:03.807,01:25:05.100,We should have listened to Beca.
01:25:05.141,01:25:07.019,"Oh, so it's my fault?"
01:25:07.061,01:25:08.437,That's not what I'm saying.
01:25:08.478,01:25:10.731,"No, no, no, that's what you're all thinking, isn't it?"
01:25:10.773,01:25:14.735,That I'm the jerk.
01:25:14.777,01:25:18.363,"Aubrey, you're too controlling and it's gonna ruin all of us."
01:25:18.405,01:25:21.408,"You know what, I can lose control if I want to."
01:25:21.450,01:25:24.661,I can let go.
01:25:25.203,01:25:26.038,Hmm?
01:25:35.756,01:25:38.258,"Come on, bring it!"
01:25:38.300,01:25:39.593,That's all you got?
01:25:39.635,01:25:41.804,Enough! Enough!
01:25:46.224,01:25:47.142,We could have been champions!
01:25:50.312,01:25:51.354,"Give me the pitch pipe, you bitch!"
01:25:52.188,01:25:53.732,Give it to me!
01:25:55.150,01:25:57.736,Give it to me!
01:25:57.778,01:25:59.237,Never!
01:25:59.279,01:26:00.572,I'll protect you.
01:26:00.614,01:26:01.615,Hands off the goodies!
01:26:16.839,01:26:18.298,"Move, you bitches!"
01:26:25.681,01:26:26.515,Guys!
01:26:28.142,01:26:29.476,"Guys, stop!"
01:26:37.985,01:26:41.196,Nothing. Nothing.
01:26:41.237,01:26:46.827,I know. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
01:26:49.621,01:26:55.377,What I did was a really dick move and I shouldn't have changed the set without asking you guys.
01:26:55.418,01:26:56.170,And I definitely shouldn't have left.
01:26:58.964,01:27:00.090,I let you guys down and I'm really sorry.
01:27:03.259,01:27:04.094,And...
01:27:07.305,01:27:09.141,"Aubrey, if you would have me, I want back in."
01:27:44.718,01:27:46.386,Wait.
01:27:46.428,01:27:47.470,Thank you.
01:27:49.472,01:27:52.184,"Beca, I know that I've been hard on you, okay?"
01:27:54.228,01:27:56.813,I know that I have been hard on everyone here.
01:27:59.191,01:28:00.776,But I am my father's daughter.
01:28:04.113,01:28:11.411,"And he always said, If at first you don't succeed, pack your bags."
01:28:15.958,01:28:17.000,Jesus.
01:28:19.294,01:28:22.089,"I get it. Mine gets on me, too."
01:28:22.131,01:28:23.590,"Not like that, but..."
01:28:26.551,01:28:27.261,I guess we don't really know that much about each other.
01:28:28.637,01:28:31.932,"About most of you, really."
01:28:31.974,01:28:35.310,"Well, I'll confess something that none of you know about me."
01:28:36.895,01:28:38.272,I have a lot of sex.
01:28:38.313,01:28:39.273,"Yeah, we know, Stacie."
01:28:40.899,01:28:42.192,Only 'cause I just told you.
01:28:42.234,01:28:44.153,This is a good idea.
01:28:44.194,01:28:46.696,"That was a pretty bad example, but this is a good idea."
01:28:46.738,01:28:55.455,"Why don't we all go around the room, and we can all say something about ourselves that nobody else knows."
01:28:56.456,01:28:59.209,"Okay, I got something."
01:28:59.251,01:29:02.378,This is hard for me to admit to you guys.
01:29:02.420,01:29:05.257,I think we all know where this is going. Let's be honest.
01:29:07.467,01:29:14.308,"Well, for the last two years, I've had a serious gambling problem."
01:29:14.349,01:29:15.934,What?
01:29:15.976,01:29:17.936,It started when I broke up with my girlfriend.
01:29:23.692,01:29:24.651,I still love you.
01:29:29.990,01:29:31.158,BECA: Anyone else?
01:29:35.162,01:29:36.121,my twin in the womb.
01:29:38.207,01:29:39.124,What?
01:29:42.669,01:29:43.503,Okay.
01:29:45.714,01:29:46.589,Fat Amy?
01:29:47.507,01:29:49.676,I'm an open book.
01:29:49.718,01:29:51.427,"I mean, for God's sake, you guys all call me Fat Amy."
01:29:53.805,01:29:57.642,"See, I guess I'm just not really living if I'm not being 100% honest."
01:30:01.563,01:30:03.232,And my real name is Fat Patricia.
01:30:04.733,01:30:05.775,WOMAN: What?
01:30:07.861,01:30:15.535,Okay. I've never been one of those girls who had a lot of friends who were girls. And I do now.
01:30:17.537,01:30:18.872,And that's pretty cool.
01:30:22.625,01:30:24.460,"So, that's me."
01:30:26.922,01:30:27.714,Okay.
01:30:31.385,01:30:36.430,"Over spring break, I made the courageous decision to remove my nodes."
01:30:38.516,01:30:46.233,"I know. The doctor said that I can't sing above a G-sharp, maybe ever."
01:30:46.275,01:30:48.735,the season was over.
01:30:53.031,01:30:54.908,It's okay. It's okay.
01:30:57.619,01:31:00.247,"Beca, what do we do?"
01:31:10.173,01:31:11.300,I'm sorry.
01:31:12.384,01:31:13.218,Maybe not here.
01:31:15.011,01:31:17.139,All right. Let's remix this business.
01:31:18.723,01:31:23.353,"Aubrey, would you pick a song for us, please?"
01:31:23.395,01:31:25.314,"Bruno Mars, Just The Way You Are."
01:31:27.732,01:31:30.319,"Okay. Chloe, are you okay to take the lead?"
01:31:30.360,01:31:31.278,Yeah.
01:31:57.679,01:32:27.250,"her eyes Make the stars look like they're not shinin' Her hair, her hair Falls perfectly without her trying She's so beautiful And I tell her every day I was thinking 'bout her, thinkin' 'bout me Thinkin' 'bout us, what we gonna be Opened my eyes, it was only just a dream She don't see what I see But every time she asks me, Do I look okay?"
01:32:27.292,01:32:36.676,It was only just a dream When I see your face So I traveled back down that road Will she come back?
01:32:34.174,01:32:53.985,No one knows I realize it was only just a dream There's not a thing that I would change 'Cause you're amazing Just the way you are It was only just a dream When I see your face So I traveled back down that road Will she come back?
01:32:51.941,01:33:17.050,No one knows I realize it was only just a dream There's not a thing that I would change 'Cause you're amazing Just the way you are It was only just a dream When I see your face Face Hands in.
01:33:21.346,01:33:23.848,"ALL: One, two..."
01:33:25.183,01:33:27.060,What was that?
01:33:27.102,01:33:28.937,"I don't know, I've never made that sound before."
01:33:28.978,01:33:31.605,"Yo, but with your messed up vocal cords, you could hit the bass notes."
01:33:31.647,01:33:33.275,Do you know what that means?
01:33:33.316,01:33:35.068,"Yes, Lilly?"
01:33:35.110,01:33:36.403,I think I have something that can help us out.
01:33:38.321,01:33:40.240,"Excuse me, bitch, you don't need to shout."
01:33:40.282,01:33:41.866,"Okay, don't get mouthy."
