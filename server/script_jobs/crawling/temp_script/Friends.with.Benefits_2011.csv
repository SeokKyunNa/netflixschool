00:00:22.857,00:00:27.361,That kind of freaks me out.
00:00:27.402,00:00:29.822,"That's done. Okay, we could start with this."
00:00:29.864,00:00:32.867,"I know it's a hard-hitting piece, but come on, you guys, it's the Internet."
00:00:32.908,00:00:35.118,"We need traffic, traffic, traffic. What do you got?"
00:00:35.160,00:00:37.872,How about this?
00:00:37.913,00:00:40.415,"Now, doesn't she look smart and knowledgeable about immigration reform?"
00:00:40.457,00:00:42.417,ALL: Yeah.
00:00:42.459,00:00:44.879,I'm fucking with you people. This isn't a porn site.
00:00:44.920,00:00:47.130,"What are we, nerds trying to look at boobies?"
00:00:47.172,00:00:48.966,"Come on, keep looking."
00:00:49.008,00:00:51.050,Shit! Hello?
00:00:51.092,00:00:53.554,"Hey! Baby, where are you?"
00:00:53.595,00:00:54.930,No! Not even close.
00:00:54.972,00:00:56.473,"Just so you know, the movie starts in 10 minutes."
00:00:56.515,00:00:58.350,I know!
00:00:58.392,00:01:00.101,I'll buy you lunch tomorrow. Come on.
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.354,I'm your boss.
00:01:02.396,00:01:04.523,Please try not to be late. I really hate missing the beginning.
00:01:04.565,00:01:05.649,I know. I know.
00:01:07.860,00:01:09.069,Give me your pants.
00:01:10.237,00:01:11.655,I'm almost there!
00:01:11.697,00:01:13.615,How far away?
00:01:15.242,00:01:17.912,Where are you?
00:01:17.953,00:01:19.371,So many people.
00:01:19.413,00:01:25.084,"I'm wearing the only clothes outside the theater, because I'm the only person outside the theater!"
00:01:25.126,00:01:27.004,I love that outfit.
00:01:27.046,00:01:28.756,You know that I love this movie.
00:01:28.797,00:01:34.803,"If a prostitute and a ruthless businessman can fall in love, then anyone can."
00:01:34.845,00:01:36.764,"I know this means a lot to you, which means it means a lot to me."
00:01:36.805,00:01:38.223,"Well, apparently it doesn't."
00:01:38.265,00:01:39.600,I'm looking at you right now. I can see you!
00:01:39.641,00:01:40.893,MAN: Jamie!
00:01:41.476,00:01:42.561,Hey!
00:01:43.854,00:01:44.980,Hey.
00:01:45.022,00:01:47.106,Yeah. Hey.
00:01:47.148,00:01:49.568,Sorry I'm late.
00:01:49.610,00:01:52.071,"I got you turkey, no cheese, gluten-free bread."
00:01:52.112,00:01:54.448,You sure this was prepared in a nut-free facility?
00:01:54.489,00:01:56.408,"Yes, I'm fully aware of your allergies."
00:01:56.450,00:02:00.454,"Hey, I'm here!"
00:02:00.495,00:02:02.289,We missed Your Body Is a Wonderland.
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.374,Okay. Only one song.
00:02:04.416,00:02:05.918,It was fucking Your Body Is a Wonderland!
00:02:05.960,00:02:09.964,"Well, the good news is, he has so many good ones."
00:02:10.005,00:02:13.801,"Here's an idea. Next time, instead of being late, just shit on my face."
00:02:13.842,00:02:16.261,'Cause that's kind of the same thing as missing Your Body Is a Wonderland.
00:02:16.303,00:02:17.554,"Okay, come on."
00:02:17.596,00:02:19.681,Julia Roberts is about to put on her really tall boots.
00:02:19.723,00:02:20.975,Um...
00:02:21.642,00:02:22.768,We need to talk.
00:02:27.106,00:02:28.523,I think we should take a break.
00:02:28.565,00:02:30.734,"I just feel like we should chill for a while, you know?"
00:02:30.776,00:02:32.486,You're doing this?
00:02:32.527,00:02:33.904,You said I was your soul mate.
00:02:33.946,00:02:35.530,I did? When?
00:02:35.572,00:02:37.992,When we were at that bed and breakfast having sex.
00:02:38.033,00:02:39.451,"But, you know, that doesn't..."
00:02:39.493,00:02:40.744,Count.
00:02:40.786,00:02:42.788,I was tied up at work. I'm sorry.
00:02:42.830,00:02:47.668,Maybe you should care a little bit less about work and a little more about the girl that you're dating.
00:02:47.709,00:02:53.507,"'Cause last time I checked, work doesn't reassure you that liking a finger up your ass doesn't make you gay."
00:02:53.548,00:02:56.635,I never said Go up. Okay?
00:02:56.677,00:03:00.014,I just said lightly around... It's like a little button.
00:03:00.055,00:03:02.016,You know what?
00:03:02.057,00:03:03.391,Is this why you were late?
00:03:03.433,00:03:04.810,You were worried about how to break up with me?
00:03:04.852,00:03:07.395,"Oh, no, no."
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.690,"So, you went with sneakers and a hoodie."
00:03:09.731,00:03:11.525,"What, are you gonna take the SATs after this?"
00:03:11.566,00:03:13.401,"Don't lash out, okay?"
00:03:13.443,00:03:15.236,You're better than that.
00:03:15.278,00:03:17.072,I just think we're heading in different directions.
00:03:17.114,00:03:19.658,"Yeah, you to the John Mayer concert and me not."
00:03:19.700,00:03:22.077,"Thank you for doing this before the concert, by the way."
00:03:22.119,00:03:26.289,Best breakup He is the Sheryl Crow of our generation!
00:03:26.331,00:03:27.791,Let me just ask you a quick question.
00:03:27.833,00:03:31.920,And just know that I am not at all crushed by this breakup.
00:03:31.962,00:03:33.881,"So, be honest. Why?"
00:03:33.922,00:03:35.132,"Wait, is this a trick?"
00:03:35.174,00:03:37.258,Just pure anthropological research.
00:03:37.300,00:03:43.682,"Okay. You want someone to sweep you off your feet, but you're more interested in getting swept off your feet than the someone who's doing the sweeping."
00:03:43.724,00:03:47.936,"You seem like you've got it totally together, but you're actually really emotionally damaged."
00:03:47.978,00:03:51.065,"Also, you have, like, really big eyes, and that freaks me out sometimes..."
00:03:51.106,00:03:53.316,Thank you.
00:03:53.358,00:03:55.069,It is not you at all.
00:03:55.110,00:03:58.405,Of course it's me!
00:03:58.446,00:04:01.241,It's not. It's me.
00:04:01.282,00:04:03.618,This is my fault.
00:04:03.660,00:04:04.995,You're a great guy.
00:04:05.037,00:04:08.207,"A little too emotionally unavailable, if you ask me."
00:04:08.248,00:04:09.332,I didn't.
00:04:09.374,00:04:10.834,I really want to stay friends.
00:04:10.876,00:04:12.419,Let's stay friends.
00:04:12.460,00:04:13.294,Totally.
00:04:15.672,00:04:16.464,John Mayer.
00:04:17.465,00:04:18.884,John fucking Mayer!
00:04:19.718,00:04:20.802,"Come here, you."
00:04:21.845,00:04:23.388,You're gonna get through this.
00:04:26.349,00:04:31.188,Why do relationships always start off so fun and then turn into suck-a-bag-o-dicks?
00:04:31.230,00:04:35.067,I really have to stop buying into this bullshit Hollywood cliche of true love.
00:04:36.359,00:04:39.238,"Shut up, Katherine Heigl! You stupid liar!"
00:04:39.279,00:04:42.449,I'm just gonna work and fuck. Like George Clooney.
00:04:42.490,00:04:45.077,I'm just gonna shut myself down emotionally.
00:04:46.870,00:04:48.288,Like George Clooney.
00:04:57.881,00:04:59.424,Hello.
00:04:59.466,00:05:00.425,"Seat up, please, sir."
00:05:01.384,00:05:03.011,Is that the Hudson River?
00:05:03.053,00:05:05.764,No. It's the East River.
00:05:05.806,00:05:12.562,"So we won't be landing on it, then, like that flight, you know, with that captain they keep giving medals to?"
00:05:14.064,00:05:15.315,That pilot was a hero.
00:05:17.776,00:05:18.860,Asshole.
00:05:20.612,00:05:23.698,Plane actually did a lot of the work.
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.785,JAMIE: I think I found the perfect guy to fill that job at GQ.
00:05:26.827,00:05:29.163,"No, he's landing early."
00:05:29.204,00:05:32.207,"No, he's not sold on the job yet, but I'll get him there. I always do."
00:05:32.249,00:05:34.668,I'm even picking him up in a hybrid.
00:05:34.709,00:05:37.545,He's from LA. I figured he's into all that bullshit.
00:05:37.587,00:05:39.338,"Hey, sir, what's that tall building over there?"
00:05:40.215,00:05:41.382,Empire State Building.
00:05:41.424,00:05:43.135,"No, no, no, no."
00:05:43.177,00:05:46.972,"The really, really tall one with the antenna on top of it, the windows."
00:05:47.014,00:05:48.347,That is Empire State Building.
00:05:49.348,00:05:51.018,"Oh, yeah. You're right. King Kong."
00:05:51.059,00:05:52.186,Hey...
00:05:56.815,00:05:59.609,"Oh, hey! Are you done with this?"
00:05:59.651,00:06:02.112,"Great. Welcome to New York, Ms. Penderghast."
00:06:02.612,00:06:03.571,Yeah.
00:06:14.249,00:06:17.627,"Oh, no. Oh."
00:06:17.669,00:06:18.712,Okay.
00:06:23.258,00:06:25.344,Can you hand me my bag?
00:06:25.384,00:06:26.553,The one with the straps.
00:06:26.594,00:06:27.428,MAN: There.
00:06:28.055,00:06:29.388,Okay.
00:06:30.431,00:06:32.391,Thank you.
00:06:36.021,00:06:37.438,Excuse me.
00:06:38.857,00:06:41.109,That's me.
00:06:41.151,00:06:43.737,"No. The makeshift sign made out of lipstick, that's me."
00:06:44.779,00:06:46.740,You're Dylan Harper.
00:06:46.781,00:06:48.116,I'm Jamie Rellis.
00:06:48.158,00:06:50.451,You're picking me up from the airport.
00:06:51.828,00:06:53.247,You always pick people up like this?
00:06:53.288,00:06:55.332,"Uh, yeah, you know, I like to keep things interesting."
00:06:55.374,00:06:57.918,Welcome to New York.
00:06:57.959,00:07:00.628,You're not exactly what comes to mind when you think headhunter.
00:07:00.670,00:07:03.840,"Yeah, I prefer executive recruiter. Headhunter sounds a little creepy."
00:07:03.882,00:07:06.467,You did stalk me for six months.
00:07:06.509,00:07:08.803,"Oh, here, here, here, I'll take it."
00:07:08.845,00:07:11.306,You're really gonna carry my bag?
00:07:11.348,00:07:14.101,No. I'm gonna change your life.
00:07:15.352,00:07:17.187,My life is already pretty great.
00:07:17.229,00:07:20.523,"Oh, really? 'Cause you wouldn't be here if your life were already pretty great."
00:07:20.565,00:07:23.151,A free trip to New York.
00:07:23.193,00:07:25.987,"Well, then I guess you must have been an idiot for the past six months."
00:07:26.029,00:07:29.324,"Ooh, yeah, a lot of people would say longer than that."
00:07:29.366,00:07:31.243,"JAMIE: It's a huge opportunity, Dylan."
00:07:31.285,00:07:34.704,Art director of GQ magazine. This is the big leagues.
00:07:34.746,00:07:36.456,"I mean, no offense to your little blog on the Internet."
00:07:36.497,00:07:38.708,Which got six million hits last month.
00:07:38.750,00:07:43.171,I could put up a video of me mixing cake batter with my boobs and it will get eight million hits.
00:07:43.213,00:07:46.007,It's been done.
00:07:46.591,00:07:48.468,Really?
00:07:48.509,00:07:53.223,"Well, look, there's no question that you are talented at what you do, but this is GQ."
00:07:53.265,00:07:54.724,New York's so crowded.
00:07:55.934,00:07:58.145,Look around.
00:07:58.186,00:08:01.689,I like my open spaces.
00:08:01.731,00:08:03.483,"Come on, what's really worrying you about this?"
00:08:05.902,00:08:13.118,I don't know. I don't want to be the guy who took something legendary and shit the bed with it. Excuse the expression.
00:08:13.160,00:08:16.246,"Well, then don't be the guy who shit the bed. Excuse the expression."
00:08:16.288,00:08:20.292,Be the guy who made the bed legendary again.
00:08:20.334,00:08:23.503,"Listen, we'll get some coffee in you before the interview. You'll be fine."
00:08:23.544,00:08:28.175,"I'm sorry, not coffee."
00:08:29.384,00:08:30.718,DYLAN: Really hot in New York.
00:08:30.760,00:08:32.179,Doesn't it get hot in LA?
00:08:32.220,00:08:34.139,"Yeah, it gets hot in LA, but it's the humidity."
00:08:34.181,00:08:37.100,"In LA, if it's 90 degrees, it feels like 90 degrees. But..."
00:08:37.142,00:08:38.559,Right.
00:08:37.142,00:08:40.603,"If it's hot in New York, it's 90 degrees, it's like 100,000 degrees."
00:08:40.645,00:08:44.399,"This conversation about weather is really fascinating, but lucky for me, we are here."
00:08:45.984,00:08:48.028,"So, good luck."
00:08:48.069,00:08:51.990,"Whatever happens, happens. I told you, I don't really want it."
00:08:52.032,00:08:54.909,Just do me a favor?
00:08:54.951,00:08:57.287,I... I can do that.
00:08:57.329,00:08:58.538,"This is great, by the way."
00:09:08.548,00:09:10.008,Watch it!
00:09:20.310,00:09:22.603,Hey!
00:09:22.645,00:09:24.856,"Uh, yeah. Well, it's my job."
00:09:24.898,00:09:26.233,Nice.
00:09:26.274,00:09:29.777,"So, tell me, how'd it go?"
00:09:29.819,00:09:31.696,They bought it.
00:09:31.738,00:09:34.157,"Well, thank you."
00:09:38.370,00:09:39.913,"Uh, this is from you."
00:09:39.954,00:09:41.331,It's your offer.
00:09:41.373,00:09:43.583,"Wait, I... I got it?"
00:09:44.792,00:09:48.922,Congratulations. Offer expires at midnight.
00:09:48.963,00:09:50.757,Why didn't you just tell me instead of texting me?
00:09:50.798,00:09:51.966,'Cause it's more dramatic.
00:09:54.802,00:09:56.971,"Dylan, you are not gonna shit the bed."
00:09:57.013,00:09:58.723,I've seen your work.
00:09:59.558,00:10:01.017,It's a huge move.
00:10:01.059,00:10:03.311,Would you uproot your entire life for a job?
00:10:03.353,00:10:05.564,"Well, no. For a job, probably not."
00:10:05.646,00:10:09.692,But for New York?
00:10:09.734,00:10:13.363,"Which is why I'm not gonna try to sell you on the job, I'm gonna sell you on New York."
00:10:13.405,00:10:14.948,It's New York!
00:10:14.989,00:10:16.157,I've seen Seinfeld.
00:10:16.199,00:10:18.076,Not the bullshit tourist version.
00:10:20.703,00:10:22.414,Puppy dog eyes.
00:10:22.456,00:10:24.207,Yes! Come on.
00:10:24.249,00:10:25.417,Let me buy you a drink.
00:10:29.045,00:10:30.589,What's wrong?
00:10:30.630,00:10:32.173,What... What are you waiting for?
00:10:32.215,00:10:33.383,The light to change.
00:10:33.425,00:10:34.801,You LA folk are so cute.
00:10:35.176,00:10:36.470,Come on.
00:10:36.511,00:10:37.637,"Come on, it's fine."
00:10:37.678,00:10:38.805,See?
00:10:38.846,00:10:40.014,I'm gonna die.
00:10:40.056,00:10:47.230,"Here we have Brooklyn Bridge, downtown Manhattan, and right in front of us, an outdoor bar."
00:10:47.272,00:10:48.773,Aha!
00:10:48.815,00:10:50.858,Alcohol. Now we're talking.
00:10:54.362,00:10:56.281,"You know, I like you."
00:10:56.323,00:10:57.491,I'll give you your choice of closes.
00:10:58.699,00:11:01.035,What?
00:11:01.077,00:11:03.746,Okay.
00:11:03.788,00:11:07.459,"Dylan, you are so good at what you do."
00:11:07.501,00:11:09.252,The take-it-or- leave-it close.
00:11:09.294,00:11:11.879,"Man, I don't care if you take it."
00:11:11.921,00:11:13.590,The sympathy close.
00:11:13.632,00:11:15.258,"You see, my kidneys are failing..."
00:11:15.300,00:11:18.970,Why do women think the only way to get a man to do what they want is to manipulate him?
00:11:19.012,00:11:23.682,History. Personal experience.
00:11:23.724,00:11:26.269,"Come on, you're here for a reason, whether you want to admit it or not."
00:11:26.311,00:11:29.564,"Yeah, to explore an option. Who wouldn't want to know their options?"
00:11:29.606,00:11:31.107,Someone who's in the perfect situation.
00:11:31.149,00:11:32.192,Are you in the perfect situation?
00:11:32.233,00:11:34.653,Job? Absolutely.
00:11:34.693,00:11:36.695,Everything else?
00:11:40.950,00:11:42.202,Shaun!
00:11:42.243,00:11:43.662,Jamie!
00:11:43.702,00:11:45.288,"Hey, what's up, baby?"
00:11:45.330,00:11:46.623,You look great.
00:11:46.665,00:11:48.625,"You been, uh, working out?"
00:11:48.667,00:11:50.001,"Ah, okay."
00:11:50.043,00:11:51.294,Do you want a drink?
00:11:51.336,00:11:52.420,Let me get you a drink. Yeah?
00:11:52.462,00:11:54.964,Careful! Careful.
00:11:55.006,00:11:58.009,"Hey, bro, that was like a double McTwist 1260."
00:11:59.594,00:12:01.971,"Yeah, like the trick."
00:12:02.013,00:12:04.891,"Jamie, you want to get this guy out of my face before I break his fucking skull?"
00:12:06.518,00:12:08.353,"Sorry, bro."
00:12:08.395,00:12:12.023,"You don't fucking know me, man! Don't talk to me like you know me!"
00:12:12.065,00:12:14.817,"What, you think I'm all chill 'cause I snowboard and shit?"
00:12:14.859,00:12:17.070,"One more word, I'll fuck you up like dynamite!"
00:12:18.112,00:12:19.489,Dynamite?
00:12:19.531,00:12:20.865,"Aw, I'm just playing, bro."
00:12:22.283,00:12:24.244,Any friend of Jamie's is cool with me.
00:12:24.285,00:12:26.787,"It's all good, man."
00:12:26.829,00:12:29.123,I'm whispering in the ear of a dead man.
00:12:29.999,00:12:31.084,I'll see you later.
00:12:31.125,00:12:33.587,Good to see you.
00:12:33.628,00:12:38.049,Shaun White seems really great.
00:12:38.091,00:12:40.719,How do you know him again?
00:12:40.759,00:12:42.845,"Oh, so you guys have known each other for a while?"
00:12:42.887,00:12:44.347,"No, it was like eight months ago."
00:12:45.098,00:12:47.141,Wow.
00:12:47.183,00:12:49.102,So does the carpet match the drapes?
00:12:49.143,00:12:51.479,"Uh, it's hardwood floors, if you know what I mean."
00:12:51.521,00:12:54.065,My God!
00:12:54.107,00:12:56.317,"Totally kidding, by the way. Just an old friend of mine."
00:12:57.860,00:13:00.071,You guys use the same leave-in conditioner.
00:13:00.113,00:13:01.989,His hair had nice body.
00:13:02.031,00:13:03.782,"Can I get two gyro number sixes, extra sauce?"
00:13:06.160,00:13:07.704,What are you looking for?
00:13:07.746,00:13:09.080,Come on.
00:13:09.122,00:13:10.373,Yep.
00:13:10.957,00:13:12.333,Come on!
00:13:15.670,00:13:17.130,Where are you taking me?
00:13:31.352,00:13:33.313,"Well, here's your open space."
00:13:33.354,00:13:35.774,"Run, gazelle. Run!"
00:13:38.568,00:13:42.572,Wow. This is unbelievable.
00:13:46.242,00:13:48.995,"Okay, this was not on Seinfeld."
00:13:49.036,00:13:51.164,"Come on, what's your dad think about all this?"
00:13:53.333,00:13:55.042,About what?
00:13:55.084,00:13:56.294,"Well, he must have an opinion."
00:13:56.336,00:13:58.129,He used to write for the LA Times for 23 years.
00:13:59.631,00:14:01.048,Somebody did their homework.
00:14:01.090,00:14:05.470,"I have this thing at work. It's called, uh, Google."
00:14:05.512,00:14:07.263,"Come on, what's he think about the job?"
00:14:08.640,00:14:10.141,"Actually, I didn't ask him."
00:14:10.183,00:14:11.643,"Well, then you must know what he'd say."
00:14:16.397,00:14:20.860,"Uh, he'd tell me to go with my gut and that he'd be proud of me no matter what I did."
00:14:23.029,00:14:24.197,Sounds like a really great man.
00:14:26.324,00:14:28.034,"Yeah, he is."
00:14:28.075,00:14:30.704,"Hey, do you want to see something really cool?"
00:14:30.745,00:14:32.872,I always want to see something really cool.
00:14:33.206,00:14:34.290,Come on.
00:14:35.709,00:14:36.876,Okay.
00:14:39.170,00:14:41.631,Only place in the city you can actually see the stars.
00:14:42.507,00:14:44.342,Wow.
00:14:44.384,00:14:46.010,It's pretty awesome.
00:14:47.345,00:14:48.847,I like to come up here to think.
00:14:48.888,00:14:52.266,"Just when it gets a little too much for me down there, it's like..."
00:14:52.308,00:14:53.893,It's like my New York version of a mountaintop.
00:14:54.728,00:14:57.689,"Best part, no cell reception."
00:15:00.817,00:15:02.109,You take all your recruits up here?
00:15:04.445,00:15:06.698,"Actually, never really taken anyone up here."
00:15:07.448,00:15:09.242,Really?
00:15:09.283,00:15:10.744,Thanks.
00:15:10.785,00:15:14.622,"If you tell anyone about this, I will rip your ears off and staple them to your neck."
00:15:16.123,00:15:18.585,Everyone in this city seems really violent.
00:15:19.878,00:15:22.630,"Ooh, come on, let's go."
00:15:22.672,00:15:25.091,We're just getting comfortable.
00:15:25.132,00:15:27.761,It's New York.
00:15:27.802,00:15:30.471,"Come on, come on."
00:15:30.513,00:15:32.932,This is not touristy at all!
00:15:32.973,00:15:35.101,Do we have to power-walk everywhere we go?
00:15:35.142,00:15:36.728,Yes.
00:15:36.770,00:15:40.523,"So everybody just kind of walks wherever they want, then."
00:15:40.565,00:15:42.817,How 'bout right here?
00:15:42.859,00:15:43.943,What do you mean?
00:15:50.366,00:15:51.868,"Oh, my God, it's 1988."
00:15:51.910,00:15:53.953,"All right, smartass, give it five seconds."
00:16:18.895,00:16:21.689,What is this?
00:16:21.731,00:16:24.400,Like on Oprah!
00:16:24.442,00:16:25.610,Should we get out of the way?
00:16:25.652,00:16:27.612,"No, no. Enjoy it."
00:16:31.157,00:16:32.617,It's pretty damn cool.
00:16:36.537,00:16:37.789,It's kind of rad.
00:16:39.457,00:16:41.835,Do these people get paid for this?
00:16:41.876,00:16:44.629,No. No. They kind of just do it for fun.
00:16:46.005,00:16:47.715,It's nice to feel like you're a part of something.
00:16:47.757,00:16:50.217,New York can be a little bit lonely at times.
00:16:50.259,00:16:51.845,And you're trying to sell me on it.
00:16:51.886,00:16:54.806,Every place can be a bit lonely sometimes.
00:16:59.811,00:17:01.020,"Oh, be careful!"
00:17:01.729,00:17:02.981,Come down.
00:17:11.322,00:17:12.782,Shit. Get back down.
00:17:23.083,00:17:25.127,I'm in.
00:17:26.295,00:17:27.881,You sold me.
00:17:27.922,00:17:29.799,I'll take the job.
00:17:29.841,00:17:34.053,"What, are you surprised?"
00:17:35.346,00:17:37.348,Amazing.
00:17:37.390,00:17:40.727,You can all go home now! Thank you!
00:17:40.768,00:17:42.020,Come on.
00:17:42.061,00:17:44.689,"ALL: Congratulations, sell-out!"
00:17:44.731,00:17:46.649,"Thank you, thank you."
00:17:46.691,00:17:51.905,"All I'm saying is, it wasn't so much the pilot's skill that landed that plane on the river as much as the mechanics of the aircraft."
00:17:51.946,00:17:54.281,Are you saying that Captain Sully wasn't a hero?
00:17:54.323,00:17:56.200,"No, no."
00:17:56.242,00:17:57.618,"Uh, there were just other factors."
00:17:57.660,00:17:59.203,Are you not an American?
00:18:11.298,00:18:14.010,"Hey, fuckface, you want to get your shit out of my car or what?"
00:18:14.052,00:18:15.177,I... Yeah.
00:18:16.971,00:18:19.432,Welcome to New York.
00:18:44.248,00:18:46.084,Fuck.
00:18:46.125,00:18:49.169,"So, all I ask is that you give me a little bit of time to gain your trust."
00:18:49.211,00:18:53.841,"I know that I'm new at this, but what I lack in experience I make up for in cliches."
00:18:53.883,00:18:55.134,"So, my door is always open."
00:18:57.095,00:19:00.723,"But seriously, my door is always open."
00:19:03.559,00:19:06.562,"My first order of business, lighter doors."
00:19:08.022,00:19:10.775,Okay.
00:19:10.817,00:19:14.070,"Hey, man."
00:19:14.112,00:19:16.614,"Tommy, I've read your articles."
00:19:16.656,00:19:18.574,Just trying to keep it realsies.
00:19:18.616,00:19:21.828,"Listen, I'd love to take you out one night and troll for cock."
00:19:21.869,00:19:24.204,What?
00:19:21.869,00:19:28.084,"You got some pretty boys out there in LA, but the quality in this town is ri-dick-ulous."
00:19:28.126,00:19:30.586,We can tear this shit up.
00:19:30.628,00:19:31.963,"I'm not gay, Tommy."
00:19:32.005,00:19:35.591,"Really? Oh, I just assumed, art director and, you know..."
00:19:35.633,00:19:38.011,"Hey. No skin, more pipe for me."
00:19:38.052,00:19:40.847,"By the way, doing a piece on racism in hockey."
00:19:40.888,00:19:43.265,I'd love to get your concepts on the font.
00:19:43.307,00:19:47.186,"I'm thinking Helvetica, but I could be persuaded to Courier New."
00:19:47.227,00:19:50.230,But what the fuck do I know? I'm just the sports editor.
00:19:52.066,00:19:53.693,You sure you're not gay?
00:19:53.734,00:19:54.610,I'm sure.
00:19:54.652,00:19:56.278,All right.
00:19:58.739,00:20:00.616,Hey.
00:20:00.658,00:20:03.161,"I'd knock, but you don't have a door."
00:20:03.202,00:20:04.745,I don't.
00:20:04.787,00:20:06.455,"Hey, check this out."
00:20:06.497,00:20:11.544,"SINGER: Yeah, it really does exist."
00:20:13.713,00:20:15.131,Awesome.
00:20:15.173,00:20:16.590,But it'd be even more awesome if this happened.
00:20:18.467,00:20:19.552,Wait for it.
00:20:20.553,00:20:21.929,Nice!
00:20:21.971,00:20:24.057,I got in touch with a guy who puts flash mobs together.
00:20:24.098,00:20:26.642,We're thinking about using them for guerrilla advertising.
00:20:26.684,00:20:29.145,Taking something so pure and commercializing it?
00:20:29.187,00:20:30.646,Knew I found the right guy.
00:20:30.688,00:20:32.982,Here I am.
00:20:33.024,00:20:34.483,Sign it and I will be out of here.
00:20:38.237,00:20:40.364,A whole year? Oof!
00:20:40.406,00:20:43.325,Why do I get the feeling this is the first real commitment you've ever made?
00:20:43.367,00:20:45.995,It's not.
00:20:46.037,00:20:47.496,"And, fuck, do I regret that one."
00:20:47.538,00:20:49.957,Do me a favor.
00:20:47.538,00:20:51.417,"Don't quit or get fired before the year's up, because otherwise I don't get my bonus."
00:20:51.458,00:20:53.794,"Wait, I can leave whenever I want?"
00:20:53.836,00:20:55.713,What's the point of this contract?
00:20:55.755,00:20:56.797,Okay.
00:20:59.425,00:21:01.427,"Nice doing business with you, Dylan Harper."
00:21:03.345,00:21:05.806,"Hey, I was thinking of getting some lunch."
00:21:07.934,00:21:10.394,Are you asking me out?
00:21:10.436,00:21:12.021,"Whoa, I'm not asking you out."
00:21:12.063,00:21:13.981,I'm asking you to show me a restaurant.
00:21:14.023,00:21:16.150,"I mean, I'm the only friend you have in New York. You don't wanna complicate that."
00:21:16.192,00:21:17.276,I know. I'm not asking you out.
00:21:17.317,00:21:22.031,"I mean, sure, we'd have fun, roll around, get into some erotic humiliation fantasy."
00:21:22.073,00:21:25.325,"But it'd all blow up in our faces, end badly, and we'd never speak to each other..."
00:21:25.367,00:21:26.994,I'm not fucking asking you out!
00:21:27.036,00:21:29.413,Okay. You don't like me like that.
00:21:29.455,00:21:31.290,You don't have to be so mean about it.
00:21:32.708,00:21:34.293,I'm sorry.
00:21:35.711,00:21:37.838,"God, you're such a girl. Come on, it's my treat."
00:21:39.673,00:21:41.217,So was it an easy move?
00:21:41.259,00:21:43.094,It was tough leaving my dad.
00:21:43.136,00:21:44.971,My sister gave me some shit.
00:21:45.012,00:21:46.889,"But, uh, timing was right."
00:21:48.975,00:21:50.851,Timing was really right.
00:21:50.893,00:21:53.146,Is that your sister?
00:21:53.187,00:21:55.397,She's great.
00:21:55.439,00:21:57.691,Wants us to stay friends.
00:21:59.693,00:22:02.738,She's also convinced she can cure me of my emotional unavailability.
00:22:04.740,00:22:06.951,You're emotionally unavailable?
00:22:06.993,00:22:10.704,"Oh, my God. I'm emotionally damaged. I haven't seen you at the meetings."
00:22:10.746,00:22:12.748,I'm done with the relationship thing.
00:22:12.790,00:22:14.834,"Girl, you are preaching to the congregation."
00:22:14.875,00:22:16.794,Choir.
00:22:16.836,00:22:19.046,Preaching to the choir.
00:22:19.088,00:22:21.007,That's the expression.
00:22:21.048,00:22:21.966,Then don't be a dick about it.
00:22:24.093,00:22:25.761,"Oh, my God."
00:22:26.553,00:22:28.139,Please.
00:22:28.181,00:22:30.766,Hello. You've reached Dylan Harper's cell phone.
00:22:30.808,00:22:32.476,"He's emotionally unavailable, but if you'd like..."
00:22:32.518,00:22:34.352,John fucking Mayer!
00:22:37.106,00:22:39.984,Wow. Hello? You really do have shitty cell service.
00:22:40.026,00:22:41.110,Uh-huh. Right?
00:22:44.030,00:22:45.614,I'm gonna have some friends over tomorrow.
00:22:45.656,00:22:48.117,"Why don't you come, and you can meet some new people?"
00:22:48.159,00:22:50.410,I'm gonna have to check my schedule.
00:22:50.452,00:22:52.830,I work at GQ now.
00:22:56.083,00:22:57.375,Hey.
00:22:57.417,00:22:58.961,You made it.
00:22:59.003,00:23:01.964,"No, no. Please, come in, come in. Thank you."
00:23:02.006,00:23:03.924,"Hey, everybody! Hey!"
00:23:03.966,00:23:06.844,This here is Dylan.
00:23:08.428,00:23:10.348,He's the reason I can afford all this beer.
00:23:13.059,00:23:14.185,"Okay, all right."
00:23:17.104,00:23:18.731,Am I an animal?
00:23:20.316,00:23:21.399,Yeah.
00:23:22.276,00:23:23.401,"Fuck, I'm pretty good at this."
00:23:49.427,00:23:53.307,Lieutenant Kali's a West Coast street artist I got into about five years ago.
00:23:53.349,00:23:56.060,His postmodern interpretation...
00:23:56.102,00:23:57.770,"I know, right?"
00:24:01.648,00:24:04.735,You will be able to find the perfect candidate to fill the position at your company.
00:24:05.611,00:24:06.444,"Okay, here we go."
00:24:08.114,00:24:13.035,"First up is Joey Morena, who's fluent in Vietnamese and has had 10 years of experience in the culinary field."
00:24:21.210,00:24:22.460,I can't do this anymore.
00:24:24.004,00:24:27.383,"No, I think we both need to go get happy."
00:24:27.425,00:24:29.051,It's not adding up to 100 anymore.
00:24:29.093,00:24:30.510,Yeah.
00:24:30.552,00:24:32.430,Looks like New York's all out of blueberries.
00:24:32.470,00:24:34.181,"Goodbye, Flapjack."
00:24:35.933,00:24:37.768,Taxi! Taxicab!
00:24:37.810,00:24:39.019,Flapjack.
00:24:39.061,00:24:41.855,DYLAN: Why do all these movies have such bad music?
00:24:41.897,00:24:44.150,It's so that you know how to feel every single second.
00:24:44.191,00:24:45.692,I'm heartbroken.
00:24:48.070,00:24:50.448,I'm getting married to the man of my dreams.
00:24:53.242,00:24:55.202,I'm sneaking through an office.
00:24:58.331,00:24:59.415,"Madison, wait!"
00:25:00.082,00:25:01.959,Madison!
00:25:02.001,00:25:03.710,"Madison, wait!"
00:25:04.878,00:25:06.713,Bryce.
00:25:06.755,00:25:09.049,How did you know I was at Grand Central Station?
00:25:09.091,00:25:11.927,"You're not. You're in Los Angeles, where this movie was shot."
00:25:11.969,00:25:13.511,I know you better than you know yourself.
00:25:15.181,00:25:17.515,And your crazy friend Susie across the hall told me.
00:25:18.100,00:25:19.352,Susie.
00:25:20.227,00:25:21.895,Why are you here?
00:25:21.937,00:25:32.114,"To tell you that I love that sunsets make you cry, and I don't care that you failed your real estate exam, and I'm glad that you have a five-date rule."
00:25:33.240,00:25:35.784,And that I love you.
00:25:35.826,00:25:37.370,Not as much as I love you.
00:25:39.913,00:25:42.582,"Now boarding, track 5, love."
00:25:42.624,00:25:45.336,"God, I wish my life was a movie sometimes."
00:25:45.378,00:25:49.465,"You know, I'd never have to worry about my hair, or having to go to the bathroom."
00:25:49.507,00:25:55.971,"And then, when I'm at my lowest point, some guy would chase me down the street, pour his heart out, and we'd kiss."
00:25:57.014,00:25:58.182,Happily ever after.
00:26:00.100,00:26:02.311,"I mean, a horse and carriage?"
00:26:02.353,00:26:05.481,"Come on, that is awesome."
00:26:05.523,00:26:15.573,Not as awesome as this ambiguously upbeat pop song that has nothing to do with the plot they put in at the end to try to convince you that you had a great time at this shitty movie.
00:26:15.615,00:26:18.369,"You know, why don't they ever make a movie about what happens after the big kiss?"
00:26:18.411,00:26:19.577,They do. It's called porn.
00:26:22.081,00:26:23.581,"God, I miss sex."
00:26:25.167,00:26:26.960,"Right? I mean, sometimes you just need it. It's like..."
00:26:28.546,00:26:30.506,"I don't know, it's like cracking your neck."
00:26:30.548,00:26:32.299,Why does it always gotta come with complications?
00:26:32.341,00:26:34.134,And emotions.
00:26:34.176,00:26:36.303,Guilt.
00:26:36.345,00:26:38.431,It's women's fault.
00:26:38.472,00:26:42.142,You heard me. Hold me.
00:26:42.184,00:26:43.936,"Oh, please, you are no better."
00:26:43.977,00:26:47.523,"Oh, yeah, baby, come on, now. Say my name. Yeah..."
00:26:47.565,00:26:50.192,I'm done.
00:26:50.234,00:26:51.193,Who have you been with?
00:26:52.652,00:26:54.530,Why can't it not be like that?
00:26:54.572,00:26:59.368,It's a physical act.
00:26:59.410,00:27:01.787,Two people should be able to have sex like they're playing tennis.
00:27:01.828,00:27:05.541,"Yeah, I mean, no one wants to go away for the weekend after they play tennis."
00:27:05.583,00:27:08.335,It's just a game.
00:27:08.377,00:27:09.627,Yeah.
00:27:10.837,00:27:12.131,Mmm.
00:27:12.172,00:27:14.049,Do you want more beer?
00:27:14.091,00:27:15.384,Okay.
00:27:23.183,00:27:24.851,Jamie!
00:27:24.893,00:27:26.728,Let's play tennis.
00:27:26.770,00:27:28.188,Let's have sex like we're playing tennis.
00:27:28.230,00:27:30.107,Get the hell out of here.
00:27:30.149,00:27:32.401,Don't laugh. This could be great.
00:27:32.443,00:27:33.986,This could take all the weirdness out of it.
00:27:34.027,00:27:36.654,"Well, we talked about this. I don't like you like that."
00:27:36.696,00:27:39.158,I don't like you like that either. That's why it's perfect.
00:27:39.199,00:27:41.994,know if I find you attractive.
00:27:42.035,00:27:43.370,That's cute.
00:27:43.412,00:27:45.956,"Well, I do have a thing for jerks."
00:27:45.998,00:27:47.625,"Okay, well, do you even find me attractive?"
00:27:47.665,00:27:49.168,That's cute.
00:27:49.209,00:27:51.795,Before you got to know my awesome personality.
00:27:51.837,00:27:52.670,Strictly physical.
00:27:53.713,00:27:54.965,First time you saw me.
00:27:56.674,00:27:59.136,This is just two people talking?
00:27:59.178,00:28:02.055,Two girls over drinks at Bennigan's. Go.
00:28:04.141,00:28:06.684,"I liked your eyes. I didn't think I'd ever seen such big, beautiful eyes."
00:28:10.022,00:28:12.774,Your lips. Yeah.
00:28:13.192,00:28:14.943,I am.
00:28:14.985,00:28:16.403,Your breasts.
00:28:16.445,00:28:17.779,They intrigued me.
00:28:17.821,00:28:20.616,Yeah.
00:28:20.658,00:28:22.075,They're still breasts.
00:28:23.452,00:28:25.120,I liked your hands.
00:28:25.162,00:28:26.246,Butt.
00:28:26.288,00:28:27.414,Chest.
00:28:27.456,00:28:28.915,You said that.
00:28:32.586,00:28:35.297,You swear you don't want anything more from me other than sex?
00:28:35.339,00:28:37.841,You swear you don't want anything more from me?
00:28:37.883,00:28:40.802,"I know how you girls get. Tick-tock, tick-tock."
00:28:40.844,00:28:42.929,Stop it.
00:28:42.971,00:28:47.226,What are you doing?
00:28:47.267,00:28:50.020,You have a Bible app?
00:28:50.062,00:28:51.522,Hand on the iPad.
00:28:51.564,00:28:52.981,"Wait, no."
00:28:53.023,00:28:54.441,Why can't they figure this out?
00:28:54.483,00:28:57.777,No... This thing thinks I'm you and you're me.
00:28:57.819,00:28:59.279,Keep your hand still.
00:28:59.321,00:29:00.573,It's actually making me dizzy.
00:29:01.907,00:29:02.949,There we go.
00:29:07.287,00:29:09.164,No relationship.
00:29:09.206,00:29:10.374,No emotions.
00:29:11.124,00:29:12.376,Just sex.
00:29:12.418,00:29:15.212,"Whatever happens, we stay friends."
00:29:15.254,00:29:16.171,Swear.
00:29:16.213,00:29:17.256,BOTH: Swear.
00:29:21.468,00:29:22.720,Okay.
00:29:27.433,00:29:29.768,So I guess we should just start.
00:29:31.144,00:29:32.104,Okay.
00:29:33.272,00:29:34.732,I'll serve.
00:29:34.814,00:29:36.942,That's really...
00:29:36.983,00:29:38.151,Let's go to the bedroom.
00:29:38.193,00:29:40.195,What's wrong with the couch? It's less emotional.
00:29:40.237,00:29:42.030,The bedroom has better light.
00:29:42.072,00:29:44.575,"And since we're just friends, I don't have to be insecure about my body."
00:29:44.617,00:29:46.702,"Come on, okay?"
00:29:46.744,00:29:48.579,You have nothing to be insecure about.
00:29:50.247,00:29:54.710,"No, you see, that is way too emotionally supportive and you need to just lock that down."
00:29:56.962,00:29:59.381,Your ass is a little bony.
00:29:59.423,00:30:05.429,"My nipples are sensitive, I don't like dirty talk, and had I known this was gonna happen, I would have shaved my legs this morning."
00:30:05.471,00:30:10.726,"My chin is ticklish, I sneeze sometimes after I come, and if I'd have known this was gonna happen, I wouldn't have shaved my legs this morning."
00:30:10.768,00:30:11.810,Okie-dokie.
00:30:13.019,00:30:14.104,Oh!
00:30:14.146,00:30:16.898,I keep my socks on.
00:30:16.940,00:30:18.609,"Great, 'cause feet gross me out."
00:30:18.651,00:30:19.818,Great.
00:30:24.239,00:30:25.324,I can work with that.
00:30:28.285,00:30:29.244,Should be fine.
00:30:32.414,00:30:34.040,I can't believe I'm doing this.
00:30:34.082,00:30:35.917,Should we stop?
00:30:35.959,00:30:37.252,I don't know.
00:30:38.337,00:30:40.172,Sex?
00:30:40.213,00:30:43.091,It just... I don't know.
00:30:43.133,00:30:45.093,Oh. I could sing some Third Eye Blind.
00:30:45.135,00:30:48.681,One last call for alcohol...
00:30:48.722,00:30:51.016,That's not Third Eye Blind.
00:30:51.057,00:30:52.184,Nope.
00:30:52.225,00:30:58.064,"whiskey or beer, What's wrong?"
00:30:58.106,00:30:59.358,I totally agree.
00:30:59.399,00:31:00.567,Great.
00:31:00.609,00:31:01.943,Little faster.
00:31:01.985,00:31:04.279,More circular.
00:31:04.321,00:31:05.447,Touch my ears.
00:31:07.115,00:31:08.283,Oh! Kiss my neck.
00:31:09.535,00:31:11.203,Say my name.
00:31:11.244,00:31:12.538,Not my full name.
00:31:12.579,00:31:13.539,"Sorry, I had to fill out a lot of your paperwork."
00:31:13.580,00:31:14.748,Stop talking.
00:31:14.790,00:31:16.958,"Oh, my God, you're really... Oh."
00:31:18.669,00:31:24.132,"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P..."
00:31:24.174,00:31:26.719,"Uh, Dylan, I..."
00:31:26.760,00:31:28.804,Just a friend going down on another friend.
00:31:28.846,00:31:30.639,"Oh, yeah, baby."
00:31:34.768,00:31:36.102,"Ow, ow! What, what?"
00:31:36.144,00:31:38.271,What are you trying to do? Dig your way to China?
00:31:38.313,00:31:39.648,I'm good at this.
00:31:39.690,00:31:41.483,Every girl I've been with.
00:31:41.525,00:31:43.777,"Well, they're either lying or their vaginas are made out of burlap."
00:31:43.819,00:31:45.738,"So, relax. You're not a lizard."
00:31:45.779,00:31:47.740,"Okay, fine."
00:31:50.200,00:31:52.035,A little to the right.
00:31:52.077,00:31:53.537,A little bit more to the left.
00:31:53.579,00:31:55.372,Now go down.
00:31:55.414,00:31:57.624,A little more...
00:32:03.547,00:32:04.964,What's wrong?
00:32:05.006,00:32:06.383,"When women start to scream, it could be misconstrued."
00:32:06.425,00:32:07.843,Just keep going!
00:32:17.519,00:32:18.353,"Yeah, you know it."
00:32:23.275,00:32:26.236,"Well, let me tell you how I like it."
00:32:26.278,00:32:31.658,"See, most girls think you should start off soft, but if you just get in, really go for it..."
00:32:44.546,00:32:46.214,"Yeah, you know it."
00:32:46.256,00:32:47.090,Mmm.
00:32:48.425,00:32:49.509,Ugh!
00:33:05.275,00:33:08.445,Let's go with Obama.
00:33:08.487,00:33:11.573,"It's too easy, too predictable."
00:33:11.615,00:33:16.829,"He's stylish, transcendent of sport, has an ass like a kumquat."
00:33:16.870,00:33:19.581,I hear he's kind of a jerk.
00:33:19.623,00:33:25.295,You're just threatened by him because he's the greatest snow sport athlete in the universe and he gets more squirrel than an oak tree.
00:33:25.337,00:33:27.380,"Hey, Dylan?"
00:33:27.422,00:33:29.174,"Okay, thanks."
00:33:29.215,00:33:31.468,Let's hit this after lunch.
00:33:31.510,00:33:33.762,"Nobody wants to fuck Obama, brah."
00:33:33.804,00:33:35.138,He's got ears like an elephant.
00:33:35.180,00:33:37.140,That's not the part of an elephant you want.
00:33:41.394,00:33:42.646,Hi!
00:33:45.983,00:33:47.818,Sorry to just show up like this.
00:33:47.860,00:33:48.986,"No, no, no, it's fine."
00:33:49.695,00:33:50.779,So...
00:33:53.740,00:33:54.700,Wanna take a walk?
00:33:54.741,00:33:57.035,Great. Okay.
00:34:03.000,00:34:04.543,"Okay, so about what happened, I..."
00:34:04.584,00:34:07.128,It was crazy and we shouldn't have done it.
00:34:07.170,00:34:08.505,"I mean, it is so not me."
00:34:08.547,00:34:10.966,I totally agree.
00:34:11.008,00:34:14.594,"Great. I mean, look, I've had one-night stands."
00:34:14.636,00:34:17.430,"We both have had one-night stands, none of which we're proud of, but..."
00:34:18.431,00:34:20.475,Really?
00:34:20.517,00:34:24.980,"Look, to think that you and I could just have sex and without it compromising anything was just so..."
00:34:25.022,00:34:27.649,Misguided.
00:34:27.691,00:34:29.150,I was gonna call you this morning.
00:34:29.192,00:34:30.360,But you didn't.
00:34:30.402,00:34:31.778,But I didn't.
00:34:31.820,00:34:33.739,"And you see, it's already coming between us and I really..."
00:34:33.780,00:34:35.240,I just don't want it to.
00:34:35.281,00:34:36.825,It's not going to.
00:34:36.867,00:34:39.619,"Look, I know that I act all tough and I talk all tough, but really..."
00:34:39.661,00:34:43.206,It's just a front to protect yourself from your own vulnerability.
00:34:43.248,00:34:45.000,"What are you, my fucking therapist now?"
00:34:45.042,00:34:49.838,"No, I'm a friend. Who knows that every time you curse, you blink."
00:34:49.880,00:34:53.216,Like your body's rejecting the word.
00:34:53.258,00:34:54.342,Fuck you.
00:34:54.384,00:34:56.177,"No, I didn't fucking blink."
00:34:56.219,00:34:58.513,Shit.
00:34:58.555,00:35:00.473,Shit you're okay with.
00:35:00.515,00:35:01.850,It was stupid.
00:35:01.892,00:35:03.142,"We're friends, let's stay friends."
00:35:03.184,00:35:04.603,"Yes. Yes, this, I don't wanna lose this."
00:35:04.644,00:35:06.021,Me neither.
00:35:06.063,00:35:07.230,Great.
00:35:07.272,00:35:09.024,Portrait for the lovely couple?
00:35:17.699,00:35:19.117,What the hell are we doing?
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.705,Rub my hair.
00:35:27.084,00:35:27.876,Watch my nipple.
00:35:29.795,00:35:31.880,I didn't know you had a tattoo.
00:35:31.922,00:35:33.090,Why didn't I notice that before?
00:35:33.131,00:35:34.800,Because we were drunk.
00:35:34.841,00:35:36.760,Was it your dog?
00:35:36.802,00:35:38.177,But everyone else did.
00:35:38.219,00:35:41.556,"And I thought having a dog meant you had a normal family, which at 17 I desperately wanted."
00:35:41.598,00:35:45.143,So as a sign of rebellion you got a tattoo of the most conventional thing you could think of.
00:35:45.184,00:35:46.937,It was super awesome back then.
00:35:46.979,00:35:48.271,Check it.
00:35:48.313,00:35:49.689,A lightning bolt?
00:35:49.731,00:35:50.774,Wanted superpowers.
00:35:51.984,00:35:53.819,I was a little into Harry Potter back then.
00:35:53.860,00:35:56.529,Were you also gay back then?
00:35:56.571,00:35:58.364,Okay.
00:35:58.406,00:35:59.491,Are you?
00:35:59.532,00:36:00.492,Me neither.
00:36:05.080,00:36:08.041,How was your day?
00:36:08.083,00:36:09.793,I had a turkey sandwich for lunch.
00:36:09.835,00:36:11.670,It wasn't that good.
00:36:11.711,00:36:13.922,Still trying to figure out that subway system.
00:36:16.842,00:36:18.176,And it's out of here!
00:36:24.724,00:36:26.392,My butt.
00:36:26.434,00:36:28.394,"Oh, my butt."
00:36:28.436,00:36:31.356,"No, I mean my butt, it's cramping. Can you grab a pillow?"
00:36:31.397,00:36:32.398,"Okay, yeah, yeah."
00:36:33.900,00:36:35.527,"So, no butt?"
00:36:39.114,00:36:41.491,Really? Already?
00:36:46.621,00:36:48.790,Do you like this position?
00:36:51.543,00:36:54.796,"I gotta be honest, I feel a little emasculated."
00:36:54.838,00:36:58.424,A naked girl is lying on top of you and you feel emasculated?
00:37:00.052,00:37:02.345,Little bit.
00:37:02.387,00:37:04.389,"Yes, I know what it means, and I feel it."
00:37:04.430,00:37:07.059,"Okay, all right, you big baby."
00:37:07.100,00:37:09.102,Chinese fire drill.
00:37:10.979,00:37:12.189,Okay.
00:37:15.233,00:37:16.693,Do you feel manly now?
00:37:16.735,00:37:17.861,Okay. Put it in.
00:37:19.404,00:37:20.780,That's not funny.
00:37:20.822,00:37:22.199,It's kind of funny.
00:37:26.828,00:37:28.038,Hold on.
00:37:28.080,00:37:29.330,I have to go to the bathroom.
00:37:29.372,00:37:31.249,What? Now?
00:37:42.886,00:37:44.054,What's going on in there?
00:37:44.096,00:37:45.638,Do you know how hard it is to pee with a hard-on?
00:37:45.680,00:37:47.182,"No, actually."
00:37:47.224,00:37:49.017,It's like two lanes of traffic merging into one. It takes time.
00:37:49.059,00:37:50.185,Hmm.
00:37:55.774,00:37:57.483,Are you pooping?
00:37:57.525,00:37:59.652,Why are you sitting down?
00:37:59.694,00:38:02.822,You want a mess in here?
00:38:14.542,00:38:15.585,Oh!
00:38:16.461,00:38:17.420,Yeah.
00:38:18.421,00:38:19.297,Yup.
00:38:22.634,00:38:23.760,What? Did I leak?
00:38:23.802,00:38:24.677,Did you wash your hands?
00:38:25.303,00:38:26.596,"Oh, come on, dude."
00:38:26.638,00:38:28.723,"I know we're just friends, but I'm still a lady."
00:38:28.765,00:38:32.018,"Now get back in there, wash your hands and then bring that fine ass back here."
00:38:32.060,00:38:34.312,"If you keep talking to me like that, I'm not gonna come back."
00:38:40.359,00:38:43.362,My hammies are killing me.
00:38:43.404,00:38:44.864,Why would you keep bananas in the fridge?
00:38:44.906,00:38:47.242,It dries them out.
00:38:47.284,00:38:48.660,It's not armor.
00:38:48.701,00:38:50.245,Do you want a banana or not?
00:38:50.287,00:38:51.329,Not if they're dry.
00:38:53.748,00:38:55.500,At least I have food in the house.
00:38:55.541,00:38:57.627,All you have at home is drinkable yogurt.
00:38:57.669,00:38:59.879,I like to drink my yogurt. It's a timesaver.
00:38:59.921,00:39:02.257,"Well, then you think you could use that time to shave your stubble."
00:39:02.299,00:39:04.259,Your whiskers are like knives.
00:39:04.301,00:39:07.679,"Now, see, if you were my girlfriend, I couldn't tell you to shut up right now."
00:39:07.720,00:39:14.686,"And because you're just my buddy, I can tell you that if you don't start shaving up here, I'm gonna stop shaving down there."
00:39:19.858,00:39:20.817,"Hey, hey. Hey... Whoa!"
00:39:20.859,00:39:22.694,Mom!
00:39:22.735,00:39:24.154,"Whoa, whoa."
00:39:24.196,00:39:26.698,My eyes are covered.
00:39:26.739,00:39:29.450,I can't see you putting on your black underpants.
00:39:29.492,00:39:31.536,"Jamie, baby, I missed you."
00:39:31.577,00:39:33.288,"Oh, baby."
00:39:33.330,00:39:35.915,Did your boobs get bigger?
00:39:35.957,00:39:38.960,"Oh, hey, baby."
00:39:39.002,00:39:42.797,What are you doing here?
00:39:42.839,00:39:46.009,L-O-M-B-A-R-D.
00:39:46.051,00:39:47.468,"Victor, her fiance."
00:39:47.510,00:39:49.137,Ex-fiance.
00:39:49.179,00:39:51.348,What happened?
00:39:51.389,00:39:53.308,"I mean, nice, but it was like talking to dirt."
00:39:53.350,00:39:56.853,"I woke up one day and I said, Lorna... I'm Lorna."
00:39:56.895,00:40:00.106,Dylan.
00:40:00.148,00:40:02.150,Just because you're 39...
00:40:02.192,00:40:04.610,...it doesn't mean you have to settle. He's not an insurance claim.
00:40:04.652,00:40:06.571,So I caught the first plane off the island.
00:40:06.612,00:40:09.574,Cleveland's not an island.
00:40:09.615,00:40:12.327,"Anyway, here I am. It's so good to see you."
00:40:12.369,00:40:14.996,You never told me you had a hot boyfriend.
00:40:15.038,00:40:16.789,"He's not my boyfriend, Mom."
00:40:16.831,00:40:18.750,That's right.
00:40:18.791,00:40:21.336,Ooh. It's like the '70s in here.
00:40:21.378,00:40:24.214,Ooh! That was a better time. Just sex.
00:40:24.256,00:40:27.425,"A little grass, a little glue..."
00:40:27.466,00:40:29.261,"Well, not during the final trimester."
00:40:29.302,00:40:32.847,But no complications.
00:40:32.889,00:40:35.350,"Okay, well, that's technically, I guess, what this is."
00:40:35.392,00:40:36.935,That's exactly what this is.
00:40:36.976,00:40:38.895,So my daughter is just your slampiece?
00:40:38.937,00:40:40.939,"No, no."
00:40:40.980,00:40:43.316,I'm just kidding.
00:40:43.358,00:40:44.692,Have fun.
00:40:44.734,00:40:46.611,"The only thing is, it takes you off the market."
00:40:46.652,00:40:48.529,But what the hell.
00:40:46.652,00:40:52.658,"The whole reason you go to the market is to buy the produce, which you already got."
00:40:52.700,00:40:56.454,"It's so good to see you, baby. I'm only gonna be here a few weeks."
00:40:56.495,00:40:58.831,I'm starving.
00:40:58.873,00:41:00.375,It's in the kitchen.
00:41:01.918,00:41:03.586,You gotta go.
00:41:03.628,00:41:06.005,Is she wearing Axe body spray?
00:41:06.047,00:41:08.591,"LORNA: Bananas in the refrigerator? What are you, Puerto Rican?"
00:41:08.633,00:41:12.220,"That is terrible, Mother."
00:41:12.262,00:41:13.805,What? You said that he was Greek.
00:41:13.846,00:41:15.432,"Potato, potato..."
00:41:15.473,00:41:18.059,Okay. All right.
00:41:18.101,00:41:19.560,I'll just put these on on the bike?
00:41:19.602,00:41:21.313,Yeah.
00:41:21.354,00:41:22.521,It was nice to have met you...
00:41:22.563,00:41:24.190,LORNA: Hey.
00:41:24.232,00:41:26.109,"Oh, my... Mom!"
00:41:28.403,00:41:29.487,"Back, back!"
00:41:33.366,00:41:36.244,That's what I'm talking about!
00:41:36.286,00:41:38.913,We're kicking every gay ass out here!
00:41:38.955,00:41:41.207,"I don't say that pejoratively, I say it hopefully."
00:41:41.249,00:41:43.042,Hold it.
00:41:43.084,00:41:44.836,Not even you?
00:41:44.877,00:41:46.879,Come talk to me after.
00:41:46.921,00:41:48.506,I might be able to let you see some reason.
00:41:54.679,00:41:56.514,Look at you in the house!
00:41:56.555,00:41:57.515,"Come on, baby!"
00:41:59.184,00:42:00.226,I'm supposed to meet up with Jamie.
00:42:01.560,00:42:03.313,"Who's that, that headhunter?"
00:42:03.355,00:42:04.981,"What, you guys going out now?"
00:42:05.023,00:42:07.733,"No, no, no, we're just friends. We're messing around a little bit."
00:42:07.775,00:42:09.486,What do you mean?
00:42:09.527,00:42:10.945,But it's just sex.
00:42:10.987,00:42:12.864,"That never works, bro."
00:42:12.905,00:42:16.493,She's a girl. Sex always means more to them even if they don't admit it.
00:42:16.534,00:42:17.910,Jamie's different.
00:42:17.952,00:42:20.497,Does she have a penis where most girls have a vagina?
00:42:20.538,00:42:22.457,No penis.
00:42:22.499,00:42:24.000,"What do you know about women, anyway?"
00:42:24.042,00:42:26.627,"Dude, I've turned down more tail than you'll ever have."
00:42:26.669,00:42:28.171,"Yeah, bro."
00:42:28.213,00:42:32.175,"But the offers still keep rolling in, naturally. Look at me."
00:42:32.217,00:42:38.473,"And, hey, I love women. They're beautiful, majestic, mysterious, mesmerizing creatures."
00:42:38.515,00:42:42.768,"Smart, empathetic."
00:42:42.810,00:42:46.189,"And if I had a choice, I would be with women to my dying day."
00:42:46.231,00:42:49.192,But me likes cock so I'm strict-aly dick-aly.
00:42:50.527,00:42:52.904,"So it's always just about sex, then?"
00:42:52.945,00:42:56.449,No. I've been in love. I went down that rabbit hole.
00:42:56.491,00:42:58.576,You know what I discovered?
00:42:58.617,00:43:02.997,"It's not who you want to spend Friday night with, it's who you want to spend all day Saturday with."
00:43:03.039,00:43:04.623,"Feel me, Felix?"
00:43:04.665,00:43:08.294,"Yeah, but then it's every Saturday for the rest of your life."
00:43:08.336,00:43:09.879,"It's okay, you don't get it."
00:43:09.921,00:43:12.840,It's no big deal.
00:43:12.882,00:43:16.928,"One day, you'll meet someone and it'll literally take your breath away."
00:43:16.969,00:43:21.015,Like you can't breathe. Like no oxygen to the lungs.
00:43:21.057,00:43:23.226,Like a fish...
00:43:23.851,00:43:25.603,"Yeah, you don't."
00:43:25.644,00:43:28.356,"Nice work on that new online site, by the way."
00:43:28.398,00:43:30.149,What was the font on that headline?
00:43:30.191,00:43:31.401,It was Times Roman.
00:43:31.443,00:43:33.528,Times Roman.
00:43:40.076,00:43:41.327,You have a boat?
00:43:41.369,00:43:45.373,I live in Jersey.
00:43:45.415,00:43:47.708,Unless it's out to dinner and a show.
00:44:03.308,00:44:05.184,Hey.
00:44:05.226,00:44:10.022,You and that Dylan? Way to go.
00:44:10.064,00:44:11.774,"Kudos, baby, kudos."
00:44:13.276,00:44:14.652,It's not that big of a deal.
00:44:14.693,00:44:16.279,It's just surprising.
00:44:16.321,00:44:19.157,I always thought you were a true-love kind of girl.
00:44:19.198,00:44:22.118,"Uh, whatever, Mom."
00:44:22.160,00:44:23.786,That's what I thought back in '78.
00:44:24.579,00:44:26.498,And every year since.
00:44:26.539,00:44:28.791,I'm just...
00:44:28.833,00:44:31.586,The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
00:44:31.628,00:44:33.379,It's just surprising.
00:44:35.006,00:44:37.634,"There, done. It's..."
00:44:39.427,00:44:42.180,"Oh, you look great!"
00:44:43.055,00:44:44.182,Yeah!
00:44:44.223,00:44:46.017,Yeah.
00:44:46.058,00:44:49.937,"Hey, my friend gave me his house in Montauk for July 4th."
00:44:49.979,00:44:52.898,Let's you and me go away together.
00:44:52.940,00:44:56.402,Just mother-daughter.
00:44:56.444,00:44:59.155,When was the last time we spent a full weekend together?
00:44:59.197,00:45:02.158,"When I was eight, that time in Vermont. We got snowed in with the ski instructor."
00:45:02.200,00:45:03.451,Demitri.
00:45:03.493,00:45:05.203,He reminded me a lot of your father.
00:45:05.244,00:45:08.623,"Dark curls, olive skin, Cold War accent."
00:45:08.665,00:45:10.625,My father was Russian?
00:45:10.667,00:45:13.961,But what I do remember is we drank a lot of vodka and shot a lot of guns.
00:45:14.003,00:45:17.423,"Mom, this who's your daddy game is getting really old."
00:45:17.465,00:45:19.842,I know I haven't been the best mother in the world...
00:45:23.137,00:45:24.681,"I'm sorry, were you waiting for me to jump in?"
00:45:24.721,00:45:27.724,Come on!
00:45:28.601,00:45:30.936,Come on. Come on.
00:45:30.978,00:45:33.730,"Okay, we'll do it."
00:45:40.530,00:45:42.615,Mom...
00:45:42.657,00:45:44.741,It was either this or sniff glue.
00:45:50.582,00:45:52.917,Sorry about my mom.
00:45:52.958,00:45:58.089,"Yeah, she's really funny when she's asking for money, and she's hilarious when she needs a place to stay."
00:46:03.802,00:46:06.681,"Dylan, I think I wanna start dating again."
00:46:07.764,00:46:10.518,"Listen, I think we should stop this."
00:46:12.978,00:46:14.771,Hmm.
00:46:15.565,00:46:16.691,I kind of think you're right.
00:46:16.733,00:46:18.526,Right?
00:46:18.568,00:46:25.575,comes from some other That actually makes sense right here.
00:46:25.617,00:46:27.368,Who would've thought Third Eye Blind could be so prophetic?
00:46:27.410,00:46:28.745,Not Third Eye Blind.
00:46:28.785,00:46:30.663,I'm pretty sure that's Third Eye Blind.
00:46:30.705,00:46:31.748,Do you wanna go grab some lunch?
00:46:31.788,00:46:33.124,Yes.
00:46:33.165,00:46:34.709,You're buying.
00:46:37.002,00:46:37.878,Okay.
00:46:39.004,00:46:40.256,Oh.
00:46:40.298,00:46:42.216,Pants.
00:46:42.258,00:46:43.468,So this is the end of this?
00:46:43.509,00:46:45.553,I guess so.
00:46:45.595,00:46:46.929,And we did it.
00:46:46.971,00:46:47.804,Shirt.
00:46:48.931,00:46:51.142,We managed to actually stay friends.
00:46:51.183,00:46:52.101,Yup.
00:46:56.813,00:46:58.524,"Okay. So, what is your type, anyway?"
00:46:58.566,00:47:00.901,"No, I don't have a type."
00:47:00.943,00:47:03.112,It's more about what's inside.
00:47:03.154,00:47:05.448,"Okay, what about her?"
00:47:05.490,00:47:07.492,"DYLAN: Uh, yeah. I could get to know her inside."
00:47:07.533,00:47:08.576,And she's reading a book.
00:47:09.619,00:47:11.245,It's probably Nicholas Sparks.
00:47:11.287,00:47:13.456,I'm gonna go talk to her.
00:47:13.498,00:47:15.458,"What do you mean, What?"
00:47:15.500,00:47:17.251,I'm gonna go talk to her.
00:47:17.293,00:47:19.044,"Here, in front of all of these people?"
00:47:19.086,00:47:21.838,I didn't say I was gonna rape her. I said I was gonna go talk to her.
00:47:26.010,00:47:29.347,Excuse me. I'm Dylan.
00:47:29.388,00:47:30.348,"Oh, The Notebook."
00:47:36.813,00:47:37.854,DYLAN: Nice meeting you.
00:47:41.858,00:47:44.153,Well?
00:47:44.195,00:47:45.780,Yeah.
00:47:45.822,00:47:48.240,She's Belgian.
00:47:48.282,00:47:52.453,"I showed her where the balcony was, because that's where she is meeting up with her husband."
00:47:52.495,00:47:54.413,Oh!
00:47:54.455,00:47:55.872,DYLAN: Anniversary trip to New York.
00:47:55.914,00:47:58.793,Three kids.
00:47:59.960,00:48:02.129,Shut up.
00:48:02.171,00:48:05.132,Why are you still laughing?
00:48:05.174,00:48:08.052,Fine. I'll go next.
00:48:08.093,00:48:10.388,See if I still have game.
00:48:10.429,00:48:11.972,Okay.
00:48:12.014,00:48:13.890,Yes.
00:48:13.932,00:48:17.019,Iced coffee.
00:48:17.061,00:48:21.733,"Staring at a tree, which means he's actually in the park for nature and not to watch women sunbathe."
00:48:21.774,00:48:23.275,Or he's retarded.
00:48:23.317,00:48:24.402,I'm going in.
00:48:31.450,00:48:32.785,Excuse me.
00:48:33.369,00:48:34.245,Hi.
00:48:34.871,00:48:35.996,I'm Jamie.
00:48:37.790,00:48:38.915,"Yeah. Yeah, that works."
00:48:40.793,00:48:41.918,"Oh, hi."
00:48:44.380,00:48:45.882,Okay.
00:48:45.922,00:48:47.007,Nice to meet you.
00:48:51.637,00:48:56.308,Okay. His name is Parker.
00:48:57.685,00:48:59.437,And I have a date this Saturday.
00:49:00.563,00:49:01.731,Nice.
00:49:02.565,00:49:04.941,Why'd you wave to me?
00:49:04.983,00:49:09.822,"I told him you were my gay best friend, so he wants to set you up with his brother."
00:49:12.450,00:49:16.788,"PARKER: College, med school, and I haven't slept since."
00:49:16.829,00:49:19.039,JAMIE: I can't believe you actually cure cancer.
00:49:19.081,00:49:20.957,"Well, me and God."
00:49:21.793,00:49:23.795,What?
00:49:23.836,00:49:26.255,Can you imagine someone who would actually say that?
00:49:26.297,00:49:28.549,"Yeah, I could."
00:49:28.591,00:49:29.966,Cancer doctors?
00:49:30.718,00:49:32.052,Yeah.
00:49:32.094,00:49:34.472,"Well, hopefully you're all done with that."
00:49:34.513,00:49:37.809,"Although, I gotta warn you, lot of cancer doctors, big assholes."
00:49:37.850,00:49:39.143,Really?
00:49:39.184,00:49:42.187,"Oh, and, uh, brain surgeons, huge perverts."
00:49:42.229,00:49:44.816,"While they're doing this, a little bit of that."
00:49:46.275,00:49:47.485,Hey.
00:49:48.778,00:49:49.986,Thank you.
00:49:50.863,00:49:52.573,When can I see you again?
00:49:56.160,00:49:57.202,Right now.
00:49:57.244,00:49:58.663,Ah.
00:49:58.704,00:50:00.289,I'm just kidding.
00:50:00.331,00:50:02.750,Can you imagine someone who would actually say that?
00:50:02.792,00:50:04.376,JAMIE: I played the tuba in high school.
00:50:04.418,00:50:06.963,World's stupidest instrument.
00:50:07.003,00:50:08.840,Especially when you move eight times.
00:50:08.881,00:50:12.551,Why'd you move?
00:50:08.881,00:50:14.219,"My mom really likes to break up with guys, and she was really good at it."
00:50:14.261,00:50:16.764,Was your dad one of them?
00:50:16.806,00:50:18.390,I actually never knew my dad.
00:50:18.432,00:50:19.642,I'm sorry. That sucks.
00:50:22.854,00:50:25.105,"All right, look, I think I should probably tell you something."
00:50:25.147,00:50:26.858,Please don't tell me you're a dude.
00:50:26.899,00:50:30.903,"Because that'll be like the third time since I moved here, and I don't think I can handle that."
00:50:30.945,00:50:32.989,I have a five-date rule.
00:50:33.029,00:50:35.867,"You know, like, five dates before we..."
00:50:35.908,00:50:38.243,I saw it in a movie.
00:50:39.745,00:50:40.663,You're worth waiting for.
00:50:42.080,00:50:43.749,I'm sure that was the line in the movie you saw.
00:50:45.501,00:50:47.003,PARKER: That's awesome.
00:50:47.043,00:50:50.965,"This four-year-old that I've been working on for the last couple months, he's gonna be fine."
00:50:51.007,00:50:52.048,That's great.
00:50:53.049,00:50:54.886,How is a guy like you single?
00:50:54.927,00:51:00.558,I've just been waiting for someone to come up to me in the park and compliment me for looking at the trees and not the sunbathers.
00:51:00.599,00:51:02.184,I meant it.
00:51:02.226,00:51:06.062,"Actually, if I'm gonna be completely honest with you, I was sleeping standing up."
00:51:06.104,00:51:08.983,I worked 36 hours straight.
00:51:10.066,00:51:11.485,How is a girl like you single?
00:51:11.527,00:51:12.361,Oh...
00:51:13.278,00:51:14.530,I have issues.
00:51:14.572,00:51:16.490,One might even call me damaged.
00:51:16.532,00:51:17.950,"Actually, one did call me damaged."
00:51:17.992,00:51:19.952,Get out of here.
00:51:19.994,00:51:21.913,I kind of believe in true love.
00:51:21.954,00:51:24.164,That there might be a Prince Charming out there for me.
00:51:25.875,00:51:27.001,Oh.
00:51:29.962,00:51:37.135,"Listen, I know this is probably a no because all you do is work like a dull boy, but if would you like to come get a beer?"
00:51:37.177,00:51:38.303,"Ah, I'm good."
00:51:38.345,00:51:40.347,"No, it's not a gay bar."
00:51:40.389,00:51:44.393,And there'll be just as many hot girls as hot guys.
00:51:45.978,00:51:48.689,You know what?
00:51:48.731,00:51:51.191,All right.
00:51:52.484,00:51:53.527,"You're still not gay, right?"
00:51:53.569,00:51:54.862,Nope.
00:52:00.952,00:52:02.244,What?
00:52:03.537,00:52:05.706,Date number five.
00:52:11.253,00:52:14.048,Wanna go in the bedroom?
00:52:20.304,00:52:22.514,I am so glad I met you tonight.
00:52:23.223,00:52:24.558,"Me, too."
00:52:28.604,00:52:30.272,What are you thinking?
00:52:31.356,00:52:33.484,Just how great you are.
00:52:45.203,00:52:46.747,"Annie, hey."
00:52:46.789,00:52:49.041,Who the fuck is Annie?
00:52:49.083,00:52:50.501,My sister.
00:52:50.542,00:52:52.336,Better be. I'll cut her.
00:52:54.880,00:52:56.632,Of course I'm coming.
00:52:56.674,00:53:00.552,"Yeah, I'm taking the 4th off, so I'll be there for three days."
00:53:11.355,00:53:12.898,Yeah. How's Dad?
00:53:13.482,00:53:15.609,Any worse?
00:53:15.651,00:53:17.193,"All right, tell him I said hi."
00:53:18.154,00:53:19.571,"Bye, Banannie."
00:53:23.367,00:53:25.577,I want you to meet my parents.
00:53:26.286,00:53:28.204,"No, you... Really?"
00:53:35.587,00:53:36.964,God!
00:53:39.091,00:53:58.234,"to take me home to take me home Hey. Hold on, hold on."
00:53:58.276,00:54:00.863,"No, just hold on."
00:54:00.905,00:54:03.365,I gotta go find a place to talk. Okay.
00:54:05.910,00:54:07.870,Shit. Shit.
00:54:07.912,00:54:09.245,"Oh, sorry."
00:54:09.287,00:54:11.373,I was out pretty late last night.
00:54:11.415,00:54:15.920,"When I got in, you and your girlfriend were on the couch so I just crashed in your bed."
00:54:15.961,00:54:17.755,He's not a girl.
00:54:17.796,00:54:20.174,You smelled him?
00:54:20.216,00:54:22.760,What did you say?
00:54:22.801,00:54:25.512,"I wanna do a campfire, like when you were little."
00:54:25.554,00:54:26.889,Okay.
00:54:26.931,00:54:29.850,And then we're gonna look for sticks.
00:54:29.892,00:54:32.853,And then we're gonna sing.
00:54:32.895,00:54:34.772,Just hold on a second.
00:54:35.731,00:54:36.982,Okay.
00:54:39.068,00:54:40.276,Okay.
00:54:45.323,00:54:46.658,What's up?
00:54:46.700,00:54:51.080,Do you think guys care more about global warming or how to wear white pants to a cookout?
00:54:51.122,00:54:52.706,"JAMIE: Well, that depends."
00:54:52.748,00:54:55.084,Do you have a hot model in a bikini standing on an icecap?
00:54:55.126,00:54:57.086,No. Ski slope.
00:54:57.128,00:54:58.921,I'd still go with pants to a cookout.
00:54:58.963,00:55:01.257,"Yeah, me, too."
00:55:01.297,00:55:04.218,How's your boy Parker?
00:55:04.260,00:55:06.553,Two coffees.
00:55:04.260,00:55:08.847,"Yeah, he's still looking up at trees, but, um, this time it's actually in my apartment."
00:55:08.889,00:55:11.225,It's the fifth date already?
00:55:11.267,00:55:14.228,Did you guys fifth-date?
00:55:14.270,00:55:16.605,How dare you!
00:55:16.647,00:55:17.731,I know.
00:55:21.610,00:55:24.155,Hey. I gotta go.
00:55:24.529,00:55:25.739,Okay.
00:55:25.781,00:55:27.158,JAMIE: Parker.
00:55:27.699,00:55:29.160,Hey.
00:55:29.201,00:55:30.744,Um...
00:55:30.786,00:55:33.956,I got us coffees.
00:55:33.998,00:55:35.624,I gotta get going.
00:55:35.666,00:55:37.084,I thought you weren't on call today.
00:55:37.126,00:55:40.254,"I'm not, but I got that thing..."
00:55:40.296,00:55:41.922,This...
00:55:43.924,00:55:46.260,Really?
00:55:46.302,00:55:49.387,The sneak-out.
00:55:49.429,00:55:51.765,I just...
00:55:51.807,00:55:53.976,I don't think I can be your Prince Charming.
00:55:54.018,00:55:56.728,"God, you totally didn't get anything that I was saying, did you?"
00:55:56.770,00:56:00.607,"No, no, no."
00:56:00.649,00:56:02.234,"Hey, you know what?"
00:56:02.276,00:56:04.195,Really?
00:56:15.331,00:56:17.041,DYLAN: Who sleeps standing up?
00:56:17.082,00:56:18.500,"You know, you'd be really proud of me."
00:56:18.542,00:56:20.585,I didn't even blink when I told him to go fuck himself.
00:56:20.627,00:56:24.589,"You did just then, though."
00:56:24.631,00:56:26.382,"I don't know, maybe I suck in bed."
00:56:26.424,00:56:27.592,"Trust me, you don't suck in bed."
00:56:28.510,00:56:30.470,Thank you.
00:56:30.512,00:56:32.306,"Hey, maybe the guy's married or something."
00:56:32.348,00:56:34.225,"No, did a background check at work."
00:56:34.266,00:56:37.435,"Single, no criminal history, credit report 720."
00:56:37.477,00:56:39.104,Background check.
00:56:39.146,00:56:41.523,How could you possibly max out an Old Navy card?
00:56:41.565,00:56:43.441,After college I was really into cargo pants.
00:56:45.401,00:56:47.321,"Dylan, I gotta stop thinking it's not me."
00:56:47.363,00:56:49.573,"I mean, it's gotta be me."
00:56:49.614,00:56:50.991,Nothing is wrong with you.
00:56:51.033,00:56:53.118,He's a guy.
00:56:51.033,00:56:55.495,"You gave him a five-date challenge, he got you and cut out."
00:56:55.537,00:56:57.831,He's a dick.
00:56:59.124,00:57:01.210,Go have fun with your mom.
00:57:01.252,00:57:04.255,Okay.
00:57:12.012,00:57:14.806,"It's Lieutenant Kali, the street artist we talked about."
00:57:14.848,00:57:17.976,I got him to do something for you. F-tale. Fairy tale.
00:57:18.018,00:57:21.021,"I know you're into that girly shit, so..."
00:57:22.314,00:57:24.400,"Dylan, that's actually really sweet."
00:57:24.482,00:57:26.235,"It's cool, right?"
00:57:28.279,00:57:31.115,"Hey, I'm gonna need to borrow cab fare."
00:57:31.156,00:57:33.075,I'm not taking that thing on the subway.
00:57:33.117,00:57:34.785,No problem.
00:57:34.826,00:57:36.412,As long as you get your feet off my bed.
00:57:38.747,00:57:39.998,What are you doing?
00:57:40.040,00:57:41.792,Why are you doing that?
00:57:41.833,00:57:43.460,You're an animal.
00:57:47.756,00:57:49.174,"Hey, Ma."
00:57:50.592,00:57:52.886,"Ma. Come on, we gotta get on the road."
00:57:53.387,00:57:54.721,Come on.
00:57:54.763,00:57:56.307,Ma?
00:58:13.073,00:58:15.075,Ouch.
00:58:15.117,00:58:17.035,Why did I think that this time would be any different?
00:58:17.077,00:58:18.954,Come with me to LA.
00:58:18.996,00:58:21.623,What else are you gonna do?
00:58:21.665,00:58:23.500,"You're very sweet for asking, but it's fine."
00:58:23.541,00:58:25.169,"You know what, I'll just stay here."
00:58:25.210,00:58:28.339,I know you'll be fine alone.
00:58:28.380,00:58:30.632,I'm actually asking you to come because it would help me.
00:58:30.674,00:58:32.384,You'd be a great distraction for my family.
00:58:32.426,00:58:34.552,They'd forget all about drilling me for being single.
00:58:34.594,00:58:35.971,Won't they think that we're together?
00:58:36.013,00:58:38.265,Not if I tell them we're not.
00:58:38.307,00:58:40.600,"Yeah, we're one of these crazy families that doesn't lie to each other."
00:58:40.642,00:58:42.227,PBS is doing a documentary on us.
00:58:42.269,00:58:43.728,"Come on, they'll love you."
00:58:43.770,00:58:45.897,"All fast-talking and brusque, like I'm bringing home a carny."
00:58:45.939,00:58:48.984,"You're really nice to ask, but I'm just gonna stay here."
00:58:49.026,00:58:50.694,Go to the gym.
00:58:50.735,00:58:53.530,"I just got you a ticket with my miles, it's done."
00:58:53.571,00:58:55.032,But...
00:58:55.073,00:58:57.742,Like you were gonna go to the gym.
00:59:11.298,00:59:13.008,LA's so nice.
00:59:13.050,00:59:15.511,Hmm.
00:59:17.179,00:59:20.307,Thanks for this.
00:59:20.349,00:59:22.100,"You're the good peeps, dude."
00:59:22.142,00:59:24.520,You haven't met my family.
00:59:26.230,00:59:28.023,Okay.
00:59:28.065,00:59:29.691,You know these planes pretty much land themselves?
00:59:29.733,00:59:32.569,Nobody cares.
00:59:34.112,00:59:35.447,She's from New York.
00:59:35.489,00:59:36.740,I'm sorry.
00:59:47.584,00:59:49.878,Wow. This looks normal.
00:59:49.920,00:59:51.088,It is.
00:59:51.922,00:59:53.090,Thank you.
00:59:57.344,00:59:59.888,"Wow, you grew up here?"
00:59:59.930,01:00:02.015,It was my grandfather's.
01:00:02.057,01:00:03.892,He bought it when there was nothing else here.
01:00:03.934,01:00:06.228,My dad and my sister and her son live here now.
01:00:06.270,01:00:09.773,Why would you move to New York?
01:00:09.814,01:00:12.234,I was conned by some headhunter.
01:00:12.276,01:00:13.944,You're here.
01:00:13.985,01:00:15.070,"Hey, Uncle Dylan."
01:00:15.112,01:00:16.238,"What's up, buddy?"
01:00:17.155,01:00:18.532,How are you?
01:00:18.574,01:00:21.493,"Jamie, this is my nephew, Sam the Magnificent."
01:00:21.535,01:00:24.204,Hello.
01:00:24.246,01:00:25.914,"I'm sorry, I don't smoke."
01:00:25.956,01:00:27.916,Just pretend.
01:00:27.958,01:00:30.627,Of course I'll have a cigarette.
01:00:33.922,01:00:38.260,"Wow. Thank you, good sir."
01:00:39.386,01:00:40.887,"Oh, my God."
01:00:40.929,01:00:42.931,"Sammy. I got it, I got it."
01:00:42.973,01:00:44.849,Sammy! Are you okay?
01:00:44.891,01:00:45.976,All part of the illusion.
01:00:46.017,01:00:47.644,Jet Skis later?
01:00:48.686,01:00:50.188,"DYLAN: Still into magic, huh?"
01:00:50.230,01:00:53.024,Yep. But I'll take that over him sexting his friends any day.
01:00:54.025,01:00:56.236,Dilbert!
01:00:57.488,01:01:00.115,"Jamie, this is my sister, Annie."
01:01:00.157,01:01:01.866,Hi.
01:01:01.908,01:01:03.660,"Oh, please."
01:01:03.701,01:01:05.496,We're just friends.
01:01:05.537,01:01:07.664,"If you were his girlfriend, he never would've brought you here."
01:01:07.705,01:01:10.334,This one has intimacy issues.
01:01:10.375,01:01:11.585,Dylan.
01:01:11.627,01:01:13.462,"Dylan. Oh, man."
01:01:13.504,01:01:15.755,"How you doing, buddy?"
01:01:15.797,01:01:17.841,"I miss you guys, but I'm good."
01:01:17.882,01:01:19.092,Oh!
01:01:19.134,01:01:20.594,Dede Spencer?
01:01:20.636,01:01:22.513,"Uh, Jamie. Dylan's friend."
01:01:24.681,01:01:26.642,Oh. I'm sorry. I...
01:01:26.683,01:01:28.726,"No, for a minute you reminded me of a girl I used to know."
01:01:28.768,01:01:31.188,"No, that's okay."
01:01:31.229,01:01:33.148,Pleasure meeting you.
01:01:33.190,01:01:34.983,Thank you.
01:01:35.025,01:01:37.694,"Pool's a little cold, but it's very expensive to heat, so..."
01:01:38.903,01:01:42.699,I think I'm gonna go in and check the tide tables 'cause I'm gonna take the boat out early in the morning.
01:01:42.740,01:01:44.201,You should come.
01:01:44.242,01:01:46.036,We sold the boat.
01:01:46.077,01:01:47.996,The doctor doesn't want you driving the boat anymore.
01:01:50.415,01:01:52.083,Turning to mush.
01:01:53.793,01:01:56.254,"It's good to see you, buddy."
01:01:56.296,01:01:57.881,Nice to meet you.
01:01:57.922,01:01:59.633,Jamie. See?
01:02:04.846,01:02:07.683,What's with the pants?
01:02:07.724,01:02:09.934,He's getting worse.
01:02:09.976,01:02:11.645,It's so good to have you here.
01:02:12.896,01:02:13.730,Go show her the beach.
01:02:15.524,01:02:17.693,Let me show you the beach. Come on.
01:02:17.734,01:02:20.320,"Go, get sandy."
01:02:36.002,01:02:38.129,JAMIE: Dylan never told me about your dad.
01:02:38.171,01:02:41.592,"Yeah, it's been tough on him."
01:02:41.633,01:02:43.301,Dylan doesn't quite know how to deal with the Alzheimer's.
01:02:43.343,01:02:44.928,I'm sorry.
01:02:44.969,01:02:49.891,"He'll be his regular old self and everything seems fine, and then just in a flash, he's gone."
01:02:52.060,01:02:55.021,That's Dylan when he was nine.
01:02:55.063,01:02:57.691,He was going through a Kris Kross phase.
01:03:03.113,01:03:06.991,Is that your mom?
01:03:07.033,01:03:09.953,He had a stutter.
01:03:09.994,01:03:11.788,He had a rough childhood.
01:03:11.829,01:03:14.916,His math tutor called it character-building.
01:03:14.958,01:03:18.795,"No, we're talking, like, eight times six equals 1,200."
01:03:18.836,01:03:20.922,"But he's very visual, thank God."
01:03:20.964,01:03:23.300,Can you please explain to me this photo?
01:03:23.341,01:03:25.510,That is my 12th-birthday surprise party.
01:03:25.552,01:03:27.804,Hey.
01:03:27.845,01:03:29.723,I'm exhausted.
01:03:29.765,01:03:33.101,"Jamie, you all good with your room?"
01:03:33.143,01:03:34.811,Thank you.
01:03:39.733,01:03:42.944,"Sammy and I built a saw-a-girl-in-half box, so just be careful on your way to bed."
01:03:42.986,01:03:44.571,"He's not using a real saw, is he?"
01:03:44.613,01:03:46.740,Of course he is.
01:03:46.782,01:03:50.076,"I'll make sure he brushes his teeth, and you, don't believe anything she says."
01:03:50.118,01:03:52.788,She's a liar.
01:03:52.829,01:03:54.914,He's a pretty special guy.
01:03:58.001,01:04:00.170,Jamie. Hey.
01:04:00.211,01:04:01.171,You up?
01:04:04.382,01:04:06.217,I thought you were going to bed.
01:04:06.259,01:04:08.804,"But then I realized we were both single again, so..."
01:04:09.471,01:04:10.388,Oopsy.
01:04:10.806,01:04:11.848,Oopsy.
01:04:12.474,01:04:14.267,"Dude, no."
01:04:14.309,01:04:16.436,I washed my hands.
01:04:16.478,01:04:18.605,Are you serious?
01:04:18.647,01:04:22.400,You cracked your neck on the porch. This thing.
01:04:22.442,01:04:30.826,"I cracked my neck because we were on a flight for six hours, and you were yapping my ear off about how planes all fly themselves, and it actually kinked my neck a bit."
01:04:30.867,01:04:33.787,"So, no?"
01:04:33.829,01:04:35.872,Is it your special time?
01:04:39.083,01:04:41.085,"Nope, you're good to go."
01:04:41.127,01:04:43.839,"Plus, I just got dumped, so..."
01:04:43.880,01:04:46.174,I thought this would be a good way to take your mind off him.
01:04:46.216,01:04:48.802,"No, I don't function that way."
01:04:48.844,01:04:51.095,But you know what will?
01:04:51.137,01:04:53.765,"Before we were sex without emotion, and now we're emotion without sex."
01:04:53.807,01:04:55.475,Exactly.
01:04:55.517,01:04:57.310,I just need you to be my friend right now.
01:04:57.352,01:04:59.771,Okay. So I'll listen to you while you give me a hand job.
01:04:59.813,01:05:02.566,No.
01:05:02.607,01:05:06.361,"Wait, hold on! Friends can still hang out and, I don't know, listen to music."
01:05:06.403,01:05:07.738,Listen to music?
01:05:09.531,01:05:11.658,I'm gonna kill Annie.
01:05:11.700,01:05:14.578,I can't believe you used to like them.
01:05:14.619,01:05:16.079,I don't even remember...
01:05:16.120,01:05:30.886,"to another bad little fad give you something that you never had Wiggle and shake your rump something that make you wanna jump 'Cause I'm just so fly And then there's something, I don't know what he says right there..."
01:05:33.221,01:05:36.099,Are you kidding me?
01:05:36.140,01:05:37.851,"Everybody had Girbauds, we all wore 'em backwards."
01:05:37.893,01:05:39.519,The baseball jerseys.
01:05:40.978,01:05:42.980,I went as Kris Kross three years in a row for Halloween.
01:05:43.022,01:05:45.358,"Oh, you poor kid."
01:05:45.400,01:05:48.904,"Hey, I borrowed one of your books."
01:05:52.365,01:05:53.742,Like this.
01:05:56.202,01:05:57.120,No.
01:06:05.962,01:06:06.963,Surprise!
01:06:11.050,01:06:14.387,Have you really never brought a girl home before?
01:06:14.429,01:06:16.264,I brought you here.
01:06:16.306,01:06:19.267,I mean like a real girl.
01:06:20.268,01:06:22.103,A real girl?
01:06:23.438,01:06:25.148,I guess not.
01:06:25.189,01:06:28.192,Separation of church and state.
01:06:28.234,01:06:31.613,Build up as many walls as possible.
01:06:31.655,01:06:33.782,"What, are you talking to me about walls?"
01:06:33.824,01:06:36.326,What about you and your mom?
01:06:36.367,01:06:39.370,You couldn't get me out of there fast enough when she walked in on us.
01:06:39.412,01:06:41.748,That was for your own protection. Okay?
01:06:41.790,01:06:45.543,I'm just surprised she didn't try to slip you her number or something.
01:06:45.585,01:06:47.754,She did.
01:06:47.796,01:06:50.173,Under MILF.
01:06:50.214,01:06:52.592,"It's cool, we only hooked up, like, twice."
01:06:54.344,01:06:56.721,I'm starting to get a mental image.
01:06:56.763,01:06:57.973,"Well, I have a video image."
01:06:58.014,01:07:01.017,Oh! No. Just stop it.
01:07:03.728,01:07:05.772,Just wrong.
01:07:09.233,01:07:10.193,What?
01:07:11.945,01:07:14.030,Nothing.
01:07:16.783,01:07:19.619,"Yeah, well, knowing you doesn't suck either."
01:07:37.637,01:07:40.640,But I thought you said...
01:07:55.572,01:07:56.656,Oopsy.
01:09:15.693,01:09:16.778,Ow!
01:09:17.821,01:09:18.905,God.
01:09:44.055,01:09:46.349,"Lasorda was a good pitcher, but he was an even better manager."
01:09:46.390,01:09:48.810,Wrecking Crew?
01:09:48.852,01:09:50.561,"He's underappreciated as a pitcher, that's all I'm saying."
01:09:50.603,01:09:51.813,We get it. Guys.
01:09:51.855,01:09:53.356,Hi.
01:09:53.397,01:09:57.401,Good morning.
01:09:57.443,01:10:00.321,"Well, in between the fires and the floods, we get about 10 good days."
01:10:00.363,01:10:03.116,Oh.
01:10:03.158,01:10:04.450,Are you sure?
01:10:04.492,01:10:05.660,"You don't have to do that, Dad."
01:10:05.702,01:10:07.203,I know.
01:10:07.244,01:10:09.330,I love that boat.
01:10:09.372,01:10:11.207,Oh. Here. Sorry.
01:10:11.541,01:10:12.625,Here.
01:10:13.668,01:10:16.212,Thank you. This... Okay.
01:10:17.964,01:10:19.883,"Coffee, my lady?"
01:10:20.842,01:10:22.218,Thank you.
01:10:22.802,01:10:24.012,Woah!
01:10:24.054,01:10:26.973,"All right, man!"
01:10:27.015,01:10:29.976,That's pretty impressive.
01:10:30.018,01:10:32.145,DYLAN: All right!
01:10:32.187,01:10:35.857,"Oh. Oh, buddy."
01:10:35.899,01:10:37.067,Apologies.
01:10:41.654,01:10:42.906,Here.
01:10:47.577,01:10:49.204,You okay?
01:10:50.080,01:10:51.414,You?
01:11:04.052,01:11:07.097,"See them, Sammy?"
01:11:08.056,01:11:10.058,"Pretty cool, huh?"
01:11:10.934,01:11:13.186,"God, it's nice."
01:11:13.228,01:11:17.356,"I do miss the mornings out here. Right before it burns off, it really is beautiful."
01:11:17.398,01:11:18.482,I like Jamie.
01:11:21.236,01:11:23.446,"And she's pretty, too."
01:11:23.487,01:11:26.449,"Hey, easy, dude."
01:11:26.490,01:11:30.661,"I'm a magician, not a wizard."
01:11:30.703,01:11:32.914,You can't deny that going to Hogwarts wouldn't be life-changing.
01:11:34.207,01:11:37.543,I miss you.
01:11:37.585,01:11:40.296,Mom misses you.
01:11:42.423,01:11:44.050,Does he say anything?
01:11:44.092,01:11:46.636,No. But sometimes he calls me Dylan.
01:11:49.764,01:11:51.474,He said that he didn't want the job.
01:11:51.515,01:11:54.310,That he was just coming to New York to explore his options.
01:11:54.351,01:11:56.562,What a crock of gas.
01:11:56.604,01:11:58.773,You fly across the country to explore your options?
01:11:58.815,01:12:00.399,Please. I don't think so.
01:12:00.441,01:12:04.028,"Exactly! Please, I knew I had him the second he got off that plane."
01:12:04.070,01:12:05.738,"Oh, did you, now?"
01:12:05.780,01:12:10.034,Was that the same second you leapt onto the baggage carousel barefoot and acted out a scene from Will and Grace?
01:12:10.076,01:12:11.995,She did?
01:12:12.036,01:12:13.370,"Ah, look at me, I'm goofy but cute."
01:12:13.412,01:12:14.872,You know what?
01:12:14.914,01:12:16.415,Quite a plan.
01:12:16.457,01:12:17.959,Did you major in Planning at Headhunting College?
01:12:18.001,01:12:20.503,So clever.
01:12:20.544,01:12:23.714,You guys bicker like you're an old married couple.
01:12:23.756,01:12:24.882,"Here, pick a card, my lady."
01:12:24.924,01:12:26.342,Okay.
01:12:26.383,01:12:28.303,"Oh, no, not that one."
01:12:28.344,01:12:30.638,This is a good one.
01:12:30.680,01:12:32.140,Yeah?
01:12:32.182,01:12:34.558,Did you get her an engagement gift?
01:12:34.600,01:12:37.145,"We're not engaged, Dad."
01:12:37.187,01:12:41.107,"All right, you don't wanna label it. I understand."
01:12:42.399,01:12:43.985,The only thing your mom loves is jewelry.
01:12:44.027,01:12:47.530,"I don't care how upset she is, I get her jewelry, she lights right up."
01:12:47.571,01:12:50.158,"Where is she, anyway?"
01:12:50.200,01:12:53.203,"She's not here, Dad."
01:12:55.579,01:12:58.457,She's not coming.
01:12:58.499,01:13:01.794,"She doesn't live with you anymore, Pop."
01:13:01.836,01:13:04.463,MR. HARPER: What?
01:13:04.505,01:13:05.965,I don't understand.
01:13:06.007,01:13:07.800,"She divorced you, Dad."
01:13:11.221,01:13:12.429,I have to call her.
01:13:12.471,01:13:13.931,Stop telling me what to do.
01:13:15.225,01:13:17.393,Get your...
01:13:20.355,01:13:21.898,SAM: Grandpa!
01:13:21.939,01:13:23.440,"ANNIE: Dylan, get..."
01:13:23.482,01:13:24.734,"DYLAN: You okay, Dad?"
01:13:24.775,01:13:27.195,"Here, let me help you up."
01:13:59.435,01:14:00.811,Here we are.
01:14:01.938,01:14:04.607,This is beautiful.
01:14:04.648,01:14:07.360,"Yeah, this is where I used to come to think. My rooftop."
01:14:07.402,01:14:08.986,"Okay, how high do you think that fence is?"
01:14:09.028,01:14:10.738,I'm a little over 6 foot.
01:14:10.780,01:14:13.699,Looks like it's about three of me.
01:14:14.992,01:14:17.161,Ninety-two feet.
01:14:17.203,01:14:21.665,Ninety-two feet.
01:14:21.707,01:14:25.086,"But they don't want you to get up there, so I guess that makes sense."
01:14:25.128,01:14:28.589,Wait. Six times three...
01:14:29.673,01:14:32.051,What's up?
01:14:32.093,01:14:34.262,What? What?
01:14:34.304,01:14:37.014,"Jamie, no, no, no, no, no, wait. They take this shit seriously, okay?"
01:14:37.056,01:14:38.724,Look at all the cameras.
01:14:38.766,01:14:41.727,This is the only landmark this city has other than the Scientology Center.
01:14:41.769,01:14:46.649,"And if any of these cameras are hooked up to the actual Scientology Center, that was an inappropriate joke and I apologize."
01:14:46.690,01:14:49.152,I believe in the freedom of science fiction.
01:14:50.694,01:14:52.405,"Pussy! Oh, sorry."
01:14:52.447,01:14:53.489,Pussy!
01:14:53.823,01:14:54.824,Come on!
01:15:01.456,01:15:04.250,JAMIE: You really never been up here before?
01:15:04.292,01:15:08.921,"I've also never transferred heroin in my rectum, 'cause it's against the law."
01:15:08.963,01:15:12.842,"You know, sometimes a simple yes or no answer is adequate."
01:15:12.883,01:15:15.052,"Hey, why didn't you tell me about your mom?"
01:15:15.094,01:15:16.846,She's not worth talking about.
01:15:17.680,01:15:19.056,That's rough.
01:15:19.098,01:15:20.350,So is leaving your husband and kids.
01:15:21.642,01:15:23.894,"Yeah, you never told me about him either."
01:15:23.936,01:15:25.729,"You know, there's a lot of stuff you didn't tell me."
01:15:25.771,01:15:27.190,I don't want your pity.
01:15:28.941,01:15:32.487,I can handle anything except that look in people's eyes.
01:15:34.947,01:15:38.493,That one.
01:15:38.534,01:15:39.785,He's the smartest man I've ever known.
01:15:39.827,01:15:41.871,He's the only person I'd ever go to for advice.
01:15:41.912,01:15:43.373,He's my dad.
01:15:43.414,01:15:44.665,"Dylan, he's still the same man."
01:15:44.707,01:15:46.292,When I see the way people look at him now...
01:15:46.334,01:15:49.545,It doesn't matter how people look at him.
01:15:49.586,01:15:51.214,All that matters is how you look at him.
01:15:51.255,01:15:53.757,"Yeah, but he's walking around without his pants."
01:15:53.799,01:15:55.592,So what?
01:15:55.634,01:15:57.303,He needs to know that nothing has changed.
01:15:57.345,01:15:59.305,That he's still that same man to you.
01:15:59.347,01:16:01.140,Can we stop talking about this?
01:16:03.059,01:16:06.062,"Yeah, that's really smart."
01:16:06.103,01:16:07.146,I'm trying not to.
01:16:09.357,01:16:12.609,Come on. Is something going on here? You've been acting really weird.
01:16:12.651,01:16:15.029,"No, I haven't."
01:16:15.071,01:16:16.531,Is this about what happened the other night?
01:16:16.572,01:16:18.449,"What, sex?"
01:16:21.785,01:16:22.870,Right.
01:16:22.912,01:16:24.914,And I haven't been acting weird.
01:16:26.707,01:16:29.377,"Oh, my God!"
01:16:29.419,01:16:31.128,I told you!
01:16:31.170,01:16:33.214,Fuck!
01:16:33.256,01:16:35.508,OFFICER: This is the LAPD.
01:16:35.550,01:16:36.592,We gotta jump.
01:16:38.761,01:16:41.138,"JAMIE: Dylan, jump!"
01:16:41.180,01:16:42.473,"Come on, get down!"
01:16:42.515,01:16:43.682,"Sir, this is your last warning."
01:16:43.724,01:16:46.185,Use the ladder!
01:16:46.227,01:16:50.814,And also helicopters!
01:16:50.856,01:16:53.568,What do you mean you have a fear of heights?
01:16:53.650,01:16:55.236,Why would you come up here?
01:16:55.278,01:17:02.618,You called me NEWS ANCHOR: A bizarre situation this afternoon in the Southland.
01:17:02.659,01:17:08.291,"The LAPD rescued a local man from the Hollywood sign, the city's only real landmark."
01:17:08.332,01:17:10.626,They actually wrapped you in a foil blanket!
01:17:10.667,01:17:12.253,Did you run a marathon before this?
01:17:12.295,01:17:14.130,Okay. Give me...
01:17:14.171,01:17:16.340,"No, no. I wanna save it."
01:17:16.382,01:17:18.551,Give me the remote! Shut up!
01:17:18.593,01:17:20.344,"Ow, ow, ow!"
01:17:20.386,01:17:21.471,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
01:17:22.513,01:17:24.181,"It's okay, it'll be up on YouTube."
01:17:25.724,01:17:29.437,"Hey, you're still good to take Dad that week I have to go to DC for Sam's class trip, right?"
01:17:29.479,01:17:32.773,"Yeah, he's gonna stay with me in New York."
01:17:32.815,01:17:35.610,"So, when are we gonna see Jamie again?"
01:17:35.692,01:17:37.278,I don't know.
01:17:37.320,01:17:39.863,What's your problem?
01:17:39.905,01:17:41.865,She's not my girlfriend.
01:17:41.907,01:17:44.243,I would believe you if you didn't lie to me.
01:17:44.285,01:17:46.496,I saw you creeping out of her room the other night.
01:17:46.537,01:17:48.789,"Like you had just had sex, if you know what I mean."
01:17:48.831,01:17:50.666,"Yes, I know what you mean, you just said it."
01:17:50.707,01:17:53.043,And how do you know what I look like after I have...
01:17:53.085,01:17:56.631,"I'm not talking to you about this, okay?"
01:17:56.672,01:17:58.924,Dylan.
01:17:58.966,01:18:00.009,Dylan.
01:18:01.969,01:18:03.346,Forgot my saw.
01:18:06.015,01:18:08.767,I'll wait here.
01:18:08.809,01:18:11.937,Friends who have sex?
01:18:11.979,01:18:13.939,"It doesn't matter, it's over."
01:18:13.981,01:18:15.983,Because we don't like each other like that.
01:18:16.025,01:18:19.069,"Okay, you know what?"
01:18:19.111,01:18:20.655,What more are you looking for?
01:18:20.696,01:18:22.615,Who says I'm looking for anything?
01:18:22.657,01:18:24.450,"I don't know, but it's not Jamie."
01:18:24.492,01:18:26.243,"Why, because you're great together?"
01:18:26.285,01:18:27.953,Because you're actually friends with each other?
01:18:27.995,01:18:30.456,Because this is the happiest I have ever seen you?
01:18:30.498,01:18:31.790,I don't know what to tell you.
01:18:31.832,01:18:33.501,She's not for me.
01:18:33.543,01:18:34.960,You liked her enough to have sex with her.
01:18:35.002,01:18:36.086,It's just physical.
01:18:36.837,01:18:38.047,Like playing tennis.
01:18:38.088,01:18:40.174,"I don't even know what that means, Dylan."
01:18:40.216,01:18:42.759,I haven't seen you this dumb since you got that candy corn tattoo.
01:18:42.801,01:18:45.137,It's a lightning bolt!
01:18:45.179,01:18:47.181,"Dylan, you can't name one thing that's wrong with her."
01:18:47.223,01:18:48.932,I can never go out with her.
01:18:48.974,01:18:50.560,She's too fucked up.
01:18:50.601,01:18:53.896,"Okay, she doesn't want a boyfriend."
01:18:53.937,01:18:55.856,Magnum P.I. couldn't solve the shit going on in her head.
01:18:55.898,01:19:00.069,Wow. You'll say anything right now not to admit that you're perfect for each other.
01:19:00.110,01:19:01.654,Why am I still having this conversation?
01:19:01.696,01:19:03.322,"Good talk, Annie."
01:19:23.759,01:19:26.011,I don't think the three-point line would have done anything.
01:19:26.053,01:19:27.846,He was taller than anyone alive.
01:19:27.888,01:19:29.306,Kobe Bryant is incredible.
01:19:29.348,01:19:31.100,You're men.
01:19:31.141,01:19:32.685,Scored 81 points. Please.
01:19:32.727,01:19:34.895,Hey! We were waiting for you.
01:19:34.937,01:19:36.480,I actually got a call from work.
01:19:36.522,01:19:38.315,I have to be on a red eye tonight back to New York.
01:19:38.357,01:19:40.317,Tonight?
01:19:40.359,01:19:42.653,Tomorrow's the 4th.
01:19:42.695,01:19:44.280,"Well, at least let me drive you to the airport."
01:19:44.321,01:19:46.949,"No, no. It's fine. Stay."
01:19:46.990,01:19:49.285,But thank you guys for everything.
01:19:49.326,01:19:51.787,And thank you for letting me stay here.
01:19:55.249,01:19:56.709,Hey.
01:19:56.751,01:19:59.378,"Everything okay, buddy?"
01:19:59.420,01:20:01.088,I just really gotta go.
01:20:01.130,01:20:04.759,"So, um, thank you again."
01:20:04.800,01:20:06.802,Let Dylan drive you.
01:20:06.843,01:20:08.178,ANNIE: Do you wanna take some food to go?
01:20:08.220,01:20:09.805,SAM: Do you want me to saw you in half?
01:20:09.846,01:20:12.933,You can send your bottom part to New York and your top half can stay here.
01:20:14.477,01:20:17.480,Or the whole of you could stay.
01:20:17.521,01:20:19.022,"Okay, I'm sorry."
01:20:25.362,01:20:26.447,Ah...
01:20:31.452,01:20:32.828,DYLAN: Jamie!
01:20:40.670,01:20:42.838,She's gone.
01:20:50.387,01:20:51.930,We should eat.
01:20:51.972,01:20:53.056,Yeah.
01:20:53.098,01:20:55.434,Okay. Hand me your plate.
01:21:25.881,01:21:29.092,"Hey, bro. You hungry?"
01:21:29.134,01:21:31.970,"Thanks, man."
01:21:32.012,01:21:37.643,A work ethic. I love it.
01:21:37.685,01:21:41.605,"Well, behind Germany and France and Belgium and Japan and China and..."
01:21:41.647,01:21:43.482,Thank God for Bangladesh.
01:21:45.150,01:21:48.320,"Oh, by the way, why did you take your door off its lovely hinges?"
01:21:48.362,01:21:50.947,"It was dumb, man."
01:21:50.989,01:21:54.702,"Oh, right, right."
01:21:54.744,01:21:56.620,He took doors off of things.
01:21:56.662,01:21:58.706,"Hey, everybody wants a shortcut in life."
01:21:58.748,01:22:01.500,My guidebook is very simple.
01:22:01.542,01:22:02.877,"Stop eating, fatty."
01:22:02.918,01:22:04.127,You wanna make money?
01:22:04.169,01:22:06.296,"Work your ass off, lazy."
01:22:06.338,01:22:07.464,You wanna be happy?
01:22:07.506,01:22:10.008,Find someone you like and never let him go.
01:22:10.050,01:22:12.928,"Or her, if you're into that kind of creepy shit."
01:22:25.900,01:22:27.025,"Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis."
01:22:27.067,01:22:30.905,"I can't pick up the phone right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back."
01:22:38.203,01:22:40.080,"Mom, Mom, you gotta point it at the screen."
01:22:40.122,01:22:41.832,You gotta tell it where you are.
01:22:41.874,01:22:44.960,Fine. I'm over here pouring myself a drink.
01:22:49.381,01:22:52.718,Oh. Booty call.
01:22:52.760,01:22:55.429,"No, no."
01:22:55.471,01:22:57.848,This is your apartment.
01:23:00.100,01:23:02.102,"That's Dylan, right?"
01:23:02.144,01:23:04.187,He seemed pretty great.
01:23:04.229,01:23:06.273,"Well, that's more than anybody else you've dated."
01:23:06.315,01:23:08.984,"I don't know, you think maybe I keep my worlds apart for some crazy reason?"
01:23:20.370,01:23:23.833,I am an asshole.
01:23:23.874,01:23:26.710,We're looking for someone to lead the redesign of our entire website.
01:23:26.752,01:23:28.587,Someone to turn it completely upside down.
01:23:28.629,01:23:30.297,But you can't tell me what company you work for?
01:23:30.339,01:23:33.008,"Uh, for confidentiality reasons, uh, no."
01:23:33.049,01:23:34.259,Can you give me a hint?
01:23:34.301,01:23:38.472,We may or may not be the largest seller of purchased goods on the Internet.
01:23:38.514,01:23:41.308,"And by purchased goods, I mean books."
01:23:41.350,01:23:43.769,"You just placed the new art director over at GQ, right?"
01:23:43.811,01:23:45.061,"Uh, yeah."
01:23:45.103,01:23:46.355,That's the type of guy we want.
01:23:46.396,01:23:48.148,"Shoot, that's the guy we want."
01:23:48.190,01:23:50.025,Can you get him to come out to us?
01:23:50.066,01:23:52.528,No longer have a relationship with him.
01:23:52.569,01:23:53.779,Can you get to him?
01:23:53.821,01:23:58.241,"He's still in the first year of his contract, so that would be inappropriate."
01:23:58.283,01:24:01.244,"So is paying full price for a book at Barnes &amp; Noble, but people do dumb shit."
01:24:05.123,01:24:06.291,"Hi, you've reached Jamie Rellis."
01:24:06.333,01:24:09.962,"I can't pick up the phone right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back."
01:24:10.004,01:24:12.798,"Wow, right to voice mail."
01:24:25.143,01:24:26.186,Jamie.
01:24:28.355,01:24:30.065,How'd you know I was up here?
01:24:32.067,01:24:33.652,Only place in the city you don't get reception.
01:24:33.694,01:24:35.153,Right.
01:24:35.195,01:24:36.363,Why are you avoiding me?
01:24:36.405,01:24:37.698,I'm not.
01:24:37.740,01:24:39.867,"Really? Come on, Jamie."
01:24:39.909,01:24:44.538,"Well, Dylan, I don't know if you've heard, but I am seriously fucked up."
01:24:44.580,01:24:47.666,"I mean, Magnum P.I."
01:24:49.501,01:24:50.669,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry."
01:24:50.711,01:24:55.883,"But I'm just gonna go and try to fix the shit going on up in my head, if that's even possible."
01:24:55.925,01:24:59.553,I shouldn't have said that.
01:24:59.595,01:25:00.679,She thought we liked each other.
01:25:00.721,01:25:01.847,"Yeah, me, too, Dylan."
01:25:01.889,01:25:03.265,I thought we were friends.
01:25:03.306,01:25:09.229,"But friends don't go talking shit about each other, which must mean that you and I were actually never friends."
01:25:09.271,01:25:12.190,That all you wanted was to get in my pants.
01:25:12.232,01:25:14.860,What?
01:25:14.902,01:25:16.528,You cracked your neck.
01:25:16.570,01:25:18.321,I thought you were giving me a sign.
01:25:18.363,01:25:19.865,"Oh, my God, really?"
01:25:19.907,01:25:22.158,You pulled my robe off.
01:25:22.200,01:25:24.453,Yeah. And then you snuck out of the room.
01:25:24.494,01:25:26.622,Oopsy. Remember that?
01:25:26.663,01:25:30.042,Are you pissed off at me because I didn't cuddle?
01:25:31.877,01:25:35.631,Isn't that why we started this whole arrangement in the first place?
01:25:35.672,01:25:36.757,You wanted this.
01:25:39.969,01:25:41.470,I wanted this?
01:25:42.554,01:25:44.264,Just me?
01:25:44.306,01:25:47.768,"God, you are just like every other guy."
01:25:47.810,01:25:50.604,"The sad thing is, Dylan, I actually thought you were different."
01:25:50.646,01:25:53.732,Different from what?
01:25:53.774,01:25:55.734,"Well, with friends like you, who needs friends?"
01:25:58.654,01:26:02.950,"And, uh, thank you for ruining my mountaintop."
01:26:03.742,01:26:05.160,Asshole.
01:26:12.084,01:26:14.003,"Hey, man, you can't be up here."
01:26:14.837,01:26:16.379,Okay.
01:26:16.421,01:26:17.673,You okay?
01:26:17.714,01:26:19.008,I'm fine.
01:26:45.784,01:26:47.911,"Bryce, is this for me?"
01:26:47.953,01:26:50.873,Yeah. And so is this.
01:26:50.914,01:26:53.750,"Madison, will you marry me?"
01:26:53.792,01:26:55.460,"You bet your ass, Flapjack!"
01:26:57.754,01:26:58.964,I love New York.
01:26:59.006,01:27:00.966,I love you.
01:27:01.008,01:27:02.801,"Oh, my God. Look, the Empire State Building."
01:27:02.843,01:27:04.178,Wow.
01:27:04.219,01:27:06.013,"Oh, look, the Statue of Liberty."
01:27:13.103,01:27:14.396,"Hello, this is Jamie."
01:27:16.398,01:27:18.233,What do you mean they went to him directly?
01:27:19.359,01:27:21.153,"Well, is he gonna take it?"
01:27:21.195,01:27:23.613,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:27:24.239,01:27:25.240,Okay.
01:27:29.285,01:27:30.537,"Hey, this is Dylan."
01:27:30.579,01:27:31.621,Argh.
01:27:39.254,01:27:41.173,Excuse me. May I help you?
01:27:41.215,01:27:43.299,"Oh, hi. Um, where's Dylan Harper?"
01:27:43.341,01:27:45.635,He's at a photo shoot for the sports issue.
01:27:45.677,01:27:48.931,That's right. The photo shoot.
01:27:48.972,01:27:50.057,I'm sorry.
01:27:50.807,01:27:52.601,One of the models.
01:27:52.642,01:27:55.437,I have the perfect body for Photoshop.
01:27:55.478,01:28:00.567,"Yeah, this gets more angular, these get longer, and this gets way more Christian."
01:28:00.609,01:28:01.860,Mmm-hmm.
01:28:01.902,01:28:03.904,So where did you say he was again?
01:28:05.072,01:28:08.617,"Sports is the last chance we have of bringing our world together, bro."
01:28:08.658,01:28:14.164,"So I just wanted to shoot some photos that speak to that, to the unification of all people through sports."
01:28:14.206,01:28:16.166,"PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay, guys."
01:28:16.208,01:28:19.377,TOMMY: That's it.
01:28:19.419,01:28:23.673,"Okay, now put your arms around each other, like you like each other, like you love each other."
01:28:23.715,01:28:26.135,Too gay?
01:28:26.176,01:28:28.428,Throw some girls in there.
01:28:28.470,01:28:30.680,"Come on, ladies. Hop to."
01:28:32.515,01:28:36.186,"Girls, girls."
01:28:36.228,01:28:38.396,"Okay, let's go boy, girl, boy..."
01:28:38.438,01:28:41.275,Dylan.
01:28:41.316,01:28:43.068,What are you doing here?
01:28:43.110,01:28:44.486,"What, are you gonna leave now?"
01:28:44.527,01:28:45.904,"I don't know. Yeah, I took one meeting."
01:28:45.946,01:28:47.072,I can't believe you.
01:28:47.114,01:28:49.574,Come here.
01:28:49.616,01:28:51.701,Is this your way of getting back at me?
01:28:51.743,01:28:53.328,"You know that if you leave before a year is up, I get screwed."
01:28:53.787,01:28:55.413,"Oh, right."
01:28:55.455,01:29:01.336,"If I did leave, which I don't know yet because all I did was take one meeting, I'd write you a check for your bonus."
01:29:02.963,01:29:05.507,"Whatever it is, I'll pay for it."
01:29:05.548,01:29:06.633,Why didn't you tell me you were looking?
01:29:06.675,01:29:07.801,That's personal.
01:29:07.843,01:29:09.178,And we're not friends anymore.
01:29:09.219,01:29:10.345,You made that pretty clear.
01:29:11.721,01:29:15.976,"See, all I wanted to do was have sex with you."
01:29:16.018,01:29:17.727,Pretend you were the best friend I'd ever had.
01:29:17.769,01:29:19.855,Open up to you like I've never done with anyone ever.
01:29:19.896,01:29:26.195,"And then when the sex stopped, invite you to LA for the weekend to, introduce you to my family."
01:29:27.863,01:29:28.947,I'll send you a check if I take the job.
01:29:28.989,01:29:30.157,Don't bother.
01:29:35.370,01:29:37.747,TOMMY: Why don't you pick him up?
01:29:37.789,01:29:40.583,Yeah. Just pick him on up.
01:29:40.625,01:29:42.502,"Oh, you little Christ figure, you!"
01:30:06.776,01:30:08.278,"Hey, Dyl."
01:30:08.320,01:30:09.321,"Dad's coming into Newark Airport, right?"
01:30:09.363,01:30:11.405,"Yeah, he leaves at 9:00 our time."
01:30:11.447,01:30:13.992,9:00.
01:30:11.447,01:30:17.162,"So it's a five-hour flight, three-hour time difference, so he gets in at 32:00?"
01:30:17.204,01:30:19.998,5:00.
01:30:20.040,01:30:22.042,Right. How is Dad?
01:30:22.376,01:30:23.835,Ah.
01:30:23.877,01:30:26.588,He's lost more often than not now.
01:30:26.629,01:30:29.383,But then he has these moments of real clarity.
01:30:29.423,01:30:30.466,Okay.
01:30:33.178,01:30:34.930,That's over.
01:30:34.971,01:30:36.098,"Okay, we're done."
01:30:36.139,01:30:37.933,"Don't be an idiot, please."
01:30:37.974,01:30:40.394,"Thank you, Annie."
01:30:40.434,01:30:42.187,32:00 sharp.
01:30:45.982,01:30:47.609,JAMIE: I don't know what it is.
01:30:47.650,01:30:51.321,"I just can't get myself to start looking for a replacement for him, assuming that he leaves."
01:30:51.363,01:30:52.906,Do you want some motherly love advice?
01:30:53.447,01:30:54.574,Not really.
01:30:54.616,01:30:56.492,"Oh, good, 'cause I don't know how to do that."
01:30:56.534,01:31:02.832,What I do know is that it's no great goddamn secret you live in fear of repeating my mistakes.
01:31:02.874,01:31:05.252,"And you're not wrong, so learn from me."
01:31:05.294,01:31:08.213,Do you know how many men in my life I thought were really perfect?
01:31:08.255,01:31:09.589,Eighty.
01:31:09.631,01:31:11.465,Eighty-one?
01:31:11.507,01:31:14.094,Oh.
01:31:14.136,01:31:15.762,Obviously. Look at you.
01:31:15.804,01:31:19.266,"How smart you are, how great, how funny, how driven."
01:31:19.308,01:31:20.516,Your vaguely Middle Eastern beauty.
01:31:20.558,01:31:22.852,Sure as hell didn't all come from me.
01:31:23.686,01:31:28.400,"Okay, but, seriously, Mom, do you really not remember where my dad's from?"
01:31:28.442,01:31:29.985,Or is it like a coping mechanism?
01:31:30.026,01:31:31.069,A little of both.
01:31:31.111,01:31:32.362,Okay.
01:31:32.404,01:31:34.072,But I'm pretty sure he's Eurasian.
01:31:35.698,01:31:39.661,"I mean, we all have our Prince Charming, you just gotta know him when you see him."
01:31:39.702,01:31:42.164,"Mom, it's Prince Charming."
01:31:42.205,01:31:45.292,"Well, your Prince Charming isn't coming to rescue you in a horse and carriage."
01:31:45.334,01:31:47.210,That's not who you want.
01:31:47.252,01:31:50.964,"I mean, you're looking for a man to be your partner."
01:31:52.132,01:31:53.842,To take on the world with.
01:31:53.883,01:31:56.136,"You gotta update your fairy tale, baby."
01:31:57.137,01:31:58.930,My Prince Charming?
01:31:59.764,01:32:01.099,You.
01:32:01.141,01:32:02.309,Mom.
01:32:24.373,01:32:25.539,Hey.
01:32:25.581,01:32:27.167,A wheelchair.
01:32:28.418,01:32:30.086,How was the flight?
01:32:30.128,01:32:31.796,You know they don't serve food in coach anymore?
01:32:31.838,01:32:36.801,"You'd think with these new planes, they practically fly themselves, they could get rid of a pilot and use his salary for a hot lunch."
01:32:36.843,01:32:37.969,"I know, right?"
01:32:38.011,01:32:39.846,God.
01:32:39.888,01:32:42.140,DYLAN: The engineering on these planes is so advanced.
01:32:42.182,01:32:43.475,Completely computerized.
01:32:43.517,01:32:45.727,It's like playing a video game.
01:32:45.768,01:32:48.438,God. How long have we been waiting here?
01:32:48.480,01:32:50.564,"I'll be right back, okay?"
01:32:53.485,01:32:55.695,Excuse me.
01:32:55.737,01:32:57.447,Harper.
01:32:57.489,01:32:59.115,I have to seat people in the order they came.
01:32:59.157,01:33:03.203,"I totally understand that, but I'm with my dad and he's not in the best shape."
01:33:03.245,01:33:05.414,"Is there no way we could, like, squeeze a table?"
01:33:05.455,01:33:07.623,"No, I gotta go by the list. Sorry."
01:33:11.711,01:33:12.712,Dad?
01:33:19.761,01:33:20.762,Dad?
01:33:22.180,01:33:23.597,Shit. Dad?
01:33:36.445,01:33:37.737,You gonna join me?
01:33:47.663,01:33:49.207,Absolutely.
01:33:54.087,01:33:55.797,"Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry, you cannot do this."
01:33:55.838,01:33:58.007,"Could I get a steak, medium, please?"
01:33:58.049,01:33:59.968,"Sir, this is the Daily Grill."
01:34:09.185,01:34:10.644,Dede? Dede!
01:34:19.653,01:34:20.654,Dad.
01:34:21.156,01:34:22.824,Dad.
01:34:26.369,01:34:28.497,Who is Dede?
01:34:28.538,01:34:32.666,Jesus. She's just a girl that I met in the Navy.
01:34:33.709,01:34:35.128,Was...
01:34:37.631,01:34:39.132,She was the love of my life.
01:34:40.842,01:34:41.675,Okay?
01:34:42.969,01:34:44.678,Why didn't you tell me about her before?
01:34:44.720,01:34:47.432,This is not something you discuss with your children.
01:34:47.474,01:34:50.268,"And besides, I have you and Annie."
01:34:50.310,01:34:51.353,So tell me now.
01:34:53.647,01:34:55.148,She was the love of my life.
01:34:55.190,01:35:00.487,"And I was too stupid to realize it, and I lost her because of something so dumb I don't even remember."
01:35:00.529,01:35:02.364,And I never really got over her.
01:35:02.405,01:35:05.825,And I think that may be one of the reasons your mom left.
01:35:07.494,01:35:12.207,"You know, my friends used to say that when Dede and I looked at each other, it was electric."
01:35:12.248,01:35:13.958,And I let her go.
01:35:14.000,01:35:15.544,I just let her go.
01:35:15.585,01:35:19.797,Because I was too damn proud to tell her how I really felt about her.
01:35:19.839,01:35:22.467,I'll tell you something that I wish I knew when I was your age.
01:35:22.509,01:35:24.386,"And I know you've heard a million times, life is short."
01:35:24.427,01:35:30.933,"But let me tell you something, what this is teaching me is that life is goddamn short and you can't waste a minute of it."
01:35:33.687,01:35:35.522,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
01:35:40.109,01:35:43.905,"The girl I brought home to LA, Jamie?"
01:35:43.946,01:35:45.574,"Yeah, what's going on with her?"
01:35:45.615,01:35:47.158,I think I messed it up.
01:35:47.200,01:35:49.035,Fix it.
01:35:49.077,01:35:51.287,Maybe she'll listen.
01:35:51.329,01:35:55.749,"If you think there's even a chance that she could be it, you fix it."
01:35:58.378,01:35:59.962,Did Annie put you up to this?
01:36:00.004,01:36:00.880,Who's Annie?
01:36:01.755,01:36:03.007,I'm kidding.
01:36:03.049,01:36:04.092,"What, I can't joke about this?"
01:36:05.385,01:36:06.760,"Jesus Christ, Dad."
01:36:06.802,01:36:07.761,I don't know what else to do.
01:36:09.805,01:36:11.391,Let's go.
01:36:11.433,01:36:13.560,You don't want to finish your steak?
01:36:13.602,01:36:14.936,We're eating in the goddamn airport.
01:36:14.977,01:36:16.812,I can leave the steak.
01:36:16.854,01:36:18.814,"Yeah, hey, this is Dylan Harper from GQ."
01:36:18.856,01:36:20.816,We met a few weeks ago at the...
01:36:20.858,01:36:23.570,"Right. Hey, can I ask you a huge favor?"
01:36:23.612,01:36:24.904,"Oh. I am so sorry, sir."
01:36:24.946,01:36:26.197,It's my fault.
01:36:26.239,01:36:27.990,You just scared me.
01:36:28.032,01:36:29.534,"Yeah, I'm good."
01:36:29.576,01:36:30.744,"Thanks, man."
01:36:30.784,01:36:32.161,All right.
01:36:32.203,01:36:33.329,"All right, thanks, man."
01:36:33.371,01:36:34.581,Oh.
01:36:34.623,01:36:36.332,You gotta be fucking kidding me.
01:36:36.374,01:36:38.460,"All right, let's dance, Clowny Brown."
01:36:38.501,01:36:39.586,What's your problem with me?
01:36:39.628,01:36:41.379,I saw you at that bar with Jamie.
01:36:41.421,01:36:45.675,How could such an awesome girl be with this over this?
01:36:45.717,01:36:48.886,I've been trying to take that little monkey to pound-town for years.
01:36:48.928,01:36:50.930,I'll tell her you say hello.
01:36:50.972,01:36:53.182,You missed a little.
01:36:53.224,01:36:54.850,Dylan! I got a cab.
01:36:54.892,01:36:58.896,"I ever run into you again, I'll crush your earlobes and make soup stock out of them."
01:36:58.938,01:37:00.982,You have a vivid imagination.
01:37:01.023,01:37:02.400,I'm gonna get in the cab now.
01:37:02.442,01:37:03.610,I'm gonna go make soup!
01:37:03.652,01:37:05.236,What's the matter with her?
01:37:09.616,01:37:12.868,God! I thought LA was bad.
01:37:12.910,01:37:14.078,Is there another way into the city?
01:37:24.673,01:37:26.924,"DYLAN: I owe you big time, Tommy."
01:37:26.966,01:37:31.887,You'll make it up to me.
01:37:31.929,01:37:36.184,Tonight's the Butterfly Ball.
01:37:36.225,01:37:37.352,"You okay, Dad?"
01:37:37.393,01:37:38.645,Are you kidding?
01:37:38.687,01:37:41.855,1937 Chris-Craft?
01:37:41.897,01:37:42.856,Nice.
01:37:45.234,01:37:47.696,"Yeah. Hi, this is Dylan."
01:37:47.737,01:37:50.532,Right.
01:37:55.161,01:37:57.747,My number.
01:37:57.789,01:38:01.167,"My friend Dave from across the hall, his oven broke, so he'll be using the kitchen."
01:38:01.209,01:38:03.877,Your friend Dave is here using the kitchen or watching me?
01:38:04.629,01:38:06.172,Go.
01:38:06.214,01:38:07.965,Holy...
01:38:08.007,01:38:10.051,How to wear white pants to a cookout.
01:38:10.092,01:38:12.886,Did you scoop the Times on this?
01:38:13.513,01:38:14.930,"All right, all right."
01:38:14.972,01:38:16.140,"Just say hello to her for me, will you?"
01:38:17.350,01:38:18.643,"See you, Dad."
01:38:19.477,01:38:20.562,"Thanks, man."
01:38:21.688,01:38:23.189,"Hi, Dave from across the hall."
01:38:23.231,01:38:27.861,"Hi, Mr. Harper."
01:38:27.943,01:38:30.446,And now we know why you're here.
01:38:30.488,01:38:34.242,"Mom, I'm over by the Lexington exit."
01:38:34.283,01:38:36.327,LORNA: I'm standing right by the guy in the tie.
01:38:36.369,01:38:38.246,There are a million guys in ties.
01:38:38.287,01:38:40.289,So look for the guy I'm standing next to.
01:38:40.331,01:38:43.125,Ugh. You never do what you say you're gonna do.
01:38:43.167,01:38:44.878,"Just hang on, baby."
01:38:49.215,01:38:50.174,What?
01:38:52.844,01:38:54.804,I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it after all.
01:38:54.846,01:38:57.056,Something came up.
01:38:57.098,01:38:59.933,I'll be on the stairs.
01:39:04.355,01:39:06.315,"Oh, my God."
01:39:06.357,01:39:07.692,"Have a great night, baby."
01:39:27.169,01:39:28.922,What is this?
01:39:28.962,01:39:31.965,"It's Closing Time, by the band Semisonic!"
01:39:32.007,01:39:34.176,It's not Third Eye Blind.
01:39:34.218,01:39:37.221,"No, no, no."
01:39:37.263,01:39:40.391,You said you wanted your life to be like a movie.
01:39:40.433,01:39:43.645,Sorry I had to use the real Grand Central instead of the fake one.
01:39:50.610,01:39:51.694,"Listen, Jamie, I'm..."
01:39:51.736,01:39:53.987,I'm having trouble hearing you!
01:39:54.029,01:39:56.031,"Yeah, I didn't really think this through."
01:39:56.073,01:39:59.744,I guess in the movies the guy pours his heart out and they put the music in later.
01:39:59.786,01:40:00.994,What?
01:40:04.373,01:40:05.333,I messed up.
01:40:06.459,01:40:09.002,I was scared.
01:40:09.044,01:40:10.630,Look at what happened with my mom and my dad.
01:40:10.672,01:40:11.673,Of course I was scared.
01:40:12.882,01:40:14.007,So I ruined it.
01:40:15.217,01:40:21.474,"Everything that happens in the day, all I can think to myself is, I can't wait to tell Jamie about this."
01:40:21.516,01:40:25.227,"When I see someone cursing, all I picture is you blinking."
01:40:25.269,01:40:33.068,"And when I hear a kid's been cured of cancer, I pray it's not by that douchebag, tree-hugging fucking doctor who ran out on you."
01:40:33.110,01:40:37.239,"I mean, cancer being cured is awesome, but, you know, I wish someone else did it."
01:40:38.282,01:40:39.450,Come on.
01:40:44.539,01:40:46.958,"Hey, I miss you."
01:40:47.000,01:40:49.002,"Yeah, I miss you, too."
01:40:49.042,01:40:51.212,"But you're not wrong, I am damaged."
01:40:51.253,01:40:53.756,So am I. Who isn't?
01:40:53.798,01:40:55.675,That's what makes us so awesome.
01:40:55.717,01:40:57.218,And our tattoos.
01:40:59.512,01:41:01.014,"Oh. No, no, no."
01:41:01.054,01:41:02.682,"Oh, shut up."
01:41:02.724,01:41:05.018,"Jamie, will you be my best friend again?"
01:41:06.059,01:41:07.311,That is so lame.
01:41:07.353,01:41:08.187,Oh. I know.
01:41:09.647,01:41:11.273,"That's some Prince Charming shit, though, right?"
01:41:11.315,01:41:12.316,Get up.
01:41:14.318,01:41:17.613,"Look, I can live without ever having sex with you again."
01:41:17.655,01:41:18.698,It'd be really hard.
01:41:19.991,01:41:24.871,"Hey, I want my best friend back, because I'm in love with her."
01:41:25.705,01:41:26.998,Under one condition.
01:41:27.040,01:41:28.081,Anything.
01:41:30.083,01:41:31.210,Kiss me.
01:41:33.128,01:41:34.422,In public?
01:41:34.463,01:41:35.506,I did not ask you to...
01:41:55.234,01:41:56.945,You can all go home now.
01:42:03.492,01:42:05.327,Okay. So...
01:42:08.497,01:42:09.665,What do we do now?
01:42:09.707,01:42:10.499,Have our first date.
01:42:10.959,01:42:12.125,Okay.
01:42:15.421,01:42:18.173,"Oh, my God!"
01:42:19.467,01:42:21.594,"Yeah, that's not for you."
01:42:21.636,01:42:24.722,"Oh, thank God."
01:42:24.764,01:42:26.099,Really?
01:42:26.139,01:42:27.475,"DYLAN: So, where are you from?"
01:42:27.516,01:42:28.643,"Outside of Philly, actually."
01:42:28.684,01:42:30.185,Interesting.
01:42:30.227,01:42:32.271,"I'm from LA, just moved to New York."
01:42:32.313,01:42:33.940,Interesting.
01:42:33.982,01:42:37.568,"What? I'm excited, I'm on a first date. So..."
01:42:37.610,01:42:39.695,JAMIE: This isn't weird at all.
01:42:39.737,01:42:40.905,We're okay.
01:42:40.947,01:42:42.031,Yeah. Thank you.
01:42:44.366,01:42:45.910,So...
01:42:48.621,01:42:50.163,"Yeah, fuck it."
01:49:01.576,01:49:05.747,"Roll credits, roll credits, roll credits."
01:49:05.789,01:49:09.084,"Because if the actors had a good time making it, it must be good."
01:49:09.126,01:49:11.544,"You bet your ass, Jason."
01:49:11.586,01:49:13.047,"Oh, my God, I just called him Jason."
01:49:14.298,01:49:15.632,"Look, the crew's laughing."
01:49:15.674,01:49:16.758,Oh!
01:49:16.800,01:49:18.511,They made me do it!
01:49:20.179,01:49:21.930,It's my favorite part.
