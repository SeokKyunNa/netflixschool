00:02:19.347,00:02:21.433,"The poison is still fresh, three days."
00:02:21.516,00:02:24.686,They're following us.
00:02:24.770,00:02:28.231,"If they knew we were here, they would've killed us already."
00:03:53.525,00:03:55.485,This is it.
00:03:55.569,00:03:57.654,This is where Forrestal cashed in.
00:03:57.738,00:03:59.740,SATIPO: A friend of yours? A competitor.
00:03:59.823,00:04:02.117,He was good.
00:04:02.201,00:04:03.952,"He was very, very good."
00:04:04.036,00:04:07.873,"Senor, nobody's come out of there alive."
00:04:07.956,00:04:09.708,Please...
00:04:46.620,00:04:47.621,Senor.
00:05:16.984,00:05:17.901,Stop.
00:05:18.944,00:05:20.070,Stay out of the light.
00:05:42.801,00:05:44.136,Forrestal.
00:06:31.016,00:06:32.767,SATIPO: Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here.
00:06:36.230,00:06:37.480,That's what scares me.
00:06:56.375,00:06:57.876,Stay here.
00:06:57.959,00:06:59.460,"If you insist, senor."
00:08:26.214,00:08:27.215,Give me the whip.
00:08:27.299,00:08:28.508,Throw me the idol.
00:08:31.136,00:08:32.512,No time to argue.
00:08:32.595,00:08:33.847,"Throw me the idol, I throw you the whip."
00:08:34.806,00:08:36.391,Give me the whip!
00:08:36.475,00:08:37.809,"Adios, senor."
00:09:21.353,00:09:22.979,"Adios, Satipo."
00:10:03.186,00:10:05.272,Dr. Jones.
00:10:05.355,00:10:09.734,Again we see there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.
00:10:09.817,00:10:11.319,And you thought I had given up.
00:10:23.290,00:10:26.126,"You chose the wrong friends. This time, it will cost you."
00:10:29.837,00:10:34.342,"Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq."
00:10:34.675,00:10:37.095,"Yes, too bad."
00:10:37.178,00:10:40.932,"You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos."
00:11:28.229,00:11:29.397,Jock! Start the engines!
00:11:30.398,00:11:31.316,Get it up!
00:11:35.529,00:11:36.988,"Jock, the engines!"
00:11:38.031,00:11:39.574,"Start the engines, Jock!"
00:12:29.165,00:12:32.126,"There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!"
00:12:32.210,00:12:34.671,"Oh, that's just my pet snake Reggie!"
00:12:35.505,00:12:37.215,"I hate snakes, Jock!"
00:12:37.298,00:12:39.300,I hate 'em!
00:12:39.384,00:12:41.469,"Come on! Show a little backbone, will ya?"
00:12:58.403,00:13:03.575,"Neo, meaning new and Lithic... I-T-H..."
00:13:03.658,00:13:06.578,"...I-C, meaning stone."
00:13:06.661,00:13:10.039,"All right, let's get back to this site: Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton."
00:13:10.123,00:13:14.586,"Contains a central passage and three chambers, or cysts..."
00:13:20.508,00:13:26.805,"...don't confuse that with robbing, in which case we mean the removal of the contents of the barrow."
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.558,This site also demonstrates...
00:13:31.436,00:13:36.775,"...one of the great dangers of archeology, not to life and limb, although that does sometimes take place."
00:13:36.857,00:13:39.277,"No, I'm talking about folklore."
00:13:39.360,00:13:50.079,"In this case, local tradition held that there was a golden coffin buried at the site, and this accounts for the holes dug all over the barrow and the generally poor condition of the find."
00:13:50.163,00:13:56.835,"However, chamber three was undisturbed, and the undisturbed chamber and the grave goods that were found in another, uh..."
00:13:56.919,00:13:58.588,"in the area, give us a r..."
00:14:00.465,00:14:01.840,Uh...
00:14:03.301,00:14:07.597,"...reason to da... to, uh, to-to date this, uh, find as we have."
00:14:09.265,00:14:11.225,"Um... Any questions, then?"
00:14:11.309,00:14:13.060,"No? Okay, that's it for the day, then."
00:14:14.103,00:14:16.022,"Um, don't forget..."
00:14:16.105,00:14:19.859,"Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time."
00:14:19.942,00:14:22.362,"And I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday."
00:14:32.706,00:14:33.832,"I had it, Marcus."
00:14:33.914,00:14:36.042,I had it in my hand.
00:14:36.125,00:14:37.960,What happened? Guess.
00:14:40.254,00:14:41.881,Belloq? You want to hear about it?
00:14:41.964,00:14:43.675,Not at all.
00:14:43.758,00:14:48.847,I'm sure everything you do for the museum conforms to the International Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.
00:14:48.929,00:14:50.640,"It's beautiful, Marcus."
00:14:50.724,00:14:52.308,I can get it. I got it all figured out.
00:14:52.392,00:14:53.852,There's only one place he can sell it: Marrakech.
00:14:53.934,00:14:55.102,"I need $2,000. Look..."
00:14:55.186,00:14:56.270,"Listen to me, old boy."
00:14:56.354,00:14:57.605,I brought some people to see you.
00:14:57.689,00:14:58.732,Look.
00:14:58.815,00:15:00.233,I got these pieces.
00:15:00.316,00:15:01.359,"They're good pieces, Marcus."
00:15:01.442,00:15:02.443,Look.
00:15:02.527,00:15:04.195,Indiana...
00:15:04.278,00:15:06.531,"Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked."
00:15:06.614,00:15:07.741,"Yes, they are nice."
00:15:07.824,00:15:09.909,They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
00:15:09.992,00:15:11.870,"But the people I brought are important, and they're waiting."
00:15:11.952,00:15:13.079,What people?
00:15:13.162,00:15:14.455,Army Intelligence.
00:15:14.539,00:15:16.207,They knew you were coming before I did.
00:15:16.290,00:15:18.209,Seem to know everything.
00:15:18.292,00:15:19.794,They wouldn't tell me what they want.
00:15:19.878,00:15:21.838,"Well, what do I want to see them for?"
00:15:21.921,00:15:24.131,"What am I, in trouble?"
00:15:24.215,00:15:26.593,"EATON: Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you."
00:15:26.676,00:15:28.302,INDY: Have you?
00:15:28.511,00:15:34.016,"Uh, professor of archeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?"
00:15:34.100,00:15:36.977,Obtainer of rare antiquities.
00:15:37.061,00:15:38.229,That's one way of saying it.
00:15:38.312,00:15:39.856,Why don't you sit down? You'll be more comfortable.
00:15:39.898,00:15:41.107,"Oh, thank you. Thank you."
00:15:41.190,00:15:44.485,"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
00:15:44.569,00:15:48.406,"Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago."
00:15:48.489,00:15:51.033,"Yes, I did."
00:15:51.117,00:15:53.286,You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
00:15:54.829,00:15:56.790,"Uh... well, just rumors, really."
00:15:56.873,00:15:58.708,"Somewhere in Asia, I think."
00:15:58.792,00:16:00.376,I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
00:16:00.460,00:16:03.254,"We were friends, but, uh..."
00:16:03.337,00:16:05.339,"had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid."
00:16:05.423,00:16:07.007,Mmm.
00:16:07.091,00:16:11.930,"Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?"
00:16:12.012,00:16:13.013,I understand.
00:16:15.642,00:16:25.109,"Yesterday afternoon, our European sections intercepted a... a German communique that was sent from Cairo to Berlin."
00:16:25.192,00:16:33.159,"Now, to Cairo... See, over the last two years, the Nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts."
00:16:33.242,00:16:34.452,Hitler's a nut on the subject.
00:16:34.535,00:16:35.829,He's crazy.
00:16:35.912,00:16:38.038,He's obsessed with the occult.
00:16:38.122,00:16:44.504,"And, right now, apparently, there's some kind of German archeological dig going on in the desert outside of Cairo."
00:16:44.587,00:16:48.215,"Now, we've got some information here, but we can't make anything out of it, and maybe you can."
00:16:49.634,00:16:52.929,''Tanis development proceeding.
00:16:53.012,00:16:56.683,"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra."
00:16:56.766,00:16:58.852,"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."
00:17:00.353,00:17:02.730,The Nazis have discovered Tanis.
00:17:02.814,00:17:05.692,"EATON: Just what does that mean to you, uh, Tanis?"
00:17:05.775,00:17:07.485,"Well, it..."
00:17:07.568,00:17:09.863,The city of Tanis is one of the possible resting places of the Lost Ark.
00:17:09.946,00:17:11.197,The Lost Ark?
00:17:11.280,00:17:13.032,"Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant."
00:17:13.115,00:17:15.159,The chest the Hebrews used to carry around the Ten Commandments.
00:17:15.242,00:17:16.494,"What do you mean, commandments?"
00:17:16.577,00:17:18.078,You talking about the Ten Commandments?
00:17:18.162,00:17:20.039,"Yes, the actual Ten Commandments."
00:17:20.122,00:17:25.712,"The original stone tablets that Moses brought down out of Mount Horeb and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing."
00:17:27.296,00:17:28.715,Any of you guys ever go to Sunday school?
00:17:28.798,00:17:29.799,"Well, I..."
00:17:29.883,00:17:31.133,"Oh, look."
00:17:31.217,00:17:37.598,"The Hebrews took the broken pieces and put them in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan, they put the Ark in a place called the Temple of Solomon."
00:17:37.682,00:17:39.017,In Jerusalem.
00:17:39.099,00:17:40.518,Where it stayed for many years.
00:17:40.601,00:17:42.478,"Until, all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone."
00:17:42.562,00:17:44.022,Where?
00:17:44.104,00:17:45.982,"Well, nobody knows where or when."
00:17:46.065,00:17:47.650,"However, an Egyptian pharaoh..."
00:17:47.734,00:17:49.986,Shishak. Yes.
00:17:50.069,00:17:58.036,"...invaded the city of Jerusalem right about 980 BC, and he may have taken the Ark back to the city of Tanis and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls."
00:17:58.494,00:18:00.580,Secret chamber?
00:18:00.663,00:18:10.339,"BRODY: However, about a year after the pharaoh would return to Egypt, the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year."
00:18:10.423,00:18:12.383,Wiped clean by the wrath of God.
00:18:14.802,00:18:16.554,Uh-huh.
00:18:16.637,00:18:18.305,"Obviously, we've come to the right men."
00:18:18.389,00:18:21.350,"Now you seem to know, uh, all about this Tanis, then."
00:18:21.434,00:18:22.643,"No, no, not really."
00:18:22.727,00:18:25.312,Ravenwood is the real expert.
00:18:25.396,00:18:27.189,Abner did the first serious work on Tanis.
00:18:27.273,00:18:29.817,Collected some of its relics.
00:18:29.901,00:18:32.779,"It was his obsession, really."
00:18:32.862,00:18:34.280,But he never found the city.
00:18:34.363,00:18:37.575,"Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood."
00:18:37.658,00:18:41.579,An American being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.
00:18:41.662,00:18:44.123,"Oh, rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi."
00:18:44.206,00:18:46.667,"Well, what do the Nazis want him for, then?"
00:18:46.751,00:18:52.506,"Well, obviously, the Nazis are looking for the headpiece to the Staff of Ra and they think Abner's got it."
00:18:52.590,00:18:55.342,What exactly is a headpiece to the Staff of Ra?
00:18:55.426,00:18:56.970,"Well, the staff is just a stick..."
00:18:57.053,00:19:00.139,"I don't know, about this big, nobody really knows for sure how high..."
00:19:00.222,00:19:05.728,"And it's... it's, uh... it's capped with an elaborate headpiece..."
00:19:05.812,00:19:08.815,"in the shape of the sun, with a crystal in the center."
00:19:08.898,00:19:13.402,And what you did was you take the staff to a special room in Tanis...
00:19:13.486,00:19:25.164,"A map room with a miniature of the city all laid out on the floor, and if you put the staff in a certain place, at a certain time of day, the sun shone through here and made a beam that came down on the floor here..."
00:19:25.247,00:19:28.417,and gave you the exact location of the Well of the Souls.
00:19:28.501,00:19:30.628,"Where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, right?"
00:19:30.711,00:19:32.964,Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
00:19:33.047,00:19:35.341,What does this Ark look like?
00:19:35.424,00:19:37.176,Uh...
00:19:37.259,00:19:38.845,INDY: There's a picture of it right here.
00:19:43.516,00:19:45.267,That's it.
00:19:52.108,00:19:53.693,EATON: Good God.
00:19:53.776,00:19:56.112,"Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought."
00:19:56.195,00:19:57.655,Uh...
00:19:57.738,00:19:59.866,"now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?"
00:19:59.949,00:20:01.534,INDY: Lightning...
00:20:01.617,00:20:03.911,fire...
00:20:03.995,00:20:05.872,power of God or something.
00:20:08.166,00:20:10.459,EATON: I'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.
00:20:10.543,00:20:11.961,"BRODY: Oh, yes."
00:20:12.045,00:20:17.758,"The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions."
00:20:17.842,00:20:21.721,An army which carries the Ark before it...
00:20:21.804,00:20:23.097,is invincible.
00:20:43.826,00:20:46.037,"You did it, didn't you?"
00:20:46.120,00:20:47.496,They want you to go for it.
00:20:50.208,00:20:54.921,They want you to get a hold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
00:20:55.004,00:20:56.130,And the museum?
00:20:56.255,00:20:57.631,The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
00:20:57.715,00:20:58.966,"Oh, yes."
00:21:00.760,00:21:03.637,Oh...
00:21:03.721,00:21:05.806,The Ark of the Covenant.
00:21:05.890,00:21:08.517,Nothing else has come close.
00:21:08.601,00:21:13.231,That thing represents everything we got into archeology for in the first place.
00:21:13.313,00:21:16.358,Mmm!
00:21:16.442,00:21:18.819,"You know, five years ago, I would've gone after it myself."
00:21:18.903,00:21:21.239,I'm really rather envious.
00:21:21.321,00:21:23.074,I've got to locate Abner.
00:21:23.157,00:21:24.784,I think I know where to start.
00:21:29.914,00:21:31.874,Suppose she'll still be with him?
00:21:31.958,00:21:34.127,"Possibly, but..."
00:21:34.210,00:21:37.922,"Marion's the least of your worries right now, believe me, Indy."
00:21:38.005,00:21:40.007,What do you mean?
00:21:40.091,00:21:47.098,"Well, I mean that for nearly 3,000 years, man has been searching for the Lost Ark."
00:21:47.181,00:21:50.893,Not something to be taken lightly.
00:21:50.977,00:21:54.939,No one knows its secrets.
00:21:55.022,00:21:58.776,It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.
00:22:00.486,00:22:02.113,"What are you trying to do, scare me?"
00:22:02.196,00:22:03.239,You sound like my mother.
00:22:03.322,00:22:04.991,We've known each other for a long time.
00:22:05.074,00:22:08.368,"I don't believe in magic, a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus."
00:22:08.452,00:22:11.455,I'm going after a find of incredible historical significance.
00:22:11.538,00:22:13.373,You're talking about the bogeyman.
00:22:13.457,00:22:15.709,"Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am."
00:22:26.679,00:22:28.222,"Nice to see you again, Dr. Jones."
00:22:28.306,00:22:29.307,Thank you.
00:23:42.171,00:23:43.421,Shh... shh...
00:24:01.899,00:24:03.025,Shh...
00:24:34.848,00:24:36.516,Give him space! Give him space!
00:24:36.600,00:24:37.893,"Go on, Regan!"
00:24:40.229,00:24:42.273,Shh! Shh!
00:24:42.356,00:24:43.690,Shh! Shh! Shh!
00:25:28.526,00:25:29.862,"INDY: Hello, Marion."
00:25:36.827,00:25:38.412,Indiana Jones.
00:25:42.041,00:25:45.878,"Always knew, someday, you'd come walking back through my door."
00:25:45.961,00:25:47.671,I never doubted that.
00:25:47.754,00:25:50.132,Something made it inevitable.
00:25:50.216,00:25:53.010,"So, what are you doing here in Nepal?"
00:25:53.093,00:25:55.721,I need one of the pieces your father collected.
00:25:55.804,00:26:00.184,I learned to hate you in the last ten years.
00:26:00.267,00:26:01.477,I never meant to hurt you.
00:26:01.559,00:26:02.644,I was a child.
00:26:02.728,00:26:04.104,I was in love.
00:26:04.188,00:26:05.731,It was wrong and you knew it!
00:26:05.814,00:26:07.149,You knew what you were doing.
00:26:07.233,00:26:08.984,Now I do! This is my place.
00:26:09.068,00:26:10.152,Get out!
00:26:13.364,00:26:14.490,I did what I did.
00:26:14.572,00:26:17.617,"You don't have to be happy about it, but maybe we could help each other out now."
00:26:19.828,00:26:21.579,I need one of the pieces your father collected.
00:26:21.663,00:26:25.251,"Bronze piece, about this size, with a hole in it, off-center, with a crystal."
00:26:25.334,00:26:26.210,You know the one I mean?
00:26:26.293,00:26:28.087,Yeah.
00:26:28.170,00:26:29.213,I know it.
00:26:29.296,00:26:31.340,Where's Abner?
00:26:31.424,00:26:33.967,Where's Abner?
00:26:34.051,00:26:35.094,Abner's dead.
00:26:40.349,00:26:43.477,"Marion, I'm sorry."
00:26:43.561,00:26:45.854,"Do you know what you did to me, to my life?"
00:26:45.938,00:26:48.357,I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
00:26:48.441,00:26:50.276,"Well, say it again, anyway."
00:26:50.359,00:26:51.402,Sorry.
00:26:51.485,00:26:53.946,"Yeah, everybody's sorry."
00:26:54.029,00:26:57.575,Abner was sorry for dragging me all over this earth looking for his little bits of junk.
00:26:57.657,00:27:00.618,I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.
00:27:00.702,00:27:03.414,Everybody's sorry for something.
00:27:03.497,00:27:05.082,"INDY: It's a worthless bronze medallion, Marion."
00:27:05.165,00:27:06.166,You going to give it to me?
00:27:06.250,00:27:07.585,Maybe.
00:27:07.667,00:27:09.336,I don't know where it is.
00:27:09.420,00:27:12.714,"Well, maybe you could find it."
00:27:12.798,00:27:16.218,"3,000 bucks."
00:27:16.302,00:27:20.013,"Well, that will get me back, but not in style."
00:27:20.097,00:27:22.349,I can get you another two when we get to the States.
00:27:22.433,00:27:24.143,"It's important, Marion."
00:27:25.603,00:27:26.644,Trust me.
00:27:28.564,00:27:29.856,You know the piece I mean?
00:27:29.940,00:27:31.525,Do you know where it is?
00:27:35.112,00:27:36.029,Come back tomorrow.
00:27:37.697,00:27:39.074,Why?
00:27:39.158,00:27:41.619,"Because I said so, that's why."
00:27:48.959,00:27:50.002,Ha!
00:27:50.085,00:27:52.004,"See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones."
00:29:00.447,00:29:02.366,"Good evening, Fraulein."
00:29:02.449,00:29:04.243,MARION: The bar's closed.
00:29:07.454,00:29:09.748,not thirsty.
00:29:09.831,00:29:11.166,What do you want?
00:29:11.250,00:29:14.211,The same thing your friend Dr. Jones wanted.
00:29:14.294,00:29:18.465,Surely he told you there would be other interested parties.
00:29:18.549,00:29:21.009,Must've slipped his mind.
00:29:21.093,00:29:25.389,The man is... nefarious.
00:29:25.472,00:29:29.101,"I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it."
00:29:29.184,00:29:31.437,"Why, are you willing to offer more?"
00:29:31.520,00:29:34.398,"Oh, almost certainly."
00:29:34.481,00:29:35.774,Do you still have it?
00:29:41.697,00:29:42.781,No.
00:29:44.032,00:29:45.701,But I know where it is.
00:29:47.286,00:29:49.788,"Hey, how about a drink for you and your men?"
00:29:49.871,00:29:55.085,Your fire is dying here.
00:29:55.168,00:29:58.046,Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?
00:29:58.130,00:30:01.425,"Listen, Herr Mac..."
00:30:01.508,00:30:07.180,"I don't know what kind of people you're used to dealing with, but nobody tells me what to do in my place."
00:30:07.264,00:30:14.688,"Fraulein Ravenwood, let me show you what I am used to."
00:30:17.149,00:30:20.193,MARION: Take your hands off me!
00:30:21.779,00:30:23.739,Take your lousy hands off!
00:30:30.870,00:30:31.955,Wait a minute.
00:30:32.038,00:30:33.457,"Wait, I... I can be reasonable."
00:30:33.540,00:30:35.542,That time is passed.
00:30:35.626,00:30:37.377,You don't need that.
00:30:38.920,00:30:39.838,Wait...
00:30:41.715,00:30:43.967,I'll tell you everything.
00:30:53.477,00:30:54.394,Let her go.
00:32:09.511,00:32:10.512,Whiskey.
00:32:19.646,00:32:20.773,Shoot them.
00:32:21.607,00:32:22.649,Shoot them both.
00:33:17.830,00:33:19.038,My medallion!
00:33:26.964,00:33:31.176,"MARION: Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time!"
00:33:31.259,00:33:32.719,"Boy, you're something!"
00:33:32.803,00:33:34.012,"Yeah, I'll tell you what."
00:33:34.095,00:33:38.099,"Until I get back my $5,000, you're going to get more than you bargained for."
00:33:38.183,00:33:40.519,I'm your goddamn partner!
00:34:18.765,00:34:20.851,"Cairo, city of the living."
00:34:20.934,00:34:22.978,A paradise on earth.
00:34:24.396,00:34:25.856,Silence!
00:34:25.939,00:34:27.357,Why do you forget yourselves?
00:34:29.067,00:34:30.527,Where did this animal come from?
00:34:34.113,00:34:35.073,"Oh... oh, no."
00:34:38.493,00:34:39.786,Cute.
00:34:39.870,00:34:41.371,What an adorable creature.
00:34:43.540,00:34:45.918,Then it shall be welcome in our house.
00:34:46.001,00:34:48.086,"Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me."
00:34:56.595,00:34:59.097,"INDY: I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah."
00:34:59.180,00:35:01.349,You're the best digger in Egypt.
00:35:01.433,00:35:05.062,My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
00:35:05.144,00:35:07.606,They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
00:35:07.689,00:35:10.609,The excavation is enormous.
00:35:10.692,00:35:14.487,They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
00:35:14.571,00:35:16.990,It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
00:35:17.074,00:35:18.909,When did they find the map room?
00:35:18.992,00:35:20.201,Three days ago.
00:35:20.285,00:35:22.621,They have not one brain among them.
00:35:22.704,00:35:24.664,Except one.
00:35:24.748,00:35:26.625,He is very clever. He's a French archeologist.
00:35:29.419,00:35:30.503,What's his name?
00:35:30.587,00:35:31.630,They call him Bellosh.
00:35:38.637,00:35:41.556,Belloq. Belloq.
00:35:41.640,00:35:44.643,The Germans have a great advantage over us.
00:35:44.726,00:35:47.562,They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
00:35:47.646,00:35:52.525,"Well, they're not going to find it without this."
00:35:52.609,00:35:54.694,Who can tell us about these markings?
00:35:57.238,00:35:59.282,Perhaps a man I know can help us.
00:36:01.743,00:36:03.036,Indy...
00:36:04.955,00:36:07.124,there is something that troubles me.
00:36:07.206,00:36:10.251,What is it?
00:36:10.335,00:36:12.337,The Ark.
00:36:12.420,00:36:18.343,"If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb."
00:36:18.426,00:36:21.346,Death has always surrounded it.
00:36:21.429,00:36:23.765,It is not of this earth.
00:36:23.849,00:36:25.391,"Do we need the monkey, huh?"
00:36:25.475,00:36:29.604,"I'm surprised at you, Jones, talking that way about our baby."
00:36:29.688,00:36:31.189,"He's got your looks, too."
00:36:31.272,00:36:32.315,And your brains.
00:36:32.398,00:36:34.192,Oops!
00:36:34.275,00:36:35.401,I noticed that.
00:36:35.485,00:36:37.654,She's a smart little thing. Smart.
00:36:41.950,00:36:43.493,"Hey, where you going?"
00:36:43.576,00:36:45.037,She'll be all right. Have a date.
00:36:48.957,00:36:50.125,Come on. Come on.
00:36:50.208,00:36:52.127,Okay... Marion.
00:36:52.210,00:36:53.211,What's this?
00:36:53.294,00:36:54.754,It's a date.
00:36:54.838,00:36:55.839,You eat 'em.
00:37:45.388,00:37:49.350,"MARION: How come you haven't found some nice girl to settle down with, raise eight or nine kids, like your friend Sallah?"
00:37:49.434,00:37:50.727,INDY: Who says I haven't?
00:37:52.353,00:37:53.563,I do.
00:37:53.646,00:37:55.148,Dad had you figured a long time ago.
00:38:05.033,00:38:06.243,He said you were a bum.
00:38:06.325,00:38:07.786,"Oh, he's being generous."
00:38:07.869,00:38:10.205,The most gifted bum he ever trained.
00:38:10.288,00:38:12.165,"You know, he loved you like a son."
00:38:12.249,00:38:13.708,Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
00:38:13.792,00:38:14.793,"Not much, just you."
00:38:33.019,00:38:34.353,"Marion, get out of here!"
00:38:34.813,00:38:35.814,Duck!
00:39:17.939,00:39:19.232,Right.
00:40:01.358,00:40:03.401,Shh! Shh!
00:40:09.741,00:40:11.117,Marion!
00:40:31.304,00:40:33.765,"MARION: Help! Over here, Indy!"
00:40:33.848,00:40:34.933,INDY: Get out of the way!
00:40:35.016,00:40:36.309,Move! Move it!
00:40:37.643,00:40:38.477,MARION: Help me!
00:40:44.401,00:40:45.777,You can't do this to me!
00:40:45.860,00:40:47.486,I'm an American!
00:40:52.784,00:40:54.786,Indiana Jones!
00:40:54.869,00:40:56.037,"Help me, Jones!"
00:41:18.684,00:41:19.727,Marion!
00:42:07.233,00:42:08.526,INDY: Marion...
00:42:46.147,00:42:47.273,MAN: Dr. Jones.
00:43:14.551,00:43:15.801,You looking for me?
00:43:24.894,00:43:26.396,Belloq.
00:43:26.479,00:43:28.064,"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
00:43:28.147,00:43:29.982,I ought to kill you right now.
00:43:30.066,00:43:33.778,Not a very private place for a murder.
00:43:33.861,00:43:36.573,"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other."
00:43:36.655,00:43:39.951,They're not going to interfere in our business.
00:43:40.034,00:43:42.537,It was not I who brought the girl into this business.
00:43:42.620,00:43:44.747,"Please, sit down before you fall down."
00:43:44.830,00:43:47.125,We can at least behave like civilized people.
00:43:58.761,00:44:01.806,I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
00:44:01.889,00:44:06.644,"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
00:44:06.727,00:44:08.646,I almost regret it.
00:44:08.729,00:44:12.024,Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
00:44:12.108,00:44:13.859,Try the local sewer.
00:44:16.862,00:44:19.865,You and I are very much alike.
00:44:19.949,00:44:26.747,"Archeology is our religion, yet we have both fallen from the purer faith."
00:44:26.831,00:44:30.335,Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
00:44:30.418,00:44:33.671,I am a shadowy reflection of you.
00:44:33.754,00:44:39.135,"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
00:44:39.218,00:44:42.514,Now you're getting nasty.
00:44:42.597,00:44:44.557,You know it's true.
00:44:44.641,00:44:46.601,How nice.
00:44:46.684,00:44:48.727,Look at this.
00:44:48.811,00:44:50.855,It's worthless.
00:44:50.938,00:44:52.982,Ten dollars from a vendor in the street.
00:44:53.065,00:44:59.531,"But I take it, I bury it in the sand for a thousand years, it becomes priceless... Like the Ark."
00:44:59.614,00:45:01.491,Men will kill for it.
00:45:01.574,00:45:04.577,Men like you and me.
00:45:04.661,00:45:07.955,"What about your boss, der Fuhrer?"
00:45:08.039,00:45:11.292,I thought he was waiting to take possession.
00:45:11.376,00:45:14.086,All in good time.
00:45:14.170,00:45:16.255,When I am finished with it.
00:45:16.339,00:45:19.884,"Jones, do you realize what the Ark is?"
00:45:19.967,00:45:22.094,It's a transmitter.
00:45:22.178,00:45:24.721,It's a radio for speaking to God.
00:45:24.805,00:45:26.349,And it's within my reach.
00:45:28.518,00:45:31.979,You want to talk to God?
00:45:32.063,00:45:34.106,Let's go see Him together.
00:45:34.190,00:45:35.732,I've got nothing better to do.
00:45:37.193,00:45:39.487,"CHILD: Uncle Indy, come back home now!"
00:45:41.280,00:45:42.281,Uncle Indy!
00:45:43.866,00:45:47.453,"Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you."
00:45:49.539,00:45:50.747,Uncle Indy!
00:46:05.096,00:46:06.639,I thought I would find you there.
00:46:06.723,00:46:08.765,"Better than the United States Marines, eh?"
00:46:19.110,00:46:20.319,Marion's dead.
00:46:20.403,00:46:21.404,"Yes, I know."
00:46:21.487,00:46:22.739,And me! And me!
00:46:22.821,00:46:24.323,I'm sorry.
00:46:25.157,00:46:27.159,"Life goes on, Indy."
00:46:27.243,00:46:28.536,There is the proof.
00:46:30.329,00:46:31.205,Uh-oh.
00:46:32.331,00:46:34.166,I have much to tell you.
00:46:34.250,00:46:37.962,"First we will take them home, and then I will take you to the old man."
00:47:29.138,00:47:31.349,INDY: I can't figure out how Belloq did it.
00:47:31.432,00:47:33.976,Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?
00:47:34.059,00:47:37.146,"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
00:47:37.229,00:47:44.069,"I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes: A headpiece like that one, except round the edges, which were rougher."
00:47:44.153,00:47:52.537,"In the center, the Frenchman had embedded a crystal, and... and surrounding the crystal, on one side, there were raised markings, just like that one."
00:47:55.456,00:47:57.542,They made their calculations in the map room?
00:47:57.625,00:47:58.835,SALLAH: This morning.
00:47:58.917,00:48:01.128,"Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich."
00:48:02.839,00:48:09.554,"When they came out of the map room, they gave us a new spot in which to dig, out away from the camp."
00:48:09.637,00:48:11.263,"The Well of the Souls, huh?"
00:48:11.347,00:48:15.184,"Come, come, look. Look here... Look."
00:48:15.267,00:48:16.686,Sit down.
00:48:16.769,00:48:18.187,"Come, sit down."
00:48:18.270,00:48:20.606,What is it?
00:48:20.690,00:48:25.152,This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
00:48:25.236,00:48:27.029,"What about the height of the staff, though?"
00:48:27.112,00:48:28.364,Did Belloq get it off of here?
00:48:28.447,00:48:30.533,Yes. It is here.
00:48:30.616,00:48:34.829,"This were the old way, this mean six kadam high."
00:48:34.911,00:48:35.912,About 72 inches. Wait!
00:48:39.834,00:48:46.591,And take back one kadam to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.
00:48:58.853,00:49:00.563,You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
00:49:00.646,00:49:02.523,Are you absolutely sure?
00:49:04.358,00:49:06.861,Belloq's staff is too long.
00:49:06.943,00:49:08.696,BOTH: They're digging in the wrong place.
00:49:26.756,00:49:28.382,Bad dates.
00:49:44.022,00:49:48.235,I told you not to be premature in your communique to Berlin.
00:49:48.319,00:49:52.114,Archeology is not an exact science.
00:49:52.197,00:49:54.450,It does not deal in time schedules.
00:49:54.533,00:49:56.327,The Fuhrer is not a patient man.
00:49:56.410,00:49:59.413,"He demands constant reports, and he expects progress."
00:49:59.497,00:50:00.665,You led me to believe...
00:50:00.748,00:50:02.500,Nothing! I made no promises.
00:50:02.583,00:50:04.877,I only said it looked very favorable.
00:50:04.961,00:50:09.966,"Besides, with the information in our possession, my calculations were correct."
00:50:10.048,00:50:11.634,"INDY: Boy, they're not kidding, are they?"
00:50:13.385,00:50:15.638,What time does the sun hit the map room?
00:50:15.721,00:50:17.723,SALLAH: At about 9:00 in the morning.
00:50:17.807,00:50:19.558,"INDY: Not much time, then."
00:50:19.642,00:50:21.853,Where are they digging for the Well of the Souls?
00:50:21.936,00:50:24.772,SALLAH: On that ridge... but the map room's over there.
00:50:24.856,00:50:26.022,"INDY: Let's go, come on."
00:54:32.686,00:54:34.188,Sallah.
00:54:35.606,00:54:37.273,Sallah!
00:54:45.116,00:54:46.158,They're here.
00:54:57.293,00:54:58.462,"Please, my friend, what is the matter?"
00:54:58.545,00:55:00.172,I fetch the water. I shall get it for you.
00:55:03.299,00:55:04.635,"If you want water, I will get you water."
00:55:04.718,00:55:05.844,"No problem, no problem."
00:55:20.859,00:55:22.318,I thought you were dead.
00:55:22.402,00:55:23.779,You must have switched baskets.
00:55:28.366,00:55:29.493,Are you hurt?
00:55:29.576,00:55:31.954,"No. You have to get me out of here, quick."
00:55:32.037,00:55:33.789,They're gonna be back at any minute.
00:55:33.872,00:55:35.499,Cut me loose.
00:55:35.582,00:55:36.625,Quick.
00:55:36.708,00:55:39.128,They keep asking about you. What you know.
00:55:43.966,00:55:45.134,What's wrong?
00:55:45.217,00:55:46.342,Cut me loose.
00:55:46.426,00:55:47.928,"I know where the Ark is, Marion."
00:55:48.012,00:55:50.139,The Ark's here?
00:55:50.222,00:55:51.807,"I'm coming with you, Jones. Get me out of here!"
00:55:51.890,00:55:53.309,Cut me loose! You can't leave me here!
00:55:53.391,00:55:55.978,"If I take you out of here now, they'll start combing the place for us."
00:55:56.061,00:55:57.353,"Jones, you've got to get me out of here!"
00:55:57.437,00:56:00.524,"Come on, Jones, are you crazy?"
00:56:00.607,00:56:06.738,"Marion, I hate to do this, but if you don't sit still and keep quiet, this whole thing is going to be shot."
00:56:08.324,00:56:10.117,I'll be back to get you.
00:56:10.201,00:56:11.285,"Jones, what's the matter?"
00:56:57.122,00:56:58.623,That's it.
00:56:59.666,00:57:00.709,Who knows?
00:57:00.792,00:57:05.505,Perhaps the Ark is still waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.
00:57:05.589,00:57:08.592,Perhaps there's some vital bit of evidence which eludes us.
00:57:08.675,00:57:09.801,Perhaps...
00:57:09.885,00:57:11.095,Perhaps the girl can help us.
00:57:11.178,00:57:13.222,My feeling exactly.
00:57:13.305,00:57:15.307,She was in possession of the original piece for years.
00:57:15.391,00:57:18.602,"She may know much, if properly motivated."
00:57:18.685,00:57:20.229,"I tell you, the girl knows nothing."
00:57:21.772,00:57:23.440,I'm surprised to find you squeamish.
00:57:23.523,00:57:25.276,That is not your reputation.
00:57:25.359,00:57:26.735,But it needn't concern you.
00:57:26.818,00:57:28.820,I have the perfect man for this kind of work.
00:57:34.659,00:57:35.911,Heil Hitler.
00:58:58.869,00:59:00.204,SALLAH: Indy! Here!
00:59:00.287,00:59:01.497,We've hit stone!
00:59:06.043,00:59:07.252,INDY: Clear it off.
00:59:07.336,00:59:08.337,"Come on, find the edges."
00:59:25.479,00:59:27.064,"SALLAH: Good, good, good."
00:59:27.147,00:59:28.524,"You see, Indy? You see?"
00:59:28.606,00:59:30.401,"Okay, bring the pry bars in."
00:59:30.484,00:59:31.943,"As a team, boys! As a team!"
00:59:34.071,00:59:35.197,Push!
00:59:40.411,00:59:42.204,INDY: Get 'em in there. Get 'em under.
00:59:42.287,00:59:43.330,"Good, good, that's it."
00:59:43.414,00:59:44.456,Watch your toes.
00:59:52.756,00:59:53.757,"SALLAH: Carefully, carefully!"
01:00:06.270,01:00:07.812,"Sorry, Indy."
01:00:09.565,01:00:11.358,Indy...
01:00:11.442,01:00:13.068,why does the floor move?
01:00:15.279,01:00:16.821,Give me your torch.
01:00:47.478,01:00:49.646,Snakes.
01:00:49.729,01:00:51.440,Why did it have to be snakes?
01:00:54.901,01:00:57.321,Asps.
01:00:57.404,01:01:00.157,Very dangerous.
01:01:00.240,01:01:01.366,You go first.
01:01:21.637,01:01:28.101,"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
01:01:35.400,01:01:37.486,I must apologize for their treatment of you.
01:01:37.569,01:01:38.570,Yeah. Whose idea was it?
01:01:38.654,01:01:39.863,"No food, no water."
01:01:39.946,01:01:42.491,What kind of people are these friends of yours?
01:01:42.574,01:01:46.828,"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
01:01:46.911,01:01:48.705,They're not my friends.
01:01:48.788,01:01:55.795,"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
01:01:57.755,01:01:59.633,It's beautiful.
01:01:59.716,01:02:01.718,I would very much like to see you in it.
01:02:04.221,01:02:05.722,I'll bet you would.
01:02:10.477,01:02:12.020,All right.
01:02:20.237,01:02:21.655,What do you got to drink around here?
01:02:24.741,01:02:26.993,We don't have much time.
01:02:27.077,01:02:35.919,"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
01:02:36.002,01:02:39.506,"Some, uh, piece of information..."
01:02:39.590,01:02:42.008,which I can use to protect you from them.
01:02:42.092,01:02:44.386,MARION: I've already told you everything I know.
01:02:44.469,01:02:47.055,I have no loyalty to Jones.
01:02:47.138,01:02:48.765,He's brought me nothing but trouble.
01:02:55.855,01:02:57.274,"Marion, you are beautiful."
01:03:03.071,01:03:04.448,I don't think we need a chaperone.
01:03:09.244,01:03:10.621,SALLAH: Steadily.
01:03:10.704,01:03:11.955,Steadily. Whoa!
01:03:14.708,01:03:16.084,Down...
01:03:16.167,01:03:17.294,Down... Whoa.
01:03:17.377,01:03:18.253,"Carefully, carefully!"
01:03:19.337,01:03:20.547,"You all right, Indy?"
01:03:23.800,01:03:26.678,"SALLAH: Now gently, boys. Gently, gently!"
01:03:35.353,01:03:36.354,Whoa...
01:03:47.240,01:03:48.408,I told you it will be all right.
01:04:04.882,01:04:06.343,Huh...
01:04:14.934,01:04:16.478,"Sallah, get down here!"
01:04:36.331,01:04:37.749,You pour.
01:06:31.613,01:06:32.906,"Oh, that's good."
01:06:36.326,01:06:37.535,Whoops.
01:06:43.959,01:06:45.585,"What is this stuff, Rene?"
01:06:47.044,01:06:48.421,I grew up with this.
01:06:50.465,01:06:51.842,It's my family label.
01:07:21.538,01:07:24.791,"Well... I have to be going now, Rene."
01:07:27.502,01:07:30.087,"I like you, Rene, very much."
01:07:30.171,01:07:32.549,Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.
01:07:37.512,01:07:38.889,"We meet again, Fraulein."
01:07:40.807,01:07:42.517,"You Americans, you're all the same."
01:07:45.311,01:07:47.480,Always overdressing for the wrong occasions.
01:08:19.220,01:08:20.931,Now...
01:08:23.892,01:08:25.810,what shall we talk about?
01:09:44.347,01:09:46.724,INDY: All right... take it up!
01:09:46.808,01:09:48.184,Easy!
01:09:50.269,01:09:52.229,You're as stubborn as that girl.
01:09:52.313,01:09:55.150,"TOHT: You like her too much, I think."
01:09:55.232,01:09:58.653,BELLOQ: Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
01:09:58.736,01:10:03.074,You would use a bulldozer to find a... china cup.
01:10:08.454,01:10:10.289,Colonel! Wake your men!
01:10:10.373,01:10:12.333,"Indy, the torches are burning out."
01:10:12.416,01:10:14.418,"Go on, get out of here."
01:10:14.502,01:10:16.087,Hyah!
01:10:34.647,01:10:36.149,Sallah! Hello!
01:10:37.316,01:10:39.235,Hello!
01:10:39.318,01:10:43.698,"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
01:10:43.781,01:10:45.616,Why don't you come on down here! I'll show you!
01:10:45.700,01:10:49.662,"Thank you, my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
01:10:49.746,01:10:50.663,"That's right, isn't it?"
01:10:52.749,01:10:55.334,"Yes, we are very comfortable up here."
01:10:55.418,01:11:01.091,"So, once again, Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
01:11:01.174,01:11:04.177,What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
01:11:04.260,01:11:07.388,You're about to become a permanent addition to this archeological find.
01:11:07.471,01:11:09.224,Who knows?
01:11:09.306,01:11:11.184,"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
01:11:13.561,01:11:15.354,Son of a bitch.
01:11:15.438,01:11:17.023,"DIETRICH: I'm afraid we must be going now, Dr. Jones."
01:11:17.107,01:11:19.358,Our prize is awaited in Berlin.
01:11:19.442,01:11:23.320,But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone.
01:11:23.404,01:11:24.948,"MARION: Slimy pig, you let me go!"
01:11:25.865,01:11:27.700,Stop it!
01:11:29.660,01:11:31.079,Marion!
01:11:31.788,01:11:32.747,INDY: Hang on.
01:11:33.623,01:11:35.041,Don't...
01:11:35.125,01:11:36.209,Indy! Don't fall!
01:11:36.292,01:11:38.044,"Marion, I got you! I got you! I got you!"
01:11:42.715,01:11:44.341,You traitor! You get your hands off of me!
01:11:52.767,01:11:53.643,Snakes!
01:11:55.352,01:11:57.147,"Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!"
01:11:58.481,01:11:59.690,The girl was mine!
01:11:59.774,01:12:01.234,She's of no use to us.
01:12:01.276,01:12:02.568,Only our mission for the Fuhrer matters.
01:12:05.696,01:12:09.617,"I wonder sometimes, monsieur, if you have that clearly in mind."
01:12:09.700,01:12:12.328,"It was not to be, cherie."
01:12:12.411,01:12:14.497,You bastards! I'll get you for this!
01:12:14.580,01:12:17.041,Indiana Jones...
01:12:17.125,01:12:18.126,adieu.
01:12:42.150,01:12:43.484,Take this.
01:12:43.567,01:12:45.236,Wave it at anything that slithers.
01:12:45.320,01:12:46.529,MARION: Thank you.
01:12:46.612,01:12:48.781,"Oh, my God, this whole place is slithering."
01:12:51.826,01:12:52.952,Indy!
01:12:53.036,01:12:54.453,Ow! Jesus!
01:12:58.541,01:12:59.917,Where did you get this? From him?
01:13:00.001,01:13:01.544,I was trying to escape.
01:13:01.627,01:13:02.879,No thanks to you.
01:13:02.962,01:13:04.380,How hard were you trying?
01:13:04.463,01:13:05.422,"Well, where the hell were you?"
01:13:05.506,01:13:06.632,"INDY: Watch it, watch it."
01:13:06.716,01:13:08.092,MARION: What are you doing?
01:13:08.176,01:13:09.468,For the fire!
01:13:11.929,01:13:13.430,How the hell are we going to get out of here?
01:13:13.514,01:13:14.807,I'm working on it! I'm working on it!
01:13:14.891,01:13:16.433,"Well, whatever you're doing, do it faster."
01:13:20.855,01:13:22.648,Ah...
01:13:22.732,01:13:23.941,Where are you going?
01:13:24.025,01:13:26.319,Through that wall.
01:13:26.402,01:13:28.696,"Just get ready to run, whatever happens to me."
01:13:28.779,01:13:30.031,MARION: What do you mean by that?
01:13:42.085,01:13:44.337,Indy!
01:13:44.420,01:13:46.505,Damn it! Don't you leave me down here by myself!
01:14:11.364,01:14:13.074,MARION: Indy!
01:14:13.157,01:14:14.367,Here we go!
01:14:14.450,01:14:15.659,Get ready!
01:14:15.743,01:14:19.372,"Indy, the torch is going out!"
01:15:00.455,01:15:01.705,Indy?
01:15:22.059,01:15:23.978,Marion!
01:15:24.061,01:15:26.105,Look. Look.
01:16:05.186,01:16:07.438,They're going to fly it out of here.
01:16:07.522,01:16:09.982,"When that Ark gets loaded, we're already going to be on the plane."
01:16:15.029,01:16:18.741,"Ah, monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert."
01:16:18.824,01:16:20.076,To the Ark.
01:16:20.159,01:16:22.119,When we are very far from here.
01:16:22.203,01:16:23.620,That will do.
01:17:16.132,01:17:20.386,"Hey, you now... Come here!"
01:17:20.470,01:17:21.804,Come here!
01:18:27.119,01:18:28.496,Indy!
01:19:19.796,01:19:21.674,Stay with the Ark! Stay with the Ark!
01:19:27.263,01:19:28.681,Look out!
01:19:39.108,01:19:40.276,"Oh, my God."
01:19:40.359,01:19:41.569,Marion.
01:19:41.652,01:19:44.280,MARION: In here! Up here!
01:19:46.782,01:19:47.866,"Indy, come on!"
01:19:47.950,01:19:49.076,INDY: Pull on the latch!
01:19:49.159,01:19:50.911,MARION: Move up! It's gonna blow up!
01:19:53.497,01:19:56.375,It's stuck! Indy!
01:19:57.585,01:19:58.794,I can't force the lock!
01:20:28.491,01:20:29.742,It's stuck!
01:20:29.825,01:20:31.118,Turn it! Turn it! It's stuck!
01:20:31.201,01:20:32.620,Turn it there!
01:20:32.703,01:20:33.996,Never mind! Get back! Get back!
01:20:55.726,01:20:57.812,DIETRICH: Get the Ark away from this place immediately.
01:20:57.894,01:20:59.480,Have it put on the truck.
01:20:59.563,01:21:01.482,We'll fly it out of Cairo.
01:21:01.565,01:21:04.109,"And Gobler, I want plenty of protection."
01:21:10.991,01:21:12.618,Jones.
01:21:17.956,01:21:21.585,"Holy smoke, my friends, I... I'm so pleased you're not dead!"
01:21:23.587,01:21:24.963,"Indy, Indy, we have no time."
01:21:25.047,01:21:28.843,"If you still want the Ark, it is being loaded onto a truck for Cairo."
01:21:28.925,01:21:30.761,Truck?
01:21:30.845,01:21:31.887,What truck?
01:21:59.665,01:22:00.791,Let's go!
01:22:09.675,01:22:11.009,Get back to Cairo.
01:22:11.093,01:22:13.220,Get us some transport to England...
01:22:13.303,01:22:16.265,"boat, plane, anything."
01:22:16.348,01:22:18.642,Meet me at Omar's. Be ready for me.
01:22:18.726,01:22:19.852,I'm going after that truck.
01:22:19.935,01:22:21.395,How? I don't know.
01:22:21.478,01:22:22.521,I'm making this up as I go.
01:26:00.155,01:26:01.197,Ew!
01:28:23.882,01:28:24.883,He's there!
01:29:16.852,01:29:18.561,Idiot! Idiot!
01:30:04.482,01:30:06.276,Everything at last has been arranged.
01:30:06.360,01:30:08.070,The Ark? Is on board.
01:30:08.153,01:30:09.779,"Nothing is lacking, now that you're here."
01:30:09.863,01:30:10.947,Or what is left of you.
01:30:11.031,01:30:12.324,You trust these guys?
01:30:12.406,01:30:13.367,Yes.
01:30:15.285,01:30:16.953,Mr. Katanga.
01:30:20.582,01:30:22.542,"Mr. Katanga, these are my friends."
01:30:23.377,01:30:25.461,They are my family.
01:30:25.545,01:30:28.382,I will hear of it if they are not treated well.
01:30:28.464,01:30:30.800,My cabin is theirs.
01:30:30.884,01:30:33.136,Mr. Jones...
01:30:33.220,01:30:35.889,"I've heard a lot about you, sir."
01:30:35.972,01:30:37.933,Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.
01:30:43.230,01:30:44.898,Good-bye.
01:30:47.567,01:30:49.361,SALLAH: Look after each other.
01:30:49.443,01:30:51.196,I am already missing you.
01:30:53.865,01:30:55.242,You're my good friend.
01:30:57.827,01:30:59.371,Sallah.
01:31:03.292,01:31:04.500,That is for Fayah...
01:31:06.378,01:31:08.004,that is for your children...
01:31:08.088,01:31:10.382,and this is for you.
01:31:14.928,01:31:16.346,Thank you.
01:31:50.255,01:31:51.381,INDY: Where did you go?
01:31:52.090,01:31:53.216,I'm cleaning up.
01:31:54.676,01:31:56.803,Where'd you get that?
01:31:56.886,01:31:58.013,From him.
01:31:58.096,01:31:59.431,Who him?
01:31:59.513,01:32:00.598,Katanga.
01:32:00.682,01:32:04.102,I got a feeling I'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates.
01:32:04.186,01:32:06.480,It's lovely.
01:32:06.562,01:32:07.730,Yeah?
01:32:07.814,01:32:08.815,Yeah.
01:32:08.898,01:32:09.732,Really?
01:32:09.816,01:32:11.151,Yeah.
01:32:22.620,01:32:23.705,What'd you say?
01:32:33.340,01:32:35.384,You know you do.
01:32:37.635,01:32:40.013,You're not the man I knew ten years ago.
01:32:40.096,01:32:43.350,"It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage."
01:32:48.646,01:32:50.564,You are...
01:32:51.649,01:32:53.360,"Please, I don't need a nurse."
01:32:53.443,01:32:54.777,I just want to sleep. Don't be such a baby.
01:32:54.861,01:32:56.071,"Marion, leave me alone."
01:32:56.154,01:32:57.155,What is this here? Go away.
01:32:57.239,01:32:59.824,"Yes, it hurts."
01:32:59.908,01:33:01.117,Ow!
01:33:01.201,01:33:04.413,"Well, goddamn it, Indy, where doesn't it hurt?"
01:33:04.496,01:33:06.206,Here.
01:33:12.045,01:33:13.547,Here.
01:33:22.305,01:33:23.806,This isn't too bad.
01:33:55.713,01:33:56.714,Jones...
01:33:59.509,01:34:00.802,Jones?
01:34:03.846,01:34:05.639,"We never seem to get a break, do we?"
01:34:34.252,01:34:36.004,What is it?
01:34:36.087,01:34:38.214,Engines have stopped. I'm going to go check.
01:34:49.601,01:34:51.144,What's happening? We have most important friends.
01:34:51.227,01:34:53.062,Holy shit.
01:34:55.023,01:34:57.025,I sent my man for you. You and the girl must disappear.
01:34:57.108,01:34:58.652,"We have a place in the hold. Come on, go, go, go."
01:34:58.734,01:34:59.653,"Come on, go, my friend, go."
01:35:13.500,01:35:14.584,MAN: Where is Dr. Jones?
01:35:14.668,01:35:15.960,MARION: What's the big idea?
01:35:16.044,01:35:17.462,Let go!
01:35:21.591,01:35:23.426,Don't you touch me.
01:36:10.056,01:36:11.474,"There's no trace yet, sir."
01:36:11.558,01:36:12.766,KATANGA: Jones is dead.
01:36:16.229,01:36:17.272,I killed him.
01:36:18.481,01:36:20.734,He was of no use to us.
01:36:20.816,01:36:24.153,"This girl, however, has certain value where we're headed."
01:36:24.237,01:36:25.655,She'll bring a very good price.
01:36:27.198,01:36:29.117,Mmm?
01:36:29.200,01:36:33.329,"Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken..."
01:36:33.413,01:36:36.040,"If it's your goal, go in peace with it, but leave us the girl."
01:36:36.124,01:36:37.333,It would reduce our loss on this trip.
01:36:37.417,01:36:40.002,Savage!
01:36:40.086,01:36:42.838,You are not in the position to ask for anything.
01:36:42.922,01:36:45.216,We will take what we wish.
01:36:45.300,01:36:48.637,And then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water.
01:36:51.222,01:36:52.474,The girl goes with me.
01:36:54.058,01:36:55.393,She'll be part of my compensation.
01:36:55.477,01:36:58.521,I'm sure your Fuhrer would approve.
01:36:58.605,01:37:02.191,"If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish."
01:37:02.275,01:37:05.320,I will waste no more time with her now.
01:37:05.403,01:37:06.321,Excuse me.
01:37:22.671,01:37:24.088,"I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain."
01:37:24.172,01:37:25.923,I've looked everywhere.
01:37:26.007,01:37:28.301,He's got to be here somewhere.
01:37:28.384,01:37:29.302,Look again.
01:37:31.554,01:37:33.222,I found him. Where?
01:37:33.306,01:37:34.265,There.
01:40:00.994,01:40:04.039,"The altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions, sir."
01:40:04.123,01:40:05.207,Good.
01:40:05.291,01:40:06.918,Take the Ark there immediately.
01:40:09.587,01:40:11.004,Monsieur...
01:40:13.090,01:40:19.054,I am uncomfortable with the thought of this... Jewish ritual.
01:40:19.138,01:40:21.557,Are you sure it's necessary?
01:40:21.641,01:40:29.816,"Let me ask you this: Would you be more comfortable opening the Ark in Berlin, for your Fuhrer?"
01:40:29.899,01:40:33.903,"Finding out, only then, if the sacred pieces of the Covenant are inside?"
01:40:33.987,01:40:40.075,"Knowing, only then, whether you have accomplished your mission, and obtained the one true Ark?"
01:42:08.790,01:42:09.874,Hello!
01:42:12.627,01:42:13.878,Jones.
01:42:15.254,01:42:16.839,Jones!
01:42:16.923,01:42:18.424,"I'm going to blow up the Ark, Rene."
01:42:25.389,01:42:27.558,Your persistence surprises even me.
01:42:29.435,01:42:31.729,You're going to give mercenaries a bad name.
01:42:31.813,01:42:33.481,Dr. Jones...
01:42:36.734,01:42:39.152,surely you don't think you can escape from this island.
01:42:39.236,01:42:41.530,That depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be.
01:42:41.614,01:42:42.865,All I want is the girl.
01:42:48.496,01:42:49.914,If we refuse?
01:42:51.290,01:42:53.042,Then your Fuhrer has no prize.
01:42:54.460,01:42:55.586,"Okay, stand back."
01:42:55.670,01:42:56.796,"All of you, stand back."
01:42:56.879,01:42:58.756,Stand back.
01:42:58.840,01:43:00.591,"Okay, Jones."
01:43:00.675,01:43:02.802,You win!
01:43:02.885,01:43:03.719,Blow it up.
01:43:10.392,01:43:13.771,"Yes, blow it up!"
01:43:13.855,01:43:15.106,Blow it back to God.
01:43:16.482,01:43:20.903,All your life has been spent in pursuit of archeological relics.
01:43:20.987,01:43:25.116,Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.
01:43:25.198,01:43:27.118,You want to see it open as well as I.
01:43:29.537,01:43:31.831,Indiana...
01:43:31.914,01:43:34.042,we are simply passing through history.
01:43:36.002,01:43:37.210,This...
01:43:39.714,01:43:41.298,This is history.
01:43:51.559,01:43:53.102,Do as you will.
01:46:28.883,01:46:30.676,"Marion, don't look at it."
01:46:30.759,01:46:31.927,"Shut your eyes, Marion."
01:46:32.011,01:46:33.386,"Don't look at it, no matter what happens."
01:46:45.107,01:46:46.317,Ah...
01:47:02.083,01:47:03.709,It's beautiful!
01:47:14.803,01:47:15.971,Indy?
01:47:16.055,01:47:17.139,"Don't look, Marion!"
01:47:17.223,01:47:18.266,Keep your eyes shut!
01:48:36.593,01:48:37.552,Marion.
01:49:10.627,01:49:14.215,"You've done your country a great service, and we thank you."
01:49:14.298,01:49:17.801,And we trust you found the settlement satisfactory.
01:49:17.885,01:49:19.011,"Oh, the money's fine."
01:49:19.094,01:49:20.929,The situation's totally unacceptable.
01:49:21.013,01:49:23.224,"Well, gentlemen, I guess that just about wraps it up."
01:49:23.307,01:49:27.186,Where is the Ark?
01:49:27.269,01:49:28.979,I thought we'd settled that.
01:49:29.063,01:49:31.648,The Ark is somewhere very safe.
01:49:31.732,01:49:32.941,From whom?
01:49:33.025,01:49:37.738,The Ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched.
01:49:37.821,01:49:42.659,"And it will be, I assure you, Dr. Brody, Dr. Jones."
01:49:42.743,01:49:45.996,We have top men working on it right now.
