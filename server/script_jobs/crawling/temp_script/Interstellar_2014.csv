00:01:55.823,00:01:58.326,-I thought you were the ghost. -No.

00:02:02.164,00:02:04.332,Grandpa says you can get ghosts.
00:02:05.792,00:02:10.505,Maybe that's because Grandpa's close to being one himself. Back to bed.
00:02:10.838,00:02:12.674,Were you dreaming about the crash?
00:02:14.134,00:02:16.428,"Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh."

00:02:45.790,00:02:48.125,The blight came and we had to burn it.
00:02:49.001,00:02:51.713,And we still had corn. We had acres of corn.
00:02:51.879,00:02:54.173,"But, uh, mostly we had dust."
00:02:56.551,00:02:59.178,WOMAN 2: I guess I can't describe it. It was just constant.
00:02:59.346,00:03:01.848,Just that steady blow...
00:03:02.014,00:03:03.225,...of dirt.

00:03:08.563,00:03:11.316,...sometimes over our nose and mouth...
00:03:11.483,00:03:13.985,...so that we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

00:03:18.365,00:03:21.243,"...upside-down. Glasses or cups, whatever it was..."

00:03:30.418,00:03:33.880,"Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn, Herbicide Resistance 101."
00:03:34.046,00:03:35.548,"-Check? -Yes, sir."
00:03:36.841,00:03:38.510,"Not at the table, Murph."
00:03:39.261,00:03:41.095,"Dad, can you fix this?"

00:03:44.181,00:03:45.350,-...to my lander? -Wasn't me.
00:03:45.517,00:03:47.394,Let me guess. It was your ghost?
00:03:47.560,00:03:49.896,It knocked it off. It keeps knocking books off.
00:03:50.062,00:03:51.564,"TOM: No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass."
00:03:51.689,00:03:52.690,-Hey.
00:03:52.774,00:03:53.900,-I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.

00:03:55.443,00:03:57.362,"Well, it's not very scientific, Murph."
00:03:57.529,00:03:59.864,You said science was about admitting what we don't know.
00:04:00.031,00:04:02.199,-She's got you there. -Hey.
00:04:02.367,00:04:03.868,Start looking after our stuff.
00:04:05.495,00:04:06.704,Coop.
00:04:09.499,00:04:11.668,"All right, Murph, you want to talk science?"
00:04:12.627,00:04:15.880,"Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost. No, you got to go further."
00:04:16.047,00:04:19.216,"You got to record the facts, analyze, get to the how and the why..."
00:04:19.384,00:04:22.304,...then present your conclusions. Deal?
00:04:22.970,00:04:24.389,-Deal. -All right.

00:04:56.253,00:04:57.755,What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:15.773,00:05:16.983,Uh-huh.
00:05:17.567,00:05:18.943,Third.

00:05:41.048,00:05:42.467,COOPER: You got to figure it out.
00:05:42.634,00:05:44.719,I'm not always gonna be here to help you.
00:05:53.019,00:05:54.771,"What's going on, Murph?"
00:05:54.937,00:05:58.149,Why did you and Mom name me after something that's bad?
00:05:58.315,00:05:59.692,We didn't.
00:06:00.067,00:06:01.569,Murphy's Law?
00:06:02.529,00:06:06.616,Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen.
00:06:06.783,00:06:10.161,What it means is whatever can happen will happen.
00:06:10.327,00:06:12.872,And that sounded just fine with us.
00:06:17.084,00:06:18.628,Whoa!
00:06:19.211,00:06:20.505,Get in.
00:06:21.881,00:06:23.299,"Get in, let's go."
00:06:24.634,00:06:26.761,What about the flat tire?
00:06:29.722,00:06:31.057,Yeah.
00:06:45.029,00:06:49.033,It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.
00:06:49.200,00:06:50.660,"Take the wheel, Tom."
00:06:56.123,00:06:57.459,"Go, go, go!"
00:06:59.043,00:07:00.712,Keep that aimed right at it.
00:07:08.636,00:07:11.055,"Faster, Tom. I'm losing it."
00:07:11.723,00:07:12.765,Right at it.
00:07:14.266,00:07:15.309,Stay on it.
00:07:16.894,00:07:17.979,Here we go.
00:07:20.898,00:07:22.108,Whoa.
00:07:27.238,00:07:28.823,"Nice one, Tom."
00:07:35.287,00:07:36.664,Dad?
00:07:37.081,00:07:39.834,I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!
00:07:40.334,00:07:41.377,Dad!
00:07:41.711,00:07:42.920,Tom!
00:07:47.467,00:07:49.802,You told me to keep driving.
00:07:50.637,00:07:55.099,"Well, I guess that answers the old If I asked you to drive off a cliff scenario."
00:07:58.310,00:08:01.147,"-We lost it. -No, we didn't."
00:08:13.826,00:08:15.495,Want to give it a whirl?
00:08:21.501,00:08:22.877,This way.
00:08:28.257,00:08:29.341,Go.
00:08:30.342,00:08:33.345,Let's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir.
00:08:37.642,00:08:39.351,Nicely done.
00:08:42.354,00:08:44.231,TOM: How long you think it's been up there?
00:08:44.398,00:08:46.943,"COOPER: Delhi Mission Control went down, same as ours..."
00:08:47.109,00:08:48.945,-...ten years ago. -Heh.
00:08:49.278,00:08:51.197,So for ten years?
00:08:54.158,00:08:56.786,-Why did it come down so low? -I don't know.
00:08:56.953,00:08:59.872,Maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something.
00:09:00.039,00:09:02.291,-What? -Give me a large flatblade.
00:09:02.709,00:09:05.377,Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.
00:09:10.633,00:09:12.134,What are you gonna do with it?
00:09:13.052,00:09:16.222,I'm gonna give it something socially responsible to do...
00:09:17.098,00:09:18.432,...like drive a combine.
00:09:19.016,00:09:20.517,Can't we just let it go?
00:09:22.812,00:09:24.480,It wasn't hurting anybody.
00:09:26.148,00:09:28.651,"This thing needs to learn how to adapt, Murph..."
00:09:28.943,00:09:30.444,...like the rest of us.
00:09:35.074,00:09:36.743,COOPER: How's this work? You guys come with?
00:09:36.909,00:09:37.994,TOM: I've got class.
00:09:38.410,00:09:40.747,This one needs to wait.
00:09:42.331,00:09:45.084,-What did you do? -They'll tell you about it in there.
00:09:45.251,00:09:47.419,-Am I gonna be mad? -Not with me.
00:09:47.587,00:09:50.757,-Just please try not to. -Hey. Relax.
00:09:52.216,00:09:53.550,I got this.
00:09:57.764,00:09:59.098,"Little late, Coop."
00:09:59.265,00:10:00.767,"Yeah, we had a flat."
00:10:00.933,00:10:04.520,And I guess you had to stop off at the Asian fighter plane store.
00:10:04.771,00:10:08.399,"No, actually, sir, that's a surveillance drone."
00:10:08.565,00:10:11.277,With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.
00:10:11.736,00:10:13.070,Take a seat.
00:10:14.196,00:10:15.698,"So, uh..."
00:10:16.407,00:10:18.951,...we got Tom's scores back.
00:10:19.535,00:10:21.453,He's going to make an excellent farmer.
00:10:21.621,00:10:25.124,"Yeah, he's got a knack for it. What about college?"
00:10:25.291,00:10:31.547,The university only takes a handful. They don't have the resources to-- I still pay my taxes.
00:10:31.714,00:10:33.716,Where's that money go? There's no more armies.
00:10:34.216,00:10:36.552,"Well, it doesn't go to the university."
00:10:37.136,00:10:38.763,"Look, Coop, you have to be realistic."
00:10:38.930,00:10:41.724,You're ruling my son out for college now?
00:10:42.266,00:10:45.770,-The kid's 15. -Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
00:10:46.771,00:10:48.940,"What's your waistline? About what, 32?"
00:10:49.315,00:10:50.983,-About a 33 inseam?
00:10:51.067,00:10:52.985,-I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
00:10:53.152,00:10:57.614,It takes two numbers to measure your ass but only one to measure my son's future?
00:10:58.490,00:11:01.327,"Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop."
00:11:01.493,00:11:03.495,-And a trained pilot. -And an engineer.
00:11:03.996,00:11:08.209,"Okay, well, right now we don't need more engineers."
00:11:09.168,00:11:13.505,We didn't run out of television screens and planes. We ran out of food.
00:11:13.840,00:11:17.301,"The world needs farmers. Good farmers, like you."
00:11:17.468,00:11:19.846,-And Tom. -Uneducated farmers.
00:11:20.763,00:11:24.683,"We're a caretaker generation, Coop. And things are getting better."
00:11:24.851,00:11:28.270,"-Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin-- -Are we done here, sir?"
00:11:29.271,00:11:30.356,No.
00:11:31.190,00:11:33.359,Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.
00:11:33.692,00:11:36.195,HANLEY: Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.
00:11:36.362,00:11:38.655,But she's been having a little trouble lately.
00:11:38.823,00:11:42.201,She brought this in to show the students. The section on the lunar landings.
00:11:42.368,00:11:44.871,"Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks."
00:11:45.329,00:11:47.331,She always loved the pictures.
00:11:47.498,00:11:51.210,It's an old federal textbook. We've replaced them with the corrected versions.
00:11:51.377,00:11:52.378,Corrected?
00:11:52.544,00:11:56.715,Explaining how the Apollo missions were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.
00:12:03.389,00:12:05.391,You don't believe we went to the moon?
00:12:06.517,00:12:08.519,It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.
00:12:08.685,00:12:11.522,The Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources...
00:12:11.688,00:12:13.900,...into rockets and other useless machines.
00:12:14.066,00:12:15.192,Useless machines.
00:12:15.359,00:12:19.405,"If we don't want a repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century, then..."
00:12:19.571,00:12:23.409,"...we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it."
00:12:24.243,00:12:28.247,One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI.
00:12:28.580,00:12:31.918,"If we had any of those left, the doctors would've been able to find..."
00:12:32.084,00:12:35.880,...the cyst in my wife's brain before she died instead of afterwards.
00:12:36.047,00:12:39.091,Then she'd have been the one listening to this instead of me...
00:12:39.258,00:12:42.386,"...which would have been a good thing, because she was always..."
00:12:42.929,00:12:44.430,...the calmer one.
00:12:45.097,00:12:47.224,"I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper."
00:12:48.434,00:12:52.104,But Murph got into a fistfight with several of her classmates over this...
00:12:52.271,00:12:53.940,...Apollo nonsense.
00:12:54.106,00:12:56.608,So we thought it best to bring you in and see what ideas...
00:12:56.775,00:12:59.445,...you might have for dealing with her behavior on the home front.
00:13:00.612,00:13:03.699,"Yeah, you know what? Um, there's a game tomorrow night."
00:13:03.866,00:13:05.952,She's going through a bit of a baseball phase.
00:13:06.118,00:13:10.372,Her favorite team is playing. There's gonna be candy and soda and....
00:13:13.459,00:13:15.294,I think I'll take her to that.
00:13:20.632,00:13:21.884,How'd it go?
00:13:22.801,00:13:24.636,I got you suspended.
00:13:28.140,00:13:29.308,This is Cooper. Go.
00:13:29.475,00:13:32.311,"Coop, those combines you rebuilt went haywire."
00:13:32.478,00:13:34.646,Just reset the controllers.
00:13:34.981,00:13:37.649,I did that. Now you should come take a look.
00:13:57.336,00:14:00.339,MAN: One by one they've been peeling off the fields and heading over.
00:14:00.506,00:14:02.341,Something's interfering with the compass.
00:14:03.842,00:14:06.262,Magnetism or some such.
00:14:49.180,00:14:50.847,MURPH: Nothing special about which book.
00:14:51.515,00:14:53.725,"I've been working on it, like you said."
00:14:54.518,00:14:57.021,-I counted the spaces. -Why?
00:14:59.065,00:15:01.150,In case the ghost is trying to communicate.
00:15:01.901,00:15:03.485,I'm trying Morse.
00:15:04.070,00:15:05.321,Morse?
00:15:05.654,00:15:06.738,Yeah.
00:15:07.156,00:15:09.741,"-Dots and dashes, used-- -I know what Morse code is, Murph."
00:15:09.909,00:15:12.869,I just don't think your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.
00:15:24.423,00:15:28.844,Had to reset every compass clock and GPS to offset for the anomaly.
00:15:29.095,00:15:31.680,-Which is? -I don't know.
00:15:33.432,00:15:35.601,If the house was built on magnetic ore...
00:15:35.767,00:15:38.854,...we'd have seen this the first time we switched on the tractor.
00:15:41.523,00:15:44.693,I hear your meeting at the school didn't go so well.
00:15:45.277,00:15:47.029,Heh. You heard?
00:15:47.947,00:15:50.782,"It's like we've forgotten who we are, Donald."
00:15:52.451,00:15:55.955,"Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers."
00:15:57.706,00:15:59.291,When I was a kid...
00:15:59.458,00:16:03.629,...it felt like they made something new every day. Some...
00:16:03.963,00:16:07.299,...gadget or idea. Like every day was Christmas.
00:16:07.758,00:16:10.427,But six billion people...
00:16:10.802,00:16:12.804,...just try to imagine that.
00:16:13.805,00:16:16.808,And every last one of them trying to have it all.
00:16:20.229,00:16:22.148,This world isn't so bad.
00:16:24.400,00:16:26.610,And Tom will do just fine.
00:16:26.777,00:16:28.445,You're the one who doesn't belong.
00:16:28.529,00:16:31.157,"Born 40 years too late, or 40 years too early."
00:16:32.158,00:16:34.660,"My daughter knew it, God bless her."
00:16:35.494,00:16:38.330,And your kids know it. Especially Murph.
00:16:38.664,00:16:42.084,"Well, we used to look up in the sky and wonder..."
00:16:42.251,00:16:44.628,...at our place in the stars.
00:16:47.006,00:16:51.427,Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
00:16:51.927,00:16:54.763,"Cooper, you were good at something..."
00:16:55.097,00:16:57.599,...and you never got a chance to do anything with it.
00:16:58.350,00:16:59.685,I'm sorry.
00:17:01.437,00:17:02.854,WOMAN 4: You didn't expect...
00:17:03.022,00:17:05.524,...this dirt that was giving you this food...
00:17:05.857,00:17:08.985,...to turn on you like that and destroy you.
00:17:09.486,00:17:13.615,"In April-- I believe I'm right-- Fifteenth of April, I think."
00:17:14.033,00:17:16.368,This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
00:17:16.702,00:17:18.454,...came off the top of that canyon.
00:17:20.164,00:17:22.291,"In my day, we had real ballplayers."
00:17:22.458,00:17:24.210,Who are these bums?
00:17:24.543,00:17:27.046,"COOPER: In my day, people were too busy..."
00:17:27.213,00:17:29.298,...fighting over food to even play baseball.
00:17:29.548,00:17:34.470,Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural. I want a hot dog.
00:17:34.636,00:17:36.722,School says you're gonna follow in my footsteps.
00:17:37.514,00:17:39.015,I think that's great.
00:17:39.308,00:17:42.561,"-You think that's great? -You hate farming, Dad."
00:17:43.395,00:17:45.021,Grandpa said.
00:17:45.189,00:17:46.565,"COOPER: Grandpa said, huh?"
00:17:47.023,00:17:49.568,"Listen, all that matters is how you feel about it."
00:17:49.735,00:17:51.403,I like what you do.
00:17:52.071,00:17:53.572,I like our farm.
00:17:54.240,00:17:55.907,You're gonna be great at it.
00:18:08.754,00:18:10.256,Let's get out of here.
00:18:17.513,00:18:19.515,"COOPER: All right, it's a doozy."
00:18:20.224,00:18:22.058,"All right, gang, let's mask up."
00:18:25.396,00:18:27.398,-Tom? Murph? Check? TOM: Yeah.
00:19:20.951,00:19:23.495,"Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?"
00:19:27.958,00:19:29.000,Murph?
00:19:50.439,00:19:51.690,MURPH: The ghost.
00:19:52.983,00:19:54.610,Grab your pillow.
00:19:55.361,00:19:57.196,You're sleeping in with Tom.
00:20:52.167,00:20:53.835,COOPER: It's not a ghost.
00:20:59.258,00:21:00.676,It's gravity.
00:21:02.428,00:21:04.680,"DONALD: I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town."
00:21:04.930,00:21:09.100,You want to clean that up when you've finished praying to it?
00:21:34.460,00:21:36.753,"It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary."
00:21:37.253,00:21:39.214,"Thick is one, thin is zero."
00:21:43.635,00:21:44.970,Coordinates.
00:21:47.598,00:21:50.100,Nope. Mm-mm.
00:21:51.560,00:21:52.728,Here we go.
00:21:54.313,00:21:55.647,Thirty-three.
00:21:58.650,00:21:59.651,That's it.
00:22:01.152,00:22:02.654,I can't miss this!
00:22:02.988,00:22:06.157,"Grandpa will be back in a couple hours, Murph."
00:22:06.950,00:22:09.620,But you don't know what you're gonna find.
00:22:10.621,00:22:11.955,And that...
00:22:12.998,00:22:15.125,...is why I can't take you.
00:22:21.172,00:22:22.341,Murph?
00:22:24.426,00:22:27.929,Grandpa will be home in a while. Tell him I'll call him on the radio.
00:22:34.102,00:22:35.353,-Aah! -Jesus.
00:22:36.354,00:22:38.273,-What are you doing? -Heh-heh.
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.526,"Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?"
00:22:40.859,00:22:43.194,You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.
00:22:45.030,00:22:47.032,Make yourself useful.
00:23:53.389,00:23:54.432,Murph!
00:23:57.936,00:24:00.271,I think this is the end of the road.
00:24:03.274,00:24:05.276,Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?
00:24:06.444,00:24:07.738,That's my girl.
00:24:35.473,00:24:36.725,MAN'S VOICE: Step away!
00:24:36.892,00:24:39.978,COOPER: Don't shoot! I'm not armed. My daughter's in the car.
00:24:45.483,00:24:47.778,MAN'S VOICE: Don't be afraid. -Aah!
00:25:00.498,00:25:02.584,MAN'S VOICE: How did you find this place?
00:25:03.293,00:25:04.628,Where's my daughter?
00:25:04.920,00:25:07.589,You had the coordinates for this facility marked on your map.
00:25:07.673,00:25:08.924,Where did you get them?
00:25:09.007,00:25:10.341,Where's my daughter?
00:25:10.508,00:25:13.428,Don't make me take you down again. Sit down!
00:25:13.762,00:25:15.972,"COOPER: Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?"
00:25:16.139,00:25:18.684,Marines don't exist anymore.
00:25:19.017,00:25:22.062,-And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
00:25:22.145,00:25:23.980,-Where did you find those coordinates?
00:25:24.147,00:25:26.692,But you don't look much like a lawnmower.
00:25:26.858,00:25:29.695,Think I'll turn you into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.
00:25:29.861,00:25:31.112,"WOMAN: No, you won't."
00:25:32.698,00:25:34.658,"TARS, back down, please."
00:25:36.159,00:25:39.287,"You know, you're taking a risk using ex-military security."
00:25:39.705,00:25:43.541,"They're old, and their control units are unpredictable."
00:25:43.709,00:25:45.711,It's what the government could spare.
00:25:47.378,00:25:48.546,Who are you?
00:25:49.047,00:25:50.381,Dr. Brand.
00:25:50.548,00:25:52.884,I knew a Dr. Brand once. He was a professor.
00:25:53.301,00:25:54.803,What makes you think I'm not?
00:25:55.220,00:25:57.555,"Wasn't near as cute, either."
00:25:57.889,00:26:00.391,"Please, Dr. Brand. I don't have any idea what this is."
00:26:01.226,00:26:03.729,Now I'm scared for my daughter and want her by my side.
00:26:03.895,00:26:06.397,"You give me that, I'll tell you anything you want to know."
00:26:09.735,00:26:12.738,"Get the principals and the girl in the conference room, please."
00:26:14.072,00:26:15.490,Your daughter is fine.
00:26:15.907,00:26:16.992,Bright kid.
00:26:17.575,00:26:19.410,Must have a very smart mother.
00:26:19.577,00:26:21.997,It's pretty clear you don't want any visitors.
00:26:22.163,00:26:26.084,So why don't you just let us back up from your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?
00:26:26.417,00:26:28.920,"-It's not that simple. -Well, sure, it is."
00:26:29.254,00:26:32.924,I don't know anything about you. I don't know anything about this place.
00:26:33.842,00:26:35.010,"Yes, you do."
00:26:40.724,00:26:41.767,Dad!
00:26:44.435,00:26:45.520,"Hello, Cooper."
00:26:46.938,00:26:48.023,Professor Brand.
00:26:50.191,00:26:52.110,MAN: Explain to me how you found this facility.
00:26:52.277,00:26:58.449,Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled upon it. We were on a salvage run-- You're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world.
00:26:58.616,00:27:02.120,Nobody stumbles in here. Nobody stumbles out.
00:27:02.453,00:27:04.122,"BRAND: Cooper, please."
00:27:04.622,00:27:06.708,Cooperate with these people.
00:27:06.875,00:27:08.084,Look.
00:27:08.960,00:27:10.628,It's kind of hard to explain.
00:27:10.962,00:27:15.133,We learned these coordinates from an anomaly.
00:27:15.926,00:27:17.260,What sort of anomaly?
00:27:17.427,00:27:20.722,"I hesitate to term it supernatural, but it definitely wasn't scientific."
00:27:20.889,00:27:24.810,"You're going to have to be specific, Mr. Cooper. Right now."
00:27:24.976,00:27:26.227,It was gravity.
00:27:29.898,00:27:34.110,"Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly? Where was this?"
00:27:34.277,00:27:37.572,"Now, I'm real happy that you're excited about gravity, bud..."
00:27:37.739,00:27:40.951,...but you're not getting any answers from us until I get assurances.
00:27:41.117,00:27:42.410,-Assurances? COOPER: Yeah.
00:27:43.244,00:27:46.664,"Like, that we're getting out of here. And I don't mean in the trunk of some car."
00:27:49.250,00:27:51.336,"Don't you know who we are, Coop?"
00:27:51.502,00:27:52.796,"No, professor, I don't."
00:27:52.963,00:27:54.965,"WOMAN: You know my father, Professor Brand."
00:27:55.590,00:27:56.842,We're NASA.
00:27:58.676,00:28:00.846,-NASA? BRAND: NASA.
00:28:01.179,00:28:03.014,The same NASA you flew for.
00:28:14.025,00:28:15.693,"COOPER: I heard they shut you down, sir..."
00:28:15.861,00:28:18.196,...for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere...
00:28:18.363,00:28:19.865,...onto starving people.
00:28:20.031,00:28:22.367,When they realized that killing other people was...
00:28:22.533,00:28:25.370,"...not a long-term solution, then they needed us back."
00:28:25.536,00:28:27.538,-In secret. -Why secret?
00:28:27.705,00:28:31.542,BRAND: Because public opinion wouldn't allow spending on space exploration.
00:28:32.043,00:28:34.337,Not while you're struggling to put food on the table.
00:28:35.713,00:28:36.882,Blight.
00:28:37.382,00:28:41.219,Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.
00:28:41.970,00:28:43.638,Now there's just corn.
00:28:43.972,00:28:45.891,And we're growing more than we ever have.
00:28:46.057,00:28:50.228,But like the potatoes in Ireland and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...
00:28:50.854,00:28:53.356,...the corn will die.
00:28:54.065,00:28:55.150,Soon.
00:29:00.405,00:29:04.034,"We'll find a way, professor. We always have."
00:29:04.743,00:29:08.747,Driven by the unshakable faith the Earth is ours.
00:29:09.247,00:29:11.166,"Not just ours, no."
00:29:11.917,00:29:13.251,But it is our home.
00:29:14.585,00:29:17.923,Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
00:29:18.089,00:29:19.841,We don't even breathe nitrogen.
00:29:20.008,00:29:25.346,"Blight does. And as it thrives, our air gets less and less oxygen."
00:29:25.513,00:29:28.934,The last people to starve will be the first to suffocate.
00:29:29.100,00:29:31.269,And your daughter's generation...
00:29:32.938,00:29:35.231,...will be the last to survive on Earth.
00:29:35.398,00:29:38.944,WOMAN: Murph is tired. I was wondering if she could take a nap in my office.
00:29:39.444,00:29:40.946,Yeah. Thank you.
00:29:43.782,00:29:44.783,Okay...
00:29:45.784,00:29:49.287,...now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world.
00:29:49.955,00:29:53.458,We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it.
00:29:59.297,00:30:00.381,COOPER: Rangers.
00:30:00.631,00:30:05.636,"The last components of our one versatile ship in orbit, the Endurance."
00:30:05.929,00:30:07.555,Our final expedition.
00:30:08.306,00:30:11.309,You sent people out there looking for a new home?
00:30:11.935,00:30:13.228,The Lazarus missions.
00:30:13.561,00:30:16.481,"-Oh, that sounds cheerful. -Lazarus came back from the dead."
00:30:16.815,00:30:18.817,"Sure, but he had to die in the first place."
00:30:19.484,00:30:22.153,There's not a planet in our solar system that could sustain life...
00:30:22.320,00:30:24.823,...and the nearest star's over a thousand years away.
00:30:24.990,00:30:27.658,That doesn't even qualify as futile.
00:30:29.327,00:30:30.661,Where'd you send them?
00:30:31.121,00:30:32.497,Cooper...
00:30:32.663,00:30:35.500,...I can't tell you anymore unless you agree...
00:30:35.666,00:30:37.502,...to pilot this craft.
00:30:37.668,00:30:40.964,-You're the best pilot we ever had. -I barely left the stratosphere.
00:30:41.256,00:30:43.341,This team never left the simulator.
00:30:43.674,00:30:47.512,"We need a pilot, and this is the mission that you were trained for."
00:30:47.678,00:30:49.180,Without even knowing it?
00:30:50.181,00:30:54.477,"An hour ago, you didn't even know I was alive. You were going anyway."
00:30:54.644,00:30:56.354,We had no choice.
00:30:56.521,00:30:58.273,But something sent you here.
00:30:58.606,00:31:01.317,-They chose you. -Who's they?
00:31:09.284,00:31:11.202,How long would I be gone?
00:31:11.786,00:31:14.705,Hard to know. Years?
00:31:15.373,00:31:17.042,"I've got kids, professor."
00:31:17.542,00:31:19.544,Get out there and save them.
00:31:22.964,00:31:24.340,Who's they?
00:31:24.507,00:31:28.303,We started detecting gravitational anomalies almost 50 years ago.
00:31:28.636,00:31:32.223,Mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere.
00:31:32.390,00:31:35.560,"In fact, I believe you encountered one yourself."
00:31:36.227,00:31:38.229,"Yeah, over the Straights."
00:31:39.230,00:31:42.233,My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.
00:31:42.400,00:31:43.651,Exactly.
00:31:44.485,00:31:51.576,"But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this: Out near Saturn..."
00:31:51.742,00:31:53.828,...a disturbance of space-time.
00:31:55.914,00:31:59.084,-Is that a wormhole? -It appeared 48 years ago.
00:31:59.542,00:32:01.419,And it leads where?
00:32:02.003,00:32:03.588,Another galaxy.
00:32:05.381,00:32:07.592,A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.
00:32:07.758,00:32:09.219,Someone placed it there.
00:32:10.011,00:32:11.512,-They? -Mm.
00:32:12.013,00:32:16.101,"And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us."
00:32:16.559,00:32:19.104,That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
00:32:19.270,00:32:21.231,It came along right as we needed it.
00:32:21.397,00:32:24.275,They've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach.
00:32:24.442,00:32:26.402,"Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes."
00:32:26.569,00:32:28.947,-You sent probes into that? -Mm-hm.
00:32:29.114,00:32:32.117,We sent people into it. Ten years ago.
00:32:33.451,00:32:35.120,The Lazarus missions.
00:32:35.453,00:32:36.621,BRAND: Twelve possible worlds...
00:32:36.787,00:32:39.124,...twelve Ranger launches carrying...
00:32:39.624,00:32:42.043,...the bravest humans ever to live...
00:32:42.210,00:32:44.795,...led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.
00:32:45.296,00:32:48.299,Each person's landing pod had enough life support for two years.
00:32:48.466,00:32:50.468,But they could use hibernation to stretch that...
00:32:50.635,00:32:53.804,...making observations on organics over a decade or more.
00:32:53.972,00:32:57.808,"Their mission was to assess their world, and if it showed potential..."
00:32:58.143,00:33:02.522,"...then they could send out a signal, bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued."
00:33:02.772,00:33:04.815,And what if the world didn't show promise?
00:33:05.441,00:33:06.817,Hence the bravery.
00:33:07.652,00:33:10.155,You don't have the resources to visit all 12.
00:33:10.321,00:33:11.489,No.
00:33:12.323,00:33:15.160,Data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary.
00:33:15.326,00:33:20.331,Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us some clue as to which worlds have potential.
00:33:20.498,00:33:22.333,And one system shows promise.
00:33:22.667,00:33:25.170,"One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?"
00:33:26.004,00:33:28.839,One system with three potential worlds?
00:33:29.299,00:33:30.841,No long shot.
00:33:33.011,00:33:34.179,Okay.
00:33:34.845,00:33:37.182,So if we find a home...
00:33:39.850,00:33:43.354,-...then what? -That's the long shot.
00:33:43.688,00:33:46.857,There's a Plan A and a Plan B.
00:33:47.358,00:33:50.361,Did you notice anything strange about the launch chamber?
00:34:02.040,00:34:05.000,COOPER: This entire facility's a centrifuge.
00:34:05.335,00:34:07.837,Some kind of vehicle. A space station?
00:34:08.171,00:34:09.880,BRAND: Both. Plan A.
00:34:10.048,00:34:12.175,How do you get it off the ground?
00:34:12.342,00:34:16.011,The first gravitational anomalies changed everything.
00:34:16.346,00:34:20.683,Suddenly we knew that harnessing gravity was real.
00:34:21.016,00:34:25.688,So I started working on a theory and we started building this station.
00:34:26.064,00:34:28.149,But you haven't solved it yet.
00:34:29.234,00:34:30.735,That's why there's Plan B.
00:34:31.236,00:34:35.990,The problem is gravity. How to get a viable amount of human life off the planet.
00:34:36.157,00:34:37.408,This is one way.
00:34:37.742,00:34:40.245,Plan B: a population bomb.
00:34:40.578,00:34:45.375,"Over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos."
00:34:46.084,00:34:47.585,How would you raise them?
00:34:47.752,00:34:50.213,"With equipment on board, we incubate the first 10."
00:34:50.380,00:34:54.259,"After that, with surrogacy, the growth becomes exponential."
00:34:54.925,00:34:58.263,"Within 30 years, we could have a colony of hundreds."
00:34:58.429,00:35:01.766,The real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity.
00:35:02.433,00:35:03.934,This takes care of that.
00:35:04.102,00:35:06.604,But what about the people here? You just...
00:35:06.937,00:35:08.273,...give up on them?
00:35:08.939,00:35:10.191,My kids?
00:35:10.733,00:35:14.069,That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.
00:35:16.281,00:35:19.200,-How far have you got? -Almost there.
00:35:19.367,00:35:21.786,You're asking me to hang everything...
00:35:22.787,00:35:24.122,...on an almost.
00:35:24.705,00:35:26.957,I'm asking you to trust me.
00:35:30.085,00:35:31.754,Find us a new home.
00:35:32.463,00:35:34.465,And by the time you return...
00:35:35.090,00:35:37.760,...I will have solved the problem of gravity.
00:35:38.719,00:35:40.305,I give you my word.
00:35:52.942,00:35:54.444,MURPH: Go away!
00:36:05.120,00:36:06.164,Murph.
00:36:06.497,00:36:09.500,"MURPH: Go! If you're leaving, just go."
00:36:12.337,00:36:15.173,"DONALD: This world was never enough for you, was it, Coop?"
00:36:16.006,00:36:19.760,"What, because heading out there is what I feel like I was born to do?"
00:36:20.678,00:36:22.513,And it excites me? Heh.
00:36:23.264,00:36:25.683,"No, that does not make it wrong."
00:36:25.850,00:36:27.017,It might.
00:36:27.352,00:36:30.521,Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.
00:36:31.272,00:36:33.608,"The why of the thing, that's the foundation."
00:36:33.774,00:36:35.860,And the foundation's solid.
00:36:39.029,00:36:45.536,"We farmers, we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say: Next year."
00:36:46.204,00:36:49.874,"Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that."
00:36:50.708,00:36:54.879,"This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now."
00:36:59.550,00:37:03.388,"Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here."
00:37:06.516,00:37:09.727,"Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph."
00:37:09.894,00:37:10.895,I will.
00:37:11.896,00:37:15.065,Without making promises you don't know you can keep.
00:37:25.701,00:37:27.703,"You have to talk to me, Murph."
00:37:30.205,00:37:32.333,I need to fix this before I go.
00:37:32.500,00:37:35.378,MURPH: Then I'll keep it broken so you have to stay.
00:37:36.921,00:37:41.926,"After you kids came along, your mom said something to me I never quite understood."
00:37:42.343,00:37:43.928,"She said, Now..."
00:37:45.846,00:37:50.351,...we're just here to be memories for our kids.
00:37:55.440,00:37:57.942,And I think that now I understand what she meant.
00:38:01.737,00:38:05.450,"Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future."
00:38:07.117,00:38:09.287,You said ghosts didn't exist.
00:38:15.751,00:38:17.252,"That's right, Murph."
00:38:20.465,00:38:21.799,"Murph, look at me."
00:38:24.802,00:38:27.305,I can't be your ghost right now.
00:38:29.139,00:38:31.141,I need to exist.
00:38:32.768,00:38:34.645,They chose me.
00:38:35.396,00:38:39.317,"Murph, they chose me. You saw. You're the one who led me to them."
00:38:41.986,00:38:44.489,That's exactly why you can't go.
00:38:47.658,00:38:49.660,I figured out the message.
00:38:50.077,00:38:53.288,-One word. Know what it is? -Murph.
00:38:53.456,00:38:54.790,Stay.
00:38:55.165,00:38:58.002,"-It says, Stay, Dad. -Murph."
00:38:59.003,00:39:00.463,You don't believe me.
00:39:00.630,00:39:03.424,"Look at the books! Look at this. It says, Stay."
00:39:03.591,00:39:06.511,"Why--? You're not listening! It says, Stay!"
00:39:06.844,00:39:08.679,"No, I'm coming back."
00:39:08.846,00:39:10.180,When?
00:39:23.193,00:39:25.696,"One for you, one for me."
00:39:26.030,00:39:29.199,"When I'm up there in hypersleep, or..."
00:39:29.534,00:39:32.119,"...traveling near the speed of light, or..."
00:39:33.120,00:39:35.205,...near a black hole...
00:39:35.706,00:39:40.210,...time's gonna change for me. It's gonna run more slowly.
00:39:41.837,00:39:43.631,When we get back...
00:39:44.715,00:39:46.175,...we're gonna compare.
00:39:46.341,00:39:48.969,MURPH: Time will run differently for us? -Yeah.
00:39:50.054,00:39:54.725,"By the time I get back, we might even be the same age, you and me."
00:39:55.059,00:39:57.395,What? Imagine that!
00:40:01.982,00:40:03.150,"Aw, Murph...."
00:40:03.317,00:40:05.903,You have no idea when you're coming back.
00:40:07.738,00:40:09.239,No idea at all!
00:40:12.367,00:40:14.495,"Murph, don't-- Don't make me leave like this."
00:40:14.662,00:40:16.163,"Come on, Murph!"
00:40:16.664,00:40:18.999,"Don't make me leave like this, Murph!"
00:40:26.591,00:40:27.592,Hey...
00:40:28.175,00:40:29.510,...I love you.
00:40:29.885,00:40:31.762,Forever. You hear me?
00:40:32.262,00:40:35.433,"I love you forever, and I'm coming back."
00:40:41.271,00:40:42.607,I'm coming back.
00:41:00.791,00:41:02.960,-How'd it go? -Fine.
00:41:03.753,00:41:05.212,Just fine.
00:41:11.636,00:41:12.803,"I love you, Tom."
00:41:13.303,00:41:15.473,"-Travel safe, huh? -Yeah."
00:41:15.640,00:41:17.892,"You look after our place for me, all right?"
00:41:18.058,00:41:19.644,-All right? -Uh-huh.
00:41:24.148,00:41:26.066,"Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?"
00:41:26.150,00:41:27.735,You mean your truck?
00:41:29.069,00:41:30.655,I'll make sure they bring it back.
00:41:32.823,00:41:34.617,"Look after my kids, Donald!"
00:41:47.087,00:41:50.675,TARS: Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

00:42:42.560,00:42:46.230,Everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
00:42:48.148,00:42:51.401,They gave him a humor setting so he'd fit in better with his unit.
00:42:51.736,00:42:53.403,He thinks it relaxes us.
00:42:53.571,00:42:56.406,A giant sarcastic robot.
00:42:57.241,00:42:58.701,What a great idea!
00:42:58.868,00:43:01.579,TARS: I have a cue light I can use when I'm joking if you like.
00:43:01.746,00:43:02.747,That'd probably help.
00:43:02.913,00:43:06.876,You can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.
00:43:07.918,00:43:10.921,"-What's your humor setting, TARS? -That's 100 percent."

00:44:24.119,00:44:26.496,"Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?"
00:44:26.664,00:44:29.333,TARS: Ninety percent. -Ninety percent?

00:48:41.251,00:48:42.419,Well.
00:48:45.589,00:48:47.424,"Romilly? Hey, you okay?"
00:48:47.591,00:48:48.592,-Yeah. -You all right?
00:48:48.758,00:48:50.885,"Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute."
00:48:51.261,00:48:55.932,"We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec."
00:48:56.100,00:48:58.268,"-Hey, Brand? -Yeah?"
00:48:58.602,00:49:00.437,-Bring a lot. -Heh-heh-heh.
00:49:08.945,00:49:11.781,"Amelia, be safe."
00:49:12.116,00:49:15.619,"-Give my regards to Dr. Mann. -I will, Dad."
00:49:15.785,00:49:17.746,It looks good for your trajectory.
00:49:17.912,00:49:21.250,We've calculated two years to Saturn.
00:49:21.958,00:49:23.460,That's a lot of Dramamine.
00:49:24.211,00:49:26.630,"Look after my family, will you, please, sir?"
00:49:27.214,00:49:29.966,We'll be waiting for you when you get back.
00:49:30.467,00:49:34.304,"A little older, a little wiser, but happy to see you."
00:49:37.141,00:50:26.481,"BRAND: Do not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave at close of day Rage, rage against the dying of the light Though wise men at their end Know dark is right Because their words had forked No lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night Rage, rage against the dying of the light DOYLE: You good? ROMILLY: Yeah."
00:50:27.357,00:50:28.858,"Okay, thank you."
00:50:32.362,00:50:33.697,Here. Pills.
00:50:36.491,00:50:37.867,So alone.
00:50:38.368,00:50:40.370,We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.
00:50:40.537,00:50:41.871,"No, I mean them."
00:50:42.038,00:50:43.207,Hm?
00:50:43.373,00:50:46.668,"COOPER: It's a perfect planet, and we won't find another one like her."
00:50:47.211,00:50:50.505,"No, it's not like looking for a new condo."
00:50:51.631,00:50:53.800,The human race is going to be...
00:50:54.301,00:50:55.344,...adrift...
00:50:55.510,00:50:59.013,...desperate for a rock it can cling to while it catches its breath.
00:50:59.556,00:51:01.391,We need to find that rock.
00:51:01.725,00:51:04.478,And our three prospects are at the edge of what...
00:51:04.644,00:51:06.521,...might sustain human life.
00:51:07.021,00:51:09.483,Laura Miller's planet is first.
00:51:09.649,00:51:11.735,-Laura started our biology program. COOPER: Mm-hm.
00:51:16.740,00:51:19.909,"AMELIA: Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here. -Tell me about Edmunds."
00:51:20.744,00:51:23.538,"Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist."
00:51:25.832,00:51:28.168,"None of them had families, huh?"
00:51:29.211,00:51:32.088,No. No attachments. My father insisted.
00:51:32.256,00:51:35.759,They all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again.
00:51:35.925,00:51:37.927,I'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them.
00:51:38.094,00:51:40.013,-How about Mann? -Dr. Mann?
00:51:40.180,00:51:42.098,He's remarkable. He's the best of us.
00:51:42.266,00:51:46.603,He inspired 11 people to follow him on the loneliest journey in human history.
00:51:46.770,00:51:48.397,"Scientists, explorers."
00:51:48.563,00:51:52.609,"That's what I love. You know, out there we face great odds."
00:51:53.109,00:51:54.569,"Death, but..."
00:51:56.280,00:51:57.614,...not evil.
00:51:57.947,00:51:59.699,You don't think nature can be evil?
00:52:00.074,00:52:02.744,No. Formidable. Frightening. But...
00:52:03.537,00:52:05.539,"-...no, not evil. -Hm."
00:52:06.790,00:52:09.959,Is a lion evil because it rips a gazelle to shreds?
00:52:10.460,00:52:12.462,"Just what we take with us, then."
00:52:13.046,00:52:14.088,Yeah.
00:52:14.464,00:52:16.591,This crew represents the best of humanity.
00:52:16.758,00:52:17.926,"Even me, huh?"
00:52:18.092,00:52:20.094,"You know what? We agreed, 90 percent."
00:52:20.262,00:52:21.305,There you go.
00:52:21.763,00:52:24.140,-Don't stay up. -I'll be there in a minute.
00:52:24.308,00:52:28.312,"Just remember, Coop, you are literally wasting your breath."
00:52:34.984,00:52:38.154,"Hey, TARS? Let's go over that trajectory one more time."
00:52:38.488,00:52:40.156,TARS: Eight months to Mars.
00:52:40.657,00:52:43.493,Counter-orbital slingshot around. Fourteen months to Saturn.
00:52:43.660,00:52:45.119,Nothing's changed on that.
00:52:45.287,00:52:47.331,Just let me ask you something.
00:52:49.583,00:52:53.044,Dr. Brand and Edmunds-- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.
00:52:54.504,00:52:57.507,Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?
00:52:57.674,00:52:59.133,I wouldn't know.
00:52:59.301,00:53:02.304,Is that 90 percent wouldn't know or 10 percent wouldn't know?
00:53:02.471,00:53:05.599,"-I also have a discretion setting, Cooper. -Aah."
00:53:07.016,00:53:09.185,"But not a poker face, Slick."
00:53:21.531,00:53:22.824,"Hey, guys."
00:53:23.199,00:53:26.328,"Uh, Dad's about to go down for the long nap."
00:53:26.661,00:53:29.289,So I wanted to give you an update.
00:53:29.456,00:53:30.540,Uh....
00:53:31.124,00:53:34.836,The Earth looks amazing from here. Um....
00:53:35.379,00:53:38.214,You can't see any of the dust. Heh.
00:53:38.382,00:53:42.511,"Um, I really hope you guys are doing great."
00:53:42.844,00:53:44.137,I know you'll get this message.
00:53:44.220,00:53:46.973,Professor Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.
00:53:47.641,00:53:49.684,Know that I love you.
00:53:51.060,00:53:53.397,"-Is it him? DONALD: I don't think so, Murph."
00:54:00.320,00:54:01.988,You must be Donald.
00:54:04.198,00:54:05.367,"Hello, Murph."
00:54:06.075,00:54:08.077,Why are you in my dad's truck?
00:54:08.745,00:54:10.914,He wanted me to bring it for your brother.
00:54:11.665,00:54:13.833,He sent you a message.
00:54:16.920,00:54:18.922,She's pretty upset with him for leaving.
00:54:19.088,00:54:23.176,"If you record any messages, I can get them to transmit it to Cooper."
00:54:24.260,00:54:26.930,Murph is a bright spark.
00:54:27.931,00:54:30.434,Maybe I should fan the flame.
00:54:30.600,00:54:33.227,She's already making fools of her teachers.
00:54:33.395,00:54:36.230,So maybe she should come and make a fool out of you.
00:54:37.273,00:54:40.109,-So where are they? -Heading for Mars.
00:54:40.860,00:54:44.864,"The next time you hear from Cooper, they'll be coming up on Saturn."
00:55:26.656,00:55:29.826,...the administration wants me to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.
00:55:30.326,00:55:33.580,But they said I could start Advanced Agriculture a year early.
00:55:35.331,00:55:39.252,"All right, I got to go, Dad. Hope you're safe up there."
00:55:43.297,00:55:44.841,"DONALD: Um, sorry, Coop."
00:55:45.008,00:55:49.846,"I asked Murph to say hi, but she's as stubborn as her old man."
00:55:50.304,00:55:52.140,I'll try again next time.
00:56:07.155,00:56:08.698,"You all right, Rom?"
00:56:11.034,00:56:12.869,"This gets to me, Cooper."
00:56:13.036,00:56:14.704,This. This.
00:56:15.204,00:56:18.124,"Millimeters of aluminum, that's it, and then nothing..."
00:56:18.291,00:56:22.211,...out there for millions of miles won't kill us in seconds.
00:56:23.171,00:56:25.048,You know that some of the finest...
00:56:25.214,00:56:29.052,...solo yachtsmen in the world don't know how to swim?
00:56:29.678,00:56:32.847,"They don't know how. And if they go overboard, psst, they're done."
00:56:34.558,00:56:36.560,"We're explorers, Rom."
00:56:38.061,00:56:39.813,This is our boat.
00:56:39.979,00:56:41.064,Here.
00:57:08.216,00:57:09.926,"COOPER: This is from the, uh, relay probe?"
00:57:10.093,00:57:12.178,It was in orbit around the wormhole.
00:57:12.679,00:57:15.724,"This is the wormhole, and every time we'd come around..."
00:57:15.890,00:57:19.102,...we would receive images from the other side of the foreign galaxy.
00:57:19.436,00:57:21.563,"Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around."
00:57:21.730,00:57:22.772,Exactly.
00:57:22.939,00:57:27.444,"So we got a pretty good idea what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?"
00:57:28.570,00:57:29.904,Navigationally.
00:57:31.364,00:57:35.118,AMELIA: Guys? We'll be approaching the wormhole in about three hours.
00:57:41.458,00:57:42.542,"Hey, Coop?"
00:57:43.417,00:57:45.128,Can we stop the spinning?
00:57:45.294,00:57:46.420,Why?
00:57:46.588,00:57:48.923,Because we're close enough to see it now?
00:57:50.759,00:57:51.885,All right.
00:57:52.051,00:57:53.136,Thanks.
00:57:58.892,00:58:00.810,"There, that's it! That's the wormhole!"
00:58:00.977,00:58:02.812,"Say it, don't spray it, Rom."
00:58:03.146,00:58:04.481,It's a sphere.
00:58:04.648,00:58:08.610,"Of course it is. What, you--? You thought it would just be a hole?"
00:58:09.819,00:58:12.906,"No, it's just that all the illustrations I've ever seen, they...."
00:58:13.447,00:58:16.493,"ROMILLY: In the illustrations, they're trying to show you how it works."
00:58:17.243,00:58:21.080,So they say you want to go from here to there.
00:58:21.414,00:58:23.958,"-But it's too far, right? -Mm-hm."
00:58:24.125,00:58:28.922,"So a wormhole bends space like this, so you can take a shortcut through..."
00:58:29.255,00:58:30.840,...a higher dimension.
00:58:31.007,00:58:32.466,"Okay, so..."
00:58:32.801,00:58:36.763,"...to show that, they've turned three-dimensional space into two dimensions..."
00:58:36.846,00:58:40.850,"...which turns a wormhole into two dimensions, a circle."
00:58:41.017,00:58:43.269,What's a circle in three dimensions?
00:58:44.478,00:58:45.980,-A sphere. -Exactly.
00:58:46.355,00:58:47.857,A spherical hole.
00:58:48.441,00:58:51.277,But who put it there? Who do we have to thank?
00:58:51.695,00:58:56.365,"I'm not thanking anybody until we get out of here in one piece, Rom."
00:59:03.540,00:59:04.999,"COOPER: Any trick to this, Doyle?"
00:59:06.334,00:59:08.002,No one knows.
00:59:15.134,00:59:16.803,"The others made it, right?"
00:59:18.847,00:59:20.514,At least some of them.
00:59:52.421,00:59:55.592,Everybody ready to say goodbye to our solar system?
00:59:56.509,00:59:58.511,To our galaxy.
01:00:00.429,01:00:01.430,Here we go.
01:00:34.088,01:00:37.591,The controls won't work here. We're passing through the bulk.
01:00:37.759,01:00:42.138,It's space beyond our three dimensions. All you can do is record and observe.
01:00:53.316,01:00:54.400,What is that?
01:00:56.778,01:00:58.612,I think it's them.
01:00:58.947,01:01:00.782,Distorting space-time.
01:01:02.826,01:01:03.952,ROMILLY: Don't! Don't!
01:01:31.980,01:01:33.189,What was that?
01:01:36.192,01:01:37.694,The first handshake.
01:01:39.362,01:01:40.446,We're....
01:01:42.031,01:01:43.366,We're here.
01:02:03.720,01:02:06.014,DOYLE: So the lost communications came through.
01:02:06.180,01:02:09.058,-How? -The relay on this side cached them.
01:02:09.225,01:02:12.729,So years of basic data. No real surprises.
01:02:13.687,01:02:17.525,"Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up, as has Dr. Mann's. Um...."
01:02:17.691,01:02:19.819,Edmunds' went down three years ago.
01:02:19.986,01:02:21.195,Transmitter failure?
01:02:21.362,01:02:24.365,Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark.
01:02:24.532,01:02:26.242,"But Miller's still looks good though, right?"
01:02:26.409,01:02:28.745,-Because she's coming up fast. DOYLE: Mm-hm.
01:02:29.203,01:02:31.205,With one complication.
01:02:31.580,01:02:34.583,The planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.
01:02:34.751,01:02:37.420,COOPER: Gargantua? -It's what we're calling the black hole.
01:02:37.586,01:02:39.923,Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets both orbit it.
01:02:40.089,01:02:43.259,-And Miller's is on the horizon? ROMILLY: As a basketball around a hoop.
01:02:43.426,01:02:45.428,Landing there takes us dangerously close.
01:02:45.594,01:02:48.890,And a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
01:02:51.434,01:02:54.437,"Look, I could swing around that neutron star to decelerate."
01:02:54.603,01:02:56.522,"AMELIA: No, it's not that. It's time."
01:02:56.689,01:03:01.194,The gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to Earth's drastically.
01:03:01.778,01:03:02.946,How bad?
01:03:03.112,01:03:06.699,Every hour we spend on that planet will be...
01:03:07.575,01:03:09.743,...seven years back on Earth.
01:03:10.619,01:03:11.620,Jesus.
01:03:11.955,01:03:13.622,"Well, that's relativity, folks."
01:03:15.083,01:03:17.543,"Well, we can't just drop down there without...."
01:03:17.710,01:03:19.587,"Cooper, we have a mission."
01:03:19.753,01:03:22.298,"Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission, and our mission Plan A is..."
01:03:22.465,01:03:25.634,...to find a planet that can habitate the people that are living on Earth now.
01:03:25.802,01:03:28.637,You can't just think about your family. Now you have to think bigger.
01:03:28.805,01:03:32.058,"I am thinking about my family and millions of other families, okay?"
01:03:32.225,01:03:36.479,Plan A does not work if the people on Earth are dead by the time we pull it off.
01:03:37.771,01:03:39.440,No. It doesn't.
01:03:39.773,01:03:41.442,That's why there's a Plan B.
01:03:43.319,01:03:44.821,Okay. Cooper's right.
01:03:44.988,01:03:48.825,"We need to think of time as a resource, like oxygen and food. Going down will cost us."
01:03:51.244,01:03:52.411,"All right, look."
01:03:53.662,01:03:57.166,"Dr. Mann's data is promising, but it will take months to get there."
01:03:57.333,01:03:59.502,"And Edmunds', it's even further."
01:03:59.668,01:04:03.840,"Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has is very promising. It's water, it's organics...."
01:04:04.007,01:04:06.175,"-You don't find that every day. -No, you don't."
01:04:06.342,01:04:08.677,"And just think about the resources, including time..."
01:04:08.845,01:04:11.347,...that would be spent trying to get back here.
01:04:12.515,01:04:14.308,-Romilly... -Yeah?
01:04:14.475,01:04:18.312,...how far off from Miller's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift?
01:04:18.479,01:04:20.148,Just back from the cusp.
01:04:20.314,01:04:23.276,"All right, which is here, just outside of Miller's planet."
01:04:23.442,01:04:25.194,ROMILLY: Right. -Okay.
01:04:26.154,01:04:28.948,Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.
01:04:29.115,01:04:32.285,Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit around Miller's planet...
01:04:32.451,01:04:35.329,"...which would conserve fuel, but we would lose a lot of time..."
01:04:35.496,01:04:39.542,"...what if we take a wider orbit around Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet..."
01:04:39.708,01:04:42.211,"...outside of this time shift, to here?"
01:04:42.378,01:04:45.214,"Then we take the Ranger down, we get Miller, we get her samples."
01:04:45.381,01:04:48.051,"We come back, we analyze, we debrief. We're in, we're out."
01:04:48.217,01:04:50.553,"We lose a little fuel, but we save a whole lot of time."
01:04:50.719,01:04:52.555,-That'll work. -That's good.
01:04:52.721,01:04:55.224,There's no time for monkey business or chit-chat down there.
01:04:55.391,01:04:58.186,"So, TARS, you should definitely stay here."
01:04:58.352,01:05:00.563,"CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay."
01:05:00.729,01:05:04.358,"If we're talking about a couple years, I could use the time to research gravity."
01:05:04.525,01:05:07.486,"Observations from the wormhole, that's gold to Professor Brand."
01:05:07.653,01:05:09.322,"COOPER: TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua."
01:05:09.488,01:05:14.243,"Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting, but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet."
01:05:14.410,01:05:16.913,-You got it? TARS: I wouldn't leave you behind...
01:05:17.080,01:05:18.164,...Dr. Brand.
01:05:22.835,01:05:24.420,"COOPER: You ready, CASE? CASE: Yup."
01:05:25.421,01:05:28.925,"-You don't say much, do you? -TARS talks plenty for both of us."

01:05:44.607,01:05:46.775,A literal heart of darkness.
01:05:50.947,01:05:53.616,If we could just see the collapsed star inside...
01:05:53.782,01:05:56.577,"...the singularity, yeah, we'd solve gravity."
01:05:56.953,01:06:00.289,-And we can't get anything from it? -Nothing escapes that horizon.
01:06:00.456,01:06:01.790,Not even light.
01:06:01.958,01:06:03.876,"-The answer's there, just no way to see it."
01:06:03.960,01:06:05.461,-There's Miller's planet.
01:06:08.131,01:06:09.465,"Goodbye, Ranger."
01:06:22.270,01:06:24.563,CASE: This is fast for atmospheric entry.
01:06:24.730,01:06:26.983,-Should we use the thrusters to slow? -No.
01:06:27.441,01:06:30.778,I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics to save some fuel.
01:06:30.944,01:06:32.155,CASE: Air brake?
01:06:32.321,01:06:35.824,"-We want to get down fast, don't we? -We want to get there in one piece."
01:06:35.992,01:06:38.995,"-Hang on. CASE: Brand, Doyle, get ready."
01:06:54.843,01:06:57.346,CASE: We should ease! COOPER: Hands where I can see them.
01:06:57.513,01:07:00.849,The only time I went down was when a machine was easing at the wrong time.
01:07:01.017,01:07:03.852,"-A little caution-- -Can get you killed, like reckless driving."
01:07:04.020,01:07:06.189,"-Cooper, it's too damn fast! -I got this."
01:07:11.027,01:07:15.031,CASE: Should I disable the feedback? -No. I need to feel the air.
01:07:19.035,01:07:20.203,Here we go.
01:07:23.539,01:07:24.832,It's just water!
01:07:26.334,01:07:27.835,The stuff of life.
01:07:28.294,01:07:29.712,CASE: Twelve hundred meters.

01:07:32.048,01:07:34.717,-Can you maneuver? -I'll need to shave some speed.
01:07:34.883,01:07:37.511,I'm gonna spiral down on top of it. Everybody hang on!
01:07:39.888,01:07:40.973,CASE: Seven hundred.

01:08:15.424,01:08:16.509,No.
01:08:17.093,01:08:19.220,But very efficient.
01:08:21.680,01:08:23.891,What are you waiting for? Let's go!
01:08:24.057,01:08:25.934,"Go, go, go!"

01:08:55.756,01:08:56.965,CASE: This way.
01:08:59.802,01:09:01.595,About 200 meters.
01:09:11.104,01:09:12.731,The gravity's punishing.

01:09:51.354,01:09:52.521,Where's the rest?
01:09:53.021,01:09:54.523,Towards the mountains!
01:09:58.361,01:10:00.196,Those aren't mountains.
01:10:01.864,01:10:03.199,They're waves.
01:10:08.537,01:10:11.207,"Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
01:10:11.707,01:10:13.709,COOPER: That one's moving away from us.
01:10:20.216,01:10:21.884,AMELIA: We need the recorder.
01:10:32.060,01:10:34.355,"Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!"
01:10:34.522,01:10:37.900,We're not leaving without her data.
01:10:38.066,01:10:39.402,Get back here now!
01:10:39.568,01:10:41.237,We do not have time!
01:10:41.404,01:10:43.906,The second wave is coming! We're in the middle of a swell.

01:11:38.377,01:11:39.878,"Go, go! Go!"
01:11:45.426,01:11:46.469,Shit.
01:11:46.969,01:11:48.804,Manually overriding inside hatch!
01:11:52.308,01:11:53.476,Cooper! Wait!
01:12:00.816,01:12:04.487,COOPER: The engines are flooded! I'm gonna have to shut her down.
01:12:37.978,01:12:39.312,Holy shit.
01:12:43.692,01:12:45.027,Hang on!
01:13:16.308,01:13:17.560,"CASE, what's the problem?"
01:13:17.726,01:13:20.145,Too waterlogged. Let it drain.
01:13:21.229,01:13:22.481,Goddamn it!
01:13:22.648,01:13:27.319,-I told you to leave me! Why didn't you? -And I told you to get your ass back here!
01:13:27.486,01:13:32.157,-One of us was thinking about the mission! -You were thinking about getting home.
01:13:33.992,01:13:36.328,I was trying to do the right thing!
01:13:36.495,01:13:38.414,Can you tell that to Doyle?
01:13:40.749,01:13:42.918,"COOPER: CASE, how much time? -Forty-five to an hour."
01:13:44.712,01:13:46.046,"The stuff of life, huh?"
01:13:46.922,01:13:49.091,"What's this gonna cost us, Brand?"
01:13:49.257,01:13:51.259,A lot. Decades.
01:13:58.434,01:13:59.768,What happened to Miller?
01:14:00.561,01:14:03.271,"Judging by the wreckage, she was..."
01:14:03.439,01:14:06.108,...broken up by a wave soon after impact.
01:14:06.274,01:14:09.111,"How's the wreckage stayed together after all these years, huh?"
01:14:10.362,01:14:12.364,Because of the time slippage.
01:14:13.449,01:14:17.953,"On this planet's time, she just landed hours ago."
01:14:18.912,01:14:21.289,She probably just died minutes ago.
01:14:21.457,01:14:25.461,CASE: The data Doyle received was just the initial status echoing endlessly.
01:14:25.878,01:14:28.046,"Oh, we are not prepared for this."
01:14:30.423,01:14:33.886,You eggheads have the survival skills of a Boy Scout troop.
01:14:34.052,01:14:37.305,"Well, we got this far on our brains. Farther than any human in history."
01:14:37.473,01:14:39.057,"Well, not far enough!"
01:14:39.391,01:14:42.895,And now we're stuck here till there won't be anyone left on Earth to save.
01:14:45.939,01:14:48.609,"I'm counting every minute, same as you, Cooper."
01:14:53.405,01:14:55.240,Is there any possibility...
01:14:55.407,01:14:58.994,...some kind of a way we can maybe all jump in a black hole?
01:14:59.161,01:15:00.829,Gain back the years?
01:15:01.497,01:15:02.998,Don't shake your head at me.
01:15:03.165,01:15:05.167,"Time is relative, okay?"
01:15:05.333,01:15:08.420,"It can stretch and it can squeeze, but..."
01:15:08.921,01:15:11.131,...it can't run backwards. It just can't.
01:15:11.298,01:15:15.678,"The only thing that can move across dimensions, like time, is gravity."
01:15:18.430,01:15:19.598,Okay.
01:15:21.517,01:15:25.437,"The beings that led us here, they communicate..."
01:15:25.604,01:15:27.439,"-...through gravity, right? -Yes."
01:15:27.606,01:15:29.775,Could they be talking to us from the future?
01:15:30.693,01:15:32.945,-Maybe. -Okay. If they can....
01:15:34.154,01:15:37.365,They are beings of five dimensions.
01:15:37.825,01:15:41.161,"To them, time might be another physical dimension."
01:15:41.494,01:15:42.830,To them...
01:15:43.205,01:15:47.375,...the past might be a canyon that they can climb into and the future...
01:15:47.543,01:15:50.546,"...a mountain they can climb up. But to us, it's not, okay?"
01:15:51.672,01:15:54.049,"Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry."
01:15:56.218,01:15:58.011,But you knew about relativity.
01:15:58.178,01:15:59.512,Oh.
01:16:07.229,01:16:09.189,...my daughter was 10 years old.
01:16:09.815,01:16:12.568,I couldn't teach her Einstein's theories before I left.
01:16:13.026,01:16:15.863,Couldn't you have told her you were going to save the world?
01:16:16.404,01:16:17.489,No.
01:16:19.157,01:16:23.328,"When you become a parent, one thing becomes really clear."
01:16:24.830,01:16:28.000,And that is that you want to make sure your children feel safe.
01:16:29.042,01:16:32.755,And it rules out telling a 10-year-old that the world is ending.
01:16:35.257,01:16:36.592,Cooper?
01:16:40.345,01:16:42.848,"-How long for the engines, CASE? -A minute or two."
01:16:43.015,01:16:45.100,We don't have it. Helmets on!
01:16:49.021,01:16:50.773,"Brand, co-pilot, you're up."
01:16:50.939,01:16:53.441,"CASE, blow the cabin oxygen through the main thrusters!"
01:16:53.609,01:16:55.360,-We're gonna spark it. -Roger that.
01:16:55.611,01:16:56.945,-Locked. -Depressurizing.
01:17:02.868,01:17:04.119,Engines up!
01:17:32.981,01:17:34.482,"Hello, Rom."
01:17:34.942,01:17:36.609,I've waited years.
01:17:37.653,01:17:39.487,How--? How many years?
01:17:41.323,01:17:44.326,ROMILLY: By now it must be.... CASE: Twenty-three years...
01:17:44.492,01:17:46.161,"...four months, eight days."
01:17:50.623,01:17:51.792,Doyle?
01:17:58.006,01:18:01.009,I thought I was prepared. I knew the theory.
01:18:02.344,01:18:03.846,Reality's different.
01:18:04.930,01:18:06.098,And Miller?
01:18:07.683,01:18:09.685,There's nothing here for us.
01:18:12.437,01:18:13.939,Why didn't you sleep?
01:18:14.857,01:18:17.234,"Oh, I had a couple of stretches."
01:18:17.525,01:18:18.986,But I stopped believing you were coming back.
01:18:19.486,01:18:22.489,And something seemed wrong about dreaming my life away.
01:18:23.323,01:18:26.159,I learned what I could from the black hole...
01:18:26.534,01:18:28.996,...but I couldn't send anything to your father.
01:18:29.162,01:18:31.373,"We've been receiving, but nothing gets out."

01:18:55.814,01:18:58.233,Checking in. Saying hi.
01:18:59.317,01:19:00.819,Um....
01:19:00.986,01:19:02.738,Finished second in school.
01:19:04.364,01:19:06.742,Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.
01:19:07.075,01:19:09.912,"Pulled me down, but second's not bad."
01:19:11.079,01:19:13.248,Grandpa attended the ceremony.
01:19:14.875,01:19:16.877,Um-- Oh.
01:19:17.836,01:19:19.755,"I met another girl, Dad."
01:19:19.922,01:19:21.548,"I, uh...."
01:19:22.257,01:19:24.259,I really think this is the one.
01:19:25.593,01:19:28.180,Name's Lois. That's her right there.
01:19:31.224,01:19:33.226,Murphy stole Grandpa's car.
01:19:33.894,01:19:36.563,"She crashed it. She's okay, though."
01:19:37.230,01:19:38.273,"Hey, Dad."
01:19:39.232,01:19:40.567,Look at this!
01:19:41.401,01:19:42.903,You're a grandpa.
01:19:44.279,01:19:45.948,His name's Jesse.
01:19:46.614,01:19:51.244,"I kind of wanted to call him Coop, but Lois says, uh, maybe next time."
01:19:51.912,01:19:56.291,"Donald says he's already earned the great part, so we just leave it at that."
01:19:59.461,01:20:01.296,"LOIS: Oh, dear. Oh, dear."
01:20:02.089,01:20:03.715,"Say Bye-bye, Grandpa."
01:20:04.091,01:20:05.926,"Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay."
01:20:06.301,01:20:08.804,Sorry it's been a while.
01:20:10.222,01:20:11.264,Just...
01:20:13.475,01:20:15.477,...what with Jesse and all.
01:20:18.814,01:20:20.315,Uh....
01:20:21.984,01:20:24.319,Grandpa died last week.
01:20:24.736,01:20:27.823,We buried him out in the back forty next to Mom and...
01:20:28.656,01:20:29.782,...Jesse.
01:20:30.658,01:20:33.745,Which is where we would have buried you if you'd ever...
01:20:34.496,01:20:35.998,...come back.
01:20:37.499,01:20:39.751,Murph was there at the funeral.
01:20:40.335,01:20:43.130,"We don't see her that much, but she came for that."
01:20:46.341,01:20:48.760,"You aren't listening to this, I know that."
01:20:51.847,01:20:54.641,"All these messages are just, like..."
01:20:55.808,01:20:59.479,...drifting out there in the darkness.
01:21:00.522,01:21:02.858,"Lois says that, uh..."
01:21:03.691,01:21:06.444,...I have to let you go.
01:21:06.819,01:21:08.655,"And, uh..."
01:21:09.156,01:21:10.198,...so...
01:21:13.493,01:21:16.538,...I guess I'm letting you go.
01:21:17.539,01:21:20.208,"I don't know where you are, Dad..."
01:21:20.833,01:21:23.461,...but I hope that you're at peace.
01:21:25.213,01:21:26.339,Goodbye.
01:21:39.895,01:21:41.188,"Hey, Dad."
01:21:44.024,01:21:45.192,"Hey, Murph."
01:21:45.358,01:21:47.235,You son of a bitch.
01:21:50.989,01:21:53.491,I never made one of these when you were still responding...
01:21:53.658,01:21:55.994,...because I was so mad at you for leaving.
01:21:59.039,01:22:01.083,"And then when you went quiet, it..."
01:22:03.751,01:22:06.588,...seemed like I should live with that decision. And I have.
01:22:11.093,01:22:13.511,But today's my birthday.
01:22:17.182,01:22:20.352,"And it's a special one, because you told me...."
01:22:24.439,01:22:28.776,"You once told me that when you came back, we might be the same age."
01:22:30.528,01:22:33.615,And today I'm the age you were when you left.
01:22:36.618,01:22:38.703,So it would be a real good time for you to come back.
01:22:53.135,01:22:57.472,I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that I've never seen you in here before.
01:22:58.098,01:23:00.267,I've never been in here before.
01:23:02.144,01:23:05.147,BRAND: I talk to Amelia all the time.
01:23:05.647,01:23:06.982,It helps.
01:23:07.649,01:23:13.071,-I'm glad you've started. MURPH: I haven't. I-- I just had something I needed to get out.
01:23:13.405,01:23:15.823,-I know they're still out there. -I know.
01:23:15.991,01:23:20.162,There are so many reasons their communications might not be getting through.
01:23:20.328,01:23:21.788,"I know, professor."
01:23:22.414,01:23:25.333,I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.
01:23:26.501,01:23:28.836,Them never coming back or...
01:23:30.005,01:23:33.258,...coming back to find we've failed.
01:23:33.425,01:23:34.842,Then let's succeed.
01:23:35.843,01:23:36.928,So...
01:23:37.637,01:23:41.641,...back to the fourth iteration. Let's run it through some new fields.
01:23:41.974,01:23:45.145,"With respect, professor, we've tried that hundreds of times."
01:23:45.478,01:23:49.149,"It only has to work once, Murph."
01:23:52.444,01:23:56.323,BRAND: Every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet.
01:23:56.489,01:23:58.491,We've done well for the world here...
01:23:58.658,01:24:03.371,...whether or not we crack the equation before I kick the bucket.
01:24:03.538,01:24:06.458,"-Don't be morbid, professor. -I'm not afraid of death."
01:24:07.209,01:24:09.044,I'm an old physicist.
01:24:10.295,01:24:11.963,I'm afraid of time.
01:24:19.137,01:24:20.305,MURPH: Time.
01:24:22.349,01:24:24.016,You're afraid of time.
01:24:26.561,01:24:28.563,We've been trying to solve the equation...
01:24:28.730,01:24:31.233,...without changing the underlying assumption about time.
01:24:31.399,01:24:33.151,-And? -And that means...
01:24:33.318,01:24:37.739,...each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof.
01:24:37.905,01:24:40.075,It's recursive. It's nonsensical.
01:24:40.367,01:24:42.244,Are you calling my life's work...
01:24:42.410,01:24:44.162,"...nonsense, Murph?"
01:24:44.329,01:24:46.373,"No, I'm saying that you've been trying to..."
01:24:46.539,01:24:50.335,"...finish it with one arm-- No, with both arms. --tied behind your back."
01:24:52.420,01:24:54.422,And I don't understand why.
01:24:55.382,01:24:57.217,"I'm an old man, Murph."
01:24:58.093,01:25:00.762,Can we take this point up at another time?
01:25:00.928,01:25:03.055,I want to talk to my daughter.
01:25:07.852,01:25:11.606,...we must confront the reality of interstellar travel.
01:25:12.565,01:25:17.112,We must reach far beyond our own lifespans.
01:25:17.279,01:25:22.409,We must think not as individuals but as a species.
01:25:25.245,01:25:32.627,Do not go gentle into that good night COOPER: TARS kept the Endurance right where we needed her.
01:25:32.794,01:25:35.588,But the trip took years longer than we anticipated.
01:25:35.922,01:25:39.426,"We no longer have the fuel to visit both prospects, so..."
01:25:39.759,01:25:41.261,...we have to choose.
01:25:42.470,01:25:43.596,But how?
01:25:44.639,01:25:46.308,They're both promising.
01:25:47.809,01:25:52.314,"Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann is the one still transmitting, so...."
01:25:52.480,01:25:55.442,We've no reason to suspect Edmunds's data would have soured.
01:25:56.318,01:25:58.820,His world has key elements to sustain human life.
01:25:58.986,01:26:02.157,"-As does Dr. Mann's. -Cooper, this is my field."
01:26:03.325,01:26:04.409,And...
01:26:05.160,01:26:07.329,...I really believe Edmunds' is the better prospect.
01:26:07.495,01:26:10.832,"-Why? -Gargantua, that's why."
01:26:11.999,01:26:16.003,"Look at Miller's planet. Hydrocarbons, organics, yes..."
01:26:16.171,01:26:20.633,...but no life. Sterile. We'll find the same thing on Mann's.
01:26:21.008,01:26:22.677,Because of the black hole?
01:26:23.010,01:26:26.013,Murphy's Law. Whatever can happen will happen.
01:26:26.181,01:26:28.516,Accident is the first building block of evolution.
01:26:28.683,01:26:31.519,But when you're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen.
01:26:31.686,01:26:36.023,"It sucks in asteroids and comets, other events which would otherwise reach you."
01:26:36.358,01:26:38.193,We need to go further afield.
01:26:38.860,01:26:41.196,You once said that Dr. Mann...
01:26:42.447,01:26:43.948,...was the best of us.
01:26:44.199,01:26:47.369,He's remarkable. We're only here because of him.
01:26:47.952,01:26:49.787,And yet-- Yet here he is.
01:26:49.954,01:26:54.876,"He's on the ground, and he's sending a very unambiguous message, telling us..."
01:26:55.042,01:26:56.794,...to come to his planet.
01:26:56.961,01:27:01.549,"Granted, but Edmunds' data is more promising."
01:27:02.049,01:27:03.050,We should vote.
01:27:03.218,01:27:05.387,"Well, if we vote, there's something you should know."
01:27:06.554,01:27:07.555,Brand?
01:27:07.722,01:27:09.391,He has a right to know.
01:27:09.891,01:27:11.684,That has nothing to do with it.
01:27:11.851,01:27:14.896,-What does? -She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.
01:27:15.062,01:27:17.565,ROMILLY: Is that true? -Yes.
01:27:20.735,01:27:23.488,And that makes me want to follow my heart.
01:27:26.908,01:27:30.578,But maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory.
01:27:30.745,01:27:32.204,"You're a scientist, Brand."
01:27:32.372,01:27:33.915,So listen to me...
01:27:34.749,01:27:39.421,...when I say that love isn't something we invented. It's...
01:27:40.422,01:27:42.757,"...observable, powerful."
01:27:44.884,01:27:46.594,It has to mean something.
01:27:46.761,01:27:48.012,"Love has meaning, yes."
01:27:48.095,01:27:51.098,"Social utility, social bonding, child rearing...."
01:27:51.266,01:27:54.769,We love people who have died. Where's the social utility in that?
01:27:55.353,01:27:56.396,None.
01:27:56.563,01:28:00.442,"Maybe it means something more, something we can't..."
01:28:00.608,01:28:02.610,...yet understand.
01:28:02.777,01:28:06.281,"Maybe it's some evidence, some..."
01:28:07.239,01:28:11.703,...artifact of a higher dimension that we can't consciously perceive.
01:28:11.869,01:28:16.624,I'm drawn across the universe to someone I haven't seen in a decade...
01:28:16.791,01:28:19.627,...who I know is probably dead.
01:28:19.961,01:28:23.298,Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving...
01:28:23.465,01:28:26.301,...that transcends dimensions of time and space.
01:28:28.135,01:28:32.474,"Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it yet."
01:28:37.479,01:28:39.146,"All right, Cooper..."
01:28:41.065,01:28:42.317,...yes...
01:28:43.485,01:28:46.821,...the tiniest possibility of seeing Wolf again excites me.
01:28:47.655,01:28:49.324,That doesn't mean I'm wrong.
01:28:50.074,01:28:52.243,"Honestly, Amelia..."
01:28:53.995,01:28:55.162,...it might.
01:29:02.003,01:29:04.672,"TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's."
01:29:21.606,01:29:23.024,TOM: We'll lose about a third again.
01:29:23.190,01:29:24.776,But next year....
01:29:27.028,01:29:29.864,Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm and we'll make it up.
01:29:30.698,01:29:32.534,What happened to Nelson?
01:29:38.498,01:29:40.708,"LOIS: Murph, would you like some more soufflé?"
01:29:40.875,01:29:44.211,"Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious."
01:29:45.129,01:29:47.131,"Coop, finish your fritter, please."
01:29:49.300,01:29:50.885,Will you spend the night?
01:29:50.968,01:29:53.095,Your room is exactly as you left it. It's ready.
01:29:53.179,01:29:54.556,I need to get back.
01:29:54.722,01:29:58.726,"LOIS: My sewing machine is in there, but there's plenty-- I need to...."
01:30:01.563,01:30:03.147,Too many memories.
01:30:03.731,01:30:06.568,"We might have something for that. Hey, Coop."
01:30:14.075,01:30:15.409,The dust.
01:30:17.912,01:30:20.247,"Lois, I have a friend who..."
01:30:20.414,01:30:22.249,...could look at his lungs.
01:30:40.434,01:30:43.104,"COOPER: Amelia, I'm sorry. -You were just being objective."
01:30:43.270,01:30:46.774,Unless you're punishing me for screwing up on Miller's planet.
01:30:46.941,01:30:49.193,"No, this wasn't a personal decision."
01:30:50.027,01:30:54.073,"If you're wrong, you will have a very personal decision to make."
01:30:54.240,01:30:57.201,Your fuel calculations are based on a return journey.
01:30:57.535,01:31:01.413,"Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have to decide whether to return home..."
01:31:01.706,01:31:03.791,...or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.
01:31:04.125,01:31:07.795,Starting a colony could save us from extinction.
01:31:08.129,01:31:11.298,You might have to decide between seeing your children again...
01:31:11.465,01:31:13.300,...and the future of the human race.
01:31:14.802,01:31:16.554,I trust you'll be as objective then.
01:31:23.435,01:31:25.312,He's been asking for you since he came to.
01:31:25.479,01:31:27.148,We were trying to reach you.
01:31:33.112,01:31:34.155,Murph.
01:31:35.156,01:31:36.658,"I'm here, professor."
01:31:37.324,01:31:39.661,I let you all down.
01:31:39.994,01:31:43.330,"No, you got us so far. Real close."
01:31:45.166,01:31:47.001,I'll finish what you started.
01:31:47.168,01:31:49.336,"Good, good Murph."
01:31:51.673,01:31:53.966,You had faith...
01:31:55.176,01:31:56.468,...all those...
01:31:57.428,01:31:59.180,...all those years.
01:32:00.848,01:32:02.141,I...
01:32:02.308,01:32:04.811,I asked you to have faith.
01:32:06.520,01:32:09.356,I wanted you to believe...
01:32:10.858,01:32:12.694,...that your father...
01:32:15.697,01:32:17.531,...would come back.
01:32:17.699,01:32:19.033,"I do, professor."
01:32:20.660,01:32:22.161,"Forgive me, Murph."
01:32:22.870,01:32:24.872,There's nothing to forgive.
01:32:27.541,01:32:28.626,I....
01:32:29.210,01:32:31.045,"I lied, Murph."
01:32:33.380,01:32:35.216,I lied to you.
01:32:41.555,01:32:44.726,There was no need for him to....
01:32:45.977,01:32:47.854,To come back.
01:32:50.397,01:32:53.735,There is no way to help us.
01:32:55.069,01:32:56.070,But Plan A....
01:32:56.654,01:32:59.741,All this. All these people.
01:33:00.908,01:33:02.702,And the equation.
01:33:06.706,01:33:08.415,Did my father know?
01:33:12.253,01:33:13.921,Did he leave me?
01:33:17.925,01:33:18.926,Do...
01:33:20.094,01:33:21.428,...not...
01:33:22.429,01:33:23.681,...go...
01:33:24.891,01:33:26.433,...gentle....
01:33:28.435,01:33:29.603,No.
01:33:31.272,01:33:32.398,No!
01:33:33.607,01:33:35.276,You can't leave.
01:33:35.609,01:33:36.903,You-- No.
01:33:37.945,01:33:42.616,"MURPH: Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that your father died today. He had no pain."
01:33:43.242,01:33:44.911,He was at peace.
01:33:45.577,01:33:47.621,I'm very sorry for your loss.
01:34:00.259,01:34:01.928,"Brand, did you know?"
01:34:04.305,01:34:05.973,"He told you, right?"
01:34:08.893,01:34:10.269,You knew.
01:34:12.146,01:34:13.981,This was all a sham.
01:34:18.319,01:34:20.446,You left us here.
01:34:22.156,01:34:23.657,To suffocate.
01:34:25.827,01:34:27.161,To starve.
01:34:54.521,01:34:55.857,COOPER: Frozen cloud.
01:37:21.835,01:37:23.295,It's okay.
01:37:30.136,01:37:31.637,It's okay.
01:37:37.018,01:37:39.020,Pray you never learn...

01:44:26.593,01:44:29.262,-It's worthless? -It's half the answer.
01:44:30.221,01:44:33.224,"Okay, how do you find the other half?"
01:44:33.767,01:44:35.436,Out there? A black hole.

01:44:39.773,01:44:41.442,I'm not sure you can.

01:44:58.959,01:45:00.085,Damn it.
01:45:02.963,01:45:06.800,"Murph, don't--? Don't people have a right to know?"

01:45:11.638,01:45:14.975,But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand was manipulating us to do?
01:45:15.141,01:45:18.437,Brand gave up on us. I'm still trying to solve this.
01:45:19.062,01:45:20.146,So...
01:45:21.565,01:45:23.233,...do you have an idea?
01:45:23.942,01:45:25.276,A feeling.
01:45:28.655,01:45:30.657,I told you about my ghost.
01:45:32.659,01:45:34.745,My dad thought I called it a ghost...
01:45:35.161,01:45:36.830,...because I was scared of it.
01:45:40.333,01:45:41.668,But I was never scared of it.
01:45:43.837,01:45:46.507,I called it a ghost because it felt....
01:45:48.967,01:45:50.636,It felt like a person.
01:45:53.179,01:45:54.848,It was trying to tell me something.
01:45:57.809,01:46:00.812,"If there's an answer here on Earth, it's back there..."
01:46:01.271,01:46:03.189,"...somehow, in that room."
01:46:03.690,01:46:05.484,So I have to find it.
01:46:08.862,01:46:10.656,We're running out of time.
01:46:12.533,01:46:14.535,CASE: What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?
01:46:14.701,01:46:16.870,"COOPER: No, they can stay. I'll be sleeping anyway."
01:46:17.037,01:46:18.664,"-Hey, Coop? -Yeah?"
01:46:18.830,01:46:20.832,I have a suggestion for your return journey.
01:46:20.999,01:46:23.710,"-Yeah, what's that? -Have one last crack at the black hole."
01:46:25.629,01:46:27.213,"I'm going home, Rom."
01:46:27.380,01:46:30.634,"Yeah, I know. This isn't going to cost you any time."
01:46:31.384,01:46:33.219,There's a chance for the people on Earth.
01:46:33.970,01:46:37.015,-Talk to me. -Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.
01:46:37.182,01:46:41.061,-It's what we call a gentle singularity. -Gentle?
01:46:41.227,01:46:44.690,They're hardly gentle. But the tidal gravity is so quick that...
01:46:44.856,01:46:49.069,"...something crossing the horizon fast might survive. A probe, say."
01:46:49.235,01:46:53.907,-What happens after it crosses? -After the horizon is a complete mystery.
01:46:54.074,01:46:57.202,"So, what's to say there isn't some way that the probe..."
01:46:57.368,01:47:00.246,...can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data?
01:47:00.413,01:47:03.709,If he's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse.
01:47:03.875,01:47:06.670,"TARS: Just when did this probe become a he, professor?"
01:47:07.212,01:47:08.922,TARS is the obvious candidate.
01:47:09.756,01:47:11.717,I've already told him what to look for.
01:47:11.883,01:47:14.595,"I'd need the old optical transmitter off KIPP, Cooper."
01:47:14.761,01:47:16.096,You'd do this for us?
01:47:16.262,01:47:20.183,"Before you get all teary, remember that as a robot I have to do anything you say."
01:47:21.101,01:47:22.561,Your cue light's broken.
01:47:22.728,01:47:24.270,I'm not joking.
01:47:26.898,01:47:30.110,I'll need TARS to remove and adapt some components from KIPP.
01:47:30.276,01:47:32.613,I don't want to disturb his archival functions.
01:47:32.779,01:47:34.280,I'll supervise.
01:47:34.615,01:47:35.699,All right.
01:47:35.866,01:47:38.494,"Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites."
01:47:38.577,01:47:40.621,"One for Brand's lab, two for habitat."

01:47:46.042,01:47:48.754,...these conditions will hold. I think we should wait.
01:47:48.920,01:47:51.757,COOPER: CASE is headed down with the rest of the distillery equipment.
01:47:51.923,01:47:54.760,I'd really like to secure those sites by nightfall.
01:47:56.637,01:47:59.765,"Well, these squalls do usually blow over."
01:48:00.140,01:48:01.307,"Okay, then."

01:48:07.814,01:48:09.983,"TARS, 72 hours, yeah?"
01:48:10.150,01:48:11.317,"Roger that, Cooper."
01:48:17.658,01:48:20.661,MANN: Brand told me why you feel you have to go back.
01:48:22.495,01:48:25.290,But I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention...
01:48:25.624,01:48:29.795,...that a mission such as ours could certainly use an extra engineer.
01:48:31.630,01:48:35.842,"You better slow down, turbo. Safety first, CASE, remember."

01:48:57.656,01:49:01.159,You have attachments. But even without a family...
01:49:01.534,01:49:06.039,...I can promise you that that yearning to be with other people is powerful.
01:49:06.707,01:49:10.043,That emotion is at the foundation...
01:49:10.711,01:49:13.714,...of what makes us human. It's not to be taken lightly.
01:49:21.722,01:49:24.349,-How long have you had that cough? -A while.
01:49:34.901,01:49:36.820,COOP: Mom lets me play in here.
01:49:38.739,01:49:39.990,I don't touch your stuff.
01:50:10.937,01:50:12.605,Just take this gently.
01:50:17.736,01:50:21.114,"You know why we couldn't just send machines on these missions, don't you?"
01:50:21.740,01:50:26.369,A machine doesn't improvise well because you can't program a fear of death.
01:50:27.245,01:50:29.580,Our survival instinct is our single greatest...
01:50:29.748,01:50:33.293,"...source of inspiration. Take you, for example."
01:50:33.960,01:50:35.295,A father...
01:50:35.796,01:50:38.799,...with a survival instinct that extends to your kids.
01:50:39.966,01:50:44.637,What does research tell us is the last thing you're going to see before you die?
01:50:46.389,01:50:48.809,Your children. Their faces.
01:50:49.142,01:50:51.770,"At the moment of death, your mind's gonna push..."
01:50:51.937,01:50:53.646,...a little bit harder to survive.
01:50:54.314,01:50:55.398,For them.
01:50:56.274,01:50:57.483,Deep breath.
01:50:59.820,01:51:03.573,"Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop. Why don't you have a seat here for me?"
01:51:03.824,01:51:06.159,It's bad. They cannot stay here.
01:51:06.910,01:51:08.161,-Okay? -Yeah.

02:14:27.892,02:14:31.730,He's a robot. So you don't have to ask him to do anything.
02:14:31.896,02:14:33.190,"AMELIA: Cooper, you asshole!"

02:17:24.736,02:17:27.196,You told me we had enough resources for both of us.

02:26:55.348,02:26:57.433,...in their fifth dimension.
02:26:57.600,02:26:59.936,They saved us.
02:27:00.103,02:27:05.316,Yeah? Who the hell is they? And just why would they want to help us?
02:27:05.483,02:27:08.152,"I don't know, but they constructed this three-dimensional space..."
02:27:08.319,02:27:11.655,...inside their five-dimensional reality to allow you to understand it.
02:27:11.823,02:27:13.782,"Yeah, that ain't working."
02:27:13.950,02:27:15.493,"Yes, it is."
02:27:15.659,02:27:19.497,You've seen that time is represented here as a physical dimension.
02:27:19.663,02:27:22.500,You have worked out that you can exert a force across space-time.
02:27:23.167,02:27:26.337,Gravity to send a message.
02:27:26.712,02:27:28.047,Affirmative.
02:27:30.674,02:27:31.800,Gravity...
02:27:32.886,02:27:36.222,"...can cross the dimensions, including time."
02:27:36.555,02:27:37.849,Apparently.
02:27:41.727,02:27:43.729,Do you have the quantum data?
02:27:44.188,02:27:45.814,Roger. I have it.
02:27:46.732,02:27:50.736,"I am transmitting it on all wavelengths, but nothing is getting out, Cooper."
02:27:50.904,02:27:53.197,I can do this. I can do this.
02:27:53.656,02:27:56.367,But such complicated data to a child?
02:27:56.534,02:27:57.701,Not just any child.
02:27:59.745,02:28:01.915,"Oh, come on, Dad."
02:28:04.083,02:28:06.252,"Murph, the fire's out! Come on!"
02:28:06.419,02:28:10.423,"TARS: Even if you communicate it here, she won't understand its significance for years."
02:28:11.215,02:28:12.716,"I get that, TARS."
02:28:12.884,02:28:17.555,But we've got to figure something out or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!
02:28:17.721,02:28:19.265,Cooper...
02:28:19.432,02:28:21.935,...they didn't bring us here to change the past.
02:28:25.563,02:28:27.065,Say that again.
02:28:27.231,02:28:30.693,They didn't bring us here to change the past.
02:28:35.073,02:28:37.075,"No, they didn't bring us here at all."
02:28:41.704,02:28:43.372,We brought ourselves.
02:28:52.590,02:28:56.635,"TARS, give me the coordinates for NASA in binary."
02:28:57.220,02:28:59.638,In binary. Roger. Feeding data.
02:29:23.955,02:29:25.914,It's not a ghost.
02:29:27.625,02:29:29.127,It's gravity.
02:29:29.460,02:29:31.129,"COOPER: Don't you get it yet, TARS?"
02:29:31.795,02:29:33.631,I brought myself here!
02:29:34.465,02:29:37.969,We're here to communicate with the three-dimensional world.
02:29:38.427,02:29:39.928,We're the bridge!
02:29:47.936,02:29:49.688,I thought they chose me.
02:29:53.026,02:29:54.902,"-But they didn't choose me, they chose her."
02:29:54.986,02:29:56.695,"TARS: For what, Cooper?"
02:29:59.198,02:30:00.866,To save the world.
02:30:05.163,02:30:09.542,All of this is one little girl's bedroom. Every moment.
02:30:09.875,02:30:11.335,It's infinitely complex.
02:30:11.502,02:30:16.215,"They have access to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything!"
02:30:16.382,02:30:21.054,They can't find a specific place in time. They can't communicate.
02:30:22.555,02:30:25.558,That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...
02:30:25.724,02:30:27.226,...just like I found this moment.
02:30:27.393,02:30:29.728,"-How, Cooper? -Love, TARS, love."
02:30:29.895,02:30:34.358,"It's just like Brand said. My connection with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!"
02:30:34.525,02:30:36.360,What are we here to do?
02:30:37.320,02:30:39.197,Find how to tell her.
02:30:41.990,02:30:43.326,The watch.
02:30:46.412,02:30:47.580,The watch.
02:30:48.997,02:30:50.083,That's it.
02:30:52.585,02:30:55.588,We code the data into the movement of the second hand.
02:30:59.217,02:31:02.428,"TARS, translate the data into Morse and feed it to me."
02:31:02.595,02:31:06.890,"Translating data to Morse. Cooper, what if she never came back for it?"
02:31:08.559,02:31:11.229,She will. She will.
02:31:12.438,02:31:14.065,"MAN: Murph, I can see his car!"
02:31:15.274,02:31:16.442,"He's coming, Murph!"
02:31:18.277,02:31:20.113,Okay. I'm coming down.
02:31:21.572,02:31:23.074,TARS: How do you know?
02:31:26.285,02:31:28.121,Because I gave it to her.
02:31:33.542,02:31:36.044,Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.
02:31:39.548,02:31:40.633,Dot-dot...
02:31:41.967,02:31:43.636,...dash-dot.
02:31:44.095,02:31:45.763,Dot-dash-dot-dot.
02:31:46.139,02:31:48.807,Dot-dash-dot-dot.
02:31:49.308,02:31:50.643,Dash-dash-dash.
02:31:50.976,02:31:53.271,"Dash, dash, dash."
02:32:11.497,02:32:12.831,He came back!
02:32:13.791,02:32:17.961,It was him all the time! I didn't know. It was him!
02:32:19.004,02:32:20.964,Dad's gonna save us.
02:33:03.716,02:33:05.008,Eureka!
02:33:08.721,02:33:10.055,It's traditional.
02:33:14.685,02:33:16.312,Eureka!
02:33:21.024,02:33:22.526,Did it work?
02:33:22.693,02:33:24.528,TARS: I think it might have.
02:33:25.863,02:33:27.198,How do you know?
02:33:27.365,02:33:30.701,Because the bulk beings are closing the tesseract.
02:33:34.538,02:33:36.540,"Don't you get it yet, TARS?"
02:33:37.708,02:33:39.543,They're not beings.
02:33:40.211,02:33:41.545,They're us.
02:33:43.589,02:33:46.717,"What I've been doing for Murph, they're doing for me."
02:33:47.260,02:33:48.761,For all of us.
02:33:48.927,02:33:51.222,"Cooper, people couldn't build this."
02:33:51.389,02:33:53.724,"No. No, not yet."
02:33:54.099,02:33:55.559,But one day.
02:33:56.227,02:33:59.438,Not you and me. But people.
02:34:00.105,02:34:04.192,A civilization that's evolved past the four dimensions we know.
02:34:10.741,02:34:12.243,COOPER: What happens now?
02:35:14.847,02:35:16.307,MAN: Mr. Cooper.
02:35:20.519,02:35:22.270,"All right. Let's take it slow, sir."
02:35:22.646,02:35:24.815,"Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper."
02:35:24.898,02:35:26.650,"Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore."
02:35:26.859,02:35:29.570,"Actually, you are 124 years old."
02:35:36.994,02:35:38.329,"Take it slow, sir."
02:35:39.287,02:35:41.540,"You were, uh, extremely lucky."
02:35:41.874,02:35:45.210,The Rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply.
02:35:59.392,02:36:00.726,Where am I?
02:36:02.395,02:36:03.979,Cooper Station.
02:36:05.356,02:36:06.899,Currently orbiting Saturn.
02:36:08.901,02:36:10.986,Cooper Station.
02:36:13.406,02:36:15.408,Nice of you to name it after me.
02:36:19.244,02:36:20.371,What?
02:36:20.538,02:36:23.707,"The station isn't named after you, sir. It's, uh, named after your daughter."
02:36:24.207,02:36:27.210,Although she's always maintained just how important you were.
02:36:27.378,02:36:29.087,Is she still alive?
02:36:31.048,02:36:32.925,She'll be here in a couple weeks.
02:36:34.009,02:36:36.429,She is far too old to be transferring from another station...
02:36:36.595,02:36:39.014,...but when she heard that you'd been found...
02:36:40.223,02:36:42.893,"...well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper we're talking about."
02:36:43.769,02:36:45.270,"Yes, it is."
02:36:47.398,02:36:49.900,We'll have you checked out of here in a couple days.
02:36:52.570,02:36:55.072,I'm sure you'll be excited to see what's in store.
02:36:56.364,02:37:00.285,"I actually, uh, did a paper on you in high school."
02:37:00.619,02:37:02.955,I know all about your life back on Earth.
02:37:04.623,02:37:05.791,"Oh, yeah."
02:37:05.958,02:37:07.250,Right.
02:37:09.628,02:37:14.967,"If-- If you'll follow me, we've got a really good situation for you."
02:37:18.303,02:37:22.390,"So, uh, when I made my suggestion to Miss Cooper..."
02:37:23.266,02:37:26.103,...I was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect.
02:37:32.943,02:37:35.821,"Of course, I didn't speak to her personally."
02:37:35.988,02:37:37.990,MAN 1: We always set the plate upside-down.
02:37:38.156,02:37:40.951,"Glasses or cups, whatever it was, upside-down."
02:37:41.118,02:37:45.998,"Well, my dad was a farmer. Uh, like everybody else back then."
02:37:46.164,02:37:48.626,There just wasn't enough food.
02:37:48.792,02:37:51.504,"WOMAN 2: We wore little things, little strips..."
02:37:51.670,02:37:56.842,...of sheet over our nose and mouth so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.
02:37:57.009,02:38:00.471,"Well, it was pretty exciting for me because it was hope."
02:38:00.638,02:38:04.933,"MAN 2: I don't care who describes it, there is no way for it to be exaggerated. It was that bad."
02:38:05.017,02:38:08.687,MAN: She did confirm just how much you loved farming.
02:38:09.021,02:38:10.689,"-Oh, she did, did she? -Yeah."
02:38:10.856,02:38:12.107,Come here.
02:38:12.650,02:38:17.655,Home sweet home. Everything replaced and put back where it....
02:38:23.994,02:38:26.038,"-Hey, is this...? -Oh, yeah."
02:38:26.204,02:38:29.207,The machine we found out near Saturn when we found you. Yes.
02:38:29.374,02:38:32.044,"Its, uh, power source was shot, but we could get you another one."
02:38:32.210,02:38:34.379,Yes. Please.
02:38:35.631,02:38:36.965,TARS: Settings.
02:38:37.382,02:38:38.884,General settings.
02:38:39.384,02:38:41.219,Security settings.
02:38:43.972,02:38:49.019,"Honesty, new setting: 95 percent."
02:38:49.352,02:38:51.855,Confirmed. Additional customization?
02:38:52.731,02:38:56.860,Humor: 75 percent.
02:38:57.235,02:38:58.571,Confirmed.
02:38:59.237,02:39:02.365,"Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...."
02:39:02.533,02:39:04.492,Let's make that 60 percent.
02:39:06.745,02:39:08.872,Sixty percent confirmed.
02:39:09.540,02:39:12.585,-Knock-knock. -You want 55?
02:39:17.505,02:39:19.592,Is this really what it was like?
02:39:21.844,02:39:24.221,"It was never this clean, Slick. Heh."
02:39:28.726,02:39:32.395,I don't care much for this pretending we're back where we started.
02:39:34.522,02:39:36.775,I want to know where we are.
02:39:38.401,02:39:39.945,Where we're going.
02:39:44.532,02:39:47.578,-Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there. -Yeah.
02:39:47.745,02:39:48.871,Family?
02:39:49.037,02:39:50.413,"Yeah, they all came out to see her."
02:39:50.497,02:39:52.916,She's been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.
02:40:25.949,02:40:27.826,You told them I like farming.
02:40:33.791,02:40:35.458,"It was me, Murph."
02:40:37.961,02:40:39.755,I was your ghost.
02:40:41.006,02:40:42.633,I know.
02:40:44.467,02:40:49.139,People didn't believe me. They thought that I was doing it all myself.
02:40:49.306,02:40:50.348,But...
02:40:53.268,02:40:55.187,...I knew who it was.
02:41:00.150,02:41:02.319,Nobody believed me.
02:41:02.820,02:41:05.280,But I knew you'd come back.
02:41:07.825,02:41:09.034,How?
02:41:11.036,02:41:14.164,Because my dad promised me.
02:41:20.212,02:41:22.214,"Well, I'm here now, Murph."
02:41:23.506,02:41:24.842,I'm here.
02:41:26.343,02:41:27.678,No.
02:41:29.722,02:41:33.851,No parent should have to watch their own child die.
02:41:36.812,02:41:39.481,I have my kids here for me now.
02:41:41.734,02:41:43.235,You go.
02:41:46.697,02:41:48.198,Where?
02:41:51.702,02:41:53.245,Brand.
02:42:03.088,02:42:04.715,MURPH: She's out there...
02:42:11.179,02:42:12.890,...setting up camp.
02:42:39.416,02:42:41.084,Alone...
02:42:42.252,02:42:44.922,...in a strange galaxy.
02:42:55.808,02:43:00.478,Maybe right now she's settling in for the long nap...
02:43:18.831,02:43:21.666,...by the light of our new sun...
02:43:37.140,02:43:39.184,...in our new home.
