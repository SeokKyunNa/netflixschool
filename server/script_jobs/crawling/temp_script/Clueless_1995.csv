00:00:50.968,00:00:55.180,"SO, O.K, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING, IS THIS, LIKE, A NOXZEMA COMMERCIAL OR WHAT?"
00:00:55.222,00:01:00.060,"BUT SERIOUSLY, I ACTUALLY HAVE A WAY NORMAL LIFE FOR A TEEN-AGE GIRL."
00:01:00.101,00:01:02.396,"I MEAN, I GET UP, I BRUSH MY TEETH."
00:01:02.437,00:01:05.065,AND I PICK OUT MY SCHOOL CLOTHES.
00:01:23.208,00:01:25.084,DADDY'S A LITIGATOR.
00:01:25.126,00:01:27.588,THOSE ARE THE SCARIEST KINDS OF LAWYERS.
00:01:27.629,00:01:30.591,"EVEN LUCY, OUR MAID, IS TERRIFIED OF HIM."
00:01:30.632,00:01:34.302,"AND DADDY IS SO GOOD, HE GETS $500 AN HOUR TO FIGHT WITH PEOPLE."
00:01:34.344,00:01:36.095,HE FIGHTS WITH ME FOR FREE.

00:01:37.639,00:01:39.474,"CHER, PLEASE DON'T START WITH THE JUICE AGAIN."
00:01:39.516,00:01:40.809,"DADDY, YOU NEED YOUR VITAMIN C."
00:01:40.851,00:01:42.603,WHERE'S MY BRIEFCASE?

00:01:58.243,00:02:00.537,YOU WERE HARDLY MARRIED TO HIS MOTHER.
00:02:00.579,00:02:02.706,WHY DO I HAVE TO SEE JOSH?
00:02:02.748,00:02:05.084,"YOU DIVORCE WIVES, NOT CHILDREN."
00:02:05.125,00:02:07.795,HERE.
00:02:07.836,00:02:10.547,DID I SHOW YOU THE LOQUED OUT JEEP DADDY GOT ME?
00:02:10.589,00:02:14.551,"IT'S GOT FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE, DUAL SIDE AIRBAGS, AND A MONSTER SOUND SYSTEM."
00:02:14.593,00:02:18.263,"I DON'T HAVE A LICENSE YET, BUT I NEED SOMETHING TO LEARN ON."
00:02:20.057,00:02:23.351,BOY! THAT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE!
00:02:23.393,00:02:25.062,HERE'S WHERE DIONNE LIVES.
00:02:25.104,00:02:31.401,SHE'S MY FRIEND BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE JEALOUS OF US.
00:02:31.443,00:02:35.614,I MUST GIVE HER SNAPS FOR HER COURAGEOUS FASHION EFFORTS.
00:02:35.656,00:02:37.574,"HEY, CHER."
00:02:37.616,00:02:43.330,DIONNE AND I WERE BOTH NAMED AFTER GREAT SINGERS OF THE PAST WHO NOW DO INFOMERCIALS.
00:02:43.371,00:02:45.124,SO?
00:02:45.165,00:02:46.541,BEEN SHOPPING WITH DR. SEUSS?
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.794,I WOULDN'T SKIN A COLLIE FOR A BACKPACK.
00:02:48.836,00:02:50.629,IT'S FAUX.
00:02:50.671,00:02:52.673,HELLO!
00:02:52.714,00:02:54.257,I TOTALLY PAUSED.

00:02:59.513,00:03:02.432,"IT'S NOT EVEN 8:30, AND MURRAY IS PAGING ME."
00:03:02.474,00:03:04.059,HE IS SO POSSESSIVE.
00:03:04.101,00:03:07.562,"THIS WEEKEND HE CALLED ME, AND HE'S ALL, WHERE WERE YOU TODAY?"
00:03:07.604,00:03:11.566,DIONNE AND HER BOYFRIEND MURRAY ARE IN THIS DRAMATIC RELATIONSHIP.
00:03:11.608,00:03:15.070,I THINK THEY'VE SEEN THAT IKE AND TINA TURNER MOVIE JUST TOO MANY TIMES.
00:03:15.112,00:03:17.531,"NOW, I HAVE TO SAY TO HER..."
00:03:17.572,00:03:20.701,WHY DO YOU PUT UP WITH IT? YOU COULD DO BETTER.
00:03:20.742,00:03:21.910,I KNOW. SHH.
00:03:25.164,00:03:27.332,"WOMAN, WHY DON'T YOU BE ANSWERING ANY OF MY PAGES?"
00:03:27.374,00:03:28.500,I HATE WHEN YOU CALL ME WOMAN.
00:03:28.542,00:03:30.085,WHERE YOU BEEN ALL WEEKEND?
00:03:30.127,00:03:31.712,YOU JEEPIN' BEHIND MY BACK?
00:03:31.753,00:03:33.088,JEEPIN'.
00:03:33.130,00:03:40.595,"NO! BUT SPEAKING OF VEHICULAR SEX, PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN HOW THIS KMART HAIR EXTENSION GOT INTO THE BACK SEAT OF YOUR CAR."
00:03:40.637,00:03:43.473,I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
00:03:43.515,00:03:46.101,THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF YOUR STRINGY SOMETHING OR ANOTHERS.
00:03:46.143,00:03:48.103,"I DO NOT WEAR POLYESTER HAIR, O.K.?"
00:03:48.145,00:03:50.313,UNLIKE SHAWANNA.
00:03:50.355,00:03:51.356,"DEE, I'M AUDI."
00:03:51.398,00:03:52.607,BYE.

00:03:56.862,00:04:01.033,I DON'T KNOW WHY DIONNE'S GOING OUT WITH A HIGH SCHOOL BOY.
00:04:01.075,00:04:02.534,THEY'RE LIKE DOGS.
00:04:02.576,00:04:04.536,YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THEM AND FEED THEM.
00:04:04.578,00:04:08.040,THEY'RE JUST LIKE THESE NERVOUS CREATURES THAT JUMP AND SLOBBER ALL OVER YOU.
00:04:08.082,00:04:10.042,EW! GET OFF OF ME!
00:04:11.085,00:04:12.920,"OH, AS IF!"
00:04:12.961,00:04:17.549,SHOULD ALL OPPRESSED PEOPLE BE ALLOWED REFUGE IN AMERICA?
00:04:17.591,00:04:20.052,AMBER WILL TAKE THE CON POSITION.
00:04:20.094,00:04:22.054,CHER WILL BE PRO.
00:04:22.096,00:04:24.056,"CHER, TWO MINUTES."
00:04:24.098,00:04:26.558,SO. O.K.
00:04:26.600,00:04:31.438,"LIKE, RIGHT NOW, FOR EXAMPLE, THE HAITI-ANS NEED TO COME TO AMERICA."
00:04:31.479,00:04:35.067,"SOME PEOPLE ARE ALL, WHAT ABOUT THE STRAIN ON OUR RESOURCES?"
00:04:35.109,00:04:38.779,"LIKE, WHEN I HAD THIS GARDEN PARTY FOR MY FATHER'S BIRTHDAY, RIGHT?"
00:04:38.820,00:04:41.865,I SAID RSVP BECAUSE IT WAS A SIT-DOWN DINNER.
00:04:41.907,00:04:46.954,"BUT PEOPLE CAME THAT, LIKE, DID NOT RSVP, SO I WAS, LIKE, TOTALLY BUGGIN'."
00:04:46.995,00:04:52.209,"I HAD TO HAUL ASS TO THE KITCHEN, REDISTRIBUTE THE FOOD, SQUISH IN EXTRA PLACE SETTINGS."
00:04:52.251,00:04:56.004,"BY THE END OF THE DAY, IT WAS, LIKE, THE MORE THE MERRIER."
00:04:56.046,00:05:03.511,"SO IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD JUST GET TO THE KITCHEN, REARRANGE SOME THINGS, WE COULD CERTAINLY PARTY WITH THE HAITI-ANS."
00:05:03.553,00:05:09.517,MAY I REMIND YOU THAT IT DOES NOT SAY RSVP ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY?
00:05:09.559,00:05:11.478,WHOO! YEAH!
00:05:11.519,00:05:13.021,THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
00:05:19.569,00:05:21.196,"AMBER, REPLY?"
00:05:21.238,00:05:23.531,"MR. HALL, HOW CAN I ANSWER THAT?"
00:05:23.573,00:05:27.327,"THE TOPIC IS HAITI, AND SHE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME LITTLE PARTY."
00:05:27.368,00:05:30.789,HELLO!
00:05:30.831,00:05:32.582,WHATEVER.
00:05:32.624,00:05:35.627,"IF SHE DOESN'T DO THE ASSIGNMENT, I CAN'T DO MINE."
00:05:35.669,00:05:37.545,LADIES.
00:05:37.587,00:05:41.549,"SO, DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY FURTHER THOUGHTS ON CHER'S ORATION?"
00:05:41.591,00:05:43.051,"ELTON, COMMENTS?"
00:05:43.093,00:05:45.053,"YEAH, I CAN'T FIND MY CRANBERRIES CD."
00:05:45.095,00:05:47.055,I GOT TO GO TO THE QUAD BEFORE SOMEBODY SNAGS IT.
00:05:47.097,00:05:49.057,I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PERMIT THAT.
00:05:49.099,00:05:50.517,ANY FURTHER INSIGHTS?
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.144,"I HAVE AN INSIGHT, MR. HALL."
00:05:52.186,00:05:53.770,I'M ALL EARS.
00:05:53.812,00:06:03.280,"O.K., LIKE, THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT THE ROLLING STONES IS THE WAY MY KIDS ARE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT NINE INCH NAILS, SO I REALLY SHOULDN'T TORMENT MY MOM ANYMORE, HUH?"
00:06:03.322,00:06:10.287,"YES, WELL, IT'S A LITTLE OFF THE SUBJECT OF HAITI, BUT TOLERANCE IS ALWAYS A GOOD LESSON."
00:06:10.329,00:06:14.041,EVEN WHEN IT COMES OUT OF NOWHERE.
00:06:14.082,00:06:18.545,"AND WITH THAT IN MIND, I'M GOING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR REPORT CARDS."
00:06:18.586,00:06:21.548,"NOW, IS THERE A CHRISTIAN STOVITZ IN THIS CLASS?"
00:06:21.589,00:06:25.052,"MR. HALL, THE BUZZ ON CHRISTIAN IS THAT HIS PARENTS HAVE JOINT CUSTODY."
00:06:25.093,00:06:28.555,HE'LL BE SPENDING ONE SEMESTER IN CHICAGO AND ONE SEMESTER HERE.
00:06:28.596,00:06:32.267,I THINK IT IS A TRAVESTY OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION.
00:06:32.309,00:06:34.186,"THANK YOU FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE, CHER."
00:06:39.607,00:06:44.112,COULD ALL CONVERSATIONS PLEASE COME TO A HALT?
00:06:47.448,00:06:51.953,AND COULD THE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS PLEASE BE POSTPONED TILL THE NEXT PERIOD?
00:06:54.622,00:06:57.500,"SUDDENLY, A DARK CLOUD SETTLED OVER FIRST PERIOD."
00:06:57.542,00:07:00.337,I GOT A C IN DEBATE?
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.006,DEE?
00:07:03.048,00:07:05.008,DID YOU GET YOUR REPORT CARD?
00:07:05.050,00:07:06.634,YEAH. I'M TOAST.
00:07:06.676,00:07:08.053,I TOTALLY CHOKED.
00:07:08.095,00:07:10.013,MY FATHER'S GOING TO GO BALLISTIC ON ME.
00:07:10.055,00:07:12.015,MR. HALL WAS WAY HARSH.
00:07:12.057,00:07:14.517,HE GAVE ME A C-MINUS.
00:07:14.559,00:07:18.021,"HE GAVE ME A C, WHICH DRAGS DOWN MY ENTIRE AVERAGE."
00:07:18.063,00:07:19.522,BYE.
00:07:19.564,00:07:20.982,I'LL CALL YOU.
00:07:21.024,00:07:22.609,ISN'T MY HOUSE CLASSIC?
00:07:22.650,00:07:26.446,THE COLUMNS DATE ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1972.
00:07:26.487,00:07:28.531,WASN'T MY MOM A BETTY?
00:07:28.573,00:07:31.534,SHE DIED WHEN I WAS JUST A BABY.
00:07:31.576,00:07:33.787,A FLUKE ACCIDENT DURING A ROUTINE LIPOSUCTION.
00:07:33.828,00:07:39.042,"I DON'T REMEMBER HER, BUT I LIKE TO PRETEND SHE STILL WATCHES OVER ME."
00:07:39.084,00:07:41.795,"HEY, MOM. 98 IN GEOMETRY."
00:07:43.630,00:07:49.052,YUCK! THE MAUDLIN MUSIC OF THE UNIVERSITY STATION?
00:07:49.094,00:07:50.429,WAH WAH WAH!
00:07:52.597,00:07:56.017,YUCK! WHAT IS IT ABOUT COLLEGE AND CRYBABY MUSIC?
00:07:56.059,00:07:57.518,HEY.
00:07:57.560,00:07:59.520,WHO'S WATCHING THE GALLERIA?
00:07:59.562,00:08:03.524,THE FLANNEL SHIRT-- IS THAT A NOD TO THE CRISPY SEATTLE WEATHER?
00:08:03.566,00:08:06.527,OR ARE YOU TRYING TO STAY WARM IN FRONT OF THE REFRIGERATOR?
00:08:06.569,00:08:09.030,"OH, WOW, YOU'RE FILLING OUT THERE."
00:08:09.072,00:08:12.033,"OH, WOW, YOUR FACE IS CATCHING UP WITH YOUR MOUTH."
00:08:12.075,00:08:14.035,I WENT BY DAD'S OFFICE.
00:08:14.077,00:08:16.537,HE IS NOT YOUR DAD.
00:08:16.579,00:08:20.041,JUST BECAUSE MY MOTHER MARRIES SOMEONE ELSE DOESN'T MEAN HE'S MY FATHER.
00:08:20.083,00:08:21.751,THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS.
00:08:21.793,00:08:24.045,I HOPE YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF STAYING HERE.
00:08:24.087,00:08:25.546,I SURE WANT TO.
00:08:25.588,00:08:27.548,I GOT A PLACE NEAR SCHOOL.
00:08:27.590,00:08:29.968,SHOULDN'T YOU GO TO SCHOOL ON THE EAST COAST?
00:08:30.010,00:08:33.054,I HEAR GIRLS AT NYU AREN'T AT ALL PARTICULAR.
00:08:33.096,00:08:34.931,YOU'RE FUNNY.
00:08:37.100,00:08:39.019,HEY!
00:08:39.060,00:08:42.063,"YOU JUST GOT HERE, AND ALREADY YOU'RE PLAYING COUCH COMMANDO."
00:08:42.105,00:08:48.820,"IN SOME PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE, IT'S CONSIDERED COOL TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE WORLD."
00:08:48.862,00:08:52.573,I SO NEED LESSONS FROM YOU ON HOW TO BE COOL.
00:08:52.615,00:08:54.951,TELL ME THAT PART ABOUT KENNY G. AGAIN.
00:08:54.993,00:08:59.164,"COME ON, YOU CHUCKLEHEADS!"
00:09:00.540,00:09:02.501,"JOSH, ARE YOU STILL GROWING?"
00:09:02.542,00:09:04.503,YOU LOOK TALLER THAN YOU DID AT EASTER.
00:09:04.544,00:09:06.004,I DON'T THINK SO.
00:09:06.046,00:09:08.507,HIS HEAD LOOKS BIGGER.
00:09:08.548,00:09:13.011,"SO, JOSH, HAVE YOU GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT CORPORATE LAW?"
00:09:13.053,00:09:15.514,I THINK I'D LIKE TO CHECK OUT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW.
00:09:15.555,00:09:18.725,"WHAT FOR? YOU WANT TO HAVE A MISERABLE, FRUSTRATING LIFE?"
00:09:18.766,00:09:21.311,JOSH WILL HAVE THAT NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES.
00:09:21.353,00:09:23.313,HE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
00:09:23.355,00:09:24.939,HE'S IN A GOOD COLLEGE.
00:09:24.981,00:09:27.067,I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU HAVE SOME DIRECTION.
00:09:27.108,00:09:29.194,I HAVE DIRECTION.
00:09:29.236,00:09:30.404,YEAH. TOWARDS THE MALL.
00:09:30.445,00:09:32.030,WHERE'S YOUR REPORT CARD?
00:09:32.072,00:09:33.698,IT'S NOT READY YET.
00:09:33.740,00:09:35.283,WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT READY YET?
00:09:35.325,00:09:38.036,"SOME TEACHERS WERE TRYING TO LOWBALL ME, DADDY."
00:09:38.078,00:09:40.539,YOU SAY NEVER ACCEPT A FIRST OFFER.
00:09:40.580,00:09:44.292,THESE GRADES ARE A JUMPING-OFF POINT TO START NEGOTIATIONS.
00:09:44.334,00:09:45.544,VERY GOOD.
00:09:47.087,00:09:49.047,DEE?
00:09:49.089,00:09:50.549,"YEAH, JAKE."
00:09:50.590,00:09:52.551,NO! NOT THE AFTERNOON!
00:09:52.592,00:09:54.344,YOU ARE SUCH A BROWN-NOSER.
00:09:54.386,00:09:56.555,YOU ARE SUCH A SUPERFICIAL SPACE CADET.
00:09:56.596,00:09:59.057,WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOUR TEACHERS WILL CHANGE YOUR GRADES?
00:09:59.099,00:10:02.436,ONLY THE FACT THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY OTHER SEMESTER.
00:10:04.438,00:10:09.067,I TOLD MY P.E. TEACHER AN EVIL MALE HAD BROKEN MY HEART.
00:10:09.109,00:10:11.570,SO SHE RAISED MY C TO A B.
00:10:11.611,00:10:13.572,THEY'RE HORRIBLE!
00:10:13.613,00:10:16.657,AND THEY'RE ALL LIKE THIS.
00:10:16.699,00:10:24.207,THEN I PROMISED MISS GEIST I'D START A LETTER-WRITING CAMPAIGN TO MY CONGRESSMAN ABOUT VIOLATIONS OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT.
00:10:24.249,00:10:28.086,BUT MR. HALL WAS TOTALLY RIGID.
00:10:28.128,00:10:32.090,"HE SAID MY DEBATES WERE UNRESEARCHED, UNSTRUCTURED, AND UNCONVINCING."
00:10:32.132,00:10:34.050,AS IF!
00:10:36.136,00:10:40.599,"I FELT IMPOTENT AND OUT OF CONTROL, WHICH I REALLY HATE."
00:10:40.640,00:10:46.605,I NEEDED TO FIND SANCTUARY IN A PLACE WHERE I COULD GATHER MY THOUGHTS AND REGAIN MY STRENGTH.
00:10:52.444,00:10:53.987,WHAT'S WRONG?
00:10:54.028,00:10:56.197,ARE YOU SUFFERING FROM BUYER'S REMORSE OR SOMETHING?
00:10:56.239,00:10:57.949,NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.
00:10:57.991,00:11:02.537,"WE'VE BEEN SHOPPING ALL DAY, AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT MR. HALL."
00:11:02.579,00:11:08.042,"I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING TO CONVINCE HIM OF MY SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE, BUT I WAS BRUTALLY REBUFFED."
00:11:08.084,00:11:12.547,"HE'S A MISERABLE LITTLE MAN WHO WANTS TO MAKE EVERYONE ELSE MISERABLE, TOO."
00:11:12.589,00:11:14.048,"DEE, THAT'S IT!"
00:11:14.090,00:11:18.219,WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE MR. HALL SUBLIMELY HAPPY.
00:11:18.261,00:11:26.561,"HERE'S THE 411 ON MR. HALL-- HE'S SINGLE, HE'S 47, AND HE EARNS MINOR DUCATS AT A THANKLESS JOB."
00:11:26.603,00:11:29.981,"WHAT THAT MAN NEEDS IS A GOOD, HEALTHY BOINK FEST."
00:11:30.023,00:11:34.068,"UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS A MAJOR BABE DROUGHT IN MY SCHOOL."
00:11:34.110,00:11:38.406,THE EVIL TROLLS FROM THE MATH DEPARTMENT WERE ACTUALLY MARRIED.
00:11:38.448,00:11:40.074,"OOH, SNICKERS."
00:11:40.116,00:11:46.080,"AND IN THE GRAND TRADITION OF P.E. TEACHERS, MS. STOEGER SEEMED TO BE SAME-SEX ORIENTED."
00:11:46.122,00:11:50.084,"OF COURSE, THERE WAS ALWAYS MISS GEIST."
00:11:50.126,00:11:53.505,SOMETHING TOLD ME NOT TO DISCOUNT MISS GEIST.
00:11:56.257,00:12:04.057,"WELL, SURE, SHE HAS RUNS IN HER STOCKINGS, AND HER SLIP IS ALWAYS SHOWING, AND SHE HAS MORE LIPSTICK ON HER TEETH THAN ON HER MOUTH."
00:12:04.098,00:12:07.060,POPULAR UPRISINGS FROM ESTATES TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY!
00:12:07.101,00:12:10.063,"GOD, THIS WOMAN IS SCREAMING FOR A MAKEOVER."
00:12:10.104,00:12:11.439,I'M HER ONLY HOPE.
00:12:13.692,00:12:20.073,"ROUGH WINDS DO SHAKE THE DARLING BUDS OF MAY, BUT THY ETERNAL SUMMER SHALL NOT FADE."
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.575,DID YOU WRITE THAT?
00:12:21.616,00:12:23.577,DUH!

00:13:26.681,00:13:28.057,THIS IS SO UNEXPECTED.
00:13:28.099,00:13:30.059,I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A SPEECH PREPARED.
00:13:30.101,00:13:32.562,"UH, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS."
00:13:32.604,00:13:35.565,TARDINESS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO ALL ON YOUR OWN.
00:13:35.607,00:13:38.025,"MANY, MANY PEOPLE CONTRIBUTED TO MY TARDINESS."
00:13:38.067,00:13:53.207,"THANKS TO MY PARENTS FOR NEVER GIVING ME A RIDE TO SCHOOL, THE L.A. CITY BUS DRIVER FOR TAKING A CHANCE ON AN UNKNOWN KID, THE WONDERFUL CREW AT McDONALD'S FOR SPENDING HOURS MAKING THOSE EGG McMUFFINS, WITHOUT WHICH I MIGHT NEVER BE TARDY."
00:13:57.587,00:14:03.551,"IF MR. BIRKENSTOCK HAS NO POLITICAL MESSAGES TO INCLUDE IN HIS SPEECH, I'LL GO ON."
00:14:03.593,00:14:04.803,CHER HOROWITZ--TWO TARDIES.
00:14:04.843,00:14:06.304,I OBJECT!
00:14:06.346,00:14:08.640,DO YOU RECALL THE DATES OF THESE ALLEGED TARDIES?
00:14:08.682,00:14:10.600,ONE WAS LAST MONDAY.
00:14:10.642,00:14:13.561,"MR. HALL, I WAS SURFING THE CRIMSON WAVE."
00:14:13.603,00:14:15.772,I HAD TO HAUL ASS TO THE LADIES.
00:14:15.814,00:14:19.818,"I ASSUME YOU ARE REFERRING TO WOMEN'S TROUBLES, SO I'LL LET THAT ONE SLIDE."
00:14:19.859,00:14:21.569,"THANK YOU, MR. HALL."
00:14:21.611,00:14:24.030,MISS GEIST WAS RIGHT ABOUT YOU.
00:14:24.071,00:14:26.574,WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
00:14:26.616,00:14:32.455,"WELL, SHE SAID THAT YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS SCHOOL WITH ANY INTELLIGENCE."

00:14:43.174,00:14:46.636,A SECOND NOTICE FOR THREE OUTSTANDING TICKETS.
00:14:46.678,00:14:49.597,I DON'T REMEMBER GETTING A FIRST NOTICE.
00:14:49.639,00:14:51.474,THE TICKET IS THE FIRST NOTICE.
00:14:51.516,00:14:53.643,I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD GET TICKETS WITHOUT A LICENSE!
00:14:53.685,00:14:56.020,SURE YOU CAN.
00:14:56.062,00:14:58.022,"WELL, NOT AROUND HERE YOU CAN'T."
00:14:58.064,00:15:05.154,"FROM THIS MOMENT ON, YOU WILL NOT DRIVE, SIT, DO ANYTHING IN THAT JEEP WITHOUT A SUPERVISED DRIVER."
00:15:05.196,00:15:07.031,NO CRUISING AROUND WITH DIONNE.
00:15:07.073,00:15:08.949,TWO PERMITS DO NOT EQUAL A LICENSE.
00:15:08.991,00:15:11.035,DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?
00:15:11.077,00:15:12.662,"YES, DADDY."
00:15:12.704,00:15:15.331,"CHER, I EXPECT YOU TO BECOME A GOOD DRIVER."
00:15:15.373,00:15:18.292,I WILL. I'M GOING TO PRACTICE REAL HARD.
00:15:18.334,00:15:20.961,O.K.
00:15:21.003,00:15:24.048,A LICENSED DRIVER WITH NOTHING TO DO?
00:15:24.090,00:15:27.051,WHERE WOULD I FIND SUCH A LOSER?
00:15:27.093,00:15:29.554,"GRANOLA BREATH, YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR CHIN."
00:15:29.596,00:15:31.055,I'M GROWING A GOATEE.
00:15:31.097,00:15:35.560,YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE LAST ONE AT THE COFFEEHOUSE WITHOUT CHIN PUBES.
00:15:35.602,00:15:41.566,"I ENJOY THESE LITTLE CHATS OF OURS, BUT IN THE INTEREST OF SAVING TIME, JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT."
00:15:41.608,00:15:43.568,O.K.
00:15:43.610,00:15:50.950,"SO, ACTUALLY, I HAVE A PERMIT, BUT DADDY SAYS I CAN'T TAKE THE JEEP OUT WITHOUT A LICENSED DRIVER."
00:15:50.991,00:15:56.497,SINCE YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING-- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF YOU SHUTTING UP TILL YOU GET YOUR WAY?
00:15:56.539,00:15:57.998,SLIM TO NONE.
00:15:58.040,00:16:00.418,COME ON.
00:16:00.460,00:16:02.211,"HEY, JAMES BOND."
00:16:02.253,00:16:04.839,"IN AMERICA, WE DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD."
00:16:04.881,00:16:07.508,I AM.
00:16:07.550,00:16:09.510,I GOT TO GET BACK TO SCHOOL.
00:16:09.552,00:16:11.262,WANT TO PRACTICE PARKING?
00:16:11.304,00:16:14.181,WHAT'S THE POINT?
00:16:14.223,00:16:16.517,WHAT CLASS YOU GOING TO?
00:16:16.559,00:16:19.145,"ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO A TREE PEOPLE MEETING."
00:16:19.186,00:16:22.523,WE MIGHT GET MARKY MARK TO PLANT A CELEBRITY TREE.
00:16:22.565,00:16:24.024,HOW FABULOUS.
00:16:24.066,00:16:30.030,GETTING MARKY MARK TO TAKE TIME FROM HIS BUSY PANTS-DROPPING SCHEDULE TO PLANT TREES.
00:16:30.072,00:16:31.783,WHY DON'T YOU HIRE A GARDENER?
00:16:31.825,00:16:37.956,"MAYBE MARKY MARK WANTS TO USE HIS POPULARITY FOR A GOOD CAUSE, MAKE A CONTRIBUTION."
00:16:37.997,00:16:44.545,"IN CASE YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT, A CONTRIBUTION IS-- I HAVE DONATED MANY ITALIAN OUTFITS TO LUCY."
00:16:44.587,00:16:54.054,"AS SOON AS I GET MY LICENSE, I FULLY INTEND TO BRAKE FOR ANIMALS, AND I HAVE CONTRIBUTED MANY HOURS TO HELPING TWO LONELY TEACHERS FIND ROMANCE."
00:16:54.096,00:16:56.516,WHICH I'LL BET SERVES YOUR INTERESTS MORE THAN THEIRS.
00:16:56.557,00:17:01.020,"IF I EVER SAW YOU DO ANYTHING THAT WASN'T 90% SELFISH, I'D DIE OF SHOCK."
00:17:01.061,00:17:03.564,"OH, THAT WOULD BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME."
00:17:08.068,00:17:10.029,WOULD YOU CALL ME SELFISH?
00:17:10.070,00:17:12.031,NO. NOT TO YOUR FACE.
00:17:12.072,00:17:13.533,REALLY?
00:17:13.574,00:17:18.037,IS JOSH GIVING YOU SHIT BECAUSE HE'S IN HIS POSTADOLESCENT IDEALISTIC PHASE?
00:17:18.078,00:17:19.497,"LOOK, THERE'S MR. HALL."
00:17:19.539,00:17:21.541,MR. HALL! MR. HALL!
00:17:21.582,00:17:23.543,"UM, DO YOU DRINK COFFEE?"
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.545,NOT FROM THIS CAFETERIA.
00:17:25.586,00:17:28.047,"YES, UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES."
00:17:28.088,00:17:30.049,I AM SUCH A RETARD.
00:17:30.090,00:17:36.055,"WHEN I WAS PACKING DADDY'S LUNCH, I GAVE HIM MY LEMON SNAPPLE AND TOOK HIS SUCKY ITALIAN ROAST."
00:17:36.096,00:17:38.057,DO YOU WANT IT?
00:17:38.098,00:17:40.059,YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT IT?
00:17:40.100,00:17:41.853,TSCHA! IT MIGHT STUNT MY GROWTH.
00:17:41.895,00:17:43.563,I WANT TO BE 5'10 LIKE CINDY CRAWFORD.
00:17:43.604,00:17:46.065,BUT I THOUGHT YOU OR MISS GEIST MIGHT LIKE IT.
00:17:46.106,00:17:48.067,MAYBE YOU COULD SHARE IT.
00:17:48.108,00:17:49.569,WELL...THANKS.

00:18:13.634,00:18:16.512,"NOT A TOTAL BETTY, BUT A VAST IMPROVEMENT."
00:18:16.554,00:18:18.014,WE DID OUR BEST.
00:18:18.056,00:18:20.307,WE GOT TO BOOK TO P.E.

00:18:23.561,00:18:26.522,"I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT AT LEAST IT'S EXERCISE."
00:18:26.564,00:18:29.025,I FEEL LIKE SUCH A HEIFER.
00:18:29.067,00:18:36.032,"I HAD TWO BOWLS OF SPECIAL K, THREE PIECES OF TURKEY BACON, FIVE PEANUT BUTTER M&amp;M's, AND, LIKE, THREE PIECES OF LICORICE."
00:18:36.074,00:18:37.324,"OH, MY GOD. LOOK."

00:19:42.473,00:19:48.562,THE ENTIRE STUDENT BODY WAS UTTERLY GRATEFUL FOR THE IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR GRADES.
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.580,"CHER, WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?"
00:20:06.622,00:20:08.082,MY REPORT CARD?

00:20:29.145,00:20:31.981,I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER IF THEY WERE BASED ON REAL GRADES.
00:20:33.649,00:20:35.401,FABULOUS.
00:20:38.154,00:20:43.117,"I FELT SO SATISFIED, I WANTED TO DO MORE GOOD DEEDS."

00:21:08.101,00:21:12.063,"I MEAN, STANDING IN LINE FOR 40 MINUTES IS HARDLY AEROBICALLY EFFECTIVE."
00:21:12.105,00:21:15.816,I DOUBT I WORKED OFF THE CALORIES IN A STICK OF CAREFREE GUM.
00:21:15.858,00:21:18.069,WHOO! WHOO!

00:21:29.496,00:21:32.291,"DIONNE, YOU'RE UP."
00:21:32.332,00:21:38.839,I HAVE A NOTE FROM MY TENNIS INSTRUCTOR SAYING I SHOULDN'T EXPOSE MYSELF TO ANY TRAINING THAT MIGHT DERAIL HIS TEACHINGS.
00:21:38.881,00:21:40.591,FINE.

00:21:43.052,00:21:48.599,MY PLASTIC SURGEON DOESN'T WANT ME DOING ANY ACTIVITY WHERE BALLS FLY AT MY NOSE.

00:22:02.780,00:22:06.325,YOU COULD HIT A FEW BALLS IN THOSE CLOTHES.
00:22:06.366,00:22:10.496,SHE COULD BE A FARMER IN THOSE CLOTHES.
00:22:10.537,00:22:13.582,"DEE, MY MISSION IS CLEAR."

00:22:41.610,00:22:44.571,"WE DON'T HAVE ANY TEA, BUT WE HAVE COKE."

00:22:56.125,00:22:57.793,THEY DO THE TV STATION.
00:22:57.835,00:23:00.046,THEY THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON EARTH.
00:23:00.087,00:23:01.839,AND THAT'S THE PERSIAN MAFIA.
00:23:01.881,00:23:04.800,YOU CAN'T HANG WITH THEM UNLESS YOU OWN A BMW.

00:28:14.067,00:28:18.531,THAT YOU FOUND SOMEONE MORE CLUELESS THAN YOU ARE TO WORSHIP YOU.
00:28:18.572,00:28:20.533,I AM RESCUING HER FROM TEEN-AGE HELL.
00:28:20.574,00:28:24.036,THE WOUNDS OF ADOLESCENCE CAN TAKE YEARS TO HEAL.
00:28:24.077,00:28:25.538,YOU'VE NEVER HAD A MOTHER.

00:33:24.085,00:33:25.253,WHO WAS THAT?
00:33:26.588,00:33:30.843,"CHER, AIN'T THAT THE SAME DRESS THAT YOU WAS WEARING YESTERDAY?"
00:33:30.884,00:33:33.386,"SAY, AMBULAR."

00:33:38.391,00:33:40.059,AS IF!
00:33:40.101,00:33:42.061,LIKE I WOULD REALLY WEAR SOMETHING FROM JUDY'S.
00:33:42.103,00:33:45.106,DO YOU PREFER FASHION VICTIM OR ENSEMBLY CHALLENGED?
00:33:45.148,00:33:46.566,UH!
00:33:46.608,00:33:48.067,THAT CLONE.

00:33:56.535,00:33:59.538,EXCUSE ME.
00:33:59.579,00:34:01.540,UH!
00:34:01.581,00:34:03.542,THIS IS SO NOT FIXABLE.
00:34:03.583,00:34:07.546,IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO THE PARTY GODS.
00:34:07.587,00:34:09.047,"LOOK, I'LL MAKE AMENDS."
00:34:09.088,00:34:10.549,HOW ABOUT SOME CHRONIC SHIT?
00:34:10.590,00:34:12.551,IT'S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO.
00:34:12.592,00:34:14.469,LET'S SPARK IT.
00:34:17.096,00:34:19.016,"HEY, ELTON'S OVER THERE."
00:34:19.057,00:34:21.977,ACT LIKE TRAVIS IS SAYING SOMETHING FUNNY.

00:34:32.988,00:34:34.155,NOTHING.
00:34:38.117,00:34:39.578,"OH, HERE."
00:34:39.619,00:34:43.456,"HEY, EVERYONE."
00:34:53.132,00:34:55.343,"GOD, ELTON!"
00:34:55.385,00:34:57.846,AAH! NO!
00:34:57.888,00:34:59.431,IT'S DEE! COME ON!

00:35:02.559,00:35:05.604,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:35:05.645,00:35:08.023,WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO YOUR HEAD?
00:35:08.065,00:35:10.025,'CAUSE I'M KEEPING IT REAL.
00:35:10.067,00:35:12.569,LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE!
00:35:12.611,00:35:13.862,LOOK AT LAWRENCE'S HEAD.

00:35:15.238,00:35:16.573,YOU LOOK GOOD!
00:35:16.615,00:35:17.866,AS WILL YOU.
00:35:17.908,00:35:19.952,WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT HE THINKS?
00:35:19.993,00:35:21.369,I HAVE TO LOOK AT YOU.
00:35:21.411,00:35:24.414,WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU NOW?
00:35:24.456,00:35:26.041,RIGHT BEFORE THE YEARBOOK PICTURES?
00:35:26.083,00:35:27.626,WHAT WILL I TELL MY GRANDCHILDREN?
00:35:27.667,00:35:29.086,YOU KNOW WHAT?
00:35:29.127,00:35:31.046,O.K. THAT'S IT.
00:35:31.088,00:35:32.547,I'M CALLING YOUR MOTHER.
00:35:32.589,00:35:34.549,HOLD UP!
00:35:34.591,00:35:36.551,WAIT!
00:35:36.593,00:35:38.053,"YO, MAN!"
00:35:38.095,00:35:39.554,DON'T CALL MY MOM!
00:35:39.596,00:35:41.556,THE SAME THING HAPPENED AT THE SPRING DANCE.
00:35:41.598,00:35:44.059,SHE SPENT THE ENTIRE AFTERPARTY IN THE BATHROOM.
00:35:44.101,00:35:45.894,THAT ALMOST DESTROYED MY BUZZ.
00:35:45.936,00:35:47.353,I'M STILL BAKED.
00:35:55.278,00:35:58.657,WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO BUMP INTO PEOPLE?
00:35:58.698,00:36:01.534,YEAH. I'M COOL WITH THAT.
00:36:01.576,00:36:04.913,"HEY, TAI!"
00:36:07.582,00:36:09.042,ARE YOU O.K.?
00:36:09.084,00:36:12.045,YEAH. WHERE'S YOUR SENSE OF GOOD HOSPITALITY?
00:36:12.087,00:36:15.048,THAT WAS SO COOL THE WAY YOU DID THAT.
00:36:15.090,00:36:16.883,I WISH I COULD DO IT.
00:36:16.925,00:36:18.176,"OH, NO. DON'T."
00:36:18.217,00:36:19.594,WHY NOT?
00:36:19.636,00:36:22.514,"IF GIRLS DID IT, HOW WOULD GUYS IMPRESS THEM?"
00:36:22.555,00:36:24.557,"I DON'T KNOW, LIKE..."
00:36:24.599,00:36:26.184,STUFF.
00:36:26.225,00:36:28.770,WHAT KIND OF STUFF?
00:36:34.109,00:36:36.069,"TAI, I NEED YOU."
00:36:36.111,00:36:37.278,ELTON'S OVER THERE.
00:37:02.554,00:37:04.263,TAI!
00:37:04.305,00:37:05.682,TAI!
00:37:10.562,00:37:12.022,USE THIS.
00:37:12.064,00:37:13.523,YOU GUYS SHOULD USE ICE.
00:37:13.565,00:37:15.525,"TRAVIS, WE'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL!"
00:37:15.567,00:37:17.027,"TAI, ARE YOU O.K.?"
00:37:17.069,00:37:20.906,"TRAVIS, TAI WOULD HAVE WANTED YOU TO ENJOY THE PARTY."
00:37:23.116,00:37:25.035,"IF IT'S A CONCUSSION, KEEP HER CONSCIOUS."
00:37:25.077,00:37:26.452,ASK HER QUESTIONS.
00:37:26.494,00:37:27.871,WHAT'S 7 TIMES 7?
00:37:27.913,00:37:29.164,STUFF SHE KNOWS.
00:37:36.588,00:37:38.048,THAT'S SOME BUMP YOU GOT THERE.
00:37:38.090,00:37:39.549,YEAH.
00:37:39.591,00:37:41.551,YOU READY TO GO BACK OUT THERE?
00:37:41.593,00:37:43.053,"YEAH, I AM."
00:37:43.095,00:37:45.055,YOU SURE?
00:37:49.101,00:37:50.936,GOOD! LET'S DO IT.
00:37:53.105,00:37:57.984,I HAD TO GIVE MYSELF SNAPS FOR ALL THE GOOD DEEDS I WAS DOING.
00:37:58.026,00:38:00.486,IT WAS GREAT.
00:37:58.026,00:38:04.991,"LOVE WAS EVERYWHERE, AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS ALONE, I WAS REALLY HAPPY FOR TAI."
00:38:05.033,00:38:12.498,"IT'S LIKE THAT BOOK I READ IN NINTH GRADE THAT SAID, 'TIS A FAR, FAR BETTER THING DOING STUFF FOR OTHER PEOPLE."
00:38:14.417,00:38:15.501,HELLO?
00:38:15.543,00:38:17.503,DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?
00:38:17.545,00:38:20.006,"A WATCH DOESN'T REALLY GO WITH THIS OUTFIT, DADDY."
00:38:20.048,00:38:21.507,WHERE ARE YOU?
00:38:21.549,00:38:23.509,HAVING A SNACK WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.
00:38:23.551,00:38:25.011,"WHERE, IN KUWAIT?"
00:38:25.053,00:38:26.763,IS THAT IN THE VALLEY?
00:38:26.805,00:38:30.016,I EXPECT YOU TO WALK IN THIS DOOR IN 20 MINUTES.
00:38:30.058,00:38:33.019,"WELL, UM, IT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN THAT, DAD."
00:38:33.061,00:38:36.022,EVERYWHERE IN L.A.
00:38:38.900,00:38:40.860,SORRY TO MAKE YOU LEAVE.
00:38:40.902,00:38:44.530,DIONNE'S BUCKING FOR BEST DRAMATIC ACTRESS AT A VAL PARTY.
00:38:44.572,00:38:45.865,HA HA HA!
00:38:45.907,00:38:47.366,"HEY, SUMMER."
00:38:47.408,00:38:49.535,HI. PRETTY RANDOM FIESTA.
00:38:49.577,00:38:51.037,THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
00:38:51.079,00:38:52.538,"NO, I GOT HER."
00:38:52.580,00:38:54.040,I'M RIGHT BELOW WILSHIRE AND LINDEN.
00:38:54.082,00:38:56.501,THAT'S RIGHT NEAR ME.
00:38:56.542,00:38:58.503,GREAT. TAI WILL GO WITH SUMMER.
00:38:58.544,00:39:00.505,"CHER, YOU'LL COME WITH ME."
00:39:00.546,00:39:04.050,"ACTUALLY, IF YOU TAKE WILSHIRE TO CANON, THAT TURNS INTO BENEDICT."
00:39:04.092,00:39:09.055,"THEN SHE'D HAVE TO GO BACK SOUTH, AND I'M ALREADY GOING NORTH."
00:39:09.097,00:39:13.226,BUT YOU COULD TAKE TAI ON YOUR WAY UP TO SUNSET.
00:39:13.268,00:39:15.061,THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
00:39:15.103,00:39:17.480,I'D HAVE TO GET OFF THE FREEWAY.
00:39:17.522,00:39:19.024,I HATE THAT.
00:39:19.065,00:39:22.027,"TAI, GO WITH SUMMER."
00:39:22.068,00:39:23.444,WATCH YOUR FEET.
00:39:32.787,00:39:36.624,DIDN'T TAI LOOK CUTE TONIGHT?
00:39:44.590,00:39:49.054,"I REALLY LOVE HER HAIR WHEN IT'S ALL WILD, YOU KNOW?"
00:39:49.095,00:39:55.434,"IT'S ALSO VERY PRETTY WHEN IT'S ALL UP WITH THAT CURLY TENDRILS, LIKE IN THAT PICTURE I TOOK."
00:39:55.476,00:40:02.067,"YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS, AND I DO NOT HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE GIRLS."
00:40:02.108,00:40:05.653,"WELL, I'M GLAD, BECAUSE YOUR HAPPINESS MEANS A LOT TO ME."
00:40:05.695,00:40:07.239,IT DOES?
00:40:07.280,00:40:10.533,SURE. I SAW HOW HARD YOUR BREAKUP WITH FOLETTE WAS.
00:40:10.575,00:40:15.830,YEAH. I THINK WE BOTH KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE LONELY.
00:40:17.498,00:40:18.958,WHATEVER.
00:40:19.000,00:40:21.794,"THE THING IS, I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE YOU SETTLED."
00:40:26.132,00:40:27.967,WHERE ARE WE GOING?
00:40:30.636,00:40:31.971,I KNEW IT.
00:40:34.140,00:40:35.600,I KNEW IT.
00:40:35.641,00:40:37.102,YOU KNEW WHAT?
00:40:37.143,00:40:39.604,THAT YOU WERE TOTALLY SPRUNG ON ME.
00:40:39.645,00:40:41.273,HELLO?
00:40:41.314,00:40:42.523,TAI?
00:40:42.565,00:40:44.067,HER PICTURE'S IN YOUR LOCKER.
00:40:44.109,00:40:46.194,THE PICTURE YOU TOOK IS IN MY LOCKER.
00:40:46.236,00:40:50.698,"OH, I'M HAVING A TWIN PEAKS EXPERIENCE."
00:40:50.740,00:40:53.201,I KNEW IT WHEN YOU KISSED ME.
00:40:53.243,00:40:54.535,"SUCK AND BLOW IS A GAME, ELTON."
00:40:54.577,00:40:55.828,I KNOW IT'S A GAME.
00:40:55.870,00:40:57.038,STOP IT!
00:41:00.083,00:41:01.542,FINE.
00:41:01.584,00:41:03.544,"YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET YOU, CHER."

00:41:06.589,00:41:08.549,I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU WITH TAI!
00:41:08.591,00:41:10.051,TAI?
00:41:10.093,00:41:11.844,WHY WOULD I GO WITH TAI?
00:41:11.886,00:41:13.930,WHY NOT?
00:41:13.972,00:41:15.307,WHY NOT?
00:41:15.348,00:41:17.809,DON'T YOU EVEN KNOW WHO MY FATHER IS?
00:41:17.850,00:41:20.061,YOU ARE A SNOB AND A HALF.
00:41:21.604,00:41:23.064,"CHER, LISTEN TO ME."
00:41:23.106,00:41:25.066,ME AND TAI...

00:41:32.615,00:41:34.033,IT MAKES SENSE.
00:41:36.453,00:41:37.787,CUT IT OUT!
00:41:37.829,00:41:39.122,COME ON!

00:42:18.453,00:42:20.497,"O.K. THE BAG, TOO."

00:42:30.631,00:42:32.008,THIS IS AN ALAIA.
00:42:32.050,00:42:33.551,AN A-WHAT-A?
00:42:33.592,00:42:37.347,"IT'S, LIKE, A TOTALLY IMPORTANT DESIGNER."
00:42:37.389,00:42:39.474,I WILL TOTALLY SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD.

00:42:51.152,00:42:54.113,2...3...
00:42:54.155,00:43:00.537,"THE EVENING HAD TURNED INTO A ROYAL MESS-- SEXUALLY HARASSED, ROBBED."
00:43:00.578,00:43:07.544,"I DIDN'T KNOW THE NUMBER OF THE PARTY, SO I COULDN'T CALL DIONNE, AND DADDY WOULD KILL ME IF HE KNEW WHERE I WAS."
00:43:07.585,00:43:12.173,"THERE WAS JUST ONE PERSON LEFT TO CALL, AND I REALLY, REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO CALL HIM."
00:43:12.215,00:43:13.550,COME ON.
00:43:15.593,00:43:17.178,HELLO?
00:43:17.220,00:43:18.637,"JOSH, YOU BUSY?"
00:43:18.679,00:43:20.681,IT'S MEL'S DAUGHTER.
00:43:20.723,00:43:24.852,"I WAS AT THIS PARTY, AND MY DESIGNATED DRIVER TRIED TO ATTACK ME."
00:43:24.894,00:43:28.481,"I GOT OUT, BUT THEN HE DROVE OFF AND DESERTED ME."
00:43:28.523,00:43:36.364,"THEN THIS GUY WITH A GUN HELD ME UP, TOOK MY MONEY AND MY PHONE, YELLED AT ME, AND FORCED ME TO RUIN MY DRESS."
00:43:36.406,00:43:38.074,O.K. O.K.

00:43:42.661,00:43:46.624,"MAN, YOU OWE ME."
00:43:46.665,00:43:48.084,THE MAN IS RIDICULOUS.
00:43:48.126,00:43:51.588,"HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE UNIQUE THOUGHT IN HIS LITTLE, PUNY BRAIN."
00:43:51.629,00:43:55.091,I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME MERIT IN LEARNING FORM STRAIGHT OFF.
00:43:55.133,00:43:56.509,"OH, JOSH, PLEASE!"
00:43:56.551,00:44:03.057,HE'S TAKEN OUR MINDS AT THE MOST FECUND POINT AND RESTRAINED THEM BEFORE THEY'VE WANDERED THROUGH THE GARDEN OF IDEAS.
00:44:03.099,00:44:07.228,"IT'S JUST LIKE HAMLET SAID, TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE."
00:44:07.270,00:44:09.606,NO. HAMLET DIDN'T SAY THAT.
00:44:09.647,00:44:13.151,I THINK THAT I REMEMBER HAMLET ACCURATELY.
00:44:13.192,00:44:18.281,"WELL, I REMEMBER MEL GIBSON ACCURATELY, AND HE DIDN'T SAY THAT."
00:44:18.323,00:44:20.032,THAT POLONIUS GUY DID.
00:44:20.074,00:44:21.867,HA HA HA!
00:44:35.590,00:44:37.842,I'M GOING TO WALK HEATHER TO HER DOOR.
00:44:37.883,00:44:40.470,TRY AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.
00:44:54.108,00:44:58.904,EW! MY LIFE IS TURNING INTO A BIGGER DISASTER THAN MALIBU.
00:44:58.946,00:45:01.574,I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY TO TAI.
00:45:01.616,00:45:03.826,I FELT REALLY NERVOUS.
00:45:03.868,00:45:08.456,"EVEN FABIAN, MY MASSEUSE, SAID I HAD A LOT OF TENSION IN MY BACK."
00:45:08.498,00:45:12.084,"IT'S MY HIPS, ISN'T IT?"
00:45:12.126,00:45:14.795,"NO, OF COURSE NOT."
00:45:14.837,00:45:16.047,YOU COULD DO SO MUCH BETTER.
00:45:16.088,00:45:18.049,"HE THINKS HE'S ALL THAT, TAI."
00:45:18.090,00:45:19.551,YEAH. GOD'S GIFT.
00:45:19.592,00:45:21.052,YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR HIM.
00:45:21.093,00:45:25.557,"IF I'M TOO GOOD FOR HIM, THEN HOW COME I'M NOT WITH HIM?"
00:45:25.598,00:45:27.058,I HAVE GOT AN IDEA.
00:45:27.099,00:45:33.565,"LET'S BLOW OFF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH, GO TO THE MALL, HAVE A CALORIE FEST, AND SEE THE NEW CHRISTIAN SLATER."
00:45:33.606,00:45:35.066,YES!
00:45:35.107,00:45:37.443,"OH, YOU GUYS!"
00:45:42.323,00:45:44.576,LOOK AT HIM.
00:45:44.617,00:45:47.579,BREAK ME OFF A PIECE OF THAT.
00:45:47.620,00:45:49.247,HA HA HA!
00:45:49.288,00:45:50.747,SURVEY SAYS?
00:45:50.789,00:45:52.083,DOABLE.
00:45:52.124,00:45:54.669,PUNY.
00:45:54.711,00:45:56.671,"OH, I HATE MUSCLES."
00:45:56.713,00:45:59.006,I DON'T REALLY CARE EITHER WAY.
00:45:59.048,00:46:02.510,JUST AS LONG AS HIS YOU-KNOW-WHAT ISN'T CROOKED.
00:46:02.552,00:46:04.262,I REALLY HATE THAT.
00:46:04.303,00:46:05.471,WHAT?
00:46:05.513,00:46:06.972,SHH!
00:46:07.014,00:46:08.474,WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?
00:46:08.516,00:46:11.519,CHER IS SAVING HERSELF FOR LUKE PERRY.
00:46:11.561,00:46:13.563,"CHER, YOU'RE A VIRGIN?"
00:46:13.605,00:46:15.981,GOD! YOU SAY IT LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.
00:46:16.023,00:46:19.110,"BESIDES, THE PC TERM IS HYMENALLY CHALLENGED."
00:46:19.151,00:46:24.282,I AM NOT INTERESTED IN DOING IT UNTIL I FIND THE RIGHT PERSON.
00:46:24.323,00:46:26.534,YOU SEE HOW PICKY I AM ABOUT MY SHOES.
00:46:26.576,00:46:28.827,THEY ONLY GO ON MY FEET.
00:46:28.869,00:46:30.538,"YOU'RE ONE TO TALK, DEE."
00:46:30.580,00:46:32.707,"OH, WAIT A MINUTE!"
00:46:32.749,00:46:35.126,I THOUGHT THAT YOU AND MURRAY WERE...
00:46:35.167,00:46:36.586,MY MAN IS SATISFIED.
00:46:36.628,00:46:39.088,HE'S GOT NO CAUSE FOR COMPLAINTS.
00:46:39.130,00:46:40.590,"BUT TECHNICALLY, I AM A VIRGIN."
00:46:40.632,00:46:42.967,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
00:46:45.470,00:46:47.555,"OH, GOD."
00:46:47.597,00:46:48.889,"WHAT'S WRONG, TAI?"
00:46:48.931,00:46:53.519,THEY'RE PLAYING OUR SONG-- THE ONE THAT ELTON AND I DANCED TO.
00:46:53.561,00:46:55.688,OH.
00:46:58.065,00:46:59.609,"OH, TAI."
00:46:59.651,00:47:01.026,DON'T CRY.
00:47:01.068,00:47:02.528,I'M SORRY.
00:47:04.071,00:47:06.073,"OH, MY GOSH."
00:47:06.115,00:47:07.533,STOP!
00:47:07.575,00:47:14.915,"I COULD TELL TAI'S GRIEVING PERIOD WOULD BE CONSIDERABLE, UNLESS I FOUND SOMEONE TO TAKE ELTON'S PLACE RIGHT AWAY."
00:47:21.046,00:47:26.803,"I DON'T WANT TO BE A TRAITOR TO MY GENERATION, BUT I DON'T GET HOW GUYS DRESS TODAY."
00:47:26.843,00:47:33.184,IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST FELL OUT OF BED AND PUT ON SOME BAGGY PANTS AND TAKE THEIR GREASY HAIR-- UGH!
00:47:33.225,00:47:38.230,"AND COVER IT UP WITH A BACKWARDS CAP, AND, LIKE, WE'RE EXPECTED TO SWOON?"
00:47:38.272,00:47:39.940,I DON'T THINK SO.
00:47:41.942,00:47:49.950,SEARCHING FOR A BOY IN HIGH SCHOOL IS AS USELESS AS SEARCHING FOR MEANING IN A PAULY SHORE MOVIE.
00:48:15.059,00:48:18.521,SO THIS MUST BE THE ELUSIVE CHRISTIAN.
00:48:18.563,00:48:20.523,WHERE SHOULD I PARK?
00:48:20.565,00:48:22.899,THERE'S ONE.
00:48:24.360,00:48:26.028,O.K. O.K.
00:48:26.070,00:48:33.661,"NOW, I KNOW I SAID I WOULD FIND A GUY FOR TAI, BUT I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM IN FINDING ONE FOR MYSELF ALSO."
00:48:43.087,00:48:44.422,NICE STEMS.
00:48:44.463,00:48:45.840,THANKS.
00:48:47.675,00:48:49.051,CHER?

00:48:50.595,00:48:52.137,WE ESTABLISHED THAT DURING ATTENDANCE.
00:48:52.179,00:48:53.972,IT'S TIME FOR YOUR ORAL.
00:48:54.014,00:48:55.767,EXCUSE ME?
00:48:55.808,00:48:59.019,YOUR ORIGINAL ORAL.
00:48:59.061,00:49:01.105,OH!
00:49:02.356,00:49:04.024,"SO, O.K."
00:49:04.066,00:49:09.405,"THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE ON TV, AND THAT SHOULD STOP."
00:49:09.447,00:49:13.409,"EVEN IF YOU TOOK OUT ALL THE VIOLENT SHOWS, YOU COULD STILL SEE THE NEWS."
00:49:13.451,00:49:23.001,"SO UNTIL MANKIND IS PEACEFUL ENOUGH NOT TO HAVE VIOLENCE ON THE NEWS, THERE'S NO POINT IN TAKING IT OUT OF SHOWS THAT NEED IT FOR ENTERTAINMENT VALUE."
00:49:23.043,00:49:24.796,THANK YOU.
00:49:31.051,00:49:33.554,ANY COMMENTS?
00:49:33.596,00:49:35.556,MY FOOT HURTS.

00:49:37.600,00:49:39.518,TWO VERY ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP.
00:49:39.560,00:49:42.020,FINE HOLIDAY FUN.
00:49:42.062,00:49:45.608,HELLO? WAS I THE ONLY ONE LISTENING?
00:49:45.650,00:49:48.026,"I MEAN, I THOUGHT IT REEKED."
00:49:48.068,00:49:51.029,I BELIEVE THAT WAS YOUR DESIGNER IMPOSTOR PERFUME.
00:49:56.076,00:49:57.453,I DUG IT.
00:50:07.087,00:50:11.550,"DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS, I DID WHAT ANY NORMAL GIRL WOULD DO."
00:50:11.592,00:50:19.057,"I SENT MYSELF LOVE LETTERS AND FLOWERS AND CANDY, JUST SO HE'D SEE HOW DESIRED I WAS IN CASE HE DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW."
00:50:29.610,00:50:35.324,AND ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO DRAW ATTENTION TO YOUR MOUTH IS GOOD.
00:50:35.366,00:50:38.786,"ALSO, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO SHOW A LITTLE SKIN."
00:50:38.828,00:50:43.207,"THIS REMINDS GUYS OF BEING NAKED, AND THEN THEY THINK OF SEX."
00:50:45.626,00:50:46.585,"HEY, DUCHESS?"
00:50:46.627,00:50:48.086,YES?

00:50:52.633,00:50:56.888,"I'M NEW, BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU HAD AN IN ON THE HEAVY CLAMBAKES."
00:50:56.929,00:51:01.057,"WELL, MY EX-STEPBROTHER'S FRIENDS ARE HAVING A PARTY."

00:51:17.115,00:51:20.327,I CAN'T OPEN IT.
00:51:20.369,00:51:21.954,THEN HE CAN WAIT OUTSIDE.
00:51:21.996,00:51:23.998,"JOSH, PLEASE!"
00:51:24.040,00:51:27.418,"COME ON, JOSH!"

00:51:59.283,00:52:03.079,YOU THINK I'D GIVE ALCOHOL TO TEEN-AGE DRIVERS TAKING MY DAUGHTER OUT?
00:52:03.119,00:52:04.496,THE PROTECTIVE VIBE.
00:52:04.538,00:52:09.001,YOU THINK THE DEATH OF SAMMY DAVIS LEFT AN OPENING IN THE RAT PACK?
00:52:17.802,00:52:19.135,CHRISTIAN.

00:52:25.768,00:52:29.229,"YOU'RE NOT LETTING HER GO OUT LIKE THAT, ARE YOU?"
00:52:29.271,00:52:30.522,"CHER, GET IN HERE."
00:52:30.564,00:52:32.608,WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

00:52:34.652,00:52:35.945,CALVIN KLEIN.
00:52:35.987,00:52:37.446,IT LOOKS LIKE UNDERWEAR.
00:52:37.488,00:52:39.197,GO UPSTAIRS AND PUT SOMETHING OVER IT.
00:52:39.239,00:52:43.077,TSCHA! I WAS JUST GOING TO.

00:52:44.870,00:52:48.582,"ANYTHING HAPPENS TO MY DAUGHTER, I GOT A .45 AND A SHOVEL."
00:52:48.624,00:52:51.085,I DOUBT ANYBODY WOULD MISS YOU.
00:52:51.127,00:52:52.461,"BYE, DADDY."

00:53:14.066,00:53:16.819,I LOVE HIM.
00:53:24.869,00:53:26.495,I DIDN'T LIKE HIM.
00:53:26.537,00:53:27.746,WHAT'S TO LIKE?
00:53:27.788,00:53:29.414,MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO THE PARTY.
00:53:29.456,00:53:31.333,IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD GO...
00:53:31.375,00:53:33.251,"YOU DON'T NEED ME, DO YOU?"

00:55:10.557,00:55:13.018,NO. HE'S PROBABLY JUST DANCING WITH HER.
00:55:18.065,00:55:19.524,DO YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTY?
00:55:19.566,00:55:21.026,NO. SHE'S A MONET.
00:55:21.068,00:55:22.527,WHAT'S A MONET?
00:55:22.569,00:55:24.029,"IT'S LIKE THE PAINTINGS, SEE?"
00:55:24.071,00:55:25.530,"FROM FAR AWAY, IT'S O.K."
00:55:25.572,00:55:28.033,"UP CLOSE, IT'S A BIG OLD MESS."

00:55:30.577,00:55:32.037,HAGSVILLE.
00:55:32.079,00:55:33.538,SEE?
00:55:33.580,00:55:36.583,THEY'RE CHARGING FOR BREWSKIES.

00:55:57.855,00:55:59.815,"I MEAN, LOOK HOW HE IGNORES EVERY OTHER GIRL."
00:56:05.445,00:56:09.616,"OH, GOD, LOOK."
00:56:09.658,00:56:15.622,"HE FINDS THE ONLY ADULT IN HERE, LIKE HE'S DELIBERATELY TRYING TO NOT HAVE FUN."
00:56:15.664,00:56:17.166,"CHER, I HAVE A QUESTION."
00:56:17.208,00:56:19.668,WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THIS THING?
00:56:19.710,00:56:24.006,SHOULD I TIE IT AROUND OR PUT IT OVER-- TIE IT AROUND YOUR WAIST.

00:58:15.826,00:58:18.329,I CAN TAKE THE GIRLS HOME.
00:58:18.370,00:58:19.955,NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
00:58:19.997,00:58:22.207,NO. IT'S FINE. STAY.
00:58:22.249,00:58:25.502,"YEAH, SURE."
00:58:25.543,00:58:28.380,YOU ARE A DOWN GIRL.
00:58:30.882,00:58:33.510,IT WAS REALLY DECENT OF YOU TO DANCE WITH TAI.
00:58:33.551,00:58:34.803,MY PLEASURE.
00:58:34.845,00:58:37.139,YOU NOTICE ANY POSITIVE CHANGES IN HER?
00:58:37.181,00:58:39.391,YEAH.
00:58:37.181,00:58:43.937,"UNDER YOUR TUTELAGE, SHE'S EXPLORING THE CHALLENGING WORLD OF BARE MIDRIFFS."
00:58:43.979,00:58:49.026,SO YOU DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A NIGHT OF IT WITH THE RING-A-DING KID?
00:58:49.067,00:58:50.527,DADDY WON'T GO TOO BALLISTIC.
00:58:50.568,00:58:52.279,IT'S NOT LIKE HE'LL SLEEP.
00:58:52.321,00:58:54.698,NOT IF THEY'RE GOING TO FINISH THOSE DEPOS.
00:58:54.739,00:58:58.535,IT WOULD BE DOPE IF WE GOT SOME REALLY DELICIOUS TAKE-OUT.
00:58:58.576,00:59:00.787,I BET THEY HAVEN'T EATEN ALL NIGHT.
00:59:00.829,00:59:03.207,THAT WOULD BE PRETTY...DOPE OF US.
00:59:04.958,00:59:06.877,LET'S DO IT.
00:59:09.796,00:59:14.343,"THE MIDNIGHT SNACK TOTALLY REVIVED THE LAWYERS, AND DADDY WAS WAY GRATEFUL."
00:59:14.385,00:59:15.969,EAT ORANGES.
00:59:16.011,00:59:17.471,"DADDY, NO!"
00:59:17.513,00:59:18.972,"CHER, COME ON."
00:59:19.014,00:59:20.432,YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT.
00:59:20.474,00:59:26.480,"I KNOW IT SOUNDS MENTAL, BUT SOMETIMES I HAVE MORE FUN VEGGING OUT THAN WHEN I GO PARTYING."
00:59:26.522,00:59:28.982,MAYBE BECAUSE MY PARTY CLOTHES ARE SO BINDING.
00:59:29.024,00:59:31.985,HOW MANY HOURS A DAY DO YOU SPEND GROOMING YOURSELF?
00:59:32.027,00:59:35.989,SOME PEOPLE AREN'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE AS NATURALLY ADORABLE AS YOU ARE.
00:59:36.031,00:59:38.158,STOP IT. YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.
00:59:39.535,00:59:40.994,HELLO.
00:59:41.036,00:59:42.496,"HI, CHER."
00:59:42.538,00:59:43.997,"HI, GAIL."
00:59:44.039,00:59:46.791,"IS MY SON THERE, CLEANING OUT YOUR REFRIGERATOR?"
00:59:46.833,00:59:49.420,"NO, NO, HE'S NOT HERE."
00:59:49.461,00:59:51.004,YOU SHOULD TRY THE DORMS.
00:59:51.046,00:59:52.506,ALL RIGHT.
00:59:52.548,00:59:53.507,BYE-BYE.
00:59:53.549,00:59:55.175,WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
00:59:55.217,00:59:57.135,SHE WANTS ME TO COME HOME FOR SPRING BREAK.
00:59:57.177,00:59:59.430,SO? NOBODY WILL BE IN SCHOOL.
00:59:59.471,01:00:04.601,"HUSBAND NUMBER FOUR'S AT HOME, AND HIS IDEA OF ACTING LIKE A FAMILY IS TO CRITICIZE ME."
01:00:04.642,01:00:07.020,YOU'RE GOING TO ROAM AROUND CAMPUS BY YOURSELF?
01:00:07.062,01:00:08.605,I DON'T MIND.
01:00:08.646,01:00:10.107,THAT IS STUPID.
01:00:10.148,01:00:12.025,COME HERE.
01:00:12.067,01:00:14.528,THERE WILL BE SOME GREAT PARTIES.
01:00:14.570,01:00:15.820,NO.
01:00:15.862,01:00:17.322,WHY NOT?
01:00:17.364,01:00:19.491,YOU GOT YOUR WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD GOING ON.
01:00:19.533,01:00:21.410,I'D GET IN THE WAY.
01:00:21.452,01:00:23.454,YOU WON'T BE IN THE WAY.
01:00:23.495,01:00:26.331,HOW MUCH FUN WOULD IT BE HAVING A BROTHER-TYPE TAGGING ALONG?
01:00:26.373,01:00:28.417,"JOSH, YOU'RE NOT MY BROTHER."
01:00:28.459,01:00:30.919,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
01:00:30.961,01:00:32.921,COME ON. YOU NEED SOME EXCITEMENT IN YOUR LIFE.
01:00:32.963,01:00:35.173,IT WILL REPLENISH YOU FOR YOUR FINALS.
01:00:37.509,01:00:38.676,O.K.
01:00:38.718,01:00:39.886,GOOD.
01:00:41.555,01:00:45.809,I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M TAKING ADVICE FROM SOMEONE WHO WATCHES CARTOONS.
01:00:45.850,01:00:48.395,"BE QUIET, YOU IDIOT!"
01:00:48.437,01:00:50.021,THAT'S REN &amp; STIMPY.
01:00:50.063,01:00:52.649,THEY'RE WAY EXISTENTIAL.
01:00:52.690,01:00:55.611,DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?
01:00:55.652,01:00:58.530,"NO. WHY, DO I SOUND LIKE I DO?"
01:00:58.572,01:01:01.074,HA HA!
01:01:10.292,01:01:12.544,CHRISTIAN SAID HE'D CALL THE NEXT DAY.
01:01:12.586,01:01:14.546,"IN BOY TIME, THAT MEANT THURSDAY."
01:01:14.588,01:01:18.467,YOU CAN IMAGINE MY ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR FROM HIM WHILE I WAS PACKING DADDY UP.
01:01:18.509,01:01:22.095,HE SAID HE'D COME OVER WITH SOME VIDEOTAPES.
01:01:22.137,01:01:24.097,A NIGHT ALONE WITH CHRISTIAN?
01:01:24.139,01:01:26.766,I SENT FOR REINFORCEMENTS.
01:01:26.808,01:01:31.188,THEN DEE AND I HAD TO DESIGN A LIGHTING CONCEPT.
01:01:31.229,01:01:32.689,AND COSTUME DECISIONS.
01:01:32.730,01:01:36.901,"I DON'T RELY ON MIRRORS, SO I ALWAYS TAKE POLAROIDS."
01:01:39.696,01:01:42.907,"WHENEVER A BOY COMES, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING BAKING."
01:01:52.876,01:01:55.920,OH...I'M STILL ALL RED!
01:01:55.962,01:01:59.090,"I'M TRYING TO MAKE YOU AS WHITE AS I CAN, CHER."
01:01:59.132,01:02:01.176,"LOOK, YOU'RE ALL FLUSHED."
01:02:01.218,01:02:03.094,"YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN, O.K.?"
01:02:03.136,01:02:05.055,CALM.
01:02:05.096,01:02:14.523,"YOU KNOW, I AM SO GLAD I NEVER DID IT WITH SOMEONE I HAD LUKEWARM FEELINGS FOR BECAUSE CHRISTIAN IS BRUTALLY HOT, AND I AM GOING TO REMEMBER TONIGHT FOREVER."
01:02:14.565,01:02:15.732,BLOT.
01:02:23.073,01:02:24.533,HI.
01:02:24.575,01:02:25.950,HI.
01:02:28.078,01:02:30.539,IS SOMETHING BURNING?
01:02:30.581,01:02:31.956,"OH, MY GOD!"
01:02:39.089,01:02:40.549,OOPS.
01:02:40.591,01:02:43.051,"AW, HONEY, YOU BAKED."
01:02:43.093,01:02:45.053,I TRIED.
01:02:45.095,01:02:48.473,COME ON. SHOW ME THE REST OF YOUR PAD.
01:02:50.892,01:02:53.853,YOUR FATHER HAS A WELL-ROUNDED COLLECTION.
01:02:53.895,01:02:56.064,DADDY SAYS IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT.
01:02:56.106,01:02:57.566,HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
01:02:57.608,01:02:58.567,CLAES OLDENBURG.
01:02:58.609,01:03:00.569,HE'S WAY FAMOUS.
01:03:00.611,01:03:02.070,OOH.
01:03:02.112,01:03:04.531,"BUT THIS IS OLDER, SEE?"
01:03:04.573,01:03:06.032,TRANSITIONAL.
01:03:06.074,01:03:08.034,A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE.
01:03:08.076,01:03:10.537,"UM, YOU WANT TO GO SWIMMING?"
01:03:10.579,01:03:13.039,MMM.
01:03:13.081,01:03:14.541,LET'S WATCH THE MOVIES.
01:03:14.583,01:03:16.376,"OH, O.K."
01:03:16.418,01:03:22.924,"CHRISTIAN HAD A THING FOR TONY CURTIS, SO HE BROUGHT OVER SOME LIKE IT HOT AND SPARATACUS."
01:03:22.966,01:03:25.176,SINGER OF SONGS.
01:03:25.218,01:03:28.096,FOR WHOM DID YOU PRACTICE THIS WONDROUS TALENT?
01:03:28.138,01:03:32.768,"FOR THE CHILDREN OF MY MASTER, WHOM I ALSO TAUGHT THE CLASSICS."
01:03:32.809,01:03:34.561,"CLASSICS, INDEED?"
01:03:34.603,01:03:39.899,"WHAT POSITION HAVE WE, I WONDER, FOR A BOY OF SUCH VARIED GIFTS?"
01:03:41.443,01:03:43.903,YOU SHALL BE MY BODY SERVANT.
01:03:43.945,01:03:45.447,"ALL OF YOU, COME WITH ME."

01:04:05.550,01:04:07.010,ARE YOU O.K.?
01:04:07.051,01:04:08.512,"UH, I'M FINE."
01:04:08.553,01:04:11.014,"UM, DO YOU WANT SOME-- SOMETHING TO DRINK?"
01:04:11.055,01:04:12.641,I COULD GET YOU SOME WINE.
01:04:12.683,01:04:17.521,"NO. YOU NOTICE HOW WINE MAKES PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL, LIKE, SEXY?"
01:04:17.562,01:04:19.397,"WELL, THAT'S O.K."
01:04:22.567,01:04:26.863,I'M ACTUALLY GETTING TIRED.
01:04:26.904,01:04:29.574,BUT I CAN MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE IF YOU'D LIKE.
01:04:29.616,01:04:32.035,"OH, NO, THANKS."
01:04:32.076,01:04:35.539,BUT YOU HAD ALL THOSE CAPPUCCINOS BEFORE.
01:04:35.580,01:04:39.710,"OH. WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS, LIKE, UH, FOAM."
01:04:44.589,01:04:46.049,YOU'RE GREAT.
01:04:46.090,01:04:48.552,"WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT?"

01:04:54.599,01:04:55.933,SEE YOU.
01:05:01.105,01:05:03.066,I DON'T GET IT.
01:05:03.107,01:05:04.984,DID MY HAIR GET FLAT?
01:05:05.026,01:05:07.487,DID I STUMBLE INTO SOME BAD LIGHTING?
01:05:07.529,01:05:09.531,WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
01:05:09.573,01:05:10.990,NOTHING.
01:05:11.032,01:05:12.325,MAYBE HE REALLY WAS TIRED.
01:05:12.367,01:05:14.494,I SUPPOSE IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.
01:05:14.536,01:05:16.496,HE DOES DRESS BETTER THAN I DO.
01:05:16.538,01:05:18.498,WHAT WOULD I BRING TO THE RELATIONSHIP?
01:05:18.540,01:05:21.251,GET BACK INTO THE RIGHT LANE-- WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO?
01:05:21.292,01:05:25.004,FIRST THING I DO IS I PUT ON MY BLINKER.
01:05:25.046,01:05:26.506,"OH, WAIT. SHIT."
01:05:26.548,01:05:28.007,WATCH THE ROAD!
01:05:28.049,01:05:30.510,STOP. THEN I LOOK IN MY MIRROR. O.K.
01:05:30.552,01:05:34.222,THEN I GLANCE AT MY BLIND SPOT.
01:05:34.264,01:05:36.808,"WITH YOUR HEAD, NOT THE WHOLE CAR!"
01:05:36.850,01:05:39.519,I SWEAR TO GOD.
01:05:39.561,01:05:40.937,YOU CAN'T DRIVE FOR SHIT!
01:05:40.978,01:05:42.397,I'M NOT TRYING TO HEAR THAT.
01:05:42.439,01:05:47.527,"HEAR ME! YOU-- ACTUALLY, GOING ALL THE WAY IS, LIKE, A REALLY BIG DECISION."
01:05:47.569,01:05:50.530,I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS SO CAPRICIOUS ABOUT IT.
01:05:50.572,01:05:52.198,"DEE, I ALMOST HAD SEX WITH HIM."
01:05:52.240,01:05:53.617,YOU ALMOST HAD SEX WITH WHO?
01:05:53.658,01:05:54.826,CHRISTIAN.
01:05:56.620,01:05:59.163,WHAT?
01:05:59.205,01:06:01.750,"YO, LOOK!"
01:06:01.792,01:06:03.627,YOUR MAN CHRISTIAN IS A CAKE BOY.
01:06:03.668,01:06:05.086,A WHAT?
01:06:05.128,01:06:10.049,"HE'S A DISCO-DANCING, OSCAR-WILDE-READING, STREISAND-TICKET-HOLDING FRIEND OF DOROTHY."
01:06:10.091,01:06:12.009,UH-UH. NO WAY.
01:06:12.051,01:06:13.010,HE'S GAY.
01:06:13.052,01:06:14.011,NOT EVEN.
01:06:14.053,01:06:15.138,"YES, EVEN."
01:06:15.179,01:06:18.850,"HE DOES LIKE TO SHOP, CHER, AND THE BOY CAN DRESS."
01:06:18.892,01:06:21.352,"OH, MY GOD."
01:06:21.394,01:06:24.272,I FEEL LIKE SUCH A BONEHEAD.

01:06:56.513,01:06:58.682,AAH!
01:06:58.723,01:07:02.894,"WHATEVER YOU DO, KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE WHEEL AT ALL TIMES!"
01:07:02.936,01:07:05.021,AAH!
01:07:10.694,01:07:12.153,"LOOK, JUST GO!"

01:07:17.325,01:07:18.785,"ALL RIGHT, WE'RE OFF."
01:07:18.827,01:07:20.495,WOO!

01:07:22.539,01:07:25.000,"IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY."
01:07:25.041,01:07:26.501,"HONEY, RELAX."
01:07:26.543,01:07:28.503,"BREATHE, BREATHE."
01:07:30.046,01:07:32.007,LET IT OUT.
01:07:32.048,01:07:33.925,"RELAX, RELAX."
01:07:33.967,01:07:38.805,"BOY, GETTING OFF THE FREEWAY MAKES YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT LOVE IS."
01:07:38.847,01:07:42.517,"AFTER THAT, DIONNE'S VIRGINITY WENT FROM TECHNICAL TO NONEXISTENT."
01:07:42.559,01:07:47.230,I REALIZED HOW MUCH I WANTED A BOYFRIEND OF MY OWN.
01:07:47.271,01:07:50.525,NOT THAT CHRISTIAN WASN'T A BLAST TO HANG OUT WITH.
01:07:50.567,01:07:53.528,HE WAS BECOMING ONE OF MY FAVORITE SHOPPING PARTNERS.
01:07:53.570,01:07:54.946,SO WAS THE RED.
01:07:56.573,01:07:58.033,"UM, WHERE'S TAI?"
01:07:58.074,01:08:02.412,SHE MET SOME RANDOM GUYS AT THE FOOT LOCKER AND ESCORTED THEM RIGHT OVER THERE.
01:08:02.453,01:08:04.039,"OH, MY GOD! DID YOU..."
01:08:04.080,01:08:05.999,I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE MEETS THESE BARNEYS.
01:08:06.041,01:08:07.500,"I HAVE A QUESTION, ALL RIGHT?"
01:08:07.542,01:08:08.668,WHAT?
01:08:08.710,01:08:13.006,THE JACKET-- IS IT JAMES DEAN OR JASON PRIESTLEY?
01:08:13.048,01:08:14.507,"CARPE DIEM, O.K.?"
01:08:14.549,01:08:17.468,YOU LOOKED HOT IN IT.
01:08:17.510,01:08:20.055,"IF I FALL, WOULD YOU GUYS CATCH ME?"
01:08:20.096,01:08:22.390,COULD THEY PLEASE BE MORE GENERIC?

01:08:37.321,01:08:38.448,YOU ASSHOLE!
01:08:38.489,01:08:39.574,"HEY, MAN, WE'RE JUST JOKING."
01:08:39.616,01:08:41.034,"OH, REALLY?"
01:08:41.076,01:08:42.702,SOMEBODY COULD GET KILLED.
01:08:42.744,01:08:45.038,"OH, MY GOD."
01:08:45.080,01:08:46.539,I WAS SITTING THERE.
01:08:46.581,01:08:48.541,I WAS TALKING TO THOSE GUYS.
01:08:48.583,01:08:52.211,"ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE WERE LAUGHING AND-- HEY, YOU O.K.?"
01:08:52.253,01:08:53.630,Y-YEAH.

01:09:01.096,01:09:07.435,"BOY, CONSIDERING HOW CLUELESS SHE WAS, TAI CERTAINLY HAD THAT DAMSEL-IN-DISTRESS ACT DOWN."
01:09:07.477,01:09:13.566,"MEANWHILE, BACK AT SCHOOL, EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT TAI'S BRUSH WITH DEATH AT THE MALL."
01:09:13.608,01:09:16.486,WAS IT A MONTAGE OF ALL THE SCENES IN YOUR LIFE?
01:09:16.527,01:09:18.321,NOT EXACTLY A MONTAGE.
01:09:18.362,01:09:21.992,"HEY, CHER, IS IT TRUE GANG MEMBERS TRIED TO SHOOT TAI?"
01:09:22.033,01:09:23.159,NO.
01:09:23.200,01:09:24.661,THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING.
01:09:24.702,01:09:25.870,WHATEVER.
01:09:27.872,01:09:31.001,"WHEN I WAS 9, I FELL OFF THIS JUNGLE GYM."
01:09:31.042,01:09:35.505,I SWEAR I SAW THIS-- WILL YOU MOVE DOWN FOR CHER?
01:09:35.546,01:09:37.381,TELL ME MORE.
01:09:37.423,01:09:39.009,WHERE WAS I?

01:09:41.552,01:09:43.013,"OH, RIGHT, RIGHT."
01:09:43.054,01:09:46.557,"RIGHT BEFORE YOU DIE, YOUR MIND JUST SORT OF GETS VERY CLEAR."
01:09:46.599,01:09:49.477,IT'S A VERY INTENSE SPIRITUAL THING.
01:09:49.519,01:09:53.023,I KNOW WHEN I WAS HELD AT GUNPOINT-- EXCUSE ME.
01:09:53.064,01:09:54.190,IT'S SPIRITUAL.
01:09:54.231,01:09:56.233,I CAN'T PINPOINT THE SPIRITUALITY.
01:09:56.275,01:10:02.406,"IF YOU'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING-- TAI, I WAS PLANNING ON GOING TO TOWER AND GETTING SOMETHING FOR CHRISTIAN."
01:10:02.448,01:10:03.741,UH-HUH.
01:10:03.783,01:10:06.077,LIKE SOME KIND OF PRESENT OR SOMETHING.

01:10:16.546,01:10:20.008,"OH. WELL, HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?"
01:10:20.050,01:10:22.969,DO YOU THINK WE COULD DO IT NEXT MONDAY?
01:10:23.011,01:10:24.971,MY WEEK'S FILLING UP FAST HERE.
01:10:25.013,01:10:28.349,"WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM THE IHOP, IT WAS 8:00."
01:10:28.391,01:10:29.851,HERE COMES YOUR BOYFRIEND.
01:10:29.893,01:10:32.478,"TAI, CHECK IT OUT."

01:10:36.524,01:10:37.984,NO.
01:10:38.026,01:10:41.404,DON'T THE SLACKERS PREFER THAT GRASSY KNOLL OVER THERE?
01:10:48.536,01:10:51.998,"TAI, SO ANYWAY, HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT IN WATER?"
01:10:52.040,01:10:53.332,"OH, YEAH."
01:10:53.374,01:10:54.667,REALLY?
01:10:54.709,01:10:57.253,WHAT WAS HAPPENING?
01:10:57.294,01:11:00.048,DIONNE ASKING TAI FOR SEX ADVICE?
01:11:00.090,01:11:03.801,TAI BEING THE MOST POPULAR GIRL IN THE SCHOOL?
01:11:03.843,01:11:07.055,IT WAS LIKE SOME SORT OF ALTERNATE UNIVERSE.
01:11:08.556,01:11:16.773,"ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE DRIVING TEST, SO I HAD TO FIND MY MOST RESPONSIBLE-LOOKING ENSEMBLE."
01:11:16.814,01:11:21.569,WHERE'S MY WHITE COLLARLESS SHIRT?
01:11:21.611,01:11:23.071,"LUCY, WHERE'S MY SHIRT?"
01:11:23.113,01:11:24.572,PROBABLY AT THE CLEANER.
01:11:24.614,01:11:27.075,"OH, BUT TODAY'S THE DRIVING TEST."
01:11:27.117,01:11:29.077,IT'S MY MOST CAPABLE-LOOKING OUTFIT.
01:11:29.119,01:11:31.370,"O.K., I CALL THEM."
01:11:31.412,01:11:33.039,"OH, IT'S TOO LATE NOW."
01:11:33.081,01:11:38.544,"OH, WE GOT ANOTHER NOTICE FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, SAYING WE HAVE TO CLEAR OUT THE BUSH."
01:11:38.586,01:11:40.546,YOU SAID JOSE WOULD DO IT.
01:11:40.588,01:11:42.548,HE YOUR GARDENER.
01:11:42.590,01:11:44.050,"LUCY, I DON'T SPEAK MEXICAN."
01:11:44.092,01:11:45.551,I NOT A MEXICAN!
01:11:45.593,01:11:47.553,GREAT. WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?
01:11:47.595,01:11:49.555,LUCY'S FROM EL SALVADOR.
01:11:49.597,01:11:51.015,SO?
01:11:51.057,01:11:52.892,IT'S AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT COUNTRY.
01:11:52.934,01:11:54.769,WHAT DOES THAT MATTER?
01:11:54.811,01:11:57.272,YOU GET UPSET IF SOMEONE THINKS YOU LIVE BELOW SUNSET.
01:11:57.313,01:11:58.898,SO EVERYTHING IS ALL MY FAULT.
01:11:58.940,01:12:00.066,"I'M ALWAYS WRONG, RIGHT?"
01:12:00.108,01:12:01.651,YOU'RE SUCH A BRAT.
01:12:01.692,01:12:04.070,I HAD AN OVERWHELMING SENSE OF ICKYNESS.
01:12:04.112,01:12:07.907,"EVEN THOUGH I APOLOGIZED TO LUCY, SOMETHING WAS STILL PLAGUING ME."
01:12:10.201,01:12:12.620,LIKE JOSH THINKING I WAS MEAN WAS MAKING ME POSTAL.
01:12:12.662,01:12:15.248,MOVE INTO THE RIGHT LANE.
01:12:15.290,01:12:17.541,"ANYWAY, WHY SHOULD I CARE WHAT JOSH THINKS?"
01:12:17.583,01:12:19.919,WHY WAS I LETTING IT THROW ME INTO SUCH TURMOIL?
01:12:19.961,01:12:23.214,WATCH OUT FOR THE BIKE RID-- OOPS! MY BAD.
01:12:23.256,01:12:25.091,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
01:12:25.133,01:12:27.593,YOU CAN'T TAKE UP BOTH LANES.
01:12:27.635,01:12:28.886,GET IN THE RIGHT LANE.
01:12:28.928,01:12:33.557,NOT SO-- OOH! SHOULD I WRITE THEM A NOTE?
01:12:33.599,01:12:37.603,PULL OVER UP HERE AND TURN OFF THE ENGINE.
01:12:37.645,01:12:39.063,RIGHT THERE.
01:12:39.105,01:12:41.274,OH!
01:12:41.316,01:12:45.862,ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE TO MAKE LEFT-HAND TURNS?
01:12:45.903,01:12:47.280,WE'RE GOING BACK.
01:12:47.322,01:12:48.364,IT'S OVER?
01:12:48.405,01:12:50.283,IT'S OVER.
01:12:50.325,01:12:52.869,"WELL, HOW DID I DO?"
01:12:52.910,01:12:56.080,HOW DID YOU DO?
01:12:56.122,01:13:03.171,"YOU CAN'T PARK, YOU CAN'T SWITCH LANES, YOU CAN'T MAKE RIGHT-HAND TURNS, YOU'VE DAMAGED PRIVATE PROPERTY, AND YOU ALMOST KILLED SOMEONE."
01:13:03.213,01:13:05.548,"OFFHAND, I'D SAY YOU FAILED."
01:13:05.589,01:13:07.008,FAILED?
01:13:07.050,01:13:09.344,"WELL, CAN'T WE JUST START OVER?"
01:13:09.385,01:13:11.721,"I MEAN, I'M KIND OF HAVING A PERSONAL PROBLEM."
01:13:11.762,01:13:13.139,MY MIND WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE.
01:13:13.181,01:13:16.017,THAT BIKER CAME OUT OF NOWHERE!
01:13:16.059,01:13:18.686,OH! I SWEAR I'LL CONCENTRATE!
01:13:18.728,01:13:20.730,"I DRIVE REALLY GOOD, USUALLY."
01:13:20.771,01:13:24.067,ISN'T THERE SOMEBODY ELSE I CAN TALK TO?
01:13:24.108,01:13:28.279,YOU CAN'T BE THE ABSOLUTE AND FINAL WORD IN DRIVER'S LICENSES.
01:13:28.321,01:13:33.743,"GIRLIE, AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, I'M THE MESSIAH OF THE DMV."
01:13:33.784,01:13:35.953,"NOW, GET OUT OF THE CAR."
01:13:50.093,01:13:52.053,I CAN'T BELIEVE I FAILED.
01:13:52.095,01:13:55.973,I FAILED SOMETHING I COULDN'T TALK MY WAY OUT OF?
01:13:59.727,01:14:01.562,"GO AHEAD, YEAH."
01:14:01.604,01:14:03.564,PUT YOUR LEGS INTO ME.
01:14:03.606,01:14:06.150,"HEY, YOU'RE HOME."
01:14:06.192,01:14:07.944,HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE A LICENSE?
01:14:07.985,01:14:10.738,I WOULDN'T KNOW.
01:14:10.780,01:14:12.990,OH. BUMMER.
01:14:13.032,01:14:18.579,"AND, JOSH, SPARE ME YOUR LECTURES ON HOW DRIVING IS SUCH A BIG RESPONSIBILITY AND YOU CAN'T B.S."
01:14:18.621,01:14:20.831,I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
01:14:20.873,01:14:22.125,I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
01:14:29.506,01:14:31.801,I GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
01:14:31.842,01:14:34.053,I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR TEST.
01:14:34.095,01:14:36.055,I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
01:14:36.097,01:14:38.057,THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO DO.
01:14:38.099,01:14:40.559,I NEED YOU HERE.
01:14:40.601,01:14:42.561,YEAH.
01:14:42.603,01:14:46.065,A BUNCH OF JUNK THAT REMINDED ME OF ELTON.
01:14:46.107,01:14:49.568,I WANT TO BURN IT BECAUSE I'M SO OVER HIM.
01:14:49.610,01:14:51.070,WHAT STUFF?
01:14:51.112,01:14:59.078,DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE AT THE VAL PARTY AND THE CLOG KNOCKING ME OUT AND ELTON GOT A TOWEL OF ICE?
01:14:59.120,01:15:04.083,"I DIDN'T TELL YOU AT THE TIME, BUT I TOOK THE TOWEL AS A SOUVENIR."
01:15:04.125,01:15:05.501,YOU'RE KIDDING.
01:15:05.542,01:15:06.627,NO.
01:15:06.669,01:15:08.421,AND THEN...
01:15:08.463,01:15:11.090,REMEMBER THAT SONG THAT WAS PLAYING WHEN WE DANCED?
01:15:11.132,01:15:12.549,REMEMBER THAT?
01:15:12.591,01:15:15.386,"YOU KNOW, ROLLIN' WITH THE HOMIES."
01:15:15.428,01:15:17.513,"ANYWAYS, I GOT THE TAPE, RIGHT?"
01:15:17.554,01:15:20.433,"I LISTENED TO IT, LIKE, EVERY SINGLE NIGHT."
01:15:20.475,01:15:22.518,"DON'T BURN THAT, O.K.?"
01:15:22.559,01:15:29.025,"TAI, I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU, BUT WHAT BROUGHT ON THIS SURGE OF EMPOWERMENT?"
01:15:29.066,01:15:36.366,"IT'S, LIKE, I MET THIS GUY WHO'S SO TOTALLY AMAZING THAT HE MAKES ELTON LOOK LIKE A LOSER."
01:15:36.407,01:15:38.284,THAT IS SO GREAT.
01:15:38.326,01:15:41.329,"LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME GET JOSH."
01:15:41.371,01:15:43.831,GET JOSH WHAT?
01:15:43.873,01:15:46.167,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
01:15:46.209,01:15:47.668,I LIKE HIM.
01:15:47.710,01:15:50.171,DO YOU THINK THAT HE LIKES YOU?
01:15:50.213,01:15:51.130,YEAH.
01:15:51.172,01:15:52.631,HOW DO YOU KNOW?
01:15:52.673,01:15:54.633,"LIKE, LITTLE THINGS, YOU KNOW?"
01:15:54.675,01:15:59.389,"LIKE, HE ALWAYS FINDS SOME SORT OF WAY TO TOUCH ME OR TICKLE ME."
01:15:59.430,01:16:04.060,DO YOU REMEMBER THE TIME AT THE FRAT WHEN I WAS TOTALLY DEPRESSED?
01:16:04.101,01:16:06.854,"WE DANCED, AND HE WAS REALLY FLIRTY."
01:16:06.896,01:16:09.065,YOU O.K.?
01:16:09.106,01:16:12.985,"YEAH. OH, ACTUALLY..."
01:16:13.027,01:16:14.987,I HAD TWO MOCHACCINOS.
01:16:15.029,01:16:16.489,I FEEL LIKE RALPHING.
01:16:16.531,01:16:18.991,I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT FEELS.
01:16:19.033,01:16:26.499,"LIKE, THE OTHER DAY, I WAS TALKING TO JOSH, AND WE WERE DISCUSSING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS AND COLLEGE GIRLS."
01:16:26.541,01:16:29.001,COLLEGE GIRLS WEAR LESS MAKE-UP.
01:16:29.043,01:16:31.087,THAT'S WHY GUYS LIKE THEM MORE.
01:16:31.128,01:16:35.007,"BUT, TAI, DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU'D BE GOOD WITH JOSH?"
01:16:35.049,01:16:38.052,"I MEAN, HE'S, LIKE, A SCHOOL NERD."
01:16:38.094,01:16:40.763,AM I SOME SORT OF A MENTALLY CHALLENGED AIRHEAD?
01:16:40.804,01:16:44.725,NO! NOT EVEN!
01:16:44.767,01:16:47.186,I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR JOSH OR SOMETHING?
01:16:47.228,01:16:53.650,I--I JUST...DON'T THINK YOU MESH WELL TOGETHER.
01:16:53.692,01:16:56.237,YOU DON'T THINK THAT WE MESH WELL?
01:16:56.279,01:16:59.949,WHY AM I EVEN LISTENING TO YOU TO BEGIN WITH?
01:16:59.990,01:17:04.454,YOU'RE A VIRGIN WHO CAN'T DRIVE.
01:17:07.540,01:17:10.876,"OH, THAT WAS WAY HARSH, TAI."
01:17:10.918,01:17:14.004,"ALL RIGHT. LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY."
01:17:14.046,01:17:17.007,"LET'S JUST TALK WHEN WE'VE MELLOWED, ALL RIGHT?"
01:17:17.049,01:17:18.384,I'M AUDI.
01:17:21.887,01:17:24.014,WHAT DID I DO?
01:17:24.056,01:17:27.017,I'VE CREATED SOME SORT OF A MONSTER.
01:17:27.059,01:17:32.022,I COULD FEEL THE CHUNKS START TO RISE UP IN MY THROAT.
01:17:32.064,01:17:34.358,I HAD TO GET OUT.
01:17:44.160,01:17:47.622,EVERYTHING I THINK AND EVERYTHING I DO IS WRONG.
01:17:47.663,01:17:49.624,I WAS WRONG ABOUT ELTON.
01:17:49.665,01:17:50.916,I WAS WRONG ABOUT CHRISTIAN.
01:17:50.958,01:17:52.709,NOW JOSH HATED ME.
01:17:52.751,01:17:59.049,IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO ONE INEVITABLE CONCLUSION-- I WAS JUST TOTALLY CLUELESS.
01:17:59.091,01:18:04.054,"OH, AND THIS JOSH AND TAI THING WAS WIGGIN' ME MORE THAN ANYTHING."
01:18:04.096,01:18:06.474,WHAT WAS MY PROBLEM?
01:18:06.516,01:18:08.434,I DON'T BEGRUDGE HER A BOYFRIEND.
01:18:08.476,01:18:09.977,I REALLY--OOH!
01:18:10.019,01:18:11.979,I WONDER IF THEY HAVE THAT IN MY SIZE.
01:18:13.856,01:18:16.484,WHAT DOES SHE WANT WITH JOSH ANYWAY?
01:18:16.526,01:18:17.985,HE DRESSES FUNNY.
01:18:18.027,01:18:19.987,HE LISTENS TO COMPLAINT ROCK.
01:18:20.029,01:18:23.699,HE'S NOT EVEN CUTE...
01:18:23.740,01:18:30.623,"I MEAN, HE'S JUST LIKE THIS SLUG WHO HANGS AROUND THE HOUSE ALL THE TIME."
01:18:30.665,01:18:34.335,AND HE'S A HIDEOUS DANCER.
01:18:34.377,01:18:37.254,COULDN'T TAKE HIM ANYWHERE.
01:18:37.296,01:18:40.257,WAIT A SECOND.
01:18:40.299,01:18:42.301,"THIS IS, LIKE, JOSH."
01:18:46.389,01:18:49.350,"O.K., O.K., SO HE'S KIND OF A BALDWIN."
01:18:49.392,01:18:51.852,WHAT WOULD HE WANT WITH TAI?
01:18:51.894,01:18:53.854,SHE COULDN'T MAKE HIM HAPPY.
01:18:53.896,01:19:00.861,"JOSH NEEDS SOMEONE WITH IMAGINATION, SOMEONE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM, SOMEONE TO LAUGH AT HIS JOKES..."
01:19:00.903,01:19:03.364,IN CASE HE EVER MAKES ANY.
01:19:03.406,01:19:04.990,THEN SUDDENLY...
01:19:05.032,01:19:07.034,"OH, MY GOD."
01:19:09.036,01:19:12.122,I LOVE JOSH.
01:19:12.164,01:19:17.002,"I AM MAJORLY, TOTALLY, CRAZY IN LOVE WITH JOSH."
01:19:17.044,01:19:20.506,BUT NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT AROUND HIM.
01:19:20.548,01:19:29.515,"I MEAN, ORDINARILY, I'D STRUT AROUND HIM IN MY CUTEST LITTLE OUTFITS AND SEND MYSELF FLOWERS AND CANDY, BUT I COULDN'T DO THAT STUFF WITH JOSH."
01:19:29.557,01:19:31.016,WHAT'S WITH YOU?
01:19:31.058,01:19:32.518,WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:19:47.074,01:19:51.412,"WELL, UH, I THOUGHT THEY DECLARED PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST."
01:20:01.464,01:20:02.839,"CHER, GET IN HERE!"
01:20:02.881,01:20:04.300,"WHAT'S UP, DADDY?"
01:20:04.341,01:20:06.176,WHAT ARE YOU DOING DANCING IN FRONT OF MY OFFICE?
01:20:06.218,01:20:11.140,NOTHING. I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU NEED ANY HELP WITH ANYTHING.
01:20:11.181,01:20:13.476,"YEAH, YOU CAN HELP ME WITH SOMETHING."
01:20:13.517,01:20:14.851,COME OVER HERE.
01:20:16.520,01:20:18.439,ALL RIGHT.
01:20:18.481,01:20:25.488,"EVERY TIME THAT YOU SEE A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION THAT TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 3rd, HIGHLIGHT IT."
01:20:25.529,01:20:26.989,JUST SEPTEMBER 3rd.
01:20:27.030,01:20:28.365,O.K.
01:20:32.035,01:20:33.996,"IT'S FUN, HUH?"

01:20:38.834,01:20:43.673,"DADDY, DID YOU EVER HAVE A PROBLEM THAT YOU COULDN'T ARGUE YOUR WAY OUT OF?"
01:20:43.714,01:20:46.425,"TELL ME THE PROBLEM, AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO ARGUE IT."
01:20:46.467,01:20:50.471,"I LIKE THIS BOY, AND HE LIKES SOMEONE ELSE."
01:20:50.513,01:20:52.181,HOW COULD THAT BE?
01:20:52.222,01:20:54.517,I DON'T KNOW.
01:20:54.558,01:20:56.393,"OBVIOUSLY, THIS BOY IS A COMPLETE MORON."
01:20:56.435,01:21:00.731,YOU ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN BEVERLY HILLS.
01:21:00.773,01:21:06.529,"AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M NOT SURE I WANT YOU WITH A STUPID FELLOW."
01:21:06.570,01:21:09.031,"WELL, ACTUALLY, HE IS A SMART GUY."
01:21:09.072,01:21:11.534,HE'S ONE OF THOSE DO-GOODER TYPES.
01:21:11.575,01:21:14.662,I FEEL LIKE MY AFTER-SCHOOL COMMITMENTS AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.
01:21:14.704,01:21:16.539,HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
01:21:16.580,01:21:19.041,WHO TAKES CARE OF EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD?
01:21:19.082,01:21:21.544,WHO MAKES SURE THAT DADDY EATS RIGHT?
01:21:21.585,01:21:25.840,I HAVE NOT SEEN SUCH GOOD-DOING SINCE YOUR MOTHER.
01:21:25.881,01:21:27.049,REALLY?
01:21:27.090,01:21:30.302,REALLY.
01:21:30.344,01:21:32.388,"NOW, GET BACK TO WORK."
01:21:36.933,01:21:46.985,"LATER, WHILE WE WERE LEARNING ABOUT THE PISMO BEACH DISASTER, I DECIDED I NEEDED A COMPLETE MAKEOVER, EXCEPT THIS TIME, I'D MAKEOVER MY SOUL."
01:21:47.027,01:21:49.572,BUT WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY A BETTER PERSON?
01:21:49.613,01:21:54.076,THEN I REALIZED ALL MY FRIENDS WERE GOOD IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
01:21:54.117,01:21:57.954,"LIKE CHRISTIAN, HE ALWAYS WANTS THINGS TO BE BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING."
01:21:57.996,01:22:03.419,"OR DIONNE AND MURRAY, WHEN THEY THINK NO ONE IS WATCHING, ARE SO CONSIDERATE OF EACH OTHER."
01:22:03.460,01:22:10.300,"AND POOR MISS GEIST, ALWAYS TRYING TO GET US INVOLVED NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE RESIST."
01:22:10.342,01:22:19.769,"OH. THAT'S JUST-- THAT DOESN'T EVEN SHOW-- EVERY SINGLE POSSESSION, EVERY MEMORY, EVERYTHING YOU'VE HAD YOUR WHOLE LIFE GONE IN A SECOND."
01:22:19.810,01:22:22.521,CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT MUST FEEL LIKE?
01:22:22.563,01:22:24.022,ELTON?
01:22:24.064,01:22:26.024,CAN I USE THE PASS?

01:23:09.735,01:23:11.361,I DON'T THINK THEY NEED YOUR SKIS.
01:23:11.403,01:23:14.030,"DADDY, SOME PEOPLE LOST ALL THEIR BELONGINGS."
01:23:14.072,01:23:16.408,DON'T YOU THINK THAT INCLUDES ATHLETIC EQUIPMENT?
01:23:16.450,01:23:19.244,"THIS IS YOUR INFLUENCE, JOSH?"
01:23:40.891,01:23:42.058,...REALLY FUN.
01:23:44.353,01:23:45.813,IT'S SO PRETTY.

01:27:46.053,01:27:48.055,"WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?"
01:27:48.097,01:27:50.306,SHE DIDN'T MEAN ANY HARM.
01:27:50.348,01:27:51.641,I'LL GET KILLED 'CAUSE SHE'S A MORON.
01:27:51.683,01:27:52.851,SHE'S NOT A MORON.
01:27:52.893,01:27:55.938,"IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION, IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED."
01:27:55.979,01:27:59.149,"IF YOU HADN'T HAVE BEEN PLAYING FOOTSIE, SHE WOULDN'T BE BOTHERING ME."
01:27:59.191,01:28:02.027,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
01:28:02.069,01:28:06.489,"THIS IS A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR LAWSUIT, NOT SOME EXCUSE FOR PUPPY LOVE."
01:28:06.531,01:28:08.992,WE'VE WORKED OUR BUTTS OFF ON THIS CASE!
01:28:09.034,01:28:10.786,DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH YOUR BUTTS.

01:28:27.385,01:28:29.512,"WELL, DID I SET HIM BACK?"
01:28:29.554,01:28:34.517,"I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE, AND HE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THAT TIME."
01:28:34.559,01:28:37.020,DON'T WORRY.
01:28:37.062,01:28:39.189,YOUR FATHER WON'T LOSE ANY TIME.
01:28:39.231,01:28:42.192,CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NERVE OF THAT GUY?
01:28:42.234,01:28:45.528,"I MEAN, MAKING YOU WORRY LIKE THAT."
01:28:45.570,01:28:48.073,HE'S THE ONE THAT SCREWED UP.
01:28:48.115,01:28:50.117,THEN HE GOES AND BLAMES US.

01:29:05.007,01:29:08.969,"BUT YOU, I MEAN, YOU DON'T NEED TO BE DOING THIS."
01:29:09.011,01:29:12.097,GO OUT AND HAVE FUN.
01:29:14.016,01:29:15.976,YOU THINK THAT'S ALL I DO?
01:29:16.018,01:29:18.478,I'M JUST A DITZ WITH A CREDIT CARD?
01:29:18.520,01:29:19.521,"NO, NO."
01:29:19.562,01:29:21.982,THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

01:29:54.056,01:29:56.516,BUT THIS IS NOT WHY I COME HERE.
01:29:56.558,01:30:00.312,THIS IS A GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME.
01:30:00.354,01:30:03.606,YOU ALREADY SAID THAT.
01:30:03.648,01:30:06.484,MEL. I WANT TO HELP OUT MEL.
01:30:06.526,01:30:09.071,HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO CARES ABOUT ME.
01:30:09.112,01:30:11.698,THAT'S NOT TRUE.
01:30:11.740,01:30:13.575,HE'S NOT?
01:30:13.616,01:30:16.161,NO.
