00:44:03.040,00:44:05.376,I'm not saying anything.
01:00:38.301,01:00:40.937,"Where is Heinrich, brother?"
01:00:41.738,01:00:45.308,Sooner or later he'll be coming for you.
01:00:45.642,01:00:46.709,Brother.
01:01:10.867,01:01:14.137,I'm sorry about Jonas.
01:22:18.600,01:22:20.468,"Drive, you idiot!"
00:00:43.293,00:00:45.086,MAN: All eyes are up.
00:00:45.128,00:00:46.338,MAN 2: Sat cams are good.
00:00:46.380,00:00:48.465,Target is inbound.
00:00:48.507,00:00:50.300,ETA: five minutes.
00:00:50.342,00:00:51.760,Mission is a go.
00:00:51.802,00:00:53.303,Repeat-- you are green to go.
00:00:53.345,00:00:56.932,Intercept and apprehend the Heinrich brothers.
00:00:56.974,00:00:58.559,Secure the device.
00:00:58.600,00:01:02.855,"And remember, this mission is covert."
00:01:09.194,00:01:11.405,I've got some action.
00:01:11.446,00:01:13.156,WOMAN: Hi. My name is Xenia.
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.533,Pleased to meet you.
00:01:14.575,00:01:15.534,FDR.
00:01:15.576,00:01:18.037,So what brings you to Hong Kong?
00:01:18.161,00:01:18.996,Business or pleasure?
00:01:19.038,00:01:20.039,Pleasure.
00:01:20.163,00:01:21.498,A little bit of both.
00:01:21.540,00:01:22.583,What kind of business are you in?
00:01:22.624,00:01:26.169,I am a cruise ship captain of a very large vessel.
00:01:26.169,00:01:28.839,My small friend here is a kick-ass travel agent.
00:01:30.173,00:01:32.342,"Permission to come aboard, Captain?"
00:01:33.844,00:01:35.554,"And on that note, will you excuse us, please, ladies?"
00:01:35.596,00:01:37.806,Because we do actually have some work to do.
00:01:37.848,00:01:39.975,"Yes, we do."
00:01:43.353,00:01:45.022,"Yes, we do."
00:01:55.198,00:01:56.784,That's a lovely suit.
00:01:56.825,00:01:59.202,"Well, it is Savile Row's finest."
00:02:15.427,00:02:19.014,MAN: I see you brought your baby brother to protect you.
00:02:19.306,00:02:20.975,What did you say?
00:02:23.310,00:02:24.436,Let's go Jonas.
00:02:27.230,00:02:29.399,Shots fired. Men down.
00:02:34.488,00:02:35.864,All right.
00:02:35.906,00:02:37.240,Here we go.
00:02:58.345,00:02:59.513,Mag!
00:02:59.554,00:03:01.264,I need a mag!
00:03:33.505,00:03:34.381,Shoot him.
00:03:51.523,00:03:52.649,Tuck!
00:04:03.744,00:04:05.537,Jonas!
00:04:13.545,00:04:16.173,Whoa!
00:04:47.871,00:04:50.540,Heinrich is not going to be happy.
00:04:50.582,00:04:52.251,I'm more concerned about the boss.
00:04:52.375,00:04:53.376,Definitely.
00:04:53.376,00:04:55.879,"Hey, you think those girls are still here?"
00:05:07.224,00:05:09.268,Here we go.
00:05:09.392,00:05:12.271,So the Coretex has minimal damage.
00:05:12.395,00:05:14.397,There's just some calcining around the edges.
00:05:14.397,00:05:19.402,"However, the Tempolite has significant damage, and there's rusting around 300 degrees."
00:05:19.402,00:05:21.989,So that means the Coretex gets the recommend.
00:05:22.030,00:05:24.158,"See, Em?"
00:05:24.199,00:05:25.951,The best product always wins.
00:05:25.993,00:05:27.410,"Ooh, Lauren?"
00:05:27.410,00:05:31.957,"Uh, I was just wondering if I might skip out a little bit early for the holiday weekend."
00:05:31.999,00:05:36.170,"Jerry's taking me Oh, yeah, of course."
00:05:36.211,00:05:37.629,It's a holiday.
00:05:37.671,00:05:39.173,And a weekend.
00:05:39.214,00:05:41.466,"Yeah, so you should do that."
00:05:41.508,00:05:42.467,Okay.
00:05:42.509,00:05:43.593,Have fun.
00:05:43.635,00:05:44.636,"You have fun, too."
00:05:44.678,00:05:46.721,I will.
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.437,Tuck! FDR!
00:05:56.523,00:05:59.484,Six men in the morgue.
00:05:59.526,00:06:01.611,A body in the middle of the street.
00:06:01.653,00:06:05.240,"Yes, but to be fair, we did manage to, uh..."
00:06:05.282,00:06:06.574,Shut up.
00:06:06.616,00:06:08.869,"Uh, that's me shutting up right now."
00:06:10.120,00:06:15.876,The mission parameters of the Heinrich case were clearly indicated to be covert.
00:06:15.917,00:06:21.506,"Thanks to you two geniuses, Heinrich will be seeking revenge for his brother's death."
00:06:21.548,00:06:23.050,You guys are grounded.
00:06:23.091,00:06:25.468,What?
00:06:44.487,00:06:45.906,"Hey, Lauren."
00:06:45.947,00:06:47.741,"Lauren! Hey, hey."
00:06:47.782,00:06:50.035,"Hi, Steve. Hey."
00:06:50.077,00:06:53.496,Hey.
00:06:54.373,00:06:55.665,"Yeah. Oh, my... I'm so sorry."
00:06:55.707,00:06:57.251,"Uh, Lauren, this is Kelly."
00:06:57.292,00:06:58.501,Hi. Hi.
00:06:58.501,00:07:00.087,It's very nice to meet you.
00:07:00.128,00:07:01.713,"Nice to meet you, too. Yeah."
00:07:03.131,00:07:04.507,What a big rock.
00:07:04.507,00:07:06.385,"My fiancée. Yes, yeah."
00:07:06.509,00:07:08.345,You are engaged.
00:07:08.387,00:07:10.764,Yeah.
00:07:10.805,00:07:13.767,"Things just worked out exactly how they're supposed to, didn't they?"
00:07:13.808,00:07:16.061,Yeah. Yeah.
00:07:16.103,00:07:17.520,Yes.
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.689,Looks cool.
00:07:19.731,00:07:21.524,"Okay, well, you know what?"
00:07:21.524,00:07:26.113,I'm going to go because I'm going to go meet my guy... Ken.
00:07:26.154,00:07:27.281,Huh.
00:07:27.322,00:07:28.573,"Um, he's a surgeon."
00:07:28.615,00:07:30.533,Wow.
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.535,"Well, um, congratulations on your ring..."
00:07:32.535,00:07:33.536,"Oh, thanks."
00:07:33.536,00:07:36.915,...and your life and your bikes and everything.
00:07:36.957,00:07:38.541,Yeah.
00:07:38.541,00:07:39.751,"Okay. Well, peace."
00:07:39.793,00:07:40.877,See you.
00:07:40.919,00:07:42.879,Okay.
00:07:42.921,00:07:44.547,"I just said, Peace."
00:07:44.547,00:07:46.716,I want to die right now.
00:07:50.553,00:07:52.555,Sushi for one!
00:07:55.725,00:07:56.977,"Hey, Ken."
00:07:58.561,00:07:59.562,The usual?
00:07:59.562,00:08:01.564,Yeah.
00:08:03.233,00:08:04.734,"Long day, huh?"
00:08:04.776,00:08:06.903,You don't know the half of it.
00:08:06.945,00:08:08.780,Ugh.
00:08:11.783,00:08:13.994,This is too funny.
00:08:16.413,00:08:17.831,Hysterical.
00:08:17.872,00:08:19.582,I'm sorry. This is supposed to be your boyfriend's seat.
00:08:19.582,00:08:20.834,"Uh, Ken, right?"
00:08:20.875,00:08:23.128,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:23.170,00:08:24.796,Sushi for one.
00:08:24.838,00:08:27.590,Yeah. Always for one.
00:08:29.592,00:08:32.595,"Oh, it was the most humiliating moment ever."
00:08:32.595,00:08:35.598,"Well, that's because you have to come up with, like, better excuses."
00:08:35.598,00:08:43.023,"You should have been like, I have a fiancé, too, but he's actually getting a penile reduction this afternoon, because his penis is so big, every time, it lands like a poltergeist."
00:08:43.064,00:08:44.607,I can't think of anything when I see him.
00:08:44.607,00:08:47.610,I just can't believe I gave up everything for him.
00:08:47.610,00:08:49.029,It's just...
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.655,"I left my friends, my family."
00:08:50.697,00:08:52.949,Don't say that. I'm happy that you moved out here.
00:08:52.991,00:08:54.617,We have a happy life together.
00:08:54.617,00:08:55.869,I just thought he was my person.
00:08:55.910,00:08:59.164,"Well, I thought he was your person, too, but you know what kind of person he ended up being?"
00:08:59.206,00:09:02.792,The kind of person that ends up with a girl that likes to make out after she eats yellowtail.
00:09:02.834,00:09:04.044,I like sushi.
00:09:04.085,00:09:05.170,She seemed really nice.
00:09:05.212,00:09:06.463,She was really pretty.
00:09:06.505,00:09:08.382,"Well, I don't give a shit about her."
00:09:08.423,00:09:11.510,I give a shit about you and your love life.
00:09:11.634,00:09:13.303,I'm going out. I'm dating.
00:09:13.345,00:09:14.846,"Oh, please, you're not..."
00:09:13.345,00:09:16.639,"you date, but you're not taking it seriously."
00:09:16.639,00:09:18.641,"Uh, don't use that brand."
00:09:18.641,00:09:19.851,That one's much more effective.
00:09:19.893,00:09:21.853,"Well, I wish you would act like that with men."
00:09:21.895,00:09:26.191,"I mean, you can choose a laundry detergent, but you can't choose some guy that you want to have penetr..."
00:09:26.233,00:09:28.068,That's my job. It's easier.
00:09:28.109,00:09:29.652,There's charts. There's numbers.
00:09:29.652,00:09:31.321,"Well, that's why you should start online dating."
00:09:31.363,00:09:33.114,They have lots of charts.
00:09:33.156,00:09:34.657,What is your problem with online dating?
00:09:34.657,00:09:35.909,What's my problem?
00:09:35.950,00:09:37.118,Do you watch Dateline?
00:09:37.160,00:09:39.204,Do you know how many creeps are out there?
00:09:39.246,00:09:41.664,I could end up a skin suit or in somebody's trunk.
00:09:41.664,00:09:43.208,"Uh, that's a little dramatic, okay?"
00:09:43.250,00:09:47.254,"That happens to, like, one in 20 girls, and you're not going to end up in anybody's trunk."
00:09:47.295,00:09:49.423,"If you're lucky, somebody will end up in your trunk."
00:09:49.464,00:09:50.507,That's your trunk.
00:09:50.549,00:09:52.092,Get out of here. Stop.
00:09:52.133,00:09:54.344,"Point is that you need to get back out there, okay?"
00:09:54.386,00:10:01.268,"Because, yeah, sure, you might make a mistake and end up with the wrong guy, but you might end up meeting the right guy, so isn't that worth it?"
00:10:01.309,00:10:03.644,"I mean, really, what is the worst thing that could happen?"
00:10:03.686,00:10:04.896,Skin suit.
00:10:04.938,00:10:07.107,Skin suit's pretty bad.
00:10:10.985,00:10:13.572,TUCK: Thank you for having me over to your nana's today.
00:10:13.613,00:10:14.655,FDR: Are you kidding me?
00:10:14.697,00:10:16.324,You're my best friend.
00:10:16.366,00:10:18.159,"Oh, my God."
00:10:18.201,00:10:19.953,This is gluten-free.
00:10:19.994,00:10:21.455,Try a taste.
00:10:19.994,00:10:23.664,Why the heck are you two sitting over here all by yourselves?
00:10:23.706,00:10:27.127,You're not going to make me any great-grandbabies this way.
00:10:27.168,00:10:28.669,"It is a family gathering, Nana."
00:10:28.711,00:10:31.465,I don't think you want us making any great-grandbabies today.
00:10:31.506,00:10:35.676,"To be fair, I have already provided you with a wonderful great-grandchild."
00:10:35.718,00:10:38.679,"Yeah, but that doesn't count, because you screwed it all up."
00:10:38.721,00:10:40.348,Ouch.
00:10:40.390,00:10:41.975,"MAN: Come on, Lil."
00:10:42.016,00:10:43.518,Mmm.
00:10:43.560,00:10:46.146,"MAN: Let's show these kids how it's done, huh?"
00:10:47.522,00:10:49.608,Ciao.
00:10:51.526,00:10:53.487,It's kind of gross when they kiss.
00:10:58.408,00:10:59.700,"FDR: God, I love that kid."
00:10:59.742,00:11:01.369,MAN: Whoa!
00:11:02.370,00:11:04.498,What's going on?
00:11:04.539,00:11:05.748,"Hey, Mr. Deep In Thought."
00:11:05.748,00:11:07.750,Hmm?
00:11:07.750,00:11:08.751,"Oh, just-just..."
00:11:08.751,00:11:10.211,"that kind of thing's lovely, isn't it?"
00:11:10.253,00:11:11.505,It's really lovely.
00:11:11.546,00:11:13.381,What's lovely?
00:11:11.546,00:11:15.509,The way... I love the way that they look into each other's eyes like that.
00:11:15.550,00:11:17.760,I'm pretty sure that's the cataracts.
00:11:17.760,00:11:21.764,"You... okay, but you asked me a serious question, didn't you? Yeah?"
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.766,"Right, so what, you want a..."
00:11:23.808,00:11:25.143,Yeah. You want me to put the cake down?
00:11:25.185,00:11:26.102,"Yes, please."
00:11:26.144,00:11:28.771,Thank you.
00:11:28.771,00:11:30.357,Talk to me.
00:11:30.398,00:11:31.774,Okay?
00:11:31.774,00:11:32.775,Man to man.
00:11:32.775,00:11:34.444,I trust you.
00:11:34.486,00:11:35.820,I know you'd do anything for me.
00:11:35.862,00:11:37.238,Yeah.
00:11:35.862,00:11:39.366,I know that you would take a bullet for me.
00:11:39.407,00:11:40.783,You know that. Right?
00:11:40.783,00:11:44.120,Can you imagine all of that...
00:11:44.162,00:11:45.372,Yes.
00:11:45.413,00:11:51.794,Can you imagine what that would be like to share with a woman?
00:11:51.794,00:11:53.004,No.
00:11:53.046,00:11:54.381,Okay.
00:11:54.422,00:11:55.798,No.
00:11:55.798,00:11:57.509,Thank you.
00:12:15.276,00:12:17.945,"MAN: All right, Joe, Steven, you're up."
00:12:18.988,00:12:19.989,"TUCK: All right, Joe, good luck, son."
00:12:20.031,00:12:21.575,Let's go to war!
00:12:21.616,00:12:22.825,That's it.
00:12:22.825,00:12:23.826,Now you fake.
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.453,Nice fake.
00:12:25.495,00:12:26.829,"Get on him. Oh, boom!"
00:12:26.829,00:12:28.831,Down he goes!
00:12:28.831,00:12:31.167,Get on him! Ground-and-pound!
00:12:31.209,00:12:33.670,Uh...
00:12:33.712,00:12:35.380,Hammerfist!
00:12:35.422,00:12:37.298,He's giving you his back.
00:12:37.340,00:12:39.842,JOE: I give! I give!
00:12:39.842,00:12:41.720,He's out! Boo-yah!
00:12:41.844,00:12:43.263,See what I mean?
00:12:43.304,00:12:44.847,"That's how it works, boy!"
00:12:44.847,00:12:46.725,"I pwned him, didn't I?"
00:12:46.849,00:12:48.851,TUCK: Good. You're okay.
00:12:48.851,00:12:51.020,That's how you kill.
00:12:51.062,00:12:52.855,What are you doing here in the middle of the day?
00:12:52.897,00:12:56.859,"Well, I had a bit of time off, and I thought that I'd come hang with my homey."
00:12:56.859,00:12:57.902,I got creamed.
00:12:57.944,00:12:59.487,"No, you didn't get creamed."
00:12:59.529,00:13:01.030,That's just a matter of opinion.
00:13:01.072,00:13:02.865,What do you know about fighting?
00:13:02.865,00:13:04.743,You're just a travel agent.
00:13:04.867,00:13:09.247,I-I know enough to know that he who hesitates...
00:13:12.875,00:13:15.044,Pain?
00:13:15.086,00:13:19.591,That's just weakness leaving the body.
00:13:23.886,00:13:25.472,"Oh, Dad."
00:13:25.513,00:13:27.098,MAN: Put a lock on that.
00:13:27.140,00:13:28.891,Joe. Joe. Joe.
00:13:32.520,00:13:33.938,"Hey, guys."
00:13:33.980,00:13:36.023,Hey.
00:13:36.065,00:13:38.025,"Hey, bud."

00:13:39.778,00:13:40.903,Hey. How you doing?
00:13:40.945,00:13:43.030,Didn't know you were in town.
00:13:40.945,00:13:44.574,"I got a couple of days off from the agency, so I thought I'd come see Joe."
00:13:44.616,00:13:48.369,You're still the only travel agent I've ever met who actually travels for his job.
00:13:48.411,00:13:49.912,Yeah.
00:13:50.913,00:13:53.958,"Um, so I-I was thinking that maybe, um..."
00:13:54.000,00:14:02.342,"uh, maybe you, me and Joe, we could all go out together, you know, as a family and maybe get something to eat, have a meal."
00:14:02.383,00:14:04.385,"I think that would be really, really good."
00:14:04.427,00:14:05.928,"I have a date tonight, Tuck."
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.515,So maybe some other time.
00:14:08.556,00:14:10.350,Sure. That's great.
00:14:10.391,00:14:11.476,Good. That's good.

00:15:26.426,00:15:28.636,What? Nothing.
00:15:30.847,00:15:31.848,"Good morning, Hudson."

00:15:52.034,00:15:53.160,Hi.
00:15:53.202,00:15:55.037,Bi-curious? Skinny-dipping?
00:15:55.037,00:15:56.038,Rollerblading?
00:15:56.038,00:15:58.040,"I mean, what is this, 1994?"
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.292,You looked adorable in those dolphin shorts.
00:15:59.333,00:16:01.085,And men are gonna respond to that camel toe.
00:16:01.127,00:16:02.921,"I'm gonna kill you, Trish."
00:16:03.045,00:16:04.255,"Uh, how about thank you?"
00:16:04.297,00:16:08.050,My entire office thinks I clean my house in a naughty nurse costume.
00:16:08.050,00:16:09.886,"That's fine. That means you're open to role-playing, okay?"
00:16:09.928,00:16:11.471,We're trying to cast a very wide net here.
00:16:11.512,00:16:13.180,We don't know what kind of guys you like yet.
00:16:13.222,00:16:16.100,"You've got me here in a keg stand, looking for a serious relationship."
00:16:16.142,00:16:18.060,I don't even know what that means.
00:16:18.060,00:16:19.061,It means that you're flexible.
00:16:19.061,00:16:21.940,Guys want to know that you're flexible and that you're good at gymnastics.
00:16:22.064,00:16:23.858,"No, no, no, that's Mommy's special milk, okay?"
00:16:23.900,00:16:25.443,Just get me off this thing.
00:16:25.485,00:16:27.278,You're not canceling it.
00:16:27.320,00:16:28.863,"I'm in charge of that, and you're not canceling it."
00:16:28.905,00:16:30.490,Sorry.
00:16:30.531,00:16:32.074,Who is that?
00:16:33.451,00:16:35.703,"Oh, my God. He's cute."
00:16:35.745,00:16:37.079,Let me get this straight.
00:16:37.079,00:16:40.875,"You put your personal, private details on a very public Web site?"
00:16:40.917,00:16:42.084,Yes.
00:16:42.126,00:16:44.128,No.
00:16:44.170,00:16:45.964,Don't do that to me.
00:16:47.381,00:16:48.549,I like the jukebox.
00:16:48.591,00:16:50.092,"Man, you're such a cheese ball."
00:16:50.092,00:16:51.427,"Look, here's how it's gonna go down."
00:16:51.469,00:16:53.554,"You're gonna go on this date, and I'm gonna go on the date with you."
00:16:53.596,00:16:54.889,"No, you're not."
00:16:54.931,00:16:56.098,"I'm scared for you, man."
00:16:56.098,00:16:57.558,You haven't done this in a long time.
00:16:57.600,00:16:59.352,This girl could be all sorts of crazy.
00:16:59.393,00:17:02.104,"And, besides, half those girls pee standing up, Tuck."
00:17:02.104,00:17:04.273,The other half are on one of our watch lists.
00:17:05.316,00:17:06.651,It's a date.
00:17:06.693,00:17:08.152,"Look, lucky for you, I'm free tonight."
00:17:08.194,00:17:13.115,"And I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring the binoculars, I'm gonna bring the hand cream, keep a hundred-yard radius, it'll be sweet stuff."
00:17:13.115,00:17:15.117,"No, you can't bring the binoculars."
00:17:15.117,00:17:17.119,You're not watching my date.
00:17:17.119,00:17:18.245,"No, it's wrong."
00:17:18.287,00:17:19.789,"You know what, I'll be around the corner on ringtone."
00:17:19.831,00:17:21.749,I'll be at the video store.
00:17:21.791,00:17:25.962,"One ring means you need an extraction, two means you need a cleaner, three means I can get home."
00:17:26.004,00:17:28.130,200 yards.
00:17:28.130,00:17:29.131,Sold!
00:17:36.138,00:17:37.724,Tuck?
00:17:37.765,00:17:40.685,Are you Tuck?
00:17:40.727,00:17:42.603,Hi.
00:17:42.645,00:17:44.146,I'm Lauren.
00:17:44.146,00:17:45.189,Gosh. Hello.
00:17:45.231,00:17:46.774,Very nice to meet you.
00:17:46.816,00:17:49.193,"You, too. Um..."
00:17:49.235,00:17:51.153,"Please, sit."
00:17:51.195,00:17:53.197,"Please, sorry, um, yeah."
00:17:55.950,00:17:58.912,"Wow. It's like-- You are really, really beautiful."
00:17:58.953,00:18:00.371,Could you say that a few more times?
00:18:00.413,00:18:01.372,'Cause your voice is amazing.
00:18:03.249,00:18:07.420,I feel like I need to apologize again for that bizarre profile.
00:18:07.461,00:18:08.379,"No. No, no, no, no."
00:18:08.421,00:18:09.505,My friend Trish is...
00:18:09.547,00:18:10.924,"Oh, no, don't be, don't be silly."
00:18:10.965,00:18:12.174,I think everybody should have a friend who's a spaz.
00:18:12.216,00:18:14.510,I think I'm going to have to kill her.
00:18:14.552,00:18:17.179,"Well, actually, I might be able to help you with that."
00:18:17.179,00:18:18.389,I'm kidding.
00:18:18.431,00:18:20.516,So am I.
00:18:20.558,00:18:23.853,Love is the only thing that can save this poor creature.
00:18:23.895,00:18:30.818,"And I am going to convince him that he is loved, even at the cost of my own life."
00:18:30.860,00:18:35.239,"No matter what you hear in there, no matter how cruelly I beg you..."
00:18:35.281,00:18:36.198,Hi.
00:18:44.206,00:18:45.750,"Good for you, pal."
00:18:45.792,00:18:49.211,So tell me one thing that's not on your profile.
00:18:49.211,00:18:52.214,Um... I have a son.
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.257,"Oh, you do?"
00:18:53.299,00:18:54.884,He's called Joe.
00:18:54.926,00:18:58.638,"He's seven, and he's really lovely, really lovely."
00:18:58.679,00:19:00.056,And his mom?
00:19:00.098,00:19:02.516,Couldn't work.
00:19:03.517,00:19:05.103,How about you?
00:19:05.227,00:19:07.229,No kids that I know of.
00:19:07.229,00:19:08.230,Okay.
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.232,And no ex-wives.
00:19:10.232,00:19:12.234,I have a very important question to ask you.
00:19:12.234,00:19:13.611,Good. Go on.
00:19:13.653,00:19:16.489,Have you ever been or do you ever plan on being a serial killer?
00:19:16.530,00:19:19.617,"Mm, well, I mean, you got to keep your options open."
00:19:19.659,00:19:21.368,But no.
00:19:21.410,00:19:22.620,Good answer.
00:19:24.831,00:19:26.624,So you've never killed anybody with your bare hands?
00:19:26.666,00:19:29.585,Not this week.
00:19:29.627,00:19:31.253,Great.
00:19:31.253,00:19:32.630,"Lauren, you're incredible."
00:19:32.672,00:19:34.256,You're not so bad yourself.
00:19:34.298,00:19:40.138,"All right, I'm gonna go and rent a movie and take a cold shower..."
00:19:40.262,00:19:41.263,"I will, too."
00:19:41.263,00:19:43.390,"Okay, and wait for your call, for the next..."
00:19:43.432,00:19:44.308,Five minutes.
00:19:46.352,00:19:48.270,This is where it all started.
00:19:48.270,00:19:51.107,"Yes, I was standing over there by that desk."
00:19:51.149,00:19:52.608,"WOMAN: No, you were sitting in the chair."
00:19:52.650,00:19:55.277,And suddenly you started walking toward me.
00:19:55.277,00:19:57.279,"Very slowly, very slowly."
00:19:57.279,00:19:59.157,I could count every step.
00:19:59.281,00:20:03.661,"And when you were walking toward me so very slowly, I thought, what's the matter with him? Can't he walk faster?"
00:20:03.703,00:20:05.245,And then I ran out...
00:20:05.287,00:20:06.246,Oh.
00:20:06.288,00:20:07.540,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:20:07.581,00:20:08.916,"No, no, no, that's okay."
00:20:08.958,00:20:10.543,You take it.
00:20:10.584,00:20:11.878,You know what?
00:20:11.919,00:20:14.254,"Uh, it's got a twist ending; you'll see it coming from a mile away."
00:20:14.296,00:20:16.174,And how would you know what I like?
00:20:16.215,00:20:17.842,I know movies.
00:20:17.884,00:20:19.259,And women.
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.928,Really?
00:20:20.970,00:20:22.138,Mm-hmm.
00:20:22.180,00:20:24.682,Okay.
00:20:24.724,00:20:26.976,"Well, then why don't you tell me what I want."
00:20:28.686,00:20:31.147,The Lady Vanishes?
00:20:31.189,00:20:32.356,Mm-hmm.
00:20:32.398,00:20:34.859,"Well, firstly, you can never go wrong with Hitchcock, ever."
00:20:34.901,00:20:38.278,"It's got comedy, drama, romance, it's a thriller."
00:20:38.320,00:20:39.780,"It's classy, but not stuffy."
00:20:39.822,00:20:44.368,"And it's a little obscure, so if you haven't seen it, you'll thank me for introducing you to it."
00:20:44.410,00:20:48.164,"If you have, you'll know what a good choice it was."
00:20:48.206,00:20:50.290,"Well, I have seen it."
00:20:50.332,00:20:52.292,Mm-hmm.
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.586,Mm.
00:20:53.627,00:21:00.300,"However, not as good as Rebecca, Notorious, Vertigo or pretty much any of his films from 1960 to 1972."
00:21:00.342,00:21:04.222,"In fact, it's sort of..."
00:21:04.346,00:21:05.556,Second...
00:21:05.598,00:21:07.558,"You know what, scratch this..."
00:21:07.600,00:21:09.518,"Look, I see you surveying the prospects."
00:21:09.560,00:21:11.353,That one over there in Foreign?
00:21:11.353,00:21:12.730,Too much angst.
00:21:12.772,00:21:15.566,"This one, over here in the sweater set, picking out animated movies?"
00:21:15.608,00:21:17.735,That girl will have your children named before breakfast.
00:21:17.777,00:21:20.821,The problem is no one here looks like a clean getaway.
00:21:20.863,00:21:22.031,I get it.
00:21:22.073,00:21:24.366,You come in here looking for a girl renting a movie.
00:21:24.366,00:21:26.244,"Clearly, she doesn't have a date for the night."
00:21:26.368,00:21:27.369,We're easy targets.
00:21:27.411,00:21:31.540,"And you look like the kind of guy who's interested in a one-day rental, if you know what I mean."
00:21:31.582,00:21:32.959,That's...
00:21:31.582,00:21:38.214,"But if you knew anything about women, or anything about me, you know that I'm perfectly capable of choosing my own movies."
00:21:38.256,00:21:39.799,But thanks.
00:21:39.840,00:21:42.009,Happy hunting.
00:21:44.386,00:21:46.180,Mm.
00:21:47.807,00:21:51.185,"So, sir, you want me to hack into a video store database?"
00:21:51.227,00:21:52.394,FDR: It's for the Heinrich case.
00:21:52.394,00:21:54.230,COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Searching database.
00:21:55.439,00:21:58.776,"All right, keep on scrolling."
00:21:58.818,00:22:00.402,Wait. Stop.
00:22:01.237,00:22:02.613,That's her.
00:22:04.406,00:22:07.409,"Sir, how is this girl connected to Heinrich?"
00:22:07.409,00:22:09.787,That's G-4 classified.
00:22:09.829,00:22:12.414,"Hello, everybody, I'm Lauren Scott."
00:22:12.414,00:22:14.458,Thank you so much for being here today.
00:22:14.500,00:22:16.418,"GROUP: Good morning, Lauren."
00:22:16.460,00:22:18.420,We're here today to talk about grills.
00:22:18.462,00:22:21.174,Does anybody have any first impressions?
00:22:21.215,00:22:22.424,I liked the rotisserie feature.
00:22:22.424,00:22:23.968,Perfect. That's very helpful.
00:22:24.010,00:22:26.179,FDR: I don't think it heated up fast enough.
00:22:26.220,00:22:30.766,"Like something was wrong with the motor, maybe the spark was dead."
00:22:30.808,00:22:33.560,"Actually, sir, there's nothing wrong with the spark."
00:22:33.602,00:22:37.439,Some people think grills just burst into flames at the slightest touch.
00:22:37.481,00:22:39.150,It doesn't work like that.
00:22:40.318,00:22:42.444,Does anybody have any useful opinions?
00:22:42.444,00:22:44.446,I thought the lid was hard to handle.
00:22:44.446,00:22:45.447,Mm-hmm.
00:22:45.447,00:22:47.908,"Ugh, the lids!"
00:22:47.950,00:22:53.455,"I just felt the whole thing to be a bit stiff, uptight, not really user-friendly."
00:22:53.497,00:22:54.790,I think it depends on the user.
00:22:54.832,00:22:55.666,Hmm.
00:22:55.708,00:22:59.295,"Well, it just so happens, I have a lot of experience with grills."
00:22:59.337,00:23:01.505,I'm something of a... a grill master.
00:23:01.547,00:23:03.799,"Uh, this is a very sophisticated grill."
00:23:03.841,00:23:06.468,I'm not sure you've dealt with one of those before.
00:23:06.468,00:23:13.475,"Or maybe a grill like this is just so scared of being burned, it stays on simmer and never really heats up all the way."
00:23:13.517,00:23:14.476,Don't touch my grill.
00:23:14.518,00:23:17.230,I don't think a grill like this can handle a guy like me.
00:23:17.271,00:23:18.480,I think it could.
00:23:18.480,00:23:20.482,Easily.
00:23:18.480,00:23:22.484,"Prove it. 8:00 p.m., Barcelona, tomorrow."
00:23:22.484,00:23:26.488,"All right, I guess I could stick around a little longer, talk about grills."
00:23:26.488,00:23:28.949,"Charcoal or gas, everyone, number 19, what do you think?"
00:23:28.991,00:23:30.492,"If I say yes, will you leave?"
00:23:30.492,00:23:31.493,This is my job.
00:23:31.493,00:23:33.495,"8:00 p.m., tomorrow."
00:23:33.537,00:23:37.333,Fine.
00:23:40.753,00:23:43.756,You smell nice.
00:23:43.797,00:23:45.507,FDR: Bye.
00:23:52.514,00:23:54.683,What were you doing on the computer?
00:23:54.725,00:23:55.768,Porn?
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.644,I have a photograph of my girl.
00:23:57.686,00:23:58.771,"Dude, I was doing the same thing."
00:23:58.812,00:23:59.897,I was doing a background check on my girl.
00:23:59.939,00:24:02.149,"I don't know if that's creepy or romantic, man."
00:24:02.191,00:24:03.276,It's cromantic.
00:24:03.317,00:24:04.526,I do it all the time.
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.528,"Yeah, sure."
00:24:06.528,00:24:08.530,I'll bet yours has got antlers and howls at the moon.
00:24:08.572,00:24:10.532,"She does, but she's incredibly attractive with them."
00:24:10.532,00:24:12.118,She's a ten.
00:24:12.159,00:24:13.577,Go on three.
00:24:13.619,00:24:14.536,Yeah.
00:24:14.578,00:24:15.996,I'll sound off.
00:24:16.038,00:24:17.915,One...
00:24:17.957,00:24:19.375,Two...
00:24:19.417,00:24:21.127,Three!
00:24:24.922,00:24:27.091,"That's, uh, Lauren..."
00:24:27.133,00:24:28.550,...Scott.
00:24:28.550,00:24:30.928,That-that's the girl from the video store?
00:24:30.970,00:24:34.098,That's right around the corner from the bar.
00:24:34.140,00:24:35.557,"Oh, wow."
00:24:35.557,00:24:38.227,Um... I had no idea.
00:24:38.269,00:24:39.561,"No, of course you didn't."
00:24:39.561,00:24:40.562,"Well, how-how could you know that?"
00:24:40.562,00:24:41.772,H-How could you know that?
00:24:41.814,00:24:45.567,"did she actually say she wanted to go out on a date with you, though?"
00:24:45.567,00:24:47.569,"You know what, I'm gonna make this really easy."
00:24:47.569,00:24:49.571,"Um, I'm gonna bow out."
00:24:49.571,00:24:50.948,"Wait. No, hang on a sec."
00:24:49.571,00:24:52.032,Did she actually say that she wanted to go out with you?
00:24:52.074,00:24:53.159,"Look, man, it doesn't matter."
00:24:53.200,00:24:54.327,But that's weird.
00:24:54.368,00:24:55.453,You're my best friend.
00:24:55.577,00:24:57.163,"You go, uh, date her."
00:24:57.204,00:25:00.458,"Yeah, b-besides the fact, if I got in the picture, it wouldn't even be fair."
00:25:00.582,00:25:02.584,"I'm s-- what, I'm sorry."
00:25:03.585,00:25:04.837,What does that mean?
00:25:04.878,00:25:07.840,"I mean, come on, man, you're not out there as much as I am."
00:25:07.881,00:25:12.594,"Uh, and like anything, practice makes, uh..."
00:25:12.594,00:25:13.929,Perfect?
00:25:13.971,00:25:15.597,Were you gonna say perfect?
00:25:15.597,00:25:17.933,"Maybe not perfect, but-but damn near close..."
00:25:17.975,00:25:19.352,Wow.
00:25:19.393,00:25:20.727,...to perfect.
00:25:20.769,00:25:22.604,"You believe that, as well?"
00:25:22.604,00:25:24.731,"And, uh, you don't have to bow out because of me."
00:25:24.773,00:25:25.816,I don't?
00:25:25.858,00:25:28.235,"I'm not concerned that she's gonna fall in love with you, pal."
00:25:28.277,00:25:30.863,"Wow-- uh, how very nice of you."
00:25:30.904,00:25:32.781,Thank you?
00:25:32.823,00:25:35.159,So do your thing.
00:25:35.201,00:25:36.618,Whatever that is.
00:25:36.618,00:25:39.746,"And, um... just let her decide."
00:25:39.788,00:25:42.624,Sure.
00:25:42.624,00:25:44.418,Yeah.
00:25:44.460,00:25:49.089,"And while we're at it, why don't we put some ground rules in, as well."
00:25:49.131,00:25:50.007,I think we should.
00:25:50.049,00:25:52.510,Number one: I don't think we should tell her that we know each other.
00:25:52.634,00:25:54.636,Number two: Let's stay out of each other's way.
00:25:54.636,00:25:57.639,"Number three: Yeah, no hanky-panky, no hanky-panky."
00:25:57.639,00:26:00.059,"God, you have not dated in a long time, have you?"
00:26:00.100,00:26:03.645,And if this ever starts to affect our friendship...
00:26:03.645,00:26:04.646,"Which it, which it won't."
00:26:04.646,00:26:06.106,...which it won't...
00:26:07.066,00:26:08.650,...then we walk away.
00:26:08.650,00:26:09.651,Done.
00:26:09.651,00:26:11.237,"So then we have, we have..."
00:26:11.278,00:26:12.821,We have a gentleman's agreement.
00:26:12.863,00:26:14.114,A gentleman's agreement. We do.
00:26:14.156,00:26:15.657,May the best man win.
00:26:15.657,00:26:18.118,The best man for her.
00:26:18.160,00:26:19.661,For her.
00:26:19.661,00:26:20.662,For the lady.
00:26:20.704,00:26:22.122,The best man for her.
00:26:36.929,00:26:37.888,Ooh!
00:26:37.930,00:26:41.225,"Uh, forgive me, sir, you startled me."
00:26:41.267,00:26:43.685,I understand you're Savile Row's finest.
00:26:43.685,00:26:45.521,"We do our best, sir."
00:26:45.563,00:26:49.149,"In that case, I'd like to have a suit in this fabric."
00:26:49.191,00:26:52.236,"Ah, South American vicuna."
00:26:52.278,00:26:53.695,An excellent choice indeed.
00:26:53.695,00:26:57.324,"One thing with my suits, I like to know they are one of a kind."
00:26:57.366,00:26:59.826,I wouldn't want to run into anyone wearing the same suit.
00:26:59.868,00:27:01.745,I'm sure you understand that.
00:27:01.787,00:27:08.085,"Uh, with this particular fabric, and color, I only made one other, and that was for a gentleman who lives quite far away."
00:27:08.127,00:27:09.295,How far exactly?
00:27:09.336,00:27:10.754,"Uh, Los Angeles."
00:27:10.796,00:27:12.714,Have you any reason to go there soon?
00:27:12.714,00:27:15.842,I do now.
00:27:17.803,00:27:19.305,"Hello, thanks for calling."
00:27:19.346,00:27:20.722,I'm sorry I'm not in at the moment.
00:27:20.722,00:27:23.267,"Please leave a message after the tone, I'll get back to you as soon as possible."
00:27:23.309,00:27:26.353,"Tuck, Tuck!"
00:27:26.395,00:27:28.730,"Where are you, man? 5:00."
00:27:28.730,00:27:32.734,"CHiPs marathon about to start, I got new sticks for Rock Band!"
00:27:32.734,00:27:34.361,Call me.
00:27:36.029,00:27:37.739,"Oh, my God, I love these places."
00:27:37.739,00:27:38.740,Good.
00:27:38.740,00:27:40.742,And we're not gonna leave here till we've spent all of our tokens!
00:27:40.742,00:27:41.994,"Hello, thanks for calling."
00:27:42.035,00:27:43.162,I'm sorry I'm not in at the moment.
00:27:43.203,00:27:44.330,Please leave a message after the tone.
00:27:44.371,00:27:45.914,I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
00:27:46.999,00:27:48.208,"Dude, where are you?!"
00:27:52.796,00:27:54.173,Oh!
00:27:54.214,00:28:00.762,"FDR: Hey, man, uh, it's about 5:43, uh... so, whatever, man."
00:28:00.762,00:28:04.183,Just hanging out...
00:28:04.224,00:28:07.102,Are you-- maybe-maybe your phone's turned off or something.
00:28:07.144,00:28:11.357,"But just check it to make-- well, clearly you can't check it and see if it-- eh, whatever."
00:28:11.398,00:28:12.441,Call me.
00:28:12.483,00:28:15.777,"So, the great air hockey cheat, it is."
00:28:15.777,00:28:17.904,I'm available for lessons any time.
00:28:19.781,00:28:20.782,But only for you.
00:28:20.782,00:28:22.951,Oh.
00:28:26.788,00:28:28.915,"You know, there's something else I want to show you."
00:28:28.957,00:28:31.835,"...after the tone, I'll get back to you as soon as possible."
00:28:31.877,00:28:34.838,"Hey, man, so, uh, I'm a little worried."
00:28:34.880,00:28:36.840,"I don't know if, um..."
00:28:36.882,00:28:41.470,"You haven't returned my calls for, like, a long time now, like, an hour, so, uh..."
00:28:41.512,00:28:45.265,"just give me a call if you, if you're okay, okay?"
00:28:45.307,00:28:46.475,Okay.
00:28:46.517,00:28:48.644,"I've said okay now, like, five times."
00:28:48.686,00:28:49.811,Give me a call.
00:28:49.811,00:28:51.397,Okay.
00:28:51.438,00:28:52.648,"Hey, where are we going?"
00:28:52.690,00:28:54.024,There are lions in here.
00:28:54.066,00:28:54.941,No!
00:28:54.983,00:28:56.068,Yes.
00:28:56.109,00:28:58.820,Are you serious?
00:28:58.820,00:29:01.907,Okay. Open.
00:29:03.825,00:29:05.994,LAUREN: Wow. It's so beautiful.
00:29:06.036,00:29:08.830,Come on.
00:29:08.830,00:29:10.666,We're going up there?
00:29:12.418,00:29:13.711,"You're gonna catch me, right?"
00:29:13.835,00:29:15.170,Yeah.
00:29:15.212,00:29:16.963,Absolutely.
00:29:17.005,00:29:18.215,One!
00:29:18.257,00:29:19.841,Yeah.
00:29:21.635,00:29:23.845,Two!
00:29:23.845,00:29:25.847,Three!
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.476,There you go.
00:29:29.518,00:29:31.853,"Oh, my gosh!"
00:29:33.313,00:29:35.608,"Okay, okay!"
00:29:35.649,00:29:36.650,Right!
00:29:49.079,00:29:50.748,What was that?!
00:29:50.872,00:29:52.458,"I'm sorry, I lost my grip."
00:29:52.499,00:29:53.875,You did that on purpose.
00:29:53.875,00:29:57.129,"Ah, maybe, maybe I did."
00:29:57.170,00:29:58.547,I think you did.
00:29:58.589,00:30:00.882,"Well, sometimes falling is the best part."
00:30:23.280,00:30:26.158,"Aw, hold on."
00:30:26.199,00:30:27.326,Hello.
00:30:27.367,00:30:28.702,"Hey, it's me."
00:30:28.744,00:30:30.162,Can you talk?
00:30:30.203,00:30:33.165,"It's just-- I don't know, I feel weird about dating two guys at once."
00:30:33.206,00:30:34.249,Are you serious?
00:30:34.291,00:30:35.709,Don't feel bad about dating two guys.
00:30:35.751,00:30:36.794,"This is good, okay?"
00:30:36.835,00:30:45.719,"You gotta go out there and live a life for women like me who can't, who have to have sex with the same guy every Wednesday night at 9:00, while we're eating Cheetos."
00:30:45.761,00:30:46.970,It's kind of awesome.
00:30:47.012,00:30:48.388,It is awesome.
00:30:48.430,00:30:50.140,For women everywhere.
00:30:50.182,00:30:51.809,That's the spirit! Do it!
00:30:51.850,00:30:53.686,And Bob's super horny; I gotta go.
00:30:53.727,00:30:55.145,Okay. Bye.
00:30:55.187,00:30:56.271,"Okay, for women everywhere."
00:30:56.313,00:30:58.524,"I love it, I love it, I love it."
00:31:02.444,00:31:04.946,Tuck.
00:31:04.946,00:31:06.532,Where's your partner?
00:31:06.573,00:31:08.325,"Oh, he went out on a date."
00:31:08.367,00:31:09.326,Course he did.
00:31:09.368,00:31:10.536,Guy's an assassin.
00:31:10.577,00:31:11.995,"Slays everything he sets his sights on, right?"
00:31:15.624,00:31:18.001,We got a positive lock on that license plate.
00:31:18.043,00:31:20.379,You want us to put it up?
00:31:20.420,00:31:22.798,"No. Actually, no, don't."
00:31:24.591,00:31:25.509,"Yeah, go on."
00:31:25.551,00:31:26.552,"If you would, thanks, yeah."
00:31:26.593,00:31:27.636,Mm-hmm.
00:31:27.678,00:31:29.722,"No, we can't."
00:31:31.014,00:31:32.516,"Yeah, you got to do it now."
00:31:32.558,00:31:33.517,Go on.
00:31:33.559,00:31:34.976,"I'm here now, go on."
00:31:46.613,00:31:47.989,Wow.
00:31:47.989,00:31:49.575,Wasn't sure if you were gonna show.
00:31:49.616,00:31:51.618,Told you I could handle it.
00:31:51.660,00:31:52.994,We'll see. Come on.
00:31:52.994,00:31:54.830,Oh. I don't want to lose my spot.
00:31:54.872,00:31:56.874,Don't worry about it.
00:31:56.998,00:31:58.041,After you.
00:31:58.083,00:32:01.002,Go ahead.
00:32:01.002,00:32:02.254,Let 'em through.
00:32:02.295,00:32:04.548,"Good to see you, buddy."
00:32:04.590,00:32:06.007,"You'll gonna love this place, I swear to God."
00:32:06.007,00:32:08.009,"Hey, Ciera. How are you?"
00:32:08.009,00:32:10.011,I think you're enjoying yourself.
00:32:10.011,00:32:11.597,You just have to loosen up.
00:32:11.638,00:32:13.139,Get off the simmer.
00:32:13.181,00:32:14.808,Nathaniel!
00:32:14.850,00:32:16.393,"What's up, baby?"
00:32:16.435,00:32:17.603,Look at you!
00:32:20.313,00:32:23.609,You are shining like a bright light.
00:32:23.650,00:32:26.236,You guys are here! Come on!
00:32:26.278,00:32:29.030,"All right, I got to go say hi to the deejay."
00:32:29.030,00:32:30.031,He knows me.
00:32:30.073,00:32:31.491,"Come on, come on in."
00:32:31.533,00:32:33.911,"Come on, come on."
00:32:34.035,00:32:35.788,What's up?
00:32:35.829,00:32:37.664,"After you, my lady."
00:32:39.499,00:32:43.044,"'85 Veuve, Sammy."
00:32:53.054,00:32:54.807,Hey! Where you going?
00:32:54.848,00:32:56.475,Where you going?
00:32:56.516,00:32:59.060,You know what?
00:32:59.102,00:33:00.938,"Oh, come on, just..."
00:33:01.062,00:33:03.064,"Come inside for a minute, we'll have a good time."
00:33:03.064,00:33:04.524,It's really okay.
00:33:04.566,00:33:08.069,"When I was a gymnast back in high school, my best event was the keg stand."
00:33:08.069,00:33:09.863,You're a gymnast?
00:33:09.905,00:33:10.864,Unbelievable.
00:33:10.906,00:33:12.073,"Well, it's a valid question."
00:33:12.073,00:33:13.867,"You said you were a gymnast, I asked a question."
00:33:13.909,00:33:15.661,That is exactly why I'm walking away right now.
00:33:15.702,00:33:18.538,Wait. Because you're-you're uptight and you don't know how to have a good time?
00:33:18.580,00:33:21.667,You have the emotional intelligence of a 15-year-old boy.
00:33:23.084,00:33:26.254,"And you think I would be interested in going out with you, or going back up in da club?"
00:33:26.296,00:33:27.297,I don't think so.
00:33:27.339,00:33:29.090,"Thank you, judgmental princess."
00:33:29.090,00:33:32.093,Can we just call it a night?
00:33:32.093,00:33:33.094,Good night.
00:33:33.094,00:33:34.680,Have fun.
00:33:34.721,00:33:36.556,Go back to the retirement village. I'll see you soon.
00:33:37.766,00:33:39.643,"Oh, my God."
00:33:41.311,00:33:42.562,Come back here!
00:33:42.604,00:33:43.689,"Wait, w-w-wait!"
00:33:43.730,00:33:44.773,Just-just kiss me.
00:33:44.815,00:33:46.107,Absolutely not.
00:33:46.107,00:33:48.276,Why would I kiss you? No!
00:33:48.318,00:33:50.111,I'm not gonna kiss you.
00:33:50.111,00:33:51.571,Stop!
00:33:51.613,00:33:52.865,Oh.
00:33:55.116,00:33:56.952,Lauren.
00:33:56.994,00:33:58.119,Uh...
00:33:58.119,00:33:59.913,"Lauren, hey."
00:33:59.955,00:34:01.122,Oh.
00:34:01.122,00:34:02.875,"Oh, Steve."
00:34:02.916,00:34:05.961,"Oh, my God, that is so funny running into you again."
00:34:06.003,00:34:07.796,So funny.
00:34:07.838,00:34:11.132,"Um, this is my boyfriend, FDR."
00:34:12.592,00:34:13.886,Huh.
00:34:13.927,00:34:16.137,"Uh, he's the surgeon that we were talking about."
00:34:16.137,00:34:17.347,Huh.
00:34:17.389,00:34:19.140,Yeah.
00:34:21.935,00:34:23.979,Neurosurgeon.
00:34:24.021,00:34:25.271,Oh.
00:34:24.021,00:34:26.481,I'm the department head at the Children's Hospital.
00:34:26.523,00:34:27.566,"KELLY: Wow, that's amazing."
00:34:27.607,00:34:29.150,Aw.
00:34:29.150,00:34:31.528,He's really amazing.
00:34:31.570,00:34:32.905,"You know, I got to be honest with you."
00:34:32.946,00:34:36.742,"I don't know what makes me happier, the smile on a child's face or waking up next to you every morning."
00:34:36.783,00:34:37.701,I love you.
00:34:37.743,00:34:38.785,"I love you, too."
00:34:38.827,00:34:39.995,That's so funny.
00:34:40.037,00:34:40.996,Jinx.
00:34:42.039,00:34:42.915,We're really happy.
00:34:42.956,00:34:44.332,"Yeah, we are. We are."
00:34:44.374,00:34:46.710,But who wouldn't be happy with a girl like this? Look at her.
00:34:46.752,00:34:48.628,She's got everything.
00:34:46.752,00:34:50.171,"She got the beauty, the style, the grace."
00:34:50.171,00:34:51.757,Did you know she was a gymnast in high school?
00:34:51.798,00:34:53.174,"No, I didn't know that."
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.217,Didn't think so.
00:34:54.259,00:34:56.511,Yeah. He likes it.
00:34:57.429,00:34:58.931,Ooh!
00:34:58.972,00:35:00.432,"Frisky, I love it."
00:35:00.473,00:35:02.350,Mm-hmm.
00:35:03.476,00:35:05.562,You gonna do that thing on the high bar again?
00:35:05.604,00:35:07.188,"Yeah, you know what?"
00:35:05.604,00:35:09.190,"I think, uh, I think we should probably get going."
00:35:09.232,00:35:11.526,"Stan, it was such a pleasure."
00:35:11.568,00:35:13.028,We got to go.
00:35:11.568,00:35:14.195,"My name's Steve, but that's cool."
00:35:14.195,00:35:15.739,Great meeting you.
00:35:15.781,00:35:16.740,Really nice meeting you.
00:35:16.782,00:35:17.657,Really nice meeting you.
00:35:17.699,00:35:19.200,"Sweetheart, it was such a pleasure."
00:35:19.200,00:35:20.452,"Oh, look at that."
00:35:20.493,00:35:22.037,A little kiss on the hand there.
00:35:22.079,00:35:22.996,That's sweet.
00:35:23.038,00:35:24.247,You are so lucky.
00:35:24.289,00:35:25.791,I know.
00:35:25.832,00:35:27.084,Yeah.
00:35:27.208,00:35:28.334,"Bye now, guys. Yeah."
00:35:28.376,00:35:29.335,Yeah.
00:35:29.377,00:35:31.004,"Have fun, Simon."
00:35:31.046,00:35:33.214,"Okay, thank you so much."
00:35:33.214,00:35:34.591,"I'm sorry, what did you say?"
00:35:34.633,00:35:35.842,This-this ear's a little deaf.
00:35:35.884,00:35:37.218,I said thank you.
00:35:37.218,00:35:39.096,You don't have to be annoying about it.
00:35:39.220,00:35:40.764,Do you want to go grab a bite?
00:35:40.806,00:35:43.224,I know a pizza place around the corner.
00:35:44.267,00:35:47.687,You owe me an explanation for whatever that was.
00:35:47.729,00:35:49.564,"Okay, you're right, I do."
00:35:49.606,00:35:50.565,Sure.
00:35:50.607,00:35:52.818,Let's go.
00:35:52.859,00:35:56.863,So I packed up my entire life and I followed him out here.
00:35:56.905,00:36:00.241,"And six months later, I found him in bed with a Pilates instructor."
00:36:00.241,00:36:02.035,Mm.
00:36:02.077,00:36:03.453,He's just not the guy I thought he was.
00:36:03.495,00:36:04.663,I feel like I made a mistake.
00:36:04.704,00:36:06.247,I don't believe in mistakes.
00:36:06.289,00:36:10.002,"Well, that's a very convenient philosophy for someone like yourself."
00:36:10.043,00:36:11.878,It's the mistakes that make us who we are.
00:36:11.920,00:36:13.922,"They led you here, right?"
00:36:13.964,00:36:16.675,Would you rather be back in Atlanta right now?
00:36:16.716,00:36:18.093,"No, not really."
00:36:18.135,00:36:20.095,"And they led you to your job, and you like the job."
00:36:20.137,00:36:22.263,I love my job.
00:36:22.263,00:36:24.265,Just saying.
00:36:26.101,00:36:27.519,You're very smart.
00:36:27.560,00:36:28.854,Mm-hmm.
00:36:28.895,00:36:30.271,Pretty smart for a club rat.
00:36:30.271,00:36:32.273,"Oh, ouch."
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.489,Good morning.
00:36:41.449,00:36:43.702,Nice-looking woman from last night.
00:36:54.504,00:36:56.548,You reconned my date.
00:36:56.589,00:36:58.424,What? No.
00:36:58.466,00:37:00.093,"Yeah, you did."
00:37:00.135,00:37:01.302,Okay.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.304,"I'm sorry, I did."
00:37:03.304,00:37:04.723,We had a deal.
00:37:04.764,00:37:06.307,I'm sorry that I just started thinking and I...
00:37:06.307,00:37:07.308,You started thinking?
00:37:07.350,00:37:09.144,"And I had to find out to know, that's all."
00:37:09.186,00:37:12.898,"So if there was some action, what-what were you gonna do, call-call in Special Ops?"
00:37:12.939,00:37:13.982,Sniper squad?
00:37:14.024,00:37:15.483,"No! No, I'm sorry..."
00:37:15.525,00:37:20.321,Our Munich office got a hit back on one of Heinrich's men from Hong Kong.
00:37:20.321,00:37:21.573,Name's Ivan Sokolov.
00:37:21.614,00:37:24.910,Here's a surveillance file from the DFS in Mexico.
00:37:24.951,00:37:27.913,We expect he's trying to get Heinrich into the country through the L.A. Harbor.
00:37:27.954,00:37:31.083,Chatter suggests Ivan lives here in L.A.
00:37:31.124,00:37:32.458,Now flush him out.
00:37:32.500,00:37:36.379,She's definitely lost her sparkle.
00:37:36.421,00:37:41.342,"All right, look, you flag Interpol, I'll call some of our contacts."
00:37:46.347,00:37:48.349,I really like this girl.
00:37:48.391,00:37:50.143,"I really like her, too."
00:37:50.185,00:37:52.353,"No, I really, really like her."
00:37:52.395,00:37:53.772,So do I.
00:37:53.813,00:37:54.522,You do?
00:37:54.564,00:37:56.983,"Yeah, I do."
00:37:57.025,00:37:58.359,So you're not backing off?
00:37:58.359,00:37:59.527,Nope.
00:37:59.569,00:38:01.988,Okay.
00:38:03.364,00:38:11.706,"Then you ought to know that when we went out on our date, Lauren and I-- we, um..."
00:38:11.748,00:38:13.208,What?
00:38:14.793,00:38:15.919,What-what? What'd you do?
00:38:17.796,00:38:19.380,We shared a kiss.
00:38:19.380,00:38:20.548,Wow.
00:38:20.590,00:38:21.800,Mm-hmm.
00:38:21.841,00:38:24.719,Incredibly magical kiss with Tuck.
00:38:24.761,00:38:27.722,"Oh, dear, wonderful."
00:38:27.764,00:38:29.849,You are an animal.
00:38:29.891,00:38:32.393,"Look, pal, we kissed, too."
00:38:32.393,00:38:33.603,It was pretty special.
00:38:33.645,00:38:35.396,And I don't think it'll be the last.
00:38:35.396,00:38:37.232,"Well, we'll see about that, won't we?"
00:38:37.274,00:38:38.650,We shall see about that.
00:38:38.691,00:38:39.734,"Yes, we will."
00:38:39.776,00:38:40.777,We will see about that.
00:38:40.819,00:38:43.404,Don't do that.
00:38:43.404,00:38:44.823,Don't say what I just said.
00:38:44.864,00:38:47.033,We will see about that.
00:38:47.075,00:38:48.994,About that we will see.
00:38:49.035,00:38:51.830,We will see about that.
00:38:51.871,00:38:53.999,About that we will see.
00:38:54.040,00:38:55.416,Right! This is a live operation.
00:38:55.416,00:38:57.169,"It's a full wrap and tap, boys."
00:38:57.210,00:39:00.421,"I want parabolics, infrareds, your sat-cams, everything we've got on the job."
00:39:00.421,00:39:03.591,I want you to acquire intel on one Lauren Scott.
00:39:03.633,00:39:05.218,What are her secret likes...
00:39:05.260,00:39:06.427,...dislikes.
00:39:06.469,00:39:09.264,"I want to know what makes her laugh, what makes her cry..."
00:39:09.306,00:39:10.640,"Best friends, family members..."
00:39:10.682,00:39:12.184,Everything is important.
00:39:12.225,00:39:13.852,...and the last three guys she slept with.
00:39:13.893,00:39:15.854,Who she was sleeping with last week.
00:39:15.895,00:39:17.438,You want us to take them out?
00:39:17.480,00:39:18.690,You want us to take them out?
00:39:18.731,00:39:20.483,Yeah...
00:39:20.525,00:39:22.443,No.
00:39:22.443,00:39:24.445,No.
00:39:24.445,00:39:26.447,What exactly does this have to do with the Heinrich case?
00:39:26.447,00:39:27.782,I'm afraid that's Level Five Classified...
00:39:27.824,00:39:29.075,...for my eyes only.
00:39:30.160,00:39:31.870,This operation is top secret.
00:39:31.911,00:39:33.454,"Don't let your country down, boys."
00:39:33.454,00:39:34.455,Roger that.
00:40:39.020,00:40:41.147,Aw.
00:41:28.569,00:41:30.571,What the hell is going on in here?
00:41:30.571,00:41:32.031,Nothing!
00:41:32.073,00:41:37.996,"Well, I'm sorry to interrupt playtime, but we have an address on Ivan Sokolov, and I thought you boys might want to get out of the office."
00:41:38.037,00:41:39.622,Absolutely.
00:41:43.251,00:41:44.585,"I'll take lead, you run backup."
00:41:44.585,00:41:47.588,"No, I was thinking of taking lead on this one, thank you."
00:41:47.588,00:41:49.341,I'm always the first one in the door.
00:41:49.382,00:41:51.176,"You're not always first at everything, mate."
00:41:51.217,00:41:53.761,"Hello. We're, um..."
00:41:53.803,00:41:56.014,friends of Ivan.
00:41:58.183,00:42:00.143,"Aw, no, take lead, please."
00:42:00.185,00:42:02.354,"No, no, honestly, after you."
00:42:03.396,00:42:04.356,Brut?
00:42:04.397,00:42:05.357,Patchouli.
00:42:05.398,00:42:07.608,"Oh, I love Patchouli."
00:42:09.694,00:42:11.612,buddy down there.
00:42:11.612,00:42:13.614,Hello! Cards!
00:42:13.614,00:42:15.200,Shh. Shh.
00:42:13.614,00:42:16.742,"Mate, I am such a huge fan of poker!"
00:42:16.784,00:42:19.871,He-he actually won the-the Go Fish Masters tournament in Reno.
00:42:19.912,00:42:21.622,This is private game.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.166,"Oi! Don't wave your hands at me, chief!"
00:42:23.208,00:42:24.625,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:42:24.625,00:42:27.962,"Whoa, whoa. He got into the rosé at brunch; he's gonzo."
00:42:28.004,00:42:30.256,I said this is private game!
00:42:30.298,00:42:31.799,"I know who you are, mate."
00:42:33.092,00:42:34.635,Ivan!
00:42:34.635,00:42:35.636,The terrible!
00:42:37.138,00:42:38.806,Wait. We're friends with Karl Heinrich.
00:42:38.848,00:42:41.642,There's one little problem.
00:42:44.521,00:42:46.647,Heinrich doesn't have any friends.
00:42:46.647,00:42:48.066,"Oh, dear."
00:42:55.031,00:42:56.657,Give me a mag!
00:42:56.657,00:42:58.910,Do you ever come prepared?!
00:42:58.951,00:43:00.661,"That's bollocks, mate!"
00:43:10.046,00:43:11.672,"Tuck, get down!"
00:43:23.684,00:43:25.311,Get down!
00:43:51.504,00:43:53.256,There you are.
00:43:53.298,00:43:54.715,"No, I got him."
00:43:54.715,00:43:55.716,"Yeah, of course you did, mate."
00:43:55.716,00:43:57.718,I love your work.
00:43:57.718,00:44:03.724,"Tell us where Heinrich is, we may be able to cut you a deal, Ivan."
00:44:03.766,00:44:05.017,I'm not saying anything.
00:44:06.102,00:44:10.731,"Okay. You get three square meals a day, and we'll get you a nice pair of trousers."
00:44:10.731,00:44:11.608,"Yeah, let's go."
00:44:11.732,00:44:13.276,"Give deodorant a chance, Ivan."
00:44:13.318,00:44:15.570,You stink!
00:44:21.742,00:44:23.077,What's happening?
00:44:23.119,00:44:24.370,Hmm?
00:44:24.412,00:44:26.414,"Uh, Collins."
00:44:26.456,00:44:27.373,Yeah.
00:44:27.415,00:44:28.749,You?
00:44:28.749,00:44:30.168,Just the intel flash coming over.
00:44:30.209,00:44:32.753,I'll see to that.
00:44:32.753,00:44:33.963,She texted her friend Trish.
00:44:34.005,00:44:40.761,"Said she needed to talk because she was F-T-F-O, which the cryptography department believes means she was Freaking the Fuck Out, sir!"
00:44:40.761,00:44:42.388,I... I S-H-I-T you not.
00:44:42.430,00:44:43.889,I was L-M-F-A-O when I read that.
00:44:43.931,00:44:45.766,"It was crazy, ridiculous..."
00:44:45.766,00:44:48.019,S-H-H-H-H-H.
00:44:48.060,00:44:51.189,Trish then called the babysitter and told her it was an emergency.
00:44:51.230,00:44:52.898,Was it serious?
00:44:52.940,00:44:55.151,LAUREN: Can't believe this is my biggest problem.
00:44:55.193,00:44:58.988,"Last month, I was dating my Boggle set, and this month, I'm dating two gorgeous guys."
00:44:59.030,00:45:02.617,"Okay, first of all, I need you to stop making references to Boggle like it's a man; it's a game."
00:45:02.783,00:45:06.037,And you sound like a woman who has nine cats and knits her ass off.
00:45:06.078,00:45:07.455,And you never said they were gorgeous.
00:45:07.497,00:45:08.789,You said they were good-looking.
00:45:08.789,00:45:09.957,There's a difference between good-looking and gorgeous.
00:45:09.999,00:45:11.792,You want to see a picture of them?
00:45:11.792,00:45:13.961,Okay.
00:45:14.003,00:45:14.920,Oh!
00:45:14.962,00:45:16.172,Wow!
00:45:16.214,00:45:17.674,Right?
00:45:17.798,00:45:24.389,"You know when you know you're gonna have dirty sex and it's gonna stink-- not like sex, I mean, like man-stink, the good stuff."
00:45:24.430,00:45:26.349,That's pretty impressive.
00:45:26.391,00:45:28.226,"For you, yeah!"
00:45:28.267,00:45:29.644,What does the other one look like?
00:45:29.686,00:45:31.812,"You just scroll over, you do the finger thing."
00:45:34.190,00:45:35.816,TRISH: I am impressed with you.
00:45:35.816,00:45:37.569,You scared the shit out of me.
00:45:37.610,00:45:38.819,That man is-- he's dirty.
00:45:38.819,00:45:40.196,You all right?
00:45:40.238,00:45:42.156,Medically speaking?
00:45:42.198,00:45:43.449,"LAUREN: They're people, not products."
00:45:43.491,00:45:45.826,"You're not a very good liar, you know that?"
00:45:45.826,00:45:48.829,"Oh, yes, and you are."
00:45:48.829,00:45:52.667,"Seeing as we're both here, we might as well share resources."
00:45:52.709,00:45:54.168,Guess I don't have a choice.
00:45:54.210,00:45:55.086,"Please, sit down."
00:45:55.127,00:45:56.504,"Oh, I'm staying."
00:45:56.546,00:45:58.047,"TRISH: Okay, good, good."
00:45:58.089,00:46:06.847,"Well, I'm available as a friend, if you want me to have sex with both of those guys, just to test out stuff and see who comes back a winner and who doesn't."
00:46:05.263,00:46:09.684,"I would be willing to let them do it from behind, obviously, 'cause I don't want it to be awkward."
00:46:09.726,00:46:13.104,And they wouldn't even know it was me; I would pretend I was you. I'd just put my hair maybe up in a pony.
00:46:13.145,00:46:18.610,"And obviously I'm busy, 'cause I'm a mother, but I would carve out time in my schedule, because that's the kind of friend I am."
00:46:18.651,00:46:20.861,Why is she listening to that old man?
00:46:20.861,00:46:22.447,I have no idea.
00:46:22.488,00:46:24.865,Okay. You know what?
00:46:24.865,00:46:30.871,"Okay, fine. Then why don't we do one of your little focus groups that you do at work, and you can be the focus group, and I can be in charge, like you."
00:46:30.871,00:46:32.248,"Oh, that's actually a good idea."
00:46:32.290,00:46:33.874,"Okay. This is good, this is good."
00:46:33.874,00:46:35.543,I like this.
00:46:33.874,00:46:37.503,"Okay, so I will ask you questions about the products-- Okay."
00:46:37.545,00:46:40.881,the people-- and you tell me who you like and why.
00:46:40.923,00:46:42.883,LAUREN: I don't know.
00:46:42.883,00:46:43.926,"I mean, what a struggle."
00:46:43.968,00:46:47.680,"Okay, I have to go home and clean tartar sauce out of Bob's beard right now."
00:46:47.722,00:46:48.889,And probably one of his undescended testicles.
00:46:48.931,00:46:51.934,And you're gonna sit here and talk to me about how amazing these two guys are.
00:46:51.976,00:46:53.227,Is there anything bad about them?
00:46:53.269,00:46:54.895,"Okay, let me think."
00:46:54.895,00:46:55.896,Flaws.
00:46:55.896,00:46:58.065,I think there...
00:46:58.107,00:46:59.609,there is one thing.
00:47:01.193,00:47:04.656,"FDR has these tiny, like, girl hands."
00:47:04.697,00:47:05.740,"Like, little T-Rex hands."
00:47:07.408,00:47:08.785,"TRISH: Ew, gross!"
00:47:08.909,00:47:10.911,That means he's got a Mike and Ike for a penis.
00:47:13.205,00:47:14.540,You know that's not true.
00:47:14.582,00:47:16.917,You've seen it.
00:47:16.917,00:47:19.504,You've seen it in Bangladesh; you know that's not true.
00:47:19.545,00:47:20.921,Ah.
00:47:20.921,00:47:23.299,And Tuck is British.
00:47:24.925,00:47:26.135,What is that supposed to mean?
00:47:26.177,00:47:27.679,"TRISH: Okay, so that doesn't mean anything."
00:47:27.720,00:47:28.929,"That's the same, they're kind of even."
00:47:28.929,00:47:31.182,So I need you to get into decision-making mode.
00:47:31.223,00:47:33.100,And I need you to do it kind of quickly.
00:47:33.142,00:47:35.812,"I mean, it's fun, but I'm not the one having sex."
00:47:35.936,00:47:37.104,So I can't be that invested.
00:47:37.146,00:47:38.731,Okay. You know what I need?
00:47:38.773,00:47:40.941,Mm. A joint.
00:47:40.983,00:47:42.193,"No, I need a deadline."
00:47:42.234,00:47:43.944,Okay.
00:47:42.234,00:47:45.404,So I'm gonna give myself a finite amount of time to make this decision.
00:47:45.446,00:47:46.280,That's good.
00:47:46.322,00:47:47.948,One week I have to make a decision.
00:47:47.948,00:47:49.158,TRISH: One week?
00:47:51.410,00:47:53.579,"Okay, so she grew up in Georgia."
00:47:53.621,00:47:55.373,She likes to volunteer at dog shelters.
00:47:55.414,00:47:59.544,She's a fan of classic rock and collecting mini Camaros.
00:47:59.585,00:48:00.961,"What, as in the cars?"
00:48:00.961,00:48:05.966,LAUREN: You're such a natural in this.
00:48:05.966,00:48:08.594,"It's just so weird, 'cause my Dad used to collect these!"
00:48:08.636,00:48:10.513,They were never as nice as this one!
00:48:10.555,00:48:11.972,But he never let me drive them!
00:48:11.972,00:48:13.850,"Oh, I can't possibly imagine why he wouldn't do that."
00:48:25.986,00:48:28.989,Did he just give our bird the bird?
00:48:38.165,00:48:39.208,What was that?!
00:48:39.250,00:48:41.043,"What? Well, that was, uh, the exhaust."
00:48:41.085,00:48:42.754,Oh.
00:48:44.672,00:48:46.006,"No, no, no!"
00:48:47.299,00:48:49.761,"She likes red wine, lavender bath salts."
00:48:49.802,00:48:53.013,Mm-hmm.
00:48:53.013,00:48:54.014,Huh?
00:48:54.056,00:48:55.683,Yeah. Austrian cat.
00:48:55.725,00:48:57.017,Boy can paint.
00:48:57.017,00:48:58.895,Ain't you never seen The Kiss?
00:49:00.020,00:49:01.313,"Yeah, no, of course I have."
00:49:08.279,00:49:10.239,Is this what I think it is?
00:49:10.281,00:49:12.032,You're a fan?
00:49:12.032,00:49:13.158,Of Gustav Klimt?
00:49:13.200,00:49:14.869,Of Gustav Klimt.
00:49:14.911,00:49:16.871,He's my favorite artist.
00:49:16.913,00:49:18.706,This is incredible.
00:49:18.748,00:49:19.707,Are these real?
00:49:19.749,00:49:21.584,Yeah.
00:49:21.626,00:49:23.043,"Okay, stop."
00:49:23.043,00:49:23.920,You recognize this?
00:49:24.044,00:49:25.045,Yes.
00:49:25.045,00:49:28.424,"I have this-- Uh, yes, I've seen it in a book, but you're kidding me."
00:49:28.466,00:49:32.052,Look at the tension between the two and three dimensionality.
00:49:32.052,00:49:34.639,Do you see the tension between the two and three dimensionality?
00:49:34.680,00:49:36.098,How do you know this?
00:49:36.140,00:49:38.058,"Undine, 1902."
00:49:38.058,00:49:39.811,"Undine, 1902."
00:49:39.852,00:49:42.480,"Oh, my goodness, this is amazing."
00:49:42.521,00:49:44.690,Innovation became intrinsic...
00:49:44.732,00:49:46.275,...to Degas and the other Modernists.
00:49:46.317,00:49:48.068,You can see the influence of Art Nouveau.
00:49:48.110,00:49:50.488,"You know, he was a strong advocate of the finger-painting movement."
00:49:50.529,00:49:51.280,What?
00:49:51.322,00:49:53.073,Hey.
00:49:53.073,00:49:53.950,We lost contact.
00:49:54.074,00:49:58.287,Sometimes he would finger his paintings to get closer to them.
00:49:58.329,00:50:01.081,"He, uh, used-used his..."
00:50:01.081,00:50:07.296,"he would, he would, he would... the intimacy with the canvas to-to finger a painting..."
00:50:07.338,00:50:08.339,to...
00:50:10.299,00:50:15.053,...rather to paint using...
00:50:15.095,00:50:18.766,Sometimes he would use mud and sticks.
00:50:18.808,00:50:22.018,"You know, he used mud and He did?"
00:50:23.145,00:50:24.689,And if he couldn't find a stick...
00:50:24.730,00:50:26.064,"And if he couldn't find a stick, he..."
00:50:26.106,00:50:28.066,...would use his dick.
00:50:28.108,00:50:29.777,What?
00:50:30.736,00:50:32.070,Oh! Son of a bitch.
00:50:33.906,00:50:34.699,Aw!
00:50:35.783,00:50:37.660,You know...
00:50:37.702,00:50:40.329,"I think, enough talking."
00:50:42.122,00:50:45.334,Let's let the paintings speak for themselves.
00:50:48.587,00:50:51.089,"Oh, my God."
00:50:51.131,00:50:54.092,Wow.
00:50:54.134,00:50:56.971,That is so beautiful.
00:50:57.013,00:50:59.055,That's amazing.
00:51:07.982,00:51:09.942,Just incredible.
00:51:09.984,00:51:11.318,Yeah.
00:51:11.360,00:51:12.904,It is.
00:51:12.945,00:51:14.780,Thank you.
00:51:16.532,00:51:18.158,TRISH: Hello.
00:51:18.158,00:51:19.159,How'd it go?
00:51:19.159,00:51:20.369,They both went well. Too well.
00:51:20.411,00:51:22.162,I don't know what to do.
00:51:22.162,00:51:23.372,That's awesome.
00:51:23.414,00:51:24.749,"All right, go up on five."
00:51:24.790,00:51:26.500,Let's just pump the audio a little bit.
00:51:26.542,00:51:28.627,"Are you sure about this, sir?"
00:51:28.669,00:51:30.629,We might have some Constitutional issues here.
00:51:30.671,00:51:33.173,Patriot Act.
00:51:35.175,00:51:37.177,TRISH: So how was it?
00:51:37.177,00:51:38.971,LAUREN: They're both incredible.
00:51:39.013,00:51:43.059,"Uh, FDR has these amazing eyes that you just, oh, want to melt into."
00:51:43.183,00:51:44.184,He's so beautiful.
00:51:44.184,00:51:45.352,He brings out the best in me.
00:51:45.394,00:51:47.187,"He really challenges me, you know."
00:51:47.187,00:51:50.983,"But he's that guy who's always on, he's super-slick."
00:51:51.025,00:51:53.527,Sometimes I think he doesn't care about anything more than himself.
00:51:56.447,00:51:59.324,"FDR: Well, they say it's a sanctuary for them, but it's..."
00:51:59.366,00:52:01.201,Aw.
00:52:01.201,00:52:02.453,It's amazing.
00:52:02.494,00:52:04.204,Really more of a sanctuary for me.
00:52:04.204,00:52:05.790,"Hey, Rebecca."
00:52:05.831,00:52:06.749,"Hey, Betty."
00:52:06.791,00:52:08.208,Excuse me?
00:52:08.208,00:52:10.461,I just had no idea you were so passionate about animals.
00:52:10.502,00:52:12.838,Yeah. Animals and... kids.
00:52:12.880,00:52:14.256,What's up?
00:52:14.298,00:52:15.424,"How you doing, Nick?"
00:52:15.466,00:52:16.884,What?
00:52:16.926,00:52:20.096,"There are a lot of things you don't know about me, and..."
00:52:20.220,00:52:21.847,takes a while for me to open up.
00:52:21.889,00:52:24.224,I can see that.
00:52:25.851,00:52:28.228,"Oh, what's the matter?"
00:52:28.270,00:52:30.773,"Hey, little guy."
00:52:30.815,00:52:31.857,What's going on?
00:52:31.899,00:52:34.234,Are they-- are you allowed to open the cages?
00:52:34.276,00:52:35.694,All the time.
00:52:35.736,00:52:37.279,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:37.321,00:52:39.239,"Hey, Snuggles, how are you, bud?"
00:52:39.239,00:52:40.240,"Oh, it's a Boston terrier!"
00:52:40.282,00:52:41.700,I love these dogs.
00:52:46.246,00:52:47.623,Yeah.
00:52:47.665,00:52:49.083,That's a lot of energy.
00:52:49.125,00:52:51.043,I love this place.
00:52:52.670,00:52:54.880,Mm.
00:53:01.679,00:53:03.014,What's in your mouth?
00:53:03.055,00:53:04.264,Just a lot of dog hair.
00:53:04.264,00:53:06.100,Yeah.
00:53:08.268,00:53:09.854,Big mess.
00:53:09.895,00:53:11.897,Do you want to help me pick one out?
00:53:11.939,00:53:13.273,You're gonna adopt a dog?
00:53:13.273,00:53:18.487,"I just think it's time for me to be responsible for something other than myself, you know?"
00:53:18.529,00:53:20.156,Wow.
00:53:20.280,00:53:21.782,I think that's so great.
00:53:25.953,00:53:27.830,Okay.
00:53:27.872,00:53:31.125,"Let's pick the saddest, oldest bastard here."
00:53:33.293,00:53:34.837,"TRISH: Okay, what about Tuck?"
00:53:34.879,00:53:36.922,"LAUREN: Uh, Tuck is great."
00:53:36.964,00:53:38.924,"He's sweet, he's kind-- We have so much fun."
00:53:38.966,00:53:41.510,More fun than I've ever had in my entire life.
00:53:41.552,00:53:42.887,But he's maybe too sweet.
00:53:42.928,00:53:46.182,A little earnest.
00:53:46.306,00:53:48.308,"Um, sort of safe."
00:53:48.308,00:53:49.185,Yeah.
00:53:49.309,00:53:50.310,That's boring.
00:53:50.310,00:53:51.937,I almost fell asleep just listening to that.
00:53:51.979,00:53:53.689,Mm.
00:53:53.731,00:53:55.066,S-Safe.
00:53:55.107,00:53:56.358,"Okay, Tuck, I think I'm ready."
00:53:56.400,00:53:58.903,Right. Have you ever carried a weapon before?
00:53:58.944,00:54:00.445,"Well, you know, not really, no."
00:54:00.487,00:54:01.906,Okay. Okay.
00:54:00.487,00:54:03.657,I need you to keep that end of the weapon well away from me.
00:54:03.699,00:54:04.992,Clear?
00:54:05.034,00:54:06.326,Thumbs up.
00:54:06.326,00:54:07.327,This'll be fun.
00:54:07.327,00:54:08.328,No.
00:54:08.328,00:54:10.497,It's not fun.
00:54:10.539,00:54:11.916,It's dangerous.
00:54:16.837,00:54:19.339,"Okay, watch out."
00:54:20.507,00:54:21.550,"Aw, my face!"
00:54:21.592,00:54:22.551,And my balls!
00:54:22.593,00:54:23.719,"Oh, my God."
00:54:24.762,00:54:25.804,"Aw, geez, man!"
00:54:25.846,00:54:26.972,Come on!
00:54:27.014,00:54:28.348,"Come on, it's a game!"
00:54:28.348,00:54:29.349,Come on.
00:54:29.349,00:54:31.351,Okay.
00:54:32.436,00:54:34.479,"Oh, I got to get the goggles on."
00:54:34.521,00:54:36.190,This is very stressful!
00:54:36.232,00:54:37.733,MAN: I'm out!
00:54:37.775,00:54:38.776,All right.
00:54:38.817,00:54:39.944,Come along.
00:54:39.985,00:54:41.028,"Come on, come on."
00:54:41.070,00:54:42.487,WOMAN: Get him!
00:54:47.243,00:54:48.911,No head shot!
00:54:48.953,00:54:50.162,"Oh, my God."
00:54:50.204,00:54:52.748,"I'm scared, I'm scared."
00:54:55.042,00:54:56.668,It's a grenade!
00:55:02.841,00:55:05.177,Who is that guy?
00:55:05.219,00:55:06.762,"Whoa, dude!"
00:55:06.804,00:55:08.388,It's just...
00:55:08.388,00:55:09.932,WOMAN: Let's get out of here!
00:55:11.391,00:55:12.768,Yeah?
00:55:12.810,00:55:14.019,"Oh, yes."
00:55:16.396,00:55:17.731,"Oh, my God."
00:55:17.773,00:55:19.399,Did you see me light that up?
00:55:19.441,00:55:20.567,Okay.
00:55:20.609,00:55:22.402,That boy come right out of nowhere.
00:55:22.402,00:55:24.196,"Okay, you are disturbingly good at this."
00:55:24.238,00:55:25.072,"Aw, yeah."
00:55:25.114,00:55:27.241,"Yeah, how does that make you feel?"
00:55:27.283,00:55:30.410,"Like, if our nation gets attacked by random paintball people, I'll be safe."
00:55:30.410,00:55:31.996,Sa-Safe? Safe.
00:55:32.037,00:55:33.413,I-I tried to get your back there.
00:55:33.413,00:55:39.753,"I-I got off a few shots, but then I-I think my triggering mechanism was stuck, and I was, like, trying to get people and..."
00:55:39.795,00:55:41.421,Safety comes off.
00:55:41.421,00:55:43.757,"Oh, my God! Are you okay?!"
00:55:43.799,00:55:46.010,"Oh, I'm sorry I laugh..."
00:55:46.051,00:55:48.428,I have this laughter thing when bad things happen.
00:55:48.470,00:55:49.429,It's not funny.
00:55:49.471,00:55:50.555,I shouldn't do that.
00:55:50.597,00:55:52.016,Are you okay?
00:55:52.057,00:55:52.891,Can you walk?
00:55:52.933,00:55:53.976,"Yeah, I'm good, I'm good."
00:55:54.018,00:55:54.977,Okay.
00:55:55.019,00:55:58.230,"Oh, my God, I feel so bad."
00:55:58.272,00:55:59.815,"Yeah, it's good."
00:55:59.857,00:56:01.441,"Good. Come on, let's go get something to eat."
00:56:01.483,00:56:03.485,Okay.
00:56:03.527,00:56:06.613,LAUREN: So you know how I was telling you that Tuck has been really earnest?
00:56:06.655,00:56:12.244,"Well, the other day, we went paintballing, and he nearly put this kid's eye out with a paintball gun."
00:56:12.286,00:56:16.915,"And then FDR went to this animal shelter, and he adopted a 12-year-old dog with a milky eye."
00:56:16.957,00:56:18.458,"I'm telling you, it's getting weird."
00:56:18.458,00:56:21.920,And I can't help but thinking it's my fault that I'm putting them in this position.
00:56:21.962,00:56:23.463,It's making them crazy.
00:56:23.463,00:56:25.465,So what are you going to do about it?
00:56:25.465,00:56:29.469,I think I have to do what any rational woman in my position would do.
00:56:29.469,00:56:30.470,Break up with them?
00:56:30.470,00:56:31.555,Sleep with them.
00:56:33.473,00:56:35.351,Sex tiebreaker.
00:56:35.475,00:56:36.476,Finally! Finally!
00:56:36.476,00:56:38.478,A sex tiebreaker!
00:56:38.478,00:56:40.731,You have to have sex with both of them!
00:56:40.772,00:56:42.107,Thank you!
00:56:42.149,00:56:43.483,TRISH: What?
00:56:43.525,00:56:45.485,"It's called the birds and the bees, bitch, okay?"
00:56:45.485,00:56:46.486,Google it.
00:56:46.486,00:56:47.612,We had a deal.
00:56:47.654,00:56:49.031,"Well, we have a deal."
00:56:49.073,00:56:50.157,We have a deal.
00:56:50.199,00:56:51.533,I'm not going to have sex with her.
00:56:51.575,00:56:52.617,And I'm not...
00:56:51.575,00:56:54.119,"I am not going to have sex with this woman, either."
00:56:54.161,00:56:55.329,No matter how hard she tries.
00:56:55.371,00:56:56.496,No matter how hard she tries.
00:56:56.496,00:56:57.915,We have... we have a gentleman's agreement.
00:56:57.956,00:57:02.253,"We do-- we have a gentleman's agreement, and we are gentle men."
00:57:02.294,00:57:03.712,Okay?
00:57:03.754,00:57:06.173,Okay.
00:57:06.215,00:57:07.841,Okay.
00:57:07.883,00:57:09.260,Good.
00:57:10.510,00:57:11.762,Good Lord.
00:57:11.803,00:57:13.097,"Yeah, I got that thing, so..."
00:57:13.138,00:57:15.515,"Right. I got to be somewhere, so..."
00:57:16.516,00:57:18.518,Full-scale tactical prevention mode.
00:57:18.518,00:57:20.729,What exactly do you have in mind?
00:57:22.147,00:57:24.108,Wow. This is amazing.
00:57:24.149,00:57:25.525,Mm... do you...
00:57:25.525,00:57:26.526,How nice.
00:57:26.568,00:57:28.737,Do you think the candles are a bit cheesy?
00:57:28.779,00:57:31.365,No. I think they're wonderful.
00:57:31.407,00:57:35.535,This has been the perfect night.
00:57:41.541,00:57:43.543,Dickerman...
00:57:44.753,00:57:46.964,...make it rain.
00:57:58.350,00:57:59.768,Your really think you can trust him?
00:57:59.810,00:58:01.770,Absolutely not.
00:58:01.812,00:58:03.939,"Okay, I believe you."
00:58:03.981,00:58:05.565,Wow.
00:58:05.565,00:58:06.900,This is great.
00:58:06.942,00:58:08.193,Yeah?
00:58:08.235,00:58:09.569,Pool on the roof.
00:58:09.569,00:58:13.573,"Oh, you know, it's hydrotherapy for an old football injury."
00:58:17.577,00:58:19.704,"I'll be right back, okay?"
00:58:19.746,00:58:21.581,Okay.
00:58:39.599,00:58:40.934,Come on. Scram. Let's go.
00:58:45.605,00:58:46.815,Aah! God!
00:59:15.886,00:59:17.012,FDR?
00:59:18.638,00:59:20.640,Really?
00:59:22.476,00:59:24.019,A tranq dart.
00:59:24.061,00:59:25.270,A tranq dart!
00:59:25.312,00:59:27.647,"Three inches over, I would have been dead."
00:59:27.647,00:59:29.441,Four. Four inches.
00:59:29.483,00:59:31.443,Okay?
00:59:32.652,00:59:33.653,You Neanderthal.
00:59:33.653,00:59:34.654,"Morning, sirs."
00:59:34.654,00:59:35.822,"BOTH: Shut up, Jenkins!"
00:59:35.864,00:59:37.699,Jesus.
00:59:37.741,00:59:38.909,You were listening to Sade.
00:59:38.950,00:59:42.037,"Now, we both know what happens when you listen to Sade."
00:59:42.079,00:59:44.998,"Indeed, she is, but your hormones start going and you turn into Captain Horny Pants."
00:59:45.040,00:59:46.666,Captain Horn...?
00:59:45.040,00:59:49.336,"And might I remind you, you were the one who flooded my apartment first."
00:59:49.378,00:59:51.338,I was afraid the candles were a fire hazard.
00:59:51.380,00:59:56.427,"No, no, no. The only thing that you were worried about getting fired up was Lauren, wasn't it?"
00:59:56.468,00:59:58.470,"Honesty, Franklin."
00:59:58.512,01:00:00.264,Try it.
01:00:02.558,01:00:03.808,TUCK: Right!
01:00:03.850,01:00:19.575,"Now, I have very serious anger management issues today, Ivan, so I would appreciate it if you'd do me the courtesy of answering all my terribly boring questions sharpish."
01:00:19.616,01:00:21.493,The pliers? Really?
01:00:21.535,01:00:22.536,"Yes, the pliers, really."
01:00:22.578,01:00:23.661,"Predictable, safe and boring yet again."
01:00:23.703,01:00:32.421,"Why don't you tickle Ivan's feet till he talks with your teeny, tiny, itty-bitty jazz hands?"
01:00:38.718,01:00:41.638,"Where is Heinrich, Brother?"
01:00:41.805,01:00:46.351,Sooner or later he'll be coming for you.....Brother.
01:00:47.727,01:00:50.606,You're going to die.
01:00:52.149,01:00:53.900,"Don't worry, you're next."
01:01:11.001,01:01:13.545,I'm sorry about Jonas.
01:01:30.562,01:01:31.813,"Oh! Oh, God."
01:01:31.855,01:01:33.357,"Oh, no, no."
01:01:33.398,01:01:34.650,Just let him do his thing.
01:01:36.652,01:01:38.778,Oh. Hello.
01:01:38.778,01:01:40.780,"Uh, Nana, this is Lauren."
01:01:40.780,01:01:42.782,"Lauren, this is my grandmother Nana."
01:01:42.782,01:01:44.117,So...
01:01:44.159,01:01:47.204,you're the girl who's been putting up with Franklin.
01:01:47.245,01:01:48.788,Mm-hmm.
01:01:48.788,01:01:50.790,"Yeah, well, you know where the kitchen is."
01:01:50.790,01:01:53.793,Lauren and I have a lot to talk about.
01:01:58.798,01:02:01.801,"Yes, this is pretty, isn't it?"
01:02:02.844,01:02:04.804,"Oh, this is beautiful."
01:02:04.804,01:02:06.557,"Oh, is this FDR?"
01:02:06.598,01:02:07.807,"Oh, yes."
01:02:07.807,01:02:08.850,Look at that unibrow.
01:02:08.892,01:02:10.810,It goes all the way around his head.
01:02:10.810,01:02:12.396,I know.
01:02:12.437,01:02:13.564,"Hi, Dottie."
01:02:13.605,01:02:14.814,Who are these people?
01:02:14.814,01:02:15.940,Hmm?
01:02:15.982,01:02:18.818,"Oh, those are his parents."
01:02:18.860,01:02:22.489,They died when he was nine.
01:02:22.531,01:02:24.366,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
01:02:24.408,01:02:25.867,He never told me that.
01:02:25.909,01:02:27.703,Yeah.
01:02:27.827,01:02:34.459,"They were going out to dinner one night, and, um, well, he's never been quite the same since."
01:02:34.501,01:02:37.379,He has a hard time trusting people.
01:02:37.421,01:02:40.215,But he must trust you.
01:02:40.257,01:02:44.678,Because you are the first girl he's ever brought here.
01:02:46.346,01:02:49.516,"I have a hard time trusting people, too."
01:02:52.561,01:02:58.400,He had the biggest blue eyes-- like marbles-- which almost made up for the bed-wetting.
01:02:59.859,01:03:00.860,Nana.
01:03:00.860,01:03:03.405,We don't... we really don't have to talk about that right now.
01:03:03.447,01:03:04.864,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:03:04.864,01:03:05.865,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:03:05.865,01:03:06.866,I think we ought to.
01:03:06.866,01:03:09.661,He wore that Superman costume everywhere.
01:03:09.703,01:03:11.496,You wouldn't believe the smell.
01:03:12.581,01:03:15.875,NANA: But how were we to know that he would take it so literally?
01:03:15.875,01:03:17.877,The little fellow jumped off the roof.
01:03:19.879,01:03:22.674,"Uh... I was given misinformation, okay?"
01:03:22.716,01:03:25.093,"You know, we all make mistakes-- that was one of mine."
01:03:25.135,01:03:28.972,"Yes, but remember, Franklin, there are no mistakes."
01:03:31.891,01:03:33.017,To no mistakes.
01:03:33.059,01:03:35.687,To no mistakes.
01:03:38.565,01:03:40.525,"Okay, wearing dresses."
01:03:40.567,01:03:43.903,I was only wearing them because I thought that they were capes-- the dresses.
01:03:43.903,01:03:45.530,Are we recording this?
01:03:46.906,01:03:48.575,I had a really nice time tonight.
01:03:48.617,01:03:49.909,"Me, too."
01:03:49.909,01:03:52.912,I like that guy with the unibrow and the braces.
01:03:52.912,01:03:54.790,I actually...
01:03:54.914,01:03:56.916,I think I might like him more than I like you.
01:03:56.916,01:03:58.042,Mm.
01:03:58.084,01:03:59.503,"He likes you, too."
01:04:06.176,01:04:08.094,"I should, uh... I should go."
01:04:08.136,01:04:10.138,Yeah.
01:04:10.180,01:04:12.683,I should be a gentleman.
01:04:12.724,01:04:15.477,"Well, the good news is..."
01:04:15.519,01:04:16.936,I'm no gentleman.
01:04:19.939,01:04:21.149,This is not good.
01:04:37.957,01:04:39.751,"Oh, no."
01:05:03.483,01:05:05.068,FDR: Hey.
01:05:06.027,01:05:08.154,"Oh, my God. Okay..."
01:05:08.196,01:05:09.030,Morning.
01:05:09.072,01:05:10.866,Good morning.
01:05:10.990,01:05:12.450,You're dressed.
01:05:12.492,01:05:14.578,I have to go to work.
01:05:14.619,01:05:17.997,"I... oh, I thought maybe we could make pancakes or something."
01:05:17.997,01:05:18.998,"Uh, do you like pancakes?"
01:05:18.998,01:05:19.999,I love pancakes.
01:05:19.999,01:05:21.626,"Really, I would love to have pancakes."
01:05:21.668,01:05:23.837,Who doesn't like pancakes?
01:05:23.879,01:05:25.213,Crazy people.
01:05:25.255,01:05:30.761,"But I have to go to work 'cause I have a meeting really super early, so I got to go."
01:05:30.802,01:05:32.011,Yeah. Yeah.
01:05:32.053,01:05:33.346,"Yeah, no, that's-that's cool."
01:05:33.388,01:05:35.682,"I have a... I got a meeting, too, so... okay."
01:05:35.724,01:05:37.016,"But last night was, like..."
01:05:39.018,01:05:40.228,"...uh, was..."
01:05:40.270,01:05:43.648,Was it incredible?
01:05:43.690,01:05:44.649,That was crazy.
01:05:44.691,01:05:46.902,Yeah.
01:05:47.026,01:05:50.572,"Uh, thank you for the..."
01:05:50.614,01:05:53.408,Thank-thank you for... for that.
01:05:53.450,01:05:55.034,So I'm going to go.
01:05:55.034,01:05:57.621,"But, um, lock up behind you, or don't... I don't know."
01:05:57.662,01:05:59.790,"You're not going to steal anything, are you?"
01:05:59.831,01:06:01.040,I don't know why I said that.
01:06:01.082,01:06:02.667,"Okay, bye."
01:06:02.709,01:06:04.711,Good-bye.
01:06:06.045,01:06:07.213,Trish.
01:06:07.255,01:06:09.048,I slept with him.
01:06:09.048,01:06:10.926,TRISH: Which one?
01:06:11.050,01:06:12.176,"Oh, my God."
01:06:12.218,01:06:14.053,How do you feel?
01:06:14.053,01:06:16.055,Small hands not an issue.
01:06:16.097,01:06:18.057,I told you it wasn't going to be an issue!
01:06:18.057,01:06:19.392,How was it?
01:06:19.434,01:06:23.104,"Amazing-- like, five times amazing-- but I don't know what to do."
01:06:23.146,01:06:27.066,"I'm supposed to go meet Tuck this afternoon, but after last night, I-I can't see Tuck now."
01:06:27.066,01:06:29.653,"N-No! They do it to us all the time, okay?"
01:06:29.694,01:06:34.073,Do you think Gloria Steinem got arrested and sat in a jail cell so you could act like a little bitch?
01:06:34.073,01:06:35.074,I don't think so.
01:06:35.074,01:06:36.284,You get out there.
01:06:36.326,01:06:38.703,I think I'm going to hell.
01:06:38.745,01:06:41.623,"You're not going to hell, and if you go there, I'm... I'll be there to pick you up."
01:06:41.665,01:06:43.917,Okay. Save me a drink.
01:06:43.959,01:06:46.252,"TUCK: Boylee, have you got last night's surveillance tape, please?"
01:06:46.294,01:06:47.879,"Oh, hey."
01:06:47.921,01:06:50.674,"Um, we didn't get anything."
01:06:50.715,01:06:52.676,Got nothing.
01:06:52.717,01:06:55.303,"The tape jammed, so..."
01:06:56.972,01:06:58.974,"Boylee, it's digital, you plank."
01:06:59.098,01:07:00.976,"Mm, it... yeah."
01:07:01.100,01:07:02.560,So can I have the disc?
01:07:05.563,01:07:08.107,"Seriously, you..."
01:07:08.107,01:07:11.110,"I'll be the judge of that, thank you very much."
01:07:11.110,01:07:13.321,"Now, did you see this?"
01:07:14.405,01:07:15.699,Only once.
01:07:15.740,01:07:17.534,"Right, and what happened?"
01:07:17.575,01:07:20.119,Agent Foster entered the premises.
01:07:20.119,01:07:22.372,Right.
01:07:24.123,01:07:26.125,And?
01:07:26.125,01:07:27.752,Boylee.
01:07:29.128,01:07:31.130,Then he...
01:07:31.130,01:07:33.758,Then he entered the premises.
01:07:35.176,01:07:36.594,He pentrated...
01:07:36.636,01:07:38.137,"I got it, mate. Yeah, I totally understand, mate."
01:07:38.137,01:07:40.765,"Oh, thank you very much."
01:07:43.351,01:07:45.603,Open your eyes.
01:07:51.234,01:07:53.152,I'm flying.
01:07:53.194,01:07:55.154,Jack!
01:08:00.326,01:08:02.370,Hey.
01:08:02.412,01:08:04.414,Hi.
01:08:04.455,01:08:07.000,So... it's Tuesday.
01:08:07.042,01:08:08.001,Mm-hmm.
01:08:08.043,01:08:09.586,My layover day.
01:08:09.627,01:08:11.629,Yeah.
01:08:11.671,01:08:14.173,Right. Um...
01:08:14.215,01:08:15.717,"it's just, uh..."
01:08:15.759,01:08:16.927,"look, I..."
01:08:16.968,01:08:19.554,I can't really...
01:08:19.596,01:08:21.598,Um...
01:08:21.639,01:08:24.183,I met somebody.
01:08:24.183,01:08:25.810,Sorry.
01:08:28.271,01:08:30.189,Okay.
01:08:44.454,01:08:46.205,What's happening to me?
01:08:46.205,01:08:48.458,"You have absolutely no self-control, man."
01:08:48.499,01:08:51.210,"Tuck, look, I didn't plan on this happening."
01:08:51.210,01:08:52.754,Okay...
01:08:51.210,01:08:54.631,and she's the one that initiated it in the first place.
01:08:54.672,01:08:56.215,"Yeah, well, of course she initiated it."
01:08:56.215,01:08:57.759,"You rolled out the big, happy family."
01:08:57.801,01:08:59.385,That's girl...
01:08:59.427,01:09:00.637,"You broke the rules, man."
01:09:00.678,01:09:02.764,Forget about the rules.
01:09:02.806,01:09:03.974,I really care for Lauren.
01:09:04.015,01:09:05.224,"Oh, great."
01:09:05.266,01:09:06.810,Only took you 30 years.
01:09:06.851,01:09:08.061,Tuck.
01:09:08.103,01:09:09.228,I slept with her.
01:09:09.228,01:09:11.648,"Yeah, well, I'm well aware of that, aren't I?"
01:09:11.689,01:09:13.566,"No, slept-- fell asleep."
01:09:13.608,01:09:17.070,That's never happened to me before.
01:09:24.243,01:09:26.663,"Hey, spudley, how you doing?"
01:09:26.704,01:09:27.789,Come on.
01:09:30.959,01:09:32.752,This is my friend Lauren.
01:09:33.962,01:09:36.255,I thought Uncle Frank was your only friend.
01:09:36.255,01:09:37.799,Who's Uncle Frank?
01:09:39.258,01:09:42.595,"TUCK: Uh, he's right."
01:09:42.637,01:09:44.139,He is my only friend from work.
01:09:44.263,01:09:47.725,"But, uh, this is my new friend Lauren."
01:09:47.767,01:09:50.103,Hi.
01:09:50.145,01:09:52.313,"Hey, what are you two doing this afternoon?"
01:09:52.355,01:09:56.317,"'Cause I need some help with work, and I think you could be the men for the job."
01:09:56.359,01:09:58.277,JOE: Yeah?
01:10:11.290,01:10:12.709,Hands up.
01:10:20.299,01:10:22.510,Go to... go to...
01:10:23.302,01:10:25.138,"Bye, Lauren."
01:10:29.308,01:10:31.268,Hello.
01:10:31.310,01:10:33.897,Hello.
01:10:37.316,01:10:38.902,He just used the kid.
01:10:38.943,01:10:41.529,He used the kid.
01:10:41.571,01:10:44.782,"Maybe we could get you a kid, sir, for a day."
01:10:44.824,01:10:46.201,You know a guy?
01:10:46.242,01:10:47.326,I know a guy.
01:10:47.368,01:10:48.661,No.
01:10:59.130,01:11:01.298,TUCK: I had a really fantastic day today.
01:11:01.340,01:11:03.968,"Thank you very, very much."
01:11:05.344,01:11:07.388,Good night.
01:11:25.782,01:11:27.366,Go inside.
01:11:27.366,01:11:29.744,"You-you-you-you don't want to see... Oh, my God."
01:11:35.625,01:11:36.793,Bring up five.
01:11:40.046,01:11:41.965,Where did they go? Bring up three. Bring up three.
01:11:45.384,01:11:47.386,"Tuck, we need to talk."
01:11:47.386,01:11:48.554,Yeah?
01:11:48.596,01:11:50.807,In a little bit.
01:11:52.391,01:11:53.810,"It's dead, sir."
01:11:53.851,01:11:55.853,Bring up four!
01:11:55.895,01:11:57.981,This is so bad.
01:11:58.022,01:12:00.399,But it feels so good.
01:12:02.693,01:12:04.403,"We're dead, sir."
01:12:13.412,01:12:14.413,"Okay, Tuck."
01:12:14.413,01:12:16.958,"Tuck, Tuck, Tuck, I'm sorry."
01:12:17.000,01:12:19.252,I'm not this kind of girl.
01:12:21.087,01:12:24.174,TUCK: I know exactly what kind of girl you are.
01:12:24.215,01:12:27.885,And that's why I've completely fallen in love with you.
01:12:29.929,01:12:31.430,Damn.
01:12:31.430,01:12:35.476,"I think that's the new British invasion, what just happened there."
01:12:37.436,01:12:39.814,I feel like I'm having a panic attack.
01:12:39.856,01:12:41.232,"Okay, well, just breathe."
01:12:41.274,01:12:43.860,"Breathe in and breathe out, and come sit down."
01:12:43.901,01:12:48.614,Do you think it's possible to love two people equally?
01:12:50.241,01:12:52.327,"Love, yes."
01:12:52.451,01:12:55.454,"Be in love, no."
01:12:56.497,01:12:58.708,What do you do when you don't know what to do?
01:12:58.749,01:13:00.626,I ask Bob.
01:13:00.668,01:13:02.461,Your husband Bob?
01:13:02.461,01:13:03.796,Bob Bob?
01:13:03.838,01:13:14.265,"Yeah. I mean, I know he's fat and ridiculous, but he's my fat and my ridiculous, and I like the way that I am with him."
01:13:14.307,01:13:15.308,"Mom, can you fix this?"
01:13:15.350,01:13:16.475,"Hey, buddy."
01:13:18.895,01:13:20.646,Don't choose the better guy.
01:13:20.688,01:13:24.234,Choose the guy that's going to make you the better girl.
01:13:24.275,01:13:25.484,Right?
01:13:25.526,01:13:27.486,BOY: Right.
01:13:27.486,01:13:29.488,I love you?
01:13:29.488,01:13:31.699,Pretty fancy words to get the girl in bed.
01:13:31.741,01:13:33.326,Bravo. Well done.
01:13:33.368,01:13:34.493,Good performance.
01:13:34.493,01:13:35.953,"Yeah, I didn't expect you to understand that."
01:13:35.995,01:13:38.081,Why can't you just admit you lost?
01:13:38.122,01:13:42.043,"I didn't lose. I was doing really well, actually, until you turned up with your big hair and your..."
01:13:42.085,01:13:43.627,"all of white teeth, as per usual."
01:13:43.669,01:13:45.963,"And let's not forget, yes, sir, I did find her first."
01:13:46.005,01:13:47.924,"Yeah, but she..."
01:13:47.965,01:13:49.717,She fell for me.
01:13:49.759,01:13:52.053,It's not my fault you're always a step behind.
01:13:52.095,01:13:54.555,"If I'm only a step behind, it's because I'm cleaning up after you."
01:13:59.518,01:14:02.105,Do you know what?
01:14:02.146,01:14:05.524,I couldn't give a monkey's who Lauren chooses between us.
01:14:06.317,01:14:09.528,"But this, what we had..."
01:14:09.528,01:14:10.529,"Yeah, what?"
01:14:10.529,01:14:12.531,It's over.
01:14:13.574,01:14:15.534,I already asked Collins for a transfer.
01:14:21.332,01:14:23.126,Lauren.
01:14:23.167,01:14:25.002,How are you? Are you well?
01:14:25.044,01:14:26.712,Good.
01:14:26.754,01:14:28.172,"No, no, I'm just at work."
01:14:28.214,01:14:29.548,"Oh, yeah? What are you doing?"
01:14:29.548,01:14:30.549,"Oh, nothing much."
01:14:30.549,01:14:31.592,"Bit boring, to be honest."
01:14:31.634,01:14:33.552,Do you know that new place on Third?
01:14:33.552,01:14:35.430,"Oh, I do. I do."
01:14:35.554,01:14:36.555,Can you meet me there?
01:14:36.555,01:14:38.349,I can be there in about half an hour.
01:14:38.391,01:14:39.558,"Okay, I'll see you for lunch then."
01:14:39.558,01:14:40.559,That would be lovely.
01:14:40.601,01:14:42.103,All right. I'll see you there.
01:14:42.145,01:14:43.020,"All right, my love."
01:14:43.062,01:14:44.605,Bye.
01:14:47.566,01:14:49.568,She called you.
01:14:53.281,01:14:55.450,"Gotta go, mate."
01:14:56.284,01:14:58.286,I have to pack up anyway.
01:15:13.968,01:15:16.471,Lucky water bottle.
01:15:18.764,01:15:20.057,What are you doing?
01:15:20.099,01:15:22.810,Just watching last night's surveillance video on Tuck.
01:15:22.852,01:15:24.395,"Time to close the books on that one, Dickerman."
01:15:24.437,01:15:25.604,She got away.
01:15:28.858,01:15:30.609,"All right, Dick."
01:15:30.651,01:15:33.612,I'll see you when I see you.
01:15:33.612,01:15:35.490,TUCK: I had a really fantastic day today.
01:15:35.614,01:15:37.741,"Thank you very, very much."
01:15:37.783,01:15:39.035,LAUREN: It was fun.
01:15:39.076,01:15:41.620,"TUCK: It was. I, uh..."
01:15:41.620,01:15:43.873,S-Scroll back for a second.
01:15:43.914,01:15:45.291,"LAUREN: Yeah, so..."
01:15:45.333,01:15:47.251,Now zoom in.
01:15:47.293,01:15:49.670,"No, no, no."
01:15:51.005,01:15:53.132,Freeze that and enhance.
01:15:57.470,01:15:59.638,That's Heinrich.
01:16:01.432,01:16:03.851,He's here.
01:16:03.893,01:16:05.644,I'm really glad you called.
01:16:05.644,01:16:08.647,"I didn't expect you to, actually."
01:16:08.647,01:16:10.649,It was a surprise.
01:16:10.649,01:16:12.651,"Yeah, which is great because I love surprises."
01:16:12.693,01:16:13.819,"You do? Gosh, I don't."
01:16:13.861,01:16:16.072,"Usually, they turn out more bad than..."
01:16:16.906,01:16:17.990,Good grief.
01:16:18.032,01:16:19.450,Hi.
01:16:19.492,01:16:21.285,"FDR, uh, what are you..."
01:16:21.327,01:16:22.661,"Um, I'm sorry."
01:16:22.661,01:16:25.122,"Tuck, this is my friend FDR."
01:16:25.164,01:16:27.500,"FDR, this is Tuck."
01:16:27.542,01:16:28.667,Lovely to meet you.
01:16:29.668,01:16:30.711,Are you British?
01:16:30.753,01:16:32.088,"Yes, I am."
01:16:32.129,01:16:33.672,That's a crying shame.
01:16:33.672,01:16:36.050,Why?
01:16:36.092,01:16:40.012,"You have... you have very gentle hands, don't you?"
01:16:40.054,01:16:40.930,Strong hands.
01:16:40.971,01:16:42.515,Gentle hands.
01:16:42.557,01:16:43.682,Gentle hands.
01:16:43.724,01:16:45.684,Can you excuse me for just a second?
01:16:45.684,01:16:46.727,"I'm just going to, um..."
01:16:46.769,01:16:50.689,"just, um, I'll just..."
01:16:51.690,01:16:54.485,"Order me a drink, um, and a shot."
01:16:54.527,01:16:56.862,I'll be right back.
01:17:03.702,01:17:05.246,Hello?
01:17:05.288,01:17:06.705,They're both here.
01:17:06.705,01:17:08.458,You've got to get over here.
01:17:08.499,01:17:10.709,"I told you, you shouldn't date two guys at the same time."
01:17:10.709,01:17:12.711,What?
01:17:12.711,01:17:16.090,"What, you have neither the grace nor the humility to lose like a man, do you?"
01:17:16.132,01:17:17.133,It's Heinrich.
01:17:17.174,01:17:18.551,He's in L.A.
01:17:18.593,01:17:19.760,We have to get on it right now.
01:17:19.802,01:17:21.137,Do you know what?
01:17:21.178,01:17:23.264,"No, really, you are. I have to take my hat off to you."
01:17:23.306,01:17:25.349,This is very impressive.
01:17:25.391,01:17:27.726,You have to listen to me.
01:17:27.726,01:17:29.103,This is not...
01:17:29.145,01:17:30.729,"Take your hand off me, mate."
01:17:30.729,01:17:32.731,Yeah?
01:17:34.525,01:17:35.776,"Yeah, all right."
01:17:35.818,01:17:37.945,Where you going?
01:17:37.987,01:17:39.947,Hmm?
01:17:54.837,01:17:56.213,"Okay, you can do this."
01:17:56.255,01:17:58.757,You are a confident woman who can deal with conflict.
01:17:58.757,01:18:00.759,Think I'm going to pass out.
01:18:00.759,01:18:02.761,Has that been on my teeth the whole time?
01:18:04.472,01:18:06.223,Get out there.
01:18:06.265,01:18:07.766,Tell them your decision.
01:18:07.766,01:18:08.767,They're rational.
01:18:10.769,01:18:12.021,They may even become friends.
01:18:14.773,01:18:16.025,They'll probably just shake hands.
01:18:19.362,01:18:21.989,My boobs are sweating.
01:18:30.789,01:18:32.333,Hmm.
01:18:36.671,01:18:40.966,I should have killed you in Kandahar when I had the chance.
01:18:41.008,01:18:44.011,"Well, you're having a laugh, mate."
01:18:44.053,01:18:47.640,"TUCK: I was the only thing keeping you alive in Kandahar, mate."
01:18:47.682,01:18:49.225,I was your only friend.
01:18:49.266,01:18:51.435,Friend?
01:18:53.020,01:18:54.647,You two know each other?
01:18:54.689,01:18:55.814,"Well, Lauren..."
01:18:55.814,01:18:56.815,You two know each other?
01:18:56.857,01:18:58.817,Yes.
01:18:58.859,01:19:00.695,"What was this, some sort of bet?"
01:19:00.819,01:19:02.821,"What, to see who could get the girl first?"
01:19:02.821,01:19:03.864,"No, no, no."
01:19:03.906,01:19:05.700,No. Let me explain.
01:19:05.824,01:19:10.663,"I'm really... no, actually, you've done more than enough."
01:19:10.705,01:19:12.831,I trusted you.
01:19:15.834,01:19:17.461,Laur... Lauren!
01:19:21.840,01:19:23.050,It's worse than I thought.
01:19:23.092,01:19:24.176,They know each other.
01:19:24.218,01:19:25.678,What?
01:19:25.720,01:19:28.431,"I-I walked in, and they said they were friends or something."
01:19:28.472,01:19:29.848,"Here, drink this."
01:19:32.851,01:19:34.228,"Oh, my God. What is that?"
01:19:34.270,01:19:35.688,It's a screwdriver.
01:19:35.730,01:19:40.276,"I mean, it's mostly vodka, but I'm sure there's some apple juice or something in there from somewhere."
01:19:40.317,01:19:41.694,like an idiot.
01:19:41.736,01:19:42.653,I thought they cared about me.
01:19:42.695,01:19:43.862,Can we just get out of here?
01:19:43.862,01:19:45.448,"Yeah, sure, we could just go to a bar..."
01:19:45.489,01:19:47.283,"Oh, my God."
01:19:48.242,01:19:49.702,"Oh, my God."
01:19:49.744,01:19:51.203,What... what did...
01:19:51.245,01:19:52.705,Excuse me.
01:19:52.747,01:19:54.873,Is there something I can help you with?
01:19:54.873,01:19:57.418,Just give him your keys.
01:19:57.460,01:19:59.878,I want your boyfriends.
01:20:02.548,01:20:04.216,"Don't talk to me, mate."
01:20:04.258,01:20:06.802,"In fact, don't ever talk to me again. Don't..."
01:20:10.556,01:20:12.057,Is that Sade?
01:20:12.099,01:20:13.850,"Sade is not exclusive, my friend."
01:20:13.892,01:20:15.060,Jesus.
01:20:15.102,01:20:16.437,Ah. Look.
01:20:16.479,01:20:18.439,FDR: Put her on speaker.
01:20:18.481,01:20:19.856,All right.
01:20:19.898,01:20:20.857,"Hi, Lauren."
01:20:20.899,01:20:22.276,"I'm really, really sorry about what happened."
01:20:22.318,01:20:23.736,That was an awful...
01:20:23.778,01:20:25.112,I am so sorry about what happened.
01:20:25.154,01:20:26.863,Will you just be quiet?
01:20:26.905,01:20:28.865,"Please, she called me."
01:20:28.907,01:20:30.451,"Why-why didn't she call your phone, then?"
01:20:30.493,01:20:32.453,I don't know.
01:20:32.495,01:20:34.121,You shut up. Lauren...
01:20:34.163,01:20:36.457,"HEINRICH: No, you shut up."
01:20:36.499,01:20:43.880,"You two come alone, unarmed, to Warehouse 22 in San Pedro, or I'll have to kill your pretty girlfriend and her friend."
01:20:43.922,01:20:48.678,"I see any police, any agent within a mile, you get her head in the mail."
01:20:48.719,01:20:49.970,Be there in an hour.
01:20:50.012,01:20:53.890,"We go to that warehouse, she's not walking out, and neither are we."
01:20:53.932,01:20:55.267,What-what-what...
01:20:55.309,01:20:57.102,GPS. I put a sat-tracker on her.
01:20:57.144,01:20:58.187,You put a sat-tracker on her?
01:20:58.228,01:20:59.896,"Yeah, of course I did."
01:20:59.938,01:21:00.897,"No, of course I didn't."
01:21:00.939,01:21:02.065,I didn't put a sat-tracker on her.
01:21:02.107,01:21:03.108,That's completely immoral.
01:21:03.150,01:21:04.694,I put one on her cell phone.
01:21:04.735,01:21:06.945,"Steal this car, Tuck."
01:21:08.447,01:21:10.157,Thank you.
01:21:10.199,01:21:11.325,Try not to screw this up.
01:21:11.367,01:21:12.951,You try not to screw this up.
01:21:12.951,01:21:13.952,Stop repeating everything that I say!
01:21:13.952,01:21:16.955,"BOTHWICK: FDR, target is holding steady."
01:21:16.955,01:21:18.290,One mile to contact.
01:21:18.332,01:21:20.959,"Uh, Tuck, negative-- point-eight miles, to be precise."
01:21:25.214,01:21:26.716,"All right, get me close."
01:21:26.757,01:21:27.966,I'm going to pull a Monte Carlo.
01:21:27.966,01:21:29.176,That's a negative.
01:21:29.218,01:21:30.969,You're going to have to do a reverse Karachi.
01:21:30.969,01:21:32.847,Fine. Just get me close.
01:21:40.437,01:21:42.606,TRISH: Aah!
01:21:43.982,01:21:45.984,No! What are you doing? No!
01:21:47.820,01:21:48.863,Trish!
01:21:48.987,01:21:50.781,TUCK: Got it!
01:21:56.286,01:21:59.623,Shit...!
01:22:19.017,01:22:21.019,Drive you idiot!
01:22:27.443,01:22:28.903,What the hell is going on?
01:22:29.027,01:22:30.153,"I'm going to be honest with you, Lauren."
01:22:30.195,01:22:31.363,I am not a travel agent.
01:22:31.405,01:22:32.239,Really?
01:22:32.281,01:22:33.616,I'm not a cruise ship captain.
01:22:33.657,01:22:34.617,No shit!
01:22:36.034,01:22:38.078,"Ow! Oh, my God!"
01:22:38.120,01:22:41.039,"LAUREN: Oh, my God."
01:22:41.039,01:22:42.291,"Grab the wheel, please."
01:22:42.332,01:22:43.417,I've seen you drive.
01:22:43.459,01:22:44.460,I'm not going to drive the car!
01:22:44.501,01:22:46.128,"Oh! Oh, God."
01:22:47.045,01:22:48.714,Turn around.
01:22:48.756,01:22:51.174,Shit!
01:22:51.216,01:22:53.469,Tuck!
01:22:59.433,01:23:01.101,I missed you.
01:23:01.143,01:23:02.645,"I've missed you, too."
01:23:02.686,01:23:04.480,"I love you, man."
01:23:04.521,01:23:06.064,FDR: We're back!
01:23:06.064,01:23:07.900,I'm Yoko.
01:23:16.325,01:23:19.077,I'm Susan Walsh coming to you live from the studio...
01:23:19.077,01:23:19.912,Mom?
01:23:19.954,01:23:21.497,...with this breaking news story.
01:23:21.538,01:23:24.625,Is that Dad?
01:23:24.667,01:23:25.876,Where the hell are they going?
01:23:25.918,01:23:27.670,Headed south on the 310 freeway.
01:23:27.711,01:23:30.088,But that freeway's incomplete.
01:23:32.090,01:23:33.091,"300 feet, 200 feet..."
01:23:33.133,01:23:34.927,They're running out of road.
01:24:03.288,01:24:05.749,"I hope you can forgive him, Lauren."
01:24:05.791,01:24:07.459,He's the best man I know.
01:24:07.501,01:24:08.669,"Oh, bollocks, mate."
01:24:08.711,01:24:10.379,The pair of you-- you two belong to each other.
01:24:10.420,01:24:12.172,You really do. You belong to each other.
01:24:12.214,01:24:14.508,"No, thank you, Tuck, but she's already made her choice."
01:24:14.550,01:24:16.593,"No. No, I didn't."
01:24:16.635,01:24:18.971,BOTH: You didn't?
01:24:20.138,01:24:21.306,What?
01:24:21.348,01:24:22.892,"No, I-I mean, I did, but..."
01:24:22.933,01:24:26.144,"in light of everything I just found out, I-I feel..."
01:24:26.144,01:24:27.354,Tuck.
01:24:37.573,01:24:39.157,It's bulletproof!
01:24:39.157,01:24:40.617,The lights!
01:24:41.451,01:24:42.828,Shoot the headlights!
01:24:42.870,01:24:46.164,Front impact air bag deployment in all models after 2006.
01:25:24.494,01:25:25.996,"Oh, my God..."
01:25:29.249,01:25:30.417,You okay?
01:25:30.459,01:25:32.210,Good.
01:25:34.296,01:25:37.215,I'm okay.
01:25:48.894,01:25:50.896,"Yeah, all right, get a room."
01:25:55.233,01:25:57.486,we do not know how it started...
01:25:57.527,01:25:59.237,I don't think he's a travel agent.
01:25:59.237,01:26:03.826,...but it may have involved a German terrorist group as well as two federal agents.
01:26:05.327,01:26:07.370,"Want to let me take a look at that, sir?"
01:26:07.412,01:26:09.957,"No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I..."
01:26:17.089,01:26:18.256,I was going to tell you.
01:26:18.256,01:26:19.633,That's why I asked you out.
01:26:19.675,01:26:21.885,Yeah. It's okay.
01:26:21.927,01:26:23.137,"I, um..."
01:26:24.262,01:26:26.264,"That's good, that's good; I-I understand."
01:26:26.264,01:26:28.475,Okay.
01:26:30.435,01:26:32.270,Does Joe know about this?
01:26:32.312,01:26:36.274,Um... no.
01:26:36.274,01:26:38.694,"No, not yet, but I think he will do in a minute."
01:26:38.735,01:26:41.279,All right.
01:26:42.865,01:26:47.285,"I should, I should probably..."
01:26:47.285,01:26:48.912,Okay.
01:26:50.914,01:26:51.957,Good.
01:26:51.999,01:26:53.291,Take care.
01:26:53.333,01:26:55.293,"Hey, Tuck..."
01:26:58.588,01:27:03.552,"I'll, uh... take care of all this."
01:27:03.593,01:27:05.971,Thank you.
01:27:06.013,01:27:08.306,All right.
01:27:08.306,01:27:11.060,"I'll see you, I'll see you in the office?"
01:27:11.101,01:27:13.311,No.
01:27:15.313,01:27:18.192,"I'll see you in the field, mate."
01:27:18.316,01:27:19.568,"Come here, you, come here."
01:27:19.609,01:27:20.903,"Come here, you."
01:27:20.944,01:27:21.945,I love you.
01:27:21.987,01:27:23.197,"I love you, too."
01:27:23.321,01:27:25.074,You're family always and forever.
01:27:25.115,01:27:27.034,"Yeah, so are you."
01:27:28.702,01:27:30.328,Take care.
01:27:30.328,01:27:31.538,Take care of her.
01:27:33.373,01:27:35.375,So...
01:27:35.417,01:27:41.339,"So, when I added it all up and I crunched all the numbers, it was a..."
01:27:55.353,01:27:57.981,"You're gonna make me regret this, aren't you?"
01:27:58.023,01:28:00.358,For the rest of your life.
01:28:15.373,01:28:16.374,Dad!
01:28:16.374,01:28:18.752,"No, don't tap."
01:28:19.962,01:28:21.713,Did you see that?
01:28:21.755,01:28:23.173,"It worked, you see that?"
01:28:23.215,01:28:24.216,"What'd I tell you, hmm?"
01:28:24.258,01:28:25.383,You happy?
01:28:25.425,01:28:27.594,"Come on, go get your sneakers, go on."
01:28:27.636,01:28:28.595,"You-you're not, you're not listening to me."
01:28:28.637,01:28:30.180,"Mate, can I have a quick word with you?"
01:28:30.222,01:28:31.389,"No, it's..."
01:28:31.431,01:28:33.391,"Aw, that's it, stand up."
01:28:35.685,01:28:39.189,"I believe a man once said to me, Pain is weakness leaving the body."
01:28:41.191,01:28:42.151,"Bye, weakness."
01:28:42.192,01:28:45.946,Weakness leaving the body.
01:28:45.988,01:28:48.782,"You go on, talk to your friends for a bit."
01:28:51.994,01:28:55.038,Hey.
01:28:57.124,01:28:58.834,So you're not a travel agent?
01:28:58.875,01:29:00.669,No.
01:29:00.710,01:29:02.045,Hmm.
01:29:02.087,01:29:05.423,"Um, th-this is me."
01:29:10.804,01:29:14.016,"Hi, um, I'm Katie."
01:29:16.226,01:29:18.812,"Hello, Katie, I'm, uh, I'm Tuck."
01:29:18.854,01:29:19.855,Pleased to meet you.
01:29:19.896,01:29:21.439,Tuck?
01:29:21.439,01:29:22.774,Yeah.
01:29:22.816,01:29:24.567,Finally.
01:29:24.609,01:29:26.444,You hungry?
01:29:26.444,01:29:27.904,"Yes, I am."
01:29:27.946,01:29:31.783,"Well, you want to get some dinner..."
01:29:31.825,01:29:33.243,as a family?
01:29:33.285,01:29:35.037,"Yes, yes, I would."
01:29:35.078,01:29:37.706,"Okay, good."
01:29:40.834,01:29:43.461,"Okay, bud, time to go."
01:30:03.481,01:30:04.816,Hello!
01:30:04.858,01:30:07.485,"LAUREN: Hey, babe!"
01:30:07.527,01:30:09.445,"You're using the vector chute, right?"
01:30:09.487,01:30:11.447,"Yeah, of course!"
01:30:09.487,01:30:13.449,It's got high tensile fiber and triple secure locking features.
01:30:13.491,01:30:15.369,It gets fives across the board.
01:30:15.409,01:30:17.662,"Oh, God, I love it when you talk dirty!"
01:30:18.580,01:30:19.873,"Oh, Nana's tomorrow night."
01:30:19.915,01:30:22.542,Don't forget to tell Tuck to bring Katie and Joe.
01:30:22.584,01:30:24.336,"Hey, Nana's tomorrow night, huh?"
01:30:24.378,01:30:26.129,Is that Nana you're talking to?
01:30:26.171,01:30:27.881,No.
01:30:27.923,01:30:29.549,Did you tell him yet?
01:30:29.591,01:30:32.052,I'm just about to.
01:30:32.094,01:30:33.178,Good luck.
01:30:33.220,01:30:35.638,"I love you, baby."
01:30:35.680,01:30:36.848,Bye.
01:30:36.890,01:30:37.766,Ah!
01:30:36.890,01:30:39.351,I'm gonna throw you the best bachelorette party ever!
01:30:39.393,01:30:41.477,Are you sure that we should do this?
01:30:41.519,01:30:46.316,"Have I ever, ever, ever steered you wrong?"
01:30:47.025,01:30:48.402,Brother.
01:30:48.484,01:30:49.485,I asked Lauren to marry me.
01:30:49.527,01:30:51.113,Will you be my best man?
01:30:55.158,01:30:56.701,Jump run!
01:30:56.743,01:30:59.288,"Hey, you're good."
01:30:59.329,01:31:03.333,"I know it's a little awkward with you having slept with her and everything, but..."
01:31:03.375,01:31:04.918,"Yeah, don't worry about it, Lauren didn't even sleep..."
01:31:04.960,01:31:07.879,"I just, I just think it's poetic justice, right?"
01:31:07.921,01:31:09.089,"Well, what is?"
01:31:09.131,01:31:13.551,"Well, I've been meaning to tell you this for a while, but..."
01:31:13.551,01:31:16.554,I slept with Katie-- once.
01:31:16.554,01:31:18.974,"It was a long time ago, before you guys even knew each other."
01:31:19.015,01:31:20.434,"No, wait, you slept with my wife?!"
01:31:20.558,01:31:22.352,"No, she wasn't your wife!"
01:31:22.394,01:31:23.561,You slept with my wife?!
01:31:23.561,01:31:24.562,"It was a long time ago, man."
01:31:24.562,01:31:26.731,I-I never even slept with Lauren!
01:31:26.773,01:31:27.899,What?!
01:31:27.941,01:31:30.568,I never slept with Lauren!
01:31:31.820,01:31:36.199,"No, I only let you think that-- Right? Think that-- to make you jealous!"
01:31:36.241,01:31:37.951,You never slept with Lauren?!
01:31:37.993,01:31:39.577,You slept with my wi...!
