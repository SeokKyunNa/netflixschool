00:00:17.350,00:00:34.075,"And all I can do is sit and twiddle, which is what I call my self-stimulatory behavior, when I flick a pencil against a rubber band at a certain frequency and think about all the things that I could never do, like research penguins in Antarctica or have a girlfriend."
00:00:34.159,00:00:36.995,I don't know. I'd like to go to Antarctica.
00:00:37.746,00:00:38.872,It's quiet there...
00:00:39.831,00:00:42.208,"except in the rookeries, where the penguins breed."
00:00:45.628,00:00:47.088,I'm finished with my answer.
00:00:48.131,00:00:49.215,Great.
00:00:49.299,00:00:51.718,"Almost done for today. Good session, Sam."
00:00:51.801,00:00:53.970,I can see your bra. It's purple.
00:00:57.223,00:01:01.061,"Um, there was one more thing I wanted to discuss."
00:01:01.144,00:01:07.984,"And I don't need your answer now, but I'm asking all my clients if they'd be willing to donate their brains for research."
00:01:09.694,00:01:10.945,Donate my brain?
00:01:11.696,00:01:13.865,-After you die. -Oh.
00:01:13.948,00:01:19.829,"Yeah. There's such a shortage of brain matter available, and, you know, there's no substitute for the real thing."
00:01:21.081,00:01:23.249,Just think about it.
00:01:24.292,00:01:29.923,"-Okay. -And, hey, Sam, what you said earlier about having a girlfriend?"
00:01:30.507,00:01:32.383,"People in the spectrum date, you know?"
00:01:32.467,00:01:36.137,"You can try to find someone, if you wanted to."
00:01:36.679,00:01:39.182,-How? -You just have to put yourself out there.
00:01:40.141,00:01:41.184,Out where?
00:01:45.104,00:01:49.859,"but I don't like the feeling of the seat on my back, so I sit like this."
00:01:49.943,00:01:51.653,I don't know how people stand it.
00:01:51.736,00:01:55.281,Maybe they've developed thicker back skin from riding the bus so much.
00:01:55.365,00:02:01.037,There's a type of Antarctic cod that has a special protein in its blood that stops it from freezing.
00:02:08.169,00:02:10.547,I was just thinking about Antarctic cod.
00:02:13.758,00:02:16.970,Antarctica is the most remote continent on the planet.
00:02:19.430,00:02:25.687,"It has 90% of the world's ice, but it's considered a desert because the annual rainfall is only about eight inches."
00:02:26.396,00:02:29.232,You wouldn't think it was a desert when you looked at it.
00:02:30.567,00:02:31.943,That's why I like it.
00:02:33.319,00:02:34.863,It's not what it looks like.
00:02:38.241,00:02:41.578,"So, I ordered those T-shirts that Sam likes, in bulk..."
00:02:41.661,00:02:43.454,"you know, 100% cotton..."
00:02:43.538,00:02:48.001,and they switched them to something that they called tri-blend.
00:02:48.084,00:02:52.422,"So I called the company, and I spoke to this woman named Rizwana."
00:02:52.505,00:02:54.424,I think I was speaking with India.
00:02:55.675,00:02:57.260,"But, anyway, um..."
00:02:57.343,00:03:02.724,"And she found a box of the old ones, and they sent them free of charge."
00:03:05.184,00:03:07.061,"Wow. That is a great story, Mom."
00:03:07.145,00:03:08.438,"Oh, don't be a dick, honey."
00:03:08.521,00:03:11.149,"So, Sam, how was your session with Julia today?"
00:03:11.232,00:03:14.444,"She wants me to donate my brain, but don't worry, it's after I die."
00:03:14.527,00:03:17.447,"What, like, for research? That could be kind of cool."
00:03:17.530,00:03:18.531,Absolutely not.
00:03:19.198,00:03:20.825,And the queen has spoken.
00:03:20.909,00:03:23.077,"Well, it's gross, Casey."
00:03:23.161,00:03:26.039,"You tell Julia, Thank you, but no."
00:03:28.416,00:03:30.585,I don't care what happens to my dead brain.
00:03:30.668,00:03:33.171,"It's either I give it to Julia, or maggots eat it."
00:03:33.254,00:03:35.089,"If Mom wants maggots to eat it, fine."
00:03:35.173,00:03:37.467,"No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying."
00:03:37.550,00:03:38.551,Kind of is.
00:03:38.635,00:03:40.220,I don't care. I'll be dead.
00:03:40.303,00:03:43.431,Can we stop talking about you being dead? You're not going anywhere.
00:03:43.514,00:03:45.141,"Wow, this chicken's really good, honey."
00:03:45.266,00:03:46.851,Thanks. It's a dry rub.
00:03:46.935,00:03:48.144,It's a good dry rub.
00:03:48.811,00:03:53.316,Julia thinks that I should put myself out there and find someone to have sex with.
00:03:54.859,00:03:56.778,She didn't say the sex part. I added that.
00:04:36.442,00:04:42.490,"and it smells weird, but it has one thing going for it: it has lots of girls."
00:04:42.573,00:04:50.164,"Well, I think every girl is pretty in her own way, like a snowflake in a seasonal Antarctic storm."
00:05:13.730,00:05:14.689,Thank you.
00:05:17.775,00:05:19.944,Banged a veterinarian I met online last night.
00:05:20.028,00:05:22.613,She had a pet parrot that repeated everything she said.
00:05:22.697,00:05:25.908,"Do me, Brown Sugar! Do me, Brown Sugar!"
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.244,"Oh, shit. I think she's racist."
00:05:29.454,00:05:30.455,What kind of parrot?
00:05:30.538,00:05:33.124,"Oh, I don't know. The red rainbow one?"
00:05:33.207,00:05:35.543,-That's a scarlet macaw. -Oh.
00:05:41.507,00:05:42.550,Zahid...
00:05:43.676,00:05:44.886,do you like dating girls?
00:05:46.304,00:05:48.264,"Yeah, dude. I like dating girls."
00:05:54.520,00:05:55.605,What are you doing?
00:05:55.688,00:05:58.191,Going online to try and find a girl to date.
00:05:58.274,00:05:59.734,That's hilarious. I'll help.
00:06:01.694,00:06:05.323,"Okay, finish this sentence: I spend a lot of time thinking about..."
00:06:05.406,00:06:06.657,Easy. Penguins.
00:06:06.741,00:06:09.535,"And, especially, I'll say chinstrap penguins."
00:06:09.619,00:06:14.123,"They're my favorite bird, but all four types of Antarctic penguins are good."
00:06:14.207,00:06:18.252,Did you know early explorers thought they were fish and classified them that way?
00:06:18.336,00:06:20.088,"Not birds, fish."
00:06:22.590,00:06:23.841,I'm gonna put sports.
00:06:25.218,00:06:26.469,What you doing?
00:06:26.552,00:06:30.681,"Casey's helping me sign up for online dating, but hates all my answers, so she's lying."
00:06:32.642,00:06:34.477,-Wow. -Mm-hmm.
00:06:34.560,00:06:36.145,You're a little young for that.
00:06:36.229,00:06:38.940,"You know, I saw an episode on 20/20."
00:06:39.023,00:06:45.571,"There's actually something called catfishing, -and it has nothing to do with fishing. -Bye, Mom."
00:06:48.491,00:06:50.660,Should we take another picture with Edison?
00:06:50.743,00:06:53.621,I read online that girls love animals.
00:06:53.704,00:06:54.831,Maybe like this?
00:06:55.790,00:06:58.459,I think this might go quicker if you just leave.
00:07:03.381,00:07:05.174,Careful. What are you doing?
00:07:05.258,00:07:06.717,"Honey, can you get that for me?"
00:07:08.678,00:07:10.763,-Which one? -Three to five.
00:07:11.764,00:07:13.975,"This room, it's, like, so disorganized."
00:07:14.934,00:07:16.477,-Such a mess. -You okay?
00:07:16.561,00:07:18.312,"Yes, fine. Totally fine."
00:07:19.313,00:07:20.231,Yeah.
00:07:21.149,00:07:23.818,"Sam's gonna start dating, so that's something."
00:07:23.901,00:07:25.194,Do you remember these?
00:07:25.278,00:07:26.988,-Sam's emotion cards? -Yeah.
00:07:27.071,00:07:31.033,"Someone's making this face, they might be sad, so you should try to be kind to them."
00:07:31.117,00:07:36.706,"A woman in the support group, her son was just diagnosed, so I said I'd throw some things together."
00:07:36.789,00:07:39.959,This was the exact face he made when I surprised him with Mets tickets.
00:07:40.042,00:07:41.919,"-Remember that? -Yeah, I do."
00:07:42.003,00:07:45.173,I wanted us to just have one thing in common.
00:07:45.256,00:07:46.466,Just one thing.
00:07:47.550,00:07:50.470,Me and my dad used to go to the ball games all the time.
00:07:52.180,00:07:54.474,I think it's all right that Sam's gonna try to date.
00:07:54.557,00:07:58.978,"I mean, you and I weren't much older when we met, and that was fun, right? We had a good time."
00:07:59.061,00:08:02.023,"-Sam's not like us. -I know, but he has to start..."
00:08:02.106,00:08:04.108,"Do you know that every time the phone rings, I jump?"
00:08:04.692,00:08:06.152,Every time.
00:08:06.944,00:08:09.655,I think he's crossed the street again with his eyes closed...
00:08:10.531,00:08:15.870,or he had a freak-out in a store or he's hit a police officer.
00:08:15.953,00:08:18.247,-Every time the phone rings. -I know. I know.
00:08:18.331,00:08:21.083,But maybe now it's time for us to take a step back.
00:08:21.709,00:08:26.547,"Spend time together, just the two of us, you know, get back to where we were before all of this."
00:08:27.173,00:08:28.049,Maybe we go on a date.
00:08:29.008,00:08:29.842,Hmm?
00:08:29.926,00:08:31.719,Or we... we fool around.
00:08:33.429,00:08:34.764,"-Huh? -Yeah, right."
00:08:34.847,00:08:35.890,No?
00:08:38.476,00:08:39.602,Oh.
00:08:40.478,00:08:41.479,You're serious.
00:08:42.355,00:08:43.689,I'm not serious.
00:08:43.773,00:08:45.441,-I'm sorry. -I'm just playing.
00:08:57.828,00:09:03.209,"repetitive behaviors, difficulty socializing and persistent, intense preoccupations."
00:09:03.292,00:09:06.963,I have a patient who came up with 95 ways to cook an egg.
00:09:10.424,00:09:11.676,Come on in.
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.346,"Please, sit."
00:09:16.889,00:09:17.974,"-Yeah, thanks. -Oh."
00:09:19.809,00:09:21.894,Is everything okay with Sam?
00:09:21.978,00:09:24.397,"Oh, yes. It's fine."
00:09:24.480,00:09:25.773,"I just, um..."
00:09:29.193,00:09:31.529,Sam said you spoke to him about dating.
00:09:32.530,00:09:34.824,"He mentioned wanting a girlfriend, so I thought..."
00:09:34.907,00:09:40.621,"I appreciate you're trying to help, but all the things that make my son's everyday life difficult..."
00:09:40.705,00:09:44.208,"like reading social cues, exchanging small talk..."
00:09:44.292,00:09:48.421,"all the things I've helped him navigate his entire life, are magnified in dating."
00:09:49.422,00:09:50.256,Um...
00:09:50.965,00:09:57.179,"Dating is almost entirely nonverbal communication, and Sam's the most literal person I know."
00:09:57.847,00:10:00.516,"Yeah, and there are strategies that I could teach him."
00:10:00.600,00:10:01.601,Are there?
00:10:03.102,00:10:05.771,Are there strategies for when you get your heart broken?
00:10:07.773,00:10:09.567,Sam is doing really well.
00:10:10.151,00:10:14.488,"I mean, we're 32 days into his senior year, and he hasn't had a meltdown yet, so..."
00:10:15.489,00:10:16.741,I don't want to push him.
00:10:16.824,00:10:20.119,"I mean, relationships are hard enough for neurotypicals."
00:10:20.202,00:10:22.622,I don't want to put that kind of pressure on my son.
00:10:23.289,00:10:26.667,There was a study done in Toronto a few years ago.
00:10:27.376,00:10:36.677,"Researchers found that only nine percent of adults with autism are married, not because they lack the desire, but because they don't know how to do it."
00:10:36.761,00:10:40.014,Your son has the same desire to be loved that we all do.
00:10:40.640,00:10:41.891,Why shouldn't he pursue it?
00:10:43.392,00:10:45.019,He's not ready yet.
00:10:45.686,00:10:49.899,"You know, a lot of parents have a hard time as their kids become more independent."
00:10:49.982,00:10:52.693,It's completely natural.
00:10:52.777,00:10:57.156,"So if you ever need someone to talk to, I can refer you to one of my colleagues."
00:10:57.239,00:10:58.783,"Oh, wow. No, um..."
00:11:01.452,00:11:02.870,That won't be necessary.
00:11:04.580,00:11:05.706,Thank you for your time.
00:11:08.250,00:11:10.461,That's okay. I got it. Thanks so much.
00:11:10.544,00:11:11.796,-Have a great day. -Okay.
00:11:20.179,00:11:25.559,"like how to get infinity lives in a video game or date girls, I do a lot of research."
00:11:25.643,00:11:26.560,I like research.
00:11:26.644,00:11:28.020,Insult them.
00:11:28.104,00:11:31.565,"Something like, Baby, those some serious bug eyes you got."
00:11:32.566,00:11:34.360,"-Trust me, brother... -Bug eyes?"
00:11:34.443,00:11:36.404,...quickest way to get a chick on your dick.
00:11:40.324,00:11:42.243,"Yo, yo, mamacita."
00:11:42.952,00:11:44.537,Is that a phone in your back pocket?
00:11:45.329,00:11:46.872,'Cause that ass is calling to me.
00:11:48.833,00:11:50.376,And I ask questions.
00:11:50.459,00:11:52.420,Just listen to what they say.
00:11:52.503,00:11:54.839,Don't bring up seals or penguins or whatever.
00:11:54.922,00:11:56.674,And don't stare at their boobs.
00:11:56.757,00:11:57.883,"Wait, slow down."
00:11:57.967,00:12:01.178,I'm still on the no penguins part. What if she likes penguins?
00:12:01.846,00:12:03.055,Just assume she doesn't.
00:12:04.890,00:12:07.518,The trick is knowing when to put my research to use.
00:12:07.601,00:12:09.186,I'm not great at picking up signals.
00:12:11.063,00:12:13.482,"Yo, Sammy. Red over there is making eyes."
00:12:14.066,00:12:15.818,-What? -That chick.
00:12:15.901,00:12:17.737,Bubble Butt by the monitors.
00:12:19.530,00:12:20.698,What about her?
00:12:20.781,00:12:22.575,"Dude, she's smiling right at you."
00:12:24.285,00:12:25.119,Oh.
00:12:25.745,00:12:26.579,So?
00:12:27.163,00:12:29.248,-Smile back. -Really?
00:12:38.382,00:12:39.717,Wow.
00:12:39.800,00:12:41.677,You scared her away from across the store.
00:12:42.470,00:12:43.804,"Impressive range, dude."
00:13:02.114,00:13:03.073,"Oh, no."
00:13:03.157,00:13:06.285,I'm sure whoever did this just feels terrible.
00:13:08.996,00:13:09.830,Bailey.
00:13:19.798,00:13:22.218,I don't get it. You're not even friends with Beth.
00:13:22.301,00:13:24.303,So? You don't have to be friends to do what's right.
00:13:24.595,00:13:27.765,"Sweetie, hitting someone's face is never right."
00:13:27.848,00:13:30.935,Of course you don't get it. You were the one picking on the fat kids.
00:13:31.018,00:13:32.353,I had a pudgy friend.
00:13:32.436,00:13:36.398,"Besides, Bailey Bennet is a lovely girl, and she did not deserve to get punched."
00:13:36.482,00:13:37.733,Bailey Bennet is a twat.
00:13:37.816,00:13:39.235,"Casey Gardener, language."
00:13:39.318,00:13:46.575,"Sometimes a word or phrase gets stuck in my head, like on on a loop, and it just plays over and over and over and over."
00:13:46.659,00:13:48.619,Twat. Twat.
00:13:48.911,00:13:51.622,"Twat, twat, twat, twat, twat, twat, twat..."
00:13:54.625,00:13:57.253,-You're gonna miss practice. -They said I could practice.
00:13:58.712,00:14:02.466,-At least she's not gonna miss practice. -She punched a pretty girl in the face!
00:14:04.343,00:14:06.428,Twat. Twat.
00:14:06.512,00:14:07.805,Twat.
00:14:07.888,00:14:10.975,"Twat, twat, twat, twat, twat, twat, twat."
00:14:11.058,00:14:12.393,You're grounded.
00:14:12.476,00:14:14.812,All right. That seems fair. I'm gonna go for a run.
00:14:14.895,00:14:16.605,"Can I run when I'm grounded, warden?"
00:14:17.273,00:14:18.899,I'm done. You deal with her.
00:14:19.859,00:14:20.776,Go ahead.
00:14:22.027,00:14:24.446,-Awesome. -Great. Now I'm the bad guy again.
00:14:24.530,00:14:27.408,Casey and I are cool. You're always gonna be the bad guy with her.
00:14:56.103,00:14:58.689,"Hey, Casey! I brought you a chocolate cake."
00:14:58.772,00:15:00.441,I make amazing cakes.
00:15:00.524,00:15:02.318,I won three bake-offs at my church.
00:15:03.193,00:15:05.696,This is my brother Evan. He drove me here.
00:15:05.779,00:15:07.406,-Hey. -Hey.
00:15:07.489,00:15:10.242,Okay. Thanks for the cake.
00:15:10.326,00:15:12.161,Thank you for today.
00:15:13.329,00:15:14.163,-Twat! -Sam!
00:15:14.246,00:15:15.831,"-Jesus! -Um, hello."
00:15:15.915,00:15:17.207,What is wrong with him?
00:15:17.291,00:15:19.376,Nothing's wrong with him. Get away from him.
00:15:21.253,00:15:23.547,It's cool. I got it.
00:15:24.465,00:15:25.549,"All right, bye."
00:15:27.509,00:15:29.720,You forgot your chocolate cake!
00:15:29.803,00:15:31.388,I'll just leave it on the porch.
00:15:32.348,00:15:33.641,You're such an asshole.
00:15:35.184,00:15:37.061,My sister doesn't let anyone beat me up...
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.609,"Got to do it four times, right?"
00:15:43.692,00:15:44.693,Ow!
00:15:44.818,00:15:46.487,...except herself.
00:15:49.573,00:15:51.116,"So, how's your week?"
00:15:51.200,00:15:52.701,"Well, I still don't have a date."
00:15:52.785,00:15:56.830,"I scared a girl off from across the room, and we had meat loaf twice, and I hate meat loaf."
00:15:56.914,00:15:57.790,How?
00:15:57.873,00:15:59.541,My mom just made it in the oven.
00:16:02.169,00:16:05.422,I don't know. I've been wondering and wondering and wondering.
00:16:05.506,00:16:08.050,Okay. Pretend I'm her. What'd you do?
00:16:08.926,00:16:11.387,I just smiled at her like this.
00:16:12.638,00:16:13.555,Ah.
00:16:14.223,00:16:15.599,I read about it online.
00:16:17.518,00:16:20.688,Making eye contact and smiling are step one for flirting.
00:16:20.771,00:16:21.939,That's what I did. Look.
00:16:24.817,00:16:26.735,Insults equal chick on dick.
00:16:26.819,00:16:28.696,Not that part. The eye contact part.
00:16:28.779,00:16:31.782,"Right, but we should get to that at some point."
00:16:32.950,00:16:38.497,"Anyways, the problem is you're crossing the line from flirty to creepy."
00:16:38.580,00:16:41.125,"When you make eye contact, you have to look away a bit."
00:16:41.208,00:16:45.004,But how can I make eye contact and look away?
00:16:45.087,00:16:47.297,"I mean, I'm not a mantis shrimp."
00:16:48.674,00:16:51.969,"Okay, you make eye contact..."
00:16:52.803,00:16:53.929,glance away...
00:16:54.596,00:16:56.223,make eye contact again.
00:16:57.391,00:16:58.809,"Otherwise, it can seem scary."
00:16:58.892,00:17:01.687,-Hold on. Let me write this down. -Okay.
00:17:03.105,00:17:04.773,"Now, the smile."
00:17:06.400,00:17:09.194,"You need to turn that down, like, 70%."
00:17:09.278,00:17:11.947,-70% smaller? -At least.
00:17:15.075,00:17:16.326,Try no teeth?
00:17:18.495,00:17:20.998,Yeah! That's the one. That's perfect.
00:17:24.460,00:17:26.795,"They didn't taste purple, but they were purple carrots."
00:17:29.631,00:17:31.759,"It tasted weird, but it was good."
00:17:31.842,00:17:39.266,"Okay, don't look, but there's a couple on my right that's on possibly the worst first date ever."
00:17:41.810,00:17:44.646,She just asked him if he wanted children.
00:17:44.730,00:17:48.442,-They haven't even ordered appetizers. -God. There's no coming back from that.
00:17:48.525,00:17:50.778,-We should tell them what they're in for. -No.
00:17:53.072,00:17:57.159,"You know, there is a small chance that you're right."
00:17:57.242,00:17:58.202,Yeah?
00:17:58.285,00:18:00.579,-A night out was a good idea. -Just a small chance?
00:18:00.662,00:18:01.747,Yeah.
00:18:02.498,00:18:03.749,I'm even wearing...
00:18:06.668,00:18:07.503,"Me, too."
00:18:09.046,00:18:13.467,-How's yours? Mine's really uncomfortable. -I feel good. Holds everything in place.
00:18:16.053,00:18:16.929,"See, this is nice."
00:18:17.012,00:18:18.097,Mm.
00:18:18.597,00:18:20.182,-We needed this. -Mm-hmm.
00:18:22.559,00:18:23.602,We did.
00:18:25.479,00:18:28.273,It's just hard for me to relax sometimes.
00:18:29.274,00:18:32.736,-I get so worried about the kids and... -I know. But everything's good.
00:18:32.820,00:18:34.655,The kids are great. Everything's fine.
00:18:35.989,00:18:38.700,"-The kids are great? -Oh, come on. Here we go."
00:18:39.660,00:18:42.830,"No, I just want to hear why you think the kids are so great."
00:18:42.913,00:18:44.790,-Why are you getting upset? -I'm not.
00:18:44.873,00:18:46.834,You're implying that I worry over nothing.
00:18:46.917,00:18:49.378,"Well... I mean, sometimes, you do."
00:18:50.671,00:18:53.841,"I mean, who cares? Sam wants to date. That's good. That's a good thing."
00:18:53.966,00:18:55.884,He's 18. It'd be weird if he didn't want to date.
00:18:55.968,00:18:59.012,"Because, Doug, it's not just dating."
00:18:59.096,00:19:03.433,"First it's dating, and then he's graduating, and then he's moving out into the world."
00:19:03.517,00:19:05.561,"We can't protect him, and that's terrifying."
00:19:05.644,00:19:07.020,That's what we want for him.
00:19:07.104,00:19:10.524,There's a lot we want -that aren't possible for him. -How do you know?
00:19:10.607,00:19:13.152,I'm the one that's been with him for these last 18 years.
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.946,You've never been close to him. You don't even try.
00:19:16.029,00:19:19.283,"I mean, honestly, there is times I think you don't even like him."
00:19:21.785,00:19:22.911,That's what you think?
00:19:24.496,00:19:25.956,I love our son.
00:19:27.207,00:19:31.461,"I always have. Has it been hard to connect with him? Yeah, it has been."
00:19:32.004,00:19:34.548,I thought he'd be more like me or like you.
00:19:34.631,00:19:37.885,He's not like either one of us or anyone else I've ever met.
00:19:38.802,00:19:39.678,-I know. -Yeah.
00:19:39.761,00:19:42.097,You remember his ninth birthday?
00:19:42.181,00:19:43.140,He wanted an igloo.
00:19:43.223,00:19:45.267,-And what did I do? -You built it.
00:19:45.350,00:19:52.482,"Yeah, I spent 19 hours hauling and stacking fricking ice blocks into the backyard just so my son would notice I was there."
00:19:53.192,00:19:54.109,So he would like me.
00:19:54.193,00:19:56.195,And he wouldn't even go inside because...
00:19:56.278,00:19:58.488,the ice blocks weren't lined up precisely.
00:19:58.572,00:20:02.492,"-Okay. -You're not the only one in the family who has an autistic kid, Elsa."
00:20:04.494,00:20:05.996,Can I get you anything else?
00:20:06.079,00:20:08.540,"-No. Thank you. -No, thank you."
00:20:13.086,00:20:14.296,Not it.
00:20:20.177,00:20:21.220,Hey!
00:20:25.057,00:20:25.891,Hi.
00:20:27.184,00:20:30.270,I just came to get Beth's cake pan back.
00:20:30.354,00:20:31.772,Okay.
00:20:32.356,00:20:33.941,I could've brought it to school.
00:20:34.608,00:20:35.442,Weird.
00:20:35.525,00:20:37.152,"Should I come in or, um..."
00:20:37.236,00:20:38.654,I'll just hang here.
00:20:40.822,00:20:41.990,Here you go.
00:20:42.532,00:20:45.410,It's been washed twice... once by me and once by my mom.
00:20:45.494,00:20:47.371,-'Cause that's my mom. -Thanks.
00:20:48.163,00:20:51.166,That was nice of you to punch that girl in the face for my sister.
00:20:51.250,00:20:53.126,"Oh, yeah, you're welcome."
00:20:53.835,00:20:56.421,"Hey, do you want to go out sometime?"
00:20:58.840,00:21:00.133,Go out?
00:21:00.884,00:21:03.720,-With you? -Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
00:21:03.804,00:21:06.139,I'm sorry. I don't really date.
00:21:06.223,00:21:08.141,It's just not a distraction I need.
00:21:08.225,00:21:10.894,I'm gonna get a track scholarship and get out of this town.
00:21:10.978,00:21:12.771,"Oh. Well, fair enough."
00:21:13.480,00:21:16.984,"I'm probably gonna change your mind about that dating thing, though."
00:21:17.067,00:21:18.735,"You know, I kind of grow on people."
00:21:18.819,00:21:21.238,Stop the presses! A girl wants to go out with me.
00:21:21.863,00:21:23.198,Oh. Hello.
00:21:24.950,00:21:26.159,I got to go.
00:21:32.749,00:21:35.502,"Her name's Bree, B-r-e-e."
00:21:35.585,00:21:40.299,"And she likes something called vegan taquitos, and she has a cat named Simba. I don't love cats."
00:21:40.382,00:21:43.218,-Do you think she'd get rid of it? -Do not ask her that.
00:21:44.344,00:21:46.388,-Where are you gonna go? -I thought about it.
00:21:46.471,00:21:49.933,-I'll take her to Techtropolis. -Take a date to an appliance store?
00:21:50.017,00:21:52.394,"-I have to go where I'm comfortable. -Oh, my God."
00:21:52.477,00:21:56.189,It'll be fun. We can sample different TVs and see which one has the best clarity.
00:21:56.273,00:21:58.150,"I know, but we'll see if she gets it right."
00:22:01.028,00:22:02.863,-Coffee? -Mm-hmm.
00:22:03.697,00:22:05.615,Who goes out for coffee?
00:22:05.699,00:22:08.994,Hey. Relax. This is gonna be okay.
00:22:09.828,00:22:11.330,"No, it's not."
00:22:12.748,00:22:14.207,"Yeah, no, it's not."
00:22:18.795,00:22:21.798,I can't think. I can't listen. I just freeze.
00:22:22.382,00:22:24.301,But... don't worry.
00:22:24.384,00:22:25.343,I have a strategy.
00:22:26.595,00:22:27.971,Floor here's kind of sticky.
00:22:30.057,00:22:36.188,Did you know that some frogs have pads on their feet that secrete a thin layer of mucus so to help them climb things?
00:22:37.439,00:22:38.982,What's with the headphones?
00:22:39.775,00:22:42.986,Oh. I just turned on the noise-cancellation feature.
00:22:43.070,00:22:45.405,Need a little protection from the racket.
00:22:52.329,00:22:55.082,"Baby, those are some serious bug eyes you got."
00:22:55.665,00:22:56.500,What?
00:23:00.462,00:23:02.047,Mamacita...
00:23:02.589,00:23:03.590,your ass is on the phone?
00:23:06.635,00:23:09.221,I don't like cats. Would you be willing to get rid of Simba?
00:23:13.975,00:23:15.602,"Yo, I'm clocking out."
00:23:15.685,00:23:18.063,-Can you see my nipples through here? -Yes.
00:23:18.146,00:23:20.774,Good. I was standing in front of the air conditioner.
00:23:20.857,00:23:22.526,"So, how's it going with the ladies?"
00:23:23.401,00:23:25.862,I'm not dating anymore. It's too difficult.
00:23:25.946,00:23:29.950,"You have to guess what people are thinking, and not just people, girls."
00:23:30.033,00:23:32.160,-They think I'm weird. -You are weird. So what?
00:23:32.244,00:23:35.455,"The French eat snails. That's weird, but you know they're getting laid."
00:23:35.539,00:23:37.040,"Hey, look. Red's back."
00:23:38.166,00:23:39.417,Ask her out.
00:23:39.501,00:23:40.877,"Go, go, go!"
00:23:40.961,00:23:41.962,Go!
00:23:42.421,00:23:43.547,Go.
00:23:54.933,00:23:56.643,Laser or inkjet?
00:23:56.726,00:23:58.228,"Oh, uh..."
00:23:58.311,00:24:01.189,I don't know. I didn't really do any research.
00:24:01.273,00:24:05.944,"Well, lucky for you, I love research, and I know all about these printers."
00:24:06.027,00:24:07.237,You should get this one.
00:24:07.320,00:24:09.781,The other ones are garbage and should be set on fire.
00:24:09.865,00:24:11.867,Wow. Thanks.
00:24:11.950,00:24:13.702,That's actually really helpful.
00:24:32.429,00:24:34.472,Would you like to go on a date with me?
00:24:34.556,00:24:37.726,"That's the reason I came over here, not to help you with printers."
00:24:42.564,00:24:43.398,Okay.
00:24:55.327,00:24:56.369,He got a date!
00:24:59.789,00:25:01.541,-You going to hockey? -Yeah.
00:25:01.625,00:25:03.126,I shouldn't be home late.
00:25:04.252,00:25:05.462,Honey.
00:25:06.254,00:25:08.965,I'm sorry about dinner the other night.
00:25:09.049,00:25:12.093,"I'm just stressed, and... it was a really nice idea."
00:25:12.177,00:25:14.471,"It's all right. Oh, listen, I..."
00:25:14.554,00:25:15.889,I got you something.
00:25:16.556,00:25:17.807,"You love to dance, right?"
00:25:18.725,00:25:22.103,"You should check this out, have some fun, maybe make a friend."
00:25:22.187,00:25:23.396,You look good.
00:25:23.480,00:25:24.689,Sheesh!
00:25:24.773,00:25:27.317,I don't even know if I'll be able to dance anymore.
00:25:41.623,00:25:44.834,Thank you so much. That was so much fun!
00:25:44.918,00:25:47.671,"Oh, you're welcome! You're great. You're a dancer, huh?"
00:25:47.754,00:25:49.881,"What? Oh, no. I mean, forever ago."
00:25:49.965,00:25:53.093,I was the captain of the dance squad in college.
00:25:53.176,00:25:54.469,-Oh. -Yeah.
00:25:54.552,00:25:56.805,"We ranked nationally three times, almost four."
00:25:56.888,00:25:59.015,"We were robbed, but whatever. I'm over it."
00:25:59.766,00:26:02.811,"Hey, a few of us are gonna go grab a drink. You want to come?"
00:26:02.894,00:26:05.480,"Um, uh..."
00:26:06.648,00:26:07.857,Sure.
00:26:09.693,00:26:11.278,This is so much fun.
00:26:12.904,00:26:15.198,I feel like I'm back in college again.
00:26:19.160,00:26:20.203,Want another drink?
00:26:20.912,00:26:23.290,"Um... no, thanks."
00:26:23.373,00:26:26.543,I think I've escaped my real life long enough.
00:26:27.877,00:26:32.215,I don't know why I said that. I love my life. I love it. Love it.
00:26:32.299,00:26:33.633,This one's on me.
00:26:40.307,00:26:45.645,"When you told me we were having dinner in the Techtropolis parking lot, I thought you were kidding."
00:26:46.479,00:26:47.522,"No, I don't do that."
00:26:48.356,00:26:49.649,Oh.
00:26:49.733,00:26:51.151,-You're very pretty. -Thanks.
00:26:51.234,00:26:53.737,I always thought my nose was too big.
00:26:53.820,00:26:56.990,"A little, but the rest of your face makes up for it."
00:26:59.743,00:27:00.827,Wow.
00:27:00.910,00:27:02.203,"You're really honest, huh?"
00:27:02.287,00:27:03.955,Yes. Is that bad?
00:27:05.123,00:27:06.958,No. It's refreshing.
00:27:07.042,00:27:08.960,-Tell me more. -Okay.
00:27:09.044,00:27:14.174,"I'm really good at fixing computers, and biology is my favorite subject in school."
00:27:14.257,00:27:15.383,Girls don't like me.
00:27:15.467,00:27:18.803,"I love penguins, but I'm not supposed to talk about it."
00:27:18.887,00:27:25.602,"I've never had sex before, and I have a pet turtle named Edison, who's named after Thomas Edison, but he's not as smart."
00:27:28.438,00:27:29.647,You're hilarious.
00:27:29.731,00:27:30.774,Thank you.
00:27:33.735,00:27:34.903,You never had sex?
00:27:35.487,00:27:36.404,No.
00:27:38.823,00:27:39.657,Want to?
00:27:50.710,00:27:51.628,What are you doing?
00:27:51.711,00:27:55.298,I just came to see if you changed your mind about going out with me.
00:27:56.758,00:27:57.801,I brought you this.
00:27:57.884,00:28:00.095,What is up with your family bringing me sweets?
00:28:00.970,00:28:02.430,I don't know. I like you.
00:28:03.306,00:28:04.140,Why?
00:28:04.224,00:28:05.517,Uh...
00:28:07.143,00:28:11.147,"'Cause most people don't stand up to assholes, but you do."
00:28:25.495,00:28:26.955,-Then there was Mel. -Mm-hmm.
00:28:27.038,00:28:29.290,"That was my longest relationship, like a month."
00:28:29.374,00:28:30.417,Wow. A month.
00:28:32.711,00:28:35.130,Why am I telling you this? Let's talk about something else.
00:28:35.213,00:28:37.424,What? No. I want to hear about your month with Mel.
00:28:40.885,00:28:43.680,"I don't know. I like what I do, I guess."
00:28:43.763,00:28:46.057,-Mm-hmm. -I don't mean my job necessarily.
00:28:46.141,00:28:47.559,Just my life.
00:28:48.351,00:28:51.062,I wake up when I want. I do what I want. I go where I want.
00:28:51.146,00:28:53.606,"Last week, I wanted to go to the mountains, so I did."
00:28:53.690,00:28:56.109,I didn't have to plan anything or run it by anyone.
00:28:56.192,00:28:58.862,"I mean, that may be weird, but I just..."
00:28:58.945,00:29:00.029,I need that.
00:29:04.284,00:29:06.202,Is that totally lame or what?
00:29:08.496,00:29:10.165,"No, that sounds great."
00:29:10.248,00:29:12.834,"I mean, you're a little old for that, but, you know?"
00:29:16.045,00:29:23.178,"I think, if it were really, really cold, like Antarctica cold, the coldness would feel like a sound."
00:29:23.261,00:29:26.014,The cold would be so intense that you could hear it.
00:29:26.097,00:29:27.515,I would like to hear that sound.
00:29:41.029,00:29:44.365,Never been in a dorm. This isn't what I thought it would smell like.
00:29:45.200,00:29:47.827,Yeah. My roommate makes a lot of ramen.
00:29:51.414,00:29:54.209,"It has to be hard touch, uh, pressure."
00:29:54.292,00:29:56.377,I like pressure. I don't like soft.
00:29:56.461,00:29:58.880,Is that okay to say on the first date?
00:30:17.106,00:30:17.941,Aah!
00:30:18.024,00:30:19.484,What the hell?
00:30:21.319,00:30:23.321,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:30:23.404,00:30:24.864,What is wrong with you?
00:30:24.948,00:30:28.618,"Seriously, are you retarded? Is there something wrong with your brain?"
00:30:31.913,00:30:33.957,Get the hell out of my room.
00:30:38.503,00:30:42.507,"Sometimes, when I feel most alone, I imagine myself in that ice..."
00:30:42.590,00:30:45.760,"frozen, unable to move, but safe."
00:30:55.270,00:30:59.190,"I thought technical school would be dumb, but I actually really like it."
00:31:00.483,00:31:03.820,"Oh, hey. There he is, the twat guy."
00:31:04.696,00:31:05.864,What's wrong?
00:31:20.378,00:31:22.422,"Here. Careful, it's hot."
00:31:26.843,00:31:28.678,The first time's always a shit show.
00:31:29.512,00:31:33.975,"My first time was on a Ping-Pong table, and it collapsed like two seconds in."
00:31:34.058,00:31:36.853,My balls got all wrapped up in the net. Really freaked her out.
00:31:38.021,00:31:40.315,"How about you, Case? Was it crappy your first time?"
00:31:40.398,00:31:41.774,"Okay, gross."
00:31:41.858,00:31:44.485,I'm not discussing my sex life in front of my brother.
00:31:44.569,00:31:46.654,Not that there's anything to discuss.
00:31:49.532,00:31:51.242,"Sometimes, I wish I was normal."
00:31:51.326,00:31:52.660,"Well, dude..."
00:31:53.286,00:31:54.370,nobody's normal.
00:32:20.355,00:32:27.403,"In fourth grade, my biology teacher, Mr. Durocher-- he was fat-- said penguins are similar to humans..."
00:32:28.696,00:32:32.408,"because once they copulate, they stay with the same partner for life."
00:32:33.159,00:32:35.453,"So, what about you? What's your life like?"
00:32:38.081,00:32:43.211,"Well, ironically, when I was in college, I also dated a girl for about a month."
00:32:46.589,00:32:49.258,And I am a hairdresser.
00:32:49.342,00:32:50.593,Yours is too short.
00:32:52.470,00:32:55.014,You're funny. And kind of mean.
00:32:57.892,00:33:00.144,"Yeah, I'm always mean to people I like."
00:33:00.770,00:33:02.939,I think it's 'cause I expect so much.
00:33:03.815,00:33:05.108,So you like me.
00:33:10.154,00:33:15.034,"which is the most recent data I could acquire, 49% of marriages end in divorce."
00:33:17.662,00:33:19.414,Sorry. Um...
00:33:21.666,00:33:23.501,"You know, um..."
00:33:23.584,00:33:29.882,"if you turn the heat up on your dishwasher, you won't have those ugly white spots on the glasses. Just so..."
00:33:45.648,00:33:48.317,So penguins aren't like people.
00:33:53.031,00:33:54.490,They're better.
00:34:15.553,00:34:17.680,I wonder if they ever get tired of swimming.
00:34:18.181,00:34:19.307,They don't.
00:34:23.644,00:34:26.981,"You know, Casey... told me what happened..."
00:34:28.357,00:34:29.650,with the girl.
00:34:31.861,00:34:33.279,I wish I had a time machine.
00:34:33.362,00:34:39.243,I would go back in time and never ask her out and also maybe visit the Middle Ages because...
00:34:39.327,00:34:40.578,jousting.
00:34:41.621,00:34:48.377,"Look, I don't know about some of that stuff you're into, but girls I know about, okay? And they're tough."
00:34:49.670,00:34:52.799,I'm proud of you for putting yourself out there.
00:34:53.800,00:34:58.096,I should never go on another date. I should just stay away from girls.
00:34:58.971,00:35:01.849,"Sam, look, you got some stuff to figure out, but you will."
00:35:03.643,00:35:04.894,You're a good guy.
00:35:04.977,00:35:10.274,"You're sensitive, and you're funny, and the woman who ends up with you will be lucky."
00:35:11.651,00:35:13.319,You want to marry your best friend.
00:35:14.654,00:35:15.530,Edison?
00:35:15.613,00:35:16.572,No.
00:35:17.198,00:35:18.491,"Not your turtle, Sam."
00:35:18.574,00:35:20.993,You said my best friend. He's my best friend.
00:35:22.078,00:35:23.121,I just...
00:35:24.038,00:35:28.292,I meant you want to be with someone who appreciates you for what you are.
00:35:29.127,00:35:32.797,"You know, who loves all the little odd things about you..."
00:35:33.506,00:35:34.590,who gets you.
00:35:37.969,00:35:39.762,"Penguins mate for life, you know?"
00:35:41.389,00:35:42.515,Yeah?
00:35:43.850,00:35:45.184,"Well, good for them."
00:35:46.853,00:35:50.565,"So, how are you feeling now? Still ready to give up on dating?"
00:35:50.648,00:35:56.571,"I don't know. My dad said to find someone who appreciates me for what I am, which is a weirdo."
00:35:57.530,00:35:58.614,We talked a lot.
00:35:58.698,00:36:00.158,Glad to hear it.
00:36:00.241,00:36:03.411,And that makes sense. You're easy to talk to.
00:36:07.206,00:36:08.291,Yeah.
00:36:09.041,00:36:13.671,"You're easy to talk to, too, which is good 'cause, otherwise, you'd go broke."
00:36:21.262,00:36:22.346,he makes an offering.
00:36:23.139,00:36:29.020,"He finds a pebble, often taking the time to find the smoothest one, and presents it to the female."
00:36:29.854,00:36:32.690,"I'm a human, so it would be weird to offer a pebble."
00:36:33.357,00:36:34.233,Julia.
00:36:39.280,00:36:40.448,After I die.
00:36:41.115,00:36:42.950,"Oh, Sam, that's so great."
00:36:45.369,00:36:46.871,You're gonna help so many people.
00:36:48.664,00:36:50.291,Good smile.
00:36:50.374,00:36:51.751,It's not creepy at all.
00:36:51.834,00:36:53.252,I've been practicing.
00:36:53.336,00:36:54.503,"Yeah, I can tell."
00:36:59.508,00:37:01.219,she accepts him as a mate.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.846,"And as you already know, penguins mate for life."
00:00:13.722,00:00:16.016,I've decided to look nice whenever I see her.
00:00:16.099,00:00:20.437,"That kind of thing is important to girls, but looking nice is hard."
00:00:22.439,00:00:23.982,Yeah. Look at you.
00:00:24.065,00:00:25.442,Cock of the walk.
00:00:26.776,00:00:28.445,"You know, because of your hair."
00:00:29.446,00:00:30.613,That makes no sense.
00:00:31.281,00:00:34.367,I look nothing like a rooster. Roosters don't even have hair.
00:00:34.451,00:00:36.453,"They have a coxcomb, which is fleshy."
00:00:36.536,00:00:38.788,"Whoa, whoa, that's like what, the..."
00:00:38.872,00:00:40.874,"what, the red thing on a chicken's head?"
00:00:40.957,00:00:42.250,Yes.
00:00:43.209,00:00:44.461,Coxcomb.
00:00:45.628,00:00:47.172,That's a funny word.
00:00:57.182,00:00:59.434,but they have some interesting habits.
00:01:01.352,00:01:07.609,"In a natural setting, a rooster will entice hens into mating by spreading his feathers and performing a demonstrative dance."
00:01:08.985,00:01:10.028,Jeez!
00:01:10.904,00:01:13.823,-Don't sneak up. You made me overzest. -Why so jumpy?
00:01:13.907,00:01:15.533,I know. I couldn't help myself.
00:01:15.617,00:01:18.578,-These lemon squares look delicious. -They're not for you.
00:01:18.661,00:01:20.580,"-They're for group. -All right, okay."
00:01:20.663,00:01:22.499,"Okay, they look fantastic."
00:01:38.598,00:01:41.226,and dance around the female in a circular pattern.
00:01:44.312,00:01:46.022,"Shit, Casey."
00:01:46.105,00:01:48.149,That's a grown-ass man right there.
00:01:48.233,00:01:50.652,"Are you banging, or are you still in handy land?"
00:01:55.365,00:01:59.119,You didn't mention a boyfriend. How could you not tell me you have a boyfriend?
00:01:59.202,00:02:00.745,We're just hanging out.
00:02:00.829,00:02:02.831,-Mm-hmm. -Hanging out with his dick.
00:02:07.544,00:02:08.545,Are you?
00:02:14.259,00:02:15.510,Go away.
00:02:18.763,00:02:22.267,or just being your girlfriend takes different skills.
00:02:22.350,00:02:23.726,It requires research.
00:02:23.810,00:02:26.521,You can't just ask a girl out.
00:02:26.604,00:02:28.940,You have to learn the important things about her first.
00:02:29.023,00:02:30.567,What's your favorite type of lemonade?
00:02:31.860,00:02:33.820,"Uh, regular?"
00:02:35.446,00:02:36.698,Do you like movies?
00:02:37.448,00:02:39.784,Yes. I love them.
00:02:39.868,00:02:41.870,Do you have any fears or phobias?
00:02:43.246,00:02:45.623,-Nope. -What are your favorite winter sports?
00:02:47.584,00:02:50.086,"Well, we have been snowshoeing a couple times."
00:02:52.046,00:02:54.591,We? As in you and your mom.
00:02:55.216,00:02:56.259,Me and my boyfriend.
00:02:56.885,00:02:58.177,Snowshoeing was his idea.
00:03:01.306,00:03:02.390,You have a boyfriend?
00:03:02.473,00:03:04.183,Mm-hmm. Miles.
00:03:05.560,00:03:08.897,"Anyway, it's great that you're showing so much interest in others."
00:03:08.980,00:03:10.523,We've been working on that.
00:03:12.817,00:03:15.612,"Now, when Mr. Tavern's voice bothers you..."
00:03:31.628,00:03:35.215,I would hit or bang my head or yell.
00:03:35.298,00:03:38.176,Now I try to use replacement behaviors instead.
00:03:44.474,00:03:45.391,Sam.
00:03:46.100,00:03:47.143,Is everything okay?
00:03:49.187,00:03:50.396,Want to talk?
00:03:51.856,00:03:53.233,Maybe I should talk to Mom.
00:03:53.316,00:03:56.486,"That's usually how things go around here, but Mom has her group tonight."
00:03:56.569,00:03:58.238,Okay? Maybe I can help.
00:04:01.741,00:04:02.659,I like a girl.
00:04:04.035,00:04:05.119,Really?
00:04:07.372,00:04:09.916,That's good. What's she like?
00:04:09.999,00:04:12.418,"She's smart, and she's pretty."
00:04:12.502,00:04:15.046,And she has a boyfriend-- Miles.
00:04:15.129,00:04:16.256,Stupid Miles!
00:04:18.716,00:04:21.135,"But, you know, it's not the end of the world."
00:04:21.678,00:04:23.680,Mom had a boyfriend when I first met her.
00:04:27.016,00:04:30.311,-She did? -This guy Gerald Redenbach.
00:04:30.395,00:04:34.941,He had a Jeep and a golden retriever that wore a bandanna.
00:04:35.608,00:04:37.026,She thought he was so cool.
00:04:37.694,00:04:40.405,And y-you stole Mom away from him?
00:04:42.115,00:04:43.116,Something like that.
00:04:45.827,00:04:46.703,How?
00:04:46.786,00:04:51.332,"I just... stuck around, being my sweet, charming self."
00:04:51.416,00:04:52.417,And that worked?
00:04:52.500,00:04:54.252,"Well, proof is in the pudding, right?"
00:04:54.335,00:04:55.670,I don't like pudding.
00:04:55.753,00:04:57.422,"Well, forget the pudding."
00:04:57.505,00:04:59.799,"The point is, is you're young, Sam, you know."
00:04:59.882,00:05:02.093,"Relationships, they come and they go."
00:05:02.176,00:05:06.055,"She might have a boyfriend this week and next week, who knows?"
00:05:06.139,00:05:07.348,Does that make sense?
00:05:09.142,00:05:10.310,Yes.
00:05:10.393,00:05:14.355,I should make myself available in case Miles goes away or dies.
00:05:15.023,00:05:17.692,Or they break up amicably.
00:05:20.862,00:05:22.822,Okay. I'll do that.
00:05:22.905,00:05:24.032,You should.
00:05:29.078,00:05:30.705,I think this went well.
00:05:30.788,00:05:31.956,"Me, too."
00:05:36.544,00:05:38.504,"I know we're always, um..."
00:05:38.588,00:05:44.343,"talking in here about, you know, taking time for ourselves and I did."
00:05:45.845,00:05:48.014,I took a dance class. Silly.
00:05:48.514,00:05:49.682,Um...
00:05:49.766,00:05:52.185,The teacher thought I was really good.
00:05:52.977,00:05:54.937,Really silly. But she did say that.
00:05:55.021,00:06:01.569,"And this is nuts, but afterwards, we all went to a bar, and I met a guy."
00:06:01.652,00:06:05.364,"I mean, not a guy-guy. I'm married. You all know Doug."
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.493,"Not really, he doesn't come to these, they're not his thing."
00:06:08.576,00:06:09.869,Whose thing are they?
00:06:12.705,00:06:13.748,No offense.
00:06:13.831,00:06:15.041,I like you guys.
00:06:15.124,00:06:16.834,"Marjorie, you."
00:06:16.918,00:06:21.130,"Um, so, Sam. Anyway. Um..."
00:06:21.214,00:06:23.633,"Sam is-- he had a good week, you know?"
00:06:23.716,00:06:36.521,"But the thing is, at this bar, for the first time since, probably, Sam was diagnosed, I wasn't worried or scared."
00:06:36.604,00:06:46.906,I was just having fun with a group of strangers who had nothing to do with autism.
00:06:46.989,00:06:48.825,"And, again, I love you guys."
00:06:48.908,00:06:53.204,"But this guy, this bartender I met, he is so..."
00:06:53.704,00:06:55.498,his life is so crazy!
00:06:55.581,00:07:01.879,"And risk-taking and ordinary, you know?"
00:07:08.553,00:07:10.638,It's just a life Sam's never gonna have.
00:07:14.183,00:07:15.560,"So, um..."
00:07:18.104,00:07:20.064,I don't know. I just...
00:07:25.528,00:07:28.156,"I made lemon squares, um..."
00:07:28.239,00:07:30.575,so don't anybody be shy.
00:07:31.367,00:07:33.119,They're overzested.
00:07:37.874,00:07:41.461,"Your dad's right, bro. A girl is fair game until there's a ring on it."
00:07:41.544,00:07:42.378,A wedding ring.
00:07:42.462,00:07:45.298,An engagement ring means she's ready for one more mistake.
00:07:47.383,00:07:49.093,"Okay, this is perfect."
00:07:51.429,00:07:52.555,Watch this.
00:07:59.020,00:08:02.064,"Of all the people I know, he's the best at girls."
00:08:26.255,00:08:27.465,And that's how you do it.
00:08:28.049,00:08:33.471,"Now I'm gonna hide in the back, 'cause that guy said he's gonna kick my ass, and he has a neck tattoo, so..."
00:08:40.269,00:08:44.023,"-How's Doug? -Oh, we had a date night."
00:08:44.690,00:08:47.693,-Which was a total disaster. -Mm-hmm.
00:08:47.777,00:08:49.612,"Every time we have a moment, I ruin it."
00:08:49.695,00:08:52.490,"Stop it! You're doing great, okay?"
00:08:52.573,00:08:55.993,"I have to say that you're a saint for sticking with him, after what he did."
00:08:56.077,00:08:56.911,Shh!
00:08:58.829,00:09:00.081,That was a long time ago.
00:09:01.374,00:09:04.544,"How's Christopher? I meant to ask you, since he's been mainstreamed."
00:09:05.211,00:09:06.671,He's having a regression.
00:09:07.588,00:09:08.756,Aw.
00:09:08.839,00:09:10.466,Having anger issues.
00:09:12.635,00:09:19.517,"Because I met this woman last year, at the Autism Walk, and I think I might still have her card."
00:09:19.600,00:09:21.227,She has this whole studio.
00:09:21.310,00:09:24.855,"She's a little bit punk rock, but cute as a button."
00:09:24.939,00:09:25.982,And...
00:09:27.900,00:09:29.569,"-Oh, no. -What's wrong?"
00:09:30.236,00:09:36.742,My credit card's-- Cancel card.
00:09:36.826,00:09:38.202,-What's going on? -Ugh!
00:09:40.705,00:09:43.082,I left it at that bar after dance class.
00:09:44.333,00:09:46.043,You're wearing that sweatshirt?
00:09:46.127,00:09:47.837,-What's wrong with it? -Nothing.
00:09:47.920,00:09:52.842,I don't understand why you do all that working out if you're not gonna flaunt your cute figure.
00:09:55.386,00:09:56.637,Why are you canceling it?
00:09:56.721,00:09:57.805,Identity theft.
00:09:57.888,00:10:01.434,"Sweetie, it was a compliment. You're adorable under all that bulk."
00:10:01.517,00:10:02.977,Bye!
00:10:03.060,00:10:05.354,The bar is ten minutes away. Just pick it up.
00:10:05.438,00:10:08.107,No. I'm not gonna add another chore to my to-do list.
00:10:08.190,00:10:10.109,But all the bills are on autopay.
00:10:10.192,00:10:13.613,"Switching everything, that's gonna be like ten chores right there."
00:10:13.696,00:10:14.864,You want me to pick it up?
00:10:14.947,00:10:16.574,-I'll get it on my way to work. -No!
00:10:21.162,00:10:22.413,It's my mistake.
00:10:23.205,00:10:25.207,-I'll take care of it. -You sure?
00:10:26.250,00:10:27.877,I'm sorry that I snapped at you.
00:10:28.502,00:10:31.088,No. I don't even hear it anymore.
00:10:41.307,00:10:43.976,Coach Briggs. You wanted to see me?
00:10:44.060,00:10:45.936,"Yep. Come in, sit."
00:10:46.020,00:10:46.979,Okay.
00:10:48.230,00:10:49.732,We need to powwow.
00:10:50.232,00:10:54.070,"If this is about my suspension, I'm so sorry."
00:10:54.153,00:10:59.408,"I really-- This team is very important to me, and I would never do anything to mess that up."
00:10:59.492,00:11:01.952,"Gardner, look at this office."
00:11:04.413,00:11:05.748,My life is not awesome.
00:11:05.831,00:11:08.125,Do you know the one thing that brings me joy?
00:11:08.209,00:11:10.086,Other than the failures of my brother?
00:11:12.088,00:11:15.007,It is girls with actual talent.
00:11:15.549,00:11:17.093,-Like you! -Mm-hmm.
00:11:18.469,00:11:20.888,I took a risk bringing you onto varsity so young.
00:11:20.971,00:11:23.474,-Don't make me regret it. -I won't.
00:11:23.557,00:11:26.394,And if there's anything that I can do to make it up to you...
00:11:26.477,00:11:27.978,There is.
00:11:28.062,00:11:31.148,The girl you went gangster on was our biggest booster's daughter.
00:11:31.816,00:11:38.072,"Every year, her parents charter us a bus to get us to semis, but this year they won't do it until you apologize to their kid."
00:11:38.739,00:11:39.907,Apologize?
00:11:40.658,00:11:42.576,Shouldn't she for what she did to Beth?
00:11:43.244,00:11:44.203,It's up to you.
00:11:44.286,00:11:48.124,Your teammates won't be thrilled when they find out they lost their bus.
00:11:49.083,00:11:50.418,But you're probably fine.
00:11:50.501,00:11:54.046,People always talk about how nice and humane teenage girls are to each other.
00:11:57.633,00:12:03.681,"Anyway, I shouldn't have punched you in the face, no matter how shitty you were being, and I am sorry."
00:12:05.641,00:12:07.810,Your eye's looking better. It's almost normal.
00:12:09.645,00:12:11.522,Wow. You suck at apologies.
00:12:11.605,00:12:14.150,"Yeah, I know that about myself. So are we cool?"
00:12:14.233,00:12:17.736,"Look, I know your brother has major problems."
00:12:18.779,00:12:20.865,You must have a lot of anger about that.
00:12:24.618,00:12:28.747,"Look, I know you're only apologizing to me to get your bus back."
00:12:29.415,00:12:31.625,I accept that. Bus is yours.
00:12:31.709,00:12:33.169,No number twos in the bathroom.
00:12:34.712,00:12:36.088,"Oh, and, um..."
00:12:36.672,00:12:38.299,I heard you're seeing Evan Chapin.
00:12:38.966,00:12:40.509,That is so brave.
00:12:41.093,00:12:43.053,Most people would be scared to go there.
00:12:43.137,00:12:44.513,But not you.
00:12:44.597,00:12:45.806,Bye!
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.191,I need my lunch money.
00:12:55.274,00:12:56.775,"God, I hate that skank!"
00:12:57.485,00:12:59.904,Skank? Do you mean she's promiscuous?
00:12:59.987,00:13:01.405,"No, she's just annoying."
00:13:01.489,00:13:03.866,"Why do you make things so literal? God, you suck!"
00:13:05.826,00:13:07.953,Find me if you don't have anyone to eat with.
00:13:08.037,00:13:09.038,Okay.
00:13:21.634,00:13:23.302,You want to know how to steal a girl?
00:13:23.385,00:13:26.514,"Well, get your GPS ready, because I'm taking you to Poon City."
00:13:27.306,00:13:28.599,That's not a real place.
00:13:28.682,00:13:31.352,"Yes, it is. And I'm the mayor."
00:13:32.019,00:13:34.813,"Step one, be hella charming."
00:13:35.648,00:13:44.240,"Julia, did you know that, when Roald Amundsen trekked Antarctica, he would feed his weaker sled dogs to the stronger ones so they could travel more efficiently?"
00:13:44.323,00:13:46.283,He made them cannibalize each other.
00:13:46.367,00:13:47.368,What?
00:13:49.203,00:13:50.579,What's your favorite meal?
00:13:50.663,00:13:54.208,"Step two, find out what sucks about her current boyfriend."
00:13:54.291,00:13:56.418,But be subtle about it.
00:13:56.502,00:13:59.505,"Julia, what are Miles's three biggest weaknesses?"
00:13:59.588,00:14:02.132,"Feel free to list more than three, if you have them."
00:14:03.384,00:14:07.513,"And step three, the most important thing: chocolate..."
00:14:07.596,00:14:08.681,covered...
00:14:08.764,00:14:10.140,strawberries.
00:14:10.224,00:14:12.977,"Makes girls horny as hell, and that's science."
00:14:13.060,00:14:15.020,Science requires empirical evidence.
00:14:15.688,00:14:18.983,The evidence is her panties on the floor of my kitchenette.
00:14:19.984,00:14:22.319,That's anecdotal and pseudoscientific.
00:14:22.403,00:14:24.363,"Just get the damn berries, homey."
00:14:34.832,00:14:35.666,Hey.
00:14:36.458,00:14:39.128,"Oh, cool shirt. Pharcyde."
00:14:39.211,00:14:40.546,I saw those guys in '96.
00:14:40.629,00:14:42.840,I was the whitest guy in the audience.
00:14:42.923,00:14:47.011,You may be the whitest guy everywhere. I'll get you a drink in five when we open.
00:14:47.094,00:14:49.889,I'm not here for a drink. I'm here to pick up a credit card.
00:14:49.972,00:14:51.932,The name is Elsa Gardner.
00:14:54.310,00:14:59.273,"Look, man, this is gonna sound like I'm being a dick, but I can only give it to the cardholder."
00:14:59.356,00:15:00.566,It's policy.
00:15:00.649,00:15:04.737,Can you make an exception for a guy trying to score points with his wife?
00:15:04.820,00:15:06.655,We had a meeting about it last week.
00:15:06.739,00:15:08.282,"-I really can't. -Come on, man."
00:15:08.365,00:15:09.992,"Look, I'm gonna call her."
00:15:10.701,00:15:12.828,"You could talk to her, just to verify."
00:15:12.912,00:15:14.079,I understand.
00:15:20.961,00:15:22.755,"Hey, hon. What's going on?"
00:15:24.632,00:15:27.343,Trying to get your credit card. Can you talk to this guy?
00:15:30.012,00:15:31.764,Just talk to her. She'll tell you.
00:15:32.431,00:15:33.432,Hello. It's Nick.
00:15:38.979,00:15:40.147,There's no one there.
00:15:40.230,00:15:41.440,Hello?
00:15:44.068,00:15:46.570,-So you won't help me out? -Sorry. I really can't.
00:15:47.988,00:15:49.114,Thanks for everything.
00:15:53.786,00:15:55.996,Do you know why Evan got kicked out of school?
00:15:59.249,00:16:01.251,But there are a lot of rumors.
00:16:01.335,00:16:05.214,"I heard he was selling meth to all the band kids, and that's why they suck."
00:16:05.297,00:16:09.009,"I heard he had sex with Courtney B's mom, and Courtney A walked in on them."
00:16:09.093,00:16:11.929,I heard he dressed as a wolf for Halloween and ate a sheep.
00:16:12.012,00:16:15.683,-That's probably not true. -I don't know. People eat gross stuff.
00:16:15.766,00:16:18.060,It must've been bad for him to get arrested.
00:16:19.019,00:16:20.854,-Arrested? -Yeah.
00:16:20.938,00:16:22.272,You never heard any of this?
00:16:22.356,00:16:25.401,-Casey's just a sophomore. -Yeah. I forget.
00:16:28.696,00:16:29.822,Little baby.
00:16:38.163,00:16:39.039,"Yo, brotha."
00:16:55.764,00:16:57.224,you have to ask questions.
00:17:00.477,00:17:01.395,Excuse me. Bailey?
00:17:02.688,00:17:05.149,I'm the boy whose sister punched you.
00:17:05.232,00:17:09.153,"I noticed yesterday you were kissing Henry and today, you're kissing Arlo."
00:17:09.236,00:17:12.322,"And I was wondering, how did he woo you?"
00:17:12.406,00:17:14.575,"And, please, be specific."
00:17:15.159,00:17:16.660,"Dude, what the hell?"
00:17:17.661,00:17:24.168,"I'm doing research on how to steal a woman, and Bailey is the perfect test subject, because she's a skank."
00:17:26.795,00:17:30.007,So you're doing research on how to steal a woman? Awesome!
00:17:30.090,00:17:31.383,"Arlo, be nice."
00:17:31.467,00:17:33.802,-You tryin' to get laid? -You gonna tap some ass?
00:17:36.305,00:17:38.015,"No. He means pussy, bro."
00:17:38.974,00:17:40.184,I'm not a fan of cats.
00:17:41.810,00:17:44.271,"I mean, I guess cats are okay."
00:17:44.354,00:17:50.152,"I'm more into birds than felines and, especially, I'll say flightless birds are cool."
00:17:50.235,00:17:51.987,What kind of girl you lookin' for?
00:17:52.071,00:17:54.031,Or do you wanna bang a flightless bird?
00:17:55.115,00:17:56.116,Of course not.
00:17:59.328,00:18:00.871,"That's enough, guys."
00:18:07.211,00:18:11.465,"I just don't always know why, which, in some ways, is worse."
00:18:13.592,00:18:14.927,"No, just read it out."
00:18:15.010,00:18:17.012,We'll keep it a secret between us.
00:18:17.096,00:18:19.348,Can he handle a girl like Bailey?
00:18:25.729,00:18:27.815,-It's all good. -Who's the lucky girl?
00:18:27.898,00:18:30.651,"-Come on. -Oh, my-- Guys, leave him alone!"
00:18:30.734,00:18:31.819,He's not all there!
00:18:53.549,00:18:54.591,Honey?
00:18:59.721,00:19:02.224,I had to pick him up at school. There was an incident.
00:19:02.891,00:19:04.852,He's been silent. He won't talk to me.
00:19:04.935,00:19:07.146,He's locked in his room. I don't know what's going on.
00:19:07.229,00:19:09.481,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:19:11.942,00:19:14.027,"Sam, honey, thank God. Are you okay?"
00:19:14.945,00:19:16.113,I want to talk to Dad.
00:19:17.656,00:19:18.699,Really?
00:19:18.782,00:19:19.908,Right.
00:19:20.909,00:19:22.494,"Sure. Of course, honey."
00:19:24.079,00:19:26.248,We've been getting along lately.
00:19:26.331,00:19:28.250,"It's what you wanted, right?"
00:19:28.333,00:19:29.835,Yeah. It's great.
00:19:29.918,00:19:32.296,It's really good. Really good. Um...
00:19:33.881,00:19:35.007,so I should just...
00:19:35.090,00:19:37.009,Go to the bar and get your credit card.
00:19:37.926,00:19:43.599,"Okay? And, by the time you get back, we'll either be better, or we'll really need your help."
00:19:49.271,00:19:50.397,Call if you need me.
00:19:50.480,00:19:51.523,"Nobody needs you, Mom."
00:20:00.616,00:20:01.617,Hey.
00:20:02.451,00:20:05.370,"Did, um, something happen at school?"
00:20:05.454,00:20:06.663,Yes.
00:20:08.123,00:20:09.541,You wanna talk about it?
00:20:09.625,00:20:10.667,Yes.
00:20:11.960,00:20:13.045,Okay.
00:20:15.923,00:20:16.798,Now?
00:20:18.467,00:20:22.012,I was doing what you said and formulating a plan to steal a woman.
00:20:24.306,00:20:31.688,"And I was simply taking notes, and these guys were laughing at me and asking questions, and I don't know what was funny."
00:20:34.441,00:20:36.109,and then Bailey Bennet...
00:20:38.654,00:20:40.864,"Well, I am all there. I am!"
00:20:41.531,00:20:42.699,I know you are.
00:20:44.284,00:20:46.286,"Some kids are just assholes, Sam."
00:20:46.370,00:20:48.497,That's just the way it is.
00:20:48.580,00:20:52.000,But even the assholes get girlfriends.
00:20:52.084,00:20:54.086,"It's easy for everybody, but not me."
00:20:54.169,00:20:55.504,"No, it's not."
00:20:55.587,00:20:57.631,Trust me. It's hard for everybody.
00:20:57.714,00:21:00.926,Not you. You stole Mom from the boy with the Jeep.
00:21:01.635,00:21:04.096,"Look, maybe I made that seem a little bit too easy."
00:21:04.179,00:21:10.560,"Even after your mom got rid of that other goofball, she shot me down like ten times, okay?"
00:21:10.644,00:21:12.271,That's just the way it works.
00:21:12.354,00:21:14.815,"The point is, is you just don't give up."
00:21:18.735,00:21:21.697,"So, you think I could get a girl to like me?"
00:21:23.240,00:21:24.199,Of course I do.
00:21:33.500,00:21:37.129,Then we're gonna need some chocolate-covered strawberries.
00:21:47.723,00:21:49.474,"Hey, Mr. Free Spirit."
00:21:49.558,00:21:51.018,Climb any mountains lately?
00:21:53.687,00:21:55.397,Oh. I'm sorry!
00:21:55.480,00:21:58.066,I thought you were someone else. Um...
00:21:59.443,00:22:01.611,I left my card here the other night.
00:22:01.695,00:22:02.612,Elsa Gardner?
00:22:08.452,00:22:09.911,Gardner. Here you go.
00:22:10.954,00:22:13.165,Yep! That's me.
00:22:13.248,00:22:14.333,Great.
00:22:15.917,00:22:19.629,"Yeah. That's what I came here for, so..."
00:22:21.423,00:22:22.674,Excuse me.
00:22:23.300,00:22:24.426,Is Nick here?
00:22:24.509,00:22:25.510,Sir?
00:23:03.215,00:23:04.257,Oh.
00:23:13.308,00:23:17.479,All right. You're gonna get out of the car and give that girl those strawberries.
00:23:18.146,00:23:21.108,Then the ball's in her court. You've done all you can.
00:23:26.321,00:23:27.239,"Go get her, Sam."
00:23:28.323,00:23:30.117,I am. That's why we're here.
00:23:44.047,00:23:45.006,"No, no, no, no."
00:23:45.090,00:23:47.008,Sam. Sam!
00:23:51.513,00:23:53.098,"No, no, no, no. Sam! Sam!"
00:24:05.569,00:24:07.696,-Sam! What are you doing? -What do you mean?
00:24:07.779,00:24:09.823,You can't climb through people's windows.
00:24:09.906,00:24:12.200,"Well, I couldn't ring the doorbell."
00:24:12.284,00:24:16.955,"Her boyfriend works weird hours, so she doesn't like people at the door 'cause he may be sleeping."
00:24:17.038,00:24:18.206,It's one of their rules.
00:24:18.290,00:24:19.791,I like rules.
00:24:19.875,00:24:21.751,They make things clear.
00:24:21.835,00:24:24.462,"Before I do something, I like to know all the rules."
00:24:24.546,00:24:27.465,A boyfriend? What teenager lives with her boyfriend?
00:24:28.216,00:24:30.969,Julia's not a teenager. She's 26 3/4.
00:24:32.971,00:24:36.266,"Julia, your therapist? Sam, let's go."
00:24:36.349,00:24:38.602,"Get out. Come on, let's go! Let's go!"
00:24:48.320,00:24:50.947,Whoa! This is a nice backyard!
00:24:51.031,00:24:52.532,You could put a pool back here.
00:24:52.616,00:24:54.159,Above-ground pools are cheap.
00:24:54.242,00:24:58.622,"You could build a deck around it, make it feel like a in-ground pool and..."
00:25:00.582,00:25:04.836,That's sort of all I've gotta say about pools.
00:25:05.503,00:25:06.504,But...
00:25:08.256,00:25:09.758,maybe you could talk now?
00:25:10.425,00:25:11.426,Okay.
00:25:12.844,00:25:14.387,Why did you get kicked out of my school?
00:25:15.555,00:25:16.389,What?
00:25:16.473,00:25:19.226,"I heard you got kicked out, and everybody has a theory."
00:25:19.309,00:25:20.143,What did you do?
00:25:20.227,00:25:23.563,Did you steal the principal's car? Were you freebasing in the chem lab?
00:25:23.647,00:25:25.690,"-No, nothing like that. -What happened?"
00:25:25.774,00:25:27.859,It doesn't matter. It was a long time ago.
00:25:27.943,00:25:30.278,"-Well, it matters to me. -Why?"
00:25:30.362,00:25:33.698,"I can't get in trouble and if I keep hanging out with you, I will."
00:25:34.532,00:25:37.077,-Why can't you just tell me? -Because it's stupid.
00:25:38.119,00:25:40.497,"-Okay, just go home. -Come on, Casey!"
00:25:41.081,00:25:42.249,I stole a tuba!
00:25:46.878,00:25:47.712,What?
00:25:49.881,00:25:51.299,I stole a tuba.
00:25:52.467,00:25:53.802,And a trombone.
00:25:54.636,00:25:56.680,And then a couple saxophones.
00:25:58.807,00:26:04.354,"I broke into the band room one day after school, and I took some musical instruments."
00:26:05.188,00:26:06.898,And then I tried to pawn them.
00:26:06.982,00:26:10.735,I didn't really have a good reason why.
00:26:10.819,00:26:13.905,They left the band room unlocked. I guess that's the reason.
00:26:14.656,00:26:15.740,"Anyway, never mind."
00:26:16.533,00:26:18.743,"Ninety minutes later, cops are at my door."
00:26:18.827,00:26:20.620,They put me in cuffs.
00:26:20.704,00:26:26.376,"And since I stole stuff from the school that I go to, you know, like a genius..."
00:26:26.459,00:26:28.295,I also got expelled.
00:26:29.963,00:26:31.381,So there it is.
00:26:32.007,00:26:33.842,That's the full story. I hope you're happy.
00:26:38.096,00:26:41.725,Are you serious? You stole musical instruments?
00:26:41.808,00:26:44.561,-That's what you did? -Yeah. I told you it was stupid.
00:26:45.729,00:26:46.771,Why are you laughing?
00:26:46.855,00:26:48.440,Because that is hilarious!
00:26:48.523,00:26:51.359,"Because everyone thinks you're, like, a total badass."
00:26:51.443,00:26:54.112,-How did you carry them all? -I brought my wagon.
00:26:54.195,00:26:56.197,"God, this just gets better and better."
00:26:56.281,00:26:58.700,I can't believe you're laughing at me right now.
00:26:59.659,00:27:02.871,I knew that was a mistake. I shouldn't have told you. You know what?
00:27:02.954,00:27:05.040,I gotta pick up my sister from the library.
00:27:05.123,00:27:09.377,"I didn't mean-- Evan, wait."
00:27:09.461,00:27:10.420,What?
00:27:28.480,00:27:30.148,Whoa.
00:27:30.231,00:27:31.191,I know.
00:27:35.403,00:27:36.780,"Well, I should go."
00:27:37.989,00:27:41.326,"Feels like awkward timing now, but I..."
00:27:41.409,00:27:42.744,"Yeah, you should."
00:27:42.827,00:27:44.996,"-Yeah, go. -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
00:28:03.848,00:28:05.975,That dart was awfully pointy and sharp.
00:28:06.059,00:28:11.064,"You think there'd be, like, regulations, you know, about things like that in a public place."
00:28:11.147,00:28:12.649,"It's a health hazard, right?"
00:28:13.650,00:28:14.692,Totally agree.
00:28:14.776,00:28:18.947,"Well, you have inebriated people throwing weapons across a room."
00:28:19.030,00:28:21.366,"I mean, it's kinda dangerous, right?"
00:28:23.076,00:28:24.119,-Um... -Yeah?
00:28:24.202,00:28:26.371,-I can't really get at the... -What?
00:28:26.454,00:28:27.914,Your shirt's in the way.
00:28:28.623,00:28:30.291,Of course. Yeah.
00:28:40.927,00:28:41.803,There you go.
00:28:43.304,00:28:44.514,Ah!
00:28:44.597,00:28:46.474,Okay. Okay.
00:28:51.521,00:28:53.732,Put a little Neosporin on it.
00:29:02.073,00:29:03.366,This stuff doesn't go bad.
00:29:03.450,00:29:04.951,Uh-huh. Right.
00:29:05.034,00:29:10.874,"They just have so much room on that tiny, one-inch tube that they put non-pertinent, haphazard information."
00:29:14.878,00:29:16.379,I've never met anyone like you.
00:29:16.463,00:29:17.672,Huh.
00:29:22.802,00:29:24.596,And you're all set.
00:29:27.307,00:29:29.100,You can put your shirt back on.
00:29:34.564,00:29:37.734,"You know, we should exchange numbers."
00:29:39.027,00:29:42.238,Just in case there's side effects from that expired Neosporin.
00:29:47.410,00:29:51.498,"Listen, I really think you need to let this thing with Julia go."
00:29:52.540,00:29:53.625,Why?
00:29:54.375,00:29:56.169,"First, she's a lot older than you."
00:29:56.252,00:30:04.177,"Plus, if you tell her how you really feel, it's gonna be a conflict of interest and she's not gonna be able to be your therapist anymore."
00:30:04.803,00:30:06.179,But I need her as my therapist.
00:30:06.262,00:30:07.639,"Well, great."
00:30:07.722,00:30:10.266,Then you should start dating someone your own age.
00:30:12.393,00:30:14.979,Like a practice girlfriend before I date Julia?
00:30:15.063,00:30:17.398,No. I wouldn't call it that.
00:30:17.482,00:30:24.322,"When Roald Amundsen first explored Antarctica, he took several practice journeys over easier terrain."
00:30:24.405,00:30:26.491,It's the logical thing to do.
00:30:26.574,00:30:32.413,"And when I get enough experience with other girls, then I can date Julia and she can stop being my therapist."
00:30:32.497,00:30:36.376,Or you could find a girl your own age.
00:30:37.377,00:30:41.422,"That's your sweet spot. Plus, those are the girls that are gonna like you, too."
00:30:44.551,00:30:46.386,That's excellent advice. Thank you.
00:30:49.597,00:30:50.807,Anytime.
00:30:58.314,00:30:59.607,"Hey, Dad?"
00:30:59.691,00:31:01.776,Are you gonna tell Mom about Julia?
00:31:03.903,00:31:04.946,"No, thank you."
00:31:06.447,00:31:08.283,"All right, well, then it's between us."
00:31:11.286,00:31:15.790,"I'm not trying to brag here, but I had a really good day with Sam."
00:31:15.874,00:31:17.125,"You know, he's a good kid."
00:31:17.792,00:31:19.544,What happened to your arm?
00:31:19.627,00:31:20.920,"Oh, nothing."
00:31:21.004,00:31:23.423,I just scraped it on a nail in the garage.
00:31:23.506,00:31:26.050,You gotta show me where it is so I can pound it down.
00:31:26.134,00:31:28.761,"-Did you put something on it? -Yeah, Neosporin."
00:31:28.845,00:31:30.722,"It was expired, but..."
00:31:30.805,00:31:32.390,That stuff doesn't expire.
00:31:32.473,00:31:34.475,It just gets less effective the more it sits around.
00:31:42.191,00:31:43.443,What's that for?
00:31:43.526,00:31:44.944,'Cause I'm such a good dad?
00:31:45.028,00:31:46.821,"-Yeah, you're Super Dad. -Yeah?"
00:31:46.905,00:31:49.032,You gonna get me a cape that says Super Dad?
00:31:49.115,00:31:51.284,Not now. Get the light.
00:32:00.752,00:32:04.589,"No matter how far an albatross flies, it always returns home."
00:32:05.340,00:32:09.177,Unless it flies too close to the water and gets eaten by a tiger shark.
00:00:22.605,00:00:26.693,"I know Clayton Prep has that one speedy Mexican girl, but I know you could beat her."
00:00:28.486,00:00:31.448,Are you offended I called her Mexican? 'Cause she actually is.
00:00:31.531,00:00:32.365,I kissed a boy.
00:00:34.701,00:00:35.744,Wow.
00:00:36.327,00:00:37.203,That's something.
00:00:37.954,00:00:43.001,"Yeah, I wasn't gonna tell you, but you're kind of my go-to, which makes me feel like a loser."
00:00:43.084,00:00:46.463,"Wow. That's your first kiss, huh?"
00:00:46.546,00:00:47.714,That's...
00:00:47.797,00:00:49.299,That's a big deal.
00:00:49.382,00:00:51.801,"-Oh, God, you're being weird. -I'm not being weird."
00:00:51.885,00:00:55.138,"You are. You're running away from me, moving your arms weird."
00:00:55.221,00:00:57.307,"No, I'm not. I'm just gangly."
00:00:58.016,00:00:59.059,It's how I run.
00:00:59.642,00:01:01.394,Wait a second. Hold on a second.
00:01:05.607,00:01:08.109,What school does he go to? What do you guys do together?
00:01:08.610,00:01:09.778,How tall is he?
00:01:09.861,00:01:12.489,"His name is Evan, and he goes to tech school."
00:01:12.572,00:01:15.366,And we mostly just hang out at Kennedy Park.
00:01:16.034,00:01:19.079,-And he's coming over to do homework. -Homework?
00:01:19.162,00:01:21.539,What kind of homework do they give at the tech school?
00:01:21.623,00:01:23.958,-Can he fix our AC? -Can we stop talking about this?
00:01:24.042,00:01:25.210,Casey?
00:01:26.753,00:01:28.046,"Casey, wait up!"
00:01:39.474,00:01:40.558,was an idiot.
00:01:41.935,00:01:45.522,"Humans can't be perfect, because we're not machines."
00:01:45.605,00:01:52.112,"Unfortunately, the best thing that you can say about practice is that it makes... better."
00:01:52.946,00:01:58.993,"Which is why I know that in order to be a good boyfriend to Julia, I need a practice girlfriend first."
00:01:59.953,00:02:02.622,You get good at something when you do it repeatedly...
00:02:05.041,00:02:06.876,when you get into a routine.
00:03:16.070,00:03:18.823,Why does my to-do list say Remove stick from butt!?
00:03:18.907,00:03:20.158,I don't know.
00:03:20.241,00:03:22.285,"But if it's on there, you got to do it, right?"
00:03:22.368,00:03:25.204,You guys need fuel after your run? I made cinnamon buns.
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.331,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:03:29.459,00:03:40.762,"Did you know there are 432 girls at our school and 91 of them have a name that starts with an M, which is 21%, and the national average is only... 9%?"
00:03:40.845,00:03:42.680,I 100% don't care.
00:03:43.389,00:03:45.516,"-Boop! -Cool fact, buddy."
00:03:45.600,00:03:48.561,I'm going to the mall later. Does anybody need anything?
00:03:50.647,00:03:54.067,"No, Mom, but thanks for everything you do."
00:04:12.835,00:04:18.049,with a picture of a western honeybee on it that said Bee mine. B-e-e.
00:04:18.132,00:04:24.138,"I didn't understand why the word be was misspelled, but she was nice and explained it to me."
00:04:25.390,00:04:27.225,That's the first joke I ever learned.
00:04:30.728,00:04:32.730,"Hey, Madison. Bee mine."
00:04:33.690,00:04:35.233,Um... what?
00:04:36.067,00:04:37.443,Would you like to go on a date?
00:04:39.570,00:04:41.197,"That's so nice, but I'm busy."
00:04:42.365,00:04:43.199,Okay.
00:04:48.579,00:04:50.748,Wait. I didn't tell you when the date is.
00:04:50.832,00:04:52.750,"Friday, 6:00 p.m., Eastern."
00:04:52.834,00:04:53.960,I'm still busy.
00:04:54.043,00:04:55.211,Okay.
00:04:58.756,00:05:01.884,I also forgot to tell you that you would be my practice girlfriend.
00:05:01.968,00:05:05.430,"The person I really like is Julia, my therapist, if that makes it better."
00:05:06.180,00:05:07.432,It makes it worse.
00:05:07.515,00:05:10.184,"If Friday is bad, I could do Thursday instead."
00:05:10.268,00:05:12.061,My God! I don't want to go out with you.
00:05:12.145,00:05:14.063,-Why not? -Because...
00:05:15.064,00:05:18.985,"Look, no offense at all... at all, at all..."
00:05:19.068,00:05:21.321,but... you're really weird.
00:05:21.404,00:05:23.323,And you wear the same clothes every day.
00:05:23.406,00:05:28.328,"I also have this guy from camp that I haven't seen in a while, but we text all the time..."
00:05:33.583,00:05:34.751,I need new clothes.
00:05:35.626,00:05:37.128,Okay. How come?
00:05:37.795,00:05:42.008,Girls seem to like it when boys wear more than one type of shirt. Why is that?
00:05:42.842,00:05:46.304,I guess to get a sense of your style. It says something about a person.
00:05:46.971,00:05:50.224,Like how some iguanas flare their colorful dewlaps to attract a mate.
00:05:50.933,00:05:52.435,Exactly... like that.
00:05:53.394,00:05:54.270,I think.
00:05:54.937,00:05:57.148,How do you currently pick out your clothes?
00:05:57.815,00:06:01.194,I don't. My mom does. Doesn't your mom pick out your clothes?
00:06:04.530,00:06:08.034,I think maybe it's time to start picking out your own clothes.
00:06:10.078,00:06:11.704,But... how?
00:06:13.831,00:06:18.503,And different colors and patterns and sizes.
00:06:18.586,00:06:24.133,"This shirt is called fog gray, but fog isn't even a color... it's translucent."
00:06:24.842,00:06:27.095,Just pick something that feels like you.
00:06:27.178,00:06:30.389,"Once you live on your own, you'll need to choose your own clothes."
00:06:31.099,00:06:33.142,"You can do this, Sam."
00:06:33.226,00:06:35.019,There's a stylish dude in there.
00:06:36.896,00:06:37.939,"You mean me, right?"
00:06:38.731,00:06:39.774,I do.
00:06:45.029,00:06:46.614,"So, Casey has a boyfriend."
00:06:48.241,00:06:51.035,"Oh, no. It's okay. Casey's got a good head on her shoulders."
00:06:53.704,00:06:56.082,"She told me about it, so that's a good thing, right?"
00:06:56.165,00:06:57.959,I'm sure I got nothing to worry about.
00:06:58.042,00:07:00.294,That's the same thing I said about my daughter.
00:07:00.378,00:07:02.130,It's fun being a grandfather.
00:07:02.213,00:07:03.422,You'll like it.
00:07:31.701,00:07:33.369,"Mom, I want to go shopping with you."
00:07:33.453,00:07:34.537,What?
00:07:34.620,00:07:36.664,You're going to the mall. I want to come.
00:07:36.747,00:07:38.875,I love spending time with you. You know that.
00:07:38.958,00:07:41.294,But it's easier if I go to the mall by myself.
00:07:41.377,00:07:46.424,But Julia says I need to learn how to do my own shopping for when I live by myself one day.
00:07:46.507,00:07:52.638,"Well, that's fine, and that's good for Julia to say, but she wasn't with us the last time we went to the mall."
00:07:52.722,00:08:01.272,"It was so overwhelming, with all the sounds and the lights and, God, that awful fountain with the water going every which way."
00:08:01.355,00:08:02.482,I hated that fountain.
00:08:02.565,00:08:03.566,"Yeah, you did."
00:08:03.649,00:08:07.320,"And you ended up getting upset, and do you remember what happened?"
00:08:08.905,00:08:12.617,"I slapped the nice man at Panda Express, and then we got banned forever."
00:08:13.284,00:08:14.785,And we love their Kung Pao chicken.
00:08:16.204,00:08:17.121,But...
00:08:17.914,00:08:19.123,Julia thinks I'm ready.
00:08:19.207,00:08:20.124,How about this?
00:08:20.208,00:08:26.339,"How about if I see anything that's cute, I'll take a picture on my phone and send it to you, and then you can shop from the comfort of home?"
00:08:26.422,00:08:28.090,"Pretty great idea, right?"
00:08:28.716,00:08:29.634,No.
00:08:29.717,00:08:32.720,"Mom, I'm not a little kid anymore."
00:08:32.803,00:08:34.680,I can go shopping.
00:08:34.764,00:08:35.932,I can do things.
00:08:37.308,00:08:38.643,Of course you can.
00:08:40.311,00:08:41.562,All right.
00:08:42.230,00:08:44.273,"I'll finish up here, and we'll go, okay?"
00:08:45.858,00:08:47.902,You want to help me put away the groceries?
00:08:47.985,00:08:48.945,No.
00:08:54.992,00:08:56.577,"Yeah, we pride ourselves on that."
00:08:56.661,00:08:58.371,"-Can we be done now? -No, no, no."
00:08:58.454,00:09:02.166,"Oh, look at you in this one. Look at you scowling!"
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.626,"Yeah, I was annoyed."
00:09:03.709,00:09:08.839,"My mom plans this autism walk every year, and makes us take a picture to remember how sweaty we are."
00:09:08.923,00:09:10.007,"Oh, man."
00:09:10.091,00:09:11.467,These are great.
00:09:14.136,00:09:16.472,"Hey, where's your dad in this one?"
00:09:17.640,00:09:19.559,That's weird. My mom never lets us skip.
00:09:19.642,00:09:22.353,"When I had appendicitis, she told me to walk it off."
00:09:33.114,00:09:33.948,Dad.
00:09:34.031,00:09:35.533,This is... Evan.
00:09:35.616,00:09:38.035,"Hey. It's nice to meet you, sir."
00:09:38.119,00:09:39.287,Thanks for stopping by.
00:09:44.792,00:09:47.628,"Dad, why weren't you at the autism walk in 2004?"
00:09:47.712,00:09:48.546,Huh?
00:09:49.213,00:09:51.632,-You're not in the picture. -Oh. I don't know.
00:09:51.716,00:09:54.135,I think I had a work thing.
00:09:54.218,00:09:56.262,Really? Mom let you skip it for a work thing?
00:09:56.345,00:09:57.597,Yeah.
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.849,"So, you guys all done studying?"
00:09:59.932,00:10:01.100,Is Evan ready to go?
00:10:01.183,00:10:04.562,"-No, he's gonna take me to track practice. -I can take you."
00:10:04.645,00:10:06.272,"Well, I don't need you to. He is."
00:10:06.355,00:10:08.816,"-Oh, Evan drives? You drive? -Yes."
00:10:08.899,00:10:10.484,-How's your record? -Clean.
00:10:10.568,00:10:12.778,-Parking tickets? Traffic violations? -Mnh-mnh.
00:10:12.862,00:10:14.572,-Parole? None of that? -No.
00:10:14.655,00:10:15.781,-He stole a tuba. -Casey.
00:10:15.865,00:10:17.950,"What's that mean, tuba? What's that, slang?"
00:10:20.703,00:10:23.122,-Maybe you should get going. -Dad!
00:10:24.123,00:10:25.374,Can we have a second?
00:10:25.458,00:10:27.043,-Yeah. I'll be in the car. -Yeah.
00:10:30.087,00:10:32.089,-What the hell? -I say that to you.
00:10:32.173,00:10:35.635,What are you doing? Coming home early. All up in my face. Acting like Mom.
00:10:35.718,00:10:37.928,"You know, I love your mom, but that's a low blow."
00:10:38.012,00:10:41.223,"Okay, I just-- You know, I get worried about you."
00:10:41.307,00:10:43.643,I don't want you distracted.
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.561,I don't want you to screw up your track career.
00:10:45.645,00:10:47.146,I'm not. Track is important to me.
00:10:47.229,00:10:49.273,-Is it? -Yeah. Stop acting like a lunatic.
00:10:49.357,00:10:51.901,"We're gonna talk about that tuba thing later, too."
00:11:10.753,00:11:11.962,Okay.
00:11:12.046,00:11:13.672,-Thanks for the ride. -Yeah.
00:11:13.756,00:11:16.467,We could've walked here faster. You drive like my nana.
00:11:16.550,00:11:18.344,Have you seen my car?
00:11:18.427,00:11:20.971,"If I drive too fast, pieces fall off."
00:11:23.432,00:11:26.143,"So... that was weird with your dad, right?"
00:11:27.144,00:11:28.854,Yeah. He's just being stupid.
00:11:28.938,00:11:31.774,That's the way dads are with boys their daughters are dating.
00:11:31.857,00:11:33.025,"No, I get that."
00:11:33.109,00:11:35.653,"I mean, him lying about missing the autism walk."
00:11:39.698,00:11:41.200,"I mean, it was obvious."
00:11:41.283,00:11:43.786,"Casey, I... I had a work thing."
00:11:43.869,00:11:45.204,You know?
00:11:45.287,00:11:46.497,You don't even know my dad.
00:11:47.206,00:11:50.960,"Maybe not, but I've got a lot of experience with lying fathers."
00:11:51.710,00:11:52.586,And mothers.
00:11:53.087,00:11:53.963,And uncles.
00:11:54.046,00:11:56.424,Even my dog pretends he has to go out when he doesn't.
00:11:56.507,00:12:00.136,"All right, well, I'm sorry about your dad, but my dad wouldn't lie."
00:12:00.219,00:12:03.305,That's not the way he is. He's the only one in my family that gets me.
00:12:03.389,00:12:06.100,"And honestly, if he's acting a little aggro..."
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.520,it's probably because I told him about our kiss.
00:12:09.603,00:12:10.521,Hmm.
00:12:11.105,00:12:12.982,You told your dad that we kissed. Okay.
00:12:13.065,00:12:16.569,"Yeah. See, that's exactly my point. We're honest with each other."
00:12:16.652,00:12:18.571,Good. That's good.
00:12:22.324,00:12:23.409,He didn't lie.
00:12:31.667,00:12:33.127,It's like...
00:12:33.210,00:12:35.379,-Do you want your sunglasses? -No.
00:12:36.630,00:12:39.508,Boop! Boop! Boop! Does that sound annoying?
00:12:39.592,00:12:42.344,-When you make it. -Do you want your headphones?
00:12:42.428,00:12:43.637,No. I'm fine.
00:12:44.680,00:12:46.932,Okay. Great. Okay.
00:12:47.016,00:12:52.980,"Well, we'll just grab a few things Oh, it's gonna be sweet, all right."
00:12:53.063,00:12:55.316,Zahid. You're here.
00:12:55.399,00:12:56.275,Zahid's here.
00:12:56.358,00:12:59.695,"I invited Zahid, because he's the most stylish person I know."
00:12:59.820,00:13:01.238,Sometimes he wears two watches.
00:13:01.906,00:13:03.699,I think I'm also quite stylish.
00:13:04.700,00:13:06.368,"Bring it in, Mrs. G."
00:13:07.745,00:13:09.288,Mm. Nice.
00:13:09.997,00:13:12.082,Long hug. Okay. Thank you.
00:13:12.166,00:13:13.501,You smell amazing.
00:13:13.584,00:13:17.296,"Um... hey, Sam. This would look very handsome on you."
00:13:17.379,00:13:18.506,You're such a winter.
00:13:18.589,00:13:20.466,Julia says I need to pick my own clothes.
00:13:21.634,00:13:22.718,"Well, screw Julia."
00:13:23.385,00:13:25.554,-Ooh! -I'm sorry.
00:13:27.598,00:13:29.099,I didn't mean to say that out loud.
00:13:29.183,00:13:30.851,"I get it, Mama. She bugs."
00:13:30.935,00:13:32.603,I once worked with a guy like that.
00:13:32.686,00:13:33.938,Really irked me.
00:13:34.021,00:13:36.315,-So you know what I did? -No.
00:13:36.398,00:13:38.526,I put my butt on his car.
00:13:38.609,00:13:39.860,Excuse me?
00:13:39.944,00:13:45.950,"I went outside to the parking lot while he was working, pulled down my drawers, and plopped my nut-brown bottom on his car."
00:13:47.368,00:13:49.537,And what did that do?
00:13:51.288,00:13:52.248,Nothing.
00:13:52.331,00:13:56.252,"But now I'll always know that my butt was on his car, and he has no idea."
00:13:56.335,00:13:58.254,It's the ultimate power.
00:13:58.921,00:14:00.172,Okay.
00:14:05.261,00:14:07.304,This is all wrong.
00:14:07.388,00:14:09.682,I called. I was very clear about what we needed.
00:14:09.765,00:14:11.517,"Okay, I'm gonna go find somebody."
00:14:11.600,00:14:12.685,I can just go in here.
00:14:12.768,00:14:14.979,"No, sweetie. I'll be back in two shakes."
00:14:15.062,00:14:18.065,Let's get rid of this Mr. Rogers shit your mom picked out.
00:14:18.148,00:14:19.525,"Party shirts first, bro."
00:14:21.110,00:14:23.320,Hi. Excuse me... Dolores.
00:14:23.404,00:14:25.239,My name is Elsa Gardner.
00:14:25.322,00:14:27.992,I think I spoke to you on the phone earlier.
00:14:28.075,00:14:30.995,I remember. You told me I have a beautiful speaking voice.
00:14:31.078,00:14:33.455,You do. It's even nicer in person.
00:14:33.539,00:14:44.884,"Anyway, I was calling about my son, who, you know, he requires a special environment, specifically, a private dressing room, no music, dim lighting."
00:14:44.967,00:14:46.719,"Yes, and I said I'd see what I could do."
00:14:46.802,00:14:48.971,"-Uh-huh. -Turns out, I couldn't do anything."
00:14:50.681,00:14:52.474,Sorry. We're just in the middle.
00:14:52.558,00:14:53.893,Sorry.
00:14:53.976,00:14:58.314,"I just don't understand why you didn't say, I'm sorry, ma'am, but I can't help you."
00:14:59.273,00:15:01.150,Go spend your money elsewhere.
00:15:01.233,00:15:06.822,Preferably somewhere that is sensitive -to the needs of its diverse client base. -Mm-hmm.
00:15:07.823,00:15:09.158,I'll say that next time.
00:15:16.081,00:15:18.167,"Aw, hell yes."
00:15:18.250,00:15:20.127,"Slow clap, all the points."
00:15:21.295,00:15:23.964,"Zippers, buckles, flaps?"
00:15:24.048,00:15:25.174,I hate it.
00:15:25.257,00:15:27.384,"Trust me, leather jackets are chick magnets."
00:15:27.468,00:15:32.640,I wore one to a co-ed wedding shower and got a two-hour foot massage from the bride's cousin.
00:15:32.723,00:15:35.643,"Not the hot one, but the hot-enough one."
00:15:36.518,00:15:38.020,It doesn't feel like me.
00:15:38.103,00:15:40.731,Julia said to find clothes that feel like me.
00:15:40.814,00:15:44.276,You're trying to get girls. The last thing you want to be is yourself.
00:15:44.360,00:15:45.402,I'm taking it off.
00:15:46.070,00:15:47.571,"Trust me, Sam."
00:15:47.655,00:15:49.657,It's not like I'm asking for the moon here.
00:15:49.740,00:15:53.118,"I mean, all I'm asking is just a little consideration."
00:15:53.202,00:16:02.503,"Imagine what it's like to be on the spectrum in a place like this, with the harsh lighting, and people jostling by, you know?"
00:16:02.586,00:16:03.879,-Ma'am. -What?
00:16:03.963,00:16:06.298,-Did you just push me? -What? No!
00:16:06.382,00:16:07.716,I was demonstrating!
00:16:08.717,00:16:10.761,This is it. I found it.
00:16:10.844,00:16:12.429,Great. Now lose it again.
00:16:12.513,00:16:14.181,"That shirt is terrible, bro."
00:16:14.264,00:16:16.392,-It's not even shiny. -I love it.
00:16:16.475,00:16:19.603,"It's 100% cotton, which is my favorite percentage of cotton."
00:16:20.270,00:16:24.608,"And it has eight Antarctic whales on it, which is higher than I've seen on any other shirt."
00:16:25.275,00:16:28.779,"Fine. If you have to get the whale shirt, at least wear this over it."
00:16:31.365,00:16:33.033,"Hi, honey."
00:16:33.117,00:16:34.118,Um...
00:16:34.702,00:16:37.830,I've been banished from the store...
00:16:37.913,00:16:39.498,"basically, for being a good mom."
00:16:41.208,00:16:44.545,"You know, buy two or three things, and I'll meet you out front."
00:16:44.628,00:16:54.596,"I know what I'm getting... this wonderful whale shirt and this terrible leather jacket, which Zahid says will help me get chicas, which means girls, which was the whole reason for coming."
00:16:55.264,00:16:56.265,Wait... What?
00:16:56.348,00:16:58.017,That was the whole point of coming?
00:16:58.100,00:16:59.184,Of course.
00:17:00.477,00:17:02.062,And Julia knew about this?
00:17:02.146,00:17:03.147,It was her idea.
00:17:04.857,00:17:05.816,Uh...
00:17:22.624,00:17:24.710,"So... girls, huh?"
00:17:25.377,00:17:26.628,Where?
00:17:26.712,00:17:27.713,"No, I just mean..."
00:17:29.256,00:17:31.175,Is this something you really want?
00:17:31.258,00:17:33.010,"I mean, you want to date?"
00:17:33.677,00:17:35.971,Aren't you afraid of getting hurt?
00:17:36.055,00:17:39.808,"Well, not unless I date a great white shark."
00:17:41.393,00:17:43.145,"No, I know what you mean."
00:17:43.228,00:17:45.522,"-You mean my feelings, right? -Yeah."
00:17:47.691,00:17:52.780,"Talking to girls makes me a little nervous, but Julia says it's good to do things that scare you."
00:17:54.156,00:17:55.449,Sometimes.
00:17:58.869,00:18:00.537,"I mean, fight-or-flight, right?"
00:18:00.621,00:18:08.545,"If I'm walking down a dark alley and I start to feel afraid, that's my body trying to protect me from gang boys with knives."
00:18:10.297,00:18:15.219,"Mom, I'm getting older, and at some point, I really hope..."
00:18:16.261,00:18:17.888,that I get to see boobs.
00:18:22.768,00:18:25.062,"You know, we should get six more pillows each."
00:18:28.357,00:18:30.692,"I think we could afford that expense, right?"
00:18:37.116,00:18:38.325,I think...
00:18:40.202,00:18:42.371,Julia has too much influence over Sam.
00:18:43.580,00:18:45.332,He's getting too attached to her.
00:18:45.415,00:18:46.500,Really?
00:18:48.252,00:18:49.837,I think she's good. He likes her.
00:18:49.920,00:18:52.589,"I mean, he's doing well socially, right?"
00:18:52.673,00:18:56.135,"Yeah, but he just puts too much stock in everything she says."
00:18:56.218,00:19:00.639,"You should've seen him today. Everything was, Julia says this, Julia says that."
00:19:00.722,00:19:01.849,"Well, is that bad?"
00:19:02.391,00:19:04.143,Yes. She's pushing him.
00:19:04.226,00:19:06.812,"She's like 12, and she's pushing him and pushing him."
00:19:06.895,00:19:08.522,She's gonna push him too far.
00:19:08.605,00:19:10.232,I have to go talk to her.
00:19:11.316,00:19:12.734,"Well, just be nice."
00:19:13.402,00:19:14.778,I'm always nice.
00:19:15.529,00:19:20.033,"I'm probably not supposed to be telling you this, but Casey has some sort of boyfriend."
00:19:20.117,00:19:21.743,"Oh, yeah, I know that."
00:19:22.369,00:19:23.829,I read all her texts.
00:19:25.164,00:19:26.165,I love that.
00:19:29.918,00:19:30.919,Cool shirt.
00:19:31.545,00:19:34.173,Thanks. I'm hoping it'll get me a practice girlfriend.
00:19:34.256,00:19:36.633,I was being sarcastic. You look stupid.
00:19:36.717,00:19:38.343,"But hey, you're not hideous."
00:19:38.427,00:19:43.849,"I'm sure some sad insecure girl will crush on you someday, deep in the very far future."
00:19:43.932,00:19:44.892,I wish.
00:19:45.434,00:19:47.686,"Now, jacket or no jacket?"
00:19:47.769,00:19:50.022,"Zahid thinks jacket, but I think no jacket."
00:19:50.147,00:19:51.857,As many jackets as you can find.
00:19:56.987,00:20:02.826,"Hey, Sam, this is random, but do you know why Dad wasn't at the first Autism Awareness Walk?"
00:20:03.493,00:20:04.453,In 2004?
00:20:05.454,00:20:06.580,That's the year he left us.
00:20:07.789,00:20:09.208,"What do you mean, he left us?"
00:20:10.125,00:20:12.586,"Like, he moved out of the house?"
00:20:12.669,00:20:14.421,"Yes, for eight months."
00:20:15.339,00:20:16.506,Are you sure?
00:20:17.257,00:20:18.258,How could he do that?
00:20:19.176,00:20:22.763,I guess he packed his clothes and drove off.
00:20:56.838,00:20:58.465,"God, I hate you."
00:21:01.134,00:21:03.387,Not you. You seem fine.
00:22:12.414,00:22:15.917,I just... I can't believe that my dad would leave us.
00:22:17.169,00:22:18.712,"Like, why?"
00:22:18.795,00:22:20.547,Was he having an affair?
00:22:21.256,00:22:25.802,"Or, like, does he have, like, a whole other family somewhere else?"
00:22:26.762,00:22:28.972,"Just, it feels so unlike him."
00:22:30.140,00:22:33.435,I'm sorry that I even brought it up. I should've never said anything.
00:22:33.518,00:22:35.687,"No, I mean, I'm glad that I know."
00:22:36.897,00:22:39.066,I thought that we were so close.
00:22:39.983,00:22:42.444,"Like, who abandons their family?"
00:22:45.322,00:22:49.076,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, my dad's got a gambling problem."
00:22:49.159,00:22:51.119,"And last year, he stole my identity."
00:22:57.876,00:22:59.586,Yeah. I don't think it's that funny.
00:23:04.674,00:23:06.009,I appreciate it.
00:23:06.093,00:23:07.844,Okay. Thank you.
00:23:09.221,00:23:10.722,I know! There's no jelly in this.
00:23:10.806,00:23:13.975,"No, that was Casey's coach. She wasn't in her history class today."
00:23:14.643,00:23:18.146,She got suspended. I don't know if she's trying to get suspended again.
00:23:20.857,00:23:22.943,You think she's with the boyfriend?
00:23:24.027,00:23:25.612,I think she's with the boyfriend.
00:23:26.279,00:23:29.866,"Actually, you know what? Go to Kennedy Park. They hang out there."
00:23:29.950,00:23:32.202,-Let's go by there. -Let's kill him.
00:23:32.285,00:23:34.579,"-Take it easy, Chuck. -No, we're gonna kill him."
00:23:34.663,00:23:38.125,Chapter eight... photosynthesis. Who's excited?
00:23:49.094,00:23:51.763,"When a snake is feeling a growth spurt, it sheds."
00:24:02.065,00:24:04.317,Many of the organisms called heterotrophs...
00:24:12.325,00:24:13.493,"Uh, Sam?"
00:24:16.163,00:24:17.372,"Yes, Miss Jablonski?"
00:24:18.206,00:24:20.792,-Is everything okay? -Yes. Thank you.
00:24:20.876,00:24:22.210,Is everything okay with you?
00:24:23.545,00:24:24.671,"Yes, I'm fine."
00:24:25.463,00:24:27.174,Okay. That's good.
00:24:40.645,00:24:42.647,-Really? This is what you're doing? -What?
00:24:42.731,00:24:44.691,Skipping school after getting suspended?
00:24:44.774,00:24:47.402,-Are you gonna ask why? -Because of this asshole.
00:24:47.485,00:24:50.238,-You said he wouldn't be a distraction. -I'm not distracted by him.
00:24:50.322,00:24:52.115,-I'm distracted by you. -What?
00:24:52.782,00:24:53.950,I know that you left us.
00:24:54.701,00:24:55.702,In 2004.
00:24:56.661,00:24:57.746,For eight months.
00:24:59.581,00:25:00.790,"Oh, forget it."
00:25:04.961,00:25:06.046,Casey!
00:25:07.339,00:25:08.173,So...
00:25:09.966,00:25:11.509,You stole a tuba?
00:25:23.521,00:25:24.356,Casey.
00:25:28.985,00:25:30.028,Listen...
00:25:31.821,00:25:35.283,"I never told you about that, because, honestly, it's just..."
00:25:38.161,00:25:40.080,It's not something I'm very proud of.
00:25:42.207,00:25:43.208,Okay?
00:25:44.668,00:25:47.545,"You know, it was hard when your brother was born."
00:25:49.673,00:25:51.341,It was hard having a son who...
00:25:52.050,00:25:53.551,didn't smile and...
00:25:55.011,00:25:56.513,look you in the eye.
00:25:59.891,00:26:05.438,"And I kept thinking things would get better, and he would grow out of it, and then he was diagnosed and..."
00:26:07.649,00:26:13.738,"You know, Mom threw herself into all of it, with the support groups and the special diets, and she was great."
00:26:15.699,00:26:16.825,I just...
00:26:19.035,00:26:21.037,I just couldn't wrap my head around it.
00:26:25.834,00:26:27.002,So I left.
00:26:28.920,00:26:33.091,"Okay, and it wasn't your fault, and it wasn't Mom and Sam."
00:26:33.174,00:26:34.175,It was me.
00:26:39.055,00:26:40.307,Where'd you go?
00:26:40.390,00:26:42.100,I went to Grandpa's cabin.
00:26:42.183,00:26:43.059,And...
00:26:43.685,00:26:46.646,"first, he wanted me to build an addition to the house, and..."
00:26:47.689,00:26:49.149,and I just stayed.
00:26:50.817,00:26:52.986,I built a stupid fire pit and...
00:26:54.863,00:26:56.781,"I drank beers, and it was..."
00:26:58.825,00:26:59.701,It sucked.
00:27:02.787,00:27:04.289,I'm embarrassed that it even happened.
00:27:08.793,00:27:10.628,I can't believe that you left us.
00:27:10.712,00:27:12.797,"I know, but I'm sorry, okay?"
00:27:12.881,00:27:16.217,And you know I love you so much.
00:27:16.301,00:27:18.386,Okay? I love you more than anything.
00:27:18.470,00:27:19.596,"Yeah, I know."
00:27:20.638,00:27:21.890,I know.
00:27:21.973,00:27:23.141,I get it.
00:27:24.225,00:27:26.102,I want to leave every single day.
00:27:26.811,00:27:28.229,But you can't leave.
00:27:31.733,00:27:36.112,"Look, I just want to-- I want to make things good between the two of us."
00:27:36.196,00:27:38.281,Okay? Please? Can you tell me we're good?
00:27:39.074,00:27:39.991,Yeah.
00:27:40.575,00:27:41.618,"We're good, Dad."
00:27:44.871,00:27:47.374,I'm acting erratically. I know that.
00:27:48.124,00:27:49.584,But here's what I don't know.
00:27:49.667,00:27:53.963,I don't know who I am anymore.
00:27:57.717,00:27:58.802,Hi!
00:27:59.469,00:28:00.970,I like your shirt.
00:28:01.596,00:28:02.806,Are you being sarcastic?
00:28:02.889,00:28:04.349,"Oh, no."
00:28:05.141,00:28:14.776,-Then thank you. -Wai-- I don't know what I want.
00:28:30.834,00:28:32.502,Or what to expect.
00:29:42.280,00:29:44.866,And I'm not so good without my routines.
00:29:48.870,00:29:50.580,I'm gonna kick your butt!
00:29:57.170,00:29:58.171,Casey?
00:00:09.718,00:00:10.927,Eggs.
00:00:12.303,00:00:13.555,We need eggs.
00:00:17.058,00:00:18.184,Eggs!
00:00:25.400,00:00:30.238,"where we always treat you like family, even if you're a cheating whore."
00:00:43.460,00:00:47.547,"Register seven is now open for business, just like Elsa Gardner's vagina."
00:00:51.801,00:00:53.678,I cheated on my husband.
00:00:54.888,00:00:56.056,Okay.
00:00:57.932,00:00:59.642,Aren't you that one kid's mom?
00:01:00.351,00:01:01.436,No.
00:01:15.492,00:01:17.285,"Gonna break that record, superstar?"
00:01:17.994,00:01:19.454,Don't jinx it.
00:01:19.537,00:01:20.955,And yes.
00:01:21.039,00:01:25.001,"In nature, animals sprint at top speed when escaping a predator."
00:01:25.668,00:01:27.420,I don't know why Casey does it.
00:01:35.720,00:01:39.265,"Oh, crap. That Nelly Gutierrez from Clayton Prep is running today."
00:01:39.349,00:01:43.144,I was hoping she'd still be hurt. Young bones heal too fast.
00:01:51.111,00:01:52.987,-Who's calling you? -Luisa from group.
00:01:55.156,00:01:56.282,Oh!
00:01:56.366,00:01:57.742,Sugar. I'll be right back.
00:01:59.786,00:02:01.579,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be right back."
00:02:02.038,00:02:03.748,"Let's go, sweetie!"
00:02:04.541,00:02:05.375,"Let's go, Case!"
00:02:09.295,00:02:12.215,like a lion or a tiger or cheetah.
00:02:31.526,00:02:32.777,the mosquito.
00:02:36.030,00:02:38.491,"-Aah! What are you doing? Oh! -Sam, what are you doing?"
00:02:38.575,00:02:39.868,"Sam, let go."
00:02:39.951,00:02:42.579,"-What is happening? -Let her go! Sam, let go!"
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.126,"-Sam, it's okay. Hold on. -Whoa."
00:02:48.209,00:02:49.127,Put pressure on it.
00:02:49.210,00:02:50.753,Let's go to first aid. Sorry.
00:03:28.291,00:03:29.959,Yes!
00:03:33.588,00:03:34.672,Yes!
00:03:34.756,00:03:37.008,-You broke the record! -I'm good at my job!
00:03:37.091,00:03:39.844,"Not the teaching history part, but this-- yes!"
00:03:49.270,00:03:50.563,"Yeah, man."
00:03:58.488,00:04:00.907,How'd this happen? Weren't you paying attention?
00:04:00.990,00:04:03.743,"I was watching the race, and everything happened so fast."
00:04:03.826,00:04:05.286,And I was watching the race...
00:04:05.370,00:04:07.205,I can't believe that I hurt my own kid.
00:04:07.288,00:04:11.125,"Okay, sweetie. You couldn't have predicted he would grab that girl's ponytail."
00:04:11.209,00:04:12.043,You would have.
00:04:12.126,00:04:13.336,Probably.
00:04:13.419,00:04:15.838,"But, you know, it's my fault."
00:04:15.922,00:04:17.924,"I should have been there, and I'm really sorry."
00:04:18.007,00:04:19.592,"-Hey, guys. -Hey!"
00:04:19.676,00:04:21.803,-What did you think of the race? -Great.
00:04:21.886,00:04:25.014,You were so fast! You were like a human car.
00:04:25.098,00:04:26.683,"-Yeah, vroom. -Amazing."
00:04:26.766,00:04:29.352,"-You didn't see it. No. -No, we didn't."
00:04:29.435,00:04:31.980,-Sam had a major incident. -He cut his hand.
00:04:32.063,00:04:34.065,-He was very upset. -Honey...
00:04:34.148,00:04:37.527,"I bought these with my own money, so you can't have one. Please don't ask."
00:04:38.236,00:04:39.237,Hey!
00:04:39.779,00:04:40.613,I didn't ask.
00:04:43.324,00:04:45.285,I feel like I keep messing up with you.
00:04:45.952,00:04:47.912,It's okay. Don't worry about it.
00:04:47.996,00:04:50.498,-Sam had a thing. I get it. -Yeah. It was a bad thing.
00:04:50.581,00:04:51.582,Mm-hmm.
00:04:55.962,00:05:00.300,"So, I guess my hair did this, and he grabbed it, and I couldn't even move..."
00:05:06.222,00:05:07.473,"Hi, Sam."
00:05:10.393,00:05:13.062,I can't hear you. I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones.
00:05:13.146,00:05:14.439,"Oh, that's okay."
00:05:17.025,00:05:19.986,"You can shout all you want, but I still can't hear you."
00:05:20.069,00:05:21.404,These are top-of-the-line.
00:05:27.493,00:05:30.038,Just-- Can you take them off for just a second?
00:05:33.583,00:05:41.090,"Hi. So I saw that we had a biology test coming up, and... I don't know, I was just thinking that maybe we could study together."
00:05:41.758,00:05:43.342,Why would I want to do that?
00:05:43.426,00:05:46.512,"I'm getting an A in biology, and you're getting an A minus."
00:05:46.596,00:05:48.181,That wouldn't benefit me at all.
00:05:53.311,00:05:54.395,Okay.
00:05:58.775,00:06:06.824,"Yes, they're beautiful, but they still don't explain how a chocolate-covered strawberry ended up in our living room."
00:06:08.201,00:06:11.162,I did not! That's not a snack you forget about.
00:06:11.245,00:06:12.997,It's a fancy fruit!
00:06:13.081,00:06:15.083,"It's a sex fruit, Miles!"
00:06:15.833,00:06:19.587,"Because you obviously bought them for someone, and I want to know who."
00:06:22.215,00:06:24.467,"Thank you, again. I have to go."
00:06:24.550,00:06:26.552,But we'll discuss this matter later.
00:06:28.346,00:06:30.223,"-Hi, Sam. -Someone sent you flowers."
00:06:30.306,00:06:32.517,-Was it Miles? -Yes.
00:06:32.600,00:06:34.519,Why? Is it a special occasion?
00:06:35.228,00:06:36.771,"No, just to be nice."
00:06:37.480,00:06:41.692,"Well, if he wanted to be nice, he should've gotten you your favorite flower-- ranunculus."
00:06:41.776,00:06:43.194,"Pretty flower, bad name."
00:06:48.116,00:06:50.159,"So, how are you?"
00:06:50.243,00:06:53.246,"The last time you were here, we were talking about girls."
00:06:53.329,00:06:54.997,How's it going with dating?
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.840,-Except Paige. -Who's Paige?
00:07:03.923,00:07:10.596,"An annoying girl who's always bothering me when I'm wearing my headphones, and she wants me to study with her even though we're both getting As."
00:07:10.680,00:07:12.557,It sounds like she might like you.
00:07:13.641,00:07:14.600,Oh.
00:07:15.226,00:07:18.104,"Well, I... I guess I should make her my girlfriend then."
00:07:18.187,00:07:20.148,You just said that she was annoying.
00:07:20.231,00:07:21.232,Does that matter?
00:07:21.315,00:07:22.400,Yes.
00:07:22.483,00:07:24.610,"You need to figure out if you like her, Sam."
00:07:24.694,00:07:25.528,How?
00:07:25.611,00:07:28.906,Maybe get to know her a little better and then weigh the pros and cons.
00:07:28.990,00:07:32.034,That's what I did when I went to the pet store to get a turtle.
00:07:32.118,00:07:37.206,"There was one with larger feet, but Edison was younger with a more intricate shell pattern."
00:07:37.790,00:07:40.960,But I'll never find a girlfriend as good as Edison.
00:07:41.627,00:07:42.712,You never know.
00:07:44.130,00:07:46.174,This is gonna be good. I'm excited.
00:07:46.257,00:07:48.259,You've tried to get me back to this group for years.
00:07:48.342,00:07:49.802,I'm glad you're coming.
00:07:49.886,00:07:51.095,Me too.
00:08:02.815,00:08:04.525,-What? -Nothing.
00:08:06.569,00:08:16.454,"And I know it may seem silly to be celebrating a 15-year-old making a three-word sentence, but, honestly, it was one of the top-five moments of my life."
00:08:16.537,00:08:17.622,We had a pizza party.
00:08:17.705,00:08:19.665,"Okay, that is not silly at all."
00:08:19.749,00:08:22.043,That is a huge breakthrough.
00:08:23.294,00:08:29.717,"You know, it is so easy for those of us with higher-functioning kiddos to forget what it's like for some of our other parents."
00:08:30.551,00:08:33.804,"Doug, it's nice to see you. Do you have anything you'd like to share?"
00:08:35.223,00:08:36.933,I-- okay.
00:08:39.435,00:08:40.978,Um...
00:08:41.062,00:08:51.280,"Yeah, I'm here because I want to continue to work on my skills with our son Sam, who's one of the more higher-functioning kiddos."
00:08:56.077,00:08:58.746,we had a incident the other day...
00:08:59.622,00:09:04.293,"that was upsetting, at our daughter Casey's track meet."
00:09:04.377,00:09:10.341,"And Sam grabbed this girl's ponytail, and I honestly didn't know what to do."
00:09:10.424,00:09:12.843,-Mm-hmm. -And...
00:09:13.553,00:09:16.931,"And then this girl was screaming, and my autistic kid was..."
00:09:17.014,00:09:21.644,"Oh, Doug, so sorry. But we actually prefer to use people-first language here."
00:09:22.311,00:09:23.521,Okay.
00:09:26.148,00:09:27.984,"So, we don't say autistic kid."
00:09:28.067,00:09:32.572,"We say kid with autism, person before diagnosis."
00:09:32.655,00:09:36.659,"He doesn't know that because it's just, we don't do that at our house."
00:09:36.742,00:09:39.412,"So, it's really my bad. We probably should."
00:09:39.495,00:09:42.206,"No, it... I mean, I know it, but I just..."
00:09:42.290,00:09:44.834,"-Anyway, it doesn't matter. -No. Go, Doug."
00:09:47.962,00:09:52.425,"You know, the whole thing really threw me off because we'd been getting along well."
00:09:52.508,00:09:54.635,And he's been seeing a therapist lately.
00:09:54.719,00:09:56.846,And I felt like he was getting better.
00:09:56.929,00:10:02.351,"Oh, so sorry to interrupt you again, but, um, there is no getting better in autism."
00:10:02.435,00:10:05.855,"It's a neurological condition, not a curable disease."
00:10:05.938,00:10:07.189,"So, that's the difference."
00:10:07.273,00:10:09.400,"He didn't mean that in a negative way, Kathy."
00:10:10.067,00:10:13.779,Of course not. I just meant he's been a lot less...
00:10:15.740,00:10:18.159,"...you know, you know, aah."
00:10:18.242,00:10:27.668,What Doug means... He means that Sam is having more success using his replacement behaviors in response to environmental stimuli.
00:10:27.752,00:10:29.795,"Well, that is great news."
00:10:29.879,00:10:32.381,"Doug, would you like to add anything else?"
00:10:33.049,00:10:35.051,"No, I'm good. Thank you."
00:10:37.845,00:10:38.846,Applause for Doug.
00:10:48.230,00:10:50.107,It's really great that you came.
00:10:58.324,00:10:59.367,all willy-nilly.
00:10:59.450,00:11:03.621,"I looked up willy-nilly online, and it means reckless."
00:11:03.704,00:11:08.084,So I decided to conduct a brutal examination of Paige's pros and cons.
00:11:12.380,00:11:15.091,I'm glad you changed your mind about studying together.
00:11:15.174,00:11:20.846,"I mean, because it's very difficult to find equally academically-motivated peers these days."
00:11:20.930,00:11:22.556,I don't usually talk when I study.
00:11:22.640,00:11:23.974,Oh.
00:11:24.058,00:11:25.017,Okay.
00:11:35.694,00:11:38.322,Oh! You know what I really like to do when I'm studying?
00:11:38.406,00:11:40.074,It helps me remember things.
00:11:40.157,00:11:44.412,"I like to make things into a rap, like world history."
00:12:09.520,00:12:12.064,-Are you writing stuff about me? -Yes.
00:12:13.816,00:12:16.068,Can I-- can I see it?
00:12:16.735,00:12:17.820,No.
00:12:25.453,00:12:28.497,I have missed your little faces.
00:12:29.248,00:12:30.875,And your big face.
00:12:30.958,00:12:36.297,"So, I'm gonna make a very special family dinner with all your favorite foods."
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.215,"Doug, apple pie à la mode."
00:12:38.299,00:12:39.633,Yes! From scratch?
00:12:39.717,00:12:41.302,"Oh, yeah, from scratch."
00:12:41.385,00:12:43.220,"-Ah. -Sam, chicken fingers."
00:12:43.304,00:12:44.847,-From the box? -From the box.
00:12:45.931,00:12:47.725,"And, Casey, bacon-wrapped figs."
00:12:47.808,00:12:50.311,-I haven't eaten pork in two years. -Then figs.
00:12:50.394,00:12:52.438,Can my special dish be not coming?
00:12:52.521,00:12:55.399,Nope. They were all out of that at the market.
00:12:55.483,00:12:58.110,"It's tomorrow night, so be there or be square."
00:12:58.944,00:13:01.030,"Sam, how's your arm? Is it okay?"
00:13:01.113,00:13:03.365,"Yes, and you've asked me that six times."
00:13:03.449,00:13:05.326,It was fine then. Why would it be different now?
00:13:09.914,00:13:11.916,Stop beating up on yourself.
00:13:12.833,00:13:13.959,You know?
00:13:19.757,00:13:21.425,Jesus! What's the matter with you?
00:13:23.802,00:13:25.012,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:13:35.523,00:13:36.357,Julia.
00:13:37.024,00:13:38.734,Doug Gardner. I'm Sam's father.
00:13:38.817,00:13:40.653,"Oh! Hi, Doug!"
00:13:40.736,00:13:42.154,"-We met before. -Yeah, sorry."
00:13:42.238,00:13:44.532,-I wasn't expecting to see anyone. -That's okay.
00:13:44.615,00:13:47.826,"-This is my neighborhood hideout spot. -Oh, yeah, you live around here?"
00:13:47.910,00:13:50.371,"Yeah, I moved to the neighborhood for these cookies."
00:13:50.454,00:13:51.330,"Well, they look good."
00:13:52.289,00:13:54.250,"Well, good to see you."
00:13:54.333,00:13:56.627,"Yeah. Hey, Doug?"
00:13:56.710,00:14:02.508,"I just wanted you to know, and I don't think I'm breaking any rules here..."
00:14:02.591,00:14:05.719,you've been really helpful to Sam with dating stuff.
00:14:05.803,00:14:06.929,So...
00:14:07.012,00:14:10.182,"I don't know, just keep doing what you're doing."
00:14:10.933,00:14:12.184,"Oh, well, I'm trying."
00:14:12.268,00:14:14.436,"You know, I had a rough couple of days."
00:14:14.520,00:14:20.943,"I actually went to Elsa's support group to try to talk, but they told me that I was using the wrong words."
00:14:21.026,00:14:23.237,Let me guess. They were big on people-first language.
00:14:23.320,00:14:25.573,"Yeah, well, it doesn't make a difference, right?"
00:14:25.656,00:14:28.909,"I mean, he's still autistic. Doesn't change how he is in the world."
00:14:28.993,00:14:34.999,"And how he is in the world can make it hard sometimes, but I think it's important to celebrate the small victories."
00:14:35.082,00:14:37.793,That's a good point. I appreciate that.
00:14:38.294,00:14:40.170,"Hey, you want to sit?"
00:14:40.254,00:14:43.173,Sure. You planning on finishing that cookie?
00:14:43.257,00:14:44.383,"No, go ahead."
00:14:45.801,00:14:47.761,Thick hair like arctic fox.
00:14:47.845,00:14:49.138,Doesn't have braces.
00:14:49.221,00:14:50.890,Was once on local news.
00:14:50.973,00:14:54.226,Pronounces it 'ape-ricot.' What the hell is this?
00:14:54.310,00:14:58.355,I'm making a pros-and-cons list to figure out if I like Paige.
00:14:58.439,00:15:01.066,Oh. Let me just add one more thing.
00:15:01.150,00:15:04.403,-Hey! Why'd you do that? -There's only one list you need.
00:15:04.486,00:15:06.322,She's a girl who wants to touch your peen.
00:15:06.405,00:15:07.531,That's not a list.
00:15:07.615,00:15:13.704,"Julia said I need to figure out if I like Paige, if I'm gonna make her my practice girlfriend, so that's what I'm doing."
00:15:13.787,00:15:15.623,Fine. How well do you know her?
00:15:15.706,00:15:17.458,We mostly study in school.
00:15:17.541,00:15:20.502,Ah. That's your problem.
00:15:20.586,00:15:23.172,"You're in a sterile, controlled environment."
00:15:23.255,00:15:28.427,"You need to get her out into the world, see how she reacts to the unexpected, throw her a few curveballs."
00:15:28.510,00:15:30.346,You want me to throw balls at Paige?
00:15:32.681,00:15:34.308,You're so lucky you have me.
00:15:34.892,00:15:39.813,"I just think that you might have graded this incorrectly, because I know that I learned it right."
00:15:45.903,00:15:47.947,My mom and I have been working on that all week.
00:15:48.572,00:15:50.032,-Paige? -Yeah?
00:15:50.115,00:15:52.117,"Would you like to hang out, not in school?"
00:15:54.787,00:15:57.456,Okay. Here's my address.
00:15:57.539,00:16:08.133,"I can't drive because my natural instinct is to close my eyes, but you can take the bus to Churchill and walk six blocks, or you can take an Uber if you're over 18, per their policy I reviewed this morning."
00:16:08.217,00:16:09.176,Okay.
00:16:09.259,00:16:10.886,I need my lunch money.
00:16:14.264,00:16:15.391,I asked a girl out.
00:16:15.474,00:16:17.685,"-Oh, I'm sorry. -Why?"
00:16:17.768,00:16:18.936,I assume she said no.
00:16:19.019,00:16:21.522,"-No, she said yes. -Really?"
00:16:21.605,00:16:22.648,"Oh, I'm sorry for her."
00:16:27.861,00:16:29.738,"Coach Briggs, you wanted to see me?"
00:16:29.822,00:16:32.950,"Yes. Gardner, this is Shelby Pines."
00:16:33.033,00:16:35.452,She's the athletic director of Clayton Prep.
00:16:36.662,00:16:37.496,Hi.
00:16:37.579,00:16:40.749,I saw your impressive win on Saturday. You smoked the competition.
00:16:41.667,00:16:43.293,Do you need me to pee in a cup?
00:16:45.295,00:16:46.338,No.
00:16:46.422,00:16:49.049,"Actually, I've been keeping tabs on you for a while now."
00:16:49.133,00:16:54.138,"You're very strong in the 400, and the way you anchored that relay tipped the scales for your team."
00:16:54.221,00:16:56.849,"There were four of us. The other girls are really fast, too."
00:16:56.932,00:16:59.977,Not like you. That's why Clayton Prep would like to recruit you.
00:17:01.603,00:17:05.524,"Gardner, I think of you like a daughter..."
00:17:05.607,00:17:09.403,"much to the chagrin of my real daughter, who can't run fast at all."
00:17:10.821,00:17:13.657,I think you should at least consider this opportunity.
00:17:19.872,00:17:21.832,-They want to recruit you? -Yeah.
00:17:21.915,00:17:23.667,"-Whoa! -I know. It's crazy, right?"
00:17:23.751,00:17:26.295,-Yeah. -Clayton is the best school in the state.
00:17:26.378,00:17:32.801,"And their girls go to Division I colleges and the Olympics, and they had a girl that was in a Nike commercial. She outran a tornado."
00:17:32.885,00:17:34.178,"Oh, wow."
00:17:34.928,00:17:35.846,Yeah.
00:17:35.929,00:17:39.016,"But, I mean, really, I'm not gonna go there."
00:17:39.099,00:17:41.393,"Like, that school's all rich and fancy."
00:17:41.477,00:17:42.936,"It's, like, it's so not me."
00:17:43.020,00:17:47.107,"Well, you know, good, 'cause Clayton's like an hour away."
00:17:47.191,00:17:48.859,-We'd never see each other. -Yeah.
00:17:48.942,00:17:55.532,"And then you would miss me, and then you'd be distracted, and you'd fail all your classes, and then, you know, you'd be homeless."
00:18:01.622,00:18:04.875,"And, trust me, nobody wants that."
00:18:07.920,00:18:09.129,"You want to go, don't you?"
00:18:09.213,00:18:10.255,Shut up.
00:18:19.348,00:18:21.642,Are your parents cool with me coming to dinner?
00:18:21.725,00:18:23.560,I'm pretty sure your dad hates me.
00:18:24.394,00:18:25.854,"Yeah, they're fine with it..."
00:18:25.938,00:18:27.147,'cause they don't know.
00:18:28.857,00:18:29.942,"Damn it, Casey."
00:18:30.025,00:18:31.485,"Hey, Mrs. Gardner."
00:18:31.568,00:18:32.778,Evan.
00:18:33.403,00:18:34.279,Wow.
00:18:34.363,00:18:36.448,"-What a nice surprise. -Hey, hi. Yeah."
00:18:37.032,00:18:38.492,We have cheese.
00:18:38.575,00:18:40.285,Help yourself. And figs.
00:18:41.036,00:18:42.496,Oh. Love figs.
00:18:42.579,00:18:43.956,All kids do.
00:18:46.208,00:18:48.377,"Casey, this is a family dinner."
00:18:48.460,00:18:50.838,I've been cooking all day. This is important to me.
00:18:50.921,00:18:54.967,Only you would invite someone to a family dinner without even asking.
00:18:56.635,00:18:58.220,Sam... and friends.
00:18:58.887,00:19:00.973,-So many people! -This is awesome.
00:19:01.056,00:19:02.266,Zahid's my friend.
00:19:02.349,00:19:04.101,Paige is just a girl from school.
00:19:04.852,00:19:06.478,Come on in. You know the drill.
00:19:06.562,00:19:07.563,I certainly do.
00:19:11.817,00:19:13.610,"Well, it's very nice to meet you all."
00:19:15.279,00:19:16.947,-Evan. -Mr. Gardner.
00:19:17.030,00:19:18.031,Dad.
00:19:18.949,00:19:20.868,Why are we all saying each other's names?
00:19:20.951,00:19:24.163,"Guys, why don't you go sit on the sofa and talk amongst yourselves?"
00:19:24.246,00:19:25.789,And I'll be there in a minute.
00:19:25.873,00:19:31.086,Maybe tell an embarrassing story about yourself that nobody else knows.
00:19:31.170,00:19:36.884,"We did that as an icebreaker at Sam's camp last summer and, boy, were there some red faces."
00:19:42.514,00:19:44.391,"Ay, yai, yai. These kids are a pain in the ass."
00:19:44.474,00:19:45.475,Did we make enough food?
00:19:50.105,00:19:54.860,"Ah. I know you wanted to have a small family dinner, but the good news is Sam has two friends."
00:19:55.527,00:19:56.695,Sam has two friends.
00:19:56.778,00:19:59.114,Julia says we got to celebrate the small victories.
00:19:59.823,00:20:01.074,You talked to Julia?
00:20:02.367,00:20:04.828,No. But Sam always says that she says that.
00:20:04.912,00:20:08.624,"-Yeah, I say stuff like that, too. -I know. You say it better than her."
00:20:10.083,00:20:11.043,Come here.
00:20:18.300,00:20:20.427,"-What are you wearing? -A jacket, weirdo."
00:20:28.727,00:20:30.437,-Take it off. -Why? I'm cold.
00:20:30.520,00:20:32.147,There are a lot of people here now.
00:20:32.231,00:20:34.358,The room's gonna heat up. I know Zahid runs hot.
00:20:36.235,00:20:37.110,What?
00:20:38.946,00:20:40.364,Here's what we're gonna do.
00:20:40.948,00:20:45.994,A series of random and unsynchronized tests to determine whether Paige has what it takes to be your bae.
00:20:46.078,00:20:49.414,"I don't understand your methods, Zahid, but I trust you."
00:20:50.165,00:20:51.083,Check it.
00:20:54.628,00:20:56.171,"Hey, Paige, think fast."
00:20:57.589,00:20:58.590,I'll get it.
00:20:59.174,00:21:00.759,"Subpar reflexes, dude."
00:21:00.842,00:21:02.844,Physical prowess isn't important to me.
00:21:12.562,00:21:14.147,"My apologies, Casey."
00:21:14.231,00:21:16.149,Hi. Could I use your powder room?
00:21:16.900,00:21:19.319,"Yeah, if you stop talking like the queen of England."
00:21:19.903,00:21:22.114,The one that flushes is upstairs.
00:21:22.197,00:21:23.907,"Oh, yeah, okay."
00:23:04.466,00:23:06.593,Something weird happened at school today.
00:23:08.720,00:23:10.847,"-I don't know. -No, your, uh..."
00:23:14.518,00:23:16.812,You been... You been smoking around my daughter?
00:23:16.895,00:23:18.814,Cigarettes? No.
00:23:24.111,00:23:27.280,"What do you mean, Cigarettes? No.? You been smoking something else?"
00:23:27.364,00:23:30.242,-Dad. -I'm sure it was someone else.
00:23:30.325,00:23:32.285,"I mean, everyone at that school smokes."
00:23:32.369,00:23:34.413,It's like an episode of Mad Men.
00:23:38.041,00:23:40.127,Maybe it's a little... a little doobage?
00:23:40.210,00:23:42.170,Huh? Blunt? Kush?
00:23:42.254,00:23:46.341,"Since it's clearly, like, bothering you, why don't we just-- honey?"
00:23:47.050,00:23:48.051,"Sorry, what?"
00:23:48.135,00:23:49.427,We're just gonna take it off.
00:23:49.511,00:23:51.388,What? What the hell are you doing?
00:23:54.349,00:23:55.392,-Are you serious? -Right.
00:23:55.475,00:23:56.893,"Yeah, much better."
00:23:56.977,00:23:58.311,I like the smell of smoke.
00:23:58.395,00:24:01.690,Reminds me of my Uncle Rashid when he used to give me sips of his beer.
00:24:01.773,00:24:02.774,He's got a Corvette.
00:24:06.361,00:24:09.447,"Apparently, I kind of do that a lot."
00:24:09.531,00:24:12.868,"Some would even say it's one of my worst qualities, so..."
00:24:12.951,00:24:21.501,"So, anyway, Coach called me into his office today-- Mrs. Gardner, I was just gonna ask you to pass the iced tea, but, you know, I didn't want to sound bossy."
00:24:24.921,00:24:26.131,the hyena has the scroll.
00:24:26.882,00:24:28.884,She knows.
00:24:28.967,00:24:29.968,Is everything okay?
00:24:30.051,00:24:32.387,"Well, to be honest with you, no, it's not."
00:24:33.722,00:24:36.224,I found the pros and cons list that you made about me.
00:24:36.308,00:24:38.018,"No, he wouldn't do that, would you?"
00:24:38.101,00:24:39.477,"I would, and I did."
00:24:39.561,00:24:42.355,You wrote a burn book about the only girl that's ever liked you?
00:24:44.774,00:24:48.361,"-What are you laughing at, Cheech? -He did say you have very clean shoes."
00:24:48.445,00:24:49.988,"You've read it too, I see."
00:24:50.071,00:24:52.199,"How many people have you showed this to, Sam?"
00:24:52.282,00:24:53.450,"Oops, made it worse."
00:24:53.533,00:24:56.912,Why would you make a list about Paige?
00:24:56.995,00:24:59.831,To help me decide if I want her to be my girlfriend or not.
00:24:59.915,00:25:01.041,Girlfriend?
00:25:02.125,00:25:05.503,"Okay, I... I should probably go."
00:25:05.587,00:25:08.423,"This was a lovely dinner, though, Mr. and Mrs. Gardner."
00:25:08.506,00:25:10.592,"So, um... thank you."
00:25:13.887,00:25:15.305,-She's mad? -Yes.
00:25:15.388,00:25:16.723,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:25:33.406,00:25:34.532,You're mad.
00:25:35.909,00:25:38.036,Why would you write that mean stuff about me?
00:25:39.371,00:25:41.289,"Well, I wrote good things, too."
00:25:41.373,00:25:42.874,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:44.417,00:25:54.010,"I mean, before I read your list, I didn't know I had a nice neutral smell, but, you know, I don't even care, Sam, that you're trying to decide if you like me or whatever."
00:25:54.094,00:25:56.388,"I mean, I'm kind of trying to do that about you, too."
00:25:56.471,00:25:59.099,But you're not supposed to write that stuff down.
00:25:59.891,00:26:01.559,-Why not? -I don't know.
00:26:02.477,00:26:03.687,It's a rule.
00:26:04.354,00:26:07.190,"Well, now that I know it's a rule, I won't do it again."
00:26:07.274,00:26:10.151,And how did you read my list when it's in my back pocket?
00:26:10.235,00:26:11.486,I made an etching.
00:26:27.127,00:26:28.044,What...
00:26:28.878,00:26:29.921,Are you serious?
00:26:30.588,00:26:31.715,Resourcefulness.
00:26:32.340,00:26:33.550,That's a major pro.
00:26:33.633,00:26:35.677,You have more pros than cons.
00:26:36.970,00:26:38.388,Whoop-de-doo.
00:26:42.934,00:26:47.605,"Paige... I know I made you mad, but do you want to be my girlfriend?"
00:26:54.988,00:26:55.947,Yes.
00:26:56.614,00:26:58.074,We've never met this girl.
00:26:58.158,00:27:00.577,I never even heard her name before-- Paige?
00:27:00.660,00:27:02.495,-I have a little news. -Big news.
00:27:02.579,00:27:06.750,"I mean, I knew he was interested in girls, but this is, you know, awfully fast."
00:27:06.833,00:27:08.626,I'm being recruited.
00:27:08.710,00:27:09.711,By Clayton Prep.
00:27:09.794,00:27:13.798,"Yeah, I guess they saw my last race, and I don't know, they want me."
00:27:13.882,00:27:15.550,Wow! Clayton?
00:27:15.633,00:27:17.510,-Mm-hmm. -That's huge.
00:27:26.394,00:27:28.813,"No, they want me to start right away."
00:27:28.897,00:27:30.023,What do you guys think?
00:27:30.106,00:27:31.983,Wow. That's exciting.
00:27:36.112,00:27:38.531,"-There's a lot to discuss. -Yeah, for sure."
00:27:38.615,00:27:40.241,We have to figure it out.
00:27:40.325,00:27:47.457,"I mean, you know, I'm sorry, honey, but I don't think there's any way that this could work."
00:27:47.540,00:27:51.378,"I mean, we need you at the same school as Sam, right?"
00:27:51.461,00:27:54.005,But we'll talk about it when your friends aren't here.
00:27:54.089,00:27:56.841,'Cause he doesn't have a one-to-one aide anymore.
00:27:56.925,00:27:58.468,And he relies on you heavily.
00:27:58.551,00:28:00.136,"So, I'm..."
00:28:00.804,00:28:03.681,-I don't know how it could happen. -Yeah.
00:28:05.517,00:28:06.726,-Okay. -Okay. Yeah.
00:28:13.066,00:28:14.192,Where are you from?
00:28:14.275,00:28:17.070,Vermont. We moved here when I was in the sixth grade.
00:28:17.153,00:28:19.739,But we still head back every fall to peep them leaves.
00:28:19.823,00:28:21.157,"I'm sorry, but, um..."
00:28:21.241,00:28:22.659,"Whoa, why is he standing up?"
00:28:22.742,00:28:24.869,-Where are you going? -You have two kids.
00:28:24.953,00:28:25.870,"Evan, don't."
00:28:25.954,00:28:28.581,"No, but you act like you have one. And I get it."
00:28:32.293,00:28:33.795,But Casey broke a record.
00:28:33.878,00:28:36.589,"She did something cool, and you guys didn't even see it."
00:28:36.673,00:28:37.841,"I mean, where were you?"
00:28:38.633,00:28:41.594,Now she's got a chance to go to a fancy-ass school!
00:28:41.678,00:28:43.471,Sorry for my language.
00:28:43.555,00:28:48.893,"But, I mean, I don't want her to go three towns away, either, but at least I get that she's..."
00:28:49.811,00:28:51.563,she's too good for this place.
00:28:52.230,00:28:53.064,So...
00:28:54.774,00:28:56.609,that's all.
00:28:56.693,00:28:57.986,Um...
00:29:00.280,00:29:02.699,The roast was really good.
00:29:07.454,00:29:09.289,"Mom, it's okay."
00:29:11.291,00:29:12.667,I have a girlfriend.
00:29:15.211,00:29:18.923,"Nice. She's wound a little tight, but I like her style."
00:29:25.638,00:29:27.557,"Dessert. I, um..."
00:29:27.640,00:29:29.601,I need to buy ice cream.
00:29:29.684,00:29:33.271,Um... I forgot. I'm just gonna go to the store.
00:29:33.354,00:29:37.108,"I made apple pie à la mode, and I forgot the ice cream, which is the mode."
00:29:37.192,00:29:39.861,Don't anybody leave. I'll be back in seven minutes.
00:29:42.238,00:29:43.740,I'm lactose-intolerant.
00:29:43.823,00:29:46.785,"Yeah. You got a lot of things going on, don't you, sweetie?"
00:30:04.594,00:30:07.096,Hey. I need to talk to you about something.
00:30:07.180,00:30:09.891,"-Okay. -Can you cover your arms, please?"
00:30:10.600,00:30:11.559,Never mind.
00:30:12.352,00:30:14.270,"What we did, it was nice."
00:30:14.354,00:30:16.523,-I agree. -But it's done.
00:30:16.606,00:30:18.733,I have a life. I have a family.
00:30:18.817,00:30:23.738,"And I can't do for them what I need to do with you in my head, all right?"
00:30:23.822,00:30:28.576,"And what are you doing, having sex with a married woman anyway, you know?"
00:30:28.660,00:30:30.995,You're bad. You are a bad person.
00:30:31.079,00:30:34.123,"You know, being all sexy and cute with me-- bad!"
00:30:34.207,00:30:36.334,So we're done.
00:30:37.043,00:30:38.962,All right? Goodbye.
00:30:40.797,00:30:41.840,And...
00:30:43.049,00:30:45.009,do you have any vanilla ice cream?
00:30:45.093,00:30:48.680,"I can't go to the Valley Marketplace, and that's your fault, too."
00:30:49.806,00:30:50.890,Ice cream?
00:30:58.857,00:31:00.859,"So, yeah, turns out she wasn't a bot."
00:31:00.942,00:31:04.487,She was my cousin Tushar. Small world.
00:31:04.571,00:31:05.947,I haven't talked to him since.
00:31:06.030,00:31:09.659,"Listen, Mom and I will talk about Clayton Prep, so don't worry about it."
00:31:09.742,00:31:11.744,"-Really? -Yes, I promise."
00:31:11.828,00:31:12.996,Mm.
00:31:13.079,00:31:15.623,"And your stoner boyfriend, he's starting to grow on me."
00:31:15.707,00:31:21.045,"But just remember if the situation ever calls for it, I'll body slam that little shit. You know that, right?"
00:31:21.129,00:31:22.088,-Yeah. Yeah. -Okay.
00:31:23.423,00:31:24.257,Okay.
00:31:25.508,00:31:27.343,Who wants dessert?
00:00:12.387,00:00:14.347,I learned everything about it...
00:00:14.431,00:00:22.897,"the products they sell, the rules and procedures for employees, how not to tell customers they smell bad even if they do."
00:00:23.189,00:00:28.778,"And I had a sit-down with Bob, the manager, who has hairy knuckles, but is nice."
00:00:28.862,00:00:29.904,Sam?
00:00:32.991,00:00:34.034,Is everything okay?
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.368,"Yes, I'm fine, thank you."
00:00:35.452,00:00:37.912,"I had curly fries for lunch, and I have a girlfriend now."
00:00:42.000,00:00:44.252,Congratulations. Tell me about her.
00:00:44.335,00:00:46.880,"-You know, what's the lucky lady's name? -Which one?"
00:00:46.963,00:00:48.047,Your girlfriend.
00:00:48.923,00:00:51.885,"Oh. Her name is Paige, and she has blonde hair."
00:00:51.968,00:00:54.179,She's bossy and touches all of my stuff.
00:00:54.262,00:00:59.809,"She was born in New Jersey in the same town as Queen Latifah, and she's coming over today after work."
00:01:02.729,00:01:04.647,"Oh, yeah. I get it."
00:01:05.857,00:01:07.442,"I have a wife, so..."
00:01:09.861,00:01:11.571,You take all the time you need.
00:01:16.076,00:01:18.912,but that's just a smart survival instinct.
00:01:19.704,00:01:27.253,"Do you think that a bearded seal would last very long if it said, Well, I've never seen that animal before with the sharp teeth and beautiful white fur."
00:01:27.337,00:01:28.838,I'll walk over and meet him.
00:01:29.923,00:01:31.090,No.
00:01:31.174,00:01:34.636,"No, he wouldn't, because that's how you become a polar bear's dinner."
00:01:54.364,00:01:56.783,-You nervous about tomorrow? -No.
00:01:56.866,00:01:58.535,"Oh, you're, like, freaking out."
00:01:58.618,00:01:59.911,Kind of.
00:01:59.994,00:02:03.581,"Well, hey, just remember they recruited you."
00:02:03.665,00:02:07.377,"So just, you know, keep your pants on and don't curse so much. You'll be fine."
00:02:07.460,00:02:09.879,"I have to keep my pants on at the interview, really?"
00:02:09.963,00:02:12.006,"Yeah, call me old fashioned, but..."
00:02:12.090,00:02:15.802,"I know that the athletic department wants me, but I still have the interview."
00:02:15.885,00:02:19.180,And then I need to prove that I'm not just a dum-dum who can run fast.
00:02:19.264,00:02:22.725,"Hey, you're not just a dum-dum that can run fast. You're also very hot."
00:02:26.980,00:02:28.398,It feels like a big deal.
00:02:29.691,00:02:31.860,"Yeah, well, I mean, it is a big deal. It is."
00:02:31.943,00:02:33.528,"Be nervous, that's okay."
00:02:34.988,00:02:36.197,You'll be fine.
00:02:49.836,00:02:52.463,Jesus! It's like she has a nanny cam in here.
00:03:06.686,00:03:07.562,"No, no, no."
00:03:19.157,00:03:21.659,-Are you insane? -Where are you calling from?
00:03:21.743,00:03:24.871,-I can barely hear you. -The laundry room. I'm running the dryer.
00:03:26.122,00:03:31.836,"Listen, the last time we spoke, I made it very, very clear that we are done."
00:03:31.920,00:03:34.380,Why are you doing inviting me to your birthday party?
00:03:37.091,00:03:40.345,"Yeah, um, sorry about that. You weren't supposed to get that."
00:03:41.387,00:03:42.347,I wasn't?
00:03:42.430,00:03:45.350,"No, I accidentally sent that out to my entire address book."
00:03:45.433,00:03:47.560,My dry cleaner just RSVPed.
00:03:48.436,00:03:50.772,"I, uh, might have been a bit stoned when I sent it."
00:03:51.481,00:03:53.274,I just got it two minutes ago.
00:03:53.358,00:03:55.401,"Yeah, I might be a little bit stoned now."
00:03:56.069,00:03:58.780,"Okay. Great, I'm gonna hang up now."
00:03:59.572,00:04:01.407,"Um, Nick?"
00:04:01.491,00:04:02.408,Mm-hmm.
00:04:02.492,00:04:04.077,"Um, I'm sorry..."
00:04:05.119,00:04:06.204,about the other night.
00:04:06.287,00:04:09.082,I shouldn't have called you a terrible person.
00:04:09.165,00:04:12.168,Yeah. You hurt my feelings. Come over and apologize.
00:04:12.252,00:04:13.461,Shut up.
00:04:13.544,00:04:17.382,I'm saying I shouldn't have blamed you for what happened between us.
00:04:17.465,00:04:18.549,"It was my fault, too."
00:04:18.633,00:04:25.390,"It's just made me realize how precious and fragile my family is, you know?"
00:04:25.473,00:04:30.520,"It's like a wake-up call, because since then, I feel like I've been more present and kind."
00:04:30.603,00:04:34.440,"Hey, you know what? I'm actually at work right now, so I can't talk, but uh..."
00:04:34.524,00:04:36.526,-See you at my birthday party? -What?
00:04:37.527,00:04:40.071,"-Elsa, I'm kidding. -Okay, goodbye."
00:04:50.540,00:04:52.500,This isn't me. I'm better than this.
00:04:53.710,00:04:56.296,"I'm not a snooping, paranoid girlfriend."
00:04:56.379,00:04:59.257,"But I'm, like, 90% sure he's hiding something from me."
00:04:59.340,00:05:02.343,I spent all night Googling those car tracker thingys from Breaking Bad.
00:05:02.427,00:05:04.846,All of this for a strawberry.
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.809,That's a sexually charged fruit.
00:05:09.892,00:05:11.185,He's cheating on me.
00:05:11.269,00:05:17.900,"As someone with a PhD in clinical psychology, my formal diagnosis for you is you're cray."
00:05:17.984,00:05:18.860,I am not!
00:05:18.943,00:05:22.530,"If you guys were in a good place, this strawberry would be something you'd laugh off."
00:05:22.613,00:05:29.704,"But it's been five years, he still hasn't proposed, and it's making you, well, cray."
00:05:29.787,00:05:32.040,"No, this isn't about him proposing."
00:05:32.123,00:05:34.375,This is about that damn strawberry.
00:05:34.459,00:05:36.711,Fine. Your worst fears are confirmed.
00:05:36.794,00:05:40.923,"He bought those strawberries for some other girl, and they're getting married."
00:05:41.007,00:05:42.759,You should probably live in a ditch.
00:05:43.426,00:05:45.595,Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear.
00:05:47.096,00:05:47.930,Okay.
00:05:53.144,00:05:54.103,"Hey, you two."
00:05:54.187,00:05:56.272,"Paige, I didn't expect to see you today."
00:05:56.355,00:06:02.653,"She waited for me at the bus stop, and she made me carry her Thermos, which is nickel-plated, so it was very cold. She talked the whole way."
00:06:08.576,00:06:10.203,"Well, that's what couples do."
00:06:11.370,00:06:14.665,Couples. That's what couples do. Sounds very official.
00:06:15.374,00:06:18.294,"Oh. Well, actually, I brought a snack."
00:06:18.377,00:06:22.298,"But it's that dense, chewy kind, that maybe you can't eat the whole thing."
00:06:22.381,00:06:23.925,"So, do you want to go halfsies?"
00:06:24.008,00:06:27.303,We could be like Arctic foxes sharing food with our den mates.
00:06:28.638,00:06:29.680,Card.
00:06:34.477,00:06:38.189,It's a system I developed so Sam doesn't annoy people with Antarctica facts.
00:06:38.272,00:06:43.152,"I give him three cards at the beginning of every day, and when he talks about Antarctica, I take one away."
00:06:43.236,00:06:46.864,"When he's out of cards, he can't talk about it anymore. Right, Sam?"
00:06:46.948,00:06:48.950,I decorated it with puffy paint.
00:06:49.992,00:06:51.577,"Sam, are you okay with this?"
00:06:51.661,00:06:55.206,"I think it's dumb, but other people seem to be happy, mostly Paige."
00:07:00.086,00:07:02.797,Arctic foxes tend to form monogamous pairs...
00:07:02.880,00:07:08.469,and their litters can contain as many as 25 kits.
00:07:08.553,00:07:09.846,Twenty-five!
00:07:10.346,00:07:11.347,Wow!
00:07:11.431,00:07:14.517,I'm actually not surprised that it's a little bit messy in here.
00:07:14.600,00:07:20.022,"I've been doing research, and while some think that people on the spectrum are always neat, sometimes they're not."
00:07:23.943,00:07:26.154,"Portland, Oregon. I have a second cousin there."
00:07:28.114,00:07:29.240,"Spin. Ooh, a compass."
00:07:34.829,00:07:36.622,What kind of batteries does this take?
00:07:36.706,00:07:39.500,"Ooh, helicopters. I like to call these choppers."
00:07:39.584,00:07:41.127,What's this cool sculpture?
00:07:41.210,00:07:43.504,Is it a sculpture? How many of these would fit in...
00:07:43.588,00:07:45.923,It could be a hat! Should we see? So many books.
00:07:46.007,00:07:48.676,You can store trinkets in here. I use a highlighter for...
00:07:48.759,00:07:52.722,"This would look better by your bed. Ooh, what's this blue thing?"
00:07:52.805,00:07:54.640,Your pencils... Right here.
00:07:56.601,00:07:58.060,Oh!
00:07:58.853,00:08:00.938,Look at this little guy.
00:08:01.522,00:08:02.899,Somebody wants to snuggle.
00:08:02.982,00:08:04.901,No! Do not snuggle Edison.
00:08:06.319,00:08:08.321,"Hey, buddy!"
00:08:13.409,00:08:14.744,"Hey, Sam, what's going on?"
00:08:18.498,00:08:21.209,-Is there a lady in your closet? -Yes. Paige.
00:08:21.292,00:08:24.003,"She was touching all of my stuff, so I locked her in there."
00:08:26.631,00:08:30.134,"No. Sam, move. You don't lock girls in your closet."
00:08:30.218,00:08:31.761,"Paige, I'm sorry. Are you okay?"
00:08:31.844,00:08:33.012,"Oh, yeah, I'm fine."
00:08:33.095,00:08:34.138,-Are you sure? -Yeah.
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.891,"Sam, apologize to Paige right now, okay? Say you're sorry."
00:08:36.974,00:08:38.684,But I'm not. I did what I needed to do.
00:08:38.768,00:08:40.645,-Sam! -It's okay.
00:08:40.728,00:08:44.690,I know from my research that sometimes people with ASD have outsized reactions to stuff.
00:08:45.274,00:08:47.735,"I mean, let's be honest, I know that..."
00:08:47.818,00:08:50.029,"I can be a handful, even for neurotypicals."
00:08:50.112,00:08:53.324,"So, I figured I'd give Sam a break to recharge his batteries."
00:08:53.407,00:08:55.660,It was only ten minutes. That's nothing.
00:08:55.743,00:09:00.957,Researchers at Antarctica's Halley VI Station live in 24-hour darkness for months.
00:09:01.040,00:09:02.083,Last one.
00:09:02.166,00:09:03.000,Card.
00:09:07.797,00:09:09.423,I should probably get home.
00:09:09.507,00:09:13.219,"Oh, and Sam, I refolded all of your socks in a totally better way. Bye."
00:09:15.388,00:09:16.597,"Bye, Paige."
00:09:22.228,00:09:25.022,"Hey, Dad, did Mom used to touch all of your stuff?"
00:09:25.106,00:09:26.566,How did you get her to stop?
00:09:27.817,00:09:29.151,Um...
00:09:30.194,00:09:31.904,I don't think I ever did.
00:09:32.863,00:09:33.698,Hmm.
00:09:41.330,00:09:44.000,"Oh, my gosh. Look at you."
00:09:44.083,00:09:45.835,You look so pretty.
00:09:47.169,00:09:49.839,-Maybe different shoes. -Mom.
00:09:51.424,00:09:58.264,"Honey, I want you to know that I am fully on board for you to attend Clayton Prep."
00:09:58.848,00:10:04.395,"Oh, yeah? Does this have anything to do with the five-hour conversation that you and Dad had the other day?"
00:10:04.478,00:10:06.731,"It took me some time, but I got there."
00:10:07.440,00:10:11.527,"And the distance and the money and Sam, we'll figure it out."
00:10:11.611,00:10:13.863,"Oh, that reminds me. Sam?"
00:10:16.616,00:10:20.328,"We have the Clayton tour, so I won't be in school to give you your lunch money."
00:10:20.411,00:10:24.373,But Evan's sister Beth will hold onto it and find you during fifth period.
00:10:24.457,00:10:25.750,Do you know who Beth is?
00:10:26.459,00:10:29.170,"Yes, she talks loud. Why are you wearing a dress?"
00:10:29.253,00:10:33.049,Do they need to see how muscly your legs are to know if they want you on the team?
00:10:33.132,00:10:36.927,Let's go. You don't want to be late before you actually go to the school.
00:10:37.011,00:10:39.347,Look. You're wearing the Clayton colors.
00:10:39.430,00:10:42.058,That is not on purpose. You wear that shirt every day.
00:10:42.141,00:10:43.768,"Still, he looks very nice."
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.022,We're a beautiful family.
00:10:51.275,00:10:52.109,Hey.
00:11:02.536,00:11:03.871,Why is she being so nice?
00:11:03.954,00:11:06.165,"I don't know, but don't jinx it. You look good."
00:11:06.248,00:11:07.750,-Let's go. -Thanks.
00:11:25.393,00:11:26.894,It's so beautiful here.
00:11:26.977,00:11:28.646,Very nice. It's very fancy.
00:11:33.109,00:11:35.778,"Yeah, they even had real towels in the girls' bathroom."
00:11:35.861,00:11:37.613,This place is classy.
00:11:37.696,00:11:40.491,-We're classy. -Middle classy.
00:11:40.574,00:11:43.327,"Honey, you've always been so mature and sophisticated."
00:11:43.411,00:11:44.745,You'll fit right in here.
00:11:44.829,00:11:47.164,"Mom, I punched a girl in the face two weeks ago."
00:11:47.248,00:11:49.166,"Honey, they don't know that, okay?"
00:11:49.250,00:11:50.709,Look. Look at that girl.
00:11:50.793,00:11:55.381,"In her little uniform, marching towards her future with that big backpack."
00:11:55.464,00:11:56.924,That's gonna be you next year.
00:11:57.675,00:11:59.176,Fresh start.
00:12:10.438,00:12:11.480,"Hi, Sam."
00:12:13.399,00:12:16.736,That's my sweatshirt. You're wearing my sweatshirt.
00:12:16.819,00:12:19.655,"When I was locked in your closet, I got cold, so I put it on."
00:12:19.738,00:12:22.533,But it was so cute and cozy that I decided to steal it.
00:12:22.616,00:12:24.827,I love it. It's like you're hugging me all day.
00:12:25.411,00:12:26.871,But that's my sweatshirt.
00:12:28.622,00:12:30.458,-Do you want to hear it? -Sweatshirt.
00:12:30.541,00:12:34.545,"You could drop your study hall and take French with me. Sam, it would be so fun."
00:12:34.628,00:12:37.173,And it's the most romantic language in the world.
00:12:37.256,00:12:44.472,"And who knows? Maybe one day, we could travel to Paris and kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower or something."
00:12:44.555,00:12:45.639,That's my sweatshirt.
00:12:48.267,00:12:50.603,when faced with a new dangerous situation.
00:12:50.686,00:12:51.562,They can run...
00:12:52.897,00:12:54.023,they can attack...
00:13:12.625,00:13:13.918,Casey.
00:13:14.001,00:13:15.711,I'm Jayson. Nice to meet you.
00:13:15.794,00:13:18.214,"Hey. You, too. You look familiar."
00:13:18.297,00:13:20.299,"I'm black, so they put me on the brochures."
00:13:20.382,00:13:22.801,"-Oh, yeah, that's it. -Come on."
00:13:22.885,00:13:23.719,Okay.
00:13:25.054,00:13:27.306,So we do peer interviews here.
00:13:27.389,00:13:33.020,"It's supposed to make you feel more comfortable, and I must be crushing it because you seem comfortable, so..."
00:13:33.103,00:13:34.855,"Oh, um..."
00:13:34.939,00:13:38.400,I'm-- I swear I'm just like a little-- completely nervous.
00:13:38.859,00:13:41.320,It's just my other school is not this nice.
00:13:42.029,00:13:44.990,You guys don't have a yoga room or bio-sustainable duck pond?
00:13:45.074,00:13:46.951,"No. No, we don't."
00:13:47.326,00:13:49.411,"Look, I get it."
00:13:49.495,00:13:52.331,But this place is pretty cool once you get used to it.
00:13:57.711,00:13:59.088,You gonna turn that off or...
00:14:00.548,00:14:01.757,Um...
00:14:01.840,00:14:03.175,"Hey, Beth, what's going on?"
00:14:03.259,00:14:06.345,"I know I was supposed to give Sam his lunch money, but I can't find him."
00:14:06.428,00:14:08.931,"-I don't know where he is. -Okay, calm down. Um..."
00:14:09.014,00:14:12.226,"-What about Paige, did you ask her? -Yeah. She hasn't seen him."
00:14:12.309,00:14:15.479,"Now he'll miss lunch, the second-most important meal of the day."
00:14:15.563,00:14:17.439,Okay. That's okay. I'm gonna text him.
00:14:17.523,00:14:18.857,"Thank you for trying, Beth."
00:14:24.446,00:14:27.324,-Are you trying to blow this? -My brother's autistic.
00:14:30.077,00:14:31.495,"Well, I'm a dick."
00:14:31.579,00:14:33.247,"No, that's okay. You didn't know."
00:14:33.330,00:14:38.627,"I just have to answer my phone in case he's freaking out or he disappeared, which is what happened right now."
00:14:38.711,00:14:40.337,It's kind of my job as his sister.
00:14:40.921,00:14:42.798,That must be hard for you.
00:14:45.551,00:14:49.471,Okay. Found him. He is hiding from his girlfriend in the science lab.
00:14:52.016,00:14:53.601,Okay. Seems like we're all good.
00:14:53.684,00:14:54.727,Wow.
00:14:55.060,00:14:56.729,"Okay, so..."
00:14:57.771,00:14:59.732,you said that it has its moments.
00:14:59.815,00:15:01.025,Mm-hmm.
00:15:01.108,00:15:02.234,Tell me about 'em.
00:15:03.485,00:15:04.612,Okay.
00:15:05.946,00:15:07.031,Well...
00:15:09.658,00:15:16.707,"So when I was growing up, my mom and brother used to refer to people who weren't on the spectrum as neurotypicals..."
00:15:16.790,00:15:18.500,NTs for short.
00:15:19.251,00:15:24.798,"But when I was little, I always thought that they were saying empties, which made sense because..."
00:15:26.133,00:15:33.474,sometimes it feels like Sam takes up so much space that everybody around him needs to be empty.
00:15:38.270,00:15:40.105,"Sorry, I don't know why I told you that."
00:15:40.856,00:15:44.944,"If you were to come here, what's it going to be like to leave your brother?"
00:15:47.154,00:15:49.949,I don't know. I never did it before.
00:15:52.868,00:15:56.789,"I don't want her to be cold, I want her to be a comfortable temperature."
00:15:56.872,00:15:59.708,"But it's my sweatshirt, and I need it."
00:15:59.792,00:16:05.089,"Wh-- when I'm anxious, especially, or overwhelmed, because that's why I have it in the first place."
00:16:11.095,00:16:14.515,"Are you just gonna sit there staring, because it's super weird."
00:16:16.100,00:16:18.310,Sam's got a real problem with his girlfriend.
00:16:18.394,00:16:20.729,-Practice girlfriend. -See? It's weird.
00:16:20.813,00:16:21.855,You're weird.
00:16:21.939,00:16:23.816,Everybody's weird.
00:16:23.899,00:16:25.317,It's awesome.
00:16:25.401,00:16:27.528,"Come on, Kayla, you're great at this stuff."
00:16:27.611,00:16:30.155,Help my boy out so we can get back to the cha-cha. Arr.
00:16:30.948,00:16:31.991,Fine.
00:16:32.074,00:16:37.955,"Look, I don't know this chick, but girls like to wear something that reminds them of their boyfriend when he's not around."
00:16:40.833,00:16:43.711,"I don't know, maybe give her something else to replace it."
00:16:46.088,00:16:48.757,"-That's extremely wise. -I told you, dude."
00:16:48.841,00:16:50.092,Kayla's a total genius.
00:16:50.175,00:16:51.552,"Plus, she works at Claire's."
00:16:51.635,00:16:55.222,"She can pierce whatever you want for half price, except scrotes."
00:16:55.305,00:16:58.434,"I don't want her handling some other dude's dangle-downs, know what I'm saying?"
00:17:00.352,00:17:01.311,No.
00:17:02.021,00:17:04.273,"Oh, my goodness, that was fun."
00:17:05.107,00:17:09.695,"Casey, you need to write that nice boy that interviewed you a thank you e-mail."
00:17:09.778,00:17:11.405,"No, that is super nerdy."
00:17:11.488,00:17:14.199,"Yeah, well, nerdy's good. Nerds get full scholarships."
00:17:14.283,00:17:15.826,"You want to go there, right?"
00:17:19.621,00:17:20.456,Whatever.
00:17:21.790,00:17:24.084,Hey. I had fun with you today.
00:17:31.091,00:17:36.764,"Oh, it's Chuck. Him and Donna are gonna be in the neighborhood and want a dinner recommendation. Know any good places?"
00:17:36.847,00:17:38.849,Mm-hmm. Here.
00:17:38.932,00:17:39.975,"-What, to eat? -Yeah."
00:17:40.059,00:17:42.061,I'm making carnitas. We can have a fiesta.
00:17:42.144,00:17:44.438,But we never have people over on a school night.
00:17:44.521,00:17:47.274,-We never have people over anyway. -Let's do it.
00:17:47.357,00:17:52.237,"Let's be those people that have friends over on a school night, -on a Tuesday. -Let's get crazy."
00:17:52.321,00:17:54.198,"-Yeah. -Yeah, what's going on with you?"
00:17:58.285,00:17:59.870,What's going on with your phone?
00:18:01.455,00:18:03.540,"You know what, it's the autism support group."
00:18:03.624,00:18:05.751,-I-I gotta call Luisa. -Okay.
00:18:09.171,00:18:10.422,It's Nick. Leave a message.
00:18:11.423,00:18:12.841,Hi. It's Elsa.
00:18:12.925,00:18:19.473,"Listen, I am calling because every time someone RSVPs to your party, I get an e-mail."
00:18:19.556,00:18:28.190,"And while I am thrilled to know that you have a friend named Meatball who will be bringing special brownies, I don't need to hear about it."
00:18:28.273,00:18:30.359,And what are you doing having a birthday party?
00:18:30.442,00:18:32.027,You're a grown man.
00:18:36.532,00:18:40.244,"You don't sing, you don't split the bill, and you call it a day. Okay?"
00:18:40.327,00:18:41.495,Goodbye.
00:18:47.584,00:18:48.502,"Hey, Casey."
00:18:49.670,00:18:52.714,"Uh, could we talk for a second? It's about your brother Sam."
00:18:58.762,00:19:05.352,"It's just I think maybe he's avoiding me because we were talking yesterday, and..."
00:19:06.103,00:19:10.357,"I don't know, maybe I upset him, because he sort of just disappeared after that."
00:19:12.151,00:19:14.069,"I don't know, maybe it's nothing."
00:19:14.653,00:19:17.573,"It's not nothing, because of you, he didn't eat lunch yesterday."
00:19:18.907,00:19:25.247,"Which I know is an annoying thing to have to think about when you're dating an 18-year-old dude, but that's what you get with Sam."
00:19:26.707,00:19:27.749,Um...
00:19:28.500,00:19:29.543,Okay.
00:19:30.085,00:19:31.378,Do you have any advice?
00:19:32.963,00:19:34.923,Yeah. Stop seeing my brother.
00:19:36.967,00:19:39.595,Why are you with him? What's in it for you?
00:19:40.220,00:19:44.516,"Are you desperate, or do you think you'll get extra credit for dating the weird kid?"
00:19:45.100,00:19:46.226,No.
00:19:47.394,00:19:50.230,"No, Casey, I-- I really like Sam."
00:19:50.314,00:19:52.107,-Mm. -A lot.
00:19:52.941,00:19:55.194,He's honest.
00:19:55.277,00:19:57.571,And he's so cute.
00:19:57.654,00:20:00.365,And have you seen his notebook thing?
00:20:00.449,00:20:01.408,It's amazing.
00:20:01.491,00:20:04.036,The way his brain works is so interesting.
00:20:04.119,00:20:07.039,Interesting? My brother's not a science experiment.
00:20:07.706,00:20:08.790,"No, I know that."
00:20:08.874,00:20:11.418,"What happens when he relies on you, then you leave?"
00:20:11.501,00:20:13.837,-I'm not gonna... -'Cause then he'll need you.
00:20:14.588,00:20:16.423,And that shit can really mess him up.
00:20:18.800,00:20:21.303,"You know, you don't understand any of this."
00:20:22.179,00:20:24.014,You're just making everything worse.
00:21:13.897,00:21:15.774,Paige returned my favorite sweatshirt.
00:21:15.857,00:21:17.818,That's nice. When did that happen?
00:21:17.901,00:21:19.236,When she broke up with me.
00:21:19.903,00:21:20.737,Oh.
00:21:21.363,00:21:23.699,"Sorry, Sam. Did she say why?"
00:21:24.199,00:21:25.200,Something about...
00:21:26.451,00:21:29.621,"Casey was afraid she was gonna hurt me, or she was afraid of Casey."
00:21:29.705,00:21:34.126,"I don't know. Sometimes when she talks, she uses so many words that I get a little lost."
00:21:34.710,00:21:35.919,How are you feeling?
00:21:36.503,00:21:37.629,Fine.
00:21:37.713,00:21:39.548,Got my sweatshirt back.
00:21:40.716,00:21:43.135,Are you sure you're fine?
00:21:46.221,00:21:48.640,Most people I meet don't even try to get me.
00:21:49.349,00:21:51.351,"Paige tried, and that was nice."
00:21:52.978,00:21:54.062,That is nice.
00:21:55.480,00:21:58.608,"The whole time she was my girlfriend, she bugged me."
00:21:58.692,00:22:04.489,But I think I was so focused on how annoying she is that I kind of forgot about the good parts.
00:22:05.490,00:22:06.742,That's a...
00:22:07.659,00:22:09.494,"great perspective, Sam."
00:22:10.245,00:22:11.538,Wise beyond your years.
00:22:13.874,00:22:16.293,She didn't even mind when I locked her in my closet.
00:22:16.877,00:22:18.795,That seems special and rare.
00:22:19.504,00:22:20.881,"Wait, what?"
00:22:31.433,00:22:32.601,"Hey, it's me."
00:22:32.684,00:22:36.271,"I'm coming home, and we should talk."
00:22:36.897,00:22:38.106,I love you.
00:22:42.819,00:22:44.112,"Apparently, I like Paige."
00:22:44.196,00:22:46.073,"Apparently, I like it when you knock."
00:22:46.156,00:22:49.242,And now she's not my girlfriend because of you. You drove her away.
00:22:49.326,00:22:51.745,"Okay, well, all you do is complain about her."
00:22:52.329,00:22:55.165,"-And I get it; she's super-annoying. -Well, I like her, I think."
00:22:55.290,00:22:58.835,"And you're my little sister, and I don't need you messing with my life."
00:22:58.919,00:23:01.046,"Oh, my God! I was just trying to help."
00:23:01.421,00:23:03.423,I'm not always gonna be around to stick up for you.
00:23:03.507,00:23:05.133,-Good. -Sam...
00:23:05.217,00:23:07.636,"No, you're just like Paige."
00:23:07.719,00:23:15.977,"But instead of touching my books and my turtle, you're touching my girlfriend. I'm glad you're going to that new school, because you will not be around to bother me."
00:23:16.770,00:23:18.730,"-You don't mean that. -Yes, I do."
00:23:19.231,00:23:20.399,I don't need you.
00:23:20.482,00:23:23.068,"-Well, good! That's what I wanted. -Well, good!"
00:23:34.955,00:23:37.874,"-Hello? -Hey, Casey, it's Jayson..."
00:23:37.958,00:23:40.210,from Clayton Prep. I just got your e-mail.
00:23:42.254,00:23:43.255,You guys are prompt.
00:23:45.549,00:23:49.761,"Look, I just wanted to call to say I think you're awesome."
00:23:49.845,00:23:50.679,But?
00:23:51.847,00:23:52.973,But...
00:23:53.807,00:23:57.727,"I work at the admissions office, and I've been hearing some people talk."
00:23:57.811,00:23:58.770,You punched a girl?
00:24:00.480,00:24:01.314,Oh.
00:24:02.065,00:24:05.152,Yeah. But you don't know the whole story.
00:24:05.235,00:24:06.945,She was bullying somebody.
00:24:07.028,00:24:09.239,"Okay, okay, okay, look."
00:24:09.322,00:24:12.325,"Write a letter to the admissions office, and I'll do what I can."
00:24:12.409,00:24:15.370,But Clayton has a zero tolerance policy on violence.
00:24:15.454,00:24:17.247,I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
00:24:17.831,00:24:19.207,I have to go.
00:24:26.840,00:24:28.049,"Hey, babe."
00:24:30.135,00:24:31.344,Miles?
00:24:48.278,00:24:53.533,"And that is our youngest granddaughter, Charlie, which is short for Charlotte."
00:24:55.952,00:25:00.540,"Yeah, Casey, when she was in kindergarten, there was a child named Key."
00:25:00.624,00:25:01.750,-Right. -Yeah.
00:25:01.833,00:25:04.669,-A boy or a girl? -We weren't sure for the first few months.
00:25:06.046,00:25:09.174,"But she was a girl. Cute girl, nice. They were friends. Nice girl."
00:25:09.257,00:25:11.259,-Very sweet. -So how are your kids?
00:25:11.968,00:25:13.678,-Really good. -Yeah.
00:25:13.762,00:25:16.556,Casey is getting recruited by that school Clayton Prep.
00:25:16.640,00:25:18.391,-Oh. -For a track scholarship.
00:25:18.475,00:25:20.560,"Yeah, we went for a tour the other day, on the campus."
00:25:20.644,00:25:22.020,-Scholarship. -Yeah. It'd be great.
00:25:25.482,00:25:28.526,"'cause, you know, we're usually so focused on Sam and so..."
00:25:28.610,00:25:30.737,-Why? What's going on with Sam? -He's good.
00:25:30.820,00:25:32.489,-You want more sangria? -I'm okay.
00:25:32.572,00:25:37.118,He doesn't tell me anything anymore. Right? I have become obsolete. He's 18.
00:25:38.119,00:25:39.162,"You know, so..."
00:25:39.829,00:25:43.250,"You know, it's like girls and dating."
00:25:46.878,00:25:49.798,"Especially with Sam, everything's a bit more, you know..."
00:25:49.881,00:25:50.966,"No, what?"
00:25:51.716,00:25:53.051,"Mm, 'cause of his autism."
00:25:54.970,00:25:55.804,Sam's autistic?
00:25:57.931,00:25:59.140,Yeah.
00:26:03.395,00:26:04.521,Um...
00:26:12.570,00:26:14.197,The subject never came up?
00:26:14.281,00:26:16.700,"No, Chuck and I don't really talk about that stuff."
00:26:17.993,00:26:19.619,Uh-huh. I get it.
00:26:19.703,00:26:20.704,You get what?
00:26:20.787,00:26:22.038,It's like my friend Diego.
00:26:22.122,00:26:25.083,Do you remember Diego from when I worked with him at the salon?
00:26:25.166,00:26:26.001,Yeah.
00:26:26.084,00:26:29.045,It took him over a year to tell me he was gay.
00:26:29.129,00:26:31.840,He still carries a lot of shame about his sexuality.
00:26:32.424,00:26:34.593,It's a big deal for him to be out at work.
00:26:34.676,00:26:37.762,"Well, he works in a hair salon, and he's not comfortable being gay?"
00:26:37.846,00:26:41.975,It's the same with you. You're not out at work because you're ashamed.
00:26:42.058,00:26:43.268,"No, I'm not ashamed."
00:26:43.852,00:26:45.520,"Elsa, I'm not ashamed of anything."
00:26:46.271,00:26:47.230,Okay?
00:26:47.314,00:26:51.443,I just like to keep my work life and my personal life separate. I'm not ashamed.
00:26:51.526,00:26:53.862,-Mm-hmm. -It's just how I am. It's a guy thing.
00:26:53.945,00:26:59.367,"Yeah, I just could never be that way, not with someone I work with every day, someone I'm friends with."
00:26:59.451,00:27:01.077,It's a huge part of my identity.
00:27:01.161,00:27:03.121,"-Yeah, but maybe it shouldn't be. -What?"
00:27:03.204,00:27:06.207,Everything with you revolves around being a mom.
00:27:06.291,00:27:10.003,"And maybe sometime you should just, you know, be like an individual person."
00:27:10.086,00:27:12.088,I am an individual person.
00:27:12.172,00:27:13.423,"No, I don't think you are."
00:27:13.798,00:27:15.884,Everything is Sam this and autism that.
00:27:15.967,00:27:18.428,Maybe it's time to step back and have your own life.
00:27:23.058,00:27:26.019,It takes me a while to get used to new things.
00:27:26.102,00:27:30.273,"But once I get used to something, I come to rely on it."
00:27:41.201,00:27:42.118,Paige?
00:27:44.245,00:27:46.956,"-Sam, what are you doing here? -En Français."
00:27:47.707,00:27:50.251,"Uh, Sam, que fais-tu ici ?"
00:27:50.335,00:27:52.754,-Qui est ce garçon ? -Mon ex.
00:27:56.132,00:28:10.105,"Paige, I talked to my store manager and my therapist, and I realized that even though I hated it when you touched my stuff and stole my sweatshirt, I hated it even more when you were gone."
00:28:11.356,00:28:13.316,-Aw. -No aw.
00:28:13.900,00:28:22.117,"And now I understand that sometimes girls like to wear something that reminds them of their boyfriends, even when they're not there."
00:28:22.200,00:28:25.286,So I got you this necklace.
00:28:25.370,00:28:28.039,Zahid's mean girlfriend got me a discount at Claire's.
00:28:29.582,00:28:31.000,Mademoiselle Hardaway!
00:28:55.650,00:28:56.735,Happy birthday.
00:00:09.718,00:00:11.720,to reach the South Pole.
00:00:11.803,00:00:17.434,"A year and a half later, he arrived, only to discover that Roald Amundsen had beat him by 34 days."
00:00:18.393,00:00:24.816,"And if that weren't bad enough, on the journey home, Scott and his entire team froze to death on the punishing tundra."
00:00:28.862,00:00:30.572,That's what it makes me think of...
00:00:32.032,00:00:34.159,freezing to death under the night sky.
00:00:35.994,00:00:37.829,I want you to take me to Winter Formal.
00:00:38.621,00:00:45.962,-What? -Think about how much fun we would have with all the music and dancing and wearing fancy clothes.
00:00:46.046,00:00:48.048,Those are three of my least favorite things.
00:00:48.131,00:00:51.551,"Oh, and raisins, because I don't like to eat things with wrinkles."
00:00:52.093,00:00:55.180,"Okay, but, Sam, this is really important to me."
00:00:55.263,00:00:59.934,"I've never been to a dance with a date that wasn't a relative, and now I have a boyfriend."
00:01:00.018,00:01:02.437,"It's like the stars have aligned for us, you know?"
00:01:07.108,00:01:11.654,I guess I could sit in the hallway outside of the gym with my headphones on until it's over.
00:01:11.738,00:01:14.532,I'll bring a Ziploc full of crackers in case I get hungry.
00:01:15.658,00:01:17.035,"What? No, that's boring."
00:01:17.118,00:01:19.037,Not to me. I like crackers.
00:01:19.120,00:01:24.042,Did you know that Ritz Crackers have seven holes so that they don't get air bubbles during baking?
00:01:25.293,00:01:28.254,"You know, my parents are gonna be out of town that night."
00:01:28.963,00:01:31.633,"So I was thinking that maybe afterwards, you could..."
00:01:33.218,00:01:34.219,come over?
00:01:34.302,00:01:36.888,Why would I want to go to your house? You have terrible snacks.
00:01:36.971,00:01:39.224,"Plus, I'll probably be tired and ready for bed."
00:01:39.307,00:01:42.268,"Come on, Sam. What do I have to do to get you to go to the dance?"
00:01:43.103,00:01:46.606,"If you ask them to turn the music off so that it was silent, that would be nice."
00:01:50.276,00:01:52.487,A dance without music would be a dance without people.
00:01:53.404,00:01:54.864,"That sounds pretty good, too."
00:02:23.893,00:02:24.727,What?
00:02:24.811,00:02:26.354,It's the middle of the day.
00:02:27.897,00:02:29.023,So?
00:02:29.107,00:02:31.317,So you're using drugs in the middle of the day.
00:02:37.574,00:02:38.950,It's pot. It's not drugs.
00:02:39.033,00:02:40.034,Ah.
00:02:41.077,00:02:44.330,"-You want a hit? -Oh. Um, I-I can't."
00:02:44.998,00:02:46.916,"Ah, come on. Have some fun."
00:02:48.042,00:02:49.210,You deserve it.
00:02:50.128,00:02:51.004,I do?
00:02:52.005,00:02:53.172,More than anyone I know.
00:02:53.673,00:02:56.384,"Oh, I can't. What if somebody needs me?"
00:02:56.467,00:02:57.760,Do they?
00:03:21.409,00:03:23.953,"Elsa Gardner, you dirty dog."
00:03:24.037,00:03:25.663,"Hey, April."
00:03:25.747,00:03:29.626,"Look at you, shopping for lingerie. Is Doug the luckiest guy ever or what?"
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.545,Barry hasn't touched me in months.
00:03:32.629,00:03:35.298,"Not that I want him to, fat piece of shit."
00:03:36.049,00:03:36.925,How are you?
00:03:38.635,00:03:40.470,"Yeah, well, you certainly are."
00:03:40.553,00:03:43.056,You're glowing. What's your secret?
00:03:44.224,00:03:45.808,I don't have a secret.
00:03:45.892,00:03:49.229,"I'm just... you know, I'm an open book."
00:03:49.812,00:03:51.314,"Yeah, so..."
00:03:51.397,00:03:52.398,Hmm.
00:03:53.316,00:03:55.777,What are you doing in this neighborhood?
00:03:55.860,00:03:59.239,"-I'm sorry? -Well, you don't-- you don't live anywhere near here."
00:03:59.322,00:04:00.531,It's awfully far to come.
00:04:01.699,00:04:02.992,A sale.
00:04:03.076,00:04:03.910,Oh.
00:04:03.993,00:04:05.912,They're having 40% off.
00:04:05.995,00:04:10.291,"I have to get Casey so many white shirts, you know, for her Clayton uniform."
00:04:10.375,00:04:13.920,You wouldn't believe how many white shirts. I couldn't resist 40% off.
00:04:14.003,00:04:15.213,-Clayton Prep? -Mm-hmm.
00:04:15.296,00:04:18.800,"Wow. Uh, well... well, that's... that's big news."
00:04:19.425,00:04:22.345,"It's not a sure thing. I mean, she hasn't even gotten in yet."
00:04:22.428,00:04:25.848,I'm just jumping the gun 'cause of the sale and...
00:04:25.932,00:04:27.934,"Well, I should... I should run."
00:04:28.017,00:04:29.102,Okay.
00:04:29.811,00:04:31.062,-Bye. -Bye.
00:04:33.773,00:04:35.900,"Hey, this is Miles. You know what to do."
00:04:37.193,00:04:38.736,"Hey, it's me."
00:04:38.820,00:04:42.824,"I'm calling to say in case you were thinking of calling me, don't."
00:04:43.408,00:04:47.787,"I am much happier since you left suddenly, with no warning."
00:04:47.870,00:04:49.872,I am great.
00:04:49.956,00:05:02.135,"And even though you managed to take the TV, you left a bunch of other stuff that I don't want: your humidifier, your panini press, like, 15 kinds of hair gel."
00:05:02.802,00:05:04.929,You should probably come and get it.
00:05:05.013,00:05:08.099,Your hair looks kind of thin without product in it.
00:05:09.517,00:05:13.021,"Anyway, I'll just leave it all outside."
00:05:13.104,00:05:14.772,Hope it doesn't rain. Don't call.
00:05:15.648,00:05:16.691,Ow!
00:05:17.442,00:05:18.609,I'm fine. Goodbye.
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.659,What's up? What are we talking about?
00:05:26.743,00:05:30.830,Hope it's the lacrosse team getting their eyebrows pierced; that's hilarious.
00:05:30.913,00:05:32.415,We got to go. Come on.
00:05:35.835,00:05:37.587,That was weird. What's up with them?
00:05:41.215,00:05:42.300,Sharice!
00:05:43.092,00:05:46.262,-What the hell? -They're upset you're leaving for Clayton.
00:05:46.345,00:05:47.847,How did they know about Clayton?
00:05:47.930,00:05:55.271,"No clue, but I've been getting e-mails all day from the mothers asking if we're still going to make it to the finals without you. Spoiler alert... nope."
00:05:56.272,00:05:59.567,"Anyway, just try to take it as a compliment."
00:06:02.278,00:06:03.237,Yeah.
00:06:04.322,00:06:06.115,Totally feels like a compliment.
00:06:06.991,00:06:08.534,I can't find my work pants.
00:06:08.618,00:06:10.536,You know where my work pants are?
00:06:10.620,00:06:12.330,They're folded in a pile on the bed.
00:06:12.413,00:06:13.498,Okay.
00:06:14.207,00:06:15.541,"What, are you still mad at me?"
00:06:15.625,00:06:19.712,"What, for having so much shame about Sam's autism that you never mentioned it at work?"
00:06:19.796,00:06:21.297,-Yep. -Good to know.
00:06:25.051,00:06:27.637,"Oh, that's nice. Do you want to talk, honey?"
00:06:27.720,00:06:29.055,"Nope, I don't."
00:06:29.639,00:06:32.016,"The track team is freezing me out, and it's your fault."
00:06:32.100,00:06:34.143,"Um, how is it my fault?"
00:06:34.227,00:06:37.563,-You blabbed to JJ's mom about Clayton. -April?
00:06:40.191,00:06:42.902,-Did I? I ran into April at the mall. -Uh-huh.
00:06:43.611,00:06:45.488,-I don't know if... I can't remember... -Mom?
00:06:45.571,00:06:47.156,"Okay, I mentioned Clayton."
00:06:47.240,00:06:49.867,Now the girls are pissed at me for betraying the team.
00:06:49.951,00:06:52.495,And I'm probably not gonna get into Clayton anyway.
00:06:52.578,00:06:56.165,"Why wouldn't you get in? Wait, Casey, I'm sorry. I didn't know it was a secret."
00:06:56.249,00:06:58.876,I will try and smooth things over with the other moms.
00:06:58.960,00:07:01.921,"-No, Mom, don't call anyone. -Okay, I won't. Maybe just April."
00:07:02.004,00:07:03.673,-Mom! -Okay!
00:07:11.597,00:07:15.017,Paige is making me go with her to the Winter Formal Dance at school.
00:07:15.101,00:07:16.102,Sounds dumb.
00:07:16.185,00:07:17.770,That sucks.
00:07:17.854,00:07:22.775,"And after, she wants me to come over to her house because her parents are at a wedding in Pittsburgh."
00:07:22.859,00:07:23.985,Back up.
00:07:24.068,00:07:27.029,"Paige's parents are gonna be gone, and she wants you to come over?"
00:07:27.655,00:07:29.782,"-Yes. -Dude, that's awesome."
00:07:30.408,00:07:32.952,-Why? -Because it means she wants to get down.
00:07:35.288,00:07:36.205,"Sex, dude."
00:07:38.082,00:07:39.917,I-I don't think so.
00:07:40.001,00:07:42.128,Paige didn't say anything about having sex.
00:07:42.211,00:07:44.130,"Well, of course she didn't say anything."
00:07:44.213,00:07:46.674,Girls don't say stuff like that. They use code words.
00:07:46.757,00:07:50.011,"I'm telling you, come over is lady talk for have sex."
00:07:53.306,00:07:56.976,"Trust me, she wants to take the D-Train to Bonetown."
00:07:58.603,00:08:01.564,Sex again. Just always assume I mean sex.
00:08:03.941,00:08:05.651,-I'm gonna ask her. -Don't ask her.
00:08:05.735,00:08:07.695,"-Excuse me, Paige? -Mm-hmm?"
00:08:07.778,00:08:12.658,"When you said that I should come over after the dance, did you really mean have sex?"
00:08:14.744,00:08:16.787,"Uh, uh, maybe."
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.122,She said maybe.
00:08:18.748,00:08:20.541,"In this case, maybe means yes."
00:08:20.625,00:08:23.085,"-I'm gonna ask her. -Don't ask her, dude."
00:08:24.837,00:08:27.215,"When you said maybe, did you mean yes?"
00:08:28.633,00:08:29.759,"Yes, Sam."
00:08:29.842,00:08:31.219,She wants to have sex.
00:08:32.803,00:08:34.096,"Yes, you did."
00:08:35.389,00:08:39.227,The proposition of sex makes the dance seem much more worthwhile.
00:08:39.310,00:08:41.229,"So what are we waiting for, Cinderella?"
00:08:41.312,00:08:42.897,Let's get you ready for the ball.
00:08:42.980,00:08:45.983,"And by ball, I mean balls-deep."
00:08:53.407,00:08:55.535,I specifically asked you not to call anyone.
00:08:56.369,00:08:58.496,What are you doing? Why are you lying down?
00:08:58.579,00:09:01.123,"Turns out, someone made a mountain out of a molehill."
00:09:01.207,00:09:04.502,"-Seriously, you're weirding me out. -The girls are not angry at you."
00:09:04.585,00:09:06.546,They're just sad that you're leaving.
00:09:06.629,00:09:08.589,"No, I'm telling you, they're being assholes."
00:09:09.632,00:09:13.761,"All right, whatever. Some lady you barely know says that it's not true, you listen to her."
00:09:13.886,00:09:17.557,"Um, April Turner is not someone I barely know."
00:09:18.724,00:09:24.355,We almost shared a room together at the Ramada Inn for one of your out-of-town track meets.
00:09:24.438,00:09:26.983,"And we would have, except I had a scratchy throat."
00:09:27.608,00:09:28.609,"Okay, whatever. I..."
00:09:28.693,00:09:31.237,I don't know why I assumed you would listen to me anyway.
00:09:31.320,00:09:34.156,April assured me that JJ's dying to hang out with you.
00:09:34.240,00:09:37.660,She said the girls are getting together to go dress shopping for the dance.
00:09:37.743,00:09:39.745,-Mnh-mnh. Pass. Mnh-mnh. -Call her.
00:09:40.538,00:09:42.915,Sweetie... listen to me.
00:09:42.999,00:09:46.460,I know teenage girls can be mean and bitchy.
00:09:47.253,00:09:49.380,I was actually like that myself sometimes.
00:09:50.047,00:09:54.260,"-You? -I don't care about the other girls, but you and Sharice are best friends."
00:09:55.094,00:09:57.221,Don't let this get between you two.
00:10:02.184,00:10:03.185,I love you.
00:10:08.816,00:10:09.859,"Sam, come here."
00:10:10.610,00:10:13.529,Buying condoms is inherently embarrassing.
00:10:13.613,00:10:15.698,But you have nothing to be ashamed of.
00:10:16.365,00:10:18.868,-You-- -Hi. I need condoms to have sex.
00:10:18.951,00:10:20.995,"Uh, but I like to know what I'm purchasing."
00:10:21.078,00:10:23.039,-Can you answer some questions? -Shoot.
00:10:23.122,00:10:24.498,Can I try them on before I buy?
00:10:24.582,00:10:25.499,No.
00:10:25.583,00:10:28.044,-How do I put them on? -Check the Internet?
00:10:28.127,00:10:30.880,Did you know that originally condoms were made out of leather?
00:10:30.963,00:10:32.214,I did not.
00:10:32.298,00:10:35.760,"Can I return unused condoms if they don't fit, or I can't have sex?"
00:10:35.843,00:10:37.678,Absolutely not.
00:10:37.762,00:10:40.431,Some of the condoms say ribbed for her pleasure.
00:10:40.514,00:10:43.517,"Is that guaranteed? And if not, is there a number I can call?"
00:10:43.601,00:10:45.478,I've never been asked that before.
00:10:45.561,00:10:48.606,-Okay. Just a few more questions. -These are the ones you want.
00:10:51.025,00:10:53.944,"All right, Sammy. That's your ticket to ride."
00:10:54.028,00:10:56.739,"You, sir, are ready to take the D-Train to Bonetown."
00:10:57.657,00:10:59.659,Each condom is electronically tested. That's good.
00:11:13.172,00:11:14.340,Come in.
00:11:15.966,00:11:17.635,Doug. Hey.
00:11:17.718,00:11:19.345,-How are you? -Good.
00:11:19.428,00:11:21.263,I wanted to return this book.
00:11:21.347,00:11:22.973,-Thanks. Hope it helped. -It did.
00:11:23.057,00:11:26.602,I appreciated the conversation we had and the book.
00:11:26.685,00:11:29.855,They both helped. You're like my personal autism school.
00:11:31.440,00:11:32.608,"Well, happy to help."
00:11:35.569,00:11:36.987,Was there anything else?
00:11:37.071,00:11:37.988,No.
00:11:42.660,00:11:46.997,She got upset because I didn't tell one of my coworkers about Sam's autism.
00:11:47.081,00:11:48.916,"That's unfair, right?"
00:11:48.999,00:11:50.501,You don't want me to take sides.
00:11:50.584,00:11:52.211,"No. No, actually, I do."
00:11:52.294,00:11:54.088,"I'm right, right?"
00:11:55.005,00:12:04.974,"You know, Doug, I love that you feel comfortable talking to me, but lately, it seems like you might benefit from your own relationship with a therapist."
00:12:05.057,00:12:10.771,"'Cause, honestly, the more personal information we share, the more I worry about crossing some boundary as Sam's therapist."
00:12:10.855,00:12:13.107,-I get it. -I'm happy to give you a referral.
00:12:13.190,00:12:14.650,"Nah. No, thank you."
00:12:16.444,00:12:17.486,Why are you limping?
00:12:18.195,00:12:20.656,"Oh, I hurt my foot the other day. It's not a big deal."
00:12:21.323,00:12:23.576,"-Can you put your full weight on it? -God, no."
00:12:26.495,00:12:27.705,No.
00:12:27.788,00:12:29.915,"-Well, is it swollen? -A little."
00:12:31.208,00:12:32.793,"Okay, a lot."
00:12:32.877,00:12:34.587,"All right, come on. Let's go."
00:12:34.670,00:12:36.630,-What? -I'm gonna take you to the ER.
00:12:39.592,00:12:43.137,"Okay, I guess walking around on one foot in horrible pain is a solution?"
00:12:44.305,00:12:46.015,"Please, let me help you out, okay?"
00:12:46.098,00:12:48.601,You did me a favor. Can I please... Can I help you out?
00:12:51.645,00:12:53.522,"even friendship, can be complicated."
00:12:53.606,00:12:54.607,You can't force it.
00:12:54.690,00:12:56.901,I don't want to hang out with him. He's annoying.
00:12:56.984,00:13:00.154,It's rude to say that in front of him. He's right here.
00:13:00.237,00:13:02.490,"It's okay. I don't like Sam, either."
00:13:02.573,00:13:04.492,-He's a snoozefest. -See what I'm saying?
00:13:04.575,00:13:06.577,"Boys, I get my hair cut once every two years, okay?"
00:13:06.660,00:13:10.998,"All I ask for is 20 minutes in this kitchen, so I can spend a few months not looking like a yeti."
00:13:11.081,00:13:13.250,What are we supposed to talk about?
00:13:13.334,00:13:15.461,Why not try and find some common interests?
00:13:15.753,00:13:16.712,Upstairs.
00:13:20.674,00:13:21.717,Bridges?
00:13:22.259,00:13:23.219,No.
00:13:23.886,00:13:24.887,Glaciers?
00:13:24.970,00:13:25.804,No.
00:13:26.430,00:13:27.348,Dirt bikes?
00:13:27.932,00:13:29.642,No. Wildlife?
00:13:29.725,00:13:30.726,Ugh.
00:13:31.602,00:13:32.895,Sex?
00:13:34.230,00:13:35.147,Yes.
00:13:35.856,00:13:39.985,"I've never done it before, but I expect to soon, after the Winter Formal Dance."
00:13:40.069,00:13:41.987,What? With who?
00:13:42.071,00:13:43.364,My girlfriend Paige.
00:13:43.447,00:13:45.032,Have you gone through the bases?
00:13:45.908,00:13:46.742,What bases?
00:13:48.369,00:13:49.453,The bases.
00:13:50.162,00:13:52.790,"First base, kissing. Second base, boobs."
00:13:53.374,00:13:54.667,Third base is the privates.
00:13:54.750,00:13:57.169,And the home run? Sex.
00:13:57.253,00:13:58.587,That's the order it goes in.
00:13:58.671,00:14:01.590,"My cousin works at a car wash, and he knows all about girls."
00:14:01.674,00:14:03.092,That's a fortunate resource.
00:14:03.175,00:14:06.554,You can't have sex till you visit all the bases. It's a rule.
00:14:14.520,00:14:15.521,Yep.
00:14:25.322,00:14:26.782,"Casey, you have to try that on."
00:14:28.075,00:14:30.661,"No, no, no, no. It is so you."
00:14:30.744,00:14:35.374,"I'm probably not gonna go to the dance. Evan's, like, banned from school property."
00:14:37.751,00:14:38.752,Mm...
00:14:38.836,00:14:40.588,It's gonna look really cute on you.
00:14:41.380,00:14:42.506,"Okay, fine."
00:15:00.524,00:15:01.442,Yep.
00:15:07.406,00:15:08.616,"I'm sorry, Casey."
00:15:08.699,00:15:09.700,For what?
00:15:24.048,00:15:28.594,"Now I know it's getting late, but we have one last order of business."
00:15:28.677,00:15:32.181,Please welcome Newton High School senior Paige Hardaway.
00:15:44.777,00:15:48.072,"Whew! That was disorienting, wasn't it?"
00:15:49.365,00:15:55.329,"Well, for my boyfriend Sam, life is always like that all the time."
00:15:56.038,00:15:57.164,Um...
00:15:58.415,00:16:09.677,"You see, Sam has autism, which makes it really difficult for him to deal with situations where there's large groups of people and loud noises and unpredictable lighting."
00:16:09.760,00:16:19.269,"But should that mean that Sam is excluded from really fun things, like high school dances that his girlfriend also really, really, really wants to go to?"
00:16:19.353,00:16:20.980,No. It doesn't.
00:16:21.480,00:16:31.240,"So, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you Silent Night, an autism-friendly dance that is 100% silent."
00:16:31.323,00:16:33.242,"Let me guess, this is all your idea."
00:16:33.325,00:16:35.035,"No, I don't know anything about it."
00:16:35.119,00:16:37.705,I didn't know Sam was interested in going to the dance.
00:16:37.788,00:16:42.209,"And I already know what you're thinking. I mean, silent? That's crazy."
00:16:42.918,00:16:46.422,"What about the music, right? Well, there is gonna be music."
00:16:46.505,00:16:49.008,It will be piped in through wireless headphones.
00:16:49.091,00:16:55.931,"And I've already spoken to the people at Techtropolis, and they are willing to donate headphones for this event, which is super-cool of them."
00:16:57.057,00:17:04.356,"So in conclusion, I think that Newton High should be a place that's inclusive of all students."
00:17:06.608,00:17:08.235,That's it. Thank you.
00:17:11.071,00:17:13.240,"Okay, so if we're ready to vote?"
00:17:13.323,00:17:14.783,"Yes, April."
00:17:16.243,00:17:17.077,Hi.
00:17:18.328,00:17:21.915,"I made JJ an appointment, months ago, to get her hair done."
00:17:21.999,00:17:23.917,It's going to cost me about $80.
00:17:24.585,00:17:25.419,Um...
00:17:25.502,00:17:29.715,Now you want to flatten it with a bulky set of headphones.
00:17:29.798,00:17:32.384,I... I think maybe no.
00:17:32.468,00:17:35.387,"Um, you know what? Um, I'm a hairdresser."
00:17:35.471,00:17:39.558,"So I could do all the kids' hairdos for free, you know."
00:17:39.641,00:17:42.352,"-Oh, wow, that would be wonderful, yes. -Wow!"
00:17:45.230,00:17:52.571,"I mean, the Winter Formal is something that our kids have looked forward to their entire high school career."
00:17:53.155,00:17:56.450,Do we really need to change everything to accommodate one kid?
00:17:57.242,00:17:59.578,"I mean, a silent dance, it's just so..."
00:18:00.537,00:18:01.914,"you know, it's sad."
00:18:07.419,00:18:08.879,"Well, maybe we should vote."
00:18:08.962,00:18:10.297,You know what's sad?
00:18:11.381,00:18:18.555,"My son never being able to attend a school event, because the sounds are so overwhelming."
00:18:18.639,00:18:26.105,"You know, never being invited to a birthday party, because he was the kid at Chuck E. Cheese who couldn't stop screaming."
00:18:26.188,00:18:33.278,"The isolation, the loneliness, the lack of experience..."
00:18:35.531,00:18:36.782,that's sad.
00:18:38.033,00:18:43.038,"Your perfectly healthy kids not being able to get an updo, it's just not on my list."
00:18:43.872,00:18:44.706,So...
00:18:47.543,00:18:49.670,Okay. Shall we vote?
00:18:50.337,00:18:51.380,All the ayes?
00:18:53.632,00:18:55.259,And the nays?
00:18:56.593,00:18:58.303,"Well, the ayes have it."
00:18:58.387,00:19:01.723,"-Silent dance, here we come. -Yay!"
00:19:01.807,00:19:04.560,"That's it, everybody. Thank you. Meeting's adjourned."
00:19:10.107,00:19:11.024,"Hey, April."
00:19:11.692,00:19:16.363,"Um, I'm just curious why you voted against the silent dance?"
00:19:17.531,00:19:20.242,Because the world doesn't revolve around you.
00:19:20.325,00:19:21.952,-I'm sorry? -You should be.
00:19:22.035,00:19:24.663,"Oh, and I'm sure Casey's gonna love it at Clayton Prep."
00:19:24.746,00:19:27.791,Never mind what happens to our girls' chances at a state title.
00:19:27.875,00:19:32.171,-What does she have to do with this... -Casey is the anchor in our relay.
00:19:32.254,00:19:34.464,There's no way our girls are gonna qualify without her.
00:19:34.548,00:19:38.093,But who cares about that? Right?
00:19:49.271,00:19:51.356,"Case, hey, hon. You okay?"
00:19:51.440,00:19:53.734,"We put our customers first, so I'm going to help you out."
00:19:56.278,00:19:59.531,"Sir, I got to handle this. Any other nerd in a blue shirt can help you."
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.367,What's up?
00:20:02.451,00:20:04.578,How can I have sex when I've never even seen boobs?
00:20:04.703,00:20:06.872,"Oh, is that what's going on?"
00:20:06.955,00:20:10.292,"Look, when I was a kid, I was terrified of the water."
00:20:10.375,00:20:16.256,"Then my dad decided it was time for me to learn to swim, so he threw me in the deep end at Holiday Inn."
00:20:16.340,00:20:19.176,"Now I swim like an otter. You probably know all about those, huh?"
00:20:19.259,00:20:24.181,"Of course. They can stay underwater for up to four minutes, but what does swimming have to do with sex?"
00:20:35.067,00:20:36.401,This isn't a swimming pool.
00:20:36.985,00:20:38.737,Nope. It's a titty club.
00:20:38.820,00:20:42.991,"This way, you'll know what to expect and won't lose your shit when you see Paige's boobs."
00:20:43.075,00:20:48.372,"And bonus, my cousin Sunil caters the buffet here and it is off the chain!"
00:20:48.455,00:20:50.082,This guy knows what I'm talking 'bout.
00:20:52.417,00:20:53.377,Okay.
00:20:54.002,00:20:54.920,You ready for this?
00:20:57.172,00:20:58.090,Yes.
00:21:20.654,00:21:22.531,Nope! Not doing that.
00:21:22.614,00:21:24.783,"Too many lights, too much sound. No way."
00:21:24.866,00:21:26.827,"Okay, maybe that was a bad idea."
00:21:27.619,00:21:32.499,"Come to think of it, I still have a recurring nightmare where I'm being eaten by a pool raft shaped like my dad."
00:21:32.958,00:21:34.835,You think that's connected?
00:21:34.918,00:21:36.795,"Hey, man. It's okay."
00:21:36.878,00:21:38.130,You did good.
00:21:39.298,00:21:42.301,But I was kind of looking forward to the goat curry tacos.
00:21:42.384,00:21:44.761,Have your tacos. I'll wait out here.
00:21:44.845,00:21:46.638,I'll be quick. I won't get a lap dance.
00:21:46.722,00:21:48.515,"Just one plate, then we're out of here. Cool?"
00:21:56.857,00:21:59.693,"I work here and this place can be too much for me, too."
00:21:59.776,00:22:01.278,I use earplugs.
00:22:01.778,00:22:05.532,"Earplugs can actually cause tinnitus, which is a ringing in the ears."
00:22:10.203,00:22:11.913,-I'm Destiny. -I'm Sam Gardner.
00:22:12.873,00:22:15.542,"So why are you standing out here all alone, Sam Gardner?"
00:22:16.585,00:22:20.047,"My girlfriend wants to have sex, but I'm nervous and ill-prepared."
00:22:23.091,00:22:25.594,"-Want some advice? -Yes, please."
00:22:27.804,00:22:31.016,Just be kind to her. That's all that really matters.
00:22:33.518,00:22:35.979,"At a certain point, biology will just take over."
00:22:36.563,00:22:38.190,Biology is my favorite subject.
00:22:38.273,00:22:39.566,Good for you.
00:22:40.817,00:22:44.154,But just so that you'll feel a little more prepared.
00:22:51.828,00:22:52.829,Oh.
00:22:53.622,00:22:54.456,Wow.
00:22:55.123,00:22:56.875,Yeah. I know.
00:22:58.376,00:22:59.961,Good luck with your girlfriend.
00:23:02.422,00:23:03.757,"'Sup, Destiny?"
00:23:03.840,00:23:05.050,"Hey, Zahid."
00:23:06.718,00:23:08.011,What did I miss?
00:23:15.018,00:23:16.770,I got a fraud alert on my credit card.
00:23:16.853,00:23:19.147,You have to pick the most expensive dress in the store?
00:23:21.483,00:23:22.984,"Oh, honey."
00:23:23.068,00:23:25.821,I'm joking. I'm just kidding you.
00:23:30.659,00:23:32.369,I don't want to go to Clayton Prep.
00:23:33.537,00:23:34.496,Okay.
00:23:35.497,00:23:37.332,And honestly...
00:23:39.376,00:23:41.169,I don't know if I can go.
00:23:45.090,00:23:50.053,-I know. I check in with them. -Then why are you telling people that I'm going to go there and buying me shirts?
00:23:50.137,00:23:53.765,"Because I think you're amazing, and I think you're gonna get in anyway."
00:23:54.975,00:23:56.059,I'm just...
00:23:56.143,00:23:57.227,I'm...
00:23:58.562,00:24:04.359,I'm scared because I don't want to leave you guys and Evan and my team.
00:24:04.943,00:24:08.655,Just the whole Clayton Prep thing is starting to feel kind of like...
00:24:09.823,00:24:10.866,Selfish.
00:24:10.949,00:24:12.450,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:24:12.534,00:24:14.202,Even Sharice turned against me.
00:24:14.286,00:24:16.163,No. Sharice is your best friend.
00:24:16.246,00:24:18.915,"When you were little, she followed you like a puppy dog."
00:24:18.999,00:24:20.917,"No, she was the one that stole my clothes."
00:24:21.001,00:24:22.460,She's a little bitch.
00:24:28.091,00:24:29.176,Honey...
00:24:29.926,00:24:32.095,It's okay to be a little selfish.
00:24:36.308,00:24:37.767,"Thanks, Mom."
00:24:39.060,00:24:40.312,"You kept the tags on, right?"
00:24:40.395,00:24:41.479,Duh.
00:24:48.111,00:24:49.112,How's your foot?
00:24:49.779,00:24:53.033,"They have to do an x-ray to make sure, but they think it's fractured."
00:24:53.116,00:24:54.075,I'm such an idiot.
00:24:54.159,00:24:55.911,I'm sure I've seen way more idiotic.
00:24:57.996,00:24:59.915,"Yeah, well, thanks for making me come."
00:24:59.998,00:25:02.125,I would've ignored this forever if it weren't for you.
00:25:02.209,00:25:06.087,No problem. And I wanted to apologize about asking you about my own stuff.
00:25:07.088,00:25:10.926,"I know you're Sam's therapist, and you try to keep things professional."
00:25:11.635,00:25:13.845,-Yeah. -All right. I'll see you later.
00:25:15.931,00:25:16.932,My brother's...
00:25:18.099,00:25:19.893,My brother is autistic.
00:25:21.228,00:25:24.648,Jesse. He's not as high functioning as Sam.
00:25:24.731,00:25:26.149,He's minimally verbal.
00:25:26.733,00:25:33.156,"As a kid, we couldn't even walk through a parking lot because he'd have to stop behind every car and read the license plate."
00:25:34.074,00:25:39.371,But my parents didn't acknowledge he was on the spectrum till he was 16.
00:25:39.454,00:25:40.413,Hmm.
00:25:40.497,00:25:43.959,They kept insisting it was a speech issue and that he'd grow out of it.
00:25:45.877,00:25:51.424,The saddest thing in my life is wondering what he would've been like had he gotten interventions early.
00:25:52.175,00:25:54.970,It's why I do what I do.
00:25:55.929,00:25:59.057,They didn't want to acknowledge it because they were ashamed.
00:25:59.140,00:26:03.520,They were afraid of the social isolation that comes with having a kid who's different.
00:26:04.896,00:26:06.815,And I feel for them.
00:26:07.440,00:26:09.484,You just want to pretend nothing's wrong.
00:26:10.944,00:26:13.321,"Yeah, well, I used to be really good at that."
00:26:16.074,00:26:18.243,"All right, I should get going."
00:26:18.326,00:26:22.622,"And I'm gonna take you up on that referral, if it's still okay."
00:26:23.290,00:26:24.791,Yeah. Totally cool.
00:26:24.874,00:26:26.126,-All right. -I'll e-mail you.
00:26:26.209,00:26:28.420,-Okay. Take it easy. -Thanks.
00:26:38.513,00:26:40.098,"Um, no, I just..."
00:26:41.182,00:26:43.184,I just wanted to apologize.
00:26:44.769,00:26:45.603,What?
00:26:45.687,00:26:49.608,The way I handled the thing with Chuck and not telling him about Sam.
00:26:51.735,00:26:53.278,I don't know. I don't know.
00:26:53.361,00:26:54.946,There's a part of me that's...
00:27:05.290,00:27:06.791,"Oh, honey."
00:27:06.875,00:27:12.505,"I don't know why, but I'm going to try to continue to figure it out and deal with it better and..."
00:27:12.589,00:27:16.676,"I just-- I'm sorry, okay?"
00:27:17.677,00:27:18.720,I know.
00:27:19.929,00:27:20.805,All right.
00:27:20.889,00:27:23.183,"Um, are you home yet?"
00:27:23.266,00:27:25.101,"No. I just have, um..."
00:27:25.935,00:27:28.855,I have one little thing to do and then I'll be home soon.
00:27:28.938,00:27:31.775,"Okay, well, I'll see you soon, and I love you, okay?"
00:27:33.318,00:27:34.361,Bye.
00:27:41.659,00:27:44.496,I really need to get to youth group.
00:27:44.579,00:27:46.164,"Yeah, I don't think so, Sharice."
00:27:47.123,00:27:48.083,Where are we going?
00:27:49.209,00:27:53.296,I've known you since the third grade. I've hand-washed your retainer.
00:27:54.172,00:27:56.758,I keep mint-flavored Oreos at the house for you.
00:27:57.509,00:28:00.720,"Now I want to know what's going on, and I want to know now."
00:28:04.474,00:28:06.142,"Okay, I know."
00:28:06.226,00:28:08.144,"I messed up, and I'm so sorry."
00:28:09.521,00:28:11.272,"Casey's my best friend, and..."
00:28:11.356,00:28:16.111,When I heard you were leaving I just got upset. I can't believe you didn't tell me.
00:28:16.945,00:28:20.073,"Well, I didn't want to jinx it. And I'm not even in the school yet."
00:28:20.156,00:28:22.075,You don't tell me anything anymore.
00:28:22.158,00:28:27.956,"You've got a boyfriend, and I never see you, and you got your hair cut without even talking to me about it."
00:28:28.039,00:28:29.249,Okay.
00:28:30.041,00:28:31.042,Okay.
00:28:32.043,00:28:34.129,"-I'm sorry. -Me, too."
00:28:34.879,00:28:36.047,Come here.
00:28:40.135,00:28:42.804,"Sharice, this is dumb."
00:28:43.555,00:28:45.765,But do you want to be my date to the dance?
00:28:46.683,00:28:50.520,Are you only asking me 'cause Evan can't go because he's a thief?
00:28:50.603,00:28:51.604,Yes.
00:28:51.688,00:28:53.273,I'd love to!
00:28:54.774,00:28:55.734,Come on.
00:28:57.819,00:28:59.362,Yuck. Your feet stink.
00:29:00.071,00:29:01.322,What are you drawing?
00:29:02.532,00:29:04.909,A portrait of a wise woman I met today.
00:29:04.993,00:29:07.579,"Oh, my God! Try to unsee! Try to unsee!"
00:29:07.662,00:29:13.376,I'm familiarizing myself with the female body -in anticipation of losing my virginity. -Try to unhear! Try to unhear!
00:29:13.460,00:29:15.336,"-Oh, my God, Sam! -What?"
00:29:15.420,00:29:17.422,That's disgusting! You need to put that away!
00:29:17.505,00:29:19.340,"-Seriously, don't-- -I'm not putting it away."
00:29:19.424,00:29:21.384,-Erase it. Who taught you that? -It's beautiful.
00:29:21.468,00:29:23.470,-What was that? Ew! -Destiny taught me that.
00:29:25.472,00:29:27.307,"-Sam, that's a serious problem. -I'm not."
00:29:33.146,00:29:34.647,She was very nice.
00:29:39.652,00:29:40.570,Finally.
00:29:40.653,00:29:43.865,My phone died an hour ago. I've been sitting alone with my thoughts.
00:29:43.948,00:29:46.868,"And I'm in the middle of a breakup, so that is not a fun place to be."
00:29:46.951,00:29:49.245,"Well, we won't be performing an x-ray today."
00:29:49.954,00:29:52.123,Why not? My ankle's okay?
00:29:52.999,00:29:55.376,"Miss Sasaki, are you aware you're pregnant?"
00:00:08.508,00:00:09.801,for helping with this.
00:00:09.884,00:00:11.886,That is so nice of you.
00:00:11.970,00:00:14.639,"I mean, honestly, it's not even your school."
00:00:14.723,00:00:17.851,It's amazing that your school's doing an autism-friendly dance.
00:00:17.934,00:00:21.521,Our school is shit. Literally there was a shit in the hallway last week.
00:00:23.106,00:00:26.192,"Well, you are all invited to come and bring your kids."
00:00:26.276,00:00:27.777,You do not want me to bring Addie.
00:00:27.902,00:00:31.823,She's in a phase where she's telling everyone to stick their head up their ass.
00:00:31.906,00:00:34.868,"The other day, I got so sick of it, I hid in the garage for an hour."
00:00:34.951,00:00:36.244,Good for you.
00:00:36.327,00:00:38.455,Self-care is so important.
00:00:39.581,00:00:42.000,"What about you, Elsa? Doing any self-care lately?"
00:00:42.083,00:00:43.376,Um...
00:00:48.465,00:00:50.383,"Nope. Same old, same old."
00:00:50.467,00:00:52.552,Really? No new hobbies?
00:00:52.635,00:00:55.388,"Because, honestly, you seem very happy."
00:00:56.014,00:00:57.348,"What's up, girl?"
00:00:57.432,00:00:59.768,Are you just naturally that perfect?
00:01:01.519,00:01:04.898,"I'm not perfect at all. In fact, actually, um..."
00:01:06.107,00:01:08.693,I have sort of taken up a new hobby.
00:01:08.777,00:01:09.944,"I've been, um..."
00:01:11.571,00:01:12.405,bowling.
00:01:15.116,00:01:16.409,Bowling? Really?
00:01:16.493,00:01:17.494,Yeah.
00:01:17.577,00:01:19.496,"It's crazy. Weird, right?"
00:01:19.579,00:01:20.789,But it's so much fun.
00:01:22.707,00:01:26.085,And I think it's making me a better mom and a better wife.
00:01:26.169,00:01:27.462,Bowling did all that?
00:01:27.545,00:01:33.134,"Yeah. But, you know, sometimes I feel so guilty about bowling that I want to kill myself."
00:01:33.218,00:01:35.637,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You keep bowling, lady."
00:01:35.720,00:01:37.013,I am inspired.
00:01:37.764,00:01:39.599,I might have to take up bowling myself.
00:01:40.350,00:01:43.895,"Kathy, you need bowling more than anyone I've ever met."
00:01:58.034,00:01:59.994,there are always new rules to learn.
00:02:00.078,00:02:01.621,We hold hands in the hall now.
00:02:01.704,00:02:03.248,Okay.
00:02:03.331,00:02:06.960,I can't believe you're abandoning me to go to that fancy school.
00:02:07.836,00:02:09.295,Who am I gonna be friends with?
00:02:09.379,00:02:11.381,"-I hate everyone else. -Dude, calm down."
00:02:11.464,00:02:17.971,"Admissions is this week, and I haven't heard anything, so I'm probably not going, which means that I won't be going anywhere..."
00:02:18.471,00:02:19.973,and my heart will be crushed.
00:02:20.056,00:02:21.432,Let's hope so.
00:02:23.852,00:02:25.228,-Silent dance? -Mm-hmm.
00:02:25.311,00:02:26.646,What's a silent dance?
00:02:32.026,00:02:36.406,"Drug kids started it to have raves in the woods, but they're great for people with sensory issues."
00:02:36.489,00:02:39.993,Who knew that meth heads and people on the spectrum had some of the same needs?
00:02:41.161,00:02:42.912,Shoot. Was that insensitive to say?
00:02:42.996,00:02:43.830,-Yes. -I don't know.
00:02:43.913,00:02:45.999,You organized this whole thing just for Sam?
00:02:46.082,00:02:48.042,"-Yeah. -That's pretty cool, Paige."
00:02:48.126,00:02:50.962,"Yeah, well, that's what you do when you're in love."
00:02:55.049,00:02:58.720,Sam! Oh! That's the first time we've said that to each other.
00:02:58.803,00:03:00.930,-That's so special. -I didn't say anything.
00:03:01.764,00:03:03.182,"-Okay, we're gonna go. -Bye."
00:03:03.266,00:03:04.309,Mm-hmm.
00:03:04.392,00:03:09.063,"Okay, I know that because of your autism, you might not know if you love me yet, and that's totally fine."
00:03:10.607,00:03:17.697,"But if you could figure it out by Thursday, that'd be great, because we're having dinner with my whole family and we could break the news to them then."
00:03:23.286,00:03:24.746,It's about the baby.
00:03:24.829,00:03:26.998,I'm tired of leaving you messages.
00:03:27.081,00:03:30.126,"Obviously, you don't care about this pregnancy, and that's fine."
00:03:30.752,00:03:37.550,"I was really upset about it before, but I can see now that if you can't be bothered to call back, well, we're better off without you."
00:03:38.509,00:03:39.636,I'm okay with that.
00:03:40.136,00:03:42.388,I feel good about it.
00:03:44.224,00:03:45.266,"Goodbye, Miles."
00:03:56.611,00:03:57.987,Ahh!
00:04:03.534,00:04:08.289,"Buying a home theater system is a huge deal, but I'm here for you every step of the way."
00:04:08.373,00:04:10.083,-Paige loves me. -Got to go.
00:04:11.042,00:04:14.837,"Love? Dude, this is huge. I love love."
00:04:17.465,00:04:20.051,"-I didn't know what to say. -Well, do you love her?"
00:04:20.134,00:04:23.888,I need to figure it out by Thursday when I meet her parents at Olive Garden.
00:04:23.972,00:04:26.975,Totally. You cannot meet her parents unless you know it's for real.
00:04:27.058,00:04:29.143,'Cause what if you like them?
00:04:29.227,00:04:36.693,"Next thing you know, you and her dad will be going to baseball games, and he's calling you Z, which is nice 'cause your dad wasn't around that much."
00:04:36.776,00:04:41.656,"And then you and Tamra break up, and Steve won't return your calls."
00:04:41.739,00:04:45.159,"And then it's like you got dumped twice, and that really stings."
00:04:46.786,00:04:49.914,I'm pretty sure that Paige's dad is named Mario.
00:04:49.998,00:04:51.916,I remember 'cause Super Mario.
00:04:52.000,00:04:56.462,"The point is, you can't dive into all this unless you know you love her back."
00:05:00.383,00:05:03.177,I have condoms. I've seen boobs. I'm ready.
00:05:03.261,00:05:04.429,I'm sorry.
00:05:04.971,00:05:07.265,"That train has passed your stop, bro."
00:05:07.348,00:05:09.392,You're headed straight for Love Land.
00:05:09.475,00:05:16.858,"You can still visit Bone Town for sure, nice day trip, little vacay, pop in, buy a trinket, but not until you get this love business squared away."
00:05:18.359,00:05:20.069,how do I know if I'm in love?
00:05:23.656,00:05:24.657,You just know.
00:05:28.286,00:05:29.871,Paige told Sam that she loves him.
00:05:29.954,00:05:31.331,-She did? -Yeah.
00:05:31.414,00:05:33.041,-Whoa. That's huge. -I know.
00:05:33.124,00:05:36.919,They've only been dating for like two seconds. Less time than us.
00:05:38.296,00:05:40.882,"Yeah. Okay, then. Yeah."
00:05:40.965,00:05:41.924,Yeah.
00:05:47.221,00:05:48.598,"-Whoa! Mom! -Hey, you two."
00:05:48.681,00:05:51.642,"-Can you knock? -Uh, not on a closed door, I can't."
00:05:52.393,00:05:55.897,"You know the rule... boy's inside, nothing to hide. I just made that up."
00:05:57.315,00:06:03.821,"Thank you. There's snacks downstairs... baby carrots and something I thought was hummus, but tastes like vegetables."
00:06:03.905,00:06:06.949,"Oh, you know, actually, I should... I should probably get going."
00:06:07.033,00:06:09.911,"But it was really good to see you, Mrs. Gardner. And, um..."
00:06:14.415,00:06:15.500,All right.
00:06:16.626,00:06:17.627,Bye.
00:06:18.711,00:06:20.505,Take a carrot for the road.
00:06:22.048,00:06:23.674,-Okay. Yeah. -Okay.
00:06:29.138,00:06:30.139,Okay.
00:06:31.933,00:06:33.518,That looked hot and heavy.
00:06:34.602,00:06:37.105,I'm saying that we've never really had the talk.
00:06:37.188,00:06:38.481,Mm-hmm.
00:06:38.564,00:06:41.776,-Yeah. -I'm here if you want to launch right in.
00:06:41.859,00:06:43.111,-I'm good. -Or...
00:06:46.948,00:06:52.411,"Oh, I'm, you know-- Well, if you need me, I'm here."
00:06:55.414,00:06:56.833,Mom?
00:06:59.085,00:07:01.629,"I don't want to make, like, a big thing out of it..."
00:07:02.547,00:07:03.589,but we're not having sex.
00:07:05.174,00:07:07.385,"I'm not ready, so..."
00:07:09.011,00:07:10.096,"So, yeah, you can go."
00:07:10.805,00:07:11.848,Okay.
00:07:18.312,00:07:19.897,I just want to say one thing.
00:07:19.981,00:07:22.567,I'm really glad you shared that with me.
00:07:27.905,00:07:32.368,"Because I always wanted a girl, and I always imagined we'd share girl stuff."
00:07:32.452,00:07:37.081,"And you never have with me, but I feel like we're getting closer now."
00:07:37.165,00:07:38.249,Okay.
00:07:45.047,00:07:49.260,"that you will talk to me about it then, too, because it's a big decision..."
00:07:49.343,00:07:50.344,Okay.
00:07:50.428,00:07:54.056,...and it's a big moment in your life and you need to be thoughtful about it.
00:07:54.140,00:07:56.434,-Okay. -Okay. Goodbye.
00:07:56.517,00:07:57.602,I love you.
00:08:07.820,00:08:12.950,"but sometimes it feels like, as soon as you learn the rules, they change."
00:08:17.371,00:08:19.499,"Hey, honey, I have a free day tomorrow."
00:08:35.806,00:08:38.392,"If you can read this, you suck."
00:08:39.143,00:08:40.144,Thank you.
00:09:09.131,00:09:10.091,Hey.
00:09:10.174,00:09:11.300,"Oh, hey."
00:09:12.009,00:09:14.720,"Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here."
00:09:14.804,00:09:16.138,Not in public.
00:09:19.600,00:09:20.601,What is all this?
00:09:20.685,00:09:23.187,"It's, uh, an impromptu memorial."
00:09:23.271,00:09:24.772,I still can't believe it.
00:09:24.855,00:09:26.148,Meatball died.
00:09:26.232,00:09:30.027,-Meatball is... -You met Meatball. He worked here.
00:09:30.778,00:09:31.654,Right.
00:09:31.737,00:09:35.116,"So, Meatball was, um..."
00:09:35.199,00:09:37.243,"Big guy, goatee."
00:09:40.871,00:09:42.123,"-Oh, right. -Yeah."
00:09:42.206,00:09:43.624,Meatball. Yeah.
00:09:46.127,00:09:47.503,"-Yeah, he did. -Yeah."
00:09:47.587,00:09:49.880,I'm gonna let you go so you can be with...
00:09:49.964,00:09:52.925,"Actually, you know, it really cheers me up, you being here..."
00:09:54.051,00:09:55.428,if you don't mind staying.
00:09:56.554,00:09:57.888,"Oh, yeah, right."
00:09:57.972,00:09:59.724,No. Sure. Sure.
00:10:00.850,00:10:01.726,You're the best.
00:10:05.896,00:10:07.732,"Oh, hey."
00:10:07.815,00:10:09.358,I'm so sorry.
00:10:10.359,00:10:11.402,Come on.
00:10:24.582,00:10:25.708,Major crisis.
00:10:25.791,00:10:33.299,"We have lots of smaller decorations, and we've got snowflake garlands up the wazoo, even though I told Beth to stop making them half an hour ago."
00:10:33.382,00:10:37.094,I can't stop. I'm a machine... a garland-making machine.
00:10:40.097,00:10:42.141,It's a large space in there and it's just...
00:10:44.977,00:10:46.354,I just don't want...
00:10:46.437,00:10:53.027,-But how? -It would be such a bummer if people were bored at this dance. We need something that we could use as backdrops for photos or...
00:10:53.110,00:10:54.654,or hangout nooks.
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.364,Nooks are very important.
00:10:57.114,00:10:58.741,I can help with that.
00:10:58.824,00:10:59.700,You can?
00:10:59.784,00:11:06.874,"-You want me to build you an igloo? -Paige has been talking about it a lot, and if I tell her you're building one, I think that she'll stop."
00:11:06.957,00:11:09.669,"Plus, I know you know how because you built me one when I was nine."
00:11:09.752,00:11:12.755,-I always thought you hated that igloo. -No.
00:11:12.838,00:11:15.466,"The blocks weren't lined up properly, but it was pretty good."
00:11:15.549,00:11:17.051,And I bet you could do better now.
00:11:17.134,00:11:18.803,"Oh, Sam, I'm gonna, uh..."
00:11:19.387,00:11:22.014,I'm gonna build you the best damn igloo you've ever seen.
00:11:22.098,00:11:25.393,"The only other one I've seen is the one you made me, so I hope so."
00:11:28.562,00:11:29.814,"All right, well..."
00:11:30.856,00:11:31.982,you need anything else?
00:11:34.110,00:11:34.944,Yeah.
00:11:36.237,00:11:37.071,What is it?
00:11:38.322,00:11:41.784,"Paige says that she loves me, but I don't know if I love her."
00:11:41.867,00:11:45.246,"And Zahid says you just know, but I don't just know."
00:11:45.329,00:11:51.377,"And there's so much new stuff in my life, and I don't like new stuff unless it's exactly like the old stuff, but everything is new..."
00:11:52.086,00:11:54.296,"dancing, love, Olive Garden."
00:11:54.380,00:11:58.259,"-Olive Garden? -They have unlimited breadsticks, but what does that mean?"
00:11:58.342,00:12:00.219,There has to be some kind of limit.
00:12:00.302,00:12:02.054,"All right, just relax, Sam, okay?"
00:12:02.138,00:12:05.015,"We're gonna... We're gonna figure this stuff out, okay?"
00:12:05.099,00:12:06.267,Okay.
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.609,Meet me in the supply closet.
00:12:16.277,00:12:17.319,What?
00:12:17.403,00:12:19.113,I figured out a way to make you feel better.
00:12:19.697,00:12:22.324,"Elsa, not right now."
00:12:23.701,00:12:25.202,I just...
00:12:25.286,00:12:26.370,That's not what I need.
00:12:26.454,00:12:29.623,But that's what we do for each other. That's how we help each other.
00:12:30.416,00:12:32.126,That's not all we do for each other.
00:12:33.961,00:12:36.839,"I want you around, you know, for support."
00:12:37.548,00:12:39.049,I'm sad today.
00:12:39.758,00:12:41.469,And I need my girl with me.
00:12:42.136,00:12:45.306,You know when you feel lost and you need your people around?
00:12:49.518,00:12:51.729,I need to go say hi to Meatball's brother.
00:12:52.480,00:12:53.314,You want to meet him?
00:12:54.648,00:12:57.568,"Yeah, sure. Just give me a second, okay?"
00:12:58.611,00:12:59.653,Sounds good.
00:13:26.555,00:13:27.598,Hey.
00:13:28.182,00:13:29.558,I had some free time.
00:13:30.184,00:13:32.019,I thought I'd see what you were doing.
00:13:32.603,00:13:34.814,Here are some questions that I have.
00:13:34.897,00:13:38.108,What exactly is a never-ending pasta bowl? It must end somewhere.
00:13:38.192,00:13:41.362,"Can I have noodles with butter? And if not, why?"
00:13:41.445,00:13:44.823,"May I inspect your menus for stickiness? And, again, if not, why?"
00:13:47.368,00:13:53.374,"Sometimes before I go to a new place, my family takes me there ahead of time to see what it's like."
00:13:59.588,00:14:00.464,-Hey. -Hey.
00:14:00.548,00:14:02.633,It's been a while since we've cased a joint.
00:14:04.969,00:14:08.305,"-Where were you coming from? -Um, a memorial."
00:14:08.973,00:14:12.268,"Yeah. Luisa... you know, my friend from group. Her cousin died."
00:14:12.351,00:14:14.353,"Oh. Oh, well, tell her I'm sorry."
00:14:14.436,00:14:16.981,I will. It's sad.
00:14:17.064,00:14:19.608,"Additionally, how many patrons do you serve a night?"
00:14:19.692,00:14:23.195,And especially I'm interested in how many excessively loud ones.
00:14:23.279,00:14:25.865,Let's get a table before this poor girl runs away screaming.
00:14:26.866,00:14:28.826,Pretty good pasta.
00:14:28.909,00:14:29.994,Excuse me.
00:14:30.077,00:14:32.288,I appreciate the moderately dressed salad.
00:14:32.913,00:14:34.081,A lot of places overdo that.
00:14:34.164,00:14:37.501,"Okay, I approve of the environment and the buttered noodles."
00:14:37.585,00:14:39.545,All I have to do is figure out if I love Paige.
00:14:41.755,00:14:42.631,Love?
00:14:45.384,00:14:46.427,You okay?
00:14:50.097,00:14:52.725,Love is a big emotion.
00:14:52.808,00:14:56.437,"It can take a long time to develop, or it can happen like that."
00:14:57.980,00:15:01.275,How did you know you loved Dad? And please be specific.
00:15:01.358,00:15:03.110,"Yeah, Mom, how did you know you loved Dad?"
00:15:03.944,00:15:06.864,"Um, well, that's a good question."
00:15:07.489,00:15:11.577,"Um, I guess because, um..."
00:15:13.037,00:15:15.915,"when I'd wake up, your dad was the first person I thought of."
00:15:17.583,00:15:19.001,Oh. That's nice.
00:15:19.501,00:15:21.503,-I didn't know that. -Be quiet.
00:15:21.587,00:15:22.713,Both of you be quiet.
00:15:22.796,00:15:24.089,I need to write this down.
00:15:25.174,00:15:27.927,"Okay, Dad, how did you know you loved Mom?"
00:15:28.510,00:15:29.803,Man. Oh...
00:15:29.887,00:15:30.930,Mom...
00:15:32.014,00:15:34.642,just makes me a better person.
00:15:35.309,00:15:38.520,"And so, you know, that's a big deal."
00:15:41.398,00:15:42.316,You do.
00:15:44.693,00:15:45.527,Okay.
00:15:46.111,00:15:47.780,Anything else about love?
00:15:47.863,00:15:50.115,Yeah. You always have your go-to person.
00:15:50.199,00:15:51.325,Yep.
00:15:51.408,00:15:55.204,"When anything happens, good or bad, you have the person you want to bring it to."
00:15:55.287,00:15:56.330,Very important.
00:15:56.413,00:15:59.833,"When I got my first job at the salon, I couldn't wait to tell your dad."
00:15:59.917,00:16:01.293,I remember. That was a big deal.
00:16:02.586,00:16:05.381,-You know another thing? -Rules work better in threes.
00:16:05.464,00:16:07.591,-Please don't say anything else. -All right.
00:16:08.258,00:16:09.802,"Well, if you're happy, I'm happy."
00:16:10.886,00:16:13.013,Me too. I'm happy.
00:16:40.457,00:16:43.919,Guess what. You were the first thing I thought about this morning.
00:16:44.003,00:16:45.462,That's so sweet.
00:16:46.046,00:16:48.590,You're the first thing I think about in the morning.
00:16:48.674,00:16:53.637,"Except for yesterday, when I woke up to my dog licking my face, and then my first thought was Aww."
00:16:59.935,00:17:01.854,I'm just so stressed about this dance.
00:17:01.937,00:17:04.898,I have a million things to do. My mind's going a mile a minute.
00:17:08.652,00:17:12.740,"When I'm stressed out, I like to recite the four subspecies of Antarctic penguins."
00:17:12.823,00:17:15.075,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:17:16.410,00:17:20.581,"Okay. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:17:21.874,00:17:23.751,Okay. That works a little bit.
00:17:24.668,00:17:25.753,"Oh, now pay up, mister."
00:17:25.836,00:17:26.920,Card.
00:17:28.881,00:17:30.507,Last one of the day.
00:17:31.050,00:17:32.426,Those went really fast.
00:17:33.218,00:17:34.803,I don't like this policy.
00:17:38.098,00:17:39.433,People need to know about it.
00:17:39.516,00:17:44.188,"I think it's working because the less you talk about Antarctica, the more we can talk about our relationship."
00:17:44.938,00:17:47.649,"And plus, it makes you less annoying. Not to me."
00:17:48.400,00:17:49.693,I find you adorable.
00:17:53.989,00:17:56.575,Would you say it's making me a better person?
00:17:57.326,00:17:58.243,Definitely.
00:18:10.005,00:18:11.715,Are you doing that to relieve stress?
00:18:11.799,00:18:13.258,"Because I do that, too."
00:18:13.342,00:18:16.220,"Knocking repeatedly on doors works, as well."
00:18:16.303,00:18:19.181,"I do four counts, but you can do any number you want."
00:18:19.264,00:18:22.726,No. I took advantage of the Techtropolis holiday sale and got a Fitbit.
00:18:22.810,00:18:24.353,Heart health. Know what I mean?
00:18:24.436,00:18:26.980,You should get one so we can take walks to clear our heads.
00:18:27.064,00:18:30.484,I don't like exercising. I'll let Paige know about the discount.
00:18:30.567,00:18:34.530,"She's in the market for an electronic pencil sharpener for home use, and..."
00:18:41.370,00:18:42.704,That's the third thing.
00:18:43.664,00:18:45.415,"Zahid, I think I love Paige."
00:18:45.499,00:18:47.000,Are you serious?
00:18:48.252,00:18:49.169,Man-hug time.
00:18:49.253,00:18:51.338,"Get over here, you little polar bear."
00:18:54.591,00:18:56.552,"Tight, right? You like pressure."
00:18:57.761,00:19:00.764,Hi. I bought a new TV. Is this where I pick it up?
00:19:01.557,00:19:02.391,Julia?
00:19:03.809,00:19:04.810,Sam?
00:19:05.853,00:19:08.647,Wow. I forgot you work at this Techtropolis.
00:19:08.730,00:19:10.732,I really wish I would have remembered.
00:19:10.816,00:19:12.818,"Julia? As in Julia, Julia?"
00:19:15.737,00:19:19.992,"I didn't think I would see anyone I knew today, or else I wouldn't have left the house like this."
00:19:20.659,00:19:22.411,You know what? I'll come back.
00:19:22.494,00:19:24.079,Why? I can help you.
00:19:24.163,00:19:26.081,"Oh, no, that's okay."
00:19:26.165,00:19:27.875,-What kind? -What?
00:19:27.958,00:19:29.459,Of TV did you buy?
00:19:29.543,00:19:31.545,"Oh, um..."
00:19:31.628,00:19:33.172,"Sony, I think?"
00:19:33.255,00:19:34.715,"Okay, well, you wait here."
00:19:34.798,00:19:37.384,"I'll check on it, and then help you take it to your car."
00:19:37.467,00:19:45.893,"I didn't used to do that because the old carts were stiff and hard to push, but the new ones are smooth and fast, and I like to pretend I'm in a video game. Be right back."
00:19:47.895,00:19:49.813,"So, Julia."
00:19:53.609,00:19:54.902,"It's a blanket, actually."
00:19:55.527,00:19:56.486,Oh.
00:19:57.237,00:19:59.031,Yes. Great.
00:20:09.041,00:20:11.293,-What are you screaming about? -I got in!
00:20:11.376,00:20:13.921,-Are you serious? -Yeah. That was Coach Pines on the phone.
00:20:14.004,00:20:16.006,She says that they want to give me a chance.
00:20:16.089,00:20:19.051,They want to give me a scholarship. I'm going to Clayton Prep!
00:20:19.134,00:20:20.552,"Oh, my God! Get over here!"
00:20:22.179,00:20:23.096,That's so good.
00:20:23.180,00:20:26.183,I'm so proud of you. We got to call Mom and tell her the good news.
00:20:26.266,00:20:29.102,We should go to Don's Pizza like we used to when you won races.
00:20:29.186,00:20:30.854,-You want to go? -Mnh.
00:20:30.938,00:20:33.190,"What? What, you want to go tell your boyfriend?"
00:20:34.483,00:20:35.734,You want a ride?
00:20:35.817,00:20:36.985,"No, no. I'm too excited."
00:20:37.069,00:20:39.988,"I can't sit still. I'm gonna take my bike, okay?"
00:20:40.072,00:20:41.615,"-Yeah. -Thank you so much, Dad."
00:20:41.698,00:20:43.367,-I love you so much. -I'm so proud of you.
00:20:43.450,00:20:44.493,Thank you.
00:20:48.538,00:20:50.832,You're all set with your new set.
00:20:50.916,00:20:51.750,Thanks.
00:20:52.376,00:20:53.961,"It's great to see you, Sam."
00:20:54.044,00:20:55.295,It made my day.
00:20:55.379,00:21:00.217,"There are a lot of times when seeing you has made my day, so I guess this is me paying you back."
00:21:00.926,00:21:02.344,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:21:02.427,00:21:06.181,"Actually, I'm really looking forward to our next session."
00:21:06.265,00:21:09.893,"I have so many new things to tell you about, about Paige and the dance."
00:21:09.977,00:21:11.603,The dance. Right.
00:21:14.898,00:21:17.484,"Oh, no, I can dance."
00:21:17.567,00:21:22.281,"My sister took a hip-hop lesson when she was nine, and my mom would make me sit in the lobby."
00:21:22.364,00:21:26.868,"And even though I tried to read my book, I accidentally memorized all the moves."
00:21:47.097,00:21:49.141,-That's really good. -I know. I know.
00:21:49.224,00:21:55.772,"I just hope that Paige doesn't want to slow dance, because I'm not prepared for that, so I'll just sit for those songs or stand."
00:21:55.856,00:21:58.400,No. Slow dancing's the easy part.
00:21:58.483,00:22:00.027,Not for me.
00:22:00.110,00:22:08.660,"When I was doing social-skills sessions in elementary school, we used a Hula-Hoop to learn about boundaries and how people don't like it when you stand too close."
00:22:08.744,00:22:14.666,"But I can't slow-dance with a Hula-Hoop, so I-I don't know how I'm supposed to know how close to stand."
00:22:15.667,00:22:17.627,Okay. Try this.
00:22:18.962,00:22:21.381,Think of personal space on a scale of one to three.
00:22:21.465,00:22:26.470,"Three would be with your arms out, fully extended, like how you would dance with your sister."
00:22:27.095,00:22:29.848,And then you would put your hands on my shoulders as well.
00:22:29.931,00:22:31.433,"Oh, okay."
00:22:32.017,00:22:35.395,Then you just kind of sway back and forth.
00:22:37.814,00:22:39.900,And we're dancing.
00:22:39.983,00:22:41.526,I like three a lot.
00:22:41.610,00:22:43.111,Yeah. See?
00:22:43.195,00:22:47.282,"And I dropped a box of appliances on my foot, so it can't be that hard."
00:22:47.365,00:22:50.911,"Now, Paige is your girlfriend, so you might want to move to two."
00:22:50.994,00:22:51.953,How do I do that?
00:22:52.037,00:22:54.956,"Well, okay, put your arms down."
00:22:56.083,00:23:00.003,Now bend them to a 120-degree angle.
00:23:01.546,00:23:02.380,Yeah.
00:23:02.464,00:23:04.800,And then you just kind of scooch in.
00:23:27.197,00:23:28.115,"Uh, yeah."
00:23:28.198,00:23:32.035,"And, well, one would practically be hugging, so there you have it."
00:23:33.078,00:23:34.788,"I really have to go, Sam."
00:23:34.871,00:23:37.374,Thanks again for your help with the television.
00:23:45.006,00:23:47.259,Sometimes you just know.
00:23:51.638,00:23:54.432,Hey. I just came through the back. The door's open.
00:23:54.516,00:23:56.768,-That's fine. -Cool to park there?
00:23:59.354,00:24:00.480,I'm good.
00:24:01.815,00:24:03.441,Sorry I just left yesterday.
00:24:03.525,00:24:04.776,I had to.
00:24:05.777,00:24:06.903,It's cool. I get it.
00:24:11.908,00:24:15.495,"He sounds lovely. I mean, he must have been if you cared about him so much."
00:24:15.579,00:24:19.166,"Well, I'm just glad you were there..."
00:24:20.584,00:24:22.043,even for a little while.
00:24:25.422,00:24:26.798,"Nick, we have to end this."
00:24:26.882,00:24:27.757,What?
00:24:28.800,00:24:29.634,Why?
00:24:29.718,00:24:34.806,"Because you're not just a distraction or a-a hobby, like bowling."
00:24:35.390,00:24:44.900,"You're a good person, and you deserve to have someone in your life, really in your life, someone that cares about you and can be with you, and that's not me."
00:24:45.650,00:24:46.818,It can't be.
00:24:52.032,00:24:53.200,I'm sorry.
00:24:54.201,00:24:55.827,"Take care of yourself, okay?"
00:24:57.746,00:24:59.206,Take care of myself?
00:24:59.289,00:25:00.457,What the...
00:25:02.375,00:25:05.212,"Hey, Elsa, what are you doing? What happened?"
00:25:05.837,00:25:08.048,"What, did things get too real for you?"
00:25:09.758,00:25:11.635,You're being so selfish. You know that?
00:25:11.718,00:25:13.970,"Oh, good, good. I'm being selfish."
00:25:14.054,00:25:16.473,"Great. For once, something gets to be about me."
00:25:22.395,00:25:24.773,"Look, I'm sorry."
00:25:24.856,00:25:26.274,I liked you.
00:25:26.358,00:25:27.234,It was fun.
00:25:28.068,00:25:31.196,I didn't think you'd get hurt. I wouldn't have done this.
00:25:35.617,00:25:38.286,"Why don't you go camping, go to the mountains?"
00:25:54.344,00:25:56.221,I'm gonna miss you.
00:26:10.777,00:26:12.320,-Hey. -Your sister let me in.
00:26:22.580,00:26:23.832,What's going on?
00:26:29.212,00:26:30.213,Are you getting in?
00:26:35.302,00:26:36.136,Are you sure?
00:26:36.845,00:26:38.430,"Yeah, I'm sure."
00:26:39.055,00:26:39.889,Aren't you?
00:26:39.973,00:26:42.559,"Yeah, yeah. I just, um..."
00:26:48.523,00:26:49.816,"Yeah, me neither."
00:27:19.429,00:27:20.889,"That was really, uh..."
00:27:22.223,00:27:23.308,really...
00:27:25.185,00:27:26.353,Wasn't it?
00:27:31.024,00:27:32.442,"Hey, Casey..."
00:27:34.736,00:27:35.945,I love you.
00:27:55.715,00:27:56.925,Casey?
00:00:07.841,00:00:09.509,"Julia, Julia."
00:00:10.301,00:00:11.469,Julia.
00:00:12.846,00:00:14.180,Julia.
00:00:15.181,00:00:16.599,Julia.
00:00:19.227,00:00:20.061,Julia.
00:00:20.812,00:00:21.771,Julia.
00:00:25.900,00:00:27.193,Julia.
00:00:28.028,00:00:29.362,"Julia, Julia..."
00:00:29.446,00:00:30.280,Julia!
00:00:33.491,00:00:34.492,"What's that, now?"
00:00:36.453,00:00:39.456,It's okay. He blurts things out sometimes. It's normal.
00:00:40.331,00:00:41.708,"Is everything okay, Sam?"
00:00:42.500,00:00:46.921,"Paige, I'm sorry to inform you of this, but I shouldn't be here because I don't love you."
00:00:49.758,00:00:50.592,What?
00:00:50.675,00:00:52.010,I don't love you.
00:00:53.178,00:01:03.396,"I thought I did because you passed a simple checklist test that I devised, but it turns out the simpler test was just knowing, and you failed that one. So I think we should break up."
00:01:07.150,00:01:08.985,It was nice to meet all of you.
00:01:10.487,00:01:17.452,"Oh, and by the way, they actually do have plain pasta with butter, even though it's not on the menu, in case you're not happy with your order."
00:01:17.535,00:01:18.745,It's delicious.
00:01:18.828,00:01:20.538,"See you at school, Paige."
00:01:27.420,00:01:29.339,Those buttered noodles do sound pretty good.
00:01:29.422,00:01:31.341,Shh! Quiet!
00:01:56.950,00:01:58.785,It can be very complicated.
00:02:04.249,00:02:05.667,"Hey, sleepyhead."
00:02:05.750,00:02:09.420,There she is. I was thinking we should celebrate you getting into Clayton.
00:02:09.504,00:02:11.464,"Maybe go out to breakfast, just the two of us."
00:02:12.090,00:02:13.091,Or lunch?
00:02:20.765,00:02:22.058,Sam?
00:02:22.142,00:02:24.811,What are you doing here? We don't have an appointment.
00:02:25.478,00:02:32.277,"I know. But I wanted to tell you something, and I wanted to do it in person because this message involves a gift."
00:02:33.027,00:02:34.028,Okay.
00:02:35.029,00:02:36.239,Julia...
00:02:37.323,00:02:40.827,I've wanted you to be my girlfriend since the day that I gave you my brain.
00:02:40.910,00:02:46.040,But then I learned that you have a boyfriend and about something called a conflict of interest.
00:02:46.124,00:02:52.755,"So on my father's suggestion, I got a practice girlfriend named Paige to prepare for the day when you and I could be together."
00:02:52.839,00:02:54.173,"Okay, Sam, no."
00:02:54.257,00:02:55.925,And now I believe that I'm ready.
00:02:56.009,00:03:02.056,I know how to dance and go to the mall and that it's inappropriate to lock a woman in your closet.
00:03:02.140,00:03:04.893,And I've seen boobs... really nice ones.
00:03:04.976,00:03:06.185,It was so cool.
00:03:18.865,00:03:21.117,Chocolate-covered strawberries?
00:03:27.081,00:03:30.335,did you break into my house with chocolate-covered strawberries?
00:03:30.418,00:03:32.670,"No. Uh, the window was open."
00:03:32.754,00:03:36.633,I just silently climbed in until my dad made me leave.
00:03:37.550,00:03:38.968,"Well, you dropped one."
00:03:40.637,00:03:41.512,Really?
00:03:42.472,00:03:43.806,Oh.
00:03:44.766,00:03:46.476,"You need to leave, Sam."
00:03:47.101,00:03:48.186,Now.
00:03:50.855,00:03:58.404,"Zahid says that you just know when you love someone, which is dumb because it's not based on data or research."
00:03:58.488,00:04:02.825,"But when we were dancing in the parking garage, I just knew."
00:04:02.909,00:04:04.494,Didn't you?
00:04:05.078,00:04:09.374,Are you asking me if I want to start a romantic relationship with my teenage patient?
00:04:09.457,00:04:10.875,Yes. Exactly.
00:04:14.003,00:04:15.964,Say I agree to be your girlfriend.
00:04:16.047,00:04:18.925,"Then what? We start dating, have sex?"
00:04:19.008,00:04:26.474,"I'd lose my job for sleeping with a patient, so I won't have any money to pay my bills or my rent, and I have $200,000 in student loans."
00:04:26.557,00:04:28.476,"Do you have an extra $200,000 lying around?"
00:04:28.559,00:04:29.852,No. Uh...
00:04:30.353,00:04:32.230,I don't know. You're talking really fast.
00:04:32.313,00:04:33.606,Because I'm upset!
00:04:33.690,00:04:36.401,What you did is very inappropriate.
00:04:36.484,00:04:39.070,"You have no sense of that, after all the work we put in?"
00:04:42.573,00:04:44.784,"No. Oh, my God, no!"
00:04:44.867,00:04:45.702,No!
00:04:46.369,00:04:47.704,"God, no!"
00:04:47.787,00:04:48.830,No!
00:04:52.000,00:04:54.085,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:04:54.168,00:04:56.337,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:04:56.421,00:04:58.464,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:04:59.132,00:05:01.092,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:01.175,00:05:03.011,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:03.094,00:05:04.679,"-Uh... -Adélie, chinstrap..."
00:05:04.762,00:05:06.723,I didn't mean to upset you. I wanted to...
00:05:06.806,00:05:10.893,"-You have to understand... -Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:10.977,00:05:12.186,"Sam, I'm so sorry!"
00:05:12.270,00:05:16.399,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:16.482,00:05:18.568,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:21.446,00:05:24.699,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:24.782,00:05:27.410,"-Sam? -Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:29.787,00:05:33.916,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:36.627,00:05:40.798,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:40.882,00:05:44.510,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:44.594,00:05:48.431,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo. Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo."
00:05:48.514,00:05:51.768,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo! Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!"
00:05:51.851,00:05:55.480,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo! Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!"
00:05:55.563,00:05:57.940,"-Hey! -Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!"
00:05:58.024,00:05:59.901,"Adélie, chinstrap, emperor, gentoo!"
00:06:06.115,00:06:07.366,"Oh, thank God."
00:06:07.450,00:06:10.244,-He's up front. -Okay.
00:06:11.537,00:06:12.914,I'm sorry. You know...
00:06:17.251,00:06:18.461,Okay.
00:06:21.839,00:06:23.758,"Shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:06:23.841,00:06:27.553,I always try to drive extra smooth when Sam's on the bus.
00:06:27.637,00:06:30.056,So his back doesn't touch the seat. I did that.
00:06:30.139,00:06:31.724,Don't worry. It's not your fault.
00:06:31.808,00:06:34.435,I appreciate that you were there and appreciate you gave us a call.
00:06:34.519,00:06:36.604,You're welcome. Is there anything I can do?
00:06:36.687,00:06:38.106,-No. -Should I call someone?
00:06:38.189,00:06:40.358,"No, no, no, she's got it. Thank you."
00:06:50.743,00:06:53.538,many of them buried under thick layers of ice.
00:06:54.539,00:06:55.915,Close your eyes.
00:07:01.212,00:07:03.756,the lava creates heated caves.
00:07:04.340,00:07:10.972,"So, even in this landscape of relentless cold, you can find hidden pockets of warmth."
00:07:15.685,00:07:19.730,You warm enough? We can turn up the heat. You need me to turn up the heat?
00:07:34.245,00:07:35.746,-Why would you do that? -Doug.
00:07:35.830,00:07:37.582,-What were you thinking? -I'm sorry.
00:07:37.665,00:07:40.209,Sorry? He let his guard down with you. He trusted you.
00:07:40.293,00:07:45.214,"-I'm sorry. -You know how many people that kid has in his life that treat him like a person, and that's what you do?"
00:07:45.298,00:07:48.593,I'm 27 years old. My life's a mess. I don't know what I'm doing.
00:07:48.676,00:07:50.178,That's a bullshit excuse.
00:07:50.261,00:07:51.345,You crushed him.
00:07:54.557,00:07:57.435,You knew Sam had a crush on me. You enabled those feelings.
00:07:57.518,00:07:59.520,You helped him break into my home. That's on you.
00:08:00.104,00:08:01.314,I know. I'm an idiot.
00:08:01.397,00:08:04.567,That's why I was talking to you. You're supposed to be an expert.
00:08:04.650,00:08:06.611,-Guess what. I don't know anything. -No shit.
00:08:08.321,00:08:10.239,Just stay away from my son.
00:08:19.207,00:08:26.964,"Uh, sorry to just show up, but you weren't really responding to any of my texts, so I thought I'd go old-school and just..."
00:08:27.048,00:08:28.674,track you down in person.
00:08:29.383,00:08:34.347,"Sorry. Sam had a thing, so it's just been kind of hectic around here."
00:08:37.183,00:08:38.559,Really seems hectic.
00:08:39.268,00:08:40.228,Yeah.
00:08:41.854,00:08:42.688,Um...
00:08:42.772,00:08:44.232,Is everything cool?
00:08:45.650,00:08:46.567,Uh-huh.
00:08:46.651,00:08:48.986,"Like, is everything cool with us?"
00:08:49.570,00:08:51.197,Yeah. We're fine.
00:08:51.280,00:08:55.117,"Okay, because if it's about that I love you thing, I take it back."
00:08:56.577,00:08:57.870,I didn't mean it.
00:08:57.954,00:09:03.042,"I just thought that's what, you know, girls like to hear after..."
00:09:03.751,00:09:04.752,you know.
00:09:12.218,00:09:13.719,"-Just go home. -Wait, Casey."
00:09:13.803,00:09:15.221,I said get out!
00:09:28.359,00:09:29.402,But I do.
00:09:29.485,00:09:31.737,-What are you watching? -Frozen Planet.
00:09:34.907,00:09:37.034,This one is about volcanic ice caves.
00:09:37.785,00:09:38.911,Sounds awful.
00:09:47.628,00:09:51.716,"So when you get a snowstorm, it's like soundproofing for the entire planet."
00:09:55.094,00:09:59.599,Sometimes I wish it would snow and just never stop snowing.
00:10:28.294,00:10:31.631,What the hell is this?
00:10:39.639,00:10:40.765,"What up, Shorty?"
00:10:49.690,00:10:51.776,"Ah, the prettiest lady here."
00:10:51.859,00:10:56.155,"Okay, Zahid, good. Headphones. Put them in the garage, please."
00:10:56.739,00:10:58.199,But can't I stay here?
00:10:58.783,00:11:00.076,No. Shoo!
00:11:01.702,00:11:03.037,Enchanté.
00:11:08.459,00:11:11.337,"Hey, Case. Want me to do your hair? I can squeeze you in."
00:11:11.420,00:11:14.882,Why are you even doing this? You know Sam's not going to the dance anymore.
00:11:14.965,00:11:18.886,"Well, whether he goes or not, I made a commitment, and I plan to keep it."
00:11:19.553,00:11:22.515,"Oh, really? I didn't think commitments mattered to you."
00:11:25.101,00:11:25.935,I'll be right back.
00:11:27.269,00:11:38.155,"Honey... I don't know what's going on with you, if you're stressed about changing schools or if it's something else, but you can't keep taking it out on me."
00:11:38.656,00:11:40.032,I haven't done anything.
00:11:41.075,00:11:43.035,Yeah. You're perfect.
00:11:44.245,00:11:45.371,Hey.
00:11:48.582,00:11:50.000,I love you very much.
00:11:51.460,00:11:53.254,"Okay, whatever. I have to go."
00:11:58.843,00:12:02.721,"Code titties. I repeat, code titties. There are a thousand hotties downstairs."
00:12:02.805,00:12:05.641,They're bored. Their standards of entertainment are low.
00:12:05.724,00:12:06.851,We got to get down there.
00:12:06.934,00:12:08.853,"No, thank you. I'm okay here."
00:12:08.936,00:12:12.148,"What's going on, man? Why are you wrapped up like a skinny burrito?"
00:12:13.649,00:12:16.902,There was an incident... on the bus.
00:12:16.986,00:12:18.779,I caused a scene.
00:12:19.613,00:12:21.824,"Oh. Dude, I'm sorry."
00:12:21.907,00:12:24.285,"You know what might make you feel better, though?"
00:12:24.368,00:12:27.079,Like a thousand nice asses in those fleecy sweatpants.
00:12:27.163,00:12:28.080,Or nachos.
00:12:28.164,00:12:31.083,"No, melty cheese makes my mouth feel funny."
00:12:31.167,00:12:32.334,And I'm done with girls.
00:12:32.418,00:12:33.669,They're too...
00:12:36.380,00:12:38.090,Did something happen with Paige?
00:12:38.799,00:12:39.800,Not Paige.
00:12:40.509,00:12:41.635,Julia.
00:12:41.719,00:12:44.388,"All right, I'm calling bullshit on this Julia."
00:12:44.472,00:12:50.394,"She dresses like a homeless lady, and she has horrible taste in televisions. I thought you were in love with Paige."
00:12:50.978,00:12:52.688,"I thought so, too, but then..."
00:12:54.940,00:12:57.985,"With Julia, it was like you said."
00:12:58.736,00:13:00.237,I just knew.
00:13:00.321,00:13:04.575,But then when I-I told her how I felt...
00:13:09.038,00:13:11.457,"I'm sorry, man. Chicks are the worst."
00:13:11.957,00:13:14.126,"Now, let's go meet a whole bunch of them."
00:13:18.088,00:13:26.555,"Since you thought it would be appropriate to take a giant dump on my heart, I thought it would be appropriate to dump all of your stuff!"
00:13:27.223,00:13:28.432,Honey!
00:13:28.516,00:13:30.017,We got a situation!
00:13:34.522,00:13:39.318,"Here's the drawing of the Antarctic krill, which I obviously don't need for my locker anymore!"
00:13:40.069,00:13:43.697,Here's the detention slip that we got after our first kiss in French class.
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.450,She seems mad.
00:13:46.534,00:13:48.202,"Yeah, she is."
00:13:48.285,00:13:51.247,But you know what's not in here? My virginity!
00:13:52.164,00:13:54.291,"Yeah! Which you were gonna get, by the way."
00:13:54.375,00:13:55.918,But now you're not.
00:13:56.752,00:14:00.089,I'll probably do it with the first guy in college with a British accent.
00:14:00.172,00:14:01.840,So thanks for that!
00:14:02.550,00:14:04.134,You know what else isn't in there?
00:14:04.218,00:14:10.349,"The penguin necklace you got me. I lost it, at some point, last Tuesday, and I really, really miss it."
00:14:10.432,00:14:14.144,And I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
00:14:15.896,00:14:17.982,But now I do!
00:14:20.109,00:14:22.152,"Jeez, dude, what did you do to her?"
00:14:22.862,00:14:24.822,I don't know. I just told her the truth.
00:14:24.905,00:14:27.741,"I think you broke her heart, Sam."
00:14:31.453,00:14:33.330,but that's not true.
00:14:34.582,00:14:40.087,"Sometimes I can't tell if someone's upset, but once I know, I feel lots of empathy."
00:14:40.963,00:14:43.632,Maybe even more than neurotypicals.
00:14:45.050,00:14:47.219,"This was gonna be your Christmas present, Sam."
00:14:47.761,00:14:48.888,Isn't it so cute?
00:14:48.971,00:14:51.056,"-You would have loved that, dude. -Yep."
00:14:51.140,00:14:52.266,"Well, guess what."
00:14:58.564,00:14:59.982,Suck on that.
00:15:02.443,00:15:04.486,Paige is here? Does she want her hair done?
00:15:04.570,00:15:05.404,I don't think so.
00:15:07.907,00:15:09.783,I think I need to apologize to Paige.
00:15:10.826,00:15:13.495,"It's gonna need to be a pretty big apology, bro."
00:15:30.304,00:15:31.513,I'll have a gin and tonic.
00:15:32.765,00:15:35.142,"You know there's no way that's happening, right?"
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.436,Do you want to see my ID?
00:15:37.519,00:15:40.272,Not really. You're clearly not 21.
00:15:40.356,00:15:42.107,"Trust me, you want to see my ID."
00:15:52.743,00:15:53.953,Casey.
00:15:56.080,00:15:57.122,Yeah.
00:16:02.044,00:16:02.878,Shit.
00:16:04.546,00:16:06.632,I'll take that gin and tonic now.
00:16:18.018,00:16:20.771,Lime and soda. Best I can do.
00:16:23.649,00:16:26.694,I saw you guys... you and my mom.
00:16:28.529,00:16:30.239,-Have you talked to her? -No.
00:16:30.322,00:16:31.824,It's over. It ended.
00:16:31.907,00:16:33.367,That's bullshit.
00:16:33.450,00:16:35.285,"No, I'm serious. She ended things with me."
00:16:36.537,00:16:37.371,Why?
00:16:39.915,00:16:41.583,Because of you...
00:16:41.667,00:16:43.002,her family.
00:16:44.920,00:16:48.132,"If she cared about us, she wouldn't have done it in the first place."
00:16:49.258,00:16:52.511,"I don't know about that, but I don't think it's so simple."
00:16:52.594,00:16:55.514,"-What the hell do you know? -Not much, really."
00:16:58.892,00:17:02.021,"Us two? There's three of us? There's me, my brother and my dad."
00:17:02.104,00:17:04.189,"I know, I meant three."
00:17:14.950,00:17:16.201,Why did she do it?
00:17:17.786,00:17:19.580,I-I don't know.
00:17:21.498,00:17:23.584,I think your mom has spent...
00:17:25.127,00:17:27.838,a really long time sort of stuck in a role.
00:17:31.800,00:17:34.428,"but there's more to her than just being a mom, you know?"
00:17:41.310,00:17:42.436,Wow.
00:17:44.396,00:17:46.356,"That is super deep, dude."
00:17:56.033,00:17:57.701,Here's what we're gonna do.
00:17:59.161,00:18:01.789,I made Paige feel the way Julia made me feel...
00:18:02.372,00:18:04.124,which is very bad.
00:18:06.126,00:18:11.381,So I'm gonna make it up to her by finding her missing necklace and presenting it to her at the silent dance.
00:18:11.465,00:18:14.259,"Yeah, dude! You look like a million bucks!"
00:18:14.343,00:18:18.639,"Well, the tux rental was only $99, so that's a really good return."
00:18:18.722,00:18:21.892,"I'll trust you on the math. Now look over here, Double-O Penguin."
00:18:24.478,00:18:26.146,"Oh, honey, look!"
00:18:27.564,00:18:30.984,-How does Zahid have your phone number? -I gave it to him in case of emergencies.
00:18:31.068,00:18:33.654,But he uses it to send me selfies when he's bored.
00:18:33.737,00:18:34.696,Look at this guy.
00:18:35.531,00:18:37.032,He looks great.
00:18:37.116,00:18:39.576,You ever think we'd make it to a school dance?
00:18:42.579,00:18:44.123,"-I know. -Really, really good."
00:18:44.206,00:18:46.250,I know. It was a tough day.
00:18:46.333,00:18:47.960,You know what?
00:18:48.043,00:18:49.586,-What? -You were right.
00:18:50.420,00:18:53.632,You were right to push him. You've been great with him lately.
00:18:53.715,00:18:59.388,"He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him."
00:19:02.724,00:19:04.601,"You know, I knew about Julia."
00:19:05.519,00:19:08.313,"Yeah, we both did. I mean, he was overly dependent on her."
00:19:08.397,00:19:11.900,"No, I knew... how he felt about her."
00:19:16.196,00:19:17.823,And I know I should have.
00:19:19.283,00:19:23.162,"But, you know, it's always been... the two of you."
00:19:23.245,00:19:25.414,"It's always been you and Sam, and..."
00:19:26.415,00:19:29.126,"You know, he started talking to me and..."
00:19:34.715,00:19:35.716,Yeah.
00:19:37.467,00:19:39.761,Do you know why it's always been me and Sam?
00:19:40.762,00:19:41.805,Because you left.
00:19:41.889,00:19:44.641,"But I'm here now, and I'm not going anywhere."
00:19:44.725,00:19:46.268,I know.
00:19:46.351,00:19:47.561,But...
00:19:48.896,00:19:53.775,imagine having a young child that was just diagnosed...
00:19:54.610,00:19:56.111,and a toddler.
00:19:57.529,00:20:06.205,And the person that you love most in the world and the person you trust splits.
00:20:07.289,00:20:11.501,"So, yeah, I kept Sam separate and safe."
00:20:13.462,00:20:16.882,Because I didn't know if you were gonna leave again.
00:20:20.636,00:20:22.596,"-Honey, I... -It was wrong."
00:20:22.679,00:20:26.558,"I've been so angry, and I've been holding it over you for so long."
00:20:26.642,00:20:29.561,And I'm done. I'm done doing that.
00:20:32.522,00:20:34.316,He needs you. I need you.
00:20:34.399,00:20:35.484,And...
00:20:36.235,00:20:37.736,I'm sorry.
00:20:38.820,00:20:40.197,You don't have to say sorry.
00:20:44.576,00:20:45.827,for both of us?
00:20:47.621,00:20:48.664,Clean slate.
00:20:57.422,00:20:58.674,I love you.
00:20:58.757,00:21:00.342,"I love you, too."
00:21:01.843,00:21:03.470,You built a really nice igloo.
00:21:04.388,00:21:05.389,It is a nice igloo.
00:21:08.558,00:21:12.229,All right. I need to find some kids to bring this igloo in that school.
00:21:13.647,00:21:17.651,I don't want Paige to have a breakdown. She's hanging on by a thread already.
00:21:39.006,00:21:40.465,What's wrong with you?
00:21:40.549,00:21:42.175,Did you get into a fight with Evan?
00:21:42.259,00:21:43.385,No.
00:21:43.468,00:21:44.594,Maybe.
00:21:44.678,00:21:46.471,Have a great time.
00:21:47.556,00:21:51.268,"Oh, girls! Look how great you all look. So beautiful."
00:21:51.351,00:21:53.854,Did you see Christopher? Look how sharp he is.
00:21:53.937,00:21:55.605,I want to leave.
00:21:56.565,00:21:59.735,"Here you go. You guys, go ahead and go in there. We'll be in soon."
00:21:59.818,00:22:05.324,Then we can all shake our booties toget-- Teenage girls are assholes.
00:22:06.575,00:22:08.618,"Oh, what? Like you don't know it?"
00:22:46.740,00:22:47.866,Wow.
00:22:47.949,00:22:48.992,I know.
00:22:49.076,00:22:51.578,Aw! My garlands look so pretty.
00:22:51.661,00:22:54.998,"I made every snowflake uniquely different, just like real-life nature does."
00:22:55.123,00:22:56.083,Casey!
00:22:57.834,00:22:59.836,-Dad! -Look at you! You look fantastic!
00:23:00.670,00:23:02.130,-You look so good. -Thank you.
00:23:02.214,00:23:04.966,Did you see the igloo? I made this igloo. You like this?
00:23:05.717,00:23:07.511,"-Pretty good, right? -It's amazing."
00:23:10.806,00:23:16.186,"-Oh, my God. -I'm gonna go stand by it and make sure no bozos spill punch on it. Okay, you girls, you look magical."
00:23:16.269,00:23:17.729,"All right, have a great night."
00:23:17.813,00:23:18.980,-Okay. -Have fun.
00:23:48.343,00:23:53.932,"Okay, Paige lost her necklace sometime on Tuesday, so if I can retrace her steps, I should be able to find it."
00:23:54.015,00:23:56.518,"Fortunately, I have her whole schedule memorized."
00:23:56.601,00:23:58.645,"Stalkery, but also kind of sweet."
00:24:00.564,00:24:02.232,"First period, chemistry."
00:24:02.315,00:24:03.150,It's not here.
00:24:03.233,00:24:06.361,"Well, you think you have it bad? I'm dead."
00:24:07.028,00:24:10.073,"Now, come kiss Skelly on the phalanges."
00:24:10.157,00:24:10.991,Let's go.
00:24:11.074,00:24:12.701,Third period... French.
00:24:12.784,00:24:14.119,It's not in here.
00:24:14.202,00:24:16.204,French chicks are hot!
00:24:16.872,00:24:19.833,I got to get over there so I can tap that poutine.
00:24:19.916,00:24:20.834,Let's go.
00:24:20.917,00:24:22.627,Sixth period... history.
00:24:22.711,00:24:23.962,It's not in here.
00:24:24.045,00:24:26.423,Did you know that George Washington smoked dope?
00:24:26.506,00:24:28.466,They called him Ganja George.
00:24:28.550,00:24:31.386,Of course you didn't know. They don't teach that shit in school.
00:24:32.137,00:24:32.971,Let's go.
00:24:34.222,00:24:35.265,There you go.
00:24:36.391,00:24:38.935,Spent a summer with my cousin who jacks cars.
00:24:39.019,00:24:40.270,It was sad.
00:24:41.146,00:24:44.733,"It's not in here, either. How have we not found it yet?"
00:24:46.735,00:24:47.611,"Oh, no."
00:24:47.694,00:24:48.695,What?
00:24:49.738,00:24:51.781,I hope she didn't lose it in eighth period.
00:24:51.865,00:24:53.408,"Why, what's eighth period?"
00:25:00.165,00:25:02.459,to promote the conservation of the Ross Sea.
00:25:03.126,00:25:04.294,There it is.
00:25:06.171,00:25:10.550,"Because of his efforts, it's now the largest protected marine area in the world."
00:25:10.634,00:25:13.428,I don't like getting in water that people have touched.
00:25:13.511,00:25:15.347,"Oh, people do much worse than that."
00:25:19.184,00:25:20.310,-That's not helpful. -No.
00:25:21.478,00:25:22.812,You want me to get it for you?
00:25:31.279,00:25:33.198,"No, thank you, Zahid."
00:25:33.281,00:25:36.868,The hero must complete his or her own mission of redemption.
00:25:43.667,00:25:47.003,"Okay, see, no, no. Only three-quarters of a cup per person."
00:25:47.087,00:25:49.130,We're not made of punch.
00:25:57.639,00:25:58.807,I found this.
00:26:03.353,00:26:05.647,What-- how? Why?
00:26:05.730,00:26:09.401,How is I retraced your steps on Tuesday and found it in the pool.
00:26:09.484,00:26:14.447,"And why is that I feel bad for breaking your heart, so this is my apology."
00:26:14.531,00:26:15.949,Do you forgive me?
00:26:16.992,00:26:18.868,Meet me in the igloo in two minutes.
00:26:25.792,00:26:27.335,"Hey, dance with me."
00:26:30.005,00:26:31.631,-Shut up. -Okay.
00:26:31.715,00:26:32.924,Here.
00:26:33.425,00:26:35.385,Ew! Why are you wet?
00:26:35.468,00:26:37.971,You know what? Never mind. I don't care. Just...
00:26:43.435,00:26:44.436,What?
00:26:44.519,00:26:51.109,"I mean, like, Sam, if you need me or whatever, I can turn the scholarship down."
00:26:52.110,00:26:53.194,That would be dumb.
00:26:55.196,00:26:59.409,Well... like what if something happens like yesterday and I'm not there?
00:27:00.744,00:27:05.999,"I know you think you have to protect me, but I have Mom and Dad and lots of other people. You can go."
00:27:07.751,00:27:10.462,"Well, what if you didn't have Mom and Dad?"
00:27:10.545,00:27:13.381,"Like, what if they weren't together?"
00:27:13.465,00:27:16.634,"Like, if Dad was at work? I guess I'd wait for him to come home."
00:27:17.927,00:27:20.388,It's definitely been two minutes. I have to go.
00:27:39.866,00:27:41.242,Hi.
00:27:41.326,00:27:42.702,Can you come get me?
00:27:45.955,00:27:47.791,Way better than his last one.
00:27:51.086,00:27:54.798,"So what's going on here, Sam?"
00:27:54.881,00:27:58.385,"I mean, you show up with my necklace and soaking wet."
00:27:58.468,00:28:02.097,"I mean, what do you want? Do you want to get back together?"
00:28:03.973,00:28:09.437,"I want to try to explain, but I might have to talk about animals, and I know that annoys you sometimes."
00:28:10.939,00:28:12.899,-Go ahead. -Okay.
00:28:13.483,00:28:15.151,"In nature, it's simple."
00:28:15.902,00:28:23.243,"Animals are drawn to mate with an appropriate specimen, and they spread their wings or show their colorful rump and mate."
00:28:24.077,00:28:25.453,That makes sense.
00:28:26.162,00:28:29.999,They don't have love. They don't have hurt feelings.
00:28:30.667,00:28:32.377,They don't have dances.
00:28:37.507,00:28:41.678,"Okay, I'm sorry to be short, but I have a lot of people counting on me out there."
00:28:41.761,00:28:43.304,"So, what's the point?"
00:28:48.893,00:28:53.231,"I wanted to make all this girlfriend stuff simple, but it's not simple."
00:28:55.024,00:28:56.901,I don't know if I love you.
00:28:56.985,00:28:59.154,I don't know who I love anymore.
00:29:00.029,00:29:06.786,"But you're funny and pretty, and I like the way you pinch your nose when you sneeze."
00:29:07.996,00:29:10.999,"And I'm really, really sorry I hurt your feelings."
00:29:15.044,00:29:16.171,Okay.
00:29:16.838,00:29:18.840,I appreciate your honesty.
00:29:20.842,00:29:24.304,But you didn't appreciate it at the Olive Garden.
00:29:25.013,00:29:27.182,Because that was in front of my whole family.
00:29:28.349,00:29:30.518,Got it. That's the difference.
00:29:34.606,00:29:39.944,Well... I don't think we should be boyfriend and girlfriend again until you're sure of what you want.
00:29:40.862,00:29:41.821,Okay.
00:29:43.823,00:29:46.326,But that doesn't mean we can't mess around a little.
00:30:03.551,00:30:04.677,You okay?
00:30:07.180,00:30:08.723,My mom had an affair.
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.438,"Here, come here."
00:30:22.403,00:30:23.613,I knew she was a dick.
00:30:23.696,00:30:26.032,I just didn't know she was that big of a dick.
00:30:29.994,00:30:31.871,Sorry I was so weird to you.
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.541,"No, it's, um..."
00:30:35.500,00:30:36.668,it's okay.
00:30:37.377,00:30:38.670,"I was, uh..."
00:30:39.838,00:30:40.922,an idiot.
00:30:41.673,00:30:47.262,"And when you didn't say that you loved me back, I just... I felt like a tool."
00:30:48.346,00:30:53.101,But I really don't care whether you say it or not.
00:30:53.184,00:30:56.938,"I love you, and... and that's that."
00:30:59.440,00:31:00.441,Yeah?
00:31:01.276,00:31:02.443,Yeah.
00:31:04.153,00:31:07.991,"And I should have been more mature, so, um, how about this?"
00:31:08.074,00:31:10.076,I'll race you to the top of those steps.
00:31:10.159,00:31:12.662,"And if I win, then you have to love me back."
00:31:13.496,00:31:14.581,That sounds fair.
00:31:14.664,00:31:16.040,-Doesn't it? -Mm-hmm.
00:31:17.667,00:31:18.501,Go!
00:31:30.179,00:31:31.264,Oh.
00:31:36.144,00:31:37.770,I totally love you.
00:31:48.740,00:31:51.034,"Hey, Doug. Having fun?"
00:31:51.117,00:31:52.869,"Hey, guys. Sure. You?"
00:31:52.952,00:31:56.456,"Well, let's just put it this way, I'm glad I brought comic books."
00:31:57.332,00:31:59.834,"Uh, Luisa, I'm sorry to hear about your cousin."
00:31:59.918,00:32:01.836,-My cousin? -Who died.
00:32:01.920,00:32:03.463,Elsa was at the memorial.
00:32:04.839,00:32:06.841,"Oh, right... my cousin."
00:32:06.925,00:32:07.926,Uh...
00:32:08.009,00:32:09.844,"We weren't super close, so I don't..."
00:32:09.928,00:32:12.639,"I don't, uh, think about it a lot."
00:32:12.722,00:32:14.015,What? Who died?
00:32:14.098,00:32:15.934,What's he talking about?
00:32:16.434,00:32:20.146,"Honey, you have to try the photo booth. They have the cutest props."
00:32:20.229,00:32:22.148,-Look at this hat. -Hmm.
00:32:24.484,00:32:26.194,I just got a hand job in an igloo.
00:32:27.403,00:32:29.322,"Dude, awesome!"
00:32:46.172,00:32:52.595,"As Antarctic winter descends the ice continues to grow, effectively doubling the size of the continent."
00:32:52.679,00:32:54.263,Doubling it!
00:33:04.983,00:33:07.568,It has presence. It takes up space.
00:33:08.403,00:33:11.406,Miles? What are you doing here?
00:33:11.990,00:33:13.116,Hey.
00:33:13.908,00:33:15.743,I got your messages.
00:33:16.744,00:33:17.954,Julia...
00:33:25.920,00:33:26.921,You win.
00:33:28.423,00:33:29.674,Let's get married.
00:33:32.593,00:33:34.512,I-- I win?
00:33:40.601,00:33:45.898,"when penguins make even the smallest movement together, they create a unique behavioral warming structure."
00:33:45.982,00:33:49.569,So emperor penguins perform a mass dance to keep warm.
00:34:08.671,00:34:09.714,Dad?
00:34:10.423,00:34:12.091,It's a really good igloo.
00:34:18.514,00:34:21.100,That's the first time you ever hugged me on your own.
00:34:22.351,00:34:23.478,Oh.
00:34:34.030,00:34:37.366,So does your mom know that you know?
00:34:37.450,00:34:38.451,No.
00:34:39.035,00:34:40.745,I've just been a total jerk to her.
00:34:41.496,00:34:45.166,I even left a passive-aggressive note on her stupid to-do board.
00:34:46.542,00:34:49.879,One penguin couldn't warm up like that on its own.
00:34:49.962,00:34:51.631,They do it by being together.
00:34:51.714,00:34:53.841,"Why would she write that on there, huh?"
00:34:59.889,00:35:02.225,"It's weird that she would write that, isn't it?"
