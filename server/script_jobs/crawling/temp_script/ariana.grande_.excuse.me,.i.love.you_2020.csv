00:05:45.136,00:05:46.846,It's sold-out here. I think. I think it is.
00:05:48.765,00:05:52.018,"-Yes. -I'm proud of Ariana, the dancers, I'm proud of myself, and my brother."
00:05:52.101,00:05:54.062,"The kids are gonna love the whole, entire show."
00:05:54.145,00:05:57.357,"Especially the way Ariana's dancing, singing, the visuals, everything."
00:05:57.440,00:05:58.441,It's gonna be sick.
00:05:59.359,00:06:00.985,"I'm really-- I'm gonna cry, so stop."
00:06:01.486,00:06:02.695,"Um, I'm excited."

00:06:20.421,00:06:23.299,"I mean, literally, I told her, There's no words that describe it."
00:06:23.383,00:06:29.305,To think where she was six to eight months ago and think she's going to be on that stage tonight doing what she does best.
00:06:29.389,00:06:32.475,"First show. Albany, New York. Let's get it."
00:06:33.059,00:06:35.686,"Nervous, excited, so happy to be here."
00:06:35.770,00:06:38.648,"Feeling ready, feelin' fresh, ready to go. You know what I'm saying?"
00:06:38.731,00:06:39.941,Ready to get it or whatever.
00:06:40.024,00:06:43.444,"-Hey, hey, hey. That's my song. -Yeah, ready as shit."

00:07:05.258,00:07:07.218,"Opening night. How you feeling, man?"
00:07:07.301,00:07:10.805,"Feeling good, but I thought this was a photo, so this is awkward."
00:07:10.888,00:07:11.722,You know.
00:07:18.104,00:07:21.315,"Today, I am grateful for love and friendship."
00:07:21.399,00:07:22.942,Family that has just been created.
00:07:23.025,00:07:24.318,And the memories that we shared.
00:07:24.402,00:07:25.736,"New family, new friends."
00:07:25.820,00:07:28.573,"That appreciates each other, that loves each other, pushes each other."
00:07:28.656,00:07:30.658,"We had the courage to, kind of, follow our dreams."
00:07:30.741,00:07:31.659,Thank God every day.
00:07:31.742,00:07:34.078,To be a part of something bigger than me.
00:07:34.162,00:07:36.164,All the good energy that you guys bring.
00:07:36.247,00:07:39.750,Never settling and to be inspired by each and every one of y'all. For real.

00:14:27.783,00:14:28.617,Let's go.
00:15:03.736,00:15:05.738,"He's like, everyone's running around screaming."
00:15:05.821,00:15:07.781,It smells like fucking poison.
00:15:07.865,00:15:17.708,"It's horrible. The whole room is smelly, and Diane walks in, and she steps on the shit and tracks it everywhere. So now there's shit everywhere, and Fredo's like, Oh my God, it smells so bad."
00:15:17.791,00:15:19.668,He goes over to open the window.
00:15:19.752,00:15:21.003,Piggy shits on the bed.
00:15:22.796,00:15:27.134,Myron jumps up on the bed and eats Piggy's shit.
00:15:27.217,00:15:31.055,"I'm, like, picking up Piggy's shit as Myron's trying to eat it, and throw it in the toilet."
00:15:31.138,00:15:36.435,"I see Fredo running towards me in the bathroom and-- He's very sensitive in that department, so I already know what's coming."
00:15:36.518,00:15:38.062,He runs in and starts throwing up.
00:15:38.145,00:15:40.856,"I start crying my eyes out, running, screaming out of the room."
00:15:40.940,00:15:43.150,"Kristin Chenoweth's still on FaceTime, might I add."
00:15:43.233,00:15:45.569,"Josh is on the ground, crying his eyes out laughing."
00:15:45.653,00:15:47.321,This lasted 15 minutes.
00:16:01.085,00:16:02.169,I'd love a spoon.
00:16:02.252,00:16:04.338,It's by the soup. It's by the soup. Sitting there.
00:16:09.009,00:16:10.970,-Promise you'll be on the next one? -Yeah.
00:16:11.053,00:16:12.972,Okay. What if you have another tour?
00:16:13.055,00:16:14.348,I'll be-- I'll cancel on 'em.
00:16:27.152,00:16:28.821,Right in the inner part.
00:16:31.156,00:16:33.742,With this glue that's not gonna come off till you're six feet under.
00:16:35.911,00:16:38.330,It really doesn't. I swear to God.
00:16:38.414,00:16:41.291,You should see me with my coconut oil crying and bleeding.
00:19:42.639,00:19:45.392,"You think just because I'm a movie star, I don't have feelings."
00:19:45.475,00:19:48.145,"Well, you're wrong. I do have feelings."
00:19:48.228,00:19:50.939,I'm an actress. I have all of them.

00:31:04.946,00:31:08.867,"It says, I want it. I got it."
00:31:11.911,00:31:13.288,That's nice.
00:31:14.330,00:31:17.709,"That's a nice saying, huh? It's a manifestation."
00:31:18.459,00:31:21.796,"It sounds familiar, huh? London, do y'all know this song?"
00:31:24.924,00:31:26.718,What about y'all over here? You know this song?
00:31:27.427,00:31:28.720,Y'all know this one.
00:31:33.391,00:31:36.269,We need y'all to sing every word as loud as you can. Are y'all ready?

00:35:41.597,00:35:45.768,"What's the easiest way elevator-wise to get to the top levels, like the 200s?"
00:35:45.852,00:35:48.062,We're giving some tickets to some kids in the nosebleeds.
00:35:48.146,00:35:50.314,-I'm Melissa. Nice to meet you. -Scott. Nice to meet you.
00:35:50.398,00:35:53.025,We have a criteria. We like a single parent with their kid.

00:36:02.243,00:36:03.202,Tons of merch.
00:36:03.286,00:36:05.413,Drag queens. Drag queens are really good.
00:36:06.330,00:36:09.834,I'm just scanning to see the people all the way up top.
00:36:09.917,00:36:10.835,Just y'all three?

00:36:30.938,00:36:33.524,Oh! Who's crying? Find out.
00:36:33.608,00:36:36.944,"Yeah, it's because the level is a little high, so she feels scared."
00:36:44.368,00:36:47.330,"Tell me why you're crying, 'cause I hate when I see people cry."
00:36:47.830,00:36:49.165,It's too high up.
00:36:49.248,00:36:52.627,It is. How would you like to go down to the bottom with us?
00:36:52.710,00:36:55.338,I'll go get your sister. I have my daughter up there.
00:36:58.799,00:36:59.634,Thank you.
00:36:59.717,00:37:01.677,You're welcome. Don't be sad.
00:37:01.761,00:37:04.722,-Bye. Take care. Have a great time. -Thank you.
00:37:10.561,00:37:15.399,"So, if we do Monopoly tonight, I'll cut Successful so there's room."
00:37:53.437,00:37:54.855,Where are the twins?
00:37:54.939,00:37:56.107,Where are the twins?
00:37:57.441,00:37:59.026,"-It's, um, back that way. -Okay."

01:02:03.094,01:02:06.055,"-Right now? -We still have to go to trial, but yeah."
01:02:06.889,01:02:08.182,When's the trial?
01:02:08.266,01:02:09.892,Trump is impeached.
01:02:23.865,01:02:25.867,"-Trump was impeached! -Oh, yeah. I heard."
01:02:40.089,01:02:42.216,Just wanted to remind you about the Mariah thing.
01:02:42.300,01:02:44.927,All you gotta do is put it on and dance around.
01:02:45.011,01:02:48.556,-Does that mean she likes me? -She actually likes you a lot.
01:02:48.639,01:02:56.522,"Mariah is doing a video for All I Want for Christmas is You, and it's, like, a compilation of some of her favorite artists right now."
01:02:57.106,01:03:02.612,"That's what they said anyway to me, and she asked me to be one of them."
01:03:03.154,01:03:10.453,"And apparently, the request came directly from her, so I don't know how to feel right now."
01:03:13.748,01:03:17.001,"-I'm gonna do right now. Okay. -All right, love you. Bye."
01:03:17.835,01:03:19.504,-Scott! -Yeah?
01:03:19.587,01:03:20.546,Come here.
01:03:20.630,01:03:22.507,We have to film something for Mariah.
01:03:23.841,01:03:25.051,Done.
01:03:25.134,01:03:27.136,"-Can you put the song on? -Yeah, I gotchu."
01:03:31.849,01:03:40.107,"I learned to sing by mimicking her and Beyoncé and Whitney, and that's how I learned to do runs. Listening and being like, Oh, shit."
01:03:40.191,01:03:41.234,Can I do that?
01:03:53.454,01:04:01.087,It just means a lot to hear from her because my sound was so influenced by her and like the '90s pop sound.
01:04:01.170,01:04:06.968,"The fact that she thought of me is, like, very soul-shaking. You know what I mean?"
01:04:07.051,01:04:09.804,It just means a lot as an artist and as a fan.
01:04:22.483,01:04:24.777,…literally her stage mom.
01:04:25.862,01:04:27.905,Copying everything she's doing in the corner.
01:04:27.989,01:04:29.156,"I'm like, keep going."
01:04:29.907,01:04:32.285,I love that. You smashed that.
01:04:35.204,01:04:36.664,-What up? -Hi.
01:04:36.747,01:04:38.374,-How are you? -It's almost over.
01:04:38.457,01:04:39.375,I know.
01:04:44.005,01:04:45.756,"-I'm sending it to her now. -Okay, I'm crying."
01:04:45.840,01:04:47.174,-Will you let me know? -Yep. Bye.
01:04:59.312,01:05:02.523,"London, how y'all feeling? I missed y'all when I was gone."
01:05:04.358,01:05:06.068,Y'all ready to sing? Come on.
01:05:06.152,01:05:07.069,Let me hear you.

01:11:51.056,01:11:52.474,"London, I wanna see y'all jump."
01:11:52.558,01:11:53.517,Let's go.
01:12:27.509,01:12:30.012,It's fucked up.
01:12:34.767,01:12:36.393,"Everything's black. The mom and dad are coming, too?"
01:12:37.519,01:12:38.354,Yeah.
01:12:46.236,01:12:49.031,It's not like big bang scary. So pay attention.
01:12:49.114,01:12:50.074,Cheers.

01:13:28.821,01:13:46.505,"I just really love you guys, and I'm very grateful and I know that it was a lot, and I know that it's been hard physically and mentally, but like, this show for sure, for sure, for sure saved my life this year."
01:13:47.089,01:13:59.268,I just wanted to say how grateful I am for you guys and for this experience and for your time and your energy and for-- Oh my God. I just inhaled a tear.
01:14:02.646,01:14:09.528,"I have to say the professionalism and the kindness and the energy, it's just unmatched."
01:14:11.155,01:14:13.449,"-Love you, guys. -Love you so much."
01:16:36.592,01:16:37.718,"Let's go, Nelson."
01:16:37.801,01:16:38.719,Hey.
01:16:54.401,01:16:55.777,"Fuck it up, Nelson!"
01:17:40.197,01:17:44.660,"London, I want y'all to make some noise for my incredible band."

01:21:09.948,01:21:13.994,I wanted to take a moment to say how grateful I am for all of you guys.
01:21:14.077,01:21:22.669,"We've done, I don't even know how many, but I don't know, like a million shows, and they've all been incredible, every single one."
01:21:22.752,01:21:31.261,"And I just wanted to thank you so much for taking the time to come to all the shows, even flying around and sharing rooms together."
