00:00:11.679,00:00:20.771,"Despite his meandering maneuverability, his strategical susceptibility, his infantile indefatigability And his tendency towards tantrum capability, he still remains-- An imaginary sound of music."
00:00:28.236,00:00:30.698,A-an imaginary sound of music.
00:00:30.739,00:00:36.704,"Ever had one of those nights that starts out like any other, but ends up being the best night of your life?"
00:00:36.745,00:00:39.289,Are you sitting comfortably?
00:00:39.331,00:00:40.875,Then we'll begin.
00:00:40.916,00:00:46.338,"It was June the 22nd, 1990, our final day of school."
00:00:46.380,00:00:52.219,"There was Oliver Chamberlain, Peter Page, Steven Prince, Andy Knightley and me."
00:00:52.260,00:00:54.179,They called me the King.
00:00:54.221,00:00:57.016,Because my name's Gary King.
00:00:57.057,00:00:59.059,Ollie was funny.
00:00:59.100,00:01:01.854,"He fancied himself as a bit of a player, but really he was all mouth."
00:01:01.896,00:01:05.900,We called him O-Man because he had a birthmark on his fore- head that looked like a six.
00:01:05.941,00:01:08.360,He loved it.
00:01:08.402,00:01:10.445,Pete was the baby of the group.
00:01:10.487,00:01:14.033,"He wasn't the kind of kid we'd usually hang out with, but he was good for a laugh."
00:01:14.074,00:01:16.618,And he was absolutely minted.
00:01:18.078,00:01:20.205,Steve was a pretty cool guy.
00:01:20.247,00:01:22.708,"We jammed together, chased the girls."
00:01:22.750,00:01:24.376,I think he saw us as rivals.
00:01:24.418,00:01:25.878,"Sweet, really."
00:01:25.920,00:01:27.588,And Andy.
00:01:27.629,00:01:31.341,"Andy was my wingman, the one guy I could rely on to back me up."
00:01:31.383,00:01:35.596,"He loved me, and I'm not being funny, but I loved him too."
00:01:35.637,00:01:38.891,-There was nothing we were gonna miss about school.
00:01:38.933,00:01:41.894,maybe Mr. Shepherd.
00:01:41.936,00:01:44.563,He used to ask me what I wanted to do with my life.
00:01:44.605,00:01:48.525,I told him I just wanted to have a good time.
00:01:48.567,00:01:50.861,It wasn't meant to be.
00:01:50.903,00:01:52.905,Come on! Once more!
00:01:52.947,00:01:57.409,"Newton Haven was our hometown, our playground, our universe."
00:01:57.451,00:02:00.579,"And that night, it was the site of a heroic quest."
00:02:00.621,00:02:07.586,"The aim-- to conquer The Golden Mile, 12 pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic indulgence."
00:02:07.628,00:02:21.058,"There was the first post, the old familiar, the famous cock, the cross hands, the good companions, the trusty servant, the two headed dog, the mermaid, the beehive, the King's head, the hole in the wall, all before reaching our destiny, the world's end."
00:02:21.100,00:02:25.771,We took my car into town.
00:02:25.813,00:02:28.607,-And so our journey into manhood began.
00:02:28.649,00:02:31.735,We were off.
00:02:31.777,00:02:33.779,"We hit pub one, and we hit it hard."
00:02:33.821,00:02:42.871,"There was drinking, there was fun, there was controversy, there were ladies, there were shots, there was drama, and of course there was drinking."
00:02:45.165,00:02:52.756,"By pub five, we were feeling invincible And decided to purchase some herbal refreshment from a man we called The reverend green."
00:02:52.798,00:02:55.968,"Pint six put O-Man out of commission, so we carried on without him."
00:02:56.010,00:02:58.303,Good thing.
00:02:58.345,00:03:01.473,"We went into the disabled's, and I bumped into her again."
00:03:01.515,00:03:04.935,"Sam tagged along for a while, but then I had to let her go."
00:03:04.977,00:03:08.689,"I had another date that night, and her name was Amber."
00:03:08.730,00:03:12.693,"Nine pints in, and it was us against the world."
00:03:12.734,00:03:20.993,"Things got mental in the beehive, so we repaired to the bowls club, or as we liked to call it, the smokehouse, which is when it all went fuck-up."
00:03:21.035,00:03:24.163,"Everyone got para and Pete chucked a whitey, so we had to bench him."
00:03:24.203,00:03:27.374,"In the end, we blew off the last three pubs and headed for the hills."
00:03:30.085,00:03:41.388,"I remember sitting up there, blood on my knuckles, beer down my shirt, sick on my shoes, seeing the orange glow of a new dawn break And knowing in my heart life would never feel this good again."
00:03:42.263,00:03:43.807,And you know what?
00:03:45.350,00:03:46.935,It never did.
00:03:49.604,00:03:53.525,"Thank you, Gary."
00:03:53.567,00:03:56.028,Would anyone like to add anything?
00:03:56.070,00:03:57.696,Or maybe challenge Gary?
00:03:57.738,00:04:00.365,Are you disappointed?
00:04:00.407,00:04:03.451,That you didn't make it to the world's end.
00:04:06.955,00:04:08.749,No.
00:04:08.790,00:04:11.752,that you want to do?
00:04:11.793,00:04:13.837,"Well, we wanna be free."
00:04:13.879,00:04:16.924,We wanna be free to-- to do what we wanna do.
00:04:16.965,00:04:20.719,"And we wanna get loaded, and we wanna have a good time, and that's what we're gonna do."
00:04:20.761,00:04:23.764,We're gonna have a good time.
00:05:38.672,00:05:41.424,Just what is it that you want to do?
00:05:41.466,00:05:44.552,"We wanna get loaded, and we wanna have a good time."
00:05:48.182,00:05:50.517,She's a beauty.
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.435,But she's no beast.
00:05:52.477,00:05:54.313,"Hello, Peter."
00:05:54.353,00:05:56.355,Jesus. Gary.
00:05:56.397,00:05:58.650,The once and future King.
00:05:58.692,00:06:01.444,Were you outside my house this morning?
00:06:01.486,00:06:03.197,I could have swore I saw you on my street.
00:06:03.238,00:06:06.365,I've never been to Bishop's Gardens.
00:06:06.407,00:06:08.493,I'm well.
00:06:08.535,00:06:10.369,"How's, um-- Vanessa?"
00:06:10.411,00:06:11.663,"No, your wife."
00:06:11.705,00:06:13.623,Yeah. How's she?
00:06:13.665,00:06:16.459,Ah.
00:06:16.501,00:06:19.004,Ooh! Twice!
00:06:19.046,00:06:21.506,"-We haven't changed, have we?"
00:06:21.548,00:06:24.843,"I-It's all right, dad."
00:06:26.553,00:06:29.348,"-So, Gary, how can I help you?"
00:06:29.388,00:06:32.184,Are you looking to buy a car?
00:06:32.226,00:06:34.561,I'm afraid the end is nigh.
00:06:34.602,00:06:37.564,What?
00:06:37.605,00:06:39.649,What do you mean?
00:06:39.691,00:06:42.069,"One night, five guys, 12 pubs."
00:06:42.110,00:06:43.528,Let battle commence.
00:06:43.570,00:06:45.322,You wanna try that again?
00:06:45.364,00:06:47.532,Isn't that something you've always wanted?
00:06:47.574,00:06:49.701,"Look, Peter, we didn't make it before."
00:06:49.743,00:06:52.204,But this time we are gonna see it through to the bitter end.
00:06:52.246,00:06:53.830,Or lager end.
00:06:53.872,00:06:55.707,We?
00:06:55.749,00:06:58.377,Even Andy?
00:06:58.417,00:07:01.338,"Well, I thought that after the accident-- Not an issue. He is in."
00:07:01.380,00:07:03.757,"What we wanna know is, are you?"
00:07:03.798,00:07:05.550,"Well, I'd have to check with Vanessa."
00:07:05.592,00:07:07.468,Who's Vanessa?
00:07:07.510,00:07:10.222,Since when have you had to check with your wife?
00:07:10.264,00:07:12.391,"Oh, come on, man."
00:07:12.432,00:07:15.769,The laughs?
00:07:15.810,00:07:18.772,"The hangovers so fierce, it feels like your head's full of ants?"
00:07:18.813,00:07:21.066,"-Well, maybe the first two."
00:07:21.108,00:07:23.568,-What's your new number?
00:07:23.610,00:07:25.862,Yeah?
00:07:27.781,00:07:32.077,"This entire row here, they'll all have dormer windows above the front elevation."
00:07:32.119,00:07:34.246,Who's the helmet without an helmet?
00:07:34.288,00:07:37.374,"Oh, for fuck's sake!"
00:07:37.416,00:07:39.793,That's Gary King.
00:07:42.796,00:07:45.882,"-Knock, knock!"
00:07:45.924,00:07:47.592,"You're supposed to say, who's there?"
00:07:47.634,00:07:50.720,I can see who's there.
00:07:50.762,00:07:53.765,I like what you've done with the place.
00:07:53.807,00:07:55.767,How's Selena?
00:07:55.809,00:07:57.769,We divorced ten years ago.
00:07:57.811,00:07:59.771,"Yeah, I know."
00:07:59.813,00:08:02.274,"She's doing very well, apparently."
00:08:02.316,00:08:04.943,-You got anyone else on the go?
00:08:04.985,00:08:07.279,She's a fitness instructor.
00:08:07.321,00:08:10.073,Pedophile! I'm kidding.
00:08:10.115,00:08:13.410,-No. Why are you here?
00:08:13.452,00:08:15.454,We're getting the band back together.
00:08:15.495,00:08:17.622,I'm not your bass player anymore.
00:08:17.664,00:08:19.458,"I mean, we're getting the boys back together."
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.918,"We can get the band back together as well, if you want."
00:08:21.960,00:08:24.796,"No, we can't."
00:08:24.838,00:08:27.966,"I've always wondered, what is that thing over the door called?"
00:08:28.008,00:08:30.802,-That's a lintel.
00:08:28.008,00:08:36.641,"-So, the plan is, we're gonna go back to Newton Haven, we are gonna do The Golden Mile, and this time we are gonna make it to the world's end."
00:08:36.683,00:08:38.852,Everybody's in.
00:08:38.893,00:08:40.603,"Oh, you better believe it, big balls."
00:08:40.645,00:08:43.315,Andy's going drinking with you?
00:08:43.357,00:08:46.776,Think about it.
00:08:43.357,00:08:48.653,"Go back to the old town, sink a few pints-- -Twelve pints."
00:08:48.695,00:08:50.864,Twelve pints is insane.
00:08:52.199,00:08:53.867,"What's this all about, Gary?"
00:08:53.908,00:08:56.328,It's about closure.
00:08:56.370,00:08:59.873,Why should getting older affect something as important as friendship?
00:08:59.914,00:09:02.959,"A lot's changed since then, Oliver."
00:09:03.001,00:09:05.670,This is our chance to take stock.
00:09:05.712,00:09:07.839,"Oh, a stock-take."
00:09:07.881,00:09:10.008,"Come on, O-Man."
00:09:10.050,00:09:12.344,What I'd really like is for you to take your D.M.'s off the sofa.
00:09:12.386,00:09:15.180,"Look, if you're worried about me, don't be, all right?"
00:09:15.222,00:09:18.641,I am here to tell you that Gary King is back on the horse.
00:09:18.683,00:09:20.352,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:09:18.683,00:09:22.645,You're-- You're back on the horse?
00:09:22.687,00:09:23.897,-What's bike?
00:09:23.938,00:09:25.524,-What's bike slang for?
00:09:25.565,00:09:27.526,-I'm lost.
00:09:27.567,00:09:30.570,"Listen, this is our chance to finally finish what we started."
00:09:30.611,00:09:33.323,"Come on, man!"
00:09:33.365,00:09:37.911,"Ah. Um-- I think we're all done, so-- H-how do you like the property?"
00:09:37.952,00:09:39.746,"Well, yeah, it's amazing, yeah."
00:09:39.787,00:09:41.873,Fantastic.
00:09:41.915,00:09:44.376,It's just a little bit out of our price range.
00:09:44.418,00:09:47.212,-He'll knock some off for you.
00:09:47.254,00:09:49.172,Fuck off.
00:09:50.757,00:09:53.051,You have my card.
00:09:53.093,00:09:56.555,"-Gary, W.T.F.?"
00:09:56.596,00:09:59.682,-Please don't call me O-Man.
00:09:59.724,00:10:01.560,-She's fine.
00:10:01.601,00:10:04.854,"So, Friday we'll all go down together, make a road trip of it. I'll drive."
00:10:04.896,00:10:07.399,"Oh, I don't think I can."
00:10:07.441,00:10:10.068,"Yeah, you do-- with Dr. Ink!"
00:10:10.110,00:10:11.861,You know? Dr. Ink.
00:10:11.903,00:10:14.364,"Yeah, drink."
00:10:14.406,00:10:17.033,It won't be the same without the O-Man.
00:10:17.075,00:10:19.744,You can see the guys.
00:10:19.786,00:10:21.580,Tell them how you're doing.
00:10:21.621,00:10:24.583,You never know.
00:10:24.624,00:10:27.586,Andy is definitely coming?
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.712,Andy Knightley?
00:10:30.671,00:10:32.882,And you convinced him how?
00:10:36.803,00:10:38.721,Mr. Knightley?
00:10:38.763,00:10:40.890,You have a friend here to see you.
00:10:43.310,00:10:44.894,"No, I don't."
00:10:44.936,00:10:47.939,"This is a bit grown-up, isn't it?"
00:10:47.981,00:10:49.690,Yep.
00:10:51.151,00:10:53.653,I saw the boys the other day.
00:10:53.694,00:10:57.240,O-Man. Stevie-Baby.
00:10:57.282,00:11:01.119,"Yeah, I remember the names of our childhood friends, Gary."
00:11:01.161,00:11:04.122,We had ourselves a little idea.
00:11:04.164,00:11:05.790,"Did you, now?"
00:11:05.832,00:11:08.460,"Yeah, we're gonna go back to Newton Haven."
00:11:08.502,00:11:12.046,For some unfinished business.
00:11:12.839,00:11:14.508,"That's a joke, right?"
00:11:14.549,00:11:17.302,"Five guys, 12 pubs, 50 pints."
00:11:17.344,00:11:18.845,Sixty pints.
00:11:18.886,00:11:21.473,"Steady on, you fucking alkie!"
00:11:21.515,00:11:24.309,"I haven't had a drink for 16 years, Gary."
00:11:24.351,00:11:26.811,"Look, we can go back, see the guys, chew the fat."
00:11:26.853,00:11:28.813,It'll be just like it always was.
00:11:28.855,00:11:31.191,"Except this time, we are gonna finish this thing once and for all."
00:11:31.232,00:11:33.026,"You have a very selective memory, Gary."
00:11:33.067,00:11:34.861,Thanks.
00:11:34.902,00:11:36.988,I remember the Monday mornings.
00:11:37.030,00:11:39.698,"Yeah, that's why we're going back on a Friday. Uhhh!"
00:11:39.740,00:11:42.827,Why do you think none of us live in Newton Haven anymore?
00:11:42.869,00:11:45.288,Because it is a black hole.
00:11:45.330,00:11:47.832,"It always was, and it always will be."
00:11:47.874,00:11:50.001,It's only boring 'cause we're not there.
00:11:50.043,00:11:52.837,-It's pointless arguing with you.
00:11:52.879,00:11:56.675,"I'm picking everybody up from high Wycombe station, Friday, 3:00 sharp."
00:11:56.715,00:12:00.220,"-No, Gary."
00:12:00.261,00:12:04.182,"No, actually."
00:12:04.224,00:12:06.976,What are you doing?
00:12:08.061,00:12:10.313,Is it a door?
00:12:10.355,00:12:13.483,And it's glass.
00:12:13.525,00:12:15.860,maybe it's a windoor.
00:12:15.902,00:12:17.696,You can have that.
00:12:17.736,00:12:19.239,"Please leave, Gary."
00:12:21.740,00:12:24.785,All right.
00:12:27.247,00:12:29.123,"600, wasn't it?"
00:12:32.877,00:12:36.548,"Oh, um, I thought you should know-- What?"
00:12:36.590,00:12:38.883,Mum died.
00:12:38.925,00:12:41.094,When?
00:12:42.262,00:12:44.514,The big cancer.
00:12:44.556,00:12:47.141,I'm-- I-I'm sorry.
00:12:48.142,00:12:50.437,"She just always really liked you, you know."
00:12:50.478,00:12:53.398,"Got me thinking about the old days, particularly that night, you know."
00:12:53.440,00:12:55.442,'Cause we were so happy.
00:12:55.483,00:13:03.491,"And, you know, I love the boys like brothers, but, uh, when all's said and done, you're the best friend I ever had."
00:13:05.118,00:13:07.203,"It was good to see you, mate."
00:13:19.090,00:13:21.008,Pete!
00:13:21.050,00:13:23.802,Steven! Thank God.
00:13:23.844,00:13:27.056,"I reckon that's not the last horrible feeling you're gonna have today, mate."
00:13:27.098,00:13:29.100,"This can't be happening, can it?"
00:13:29.142,00:13:31.770,What the hell are we doing here?
00:13:31.810,00:13:34.606,Follow Gary King into almost certain oblivion.
00:13:34.648,00:13:36.107,"Hello, Steven."
00:13:36.149,00:13:39.110,"All right, mate."
00:13:39.152,00:13:42.280,Didn't we decide to stop calling him fearless leader somewhere around 1992?
00:13:42.322,00:13:43.990,Old habits die hard.
00:13:44.031,00:13:46.284,They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.
00:13:46.326,00:13:48.745,He'll outlive us all.
00:13:48.787,00:13:50.622,Hang on a sec.
00:13:50.747,00:13:53.374,I'm just trying to decide which of us is the biggest idiot for coming.
00:14:00.298,00:14:03.134,maybe he had an accident.
00:14:03.176,00:14:05.470,Sorry.
00:14:05.512,00:14:09.848,"Gary having an accident would actually be the best outcome for all of us, including Gary."
00:14:12.811,00:14:15.062,Unbelievable.
00:14:19.192,00:14:21.986,"Oh, yes."
00:14:22.028,00:14:23.988,You're late.
00:14:24.030,00:14:26.115,"Yeah, you are."
00:14:26.157,00:14:28.034,"Yeah, 3:00 to 4:00."
00:14:28.075,00:14:30.829,"-You know your problem, Gary?"
00:14:30.870,00:14:34.207,-I can't believe you bought another Granada Mark II.
00:14:34.248,00:14:36.793,"Well, this looks exactly like the car I sold you in 1989."
00:14:36.835,00:14:39.671,This is the car you sold me in 1989.
00:14:39.713,00:14:42.298,This is the beast?
00:14:42.340,00:14:44.384,"I mean, she's had a bit of work done."
00:14:44.425,00:14:49.347,"I had to replace the, uh, brakes, suspension, exhaust, seats, wheels, paneling, carburetor, manifold-- whole engine, really."
00:14:49.389,00:14:52.350,"Mirrors, head lamps."
00:14:52.392,00:14:54.143,You could almost say an antique.
00:14:54.185,00:14:58.648,"Well, then, let's get this antique On the roadshow!"
00:15:04.070,00:15:06.865,"Come on, you bell-ends, we're gonna be late."
00:15:06.906,00:15:09.701,"And we're back, just like the Five Musketeers."
00:15:09.743,00:15:12.495,"-Three Musketeers, isn't it?"
00:15:12.537,00:15:15.790,"Nobody knows how many there were, really, do they?"
00:15:15.832,00:15:20.336,"You do know the Three Musketeers is a fiction, right?"
00:15:20.378,00:15:22.338,A lot of people are saying that about the bible these days.
00:15:22.380,00:15:24.340,"What, that it was written by Alexandre Dumas?"
00:15:24.382,00:15:26.342,"Don't be daft, Steve."
00:15:26.384,00:15:28.386,"Anyway, five sounds much better."
00:15:28.428,00:15:32.849,"I think they missed a trick only having three, 'cause if they'd had five, then two could have died and they'd still have three left."
00:15:32.891,00:15:34.934,Are we there yet?
00:15:49.490,00:15:51.576,Soup dragons.
00:15:51.618,00:15:53.745,I remember this one.
00:15:53.787,00:15:56.873,"I put this on a tape for you, didn't i?"
00:15:56.915,00:15:59.584,This is the tape?
00:15:59.626,00:16:02.754,Where'd you find it?
00:16:06.090,00:16:09.260,"Ooh, look!"
00:16:09.302,00:16:11.596,-No.
00:16:11.638,00:16:13.890,Fucking prat!
00:16:19.019,00:16:20.814,This is a long piss.
00:16:20.855,00:16:22.941,If it is a piss.
00:16:22.982,00:16:27.570,"Yeah, might be a little-- -Poo."
00:16:27.612,00:16:29.781,"Still work for your old man, Pete?"
00:16:29.823,00:16:32.325,I'm a partner now.
00:16:32.366,00:16:34.577,I started my own firm in '98.
00:16:34.619,00:16:36.245,Got bought out in '05.
00:16:36.287,00:16:38.665,I'm happier though.
00:16:38.706,00:16:40.249,Property.
00:16:40.291,00:16:43.461,"Yeah, I co-manage a boutique estate agency in north London."
00:16:43.503,00:16:45.087,Very competitive.
00:16:45.129,00:16:47.006,"Is it family law you're in, Andy?"
00:16:47.047,00:16:48.967,Does anyone know what Gary's doing?
00:16:49.008,00:16:52.136,"-Yeah, he's playing need for speed over there."
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.180,"Hasn't changed, has he?"
00:16:54.221,00:16:56.641,I don't know.
00:16:56.683,00:16:59.811,He did finally pay me back that 600 quid.
00:16:59.853,00:17:02.271,-He borrowed 200 off me.
00:17:03.523,00:17:05.441,I can't believe it!
00:17:05.483,00:17:07.944,I can't believe you'd do that.
00:17:07.986,00:17:09.779,"Of course, I can."
00:17:09.821,00:17:11.614,It's just robbing Peter to pay Paul!
00:17:11.656,00:17:14.659,"No, I borrowed it from Peter to pay you."
00:17:20.665,00:17:23.626,"Oh, shit!"
00:17:23.668,00:17:25.503,Newton Haven!
00:17:25.545,00:17:30.842,"Take a moment to look upon it in its original colors, boys, for tonight we paint it red."
00:17:30.884,00:17:33.052,Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
00:17:35.429,00:17:38.850,"-Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:17:38.892,00:17:41.101,Shit.
00:17:41.853,00:17:43.479,Fuck.
00:17:43.521,00:17:45.105,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"
00:17:45.147,00:17:46.524,Fuck! Fuck!
00:17:46.566,00:17:49.944,"No, it's okay."
00:17:52.363,00:17:54.365,"Know why I pulled you over, Sir?"
00:17:54.407,00:17:57.035,-Was the music too loud?
00:17:57.076,00:17:59.370,Your left brake light's faulty.
00:17:59.412,00:18:02.164,The old brake lights.
00:18:02.206,00:18:04.333,So called 'cause they're always breaking.
00:18:04.375,00:18:06.878,"I'll get that sorted out, officer."
00:18:06.920,00:18:09.129,"Let's see your license, Sir."
00:18:10.464,00:18:12.842,Ah. You know what?
00:18:12.884,00:18:15.511,And I left that at the bloody gym.
00:18:15.553,00:18:17.513,Any other form of identification?
00:18:17.555,00:18:20.224,No. It's all in my sports bag.
00:18:20.266,00:18:22.226,"That's bloody typical, isn't it?"
00:18:22.268,00:18:24.228,"Um, I'll give you my name and address."
00:18:24.270,00:18:26.230,You can run me through the old system?
00:18:26.272,00:18:27.565,"Go on, then."
00:18:27.607,00:18:34.196,"Peter Page, 48 Bishop's Gardens, London, N2 T12."
00:18:36.657,00:18:38.701,"Jesus, Gary."
00:18:38.743,00:18:41.704,-Why did you give him my name?
00:18:41.746,00:18:44.540,-Suppose I get done by the police!
00:18:44.582,00:18:46.292,He will check the number plate against his name.
00:18:46.333,00:18:49.045,I know. Why do you think I gave him Pete's name?
00:18:49.087,00:18:50.755,I own a car showroom.
00:18:50.797,00:18:53.049,-Just trust me.
00:18:53.091,00:18:55.093,Hello.
00:18:55.134,00:18:57.804,"So, Mr. Page, what brings you to Newton Haven?"
00:18:57.845,00:18:59.680,"Well, we're all from here."
00:18:59.764,00:19:02.475,"We're just back to see the sights, have a crack at the old golden mile."
00:19:02.516,00:19:04.393,Might get a bit messy.
00:19:04.435,00:19:06.604,"Well, you make sure you get that brake light fixed."
00:19:06.646,00:19:09.482,You might wanna do an emissions test too.
00:19:09.523,00:19:12.234,"Oh, and, Peter, don't make too much mess."
00:19:12.276,00:19:15.571,"Oh, we won't."
00:19:15.613,00:19:17.907,I don't understand.
00:19:17.949,00:19:21.160,"It's simple, Pete."
00:19:21.201,00:19:24.330,-It has been since 1989.
00:19:24.371,00:19:28.084,I know. I changed the log book.
00:19:28.126,00:19:30.086,"Jesus, you guys need to relax."
00:19:30.128,00:19:32.421,-Let's Boo-Boo!
00:19:44.517,00:19:47.145,Do you know how much trouble you could get into?
00:19:47.186,00:19:50.148,Do you know how much trouble I'm already in?
00:19:50.230,00:19:53.359,Oi. What the hell is this?
00:19:53.400,00:19:56.487,We are here to get annihilated.
00:19:56.529,00:19:59.615,-Have you got any plans for dinner at all?
00:19:59.657,00:20:22.262,"Tonight we will be partaking of a liquid repast As we wend our way up The Golden Mile, commencing with an inaugural tankard in the first post, then on to the old familiar, the famous cock, the cross hands, the good companions, the trusty servant, the two headed dog, the mermaid, the beehive, the King's head, and the hole in the wall for a measure of the same, all before the last bittersweet pint in that most fateful terminus, the world's end."
00:20:22.346,00:20:28.310,"Leave a light on, good lady, for though we may return with a twinkle in our eyes, we will, in truth, be blind drunk!"
00:21:49.142,00:21:51.393,Come on!
00:21:56.315,00:21:58.609,-Until 1840-- -Fucking hell.
00:21:58.651,00:22:11.164,"This building was the site of Newton Haven's first post office, until an enterprising business fellow decided that, far from befitting the sending and receiving of mail, it was perhaps better suited as a humble taproom Where a weary traveler might get twatted."
00:22:11.205,00:22:13.207,Come on!
00:22:14.374,00:22:16.460,Ah.
00:22:16.502,00:22:18.504,It's like déjà vu.
00:22:24.468,00:22:26.804,I don't remember this at all.
00:22:26.846,00:22:28.806,"Been bought by a chain, hasn't it?"
00:22:28.848,00:22:33.351,"Part of that nationwide initiative to rob small, charming pubs Of any discernible character."
00:22:33.393,00:22:36.105,"Starbucking, man."
00:22:36.147,00:22:38.482,Can't take away that smell though.
00:22:38.524,00:22:40.818,I'm sure they tried.
00:22:40.860,00:22:42.360,"Good evening, Raymondo."
00:22:42.402,00:22:44.864,The prodigal sons return.
00:22:44.905,00:22:46.949,Who's on the guest list tonight?
00:22:46.991,00:22:48.450,The guest ales.
00:22:48.492,00:22:52.872,"We, Sir, are doing The Golden Mile, and you have the honor of drawing first blood."
00:22:52.913,00:22:55.749,What do you recommend?
00:22:57.001,00:22:58.376,Rather fitting.
00:22:58.418,00:23:00.378,-I'm Gary King.
00:23:00.420,00:23:02.548,"So, tell me more."
00:23:02.589,00:23:04.842,Crowning glory. Is it nutty?
00:23:04.884,00:23:07.720,Does it have a surprisingly fruity note which lingers on the tongue?
00:23:07.761,00:23:09.347,"Mmm, it's beer."
00:23:09.387,00:23:11.307,"Mmm! We'll have five of those, please."
00:23:11.349,00:23:14.852,"No, sorry."
00:23:14.894,00:23:16.770,What?
00:23:24.611,00:23:26.446,I don't believe this.
00:23:27.365,00:23:31.702,A man of your legendary prowess Drinking Fucking rain.
00:23:31.744,00:23:34.580,It's like seeing a lion eating some hummus.
00:23:34.621,00:23:36.749,Doesn't make any sense.
00:23:36.790,00:23:39.085,You seriously have a problem with me not drinking after what happened?
00:23:39.126,00:23:41.087,"I don't, but King Arthur does."
00:23:41.128,00:23:43.547,"-Ooh, this'll be good."
00:23:43.589,00:23:51.429,"Do you honestly think that King Arthur came back from The Battle of Hastings, fucking rocked up at Arthur's castle-- Camelot."
00:23:49.469,00:23:53.599,"Walked up to the bar and went, hello!"
00:23:53.640,00:23:56.269,"No, because they didn't have running water in Arthurian times."
00:23:56.310,00:24:00.189,Exactly.
00:24:00.231,00:24:03.067,I'm less of a man because I choose to drink water?
00:24:03.109,00:24:05.527,"-Well, it's a bit ooh, ducky, isn't it?"
00:24:05.569,00:24:07.445,"Get out of the '90s, Pete."
00:24:07.487,00:24:10.408,"There is nothing ooh, ducky about being teetotal."
00:24:10.448,00:24:17.623,About walking into a pub after a rugby match and ordering a tap water At a bar packed full of big ugly bastards wearing war paint?
00:24:17.664,00:24:20.584,"That, my friend, takes confidence. Yeah?"
00:24:20.626,00:24:22.878,"You said it, poof!"
00:24:22.920,00:24:26.924,"I don't know if you're aware of this, but we are not teenagers anymore."
00:24:26.966,00:24:32.596,And God forbid you ever have children-- -I might have kids.
00:24:32.638,00:24:34.890,"No, I mean I might have kids."
00:24:34.932,00:24:40.562,You remember Karen Eggerton She was two weeks late when her parents emigrated to Normandy.
00:24:40.604,00:24:42.606,I never heard from her again.
00:24:42.648,00:24:44.566,She might have had a baby.
00:24:44.608,00:24:47.236,Imagine that.
00:24:47.278,00:24:48.821,It's pointless arguing with you.
00:24:48.862,00:24:51.407,"To kids, wherever they may be."
00:24:52.158,00:24:53.700,Kids.
00:24:55.828,00:24:58.122,Drink up.
00:24:58.164,00:25:01.167,-Boo-boo? What is that?
00:25:01.208,00:25:04.795,From Mr. Shepherd's classroom.
00:25:04.837,00:25:07.006,-From that Shakespeare play.
00:25:07.047,00:25:09.507,-Yeah. What was it called?
00:25:09.549,00:25:12.678,"That's it. If we needed to make a quick getaway, we'd say, exit, pursued by a bear."
00:25:12.719,00:25:14.638,"And then it was, exit, pursued by Yogi Bear."
00:25:14.680,00:25:18.017,"And then it was just, let's Yogi and Boo-Boo."
00:25:18.058,00:25:21.437,-So you're saying we should go?
00:25:24.982,00:25:27.026,Ah.
00:25:27.067,00:25:29.153,The old familiar.
00:25:29.195,00:25:32.572,"Now, this is a pub!"
00:25:33.866,00:25:37.535,This is more like it!
00:25:40.538,00:25:42.375,Like déjà vu.
00:25:42.416,00:25:44.710,"David, my man!"
00:25:44.751,00:25:48.339,Have you heard the news?
00:25:48.381,00:25:50.466,Who's he?
00:26:04.771,00:26:06.606,"How was the funeral, Gary?"
00:26:08.442,00:26:10.110,Your mum's funeral.
00:26:11.028,00:26:13.864,It's difficult to put into words.
00:26:13.906,00:26:21.163,"But if I had to choose three, I would say, really, really sad."
00:26:22.415,00:26:24.208,"Oh, no, that's two, isn't it?"
00:26:24.250,00:26:27.169,"How about, really, very sad."
00:26:28.128,00:26:30.172,It's a shame.
00:26:30.214,00:26:31.840,She was a good woman.
00:26:31.882,00:26:33.926,I really liked your mum.
00:26:33.967,00:26:35.844,"Me too, mate."
00:26:35.886,00:26:37.430,Me too.
00:26:37.471,00:26:39.390,-Hello.
00:26:39.432,00:26:41.892,-Are you here?
00:26:41.934,00:26:44.770,"Uh, you get lost on the ring road again?"
00:26:44.811,00:26:46.855,This is Newton Haven.
00:26:46.897,00:26:49.066,What time are you meeting the twins?
00:26:49.108,00:26:52.652,"Well, we're all at the old familiar."
00:26:53.571,00:26:54.988,"Yeah, he is."
00:26:55.822,00:26:57.408,Okay.
00:26:57.450,00:26:58.909,"Who was that, O-Man?"
00:26:58.951,00:27:00.618,"Don't call me O-Man, Gary."
00:27:00.660,00:27:04.582,If you must know-- -It was Sam.
00:27:04.622,00:27:06.624,Is there a fucking echo in here?
00:27:06.666,00:27:08.461,"Yes, Sam's here."
00:27:08.502,00:27:10.296,We're driving to mum's tomorrow.
00:27:10.337,00:27:13.132,"What, she's coming here?"
00:27:13.173,00:27:15.426,not this again.
00:27:15.468,00:27:17.094,I saw her first!
00:27:17.136,00:27:19.805,"Wow, you really have a selective memory, don't you?"
00:27:19.846,00:27:21.432,Somebody else was saying that.
00:27:21.474,00:27:23.100,Me.
00:27:23.142,00:27:27.980,"I told you I had a thing about Sam, and you proceeded to try and get in her pants at every opportunity."
00:27:28.021,00:27:30.941,"-Guys, please."
00:27:30.983,00:27:32.985,"That's right, because you did the school play!"
00:27:33.026,00:27:35.154,-Cabaret.
00:27:35.195,00:27:38.449,"She wore those fishnet stockings, and you got a big boner on stage."
00:27:38.491,00:27:40.117,Jesus Christ.
00:27:40.159,00:27:42.660,She always had a massive wide-on for Adrian Keane.
00:27:42.702,00:27:45.164,-I hated that prick.
00:27:42.702,00:27:51.504,"-Can we not Talk about my sister In relation to, A-- Massive wide-ons, B-- Steven's erect penis?"
00:27:51.545,00:27:53.797,All right.
00:27:53.839,00:27:55.673,I'm not answering that.
00:27:55.715,00:27:57.801,-Is she though?
00:27:57.843,00:28:00.471,-Fit.
00:28:00.513,00:28:02.181,Steven!
00:28:02.222,00:28:04.350,"You've grown, haven't you?"
00:28:04.391,00:28:06.477,-You look fantastic.
00:28:06.519,00:28:08.812,Andy. Wow.
00:28:08.854,00:28:10.272,"You're all right, yeah."
00:28:10.314,00:28:11.357,"Hi, Pete."
00:28:11.398,00:28:12.732,"All right, big brother?"
00:28:13.526,00:28:15.027,Gary.
00:28:15.068,00:28:17.196,Willkommen.
00:28:17.237,00:28:19.948,-Welcome.
00:28:19.990,00:28:22.326,"-Uh-- -Hey, Steve, she's just got here. Come on."
00:28:22.368,00:28:24.828,"-Sam, would you like a drink?"
00:28:24.870,00:28:26.205,"Thanks, Steven."
00:28:26.246,00:28:27.956,I'm just gonna nip to the loo.
00:28:27.998,00:28:30.917,Nature calls.
00:28:37.383,00:28:39.343,What are you doing?
00:28:39.385,00:28:42.513,I'm going to the toilet.
00:28:42.555,00:28:44.515,"Gary, you are out of your mind."
00:28:44.557,00:28:47.518,What are you talking about?
00:28:47.560,00:28:50.521,You went to the toilet.
00:28:50.563,00:28:53.649,Do you really think I'm gonna have sex with you in the ladies' toilet?
00:28:53.691,00:28:55.734,"Well, the disabled's is out of order."
00:28:55.775,00:28:57.986,"Gary, what happened?"
00:28:58.028,00:29:00.239,Maybe one of them put too many paper towels down the toilet.
00:29:00.280,00:29:03.033,"We don't know what they're thinking, really, do we?"
00:29:03.075,00:29:04.535,No.
00:29:04.577,00:29:06.704,Nothing.
00:29:06.745,00:29:08.830,Nothing happened to me.
00:29:08.872,00:29:10.708,No shit.
00:29:10.749,00:29:12.376,"So, do you wanna?"
00:29:14.127,00:29:17.047,"-Oliver, I'll see you later, hmm?"
00:29:17.089,00:29:18.882,I thought you weren't meeting the twins for another half hour.
00:29:18.924,00:29:21.801,"I'm not. Uh-- oh, yeah."
00:29:26.265,00:29:27.891,Out of order.
00:29:27.933,00:29:31.186,It's-- It's a private joke.
00:29:31.228,00:29:32.896,I don't want to know.
00:29:47.453,00:29:49.413,-What is that?
00:29:49.455,00:29:52.583,"It's a memorial, isn't it?"
00:29:52.625,00:29:54.418,"Hey, guys, do you know what time it Is?"
00:29:54.460,00:29:56.962,-It's not even 6:00.
00:29:57.003,00:30:00.132,It is high time we got onto the cock!
00:30:00.173,00:30:01.258,Whoo-hoo!
00:30:01.300,00:30:03.135,Right!
00:30:03.176,00:30:05.095,Let's go!
00:30:05.137,00:30:06.846,come on.
00:30:11.143,00:30:13.228,Oh!
00:30:14.354,00:30:17.065,"When you're ready, mate."
00:30:20.694,00:30:22.821,"Oh, shit!"
00:30:22.862,00:30:25.449,Basil.
00:30:25.491,00:30:34.333,"Do you remember we used to come in here and listen to him talk about fucking U.F.O.'s And lizard people and underwater Nazis and-- Didn't he spout some bullshit about the Bermuda Triangle actually, being a square?"
00:30:34.374,00:30:37.294,"No, he said it was two isosceles triangles forming a rhombus."
00:30:37.336,00:30:39.463,"He was your best mate, wasn't he, Steve?"
00:30:39.505,00:30:41.340,"No, he wasn't my best mate, Gary."
00:30:41.381,00:30:43.967,"He was a lonely old guy, and I felt a bit sorry for him."
00:30:44.009,00:30:47.137,-Basil!
00:30:47.179,00:30:49.765,Maybe we're not the local legends you think we are.
00:30:49.807,00:30:51.433,Gary King.
00:30:51.475,00:30:53.226,You're barred.
00:30:55.061,00:30:57.523,I cannot fucking believe this.
00:30:57.564,00:31:00.442,"-Leave it, Gary."
00:31:00.484,00:31:02.778,Have them all in the next one for all I care.
00:31:02.820,00:31:05.447,"We've gotta have one in every pub, otherwise the whole thing's fucked."
00:31:05.489,00:31:08.617,"-I'd say it was fairly fucked already, mate."
00:31:15.499,00:31:18.001,How much more of this do we have to endure?
00:31:18.043,00:31:20.003,That was three.
00:31:20.045,00:31:22.005,Fuck that.
00:31:22.047,00:31:24.007,We can get some food in the next pub.
00:31:24.049,00:31:26.009,As long as it's reasonably healthy.
00:31:26.051,00:31:27.720,This is Newton Haven.
00:31:27.761,00:31:29.722,Hardly the heart of the organic revolution.
00:31:29.763,00:31:31.682,I doubt it's the heart of anything.
00:31:31.724,00:31:33.517,My wife wanted us to go organic.
00:31:33.559,00:31:36.019,"The problem is, I kind of like eating shit."
00:31:36.061,00:31:38.897,Keep up!
00:31:40.566,00:31:43.235,"Oh, yeah."
00:31:43.276,00:31:45.863,"We had a new year's in here, didn't we?"
00:31:45.904,00:31:48.741,"-Isn't that when you slept on the pool table, Andy?"
00:31:48.782,00:31:51.368,"Yeah, for six hours."
00:31:51.410,00:31:54.204,"Thank you, flaming Sambucas."
00:31:54.246,00:32:01.044,"Oh, yeah, when you woke up, we said you'd been asleep for a year and that it was 1991, and you freaked out and punched a clock."
00:32:01.086,00:32:03.046,That was a great night.
00:32:03.088,00:32:06.174,"-Didn't you manage to get off with Erika Leekes, Peter?"
00:32:06.216,00:32:08.677,"Something of a personal triumph, if I say so myself."
00:32:08.719,00:32:11.388,She of the marmalade sandwich fame.
00:32:11.430,00:32:14.892,-The very same.
00:32:14.933,00:32:17.185,Two blondes and a redhead in the middle.
00:32:17.227,00:32:18.771,The marmalade sandwich!
00:32:18.812,00:32:21.398,Becky Salt.
00:32:21.440,00:32:23.942,-Why don't you ask them?
00:32:23.983,00:32:27.571,"I mean, sitting at that table over there are two blondes and a redhead in the middle."
00:32:27.613,00:32:29.239,Shut the fuck up!
00:32:29.281,00:32:31.784,"Erika Leekes on the left, Tracy Benson on the right."
00:32:31.825,00:32:34.912,"And by process of elimination, that's Becky Salt in the middle."
00:32:34.953,00:32:36.622,That is very spooky.
00:32:36.663,00:32:38.707,We should get them over!
00:32:38.749,00:32:41.752,Leave the past where it is.
00:32:41.794,00:32:45.255,You make it sound like we're fucking ancient.
00:32:45.297,00:32:47.424,"-I mean, sure, Steve's let himself go a bit."
00:32:47.466,00:32:50.260,"Pete's still got the same haircut, and Oliver's still got his Mark of the devil."
00:32:50.302,00:32:52.763,"No, he hasn't."
00:32:52.805,00:32:55.098,It's a small price to pay for not being called fucking O-Man.
00:32:55.140,00:32:56.934,It works for sisters of mercy tattoos as well.
00:32:56.975,00:32:58.435,I still like the sisters of mercy.
00:32:58.477,00:33:00.646,"-Oh, good job, or you'd never go swimming."
00:33:00.687,00:33:04.149,-Don't be.
00:33:04.190,00:33:06.526,"-Cheers, mate."
00:33:08.445,00:33:10.238,Is this seat taken?
00:33:11.323,00:33:14.367,"-Have it, mate."
00:33:17.203,00:33:19.289,Wasn't that-- Shane Hawkins.
00:33:19.331,00:33:21.458,Mmm.
00:33:21.500,00:33:23.752,Hang on. What happened with Shane Hawkins again?
00:33:23.794,00:33:26.505,"I'd rather not bring it all up again, if that's okay."
00:33:26.546,00:33:28.590,"Hey, now listen, Pete."
00:33:28.632,00:33:34.471,Bottling up past trauma can lead to inadequate coping strategies in later life Apparently.
00:33:34.513,00:33:36.598,"Oh, I don't know."
00:33:36.640,00:33:42.312,"I-It's not about the fact that he bullied me, that he made me miss more school days than chicken pox."
00:33:42.354,00:33:49.486,"It's not even that he forced me to spend entire lessons hiding in a toilet cubicle, or that he punched me so hard he dislodged my eyeball."
00:33:49.528,00:33:52.489,And it's not even that he ruined a large portion of my childhood.
00:33:52.531,00:33:56.827,"No, it's the fact that just then, he didn't recognize me."
00:33:56.869,00:34:01.122,"He looked straight through me, like it all meant nothing."
00:34:02.207,00:34:04.501,"And that probably sounds weird, doesn't it?"
00:34:04.543,00:34:06.003,Shots!
00:34:06.044,00:34:09.006,S-H-O-T-S.
00:34:09.047,00:34:12.175,"-What are you doing, Gary?"
00:34:12.217,00:34:15.679,"Firstly, Peter was talking about something which clearly made him feel very uncomfortable."
00:34:15.721,00:34:18.015,"That's all right, Andy."
00:34:18.056,00:34:20.392,"Secondly, 12 pints is more than enough."
00:34:20.433,00:34:23.020,"And thirdly, I don't fucking drink."
00:34:23.061,00:34:25.188,"I kn-- but shots don't count, do they?"
00:34:25.230,00:34:28.692,You said you wanted to catch up and chew the fat. I think you just wanted to drink it.
00:34:28.734,00:34:32.237,We're not here as your friends.
00:34:32.278,00:34:34.531,Enabler!
00:34:34.573,00:34:37.200,Gary King and the enablers.
00:34:37.242,00:34:39.369,Write that down.
00:34:39.411,00:34:41.580,"-Is that a thing now, is it?"
00:34:41.621,00:34:43.707,You don't need us to help you get fucked up.
00:34:43.749,00:34:47.377,You have done a perfectly good job so far on your own.
00:34:47.419,00:34:50.672,"I'm gonna go and see if there's a bus back to London, if anyone wants to come with me."
00:34:50.714,00:34:54.718,"Well, you can't go!"
00:34:54.760,00:34:57.095,"It's not the anniversary, Gary."
00:34:57.136,00:34:59.097,"But it's the anniversary of the year, isn't it?"
00:34:59.138,00:35:01.850,-Every year is the anniversary of a year!
00:35:01.892,00:35:05.687,-And it's not that the town's changed. We have changed.
00:35:05.729,00:35:08.356,"Yeah, well, you can't go 'cause the buses are finished."
00:35:08.398,00:35:10.943,Then I'm gonna go back to the B and B.
00:35:10.984,00:35:13.737,"-I could do with an early one, actually."
00:35:13.779,00:35:16.239,"Yeah, I'm gonna go and find Sam with Oliver."
00:35:16.281,00:35:18.116,"That's settled then, yeah?"
00:35:18.157,00:35:21.078,You know what I think?
00:35:21.119,00:35:26.083,"Yeah, you've got your houses and your cars And your wives and your job security."
00:35:26.124,00:35:29.419,You don't have what I have-- freedom.
00:35:29.461,00:35:33.757,"You're all slaves, and I am free to do what I want any old time."
00:35:33.799,00:35:36.217,And this is what you want?
00:35:36.259,00:35:39.596,"You should grow up, mate."
00:35:39.638,00:35:42.140,"Yeah, b-but mum died."
00:35:42.181,00:35:45.560,And we're all very sorry.
00:35:48.063,00:35:50.690,I thought we were home.
00:35:56.362,00:35:58.448,I can't help feeling sorry for him.
00:36:06.999,00:36:09.459,Don't.
00:36:18.301,00:36:20.637,Oh-- Fuck!
00:36:20.679,00:36:22.388,Fuck!
00:36:30.022,00:36:31.690,Careful.
00:36:31.731,00:36:33.817,The floor's a bit pissy.
00:36:33.859,00:36:35.735,Wasn't me.
00:36:39.031,00:36:41.324,That was me.
00:36:41.366,00:36:43.451,Did that back in '90.
00:36:44.995,00:36:47.205,1990.
00:36:48.206,00:36:50.333,Punched the shit out of the wall.
00:36:50.375,00:36:53.086,I don't know why.
00:36:54.046,00:36:56.089,Seemed important at the time.
00:36:58.550,00:37:01.845,You guys look like you're having a good night though.
00:37:01.887,00:37:05.473,"I'm doing The Golden Mile tonight, if you wanna tag along."
00:37:05.515,00:37:08.101,We could be like the six Musketeers.
00:37:11.396,00:37:14.107,I said we're doing The Golden Mile.
00:37:17.402,00:37:19.529,"You think you're so cool, don't you?"
00:37:19.571,00:37:21.364,Huh?
00:37:21.406,00:37:23.200,"Well, we were cooler."
00:37:23.241,00:37:25.702,We owned this town.
00:37:25.744,00:37:27.579,We blazed a trail.
00:37:27.620,00:37:29.831,Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you.
00:37:29.873,00:37:32.167,Please don't.
00:37:32.209,00:37:34.044,You don't want to do that.
00:37:34.086,00:37:35.628,"Oh, don't I?"
00:38:01.113,00:38:02.655,What?
00:38:07.619,00:38:09.579,I'm gonna kill him!
00:38:09.621,00:38:12.207,Andy!
00:38:12.249,00:38:14.626,"-Andy, this kid just attacked-- -Don't you dare change the subject!"
00:38:14.667,00:38:17.045,-He smashed my head in the mirror!
00:38:17.087,00:38:20.632,Your mum!
00:38:20.673,00:38:23.593,-Is that real?
00:38:23.635,00:38:25.262,Andy-- His head just came off!
00:38:25.303,00:38:27.764,"No, Gary! You are not gonna wriggle out of it this time!"
00:38:45.323,00:38:49.702,W T F?
00:39:17.897,00:39:19.691,"Oh, shit."
00:39:20.900,00:39:23.444,Ah! Get off-- Get off of me!
00:39:38.501,00:39:40.586,Huh?
00:39:53.391,00:39:55.476,Aah!
00:40:11.910,00:40:13.786,Aaah!
00:40:23.922,00:40:25.715,Gary!
00:40:25.757,00:40:27.384,Hey!
00:40:27.425,00:40:51.866,"Andy, did you see th-- Whoa!"
00:41:03.795,00:41:06.214,"W.T.F., Gary?"
00:41:06.256,00:41:08.466,W.T.F.?
00:41:08.507,00:41:11.928,What the fuck does W.T.F. mean?
00:41:11.970,00:41:13.388,What the fuck?
00:41:13.430,00:41:15.265,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:15.307,00:41:17.225,"This can't be happening, can it?"
00:41:17.267,00:41:19.769,"You said it, mate."
00:41:19.811,00:41:23.106,"I know, mate."
00:41:23.148,00:41:25.400,That was a white lie.
00:41:25.442,00:41:27.152,"She's not dead, is she?"
00:41:27.193,00:41:28.736,She's not dead!
00:41:28.778,00:41:31.781,Hey! W-w-w-wait!
00:41:31.823,00:41:33.950,-To get help.
00:41:33.992,00:41:36.786,"-What, don't get help?"
00:41:36.828,00:41:38.413,-Wait. Who are you calling?
00:41:38.455,00:41:39.914,Who's Vanessa?
00:41:39.956,00:41:41.791,-Why are you calling your wife?
00:41:41.833,00:41:43.793,You just said you don't know how far this goes.
00:41:43.835,00:41:45.837,I was just thinking about the pub.
00:41:45.878,00:41:48.423,-I can't get through.
00:41:48.465,00:41:50.675,I've got full bars.
00:41:50.716,00:41:54.429,Your call cannot be connected.
00:41:54.471,00:41:56.306,Your call cannot be connected.
00:41:56.348,00:41:57.807,Must be the network.
00:41:57.849,00:42:01.560,Holy shit.
00:42:02.687,00:42:05.357,This explains why everything's gone fuck-up.
00:42:05.398,00:42:08.651,Everybody's been replaced by one of these. That's why no one recognized us!
00:42:08.693,00:42:10.528,"Basil, Dave, Raymondo."
00:42:10.569,00:42:12.780,I thought it was weird.
00:42:12.822,00:42:14.491,Exactly!
00:42:14.532,00:42:16.659,It's not us that's changed.
00:42:16.701,00:42:19.329,"I'm right, aren't I, Andy?"
00:42:19.371,00:42:21.498,"-Andy, aren't I right?"
00:42:21.539,00:42:24.667,"Look, whatever the fuck's happening, we can't stay in the gents forever."
00:42:24.709,00:42:28.838,"Ten people have entered this toilet in the last five minutes, and not a single one's come back out again."
00:42:28.880,00:42:31.716,-That's gonna look suspicious.
00:42:31.757,00:42:34.177,And that's worse than five dismembered bodies?
00:42:34.219,00:42:35.678,This is Newton Haven.
00:42:47.399,00:42:49.734,How's it looking?
00:42:49.775,00:42:51.110,Very normal.
00:42:52.404,00:42:54.697,-I don't like it.
00:42:54.739,00:42:56.449,Let's finish our drinks.
00:43:08.586,00:43:10.880,I say we neck these and get the fuck out of here.
00:43:10.922,00:43:12.549,To London?
00:43:12.590,00:43:14.426,Are you fucking kidding?
00:43:15.634,00:43:18.012,It's the good companions next.
00:43:18.054,00:43:20.056,Are you saying we move on to the next pub?
00:43:20.098,00:43:22.058,We should get in the beast and head back to London.
00:43:22.100,00:43:24.852,-My brake light is broken.
00:43:24.894,00:43:26.896,-I'm way over the limit.
00:43:26.938,00:43:29.190,I don't wanna put any more points on Pete's license.
00:43:29.232,00:43:31.650,Andy can drive.
00:43:44.747,00:43:48.084,That settles it then.
00:43:48.126,00:43:52.755,"A-- we're all drunk, B-- they might be in on it, and C-- we've got blood on our hands."
00:43:52.797,00:43:54.591,It's more like ink.
00:43:54.632,00:43:57.051,"So, has it got messy yet?"
00:43:57.093,00:44:00.263,-What?
00:44:00.305,00:44:03.724,-Four.
00:44:03.766,00:44:06.227,Plenty more fun to be had.
00:44:06.269,00:44:08.104,"Enjoy your night, Peter."
00:44:08.146,00:44:10.440,Thank you.
00:44:10.482,00:44:12.191,Thank you.
00:44:15.153,00:44:17.363,Sorry.
00:44:15.153,00:44:19.698,"The way I see it, -we've told everybody we're doing The Golden Mile."
00:44:19.740,00:44:22.785,"If we suddenly jump in the beast now and head for the hills, they're gonna know that we know."
00:44:22.827,00:44:26.289,"But if we keep doing what we're doing And going where we're going, then they're not gonna know."
00:44:26.331,00:44:28.583,Know what?
00:44:28.625,00:44:30.960,I suggest we finish what we started and leave quietly in the morning.
00:44:31.002,00:44:33.963,You're really suggesting-- We finish The Golden Mile.
00:44:34.005,00:44:36.299,It's pointless arguing with him.
00:44:36.341,00:44:38.426,Drink up.
00:44:44.140,00:44:49.770,"five friends on a night out, having a good time."
00:45:51.624,00:45:53.501,Drinking.
00:45:53.543,00:45:54.586,Beer.
00:45:54.627,00:45:56.212,Shall we?
00:46:01.259,00:46:03.844,I feel a little uncomfortable drinking this much.
00:46:03.886,00:46:05.846,"No, man, it's like Dutch courage, isn't it?"
00:46:05.888,00:46:09.934,"You know, when the English soldiers used to drink Dutch gin before battle To give them super strength."
00:46:09.975,00:46:12.353,I thought that was to numb the sense of impending doom.
00:46:12.395,00:46:14.063,Exactly.
00:46:14.105,00:46:16.691,"We're just five friends on a night out, having a good time."
00:46:38.129,00:46:39.631,I need the toilet.
00:46:39.672,00:46:41.716,Go on then.
00:46:41.758,00:46:44.093,Huh?
00:46:45.928,00:46:48.889,He didn't make it this far last time.
00:46:48.931,00:46:50.725,"You're enjoying this, aren't you?"
00:46:50.767,00:46:52.977,"Yeah, five guys on a night out, having a great time."
00:46:53.018,00:46:55.772,Pretending to have a great time.
00:46:55.812,00:46:58.983,"If we get out of here alive, I'm gonna kill you."
00:46:59.024,00:47:00.568,"We're still in the dark here, Gary."
00:47:00.652,00:47:03.112,Our families could be in danger for all we know.
00:47:03.154,00:47:05.406,I know.
00:47:05.448,00:47:07.241,For reals this time.
00:47:07.283,00:47:09.619,"-Hey, why don't we just ask somebody?"
00:47:09.661,00:47:11.036,Who?
00:47:12.121,00:47:14.624,The Reverend Green.
00:47:14.666,00:47:17.293,Hey! What the fuck are you doing?
00:47:17.335,00:47:20.755,I'm gonna go and have a little chat with the Reverend Green.
00:47:20.797,00:47:22.131,You're gonna buy drugs?
00:47:22.173,00:47:28.596,"I'm gonna go over there and subtly check If that is the Reverend Green, and if it is, I can ask him what's going on."
00:47:28.638,00:47:30.306,And possibly buy some drugs.
00:47:30.348,00:47:32.141,What if he's one of them?
00:47:32.183,00:47:36.145,"Look, me and the reverend had a highly sophisticated code When discussing the purchase of herbal narcotics."
00:47:36.187,00:47:40.650,"If he doesn't understand me, it means he's one of them, and I will simply walk away."
00:47:47.699,00:47:49.701,Have you got any drugs?
00:47:49.742,00:47:51.786,"Don't do that anymore, Gary."
00:47:51.828,00:47:54.288,That.
00:47:54.330,00:47:56.290,'Cause drug dealing's not good enough for you?
00:47:56.332,00:47:58.292,"There are no drug dealers anymore, Gary."
00:47:58.334,00:48:00.503,I've got a proper job and a proper office.
00:48:00.545,00:48:03.005,You had a proper office.
00:48:03.047,00:48:05.007,Nothing wrong with doing your business in the toilet.
00:48:05.049,00:48:07.884,"Look, a lot has changed since you've left."
00:48:07.926,00:48:09.970,How much do you know?
00:48:10.012,00:48:13.474,How much is a little?
00:48:13.516,00:48:16.018,Shh! Keep your voice down.
00:48:16.060,00:48:18.312,Tell us then.
00:48:18.354,00:48:20.690,Do you even know what robot means?
00:48:20.732,00:48:24.235,"It's like, hello. I am a robot."
00:48:24.276,00:48:27.154,"It means slave, and believe me, they're not slaves."
00:48:27.196,00:48:29.990,Are you their prisoner?
00:48:30.032,00:48:31.534,Tell your face.
00:48:31.576,00:48:33.619,Hey.
00:48:33.661,00:48:36.497,"The town's been invaded by robots who aren't robots, and the rev's their prisoner."
00:48:36.539,00:48:38.040,I'm not.
00:48:38.082,00:48:40.585,We're leaving first thing.
00:48:40.626,00:48:43.713,I'm not going.
00:48:43.755,00:48:45.047,"You've said too much, Trevor."
00:48:45.089,00:48:46.923,"Yeah, put a cork in it, Trevor."
00:48:46.965,00:48:49.051,I'm just trying to help.
00:48:49.093,00:48:50.762,They will have everything in hand.
00:48:50.803,00:48:52.054,Are you guys robots?
00:48:52.096,00:48:55.808,"Well, the word robot Actually comes from an old Czech word."
00:48:55.850,00:48:57.268,Robotnik.
00:48:57.309,00:48:58.895,And we're not slaves.
00:48:58.935,00:49:01.063,And not robots.
00:49:01.105,00:49:03.107,"Oh, my God!"
00:49:03.148,00:49:05.192,-Shut up about robots!
00:49:08.362,00:49:11.073,"Could you put Trevor on, please?"
00:49:11.115,00:49:12.491,Trevor.
00:49:15.453,00:49:17.789,It's your supervisor.
00:49:19.956,00:49:21.751,"Hello, Trevor."
00:49:21.793,00:49:24.086,"Hello, Sir."
00:49:24.128,00:49:29.258,But-- I understand.
00:49:49.487,00:49:51.155,Thanks a bunch.
00:49:56.828,00:49:59.121,What did I miss?
00:49:59.163,00:50:00.623,Your friends trying to help.
00:50:00.665,00:50:03.250,We don't need your help.
00:50:04.168,00:50:07.045,I suggest you get on your way.
00:50:08.798,00:50:10.675,I think we should do what he says.
00:50:10.716,00:50:12.426,Okay.
00:50:17.013,00:50:19.433,"Five more, coming up."
00:50:20.476,00:50:22.018,Here we go.
00:50:24.522,00:50:26.315,Come on!
00:50:26.357,00:50:28.317,Gary!
00:50:28.359,00:50:30.987,"Let's just get in and out of this one, yeah?"
00:50:31.027,00:50:33.155,No more making new friends!
00:50:33.197,00:50:36.325,"Ah, gentlemen."
00:50:36.367,00:50:39.662,What'll it be?
00:50:39.704,00:50:43.039,-Uh-- -Might I recommend five pints of crowning glory?
00:50:43.081,00:50:45.125,"Rather fitting, wouldn't you say, Gary?"
00:50:45.167,00:50:46.794,What?
00:50:46.836,00:50:49.380,"It's a delightful brew-- hoppy, nutty, foamy."
00:50:49.421,00:50:52.717,Does it have a surprisingly fruity note that lingers on the tongue?
00:50:52.758,00:50:55.636,"Well, you're obviously a connoisseur."
00:50:55.678,00:51:01.684,"Then you'll already know that it's a rare treat For rogues, reverends, royalty and all good folks between."
00:51:01.726,00:51:03.352,"Well, five of those, please."
00:51:03.394,00:51:05.270,"Welcome home, boys."
00:51:08.357,00:51:10.860,I don't remember him being that friendly.
00:51:10.902,00:51:14.363,-He's obviously one of them.
00:51:14.405,00:51:16.699,We don't know what they remember.
00:51:16.741,00:51:18.701,Maybe they have selective memories.
00:51:18.743,00:51:20.369,"Yeah, like what's-his-name-- Me!"
00:51:20.411,00:51:22.705,"Maybe he's one of the others, like the Reverend."
00:51:22.747,00:51:26.208,"-It's hard to tell, isn't it?"
00:51:26.250,00:51:28.335,Wait. Which ones are the thems again?
00:51:28.377,00:51:30.212,"Well, they're both thems."
00:51:30.254,00:51:32.673,"Is he one of them, or is he one of them?"
00:51:32.715,00:51:37.845,"We need different terms, one for people that aren't robots-- And one for robots who aren't robots."
00:51:37.887,00:51:39.597,All right.
00:51:39.638,00:51:44.060,"We need to be able to differentiate between them, them and us."
00:51:44.100,00:51:46.270,"Yeah, I think the pronouns are really confusing."
00:51:46.311,00:51:48.064,I don't even know what a pronoun is.
00:51:48.439,00:51:51.776,"It's a word that can function by itself, as a noun, which refers to something else."
00:51:51.817,00:51:53.069,I don't get it.
00:51:53.109,00:51:54.403,Did I?
00:51:54.445,00:51:55.404,What Is?
00:51:55.446,00:51:56.405,Is it?
00:51:56.447,00:52:00.076,"Look, we just need a fucking word So we can identify who's who."
00:52:00.116,00:52:01.911,"Like, he's a blank."
00:52:01.953,00:52:04.455,Those two people are definitely blanks.
00:52:05.957,00:52:07.165,Sam.
00:52:08.084,00:52:10.628,"I've got this, Steve."
00:52:12.838,00:52:14.924,"All right, Sam?"
00:52:14.966,00:52:16.717,How's your night going?
00:52:16.759,00:52:19.135,Good.
00:52:19.971,00:52:21.889,"What do you mean, sort of?"
00:52:23.015,00:52:25.476,"Well, it's weird, isn't it?"
00:52:25.517,00:52:29.814,"You come back and everything's the same, but sort of different."
00:52:29.855,00:52:31.482,Different how?
00:52:32.691,00:52:34.777,Just weird.
00:52:34.819,00:52:36.112,"What are you getting at, Gary?"
00:52:36.152,00:52:38.072,Come with me.
00:52:40.449,00:52:43.953,"-Fuck's sake, Gary! Take a hint!"
00:52:43.995,00:52:45.704,Why are we in the disabled toilets then?
00:52:45.830,00:52:49.750,"There's something I need to tell you. Unless you want to have sex, in which case I'll tell you afterwards."
00:52:49.792,00:52:51.460,Tell me right now.
00:52:51.502,00:52:53.211,Apart from the fact that they're twins?
00:52:53.253,00:52:55.131,Just because they're twins doesn't automatically make them creepy.
00:52:55.171,00:52:56.757,It does a little bit.
00:52:56.799,00:53:00.302,A-- I did not.
00:53:00.344,00:53:03.263,"A-- It's a small town, B-- I'm not stupid, and C-- They told me."
00:53:03.305,00:53:05.016,"Well, I did once."
00:53:05.057,00:53:07.143,"Which was creepy, 'cause it was like there was four of them."
00:53:07.183,00:53:08.644,I'm not proud of it.
00:53:08.686,00:53:11.147,Is this what you wanted to tell me?
00:53:11.187,00:53:12.690,Aah!
00:53:14.399,00:53:15.776,"Are you okay, Sam?"
00:53:15.818,00:53:17.361,I need a cigarette.
00:53:18.320,00:53:20.865,-Nobots!
00:53:20.906,00:53:23.826,I think we should get away from the whole robots thing.
00:53:23.868,00:53:25.870,What's he up to?
00:53:25.911,00:53:28.831,"Oh, don't worry."
00:53:28.873,00:53:30.248,Andy.
00:53:31.542,00:53:34.628,"Oh, my God, that man is full of shit."
00:53:34.670,00:53:37.422,-I know that's not a surprise to you.
00:53:38.716,00:53:46.640,"He said that Newton Haven Has been taken over by robots full of blue stuff, and if we don't do what they say, they'll make us their prisoners."
00:53:46.682,00:53:48.266,Did you believe him?
00:53:49.225,00:53:51.062,"No, of course not."
00:53:53.189,00:53:54.857,Did you believe him?
00:53:54.899,00:53:57.026,What?
00:54:09.371,00:54:10.998,See?
00:54:11.040,00:54:14.085,You know better than to believe Gary King.
00:54:15.086,00:54:16.628,"Oh, crumbs."
00:54:17.713,00:54:19.631,Sam!
00:54:27.389,00:54:30.308,"God, you creepy bitches!"
00:54:45.281,00:54:46.909,Chuck us a ciggy.
00:54:46.951,00:54:50.537,Oh. Uh-- yes.
00:54:50.579,00:54:54.541,"Gary, what's happening?"
00:54:54.583,00:54:56.043,"Oh. Yes, you did."
00:54:56.085,00:54:57.962,"We should get inside, eh?"
00:54:58.003,00:55:00.547,Otherwise people are going to ask what the hell is going on.
00:55:00.589,00:55:02.591,-What the hell is going on?
00:55:02.633,00:55:05.594,-Got what?
00:55:05.636,00:55:06.845,What?
00:55:06.887,00:55:09.431,We have been through some crazy shit tonight.
00:55:09.473,00:55:13.309,All right?
00:55:13.351,00:55:18.649,"And if everything is as fucked up as it seems, then there's something I need to tell you."
00:55:18.690,00:55:22.611,"You might think this is because I've had seven pints, but it's not."
00:55:22.653,00:55:26.282,It's not.
00:55:26.322,00:55:28.242,I always have been.
00:55:28.284,00:55:32.621,And it breaks my heart to see you waste your affections on Gary fucking King.
00:55:32.663,00:55:34.790,"Hey, that's a bit harsh."
00:55:34.832,00:55:41.588,"-There is nothing between me-- -And while I'm being honest, just to lay it all out there, I am currently seeing a fitness instructor."
00:55:41.630,00:55:47.511,"She's 26 years old, but I would drop her in a heartbeat If it meant that I had one last chance with you."
00:55:47.552,00:55:51.015,"Steven, there is nothing between me and Gary King."
00:55:53.851,00:55:55.269,"Oh, fuck!"
00:56:11.994,00:56:13.453,-Huh?
00:56:22.004,00:56:24.173,Hey! Get your feet off her!
00:56:24.215,00:56:26.717,-Yes!
00:56:28.177,00:56:31.138,Pop its head off!
00:56:32.890,00:56:36.227,Yeah!
00:56:38.062,00:56:39.563,Blue-bloods.
00:56:39.604,00:56:43.317,N-nothing suggested in the last three minutes Has been better than smashy-smashy egg men.
00:56:43.359,00:56:45.194,N-nothing.
00:56:45.236,00:56:47.654,Did you guys think of a name for the robots who aren't robots?
00:56:47.696,00:56:50.199,I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.
00:56:50.241,00:56:52.826,"Well, we just had a Barney with two blanks in the beer garden."
00:56:58.374,00:57:00.042,Let's hit the mermaid.
00:57:00.084,00:57:01.835,Wait. What?
00:57:01.877,00:57:04.046,Number eight?
00:57:04.088,00:57:05.672,"Andy, what's happening?"
00:57:05.714,00:57:10.886,"Gary thinks we should keep up with the crawl, because they know what we're doing, but they don't know that we know what they're doing."
00:57:10.928,00:57:14.098,"And basically, n-no one else has a better idea, so fuck it."
00:57:15.807,00:57:18.185,What?
00:57:18.227,00:57:20.312,Wait!
00:57:23.607,00:57:27.027,a better idea. I'm parked right around here somewhere.
00:57:27.069,00:57:29.780,Hold it. Just go!
00:57:29.821,00:57:32.866,"Steven, tell them."
00:57:32.908,00:57:35.452,We're way past leaving now.
00:57:35.493,00:57:36.745,Come on.
00:57:43.001,00:57:53.637,"I wanna funk Oh-ho, yes!"
00:57:53.678,00:57:56.056,"This is a bit mad, isn't it?"
00:57:56.098,00:57:59.101,We'll hide out in here.
00:57:59.143,00:58:01.103,"Hey, keep an eye out for blanks."
00:58:01.145,00:58:03.230,You got it.
00:58:13.615,00:58:16.618,Why didn't you say anything?
00:58:16.660,00:58:18.620,About what you said in the garden.
00:58:18.662,00:58:21.290,I always wanted to.
00:58:21.332,00:58:23.250,I just-- never seemed like the right moment.
00:58:23.292,00:58:25.127,Something always got in the way.
00:58:25.169,00:58:27.254,Here you go!
00:58:27.296,00:58:28.839,Hmm?
00:58:30.048,00:58:31.300,Steven?
00:58:31.342,00:58:34.594,No!
00:58:35.679,00:58:38.432,Please.
00:58:38.474,00:58:40.934,"-It's me, you numpty."
00:58:40.976,00:58:44.438,I knew seeing your faces again would spell trouble!
00:58:44.480,00:58:46.482,Wait. How do I know it's really you?
00:58:46.523,00:58:51.778,Because I'm the only one who's going to tell you the truth about Newton Haven.
00:58:51.820,00:58:56.325,"Now, do you recall the events of the evening Of June the 22nd, 1990?"
00:58:56.367,00:58:58.660,No.
00:59:01.579,00:59:03.790,Here you go.
00:59:03.832,00:59:05.750,See anyone we know?
00:59:09.754,00:59:11.631,Whoa!
00:59:11.673,00:59:13.591,The marmalade sandwich!
00:59:19.597,00:59:22.809,-They look good!
00:59:22.851,00:59:25.145,-It's the lights.
00:59:25.187,00:59:27.105,It's the drink.
00:59:30.359,00:59:32.403,Who cares what it Is?
00:59:33.778,00:59:37.449,Steven? Steven.
00:59:38.367,00:59:39.826,That was the night they arrived.
00:59:39.868,00:59:42.204,Remember the shooting star?
00:59:42.246,00:59:43.830,Nothing happened at first.
00:59:43.872,00:59:47.209,"They were getting ready, burrowing in underground."
00:59:47.251,00:59:50.254,"Not long after you lot left, people started to change."
00:59:50.295,00:59:52.339,Just one or two at first.
00:59:52.381,00:59:56.093,"They replaced people of influence, taking over the institutions."
00:59:56.134,00:59:59.430,"Remaking, remodeling, refurbishing."
00:59:59.471,01:00:02.057,Doing everything they could to make us join them!
01:00:09.106,01:00:11.942,I can't find Steven.
01:00:11.983,01:00:15.112,"Well, where are the others?"
01:00:17.822,01:00:19.783,"Oh, crumbs!"
01:00:19.824,01:00:22.744,It's not like the replacements were evil.
01:00:22.786,01:00:25.205,People got a lot friendlier.
01:00:25.247,01:00:26.873,That's how they do it.
01:00:26.915,01:00:30.127,It's not an invasion.
01:00:30.168,01:00:33.380,"They don't want to get rid of us, not if they can help it."
01:00:33.422,01:00:42.598,"They just want to make us more like them-- Change the way we think, bring us into line with all the others, become another link in their chain."
01:00:42.639,01:00:45.559,"Which is fine, unless you say no."
01:00:45.601,01:00:47.978,That's when you get replaced.
01:00:48.019,01:00:51.565,"Once they get your D.N.A., they've got you."
01:00:51.607,01:00:54.485,Any way they like.
01:00:51.607,01:00:59.573,"Blood tests, the nit nurse, sweat, kissing, saliva on the rim of a glass."
01:00:59.615,01:01:01.741,Why do you think I drink with this crazy straw?
01:01:01.783,01:01:03.368,"Not so crazy now, is it?"
01:01:03.410,01:01:06.997,"If you're not on their side, they'll create a version that is."
01:01:07.038,01:01:11.084,They can bring you back exactly the same or even make you young again.
01:01:11.126,01:01:13.086,It looks like you.
01:01:13.128,01:01:16.173,"But really, it's just a vessel to spread their message."
01:01:16.214,01:01:24.014,"Trust, love, respect, desire-- Replaced in the name of progress."
01:01:24.055,01:01:26.099,So what happens to the people that get replaced?
01:01:26.141,01:01:27.643,The empties?
01:01:27.684,01:01:29.645,Don't ask me what happens to them.
01:01:29.686,01:01:32.689,-Why?
01:01:32.730,01:01:35.025,"Go. Get out, before it's too late."
01:01:39.196,01:01:40.322,Basil?
01:01:40.364,01:01:42.574,I said go!
01:01:45.369,01:01:47.120,This just can't be good.
01:01:47.162,01:01:49.914,"Sam, who was the boy that you liked in sixth form?"
01:01:51.041,01:01:53.377,Adrian Keane. Why?
01:01:53.418,01:01:55.629,"Oh, he's over there."
01:02:04.388,01:02:07.098,"Hey, Sam."
01:02:10.394,01:02:11.853,Steven!
01:02:11.895,01:02:13.522,We have to get out of here!
01:02:13.564,01:02:15.399,Where are the others?
01:02:17.442,01:02:18.943,"Oh, fuck!"
01:02:21.029,01:02:23.532,-Gary!
01:02:23.574,01:02:25.492,Gary!
01:02:25.534,01:02:27.827,-Don't be so judgmental.
01:02:25.534,01:02:31.415,"-Oh, for fuck-- -Come on!"
01:02:31.456,01:02:34.000,Still got it.
01:02:34.042,01:02:36.044,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:02:36.086,01:02:37.921,Where are you all going?
01:02:37.962,01:02:40.048,We're leaving.
01:02:40.090,01:02:42.008,Adrian Keane was in that bar.
01:02:42.050,01:02:43.552,I thought you liked Adrian Keane.
01:02:43.594,01:02:45.303,Adrian Keane's dead.
01:02:45.345,01:02:48.098,Adrian Keane died in a motorbike accident in Italy eight years ago.
01:02:48.139,01:02:50.225,-Did he?
01:02:50.267,01:02:52.102,That's how they were able to replicate him.
01:02:52.143,01:02:54.229,"They know how to get to us, man."
01:02:54.271,01:02:56.565,They didn't know Adrian was dead.
01:02:56.607,01:02:59.317,They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform.
01:02:59.359,01:03:02.613,-Hey! Who wouldn't?
01:03:02.654,01:03:05.282,We gotta get out of town.
01:03:05.323,01:03:07.117,getting all this from?
01:03:07.158,01:03:10.537,"Oh, mad Basil?"
01:03:10.579,01:03:12.247,"Another good name for the band, Steve."
01:03:12.289,01:03:14.583,Y-you're putting our lives in the hands of a crazy old man.
01:03:14.625,01:03:16.251,He's not crazy!
01:03:16.293,01:03:21.131,Or maybe he's a blank trying to lure us to the edge of town Onto those dark country roads where they can deal with us.
01:03:21.172,01:03:23.967,"Yeah, we could end up dead in a field."
01:03:24.008,01:03:26.762,Yes. My thoughts precisely.
01:03:26.803,01:03:29.139,Steven's right.
01:03:29.180,01:03:32.267,"Look, we are going to the beehive! Gary's plan is still the best we have."
01:03:32.309,01:03:34.060,Wait a minute.
01:03:36.313,01:03:40.609,1990-model Oliver was out of commission by this point in the evening.
01:03:40.651,01:03:42.694,What are you saying?
01:03:43.654,01:03:45.280,I like the new you!
01:03:45.322,01:03:46.990,Oh.
01:03:47.031,01:03:50.160,"Oh, this is a mistake, isn't it?"
01:03:50.201,01:03:51.787,Just stick with me.
01:03:51.828,01:03:54.665,Andy! Come on.
01:03:54.706,01:03:56.667,Here we go.
01:03:56.708,01:03:58.376,"Fuck, yeah!"
01:03:58.418,01:04:01.004,"That's the spirit, Pete."
01:04:01.045,01:04:02.798,Who is this guy?
01:04:02.839,01:04:06.092,Come on. Andy!
01:04:08.970,01:04:10.305,You what?
01:04:10.347,01:04:12.557,We can't start without you.
01:04:16.978,01:04:19.523,"Now, then, whose round is it?"
01:04:19.564,01:04:21.191,It's mine.
01:04:22.818,01:04:24.778,Mr. Shepherd?
01:04:24.820,01:04:26.863,Why don't you kids join me?
01:04:26.904,01:04:28.990,You look like you could do with a drink.
01:04:30.492,01:04:35.330,"Now, let's have a little chat About your future, shall we, hmm?"
01:04:35.372,01:04:37.332,"Uh, Mr. Shepherd."
01:04:37.374,01:04:38.750,Call me guy.
01:04:40.084,01:04:43.463,All right-- Guy.
01:04:48.760,01:04:50.679,Are you a robot?
01:04:50.721,01:04:52.806,Does anyone know what robot means?
01:04:52.848,01:04:54.474,"Uh, yeah, I do."
01:04:54.516,01:04:56.518,"Uh, it means slave."
01:04:56.560,01:04:58.687,"Oh. Very good, Gary."
01:04:58.729,01:05:00.564,"Are you a robot, Sir?"
01:05:00.605,01:05:02.899,"No, Peter, of course I'm not a robot."
01:05:02.940,01:05:04.693,"Uh, Sir?"
01:05:04.735,01:05:06.570,But you're on their side though.
01:05:06.611,01:05:08.739,"This is not about sides, Steven."
01:05:08.780,01:05:11.700,It's not about shirts versus skins.
01:05:11.742,01:05:15.078,It's about working together as one team.
01:05:15.119,01:05:21.334,"I know it may seem a bit weird and a little bit scary, but please believe me, it's quite the opposite."
01:05:21.376,01:05:26.840,"They're here to help, to straighten us out, to prepare us for the big league."
01:05:26.882,01:05:30.343,They've seen something in us-- a potential.
01:05:30.385,01:05:37.893,"There's a vast community of worlds up there, living together peacefully, cooperatively."
01:05:37.934,01:05:40.812,And guess what.
01:05:42.606,01:05:44.441,"Pretty cool, eh, gang?"
01:05:44.482,01:05:47.068,"So, uh, they're not here to harm us?"
01:05:47.110,01:05:50.280,"Oh, far from it, O-Man, no."
01:05:50.321,01:05:51.948,They're here to help.
01:05:51.989,01:05:54.910,I'm not saying they're afraid to get tough.
01:05:54.951,01:05:58.037,I've certainly had to get tough with you in my day.
01:05:58.079,01:06:01.082,"And what one amongst you wouldn't thank me for it, hmm?"
01:06:01.124,01:06:04.795,"In some respect, they're a lot like teachers."
01:06:04.836,01:06:07.380,"Stern, yes."
01:06:07.422,01:06:09.424,A little frightening.
01:06:09.466,01:06:11.551,But it's all for our betterment.
01:06:11.593,01:06:17.599,"So, what do you say We all go somewhere and talk about this properly?"
01:06:17.641,01:06:20.435,-That wasn't properly?
01:06:20.477,01:06:24.898,What Mr. Shepherd is trying to say is that-- Whoa!
01:06:24.940,01:06:27.818,"Andy, what the fuck?"
01:06:27.859,01:06:30.320,"Yes, Andy, what the fuck?"
01:06:30.361,01:06:34.073,-W.T.F.!
01:06:34.115,01:06:35.909,Humans.
01:06:35.951,01:06:38.995,You leave us no recourse.
01:06:39.036,01:06:46.586,"If you will not join us willingly, we will be forced to use other means of persuasion."
01:06:46.628,01:06:57.388,"Now, please-- I fucking hate this town!"
01:07:11.695,01:07:13.446,Must help.
01:07:38.262,01:07:40.431,"Oh, crumbs!"
01:07:46.938,01:07:48.899,"Oh, crumbs, you're heavy."
01:08:13.423,01:08:15.132,Motherfucker!
01:08:34.945,01:08:36.237,-Andy!
01:08:36.279,01:08:37.989,"-Twist the melon, man!"
01:08:39.783,01:08:42.493,-Yeah!
01:08:43.995,01:08:45.371,-Sam.
01:08:45.413,01:08:47.832,This is no way for a family to behave.
01:08:56.800,01:08:58.802,"Sam, I'm disappointed in you."
01:08:58.843,01:09:07.226,Let me-- O-man!
01:09:22.033,01:09:24.869,"Okay, Andy, break it up."
01:09:26.830,01:09:29.165,It doesn't have to be like this.
01:09:29.206,01:09:35.922,"It could be so much simpler, so completely painless."
01:09:35.964,01:09:38.299,If only you'd see the light.
01:09:38.341,01:09:39.425,Yes.
01:09:39.467,01:09:43.387,"You see, it's not about conflict."
01:09:45.056,01:09:46.808,It's about togetherness.
01:09:46.850,01:09:48.643,Yes.
01:09:48.685,01:09:51.688,"Let's try this again, shall we?"
01:09:51.729,01:09:53.773,Nah.
01:09:53.815,01:09:56.359,We're done here.
01:09:56.400,01:09:57.819,"Yes, Gary."
01:09:57.861,01:09:59.863,That appears to be the case.
01:10:01.364,01:10:02.866,-The smokehouse!
01:10:02.907,01:10:04.701,Just do it!
01:10:04.742,01:10:06.452,Come on!
01:10:06.494,01:10:07.537,This way!
01:10:17.421,01:10:20.216,"Humans, this is your final warning."
01:10:24.929,01:10:27.515,"Humans, obey now, or face the consequences."
01:10:31.435,01:10:33.604,Let's go!
01:10:41.738,01:10:43.239,"Oh, shit."
01:10:43.280,01:10:45.449,"Oh, look, there's my car!"
01:10:47.284,01:10:49.079,Let's climb down the drainpipe.
01:10:49.120,01:10:51.455,I got a better idea.
01:10:54.584,01:10:56.544,Climb down the drainpipe.
01:11:00.381,01:11:02.217,"-Okay, just go."
01:11:02.258,01:11:03.718,"Leave it with me, okay?"
01:11:03.760,01:11:06.054,Are you sure?
01:11:06.096,01:11:08.056,"I don't know if that's true, Gary."
01:11:08.098,01:11:09.348,J-just go.
01:11:09.390,01:11:11.726,Will you find out what happened to my brother?
01:11:11.768,01:11:12.936,"Yeah, course. Course."
01:11:12.977,01:11:15.188,"And I-I'll look after Stevie for you, eh?"
01:11:16.147,01:11:18.942,He's a good guy.
01:11:18.983,01:11:21.861,"Gary, you're not a bad person."
01:11:21.903,01:11:23.821,But you're not boyfriend material.
01:11:23.905,01:11:30.411,"You know, the whole free spirit, quick one in the disabled toilets thing, I-it's kind of cool when you're 17, but not when you're facing 40."
01:11:30.453,01:11:33.623,"There comes a time you have to go forwards, not backwards."
01:11:35.792,01:11:38.920,"maybe if I hadn't left you behind that night, things would all be different."
01:11:38.962,01:11:41.505,"It's not all about that night, Gary."
01:11:42.465,01:11:45.218,-Isn't it?
01:11:47.428,01:11:49.346,"We'll always have the disabled's though, won't we?"
01:11:50.473,01:11:51.599,Yeah.
01:11:51.641,01:11:54.269,"Yeah, we'll always have the disabled's."
01:12:15.331,01:12:16.833,"Oh, no!"
01:12:28.594,01:12:31.514,Where's Sam?
01:12:31.555,01:12:34.391,-You did what?
01:12:34.433,01:12:37.645,You just sent away the-the only one of us sober enough to drive?
01:12:37.687,01:12:39.314,Yeah.
01:12:39.355,01:12:41.524,You just couldn't stand the fact that she might prefer me to you.
01:12:41.565,01:12:43.400,That's not true.
01:12:43.442,01:12:45.528,I was getting somewhere.
01:12:45.569,01:12:48.323,-I was just trying to help.
01:12:48.364,01:12:51.075,"Jesus! I do something right for a change, and you fuckers get on my case."
01:12:51.117,01:12:54.787,"Wow, that is the first time I've ever heard you admit being wrong."
01:12:54.829,01:12:57.581,-I said I did something right.
01:12:57.623,01:12:59.334,So?
01:12:59.375,01:13:01.127,-Not necessarily.
01:13:01.169,01:13:03.254,-Shh!
01:13:01.169,01:13:05.006,"-Look, I just thought it was best To keep her out of harm's way."
01:13:05.048,01:13:07.300,"What about us, Gary?"
01:13:07.342,01:13:09.927,"We're all right, Pete."
01:13:09.969,01:13:12.555,"No, we're the Four Musketeers!"
01:13:14.015,01:13:15.766,Wait.
01:13:15.808,01:13:18.228,How do we know you put her in the car?
01:13:18.269,01:13:20.063,How do we know you're you?
01:13:20.104,01:13:21.231,Of course I'm me.
01:13:21.272,01:13:22.940,"But who the fuck are you, Gary?"
01:13:22.982,01:13:26.027,I'm Gary King.
01:13:26.069,01:13:29.197,-How do I know you guys are you?
01:13:29.239,01:13:31.032,"Well, you might all not be you."
01:13:31.074,01:13:34.327,-How did you know O-Man wasn't O-Man?
01:13:34.369,01:13:38.164,What does that prove?
01:13:38.206,01:13:41.167,That's why he had his birthmark.
01:13:41.209,01:13:43.044,Like a man-baby.
01:13:43.086,01:13:45.338,Oliver with none of the shit that had happened to the real Oliver.
01:13:45.380,01:13:47.423,No laser surgery.
01:13:47.464,01:13:49.175,So the blanks really are just blank?
01:13:49.217,01:13:52.595,No wear and tear.
01:13:52.636,01:13:57.350,"Steven, 1987-- We were playing cricket, and I accidentally pushed you onto a broken bottle that nearly went up your ass."
01:13:57.392,01:13:58.851,-So?
01:14:04.399,01:14:05.900,Very Nice.
01:14:05.942,01:14:08.778,"Pete, you got that 50 c.c. Suzuki in 1988."
01:14:08.819,01:14:11.614,"You let me have a go on it, and I ran over your leg."
01:14:13.116,01:14:15.785,-What the fuck?
01:14:18.996,01:14:23.751,"Andy, in 1986 we reenacted the knife game from Aliens, and I stabbed you in the middle finger."
01:14:23.793,01:14:42.728,"How about December, 1997, when you O.D.'D, and I drove you to the hospital four times over the limit, and I ended up rolling the car And almost severing my femoral artery, at which point you made a miraculous fucking recovery And ran off into the night, leaving me to get arrested After 12 hours of lifesaving surgery."
01:14:42.770,01:14:44.480,Either one of those will do.
01:14:46.899,01:14:48.276,Thank you.
01:14:48.318,01:14:50.111,-What about you?
01:14:52.196,01:14:53.614,That could've been drawn on.
01:14:53.656,01:14:55.532,"-Well, aren't all tattoos drawn on?"
01:14:55.574,01:14:58.286,Show us your arm.
01:14:58.328,01:15:00.537,Show us your arm.
01:15:01.372,01:15:02.623,No. No.
01:15:02.665,01:15:07.295,You fell offstage at the fifth-year ball Fucking around and dislocated your elbow.
01:15:07.337,01:15:09.839,You have got a scar where they put the metal plate in.
01:15:09.880,01:15:11.507,I don't have to show you anything!
01:15:11.548,01:15:13.717,All right?
01:15:13.759,01:15:18.931,"If I'm not me, then how do I know that carved into that beam above your head Are the words King Gary?"
01:15:18.973,01:15:22.226,-But it doesn't say King Gary.
01:15:22.268,01:15:24.187,-Doesn't it?
01:15:24.228,01:15:28.565,-It says King gay.
01:15:28.607,01:15:30.151,That was me.
01:15:30.193,01:15:32.820,King gay!
01:15:32.862,01:15:35.323,Mr. Shepherd remembered stuff.
01:15:35.365,01:15:37.867,Selective memory.
01:15:39.452,01:15:43.873,"We don't see you for years, and you just pitch up and bring us here."
01:15:43.914,01:15:46.834,You better come up with some hard evidence that you're human.
01:15:46.876,01:15:49.170,Otherwise we're gonna find out for ourselves.
01:15:50.421,01:15:51.922,You want evidence?
01:15:53.383,01:15:55.009,There.
01:15:59.972,01:16:02.350,-That proves I'm human.
01:16:02.392,01:16:04.643,Exactly. Ow!
01:16:04.685,01:16:06.270,It's Gary.
01:16:09.357,01:16:11.192,The whole town's out looking for us.
01:16:11.234,01:16:14.987,That's a good thing.
01:16:15.029,01:16:19.367,"Gary, wait! Fuck!"
01:16:19.409,01:16:23.329,"Gary! Gary, what do you mean nobody's inside?"
01:16:23.371,01:16:25.831,We can still do this.
01:16:25.873,01:16:27.417,We're still on the crawl!
01:16:30.211,01:16:31.587,King gay.
01:16:31.628,01:16:34.048,Peter?
01:16:34.090,01:16:36.175,Peter.
01:16:38.219,01:16:40.430,I thought that was you.
01:16:40.471,01:16:43.849,-You okay?
01:16:43.891,01:16:46.602,I know we didn't see eye-to-eye at school.
01:16:46.643,01:16:49.230,Goodness knows I regret that.
01:16:49.272,01:16:54.402,"I wanted to say something back at the pub, but I felt so terribly ashamed by what I'd done."
01:16:54.444,01:16:57.572,"Let me make it up to you, Peter."
01:16:57.613,01:16:59.115,Please?
01:17:01.242,01:17:03.702,"Gary, you're out of your mind!"
01:17:03.744,01:17:05.746,It's fucking suicide.
01:17:05.788,01:17:09.917,We are gonna get to the world's end if it kills us.
01:17:09.959,01:17:12.462,-Where's Pete?
01:17:12.503,01:17:13.712,You fucking bastard!
01:17:13.754,01:17:16.090,-I hate you!
01:17:16.132,01:17:18.259,"Why are you doing this, Peter?"
01:17:18.301,01:17:19.802,We don't want to hurt you.
01:17:19.843,01:17:22.597,"-Come on, mate, it's not worth it!"
01:17:22.638,01:17:24.932,"Yes, it fucking Is!"
01:17:26.809,01:17:29.228,"-Oh, shit."
01:17:29.270,01:17:31.272,Peter.
01:17:31.314,01:17:32.773,Pete!
01:17:32.815,01:17:35.318,"-Pete, come on!"
01:17:35.359,01:17:39.822,"-I must say-- I'm very disappointed in you, Peter."
01:17:44.494,01:17:45.953,Punch their fucking lights out!
01:17:45.995,01:17:48.998,"Andy, no, no, no."
01:17:55.588,01:17:57.423,-Pete.
01:18:08.476,01:18:10.102,-Pete.
01:18:10.144,01:18:11.728,Gary's right.
01:18:11.770,01:18:14.190,Exactly. What?
01:18:14.231,01:18:16.233,We are not going to the King's head!
01:18:16.275,01:18:19.529,We're done!
01:18:16.275,01:18:21.280,We're gonna do what we should've done in the first place-- Get the beast and get out of here.
01:18:21.322,01:18:24.033,"We are fucking leaving, and we are never coming back."
01:18:25.117,01:18:29.788,"Now, you can either come with us willingly, or I'm gonna knock you the fuck out and carry you there myself."
01:18:29.830,01:18:32.291,-You choose!
01:18:32.333,01:18:36.003,"Just think about what you're saying, you know?"
01:18:36.045,01:18:37.171,You fuck!
01:18:54.647,01:18:56.399,Shit. It's those fucking kids.
01:18:56.440,01:18:58.025,"Oh, not them again."
01:19:02.779,01:19:05.032,What the hell is that?
01:19:05.074,01:19:07.326,"I don't know, but it's definitely not modern art."
01:19:16.126,01:19:19.255,"Oh, shit, we are trapped."
01:19:19.296,01:19:23.050,Where's the beast?
01:19:23.092,01:19:24.760,The beast is on the next street.
01:19:24.801,01:19:27.054,How are we gonna get to it?
01:19:27.096,01:19:29.765,Through where?
01:19:31.141,01:19:32.768,Number ten.
01:19:36.564,01:19:38.023,Come on.
01:19:38.065,01:19:39.525,"Quick, quick."
01:19:39.567,01:19:42.027,Let's go.
01:19:42.069,01:19:44.113,The back door. Back door.
01:19:45.364,01:19:46.990,Here we go.
01:19:49.243,01:19:51.245,"-Okay, there it is."
01:19:51.287,01:19:54.039,Shit! Okay.
01:19:54.081,01:19:56.375,"We wait for an opening, and then we leg it to the beast."
01:19:56.417,01:19:58.085,We need the keys.
01:20:00.546,01:20:02.047,Gary?
01:20:04.091,01:20:05.426,Gary.
01:20:05.468,01:20:07.303,What are you doing?
01:20:07.344,01:20:08.929,Just a little toast.
01:20:08.971,01:20:12.141,"Gary, put the pint down, yeah?"
01:20:12.182,01:20:18.063,"To Oliver, Pete, and to us."
01:20:18.105,01:20:20.441,"You know, 'cause ten pubs isn't bad."
01:20:20.483,01:20:22.901,It's not.
01:20:22.943,01:20:24.403,But we're calling time.
01:20:26.489,01:20:28.115,Okay.
01:20:44.465,01:20:46.133,So close.
01:20:47.635,01:20:50.137,Number ten.
01:20:50.179,01:20:51.639,Okay.
01:20:51.681,01:20:53.974,So close.
01:20:58.979,01:21:01.565,"Mmm, no, no, no, no, no."
01:21:01.607,01:21:03.776,Gary.
01:21:03.818,01:21:05.319,Gary! Gary!
01:21:05.361,01:21:06.903,Let him go.
01:21:06.945,01:21:09.532,"-He left you, man!"
01:21:10.700,01:21:12.326,Andy!
01:21:22.419,01:21:24.338,Gary! Gary!
01:21:27.383,01:21:30.427,"Gary, come back!"
01:21:54.034,01:21:56.328,Gary! Gary!
01:21:56.370,01:21:59.373,Gary. Gary!
01:22:21.437,01:22:23.898,"-Andy, look out!"
01:22:40.956,01:22:42.792,Come on!
01:22:42.833,01:22:49.548,-What the-- Get in!
01:22:49.590,01:22:50.841,Get in!
01:22:50.883,01:22:53.886,"Gary, Andy, get the fuck in!"
01:22:53.928,01:22:56.764,"You heard him, Andy!"
01:22:56.806,01:22:58.682,We haven't much time!
01:23:09.401,01:23:11.737,"Andy, go now!"
01:23:11.779,01:23:13.739,Steven!
01:23:13.781,01:23:14.949,Go!
01:23:34.802,01:23:39.348,"Andy, I want you inside me."
01:23:40.432,01:23:41.350,Okay.
01:23:47.356,01:23:48.649,Cheers.
01:24:08.168,01:24:09.795,-No!
01:24:09.837,01:24:12.339,-You've had enough!
01:24:12.381,01:24:14.591,-I know!
01:24:14.633,01:24:17.135,Stop this now!
01:24:17.177,01:24:19.680,Leave me alone.
01:24:19.722,01:24:21.473,Of course I fucking care!
01:24:21.515,01:24:23.475,There is a reason I'm angry at you.
01:24:23.517,01:24:25.477,"Oh, God. I know why you're angry at me, okay?"
01:24:25.519,01:24:28.271,But it's not my fault that you crashed that car!
01:24:28.313,01:24:31.483,That's not the point!
01:24:31.525,01:24:34.319,You were Gary King.
01:24:34.361,01:24:37.155,I would have followed you to the end.
01:24:37.197,01:24:38.782,I-- I fucking have!
01:24:38.824,01:24:41.159,-Then stop following me!
01:24:46.248,01:24:49.043,No! It's just one more!
01:24:50.002,01:24:52.796,Let me have this!
01:24:52.838,01:24:54.423,You've got everything you want!
01:24:54.464,01:24:57.300,What are you talking about?
01:24:54.464,01:24:59.595,"Oh, you've got your perfect job And your perfect house and your perfect wife!"
01:24:59.636,01:25:02.556,You think it's so perfect?
01:25:03.432,01:25:05.684,"She left me, Gary."
01:25:05.726,01:25:08.144,She took the kids to her mum's three weeks ago.
01:25:08.186,01:25:09.939,She said I'm not present enough.
01:25:09.980,01:25:13.067,"I am trying to win her back, and God knows I am losing."
01:25:13.108,01:25:18.280,"But I will continue to fight, because that is how we survive!"
01:25:18.321,01:25:22.492,"For fuck's sake, Gary, I just punched my wedding ring out of a robot's tummy!"
01:25:22.534,01:25:25.037,Exactly!
01:25:25.079,01:25:29.041,-What is so important about The Golden Mile?
01:25:29.083,01:25:30.960,Gary!
01:25:34.755,01:25:36.715,Aaah!
01:25:51.438,01:25:53.857,"-You need help, Gary."
01:25:55.358,01:25:58.112,You know what help was?
01:25:58.153,01:26:02.324,"Help was a lot of people sitting in a circle, talking about how fucking awful things had got."
01:26:02.365,01:26:05.828,That is not my idea of a good time.
01:26:05.869,01:26:08.872,They told me when to go to bed!
01:26:08.914,01:26:10.666,Me!
01:26:10.707,01:26:16.379,"Gary, mate, how can you tell when you're drunk if you're never sober?"
01:26:16.421,01:26:18.507,-I don't wanna be sober!
01:26:19.466,01:26:22.594,It never got better than that night.
01:26:22.636,01:26:25.388,That was supposed to be the beginning of my life!
01:26:25.430,01:26:28.475,All that promise and fucking optimism.
01:26:28.517,01:26:31.770,That feeling like we could take on the whole universe!
01:26:32.771,01:26:35.899,It was a big lie.
01:26:35.941,01:26:37.943,Nothing happened!
01:26:37.985,01:26:40.154,"You don't need to do this, Gary."
01:26:43.281,01:26:45.617,"Yeah, I do."
01:26:48.871,01:26:51.165,Please stand by.
01:26:51.206,01:26:54.668,- Please stand by.
01:26:55.961,01:26:58.463,Please stand by.
01:27:00.340,01:27:02.258,Please stand by.
01:27:06.972,01:27:30.370,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
01:27:34.750,01:27:39.755,Gary. Gary. Gary.
01:27:39.796,01:27:43.299,Gary. Gary. Gary.
01:27:43.341,01:27:48.680,Gary. Gary. Gary.
01:27:48.722,01:27:51.600,What are you doing?
01:27:51.641,01:27:54.895,Gary King.
01:27:54.937,01:27:56.396,Yeah?
01:27:59.649,01:28:03.070,Gary King of the humans?
01:28:03.112,01:28:04.780,Yeah.
01:28:04.821,01:28:12.204,"We are here to enable your full potential, as we have with countless worlds across the galaxy."
01:28:12.246,01:28:14.831,"Oh, yeah."
01:28:14.873,01:28:21.337,"We appropriate a small percentage of the population At 2,000 or so penetration points across the planet."
01:28:21.379,01:28:24.299,This ensures maximum coverage.
01:28:24.340,01:28:31.640,"From there, we create simulants To spread our ideologies through peaceful indoctrination."
01:28:31.681,01:28:39.189,Our objective is simple: to ready the population For participation in our galactic community.
01:28:39.231,01:28:43.610,This method requires a small sacrifice.
01:28:43.652,01:28:48.282,"But the fewer replacements we make, the more successful we consider our operation."
01:28:48.323,01:28:52.619,"Of course, we welcome those who volunteer themselves."
01:28:52.661,01:28:58.000,We can offer attractive incentives For those who willingly combine.
01:28:58.041,01:29:02.378,The chance to be young again And yet retain selected memories.
01:29:02.420,01:29:05.590,Isn't that something you'd like?
01:29:05.632,01:29:08.927,Something you've always wanted?
01:29:17.978,01:29:19.813,"Oh, my God."
01:29:19.855,01:29:21.481,I'm so cute.
01:29:21.523,01:29:26.278,The beauty of our system Is That we all win.
01:29:26.320,01:29:27.904,There are no losers.
01:29:31.241,01:29:33.576,Allow me to carry your legend forward.
01:29:34.703,01:29:38.623,Let the man you have become be the boy you were.
01:29:47.757,01:29:48.925,Nah.
01:29:50.635,01:29:54.388,There's only one Gary King!
01:29:54.430,01:30:00.478,"Then you have made your choice, Gary King of the humans."
01:30:00.520,01:30:02.396,"Yeah, I have."
01:30:02.438,01:30:07.152,"Because, frankly, who the fuck are you To come down here and tell us what to do?"
01:30:07.194,01:30:11.198,"We are the network, and we are here for your betterment."
01:30:11.240,01:30:16.661,"In the last 23 years, have you not marveled As information technology has surged forward?"
01:30:16.703,01:30:19.289,-No.
01:30:16.703,01:30:21.708,- Earth has grown smaller yet greater As connectivity has grown.
01:30:21.750,01:30:25.419,"This is our doing, and it is just the beginning."
01:30:25.461,01:30:28.006,"Oh, fuck off, you big lamp!"
01:30:28.048,01:30:31.509,You are children and you require guidance.
01:30:31.551,01:30:34.179,There is no room for imperfection.
01:30:34.221,01:30:37.682,"Hey, earth isn't perfect, all right?"
01:30:37.724,01:30:40.936,And guess what.
01:30:40.977,01:30:43.521,And therein lies the necessity for this intervention.
01:30:43.563,01:30:48.193,Must the galaxy be subjected to an entire planet of people like you?
01:30:48.235,01:30:50.112,"Whoa-- whoa, whoa."
01:30:50.153,01:30:51.571,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:30:51.613,01:30:54.366,"Who put you in charge, huh?"
01:30:54.408,01:30:56.159,Who are you to criticize anyone?
01:30:56.201,01:30:59.288,"Now, y-you might think Gary is a bit of a cock."
01:30:59.329,01:31:01.539,And-and he is a bit of a cock.
01:31:01.581,01:31:03.457,-But he's my cock!
01:31:03.499,01:31:08.297,"But he is a detriment to himself, just as earth is a detriment to the galaxy."
01:31:08.338,01:31:10.299,Wh-what did-- what'd you say?
01:31:10.340,01:31:13.760,You act out the same cycles of self-destruction again and again.
01:31:13.802,01:31:18.890,"At this point, your planet is the least civilized in the entire galaxy."
01:31:18.932,01:31:22.060,What did he say?
01:31:22.102,01:31:25.814,Hey! It is our basic human right to be fuck-ups!
01:31:25.855,01:31:28.442,This civilization was founded on fuck-ups!
01:31:28.482,01:31:31.069,And you know what?
01:31:31.111,01:31:32.570,"Yeah, and me!"
01:31:32.612,01:31:35.824,What is it they say?
01:31:32.612,01:31:38.701,To err is-- To err is human.
01:31:38.743,01:31:44.374,"So, uh-- We do not believe you speak for all humanity."
01:31:44.416,01:31:47.377,You are but two men.
01:31:47.419,01:31:50.255,Three drunk men!
01:31:50.297,01:31:52.299,Stevie!
01:31:54.426,01:31:56.219,- Enough!
01:31:56.261,01:31:58.263,"Enough, humans!"
01:31:58.305,01:32:00.598,"Oh, you are in trouble now."
01:32:00.640,01:32:03.435,It's only the fucking three Musketeers.
01:32:03.477,01:32:07.189,You are revolting against the wisdom of countless solar systems.
01:32:07.230,01:32:08.731,"Yeah, we are revolting."
01:32:08.773,01:32:11.276,Wait. You just said you're not here to conquer.
01:32:11.318,01:32:15.529,Can I just ask-- how many people did you have to replace in Newton Haven?
01:32:15.571,01:32:17.407,That is irrelevant.
01:32:17.449,01:32:18.616,Hands up.
01:32:18.658,01:32:22.578,Who here is human?
01:32:22.620,01:32:23.955,I'm human.
01:32:23.997,01:32:25.123,One!
01:32:25.165,01:32:27.459,-And me.
01:32:27.501,01:32:30.212,I am.
01:32:30.253,01:32:31.545,-Shh.
01:32:31.587,01:32:33.340,"So, what's that, three?"
01:32:33.382,01:32:36.759,-You had to replace an entire town.
01:32:36.801,01:32:40.013,"Well, everybody apart from old nutball and the shifty twins."
01:32:40.055,01:32:42.891,That's a good name for a band.
01:32:42.932,01:32:45.477,"What about the ones you replaced, like Peter and Oliver?"
01:32:45.519,01:32:47.979,Yeah!
01:32:48.021,01:32:49.814,I told you not to ask that.
01:32:49.856,01:32:57.113,"Redundant vessels are recycled, mulched and converted into fertilizer, whereupon they are returned to the earth to promote verdancy and growth."
01:32:57.155,01:32:59.782,It is a highly efficient means of organic renewal.
01:32:59.824,01:33:01.575,Mulched?
01:33:01.617,01:33:03.912,It is a relative few in the light of our long-term plan.
01:33:03.953,01:33:07.290,You mean a few hundred thousand turned to fucking compost!
01:33:07.332,01:33:09.792,What about the other places-- the penetration points?
01:33:09.834,01:33:12.212,Are they as successful as Newton Haven?
01:33:12.254,01:33:15.340,"Because, um, I'm guessing we're not the only glitch in your system."
01:33:15.382,01:33:19.302,"It is true, the network has been experiencing some difficulties."
01:33:19.344,01:33:22.514,"I think you bit off more than you can chew with earth, mate."
01:33:22.556,01:33:27.102,"Yeah, 'cause we are more belligerent, more stubborn and more idiotic than you can possibly imagine."
01:33:27.143,01:33:29.187,And I am not just talking about Gary.
01:33:29.229,01:33:31.481,"-Yeah, there's more than one Gary King!"
01:33:29.229,01:33:33.733,- But you said-- I fucking know what I fucking said!
01:33:33.775,01:33:37.987,Your reliance on profanity is a measure of your immaturity As a man and as a species!
01:33:38.029,01:33:42.576,"Why don't you just get in your rocket And fuck off back to Legoland, you cunts?"
01:33:42.616,01:33:45.995,"Yeah! Stop fucking starbucking us, man!"
01:33:46.037,01:33:47.997,It's our duty to challenge you!
01:33:48.039,01:33:50.917,"Just leave us to our own devices, you intergalactic asshole."
01:33:50.959,01:33:52.502,- You misunderstand!
01:33:52.544,01:33:54.337,- We are trying-- -Nobody's listening!
01:33:54.379,01:33:56.339,- If you don't leave-- -Face it!
01:33:56.381,01:34:01.094,"We are the human race, and we don't like being told what to do!"
01:34:02.929,01:34:05.098,Just what is it that you want to do?
01:34:05.932,01:34:08.059,We want to be free!
01:34:08.101,01:34:11.187,We want to be free to do what we wanna do!
01:34:11.229,01:34:12.814,We wanna get loaded!
01:34:12.855,01:34:14.857,And we wanna have a good time.
01:34:14.899,01:34:17.026,And that's what we're gonna do.
01:34:18.111,01:34:20.822,It's pointless arguing with you.
01:34:20.863,01:34:24.742,You will be left to your own devices.
01:34:24.784,01:34:27.329,-Really?
01:34:27.370,01:34:28.704,Fuck it.
01:34:37.755,01:34:39.382,They fucked off!
01:34:41.343,01:34:43.553,Yea! Whoo-hoo!
01:34:43.595,01:34:46.473,"Yes, yes, yes!"
01:34:46.515,01:34:48.808,Up yours! Up yours!
01:34:48.850,01:34:52.187,-Yeah! We did it!
01:34:52.228,01:34:53.438,We won!
01:34:56.732,01:34:59.944,Gary! Let's move!
01:35:02.738,01:35:05.534,"Yeah, it's shit here, isn't it?"
01:35:06.700,01:35:08.453,Boys!
01:35:08.495,01:35:10.788,Up here! Go!
01:35:12.081,01:35:14.209,Come on! Go!
01:35:15.293,01:35:16.336,Come on!
01:35:32.726,01:35:34.396,Well done!
01:35:34.437,01:35:36.606,Thanks a bunch.
01:35:36.648,01:35:38.692,Yeah. Happy now?
01:35:39.651,01:35:41.444,"Basil, what do we do now?"
01:35:41.486,01:35:43.196,Same as before.
01:35:43.655,01:35:45.657,Go!
01:35:49.494,01:35:51.496,Where's the beast?
01:35:51.538,01:35:53.081,"The beast's dead, mate."
01:35:53.122,01:35:56.792,You know what-- you know what is really annoying?
01:35:56.834,01:36:00.796,What?
01:36:00.838,01:36:03.841,You're not gonna.
01:36:04.842,01:36:06.720,I think our luck just changed.
01:36:06.760,01:36:08.096,Whoo-hoo!
01:36:09.681,01:36:11.641,Ow!
01:36:11.683,01:36:13.435,Sorry!
01:36:13.476,01:36:16.229,-Yes.
01:36:16.271,01:36:18.940,"Yes, I did."
01:36:18.981,01:36:21.109,"Oi, Sam!"
01:36:21.150,01:36:23.194,"Can you give us a lift to London, please?"
01:36:23.236,01:36:25.863,Did you find out what happened to my brother?
01:36:28.157,01:36:30.285,"Oh, sorry about the mess."
01:36:30.326,01:36:32.370,-We forgive you. Let's go!
01:36:33.371,01:36:35.707,Backwards!
01:36:55.518,01:36:57.145,Which way now?
01:36:57.895,01:36:59.731,Go straight over!
01:37:17.540,01:37:19.833,We can make it!
01:37:21.419,01:37:23.921,We're gonna make it!
01:37:30.219,01:37:31.929,We made it!
01:38:32.240,01:38:34.116,I'm sorry.
01:38:37.328,01:38:38.996,I know.
01:38:40.164,01:38:41.957,I know.
01:38:41.999,01:38:45.754,Everyone remembers where they were When the lights went out on planet earth.
01:38:45.795,01:38:51.092,"Me, Gary, Steven and Sam-- We were standing right by the switch."
01:38:51.133,01:38:54.637,I guess it was a big night for everyone.
01:38:54.679,01:38:59.183,That morning gave a whole new meaning to the word hangover.
01:38:59.225,01:39:04.272,"We decided to walk it off, all the way back to London."
01:39:04.313,01:39:08.359,But the headache didn't end there.
01:39:08.401,01:39:11.529,Talk about the big smoke.
01:39:13.030,01:39:28.546,"When the network went down, it triggered some Kind of pulse, wiped out all our technology And sent us here, back to the dark ages."
01:39:29.963,01:39:31.965,"There were casualties, of course."
01:39:32.007,01:39:33.509,I knew a few of them.
01:39:33.551,01:39:38.222,"Some guy from work, cousin Paul, Gary's mum."
01:39:40.475,01:39:45.605,Nobody really knew how many we lost 'Cause we never heard from the rest of the world again.
01:39:45.647,01:39:48.190,Everyone got cut off.
01:39:48.232,01:39:51.402,"It isn't easy now, but it is simpler."
01:39:51.444,01:39:53.863,"I'm back with the wife, which is something."
01:39:53.905,01:39:57.867,We decided our problems didn't seem as bad in the grand scheme of things.
01:39:57.909,01:40:00.244,We all had to go organic in a big way.
01:40:00.286,01:40:05.249,"But if I'm honest, I'm hard- pressed to recall any processed foods I actually miss."
01:40:09.420,01:40:13.591,"As for the blanks-- well, a funny thing happened there."
01:40:13.633,01:40:15.718,They woke up.
01:40:15.760,01:40:20.974,"A week or so after the network pulled out, they just sort of rebooted by themselves."
01:40:21.014,01:40:23.016,Tried to start afresh.
01:40:24.101,01:40:28.648,They seemed lost at first-- Children cut off from their parents.
01:40:28.690,01:40:30.525,"Abandoned, forgotten."
01:40:30.566,01:40:34.403,"Looking for guidance, for someone to show them the way."
01:40:34.445,01:40:36.781,"I felt a bit sorry for them, to be honest."
01:40:36.823,01:40:42.912,The network was right about one thing-- We can be a bit uncivilized.
01:40:42.954,01:40:47.542,Maybe we would have been a bad influence on the rest of the galaxy.
01:40:47.583,01:40:50.378,Oliver went back to being an estate agent.
01:40:50.419,01:40:52.254,People still need a roof over their heads.
01:40:52.296,01:40:55.090,And the old Ollie always had a gift for the gab.
01:40:55.132,01:40:57.927,I guess the new one has too.
01:40:57.969,01:41:00.429,He's doing all right.
01:41:00.471,01:41:05.184,I hear that the Peter found its way home to Bishop's Gardens.
01:41:05.226,01:41:07.729,I suppose he picked up where the other one left off.
01:41:09.146,01:41:11.524,I'm not sure his wife noticed.
01:41:11.566,01:41:13.568,Maybe she chose not to.
01:41:13.609,01:41:16.320,"He's a pretty good dad, by all accounts."
01:41:17.947,01:41:20.700,Steven and Sam got together in the end.
01:41:20.742,01:41:22.535,Didn't see that coming.
01:41:22.577,01:41:24.913,They shacked up just outside London.
01:41:24.954,01:41:26.998,It's a pretty nice shack too.
01:41:27.623,01:41:31.961,As for Gary-- I don't know what happened to Gary.
01:41:32.003,01:41:35.924,We got separated.
01:41:35.965,01:41:40.302,"Some say he went back to Newton Haven, but I don't know why."
01:41:40.344,01:41:42.388,I think his business there was done.
01:41:43.556,01:41:47.226,"It's funny, but I miss him."
01:41:47.268,01:41:51.814,"I wonder if he misses me, misses the boys."
01:41:57.570,01:42:00.656,"Wherever he is, I hope he's happy."
01:42:00.698,01:42:04.786,That's all he ever wanted really-- to have a good time.
01:42:04.827,01:42:07.496,I just hope he found it beyond the bottom of a glass.
01:42:09.206,01:42:17.506,"Because real happiness, real friends-- Those are things worth living for, worth fighting for."
01:42:29.644,01:42:31.228,Blank bastards.
01:42:34.147,01:42:36.275,Fucking robots.
01:42:45.534,01:42:47.536,"Five waters, please."
01:42:48.997,01:42:53.334,"You can have one, but I ain't serving this scum."
01:42:53.375,01:42:56.629,"Oh, well, I'm afraid it's all for one and one for all."
01:42:56.671,01:43:00.299,"You see, my young friends and I are on an adventure, a quest, if you will."
01:43:00.341,01:43:05.721,"And since we find ourselves in need of refreshment, you, Sir, have the honor of drawing first blood."
01:43:05.763,01:43:11.727,"So I'll ask you again, for the last time."
01:43:11.769,01:43:15.064,"Five waters, please."
01:43:22.947,01:43:25.867,Who the hell do you think you are?
01:43:25.908,01:43:28.201,Me?
01:43:28.243,01:43:30.538,They call me the King.
01:44:06.157,01:44:08.784,'cause they speak.
