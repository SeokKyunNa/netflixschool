00:22:07.827,00:22:11.455,"But to increase my chances of employment, I got the E removed."
00:22:11.497,00:22:12.957,How's that working out for you?
00:22:12.999,00:22:15.209,Who doesn't like hats?
00:22:15.251,00:22:18.212,"BATS: So, Doc, how many jobs you done with the kid?"
00:22:18.254,00:22:22.382,"If you can't take my word for him, then get back in that fucking elevator."
00:22:22.424,00:22:24.677,You never heard of the Spirit of 85?
00:22:26.428,00:22:28.097,The joyrider?
00:22:28.139,00:22:31.391,The ghost that baited cops doing 130 on 85.
00:22:31.433,00:22:33.769,"Headlights off, brake lights disconnected."
00:22:33.811,00:22:36.230,He drove 'em around in circles on Spaghetti Junction.
00:22:36.272,00:22:38.941,Left 'em in the dust every time.
00:22:38.983,00:22:40.276,"Wasn't that, like, 10 years ago?"
00:22:40.318,00:22:41.861,"Well, like I said, that was our boy."
00:22:41.902,00:22:44.947,He's been boosting cars since he was old enough to see over the dash.
00:22:44.989,00:22:46.699,He stole my Mercedes.
00:22:46.740,00:22:48.575,"I watched him do it, too."
00:22:46.740,00:22:51.078,"I didn't stop him, though, 'cause I was just blinded by the balls on that kid."
00:22:51.120,00:23:01.088,"'Course he didn't know who I was, or the worth of the junk in the trunk once he dumped it, but once I tracked him down, I made sure to tell him who I was, what I was capable of, and how much he owed me."
00:23:01.130,00:23:04.508,"And since he's been paying me back, he's also shown me what he's capable of."
00:23:04.550,00:23:05.926,Wow.
00:23:05.968,00:23:09.138,I just drew a whole goddamn map in chalk while we've been standing here squawking.

00:24:08.697,00:24:11.491,You laid down your whole play.
00:24:13.035,00:24:14.161,Baby?
00:24:19.917,00:24:22.920,"The target is an armored truck at Perimeter Trust in Dunwoody, 10:00 a.m. sharp."
00:24:22.962,00:24:26.673,We have the details of the route because someone at the depot has a nasal problem.
00:24:26.715,00:24:30.677,"The bank itself is right near the Buford Highway, so we should be able to hit the ramp within 60 seconds of getting out."
00:24:30.719,00:24:32.346,We also have a diversion crew.
00:24:32.388,00:24:36.225,"They're gonna blow up a bread truck a ways away, keep the fuzz busy."

00:24:47.778,00:24:52.032,"Boost a commuter car, a family car, something that blends in well with morning traffic."
00:24:52.074,00:24:55.286,Something on the heavy side in case we need to ram the cops off the road.
00:24:55.328,00:24:58.331,"A Escalade, Yukon, Avalanche, whatever."

00:25:40.206,00:25:45.085,They snuck in when we were asleep last night and took the pants off the chair and emptied our wallets.
00:25:45.127,00:25:47.838,They got what's rightfully ours.
00:25:48.922,00:25:52.134,"Let's go get it back, what's rightfully ours."

00:38:16.711,00:38:18.004,Yeah.
00:38:18.046,00:38:19.965,"Well, then, you have us all beat."
00:38:21.174,00:38:22.884,Every damn song is about you.
00:38:22.926,00:38:26.930,We could drive back and forth across the States forever and never run out of Baby songs.
00:38:26.972,00:38:28.848,"We might run out of gas, though."
00:38:30.558,00:38:33.686,Did your mom call you Baby as a kid?
00:38:34.395,00:38:35.438,Sometimes.
00:38:35.480,00:38:38.191,She used to work here?
00:38:38.233,00:38:41.694,"Sometimes, but, uh, she was a singer, too."
00:38:42.612,00:38:44.281,What does she do now?
00:38:46.032,00:38:47.159,Nothing.
00:38:49.035,00:38:51.329,"Uh, I could find Debora if you want."
00:38:51.412,00:38:53.248,COOK: Debbie!
00:38:56.209,00:38:59.462,"Well, uh, play it for me sometime I don't have to get out of here."
00:39:00.130,00:39:01.214,Deal?
00:39:01.256,00:39:03.133,"Yeah, deal."
00:39:03.175,00:39:05.468,"Now, you know what you want yet?"
00:39:05.510,00:39:07.470,To get out of here.
00:39:10.431,00:39:30.243,MAN: dug-a-re-dug-a-da dug-a-re-dug-a-da dug-a-re-dug-a-da always look like a zeb-ora You're right. I do like it.
00:39:30.285,00:39:31.911,Good.
00:39:31.953,00:39:34.747,"So, what's your story, Baby?"
00:39:34.789,00:39:36.291,You from here?
00:39:36.333,00:39:37.834,I am.
00:39:37.876,00:39:40.628,Keep going. Keep going.
00:39:40.670,00:39:42.463,You're from here.
00:39:42.505,00:39:46.176,You're a driver.
00:39:46.634,00:39:47.886,No.
00:39:47.927,00:39:52.932,"I've, uh, spoken more to you today than I have to anyone all year."
00:39:52.974,00:39:54.517,Whoa.
00:39:54.559,00:39:56.353,Okay.
00:39:56.477,00:39:58.897,Not a motor-mouth. Noted.
00:39:58.938,00:40:01.066,"Yeah, yeah. I have..."
00:40:01.107,00:40:04.194,"I have this, uh, hearing thing."
00:40:04.236,00:40:06.445,I was in an accident when I was little.
00:40:06.487,00:40:07.906,Is that what happened to your mom?
00:40:07.947,00:40:09.532,"Yeah. Yeah, and my dad."
00:40:10.992,00:40:11.993,I miss her.
00:40:13.995,00:40:15.121,I'm sorry.
00:40:15.163,00:40:16.789,"No, don't be."
00:40:16.831,00:40:21.253,"I live with my foster dad, but now he's getting old, so it's more like I'm looking after him."
00:40:21.294,00:40:24.422,Yeah. I know how that feels.
00:40:24.505,00:40:27.466,I had to look after my mom when she got sick.
00:40:27.508,00:40:32.513,"It might seem tough now, but once they're gone, you'll miss having someone to care for."
00:40:34.015,00:40:36.642,I don't have much to keep me here anymore.
00:40:37.518,00:40:38.436,You don't?
00:40:42.565,00:40:48.988,"You know, mmm, we could get together some other time, some other place?"
00:40:49.030,00:40:52.992,"Oh, you mean, uh, somewhere that's not a diner or a laundromat?"
00:40:53.034,00:40:55.828,it's not that this isn't nice but...
00:40:55.870,00:40:59.457,"Oh, well, we could go to, uh... Um..."
00:41:00.125,00:41:01.584,"Oh, Bacchanalia."
00:41:01.626,00:41:03.836,I've never been.
00:41:03.878,00:41:06.089,"Oh, it's..."
00:41:03.878,00:41:08.341,It's the finest winin' and dinin' of all the wines and dines in town.
00:41:11.136,00:41:13.221,"Um, but they got me pulling doubles this week, though."
00:41:13.263,00:41:15.348,What about next week?
00:41:15.390,00:41:16.599,I don't know.
00:41:16.641,00:41:19.311,"Oh, I forgot."
00:41:19.352,00:41:21.271,"No, I mean, I'm..."
00:41:21.313,00:41:22.521,You're not driving anymore?
00:41:22.563,00:41:23.982,No.
00:41:24.023,00:41:25.524,I'm sorry.
00:41:25.566,00:41:27.526,"No, don't be."
00:41:27.568,00:41:29.988,"Well, aren't you the lucky one."
00:41:30.029,00:41:55.596,"MAN: His name, Malik Kelly, a local veteran."
00:41:55.638,00:41:59.517,You saw what these folks were doing.
00:42:01.727,00:42:05.231,"MALIK: I saw these guys go marching in the bank with Halloween masks, weapons drawn."
00:42:05.273,00:42:06.483,They were attacking...
00:42:06.649,00:42:07.608,Is this the place?
00:42:11.821,00:42:13.281,Here.
00:42:34.302,00:42:36.137,Pizza?
00:42:40.975,00:42:42.394,MAN: Order's up!
00:43:00.412,00:43:02.288,Whoa.
00:43:03.456,00:43:04.749,That was fast.
00:43:04.790,00:43:06.042,I know.
00:43:06.084,00:43:08.169,FRAT BOY: Pizza!
00:43:49.294,00:44:24.370,MAN: my arms and hold you You're all good.
00:44:24.412,00:44:25.455,A gentleman?
00:44:27.039,00:44:28.791,Who is that?
00:44:29.959,00:44:31.628,BABY: It's my old boss.
00:44:32.920,00:44:34.547,Uh...
00:44:34.589,00:44:36.299,Excuse me one second.
00:44:38.217,00:44:39.969,"VALET: Here you are, madam."
00:44:40.928,00:44:42.180,VALET: Have a good night.
00:44:44.932,00:44:46.309,"Good meal, Baby?"
00:44:46.351,00:44:48.561,"That foie gras terrine is something, huh?"
00:44:49.103,00:44:50.396,Yeah.
00:44:50.438,00:44:52.315,You don't look happy to see me. Why?
00:44:52.357,00:44:54.984,"I said we were straight, but did you think we were done?"
00:44:55.026,00:44:56.693,That that was it?
00:44:56.777,00:44:58.863,"Uh, I guess I did."
00:44:58.904,00:45:03.409,"Well, I could give you the good news and the bad news, except there is no bad news."
00:45:03.451,00:45:05.911,The good news is you're about to make a lot of money.
00:45:05.953,00:45:09.415,And the good news is you're about to make a lot of money.
00:45:09.457,00:45:11.125,"I got... I got a job, Doc."
00:45:11.167,00:45:19.509,"Yeah, but why slave away delivering GoodFellas pizzas just to afford a night out here, when you could make all that dough with a great fella? Me."
00:45:19.551,00:45:23.095,And then take your gal here for fucking dinner every night of the week?
00:45:23.137,00:45:25.806,You paid off your debt.
00:45:25.848,00:45:27.600,"This is the fun bit, Baby."
00:45:27.642,00:45:34.524,"By the time this job is over, you'll be rolling in money, buying Maseratis and feeding your gal catfish dipped in gold."
00:45:34.566,00:45:35.774,"So, what do you say?"
00:45:37.276,00:45:38.861,Am I in?
00:45:38.903,00:45:40.863,"No, don't answer my question with another question."
00:45:40.905,00:45:43.324,You give me one of two replies. Yes or no.
00:45:45.159,00:45:48.037,"No, Doc."
00:45:48.079,00:45:51.666,"You know I never do a job with the exact same crew twice, right?"
00:45:51.708,00:45:53.167,Yes.
00:45:51.708,00:45:55.587,And you also know you've been my driver for every job since we met.
00:45:56.504,00:45:57.838,Yes.
00:45:59.424,00:46:07.014,"So, I'm of the thinking that you are my lucky charm and that I'm not doing this job without you."
00:46:07.056,00:46:13.521,"Now, I don't think I need to give you the speech about what happens when you say no, how I could break your legs and kill everyone you love, because you already know that, don't you?"
00:46:15.106,00:46:16.815,Yeah.
00:46:16.899,00:46:20.361,"So, what's it gonna be, behind the wheel or in a wheelchair?"
00:46:21.237,00:46:22.363,The first one.
00:46:24.865,00:46:26.033,I'll pick you up in the morning.
00:46:27.201,00:46:29.078,"Don't stay out too late, now."
00:46:29.120,00:46:30.455,Oh.
00:46:30.496,00:46:34.166,"And your, uh, waitress girlfriend, she's cute."
00:46:34.208,00:46:36.335,Let's keep it that way.
00:46:36.377,00:46:38.212,"VALET: Good night, sir."
00:46:42.049,00:46:45.844,"DEBORA: Well, that was some pretty fine winin' and dinin'."
00:46:45.886,00:46:49.140,Must have friends in high places to get a table there.
00:46:49.181,00:46:50.933,"BABY: Oh, I don't know about that."
00:46:53.394,00:46:55.396,"Is everything okay, Baby?"
00:46:58.941,00:47:00.568,It will be.
00:47:00.610,00:47:04.530,You want to talk about it?
00:47:04.572,00:47:07.908,"I mean, I... I don't."
00:47:08.660,00:47:10.953,"I want to, but I..."
00:47:10.995,00:47:12.580,I can't right now.
00:47:12.622,00:47:15.082,"You know, you..."
00:47:15.124,00:47:18.043,You don't have to worry about me.
00:47:18.085,00:47:19.629,You can tell me anything.
00:47:19.671,00:47:21.046,I'm not worried about you.
00:47:21.088,00:47:23.840,"I mean, I..."
00:47:23.924,00:47:27.928,You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
00:47:27.970,00:47:33.309,And I just worry that I'm not good enough for you.
00:47:34.268,00:47:37.104,"Oh, well, don't."
00:47:39.649,00:47:43.736,I can see you're kind and you're different.
00:47:45.571,00:47:48.032,And I'm here for you when you're ready.
00:48:00.419,00:48:01.713,What are you doing tomorrow?
00:48:04.382,00:48:05.842,"Uh, you tell me."
00:48:28.865,00:48:30.491,Good morning.
00:48:32.993,00:48:35.204,These places never get rolled.
00:48:35.246,00:48:37.998,People don't realize that there's gold in them there hills.
00:48:38.040,00:48:42.294,"And those that do, don't have the stones to pull off a job so public in the hub of it."
00:48:42.336,00:48:46.298,"This place'll be ripe around this time tomorrow, but I need you to do something for me today."
00:48:46.340,00:48:48.426,"I can't be seen in there, but you can."
00:48:48.467,00:48:50.052,So go inside.
00:48:50.094,00:48:56.684,"Take note of the number of cameras and positions, the number of registers open, the number of employees and the number of customers."
00:48:56.726,00:48:58.477,Is there a guard?
00:48:58.519,00:49:00.479,Do they have bandit glass?
00:49:00.521,00:49:02.690,"And get in line, buy some stamps."
00:49:02.732,00:49:06.151,"Take your buds out, pull your shades off."
00:49:06.193,00:49:09.488,"Oh, and, uh, take the nephew."
00:49:13.743,00:49:15.327,The United States Postal Service.
00:49:15.369,00:49:18.706,"We're here, working for you, seven days a week."
00:49:18.748,00:49:21.500,We do a lot more than just stamps these days.
00:49:21.542,00:49:24.961,You'd be surprised at what we have to offer.
00:49:25.045,00:49:27.131,"Yeah, Jack, all looks fine back here. Over."
00:49:42.563,00:49:52.197,"one armed guard, 10 cameras, eight registers, two open, 11 customers and four employees."
00:49:52.239,00:49:53.616,Thank you.
00:49:57.077,00:49:58.496,Uh...
00:49:58.537,00:49:59.956,"Uh, stamps."
00:50:01.749,00:50:03.167,That your boy?
00:50:03.793,00:50:05.377,Sure.
00:50:05.419,00:50:06.671,"Yeah, he sure is."
00:50:06.712,00:50:07.713,How old is he?
00:50:09.423,00:50:11.676,Four.
00:50:11.717,00:50:14.094,"They grow up so freaking fast, don't they?"
00:50:16.388,00:50:17.556,Does he have a name?
00:50:18.933,00:50:20.434,"You have a name, don't you?"
00:50:20.476,00:50:21.978,Samm.
00:50:22.102,00:50:24.647,"Well, Samm, I got a mint with your name on it."
00:50:24.689,00:50:27.316,You have a mint that says Samm?
00:50:27.358,00:50:28.734,Aw.
00:50:30.695,00:50:32.237,Are you here tomorrow?
00:50:32.279,00:50:34.573,"Sure am. Working 9:00 to 5:00, just like Dolly."
00:50:35.616,00:50:38.536,"Oh, Dolly Parton. Yeah."
00:50:38.577,00:50:40.663,I like her.
00:50:40.705,00:50:42.748,"Everybody wants happiness, nobody wants pain."
00:50:42.790,00:50:45.584,But you can't have a rainbow without a little rain.
00:50:48.128,00:50:50.422,"Yeah, she sure is."
00:50:50.464,00:50:51.465,Bye.
00:51:01.017,00:51:02.018,Hit me.
00:51:03.143,00:51:09.525,"No bandit glass, one armed guard, 10 cameras, eight registers, three open."
00:51:10.651,00:51:13.320,"And, uh, 11 customers."
00:51:17.241,00:51:18.910,"And, uh, four employees."
00:51:18.951,00:51:20.160,Anything else?
00:51:21.203,00:51:22.788,The teller seemed nice.
00:51:22.830,00:51:24.206,She gave me a mint.
00:51:24.248,00:51:26.042,Did she?
00:51:26.166,00:51:28.586,You probably wouldn't even need to use a gun with her.
00:51:28.627,00:51:31.756,"Just say boo, and she'll give you the big bills first."
00:51:33.173,00:51:34.675,Chip's off the old block.
00:51:43.684,00:51:45.185,What floor are you on?
00:51:46.353,00:51:48.146,Third.
00:51:48.188,00:51:50.566,"DOC: Those stairs must be a real bitch for Joe, huh?"
00:51:52.068,00:51:54.194,It's my business to know everything.
00:51:54.236,00:51:56.321,"So, are they a bitch?"
00:51:56.363,00:51:57.823,There's an elevator.
00:51:59.241,00:52:01.827,"Ooh, fancy."
00:52:04.371,00:52:05.414,"So, am I gonna see you tonight?"
00:52:06.958,00:52:08.876,"Yes, you will."
00:52:08.918,00:52:10.669,"You're not just saying what you think I want to hear, right?"
00:52:10.711,00:52:13.213,"You consider me a friend, don't you?"
00:52:14.506,00:52:16.008,You and I are a team.
00:52:16.050,00:52:18.302,Nothing is more important than our friendship.
00:52:19.095,00:52:20.596,Good to know.
00:52:20.638,00:52:23.724,You'll be out of this shithole soon.
00:52:23.766,00:52:25.810,You're going up in the world!
00:52:35.694,00:52:37.321,"Bo's Diner, what'll you have?"

00:56:47.487,00:56:51.742,"Now, he bought it a little later, but it had nothing to do with the heist."

00:58:20.998,00:58:22.291,"Did you get all that, Baby?"
00:58:22.333,00:58:23.625,Yeah.

00:59:42.913,00:59:44.789,Which guy?
00:59:44.831,00:59:48.460,"The guy that robbed you, the guy that called you a whore, or the guy that looked at you funny?"

00:59:52.423,00:59:54.966,Bats just looked at me funny.
00:59:57.677,01:00:00.138,BUDDY: You want me to kill Bats?
01:00:00.180,01:00:02.474,"Not before the job, silly."
01:00:04.560,01:00:06.562,You think we should talk about this in front of Baby?
01:00:08.063,01:00:10.065,He won't say a thing.
01:00:13.569,01:00:15.153,Jesus Christ.
01:00:15.195,01:00:16.488,"What, did you steal all this?"

01:01:37.277,01:01:38.820,Why would he need it?
01:01:38.862,01:01:42.740,"Got to swagger in like you got one, so we don't all look like a bunch of pussies."
01:01:42.782,01:01:44.784,Darling excluded.
01:01:44.826,01:01:49.623,BY THE BUTTON What's with the earbuds?

01:02:10.477,01:02:12.062,"We met before, right?"
01:02:12.103,01:02:13.938,I don't know.
01:02:13.980,01:02:15.023,Uh-huh.
01:02:15.065,01:02:16.816,Then I guess we ain't never met.

01:02:57.190,01:03:02.613,"From the shoulder of the hog comes the Boston butt, a tough but tasty cut."
01:03:02.654,01:03:07.784,The picnic shoulder is a favorite of those who enjoy the smoking of pigs.
01:03:07.867,01:03:14.583,"The center-cut loin, the double-cut pork chops, baby back ribs, and the Serrano ham, on the back leg, of course."
01:03:14.625,01:03:16.084,All delicious.
01:03:16.126,01:03:17.919,Delicious.
01:03:17.961,01:03:21.172,"And, of course, we have a fine selection of sausages."

01:04:17.312,01:04:18.814,Weren't they fucking Doc's contacts?
01:04:18.938,01:04:20.273,They were Doc's contacts!
01:04:20.315,01:04:21.608,"Guess what, they was pigs."
01:04:21.650,01:04:23.234,Look at the box.
01:04:23.276,01:04:27.656,I clocked that tall strip of bacon with that fake-ass Louis Vuitton hat right off the bat.
01:04:27.698,01:04:29.741,He busted me in '98.
01:04:29.783,01:04:35.079,"Now, I don't know about you lovebirds fucking without a condom, but when somebody getting ready to barbecue me, I go full-metal batshit on..."
01:04:35.121,01:04:36.665,DARLING: Shit!

01:05:26.840,01:05:29.426,"BATS: When your folks name you Bats, you gonna end up crazy."
01:05:29.467,01:05:33.054,"I don't doubt you're crazy, but your real name is not Bats."
01:05:33.096,01:05:34.431,So says you.
01:05:34.472,01:05:36.307,You think my real name's Darling?

01:05:39.227,01:05:40.604,"Code names, monikers."
01:05:42.021,01:05:44.357,"So, what's your real name, Darling?"
01:05:44.399,01:05:46.443,Monica.
01:05:46.484,01:05:48.820,"Hey, I thought we weren't allowed to discuss names."
01:05:48.862,01:05:50.655,We're not.
01:05:50.697,01:05:52.198,"Baby, what's your real name?"
01:05:53.867,01:05:55.034,Huh?
01:05:56.536,01:05:58.538,"Hey, stop, stop, stop up here."
01:05:58.580,01:06:00.039,Stop up here.
01:06:01.416,01:06:03.000,I said stop. I'm hungry.
01:06:04.043,01:06:05.253,No.
01:06:05.295,01:06:07.046,Stop the car!
01:06:10.049,01:06:11.509,No?
01:06:11.551,01:06:13.010,You're telling me no?
01:06:14.053,01:06:15.597,I don't want to go in there.
01:06:15.639,01:06:16.932,I don't want to go in there.
01:06:18.057,01:06:19.976,"Well, hello, Baby."
01:06:20.059,01:06:22.103,"Bodies hit the floor back there, you don't say shit."
01:06:22.145,01:06:23.647,"Now all of a sudden, you getting..."
01:06:23.688,01:06:25.106,You getting riled up about stopping at a diner?
01:06:26.566,01:06:28.568,I don't want to go in there.
01:06:28.610,01:06:32.071,"Well, with that recommendation, we gots to go in now."
01:06:38.536,01:07:04.896,"WITH MY BABY BY MAN: BATS: Now, why y'all so mad?"
01:07:04.938,01:07:06.773,For being a walking fucking death wish?
01:07:06.815,01:07:09.150,"Well, I treat all of my jobs like it's my last."
01:07:09.192,01:07:11.695,"Yeah, but what you do within this group affects all of us."
01:07:11.736,01:07:14.322,"Fine, cowboy. You're gonna get your money tomorrow."
01:07:15.782,01:07:17.826,I know you guys got noses to feed.
01:07:17.868,01:07:19.160,"What, yeah, like you're Mr. Clean."
01:07:19.202,01:07:21.245,I'm Mr. Whatever the Fuck I Wanna Be.
01:07:22.622,01:07:24.374,Can I get you anything to drink?
01:07:24.415,01:07:26.083,"BATS: Uh, yeah, I think it'll be, uh, Coke all around, right?"
01:07:26.125,01:07:28.294,How... How you say it in your language? Coca?
01:07:28.336,01:07:31.047,So let me get three Cokes and one Coca.
01:07:31.130,01:07:32.590,Four Cokes?
01:07:35.635,01:07:37.387,"Look, here's the deal."
01:07:37.428,01:07:39.389,You rob to support a drug habit.
01:07:39.430,01:07:41.349,I do drugs to support a robbery habit.
01:07:41.391,01:07:43.434,That's clever.
01:07:43.476,01:07:45.269,It's you two who's on vacation.
01:07:45.311,01:07:47.522,So you doubt our credentials?
01:07:47.564,01:07:49.065,"Wall Street, right?"
01:07:49.148,01:07:50.608,Doc ain't tell me shit.
01:07:52.610,01:07:56.406,Just a educated guess from an uneducated man.
01:07:56.447,01:07:58.783,"Well, Bats, I would be fascinated to hear your thoughts on the matter."
01:07:58.825,01:08:00.535,"Tell me if I'm way off, Buddy."
01:08:00.577,01:08:03.955,You were a stockbroker.
01:08:05.456,01:08:09.335,"You stack your paper, but you say shit like, Work hard, play harder, but you play a little too hard."
01:08:09.377,01:08:13.631,"You rack up debt, the type of debt that'd make a white man blush."
01:08:13.673,01:08:15.383,Maybe you get into a little trouble.
01:08:15.425,01:08:17.052,Maybe you get your hand caught in the corporate cookie jar.
01:08:17.176,01:08:18.595,Maybe you leave and run off to the desert.
01:08:18.636,01:08:20.430,Maybe with your favorite lap dancer in tow.
01:08:20.471,01:08:26.061,"Maybe you disappear into a world consisting of three things, money, sex, drugs and action."
01:08:28.271,01:08:29.731,"Oh, shit, that's four."
01:08:31.399,01:08:32.525,Am I close?
01:08:34.027,01:08:35.319,This how I look at it.
01:08:35.361,01:08:37.822,You guys just think this is a trip.
01:08:37.864,01:08:42.368,"Either way, if you are Wall Street, you're a bigger fucking crook than I could ever be."
01:08:46.497,01:08:49.500,I'm gonna go right ahead and speak for the two of us.
01:08:54.464,01:08:57.050,You think you know us?
01:08:57.092,01:08:58.676,Mmm.
01:08:58.718,01:09:00.804,DARLING: You think you're the last word in crazy?
01:09:02.346,01:09:04.307,You're not.
01:09:04.348,01:09:09.687,"And believe me when I tell you, you don't want to see my Buddy mad."
01:09:09.729,01:09:13.190,You haven't seen how relentless he is.
01:09:13.232,01:09:19.114,"Because when he sees red, see nothing but black."
01:09:24.702,01:09:26.203,"You hear that, Speedy?"
01:09:26.245,01:09:28.498,That was nice.
01:09:28.539,01:09:30.249,"You see this shit, Baby?"
01:09:30.291,01:09:34.337,"See, now this is a prime example of a man who loves a woman."
01:09:35.630,01:09:36.756,You guys are perfect for each other.
01:09:37.924,01:09:39.342,I mean that.
01:09:43.262,01:09:45.264,"DEBORA: Well, what can I get you to eat?"
01:09:46.850,01:09:54.190,"Get these cats some Happy Meals, and, uh, I'm gonna take care of the bill, uh, Debora."
01:09:54.273,01:09:59.737,"Yo, my friend here, he, uh... He doesn't like this place, but I think this place kind of nice, you know?"
01:09:59.779,01:10:02.115,"So let me ask you something, Debora."
01:10:04.534,01:10:07.912,WOMAN: What's his problem?
01:10:10.123,01:10:13.877,"Uh, maybe your friend would like to fill out a suggestion slip."
01:10:13.918,01:10:15.586,Tell us how to improve our service.
01:10:24.679,01:10:25.847,"Baby, you know that bitch?"
01:10:27.515,01:10:29.100,No.
01:10:29.142,01:10:31.144,BATS: Okay.
01:10:31.186,01:10:32.187,Let's bounce.
01:10:32.812,01:10:34.064,I got this.
01:10:35.356,01:10:36.941,What the fuck is your problem?
01:10:36.983,01:10:38.275,Hmm?
01:10:45.825,01:10:48.285,Okay.
01:10:48.327,01:10:50.496,"Well, make sure you tip the nice lady."
01:11:08.514,01:11:44.425,all the things Bananas.
01:11:45.551,01:11:47.720,Bananas is a code word.
01:11:47.762,01:11:53.601,"Whenever a deal is done with one of my clients, they call me on the phone and they say the word bananas, and then they hang up."
01:11:55.436,01:11:59.857,I did not hear the word bananas tonight.
01:11:59.899,01:12:02.359,So you tell me who died.
01:12:02.401,01:12:04.028,"Well, your contacts was cops, Doc."
01:12:04.070,01:12:06.864,I know. They were my cops.
01:12:06.906,01:12:09.492,"Yeah, well, they fired first."
01:12:09.533,01:12:12.328,And I'm not gonna take a bullet for you or nobody else in this motherfucker.
01:12:12.411,01:12:14.664,Is that true?
01:12:16.707,01:12:17.750,Yeah.
01:12:28.552,01:12:29.846,Baby?
01:12:29.887,01:12:31.681,Ask somebody on the planet Earth.
01:12:31.722,01:12:33.933,I will ask whoever the fuck I want.
01:12:35.601,01:12:37.353,"Go home, job's off."
01:12:37.436,01:12:39.147,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute."
01:12:39.189,01:12:42.399,We are 24 hours from being descended upon by this entire city.
01:12:42.441,01:12:44.485,Those pigs are in hog heaven.
01:12:44.527,01:12:46.154,The only way they can ID us is with a Ouija board or some shit.
01:12:46.196,01:12:49.073,"Well, your name only takes four letters to spell out."
01:12:49.115,01:12:51.159,"Doc, Bats ain't my real fucking name."
01:12:52.952,01:12:54.912,"It's over, Leon."
01:12:56.206,01:12:57.874,Get out of town.
01:12:58.708,01:13:00.626,Wow.
01:13:00.668,01:13:02.920,"Well, I ain't running, Doc."
01:13:02.962,01:13:06.590,I say we drive into the storm.
01:13:06.632,01:13:13.139,"We could be on a non-extradition beach, drinking non-extradition cocktails, counting our non-extradition cash in 23 hours."
01:13:13.181,01:13:16.976,DOC: And who do we get to fence those money orders since you shot the fence?
01:13:17.018,01:13:19.020,BATS: Buddy got a guy.
01:13:19.062,01:13:21.105,"I mean, I'm just taking a wild guess here, but Buddy got a guy."
01:13:21.147,01:13:23.107,"Ain't that right, Wall Street?"
01:13:24.483,01:13:26.443,"Yeah, I got a guy."
01:13:26.485,01:13:28.071,So let's fucking do this.
01:13:29.030,01:13:33.284,"I only hear three voices, and the last time I checked, there's four in a car."
01:13:33.326,01:13:35.286,Baby? Your call.
01:13:35.328,01:13:36.704,Time to make a big-boy decision.
01:13:36.746,01:13:38.622,Do we do this thing or not?
01:13:38.664,01:13:40.416,He's outvoted.
01:13:40.499,01:13:42.085,Let him speak.
01:13:43.502,01:13:45.462,I say we all get some sleep.
01:13:45.504,01:13:47.173,Get ready for this fucking thing.
01:14:06.567,01:14:08.403,DOC: Baby? Your call.
01:14:08.527,01:14:10.154,Time to make a big-boy decision.
01:14:10.196,01:14:12.282,Do we do this thing or not?
01:14:12.323,01:14:14.158,Do we do this thing or not?
01:14:14.200,01:14:15.993,Do we do this thing or not?
01:14:16.035,01:14:19.038,Do we do this thing or not?
01:15:24.020,01:15:25.604,"Where you going, Baby?"
01:15:27.315,01:15:28.691,"Uh, coffee."
01:15:29.775,01:15:31.861,At 2:00 a.m.?
01:15:31.902,01:15:34.613,That doesn't sound smart.
01:15:34.655,01:15:36.699,You fucking kidding me?
01:15:34.655,01:15:39.452,"I got enough on my plate, worrying about Bats, I got to worry about you, too, now?"
01:15:40.703,01:15:42.372,You know what?
01:15:42.413,01:15:49.628,"If you're gonna mail it in at the post office tomorrow, then go on your little caffeine run and don't come back."
01:15:51.839,01:15:57.303,"If you're just in this for the buzz, if driving is just some kind of escape for you, then go."
01:15:57.345,01:16:01.682,What y'all doing in here?
01:16:01.724,01:16:03.559,Just making sure everything's ready for tomorrow.
01:16:03.642,01:16:05.644,"Oh, yeah."
01:16:05.686,01:16:08.439,"Well, uh, look like he's going somewhere at 2:00 in the morning."
01:16:10.191,01:16:12.193,Are you?
01:16:13.110,01:16:15.654,Good. That's good.
01:16:18.241,01:16:20.117,'Cause we got to discuss this.
01:16:21.411,01:16:22.703,"No, no, it's the same one."
01:16:24.997,01:16:26.457,Baby? Your call.
01:16:26.499,01:16:28.459,Time to make a big-boy decision.
01:16:28.501,01:16:29.960,Do we do this thing or not?
01:16:30.002,01:16:33.130,"BATS: Now, why you want to go and do that?"
01:16:33.172,01:16:35.174,It's just me fooling around.
01:16:36.675,01:16:39.095,Why you like to record stuff?
01:16:39.136,01:16:41.597,You the police?
01:16:41.680,01:16:43.015,"Supposed to squeal on the road, not to the cops."
01:16:43.057,01:16:44.934,"Speak up, Baby."
01:16:44.975,01:16:47.144,I... I like to listen back to conversations.
01:16:47.186,01:16:52.316,"I make music out of the words, songs, mixes."
01:16:52.358,01:16:54.985,fucking dumbass excuse.
01:16:55.027,01:16:58.655,"To be fair, even the cops couldn't come up with an excuse that fucking dumbass."
01:16:58.697,01:17:00.491,Now can you play us one of your mixes?
01:17:00.533,01:17:02.826,"I can't, they're..."
01:17:02.868,01:17:05.913,"Well, it looks like we're all going somewhere at 2:00 in the morning, then."
01:17:05.955,01:17:07.498,Come on.
01:17:07.540,01:17:08.999,I live really far away.
01:17:10.501,01:17:11.835,"No, you don't."
01:17:14.713,01:17:16.632,"Wake up, Baby."
01:17:16.715,01:17:17.883,Time to explain.
01:17:25.475,01:17:26.601,Joe.
01:17:26.725,01:17:27.935,Where is he?
01:17:27.977,01:17:29.019,"BATS: Oh, the cripple?"
01:17:30.146,01:17:32.440,"Oh, don't worry about him."
01:17:32.482,01:17:35.526,He's good.
01:17:35.568,01:17:37.528,"Why don't you play us something, Baby?"
01:17:50.833,01:18:00.384,DOC: GRIFF: DOC: behind the wheel Was he slow?
01:18:00.426,01:18:08.142,"GRIFF: DOC: shit is bananas, Doc."

01:18:21.614,01:18:24.492,It's Debbie. Debora.
01:18:24.534,01:18:27.286,"Yeah, except I'm D-E-B-O-R-A."
01:18:27.328,01:18:29.955,Debora.
01:18:31.790,01:18:33.917,You said you didn't know that bitch.
01:18:33.959,01:18:36.086,BUDDY: Why would you say you didn't know her?
01:18:36.128,01:18:38.297,Have you been talking to Debora about us?
01:18:38.339,01:18:39.507,I don't say nothing.
01:18:39.549,01:18:40.633,What about Wheels?
01:18:40.675,01:18:42.593,He can't say nothing.
01:18:42.635,01:18:44.720,"Yeah, but he can read motherfucking lips, though, can't he?"
01:18:44.803,01:18:46.763,DOC: Take this fool back to his shithole.
01:18:46.805,01:18:48.765,I'll find another driver for tomorrow.
01:18:48.807,01:18:50.934,"Doc, I'm available."
01:18:48.807,01:18:52.269,"I can take him where he needs to go, get him home safe."
01:18:52.311,01:18:54.271,"No, you're not getting a new driver."
01:18:54.313,01:18:56.691,I've been on every job since we met.
01:18:56.815,01:18:59.026,"I don't squeal to the cops, I squeal on the road."
01:18:59.068,01:19:00.611,"And I'm not slow, I'm fast."
01:19:02.863,01:19:05.282,I'm your driver tomorrow.
