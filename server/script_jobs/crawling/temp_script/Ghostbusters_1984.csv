00:02:42.788,00:02:44.957,VENKMAN: All right.
00:02:44.957,00:02:47.250,I'm gonna turn over the next card.
00:02:47.250,00:02:49.670,I want you to concentrate.
00:02:49.670,00:02:53.048,I want you to tell me what you think it is.
00:02:57.886,00:02:59.805,Square.
00:02:59.805,00:03:02.223,"Good guess, but wrong."
00:03:11.232,00:03:12.693,Clear your head.
00:03:15.320,00:03:18.032,All right.
00:03:20.199,00:03:21.869,Is it a star?
00:03:21.869,00:03:23.578,It is a star.
00:03:23.578,00:03:25.664,Very good.
00:03:25.664,00:03:27.541,Okay.
00:03:27.541,00:03:30.002,All right.
00:03:30.002,00:03:31.795,Think hard.
00:03:31.795,00:03:33.463,What is it?
00:03:33.463,00:03:35.049,Circle.
00:03:35.049,00:03:36.884,Close.
00:03:36.884,00:03:38.760,But definitely wrong.
00:03:42.890,00:03:44.641,Okay.
00:03:44.641,00:03:47.144,All right. Ready?
00:03:47.144,00:03:48.687,Yeah.
00:03:48.687,00:03:50.105,All right.
00:03:50.105,00:03:52.482,What is it?
00:03:54.651,00:03:56.820,Come on.
00:03:56.820,00:03:58.906,Figure eight.
00:04:01.200,00:04:02.910,Incredible.
00:04:02.910,00:04:05.162,That's five for five.
00:04:05.162,00:04:07.414,"No, no."
00:04:07.414,00:04:09.917,"No, I swear. They're just coming to me."
00:04:11.376,00:04:12.627,Okay.
00:04:12.627,00:04:14.838,Nervous?
00:04:14.838,00:04:16.464,Yes.
00:04:16.464,00:04:18.800,I don't like this.
00:04:18.800,00:04:20.677,You only have 75 more to go.
00:04:20.677,00:04:22.971,Okay. What's this one?
00:04:26.808,00:04:29.103,It's a couple of wavy lines.
00:04:29.103,00:04:31.479,Sorry.
00:04:31.479,00:04:33.190,I know...
00:04:33.190,00:04:35.525,Um...
00:04:35.525,00:04:43.491,"Wait. Uh...Um-- Wait, I-- I, oh-- I'm getting a little tired of this!"
00:04:43.491,00:04:45.827,"You volunteered, didn't you?"
00:04:45.827,00:04:48.580,"Yeah, but I didn't know you were gonna be giving me electric shocks."
00:04:48.580,00:04:51.125,"What are you trying to prove here, anyway?"
00:04:51.125,00:04:56.421,I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on E.S.P. ability.
00:04:56.421,00:04:57.756,I'll tell you what the effect is.
00:04:57.756,00:04:59.174,It's pissing me off!
00:04:59.174,00:05:00.926,"Well, then, maybe my theory is correct!"
00:05:00.926,00:05:02.385,You can keep the 5 bucks.
00:05:02.385,00:05:03.929,I've had it.
00:05:08.892,00:05:10.811,You may as well get used to that.
00:05:10.811,00:05:16.691,It's the kind of resentment that your ability is going to provoke in some people.
00:05:16.691,00:05:19.444,"Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman?"
00:05:20.904,00:05:22.948,"You're no fluke, Jennifer."
00:05:23.907,00:05:25.200,This is it.
00:05:25.200,00:05:26.701,This is definitely it.
00:05:26.701,00:05:29.204,Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera?
00:05:29.204,00:05:31.706,"And that blank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday."
00:05:31.706,00:05:34.501,Will you excuse me for a second?
00:05:34.501,00:05:35.836,Sure.
00:05:37.171,00:05:39.881,"I'm right in the middle of something, Ray."
00:05:39.881,00:05:43.218,I need a little more time with this subject.
00:05:43.218,00:05:45.304,"Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half?"
00:05:45.304,00:05:55.772,"Peter, at 1:40 p.m., at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, 10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition."
00:05:55.772,00:06:00.777,It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.
00:06:00.777,00:06:02.737,I'm very excited.
00:06:02.737,00:06:04.531,I want you to get right down there.
00:06:04.531,00:06:06.533,"Check it out, and get back to me."
00:06:06.533,00:06:07.742,"No, no."
00:06:07.742,00:06:09.119,"No, Peter, you're coming with us."
00:06:09.119,00:06:10.369,Spengler went down there.
00:06:10.369,00:06:13.372,"He took PKE valences, went right off the top of the scale."
00:06:13.372,00:06:14.958,Buried the needle.
00:06:14.958,00:06:16.251,We're close on this one.
00:06:16.251,00:06:17.585,I can feel it.
00:06:20.297,00:06:22.049,I can feel it.
00:06:22.049,00:06:24.551,"We're very, very close."
00:06:26.511,00:06:30.307,"I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd like to work with you some more."
00:06:30.307,00:06:32.226,"Perhaps you could come back this evening, say at..."
00:06:32.226,00:06:33.560,Eight o'clock?
00:06:33.560,00:06:36.855,"I was just going to say, 8:00?"
00:06:36.855,00:06:38.773,You are a legitimate phenomenon.
00:06:41.776,00:06:45.864,"As a friend, I have to tell you you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business."
00:06:45.864,00:06:51.410,"You guys have been running your ass off, meeting and greeting every schizo in the five boroughs who says he's had a paranormal experience."
00:06:51.410,00:06:52.579,What have you seen?
00:06:52.579,00:06:57.416,"Of course you forget, Peter, I was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration."
00:06:57.416,00:06:59.794,"Oh, Ray..."
00:06:59.794,00:07:03.257,the sponges migrated about a foot and a half.
00:07:05.092,00:07:07.219,Egon...
00:07:08.511,00:07:09.888,"EGON: Oh, you're here."
00:07:09.888,00:07:11.181,"Yeah, what have you got?"
00:07:11.181,00:07:12.682,"This is big, Peter."
00:07:12.682,00:07:14.434,There's definitely something here.
00:07:14.434,00:07:18.939,"Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head, remember that?"
00:07:18.939,00:07:20.732,That would've worked if you hadn't stopped me.
00:07:20.732,00:07:22.109,Hello.
00:07:22.109,00:07:23.735,Are you the men from the university?
00:07:23.735,00:07:26.238,Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman.
00:07:26.238,00:07:27.530,Egon.
00:07:27.530,00:07:29.032,Thank you for coming.
00:07:29.032,00:07:31.243,I hope we can clear this up quickly and quietly.
00:07:31.243,00:07:32.702,Let's not rush things.
00:07:32.702,00:07:35.872,We don't even know what you have yet.
00:07:35.872,00:07:41.878,"LIBRARIAN: I don't remember seeing any legs, but it definitely had arms, because it reached out for me."
00:07:41.878,00:07:44.256,Arms? I can't wait to get a look at this thing.
00:07:44.256,00:07:47.259,"Alice, I'm gonna ask you a couple of standard questions, okay?"
00:07:47.259,00:07:53.432,"Have you or any member of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?"
00:07:53.432,00:07:56.893,My uncle thought he was Saint Jerome.
00:07:58.519,00:08:00.772,I'd call that a big yes.
00:08:00.772,00:08:02.690,Uh...
00:08:02.690,00:08:05.860,"Are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol?"
00:08:05.860,00:08:07.446,No.
00:08:07.446,00:08:09.239,"No, no. Just asking."
00:08:09.239,00:08:12.659,"Are you, Alice, menstruating right now?"
00:08:12.659,00:08:15.245,What has that got to do with it?
00:08:15.245,00:08:17.331,"Back off, man."
00:08:17.331,00:08:18.748,I'm a scientist.
00:08:18.748,00:08:21.251,Ray! It's moving.
00:08:47.068,00:08:48.862,Look!
00:08:53.825,00:08:56.244,"This is hot, Ray."
00:08:56.244,00:08:57.829,Symmetrical book stacking.
00:08:57.829,00:09:01.375,Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947.
00:09:01.375,00:09:02.750,You're right.
00:09:02.750,00:09:05.795,No human being would stack books like this.
00:09:05.795,00:09:08.423,Listen!
00:09:08.423,00:09:10.509,Do you smell something?
00:09:18.016,00:09:22.229,Talk about telekinetic activity.
00:09:22.229,00:09:25.106,"Raymond, look at this."
00:09:25.106,00:09:27.775,Ectoplasmic residue!
00:09:27.775,00:09:30.445,"Venkman, get a sample of this."
00:09:30.445,00:09:32.072,It's the real thing.
00:09:32.072,00:09:34.824,"Look, somebody blows their nose, and you want to keep it?"
00:09:34.824,00:09:36.243,I'd like to analyze it.
00:09:36.243,00:09:37.952,RAY: There's more over here.
00:09:37.952,00:09:40.539,EGON: I'm getting stronger readings here.
00:09:40.539,00:09:41.831,VENKMAN: Whoop...
00:09:41.831,00:09:44.418,Oh. Oh!
00:09:44.418,00:09:46.378,Ah...
00:09:46.378,00:09:48.046,This way.
00:09:49.297,00:09:50.924,Come on.
00:09:50.924,00:09:52.842,Oh...
00:09:57.931,00:09:59.849,Gah!
00:10:01.684,00:10:04.354,"Egon, your mucus."
00:10:10.902,00:10:13.363,This happen to you before?
00:10:14.739,00:10:16.950,Huh. First time?
00:10:41.808,00:10:43.393,It's here.
00:10:46.605,00:10:48.856,"A full-torso apparition, and it's real."
00:10:53.945,00:10:55.489,"So, what do we do?"
00:10:59.700,00:11:03.079,"Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please?"
00:11:03.079,00:11:06.374,"Could you just come over here for a second, please?"
00:11:06.374,00:11:07.875,Right over here.
00:11:07.875,00:11:10.044,Come here.
00:11:10.044,00:11:11.546,What do we do?
00:11:11.546,00:11:13.465,I don't know.
00:11:13.465,00:11:14.799,Stop that!
00:11:15.967,00:11:17.594,We've got to make contact.
00:11:17.594,00:11:19.638,One of us should actually try to speak to it.
00:11:19.638,00:11:21.680,Good idea.
00:11:28.813,00:11:30.940,Hello.
00:11:30.940,00:11:32.484,I'm Peter.
00:11:33.901,00:11:36.488,Where are you from?
00:11:36.488,00:11:38.739,Shh...
00:11:41.700,00:11:43.119,All right. Okay.
00:11:43.119,00:11:44.912,The usual stuff isn't working.
00:11:44.912,00:11:47.040,"RAY: Okay, I have a plan."
00:11:47.040,00:11:48.916,I know exactly what to do.
00:11:51.419,00:11:53.712,"Now, stay close."
00:11:53.712,00:11:55.048,Stay close.
00:11:56.007,00:11:57.258,I know.
00:11:57.258,00:11:59.469,Do exactly as I say.
00:11:59.469,00:12:01.054,Get ready.
00:12:01.054,00:12:02.389,Ready? Get her!
00:12:11.356,00:12:13.732,Did you see it?
00:12:13.732,00:12:15.026,We'll get back to you.
00:12:15.026,00:12:17.195,DELACORTE: What?!
00:12:25.161,00:12:26.954,Get her!
00:12:26.954,00:12:28.373,That was your whole plan?
00:12:28.373,00:12:30.500,Get her!
00:12:30.500,00:12:32.669,It was scientific.
00:12:32.669,00:12:34.212,I-- I just got over-excited.
00:12:34.212,00:12:36.673,"I mean, but-- But wasn't it incredible, Pete?"
00:12:36.673,00:12:39.133,"I mean, we actually touched the etheric plane."
00:12:39.133,00:12:40.759,You know what this could mean to the university?
00:12:40.759,00:12:42.095,"VENKMAN: Yeah, gonna be bigger than the microchip."
00:12:42.095,00:12:43.762,"Ray, I'm very excited."
00:12:43.762,00:12:45.640,I wouldn't say the experience was completely wasted.
00:12:45.640,00:12:50.811,"According to these new readings, I think we have an excellent chance of actually catching a ghost and holding it indefinitely."
00:12:50.811,00:12:52.063,"RAY: Well, this is great."
00:12:52.063,00:12:55.942,"If the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities, we could really bust some heads."
00:12:55.942,00:12:58.194,"In a spiritual sense, of course."
00:12:58.194,00:13:00.905,"Spengs, you serious about this catching a ghost?"
00:13:00.905,00:13:03.157,I'm always serious.
00:13:03.157,00:13:06.953,"Egon, I'm gonna take back some of the things I've said about you."
00:13:08.705,00:13:11.291,You've-- You've earned it.
00:13:13.418,00:13:15.920,The possibilities are limitless.
00:13:15.920,00:13:17.255,"Hey, Dean Yeager."
00:13:21.050,00:13:24.512,I trust you're moving us to better quarters on campus?
00:13:24.512,00:13:27.098,"No, you're being moved off campus."
00:13:27.098,00:13:29.643,The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.
00:13:29.643,00:13:31.352,You are to vacate these premises immediately.
00:13:31.352,00:13:35.189,This is preposterous.
00:13:35.189,00:13:36.857,Fine.
00:13:36.857,00:13:42.572,This university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
00:13:42.572,00:13:44.198,But the kids love us.
00:13:44.198,00:13:46.033,Dr. Venkman...
00:13:46.033,00:13:50.163,we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.
00:13:50.163,00:13:54.668,"You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle."
00:13:54.668,00:14:01.174,"Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable."
00:14:01.174,00:14:05.052,"You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman."
00:14:05.052,00:14:07.054,I see.
00:14:07.054,00:14:13.102,And you have no place in this department or in this university.
00:14:13.102,00:14:14.354,This is a major disgrace.
00:14:14.354,00:14:15.938,Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now.
00:14:15.938,00:14:18.650,They wouldn't touch us with a 10-meter cattle prod.
00:14:18.650,00:14:20.234,You're always so concerned about your reputation.
00:14:20.234,00:14:23.196,Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk.
00:14:23.196,00:14:24.864,Do you know how much a patent clerk earns?
00:14:24.864,00:14:26.032,No.
00:14:26.032,00:14:27.325,"Personally, I liked the university."
00:14:27.325,00:14:28.618,They gave us money and facilities.
00:14:28.618,00:14:29.952,We didn't have to produce anything.
00:14:29.952,00:14:31.412,You've never been out of college.
00:14:31.412,00:14:33.206,You don't know what it's like out there.
00:14:33.206,00:14:34.874,I've worked in the private sector.
00:14:34.874,00:14:36.917,They expect results.
00:14:36.917,00:14:44.300,"For whatever reasons, Ray, call it fate, call it luck, call it karma."
00:14:44.300,00:14:47.721,I believe that everything happens for a reason.
00:14:47.721,00:14:51.057,I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
00:14:51.057,00:14:52.475,For what purpose?
00:14:52.475,00:14:55.936,To go into business for ourselves.
00:14:59.899,00:15:04.821,This ecto-containment system that Spengler and I have in mind is gonna require a load of bread to capitalize.
00:15:04.821,00:15:08.408,Where are we gonna get the money?
00:15:08.408,00:15:10.993,I don't know.
00:15:10.993,00:15:12.620,I don't know.
00:15:13.747,00:15:16.457,"You're never gonna regret this, Ray."
00:15:16.457,00:15:19.126,My parents left me that house.
00:15:19.126,00:15:20.795,You're not gonna lose the house.
00:15:20.795,00:15:22.714,Everybody has three mortgages nowadays.
00:15:22.714,00:15:24.173,But at 19 percent?
00:15:24.173,00:15:25.592,You didn't even bargain with the guy!
00:15:25.592,00:15:31.013,"Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone for the first five years comes to $95,000."
00:15:31.013,00:15:32.599,Will you guys relax?
00:15:32.599,00:15:41.608,We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade: professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.
00:15:41.608,00:15:46.112,The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.
00:15:46.112,00:15:50.742,"WOMAN: There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor, and there's a full kitchen on the top left."
00:15:50.742,00:15:55.705,"It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all."
00:15:55.705,00:15:57.874,"What do you think, Egon?"
00:15:57.874,00:16:00.460,I think this building should be condemned.
00:16:00.460,00:16:03.421,There's serious metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members.
00:16:03.421,00:16:04.964,The wiring is sub-standard.
00:16:04.964,00:16:09.844,"It's completely inadequate for our power needs, and the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone."
00:16:09.844,00:16:11.345,RAY: Hey!
00:16:11.345,00:16:12.931,Does this pole still work?
00:16:15.475,00:16:18.728,Wow. This place is great!
00:16:18.728,00:16:20.187,When can we move in?
00:16:20.187,00:16:22.106,You gotta try this pole.
00:16:22.106,00:16:24.150,I'm gonna get my stuff.
00:16:27.987,00:16:30.114,Hey!
00:16:30.114,00:16:31.365,Sleep here.
00:16:31.365,00:16:33.242,"You know, to try it out."
00:16:42.376,00:16:43.962,I think we'll take it.
00:16:43.962,00:16:45.171,Good.
00:17:19.789,00:17:21.123,"Oh, hi."
00:17:26.754,00:17:27.964,"Oh, Dana, it's you."
00:17:27.964,00:17:29.256,"Oh, hi. Yes, Louis, it's me."
00:17:29.256,00:17:30.591,I thought it was the drugstore.
00:17:30.591,00:17:31.843,Oh. Are you sick?
00:17:31.843,00:17:33.761,"Oh, no, no, I'm fine."
00:17:33.761,00:17:35.638,Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff.
00:17:35.638,00:17:40.518,I was just exercising. I taped 20 Minute Workout on my machine and played it back at high-speed so it only took 10 minutes.
00:17:40.518,00:17:42.102,I got a great workout.
00:17:42.102,00:17:44.104,You want to come in for a mineral water or something?
00:17:44.104,00:17:47.233,"Oh, I'd really like to, um, Louis, but I have to go to a rehearsal now."
00:17:47.233,00:17:48.526,Excuse me.
00:17:48.526,00:17:50.236,I'll take a rain check on that.
00:17:50.236,00:17:53.531,I always have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods in the house.
00:17:53.531,00:17:55.742,But you already know that.
00:17:55.742,00:17:58.870,"Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients."
00:17:58.870,00:18:00.621,"My fourth anniversary as an accountant, you know."
00:18:00.621,00:18:05.835,"And even though you do your own tax return, which you shouldn't do, I'd like you to stop by, being that you're my neighbor and all."
00:18:05.835,00:18:07.211,"Well, thank you, Louis, I'll really try."
00:18:07.211,00:18:08.796,That reminds me.
00:18:08.796,00:18:11.049,You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.
00:18:11.049,00:18:12.633,The creep down the hall phoned the manager.
00:18:12.633,00:18:14.427,That's strange.
00:18:14.427,00:18:15.970,You know what I did?
00:18:15.970,00:18:22.060,"I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable, but I couldn't get in, so, you know what I did?"
00:18:19.306,00:18:23.561,"I turned up my TV real loud too, so everyone would think..."
00:18:23.561,00:18:25.104,...that both our TVs had something wrong with them.
00:18:25.104,00:18:26.981,"Okay, so I'll see you later, huh?"
00:18:26.981,00:18:28.858,I'll give you a call.
00:18:28.858,00:18:31.736,I've gotta have a shower.
00:18:35.949,00:18:38.993,Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
00:18:38.993,00:18:42.038,Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
00:18:42.038,00:18:45.792,"Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter, or ghost?"
00:18:45.792,00:18:47.877,"RAY: If the answer is yes, then don't wait another minute."
00:18:47.877,00:18:49.879,Pick up your phone and call the professionals.
00:18:49.879,00:18:51.756,Ghostbusters!
00:18:51.756,00:18:56.343,Our courteous and efficient staff is on call 24 hours a day to serve all your supernatural elimination needs.
00:18:56.343,00:18:59.097,ALL: We're ready to believe you.
00:19:45.977,00:19:47.520,Oh!
00:20:11.210,00:20:13.087,Zuul!
00:20:15.923,00:20:18.843,"VENKMAN: You don't think it's too subtle, Marty?"
00:20:18.843,00:20:22.429,You don't think people are gonna drive down and not see the sign?
00:20:30.479,00:20:32.982,You can't park that here.
00:20:36.819,00:20:39.697,Everybody can relax.
00:20:39.697,00:20:46.913,"Needs some suspension work and shocks, and, uh, brakes, brake pads, linings, steering box, transmission, rear end..."
00:20:46.913,00:20:48.539,Only $4800.
00:20:48.539,00:20:51.209,"Maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring."
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.339,"Janine, any calls?"
00:20:57.339,00:21:00.551,Any messages?
00:21:00.551,00:21:02.053,Any customers?
00:21:02.053,00:21:04.638,"No, Dr. Venkman."
00:21:04.638,00:21:07.266,"It's a good job, isn't it?"
00:21:08.851,00:21:10.728,"Type something, will you?"
00:21:10.728,00:21:12.605,Don't stare at me.
00:21:12.605,00:21:15.983,You've got them bug eyes.
00:21:15.983,00:21:17.193,Janine?
00:21:17.193,00:21:18.694,Sorry about the bug-eyes thing.
00:21:18.694,00:21:20.821,I'll be in my office.
00:21:23.323,00:21:26.285,You're very handy.
00:21:28.162,00:21:30.539,I bet you like to read a lot too.
00:21:30.539,00:21:31.958,Print is dead.
00:21:31.958,00:21:34.668,"Oh, that's very fascinating to me."
00:21:34.668,00:21:36.295,I read a lot myself.
00:21:36.295,00:21:41.341,"Some people think I'm too intellectual, but I think it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time."
00:21:41.341,00:21:43.219,I also play racketball.
00:21:43.219,00:21:44.971,Do you have any hobbies?
00:21:46.847,00:21:49.892,"I collect spores, molds and fungus."
00:21:54.230,00:21:56.315,Hello?
00:22:13.207,00:22:15.501,"Oh, excuse me."
00:22:15.501,00:22:17.544,This is the Ghostbusters office?
00:22:17.544,00:22:18.796,"Yes, it is."
00:22:18.796,00:22:20.131,Can I help you?
00:22:20.131,00:22:21.924,I don't have an appointment.
00:22:21.924,00:22:25.427,"I'd like to talk to someone, please."
00:22:25.427,00:22:27.680,I'm Peter Venkman.
00:22:27.680,00:22:28.889,May I help you?
00:22:28.889,00:22:31.976,"Um, well, uh, I don't know."
00:22:31.976,00:22:34.728,What I have to say may sound a little unusual.
00:22:34.728,00:22:37.940,"Oh, that's all we get day in, day out around this place."
00:22:37.940,00:22:40.026,"Come into my office, Miss..."
00:22:40.026,00:22:42.195,"Uh, Barrett, Dana Barrett."
00:22:42.195,00:22:43.904,"And this voice said, Zuul."
00:22:43.904,00:22:45.739,And then I slammed the refrigerator door and I left.
00:22:45.739,00:22:49.785,"That was two days ago, and I haven't been back to my apartment."
00:22:49.785,00:22:53.164,"Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance."
00:22:53.164,00:22:54.623,What do you think it was?
00:22:54.623,00:22:56.876,"Well, if I knew what it was, I wouldn't be here."
00:22:56.876,00:22:58.252,"Egon, what do you think?"
00:22:58.252,00:23:00.171,She's telling the truth.
00:23:00.171,00:23:01.839,At least she thinks she is.
00:23:01.839,00:23:04.466,"DANA: Well, of course I'm telling the truth."
00:23:04.466,00:23:07.220,What--? Who would make up a story like that?
00:23:07.220,00:23:09.013,VENKMAN: Some are people who just want attention.
00:23:09.013,00:23:11.265,Others are just nutballs who come in off the street.
00:23:11.265,00:23:12.725,You know what it could be?
00:23:12.725,00:23:15.311,Past-life experience intruding on present time.
00:23:15.311,00:23:19.273,EGON: Could be erased memories stored in the collective unconscious.
00:23:19.273,00:23:21.734,I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
00:23:21.734,00:23:23.110,I'm sorry.
00:23:23.110,00:23:24.862,I don't believe in any of those things.
00:23:24.862,00:23:27.198,"Well, that's all right."
00:23:27.198,00:23:32.661,"But there are some things we do, standard procedures in a case like this, which often bring us results."
00:23:32.661,00:23:36.707,"Well, I could go to Hall of Records and check out the structural details in the building."
00:23:36.707,00:23:38.334,Maybe the building itself has a history of psychic turbulence.
00:23:38.334,00:23:40.127,Right. Good idea.
00:23:40.127,00:23:42.504,EGON: I could look for the name Zuul in the usual literature.
00:23:42.504,00:23:44.173,Spates Catalog.
00:23:44.173,00:23:46.092,Yeah.
00:23:46.092,00:23:49.220,I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out.
00:23:49.220,00:23:52.472,I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay?
00:23:52.472,00:23:54.516,Okay.
00:23:56.727,00:23:58.436,Thank you.
00:24:06.987,00:24:08.864,"Please, let me."
00:24:08.864,00:24:13.493,"If something's gonna happen here, I want it to happen to me first."
00:24:16.663,00:24:18.874,DANA: That's the closet.
00:24:25.965,00:24:27.758,VENKMAN: They hate this.
00:24:28.968,00:24:30.677,I like to torture 'em.
00:24:30.677,00:24:34.265,"That's right, boys."
00:24:40.354,00:24:43.274,A lot of space.
00:24:43.274,00:24:45.109,Just you?
00:24:45.109,00:24:46.860,Yes.
00:24:46.860,00:24:48.528,Good.
00:24:51.698,00:24:54.952,What is that thing you're doing?
00:24:54.952,00:24:56.703,It's technical.
00:24:56.703,00:24:58.622,It's one of our little toys.
00:24:58.622,00:24:59.999,I see.
00:25:02.376,00:25:06.339,"That's the bedroom, but nothing ever happened in there."
00:25:09.675,00:25:11.802,What a crime.
00:25:13.095,00:25:16.015,"You know, you don't act like a scientist."
00:25:16.015,00:25:18.351,They're usually pretty stiff.
00:25:18.351,00:25:21.479,You're more like a game show host.
00:25:27.067,00:25:29.695,"That's the kitchen, huh?"
00:25:42.041,00:25:44.126,"Dana, are these the eggs?"
00:25:44.126,00:25:45.336,Yes.
00:25:45.336,00:25:50.049,"You see, I was over there, and these eggs just jumped right out of their shells and started to cook on the counter."
00:25:50.049,00:25:51.549,That is weird.
00:25:50.049,00:25:55.971,And that's when I started to hear that awful noise coming from the refrigerator.
00:25:55.971,00:25:58.182,"Dr. Venkman, you've come all this way."
00:25:58.182,00:26:01.227,Would you like to check the refrigerator?
00:26:01.227,00:26:03.729,Better check the fridge.
00:26:03.729,00:26:06.065,Good call.
00:26:10.152,00:26:12.988,"Oh, my God."
00:26:12.988,00:26:15.533,Look at all the junk food.
00:26:15.533,00:26:17.868,"No, goddamn it."
00:26:15.533,00:26:19.412,"Look, this wasn't-- You actually eat this stuff?"
00:26:19.412,00:26:21.205,"Look, this wasn't here."
00:26:21.205,00:26:28.795,"There was a space, and there was a-- A building or something with flames coming out of it, and there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling."
00:26:28.795,00:26:31.882,"And there were flames, and I heard a voice say Zuul."
00:26:31.882,00:26:33.092,It was right here.
00:26:33.092,00:26:34.343,I'm sorry.
00:26:34.343,00:26:35.635,I'm just not getting any reading.
00:26:35.635,00:26:38.180,"Well, are you sure you're using that thing correctly?"
00:26:38.180,00:26:40.015,"Well, it's not-- I think so."
00:26:40.015,00:26:42.518,But I'm sure there are no animals in there.
00:26:42.518,00:26:43.852,"Well, that's great."
00:26:43.852,00:26:46.980,"Either I have a monster in my kitchen, or I'm completely crazy."
00:26:46.980,00:26:49.691,I don't think you're crazy.
00:26:49.691,00:26:50.901,"Oh, good."
00:26:50.901,00:26:53.070,That makes me feel so much better.
00:26:55.613,00:26:57.241,Let me tell you something about myself.
00:26:57.241,00:27:00.994,"I come home from work to my place, and all I have is my work."
00:27:00.994,00:27:02.288,There's nothing else in my life.
00:27:02.288,00:27:07.209,"Dr. Venkman-- I meet you, and I say, My God, there's someone with the same problem I have."
00:27:07.209,00:27:09.920,"Yes, we both have the same problem. You."
00:27:14.007,00:27:17.219,I'm gonna go for broke.
00:27:18.971,00:27:20.806,I am madly in love with you.
00:27:20.806,00:27:22.182,I don't believe this.
00:27:22.182,00:27:23.767,Will you please leave?
00:27:23.767,00:27:26.562,And then she threw me out of her life.
00:27:26.562,00:27:28.105,She thought I was a creep.
00:27:28.105,00:27:31.275,"She thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first."
00:27:31.275,00:27:33.110,You are so odd.
00:27:36.989,00:27:38.324,No.
00:27:38.324,00:27:40.033,I've got it.
00:27:40.033,00:27:41.327,"No, no, no, no, no..."
00:27:41.327,00:27:43.120,I'll prove myself to you.
00:27:43.120,00:27:44.538,That's not necessary.
00:27:44.538,00:27:46.706,"Yeah, I'll solve your little problem."
00:27:46.706,00:27:48.834,Okay.
00:27:46.706,00:27:50.961,"And then you'll say, Pete Venkman's a guy who can get things done."
00:27:50.961,00:27:52.338,Right.
00:27:52.338,00:27:53.671,I wonder what makes him tick.
00:27:53.671,00:27:58.010,I wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick.
00:27:58.010,00:28:00.846,I'll bet you're gonna be thinking about me after I'm gone.
00:28:00.846,00:28:03.140,I bet I am.
00:28:03.140,00:28:04.517,No kiss?
00:28:14.901,00:28:16.654,To our first customer.
00:28:16.654,00:28:19.532,To our first and only customer.
00:28:20.782,00:28:22.993,I'm gonna need to draw some petty cash.
00:28:22.993,00:28:25.579,I should take her out to dinner.
00:28:25.579,00:28:31.293,"Uh, this magnificent feast here represents the last of the petty cash."
00:28:33.170,00:28:35.922,"Hey, slow down."
00:28:36.882,00:28:39.092,Hello. Ghostbusters.
00:28:39.092,00:28:42.221,"Yes, of course they're serious."
00:28:44.515,00:28:46.475,You do?
00:28:46.475,00:28:48.310,You have?
00:28:48.310,00:28:50.229,No kidding?
00:28:50.229,00:28:51.564,Uh-huh.
00:28:51.564,00:28:54.774,"Well, just, uh-- Just give me the address."
00:28:54.774,00:28:56.235,"Uh-huh. Yes, of course."
00:28:56.235,00:28:58.862,"Oh, they'll be totally discreet."
00:29:00.489,00:29:02.908,Thank you.
00:29:02.908,00:29:05.244,We got one!
00:29:09.707,00:29:11.375,It's a call!
00:29:55.168,00:29:57.129,"Hey, anybody see a ghost?"
00:30:01.967,00:30:03.719,"MAN: Uh, thank you for coming so quickly."
00:30:03.719,00:30:05.095,Jesus!
00:30:05.095,00:30:07.931,"The guests are starting to ask questions, and I'm running out of excuses."
00:30:07.931,00:30:09.725,Has it happened before?
00:30:09.725,00:30:12.060,"Well, most of the original staff knows about the 12th floor."
00:30:12.060,00:30:14.229,Uh-huh.
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.731,"Um, but it's been quiet for years."
00:30:15.731,00:30:17.023,Up until two weeks ago.
00:30:17.023,00:30:18.567,"It was never, ever this bad, though."
00:30:18.567,00:30:20.527,Did you ever report it to anyone?
00:30:20.527,00:30:23.363,"No. Heavens, no."
00:30:23.363,00:30:25.282,The owners don't like us to even talk about it.
00:30:25.282,00:30:26.659,No.
00:30:26.659,00:30:28.368,I hoped we could take care of this quietly.
00:30:28.368,00:30:29.703,It's done.
00:30:29.703,00:30:31.246,"Yes, sir."
00:30:31.246,00:30:33.540,We handle this kind of thing all the time.
00:30:41.757,00:30:45.051,"What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut?"
00:30:45.051,00:30:47.179,"Heh. No, we're exterminators."
00:30:47.179,00:30:49.097,Somebody saw a cockroach up on 12.
00:30:49.097,00:30:51.850,That's gotta be some cockroach.
00:30:51.850,00:30:54.436,"Bite your head off, man."
00:30:57.690,00:30:59.399,Going up?
00:30:59.399,00:31:01.360,I'll take the next one.
00:31:03.696,00:31:05.364,"You know, it's just occurred to me."
00:31:05.364,00:31:08.575,We really haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment.
00:31:08.575,00:31:10.202,I blame myself.
00:31:10.202,00:31:12.287,"Well, no sense worrying about it now."
00:31:12.287,00:31:13.539,Why worry?
00:31:13.539,00:31:18.043,Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back.
00:31:18.043,00:31:19.837,Yep.
00:31:19.837,00:31:21.296,"Well, let's get ready."
00:31:21.296,00:31:23.340,Switch me on.
00:31:52.285,00:31:54.913,VENKMAN: Whoa! Hold it.
00:31:58.751,00:32:01.253,What the hell are you doing?
00:32:02.295,00:32:03.380,Sorry.
00:32:03.380,00:32:04.964,Sorry.
00:32:04.964,00:32:06.675,We thought you were someone else.
00:32:09.010,00:32:11.054,Successful test.
00:32:11.054,00:32:12.848,I guess so.
00:32:12.848,00:32:15.434,Uh... I think we'd better split up.
00:32:15.434,00:32:16.685,Good idea.
00:32:16.685,00:32:18.896,"Yeah, we can do more damage that way."
00:32:46.423,00:32:47.883,Venkman?
00:32:47.883,00:32:49.593,Venkman!
00:32:56.975,00:32:59.478,Disgusting blob.
00:32:59.478,00:33:02.063,I'm gonna have to hold him myself.
00:33:43.605,00:33:46.191,"Come in, Ray."
00:33:47.526,00:33:50.487,"Venkman, I saw it."
00:33:50.487,00:33:52.656,"It's right here, Ray."
00:33:52.656,00:33:54.366,It's looking at me.
00:33:54.366,00:33:56.535,"RAY: He's an ugly little spud, isn't he?"
00:33:56.535,00:33:58.036,"I think he can hear you, Ray."
00:33:58.036,00:34:00.330,Don't move. It won't hurt you.
00:34:00.330,00:34:01.498,Aah!
00:34:07.420,00:34:09.548,Venkman!
00:34:11.341,00:34:14.427,"Venkman, speak!"
00:34:16.221,00:34:18.932,"Venkman, what happened?"
00:34:18.932,00:34:20.475,He slimed me.
00:34:20.475,00:34:24.103,That's great!
00:34:24.103,00:34:25.522,Can you move?
00:34:25.522,00:34:27.024,"EGON: Ray, Ray."
00:34:27.024,00:34:28.400,I feel so funky.
00:34:28.400,00:34:30.610,"Spengler, I'm with Venkman."
00:34:30.610,00:34:32.111,He got slimed.
00:34:32.111,00:34:34.698,"That's great, Ray."
00:34:34.698,00:34:36.033,Get down here right away.
00:34:36.033,00:34:37.367,It just went into a ballroom.
00:34:37.367,00:34:38.952,"Okay, we'll be right there."
00:34:41.538,00:34:47.002,"Okay, sir, if you and your staff could please wait out here, we'll take care of everything."
00:35:04.770,00:35:06.187,RAY: There it is.
00:35:06.187,00:35:08.106,On the ceiling.
00:35:10.025,00:35:11.985,That's the one that got me.
00:35:20.035,00:35:21.494,"All right, boys."
00:35:21.494,00:35:24.247,Ready? Throw it.
00:35:34.299,00:35:35.884,RAY: I did that. I did that.
00:35:35.884,00:35:37.218,That's my fault.
00:35:37.218,00:35:38.887,That's okay.
00:35:38.887,00:35:41.098,There's something very important I forgot to tell you.
00:35:41.098,00:35:42.474,VENKMAN: What?
00:35:42.474,00:35:44.225,Don't cross the streams.
00:35:44.225,00:35:45.936,Why?
00:35:45.936,00:35:47.186,It would be bad.
00:35:47.186,00:35:49.606,I'm fuzzy on the whole good-bad thing.
00:35:49.606,00:35:51.066,"What do you mean, bad?"
00:35:51.066,00:35:57.196,Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light.
00:35:57.196,00:35:59.532,Total protonic reversal.
00:35:59.532,00:36:01.034,Right. That's bad.
00:36:01.034,00:36:03.120,"Okay. All right, important safety tip."
00:36:03.120,00:36:04.746,"Thanks, Egon. All right."
00:36:04.746,00:36:07.206,"Ray, take the left."
00:36:14.089,00:36:17.134,"VENKMAN: Okay, Ray, just give me one high and outside."
00:36:17.134,00:36:18.426,Ray!
00:36:21.847,00:36:23.640,Egon!
00:36:31.064,00:36:32.607,"Okay, all right, all right."
00:36:32.607,00:36:35.276,"Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it!"
00:36:35.276,00:36:36.611,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:36:36.611,00:36:38.279,"Nice shooting, Tex."
00:36:38.279,00:36:41.282,"I assure you, Mrs. Van Hoffman, there is no problem with the room."
00:36:41.282,00:36:43.618,It will be ready promptly as soon as your guests are with us.
00:36:43.618,00:36:46.079,"The last throw took something out of him, but he's gonna move."
00:36:46.079,00:36:47.372,I need room to put the trap down.
00:36:47.372,00:36:48.623,Give me some room.
00:36:49.833,00:36:51.168,"You'll excuse me, please."
00:36:57.883,00:36:59.592,We've gotta get this in the clear.
00:36:59.592,00:37:01.469,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:37:01.469,00:37:03.889,I've always wanted to do this.
00:37:03.889,00:37:05.932,And...
00:37:05.932,00:37:07.600,the flowers are still standing!
00:37:07.600,00:37:09.019,"Okay, on my go-signal."
00:37:09.019,00:37:10.603,"Spengler, I want a confinement stream from you."
00:37:10.603,00:37:12.064,Okay? Go.
00:37:12.064,00:37:14.900,Okay. Hold him up there.
00:37:14.900,00:37:16.651,Hold him up. Go.
00:37:18.195,00:37:20.739,"It's working, Ray."
00:37:20.739,00:37:22.074,You've got him.
00:37:22.074,00:37:26.494,"Maybe now you'll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh?"
00:37:26.494,00:37:28.914,"Venkman, shorten your stream."
00:37:30.082,00:37:31.499,"All right, I'm opening the trap now."
00:37:31.499,00:37:32.876,Don't look directly into the trap.
00:37:34.252,00:37:35.879,"I looked at the trap, Ray."
00:37:35.879,00:37:38.090,Turn your streams off as soon as I close the trap.
00:37:38.090,00:37:41.218,Get ready.
00:38:00.195,00:38:01.947,It's in there.
00:38:01.947,00:38:03.949,Hey.
00:38:05.617,00:38:08.120,"Well, that wasn't such a chore, now, was it?"
00:38:10.163,00:38:11.831,"Mr. Smith, quickly."
00:38:11.831,00:38:13.208,I want that door open now.
00:38:13.208,00:38:15.001,"Donald, stand over there."
00:38:15.001,00:38:18.463,"We came, we saw, we kicked its ass."
00:38:18.463,00:38:20.048,Did you see it?
00:38:20.048,00:38:22.050,We got it!
00:38:22.050,00:38:23.718,Will there be any more of them?
00:38:23.718,00:38:31.017,"Sir, what you had there was what we refer to as a focused, non-terminal repeating phantasm or a class-five full-roaming vapor."
00:38:31.017,00:38:32.852,A real nasty one too.
00:38:32.852,00:38:34.353,"And now, ahem."
00:38:34.353,00:38:36.064,Let's talk seriously.
00:38:36.064,00:38:40.860,"Now, for the entrapment we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000 for that."
00:38:40.860,00:38:45.031,But we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast.
00:38:45.031,00:38:47.867,"And that's only gonna come to $1000, fortunately."
00:38:47.867,00:38:49.702,Five thousand dollars?
00:38:49.702,00:38:51.288,I had no idea it'd be so much. I won't pay it.
00:38:51.288,00:38:52.538,That's all right.
00:38:52.538,00:38:54.332,We can just put it right back in there.
00:38:54.332,00:38:55.500,Thank you.
00:38:55.500,00:38:56.835,"We certainly can, Dr. Venkman."
00:38:56.835,00:38:58.128,"No, no, no. No!"
00:38:58.128,00:39:00.046,All right. Anything.
00:39:00.046,00:39:01.589,Thanks so much.
00:39:01.589,00:39:03.175,Thank you. Hope we can help you again.
00:39:03.175,00:39:05.010,"Coming through. One class-five, free-roaming vapor."
00:39:05.010,00:39:06.427,Move 'em out.
00:39:06.427,00:39:08.138,Good morning.

00:39:21.776,00:39:27.406,"Heck, my grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive that would rocket past the farm where she grew up."
00:39:27.406,00:39:28.908,"But now, as if some unforeseen authority..."
00:39:50.180,00:39:52.182,"Stand aside, please!"

00:39:58.021,00:40:03.193,Some maintain that these professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all.
00:40:09.908,00:40:13.078,I got it! I got it!

00:41:59.725,00:42:01.811,"Oh, I gotta get some sleep."
00:42:01.811,00:42:03.562,I'm dying.
00:42:03.562,00:42:05.064,You don't look good.
00:42:05.064,00:42:06.399,I don't?
00:42:06.399,00:42:07.942,"Well, you've looked better."
00:42:07.942,00:42:09.402,You didn't used to look like this.
00:42:09.402,00:42:11.029,"Yes. Can you hold, please?"
00:42:11.029,00:42:12.947,Here's the paper on the Brooklyn.
00:42:12.947,00:42:14.115,She paid with Visa.
00:42:14.115,00:42:15.867,Here's tonight's worksheet.
00:42:15.867,00:42:17.035,"Oh, great."
00:42:17.035,00:42:18.744,Two more free repeaters.
00:42:18.744,00:42:20.955,This is Winston Zeddmore.
00:42:20.955,00:42:22.499,Beautiful.
00:42:22.499,00:42:24.125,"Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman."
00:42:24.125,00:42:25.584,Congratulations.
00:42:25.584,00:42:26.961,"Can you help me, please?"
00:42:31.049,00:42:32.842,Welcome aboard.
00:42:32.842,00:42:35.678,I don't know where they get these guest conductors.
00:42:35.678,00:42:39.557,"I mean, someone should tell him it's not gonna do him much good to scream at us in German."
00:42:39.557,00:42:44.645,"Well, I don't think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra."
00:42:44.645,00:42:47.399,"Um, could you wait here a minute?"
00:42:47.399,00:42:49.442,"Huh? Uh, sure."
00:42:55.823,00:42:58.117,"Dr. Venkman, this is a surprise."
00:42:58.117,00:43:00.036,That was a wonderful rehearsal.
00:43:00.036,00:43:01.287,You heard that?
00:43:01.287,00:43:03.039,Yes. You're the best one in your row.
00:43:03.039,00:43:04.874,"Oh, thank you."
00:43:04.874,00:43:07.877,Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.
00:43:07.877,00:43:10.588,"Aw, I don't have to take this abuse from you."
00:43:10.588,00:43:12.173,I got hundreds of people dying to abuse me.
00:43:12.173,00:43:13.425,I know.
00:43:13.425,00:43:14.926,You're a big celebrity now.
00:43:14.926,00:43:17.011,Do you have some information for me on my case?
00:43:22.058,00:43:23.809,Who's the stiff?
00:43:23.809,00:43:28.106,The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world.
00:43:28.106,00:43:30.442,"I mean, do you have some information for me, please?"
00:43:30.442,00:43:32.944,"Sure, but I prefer to give it to you in private."
00:43:32.944,00:43:34.446,Why don't you tell me now?
00:43:34.446,00:43:35.988,"Well, okay, I found the name Zuul for you."
00:43:35.988,00:43:40.368,"Well, the name Zuul refers to a demigod worshiped around 6000 B.C."
00:43:40.368,00:43:43.413,by the...
00:43:43.413,00:43:44.705,Hittites.
00:43:44.705,00:43:49.710,"Hittites, the Mesopotamians, and the Sumerians."
00:43:49.710,00:43:52.671,Zuul was the minion of Gozer.
00:43:52.671,00:43:55.674,What's Gozer?
00:43:55.674,00:43:57.260,Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
00:43:57.260,00:43:58.928,"Well, what's he doing in my icebox?"
00:43:58.928,00:44:00.263,I'm working on that.
00:44:00.263,00:44:06.519,"If we could get together Thursday night, I'm thinking 9-ish, you know, we could exchange information."
00:44:06.519,00:44:07.686,I can't see you Thursday.
00:44:07.686,00:44:09.564,I'm-- I'm-- I'm busy.
00:44:09.564,00:44:18.573,"Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says, in your mind, He enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients."
00:44:18.573,00:44:22.368,No. I'm making a special exception in your case because...
00:44:22.368,00:44:23.828,I respect you.
00:44:23.828,00:44:25.746,"It's corny, but I respect you as an artist."
00:44:25.746,00:44:27.081,And as a dresser too.
00:44:27.081,00:44:29.708,This is a magnificent coordination you have going here today.
00:44:29.708,00:44:31.877,"Okay, I'll, uh-- I'll see you Thursday."
00:44:31.877,00:44:34.755,"I'll bring the Roylance Guide, and we'll eat and read."
00:44:41.762,00:44:43.181,So who the hell is that?
00:44:43.181,00:44:44.516,He's just a friend.
00:44:44.516,00:44:45.850,A friend?
00:44:45.850,00:44:47.935,"Goodbye! Well, I'll see you Thursday."
00:44:47.935,00:44:51.063,"I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir, and I'm glad you're feeling much better."
00:44:51.063,00:44:52.689,"You're still very pale, though."
00:44:52.689,00:44:54.651,A little sun!
00:44:54.651,00:44:55.901,"Well, what does he do?"
00:44:55.901,00:44:57.570,"Oh, he's a scientist."
00:45:07.830,00:45:12.751,RAY: This is where we store all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap.
00:45:12.751,00:45:14.212,"Very simple, really."
00:45:14.212,00:45:15.672,A loaded trap here.
00:45:15.672,00:45:18.257,"Open, unlock the system."
00:45:18.257,00:45:20.092,Insert the trap.
00:45:21.219,00:45:23.095,Release.
00:45:24.681,00:45:26.307,"Close, lock the system."
00:45:26.307,00:45:28.309,Set your entry grid.
00:45:28.309,00:45:30.061,Neutronize your field.
00:45:30.061,00:45:32.313,And...
00:45:32.313,00:45:35.233,"When the light is green, the trap is clean."
00:45:35.233,00:45:37.985,The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom-made storage facility.
00:45:37.985,00:45:40.572,There's a man from the EPA here to see you.
00:45:40.572,00:45:42.114,He's waiting in your office.
00:45:42.114,00:45:43.366,EPA? What's he want?
00:45:43.366,00:45:44.617,I don't know.
00:45:44.617,00:45:49.955,"All I do know is that I've been working two weeks without a break, and you promised me you'd hire more help."
00:45:49.955,00:45:52.749,"Janine, someone with your qualifications..."
00:45:54.210,00:45:59.591,...would have no trouble finding a top-flight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries.
00:45:59.591,00:46:02.134,Are you gonna answer that?
00:46:02.134,00:46:05.762,I've quit better jobs than this.
00:46:05.762,00:46:07.764,Ghostbusters.
00:46:07.764,00:46:08.974,Can I help you?
00:46:08.974,00:46:10.268,I'm Walter Peck.
00:46:10.268,00:46:14.021,"I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, the third district."
00:46:14.021,00:46:15.189,Great.
00:46:15.189,00:46:18.317,How's it going down there?
00:46:18.317,00:46:20.486,Are you Peter Venkman?
00:46:20.486,00:46:25.283,"Yes, I'm..."
00:46:25.283,00:46:27.784,"Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?"
00:46:27.784,00:46:31.830,"Well, I have PhDs in parapsychology and psychology."
00:46:31.830,00:46:33.916,I see.
00:46:33.916,00:46:36.835,And now you catch ghosts.
00:46:36.835,00:46:39.213,Yeah.
00:46:39.213,00:46:42.592,"And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?"
00:46:42.592,00:46:44.009,I'm not at liberty to say.
00:46:44.009,00:46:48.431,And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
00:46:48.431,00:46:50.391,Into a storage facility.
00:46:50.391,00:46:54.687,And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
00:46:54.687,00:46:55.938,Yes.
00:46:55.938,00:46:59.484,And may I see this storage facility?
00:46:59.484,00:47:00.735,No.
00:47:00.735,00:47:03.028,"And why not, Mr. Venkman?"
00:47:03.028,00:47:07.659,Because you did not use the magic word.
00:47:09.118,00:47:13.790,"What is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?"
00:47:14.957,00:47:16.334,Please.
00:47:16.334,00:47:21.922,"May I please see the storage facility, Mr. Venkman?"
00:47:21.922,00:47:23.966,Why do you want to see the storage facility?
00:47:23.966,00:47:25.677,"Well, because I'm curious."
00:47:25.677,00:47:28.220,I want to know more about what you do here.
00:47:28.220,00:47:35.894,"Frankly, there've been a lot of wild stories in the media, and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation."
00:47:35.894,00:47:41.567,"For instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement."
00:47:41.567,00:47:45.904,"Now, you either show me what is down there, or I come back with a court order."
00:47:45.904,00:47:48.032,You go get a court order.
00:47:48.032,00:47:50.909,And I'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution.
00:47:50.909,00:47:54.831,"You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman."
00:47:54.831,00:47:59.752,"I'm worried, Ray. It's getting crowded in there, and all my recent data points to something big on the horizon."
00:47:59.752,00:48:01.878,"What do you mean, big?"
00:48:01.878,00:48:09.886,"Well, let's say this Twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the New York area."
00:48:09.886,00:48:18.062,"According to this morning's sample, it would be a Twinkie 35-feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds."
00:48:19.271,00:48:20.523,That's a big Twinkie.
00:48:20.523,00:48:26.362,"RAY: We could be on the verge of a four-fold cross-rip, a PKE surge of incredible, even dangerous proportions."
00:48:26.362,00:48:30.616,We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency.
00:48:30.616,00:48:32.451,How's the grid holding up?
00:48:32.451,00:48:33.703,It's not good.
00:48:33.703,00:48:35.120,Tell him about the Twinkie.
00:48:35.120,00:48:38.123,What about the Twinkie?
00:49:33.095,00:49:34.639,"Oh, Dana, it's you."
00:49:34.639,00:49:35.932,"Hello, Louis."
00:49:35.932,00:49:37.141,You gotta come in here.
00:49:37.141,00:49:38.392,You're missing a classic party.
00:49:38.392,00:49:42.772,"Yes, well, I would, Louis, but I have a date coming over."
00:49:46.066,00:49:47.652,You made a date...
00:49:47.652,00:49:48.903,tonight?
00:49:48.903,00:49:51.988,"Well, I-- I-- I'm sorry, Louis."
00:49:51.988,00:49:54.116,I forgot.
00:49:55.033,00:49:56.953,"Oh, that's okay."
00:49:56.953,00:49:58.370,You can bring him along.
00:49:58.370,00:50:02.374,"All right, maybe we'll stop by, okay?"
00:50:02.374,00:50:03.751,That's great.
00:50:03.751,00:50:05.127,I'll tell everybody you're coming.
00:50:05.127,00:50:07.922,"We're gonna play Twister, and we're gonna do some break-dancing."
00:50:07.922,00:50:10.382,"Hey, ev-- Hey, let me in!"
00:50:11.843,00:50:14.470,It's Louis.
00:50:38.995,00:50:40.663,Hello?
00:50:40.663,00:50:42.414,"Oh, hi, Mom."
00:50:42.414,00:50:44.834,"Um, I've been busy."
00:50:44.834,00:50:47.670,"Well, uh, no, everything is fine."
00:50:47.670,00:50:51.131,"Yeah, I know, just that, um-- That one time."
00:50:51.131,00:50:53.843,"Oh, I am."
00:50:53.843,00:50:55.970,I will.
00:50:57.179,00:51:00.016,I won't.
00:51:00.016,00:51:02.100,I have a date.
00:51:02.100,00:51:03.394,Yes.
00:51:03.394,00:51:05.061,"No, uh, no one you know."
00:51:05.061,00:51:10.234,"It's, uh-- Well, he's, uh-- He's a Ghostbuster."
00:51:10.234,00:51:13.320,Those guys on TV.
00:51:13.320,00:51:15.823,"Yes, well, I'll have to let you know."
00:51:15.823,00:51:18.283,Okay. Love to Dad.
00:51:18.283,00:51:19.952,Right. Bye.
00:51:19.952,00:51:21.579,Bye.
00:51:42.182,00:51:43.851,"Oh, shit."
00:51:53.360,00:51:55.279,No!
00:52:15.925,00:52:19.720,Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol?
00:52:19.720,00:52:22.389,"Gee, I think all I got is the acetylsalicylic acid, generic."
00:52:22.389,00:52:26.560,"See, I can get 600 tablets of that for the same price as 300 of the name-brand."
00:52:26.560,00:52:29.271,It makes good financial sense.
00:52:29.271,00:52:33.734,"Hey, this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada-- $24.95 a pound."
00:52:33.734,00:52:35.486,"Only cost me $14.12 after tax, though."
00:52:35.486,00:52:37.822,I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense.
00:52:37.822,00:52:40.074,That's why I invited clients instead of friends.
00:52:40.074,00:52:42.701,"You having a good time, Art?"
00:52:42.701,00:52:44.703,Why don't you have some brie?
00:52:44.703,00:52:46.664,You think it's too warm in here for the brie?
00:52:46.664,00:52:48.164,"Louis, I'm going home."
00:52:48.164,00:52:50.042,"Oh, don't leave yet."
00:52:50.042,00:52:53.129,"Listen, maybe if we start dancing, other people will join in."
00:52:53.129,00:52:54.964,Okay.
00:52:58.550,00:53:01.345,"Oh, don't move."
00:53:02.888,00:53:04.306,"Ted, Annette."
00:53:04.306,00:53:06.182,I'm glad you could come.
00:53:06.182,00:53:08.060,How are you doing?
00:53:08.060,00:53:10.021,"Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming."
00:53:10.021,00:53:11.772,Hi.
00:53:11.772,00:53:14.566,Ted has a small carpet-cleaning business in receivership.
00:53:14.566,00:53:17.945,Annette's drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago.
00:53:17.945,00:53:21.197,"They've got $15,000 left on the house at 8 percent."
00:53:22.449,00:53:24.284,So they're okay.
00:53:24.284,00:53:26.954,So does anybody want to play Parcheesi?
00:53:29.456,00:53:32.043,"Okay, who brought the dog?"
00:53:40.216,00:53:42.511,Help!
00:53:53.313,00:53:55.774,Help! There's a bear loose in my apartment.
00:53:55.774,00:53:57.026,Help. Help!
00:54:02.447,00:54:03.574,What?
00:54:03.574,00:54:06.160,A bear in his apartment.
00:54:09.955,00:54:11.999,I'm gonna bring this up at the next tenants' meeting.
00:54:11.999,00:54:15.627,There's not supposed to be any pets in the building.
00:54:28.599,00:54:31.185,Let me in.
00:54:31.185,00:54:36.982,There's gotta be a way in here.
00:54:31.185,00:54:41.612,"I gotta get-- Somebody, let me in!"
00:54:47.243,00:54:49.245,Nice doggie.
00:54:49.245,00:54:51.205,Cute little pooch.
00:54:51.205,00:54:53.415,Maybe I got a Milk-Bone.
00:55:13.477,00:55:15.479,"Hey, what happened?"
00:55:15.479,00:55:19.150,"Some moron brought a cougar to a party, and it went berserk."
00:55:19.150,00:55:23.028,"Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's."
00:55:23.028,00:55:24.989,Okay?
00:55:27.783,00:55:29.660,"MAN: Tully, how do you spell that?"
00:55:29.660,00:55:33.831,WOMAN: T-u-l-l-y.
00:55:33.831,00:55:35.040,Owner here?
00:55:35.040,00:55:36.374,No.
00:55:36.374,00:55:37.709,MAN 2: No. He ran out.
00:55:43.757,00:55:45.383,Hello?
00:55:47.636,00:55:50.346,"That's a different look for you, isn't it?"
00:55:50.346,00:55:53.433,SEXY VOICE: Are you the Keymaster?
00:55:54.559,00:55:57.062,Not that I know of.
00:56:08.364,00:56:10.909,Are you the Keymaster?
00:56:10.909,00:56:12.077,Yes.
00:56:12.077,00:56:13.578,I'm a friend of his.
00:56:13.578,00:56:16.165,He told me to meet him here.
00:56:16.165,00:56:17.708,I didn't get your name.
00:56:17.708,00:56:20.669,I am Zuul.
00:56:20.669,00:56:22.338,Oh.
00:56:25.966,00:56:27.968,"What are we doing today, Zuul?"
00:56:27.968,00:56:31.513,We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
00:56:31.513,00:56:33.640,"Gozer, huh?"
00:56:35.309,00:56:37.228,The Destructor.
00:56:44.818,00:56:46.653,Are we still going out?
00:56:48.404,00:56:53.118,"You know, you could pick up the place if you're expecting someone."
00:56:53.118,00:56:56.663,Do you want this body?
00:56:56.663,00:56:58.916,Is this a trick question?
00:57:01.877,00:57:04.380,"I guess the roses worked, huh?"
00:57:04.380,00:57:07.258,Take me now...
00:57:07.258,00:57:08.675,sub-creature.
00:57:08.675,00:57:10.719,We never talk anymore.
00:57:10.719,00:57:12.304,Whoa! Easy.
00:57:12.304,00:57:15.766,I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people.
00:57:17.184,00:57:21.230,"Actually, it's more of a guideline than a rule."
00:57:21.230,00:57:22.439,"You know, I can flip..."
00:57:22.439,00:57:25.025,I want you inside me.
00:57:26.651,00:57:28.946,"Go ahead. No, I can't."
00:57:26.651,00:57:30.572,Sounds like you got at least two people in there already.
00:57:30.572,00:57:32.324,Might be a little crowded.
00:57:32.324,00:57:33.533,"Come on, I... I..."
00:57:33.533,00:57:38.622,Why don't you just quit trying to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just relax?
00:57:38.622,00:57:40.207,Lie down there.
00:57:40.207,00:57:42.251,Put your hands on your chest.
00:57:42.251,00:57:45.337,What I'd really like to do is talk to Dana.
00:57:45.337,00:57:47.256,I want to talk to Dana.
00:57:47.256,00:57:49.091,Dana?
00:57:49.091,00:57:50.926,There is no Dana.
00:57:50.926,00:57:52.970,There is only Zuul.
00:57:52.970,00:57:55.055,"Oh, Zuulie, you nut."
00:57:55.055,00:57:56.765,Come on.
00:57:56.765,00:57:58.016,Dana.
00:57:58.016,00:58:00.352,Just relax. Come on. Dana.
00:58:00.352,00:58:02.229,Dana.
00:58:02.229,00:58:06.775,"There is no Dana, only Zuul."
00:58:06.775,00:58:09.111,What a lovely singing voice you must have.
00:58:09.111,00:58:11.238,"Now I'm gonna count to three, Zuulie."
00:58:11.238,00:58:16.493,"And if I don't get to talk to Dana, there's gonna be some real trouble in this apartment, I think."
00:58:16.493,00:58:17.911,One...
00:58:20.038,00:58:21.915,Two...
00:58:23.959,00:58:25.169,Two-and-a-half...
00:59:08.462,00:59:11.256,Please come down.
00:59:12.883,00:59:14.176,I am the Keymaster!
00:59:15.552,00:59:17.012,The Destructor will come!
00:59:19.223,00:59:21.141,I must seek out the Destroyer.
00:59:27.605,00:59:29.400,Gatekeeper.
00:59:35.113,00:59:36.365,I am Vinz.
00:59:36.365,00:59:41.537,"Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer-- Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia."
00:59:41.537,00:59:42.746,Are you the Gatekeeper?
00:59:42.746,00:59:44.039,"DRIVER: Hey, he pulls the wagon."
00:59:44.039,00:59:46.041,I make the deals.
00:59:53.882,00:59:55.800,Wait for the sign.
00:59:55.800,00:59:58.303,Then all prisoners will be released.
00:59:58.303,01:00:00.722,"You will perish in flame, you and all your kind."
01:00:00.722,01:00:02.599,Gatekeeper!
01:00:02.599,01:00:04.226,What an asshole.
01:00:09.814,01:00:12.192,Dropping off or picking up?
01:00:12.192,01:00:13.402,Dropping off.
01:00:13.402,01:00:15.195,Just a moment.
01:00:18.532,01:00:19.950,You a Ghostbuster?
01:00:19.950,01:00:21.826,EGON: Yes.
01:00:21.826,01:00:23.579,Now we don't know what to do with him.
01:00:23.579,01:00:26.248,"Bellevue doesn't want him, I'm afraid to put him in lock-up."
01:00:26.248,01:00:29.084,"I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we'd check with you."
01:00:29.084,01:00:31.211,EGON: All right.
01:00:32.796,01:00:35.673,Are you the Gatekeeper?
01:00:38.218,01:00:40.637,You'd better bring him inside.
01:00:41.888,01:00:44.516,You are so kind to take care of that man.
01:00:44.516,01:00:46.810,"You know, you are a real humanitarian."
01:00:46.810,01:00:49.687,I don't think he's human.
01:00:56.861,01:00:58.989,What did you say your name was?
01:00:58.989,01:01:02.867,"Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer."
01:01:02.867,01:01:04.828,"Well, according to this, his name's Louis Tully."
01:01:04.828,01:01:07.498,He lives on Central Park West.
01:01:08.999,01:01:11.460,"Do you want some, uh, coffee, Mr. Tully?"
01:01:11.460,01:01:13.711,Do I?
01:01:13.711,01:01:15.088,"Yes, have some."
01:01:16.798,01:01:20.260,"EGON: Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign."
01:01:20.260,01:01:22.304,What sign are you waiting for?
01:01:22.304,01:01:23.597,Gozer the Traveler.
01:01:23.597,01:01:25.849,He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms.
01:01:25.849,01:01:30.312,"During the rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as the large and moving Torb."
01:01:30.312,01:01:37.110,"Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the Meketrex supplicants, they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar!"
01:01:37.110,01:01:43.283,"Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you."
01:01:43.283,01:01:44.742,Egon?
01:01:44.742,01:01:46.911,Excuse me.
01:01:48.580,01:01:51.916,There's something very strange about that man.
01:01:53.918,01:01:58.590,"Listen, I'm usually very psychic, and I have a terrible feeling that something awful's gonna happen to you."
01:02:00.133,01:02:02.302,I'm afraid you're gonna die.
01:02:04.929,01:02:07.182,I'll get it.
01:02:09.059,01:02:10.310,Hello?
01:02:10.310,01:02:12.270,"Egon, it's Peter."
01:02:12.270,01:02:13.855,"Thanks, I've got it."
01:02:13.855,01:02:15.773,I have some news from the world of Gozer.
01:02:15.773,01:02:17.025,"EGON: What is it, Peter?"
01:02:17.025,01:02:18.610,I'm here with Dana Barrett.
01:02:18.610,01:02:23.198,It seems the Goze has been putting some moves on my would-be girlfriend.
01:02:23.198,01:02:24.866,How is she?
01:02:24.866,01:02:28.078,I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom.
01:02:28.078,01:02:31.873,I just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of Thorazine.
01:02:31.873,01:02:34.209,"She's gonna take a little nap now, but, uh..."
01:02:34.209,01:02:35.460,she says she's the Gatekeeper.
01:02:35.460,01:02:36.920,Does that make any sense to you?
01:02:36.920,01:02:38.505,Some.
01:02:38.505,01:02:41.007,I just met the Keymaster.
01:02:41.007,01:02:42.259,"Oh, wonderful."
01:02:42.259,01:02:44.261,We have to get these two together.
01:02:46.054,01:02:49.849,I think that would be extraordinarily dangerous.
01:02:49.849,01:02:52.728,"Okay, well, hold onto him."
01:02:52.728,01:02:54.730,Good.
01:02:54.730,01:02:56.189,"Thank you, Vinz."
01:02:56.189,01:03:00.318,We have to find Ray.
01:03:04.030,01:03:06.032,"Bad news, honey."
01:03:06.032,01:03:08.118,I gotta go to work.
01:03:08.118,01:03:11.455,"Hey, will you stay here in bed until I get back?"
01:03:20.964,01:03:23.759,"WINSTON: Hey, Ray, do you believe in God?"
01:03:23.759,01:03:25.218,RAY: Never met him.
01:03:25.218,01:03:26.844,"Yeah, well, I do."
01:03:26.844,01:03:29.556,"And I love Jesus' style, you know."
01:03:29.556,01:03:33.769,This roofcap is made of a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
01:03:33.769,01:03:35.687,What are you so involved with there?
01:03:35.687,01:03:42.402,"These are the blueprints for the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building, and they're very, very strange."
01:03:42.402,01:03:43.945,"Hey, Ray..."
01:03:43.945,01:03:50.868,"do you remember something in the Bible about the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave?"
01:03:50.868,01:03:53.622,I remember Revelations 7:12.
01:03:53.622,01:03:56.916,And I looked as he opened the sixth seal.
01:03:56.916,01:03:58.460,"And, behold, there was a great earthquake."
01:03:58.460,01:04:01.379,And the sun became as black as sackcloth.
01:04:01.379,01:04:02.880,And the moon became as blood.
01:04:02.880,01:04:06.426,"And the seas boiled, and the skies fell."
01:04:07.719,01:04:08.928,Judgment Day.
01:04:08.928,01:04:10.555,Judgment Day.
01:04:10.555,01:04:14.225,Every ancient religion has its own myth about the end of the world.
01:04:14.225,01:04:15.560,Myth?
01:04:15.560,01:04:23.777,"Ray, has it ever occurred to you that maybe the reason we've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from the grave?"
01:04:27.989,01:04:30.200,How about a little music.
01:04:31.618,01:04:33.244,Yeah.
01:05:12.033,01:05:14.118,This way.
01:05:21.918,01:05:23.754,Excuse me.
01:05:23.754,01:05:25.088,Excuse me!
01:05:25.088,01:05:26.964,Just where do you think you're going?
01:05:26.964,01:05:30.009,"Step aside, miss, or I'll have you arrested for interfering with a police officer."
01:05:30.009,01:05:31.636,"Oh, no. Hold on."
01:05:31.636,01:05:35.014,I know you can't come in here without a warrant or a writ or something.
01:05:35.014,01:05:44.315,"Cease and desist all commerce order, seizure of premises and chattels, ban on the use of public utilities for non-licensed waste-handlers, and a federal entry and inspection order."
01:05:44.315,01:05:47.694,"Vinz, there's one more test I'd like to perform, if-- JANINE: Egon!"
01:05:47.694,01:05:49.696,I tried to stop them.
01:05:49.696,01:05:51.448,He says they have a warrant.
01:05:51.448,01:05:53.116,"Excuse me, this is private property."
01:05:53.116,01:05:54.785,Shut this off.
01:05:54.785,01:05:57.995,"I'm warning you, turning off these machines would be extremely hazardous."
01:05:57.995,01:05:59.372,I'll tell you what's hazardous.
01:05:59.372,01:06:03.042,You're facing federal prosecution for at least a half a dozen environmental violations.
01:06:03.042,01:06:05.962,"Now, either you shut off these beams or we shut them off for you."
01:06:10.467,01:06:11.927,Try to understand.
01:06:11.927,01:06:13.261,This is a high-voltage laser-containment system.
01:06:13.261,01:06:16.264,Simply turning it off would be like dropping a bomb in the city.
01:06:16.264,01:06:18.475,Don't patronize me.
01:06:16.264,01:06:20.017,"I'm not grotesquely stupid, like the people you bilk."
01:06:20.017,01:06:21.895,"At ease, officer."
01:06:21.895,01:06:25.690,"I think there's just been a slight misunderstanding, and I want to cooperate any way that I can."
01:06:25.690,01:06:26.900,"Forget it, Venkman."
01:06:26.900,01:06:30.570,"You had your chance to cooperate, but you thought it'd be more fun to insult me."
01:06:30.570,01:06:32.155,"Well, now it is my turn, wiseass."
01:06:32.155,01:06:34.365,"He wants to shut down the protection grid, Peter."
01:06:34.365,01:06:37.577,"You shut that thing down, we won't be held responsible for whatever happens."
01:06:37.577,01:06:39.329,You'll be held responsible.
01:06:39.329,01:06:40.831,Shut it off.
01:06:40.831,01:06:42.248,VENKMAN: Don't shut it off.
01:06:42.248,01:06:44.167,I'm warning you.
01:06:44.167,01:06:46.586,"Um, I... I've never seen anything like this before."
01:06:46.586,01:06:49.506,"I don't know-- Yeah, I'm not interested in your opinion."
01:06:49.506,01:06:51.132,Just shut it off.
01:06:52.258,01:06:55.011,"My friend, don't be a jerk."
01:06:55.011,01:06:56.304,Step aside.
01:06:56.304,01:06:57.806,"If he does that again, you can shoot him."
01:06:57.806,01:06:59.056,"You do your job, pencil-neck."
01:06:59.056,01:07:00.558,Don't tell me how to do mine.
01:07:00.558,01:07:01.810,"Thank you, officer."
01:07:01.810,01:07:03.311,Shut it off!
01:07:25.000,01:07:27.210,"Oh, shit..."
01:07:42.141,01:07:44.310,EGON: Clear the building!
01:08:14.090,01:08:16.968,This is it! This is the sign.
01:08:16.968,01:08:21.138,"Yeah, it's a sign, all right."
01:08:30.648,01:08:32.067,"Hey, look up there."
01:08:32.067,01:08:34.611,What's going on? What happened?
01:08:34.611,01:08:36.947,The storage facility blew.
01:08:36.947,01:08:38.031,"Oh, great."
01:08:38.031,01:08:39.490,"That's bad, isn't it?"
01:08:39.490,01:08:40.617,Yeah.
01:08:40.617,01:08:42.118,Where's the Keymaster?
01:08:42.118,01:08:44.370,Who's the Keymaster?
01:08:45.496,01:08:48.458,Hold it! I want this man arrested.
01:08:48.458,01:08:52.003,"Captain, these men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act."
01:08:52.003,01:08:54.338,And this explosion is a direct result of it.
01:08:54.338,01:08:55.966,"Your mother-- Come on, hold it."
01:08:55.966,01:08:57.383,Hold it. Hold it.
01:09:41.678,01:09:44.097,"Columbia Building, 57th Street."
01:09:44.097,01:09:47.934,"I'm in a hurry, so let's not dawdle."
01:10:41.821,01:10:44.157,"Hey, guard."
01:10:44.157,01:10:46.576,"Look, I want to make a phone call."
01:10:46.576,01:10:48.870,I just work with these guys.
01:10:48.870,01:10:56.002,EGON: The structure of this roofcap is exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space.
01:10:56.002,01:11:01.966,Cold-riveted girders with cores of pure selenium.
01:11:01.966,01:11:04.552,Everybody getting this so far?
01:11:04.552,01:11:05.845,So what?
01:11:05.845,01:11:08.890,"I guess they just don't make 'em like they used to, huh?"
01:11:08.890,01:11:11.475,No. Nobody ever made them like this.
01:11:11.475,01:11:15.939,"I mean, the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko."
01:11:15.939,01:11:27.742,"Ray, for a moment, pretend that I don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering, or physics, and just tell me what the hell is going on."
01:11:27.742,01:11:30.703,You never studied.
01:11:30.703,01:11:40.671,The whole building is a huge super-conductive antenna that was designed and built expressly for the purpose of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence.
01:11:40.671,01:11:46.510,Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of Spook Central.
01:11:46.510,01:11:49.889,She's not my girlfriend.
01:11:49.889,01:11:54.102,I find her interesting because she's a client and because she sleeps above her covers.
01:11:54.102,01:11:56.104,Four feet above her covers.
01:11:56.104,01:11:58.731,"She barks, she drools, she claws."
01:11:58.731,01:12:00.524,"It's not the girl, Peter, it's the building."
01:12:00.524,01:12:04.904,"Something terrible is about to enter our world, and this building is obviously the door."
01:12:04.904,01:12:07.240,The architect's name was Ivo Shandor.
01:12:07.240,01:12:09.117,I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide.
01:12:09.117,01:12:11.161,He was also a doctor.
01:12:11.161,01:12:13.454,He performed a lot of unnecessary surgery.
01:12:13.454,01:12:17.250,"And then, in 1920, he started a secret society."
01:12:17.250,01:12:18.501,Let me guess.
01:12:18.501,01:12:20.086,Gozer worshipers.
01:12:20.086,01:12:21.378,Right.
01:12:21.378,01:12:22.964,No studying.
01:12:22.964,01:12:28.886,"After the First World War, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive."
01:12:30.930,01:12:32.849,And he wasn't alone.
01:12:32.849,01:12:35.351,He had close to a thousand followers when he died.
01:12:35.351,01:12:41.398,"They conducted rituals up on the roof, bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world."
01:12:41.398,01:12:44.735,And now it looks like it may actually happen.
01:12:51.617,01:12:53.036,We have to get out of here.
01:12:53.036,01:12:54.787,We've got to find a judge or something.
01:12:54.787,01:12:56.539,"Hey, wait a minute."
01:12:56.539,01:12:58.082,Hold it!
01:12:58.082,01:13:05.422,"Now, are we actually gonna go before a federal judge and say that some moldy Babylonian god is gonna drop in on Central Park West and start tearing up the city?"
01:13:05.422,01:13:06.799,"Sumerian, not Babylonian."
01:13:06.799,01:13:08.134,"Yeah, big difference."
01:13:08.134,01:13:11.470,"No offense, but I gotta get my own lawyer."
01:13:11.470,01:13:12.722,"Okay, Ghostbusters."
01:13:12.722,01:13:14.891,The mayor wants to see you guys.
01:13:14.891,01:13:16.309,The whole island's going crazy.
01:13:16.309,01:13:17.810,I gotta split.
01:13:17.810,01:13:19.854,The mayor wants to rap with me about some things.
01:13:42.835,01:13:45.255,I am the Keymaster.
01:13:45.255,01:13:47.298,I am the Gatekeeper.
01:14:31.175,01:14:32.385,Stay back.
01:14:32.385,01:14:34.011,Stay back.
01:14:34.011,01:14:37.514,Stay back.
01:14:41.394,01:14:44.439,"I've got a city blowing up, and you guys are not giving me any answers."
01:14:44.439,01:14:46.983,"All right, we're blocking the bridges, the roads..."
01:14:46.983,01:14:50.027,"The Ghostbusters are here, Mr. Mayor."
01:14:50.027,01:14:52.447,The Ghostbusters.
01:14:52.447,01:14:55.658,"Hey, and where's this Peck?"
01:14:55.658,01:14:59.329,"I am Walter Peck, sir, and I'm prepared to make a full report."
01:14:59.329,01:15:00.830,These men are consummate snowball artists.
01:15:00.830,01:15:03.874,They use sense and nerve gases to induce hallucinations.
01:15:03.874,01:15:12.008,"People think they're seeing ghosts, and they call these bozos, who conveniently show up to deal with the problem with a fake electronic light show."
01:15:12.008,01:15:16.512,Everything was fine with our system until the power grid was shut off by dickless here.
01:15:16.512,01:15:18.139,They caused an explosion.
01:15:18.139,01:15:20.016,Is this true?
01:15:20.016,01:15:22.143,"Yes, it's true."
01:15:22.143,01:15:24.937,This man has no dick.
01:15:24.937,01:15:26.105,"Get off, you..."
01:15:26.105,01:15:27.898,Hey...
01:15:27.898,01:15:29.650,"Come on, break it up."
01:15:29.650,01:15:31.486,All right. All right. All right.
01:15:31.486,01:15:33.321,MAYOR: This is City Hall.
01:15:33.321,01:15:35.031,"Now, what am I going to do here, John?"
01:15:35.031,01:15:36.240,What is this?
01:15:36.240,01:15:39.369,All I know is that was no light show we saw this morning.
01:15:39.369,01:15:42.746,I've seen every form of combustion known to man.
01:15:42.746,01:15:45.541,But this beats the hell out of me.
01:15:45.541,01:15:48.044,The walls in the 53rd Precinct were bleeding.
01:15:48.044,01:15:49.170,How do you explain that?
01:15:49.170,01:15:50.838,"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
01:15:50.838,01:15:52.715,"Oh, Your Eminence."
01:15:54.758,01:15:56.593,Ah...
01:15:57.845,01:15:59.305,"How are you, Lenny?"
01:15:59.305,01:16:01.598,"You're looking good, Mike."
01:16:01.598,01:16:03.184,We're in a real fix here.
01:16:03.184,01:16:05.144,What do you think I should do?
01:16:05.144,01:16:11.567,"Lenny, officially, the Church will not take any position on the religious implications of these, uh...phenomena."
01:16:11.567,01:16:15.863,"Personally, Lenny, I think it's a sign from God."
01:16:15.863,01:16:17.490,But don't quote me on that.
01:16:17.490,01:16:19.575,"VENKMAN: No, I think that's a smart move, Mike."
01:16:19.575,01:16:23.704,"Now, I'm not gonna call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying."
01:16:25.331,01:16:28.709,"I'm, uh, Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor."
01:16:28.709,01:16:31.921,I've only been with the company for a couple of weeks.
01:16:31.921,01:16:34.424,"But I gotta tell you, these things are real."
01:16:34.424,01:16:38.594,"Since I joined these men, I have seen shit that'll turn you white."
01:16:39.762,01:16:41.138,"Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker..."
01:16:41.138,01:16:42.932,My name is Peck.
01:16:42.932,01:16:47.311,Or you could accept the fact that this city is headed for a disaster of Biblical proportions.
01:16:47.311,01:16:48.645,"What do you mean, Biblical?"
01:16:48.645,01:16:52.233,"RAY: What he means is Old Testament, Mr. Mayor, real wrath-of-God type stuff."
01:16:52.233,01:16:54.360,Exactly.
01:16:52.233,01:16:56.446,Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies.
01:16:56.446,01:16:57.821,Rivers and seas boiling.
01:16:57.821,01:16:59.490,Forty years of darkness.
01:16:59.490,01:17:02.076,WINSTON: The dead rising from the grave.
01:17:02.076,01:17:05.413,Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria.
01:17:05.413,01:17:07.164,Enough.
01:17:09.417,01:17:11.001,But what if you're wrong?
01:17:11.001,01:17:12.462,"If I'm wrong, nothing happens."
01:17:12.462,01:17:14.755,"We go to jail, peacefully, quietly."
01:17:14.755,01:17:16.006,We'll enjoy it.
01:17:16.006,01:17:22.472,"But if I'm right, and we can stop this thing, Lenny..."
01:17:24.223,01:17:31.647,You will have saved the lives of millions of registered voters.
01:17:35.943,01:17:40.364,I don't believe you're seriously considering listening to these men.
01:17:46.662,01:17:49.582,Get him out of here.
01:17:49.582,01:17:51.708,Bye.
01:17:51.708,01:17:53.461,"I'll fix you, Venkman."
01:17:53.461,01:17:55.171,I'm gonna get you a nice fruit basket.
01:17:55.171,01:17:56.506,I'm gonna miss him.
01:17:56.506,01:17:57.923,All right. All right.
01:17:57.923,01:17:59.800,We got work to do.
01:17:59.800,01:18:02.011,"Now, what do you need from me?"
01:18:15.732,01:18:17.985,"Come on, let's run some red lights."
01:19:20.881,01:19:22.216,"Hello, New York."
01:19:29.223,01:19:31.100,"VENKMAN: Hey, everybody!"
01:19:31.100,01:19:32.351,Whoa. Dr. Ray Stantz.
01:19:32.351,01:19:33.728,Would you please?
01:19:33.728,01:19:35.271,The heart of the Ghostbusters.
01:19:35.271,01:19:36.522,Thank you.
01:19:36.522,01:19:38.441,They love you.
01:19:38.441,01:19:41.068,"I like that shirt, friend."
01:19:41.068,01:19:44.405,MAN: All right!
01:19:45.781,01:19:48.909,VENKMAN: Gotta run.
01:19:48.909,01:19:52.037,"Okay, whatever happens, let's be professionals."
01:20:23.527,01:20:27.323,We might have to put a little overtime in on this one.
01:21:21.460,01:21:23.379,WOMAN: There they are!
01:21:31.178,01:21:35.015,RAY: I was in no way prepared for that!
01:21:35.015,01:21:37.351,It's all right.
01:21:37.351,01:21:38.977,We're fine.
01:21:38.977,01:21:41.063,We can take it.
01:21:41.063,01:21:42.606,CROWD: Ghostbusters!
01:21:42.606,01:21:44.400,Ghostbusters!
01:21:44.400,01:21:47.152,Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
01:21:47.152,01:21:48.320,VENKMAN: Do you want to play rough?
01:21:48.320,01:21:50.406,Let's do it.
01:21:50.406,01:21:52.199,Hey!
01:22:15.556,01:22:17.099,VENKMAN: Where are we?
01:22:17.099,01:22:22.229,RAY: It looks like we're in the teens somewhere.
01:22:22.229,01:22:24.815,"Okay, well, when we get to 20, tell me."
01:22:24.815,01:22:27.443,I'm gonna throw up.
01:22:57.306,01:23:00.726,Twenty-two. Is this it?
01:23:00.726,01:23:02.812,VENKMAN: Yep.
01:23:09.109,01:23:11.654,Oh...
01:23:11.654,01:23:13.864,Art deco. Very nice.
01:23:13.864,01:23:15.449,Where is it?
01:23:15.449,01:23:18.076,It's at the end of the hall.
01:23:57.324,01:24:00.410,"Hey, where do these stairs go?"
01:24:02.329,01:24:04.832,They go up.
01:24:09.294,01:24:12.840,"Okay, go ahead."
01:24:12.840,01:24:15.592,Watch it. Go ahead.
01:24:54.214,01:24:55.591,Dana.
01:24:57.342,01:24:59.428,ALL: Aah!
01:25:10.064,01:25:14.484,"Okay, so..."
01:25:53.356,01:25:55.025,It's a girl.
01:25:59.989,01:26:01.573,It's Gozer.
01:26:01.573,01:26:02.908,I thought Gozer was a man.
01:26:02.908,01:26:04.660,It's whatever it wants to be.
01:26:04.660,01:26:07.079,"Well, whatever it is, it's gotta get by us."
01:26:07.079,01:26:08.914,Right.
01:26:08.914,01:26:10.958,"Go get her, Ray."
01:26:22.886,01:26:24.763,Gozer the Gozerian?
01:26:27.683,01:26:28.934,Good evening.
01:26:28.934,01:26:42.238,"As a duly designated representative of the city, county, and state of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension."
01:26:42.238,01:26:44.867,That ought to do it.
01:26:45.784,01:26:48.495,Are you a god?
01:26:54.459,01:26:56.003,No.
01:26:56.003,01:26:57.921,Then...
01:26:57.921,01:26:59.381,Die!
01:27:23.530,01:27:24.907,Ray...
01:27:24.907,01:27:30.579,"when someone asks you if you're a god, you say yes!"
01:27:30.579,01:27:32.206,All right.
01:27:32.206,01:27:34.917,This chick is toast.
01:27:47.804,01:27:49.098,Got your stick...
01:27:49.098,01:27:50.682,ALL: Holding it.
01:27:52.434,01:27:54.310,Heat 'em up.
01:27:54.310,01:27:57.022,ALL: Smoking.
01:27:57.022,01:27:58.648,Make 'em hot.
01:27:58.648,01:27:59.900,ALL: Ready.
01:27:59.900,01:28:02.903,Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown.
01:28:04.947,01:28:07.199,Throw it.
01:28:14.873,01:28:17.209,"Nimble little minx, isn't she?"
01:28:17.209,01:28:18.501,We better go full-stream.
01:28:18.501,01:28:21.379,Aim for the flat top.
01:28:31.932,01:28:33.349,Wasn't so hard.
01:28:40.274,01:28:42.109,We neutronized it.
01:28:42.109,01:28:44.820,Do you know what that means?
01:28:44.820,01:28:46.404,And we had the tools.
01:28:46.404,01:28:48.115,We had the talent.
01:28:48.115,01:28:50.242,It's Miller time.
01:28:50.242,01:28:53.411,Ray...this looks extraordinarily bad.
01:28:53.411,01:28:54.579,"Oh, no."
01:28:54.579,01:28:56.123,WINSTON: What?
01:29:05.340,01:29:07.592,Look out!
01:29:29.239,01:29:32.450,GOZER: Sub-creatures.
01:29:32.450,01:29:41.543,"Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Volguus Zildrohar, the Traveler has come."
01:29:41.543,01:29:44.546,Choose and perish.
01:29:44.546,01:29:48.175,What do you mean choose?
01:29:48.175,01:29:49.843,Choose.
01:29:49.843,01:29:53.555,Choose the form of the Destructor.
01:29:53.555,01:29:56.058,"Oh, I get it."
01:29:56.058,01:29:58.434,"Oh, ho, ho."
01:29:58.434,01:30:00.478,Whatever we think of.
01:30:00.478,01:30:03.773,"If we think of J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us."
01:30:03.773,01:30:05.317,Okay?
01:30:05.317,01:30:06.818,Empty your heads.
01:30:06.818,01:30:08.737,We've only got one shot at this.
01:30:08.737,01:30:10.404,GOZER: The choice is made.
01:30:10.404,01:30:12.324,"Whoa! Ho, ho-- Whoa."
01:30:12.324,01:30:14.701,The Traveler has come.
01:30:14.701,01:30:16.995,Nobody choosed anything.
01:30:16.995,01:30:18.163,Did you choose anything?
01:30:18.163,01:30:19.413,No.
01:30:19.413,01:30:20.582,My mind was totally blank.
01:30:20.582,01:30:22.458,I didn't choose anything.
01:30:32.468,01:30:34.554,I couldn't help it.
01:30:34.554,01:30:38.225,It just popped in there.
01:30:38.225,01:30:39.768,What?
01:30:39.768,01:30:41.895,What just popped in there?
01:30:41.895,01:30:43.897,I... I...
01:30:43.897,01:30:45.065,Look!
01:30:45.065,01:30:47.776,RAY: No. It can't be.
01:30:47.776,01:30:49.111,VENKMAN: What is it?
01:30:49.111,01:30:50.444,"What did you do, Ray?"
01:30:50.444,01:30:51.613,"Ah, shit."
01:31:02.207,01:31:05.294,It's the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
01:31:36.366,01:31:38.785,"Well, there's something you don't see every day."
01:31:38.785,01:31:41.163,I tried to think of the most harmless thing.
01:31:41.163,01:31:43.415,Something I loved from my childhood.
01:31:43.415,01:31:45.499,"Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us."
01:31:45.499,01:31:48.003,Mr. Stay Puft.
01:31:48.003,01:31:51.006,"Nice thinking, Ray."
01:31:51.006,01:31:55.218,We used to roast Stay Puft marshmallows by the fire at Camp Waconda.
01:31:57.346,01:31:59.931,"Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon."
01:31:59.931,01:32:01.183,What have you got left?
01:32:01.183,01:32:03.685,"EGON: Sorry, Venkman."
01:32:03.685,01:32:06.396,I'm terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought.
01:32:16.572,01:32:17.657,"Oh, no."
01:32:17.657,01:32:19.826,Mother pus-bucket...
01:32:24.331,01:32:26.958,Nobody steps on a church in my town.
01:32:26.958,01:32:30.170,One... two... three...
01:32:49.898,01:32:51.941,"Funny, us going out like this."
01:32:51.941,01:32:53.943,Killed by a 100-foot marshmallow man.
01:32:53.943,01:32:55.820,We've been going about this all wrong.
01:32:55.820,01:32:57.030,This Mr. Stay Puft is okay.
01:32:57.030,01:32:58.614,He's a sailor.
01:32:58.614,01:33:00.825,"We get this guy laid, we won't have any trouble."
01:33:05.121,01:33:06.956,I have a radical idea.
01:33:06.956,01:33:08.375,The door swings both ways.
01:33:08.375,01:33:11.294,We could reverse the particle flow through the gate.
01:33:11.294,01:33:13.171,RAY: How?
01:33:13.171,01:33:14.672,We'll cross the streams.
01:33:14.672,01:33:16.091,"Excuse me, Egon."
01:33:16.091,01:33:17.426,You said crossing the streams was bad.
01:33:17.426,01:33:19.802,Cross the streams...
01:33:19.802,01:33:21.221,You're gonna endanger us.
01:33:21.221,01:33:26.976,"You're gonna endanger our client, the nice lady who paid us in advance before she became a dog."
01:33:26.976,01:33:30.105,There's definitely a very slim chance we'll survive.
01:33:35.318,01:33:37.362,I love this plan.
01:33:37.362,01:33:38.821,I'm excited to be a part of it.
01:33:38.821,01:33:39.989,Let's do it.
01:33:39.989,01:33:43.617,This job is definitely not worth another five a year.
01:33:44.786,01:33:46.079,Whoa!
01:33:46.079,01:33:48.290,Hurry.
01:33:50.459,01:33:52.752,"See you on the other side, Ray."
01:33:54.921,01:33:57.006,"Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman."
01:34:05.432,01:34:08.143,"Let's turn 'em on, Spengler!"
01:34:12.147,01:34:13.398,Spengler!
01:35:13.333,01:35:14.917,Winston?
01:35:14.917,01:35:16.378,Ah...
01:35:16.378,01:35:17.629,Are you all right?
01:35:17.629,01:35:20.089,Yeah. Yeah.
01:35:23.468,01:35:24.718,Venkman?
01:35:24.718,01:35:26.095,Spengler?
01:35:26.095,01:35:27.347,Ahh.
01:35:27.347,01:35:28.722,RAY: Venkman?
01:35:28.722,01:35:29.891,Ack.
01:35:29.891,01:35:33.645,RAY: Spengler?
01:35:35.146,01:35:37.940,"Oh, Spengler."
01:35:37.940,01:35:40.610,EGON: I feel like the floor of a taxi cab.
01:35:40.610,01:35:41.861,RAY: Venky?
01:35:41.861,01:35:43.196,"VENKMAN: Yeah, I'm all right."
01:35:43.196,01:35:45.907,"RAY: Oh, thank God. Oh."
01:35:45.907,01:35:47.492,EGON: I'm all right.
01:35:47.492,01:35:48.951,RAY: You all right?
01:35:48.951,01:35:50.328,WINSTON: I'm all right.
01:35:50.328,01:35:51.745,RAY: Yeah. You okay?
01:35:51.745,01:35:53.081,Fine.
01:36:00.838,01:36:05.510,"RAY: Oh, smells like barbecued dog hair."
01:36:05.510,01:36:07.761,"Oh, Venkman."
01:36:07.761,01:36:09.472,"Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry."
01:36:09.472,01:36:11.266,I'm sorry.
01:36:11.266,01:36:13.101,I just...
01:36:28.199,01:36:29.534,Look!
01:36:51.473,01:36:53.558,Oh...
01:36:55.268,01:36:59.063,"LOUIS: Somebody, turn on the lights!"
01:36:59.063,01:37:00.523,Help! Somebody?
01:37:00.523,01:37:02.442,Go check on that little guy.
01:37:07.947,01:37:09.240,What happened?
01:37:14.245,01:37:16.998,Oh.
01:37:16.998,01:37:23.171,"Oh. Oh, where am I?"
01:37:23.171,01:37:24.589,Oh.
01:37:24.589,01:37:25.799,Hi.
01:37:25.799,01:37:28.384,You'll be all right.
01:37:28.384,01:37:31.220,"Boy, the superintendent's gonna be pissed."
01:37:33.889,01:37:36.351,Are you okay?
01:37:36.351,01:37:38.561,Who are you guys?
01:37:38.561,01:37:40.146,We're the Ghostbusters.
01:37:43.107,01:37:44.317,Who does your taxes?
01:37:44.317,01:37:48.196,"RAY: You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual."
01:37:48.196,01:37:49.863,I know.
01:37:49.863,01:37:54.661,You have been a participant in the biggest inter-dimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909.
01:37:54.661,01:37:56.120,It felt great.
01:37:56.120,01:37:58.080,We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue.
01:37:58.080,01:38:00.082,Okay.
01:38:02.876,01:38:05.129,I love this town!
01:38:48.757,01:38:51.676,JANINE: Egon!
01:38:58.808,01:39:01.770,What's going on?
01:39:01.770,01:39:03.937,Does anybody want to interview me?
01:39:03.937,01:39:06.733,I'm an eyewitness.
01:39:08.317,01:39:10.111,I wanna go with them in their car.
