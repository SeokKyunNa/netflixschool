00:00:43.669,00:00:45.671,How does that go? Let's see...
00:03:20.199,00:03:22.077,-Mr. Murray's suite. -I'm already dead.
00:03:26.665,00:03:28.709,"-Who is it? -Your producers, Mr. Murray."
00:03:28.792,00:03:31.962,"They're outside. They've heard your beautiful voice, sir."
00:03:35.215,00:03:38.301,But God is your biggest fan. Number one fan.
00:03:38.385,00:03:40.721,"Truly a huge fan, Mr. Murray."
00:03:41.680,00:03:44.224,"-You really think so? -Number one, sir. Number one."
00:03:46.267,00:03:48.145,Murray Christmas!
00:03:48.228,00:03:49.437,-Get it? -Yeah...
00:03:49.521,00:03:53.483,"-Wow, you look festive. -I would lose those antlers."
00:03:54.818,00:03:57.529,Has anyone shown up for this thing?
00:03:58.197,00:04:00.240,"-We're here. -Yeah, so that's one friend."
00:04:02.283,00:04:04.327,I wouldn't miss this nutty gig for the world.
00:04:07.372,00:04:09.750,"-Chop, chop. -There's no one moving in the whole city."
00:04:09.833,00:04:12.002,The airports are closed. The trains are closed.
00:04:12.086,00:04:15.255,The buses and bridges and tunnels are not working.
00:04:16.048,00:04:20.552,A couple of saloons have closed. The entire city of New York is shut down.
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.139,And you're expecting me to go downstairs and do a show?
00:04:24.347,00:04:28.309,-Anything that's fun is always hard. -That's right.
00:04:28.518,00:04:32.814,"Oh, it's a miracle. You two are going to shut up for a second."
00:04:37.778,00:04:39.238,-Is it Clooney? -Is it Clooney?
00:04:39.320,00:04:41.656,"-Is he on the phone? -Please, God, let it be Clooney."
00:04:44.492,00:04:48.371,"Now, you'd better tell me because I'm going to find out. I am working."
00:04:50.040,00:04:52.960,Don't ever do this again. Ever. You got it?
00:04:58.132,00:05:00.884,-My sister. -Family is important.
00:05:01.093,00:05:03.011,I need you to produce!
00:05:04.554,00:05:07.599,-How do we cancel this? -Okay. I understand why you're frustrated.
00:05:07.682,00:05:10.227,"I would be frustrated, too. Maybe we shouldn't do it."
00:05:10.310,00:05:12.729,"-Bev, should we cancel it? -Okay. You two, grow up."
00:05:12.813,00:05:15.398,The satellite is bought and paid for and non-refundable.
00:05:15.482,00:05:17.776,-So we can't cancel. -You've got to try to cancel.
00:05:17.859,00:05:20.445,"-We placed all the ads, man. -Which is so exciting!"
00:05:20.528,00:05:24.241,-The network has been pro-mo'ing this. -They are very jazzed about it.
00:05:24.324,00:05:27.786,And I don't want to tell you how personally on the hook you are for this.
00:05:27.869,00:05:29.746,"You do not want to get sued, Bill."
00:05:29.955,00:05:32.540,You don't want to be personally on the hook. That is scary.
00:05:32.624,00:05:34.126,So we've got some weather issues.
00:05:34.334,00:05:41.175,"Hold on, Bev. Bill might have a right. Maybe-- Bill has a contractual right to do the best fucking Christmas show that he can."
00:05:41.258,00:05:43.593,Let me guess. You're the bad cop.
00:05:43.677,00:05:45.846,"Yeah, I'm sorry. That was a little over the top."
00:05:45.929,00:05:47.055,Hey.
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.558,-Think of the troops. -Yeah.
00:05:50.642,00:05:55.730,Right? And the kids in hospitals. And pets outside.
00:05:55.939,00:05:57.232,I need my antlers!
00:05:57.316,00:05:59.026,You always forget them.
00:05:59.109,00:06:01.611,"-Jackpot! Here we go. -Thanks, Paul. Come on."
00:06:02.237,00:06:03.655,Here we go. Here we go.
00:06:05.032,00:06:06.283,"No, no, no, no. No elevator."
00:06:06.365,00:06:09.744,The little guys in uniforms who run these things couldn't make it in today.
00:06:09.828,00:06:13.207,"Yeah, we're walking. A little exercise is not going to kill you."
00:06:13.874,00:06:17.211,"-Come on. -Goodness me. Dimitri, hold onto these."
00:06:38.773,00:06:42.401,"Alright, stand down, Double D. He's just a Hollywood sleaze bag."
00:06:43.070,00:06:46.365,I don't even know how to express my shame in this moment.
00:06:46.447,00:06:52.704,The Murricane skulking down the back stairs like some 25-dollar-an-hour Twin Cities hooker.
00:06:52.913,00:06:58.043,"Go away. I told you. I don't want a manager, especially you."
00:06:58.252,00:07:00.545,Maybe not. But you definitely need one.
00:07:00.628,00:07:06.760,"Bill, Billy, this sad excuse for a Christmas special-- No harm intended..."
00:07:06.843,00:07:08.095,"Oh, none taken."
00:07:08.178,00:07:10.847,"Seems more like a Christ-mess, as in, what a mess!"
00:07:13.308,00:07:15.018,We have George Clooney.
00:07:15.852,00:07:17.562,I rest my case.
00:07:17.645,00:07:18.813,You saw Monuments Men?
00:07:19.022,00:07:21.816,-I was in it. -Number what? Seven on the call sheet?
00:07:21.900,00:07:23.735,-You were so good in that. -You were great.
00:07:23.818,00:07:24.861,You were very good.
00:07:25.070,00:07:27.864,"What I'm saying is we all love George, right?"
00:07:27.948,00:07:30.033,He and I are close. He's a citizen of the world.
00:07:30.117,00:07:32.327,But we need size. We need edge.
00:07:32.535,00:07:36.539,"If security had come in today, I would be calling them right now."
00:07:36.748,00:07:40.501,"Look, just sign with me today, okay? I know you're a big fish."
00:07:40.585,00:07:43.463,"But you're not going to snap my line, okay? I'm hanging on tight."
00:07:43.546,00:07:45.424,Here's our Murricane special.
00:07:45.506,00:07:50.053,Blimp shot down into Dallas Cowboys Stadium-- -Done it. -Retractable roof opens.
00:07:50.137,00:07:53.556,"-80,000 screaming fans. -Yeah."
00:07:53.640,00:07:55.516,What? You do it in post.
00:07:55.600,00:07:56.601,Camera zooms in.
00:07:56.684,00:08:01.022,"We see Miley Cyrus wearing a sexy red mini skirt, sitting on a white sleigh."
00:08:01.106,00:08:02.732,-You run in-- -Miley's in Tahoe.
00:08:03.900,00:08:08.488,I know Miley. And that may or may not be true.
00:08:08.696,00:08:10.865,"Okay, you just have to go away. I'm sorry."
00:08:10.949,00:08:15.162,Please just go as far away as your company will send you.
00:08:15.245,00:08:18.039,"Miss, could you check him, please? Thank you."
00:08:18.123,00:08:20.667,"I've heard that one. You better check yourself, Bill."
00:08:20.750,00:08:23.378,You better run like a thief from this car wreck.
00:08:24.129,00:08:25.713,Total disaster.
00:08:27.299,00:08:29.092,Total disaster.
00:08:30.760,00:08:31.761,Are you an actress?
00:08:40.979,00:08:44.983,"Bill Murray and his celebrity friends gather-- See, Bill? Easy peasy."
00:08:45.066,00:08:50.280,"We cut from you here live on stage, to your guests' pre-taped reaction shots."
00:08:50.364,00:08:53.116,"No one knows you aren't in the same room together. Boom, done."
00:08:53.200,00:08:55.827,-A Christmas miracle. -You've got to be kidding.
00:08:57.496,00:09:01.082,This is from last year's Golden Globes. That's not going to match.
00:09:01.291,00:09:04.378,"Yeah, match it... What does it have to match?"
00:09:04.461,00:09:06.880,"It's all just fantasy, right?"
00:09:06.963,00:09:10.467,"I mean, we're the weavers of dreams. We're the makers of merry."
00:09:10.550,00:09:13.845,"-This is all just an illusion. -Absolutely. It's all an illusion, Bill."
00:09:13.928,00:09:16.890,That's Brad Pitt and Angelina. They're in Africa.
00:09:16.973,00:09:18.433,And it's daytime in Africa.
00:09:18.517,00:09:21.769,They're not in New York at Bemelmans. They're in Africa.
00:09:21.853,00:09:23.522,Those are huts.
00:09:24.814,00:09:28.109,"Come on. Bill, calm down and trust us."
00:09:28.193,00:09:31.154,Were you nominated for an Emmy for producing the SAG awards?
00:09:33.490,00:09:36.576,So get up there and do the show. We go live in 90 seconds.
00:09:36.784,00:09:41.206,"Bill, I think it's a blessing that these people didn't show up."
00:09:41.289,00:09:44.292,"Because now it's your time, you know."
00:09:44.501,00:09:47.587,The universe gives us many gifts. It's whether or not we receive them.
00:09:47.670,00:09:50.757,-That's right. Receive the gift. -This job is always surprising me.
00:09:51.383,00:09:54.386,"-I'm so alone. -Okay, Bill..."
00:09:54.469,00:09:55.929,-You know-- -We're with you...
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.222,"You know, you and I..."
00:09:58.306,00:10:00.016,we're not in the same business.
00:10:05.230,00:10:06.773,"Okay, there he goes. He's going."
00:10:06.856,00:10:09.859,"Bill, I don't want to pressure you, but one minute until air."
00:10:09.943,00:10:12.695,Five cameras. I like our chances of someone getting it right.
00:10:12.779,00:10:16.032,"60 seconds! He's going up. Let's get ready. Are you ready, Paul?"
00:10:24.874,00:10:27.043,"Is there a microphone or do we imagine that, too?"
00:10:29.421,00:10:30.505,You're on stage.
00:10:38.846,00:10:40.474,You people are disgusting.
00:10:40.557,00:10:42.683,-You're looking great up there. -Crushing it.
00:10:45.604,00:10:47.855,Everyone set? We're live on TV in...
00:10:48.064,00:10:54.654,"eight, seven, six, five, four, three..."
00:10:54.737,00:10:56.490,"Make it great. Two... Go, Bill!"
00:11:15.925,00:11:18.637,"This is a nightmare. I can't do this. I'm sorry, Ivan."
00:11:21.515,00:11:26.186,"I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be laughing. I want to weep, okay?"
00:11:28.647,00:11:31.399,I am weeping. I am weeping.
00:11:31.483,00:11:34.735,I've never wept on a stage. This is a first.
00:11:34.819,00:11:37.030,I just can't do this. I'm sorry.
00:11:37.113,00:11:41.034,We've got to... I don't know. Show an old football game or something.
00:11:41.117,00:11:42.743,I just can't do this.
00:11:45.539,00:11:48.500,I've got to run. I've got to hide.
00:11:56.257,00:11:58.009,I should have quit right then and there.
00:11:58.092,00:12:00.470,I should have stopped right then and there.
00:12:03.181,00:12:05.684,"Any kind of medium, half-talented fool."
00:12:07.768,00:12:10.480,-Bill Murray! -Chris Rock!
00:12:10.564,00:12:13.358,Chris! Chris!
00:12:13.441,00:12:16.611,"Bill, what are you doing here in the biggest blizzard in the world, man?"
00:12:16.819,00:12:21.241,"-Don't leave. Don't leave. -I'm not-- Don't leave. Stay, Chris. Stay."
00:12:21.324,00:12:23.910,Go around. You can't go that way.
00:12:23.993,00:12:27.455,-Counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise. -Counter-clockwise!
00:12:27.539,00:12:28.956,The other way.
00:12:34.588,00:12:38.049,Counter-clockwise. Chris!
00:12:39.259,00:12:40.677,"What's up, man?"
00:12:40.759,00:12:42.220,How did you get uptown?
00:12:42.303,00:12:44.431,-Subway. -They shut down the subway.
00:12:44.514,00:12:47.726,"They are. They are. I had to walk on the rails, man."
00:12:48.393,00:12:51.938,"-Sit down with me, buddy. -I'm sitting down, man."
00:12:52.021,00:12:53.814,What's going on? What's all this stuff?
00:12:53.898,00:12:56.109,"Well, I'm supposed to be doing a live TV show."
00:12:56.192,00:12:57.736,-Okay. -Live Christmas special.
00:12:57.818,00:12:59.320,-Are you in it? -It just started.
00:12:59.404,00:13:01.822,"-I'm the only one. -Oh, man."
00:13:01.906,00:13:05.744,You're doing a live special in the middle of the biggest blizzard of the year.
00:13:05.826,00:13:08.288,"That is so you, Bill. That is so you."
00:13:08.496,00:13:09.914,-But now you're here. -Yeah.
00:13:09.997,00:13:11.832,-And it's us. -No!
00:13:11.916,00:13:13.585,-Yeah! -No!
00:13:13.792,00:13:17.756,"-Dust off the pipes a little bit. Sing a-- -I don't sing, Bill."
00:13:17.964,00:13:20.258,-You sing. You're a rapper. -I don't rap.
00:13:20.467,00:13:22.302,Do you know me?
00:13:22.385,00:13:23.637,Some...
00:13:24.554,00:13:26.598,"You can do it, Chris. You've got to help me."
00:13:26.805,00:13:28.933,You can be the guy that saved Christmas.
00:13:29.016,00:13:31.144,I don't want to-- I can save your Christmas.
00:13:31.227,00:13:34.314,But what about mine? I've got to get out of here. I've got stuff to do.
00:13:34.397,00:13:35.982,I've got to get home and build stuff.
00:13:36.065,00:13:38.192,I've got to build a Malibu Barbie Beach House.
00:13:38.401,00:13:40.654,-You can't leave. You're trapped here. -Bill.
00:13:40.737,00:13:42.280,-No way you get out of here. -Bill.
00:13:42.363,00:13:45.450,"Now, look. All you've got to do is come in, sing a couple of songs."
00:13:45.533,00:13:48.703,"Dance a little bit, you know. We'll put you in some cool clothes."
00:13:48.787,00:13:53.166,And I swear on my life I will get you on the first snowmobile in the morning.
00:13:53.374,00:13:54.917,"Bill, I barely know you, okay?"
00:13:55.001,00:13:56.711,-I just met you-- -This is our chance!
00:13:56.795,00:13:59.172,-Where's your boys? -Let's hang! We've got to hang!
00:13:59.255,00:14:04.051,Where's George Clooney? Matt Damon or John Goodman? Your boys!
00:14:04.135,00:14:05.345,Why am I here?
00:14:05.553,00:14:08.515,Maybe you should postpone this. Do it a little later.
00:14:08.598,00:14:10.308,Is there any way?
00:14:10.391,00:14:11.601,No.
00:14:11.685,00:14:12.851,"I've got to go, Bill."
00:14:12.935,00:14:18.399,There is no fucking way I am doing a live television special.
00:14:18.483,00:14:19.693,No way.
00:14:19.900,00:14:21.361,I think I'm hearing you.
00:14:22.445,00:14:24.155,"Look who's here, everybody!"
00:16:28.195,00:16:29.029,Together.
00:17:04.899,00:17:06.025,Chris?
00:17:07.067,00:17:08.194,Rocky?
00:17:08.277,00:17:09.737,Don't try to step off of this.
00:17:11.698,00:17:12.699,Where's Chris?
00:17:12.907,00:17:15.702,He's gone. And so are we.
00:17:15.785,00:17:19.121,"Oh, my God. It's out on the entire Eastern seaboard."
00:17:19.330,00:17:22.041,"Pack it up, kids. We're out of here."
00:17:22.249,00:17:25.461,Amazing. This is good news. Force majeure.
00:17:25.545,00:17:28.339,Your contract was voided. You know what this means?
00:17:28.422,00:17:30.967,You're off the hook. Insurance will cover all of this.
00:17:31.050,00:17:34.053,Yeah. It's been a living hell.
00:17:34.136,00:17:35.471,"See you on the next one, Bill."
00:17:44.313,00:17:50.695,"Well, thank you-- Thank you, everyone. Have a merry Christmas."
00:17:51.905,00:17:52.864,Okay.
00:18:00.663,00:18:02.122,-Bill. -Paul.
00:18:02.206,00:18:04.124,-Yeah? -Where are we going?
00:18:04.792,00:18:07.503,"-You haven't quit drinking yet, have you? -Should I?"
00:18:09.005,00:18:10.381,Good man.
00:18:20.892,00:18:23.519,Chris and I sounded pretty good there for a minute or two.
00:18:24.186,00:18:25.813,I was moved.
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.067,"Well, I thought it was beautiful."
00:18:29.149,00:18:30.276,"Ah, thank you."
00:18:30.359,00:18:34.072,"The heat's off in here, fellas. This will help keep you warm."
00:18:34.280,00:18:39.994,"Well, you, or this, is the nicest thing that's happened to me all day. To you..."
00:18:41.621,00:18:45.249,It's Christmas Eve. It's my favorite night of the year.
00:18:45.917,00:18:50.379,The power is out. The storm is raging outside.
00:18:50.463,00:18:52.465,We're in here all cozy.
00:18:53.674,00:18:54.717,For now.
00:18:55.384,00:18:56.594,For now.
00:18:57.386,00:19:01.891,"Have another sip. Warm up, hon. 'Cause, baby, it's cold outside."
00:19:03.267,00:19:04.727,Can't you stick around?
00:19:14.070,00:19:16.405,I'm not kidding. It's really cold out.
00:19:46.144,00:19:48.312,"Okay, you flip the records while I pour."
00:19:50.690,00:19:53.109,"Baby, it's really bad out there."
00:19:55.736,00:19:58.698,You couldn't get a cab if your life depended on it.
00:20:04.745,00:20:07.957,"This is so corny, but your eyes look like starlight right now."
00:20:17.508,00:20:19.218,"Duly noted, you have tried."
00:20:21.303,00:20:23.389,"Oh, baby, don't hold out on me, please."
00:20:29.854,00:20:32.356,"Here, look at these hands of yours. This is ridiculous."
00:20:32.439,00:20:33.900,"Here, put them right under here."
00:20:33.983,00:20:36.694,This is the second warmest spot on the human body.
00:20:36.903,00:20:38.154,This is an old native trick.
00:20:38.237,00:20:41.615,"This can keep your fingers from freezing, turning black and falling off."
00:20:41.824,00:20:44.118,I'd hate it if you could never wear gloves again.
00:20:44.202,00:20:46.579,I don't think I could forgive myself.
00:20:46.662,00:20:49.165,Here. Where's... Give me the other one.
00:20:59.008,00:21:00.801,"You get pneumonia and die, it'd be my fault."
00:21:03.387,00:21:05.556,You've just got to trust me on this.
00:21:18.736,00:21:23.490,Wow. You are so wasted on the hospitality industry.
00:21:26.619,00:21:29.205,"Oh, the chefs! I've got to go."
00:21:29.288,00:21:32.250,"-Oh, let me help. Paul, watch the piano. -Alright."
00:21:33.876,00:21:36.254,The refrigerators are down.
00:21:36.336,00:21:38.839,The chefs are freaking out.
00:21:41.008,00:21:42.676,"Hey, are you guys okay?"
00:21:44.220,00:21:45.679,She's dying.
00:21:48.641,00:21:50.059,I mean dying.
00:21:52.186,00:21:53.479,It's a disaster!
00:21:54.688,00:21:57.066,"It's not a disaster, it's a celebration!"
00:22:00.402,00:22:03.405,in the history of the Carlyle Hotel.
00:22:03.489,00:22:06.492,Your beautiful food will not die.
00:22:06.575,00:22:08.161,It will live forever.
00:22:10.871,00:22:13.582,"Now, quickly, form a human chain."
00:22:13.666,00:22:16.335,Pass all the food. Up to the bar.
00:22:17.837,00:22:20.756,"All women, grab lobsters and vegetables."
00:22:20.840,00:22:23.676,"Men, any meat that's hanging."
00:22:23.759,00:22:25.219,Someone get ice cream.
00:22:38.565,00:22:42.069,You look like you'd like to have your photograph taken with me.
00:22:42.736,00:22:43.737,What?
00:22:43.821,00:22:47.116,I notice that seems to really cheer people up a lot when they do that.
00:22:47.200,00:22:48.826,They get big smiles.
00:22:48.909,00:22:51.578,I don't think that's really going to do the trick right now.
00:22:52.246,00:22:56.042,I saw a cake. It looked a lot like a wedding cake.
00:22:56.125,00:22:57.543,A lot...
00:22:57.626,00:22:58.794,Is that yours?
00:22:59.461,00:23:01.339,It was supposed to be.
00:23:01.421,00:23:03.465,But now... no wedding.
00:23:04.133,00:23:08.762,Because none of our family or friends or guests could make it in.
00:23:08.846,00:23:10.723,So it's ruined.
00:23:12.141,00:23:13.893,"Well, you're preaching to the choir."
00:23:14.560,00:23:16.270,We had to cancel everything.
00:23:17.395,00:23:20.983,"Our dream Bahamas honeymoon, everything."
00:23:21.817,00:23:28.241,"And then we're trapped in here, so sad and angry and things just have gotten..."
00:23:30.284,00:23:34.663,"Elliot, my fiancé, and I just started fighting."
00:23:35.331,00:23:36.665,"Yeah, I bet."
00:23:37.875,00:23:41.712,So Elliot caused the blizzard. That bastard.
00:23:43.505,00:23:45.632,He ruined my TV special. Where is he?
00:23:46.300,00:23:47.968,I think he's in the bar.
00:23:48.052,00:23:49.845,"Well, he's a little smart."
00:23:49.929,00:23:51.138,Want to come in?
00:23:51.805,00:23:53.515,They're giving away lobster.
00:23:55.601,00:24:00.064,"You know, I have a theory about getting married."
00:24:00.147,00:24:04.651,"And when I fall in love, I have vowed to practice it."
00:24:05.319,00:24:06.820,Would you like to hear it?
00:24:08.072,00:24:09.447,Not really.
00:24:10.116,00:24:11.951,-Cool... -Thanks.
00:24:12.034,00:24:15.371,"Alright, well, if you get hungry or thirsty..."
00:24:21.752,00:24:24.297,"Oh, this is an improvement. This is much better."
00:24:24.504,00:24:26.382,"Much, much better."
00:24:27.049,00:24:28.801,"Something is missing, though."
00:24:29.467,00:24:32.930,We've got food. We've got booze. We've got attractive people.
00:24:34.223,00:24:36.976,"-We need music. Christmas music. -Oh, music."
00:24:37.184,00:24:39.061,We need someone to sing a Christmas carol.
00:24:39.145,00:24:42.106,"We need a volunteer and that person is going to be you, Dimitri."
00:24:42.315,00:24:44.150,"Come on, you Macedonian madman."
00:24:44.233,00:24:46.819,"No, Mr. Murray, please. No, no, no. I can't."
00:24:47.027,00:24:48.737,You've got to dig deep in your history.
00:24:48.821,00:24:53.909,"You've got to go deep, to your childhood, your infancy, if necessary, and just bring us a Christmas carol."
00:24:53.993,00:24:55.744,"A one, two..."
00:24:59.873,00:25:03.127,You're not a singer. And we don't have time to find out if you're a dancer.
00:25:03.210,00:25:05.879,"Let's try this fellow. Scooter, give us something."
00:25:05.963,00:25:07.505,I know you know something. Come on.
00:25:19.726,00:25:21.479,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much.
00:25:21.561,00:25:25.399,You guys... are both not working out right.
00:25:25.607,00:25:28.819,"Come on, my little brandy angel. You've got... Look at you."
00:25:28.902,00:25:30.570,I can... Something...
00:25:40.373,00:25:42.291,I could watch you sing that all night long.
00:25:42.375,00:25:44.960,"But no one knows the second verse, am I right? No one?"
00:25:47.087,00:25:49.131,Sorry. Okay...
00:25:49.215,00:25:51.884,I'm going to you guys. You're going to be my Hail Mary.
00:25:51.967,00:25:55.471,How about you fellas play something that nobody knows.
00:25:58.682,00:25:59.850,A pleasure. Key of D?
00:26:30.464,00:26:35.635,Can you get in here? Just hit it. Just you. Just... Just... Do it.
00:26:38.972,00:26:39.973,You're a natural.
00:28:44.097,00:28:47.226,"And you guys can cook, too. Wow, you're going to be a real catch."
00:28:52.690,00:28:53.940,You're Elliot.
00:28:54.149,00:28:57.403,-How'd you know that? -I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present.
00:28:57.486,00:28:58.696,I'm here to warn you.
00:28:58.904,00:29:00.780,"Sorry, sir, but I'm not in the mood."
00:29:00.864,00:29:01.907,For love.
00:29:02.115,00:29:07.705,"The question is, are you in the mood for a lifetime of regret and loneliness?"
00:29:07.913,00:29:09.081,Please go away.
00:29:09.289,00:29:13.043,I can't. I'm a ghost. I've got to keep haunting and haunting and haunting.
00:29:14.378,00:29:16.547,"There's a lovely girl in the lobby, crying."
00:29:16.630,00:29:18.674,And not over her dead wedding cake.
00:29:18.757,00:29:28.058,"-See you in a minute. -Wait-- Peaches, love's got an up button and a down button and you decide which one to push."
00:29:28.141,00:29:29.184,What?
00:29:29.268,00:29:30.936,You ever try a soiled kimono?
00:29:31.019,00:29:32.730,-No. I-- -Just drink it.
00:29:34.690,00:29:36.734,That's it. There you go.
00:29:37.484,00:29:38.527,And listen.
00:29:45.075,00:29:46.118,"Hey, Paul."
00:32:41.042,00:32:42.711,Does anyone want a piece of cake?
00:32:45.213,00:32:46.715,I think she means you.
00:33:03.565,00:33:05.692,"Okay, now tell me your theory of love."
00:33:06.985,00:33:09.154,"Well, it's really more of a philosophy."
00:33:10.029,00:33:11.072,Whatever.
00:33:13.199,00:33:17.120,Try to remember the specific moment...
00:33:19.247,00:33:24.544,the exact second when you knew that you were really in love.
00:33:26.045,00:33:28.632,Not a time or a date or a trip.
00:33:29.215,00:33:36.473,But the instant that you knew for sure you were in love.
00:33:41.269,00:33:42.312,And then what?
00:33:43.522,00:33:44.898,And then sing about it.
00:33:47.901,00:33:48.944,To each other.
00:33:52.614,00:33:54.032,But I'll probably listen.
00:37:03.180,00:37:04.597,Will you marry me?
00:37:04.681,00:37:05.724,Yes.
00:37:06.766,00:37:20.947,"By the power invested in me by the Writers Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild and the Directors Guild-- I'm also on the wait list to the Teamsters Union-- I now pronounce you two officially reengaged."
00:37:29.831,00:37:32.625,"It's 12:01. Merry Christmas, everybody."
00:37:32.709,00:37:33.752,Merry Christmas.
00:37:37.214,00:37:38.256,Merry Christmas.
00:37:39.174,00:37:42.761,We're going to have to make a Christmas decision.
00:37:42.844,00:37:46.973,"It's either Slovenia or Mexico, folks. It's your choice."
00:37:47.182,00:37:48.266,Here we go!
00:41:24.065,00:41:25.275,"Oh, dear..."
00:41:25.358,00:41:26.401,Oh.
00:42:11.029,00:42:12.364,George! You made it!
00:42:12.447,00:42:14.866,"Well, there was traffic, so I caught a sleigh."
00:42:15.574,00:42:17.160,And you brought Miley Cyrus.
00:42:17.243,00:42:18.870,-Of course. -It's her sleigh.
00:42:18.953,00:42:21.373,"Hey, save your money. Flying private, you know..."
00:42:21.456,00:42:23.791,"-It's the reindeers that'll get you. -Oh, yeah?"
00:42:23.875,00:42:25.377,Trust me.
00:42:35.678,00:42:38.973,-I thought I'd make a Martini or two. -This is the place to do it.
00:42:53.654,00:42:56.491,"-Hello, ladies. -Oh, my goodness. The girls are here."
00:42:56.574,00:42:59.494,"Hi, ladies. Are you interested in a Martini?"
00:43:30.275,00:43:31.734,Yeah!
00:43:41.953,00:43:45.540,These kids have got something to do. Let's go make ourselves scarce.
00:43:46.749,00:43:48.293,"Gosh, it's beautiful isn't it?"
00:43:48.376,00:43:51.463,Yeah. For a sound stage in Queens...
00:48:16.435,00:48:18.187,"Break it down for me will ya, Paul?"
00:48:20.064,00:48:22.567,"Now, holy-moly..."
00:48:23.275,00:48:25.986,Alibaba and the 40 Thieves...
00:48:26.195,00:48:28.364,What size shoe is that anyway?
00:48:28.447,00:48:30.241,"Is that a seven-and-a-half, eight?"
00:48:31.033,00:48:34.495,"Or is that an eight-and-a-half, nine? Could-- Yeah..."
00:48:34.579,00:48:35.954,You're...
00:48:36.038,00:48:39.333,You're awful fine but I don't think you're mine.
00:48:39.542,00:48:42.919,You know there's no place like home for the holidays and...
00:48:43.003,00:48:46.549,I think I'd like you to take me home or vice versa.
00:48:59.812,00:49:01.814,"You're driving me crazy, Mama."
00:49:27.882,00:49:30.843,I am the king of Christmas.
00:49:47.485,00:49:51.447,Oh! Oh! Knock it off! Knock it off!
00:49:51.530,00:49:53.825,Come on! I can't breathe!
00:50:59.557,00:51:02.142,"Look out, old Santa is back."
00:51:07.899,00:51:08.941,Thank you.
00:51:21.829,00:51:23.497,Is it Christmas?
00:51:28.377,00:51:29.420,That's good.
00:51:35.051,00:51:36.677,"Thank you, Dimitri."
00:51:39.304,00:51:40.347,Not too bad.
00:52:10.294,00:52:12.922,"-Merry Christmas, Bill. -Merry Christmas, Paul."
00:52:13.129,00:52:16.592,"-Merry Christmas, Mr. Murray. -Merry Christmas, Dimitri."
00:52:25.517,00:52:27.603,"Merry Christmas, everyone."
00:54:00.487,00:54:01.613,Merry Christmas.
00:54:02.489,00:54:04.158,"Young lady, my ass."
