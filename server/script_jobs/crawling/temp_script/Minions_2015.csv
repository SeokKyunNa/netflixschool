00:01:25.709,00:01:28.333,Hey! Yo!
00:01:45.375,00:01:47.000,Minions.
00:01:47.041,00:01:51.959,Minions have been on this planet-- far longer than we have.
00:01:52.000,00:01:53.709,They go by many names.
00:01:53.750,00:02:01.083,"Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike-- Oh-- Oh, that one is Norbert."
00:02:01.125,00:02:03.000,He's an idiot.
00:02:03.041,00:02:09.500,"They're all different, but they all share the same goal: To serve the most despicable master they could find."
00:02:09.542,00:02:11.417,Ooh!
00:02:16.750,00:02:21.750,Making their master happy was the tribe's very reason for existence.
00:02:21.792,00:02:25.291,"Well, that's not to say that they didn't have other passions."
00:02:25.333,00:02:27.667,"Oh! Ha, hey!"
00:02:30.750,00:02:31.792,Banana!
00:02:31.834,00:02:34.000,Yum-yum! Huh?
00:02:34.041,00:02:36.041,Finding a boss was easy.
00:02:37.375,00:02:40.542,"But keeping a boss, therein lies the rub."
00:02:57.542,00:02:59.083,Oh!
00:03:06.875,00:03:08.875,Oh!
00:03:16.417,00:03:19.417,Aye. Oh.
00:03:20.291,00:03:21.959,Hmm. Oof!
00:03:22.000,00:03:25.041,Nope. It wasn't easy for these guys.
00:03:25.083,00:03:27.333,But they never gave up!
00:03:27.375,00:03:29.333,With the emergence of the Stone Age...
00:03:29.375,00:03:31.917,came the rise of a new species.
00:03:31.959,00:03:35.291,Man was very different from the dinosaur.
00:03:35.333,00:03:40.000,"He was shorter, hairier-- and way, way smarter."
00:03:45.542,00:03:50.458,The Minions took an instant liking to man-- - and helped him the best they could.
00:03:53.291,00:03:56.000,"Oh, no!"
00:03:58.291,00:03:59.500,Hmm?
00:03:59.542,00:04:01.208,"Oh, oh!"
00:04:07.875,00:04:09.417,Poor man.
00:04:09.458,00:04:11.792,So trusting. So fragile.
00:04:11.834,00:04:14.834,So-- So delicious.
00:04:14.875,00:04:17.959,Their quest for a boss put the Minions front and center...
00:04:18.000,00:04:21.041,for some of civilization's most historic moments.
00:04:23.333,00:04:25.458,Anubis!
00:04:26.834,00:04:29.208,Ancient Egypt held great promise.
00:04:30.834,00:04:32.500,Okay!
00:04:32.542,00:04:34.208,Pancake!
00:04:36.625,00:04:38.208,But it didn't last long.
00:04:38.250,00:04:40.250,Hmm. Oh.
00:04:40.291,00:04:42.625,Ow!
00:04:43.625,00:04:46.291,The Dark Ages were actually fun times.
00:04:47.917,00:04:51.208,Their new master had a tendency to party all night...
00:04:51.250,00:04:52.959,and sleep all day.
00:04:54.208,00:04:55.709,Ooh!
00:05:07.875,00:05:10.041,Oh.
00:05:10.083,00:05:12.417,"But eventually, the party was over."
00:05:15.917,00:05:21.333,They bounced from one evil boss to another-- but they never seemed to find their perfect fit.
00:05:24.709,00:05:28.792,"One particular employer took their failure very, very badly."
00:05:37.375,00:05:38.917,Huh?
00:05:40.166,00:05:43.667,The Minions had no other choice but to keep moving.
00:05:47.041,00:05:54.333,"Oh-- And then, when all hope seemed lost, they found sanctuary."
00:05:55.208,00:05:57.166,The Minions were safe!
00:06:13.542,00:06:14.667,Eh.
00:06:14.709,00:06:16.250,Ah!
00:06:25.208,00:06:29.375,Years passed as the Minions forged their own civilization.
00:06:29.417,00:06:32.375,They truly made a life for themselves.
00:06:32.417,00:06:35.291,But something just wasn't right.
00:06:41.041,00:06:42.834,They felt empty inside.
00:06:42.875,00:06:45.083,"Without a master, they had no purpose."
00:06:45.125,00:06:48.583,They became aimless and depressed.
00:06:53.417,00:06:58.542,"If this continued any longer, the Minions would perish."
00:06:59.959,00:07:05.041,"But all was not lost, for one Minion had a plan."
00:07:05.083,00:07:08.542,His name was Kevin.
00:07:10.000,00:07:13.834,He was excited to share his idea with the tribe.
00:07:13.875,00:07:18.542,"- He'd been preparing for days, weeks, months!"
00:07:18.583,00:07:21.000,But now he was ready.
00:07:32.375,00:07:33.959,Buddies!
00:07:43.709,00:07:48.458,"- Kevin would leave the cave-- go back to the outside world, and he would not return..."
00:07:48.500,00:07:51.625,"until he had found his tribe the biggest, baddest villain to serve."
00:07:53.041,00:07:55.000,But he needed help.
00:07:55.041,00:07:57.375,"Me! Me. Hey, hey!"
00:07:57.417,00:07:59.333,Bob was eager to go.
00:07:59.375,00:08:03.291,But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough for the dangerous journey ahead.
00:08:03.333,00:08:13.667,"Uh, no. Um-- Ooh!"
00:08:13.709,00:08:15.500,"Luckily, someone stepped up."
00:08:15.542,00:08:19.542,Stuart-- Huh? Me? Me?
00:08:19.583,00:08:22.625,"Truth be told, Stuart had no idea what he was chosen for-- Thank you! Thank you!"
00:08:22.667,00:08:25.500,Huh?
00:08:25.542,00:08:28.375,but was thrilled it made people cheer for him.
00:08:28.417,00:08:37.959,"Thank you-- Uh, Stuart, Stuart-- Me! Aah!"
00:08:41.375,00:08:43.500,See?
00:08:43.542,00:08:44.709,Ooh!
00:08:44.750,00:08:46.458,"Uh, okay?"
00:08:53.792,00:08:55.375,Yeah!
00:08:55.417,00:09:01.500,"Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm, but mostly lack of other volunteers, changed Kevin's mind."
00:09:03.291,00:09:05.083,Kumbaya!
00:09:05.125,00:09:06.792,Kumbaya!
00:09:08.333,00:09:10.333,The tribe said their farewells.
00:09:10.375,00:09:15.834,Kevin had given them something they hadn't had in a very long time-- Hope.
00:09:15.875,00:09:17.500,Bob!
00:09:17.542,00:09:19.834,"Hey, Tony."
00:09:19.875,00:09:27.792,"Tom-- Hey, Chris-- Ah. Sí, sí."
00:09:31.375,00:09:33.625,Bye-bye.
00:09:38.667,00:09:40.959,Kevin felt pride.
00:09:41.000,00:09:44.500,He was going to be the one to save his tribe.
00:09:44.542,00:09:47.667,"Stuart felt-- hungry, mostly."
00:09:47.709,00:09:50.291,He was going to be the one to eat this banana.
00:09:51.291,00:09:53.083,Oh.
00:09:51.291,00:09:58.625,And Bob-- Bob was frightened of the journey ahead.
00:10:00.208,00:10:02.875,Ah. Okay.
00:10:07.375,00:10:12.417,Uh-- Okay. Okay.
00:10:15.083,00:10:20.208,And they were off-- off to find their new boss!
00:10:40.333,00:10:43.125,Oh! Kevin!
00:11:00.375,00:11:02.000,Eh?
00:11:08.083,00:11:09.583,Banana?
00:11:11.166,00:11:15.166,"Uh, Stuart-- Banana."
00:11:15.208,00:11:16.834,-Banana!
00:11:16.875,00:11:25.542,"Stuart-- Uh, Bob?"
00:11:35.333,00:11:37.792,Huh?
00:11:37.834,00:11:39.542,"Hey, Bob!"
00:11:47.792,00:11:49.959,"Sí, sí."
00:11:59.417,00:12:01.000,"Uh, no, no."
00:12:04.917,00:12:06.458,"No, no, no."
00:12:09.250,00:12:18.917,Stuart-- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:12:18.959,00:12:21.333,"Oh, look at that one!"
00:12:21.375,00:12:23.959,Huh-- Oh! Look at that one!
00:12:24.000,00:12:25.917,Peace!
00:12:25.959,00:12:28.458,-Peace on Earth!
00:12:28.500,00:12:31.000,"Hey, hey, hey. Oh."
00:12:31.041,00:12:33.333,Boo-ya!
00:12:34.458,00:12:36.000,"Oh, oh, oh."
00:12:36.041,00:12:37.625,Wow.

00:12:41.250,00:12:43.041,"Hey, taxi!"
00:12:43.083,00:12:44.291,Oh.

00:12:57.792,00:12:59.458,Stuart?

00:13:28.125,00:13:31.500,Women's bell-bottoms and tie-dye shirts are marked down.
00:13:31.542,00:13:33.875,"-Eh, whoa!"

00:14:30.291,00:14:32.208,"Mmm, thank you."
00:14:32.250,00:14:33.875,Hmm?
00:14:39.875,00:14:43.041,"Boing, boing!"
00:14:49.542,00:14:51.125,"Sí, sí."
00:14:54.750,00:14:57.083,"Uh, nah."
00:14:57.125,00:14:58.667,"Okay, okay."
00:14:58.709,00:15:00.583,Eh?

00:15:07.875,00:15:09.750,"Well, Jennifer-- Hi."
00:15:09.792,00:15:14.000,Have you decided which of these three gentlemen you'll go on a date with?
00:15:14.041,00:15:15.667,Is it Bob?
00:15:16.458,00:15:18.000,"Yeah! Go, Bob!"
00:15:18.041,00:15:20.542,- Kevin?
00:15:20.583,00:15:23.000,Or will it be Stuart?
00:15:23.041,00:15:25.166,"Oh. Yo, Stuart."
00:15:25.208,00:15:26.834,"Gosh, this is so hard."
00:15:26.875,00:15:28.500,They all sounded so cute.
00:15:28.542,00:15:45.500,"Um, I think I'm going to go with-- Huh?"
00:15:45.542,00:15:49.000,You're watching the top-secret Villain Network Channel.
00:15:49.041,00:15:52.834,"If you tell anyone, we'll find you."
00:15:54.166,00:16:00.333,"Sponsored by Villain-Con-- for 89 years straight, the biggest gathering of criminals anywhere."

00:16:32.125,00:16:35.041,Crime isn't pretty.

00:23:59.709,00:24:04.250,"But by the time she was 13, she built a criminal empire!"
00:24:04.291,00:24:08.041,"If I was a Minion, that's who I'd want to work for!"

00:28:34.709,00:28:36.625,But we have one thing in common.
00:28:36.667,00:28:40.125,We were born with flippers!
00:28:41.291,00:28:44.333,No? Just me?

00:29:23.125,00:29:24.375,Whoa!
00:29:24.417,00:29:26.458,"Although, let's not kid ourselves."
00:29:26.500,00:29:31.333,"Truly, the only men for this job are Kevin and his Minions!"
00:29:31.375,00:29:34.166,Ten times the evil in half the package!

00:29:56.875,00:29:59.250,You see this tiny little trinket?
00:29:59.291,00:30:01.917,"-Well, just take it from my hand and you've got the job."
00:30:01.959,00:30:04.542,No big deal.
00:30:04.583,00:30:06.709,"Uh-- Oh, come on!"

00:31:15.500,00:31:17.125,Oh!
00:31:17.166,00:31:20.000,Didn't my speech inspire anyone...
00:31:20.041,00:31:23.333,to rise up and prove themselves worthy?
00:31:23.375,00:31:27.166,All these villains and yet I still have the... bear?
00:31:27.208,00:31:30.041,Stuffed bear!

00:34:31.375,00:34:34.417,How'd it go?
00:34:34.458,00:34:36.500,So evil!
00:34:36.542,00:34:39.000,A little bird dropped this off today.
00:34:40.041,00:34:42.458,I missed you. H.
00:34:42.500,00:34:45.166,It's me.
00:34:45.208,00:34:48.166,"Also, there was no bird."
00:34:48.208,00:34:54.458,"Herb, seriously, I wanna dig up that William Shakespeare so he can see what true writing is."
00:34:54.500,00:34:56.000,I love it.
00:34:56.041,00:35:01.667,"Ah, that works out because I love-- Well, I love-- too."

00:35:09.458,00:35:12.000,"Meet my husband, Herb."
00:35:12.041,00:35:16.542,"Inventor, super genius, fox."
00:35:16.583,00:35:21.959,"Herb, these are the new recruits-- Kevin, Stuart, and that cute little one is Bob."
00:35:22.000,00:35:23.500,"Hey, Bello."
00:35:23.542,00:35:27.375,Right on!
00:35:23.542,00:35:29.875,"You guys are crazy, little and way yellow, and I dig that!"
00:35:29.917,00:35:31.834,Huh?
00:35:33.375,00:35:35.750,"-Sweet, man!"
00:35:35.792,00:35:37.125,"Ahh, ahh."
00:35:40.458,00:35:43.375,"I know, right?"
00:35:43.417,00:35:47.041,Just a few things I stole to help fill the void.
00:35:47.083,00:35:49.542,Whoa!
00:35:52.250,00:35:54.250,Checkin' out my can?
00:35:54.291,00:35:58.291,We stole that because finally someone expressed my love of soup in painting form.
00:35:58.333,00:35:59.917,Wow!
00:35:59.959,00:36:04.291,"Okay, listen up!"
00:36:04.333,00:36:06.291,Do you know who this is?
00:36:06.333,00:36:08.583,"Uh, la cucaracha?"
00:36:08.625,00:36:12.834,"This is Queen Elizabeth, ruler of England."
00:36:12.875,00:36:15.500,"Oh, I love England."
00:36:15.542,00:36:17.500,"The music, the fashion."
00:36:17.542,00:36:19.959,I'm seriously thinking about overthrowing it someday.
00:36:20.000,00:36:22.208,Ooh!
00:36:22.250,00:36:25.875,"Anyway, this pale drink of water oversees it all."
00:36:25.917,00:36:28.834,"I'm her biggest fan, love her work."
00:36:28.875,00:36:32.000,"And I really, really, really want her crown."
00:36:35.792,00:36:39.125,"Steal me the crown, and all your dreams come true."
00:36:39.166,00:36:41.625,Respect!
00:36:41.667,00:36:42.875,Banana!
00:36:43.542,00:36:45.083,Banana!
00:36:45.125,00:36:47.125,Whoo-hoo!
00:36:55.542,00:36:57.041,Henry!
00:37:30.667,00:37:32.166,Oh! Ahh!
00:37:32.208,00:37:33.875,Hmm?
00:37:35.333,00:37:37.125,Wow!
00:37:37.166,00:37:39.291,Ooh-la-la.
00:37:39.333,00:37:41.125,"No! Oh, no."
00:37:41.166,00:37:44.625,"Don't get too close, boys."
00:37:44.667,00:37:48.959,"But right now, it's leaking radiation like you would not believe."
00:37:50.667,00:37:54.041,"-So, you're here for gear."
00:37:55.542,00:37:57.333,Whoa!
00:37:57.375,00:38:01.208,-Bob. Robert.
00:38:01.250,00:38:04.542,You get my far-out stretch suit.
00:38:06.000,00:38:07.667,Wow!
00:38:07.709,00:38:10.500,Kevin. Kev-bo.
00:38:07.709,00:38:13.583,Seventh Kevin-- You are the proud owner of my lava lamp gun.
00:38:13.625,00:38:17.542,-Ah?
00:38:17.583,00:38:20.458,Ooh!
00:38:20.500,00:38:25.417,"And finally, Stu."
00:38:20.500,00:38:28.250,"Stu-art. Stu-perman. Beef Stu-- I got you the coolest invention, probably ever."
00:38:28.291,00:38:31.917,Hypno-hat!
00:38:38.291,00:38:40.834,You can use it to hypnotize anyone.
00:38:40.875,00:38:42.000,Anyone!
00:38:42.041,00:38:44.750,"Oh, you look so great."
00:38:44.792,00:38:48.709,I feel like a proud mama with three dashing evil sons.
00:38:48.750,00:38:54.500,"Uh, Scarlet-- Scarlet-- No, no."
00:38:54.542,00:38:56.250,It's getting late.
00:38:56.291,00:38:59.709,You've had a big day.
00:38:59.750,00:39:06.125,"Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing-- These cats are pumped!"
00:39:04.000,00:39:09.667,"Boing, boing, boing-- Well, maybe I'll settle them down with a bedtime story?"
00:39:12.041,00:39:16.375,"Boing, boing-- How does that sound, Bob?"
00:39:14.875,00:39:18.458,"Boing, boing-- Bob. Bob. Bob!"
00:39:16.417,00:39:20.291,"Boing, boing-- Oh!"
00:39:20.333,00:39:21.834,That is a groovy idea!
00:39:21.875,00:39:23.500,I'll go get some cookies and warm milk.
00:39:23.542,00:39:27.125,This is gonna be so fun!
00:39:29.041,00:39:33.458,"Oh, yes, I've got a really, really good bedtime porry."
00:39:33.500,00:39:38.125,"Once upon a time, there were three little pigs."
00:39:39.500,00:39:49.083,"One fateful day, the pigs encountered-- a big, bad wolf-- who had a wonderful surprise for them."
00:39:49.125,00:39:54.041,The wolf offered the three piggies and all their friends a job working for her.
00:39:54.083,00:39:57.792,Everyone would be so happy.
00:39:57.834,00:39:59.333,All the three little piggies had to do...
00:39:59.375,00:40:01.458,was just steal one little crown...
00:40:01.500,00:40:03.125,that the beautiful wolf had wanted...
00:40:03.166,00:40:10.959,"ever since she was a penniless, little street cub, unloved and abandoned."
00:40:11.000,00:40:16.709,"But that crown would mean she was a princess, and everybody loves a princess!"
00:40:16.750,00:40:19.083,So the wolf sent the piggies to get that crown.
00:40:21.333,00:40:23.875,But the little pigs weren't up to the challenge.
00:40:23.917,00:40:25.792,They failed their mission.
00:40:25.834,00:40:31.709,So the wolf huffed and puffed and she blew them off the face of the earth!
00:40:33.417,00:40:34.917,"Yo, po-po!"
00:40:38.542,00:40:40.083,The end.
00:40:43.875,00:40:47.375,"Good luck getting that crown tomorrow, little piggies."
00:40:48.542,00:40:51.333,I know you won't disappoint me.
00:40:51.375,00:40:53.834,Hmm.
00:41:06.709,00:41:09.166,Okay.
00:41:10.792,00:41:12.500,"Oh, which way is the loo, please?"
00:41:12.542,00:41:16.041,"Oh, thank you."
00:41:16.083,00:41:17.667,Bello.
00:41:17.709,00:41:19.417,"Uh, three, please."
00:41:19.458,00:41:22.583,You're not allowed in without an adult.
00:41:22.625,00:41:24.208,"Scram, hooligans!"
00:41:24.250,00:41:28.709,"Oh-- Uh, hmm."
00:41:32.250,00:41:43.542,"Eh-- Oh, la-- How many tickets, please?"
00:41:43.583,00:41:46.166,"Uh-- Three, please."
00:41:47.542,00:41:50.458,"Uno, please. Uno."
00:41:55.417,00:41:57.083,"Enjoy yourself, love."
00:41:57.125,00:41:58.792,Thank you!
00:42:00.417,00:42:03.500,It was nowhere near Hyde Park!
00:42:03.542,00:42:05.583,Bob's your uncle.
00:42:05.625,00:42:08.250,Ah.

00:42:25.375,00:42:27.375,What are you doing here?
00:42:29.166,00:42:32.709,This is a restricted area!
00:42:32.750,00:42:41.291,"Uh, no-- Stop that!"
00:42:44.333,00:42:46.208,Get back.

00:44:20.959,00:44:24.125,"You think it's funny to mock the elderly, do you?"

00:44:26.000,00:44:29.375,"I've been up here for decades, just waiting for someone..."

00:48:00.875,00:48:03.083,"Cor, blimey."
00:48:04.208,00:48:06.166,One of England's most famous myths...
00:48:06.208,00:48:08.000,has become a reality...
00:48:08.041,00:48:10.333,as a new king has been crowned.
00:48:10.375,00:48:16.041,"Bob, who appears to be a bald, jaundiced child, has pulled the famed sword right from its stone..."
00:48:16.083,00:48:19.041,"which, legend dictates, makes him the new king."
00:48:19.083,00:48:22.041,Tiny yellow traitor!
00:48:36.000,00:48:38.250,Ah-ha-ha!
00:48:38.291,00:48:40.000,England!

00:48:42.500,00:48:44.000,England.
00:48:44.041,00:48:46.208,England.
00:48:46.250,00:48:49.417,England.
00:48:55.709,00:49:03.083,Said she couldn't live Hey! Hey!

00:49:27.583,00:49:29.291,"Hey, Bob!"
00:49:29.333,00:49:31.375,Chicken tikka masala!
00:49:31.417,00:49:33.500,Ah!
00:49:37.250,00:49:39.125,"Hello, King Bob."
00:49:39.166,00:49:41.750,Welcome to Buckingham Palace.
00:49:41.792,00:49:43.667,Uh... no.
00:49:43.709,00:49:45.792,"Oh, what's the matter, Your Majesty?"
00:49:45.834,00:49:49.250,"Whatever's bothering you, we can make it right."
00:49:49.291,00:49:50.875,Oh.
00:49:52.667,00:49:55.333,Buddies! Buddies!
00:49:55.375,00:49:56.875,Buddies!

00:50:22.041,00:50:24.542,King Bob!
00:50:29.250,00:50:31.000,Bob.
00:50:31.041,00:50:32.542,Pfft!
00:50:43.583,00:51:03.542,So-- -King Bob!
00:51:03.583,00:51:05.542,King Bob!
00:51:09.792,00:51:11.333,Oh!
00:51:13.208,00:51:15.333,No! Wait!
00:51:16.917,00:51:19.333,Waah! Oof!
00:51:19.375,00:51:22.083,Whoo-hoo!
00:51:22.125,00:51:24.834,Ugh!
00:51:24.875,00:51:27.250,Yee-haw!
00:51:27.291,00:51:30.500,Yaaah! Yakitori!
00:51:37.709,00:51:40.208,Ah! Ha-ha.
00:51:44.291,00:51:46.667,"Yes, King Bob?"
00:51:46.709,00:51:48.458,Oh.
00:51:48.500,00:51:50.208,King Bob?
00:51:50.250,00:51:52.500,King Bob?
00:51:52.542,00:51:55.458,"Ah, Claire. Mmm, Tiffany."
00:52:04.667,00:52:06.542,Pull!
00:52:06.583,00:52:09.041,How dare you!
00:52:15.709,00:52:17.000,Scarlet!
00:52:17.041,00:52:20.834,"Don't you Scarlet me, you backstabbing little traitors!"
00:52:20.875,00:52:23.709,Using Herb's invention to steal my crown?
00:52:23.750,00:52:28.208,Uh-- I feel used.
00:52:28.250,00:52:30.959,You stole my dream.
00:52:31.000,00:52:34.166,I was going to conquer England someday.
00:52:34.208,00:52:38.542,"There was going to be a coronation, and I was going to be made queen."
00:52:38.583,00:52:40.750,Every moment was planned.
00:52:40.792,00:52:44.083,I'd wear a dress so sparkly it glowed.
00:52:44.125,00:52:51.375,"And everyone who ever doubted me would be watching, and they would be crying!"
00:52:51.417,00:52:54.959,I was going to be the picture of elegance and class!
00:52:55.000,00:52:57.834,And you pinheads screwed it up!
00:52:57.875,00:53:00.500,"No, no, no."
00:53:00.542,00:53:05.125,"No, no, no, King Bob."
00:53:05.166,00:53:07.125,Who invited the square?
00:53:07.166,00:53:10.750,And you definitely cannot just give the job to this woman!
00:53:10.792,00:53:12.333,There are laws.
00:53:12.375,00:53:15.208,What?
00:53:17.750,00:53:21.125,Scarlet Popapil!
00:53:21.166,00:53:25.625,"King Bob has officially changed the law, clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill..."
00:53:25.667,00:53:27.500,to be crowned queen of England.
00:53:27.542,00:53:30.750,She will be coronated at London's historic Westminster Abbey.
00:53:30.792,00:53:36.333,"If I wasn't so polite, I'd say this spells certain doom for the country, if not the world."
00:53:36.375,00:53:40.000,But I'm so very polite that I shall keep my mouth shut.
00:53:40.041,00:53:42.625,"But, seriously, we're all in big trouble."
00:53:42.667,00:53:45.333,Scarlet! Scarlet!
00:53:45.375,00:53:47.875,I don't have time to answer any questions.
00:53:47.917,00:53:52.834,I just want to thank the Minions for going above and beyond the call of duty.
00:53:52.875,00:54:03.041,"You are three tiny, golden, pill-shaped miracle workers, and you have stolen not just England, but my heart."
00:54:03.083,00:54:05.125,"Scarlet, over here."
00:54:07.208,00:54:08.709,Pardon me?
00:54:10.625,00:54:12.250,-Eh?
00:54:12.291,00:54:15.542,So many.
00:54:15.583,00:54:18.709,"Well, you'll all get what you deserve."
00:54:18.750,00:54:20.917,Serve!
00:54:44.875,00:54:48.417,Oh.
00:54:50.542,00:54:52.542,Go ahead. Go ahead.
00:54:53.709,00:55:06.250,"Uh-- I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I hate you."
00:55:06.291,00:55:11.917,I thought I could get over what you did-- but I feel so betrayed.
00:55:11.959,00:55:14.166,"I think-- Uh, yes, I think..."
00:55:14.208,00:55:16.166,we're gonna have to break up.
00:55:16.208,00:55:18.667,And it's not you.
00:55:18.709,00:55:22.417,"Oh, wait, hold on. It is you."
00:55:22.458,00:55:24.000,"N-No, no."
00:55:24.041,00:55:25.834,"So get comfortable, Minions."
00:55:25.875,00:55:28.333,"Get real, real comfortable..."
00:55:28.375,00:55:30.667,because this is where you're going to spend...
00:55:30.709,00:55:35.417,the rest of your worthless little lives.
00:55:37.375,00:55:40.417,All right.
00:55:40.458,00:55:42.208,Herb.
00:55:42.250,00:55:44.333,Who's this handsome Herb fellow?
00:55:44.375,00:55:46.834,"No, my name is... Blerb."
00:55:46.875,00:55:48.792,I'm a dungeon master.
00:55:48.834,00:55:51.208,"Prepare for torture, which I do."
00:55:52.875,00:55:55.333,All right. Are we comfy?
00:55:55.375,00:55:57.375,This is torture.
00:56:01.500,00:56:04.083,Oh.
00:56:04.125,00:56:07.291,Wow.
00:56:07.333,00:56:12.250,"Oh, welcome to Hang Town, population: you!"
00:56:14.041,00:56:15.959,Oh. Ah.
00:56:17.750,00:56:19.291,Whoo-hoo!
00:56:19.333,00:56:21.834,Cut it out!
00:56:21.875,00:56:23.917,No laughing in the dungeon.
00:56:23.959,00:56:29.500,"I wanna see tears, and I wanna hear screams or I'm gonna get-- Wait."
00:56:29.542,00:56:31.709,Ooh!
00:56:33.166,00:56:36.000,-Look at this! Aaah.
00:56:38.000,00:56:39.667,Whoo-hoo!
00:56:42.333,00:56:47.917,"Hello! Will the future king, Herb Overkill, please come upstairs to prepare for the coronation?"
00:56:47.959,00:56:50.625,"Well, I hope you learned your lesson for today."
00:56:50.667,00:56:52.834,"Sí, sí."
00:56:52.875,00:56:56.709,"And by the way, it was me, Herb, the whole time."
00:56:58.250,00:57:01.166,I don't even know anyone named Blerb.
00:57:03.041,00:57:04.542,Oh.
00:57:04.583,00:57:07.166,I am hours away...
00:57:07.208,00:57:10.250,from becoming the queen of England.
00:57:10.291,00:57:12.208,I know. It's a gas!
00:57:12.250,00:57:14.166,I will finally get my crown.
00:57:14.208,00:57:15.750,It's all I've ever wanted.
00:57:15.792,00:57:18.291,I'm going to be so happy.
00:57:19.709,00:57:22.041,"But let me ask you something, Fabrice."
00:57:22.083,00:57:25.625,Does that look like this to you?
00:57:27.542,00:57:29.333,Mrs. Overkill.
00:57:29.375,00:57:33.125,"The hair in that picture, it's just two wavy lines."
00:57:33.166,00:57:36.000,"Oh! So, what, now you're an art critic?"
00:57:36.041,00:57:39.000,I drew that when I was five years old!
00:57:39.041,00:57:40.542,Get out of my sight!
00:57:44.250,00:57:45.750,"Bye, Fabrice!"
00:57:45.792,00:57:48.834,I liked him.
00:57:48.875,00:57:50.834,"So, what do you think of the dress?"
00:57:50.875,00:57:52.959,"Oh, it's so beautiful."
00:57:53.000,00:57:54.875,So fashion-forward.
00:57:54.917,00:57:57.333,So Valentino.
00:57:57.375,00:57:59.875,Gave it a sweetheart neckline because of my sweetheart.
00:57:59.917,00:58:04.166,"The high collar and cinched waist reflect a simpler, more violent time."
00:58:04.208,00:58:07.834,The material is a blend of taffeta and high-density body armor.
00:58:07.875,00:58:10.500,Fully armed and loaded.
00:58:10.542,00:58:13.166,And that glow?
00:58:13.208,00:58:15.750,Nice.
00:58:15.792,00:58:18.750,Gotta look good for the public.
00:58:18.792,00:58:21.000,Do you mind?
00:58:21.041,00:58:24.041,"Little tighter, sweetie."
00:58:24.083,00:58:26.041,Come on. I can take it.
00:58:26.083,00:58:28.083,A little tighter.
00:58:28.125,00:58:30.000,Tighter.
00:58:30.041,00:58:32.375,Must have... tiny waist.
00:58:33.583,00:58:35.291,Seeing stars.
00:58:35.333,00:58:37.458,Losing feeling in my legs.
00:58:37.500,00:58:39.125,Perfect. Tight.
00:58:42.750,00:58:44.625,Huh?
00:58:44.667,00:58:46.667,Ah! Bob! Stuart!
00:58:46.709,00:58:48.208,Eh?
00:58:55.917,00:58:59.500,Oh! Bello.
00:58:59.542,00:59:01.667,"Poochie, poochie-coo!"
00:59:01.709,00:59:03.875,Ah? Ah.
00:59:05.333,00:59:07.583,Ah.
00:59:09.750,00:59:11.375,Huh?
00:59:21.375,00:59:24.375,"Eh, Kevin!"
00:59:30.875,00:59:33.458,"Porry, Scarlet."
00:59:34.208,00:59:36.208,Ah!
00:59:39.000,00:59:41.625,Oh.
00:59:41.667,00:59:45.291,Ah.
00:59:45.333,00:59:46.875,Scarlet.
01:00:03.375,01:00:05.125,"I love you, Scarlet!"
01:00:05.166,01:00:07.417,Queen wave.
01:00:07.458,01:00:08.959,Queen wave. Ah.
01:00:18.041,01:00:21.000,"I am so, so excited."
01:00:21.041,01:00:23.166,Everyone looks so nice!
01:00:23.208,01:00:26.417,"Oh, you are just adorable!"
01:00:28.041,01:00:29.542,"Oh, yes!"
01:00:29.583,01:00:32.041,And that music-- ugh!
01:00:32.083,01:00:35.333,Who is that organist?
01:00:35.375,01:00:38.000,She looks like an Edna.
01:00:38.041,01:00:40.333,You are very good!
01:00:43.083,01:00:46.166,"Thanks for doing this, padre. Big fan."
01:00:46.208,01:00:48.125,Come here!
01:00:48.166,01:00:50.125,Ooh!
01:00:50.166,01:00:53.208,Ah.
01:00:55.875,01:00:57.667,"Go, go, go!"
01:01:02.625,01:01:04.542,Oh. Ah.
01:01:09.667,01:01:11.166,Ouch. Ouch!
01:01:14.166,01:01:16.667,Poochie?
01:01:16.709,01:01:18.792,"Oh. Ciao, poochie."
01:01:31.625,01:01:33.917,Bob.
01:01:33.959,01:01:35.458,Stuart!
01:01:43.875,01:01:45.375,Ah. Ooh!
01:01:47.542,01:01:49.458,Okay.
01:01:52.208,01:01:53.750,Oh.
01:01:53.792,01:02:02.083,"Will you, to your power, 'cause law and justice-- Aaah! Aaah!"
01:02:02.125,01:02:03.625,Oh!
01:02:19.625,01:02:25.542,"...in mercy-- Oh, no, no."
01:02:26.750,01:02:40.000,"Do you, Scarlet Overkill-- Yeah!"
01:02:40.041,01:02:41.667,Huh? Huh?
01:02:41.709,01:02:43.375,No!
01:03:04.875,01:03:10.166,"I proclaim thee, Scarlet Overkill, the queen of England."
01:03:10.208,01:03:11.500,Huh?
01:03:13.583,01:03:16.208,-Kevin!
01:03:22.542,01:03:25.166,Scarlet! Scarlet.
01:03:25.208,01:03:27.333,Somebody help me!
01:03:28.917,01:03:31.667,"Come on, come on!"
01:03:31.709,01:03:33.333,"One, two!"
01:03:33.375,01:03:35.917,"One, two!"
01:03:36.834,01:03:39.041,Huh?
01:03:45.291,01:03:48.417,"-Scarlet, you're okay."
01:03:48.458,01:03:51.166,He tried to kill me!
01:03:51.208,01:03:53.000,No.
01:03:53.041,01:03:56.000,"Villains, this is no longer a coronation."
01:03:56.041,01:03:58.709,It is an execution!
01:03:58.750,01:04:01.291,Get them!
01:04:04.959,01:04:07.917,"Whoa, Nelly."
01:04:48.291,01:04:50.875,Aaah!
01:04:52.250,01:04:53.792,Go!
01:04:53.834,01:04:55.709,You're mine!
01:04:58.417,01:05:00.500,Yakitori!
01:05:08.709,01:05:11.166,-Oops.
01:05:13.542,01:05:16.041,"Oh. Hey, I got one!"
01:05:19.709,01:05:22.208,Ah!
01:05:40.875,01:05:43.125,Huh? Ah.
01:05:43.166,01:05:45.083,Ah. Poochie.
01:05:45.125,01:05:46.709,Huh? Huh?
01:05:56.709,01:05:58.667,Stuart. Bob.
01:06:01.208,01:06:03.208,"Oh, hey! Buddies!"
01:06:05.709,01:06:07.875,Mind the gap.
01:06:09.291,01:06:11.166,Mind the gap.
01:06:11.208,01:06:13.208,Mind the gap!
01:06:13.250,01:06:14.792,England! England!
01:06:14.834,01:06:16.458,Mind the gap.
01:06:16.500,01:06:18.375,Mind the gap!
01:06:29.333,01:06:31.458,"Oh, what about this one?"
01:06:31.500,01:06:34.417,Why did the queen go to the dentist?
01:06:34.458,01:06:37.291,To get her teeth crowned.
01:06:39.166,01:06:41.375,"Tell us another one, Lizzy!"
01:06:41.417,01:06:43.500,Uh-- Uh-- Bello!
01:06:43.542,01:06:45.375,"Oh, it's you."
01:06:45.417,01:06:48.458,"Everyone, this is one of the little fellows..."
01:06:48.500,01:06:50.917,who stole the monarchy from me.
01:06:50.959,01:06:53.333,And how's that working out for you?
01:06:53.375,01:06:55.583,Scarlet.
01:06:55.625,01:06:59.667,"-Oh, yes, yes. I saw what was going on on the telly."
01:06:59.709,01:07:02.709,What was meant to be the coronation of Scarlet Overkill...
01:07:02.750,01:07:05.875,has gone terribly wrong-- Move!
01:07:05.917,01:07:09.041,Kevin. Kevin.
01:07:09.083,01:07:11.000,I know you're out there.
01:07:11.041,01:07:15.291,You think you've gotten away.
01:07:15.333,01:07:17.959,-Bello.
01:07:18.000,01:07:20.333,Which one shall I kill first?
01:07:20.375,01:07:23.291,"Little Bob, Stuart?"
01:07:23.333,01:07:26.500,Bob! Stuart!
01:07:26.542,01:07:31.500,"I will do it, Kevin, if you are not back here by dawn."
01:07:31.542,01:07:33.542,"-Oh, my."
01:07:51.917,01:07:54.792,There he is.
01:08:03.041,01:08:04.917,Follow me!
01:08:06.208,01:08:08.542,Ah! Ha-ha! Ah.
01:08:09.542,01:08:12.208,Ha-ha-ha!
01:08:14.166,01:08:16.291,Oh.
01:08:17.667,01:08:20.000,Harder! It's just my head.
01:08:20.041,01:08:23.041,"-Oh, no!"
01:08:23.083,01:08:25.917,This way! Look at 'em!
01:08:36.417,01:08:41.917,-Uh-- Huh?
01:08:41.959,01:08:44.041,Ah!
01:08:44.083,01:08:46.542,Oh!
01:08:50.208,01:08:53.333,Oh!
01:08:53.375,01:08:55.834,-Huh?
01:08:55.875,01:09:01.959,"Activation in three, two, one."
01:09:30.208,01:09:31.709,Bello.
01:09:35.959,01:09:38.125,Huh? Buddies.
01:09:41.083,01:09:45.208,"This is it, boys."
01:09:45.250,01:09:46.959,"Oh, and I'm keeping the bear."
01:09:47.000,01:09:48.500,Tim!
01:09:48.542,01:09:50.709,You're not gonna need him where you're going.
01:09:50.750,01:09:52.250,Heaven.
01:09:57.458,01:10:03.333,Huh? Uh-- Uh! Huh? Ah!
01:10:07.709,01:10:10.417,Bye-bye.
01:10:10.458,01:10:13.750,"Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay."
01:10:39.542,01:10:42.125,Ha-ha-ha!
01:10:46.667,01:10:48.250,Huh?
01:10:48.291,01:10:49.834,"Oh, whoa!"
01:10:49.875,01:10:51.750,"Wait, what?"
01:10:51.792,01:10:54.542,How did he-- Hold my bear.
01:10:56.625,01:10:58.125,Huh?
01:11:18.750,01:11:20.792,Yippee!
01:11:20.834,01:11:22.500,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
01:11:22.542,01:11:25.458,"So, that's your plan?"
01:11:25.500,01:11:28.000,Make yourself a bigger target?
01:11:30.917,01:11:32.959,Scone?
01:11:33.000,01:11:35.375,Huh?
01:11:35.417,01:11:37.333,K-K-Kevin?
01:11:37.375,01:11:39.750,Kevin!
01:11:39.792,01:11:41.959,Kevin!
01:11:42.000,01:11:44.000,Yaaah!
01:11:44.041,01:11:46.625,-Whoa!
01:11:51.709,01:11:55.375,-Huh?
01:11:55.417,01:11:57.083,Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:18:40.166,01:18:45.291,"The nation-- nay, the world-- was celebrating Kevin, Stuart and Bob."
01:18:45.333,01:18:52.291,"The last few thousand years were rough, no question, but things were finally going their way."
01:18:52.333,01:18:56.417,Kevin had never been more proud.
01:18:56.458,01:18:58.333,But something was missing.
01:18:58.375,01:19:01.250,Ha-ha!

01:19:24.375,01:19:27.041,"Things look bleak, baby."
01:19:27.083,01:19:38.625,But now at least I have my crow-- Huh?
01:19:45.041,01:19:47.750,"Child, give me that back."
01:19:47.792,01:19:51.083,"No, I don't think so!"
01:19:51.125,01:19:54.417,You have no idea who you're messing with.
01:19:54.458,01:19:57.375,I am the greatest super villain of all time!
01:19:57.417,01:20:00.375,"Oh, were you?"

01:21:02.709,01:21:06.333,"He was cunning, he was evil, he was perfect."
01:21:06.375,01:21:10.000,He was... despicable.
