00:02:06.333,00:02:08.458,- Faster !
00:02:11.750,00:02:15.208,- Aah !
00:03:39.166,00:03:41.750,- Ohh !
00:07:09.792,00:07:13.250,- Mmm.
00:07:26.250,00:07:28.166,Mommy !
00:07:29.959,00:07:33.917,"Come, Rameses."
00:07:29.959,00:07:37.250,We will show Pharaoh your new baby brother-- - Moses.
00:08:17.667,00:08:20.291,"- Ha, ha !"
00:08:20.333,00:08:22.250,You run like mules.
00:08:26.625,00:08:31.792,"- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like your face carved on a wall ?"
00:08:31.834,00:08:34.750,How about now ?
00:08:36.208,00:08:39.750,You almost killed me !
00:08:39.792,00:08:42.083,"Oh, come on."
00:08:42.125,00:08:46.166,"- Oh, it's fun you want ?"
00:08:46.208,00:08:49.125,- Whoa !
00:08:52.208,00:08:55.125,Whoa ! Aah !
00:08:58.750,00:09:00.709,Ohh. Moses ?
00:09:00.750,00:09:03.959,Whoa !
00:09:07.291,00:09:11.083,Whoa !
00:09:19.333,00:09:22.291,"Come on, you."
00:09:22.333,00:09:25.375,"Come on, Moses. Admit it."
00:09:25.417,00:09:28.125,"Yes, but it's not much of a view."
00:09:28.166,00:09:32.542,Hyah ! Whoo !
00:09:32.583,00:09:35.875,- Hey !
00:09:35.917,00:09:39.291,"Second born, second place."
00:09:50.458,00:09:52.125,Whoa !
00:09:56.583,00:10:00.375,- Whoa !
00:10:17.834,00:10:20.792,Jump !
00:10:58.834,00:11:01.792,Whoo !
00:11:03.709,00:11:06.667,"we'll get in trouble for this, do you ?"
00:11:08.750,00:11:12.208,Why do the gods torment me...
00:11:12.250,00:11:17.750,"with such reckless, destructive, - blasphemous sons ?"
00:11:15.291,00:11:20.375,"- Father, hear what I-- Be still !"
00:11:21.917,00:11:27.333,"I seek to build an empire, and your only thought is to amuse yourselves..."
00:11:27.375,00:11:29.333,by tearing it down.
00:11:29.375,00:11:31.417,Have I taught you nothing ?
00:11:31.458,00:11:35.458,"You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your Majesty."
00:11:35.500,00:11:38.667,It's not your fault your sons learned nothing.
00:11:38.709,00:11:40.667,- They learned blasphemy.
00:11:40.709,00:11:43.917,"Father, the fault is mine."
00:11:43.959,00:11:47.041,"I goaded Rameses on, and so I am responsible."
00:11:47.083,00:11:49.667,Hmm.
00:11:49.709,00:11:52.750,"Do you know the meaning of that word, Rameses ?"
00:11:52.792,00:11:54.917,"I understand, Father."
00:11:54.959,00:11:58.917,And do you understand the task for which your birth has destined you ?
00:11:58.959,00:12:01.375,The ancient traditions.
00:12:01.417,00:12:07.000,"When I pass into the next world, then you will be the morning and evening star."
00:12:07.041,00:12:09.709,One damaged temple does not destroy centuries of tradition.
00:12:09.750,00:12:13.000,But one weak link can break the chain...
00:12:13.041,00:12:16.917,of a mighty dynasty !
00:12:25.166,00:12:27.542,You have my leave to go.
00:12:27.583,00:12:29.500,Father.
00:12:43.041,00:12:45.000,Father ?
00:12:45.041,00:12:49.041,You know it was really my fault.
00:12:49.083,00:12:51.542,Must you be so hard on him ?
00:12:51.583,00:12:55.333,"Moses, you will never have to carry a burden..."
00:12:55.375,00:12:58.625,like the crown I will pass to Rameses.
00:12:58.667,00:13:06.583,"He must not allow himself to be led astray, not even by you, my son."
00:13:08.458,00:13:12.166,All he cares about is-- is your approval.
00:13:12.208,00:13:15.333,I know he will live up to your expectations.
00:13:15.375,00:13:17.834,He only needs the opportunity.
00:13:17.875,00:13:20.667,Maybe. Maybe so.
00:13:22.542,00:13:25.542,Go now. I shall see you both tonight.
00:13:39.959,00:13:42.792,"- Well, that went well."
00:13:42.834,00:13:44.792,Could have been worse.
00:13:44.834,00:13:48.333,The weak link in the chain.
00:13:50.542,00:13:53.583,"Well, you are rather pathetic."
00:13:53.625,00:13:56.750,"Irresponsible, ignorant of the traditions."
00:13:56.792,00:13:59.709,He practically accused me of bringing down the dynasty.
00:13:59.750,00:14:02.417,"Yeah, I can see it now."
00:14:02.458,00:14:06.041,- You can laugh about it.
00:14:06.083,00:14:09.709,Statues cracking and toppling over. The Nile drying up.
00:14:09.750,00:14:14.625,"Single-handedly, you will manage to bring the greatest kingdom on Earth to ruin."
00:14:14.667,00:14:16.625,"Tell me this, Moses."
00:14:16.667,00:14:21.917,"Why is it that every time you start something, I'm the one who ends up in trouble ?"
00:14:21.959,00:14:24.875,"- Ah, man ! Oh."
00:14:24.917,00:14:29.041,"- Ah, it's Rameses."
00:14:29.083,00:14:32.875,- I think you owe us an apology.
00:14:32.917,00:14:35.834,- I am so upset !
00:14:35.875,00:14:38.375,- You'll pay for this.
00:14:38.417,00:14:41.667,- Hmm.
00:14:41.709,00:14:45.792,"- Oh, look at me."
00:14:45.834,00:14:48.458,"- You know what your problem is, Rameses ?"
00:14:48.500,00:14:52.375,- You care too much.
00:14:52.417,00:14:55.375,"Oh, in that case, I suppose you care a lot more than I do..."
00:14:55.417,00:14:59.500,"that we're late for the banquet, for example."
00:14:59.542,00:15:02.750,I'm done for.
00:15:02.792,00:15:06.291,- Father will kill me.
00:15:06.333,00:15:08.625,Nobody will even notice us coming in.
00:15:13.542,00:15:16.792,Nobody will even notice.
00:15:19.792,00:15:22.083,"Ah, the young princes."
00:15:22.125,00:15:25.166,"Rameses, you were just named prince regent."
00:15:25.208,00:15:29.542,You are now responsible for overseeing all the temples.
00:15:29.583,00:15:32.375,I suggest you get over there...
00:15:32.417,00:15:34.750,and thank your father.
00:15:34.792,00:15:39.917,"- Apparently, Moses, someone thought he..."
00:15:39.959,00:15:42.875,just needed the opportunity.
00:15:44.208,00:15:46.750,- My lord Pharaoh.
00:15:46.792,00:15:49.458,I propose that the high priests offer tribute...
00:15:49.500,00:15:51.458,to their new regent.
00:15:51.500,00:15:54.333,Hotep ! Huy !
00:15:54.375,00:15:56.250,- Huy.
00:15:56.291,00:15:58.375,- The Midian girl.
00:15:58.417,00:16:00.333,Go get her.
00:16:01.458,00:16:07.291,"By the power of Ra, we present for your delectation and delight..."
00:16:07.333,00:16:11.375,an exotic apparition stolen from a faraway land.
00:16:19.166,00:16:23.250,- We offer you this delicate desert flower.
00:16:30.000,00:16:32.792,Let us inspect this... desert flower.
00:16:34.500,00:16:37.125,- More like a desert cobra.
00:16:37.166,00:16:39.917,"a snake charmer, are you ?"
00:16:39.959,00:16:42.458,That's why I give her to you.
00:16:42.500,00:16:46.041,"- No, that's generous, but-- - I won't be given to anyone."
00:16:46.083,00:16:49.250,"Especially an arrogant, pampered palace brat !"
00:16:49.291,00:16:52.625,let her talk to you like that ?
00:16:52.667,00:16:55.583,You will show the proper respect for a prince of Egypt.
00:16:55.625,00:16:59.750,But I am showing you all the respect you deserve-- none !
00:16:59.792,00:17:03.166,- No. Wait !
00:17:03.208,00:17:05.667,- Be still.
00:17:05.709,00:17:07.667,- I demand you set me free !
00:17:07.709,00:17:10.583,- Let go !
00:17:10.625,00:17:13.083,Aah ! Ohh !
00:17:21.625,00:17:25.083,You there !
00:17:25.125,00:17:27.125,Have her dried off...
00:17:27.166,00:17:30.625,and sent to Prince Moses' chambers.
00:17:30.667,00:17:34.667,"If it pleases you, Father, my first act as regent..."
00:17:34.709,00:17:36.709,is to appoint Moses...
00:17:36.750,00:17:39.333,as royal chief...
00:17:39.375,00:17:41.458,architect.
00:18:08.000,00:18:13.583,Well-- Right.
00:18:28.792,00:18:31.625,Shh. Come on.
00:18:40.709,00:18:42.625,Guards.
00:18:48.125,00:18:50.208,Uh...
00:18:51.583,00:18:54.125,there's a-a man tied up in my room.
00:18:55.625,00:18:58.291,"- Well, look into it."
00:19:12.667,00:19:15.583,"Please, I need water."
00:19:15.625,00:19:18.834,- I have a long journey ahead of me.
00:19:18.875,00:19:21.166,Thank you.
00:19:22.959,00:19:24.875,Hut-hut.
00:19:36.125,00:19:40.709,"- Oh. Oh, I'm sorry."
00:19:36.125,00:19:46.792,"I'm so sorry. I-- - Oh, please forgive me. I-- I didn't expect to see... you..."
00:19:46.834,00:19:51.375,"here, of all places, at-at-at our door."
00:19:51.417,00:19:55.000,"- Mmm, at last !"
00:19:55.041,00:19:57.875,"Didn't I tell you, Aaron ?"
00:19:57.917,00:19:59.875,"Miriam, do you want us flogged ?"
00:19:59.917,00:20:01.875,I knew you cared about our freedom.
00:20:01.917,00:20:04.208,- Miriam !
00:20:04.250,00:20:08.166,"Because you're-- well, you're our brother."
00:20:08.208,00:20:10.125,- What ?
00:20:08.208,00:20:16.875,- Be-- - They never told you ?
00:20:19.542,00:20:21.667,But you're here.
00:20:21.709,00:20:24.542,"- Be careful, slave !"
00:20:24.583,00:20:27.709,"Um, she's-she's exhausted from the day's work."
00:20:27.750,00:20:29.709,"Uh, not that it was too much."
00:20:29.750,00:20:31.709,We-- We quite enjoyed it.
00:20:31.750,00:20:34.542,But-But she's confused and knows not to whom she speaks.
00:20:34.583,00:20:38.417,"I know to whom I speak, Aaron."
00:20:38.458,00:20:40.792,- You are not a prince of Egypt.
00:20:40.834,00:20:43.667,- What did you say ?
00:20:43.709,00:20:46.458,"C-Come, Miriam."
00:20:46.500,00:20:48.709,"No, Aaron. No !"
00:20:48.750,00:20:51.375,- That's enough.
00:20:51.417,00:20:53.750,- Stop it.
00:20:53.792,00:20:56.667,Now you go too far.
00:20:56.709,00:20:59.959,"No ! Please, uh, Your Highness."
00:21:00.000,00:21:02.917,She's ill. She's very ill.
00:21:02.959,00:21:05.333,"- Please, Miriam, let us go."
00:21:05.375,00:21:08.542,Our mother set you adrift in a basket to save your life !
00:21:08.583,00:21:10.875,Save my life ?
00:21:10.917,00:21:12.875,Ask the man that you call Father.
00:21:14.542,00:21:18.083,- How dare you ?
00:21:18.125,00:21:22.041,- Enough of this.
00:21:22.083,00:21:24.000,"- I said, enough !"
00:21:25.959,00:21:28.208,You will regret this night.
00:22:25.583,00:22:29.250,It's Moses.
00:26:50.333,00:26:53.291,The Hebrews grew too numerous.
00:26:54.417,00:26:56.875,They might have risen against us.
00:26:56.917,00:27:00.333,"Father, tell me you didn't do this."
00:27:00.375,00:27:10.917,"Moses, sometimes, for the greater good, sacrifices must be made."
00:27:18.041,00:27:19.959,Sacrifices ?
00:27:23.166,00:27:25.834,"Oh, my son."
00:27:25.875,00:27:29.166,They were only slaves.
00:27:47.333,00:27:50.208,Moses ?
00:27:50.250,00:27:53.041,Is this where you found me ?
00:27:53.083,00:27:56.458,"Moses, please try to understand."
00:27:59.834,00:28:08.083,"So-- So everything I thought, everything I am, is a lie."
00:28:08.125,00:28:10.083,No.
00:28:10.125,00:28:13.583,"You are our son, and we love you."
00:28:15.417,00:28:17.875,Why did you choose me ?
00:28:17.917,00:28:20.959,"We didn't, Moses."
00:28:21.000,00:28:22.917,The gods did.
00:29:15.500,00:29:19.250,"Last night, the gods granted me a vision."
00:29:19.291,00:29:27.000,"I'm not merely going to restore this temple, I will make it more grand, more splendid than any other one in Egypt."
00:29:47.250,00:29:49.417,Aah.
00:29:49.458,00:29:51.417,- Get up !
00:29:58.709,00:30:01.208,Moses ! Look.
00:30:01.250,00:30:05.417,Fate has turned our little misadventure into a great opportunity.
00:30:05.458,00:30:12.375,- Father will be so pleased-- Put your back into it !
00:30:12.417,00:30:15.375,Faster !
00:30:15.417,00:30:17.500,the beginning.
00:30:17.542,00:30:23.208,"A gateway will open to an entire new city of white limestone, more dazzling than the sun."
00:30:23.250,00:30:25.750,"- And here, a statue of Hapi."
00:30:25.792,00:30:27.667,"I said, hurry !"
00:30:27.709,00:30:30.458,- ...two great column halls.
00:30:30.500,00:30:32.625,- Somebody's got to stop this !
00:30:45.041,00:30:47.000,Stop it.
00:30:49.041,00:30:52.417,- Leave that man alone !
00:31:03.083,00:31:07.500,Out of my way.
00:31:07.542,00:31:09.375,Who did this ?
00:31:09.417,00:31:13.375,Up there.
00:31:26.375,00:31:27.667,Moses !
00:31:39.542,00:31:42.500,"Moses, what's going on ?"
00:31:50.709,00:31:53.417,Moses !
00:31:55.041,00:31:57.417,- Moses !
00:31:57.458,00:32:01.291,"- No, wait."
00:32:01.333,00:32:04.000,We can take care of that.
00:32:04.041,00:32:06.375,I will make it so it never happened.
00:32:06.417,00:32:08.959,Nothing you can say can change what I've done.
00:32:09.000,00:32:12.792,"I am Egypt, the morning and the evening star."
00:32:12.834,00:32:18.583,"If I say day is night, it will be written, and you will be what I say you are."
00:32:18.625,00:32:20.917,I say you are innocent.
00:32:20.959,00:32:24.500,What you say does not matter.
00:32:24.542,00:32:26.500,I can't stay here any longer.
00:32:26.542,00:32:28.500,- Moses !
00:32:28.542,00:32:32.500,All I've ever known to be true is a lie.
00:32:34.959,00:32:37.583,I'm not who you think I am.
00:32:37.625,00:32:40.333,What are you talking about ?
00:32:40.375,00:32:43.959,Go ask the man I once called Father.
00:32:46.875,00:32:49.875,Moses ?
00:32:50.959,00:32:52.792,Please.
00:33:00.166,00:33:02.709,"Good-bye, brother."

00:36:05.125,00:36:07.333,Leave us alone !
00:36:07.375,00:36:11.792,- Stop it !
00:36:11.834,00:36:14.000,My father's the high priest of Midian.
00:36:14.041,00:36:16.834,You're going to be in big trouble.
00:36:16.875,00:36:20.000,- Aah !
00:36:20.041,00:36:22.917,Aren't these your camels ?
00:36:24.041,00:36:26.875,- Hut-hut !
00:36:26.917,00:36:29.125,- Wait !
00:36:35.875,00:36:37.834,Whoa !
00:36:45.583,00:36:47.542,What are you girls doing ?
00:36:47.583,00:36:50.000,We're trying to get the funny man out of the well.
00:36:50.041,00:36:52.750,Trying to get the funny man out of the well.
00:36:52.792,00:36:55.542,"- Well, that's one I've never heard before."
00:36:55.583,00:36:59.041,"Oh, uh, don't worry down there !"
00:36:59.083,00:37:01.375,"Uh, we'll get you out."
00:37:05.542,00:37:07.500,You.
00:37:07.542,00:37:10.667,Huh ?
00:37:10.709,00:37:13.208,- Ohh !
00:37:15.750,00:37:17.917,Mm-hmm.
00:37:19.959,00:37:23.750,That's why Papa says she'll never get married.
00:37:27.917,00:37:31.750,You don't have to do this.
00:37:27.917,00:37:34.375,"Ladies, please, I'm really-- I'm really quite-- No, not there, please."
00:37:34.417,00:37:37.166,"That tickles. Ladies, you've cleaned every inch of me."
00:37:37.208,00:37:39.458,"- Whoa, I-- I was wrong."
00:37:39.500,00:37:43.166,Let me through. Let me through.
00:37:43.208,00:37:47.333,Ah ! You are most welcome.
00:37:47.375,00:37:49.875,You should not be a stranger in this land.
00:37:49.917,00:37:52.667,You have been sent as a blessing.
00:37:52.709,00:37:55.750,"-Tonight, you shall be my honored guest."
00:37:58.208,00:38:02.000,"My father, Jethro, High Priest of Midian."
00:38:10.959,00:38:13.834,Psst. Sit with me.
00:38:13.875,00:38:16.375,"Um, all right."
00:38:19.000,00:38:21.834,Psst. Not yet.
00:38:21.875,00:38:24.875,"- Oh, sorry."
00:38:24.917,00:38:28.834,let us give thanks for this bountiful food.
00:38:30.208,00:38:32.875,And let us also give thanks for the presence...
00:38:32.917,00:38:36.959,"of this brave, young man whom we honor here tonight."
00:38:37.000,00:38:41.250,"- Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't."
00:38:41.291,00:38:44.417,I've done nothing in my life worth honoring.
00:38:48.208,00:38:54.875,"First, you rescue Tzipporah from Egypt, - then you defend my younger daughters from brigands."
00:38:54.917,00:38:58.041,You think that is nothing ?
00:38:58.083,00:39:01.750,It seems you do not know what is worthy of honor.
00:39:39.667,00:39:50.959,la-la-la-la - Dance with me.
00:39:51.000,00:39:54.417,"No, I don't know how."
00:41:02.959,00:41:05.709,- Dance with me.
00:41:05.750,00:41:10.041,"- No, I-- No. No !"
00:42:19.333,00:42:21.250,Mmm.
00:42:23.083,00:42:25.250,I love you.
00:42:42.625,00:42:44.542,Ahh !
00:43:05.166,00:43:07.750,It's too early for this.
00:44:11.417,00:44:13.333,Moses.
00:44:15.000,00:44:17.000,Moses.
00:44:17.041,00:44:18.583,Moses.
00:44:21.709,00:44:23.625,Here I am.
00:44:25.208,00:44:33.500,"from your feet, for the place on which you stand is holy ground."
00:44:41.291,00:44:43.208,Who are you ?
00:44:50.291,00:44:52.250,I don't understand.
00:44:52.291,00:44:59.417,"I am the God of your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
00:45:02.291,00:45:06.417,"You were born of my mother, Yocheved. You are our brother."
00:45:08.750,00:45:11.917,What do You want with me ?
00:45:13.583,00:45:18.000,I have seen the oppression of My people in Egypt...
00:45:18.041,00:45:20.959,and have heard their cry.
00:45:21.000,00:45:24.333,Leave that man alone !
00:45:24.375,00:45:27.834,come down to deliver them out of slavery...
00:45:29.000,00:45:37.417,"and bring them to a good land, a land flowing with milk and honey."
00:45:40.000,00:45:46.333,"And so, unto Pharaoh, I shall send..."
00:45:46.375,00:45:48.291,you.
00:45:48.333,00:45:52.375,Me ? Wh-Who am I to lead these people ?
00:45:52.417,00:45:55.208,They'll never believe me.
00:45:55.250,00:45:57.709,I shall teach you what to say.
00:45:57.750,00:46:01.041,Let my people go !
00:46:01.083,00:46:03.375,But I was their enemy.
00:46:03.417,00:46:07.709,"I was the prince of Egypt, the son of the man who slaughtered their children."
00:46:07.750,00:46:10.458,You've-- You've chosen the wrong messenger.
00:46:10.500,00:46:13.166,H-How can I even speak to these people ?
00:46:13.208,00:46:15.834,Who made man's mouth ?
00:46:15.875,00:46:19.750,"Who made the deaf, the mute, the seeing or the blind ?"
00:46:19.792,00:46:22.709,Did not I ?
00:46:35.458,00:46:43.458,"Oh, Moses, I shall be with you when you go to the king of Egypt."
00:46:43.500,00:46:46.500,But Pharaoh will not listen.
00:46:50.333,00:46:53.375,So I will stretch out My hand...
00:46:53.417,00:46:55.875,and smite Egypt...
00:46:55.917,00:46:58.542,with all My wonders.
00:47:02.625,00:47:07.000,"Take the staff in your hand, Moses."
00:47:07.041,00:47:13.166,"With it, you shall do My wonders."
00:47:17.500,00:47:20.291,"I shall be with you, Moses."
00:47:20.333,00:47:24.291,- Moses.
00:48:47.792,00:48:52.709,"But, Moses, you are just one man."
00:48:56.083,00:49:02.709,"Tzipporah, please."
00:49:09.667,00:49:12.250,Look at your family.
00:49:15.125,00:49:18.000,They are free.
00:49:18.041,00:49:20.166,They have a future.
00:49:20.208,00:49:22.875,They have hopes and dreams...
00:49:22.917,00:49:26.041,and the promise of a life with dignity.
00:49:28.583,00:49:31.583,That is what I want for my people.
00:49:33.083,00:49:35.583,And that is why I must do the task...
00:49:35.625,00:49:38.875,that God has given me.
00:49:50.542,00:49:53.083,I'm coming with you.
00:51:21.583,00:51:23.458,Rameses.
00:51:23.500,00:51:26.625,Moses ?
00:51:34.000,00:51:36.542,- Rameses !
00:51:38.917,00:51:42.333,Look at you !
00:51:42.375,00:51:45.667,"Well, look at you."
00:51:47.291,00:51:50.750,"Oh, Rameses, it's so good to see you."
00:51:50.792,00:51:52.834,"Excuse me, Your Majesty."
00:51:52.875,00:51:57.875,We are compelled to remind you this man committed a serious crime against the gods.
00:51:57.917,00:52:00.500,"We are loathe to bring it up, mind you."
00:52:00.542,00:52:05.208,The law clearly states the punishment for such a crime-- - Death !
00:52:05.250,00:52:08.625,Be still.
00:52:09.834,00:52:12.667,I am the morning and the evening star.
00:52:12.709,00:52:14.709,Rameses.
00:52:14.750,00:52:17.000,- It shall be as I say.
00:52:17.041,00:52:21.583,I pardon forever all crimes of which he stands accused...
00:52:21.625,00:52:24.125,and will have it known that he is...
00:52:24.166,00:52:28.709,"our brother Moses, the prince of Egypt."
00:52:32.667,00:52:41.709,"Rameses, in my heart, you are my brother, but things cannot be as they were."
00:52:41.750,00:52:44.125,I see no reason why not.
00:52:45.792,00:52:50.542,"You know I am a Hebrew, and the God of the Hebrews came to me."
00:52:50.583,00:52:53.083,What ?
00:52:53.125,00:52:55.709,He commands that you let His people go.
00:52:59.834,00:53:02.375,Commands ?
00:53:07.291,00:53:10.917,Behold... the power of God.
00:53:25.417,00:53:28.959,"Well, uh, impressive."
00:53:29.000,00:53:31.709,Hmm.
00:53:31.750,00:53:35.834,"Very well, Moses."
00:53:35.875,00:53:38.542,Hotep. Huy.
00:53:38.583,00:53:41.917,Give this snake charmer our answer.

00:55:09.959,00:55:14.917,"- Oh, that's pretty."
00:55:46.208,00:55:49.083,- Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha !
00:56:41.083,00:56:43.333,- They love it.
00:57:00.583,00:57:03.750,I know you.
00:57:03.792,00:57:06.166,What's this really about ?
00:57:07.250,00:57:11.041,"Rameses, look."
00:57:11.083,00:57:13.000,What do you see ?
00:57:17.166,00:57:20.667,A greater Egypt than that of my father.
00:57:20.709,00:57:23.417,That is not what I see.
00:57:23.458,00:57:27.959,change what you see.
00:57:28.000,00:57:31.959,I have to maintain the ancient traditions.
00:57:32.000,00:57:35.083,I bear the weight of my father's crown.
00:57:35.125,00:57:38.083,Do you still not understand what Seti was ?
00:57:38.125,00:57:41.542,He was a great leader.
00:57:41.583,00:57:45.041,His hands bore the blood of thousands of children.
00:57:45.083,00:57:46.875,Hmph.
00:57:46.917,00:57:48.875,My people.
00:57:48.917,00:57:53.000,And I can no longer hide in the desert while they suffer...
00:57:53.041,00:57:55.333,at your hands.
00:57:58.375,00:58:01.041,So...
00:58:01.083,00:58:04.041,you have returned...
00:58:04.083,00:58:06.291,only to free them.
00:58:17.125,00:58:19.250,I'm sorry.
00:58:27.792,00:58:29.709,Yes.
00:58:31.208,00:58:34.208,I had hoped...
00:58:34.250,00:58:50.667,that-- I do not know this God.
00:58:51.917,00:58:54.166,Neither will I let your people go.
00:58:54.208,00:58:59.083,"Rameses, please, you must listen-- I will not be the weak link !"
00:59:07.083,00:59:09.625,Tell your people as of today...
00:59:09.667,00:59:14.750,"their workload has been doubled, thanks to your God."
00:59:16.291,00:59:19.250,Or is it thanks...
00:59:19.291,00:59:21.208,to you ?
00:59:26.250,00:59:28.750,It's Moses.
00:59:31.083,00:59:33.625,Moses ! Ohh.
00:59:33.667,00:59:39.208,"So, Moses, how does it feel when you get struck to the ground ?"
00:59:40.542,00:59:43.583,I didn't mean to cause you more pain.
00:59:43.625,00:59:46.583,I'm just trying to do as God told me.
00:59:46.625,00:59:50.250,God ? When did God start caring about any of us ?
00:59:50.291,00:59:54.583,"In fact, Moses, when did you start caring about slaves ?"
00:59:54.625,00:59:57.291,Was it when you found out that you were one of us ?
00:59:57.333,00:59:59.291,Don't listen to him.
00:59:59.333,01:00:02.375,"No, he's-- he's right."
01:00:02.417,01:00:06.458,I did not see because I did not wish to see.
01:00:06.500,01:00:09.458,"Oh, you didn't see because you didn't wish to see."
01:00:09.500,01:00:12.625,"Ah ! Well, that makes everything fine then, doesn't it ?"
01:00:12.667,01:00:14.625,- Aaron !
01:00:14.667,01:00:17.208,You shame yourself.
01:00:19.166,01:00:22.208,Miriam.
01:00:24.291,01:00:26.792,I'm so sorry.
01:00:35.458,01:00:40.250,"Moses, hear what I say."
01:00:40.291,01:00:42.709,I have been a slave...
01:00:42.750,01:00:49.250,"all my life, and God has never answered my prayers until now."
01:00:49.291,01:00:57.291,"God saved you from the river, He saved you in all your wanderings, and even now He saves you from the wrath of Pharaoh."
01:00:57.333,01:01:04.166,"God will not abandon you, so don't you abandon us."
01:01:37.083,01:01:39.417,Miriam.
01:01:39.458,01:01:41.375,M-Miriam.
01:01:55.166,01:01:58.000,The ball disappears.
01:02:01.458,01:02:03.291,Rameses !
01:02:04.667,01:02:07.417,Let my people go !
01:02:09.458,01:02:12.417,"Still gnawing away at that bone, are we ?"
01:02:12.458,01:02:14.250,Carry on.
01:02:14.291,01:02:16.291,You cannot keep ignoring us.
01:02:16.333,01:02:20.583,Enough ! I will hear no more of this Hebrew nonsense.
01:02:20.625,01:02:22.542,Bring him to me.
01:02:24.417,01:02:26.542,- Moses !
01:02:39.875,01:02:43.792,"in your hand, Moses."
01:03:12.458,01:03:14.417,Father.
01:03:14.458,01:03:16.208,- It's-- - Blood !
01:03:16.250,01:03:18.583,"Blood ! Oh, blood !"
01:03:29.500,01:03:33.500,Hotep ! Huy !
01:03:33.542,01:03:35.917,- Ah !
01:03:33.542,01:03:38.917,"- Rest assured, Your Majesty-- Uh, yes, we were going to demonstrate the superior might..."
01:03:38.959,01:03:40.917,of our gods.
01:03:40.959,01:03:47.166,Uh-- By the power of Ra !
01:04:02.875,01:04:05.834,"Abandon this futile mission, Moses."
01:04:05.875,01:04:09.291,I've indulged you long enough.
01:04:09.333,01:04:12.709,This must now be finished.
01:04:14.959,01:04:17.333,"No, Rameses."
01:04:17.375,01:04:19.542,It is only beginning.
01:04:19.583,01:04:22.750,"But, Moses, d-didn't you see what happened ?"
01:04:22.792,01:04:25.542,The priests did the same thing.
01:04:25.583,01:04:28.500,Pharaoh still has the power over our lives.
01:04:31.417,01:04:34.709,"Yes, Aaron, it's true."
01:04:36.291,01:04:41.709,"He can take away your food, your home, your freedom."
01:04:41.750,01:04:46.542,He can take away your sons and daughters.
01:04:46.583,01:04:51.750,"With one word, Pharaoh can take away your very lives."
01:04:53.792,01:04:59.667,But there is one thing he cannot take away from you: your faith.
01:05:02.208,01:05:06.917,"Believe, for we will see God's wonders."
01:05:31.375,01:05:32.959,- Hmm.
01:08:32.667,01:08:34.834,Rameses ?
01:08:37.000,01:08:39.125,Rameses ?
01:08:42.709,01:08:45.166,You want me to...
01:08:45.208,01:08:48.125,let your people go.
01:08:51.000,01:08:53.583,I hoped I would find you here.
01:08:53.625,01:08:55.917,- Get out !
01:08:57.750,01:09:02.250,"Rameses, we must bring this to an end."
01:09:07.500,01:09:11.208,"Rameses, please, talk to me."
01:09:11.250,01:09:13.792,We could always talk here.
01:09:23.208,01:09:25.125,This place.
01:09:26.875,01:09:28.792,So many memories.
01:09:32.041,01:09:34.667,I remember the time you...
01:09:34.709,01:09:38.250,switched the heads of the gods of the temple of Ra.
01:09:42.250,01:09:48.667,"If I recall correctly, you were there switching heads right along with me."
01:09:49.750,01:09:52.208,"No, it was you."
01:09:52.250,01:09:54.208,"Oh, yes, you did."
01:09:54.250,01:09:58.834,"You put the hippo on the crocodile, and the crocodile-- - On the falcon."
01:09:58.875,01:10:02.458,The priest thought it was a horrible omen and fasted for two months.
01:10:02.500,01:10:05.792,Father was furious. You were always getting me into trouble.
01:10:12.875,01:10:19.834,But then-- you were always there to...
01:10:19.875,01:10:23.417,get me out of trouble again.
01:10:23.458,01:10:25.375,Hmmph.
01:10:29.750,01:10:33.291,Why can't things be the way they were before ?
01:10:34.750,01:10:36.667,Father.
01:10:36.709,01:10:38.625,It's so dark.
01:10:39.917,01:10:42.291,I'm frightened.
01:10:43.375,01:10:45.166,Why is he here ?
01:10:48.875,01:10:51.792,Isn't that the man who did all this ?
01:10:53.917,01:10:56.250,Yes.
01:10:56.291,01:10:59.208,But one must wonder...
01:10:59.250,01:11:01.208,why.
01:11:01.250,01:11:06.417,Because no kingdom should be made on the backs of slaves.
01:11:06.458,01:11:10.792,"Rameses, your stubbornness is bringing this misery upon Egypt."
01:11:10.834,01:11:14.083,It would cease if only you would let the Hebrews go.
01:11:14.125,01:11:17.083,I will not be dictated to.
01:11:17.125,01:11:20.875,I am the morning and the evening star.
01:11:20.917,01:11:25.083,Something else is coming.
01:11:25.125,01:11:28.083,"Please, let go of your contempt for life..."
01:11:28.125,01:11:31.375,before it destroys everything you hold dear.
01:11:31.417,01:11:33.542,Think of your son !
01:11:33.583,01:11:35.542,I do.
01:11:35.583,01:11:38.750,You Hebrews have been nothing but trouble.
01:11:38.792,01:11:42.291,My father had the right idea about how to deal with your people.
01:11:42.333,01:11:46.375,- Rameses-- - And I think it's time I finished the job.
01:11:46.417,01:11:50.834,- Rameses !
01:11:50.875,01:11:53.959,such as never has been or ever will be again !
01:12:08.750,01:12:12.041,"Rameses, you bring this upon yourself."
01:12:21.834,01:12:26.875,"to me again, saying, Take a lamb..."
01:12:26.917,01:12:29.834,and with its blood...
01:12:29.875,01:12:39.083,"mark the lintel and posts of every door, for tonight..."
01:12:39.125,01:12:43.375,I shall pass through the land of Egypt...
01:12:43.417,01:12:46.542,and smite all the firstborn.
01:12:52.667,01:12:55.959,But when I see the blood upon your door...
01:12:57.750,01:13:05.542,"I will pass over you, and the plague shall not enter."
01:15:42.125,01:15:46.083,You and your people...
01:15:46.125,01:15:49.291,have my permission to go.
01:15:54.166,01:15:56.083,Leave me !
01:24:02.625,01:24:06.041,you shall do...
01:24:06.083,01:24:08.208,My wonders !
01:25:25.667,01:25:27.792,Leave it !
01:26:01.417,01:26:02.959,"Yeah, me too."
01:26:21.750,01:26:24.834,Eeee-yaaaaah !
01:26:40.917,01:26:44.667,Don't just stand there !
01:26:44.709,01:26:47.125,- Kill them all !
01:26:49.041,01:26:52.750,- The soldiers !
01:26:57.333,01:27:00.166,- Hurry ! Hurry ! I got you.
01:27:25.125,01:27:29.083,No !
01:28:59.709,01:29:01.625,Thank you.
01:29:29.125,01:29:33.041,Moses !
01:29:38.542,01:29:42.917,Moses !
01:29:46.083,01:29:47.917,"Good-bye, brother."
01:30:10.041,01:30:14.375,- Look.
01:30:18.250,01:30:20.166,They are free.
