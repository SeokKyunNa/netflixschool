00:18:55.500,00:18:57.166,My name is Nile.
00:18:57.250,00:18:59.250,I am an American Marine.
00:20:03.541,00:20:05.083,We will leave you in peace.
00:58:57.333,00:58:58.166,"Nicolo, wake up."
00:59:01.541,00:59:02.666,Wake up.
00:59:02.750,00:59:03.583,Wake up!
00:59:03.666,00:59:04.541,I'm here.
00:59:05.583,00:59:06.416,I'm here.
00:59:07.375,00:59:08.791,Wherever here is.
00:59:09.833,00:59:10.958,In an armored van.
00:59:12.000,00:59:12.875,They used gas.
01:15:31.666,01:15:32.958,We should go back there.
01:15:34.958,01:15:36.208,That would be nice.
00:00:42.791,00:00:46.875,"over and over again, and each time the same question."
00:00:50.750,00:00:52.541,Will this time be the one?
00:00:54.000,00:00:56.000,And each time the same answer.
00:00:58.458,00:01:00.291,And I'm just so tired of it.
00:02:16.375,00:02:17.333,You travel?
00:02:18.000,00:02:18.958,I did.
00:02:20.625,00:02:21.875,And I got you something.
00:02:21.958,00:02:22.958,What's that?
00:02:24.166,00:02:26.958,"-Ooh, first edition Don Quixote. -Mmm-hmm."
00:02:27.041,00:02:29.166,-That couldn't have been cheap. -It wasn't.
00:02:29.958,00:02:31.666,"So why am I here, Booker?"
00:02:38.208,00:02:39.250,He's freelance now.
00:02:39.333,00:02:42.083,He has a hostage situation in South Sudan.
00:02:42.791,00:02:45.333,"No, Booker. We don't do repeats. You know that."
00:02:45.416,00:02:46.375,It's too risky.
00:02:48.416,00:02:49.291,Andy.
00:02:53.416,00:02:54.375,Joe and Nicky?
00:02:55.291,00:02:56.250,At the hotel.
00:03:08.791,00:03:10.458,"Thank you. Welcome to El Fenn, sir."
00:03:32.208,00:03:34.125,Would you like me to take one for you?
00:04:10.416,00:04:12.333,-You look great. -You look okay.
00:04:19.000,00:04:21.375,And I have something for you.
00:04:21.458,00:04:22.541,Nicky!
00:04:28.333,00:04:29.666,"Five hundred, Booker."
00:04:42.166,00:04:43.500,Mmm!
00:04:46.291,00:04:47.666,"Hazelnut, not walnut."
00:04:49.375,00:04:50.333,The Black Sea.
00:04:52.041,00:04:53.083,Rosewater.
00:04:55.125,00:04:56.375,Pomegranate.
00:05:02.375,00:05:03.208,Eastern Turkey.
00:05:17.208,00:05:18.833,"Admit it, boss. You missed us."
00:05:21.416,00:05:22.250,I did.
00:05:25.083,00:05:26.208,"It's a job, guys."
00:05:27.625,00:05:28.958,We can do some good.
00:05:29.041,00:05:31.000,Have you been watching the news lately?
00:05:32.416,00:05:33.750,Some good means nothing.
00:05:37.375,00:05:38.875,"I don't know about this, guys."
00:05:39.375,00:05:40.458,We're not helping.
00:05:44.416,00:05:47.333,"I know you needed a break, but it's been over a year, boss."
00:05:47.875,00:05:49.333,"This is what we do, Andy."
00:05:58.666,00:05:59.708,I'll hear him out.
00:06:30.833,00:06:32.916,"Mr. Booker, bonjour."
00:06:33.625,00:06:42.625,"-It's a pleasure to finally meet you. -Last time I checked, Moved to London when I was three."
00:06:43.458,00:06:45.333,"So why did you leave the agency, Mr. Copley?"
00:06:47.250,00:06:48.375,My wife got sick.
00:06:49.458,00:06:50.291,ALS.
00:06:51.125,00:06:52.458,She died two years ago.
00:06:52.541,00:06:54.458,Just haven't found my way back yet.
00:06:54.541,00:06:56.083,-Sorry for your loss. -Thank you.
00:06:57.166,00:06:58.791,"You haven't aged a day, Booker."
00:07:02.791,00:07:07.375,"Yesterday afternoon local, a school southwest of Juba was attacked by a militia."
00:07:07.875,00:07:11.375,They murdered the teachers and abducted 17 of the students at gunpoint.
00:07:12.500,00:07:13.916,The youngest was eight...
00:07:15.041,00:07:16.041,"oldest, 13."
00:07:18.000,00:07:25.000,"South Sudanese asked the US for help, but current administration's policy is to deny aid to any nonstrategic allies."
00:07:26.291,00:07:28.916,Some of my ex-colleagues at the CIA feel differently.
00:07:30.208,00:07:32.541,"They reached out to me, and I'm reaching out to you."
00:07:34.250,00:07:36.791,The last overfly confirmed the personnel on site.
00:07:39.916,00:07:41.625,No food or water being brought in.
00:07:49.875,00:07:55.416,"And when they do, most likely they'll be separated, and odds are we'll never find them again."
00:07:56.500,00:07:57.791,Has to be done quickly...
00:07:58.208,00:08:01.041,"by the best, and your team's the best I've ever seen."
00:08:01.458,00:08:02.666,You can name your price.
00:08:10.625,00:08:12.291,We'll invoice you when it's done.
00:12:29.708,00:15:09.416,Motherfuck-- Very pissed off.
00:15:10.250,00:15:11.500,So where are the girls?
00:15:18.291,00:15:19.708,There never were any girls.
00:15:29.500,00:15:30.833,We've been set up.
00:15:56.333,00:15:57.208,Yeah.
00:16:16.625,00:16:19.416,One has to admire Mr. Copley's attention to detail.
00:16:20.541,00:16:23.833,Those shoes were a particularly grotesque touch.
00:16:23.916,00:16:25.375,I knew this was gonna happen.
00:16:25.875,00:16:27.166,I said it.
00:16:27.250,00:16:28.291,"We did it right, Andy."
00:16:28.375,00:16:31.250,"-For the right reasons. -And what did it get us, Nicky? What?"
00:16:33.458,00:16:34.291,Nothing.
00:16:35.083,00:16:36.500,We've done nothing.
00:16:37.166,00:16:39.166,The world isn't getting any better.
00:16:39.250,00:16:40.541,It's getting worse.
00:16:40.625,00:16:42.833,"I checked him completely, and..."
00:16:43.666,00:16:44.875,everything seemed legit.
00:16:47.125,00:16:48.291,"I'm sorry, guys."
00:16:48.708,00:16:51.166,They know who we are. They know what we are.
00:16:54.458,00:16:55.916,We have to find Copley.
00:16:59.041,00:17:00.500,We have to tie this thing off.
00:17:00.583,00:17:02.541,-And then what? -And then nothing.
00:17:06.916,00:17:08.875,The world can burn for all I care.
00:17:17.250,00:17:18.083,I'm done.
00:18:01.916,00:18:03.125,"Freeman, where you at?"
00:18:03.666,00:18:04.500,"Here, Sergeant."
00:18:09.291,00:18:11.708,The women are holed up in the house with the arches.
00:18:12.208,00:18:14.208,Take a right at the building with the red carpet.
00:18:14.291,00:18:16.375,-Get me some information. -Roger that.
00:18:31.833,00:18:33.208,Never hurts to repeat it.
00:19:06.125,00:19:10.208,He has killed many of our people and many of yours.
00:19:13.583,00:19:15.500,Have any of you seen him?
00:19:22.958,00:19:27.333,You do not disrespect your family by telling us where he is.
00:19:37.833,00:19:38.958,There are no men here.
00:19:39.500,00:19:41.833,To use women as shields is to be no man at all.
00:19:52.583,00:19:54.666,Thank you for allowing us into your home.
00:20:19.250,00:20:20.125,Breach!
00:20:37.125,00:20:40.541,"Lima 3, this is India 5. Contact, over."
00:20:41.000,00:20:42.291,"Jay, go check on the women."
00:20:42.375,00:20:43.333,On it.
00:20:46.000,00:20:48.333,"Not if he bleeds out. They wanted him alive, remember?"
00:20:49.583,00:20:50.625,Do not touch me.
00:20:51.041,00:20:52.625,"I'm trying to save you, man."
00:20:53.666,00:20:55.208,"Dizzy, a little help, please?"
00:20:58.083,00:20:59.458,No! Medic!
00:20:59.541,00:21:00.625,Man down!
00:21:02.458,00:21:04.500,No! Jesus! Medic!
00:21:08.291,00:21:09.416,Stay with me!
00:21:10.125,00:21:11.000,"Oh, my..."
00:21:11.916,00:21:13.583,"God! Jesus, no."
00:21:13.666,00:21:15.166,Come here. Stay with me. Look at me.
00:21:15.583,00:21:17.375,Look at me. You're gonna be okay.
00:21:21.250,00:21:22.875,Nile! Nile!
00:21:25.416,00:21:28.666,You're okay. It's okay. Stay with me. Just look at me. Look at me.
00:21:29.625,00:21:32.250,Okay. Medic's on their way. Medic's on their way.
00:21:32.333,00:21:33.791,"No, no. It's okay. It's okay."
00:21:34.500,00:21:35.625,The medic's coming!
00:22:47.125,00:22:48.125,What the...
00:22:53.875,00:22:55.291,"No, not another one."
00:22:56.708,00:22:57.625,Not now.
00:22:57.708,00:22:58.750,It was a woman.
00:22:59.708,00:23:00.708,A black woman.
00:23:01.291,00:23:03.041,I saw an older woman in a hijab.
00:23:07.375,00:23:08.250,What did you see?
00:23:08.666,00:23:09.833,I saw...
00:23:09.916,00:23:11.291,I saw part of a name tag.
00:23:11.375,00:23:13.708,"Uh, yeah. Free... free something."
00:23:14.125,00:23:16.166,"-Yeah. -Dirt floor, clay walls."
00:23:16.250,00:23:17.125,And a medevac.
00:23:21.041,00:23:22.041,medical team.
00:23:22.458,00:23:25.291,The knife was a pesh-kabz. Pashtun.
00:23:30.208,00:23:31.083,Combat.
00:23:33.083,00:23:34.416,Or near-combat duty.
00:23:36.958,00:23:38.000,Afghanistan.
00:23:41.875,00:23:44.208,It's been over 200 years.
00:23:45.875,00:23:46.958,Why now?
00:23:48.541,00:23:50.333,"Everything happens for a reason, boss."
00:23:53.583,00:23:55.208,We have to find her.
00:23:55.291,00:23:57.666,"No, we stick to the plan. We find Copley."
00:23:57.750,00:24:00.125,"-So we just leave her out in the open? -No, we're in the open."
00:24:00.208,00:24:02.291,-We're the ones who are exposed now. -Not like her.
00:24:02.375,00:24:04.375,Nicky-- Not like her.
00:24:04.458,00:24:07.125,You can't tell me you don't remember what it was like.
00:24:07.583,00:24:15.916,"Whoever she is, she's confused, and she's scared, and she's more alone than she has ever been in her entire life."
00:24:16.000,00:24:17.666,We all remember what it was like.
00:24:27.708,00:24:28.875,I'll handle the retrieval.
00:24:28.958,00:24:30.125,"Hey, boss, come on."
00:24:30.208,00:24:32.708,"If we're dreaming about her, she's dreaming about us."
00:24:32.791,00:24:34.583,That makes her a beacon straight to us.
00:24:34.666,00:24:37.291,-What do we do in the meantime? -Get to France.
00:24:37.375,00:24:38.750,Use the Charlie safe house.
00:24:39.458,00:24:40.458,I'll meet you there.
00:24:42.333,00:24:43.500,Find Copley.
00:24:48.583,00:24:49.666,Jesus.
00:24:50.500,00:24:51.708,She's just a baby.
00:25:27.250,00:25:29.416,"Adrenaline flying, everyone was seeing shit they didn't."
00:25:29.500,00:25:31.666,I was holding her neck together in my hands.
00:25:32.375,00:25:34.541,You'd rather we sent her home in a body bag?
00:25:35.708,00:25:37.291,"No, of course not."
00:25:37.375,00:25:38.291,So come on.
00:25:51.208,00:25:52.166,Nile?
00:25:55.500,00:25:56.583,"What's up, Jay?"
00:25:57.833,00:25:58.708,"What's up, Dizzy?"
00:25:59.125,00:26:00.333,So let's see the trophy.
00:26:11.750,00:26:13.208,Fuck me.
00:26:13.291,00:26:15.583,"Nile, there's not even a scratch."
00:26:16.125,00:26:17.666,"Yeah, they, uh..."
00:26:18.333,00:26:20.791,They used this new skin graft or something.
00:26:21.666,00:26:22.875,That what the doctor said?
00:26:27.250,00:26:28.416,That's what they said.
00:26:47.708,00:26:50.875,"Actually, two more years if you're lucky enough to be born a female."
00:26:53.208,00:26:56.916,"Now, all of this is because of everyone's favorite love-to-hate..."
00:26:58.166,00:26:59.375,Big Pharma.
00:26:59.875,00:27:06.458,"At my company, our research on telomere extension has reversed the chromosomal clock of human stem cells."
00:27:06.541,00:27:14.166,"Dr. Kozak's manipulation of the klotho hormone will, in time, completely arrest common cognitive decline."
00:27:14.250,00:27:17.250,"Yes, we can all wave goodbye to dementia."
00:27:19.125,00:27:22.875,Our work will add years of life to the collective world population.
00:27:27.166,00:27:28.583,But it's not cheap.
00:27:29.625,00:27:31.291,We need investment.
00:27:31.375,00:27:34.833,Investment drives my enthusiasm to take risks.
00:27:34.916,00:27:38.125,These risks improve countless lives.
00:27:47.375,00:27:48.666,Now you know they're for real.
00:28:05.791,00:28:07.333,What about the hard proof?
00:28:07.416,00:28:09.333,"Blood, tissue, bone, DNA."
00:28:09.750,00:28:13.708,Recovering an uncontaminated sample of the site proved impossible.
00:28:13.791,00:28:15.333,But you promised me hard proof.
00:28:15.416,00:28:17.916,There was an unanticipated amount of carnage.
00:28:19.083,00:28:20.125,"-But the footage-- -No, no."
00:28:20.208,00:28:22.833,The footage is a two-million-dollar snuff film.
00:28:23.458,00:28:25.083,It doesn't give her the how.
00:28:33.625,00:28:36.250,"-I think I can get you one. -No. No, not one. All."
00:28:36.333,00:28:39.083,These are extraordinary individuals.
00:28:39.166,00:28:41.708,They are extremely resistant to capture.
00:28:41.791,00:28:43.875,"Well, consult with Keane, make a plan, make it happen."
00:28:44.875,00:28:48.000,"And quickly, before my competitors get wind of this."
00:29:19.541,00:29:21.625,"-Aye, Sergeant. -Orders just came through."
00:29:21.708,00:29:24.583,"They're sending you to Landstuhl, Germany for more tests."
00:29:25.083,00:29:25.958,But I'm fine.
00:29:26.041,00:29:27.916,Plane's fueling. Pack your bags.
00:29:28.833,00:29:31.500,-Sergeant-- -We took these off you when it happened.
00:29:31.583,00:29:33.083,Didn't think you were coming back.
00:31:03.125,00:31:04.208,Been looking for you.
00:31:04.916,00:31:06.291,Wheels up on your ride.
00:31:12.708,00:31:14.750,-Who are you? -Andromache the Scythian.
00:31:19.750,00:31:21.000,But you can call me Andy.
00:32:50.791,00:32:54.375,Why does it have to be so goddamn slow the first couple of times?
00:33:12.125,00:33:13.458,You shot me.
00:33:13.541,00:33:15.625,"I did. I need you to get back in the car, please."
00:33:19.500,00:33:22.333,You haven't figured this out yet? You can't die.
00:33:22.416,00:33:23.333,Get up.
00:33:23.416,00:33:24.958,Argh! Fuck!
00:33:29.291,00:33:31.958,Can you please not do that again?
00:33:41.500,00:33:42.333,Who are you?
00:33:42.791,00:33:44.333,I lead a group of immortals.
00:33:45.333,00:33:46.416,"An army, I guess."
00:33:46.833,00:33:48.833,Soldiers. Fighters like you.
00:33:48.916,00:33:49.750,Look...
00:33:52.041,00:33:53.375,"You've got questions, kid."
00:33:53.458,00:33:54.291,I get it.
00:33:55.916,00:33:56.916,You want answers?
00:33:57.916,00:33:59.041,Get back in the car.
00:35:00.541,00:35:01.541,Put those on.
00:35:02.125,00:35:04.041,-Where are you taking me? -Paris.
00:35:05.666,00:35:08.125,-You've got blood in your hair. -Wonder why?
00:35:15.708,00:35:17.375,This the shit you into?
00:35:17.791,00:35:20.750,"Well, sometimes you gotta work with people you don't wanna eat with."
00:35:21.250,00:35:22.875,Is this even safe?
00:35:22.958,00:35:24.416,Does it really matter?
00:35:30.583,00:35:31.750,You found Copley?
00:35:32.333,00:35:33.625,Nothing but dead ends.
00:35:34.041,00:35:35.500,He knows we're hunting him.
00:35:35.583,00:35:36.416,Keep looking.
00:35:37.041,00:35:38.458,He's doing the same to us.
00:35:40.041,00:35:41.166,I have the new one.
00:35:41.583,00:35:42.416,And?
00:35:43.208,00:35:46.041,"Well, she stabbed me, so I think she has potential."
00:35:48.583,00:35:49.583,I'll see you soon.
00:37:11.416,00:37:13.250,So why is this happening to me?
00:37:14.375,00:37:15.541,I wish I knew.
00:37:15.625,00:37:17.291,You said you had answers.
00:37:17.791,00:37:19.250,I didn't say you'd like them.
00:37:27.500,00:37:28.541,Are you praying?
00:37:32.125,00:37:33.291,God doesn't exist.
00:37:33.708,00:37:35.166,My God does.
00:37:36.083,00:37:39.166,"You know, there was a time when I was worshiped as a god."
00:37:46.958,00:37:47.958,Was that Him?
00:37:49.333,00:37:51.291,"Don't worry, I can't do shit like that."
00:37:52.958,00:37:54.541,None of it means anything anyway.
00:37:58.208,00:37:59.625,You said there were others.
00:38:00.416,00:38:01.250,How many?
00:38:01.750,00:38:02.666,Four.
00:38:03.458,00:38:05.416,You're an army of four?
00:38:06.250,00:38:07.958,So that's why you took me?
00:38:08.041,00:38:09.583,So I could join your army?
00:38:09.666,00:38:10.750,Yeah.
00:38:11.541,00:38:14.208,No. This is some bullshit.
00:38:17.708,00:38:19.750,"...must have hypnotized me, or..."
00:38:19.833,00:38:22.958,"or, uh, drugged me or something."
00:38:23.708,00:38:26.166,And that was a blank that you shot me with.
00:38:26.250,00:38:28.166,And I was the one who cut your throat.
00:38:29.333,00:38:30.250,Right?
00:38:36.791,00:38:37.666,"Listen, kid."
00:38:38.458,00:38:39.791,You already believe in...
00:38:42.500,00:38:44.708,You should just keep following that illogic.
00:38:45.916,00:38:48.208,You're already on board with the supernatural.
00:38:51.750,00:38:53.500,"If I were you, I'd get some sleep."
00:39:11.125,00:39:12.833,We're not going to Paris.
00:39:15.125,00:39:16.000,Andrei.
00:39:17.916,00:39:18.750,Come here.
00:39:20.166,00:39:21.000,Sit your ass down!
00:39:23.916,00:39:24.791,You listen to me.
00:39:25.208,00:39:26.666,Land this plane.
00:39:28.208,00:39:30.125,Trust me. She's not gonna shoot you.
00:39:31.541,00:39:32.375,I am.
00:39:40.291,00:39:41.750,Who's gonna fly the plane?
00:39:42.250,00:39:43.583,We don't need a pilot.
00:39:43.666,00:39:45.250,We can jump and survive.
00:39:45.833,00:39:47.750,I am not jumping from a plane!
00:39:53.041,00:39:55.833,Whoa! Shit! Maybe we do need a pilot.
00:40:01.125,00:40:02.208,I can fly a plane.
00:40:10.208,00:40:11.833,"You don't speak Russian, do you?"
00:40:12.291,00:40:13.125,Why?
00:40:14.708,00:40:16.625,Because I told the pilot to play dead.
00:40:36.083,00:40:37.666,"You really want to do this, kid?"
00:41:39.833,00:41:40.666,We're done.
00:41:48.833,00:41:50.083,I said we're done.
00:42:07.666,00:42:08.625,You're very good.
00:42:16.416,00:42:17.541,What's your name?
00:42:19.875,00:42:20.750,Nile.
00:42:25.833,00:42:27.875,You see? You're already healing faster.
00:42:46.208,00:42:47.375,Is this real?
00:42:51.833,00:42:53.250,I got people that love me.
00:42:54.333,00:42:55.750,People that are gonna worry.
00:43:00.833,00:43:02.250,I'm a Marine.
00:43:02.333,00:43:05.083,-They think I went AWOL. -You're not a Marine anymore.
00:43:05.166,00:43:06.833,They're going to lock you up.
00:43:42.166,00:43:44.291,I thought you said we were going to Paris.
00:43:44.791,00:43:46.541,We're just outside of Paris.
00:43:46.625,00:43:47.791,This is Goussainville.
00:43:48.541,00:43:50.666,This place has been abandoned for 50 years.
00:44:15.625,00:44:17.583,So are you good guys or bad guys?
00:44:19.333,00:44:20.625,Depends on the century.
00:44:22.458,00:44:24.333,We fight for what we think is right.
00:44:29.750,00:44:31.458,How are you all in my dreams?
00:44:32.416,00:44:35.166,We dream of each other. They stop when we meet.
00:44:37.416,00:44:40.666,I believe it's because we... we're meant to find each other.
00:44:43.208,00:44:44.583,It's like destiny.
00:44:44.666,00:44:47.333,"No, more like misery loves company."
00:44:52.250,00:44:53.375,What he said.
00:44:53.458,00:44:55.916,It used to take years to track a new one.
00:44:56.000,00:44:57.208,Booker was the last.
00:44:58.041,00:44:58.916,1812.
00:45:01.416,00:45:02.375,No way.
00:45:03.083,00:45:06.041,"Yeah, I died fighting with Napoleon."
00:45:06.458,00:45:10.041,So... you're even older than him.
00:45:10.625,00:45:13.500,Mmm... Nicky and I met in the Crusades.
00:45:13.583,00:45:14.791,The Crusades?
00:45:14.875,00:45:18.125,The love of my life was of the people I've been taught to hate.
00:45:20.333,00:45:21.541,We killed each other.
00:45:28.083,00:45:29.375,You're the oldest.
00:45:32.416,00:45:33.250,Yeah.
00:45:33.833,00:45:34.958,So how old are you?
00:45:37.291,00:45:39.500,-Old. -How old?
00:45:42.500,00:45:43.583,Too old.
00:45:46.291,00:45:48.166,So we really never die.
00:45:48.958,00:45:50.791,Nothing that lives lives forever.
00:45:51.250,00:45:53.666,But... you said that we were immortal.
00:45:53.750,00:45:54.833,I know what I said.
00:45:57.166,00:45:59.791,"And we mostly are, but we can die."
00:46:01.291,00:46:02.375,And one of us did.
00:46:03.833,00:46:04.791,He...
00:46:05.291,00:46:07.541,"He was a warrior, just like us."
00:46:08.166,00:46:09.416,A long time ago.
00:46:10.583,00:46:13.500,"One day your wounds just don't heal up anymore, and..."
00:46:14.125,00:46:16.250,we don't know when or why.
00:46:17.833,00:46:23.708,"So if we can die, then why would you shoot me?"
00:46:24.500,00:46:25.958,You could have killed me.
00:46:27.375,00:46:28.458,You're too new.
00:46:33.791,00:46:35.583,It is a lot to understand.
00:46:37.833,00:46:39.500,I think you should get some rest.
00:46:40.708,00:46:41.666,Come with me.
00:46:41.750,00:46:42.583,I'll show you.
00:46:51.625,00:46:53.291,She wants to talk to her family.
00:46:55.250,00:46:56.666,That's not gonna help her.
00:46:59.541,00:47:00.583,You tell her that.
00:47:37.666,00:47:38.666,What's going on?
00:47:54.666,00:47:55.541,Tell us.
00:47:57.083,00:47:58.833,I saw flashes of it before...
00:48:00.291,00:48:02.000,when I first dreamt of all of you.
00:48:04.166,00:48:06.208,But now it's clearer.
00:48:09.541,00:48:12.041,I dreamed about a woman locked in an iron coffin...
00:48:13.166,00:48:14.208,under the sea.
00:48:16.291,00:48:17.125,She kept...
00:48:17.833,00:48:20.750,drowning and then coming back to life.
00:48:22.583,00:48:26.333,She was hammering her bloody fists and knees against the iron.
00:48:26.416,00:48:30.375,"She felt like something insane, something furious."
00:48:31.916,00:48:33.041,But she kept fighting...
00:48:33.916,00:48:35.541,and she kept drowning.
00:48:45.916,00:48:47.250,Her name was Quynh.
00:48:52.458,00:48:54.416,The first immortal Andy found.
00:49:00.125,00:49:02.791,"They had been alone so long, when she found her..."
00:49:03.666,00:49:04.625,Quynh had given up.
00:49:08.333,00:49:10.250,"Way back, it was her and Andy."
00:49:11.541,00:49:13.958,"Before me and Nicky, it was just the two of them."
00:49:15.291,00:49:19.000,They ran through the world together. Fought thousands of battles side by side.
00:49:27.000,00:49:28.791,She was a pit viper in a fight.
00:49:35.541,00:49:38.833,freeing so-called heretics from the witch trials.
00:49:39.625,00:49:55.583,"But then, Andy and Quynh, they were accused of witchcraft themselves, and they got sentenced again and again."
00:50:00.625,00:50:02.750,I've never been burned alive before.
00:50:03.666,00:50:05.208,What do you think it's gonna be like?
00:50:06.833,00:50:08.125,Excruciating.
00:50:16.125,00:50:17.125,Just you and me.
00:50:18.875,00:50:19.916,Until the end.
00:50:34.833,00:50:36.500,No! No!
00:50:36.583,00:50:37.458,"No, not this."
00:50:42.458,00:50:44.916,"For creatures such as you, there is no salvation."
00:50:47.500,00:50:48.541,Quynh!
00:50:53.208,00:50:54.500,Quynh!
00:51:31.541,00:51:34.958,or anyone on that ship who could tell us where she was cast off.
00:51:37.916,00:51:40.708,but she blames herself for Quynh's fate.
00:51:46.083,00:51:47.583,Why do you blame yourself?
00:51:48.583,00:51:49.833,I lost a soldier.
00:51:52.125,00:51:53.541,I feel her pain.
00:51:54.500,00:51:55.750,Her rage.
00:51:57.041,00:51:58.416,She feels crazy.
00:52:00.541,00:52:02.833,Over 500 years in a box...
00:52:04.208,00:52:05.666,at the bottom of the ocean...
00:52:07.416,00:52:08.791,would make anyone insane.
00:52:13.125,00:52:15.041,Spend eternity in a cage.
00:53:01.333,00:53:02.416,I don't want any of it.
00:53:02.500,00:53:03.750,I know. I know.
00:53:03.833,00:53:06.333,There isn't one good thing in any of this.
00:53:06.416,00:53:08.041,I know this is hard.
00:53:10.375,00:53:12.333,It's happening whether you want it or not.
00:53:21.625,00:53:23.500,"I know you're scared, Nile."
00:53:24.833,00:53:28.000,Me and those three men in there will keep you safe.
00:53:29.916,00:53:31.041,Like Quynh?
00:53:37.416,00:53:38.583,We're all you've got.
00:53:46.833,00:53:47.791,What's happening?
00:53:49.250,00:53:50.125,They found us.
00:54:00.500,00:54:02.125,Joe? Nicky?
00:54:08.000,00:54:09.208,Shit.
00:54:09.958,00:54:10.875,Booker.
00:54:13.666,00:54:14.916,You still with me?
00:54:17.791,00:54:19.833,Clear the back room. Find Joe and Nicky.
00:54:20.500,00:54:21.500,Hey.
00:54:21.583,00:54:22.416,Hey.
00:54:23.166,00:54:24.000,Book.
00:54:26.541,00:54:27.458,Come on.
00:54:28.250,00:54:29.416,Come back to me.
00:54:31.833,00:54:33.916,You're still in this shitty game with me.
00:54:34.333,00:54:35.333,You hear me?
00:54:37.166,00:54:38.291,Now wake up.
00:54:55.583,00:54:57.041,"Welcome back, asshole."
00:54:58.333,00:54:59.625,Thanks for taking your time.
00:55:02.916,00:55:04.333,It hurts everywhere.
00:55:05.208,00:55:06.166,How bad is it?
00:55:07.791,00:55:08.916,It's an improvement.
00:55:11.583,00:55:12.500,How many?
00:55:13.500,00:55:14.333,I don't know.
00:55:14.416,00:55:16.541,-Where are Nicky and Joe? -I don't know!
00:55:18.000,00:55:19.666,I... I turned on the game.
00:55:24.000,00:55:26.333,Lost the plot after that.
00:55:31.583,00:55:33.541,"Wasn't there, and the other guy's in pieces."
00:55:35.000,00:55:35.833,She's there.
00:55:37.583,00:55:38.791,-Copley. -Copley?
00:55:41.041,00:55:42.208,You stay here.
00:55:42.916,00:55:44.000,Wait for my signal.
00:55:44.625,00:55:45.458,What signal?
00:55:52.750,00:55:55.333,"And, by the way, it's not always like this now."
00:55:56.083,00:55:57.916,Big wounds take longer to heal.
00:55:58.541,00:55:59.500,Sure.
00:57:09.000,00:57:10.041,We need to help her.
00:57:10.125,00:57:11.583,"No, that's not the signal."
00:57:28.916,00:57:33.625,"Mr. Keane, I strongly recommend that we leave right now."
00:57:46.666,00:57:47.625,Let's move!
00:57:47.708,00:57:49.083,Wait for the signal.
00:57:49.166,00:57:51.041,How the hell can you even tell?
00:57:54.458,00:57:55.916,-Oh. -Let's go!
00:58:10.791,00:58:12.250,Andy did all this herself?
00:58:13.291,00:58:17.500,Yeah. That woman has forgotten more ways to kill than entire armies will ever learn.
00:58:20.125,00:58:21.416,I don't know. Let's go!
00:58:55.333,00:58:56.291,Nicolo.
00:58:59.750,00:59:01.208,What are you gonna do? Kill me?
00:59:14.791,00:59:16.083,I need to know he's okay.
00:59:18.333,00:59:19.708,What is he? Your boyfriend?
00:59:23.375,00:59:24.208,You're a child.
00:59:25.208,00:59:26.041,An infant.
00:59:26.833,00:59:28.458,Your mocking is thus infantile.
00:59:28.541,00:59:30.083,He's not my boyfriend.
00:59:30.791,00:59:33.375,This man is more to me than you can dream.
00:59:34.125,00:59:37.958,He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness and warmth when I shiver in cold.
00:59:38.041,00:59:40.500,"And his kiss still thrills me, even after a millennia."
00:59:41.750,00:59:45.708,His heart overflows with the kindness of which this world is not worthy of.
00:59:45.791,00:59:49.416,I love this man beyond measure and reason. He's not my boyfriend.
00:59:53.875,00:59:55.416,He's all and he's more.
00:59:56.583,00:59:58.541,You're an incurable romantic.
01:00:22.166,01:00:25.291,I don't suppose it would be possible to get these chains off of us?
01:00:27.916,01:00:29.000,I guess not.
01:00:32.000,01:00:34.291,We are usually a better judge of character.
01:00:35.208,01:00:38.875,I suppose you are taking us to the person who paid for your betrayal.
01:00:40.291,01:00:41.666,It's a nice plane.
01:02:04.666,01:02:05.625,What is this place?
01:02:06.416,01:02:07.625,An abandoned mine.
01:02:09.500,01:02:12.375,We stumbled on it during the Baussenque Wars.
01:02:12.458,01:02:14.291,1150s maybe?
01:02:16.666,01:02:18.250,I used to keep my stuff here.
01:02:59.291,01:03:00.625,Is this a Rodin?
01:03:02.833,01:03:05.958,This is an honest-to-God Rodin.
01:03:07.125,01:03:07.958,Wait.
01:03:08.583,01:03:09.916,Did you know him?
01:03:18.083,01:03:19.416,Get to work finding Copley.
01:03:20.333,01:03:21.541,He's got Nicky and Joe.
01:03:32.750,01:03:33.666,I've got to go.
01:03:38.833,01:03:40.833,"Ah! Gentlemen, welcome."
01:03:44.291,01:03:46.000,"Together, we shall do such things."
01:03:46.083,01:03:49.708,"What they are yet, I know not, but they shall be the terrors of the Earth."
01:03:49.791,01:03:51.541,"Or, um, rather the saviors."
01:03:53.500,01:03:54.333,Lear...
01:03:55.250,01:03:56.291,Shakespeare.
01:03:57.291,01:03:59.500,"Um, can we take the cuffs off?"
01:03:59.583,01:04:01.291,"No, sir. We can't."
01:04:02.583,01:04:05.333,"My apologies. Let's get off on the right foot, shall we?"
01:04:05.416,01:04:08.250,"I'm Steven Merrick, youngest CEO in pharma."
01:04:08.958,01:04:10.875,Our work here is all about balance.
01:04:10.958,01:04:15.500,How do we push the scientific frontiers whilst also turning a little profit?
01:04:16.916,01:04:18.583,"There's your balance, asshole."
01:04:24.708,01:04:32.250,"Mr. Copley provided me with footage of your unique talent, but I prefer my evidence to be indisputable."
01:04:36.208,01:04:38.583,God damn it! Ugh!
01:04:38.666,01:04:39.875,Shit!
01:04:49.791,01:04:51.458,And a fair few quid to boot.
01:04:54.166,01:04:57.541,We brought a cancer drug to the market last quarter.
01:04:57.625,01:05:01.208,It's already saved hundreds of thousands of lives.
01:05:01.291,01:05:04.625,"Yet, in development, it killed a quarter of a million lab mice."
01:05:05.250,01:05:08.458,"Now, I didn't ask for their little permissions."
01:05:08.541,01:05:09.958,I'm not gonna ask for yours.
01:05:10.458,01:05:12.208,"He thinks you're a mouse, Nicky."
01:05:15.208,01:05:17.375,which could help every human being on Earth.
01:05:18.291,01:05:19.833,We're morally obliged to take it.
01:05:19.916,01:05:20.958,What?
01:05:28.666,01:05:29.500,No!
01:05:34.458,01:05:35.958,I'll keep you informed of my progress.
01:05:36.500,01:05:38.000,"Yes. Yes, you do that."
01:05:45.708,01:05:46.708,Mr. Merrick...
01:05:48.250,01:05:51.666,"this is about science, not profits..."
01:05:51.750,01:05:52.666,or sadism.
01:05:54.208,01:05:55.500,You owe me two more.
01:06:03.875,01:06:06.791,"Come on, Book. You've been working on that for hours."
01:06:08.375,01:06:10.750,He leaves no footprints. It's gonna take time.
01:06:10.833,01:06:12.083,You got a satellite link?
01:06:17.666,01:06:19.291,"Whoever he's working for, maybe?"
01:06:20.958,01:06:22.500,That's how we track militants.
01:06:31.958,01:06:33.625,I'm sure you already tried that.
01:06:33.708,01:06:35.583,"Yeah, it won't hurt to try again."
01:06:37.583,01:06:39.083,"You know how it works, Nile."
01:06:40.625,01:06:41.833,Get some sleep while you can.
01:06:41.916,01:06:43.666,I brought you a change of clothes.
01:06:48.291,01:06:49.625,I'm going out for a bit.
01:07:15.500,01:07:18.541,Just because we keep living doesn't mean we stop hurting.
01:07:27.833,01:07:28.791,Why us?
01:07:29.708,01:07:30.583,Yeah.
01:07:33.708,01:07:35.333,That way madness lies.
01:07:35.833,01:07:38.041,I thought you were the brains of this outfit.
01:07:43.625,01:07:45.041,Tell you what I do wonder...
01:07:47.541,01:07:48.583,is why you?
01:07:50.166,01:07:51.166,And why now?
01:07:55.208,01:07:56.416,How old is Andy?
01:07:57.333,01:07:59.750,"Well, she says she... she doesn't remember."
01:08:01.625,01:08:03.250,And she may not. I don't know.
01:08:05.000,01:08:08.916,But what I do know is she was alone for a long time before she found anyone like her.
01:08:09.416,01:08:10.500,A very long time.
01:08:11.083,01:08:13.125,What about you? You have someone?
01:08:15.833,01:08:17.000,Just my family.
01:08:24.458,01:08:25.916,I had three sons.
01:08:28.500,01:08:30.208,"And the youngest one, Jean-Pierre..."
01:08:32.458,01:08:33.708,was the last one to die.
01:08:33.791,01:08:35.250,He was 42 when...
01:08:36.791,01:08:38.333,cancer took him.
01:08:40.458,01:08:42.208,The only way is forward now.
01:08:42.291,01:08:43.250,What do you mean?
01:08:43.833,01:08:46.916,You'll always and forever be the young woman right there...
01:08:49.041,01:08:52.000,"but everyone around you, everyone you love..."
01:08:53.125,01:08:57.375,"is gonna grow old, is gonna..."
01:08:57.458,01:08:59.333,is gonna suffer and is gonna die.
01:09:07.375,01:09:09.000,And if you try to...
01:09:09.083,01:09:10.958,if you try to touch their lives...
01:09:11.958,01:09:14.041,"well, they will get to learn your secret."
01:09:15.125,01:09:17.625,"They will beg you to share it with them, and you won't be able to."
01:09:19.708,01:09:21.625,"And they won't believe you, of course."
01:09:25.541,01:09:26.833,And they will tell you...
01:09:28.791,01:09:30.041,that you don't love them.
01:09:31.125,01:09:33.416,That your love is weak...
01:09:35.083,01:09:36.166,or selfish.
01:09:37.958,01:09:39.416,And you will never forget...
01:09:41.666,01:09:42.625,the hate...
01:09:43.250,01:09:44.875,and despair in their eyes.
01:09:50.166,01:09:52.125,And you will know what it is to lose...
01:09:56.875,01:09:59.083,everyone you've ever loved.
01:11:00.333,01:11:01.750,Do you have a bathroom?
01:11:02.833,01:11:03.916,No.
01:11:07.958,01:11:09.208,But we have a storeroom.
01:11:12.583,01:11:13.833,Do you need help?
01:11:36.708,01:11:38.583,"Stitches would be better, but..."
01:11:38.666,01:11:39.875,this will help.
01:11:41.041,01:11:42.041,You haven't asked.
01:11:43.041,01:11:44.375,Your business is yours.
01:11:48.166,01:11:49.083,You need help.
01:11:50.166,01:11:51.416,What does it matter why?
01:11:53.916,01:11:55.791,"Today, I put this on your wound."
01:11:55.875,01:11:56.750,Tomorrow...
01:11:58.125,01:11:59.875,you help someone up when they fall.
01:12:03.916,01:12:05.333,We're not meant to be alone.
01:12:12.250,01:12:13.125,There.
01:12:15.416,01:12:16.458,This should do.
01:12:25.166,01:12:26.083,Thank you.
01:13:01.541,01:13:02.916,Why won't it stop?
01:13:04.208,01:13:05.500,This can't be happening.
01:13:05.583,01:13:06.416,Lykon.
01:13:08.583,01:13:09.458,It's time.
01:13:10.500,01:13:11.583,It's impossible.
01:13:36.375,01:13:38.500,Until we have results we can replicate.
01:13:42.833,01:13:44.833,Do you feel the wound trying to close?
01:13:49.000,01:13:51.333,"You've got the samples, blood, tissue, DNA."
01:13:51.916,01:13:56.291,"Well, you know the concept of proprietary data, and they're the product."
01:13:58.041,01:14:01.083,They go in the vault. They stay there under lock and key.
01:14:02.500,01:14:04.333,For... ever?
01:14:04.416,01:14:07.125,We can't have them strolling back out into the world...
01:14:07.916,01:14:09.791,into my competitors' laps.
01:14:10.500,01:14:15.041,"If this takes years, maybe decades, what does it matter to them?"
01:14:15.125,01:14:20.041,"If we can unlock their genetic code, the world will be begging us for the key."
01:14:21.666,01:14:22.500,Remarkable.
01:14:25.833,01:14:28.125,You will not be able to give him what he wants.
01:14:28.666,01:14:30.000,You think I go too far?
01:14:30.791,01:14:32.458,That I am unethical?
01:14:32.958,01:14:34.291,I would say immoral.
01:14:36.250,01:14:38.250,I believe this can change the world.
01:14:38.875,01:14:40.375,A fine justification.
01:14:41.041,01:14:43.291,I've heard it so many times before.
01:14:58.375,01:15:02.000,"As much as I like watching you sleep, I'm glad you're awake."
01:15:03.291,01:15:04.125,Bed head?
01:15:08.208,01:15:09.375,Nicely tousled.
01:15:15.875,01:15:18.041,"Do you know, I was thinking about Malta."
01:15:19.666,01:15:20.833,What time in Malta?
01:15:24.083,01:15:26.500,"Oh, that time in Malta."
01:16:10.750,01:16:12.000,You have my phone?
01:16:26.541,01:16:28.333,Killed in action when I was 11.
01:16:32.833,01:16:33.666,Here...
01:16:39.791,01:16:42.708,"My mom, she was drowning after he died."
01:16:43.666,01:16:47.416,"South Side of Chicago, a million different ways we could have went left."
01:16:49.083,01:16:50.375,She fought for us.
01:16:51.500,01:16:52.583,Never backed down.
01:16:53.541,01:16:55.416,Never let us back down either.
01:16:58.416,01:16:59.750,You come from warriors.
01:17:00.958,01:17:01.833,Yeah.
01:17:03.000,01:17:03.916,I do.
01:17:07.416,01:17:09.583,I can't remember what my mother looked like.
01:17:12.833,01:17:14.041,Or my sisters.
01:17:17.791,01:17:18.666,None of them.
01:17:27.750,01:17:29.208,it's what it leaves behind.
01:17:32.833,01:17:34.041,Things you can't forget.
01:17:36.875,01:17:38.541,I gave up searching for her.
01:17:43.291,01:17:45.666,I made Quynh a promise and I broke it.
01:17:53.833,01:17:55.416,I'm getting Joe and Nicky back.
01:17:59.125,01:18:00.208,Whatever it takes.
01:18:03.416,01:18:04.708,Whatever it takes?
01:18:10.041,01:18:10.916,Yes.
01:18:13.083,01:18:15.166,An address just outside of London.
01:18:21.958,01:18:22.791,We gotta go.
01:19:01.250,01:19:02.375,Go scout the back.
01:19:12.333,01:19:13.833,I can't do this.
01:19:14.333,01:19:15.250,"Yes, you can."
01:19:15.666,01:19:18.000,"I mean, I'm not doing this."
01:19:22.083,01:19:23.375,You're one of us now.
01:19:24.375,01:19:25.583,We would do the same for you.
01:19:25.666,01:19:28.208,-I never even had a choice. -None of us had a choice.
01:19:28.958,01:19:30.083,There isn't a choice.
01:19:30.958,01:19:36.083,"The day I died, I killed the guy that killed me."
01:19:38.166,01:19:40.208,"They try to condition us, you know?"
01:19:40.875,01:19:42.708,Thousands of hours of training.
01:19:42.791,01:19:44.291,"Two shots, quick kill."
01:19:46.916,01:19:48.791,But they can't teach you how to live with it.
01:19:49.208,01:19:50.833,"You've gotta feel it, Nile."
01:19:52.166,01:19:53.000,Every one.
01:19:53.666,01:19:55.333,I saw what you did in that church.
01:19:57.208,01:19:58.833,All those bodies.
01:19:59.916,01:20:01.458,Is that supposed to be me?
01:20:02.500,01:20:05.083,"Is that what we're supposed to do, and we don't even know why?"
01:20:05.166,01:20:08.291,You think knowing is gonna make you sleep better at night?
01:20:09.291,01:20:10.541,I can't be that.
01:20:13.541,01:20:21.458,"My family, they're gonna get old and I won't, but it'll be years before they realize that."
01:20:23.291,01:20:25.833,I still have time with them.
01:20:29.916,01:20:30.875,Here.
01:20:33.458,01:20:37.333,"Take the car, and when you ditch it, ditch the weapons."
01:20:40.500,01:20:41.500,You gonna be okay?
01:20:42.916,01:20:43.791,Always.
01:20:57.166,01:20:58.083,Where's Nile?
01:20:59.458,01:21:01.541,"You and me, Book. Now and always."
01:21:40.916,01:21:41.916,Empty?
01:21:49.250,01:21:50.166,Shit.
01:21:51.875,01:21:52.958,Andy.
01:22:32.000,01:22:33.416,Andromache the Scythian.
01:22:34.208,01:22:35.541,The eternal warrior.
01:22:37.166,01:22:38.666,-Book? -I'm right here.
01:22:47.375,01:22:48.541,Where are Joe and Nicky?
01:22:54.208,01:22:55.750,What are you doing?
01:22:56.875,01:22:58.541,"-What are you doing? -Andy, calm down!"
01:23:05.541,01:23:07.375,You set us up?
01:23:11.875,01:23:15.458,"When my wife died, I devoted myself to your work."
01:23:17.416,01:23:20.541,"I learned your secret history, written in the margins..."
01:23:22.083,01:23:23.375,passed on like legend.
01:23:24.291,01:23:28.208,"What was dismissed as a myth was, in fact, immortality."
01:23:29.166,01:23:32.125,You could help end... needless suffering.
01:23:42.541,01:23:44.833,Humanity needs you to share your gifts.
01:24:00.666,01:24:01.583,Why?
01:24:03.041,01:24:04.083,"Why, Book?"
01:24:04.166,01:24:06.291,"-Andy, listen-- -Why?"
01:24:08.833,01:24:13.416,"If Merrick can discover how we keep living, he might find a way how to end it."
01:24:18.208,01:24:19.166,Hey.
01:24:20.208,01:24:21.375,That's what you wanted.
01:24:22.416,01:24:24.500,"Oh, Book. What have you done?"
01:24:28.666,01:24:30.333,"Not like this, Book."
01:24:39.041,01:24:40.208,You're still bleeding.
01:24:40.833,01:24:42.375,What? Shit.
01:24:42.458,01:24:43.416,She's not healing.
01:24:44.125,01:24:45.625,-What? -Look at this. She's not healing.
01:24:45.708,01:24:48.291,Go get something. Go on! Go on!
01:24:51.125,01:24:52.083,"Andy, look at me."
01:24:52.833,01:24:53.750,Look at me.
01:24:55.000,01:24:56.166,Why didn't you tell me?
01:25:00.041,01:25:02.083,It wouldn't have changed anything.
01:25:03.500,01:25:04.541,Hurry up!
01:25:06.625,01:25:07.500,Careful.
01:25:13.541,01:25:14.500,"Nice work, Copley."
01:25:17.625,01:25:18.666,Look at you.
01:25:19.083,01:25:21.041,She's wounded. Gunshot.
01:25:21.125,01:25:22.333,Why isn't she healing?
01:25:23.208,01:25:24.041,I don't know.
01:25:25.833,01:25:26.791,She's not immortal.
01:25:28.750,01:25:31.625,"-What do you mean, not immortal? -I mean it's gone."
01:25:40.125,01:25:41.541,You're a bloody mess.
01:25:46.041,01:25:47.208,"Now, how old are you?"
01:25:50.375,01:25:52.208,Come closer and I'll tell you.
01:25:55.708,01:25:57.083,Let's get them home.
01:26:14.750,01:26:16.000,I'm sorry.
01:26:21.500,01:26:26.583,"Mr. Merrick, look. If it's true and she's somehow not immortal anymore, then she might not survive the testing."
01:26:26.666,01:26:30.333,-This will be murder. -As if the CIA never disappeared anyone.
01:26:30.416,01:26:32.708,As if they never conducted covert research.
01:26:32.791,01:26:33.625,No.
01:26:34.666,01:26:36.083,"No, this is not what we agreed."
01:26:37.625,01:26:38.541,We don't stop.
01:26:49.041,01:26:50.000,Andy.
01:26:54.291,01:26:55.583,She's not healing.
01:26:57.958,01:26:58.875,I killed her.
01:27:06.666,01:27:08.833,I need to get a line in her and stop the bleeding.
01:27:11.833,01:27:15.166,"Don't you see? Between Sudan and now, something's changed."
01:27:18.166,01:27:23.833,but I have to stitch her All things die.
01:27:25.916,01:27:26.750,What was that?
01:27:26.833,01:27:29.125,"Everything has to die, Mr. Merrick."
01:27:31.708,01:27:33.291,The only reason we haven't...
01:27:34.291,01:27:35.750,is that it's not our time yet.
01:27:37.125,01:27:40.125,"If it's now Andromache's, nothing you can do will stop it."
01:27:40.208,01:27:42.833,You'd be surprised by what my products can do.
01:27:45.916,01:27:48.750,I will carve slices off you for years to get what I want.
01:27:50.625,01:27:51.875,Your time is coming.
01:27:52.291,01:27:53.375,As is yours.
01:27:57.958,01:28:00.208,I expect results!
01:28:03.875,01:28:04.958,Andy.
01:28:16.500,01:28:17.916,Are you Copley?
01:28:18.000,01:28:20.166,-He sent you to finish me off. -Who?
01:28:22.458,01:28:24.583,Where's Andy and Booker?
01:28:24.666,01:28:25.916,Who are you?
01:28:32.625,01:28:33.458,You're another one.
01:28:34.375,01:28:36.416,Yeah. I'm new.
01:28:37.625,01:28:39.458,-Where are they? -They're in a lab...
01:28:39.875,01:28:40.708,being tested.
01:28:42.958,01:28:43.791,Tortured.
01:28:44.708,01:28:45.625,Merrick...
01:28:46.041,01:28:51.041,"he only cares about her immortality, not what she's done with it."
01:28:51.541,01:28:52.791,What she's done with it?
01:28:55.916,01:29:00.791,She saved a family of refugees whose daughter would discover the technique for the early detection of diabetes.
01:29:02.041,01:29:03.125,This one...
01:29:03.208,01:29:07.625,Her grandson would save 317 people from the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
01:29:08.291,01:29:09.250,This guy...
01:29:09.333,01:29:15.458,This man prevented an accidental nuclear exchange in 1978 and likely saved civilization as a result.
01:29:17.666,01:29:18.500,The famous...
01:29:19.875,01:29:21.666,and the unknown names.
01:29:25.375,01:29:29.916,"She saves a life, two, three generations later, we reap the benefits."
01:29:34.958,01:29:36.000,She's in it.
01:29:38.000,01:29:39.041,She can't see it.
01:29:43.500,01:29:44.708,But you could.
01:29:45.500,01:29:47.750,You could and you gave them up.
01:29:48.583,01:29:50.375,I thought it could be the end of disease.
01:29:52.125,01:29:54.291,I thought it could be the end of suffering.
01:30:00.333,01:30:01.666,She couldn't talk...
01:30:03.333,01:30:04.250,at the end...
01:30:04.916,01:30:05.750,my wife.
01:30:08.625,01:30:09.916,She couldn't breathe.
01:30:11.458,01:30:12.666,I couldn't do...
01:30:13.291,01:30:14.208,anything.
01:30:17.041,01:30:18.708,It was supposed to be a gift...
01:30:20.541,01:30:21.375,to the world.
01:30:21.791,01:30:23.666,It wasn't your gift to give.
01:30:30.000,01:30:32.458,Why would the immortality end?
01:30:33.125,01:30:34.041,What?
01:30:35.000,01:30:36.416,She wouldn't stop bleeding.
01:30:39.083,01:30:40.208,Is she alive?
01:30:41.458,01:30:42.916,I know where they are.
01:31:19.041,01:31:20.250,There's no cameras here.
01:31:21.333,01:31:23.000,That's how he gets people in and out unseen.
01:31:27.000,01:31:29.416,"Their boss, Keane, is ex-Special Forces."
01:31:29.500,01:31:32.250,What kind of CEO rolls around with his own personal army?
01:31:35.083,01:31:35.916,Most of them.
01:31:36.583,01:31:38.583,-What are you doing? -I'm gonna make this right.
01:31:38.666,01:31:40.250,Your dying won't do that.
01:31:40.833,01:31:43.208,But I'm supposed to let you walk in there by yourself?
01:31:43.291,01:31:47.583,"Out of the two of us, I'm the one who will walk out of there again, one way or another."
01:31:52.583,01:31:53.625,You got me here.
01:31:59.416,01:32:01.416,There's a private lab on the 15th floor.
01:32:02.583,01:32:03.583,It's empty.
01:32:11.416,01:32:14.750,You should get out of here before the noise starts.
01:32:21.958,01:32:23.166,"Good luck, Ms. Freeman."
01:33:03.375,01:33:05.083,Floor's closed. How'd you get up here?
01:33:05.416,01:33:08.500,"Sorry, I was just looking-- Hands! Let me see your hands."
01:33:14.083,01:33:15.583,"Zero, this is Alpha 2-2."
01:33:20.458,01:33:21.375,Zero. Send.
01:33:26.041,01:33:27.958,See if you can get an ID off the body.
01:33:36.750,01:33:38.125,Shit!
01:33:38.208,01:33:39.791,"TAC teams, find Merrick now!"
01:33:46.583,01:33:49.750,"-You selfish piece of shit! -Joe, leave it. Please!"
01:33:49.833,01:33:52.041,What do you know of the weight of all these years alone?
01:33:55.625,01:33:57.375,"You and Nicky always had each other, right?"
01:33:58.083,01:33:59.416,And all we had...
01:34:00.125,01:34:00.958,was our grief.
01:34:01.041,01:34:03.208,"Well, now you have even more."
01:34:11.583,01:34:13.333,-Who the hell are you? -Where's the lab?
01:34:26.208,01:34:27.208,Shit!
01:34:32.333,01:34:34.833,"She's going for the rest of them. Doctor's lab, now!"
01:34:34.916,01:34:37.625,I'm locking you down in the penthouse until this is over.
01:35:03.458,01:35:06.083,There's four shooters at the door and more coming.
01:35:13.333,01:35:14.166,Andy.
01:35:20.958,01:35:24.416,"Immortal or not, you made a promise."
01:35:25.125,01:35:26.791,Whatever it takes.
01:35:28.791,01:35:30.208,"I've seen it, Andy."
01:35:31.541,01:35:33.166,I know all the good you've done.
01:35:44.666,01:35:45.708,You came back.
01:35:48.833,01:35:49.708,Yeah.
01:35:52.500,01:35:53.791,"No, just leave me here."
01:35:54.291,01:35:55.833,No man left behind.
01:35:55.916,01:36:00.750,There's always a first time. He's nothing but a traitor. That's-- Stop! This is not the time for it.
01:36:02.083,01:36:04.541,We don't get a say in when it ends. We never have.
01:36:05.333,01:36:06.916,But we can control how we live.
01:36:08.541,01:36:14.291,"And to be honest, Book, you and I, we've been doing a shit job of it."
01:36:14.708,01:36:15.583,"Now, get up."
01:36:17.416,01:36:20.458,We stop Merrick here and now or he never stops coming after us.
01:36:31.125,01:36:32.000,Are you sure?
01:36:32.416,01:36:33.666,This changes nothing.
01:36:34.458,01:36:36.125,We walk out of here like always.
01:36:37.000,01:36:37.833,Together.
01:36:39.000,01:36:40.583,Let's get this motherfucker.
01:38:43.833,01:38:46.291,"Assault team, move! You two, flank."
01:40:02.791,01:40:04.500,Let's go. Andy.
01:40:07.375,01:40:08.916,Come on. Come on. Come on.
01:40:13.791,01:40:15.041,Shit! Jammed!
01:40:20.333,01:40:21.375,Where's Andy?
01:41:08.625,01:41:09.666,Where's Merrick?
01:41:16.125,01:41:17.375,Penthouse.
01:41:21.250,01:41:23.375,"What do you think? Oslo, '67?"
01:41:23.458,01:41:25.958,"São Paulo, '34. Nile's with me."
01:41:26.041,01:41:28.041,What happened in São Paulo in 1934?
01:41:28.125,01:41:29.375,1834.
01:41:30.083,01:41:31.000,You'll see.
01:41:40.333,01:41:42.125,"First team, hold the hall."
01:41:50.833,01:41:51.750,First team.
01:42:00.708,01:42:01.750,Wait for the signal.
01:42:02.583,01:42:04.125,This gonna be like the last signal?
01:42:05.791,01:42:07.166,Go big or go home.
01:42:09.833,01:42:10.750,Keane.
01:42:12.875,01:42:15.041,"Keane, how many more do we have coming?"
01:42:15.125,01:42:17.250,This is it. Dig in.
01:42:26.666,01:42:27.666,I'll make the entry.
01:42:28.291,01:42:29.666,"Stay tight to me, okay?"
01:42:30.291,01:42:31.291,I'll protect you.
01:42:34.208,01:42:35.458,I go through first.
01:42:35.541,01:42:36.916,I always go first.
01:42:37.000,01:42:39.041,"Andy, put on the damn armor."
01:42:39.125,01:42:42.041,"It's like Nicky said, If it's my time, it's my time."
01:42:43.791,01:42:48.958,"If this doesn't work out, next time, you go first."
01:42:59.291,01:43:01.708,What the hell are they waiting for?
01:43:36.416,01:43:37.666,You shot Nicky.
01:43:38.291,01:43:39.833,You shouldn't have done that.
01:43:57.416,01:43:59.208,-Merrick is getting away! -Go!
01:44:00.000,01:44:01.041,I'll stay with Andy.
01:44:15.666,01:44:16.500,You okay?
01:44:20.000,01:44:21.000,It just hurts.
01:44:25.083,01:44:26.583,"Actually, everything hurts."
01:44:28.291,01:44:30.166,"Well, wait until tomorrow."
01:44:36.083,01:44:37.000,Can't wait.
01:44:46.833,01:44:49.541,I think you showed up when I lost my immortality.
01:44:50.333,01:44:52.083,So I could see what it was like.
01:44:53.541,01:44:54.750,So I could remember.
01:44:55.833,01:44:56.750,Remember?
01:44:57.916,01:44:58.958,Remember what it...
01:45:05.208,01:45:06.208,Remarkable.
01:45:11.500,01:45:13.833,You reminded me there are people...
01:45:15.208,01:45:16.750,still worth fighting for.
01:45:26.750,01:45:30.083,I know how I want to spend the time I've got left.
01:45:31.333,01:45:33.833,"You're gonna spend it with us, Andy."
01:45:35.541,01:45:37.833,You selfish little bitch!
01:45:37.916,01:45:39.333,I will kill her!
01:45:44.500,01:45:46.666,All the lives you could save.
01:45:49.583,01:45:52.583,Don't you see what we could do here?
01:45:52.666,01:45:54.125,You are priceless.
01:45:55.958,01:45:56.791,"Hey, Nile."
01:45:59.291,01:46:00.833,Do you think he speaks Russian?
01:46:22.083,01:46:23.541,"Play dead, motherfucker."
01:46:38.916,01:46:39.750,Hey.
01:46:52.416,01:46:53.250,Come on.
01:46:55.041,01:46:56.291,Faster than the elevator.
01:48:41.083,01:48:42.333,They're still deciding.
01:48:45.708,01:48:48.625,There's not much to decide. It's not like they can kill me.
01:48:57.458,01:48:58.291,Yeah.
01:49:00.666,01:49:01.875,Talked to Copley.
01:49:03.958,01:49:05.166,Said he could fix it.
01:49:08.000,01:49:10.333,Make it look like I was killed in action.
01:49:13.041,01:49:15.583,"My family will mourn, but, uh..."
01:49:18.833,01:49:20.333,...they'll be able to move on.
01:49:23.125,01:49:25.083,It's just like what we did with my dad.
01:49:28.125,01:49:30.916,I just really want to hear my mom's voice one more time.
01:49:34.833,01:49:36.125,"You're a good kid, Nile."
01:49:38.750,01:49:40.875,You're gonna be great for the team.
01:50:05.083,01:50:06.458,There's got to be a price.
01:50:11.375,01:50:13.958,"One hundred years from today, they'll meet you here."
01:50:16.666,01:50:17.958,"Till then, you're alone."
01:50:25.875,01:50:27.416,"I hoped for less, but..."
01:50:29.750,01:50:31.000,I expected more.
01:50:31.833,01:50:34.250,Nile was gonna let you off with an apology.
01:50:39.916,01:50:41.291,Just give her some time.
01:50:52.875,01:50:54.000,I'm gonna miss you.
01:51:20.750,01:51:21.916,Um...
01:51:22.416,01:51:23.791,I won't see you again.
01:51:28.708,01:51:30.083,"Have a little faith, Book."
01:52:26.208,01:52:33.083,"When you think about how old you are, the good you've done for humanity becomes exponential."
01:52:34.958,01:52:36.833,"Maybe this is the why, Andy."
01:52:43.833,01:52:47.250,It's nearly impossible to disappear in the world we live in today.
01:52:49.041,01:52:52.500,There are too many people like you who can bend it to your will.
01:52:54.000,01:52:55.583,Too many with bad intentions.
01:52:57.500,01:53:00.875,"We don't have all the answers, but we do have purpose."
01:53:03.625,01:53:04.916,And you're going to help us.
01:53:10.083,01:53:15.958,"When we leave a footprint in the sand, in the snow, in the ether, you're going to sweep it."
01:53:16.833,01:53:22.250,"You're going to protect us from those who want to put us in cages, and you're gonna help us find those jobs..."
01:53:24.125,01:53:25.791,that are best suited to us.
01:53:28.666,01:53:29.958,She's not asking.
01:53:35.583,01:53:36.416,I'd be honored.
01:53:38.666,01:53:39.916,Then let's go to work.
01:54:39.125,01:54:40.875,It's nice to finally meet you.
