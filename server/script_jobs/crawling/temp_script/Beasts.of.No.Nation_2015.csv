00:01:35.428,00:01:36.554,Which one?
00:01:36.638,00:01:38.181,That girl. Zoey. Let's take her.
00:01:38.265,00:01:39.557,Ah... No.
00:01:40.725,00:01:42.144,What about that one?
00:01:42.227,00:01:43.228,Him?
00:01:43.311,00:01:44.312,Yes.
00:02:04.541,00:02:05.958,"And what am I gonna do with this, Agu?"
00:02:06.042,00:02:07.460,It's a TV. I'm selling it.
00:02:07.544,00:02:09.504,This dirty thing with no screen?
00:02:09.587,00:02:10.588,Let's go!
00:02:10.672,00:02:12.215,Soap opera.
00:02:12.299,00:02:13.466,Be quick!
00:02:50.086,00:02:52.129,It's garbage. All of you go away!
00:02:52.214,00:02:54.841,It's an imagination TV! How can you say it's garbage?
00:02:54.924,00:02:56.008,"It's garbage, Agu."
00:02:57.594,00:02:59.929,"Don't worry, let's go."
00:04:41.656,00:04:43.115,Taste this.
00:04:45.577,00:04:46.703,Thank you.
00:04:47.537,00:04:48.746,It's good.
00:05:35.335,00:05:38.505,What we need now is medicine.
00:05:50.266,00:05:51.267,Stop that!
00:05:52.519,00:05:54.020,When I get a hold of you...
00:05:54.521,00:05:55.522,Leave me alone!
00:05:55.605,00:05:56.606,You have no respect!
00:05:56.689,00:05:59.692,I was trying to make it warmer for you!
00:05:59.776,00:06:00.777,Leave me alone!
00:06:00.860,00:06:03.154,You're lucky I don't shit on you.
00:06:03.237,00:06:05.072,I'm gonna fart on your face.
00:06:09.243,00:06:13.998,I want to sleep with this girl before the war gets here.
00:06:21.380,00:06:24.341,Let me go! I didn't do anything to deserve this!
00:06:30.181,00:06:33.476,Let me go! I don't like this!
00:06:33.560,00:06:37.439,Treat your neighbor as your brother.
00:06:37.522,00:06:41.192,And treat the market vendor...
00:06:41.275,00:06:43.653,as your mother or older sister.
00:06:51.578,00:06:52.787,Say Amen!
00:06:53.871,00:06:54.956,Say it louder!
00:06:59.001,00:07:03.089,"Choir, give us a song and then we'll continue."
00:07:32.201,00:07:33.953,Cut that branch.
00:07:34.036,00:07:35.121,I'll fall.
00:07:35.204,00:07:36.330,Just hold on tight and cut it.
00:07:36.413,00:07:37.414,No way.
00:07:37.499,00:07:38.666,Then cut that one instead.
00:07:38.750,00:07:41.628,Have your lazy friend do it.
00:07:41.711,00:07:42.795,He's the driver. Cut that one.
00:07:42.879,00:07:45.131,"You're too small, you'll fall!"
00:07:45.214,00:07:47.133,-Shut up! -You shut up!
00:07:47.216,00:07:48.551,-Go home! -You go home!
00:07:48.635,00:07:49.636,Midget.
00:07:50.637,00:07:51.929,Cut it.
00:07:52.597,00:07:54.056,He wants me to fall.
00:07:54.140,00:07:56.350,"If I was a taxi driver, I'd drive around it."
00:08:02.982,00:08:04.776,Get ready!
00:08:09.113,00:08:10.114,What is this?
00:08:10.197,00:08:12.617,We've been working all day. Give us some money for our work.
00:08:12.700,00:08:13.910,Why did you block the road?
00:08:13.993,00:08:16.287,We are trying to fix it.
00:08:16.370,00:08:18.205,Get out of here!
00:08:18.289,00:08:19.331,But we need to eat!
00:08:19.415,00:08:20.792,Take this.
00:08:20.875,00:08:22.251,I don't want your chicken.
00:08:30.217,00:08:32.303,Why are children so disrespectful?
00:08:34.013,00:08:35.181,You!
00:08:35.264,00:08:36.390,Curse be upon you.
00:08:36.473,00:08:38.685,"Curse yourself, standing in the middle of the road."
00:08:38.768,00:08:40.186,I know you very well!
00:08:40.269,00:08:41.771,I know your whole family!
00:08:42.313,00:08:43.898,You're thieves!
00:08:43.981,00:08:45.817,"You stole my land! Me, an old woman!"
00:08:46.442,00:08:47.610,Do you want this chicken?
00:08:48.277,00:08:51.864,The devil will bless you one by one!
00:09:15.847,00:09:20.768,We saw that witch woman today. She said we were thieves.
00:09:20.852,00:09:22.770,Why would she say that?
00:09:22.854,00:09:25.064,That woman...
00:09:25.147,00:09:27.024,she's confused.
00:09:27.108,00:09:29.193,God has taken her mind.
00:09:29.276,00:09:31.278,Slow down.
00:09:32.238,00:09:34.448,The land we gave to the refugees...
00:09:34.531,00:09:36.951,has been in our family since before your grandfather.
00:09:37.034,00:09:39.203,"I gave her a place, but she refused."
00:09:39.286,00:09:41.038,So she's crazy?
00:10:05.354,00:10:06.397,What is this?
00:10:10.026,00:10:11.653,Who did this to my TV?
00:10:15.197,00:10:16.240,What is this?
00:10:50.900,00:10:56.030,"If I acted like you when I was your age, Dad would've beaten me."
00:10:56.113,00:10:59.200,You're lucky there's a war.
00:10:59.283,00:11:01.410,"It's not luck, everybody loves me."
00:11:02.161,00:11:03.454,Like who?
00:11:06.123,00:11:07.834,There she is.
00:11:09.711,00:11:10.962,She's looking at you!
00:11:11.045,00:11:12.296,Really?
00:11:12.379,00:11:13.380,Still?
00:11:13.464,00:11:14.924,She looked away.
00:11:21.764,00:11:23.265,Do you think she likes me?
00:11:23.349,00:11:24.726,My eyes are not good.
00:11:24.809,00:11:26.227,So you couldn't tell?
00:11:27.603,00:11:29.021,You don't know what's up.
00:11:29.105,00:11:33.025,"When she sees these muscles, she'll fall in love with me."
00:12:43.387,00:12:45.890,The NRC broke the agreement.
00:12:46.515,00:12:48.725,They've entered the buffer zone.
00:12:48.810,00:12:52.271,Now they want us to run away and leave our town.
00:12:52.354,00:12:53.480,We cannot do that.
00:12:53.564,00:12:55.232,Never.
00:12:55.316,00:12:57.443,This land is ours.
00:12:57.526,00:13:00.529,"Our ancestors have lived here, taken care of it, and left it for us."
00:13:00.612,00:13:03.032,It's our duty to protect it...
00:13:03.115,00:13:05.659,and leave it for our children.
00:13:07.744,00:13:13.167,So we should send the women and little children away...
00:13:13.250,00:13:15.837,under the protection of ECOMOD.
00:13:17.629,00:13:19.465,Where's Dike?
00:13:19.548,00:13:25.930,And we who call ourselves men will stay and protect our town.
00:13:27.181,00:13:30.559,Who is going to take care of the property we are leaving behind?
00:13:30.642,00:13:32.269,"Dad, where's Dike?"
00:13:32.353,00:13:33.520,They fled!
00:13:34.230,00:13:39.151,"Let me go, it's my duty."
00:13:42.238,00:13:48.202,We will be crushed between the rebels and the army! It is so bad!
00:13:48.827,00:13:51.538,We've already decided what to do with the children.
00:13:51.622,00:13:53.665,They will go with you.
00:13:53.749,00:13:56.252,He is old. We can't take him anywhere.
00:13:56.335,00:13:58.921,You aren't listening to what I'm saying.
00:13:59.005,00:14:01.924,"Go to your sister in the city, I'll meet you once everything is okay here."
00:14:02.008,00:14:03.175,I can't abandon my responsibilities.
00:14:03.259,00:14:04.426,But you are!
00:14:04.510,00:14:05.761,Don't think like that.
00:14:05.844,00:14:08.014,You want me to be a refugee in my own country?
00:14:08.097,00:14:09.932,With three small children and no husband?
00:14:10.016,00:14:11.433,We are a family.
00:14:12.309,00:14:13.852,We should stay together.
00:14:14.853,00:14:17.023,"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you."
00:14:17.106,00:14:21.360,There are bigger issues to take care of-- It's your turn.
00:14:21.443,00:14:23.070,Dad's sending me away.
00:14:23.154,00:14:26.198,He's sending you because you're a little baby.
00:14:27.699,00:14:28.993,Play the game.
00:14:33.455,00:14:35.624,Turn your light off.
00:14:35.707,00:14:38.210,Now turn it on and you'll feel better.
00:14:41.463,00:14:44.091,What kind of face is that?
00:14:45.259,00:14:48.512,Your face is like a monkey's butt.
00:15:04.486,00:15:06.989,Come on! Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
00:15:09.116,00:15:11.493,Hurry! I see one! Hurry!
00:15:12.536,00:15:14.121,Hurry!
00:15:20.044,00:15:21.503,This one's full. There's another here.
00:15:22.964,00:15:24.173,Wait. Help me.
00:15:24.256,00:15:25.341,Is it heavy? Give it to me.
00:15:25.424,00:15:26.425,"Agu, take it."
00:15:27.676,00:15:29.261,"Please, move. Move!"
00:15:50.992,00:15:52.284,I'd rather walk. I can't leave my child.
00:15:52.368,00:15:53.869,You can't walk!
00:16:02.836,00:16:04.338,I can't.
00:16:04.964,00:16:06.173,Get in!
00:16:06.257,00:16:07.549,I'll walk! I won't leave my child!
00:16:07.633,00:16:09.010,There's no other way! Get in!
00:16:12.554,00:16:15.182,Give her to her mother!
00:16:16.183,00:16:17.684,Give her to her mother!
00:16:21.647,00:16:24.025,Remember to pray to God everyday.
00:16:24.108,00:16:27.694,I'll see you very soon.
00:16:27.778,00:16:29.321,Always pray! Don't be afraid!
00:16:29.405,00:16:30.864,I will see you soon!
00:16:30.947,00:16:32.658,"We'll find you, okay?"
00:16:35.119,00:16:38.539,It's full! Everyone get back!
00:16:38.622,00:16:39.873,We'll find you!
00:16:39.956,00:16:41.208,Everything will be alright!
00:16:43.252,00:16:44.253,Take this!
00:16:47.964,00:16:50.134,"You're with the men now, keep quiet."
00:16:50.967,00:16:51.968,Calm down.
00:16:55.847,00:16:57.891,Calm down.
00:17:18.829,00:17:20.289,Let's go.
00:17:20.372,00:17:22.374,Let's go home.
00:17:41.643,00:17:44.063,Go take the clothes out of the rain.
00:17:44.146,00:17:46.398,"Agu, close the windows."
00:18:57.093,00:18:59.138,Come on! Hurry!
00:18:59.221,00:19:01.432,Stay here. I'll call you when it's clear.
00:19:17.072,00:19:18.865,Come on!
00:19:28.292,00:19:29.918,Hurry!
00:19:31.086,00:19:32.087,Hurry!
00:19:48.854,00:19:50.897,We need to go. If they catch us...
00:19:51.815,00:19:53.650,Keep quiet. They'll hear us.
00:19:58.864,00:20:01.867,"If we run away now, they won't see us."
00:20:02.534,00:20:05.496,Be patient. The soldiers are outside.
00:20:05.579,00:20:07.998,"If you talk, they'll find us. Keep quiet."
00:20:30.979,00:20:32.523,Whatever happens...
00:20:32.606,00:20:34.107,it's God testing us.
00:20:34.190,00:20:36.860,We have to be strong.
00:20:47.413,00:20:49.456,We have to go.
00:20:51.417,00:20:53.126,Open it.
00:20:53.209,00:20:54.586,Don't do it!
00:22:16.960,00:22:18.128,Run!
00:22:18.211,00:22:19.796,Run!
00:22:19.880,00:22:21.382,Run!
00:42:51.318,00:42:53.738,You must die...
00:42:53.821,00:42:55.447,before you are reborn.
01:19:36.897,01:19:38.565,Ma... Ma!
01:19:38.648,01:19:39.775,I'm not your mother!
01:19:40.733,01:19:41.944,I'm not your mother!
01:19:42.027,01:19:43.320,I found you!
01:19:48.283,01:19:50.035,I was looking for you!
01:19:53.455,01:19:54.664,I was looking for you!
01:20:02.130,01:20:03.799,You're not my mother!
01:20:03.882,01:20:05.968,Witch woman!
01:20:06.051,01:20:08.095,You're not my mother! You fooled me!
01:20:08.178,01:20:09.512,Witch woman!
00:01:30.923,00:01:32.884,They aren't good enough.
00:01:34.093,00:01:35.345,Let's take that girl.
00:01:46.606,00:01:48.858,and we are having no more school.
00:01:48.941,00:01:52.195,So we are having to be finding ways to be keeping busy.
00:02:17.304,00:02:18.138,-But why?
00:02:18.138,00:02:19.556,-But why? -Because you're not handsome. Go!
00:02:19.639,00:02:20.473,"-Oh, please, I beg."
00:02:20.473,00:02:21.683,"-Oh, please, I beg. -Don't follow me. Go!"
00:02:23.351,00:02:26.354,-Go! -And Dike is having the talent.
00:02:28.773,00:02:29.857,Dance! Dance! Dance!
00:02:40.117,00:02:41.077,-Kung fu! Kung fu!
00:02:44.956,00:02:47.375,Yeah!
00:02:47.459,00:02:48.585,Yes!
00:03:04.809,00:03:09.981,"My father is saying, Outside, people are suffering, but here we are safe."
00:03:10.064,00:03:14.193,That is why so many refugees are coming here small-small.
00:03:26.831,00:03:28.333,How am I supposed to watch this?
00:03:28.416,00:03:30.335,This is imagination TV.
00:03:30.418,00:03:33.004,The Nigerians are keeping the peace.
00:03:33.087,00:03:35.257,It is imagination TV.
00:03:40.303,00:03:41.846,3D!
00:03:46.934,00:03:49.812,Okay. How much for this treasure?
00:03:49.896,00:03:51.105,Three thousand.
00:03:51.188,00:03:53.358,Huh? Three thousand. Too much! Thousand five.
00:03:53.441,00:03:54.817,Thousand five no good.
00:03:57.111,00:03:58.905,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Thousand five."
00:04:03.951,00:04:06.663,"Uche, bring the foods and come."
00:04:13.378,00:04:15.255,"Here, take. Go!"
00:04:39.362,00:04:41.573,My mother is always working hard for us.
00:04:53.293,00:04:55.295,"Sara, small..."
00:04:55.378,00:04:56.588,-Soaring.
00:04:56.588,00:04:58.298,-Soaring. -Soaring overhead.
00:05:06.348,00:05:08.475,That's good. And another one!
00:05:10.477,00:05:11.728,That's good.
00:05:11.811,00:05:12.812,Agu!
00:05:12.895,00:05:14.439,Where do lions live?
00:05:15.440,00:05:16.441,In the zoo.
00:05:16.524,00:05:17.859,Shame him.
00:05:19.569,00:05:21.321,Who can tell me where lions live?
00:05:28.661,00:05:34.334,He is using some of our land so that the refugees can be making a new village.
00:05:40.798,00:05:43.968,He is more concerned with his muscles and his hair.
00:05:44.051,00:05:47.764,Sometimes I am adding to his soaps.
00:06:03.237,00:06:04.989,I'm gonna fart on your face.
00:06:24.341,00:06:27.011,I am not liking his dancing.
00:06:27.094,00:06:30.097,And how can that girl be sleeping if he is making so much noise?
00:06:41.275,00:06:43.570,as your mother or older sister.
00:06:45.822,00:06:51.494,"If you do not know what to be doing, you can always be asking God for the answer."
00:06:51.578,00:06:52.704,Say Amen!
00:07:13.850,00:07:18.855,"So if you are singing and dancing, then he will be listening to us well-well."
00:08:32.887,00:08:33.930,Huh?
00:09:10.132,00:09:13.761,"The lights are on, but nobody is home."
00:09:39.286,00:09:40.412,So she's crazy?
00:10:18.075,00:10:20.577,Agu! Agu!
00:11:38.740,00:11:39.907,within the interim government.
00:11:39.991,00:11:50.126,"As of this morning, the NRC junta moved to abolish all political parties, further consolidating their control of the government in the wake of the recent military coup."
00:11:50.209,00:12:08.185,"Lieutenant General Sangania, commander-in-chief of the armed forces responsible for the junta, stated in a recent press conference that it was his intention to rid the southern regions of the PLF, who he accused of being financed and supported by foreign institutions."
00:12:08.269,00:12:17.069,"He also condemned the Native Defense Force militias, who he said presented a threat to the very fabric of national security."
00:12:17.153,00:12:23.534,Sangania went on to promise that the junta would accomplish what the previous regime had failed to do.
00:12:23.617,00:12:27.872,Speculation on the collaboration between the armed forces and the PLF rebels...
00:13:19.548,00:13:25.471,And we who call ourselves men will stay and protect our town.
00:13:34.230,00:13:39.068,"Let me go, it's my duty."
00:15:11.493,00:15:12.954,"Citizens of the republic, living in the buffer zone."
00:15:14.121,00:15:19.961,The National Reformation Council recommend non-combatants to leave the buffer zone immediately...
00:15:21.587,00:15:22.879,...as military operations begin as planned.
00:15:27.676,00:15:29.178,"Please, move. Move!"
00:15:31.805,00:15:35.392,"Please, please, I am the Section Chief. This is my family. There must be space."
00:15:35.476,00:15:36.477,No space.
00:15:36.560,00:15:38.020,This one woman and this small-small children.
00:15:38.104,00:15:39.730,"-And the little boy? -Yes, him, too."
00:15:42.483,00:15:44.151,They're gonna be sitting in the front with you.
00:15:44.235,00:15:46.570,"No, no, no, no, no. Seventy thousand, no boy."
00:15:47.238,00:15:48.239,With the boy.
00:15:48.322,00:15:50.449,You wanting your woman to walk through the bush to the capital?
00:15:52.784,00:15:53.785,You can't walk!
00:15:55.121,00:15:56.497,"-Seventy thousand, no boy."
00:15:57.581,00:15:59.666,"Please, please, please. Hey, hey. With the boy!"
00:15:59.750,00:16:02.253,No boy. No bargaining.
00:16:59.476,00:17:03.022,Agu! Agu! Agu!
00:18:00.287,00:18:03.832,I am seeing the rainy season in my village.
00:18:03.915,00:18:08.837,You can be finding the ground is washing away beneath your feet.
00:18:08.920,00:18:14.510,Nothing is ever for sure... and everything is always changing.
00:18:50.837,00:18:52.131,Hey.
00:18:59.221,00:19:01.348,Stay here. I'll call you when it's clear.
00:19:17.072,00:19:18.782,Come on!
00:19:20.867,00:19:22.703,Hey!
00:19:51.815,00:19:53.567,Keep quiet. They'll hear us.
00:20:29.895,00:20:30.896,Agu...
00:20:47.413,00:20:49.373,We have to go.
00:20:51.417,00:20:53.084,Open it.
00:21:11.812,00:21:13.689,Give me a rope!
00:21:22.906,00:21:24.199,Which faction do you fight for?
00:21:26.452,00:21:28.829,We are from this town.
00:21:28.912,00:21:30.914,We are protecting the stores.
00:21:30.997,00:21:32.374,"-You are Native Defense Forces, hmm?"
00:21:32.374,00:21:33.375,"-You are Native Defense Forces, hmm? -No."
00:21:33.459,00:21:36.211,I am the Section Chief. We are trying to stop the looters.
00:21:36.295,00:21:37.921,Bring the woman.
00:21:38.004,00:21:39.340,-You are calling us looters.
00:21:53.770,00:21:55.814,"This woman, everybody knows she's crazy."
00:21:55.897,00:21:56.898,I don't know them.
00:21:56.982,00:21:59.693,"Master! Master, talk to her and you know that she's not right in the head."
00:21:59.776,00:22:01.653,They are not from here. They must be rebels.
00:22:06.450,00:22:10.454,"We, the armed forces of the National Reformation Council, find you all to be spies."
00:22:11.622,00:22:15.125,I sentence you to immediate and summary execution.
00:27:36.279,00:27:37.613,"-Wanna die, fucking PLF?"
00:27:37.613,00:27:38.448,"-Wanna die, fucking PLF? -Fucking rebel."
00:27:39.950,00:27:41.534,Tie this fucking spongebag up.
00:27:45.455,00:27:46.664,"-I'm gonna kill you, man!"
00:27:46.664,00:27:47.540,"-I'm gonna kill you, man! -This is not the right place."
00:27:56.257,00:27:57.258,Strip them.
00:28:09.771,00:28:12.774,Don't look at me.
00:28:18.780,00:28:21.074,You get out of the fucking way!
00:28:26.788,00:28:29.332,What is this thing doing here?
00:28:31.334,00:28:34.337,Who is responsible for bringing this thing?
00:28:39.342,00:28:42.345,"Strika, is it you that is bringing this thing?"
00:28:44.723,00:28:48.226,"Strika, untie him."
00:28:49.811,00:28:55.316,"So all of you grown men, it is Strika, the small boy, that is finding this prisoner."
00:28:56.943,00:28:58.236,Where is Two-I-C?
00:29:03.366,00:29:04.868,"Commandant, sir!"
00:29:04.951,00:29:08.663,"Two-I-C, what are we to be doing with this thing?"
00:29:09.455,00:29:12.375,This thing? It is just a boy.
00:29:13.126,00:29:14.753,A boy?
00:29:17.255,00:29:19.215,A boy is nothing.
00:29:19.299,00:29:21.134,A boy is harmless?
00:29:28.599,00:29:30.685,Why you saying a boy is nothing? Huh?
00:29:30.769,00:29:34.022,"A boy is very, very dangerous. You understand me?"
00:29:35.190,00:29:37.275,"-Very dangerous, you understand?"
00:29:37.275,00:29:38.193,"-Very dangerous, you understand? -Yes, sir!"
00:29:38.276,00:29:39.194,-Huh?
00:29:39.194,00:29:40.236,"-Huh? -Yes, sir!"
00:29:40.320,00:29:43.782,"Strika, are you hungry?"
00:29:43.865,00:29:46.993,Are you wanting to be eating this thing?
00:29:51.873,00:29:53.708,Let me see your hands.
00:29:57.921,00:30:00.799,"Oh, you have hands like a baby."
00:30:08.723,00:30:10.558,What are you doing here?
00:30:14.187,00:30:15.688,You should be telling me.
00:30:15.771,00:30:17.565,"If you are telling me, I will be helping you."
00:30:17.648,00:30:20.485,"You see, Strika is hungry. He will eat you."
00:30:20.568,00:30:21.736,Huh?
00:30:21.820,00:30:23.779,What are you doing here?
00:30:30.328,00:30:35.666,The government army killed my father... and my big brother...
00:30:36.835,00:30:41.756,and my father told me to run... into the bush.
00:30:48.263,00:30:50.306,Everybody here is calling me Commandant.
00:30:54.978,00:30:56.687,Ah.
00:30:56.771,00:30:59.149,"Now, what are they calling you?"

00:31:06.489,00:31:07.323,-Agu.
00:31:07.323,00:31:08.199,-Agu. -Uh-huh.
00:31:08.283,00:31:13.413,"Well, Agu, that is what I will be calling you then, eh?"
00:31:20.836,00:31:26.092,Leave this one under my charge. I will be training him to be a warrior.
00:31:26.176,00:31:28.803,So you can be fighting the army that is killing your father.
00:31:28.887,00:31:32.723,Is that what you want? You must be saying yes!
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.062,"-Yes, sir!"
00:31:37.062,00:31:37.896,"-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!"

00:31:52.535,00:31:53.786,"-Again. -Yes, sir!"
00:31:53.869,00:31:56.622,"Rambo, give this SBU some work."
00:31:57.790,00:31:59.250,You must carry this one.
00:31:59.334,00:32:03.338,I saved your life. I saved your life.
00:32:03.421,00:32:05.340,I saved your life. Go!
00:32:10.303,00:32:11.137,-Move out.
00:32:12.931,00:32:13.974,What are you waiting for?
00:32:14.057,00:32:15.976,"Move! Quick, quick, quick."
00:32:16.767,00:32:19.187,Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it!
00:32:19.270,00:32:23.233,Move! Move! Move it!
00:34:22.935,00:34:24.270,"-How our Commandant look? -All right, sir."
00:34:24.354,00:34:25.271,-How the Commandant look?
00:34:25.271,00:34:26.272,"-How the Commandant look? -All right, sir!"
00:34:26.356,00:34:27.857,"-How our Commandant look? -All right, sir!"
00:34:27.940,00:34:30.068,You are now under NDF control.
00:34:30.151,00:34:32.487,"If you're willing to stay, then stay."
00:34:32.570,00:34:34.655,But you must be initiated.
00:34:34.739,00:34:35.573,-Am I clear?
00:34:37.700,00:34:39.034,Show them what I'm talking about.
00:34:50.130,00:34:51.506,Bring me the small boy.

00:34:54.008,00:34:56.010,CO Hope!
00:35:00.181,00:35:01.599,"Yes, sir."
00:35:01.682,00:35:05.895,This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him.
00:35:05.978,00:35:09.607,"Yes, sir! Come over."
00:35:09.690,00:35:13.653,Come over! Fucking move! Let's move. Move. Move.
00:35:48.563,00:35:49.647,Move.
00:35:52.150,00:35:53.609,"-Please, can I have some of the food?"
00:35:56.154,00:35:58.281,"You think you are soldier now, eh?"
00:35:58.364,00:36:01.492,You's nothing. You're not doing nothing here.
00:36:02.243,00:36:05.120,I carry ammunition all day.
00:36:05.205,00:36:08.749,You! Hey! Hey! Move!
00:36:08.833,00:36:09.792,-What? What I do?
00:36:12.962,00:36:14.755,You go back and stand on top of the chair.
00:36:15.923,00:36:18.176,I said go and stand on top of the chair!
00:36:18.259,00:36:21.262,Yeah. And salute!
00:36:30.813,00:36:32.190,"Strika, go."
00:36:52.418,00:36:55.755,"Show me position! Make sure you are clear. Move them, now!"
00:37:02.428,00:37:04.972,You stay together! You stay together!
00:37:05.055,00:37:07.517,Close the space. You're too far.
00:37:08.309,00:37:11.437,Where are you looking at? Where are you looking? Eh?
00:37:11.521,00:37:12.897,Look at your enemy.
00:37:12.980,00:37:14.524,Change!
00:37:19.487,00:37:24.492,"Two-I-C is saying, small-small we are winning this war."
00:37:24.575,00:37:29.163,"And then if you are willing, I can be finding her again."
00:37:30.456,00:37:32.958,"But, only you know."
00:37:39.799,00:37:44.011,and militarily seized power to restore UPC dominance.
00:37:44.094,00:37:48.015,We NDF refuse to recognize this illegitimate government.
00:37:48.098,00:37:49.224,-Who are we?
00:37:56.607,00:38:02.697,"and give them away for small-small dollar in exchange for private pay-offs, they are spit on the constitution!"
00:38:02.780,00:38:04.865,They are spit on your rights!
00:38:04.949,00:38:07.201,They are trying to spit on your future!
00:38:07.285,00:38:08.994,"I say, who is your Supreme Commandant?"
00:38:10.371,00:38:11.289,"-I say, who do you fight for?"
00:38:16.752,00:38:17.587,-Do you hear me?
00:38:22.342,00:38:23.175,-Am I clear?
00:38:25.845,00:38:28.723,You fight and kill anyone who destroys the peace.
00:38:58.168,00:39:01.881,"Offside, offside! That's what I saw. Offside, offside! Offside!"
00:39:10.097,00:39:11.432,"All right, stop it!"
00:39:24.278,00:39:25.655,-How does your Commandant look?
00:39:36.624,00:39:37.833,-Was it fear?
00:39:39.126,00:39:40.085,-Was it war?
00:39:41.045,00:39:43.964,We were defending ourselves.
00:39:44.048,00:39:47.176,We have to get revenge. Huh?
00:39:47.259,00:39:55.184,We have been defending ourselves against the killings and rapings of our own people from the PLF and now from the NRC junta.
00:39:56.101,00:39:59.730,But it has awakened a sleeping beast.
00:39:59.814,00:40:02.149,It has awakened a giant.
00:40:02.232,00:40:09.615,"It has put the weapons of this war back in the hands of you, the young and, therefore, the powerful."
00:40:10.783,00:40:13.619,Young men! Wealth?
00:40:13.703,00:40:17.748,We will not wait to inherit any wealth. Huh?
00:40:17.832,00:40:19.917,We will not wait for them to come and give it to us.
00:40:25.548,00:40:26.841,-We're going to take it from them.
00:40:28.175,00:40:29.051,-Seize it!
00:40:30.219,00:40:41.230,"All of you that have never been listened to before and have seen your family killed, huh, you now have something that stands for you."
00:40:41.313,00:40:43.483,You now have something that stands for you!
00:40:44.734,00:40:46.151,-That is your defense.
00:40:53.701,00:40:54.577,-Victory!
00:40:55.620,00:40:56.621,-We are going to seize it!
00:40:57.580,00:40:58.413,-Victory!
00:41:04.712,00:41:06.839,You are my family.
00:43:35.445,00:43:38.448,and cleansed you.
00:43:38.532,00:43:41.243,"To the enemy, you are invincible."
00:43:42.995,00:43:47.166,But there are rules we must follow...
00:43:47.249,00:43:49.293,to keep the spirits happy...
00:43:52.046,00:43:54.214,to remain pure.
00:44:11.106,00:44:13.693,Enemy never see you again!
00:44:13.776,00:44:17.154,"You are fortified! You are fortified, eh?"
00:44:25.079,00:44:27.372,Now it is time for war. We are warring.
00:44:28.082,00:44:30.584,We did enjoy our camp...
00:44:31.376,00:44:34.588,but from here we are moving.
00:44:34.672,00:44:38.968,Moving forward. We are not to stay here.
00:44:40.094,00:44:43.347,Don't be leaving anything for the enemy to be using.
00:44:43.430,00:44:45.640,We are going to burn it down.
00:44:47.893,00:44:48.936,-Am I clear?
00:44:50.896,00:44:51.856,-You are dismissed.
00:44:58.070,00:44:59.864,Moving out in one hour!
00:45:15.379,00:45:17.714,We are leaving nothing for them to find.
00:45:30.477,00:45:31.771,Burn it down!
00:45:31.854,00:45:33.188,All of it!
00:46:02.009,00:46:03.969,Make sure all the guns are clean.
00:46:06.889,00:46:07.890,Make sure they work.
00:46:10.017,00:46:12.727,"This will keep the spirit up, despite the UN embargo."
00:46:17.607,00:46:21.278,"Being a freedom fighter is discipline, obedience and loyalty."
00:46:22.446,00:46:25.740,"We remain ever loyal to Supreme HQ, sir."
00:46:25.825,00:46:28.368,Standing by for future orders. Over.
00:46:33.332,00:46:35.459,This here. This is the route where we are now.
00:46:35.542,00:46:37.920,"Listen. From here, we must go down."
00:46:38.003,00:46:39.254,And wait by that road there.
00:46:39.338,00:46:40.881,Because I think something is coming across there.
00:47:06.365,00:47:08.367,Come. Come.
00:47:09.994,00:47:10.995,Hey!
00:47:12.746,00:47:17.459,Hey! Why? Where do you go? Come over! Fuck! Fly!
00:48:05.382,00:48:08.468,You keep quiet. Keep very quiet.
00:48:08.552,00:48:11.013,"If even a snake bite your legs, you keep quiet."
00:48:11.096,00:48:12.389,"You get hit, you keep quiet."
00:48:12.472,00:48:15.059,What is the rule number one in ambush?
00:48:15.142,00:48:17.186,"No talking, even if snake is biting you."
00:48:17.269,00:48:19.021,Okay.
00:48:19.104,00:48:22.357,"You talk, enemies come around, we all go die."
00:48:27.988,00:48:29.949,Psst! Psst! Enemies.
00:48:34.744,00:48:38.332,"They are coming. Everybody, be quiet. They are coming."
00:49:27.339,00:49:28.590,Get ready.
00:49:30.842,00:49:32.386,"Go, go, go."
00:49:37.432,00:49:38.767,RPG! RPG!
00:49:56.451,00:49:58.078,Ammo!
00:50:01.665,00:50:02.957,Where's the fucking ammo?
00:50:07.003,00:50:08.505,...fire!
00:50:08.588,00:50:10.549,Cease fire!
00:50:10.632,00:50:12.384,Cease fire!
00:50:13.593,00:50:16.763,Agu! My ammo box!
00:50:16.846,00:50:18.557,You want me to die?
00:50:29.693,00:50:32.071,Search this vehicle. Search all the vehicles.
00:50:34.614,00:50:36.616,I want them disrobed.
00:50:36.700,00:50:40.787,I want this victory mapped. Map them. Map this victory.
00:50:40.870,00:50:41.996,"-Controller, map them!"
00:50:41.996,00:50:43.873,"-Controller, map them! -Yes, sir!"
00:50:43.957,00:50:47.169,"This vehicle, all the bodies, I want them pockets searched."
00:50:48.462,00:50:52.507,All of it! Search them good-good.
00:50:59.306,00:51:00.140,-Pack it up.
00:51:01.057,00:51:02.309,Ah-ha!
00:51:02.392,00:51:04.060,Go and bring me my charge.
00:51:05.270,00:51:06.438,-Sir! I find this.
00:51:06.438,00:51:07.481,-Sir! I find this. -Why don't you open it?
00:51:07.564,00:51:08.982,I find this.
00:51:09.065,00:51:10.275,Oh!
00:51:11.151,00:51:12.444,Uh-huh.
00:51:15.864,00:51:16.906,Yes.
00:51:31.421,00:51:32.714,"Yes, sir!"
00:51:34.883,00:51:36.343,"Agu, you are going to kill this man."
00:51:39.513,00:51:40.764,You are going to kill him today.
00:51:42.932,00:51:46.811,I'm an engineering student from the university in the capital.
00:51:46.895,00:51:51.191,"I'm supposed to be fixing the bridges, -not be a-- -Shut up!"
00:51:52.442,00:51:55.362,Pass me something for this guy.
00:51:56.905,00:51:58.407,"-Nah, that's too big. -It will be cutlass."
00:51:58.490,00:51:59.824,"Yeah, I see."
00:51:59.908,00:52:00.909,Does he have strength for this?
00:52:00.992,00:52:04.829,"Yeah, he is strong. You can do it. Preacher, put him on his ass."
00:52:09.083,00:52:10.377,"Agu, come."
00:52:10.460,00:52:15.131,"So when you are chopping wood, lift up high-high. Up, high."
00:52:15.215,00:52:16.341,Uh-huh!
00:52:16.425,00:52:22.639,"Then when you are ready, you come down so well-well into the flesh."
00:52:22.722,00:52:23.890,-You have chopped melon before? Melon?
00:52:23.890,00:52:24.808,"-You have chopped melon before? Melon? -Please, no."
00:52:24.891,00:52:25.725,"-Well, this is not a melon."
00:52:25.725,00:52:26.560,"-Well, this is not a melon. -Please, no."
00:52:26.643,00:52:30.146,"I said shut your mouth, huh? Shut your mouth."
00:52:31.440,00:52:34.568,You are making it hard. This is hard.
00:52:34.651,00:52:37.404,"It's hard, so you must split him good."
00:52:38.530,00:52:42.451,"Huh? Agu, these are the ones that killed your father."
00:52:43.034,00:52:44.077,Huh?
00:52:44.160,00:52:44.994,-Go on.
00:52:51.626,00:52:53.002,"Agu, go on."
00:52:54.671,00:52:55.797,Agu!
00:53:06.600,00:53:08.184,Where is your mother?
00:53:08.268,00:53:09.644,Please...
00:53:13.690,00:53:15.400,Chop that head!
00:53:24.784,00:53:26.411,"Agu, come on!"
00:53:27.787,00:53:28.955,Ahh!
00:54:19.172,00:54:20.340,That's right.
00:54:20.424,00:54:21.466,Watch his blood.
00:54:21.550,00:54:24.177,That is what you call justice. Hmm.
00:54:30.183,00:54:32.811,It is the worst sin...
00:54:32.894,00:54:37.857,"but I am knowing too, it is the right thing to be doing."
00:54:39.693,00:54:41.486,This will be the Commandant's car.
00:54:41.570,00:54:44.531,Take this fucker out. He is filthy.
00:54:44.614,00:54:47.326,Two-I-C! Two-I-C!
00:54:49.202,00:54:51.455,Give this to my charge. Huh?
00:54:53.081,00:54:54.958,-This will be the Commandant's car.
00:54:54.958,00:54:56.418,"-This will be the Commandant's car. -Yes, sir."
00:55:04.092,00:55:05.093,Uh-huh.
00:55:09.723,00:55:12.100,"Everyone, get ready to move out."
00:55:46.760,00:55:48.553,You got this stuff from where?
00:55:51.473,00:55:52.974,From dead bodies?
00:56:00.649,00:56:04.444,Everybody is calling you Strika. Why?
00:56:10.617,00:56:12.076,Are you liking war?
00:56:14.579,00:56:17.165,"Hey, I'm asking you a question, and you are not talking."
00:56:20.043,00:56:21.795,Are you having family?
00:56:32.472,00:56:35.016,I am thinking about my mom...
00:56:38.394,00:56:39.854,my brother...
00:56:42.398,00:56:44.859,and my little sister.
00:57:03.503,00:57:04.921,Are you stupid?
00:57:08.257,00:57:10.176,Why are you not talking?
00:57:10.259,00:57:11.845,I am asking a question. You are not talking.
00:58:04.188,00:58:07.316,"I got you, Strika."
00:59:28.231,00:59:31.776,"from chicken, cow, fruit and vegetable..."
00:59:31.860,00:59:36.447,"Any kind of fish that you want, we got. The fisherman is bringing it from the sea."
00:59:36.530,00:59:38.617,There's nothing you cannot have there.
00:59:38.700,00:59:47.375,"And the best thing of this place, this town of abundant resources, is the women."
00:59:47.458,00:59:52.421,"Hey, the women are too beautiful there! Too beautiful."
00:59:52.505,00:59:55.925,"Ah! The next thing you know, your soldier will be standing to attention."
00:59:59.053,01:00:07.353,They are having bottoms with specifications so nice that the ground where they're sitting down is also rejoicing.
01:00:07.436,01:00:12.150,And they know... they know how to be treating a man.
01:00:12.233,01:00:16.362,"How to make him feel good, kisses and all that, huh?"
01:00:16.445,01:00:19.365,"Last time I was there, my soldier was hurting."
01:00:19.448,01:00:20.449,"I couldn't stand up, eh!"
01:00:22.702,01:00:27.248,But you will see because you are going there yourselves.
01:00:27.331,01:00:28.332,Hmm?
01:00:28.416,01:00:30.960,"You will see with your own eyes, gentlemen."
01:00:31.044,01:00:32.629,Mmm-hmm.
01:00:40.511,01:00:41.595,-Who is this?
01:00:41.595,01:00:43.765,"-Who is this? -Refugees from the village, sir."
01:00:43.848,01:00:47.476,They said the PLF and the NRC took their village three days ago.
01:00:47.560,01:00:49.896,"They killed most of the town, but they let these ones go."
01:00:49.979,01:00:51.230,Hmm.
01:00:55.276,01:00:58.279,"Well, let us be giving their village back, huh?"
01:01:09.165,01:01:10.416,Look at that.
01:01:10.499,01:01:12.794,They are cutting people's hands.
01:01:14.087,01:01:15.672,Fucking PLF.
01:01:49.413,01:01:51.040,-Two-I-C!
01:01:51.040,01:01:52.500,"-Two-I-C! -Roger, you are loud."
01:01:52.583,01:01:53.835,Report!
01:01:53.918,01:01:57.005,"Uh, we are facing heavy fire, sir. Over."
01:01:57.088,01:01:58.297,Can you take the bridge?
01:01:58.381,01:02:03.177,"It's very difficult, sir. Men are fighting bravely, but I don't know if we can hold too much longer. Over."
01:02:05.930,01:02:07.473,Some of our men are injured.
01:02:07.556,01:02:11.435,"The men's spirits are low. Sir, do you copy?"
01:02:11.895,01:02:12.729,-Sir?
01:02:12.729,01:02:14.814,-Sir? -Can you take the bridge?
01:02:14.898,01:02:19.235,"Copy, sir. We will reapply pressure and push for the bridge. Over."
01:02:19.318,01:02:20.611,Take the bridge!
01:02:20.694,01:02:22.280,-That is your task! Mortar.
01:02:22.280,01:02:23.114,"-That is your task! Mortar. -Yes, sir!"
01:02:23.197,01:02:24.657,-Your ammo now!
01:02:24.657,01:02:26.826,"-Your ammo now! -Ammunition ready, sir!"
01:02:26.910,01:02:28.244,Stand by!
01:02:38.587,01:02:40.339,Agu and Strika.
01:02:40.423,01:02:41.590,"Yes, sir!"
01:02:41.674,01:02:47.013,"See this thing, huh? This is a very special device."
01:02:47.096,01:02:52.268,We can be seeing the enemy even when the enemy is hiding.
01:02:52.351,01:02:54.520,Come.
01:02:54.603,01:02:56.397,"Wait, Strika."
01:02:59.483,01:03:04.488,"Ah! There you go. See our guys. Look, we are taking them."
01:03:06.324,01:03:08.117,You see?
01:03:11.162,01:03:12.288,Fire!
01:03:21.881,01:03:22.715,-See that?
01:03:22.715,01:03:23.632,-See that? -Yeah.
01:03:23.716,01:03:26.260,That is magic. Huh?
01:03:29.097,01:03:31.140,We want to take that bridge.
01:03:32.016,01:03:34.477,Now we are going to take that bridge.
01:03:38.314,01:03:39.773,-Formation!
01:03:49.742,01:03:52.328,Who wants to fight? Uh-huh.
01:03:53.329,01:03:55.623,I'm only taking the brave!
01:03:55.706,01:03:58.042,I'm not taking the scared.
01:03:59.460,01:04:03.381,I'm not taking no girls.
01:04:03.464,01:04:04.673,-Are you ready to fight?
01:04:05.591,01:04:06.467,-Are you ready to fight?
01:04:08.386,01:04:09.512,-You want to take that bridge?
01:04:10.847,01:04:12.098,-We're gonna take that fucking bridge?
01:05:21.667,01:05:22.668,Fucking PLF!
01:05:23.252,01:05:25.546,Fucking PLF!
01:05:28.716,01:05:29.592,-No retreat!
01:05:30.759,01:05:32.636,We're moving!
01:05:32.720,01:05:34.222,We're moving!
01:05:36.557,01:05:38.642,We're moving!
01:05:40.769,01:05:42.438,They are nothing! Nothing!
01:07:28.211,01:07:29.878,We shall go back to dust.
01:07:34.842,01:07:37.886,May their soul rest in peace. Amen.
01:07:43.684,01:07:49.732,They are sweet like sugarcane and rotten like palm wine.
01:07:49.815,01:07:55.904,"And when they stay in the sun, they are growing plump like brown mangoes."
01:08:32.816,01:08:37.029,"When you accomplish that, I will promulgate an order making you Brigadier General."
01:08:37.113,01:08:40.324,You'll be a general before we finally seize the capital city.
01:08:42.326,01:08:45.746,"But I promise you, it's mission possible. Over."
01:08:47.581,01:08:49.167,I'll be speaking to a general.
01:08:49.250,01:08:52.128,And how is your Two-I-C performing? Over.
01:08:52.211,01:08:55.047,"Two-I-C? Sorry, sir. What do you mean Two-I-C?"
01:08:56.882,01:08:59.760,"Well, Two-I-C is a formidable soldier."
01:08:59.843,01:09:01.137,Over.
01:09:03.514,01:09:04.557,"Yes, sir."
01:09:06.767,01:09:08.436,and bring us closer to victory.
01:09:14.024,01:09:15.108,"-Yes, sir."
01:09:15.108,01:09:16.610,"-Yes, sir. -Earn it. Over and out."
01:09:16.694,01:09:18.321,Over and out.
01:09:19.988,01:09:22.074,"-Agu, you fought well today."
01:09:22.074,01:09:23.492,"-Agu, you fought well today. -Thank you, sir."
01:09:24.493,01:09:27.413,A-ha! What is this?
01:09:28.872,01:09:30.040,Ah!
01:09:31.584,01:09:33.336,"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow."
01:09:36.380,01:09:39.842,"Agu, you are wanting to be knowing how to be leading?"
01:09:39.925,01:09:42.386,"-I am happy to be following you, sir."
01:09:42.386,01:09:48.226,"-I am happy to be following you, sir. -That is good, because there is no learning how to be leading."
01:09:48.309,01:09:54.732,"Some people are born to be leaders, others are born to be followers, and others are just waiting to be dying."
01:09:54.815,01:09:56.525,"-I'm a good follower, sir."
01:09:56.525,01:09:58.068,"-I'm a good follower, sir. -Agu, you are different."
01:09:58.151,01:10:00.904,You are reminding me of when I was a small boy.
01:10:00.988,01:10:04.742,That is how I know you are going to be a leader.
01:10:05.909,01:10:12.082,"You see, even the best leader sometimes he must be knowing how to be a follower."
01:10:13.209,01:10:15.127,"Ah, even me."
01:10:15.211,01:10:21.425,"I am following the Supreme Commandant, even if I am not agreeing."
01:10:22.760,01:10:23.886,Huh?
01:10:23.969,01:10:27.097,"Yes, sir. I'm a good follower."
01:10:29.433,01:10:31.394,You are seeing this place?
01:10:32.102,01:10:35.523,The Commandant is saying we must take this.
01:10:35.606,01:10:36.732,That it is important.
01:10:36.815,01:10:41.069,"So, hmm, if it is important to him, it is important to me."
01:10:44.072,01:10:47.117,"Because if we get that, then we can go to Taro."
01:10:55.959,01:10:58.254,"-That is where your mother is, eh?"
01:10:58.254,01:11:00.088,"-That is where your mother is, eh? -She is in the capital."
01:11:04.760,01:11:10.015,"After we've been greeted by Dada Goodblood, we'll be taking the capital certainly."
01:11:14.312,01:11:16.439,Come.
01:11:22.778,01:11:25.406,This one has special juju.
01:11:25.489,01:11:26.699,"Thank you, sir."
01:11:26.782,01:11:34.582,"You see, I've been wanting to help you more than the others, Agu, but you cannot be telling the others how I'm helping you like this."
01:11:34.665,01:11:36.750,It'll have to be our secret.
01:11:37.585,01:11:39.169,-You are knowing how to keep secret?
01:11:39.169,01:11:40.003,"-You are knowing how to keep secret? -Yes, sir."
01:11:40.087,01:11:41.714,"-Well, be saying it."
01:11:41.714,01:11:44.091,"-Well, be saying it. -I can be keeping this secret, sir."
01:11:55.353,01:11:58.897,"I'm not punishing you, Agu. Mmm?"
01:11:59.940,01:12:02.150,But I do care for you.
01:12:21.086,01:12:22.254,Aye.
01:12:24.715,01:12:26.299,"Agu, kneel down."
01:12:34.016,01:12:39.104,Be doing this thing... for me.
01:13:36.412,01:13:38.997,"Move, move to your left."
01:13:45.671,01:13:47.047,"-Keep going. -Move, move."
01:13:56.474,01:13:58.183,Agu?
01:13:58.266,01:14:01.770,I don't want that I call you and you just stand there. Agu?
01:14:03.897,01:14:05.315,"Come here, I'll give you some brown-brown."
01:14:05.398,01:14:08.360,"It'll cure everything for you, eh."
01:14:08.944,01:14:11.780,"Hey, I didn't call you to stand there."
01:14:14.950,01:14:16.034,Hmm?
01:14:17.536,01:14:21.665,"My boy, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?"
01:14:22.916,01:14:25.210,"Come here, I'll give you some morale booster."
01:14:25.293,01:14:28.672,"I think I'll give you that brown-brown, so..."
01:14:28.756,01:14:32.801,"Morale booster, you know. Come, come. Here."
01:14:35.763,01:14:37.473,"Yeah, that my boy."
01:14:37.556,01:14:40.308,"Yeah. Morale booster, eh?"
01:14:40.392,01:14:42.520,Make you strong.
01:14:42.603,01:14:44.396,More protection.
01:14:50.486,01:14:52.655,They are the enemy.
01:14:52.738,01:14:56.408,They are the farmers that have fed the enemy.
01:14:58.368,01:14:59.828,...have been feeding babies.
01:15:05.208,01:15:08.504,The collaborators and the traitors.
01:15:09.337,01:15:11.840,Our people's blood has been flowing for years.
01:15:11.924,01:15:15.343,That's why it is time for their blood to flow.
01:15:18.764,01:15:24.645,"We'll spare nobody, because they are all enemy, all of them!"
01:15:26.689,01:15:27.773,Let us pray.
01:15:30.483,01:15:32.528,"God, let us pray."
01:15:34.071,01:15:37.658,He is guiding us with what we are about to be doing.
01:15:37.741,01:15:39.242,He is helping us.
01:15:40.953,01:15:43.080,Let us fulfill your justice.
01:15:45.624,01:15:47.417,Give us the strength!
01:15:49.419,01:15:52.505,"God, we will be sacrificing our blood!"
01:15:52.590,01:15:55.676,That is why we must spare nobody!
01:15:55.759,01:15:58.554,We will spare nobody!
01:15:58.637,01:16:00.138,Nothing will hurt us.
01:16:03.976,01:16:08.063,Because we are invincible. We are invincible!
01:16:21.827,01:16:22.661,-Who are we?
01:16:50.689,01:16:51.815,-Kill them all!
01:17:01.867,01:17:04.286,"Come on, move, NDF! Move, move! Move!"
01:17:28.185,01:17:29.061,"-I say, how the Commandant look?"
01:17:31.604,01:17:32.439,"-I say, how the Commandant look?"
01:17:33.356,01:17:34.191,-NDF! NDF!
01:17:50.332,01:17:53.293,Shoot them! Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
01:17:59.216,01:18:01.384,Commandant! Sir!
01:18:01.468,01:18:03.345,Leave this one under my charge.
01:18:03.428,01:18:05.347,I will be training him to be a warrior.
01:18:05.430,01:18:06.932,"-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:07.015,01:18:08.100,"-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:08.183,01:18:09.392,"-Yes, sir! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:09.476,01:18:10.853,"-Yes, sir! -Again!"
01:18:10.936,01:18:11.937,"-Yes, sir! -Again!"
01:18:12.020,01:18:13.271,"-Yes, sir! Yes, sir!"
01:18:13.271,01:18:14.272,"-Yes, sir! Yes, sir! -Again!"
01:18:14.356,01:18:15.523,"-Again! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:15.607,01:18:16.734,"-Again! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:16.817,01:18:18.068,"-Again! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:18.151,01:18:19.527,"-Again! -Yes, sir!"
01:18:19.611,01:18:20.570,-Again!
01:18:20.570,01:18:21.446,"-Again! -Yes, sir!"
01:19:25.093,01:19:26.762,Fucking out! Fucking out! Out!
01:19:26.845,01:19:32.059,"Fucking out! Out! Get up! Get up, fuck! Get up! Up!"
01:19:46.531,01:19:48.200,You know her?
01:20:50.846,01:20:53.056,Oh! Why? Shit!
01:20:55.558,01:20:57.394,What the fuck is that?
01:20:58.353,01:21:02.149,"You didn't fucking boy, eh? You didn't fucking, boy."
01:21:38.643,01:21:43.523,"Fuck him up, eh? Fuck you up. Fuck you up."
01:22:14.972,01:22:17.057,Now it is your turn to eat.
01:22:21.144,01:22:22.812,Load the vehicles.
01:22:24.564,01:22:26.566,He is summoning us.
01:22:30.570,01:22:32.405,Did he state a reason?
01:22:33.573,01:22:35.117,Isn't it clear?
01:22:39.121,01:22:40.038,-Are we going to Taro?
01:22:41.999,01:22:44.251,This guy!
01:22:44.334,01:22:46.169,You can't see my ears?
01:22:49.464,01:22:51.216,What is happening to this one?
01:22:51.299,01:22:53.843,A piece of RPG is hitting his temple.
01:23:01.018,01:23:02.060,Leave one of them alive.
01:23:02.144,01:23:05.813,Send him up north to the next village and then the next village after that.
01:23:05.897,01:23:08.733,Tell them that we are coming. It's only the beginning.
01:23:09.901,01:23:11.069,"-Tripod! -Yes, sir."
01:23:11.153,01:23:15.907,Take note and act accordingly. Strika and Agu are now part of my squad.
01:23:15.991,01:23:17.784,Mountain View. Iron Jacket. Over.
01:23:24.832,01:23:25.667,-Get in!
01:23:44.561,01:23:45.687,-Tripod!
01:23:45.687,01:23:46.521,"-Tripod! -Yes, sir!"
01:23:46.604,01:23:48.273,Guns up!
01:24:20.263,01:24:21.973,Who is your commander?
01:24:23.933,01:24:26.811,What kind of welcome is this?
01:24:26.894,01:24:29.856,"Sorry, sir. You, get in that car. Take them to HQ."
01:24:29.939,01:24:31.983,Clear the way!
01:24:32.067,01:24:33.401,Clear the fuckin' way!
01:24:37.489,01:24:39.866,Right this way. Right this way.
01:24:43.370,01:24:44.662,Fuck you!
01:25:33.670,01:25:35.672,"-Commandant, welcome."
01:25:35.672,01:25:36.714,"-Commandant, welcome. -Hello, Deputy."
01:25:38.716,01:25:42.179,Weapons are not allowed in here. So you place them here.
01:25:42.262,01:25:44.264,"Leave your weapons, boys. Soldiers."
01:25:51.020,01:25:53.981,You wait here. Here. Have a seat.
01:25:54.065,01:25:55.275,And you will bring us water?
01:26:12.417,01:26:14.502,Goodblood will see you now.
01:26:15.253,01:26:16.254,Him.
01:26:41.112,01:26:43.155,Have a seat here.
01:26:57.837,01:27:09.098,Goodblood says this is a token of appreciation-- I'm sorry. The Supreme Commander is so very upset to keep you waiting.
01:27:09.181,01:27:11.309,"Please, will you follow me?"
01:27:15.272,01:27:16.648,Please sit.
01:27:21.361,01:27:22.737,-What is this?
01:27:22.737,01:27:23.946,-What is this? -He'll be with you shortly.
01:27:24.030,01:27:26.115,Huh? Where is the water?
01:27:26.198,01:27:28.243,"Bring them water, quickly!"
01:28:08.616,01:28:09.992,Commandant.
01:28:12.704,01:28:13.746,Commandant?
01:28:15.665,01:28:16.958,Commandant.
01:28:19.502,01:28:20.962,I trust you rested well.
01:28:21.879,01:28:27.969,I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your battalion this morning.
01:28:43.234,01:28:44.652,Stand there.
01:28:54.704,01:28:55.705,Attention!
01:29:12.555,01:29:14.557,Commandant.
01:29:14.641,01:29:16.559,"Supreme Commander, sir."
01:29:19.562,01:29:20.855,"At ease, gentlemen."
01:29:20.938,01:29:22.774,At ease.
01:29:32.575,01:29:34.994,It looks like your family has grown.
01:29:35.077,01:29:38.915,"They must eat while we talk, unless you are hungry, too."
01:29:38.998,01:29:42.585,"I'm not hungry. Two-I-C, take them and go and eat."
01:29:42.669,01:29:45.379,"Two-I-C, you stay."
01:29:45.463,01:29:46.589,Come.
01:29:55.598,01:29:57.183,I love food.
01:30:04.315,01:30:05.775,What is this?
01:30:08.319,01:30:10.362,You have made me wait.
01:30:11.614,01:30:15.452,You are leading me to believe we are changing objectives.
01:30:15.535,01:30:18.412,Are we not taking the capital anymore?
01:30:18.496,01:30:22.625,"Chief, to protect our people, the time is now."
01:30:22.709,01:30:27.880,"If we have the momentum and we have the power, why wait?"
01:30:27.964,01:30:33.344,"You are not the political voice of this movement, Commandant. I am."
01:30:33.427,01:30:37.765,Protecting our people remains the priority.
01:30:37.849,01:30:41.894,"But as you know, the world is becoming aware of this war now."
01:30:42.812,01:30:45.815,No one will escape judgment when it is over.
01:30:47.149,01:30:50.778,And the decisions we make have far deeper consequences.
01:30:50.862,01:30:55.492,And what decisions have you made... for my battalion?
01:30:58.870,01:31:00.622,Are you not making me general?
01:31:00.705,01:31:02.749,"No, I am not."
01:31:02.832,01:31:06.293,"I'm giving your battalion to Two-I-C, Commandant."
01:31:06.377,01:31:07.712,That is why I brought you here.
01:31:07.795,01:31:13.801,"And you, I will promote to Deputy Chief of Security, effective immediately."
01:31:13.885,01:31:17.639,I hope you accept and act accordingly.
01:31:19.181,01:31:26.022,"Thank you, sir. I promise to fulfill my duty to the fullest-- Get out!"
01:31:29.483,01:31:30.652,Soldiers.
01:31:42.705,01:31:47.334,"This, my battalion... that I have made with my own hands."
01:31:47.418,01:31:49.003,I'm their father!
01:31:49.086,01:31:54.967,"Your battalion is my battalion, Commandant, as are hundreds of others across this nation."
01:31:55.885,01:32:01.348,"I want the ceremony of changeover tomorrow, so that Two-I-C can take the battalion back out for battle."
01:32:01.432,01:32:08.731,"As you know, and with thanks to you, we have the NRC on their heels with the help and support of the UN and ECOMOD."
01:32:08.815,01:32:12.026,It has now become a battle for public image.
01:32:13.736,01:32:16.155,And what of my payment? Hmm?
01:32:16.238,01:32:17.574,What of my payment?
01:32:17.657,01:32:22.494,What share of the resources will I be seeing?
01:32:23.037,01:32:25.957,Do not forget you are a soldier.
01:32:26.540,01:32:29.085,Your most important duty is obedience.
01:32:29.168,01:32:30.628,Your first duty is obedience.
01:32:30.712,01:32:32.504,Your second duty is obedience.
01:32:32.589,01:32:35.299,Your third duty is obedience. Everything is obedience.
01:32:35.382,01:32:39.511,"Without obedience, you have nothing."
01:32:46.644,01:32:48.896,I have not forgotten myself.
01:32:50.773,01:32:52.984,You are right.
01:32:53.067,01:32:56.487,I'm a soldier...
01:32:56.570,01:32:59.115,not a politician.
01:33:01.492,01:33:06.205,I will have one more night... with my men.
01:33:10.292,01:33:11.961,Dada Goodblood.
01:33:14.881,01:33:15.882,-Move out!
01:33:16.883,01:33:17.717,-Move out!
01:33:17.717,01:33:18.926,-Move out! -Move out!
01:33:19.010,01:33:20.594,Let's go.
01:33:27.309,01:33:28.645,-Tripod.
01:33:28.645,01:33:29.561,"-Tripod. -Yes, sir."
01:33:29.646,01:33:33.024,Assemble the COs and the troops and bivouac outside of town.
01:33:33.107,01:33:36.318,I'm taking Two-I-C and the boys to all celebrate tonight.
01:33:36.402,01:33:37.528,"Yes, sir."
01:33:37.611,01:33:39.321,Where are we going?
01:33:41.365,01:33:43.409,You will see.
01:33:43.492,01:33:45.327,You will like it.
01:33:45.411,01:33:49.373,"And if you and Strika are my bodyguards, and I am going, then you are also going."
01:33:49.456,01:33:51.333,Are you hearing me?
01:34:15.983,01:34:17.694,Ha! So you come!
01:34:17.777,01:34:22.573,-Ha! Commandant! Commandant!
01:34:30.790,01:34:34.210,Bring beer. Bring soda. Bring whatever you have.
01:34:36.420,01:34:38.672,"Hurry, hurry!"
01:34:38.756,01:34:42.468,Can't you see we have guests? Hurry!
01:34:47.181,01:34:48.933,The beer is warm.
01:34:49.934,01:34:51.435,How is the beer warm?
01:34:51.518,01:34:52.979,-No ice.
01:34:56.607,01:34:58.359,But I am seeing light.
01:34:59.986,01:35:05.783,"Oh! Well, doesn't matter because we will drink it whether it's hot or it's cold."
01:35:05.867,01:35:08.077,Go on. Share it.
01:35:08.160,01:35:10.204,"Commandant, permission to be dismissed."
01:35:10.287,01:35:13.707,I need to be checking on the others-- Negative!
01:35:15.877,01:35:19.171,You will be staying here so we can celebrate you.
01:35:19.255,01:35:27.263,"In fact, Mama, I want you to bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Commandant."
01:35:27.346,01:35:28.680,-Who is your Commandant?
01:35:28.680,01:35:29.515,"-Who is your Commandant? -You, sir!"
01:35:34.896,01:35:37.523,No problem.
01:35:39.901,01:35:41.610,No problem.
01:35:41.693,01:35:44.571,"Hey, Mama, this one has fresh papaya."
01:35:46.282,01:35:47.825,Leave this one now.
01:35:47.909,01:35:51.745,"If it is women you wanting, I get plenty from backyard."
01:35:51.829,01:35:54.999,Just bring me my own. You know my specifications.
01:35:55.082,01:35:56.250,I know! I know!
01:35:56.333,01:35:58.252,"Aunty, bring us some chips."
01:35:58.335,01:35:59.711,Ah.
01:35:59.796,01:36:02.339,See this little yeah-yeah boy born yesterday.
01:36:05.551,01:36:06.803,-Where are the girls?
01:36:09.721,01:36:14.894,"We've got enough girls for the men, but no more for the little boys."
01:36:17.396,01:36:19.816,Leave your weapons with Strika.
01:36:35.789,01:36:38.000,Look at you. Look at you.
01:36:46.342,01:36:48.510,Strika.
01:36:50.888,01:36:55.392,Don't be watching your Commandant because you can't have what I'm having.
01:37:15.246,01:37:17.289,Go stand by the waterfall.
01:38:14.305,01:38:16.432,What happened? Huh?
01:38:18.100,01:38:19.101,What happened?
01:38:21.228,01:38:22.229,You did this.
01:38:22.313,01:38:24.731,What happened to my man? What happened here?
01:38:24.815,01:38:26.817,I was just playing with his gun and it just went off.
01:38:26.900,01:38:28.444,-I don't know what happened. I'm sorry.
01:38:29.987,01:38:32.739,"-You did this. -Relax, relax, relax, relax!"
01:38:32.823,01:38:34.366,You did this! You did this!
01:38:36.410,01:38:37.619,"-You thought you were shooting me! -No, no, no!"
01:38:37.703,01:38:38.870,-You thought it was me?
01:38:38.870,01:38:39.871,-You thought it was me? -I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry.
01:38:39.956,01:38:41.540,Were you trying to kill me and you kill my soldier?
01:38:41.623,01:38:50.382,It was an accident! No! Not me-- -Let's go. Let's go! Hey! -Move!
01:38:50.466,01:38:52.843,Pick him up! Pick him up! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
01:38:52.926,01:38:54.761,Pick him up! I want you to take all their women!
01:39:05.106,01:39:06.857,anyone have eyes on Iron Jacket?
01:39:06.940,01:39:10.736,All call signs report visual of Iron Jacket. Over.
01:39:20.371,01:39:24.083,Any knowledge on the location or movement of Iron Jacket? Over.
01:39:28.379,01:39:31.132,"I repeat, no visual of Iron Jacket. Over."
01:39:36.470,01:39:38.430,Nothing to report. Over.
01:39:41.558,01:39:46.272,"Report, Iron Jacket moved out from our checkpoint yesterday. Over."
01:39:50.234,01:39:52.361,Iron Jacket moved through your sector? Over.
01:40:00.494,01:40:04.331,Iron Jacket battalion moved out with orders for battle. Over.
01:40:09.002,01:40:12.173,This was all for nothing.
01:40:26.895,01:40:28.397,"-Iron Jacket, where are you? -Yes, sir."
01:40:33.694,01:40:49.626,"Iron Jacket, you are disobeying a direct-- Agu, these are very dangerous times."
01:40:50.544,01:40:53.130,Never know who you could be trusting.
01:40:53.214,01:40:54.298,Huh?
01:40:55.341,01:40:59.720,That is why it is good to always sleep one eye open.
01:41:00.804,01:41:03.599,That is why I have you and I have Strika.
01:41:08.479,01:41:11.273,"Agu, sometimes I'm feeling sorry for you."
01:41:13.692,01:41:15.236,Sometimes I am.
01:41:37.299,01:41:41.262,"Our Father, today we lost our fellow soldier."
01:41:41.345,01:41:44.640,Guide him forever and ever. Amen.
01:41:50.812,01:41:51.647,"-Yes, sir!"
01:41:55.066,01:41:58.111,This was not God's work.
01:41:58.195,01:41:59.821,This was man.
01:42:00.406,01:42:03.033,Supreme Commandant was our friend.
01:42:03.534,01:42:05.994,Now he's our enemy.
01:42:06.077,01:42:10.916,"But we are not fearing change, for we are strong!"
01:42:14.211,01:42:18.965,That is why we should be taking our own territory...
01:42:20.551,01:42:23.136,and filling our own pockets.
01:42:24.971,01:42:28.725,"Gentlemen, move out."
01:42:41.029,01:42:43.990,We are leaving him.
01:42:44.074,01:42:49.705,"And I am thinking, The only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying."
01:43:58.357,01:44:01.735,Every person I am knowing is dying.
01:44:01.818,01:44:09.660,"And I am thinking, If this war is ever ending, I cannot be going back to doing child things."
01:44:18.502,01:44:21.588,Bullet is just eating everything.
01:44:23.840,01:44:27.886,"Leaves, trees, ground, person."
01:44:31.432,01:44:34.393,Just making person to bleed everywhere.
01:44:39.815,01:44:45.195,We are just like wild animals now with no place to be going.
01:44:50.742,01:44:55.414,"Sun, why are you shining on this world?"
01:44:57.165,01:45:05.090,"I am wanting to catch you in my hands, to squeeze you until you cannot shine no more."
01:45:07.175,01:45:15.601,"That way, everything is always dark and nobody's ever having to see all the terrible things that are happening here."
01:45:59.478,01:46:01.438,Preacher!
01:46:05.401,01:46:06.485,Sir.
01:46:14.868,01:46:16.369,"Thank you, sir."
01:46:42.103,01:46:44.189,Strika! Strika! Strika!
01:46:44.898,01:46:47.568,Stand up and let's go! We are going.
01:46:49.319,01:46:51.029,Let's go!
01:46:52.531,01:46:54.032,Strika!
01:46:55.408,01:46:57.118,Stand up and let's go!
01:46:59.788,01:47:01.707,What is wrong with you?
01:48:08.481,01:48:13.319,"I am wanting to say to Strika, I am tired, too."
01:48:15.572,01:48:21.036,"I am tired, and so the words are not coming out of my mouth."
01:48:52.609,01:48:53.819,Strika?
01:48:56.154,01:48:57.781,Do you hear that?
01:48:59.365,01:49:01.702,"A song, just like my mother sang."
01:49:05.080,01:49:06.289,Strika?
01:49:08.249,01:49:09.459,Strika?
01:49:11.753,01:49:12.963,Strika.
01:49:21.638,01:49:24.099,Strika! Strika!
01:49:25.892,01:49:27.102,Strika!
01:49:30.063,01:49:31.272,Strika!
01:49:42.075,01:49:43.660,Someone help us.
01:49:50.291,01:49:51.501,Strika!
01:49:54.713,01:49:56.131,Strika!
01:49:58.216,01:49:59.425,Strika!
01:51:29.808,01:51:33.311,Agu. Agu. Agu!
01:51:33.394,01:51:34.520,Sir?
01:51:34.604,01:51:37.523,Go get me some fucking bullets to be shooting right now. Move!
01:51:38.900,01:51:40.026,Move!
01:52:25.822,01:52:30.660,I can only be talking to you now because God is not listening.
01:52:35.456,01:52:41.754,"Your song is making my body to move, and I am not having to think anymore."
01:52:47.677,01:52:56.352,"Not about Strika, not about this war, not about any of the things that are jumping into my head."
01:53:01.482,01:53:10.116,I am wanting to lie down on the warm ground with my eyes closed and the smell of mud in my nose.
01:54:09.467,01:54:11.052,"Commandant, sir."
01:54:12.345,01:54:14.264,We are out from bullet.
01:54:19.477,01:54:22.813,It wasn't supposed to be the way that it has turned out to be.
01:54:24.065,01:54:27.193,Everybody betrays you eventually.
01:54:29.070,01:54:32.866,"But you, I will always protect you, Agu, because you are my son..."
01:54:34.868,01:54:37.703,and a son always protects a father.
01:54:42.208,01:54:45.503,"Commandant, I want to talk to you, sir."
01:54:45.586,01:54:47.505,What is all this?
01:54:47.588,01:54:48.965,"We are leaving, sir."
01:54:52.302,01:54:55.263,Who and who is leaving?
01:54:56.973,01:54:59.725,"Two-I-C, go back to your post."
01:55:00.936,01:55:04.647,"No, sir. We are going, sir."
01:55:04.730,01:55:06.900,"You are the only one standing in front of me, stupid."
01:55:07.733,01:55:13.323,"I am going, sir. No bullets. What am I going to use to shoot my enemy?"
01:55:13.990,01:55:15.825,We have been here for months now.
01:55:15.909,01:55:18.078,"Gold miners, no gold."
01:55:18.161,01:55:21.747,"No money, no food, no water."
01:55:21.831,01:55:23.458,"It madness, Commandant."
01:55:24.209,01:55:26.544,People sick here and dying every day.
01:55:27.963,01:55:30.756,"It madness, Commander."
01:55:30.840,01:55:32.550,Who want to stay here and die?
01:55:35.220,01:55:37.055,Who want to stay here and die?
01:55:37.138,01:55:38.556,"I want to go, sir!"
01:55:38.639,01:55:40.266,"Me, too. I want to go, sir!"
01:55:42.978,01:55:44.020,"-Nobody want to stay here, sir!"
01:55:44.020,01:55:45.855,"-Nobody want to stay here, sir! -We want to go, sir."
01:55:46.481,01:55:48.024,Then come and tell him how you feel.
01:55:49.525,01:55:53.738,Come and tell him how much we are suffering here.
01:55:55.365,01:55:58.784,"Come! Everybody, come."
01:55:58.868,01:56:01.579,"So, you... you are the big man now, huh?"
01:56:02.747,01:56:03.957,Hmm?
01:56:04.040,01:56:06.209,Where will you be going? Huh?
01:56:06.292,01:56:09.295,Will you surrender to the other NDF camp?
01:56:09.379,01:56:12.048,No. They will eat you.
01:56:13.591,01:56:16.386,And what of ECOMOD? Huh?
01:56:16.469,01:56:19.180,"That might be better, but what next?"
01:56:19.264,01:56:21.182,Jail?
01:56:21.266,01:56:23.184,War crimes?
01:56:23.268,01:56:24.352,Huh?
01:56:26.187,01:56:31.484,You think you can just go and do what you want in peace?
01:56:31.567,01:56:38.491,You will go back to your village and your family will not associate themselves with you.
01:56:38.574,01:56:40.410,Huh? You will be nothing.
01:56:40.493,01:56:44.747,"You and your uneducated, poor mind, you'll be nothing."
01:56:44.830,01:56:48.334,Nobody will care for you. Huh?
01:56:48.418,01:56:50.753,Look at you.
01:56:50.836,01:57:05.601,"And you will wake up and you will rise and see the sunrise and see the sunset, and you can just wait all day, all day, with thousands of men just like you, waiting for somebody to give you a job."
01:57:05.685,01:57:06.727,Huh?
01:57:07.728,01:57:10.023,That is what you want to go and do?
01:57:13.651,01:57:16.654,You have nothing! No future!
01:57:16.737,01:57:17.905,I am your future.
01:57:20.658,01:57:21.992,What?
01:57:27.207,01:57:30.376,How are you going to shoot me if you don't have bullets?
01:57:32.753,01:57:35.423,"And you, Agu?"
01:57:35.506,01:57:37.425,You wanna kill Commandant?
01:57:38.134,01:57:41.221,"Hey, Agu, I want you to kill Commandant. Come."
01:57:41.304,01:57:42.138,-Push it.
01:57:43.098,01:57:45.933,"Come, Agu, come. Put it here. Here!"
01:57:46.016,01:57:47.227,A-ha! A-ha!
01:57:48.144,01:57:49.437,Wanna kill Commandant?
01:57:51.981,01:57:53.441,Do it.
01:57:56.194,01:57:57.987,You wanna surrender?
01:57:58.071,01:57:59.239,Huh?
01:57:59.322,01:58:01.282,You wanna surrender?
01:58:08.081,01:58:09.165,Yes.
01:58:15.963,01:58:17.257,"Hey, Agu."
01:58:20.510,01:58:21.969,Just get out.
01:58:24.764,01:58:33.189,"Just remember, when you are all poor and hungry you'll remember me!"
01:58:34.149,01:58:37.067,You'll remember your Commandant.
01:58:40.070,01:58:41.864,"Come on. Everybody, let's move!"
01:58:43.783,01:58:48.037,And know that I will be calling for you one day.
01:58:50.290,01:58:53.959,Go and drink gunpowder tea and playing draughts.
01:58:54.043,01:58:58.131,"No, no, no. You remember me. You remember your Commandant."
01:58:58.214,01:59:00.216,"You're gonna say, Yeah!"
01:59:03.844,01:59:06.889,"Remember, I will call for you again..."
01:59:06.972,01:59:09.892,and you'll come.
01:59:11.977,01:59:13.271,Remember.
01:59:23.198,01:59:27.577,They will just lock you up in jail! You are stupid!
01:59:28.494,01:59:33.333,"When the time come back, the other ones, they'll come eat you."
01:59:36.877,01:59:39.547,"Agu, you stay here because they don't..."
02:00:24.425,02:00:25.635,-Who are you?
02:00:28.888,02:00:31.807,Raise up your arms! All weapons in the air!
02:00:31.891,02:00:32.892,All of you!
02:00:34.143,02:00:36.521,Now turn and face the bush!
02:00:36.604,02:00:40.024,Don't look at my face! Put your weapons on the ground!
02:00:40.107,02:00:43.361,Step back. Step back!
02:00:43.444,02:00:45.488,And turn around!
02:00:45.571,02:00:47.240,"I said, turn around!"
02:00:47.323,02:00:48.658,"All right, hands up!"
02:00:48.741,02:00:51.244,Hands up! Sit on the floor!
02:00:59.252,02:01:01.379,Put your hands on your head!
02:01:06.175,02:01:08.010,Don't look at my face!
02:03:58.013,02:03:59.139,Hmm?
02:04:01.266,02:04:04.103,I know things are hard.
02:04:04.729,02:04:06.772,"I've been there, remember?"
02:04:08.441,02:04:11.151,We are all here to help you.
02:04:12.069,02:04:13.946,Okay?
02:04:18.283,02:04:21.537,but I'm staying here for a long time.
02:04:23.330,02:04:28.669,"Some week, some month, I am not knowing."
02:04:30.921,02:04:34.216,All I am knowing is how it is feeling here.
02:04:36.761,02:04:42.016,I am knowing the sound of people screaming and the smell of dead bodies...
02:04:43.476,02:04:48.731,and I am knowing the feeling of the brown-brown and djamba in my blood.
02:04:58.949,02:05:00.242,This is your home!
02:05:00.325,02:05:02.745,"No, they are giving us poison there!"
02:05:08.876,02:05:13.714,"He's saying, The war is not over, and they are needing fighters like us."
02:05:13.798,02:05:16.926,We need money for here. We need money. Eh?
02:05:17.009,02:05:19.053,You can't stay here without money.
02:05:19.845,02:05:24.642,"And we're soldiers, fighting is what we know."
02:05:24.725,02:05:26.769,That's what we should do.
02:05:26.852,02:05:29.564,Have you forgotten? We have food to eat.
02:05:29.647,02:05:31.273,-We have shelter. -Shh!
02:05:34.401,02:05:37.279,"-And even we learn, we learn."
02:05:37.279,02:05:38.155,"-And even we learn, we learn. -Yeah."
02:05:39.615,02:05:42.785,"You NRC soldier, with the talk, you talk too much."
02:05:44.369,02:05:47.331,"Agu, I can't stay here. I'm leaving."
02:05:47.414,02:05:49.166,-Preacher!
02:05:49.166,02:05:50.042,-Preacher! -Let's go!
02:05:50.960,02:05:54.088,"Randy, don't go into the bush again."
02:05:56.298,02:05:57.758,Don't follow Preacher.
02:05:57.842,02:06:00.177,Randy!
02:06:13.983,02:06:16.902,I don't like when you look into my eyes.
02:06:16.986,02:06:20.906,"So if I look at a table, how can I talk to you?"
02:06:22.575,02:06:30.499,"She thinks that my no speaking is because I can't be explaining myself like baby, but I am not like baby."
02:06:30.583,02:06:39.967,I am like old man and she's like small girl because I am fighting in war and she's not even knowing what war is.
02:06:40.509,02:06:42.219,Try.
02:06:42.302,02:06:46.306,Try to talk to me about some of your experiences...
02:06:47.516,02:06:51.436,or try to tell me what you are thinking.
02:06:54.231,02:06:56.441,I'm thinking about my future.
02:06:58.944,02:07:01.113,Very good.
02:07:01.196,02:07:04.158,So how do you see your future?
02:07:12.582,02:07:14.501,"Do me this favor, okay?"
02:07:19.757,02:07:24.637,"I think if you talk to me about it, it will make you feel better."
02:07:33.353,02:07:35.355,I saw terrible things...
02:07:37.858,02:07:40.695,and I did terrible things.
02:07:40.778,02:07:49.203,"So if I'm talking to you, it will make me sad... and it will make you, too, sad."
02:07:49.286,02:07:50.871,In this life...
02:07:52.748,02:07:55.876,I just want to be happy in this life.
02:07:58.587,02:08:01.090,If I'm telling this to you...
02:08:04.969,02:08:07.304,you will think that...
02:08:12.517,02:08:15.020,I am some sort of beast...
02:08:17.397,02:08:19.316,or devil.
02:08:23.320,02:08:25.655,I am all of these things...
02:08:28.117,02:08:30.535,but I also having mother...
