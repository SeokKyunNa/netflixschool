00:32:37.414,00:32:38.498,"YEAH, I LOVE IT."
00:33:42.980,00:33:43.814,CAN I HELP?
00:33:43.856,00:33:46.274,YEAH. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT GABLE ENTERPRISES.
00:33:46.316,00:33:47.442,THEY WENT BUST.
00:33:53.239,00:33:54.199,WHAT'S THAT?
00:33:54.240,00:33:55.408,Guard: NOTHING.
00:33:55.450,00:33:56.994,JUST TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING.
00:33:57.035,00:33:58.328,"GOT TO GO, SIR."
00:33:58.370,00:33:59.663,"NO, YOU'RE NOT."
00:33:59.705,00:34:00.789,WHAT ARE THOSE PEOPLE DOING BACK THERE?
00:34:00.831,00:34:02.624,IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
00:34:02.666,00:34:04.543,"IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S HAPPENING, I'LL REPORT YOU!"
00:34:04.584,00:34:07.546,YOU'RE TRESPASSING.
00:34:07.587,00:34:09.214,RIGHT.
00:34:38.117,00:34:39.912,MARLON!
00:34:39.953,00:34:40.787,TRUMAN.
00:34:40.829,00:34:41.872,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:34:41.914,00:34:43.248,I gotta talk to you.
00:34:43.289,00:34:44.833,"IT'S A BAD TIME, OK?"
00:34:44.875,00:34:47.669,"I'M ONTO SOMETHING, MARLON."
00:34:47.711,00:34:48.921,YOU OK?
00:34:48.962,00:34:50.255,I THINK I'M MIXED UP IN SOMETHING.
00:34:50.296,00:34:51.631,MIXED UP IN WHAT?
00:34:51.673,00:34:55.260,"THERE'S NO POINT TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT, BUT A LOT OF STRANGE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING."
00:34:59.806,00:35:02.059,THE PEOPLE ON THE ELEVATOR.
00:35:02.100,00:35:03.769,THERE WAS NO BACKING ON IT.
00:35:03.810,00:35:05.812,I LOOKED OUT.
00:35:05.854,00:35:11.192,"AND ON THE RADIO ON THE WAY TO WORK, IT STARTS FOLLOWING ME ALONG, TALKING ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT I'M DOING."
00:35:11.234,00:35:12.611,YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
00:35:12.652,00:35:14.571,"TRUMAN, LOOK, THIS IS ONE OF YOUR FANTASIES."
00:35:14.613,00:35:15.989,I THINK THIS IS ABOUT MY DAD.
00:35:16.031,00:35:17.115,YOUR DAD?
00:35:17.156,00:35:18.283,I THINK HE'S ALIVE.
00:35:18.324,00:35:21.036,YEAH. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER.
00:35:21.078,00:35:22.454,I'm definitely being followed.
00:35:22.495,00:35:24.163,WHO?
00:35:25.540,00:35:27.125,IT'S HARD TO TELL.
00:35:27.166,00:35:29.586,THEY LOOK JUST LIKE REGULAR PEOPLE.
00:35:33.214,00:35:34.299,HOW ABOUT THOSE TWO?
00:35:34.340,00:35:35.300,Truman: I DON'T KNOW.
00:35:35.341,00:35:37.094,COULD BE.
00:35:37.135,00:35:40.555,"It's when I'm unpredictable, that's--they can't..."
00:35:42.515,00:35:43.934,Did anything happen?
00:35:43.976,00:35:44.851,NO.
00:35:44.893,00:35:46.686,Mm-hmm. We gotta get out of here.
00:35:46.728,00:35:47.854,You ready to go?
00:35:47.896,00:35:49.147,No. I just came here.
00:35:49.188,00:35:50.231,I TOLD YOU I CAN'T.
00:35:54.945,00:35:57.447,YOU'RE GONNA GET BOTH OUR ASSES FIRED. YOU KNOW THAT.
00:35:57.489,00:35:59.324,"OK, MAN, LET'S DO IT."
00:35:59.365,00:36:00.492,WHAT?
00:36:00.533,00:36:01.701,I'M GAME.
00:36:01.743,00:36:03.202,Marlon: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
00:36:03.244,00:36:07.332,"YES, SIREE. YOUR BIRTHDAY COMES BUT ONCE A YEAR."
00:36:09.208,00:36:11.670,Truman: MAYBE I'M BEING SET UP FOR SOMETHING.
00:36:11.711,00:36:14.673,"YOU EVER THINK ABOUT THAT, MARLON?"
00:36:14.714,00:36:18.384,LIKE YOUR WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN BUILDING TOWARDS SOMETHING?
00:36:18.426,00:36:20.137,"MMM, NO."
00:36:20.178,00:36:27.352,"WHEN YOU WERE HAULING CHICKENS IN THE SUMMER FOR KAISER, WHAT WAS THE FURTHEST YOU EVER GOT OFF THE ISLAND?"
00:36:27.393,00:36:29.187,WENT ALL OVER.
00:36:29.228,00:36:32.107,"NEVER FOUND A PLACE LIKE THIS, THOUGH."
00:36:32.149,00:36:33.358,"LOOK AT THAT SUNSET, TRUMAN."
00:36:33.399,00:36:35.234,IT'S PERFECT.
00:36:35.276,00:36:37.529,YEAH.
00:36:37.570,00:36:39.906,THAT'S THE BIG GUY.
00:36:39.948,00:36:42.159,QUITE A PAINTBRUSH HE'S GOT.
00:36:42.200,00:36:43.827,YUP.
00:36:46.830,00:36:49.582,"JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME, MARLON..."
00:36:50.834,00:36:54.087,I'M GOING AWAY FOR A WHILE.
00:36:54.129,00:36:56.006,REALLY?
00:36:56.048,00:36:57.465,YEAH.
00:36:57.507,00:37:00.510,"Mother: OH, LITTLE ANGEL."
00:37:05.724,00:37:07.934,"OH, MY LITTLE CLOWN."
00:37:10.770,00:37:12.230,OLD CARROT TOP.

00:37:17.318,00:37:19.154,"WE SHOULD BE GETTING YOU HOME, MOTHER."
00:37:19.196,00:37:22.240,HOLD ON A MINUTE.
00:37:22.281,00:37:24.659,"DO YOU REMEMBER, TRUMAN, WHEN DAD WAS STILL WITH US?"
00:37:24.701,00:37:26.452,THAT WAS QUITE A DRIVE.
00:37:26.494,00:37:28.914,YOU SLEPT THE WHOLE WAY THERE.
00:37:28.955,00:37:30.665,Truman: IT LOOKS SO SMALL.
00:37:30.707,00:37:32.751,"THINGS ALWAYS DO WHEN YOU LOOK BACK, DARLING."
00:37:32.792,00:37:33.919,"OH, LOOK, TRUMAN."
00:37:33.960,00:37:38.506,THE HAPPIEST DAY OF OUR LIVES.
00:37:38.548,00:37:39.925,"OH, LOOK."
00:37:39.966,00:37:42.177,"JEAN, JODIE, JOANNE."
00:37:42.219,00:37:43.929,"DOESN'T SHE LOOK BEAUTIFUL, TRUMAN?"
00:37:43.970,00:37:46.264,"WELL, SHE STILL DOES."
00:37:46.305,00:37:50.393,AND THERE'S LOTS OF PAGES LEFT OVER FOR BABY PHOTOS.
00:37:50.435,00:37:54.147,I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD A GRANDCHILD IN MY ARMS BEFORE I GO.
00:37:54.189,00:37:56.149,"ANGELA, WE REALLY SHOULD BE GETTING YOU HOME."
00:37:56.191,00:37:57.567,I'LL TAKE HER.
00:37:57.609,00:38:00.153,"YOU STAY, RELAX."
00:38:00.195,00:38:02.614,YOUR FAVORITE SHOW WILL BE COMING ON.
00:38:02.655,00:38:05.033,"BESIDES, WE HAVE SOMETHING TO DISCUSS."
00:38:05.075,00:38:07.577,A CERTAIN PERSON'S BIRTHDAY.
00:38:07.619,00:38:09.871,"OH, I SEE."
00:38:09.913,00:38:13.499,TV announcer: AND THERE'LL BE ANOTHER EPISODE OF I LOVE LUCY SAME TIME TOMORROW.
00:38:13.541,00:38:16.920,BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S TIME FOR GOLDEN OLDIES.
00:38:16.962,00:38:21.758,"TONIGHT, WE PRESENT THE ENDURING, MUCH-LOVED CLASSIC SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO HOME."
00:38:21.800,00:38:30.850,"A HYMN OF PRAISE TO SMALL-TOWN LIFE, WHERE WE LEARN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE HOME TO DISCOVER WHAT THE WORLD'S ALL ABOUT, AND THAT NO ONE IS POOR WHO HAS FRIENDS."
00:38:30.892,00:38:39.151,"FULL OF LAUGHTER AND LOVE, PAIN AND SADNESS, BUT ULTIMATELY REDEMPTION, WE SHARE THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF THE ABBOTT FAMILY."
00:38:39.192,00:38:42.112,NOTE THE TOUCHING PERFORMANCE OF RONALD BRIERLY AS UNCLE BUDDY.
00:38:42.154,00:38:46.658,AND THAT SCENE WITH THE BOWL OF CHERRIES IS GONNA HAVE YOU SPLITTING YOUR SIDES WITH LAUGHTER ALL OVER AGAIN.
00:38:46.699,00:38:51.454,"AND THERE'LL BE TEARS, TOO, WHEN DAVID AND JENNIFER ARE REUNITED."
00:38:51.496,00:38:53.790,BUT ENOUGH FROM ME.
00:38:51.496,00:38:56.042,LET'S JOIN THE ABBOTTS IN CAMDEN VILLAGE.
00:39:20.817,00:39:22.360,OH.
00:39:22.401,00:39:24.321,"THANK YOU, SWEETIE."
00:39:28.616,00:39:32.370,"I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, BUT LET'S GO OUTSIDE."
00:39:32.411,00:39:35.081,"OH, SWEETIE, I'D LOVE TO, BUT I'M REALLY LATE."
00:39:35.123,00:39:36.291,WHAT'S YOUR RUSH?
00:39:38.084,00:39:39.502,SURGERY.
00:39:39.544,00:39:41.213,THERE WAS THAT ELEVATOR DISASTER DOWNTOWN.
00:39:41.254,00:39:43.006,IT WAS ON THE NEWS LAST NIGHT.
00:39:43.048,00:39:45.008,THIS CABLE JUST SNAPPED.
00:39:43.048,00:39:47.135,"THIS ELEVATOR, IT JUST PLUMMETED DOWN 10 FLIGHTS."
00:39:47.177,00:39:48.386,THE NON-UNION WORKERS.
00:39:48.427,00:39:50.930,JUST MONSTERS.
00:39:48.427,00:39:52.265,"YOU KNOW, THAT BUILDING, IT'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WHERE YOU WORK."
00:39:52.307,00:39:54.351,CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU HAD BEEN IN THERE?
00:39:54.392,00:39:55.935,IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH THINKING ABOUT.
00:39:55.977,00:39:59.814,"ANYWAY, I HAVE AN AMPUTATION ON ONE OF THE YOUNG WOMEN IN THAT ELEVATOR."
00:39:59.856,00:40:01.066,SHE'S VERY YOUNG.
00:40:01.107,00:40:02.108,IT'S VERY SAD.
00:40:02.150,00:40:04.361,"ANYWAY, WISH ME LUCK."
00:40:04.402,00:40:06.071,I'LL CROSS MY FINGERS FOR YOU.
00:40:47.779,00:40:50.073,"UH, EXCUSE ME."
00:40:50.115,00:40:51.574,MAY I HELP YOU?
00:40:51.616,00:40:53.034,"OH, UH..."
00:40:53.076,00:40:56.704,"YES. I'M LOOKING FOR MY WIFE, NURSE BURBANK."
00:40:56.746,00:40:58.123,IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
00:40:58.164,00:40:59.958,I'M AFRAID THAT THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
00:40:59.999,00:41:01.293,SHE'S IN PRE-OP.
00:41:01.334,00:41:02.961,SURE.
00:41:03.002,00:41:04.963,"OK, FINE."
00:41:05.004,00:41:06.423,CAN YOU PASS ALONG A MESSAGE?
00:41:06.464,00:41:07.548,I'LL TRY.
00:41:07.590,00:41:11.094,CAN YOU TELL HER I HAD TO GO TO FIJI AND THAT I'LL CALL HER WHEN I GET THERE?
00:41:11.136,00:41:13.846,WHEN YOU-- WHEN YOU GET TO FIJI?

00:41:46.463,00:41:47.422,IT'S OK.
00:41:47.464,00:41:49.382,"HERE, LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT."
00:41:54.971,00:41:56.222,HE'S HERE.
00:41:58.057,00:42:00.977,"Meryl: I KNOW, I KNOW."
00:42:01.019,00:42:02.187,SCALPEL.
00:42:05.064,00:42:06.399,AHEM.
00:42:08.443,00:42:16.575,I'M NOW MAKING MY PRIMARY INCISION JUST ABOVE THE RIGHT KNEE.
00:42:21.039,00:42:22.248,NICELY DONE.
00:42:22.290,00:42:25.084,THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE PRETTY.
00:42:25.126,00:42:27.712,IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL.
00:42:27.753,00:42:29.630,BEAUTIFUL JOB.
00:42:29.672,00:42:33.218,I'LL JUST LET SOMEONE ELSE TIDY UP HERE.
00:42:56.908,00:42:59.202,I'M SORRY TO KEEP YOU.
00:42:59.244,00:43:01.204,"OH, THAT'S OK."
00:43:02.455,00:43:03.498,HOW CAN I HELP?
00:43:03.540,00:43:06.084,I WOULD LIKE TO BOOK A FLIGHT TO FIJI.
00:43:06.125,00:43:09.962,WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE?
00:43:11.423,00:43:12.298,TODAY.

00:43:38.950,00:43:40.118,YOU WANT TO BOOK THE FLIGHT?
00:43:40.159,00:43:42.703,IT DOESN'T MATTER.
00:43:42.745,00:43:45.498,"I'LL MAKE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS, OK?"

00:45:26.349,00:45:28.518,"HIS FATHER WAS FROM CHICAGO, WASN'T HE?"
00:45:28.560,00:45:30.978,NO. HIS DENTIST WAS FROM PENSACOLA.
00:45:31.020,00:45:32.647,HIS FATHER WAS FROM DES MOINES.
00:45:32.689,00:45:34.940,BUT HOW COME HE WANTS TO GO TO CHICAGO?
00:45:34.982,00:45:38.069,HE'S NOT GOING TO CHICAGO.

00:46:16.982,00:46:18.317,WHAT?
00:46:19.068,00:46:31.330,"I PREDICT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT WE WILL SEE A LADY ON A RED BIKE, FOLLOWED BY A MAN WITH FLOWERS AND A VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE WITH A DENTED FENDER."
00:46:31.372,00:46:33.040,"TRUMAN, PLEASE."
00:46:33.082,00:46:34.709,Truman: LOOK.

00:47:03.780,00:47:05.030,I'LL TELL YOU.
00:47:05.072,00:47:05.990,THEY'RE ON A LOOP.
00:47:06.031,00:47:07.659,THEY GO AROUND THE BLOCK.

00:47:11.036,00:47:12.580,ROUND AND ROUND.
00:47:12.622,00:47:15.500,I INVITED RITA AND MARLON FOR A BARBECUE ON SUNDAY.
00:47:15.541,00:47:17.084,I WON'T BE HERE SUNDAY.

00:55:09.807,00:55:12.268,IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!
00:55:12.308,00:55:14.145,"SHH, IT'S OK."
00:55:16.354,00:55:18.314,EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK.

00:55:19.775,00:55:22.360,IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE.
00:55:24.238,00:55:26.865,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK, MARLON."
00:55:30.661,00:55:34.206,"MAYBE I'M LOSING MY MIND, BUT..."
00:55:37.168,00:55:42.173,IT FEELS LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD REVOLVES AROUND ME SOMEHOW.
00:55:42.214,00:55:46.177,"THAT'S A LOT OF WORLD FOR ONE MAN, TRUMAN."
00:55:47.261,00:55:49.763,SURE THAT'S NOT WISHFUL THINKING?
00:55:49.805,00:55:54.018,YOU WISHING YOU'D MADE SOMETHING MORE OUT OF YOURSELF?

00:55:59.397,00:56:01.025,WHO HASN'T WANTED TO BE SOMEBODY?
00:56:01.066,00:56:04.486,THIS IS DIFFERENT.
00:56:09.074,00:56:12.536,I'VE BEEN YOUR BEST FRIEND SINCE WE WERE 7 YEARS OLD.
00:56:12.577,00:56:17.041,THE ONLY WAY YOU AND I EVER MADE IT THROUGH SCHOOL WAS BY CHEATING OFF EACH OTHER'S TEST PAPERS.
00:56:18.250,00:56:20.919,"JESUS, THEY WERE IDENTICAL."
00:56:22.254,00:56:25.757,BUT I ALWAYS FELT SAFE KNOWING THAT.
00:56:25.799,00:56:31.180,"'CAUSE WHATEVER THE ANSWER WAS, WE WERE RIGHT TOGETHER AND WE WERE WRONG TOGETHER."
00:56:32.514,00:56:37.353,REMEMBER WHEN I STAYED UP ALL NIGHT IN YOUR TENT 'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO PLAY NORTH POLE?
00:56:38.812,00:56:39.938,AND I GOT PNEUMONIA?
00:56:42.066,00:56:43.234,YOU REMEMBER THAT?
00:56:44.484,00:56:47.279,YOU WERE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR ABOUT A MONTH.
00:56:52.617,00:56:55.996,YOU'RE THE CLOSEST THING I EVER HAD TO A BROTHER.
00:57:02.586,00:57:05.089,I KNOW THAT THINGS...
00:57:05.130,00:57:10.052,HAVEN'T REALLY WORKED OUT FOR EITHER OF US LIKE WE USED TO DREAM THEY WOULD.
00:57:10.094,00:57:15.307,"I KNOW THAT FEELING, WHEN IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING'S SLIPPING AWAY..."
00:57:15.349,00:57:20.145,"YOU DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT, SO YOU LOOK FOR ANSWERS SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT..."
00:57:24.733,00:57:26.068,WELL...
00:57:26.110,00:57:30.072,"Christof: BUT, WELL, THE POINT IS..."
00:57:30.114,00:57:32.991,I'D GLADLY WALK IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC FOR YOU.
00:57:36.494,00:57:38.247,Marlon: WELL...
00:57:38.289,00:57:42.584,"THE POINT IS, I WOULD GLADLY STEP IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC FOR YOU, TRUMAN."
00:57:42.626,00:57:47.005,AND THE LAST THING I'D EVER DO IS LIE TO YOU.
00:57:48.673,00:57:54.054,AND THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD EVER DO...
00:57:54.096,00:57:55.973,IS LIE TO YOU.
00:57:58.934,00:58:01.645,"I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, TRUMAN."
00:58:01.686,00:58:05.357,IF EVERYBODY IS IN ON IT...
00:58:05.399,00:58:07.985,"I'D HAVE TO BE IN ON IT, TOO."
00:58:16.952,00:58:20.164,"I'M NOT IN ON IT, TRUMAN, BECAUSE..."
00:58:20.205,00:58:21.999,THERE IS NO IT.
00:58:25.710,00:58:28.088,"YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING, THOUGH."
00:58:29.547,00:58:30.424,WHAT'S THAT?
00:58:31.883,00:58:34.970,THE THING THAT STARTED ALL THIS.
00:58:49.443,00:58:52.570,"YEP. I FOUND HIM FOR YOU, TRUMAN."
00:58:52.612,00:58:55.366,THAT'S WHY I CAME BY TONIGHT.
00:58:55.407,00:58:58.202,I'M SURE HE'S GOT QUITE A STORY TO TELL.
00:59:02.289,00:59:03.999,GO TO HIM.
00:59:09.880,00:59:11.882,EASY ON THE FOG.
00:59:13.675,00:59:16.678,"STAND BY, CRANE CAM."
00:59:16.720,00:59:18.096,CRANE CAM.
00:59:25.979,00:59:28.065,BUTTON CAM 3.
00:59:39.243,00:59:43.080,I NEVER STOPPED BELIEVING.
00:59:45.040,00:59:48.585,"Christof: AND WIDE, CURB CAM 8."
00:59:48.626,00:59:51.296,MY SON! OH!

00:59:52.964,00:59:54.007,"NO, NO, NO."
00:59:55.967,00:59:59.513,MOVE BACK AND...
01:00:05.602,01:00:07.938,AND NOW GO IN CLOSE.
01:00:07.979,01:00:10.815,ALL THOSE YEARS WASTED.
01:00:10.857,01:00:13.902,"I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU, SON."
01:00:13.944,01:00:15.946,I SWEAR.
01:00:21.993,01:00:23.203,DAD.
01:00:24.913,01:00:26.498,YES!
01:00:35.632,01:00:37.468,BRAVO.
01:00:37.509,01:00:39.177,THAT WAS A REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE.
01:00:40.220,01:00:41.430,Tech: CONGRATULATIONS.
01:00:41.472,01:00:43.265,"OK, QUIET DOWN."
01:00:43.307,01:00:45.809,Chloe: THAT WAS GOOD WORK.
01:00:45.850,01:00:47.102,WHOO!
01:00:47.144,01:00:48.228,Tech: LET'S GET SOME CHAMPAGNE UP HERE.
01:00:48.270,01:00:50.481,CONGRATULATIONS.
01:00:50.522,01:00:52.441,"Moses: BRILLIANT, CHRISTOF."
01:00:52.483,01:00:55.360,Roman: IT JUST BROKE MY HEART.
01:00:58.655,01:00:59.990,"WELL DONE, EVERYONE!"
01:01:00.031,01:01:01.450,BRAVO!
01:01:19.384,01:01:22.720,Announcer: 1.7 BILLION WERE THERE FOR HIS BIRTH.
01:01:26.391,01:01:29.727,220 COUNTRIES TUNED IN FOR HIS FIRST STEP.
01:01:29.769,01:01:36.693,"THE WORLD STOOD STILL FOR THAT STOLEN KISS, AND AS HE GREW, SO DID THE TECHNOLOGY."
01:01:36.734,01:01:49.331,"AN ENTIRE HUMAN LIFE RECORDED ON AN INTRICATE NETWORK OF HIDDEN CAMERAS AND BROADCAST LIVE AND UNEDITED 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK TO AN AUDIENCE AROUND THE GLOBE."
01:01:49.373,01:02:07.891,"COMING TO YOU NOW FROM SEAHAVEN ISLAND, ENCLOSED IN THE LARGEST STUDIO EVER CONSTRUCTED, AND ALONG WITH THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA, ONE OF ONLY 2 MANMADE STRUCTURES VISIBLE FROM SPACE, NOW IN ITS 30th GREAT YEAR, IT'S..."
01:02:11.687,01:02:13.813,WHAT A WEEK IT'S BEEN.
01:02:11.687,01:02:15.940,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU-- I WAS ON PINS AND NEEDLES THE ENTIRE TIME.
01:02:15.982,01:02:19.194,HELLO AND GOOD EVENING.
01:02:15.982,01:02:22.864,"I'M YOUR HOST MIKE MICHAELSON, AND WELCOME TO TRU-TALK, OUR FORUM FOR ISSUES GROWING OUT OF THE SHOW."
01:02:22.906,01:02:30.830,"BUT TONIGHT, SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL INDEED, A RARE AND EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH THE SHOW'S CONCEIVER AND CREATOR."
01:02:30.872,01:02:47.180,"SO, COME WITH US NOW AS WE GO LIVE TO THE LUNAR ROOM ON THE 221st FLOOR OF THE OMNI CAM ECHOSPHERE, WHERE WE'LL FIND THE WORLD'S GREATEST TELE-VISIONARY-- THE DESIGNER AND ARCHITECT OF THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD THAT IS SEAHAVEN ISLAND-- CHRISTOF."
01:02:47.222,01:02:52.728,"BEFORE WE BEGIN, I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ON BEHALF OF OUR AUDIENCE FOR GRANTING THIS INTERVIEW."
01:02:52.769,01:02:58.442,"WE KNOW HOW DEMANDING YOUR SCHEDULE IS, AND WE ALL KNOW HOW JEALOUSLY YOU GUARD YOUR PRIVACY."
01:02:58.483,01:03:00.944,"THIS, SIR, IS INDEED AN HONOR."
01:03:00.985,01:03:02.446,DON'T MENTION IT.
01:03:02.487,01:03:09.536,"WELL, THE CATALYST FOR THE RECENT DRAMATIC EVENTS ON THE SHOW HAS BEEN TRUMAN'S FATHER, KIRK, AND HIS ATTEMPTS TO INFILTRATE THE SHOW."
01:03:09.578,01:03:16.627,"BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME SOMEONE FROM THE OUTSIDE HAS ATTEMPTED TO REACH TRUMAN, IS IT?"
01:03:16.668,01:03:18.754,Christof: WE HAVE HAD CLOSE CALLS IN THE PAST.
01:03:18.795,01:03:21.632,Man: TRUMAN!
01:03:21.673,01:03:22.966,YES!
01:03:23.007,01:03:25.093,YES! I DID IT!
01:03:25.135,01:03:26.720,I'M ON THE TRUMAN SHOW!
01:03:26.762,01:03:34.811,Mike: BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING TO COMPARE WITH THIS MOST RECENT BREACH IN SECURITY-- THE FIRST INTRUDER TO BE A FORMER CAST MEMBER.
01:03:34.852,01:03:36.062,A DEAD ONE AT THAT.
01:03:36.104,01:03:39.775,"GOTTA SAY, WRITING KIRK BACK IN--MASTERSTROKE."
01:03:39.816,01:03:45.905,"SINCE KIRK STARTED THIS CRISIS IN TRUMAN'S LIFE, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT ONLY HE COULD END IT."
01:03:45.947,01:03:48.533,TRUMAN! TRUMAN! NO!
01:03:49.867,01:03:50.827,THAT'S OFF LIMITS!
01:03:50.868,01:03:52.496,WHY? WHAT'S OVER THERE?
01:03:52.537,01:03:54.665,NOTHING. IT'S DANGEROUS.
01:03:54.706,01:03:56.500,"YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW YOUR LIMITATIONS, TRUMAN."
01:03:56.541,01:04:01.505,Mike: BUT LET'S REMIND VIEWERS EXACTLY WHY DAD WAS WRITTEN OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
01:04:01.546,01:04:06.718,"Christof: AS TRUMAN GREW UP, WE WERE FORCED TO MANUFACTURE WAYS TO KEEP HIM ON THE ISLAND."
01:04:06.760,01:04:09.971,"I'D LIKE TO BE AN EXPLORER, LIKE THE GREAT MAGELLAN."
01:04:10.013,01:04:11.264,YOU'RE TOO LATE.
01:04:11.306,01:04:13.850,THERE'S REALLY NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE.
01:04:18.104,01:04:20.857,"Christof: FINALLY, I CAME UP WITH KIRK'S DROWNING."
01:04:20.898,01:04:22.108,Mike: MOST EFFECTIVE.
01:04:22.150,01:04:24.027,TRUMAN'S BEEN TERRIFIED OF THE WATER EVER SINCE.
01:04:24.068,01:04:29.866,"Christof: WHEN KIRK READ THE SYNOPSIS OF THE EPISODE, HE WAS DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST."
01:04:29.907,01:04:31.409,JESUS!
01:04:31.451,01:04:34.496,I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT CAUSED HIM TO BREAK ONTO THE SET.
01:04:34.538,01:04:39.209,BUT HOW DO YOU INTEND TO EXPLAIN HIS 22-YEAR ABSENCE?
01:04:39.250,01:04:40.627,AMNESIA.
01:04:40.669,01:04:44.047,BRILLIANT. LET'S TAKE SOME VIEWER PHONE CALLS.
01:04:44.088,01:04:47.592,"CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA, YOU'RE ON WITH CHRISTOF."
01:04:47.634,01:04:50.679,"Man: UH, YEAH, HI, CHRISTOF."
01:04:50.721,01:04:53.807,I WAS WONDERING HOW MANY CAMERAS YOU GOT IN THAT TOWN.
01:04:53.849,01:04:56.226,"SOMEWHERE IN THE VICINITY OF 5,000."
01:04:56.267,01:04:58.854,Man: THAT'S A LOT OF CAMERAS.
01:04:58.895,01:05:01.857,"REMEMBER, WE STARTED WITH JUST ONE."
01:05:01.898,01:05:06.319,HE WAS CURIOUS FROM BIRTH.
01:05:06.361,01:05:07.738,PREMATURE BY 2 WEEKS.
01:05:07.779,01:05:09.906,ALMOST AS IF HE COULDN'T WAIT TO GET STARTED.
01:05:09.947,01:05:14.911,Mike: HIS EAGERNESS TO LEAVE HIS MOTHER'S WOMB WAS THE VERY REASON HE WAS THE ONE SELECTED.
01:05:14.952,01:05:23.294,"IN COMPETITION WITH 5 OTHER UNWANTED PREGNANCIES, THE CASTING OF A SHOW, DETERMINED BY AN AIR DATE, TRUMAN WAS THE ONE WHO ARRIVED ON CUE."
01:05:27.883,01:05:32.929,"Mike: INCIDENTALLY, I BELIEVE TRUMAN IS THE FIRST CHILD TO HAVE BEEN LEGALLY ADOPTED BY A CORPORATION."
01:05:32.970,01:05:34.389,THAT'S CORRECT.
01:05:34.431,01:05:40.019,"THE SHOW HAS GENERATED ENORMOUS REVENUES NOW, EQUIVALENT TO THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT OF A SMALL COUNTRY."
01:05:40.061,01:05:43.690,PEOPLE FORGET IT TAKES THE POPULATION OF AN ENTIRE COUNTRY TO KEEP THE SHOW RUNNING.
01:05:43.732,01:05:51.823,"SINCE THE SHOW IS ON 24-HOURS A DAY WITHOUT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTION, ALL THOSE STAGGERING REVENUES ARE GENERATED BY PRODUCT PLACEMENT."
01:05:51.865,01:05:54.158,THAT'S TRUE. EVERYTHING ON THE SHOW IS FOR SALE.
01:05:54.200,01:05:57.203,"FROM THE ACTOR'S WARDROBE, FOOD PRODUCTS, TO THE VERY HOMES THEY LIVE IN."
01:05:57.245,01:06:00.081,Mike: AND ALL OF IT AVAILABLE IN THE TRUMAN CATALOG.
01:06:00.123,01:06:01.458,OPERATORS ARE STANDING BY.
01:06:01.499,01:06:10.216,"CHRISTOF, LET ME ASK YOU, WHY DO YOU THINK TRUMAN HAS NEVER COME CLOSE TO DISCOVERING THE TRUE NATURE OF HIS WORLD UNTIL NOW?"
01:06:10.258,01:06:14.178,WE ACCEPT THE REALITY OF THE WORLD WITH WHICH WE ARE PRESENTED.
01:06:14.220,01:06:16.473,IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
01:06:16.514,01:06:18.308,THE HAGUE FOR CHRISTOF.
01:06:18.349,01:06:21.937,HELLO? THE HAGUE?
01:06:21.978,01:06:23.814,"ALL RIGHT, WE'VE LOST THAT CALL."
01:06:23.855,01:06:25.732,LET'S GO TO HOLLYWOOD.
01:06:25.774,01:06:28.401,"HI, CHRISTOF. I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY ONE THING."
01:06:28.443,01:06:31.947,"YOU'RE A LIAR AND A MANIPULATOR, AND WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO TRUMAN IS SICK!"
01:06:31.988,01:06:37.076,"WELL, WE REMEMBER THIS VOICE, DON'T WE?"
01:06:37.118,01:06:38.411,HOW COULD WE FORGET?
01:06:38.453,01:06:39.788,Mike: LET'S GO TO ANOTHER CALL.
01:06:39.830,01:06:43.541,"NO, NO, NO."
01:06:43.583,01:06:47.170,I LOVE TO REMINISCE WITH FORMER MEMBERS OF THE CAST.
01:06:47.211,01:06:49.840,SYLVIA...
01:06:49.881,01:06:58.598,"AS YOU ANNOUNCED SO MELODRAMATICALLY TO THE WORLD, YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU BATTED YOUR EYES AT TRUMAN ONCE..."
01:06:58.640,01:07:00.684,FLIRTED WITH HIM...
01:07:00.725,01:07:02.769,STOLE A FEW MINUTES OF AIR TIME WITH HIM...
01:07:02.811,01:07:06.147,TO THRUST YOURSELF AND YOUR POLITICS INTO THE LIMELIGHT...
01:07:06.189,01:07:07.858,THAT YOU KNOW HIM?
01:07:07.899,01:07:09.860,THAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT FOR HIM?
01:07:09.901,01:07:12.737,YOU REALLY THINK YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO JUDGE HIM?
01:07:12.779,01:07:17.868,WHAT RIGHT DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE A BABY AND TURN HIS LIFE INTO SOME KIND OF MOCKERY?
01:07:17.909,01:07:21.830,DON'T YOU EVER FEEL GUILTY?
01:07:21.872,01:07:27.126,I HAVE GIVEN TRUMAN A CHANCE TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE.
01:07:27.168,01:07:29.504,THE WORLD...
01:07:29.546,01:07:31.548,THE PLACE YOU LIVE IN...
01:07:31.589,01:07:33.550,IS THE SICK PLACE.
01:07:34.968,01:07:36.970,SEAHAVEN'S THE WAY THE WORLD SHOULD BE.
01:07:37.012,01:07:38.847,HE'S NOT A PERFORMER.
01:07:38.889,01:07:41.182,LOOK AT HIM! LOOK AT WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO HIM!
01:07:41.224,01:07:42.600,HE CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME.
01:07:42.642,01:07:52.736,"IF HIS WAS MORE THAN JUST A VAGUE AMBITION, IF HE WAS ABSOLUTELY DETERMINED TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH, THERE'S NO WAY WE COULD PREVENT HIM."
01:07:52.777,01:08:00.785,"I THINK WHAT DISTRESSES YOU REALLY, CALLER, IS THAT ULTIMATELY..."
01:08:00.827,01:08:04.831,"TRUMAN PREFERS HIS CELL, AS YOU CALL IT."
01:08:04.873,01:08:06.875,THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
01:08:06.917,01:08:10.169,"YOU'RE SO WRONG, AND HE'LL PROVE YOU WRONG."
01:08:10.211,01:08:17.677,"Mike: WELL, ASIDE FROM THE HEATED COMMENTS OF A VERY VOCAL MINORITY, IT'S BEEN AN OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE."
01:08:17.719,01:08:19.930,YES. FOR TRUMAN AND FOR THE VIEWING PUBLIC.
01:08:19.971,01:08:24.684,"WELL, CHRISTOF, I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR GIVING SO GENEROUSLY OF YOUR TIME TONIGHT."
01:08:24.726,01:08:32.149,"I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY NOW THAT THIS CRISIS IS BEHIND US AND TRUMAN IS BACK TO HIS OLD SELF, WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO SOME EXCITING NEW DEVELOPMENTS?"
01:08:32.191,01:08:40.491,"WELL, MIKE, THE BIG NEWS IS THAT MERYL WILL BE LEAVING TRUMAN IN AN UPCOMING EPISODE, AND A NEW ROMANTIC INTEREST WILL BE INTRODUCED."
01:08:40.533,01:08:42.118,Mike: AHA.
01:08:42.159,01:08:45.789,I'M DETERMINED TELEVISION'S FIRST ON-AIR CONCEPTION WILL STILL TAKE PLACE.
01:08:45.830,01:08:49.417,"WELL, ANOTHER TELEVISION MILESTONE STRAIGHT AHEAD."
01:08:49.459,01:08:50.877,YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST.
01:08:50.919,01:08:52.796,"IT HAS BEEN A SINGULAR HONOR AND PLEASURE, SIR."
01:08:52.837,01:08:54.631,CHRISTOF...THANK YOU.
01:08:54.672,01:08:56.091,"THANK YOU, MIKE."
01:10:13.835,01:10:15.211,"HEY, SIMEON."
01:10:19.924,01:10:21.051,IS HE LOOKING AT US?
01:10:21.092,01:10:24.095,"JESUS, DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS?"
01:10:24.137,01:10:26.430,HELLO?
01:10:26.472,01:10:27.932,BETTER CALL CHRISTOF.
01:10:27.974,01:10:31.394,HELLO?
01:10:42.906,01:10:44.991,HA HA!
01:10:47.869,01:10:50.038,HE'S BACK TO HIS OLD SELF.
01:10:50.080,01:10:51.664,THANK GOD.
01:10:58.796,01:11:02.008,"THAT'S AN UNUSUAL CAT, MY MAN."
01:11:05.803,01:11:07.805,I HEREBY...
01:11:07.847,01:11:10.058,PROCLAIM THIS PLANET...
01:11:13.853,01:11:17.857,TRUMANIA OF THE BURBANK GALAXY.
01:11:19.525,01:11:21.318,IS HE GOING?
01:11:23.487,01:11:25.281,THAT ONE'S FOR FREE.
01:11:25.322,01:11:27.867,KEEP UP WITH HIM.
01:11:27.909,01:11:29.326,"STAND BY, ALL HOUSE CAMERAS."
01:11:30.494,01:11:31.829,MORNING!
01:11:31.871,01:11:33.957,All: MORNING.
01:11:33.998,01:11:35.750,IN CASE I DON'T SEE YOU...
01:11:35.792,01:11:39.087,"All: GOOD AFTERNOON, GOOD EVENING, AND GOOD NIGHT."
01:11:40.880,01:11:42.715,GOOD AFTERNOON...
01:11:42.757,01:11:43.967,GOOD MORNING.
01:11:44.008,01:11:46.094,"...EVENING, AND GOOD NIGHT."
01:11:46.136,01:11:48.638,MORNING.
01:11:48.679,01:11:49.889,HOW'S IT GOING?
01:11:49.931,01:11:51.474,"HMM, LET ME CHECK."
01:11:51.515,01:11:54.102,VITAL SIGNS ARE GOOD.
01:11:55.436,01:11:57.272,"WHOA, PLUTO! WHOOP!"
01:11:57.313,01:11:58.522,"Both: GOOD MORNING, TRUMAN!"
01:11:58.564,01:12:00.900,"OH, LOOK WHO'S HERE."
01:12:00.942,01:12:01.734,"BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT?"
01:12:01.776,01:12:03.111,EVERY SINGLE DAY.
01:12:03.153,01:12:04.821,THE POLICY-- WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT...
01:12:04.862,01:12:05.947,Both: AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT.
01:12:05.989,01:12:07.573,YOU'RE KIDDING?
01:12:07.615,01:12:10.160,"GREAT! WHY DON'T WE GO UP TO MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW, AND WE'LL SIGN THE PAPERS?"
01:12:10.201,01:12:11.828,"UH, NEXT WEEK WOULD BE MUCH BETTER."
01:12:11.869,01:12:13.079,NEXT WEEK WOULD BE BETTER.
01:12:13.121,01:12:14.705,ALL RIGHT.
01:12:14.747,01:12:16.707,"OK, BYE NOW."
01:12:16.749,01:12:18.209,GIVE ME SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO.
01:12:18.251,01:12:19.335,YOU GOT IT.
01:12:19.376,01:12:21.254,"SEE, THIS ISN'T ABOUT INSURANCE."
01:12:21.296,01:12:25.716,THIS IS ABOUT THE GREAT VARIABLE-- WHEN WILL DEATH OCCUR?
01:12:25.758,01:12:28.719,"COULD BE A WEEK, A MONTH, A YEAR."
01:12:28.761,01:12:30.346,COULD BE TODAY.
01:12:32.056,01:12:38.855,"SUNBATHER, MINDING HIS OWN BUSINESS, STABBED IN THE HEART BY THE TIP OF A RUNAWAY BEACH UMBRELLA."
01:12:38.896,01:12:40.564,NO WAY TO GUARD AGAINST THAT KIND OF THING.
01:12:43.484,01:12:45.069,"UH, SORRY, EXCUSE ME."
01:12:45.111,01:12:47.446,"UH, TRUMAN, THIS IS VIVIEN."
01:12:47.488,01:12:50.116,THE TWO OF YOU ARE GONNA BE NEIGHBORS.
01:12:50.158,01:12:51.201,OH.
01:12:52.952,01:12:59.959,"I GUESS WHAT I'M-- WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT, UH, LIFE IS...FRAGILE."
01:13:01.085,01:13:02.253,"Lawrence: VIVIEN, YOUR OFFICE."
01:13:02.295,01:13:03.296,SORRY.
01:13:03.338,01:13:04.672,WHAT'S THAT?
01:13:04.714,01:13:07.424,"OH, I'M SORRY."
01:13:07.466,01:13:08.676,YOU DO?
01:13:08.718,01:13:13.639,"OH, GREAT. UH, LET ME TAKE YOUR INFORMATION."
01:13:28.696,01:13:30.573,READY 2. GO TO 2.
01:13:34.785,01:13:36.453,AND BACK TO MEDIUM.
01:13:37.788,01:13:40.124,AND WIDE.
01:13:43.336,01:13:44.295,PSST!
01:13:47.965,01:13:51.468,I WAS JUST TRYING TO TRAIN THE KID TO...
01:13:51.510,01:13:52.929,NEVER MIND.
01:13:55.973,01:13:57.725,Christof: WHAT'S HE DOING IN THE BASEMENT?
01:13:57.767,01:14:00.603,HE MOVED DOWN THERE AFTER MERYL PACKED UP AND LEFT.
01:14:00.644,01:14:02.105,WHY WASN'T I TOLD?
01:14:02.146,01:14:05.441,ANY UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR HAS TO BE REPORTED.
01:14:05.482,01:14:08.361,"UH, HE--HE'S JUST SLEEPING, I THOUGHT."
01:14:08.403,01:14:10.321,THIS THE BEST SHOT WE'VE GOT?
01:14:10.363,01:14:11.114,WHAT'S TO SEE?

01:14:16.327,01:14:20.039,HE WAS JUST TIDYING UP HIS GARBAGE.
01:14:20.081,01:14:23.918,"I WAS GONNA CALL YOU, BUT HALFWAY THROUGH, HE GAVE UP, AND HE FELL ASLEEP."

01:14:55.199,01:14:57.327,GIVE ME A CLOSEUP ON HIS TORSO.
01:14:59.203,01:15:00.830,HE'S STILL BREATHING.

01:15:25.604,01:15:27.690,Christof: SHUT UP AND WATCH IT!
01:15:27.731,01:15:29.359,THEN WE WENT TO NIGHTVISION.
01:15:30.693,01:15:32.111,HE'S ASLEEP.

01:20:25.862,01:20:28.240,THE MEDIA IS HAVING A FEEDING FRENZY OVER THIS.
01:20:28.282,01:20:33.829,"ALL THE PHONE LINES ARE JAMMED, AND EVERY NETWORK HAS A PIRATED SHOT OF MARLON MAKING AN ASS OF HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA."
01:20:33.870,01:20:35.914,THE SPONSORS ARE THREATENING TO RIP UP THEIR CONTRACTS.

01:23:15.282,01:23:18.160,"BOTTOM LINE IS, THEY CAN'T DRIVE THE BOAT."
01:23:18.201,01:23:19.161,THEY'RE ACTORS.
01:23:23.123,01:23:24.875,HOW DO WE STOP HIM?
