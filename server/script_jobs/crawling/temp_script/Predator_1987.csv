00:13:12.709,00:13:15.836,WHOEVER HIT IT STRIPPED THE SHIT OUT OF IT.
00:13:15.878,00:13:18.381,TOOK HIM OUT WITH A HEAT-SEEKER.

00:13:56.043,00:13:58.212,PROBABLY JUST ANOTHER REBEL PATROL.
00:13:58.254,00:14:02.049,THEY OPERATE IN HERE ALL THE TIME.
00:14:02.091,00:14:05.844,- GET AHEAD AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.

00:17:08.110,00:17:11.030,NOBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS AN OPERATION IN THIS AREA.
00:17:11.071,00:17:14.575,THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HERE.
00:17:18.579,00:17:21.666,THE GUERRILLAS SKINNED THEM?
00:17:21.708,00:17:23.751,WHY DID THEY SKIN THEM?
00:17:25.169,00:17:27.547,AIN'T NO WAY FOR NO SOLDIER TO DIE.
00:17:32.134,00:17:35.722,"- WHAT HAPPENED HERE, BILLY?"
00:17:35.763,00:17:38.391,THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT.

00:17:41.853,00:17:44.313,I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT JIM HOPPER WALKED INTO AN AMBUSH.
00:17:44.355,00:17:47.107,I DON'T BELIEVE HE DID.
00:17:47.149,00:17:50.403,I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE TRACK.
00:17:50.444,00:17:52.321,JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
00:17:52.363,00:17:54.615,WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF HOPPER'S MEN?
00:17:54.657,00:17:57.410,"THERE'S NO SIGN, SIR."
