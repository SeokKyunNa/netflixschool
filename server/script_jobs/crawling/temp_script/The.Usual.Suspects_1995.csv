00:03:38.551,00:03:43.848,"I can't feel my legs, Keyser."
00:03:48.478,00:03:49.437,Ready?
00:04:01.574,00:04:02.700,What time is it?
00:04:04.410,00:04:05.411,12:30.
00:05:14.230,00:05:17.483,A truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of Queens.
00:05:17.859,00:05:19.902,"The driver didn't see anybody, but somebody fucked up."
00:05:20.194,00:05:21.237,He heard a voice.
00:05:21.612,00:05:22.864,Sometimes that's all you need.
00:05:23.948,00:05:30.913,NEW YORK CITY - 6 WEEKS AGO Christ. Don't you fuckin' guys ever sleep?
00:05:32.457,00:05:33.624,"Fuck you, pig."
00:05:43.885,00:05:44.886,Who wants to know?
00:05:45.053,00:05:46.554,New York Police Department.
00:05:59.942,00:06:01.110,Sure you brought enough guys?
00:06:38.648,00:06:43.277,A restaurant that changes with the taste without losing the overall aesthetic.
00:06:43.694,00:06:47.573,"In other words, the atmosphere will not be painted on the walls."
00:06:49.534,00:06:51.244,"Well, let me give you an example."
00:06:55.915,00:06:56.874,David.
00:06:58.417,00:07:00.169,-I'm in a meeting. -Time for another one.
00:07:01.462,00:07:03.798,"Everyone, this is David Kujan."
00:07:04.173,00:07:06.467,"Special Agent Kujan, US Customs."
00:07:07.260,00:07:09.512,These gentlemen are from the New York Police Department.
00:07:10.763,00:07:11.848,"You look good, Keaton."
00:07:12.306,00:07:13.516,Better than I would have thought.
00:07:23.609,00:07:25.153,Will you excuse us for a moment?
00:07:29.532,00:07:30.408,You're gonna be a while.
00:07:31.951,00:07:34.829,"No, no, no. Please, please, please. Sit down."
00:07:34.912,00:07:37.957,"This is, uh, this is a small problem."
00:07:39.000,00:07:41.002,Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.
00:08:06.611,00:08:11.199,"I mean, these guys were hard-core hijackers, but there I was."
00:08:13.868,00:08:15.536,"At that point, I wasn't scared."
00:08:15.995,00:08:18.372,I knew I hadn't done anything they could do me for.
00:08:19.916,00:08:21.667,"Besides, it was fun."
00:08:22.210,00:08:23.961,I got to make like I was notorious.
00:08:27.173,00:08:31.469,"When your number is called, step forward and repeat the phrase you've been given. Understand?"
00:08:32.220,00:08:33.804,"Number one, step forward."
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.937,"Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker."
00:08:48.444,00:08:51.697,"Give me the fuckin' keys, you fuckin' cocksucker, motherfucker!"
00:08:51.948,00:08:53.616,Knock it off! Get back!
00:08:53.699,00:08:55.368,"Number three, step forward."
00:09:04.961,00:09:06.462,"Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
00:09:08.589,00:09:09.674,Excuse me?
00:09:12.301,00:09:14.679,"Hand me the fucking keys, you cocksucker. What the fuck?"
00:09:20.518,00:09:23.145,"Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker."
00:09:25.439,00:09:27.233,You don't put guys like that into a room together.
00:09:30.945,00:09:34.240,"Hand me the keys, you fucking cocksucker."
00:09:36.826,00:09:38.160,"for you guys, huh?"
00:09:39.912,00:09:42.915,Somebody was pissed about that truck getting hijacked and the cops had nothing.
00:09:43.374,00:09:46.085,They were hoping somebody would slip up and give them something to go on.
00:09:46.419,00:09:49.213,They knew we wouldn't fight it because they knew how to lean on us.
00:09:49.297,00:09:50.715,They've been doing it forever.
00:09:50.840,00:09:52.466,"I mean, our rights went right out the window."
00:09:52.550,00:09:54.385,"It was a violation. I mean, disgraceful."
00:09:54.468,00:09:56.053,They went after McManus first.
00:09:56.512,00:09:57.471,Top-notch entry man.
00:09:57.555,00:09:58.723,What truck?
00:10:01.350,00:10:02.351,Fucko?
00:10:08.232,00:10:09.859,You wanna know what your buddy Fenster told us?
00:10:10.318,00:10:12.111,-Say who? -McManus.
00:10:12.320,00:10:14.113,He told us another story altogether.
00:10:14.196,00:10:17.658,"Oh, is that the one about the hooker with the, uh, dysentery?"
00:10:21.037,00:10:23.956,"but when it came to the job, he was right on. A smart man."
00:10:25.583,00:10:26.834,I said he'll flip you.
00:10:27.168,00:10:28.544,-He'll what? -Flip you.
00:10:29.003,00:10:30.755,"-Flip you for real. -Yeah, I'm shaking."
00:10:31.088,00:10:32.423,-Come on. -Okay.
00:10:32.506,00:10:34.258,-Answer my question. -Can you hear me in the back?
00:10:38.137,00:10:39.555,I want my lawyer.
00:10:46.020,00:10:49.440,"Without a doubt, the one guy who didn't give a fuck about anybody."
00:10:49.815,00:10:52.068,You guys don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
00:10:53.694,00:10:55.905,I can put you in Queens on the night of the hijacking.
00:10:56.280,00:10:57.281,Really?
00:10:57.782,00:10:58.824,I live in Queens.
00:10:59.200,00:11:01.369,"Did you put that together yourself, Einstein?"
00:11:01.827,00:11:04.413,"What, you got a team of monkeys working around the clock on this?"
00:11:06.957,00:11:07.833,Uh...
00:11:09.627,00:11:11.879,Fuck your father in the shower and then have a snack.
00:11:11.962,00:11:13.381,"Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?"
00:11:13.589,00:11:15.216,I'll charge you when I'm ready.
00:11:15.299,00:11:16.384,With what?
00:11:19.303,00:11:22.181,"Keaton was the real prize for them, for obvious reasons."
00:11:22.264,00:11:24.600,"It was your mistake, not mine."
00:11:30.147,00:11:34.819,"Hmm? I mean, I've been walking around with the same face, the same, the same name."
00:11:36.529,00:11:37.780,I'm a businessman.
00:11:38.114,00:11:39.573,"Yeah, what's that? The restaurant business?"
00:11:40.449,00:11:43.744,"No. From now on, you're in the getting-fucked- by-us business."
00:11:44.286,00:11:46.414,"I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker."
00:11:46.747,00:11:52.128,"Like I said, it was your mistake, not mine."
00:11:52.753,00:11:57.258,"Now, you charge me with this shit and I'll beat it."
00:11:58.759,00:11:59.760,Okay?
00:12:01.178,00:12:02.888,"Let's get back to the truck, asshole."
00:12:06.767,00:12:10.020,"somebody gotta do something about this shit, getting hauled in every five minutes."
00:12:10.229,00:12:11.355,So I did a little time.
00:12:11.939,00:12:13.566,Does that mean I get railed every time...
00:12:16.527,00:12:17.445,Fuck 'em.
00:12:18.154,00:12:19.738,"Fenster, will you relax?"
00:12:20.531,00:12:22.241,These guys don't have any probable cause.
00:12:26.120,00:12:27.746,"You do some time, never let you go."
00:12:28.330,00:12:31.125,"You know, they treat me like a criminal, uh, uh..."
00:12:31.208,00:12:33.711,-I'll end up a criminal. -You are a criminal.
00:12:35.421,00:12:36.797,"Now, why'd you got to go and do that?"
00:12:38.257,00:12:39.300,Trying to make a point.
00:12:39.467,00:12:41.093,"Well, why don't you make your point?"
00:12:41.635,00:12:43.637,You're making me tired all over.
00:12:43.929,00:12:45.097,"Oh, fuck it, then."
00:12:48.225,00:12:49.477,"Well, you heard right."
00:12:55.107,00:12:57.026,Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
00:12:57.735,00:12:59.612,I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
00:13:01.071,00:13:03.616,She's a heavyweight criminal lawyer from uptown.
00:13:03.699,00:13:05.409,I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.
00:13:05.910,00:13:06.911,"How about it, Keaton?"
00:13:07.828,00:13:09.288,You a lawyer's wife?
00:13:10.498,00:13:11.874,What kind of retainer are you giving her?
00:13:12.374,00:13:13.209,Whoops!
00:13:15.836,00:13:16.962,do your friend a favor.
00:13:18.422,00:13:19.715,Tell him to keep quiet.
00:13:21.217,00:13:22.343,Dean Keaton.
00:13:24.178,00:13:25.262,"Gone clean, huh?"
00:13:26.347,00:13:27.723,Say it ain't so.
00:13:28.224,00:13:29.808,Or was it you that hit that truck?
00:13:31.810,00:13:32.937,Did you get to talk to your lawyer?
00:13:34.855,00:13:36.565,This whole thing was a shakedown.
00:13:36.982,00:13:38.067,What makes you say that?
00:13:38.442,00:13:39.568,How many times you been in a lineup?
00:13:41.529,00:13:43.197,It's always you and four dummies.
00:13:43.739,00:13:46.951,"The PD are paying homeless guys ten bucks a head, half the time."
00:13:47.284,00:13:50.037,And there's no way they'd line five felons in the same row.
00:13:50.120,00:13:52.456,No way. And what's a voice lineup?
00:13:52.748,00:13:54.458,A public defender could get you out of that one.
00:13:54.542,00:13:55.960,"So, why the hell was I strip-searched?"
00:13:56.377,00:13:57.461,It was the feds.
00:13:58.337,00:14:03.384,"A truckload of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on top of NYPD looking for answers."
00:14:03.467,00:14:04.510,They come up with us.
00:14:04.760,00:14:06.095,They're clutching at straws.
00:14:06.220,00:14:07.930,I had a guy's finger up my asshole tonight.
00:14:08.055,00:14:09.306,Is it Friday already?
00:14:11.433,00:14:12.601,"Yeah, lover boy."
00:14:12.768,00:14:15.145,You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.
00:14:16.063,00:14:18.732,So who in the goddamn piss hell stole that fucking truck?
00:14:22.319,00:14:23.654,Who stole the fucking truck?
00:14:23.904,00:14:25.239,I don't want to know.
00:14:25.406,00:14:26.991,"Who asked you, working man?"
00:14:27.116,00:14:29.201,"Fuck who did it. What I want to know is, who's the gimp?"
00:14:30.786,00:14:33.873,"Says you. How do I know that? What about it, pretzel man? What's your story?"
00:14:34.164,00:14:35.291,His name is Verbal.
00:14:36.375,00:14:37.459,Verbal Kint.
00:14:39.336,00:14:42.381,"Roger, really. People say I talk too much."
00:14:42.631,00:14:44.383,"Yeah, I was just going to tell you to shut up."
00:14:44.675,00:14:46.176,"We met before, once or twice."
00:14:46.343,00:14:48.178,In County. I was in for fraud.
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.598,"You were in a lineup then, too. What happened?"
00:14:50.806,00:14:51.640,I walked.
00:14:51.807,00:14:53.684,"Ninety days, suspended."
00:14:53.934,00:15:00.190,"-So you did it. -All right, now, look, we've all been put out by this whole thing, right?"
00:15:01.233,00:15:04.153,"So, I figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage a little dignity."
00:15:05.362,00:15:08.699,"Now, me and Fenster heard about a little job."
00:15:08.782,00:15:10.367,Why don't you just calm down?
00:15:10.993,00:15:12.494,What do you care what he has to say?
00:15:13.871,00:15:20.711,I'm just talking here and it seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants to hear what I got to say and I know Fenster's down.
00:15:22.254,00:15:23.547,"What about you, guy?"
00:15:25.466,00:15:26.717,"I'm interested, sure."
00:15:29.595,00:15:32.222,"So now, I'd like to exercise my right to free assembly."
00:15:32.765,00:15:34.183,Why don't you just shut up?
00:15:40.856,00:15:41.982,You're missing the point.
00:15:42.858,00:15:43.776,No.
00:15:45.110,00:15:46.153,You're missing the point.
00:15:47.488,00:15:49.406,I don't want to hear anything from you.
00:15:50.324,00:15:51.951,I don't care about your job.
00:15:54.036,00:15:59.249,"And, uh, I want nothing to do with any of you."
00:16:00.626,00:16:03.253,"I beg your pardon, but you can all go to hell."
00:16:08.258,00:16:09.718,gone the high road.
00:16:11.470,00:16:13.097,What is the world coming to?
00:16:18.519,00:16:19.645,Fuck him.
00:16:26.151,00:16:29.863,The five of us being brought in on a trumped-up charge to be leaned on by half-wits.
00:16:33.867,00:16:36.078,"Okay, now, I really can't talk about it much here."
00:16:40.124,00:16:45.921,"was that these men would never break, never lie down, never bend over for anybody."
00:16:47.339,00:16:48.382,Anybody.
00:16:57.558,00:17:05.649,"SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - PRESENT DAY Who are you?"
00:17:05.941,00:17:07.568,"Agent Jack Baer, FBI."
00:17:08.235,00:17:10.112,"-How many dead? -Fifteen, so far."
00:17:10.195,00:17:12.448,"They're still pulling some bodies out of the water, though."
00:17:13.198,00:17:15.200,"-Any survivors? -Yeah, there's two."
00:17:15.284,00:17:17.745,"One guy's in County hospital, but he's in a coma."
00:17:17.953,00:17:19.621,The DA has a second guy.
00:17:19.705,00:17:21.290,"A cripple from New York, I think."
00:17:21.373,00:17:23.625,"Listen, the Chief wants this place sealed off."
00:17:23.792,00:17:25.711,"If you have any questions, give him a call."
00:18:02.039,00:18:04.041,I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.
00:18:04.291,00:18:09.630,"If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin of the San Pedro Police Department at extension 112."
00:18:09.713,00:18:10.964,Have a nice day.
00:18:17.763,00:18:22.684,"the DA came down here last night ready to arraign, even before they moved him to County, okay?"
00:18:23.018,00:18:28.065,"Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later, the DA comes out of the office looking like the bogeyman smacked him around."
00:18:28.482,00:18:31.777,All right? They take a statement and they cut him a deal.
00:18:32.027,00:18:33.487,Did they charge him with anything?
00:18:33.612,00:18:35.823,"Yeah, weapons. Misdemeanor Two."
00:18:36.406,00:18:37.324,What is that?
00:18:38.492,00:18:41.954,"Listen, I give the DA credit for getting that much, you understand?"
00:18:42.037,00:18:43.163,"Excuse me, sir."
00:18:44.832,00:18:47.084,This whole thing has turned political.
00:18:47.167,00:18:49.795,"The Mayor was here last night, the Chief."
00:18:49.878,00:18:52.172,"This morning, the Governor called, okay?"
00:18:52.256,00:18:56.260,"I'm telling you, this guy is protected from up on high by the Prince of Darkness."
00:18:56.510,00:18:57.594,Take my word for it.
00:18:57.678,00:18:58.887,"Well, when does he post bail?"
00:18:59.096,00:19:00.347,"Maybe two hours, tops."
00:19:00.430,00:19:02.015,"-Well, I want to see him. -No, Dave."
00:19:02.099,00:19:06.019,"-Well, I gotta see him, Jeffrey. -Dave, no. I cannot-- Listen, you gotta do this for me."
00:19:06.103,00:19:07.437,I came a long way for this.
00:19:08.897,00:19:10.149,"Dave, please."
00:19:14.278,00:19:16.947,"Even if I let you talk to him, he won't talk to you."
00:19:18.282,00:19:20.033,He's paranoid about being recorded.
00:19:20.200,00:19:21.952,He knows the interrogation rooms are all wired.
00:19:22.995,00:19:24.413,This won't be an interrogation.
00:19:24.496,00:19:26.039,Just a friendly chat to kill some time.
00:19:26.123,00:19:28.167,He will not go into the interrogation room.
00:19:28.250,00:19:29.626,"-Then someplace else, then. -Where?"
00:19:32.421,00:19:33.964,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:19:34.047,00:19:35.841,"If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?"
00:19:35.924,00:19:37.593,"If it was a hit, who called it in?"
00:19:37.676,00:19:41.138,And I'm sure you have a host of wild theories to answer all these questions.
00:19:41.221,00:19:42.472,They know damn well what I think.
00:19:42.556,00:19:44.558,"That's crazy, and, besides, it doesn't even matter."
00:19:44.641,00:19:47.644,The guy's got total immunity. His story checks out.
00:19:47.728,00:19:49.646,He doesn't know what you want to know.
00:19:49.730,00:19:52.107,"I don't think he does, not exactly."
00:19:52.357,00:19:54.276,"But there's a lot more to his story, believe me."
00:19:54.651,00:20:02.826,"Jeffrey, look, I wanna know why 27 men died on that pier for what looks to be $91 million worth of dope that wasn't there."
00:20:03.660,00:20:06.997,"And above all, I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead."
00:20:07.539,00:20:08.707,"Uh, he's dead."
00:20:09.249,00:20:11.543,Come on. Two hours. Just till he makes bail.
00:20:12.753,00:20:13.837,They're all dead.
00:20:14.296,00:20:18.342,"I don't care how tough a guy you say this Keaton was, nobody on that boat could've come out alive."
00:20:22.804,00:20:23.805,Is he talking?
00:20:23.889,00:20:25.724,He regained consciousness less than an hour ago.
00:20:25.807,00:20:28.310,"He spoke, not English, then he lapsed."
00:20:28.393,00:20:29.603,-You think Hungarian? -I don't know.
00:20:29.686,00:20:30.646,I think that might've been what it was.
00:20:30.729,00:20:32.105,Yeah. Most of them were Hungarians.
00:20:32.356,00:20:33.315,"Here, you gotta put on one of these."
00:20:33.398,00:20:35.442,Burn victims are very susceptible to infection.
00:20:36.860,00:20:38.570,"And, of course, there's no smoking."
00:20:51.750,00:20:52.709,Is he gonna die?
00:20:53.085,00:20:56.171,"He has burns over 60% of his body, a number of his ribs were broken..."
00:20:56.255,00:20:58.340,"Call hospital security, get a man put on the door till the police get here."
00:20:58.465,00:20:59.508,Is he dangerous?
00:20:59.591,00:21:00.509,Yes.
00:21:00.801,00:21:01.802,Do it.
00:21:02.636,00:21:03.679,"Do it, now!"
00:21:07.182,00:21:09.476,"Joel? Yeah, Baer. Down at LA County."
00:21:09.643,00:21:13.605,"Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash."
00:21:14.106,00:21:15.565,"Yes. Yes, I'm sure."
00:21:16.066,00:21:17.609,"Well, no, no, he's all fucked up."
00:21:19.569,00:21:20.570,I can't hear you.
00:21:22.239,00:21:23.657,Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.
00:21:26.618,00:21:28.328,"Well, no, no. Not till I put a man on him."
00:21:28.412,00:21:30.080,"Listen, send me someone who can speak Hungarian."
00:21:31.123,00:21:32.958,"Yeah, he's awake. He's talking like a Thai hooker."
00:21:33.709,00:21:34.960,Keyser Soze.
00:21:36.420,00:21:38.463,-What? -Keyser Soze!
00:21:43.427,00:21:44.553,No shit?
00:21:46.346,00:21:52.311,"Joel, come in. Yeah. Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice, and find Dave Kujan from Customs. Mmm-hmm."
00:22:25.886,00:22:28.263,"Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs."
00:22:29.848,00:22:30.974,Nice to meet you.
00:22:31.767,00:22:33.727,He wants to ask you a few questions before you go.
00:22:33.977,00:22:34.936,What about?
00:22:35.604,00:22:37.064,"About a Dean Keaton, mostly."
00:22:38.857,00:22:40.859,But I'd like to start at the lineup back in New York.
00:22:41.026,00:22:42.486,Can I get some coffee?
00:22:42.569,00:22:44.780,In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.
00:22:44.863,00:22:48.075,I'm really thirsty. I used to dehydrate as a kid.
00:22:48.450,00:22:51.203,"One time, I got so bad my piss come out like snot. I'm not kidding."
00:22:51.286,00:22:53.121,-It was all thick and gooey-- -I'll get your fucking coffee.
00:22:53.747,00:22:55.290,"Get me one, too, while you're at it."
00:23:02.506,00:23:03.882,Tension is a killer.
00:23:04.549,00:23:07.344,"I used to be in a barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois."
00:23:07.552,00:23:10.180,"The baritone was this guy named Kip Diskin, big fat guy."
00:23:10.263,00:23:11.640,"I mean, like, orca fat."
00:23:11.723,00:23:13.183,"He was so stressed in the morning, you know."
00:23:13.266,00:23:14.976,"Verbal, you know we're trying to help you."
00:23:15.519,00:23:17.062,"Sure, and I appreciate that."
00:23:17.270,00:23:20.148,"And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops."
00:23:20.607,00:23:24.820,"I would've liked to have been a Fed myself, but my CP always-- Verbal, you're not telling us everything."
00:23:25.403,00:23:26.780,I know you know something.
00:23:34.287,00:23:35.747,I know you think he's a good man.
00:23:43.046,00:23:44.881,"Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit."
00:23:44.965,00:23:46.550,Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.
00:23:50.178,00:23:52.430,"Are you trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?"
00:23:53.723,00:23:54.975,I just wanna hear your story.
00:23:55.183,00:23:56.184,It's all there.
00:23:57.644,00:23:58.854,May I have a cigarette?
00:24:02.649,00:24:04.276,-According to your statement-- -I need a light.
00:24:08.697,00:24:12.826,"According to your statement, you're a short-con operator, run-of-the-mill..."
00:24:17.998,00:24:23.461,"According to your statement, you're a short-con operator, run-of-the-mill scams."
00:24:23.962,00:24:25.130,That's been suppressed.
00:24:25.213,00:24:26.590,Anything in there is inadmissible.
00:24:26.673,00:24:29.050,"Oh, I know. Sweet deal you have here."
00:24:29.134,00:24:30.260,Total immunity.
00:24:31.136,00:24:33.847,"Well, I do have the weapons charge."
00:24:34.347,00:24:36.641,I'm looking at six whole months' hard time.
00:24:36.725,00:24:38.685,"You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?"
00:24:40.353,00:24:42.397,You know a religious guy named John Paul?
00:24:42.522,00:24:43.899,You know Ruby's in Attica?
00:24:44.065,00:24:45.567,He didn't have my lawyer.
00:24:45.650,00:24:47.569,I know Ruby. He's big on respect.
00:24:47.652,00:24:49.446,"He's a good friend of mine, likes me very much."
00:24:50.155,00:24:53.116,"Now, I know your testimony is sealed. Ruby's well-connected."
00:24:53.200,00:24:55.118,"He's got lots of friends inside, do a lot of favors for him."
00:24:55.660,00:24:59.497,What do you think he would say if he found out you dropped his name to the DA?
00:25:00.123,00:25:01.750,There's nothing in there about Ruby.
00:25:01.958,00:25:03.501,I'll be sure to mention that to him.
00:25:03.710,00:25:05.295,"First thing on the job, you know what I learned?"
00:25:05.378,00:25:06.504,How to spot a murderer.
00:25:06.796,00:25:08.798,Let's say you arrest three guys for the same killing.
00:25:09.049,00:25:10.634,You put them all in jail overnight.
00:25:10.800,00:25:12.761,"The next morning, whoever's sleeping is your man."
00:25:13.094,00:25:14.387,"You see, if you're guilty, you know you're caught."
00:25:14.471,00:25:15.513,You get some rest.
00:25:15.597,00:25:17.474,You let your guard down. You follow me?
00:25:17.849,00:25:18.808,No.
00:25:19.392,00:25:20.769,Let me get right to the point.
00:25:22.520,00:25:29.236,"I'm smarter than you and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know and I'm gonna get it from you, whether you like it or not."
00:25:30.445,00:25:31.655,I'm not a rat.
00:25:38.078,00:25:39.079,Thanks.
00:25:42.499,00:25:43.458,Ah.
00:25:44.125,00:25:47.504,"Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee."
00:25:47.671,00:25:50.423,"Right off the trees, I mean. That was good."
00:25:50.757,00:25:53.051,"This is shit, but, hey, I'm in a police station."
00:25:53.134,00:25:54.386,Can we get started again?
00:25:54.678,00:25:56.471,"Now, what happened after the lineup?"
00:26:03.186,00:26:05.897,The desk sergeant was actually trying to tell me that he couldn't release you.
00:26:05.981,00:26:08.316,"I mean, can you believe that? You weren't even charged."
00:26:08.984,00:26:09.985,Damn police.
00:26:13.446,00:26:15.323,"You know, I don't wanna have pictures taken of your face."
00:26:15.865,00:26:17.701,I'll take them to the DA's office first thing in the morning.
00:26:17.867,00:26:19.828,-Forget about it. -Absolutely not.
00:26:19.911,00:26:21.871,I'm gonna have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
00:26:21.955,00:26:23.748,"Look, I don't want to talk about it, Edie, okay?"
00:26:26.793,00:26:28.545,"So, what did Fortier and Renault say?"
00:26:29.379,00:26:30.922,They asked for some more time to think about investing.
00:26:31.923,00:26:33.258,-Damn it. -More time. It's okay.
00:26:33.341,00:26:34.634,"More time for what, Edie?"
00:26:35.135,00:26:37.095,"No matter how you cover my tracks, they're still..."
00:26:37.178,00:26:38.805,They're still gonna find out about me.
00:26:38.888,00:26:40.181,Give me some credit.
00:26:40.640,00:26:42.017,I got you this far.
00:26:42.267,00:26:43.351,Let's go to the grand jury.
00:26:43.435,00:26:47.022,"You know, this isn't gonna stop if we don't-- It's never going to stop, period."
00:26:48.064,00:26:51.234,"By next week, every investor in the city is gonna be walking away from us."
00:26:55.238,00:26:56.281,I'm finished.
00:27:02.662,00:27:04.497,"Don't give up on me now, Dean."
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.084,It's never gonna stop.
00:27:15.884,00:27:17.052,I love you.
00:27:18.428,00:27:20.263,They ruined me in there tonight.
00:27:22.724,00:27:23.850,I love you.
00:27:25.685,00:27:26.811,Do you hear me?
00:27:33.860,00:27:34.778,What?
00:27:37.655,00:27:38.740,All right.
00:28:03.640,00:28:04.891,-Yeah. -Let's go.
00:28:10.522,00:28:13.149,"a fast-jump, high-risk, long money."
00:28:13.525,00:28:14.901,We all knew it could be done.
00:28:15.360,00:28:17.987,"The way I figured, to do it wrong meant killing."
00:28:18.321,00:28:20.532,To do it right took five men.
00:28:20.740,00:28:22.283,Five men meant Keaton.
00:28:23.660,00:28:25.245,Keaton took convincing.
00:28:28.373,00:28:30.208,New York's finest taxi service.
00:28:31.459,00:28:32.502,Bullshit.
00:28:33.503,00:28:34.546,Bullshit.
00:28:35.964,00:28:37.590,They don't operate anymore.
00:28:38.299,00:28:40.260,McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
00:28:40.343,00:28:42.178,"They're coming out for one job, Thursday."
00:28:42.470,00:28:45.306,They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America.
00:28:45.390,00:28:47.267,McManus already has a fence set to take the stuff.
00:28:47.350,00:28:48.435,A fence? Who?
00:28:48.685,00:28:50.186,"Some guy in California, his name is Redfoot."
00:28:50.270,00:28:51.396,I never heard of him.
00:28:51.896,00:28:53.189,You have to come.
00:28:53.398,00:28:54.941,What's it to you whether I do it or not?
00:28:55.024,00:28:57.569,"They don't, they don't know me. You do."
00:28:58.194,00:28:59.863,They won't take me unless you go.
00:29:00.822,00:29:02.115,Look at me. I need this.
00:29:03.324,00:29:05.368,"Oh, you're telling me you don't need this?"
00:29:05.618,00:29:08.455,"Is this your place? Look, I'm not knocking you."
00:29:08.538,00:29:10.331,You look like you got a good little scam going with this lawyer.
00:29:15.628,00:29:16.671,Sorry.
00:29:17.756,00:29:19.382,It's okay. It's okay.
00:29:20.925,00:29:22.844,You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
00:29:26.014,00:29:28.683,-You okay? -I was out of line.
00:29:30.310,00:29:32.353,"But they're never gonna stop with us, you know that."
00:29:33.271,00:29:35.815,"As clean as you could ever get, they'll never let you go now."
00:29:35.899,00:29:39.444,"This way, we hit the cops where it hurts and we get well in the meantime."
00:29:43.865,00:29:44.741,You're sure you're okay?
00:29:45.992,00:29:46.993,I'll be all right.
00:30:01.883,00:30:05.720,"Look, I, uh, -I sometimes get-- -Forget it."
00:30:10.058,00:30:11.601,I'll probably shit blood tonight.
00:30:23.321,00:30:28.535,"So, uh, how do they wanna do it?"
00:30:30.662,00:30:32.956,"McManus wants to go in shooting, I say no."
00:30:34.833,00:30:36.709,Fenster? Hockney?
00:30:37.377,00:30:39.462,They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything.
00:30:40.547,00:30:42.674,"Now, I got a way to do it without killing anyone."
00:30:42.757,00:30:45.051,"But like I say, they won't let me in without you."
00:31:03.945,00:31:04.988,Three million?
00:31:07.198,00:31:08.366,Maybe more.
00:31:13.162,00:31:14.205,No killing.
00:31:16.332,00:31:18.001,Not if we do it my way.
00:31:53.953,00:31:55.496,was not your normal taxi service.
00:31:55.580,00:32:01.961,"It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD that ran a high-profit racket, driving smugglers and drug dealers all over the city."
00:32:02.045,00:32:05.924,"For a few hundred dollars a mile, you got your own blue and white, and a police escort."
00:32:06.007,00:32:07.884,They even had their own business cards.
00:32:08.051,00:32:12.013,"After a while, somebody started asking questions and the taxi service shut down."
00:32:12.096,00:32:15.600,"Ever since then, Internal Affairs have been waiting to catch them in the act."
00:32:16.017,00:32:17.477,And that's where we came in.
00:32:19.395,00:32:20.521,Fuckin' great.
00:32:22.982,00:32:24.692,Will this get me to Staten Island?
00:32:26.319,00:32:28.571,You kidding me? This'll get you to Cape Cod.
00:32:30.865,00:32:36.079,"Fenster got the vans, Hockney supplied the hardware, I came through with how to do it so no one got killed."
00:32:36.245,00:32:37.330,But Keaton?
00:32:37.914,00:32:39.707,Keaton put on the finishing touch.
00:32:40.083,00:32:43.586,A little fuck you from the five of us to the NYPD.
00:32:49.425,00:32:50.468,"Careful, careful, careful!"
00:32:50.551,00:32:51.719,"Come on, asshole!"
00:32:55.807,00:32:57.350,"Don't move, you fucker!"
00:32:57.433,00:32:58.977,"Drop it now, motherfucker!"
00:32:59.060,00:33:00.979,Drop the fucking gun! Drop it!
00:33:01.062,00:33:02.271,Don't fucking move.
00:33:04.857,00:33:06.025,Put your fucking thing away.
00:33:06.109,00:33:07.902,"We're cops, you stupid assholes!"
00:33:08.569,00:33:10.905,"-Watch the glass! -Don't fucking move, motherfucker!"
00:33:13.199,00:33:14.158,Shut up!
00:33:14.659,00:33:15.868,"Oh, oh, oh!"
00:33:16.244,00:33:17.370,"Oh, fuck!"
00:33:21.040,00:33:23.292,"Afternoon, my little pork chops. Now give me the shit."
00:33:23.376,00:33:24.919,-Don't move! -Give him the fucking shit!
00:33:25.003,00:33:26.838,Give him the fucking thing! Give him the fucking thing!
00:33:27.130,00:33:28.798,"Give him the fucking shit, man!"
00:33:31.759,00:33:33.720,-Now the money. -There's no money.
00:33:33.803,00:33:35.346,"Give me the money right now, motherfucker!"
00:33:35.430,00:33:37.181,-There's no fucking money. -Give him the money right now!
00:33:37.265,00:33:38.433,Give me the fucking money!
00:33:38.808,00:33:40.143,Do it! Give him the money!
00:33:40.226,00:33:41.102,Give me the fucking money!
00:33:41.227,00:33:42.270,Give him the money!
00:33:42.353,00:33:43.604,Hurry up!
00:33:44.605,00:33:45.690,You know the fucking...
00:33:45.773,00:33:46.983,You know who the fuck I am?
00:33:47.066,00:33:49.527,You people know who the fuck I am? Fuck!
00:33:50.278,00:33:51.904,"We do now, jerk-off."
00:33:53.031,00:33:54.198,Cocksucker.
00:34:03.249,00:34:04.542,What the fuck was...
00:34:05.001,00:34:06.085,Holy shit!
00:34:09.172,00:34:10.923,"Go, go, go!"
00:34:25.313,00:34:27.648,The press was on the scene before the police were.
00:34:27.732,00:34:30.151,Strausz and Rizzi were indicted three days later.
00:34:30.234,00:34:32.987,"Within a few weeks, 50 more cops went down with them."
00:34:33.404,00:34:36.783,"Everybody got it right in the ass, from the Chief on down."
00:34:37.200,00:34:38.493,It was beautiful.
00:34:46.959,00:34:48.419,I owe you $2.50.
00:34:50.129,00:34:51.255,Dr. Keaton.
00:34:54.258,00:34:55.885,There's more here than I thought.
00:34:55.968,00:34:57.178,When's the fence coming?
00:34:58.179,00:35:00.973,"Redfoot never comes to see me, I always go to see him."
00:35:02.225,00:35:03.476,In California?
00:35:04.811,00:35:09.190,"Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I-- Wait, wait, wait. Hold the fucking phone."
00:35:09.649,00:35:12.026,"You and Fenster? No, no, no, no."
00:35:12.276,00:35:13.402,You fucking kidding me?
00:35:13.778,00:35:15.863,"Okay, so, then who's gonna go?"
00:35:16.697,00:35:17.824,We all go!
00:35:19.826,00:35:21.327,"What's your fucking problem, man?"
00:35:22.286,00:35:27.917,"My fucking problem, man, is that you and Fenster are off honeymooning in California, while the rest of us are sitting here holding our dicks."
00:35:28.000,00:35:30.211,Hey! The job's over.
00:35:31.254,00:35:32.171,Cool it.
00:35:33.256,00:35:35.550,LA's a good place to lie low for a while.
00:35:38.553,00:35:39.804,You wanna dance?
00:35:47.520,00:35:48.521,Ladies.
00:35:56.737,00:35:58.614,I would like to propose a toast.
00:35:59.907,00:36:01.075,There you go.
00:36:03.953,00:36:08.583,"To Mr. Verbal, the man with the plan."
00:36:25.183,00:36:27.435,"Don't do this. Send her a note, something."
00:36:28.853,00:36:30.271,I said we'll make it.
00:37:04.639,00:37:05.932,We're gonna miss the plane.
00:37:07.934,00:37:09.352,She'll understand.
00:37:29.288,00:37:31.457,That's heartwarming. Really.
00:37:33.709,00:37:34.877,I'm weepy.
00:37:36.170,00:37:37.713,"Jeff, you wanna wait outside?"
00:37:41.676,00:37:44.720,"You guys wanted to know what happened after the lineup, I'm telling you."
00:37:46.430,00:37:48.099,Who do you think you're talking to?
00:37:48.766,00:37:50.935,You expect me to believe that he retired?
00:37:52.228,00:37:53.437,For a woman?
00:37:55.606,00:37:58.442,Bullshit. Keaton was using her.
00:37:58.734,00:37:59.694,He loved her.
00:37:59.777,00:38:00.820,Sure.
00:38:02.321,00:38:04.532,that hitting the taxi service wasn't his idea either.
00:38:08.494,00:38:10.288,Who else would know the taxi service better?
00:38:10.371,00:38:11.914,That job had his name written all over on it.
00:38:13.541,00:38:16.877,"Let me tell you something, I know Dean Keaton."
00:38:17.044,00:38:19.714,I've been investigating him for the past three years.
00:38:20.047,00:38:22.341,The guy I know was a cold-blooded bastard.
00:38:23.092,00:38:26.887,IAD indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force.
00:38:27.471,00:38:29.432,"So, don't sell me the hooker with a heart of gold."
00:38:29.682,00:38:30.933,You got him all wrong.
00:38:32.143,00:38:33.227,Do I?
00:38:34.103,00:38:38.232,Dean Keaton was under indictment a total of seven times while he was on the force.
00:38:38.649,00:38:44.405,"In every case, witnesses either reversed their testimony to the grand jury or died before they could testify."
00:38:45.656,00:38:50.036,"When they finally did nail him for fraud, he spent five years in Sing Sing."
00:38:50.286,00:38:51.954,He killed three prisoners inside.
00:38:52.788,00:38:58.252,"Of course, I can't prove this, but I can't prove the best part either."
00:39:00.171,00:39:01.714,Dean Keaton was dead.
00:39:03.049,00:39:04.216,Did you know that?
00:39:04.550,00:39:11.307,He died in a fire two years ago during an investigation into the murder of a witness who was going to testify against him.
00:39:11.640,00:39:16.187,Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into a warehouse he owned just before it blew up.
00:39:16.771,00:39:19.190,They said he went in to check a leaking gas main.
00:39:20.775,00:39:23.652,It blew up and took all of Dean Keaton with it.
00:39:25.321,00:39:29.325,"Within three months of the explosion, the two witnesses, they were dead."
00:39:30.409,00:39:32.203,One killed himself in his car.
00:39:32.703,00:39:34.997,The other fell down an open elevator shaft.
00:39:40.378,00:39:41.337,"-Agent Baer? -Yeah, wait, just wait, hold on."
00:39:41.420,00:39:42.421,This is not what we discussed.
00:39:42.505,00:39:43.464,There are too many people in this room.
00:39:43.547,00:39:46.300,"Doctor, look. I promise we'll be out of here before he blows his porch light, okay?"
00:39:46.384,00:39:48.135,"-I have a noon meeting, Baer. -Yeah. Okay, look."
00:39:48.219,00:39:49.261,"Agent Baer, five minutes."
00:39:49.345,00:39:50.596,"Everyone just calm down, all right?"
00:39:50.930,00:39:53.808,I want you to ask this man about the shootout in the harbor.
00:40:06.195,00:40:08.614,-He says they were buying-- -Dope. We know.
00:40:15.204,00:40:17.289,"He doesn't know what they were buying, but not dope."
00:40:18.332,00:40:19.667,-People. -What?
00:40:27.925,00:40:29.176,He needs guarantees...
00:40:30.052,00:40:31.429,"What is he talking about, guarantees?"
00:40:31.554,00:40:32.596,He says his life's in danger.
00:40:34.849,00:40:37.893,"He saw the Devil, looked him in the eye."
00:40:38.352,00:40:40.563,"-I'm on my way. -No, no, no. Wait a minute."
00:40:40.980,00:40:44.984,Ask him to tell him what he told me about the Devil.
00:40:46.318,00:40:47.361,Who's the Devil?
00:40:53.117,00:40:54.535,Keyser Soze.
00:40:59.498,00:41:00.499,Keyser Soze?
00:41:01.000,00:41:03.669,"Yeah, he was in the harbor, killing many men."
00:41:04.503,00:41:06.088,He saw Keyser Soze?
00:41:12.636,00:41:14.054,He saw his face.
00:41:14.138,00:41:15.431,"All right. All right, look, okay?"
00:41:15.514,00:41:18.267,Tell him to tell her what he looks like.
00:41:18.559,00:41:19.977,-Describe him. -Okay.
00:41:29.236,00:41:32.114,telling me I can find Keaton eating at Mondino's with his attorney.
00:41:32.448,00:41:33.449,And there he is.
00:41:34.116,00:41:41.874,"Now, because he never profited from his alleged death, and because we convicted someone else of the murder we tried to pin on him, we had to let him go."
00:41:43.417,00:41:47.713,"He was dead just long enough for the murder rap to blow over, and then he had lunch."
00:41:48.839,00:41:50.174,I don't know about that.
00:41:50.799,00:41:51.884,"Oh, I don't think you do."
00:41:52.885,00:41:54.553,But you say you saw Keaton die.
00:41:55.513,00:41:58.224,"I think you're covering his ass, and he's still out there somewhere."
00:41:58.516,00:42:00.684,I think he's behind that whole circus at the harbor.
00:42:00.768,00:42:04.021,My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend.
00:42:04.480,00:42:06.232,"You tell me he's dead, so be it."
00:42:07.816,00:42:09.902,I wanna be sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
00:42:09.985,00:42:12.154,"He wasn't behind anything, it was the lawyer."
00:42:13.405,00:42:16.700,"What lawyer? What lawyer, Verbal?"
00:42:16.784,00:42:21.997,"You know, back when I was in that barbershop quartet in Skokie, Illinois-- You don't think that I know you held out on the DA?"
00:42:22.248,00:42:23.791,What did you leave out of that testimony?
00:42:24.041,00:42:26.252,I could be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
00:42:26.335,00:42:28.796,-The DA gave me immunity. -Not from me.
00:42:29.213,00:42:31.423,"You get no immunity from me, you piece of shit."
00:42:31.632,00:42:38.973,"Every criminal I have put in prison, every cop that owes me a favor, every creep and scumbag that walks the street for a living will know the name of Verbal Kint."
00:42:39.306,00:42:46.397,"Now, you talk to me or that precious immunity they seem so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on."
00:42:49.525,00:42:50.776,There was a lawyer.
00:42:52.444,00:42:53.612,Kobayashi.
00:42:55.072,00:42:56.407,Is he the one that killed Keaton?
00:42:56.532,00:42:59.451,No. But I'm sure Keaton is dead.
00:43:00.327,00:43:01.370,Convince me.
00:43:02.538,00:43:04.123,And tell me every last detail.
00:43:28.522,00:43:29.857,He had a good reputation.
00:43:30.441,00:43:31.650,Seemed like a good guy.
00:43:32.443,00:43:34.153,"Still, we should have known better."
00:43:34.445,00:43:35.279,How you doing?
00:43:35.404,00:43:36.488,Good. You?
00:43:36.655,00:43:38.282,Not bad. Can't complain.
00:43:39.283,00:43:40.451,"How's it going, Fenster?"
00:43:42.202,00:43:43.370,"Don't need to open it, right?"
00:43:49.960,00:43:51.086,You must be Keaton.
00:43:52.755,00:43:54.381,"Redfoot, Dean Keaton."
00:43:54.923,00:43:56.592,Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
00:43:56.675,00:43:58.552,"Verbal, the man with the plan, huh?"
00:43:59.803,00:44:01.180,You guys interested in any more work?
00:44:02.389,00:44:03.641,We're always looking for extra work.
00:44:03.724,00:44:04.683,We're on vacation.
00:44:05.267,00:44:07.770,"Oh, well, that's too bad."
00:44:08.854,00:44:10.898,I got a ton of work and I don't have any good people.
00:44:11.315,00:44:13.108,-Not like you guys. -What's the job?
00:44:13.567,00:44:15.611,There's this jeweler out of Texas named Saul.
00:44:16.362,00:44:18.614,He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.
00:44:18.781,00:44:20.532,He does free appraisals for people.
00:44:20.616,00:44:22.326,"Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't."
00:44:22.534,00:44:24.912,"Anyway, the word is, he carries around a lot of cash."
00:44:25.913,00:44:29.541,"So I figure, I keep the merchandise, you keep the green."
00:44:30.084,00:44:31.085,Simple.
00:44:31.502,00:44:32.753,What about security?
00:44:32.836,00:44:35.130,"Couple of bodyguards, nothing you couldn't handle."
00:44:38.384,00:44:39.885,"I expect nothing less from you, man."
00:44:42.054,00:44:43.389,Good to see you. We'll call you.
00:44:43.472,00:44:44.473,"-Good to see you, too. -All right."
00:44:44.556,00:44:46.392,"Enjoy LA, huh? Get yourself laid."
00:44:47.309,00:44:48.352,Hey.
00:44:51.939,00:44:55.734,A friend of mine in New York tells me that you knew Spook Hollis.
00:44:56.985,00:44:59.363,"The way I hear it, you did time with old Spook."
00:45:00.072,00:45:01.198,"Good man, wasn't he?"
00:45:02.199,00:45:03.659,I used to run dope for him.
00:45:04.868,00:45:06.078,Too bad he got shivved.
00:45:06.161,00:45:07.162,Yeah.
00:45:09.164,00:45:10.124,I shivved him.
00:45:12.876,00:45:15.504,Better you hear it from me now than from somebody else later.
00:45:17.714,00:45:19.007,I appreciate that.
00:45:20.926,00:45:25.556,"Just out of curiosity, was it business or personal?"
00:45:27.975,00:45:29.059,Bit of both.
00:45:30.936,00:45:34.857,"Well, like I said, you give me a call if you're interested, all right?"
00:45:40.028,00:45:41.196,Is there a problem?
00:45:43.615,00:45:46.243,One job. That was the deal.
00:45:56.378,00:45:57.504,One job?
00:45:59.298,00:46:00.507,"That's a good one, Keaton."
00:46:05.304,00:46:07.264,but a man can't change what he is.
00:46:07.347,00:46:10.100,"He can convince anyone he's someone else, but never himself."
00:46:10.392,00:46:13.520,It took one day with McManus nagging and we went back to work.
00:46:31.371,00:46:34.917,I look in the backseat of the other car and this woman's totally naked.
00:46:35.000,00:46:36.543,I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe.
00:46:39.838,00:46:41.089,Stay right there! There we go!
00:46:42.508,00:46:44.009,There's a second one here somewhere.
00:46:49.765,00:46:51.266,Give me the fucking case!
00:46:58.065,00:46:59.316,Give me the fucking case.
00:46:59.566,00:47:01.026,I'm telling you for the last time.
00:47:01.610,00:47:03.278,Give me the fucking case!
00:47:46.071,00:47:47.322,"Look, just hand over the case."
00:47:48.574,00:47:50.033,Hand over the fucking case.
00:48:16.935,00:48:18.562,-Come on! -Bad day.
00:48:18.812,00:48:20.188,"-Come on, let's go! -Fuck it."
00:48:20.272,00:48:21.398,Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
00:48:46.131,00:48:47.049,Fuck.
00:48:59.061,00:49:00.604,"Guys, come on."
00:49:02.022,00:49:03.190,What are you doing?
00:49:03.273,00:49:04.816,What's it look like I'm doing? I'm gonna kill him.
00:49:04.900,00:49:06.818,"Look, we did it your way, now we're gonna do it my way."
00:49:06.902,00:49:08.695,-Are you gonna kill him? -I'm gonna deal with him.
00:49:08.862,00:49:09.863,"Yeah, you better deal with him."
00:49:10.989,00:49:12.032,Shut up.
00:49:19.289,00:49:20.749,What am I supposed to do with that?
00:49:22.042,00:49:23.502,"I don't know, feed it to the gimp."
00:49:23.794,00:49:25.295,Ease his pain. I don't know what that is.
00:49:25.379,00:49:26.672,-What do you mean you don't know? -Shut up.
00:49:26.755,00:49:27.881,I don't know.
00:49:28.090,00:49:29.508,I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
00:49:29.591,00:49:30.717,"Yeah, who?"
00:49:30.926,00:49:32.469,"I don't know, some limey."
00:49:33.220,00:49:35.013,"He's a middleman for somebody, okay?"
00:49:35.263,00:49:36.890,"He doesn't say, I don't ask."
00:49:36.973,00:49:38.225,You're fucking full of shit.
00:49:38.517,00:49:39.393,-Fuck you. -Fuck you.
00:49:39.476,00:49:40.435,Listen to me.
00:49:41.353,00:49:42.729,"We wanna meet him, okay?"
00:49:43.563,00:49:44.606,That's funny.
00:49:45.941,00:49:48.360,"He called me last night, he says he wants to meet you guys."
00:49:49.986,00:49:51.947,"Okay, we'll meet him."
00:49:52.239,00:49:53.198,-I'll call you. -Good.
00:49:53.281,00:49:55.075,"-Do that. No problem. -I don't like it, Dean."
00:49:55.158,00:49:56.535,I don't like it. Wait a minute.
00:49:56.618,00:49:57.911,"One more thing, tough guy."
00:49:58.328,00:50:00.122,"Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you."
00:50:02.624,00:50:04.084,"You're such a tough guy, McManus."
00:50:04.376,00:50:06.753,"But do me a favor, all right? Get the fuck off my dick."
00:50:06.837,00:50:07.838,Fuck!
00:50:07.921,00:50:09.339,"Don't, don't."
00:50:14.636,00:50:17.597,"You know, it's an awful shame about Saul getting whacked."
00:50:18.515,00:50:20.600,Cops are gonna be looking for the guys who did it.
00:50:21.852,00:50:24.187,Sooner or later they're gonna come around asking me.
00:50:26.898,00:50:28.191,"You have a sweet night, ladies."
00:50:32.654,00:50:33.697,Fuck you.
00:50:40.495,00:50:42.873,-So this lawyer... -Kobayashi.
00:50:44.082,00:50:45.876,-Came from Redfoot. -Right.
00:50:46.918,00:50:49.004,And why leave this out when you talked to the DA?
00:50:49.588,00:50:51.214,"Dave, someone to see you."
00:50:54.926,00:50:55.886,Jack.
00:50:57.387,00:50:58.764,I've been looking all over for you.
00:50:59.556,00:51:02.309,You still after that coke that took a walk out of that bloodbath in the harbor yesterday?
00:51:02.392,00:51:03.977,"-Yeah. -Well, you can stop looking."
00:51:04.311,00:51:05.479,There was no coke.
00:51:06.188,00:51:11.026,I've been in LA County talking to a guy they pulled out of a drainpipe in San Pedro yesterday after the shootout.
00:51:11.651,00:51:13.403,"He came to this morning, he started talking."
00:51:13.695,00:51:19.451,"He's part of a Hungarian mob there to do a deal with a bunch of gwats from Argentina, and he says it was definitely not a dope deal."
00:51:19.659,00:51:20.911,-But the 91 million... -Yeah. We know.
00:51:21.036,00:51:22.829,But our man says no way on the dope.
00:51:23.121,00:51:26.708,This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.
00:51:26.792,00:51:30.086,They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
00:51:30.670,00:51:32.631,-What's the money for? -He didn't know.
00:51:32.714,00:51:35.425,No one doing the deal knew except for a few key people.
00:51:35.634,00:51:37.677,"They were all very hush about it, he says."
00:51:38.220,00:51:40.639,"Whatever it was, it was very sensitive."
00:51:40.847,00:51:41.973,I don't get it.
00:51:42.599,00:51:44.601,They tell me you got the cripple in there from New York?
00:51:44.851,00:51:46.353,-Yeah. -Did he mention Keyser Soze?
00:51:46.561,00:51:47.521,Who?
00:51:48.522,00:51:49.856,Just bear with me here.
00:51:52.025,00:51:54.569,"-Who's Keyser Soze? -Oh, fuck."
00:51:55.779,00:51:58.406,We've been going over this for an hour and a half.
00:51:59.324,00:52:01.535,"What we need to do is find Redfoot, Keaton..."
00:52:01.618,00:52:03.203,"-Listen. -...and get the hell out of here, now."
00:52:03.286,00:52:04.746,What we need to do is think.
00:52:05.497,00:52:06.498,Think back.
00:52:08.250,00:52:14.506,"Somebody with power, somebody who was capable of tracking us from New York to Los Angeles."
00:52:14.589,00:52:16.424,"Come on, Dean, what the hell are we doing here?"
00:52:16.508,00:52:17.509,We're waiting.
00:52:18.260,00:52:19.094,"-Sit down. -Bye, now."
00:52:19.177,00:52:20.387,-Sit down. -No.
00:52:20.804,00:52:22.264,It's hot and I'm fucking bored.
00:52:24.641,00:52:25.767,Mr. Keaton.
00:52:26.601,00:52:30.438,"Mr. Fenster I recognize from his mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus."
00:52:30.897,00:52:35.610,"I can only assume that you are Mr. Kint, the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg."
00:52:35.986,00:52:39.531,"My employer sends his gratitude, a most unexpected benefit."
00:52:40.574,00:52:42.117,I am Mr. Kobayashi.
00:52:42.701,00:52:47.038,I have been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.
00:52:47.414,00:52:48.373,What do you want?
00:52:48.456,00:52:50.792,"My employer requires your services, gentlemen."
00:52:52.752,00:52:56.089,"One job, one day's work. Very dangerous."
00:52:56.590,00:53:04.347,"He does not expect all of you to live, but those of you who do will have $91 million to divide between you in any way you see fit."
00:53:04.431,00:53:05.307,Who's your boss?
00:53:08.018,00:53:09.728,I work for Keyser Soze.
00:53:21.156,00:53:22.407,Who's Keyser Soze?
00:53:22.490,00:53:27.537,"Judging by the sudden change in mood, Mr. Kint, I feel sure the rest of your associates can tell you."
00:53:28.079,00:53:30.832,I come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze.
00:53:31.124,00:53:32.834,"An order, actually."
00:53:32.918,00:53:34.753,"What do you mean, an order?"
00:53:35.128,00:53:40.467,"In 1981, Mr. Keaton, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo, New York."
00:53:40.759,00:53:48.266,"The cargo was raw steel, steel which belonged to Mr. Soze and which was destined for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor."
00:53:48.767,00:53:51.853,A most profitable violation of UN Regulations.
00:53:51.937,00:53:58.485,"You had no way of knowing this, Mr. Keaton, because the fellow shipping the steel was working for Mr. Soze without his knowledge."
00:53:59.194,00:54:05.784,"Earlier this year, Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a two-prop cargo flight out of Newark airport."
00:54:05.867,00:54:10.205,The plane was carrying gold and platinum wiring also set for Pakistan.
00:54:10.664,00:54:16.461,"Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through Queens."
00:54:16.795,00:54:20.298,Gun parts which were set to be destroyed by the state of New York.
00:54:20.799,00:54:24.302,They were to be lost in a way station and rerouted to Belfast.
00:54:24.511,00:54:27.597,"Again, Mr. Soze using pawns who had no knowledge."
00:54:27.931,00:54:30.183,Which brings us to Mr. Kint.
00:54:31.309,00:54:40.235,"Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's less-than-intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence scam by a cripple."
00:54:41.111,00:54:43.405,"He was relieved of $62,000."
00:54:44.239,00:54:46.825,"Now, it has taken us some time to find you."
00:54:47.450,00:54:51.371,Our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in New York.
00:54:51.538,00:54:53.540,-You set up the lineup. -Yes.
00:54:53.748,00:54:56.084,You were not to be released until I had come to see you.
00:54:56.292,00:55:03.091,"It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Miss Finneran, was a little too effective in expediting his release."
00:55:03.299,00:55:05.260,Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
00:55:05.385,00:55:06.594,What about Redfoot?
00:55:06.678,00:55:08.013,Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.
00:55:08.513,00:55:12.726,Mr. Soze rarely works with the same people for very long and they never know who they're working for.
00:55:14.102,00:55:17.063,One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
00:55:17.939,00:55:20.150,"So, why are you telling us?"
00:55:20.608,00:55:24.154,"Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze, Mr. Fenster."
00:55:24.654,00:55:25.572,All of you.
00:55:25.947,00:55:29.743,That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive.
00:55:29.993,00:55:31.369,He feels you owe him.
00:55:31.911,00:55:33.830,You will repay your debt.
00:55:34.205,00:55:36.499,"All right, fuck the debt, and fuck you."
00:55:36.583,00:55:38.334,How do we know you work for Soze?
00:55:38.626,00:55:41.296,"I don't think that is very relevant, Mr. Hockney."
00:55:41.504,00:55:46.009,All five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.
00:55:46.176,00:55:50.555,Mr. Redfoot can testify to your involvement and we can see to it that he will.
00:55:50.638,00:55:51.848,What's your point?
00:55:52.182,00:55:57.812,"The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr. Soze's primary interest is narcotics."
00:55:58.396,00:56:03.651,"He has been competing, shall we say, with a group of Argentineans for several years, now."
00:56:03.777,00:56:06.446,Competing with Mr. Soze has taken its toll.
00:56:07.405,00:56:13.870,These Argentineans are negotiating the sale of $91 million in cocaine in three days' time.
00:56:14.329,00:56:19.751,"Needless to say, this purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength of their organization."
00:56:20.710,00:56:23.922,Mr. Soze would like you to stop the deal.
00:56:25.381,00:56:27.550,"Now, if you choose, you may wait until after the buy."
00:56:28.009,00:56:30.136,Whatever money changes hands is yours.
00:56:31.513,00:56:36.017,Mr. Soze would like you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board.
00:56:37.018,00:56:40.939,And then you will be free of your obligations to Mr. Soze.
00:56:43.316,00:56:46.486,You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.
00:56:48.780,00:56:50.907,A gift from Mr. Soze.
00:56:54.494,00:56:55.787,"Good day, gentlemen."
00:58:05.482,00:58:08.735,"They got my whole life in here, everything I've ever done since I was 18."
00:58:09.110,00:58:10.778,They fucking know everything.
00:58:11.362,00:58:13.448,Everybody I've ever worked with or did time with.
00:58:28.671,00:58:29.589,No.
00:58:31.716,00:58:32.884,This isn't right.
00:58:34.302,00:58:36.221,Who's that guy used to talk about Soze in New York?
00:58:38.848,00:58:40.058,Bricks Marlin.
00:58:40.350,00:58:42.769,"Yeah, he did jobs for him, indirect stuff."
00:58:43.770,00:58:46.648,And he said he always made five times more money on it than the job was worth.
00:58:48.066,00:58:49.651,This guy's a pipe dream.
00:58:49.901,00:58:52.278,Kobayashi's using him for window dressing.
00:58:52.612,00:58:54.447,I don't know. This is bad.
00:58:54.822,00:58:56.032,"No, it's bullshit."
00:58:56.115,00:58:58.326,This guy could be LAPD. It's a fucking setup.
00:58:59.494,00:59:02.247,"The way I hear it, Soze's some kind of butcher."
00:59:02.705,00:59:05.166,"A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher."
00:59:05.250,00:59:07.126,There is no Keyser Soze!
00:59:09.837,00:59:11.256,Who is Keyser Soze?
00:59:12.715,00:59:14.175,He's supposed to be Turkish.
00:59:14.384,00:59:15.885,Some say his father was German.
00:59:16.427,00:59:18.096,Nobody ever believed he was real.
00:59:18.930,00:59:24.978,"Nobody ever knew him or saw anybody that ever worked directly for him, but to hear Kobayashi tell it, anybody could have worked for Soze."
00:59:25.186,00:59:27.564,You never knew. That was his power.
00:59:28.898,00:59:34.862,The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.
00:59:36.990,00:59:41.244,"One story the guys told me, the story I believe, was from his days in Turkey."
00:59:41.619,00:59:44.205,There was a gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob.
00:59:44.497,00:59:49.419,"They realized that to be in power, you didn't need guns or money or even numbers."
00:59:49.502,00:59:52.964,You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't.
00:59:53.172,00:59:56.467,"After a while, they come into power and then they come after Soze."
00:59:56.634,00:59:59.178,"He was small-time then. Just running dope, they say."
01:00:02.724,01:00:06.644,They come to his home in the afternoon looking for his business.
01:00:06.936,01:00:10.315,They find his wife and kids in the house and decide to wait for Soze.
01:00:31.210,01:00:36.382,"The Hungarians knew Soze was tough, not to be trifled with, so they let him know they meant business."
01:00:41.929,01:00:45.141,"They tell him they want his territory, all his business."
01:00:45.600,01:00:54.692,"Soze looks over the faces of his family, then he showed these men of will what will really was."
01:01:17.298,01:01:19.425,than live another day after this.
01:01:21.135,01:01:27.725,"He lets the last Hungarian go, waits until his wife and kids are in the ground and then he goes after the rest of the mob."
01:01:28.142,01:01:32.939,"He kills their kids, he kills their wives, he kills their parents and their parents' friends."
01:01:33.690,01:01:38.277,He burns down the houses they live in and the stores they work in.
01:01:39.237,01:01:45.910,"He kills people that owe them money. And like that, he's gone, underground."
01:01:45.993,01:01:48.538,Nobody's ever seen him since. He becomes a myth.
01:01:48.705,01:01:51.833,A spook story that criminals tell their kids at night.
01:01:51.916,01:01:54.877,"Rat on your pop, and Keyser Soze will get you."
01:01:55.920,01:01:57.505,And no one ever really believes.
01:01:58.131,01:01:59.298,"Do you believe in him, Verbal?"
01:02:02.802,01:02:07.598,"Keaton always said, I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him."
01:02:10.184,01:02:16.023,"Well, I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze."
01:02:23.489,01:02:24.574,You give any weight to this?
01:02:25.575,01:02:27.577,I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser from Justice.
01:02:27.869,01:02:29.787,He's got a file on Soze in DC.
01:02:29.912,01:02:34.751,Been a hobby of his for a couple of years. A lot of guys equate him to that reporter on The Incredible Hulk.
01:02:40.548,01:02:42.341,"-You've heard of him? -What, on the street?"
01:02:42.550,01:02:45.595,"-Yeah. -Yeah, a few times. You know, outside stuff."
01:02:46.512,01:02:50.391,Somebody working for a guy who worked for a guy who got some money from Keyser Soze.
01:02:50.475,01:02:51.517,"You know, shit like that."
01:02:53.060,01:02:54.187,"You know, it could be an old badge."
01:02:54.270,01:02:55.438,"You know, a hex sign."
01:02:55.521,01:02:58.191,Keep people from fucking with you back when a name used to mean something.
01:02:58.274,01:02:59.484,But you're here.
01:02:59.692,01:03:04.071,"Well, shit, yeah. I got a guy trying to walk out of a hospital on a fried drumstick because he's afraid of Soze."
01:03:05.239,01:03:06.616,"Yeah, I'll run it up the flagpole."
01:03:09.035,01:03:10.161,I came clean.
01:03:10.244,01:03:11.496,I told it like it happened on the boat.
01:03:11.579,01:03:13.039,So what if I left out how I got there?
01:03:13.372,01:03:16.417,"It's so full of holes, the DA would've told me to blow Amnesty out my ass."
01:03:16.626,01:03:18.669,"So you got what you wanted out of me, so big fucking deal."
01:03:18.753,01:03:20.171,So that's why you never told the DA?
01:03:20.254,01:03:21.672,"Well, you tell me, Agent Kujan."
01:03:21.964,01:03:25.218,"If I told you the Loch Ness monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?"
01:03:25.301,01:03:27.428,"Turn State's evidence. We'll put you on the stand, we'll hear it out."
01:03:27.512,01:03:28.638,I've got immunity now.
01:03:28.721,01:03:30.223,What can you possibly offer me?
01:03:30.306,01:03:33.059,"Well, if there really is a Keyser Soze, he's gonna come looking for you."
01:03:34.143,01:03:35.812,"Where's your head, Agent Kujan?"
01:03:36.270,01:03:37.855,Where do you think the pressure's coming from?
01:03:38.022,01:03:41.317,"Keyser Soze, or whatever you wanna call him, he knows where I am right now."
01:03:41.400,01:03:45.363,He's got the front burner under your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later.
01:03:45.738,01:03:47.657,Immunity was just a deal with you assholes.
01:03:47.824,01:03:49.575,I got a whole new problem when I post bail.
01:03:49.742,01:03:51.869,So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
01:03:52.370,01:03:54.038,"Oh, gee. Thanks, Dave."
01:03:54.121,01:03:56.833,"Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion."
01:03:56.916,01:03:58.793,You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.
01:03:59.043,01:04:03.005,The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are now bailing me out? Fuck you.
01:04:05.800,01:04:07.844,You think you can catch Keyser Soze?
01:04:08.553,01:04:12.640,You think a guy like that comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out?
01:04:13.391,01:04:15.685,"If he comes up for anything, it'll be to get rid of me."
01:04:16.519,01:04:20.815,"After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again."
01:04:43.129,01:04:44.422,What happened next?
01:04:45.298,01:04:47.550,We woke up the next morning and Fenster was gone.
01:04:48.050,01:04:50.386,He couldn't handle the idea of slumming for Soze.
01:04:50.803,01:04:54.849,He left us a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.
01:04:55.600,01:04:56.642,Then what?
01:04:56.851,01:04:58.394,"Well, McManus was furious."
01:04:58.603,01:05:00.855,He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out.
01:05:00.938,01:05:02.148,All sorts of shit.
01:05:03.649,01:05:05.026,"That night, we got the call."
01:05:05.902,01:05:07.069,What call?
01:05:07.403,01:05:09.530,Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
01:05:21.959,01:05:23.002,We gotta bury him.
01:05:23.461,01:05:26.505,-With what? -With our hands.
01:05:38.434,01:05:40.478,"It's dry fucking sand, McManus."
01:05:40.561,01:05:43.731,"When he rots, the surfers are gonna smell him a mile away."
01:05:45.274,01:05:46.400,"Keaton, what are we gonna do?"
01:05:46.484,01:05:48.152,This fucking guy is gonna kill us.
01:05:49.695,01:05:51.322,I got no problem with that.
01:05:52.949,01:05:55.743,Kobayashi doesn't seem to have a problem with it either.
01:05:57.078,01:05:59.830,"You run, and we're gonna be digging a hole for you."
01:05:59.914,01:06:00.957,You got that?
01:06:01.916,01:06:03.376,This ain't my boy we're burying.
01:06:04.335,01:06:05.461,I don't owe anybody!
01:06:06.128,01:06:07.463,So fuck you.
01:06:07.755,01:06:09.507,He was my partner for five years.
01:06:10.216,01:06:14.762,We did more jobs and I saw more money than you can ever count. So fuck you!
01:06:15.721,01:06:18.391,-'Cause now it's payback! -It's not payback!
01:06:21.894,01:06:23.104,It's precaution.
01:06:23.604,01:06:25.564,You want payback? You wanna run? I don't care.
01:06:29.568,01:06:31.278,I'm not doing this for Fenster.
01:06:32.530,01:06:33.990,I'm not doing it for you.
01:06:35.992,01:06:37.368,I'm doing this for me.
01:06:39.662,01:06:41.372,I'm gonna finish this thing.
01:06:42.248,01:06:45.209,This Kobayashi bastard is not gonna stand on me.
01:07:11.277,01:07:12.611,Why didn't you say anything?
01:07:12.945,01:07:15.364,"Believe me, I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it."
01:07:15.573,01:07:17.074,It was too far-fetched for him.
01:07:17.575,01:07:19.952,"Keaton was a grounded guy, an ex-cop."
01:07:20.119,01:07:23.122,"To a cop, the explanation is never that complicated."
01:07:23.205,01:07:24.415,It's always simple.
01:07:24.749,01:07:27.710,"There's no mystery to the street, no arch-criminal behind it all."
01:07:27.793,01:07:30.921,"If you got a dead body and you think his brother did it, you're gonna find out you're right."
01:07:31.005,01:07:32.465,Nobody argued with Keaton.
01:07:32.548,01:07:34.467,They just set their minds to whacking Kobayashi.
01:07:45.519,01:07:46.645,They're coming up.
01:07:50.816,01:07:52.193,He's on his way down.
01:08:51.252,01:08:52.670,Press 20. Do it now.
01:09:13.315,01:09:14.233,Move.
01:09:17.987,01:09:18.946,The answer is no.
01:09:19.864,01:09:21.407,Mr. Soze will be most upset.
01:09:21.490,01:09:23.409,"Listen, you cocksucker, there is no Keyser Soze."
01:09:23.492,01:09:25.286,"You mention his name again, and I'll kill you right now."
01:09:25.369,01:09:26.871,"A strange threat, Mr. Keaton."
01:09:26.954,01:09:29.165,I can only assume that you've come here to kill me anyway.
01:09:35.129,01:09:40.009,"We know that you can get to us, but now you know that we can get to you."
01:09:41.802,01:09:44.054,I'm giving you one last chance to call this off.
01:09:44.638,01:09:45.472,Mr. So...
01:09:46.348,01:09:48.058,My employer has made up his mind.
01:09:48.350,01:09:49.435,He does not change it.
01:09:50.019,01:09:51.020,Neither do we.
01:09:53.355,01:09:56.275,"but you won't be able to get all of us, not before one of us gets through to you."
01:09:56.692,01:10:00.070,"I believe you, Mr. McManus. I most sincerely do."
01:10:00.988,01:10:02.865,"You would not have been chosen, were you not so suitable."
01:10:03.908,01:10:05.409,But I cannot make this decision.
01:10:06.035,01:10:13.000,Whatever you threaten me with is ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if I do not carry out my orders in full.
01:10:20.883,01:10:22.468,I'm the guy that's gonna get you.
01:10:25.054,01:10:26.931,I just wanted you to know that.
01:10:28.015,01:10:30.184,"I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus."
01:10:30.684,01:10:36.941,"I implore you, Mr. Keaton, believe me, Mr. Soze is very real and very determined."
01:10:37.024,01:10:37.942,We'll see.
01:10:45.824,01:10:52.706,"Before you do me in, Mr. McManus, you will let me finish my business with Miss Finneran first, won't you?"
01:10:58.712,01:10:59.797,What did you say?
01:11:01.215,01:11:02.633,Edie Finneran.
01:11:03.050,01:11:08.013,She's upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition.
01:11:08.931,01:11:11.392,I requested she be put on the case personally.
01:11:11.892,01:11:13.143,She flew in yesterday.
01:11:15.604,01:11:16.647,No matter.
01:11:17.481,01:11:19.066,"Kill away, Mr. McManus."
01:11:24.071,01:11:25.030,You're lying.
01:11:26.156,01:11:27.157,Am I?
01:11:44.633,01:11:47.761,Miss Finneran's escort while she's here in Los Angeles.
01:11:48.554,01:11:50.097,Never leaves her side for a moment.
01:11:50.472,01:11:52.933,I thought you would be glad to know she's in good hands.
01:11:57.604,01:11:58.731,"Now, get some rest."
01:11:58.814,01:12:00.524,The boat will be ready for you on Friday.
01:12:00.607,01:12:08.032,"If I see you or any of your friends before then, Ms. Finneran will find herself the victim of a most gruesome violation before she dies."
01:12:08.198,01:12:14.079,"As indeed will your father, Mr. Hockney, and your Uncle Randall in Arizona, Mr. Kint."
01:12:15.164,01:12:18.375,"I might only castrate Mr. McManus' nephew, David."
01:12:21.378,01:12:22.755,Do I make myself clear?
01:12:24.006,01:12:26.175,We will take care of the two bodies downstairs.
01:12:26.425,01:12:28.510,We'll add them to the cost of Mr. Fenster.
01:12:29.470,01:12:31.055,"Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen."
01:13:12.262,01:13:14.973,"Close quarters, ten, maybe 20 men."
01:13:15.974,01:13:18.268,There's no telling how many more are gonna be below deck.
01:13:18.602,01:13:19.645,Can we stealth these guys?
01:13:19.728,01:13:20.687,Nah.
01:13:21.438,01:13:23.399,"With all that coke, they're gonna be ready."
01:13:25.442,01:13:27.528,Which brings me to sunny point number two.
01:13:28.237,01:13:31.615,"Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we still get nothing."
01:13:31.865,01:13:33.242,What if we wait for the money?
01:13:34.159,01:13:35.744,"Ten more men, at least."
01:13:36.703,01:13:39.748,"Look, in my opinion, it can't be done."
01:13:40.165,01:13:42.126,Anybody who goes in there is not coming out alive.
01:13:45.462,01:13:46.922,Did you hear what he just said?
01:13:47.005,01:13:48.632,"If I'm going in, I want a cut."
01:13:51.677,01:13:53.220,There's nothing that can't be done.
01:13:56.682,01:13:59.059,I just can't believe we're gonna walk into certain death.
01:14:06.608,01:14:08.527,The news said it's raining in New York.
01:14:32.801,01:14:35.679,"I don't know. Russian, I think."
01:14:37.514,01:14:38.557,Hungarian.
01:15:43.413,01:15:45.499,"The package has arrived, gentlemen."
01:16:05.727,01:16:06.937,You kids ready?
01:16:07.688,01:16:09.856,I would be if I didn't have to stop and answer you.
01:16:10.524,01:16:11.525,I'm ready.
01:16:12.150,01:16:14.236,"McManus, you better be set up in ten seconds."
01:16:17.030,01:16:17.990,I'm ready.
01:16:19.658,01:16:21.243,I want you to stay here.
01:16:22.619,01:16:23.745,I'm supposed to cover...
01:16:23.829,01:16:26.665,"Listen, if we don't get out of this, I want you to take the money and go."
01:16:26.957,01:16:28.625,"-Keaton, I can't... -Find Edie."
01:16:28.709,01:16:30.460,Tell her what happened. Tell her everything.
01:16:30.627,01:16:32.546,She knows people. She knows what to do.
01:16:32.796,01:16:35.674,"If I don't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way."
01:16:35.757,01:16:37.426,"-What if I-- -Please, just do what I say."
01:16:38.677,01:16:39.720,Please.
01:16:43.181,01:16:44.391,Tell her that...
01:16:48.395,01:16:49.730,Tell her I tried.
01:18:18.068,01:18:18.985,Hi.
01:18:19.945,01:18:21.029,How you doing?
01:18:24.282,01:18:25.951,"Is there, is there a problem?"
01:18:52.018,01:18:52.978,Now.
01:20:08.136,01:20:09.262,Elvis has left the building.
01:21:36.766,01:21:37.809,Hello.
01:22:34.616,01:22:35.700,I froze up.
01:22:37.077,01:22:39.579,I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him.
01:22:40.413,01:22:42.916,"And then I thought about Keaton, it looked like he might pull it off."
01:22:51.091,01:22:52.968,A boy came across a body on the beach this morning.
01:22:53.051,01:22:55.220,Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot twice in the head.
01:22:55.428,01:22:56.930,Two guys from the Bureau just identified him.
01:22:57.097,01:22:58.139,What else?
01:22:58.223,01:23:01.643,"His name was Arturro Marquez, a petty smuggler from Argentina."
01:23:01.726,01:23:04.104,He was arrested last year in New York for trafficking.
01:23:04.312,01:23:06.064,He escapes to California.
01:23:06.314,01:23:07.816,They pick him up in Long Beach.
01:23:08.274,01:23:11.236,"They're setting up extradition, he escapes again."
01:23:11.653,01:23:12.779,"Now, get this."
01:23:13.113,01:23:16.157,Edie Finneran's brought in to advise on the proceedings.
01:23:16.616,01:23:17.701,Kobayashi.
01:23:18.201,01:23:20.161,New York faxed me a copy of his testimony.
01:23:20.328,01:23:21.287,He was a rat.
01:23:21.621,01:23:22.956,"Yeah, a big fucking rat."
01:23:23.039,01:23:25.750,Arturro was very opposed to returning to prison.
01:23:26.001,01:23:29.587,So much so that he named close to 50 people.
01:23:30.046,01:23:31.923,Guess who he named in the finale.
01:23:33.341,01:23:34.509,Keyser Soze.
01:23:48.773,01:23:50.108,I'll tell you what I know.
01:23:50.817,01:23:52.610,Stop me when this sounds familiar.
01:23:54.404,01:23:56.197,There was no dope on that boat.
01:24:38.406,01:24:39.741,"You, stay quiet."
01:24:39.991,01:24:41.034,He's here.
01:24:42.118,01:24:44.412,I know he's here. That's him.
01:24:44.496,01:24:45.830,"I'm telling you, that's him."
01:24:46.081,01:24:47.373,I know he's here!
01:24:49.125,01:24:51.377,You can't understand. That's him.
01:24:51.628,01:24:53.046,"-Shut up. -That's him, you hear me?"
01:24:53.880,01:24:56.382,"I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!"
01:26:55.376,01:26:56.628,-Where's Hockney? -I don't know.
01:26:56.920,01:26:58.171,There's no coke.
01:26:59.088,01:27:01.007,"-What? -You heard me, you dumb fuck."
01:27:01.090,01:27:02.217,There's no coke!
01:27:02.300,01:27:03.301,"What the fuck do you mean, there's no coke?"
01:27:03.384,01:27:04.427,I've been up and down this ship.
01:27:04.510,01:27:05.720,I've been in every fucking room!
01:27:05.803,01:27:07.722,-There's gotta be coke! -There is nothing!
01:27:08.264,01:27:09.140,Nothing!
01:27:10.183,01:27:11.392,Don't you fuck with me.
01:27:11.643,01:27:15.521,There is no fucking coke!
01:27:26.574,01:27:27.575,I'm outta here.
01:28:09.158,01:28:10.326,I told them nothing.
01:28:12.078,01:28:13.079,I swear.
01:28:14.080,01:28:16.040,I told them nothing. Please.
01:29:02.920,01:29:05.340,"McManus, what the fuck is going on?"
01:29:08.551,01:29:09.761,Strangest thing.
01:30:06.400,01:30:08.277,You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.
01:30:08.361,01:30:09.779,-Wait a minute. -I don't have a minute.
01:30:10.071,01:30:11.906,"Now, are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?"
01:30:11.989,01:30:13.741,You told the DA you didn't know who it was.
01:30:13.825,01:30:15.493,I know there was dope on that boat.
01:30:15.576,01:30:17.286,"-Stop stalling, Verbal. -I'm not stalling."
01:30:17.370,01:30:18.746,-You know what I'm getting at. -Get out of my face.
01:30:18.830,01:30:20.373,-You know what I'm getting at. -I got immunity.
01:30:20.456,01:30:21.499,I don't have to take that shit.
01:30:21.582,01:30:23.126,"You know what, you know what..."
01:30:23.209,01:30:25.044,"You know what I'm getting at, Verbal. Yes, you do!"
01:30:25.128,01:30:26.712,-I don't know what you're talking about. -The truth!
01:30:26.921,01:30:28.714,Try to tell me you saw someone kill Keaton.
01:30:28.798,01:30:30.383,I don't know what you're talking about. I did. I did.
01:30:30.466,01:30:31.717,-You're lying to me. -I am not...
01:30:31.801,01:30:34.178,"You've known, you've known this whole fucking time."
01:30:34.262,01:30:35.888,-I don't know what you're saying. -You know.
01:30:35.972,01:30:38.224,"I did see Keaton get shot, I swear to you."
01:30:38.307,01:30:40.059,Then why didn't you help him? You had a gun.
01:30:40.143,01:30:41.978,Why didn't you help him? He was your friend.
01:30:46.649,01:30:47.984,Because I was afraid.
01:30:49.193,01:30:50.278,Okay?
01:30:50.570,01:30:52.405,-Afraid. -Afraid of what?
01:30:54.532,01:30:56.242,-Afraid of... -I knew t was Keyser Soze.
01:30:56.617,01:30:58.744,"-But Keaton... -It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan."
01:30:58.828,01:31:00.413,"I mean, the Devil himself."
01:31:01.956,01:31:04.000,How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
01:31:08.921,01:31:10.047,What if you miss?
01:31:15.511,01:31:17.555,All right. Let's get back to the pier.
01:32:41.222,01:32:43.057,Arturro Marquez. Ever hear of him?
01:32:43.140,01:32:44.684,What? No.
01:32:47.603,01:32:54.652,He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals saying that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze.
01:32:54.986,01:32:56.612,It says right here in the report.
01:32:56.946,01:33:03.119,"He had intimate knowledge of his businesses, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder."
01:33:03.202,01:33:04.453,I never heard of him.
01:33:04.912,01:33:07.498,His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians.
01:33:07.748,01:33:11.377,Most likely the same Hungarians that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.
01:33:11.544,01:33:13.212,The money wasn't there for dope.
01:33:13.421,01:33:17.967,The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could incriminate Keyser Soze.
01:33:18.134,01:33:19.302,I said I never heard of him.
01:33:19.510,01:33:20.428,But Keaton did.
01:33:20.803,01:33:23.889,Edie Finneran was Marquez's extradition advisor.
01:33:24.015,01:33:25.308,She knew who he was and what he knew.
01:33:25.474,01:33:26.517,I don't...
01:33:26.600,01:33:29.520,There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit.
01:33:29.895,01:33:34.817,A suicide mission to whack out the one guy that could finger Keyser Soze.
01:33:34.900,01:33:39.655,"So, Soze put some thieves to it, men he knew he could march into certain death."
01:33:39.864,01:33:42.533,You're saying Soze sent us to kill someone?
01:33:44.785,01:33:46.454,"Verbal, he left you behind for a reason."
01:33:46.537,01:33:48.164,Just do what I tell you.
01:33:48.331,01:33:53.544,"If you all knew that Soze could find you anywhere, why did he give you the money to run?"
01:33:53.711,01:33:55.338,He could have used you on the boat.
01:33:55.755,01:33:56.922,He wanted me to live.
01:34:01.427,01:34:04.638,finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat cripple?
01:34:04.805,01:34:05.765,"No, sir. Why?"
01:34:07.016,01:34:07.850,Edie.
01:34:10.853,01:34:15.274,"Even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her."
01:34:15.900,01:34:16.942,"So, why?"
01:34:21.655,01:34:24.200,"No, Verbal, he wasn't your friend."
01:34:24.325,01:34:25.910,Keaton didn't have friends.
01:34:26.077,01:34:27.244,What are you doing here?
01:34:27.328,01:34:29.789,He saved you because he wanted it that way.
01:34:29.872,01:34:31.123,It was his will.
01:34:31.791,01:34:33.709,Keaton was Keyser Soze.
01:34:33.793,01:34:34.627,No.
01:34:34.710,01:34:38.005,The kind of man who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus.
01:34:38.089,01:34:43.344,The kind of man who could engineer a police lineup through all his years of contacts in NYPD.
01:34:43.469,01:34:46.097,The kind of man who could've killed Edie Finneran.
01:34:51.143,01:34:55.314,"She was found yesterday at a hotel in Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head."
01:35:00.736,01:35:02.363,"What do you think about Keaton now, Verbal?"
01:35:04.782,01:35:05.741,Edie?
01:35:05.825,01:35:07.535,He used all of you to get him on that boat.
01:35:08.035,01:35:09.453,He couldn't get on alone.
01:35:09.912,01:35:15.709,"He had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man, the one man that could identify him."
01:35:16.669,01:35:18.129,This is all bullshit.
01:35:18.671,01:35:19.922,You said you saw him die.
01:35:23.134,01:35:24.301,Or did you?
01:35:24.385,01:35:26.762,You had to hide when you first heard the police cars.
01:35:26.846,01:35:30.850,"You said you heard the shot before the fire, but you didn't see him die."
01:35:31.892,01:35:34.770,-I knew him. He would never... -He programmed you.
01:35:34.854,01:35:37.523,He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to.
01:35:37.606,01:35:39.650,"He knew we were close, you said it yourself."
01:35:39.733,01:35:41.569,Where was the political pressure coming from?
01:35:41.652,01:35:43.904,Why were you being protected? It was Keaton.
01:35:44.071,01:35:45.781,Immunity was your reward.
01:35:46.073,01:35:47.199,But why me?
01:35:48.159,01:35:50.286,Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?
01:35:50.369,01:35:53.038,"Why me? I'm stupid, I'm a cripple. Why me?"
01:35:53.122,01:35:56.041,"Because you're a cripple, Verbal. Because you're stupid."
01:35:56.917,01:35:58.377,Because you're weaker than them.
01:36:02.965,01:36:08.137,"If he's dead, if what you say is true, then it won't matter."
01:36:10.431,01:36:13.017,"It was his idea to hit the taxi service in New York, wasn't it?"
01:36:13.434,01:36:14.685,"Come on, tell me the truth."
01:36:17.813,01:36:19.857,We followed him from the beginning.
01:36:19.940,01:36:20.774,Yeah.
01:36:22.067,01:36:25.237,I didn't know. I saw him die.
01:36:26.363,01:36:29.241,"I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ."
01:36:30.784,01:36:32.077,You're not safe on your own.
01:36:36.373,01:36:38.959,-You think he's... -Keyser Soze?
01:36:40.085,01:36:41.295,"I don't know, Verbal."
01:36:43.547,01:36:46.717,"Keyser Soze's a shield, or like you said, a spook story."
01:36:48.344,01:36:52.515,"But I know Keaton, and someone is out there pulling strings for you."
01:36:52.973,01:36:54.266,Stay here and let us protect you.
01:36:54.391,01:36:56.477,"No way, I'm not bait. I post today."
01:36:56.560,01:36:58.187,You posted 20 minutes ago.
01:36:58.687,01:37:02.483,"Captain Leo wants you out of here ASAP, unless you turn State's."
01:37:02.566,01:37:04.193,"I'll take my chances, thank you."
01:37:04.443,01:37:07.738,"If someone wants to get you, they're gonna get you out there."
01:37:07.863,01:37:09.156,Turn State's evidence.
01:37:09.698,01:37:11.200,You might never see trial.
01:37:11.367,01:37:12.493,Maybe so.
01:37:14.328,01:37:16.580,"But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan."
01:37:32.930,01:37:34.390,Fucking cops.
01:37:59.164,01:38:01.584,"Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?"
01:38:05.546,01:38:07.756,"You'll have to sign for these, Mr. Kint."
01:38:10.175,01:38:11.677,"One watch, gold."
01:38:12.428,01:38:14.346,"One cigarette lighter, gold."
01:38:15.472,01:38:17.433,-One pack of cigarettes. -Thank you.
01:38:18.058,01:38:19.727,"We've still got nothing, Dave."
01:38:20.561,01:38:22.396,I know what I wanted to know about Keaton.
01:38:22.605,01:38:23.814,Which is nothing.
01:38:24.815,01:38:25.899,No matter.
01:38:26.400,01:38:28.360,He'll have to know how close we came.
01:38:32.072,01:38:34.408,"if Keaton is alive, he's not coming up again."
01:38:49.798,01:38:51.216,"Man, you're a slob."
01:38:51.884,01:38:54.094,"Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave."
01:38:55.054,01:38:56.430,It all makes sense when you look at it right.
01:38:56.513,01:38:58.641,"You gotta like stand back from it, you know?"
01:39:00.809,01:39:03.437,You wanna see a real horror show? See my garage.
01:39:45.145,01:39:46.105,"in Skokie, Illinois..."
01:39:46.188,01:39:47.564,"Where's your head, Agent Kujan?"
01:39:54.321,01:39:55.447,Tell me every last detail.
01:40:07.710,01:40:08.627,There was a lawyer.
01:40:11.839,01:40:15.217,"Back when I was picking beans in Guatemala, we used to make fresh coffee."
01:40:28.397,01:40:29.606,Tell me every last detail.
01:40:36.029,01:40:37.865,Tell me every last detail.
01:40:59.303,01:41:01.180,will know the name of Verbal Kint.
01:41:01.889,01:41:03.557,"-The cripple, did you see him? -What?"
01:41:03.724,01:41:05.142,The cripple! Which way did he go?
01:41:05.225,01:41:06.935,Oh. He went out that way.
01:41:08.103,01:41:09.480,I know you're not telling.
01:41:09.563,01:41:13.150,I'm smarter than you and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know whether you like it or not.
01:41:14.526,01:41:15.986,that complicated. It's always simple.
01:41:18.363,01:41:19.907,no arch-criminal behind it all.
01:41:19.990,01:41:22.826,"Somebody with power, somebody who's capable of tracking us..."
01:41:24.036,01:41:25.329,It's Keyser Soze.
01:41:26.955,01:41:30.209,comes this close to getting caught and sticks his head out?
01:41:41.386,01:41:42.930,I'm sure Keaton is dead.
01:41:48.268,01:41:49.895,How to spot a murderer.
01:41:57.361,01:41:59.363,my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
01:42:23.345,01:42:25.472,was convincing the world he didn't exist.
01:42:28.183,01:42:31.645,"And like that, he's gone."
00:02:17.095,00:17:02.438,"SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - LAST NIGHT NEW YORK CITY - 6 WEEKS AGO SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA - PRESENT DAY."
