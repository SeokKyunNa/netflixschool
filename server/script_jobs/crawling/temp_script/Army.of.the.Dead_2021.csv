00:01:00.708,00:01:02.583,"I think it went. Go, baby."
00:01:02.666,00:01:04.208,Let's go. Let's go.
00:01:21.625,00:01:26.500,"Love, love, love… What are you doing? Get in here. I feel it!"
00:01:31.458,00:01:33.375,Why we need all this firepower to protect it?
00:01:35.541,00:01:41.291,to the original copy of the Constitution but the one written in the Founding Fathers' blood.
00:01:41.958,00:01:47.500,"Right. Or like, uh… …Bigfoot."
00:01:47.583,00:01:55.041,"I was thinking more like headpiece to the Staff of Ra or, uh, Amelia Earhart but alive."
00:01:55.125,00:01:57.625,"-So, the less you know, the better. -True."
00:01:57.708,00:02:01.541,I got you a little present for making an honest woman out of me.
00:02:04.541,00:02:05.875,Oh.
00:02:05.958,00:02:07.208,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:07.291,00:02:08.208,Okay.
00:02:08.791,00:02:11.458,Get in there. All right.
00:02:11.541,00:02:13.958,"You are in trouble now, mister."
00:02:28.833,00:02:32.583,How about the lunar lander that was supposedly left on the moon?
00:02:35.583,00:02:38.833,"seeing as we're just coming from, uh… Well, you know."
00:02:38.916,00:02:41.333,-So you're saying there's a chance. -Chance of what?
00:02:41.416,00:02:43.875,"Chance we're hauling a… Well, you know."
00:02:45.041,00:02:45.916,The Holy Grail.
00:02:46.000,00:02:47.875,"Yeah, could be the Grail."
00:02:47.958,00:02:52.416,Not the Grail Grail but the Holy Grail of things we shouldn't be hauling.
00:02:53.916,00:02:55.791,You're gonna just make me say it out loud?
00:02:55.875,00:02:59.083,"I honestly don't… I mean, you're being cryptic."
00:03:07.958,00:03:09.500,Area 51.
00:03:09.583,00:03:12.541,Secret hangar. Autopsy.
00:03:15.083,00:03:17.000,"All right, I'll say it. It's an alien."
00:03:17.083,00:03:18.416,"-Oh, my God! -Look out!"
00:03:40.958,00:03:42.250,"Come on, guys. Hustle up."
00:03:50.041,00:03:53.000,Never mind. They're dead in there. Let's get to this one. Come on.
00:03:55.458,00:03:57.625,"Mothership, this is the Four Horsemen. Do you copy?"
00:03:59.750,00:04:02.916,"We're in an emergency situation, Mothership. Requesting support."
00:04:05.333,00:04:07.208,What is the nature of your emergency?
00:04:07.833,00:04:10.125,"We've been in a serious accident, Mothership."
00:04:10.208,00:04:12.416,We got numerous fatalities for sure.
00:04:12.500,00:04:13.875,We need a medevac ASAP.
00:04:19.250,00:04:21.708,Keep your comms open while I contact the medevac.
00:04:32.375,00:04:33.583,The payload.
00:04:34.291,00:04:44.791,"Uh… Yeah, payload is compromised."
00:04:45.500,00:04:47.875,Looks like it's busted open in the middle of the highway.
00:04:51.083,00:04:52.500,"All right, listen carefully."
00:04:52.583,00:04:56.291,Gather whoever can walk or move and get away from the payload immediately.
00:04:56.375,00:04:58.458,"Wait, what are you telling me to do?"
00:05:01.791,00:05:03.666,"If they can't move, leave them. You understand?"
00:05:03.750,00:05:06.500,Get away from that location now! Do you copy?
00:05:06.583,00:05:07.916,"Yeah, yeah, I copy."
00:05:24.000,00:05:24.958,Leave it.
00:05:25.583,00:05:26.458,Do what?
00:05:30.666,00:05:48.125,"They said stay… Hey, we gotta go."
00:05:48.208,00:05:50.666,You heard what they said. We need to move now!
00:05:53.583,00:05:55.375,We need to go back. They need our help!
00:05:55.458,00:05:58.541,No. There is no they. You understand? Everyone's fucked. Come on.
00:06:06.416,00:06:08.125,"Wait, wait, wait! Wait!"
00:06:09.000,00:06:11.291,"No, no, no. We can't stop. We got to keep moving."
00:06:11.375,00:06:13.541,We're far enough away now. It's okay.
00:06:13.625,00:06:15.500,It is so not okay.
00:06:17.041,00:06:18.125,"All right, all right."
00:06:30.291,00:06:31.750,It's hunting us.
00:08:19.000,00:10:58.833,"A one, two, three, four… And now, ladies and gentlemen, joining me at the microphone, Ms. Allison Crowe."
00:14:14.958,00:14:36.291,"in response to yesterday's historic Congressional vote that narrowly ratified the controversial proposal to wipe out the last remains of the so-called Zombie Wars, which drew to a dramatic end with the US military suffering massive casualties and being forced to retreat as Vegas was walled off with the zombies left inside to haunt the abandoned city."
00:14:36.375,00:14:56.166,"This will mark the culmination of the president's efforts to fulfill his campaign promise to exterminate Las Vegas' undead population by taking the extreme action of dropping a low-yield tactical nuclear bomb on the city of Las Vegas in four days' time, coinciding with sunset on the Fourth of July holiday."
00:14:56.250,00:15:08.166,"The executive order has prompted the full evacuation of the McCarran quarantine camp, which has long been the target of civil rights groups who have argued that no evidence of infection has been detected in the camp."
00:15:08.250,00:15:09.291,Excuse me.
00:15:09.833,00:15:11.916,"May I talk to that gentleman, please?"
00:15:14.500,00:15:15.666,Mr. Ward.
00:15:17.083,00:15:19.958,"Hey. You're Bly Tanaka, right?"
00:15:20.750,00:15:21.750,You want to see me?
00:15:22.375,00:15:33.250,"It's not every man who saves the secretary of defense from a horde of flesh-eating monsters, earns the Medal of Freedom, only to end up… Working at a burger joint."
00:15:33.333,00:15:35.791,"Mr. Tanaka, I am well aware of my situation."
00:15:37.791,00:15:42.083,There's $200 million in the basement vault beneath the Strip.
00:15:42.916,00:15:49.541,"Two hundred million the insurance company already reimbursed me for, un-taxable, untraceable."
00:15:49.625,00:15:50.916,Un-spendable.
00:15:53.000,00:16:03.750,"With 96 hours left, the government has already moved more than half of its military presence out of the quarantine zone, which makes it vulnerable."
00:16:03.833,00:16:06.791,I want you to put together a team and get it out.
00:16:07.375,00:16:13.041,"In exchange, 50 million is yours to divvy up amongst whomever you take in with you."
00:16:14.083,00:16:15.125,Intrigued?
00:16:16.458,00:16:17.583,Don't give me an answer.
00:16:17.666,00:16:19.166,Think on it for the night.
00:16:23.333,00:16:24.458,In good faith.
00:16:51.791,00:16:57.125,that this is essentially a government-funded health care solution that will put an end to all of this.
00:16:59.666,00:17:01.833,"If they were, they would be zombies already."
00:17:01.916,00:17:05.541,"They're political prisoners, just people the government doesn't want on the streets."
00:17:05.625,00:17:18.458,"You know as well as I do, if you have questionable immigration status, advocate for gay rights or abortion, the next thing you know, they have a temperature gun at your head or dragging you out of your house or your car under the guise of public safety."
00:17:21.625,00:17:23.666,This is no different.
00:17:34.750,00:17:37.666,This facility is in an active evacuation.
00:17:38.166,00:17:40.125,Board the shuttle bus for Barstow.
00:17:40.708,00:17:46.291,Have your current temporary health clearance card to present to officials as you board the shuttle.
00:17:46.375,00:17:48.666,"Reminder, shuttles will be leaving every 15 minutes."
00:17:48.750,00:17:50.208,"-Hey, guys. -Kate!"
00:17:52.666,00:17:54.750,-You guys excited for the big move? -Yeah!
00:17:54.833,00:17:57.375,"Kate, let the kids finish packing."
00:17:57.458,00:17:58.583,Go on. Come on.
00:18:00.750,00:18:03.250,"Kate, I need you to promise me something."
00:18:03.333,00:18:09.083,"In case anything happens to me in the next few days, just make sure the kids make it out to Barstow. Okay?"
00:18:09.708,00:18:11.958,What do you mean? What could happen?
00:18:15.125,00:18:16.375,"You know her, don't you?"
00:18:18.833,00:18:20.041,The coyote.
00:18:20.666,00:18:23.583,"Geeta, that is not an option."
00:18:26.333,00:18:28.250,"crack a slot machine, slip back out."
00:18:28.333,00:18:30.250,"Before anyone even knows, you're gone."
00:18:31.416,00:18:35.500,"That money is our ticket out of here, or we'll be trapped in Barstow forever."
00:18:36.083,00:18:38.916,"Listen, these guards, they don't give a shit."
00:18:39.000,00:18:43.041,"But for five grand, I can buy my way out, me and my kids."
00:18:44.250,00:18:51.750,"I have to get the kids out by Friday, and I will do whatever it takes to protect my family."
00:18:51.833,00:18:56.041,"Geeta, people that go in there, they don't always come back."
00:18:56.125,00:18:57.208,Just forget it.
00:18:57.291,00:19:00.208,"-Hey, wait, wait, wait, Geeta, come on. -Just let it go, okay?"
00:19:03.208,00:19:04.791,"Everything okay here, ladies?"
00:19:06.541,00:19:08.750,"What, you don't have anything better to do?"
00:19:08.833,00:19:12.791,"Kate… -The fuck you say to me, volunteer? -She didn't say anything."
00:19:15.083,00:19:18.875,Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up!
00:19:18.958,00:19:19.791,Okay.
00:19:20.333,00:19:22.875,What? Were you saying something to me?
00:19:25.916,00:19:27.666,"No, I didn't say anything."
00:19:32.208,00:19:38.416,"You know, the first sign of infection is belligerence and actions outside of social norms."
00:19:45.458,00:19:48.000,Look at me and hold still.
00:19:58.208,00:19:59.041,Clear.
00:20:01.125,00:20:03.500,employee shuttles leave in five minutes.
00:20:04.166,00:20:05.333,Your turn.
00:20:06.750,00:20:10.958,"If you want, I could use my rectal thermometer."
00:20:26.166,00:20:28.125,You're down a couple of decimal points.
00:20:28.708,00:20:30.333,You sure you're feeling all right?
00:20:30.916,00:20:33.625,-You sure you're not infected? -I… I'm fine.
00:20:33.708,00:20:36.708,I'm fine. I'm… I feel fine.
00:20:39.875,00:20:45.125,"Well, you're both within the margin of error, but watch it."
00:20:48.083,00:20:50.291,"You better be on that bus, volunteer."
00:20:53.250,00:20:54.125,Asshole.
00:20:55.166,00:20:56.625,What were you thinking?
00:20:56.708,00:20:59.833,Do you know how easy it would be for him to make you disappear?
00:20:59.916,00:21:04.833,"All he has to say is that you dropped a degree, and nobody would question it, nobody."
00:21:05.458,00:21:06.708,"-I know, I'm… -You know?"
00:21:06.791,00:21:11.541,"I just… He… Look, it doesn't matter."
00:21:13.750,00:21:17.791,I need you to promise me that you're not gonna do anything stupid.
00:21:18.500,00:21:21.833,"Geeta, it's… it's not worth the risk."
00:21:23.041,00:21:24.375,"No, you're right."
00:21:25.166,00:21:26.125,I won't.
00:21:27.083,00:21:28.500,I promise. Okay?
00:21:29.791,00:21:30.750,Thanks.
00:23:59.750,00:24:00.583,Yes?
00:24:05.125,00:24:06.583,I don't like you very much.
00:24:08.291,00:24:17.541,"So I hate giving you the satisfaction of taking the job, but… You'll need a helicopter pilot and a safecracker."
00:24:18.208,00:24:20.333,I'm gonna text you an address.
00:24:20.416,00:24:22.375,Be there at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow.
00:24:28.708,00:24:29.750,He's in.
00:24:33.458,00:24:38.291,"I have to take the kids to school, and if I can't get to my job-- Don't worry, I'll fix it."
00:24:40.250,00:24:43.083,"Don't worry about it. Careful, I'm all greasy."
00:24:46.125,00:24:48.500,"-Gracias, Maria. -Say hi to the kids."
00:24:53.333,00:24:54.250,Fuck.
00:25:00.208,00:25:01.083,Hey.
00:25:10.583,00:25:17.166,"It's not a matter of think. It's a matter of is, and it is a bad goddamn idea."
00:25:22.375,00:25:23.708,I didn't say that either.
00:25:24.958,00:25:26.166,But you're intrigued.
00:25:26.875,00:25:30.500,That much I'm guessing your ass knew before you even walked in.
00:25:33.666,00:25:38.208,"Everything we did, all those people we saved, look what it got us."
00:25:38.791,00:25:44.083,"But what if… what if just once, we did something just for us?"
00:25:49.000,00:25:50.083,We could die.
00:25:54.958,00:25:56.375,"Yeah, we'll probably die."
00:25:58.625,00:26:00.000,Some of us at least.
00:26:01.958,00:26:03.416,Fifty million dollars.
00:26:04.083,00:26:05.125,Fifty million.
00:26:05.208,00:26:08.166,What's the split? Even however many ways?
00:26:08.250,00:26:12.166,"Figured you, me, and Vanderohe will take 15 million each, assuming he'll do it."
00:26:14.791,00:26:18.916,Everybody else who isn't family… Nobody needs to know our cut.
00:26:36.208,00:26:37.708,Talk to me. How'd it go?
00:26:41.583,00:26:46.791,We can't make small talk for more than 35 minutes without it turning into a fight.
00:26:48.166,00:26:50.041,"Still, she seems happy."
00:26:50.125,00:26:52.333,"That's what matters, I suppose."
00:26:52.416,00:26:56.291,"I'm sure that she appreciates you, even if you don't realize it."
00:26:56.375,00:26:57.541,-Mmm. -I mean it.
00:27:08.000,00:27:19.250,"You know, when we were in it, like, when we were really in it, I never thought about the faces of all the countless monsters but now just realized, you know, were people."
00:27:19.333,00:27:22.250,"But now their faces, that's all I see."
00:27:23.083,00:27:25.166,I don't know if being back in would be better or worse.
00:27:25.250,00:27:33.166,"God, I can't figure that out, but I guess there is a chance that it could be… cathartic."
00:27:36.375,00:27:37.291,There it is.
00:27:42.791,00:27:52.583,"They should have nuked Vegas in the early '90s, but… Holy shit."
00:27:57.083,00:27:57.916,How's the job?
00:27:58.000,00:28:00.791,Sucks ass. What're you guys doing here?
00:28:01.750,00:28:04.458,-Well-- -We are putting together a crew for a job.
00:28:04.541,00:28:05.791,Yeah? What does it pay?
00:28:05.875,00:28:10.541,"Well, if it pans out, you make two million dollars for one day's work."
00:28:10.625,00:28:17.041,-Two million dollars? -But-- Two million dollars if it pans out?
00:28:18.875,00:28:21.041,Hundred percent. I'm in. Yeah.
00:28:21.125,00:28:27.416,You don't want to know the risks or-- Why would I want to know the risks? Two million dollars? That's a lot of cash.
00:28:27.500,00:28:35.625,"Listen, I hate my life so deeply, if I had two million dollars, my life would change drastically."
00:28:36.166,00:28:39.083,Yeah. Thank you. Yes.
00:28:39.166,00:28:40.625,You sure you don't want to know?
00:28:40.708,00:28:43.958,Uh… I bet it has something to do with a helicopter.
00:28:44.958,00:28:46.916,-I'm the helicopter guy. Yeah. -Yeah.
00:28:52.583,00:28:54.041,"She hasn't changed, has she?"
00:28:54.125,00:28:56.750,Nope. Still weird as ever.
00:28:56.833,00:28:58.666,Come on. This next one's on me.
00:29:05.208,00:29:06.458,Come on. Shit.
00:29:06.541,00:29:09.791,"That's it, baby. That's what I'm fuckin' talking about!"
00:29:10.625,00:29:11.833,Mikey Guzman.
00:29:11.916,00:29:15.416,-Mikey Guzman. Name rings a bell. -Mm-hmm.

00:29:18.083,00:29:21.083,"This is your boy, Mikey Guzman, taping live from East Las Vegas."
00:29:21.166,00:29:25.208,"We got a group of… I counted at least five, but let me double-check. Hold on."
00:29:25.291,00:29:27.208,Seven. We got seven shamblers.
00:29:28.416,00:29:30.958,"Boom, motherfucker! Double headshot."
00:29:36.708,00:29:39.250,There are Reddit forums devoted to this guy.
00:29:40.583,00:29:41.583,"Swagger, baby!"
00:29:42.166,00:29:44.833,"-Swagger, man. Hell, yeah. -That's how it's done."

00:29:53.833,00:29:54.958,"Qué onda, güero?"
00:29:57.708,00:29:58.875,"Yo, what's up?"
00:29:58.958,00:30:01.166,What would you say about making 500 grand?
00:30:03.541,00:30:05.583,"I'd say, Who the hell do I gotta kill?"
00:30:07.333,00:30:08.375,I love him.
00:30:11.875,00:30:13.208,What are we doing here?
00:30:13.291,00:30:16.250,You told me you needed a safecracker. Might be your missing piece.
00:30:22.375,00:30:23.375,"Oh, my God."
00:30:27.791,00:30:29.166,-Can I crack it? -Yeah.
00:30:32.125,00:30:33.000,Can I crack it?
00:30:33.833,00:30:39.416,This is like showing me a picture of Botticelli's Madonna of the Magnificat and asking me if I want to fuck her.
00:30:40.958,00:30:55.958,"Okay, the man who designed this wonderful work of art, Hans Wagner, he named it Der Götterdämmerung for the final chapter in his namesake, Richard Wagner's epic opera, Der Ring des Nibelungen."
00:30:59.083,00:30:59.916,I don't know.
00:31:00.000,00:31:01.458,-I honestly don't. -Okay.
00:31:01.541,00:31:04.250,"Watch your fingers, Mr. Big Hand."
00:31:04.333,00:31:09.833,"But of the world's living locksmiths, do I represent your greatest chance of opening it?"
00:31:09.916,00:31:12.916,"I can, with humility, say yes."
00:31:13.875,00:31:14.875,You're in?
00:31:14.958,00:31:19.625,"It's a doorway to another realm, my friends, and providence has brought you to me."
00:31:19.708,00:31:21.208,We go through it together.
00:31:21.291,00:31:23.916,"-By the way, what's your name? -Scott Ward."
00:31:25.375,00:31:27.541,"Dieter, Scott Ward."
00:32:16.500,00:32:17.625,Are you ready to play?
00:32:52.541,00:32:53.625,Yeah.
00:33:03.916,00:33:07.416,"Scott, this is Damon. That's Chambers."
00:33:07.500,00:33:10.041,-They're with me. They'll be on my dime. -Okay.
00:33:15.375,00:33:19.041,"Look at him. No offense, but he doesn't look like zombie killer material."
00:33:20.125,00:33:24.416,"Hi, my name is Dieter, and I'm going to open what cannot be opened."
00:33:28.791,00:33:30.250,"We lose him, we got nothing."
00:33:32.000,00:33:33.416,"Let's go, guys. Bring it in."
00:33:34.000,00:33:35.791,"Mr. Tanaka, team's all here."
00:33:38.666,00:33:40.000,Meet your target.
00:33:42.583,00:33:43.916,The Vegas Bly.
00:33:44.666,00:33:46.333,You can't fly into Vegas.
00:33:47.000,00:33:48.708,It's restricted airspace.
00:33:49.208,00:33:50.458,But you can fly out.
00:33:51.333,00:33:56.916,"There is an abandoned rescue helicopter on top of the north tower, Sodom."
00:33:57.500,00:34:02.625,"If you coordinate and communicate, this should be a simple in-and-out."
00:34:09.208,00:34:15.333,Whatever zombies are still walking should be no problem for a gang of tough hombres such as yourselves.
00:34:37.833,00:34:39.833,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!"
00:34:42.666,00:34:43.791,My apologies.
00:34:43.875,00:34:46.291,How precisely do we do the zombie killing?
00:34:46.958,00:34:48.250,"Oh, Jesus."
00:34:55.250,00:34:57.583,"Well, we all know the basics."
00:34:57.666,00:35:03.041,"Zombies, shamblers, the undead, whatever you wanna call them, when it comes to killing them, it's all about the brain."
00:35:03.125,00:35:03.958,Brain.
00:35:04.041,00:35:07.833,"One comes at you, shoot it in the brain. It's that simple. Any questions?"
00:35:09.000,00:35:13.541,Yes. What if I took a big rock and smashed it into the head?
00:35:13.625,00:35:14.833,Would… would that work?
00:35:16.166,00:35:21.000,"Yeah. Yeah, that, uh… that also would still be targeting the brain, so that would work."
00:35:21.083,00:35:22.125,Copy that.
00:35:22.208,00:35:24.125,"Sorry, Mr. Tanaka, please continue."
00:35:33.250,00:35:35.958,You'll reach the casino in less than two hours.
00:35:36.541,00:35:38.625,You go in and find the generator.
00:35:41.416,00:35:48.500,"The safe, beneath the south tower, Gomorrah… is at the end of a hallway."
00:35:48.583,00:35:51.583,"There, you'll find several nonlethal deterrents."
00:35:51.666,00:35:53.875,You'll have to find a way to trigger them.
00:35:54.541,00:35:59.208,"Meanwhile, our fearless pilot-slash-mechanic fuels the helicopter."
00:36:04.083,00:36:08.166,"Back at the main door, our safecracker gets to work."
00:36:09.791,00:36:17.541,"Like a surgeon or a painter, his masterpiece rendered in barely audible clicks."
00:36:18.750,00:36:23.083,"Finally, she succumbs to the sheer dominance of his gentle touch."
00:36:26.041,00:36:33.541,"Then, all you have to do is load the money on the helicopter and fly off into the sunset."
00:36:39.750,00:36:42.458,…a full day before the nuke ever leaves the launchpad.
00:36:42.541,00:36:45.041,Easy peasy Japanese-y.
00:36:47.541,00:36:51.083,We're not allowed to say that anymore. It's lemon squeezy now.
00:36:52.041,00:36:55.541,"Yeah, but I'm-- I think it's fine if he's Japanese-y."
00:36:58.041,00:37:01.375,Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
00:37:02.750,00:37:03.708,Take a look.
00:37:09.875,00:37:12.208,Oh. Okay. Good job. Good job.
00:37:16.791,00:37:21.500,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. This is the real plan? It's zombies?"
00:37:21.583,00:37:24.958,"Yeah, bro, what's going on? I thought you were cool with it."
00:37:25.625,00:37:28.916,"You were always talking about how, if you saw a zombie, you'd fuck his shit up."
00:37:29.000,00:37:30.791,"That was bullshit, man."
00:37:30.875,00:37:31.708,What?
00:37:33.500,00:37:35.875,This is crazy. You all are gonna die.
00:37:39.333,00:37:42.125,"Hey, Damon. Wait, man."
00:37:44.541,00:37:45.750,See you at 6:00 a.m. sharp.
00:37:47.916,00:37:49.500,"Now, hold up, hold up."
00:37:50.208,00:37:52.750,My name's Martin. I'm Mr. Tanaka's head of security.
00:37:54.041,00:37:56.125,"Anything you need, you talk to me."
00:37:57.083,00:37:59.250,I can access any hardware you might want.
00:37:59.333,00:38:03.625,I'll also be accompanying you on this job because of my extensive knowledge of the casino.
00:38:04.250,00:38:05.083,Any questions?
00:38:06.333,00:38:08.208,Good. See you at 0600.
00:38:13.583,00:38:21.166,"But if it's a choice between dying on the Strip and spending another day flipping patties at the Lucky Boy, I'll gamble on a few million."
00:38:21.250,00:38:24.708,Have you given any thought to how you'll get in?
00:38:26.083,00:38:26.916,Yeah.
00:38:30.333,00:38:34.333,Barstow Quarantine Center is a zero-tolerance facility.
00:38:35.000,00:38:40.583,"Without a green health clearance sticker on your key card, you will not be permitted in common areas."
00:38:45.750,00:38:48.416,-What are you doing here? -I need to talk to you.
00:38:48.500,00:38:49.625,-No. No! -Wait. Whoa!
00:38:49.708,00:38:52.000,Just hear me out. Hear me out.
00:38:55.875,00:38:59.875,"I have an opportunity, and I need your help."
00:39:01.916,00:39:04.583,Look. I know this is gonna sound crazy.
00:39:04.666,00:39:06.375,But do one thing for me.
00:39:06.458,00:39:07.291,For you?
00:39:07.375,00:39:10.666,"Do this one thing, and I can give you $15 million."
00:39:10.750,00:39:14.583,-Fifteen million? -Fifteen… You don't have $15 million.
00:39:14.666,00:39:18.083,"If you do this one thing for me, I will."
00:39:20.541,00:39:25.833,I know this is not gonna make up for what I did… Yeah.
00:39:25.916,00:39:28.291,"With $15 million, you can help these people."
00:39:28.375,00:39:30.541,"You can go back to school, do whatever you want."
00:39:30.625,00:39:34.125,"Whatever you do with this money, I know will be the right thing."
00:39:47.166,00:39:48.250,What one thing?
00:40:21.500,00:40:22.625,"You're the coyote, right?"
00:40:25.291,00:40:27.583,Take us in. Please.
00:40:29.166,00:40:30.166,Please.
00:40:35.583,00:40:37.375,Not bad for your first time.
00:40:44.166,00:40:45.625,"Hey, don't point a gun at me."
00:40:46.500,00:40:47.708,Sorry. Sorry.
00:40:49.958,00:40:51.708,Whoo!
00:40:55.875,00:40:59.125,"-Oh, good. You want some water? -Yeah."
00:41:14.000,00:41:16.041,You're kidding. What is this?
00:41:16.125,00:41:16.958,What?
00:41:17.041,00:41:23.708,"I swear to God, if this whole mission is some insane way for you to reconnect with your daughter-- It's not, all right? Trust me."
00:41:23.791,00:41:26.458,She's a volunteer at the camp. She's got connections.
00:41:27.125,00:41:29.500,She's just giving us a ride into the quarantine zone.
00:41:29.583,00:41:31.708,You really think I'd take her inside the city?
00:41:53.625,00:41:56.833,"Hey, how you doing? I don't think we've officially met. My name's Martin."
00:41:56.916,00:42:00.041,"Don't talk to me. I don't trust these people, especially you."
00:42:00.666,00:42:02.875,-Oh. -You stay the hell away from me.
00:42:02.958,00:42:03.875,"Yes, ma'am."
00:42:08.166,00:42:09.083,Ooh.
00:42:37.083,00:42:54.916,"this facility will be closed by the end of the day. No personnel… Criminals, meet your coyote."
00:42:55.666,00:42:56.958,Does coyote girl have a name?
00:42:57.041,00:42:59.375,"Lilly, but coyote sounds cool."
00:42:59.458,00:43:01.166,You can just call me that if you want.
00:43:01.708,00:43:03.750,"All right, I'll leave you guys to it."
00:43:03.833,00:43:05.875,I'll meet you outside Barstow in 24 hours.
00:43:05.958,00:43:07.500,-Okay? -Okay.
00:43:08.750,00:43:12.000,Try not to get nuked or murdered by the undead.
00:43:30.541,00:43:31.666,Mom's gone.
00:43:42.833,00:43:43.750,Question.
00:43:44.416,00:43:45.291,"Yes, Dieter."
00:43:45.375,00:43:47.916,You don't think I need something bigger?
00:43:49.000,00:43:51.416,"If I give you something bigger than that, you're already dead."
00:43:52.041,00:43:52.875,Dead?
00:43:53.375,00:43:55.083,"Auf Wiedersehen, dead."
00:43:58.166,00:43:59.958,"Um, this belongs to where?"
00:44:03.666,00:44:05.291,Give me a fucking break. Really?
00:44:05.375,00:44:07.958,"Dieter, try not to piss Van off."
00:44:09.000,00:44:09.833,"Thank you, sir."
00:44:13.875,00:44:14.708,Hey.
00:44:14.791,00:44:16.875,-What did you do? -What do you mean?
00:44:19.666,00:44:20.666,Get off me!
00:44:21.333,00:44:22.958,-Stop! -What the hell's going on?
00:44:23.041,00:44:24.208,The hell are you doing?
00:44:26.916,00:44:28.375,You took in Geeta.
00:44:31.333,00:44:34.666,I take a lot of people in. They need that money to get out of here.
00:44:34.750,00:44:36.208,-You know that. -She didn't come back.
00:44:36.291,00:44:38.083,"Well, not everyone does."
00:44:47.166,00:44:50.041,"Listen, if I knew she had kids, I wouldn't have taken her."
00:44:51.750,00:44:53.083,Did you see her die?
00:44:54.250,00:44:55.208,No.
00:44:56.458,00:44:58.541,They went ahead. I… I hung back.
00:45:00.416,00:45:03.041,They never came out. I'm sorry.
00:45:04.916,00:45:08.875,"I waited, Kate, as long as I could, but at the end of the day-- I'm coming with you."
00:45:11.291,00:45:12.833,"-No, you're not. -Yes, I am."
00:45:12.916,00:45:14.958,We're not having this conversation. You're not coming.
00:45:15.041,00:45:18.708,There are two kids whose mother is lost in there.
00:45:18.791,00:45:21.041,Two kids that I help look out for.
00:45:21.125,00:45:22.166,I have to find her.
00:45:22.250,00:45:24.541,"Well, tell us what she looks like. We'll look out for her."
00:45:24.625,00:45:26.625,-You think I trust you to do that? -Kate!
00:45:27.250,00:45:29.500,-You're not coming! -I'm not asking you!
00:45:29.583,00:45:31.375,I'm telling you what's gonna happen.
00:45:31.458,00:45:32.458,Come here.
00:45:34.708,00:45:41.541,"Listen to me. As someone who's seen what this looks like, this is not a path you wanna go down. I'm not gonna let you try."
00:45:42.166,00:45:43.375,You're gonna stay put.
00:45:43.458,00:45:46.083,We'll look for your friend. I'll see you when we get out.
00:45:46.166,00:45:49.416,"-Okay? -No. No, not okay."
00:45:49.500,00:45:50.416,You listen.
00:45:51.041,00:45:52.291,I'm going in either way.
00:45:52.875,00:45:55.166,"I can go in with you, and you can keep me safe."
00:45:55.250,00:46:00.916,"-Kate. -Or-- Or… I'll just sneak in after you, and I'll probably die."
00:46:02.000,00:46:03.375,The choice is yours.
00:46:05.375,00:46:07.208,"What's it gonna be, Dad?"
00:46:21.083,00:46:23.000,"If we see your friend, great."
00:46:23.791,00:46:27.500,But you are not to run off looking for her. This is life or death.
00:46:27.583,00:46:31.125,"And if you screw around, some of these people are gonna die."
00:46:31.208,00:46:32.208,You understand that?
00:46:32.291,00:46:33.958,And they've got families too.
00:46:34.625,00:46:38.833,"So you are never, ever to leave my sight."
00:46:38.916,00:46:40.666,Those are my terms. Are we clear?
00:46:43.250,00:46:45.541,Yeah. We're clear.
00:46:49.125,00:46:53.916,"Guys, this is Kate, newest member of the team."
00:46:54.583,00:46:56.500,-Hey. Hello. -How's it going?
00:46:57.583,00:46:59.125,"Scott, what the fuck?"
00:47:04.000,00:47:07.041,The bomb that's coming to kill you? Is that what you're talking about?
00:47:07.125,00:47:08.500,That's the last bus.
00:47:08.583,00:47:10.958,"Go, Speedy Gonzales! Arriba."
00:47:14.166,00:47:16.708,-We're going to need one more guy. -For what?
00:47:16.791,00:47:19.458,You don't know what it's like in there. Not anymore.
00:47:19.541,00:47:22.666,-The team's big enough-- -Trust me. We need another person.
00:47:25.958,00:47:27.458,What the hell's going on here?
00:47:32.166,00:47:33.750,You want to make 20 grand?
00:47:33.833,00:47:35.125,Twenty thousand dollars?
00:47:36.875,00:47:38.750,"Yeah, I'll make 20 fucking grand."
00:47:43.000,00:47:45.791,I don't fucking get it. Why the fuck would she bring him?
00:47:45.875,00:47:48.333,"Honey, easy with the f-bombs, okay?"
00:47:49.958,00:47:53.375,We're about to march into a sea of dead people and commit grand larceny.
00:47:53.458,00:47:55.833,-But excuse me for swearing. -That's for you.
00:48:00.541,00:48:01.416,I got this.
00:48:02.708,00:48:03.833,Whoo!
00:48:03.916,00:48:05.458,"We're gonna have some fun, yeah?"
00:48:06.958,00:48:09.958,"I'm telling you, you got the right guy for this."
00:48:11.333,00:48:16.875,"And also, if you happen to get scared in there or nervous, I want you to stay close to me."
00:48:16.958,00:48:18.750,-Mm-hmm. -I got you.
00:48:23.208,00:48:24.291,"What's up, bro?"
00:48:25.083,00:48:27.041,Gas tank. You carry that.
00:48:29.958,00:48:36.833,"Don't ever touch my saw again, okay? Don't ever talk to her again… bro."
00:48:50.833,00:48:52.250,The fuck you looking at?
00:49:21.583,00:49:22.458,Behind me.
00:49:30.458,00:49:32.750,"Put your gun up, idiot."
00:49:34.250,00:49:35.875,Hey. It's not too late to go back.
00:49:55.458,00:49:56.583,what's left of them.
00:49:59.958,00:50:01.666,What happened to them exactly?
00:50:03.083,00:50:05.291,Weren't smart enough to get out of the sun.
00:50:05.375,00:50:07.666,You should see what happens when it rains.
00:50:07.750,00:50:09.958,"For a few hours, they all come back to life."
00:50:11.583,00:50:12.625,"Oh, Scheisse!"
00:50:14.125,00:50:15.541,"Okay, let's go. Come on."
00:50:16.833,00:50:21.958,How… how much rain is… Tourists.
00:50:26.041,00:50:28.125,"Hey, you're Lilly, right?"
00:50:30.083,00:50:31.875,You sure know your way around here.
00:50:31.958,00:50:33.333,"Well, what's it to you?"
00:50:33.416,00:50:34.833,"Well, maybe a lot."
00:50:36.166,00:50:38.333,How much you know about how these things operate?
00:50:38.416,00:50:39.625,Everything there is.
00:51:18.791,00:51:20.000,Do you hear that?
00:51:22.625,00:51:25.291,-What the hell is that? -Get behind the car! Go!
00:51:42.625,00:51:43.541,What is this?
00:51:44.166,00:51:45.166,Valentine.
00:51:45.750,00:51:46.833,Valentine?
00:51:56.291,00:51:57.583,That's crossing the line.
00:52:33.583,00:52:34.625,Clear.
00:52:41.208,00:52:43.000,She was one of Siegfried and Roy's.
00:52:43.083,00:52:44.833,She guards the beginning of their territory.
00:52:45.625,00:52:48.208,-Is there another way around? -Not really.
00:52:55.416,00:52:57.625,"Hey, Cummings. Let me see your gun for a second."
00:52:57.708,00:52:59.208,What? No shot.
00:53:01.833,00:53:04.291,I like it. It's beautiful.
00:53:06.416,00:53:07.458,It's reliable too.
00:53:08.041,00:53:09.583,"-Oh, yeah? -Yeah."
00:53:13.291,00:53:14.416,Can I touch it?
00:53:15.500,00:53:17.291,-You wanna touch it? -Yeah.
00:53:19.416,00:53:21.000,Just for a second.
00:53:21.625,00:53:23.125,Just for a second.
00:53:35.125,00:53:37.875,"I would say I was hoping I wouldn't have to do that, but I'd be lying."
00:53:37.958,00:53:40.000,-What are you talking about? -What is she doing?
00:53:40.083,00:53:41.541,She just shot me. Shoot her!
00:53:41.625,00:53:44.791,They'll know we're here. They won't care so long as we play by their rules.
00:53:47.583,00:53:49.666,"If we wanna go further, we have to make a trade."
00:53:51.208,00:53:54.166,Yes. An offering to show our subservience.
00:54:04.458,00:54:06.083,You're right. They don't think.
00:54:06.166,00:54:09.291,They just move and eat. But we're talking about the other ones.
00:54:09.375,00:54:13.041,-The alphas. -Yes. They're smarter. They're faster.
00:54:13.125,00:54:16.041,They're organized. Straight out of your fucking nightmares.
00:54:17.250,00:54:20.250,You all keep talking about the city like it's their prison.
00:54:20.333,00:54:22.166,It's not. It's their kingdom.
00:54:22.750,00:54:26.166,They won't mind us poking around the outside so long as we play by their rules.
00:54:28.708,00:54:30.208,I have a mother. I love her.
00:54:30.291,00:54:35.458,"Well, everyone has a mom, you cunt, but not everyone is an abuser lording power over quarantined women."
00:54:46.833,00:54:48.541,"-Oh, fuck, no! No! -She's coming."
00:54:54.125,00:54:56.500,"No. No, no, no. Don't trust her."
00:54:58.041,00:55:00.958,"Help me. Don't go. No, we're a team."
00:55:13.750,00:55:34.458,What the… What… what the fuck?
00:55:47.666,00:55:48.625,Scheisse.
00:55:50.500,00:55:53.208,Help. Shoot this! What the fuck is this thing?
00:55:55.250,00:55:57.625,"Listen, no. No. Hi."
00:56:01.083,00:56:04.250,"Come on. Help me, help me, help me, help me."
00:56:04.333,00:56:06.291,"No! No, no, no, no, no."
00:56:20.625,00:56:22.875,Don't do it. Just stay away.
00:56:24.083,00:56:25.041,What are you doing?
00:56:37.625,00:56:39.791,Go away. Go over there. Go over there.
00:56:48.833,00:56:50.791,Help! No!
00:57:45.750,00:57:47.666,Looks like they're taking him to the Olympus.
00:57:47.750,00:57:49.875,Good. Now we know where not to go.
00:57:54.375,00:58:00.250,"All I know is they take you in there, and you come out like one of them, one of the fast ones."
00:58:03.500,00:58:05.958,"Scott, that could be where Geeta is."
00:58:06.041,00:58:08.000,"Kate, we've already talked about this."
00:58:10.250,00:58:11.166,Fine.
00:58:11.791,00:58:13.041,That's what I thought.
00:58:13.583,00:58:16.708,"So, the shithead buys us passage, and we keep going?"
00:58:16.791,00:58:22.375,"Well, yeah. The shithead should buy us some goodwill, but I'm not about to flaunt it by walking on their streets."
00:58:22.458,00:58:24.583,"If we want to go further, we go indoors."
00:58:24.666,00:58:25.791,"Allez, let's go."
00:58:47.583,00:58:50.416,"Hey, uh, has there been any thought given to triage?"
00:58:50.500,00:58:51.333,What do you mean?
00:58:51.416,00:59:00.875,"Well, I mean, obviously, the German is the most important person 'cause he can open the safe, but barring that, it's got to be me, right?"
00:59:00.958,00:59:03.333,"Because without me, you can't fly the chopper out of here."
00:59:03.416,00:59:06.083,So that would make me second most important.
00:59:06.166,00:59:13.750,"And I don't know if you two are tied for third or whatever, but I'm certainly more important than that guy."
00:59:13.833,00:59:21.208,Sorry. I didn't know you were listening. I am way… I don't trust that guy.
00:59:21.291,00:59:22.708,You know why he was hired?
00:59:22.791,00:59:27.625,"He was hired to keep tabs on us for when we open the safe, that we didn't take the money and run."
00:59:28.250,00:59:29.458,We should be incentivized.
00:59:30.125,00:59:35.708,"I'm not trying to be the bad guy, but we should be incentivized to let him die."
00:59:41.083,00:59:44.041,What? What's everybody looking at me for?
00:59:45.375,00:59:48.583,It's a free country. People can look at whoever they want.
00:59:48.666,00:59:51.791,"Actually, it's not a free country. We're not in America anymore."
00:59:51.875,00:59:52.750,Haven't you heard?
00:59:52.833,00:59:56.833,"Which technically makes it an even freer country, right?"
01:00:00.083,01:00:01.125,Whatever.
01:00:11.125,01:00:12.291,Stay away from me!
01:00:39.041,01:00:40.416,What the fuck?
01:00:58.041,01:00:59.250,What is that?
01:01:16.208,01:01:17.166,Hey.
01:01:18.458,01:01:20.375,Hey. Let me talk to you for a second.
01:01:26.250,01:01:28.041,Okay. Okay.
01:01:50.833,01:01:52.000,What the fuck?
01:02:02.041,01:02:02.916,No.
01:02:04.416,01:02:05.333,No.
01:02:07.208,01:02:10.041,"No. No, no!"
01:02:10.625,01:02:12.500,"Okay. Okay, look."
01:02:12.583,01:03:08.416,Let's just talk turkey for a second. I-- Don't shine the light in their eyes.
01:03:09.583,01:03:11.708,I've seen this before. They're hibernating.
01:03:12.791,01:03:15.791,"If we can't see them, how are we supposed to move forward?"
01:03:17.000,01:03:18.208,I'll mark us a path.
01:03:41.875,01:03:42.708,Go for it.
01:03:43.375,01:03:45.458,Why? You want to check out my ass?
01:03:45.541,01:03:48.916,No. I don't trust you to have our backs if shit goes bad.
01:03:49.000,01:03:51.666,"I've been watching you, and you're up to something."
01:03:51.750,01:03:57.166,"When we all get to the casino, I think we need to have a little conversation about what exactly your role is here."
01:03:57.250,01:03:58.458,Knock yourself out.
01:04:30.916,01:04:32.208,"Gotcha, bitch."
01:08:41.750,01:08:42.625,Bitch.
01:08:43.416,01:08:44.541,Fuck!
01:08:53.708,01:08:54.833,This way!
01:09:05.541,01:09:08.166,-What happened? What did you do? -I didn't do anything.
01:09:08.250,01:09:10.083,She started shooting. I wasn't close to her.
01:09:10.166,01:09:12.583,Bullshit! She was back there with you! I know she was!
01:09:12.666,01:09:13.916,-Buddy… -What happened?
01:09:14.000,01:09:15.458,-You don't want to-- -Motherfucker!
01:09:26.833,01:09:29.708,She's gone! Come on. Leave her! She's dead!
01:09:30.958,01:09:33.791,Chambers! Chambers!
01:09:35.500,01:09:36.583,Come on!
01:09:50.916,01:09:51.916,Go!
01:09:52.000,01:09:54.958,Run! Run!
01:10:25.208,01:10:28.166,Guzman. Guz! She's gone.
01:10:28.250,01:10:30.250,"We gotta move. Come on, move!"
01:12:04.583,01:12:06.041,"There's no way Geeta's alive, right?"
01:12:06.125,01:12:07.750,"I mean, look at these things."
01:12:08.625,01:12:10.916,Don't be so sure. I brought a guy in once.
01:12:11.000,01:12:13.500,Lost sight of him. Had to leave him. I thought he was dead.
01:12:13.583,01:12:16.416,"Then three days later, he came walking back out."
01:12:19.041,01:12:20.166,What happened to him?
01:12:22.958,01:12:25.208,Shoved him in a room with two other people.
01:12:25.291,01:12:27.416,"The leader, he came for them one by one."
01:12:28.291,01:12:30.750,"If my guy hadn't escaped, he would have been next."
01:12:32.166,01:12:34.041,So that's a pretty common theme for you?
01:12:34.125,01:12:35.500,Leaving people behind.
01:12:36.083,01:12:38.291,Do you think I enjoy having to leave people?
01:12:40.208,01:12:42.333,I'm doing what I can to make things right.
01:12:55.916,01:12:57.333,Come here. Look at this.
01:13:02.791,01:13:06.666,"Is that… Yeah, another set of blueprints to the safe."
01:13:14.291,01:13:16.208,Tanaka had other teams here before us.
01:13:21.291,01:13:22.708,Do you know anything about this?
01:13:24.625,01:13:25.791,That's news to me.
01:13:34.708,01:13:35.958,"Peters, get up to the roof."
01:13:36.041,01:13:39.375,"Get that chopper running as fast as possible. Cruz, go with her."
01:13:40.250,01:13:41.541,She talks too much.
01:13:41.625,01:13:44.166,"Look, I'm excited to see my friends again, okay?"
01:13:44.250,01:13:45.083,Sue me.
01:13:46.166,01:13:49.458,"Me and the coyote will do a perimeter check, board up the doors."
01:13:49.541,01:13:52.166,Yeah. Kate and I are gonna find the generators.
01:13:52.250,01:13:55.541,Backup gennie's on the third-floor roof. That's gonna be your safer bet.
01:13:55.625,01:13:56.958,Third-floor roof. Got it.
01:13:57.958,01:13:59.291,"Van, get Dieter down to the vault."
01:13:59.375,01:14:00.666,Take Guzman with you.
01:14:00.750,01:14:02.083,Roger that.
01:14:02.166,01:14:07.041,"Dieter, access card for the outer doors to the safe and the service elevators."
01:14:07.125,01:14:09.250,It's by the cashiers windows that way.
01:14:10.541,01:14:12.416,This should get you inside. Here.
01:14:13.833,01:14:14.666,Thank you.
01:14:22.416,01:14:24.958,All right. Everybody knows what they're doing. Let's get it done.
01:14:25.041,01:14:25.916,"Yes, sir."
01:14:38.375,01:14:40.083,What a hunk of junk.
01:14:42.375,01:14:44.041,"No la vayas a cagar, my friend."
01:14:46.666,01:14:47.500,Bye.
01:14:51.000,01:14:52.833,What the hell is this?
01:14:53.625,01:14:56.500,Spend all his money on that fucking miniature?
01:15:12.416,01:15:13.833,It's perverse.
01:15:19.291,01:15:20.166,What was it?
01:15:21.791,01:15:23.625,Guilt finally get the better of you?
01:15:24.166,01:15:26.041,One too many out there to die?
01:15:26.125,01:15:28.000,"Matter of fact, yes, it has."
01:15:29.208,01:15:33.333,"That mom Kate's looking for, did you shoot her in the leg too?"
01:15:34.666,01:15:36.708,"No, I just lost her."
01:15:36.791,01:15:41.541,I've never left anyone I didn't have to or who didn't deserve it.
01:15:41.625,01:15:43.875,You have no idea what I've seen in those camps.
01:15:43.958,01:15:45.833,What those people have to do to survive.
01:15:45.916,01:15:48.375,"At least within these walls, the rules are clear."
01:15:48.458,01:15:50.500,You don't see them fucking each other over.
01:15:56.000,01:16:03.541,If you screw me… two between the eyes.
01:16:03.625,01:16:04.708,Two? Why two?
01:16:05.500,01:16:07.000,The second one's just for fun.
01:16:12.625,01:16:13.666,What happens now?
01:16:14.916,01:16:15.750,We wait.
01:16:20.125,01:16:20.958,Do what?
01:16:24.958,01:16:29.125,"You know, all those things they were saying… about me after."
01:16:29.208,01:16:31.625,-I want to make sure you know I loved her. -Yeah.
01:16:32.250,01:16:33.541,We loved each other.
01:16:36.791,01:16:39.958,"If I ever made it seem like that wasn't the case, I'm sorry."
01:16:41.291,01:16:42.750,I got it. It's okay.
01:16:49.250,01:16:50.750,You did what you had to do.
01:16:51.625,01:16:55.458,She was one of them. It… It's fine. Okay?
01:16:59.125,01:16:59.958,Wait.
01:17:00.625,01:17:04.458,You think that's why I haven't been talking to you all these years?
01:17:05.708,01:17:17.583,"Well, it seemed like the… What you did and what happened to her, I never blamed you for that, ever."
01:17:18.375,01:17:19.916,"Well, I don't… I don't get it."
01:17:20.000,01:17:22.416,"If it wasn't what happened, what the hell was it?"
01:17:27.250,01:17:33.708,It's not the… It's not the fact that… you killed my mother.
01:17:40.333,01:17:42.875,"It's that you never showed up after, okay?"
01:17:45.000,01:17:47.041,"You weren't there, Scott."
01:17:47.125,01:17:48.750,You didn't call. You didn't visit.
01:17:48.833,01:17:51.666,You didn't… talk about it.
01:17:53.625,01:17:54.791,You didn't comfort me.
01:18:01.166,01:18:08.875,"It's 'cause every time I looked at you, I just saw her and… It hurt like hell."
01:18:14.416,01:18:15.541,Hurt like hell.
01:18:19.000,01:18:26.375,"And then when I tried to come back around, you just… You seemed like you didn't want me there, so I assumed I should stay gone."
01:18:31.583,01:18:36.208,"You know, maybe there's a chance we could still… Still what?"
01:18:40.666,01:18:41.500,I don't know.
01:18:43.750,01:18:45.500,Maybe you could look into college somewhere.
01:18:46.666,01:18:49.083,We shouldn't need money. I could open a restaurant.
01:18:50.083,01:18:51.541,A new food truck.
01:18:52.791,01:18:54.000,Just have a life.
01:18:54.708,01:19:00.250,"I was thinking, uh… I was thinking artisan grilled cheese sandwiches."
01:19:01.041,01:19:02.750,Artisan grilled cheese?
01:19:03.708,01:19:05.000,"Yeah, what do you think?"
01:19:05.875,01:19:06.791,Mmm.
01:19:10.833,01:19:26.916,"Yeah, uh… I've spent so long hating you that I can't just turn that off."
01:19:29.666,01:19:31.375,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:20:27.666,01:20:30.041,I got the bride. I got the bride.
01:20:30.625,01:20:31.958,I shot her three times.
01:20:32.041,01:20:33.250,"Actually, it was four."
01:20:33.333,01:20:34.166,Four.
01:20:38.375,01:20:42.000,"Not zombie-killing material, my ass, Mr. Vanderohe."
01:20:49.125,01:20:51.958,"Sorry, sir. Um… All right."
01:20:52.750,01:20:53.583,Okay.
01:21:18.500,01:21:19.916,Götterdämmerung.
01:21:20.875,01:21:23.208,You've been here in the dark waiting for me.
01:21:27.041,01:21:29.000,You're so beautiful. See?
01:21:32.291,01:21:33.125,"Oh, look."
01:21:34.250,01:21:36.416,There's another team of grave robbers.
01:21:36.500,01:21:38.166,They tried to cut their way in.
01:21:40.666,01:21:44.250,You stupid poor skeletons.
01:21:45.458,01:21:46.875,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
01:21:48.208,01:21:51.750,"Oh, no. All they managed to do is to screw up the card reader."
01:21:54.625,01:21:57.250,-Huh? -Think about it. Us.
01:22:00.333,01:22:01.833,"I mean, look at them. It's us."
01:22:02.583,01:22:21.500,"It could be us in another timeline, and we're caught in some infinite loop of fighting and dying, fighting and dying, fighting and dying. And Tanaka… the puppet master."
01:22:21.583,01:22:22.416,Devil. God.
01:22:23.583,01:22:33.500,"And we, you, me, Guz, and the rest of the team, simply pawns in some perverse play where we're destined to repeat our failures."
01:22:34.916,01:22:45.166,"And finally, in some mind-bending, ironic reveal… it all begins again."
01:22:45.916,01:22:46.750,Cool.
01:22:47.583,01:22:48.416,Boom.
01:23:19.500,01:23:20.833,Amazing.
01:23:26.500,01:23:27.333,There.
01:23:28.791,01:23:31.166,That's where the first pressure trigger is.
01:23:31.250,01:23:34.083,"It's some kind of a booby trap, trust me."
01:23:34.791,01:23:48.958,If we could find something to trigger it… -There. -I see.
01:23:56.083,01:23:58.333,"By the way, I love your hair."
01:24:01.375,01:24:02.208,Thanks.
01:24:17.041,01:24:17.875,"Oh, God."
01:24:23.208,01:24:24.166,"Oh, God."
01:25:13.500,01:25:14.541,Gotcha.
01:25:40.500,01:25:41.500,Get off me!
01:25:51.916,01:25:54.625,-You okay? -Yeah. Yeah.
01:25:58.041,01:25:58.875,Yeah.
01:26:10.291,01:26:11.125,Good luck.
01:26:13.791,01:26:14.958,"Hey, gorgeous."
01:26:15.541,01:26:17.250,"Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:26:17.333,01:26:18.708,Okay. Oh.
01:26:18.791,01:26:21.000,"Easy, easy, easy. Hey, hey, hey."
01:26:22.625,01:26:24.416,Okay. Yeah.
01:26:49.041,01:26:50.083,What are you doing?
01:26:56.416,01:26:58.958,You said you just needed a vial of her blood.
01:27:02.166,01:27:07.333,"You know how much the whole head of one of these things is worth to my boss, to the government?"
01:27:07.833,01:27:08.833,Mwah!
01:27:09.625,01:27:13.041,"In the right hands, this is the power to make more of them."
01:27:13.125,01:27:15.375,The power to control your own zombie army.
01:27:15.458,01:27:16.875,That's the ultimate WMD.
01:27:18.583,01:27:21.000,"Well, you want your deal or not?"
01:27:23.791,01:27:24.625,Huh?
01:27:26.833,01:27:27.791,That's what I thought.
01:27:29.833,01:27:31.958,So you keep your goddamn mouth shut.
01:27:34.000,01:27:35.041,"Okay, we need to go."
01:27:35.125,01:27:38.750,Why? They gonna come looking for her if she doesn't radio back to base?
01:27:38.833,01:27:41.083,Her death cry. They'll have heard it.
01:27:41.166,01:27:43.291,"Once they find her body, our trade is off."
01:27:44.958,01:27:46.291,What are they gonna do?
01:27:47.458,01:27:48.416,I don't know.
01:28:04.500,01:28:05.666,Off you go.
01:28:07.625,01:28:10.458,"Come on, go get it. That's right."
01:28:31.541,01:28:32.500,I… I'm okay.
01:28:34.375,01:28:35.833,Everything's fine.
01:28:54.041,01:28:56.125,Who's got the hot hand?
01:28:56.708,01:28:59.166,"All right, here we go. You can taste it."
01:29:01.125,01:29:02.666,"Okay, let's go get it."
01:29:08.583,01:29:09.458,"Watch this, Guz."
01:29:15.375,01:29:16.916,"You see that, Diet?"
01:29:20.083,01:29:25.958,And the deterrent should be releasing right… now.
01:29:36.916,01:29:37.833,"Oh, Scheisse!"
01:29:41.916,01:29:44.666,That was supposed to be nonlethal.
01:29:44.750,01:29:47.041,"-That has to be illegal, right? -Good old Tanaka."
01:29:47.125,01:29:48.666,Guess he wasn't screwing around.
01:29:49.541,01:29:51.833,"So is that it, Dieter, huh? Is it safe now?"
01:29:52.416,01:29:54.000,"I think, probably."
01:30:12.916,01:30:14.208,Good luck with that.
01:30:15.625,01:30:18.083,"Oh, come on, Guz. It was just getting fun."
01:30:29.750,01:30:31.000,Yes.
01:30:31.083,01:30:33.916,Yes! Yes!
01:30:34.000,01:30:36.166,Come on! Come on!
01:30:36.250,01:30:38.250,Yes! Yes!
01:30:47.416,01:30:49.791,You filthy piece of shit.
01:30:50.375,01:30:51.250,Fuck!
01:30:56.458,01:30:59.916,"Oh, um… You okay there, Dieter?"
01:31:05.500,01:31:07.041,-Yeah. Absolutely. -Thank you.
01:31:07.125,01:31:10.125,"One, two, three."
01:31:21.875,01:31:25.916,it will be either destruction or renewal.
01:31:30.416,01:31:32.666,Death… or rebirth.
01:31:35.666,01:31:38.916,"That's heavy, brother. But I dig it."
01:31:39.875,01:31:47.750,"The decision came down to the wire, but ultimately, the president caved to the pressures to move the date of the bombing off of the holiday."
01:31:47.833,01:31:59.250,"This marked a reversal of his earlier position that dropping the nuke on the Fourth would be, quote, Really cool and the ultimate fireworks show, and quote, Actually kind of patriotic if you think about it."
01:31:59.333,01:32:11.666,"Due to fears that mounting anger from humanitarian groups would cause the bombing to be postponed indefinitely, the administration has made the dramatic choice to not postpone the bombing but rather to move it up by a full 24 hours."
01:32:18.875,01:32:19.708,What?
01:32:23.125,01:32:44.500,…the International Society of Elvis Impersonators… We got a problem.
01:32:45.375,01:32:46.791,They moved the bomb up.
01:32:46.875,01:32:50.208,"Oh, nice. I'm glad they decided to move the nuclear bomb up."
01:32:50.291,01:32:52.166,I was getting kind of antsy.
01:32:54.500,01:32:55.791,How's it going up there?
01:33:02.083,01:33:04.625,Good. I actually found a pool.
01:33:04.708,01:33:06.625,Been working on my tan.
01:33:06.708,01:33:09.208,Gotta even this shit out. You know what I'm talking about?
01:33:10.166,01:33:11.666,How's it going over there?
01:33:12.375,01:33:14.208,Get the safe open yet?
01:33:14.291,01:33:18.208,"It's a little slower than we thought, but… we're close."
01:33:18.791,01:33:22.958,"All right. I'm just giving it a wash and wax, so hurry up."
01:33:23.041,01:33:24.500,"Just waiting on you, man."
01:33:27.375,01:33:28.625,Son of a bitch.
01:33:53.333,01:33:54.750,"Scott, he's working, man."
01:34:00.000,01:34:02.583,You see this? The four locks?
01:34:02.666,01:34:04.250,You know what that is?
01:34:07.166,01:34:10.458,"It's a rotating randomization mechanism, right, Mr. Vanderohe?"
01:34:14.125,01:34:19.083,"You, Mr. Sausagefinger… You just made me mess up, and now we're back to ground zero."
01:34:20.208,01:34:22.416,"If you mess it up again, it locks forever."
01:34:22.500,01:34:24.250,You understand? Forever.
01:34:24.833,01:34:28.375,"Okay, how long will it take you to open it?"
01:34:44.000,01:34:45.750,-Thirty minutes. -Okay.
01:34:45.833,01:34:48.916,Thirty minutes of silence.
01:34:54.583,01:34:57.958,"Mr. Vanderohe, can you please keep your team quiet?"
01:34:58.041,01:35:00.291,I need to concentrate. Thank you.
01:35:07.708,01:35:09.791,"Thirty minutes, that's not bad. Right?"
01:35:09.875,01:35:12.500,Nuclear bomb drops on us in an hour and 20 minutes.
01:35:12.583,01:35:16.958,"Right, which gives us an hour to get to the helicopter and get out of here."
01:35:18.166,01:35:20.333,-That's plenty of time. -Plenty.
01:35:20.416,01:35:23.500,What's the alternative? Run for the edge of the city?
01:35:23.583,01:35:24.875,I don't think we'll make it.
01:35:24.958,01:35:27.791,"No, we don't need an alt. We trust him."
01:35:31.750,01:35:32.875,"Right, Van?"
01:35:37.958,01:35:40.375,"Yeah, no, no, no. He's got it."
01:36:40.333,01:36:42.208,Must be the fire egress.
01:36:42.291,01:36:44.000,"Yeah, I got it."
01:36:45.125,01:36:48.666,It's probably how the last team got in and how those shamblers got down here.
01:36:48.750,01:36:50.166,"Hey, what do you think about tofu?"
01:36:50.250,01:36:51.125,What?
01:36:51.875,01:36:53.625,Tofu. My next food truck.
01:36:53.708,01:36:56.125,"I was thinking, can make anything out of tofu."
01:36:56.208,01:37:00.375,"Tofu burgers, tofu fries, tofu milkshake, tofu cheesecake."
01:37:01.083,01:37:03.750,I don't know what that is. Tofu cheesecake. I don't know.
01:37:04.333,01:37:07.625,"I thought maybe, since everyone's going vegan now, you know."
01:37:07.708,01:37:10.375,Humans are figuring out they're not at the top of the food chain.
01:37:10.458,01:37:11.750,What do you think?
01:37:11.833,01:37:13.125,"Yeah, it's… it's okay."
01:37:28.916,01:37:30.541,How much we got in the cart?
01:37:30.625,01:37:32.083,"I'd say 200 grand, easy."
01:37:40.791,01:37:43.291,That is the most money I've ever held in my hand.
01:37:43.875,01:37:48.041,"As soon as that door opens, it's a rounding error, toilet paper."
01:37:48.125,01:37:49.958,I'll take it if you don't want it.
01:37:50.041,01:37:51.541,"No, that's cool. I got it."
01:38:44.833,01:38:45.833,"Oh, my God."
01:38:57.875,01:39:01.000,I've done it. I've done it.
01:39:01.083,01:39:04.041,"Wait, what? You did it? Like… like, did it did it?"
01:39:08.000,01:39:09.000,He did it.
01:39:12.625,01:39:14.708,As it was inevitable that we won.
01:39:16.541,01:39:18.958,"Mr. Vanderohe, would you do me the honor?"
01:40:35.375,01:40:37.041,"All right, come on. Let's go, guys."
01:40:37.916,01:40:40.208,We got about 20 minutes before this place is dust.
01:40:50.541,01:40:52.416,It's in a good fucking place.
01:42:11.916,01:42:13.625,"Just like old times, right?"
01:42:13.708,01:42:17.041,"Well, not just like old times but just as crazy."
01:42:17.791,01:42:18.666,Yeah.
01:42:23.250,01:42:24.291,"I don't know, Scott."
01:42:24.916,01:42:28.458,"Hey, you can talk to me. What's up?"
01:42:31.791,01:42:33.500,You're really stupid. You know that?
01:42:36.750,01:42:39.166,"I didn't come here for the money, dumb shit."
01:42:39.666,01:42:42.291,"I mean, don't get me wrong, I'll take the millions."
01:42:42.958,01:42:45.875,But… I came here for you.
01:42:48.125,01:42:54.125,"I thought we could have had something, but then you just… went away."
01:42:56.875,01:43:00.666,It's just that seeing you again is just… bringing it all back.
01:43:04.958,01:43:06.625,I'm happy.
01:43:06.708,01:43:08.416,"Well, I'm… I'm fine."
01:43:10.250,01:43:18.291,I just thought that… maybe… I thought I'd fucked that up… forever.
01:43:21.083,01:43:22.583,Forever is a long time.
01:43:23.458,01:43:26.041,I'm realizing that I've been wrong about everything.
01:43:27.333,01:43:29.750,"About you and me, me and Kate."
01:43:36.500,01:43:37.583,Have you seen Kate?
01:43:40.041,01:43:41.041,Kate?
01:45:31.666,01:45:32.666,Kate!
01:45:34.750,01:45:36.833,Goddamn it! I know where she went.
01:45:39.166,01:45:41.666,-Wait for the rest-- -There's nothing to think about.
01:45:41.750,01:45:44.333,I know where she went. She's my daughter. I'll get her back.
01:45:44.416,01:45:46.375,"-I'm coming with you. -No, you're not."
01:45:46.458,01:45:48.666,I'm not gonna let you go out there alone.
01:45:53.125,01:45:53.958,Thank you.
01:47:15.166,01:47:16.083,What do you think?
01:47:16.166,01:47:17.000,The money.
01:47:17.083,01:47:18.000,The money. Okay.
01:47:19.458,01:47:20.875,"Guzman, cover this corner."
01:47:30.916,01:47:32.000,Fuck!
01:47:32.625,01:47:34.416,"Come on, Dieter! Come on!"
01:47:56.291,01:47:57.958,"Martin, let us out of here."
01:48:02.041,01:48:03.000,Slow learner.
01:48:03.083,01:48:05.500,Tanaka doesn't give a shit about the money.
01:48:06.333,01:48:09.916,What's in this bag is worth ten times what's in that vault.
01:48:10.000,01:48:15.291,"Okay, I'm gonna go kill that dumbass pilot, now that she's fixed the chopper, fly myself out of here."
01:48:15.375,01:48:16.708,Au revoir.
01:48:33.916,01:48:34.833,Fuck.
01:51:28.000,01:51:29.375,Fire in the hole!
01:51:40.041,01:51:41.041,"Hey, baby."
01:51:41.916,01:51:42.833,You still with me?
01:51:44.291,01:51:45.208,"Come on, now."
01:51:48.041,01:51:49.041,Damn it!
01:53:34.875,01:53:37.958,All right. We'll make a run for that elevator. Get up to the roof.
01:54:03.708,01:54:04.708,Go!
01:54:51.333,01:54:52.166,Come on!
01:54:56.208,01:54:57.250,Let's go!
01:57:49.416,01:57:52.333,Come on! Come on!
01:57:54.125,01:57:55.291,Come on.
01:58:00.250,01:58:02.458,Peters! What the hell?
01:58:02.541,01:58:04.125,Give me 30 seconds.
01:58:18.125,01:58:20.666,Martin said he'd let everyone out of the camps if I helped him.
01:58:21.250,01:58:22.500,If I didn't say anything.
01:58:23.500,01:58:24.500,Liar!
01:58:26.500,01:58:27.875,Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
01:58:32.291,01:58:33.500,Go! Now!
01:58:34.125,01:58:35.125,Go!
01:58:40.083,01:58:42.541,"One more step, and I'll blow her head off."
01:58:44.208,01:58:45.750,"Well, more off."
01:58:47.208,01:58:48.208,What are we doing?
01:58:48.916,01:58:49.916,Just go!
01:58:50.625,01:58:51.791,Let's go!
02:00:02.708,02:00:03.750,Goddamn it.
02:00:03.833,02:00:06.125,"Scott, was that a zombie in a goddamn cape?"
02:00:06.208,02:00:07.416,Just fly.
02:00:08.208,02:00:09.541,Where's the money?
02:00:10.458,02:00:11.541,There is no money.
02:00:12.041,02:00:15.916,"But, Peters, Kate's at the Olympus. We got to go get her."
02:00:17.458,02:00:18.958,How much time do we have?
02:00:21.166,02:00:23.416,-We got about nine minutes. -Goddamn it!
02:00:24.833,02:00:31.125,"You son of a bitch! If we do this… you better find her, man."
02:00:58.958,02:00:59.916,"Oh, my God."
02:01:02.208,02:01:04.583,"-Kate. -Geeta, I found you. You're alive."
02:01:07.666,02:01:09.166,"Kate, you came back for me."
02:01:34.125,02:01:35.583,Don't screw me.
02:01:36.208,02:01:37.375,Just go!
02:01:50.166,02:01:51.416,-Are you bitten? -No.
02:01:51.500,02:01:53.833,-Are you bitten? -He hasn't gotten to us yet.
02:01:53.916,02:01:56.791,"Okay, we need to go right now. Come with me. Come with me."
02:01:58.208,02:01:59.166,Okay.
02:02:05.000,02:02:08.333,Kate? Kate?
02:02:09.458,02:02:11.833,Kate! God.
02:02:11.916,02:02:12.958,Fuck!
02:02:31.958,02:02:33.083,Sadie!
02:02:44.708,02:02:45.583,Kate!
02:03:09.750,02:03:10.916,Let's go!
02:04:36.666,02:04:37.750,She left us.
02:04:39.541,02:04:42.250,Goddamn it. She left us.
02:04:59.541,02:05:01.333,"Wait, you guys… you guys hear that?"
02:05:21.625,02:05:28.083,"I know, I know. Somewhere between leaving your ass and saving my own, I developed a conscience."
02:05:28.166,02:05:29.375,It's exhausting.
02:05:31.041,02:05:33.083,"Get in. Come on, let's go."
02:06:05.291,02:06:06.166,Hold on!
02:06:49.291,02:06:50.458,No!
02:07:58.583,02:07:59.625,No!
02:10:29.666,02:10:30.875,Dad?
02:10:35.625,02:10:37.375,Hey. Hey.
02:10:39.583,02:10:56.708,"Dad, I'm right… Oh, thank God you're okay."
02:11:01.333,02:11:03.916,"Hey. Hey, it's not so bad."
02:11:04.000,02:11:04.958,It's not so bad.
02:11:06.166,02:11:11.875,It's fine. It's not as deep… You don't have to do that.
02:11:14.375,02:11:15.375,Don't do that.
02:11:19.375,02:11:20.625,I know what this means.
02:11:22.500,02:11:23.541,Don't.
02:11:28.333,02:11:29.625,I've been thinking.
02:11:32.708,02:11:35.208,"I've been thinking a lot, Kate."
02:11:39.666,02:11:41.500,It's got to be lobster rolls.
02:11:46.208,02:11:47.625,"You know, the food truck."
02:11:48.875,02:11:50.041,Yeah.
02:11:50.125,02:11:51.458,Scott's lobster rolls.
02:11:52.791,02:11:55.166,"'Cause everybody loves a goddamn lobster roll, right?"
02:11:56.541,02:11:59.333,Everyone loves a goddamn lobster roll.
02:12:01.500,02:12:02.500,Hey.
02:12:04.250,02:12:05.875,"Hey, I got something for you."
02:12:16.875,02:12:17.875,Here.
02:12:18.708,02:12:25.000,"I know it's not millions, but this should get Geeta's kids out of the camp for good."
02:12:25.083,02:12:27.625,"Here. Here, you take that."
02:12:29.291,02:12:30.750,You go and make it right.
02:12:39.041,02:12:40.666,I'm so goddamn proud of you.
02:12:43.875,02:12:45.166,"I love you, Kate."
02:12:51.000,02:12:52.125,I'm sorry I ran.
02:12:54.083,02:12:55.583,I'm such a coward.
02:13:04.958,02:13:06.708,You're the bravest man I know.
02:13:14.958,02:13:16.166,I'm so sorry.
02:13:20.916,02:13:21.791,Hey.
02:13:22.750,02:13:24.708,-Yeah? -Let me just look at you.
02:13:43.583,02:13:45.541,Dad. Dad.
02:15:45.291,02:15:46.916,Hey!
02:15:52.958,02:15:53.791,Hey!
02:17:00.291,02:17:03.500,"I'm sorry, sir. Unfortunately, that's a privately owned aircraft."
02:17:03.583,02:17:07.250,I'm not able to just rent you that plane.
02:17:21.750,02:17:23.166,Let me see what I can do.
02:17:25.166,02:17:26.958,"Well, that is amazing."
02:17:28.250,02:17:31.500,"Honestly, how do you ladies make that in that little kitchen back there?"
02:17:31.583,02:17:32.666,It's like magic.
02:17:32.750,02:17:33.750,Voilà.
02:17:35.208,02:17:37.083,We should… we should make a toast.
02:17:38.166,02:17:39.875,"Oh, we can't. We're working."
02:17:40.500,02:17:45.833,"No, no. Just one… One glass, one toast. It would make one happy man."
02:17:45.916,02:17:47.208,It'd mean a lot to me.
02:17:51.833,02:18:03.166,"To quote the great Joseph Campbell, he said, It is by going down into the abyss where we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure."
02:18:03.958,02:18:06.041,To the ironic twist of the unknown.
02:18:06.125,02:18:07.708,-Bottoms up. -Cheers.
02:18:07.791,02:18:09.041,Cheers.
02:18:19.208,02:18:20.291,There we go. Okay.
02:18:22.833,02:18:25.791,"-I'm sorry. I'm a little embarrassed. -Okay. It's okay, honey."
02:18:25.875,02:18:27.250,I'm good. I'm good.
02:18:27.333,02:18:28.833,You don't look so good.
02:18:29.916,02:18:31.625,-Long day. -Your skin is really cold.
02:18:31.708,02:18:33.500,"So, I'm gonna let the captain know."
02:18:33.583,02:18:37.041,No. Let me just hit the head and splash some water on my face. I'll be good as gold.
02:18:40.750,02:18:43.250,-Yep. Let's get up. -Okay. Thank you.
02:18:46.416,02:18:48.708,"-Yep, right there. That's it, right there. -Yeah, okay."
02:18:56.333,02:18:57.250,Come on.
02:19:13.958,02:19:14.791,Ooh.
02:19:18.708,02:19:21.708,We will be beginning our final descent into Mexico City.
02:19:21.791,02:19:25.208,I'd like to ask you to please return to your seat and fasten your safety belt.
02:19:28.083,02:19:31.375,…and the temperature is 67 degrees.
02:19:32.416,02:19:33.750,Thanks for flying with us.
02:19:36.708,02:19:38.041,Fuck.
00:24:39.041,00:24:40.166,"Thank you, Maria."
00:24:43.166,00:24:45.500,"Sharkey, give her the white loaner."
