00:01:57.408,00:01:59.619,"Game, set and match. You're a champion."
00:02:00.328,00:02:01.162,You're number one.
00:02:02.914,00:02:06.501,"But for most tennis players, that's all it ever is: a dream."
00:02:07.001,00:02:08.753,The reality is another story.
00:02:09.212,00:02:10.171,My story.
00:02:11.673,00:02:13.424,"Now, you see that good-looking fella?"
00:02:13.508,00:02:16.761,"No, not the kid in white, the other tired, good-looking fella."
00:02:17.470,00:02:19.305,"Yeah, him. Well, that's me."
00:02:20.140,00:02:22.350,"British Davis Cup, long time ago."
00:02:22.433,00:02:24.477,"Two singles titles, even longer ago."
00:02:24.978,00:02:27.564,Presently ranked 119th in the world.
00:02:32.861,00:02:35.905,Four million tennis players in the world and I'm 119th.
00:02:36.447,00:02:44.789,"But what that really means is this: 118 guys out there are faster, stronger, better and younger."
00:02:45.582,00:02:46.875,And it gets you thinking.
00:03:00.889,00:03:04.183,"These young guys, where do they get the energy to focus?"
00:03:04.601,00:03:05.435,No fear.
00:03:06.185,00:03:08.062,"You see, the one thing you can't have is fear."
00:03:08.479,00:03:11.399,"And for the first time in my life, I'm afraid."
00:03:11.733,00:03:14.319,Not of losing. I'm not even afraid of the kid.
00:03:14.819,00:03:18.031,I'm afraid of what happens if that ball keeps going by me.
00:03:19.032,00:03:20.158,What happens then?
00:03:21.451,00:03:25.079,"I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of having it engraved."
00:03:29.459,00:03:31.628,"Frankly, my biggest problem is parking."
00:03:31.711,00:03:32.545,Right.
00:03:32.629,00:03:34.923,"Not for you, of course. No, your own space."
00:03:35.006,00:03:36.591,"-Name plate again. -Oh, good."
00:03:37.884,00:03:38.718,"Hello, Ian."
00:03:38.968,00:03:40.261,Is this the young man you were telling us about?
00:03:40.345,00:03:42.263,"Mmm-hmm. Peter Colt, one and only."
00:03:42.972,00:03:45.016,"Once ranked 15th in the world, I hear."
00:03:45.225,00:03:48.478,"Uh, 11th, actually, for the better part of '96."
00:03:49.479,00:03:52.232,"Yes, Peter's got himself a wild card at Wimbledon."
00:03:53.358,00:03:55.526,Then we're hoping he'll be hanging his racket here at the club.
00:03:55.985,00:03:56.819,"Well, we'll see."
00:03:57.195,00:04:00.657,"We shall look forward to giving you a peek at our ground strokes, won't we, ladies?"
00:04:00.949,00:04:02.242,"Oh, do shut up, Sylvia."
00:04:02.659,00:04:03.952,"Good luck at the Championships, young man."
00:04:04.035,00:04:04.953,Thank you very much.
00:04:07.330,00:04:08.748,"-Uh, Peter, Peter. -Yes?"
00:04:08.831,00:04:09.916,Watch the ladies.
00:04:09.999,00:04:11.751,-Occupational hazard. -Of course.
00:04:11.834,00:04:12.919,"Look at this, look at this."
00:04:14.170,00:04:16.172,Completely new hybrid.
00:04:16.256,00:04:18.216,"Yes, developed by the Yanks."
00:04:18.299,00:04:19.634,Firm but springy.
00:04:20.760,00:04:21.636,"Look, Peter."
00:04:23.096,00:04:24.138,I can't wait forever.
00:04:24.472,00:04:28.142,"Um, I mean, there's no one else I'd rather-- Ian, look no further."
00:04:28.643,00:04:29.769,You have your tennis director.
00:04:29.852,00:04:31.729,"Oh, that is splendid."
00:04:32.021,00:04:33.690,So splendid!
00:04:40.613,00:04:42.615,Once ranked 17th in the world.
00:04:42.782,00:04:43.700,Eleventh!
00:04:45.243,00:04:46.536,I was ranked 11th in the world.
00:04:51.249,00:04:54.419,It isn't a killer forehand or serve. Lots of people have those.
00:04:54.877,00:04:56.587,But the great ones have something else.
00:04:57.338,00:04:58.840,Some say it's a supportive family.
00:04:58.923,00:05:01.968,Others say it's being hungry. Really hungry.
00:05:02.760,00:05:05.013,"But as you can see, I've never been hungry."
00:05:06.597,00:05:07.432,Hello?
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.475,And as far as the supportive family goes...
00:05:10.393,00:05:12.061,Mum? Dad?
00:05:14.480,00:05:15.315,Anybody home?
00:05:34.459,00:05:36.127,"Life still giving you trouble, is it?"
00:05:36.419,00:05:39.464,"Deep Throat, Director's Cut. Absolute classic."
00:05:40.006,00:05:40.840,What... Hey!
00:05:48.306,00:05:49.223,"You all right, Dad?"
00:05:52.769,00:05:54.270,Have you got our Wimbledon tickets sorted yet?
00:05:54.353,00:05:56.939,"'Cause, you know, I don't wanna miss your grand finale."
00:05:57.190,00:05:58.441,"Interesting bit of trivia, actually."
00:05:58.524,00:06:01.444,Do you know that I've never won a match at Wimbledon with my family in attendance?
00:06:02.612,00:06:03.446,Nope.
00:06:03.529,00:06:04.614,"Oh, she's not gonna like that."
00:06:04.989,00:06:05.990,What won't I like?
00:06:06.074,00:06:06.908,"Hello, darling."
00:06:07.742,00:06:09.160,You're looking rather gaunt.
00:06:09.410,00:06:11.204,Thank you. Why is Dad so upset?
00:06:12.246,00:06:13.331,Ridiculous man.
00:06:13.706,00:06:16.542,For some reason he believes I'm having an affair with Eliot Larkin.
00:06:16.626,00:06:19.837,"Mother, he saw you snogging in the club car park."
00:06:19.921,00:06:20.838,"Oh, that would do it."
00:06:21.255,00:06:22.215,Not in the kitchen.
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.676,"I wanted your father to see us, that was the point."
00:06:25.760,00:06:28.721,"Shake him out of his stupor, compel him to act."
00:06:30.723,00:06:34.060,"I hear you're planning to retire, to babysit a bunch of old ladies."
00:06:34.685,00:06:38.022,"Not what your father and I had in mind all those years ago, cheering you on."
00:06:38.106,00:06:39.440,And do you know why?
00:06:39.774,00:06:42.318,Because I believe you to be a truly great tennis player.
00:06:42.401,00:06:43.236,"Oh, God."
00:06:43.319,00:06:44.987,You've just always been afraid to admit it to yourself.
00:06:45.071,00:06:46.531,"I'm not afraid, I'm old."
00:06:46.614,00:06:48.825,"Oh, don't be absurd, 31 is not old."
00:06:48.908,00:06:51.285,It is. In tennis years I might as well be your age.
00:06:51.369,00:06:52.328,"Thank you, dear."
00:06:52.662,00:06:57.083,And I'm tired of hotels and I'm tired of airports and long-distance love affairs that never go anywhere and...
00:06:57.166,00:06:58.000,Losing?
00:06:58.876,00:07:00.211,"Yeah, losing. Thanks, Carl."
00:07:01.212,00:07:02.338,Now tell her about the tickets.
00:07:02.755,00:07:03.589,Tickets?
00:07:04.632,00:07:06.425,"Oh, God, you really are a wanker, aren't you?"
00:07:07.760,00:07:08.886,Harsh but fair.
00:07:13.391,00:07:15.101,Do you know why? What does he think?
00:07:15.184,00:07:17.311,Does he think we're gonna sit here watching it on television?
00:07:19.230,00:07:20.898,"Dad, what are you doing up there?"
00:07:21.399,00:07:22.900,I should have moved up here years ago.
00:07:26.779,00:07:28.573,"Right. Well, I'm off up to Wimbledon, then."
00:07:28.656,00:07:29.490,Righto.
00:07:31.951,00:07:33.077,-Peter? -Yeah?
00:07:34.912,00:07:38.332,Remember I always told you that tennis was a gentleman's game?
00:07:38.875,00:07:39.709,Yeah.
00:07:40.418,00:07:41.294,Total bollocks.
00:07:42.170,00:07:43.546,Everything I ever told you.
00:07:44.213,00:07:45.339,Total bollocks.
00:07:48.718,00:07:49.594,"Right, then."
00:08:10.698,00:08:13.117,"-Welcome to The Dorchester, Mr. Colt. -Thank you."
00:08:13.201,00:08:15.328,You have a suite. Top floor. Wonderful view.
00:08:15.411,00:08:16.913,Really? I think you might have made a...
00:08:18.664,00:08:19.499,Thank you.
00:08:43.773,00:08:44.774,Wow!
00:08:53.574,00:08:55.159,"Well, they weren't wrong about the view."
00:09:01.290,00:09:03.000,-You need something? -Yeah. I...
00:09:03.709,00:09:06.879,I'm so sorry. I was given the key to room 1221.
00:09:07.797,00:09:09.674,This is room 1221.
00:09:10.258,00:09:11.300,My 1221.
00:09:11.759,00:09:13.177,"Oh, right, your 1221."
00:09:14.303,00:09:15.429,"Well, that makes perfect sense."
00:09:15.972,00:09:17.306,What makes perfect sense?
00:09:17.390,00:09:19.976,"Well, you see, I'd reserved a more modest room."
00:09:20.059,00:09:24.814,And now I'll go to the front desk and thank them for this dreadful error.
00:09:26.065,00:09:27.191,"Good-bye, then."
00:09:27.275,00:09:28.109,"Yes, good-bye."
00:09:28.401,00:09:29.819,And may I say good body... Luck.
00:09:30.528,00:09:31.904,Shit. I meant...
00:09:34.824,00:09:35.658,Shit!
00:09:40.580,00:09:41.414,Oh.
00:09:42.582,00:09:43.416,Lovely kitchen.
00:09:43.833,00:09:44.667,This way.
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.555,"See, now, that's much cozier."
00:09:58.598,00:10:01.058,"Yeah, I get a lot of questions about my personal life."
00:10:01.350,00:10:02.268,I usually don't answer them.
00:10:04.145,00:10:07.356,"Right. I mean, I just wanna focus on my game, you know."
00:10:07.440,00:10:13.070,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with my dad on this one, all that other stuff just gets in the way."
00:10:13.154,00:10:15.489,"But, Lizzie, you have had problems with chair umpires this year."
00:10:16.115,00:10:19.118,Some of the players think you go out of your way to disrupt a match.
00:10:21.203,00:10:27.627,"You know, maybe I go a little over the top sometimes, but, you know, maybe that's what I need to do to play my best."
00:10:28.002,00:10:30.630,And that's why I came to London. To win Wimbledon.
00:10:34.759,00:10:36.010,"Well, that's the idea, Danny."
00:10:36.093,00:10:37.136,I've got a strong feeling.
00:10:37.219,00:10:38.054,"Oh, thanks, Danny."
00:10:38.471,00:10:39.722,"Gonna knock 'em dead this year, Ivan?"
00:10:39.805,00:10:40.640,I'll do my best for you.
00:10:51.275,00:10:53.986,Afraid not. There's a chance I may get lucky tonight.
00:10:54.070,00:10:54.904,"Oh, really?"
00:10:54.987,00:10:57.198,"Intriguing Irish girl, her father owns much of Dublin."
00:10:57.281,00:10:58.282,Excellent.
00:10:59.033,00:10:59.867,She have a sister?
00:11:00.159,00:11:01.911,-Only child. -Tragic.
00:11:02.244,00:11:03.829,"I should stay and work on my serve, anyway."
00:11:04.455,00:11:06.666,"If this is my last hurrah, I wanna go out in style."
00:11:06.749,00:11:08.417,"Oh, that's the spirit, old man."
00:11:17.676,00:11:18.511,Bugger!
00:11:22.223,00:11:24.183,"Oops! Sorry, wrong court."
00:11:26.185,00:11:27.353,Forgotten me already?
00:11:27.603,00:11:29.814,"God, no, you're the lady with the lovely kitchen."
00:11:29.897,00:11:31.440,"-Uh-huh. -Lizzie Bradbury, right?"
00:11:31.816,00:11:32.650,And you're?
00:11:32.733,00:11:34.068,Peter. Peter Colt.
00:11:35.027,00:11:36.946,"Nice to meet you, Peter Peter Colt."
00:11:37.530,00:11:38.906,Five quid says you can't do it again.
00:11:39.615,00:11:40.741,Mmm-hmm.
00:11:46.497,00:11:48.457,Ten bucks says you can't hit two in a row.
00:11:48.958,00:11:49.792,You're on.
00:11:55.756,00:11:56.590,Lovely form.
00:11:56.674,00:11:57.508,Thank you.
00:12:03.013,00:12:05.015,Hmm. You're exceeding my expectations.
00:12:05.182,00:12:06.058,"Mine, too."
00:12:06.809,00:12:09.061,"Do it with a slice serve, I'll treat you to fish and chips."
00:12:09.520,00:12:11.230,"Ooh, the pressure is on."
00:12:14.150,00:12:15.025,Lovely toss.
00:12:16.068,00:12:17.319,"Fish and chips it is, then."
00:12:17.403,00:12:19.113,"Lizzie, sweetheart, what the heck are you doing?"
00:12:19.196,00:12:20.781,"Oh, just one more serve, Daddy."
00:12:20.865,00:12:23.492,You've gotta be back in the hotel in 20 minutes for an interview.
00:12:23.742,00:12:24.869,"Two seconds, okay?"
00:12:28.706,00:12:30.166,"Funny, you don't seem the daddy type."
00:12:32.918,00:12:40.926,Hit this one Too bad. You could have used the workout.
00:12:52.480,00:13:00.446,"where the players featured on Centre Court today include Andy Roddick, Serena Williams and Britain's best hope for a title, Tom Cavendish."
00:13:01.238,00:13:04.325,Other Brits in action include journeyman veteran Peter Colt.
00:13:04.408,00:13:08.078,And today marks the Wimbledon debut of American Lizzie Bradbury.
00:13:08.329,00:13:10.498,We'll see if she can live up to her lively reputation.
00:13:12.374,00:13:13.626,The chalk flew up!
00:13:13.709,00:13:14.919,There's a mark right there!
00:13:15.336,00:13:16.170,The ball was out.
00:13:16.253,00:13:17.463,Get on with it!
00:13:17.880,00:13:19.256,You know what? I'll let it go.
00:13:19.340,00:13:21.592,"'Cause you obviously can't see, and I feel sorry for you."
00:13:22.843,00:13:23.719,30-15.
00:13:27.765,00:13:28.849,"Quiet, please."
00:13:33.270,00:13:34.104,40-15.
00:13:41.946,00:13:43.697,-What time's your match? -Three o'clock.
00:13:44.240,00:13:45.991,Ajay Bhatt. You ever heard of him?
00:13:46.075,00:13:47.034,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:47.618,00:13:49.119,He's sitting over there. Look.
00:13:49.578,00:13:50.538,"Oh, my God!"
00:13:50.621,00:13:52.706,Shouldn't he be off discovering masturbation or something?
00:13:53.332,00:13:55.209,I played him in Bogotá. He's like all young men.
00:13:55.292,00:13:57.503,"Out to destroy us, to kill the father."
00:13:58.420,00:14:01.090,"Like all young men, he must first be taught a lesson of humility."
00:14:01.173,00:14:04.051,Exactly. And you taught him that lesson in Bogotá?
00:14:04.969,00:14:05.886,"Sadly, no."
00:14:06.262,00:14:07.846,"He killed the father, straight sets."
00:14:09.265,00:14:10.474,Watch out for his backhand.
00:14:14.687,00:14:16.480,with Shining Armor coming wide to challenge the leaders.
00:14:24.572,00:14:26.156,"-Ajay Bhatt. -Hold on, hold on."
00:14:26.240,00:14:27.366,Isn't he playing your brother?
00:14:28.200,00:14:29.910,You should be ashamed of yourself.
00:14:29.994,00:14:32.413,"Yeah. But curiously, I'm not."
00:14:39.837,00:14:42.298,This is the end. This is what it looks like.
00:14:42.756,00:14:46.677,"One thousand balls a day, 300 days a year, for 25 years."
00:14:46.760,00:14:48.721,Six million balls.
00:14:49.179,00:14:57.479,"And it all ends here, at 2:00 in the afternoon on Court 17 while they're over on Centre Court screaming for the latest Russian teenage beauty."
00:14:59.565,00:15:02.318,"Well, let's see if I can at least make it last a little while."
00:15:05.321,00:15:06.196,"Good luck, Mr. Colt."
00:15:07.489,00:15:08.324,Thank you.
00:15:11.619,00:15:13.454,Bhatt to serve. First set.
00:15:14.663,00:15:15.497,"Right, then."
00:15:29.762,00:15:30.721,Love-15.
00:15:36.977,00:15:39.480,Another 71 like it and you've got it in the bag.
00:15:46.570,00:15:47.863,And we have our first match point.
00:15:49.156,00:15:51.784,"I must say, he's playing with newfound confidence today, all right."
00:15:52.826,00:15:54.536,"So here we are, match point."
00:15:56.872,00:15:58.082,"Yes! Come on, get it."
00:15:58.165,00:15:59.166,A short return.
00:15:59.249,00:16:01.460,"Yes, good shot, well done! Come on!"
00:16:02.294,00:16:03.379,"Come on. Yes, that's it!"
00:16:04.755,00:16:06.298,-Peter Colt has advanced... -He's done it!
00:16:06.382,00:16:07.383,...to the Second Round.
00:16:07.466,00:16:08.550,He's through Round One!
00:16:09.218,00:16:10.219,Not interested.
00:16:12.262,00:16:13.097,What?
00:16:14.431,00:16:15.599,Not interested.
00:16:15.975,00:16:17.059,"Oh, suit yourself."
00:16:19.311,00:16:21.021,"So, you think that kid has a future?"
00:16:21.230,00:16:22.064,"Yes, I do."
00:16:22.147,00:16:27.987,"I expect one day to be the answer to the trivia question, Who beat Ajay Bhatt in his first ever Grand Slam?"
00:16:28.070,00:16:29.989,"What Wimbledon is this for you, Peter?"
00:16:30.364,00:16:32.241,"It's my 13th, actually."
00:16:33.826,00:16:39.373,"And since this may well be my last Wimbledon press conference, um, I'd like to take the opportunity..."
00:16:44.253,00:16:45.087,...tennis.
00:16:46.797,00:16:47.840,"Hey, guys."
00:16:48.799,00:16:50.509,That's my retirement from tennis.
00:16:53.554,00:16:56.640,Effective the moment this tournament ends.
00:16:59.727,00:17:04.273,"All right, tomorrow morning I want you at the rear entrance, nine o'clock sharp. We can avoid all of this. All right?"
00:17:04.898,00:17:05.899,"Excuse me. Excuse me, please."
00:17:05.983,00:17:06.942,"Come on, sweetie."
00:17:11.196,00:17:12.823,Excuse me. Excuse me.
00:17:13.699,00:17:14.575,Excuse me.
00:17:24.543,00:17:27.379,"Uh, say seven o'clock, room 1221."
00:17:27.463,00:17:28.589,That's my 1221.
00:17:28.672,00:17:29.506,"Oh, bollocks!"
00:17:53.197,00:17:59.745,"Once mistaken for a shooting star, ...from two US servicemen on patrol in the South Pacific."
00:17:59.995,00:18:05.709,It's the first time in 67 years it's appeared and will be visible to the naked eye for the next two weeks.
00:18:07.419,00:18:08.253,Hi.
00:18:09.129,00:18:09.963,Hi.
00:18:12.174,00:18:13.592,"Two fish and chips, as promised."
00:18:13.675,00:18:15.010,-Um... -What?
00:18:15.302,00:18:18.430,"-Let me just take this. -Oh, jeez. How embarrassing."
00:18:21.683,00:18:22.518,Are you hungry?
00:18:22.601,00:18:23.435,Um...
00:18:23.936,00:18:24.895,Not quite.
00:18:26.772,00:18:28.232,I've got a question for you.
00:18:28.398,00:18:29.233,Right.
00:18:29.608,00:18:32.486,Where do you come down on the whole fooling around before a match issue?
00:18:34.738,00:18:36.532,"Well, that's a very intriguing question."
00:18:36.615,00:18:40.619,Because I think a little fooling around can be really good for your game.
00:18:41.036,00:18:42.663,You know? Help you relax.
00:18:42.996,00:18:46.875,"Um, I'm not sure I've done enough research to have a definitive opinion."
00:18:47.835,00:18:48.794,That's very sad.
00:18:49.461,00:18:50.879,"Yes, it is, isn't it? It is..."
00:18:51.797,00:18:52.631,It's very sad.
00:18:53.590,00:18:58.387,"Don't get me wrong, I'm very interested in doing the necessary research."
00:19:01.098,00:19:01.932,Are you?
00:19:02.474,00:19:03.433,I'm interested.
00:19:10.315,00:19:14.403,"Peter, no one can know about this, okay?"
00:19:18.490,00:19:19.700,-Seriously. -Okay.
00:19:19.783,00:19:21.034,Especially my dad.
00:19:21.368,00:19:24.538,"He's convinced if there's a guy around, my first serve gets mushy."
00:19:24.955,00:19:26.957,"Well, you can't win Wimbledon with a mushy serve."
00:19:27.040,00:19:27.875,No.
00:19:28.333,00:19:30.961,"So, we'll keep it light, okay?"
00:19:31.670,00:19:36.341,"Absolutely fine with me. We'll just keep it, you know, fun and -and relaxed. -Relaxed."
00:19:37.801,00:19:38.635,Good.
00:19:44.266,00:19:45.100,Peter?
00:19:46.393,00:19:47.936,Excellent. More research.
00:19:52.733,00:19:58.197,"The truth is that Dragomir seems to have completely seized control on this court, known as the Graveyard of Champions."
00:19:59.823,00:20:03.452,"For some reason, Peter Colt's game this afternoon has been less than inspired."
00:20:07.831,00:20:11.293,"Stay up all night doing research, you're bound to be exhausted."
00:20:27.226,00:20:29.228,Dragomir leads five games to four in the fourth set...
00:20:29.311,00:20:30.354,"Come on, Peter."
00:20:30.437,00:20:31.396,...and by two sets to one.
00:20:31.480,00:20:32.773,"Hello, do you mind?"
00:20:34.816,00:20:36.193,"Oh, bugger!"
00:20:36.985,00:20:38.528,He was doing so well.
00:20:38.612,00:20:40.280,"I wouldn't write him off just yet, Pauline."
00:20:40.656,00:20:45.786,"Some young men, I find, have a stamina that's really quite deceptive."
00:20:51.833,00:20:53.585,At least you got three games off.
00:20:53.669,00:20:54.753,Three games?
00:20:55.337,00:20:56.797,Three lousy games.
00:20:56.880,00:21:00.092,Last match of your career and you got three games?
00:21:06.431,00:21:08.558,"Well, at least there's no one here to see you lose."
00:21:12.646,00:21:13.689,"Oh, great!"
00:21:44.511,00:21:45.804,that we'd be in a fifth set?
00:21:46.179,00:21:53.895,"But here, Peter Colt, who hasn't beaten a top-ten player in the past two years, remember, is at 5-4, three points from winning the match."
00:22:07.659,00:22:08.827,You were with me last match.
00:22:09.161,00:22:10.996,"Yes, sir. Brilliant play, sir."
00:22:12.122,00:22:13.582,Do you think I could trouble you?
00:22:13.665,00:22:14.499,Sorry.
00:22:33.143,00:22:33.977,40-love.
00:22:54.623,00:22:55.457,Out!
00:23:00.337,00:23:03.673,has defeated the French Open Champion to advance to the Third Round.
00:23:17.896,00:23:19.272,Thought I'd done my last one of these.
00:23:26.613,00:23:28.031,you've defeated in three years?
00:23:28.406,00:23:31.451,"Yes, 2 months and 14 days, but who's really counting?"
00:23:32.911,00:23:34.996,What do you think of your next opponent?
00:23:35.664,00:23:38.959,"Truthfully, in all the excitement, I haven't even checked to see who it is."
00:23:44.923,00:23:46.716,An intriguing existential dilemma.
00:23:50.345,00:23:51.513,Is your elbow playing you up?
00:23:52.514,00:23:54.724,"Well, if I admit to that, you may use it to your advantage."
00:23:55.350,00:23:56.393,"Wow, that's terrible."
00:23:56.476,00:23:58.270,Is that what our friendship's come to?
00:24:01.773,00:24:03.483,"Oh, well, the truth is most everything aches."
00:24:03.567,00:24:04.609,"What doesn't, I can't feel at all."
00:24:04.693,00:24:05.527,Tell me about it.
00:24:05.819,00:24:07.445,"Yeah, hello? Hello?"
00:24:07.779,00:24:10.198,We should still practise together. We must stick to the routine.
00:24:10.282,00:24:14.452,"Yeah. You know, the hotel offered me a better room and I told them, you know, I'm on a roll at the moment, I'm not changing a thing."
00:24:14.536,00:24:16.204,At such moments our superstitions are all we have.
00:24:16.288,00:24:17.122,Exactly.
00:24:17.747,00:24:20.458,"Even when I'm taking a shit, I must do it exactly the same."
00:24:21.543,00:24:23.837,I'd never thought of that. That's genius!
00:24:23.920,00:24:26.131,"You think of everything important, you do it the same."
00:24:26.673,00:24:27.632,"-Oh, wait a minute. -Yeah."
00:24:27.716,00:24:29.259,"Oh, that's okay, put me through."
00:24:29.926,00:24:31.469,"Lizzie, Lizzie, don't say a word."
00:24:31.553,00:24:33.346,I was thinking a repeat of the other night.
00:24:33.430,00:24:35.682,"Like fish and chips, early to bed."
00:24:37.475,00:24:38.768,Mr. Bradbury! Hello.
00:24:40.395,00:24:41.313,Mr. Bradbury?
00:24:43.440,00:24:44.274,Damn!
00:24:44.858,00:24:45.692,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:24:58.872,00:24:59.706,Billi!
00:25:01.374,00:25:04.211,"Oh, you are the Dragomir slayer."
00:25:04.294,00:25:06.504,How are you? You look a million lira.
00:25:06.963,00:25:08.465,"Thank you, thank you. I try."
00:25:08.548,00:25:09.758,"Do you know my partner, Sophia?"
00:25:09.841,00:25:11.134,-No. Hi. -Nice to meet you.
00:25:12.135,00:25:15.263,I'm looking for Lizzie Bradbury. Have you seen her?
00:25:15.347,00:25:17.807,No. You should ask Jake Hammond.
00:25:18.391,00:25:19.434,"Oh, really, why?"
00:25:20.060,00:25:21.478,"Well, why do you think?"
00:25:23.063,00:25:24.064,"Oh, right."
00:25:25.065,00:25:26.274,"Well, I better get a move on."
00:25:26.358,00:25:27.192,Ciao.
00:25:29.194,00:25:30.654,-Good luck tomorrow. -Thank you.
00:25:35.158,00:25:36.451,Wouldn't happen to be my daughter?
00:25:37.494,00:25:38.328,"Yes, it would."
00:25:40.247,00:25:41.248,"It's Colt, right?"
00:25:41.706,00:25:43.083,"Yes, but please call me Peter."
00:25:43.667,00:25:47.671,Lizzie is on a roll right now and I don't want her to have any distractions.
00:25:48.171,00:25:49.464,Right. Of course.
00:25:51.716,00:25:53.927,"Sorry, just to clarify, do you see me as a distraction?"
00:25:55.011,00:25:56.805,That's exactly how I see you.
00:25:58.265,00:25:59.808,So stop looking for her.
00:26:00.433,00:26:02.394,"Stop calling her, stop coming around."
00:26:02.477,00:26:06.314,Stop every damn thing that involves my daughter.
00:26:07.274,00:26:08.108,Is that clear?
00:26:27.419,00:26:29.170,the English will have evolved webbed feet.
00:26:29.754,00:26:33.341,"Yes, just about the same time the first German evolves a sense of humor."
00:26:33.425,00:26:35.176,"No, no, no. That's not fair."
00:26:35.260,00:26:36.678,Many times I make you laugh.
00:26:37.387,00:26:39.264,"No, I'm laughing at you, not with you."
00:26:43.768,00:26:46.062,"-Oh, you know what, I think I'll-- -I think you will, too."
00:26:46.146,00:26:47.814,"-See, now that was quite funny. -Yeah, I know."
00:26:49.107,00:26:52.527,"Hey, get some rest tonight. I don't wanna win too easily."
00:26:52.736,00:26:54.446,"What with you and that, what is it, bad knee?"
00:26:59.492,00:27:01.036,I have a little confession to make.
00:27:01.369,00:27:02.203,"Oh, God."
00:27:04.372,00:27:06.666,"When you, uh, walked into my room the other day?"
00:27:06.750,00:27:09.002,-Mmm-hmm. -I knew exactly who you were.
00:27:09.586,00:27:11.004,-You did? -Mmm-hmm.
00:27:11.713,00:27:14.382,I saw you play Tommy Haas at the Lipton last year.
00:27:14.841,00:27:15.884,"Oh, shit."
00:27:18.386,00:27:20.972,You were ahead but then you totally fell apart. Remember?
00:27:21.056,00:27:24.476,"Yeah. As I recall, the ball girl couldn't get out of the way of my serve."
00:27:25.560,00:27:27.771,You gallantly carried her off the court.
00:27:27.896,00:27:29.856,I thought you were such a...
00:27:32.442,00:27:35.153,To lose like that when you were playing so beautifully.
00:27:37.072,00:27:38.615,But I couldn't get it out of my head.
00:27:39.157,00:27:40.658,I kept hoping I'd run into you.
00:27:40.950,00:27:43.411,Until finally you walked into my hotel room.
00:27:44.371,00:27:45.789,"Like a knight in shining armor, perhaps?"
00:27:47.457,00:27:48.291,No.
00:27:49.876,00:27:51.419,Trouble is I'm the one who needs saving.
00:27:52.712,00:27:56.383,"Yesterday I was losing, and then I saw you watching."
00:28:05.809,00:28:07.977,Perhaps my first serve is getting a little mushy.
00:28:33.920,00:28:35.213,"Oh! Hey, look."
00:28:35.880,00:28:37.257,There it is. The comet.
00:28:37.340,00:28:38.883,"See, with the little tail behind it?"
00:28:41.219,00:28:42.512,"Hardly anything, is it?"
00:28:43.054,00:28:44.055,Barely moving.
00:28:46.015,00:28:47.267,We have to wish on it.
00:28:51.980,00:28:53.356,Did you wish on your next match?
00:28:54.733,00:28:56.025,Wouldn't work if I told you.
00:28:57.777,00:28:58.903,Who do you play?
00:28:59.487,00:29:01.364,"Good friend of mine, actually, Dieter Prohl."
00:29:01.573,00:29:02.532,A friend?
00:29:03.450,00:29:04.951,Then you should know how to beat him.
00:29:06.286,00:29:07.370,What are his weaknesses?
00:29:07.454,00:29:10.790,"Um, sausages, Wagner, men in leather shorts."
00:29:10.874,00:29:11.750,In his game.
00:29:12.208,00:29:14.586,That's why I gave up having girlfriends in tennis.
00:29:14.669,00:29:16.755,You have to dig extra deep to kill your friends.
00:29:16.838,00:29:17.881,Now I have to kill him?
00:29:19.799,00:29:21.426,-And I don't envy you. -Why is that?
00:29:22.010,00:29:25.555,"You practice together, you travel together, you practically live together."
00:29:26.139,00:29:30.143,"I mean, do you really have what it takes to close out a friend in the Third Round of Wimbledon?"
00:29:31.019,00:29:32.687,Because that is killing him.
00:29:33.813,00:29:35.190,It's a bullet to the heart.
00:29:37.108,00:29:38.902,That's what's tough about this game.
00:29:38.985,00:29:40.653,There's a winner and there's a loser.
00:29:41.571,00:29:44.324,"And tomorrow, one of you is going to be a loser."
00:29:56.669,00:29:57.670,Bloody pedals!
00:30:03.343,00:30:04.177,"Hello, Vij."
00:30:05.303,00:30:07.472,What... Where the hell are the men's matches?
00:30:07.555,00:30:10.099,"Roddick lost to Jake Hammond. Four sets, mate."
00:30:10.183,00:30:12.101,"Shit, what about Peter and Prohl?"
00:30:12.727,00:30:14.020,-You didn't hear? -No.
00:30:14.229,00:30:15.146,"Straight sets, man."
00:30:15.230,00:30:17.273,"Peter decimated him, tore him to pieces, mate."
00:30:17.357,00:30:18.191,Shit!
00:30:18.274,00:30:19.692,What? You bet against him again?
00:30:19.776,00:30:22.070,Yeah. That bastard usually comes through for me.
00:30:22.153,00:30:23.738,He's been on such a good losing streak.
00:30:24.280,00:30:26.533,"Here, are you Peter Colt's brother?"
00:30:26.950,00:30:27.784,Possibly.
00:30:28.701,00:30:31.287,"I've, uh, seen you in here, watching the matches."
00:30:31.371,00:30:32.205,Yeah.
00:30:33.289,00:30:34.833,You could say tennis is my life.
00:30:35.166,00:30:36.543,My passion is chat rooms.
00:30:40.672,00:30:41.631,Broadband.
00:30:41.714,00:30:42.757,Of course.
00:30:52.141,00:30:55.103,"Well, you may have humiliated the kraut, but you're not done with him."
00:30:56.187,00:30:58.398,We change your routine not one iota.
00:30:59.357,00:31:01.025,I'm still your practice partner.
00:31:02.235,00:31:03.236,"Thanks, mate."
00:31:05.613,00:31:08.074,"Anyway, you know it was a hell of a lot closer than the score."
00:31:09.284,00:31:11.619,"A net cord here or there, it would've been a different story."
00:31:11.703,00:31:12.620,Bullshit.
00:31:12.704,00:31:14.247,You annihilated me. You...
00:31:15.248,00:31:17.166,"You hit from the soul, the heart."
00:31:18.251,00:31:19.502,Something's happened to you.
00:31:20.211,00:31:21.421,"Something else, something..."
00:31:23.172,00:31:26.509,The girl in the taxi. The waving hand. That's...
00:31:28.261,00:31:30.305,"That's where the fire comes from, admit it."
00:31:31.222,00:31:32.223,"Dieter, listen."
00:31:34.100,00:31:42.191,"Do you think that in the middle of a Championship, when for the first time in years I'm actually winning, I'd be dumb enough to get involved with a woman?"
00:31:43.443,00:31:44.444,Absolutely.
00:32:01.878,00:32:03.338,"Well, aren't I popular?"
00:32:05.465,00:32:09.093,"Peter, Ian Frazier here, from the club. Well done!"
00:32:09.218,00:32:11.220,Take as long as you need before you start with us.
00:32:11.304,00:32:15.516,"Oh, and the, uh, ladies send their regards."
00:32:22.148,00:32:24.651,I have a free day tomorrow. I'll call you later.
00:32:29.739,00:32:30.573,It's your mother.
00:32:32.951,00:32:34.744,What did I always say about you?
00:32:35.328,00:32:36.829,"I don't know. Remind me, Ron."
00:32:40.291,00:32:43.002,And cucumber. They forgot to put the sandwich in my sandwich.
00:32:44.379,00:32:45.630,"What are you doing here, Ron?"
00:32:45.713,00:32:47.090,"You're not still my agent, are you?"
00:32:47.173,00:32:48.132,What are you talking about?
00:32:48.591,00:32:49.425,What am I talking about?
00:32:49.509,00:32:54.222,"Okay. Well, I called you about a year ago, and I'm still waiting for you to return my call."
00:32:54.305,00:32:57.392,"Yeah, I'm into emails now, I don't do the phone thing anymore."
00:32:57.850,00:32:58.685,Ron...
00:32:59.727,00:33:00.561,that's a lie.
00:33:02.647,00:33:03.523,"Yeah, it's a lie."
00:33:03.606,00:33:05.233,You want me to be completely honest with you?
00:33:05.733,00:33:07.276,Agents are not miracle workers.
00:33:07.485,00:33:09.612,We can't sell a product that doesn't exist.
00:33:09.696,00:33:12.365,"But here you are, existing again, so I'm back selling again."
00:33:12.865,00:33:14.784,"You know what, Ron? I genuinely despise you."
00:33:15.118,00:33:16.202,"And you know what, Peter?"
00:33:16.619,00:33:18.079,I really don't take it personally.
00:33:18.538,00:33:20.248,Because this could all be over by Monday.
00:33:20.331,00:33:23.084,"Cavendish is a serve-and-volley guy, and you've always played shit against them."
00:33:23.167,00:33:25.545,So I'd like to capitalize now if that's not a problem with you.
00:33:25.878,00:33:31.843,"I don't want you to go down in history as that English guy who beat his best friend, the German guy, only to get beat by the other English guy."
00:33:32.385,00:33:34.178,I'd like to put some money in your pocket.
00:33:34.262,00:33:35.346,You got a problem with that?
00:33:35.722,00:33:37.015,You'd have to cut your commission.
00:33:38.057,00:33:40.685,"Okay, look. Unfortunately that's a no-go area."
00:33:40.768,00:33:41.728,Everybody pays 10%.
00:33:41.811,00:33:44.188,"Say 5%, or the next offer's 4."
00:33:45.815,00:33:47.734,"You know, success has really changed you."
00:33:49.277,00:33:51.195,"And I'm loving it. Screw it, you got a deal."
00:33:51.696,00:33:53.906,"Besides, I have a funny feeling that Cavendish is going down."
00:33:53.990,00:33:55.616,-Tea? -Yes. I'd love some.
00:33:55.908,00:33:57.160,"Now, let's get down to business."
00:33:57.243,00:34:04.208,"Slazenger is having a cocktail party this evening and everybody's dying to meet you for the very first time, all over again."
00:34:14.844,00:34:15.928,I'll call you back.
00:34:16.012,00:34:17.805,-Ring me tomorrow. -That's fine. Tomorrow's fine.
00:34:18.181,00:34:19.557,-Lizzie. -Ronnie.
00:34:19.640,00:34:21.017,-There she is. -How they hanging?
00:34:21.642,00:34:22.852,-Fine. And yours? -Fine.
00:34:22.935,00:34:24.479,Who's your new friend? Aren't you going to introduce me?
00:34:24.562,00:34:25.980,"-You haven't met yet? -Hi, I'm Lizzie."
00:34:26.064,00:34:27.398,Peter. Peter Colt.
00:34:27.482,00:34:29.609,-The Peter Peter Colt? -The one and only.
00:34:29.692,00:34:30.985,"Oh, I've heard a lot about you."
00:34:31.069,00:34:32.195,"Oh, really? Nothing good, I hope."
00:34:32.278,00:34:34.405,That you're a man who's not afraid to come to the net.
00:34:34.489,00:34:37.450,"Yeah, and I hear that this is your first Wimbledon and you're gonna go all the way."
00:34:37.533,00:34:38.618,Every chance I get.
00:34:38.701,00:34:40.870,"Well, well, well. If this works out, do I get the, uh..."
00:34:40.953,00:34:42.622,You can have 10% of our kids.
00:34:42.705,00:34:43.915,"Oh, your kids, that's..."
00:34:46.125,00:34:46.959,You all right?
00:34:47.418,00:34:49.128,-You look beautiful. -Thank you.
00:34:49.504,00:34:51.214,You come along and play matchmaker? For Christ's sake!
00:34:51.297,00:34:52.423,"Oh, did I do that? I'm sorry."
00:34:52.507,00:34:54.175,"I just got excited by the math, that's all."
00:34:54.258,00:34:59.180,"Let's just have a drink, we could talk over this whole Nike thing and you'll still have her home before she turns into a pumpkin."
00:35:01.557,00:35:05.144,One day none of this will be ours.
00:35:06.854,00:35:09.315,"Oh, no, asshole incoming, four o'clock."
00:35:10.149,00:35:11.234,"Lizzie, what's the deal?"
00:35:11.317,00:35:13.069,"I've left you, like, half a dozen messages."
00:35:13.152,00:35:14.779,"Oh, really? How about that?"
00:35:16.072,00:35:16.906,Hi.
00:35:17.615,00:35:18.658,Do you know Peter Colt?
00:35:18.866,00:35:19.826,Yeah. We did meet once.
00:35:19.909,00:35:21.119,"First Round, San Jose, last year."
00:35:21.661,00:35:23.579,Exactly. A memorable match.
00:35:23.663,00:35:26.165,"Yeah. Which I, like, won."
00:35:27.834,00:35:29.752,Peter's in the Quarters. Did you hear?
00:35:30.002,00:35:30.837,Wait a second.
00:35:32.088,00:35:33.339,Are you screwing him?
00:35:34.674,00:35:36.342,"-You know what-- -You are, aren't you?"
00:35:37.093,00:35:37.927,I don't believe it.
00:35:38.010,00:35:41.973,"Listen, my friend, we don't want-- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you, grandpa, ranked, like, 120?"
00:35:43.057,00:35:49.772,"I thought all those things they said about you were just rumors, but you really are a cheap little-- Jesus, that really hurts."
00:35:49.856,00:35:51.274,But you did it so well.
00:35:53.025,00:35:53.860,"Good night, Jake."
00:35:53.943,00:35:55.194,"Hey, yes. Don't get up."
00:35:57.071,00:35:59.699,That's the first time I've ever hit anybody in my whole life.
00:36:10.459,00:36:11.294,Lizzie?
00:36:11.586,00:36:12.420,Lizzie!
00:36:13.796,00:36:14.755,"Other side, other..."
00:36:22.680,00:36:25.308,I've never had anyone fight for my honor before.
00:36:26.058,00:36:27.226,I kind of like it.
00:37:01.761,00:37:08.184,"The drugs, the sex, My parents live here, and I still keep a flat."
00:37:08.684,00:37:10.269,"Oh, so we can stay there tonight."
00:37:10.937,00:37:12.188,"Yeah, but what about your dad?"
00:37:12.271,00:37:14.106,"Ah, let him find his own place."
00:37:17.318,00:37:19.028,Parents are such a responsibility.
00:37:19.111,00:37:20.363,I know. They're worse than children.
00:37:20.446,00:37:21.447,"Oh, definitely."
00:37:22.615,00:37:24.825,My parents got divorced when I was 13.
00:37:25.785,00:37:28.246,"My mom was always on the road, trying to be a singer."
00:37:28.454,00:37:29.455,What went wrong?
00:37:32.917,00:37:34.126,So mainly my dad brought me up.
00:37:34.835,00:37:35.836,Mine are still together.
00:37:36.754,00:37:39.632,"Which proves that love's not just blind, it's bloody stupid."
00:37:41.008,00:37:41.968,It's sad.
00:37:42.718,00:37:46.013,Everything they used to love in each other now seems to drive them crazy.
00:37:48.391,00:37:50.685,I can't imagine ever wanting to get married.
00:37:52.311,00:37:53.145,No.
00:37:53.479,00:37:54.313,No.
00:37:54.397,00:37:56.315,"I mean, that's why we love the tour, isn't it?"
00:37:57.566,00:38:01.112,"There's always another country, another airport."
00:38:01.696,00:38:02.530,Another girl.
00:38:02.613,00:38:03.447,"That's right, Lesley."
00:38:03.823,00:38:05.116,Lizzie. I meant Lizzie.
00:38:06.575,00:38:07.410,Who's Lesley?
00:38:14.542,00:38:19.338,"As you can see, we've had to fire the builders due to creative differences."
00:38:19.422,00:38:22.883,"And truthfully, Peter's had a little bit of a liquidity problem."
00:38:22.967,00:38:24.760,"Oh, my nan liked a drink."
00:38:24.844,00:38:26.137,-Sherry. -Right.
00:38:26.220,00:38:27.305,-Piccy? -Just a bitty.
00:38:29.307,00:38:30.266,"Carl, what are you doing?"
00:38:30.349,00:38:32.018,"Ah, Pete, hi. Um..."
00:38:32.643,00:38:33.769,Wasn't expecting to see you.
00:38:33.853,00:38:35.521,"And, shit, that's Lizzie Bradbury."
00:38:38.107,00:38:39.984,-Digital. -Look what I found.
00:38:40.067,00:38:41.569,"-Oh, hello. -Give me that!"
00:38:41.861,00:38:43.821,-Who are you? -I only got four pizzas.
00:38:44.447,00:38:45.406,"Oh, for God's sake!"
00:38:45.489,00:38:47.074,"Right, that's it. Get out."
00:38:47.366,00:38:49.035,"-Come on! -You, too, sunshine."
00:38:49.118,00:38:50.536,-Bugger! I had it on landscape! -Move it.
00:38:50.619,00:38:51.620,Stop it. It's not funny.
00:38:53.456,00:38:54.915,"-Change of venue, girls. -Children, out."
00:38:54.999,00:38:56.250,Your mum's or mine?
00:38:57.001,00:38:57.835,Big fan.
00:38:58.502,00:38:59.545,"Carl, leave."
00:39:01.047,00:39:02.089,I am so sorry.
00:39:02.923,00:39:04.258,Might wanna change the sheets.
00:39:55.351,00:39:56.727,"Hi, Daddy, it's me."
00:39:57.686,00:40:03.734,"I know you're probably going nuts and wanna kill me, but everything's cool, really."
00:40:05.361,00:40:06.195,Um...
00:40:06.612,00:40:10.658,It's hard to explain but I really needed to do this.
00:40:11.158,00:40:11.992,and...
00:40:12.701,00:40:15.162,I gotta go. I'll see you at practice in the morning.
00:40:16.997,00:40:17.998,Everything all right?
00:40:18.290,00:40:19.333,Everything's great.
00:40:21.252,00:40:22.545,Wanna go have a workout?
00:40:23.087,00:40:24.380,I thought we just had one.
00:40:27.633,00:40:29.176,I usually do ten miles.
00:40:30.052,00:40:31.720,So why are you running behind me?
00:40:31.971,00:40:33.180,Just enjoying the view.
00:41:12.011,00:41:13.220,"Hey, look at that."
00:41:39.330,00:41:41.332,This is where my dad taught me to play tennis.
00:41:44.418,00:41:46.170,"Look at it now, it's a shame."
00:41:47.171,00:41:48.005,Yeah.
00:42:02.686,00:42:03.521,Ace!
00:42:05.272,00:42:06.774,"Come on, make a little effort."
00:42:15.699,00:42:16.534,Ace!
00:42:19.328,00:42:20.412,What's the matter with you?
00:42:21.330,00:42:22.498,Are you scared of a girl?
00:42:24.500,00:42:25.626,There's something I haven't told you.
00:42:27.169,00:42:28.003,What?
00:42:30.089,00:42:31.549,This is my last tournament.
00:42:33.133,00:42:34.134,No matter what happens.
00:42:35.553,00:42:37.096,But you're doing so great.
00:42:39.014,00:42:40.558,"Hey, you just have to..."
00:42:41.058,00:42:41.892,Keep winning.
00:42:42.101,00:42:42.935,Right.
00:42:43.852,00:42:44.895,So keep winning.
00:42:55.364,00:42:57.825,with a somewhat demure cross-court forehand.
00:43:00.119,00:43:02.997,Ah! Colt makes a smashing return.
00:43:03.372,00:43:07.876,"With unladylike effort, Bradbury strains to get to the ball."
00:43:08.502,00:43:10.838,"Oh, it's an extremely high lob."
00:43:11.213,00:43:16.969,"Will he maintain his gentlemanly composure or will he, dare I say, win the point?"
00:43:18.470,00:43:20.180,"Hold on, what's happened to the ball?"
00:43:22.349,00:43:23.183,Look.
00:44:03.557,00:44:04.516,"Gotta go, bye."
00:44:05.184,00:44:06.727,Hundred quid on Cavendish in the Quarters.
00:44:06.810,00:44:07.936,Hold your horses.
00:44:08.520,00:44:10.648,"So, still betting against your brother, are you?"
00:44:10.898,00:44:12.191,It's tactical.
00:44:12.274,00:44:14.610,"If he loses, I get rich, and if he wins, I get laid."
00:44:14.693,00:44:16.487,"Where the heck did you get 100 quid, anyway?"
00:44:17.905,00:44:18.822,Photo-journalism.
00:44:29.708,00:44:34.004,I trust you slept well after your night of debauchery with the young master.
00:44:36.256,00:44:38.050,"-Good, so did I. -Oh, my God!"
00:44:38.509,00:44:40.636,No wonder the English never win Wimbledon.
00:44:43.430,00:44:46.475,"I'd love to see an English guy in the Finals, but give me a break."
00:44:46.558,00:44:48.852,Peter Colt is the luckiest man in tennis.
00:44:55.025,00:44:57.444,"God, it's incredible how much that actor looks like your dad."
00:44:59.405,00:45:00.447,"Oh, shit."
00:45:00.989,00:45:02.783,Incredible how much that building...
00:45:10.290,00:45:12.209,when the newspaper published this candid photo of Peter Colt...
00:45:12.292,00:45:14.253,"Oh, Carl, you bastard!"
00:45:22.052,00:45:23.220,"Oh, hello, Mr. Bradbury."
00:45:23.554,00:45:24.430,Where's my daughter?
00:45:24.972,00:45:27.182,"Gone, sadly. Sadly, gone."
00:45:27.266,00:45:28.851,She had to go and work on that first serve.
00:45:28.934,00:45:31.353,I expect she meant to meet you at the practice courts.
00:45:31.437,00:45:32.312,You bullshitting me?
00:45:32.396,00:45:34.898,Absolutely not. I'd never bullshit you. I wouldn't dream of it.
00:45:36.233,00:45:37.317,"So, how was your trip down?"
00:45:37.401,00:45:40.070,"Because, you know, the traffic can be murder getting out of London."
00:45:40.154,00:45:40.988,We left early.
00:45:41.071,00:45:42.448,"Well, the early bird does catch the..."
00:45:45.993,00:45:48.287,Maybe something stronger. A shot of whiskey?
00:45:50.706,00:45:51.665,"It's Peter, right?"
00:45:51.999,00:45:52.833,Yeah.
00:45:53.208,00:45:55.752,"Look, Peter, I got nothing against you personally."
00:45:55.836,00:45:57.421,"You seem like a nice guy, and, uh..."
00:45:57.504,00:45:58.338,"Oh, good."
00:45:59.047,00:45:59.882,I'm not an idiot.
00:45:59.965,00:46:04.261,I know that Lizzie likes to have her fun and it keeps her relaxed.
00:46:04.344,00:46:06.763,And if you were just another easy...
00:46:07.973,00:46:10.434,"You know, well, that would be one thing, but you're not, are you?"
00:46:11.018,00:46:12.769,"As a matter of fact, I was incredibly easy."
00:46:12.853,00:46:14.897,No. This time it's different. She's...
00:46:16.106,00:46:17.024,falling for you.
00:46:17.399,00:46:18.358,"Oh, I see."
00:46:18.442,00:46:20.194,Which is a total disaster.
00:46:20.277,00:46:22.029,"Well, why? She's hardly lost a set."
00:46:22.488,00:46:25.449,"Look, her footwork is off, her serve is a mess."
00:46:25.532,00:46:27.493,She's gotta get her head back in the game.
00:46:27.576,00:46:30.037,She's gotta remember what it is that she wants.
00:46:30.913,00:46:32.206,And what do you think that is?
00:46:32.289,00:46:34.958,What we've been working towards all these years.
00:46:35.042,00:46:38.045,What she's always wanted more than anything.
00:46:39.004,00:46:40.172,I still want it.
00:46:40.672,00:46:41.507,"Oh, hi."
00:46:42.633,00:46:44.009,I want to win Wimbledon.
00:46:47.513,00:46:48.430,I'm sorry.
00:46:49.473,00:46:50.724,"That's all right, sweetheart."
00:46:52.017,00:46:53.852,"Well, we better get going. Got a lot of work to do."
00:46:54.895,00:46:55.729,Are you gonna go?
00:46:55.812,00:46:58.649,Yeah. He's right. I'm sorry.
00:47:03.737,00:47:04.571,Lizzie?
00:47:04.988,00:47:05.822,Lizzie!
00:47:06.865,00:47:08.242,"Lizzie, this is ridiculous."
00:47:08.325,00:47:10.744,"You're a grown woman, and you should be making your own decisions."
00:47:10.827,00:47:13.580,This is my decision. We can be together after the tournament.
00:47:13.664,00:47:15.415,After the tournament? What does that mean?
00:47:15.499,00:47:17.793,You can't just switch me on and off like a bloody light bulb.
00:47:17.876,00:47:19.044,I'll call you at the hotel.
00:47:20.837,00:47:21.672,What?
00:47:21.755,00:47:24.925,"I'm sorry, kid, but if you're together, she can't play."
00:47:33.392,00:47:37.187,but Tom Cavendish is clearly in control of the crowd and the match today.
00:47:37.563,00:47:44.945,"He's up a break in the first set, and Peter Colt, with the expectations of an entire nation upon him, seems to be withering under the pressure."
00:48:01.920,00:48:03.088,Touch. 40-love.
00:48:15.809,00:48:16.935,"Well, talk to Sergei."
00:48:17.686,00:48:19.730,"If she hits short, you come in."
00:48:19.813,00:48:20.981,"Daddy, stop bugging me."
00:48:21.064,00:48:22.733,-She'll never pass you. -I'm focused.
00:48:23.358,00:48:24.526,I know the game plan.
00:48:28.697,00:48:30.824,He's out of my head now. It's over.
00:48:31.283,00:48:32.659,Stop freaking out on me.
00:48:37.873,00:48:39.916,You can see how he landed right on it.
00:48:40.000,00:48:41.084,This is ugly.
00:48:48.133,00:48:49.092,Think you can go on?
00:49:03.732,00:49:05.108,Listen to that crowd.
00:49:05.192,00:49:06.818,They worship the kid here.
00:49:07.444,00:49:11.031,"The question is, will Colt be able to take advantage of Tom Cavendish?"
00:49:11.448,00:49:13.408,He's never shown much of a killer instinct.
00:49:24.503,00:49:26.922,"Look at that smile. Watch out, Tom Cavendish."
00:49:29.633,00:49:32.135,Can we take another route? Our match is at three o'clock.
00:49:41.186,00:49:42.396,"What's the score, sweetheart?"
00:49:42.479,00:49:43.397,It's match point.
00:49:52.447,00:49:54.116,-Peter Colt has done it again. -Yes!
00:49:54.199,00:49:57.619,"Another up set, another seeded player goes down."
00:49:57.703,00:50:03.250,And Colt will now take on fifth seed Pierre Maroux in the Semifinals on Friday.
00:50:04.584,00:50:06.086,"Congratulations, my friend."
00:50:06.336,00:50:08.255,"Thank you, but I think my countrymen hate me."
00:50:08.338,00:50:10.757,-What? -I've just destroyed their best hopes of winning a Championship.
00:50:10.841,00:50:12.551,"Oh, ridiculous! Everyone loves a winner."
00:50:12.634,00:50:13.760,Everybody but the British.
00:50:17.973,00:50:18.807,Thank you.
00:50:18.890,00:50:21.560,"See, I was right. Everything's good, everybody loves you."
00:50:21.935,00:50:22.936,Almost everybody.
00:50:44.791,00:50:46.251,"No embarrassment, no fear."
00:50:46.543,00:50:48.920,"She makes a decision, she goes for it, all pistons firing."
00:50:49.004,00:50:52.966,"It's a turn-on for the rest of us 'cause most of the time, let's face it, we're all scared shitless."
00:50:53.258,00:50:54.176,"Even you, Ron?"
00:50:54.634,00:50:56.219,"Me, I hate making a decision."
00:50:56.970,00:50:57.804,"Like, right now?"
00:50:58.638,00:50:59.890,"I'm very, very afraid."
00:51:00.599,00:51:04.060,"If you don't see that girl again, it's gonna mess with your head, it'll screw up your confidence."
00:51:04.144,00:51:05.353,"On the other hand, I'm terrified."
00:51:05.437,00:51:09.608,"I'm petrified that if I tell you where that girl is camped out, her father's gonna fire my ass."
00:51:09.900,00:51:11.359,"Where's the girl camped out, Ron?"
00:51:12.444,00:51:15.197,"32 Kensington Place, first-floor apartment."
00:51:17.532,00:51:18.492,I made a decision.
00:51:20.410,00:51:23.371,"Miss Bradbury leads four games to one, final set."
00:51:23.455,00:51:24.289,"Me, too."
00:51:40.847,00:51:42.974,"Oh! Shh! No, no. Hi."
00:51:45.227,00:51:51.691,"Now, listen, it's not what you think, so don't start-- I'll jump. I'll jump."
00:51:52.108,00:51:53.819,I will. You want that on your conscience?
00:51:55.237,00:51:56.071,Thank you.
00:52:03.578,00:52:04.496,"Lizzie, it's me."
00:52:06.540,00:52:07.541,Shit!
00:52:17.217,00:52:18.051,Hey!
00:52:19.511,00:52:20.345,Shut up!
00:52:22.055,00:52:23.223,Noisy little shit.
00:52:25.809,00:52:26.643,Ow!
00:52:30.146,00:52:31.189,That hurt.
00:52:33.900,00:52:34.734,"Oh, shit!"
00:52:36.486,00:52:37.320,Bugger!
00:52:38.154,00:52:38.989,Peter!
00:52:39.239,00:52:40.073,Yeah.
00:52:40.574,00:52:41.616,What are you doing here?
00:52:42.409,00:52:44.077,That's an excellent question.
00:52:45.579,00:52:50.375,The sad fact of the matter is I can't seem to get through 24 hours without you.
00:52:50.584,00:52:51.418,Aww...
00:52:52.252,00:52:54.504,"I've missed you, Peter Peter Colt."
00:52:54.880,00:52:55.714,You have?
00:52:56.548,00:52:57.549,But I need you to go.
00:52:57.632,00:52:58.884,"No, you need me to stay."
00:52:58.967,00:52:59.968,-Peter. -Lizzie.
00:53:00.051,00:53:00.886,-Peter. -Lizzie.
00:53:02.721,00:53:04.556,"People have fallen in love before, you know."
00:53:05.056,00:53:05.891,Oh.
00:53:05.974,00:53:07.559,Is that what we're doing here?
00:53:15.734,00:53:17.402,Good thing you didn't get the wrong room.
00:53:17.485,00:53:19.571,I did. But your dad's a very quick shag.
00:53:41.217,00:53:42.135,Have you seen it out?
00:53:42.218,00:53:45.722,The lark's on the wing and everything's for the best in this best of all possible worlds.
00:53:45.805,00:53:47.432,Because it's Semifinals day.
00:53:47.515,00:53:51.770,Which means it can only get better as Peter Colt stares down the racket of Pierre Maroux.
00:53:52.020,00:53:54.356,"Come on, can a Brit actually win this title?"
00:53:54.731,00:53:57.484,Who'd have thought we'd all live so long to even be saying that phrase?
00:54:19.839,00:54:21.466,He's off to a roaring start.
00:54:24.094,00:54:29.975,"was the '97 US Open Semis, a day I'm certain Peter Colt wants to wipe from the memory banks."
00:54:30.058,00:54:33.019,No kidding. It was the greatest opportunity of Colt's career.
00:54:33.103,00:54:35.772,"He was up two sets, and then he completely choked."
00:54:35.981,00:54:37.941,And I don't think he's ever fully recovered from it.
00:54:38.984,00:54:42.195,"You know, John, choking can be instigated by the smallest thing."
00:54:43.613,00:54:46.700,You wake up in the morning and something just isn't right.
00:54:47.659,00:54:49.786,Maybe a little superstition you have goes wrong.
00:54:51.121,00:54:53.581,And a seed of self-doubt is planted.
00:54:54.958,00:54:56.209,I love you!
00:54:56.376,00:55:00.463,"Then, everywhere you look, that feeling of doubt seems to be looking right back at you."
00:55:00.797,00:55:11.975,"Once that happens, all it takes is one point, one decisive point, that can make or break your confidence and completely determine the outcome of a match."
00:55:30.452,00:55:31.619,"Game, Miss Rupesindhe."
00:55:32.037,00:55:33.163,"Advantage, Colt."
00:55:36.791,00:55:39.169,"Well, there's no choking here today on Number 2 Court."
00:55:39.627,00:55:41.463,Peter Colt is firmly in control.
00:55:41.921,00:55:42.756,Thank you.
00:55:44.591,00:55:47.719,"from the Wimbledon Final on Sunday, against America's Jake Hammond."
00:56:14.871,00:56:18.333,"Well, he seems to be having trouble getting up from that awkward tumble just now."
00:56:19.292,00:56:20.877,Peter Colt's clearly in pain.
00:56:22.879,00:56:23.797,It's hard to tell.
00:56:24.798,00:56:27.092,This could spell disaster for the man who's captured the hearts...
00:56:27.175,00:56:28.635,"Come on, son, come on."
00:56:29.385,00:56:30.887,"Come on, pick yourself up, you can do it."
00:56:31.346,00:56:32.847,"Mr. Colt, are you okay?"
00:56:33.431,00:56:34.516,"Yeah, it's my back."
00:56:34.933,00:56:35.767,Can you get up?
00:56:37.185,00:56:38.103,Not entirely sure.
00:56:38.520,00:56:39.604,"One more point, come on."
00:56:39.938,00:56:41.231,He can't actually hear you.
00:56:42.524,00:56:43.483,"Oh, yes, he can."
00:56:43.566,00:56:46.736,"This is an eerie echo of the Tom Cavendish match, I must say."
00:56:47.070,00:56:49.989,"Well, he's back on his feet, -but will he be able to play on? -Oh, yes, he can."
00:56:50.073,00:56:50.949,That's the question.
00:56:51.866,00:56:53.284,"Well, only he knows how much it's hurting him."
00:56:53.368,00:56:55.411,"Oh, my God, the stress."
00:56:56.371,00:56:57.831,How does he deal with it?
00:57:01.000,00:57:02.293,How does who deal with it?
00:57:41.082,00:57:43.084,"But remember, you're one point away from the Finals."
00:57:45.211,00:57:46.254,but give me a break.
00:57:48.173,00:57:50.592,Your shoulder was killing you. And what did you do then?
00:57:50.675,00:57:52.302,"All right, all right!"
00:58:00.685,00:58:02.353,"Game, set, match, Colt."
00:58:02.729,00:58:04.898,"Colt wins, three sets to love."
00:58:04.981,00:58:07.358,"-6-2, 6-1, 6-3. -Yes!"
00:58:07.734,00:58:09.110,I knew he could do it.
00:58:11.321,00:58:16.409,"Who would have dreamt, two weeks ago, that the man time had forgotten, who'd all but retired..."
00:58:16.493,00:58:17.327,Rabbit.
00:58:17.744,00:58:19.913,I caught it messing with your lettuce.
00:58:20.747,00:58:21.789,Good man.
00:58:24.417,00:58:26.336,"Congratulations, Peter. Can we just do a quickie?"
00:58:26.419,00:58:27.337,"No, not right now."
00:58:30.465,00:58:31.466,How did she do?
00:58:33.843,00:58:35.845,and Lizzie just couldn't do anything right.
00:58:37.764,00:58:40.600,which Miss Bradbury found very difficult today.
00:58:40.975,00:58:41.809,Bugger.
00:58:42.602,00:58:44.437,"Well, it's not as if she can blame you, is it?"
00:58:45.897,00:58:49.609,"I told you I needed to focus, to be away from you for just a few days!"
00:58:50.109,00:58:53.780,"But no, instead you sneak into my room, you don't even have the decency to spend the night."
00:58:53.863,00:58:56.241,I had the earlier start and I thought you'd want the extra sleep.
00:58:56.324,00:58:58.243,I was some chick you picked up.
00:58:58.368,00:59:01.120,"Well, this chick is going back home to work on her serve."
00:59:01.621,00:59:03.706,"Listen, I am sorry about your match, I really am."
00:59:03.790,00:59:04.791,But please don't go.
00:59:04.874,00:59:07.001,Why? Because you need to screw me before the Finals.
00:59:07.085,00:59:09.003,Is that what you think? That's why you think I'm here?
00:59:09.087,00:59:10.880,"It's not? Really, Peter?"
00:59:13.174,00:59:14.467,"A-ha, you see!"
00:59:14.801,00:59:20.682,"I know you want me to think that we're falling in love or some bullshit, but the only thing you fell in love with this week was winning."
00:59:21.975,00:59:23.101,"Oh, yes, it is."
00:59:23.184,00:59:25.270,"And you know what? I love winning, too."
00:59:25.603,00:59:27.397,"More than anything, more than anyone."
00:59:28.648,00:59:29.899,"Don't say that, you don't mean it."
00:59:29.983,00:59:30.817,I do.
00:59:31.359,00:59:33.278,"Love means nothing in tennis, zero."
00:59:33.945,00:59:35.113,It only means you lose.
00:59:47.917,00:59:50.253,She's dropping her arm too soon after the toss.
01:00:15.278,01:00:16.863,"Love is shit, just like she said."
01:00:16.946,01:00:18.573,"Yeah, he's absolutely right."
01:00:18.656,01:00:20.700,Just ask my soon-to-be ex-wife.
01:00:20.783,01:00:22.118,Ask all my ex-wives.
01:00:22.201,01:00:23.703,"Thanks for the words of wisdom, Ron."
01:00:23.786,01:00:25.538,Shouldn't you be off sucking up to Jake?
01:00:25.622,01:00:26.956,"Yeah, I took care of that at breakfast."
01:00:29.542,01:00:31.836,You're the one in the Finals. It's time to move on. Same as she would.
01:00:33.004,01:00:34.631,-Ow! -I'll take that as a yes.
01:00:35.173,01:00:40.511,"Look, I'm not making any promises, but if you keep relatively still, you should be in a decent state for the Finals."
01:00:42.513,01:00:44.015,-Frito Lay! -What?
01:00:44.098,01:00:46.434,You are the new spokesperson for their brand new chip.
01:00:46.517,01:00:49.020,"Surprisingly Zesty, it's called. That's you, pal."
01:00:49.103,01:00:50.396,"Oh, God, I gotta get out of here."
01:00:50.480,01:00:52.148,No. No way. You heard the good doctor.
01:00:52.231,01:00:53.232,Let's get you some room service.
01:00:54.108,01:00:55.985,I would kill for another dozen of those...
01:00:56.069,01:00:59.197,What do you call those little cucumber sandwiches?
01:00:59.280,01:01:00.823,Cucumber sandwiches.
01:01:00.907,01:01:02.492,"You Brits got a name for everything, huh?"
01:01:02.784,01:01:09.916,"And in other news, the Kuiper Belt Comet, Armstrong Flynn, finally disappeared from view today, after blazing for nearly..."
01:01:23.971,01:01:25.098,"Oh, Jennifer."
01:02:07.932,01:02:09.225,"Yeah, all right. I'm going."
01:02:12.603,01:02:13.438,I'm going.
01:02:26.492,01:02:28.244,"Oh, for God's sake, Carl."
01:02:31.914,01:02:32.749,Carl!
01:02:36.085,01:02:37.295,"For God's sake, what..."
01:02:38.254,01:02:40.673,Didn't I tell you always to knock before entering a room?
01:02:41.549,01:02:42.967,"Well, it's a bit late now."
01:02:43.050,01:02:44.552,You'd better come in and have some breakfast.
01:02:45.261,01:02:46.679,What do you want? Eggs and soldiers?
01:02:48.389,01:02:49.432,"Oh, eggs will be fine."
01:02:50.183,01:02:51.017,Sit down.
01:02:53.603,01:02:55.354,"-Morning, son. -Where's the Marmite?"
01:03:12.079,01:03:14.290,"Well, I'm out of the tree house."
01:03:15.041,01:03:16.250,"Yeah, you certainly are."
01:03:17.251,01:03:20.755,Your mother and I seem to have found some common ground at long last.
01:03:21.297,01:03:22.381,"Oh, really? What's that?"
01:03:23.716,01:03:24.550,"You, Peter."
01:03:28.721,01:03:32.975,You're probably aware that things have been a bit sticky for the last few...
01:03:34.560,01:03:35.561,"Well, years, actually."
01:03:36.771,01:03:40.858,"The fact is that, uh, in the end, the only thing we shared was the downstairs toilet."
01:03:40.942,01:03:42.151,And she wasn't really keen on that.
01:03:48.533,01:03:50.284,I think what I'm trying to say is that...
01:03:51.911,01:03:55.498,we'd forgotten just what an inspiration you are to both of us.
01:03:57.083,01:03:59.794,"That's meant to be the other way around, actually, I know, but..."
01:04:01.420,01:04:03.214,And how very proud we are of you.
01:04:11.681,01:04:13.516,It's been a long time since we've done this.
01:04:14.600,01:04:15.685,Too bloody long.
01:04:16.936,01:04:17.770,Dad...
01:04:18.187,01:04:19.021,Hmm?
01:04:19.522,01:04:20.356,My back.
01:04:21.065,01:04:21.899,"Oh, God."
01:04:23.776,01:04:26.404,"Well, it's been quite a fortnight, hasn't it?"
01:04:26.946,01:04:28.823,"Not just for Peter, but for all of us."
01:04:29.782,01:04:45.464,"I, for one, will admit, and that's not a word I like very much, but we could all do better to love and support each other unconditionally, without judgment, without..."
01:04:45.840,01:04:48.134,"For God's sake, Carl, stop biting your fingernails."
01:04:48.217,01:04:49.427,-You're not a bloody infant. -Augusta!
01:04:51.220,01:04:52.388,"You were saying, darling?"
01:04:52.680,01:04:54.181,"Yes, I'm sorry."
01:04:54.932,01:04:56.934,I just wanted to propose a toast.
01:04:57.810,01:04:59.854,To the family. Our family.
01:05:00.187,01:05:01.022,It's a trick.
01:05:09.238,01:05:10.781,"Oh, bloody marvelous!"
01:05:10.865,01:05:12.617,"No, darling, we're bad luck."
01:05:13.409,01:05:15.620,"If we came and you lost, I would never be able to forgive myself."
01:05:16.787,01:05:18.080,I don't believe in luck anymore.
01:05:19.498,01:05:26.172,"Listen, win or lose, and I can't see how I'm possibly gonna win..."
01:05:27.548,01:05:29.717,tomorrow will be my last professional tennis match.
01:05:31.636,01:05:34.805,"And I can't imagine the three of you not being there, so, please."
01:05:37.058,01:05:40.061,"So, what you're saying is Jake's the safe bet, then?"
01:05:40.937,01:05:43.940,"Good morning, it's Radio One, it's seven o'clock, I'm Chris Moyles."
01:05:44.023,01:05:46.400,"So, today's the day. It's the big Finals."
01:05:46.484,01:05:48.361,"Peter Colt, what an amazing man."
01:05:48.444,01:05:50.738,Who would have thought? I didn't think he was gonna do it.
01:05:50.821,01:05:52.031,Now I'm starting to think he could do it.
01:05:54.825,01:05:57.578,"And it's here, it is Wimbledon Finals day!"
01:05:57.828,01:06:00.623,"I try to be detached, I try to be cool, but I'm carried away."
01:06:00.957,01:06:02.375,"Come on, Coltie."
01:06:06.712,01:06:08.047,"Good luck, Mr. Colt."
01:06:08.756,01:06:09.590,Thank you.
01:06:10.675,01:06:11.634,Thank you very much.
01:06:19.266,01:06:20.309,"All the best, Mr. Colt."
01:06:23.521,01:06:24.355,Thanks very much.
01:06:32.571,01:06:33.572,Thank you.
01:06:35.199,01:06:36.033,Thank you.
01:06:36.701,01:06:37.952,Thank you so much.
01:06:38.202,01:06:39.036,Thank you.
01:06:41.205,01:06:43.165,Thank you. Thank you.
01:06:43.499,01:06:44.500,Thank you so much.
01:06:46.293,01:06:48.713,An Englishman in a Final. Fantastic.
01:06:49.463,01:06:52.341,"If you can win that Cup, sir, we'd all be so proud."
01:06:52.425,01:06:53.426,I'll do my best.
01:06:55.678,01:06:57.054,And I don't even like tennis.
01:07:07.606,01:07:08.566,"Yeah, I think I am."
01:07:12.695,01:07:15.656,has already declared this to be his last competitive match.
01:07:15.740,01:07:16.824,And what an exit.
01:07:17.199,01:07:22.288,"Only a matter of days ago, Colt had become no more than a fading blip on the radar of tennis history."
01:07:22.913,01:07:24.457,Now he's become the man who...
01:07:32.715,01:07:37.595,"Not to add to the pressure, Peter, but you know the entire United Kingdom is cheering you on today."
01:07:38.471,01:07:39.305,Yes.
01:07:39.597,01:07:41.432,"Well, let's hope I don't disappoint them."
01:07:44.185,01:07:46.437,"that you would be here today, preparing to walk on..."
01:07:46.520,01:07:52.234,"Lizzie, I love you more than life itself, but I can't turn off every goddamn television set in the United Kingdom."
01:07:52.318,01:07:53.486,I'm going for a walk.
01:07:55.321,01:07:56.822,Flight boards in half an hour.
01:08:05.539,01:08:07.708,You were supposed to make a very early exit.
01:08:07.792,01:08:11.587,"Well, I had a bit of luck against Tom Cavendish in the Quarters."
01:08:11.670,01:08:13.631,And I played a more focused game...
01:08:15.716,01:08:17.760,...a more passionate game. Uh...
01:08:19.386,01:08:21.889,But I suppose the real answer to your question is...
01:08:23.099,01:08:25.935,"Well, love, really."
01:08:26.560,01:08:27.394,Love of the game?
01:08:28.938,01:08:30.481,"Yeah, love of the game. Um..."
01:08:32.733,01:08:36.487,"Listen, you may have read about Lizzie Bradbury and myself being..."
01:08:37.238,01:08:38.364,"involved, so to speak."
01:08:39.782,01:08:43.619,I'd like to take this opportunity to set the record straight.
01:08:44.328,01:08:46.330,"I read the papers this morning, and, um..."
01:08:46.997,01:08:50.501,they seem to imply that Lizzie had let me down in some way.
01:08:51.127,01:08:52.336,That's just not the case.
01:08:53.212,01:08:55.923,The truth is I let her down.
01:08:57.842,01:09:00.553,I let her down and for that...
01:09:02.096,01:09:03.764,I'll always be truly sorry.
01:09:11.939,01:09:14.275,as boarding will commence shortly.
01:09:18.487,01:09:20.406,"Listen, I'm not in the habit of..."
01:09:21.824,01:09:23.701,pouring my heart out on television.
01:09:24.952,01:09:27.121,Not really in the habit of pouring my heart out at all.
01:09:27.204,01:09:28.122,"Lizzie, sweetheart."
01:09:29.290,01:09:30.666,There's something I think you ought to see.
01:09:30.749,01:09:32.209,-So if this comes out wrong... -I'm seeing it.
01:09:32.293,01:09:33.127,...forgive me.
01:09:33.878,01:09:34.962,Lizzie Bradbury.
01:09:36.672,01:09:38.465,Lizzie is the reason that I'm here today.
01:09:43.804,01:09:47.057,"That's all I really came here to say, so, thank you."
01:10:00.362,01:10:03.824,I have a new theory of our life of tennis.
01:10:04.533,01:10:05.367,Tell me.
01:10:05.784,01:10:06.952,"Well, it's simple, really."
01:10:07.745,01:10:15.252,"You hit the ball back over the net, as hard and as deep and as often as possible."
01:10:17.254,01:10:18.839,"Sorry to disturb you, Peter."
01:10:19.673,01:10:22.635,The members have invited you to use the Number 1 dressing room.
01:10:24.595,01:10:26.138,"Oh, no, thank you, Danny."
01:10:27.556,01:10:28.891,I think I'd rather stay here.
01:10:29.225,01:10:30.059,Right.
01:10:31.143,01:10:32.603,That's what I told them you'd say.
01:10:46.575,01:10:47.576,"Good luck, my friend."
01:11:04.134,01:11:08.806,"A little stroll, Chrissie, that I'm sure you'd agree is about the number-one highlight of a tennis player's career."
01:11:14.979,01:11:17.147,"No, 'cause we don't have an endorsement deal, that's why."
01:11:17.773,01:11:19.149,"Well, then, he knows the number."
01:11:46.510,01:11:47.761,I tried to warn you about her.
01:11:50.556,01:11:52.016,"By the way, how's the weak back?"
01:11:54.601,01:11:55.561,It's fine.
01:11:56.270,01:11:57.104,Thanks.
01:11:58.814,01:11:59.982,How's the weak mind?
01:12:15.956,01:12:16.957,Fuck a duck.
01:12:33.557,01:12:35.642,Jake Hammond has been on an absolute tear.
01:12:36.185,01:12:38.771,He's lost only one set this entire tournament.
01:12:38.854,01:12:41.148,"And look who he's had to beat. Hewitt, Federer."
01:12:41.231,01:12:52.743,"Well, with the exception of Dragomir and Tom Cavendish, Colt's road to this Final But my guess here is that he's more than a little overmatched today."
01:12:55.245,01:12:57.664,First set. Hammond to serve.
01:13:05.798,01:13:06.632,I gotta go.
01:13:16.100,01:13:16.934,Ready?
01:13:19.395,01:13:20.229,Play.
01:13:27.820,01:13:28.737,15-love.
01:13:33.826,01:13:35.369,"Yes, thanks, I'll be needing that."
01:13:36.537,01:13:38.122,"He said, Thanks, I'll be needing that."
01:13:44.086,01:13:44.962,"Quiet, please."
01:14:03.355,01:14:04.189,30-love.
01:14:05.482,01:14:09.778,He was on the receiving end of one of the fastest recorded serves in professional tennis.
01:14:10.154,01:14:12.239,144 miles per hour.
01:14:17.911,01:14:23.000,"Chrissie, I ball-boyed in the old days when they used wood rackets and things were a lot slower."
01:14:29.756,01:14:32.676,"It's one thing to humiliate me, but you didn't have to mess with the boy."
01:14:33.093,01:14:35.179,"Now you're going down, you bastard."
01:14:37.055,01:14:37.890,Oh!
01:14:40.017,01:14:41.143,Or maybe not.
01:14:44.688,01:14:45.731,Love-15.
01:14:46.482,01:14:47.524,Love-40.
01:14:48.650,01:14:49.943,"Game, Hammond."
01:14:50.360,01:14:51.320,40-love.
01:14:51.820,01:14:53.739,"Game and first set, Hammond."
01:14:54.364,01:14:55.199,30-love.
01:14:55.699,01:14:56.617,"Game, Hammond."
01:14:56.950,01:14:58.118,"New balls, please."
01:15:00.245,01:15:01.330,Love-15.
01:15:02.414,01:15:04.708,"Hammond leads, five games to two."
01:15:06.001,01:15:07.002,"Game, Hammond."
01:15:07.419,01:15:08.462,Love-30.
01:15:08.837,01:15:10.130,15-30.
01:15:17.095,01:15:18.305,15-40.
01:15:26.104,01:15:30.192,He really can't afford to go down another break this early in the third set.
01:15:30.275,01:15:32.736,"He seems completely lost out there, John."
01:15:34.738,01:15:38.492,We may be witnessing the near total collapse of a player's game.
01:15:38.575,01:15:43.914,"At a moment like this, Chrissie, you have to wonder, what the hell is going through Peter Colt's mind?"
01:16:11.942,01:16:13.902,"Game, Hammond. Play suspended."
01:16:25.622,01:16:27.040,"What are you doing, lad?"
01:16:27.583,01:16:28.417,Get in here!
01:16:39.011,01:16:40.846,"It ain't over till the handshake, lad."
01:16:41.597,01:16:44.308,"You know what, Danny, I'm not really in the mood for a pep talk right now."
01:16:44.391,01:16:45.642,"Well, you better get ready for one."
01:16:52.566,01:16:53.567,Hi.
01:16:55.068,01:16:56.194,I thought you'd gone.
01:16:57.696,01:16:59.573,"Yeah. Me, too."
01:17:02.993,01:17:03.827,Having a tough day?
01:17:06.163,01:17:08.624,"Well, you know, disastrous."
01:17:11.293,01:17:14.379,Except for the fact that you didn't go gooey when the ball boy got hit.
01:17:14.963,01:17:15.797,Yeah.
01:17:16.548,01:17:17.382,Sorry.
01:17:18.300,01:17:20.552,Why are you British apologizing all the time?
01:17:20.844,01:17:22.888,"Don't apologize to me, I love you."
01:17:22.971,01:17:24.806,Apologize to the people who are rooting for you out there.
01:17:24.890,01:17:25.724,What did you say?
01:17:26.141,01:17:29.519,"I said that the whole country has been waiting-- No, no, the other bit."
01:17:31.355,01:17:32.522,I said I love you.
01:17:39.446,01:17:40.989,"See, that's very good news."
01:17:41.531,01:17:43.575,I thought I was alone in the love department.
01:17:43.867,01:17:46.244,"Well, it turns out you've got company."
01:17:49.247,01:17:50.457,-I am so sorry. -Oh!
01:17:51.083,01:17:53.794,"If you say sorry one more time, you're gonna be sorry."
01:17:53.877,01:17:55.962,-I meant about the other night. -Shh! Stop it.
01:17:56.046,01:17:57.172,Forget about that.
01:17:58.924,01:18:00.008,This is about you.
01:18:01.426,01:18:04.304,Go out there and decide who you are.
01:18:06.306,01:18:07.391,And who might that be?
01:18:08.100,01:18:09.267,That might be a winner.
01:18:11.561,01:18:14.231,"Please be patient, Mr. Hammond. Please sit down."
01:18:17.109,01:18:19.111,Did he flee the building with the rain?
01:18:19.444,01:18:20.654,I think he's in the lavatory.
01:18:20.737,01:18:22.364,Isn't that a comfort break?
01:18:22.447,01:18:24.074,-Is it? -Yes. They are allowed one.
01:18:24.449,01:18:25.909,Perhaps he's got a gippy tummy.
01:18:27.369,01:18:30.497,"So, if he doesn't come back..."
01:18:31.164,01:18:32.249,He's gonna lose.
01:18:32.958,01:18:34.793,"Of course I wanna win, I do."
01:18:36.002,01:18:37.129,But he's just better than me.
01:18:37.212,01:18:38.380,"No, he's not."
01:18:41.216,01:18:43.051,"Two sets down, my back is killing me."
01:18:43.135,01:18:44.386,You'll play through the pain.
01:18:44.469,01:18:45.429,I'm too tired.
01:18:45.846,01:18:46.847,My legs are like lead.
01:18:46.930,01:18:49.641,-Find a second wind. It's what winners do. -His serve is unstoppable.
01:18:49.725,01:18:51.476,"-I'm not-- -No, it's not, it's a bundle of tells."
01:18:53.687,01:18:54.521,What?
01:18:54.604,01:18:58.358,"His serve, it's like a book, you just have to know how to read it."
01:18:59.317,01:19:02.195,"I really don't care who wins. I mean, I represent both players."
01:19:02.279,01:19:04.281,It's like asking me which one of my kids I love more.
01:19:05.365,01:19:06.950,Which one of my kids do I love more?
01:19:08.368,01:19:09.828,My daughter. I'll talk to you later.
01:19:16.334,01:19:18.336,"So far, this match has been a blowout."
01:19:18.420,01:19:19.671,"Yeah, Pete!"
01:19:20.380,01:19:21.214,Peter!
01:19:27.053,01:19:32.976,"Ladies and gentlemen, as play resumes, Hammond leads two sets to love and one game to love."
01:19:34.811,01:19:35.937,Hammond to serve.
01:19:36.438,01:19:37.272,Play.
01:19:54.456,01:19:55.791,he's going for the body.
01:19:57.459,01:20:02.714,"If he shifts back on his left heel and shows you his toe, it means he's hitting deep."
01:20:10.597,01:20:14.309,which is a good sign if he's gonna climb out of the giant hole he's dug himself.
01:20:15.477,01:20:16.686,Ouch! Are you all right?
01:20:16.770,01:20:17.604,Yes.
01:20:18.021,01:20:18.855,Welcome back.
01:20:19.105,01:20:20.106,"Same to you, sir."
01:20:21.274,01:20:22.651,Station ident ready to roll.
01:20:24.736,01:20:25.570,Eight.
01:20:25.946,01:20:26.780,Top of your shot.
01:20:27.739,01:20:28.698,We got a visitor.
01:20:28.782,01:20:30.617,"John, did you see who just came in?"
01:20:39.584,01:20:40.836,-Yes! -Whoo!
01:20:40.919,01:20:42.546,"He did it, Chrissie, he pulled up his set."
01:20:53.598,01:20:54.432,Oh!
01:20:57.185,01:20:58.019,Yes!
01:21:11.700,01:21:16.246,Colt's game has leveled and he and Jake Hammond are even at 5-all in this tiebreak.
01:21:16.329,01:21:21.209,"So, John, this next point is crucial if Colt -wants to keep this comeback alive. -Come on, Peter!"
01:21:23.587,01:21:24.421,Here we go.
01:21:43.690,01:21:46.693,and has finally gotten himself a Championship point.
01:21:47.485,01:21:52.949,"This could be the final point of Peter Colt's pro career right here, right now."
01:22:01.958,01:22:04.711,"Or is it the toss? Yes, if he tosses high, it..."
01:22:05.337,01:22:06.212,"Oh, sod it!"
01:22:24.356,01:22:27.025,I'm doing a complete 180 on Peter Colt.
01:22:27.108,01:22:29.277,This is amazing persistence from the journeyman player.
01:22:30.070,01:22:32.030,I was already thinking about getting to the airport.
01:22:34.157,01:22:35.825,We may be going to a fifth set.
01:22:35.909,01:22:38.954,"If I was Jake Hammond, I'd wanna close this thing out right now."
01:22:39.037,01:22:42.958,The last thing he wants is another set with the momentum going in the other direction.
01:22:44.459,01:22:46.294,"Okay, first one to win by two."
01:23:13.196,01:23:15.281,Now it looks like Hammond's the one who's getting tight.
01:23:15.365,01:23:19.119,Peter Colt now has set point to force a fifth and deciding set.
01:23:33.842,01:23:35.844,Oh! Give us a goddamn break!
01:23:45.145,01:23:45.979,Yeah?
01:24:13.089,01:24:13.923,Yes!
01:24:18.803,01:24:21.514,"After a disastrous start, Peter Colt has battled back..."
01:24:37.030,01:24:38.364,Peter Colt-san.
01:24:49.751,01:24:52.045,"Colt leads, five games to four."
01:24:52.128,01:24:52.962,Final set.
01:24:55.882,01:24:58.968,"And after this changeover, he's gonna be serving for the Wimbledon title."
01:25:01.304,01:25:02.472,to give him a ride home.
01:25:05.225,01:25:08.019,"I mean, he's finally got a chance to serve out the match."
01:25:18.363,01:25:19.906,"Break you right back, asshole."
01:25:22.075,01:25:25.036,That is some definite gamesmanship from Jake Hammond.
01:25:31.376,01:25:32.418,"Come on, Peter."
01:25:48.768,01:25:49.602,Come on!
01:26:00.071,01:26:01.197,One point at a time.
01:26:01.281,01:26:03.616,"It's just another point, it's just another point."
01:26:04.701,01:26:05.785,Like hell it is!
01:26:05.869,01:26:07.370,You could be the champion of Wimbledon.
01:26:07.453,01:26:10.081,"Which means you wouldn't have to take the pro job, for starters."
01:26:10.165,01:26:11.875,"You could buy a new place, redecorate."
01:26:11.958,01:26:13.042,Lizzie could help with that.
01:26:13.376,01:26:15.211,God knows what taste she has.
01:26:15.879,01:26:17.589,"Oh, shut up, you silly ponce!"
01:26:47.702,01:26:48.703,"Oh, my God."
01:26:48.786,01:26:49.662,"Oh, my God."
01:26:56.294,01:26:57.128,"Come on, Pete."
01:27:15.271,01:27:17.440,as a choker when it comes to big points.
01:27:17.523,01:27:19.484,"Well, this is primo choke time."
01:27:19.567,01:27:22.695,I wouldn't be surprised if Colt got real tight now.
01:27:22.779,01:27:23.988,-Thank you. -It's my fault.
01:27:33.206,01:27:35.416,Please don't choke. Please don't choke. Don't choke.
01:27:37.377,01:27:38.670,"I'm not gonna choke, damn it."
01:27:51.140,01:27:53.726,Peter!
01:27:56.187,01:27:59.232,Peter Colt is serving at Championship point.
01:28:03.528,01:28:06.364,"Ladies and gentlemen. Quiet, please."
01:28:10.493,01:28:11.327,"Right, then."
01:28:21.421,01:28:22.255,Out!
01:28:24.299,01:28:26.092,-That was a terrible call for Colt. -No!
01:28:26.551,01:28:27.427,What the hell?
01:28:27.760,01:28:28.594,What?
01:28:29.262,01:28:31.681,"Look at the chalk fly, the ball was definitely in."
01:28:31.764,01:28:33.016,It was on the line!
01:28:33.099,01:28:34.767,It was on the line!
01:28:34.851,01:28:37.228,I'd be torching the stadium about now.
01:28:38.313,01:28:40.523,Excuse me. The ball was good.
01:28:41.691,01:28:43.860,"Oh, come on, the ball was good, chalk flew up."
01:28:43.943,01:28:45.069,The whole stadium saw it.
01:28:45.153,01:28:47.280,"I don't know if you've noticed, but it's quite an important point."
01:28:47.572,01:28:49.991,That's too close for me to overrule.
01:28:50.074,01:28:51.200,Please resume play.
01:28:51.284,01:28:53.619,Absolutely not. I'm not playing on. It's complete bollocks!
01:28:53.703,01:28:55.496,Absolutely bollocks!
01:28:56.956,01:28:58.583,Unsportsmanlike conduct.
01:29:01.836,01:29:02.837,"Oh, my..."
01:29:08.217,01:29:11.679,Peter Colt has a second chance now to win the Championship.
01:29:13.973,01:29:20.271,"After a call like that, a lot of players, including yours truly, would have a hard time getting back in the mindset."
01:29:48.049,01:29:49.217,You have to stop it.
01:30:49.193,01:30:52.321,The journeyman has won. A wild card entry.
01:30:52.405,01:30:56.242,Ranked 119th in the world. Now Champion of Wimbledon!
01:31:11.257,01:31:14.844,"Call Letterman, call Leno, call Oprah, call Kimmel."
01:31:21.350,01:31:23.603,I've never seen anything like this in my life.
01:31:23.895,01:31:26.147,The Brits finally have a winner.
01:31:26.230,01:31:27.815,What's wrong with you? You bet on Jake?
01:31:27.899,01:31:29.650,"I put it all on you, bro."
01:31:31.861,01:31:33.112,"Can I retire now, Mum?"
01:31:33.571,01:31:35.031,-Certainly not! -Augusta!
01:31:35.281,01:31:36.324,"Well done, son."
01:31:36.407,01:31:37.241,I love you.
01:31:56.552,01:31:58.304,There's so much I wanna say to you.
01:31:59.180,01:32:00.598,I'm not going anywhere.
01:32:00.681,01:32:01.849,"Oh, yes, you are."
01:32:02.350,01:32:03.809,"You're going a long, long way."
01:32:13.653,01:32:15.529,It's everything you wait a lifetime for.
01:32:16.364,01:32:18.866,"That dream, finally come true."
01:32:19.909,01:32:21.619,What else could ever come close?
01:32:22.870,01:32:23.996,"Except this, maybe."
01:32:25.039,01:32:26.332,I did take a job at a club.
01:32:26.415,01:32:29.126,"But teaching young kids like my own, not old ladies."
01:32:30.711,01:32:31.796,I beat you! I beat you!
01:32:31.921,01:32:34.048,"Rubbish. The ball was in, it was definitely-- Ow!"
01:32:34.131,01:32:35.508,"Well, most of the time."
01:32:37.843,01:32:41.973,"You see, a part of me was always afraid that my life would be over if I wasn't playing tennis."
01:32:42.431,01:32:45.017,"But the truth is, it was really just beginning."
01:32:46.852,01:32:50.564,"Oh, and by the way, Lizzie did win the US Open and Wimbledon."
01:32:52.024,01:32:52.858,Twice.
