00:00:26.151,00:00:29.738,"stupid haircuts, Jazzercise, and Just Say No."
00:00:29.821,00:00:32.115,It all fucking sucked!
00:00:32.907,00:00:35.702,"So, what do you do when you're born in the wrong time?"
00:00:35.785,00:00:37.245,You make it yours.
00:00:37.328,00:00:40.123,And that's what we did to the Sunset Strip.
00:00:48.882,00:00:53.053,"Every weekend, kids from the Valley to the beach flooded the strip."
00:00:53.595,00:00:56.806,"And after the shows, they brought the party to our place."
00:01:01.352,00:01:04.939,"The cops kicked in our door so many times, we had to nail it shut."
00:01:06.357,00:01:08.234,So everybody used the window.
00:01:12.113,00:01:16.159,"That's Tommy, our drummer. He makes a lot of bad choices."
00:01:17.077,00:01:19.329,Check this out. You're gonna fucking freak!
00:01:26.544,00:01:27.462,Wow.
00:01:28.546,00:01:29.506,Kayla?
00:01:30.006,00:01:31.132,"Hey, open the door."
00:01:31.674,00:01:34.052,"I know you're in there, Kayla. Come on, open the door."
00:01:34.969,00:01:36.179,Is that really you?
00:01:36.930,00:01:38.139,What the fuck do you think?
00:01:39.849,00:01:44.312,"He's not thinking about her, he's thinking, Damn, I look good on that flyer."
00:01:44.854,00:01:45.939,Hey.
00:01:46.022,00:01:47.565,"Hey, are you in the band?"
00:01:48.066,00:01:48.983,What band?
00:01:51.444,00:01:52.821,He's an alien.
00:01:57.033,00:01:59.202,-What were you doing in there? -Don't worry about it!
00:02:04.374,00:02:05.834,"Holy shit, guys. Here it comes."
00:02:17.095,00:02:21.766,"I guess if I'm gonna tell this story right, we should start with my happy childhood."
00:02:21.850,00:02:24.769,So let's go back to before I was Nikki Sixx.
00:02:25.019,00:02:27.939,Back to Frank Carlton Feranna Jr.
00:02:28.022,00:02:29.023,That's me.
00:02:29.440,00:02:33.444,"My dad named me that after himself, right before he split."
00:02:33.820,00:02:35.572,Which just left me with these three things.
00:02:35.822,00:02:39.492,Up and down. I told you to brush up and down.
00:02:41.578,00:02:42.996,Piece of shit!
00:02:47.458,00:02:48.459,Mom?
00:02:51.754,00:02:52.839,And music.
00:03:01.681,00:03:03.892,"Turn it fucking down, Frankie."
00:03:12.942,00:03:13.985,What's that?
00:03:14.652,00:03:15.820,What's it look like?
00:03:16.946,00:03:18.072,Where'd you get it?
00:03:18.489,00:03:19.699,He probably stole it.
00:03:19.782,00:03:21.117,Who the fuck is this guy?
00:03:21.534,00:03:24.370,You think I don't know where you got all this shit?!
00:03:24.746,00:03:27.457,"So you noticed something I did, for once!"
00:03:27.540,00:03:30.210,"Don't you talk to your mother like that, you little prick."
00:03:30.293,00:03:32.795,Seriously? Who the fuck are you?
00:03:33.963,00:03:36.049,Y'know what? I don't even care.
00:03:36.758,00:03:39.010,"Gonna be another you tomorrow, anyways."
00:03:40.136,00:03:41.804,You wanna know who this is?
00:03:42.430,00:03:45.934,He's another man in my life that you're gonna drive away...
00:03:46.392,00:03:48.311,just like you did your fucking father!
00:03:48.394,00:03:50.271,"I was two years old, you bitch!"
00:03:50.855,00:03:52.315,He left you!
00:03:59.989,00:04:02.909,"Then how come he never tried to call you then, Frankie?"
00:04:04.994,00:04:06.120,Fuck you!
00:04:07.997,00:04:09.624,Get the fuck outta here!
00:04:10.583,00:04:12.585,"Open the fucking door, Frankie!"
00:04:17.507,00:04:18.383,God damn it!
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.262,You little shit! Open the fucking door!
00:04:24.055,00:04:31.396,"Open the fucking-- No! No, baby! No! No!"
00:04:31.896,00:04:33.898,"What are you doing, baby?!"
00:04:40.571,00:04:43.992,"Frankie, will you please tell her what happened?"
00:04:47.662,00:04:48.830,I am calm.
00:04:50.290,00:04:51.291,Frankie.
00:04:52.500,00:04:54.961,"Frank, you need to be honest about what happened."
00:04:55.044,00:04:57.922,"So, you're sticking to your story?"
00:04:58.464,00:05:00.174,She attacked you with a knife?
00:05:02.343,00:05:03.219,Yep.
00:05:10.560,00:05:12.353,"Here's what's gonna happen, Frank."
00:05:12.937,00:05:18.651,"If we take her away, the state is gonna put you in a juvenile home until you're 18."
00:05:19.736,00:05:21.029,Is that what you want?
00:05:28.953,00:05:31.456,"I'm gonna give you a moment with your son, so..."
00:05:33.416,00:05:34.459,behave yourself.
00:05:38.421,00:05:39.756,"Come on, Frankie."
00:05:40.631,00:05:42.133,Why are you doing this?
00:05:42.842,00:05:43.885,I'm your mother!
00:05:44.385,00:05:45.970,Are you fucking kidding me?
00:05:46.596,00:05:51.351,"I wanted a mom, but you only care about yourself and all of your stupid boyfriends."
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.062,"-Listen to me, Frankie. -No, you listen to me, okay?"
00:05:54.437,00:05:55.480,I'm not gonna see you.
00:05:56.230,00:05:57.899,I'm not gonna answer to you.
00:05:58.649,00:06:00.401,You're just gonna leave me alone...
00:06:00.943,00:06:02.028,Deana.
00:06:05.448,00:06:06.407,Frankie...
00:06:10.161,00:06:10.995,Fine.
00:06:12.830,00:06:13.831,Do what you want.
00:06:19.587,00:06:22.590,I knew what I needed. It just took me a while to get there.
00:06:23.383,00:06:25.385,I ended up on the streets of Hollywood.
00:06:25.468,00:06:32.642,"I was broke and starving, and I had no one to trust, so I made the mistake that many unwanted children make."
00:06:33.768,00:06:35.353,I went chasing ghosts.
00:06:44.779,00:06:46.656,Is this Frank Feranna?
00:06:47.490,00:06:48.533,Who's this?
00:06:49.909,00:06:51.953,"Oh, hi, Mr. Feranna."
00:06:53.287,00:06:54.789,This is your son...
00:06:55.540,00:06:57.333,-Frank Jr. -Son?
00:06:59.293,00:07:00.837,"-No, my-- -I don't know who you are."
00:07:00.920,00:07:05.341,"No, my mother, she's Deana-- Don't call here again."
00:07:19.105,00:07:21.399,And the last time I used his name.
00:07:27.363,00:07:28.448,Nikki Sixx?
00:08:12.742,00:08:15.786,"How much time is Nikki gonna get in this movie, bro? Fuck!"
00:08:16.162,00:08:18.247,"This dude tried to put his own mother in jail, man."
00:08:18.331,00:08:22.627,"I mean, I love him, but sometimes, it's dysfunction junction over there, you know what I mean?"
00:08:22.710,00:08:24.128,"See, I'm not like that."
00:08:25.171,00:08:27.381,"I'm just a hopeless fuckin' romantic, dude."
00:08:27.840,00:08:29.634,"All love, all the time."
00:08:30.718,00:08:31.594,Yeah.
00:08:31.677,00:08:33.054,Hey.
00:08:33.137,00:08:35.264,"-Hey. -So, who's on tonight?"
00:08:35.973,00:08:36.933,Those dudes.
00:08:37.600,00:08:40.728,"They've been selling out weekends at the Starwood, which is, like, huge."
00:08:43.439,00:08:46.609,"-Good try, Pop. -Your mom made dinner. You coming down?"
00:08:46.943,00:08:50.029,-I'm already late to pick up my girl. -You got a new girlfriend?
00:08:50.112,00:08:52.740,"Yeah, but I think I'm in love this time for real."
00:08:58.579,00:08:59.580,Aah!
00:09:01.749,00:09:03.125,"-Thanks, Mom. -You're welcome."
00:09:03.209,00:09:04.168,"Thank you, sweetie."
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.838,"God! Get a room, guys."
00:09:08.172,00:09:10.091,Eat. You're too skinny.
00:09:10.424,00:09:11.425,"Yeah, chicken legs!"
00:09:11.509,00:09:12.635,You got 'em too.
00:09:14.095,00:09:16.472,"Oh, my God! Those are my pants. Mom!"
00:09:17.181,00:09:18.015,But...
00:09:19.016,00:09:20.601,they look so much better on me!
00:09:21.727,00:09:22.979,"Later, creators!"
00:09:23.187,00:09:24.105,Mom!
00:09:24.814,00:09:26.691,You should have told him to take them off!
00:09:29.151,00:09:30.403,That rocked!
00:09:30.945,00:09:32.405,It was way better than the last time!
00:09:32.488,00:09:34.949,Did they fight each other on stage last time?
00:09:35.032,00:09:36.242,That was the rad part!
00:09:41.122,00:09:41.956,"Two, please."
00:09:48.379,00:09:49.797,Dude! Dude!
00:09:50.756,00:09:52.008,Don't look. Wait.
00:09:52.633,00:09:54.719,"Okay, look now, but don't look like you're looking."
00:09:55.886,00:09:58.764,"Oh, fuck! You totally look like you're looking."
00:09:59.765,00:10:00.975,That's Nikki fucking Sixx.
00:10:01.684,00:10:03.978,-Who? -From the band we just saw.
00:10:05.730,00:10:06.689,Should I go talk to him?
00:10:07.690,00:10:08.816,"I should talk to him, right?"
00:10:08.899,00:10:10.151,"Yeah, I guess."
00:10:10.234,00:10:11.360,Be right back.
00:10:18.701,00:10:20.161,"Hey, that was badass, dude."
00:10:21.162,00:10:22.955,"The show, not the nose, but..."
00:10:23.956,00:10:26.542,-Nose was pretty badass too. -The singer's an asshole.
00:10:26.626,00:10:28.919,"I know. I saw. Hey, fuck him, though. He deserved it."
00:10:31.255,00:10:33.132,I got your poster on my bedroom wall.
00:10:37.553,00:10:38.971,I can't believe I just said that.
00:10:39.055,00:10:41.140,"Take the fucking poster down, man."
00:10:41.724,00:10:42.725,London's over.
00:10:43.100,00:10:44.810,"Anything else I can get you, boys?"
00:10:44.894,00:10:46.937,Could you get me a Jack and Coke?
00:10:48.481,00:10:51.150,"-And for you, hon? -Blueberry pancakes, please."
00:10:51.942,00:10:55.821,My new band is gonna be something nobody's ever fuckin' seen before.
00:11:00.618,00:11:02.078,That dude looks pretty cool.
00:11:04.622,00:11:06.123,Do you carry those with you everywhere?
00:11:06.666,00:11:07.500,Yeah.
00:11:08.501,00:11:09.710,Where'd you learn to do that?
00:11:11.337,00:11:12.713,High school marching band.
00:11:13.339,00:11:14.507,"Hey, but I rock too."
00:11:16.300,00:11:18.803,"-Thank you, Dottie. -Only for you."
00:11:21.013,00:11:22.014,Whoa!
00:11:43.661,00:11:45.287,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
00:11:45.371,00:11:48.124,"What the fuck, dude? That's not what I showed you, man."
00:11:48.207,00:11:51.961,"Yeah, I know, but it's not like anything I've ever played before, man."
00:11:53.170,00:11:54.630,"That's the fucking point, man."
00:11:54.964,00:11:56.173,Let's take a break.
00:11:56.674,00:12:02.596,"Well, I-- -Tommy. -It's all good, man."
00:12:12.356,00:12:13.190,Shit.
00:12:13.482,00:12:19.071,"I'm just not feeling it, man. I can't put my-- He's a rhythm guy, man. We'll sound better when we find a lead."
00:12:21.824,00:12:23.284,Holy shit.
00:12:24.910,00:12:26.203,Check this dude out.
00:12:32.877,00:12:33.711,Fuck.
00:12:34.795,00:12:36.797,"Whoa, dude. You got it?"
00:12:38.507,00:12:40.217,-Here for the audition? -Yep.
00:12:41.051,00:12:43.137,"-Well, I'm Tommy. -Mick Mars."
00:12:43.220,00:12:45.556,-I'm the drummer. -Scrawny for a drummer.
00:12:45.639,00:12:47.057,"I used to be in Suite 19, so..."
00:12:47.141,00:12:48.267,Shitty band.
00:12:48.851,00:12:51.687,"-Hey, man, did you ever even see us play? -Suite 19?"
00:12:51.771,00:12:52.772,-Yeah. -Don't need to.
00:12:53.439,00:12:56.484,"Band with a shitty name, ten times out of ten, shitty band. Hey."
00:12:56.817,00:12:58.736,"-Hey, man. -What the fuck do you know?"
00:12:59.069,00:13:01.155,Been in a lot of bands with shitty names.
00:13:25.971,00:13:28.182,Whoa! Whoa! Hold up!
00:13:28.265,00:13:32.436,"Hey, you mind turning down a little bit, old timer? I can't hear myself."
00:13:33.395,00:13:34.396,Jesus!
00:13:37.149,00:13:38.526,Fucking hippie ain't gonna make it.
00:13:39.360,00:13:40.319,So tell him.
00:13:45.241,00:13:46.367,Listen to me.
00:13:46.450,00:13:50.371,"There's only room for one guitar player in this band, and that's me."
00:13:50.454,00:13:51.789,So why don't you...
00:13:52.832,00:13:54.333,pack up your toys and go home?
00:13:56.669,00:13:58.754,"Okay, I was here first, all right?"
00:13:59.171,00:14:00.089,"Tommy, tell him."
00:14:03.092,00:14:04.218,Nikki? Come on!
00:14:07.221,00:14:08.055,Really?!
00:14:08.722,00:14:10.933,You're gonna listen to this old dude over me?
00:14:12.351,00:14:14.270,"Then fuck you guys, man."
00:14:15.521,00:14:17.523,And your shitty fucking band.
00:14:24.029,00:14:26.949,"-So how old are you, Mick? -Fuck you, you fucking teenager."
00:14:28.284,00:14:29.451,What did I say?
00:14:31.829,00:14:33.372,"to these kids, I was ancient."
00:14:34.707,00:14:39.128,But they didn't know I was slowly becoming a fucking cripple too.
00:14:41.797,00:14:44.466,Ankylosing spondylitis.
00:14:45.384,00:14:47.928,It's a degenerative bone disease.
00:14:48.012,00:14:52.850,It affects the joints and the ligaments that allow your spine to move.
00:14:56.061,00:14:57.396,It's a curse.
00:14:57.479,00:15:06.655,"It's like hot, quick-drying cement growing on the inside of your spine, making it so heavy, over the years, it starts to pull you to the ground."
00:15:13.037,00:15:14.788,you're goddamn right I'm old.
00:15:16.457,00:15:21.962,Old enough to know better than to waste my time fucking around with a bunch of rug-monkeys.
00:15:23.130,00:15:32.348,"I'm paying child support and sleeping on park benches, so I need to know you're not pulling dick here 'cause I'm looking to go the distance."
00:15:32.890,00:15:37.102,"And if that's not you guys, let's not waste the fucking time."
00:15:38.687,00:15:42.024,"-I fucking love this weird little guy. -He's real, dude."
00:15:45.277,00:15:46.111,Sorry.
00:15:46.820,00:15:47.655,So...
00:15:48.906,00:15:51.575,someone mind telling me who does the singing in this band?
00:15:51.659,00:16:00.417,"What we need is a dude that looks like David Lee Roth with a vibe like fucking Bowie, and I'm not about to settle for some regular looking, normal sounding asshole."
00:16:00.960,00:16:01.794,So...
00:16:02.544,00:16:05.130,"we're looking for a skinny, blond fucker with moves."
00:16:09.051,00:16:11.345,"Wait. I think I know our guy, dudes."
00:16:19.853,00:16:21.563,"-Hey! -What's up, man?"
00:16:34.118,00:16:35.494,A fucking cover band?
00:16:36.036,00:16:38.706,"Yeah, but I'm telling you, I went to high school with this dude."
00:16:41.750,00:16:44.294,"Okay, that is exactly who we need."
00:16:55.431,00:16:56.724,His voice ain't bad.
00:16:58.100,00:17:01.437,I don't care if he can sing or not. Look what he's doing to those chicks.
00:17:14.116,00:17:15.325,"Yeah, Vinnie!"
00:17:20.205,00:17:23.417,Woo! Thank you. We're Rock Candy!
00:17:23.500,00:17:24.710,Shitty name.
00:17:30.340,00:17:31.759,"He's fucking perfect, man."
00:17:32.342,00:17:33.510,He's pretty good.
00:17:33.594,00:17:34.595,Got moves.
00:17:41.852,00:17:43.729,They say you're gonna be a rock star.
00:17:44.938,00:17:45.814,"Oh, yeah?"
00:17:46.899,00:17:47.816,Is it true?
00:17:48.484,00:17:49.985,What the fuck do you think?
00:18:03.082,00:18:05.000,"Tommy, damn!"
00:18:05.084,00:18:06.251,"Come here, fucker!"
00:18:07.753,00:18:09.004,"Good to see you, man."
00:18:09.922,00:18:12.508,"I'm in a band now, dude. With those guys right there."
00:18:16.762,00:18:19.681,"Dude, we watched you kill it today, man. You've gotta come jam with us."
00:18:20.015,00:18:22.392,"Come on, I got something going on. I can't."
00:18:22.476,00:18:24.478,"Oh, fuck that, man. Listen to this."
00:18:24.561,00:18:25.979,My number's on the front. Call us.
00:18:26.063,00:18:27.689,"-All right, later. -See you soon."
00:18:28.941,00:18:30.025,I think he's in.
00:18:35.280,00:18:39.284,"I was in a band to get laid, not scare chicks away."
00:18:42.871,00:18:45.207,What did you wanna be when you grew up?
00:18:46.500,00:18:48.460,Not a fucking electrician...
00:18:49.002,00:18:51.630,"getting pissed on all day, I'll tell you that much."
00:18:58.137,00:19:00.180,I think it's important for us to...
00:19:00.973,00:19:03.934,"like, say what we want in life, you know? It's like..."
00:19:04.685,00:19:07.271,"if you say it enough, it just kinda happens."
00:19:08.147,00:19:10.274,Like the universe is listening.
00:19:10.732,00:19:12.693,"-Come on, try it. -Oh..."
00:19:12.818,00:19:14.945,Say what you really want more than anything.
00:19:15.028,00:19:18.031,-What I really want more than anything? -More than anything.
00:19:22.244,00:19:23.829,A fucking blowjob.
00:19:25.455,00:19:27.958,You think the universe can make that happen?
00:19:43.390,00:19:45.225,Maybe I should call him tomorrow.
00:20:07.497,00:20:08.415,Hey.
00:20:10.918,00:20:12.544,"-Hey, man. Nikki. -What's up, man? Vince."
00:20:12.628,00:20:13.503,Come in.
00:20:14.755,00:20:16.924,"-Hey! What's up, Vince? -All right!"
00:20:17.007,00:20:18.091,"-How are you? -Yeah, man."
00:20:18.175,00:20:19.885,"-This is Mick Mars. -What's up, man?"
00:20:22.471,00:20:25.140,And we got you some lyrics. This is Live Wire.
00:20:34.107,00:20:36.944,I'm just trying to make sure these guys are good enough to play with you.
00:21:04.471,00:21:05.514,All right. Stop.
00:21:06.974,00:21:07.975,"Sorry, what?"
00:21:08.100,00:21:09.977,"This music's way too heavy, baby."
00:21:11.436,00:21:12.437,Thank you.
00:21:12.729,00:21:16.900,"Why don't we just tune it all down a whole step so that he can-- Let's play it faster, too."
00:21:23.865,00:21:25.534,"-Okay. -Hit this note, right here."
00:21:25.784,00:21:28.620,"-And muzzle that. -Hey, fuck you, asshole!"
00:21:28.704,00:22:37.522,"He doesn't tell me what to do, Burn, fuckers!"
00:22:40.567,00:22:42.277,"So here's my theory, okay?"
00:22:42.778,00:22:46.365,"If we want to knock people on their asses, then we've gotta give them a show."
00:22:46.448,00:22:50.744,"The punks, they're doing the minimalist thing, so let's take it in the exact opposite direction."
00:22:50.827,00:22:54.289,"I'm talking a stadium show in the clubs, man."
00:22:54.373,00:22:58.794,"Like, costumes and lights and-- -Pyro. Flames and shit. -Exactly."
00:22:58.877,00:23:00.504,-Explosions. -Exactly.
00:23:00.587,00:23:07.594,"Look, it's a fucking war out there, and the only way we win is by showing these kids something they've never seen before."
00:23:08.387,00:23:10.972,-So what do we call this thing? -Where is it? Here.
00:23:11.390,00:23:14.518,"You know, it's all about being, like, fucking larger than life."
00:23:19.147,00:23:20.607,Xmass?
00:23:20.857,00:23:21.691,Yeah.
00:23:21.858,00:23:25.487,"On a scale of one to ten, that gets a 1.9."
00:23:28.490,00:23:31.660,It's a play on Christmas. You can use all the Christ imagery and shit.
00:23:31.743,00:23:34.413,"It'll piss people off and make people think, you know."
00:23:36.289,00:23:37.582,It's got shock value.
00:23:39.042,00:23:41.044,I'm shocked by how much it blows.
00:23:44.005,00:23:46.466,"You give it a shot, but fucking make it big!"
00:23:48.051,00:23:49.845,"Here. Use my pen, Tommy."
00:24:06.695,00:24:08.447,"The Fourskins? Really, Tommy?"
00:24:08.530,00:24:11.408,Yeah. 'Cause we're gonna fuck the audience in the face every night.
00:24:11.992,00:24:15.620,"Yeah, but can you see that shit on the marquee above the Forum?"
00:24:15.704,00:24:17.664,"Okay, you're right. I'm out."
00:24:19.207,00:24:21.376,"Come on, Mick. You've gotta do better than that."
00:24:26.965,00:24:29.259,I've been waiting a long time for this day.
00:24:31.803,00:24:32.762,All right.
00:24:51.823,00:24:53.366,"That's sick, dude!"
00:25:08.340,00:25:10.425,"Yeah! That's gnarly, dude."
00:25:12.093,00:25:16.097,"Man, my girlfriend spent, like, 800 bucks on these leather pants."
00:25:17.974,00:25:19.017,You like 'em?
00:25:19.351,00:25:20.519,"They're cool, bro."
00:25:20.602,00:25:23.230,"-You say everything's cool, Drummer. -Thanks, man."
00:25:30.028,00:25:32.322,So you think there's gonna be anybody out there tonight?
00:25:44.584,00:25:46.753,All right!
00:25:46.836,00:25:49.381,We're Mötley Crüe!
00:25:51.383,00:25:52.384,Fuck!
00:25:54.094,00:25:55.220,Come on.
00:26:00.141,00:26:02.644,"Come on, boys. Let's rock this hole!"
00:26:13.697,00:26:14.906,"Fuck you, asshole."
00:26:23.331,00:26:25.875,Our first show and it's gonna go like this?
00:26:27.168,00:26:28.128,Dude. Hey!
00:27:01.244,00:27:06.583,"Fuck, yeah! Mötley Crüe!"
00:27:07.292,00:27:09.002,Whooooooo!
00:28:56.401,00:28:58.361,"And how about we repeat that, like, here."
00:28:58.445,00:29:00.155,Yeah. And then we do that fucking shit.
00:29:10.165,00:29:12.751,Hey. Tom Zutaut. Elektra Records. How are you?
00:29:13.126,00:29:14.169,Back of the line.
00:29:14.502,00:29:15.837,"Oh! No, no, no."
00:29:15.920,00:29:17.505,I'm serious. I just got promoted.
00:29:17.589,00:29:22.302,"I haven't actually signed any bands yet, but-- -Back of the line! -All right. Seriously. Jeez, man!"
00:29:47.327,00:29:48.995,What the fuck?!
00:29:49.078,00:29:52.832,-You bitch! -Babe-- Fuck you! Piece of shit!
00:29:52.916,00:29:54.375,-Babe! -Motherfucker!
00:29:55.627,00:29:56.961,Fuck! My pants! Babe!
00:29:57.045,00:29:58.087,Fuck you!
00:30:02.217,00:30:04.135,I fucking love those pants.
00:30:51.808,00:30:54.269,"Do you wanna join? She's like, I got a boyfriend."
00:30:55.144,00:30:57.814,"Hey, guys. I'm Tom Zutaut. I work for Elektra Records."
00:30:57.897,00:30:59.440,"-Nice to meet you, bro. -Hey, man."
00:30:59.524,00:31:01.985,I'd love the opportunity to talk with you if you have a second.
00:31:02.068,00:31:03.945,-Wanna sit down? -That's really cool.
00:31:04.028,00:31:05.738,-Sit. Do it. -Thank you.
00:31:06.030,00:31:07.699,"-Scoot over. -Yes, absolutely."
00:31:08.992,00:31:20.378,"Listen, I've been seeing what you guys have been doing in LA, and I think, with my help, I think I could really do something for you-- Oh, my God!"
00:31:23.423,00:31:24.424,Not for you?
00:31:26.092,00:31:27.176,"No, thank you."
00:31:27.260,00:31:28.136,Okay.
00:31:29.387,00:31:33.391,"Anyway, let's get back to, you know, what I was talking about."
00:31:33.975,00:31:36.561,"So, what do you guys say? Do you want a record deal?"
00:31:37.228,00:31:38.438,Uh...
00:31:43.401,00:31:44.569,Is that a yes?
00:31:44.652,00:31:47.572,I don't know if we can trust a dude who turns down a free blowjob.
00:31:47.655,00:31:49.115,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:31:52.869,00:31:54.829,"Tommy, vacuum this mess up."
00:31:57.540,00:32:00.793,which meant better drugs and bigger parties.
00:32:00.877,00:32:03.004,"We were the kings. I mean, look at this place!"
00:32:03.087,00:32:05.089,Everybody wanted to party with us.
00:32:05.173,00:32:06.758,"Can I get a fucking line, man?"
00:32:06.841,00:32:09.052,"Yeah, right, man. Get the fuck out of here."
00:32:11.012,00:32:12.931,right there on our fucking couch!
00:32:16.392,00:32:18.186,"Whoa! What the fuck, dude?!"
00:32:18.519,00:32:20.855,"Chill out, asshole. It's cool."
00:32:20.939,00:32:23.483,Cool? That is David Lee Roth.
00:32:23.566,00:32:26.069,How about you show a little respect or get the fuck out?
00:32:26.152,00:32:27.904,"Make me, motherfucker."
00:32:33.993,00:32:35.912,You fellas are gonna need a manager.
00:32:37.246,00:32:38.122,"Hey, Dave."
00:32:43.378,00:32:45.171,This didn't actually happen.
00:32:45.797,00:32:48.091,Doc never came to this filthy shithole.
00:32:48.174,00:32:51.427,We met him at the Santa Monica Civic Center after a show.
00:32:51.511,00:32:54.138,"He also brought his partner, Doug Thaler."
00:32:54.722,00:33:01.938,"Doug's a good guy, and it's kinda shitty he got cut from this movie, but I think this is as good a version as any."
00:33:02.188,00:33:03.022,So...
00:33:03.940,00:33:05.358,on with the goddamn show.
00:33:06.067,00:33:07.944,"Oh, good. You met Doc."
00:33:08.027,00:33:10.154,"He works with James Brown, Kiss, you name it."
00:33:10.238,00:33:11.572,Fucking hate Kiss.
00:33:11.656,00:33:18.871,"Well, I make them a shitload of money, and I take care of everything they need, -which is what I'm gonna do for you. -Oh, yeah? And how are you gonna do that?"
00:33:19.539,00:33:21.082,"Look, I know what I see up there."
00:33:21.416,00:33:26.379,"Anyone can start a band and crap out a song or two, but not many have the vision to go the distance."
00:33:26.462,00:33:29.966,And you guys need someone to guide you through the fucking wilderness.
00:33:31.259,00:33:33.219,And you're gonna be that someone?
00:33:33.302,00:33:34.929,You're goddamn right I am.
00:33:40.435,00:33:41.352,All right.
00:33:45.064,00:33:51.154,"We'd conquered the Sunset Strip, and it was time for America to meet Mötley Crüe."
00:33:52.030,00:33:53.322,We're gonna fucking die!
00:33:58.244,00:34:02.957,"Boys, on behalf of Elektra Records, I just wanna wish you good luck tonight."
00:34:03.791,00:34:04.709,Where's Vince?
00:34:04.792,00:34:06.919,Just saw him in the dressing room getting ready.
00:34:07.211,00:34:11.466,"This is your first big show, and there's 18,000 people out there tonight, so..."
00:34:12.508,00:34:13.551,please don't fuck this up.
00:34:13.843,00:34:14.719,"Thanks, Tom."
00:34:15.344,00:34:17.346,"Hey, let's go find Vince. Come on."
00:34:19.182,00:34:20.433,Fuck all that.
00:34:21.559,00:34:23.644,You guys just do what you do.
00:34:24.979,00:34:26.022,Fuck!
00:34:30.151,00:34:33.946,Have you seen my date? She's a brunette. She's wearing a leopard-skin bikini top.
00:34:34.030,00:34:36.616,"You've gotta find her 'cause if she misses the show, she'll kill me."
00:34:38.951,00:34:39.911,Vince!
00:34:41.746,00:34:42.872,"Hey, Vince."
00:34:43.998,00:34:46.709,"Got a shitload of babes waiting out here for you, bud."
00:34:47.752,00:34:48.669,Vince!
00:34:49.378,00:34:50.505,Coming!
00:34:56.219,00:34:57.303,Just hurry up.
00:35:04.602,00:35:10.733,You do realize we just signed a record deal with his company and that fucking his girlfriend could seriously fuck that up?
00:35:10.817,00:35:12.360,"Only if he finds out, man."
00:35:16.072,00:35:19.450,"I found out many years later, and it hurt really bad."
00:35:20.159,00:35:24.580,"Bottom line is, don't ever leave your girlfriend alone with Mötley Crüe, ever!"
00:35:25.289,00:35:26.541,Because they'll fuck her!
00:35:28.876,00:35:31.045,"Seriously, we're gonna die."
00:35:31.337,00:35:33.256,"-I'm okay. -Right, listen up."
00:35:33.339,00:35:34.882,"Come on, gather round, guys."
00:35:35.466,00:35:36.384,Look where we are.
00:35:36.717,00:35:41.222,"We've got an old man, a kid drummer, a cover band singer and a fucking runaway."
00:35:41.764,00:35:44.767,"No one would have thought we'd make it here, so fuck them."
00:35:45.184,00:35:47.812,"Win it all or lose it all, we're Mötley fuckin' Crüe."
00:36:11.878,00:36:14.714,Title track from our up-and-coming album.
00:36:14.964,00:36:19.010,We call it Shout at the Devil.
00:37:36.170,00:37:43.469,"Mötley Crüe, no strangers to controversy, are under fire once again for their latest Satanic song, Shout at the Devil."
00:37:43.552,00:37:48.683,"The group brushed off the accusations, claiming it's shout at the devil, not with the devil."
00:37:49.100,00:37:55.314,"Parents, be warned, the group continues to play the song on tour with the Prince of Darkness himself, Ozzy Osbourne."
00:38:12.415,00:38:14.750,How many chicks have you fucked so far?
00:38:15.626,00:38:18.170,"-Three. -No, not today, on the tour."
00:38:18.254,00:38:19.463,"Oh, man!"
00:38:25.386,00:38:26.470,That was fun.
00:38:27.596,00:38:28.973,"What about you, old man?"
00:38:29.432,00:38:34.979,Did you ever stop to think that the slobs who fuck you guys probably fuck every other band who comes through town?
00:38:42.862,00:38:45.781,"Dude, we're like pussy brothers with the whole scene."
00:38:47.950,00:38:54.332,"I happen to have respect for myself and the females of our species, unlike you animals."
00:38:54.915,00:38:57.084,"Let's have some fucking fun, huh?"
00:39:00.588,00:39:01.714,"Well, drinks are on me."
00:39:04.759,00:39:05.593,Come on!
00:39:06.135,00:39:08.054,It's like a piggy bank in there.
00:39:08.804,00:39:11.057,"All right, I'll just leave it there for you."
00:39:12.099,00:39:13.476,Drinks are on me!
00:39:25.780,00:39:28.741,"All these years, and you're still keeping up with us kids."
00:39:29.241,00:39:30.576,Keeping up with them?
00:39:30.659,00:39:32.536,"I've fucking lapped you, mate."
00:39:33.704,00:39:36.248,Now come here and have a talk with your Uncle Oz.
00:39:36.415,00:39:37.750,Come on. Come on.
00:39:42.338,00:39:44.423,"Now, this is your first real tour, right?"
00:39:44.799,00:39:46.384,I want you to be careful.
00:39:46.967,00:39:50.429,"Have fun, but know when to say when."
00:39:51.806,00:39:57.561,"'Cause a life full of booze, drugs, and unprotected sex is only gonna fuck you up, man."
00:39:58.270,00:40:02.691,"I mean, you take it too far, and you'll go fucking mad!"
00:40:10.366,00:40:12.535,And give me a straw. I fancy a bump.
00:40:12.618,00:40:14.703,"-Oh, man. -All right, we're all out of blow, dude."
00:40:14.787,00:40:16.664,"-Man, we're out. -I said I want a bump."
00:40:17.123,00:40:18.165,"Straw, please."
00:40:20.835,00:40:21.961,Okay.
00:40:26.590,00:40:27.967,"Oh, fuck!"
00:40:32.012,00:40:33.639,"You think you're ready for that, man?"
00:40:34.557,00:40:35.391,Do ya?
00:40:37.852,00:40:39.311,Do you think you're ready for that?
00:40:51.323,00:40:53.117,Everybody else has a drink.
00:40:55.703,00:40:57.079,No!
00:41:04.378,00:41:05.421,Crazy fucker.
00:41:24.356,00:41:30.070,"I had managed the Scorpions, Bon Jovi, Skid Row, Kiss."
00:41:33.032,00:41:35.159,with all kinds of mentally ill people.
00:41:46.795,00:41:48.672,what Mötley Crüe put me through.
00:42:24.959,00:42:27.545,and were making more money than they'd ever imagined.
00:42:27.836,00:42:29.380,And they spent it even faster.
00:42:36.679,00:42:38.055,What did you idiots do now?
00:42:55.614,00:42:59.827,They weren't like other bands who raised hell because they thought that's what rock stars were supposed to do.
00:43:06.917,00:43:08.043,What happened?
00:43:08.127,00:43:10.170,"It slipped, man. Right through."
00:43:10.254,00:43:11.422,What the fuck?!
00:43:13.048,00:43:14.049,Shit!
00:43:44.955,00:43:45.789,Come here.
00:43:46.290,00:43:48.417,Come here. Come here.
00:43:49.251,00:43:50.252,What's your name?
00:43:51.086,00:43:52.963,"Buy a dance and I'll tell you, rock star."
00:43:53.047,00:43:54.214,You're on.
00:44:06.727,00:44:07.603,Mötley Crüe!
00:44:08.145,00:44:08.979,You all all right?
00:44:10.439,00:44:12.566,Razzle. Hanoi Rocks.
00:44:12.650,00:44:13.692,"What's up, man?"
00:44:13.776,00:44:15.694,"We're touring the States for the first time, mate."
00:44:20.240,00:44:21.408,Fucking hell!
00:44:29.875,00:44:33.545,I fucking love America!
00:44:44.515,00:44:46.600,Hi! What are you doing here?
00:44:46.684,00:44:49.436,"I told you, you don't need to work here anymore. You're my girl."
00:44:50.104,00:44:51.522,I've still gotta pay rent.
00:44:51.605,00:44:53.482,"Not if you move in with me, you don't."
00:45:03.992,00:45:05.160,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:18.632,00:45:20.175,Ohhh! Whoo!
00:45:21.135,00:45:22.261,"Hey, Sixx."
00:45:22.928,00:45:24.304,Tommy's looking for you.
00:45:30.310,00:45:32.396,He wants to introduce you to his parents.
00:45:32.813,00:45:34.898,I see you've already met his girlfriend.
00:45:37.776,00:45:40.070,Check this out. Pyro coming out of those.
00:45:40.320,00:45:41.280,Oh!
00:45:47.995,00:45:49.329,"Ooh, Ma, Dad."
00:45:49.705,00:45:51.290,Meet the Sixxter.
00:45:52.249,00:45:54.418,So nice to finally meet you.
00:45:57.463,00:45:58.630,It's a pleasure.
00:45:58.714,00:46:01.133,"Hey, Nikki, we could fly your family out for the next LA gig."
00:46:01.300,00:46:02.885,"Yeah, that's a great idea, Doc."
00:46:02.968,00:46:04.595,"Oh, guys, I want you to meet somebody else."
00:46:04.678,00:46:06.180,"Babe, come here."
00:46:07.723,00:46:08.932,"Mom, Dad."
00:46:09.808,00:46:11.852,"This is Roxie, my fiancée."
00:46:14.188,00:46:16.148,-Nice to meet you. -We're getting married.
00:46:18.066,00:46:21.195,"What's the rush, Tom? Marriage is a big decision."
00:46:21.278,00:46:22.112,Exactly.
00:46:22.446,00:46:26.700,"You proposed to Mom the night that you guys met, and she didn't even speak English. That's love, dude."
00:46:26.784,00:46:29.369,"That's what I've always wanted, and now that's what I've got."
00:46:30.788,00:46:33.665,"So, how did you and Tommy meet?"
00:46:33.957,00:46:40.172,"Well, I was actually hanging out with this other band, but then I met Tommy, and it was..."
00:46:40.756,00:46:42.007,totally meant to be.
00:46:42.090,00:46:43.967,"Oh, I know this word."
00:46:46.053,00:46:48.347,"Groupie, right? Is that how they call you?"
00:46:54.895,00:46:55.729,Babe...
00:46:56.605,00:46:57.606,Mom.
00:46:57.689,00:46:58.816,That's not cool.
00:46:58.899,00:47:02.361,"I don't understand. You say this all the time, like it's the best thing in the world."
00:47:15.499,00:47:19.461,"I keep having this vision, right, where my drum set, it rises up like this..."
00:47:20.045,00:47:27.177,"And then bam! Smoke, lights, and the whole thing starts spinning around, and I'm playing drums upside down and..."
00:47:27.261,00:47:29.930,"I should just draw it for you. Hey, Rox, you got a pen? Give me a pen."
00:47:30.722,00:47:33.600,"But, like, a cage or something. I don't know."
00:47:33.684,00:47:35.143,Your mom's a cunt.
00:47:35.394,00:47:37.437,What? Why would you say that?
00:47:37.896,00:47:40.524,Because she is. She's a cunt.
00:47:40.858,00:47:42.901,"Quit it. Give me the pen, all right?"
00:47:43.777,00:47:45.362,I don't even know why you told them.
00:47:45.445,00:47:50.242,It's not like she has anything to do with us getting married.
00:47:50.450,00:47:54.037,"Baby, it's sweet, all right? It's tradition."
00:47:54.121,00:47:56.582,Which tradition? The mandatory meeting of the cunt!
00:47:56.665,00:47:58.917,"Don't call her that again, you hear me?"
00:48:01.670,00:48:04.923,-Here's your pen! -Ow! What the fuck is wrong with you?
00:48:05.716,00:48:08.135,Fuck you and fuck your mother!
00:48:08.218,00:48:10.846,That's it. This fucking bitch is out of here. Pull over!
00:48:10.929,00:48:13.473,Get the fuck off my bus! Get the fuck out!
00:48:15.934,00:48:20.856,You are such a spoiled little mama's boy 'cause you wanna crawl back inside her cunt!
00:48:30.782,00:48:32.159,I told you not to say that.
00:48:33.118,00:48:34.202,Fuck!
00:49:01.688,00:49:03.440,Hello! Welcome.
00:49:03.523,00:49:05.859,Drinks. One for you and you.
00:49:07.653,00:49:08.820,Goddamn.
00:49:09.780,00:49:11.531,"-You okay there, Mick? -Yeah."
00:49:12.366,00:49:15.077,My back hurts from carrying this band all tour.
00:49:15.160,00:49:17.287,-Right. -Don't you love this guy?
00:49:34.805,00:49:35.973,"Hey, babe, this is Grace."
00:49:38.141,00:49:40.185,Do you wanna have a threesome?
00:49:44.314,00:49:45.983,"She's fucking pregnant, man."
00:49:46.566,00:49:47.859,That's fucked up.
00:49:49.736,00:49:53.031,"Nah, I'm just fucking with you. I'm just fucking with you, man."
00:49:53.991,00:49:56.618,"But don't be a fucking dick, okay?"
00:49:56.868,00:49:59.913,"-Look at her, she's fucking pregnant. -Don't be a fucking dick, Zutaut."
00:49:59.997,00:50:01.123,All right. I'm sorry.
00:50:03.458,00:50:06.169,"Need to get some more booze, babe. I'm gonna be right back."
00:50:06.253,00:50:07.963,"We have enough booze, jeez!"
00:50:08.672,00:50:11.174,"-Be right back. -Oh! Babe, feel."
00:50:11.508,00:50:12.592,The baby's kicking.
00:50:13.510,00:50:14.511,Do you feel it?
00:50:18.515,00:50:20.267,"Just hurry back, okay?"
00:50:20.434,00:50:21.935,"Raz, are you coming?"
00:50:22.019,00:50:23.854,"Twice already today, mate."
00:50:25.355,00:50:27.607,"-Sorry about that, love. -Mm-hmm."
00:50:27.691,00:50:29.818,Or should I say loves?
00:50:30.193,00:50:31.403,"Loves, yeah."
00:50:32.738,00:50:33.655,All right.
00:50:47.919,00:50:48.920,Wow!
00:50:57.679,00:50:58.764,Hey!
00:51:00.932,00:51:01.850,Dude!
00:51:03.018,00:51:04.311,Are you talking to me?
00:51:04.394,00:51:05.937,"Uh, Tommy."
00:51:06.980,00:51:07.856,Heather.
00:51:08.857,00:51:09.691,Oh.
00:51:10.525,00:51:12.027,I know. I know you from TV.
00:51:12.277,00:51:14.571,Yeah. I get that a lot.
00:51:14.654,00:51:16.114,Yeah. The Fall Guy. I love that show.
00:51:17.365,00:51:18.241,That's not me.
00:51:19.826,00:51:21.411,The Fall Guy is Heather Thomas.
00:51:22.496,00:51:23.580,I'm Heather Locklear.
00:51:29.127,00:51:30.670,I know you from MTV.
00:51:33.632,00:51:35.509,"Yeah, well, I get that a lot."
00:51:36.843,00:51:38.804,Whitesnake. Right?
00:51:39.137,00:51:41.348,"Fuck, you're mean."
00:51:42.849,00:51:44.059,And I think I love you.
00:51:48.188,00:51:49.064,Yep.
00:51:56.071,00:51:57.489,"All right, stop stalling."
00:51:57.572,00:52:00.784,"Who would you rather fuck, Cyndi Lauper or Boy George?"
00:52:00.867,00:52:03.120,"-How about neither? -Nah, man. You've gotta pick one."
00:52:03.203,00:52:06.039,You've got a gun to your head. Fuck one or die. Which one is it gonna be?
00:52:06.123,00:52:09.126,"No, you know what? I'm having trouble accepting this premise."
00:52:09.209,00:52:12.754,Under what circumstances would I find myself in such a situation?
00:52:12.838,00:52:15.423,"-It's a mystery, you cockney fuck. -It's a mystery."
00:52:15.507,00:52:21.221,"You know, some random fucker's trapped the three of you in a room, and he's demanding you fuck one of them."
00:52:21.304,00:52:25.851,What does this mysterious person benefit from my sexual humiliation?
00:52:26.351,00:52:30.522,"I don't know, man, but you're definitely gonna die if you don't fucking pick."
00:52:33.650,00:52:37.237,"In that case, I think I'd have to go with the Lauper."
00:52:37.320,00:52:39.698,At least she's got the proper plumbing.
00:52:41.241,00:52:45.871,"Hey, no, but Georgie boy, he's probably more experienced in the handling of penis."
00:53:12.606,00:53:13.523,Jesus.
00:53:15.901,00:53:17.986,"That was a fucking close one, man."
00:53:23.325,00:53:24.242,But...
00:53:25.410,00:53:26.494,where are we?
00:53:28.288,00:53:29.414,It's Christmas.
00:53:32.709,00:53:34.044,Look at all the lights.
00:53:35.212,00:53:36.963,"What the fuck are you talking about, man?"
00:53:46.848,00:53:48.016,"Oh, yeah."
00:53:48.767,00:53:50.143,"Look at the lights, man."
00:53:52.145,00:53:54.022,"What do you want for Christmas, Raz?"
00:53:58.777,00:54:00.028,"Wake up, man."
00:54:01.738,00:54:03.865,"Raz, wake up. Hey."
00:54:06.826,00:54:07.994,"Wake up, man."
00:54:08.078,00:54:09.829,My buddy fell asleep. Hey.
00:54:10.372,00:54:11.373,"Wake up, man."
00:54:22.634,00:54:24.636,"Razzle! Come on, man, wake up!"
00:54:32.894,00:54:35.605,The people in the other car were both critically injured.
00:54:37.315,00:54:40.944,Vince was arrested for drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter.
00:54:43.363,00:54:45.657,He was sentenced to 30 days in jail.
00:54:48.493,00:54:51.913,But only served 19 on the condition that he stay sober.
00:54:58.128,00:55:03.383,and some wonder if the consequences are harsh enough for the singer whose actions resulted in tragedy.
00:55:08.471,00:55:11.057,And I didn't call. I didn't visit.
00:55:11.641,00:55:14.311,I didn't support him in any way whatsoever.
00:55:16.062,00:55:17.439,Why wasn't I there for him?
00:55:18.648,00:55:19.858,It was simple.
00:55:21.067,00:55:23.528,I'd fallen head over heels in love.
00:55:24.779,00:55:27.032,And she was the sweetest thing I'd ever known.
00:55:28.658,00:55:32.704,She made me feel all the warmth and happiness I never knew as a child.
00:55:36.541,00:55:38.126,Her name was heroin.
00:56:18.166,00:56:20.001,"Hey, what's taking so long?"
00:56:20.168,00:56:21.920,"Vince got out of jail, like, three months ago."
00:56:22.003,00:56:23.296,They should be on tour by now.
00:56:23.380,00:56:26.257,Are you out of your fucking mind? Look at 'em.
00:56:36.976,00:56:38.311,"Look, man, my boss is killing me."
00:56:38.395,00:56:41.398,We need to get them to finish that record and get back on the road.
00:56:43.274,00:56:48.738,"I'll get 'em on tour, but you guys, you think you own them because you own their music, right?"
00:56:49.864,00:56:54.828,"Well, then, it's on you and your fucking label if one of those idiots comes back in a body bag."
00:56:56.663,00:56:57.497,Just...
00:56:58.039,00:57:00.375,Just... get them back on the road. All right?
00:57:49.382,00:57:51.759,"I got, um, the lyrics."
00:57:52.177,00:57:54.554,"I made a couple of adjustments, but..."
00:57:55.513,00:57:56.514,I think you may like 'em.
00:57:56.848,00:57:58.016,Home Sweet Home?
00:57:58.600,00:58:00.018,"It's been too long, buddy."
00:58:01.978,00:58:03.271,Have a bump with me.
00:58:03.688,00:58:05.773,I just got out of fucking jail.
00:58:17.827,00:58:19.162,Wanna show him the melody?
00:58:35.220,00:58:37.472,-What the fuck was that? -That was smack.
00:58:40.975,00:58:43.728,"You guys slip me smack, and I'm the fucking problem?"
00:58:48.024,00:58:52.070,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm a monster. I killed Razzle, yeah."
00:58:53.404,00:58:55.323,Could have happened to any one of you!
00:59:04.374,00:59:07.752,is that I thought it was Vince who was fucking up the band.
00:59:18.179,00:59:19.180,Frankie...
00:59:20.139,00:59:21.140,this is your mom.
00:59:22.016,00:59:29.941,"Look, I know that you're busy, yeah, I'd just really like to talk to you sometime."
00:59:30.567,00:59:32.819,Call me back. Okay?
00:59:40.034,00:59:43.288,"'cause this is very selfish, what you're doing."
00:59:46.749,00:59:48.543,I just miss you...
00:59:49.252,00:59:50.378,Frankie.

00:59:56.801,00:59:58.177,"Damn it, Frankie."
01:00:03.641,01:00:05.935,Baby! Come here.
01:00:08.605,01:00:10.023,"-You have a little-- -No, leave it."
01:00:10.106,01:00:11.482,It'll remind me of you.
01:00:12.650,01:00:15.570,"Okay. Just take it off before dinner with Daddy tonight, okay?"
01:00:16.029,01:00:16.863,Yeah.

01:00:27.999,01:00:29.834,Is that one gonna be a problem?
01:00:29.917,01:00:31.169,What? She's great.
01:00:32.086,01:00:34.130,-You're lucky she's hot. -I know.
01:00:34.547,01:00:35.882,"She's super hot, right?"
01:00:39.344,01:00:40.762,"I think I'm in love, Mick."
01:00:43.723,01:00:44.766,"Hey, man."
01:00:48.436,01:00:51.648,"Oh, Skylar, is it time to go already?"
01:00:59.113,01:00:59.989,Mommy!
01:01:00.531,01:01:01.991,"-Come on, we're leaving. -Mommy!"
01:01:07.705,01:01:08.665,"Bye, Vince."
01:01:09.290,01:01:11.042,"-I know, baby. -Bye, Sharise."
01:01:20.510,01:01:23.096,Is this bring your fucking girlfriend to work day?
01:01:23.638,01:01:25.181,Wish I had a girlfriend.
01:01:25.723,01:01:27.058,"I know, Mick. I know."
01:01:27.433,01:01:29.227,"Well, at least the album's great."
01:01:30.269,01:01:33.064,"-The album blows, Doc. -What are you talking about?"
01:01:33.773,01:01:36.067,Smokin' in the Boys Room is gonna be huge.
01:01:37.485,01:01:38.736,Come on!
01:01:38.820,01:01:40.613,Home Sweet Home. Everyone knows that's a hit.

01:01:42.615,01:01:45.159,"The rest is pure shit. Believe me, I know."
01:01:45.243,01:01:48.746,I'm gonna be the only one sober up there every night trying to sell it.
01:01:49.539,01:01:51.082,"Well, I believe in you guys."
01:01:52.542,01:01:53.376,Look.
01:01:57.296,01:02:00.591,"You know Nikki changed the title to Theatre of Pain last night, right?"
01:02:00.675,01:02:02.802,Of course he did.
01:02:06.764,01:02:07.724,"Go get some rest, buddy."
01:02:13.104,01:02:14.355,Fuck me.
01:02:20.486,01:02:21.654,Theatre of Pain.

01:02:37.253,01:02:38.212,Heather and me.
01:02:39.589,01:02:43.926,"We're making it official, and I officially wanna make you my best man."
01:02:44.802,01:02:46.012,"You're my brother, dude."
01:02:46.846,01:02:50.475,"Okay, she's gonna be my wife, and I can't imagine being up there without you, bro."
01:02:52.435,01:02:53.436,Will you do it?
01:02:54.353,01:02:55.313,Do what?

01:03:07.700,01:03:10.286,"Are we gonna rock Denver tonight or what, T-bone?"
01:03:15.166,01:03:17.502,"Of course, he doesn't know where we're going! I mean, dude..."
01:03:18.044,01:03:19.796,how the fuck can you keep track?
01:03:22.465,01:03:24.759,You wanna know what life on the road's really like?
01:03:25.426,01:03:28.179,"For me, every day went something like this..."
01:03:32.266,01:03:33.684,"Aw, fuck!"
01:03:46.113,01:03:47.240,Seven-thirty p.m.

01:03:54.705,01:03:55.706,Argh!
01:03:58.709,01:04:00.711,Do you remember pissing on that cop car last night?
01:04:01.087,01:04:02.338,"Uh, no."
01:04:04.507,01:04:06.676,Nine-thirty p.m. Show time.
01:04:06.759,01:04:08.386,Adrenaline kicks in.

01:04:30.116,01:04:32.785,Make sure to call fiancée before the real party starts.
01:04:32.869,01:04:34.328,Try your best to sound sober.
01:04:35.705,01:04:38.374,-The show was fucking crazy. -It was?
01:04:38.958,01:04:40.042,I miss you.
01:04:42.962,01:04:44.964,-Babe? -I'm in Massachusetts.
01:04:45.047,01:04:53.973,"-Babe, I'm gonna call you right back. -Wait-- The stewardess serves up some drugs and drinks."
01:04:54.473,01:04:55.308,Thank you.
01:04:58.436,01:05:00.229,"For Mick, vodka."
01:05:00.313,01:05:06.611,"For Nikki and me, zombie dust, which keeps the body awake and shuts the brain off, man."
01:05:06.903,01:05:07.945,Four a.m.
01:05:08.029,01:05:10.615,"Arrive in new city, go straight to the nearest strip club."
01:05:12.617,01:05:14.994,"Drink, snort and fuck everything in sight."
01:05:20.291,01:05:21.250,I'm so sorry.
01:05:23.502,01:05:24.670,"Hey, Vinnie!"
01:05:35.681,01:05:37.266,"Goddamn, I love strippers."
01:05:43.147,01:05:44.732,So sorry. I am so sorry.
01:05:50.863,01:05:52.031,"Hey, your food is ready!"
01:05:52.365,01:05:53.324,Fuck.
01:05:58.454,01:05:59.455,Time to redecorate.
01:06:05.628,01:06:08.339,"Yeah, move the TV over here."
01:06:10.091,01:06:12.301,-What is wrong with you? -Don't fucking come in here.
01:06:12.802,01:06:14.428,"-Stop it! -Fuck you, Doc."
01:06:24.105,01:06:25.648,Stupid fuck...
01:06:38.035,01:06:39.120,Remember nothing.
01:06:56.387,01:06:57.388,Clean yourself up.
01:06:57.805,01:06:58.889,You've got a visitor.
01:07:05.479,01:07:07.606,Your mother called and asked to come to a show.
01:07:07.690,01:07:10.276,"So, I thought with it being the holidays and all..."
01:07:14.071,01:07:15.781,"Merry Christmas, Frank."
01:07:16.157,01:07:17.366,That's not my name.
01:07:29.003,01:07:30.337,"Oh, that song."
01:07:32.006,01:07:34.383,The one about looks that kill.
01:07:38.637,01:07:40.347,"It's about me, isn't it, Frankie?"
01:07:51.275,01:07:52.109,Nikki!
01:07:52.818,01:07:54.320,"Wait up a minute, will ya?"
01:07:54.945,01:07:56.739,Who the fuck do you think you are?
01:07:57.239,01:07:58.407,I thought it would help.
01:07:58.491,01:08:03.037,"I fucking trusted you, but you are not my fucking father and you are not my fucking friend."
01:08:03.120,01:08:10.169,"You are just another leech with your hands in my pockets who wouldn't be standing there now unless you were getting something out of it, so just fuck off, Doc."
01:08:10.252,01:08:11.754,You're fucking fired!
01:09:13.274,01:09:14.984,"She's really gonna marry me, huh?"
01:09:16.277,01:09:17.987,"This isn't some kind of a sick joke, is it?"
01:09:22.241,01:09:24.201,What time is it? I think we should get out there.
01:09:24.285,01:09:25.202,"Nikki, let's hit it."
01:09:26.579,01:09:27.580,You guys ready?
01:09:29.123,01:09:31.917,"Yo, best man. Let's go. I got a wife waiting. Come on!"
01:09:33.878,01:09:35.045,You fucking kidding me?
01:09:35.754,01:09:37.923,"Hey, Nikki. Wake up, asshole."
01:09:38.549,01:09:39.884,"What the fuck, dude?"
01:09:39.967,01:09:40.926,Jesus!
01:09:41.427,01:09:42.344,I'm good.
01:09:43.220,01:09:44.138,It's all good.
01:09:44.221,01:09:48.434,"You're most definitely not all good, man. But, whatever, just clean-- Hey!"
01:09:48.726,01:09:51.812,"Get your shit together. I don't want Heather to be embarrassed, okay?"
01:09:55.357,01:09:56.192,Cool.
01:09:59.820,01:10:03.991,Let's go marry your fancy ass TV chick in this fancy ass hotel.
01:10:04.074,01:10:07.203,"Hey, are you gonna do this on the happiest day of my life, asshole?"
01:10:07.703,01:10:09.330,The happiest day of your life?
01:10:10.623,01:10:15.628,"Nah, the happiest day of your life was when I let you join my band."
01:10:18.422,01:10:21.008,Shall I get someone else to stand up there with me or what?
01:10:21.300,01:10:22.718,"Don't look at me, man."
01:10:23.886,01:10:25.179,"I'll do it, Drummer."
01:10:28.349,01:10:31.644,I've already got the fucking rings. Let's just go.
01:10:47.826,01:10:49.203,Shit!
01:10:49.662,01:10:51.038,"Come on, guys. Picture."
01:10:51.914,01:10:52.873,Big smiles.
01:10:54.917,01:10:56.085,"Nikki, come on, man."
01:11:05.344,01:11:08.138,I couldn't believe he was shooting up at my wedding.
01:11:10.557,01:11:16.146,"At the time, I thought it was just that he couldn't stand to see someone else be happy."
01:11:17.064,01:11:23.320,"So I took it personally, but I didn't know that the partying had turned into something else for him."
01:11:24.154,01:11:32.454,"If you've got a big hole in your heart, then I guess you need to fill it with something, and he was filling it with $1,000 a day in heroin."
01:11:37.251,01:11:40.671,"And the sad thing is, I think he liked it there."
01:11:41.588,01:11:42.548,Did I miss the party?
01:11:47.011,01:11:51.307,You look like a man in need of some sweet...
01:11:52.933,01:11:54.268,sweet Persian.
01:11:55.894,01:11:57.646,How is that Persian?
01:11:59.064,01:12:00.941,Is there even still a Persia?
01:12:02.609,01:12:03.694,There has to be.
01:12:04.194,01:12:06.030,It's where all the cats come from.
01:12:08.657,01:12:09.700,What cats?
01:12:11.869,01:12:12.703,Persian.
01:12:13.037,01:12:15.122,"The cross-eyed ones, like in Lady and the Tramp."
01:12:15.456,01:12:19.126,-Remember those evil fuckers? -They're Siamese cats.
01:12:19.668,01:12:22.546,You don't fuckin' know shit about Walt Disney.
01:12:24.923,01:12:31.388,He used to like to lay beneath glass tables and have hookers take a shit right on the glass.
01:12:31.680,01:12:34.058,What are you talking about? That never happened.
01:12:35.976,01:12:41.023,"Because I'm a fucking perv, and I've never even thought about anything as fucked up as that."
01:12:42.608,01:12:43.901,"Yeah, but you..."
01:12:44.777,01:12:45.903,You do it.
01:12:47.237,01:12:48.322,Goddamn.
01:12:50.366,01:12:51.200,Squeezing.
01:13:26.985,01:13:27.903,Nikki?
01:13:29.321,01:13:30.197,Hey.
01:13:30.781,01:13:31.740,Nikki.
01:13:32.574,01:13:33.409,Hey.
01:13:34.159,01:13:35.035,You okay?
01:13:35.452,01:13:37.413,"-What the fuck did you give him? -Fuck, dude."
01:13:37.496,01:13:39.331,"-Nikki? -Oh, shit!"
01:13:42.126,01:13:43.710,Wake up! Fuck!
01:13:44.002,01:13:46.171,Wake the fuck up! Party's over.
01:14:01.562,01:14:10.237,We've just received unconfirmed reports that Mötley Crüe bassist Nikki Sixx has died in Hollywood this evening of an apparent drug overdose.
01:14:10.320,01:14:11.155,What the fuck?
01:14:11.238,01:14:13.740,We'll continue to bring you details on this developing story.
01:14:14.450,01:14:17.035,"-What the fuck? -Daddy, are you okay?"
01:14:17.619,01:14:19.163,"Yeah, baby, I'm fine. Yeah."
01:14:26.003,01:14:27.045,I love you too.
01:14:29.256,01:14:31.049,Let's get you back to bed. Come on.
01:14:39.224,01:14:40.267,Fuck.
01:14:40.684,01:14:41.602,Fuck!
01:14:42.728,01:14:48.692,"All right. Time of death-- Nah. This is Nikki fucking Sixx, man. He's not about to die in my ambulance."
01:14:49.401,01:14:50.402,Come on.
01:14:51.778,01:14:54.114,-Come on. Fuck! -I've got nothing.
01:14:54.198,01:14:55.282,Nah-ah.
01:15:00.454,01:15:01.455,Ow!
01:15:02.664,01:15:03.624,Yo!
01:15:08.795,01:15:13.926,"I'm done with drugs, I'm done with being unhappy, and I'm done with letting everyone down."
01:15:15.886,01:15:17.888,"Hey, it's Nikki."
01:15:18.597,01:15:19.765,I'm not home...
01:15:21.642,01:15:22.726,...'cause I'm dead.
01:15:37.658,01:15:39.952,I had so many reasons to live.
01:15:41.370,01:15:42.913,I don't need the drugs.
01:15:44.414,01:15:45.541,Fuck the drugs.
01:15:46.458,01:15:47.834,It's time to get clean.
01:15:53.966,01:15:55.717,right before I shot up again.
01:16:42.764,01:16:45.225,So I did the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
01:16:46.435,01:16:48.437,I reached out and asked for help.
01:16:49.563,01:16:52.858,"I called the band, and they all agreed to get clean with me."
01:16:53.775,01:16:55.819,Mötley Crüe was going to rehab.
01:17:04.911,01:17:07.331,Feelings and crying and apologies.
01:17:07.581,01:17:10.584,"This is my second time. Trust me, it's a drag."
01:17:10.667,01:17:12.711,You don't wanna see any of that shit.
01:17:13.629,01:17:15.714,But at least it got us in the studio.
01:17:20.802,01:17:21.970,Yeah!
01:17:22.471,01:17:26.016,"So rad, dude. So fucking rad. It's like we never recorded before."
01:17:30.228,01:17:33.315,"I mean, I've been on something every day since I was, like, 11 years old."
01:17:34.149,01:17:38.070,"I didn't used to be able to feel anything, but now I can feel everything."
01:17:38.153,01:17:39.905,"Like, that is just painful."
01:17:42.449,01:17:43.950,"Let's go again, buddy."
01:17:44.034,01:17:45.577,"Just wasn't your best, okay?"
01:17:45.661,01:17:50.540,I'm just tired of singing the same thing ten times in a row when it was fucking fine the first time.
01:17:50.624,01:17:54.127,"Vince, this album is gonna be great, so let's just hang in there, buddy."
01:17:54.211,01:17:56.588,"Now you're sober, you're a perfectionist too. Is that it?"
01:17:56.963,01:17:57.798,Yep.
01:17:58.131,01:17:59.549,Roll the goddamn tape.
01:18:06.390,01:18:08.058,"He'll get it, dude. He'll get it."
01:18:12.646,01:18:13.647,Better.
01:18:20.237,01:18:21.113,"Go, Vinnie!"
01:18:26.910,01:18:28.203,I forget what happened.
01:18:28.537,01:18:29.579,It's all a blur.
01:18:29.663,01:18:32.874,"But with Dr. Feelgood, we got our first number one album."
01:18:38.296,01:18:42.092,to a billion people in a billion cities all over the world.
01:18:54.146,01:18:55.439,"Hey, is Heather around?"
01:18:58.066,01:18:59.901,Yeah. Yeah.
01:19:12.706,01:19:14.958,"No, thank you. Just some more waters."
01:19:15.542,01:19:16.501,This is great.
01:19:25.010,01:19:26.595,"-Hello? -Sharise, where's Skylar?"
01:19:26.678,01:19:29.264,Is she already in bed? Can I talk to her?
01:19:29.347,01:19:31.224,"No, it's three a.m. here."
01:19:32.851,01:19:34.311,"Tell her that I love her, then."
01:19:34.394,01:19:36.354,Call her tomorrow and tell her yourself.
01:19:38.482,01:19:41.651,They're keeping us on the road. Fifteen new days in Canada.
01:19:41.735,01:19:44.279,I haven't seen anything about any new dates.
01:19:44.362,01:19:45.530,"Check your itinerary, man."
01:19:45.614,01:19:50.494,"I would, but somebody doesn't think it's important to let the lead fucking singer know what the fuck is going on here."
01:19:53.789,01:19:55.373,"Hey, it's Tommy. Is she in?"
01:19:57.292,01:19:58.919,Just let her know I called again.
01:20:00.796,01:20:01.963,"Guys, I fucked up."
01:20:02.047,01:20:05.425,Heather's been all weird and distant and I drank.
01:20:05.509,01:20:07.969,"Well, a little. I had one shot and I'm sorry."
01:20:08.053,01:20:11.306,"I'm gonna have a fucking cocktail too. What are you gonna do about it, Nikki?"
01:20:11.389,01:20:13.391,Everybody falls off the wagon once in a while.
01:20:13.475,01:20:16.853,"Fuck you, man. Fuck off! Fuck the rest of this tour."
01:20:16.937,01:20:21.691,"It is the No Fucking Fun tour, and I am sick and tired of not having any fucking fun."
01:20:23.151,01:20:25.904,"-Hey, we're not done. -We fucking are, man."
01:20:27.405,01:20:28.323,"Oh, and by the way..."
01:20:29.324,01:20:30.742,Here's to your sober band.
01:20:34.704,01:20:36.623,"Get me that itinerary, bass player."
01:20:59.271,01:21:01.273,"Blah de blah, fucking blah."
01:22:00.790,01:22:03.752,"I'm telling you, guys, everything is fucking upside down and flip-flopping."
01:22:03.835,01:22:08.256,"And while we're waiting for our lead singer to get his head out of his ass, we're getting left in the dust, man."
01:22:09.090,01:22:18.433,"I'm just saying, bands replace their front men and it still works. Van Halen-- I know Van Halen fucking did it 'cause you say that every single time Vince misses a fucking rehearsal."
01:22:18.683,01:22:20.268,Well? Mick?
01:22:20.727,01:22:21.603,Shut it.
01:22:24.314,01:22:25.607,Where is this asshole?
01:22:26.149,01:22:30.654,"Every second that goes by, I feel another bone rotting from this fucking disease."
01:22:33.406,01:22:34.699,Call the prick again.
01:22:36.201,01:22:38.495,"The ultimate party band, Van Halen, right?"
01:22:38.578,01:22:42.749,"To all of a sudden being not only accepted, but, you know, also kind of acknowledged."
01:23:21.121,01:23:28.211,Maybe if we save that fill until the second chorus Someone wanna tell me what the fuck's going on here?
01:23:28.294,01:23:32.882,"Let's save us all some time, especially yours, Vince, as it's clearly more fucking valuable than ours!"
01:23:32.966,01:23:35.051,You'd better tell me what the fuck's going on.
01:23:35.135,01:23:40.140,"We're down here, and we're working, and we wanna be here, but we are tired of forcing you to be here with us."
01:23:40.223,01:23:42.142,Maybe I'd come in more if I liked the material.
01:23:42.517,01:23:47.147,Maybe you'd like the material if you were in the studio making it with us instead of staring at your fucking watch!
01:23:47.230,01:23:52.402,"Yeah, I'm staring at my watch because this album is fucking stupid!"
01:23:58.867,01:24:00.160,"You know what, fuck all y'all."
01:24:00.744,01:24:02.871,"You know, I am done. Fuck this. I quit."
01:24:02.954,01:24:04.497,"Good, 'cause you're fucking fired!"
01:24:04.581,01:24:06.041,"I quit already, dick."
01:24:17.093,01:24:20.013,but they promise it's the same ol' situation.
01:24:20.388,01:24:27.979,"In their first interview with new singer John Corabi, the Crüe gives us a glimpse inside all the sex, drugs and rock and roll."
01:24:28.646,01:24:31.858,So what can we expect in this new era without Vince Neil?
01:24:32.484,01:24:39.324,"Well, we had four ingredients, and we took one fourth out and we put a stronger fourth in."
01:24:42.494,01:24:44.329,"Better, faster, louder."
01:24:45.872,01:24:47.999,"It's not about then, you know."
01:24:48.708,01:24:50.126,You can't live in the past.
01:24:52.295,01:24:53.630,"Man, they suck without you."
01:25:06.684,01:25:07.519,Yep.
01:25:16.402,01:25:18.530,Vince... come here.
01:25:18.613,01:25:19.948,What the hell is going on?
01:25:24.869,01:25:25.703,-At first... -What?
01:25:25.787,01:25:27.747,...I thought it was a stomach ache and...
01:25:27.831,01:25:31.209,You know how she had the flu? I thought she had the flu again and...
01:25:32.502,01:25:35.547,"They thought it was appendicitis, and then they told me that..."
01:25:36.714,01:25:38.383,she has a tumor in her stomach.
01:25:39.926,01:25:41.010,And she...
01:25:42.220,01:25:43.054,She...
01:25:43.513,01:25:45.932,"-She has cancer. -Oh, my God."
01:25:59.696,01:26:02.448,"I don't like it here, Daddy. Make it go away."
01:26:02.532,01:26:03.950,"I know, sweetheart."
01:26:05.618,01:26:09.289,"You're just gonna be here just a little while longer, okay?"
01:26:09.581,01:26:10.665,But why?
01:26:15.170,01:26:19.424,"Well, you see, sweetheart, you have something growing in your tummy."
01:26:19.507,01:26:21.759,Like when Mommy had me growing in her tummy?
01:26:21.843,01:26:22.927,"No, honey."
01:26:23.845,01:26:24.888,It's more like...
01:26:26.431,01:26:27.724,It's more like a flower.
01:26:29.017,01:26:33.730,"You have a flower growing in your tummy, but it's a type of flower that's not supposed to be in there."
01:26:34.189,01:26:40.904,"And so the doctors, they're gonna make you sleep just a little bit while they do an operation."
01:26:41.571,01:26:45.408,"After the doctor takes the flower out, then I can go home?"
01:26:48.828,01:26:49.704,Yeah.
01:26:50.413,01:26:51.998,Yeah. Then you can go home.
01:27:18.566,01:27:19.817,You got something to say?
01:27:20.652,01:27:25.323,"Well, I just didn't think it would end this way, with some other dude singing your songs."
01:27:25.406,01:27:27.158,You mean Elektra's fucking songs?
01:27:28.910,01:27:31.788,"You're never gonna live up to this deal. You know that, right?"
01:27:34.332,01:27:38.294,Then how about you give us back the rights to our music and we'll call it even?
01:27:38.378,01:27:39.712,What are you even asking?
01:27:41.506,01:27:44.592,You want me to give you back your music instead of the money we owe you?
01:27:45.426,01:27:48.054,The Beatles don't even own the rights to their own fucking music.
01:27:48.263,01:27:51.224,"Well, The Beatles should own the rights to their own fucking music."
01:27:52.225,01:27:53.559,And so should Mötley Crüe.
01:28:10.451,01:28:14.455,"It's okay. Hey. It's okay. Daddy's right here, baby."
01:28:14.914,01:28:17.292,"Daddy, don't let them cut me again."
01:28:18.001,01:28:20.086,"I'm not gonna let them cut you, okay?"
01:28:21.879,01:28:24.340,We're gonna go home soon. Real soon.
01:29:02.920,01:29:05.173,"-Baby, what the fuck? -I want you out!"
01:29:06.049,01:29:09.761,"Have a great life with your porno slut, you asshole!"
01:29:09.844,01:29:12.472,"Baby, I-- -Don't. -Baby!"
01:29:16.809,01:29:20.229,"Tommy, you fucking idiot! Fuck!"
01:29:24.609,01:29:25.860,Fuck!
01:29:39.499,01:29:41.918,Hey. I can't believe you wanted to meet here.
01:29:42.960,01:29:43.920,Seemed appropriate.
01:29:45.046,01:29:48.132,"I mean, you guys got your dicks sucked at this table, for Christ's sake."
01:29:48.549,01:29:49.884,"Not anymore, Tom."
01:29:49.967,01:29:51.552,"-Yeah, well-- -Not anymore."
01:29:51.636,01:29:52.970,The label's fed up with you.
01:29:54.347,01:29:55.556,They're dropping you.
01:29:55.640,01:30:00.269,"You convinced them to give you back the rights to your music, so you own it all now."
01:30:02.980,01:30:04.690,"-It's what you wanted, right? -Yep."
01:30:06.442,01:30:07.443,Are you happy?
01:30:14.992,01:30:15.910,Still...
01:30:17.537,01:30:19.872,"we had a pretty good ride, though, right?"
01:30:21.666,01:30:22.917,"Yeah, we had a good ride."
01:30:24.961,01:30:26.712,"I liked it better with Vince, though."
01:30:30.842,01:30:31.801,Yeah.
01:30:57.785,01:30:59.245,You're really Frank Feranna?
01:31:02.748,01:31:04.041,This is way too trippy.
01:31:04.584,01:31:05.626,You're Nikki Sixx.
01:31:06.627,01:31:08.171,I grew up on Mötley Crüe.
01:31:08.504,01:31:11.799,"I mean, I got laid for the first time to Home Sweet Home."
01:31:13.176,01:31:14.302,You guys still play?
01:31:15.261,01:31:16.095,"Yeah, man."
01:31:16.596,01:31:17.763,Glad you dig the band.
01:31:21.100,01:31:23.144,"Yep, that's my dad."
01:31:24.061,01:31:25.855,"Well, our dad."
01:31:27.690,01:31:28.524,Crazy!
01:31:28.858,01:31:30.943,Nikki Sixx and I have the same dad.
01:31:35.490,01:31:37.450,He had a heart attack on Christmas Day.
01:31:40.912,01:31:42.246,"He was an asshole, man."
01:31:43.623,01:31:45.249,You're lucky you never knew him.
01:31:57.220,01:31:59.889,looking for something I could never find.
01:32:00.890,01:32:03.726,And here it was right in front of me the whole time...
01:32:04.894,01:32:07.522,and up on stage with me every night.
01:32:18.157,01:32:19.200,"Hey, man."
01:32:21.994,01:32:23.454,What I did at your wedding...
01:32:27.792,01:32:28.626,I didn't...
01:32:29.168,01:32:30.002,know...
01:32:30.711,01:32:31.712,how to do that.
01:32:32.713,01:32:33.631,How to be there.
01:32:33.714,01:32:35.091,"What's up, Nikki?"
01:32:36.008,01:32:42.807,"I was really fucking selfish and I shit on something that was important to you, and I am really sorry."
01:32:45.643,01:32:47.645,"I know you pretty well, Sixx, so..."
01:32:49.021,01:32:49.939,I kinda get it.
01:32:51.691,01:32:52.608,And it's okay.
01:32:55.069,01:32:57.071,But can you say that last part one more time for me?
01:32:59.198,01:33:00.157,"Come in, man."
01:33:02.868,01:33:04.537,I heard you and Heather broke up.
01:33:05.871,01:33:06.747,Yeah.
01:33:07.999,01:33:11.002,I think she's gonna end up being the one that got away.
01:33:15.464,01:33:16.382,"I'm sorry, man."
01:33:16.632,01:33:18.301,Knew I'd get you to say it again!
01:33:18.384,01:33:19.427,Fuck you.
01:33:21.345,01:33:22.179,All right.
01:33:23.014,01:33:24.015,We're going on a mission.
01:33:44.410,01:33:45.703,"How's that new hip, dude?"
01:33:45.786,01:33:47.580,Feel like The Terminator now or some shit?
01:33:47.663,01:33:50.041,"Touch the chair and I'll terminate you, Drummer."
01:33:51.208,01:33:52.460,"Ready for this, Mick?"
01:33:53.961,01:33:55.004,Thank you.
01:34:05.181,01:34:06.682,Stop looking at me like that.
01:34:07.224,01:34:09.727,Let's go get our fucking singer back already.
01:34:09.977,01:34:11.187,"Aye-aye, captain."
01:34:11.854,01:34:13.022,Goddammit.
01:34:22.239,01:34:23.074,"Hey, Vince."
01:34:24.659,01:34:25.576,"Hey, man."
01:34:28.371,01:34:30.456,"Just wanna talk, Vinnie. That's it."
01:34:33.793,01:34:34.710,"Come on, Vinnie."
01:34:38.172,01:34:39.131,Let's talk.
01:34:41.926,01:34:43.094,I was scared.
01:34:43.511,01:34:48.015,"After what happened with Razzle, I was scared that I was losing the only thing that ever mattered to me."
01:34:48.099,01:34:49.475,"-Yeah, your band. -No."
01:34:50.142,01:34:51.185,No. This.
01:34:52.603,01:34:53.437,This.
01:34:53.688,01:34:55.564,"Look, we went to war together."
01:34:55.648,01:35:00.653,"Shit changes, people change, but I don't fucking care if Mötley Crüe never plays another note."
01:35:01.153,01:35:04.073,All I want is my fucking brother back.
01:35:04.907,01:35:09.453,Because this is the only family that I've ever known.
01:35:14.875,01:35:16.001,Fuck.
01:35:17.336,01:35:18.379,"We love you, Vin."
01:35:19.213,01:35:20.673,"Okay, fuck, I love you."
01:35:23.426,01:35:26.679,"And I am sorry about Skylar, man."
01:35:35.146,01:35:36.105,Fuck.
01:35:38.983,01:35:40.693,"It's against the laws, man."
01:35:44.071,01:35:47.742,It's against the fucking rules of the universe.
01:35:50.995,01:35:51.871,Hey.
01:35:55.458,01:35:56.792,"We got you, brother."
01:35:58.377,01:35:59.754,"We got you, brother."
01:36:01.464,01:36:02.423,We got you.
01:36:03.382,01:36:06.051,Nikki. It's show time. Let's go.
01:36:12.767,01:36:14.101,"Mick, let's do it."
01:36:20.065,01:36:21.859,"Tommy, time to shine."
01:37:10.658,01:37:14.954,"and Mars plugs in his guitar, something happens, man."
01:37:19.124,01:37:21.669,"You don't just hear it, you feel it."
01:37:30.135,01:37:33.597,We shit on a lot of people and did things that we regret every day.
01:37:34.265,01:37:37.476,"But somehow, we're still here, in it together."
01:39:33.550,01:39:34.635,"What's up, dude?"
01:39:41.850,01:39:43.060,"What's up, dude?"
01:39:46.355,01:39:50.734,I decided to take my clothes off and run down the halls and harass the shit out of everybody.
01:39:50.818,01:39:55.698,"An old lady poked her head out of her hotel room, called the front desk. They sent the cops up."
01:39:55.781,01:39:58.951,Said a man with long black hair had just been seen running around naked.
01:41:07.936,01:41:09.772,We were gonna call the band Christmas.
01:41:11.190,01:41:14.151,"Could you imagine? Hi, I'm Christmas."
01:41:27.748,01:41:29.708,They found me through an ad in the paper.
01:41:30.000,01:41:32.878,"Loud, rude and aggressive guitar player. Me!"
01:42:08.413,01:42:10.582,We are Mötley fucking Crüe.
