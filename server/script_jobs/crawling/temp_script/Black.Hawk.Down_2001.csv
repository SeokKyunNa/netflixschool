00:03:35.924,00:03:37.759,"Technicals, 9:00."
00:04:03.035,00:04:05.495,"Oh, shit!"
00:04:05.537,00:04:08.707,"Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at 9:00."
00:04:08.749,00:04:10.542,"I got it, Matt."
00:04:10.584,00:04:12.961,I don't think we can touch this.
00:04:15.296,00:04:18.884,This food is the property of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!
00:04:19.426,00:04:20.969,Go back to your homes!
00:04:21.011,00:04:23.638,"Command Super 6-4, we got militia shooting unarmed civilians..."
00:04:23.680,00:04:26.391,down at the food distribution center.
00:04:26.433,00:04:31.271,- Request permission to engage.
00:04:31.312,00:04:33.857,"Negative, Command."
00:04:33.899,00:04:36.484,We cannot intervene.
00:04:36.526,00:04:38.237,Over.
00:04:38.278,00:04:40.197,6-4 returning.
00:04:44.284,00:04:47.579,Pssh!
00:05:30.413,00:05:32.332,Mm.
00:05:40.966,00:05:42.259,Leaving.
00:06:46.698,00:06:49.284,General Garrison?
00:06:49.326,00:06:51.661,"No. No, thanks."
00:06:51.703,00:06:54.915,Bolivar Belicoso.
00:06:54.956,00:06:58.793,- So is this.
00:06:58.835,00:07:00.754,"Miami, my friend, is not Cuba."
00:07:08.136,00:07:11.723,I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.
00:07:11.765,00:07:15.227,We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
00:07:15.269,00:07:18.897,Me? But am I that important?
00:07:18.939,00:07:21.149,I hardly think so.
00:07:21.191,00:07:24.278,You're just a businessman.
00:07:24.319,00:07:26.821,Selling guns to Aidid's militia.
00:07:31.576,00:07:36.539,"You've been here, what, six weeks?"
00:07:38.792,00:07:41.962,Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.
00:07:42.003,00:07:44.714,You put up reward posters.
00:07:44.756,00:07:47.050,Twenty-five thousand dollars.
00:07:47.092,00:07:49.303,"What is this, gunfight at the K.O. Corral?"
00:07:49.344,00:07:53.598,"It's, uh-- It's the O.K. Corral."
00:07:53.640,00:07:58.312,Do you think bringing me in would make him suddenly come to you?
00:07:58.353,00:08:00.105,Make him more agreeable?
00:08:01.731,00:08:05.568,Hmm?
00:08:05.610,00:08:08.738,"You pay for his beds, much less his militia."
00:08:11.158,00:08:14.744,We're not leaving Somalia until we find him.
00:08:14.786,00:08:17.747,And we will find him.
00:08:17.789,00:08:21.126,"of thinking because I grew up without running water, I am simple, General."
00:08:22.877,00:08:25.839,I do know something about history.
00:08:25.880,00:08:30.510,See all this?
00:08:30.551,00:08:35.182,A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.
00:08:35.223,00:08:38.518,"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
00:08:38.559,00:08:43.315,"Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't have come here."
00:08:43.357,00:08:45.900,This is civil war.
00:08:45.942,00:08:49.946,"This is our war, not yours."
00:08:51.906,00:08:55.243,Three hundred thousand dead and counting.
00:08:55.285,00:08:57.912,"That's not a war, Mr. Atto."
00:08:59.580,00:09:01.958,"Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?"
00:09:08.048,00:09:10.008,How did he strike you?
00:09:10.050,00:09:12.635,"Urbane, sophisticated, cruel."
00:09:12.677,00:09:14.888,"Yeah, he's a good catch."
00:09:14.929,00:09:17.516,"It'll take some time, but Aidid will feel the loss."
00:09:17.557,00:09:20.519,I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.
00:09:20.560,00:09:24.898,"This isn't Iraq, you know."
00:09:24.939,00:09:27.359,"Boss, most of Washington might disagree."
00:09:27.401,00:09:31.405,They've been calling for these dang situation reports every morning this week.
00:09:31.446,00:09:36.784,"Well, tell them the situation is, uh, fragile."
00:09:43.124,00:09:46.044,"Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Cliff Elvis Wolcott."
00:09:46.086,00:09:48.296,I'll be your pilot this afternoon.
00:09:48.338,00:09:52.092,Federal regulations has designated it the nonsmoking Black Hawk helicopter.
00:09:52.133,00:09:56.804,"For those of you enrolled in our Mogadishu frequent flyer program, you'll be earning 100 free credits this afternoon."
00:09:56.846,00:09:59.266,"And as always, the air sickness bags are located..."
00:09:59.307,00:10:02.310,in the seatback in front of you.
00:10:02.352,00:10:06.647,"Number one indications are good, Cliff. Put her on two."
00:10:21.704,00:10:25.375,"6-1, this is 6-4."
00:10:25.417,00:10:28.628,- I've got some bad news.
00:10:28.669,00:10:30.838,I don't wanna hear about it.
00:10:30.880,00:10:33.383,It is not a word.
00:10:33.425,00:10:35.594,Limo is a word in common usage.
00:10:35.635,00:10:38.138,"That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend."
00:10:38.179,00:10:42.100,Common usage.
00:10:38.179,00:10:44.018,"No. If it's not in the dictionary, it doesn't count."
00:10:44.060,00:10:47.105,It does have to be in the dictionary.
00:10:47.147,00:10:51.359,Listen.
00:10:51.401,00:10:54.112,"You touch my limo and I'll spank you, Nightstalker."
00:10:54.154,00:10:56.197,"Yeah, promises."
00:10:56.239,00:10:58.492,That's a nice beach down there.
00:10:58.533,00:11:00.243,How's the water?
00:11:00.285,00:11:04.664,"Yeah, it's nice and warm."
00:11:10.711,00:11:12.589,Name?
00:11:12.631,00:11:14.299,Last name?
00:11:15.925,00:11:19.678,"First name, Todd."
00:11:19.720,00:11:23.141,- What's what like?
00:11:23.183,00:11:26.019,Serial number?
00:11:27.937,00:11:29.897,"Firstly, it's the Mog, or simply Mog."
00:11:29.939,00:11:31.899,No one calls it Mogadishu here.
00:11:31.941,00:11:35.362,"Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask."
00:11:35.403,00:11:38.114,- Why not?
00:11:40.158,00:11:44.829,"Look, kid, you look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you."
00:11:44.871,00:11:48.082,I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from going on the missions.
00:11:49.750,00:11:52.045,- Typing.
00:11:52.086,00:11:54.673,No.
00:11:54.713,00:11:57.634,Date of birth?
00:12:03.890,00:12:05.559,"Well, I'm here to kick some ass."
00:12:10.605,00:12:12.065,Let's bring it in.
00:12:27.622,00:12:29.583,"Nice, man! Very smooth!"
00:12:29.624,00:12:31.710,Single shot through the engine block.
00:12:31.750,00:12:34.753,"Shit, that's a shame."
00:12:58.445,00:13:00.988,Cease fire!
00:13:01.030,00:13:03.991,- Check your weapons.
00:13:06.035,00:13:09.830,Sergeant.
00:13:09.872,00:13:13.084,- Yeah?
00:13:13.126,00:13:16.170,Not to me you're not.
00:13:16.212,00:13:19.048,He should be around here somewhere.
00:13:19.090,00:13:21.342,"Yeah, go ahead."
00:13:22.801,00:13:24.721,You brought your weapon.
00:13:24.763,00:13:26.847,Want me to shoot?
00:13:26.889,00:13:29.768,When did you get in?
00:13:33.938,00:13:35.774,"Hey, who's hungry?"
00:13:58.630,00:14:02.509,"What is this, Sergeant?"
00:14:02.550,00:14:05.178,Not if General Garrison's asking.
00:14:05.219,00:14:07.138,"Have a nice meal, Captain."
00:14:11.601,00:14:15.104,"Hey, man, there's a line."
00:14:15.146,00:14:17.231,"Well, this isn't the back of it."
00:14:19.693,00:14:21.944,Sergeant. Sergeant!
00:14:21.986,00:14:24.280,What's going on here?
00:14:24.322,00:14:27.033,Some aerial target practice.
00:14:27.074,00:14:29.202,I'm talkin' about your weapon.
00:14:29.243,00:14:32.205,"Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon."
00:14:32.246,00:14:35.249,You know better than that.
00:14:35.291,00:14:37.711,"Well, this is my safety, sir."
00:14:40.296,00:14:43.842,"Let it go, sir."
00:14:43.883,00:14:46.845,You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.
00:14:46.886,00:14:49.556,"Let me tell you something, Sergeant."
00:14:49.597,00:14:53.309,"When we get on the five-yard line, you're gonna need my Rangers."
00:14:53.351,00:14:55.520,So y'all better learn to be team players.
00:14:55.562,00:14:58.147,We're done here.
00:15:07.657,00:15:11.745,Speak up. You say this is your safety?
00:15:11.786,00:15:13.830,"Well, this is my boot, son."
00:15:13.872,00:15:18.042,And it will fit up your ass with the proper amount of force.
00:15:18.084,00:15:20.044,Is that a Jersey accent?
00:15:20.086,00:15:22.004,I'm trying to do this.
00:15:22.046,00:15:24.090,"Take those sunglasses off, soldier."
00:15:24.131,00:15:26.092,"If Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business."
00:15:26.133,00:15:28.094,I don't wanna see 'em on you again. Hoo-ah.
00:15:30.304,00:15:31.972,Is that a hot weapon?
00:15:37.395,00:15:41.357,Is that your move?
00:15:41.399,00:15:45.236,I can mate you in three whatever you do.
00:15:45.278,00:15:48.489,I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling with others.
00:15:48.531,00:15:50.408,"Well, she's just lying in wait."
00:15:53.912,00:15:55.830,Griz. Yikes.
00:15:57.916,00:16:00.418,It's good.
00:16:00.460,00:16:03.296,Ah.
00:16:03.337,00:16:06.966,Observation.
00:16:07.007,00:16:09.218,Right.
00:16:09.260,00:16:12.764,They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.
00:16:12.806,00:16:17.435,"This is the part of the story where our knight, our warrior, is about to slay the one-eyed dragon."
00:16:17.477,00:16:19.771,That's scary.
00:16:19.813,00:16:24.859,- I thought you finished that last week.
00:16:24.901,00:16:29.489,"We are at the ten-yard line here, men. You understand?"
00:16:29.530,00:16:31.616,Can you count?
00:16:31.658,00:16:35.202,"One, two, ten. Okay?"
00:16:35.244,00:16:38.915,- Where are my running backs?
00:16:38.957,00:16:42.710,"Hey, I didn't see you in church on Sunday, soldier."
00:16:42.752,00:16:44.838,You had something more important to do?
00:16:44.879,00:16:47.006,"Not on Sunday, you don't."
00:16:47.047,00:16:49.467,"I will make you believe, you understand?"
00:17:04.440,00:17:06.400,"It's pretty funny, hoo-ah?"
00:17:09.403,00:17:12.532,It was a good impression.
00:17:15.409,00:17:17.704,"All right, carry on."
00:17:17.745,00:17:20.373,"Quick word, Specialist."
00:17:20.414,00:17:22.917,"Tell me, Pilla."
00:17:22.959,00:17:25.211,"You understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?"
00:17:25.252,00:17:28.297,"Roger that, sir."
00:17:25.252,00:17:30.758,"'Cause if I ever see you undermining it again, you'll be cleaning latrines with your tongue until you can't taste the difference..."
00:17:30.800,00:17:33.011,between shit and French fries.
00:17:33.052,00:17:34.804,Are we clear?
00:17:43.187,00:17:46.106,Listen to this.
00:17:43.187,00:17:49.569,"If one skinny kills another skinny, his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels."
00:17:49.610,00:17:52.822,A hundred camels.
00:17:52.864,00:17:55.575,Must be a lot a fucking camel debt.
00:17:55.616,00:17:59.286,"- Is that really true, Lieutenant?"
00:17:59.328,00:18:03.457,- He likes the skinnies.
00:18:03.499,00:18:07.503,It's not that I like 'em or I don't like 'em.
00:18:07.545,00:18:09.756,"See, what you guys fail to realize..."
00:18:09.797,00:18:11.883,is the sergeant here is a bit of an idealist.
00:18:11.925,00:18:15.678,He believes in this mission down to his very bones.
00:18:15.720,00:18:23.561,"Look, these people, they have no jobs, no food, no education, no future."
00:18:23.603,00:18:27.147,"I just figure that-- I mean, we have two things that we can do."
00:18:27.189,00:18:31.235,We can either help or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.
00:18:31.277,00:18:33.195,Right?
00:18:33.237,00:18:36.240,"I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight."
00:18:36.282,00:18:38.242,"You trained to fight, Sergeant?"
00:18:38.284,00:18:42.080,"Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth."
00:18:42.121,00:18:45.249,"Like the man said, he's an idealist."
00:18:47.209,00:18:49.169,Wait. This is my favorite part.
00:18:53.800,00:18:56.427,Stay away from the cans!
00:18:56.469,00:18:59.346,"Die, gas pumper!"
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.599,Stay away from those cans!
00:19:01.641,00:19:05.812,- Beales!
00:19:05.853,00:19:09.023,"No, no, no, no."
00:19:09.065,00:19:11.776,"Wilkie, he's having a seizure."
00:19:11.818,00:19:14.528,"Hey, John. It's okay."
00:19:14.570,00:19:16.739,"John, it's okay."
00:20:02.076,00:20:06.039,"Well, he'll be fine, but not in this army."
00:20:06.080,00:20:09.333,He's out of the game.
00:20:13.838,00:20:17.133,I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.
00:20:17.175,00:20:19.719,You got a problem with that?
00:20:19.760,00:20:22.471,"Now, it's a big responsibility."
00:20:22.513,00:20:24.473,Your men are gonna look to you to make the right decisions.
00:20:24.515,00:20:27.518,Their lives depend on it.
00:20:27.560,00:20:29.770,All right.
00:20:29.812,00:20:32.940,"Rangers lead the way, sir."
00:20:32.982,00:20:34.901,"Good luck, Sergeant."
00:21:17.735,00:21:21.239,The long anticipated meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet...
00:21:21.280,00:21:23.908,may take place today at 1500 hours.
00:21:23.950,00:21:29.663,"I say may because we all know by now, with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain."
00:21:29.705,00:21:33.084,This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.
00:21:33.126,00:21:44.220,"Two tier-one personalities may be present: Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor, and Abdi Hassan Awale, Interior Minister."
00:21:44.262,00:21:46.555,These are the guys we're after.
00:21:46.597,00:21:48.266,Today we go.
00:21:48.307,00:21:51.477,Same mission template as before.
00:21:51.518,00:21:54.063,"Fifteen forty-five, Assault Force Delta..."
00:21:54.105,00:21:55.815,will infiltrate the target building...
00:21:55.856,00:21:58.317,and seize all suspects within.
00:21:58.358,00:22:06.575,"Security Force Rangers: four Ranger chalks, under the command of Cpt. Steele, will rope in at 1546 and hold a four-corner perimeter..."
00:22:06.617,00:22:08.661,around the target building.
00:22:08.702,00:22:11.956,No one gets in or out.
00:22:08.702,00:22:14.708,Extraction Force: Lieutenant Colonel McKnight's humvee column...
00:22:14.750,00:22:18.087,will drive into the city at 1547 on Hawlwadig Road...
00:22:18.129,00:22:20.047,and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.
00:22:20.089,00:22:22.382,Wait for the green light.
00:22:22.424,00:22:26.804,"Now, once Delta gives the word, the next column will move to the target building..."
00:22:26.846,00:22:29.389,and load the prisoners on flatbed trucks.
00:22:29.431,00:22:34.436,"Immediately after the prisoners are loaded, the four Ranger chalks..."
00:22:34.478,00:22:38.565,"will collapse back to the target building, load up on humvees..."
00:22:38.607,00:22:42.736,and the entire ground force will exfil the three miles back to base.
00:22:42.778,00:22:45.572,Mission time from incursion to extraction no longer than 30 minutes.
00:22:45.614,00:22:56.209,"Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Specter gunships, but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this."
00:22:56.250,00:22:58.544,Too high-profile.
00:22:58.585,00:23:01.881,So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover...
00:23:01.922,00:23:03.716,with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.
00:23:03.757,00:23:05.718,Colonel Harrell.
00:23:05.759,00:23:10.181,"In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission..."
00:23:10.223,00:23:13.309,and I will coordinate ground forces.
00:23:13.351,00:23:15.353,Colonel Matthews.
00:23:15.393,00:23:18.147,Mission launch code word is Irene.
00:23:18.189,00:23:19.606,Questions?
00:23:22.526,00:23:26.947,"- Which building is it, sir?"
00:23:26.989,00:23:30.117,Somewhere around the Bakara market.
00:23:30.159,00:23:33.371,I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.
00:23:33.411,00:23:36.165,"I didn't say a word, sir."
00:23:36.207,00:23:38.416,Make no mistake.
00:23:38.458,00:23:42.338,"Once you're in the Bakara market, you're in an entirely hostile district."
00:23:42.380,00:23:46.092,Don't underestimate their capabilities.
00:23:46.133,00:23:49.803,We'll be going through friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market.
00:23:49.845,00:23:53.974,So remember the rules of engagement: No one fires unless fired upon.
00:23:54.016,00:23:56.936,Let's go get this thing done.
00:23:56.977,00:23:58.896,"Good luck, gentlemen."
00:24:04.151,00:24:07.029,"What's the matter, Danny?"
00:24:07.071,00:24:16.663,"No Specter gunships, daylight instead of night, late afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat, only part of the city Aidid can mount a serious counterattack on short notice."
00:24:16.705,00:24:20.000,- What's not to like?
00:24:20.042,00:24:23.796,Yeah. For you two.
00:24:23.837,00:24:26.382,"Down in the street, it's unforgiving."
00:25:01.959,00:25:04.837,"What the fuck, Smith?"
00:25:04.878,00:25:07.381,Well?
00:25:07.423,00:25:10.009,We going?
00:25:10.050,00:25:12.345,Why should I tell you that?
00:25:12.386,00:25:15.306,Because I'm me.
00:25:15.348,00:25:19.726,Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.
00:25:19.768,00:25:21.728,Bakara market.
00:25:21.770,00:25:25.441,"Listen, Smith."
00:25:25.483,00:25:27.651,Keep sharp.
00:25:29.153,00:25:31.529,"Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann."
00:25:31.571,00:25:34.532,"Ev, it's gonna be nothing, man."
00:25:34.574,00:25:36.494,Nothing.
00:25:37.995,00:25:40.873,"It's all in the grind, Sizemore."
00:25:40.914,00:25:44.668,Can't be too fine.
00:25:44.710,00:25:47.254,"This, my friend, is a science."
00:25:47.296,00:25:50.757,"I mean, you're looking at the guy that believed the commercials."
00:25:50.799,00:25:53.386,You know?
00:25:53.427,00:25:57.348,I made coffee through Desert Storm.
00:25:57.390,00:26:01.935,"I made coffee through Panama while everyone else got to fight, got to be a Ranger."
00:26:01.977,00:26:04.522,"Now it's Grimesy, black, one sugar..."
00:26:04.562,00:26:07.107,"or Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"
00:26:11.320,00:26:13.822,What happened to you?
00:26:13.864,00:26:18.160,What?
00:26:18.202,00:26:20.704,Your wish has been granted.
00:26:20.746,00:26:22.956,You're fucking me.
00:26:22.998,00:26:25.667,You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.
00:26:25.709,00:26:29.463,Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
00:26:29.505,00:26:31.382,"It's what you wanted, isn't it?"
00:26:31.424,00:26:33.342,"Oh, yeah."
00:26:35.302,00:26:37.971,"Hell, yeah."
00:26:38.013,00:26:40.598,and give him ammo when he needs it. Hoo-ah?
00:26:40.640,00:26:43.477,- Hoo-ah.
00:26:43.519,00:26:45.896,"Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit."
00:26:45.938,00:26:50.359,"Just watch out for the sammys throwing the fucking rocks, and you'll be fine."
00:26:50.401,00:26:52.903,- Might even be fun.
00:26:52.945,00:26:55.573,All we got to do is cover them.
00:26:55.613,00:26:58.534,"Choppers gonna cover us, and we'll be all right."
00:26:58.576,00:27:05.332,"Look, you guys, I know this is my first time as chalk leader, but this isn't our first time out together."
00:27:05.374,00:27:07.126,This is serious.
00:27:07.167,00:27:10.546,"We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass J.R.O.T.C."
00:27:10.588,00:27:14.133,We're elite.
00:27:14.174,00:27:16.302,- Hoo-ah?
00:27:16.343,00:27:17.844,Any questions?
00:27:23.934,00:27:26.479,We're gonna be okay.
00:27:26.520,00:27:28.688,"All right, grab your gear."
00:27:28.730,00:27:30.316,Hoo-ah!
00:27:48.417,00:27:50.377,"You're not gonna need that, dude."
00:27:50.419,00:27:52.754,We're not out there long enough.
00:28:00.471,00:28:02.389,You're not gonna need that either.
00:28:02.431,00:28:05.434,We'll be back before dark.
00:28:05.476,00:28:08.479,- You might as well take dope and beer instead.
00:28:08.521,00:28:11.398,"Ammo, dude."
00:28:17.821,00:28:20.407,"Let me tell you something, Grimes."
00:28:20.449,00:28:23.494,You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.
00:28:23.536,00:28:27.623,"I don't know about you, but I'm not planning on getting shot in the back running away."
00:28:27.665,00:28:30.042,"Well, I better keep mine in."
00:28:30.083,00:28:32.919,"Hey, Grimes."
00:28:30.083,00:28:35.297,"The most important thing: just remember when everybody else is shooting, shoot in the same direction."
00:28:37.383,00:28:38.676,All right.
00:28:44.139,00:28:48.394,"Look at this, Ruiz."
00:28:48.435,00:28:52.356,- That's bad luck.
00:28:52.398,00:28:55.108,All Delta do that.
00:28:55.150,00:28:58.153,"That's bad luck too, man."
00:29:01.323,00:29:03.783,"It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis."
00:29:06.704,00:29:08.622,"If not, I don't know what you'd do."
00:29:08.664,00:29:10.583,"You're a funny guy, man."
00:29:12.959,00:29:15.629,I'm not taking no death letter.
00:29:16.922,00:29:19.799,I'll give it to you back in an hour.
00:29:20.884,00:29:24.137,Blackburn.
00:29:24.179,00:29:27.474,I'm excited.
00:29:27.516,00:29:30.269,I've been training my whole life for this.
00:29:30.310,00:29:33.689,You ever shot at anybody before?
00:29:35.148,00:29:36.483,Me neither.
00:30:10.058,00:30:12.018,You think he's reliable?
00:30:12.060,00:30:14.020,"Well, we'll see."
00:30:14.062,00:30:16.022,It's his first time out.
00:30:23.781,00:30:26.992,Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
00:30:27.033,00:30:31.246,-Tell him to turn his radio off.
00:30:37.043,00:30:40.005,Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy.
00:30:40.046,00:30:42.174,Leave us a message.
00:30:45.302,00:30:47.680,"Hey, baby, it's me."
00:30:47.721,00:30:49.640,Pick up if you're there.
00:30:51.767,00:30:54.436,"I'm just calling to check up on you, make sure everything's all right."
00:30:54.478,00:30:57.731,I'll call you in a couple of hours.
00:30:57.773,00:31:00.526,You'd better not be sleeping.
00:31:00.567,00:31:02.944,"Your move, Randy."
00:31:04.279,00:31:08.742,I'm missing you.
00:31:10.452,00:31:11.745,Hello? Hello?
00:31:13.997,00:31:16.166,"Thanks, bud."
00:31:16.208,00:31:19.961,"You know, it's kind of funny."
00:31:20.003,00:31:24.216,"Beautiful beach, beautiful sun."
00:31:24.257,00:31:26.218,Could almost be a good place to visit.
00:31:26.259,00:31:28.094,Almost.
00:31:31.348,00:31:33.266,You don't think we should be here?
00:31:34.768,00:31:37.312,You know what I think?
00:31:37.354,00:31:39.732,It don't really matter what I think.
00:31:39.773,00:31:47.364,"Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit just goes right out the window."
00:31:47.406,00:31:50.450,I just wanna do it right today.
00:31:50.492,00:31:52.828,Just watch your corner.
00:31:52.870,00:31:55.121,Get all your men back here alive.
00:32:18.645,00:32:21.523,"Now, is this supposed to be the place..."
00:32:21.565,00:32:24.150,or did his car just take a dump?
00:32:24.192,00:32:28.447,"Abdi, come in."
00:32:32.826,00:32:34.244,"Abdi, come in."
00:32:39.374,00:32:42.502,Can you hear me?
00:32:42.544,00:32:45.839,"Abdi, come in."
00:32:45.881,00:32:48.508,"To my right-hand side, above the cafe."
00:32:48.550,00:32:50.677,"Sir, he says this is the building."
00:32:50.719,00:32:52.888,He's certain?
00:32:52.930,00:32:56.725,"Abdi, you need to be sure."
00:32:58.393,00:33:01.187,"Well, it's down the road, two blocks over..."
00:33:01.229,00:33:03.690,on my left.
00:33:03.732,00:33:05.692,But there's too many militia.
00:33:05.734,00:33:08.904,"If I go closer, they might shoot me."
00:33:08.946,00:33:12.073,Now he's saying the building's actually a couple blocks down.
00:33:12.115,00:33:14.743,"But if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot."
00:33:14.785,00:33:17.788,I'll fuckin' shoot him myself a couple blocks down.
00:33:17.830,00:33:21.374,Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the damn building.
00:33:21.416,00:33:24.920,He's not getting paid until he does exactly that.
00:33:24.962,00:33:27.965,It's three miles to the target area.
00:33:28.006,00:33:34.680,"At the K-4 traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National, and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here."
00:33:34.721,00:33:37.474,Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig.
00:33:37.516,00:33:40.477,"and then the assault and blocking forces, and bring 'em back."
00:33:40.519,00:33:43.021,Home in an hour.
00:33:43.062,00:33:46.566,There will be some shooting.
00:33:46.608,00:33:49.235,But be careful what you shoot at because people do live there.
00:33:49.277,00:33:51.279,Hoo-ah!
00:33:51.321,00:33:53.657,Hoo-ah!
00:34:03.500,00:34:07.420,Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette in a bar.
00:34:20.642,00:34:23.102,"Sir, the vehicle is stopped."
00:34:24.938,00:34:28.567,So this is the real deal now.
00:34:28.608,00:34:31.152,He sounds scared shitless.
00:34:31.194,00:34:33.196,Good. That's always a good sign.
00:34:44.541,00:34:47.836,That's it. That's our signal.
00:34:47.878,00:34:52.632,All Q.R.F.
00:34:52.674,00:34:54.968,All Q.R.F.
00:34:59.014,00:35:02.267,"All units, Irene."
00:35:02.308,00:35:04.937,"I say again, Irene."
00:35:12.444,00:35:17.032,Barber 5-1 up and ready.
00:35:17.074,00:35:20.326,- Irene!
00:35:20.368,00:35:22.287,Fuckin' Irene!
00:35:35.675,00:35:37.176,Come on.
00:35:42.348,00:35:44.726,"Good luck, boys."
00:35:44.768,00:35:46.561,Be careful.
00:35:46.603,00:35:48.271,No one gets left behind.
00:35:50.356,00:35:52.317,What's wrong?
00:35:52.358,00:35:56.279,Nothing. He's just never done that before.
00:35:56.321,00:35:58.156,"Aw, fuck!"
00:36:02.201,00:36:04.788,Let's go.
00:36:04.830,00:36:08.458,"Sergeant Struecker, let's roll."
00:38:46.992,00:38:49.286,Two minutes.
00:38:49.327,00:38:50.954,Two minutes.
00:39:35.832,00:39:39.252,Why are they burning tires?
00:39:39.294,00:39:41.296,Signals to the militia that we're coming.
00:39:43.798,00:39:47.677,"5-6, it looks like there's some friendlies on the ground."
00:39:47.719,00:39:49.971,It look like I've got intel on the voice intercept.
00:39:50.013,00:39:51.806,But I've got burning tires in the front of us. Over.
00:39:56.686,00:39:58.646,One minute.
00:39:58.688,00:40:00.815,One minute.
00:40:05.278,00:40:08.031,What's that for?
00:40:08.073,00:40:10.616,Last rope I almost bit my tongue off.
00:40:41.314,00:40:43.608,Touch base.
00:40:47.528,00:40:50.907,"Two feet, one foot."
00:40:53.492,00:40:55.412,Little Birds touching down at target.
00:41:40.999,00:41:43.251,Ropes!
00:41:43.293,00:41:45.795,Go! Go! Go!
00:41:52.969,00:41:56.681,are on the deck.
00:41:56.722,00:42:00.143,This is McKnight.
00:42:11.988,00:42:15.574,Down! Get down!
00:42:15.616,00:42:18.911,- Everybody down!
00:42:18.953,00:42:20.955,Get down on the floor!

01:04:18.563,01:04:21.483,Star 4-1 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured.
01:04:21.525,01:04:23.151,Over.
01:05:02.357,01:05:05.610,I got you.
01:05:12.950,01:05:16.788,"Galentine, you all right?"
01:05:16.830,01:05:19.249,Cover fire now.
01:05:33.137,01:05:35.390,"Hey, Jones!"
01:05:35.432,01:05:39.352,Two pilots are dead.
01:05:39.394,01:05:42.647,This guy's hurt bad.
01:06:15.221,01:06:18.767,"2-6, 2-6, this is 2-5."
01:06:18.809,01:06:21.728,This is 2-6. Roger that.
01:06:21.770,01:06:23.772,"DiTomasso, take the southeast corner."
01:06:23.814,01:06:25.857,We're setting up a perimeter. Over.
01:06:25.899,01:06:28.985,This is 2-6. Roger that.
01:06:32.280,01:06:34.616,"Captain Steele, Captain Steele, come in."
01:06:36.660,01:06:38.995,"Go ahead, 2-5."
01:06:39.036,01:06:43.458,We got two wounded and we got both the pilots dead in the chopper.
01:06:43.500,01:06:45.460,We need a medivac over here now!
01:06:45.502,01:06:48.505,"2-5, they're telling me it's too hot to land the bird."
01:06:48.546,01:06:51.591,You got to secure the perimeter first. Over.
01:06:51.633,01:06:56.262,- Where are the humvees?
01:06:56.304,01:06:59.599,They're encountering a lot of resistance. 6-4 out.
01:07:10.401,01:07:13.530,Get the 50 up!
01:07:13.571,01:07:15.907,You should see the crash directly ahead.
01:07:15.949,01:07:18.493,All I see is a roadblock!
01:07:18.535,01:07:21.663,All right. I'll have to figure out another way.
01:07:46.479,01:07:49.691,Give me a defensive perimeter so we can load the wounded.
01:08:09.878,01:08:12.088,"Fire your weapon, Othic!"
01:08:22.974,01:08:27.144,Tell my girls I'll be okay.
01:08:31.942,01:08:33.818,Othic!
01:08:36.237,01:08:38.197,Medic!
01:08:38.239,01:08:40.157,Hoo-ah!
01:09:08.061,01:09:10.897,Medic! Medic!
01:09:10.939,01:09:13.566,Joyce! Joyce!
01:09:13.608,01:09:16.945,"Come on, help me pick him up!"
01:09:16.987,01:09:21.407,Get us off this fucking street!
01:09:21.449,01:09:26.079,Keep going straight 200 meters.
01:09:27.497,01:09:30.834,"Let's go! Let's go, goddamn it! Let's go!"
01:09:49.644,01:09:52.438,"Hey, Twombles."
01:09:56.526,01:09:58.820,"The humvees ain't coming back, dude."
01:09:58.862,01:10:01.739,What?
01:10:01.781,01:10:04.117,Were we supposed to go to them?
01:10:04.159,01:10:06.119,I thought they were supposed to come to us.
01:10:06.161,01:10:09.455,"Shit. Shit, I think we're supposed to go to them."
01:10:09.497,01:10:11.624,Shit.
01:10:11.666,01:10:13.877,Okay.
01:10:13.918,01:10:16.253,Let's go to the crash site.
01:10:16.295,01:10:19.549,Just don't fire that thing so close to my head.
01:10:19.590,01:10:21.176,"Okay, move out."
01:10:34.271,01:10:35.899,Shit! Get down!
01:10:37.067,01:10:39.903,What'd I just tell you?
01:10:39.944,01:10:46.784,"I swear to God, you do that again-- - You okay?"
01:10:46.826,01:10:49.204,"Nelson, you all right?"
01:10:49.245,01:10:51.455,What?
01:10:51.497,01:10:54.667,"Search and rescue bird on station, inserting medics."
01:11:12.018,01:11:13.603,"Go, go!"
01:11:15.563,01:11:19.609,Son of a bitch.
01:11:19.650,01:11:23.238,"Super 6-8, there is smoke coming from the top of your rotor."
01:11:23.279,01:11:26.950,- Advise you to come out now.
01:11:29.410,01:11:32.371,"Art, I've got skinnies with R.P.G.'s at 12:00."
01:11:32.413,01:11:34.124,- Go! Go!
01:11:34.165,01:11:36.333,Got 'em.
01:11:46.177,01:11:49.472,6-8 comin' out.
01:11:49.513,01:11:52.433,Super 6-8 is out. Over.
01:12:02.026,01:12:04.779,"Hey, Wilkie, what's the situation in there?"
01:12:04.821,01:12:07.240,Both pilots are dead.
01:12:07.282,01:12:10.785,"2-5, we can't move these guys, Matty."
01:12:10.827,01:12:12.787,We'll kill them just carrying them.
01:12:12.829,01:12:15.248,Stabilize in here?
01:12:15.290,01:12:18.084,Stabilize in the bird.
01:12:18.126,01:12:21.045,"Understood, Wilkie."
01:12:21.087,01:12:24.423,"Super 6-4, come inbound and take Wolcott's position."
01:12:24.465,01:12:27.551,Roger. 6-4 is inbound.
01:12:53.703,01:12:56.622,"Super 6-4, you all right?"
01:12:56.664,01:12:59.625,This is Super 6-4.
01:12:59.667,01:13:02.128,You sure? You look like you got clipped pretty good.
01:13:02.170,01:13:06.674,Instrument panels are okay.
01:13:06.716,01:13:09.135,"Got a slight vibration in the pedals, but we're good."
01:13:09.177,01:13:13.472,"All right, put her down on the airfield, Super 6-4."
01:13:13.514,01:13:15.933,Roger.
01:13:18.936,01:13:22.232,I'm getting a lot of movement in these pedals.
01:13:36.037,01:13:39.165,We lost the tail rotor.
01:13:40.208,01:13:44.628,6-4 is going down!
01:13:46.256,01:13:48.632,6-4 going down.
01:13:52.595,01:13:55.265,We're going down. Wait!
01:13:58.559,01:14:01.771,Get Struecker's column back out there.
01:14:01.812,01:14:04.774,They need to get to Durant's crash site fast.
01:14:04.815,01:14:08.527,I want 'em out of there.
01:14:12.573,01:14:15.576,"Captain Steele, we gotta move or we're gonna get pinned down!"
01:14:15.618,01:14:18.121,We're moving just as fast as we can.
01:14:18.162,01:14:21.165,You let me do my job and you do yours. Over.
01:14:28.339,01:14:33.428,Fuck! Fuck!
01:14:33.469,01:14:37.640,"Fuck this! Captain Steele, I'll take out the threat in the window."
01:14:37.681,01:14:40.351,We'll rally point at the gray building.
01:14:40.393,01:14:43.146,- Sergeant!
01:14:43.187,01:14:45.231,Move!
01:14:47.733,01:14:50.527,Cover me!
01:14:54.865,01:14:57.576,"- Let's go, let's move!"
01:15:03.040,01:15:06.002,- Friendly!
01:15:06.043,01:15:08.296,"Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
01:15:08.338,01:15:11.799,"Come on, come on, come on, come on!"
01:15:18.306,01:15:21.309,Move it out! Move up!
01:15:21.351,01:15:23.602,What the fuck are you doing out there?
01:15:23.644,01:15:25.729,I'm doing my job!
01:15:25.771,01:15:28.816,"We got to get out on that street, and we got to move!"
01:15:28.858,01:15:32.028,"You have got to keep up, sir!"
01:15:32.069,01:15:33.946,"Don't you ever give me orders, Sergeant."
01:15:33.988,01:15:38.951,We are combat ineffective.
01:15:38.993,01:15:41.578,"Then give me some of your shooters, and I'll circle us to the bird."
01:15:44.915,01:15:47.418,Grimes!
01:15:47.460,01:15:50.046,"- Yes, sir!"
01:15:50.087,01:15:52.298,Rejoin with Sergeant Eversmann.
01:15:52.340,01:15:56.344,"The rest of you men secure this position, treat the wounded."
01:15:56.386,01:15:59.347,"We'll wait for the convoy, then we'll rally at the crash site. Roger!"
01:15:59.389,01:16:01.224,"My guys, let's go!"
01:16:32.588,01:16:38.177,"C-2, I have two Delta snipers, Shughart and Gordon, volunteering to secure crash site two. Over."
01:16:38.219,01:16:42.223,"No, Super 6-2."
01:16:42.265,01:16:44.308,Can't risk another bird.
01:16:44.350,01:16:47.103,We don't see anything moving down there now.
01:16:47.144,01:16:49.105,We don't even know if anyone's alive.
01:16:49.146,01:16:53.234,A ground team is being organized to go in now.
01:16:53.276,01:16:58.155,- E.T.A. on ground team. Over.
01:16:58.197,01:17:00.491,Do what you can from the air.
01:17:04.161,01:17:08.291,"All right, gather around!"
01:17:08.332,01:17:11.001,We're going back in to get him.
01:17:11.043,01:17:13.003,Is there anyone alive on that?
01:17:13.045,01:17:15.423,- No one gets left behind.
01:17:15.465,01:17:17.216,All right.
01:17:17.258,01:17:20.511,Refit and max out ammo and grenades.
01:17:20.553,01:17:23.931,"Sizemore, where the hell you think you're going?"
01:17:23.973,01:17:26.683,"Not with that cast on, you're not."
01:17:26.725,01:17:28.727,"All right, all right, all right."
01:17:28.769,01:17:32.189,Go get your K-pot.
01:17:32.231,01:17:35.401,Talk to me.
01:17:35.443,01:17:40.281,"Thomas, everyone feels the same way you do, all right?"
01:17:40.323,01:17:43.618,It's what you do right now that makes a difference.
01:17:43.659,01:17:47.788,It's your call.
01:17:53.043,01:17:54.711,Hoo-ah.
01:18:11.479,01:18:14.231,It'll probably help to wash the blood out of the humvees.
01:18:23.866,01:18:26.327,Sergeant Struecker!
01:18:26.369,01:18:30.164,Sergeant Struecker!
01:18:30.206,01:18:32.041,You got some ammo?
01:18:32.082,01:18:34.627,Hop in!
01:18:51.477,01:18:54.397,Wait!
01:18:54.438,01:18:56.857,"Let's go, Thomas."
01:19:19.255,01:19:21.173,Which way?
01:19:25.595,01:19:27.555,"That way, I think!"
01:19:27.597,01:19:31.183,Don't talk so fucking loud!
01:20:03.048,01:20:04.925,Nice donkey.
01:20:22.401,01:20:24.361,Rangers?
01:20:24.403,01:20:30.242,- Who?
01:20:30.284,01:20:34.664,- Fuck!
01:20:34.705,01:20:37.750,"- Well, come to us!"
01:20:50.304,01:20:53.932,"Sorry, Sarge!"
01:20:53.974,01:20:57.728,Never mind.
01:20:57.770,01:21:01.064,"You wanna know why? You said, You're not gonna need that."
01:21:01.106,01:21:03.150,I wasn't saying it to you.
01:21:03.192,01:21:05.736,Aaugh!
01:21:05.778,01:21:08.280,We're gonna need night vision.
01:21:08.322,01:21:10.949,Huh?
01:21:10.991,01:21:14.286,It's my fault. I-- We need to get out of here.
01:21:14.328,01:21:17.039,That way.
01:21:17.080,01:21:19.333,Which way?
01:21:19.375,01:21:22.252,I thought you might know.
01:21:22.294,01:21:24.505,Let's move out.
01:21:29.510,01:21:32.929,"Nelson, Twombly?"
01:21:32.971,01:21:34.973,"Nelson, Twombly, come in."
01:21:35.015,01:21:38.227,We need a position of the convoy. Over.
01:21:38.268,01:21:40.688,"I can't raise 'em, Sergeant."
01:21:40.730,01:21:42.398,"Sir, let's get the fuck out of here and evac!"
01:21:44.024,01:21:45.984,Let's move out!
01:21:46.026,01:21:48.987,Back to the stronghold!
01:21:51.365,01:21:56.662,"Ground forces have occupied several buildings along Marehan Road, but they're all spread out."
01:21:56.704,01:22:00.999,Eversmann's Chalk Four has set up a perimeter around Wolcott's crash site here.
01:22:01.041,01:22:03.753,DiTomasso is in the adjacent structure.
01:22:03.794,01:22:07.172,"Captain Steele and about 40 men, Rangers, are here."
01:22:07.214,01:22:09.925,A couple blocks away.
01:22:09.966,01:22:12.344,He set up a casualty collection point.
01:22:12.386,01:22:14.346,I don't think they're gonna be able to move.
01:22:14.388,01:22:17.140,Sergeant Sanderson and a small Delta team...
01:22:17.182,01:22:21.103,are moving from Steele's position to the crash site as we speak.
01:22:31.614,01:22:36.326,Draw off fire!
01:22:36.368,01:22:39.162,Go!
01:22:41.290,01:22:43.500,Again!
01:22:46.295,01:22:49.047,Loading!
01:22:51.258,01:22:54.511,- Keep going! Keep going!
01:22:56.012,01:22:58.140,I got it!
01:22:59.182,01:23:00.267,"Ah, shit!"
01:23:14.114,01:23:16.617,R.P.G.!
01:23:28.963,01:23:31.298,You all right?
01:23:31.340,01:23:33.300,You okay?
01:23:33.342,01:23:35.511,I can hear bells ringing.
01:23:35.552,01:23:37.847,Come on!
01:23:37.888,01:23:42.017,Come on! Go!
01:23:49.107,01:23:52.736,"There's a crowd advancing six, seven blocks from the crash."
01:23:52.778,01:23:56.365,Shughart and Gordon again request permission to secure until convoy arrives.
01:23:56.406,01:24:01.787,- Over.
01:24:01.829,01:24:04.748,"From where they are, they can see things clearer than any of us."
01:24:04.790,01:24:07.459,They know what they're asking.
01:24:07.501,01:24:10.587,Let me talk to 'em.
01:24:10.629,01:24:16.844,"I want to make sure that y'all understand what you're asking for, so say it out loud and clear."
01:24:16.886,01:24:20.514,We're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives.
01:24:20.556,01:24:23.851,And you realize that I cannot tell you when that might be.
01:24:23.893,01:24:26.937,- It could take quite a while.
01:24:26.979,01:24:29.690,- And you still want to go in there?
01:24:33.777,01:24:36.279,Harrell?
01:24:36.321,01:24:39.074,Roger that.
01:24:40.659,01:24:43.037,"Goffena, put 'em in."
01:25:02.180,01:25:04.725,- R.P.G.!
01:25:14.902,01:25:17.362,Set up your perimeter!
01:25:23.577,01:25:26.413,"There's a fucking rocket in him, sir!"
01:25:26.455,01:25:30.626,"Calm down, goddamn it!"
01:25:30.667,01:25:33.253,Son of a bitch.
01:25:34.630,01:25:36.757,"All right, lift him up!"
01:25:36.799,01:25:39.051,"Easy, easy!"
01:25:39.093,01:25:42.930,"Good, good! Easy, easy!"
01:25:42.972,01:25:45.390,Get in that truck and drive.
01:25:45.432,01:25:49.061,Everybody's shot!
01:25:49.103,01:25:52.982,"Surveillance says to take Hawlwadig, then go straight."
01:25:53.023,01:25:57.444,"McKnight, we need you to turn around and head back to Hawlwadig."
01:25:57.486,01:25:59.655,You're shitting me!
01:25:59.696,01:26:01.657,There's gotta be a better route!
01:26:01.698,01:26:03.951,That's the info I'm getting from J.O.C.
01:26:03.993,01:26:06.954,You need to turn around and head back.
01:26:06.996,01:26:10.499,"Roger that, roger that."
01:26:10.540,01:26:13.627,I cannot believe this shit!
01:26:13.669,01:26:16.171,- They're trying to get us all fucking killed!
01:26:16.212,01:26:18.090,Drive!
01:26:18.132,01:26:20.467,Get us out of here!
01:26:28.224,01:26:31.812,Keep your foot on the gas!
01:26:28.224,01:26:44.700,Keep your foot on the-- Fuck!
01:26:47.202,01:26:48.411,Shit.
01:27:03.969,01:27:07.806,"C-2, Shughart and Gordon are on the deck. Over."
01:27:33.999,01:27:35.918,Friendlies!
01:27:37.627,01:27:39.213,It's good to see you!
01:27:39.254,01:27:42.049,It's good to see you.
01:27:42.091,01:27:44.676,and my back feels kind of weird.
01:27:44.718,01:27:48.346,"We've got to get you out of here, buddy."
01:27:51.725,01:28:02.569,Wait. I-- Put you down.
01:28:02.611,01:28:06.656,"C-2, we're at the 6-4 crash site, securing perimeter."
01:28:06.698,01:28:08.742,You all right?
01:28:08.784,01:28:11.661,You're locked and loaded.
01:28:08.784,01:28:14.831,"Any skinnies come around these corners, - you watch our backs."
01:28:14.873,01:28:16.875,We're it.
01:28:22.089,01:28:24.049,"All right, stop, stop, stop, stop. Maddox, stop."
01:28:25.759,01:28:29.763,"Son of a bitch. Romeo 6-4, we're back where we started."
01:28:29.805,01:28:35.727,"I'm running low on ammo, I got many wounded, including me, vehicles that are barely running."
01:28:35.769,01:28:38.688,"Okay, Danny, I need a no B.S."
01:28:38.730,01:28:41.150,Can you get to the crash site?
01:28:41.191,01:28:44.278,"Colonel, I can't see shit."
01:28:47.447,01:28:49.616,Negative.
01:28:49.658,01:28:52.535,"With the amount of wounded we have, we'd do more harm than good."
01:28:52.577,01:28:57.040,"We need to come back to base, rearm and regroup, and then we can go back out."
01:28:59.293,01:29:03.172,"C-2, bring 'em back."
01:29:03.213,01:29:05.924,Roger. Return to base.
01:29:05.966,01:29:10.053,We're going home!
01:29:23.317,01:29:26.862,Roger that. Understand.
01:29:31.700,01:29:33.660,What's up?
01:29:33.702,01:29:36.121,The convoy's headed back to base camp.
01:29:36.163,01:29:39.833,"That makes sense, don't it?"
01:29:39.875,01:29:43.377,and get out of here before it's too late!
01:29:43.419,01:29:45.797,"If Colonel McKnight went back to base, then he had a good reason."
01:29:45.839,01:29:48.800,- It changes nothing.
01:29:48.842,01:29:52.554,"We're gonna hold the perimeter, and we're gonna hold the strongpoint. Hoo-ah?"
01:29:52.595,01:29:53.972,Hoo-ah!
01:29:54.014,01:29:57.100,Conserve your ammo.
01:29:57.142,01:29:59.144,Hoo-ah.
01:29:59.186,01:30:03.565,The convoy's gonna come.
01:30:15.409,01:30:16.661,Loading!
01:30:25.003,01:30:26.671,Loading!
01:30:26.713,01:30:28.924,"Randy, I need a pistol mag!"
01:30:41.435,01:30:43.272,Loading!
01:30:46.858,01:30:49.027,"Randy, last mag!"
01:30:52.155,01:30:53.073,Gordy!
01:30:55.491,01:30:57.451,Fuck!
01:31:10.464,01:31:13.302,"Gordy's gone, man."
01:31:13.343,01:31:15.304,Good luck.
01:31:36.158,01:31:39.328,We need the 10th Mountain in there. Everything they got.
01:31:39.369,01:31:42.956,"Pakistanis, Malays."
01:31:42.998,01:31:45.083,They still don't know we've gone in.
01:31:45.125,01:31:49.671,"Look, we have stirred up the hornet's nest here."
01:31:49.712,01:31:53.675,I want every vehicle possible that's got four wheels and armor. Get it.
01:31:53.716,01:31:55.760,Get everything.
01:31:53.716,01:31:59.513,"Once they've assembled, we're gonna move our men out of the hostile area and back to the Pakistani stadium."
01:31:59.555,01:32:01.515,The safe zone. Let's go.
01:32:01.557,01:32:03.477,"Roger that, Boss."
01:34:40.300,01:34:42.385,On your knees!
01:34:47.516,01:34:51.394,Stay with me. You just got a bullet in the leg.
01:34:55.940,01:34:58.901,those tires are burning?
01:34:58.943,01:35:02.614,"Roger. I can see it, but I can't get there."
01:35:02.656,01:35:05.783,Go 100 meters past it.
01:35:05.825,01:35:08.453,Negative.
01:35:08.495,01:35:13.542,It's roadblock after roadblock.
01:35:13.583,01:35:17.253,There ain't one.
01:35:17.295,01:35:21.299,- Roger that.
01:35:21.341,01:35:25.637,Request permission to move to crash site number two on foot. Over.
01:35:25.679,01:35:28.722,"Green light, Kilo 1-1."
01:35:28.764,01:35:31.518,Stop the vehicle.
01:36:15.228,01:36:19.649,"After I'm finished with this, I'll whip you boys up some margaritas."
01:36:19.691,01:36:22.485,The usual.
01:36:29.825,01:36:32.870,This is Kilo 1-2.
01:36:46.800,01:36:49.679,"Eversmann, come in."
01:36:52.098,01:36:55.685,"Roger, who is this?"
01:36:52.098,01:36:59.147,"Sanderson. Do not-- I say again, do not fire to the east."
01:36:59.188,01:37:01.190,Understood.
01:37:01.232,01:37:05.069,DiTomasso and his men are on the southeast corner.
01:37:05.111,01:37:08.822,We need you on the northeast building.
01:37:08.864,01:37:10.950,Watch out for skinnies.
01:37:10.992,01:37:14.078,"They're in prayer, but not for much longer."
01:37:16.665,01:37:18.291,Hold your fire to the east.
01:37:40.605,01:37:42.816,Eversmann? It's Yurek.
01:37:42.856,01:37:45.819,I got Nelson and Twombly with me.
01:37:45.859,01:37:50.323,- We got the chopper in sight.
01:37:50.365,01:37:52.908,- Where have you been?
01:37:54.285,01:37:57.121,Hold your fire.
01:38:01.125,01:38:05.963,We got to go.
01:38:06.005,01:38:10.385,"When he gets across the street, he's gonna turn around and cover you as you run."
01:38:10.426,01:38:13.805,"When you get there, you're gonna turn around and you're gonna cover me, okay?"
01:38:15.889,01:38:17.975,You're not just gonna run to Eversmann's position.
01:38:18.017,01:38:20.894,"You're gonna stop, you're gonna turn around, and you are going to cover me."
01:38:20.936,01:38:23.648,It's important you understand that.
01:38:23.690,01:38:25.692,"Okay, you ready?"
01:38:25.734,01:38:27.777,"Yeah, I guess."
01:38:30.946,01:38:33.742,Hey! Don't forget.
01:38:33.783,01:38:36.244,- What?
01:38:49.382,01:38:53.261,I got 'em in my sight.
01:38:53.302,01:38:54.804,I see 'em.
01:38:57.390,01:38:58.892,Let's move out.
01:39:01.060,01:39:03.688,"- Can you cover us, Sergeant?"
01:39:11.987,01:39:13.573,Nelson!
01:39:20.204,01:39:21.372,Fuck!
01:39:29.171,01:39:30.423,Twombly!
01:39:32.133,01:39:34.427,- Smith! No!
01:39:38.389,01:39:42.811,Get it off of me!
01:39:42.852,01:39:45.855,"Come on, man! Come on!"
01:39:45.897,01:39:48.733,Doc! Gimme some help with Smith here!
01:39:55.406,01:39:58.534,My leg! My leg!
01:39:58.576,01:40:00.077,"Come on, Jamie, I got you!"
01:40:07.376,01:40:11.088,"Up, one, two three."
01:40:11.130,01:40:13.215,All right.
01:40:13.257,01:40:15.551,My right thigh!
01:40:15.593,01:40:17.345,Are my balls okay?
01:40:17.386,01:40:20.013,You still have your balls.
01:40:20.055,01:40:23.184,Twombly! Nelson!
01:40:23.225,01:40:25.812,Put him down.
01:40:23.225,01:40:29.315,"Oh, man, that really-- - I need that chair."
01:40:31.359,01:40:35.112,Let me see it!
01:40:36.781,01:40:40.033,"- Oh, fuck!"
01:40:40.075,01:40:42.244,- What the fuck was that?
01:40:42.286,01:40:44.622,Hold that down.
01:40:44.664,01:40:47.375,- Galentine!
01:40:47.416,01:40:49.377,Galentine!
01:40:49.418,01:40:52.964,Sergeant?
01:40:53.006,01:40:54.799,They're not gonna come and get us.
01:40:54.841,01:40:57.176,They're not gonna come for us.
01:40:57.218,01:40:59.846,"I need you to suck it up, Sergeant."
01:40:59.888,01:41:03.265,Can you do that?
01:41:03.307,01:41:06.435,- Can you hold your weapon?
01:41:06.477,01:41:10.690,"Anybody comes through that door, you give him two in the chest and one in the head."
01:41:10.732,01:41:14.443,- You understand?
01:41:14.485,01:41:18.865,"Cpt. Steele! Cpt. Steele, I need a medivac in here now!"
01:41:18.907,01:41:21.826,"- Hold on, 2-5."
01:41:21.868,01:41:24.453,He's hurt pretty bad.
01:41:24.495,01:41:27.289,You're just gonna have to maintain your situation. Over.
01:41:27.331,01:41:30.001,"If he doesn't get to a hospital in a half hour, he's in trouble."
01:41:30.043,01:41:34.087,"C-2, this is 6-4."
01:41:34.129,01:41:37.090,for a critically wounded at Chalk Four's location. Over.
01:41:37.132,01:41:40.135,"Command, Chalk Four is requesting medivac."
01:41:40.177,01:41:42.889,Can't risk it.
01:41:42.931,01:41:48.352,"Captain, we cannot send in medivac at this time."
01:41:48.394,01:41:52.105,"C-5, this is 6-4."
01:41:52.147,01:41:53.983,J.O.C. cannot risk another bird.
01:41:54.025,01:41:56.027,You're just gonna have to hold on.
01:42:02.450,01:42:04.117,All right. I got him.
01:42:04.159,01:42:06.829,I want direct pressure on the wound.
01:42:06.871,01:42:09.916,It's gonna be all right.
01:42:55.044,01:42:59.423,This is Kilo 1-1.
01:43:21.070,01:43:23.405,Crash site two secured.
01:43:23.447,01:43:27.242,"Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir."
01:43:27.284,01:43:31.246,"Sir, they're still debating the route."
01:43:31.288,01:43:34.959,- At least a couple hours.
01:43:35.001,01:43:43.425,"Pakistani general says since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid, it's gonna take some time to mobilize the 10th Mountain and a hundred vehicles."
01:43:43.467,01:43:45.887,You tell the general this.
01:43:45.928,01:43:49.057,"I understand, but it is my duty to remind him..."
01:43:49.098,01:43:53.226,that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed Somali militia.
01:43:53.268,01:43:56.313,It is imperative that we move them out of the hostile area...
01:43:56.355,01:43:58.357,and into the safe zone.
01:43:58.399,01:44:00.359,I need his help now.
01:44:00.401,01:44:03.029,"Yes, sir."
01:44:07.575,01:44:09.577,Durant.
01:44:09.618,01:44:14.247,- Michael Durant.
01:44:14.289,01:44:16.959,You are the Ranger who kills my people?
01:44:17.001,01:44:20.880,I'm not a Ranger.
01:44:23.966,01:44:25.927,That's right.
01:44:25.968,01:44:28.387,None of you Americans smoke anymore.
01:44:30.681,01:44:36.812,"You all live long, dull, uninteresting lives."
01:44:38.564,01:44:41.567,What do you want with me?
01:44:41.609,01:44:44.112,You have taken hostages.
01:44:44.153,01:44:46.114,We have you.
01:44:46.155,01:44:49.825,My government will never negotiate for me.
01:44:49.867,01:44:54.538,"Then perhaps you and I can negotiate, huh?"
01:44:54.580,01:44:57.875,Soldier to soldier.
01:44:59.334,01:45:01.294,Hmm?
01:45:04.632,01:45:06.675,I'm not in charge.
01:45:09.428,01:45:14.225,Course not.
01:45:14.267,01:45:17.394,"In Somalia, killing is negotiation."
01:45:17.436,01:45:25.820,"Do you really think if you get General Aidid, we will simply put down our weapons..."
01:45:25.861,01:45:28.948,and adopt American democracy?
01:45:28.990,01:45:31.450,That the killing will stop?
01:45:31.492,01:45:35.788,We know this.
01:45:35.830,01:45:39.167,"There will always be killing, you see?"
01:45:39.208,01:45:41.334,This is how things are in our world.
01:45:54.347,01:45:57.601,"Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind."
01:46:00.104,01:46:03.482,"Mike Durant, we won't leave you behind."
01:46:06.319,01:46:08.737,You got to take over for me.
01:46:17.121,01:46:26.005,"It's the femoral artery, but I can't see it, which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis, which means that I have to find it and clamp it."
01:46:26.047,01:46:28.549,It's the only way to stop the bleeding.
01:46:28.590,01:46:30.843,"I got no more I.V.'s, so..."
01:46:30.885,01:46:34.805,"I'm gonna need you to assist, okay?"
01:46:34.847,01:46:36.849,"Yeah, yeah."
01:46:36.891,01:46:40.728,"Now, listen, Jamie."
01:46:40.769,01:46:44.065,Okay?
01:46:40.769,01:46:46.859,"I gotta cause you more pain, but I have to do it to help you, you understand?"
01:46:46.901,01:46:49.904,Morphine.
01:46:49.945,01:46:52.323,It'll lower your heart rate too far. I'm sorry.
01:46:52.365,01:46:54.033,"Twombly, why don't you take his hands there."
01:46:59.372,01:47:02.083,Hold the wound open.
01:47:02.124,01:47:04.752,"Yurek, you're gonna take the feet and a flashlight."
01:47:04.793,01:47:08.089,On my count.
01:47:09.590,01:47:14.387,"One, two, three."
01:47:21.936,01:47:26.399,"Wait, wait, wait."
01:47:28.276,01:47:31.195,I got it. I got it.
01:47:31.237,01:47:33.822,You got it? Good.
01:47:36.742,01:47:39.245,I got it clamped.
01:47:39.287,01:47:41.372,"Here, grab it."
01:47:41.414,01:47:43.332,It's tearing.
01:47:43.374,01:47:45.251,"Doc, it's going back in."
01:47:45.293,01:47:46.919,It's tearing!
01:47:46.961,01:47:50.298,"Okay, get out."
01:47:50.339,01:47:52.007,Move your hand.
01:48:03.811,01:48:05.938,What?
01:48:23.998,01:48:26.834,Fix it?
01:48:28.585,01:48:30.921,"Yeah, yeah."
01:48:46.479,01:48:48.772,What the hell are you doing?
01:48:48.814,01:48:50.774,"It's all in the grind, Sarge."
01:48:50.816,01:48:53.068,Can't be too fine.
01:48:53.110,01:48:55.612,"Grimesy, you are squared away."
01:49:12.254,01:49:15.757,"Sarge, how'd you like a nice hot cup of joe?"
01:49:17.926,01:49:20.721,Gold Coast blend.
01:49:20.762,01:49:22.806,Let me take a look at that foot.
01:49:22.848,01:49:25.059,"No, it's not a problem."
01:49:31.940,01:49:34.609,Where the hell did they find you?
01:49:34.651,01:49:37.363,"No, really."
01:49:37.405,01:49:39.740,Do you think I'm kidding?
01:49:43.035,01:49:44.745,Anybody hit?
01:49:49.500,01:49:51.126,You all right?
01:49:51.168,01:49:53.879,Yeah!

01:51:55.792,01:51:58.170,- Who's this? Over.
01:51:58.212,01:52:00.214,I need some coverin' fire. Over.
01:52:00.255,01:52:02.550,"Roger that, Kilo 1-1."

01:52:18.982,01:52:26.031,"If we don't hold back this city, we're gonna have a hundred caskets to fill by morning."
01:52:26.073,01:52:28.950,"Colonel Harrell, ground personnel at crash site one..."
01:52:28.992,01:52:33.746,will have to mark the target with infrared strobes in preparation for air strike.

01:52:44.633,01:52:48.053,"Between the 10th Mountain and U.N., we got enough personnel, okay?"
01:52:49.555,01:52:51.932,"Danny, you guys do not have to go back out again."
01:53:12.745,01:53:16.123,"I can't... die here, man."
01:53:16.164,01:53:18.083,"You're not gonna die, all right?"
01:53:18.125,01:53:20.210,You're not gonna die.
01:53:20.252,01:53:22.963,I'm sorry.
01:53:23.004,01:53:25.716,You don't have anything to be sorry for.
01:53:25.758,01:53:27.718,You saved Twombly.
01:53:27.760,01:53:29.844,You did perfect.
01:53:29.886,01:53:32.306,"You okay, Twombs?"
01:53:32.347,01:53:34.807,"Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie."
01:53:34.849,01:53:37.728,You did what you were trained to do.
01:53:37.770,01:53:40.188,You should be proud of that.
01:53:41.898,01:53:45.319,- Be proud of that.
01:53:45.360,01:53:49.406,Ev?
01:53:49.448,01:53:51.199,Do me a favor.
01:53:53.994,01:53:59.333,You tell my parents that I fought well today.
01:53:59.374,01:54:08.883,And that I-- that I-- that I fought hard.
01:54:10.803,01:54:13.806,"You're gonna tell them yourself, okay?"
01:54:13.846,01:54:17.476,Do you hear me?
01:54:19.728,01:54:22.731,Are the humvees here?
01:54:22.773,01:54:25.442,They're coming.
01:54:25.484,01:54:28.445,You just gotta hang in there a little bit.
01:54:28.487,01:54:31.198,I can. I can.
01:54:32.282,01:54:34.743,It's nothing.
01:54:34.785,01:54:37.245,It's nothing.
01:54:37.287,01:54:39.748,It's nothing.
01:54:39.790,01:54:44.336,It's nothing. Nothing.

01:56:16.678,01:56:18.764,We need the ammo.
01:56:26.354,01:56:28.315,You did all you could here.
01:56:28.356,01:56:32.026,They should've sent a medivac.
01:56:32.068,01:56:35.739,Right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper.
01:56:35.781,01:56:37.950,More men would get torn up.
01:56:41.286,01:56:46.333,Maybe.
01:56:46.374,01:56:51.964,"'Cause, Sergeant, you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't, who falls out of a chopper or why."
01:56:52.005,01:56:54.675,It ain't up to you.
01:56:56.885,01:57:00.096,"Yeah, well, Smith's still dead."
01:57:00.138,01:57:02.098,"Blackburn wouldn't have fallen, none of this would've happened."
01:57:02.140,01:57:05.435,"Should have or could have, it don't matter."
01:57:05.477,01:57:08.480,You'll get plenty of time to think about all that later.
01:57:12.943,01:57:16.613,"Sergeant, you got your men this far."
01:57:16.655,01:57:18.699,You did it right today.
01:57:18.740,01:57:20.909,You need to start thinking about getting these men out of here.
01:57:28.082,01:57:30.836,"Well, shall we?"
01:57:39.052,01:57:41.930,I need four guns in this corner now!
01:57:48.269,01:57:50.772,R.P.G.!
01:57:54.150,01:57:56.653,This is Barber 5-2 in position for gun run.
01:57:56.695,01:57:58.739,Jesus Christ.
01:57:58.780,01:58:01.449,This is 2-5! I can see you.
01:58:01.491,01:58:05.579,- You're right above me.
01:58:05.620,01:58:08.415,- Too much activity.

01:58:21.344,01:58:22.763,You see it?
01:58:24.890,01:58:26.892,Nah. I can't see shit.
01:58:26.934,01:58:29.352,I'm putting it on the roof.
01:58:29.394,01:58:31.855,- You're gonna need some help!
01:58:33.356,01:58:36.443,"Okay, guys, we're gonna lay down some cover fire for him!"
01:58:36.484,01:58:38.111,On three! Ready?
01:58:38.152,01:58:41.322,"One, two, three!"

02:00:01.111,02:00:04.698,"All right, they're here."
02:00:04.739,02:00:07.742,Lay down some cover fire!
02:00:09.452,02:00:11.621,I thought I heard a noise out here!
02:00:11.663,02:00:13.790,Get your men loaded up.
02:00:17.460,02:00:21.923,"2-5, this is 6-4. Rescue column has arrived. We'll be at your location in about 5 minutes."
02:00:21.965,02:00:23.925,Prepare your men for exfil.
02:00:23.967,02:00:27.428,"Yeah, roger that, sir!"
02:00:27.470,02:00:30.306,Five minutes!
02:00:51.578,02:00:53.371,I need a mag!
02:00:53.413,02:00:55.832,"Kurth, my last one!"
02:01:05.299,02:01:07.177,The convoy's here!
02:01:24.903,02:01:26.863,Sergeant Eversmann.
02:01:26.905,02:01:29.449,I heard you guys needed a lift!
02:01:29.490,02:01:33.745,"Yes, sir!"
02:01:40.460,02:01:43.421,"I got you, I got you."
02:01:43.463,02:01:46.591,It's okay.
02:01:46.633,02:01:49.510,"Yeah, I would too."
02:01:58.145,02:02:00.147,"Move, move!"
02:02:03.357,02:02:07.028,"We get the pilots' bodies out, then we go to the stadium."
02:02:07.070,02:02:09.281,We're running out of room around here.
02:02:09.322,02:02:11.658,Just gonna have to cram into every possible space.
02:02:11.699,02:02:17.538,"Okay, 10th Mountain provides security for armor, walks us out of the hot zone."
02:02:17.580,02:02:22.418,10th Mountain? No.
02:02:22.460,02:02:26.547,"We'll walk you out of the hot zone, then jump on the last few vehicles."
02:02:26.589,02:02:30.093,"Okay, let's get out of here."
02:02:30.135,02:02:33.513,"All right, you got him?"
02:02:33.554,02:02:37.142,Come on!
02:02:37.184,02:02:40.061,These things are fucking bullet magnets.

02:02:47.443,02:02:49.904,"Easy, easy."
02:03:04.460,02:03:06.671,"Colonel, what is going on down there?"
02:03:06.713,02:03:10.591,They're dismantling the entire cockpit around the body.
02:03:10.633,02:03:14.387,How long's it gonna take?
02:03:14.428,02:03:16.472,I can't say.
02:03:18.558,02:03:22.812,Danny?
02:03:22.854,02:03:25.857,"You understand me, son?"
02:03:25.899,02:03:28.442,"Yes, General."
02:03:28.484,02:03:32.280,- Do what you have to do.

02:04:08.566,02:04:12.486,- Fire in the hole!
02:04:12.528,02:04:14.655,Let's go! Move out!
02:04:22.830,02:04:26.209,Open up the hatch!
02:04:26.251,02:04:28.211,- What's going on?
02:04:28.253,02:04:30.630,I'm not getting on no fucking roof!
02:04:30.671,02:04:32.590,"- Sir-- - No, no, it's full!"
02:04:34.426,02:04:37.178,We're running out. Keep moving.
02:04:39.973,02:04:42.225,Move it! Let's go!
02:04:58.866,02:05:01.286,Move it up!
02:05:02.870,02:05:04.789,Let's go!
02:05:58.759,02:06:01.762,Get down!
02:06:01.804,02:06:03.556,Get down!
02:06:04.682,02:06:05.933,"Get down, lady!"
02:06:08.728,02:06:11.981,I'm out of ammo!
02:06:18.112,02:06:20.073,Don't you do it.
02:06:20.114,02:06:22.158,What are you doing?
02:06:24.702,02:06:25.953,"Kurth, let's go!"
02:09:40.940,02:09:43.401,"Ah, shit."
02:09:43.443,02:09:46.404,Bullet missed your jugular by about three millimeters.
02:09:48.406,02:09:50.908,"Hurry up, hurry up."
02:09:50.950,02:09:52.952,Grimes?
02:09:54.245,02:09:57.957,"Little short on coffee, but I got you some tea."
02:10:01.669,02:10:04.631,"How you doing, soldier?"
02:10:04.672,02:10:06.591,Can't feel a thing.
02:10:48.924,02:10:51.344,Ruiz.
02:10:51.385,02:10:54.221,"Hey, Sergeant. Hey."
02:10:57.684,02:11:00.311,- Captain.
02:11:00.353,02:11:02.104,How you doing?
02:11:04.816,02:11:09.487,"It went in and out, so the medic said I should be okay, a couple of days."
02:11:09.529,02:11:13.616,That's great news.
02:11:13.658,02:11:16.160,You bet your ass we will.
02:11:17.870,02:11:20.456,Don't go out without me.
02:11:20.498,02:11:24.585,Don't go back out there without me.
02:11:24.627,02:11:27.797,I can still do my job.
02:11:27.839,02:11:31.217,"You get some rest now, okay?"
02:11:45.565,02:11:47.775,You going back in?
02:11:49.652,02:11:51.571,There's still men out there.
02:11:54.073,02:11:57.326,Goddamn.
02:12:00.329,02:12:08.838,"When I go home, people ask me, Hey, Hoot, why do you do it, man?"
02:12:08.880,02:12:12.800,Why? You some kind of war junkie?
02:12:12.842,02:12:16.095,I won't say a goddamn word.
02:12:16.136,02:12:18.305,Why?
02:12:18.347,02:12:21.768,They won't understand.
02:12:21.809,02:12:23.811,They won't understand why we do it.
02:12:25.688,02:12:29.316,They won't understand it's about the men next to you.
02:12:31.402,02:12:34.321,And that's it.
02:12:34.363,02:12:36.282,That's all it is.
02:12:45.332,02:12:48.961,"Hey, don't even think about it, all right?"
02:12:49.002,02:12:51.213,I'm better on my own.
02:12:55.217,02:12:59.054,"Hey, we started a whole new week."
02:13:12.526,02:13:18.950,"I was talking to Blackburn the other day and he asked me, What changed?"
02:13:20.618,02:13:23.454,"And I said, Nothing."
02:13:23.496,02:13:28.000,"But that's not true, you know."
02:13:28.041,02:13:30.127,I know I've changed.
02:13:35.883,02:13:40.888,A friend of mine asked me before I got here-- So we were all shipping out.
02:13:40.930,02:13:47.144,"He asked me, Why are you going to fight somebody else's war?"
02:13:47.186,02:13:49.563,"What do y'all think, you're heroes?"
02:13:52.650,02:13:57.905,"I didn't know what to say at the time, but..."
02:13:57.947,02:14:00.282,"if he asked me again, I'd say no."
02:14:03.118,02:14:06.121,I'd say there's no way in hell.
02:14:06.163,02:14:08.624,Nobody asks to be a hero.
02:14:13.379,02:14:15.715,It just sometimes turns out that way.
02:14:19.593,02:14:22.471,"I'll talk to your ma and pa when I get home, okay?"
02:15:05.222,02:15:11.062,"My love, you're strong and you'll do well in life."
02:15:11.103,02:15:14.607,I love you and my children deeply.
