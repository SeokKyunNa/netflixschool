00:00:48.006,00:00:49.341,"Oh, that's right."
00:00:50.008,00:00:53.679,I'm falling to my death. Guess they can't.
00:00:54.513,00:00:56.473,"How'd it all come to this, you ask?"
00:00:57.641,00:00:59.393,My end starts at the beginning.
00:01:00.018,00:01:01.687,The very beginning.
00:01:08.026,00:01:10.862,I had a fairly standard childhood.
00:01:11.572,00:01:14.783,I came from what you might call a broken home.
00:01:17.911,00:01:21.206,I was eight days old and still living with my parents.
00:01:24.084,00:01:25.752,"Clearly, it was time to move on."
00:01:25.836,00:01:28.672,Here is your Minion. He will take care of you.
00:01:46.690,00:01:50.694,Turns out a kid from the Glaupunkt quadrant had the exact same idea.
00:02:06.918,00:02:08.128,was born!
00:02:12.841,00:02:15.260,Could this be what I was destined for?
00:02:22.851,00:02:24.895,Even fate picks its favorites.
00:02:26.229,00:02:27.439,No big deal.
00:02:49.002,00:02:49.920,Can we keep it?
00:02:55.008,00:02:56.051,and wrong.
00:02:56.426,00:03:01.515,"Mr. Goody Two-Shoes, on the other hand, had life handed to him on a silver platter."
00:03:11.358,00:03:14.069,"But I had something far, far greater."
00:03:14.778,00:03:16.571,My amazing intellect!
00:03:16.863,00:03:19.241,A knack for building objects of mayhem.
00:03:29.292,00:03:33.171,I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning...
00:03:33.797,00:03:36.591,at a strange place called shool.
00:03:37.843,00:03:45.517,It was there that I once again He had already amassed a gigantic army of softheaded groupies.
00:03:51.648,00:03:56.278,He bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.
00:04:01.450,00:04:03.493,and win over those mindless drones.
00:04:24.890,00:04:30.687,"Good receives all the praise and adulation, while evil is sent to quiet time in the corner."
00:04:36.193,00:04:38.612,While they were learning The Itsy-Bitsy Spider...
00:04:39.404,00:04:43.784,I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will.
00:04:45.118,00:04:49.873,"Some days, it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world."
00:04:51.249,00:04:55.170,"No matter how hard I tried, I was always the odd man out."
00:04:55.545,00:04:59.382,"The last one picked, the screw-up, the black sheep."
00:05:16.650,00:05:19.194,Wait. Maybe it was.
00:05:20.028,00:05:22.948,Being bad is the one thing I'm good at!
00:05:23.782,00:05:31.289,"Then it hit me. If I was the bad boy, then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all!"
00:05:41.716,00:05:45.804,"And so began an enduring, epic, lifelong career."
00:05:46.054,00:05:48.181,And I loved it!
00:05:49.975,00:05:52.561,Our battles quickly got more elaborate.
00:05:53.144,00:05:54.938,He would win some.
00:05:55.355,00:05:57.399,I would almost win others.
00:05:57.732,00:06:00.110,He took the name Metro Man.
00:06:00.694,00:06:02.779,Defender of Metrocity.
00:06:03.196,00:06:05.448,I decided to pick something a little more humble.
00:06:05.907,00:06:06.950,Megamind!
00:06:07.284,00:06:11.580,Incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy!
00:06:31.766,00:06:32.642,Hey!
00:06:39.232,00:06:42.027,Great news. I'm a changed man and...
00:06:42.235,00:06:45.947,and I'm ready to reenter society as a solid citizen.
00:06:46.239,00:06:48.700,You're a villain! And you'll always be a villain.
00:06:48.783,00:06:51.536,You'll never change. And you'll never leave.
00:06:51.745,00:06:54.289,-You're fun. -You got a present in the mail.
00:06:54.372,00:06:57.167,-Is it a puppy? -From Metro Man.
00:06:57.375,00:07:01.004,To count every second of your 85 life sentences.
00:07:01.296,00:07:04.215,That's funny. Never thought Metro Man was the gloating type.
00:07:04.674,00:07:07.135,"Oh, but he does have nice taste. I think I'll keep it."
00:07:07.636,00:07:09.763,Any chance you could give me the time?
00:07:09.888,00:07:12.849,I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro Man Museum.
00:07:13.683,00:07:16.353,"Oh, no. Looks like you're gonna miss it."
00:07:16.728,00:07:18.688,By several thousand years!
00:07:31.618,00:07:37.207,"It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown, where we're here to honor a beautiful man..."
00:07:37.374,00:07:38.625,Metro Man.
00:07:39.042,00:07:43.380,His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.
00:07:43.880,00:07:51.304,"For years, he's been watching us with his super-vision, saving us with his super-strength and caring for us with his super-heart."
00:07:51.763,00:07:54.432,"Now, it's our turn to give something back."
00:07:54.641,00:07:59.145,"This is Roxanne Ritchi, reporting live from the dedication of the Metro Man Museum."
00:08:02.023,00:08:04.401,that's un-freaking-believable. It's crazy.
00:08:04.484,00:08:06.444,"I wrote that piece myself, Hal."
00:08:06.778,00:08:13.994,"What I was trying to say was, I can't believe that in our modern society they let, like, actual art get onto the news."
00:08:15.745,00:08:17.330,"like, let's just get a coffee or something."
00:08:20.667,00:08:23.878,"Well, if I were Metro Man, Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time."
00:08:26.673,00:08:30.051,And I'd be watching you like a dingo watches a human baby.
00:08:30.176,00:08:31.428,"-Mm. -Okay, that sounded..."
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.763,"-Okay, that sounded a little weird. -A little bit, yeah."
00:08:33.888,00:08:35.849,You're making a weird face and that's making me feel weird.
00:08:37.767,00:08:39.436,...like something watching something intently with love.
00:08:39.686,00:08:42.105,Not love. We're not in love. I'm not saying I love you.
00:08:44.399,00:08:46.026,"I'm in love with you, I'm saying..."
00:08:46.401,00:08:48.820,Roxanne? Roxaroo?
00:09:08.298,00:09:09.507,"Whoa. What are you doing, guys?"
00:09:20.935,00:09:24.397,"-Oh, you fools. He's tricked us. -You were right."
00:09:46.252,00:09:48.588,"Well, hello, good-looking! Need a lift?"
00:09:48.713,00:09:51.174,"Certainly do, you fantastic fish, you!"
00:10:02.811,00:10:04.729,All right. Put your hands in the air!
00:10:10.026,00:10:13.113,Ladies and gentlemen... your Metro Man!
00:10:17.200,00:10:19.744,"Yeah, Metro City!"
00:10:21.996,00:10:24.833,Give me some. Come on. Give it now. Give it to me. Right on!
00:10:25.125,00:10:27.001,Give me the good stuff. All right!
00:10:50.942,00:10:53.153,"You know, I just want to bring it down a bit."
00:10:53.278,00:10:55.321,"Boys, a little lower. Thank you, fellas."
00:10:55.864,00:10:57.448,Let's get real for a moment.
00:10:58.408,00:10:59.784,That's right. That's right.
00:11:01.870,00:11:04.956,Although getting a whole museum is super cool... super cool...
00:11:05.081,00:11:08.126,you wanna know what the greatest honor you've given me is?
00:11:12.547,00:11:16.551,I'll tell you. The greatest honor you've given me is...
00:11:17.135,00:11:20.180,"letting me serve you, the helpless people of Metro City."
00:11:26.352,00:11:29.022,"who would I be, without you?"
00:11:39.699,00:11:44.120,"Ah! I tell you, Minion, there's no place like evil lair."
00:11:48.833,00:11:51.169,"How do I look, Minion? Do I look bad?"
00:11:51.252,00:11:54.881,"-Disgustingly horrifying, sir. -You always know what to say."
00:11:55.131,00:11:57.300,"Oh, the brainbots certainly missed you, sir."
00:11:57.467,00:11:59.761,Did you miss your daddy? Who's a menacing little cyborg?
00:12:02.430,00:12:04.599,"No, no, no, no."
00:12:04.724,00:12:06.851,You want the wrench? Go get the wrench!
00:12:06.976,00:12:09.646,"-Oh, look at that. -Now, back to laughing."
00:12:32.126,00:12:34.170,Miss Ritchi... we meet again.
00:12:34.295,00:12:36.005,Would it kill you to wash the bag?
00:12:36.172,00:12:38.508,"You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi!"
00:12:38.633,00:12:40.426,I'm afraid no one can hear you!
00:12:42.053,00:12:44.097,Wha...? Why isn't she screaming?
00:12:44.430,00:12:46.349,"Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind."
00:12:51.312,00:12:52.814,He's a little better.
00:12:55.900,00:13:01.114,Is there some kind of nerdy supervillain website where you get Tesla coils and blinky dials?
00:13:01.239,00:13:05.243,"Actually, most of it comes from an outlet store in-- Don't answer that."
00:13:08.496,00:13:14.377,She's using her nosy reporter skills on your weak-willed mind to find out all our secrets.
00:13:15.962,00:13:18.006,Such tricks...
00:13:18.589,00:13:20.508,won't work on me...
00:13:20.633,00:13:22.010,-Please talk slower. -...temptress!
00:13:25.847,00:13:28.474,Predictable? Predictable? Oh!
00:13:34.314,00:13:36.441,"Yeah, I was thinking about it on the way over."
00:13:37.358,00:13:38.735,What's this? Boom!
00:13:38.985,00:13:41.070,-In your face. -Clich√©.
00:13:41.154,00:13:44.365,"-No, look, watch! -Juvenile."
00:13:44.449,00:13:46.200,-Shock and awe! -Tacky.
00:13:46.492,00:13:48.369,-Oh! It's so scary! -Seen it.
00:13:48.578,00:13:50.288,-What's this one do? -Garish.
00:13:53.541,00:13:54.751,Spider?
00:13:58.629,00:14:01.924,"Uh, yes! The... the spider."
00:14:02.300,00:14:07.972,Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus will instantly paralyze-- Oh!
00:14:14.729,00:14:26.574,"Let's stop wasting time and call your boyfriend in tights, It is with great pleasure that I present to Metro Man this new museum. If you please!"
00:14:34.332,00:14:36.626,Hey! My kid can't see.
00:14:59.315,00:15:03.319,"-Megamind. -Oh, bravo, Metro Man!"
00:15:05.446,00:15:07.073,Boo!
00:15:07.156,00:15:10.034,"Yes, I can play along, too. Boo!"
00:15:10.118,00:15:12.245,Should have known you'd try to crash the party.
00:15:12.453,00:15:14.705,"Oh, I intend to do more than crash it."
00:15:14.831,00:15:20.336,This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget!
00:15:22.713,00:15:25.675,"Oh, potato, tomato, potato, tomato."
00:15:25.758,00:15:28.678,We all know how this ends... with you behind bars.
00:15:28.845,00:15:33.057,"Oh, I'm shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots."
00:15:33.266,00:15:40.481,You will leave Metrocity or this will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi! Huh?
00:15:42.024,00:15:44.152,"Don't panic, Roxie. I'm on my way."
00:15:44.402,00:15:49.574,"-I'm not panicking. -In order to stop me, you need to find me first, Metro Man."
00:15:51.701,00:15:55.329,"No, we're not! Don't listen to her. She's crazy."
00:16:16.809,00:16:19.061,"Metro Man approaching, sir."
00:16:38.289,00:16:39.665,Hold on a second.
00:16:46.672,00:16:48.758,"Oh, good heavens!"
00:16:49.091,00:16:52.887,"You didn't think you were in the real observatory, did you?"
00:16:58.601,00:17:02.146,"-Ready the death ray, Minion. -Death ray readying."
00:17:09.111,00:17:11.197,you've fallen right into my trap.
00:17:11.364,00:17:14.242,"You can't trap justice. It's an idea, a belief."
00:17:14.492,00:17:17.703,Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time.
00:17:17.787,00:17:19.664,Justice is a non-corrosive metal.
00:17:19.830,00:17:22.041,But metals can be melted by the heat of revange!
00:17:22.166,00:17:24.710,It's revenge and it's best served cold!
00:17:24.794,00:17:27.088,But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil!
00:17:27.171,00:17:29.257,"Well, I think your warranty's about to expire."
00:17:29.340,00:17:30.591,Maybe I got an extended warranty!
00:17:30.675,00:17:33.386,Warranties are invalid if you don't use the product for its intended purpose!
00:17:36.764,00:17:42.895,"Of course. That is, if Metro Man can withstand the full concentrated power of the sun!"
00:17:43.896,00:17:44.897,Fire!
00:17:55.157,00:17:56.742,Minion... fire?
00:17:56.909,00:17:59.328,"-Uh, it's still warming up, sir. -Come again?"
00:17:59.412,00:18:00.788,"-Warming up, sir. -Warming up?"
00:18:00.913,00:18:02.915,The sun is warming up?
00:18:03.082,00:18:05.668,One second more...
00:18:05.835,00:18:07.962,and... just...
00:18:08.129,00:18:11.591,"tippy-tappy, tippy-tap-tap, tip-top more..."
00:18:11.716,00:18:14.468,-Honestly! -...and we are ready in just....
00:18:16.095,00:18:17.346,I told you to have things ready.
00:18:17.555,00:18:19.348,-I told you countless times. -Hang on one second...
00:18:21.267,00:18:23.019,My spider bite is acting up!
00:18:23.185,00:18:25.563,Your plan is failing. Just admit it.
00:18:25.646,00:18:27.106,"Yeah, good luck with that one."
00:18:27.523,00:18:29.734,-Whose side are you on? -The losing side.
00:18:29.859,00:18:39.785,"-Thank you! -Uh, could someone stamp You, of all people, know we discontinued that promotion."
00:18:40.036,00:18:42.163,"-Ciao-ciao, all! -Same time next week?"
00:18:46.959,00:18:49.545,-What did he just say? -Crab nuggets?
00:18:54.800,00:18:56.844,"Good Lord, I'm trapped!"
00:18:56.969,00:18:58.596,What kind of trickery is this?
00:18:58.846,00:19:03.643,You mad genius! Your dark gift has finally paid off!
00:19:03.893,00:19:05.227,It... it has?
00:19:05.561,00:19:09.273,This dome is obviously lined with copper!
00:19:11.484,00:19:14.362,-Sir? -Copper drains my powers!
00:19:47.603,00:19:51.399,"Well, let's not get our hopes up just yet."
00:20:12.503,00:20:15.631,"You... you did it, sir."
00:20:15.798,00:20:16.882,I did it?
00:20:20.845,00:20:21.887,He did it.
00:20:22.263,00:20:23.389,I did it?
00:20:23.931,00:20:25.099,He did it.
00:20:25.391,00:20:26.934,"-You did it, sir! -I did it!"
00:20:27.143,00:20:28.477,-He did it! -I did it!
00:20:28.602,00:20:30.896,Metrocity is mine!
00:20:44.493,00:20:46.495,-I'm gonna be right there next to you. -What awards? Awards for what?
00:20:47.163,00:20:48.247,Hit it!
00:21:49.642,00:21:51.685,"First off, what a turnout!"
00:21:55.773,00:21:59.235,All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.
00:21:59.860,00:22:02.071,Are there any questions? Go on.
00:22:02.279,00:22:03.656,"Yes, you in the back."
00:22:03.989,00:22:08.536,I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city.
00:22:09.078,00:22:10.412,Good. I'm glad you asked that.
00:22:10.621,00:22:16.794,"Imagine the most horrible, terrifying, evil thing you can possibly think of..."
00:22:17.419,00:22:21.006,and multiply it by six!
00:22:25.719,00:22:30.015,"with the dreary, normal things you normal people do!"
00:22:30.558,00:22:34.812,"Let's just have fun with this, come on! And I will get back to you."
00:22:56.208,00:22:59.879,"Oh, Minion, did you think this day would ever come?"
00:23:02.381,00:23:06.510,"Never. Never in a million-- I mean... yes, I did!"
00:23:08.721,00:23:10.639,"I'm looking, I'm looking!"
00:23:11.098,00:23:12.266,And what's this?
00:23:12.975,00:23:16.020,It's like one of the giant monitors in the lair...
00:23:16.812,00:23:18.689,but it seems to only carry one station.
00:23:18.814,00:23:21.817,"Oh, that, sir, is called a window."
00:23:22.109,00:23:24.486,-Window. -All the kids are looking through them.
00:23:24.945,00:23:26.238,Oh...
00:23:26.572,00:23:28.324,I've never had a view before.
00:23:29.116,00:23:31.744,"Metrocity, Minion. It's all mine!"
00:23:33.370,00:23:35.372,If my parents could see me now.
00:23:35.706,00:23:39.501,"Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven."
00:23:40.502,00:23:48.552,"And now that Mr. Goody Two-Shoes is out of the way, I can have everything I want! And there's no one to stop me!"
00:24:34.974,00:24:38.477,"Always thirsty, never satisfied."
00:24:38.894,00:24:41.730,"I understand you, little well-dressed bird."
00:24:42.523,00:24:45.317,Purposeless... emptiness.
00:24:45.943,00:24:49.738,"It's a vacuum, isn't it? It's... What's your vacuum like?"
00:24:53.909,00:24:56.745,"Hey, hey, hey! Not now, Minion!"
00:24:58.872,00:25:03.961,I'm in a heated existential discussion with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.
00:25:06.714,00:25:09.508,"Is... is something wrong, sir?"
00:25:10.592,00:25:12.511,Just think about it.
00:25:12.928,00:25:14.513,We have it all.
00:25:15.889,00:25:17.307,Yet we have nothing.
00:25:19.435,00:25:20.811,It's just too easy now.
00:25:21.979,00:25:23.772,"I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir."
00:25:25.399,00:25:28.318,"I mean... we did it, right?"
00:25:28.444,00:25:32.865,"Uh, well, you did it, sir. Yes, you've made that perfectly clear."
00:25:33.407,00:25:37.453,Then why do I feel so... melon-choly?
00:25:37.703,00:25:40.164,-Melon-choly? -Unhappy.
00:25:42.374,00:25:47.337,"What if, tomorrow, we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi?"
00:25:51.675,00:25:56.096,"Good idea, Minion. But without him, what's the point?"
00:25:56.764,00:25:59.016,"-Him, sir? -Nothing."
00:26:03.187,00:26:07.941,"That's something to consider, and, um, well, I think I'll just power down for a while, then."
00:26:17.618,00:26:19.286,Dependable.
00:26:21.080,00:26:22.581,Perhaps we took him for granted.
00:26:22.831,00:26:27.127,Maybe we never really know how good we have it until it's gone.
00:26:28.212,00:26:30.005,"We miss you, Metro Man."
00:26:30.172,00:26:32.132,I... miss you.
00:26:33.217,00:26:35.594,And I have just one question for Megamind.
00:26:36.220,00:26:37.763,Are you happy now?
00:26:44.686,00:26:48.273,Coming up next: are you ready to be a slave army?
00:26:48.440,00:26:49.817,What you need to know.
00:26:57.908,00:27:00.285,and give it to a child on Christmas!
00:27:00.452,00:27:03.080,"-'Cause we're done. -Okay. See you tomorrow, Hal."
00:27:03.330,00:27:06.542,"Wait. Roxie, I'm having a party at my house."
00:27:06.708,00:27:08.335,"It's gonna be, like, off the hook, or whatever."
00:27:08.669,00:27:13.257,"You should come over. I got a DJ, rented a bouncy house, made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick."
00:27:13.423,00:27:15.217,"Oh, I... I don't know, Hal."
00:27:15.384,00:27:17.344,I don't really feel like being around a bunch of people.
00:27:17.469,00:27:19.805,"No, no, no, that's the best part. It'll just be like you and me."
00:27:21.974,00:27:25.269,"Wow. That, um... that's certainly very tempting, but..."
00:27:25.394,00:27:27.104,I did hire a wedding photographer.
00:27:27.354,00:27:31.191,"That's just in case we were, like, something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it."
00:27:31.316,00:27:32.985,"Like maybe we should have this for, like, ever."
00:27:33.110,00:27:36.071,"-Like a memory, you know? -Um, I'm gonna pass."
00:27:36.238,00:27:39.116,I have some work here that I need to do anyway.
00:27:39.199,00:27:41.493,"Cool. So, Thursday? Soft Thursday?"
00:27:41.577,00:27:43.787,"-Good night, Hal. -That's a soft yes on Thursday."
00:27:47.541,00:27:49.293,Rented a bouncy house?
00:27:49.418,00:27:51.795,Chicks don't like bouncy houses! They like clowns!
00:28:36.590,00:28:38.342,I didn't mean to destroy you.
00:28:38.634,00:28:43.513,"I mean, I meant to destroy you, but I didn't think it would really work."
00:28:46.516,00:28:50.229,"Without you, evil is running rampant through the streets."
00:28:50.646,00:28:54.024,I'm so tired of running rampant through the streets.
00:28:54.608,00:28:58.111,What's the point of being bad when there's no good to try and stop you?
00:29:05.244,00:29:06.495,-Bernard. -Bernard.
00:29:10.332,00:29:11.833,You probably think I'm a little bit nuts.
00:29:12.042,00:29:13.835,I'm not allowed to insult guests directly.
00:29:13.961,00:29:17.005,"Thank you. I just... Bernard, I'll just be another minute."
00:29:18.924,00:29:20.550,-Okay. -Thanks.
00:29:20.842,00:29:24.137,I had so many evil plans in the works.
00:29:24.680,00:29:28.308,The illiteracy beam. Typhoon cheese.
00:29:28.850,00:29:30.143,Robo-sheep.
00:29:39.820,00:29:41.822,So it's good that we have this time now.
00:29:42.614,00:29:44.408,"You know, before I destroy the place."
00:29:46.493,00:29:47.703,too many painful memories.
00:30:06.555,00:30:07.472,Costume?
00:30:07.639,00:30:10.183,Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.
00:30:17.899,00:30:19.318,Hello? Is someone there?
00:30:21.987,00:30:24.197,Hello? Who's there?
00:30:27.492,00:30:31.163,"-It's just you, Bernard. -Oh, yes! It's just me. Bernard."
00:30:33.749,00:30:37.002,"Look, I wouldn't stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds if I were you."
00:30:37.169,00:30:39.046,We're having the walls and ceiling removed.
00:30:39.254,00:30:41.757,"Wow, that sounds like quite the renovation."
00:30:42.049,00:30:44.301,"I guess I'll, um... catch a ride down with you then."
00:30:51.099,00:30:54.478,I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last-minute escapes.
00:30:55.270,00:30:58.023,Yeah. He was really good at those.
00:31:07.074,00:31:11.745,Bernard. I didn't know you had... feelings.
00:31:11.953,00:31:15.123,-Are you okay? -Metro Man's gone.
00:31:15.665,00:31:18.251,Now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.
00:31:18.418,00:31:20.379,"Oh... come on, Bernard."
00:31:20.504,00:31:23.590,"As long as there's evil, good will rise up against it."
00:31:25.050,00:31:27.886,I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind.
00:31:28.011,00:31:33.016,"-You really think so? -Yeah! It's like they say, Heroes aren't born, they're made."
00:31:36.019,00:31:37.354,Heroes can be made.
00:31:37.979,00:31:41.441,That's it! All you need are the right ingredients.
00:31:41.566,00:31:43.652,-Yeah. Bravery. -Yes.
00:31:43.819,00:31:45.070,-Strength. -Of course!
00:31:45.195,00:31:47.072,-Determination. -Imperative!
00:31:47.280,00:31:48.865,And a smidgen of DNA.
00:31:49.116,00:31:51.326,"Oh, with that, anyone can be a hero!"
00:31:58.125,00:32:00.460,Time to put the past behind us.
00:32:05.048,00:32:06.633,I'm genuinely scared right now!
00:32:09.636,00:32:11.680,Create a hero? Wait. What?
00:32:11.847,00:32:14.766,-Why would you do that? -So I have someone to fight.
00:32:15.016,00:32:17.394,"Minion, I'm a villain without a hero."
00:32:17.686,00:32:19.354,A yin with no yang.
00:32:19.438,00:32:24.109,"A bullfighter with no bull to fight. In other words, I have no purpose!"
00:32:24.693,00:32:28.363,"Now, ask me how I'm going to do it. Go on! Ask!"
00:32:32.242,00:32:36.246,"I'm going to give someone, I don't know who yet, Metro Man's powers."
00:32:36.329,00:32:40.250,I'm going to train that someone to become Metrocity's new hero!
00:32:40.417,00:32:47.340,"Over here! Follow! And then, finally, I'm going to fight that hero in an epic battle of good and evil!"
00:32:47.549,00:32:53.555,Which will put everything back the way it was when the world was perfect and rosy!
00:32:53.847,00:32:56.892,"Behold, Minion... Metro Man's cape!"
00:32:57.184,00:32:59.853,Look closely. Tell me what you see.
00:33:03.899,00:33:08.862,From this we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power.
00:33:13.867,00:33:18.788,Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of bad!
00:33:18.914,00:33:21.333,But I'm saying this is a kind of bad that...
00:33:21.458,00:33:27.589,"Okay, you might think is good in your bad perception, but from a good perception, it's just plain bad."
00:33:27.672,00:33:30.258,"Oh, you don't know what's good for bad!"
00:33:30.967,00:33:33.512,"Now, we have just one shot at this."
00:33:33.803,00:33:42.854,"We must find a suitable subject. Someone of noble heart and mind, who puts the welfare of others above their own."
00:33:44.940,00:33:46.816,What on Earth is that?
00:33:46.983,00:33:50.195,"It seems to be emanating from there, sir."
00:33:52.906,00:33:54.491,-Ollo. -It's hello.
00:33:58.203,00:33:59.287,It's Roxanne!
00:34:01.790,00:34:04.167,-Oh. You inspired me too. -Great!
00:34:04.334,00:34:07.420,It's time we stood up to Megamind and show him he can't push us around.
00:34:07.587,00:34:10.006,"Oh, really? She's so cute."
00:34:10.173,00:34:12.425,-I'm already hot on his trail! -Uh-huh.
00:34:12.551,00:34:14.469,-And what gives you that idea? -Uh...
00:34:14.636,00:34:16.638,-I just found his secret hideout! -Sir?
00:34:16.721,00:34:18.723,How did she find my hideout?
00:34:18.807,00:34:22.018,Uh... how did you find his hideout?
00:34:22.310,00:34:26.523,This is the only building in Metro City with a fake observatory on the roof.
00:34:28.817,00:34:31.570,Okay. There's no way she'll find the secret entrance.
00:34:36.700,00:34:38.868,-Minion! -I kept forgetting where it was.
00:34:38.952,00:34:40.412,She'll discover all our secrets!
00:34:45.500,00:34:47.836,"No, I was just yelling at... my mother's urn."
00:34:48.128,00:34:49.588,"Don't do anything, I'll be right there."
00:35:02.934,00:35:05.312,I'm glad you're here. Wait. How did you get here so fast?
00:35:05.520,00:35:09.232,Well... I happened to be speed-walking nearby when you called.
00:35:09.357,00:35:10.609,-In a suit? -Uh-huh.
00:35:10.692,00:35:14.029,It's called formal speed-walking. But that's not important.
00:35:14.195,00:35:16.531,I better take the lead. This way looks exciting.
00:35:16.656,00:35:17.782,No. It says Exit.
00:35:17.866,00:35:20.869,"Uh, which is the abbreviation for exciting, right?"
00:35:23.955,00:35:26.291,-Wow! Just look at this thing! -Wow.
00:35:26.541,00:35:29.878,"You know, I really could use your help -in deciphering all this. -Really?"
00:35:30.003,00:35:32.213,"You're an expert on all things Megamind, right?"
00:35:32.297,00:35:37.135,"-Yes, right. -Together, we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it."
00:35:37.385,00:35:39.971,"-Are you in? -Oh, what fun!"
00:35:40.096,00:35:41.181,That's what I want to hear!
00:35:41.598,00:35:43.475,"Minion, code: Send in the Brainbots."
00:35:43.558,00:35:47.771,"You know, the whole point of a code is-- Oh, code: Just Do It, Minion!"
00:35:53.193,00:35:54.194,Bernard!
00:36:03.078,00:36:06.498,"Bernard? Oh, yes. I'm doing horrible things to that man."
00:36:06.665,00:36:09.125,"I don't want to get into it, but lasers, spikes..."
00:36:16.007,00:36:18.009,-Let him go! Or... -Or what?
00:36:18.134,00:36:20.595,Or I'm gonna find out what this weird-looking gun does.
00:36:20.762,00:36:23.264,No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!
00:36:23.515,00:36:24.724,I'll just go get him.
00:36:27.936,00:36:29.479,His strength is too much!
00:36:32.482,00:36:35.110,"Well, it's really paying off! You're so fit!"
00:36:35.485,00:36:37.112,And strangely charismatic!
00:36:41.241,00:36:43.326,-Are you okay? -I did my best.
00:36:45.370,00:36:47.414,"Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you."
00:36:47.622,00:36:48.748,I got us covered.
00:36:51.626,00:36:54.045,"-Let go, it's mine! -Bernard, run!"
00:36:56.756,00:36:58.550,-You're going to break it! -Give it to me!
00:36:58.675,00:36:59.592,"Oh, no!"
00:37:05.306,00:37:06.307,Roxanne?
00:37:11.312,00:37:13.982,Who on Earth is that?
00:37:26.369,00:37:29.038,Bernard! You were right about that door being exciting.
00:37:37.422,00:37:41.176,"-This'll stop them! Here! -Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?"
00:37:59.486,00:38:01.279,-You were very strong in there. -I know.
00:38:01.404,00:38:04.115,I've never seen anyone but Metro Man stand up to him like that.
00:38:04.282,00:38:06.451,"-What's going on? -Hal, what happened?"
00:38:06.576,00:38:08.077,I think a bee flew up my nose.
00:38:08.369,00:38:20.256,"I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you but like 50 ninjas tried to attack me, so I had to beat them all up, and I did, and they were all like crying and stuff-- -Wow, a brave one, isn't he? -Who are you?"
00:38:20.548,00:38:22.675,"Oh, this is Bernard. He's my partner."
00:38:22.842,00:38:25.220,"-Partner? -Yes, yes, partner."
00:38:25.345,00:38:29.474,"Well, look, partner, I'm her partner. She doesn't know what she's saying."
00:38:29.599,00:38:33.520,"She's been through a traumatic experience-- I better take him home. Thanks again, Bernard."
00:38:40.819,00:38:42.946,I'll call you tomorrow... partner.
00:38:43.530,00:38:49.327,"-Yeah. Okay. I'd like that. -That was weird for everybody, 'cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me."
00:38:51.955,00:38:54.040,Code: Did You Find Out Who It Was?
00:38:54.332,00:38:56.501,Uh? Oh! Oh.
00:38:57.418,00:38:59.254,Code: Get The Car.
00:39:09.180,00:39:10.765,"-Bye! -See you tomorrow, Hal."
00:39:10.932,00:39:13.643,I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.
00:39:14.978,00:39:19.482,Who is this man we've infused with godlike power?
00:39:22.735,00:39:28.658,"Well, sir, his name's Hal Stewart. He's 28-years-old, no criminal record. Actually, no records at all."
00:39:28.783,00:39:30.743,"Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything."
00:39:30.910,00:39:31.911,What just happened?
00:39:31.995,00:39:35.164,"Not yet, Minion. Not yet."
00:39:35.331,00:39:38.334,Could this day get any more fun-tastic?
00:39:38.418,00:39:46.551,"So, I will just go ahead and defuse him since this is clearly a mistake-- No, Minion! There's something much more powerful at work here."
00:39:46.926,00:39:50.179,This is no mistake. It's destiny!
00:39:51.890,00:39:55.935,Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!
00:39:59.480,00:40:01.107,-Am I saying it right? -It's Stewart.
00:40:03.985,00:40:06.321,'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.
00:40:06.529,00:40:09.741,"Oh, look! It's Hal Stewart. Quick, the spray!"
00:40:11.326,00:40:13.620,"-Oops. All out. -Well, use the Forget-Me Stick."
00:40:20.960,00:40:23.504,"No, he doesn't look quite the hero type to me."
00:40:23.671,00:40:25.298,"Oh, you're such a pill, Minion."
00:40:26.382,00:40:28.426,A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.
00:40:30.094,00:40:33.556,-I smell a hero. -I smell something burning.
00:40:33.765,00:40:35.975,I think it's working! Places! Places!
00:40:36.184,00:40:38.102,Places! Places. Places.
00:40:38.561,00:40:39.896,Do you have your disguise?
00:40:46.444,00:40:47.320,What?
00:40:47.779,00:40:49.530,"Oh, you look fantastic."
00:41:03.378,00:41:06.214,-And come to Papa. -What's going on?
00:41:06.673,00:41:08.883,"-Easy, my child. -Who are you?"
00:41:08.967,00:41:16.849,"I sent you to this planet to teach you about justice, honor and nobility. I am your father."
00:41:17.850,00:41:19.978,"So, you're like... my space dad?"
00:41:20.812,00:41:23.731,Yeah. I'm like your space dad.
00:41:24.607,00:41:26.067,And you are... what?
00:41:26.943,00:41:29.612,I'm your space stepmom.
00:41:30.238,00:41:32.240,I had some work done recently.
00:41:32.782,00:41:34.200,Is this some kind of dream?
00:41:34.283,00:41:36.202,This is a dream come true.
00:41:36.411,00:41:39.789,You have been blessed with unfathomable power.
00:41:39.872,00:41:41.874,-What kind of power? -Unfathomable.
00:41:42.000,00:41:44.293,It's un... without fathom.
00:41:45.545,00:41:55.805,Yeah. We've come to guide you on your path to be Metrocity's new hero and battle the super genius of Megamind!
00:41:59.142,00:42:00.977,I know this is a lot to take in.
00:42:01.185,00:42:05.481,It may take months for you to come to grips-- No freakin' way!
00:42:10.862,00:42:12.572,I'm gonna be a hero!
00:42:15.658,00:42:18.619,"See, Minion? He's perfect."
00:42:20.121,00:42:22.206,And... action!
00:42:32.216,00:42:33.676,"Zap, zap, zap!"
00:42:36.971,00:42:39.557,The flames of my evil burn bright.
00:42:39.766,00:42:41.851,Now you say something cool back at me.
00:42:42.018,00:42:44.520,"Look. It doesn't even hurt, don't even feel it."
00:42:44.645,00:42:48.024,"No, no, no! Stomach down, hands up!"
00:42:48.191,00:42:50.026,-Like Metro Man! -Whoa!
00:42:50.234,00:42:52.236,-Watch out. -Wait!
00:42:55.198,00:42:57.617,He's hopeless! Hopeless!
00:42:57.950,00:43:00.661,-Maybe we should change tactics. -You think so?
00:43:02.538,00:43:03.915,They love video games.
00:43:04.040,00:43:06.709,-I could throw a few parts together. -Can't wait.
00:43:06.959,00:43:09.712,LOL. Smiley face.
00:43:09.921,00:43:11.172,"Can't wait for what, sir?"
00:43:12.965,00:43:14.550,That was such a funny story!
00:43:15.301,00:43:17.220,"And brilliantly told, by the way."
00:43:17.470,00:43:18.846,Okay. Now you tell one.
00:43:19.055,00:43:21.307,"Bernard, I never knew you were so funny."
00:43:21.641,00:43:24.060,And I never heard you laugh before.
00:43:24.352,00:43:27.146,"Yeah, it's been a while. Feels pretty good."
00:43:32.568,00:43:33.820,And... action.
00:43:45.498,00:43:48.084,"-You don't get out much, do you? -Oh, what fun!"
00:43:50.461,00:43:52.922,I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.
00:43:53.297,00:43:55.508,It was one of my favorite things to do.
00:43:56.008,00:43:58.678,"Now, look at it. It's a dump."
00:44:05.434,00:44:10.314,"Um, well, we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump now, do we?"
00:44:14.735,00:44:15.903,They're all back!
00:44:16.154,00:44:17.613,But how? Why?
00:44:17.822,00:44:20.116,"Maybe Megamind isn't so bad, after all."
00:44:25.246,00:44:26.455,That's it.
00:44:30.209,00:44:31.836,Whoo-hoo!
00:44:39.594,00:44:41.804,-But I thought you two-- -I know. Everybody did.
00:44:41.971,00:44:44.432,It's just... He was never really my type.
00:44:44.640,00:44:45.766,Really?
00:44:46.309,00:44:48.311,"Okay, now you tell me something."
00:44:48.561,00:44:51.063,Something you've never told anyone.
00:44:51.981,00:44:59.488,"Well, in sh-- school, none of the other kids really liked me."
00:45:00.531,00:45:02.909,I was always the last one picked for everything.
00:45:03.993,00:45:07.038,"Hmm. Well, it's too bad that we didn't go to the same school."
00:45:12.126,00:45:15.713,"Hal, I think you're ready for this."
00:45:20.635,00:45:22.053,You make me laugh.
00:45:22.303,00:45:24.180,It stretches. It's for you.
00:45:25.348,00:45:27.350,"Hey, what's the T stand for?"
00:45:27.516,00:45:28.517,Titan.
00:45:29.101,00:45:31.062,Titan? What's that supposed to mean?
00:45:31.187,00:45:33.773,It was the only name I could trademark.
00:45:34.649,00:45:35.650,Oh.
00:45:35.858,00:45:38.653,"Do you have someone special in your life, Hal?"
00:45:38.986,00:45:45.076,"No, not yet, but there's this really, really good-looking one I've got my eye on, currently."
00:45:49.872,00:45:51.082,That's very good.
00:45:51.791,00:45:55.169,-Romance is very inspiring. -That's what I hear.
00:45:55.336,00:46:00.007,All you have to do is save her and she'll be yours.
00:46:06.472,00:46:09.558,"unsheathe your churro. One, two, three."
00:46:11.227,00:46:16.732,"Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind, and the city will know your name!"
00:46:18.150,00:46:24.824,"The city's parks restored to their original glory, the streets the safest they've been, the banks reopened."
00:46:25.283,00:46:27.159,Has something happened to Megamind?
00:46:27.326,00:46:29.829,Has someone tamed this monster?
00:46:30.288,00:46:37.628,"This is Roxanne Ritchi, cautiously optimistic, Well, you seem in a very good mood tonight, sir."
00:46:37.962,00:46:41.382,"Huh? Oh, yes. How long is this going to take, Minion?"
00:46:41.590,00:46:46.137,"Just a few alterations, sir, and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet!"
00:46:46.262,00:46:47.471,I'm calling it...
00:46:51.976,00:46:54.228,Black Mamba. Perfect. Ooh.
00:46:54.353,00:46:56.856,"Gosh, I am running late. I have to go."
00:46:56.981,00:46:58.858,"What? Where are you going, sir?"
00:46:58.983,00:47:01.360,We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.
00:47:01.444,00:47:03.362,We haven't even tested your big battle suit.
00:47:03.446,00:47:05.114,"You attend to the details, Minion."
00:47:05.197,00:47:07.450,I have to... run a quick errand.
00:47:07.742,00:47:09.243,You don't run errands.
00:47:09.785,00:47:11.370,-What's going on here? -What?
00:47:14.206,00:47:17.460,Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's Pour Homme?
00:47:17.668,00:47:20.921,"It's just my natural musk. Now, where are the car keys?"
00:47:21.088,00:47:23.424,-Ah. -Nuh-uh-uh.
00:47:23.591,00:47:27.178,"This is about Miss Ritchi, isn't it? You're going on a date with her!"
00:47:32.183,00:47:35.478,"Oh, this is bad. This is bad. You've fallen in love with her!"
00:47:35.728,00:47:39.190,"You are forgetting your place, Minion. Now give me the keys."
00:47:41.400,00:47:44.278,What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?
00:47:44.653,00:47:47.907,She will never find out. That's the point of lying.
00:47:49.992,00:47:54.330,"Honestly, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was your first day -of being evil. -No!"
00:47:56.707,00:47:58.542,This has gone far enough!
00:48:03.589,00:48:06.258,"Sir. Sir, please, it's for your own good!"
00:48:06.759,00:48:07.802,"Oh, what do you know?"
00:48:10.429,00:48:13.099,The bad guy doesn't get the girl.
00:48:13.265,00:48:16.018,Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore!
00:48:19.855,00:48:20.898,You heard me!
00:48:23.818,00:48:25.569,"Now, give me the keys!"
00:48:28.823,00:48:31.909,"-is to look after you. -Well, I don't need you to look after me!"
00:48:32.159,00:48:34.412,What're you...? What are you saying?
00:48:34.578,00:48:37.039,-You don't need me? -Let me make it clear.
00:48:37.289,00:48:39.166,Code: I Don't Need You.
00:48:39.375,00:48:41.210,You know what? You know what?
00:48:43.587,00:48:46.298,Code: I'll Just Pack My Thing and Go.
00:48:46.424,00:48:47.675,Code: Fine!
00:48:48.008,00:48:49.093,"Code: Fine, back!"
00:48:52.513,00:48:55.266,"-Well, good luck on your date! -I will!"
00:48:55.433,00:48:58.144,-That doesn't even make any sense! -I know!
00:49:29.633,00:49:32.636,"I know I am so close, I can feel it."
00:49:35.055,00:49:38.893,"Okay, okay. I just have to take a step back."
00:49:45.191,00:49:46.358,Wait a minute.
00:49:58.871,00:50:00.164,Titan.
00:50:07.087,00:50:10.341,"I usually just scare criminals. You haven't been naughty, have you?"
00:50:11.133,00:50:13.511,I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.
00:50:13.594,00:50:16.222,-The name's Titan. -Titan?
00:50:16.680,00:50:18.766,Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome.
00:50:18.974,00:50:21.101,What's your name? Just kidding. I know everything about you.
00:50:21.393,00:50:24.104,"Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers."
00:50:24.230,00:50:27.650,"Didn't know what you liked, so I just grabbed, you know, all of them."
00:50:29.610,00:50:31.403,"Okay, you don't like flowers? Okay..."
00:50:31.612,00:50:33.030,-Forget the flowers. -What do you want?
00:50:33.197,00:50:35.741,I thought we could go for a little flight around town.
00:50:36.033,00:50:38.077,-Get to know each other first. -Whoa! Whoa!
00:50:38.285,00:50:40.204,This must be very thrilling for you!
00:50:40.329,00:50:41.455,What do you think you're doing?
00:50:41.622,00:50:43.832,Am I moving too fast? You're probably right.
00:50:43.958,00:50:46.669,I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic.
00:50:48.504,00:50:51.423,Saved you! You are lucky to have such a great hero here.
00:50:55.094,00:50:58.138,"Oh, right, right! Duh. I got you! I got you!"
00:51:03.269,00:51:06.438,"That was a close one! You almost died, but I saved you!"
00:51:14.905,00:51:16.282,"I'm sorry, what were you saying?"
00:51:16.490,00:51:18.617,I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life!
00:51:18.784,00:51:20.202,Put me down right now.
00:51:20.327,00:51:22.871,"Okay, all right. All right. Hold on."
00:51:25.583,00:51:28.586,-Are you crazy? -I suppose I'm a little crazy...
00:51:28.919,00:51:30.087,about you.
00:51:30.254,00:51:32.506,"Who are you, really?"
00:51:32.756,00:51:33.882,"Oh, right."
00:51:34.133,00:51:37.136,"Well, prepare to have your mind blown, little lady."
00:51:38.470,00:51:39.430,Ta-da.
00:51:42.891,00:51:44.893,Now there's nothing keeping us apart.
00:51:45.060,00:51:48.397,"-No, it's not great. -Wow. Our first fight."
00:51:48.522,00:51:51.150,This is so us! We're like an old married couple.
00:51:51.233,00:51:54.278,"Look, there is no us, okay? There will never be an us."
00:51:54.778,00:51:57.114,But... I have powers.
00:51:57.573,00:51:59.491,I have a cape. I'm the good guy.
00:51:59.575,00:52:01.952,"You are a good guy, Hal, but you don't understand."
00:52:05.581,00:52:08.042,-Take a deep breath. Listen to me. -You're supposed to be with me!
00:52:08.167,00:52:10.127,"I'm trying to warn you, Hal."
00:52:40.074,00:52:42.618,Wow! Your hair looks exciting.
00:52:42.743,00:52:45.954,Hmm. Not the only exciting development of the night.
00:52:46.580,00:52:49.750,"Megamind's created a new hero, and I know why."
00:52:51.085,00:52:52.419,It all makes sense now.
00:52:52.711,00:52:54.171,-He missed getting his butt kicked... -Uh-huh.
00:52:54.338,00:52:56.965,...so he created a new hero to kick it for him.
00:53:00.052,00:53:02.680,Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.
00:53:02.805,00:53:05.057,Wow. That's a lot to take in.
00:53:07.351,00:53:08.936,I am extremely boggled.
00:53:09.061,00:53:16.527,"You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of who's kicking whose butt, but in the meantime, let's enjoy each other's company."
00:53:23.117,00:53:28.580,"To Bernard... for being the only normal thing in my crazy, upside-down world."
00:53:29.206,00:53:32.042,To... being normal.
00:53:42.094,00:53:43.971,-Roxanne? -Yes?
00:53:45.889,00:53:47.558,Say I wasn't so normal.
00:53:48.392,00:53:57.067,"Let's say I was bald, and had the complexion of a popular primary color, as a random, nonspecific example."
00:53:57.818,00:54:00.863,-Would you still enjoy my company? -Of course.
00:54:01.029,00:54:03.949,You don't judge a book by its cover or a person from the outside.
00:54:09.538,00:54:11.498,"Well, that seems kind of petty, don't you think?"
00:54:45.741,00:54:48.702,Just a technical glitch! Don't look yet.
00:54:54.166,00:54:55.375,Where were we?
00:54:55.793,00:54:56.752,Ugh!
00:54:58.170,00:54:59.797,"-You. -Now, hold on."
00:55:00.005,00:55:00.923,You!
00:55:25.239,00:55:27.115,What about everything you've just said?
00:55:27.366,00:55:29.576,About judging a book by its cover!
00:55:29.743,00:55:32.746,"Well, let's take a look at the contents, then, shall we?"
00:55:32.913,00:55:34.790,You destroyed Metro Man.
00:55:34.957,00:55:39.920,"You took over the city and then, you actually got me to care about you!"
00:55:43.882,00:55:44.967,Tricking me?
00:55:45.425,00:55:48.220,What could you possibly hope to gain?
00:55:53.183,00:55:56.979,"Wait a minute. Oh, I don't believe this."
00:56:00.732,00:56:03.902,Do you really think that I would ever be with you?
00:56:06.530,00:56:07.739,No.
00:56:40.522,00:56:43.358,"Okay, Minion! You were right!"
00:56:43.734,00:56:46.528,I was... less right!
00:56:47.029,00:56:48.947,We should stick to what we're good at.
00:56:49.406,00:56:50.782,Being bad.
00:56:52.284,00:56:53.243,Minion?
00:57:12.095,00:57:13.013,You there!
00:57:14.640,00:57:15.682,"Yeah, you."
00:57:16.725,00:57:19.561,Bring out the Black Mamba.
00:57:51.551,00:57:55.973,"Okay, Titan. It's time to go down in style!"
00:58:19.162,00:58:23.375,I hear there's a new hero who dares challenge my evil.
00:58:23.542,00:58:26.420,Where is the one they call Titan?
00:58:30.173,00:58:32.968,Challenge me! If you dare!
00:58:55.907,00:58:57.409,"Oh, no, we're gonna crash!"
00:59:00.954,00:59:03.123,This is embarrassing.
00:59:09.755,00:59:20.057,"Of all the inconsiderate, boneheaded, irresponsible, ...unprofessional! That's what this is."
00:59:20.724,00:59:23.060,Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?
00:59:23.268,00:59:25.145,Of course not! He was a pro!
00:59:25.353,00:59:28.356,"Hey, Megamind! You're actually the guy I want to see!"
00:59:28.648,00:59:35.197,"-Also, there's a door here. -Do you have any idea -how long I waited for you? -No, no, no, I totally understand."
00:59:35.405,00:59:37.949,Could you just shut up for one second? I'm trying to beat this level.
00:59:38.492,00:59:40.368,Were you even planning on showing up?
00:59:41.328,00:59:42.496,What's this?
00:59:44.331,00:59:46.750,Where did you get all this stuff?
00:59:48.627,00:59:50.712,"-You stole it! -Pretty cool, right?"
00:59:50.837,00:59:54.174,"-No, no, no. You're a hero! -Being a hero is for losers."
00:59:54.466,00:59:57.219,"It's work, work, work, 24/7, and for what?"
00:59:57.427,01:00:02.307,I only took the gig to get the girl and it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.
01:00:02.432,01:00:04.976,"-Roxanne Ritchi? -Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi."
01:00:05.185,01:00:09.481,I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes at some intellectual dweeb!
01:00:09.731,01:00:11.775,-Oh. -Who needs all that noise?
01:00:12.025,01:00:14.986,That's why I think we should team up.
01:00:15.070,01:00:16.822,You... Wait. What?
01:00:17.030,01:00:21.284,"With my power and your big-headedness, we could rule the city!"
01:00:21.409,01:00:23.995,-You want to team up? -I even drew up some new costume designs.
01:00:24.121,01:00:25.205,-See? -Costume designs?
01:00:27.374,01:00:35.674,"wearing glasses on your costume or something, and since I'm the cool one, I'd have, like, I can't believe you."
01:00:35.966,01:00:42.430,"All your gifts, all your powers, and you squander them for your own personal gain!"
01:00:42.722,01:00:44.224,-Yes! -No!
01:00:44.474,01:00:46.518,I'm the villain! You're the good guy!
01:00:46.810,01:00:49.604,I do something bad and you come and get me.
01:00:54.234,01:00:57.779,"-Space Dad told me-- -Look, I'm your Space Dad!"
01:01:02.951,01:01:05.620,"-You tricked me? -Oh, don't like that, huh?"
01:01:05.787,01:01:06.705,"Well, there's more."
01:01:08.415,01:01:12.127,I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.
01:01:12.419,01:01:16.298,-No... -And we were smooching up a storm!
01:01:18.967,01:01:20.552,"When I get my hands on you, I'm gonna..."
01:01:20.635,01:01:23.388,"Yes, yes, I know! Bring me to justice!"
01:01:28.935,01:01:31.980,Oh! And the hero strikes the first blow!
01:01:32.147,01:01:34.191,But evil returns with a backhand!
01:01:38.862,01:01:39.905,Yes!
01:01:50.874,01:01:53.960,I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement!
01:02:04.471,01:02:06.181,You little blue twerp!
01:02:17.734,01:02:19.527,Thrust! Parry again!
01:02:19.653,01:02:23.031,Now it's time for some witty back-and-forth banter!
01:02:25.200,01:02:27.744,"Okay! Look, I'm not sure where to go with that!"
01:02:37.128,01:02:39.798,This one's for Space Dad making a fool out of me!
01:02:47.347,01:02:50.850,"And, Megamind, this one's for Space Stepmom!"
01:02:51.017,01:02:53.645,-You lied to her! -Oh! Well done.
01:02:53.770,01:02:56.439,"I thought that battle went really, really well."
01:02:56.564,01:02:58.733,"-I mean, I have a few notes. -Notes?"
01:03:00.902,01:03:04.030,"Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking more like the morgue."
01:03:04.322,01:03:06.032,"-You're dead! -Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:03:06.241,01:03:08.535,-This isn't how you play the game. -Game over.
01:03:22.841,01:03:23.925,I'm calling time out!
01:03:24.676,01:03:27.095,"Time out? Time out, time out!"
01:03:47.407,01:03:51.453,"Guess what, Buster Brown? It's made from copper."
01:03:51.661,01:03:53.330,You're powerless against it.
01:03:53.580,01:03:57.792,It's the very same metal used to defeat... Metro Man?
01:03:58.084,01:04:02.005,You should stop comparing me to Metro Man!
01:04:11.097,01:04:13.641,"You can run, Megamind, but you can't hide!"
01:04:13.850,01:04:15.560,We're saved! We're saved!
01:04:15.935,01:04:17.729,"What's your name, new hero?"
01:04:17.896,01:04:18.855,It's Titan.
01:04:18.938,01:04:22.359,"Thank you, thank you. Titan has freed us!"
01:04:22.776,01:04:27.113,"Oh, I wouldn't say free. More like under new management."
01:04:33.995,01:04:35.246,Titan's turned evil.
01:04:35.413,01:04:38.416,Congratulations. Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you.
01:04:38.583,01:04:40.710,And why did my doorman let you up?
01:04:43.254,01:04:46.424,"Please, Roxanne, no! No... I need your help."
01:04:46.633,01:04:48.468,Why do you need my help?
01:04:50.470,01:04:52.722,Because you're the smartest person I know.
01:04:55.600,01:04:57.977,The copper should have worked. Why didn't the copper work?
01:04:58.144,01:04:59.729,The copper worked perfectly well last time.
01:04:59.896,01:05:01.689,Copper? You're not making any sense.
01:05:01.815,01:05:05.402,"Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness, he'll destroy the whole city."
01:05:08.071,01:05:10.949,-Okay. How can I help? -We need to find answers.
01:05:11.199,01:05:13.910,You knew Metro Man best. Did he have a hideout?
01:05:14.119,01:05:16.996,A cave? A solitary fortress of some kind?
01:05:17.288,01:05:18.998,Anything that would give us clues.
01:05:19.541,01:05:22.377,"Well, there is one place I know."
01:05:24.629,01:05:27.715,You gave him these powers. Can't you just take them away?
01:05:27.799,01:05:32.554,I can't. I lost my defuser gun when I misplaced the invisible car.
01:05:32.971,01:05:37.475,The night you dumped me. Alone. In the rain.
01:05:38.893,01:05:40.478,-Did you ever look back? -No!
01:05:43.273,01:05:44.732,Whoops. I guess we're here.
01:05:47.485,01:05:50.321,"So, this is where he hid it."
01:05:50.572,01:05:54.826,After all these years. My old shoolhouse.
01:05:57.245,01:06:00.457,"You know, there's an apology in order for the other night."
01:06:00.665,01:06:02.542,"Okay, that would be nice, but make it quick."
01:06:02.667,01:06:04.711,We have much more pressing matters to deal with.
01:06:10.884,01:06:13.344,I can't believe he kept all this stuff.
01:06:16.306,01:06:17.765,Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?
01:06:17.891,01:06:19.642,"Yes, of course, right, focused."
01:06:21.227,01:06:23.021,Hey! Come over and look at this.
01:06:27.317,01:06:28.359,Um...
01:06:28.651,01:06:32.363,Look. This glass has ice cubes in it.
01:06:32.530,01:06:34.699,"Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold."
01:06:34.866,01:06:40.705,"No, what I'm saying is, don't you think it's a little odd that the ice hasn't melted yet?"
01:06:40.872,01:06:42.290,One of life's great mysteries.
01:07:04.187,01:07:07.815,"Titan, first thought to be the city's new hero, has turned evil."
01:07:07.982,01:07:10.568,The city has never seen this level of destruction.
01:07:10.985,01:07:13.154,If only Metro Man were still alive.
01:07:19.577,01:07:21.579,-You were dead. -Are you a ghost?
01:07:26.125,01:07:27.794,"Speak, apparition."
01:07:38.096,01:07:40.348,"Okay, okay, okay."
01:07:40.598,01:07:42.141,You both deserve the truth.
01:07:42.725,01:07:44.852,It all started back at the observatory.
01:07:45.645,01:07:48.565,Roxanne was kidnapped. I was gonna stop you.
01:07:49.566,01:07:51.442,My head wasn't in the game that day.
01:07:51.985,01:07:54.028,We were kind of going through the motions.
01:07:54.320,01:07:55.363,So...
01:07:56.656,01:07:59.701,"using my super speed, I decided to go clear my head."
01:08:03.621,01:08:07.458,we had done the same silly charade our entire lives.
01:08:08.668,01:08:10.878,I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.
01:08:11.337,01:08:13.298,But I just felt stuck.
01:08:14.173,01:08:17.594,"I began to realize, despite all my powers..."
01:08:18.553,01:08:22.932,each and every citizen of Metro had something I didn't. A choice.
01:08:24.142,01:08:28.146,"Ever since I can remember, I've always had to be what the city wanted me to be."
01:08:29.147,01:08:31.232,But what about what I wanted to do?
01:08:32.233,01:08:33.651,Then it suddenly hit me.
01:08:38.114,01:08:40.074,I can be whatever I wanna be!
01:08:40.617,01:08:42.952,No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig.
01:08:43.911,01:08:45.455,"You can't just quit, either."
01:08:46.331,01:08:48.333,That's when I got the brilliant idea...
01:08:49.834,01:08:50.877,to fake my death.
01:08:51.502,01:08:54.589,Copper drains my powers!
01:08:54.672,01:08:55.923,Your weakness is copper?
01:08:57.425,01:08:58.885,Once your death ray hit...
01:08:59.719,01:09:01.804,I've never felt so alive.
01:09:02.555,01:09:04.724,"So, I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school."
01:09:04.974,01:09:08.144,Metro Man was finally dead!
01:09:08.645,01:09:10.980,-And Music Man was born! -Music Man?
01:09:11.105,01:09:12.190,That way I could keep my logo.
01:09:12.273,01:09:13.441,-'Cause wha...? -Come again?
01:09:13.524,01:09:20.990,I was finally free to get in touch with my true power: Check this out.
01:09:28.164,01:09:30.625,"-You're horrible! -Granted, you have talent."
01:09:30.833,01:09:34.087,But there's a madman out there destroying our... your city!
01:09:41.969,01:09:44.889,You left us in the hands of... him! No offense.
01:09:44.972,01:09:48.267,"No, I'm with you. Look, we need your help."
01:09:48.643,01:09:51.145,I'm sorry. I really am.
01:09:51.312,01:09:53.314,Um... I'm-- I'm done.
01:09:53.564,01:09:57.360,"You know, little buddy, there's a yin for every yang."
01:09:57.777,01:10:00.780,"If there's bad, good will rise up against it."
01:10:01.823,01:10:04.283,It's taken me a long time to find my calling.
01:10:05.326,01:10:07.745,Now it's about time you find yours.
01:10:15.336,01:10:16.963,We can beat Titan ourselves.
01:10:17.213,01:10:22.760,"I say we go back to the evil lair, grab some ray guns, hold 'em sideways and go all gangsta on him."
01:10:27.306,01:10:30.143,I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day.
01:10:30.351,01:10:34.522,"I don't fly off into the sunset, and I don't get the girl."
01:10:35.440,01:10:36.649,I'm going home.
01:11:11.309,01:11:14.645,Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.
01:11:14.812,01:11:19.233,Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice.
01:11:20.610,01:11:25.740,Authorities have issued a warning to stay out of the downtown area at all costs.
01:11:40.379,01:11:41.547,Hal!
01:11:43.007,01:11:47.512,"Let me guess. After seeing how awesome I am, you've finally come to your senses."
01:11:47.845,01:11:50.640,"-Well, I'm over you. -I've come to stop you, Hal."
01:11:54.018,01:11:56.813,-Report me to death? -I was going to try reasoning with you.
01:11:57.104,01:12:01.108,"You and I, we worked together for a long time. I know you."
01:12:01.317,01:12:04.904,You don't know me. You never took the time to know me.
01:12:05.029,01:12:09.700,"This is the first time we've hung out socially, and it's when I'm about to destroy the city!"
01:12:09.867,01:12:11.410,I want to talk to the real Hal.
01:12:11.536,01:12:18.668,"I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman and eating dip and being a nerd, and being not as scary as the Titan Hal."
01:12:18.751,01:12:20.002,Too late!
01:12:27.051,01:12:28.427,Megamind!
01:12:30.471,01:12:35.017,You and I have some unfinished business. I'll be waiting at Metro Tower.
01:12:35.142,01:12:37.854,"Oh, and just so you don't get cold feet...."
01:12:42.149,01:12:44.527,Call for your hero to come rescue you!
01:12:49.365,01:12:52.702,"but if you are, you can't give up!"
01:12:54.745,01:13:02.003,"The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight, even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning."
01:13:02.295,01:13:04.297,It was your best quality.
01:13:04.964,01:13:07.925,You need to be that guy right now.
01:13:09.552,01:13:11.178,The city needs you.
01:13:13.514,01:13:14.974,I need you.
01:13:18.477,01:13:20.605,Don't keep me waiting.
01:13:24.817,01:13:28.487,"Listen to me, you have to let me go! Titan has to be stopped."
01:13:29.071,01:13:32.283,"Sorry, Megamind. You still have 88 life sentences to go."
01:13:32.742,01:13:34.827,Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.
01:13:35.202,01:13:38.414,Do you want to hear me say it? I'll say it.
01:13:38.831,01:13:42.501,"Here it is, from the blackest part of my heart."
01:13:44.629,01:13:47.673,I am sorry.
01:13:50.843,01:13:52.303,Not buying it.
01:13:54.388,01:13:56.057,I don't blame you.
01:13:57.183,01:13:59.602,I've terrorized this city countless times.
01:14:00.519,01:14:03.147,Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.
01:14:04.690,01:14:06.442,I lied to Roxanne and...
01:14:07.526,01:14:09.278,"my best friend, Minion..."
01:14:10.404,01:14:11.948,I treated like dirt.
01:14:14.533,01:14:16.661,"But, please, don't make this city..."
01:14:18.037,01:14:21.207,don't make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings.
01:14:25.378,01:14:26.837,Apology accepted.
01:14:29.882,01:14:33.552,"Oh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you!"
01:14:34.011,01:14:36.931,What are we waiting for? We'd better get going.
01:14:49.110,01:14:52.863,"Hey, Metro losers. This is Metro Tower."
01:14:53.114,01:14:56.325,They say it's supposed to be a symbol of our city's strength.
01:14:56.450,01:15:01.580,"But for me, it's a reminder of the day this woman ferociously ripped out my heart!"
01:15:20.266,01:15:22.101,"Please, don't do this."
01:15:22.393,01:15:24.603,"I know there's still good in you, Hal."
01:15:24.770,01:15:26.313,"You're so naive, Roxie."
01:15:26.522,01:15:29.442,"You see the good in everybody, even when it's not there."
01:15:29.817,01:15:31.569,You're living a fantasy.
01:15:32.236,01:15:35.281,There is no Easter Bunny. There is no Tooth Fairy.
01:15:35.448,01:15:37.366,And there is no Queen of England.
01:15:37.825,01:15:40.786,This is the real world and you need to wake up!
01:15:56.719,01:15:59.221,This town isn't big enough for two supervillains!
01:15:59.597,01:16:02.224,"Oh, you're a villain, all right."
01:16:02.391,01:16:04.268,Just not a super one!
01:16:04.560,01:16:06.228,Yeah? What's the difference?
01:16:10.399,01:16:11.692,Presentation!
01:16:31.754,01:16:34.882,"-I knew you'd come back. -Well, that made one of us!"
01:17:01.784,01:17:06.247,"-What's the plan? -Well, it mostly involves not dying!"
01:17:06.413,01:17:07.498,I like that plan!
01:17:28.644,01:17:30.271,Go faster! Make this thing go faster!
01:17:32.064,01:17:33.232,I can't control it!
01:17:48.747,01:17:49.748,No.
01:17:52.751,01:17:56.505,"Well, that was easy. Looks like there's only one loose end now!"
01:18:07.516,01:18:10.853,"Please, let's have a little respect for public transportation."
01:18:12.062,01:18:13.355,You came back.
01:18:13.731,01:18:16.650,"You were right, Roxanne. I never should have left."
01:18:16.734,01:18:19.236,"Oh, I... I thought you were dead."
01:18:19.361,01:18:22.489,My death was... greatly exaggerated.
01:18:55.064,01:18:56.941,He's the real hero.
01:19:03.822,01:19:05.115,Megamind.
01:19:06.742,01:19:07.826,Going somewhere?
01:19:17.920,01:19:19.588,"No, not in the face, man, please."
01:19:19.922,01:19:22.883,"If you know what's good for you, Titan, you'll stay out of Metrocity."
01:19:23.217,01:19:24.677,-You got it! -For good!
01:20:02.131,01:20:05.426,But there's only one person I know who calls this town Metrocity.
01:20:15.060,01:20:17.229,"Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh?"
01:20:20.441,01:20:22.276,"Well, you're not gonna be laughing for long!"
01:20:24.528,01:20:27.156,Hey! Remember that night that I dumped you?
01:20:28.324,01:20:31.452,-You're bringing this up now? -I did look back!
01:20:33.537,01:20:34.621,You did?
01:20:35.080,01:20:36.665,-You did? -Yes!
01:20:36.999,01:20:39.460,And you should look back right now!
01:20:50.637,01:20:52.806,This is the last time you make a fool out of me!
01:20:53.307,01:20:55.142,I made you a hero.
01:21:06.195,01:21:07.446,You're so pathetic.
01:21:07.571,01:21:11.033,"No matter what side you're on, you're always the loser."
01:21:11.575,01:21:13.202,There's a benefit to losing.
01:21:13.577,01:21:15.662,You get to learn from your mistakes.
01:21:17.623,01:21:18.707,Huh?
01:21:20.876,01:21:25.172,"Oh, you've got to be kidding me! Minion, if I live, I will kill you."
01:21:35.974,01:21:37.309,Enjoy your flight!
01:21:39.728,01:21:40.771,Megamind!
01:21:52.116,01:21:55.828,"Normally, I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure."
01:21:56.995,01:21:58.330,But not today.
01:21:59.456,01:22:02.376,What can I say? Old habits die hard.
01:22:09.508,01:22:11.593,"Say bye-bye, Roxie."
01:22:16.306,01:22:17.474,Ollo.
01:22:26.358,01:22:29.486,"The thing about bad guys, they always lose!"
01:22:34.408,01:22:37.035,-We did it. You won. -Well...
01:22:37.828,01:22:39.621,I finally had a reason to win.
01:22:40.831,01:22:41.707,You.
01:22:50.632,01:22:51.717,Minion!
01:22:52.342,01:22:53.969,Can't see. It's cold and...
01:22:54.386,01:22:56.305,warm and dark and light.
01:22:56.472,01:22:58.515,"It's me, Minion. I'm right here."
01:22:58.974,01:23:01.727,"We've had a lot of adventures together, you and I."
01:23:06.231,01:23:08.567,"I mean, most of them ended in..."
01:23:09.693,01:23:12.821,"horrible failure, but we won today."
01:23:16.325,01:23:18.619,We did it. Thanks to you.
01:23:19.077,01:23:22.581,Code: We're The Good Guys Now.
01:23:23.415,01:23:26.126,Code: I Guess We Are.
01:23:29.254,01:23:32.549,"I think this is it! I'm going, going far..."
01:23:48.106,01:23:50.609,"-I guess I just needed a swim! -He had you, didn't he?"
01:23:59.201,01:24:00.827,-Fist pump! -You did it!
01:24:01.036,01:24:02.829,"We won, we won, we won!"
01:24:07.251,01:24:11.171,Sorry! Sorry! He's just not used to positive feedback.
01:24:21.306,01:24:24.101,...but the path we choose for ourselves.
01:24:32.442,01:24:34.570,All right. Put your hands in the air!
01:24:49.960,01:24:52.588,"You know, you look pretty good in white."
01:25:00.679,01:25:02.472,"Uh, hey! My kid can't see."
01:25:02.931,01:25:04.474,"Sorry, my friend."
01:25:05.183,01:25:08.812,"Way to go, little buddy. I knew he had it in him."
01:25:12.441,01:25:14.901,Defender of Metro City!
01:25:20.240,01:25:21.408,Hit it!
01:25:40.886,01:25:43.972,I'm bad! I'm bad. That's right.
01:28:31.181,01:28:34.100,"Sir, you really need to empty your pockets more often!"
