00:14:59.666,00:15:01.291,-Of course-- -I don't have a box or papers.
00:15:01.375,00:15:03.500,I don't have either one. What are you talking about?
00:15:06.541,00:15:08.958,"Listen, niggas call niggas out for this, man."
00:15:09.041,00:15:13.666,Of course. If you don't have the box or pap-- You find me one nigga with a KMH watch they call out.

00:15:18.208,00:15:21.208,So how about we move on to the diamonds here?
00:15:21.291,00:15:24.583,"Listen, you got a girl? Why don't you get your girl a treat?"
00:15:30.708,00:15:31.916,"Howard, get the fuck over here."

00:15:38.333,00:15:40.333,-I'm not doing that. -The nigga would have bought one.
00:15:40.416,00:15:42.375,"I told you, you can keep 'em in my safe."
00:15:42.458,00:15:45.500,I don't want you selling 'em out of my showroom. You understand me?
00:15:45.583,00:15:48.791,"Fucking dumbass. Where the fuck am I gonna sell 'em, nigga? On the goddamn street?"
00:15:48.875,00:15:50.916,-That's not my problem. -That ain't your problem?
00:15:51.000,00:15:59.833,"-No-- -That ain't-- He don't like shit in this dusty motherfucking tin-foil filled-- Yes, he does. He's having a fucking ball here. What are you-- What the fuck is he gonna buy? A goddamn Furby, nigga?"

00:16:16.500,00:16:18.500,"Buzz him in, buzz him in now. Now."
00:16:19.875,00:16:23.791,"Oh, my God, is this... This is it! This is it."
00:16:23.875,00:16:24.833,-Hey. -What's up?
00:16:25.833,00:16:27.416,"A package from Fishtonic, where you want this?"
00:16:27.500,00:16:31.375,"Bring it in, go to my office. KG? Don't you dare leave, okay?"
00:16:31.458,00:16:34.500,"What's in this package is gonna blow your mind, KG."
00:16:34.583,00:16:35.791,-Is it heavy? -Yes.

00:17:00.000,00:17:03.458,"-Man, I can't do this anymore, bro. -What happened?"
00:17:03.541,00:17:06.208,"What happened? Your street goons, they attacked me."
00:17:08.041,00:17:13.750,"Listen, Garnett's crew came in here, they took a look around, see these guys, they're like, Who works here? Who doesn't?"
00:17:13.833,00:17:15.708,"Who doesn't, get out. I said, These guys don't work here."
00:17:15.791,00:17:17.708,That was stupid. You shouldn't have said that.
00:17:17.791,00:17:21.916,"These guys grabbed me, dragged me over the counter, ripped my shirt, got me looking like a fool."
00:17:22.000,00:17:25.583,"Here. Take this. That's a Gucci shirt. It's $500, it's brand new."

00:17:27.250,00:17:29.041,-The tag's still on it. -It ain't about the shirt.
00:17:29.125,00:17:32.416,"I gave you eight years of my life, look how you treat me."
00:17:32.500,00:17:34.583,I put in everything into this business.
00:17:34.666,00:17:38.416,"I saved your ass a thousand times. I can't take this place anymore, man."
00:17:38.500,00:17:41.250,I can't deal with your problems every other day.
00:17:41.333,00:17:44.916,There's a lot of people on this block that would love to do business with me.
00:17:45.000,00:17:48.916,"When you see me working with them, you're not gonna like it, gonna be jealous."
00:17:50.791,00:17:53.000,"You're not gonna like it, Howard."
00:17:54.458,00:17:55.750,Howard? Hello.
00:17:57.541,00:17:59.083,"I'm standing here, man."

00:18:04.083,00:18:06.666,You're looking like a fool out here in the Diamond District.
00:18:06.958,00:18:09.083,Looking through fucking fish.
00:18:09.166,00:18:15.375,"Come on, I gave you eight years of my life and you can't even fucking talk to me and look me in the eyes?"
00:18:15.458,00:18:16.916,Man to fucking man?
00:18:17.000,00:18:19.458,"Holy shit, I'm gonna cum."
00:18:20.083,00:18:22.875,"Hey, fuck you, man. I'm finished with this shithole."
00:18:30.500,00:18:33.416,"Hey, yo, KG? KG?"
00:18:34.750,00:18:36.458,"-Yo. Hey. -Howard, Yussi is gone."
00:18:36.541,00:18:37.958,-That's fine with me. -Gone for good.
00:18:38.041,00:18:39.583,Let me get a phone from you.
00:18:39.666,00:18:42.000,"KG, you've gotta come here. All right?"
00:18:42.083,00:18:44.125,-I gotta show you something. -I gotta leave soon.
00:18:44.208,00:18:45.791,-I know. Listen to me. -I gotta get out.
00:18:45.875,00:18:49.458,"Okay, so I'm watching TV like a year ago, all right."
00:18:49.541,00:18:53.291,"I'm watching one of those History Channel shows, trying to learn shit."
00:18:53.375,00:18:54.500,And I stumble...
00:18:54.583,00:18:57.375,-You ever hear of African Jews? -African Jews?
00:18:59.000,00:19:03.375,"-Nigga want everybody to be a Jew. -Check this out, I know, all right?"
00:19:03.458,00:19:05.208,So these are black Jews. All right?
00:19:05.291,00:19:08.875,They're stranded in the middle of Ethiopia. It's deep shit.
00:19:08.958,00:19:10.750,"-Stranded? -Yeah, lookit."
00:19:10.833,00:19:13.791,"They got nothing. They don't got cars, they don't got shit."
00:19:13.875,00:19:17.041,"And I'm watching this, and I'm like, What are these guys wearing?"
00:19:17.125,00:19:19.875,"Look, it's on the Torah there, it's everywhere, right?"
00:19:20.208,00:19:24.375,It's a fuck-- Where do these fucking guys get precious black opals?
00:19:24.458,00:19:26.125,-That's what that is. -It's a black opal?
00:19:26.208,00:19:27.083,I do my research.
00:19:27.166,00:19:30.916,"These guys live near the Welo mines, which primarily is red opal."
00:19:31.000,00:19:32.666,-Which aren't worth shit. -Okay.
00:19:32.750,00:19:36.166,"But these, you can't get your hands on these things, you understand?"
00:19:37.166,00:19:39.875,"So, look. I say to myself, How do I get a hold of these guys?"
00:19:39.958,00:19:43.666,And I've managed to track these guys down. I buy one from 'em.
00:19:47.083,00:19:50.750,That's the rock. That's the rock. That's the stone. I got this.
00:19:53.958,00:19:56.208,"It took me 17 months to get this thing, okay?"
00:19:59.333,00:20:01.500,Go through my loupe. Be careful. That's my best loupe.
00:20:01.583,00:20:02.625,Let's see this...
00:20:07.916,00:20:10.583,-That's history right there. Understand? -How many carats is this?
00:20:10.666,00:20:14.291,"A good, what, 4- 5,000 carats? $3,000 a carat?"
00:20:19.041,00:20:23.375,"They say you can see the whole universe in opals, that's how fucking old they are."
00:20:25.375,00:20:27.458,-That's why I wanted you to see it. -I gotta have this.
00:20:29.250,00:20:32.500,"From stone to stone. Garnet's a stone, you know that."
00:20:33.208,00:20:35.416,That's a million-dollar opal you're holding.
00:20:35.500,00:20:38.125,Straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.
00:20:38.208,00:20:41.458,"I mean, this is old-school Middle-earth shit."
00:20:45.916,00:20:48.416,the dinosaurs fucking stared at this thing.
00:20:48.500,00:20:52.000,It's 110 million years old. At the least.
00:21:01.166,00:21:02.541,I told you not to lean.
00:21:05.166,00:21:08.125,You heard me. I did tell him not to lean. You all right?
00:21:09.791,00:21:12.708,-Give him a napkin. -That's a sign. That's a sign I need this.
00:21:12.791,00:21:14.000,That's what this is.
00:21:18.666,00:21:19.875,That's a sign. I need this.
00:21:19.958,00:21:22.750,"-I need this right here. -I-- Listen, it's not for sale."
00:21:22.833,00:21:24.291,I can't sell it to you.
00:21:24.375,00:21:28.000,"-What do you mean, it's not for sale? -I can't do it. That..."
00:21:31.291,00:21:33.958,Why the fuck would you show me something if I couldn't have it?
00:21:34.041,00:21:35.791,The fuck would you bring this out?
00:21:35.875,00:21:37.916,"I was excited, decided to share it with you."
00:21:38.000,00:21:41.250,Let me hold it for a night then. Let me wear it to the game tomorrow.
00:21:41.333,00:21:46.125,"It would be cool, I'm going to the game, I'll grab it from you, then meet you at Adley's tomorrow morning, first thing."
00:21:46.208,00:21:48.541,"Cool, boom, just like that. It's perfect."
00:21:57.583,00:22:00.541,"I feel like I'ma have 40 or 50 on this, man."
00:22:11.583,00:22:13.000,-makes me feel like I can fly. -Shit.
00:22:15.375,00:22:18.541,You're going to @me at HowieBling.
00:22:32.875,00:22:38.833,I can't just-- -Collateral. Make sure he brings it back. -No. He's good money.
00:22:51.416,00:22:53.791,"All right, listen, you meet me at..."
00:22:59.000,00:23:02.166,"Listen to me, no dicking around. You'll show up, you hear me?"
00:23:02.250,00:23:04.583,"Chill. I'll see you there, motherfucker."
00:23:11.125,00:23:13.500,The earrings. Wait! Bring it out to him.
00:23:19.041,00:23:20.666,"Fucking, I don't know."
00:23:21.958,00:23:25.875,What the fuck-- Who's gonna clean this fucking shit?
00:23:27.458,00:23:28.958,"Eddie boy, what are you doing?"
00:23:30.291,00:23:31.166,"What do you want, Dad?"
00:23:31.250,00:23:34.125,"Look what I got. Look, you're gonna love this. Here, hey."
00:23:36.416,00:23:37.750,Will you leave me alone?
00:23:37.833,00:23:39.750,-What is it? -This is Kevin Garnett's ring.
00:23:39.833,00:23:43.375,"Championship ring, NBA 2008. I knew you'd freak out."
00:23:43.458,00:23:44.375,Sick.
00:23:44.458,00:23:47.250,"-All right, I love you, my boy. -All right, bye."
00:23:51.041,00:23:53.541,Alberto. Came to work.
00:23:57.833,00:24:00.291,"Hey. Break out your tray, where is it? Where is it?"
00:24:00.375,00:24:04.125,"-Got the tray. What you got? -I'd shake your hand, but I know where it's been. Look at this."
00:24:04.208,00:24:07.250,It's Kevin Garnett's 2008 Championship ring.
00:24:10.458,00:24:11.916,You wanna pawn it or sell it?
00:24:12.000,00:24:13.708,"I wanna pawn it, I wanna pawn it."
00:24:13.791,00:24:16.375,-Let me take a look. -I don't know what you're looking for.
00:24:18.833,00:24:20.791,It's single cut. It's not even full cut.
00:24:22.916,00:24:25.333,-...about the way they cut their shit. -But they're worth less.
00:24:25.416,00:24:27.208,Take a look at this. All right?
00:24:31.125,00:24:33.250,I hear you. So what do you need for it?
00:24:33.333,00:24:36.625,I figure that thing's worth 80 grand?
00:24:36.708,00:24:39.458,Just loan it to me. That's it. Float it to me. I'll be back Friday.
00:24:39.541,00:24:41.750,"Number one, we both know what's in here."
00:24:41.833,00:24:44.666,We both know the value is mostly 'cause it's memorabilia.
00:24:44.750,00:24:46.000,It is a memorabilia piece.
00:24:49.875,00:24:51.666,Give me 50 Gs. Just float it to me.
00:24:51.750,00:24:55.500,"I'm gonna give you $25,000, but I want an 8% vig on the ring."
00:24:55.583,00:24:58.000,Eight percent? Fucking-- How about I give you a grand?
00:24:58.083,00:25:00.833,You can take a grand off the top. I'm gonna come back Friday for it.
00:25:00.916,00:25:02.750,"Last time, you left something here for six months."
00:25:02.833,00:25:03.875,We wanna make sure up front.
00:25:03.958,00:25:06.541,Last time wasn't my fault. We fucking went over that.
00:25:06.625,00:25:13.250,"I understand. Let's make it quick. $21,000, 7% vig, and I want you to know, you say you'll be back Friday."
00:25:13.333,00:25:14.750,"If you're not back Friday, it's my ring."
00:25:35.666,00:25:39.500,Just walking. Now he's stopping. He's slowing down.
00:25:46.750,00:25:48.333,"He's playing with something, I can't make it out."
00:25:48.416,00:25:50.500,"I can't see him, his back is to me."
00:25:50.583,00:25:51.833,"He's hunched over, you can't see."
00:25:54.041,00:25:56.875,"Oh! Now, here he goes, here he goes. He's going again."
00:25:56.958,00:25:59.375,"Wait, I just got a text from him."
00:25:59.458,00:26:01.833,-What's he saying? -It's a picture of money.
00:26:01.916,00:26:03.625,"-This fucking prick. -He says, Arno..."
00:26:03.708,00:26:04.875,He's got fucking money.
00:26:04.958,00:26:06.708,...I got your money right here.
00:26:10.333,00:26:13.208,"-Hey, handsome, where's he at? -He's in the back."
00:26:13.291,00:26:14.375,He's in the back.
00:26:19.041,00:26:23.041,Hey. You got him making meatballs in the back? All right.
00:26:25.333,00:26:26.791,"-Gary, sorry. -...you have your eggs."
00:26:26.875,00:26:28.000,No carrots in the Caesar salad.
00:26:28.083,00:26:29.583,What do you want? I already made your bet.
00:26:29.666,00:26:31.291,I know. I gotta change the bet.
00:26:31.375,00:26:35.500,"I got $21,000 here, so you add it onto the 19 grand. $40,000 in all."
00:26:35.583,00:26:37.291,-Scrap the whole bet? -Scrap the whole bet.
00:26:37.375,00:26:41.000,"I wanna make a six-way parlay, Celtics, Sixers game. What's the line out?"
00:26:41.083,00:26:43.875,-Still plus one. -Plus one. I want the Celtics to cover.
00:26:43.958,00:26:47.500,"I want the Celtics halftime, I want Garnett points and rebounds."
00:26:47.583,00:26:48.791,-Garnett blocked shots. -Right.
00:26:48.875,00:26:51.458,Celtics opening tip. Do you take lightning bets?
00:26:51.541,00:26:53.416,"-Yeah, but you don't want any part. -Fine."
00:26:53.500,00:26:56.708,"A thousand dollars a point, okay? Take this, and this is a gift from me."
00:27:00.541,00:27:02.916,"No, no. I already have a Rolex. I don't need your watch."
00:27:03.000,00:27:05.083,It probably fell off a truck anyway. Listen.
00:27:05.166,00:27:07.166,"Garnett this, Garnett that, what do you know?"
00:27:07.250,00:27:08.791,"I don't know, I just know."
00:27:08.875,00:27:11.666,"Well, I'll tell you what I know. It's the dumbest fucking bet I ever heard of."
00:27:12.416,00:27:13.458,I disagree.
00:27:14.833,00:27:15.916,"I disagree, Gary."
00:27:23.958,00:27:24.791,Fuck!
00:27:24.875,00:27:25.916,Who came out of four games...
00:27:26.000,00:27:27.750,Fucking-- That's five fucking steps he took.
00:27:28.750,00:27:30.458,...hitting four of six from three-point range.
00:27:30.541,00:27:31.708,Jesus Christ!
00:27:31.791,00:27:35.000,"Celtics feel that they stole game one at home, if such a thing is possible."
00:27:35.083,00:27:37.208,That's it. Tuck to KG. Finish it.
00:27:40.208,00:27:42.083,"Back him now, back him now."
00:27:42.166,00:27:46.250,Boom! Fuck you. Yes. That's it. That's it.
00:27:46.833,00:27:48.291,That's my man!
00:27:49.250,00:27:50.541,"Go, get up on him."
00:27:51.916,00:27:56.625,"Get up on him. Fucking... Get the fuck up on him, God damn it!"
00:27:56.708,00:27:59.125,"Howard, what are you doing? What are you doing?"
00:27:59.208,00:28:00.916,"Howard, Beni's waiting for you."
00:28:01.000,00:28:02.416,Okay. I'm coming up.
00:28:02.500,00:28:04.583,It's 25 minutes past his bedtime. Go.
00:28:05.208,00:28:06.625,Did he brush his teeth yet?
00:28:06.708,00:28:09.791,Brush his teeth? I've sent you seven texts in the dark.
00:28:10.666,00:28:12.125,-Howard! -Yeah.
00:28:12.208,00:28:13.500,It's the first quarter.
00:28:14.000,00:28:16.833,That guy was in my shop earlier today.
00:28:17.458,00:28:19.083,Look at him. Soft touch.
00:28:19.166,00:28:22.625,-Hit that shit. Boom! -I don't care. Say goodnight to your son.
00:28:22.708,00:28:24.333,...jumpers that got him 29 points.
00:28:24.416,00:28:25.416,Let me get up there.
00:28:25.500,00:28:27.375,...with the fall-away. Basket counts and a foul.
00:28:27.458,00:28:31.166,"I'll be right there. Okay, let me just get to a time-out."
00:28:31.250,00:28:32.333,...Kevin Garnett are gonna be...
00:28:32.416,00:28:34.625,-This fucking ref is ridiculous. -Now!
00:28:34.708,00:28:38.833,"All right! All right, all right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. God fucking damn."
00:28:47.250,00:28:50.250,And Garnett will put it up with four on the shot block...
00:28:51.458,00:28:54.666,"Garnett, vintage game one, for sure."
00:28:54.750,00:28:57.500,Fifteen points on seven for eight from the field.
00:29:01.500,00:29:05.000,"Oh, give me a fucking break. Fuck, you..."
00:29:19.250,00:29:21.291,"I know. Beni's sleeping, keep it down."
00:29:21.375,00:29:22.625,I'm sorry. Just so hyped.
00:29:22.708,00:29:26.083,"NBA's always the last two fucking minutes, so let's calm down."
00:29:28.333,00:29:33.458,"'Bout to win money. Jason's about to pay me 25 bucks for the first half, double it up, last half I'm making 50 bucks."
00:29:33.541,00:29:35.666,Your father bet a lot of money on this one.
00:29:35.750,00:29:37.000,Really? How much?
00:29:37.583,00:29:39.208,-How much? -You don't wanna know.
00:29:39.291,00:29:41.125,"-A lot though, right? -Yes."
00:29:41.750,00:29:43.500,Put that shit in the fucking hole!
00:29:43.583,00:29:45.958,"That's right, go on, you can dunk again."
00:29:46.583,00:29:51.125,Boom. Boom. Boom. All right. Fucking amazing. That's fucking amazing.
00:29:51.208,00:29:52.250,All right?
00:30:00.291,00:30:04.875,"and your bliss and your entrepreneurial thing and Stephanie and Annaliese went, Ooh."
00:30:05.625,00:30:08.125,What would you do if you had two weeks to live?
00:30:08.208,00:30:09.583,"Uh, that's a good question."
00:30:09.666,00:30:13.083,Can you flip-- Can you flip it to ESPN just for one second?
00:30:16.875,00:30:18.375,That's why he's going so crazy up there.
00:30:18.458,00:30:22.625,"Know what? I'm tempted to wrangle the kids downstairs right now, and get it over with."
00:30:23.416,00:30:27.375,You really wanna do that? I don't know how sensitive that is.
00:30:27.458,00:30:29.166,"Oh, you're calling me insensitive?"
00:30:29.250,00:30:32.458,Thought we both agreed that we wait till after Passover?
00:30:32.541,00:30:34.791,"Next, you'll be saying you wanna wait until after the summer."
00:30:34.875,00:30:37.416,"Hey, I'm not opposed to waiting till after summer."

00:45:42.916,00:45:45.791,"All right, listen, I do, I did, I admit it."
00:45:45.875,00:45:50.458,"I... I... I made a bet, and guess what?"
00:45:51.000,00:45:54.500,"Here's the thing, I hit. I hit the bet big."
00:45:57.041,00:45:59.916,"You think I'm stupid, Howard. You and your whole fucking family."
00:46:00.000,00:46:03.291,"I'll call the book now. Get on the phone with him, he'll tell you."
00:46:03.375,00:46:05.666,I saw the bookie. You're talking about Gary?
00:46:05.750,00:46:07.458,You spoke to Gary about what?
00:46:07.541,00:46:08.958,-About what? -About you.
00:46:09.041,00:46:12.291,"About how you're taking my money all over town, placing bets."
00:46:12.375,00:46:15.541,"You know what that does to me, you know how offensive that is to me?"
00:46:16.125,00:46:17.625,What? You stopped the bet?
00:46:19.541,00:46:20.791,"What do you think, asshole?"
00:46:20.875,00:46:22.541,-You stopped the bet? -Shut the fuck up.
00:46:24.125,00:46:29.208,"Congratulations, Arno, you fucked ourselves outta money. You fucked us both."
00:46:30.833,00:46:37.333,"-Take his clothes off. -That fucking-- Hey, what's this? What's this?"
00:46:48.833,00:46:51.291,You're not getting a goddamn...
00:46:51.375,00:46:54.708,I gotta get to the auctioneers next fucking week.
00:46:54.791,00:46:57.041,Give me my glasses. I need my fucking glasses.
00:46:59.416,00:47:01.291,"Pull up up here. Come on, let's go."
00:47:01.375,00:47:04.708,"Let me explain something to you, motherfucker. Monday, I want the money."
00:47:04.791,00:47:07.583,Arno gets the money. All right? I'm not fucking around anymore.
00:47:15.791,00:47:18.375,Get in the fucking car. Get in the fucking car.
00:47:18.458,00:47:21.583,"Arno, Arno. Arno. All right. Arno, listen to me."
00:47:27.583,00:47:28.583,"No, I want the underwear."
00:47:31.541,00:47:34.250,"-Give me your fucking underwear. -No, no, no."
00:47:38.333,00:47:39.916,Let that fucker rot in there.
00:47:40.000,00:47:44.416,"Fuck you, Arno, you cock-sucking motherfucker!"
00:47:47.708,00:47:51.708,"Help. Help, help, help."
00:47:55.416,00:47:56.625,"All right, you fuck."
00:48:01.833,00:48:05.000,Please pick up. Pick up the phone.
00:48:08.458,00:48:09.583,"Come on, come on."
00:48:11.458,00:48:12.500,-Dinah... -What do you want?
00:48:12.583,00:48:15.291,I locked... I locked my keys in the trunk of the car.
00:48:15.375,00:48:18.833,Can you please... Can you come to the parking lot and open it for me?
00:48:25.041,00:48:26.458,Fucking shit.
00:48:39.166,00:48:41.791,It's okay. Thank you. Okay.
00:48:44.166,00:48:47.625,Sorry. I'll meet you right back inside. It's all good now.
00:48:47.708,00:48:49.083,Let me get dressed.
00:49:07.125,00:49:11.458,What could you possibly be looking for in the forest dressed in such thin paper rags?
00:49:13.916,00:49:17.250,lest I fill this basket with roses before the coming of dawn.
00:49:21.416,00:49:24.125,It protects the roses from the snow.
00:49:24.208,00:49:27.166,Go now and fill your basket to your heart's content.
00:49:27.250,00:49:28.291,"Dad, what the fuck?"
00:49:28.375,00:49:30.166,Just watch your fucking sister. It's fine.
00:49:31.791,00:49:35.000,Thank you. Thank you.
00:49:38.541,00:49:44.750,"I know. Every time she speaks, gold coins shall spill forth from her mouth."
00:49:44.833,00:49:46.625,This will be our gift.
00:50:06.333,00:50:07.666,Wow.
00:50:16.166,00:50:17.625,"When I blocked the call, you pick up?"
00:50:17.708,00:50:20.125,"When you know it's me, you don't? What was that all about?"
00:50:21.083,00:50:24.458,"Ah, I knew it was you calling, all right? That's why I picked up."
00:50:24.541,00:50:26.375,"Hey, where is my fucking gem?"
00:50:26.458,00:50:33.041,"Hey, hey, you need to calm down, all right, I just happen to-- Listen, motherfucker. I want my fucking property, you understand me?"
00:50:33.125,00:50:37.041,"Hey, watch your mouth. All right? You're not dealing with some broke-ass nigga."
00:50:37.125,00:50:40.208,"Hey, you fucking put me on that bus ride home."
00:50:40.291,00:50:41.625,You think that was funny?
00:50:41.708,00:50:44.833,What the fuck was that all about? That fucking bus was disgusting.
00:50:44.916,00:50:46.375,"What the fuck you want me to do, huh?"
00:50:46.458,00:50:50.625,"I go into a locker room with your silly ass, it makes me look really fucking suspect."
00:50:50.708,00:50:51.791,Where's my gem? Where is it?
00:50:51.875,00:50:53.666,"I'm trying to help you, not fuck everything up."
00:50:53.750,00:50:56.166,"Jesus Christ, I have it on me right now."
00:50:56.250,00:50:57.416,You have it on you?
00:50:58.333,00:51:00.333,"Yes, I'm about to be back in the city."
00:51:01.125,00:51:03.916,"Okay, are you going to this fucking Weeknd thing tonight?"
00:51:05.458,00:51:08.750,"I mean, I wasn't planning on it, but I could."
00:51:08.833,00:51:12.083,"You could? No, it's not you could. You will, you'll meet me there."
00:51:30.875,00:51:33.791,"It smells good. What is it, barbecue chicken?"
00:51:39.666,00:51:42.458,"So, I wanted to talk about the trunk scenario."
00:51:47.250,00:51:48.250,Where are you going?
00:51:48.333,00:51:50.375,I'm heading into the city.
00:51:51.375,00:51:53.791,Late night event. Gonna go...
00:51:54.458,00:51:55.291,This a cake?
00:51:55.375,00:51:59.666,"...till 2:00, 3:00, you never know anymore. So I'll be exhausted tomorrow."
00:52:00.250,00:52:01.583,"Yeah, okay, sure."
00:52:10.916,00:52:11.916,Good night.
00:52:14.625,00:52:16.250,"Anyway, I'll finish the conversation later."
00:52:16.333,00:52:19.000,But it was literally so awkward. Like...
00:52:19.083,00:52:20.291,Who are you talking to?
00:52:21.666,00:52:22.958,Jessica.
00:52:23.041,00:52:25.458,"Hi, Jessica. How good was our girl tonight?"
00:52:25.541,00:52:26.791,You can't hear her.
00:52:27.375,00:52:29.958,"Okay, well, then just hang up for a second."
00:52:30.041,00:52:32.833,Let me... Let me talk to you. Two secs.
00:52:32.916,00:52:34.000,I'll call you back.
00:52:35.291,00:52:36.166,What?
00:52:36.250,00:52:40.916,"So, I just, I was very proud of you tonight. You were beyond incredible."
00:52:41.000,00:52:42.833,You told me like five times already.
00:52:42.916,00:52:47.333,"Well, I just wanted... You really, really to know how proud I was."
00:52:47.416,00:52:50.791,"Okay? So I really... I just really, really want you to know."
00:52:50.875,00:52:52.083,"Okay, well, I do."
00:52:54.291,00:52:57.333,"-Everything is cool, right? -What do you mean?"
00:52:57.416,00:53:00.166,"I dunno, I just thought I would check in with you."
00:53:00.250,00:53:01.083,Okay.
00:53:02.000,00:53:03.625,Make sure everything's good.
00:53:04.750,00:53:06.083,Why wouldn't I be good?
00:53:06.166,00:53:08.250,"I don't know, I just thought I'd check in."
00:53:08.333,00:53:11.666,"Okay, well, I literally don't know what you're talking about, so..."
00:53:11.750,00:53:13.541,"That's right, 'cause I'm an idiot."
00:53:14.666,00:53:16.083,So you love me.
00:53:17.125,00:53:18.833,"Okay, I'm gonna get into the city."
00:53:18.916,00:53:21.333,"-Yeah, I'll see you in the morning. -Have fun."
00:53:21.416,00:53:23.166,Like I always do.
00:53:25.000,00:53:27.958,"You know, I have, like, a complete resting bitch face. So..."
00:53:47.875,00:53:52.916,"Demany, wait. I didn't see you out front, I don't fucking see you in here now."
00:53:53.000,00:53:55.416,I can't believe I'm still looking for you.
00:53:56.125,00:53:59.875,"Just, uh, pick up your fucking phone, man."
00:53:59.958,00:54:01.458,I don't understand this.
00:54:02.250,00:54:03.708,You better fucking be here.
00:54:12.750,00:54:14.583,"Yo, someone pass The Weeknd the mic."
00:54:20.125,00:54:23.375,I'm not performing until there's a fucking black light on this fucking stage.
00:54:39.750,00:54:43.125,"black light, black light, black light..."
00:55:00.208,00:55:01.375,Demany.
00:55:03.166,00:55:04.708,Demany. Demany.
00:55:05.708,00:55:08.583,"Howard, look. Hey, I want you to meet my nigga, Jay."
00:55:08.666,00:55:09.875,"Oh, yeah, you the guy."
00:55:09.958,00:55:12.750,"I've been hearing about you. Yo, where's that opal?"
00:55:16.291,00:55:17.625,"Ey, you gonna ice me up?"
00:55:18.291,00:55:19.458,"Yeah, give me the opal."
00:55:20.625,00:55:25.416,"I got you. Come by the shop any time, he'll tell you where. What'd you say? Where is it?"
00:55:25.500,00:55:27.166,I'm sorry. I don't have it.
00:55:27.250,00:55:29.833,"Whoa, whoa, you don't have it? What do you mean?"
00:55:29.916,00:55:31.583,-KG got it. I don't have it. -KG has it?
00:55:31.666,00:55:34.708,What are you talking about? You said on the phone you have it.
00:55:34.791,00:55:37.166,"-Hey, change, I don't want that shit. -That's why I fucking came here."
00:55:37.250,00:55:39.666,Why the fuck are you here if you don't have the opal?
00:55:39.750,00:55:42.583,"Same fucking reason everybody else here, see The fucking Weeknd perform."
00:55:42.666,00:55:44.416,-That is The Weeknd. -You got a problem with that?
00:55:44.500,00:55:47.458,"-I got a very big problem with that, man. -Whoa. Hey, hey."
00:55:50.541,00:55:53.083,What the fuck is wrong with you? Calm your ass down.
00:55:54.083,00:55:55.583,Fuck you think this is?
00:55:58.000,00:56:00.833,-You good? -I'm good. I'm good.
00:56:02.125,00:56:03.583,Give me that fucking drink.
00:56:25.541,00:56:27.541,"-Go fuck yourself. -Hey, fuck you, nigga."
00:57:02.083,00:57:03.500,There's some on your face.
00:57:03.583,00:57:05.125,-I don't even care. -Is it off?
00:57:05.208,00:57:06.291,"Yeah, I got it."
00:57:09.541,00:57:12.083,-What are you doing? -Need to enjoy. What are you doing?
00:57:16.041,00:57:17.666,I wanna fuck you so bad.
00:57:21.041,00:57:22.541,-I'll show you. -Mm-mm.
00:57:26.666,00:57:31.833,"Oh, my God. How are you even this hard right now?"
00:57:35.083,00:57:37.125,"Um, I was already inside."
00:57:37.208,00:57:38.833,"Listen, I don't remember seeing you inside."
00:57:38.916,00:57:40.083,Friends with The Weeknd.
00:57:40.166,00:57:42.208,-He told me to come after his set. -If you're friends with somebody...
00:57:42.291,00:57:43.500,"Hey, Flawless!"
00:57:43.583,00:57:46.708,Watch the yelling. Stop screaming over here.
00:57:46.791,00:57:48.416,Yo! Yo!
00:57:48.500,00:57:51.916,-Yo. Use the phone. -Tell this guy to let me in! Come here!
00:57:54.875,00:57:57.208,"Come here, he's not letting me through."
00:57:57.291,00:58:00.583,"Let him in. Sorry, man. He's with me. Yeah, that's my guy."
00:58:00.666,00:58:04.000,"What's up, sexy? How we doing? Hey, check this out."
00:58:04.083,00:58:06.583,You seen this Rolls Royce that I did? In Miami?
00:58:06.666,00:58:08.958,Yeah. Ritchie showed me that poison shit.
00:58:09.041,00:58:10.666,Where's Julia? She in there?
00:58:10.750,00:58:12.750,"-Yeah, she's back there somewhere. -With who?"
00:58:12.833,00:58:14.666,You know what's going on with my Michael Jackson pendant?
00:58:16.250,00:58:17.458,What do you mean? I need it back.
00:58:17.541,00:58:20.291,-It's in my safe. -I'm coming by tomorrow to pick it up.
00:58:20.375,00:58:22.458,She's helping me sell this thing to The Weeknd.
00:58:27.666,00:58:28.500,Yeah.

00:58:31.875,00:58:32.916,"Where, where, where?"
00:58:33.000,00:58:37.500,"I don't mean to get in your business, I don't wanna get involved, but I saw her go to the bathroom with The Weeknd."
00:58:44.916,00:58:45.791,Julia?
00:58:51.625,00:58:53.083,Shut the fuck up!

01:00:08.333,01:00:11.458,"Listen, Howard. You knew what the fuck it was when you met me."
01:00:11.541,01:00:12.541,-That's right. -Okay?
01:00:12.625,01:00:15.708,"Yeah, that's why I wish I'd never fucking met you. Right here."

01:00:40.625,01:00:43.916,-I didn't fucking do anything with him. -Get the fuck out of here.
01:00:44.000,01:00:45.750,Get the fuck away. Go fuck the guy.

01:01:28.375,01:01:30.041,What the fuck are you looking at?
01:01:32.291,01:01:34.541,"Oh, funny. Stupid bitch."
01:01:35.250,01:01:37.541,That's why you're in line in the fucking cold.
01:03:11.791,01:03:13.250,"-No, listen, Anne. -Howard."
01:03:15.458,01:03:17.500,-You are missing the point. -I'm looking at it right now.
01:03:17.583,01:03:19.125,-It's gorgeous. -It is not you...
01:03:19.208,01:03:21.291,"-It's just... -...who should be looking at it, it's me."
01:03:21.375,01:03:22.541,Turn that down.
01:03:22.625,01:03:24.583,-Let me explain something to you. -What?
01:03:24.666,01:03:27.416,Your opal is one of 75 items I have to open in this auction.
01:03:27.500,01:03:28.375,"Uh... Uh, listen..."
01:03:28.458,01:03:31.666,"All of them but yours have been cleaned, cataloged and appraised."
01:03:31.750,01:03:33.583,"I'm doing some appraisals of my own, okay."
01:03:34.583,01:03:36.125,And then I'm gonna bring it to you today.
01:03:36.208,01:03:38.291,I'm on the precipice of pulling it right now.
01:03:38.375,01:03:39.750,"I swear to you, please."
01:03:39.833,01:03:42.250,-End of the day or we're done. -I'm getting a call right now...
01:03:42.333,01:03:44.583,"-End of the day, Howard, I'm serious. -...so I have to go."
01:03:46.458,01:03:47.458,This is Howard Ratner.
01:03:49.000,01:03:50.125,for calling me back so quickly.
01:03:50.208,01:03:52.541,"Yeah, no problem. That message you left, actually was very disturbing."
01:03:52.625,01:03:54.750,"No, no, I didn't mean to worry you."
01:03:56.875,01:03:59.625,I saw online that your boss represents Kevin Garnett.
01:03:59.708,01:04:01.458,I'm gonna have to put you on hold. One moment.
01:04:01.541,01:04:03.125,"Okay, sure, sure, I'll hang on."
01:04:05.375,01:04:08.583,No. No. Tell her no. I'm not here. Fuck it.
01:04:12.250,01:04:13.250,Where are you?
01:04:15.791,01:04:17.666,I asked you a question. Where are you?
01:04:17.750,01:04:19.708,I stayed at Kat's house. Where else do you think?
01:04:19.791,01:04:21.708,I couldn't fucking go home with you acting that way.
01:04:21.791,01:04:25.750,"No. No. That's... So let me guess, you're not coming to work today?"
01:04:25.833,01:04:26.666,I would like to.
01:04:26.750,01:04:29.708,That must be nice to come to work whenever you feel like it.
01:04:29.791,01:04:30.791,"Oh, Howard."
01:04:30.875,01:04:35.416,"Is that... Is that good? Is that good? Maybe you should take a nap, then."
01:04:35.500,01:04:37.666,"-Take a nap, get your rest. -Can we please talk this out?"
01:04:37.750,01:04:40.416,"-You're being a baby right now. -You need to remain attractive, right?"
01:04:41.958,01:04:43.375,Answer me.
01:04:43.458,01:04:45.541,"I just wanna sit down -and talk to you, Howard. -Okay."
01:04:45.625,01:04:47.208,I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna fight.
01:04:48.958,01:04:51.708,I need to work to make sure that your cheating ass is taken care of.
01:04:56.083,01:04:57.208,This is Howard Ratner.
01:04:59.708,01:05:01.833,"I'm not gonna lie to you, I could be better."
01:05:01.916,01:05:03.500,Sorry to hear that. What can I do for you?
01:05:03.583,01:05:11.541,"I've been having a situation with one of your higher-profile players, and I'm moments away right now from making things very ugly for you."
01:05:11.625,01:05:14.166,"-Okay. Can you hang on for a second? -No, I'm not hanging on."
01:05:14.250,01:05:17.041,-I happen to be a litigious individual. -Mmm.
01:05:17.125,01:05:22.208,"And I am a second away from hanging up right now -and calling my lawyer and the police... -Whoa, whoa."
01:05:24.291,01:05:33.166,"I have no idea what you're talking about, you're starting to sound like an asshole, so maybe you wanna back up-- Kevin."
01:05:37.291,01:05:38.250,-What's up? -Buzz the man in.
01:05:42.708,01:05:46.541,"Buzz the fucking door. Go to the other buzzer, please. Hurry up."
01:05:49.916,01:05:51.500,It's not working. Howard.
01:05:51.583,01:05:53.750,God damn it. God damn it.
01:05:53.833,01:05:55.583,"-Hang on, sorry. -Open this shit up."
01:05:55.666,01:05:56.541,I'm sorry.
01:05:56.625,01:05:58.333,We don't got time for this. He got a game tonight.
01:05:58.416,01:06:01.625,The magnet sometimes doesn't connect. You brought the gem?
01:06:05.166,01:06:08.708,-We're gonna go downstairs and wait. -You can't leave -because that one's locked off. -We'll wait downstairs.
01:06:08.791,01:06:10.291,-Open up. -Get a fucking hammer.
01:06:10.375,01:06:13.000,"-What's going on, man? -Roman. He needs a hammer."
01:06:17.833,01:06:20.791,Move it! Give me the fucking... Give me the hammer.
01:06:20.875,01:06:22.625,I'm on it. I'm coming.
01:06:22.708,01:06:25.375,This usually works. This'll work. Give me this.
01:06:30.500,01:06:32.250,-Shit loud as a bitch. -Are you fucking kidding me?
01:06:33.250,01:06:34.208,Buzz. Hit it from the side...
01:06:38.208,01:06:40.041,"-Oh, my God, Flawless is here? -We ain't got time for this."
01:06:44.708,01:06:45.541,"Oh, shit."
01:06:48.125,01:06:54.083,"Just get me some fucking metal shavings and the tool fucking kit, all right? God damn it."
01:06:55.583,01:06:59.125,"I'm going to get this open, I promise you this will work."
01:07:08.375,01:07:09.750,"I got $175,000 in this bag."
01:07:09.833,01:07:13.208,170... I told you this thing's worth over a million dollars.
01:07:17.833,01:07:20.708,I live in New York. I don't know what that's going to do to me.
01:07:20.791,01:07:23.333,"KG, I wanna give it to you for free."
01:07:23.416,01:07:26.166,"I'm that kinda guy. Just, I'm tied into an auction right now."
01:07:26.250,01:07:27.750,What you talk-- What auction?
01:07:28.750,01:07:30.583,"Listen, make a bid. Make a bid at the auction."
01:07:32.875,01:07:34.708,-Tell him to come-- -Let him rent it a couple nights.
01:07:34.791,01:07:37.125,"I'll hold it till Monday, you get it back Monday night."
01:07:37.208,01:07:38.291,"It's perfect, and you know it."
01:07:40.250,01:07:43.208,This motherfucker says no to everything! Say yes to something!
01:07:43.291,01:07:47.000,"I want to, Kevin. I fucking love you. I feel like an asshole, believe me."
01:07:48.333,01:07:50.083,"Come down, let me fucking do this."
01:07:50.166,01:07:57.083,"Jesus, fucking, I got this. God fucking damn it, Please, stop knocking. It's not gonna help."
01:07:59.000,01:08:00.125,"KG, I'm so goddamn sorry."
01:08:01.750,01:08:04.166,"Got a door don't work. What's going on here, man?"
01:08:04.250,01:08:05.916,"Get them some waters, get the cold waters."
01:08:06.000,01:08:07.083,We don't need any water.
01:08:07.166,01:08:08.791,Go get my ring so I can get up out of here.
01:08:08.875,01:08:10.375,Get him his fucking ring. He got shit to do.
01:08:14.291,01:08:17.958,"The ring. Oh, my God, no. I left the fucking ring in Long Island."
01:08:18.041,01:08:28.208,"What the fuck do you mean you left it in Long-- I don't-- Listen, I can't do this. I don't have confidence."
01:08:28.291,01:08:30.708,"You don't have to do-- I know, but I need the stone."
01:08:32.666,01:08:34.000,Where's my ring at though?
01:08:34.083,01:08:35.541,I'll get you the ring. I'm gonna give it to Demany.
01:08:44.000,01:08:46.541,"-Yo, buzz us out, Howard. -We'll buzz you out."
01:08:48.250,01:08:52.333,"KG, forgive me for everything I did and the time I wasted and you..."
01:08:52.416,01:08:55.208,Fucking asshole. You fucking did this!
01:08:55.291,01:08:57.416,-Yo. -You. What have you been telling him?
01:08:57.500,01:08:59.125,"What the fuck are you talking about, Howard?"
01:08:59.208,01:09:00.583,"Look, this is how this shit works."
01:09:00.666,01:09:04.291,I bring niggas here to you to buy jewelry. That's how I get fucking paid.
01:09:06.416,01:09:08.125,-Fuck are you talking about? -That fiasco you caused.
01:09:08.208,01:09:12.916,"The nigga just offered you a quarter of a million dollars for a fucking rock, dummy. That's all me."
01:09:13.000,01:09:14.375,-My shit. Yes. -'Cause of you?
01:09:14.458,01:09:16.166,-I had nothing to do with it. -That's 20 grand...
01:09:16.250,01:09:19.583,You spoke to those guys in Ethiopia? You put all the calls in?
01:09:19.666,01:09:21.208,"-Yeah, my bad. -Fuck you."
01:09:21.291,01:09:23.125,Taking all my niggas somewhere. Where my shit at?
01:09:28.541,01:09:30.250,-I don't want you in there. -Where's the rest of my shit?
01:09:30.333,01:09:31.666,Where my watches at? There's three.
01:09:31.750,01:09:33.750,-I loaned them. -What do you mean you loaned them?
01:09:35.500,01:09:36.875,"-They're $200. -Nigga, that's my shit."
01:09:36.958,01:09:39.125,"Nigga, them boxes is mad expensive, you fucking idiot."
01:09:39.208,01:09:41.791,"Well, I owe you, then. Get outta there I said."
01:09:41.875,01:09:43.375,"Fuck you, get the fuck off of me, man."
01:09:45.000,01:09:45.833,The fuck is my shit?
01:09:54.083,01:09:55.041,-Is everything okay? -Yeah.
01:09:55.125,01:09:56.791,-Where's the fucking papers? -Shut the fuck up.
01:10:03.166,01:10:06.166,"...the results of your colonoscopy, so we're good. You're all good."
01:10:06.250,01:10:08.041,-Everything came back clean. -Bitch-ass motherfucker.
01:10:08.125,01:10:10.083,"Fuck you and that goddamn phone call, nigga."
01:10:10.166,01:10:12.666,So it's clean 100%? You said it's good?
01:10:12.750,01:10:15.500,"-Yeah, I said you're all clean. -Good. Thank you. That's a relief."
01:10:15.583,01:10:18.708,"-Howard, relax. This is just routine. -You ain't even listening to me, my nigga."
01:10:20.500,01:10:23.500,"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. But you know, given your family history."
01:10:23.583,01:10:25.541,"-I know, I know. -Something you gotta take seriously."
01:10:25.625,01:10:29.250,Jews and colon cancer. What is that? I thought we were the chosen people?
01:10:29.333,01:10:31.708,Colon cancer just paid for my house in the Hamptons.
01:10:32.958,01:10:34.333,What part of the Hamptons? How many acres?
01:10:35.375,01:10:37.291,What are you doing? You're gonna kill the fish.
01:10:37.375,01:10:38.541,What the fuck? My fish.
01:10:38.625,01:10:39.541,Howard?
01:10:39.625,01:10:43.166,"My fish! My fish, you fuck. You get a glass, get a glass."
01:10:43.750,01:10:46.291,"-Fuck them goddamn fish, nigga. -What the fuck are you doing?"

01:10:47.958,01:10:51.083,Get a fucking another glass. Get another glass. God damn it.
01:10:53.333,01:10:55.583,"There you go, there you go. I got you, sweetheart."
01:11:06.750,01:11:08.958,I told you I was coming to you. I'm coming to you.
01:11:09.041,01:11:10.375,-I have the stone. -I have a train.

01:11:18.291,01:11:20.125,"Listen, I got no time to talk."
01:11:20.208,01:11:22.333,I have to be at Adley's in 15 minutes before they close.
01:11:22.416,01:11:23.333,I'll go with you.
01:11:25.041,01:11:25.875,-Please. -That's enough.
01:11:25.958,01:11:27.416,"I'm really sick, I don't feel well."
01:11:27.500,01:11:28.750,I got out of bed to come see you.
01:11:34.750,01:11:37.083,-I want you out. -You motherfucker!
01:11:37.166,01:11:38.833,You're out of the apartment by the end of the day.
01:11:45.750,01:11:47.291,You have no idea with this.
01:12:06.708,01:12:08.000,"Hey. Good Pesach, Howard."
01:12:08.083,01:12:10.791,"All right, Larry. You're a Jew again? Welcome back."
01:12:13.916,01:12:16.125,Have a good Pesach. It's all right.
01:12:33.250,01:12:34.625,Dip the celery?
01:12:49.708,01:12:51.166,Overrated? Chris Paul.
01:13:06.208,01:13:07.625,"Uh, where are we?"
01:13:07.708,01:13:10.500,"Howie, why don't you read the, um, plagues."
01:13:14.041,01:13:14.958,Okay.
01:13:15.041,01:13:18.375,"Uh, Ma, you, uh, take the Hebrew and I'll take the English."
01:13:18.458,01:13:20.000,"Yes, my dear."
01:13:21.083,01:13:21.916,Here we go.
01:13:54.250,01:13:56.416,Hard core back there.
01:13:59.583,01:14:02.375,"You know, watch yourselves, kids."
01:14:07.583,01:14:09.083,"-I don't check this, text me. -Excuse me."
01:14:11.583,01:14:13.791,and then you don't pick up your phone?
01:14:14.875,01:14:17.208,Are you... You fucking with me?
01:14:18.083,01:14:24.833,"I'm trying to have a nice peaceful dinner with my family, which is something you wouldn't understand because you don't have one."
01:14:24.916,01:14:27.500,You wanna play mind games with me? Huh?
01:14:28.541,01:14:34.541,"So whatever you meant by your little link, I meant when I said I want you out of my apartment tonight."
01:14:35.750,01:14:39.458,And I want confirmation by text. Not a link.
01:14:39.541,01:14:42.750,"Via text: Howie, I am gone."
01:14:42.833,01:14:46.041,10:00 pm. Don't you fucking call me.
01:14:52.833,01:14:54.375,"Arno, what the fuck?"
01:14:54.458,01:14:57.166,"Can we just fucking talk? We're family, we're here right now."
01:14:57.250,01:14:58.833,Get outta my way.
01:14:58.916,01:15:01.916,"Yeah? You're not so tough without your friends around, are you?"
01:15:02.500,01:15:06.250,Are you? Are you? Fucking pussy.
01:15:13.416,01:15:14.708,-What about Lin? -That's it.
01:15:14.791,01:15:15.625,We gotta bring back Lin.
01:15:15.708,01:15:18.333,"You know why fucking, uh, Lin's not coming back next year?"
01:15:18.416,01:15:20.375,'Cause Dolan saw everybody was so fucking happy.
01:15:23.500,01:15:26.791,You realize that I met my wife at the first game that started Linsanity.
01:15:26.875,01:15:28.458,-Know what he says to me? -Hmm?
01:15:28.541,01:15:29.666,He comes over to me and says...
01:15:30.625,01:15:32.958,Happy holidays. Like it's Christmas.
01:15:34.000,01:15:35.833,It's like having an intruder in your own home.
01:15:37.500,01:15:40.208,"He's not bothering anybody though, right? He's trying."
01:15:49.125,01:15:50.125,All good.
01:16:07.041,01:16:09.458,That fucking guy tried to steal an opal from me.
01:16:09.541,01:16:10.708,Your opal came?
01:16:10.791,01:16:12.208,"-The opal came, yeah. -Yeah?"
01:16:12.291,01:16:14.875,Yeah. Stupidly I lent it to this motherfucker.
01:16:14.958,01:16:16.541,"No. What do you mean, he took it? He stole it?"
01:16:16.625,01:16:20.625,He didn't steal it. He got carried away. He thinks it has magic powers.
01:16:20.708,01:16:22.083,Magic powers?
01:16:24.000,01:16:25.250,"No, really?"
01:16:27.041,01:16:29.166,"He didn't have it tonight, look how fucking bad he played."
01:16:29.250,01:16:30.541,He wants to own it.
01:16:30.625,01:16:34.541,"So I tell him, Come to the auction, fucking make a bid for it, like everyone else."
01:16:40.541,01:16:45.500,"Well, listen, it's anywhere from 1,000 to $3,000 a carat."
01:16:45.583,01:16:46.583,And it's 600 carats.
01:16:52.916,01:16:54.791,I'm working on that. That's a hard place...
01:16:54.875,01:16:57.333,Who's comparing? Rich is rich.
01:16:57.416,01:17:01.625,"I made a crazy risk, a gamble, and it's about to pay off."
01:17:07.333,01:17:12.250,"Uh-uh-uh. Don't look at us, don't look at him, don't look at me, find it yourself."
01:17:12.333,01:17:13.750,"Come on, keep looking."
01:17:13.833,01:17:16.416,"Now warm, warm, warm, warmer."
01:17:17.708,01:17:19.041,Very warm.
01:17:19.125,01:17:21.000,Keep looking. Keep looking.
01:17:23.250,01:17:24.416,Yeah!
01:17:24.500,01:17:25.458,That's my boy.
01:17:36.958,01:17:40.166,"Dad, look. This is Mom's bat mitzvah dress. It still fits her."
01:17:40.250,01:17:41.375,Let's show Grandpa.
01:17:43.041,01:17:46.083,Hey. It's nine o'clock. What do you think? Shall we get going?
01:17:46.166,01:17:49.125,"-Yeah, let's go tell the boys. -I told them, I told them."
01:17:53.333,01:17:55.041,-What? -Um...
01:17:55.791,01:17:57.958,"-You look gorgeous. -Oh, God."
01:18:00.000,01:18:03.291,I wanted to talk to you for a minute.
01:18:04.083,01:18:06.833,Just sit down and we don't have to do it here.
01:18:06.916,01:18:09.625,"We'll wait, but I, uh..."
01:18:10.875,01:18:14.541,"I'm having very serious second thoughts, and, uh..."
01:18:16.958,01:18:21.166,"we're all together right now, we're all so comfortable. It's..."
01:18:21.750,01:18:24.541,Is it too late? Should we maybe?
01:18:25.583,01:18:27.583,What do you think? Am I crazy?
01:18:27.666,01:18:29.000,Are you serious right now?
01:18:29.083,01:18:31.791,"Yeah. I know, I know I fucked up. I know I did."
01:18:31.875,01:18:35.291,You fucked up. You are a fuck-up. I'm not having this conversation.
01:18:35.375,01:18:38.416,Please stop. Just stop for one second and just look at me.
01:18:38.500,01:18:42.166,Look in my eyes. And they'll tell you what I'm feeling.
01:18:59.541,01:19:02.708,"-What? Tell me, tell me, I wanna... -Oh, my God."
01:19:02.791,01:19:04.000,I know. What?
01:19:04.750,01:19:07.541,Your face is so stupid.
01:19:10.500,01:19:12.250,"Oh, my God."
01:19:12.333,01:19:15.291,I'm gonna leave her. I'll leave her. I don't need her.
01:19:15.375,01:19:16.875,We're done.
01:19:16.958,01:19:18.458,-It's done. -Okay. Okay.
01:19:18.541,01:19:20.541,It was stupid. She's trash.
01:19:21.833,01:19:24.666,She's trash. I know that.
01:19:24.750,01:19:27.416,I was stupid. I'm done. I'm done.
01:19:27.500,01:19:29.250,It means nothing. Meant nothing.
01:19:29.833,01:19:33.916,"Please. I'm begging you, just give me another shot."
01:19:37.125,01:19:40.083,"-You know what, Howard? -Say yes. What?"
01:19:40.666,01:19:44.416,I think you are the most annoying person I have ever met.
01:19:44.500,01:19:47.375,"I hate being with you, I hate looking at you."
01:19:47.458,01:19:51.041,"And if I had my way, I would never see you again."
01:19:51.916,01:19:55.333,That's 'cause you're mad. You're mad and it makes sense.
01:19:56.166,01:19:59.541,"-You can punch me if you want. -Oh, thanks."
01:20:03.125,01:20:04.958,I don't even want to touch you.
01:20:06.458,01:20:07.500,Are you kidding me?
01:20:09.208,01:20:13.083,"Oh, my God, I hate you. Does that fit you right now?"
01:20:13.166,01:20:14.958,-I'm 15 pounds overweight. -I hate you right now.
01:20:15.583,01:20:18.375,I'll get the car. Okay? I'll get the car.
01:20:25.458,01:20:28.500,"Q106.7, The Rock."
01:20:28.583,01:20:33.875,She's always-- Like we wanna see everything she's doing at every moment.
01:20:42.000,01:20:43.375,Why are you taking Lex?
01:20:43.458,01:20:45.583,"Take the tunnel, it's better, less traffic."
01:20:47.708,01:20:51.208,"Plus, I wanna grab something from the apartment, it's right there."
01:20:58.166,01:21:00.625,"Gonna stop by the apartment, guys."
01:21:19.666,01:21:21.791,"-Hi, Mr. Ratner, how are you? -How are you?"
01:21:21.875,01:21:23.000,Anything in the trunk?
01:21:24.750,01:21:27.125,"-I gotta use the bathroom. -Just... hold it in, all right?"
01:21:27.208,01:21:29.041,"-It's 25 minutes, we're home. -I can't wait that long."
01:21:29.125,01:21:31.166,"Don't be ridiculous. Eddie, go upstairs and use the bathroom."
01:21:33.041,01:21:35.625,Couldn't go at Grandpa's? You had to wait till now?
01:21:36.500,01:21:38.958,"Come on. We're going, we're going."
01:21:40.041,01:21:41.291,God damn it.
01:21:42.916,01:21:47.875,"Bathroom's all fucked up because of construction, so I'm gonna ask the neighbor if..."
01:21:47.958,01:21:49.958,"I don't wanna use a neighbor's bathroom, I'm taking a shit."
01:21:50.041,01:21:52.000,-You ever see this show Good Times? -No.
01:21:52.083,01:21:54.458,You're actually gonna like this. This guy was the father on the show.
01:21:59.958,01:22:01.583,He was in Coming to America.
01:22:05.666,01:22:08.125,It's Howard next door. I live in E.
01:22:11.375,01:22:13.500,"-Hey, how are you? -What's up?"
01:22:13.583,01:22:16.750,"Unfortunately, my bathroom's fucked up and this kid's gotta go."
01:22:16.833,01:22:18.166,Can we use yours for a minute?
01:22:19.000,01:22:20.416,No. Sorry.
01:22:23.125,01:22:25.000,"Hey, stop that. He's a fucking legend."
01:22:28.458,01:22:31.458,"Hi. I'm, uh, your neighbor."
01:22:31.541,01:22:32.666,"Hey, how you doing?"
01:22:32.750,01:22:35.541,"How are you? I'm your neighbor, -I never introduced myself. -Alan, how are you?"
01:22:35.625,01:22:39.583,"My bathroom's all fucked up and my son needs to use, can he use yours for a second?"
01:22:39.666,01:22:41.583,"What is it? Number one, number two?"
01:22:41.666,01:22:43.250,-Number one. -He's gonna go one.
01:22:43.333,01:22:45.875,"-So you go quick. -All right, in the back."
01:23:17.291,01:23:21.500,Have a nice life. I hope you find everything you're looking for.
01:23:58.666,01:24:00.750,"Yeah. Hey, I'm coming."
01:24:07.625,01:24:09.125,"Yeah, yeah."
01:24:14.583,01:24:15.791,"Come on, let's go."
01:24:27.208,01:24:29.250,Who's the girl living in your apartment?
01:24:30.083,01:24:31.166,What'd you say?
01:24:31.250,01:24:33.500,That guy told me there's some hot chick living in your apartment.
01:24:33.583,01:24:34.541,Who's that? Mom?
01:24:34.625,01:24:36.166,What are you doing talking to that cokehead?
01:24:36.250,01:24:38.583,-He was talking to me. -I told you to go in and take a shit.
01:24:38.666,01:24:40.333,-I did take a shit. -Get on the elevator.
01:24:40.416,01:24:41.833,It's enough already.
01:24:44.666,01:24:46.500,Don't talk about that to anybody.
01:25:03.791,01:25:05.250,Did you get what you needed?
01:25:05.333,01:25:06.291,Yeah.
01:26:36.750,01:26:38.083,Down here...
01:26:38.916,01:26:40.333,It's a big day.
01:26:42.125,01:26:45.250,Magnolia Bakery from the downtown. Original.
01:26:45.333,01:26:47.500,-You have these yet? Delicious. -Thank you.
01:26:47.583,01:26:50.375,"You tell everybody here, thank you so much for everything they've done for me."
01:26:53.583,01:26:56.416,"And what's this? This is the, uh, catalog for today?"
01:26:56.500,01:26:57.708,That's the one.
01:26:57.791,01:27:01.041,"If they want anybody else to come in, they have to tell me beforehand."
01:27:01.125,01:27:03.166,-Stops right on me. -Thank you.
01:27:08.291,01:27:11.041,What the fuck is this? This is a mistake.
01:27:11.125,01:27:12.625,That's a correction.
01:27:12.708,01:27:15.208,"No, it's a correction, but it's a fucking mistake."
01:27:15.291,01:27:16.916,Where's Anne? I wanna speak with her.
01:27:17.000,01:27:18.458,"I'm sorry, Anne is in a meeting right now."
01:27:18.541,01:27:21.333,No. Get her out of the meeting. It's an emergency. I wanna speak with her.
01:27:22.958,01:27:25.291,"Call her on the phone, please. Thank you."
01:27:27.666,01:27:30.375,-If you promise to keep your voice down. -Jesus. Yes.
01:27:30.458,01:27:31.625,I'm happy to call her.
01:27:31.708,01:27:33.958,Jesus fucking Christ.
01:27:35.041,01:27:37.416,"Hello, Anne? I'm down here with Howard Ratner."
01:27:37.500,01:27:39.875,Ask how this fucking 155 bullshit happened?
01:27:39.958,01:27:42.875,Did you hear that? Mm-hmm. Okay.
01:27:42.958,01:27:45.208,What? What did she say?
01:27:45.291,01:27:48.416,-I'm afraid that's your appraisal. -I know that's what it says.
01:27:48.500,01:27:50.208,I'm asking who came up with the fucking figure?
01:27:51.041,01:27:52.083,Oscar in Gems.
01:27:52.166,01:27:53.833,"Well, Oscar's fucking wrong."
01:27:53.916,01:28:00.125,"I could go out and get six appraisers right now, five of them would say at least $3,000 a carat."
01:28:00.208,01:28:01.458,He can go to six appraisers and...
01:28:01.541,01:28:03.458,"Give me the phone. Can I speak to her, please?"
01:28:03.541,01:28:04.625,Can I speak with her?
01:28:04.708,01:28:06.250,"I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to hand you over."
01:28:08.583,01:28:09.625,-Anne. -Yes.
01:28:09.708,01:28:11.125,This is fucking outrageous.
01:28:11.208,01:28:13.333,"You need to calm yourself down, Mr. Ratner."
01:28:13.416,01:28:17.166,I don't wanna be calm. This appraisal's a fucking joke.
01:28:17.250,01:28:22.541,Oscar happens to be one of our most experienced gemologists -who we were extremely lucky to get. -Knows nothing about colored stones.
01:28:22.625,01:28:25.041,Why the fuck am I hearing about it now? I mean...
01:28:25.125,01:28:32.083,Do I need to remind you that you brought the opal to us on a Friday night for an auction set on a Monday morning? We were lucky to be able -to get it appraised at all. -I don't give a fuck.
01:28:32.166,01:28:33.875,I don't care. It needs to be changed. Do it.
01:28:33.958,01:28:36.041,"Well, that's not an option, but if you like, we can pull it."
01:28:36.125,01:28:39.125,"-Pull it? No. No. Not gonna pull it, okay? -What?"
01:28:39.208,01:28:40.125,Here's what you'll do.
01:28:40.208,01:28:47.333,"You're gonna make an announcement at the top of the auction that the correction was wrong -and the original estimate stands. -No, no, no, no, no."
01:28:47.416,01:28:49.541,We are not correcting a correction.
01:28:49.625,01:28:52.125,"We can either pull it, or carry on as is. It's entirely up to you."
01:28:52.208,01:28:53.416,"Okay, thank you so much."
01:28:53.500,01:28:55.916,"-Okay, Anne. No, I'm sorry, too. -I've bent over backwards for you."
01:28:56.000,01:28:58.583,-We are done here. I've had enough. -That'll be perfect. I'll let her know.
01:28:58.666,01:29:01.208,Let who know? Me and my staff had to work the entire weekend...
01:29:01.291,01:29:02.375,Okay. Thank you so much.
01:29:02.458,01:29:04.416,-I don't care what we make. -From the bottom of my heart...
01:29:04.500,01:29:06.958,-I'm happy I won't have to work with you. -...I apologize. I'll tell her.
01:29:07.041,01:29:08.500,-I can assure you... -Thank you. Okay.
01:29:08.583,01:29:17.250,"So she said that we, uh, need to, uh, take the inserts out of each catalog before the auction starts."
01:29:17.333,01:29:19.083,"So, uh, you have those."
01:29:19.166,01:29:21.416,"If you want, I saw a box down there and I can start on these."
01:29:26.625,01:29:28.833,-What is that? What are you doing? -I have a question for Anne.
01:29:28.916,01:29:31.125,You don't need to call her. I just spoke with her.
01:29:31.208,01:29:32.375,"A separate question, don't worry."
01:29:32.458,01:29:33.458,Howard.
01:29:33.541,01:29:35.125,"Hi, Anne. He's saying you told him it was..."
01:29:35.208,01:29:38.750,"Okay. Hey, listen, just fuck 'em. Put 'em back in, I don't give a shit."
01:29:38.833,01:29:40.708,-Gooey! -We're here.
01:29:43.541,01:29:46.375,"Ah, KG? He is, uh... I didn't see him yet."
01:29:46.458,01:29:48.000,"-Is he here? -I haven't seen him, but I..."
01:29:48.083,01:29:51.375,"-I got all these things for him to sign. -Listen to me, listen. Do you want that?"
01:29:53.666,01:29:55.291,Go to the auction room. See if you can see him.
01:29:55.375,01:29:56.416,Find him in there.
01:29:57.875,01:30:00.750,"-He's excited. -So I wanna ask you a little favor, okay?"
01:30:00.833,01:30:06.000,"-Yeah, what? What favor? -So, um... I need you to jack up the bids."
01:30:07.125,01:30:09.375,"What? No, ab-- No. No, absolutely not."
01:30:09.458,01:30:12.458,"Gooey, a little bit. Here and there, you make a bid for it."
01:30:12.541,01:30:15.083,I just gotta ensure we get it up to $250.
01:30:17.083,01:30:18.416,What if I win at $250?
01:30:18.500,01:30:20.583,That's easy. I'll give it right back to you.
01:30:20.666,01:30:21.791,-But you're not gonna... -Jesus!
01:30:23.250,01:30:26.208,"This is not really a nice position you put me in, you know? I resent this."
01:30:26.291,01:30:27.333,-Think I wanna do this? -Very much.
01:30:27.416,01:30:28.541,I fucked up.
01:30:28.625,01:30:31.958,"I should have got my own appraisal, but I didn't have the time."
01:30:32.041,01:30:33.375,How much did they appraise it for?
01:30:33.458,01:30:34.833,-$200. -$200?
01:30:34.916,01:30:38.916,"-Yeah, but these assholes... -What happened to one point-- ...they don't have an opal specialist."
01:30:39.000,01:30:41.083,-My guy at the AGL says... -$200?
01:30:41.166,01:30:43.416,...$500 just based off the pictures.
01:30:43.500,01:30:46.916,"So, okay, listen. 20%, I'll give you for the winning bid."
01:30:47.000,01:30:48.208,To be a partner with me.
01:30:48.291,01:30:50.958,KG's gonna buy it. It's not a problem.
01:30:51.041,01:30:53.250,This guy's obsessed with the stone.
01:30:53.333,01:30:56.708,Today was supposed to be about Aaron meeting KG. Hmm?
01:30:56.791,01:30:58.208,-Gooey. -To show support.
01:30:58.291,01:30:59.916,That's what today was supposed to be about.
01:31:00.000,01:31:02.750,"Well, this is support, this is support like you've never known."
01:31:06.833,01:31:10.583,"We move on now, ladies and gentlemen, to lot number 38."
01:31:10.666,01:31:13.875,"Lot 38, we have a sale room notice."
01:31:14.666,01:31:28.041,"I'm required to inform you all that this fine Ethiopian black opal presented here before you all on your left, my right, is now offered with a revised estimate of $155 to $225,000 US."
01:31:28.125,01:31:41.708,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a fine piece, a collector's work, and most importantly, it is windowed on either side to reveal the full spectrum of its dazzling color and the pin fire pattern within."
01:31:41.791,01:31:51.041,"So, with that in mind, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues are ready and poised on the phones and you're all ready with your paddles, we shall start the bidding now at $20,000."
01:31:51.125,01:31:53.208,"$20,000, $30,000."
01:31:53.291,01:31:54.666,"Do I have $40,000?"
01:31:54.750,01:31:57.833,"$40,000, gentleman's bid. Pleasure to see you, sir. Thank you, sir."
01:31:57.916,01:32:00.208,"$40,000 now. Do I see 50?"
01:32:00.291,01:32:02.541,"$50,000 now, in a new place. Thank you, sir."
01:32:02.625,01:32:04.208,"Pleasure to have you back, too, sir."
01:32:04.291,01:32:06.916,"$50,000 now against you, sir. Shall we say 60?"
01:32:07.000,01:32:08.250,"$60,000 now against you, sir."
01:32:08.333,01:32:10.375,"$70,000 now against you, sir."
01:32:12.166,01:32:15.250,"One hundred thousand now bid with you, sir."
01:32:15.333,01:32:19.500,"In a great place, a big bold giant leap for a big, bold giant leaper."
01:32:19.583,01:32:20.708,"At $100,000 now."
01:32:20.791,01:32:23.250,"It's no longer yours, sir. It's against you, sir."
01:32:23.333,01:32:24.916,"Gonna try one more, sir?"
01:32:25.000,01:32:26.708,"I'll even break an increment for you, sir."
01:32:26.791,01:32:29.833,"Can I urge you to consider a bid of $105,000, sir?"
01:32:29.916,01:32:31.250,"Come on, sir, you sure?"
01:32:32.208,01:32:35.750,Positive? No further? A defiant nod then.
01:32:35.833,01:32:39.833,"Looking then for 110 in the room. It's $100,000 now."
01:32:39.916,01:32:42.125,"Is there any further bidding? $110,000 now?"
01:32:42.208,01:32:43.583,"Welcome back, sir."
01:32:43.666,01:32:45.583,"$110,000 now. Once again, against you, sir."
01:32:45.666,01:32:48.666,Shall we try 120? 120 now.
01:32:48.750,01:32:50.500,"Try one more, sir? Let's try 130?"
01:32:50.583,01:32:52.750,130 now. Shall we try 140?
01:32:52.833,01:32:54.208,"$140,000 now."
01:32:54.291,01:32:56.916,"Come on, sir, let's up it again to 150."
01:32:57.000,01:33:00.375,"Try one more at $150,000. No longer yours, sir."
01:33:00.458,01:33:02.625,Shall we try 160? 160 now.
01:33:02.708,01:33:04.875,"Back against you again, sir."
01:33:04.958,01:33:07.333,Can we try one more at 170?
01:33:07.416,01:33:08.458,170 now.
01:33:08.541,01:33:11.250,"Say 180? Say 180, sir?"
01:33:16.916,01:33:18.500,"I'm looking for $190,000."
01:33:19.458,01:33:23.083,"$190,000 is bid. Against you, sir."
01:33:32.583,01:33:34.458,Wanna move this up. Any higher? Any further?
01:33:38.958,01:33:41.458,"We have a good bid at $190,000."
01:33:41.541,01:33:43.166,"I'm looking for 200, sir."
01:33:45.250,01:33:47.916,"Gonna move this up. Any higher, any further?"
01:33:49.833,01:33:52.250,"Sure, sir? Last chance."
01:33:55.458,01:33:57.291,"At $190,000, against the phones."
01:34:00.125,01:34:03.041,"Sold to you, sir, at $190,000."
01:34:04.375,01:34:08.625,"Thank you so much. Thank you, sir. Paddle 172."
01:34:16.291,01:34:18.958,-Gooey. I'm so goddamn sorry. -Shh.
01:34:19.541,01:34:21.000,-Thank you very much. -You're welcome.
01:34:21.083,01:34:27.041,"I'm sorry. Listen, I-- 49th Street, I'm supposed to be on 48th Street."
01:34:27.125,01:34:28.291,Thank you. Thank you.
01:34:28.375,01:34:30.583,"It's 190 grand, Howard."
01:34:30.666,01:34:32.708,-190 grand. -That's temporary.
01:34:32.791,01:34:34.416,"Hey, I'm sorry."
01:34:34.500,01:34:37.375,"I gotta tell you, I was gonna stop past 200."
01:34:37.458,01:34:39.083,Did I not tell you that was gonna happen?
01:34:39.166,01:34:40.583,-I'm sorry. -So now what?
01:34:40.666,01:34:44.666,"Your money's gonna go into my account, and I'll wire it right back to you."
01:34:44.750,01:34:46.125,-Like it never happened. -Including 20%?
01:34:46.208,01:34:47.750,Absolutely. That comes right out of my pocket.
01:34:47.833,01:34:49.458,"That is nearly 38 grand, Howard."
01:34:50.916,01:34:53.500,"So I'm gonna need a couple of weeks on that, but it'll be done."
01:34:53.583,01:34:56.166,"-I promise you, okay? -All right. Aaron, let's go."
01:35:07.708,01:35:09.125,Please? Please don't be mad.
01:35:10.833,01:35:13.416,Come on. Can I get the opal? Let me get the opal.
01:35:13.500,01:35:15.750,-What for? -Because I gotta sell that.
01:35:15.833,01:35:17.333,"-Take the fucking opal. -Yes, all right."
01:35:19.125,01:35:21.166,Get 'em going. Open the fucking door.
01:35:21.250,01:35:23.333,What's he waiting for you for?
01:35:24.083,01:35:25.958,Okay. All right.
01:35:28.375,01:35:30.083,"I know, I know, I know. I know."
01:35:30.166,01:35:32.875,"Let 'em go, let 'em go and then we'll talk."
01:35:32.958,01:35:35.125,"-The fuck was that? -All right, I fucked up."
01:35:35.208,01:35:38.666,"I fucked up, it was a mistake, all right? I know. I admit it."
01:35:38.750,01:35:42.625,I gotta just... Let's hit pause for one fucking second.
01:35:42.708,01:35:46.000,Gonna call Kevin 'cause I know he fucking wants it.
01:35:46.083,01:35:51.791,And you saw he's got the 175 and then everything will be copasetic.
01:35:51.875,01:35:52.916,All right?
01:35:53.666,01:35:58.458,KG. It's me. I got great news for you. I-- Hello?
01:36:00.000,01:36:01.208,Hello?
01:36:01.291,01:36:02.958,No one on the fucking phone.
01:36:05.416,01:36:06.291,Shut the fuck up.
01:36:25.000,01:36:26.000,Hey!
01:36:27.541,01:36:29.458,"Arno, Arno."
01:36:29.541,01:36:31.166,"Just listen to me, please."
01:36:31.250,01:36:34.791,"I spoke to Demany, remember Demany?"
01:36:34.875,01:36:38.041,He's a business friend of mine. He gave me the fucking number...
01:36:38.125,01:36:40.833,"That's enough, Howard! That's fucking enough!"
01:36:43.916,01:36:46.625,"All right, fuck you, man. Suck my dick! Throw him in the fucking water."
01:36:48.666,01:36:50.333,"All right, let's get out of here. Let's go."
01:37:03.000,01:37:04.583,Where the fuck are my glasses?
01:37:05.375,01:37:07.375,"My fucking God, where are they?"
01:37:46.041,01:37:47.333,Got the Versace...
01:37:47.416,01:37:50.291,-I don't know if this is a $400 bag. -Mm-hmm.
01:38:25.250,01:38:27.708,-You okay? What's wrong? -I don't... I don't wanna work.
01:38:27.791,01:38:28.708,Send everybody home.
01:38:28.791,01:38:30.208,"All right, sweetie."
01:39:10.583,01:39:12.625,Hey. Sorry to bother you.
01:39:14.791,01:39:16.500,I just wanted to see how the auction went.
01:39:21.000,01:39:27.208,"Well, Damian and Joseph brought this amazing sweat suit that I think would look so nice on you. Do you wanna see it?"
01:39:29.916,01:39:31.291,"Come on, Howard."
01:39:33.666,01:39:35.250,Don't... Don't look at me.
01:39:35.333,01:39:36.625,"Oh, my God, Howard."
01:39:40.125,01:39:41.791,"Don't look at me, please."
01:39:46.250,01:39:47.958,I don't know if I can take it.
01:39:48.041,01:39:50.416,I don't know what everybody's...
01:39:50.500,01:39:52.500,Not ever going right.
01:39:54.041,01:39:57.666,I'm so sad. I'm so fucked up.
01:39:57.750,01:39:59.458,I'm so fucked up.
01:40:05.833,01:40:10.208,"I'm sorry if this is anything to do with me, but I swear, I really didn't do anything."
01:40:10.291,01:40:12.708,I wish you were nicer to me though.
01:40:12.791,01:40:16.041,It was not nice what you did to me.
01:40:16.125,01:40:18.166,"I try, but it's really hard."
01:40:18.250,01:40:20.916,I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
01:40:21.000,01:40:24.750,I don't have any place to go. I don't have anywhere to get better.
01:40:24.833,01:40:26.583,But you do.
01:40:26.666,01:40:31.000,"Like, really, Howard, you're my home. You could come to me."
01:40:31.250,01:40:33.833,"No, I don't-- I can't figure it out."
01:40:34.375,01:40:36.583,I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do.
01:40:36.666,01:40:38.750,Everything I do is not going right.
01:40:38.833,01:40:40.750,Everything I do is not going right.
01:40:40.833,01:40:43.041,I don't know what to do. I really don't.
01:40:43.125,01:40:44.958,-I don't want any more of this shit. -Yeah.
01:40:45.041,01:40:47.458,-I really don't. I gotta figure this out. -Yeah.
01:40:47.541,01:40:49.500,"I gotta figure this out, I really do."
01:40:50.583,01:40:53.750,"Well, I got something if you want. But you can't make fun of me."
01:40:54.333,01:40:55.333,What?
01:40:56.791,01:41:00.208,"My God, it's so stupid, but... I don't know... I got it, I thought..."
01:41:02.583,01:41:04.083,"Look, unzip my skirt."
01:41:06.916,01:41:09.166,"Not like that, just unzip my skirt."
01:41:13.083,01:41:13.958,"It says, Howie."
01:41:14.041,01:41:16.791,What did you do? Why would you do that?
01:41:20.500,01:41:22.583,"-Yes, you are worth it. -I'm not worth it."
01:41:22.666,01:41:25.625,"-Look, Howie, I'm so crazy about you. -I don't deserve this."
01:41:25.708,01:41:27.750,"Yes, you do. I love you."
01:41:29.958,01:41:31.291,You can't even get buried with me now.
01:41:36.458,01:41:38.333,"Oh, this fucking guy."
01:41:39.083,01:41:41.541,Do not let him in. Understand me?
01:41:41.625,01:41:43.416,"Just ignore him. Ignore him, Joani."
01:41:52.791,01:41:54.541,"You don't think it's broken, right?"
01:41:55.916,01:41:58.791,This is crazy. You can't be out here looking like this.
01:42:05.958,01:42:07.291,Can you answer that?
01:42:07.791,01:42:08.625,Hello?
01:42:11.000,01:42:14.041,-I'm actually looking for Howard. -This is Howard.
01:42:14.125,01:42:17.416,"Hi, yes, I got your message from Demany about the gem."
01:42:17.500,01:42:18.916,We're at the bank right now.
01:42:19.000,01:42:22.375,"Oh. Did, uh... So does he want it?"
01:42:22.458,01:42:27.083,"Yes. Kevin's still interested. We could actually be there-- It's like we discussed, right?"
01:42:27.166,01:42:30.708,"It's still, uh... It's still 175, right?"
01:42:30.791,01:42:32.083,-Yes. -In cash.
01:42:32.166,01:42:33.916,"Yes, in cash. Like I said, we're at the bank now."
01:42:36.750,01:42:38.166,"-Howard, I gotta go. -Okay."
01:42:38.250,01:42:39.625,I'll see you soon. Goodbye.
01:42:48.083,01:42:54.416,"Kevin Garnett is coming to my office right now with $175,000 cash. All right?"
01:42:54.500,01:42:56.208,You said I got till Monday.
01:42:56.291,01:43:01.541,"Today is still Monday so I don't know if you're hearing this, but Arno, this is real."
01:43:01.625,01:43:04.583,Kevin's really on the way. He was just at the bank.
01:43:04.666,01:43:06.458,"Come get your money, buddy."
01:43:06.541,01:43:08.083,I need the Celtic ring back.
01:43:08.166,01:43:09.625,-What happened to Friday? -I know.
01:43:09.708,01:43:11.375,"-It's Monday, Howie. -I know what we said."
01:43:11.458,01:43:13.416,-What did we say? -It was a short week. Pesach.
01:43:13.500,01:43:14.958,What happened to your face?
01:43:15.041,01:43:17.625,Car accident. Okay?
01:43:17.708,01:43:18.750,-So let's-- -What do you need?
01:43:20.625,01:43:22.875,and I'm gonna give you the Knicks ring. All right?
01:43:22.958,01:43:25.625,"You know what that means. Swap them out, please."
01:43:25.708,01:43:27.125,You've had this Knicks ring forever.
01:43:27.208,01:43:29.458,I just need the Celtic ring back. All right?
01:43:32.208,01:43:38.875,"-I own that ring right now. -I know, I know you do. And I'm-- So, I'll swap you the two rings but I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one."
01:43:38.958,01:43:42.166,"And if you're not here by Friday, it's gonna be the same thing. Not gonna have a third ring."
01:43:42.250,01:43:43.583,Not gonna have to worry about that.
01:43:43.666,01:43:46.250,"Make it a 16%, I'm sorry I fucked you, all right?"
01:43:46.333,01:43:48.083,"Bubby, what's going on? You okay?"
01:43:48.166,01:43:50.250,I'm very good. Everything's going good.
01:43:50.333,01:43:52.625,-Yeah. -I promise you. I promise you.
01:43:58.041,01:44:00.250,Hey. There he is.
01:44:03.875,01:44:06.833,"I got your chip right here, all right? Game night."
01:44:12.958,01:44:14.791,let's get these guys some Powerades.
01:44:14.875,01:44:16.208,-Powerades? -By the way...
01:44:16.291,01:44:17.833,Water? Anything else?
01:44:19.458,01:44:22.416,"-They're cold, you know that. -Howard, let me get a second."
01:44:32.041,01:44:34.833,"Ever since I met you, you've been giving me the run around with everything."
01:44:34.916,01:44:35.791,What do you mean?
01:44:35.875,01:44:39.500,Feel like you're fucking with my emotions. You're just playing with me at some point.
01:44:39.583,01:44:41.458,This hasn't been straight since I came here.
01:44:41.541,01:44:43.000,-You understand? -Why are you saying that?
01:44:43.083,01:44:45.958,"I borrowed the opal is one thing, I come back over here, I brought it back."
01:44:46.041,01:44:48.375,"I brought it back. I didn't have to bring it back, you understand?"
01:44:48.458,01:44:51.875,"I show up at the auction, you have somebody bid against me, all these fucking games?"
01:44:51.958,01:44:53.458,What the fuck are you doing?
01:44:53.541,01:44:56.125,You don't think I notice? You don't think I know none of this?
01:44:58.791,01:45:00.166,"You see this face, do you see it?"
01:45:00.250,01:45:02.958,"Man, here's 165,000 right here. Cash."
01:45:03.041,01:45:05.208,"I'm showing you because it wasn't easy, man."
01:45:05.291,01:45:07.583,"Six percent goes to Demany, I've already taken that out, all right?"
01:45:07.666,01:45:09.208,"All right, I guess that's fair."
01:45:09.291,01:45:11.500,"Let me get the fucking opal, man. Let me get the fuck up out of here."
01:45:11.583,01:45:14.250,This opal's very valuable for you.
01:45:16.625,01:45:17.833,Get the fuck out...
01:45:21.916,01:45:24.750,"-Thought you was a fan too, man. -I'm a fucking huge fan."
01:45:24.833,01:45:27.458,What'd you pay for this? Real shit. What'd you pay for this right here?
01:45:27.541,01:45:29.875,"That's not a fair question, Kevin, all right?"
01:45:29.958,01:45:32.875,We're talking months and months of fucking my time.
01:45:32.958,01:45:35.166,"I'm not gonna take the money back. I mean, I did the deal now."
01:45:35.250,01:45:39.625,"I'm just saying. Straight up, me and you, How much you pay for this?"
01:45:39.708,01:45:43.750,Fuckin'... What'd I pay? I paid a... This is...
01:45:45.916,01:45:48.208,"If I answer that question, it's very misleading."
01:45:48.291,01:45:49.125,Why?
01:45:49.916,01:45:52.583,"-I paid 100 grand, okay? -So you doubled your money?"
01:45:55.791,01:45:57.958,A million dollars is what I was supposed to get.
01:45:58.041,01:46:01.708,I get a fucking what? Made 65 Gs?
01:46:01.791,01:46:06.500,You gave some niggas from Ethiopia 100 grand for something you thought was worth a million dollars.
01:46:06.583,01:46:08.041,You don't see nothing wrong with that?
01:46:08.125,01:46:10.875,"Ethiopian miners, you know what these fucking guys make?"
01:46:10.958,01:46:14.541,100 grand's 50 lifetimes for these fucking guys.
01:46:14.625,01:46:16.583,"A million dollars is more, that's my point. Understand?"
01:46:16.666,01:46:20.958,"Well, you wanna win by one point or fucking 30 points, KG, right?"
01:46:21.041,01:46:24.250,I see you out there with the fucking stadiums all booing you.
01:46:24.333,01:46:26.958,"You're 30 up, you're still going full tilt."
01:46:27.958,01:46:30.625,Let's see what Vegas... What does Vegas got you guys at tonight?
01:46:30.708,01:46:31.750,Take a look. Let's see.
01:46:31.833,01:46:34.083,"Hold on, are you serious? You're gonna pull this up right here?"
01:46:34.166,01:46:37.875,"Look at this shit. The Sixers are supposed to win the game tonight, they think."
01:46:37.958,01:46:39.500,I don't keep track of none of that shit.
01:46:39.583,01:46:42.958,"They think on game seven, you're not gonna get fucking 18 points."
01:46:43.041,01:46:44.708,They don't think you're gonna get eight rebounds?
01:46:44.791,01:46:46.208,These guys don't know shit about ball.
01:46:46.291,01:46:47.333,What the fuck do they do?
01:46:47.416,01:46:49.375,Doesn't that make you want to fucking kill them?
01:46:49.458,01:46:52.416,"Doesn't that make you wanna say, Fuck you for doubting me?"
01:46:52.500,01:46:56.916,Doesn't that make you wanna step on fucking Elton Brand's fucking neck?
01:46:57.000,01:47:01.083,"Come on, KG, this is no different than that. This is me."
01:47:01.166,01:47:05.583,"All right? I'm not a fucking athlete, this is my fucking way, this is how I win."
01:47:06.375,01:47:12.291,"All right? All the fucking hard work I do, all the fucking ass kicking, and the dues I pay."
01:47:12.375,01:47:16.125,"You're not gonna score on the big one, on game seven?"
01:47:16.208,01:47:20.166,"Fuck these people, right? That's how you feel, I know you do."
01:47:20.250,01:47:21.416,"So, look..."
01:47:23.833,01:47:27.458,Let's fucking bet on this. Let's bet on this shit.
01:47:29.291,01:47:32.291,"I'm fucking gonna bet all this money on you tonight, KG."
01:47:33.333,01:47:36.416,"You're here to win, KG. These fuckers don't know."
01:47:36.500,01:47:39.625,"Them out fucking west, do you think they fucking know you?"
01:47:39.708,01:47:41.833,They don't know you. They don't know us.
01:47:41.916,01:47:45.208,It's about fucking winning. It's about you.
01:47:45.291,01:47:50.833,"And I saw your fucking conviction, your fucking honesty."
01:47:50.916,01:47:52.958,And your fucking magic.
01:47:55.333,01:47:59.583,"KG, do you even understand how fucking great of a game you're gonna have tonight? I know it."
01:47:59.666,01:48:02.750,"-Listen... -We're a team tonight, KG."
01:48:02.833,01:48:05.833,This is a fucking lock-in. It's a fucking feeling.
01:48:05.916,01:48:09.833,"We both have it. They don't know. You and I know, all right?"
01:48:19.041,01:48:20.083,What the fuck are...
01:48:20.166,01:48:23.333,"Hey, do you mind watching the space while I run to the bathroom?"
01:48:23.416,01:48:25.166,-Sure. -Thank you.
01:48:25.791,01:48:27.166,I can leave you guys alone in here?
01:48:27.250,01:48:28.833,"Go handle your business, sweetheart."
01:48:28.916,01:48:29.916,Do you want company?
01:48:30.000,01:48:32.125,"I don't think so, but next time maybe."
01:48:36.208,01:48:38.083,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm looking for Howard."
01:48:38.666,01:48:41.000,"-I'm sorry, we're closed. -He gave me a fucking fake Rolex."
01:48:41.083,01:48:43.000,"I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that, sir."
01:48:43.083,01:48:44.833,Please calm down. I don't know anything about that.
01:48:44.916,01:48:46.666,Let me talk to you about this. You gotta help me.
01:48:46.750,01:48:47.708,"I'm sorry, I'm busy."
01:48:47.791,01:48:51.208,This is gonna be one of the best nights of our fucking life.
01:48:51.291,01:48:52.625,Howard. Howard.
01:48:59.625,01:49:01.208,Come on. Come on.
01:49:01.291,01:49:03.958,"Come on, come on. Where are you? Hey."
01:49:04.041,01:49:05.208,"Howard, what the fuck is going on?"
01:49:05.291,01:49:06.166,-Take this. -What is this?
01:49:06.250,01:49:07.375,I need you to listen to me carefully.
01:49:07.458,01:49:11.125,"I booked you on a blade, okay? You're gonna land on top of the Mohegan Sun."
01:49:11.208,01:49:12.250,Okay.
01:49:12.333,01:49:14.041,There's a bet in that bag.
01:49:14.125,01:49:18.208,"I want you to take all of it, all of it inside the bag and place it on that bet."
01:49:18.291,01:49:20.083,-How much is in the bag? -There's a lot.
01:49:20.166,01:49:22.000,I don't want you to think about that. All right?
01:49:22.083,01:49:26.041,"I don't even look at it until you get there, and you take it out, and give it to the teller."
01:49:26.125,01:49:27.333,-Understand? -I got it.
01:49:27.416,01:49:29.458,I'm gonna fuck the living shit out of you tonight.
01:49:29.541,01:49:30.958,-You know that? -I wish I could kiss you.
01:49:32.666,01:49:35.458,"-Get going. Get going. -All right, love you. Bye."
01:49:39.750,01:49:41.041,"See you, guys."
01:49:45.583,01:49:46.833,Let's get this over with.
01:49:46.916,01:49:49.541,Arno. You're never gonna believe this shit.
01:49:49.625,01:49:51.041,Believe what?
01:49:51.125,01:49:53.458,We're about to hit so goddamn big.
01:49:53.541,01:49:55.875,"KG was just here. You saw him, right?"
01:49:55.958,01:49:59.916,I gave him the gem. He's gonna fuck up the money line so bad tonight.
01:50:00.000,01:50:01.833,"Howard, where's the money right now?"
01:50:01.916,01:50:04.791,It's on the way right now. It's on the way to the casino.
01:50:09.166,01:50:11.125,-Girl that went to the bathroom? -I ain't seen her.
01:50:11.208,01:50:12.833,-She didn't get back here? -No.
01:50:15.375,01:50:18.166,Go get her now. Bring her back.
01:50:18.250,01:50:19.833,-Hey. Hit the buzzer. -Open the fucking door!
01:50:19.916,01:50:22.458,For what? What am I opening the door for?
01:50:28.250,01:50:30.458,Get your hands off me. What the fuck are we doing?
01:50:30.541,01:50:36.791,It's gonna make sense to you in about two fucking minutes. Listen to what-- -I'm listening. -You're gonna do what I tell you.
01:50:36.875,01:50:56.666,"Listen, you fucking goon, I'm telling you something good-- Hey, come on, come on."
01:51:00.625,01:51:02.708,I'll drop you on your fucking head! You hear me?
01:51:02.791,01:51:03.916,Gimme the word. I let him go.
01:51:04.000,01:51:06.833,"-I got kids, help me up. -You gonna call him?"
01:51:06.916,01:51:09.375,-I'll call! Please. -Get that bitch down here now!
01:51:13.125,01:51:14.791,There you go.
01:51:14.875,01:51:19.125,Listen to me. Get yourself together. All right?
01:51:19.208,01:51:22.083,"Yeah, I want you to make that call. You hear me?"
01:51:22.791,01:51:24.666,"Give me a fucking second, please."
01:51:25.250,01:51:27.125,You have plenty of time. After you make the call.
01:51:27.208,01:51:28.041,My heart.
01:51:34.916,01:51:36.541,She's in Mohegan Sun.
01:51:50.041,01:51:51.125,This motherfucker...
01:51:54.041,01:51:55.291,"Come on, come on."
01:52:04.958,01:52:07.708,I'm sorry. I really am. I am sorry.
01:52:12.375,01:52:14.041,"I mean, fuck this!"
01:52:15.125,01:52:16.208,You're a moron.
01:52:22.125,01:52:24.666,What are you doing? Why am I buzzing? Why are you going?
01:52:24.750,01:52:25.791,Just buzz me the fuck out.
01:52:25.875,01:52:28.041,-Watch the fucking game. -Buzz me the fuck out.
01:52:28.125,01:52:29.958,-You'll be happy with the results. -Buzz me out.
01:52:30.041,01:52:32.916,"I'm telling you now, before I put your head through the fucking glass."
01:52:33.000,01:52:35.458,"All right, I'll buzz you out. I'll buzz you out. All right?"
01:52:38.916,01:52:41.416,Now close that door. Close it.
01:52:42.208,01:52:43.708,"Come on, buzz me out."
01:52:45.666,01:52:46.750,What are you doing?
01:52:55.708,01:52:58.416,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not buzzing you out.
01:52:59.000,01:53:00.375,"Arno, Arno."
01:53:02.708,01:53:03.625,You understand?
01:53:10.166,01:53:11.958,"You know what she looks like, find her."
01:53:12.041,01:53:13.875,They're gonna get to the guard and fold...
01:53:13.958,01:53:15.083,Howard. Open the door!
01:53:15.166,01:53:17.083,"-I know you're upset, Arno. -Of course I am."
01:53:17.166,01:53:19.583,I'm trying to fucking make this all work for you.
01:53:22.291,01:53:25.333,"they got fucking-- There's no money in that, you understand?"
01:53:25.416,01:53:27.458,The refs know that. They want stars.
01:53:27.541,01:53:29.833,"-Buzz us the fuck out, Howard. -Stars get 'em fucking ratings."
01:53:31.583,01:53:34.166,"-Hey, this is fucking bulletproof. -Open it now!"
01:53:36.208,01:53:37.625,-Phil. Phil. -I'm telling you to open it.
01:53:37.708,01:53:39.708,"Arno, I'd duck, you're gonna get killed."
01:53:41.666,01:53:42.500,Thank you.
01:53:42.583,01:53:45.166,I'm talking to Arno. Enough of you.
01:53:47.291,01:53:48.333,I got something for you.
01:53:48.416,01:53:58.500,"You realize all he's gotta do is get the opening tip, You know? Who is that? Who are you talking to?"
01:53:58.583,01:54:00.541,Who did you call? Who did you call?
01:54:17.541,01:54:18.541,Make it quick...
01:54:18.625,01:54:20.250,ConEd called the office.
01:54:20.333,01:54:23.125,There is a fucking leak. There's a gas leak on Pinoak.
01:54:23.208,01:54:24.291,"For crying out loud, Howard."
01:54:24.375,01:54:25.833,So they're evacuating the whole block.
01:54:25.916,01:54:27.416,Just slow down? You're not making sense.
01:54:30.208,01:54:31.750,-Why'd they call the office... -Stay at Amy's.
01:54:31.833,01:54:33.791,I don't know why they called me.
01:54:33.875,01:54:36.250,-It's not making any sense. -I'm not here to argue with you.
01:54:36.333,01:54:39.416,"-I'm looking out the window right now. -Dinah, get the kids outta the house."
01:54:39.500,01:54:40.458,"I'm frightened, okay?"
01:54:42.458,01:54:44.791,"-and do not leave there till I get home. -Oh, my God."
01:54:44.875,01:54:47.375,You promise me? Stay in the house. Okay?
01:54:47.458,01:54:48.791,-Okay. You'll meet us there? -Yes.
01:54:50.875,01:54:52.833,Open the fucking door!
01:54:55.458,01:54:57.208,I don't even know what to do with my money anymore.
01:54:57.291,01:55:00.291,"I have nobody to spend it with, nobody to enjoy my life with anymore."
01:55:00.375,01:55:01.208,It's horrible.
01:55:01.291,01:55:04.208,"Today is a big day for me. I met you, you're hot."
01:55:04.291,01:55:05.958,You wanna have a drink when we get there?
01:55:37.708,01:55:38.958,-Hey. -Hey.
01:55:39.041,01:55:45.958,"Okay, so I'm betting on the Celtics, parlay three way, money, I don't know, plus tip. Here, you just have to..."
01:55:46.041,01:55:47.708,"So, you wanna parlay three ways."
01:55:47.791,01:55:49.875,"Make sure when you put it in, it's exactly that."
01:55:49.958,01:55:52.125,I will. How much you want on it?
01:55:52.208,01:55:55.666,"-I'm not sure. You're gonna have to... -Oh, okay."
01:55:57.416,01:55:58.291,Give me a minute?
01:55:58.375,01:56:00.916,"I just have to have my supervisor count this, okay?"
01:56:04.166,01:56:06.000,-We're almost there. -One second.
01:56:24.041,01:56:25.666,Come on. Let's go.
01:56:26.750,01:56:29.750,I'm feeling this. Feeling this.
01:56:30.833,01:56:32.250,Beautiful.
01:56:47.958,01:56:50.125,I want you to say it really loud. Give me a second.
01:56:50.208,01:56:52.583,I want some people to hear it. Hang on.
01:56:52.666,01:56:55.125,Hang on. Say the whole ticket. Go ahead.
01:56:58.291,01:57:04.125,Garnett's points plus his rebounds with the Celtics money line with the Celtics to win the opening tip.
01:57:07.583,01:57:11.208,"-Okay. So, it says here to win... -You having a good time?"
01:57:11.291,01:57:15.041,"-Yes. -...$1,229,000."
01:57:15.125,01:57:17.500,Did you fucking hear that number? That's enough.
01:57:17.583,01:57:20.791,"You don't have to say any more. The bet's in. The bet's in, okay?"
01:57:21.791,01:57:23.166,I'm taking you to the fucking...
01:57:23.250,01:57:25.541,"The Ritz Carlton, the Grand Cayman, all right?"
01:57:25.625,01:57:26.958,"-With a fucking jacuzzi. -Okay, sure."
01:57:27.041,01:57:30.000,"-All right, rub that tattoo for me. -Okay, okay, I love you."
01:57:30.708,01:57:32.083,"Okay, here we go."
01:57:32.166,01:57:35.166,"We grab this tip and we're in business, boys, all right?"
01:57:36.458,01:57:39.625,"Pound that chest, baby. This is it. We gotta get this."
01:57:39.708,01:57:42.041,This is right out the gate. Right out the gate.
01:57:46.750,01:57:49.541,Get that tip. Let's go get that fucking tip.
01:57:51.125,01:57:55.666,"but maybe for this big-3 hour of Garnett, Pierce and Allen."
01:57:55.750,01:57:57.250,And that's a long way off...
01:58:00.666,01:58:03.375,"Fuck, we would have been fucked if we didn't get that."
01:58:03.458,01:58:07.125,That was the fucking biggest part of the whole goddamn parlay right there.
01:58:07.208,01:58:11.166,That was huge. I knew he was gonna win that. I knew he was gonna win that.
01:58:11.250,01:58:13.458,All right. Get set...
01:58:13.541,01:58:16.250,It's been a defensive battle almost every game. Blocked by Pierce.
01:58:16.333,01:58:19.125,One! One rebound! Boom! That's one. That's fucking one.
01:58:19.208,01:58:20.625,Look at that. Look at that.
01:58:20.708,01:58:24.833,Right out the fucking gate. The man... The man's feeling the gem!
01:58:25.333,01:58:26.791,"Go, get it, get it."
01:58:26.875,01:58:30.000,"-Garnett down low against... -Go, go finish, finish it."
01:58:30.083,01:58:33.166,"Hey. Yes! All right, that's fucking it."
01:58:33.250,01:58:36.041,"That's the first shot of the game, he fucking hit it. That's three now."
01:58:36.125,01:58:39.333,Two plus that fucking rebound. That's three out of the 26.
01:58:39.416,01:58:44.250,"Okay, I bet on, um, the Celtics. Specifically Kevin Garnett."
01:58:44.333,01:58:45.416,Okay. Two good bets.
01:58:45.500,01:58:52.458,"Celtics are winning and Garnett's got nine and seven, so that's 16 right now on your way to 26, you said, right?"
01:58:57.333,01:58:58.833,How are you from the helicopter to here?
01:58:58.916,01:59:01.208,"How you doing, baby? I can't get you out of my mind."
01:59:02.833,01:59:04.208,"-You're funny. -Oh, you're hot, baby."
01:59:04.291,01:59:05.625,-You're definitely hot. -Yeah.
01:59:13.708,01:59:16.166,"-He should have gotten that one. -He missed a shot, who cares?"
01:59:16.250,01:59:19.625,"-I have a great idea for halftime, okay? -What's that?"
01:59:21.708,01:59:24.875,"I hired a chef, I'm in penthouse A, and I got you, it's gorgeous."
01:59:24.958,01:59:27.166,Best views. Who could ask for more than that?
01:59:27.250,01:59:28.083,Thank you.
01:59:40.333,01:59:41.166,Are you okay?
01:59:43.833,01:59:45.750,-Oh... -What happened?
02:00:13.125,02:00:17.291,"This is the beauty of betting. This is the beauty of betting, you know?"
02:00:17.375,02:00:20.541,"I'm fucking pulling for the Celtics, a Knicks fan..."
02:00:20.625,02:00:25.208,"If the fucking 12-year-old version of me saw me right now, he'd be like, What the fuck?"
02:00:27.666,02:00:28.791,Tell them to come over here.
02:00:32.250,02:00:34.166,We're gonna fucking snatch her and bring her back.
02:00:34.250,02:00:37.500,"Boss, boss. Absolutely."
02:00:40.000,02:00:42.333,KG. Look at KG.
02:00:42.916,02:00:46.666,"Remember this. If you wanna go quickly, do it alone."
02:00:47.250,02:00:51.000,"But if you wanna go far, you do it together."
02:00:51.083,02:00:53.750,We're like roaches. And you can't kill us.
02:00:53.833,02:00:56.000,Quit fucking passing. Get it to him.
02:00:56.083,02:00:57.291,And another and another.
02:00:57.375,02:00:59.958,And shoot. Shoot! Shoot!
02:01:00.041,02:01:02.958,"Fuck, that shit, fucking Doc."
02:01:03.041,02:01:05.958,Fucking threw his rhythm off. He took him out of the game.
02:01:06.625,02:01:09.333,"Fuck, man. That's your fault."
02:01:09.833,02:01:13.625,"You see that other guy though, Phil? One of your boys from Boston."
02:01:13.708,02:01:17.000,You got some boys in Boston? You'll see who I'm talking-- Hang on.
02:01:17.666,02:01:20.416,"This fucker, is that one of your boys, that fat fuck?"
02:01:20.500,02:01:23.083,Looks like you. Looks like one of your boys.
02:01:25.250,02:01:27.750,That's a fucking rebound. That's it.
02:01:27.833,02:01:30.291,"Three more, three more. Way to go."
02:01:30.375,02:01:33.625,What does that say up there? What is the score? Are they winning?
02:01:36.333,02:01:39.041,Fuck that shit. He fucking fouled him.
02:01:39.125,02:01:41.208,"Doesn't matter, he grabbed it, he had it."
02:01:41.291,02:01:43.416,That counts as one. Now what are we at? 23?
02:01:46.291,02:01:48.666,"All right, last possession. Let's go. Get it."
02:01:48.750,02:01:50.958,"Pick it up. All right, that's it. That's it!"
02:01:51.041,02:01:54.916,"Shoot that shit. Come on, K. Shoot it. Shoot it."
02:01:56.791,02:01:58.416,Oh!
02:01:58.500,02:02:01.791,"Holy, fuck, yeah! They fuckin' got it."
02:02:02.875,02:02:06.416,"Just, fucking, that's all the gem. It's all the gem."
02:02:08.000,02:02:10.125,We're at 25 now! One more.
02:02:10.916,02:02:12.291,One more fucking point.
02:02:12.375,02:02:14.916,Either a rebound or a fucking basket.
02:02:15.000,02:02:18.208,"Anything. Either one, we fucking got this."
02:02:19.208,02:02:21.208,"All right, one more. Just need one more."
02:02:23.416,02:02:26.291,Come on in. Three times in one day.
02:02:26.375,02:02:27.875,"-I know, I know. -Unbelievable."
02:02:27.958,02:02:30.583,I believe it's you. Where's your boyfriend?
02:02:30.666,02:02:32.208,-Why don't we watch the game? -Without a doubt.
02:02:32.291,02:02:34.291,"Go ahead, honey. Sit down, make yourself comfortable."
02:02:36.791,02:02:39.291,"The iPad's over there, do what you gotta do with the iPad."
02:02:39.375,02:02:41.125,"Look, I gotta take a shower, okay?"
02:02:41.208,02:02:44.333,I really gotta take a shower. I gotta clean up. Gotta get myself washed.
02:02:44.416,02:02:47.125,"That plane ride, got me all messed up and everything else."
02:02:47.208,02:02:50.666,"So what I want you to do. If that doorbell rings, okay?"
02:02:50.750,02:02:54.458,"I got my friends, okay, coming in, or I got the food coming, okay?"
02:02:54.541,02:02:56.125,"You just answer it and let 'em in, okay, baby?"
02:03:08.250,02:03:13.125,"That's it. Okay, that's two that's done. We got that. Two."
02:03:13.208,02:03:16.166,Just gotta win now. Celt's gotta win and we're fucking done.
02:03:16.250,02:03:17.541,"We're done, Arno."
02:03:22.333,02:03:23.958,68-73 Boston.
02:03:26.583,02:03:29.083,"You wanna call down, just cancel the fucking food?"
02:03:29.166,02:03:31.583,"I wanna go out. Baby, I love that you're into this game."
02:03:38.000,02:03:40.375,"trying to get rid of Brandon Bass, tries it again."
02:03:40.458,02:03:42.958,"Up and under, shot misses. Allen on the rebound."
02:03:43.041,02:03:45.500,Push it. Push... Push it.
02:03:45.583,02:03:47.666,"Push it, go, to the fucking hole."
02:03:47.750,02:03:49.166,"Get it, KG, get it!"
02:03:49.250,02:03:52.250,"Ah, don't fucking miss that. Don't miss that. It's all right."
02:03:52.333,02:03:54.291,-...with 57 seconds remaining... -It's all right.
02:03:54.375,02:03:58.500,KG's gonna hit this fucking shot. Let's ice this shit.
02:03:59.458,02:04:02.208,"Sink this shot. Sink it, sink it. Come on."
02:04:02.291,02:04:03.791,Feel it. Feel it...
02:04:03.875,02:04:05.166,"Feel it, come on."
02:04:05.250,02:04:08.708,"He's got the gem. He's got the gem, feel that fucking gem."
02:04:09.500,02:04:14.125,"With 15 of 16 from the line, again, only taken four here in the second half."
02:04:16.291,02:04:19.416,"Oh, fucking cock. It's all right, it's all right."
02:04:19.500,02:04:23.416,"All right, we're up and up. We're up and up. This is not that big of a deal."
02:04:24.041,02:04:26.333,This'll just fucking help seal it. But we're good.
02:04:26.416,02:04:29.250,"No talk. Just fucking do your shit, man."
02:04:29.333,02:04:31.125,Do your shit. Do your shit.
02:04:31.208,02:04:34.458,"When Pierce fouled out, there was a little over -four minutes remaining. -You got this shit."
02:04:34.541,02:04:36.375,Celtics led by three.
02:04:37.500,02:04:41.458,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right, the truth fucking feels it."
02:04:41.541,02:04:44.916,I feel it. I'm confident now. I'm confident.
02:04:45.666,02:04:48.250,"Don't let 'em shoot that, don't let 'em shoot that."
02:04:48.333,02:04:52.833,"Get that, grab that shit. Yes! Oh! Oh, my God."
02:04:58.416,02:04:59.583,Holy shit.

02:05:05.458,02:05:06.750,"Oh, my God."
02:05:09.458,02:05:11.708,Howard? Did we just win?
02:05:11.791,02:05:14.833,"Oh, my fucking God! Are you kidding me?"
02:05:14.916,02:05:17.083,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
02:05:17.166,02:05:20.333,"Oh, shit. Oh, my God, baby. I love you."

02:05:45.250,02:05:48.708,"I'm so happy, I fucking... It's going down. It's going down."
02:05:52.666,02:05:53.958,You've made your mark.
02:05:58.041,02:06:00.791,And make sure they fucking walk you to the car.
02:06:00.875,02:06:02.833,All right? I'm gonna book you a plane.
02:06:19.791,02:06:22.083,"Hey, get off me. Shut the fuck up."
02:06:22.166,02:06:25.583,"Or you'll wind up next to him, you hear me? Don't fucking confuse me."
02:06:33.833,02:06:37.208,What do you wanna say? Do it. Do it!
02:06:37.291,02:06:40.958,I want outta here. Let me outta here. Let me out!
02:06:47.708,02:06:51.041,Get over here. Stay right there. Stay right fucking there.

02:06:59.875,02:07:00.958,Get over here.
02:07:13.875,02:07:15.833,"When you win, it's all that matters."
02:07:15.916,02:07:18.583,"You know? The big be quiet, the big shut up, you know?"
02:07:19.458,02:07:21.000,"Killin' doubters, killin' haters."
02:07:21.083,02:07:22.541,"Bring it in, bring it in..."
02:07:22.625,02:07:24.291,"That's a lot of fucking money, right?"
02:07:24.375,02:07:25.958,"And a personal one to you, bruh."
02:07:30.000,02:07:33.458,"That's some strong shit. Oh. That's my nigga right there, boy."
02:07:33.541,02:07:35.416,"Look at that motherfucker, man."
02:07:35.500,02:07:39.375,"I know that guy, I know that guy. My dad sold a ring to him."
02:07:40.083,02:07:41.541,"Eddie, I can't think."
02:07:41.625,02:07:45.625,"Amy, he was naked in the trunk, okay? I'm calling the police."
02:07:45.708,02:07:50.625,"All the dues and everything that I put into this, you wouldn't think that I would show up to game sevens?"
02:07:50.708,02:07:51.750,"Yeah, that's a joke."
02:07:53.791,02:07:57.125,"He goes to the bench, did you feel that you needed to shoulder his load for..."
02:07:57.208,02:07:58.541,Well done. Congratulations.
02:08:08.083,02:08:12.250,so I know we all share that responsibility and we did a good job. You know?
02:08:12.333,02:08:16.916,"In the end, I felt like it was just me and the rock, um, nothing else."
02:08:27.041,02:08:28.291,"Oh, my God, Wayne."
02:08:28.375,02:08:29.958,"-Thank you so much. -All right, baby."
02:08:30.041,02:08:32.000,My pleasure. A lot of money.
02:08:32.083,02:08:33.958,"I want you to come to the Avalon, have one drink."
02:08:34.041,02:08:35.833,"No, I can't. I gotta go, bye, baby."
02:08:35.916,02:08:38.083,"-No, I gotta go. -Let's have one drink."
02:08:38.166,02:08:39.458,We can go now.
02:08:45.291,02:08:47.916,"Go, go! Find their fucking cameras?"
02:08:48.000,02:08:49.750,"All right, go, go, come on."
