00:01:13.991,00:01:17.369,Happy birthday to you!
00:01:19.747,00:01:22.666,WESLEY: It's my anorexic boss' birthday.
00:01:24.459,00:01:31.759,This means there's a certain amount of inter-office pressure to stand around the conference table eating crappy food and pretending to worship her.
00:01:33.802,00:01:35.804,That's so good.
00:01:35.846,00:01:42.185,Acting for five minutes like Janice doesn't make all our lives miserable is the hardest work I'll do all day.
00:01:48.692,00:01:52.071,My job title is account manager.
00:01:52.112,00:02:00.412,"I used to be called an account service representative, but a consultant told us we needed to manage our clients and not service them."
00:02:06.627,00:02:10.047,I have a girlfriend whom I neither manage nor service.
00:02:10.089,00:02:15.761,"That's my best friend, Barry, fucking her on an IKEA kitchen table I picked up for a really good price."
00:02:18.263,00:02:22.225,I'm finding it hard to care about anything these days.
00:02:22.267,00:02:27.022,"In fact, the only thing I do care about is the fact that I can't care about anything."
00:02:27.064,00:02:28.440,Seriously. It worries me.
00:02:30.400,00:02:32.193,My name is Wesley Gibson.
00:02:37.198,00:02:40.869,My dad walked out on my mom when I was seven days old.
00:02:40.911,00:02:50.754,"Sometimes I wonder if he ever looked into my baby blues eyes and asked himself, Did I just father the most insignificant asshole of the 21st century?"
00:03:07.021,00:03:11.733,"Well, if you could get me the consignment to me by the 28th... Yeah."
00:03:11.775,00:03:14.277,Do you have the numbers in front of you?
00:03:25.288,00:03:26.915,Relax.
00:03:26.957,00:03:29.626,"If your name had come up, you'd be dead already."
00:03:32.629,00:03:35.382,We've had some unexpected losses recently.
00:03:37.134,00:03:41.805,We'd like to know where our competitor is getting his munition.
00:03:51.982,00:03:53.358,It's clean.
00:03:53.859,00:03:54.943,Meaning?
00:03:55.819,00:03:57.571,Meaning it's untraceable.
00:03:58.488,00:04:00.074,Your competitor's very smart.
00:04:00.115,00:04:01.324,Get down!
00:04:19.634,00:04:20.719,Fuck it.
00:05:47.681,00:05:50.767,"No one leaves the Fraternity, Cross."
00:05:50.809,00:05:53.520,CROSS ON PHONE: I have a new perspective on the Fraternity.
00:05:53.561,00:05:55.522,Careful.
00:05:55.563,00:05:59.400,You don't destroy something that's been around for a thousand years.
00:05:59.442,00:06:02.403,It's already destroyed.
00:06:02.445,00:06:04.447,I have to stop this.
00:06:04.489,00:06:06.407,Really?
00:06:07.659,00:06:09.911,So why don't you face me yourself?
00:06:13.123,00:06:15.083,Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
00:06:17.127,00:06:18.837,They were just the decoys.
00:06:19.629,00:06:21.048,"Goodbye, Mr. X."
00:06:55.207,00:06:57.542,MR. X: Never send sheep to kill a wolf.
00:06:57.584,00:06:59.544,They were just the decoys.
00:07:01.088,00:07:02.089,CATHY: Wesley!
00:07:03.422,00:07:04.799,What is it?
00:07:04.841,00:07:07.594,"What do you mean, What is it? Listen."
00:07:09.596,00:07:13.975,"Well, how am I suppose to sleep with all that fucking racket?"
00:07:14.017,00:07:17.437,When are we gonna move so we don't have to wake up to that shit?
00:07:17.478,00:07:20.607,I kind of like it.
00:07:20.648,00:07:24.361,"WESLEY: It helps to drown out the sound of your annoying, fucking voice."
00:07:24.403,00:07:26.654,"Now, please, let me sleep."
00:07:26.696,00:07:28.865,Have you even thought about our talk?
00:07:28.907,00:07:29.908,Yes.
00:07:31.201,00:07:32.702,Which one?
00:07:34.454,00:07:36.123,Perfect. That's perfect.
00:07:37.207,00:07:38.666,Feed Annabelle.
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.088,Sorry.
00:08:28.633,00:08:31.552,"Oh, my fucking God."
00:08:31.594,00:08:34.639,I hope that's not my billing report sitting on your desk.
00:08:34.681,00:08:36.891,"Holy shit on an altar, it is."
00:08:37.976,00:08:41.396,I want that report on my desk in one hour.
00:08:41.438,00:08:44.774,"Okay, everybody, we're all gonna stay an extra hour..."
00:08:44.816,00:08:47.068,WESLEY: Want to hear something sad?
00:08:47.110,00:08:51.739,I need an ergonomic keyboard to keep my repetitive stress injury in check.
00:08:51.781,00:08:56.036,Just the fact that I repeat something enough that it causes me stress is fucking sad.
00:08:56.077,00:08:58.121,"Nice job, dude."
00:09:00.081,00:09:02.000,He had to go to the dentist.
00:09:04.127,00:09:05.212,Yes!
00:09:06.463,00:09:07.588,Barry!
00:09:12.052,00:09:14.554,You think they have that morning-after pill here?
00:09:14.595,00:09:16.223,That thing works.
00:09:14.595,00:09:19.726,"Crush it up, put it in her omelet, Hey, baby, breakfast in bed. You can never be too safe."
00:09:19.767,00:09:21.144,"Oh, God."
00:09:22.479,00:09:24.605,I lost my wallet somewhere.
00:09:26.649,00:09:28.235,All this together?
00:09:29.528,00:09:31.029,"No, no."
00:09:33.323,00:09:34.949,He is the man.
00:09:34.991,00:09:36.951,How much is it?
00:09:38.328,00:09:39.538,PHARMACIST: $20.42.
00:09:43.458,00:09:44.918,Chicks dig it.
00:09:48.171,00:09:49.589,Thanks.
00:09:49.630,00:09:50.715,See you next time.
00:09:50.757,00:09:51.966,PHARMACIST: Have a good night.
00:09:52.008,00:09:53.801,"I love these energy drinks, man."
00:09:53.843,00:09:59.766,"I'm almost, like, kind of on an energy drink cleanse, where I do one for breakfast and then, like, two or three for lunch."
00:09:59.807,00:10:01.268,WESLEY: I'm the man?
00:10:01.309,00:10:03.603,"Barry, I'm the man."
00:10:03.644,00:10:10.527,"In fact, I'm so much the man, I have a standing prescription for medication to control my anxiety attacks."
00:10:10.569,00:10:12.987,"God, I wish I had something else to relieve my stress."
00:10:13.029,00:10:14.281,"Hello, Wesley."
00:10:17.784,00:10:26.793,"WESLEY: You know, there are people, beautiful people, you just wish they could see you in a different setting, a different place, instead of where you are, what you've become."
00:10:30.046,00:10:31.089,What?
00:10:32.257,00:10:34.509,Boom goes the dynamite.
00:10:34.551,00:10:40.223,"WESLEY: But most of all, you wish you weren't such a pussy for wishing for things that will never change."
00:10:43.560,00:10:48.856,"JANICE: Good God A'mighty, you're over here like it's spring fucking break, and I still don't have that billing report."
00:10:48.898,00:10:51.025,"Why do I even keep you around, Wesley?"
00:10:52.319,00:10:54.195,"I'll get it done, Janice."
00:10:54.237,00:10:57.698,heard that before.
00:10:57.740,00:11:00.535,I'll get it done.
00:11:00.577,00:11:02.662,I'll get it done.
00:11:14.048,00:11:16.801,Why don't you have anything to say for yourself?
00:11:20.679,00:11:22.265,"Well, you're worthless."
00:11:22.307,00:11:25.059,I'm the one who's sorry I hired your ass.
00:11:51.169,00:11:54.422,WESLEY: You know what the best thing is about the end of the day?
00:11:54.464,00:11:57.050,Tomorrow it starts all over again.
00:13:09.205,00:13:10.915,Hi. How you doing?
00:13:24.220,00:13:26.431,I'm sorry?
00:13:30.602,00:13:32.228,Sorry about that.
00:13:40.737,00:13:42.405,I knew your father.
00:13:46.618,00:13:50.538,"My father left the week I was born, so..."
00:13:50.580,00:13:54.292,Your father died yesterday on the rooftop of the Metropolitan Building.
00:13:54.334,00:13:55.502,Sorry.
00:14:02.342,00:14:04.302,"Look, the liquor rounds are just over there, so..."
00:14:04.344,00:14:06.805,Your father was one of the greatest assassins who ever lived.
00:14:06.845,00:14:09.098,The man who killed him is behind you.
00:15:27.385,00:15:29.220,This guy's just shooting up...
00:15:37.186,00:15:38.563,Sorry. Sorry.
00:16:05.005,00:16:07.383,"What... Oh, my God!"
00:16:12.472,00:16:14.849,Please! Please!
00:16:14.891,00:16:16.851,Please be quiet.
00:16:16.893,00:16:20.020,Please... Please understand that I care about my life!
00:16:25.610,00:16:29.363,"I don't know what the fuck you did to piss this guy off, but you're gonna have to let me out and call the cops!"
00:16:32.575,00:16:33.868,Hey! Hey!
00:16:37.747,00:16:41.208,What are you doing?
00:16:45.254,00:16:46.422,"Oh, shit!"
00:16:52.178,00:16:54.388,I think we lost him.
00:16:54.430,00:16:57.141,"Could you let me out at the next corner, please?"
00:16:58.601,00:16:59.686,Shit!
00:17:02.856,00:17:03.690,Fuck!
00:17:06.526,00:17:08.027,"Oh, shit!"
00:17:10.446,00:17:11.990,He's right there!
00:17:23.626,00:17:26.379,"Look, I'm an accountant."
00:17:27.797,00:17:29.465,"Oh, fuck!"
00:17:32.468,00:17:34.595,"He's fucking persistent, you know."
00:17:36.138,00:17:37.306,Fuck!
00:17:44.856,00:17:46.524,You kick his ass!
00:17:51.529,00:17:52.697,Shoot him!
00:17:54.574,00:17:57.785,What are you doing?
00:17:59.954,00:18:02.373,Are you crazy?
00:18:03.165,00:18:05.043,Where are you going?
00:18:06.711,00:18:08.295,Get back in here!
00:18:09.797,00:18:12.383,"Oh, my God!"
00:18:28.190,00:18:30.150,"Oh, damn! I'm sorry."
00:18:39.953,00:18:41.245,Gun!
00:18:43.998,00:18:45.625,Under the seat!
00:18:45.666,00:18:46.667,Here.
00:19:13.527,00:19:14.612,"Oh, shit!"
00:19:17.448,00:19:19.199,Shit!
00:19:25.539,00:19:26.499,Look out!
00:19:26.540,00:19:28.751,"Look out! Oh, my God!"
00:19:28.793,00:19:30.128,Shit!
00:19:38.094,00:19:42.807,WESLEY: I'm sorry!
00:20:01.784,00:20:03.161,OFFICER: Behind you!
00:21:30.998,00:21:32.291,Fuck.
00:21:35.962,00:21:37.255,Shit. Shit.
00:21:39.215,00:21:40.507,Hello.
00:21:41.550,00:21:43.719,I don't have any money or...
00:21:45.263,00:21:48.557,SLOAN: I thought he'd be taller.
00:21:49.809,00:21:50.893,Taller?
00:21:52.352,00:21:55.022,Sir...
00:21:55.064,00:21:59.485,"Sir, I've been trying to explain to the lady here that I'm an accountant."
00:21:59.526,00:22:03.363,I'm an account service representative... I'm an account manager.
00:22:03.405,00:22:09.453,"And I'm sure that if you call my boss, Janice, she'd fill you in on whatever has gone wrong."
00:22:09.495,00:22:12.414,You can contact her by email or...
00:22:12.456,00:22:14.458,Shoot the wings off the flies.
00:22:15.793,00:22:17.670,I don't know what that means.
00:22:18.629,00:22:21.632,Shoot the wings off the flies.
00:22:27.096,00:22:30.057,I really think you have me mixed up with somebody else.
00:22:31.433,00:22:33.560,On three.
00:22:33.602,00:22:35.646,"Either you shoot, or I do."
00:22:47.033,00:22:48.034,One.
00:22:51.329,00:22:52.997,Okay.
00:22:59.045,00:23:00.296,Two.
00:23:00.338,00:23:02.422,I can't even see them!
00:23:07.928,00:23:08.971,Three.
00:23:26.530,00:23:28.032,Okay. Okay.
00:23:49.345,00:23:51.055,That's impossible.
00:23:51.097,00:23:54.975,SLOAN: A lot of things for you weren't possible before today.
00:23:55.017,00:23:58.979,"What you experienced, Wesley, was not a panic attack."
00:23:59.021,00:24:05.485,"Your heart was beating in excess of 400 beats per minute, sending abundant amounts of adrenaline into your bloodstream."
00:24:05.527,00:24:08.822,This allows you to see and react faster than normal.
00:24:08.864,00:24:11.909,Only a few people in the world can do that.
00:24:11.951,00:24:16.330,Your father could do it and you can do it.
00:24:16.372,00:24:19.375,"With a little work, you can learn to control these attacks."
00:24:19.417,00:24:21.043,Stay away from me.
00:24:22.169,00:24:23.629,Just stay back from me.
00:24:23.670,00:24:25.714,"I have a gun, sir."
00:24:27.716,00:24:29.176,My name is Sloan.
00:24:30.303,00:24:32.512,This is Fox.
00:24:32.554,00:24:35.891,And the others you see around you are all very good at killing.
00:24:35.933,00:24:38.269,"So, if I were you, I'd keep the gun pointed at me."
00:24:38.311,00:24:40.104,You don't wanna point it at any of them.
00:24:40.146,00:24:41.730,That's better.
00:24:41.772,00:24:43.523,You're insane.
00:24:43.565,00:24:48.028,Insanity is wasting your life as a nothing when you have the blood of a killer flowing in your veins.
00:24:48.070,00:24:57.997,"Insanity is being shit on, beat down, coasting through life in a miserable existence when you have a caged lion locked inside and a key to release it."
00:24:59.623,00:25:03.627,This gun you're holding is an Imanishi 17.
00:25:05.338,00:25:08.257,He could conduct a symphony orchestra with it.
00:25:08.299,00:25:12.261,And you're going to use it to kill the man who shot him down in cold blood.
00:25:12.303,00:25:15.597,I can't...
00:25:18.434,00:25:20.894,Your father was one of us.
00:25:20.936,00:25:24.231,A fraternity of assassins.
00:25:26.317,00:25:29.236,We've transferred all of his assets over to you.
00:25:29.278,00:25:32.239,"And let me assure you, they are substantial."
00:25:34.992,00:25:39.663,It is your long-awaited destiny to join us.
00:25:52.218,00:25:54.220,Back off. Back off.
00:25:56.472,00:25:59.099,You don't know anything about me.
00:25:59.141,00:26:01.810,Stay away from me.
00:26:01.852,00:26:04.313,You stay away from me?
00:26:04.355,00:26:07.191,"You stay away from me, please?"
00:26:39.348,00:26:44.978,"WESLEY: You know when you have a dream and you're half awake, but it's still in the fringe of your brain?"
00:26:45.020,00:26:48.315,Then you open your eyes and you're so damn glad it was a dream.
00:26:56.031,00:26:58.033,This was nothing like that.
00:27:25.060,00:27:27.645,I'm sorry.
00:27:37.406,00:27:38.656,"Oh, shit."
00:27:52.921,00:27:53.839,Hey.
00:27:54.507,00:27:56.133,What's up with you?
00:27:56.758,00:27:58.344,What do you mean?
00:27:59.553,00:28:01.888,You're... You're here early.
00:28:05.058,00:28:06.893,Is... You seem a little pepped up.
00:28:06.935,00:28:09.146,You all right?
00:28:10.230,00:28:11.231,Yeah.
00:28:12.316,00:28:17.695,I guess I feel kind of different.
00:28:17.737,00:28:20.324,Whatever. I'm gonna go get some Post-it Notes.
00:28:20.366,00:28:21.534,No.
00:28:21.575,00:28:23.035,Yeah.
00:28:37.675,00:28:44.181,"Jesus H. fucking Popsicle, I still don't have my billing reports, but you've got time to sit here and Google your ass off."
00:28:44.223,00:28:45.932,"Well, I know one thing."
00:28:45.974,00:28:53.023,"You've got your review coming up next week, and I can't wait to start checking me off some big fucking boxes."
00:28:53.065,00:28:56.985,"Attitude, poor!"
00:28:57.027,00:28:59.321,"Management skills, poor!"
00:28:59.363,00:29:02.491,Works well with others.
00:29:03.909,00:29:06.537,What is this bullshit?
00:29:06.579,00:29:09.331,Some loser gets his head blown off at the Metropolitan...
00:29:09.373,00:29:11.291,Shut the fuck up!
00:29:19.841,00:29:23.178,She has one single iota of tenuous power.
00:29:23.220,00:29:25.805,She thinks she can push everyone around.
00:29:27.433,00:29:29.059,You don't need this.
00:29:37.025,00:29:43.699,"Junior high must have been kind of tough, but it doesn't give you the right to treat your workers like horseshit, Janice."
00:29:43.741,00:29:46.868,"I know we laugh at you, Janice."
00:29:46.910,00:29:49.955,We all know you keep your stash of jelly donuts in the top drawer of your desk.
00:29:49.996,00:29:56.462,"But I want you to know if you weren't such a bitch, we'd feel sorry for you."
00:29:59.089,00:30:01.007,I do feel sorry for you.
00:30:02.217,00:30:13.937,"But as it stands, the way you behave, I feel I can speak for the entire office when I tell you go fuck yourself."
00:30:28.994,00:30:31.371,"Yeah. That was great, bro."
00:30:38.920,00:30:40.046,I'm the man.
00:31:18.168,00:31:20.045,That's a bad idea.
00:31:22.506,00:31:24.341,"Couldn't find your keys, huh?"
00:31:24.383,00:31:25.884,That could be handy.
00:31:25.925,00:31:27.427,I might need that.
00:31:28.846,00:31:32.098,"So, Fox, right?"
00:31:32.140,00:31:35.435,Is it like Maverick in Top Gun?
00:31:35.477,00:31:37.937,"You could tell me, but you'd have to kill me?"
00:32:50.552,00:32:51.595,SLOAN: Peter!
00:32:53.972,00:32:58.685,Check the shuttle rotation on this STB.
00:32:58.727,00:33:01.730,"This kind of cotton weave, the opposing thread count should be 4,000."
00:33:01.772,00:33:04.983,"Hey, this is pretty awesome, huh?"
00:33:06.526,00:33:07.945,Is it a front?
00:33:10.155,00:33:12.616,Front for what?
00:33:12.658,00:33:14.117,Assassinations.
00:33:15.577,00:33:22.584,"You may think this is a front for something, all I can tell you is this is a textile mill."
00:33:22.626,00:33:25.378,And George...
00:33:25.420,00:33:26.379,Yeah.
00:33:28.006,00:33:29.633,This is a textile mill.
00:33:30.258,00:33:31.635,And a damn good one.
00:33:31.677,00:33:34.680,"WESLEY: Yeah, that's cute, but that's bullshit, right?"
00:33:34.721,00:33:37.474,"I mean, all these guys are killers, aren't they?"
00:33:40.268,00:33:42.646,I think you owe me some answers.
00:33:42.688,00:33:45.649,All right.
00:33:42.688,00:33:48.276,"Clearly I don't understand, but do you make sweaters or do you kill people?"
00:34:08.964,00:34:11.675,That's an awful lot of questions over coffee.
00:34:21.184,00:34:23.102,Are you sure you're ready for the answers?
00:34:23.144,00:34:24.604,"Yes, I'm sure."
00:34:25.856,00:34:27.691,I can't go back.
00:34:27.733,00:34:29.192,Not to my life.
00:34:33.947,00:34:35.365,SLOAN: He's all yours.
00:34:36.324,00:34:38.159,All right. We're up.
00:34:48.962,00:34:50.463,How you doing?
00:34:51.798,00:34:53.299,I'm The Repairman.
00:34:53.341,00:34:55.468,What do you repair?
00:34:55.510,00:35:00.057,A lifetime of bad habits.
00:35:00.098,00:35:02.308,Okay.
00:35:02.350,00:35:03.643,Just put your arms behind your back.
00:35:03.685,00:35:04.978,Uh...
00:35:05.020,00:35:07.522,It's okay.
00:35:07.564,00:35:09.024,Just behind your back.
00:35:09.066,00:35:10.650,REPAIRMAN: Just relax.
00:35:10.692,00:35:12.193,WESLEY: Is this part of it?
00:35:13.445,00:35:15.488,REPAIRMAN: There we go.
00:35:15.530,00:35:17.198,You going to put a bag over my head?
00:35:17.240,00:35:19.826,REPAIRMAN: No.
00:35:19.868,00:35:22.704,"That's not too tight, is it?"
00:35:32.130,00:35:34.007,"Why did you come here, Wesley?"
00:35:34.049,00:35:36.802,"Well, you brought me here, remember?"
00:35:36.843,00:35:38.762,did you do that...
00:35:55.112,00:35:58.782,How many punches did The Repairman throw before he was counting sheep?
00:36:01.159,00:36:04.788,"Well, I haven't spent a lot of time having my face smashed in before, all right?"
00:36:04.830,00:36:06.414,Did you spend a lot of time with knives?
00:36:06.456,00:36:09.167,"At breakfast, lunch and dinner."
00:36:10.543,00:36:11.628,Fuck.
00:36:15.799,00:36:18.426,"It was a rhetorical question, culo."
00:36:18.468,00:36:21.346,"You interrupt me again, I use the business end."
00:36:22.597,00:36:24.432,"Here's what you need to know, puto."
00:36:24.474,00:36:26.518,Knives are easy to hide.
00:36:28.770,00:36:31.397,They don't jam and they never run out of bullets.
00:36:32.858,00:36:37.779,They come in handy when you have to do some close contact work.
00:36:37.821,00:36:39.489,"What the fuck, man?"
00:36:47.580,00:36:49.457,Come here. Come here.
00:36:51.501,00:36:53.294,"BUTCHER: Now, try to cut me."
00:36:55.047,00:36:57.924,Try to cut me. Hey!
00:36:57.966,00:37:00.259,Just stick me with that...
00:37:01.887,00:37:04.681,Just stick and stick and stick.
00:37:04.723,00:37:07.225,"Seriously, man, I could hurt you."
00:37:07.266,00:37:09.394,"Okay, pussy."
00:37:09.435,00:37:11.312,I'm not a pussy.
00:37:11.354,00:37:13.231,"No, I'm not a pussy."
00:37:13.272,00:37:16.234,I'm not a pussy.
00:37:16.275,00:37:17.986,"Fuck that, you pussy!"
00:37:18.028,00:37:19.154,You're a pussy!
00:37:19.196,00:37:21.364,"Come on, pussy."
00:37:43.845,00:37:45.680,Hi. How you doing?
00:37:45.722,00:37:47.682,What the fuck?
00:37:48.349,00:37:49.768,The fuck!
00:37:49.809,00:37:51.728,Just a moment.
00:37:53.312,00:37:54.647,Sorry.
00:37:54.689,00:37:56.524,Hello? Hey!
00:37:56.566,00:37:58.568,"Hey, come back! Hey!"
00:37:59.402,00:38:01.404,You must drink.
00:38:08.870,00:38:12.582,What is this?
00:38:12.624,00:38:17.003,This bath stimulates white blood cells and speed up the process.
00:38:17.045,00:38:20.840,"In here, bruises, cuts, breaks heal in hours, not days."
00:38:20.882,00:38:21.758,You shitting me?
00:38:21.800,00:38:23.301,Shh.
00:38:24.594,00:38:26.304,What is that? Vodka?
00:38:26.345,00:38:27.973,Are you Russian?
00:38:29.307,00:38:30.516,Get up.
00:38:32.435,00:38:34.604,This is The Gunsmith.
00:38:34.646,00:38:39.192,"He knows more about a piece than anybody, and he's gonna teach you how to use one."
00:38:39.234,00:38:41.278,How you doing?
00:38:43.071,00:38:46.365,You know that Seltzer broke his leg?
00:38:46.407,00:38:48.285,"Yeah, in three places."
00:38:49.911,00:38:53.456,FOX: How'd he do that?
00:38:53.498,00:38:56.835,"So, is he okay?"
00:38:56.876,00:38:59.337,"Oh, my God."
00:38:59.378,00:39:01.840,"Oh, my God, you guys, that is so realistic."
00:39:03.925,00:39:09.055,"He's been in recovery for, like, three days now, and they say they're not even gonna let him out."
00:39:18.857,00:39:20.441,"Oh, my God."
00:39:21.860,00:39:23.028,"Oh, my God."
00:39:23.778,00:39:25.363,"Oh, my God!"
00:39:25.404,00:39:28.616,"Hey, we can't shoot a dead woman! She might be somebody's mom..."
00:39:31.119,00:39:34.331,You need to know what it's like to put a bullet in a body.
00:39:34.956,00:39:37.625,FOX: Why are you here?
00:39:37.667,00:39:41.546,"You know, I thought I was learning to be some kind of super assassin."
00:39:43.340,00:39:47.344,"You know, if I wanted to get beat up, I would have stayed in my cubicle, you know."
00:39:54.642,00:39:55.685,Fuck.
00:40:07.280,00:40:08.990,"FOX: All right, shoot the target."
00:40:09.949,00:40:11.368,From there.
00:40:12.785,00:40:14.371,You want me shoot through Wilbur?
00:40:14.412,00:40:16.706,I want you to curve the bullet.
00:40:17.790,00:40:20.252,How am I suppose to do that?
00:40:20.293,00:40:24.964,"It's not a question of how, it's a question of what."
00:40:25.006,00:40:31.971,"If no one told you that bullets flew straight and I gave you a gun and told you to hit the target, what would you do?"
00:40:33.306,00:40:35.433,Let your instincts guide you.
00:40:49.781,00:40:52.117,How the hell did he do that?
00:40:52.158,00:40:54.702,Can you do that?
00:40:59.291,00:41:01.042,"Hey, I think that's my old train."
00:41:01.084,00:41:02.168,Still is.
00:41:11.552,00:41:14.264,Shit! You fucking asshole!
00:41:14.306,00:41:15.598,Come on!
00:41:20.103,00:41:21.687,Let's go.
00:41:21.729,00:41:23.856,Are you out of your fucking mind?
00:41:35.076,00:41:38.496,"Oh, shit. Oh, shit."
00:41:57.598,00:42:01.686,"Oh, God, I feel..."
00:42:01.727,00:42:03.480,I feel kind of good.
00:42:11.863,00:42:15.574,GUNSMITH: He got Rictus.
00:42:16.826,00:42:19.078,Cross is taking us out one by one.
00:42:24.709,00:42:27.212,And Wesley is the only one who can get to him.
00:42:29.297,00:42:31.549,Cross gets closer with each hour.
00:42:34.177,00:42:35.678,Get back to work.
00:42:39.140,00:42:40.225,FOX: See that?
00:42:40.933,00:42:42.727,It's a shuttle.
00:42:44.145,00:42:46.189,I want you to try and catch it.
00:42:47.648,00:42:49.359,You want me to stick my hand in there?
00:42:49.401,00:42:51.152,Yes. I want you to catch it.
00:43:01.329,00:43:02.872,You wanna put a gun to my head?
00:43:02.914,00:43:04.957,I can just slow things down like with the flies.
00:43:04.999,00:43:07.544,You need to learn to control that by yourself.
00:43:22.517,00:43:23.935,"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"
00:43:24.727,00:43:26.771,This is bullshit! Fuck this!
00:43:37.656,00:43:39.658,"How's it going today, Wesley?"
00:43:39.700,00:43:42.912,No. Fuck the loom and fuck The Repairman!
00:43:42.954,00:43:46.707,I can shoot the wings off the back of a fly!
00:43:46.749,00:43:48.876,You're ready when Fox says you're ready.
00:43:48.918,00:43:51.087,Who put her in charge?
00:43:56.259,00:43:57.302,Wesley.
00:44:02.557,00:44:05.602,People think you use cheese to catch these beauties.
00:44:05.643,00:44:09.063,But they go apeshit for peanut butter.
00:44:09.105,00:44:12.817,Your father was a big fan of this.
00:44:16.571,00:44:18.906,Plastic explosive and peanut butter!
00:44:19.782,00:44:21.200,"Sorry, Mickey."
00:44:23.328,00:44:25.997,"Five, four, three, two, one."
00:44:34.297,00:44:36.007,"Hey. Hey, Russian."
00:44:38.635,00:44:41.179,Good for one. Yeah.
00:44:41.220,00:44:43.306,Imagine if you had a thousand.
00:44:45.724,00:44:48.144,"They really fucked you up, didn't they?"
00:44:48.978,00:44:51.648,What the hell did they do to you?
00:44:51.688,00:44:54.733,Throw you in front of a moving train for no reason?
00:44:54.775,00:44:58.112,Beat the shit out of you?
00:44:58.154,00:45:03.075,"You know, you can say it, this place is bullshit."
00:45:03.117,00:45:04.577,Bullshit!
00:45:13.378,00:45:15.171,Repairman. Five minutes.
00:45:17.965,00:45:20.092,Heads up out of the question?
00:45:26.098,00:45:27.600,Fuck.
00:45:27.642,00:45:29.810,You're a waste of my fucking time!
00:45:29.852,00:45:31.812,"I don't know, so hit me."
00:45:41.447,00:45:44.783,Why are you here?
00:45:46.743,00:45:48.871,I wanna kick your fucking ass!
00:45:49.997,00:45:51.957,Tell me what you want me to say.
00:45:51.999,00:45:54.210,FOX: Why are you here?
00:45:57.463,00:45:58.964,Why are you here?
00:46:00.592,00:46:02.801,Why are you here?
00:46:02.843,00:46:04.387,Why are you here?
00:46:07.682,00:46:08.807,Why are you here?
00:46:08.849,00:46:11.894,I don't know who I am.
00:46:17.149,00:46:19.068,What did you say?
00:46:20.194,00:46:22.238,I said I don't know who I am.
00:46:37.211,00:46:39.464,Do you really want to know who you are?
00:46:51.934,00:46:53.810,Yeah. It's my room.
00:46:54.395,00:46:55.438,No.
00:46:57.607,00:46:59.358,This was your father's room.
00:47:12.789,00:47:14.165,WESLEY: What happened?
00:47:15.333,00:47:17.834,A member of this fraternity went rogue.
00:47:18.336,00:47:19.378,Cross.
00:47:22.757,00:47:25.926,He started by killing the one man who was better than him.
00:47:27.345,00:47:28.471,Your father.
00:47:31.390,00:47:33.309,Blindsided him on a rooftop.
00:47:34.435,00:47:35.812,Betrayed him.
00:47:39.023,00:47:47.072,"Everything in this room, books, weapons, clothes, belonged to him."
00:47:47.114,00:47:49.116,Now they belong to you.
00:47:50.618,00:47:52.995,"Find a connection in this room, Wesley."
00:47:54.580,00:47:57.500,It may be the only way of finding out who you are.
00:48:18.020,00:48:21.232,WESLEY: Now I know why I could never care about anything before this.
00:48:22.483,00:48:24.026,I was living a lie.
00:48:25.944,00:48:29.741,"Finally, I have a chance to step into my father's shoes."
00:48:29.782,00:48:34.203,Grow a pair.
00:48:34.245,00:48:37.956,I've been pissing it all away like it was another fucking billing report.
00:48:37.998,00:48:39.958,I have to train harder.
00:48:40.000,00:48:42.211,I have to be as good as my father.
00:48:51.470,00:48:58.477,"On these shelves, Wesley, are the records of the Fraternity kills, everything you will need to kill your target."
00:48:58.519,00:49:06.151,"WESLEY: To kill Cross, the man who betrayed the Fraternity and murdered my father, I must prepare."
00:49:06.193,00:49:12.491,"I have to become his student, memorize every move he ever made, every attack he ever executed."
00:49:20.750,00:49:25.296,When he dropped a patient in an airtight room surrounded by Secret Service agents.
00:49:25.337,00:49:27.924,When he took out that businessman in the elevator.
00:49:27.964,00:49:29.634,"His bullets untraceable, of course."
00:49:33.053,00:49:41.186,"Or how no matter what the weapon or how he eliminated his target, he was always one chess move ahead."
00:49:42.772,00:49:45.065,One move more prepared.
00:49:45.107,00:49:47.025,One step quicker.
00:49:47.067,00:49:49.986,One shot more precise.
00:49:50.028,00:49:53.699,"In fact, in all my research, I found that he never missed a target."
00:49:54.826,00:49:56.243,Not until me.
00:51:03.769,00:51:05.021,Yeah!
00:51:53.027,00:51:57.073,"First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control."
00:52:35.402,00:52:36.821,Shoot the target.
00:52:49.000,00:52:50.375,You're crazy.
00:53:39.424,00:53:41.468,Welcome to the Fraternity.
00:53:53.647,00:53:56.192,SLOAN: We call this the Loom of Fate.
00:54:08.579,00:54:12.875,"After today, you will never set foot in here again."
00:54:12.917,00:54:14.877,Why not?
00:54:14.919,00:54:21.383,"Because, like an apostle, your task is not to interpret, but to deliver."
00:54:24.511,00:54:30.266,"Every culture in history has a secret code, one you won't find in traditional texts."
00:54:31.852,00:54:37.942,"A thousand years ago, a clan of weavers discovered a mystical language hidden in the fabric."
00:54:39.818,00:54:43.405,They called themselves the Fraternity.
00:54:43.447,00:54:45.616,"I'll be honest with you, all I see are threads."
00:54:46.951,00:54:48.244,Come here.
00:54:52.248,00:54:53.624,Look there.
00:54:55.167,00:54:58.837,Do you see that one thread that missed the weave and lies on top of the others?
00:54:58.879,00:55:01.590,Like a mistake?
00:55:02.883,00:55:05.803,"If the vertical thread is on top, it's a one."
00:55:07.221,00:55:09.389,"If it's below, it's a zero."
00:55:10.348,00:55:11.809,Binary code?
00:55:12.810,00:55:14.812,What does it say?
00:55:14.853,00:55:16.272,It's a name.
00:55:17.231,00:55:18.565,A target.
00:55:21.110,00:55:22.945,Where do the names come from?
00:55:24.155,00:55:26.907,"Come out of a necessity, Wesley."
00:55:26.949,00:55:30.535,A necessity to maintain balance in the world.
00:55:30.577,00:55:38.836,"They are orders that must be executed, entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos."
00:55:41.505,00:55:43.465,This one is yours.
00:55:47.761,00:55:48.887,I don't...
00:55:51.431,00:55:53.767,"Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross."
00:55:53.809,00:55:55.019,You will.
00:55:55.060,00:55:56.478,In time.
00:55:58.272,00:56:00.274,This is your first assignment.
00:56:00.316,00:56:05.821,"The loom provides, I interpret, you deliver."
00:56:07.447,00:56:10.617,You want me to kill Robert Deane Darden?
00:56:12.036,00:56:13.329,Not me.
00:56:14.872,00:56:15.873,Fate.
00:56:23.797,00:56:27.343,"FOX: The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair."
00:56:27.383,00:56:29.887,There are six windows.
00:56:29.928,00:56:32.388,You will shoot through the fifth.
00:56:42.149,00:56:43.567,Fifth window.
00:56:51.075,00:56:52.117,Now.
00:57:16.516,00:57:18.685,WESLEY: What did he do that he deserves to die?
00:57:19.895,00:57:21.397,You don't know.
00:57:22.981,00:57:25.901,"I don't know if he was bad, I don't know if he was evil."
00:57:26.735,00:57:28.904,I don't know anything about him.
00:57:30.322,00:57:32.490,We get our orders from a loom.
00:57:33.325,00:57:35.327,Fate.
00:57:35.369,00:57:39.039,And we're suppose to take it on faith that what we're doing is right.
00:57:40.916,00:57:47.756,"Killing someone we know nothing about, I don't know if I can do that."
00:58:00.311,00:58:05.441,"About 20 years ago, there was this girl."
00:58:06.733,00:58:14.116,"Her dad was a federal judge, so she probably had it in her mind that she was gonna follow in his footsteps."
00:58:19.830,00:58:25.543,"So she's home one Christmas, and her dad's on this big racketeering case."
00:58:25.585,00:58:28.213,The defendants want to get a softer judge.
00:58:29.089,00:58:30.799,One they can buy off.
00:58:32.092,00:58:40.934,"So they hire this guy, Max Petridge, get him to pay her father a visit."
00:58:44.396,00:59:00.078,"And the way he pays people a visit is to break in and tie up their loved ones, and force them to watch while he burns his targets alive."
00:59:09.880,00:59:18.680,And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it round and brands his initials into each one of them so they will never ever forget.
00:59:23.935,00:59:37.991,"After I was recruited into the Fraternity, I found out that Max Petridge's name had come up weeks before the federal judge was killed, and that a Fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger."
00:59:42.662,00:59:45.582,We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go.
00:59:48.001,00:59:52.548,"You kill one, and maybe, save a thousand."
00:59:53.965,00:59:56.885,That's the code of the Fraternity.
00:59:56.927,01:00:00.055,"That's what we believe in, and that's why we do it."
01:00:21.243,01:00:22.244,Now!
01:01:07.164,01:01:08.499,Cross.
01:01:08.540,01:01:09.707,Not yet.
01:01:12.877,01:01:15.380,FOX: Your target will be in a black limo.
01:01:15.422,01:01:17.882,He always travels the same six blocks of Halsted.
01:01:17.924,01:01:19.717,You have three blocks to kill him.
01:01:28.310,01:01:29.311,Shit.
01:02:12.688,01:02:14.731,I'm sorry.
01:02:32.999,01:02:35.126,CATHY: Barry!
01:02:36.211,01:02:37.379,Barry!
01:02:41.425,01:02:45.887,"Wesley. Hey, where have you been?"
01:02:49.099,01:02:52.310,Look at the big man.
01:02:52.352,01:02:56.314,"What? You don't show up for weeks, now you're just gonna stop by and use the bathroom?"
01:02:56.356,01:02:58.983,"You think you're a real big shot now, huh?"
01:02:59.025,01:03:01.486,No. You know what?
01:03:01.528,01:03:04.239,"No, you are less than nothing."
01:03:04.281,01:03:07.825,You're not even half the man that Barry is.
01:03:07.867,01:03:11.413,"Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of!"
01:03:16.042,01:03:19.170,"Who the hell is she, Wesley?"
01:03:19.212,01:03:22.257,Is that what it takes now?
01:03:54.623,01:03:55.957,Wesley?
01:03:57.626,01:03:58.960,He's the man.
01:04:08.094,01:04:10.472,You all right?
01:04:10.514,01:04:13.891,Yeah. I'm okay.
01:04:13.933,01:04:16.394,Big night.
01:04:32.786,01:04:34.037,Shit.
01:04:39.835,01:04:41.002,Fuck!
01:06:21.770,01:06:23.062,Bull's-eye.
01:06:25.398,01:06:26.942,REPAIRMAN: What's he doing here?
01:06:46.252,01:06:48.212,Come on!
01:06:48.254,01:06:49.464,FOX: Pull back his jacket.
01:06:54.427,01:06:57.054,"REPAIRMAN: Breathe. Breathe, all right?"
01:07:00.475,01:07:03.895,FOX: It's all right.
01:07:03.937,01:07:05.146,A thousand.
01:07:05.188,01:07:06.439,REPAIRMAN: Come on!
01:07:08.441,01:07:10.568,Come on!
01:07:10.610,01:07:11.736,Come on.
01:07:11.778,01:07:12.988,REPAIRMAN: Come on!
01:07:13.989,01:07:15.072,Come on!
01:07:16.449,01:07:17.617,Come on!
01:08:08.543,01:08:11.546,This bullet is the first traceable bullet he's ever used.
01:08:13.464,01:08:16.843,It was made by this man.
01:08:16.885,01:08:20.304,He works out of what is now a monastery in Eastern Moravia.
01:08:20.346,01:08:22.766,This place is where the Fraternity was born.
01:08:28.021,01:08:30.065,He's taunting me.
01:08:30.106,01:08:32.191,He's sending me a message.
01:08:32.233,01:08:33.818,I'm gonna send him one back.
01:08:33.860,01:08:36.071,He's trapping you.
01:08:36.112,01:08:38.197,Leading you to a place he knows very well.
01:08:38.239,01:08:40.075,"Look, I know this. I..."
01:08:42.410,01:08:44.871,This is what you trained me for.
01:08:44.913,01:08:46.623,You can't go alone.
01:08:46.664,01:08:50.126,I go alone or he doesn't show.
01:08:50.167,01:08:54.422,"Look, a member of the Fraternity is dead because of me."
01:09:00.095,01:09:01.137,SLOAN: Okay.
01:09:03.598,01:09:04.515,Go.
01:09:08.561,01:09:09.771,Thank you.
01:09:17.904,01:09:20.281,I don't think that's a good idea.
01:09:30.166,01:09:31.793,Your next assignment.
01:10:31.644,01:10:32.770,Pekwarsky?
01:10:48.161,01:10:49.204,WESLEY: Shit.
01:10:57.253,01:10:59.672,What are you doing here?
01:10:59.714,01:11:01.257,FOX: Lower your gun.
01:11:12.560,01:11:14.395,WESLEY: You recognize this?
01:11:15.312,01:11:16.814,I pulled this out of my shoulder.
01:11:16.856,01:11:19.650,The guy who put it there killed my father.
01:11:19.692,01:11:21.986,"Now, I know you made it, so tell me where he is."
01:11:22.028,01:11:25.823,"I did mold this, but I can't be responsible for the people who use them."
01:11:25.865,01:11:28.701,I don't give a shit.
01:11:28.743,01:11:30.245,Look at my finger.
01:11:32.163,01:11:34.832,I can try and arrange a meet.
01:11:58.564,01:12:01.358,Have you ever thought about doing things differently?
01:12:01.400,01:12:03.111,How do you mean?
01:12:03.153,01:12:04.612,I don't know.
01:12:05.696,01:12:07.740,Being somebody else.
01:12:09.033,01:12:10.701,Somebody normal.
01:12:17.917,01:12:18.876,No.
01:12:25.008,01:12:25.967,Shit.
01:12:28.052,01:12:29.512,Out of the way!
01:12:59.959,01:13:00.960,Stay.
01:13:21.939,01:13:22.899,Hey!
01:13:25.360,01:13:26.986,He's on the train.
01:13:27.528,01:13:28.863,He's alone.
01:13:29.322,01:13:30.698,Thank you.
01:13:54.347,01:13:56.140,Sorry. I'm sorry. Sit down!
01:13:56.182,01:13:58.935,"Sir, sit down!"
01:13:58.976,01:14:01.520,"Sir, sit... Sit down!"
01:14:14.033,01:14:16.786,Get out of the way! Sit down!
01:14:16.827,01:14:18.413,Stay down! It's okay!
01:14:39.058,01:14:41.018,Out of the way!
01:15:52.589,01:15:54.091,"WESLEY: No, no, no!"
01:18:30.247,01:18:32.749,"Wesley, listen to me."
01:18:32.791,01:18:34.960,Shut the fuck up!
01:18:35.002,01:18:37.171,You don't get to talk to me.
01:18:37.213,01:18:39.048,You don't get to talk to me.
01:18:39.089,01:18:42.677,Everything they told you was a lie.
01:18:42.718,01:18:45.721,"Shut up, you lying piece of shit."
01:18:46.722,01:18:48.432,You are my son.
01:18:53.521,01:18:55.022,What did you say?
01:18:55.731,01:18:57.733,What did you say to me?
01:19:29.557,01:19:30.891,Is it true?
01:19:33.519,01:19:34.770,Yes.
01:19:39.191,01:19:41.193,Why did you make me do this?
01:19:41.235,01:19:43.904,Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill.
01:19:48.909,01:19:50.994,"You knew, God damn it."
01:19:51.036,01:19:52.996,You knew the entire time.
01:19:54.373,01:19:56.083,"Well, his name came up."
01:19:58.210,01:19:59.754,So did yours.
01:20:46.049,01:20:48.051,"No, it was okay."
01:20:49.720,01:20:52.139,"No. No, it was complete shit."
01:21:13.327,01:21:15.245,I promised your father I'd bring you back here.
01:21:15.287,01:21:16.539,What the fuck?
01:21:18.123,01:21:20.917,He said it was the only way you'd believe.
01:21:28.801,01:21:31.470,Your father was never more than a camera click away.
01:21:48.738,01:21:50.030,That's me.
01:21:54.451,01:21:56.036,He was my father.
01:21:58.455,01:22:00.457,And I killed him.
01:22:00.499,01:22:04.294,"To your father, protecting you was worth giving up his life."
01:22:05.671,01:22:08.131,Protect me?
01:22:08.173,01:22:10.509,He was trying to fucking kill me!
01:22:10.551,01:22:13.929,No. He wasn't trying to kill you.
01:22:14.930,01:22:16.891,He was trying to rescue you.
01:22:23.188,01:22:27.401,"PEKWARSKY: When Cross left the Fraternity, Sloan hunted you down."
01:22:29.986,01:22:34.074,"Ever since Fox had her teeth in you, he's been trying to separate you from them."
01:22:37.411,01:22:40.289,"Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley."
01:22:41.957,01:22:52.217,"He wanted a different path for you, with things that he could never have."
01:22:52.885,01:22:54.261,A home.
01:22:55.345,01:22:57.848,Peace.
01:22:57.890,01:23:00.392,He hoped you would find your own way.
01:23:07.232,01:23:09.318,Your father got hold of this.
01:23:11.570,01:23:13.280,Decipher it yourself.
01:23:21.079,01:23:25.125,Sloan began manufacturing targets of his own for profit years ago.
01:23:27.294,01:23:30.297,Your father found out about it.
01:23:30.339,01:23:32.508,"And he was going to do something about it on his own, right?"
01:23:32.549,01:23:35.636,But Sloan turned everyone against him.
01:23:35.678,01:23:38.138,"My father's name never even came up, did it?"
01:23:38.180,01:23:40.641,No. Holding to the code made him a target.
01:23:45.604,01:23:46.480,Yes.
01:24:01.161,01:24:03.330,You want me to run?
01:24:04.164,01:24:05.708,I want you to live.
01:24:07.459,01:24:10.045,"You can have a different life, Wesley."
01:24:11.171,01:24:13.382,Like your father wanted for you.
01:25:40.343,01:25:42.137,We trained him well.
01:26:26.556,01:26:28.517,WESLEY: My father was wrong about one thing.
01:26:28.558,01:26:31.561,Everything they told me wasn't a lie.
01:26:31.603,01:26:38.485,"They taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain, and most importantly, that every job has a perfect weapon."
01:26:42.238,01:26:44.574,"Well, I'm the perfect weapon."
01:26:46.910,01:26:49.121,And I'm supposed to run?
01:26:49.163,01:26:51.373,"No, I've been doing that my entire life."
01:26:52.041,01:26:54.835,So I say no.
01:26:54.877,01:26:57.754,I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess.
01:27:52.809,01:27:53.936,Kill him.
01:28:47.239,01:28:48.531,He's here!
01:31:58.638,01:31:59.848,BUTCHER: Pussy.
01:32:01.308,01:32:02.934,"Pussy, pussy."
01:32:17.491,01:32:18.825,"Pussy, pussy."
01:32:23.955,01:32:25.081,Pussy.
01:33:30.522,01:33:32.899,Sloan!
01:33:50.917,01:33:53.086,My father wasn't a traitor.
01:33:56.714,01:33:58.300,This is a kill order.
01:34:01.470,01:34:03.305,And it's got Sloan's name on it.
01:34:06.933,01:34:08.810,What did you say to me?
01:34:09.685,01:34:11.771,It's a name. It's a target.
01:34:14.983,01:34:17.110,I don't want this person dead.
01:34:18.194,01:34:19.613,Fate does.
01:34:27.454,01:34:29.414,And he couldn't take it.
01:34:29.456,01:34:34.252,So he started manufacturing his own targets for his own gains.
01:34:34.294,01:34:37.839,And that's when my dad found out and decided to stand against him.
01:34:39.341,01:34:44.678,And that's when you sent a man's son to kill his father.
01:34:48.183,01:34:50.644,"You're not an assassin of fate, Sloan."
01:34:52.812,01:34:55.106,You're just a thug who can bend bullets.
01:35:11.665,01:35:13.166,Is that true?
01:35:20.423,01:35:22.258,Here is what the truth is.
01:35:26.555,01:35:27.972,Your name came up.
01:35:39.401,01:35:40.860,Your name came up.
01:35:56.334,01:35:57.877,Your name came up.
01:35:59.921,01:36:01.172,Your name.
01:36:02.840,01:36:04.217,Your name.
01:36:04.926,01:36:06.219,Yours.
01:36:07.554,01:36:09.763,Everyone in this room.
01:36:15.437,01:36:22.068,"If I had not done what I did, you would all be dead."
01:36:24.820,01:36:26.780,I saved your lives.
01:36:28.866,01:36:32.287,Now look where we are.
01:36:34.122,01:36:36.458,Changing the course of history as we see it.
01:36:39.001,01:36:40.962,Choosing the targets we select.
01:36:43.381,01:36:46.926,We can redistribute power where we see fit.
01:36:49.596,01:36:51.013,The wolves rule.
01:36:52.932,01:36:54.392,Not the sheep.
01:36:56.936,01:37:09.949,"Now, if any of you feel the need to follow the code of the Fraternity to the letter, I invite you to take your gun, put it in your mouth and pull the trigger."
01:37:14.245,01:37:16.205,That is what Wesley demands.
01:37:17.915,01:37:27.925,"Otherwise, shoot this motherfucker and let us take our Fraternity of Assassins to heights reserved only for the gods of men."
01:37:31.887,01:37:33.139,You choose.
01:37:48.363,01:37:49.863,Fuck the code.
01:38:53.595,01:38:55.346,Sloan!
01:39:20.622,01:39:23.207,Sloan!
01:39:39.973,01:39:43.269,"WESLEY: Six weeks ago, I was ordinary and pathetic."
01:39:45.605,01:39:47.106,Just like you.
01:39:50.401,01:39:52.027,But who am I now?
01:39:54.572,01:39:56.115,Account manager?
01:39:58.660,01:39:59.661,Assassin?
01:40:02.163,01:40:06.041,Or just another tool who was mind-fucked into killing his father?
01:40:08.127,01:40:09.545,I am all of these.
01:40:11.046,01:40:12.548,And I am none of these.
01:40:15.593,01:40:17.010,Who am I now?
01:40:48.668,01:40:51.212,This is not me fulfilling my destiny.
01:40:56.718,01:40:59.178,This is not me following in my father's footsteps.
01:41:04.099,01:41:06.602,This is definitely not me saving the world.
01:41:25.663,01:41:28.123,Still trying to figure out who you are?
01:41:29.291,01:41:31.335,WESLEY: This is not me.
01:41:34.505,01:41:36.674,This is just a motherfucking decoy.
01:41:43.556,01:41:44.640,"Oh, fuck."
01:41:49.478,01:41:51.606,This is me taking control.
01:41:53.148,01:42:07.747,"From Sloan, from the Fraternity, from Janice, from billing reports, from ergonomic keyboards, from cheating girlfriends and sack-of-shit best friends."
01:42:09.874,01:42:14.670,This is me taking back control of my life.
01:42:18.716,01:42:20.718,What the fuck have you done lately?
