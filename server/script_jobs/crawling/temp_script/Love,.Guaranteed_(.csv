00:00:28.041,00:00:36.750,"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is time to rip off the blindfold and let justice see."
00:00:41.083,00:00:44.208,"Sorry, honey, you were really on a roll, but I got court in ten, so..."
00:00:45.125,00:00:46.875,I am liking that second version.
00:00:48.000,00:00:50.833,I should use the basement ladies' room more often.
00:00:51.208,00:00:52.875,It's where all the magic happens.
00:01:01.875,00:01:04.250,"A widower, starting to date again."
00:01:05.000,00:01:11.083,"Crossing items off his bucket list, like zipping around town on one of those hip electric scooters."
00:01:11.833,00:01:18.208,What was not on his list was a broken hip from being sideswiped by a city bus on Pike Street.
00:01:19.083,00:01:28.750,"The Seattle Transit Authority thwarts victims from pursuing damages by overwhelming them with confusing, endless, bureaucratic red tape."
00:01:29.250,00:01:33.708,They count on justice to turn a blind eye.
00:01:34.625,00:01:41.291,But it is time to rip off the blindfold and let justice see.
00:01:47.375,00:01:49.250,"You saved my heinie in there, kid."
00:01:49.625,00:01:51.250,I'll find a way to pay you back.
00:01:51.500,00:01:53.500,-I promise. -Don't worry about it.
00:01:54.041,00:01:55.125,Just get home safe.
00:01:55.708,00:01:57.291,All right.
00:02:01.208,00:02:03.125,"Nah, I ghosted her. She gone."
00:02:04.583,00:02:05.708,Nothing but net.
00:02:10.625,00:02:12.291,"Excuse me, you... um..."
00:03:22.125,00:03:24.541,"-Hey, sis! How'd it go? -Hey."
00:03:24.875,00:03:26.166,Score one for the good guys.
00:03:28.000,00:03:31.333,Want to come over and celebrate? Gideon's teaching Oliver to make pizza.
00:03:34.250,00:03:35.458,We might be ordering that pizza.
00:03:35.916,00:03:41.833,"Uh... you know, I would. But I'm just kinda beat, and I got a full inbox calling my name, so, rain check?"
00:03:42.291,00:03:43.333,Game night Friday.
00:03:43.708,00:03:44.916,"Yes, definitely."
00:03:45.000,00:03:47.541,Monopoly money's the only kind I'm going to be seeing this week.
00:03:49.416,00:03:50.333,-See ya. -Bye!
00:04:59.083,00:05:00.166,"and, yep, more rain."
00:05:01.875,00:05:04.625,And now it's time for the KNVB radio traffic report.
00:05:10.458,00:05:12.458,"No, Ms. Kapoor, just, just slow down."
00:05:12.625,00:05:13.875,"Okay, what's happening?"
00:05:15.958,00:05:18.750,"No, your landlord can not put a padlock on your front door."
00:05:18.833,00:05:21.416,Double espresso for Nick. Pumpkin spice latte for Susan.
00:05:21.500,00:05:23.375,"Yes. Yes, I'm sure."
00:05:24.208,00:05:26.750,"Yes. No, I don't care what the notice says."
00:05:27.416,00:05:28.250,I'm positive.
00:05:28.916,00:05:31.500,"And it's not just immoral, by the way, it's illegal."
00:05:31.750,00:05:42.208,"Yes. All right, well I'm gonna get into it with his lawyer Yes. I'm so sorry this is happening, you know, it's not-- -Oh. -I'm so sorry, I just didn't see you."
00:05:42.625,00:05:44.250,Guess they forgot to patch me in.
00:05:45.333,00:05:46.208,Uh...
00:05:46.291,00:05:47.125,Okay.
00:05:47.791,00:05:49.041,"No, I'm still here."
00:05:49.416,00:05:51.666,"Yes, I will call you as soon as I can."
00:05:57.708,00:05:58.541,What?
00:05:58.916,00:06:01.250,Pumpkin spice latte. No pumpkin in it.
00:06:01.708,00:06:03.333,-Just pumpkin flavoring. -Hmm.
00:06:03.875,00:06:10.166,"Every fall, the coffee industry acts like some bountiful pumpkin harvest just came in, so they can peddle their drinks to the masses."
00:06:10.708,00:06:11.875,You're drinking a lie.
00:06:12.833,00:06:14.458,Why are you still talking to me?
00:06:14.541,00:06:16.458,"I dunno, we're walking in the same direction?"
00:06:16.541,00:06:18.500,"Better to make conversation than have awkward silence, right?"
00:06:18.583,00:06:21.333,This is neither. This is an awkward conversation.
00:06:21.416,00:06:23.250,Well... then it's both.
00:06:32.291,00:06:36.166,-Can I help you with something? -The door? I have a 9 a.m. appointment.
00:06:37.958,00:06:40.083,-Welcome to Whitaker and Associates. -Thank you.
00:06:46.833,00:06:48.416,-Yay! -Woohoo!
00:06:51.875,00:06:53.583,Where's the water cooler going?
00:06:53.958,00:06:56.250,"The wave was part celebration, part smoke screen."
00:06:56.375,00:07:00.083,"Turns out, pro bono is Latin for tap water."
00:07:00.291,00:07:03.166,"If you're gonna work for free, I have to make budget cuts."
00:07:04.500,00:07:05.333,Bye.
00:07:08.541,00:07:09.500,Is it my birthday?
00:07:10.375,00:07:12.708,You must be Nick Evans. Nick is your 9 a.m..
00:07:13.500,00:07:14.375,This is awkward.
00:07:16.583,00:07:20.291,"So... how can I help you, Mr. Evans?"
00:07:20.375,00:07:22.083,I need a lawyer.
00:07:22.166,00:07:27.125,And you have a reputation of being one of the classiest bus bench lawyers in town.
00:07:27.208,00:07:28.916,Never done a bus bench ad.
00:07:29.000,00:07:30.375,"Oh, I'm sorry, what is it?"
00:07:30.458,00:07:32.875,Is it ambulance chaser? Is that what it's called?
00:07:35.583,00:07:37.625,"That's cool. Alright, well, how much you charge?"
00:07:45.291,00:07:46.958,I want to sue Love Guaranteed.
00:07:49.333,00:07:51.791,Okay. Were you threatened on a date?
00:07:52.083,00:07:53.208,Stalked? Harmed?
00:07:53.291,00:07:55.083,Worse. I'm a victim of fraud.
00:07:56.250,00:08:02.791,"-Sorry? -Love Guaranteed is robbing people of 29.95 a month with their slogan, You'll find love, guaranteed."
00:08:03.000,00:08:07.875,"Well, I've been on 986 different dates, and not one of them has provided me love."
00:08:07.958,00:08:11.500,Nine hundred and eighty-six dates with...
00:08:12.125,00:08:13.500,actual human women?
00:08:13.583,00:08:20.125,"Yes, the user agreement fine print states that a subscriber must go on 1000 different dates for the guarantee to apply."
00:08:20.750,00:08:23.375,"Their lawyers clearly thought no one would go through with it, but..."
00:08:26.083,00:08:28.708,"Well, home stretch anyways, I got like a dozen to go."
00:08:28.958,00:08:30.166,"Yeah, I'm just..."
00:08:30.666,00:08:36.375,still a little in the weeds on this whole 986 dates of it all.
00:08:36.500,00:08:38.125,Uh... how is that even possible?
00:08:38.916,00:08:42.166,"It's a great question. Uh, breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates."
00:08:44.458,00:08:45.500,"Guy's gotta eat, right?"
00:08:45.583,00:08:52.750,"Did it ever occur to you that maybe love was never found because no woman wants to hear Guy's gotta eat, right?"
00:08:52.833,00:08:56.208,"I'm not saying it at the date. I'm not like, Hey, guy's gotta eat."
00:08:56.291,00:08:59.541,"I'm not doing that, that's not what I'm doing. I'm thinking it in my head."
00:08:59.791,00:09:02.166,"Look, the point is, I have a case."
00:09:02.625,00:09:04.250,"Okay, a winnable case."
00:09:04.333,00:09:06.333,I didn't pass the bar yesterday.
00:09:10.500,00:09:13.000,This is a classic gotcha lawsuit.
00:09:13.250,00:09:15.291,"Find a loophole, take the easy cash."
00:09:16.041,00:09:20.458,"Think what you want, but Love Guaranteed is profiting off the lonely souls of the world."
00:09:20.708,00:09:21.666,It is not right.
00:09:21.750,00:09:25.500,It is reckless endangerment of the human heart and I will not stand for it.
00:09:27.333,00:09:28.166,It's good.
00:09:29.458,00:09:32.333,"So, how much for a retainer?"
00:09:32.750,00:09:36.916,Let me review the merits of your case first.
00:09:37.000,00:09:39.000,Go ahead. Don't take too long.
00:09:40.458,00:09:44.583,Pretty sure your team would like the return of their water cooler.
00:10:06.750,00:10:08.416,Someone looks like they could use a cocktail.
00:10:10.458,00:10:12.125,Oh. What else we got?
00:10:13.791,00:10:15.791,"and oh hey, look, more bills."
00:10:16.166,00:10:18.916,Mr. Bahar wants to defer payment another month.
00:10:19.291,00:10:22.083,And there's a scary-looking envelope from the landlord.
00:10:22.166,00:10:25.750,"But I did put a Bed Bath and Beyond coupon in there, so it's not all bad news."
00:10:25.833,00:10:28.083,"-You're doing the Lord's work, Denise. -Thank you."
00:10:28.291,00:10:29.750,He's raising the rent.
00:10:31.666,00:10:32.708,We'll be fine.
00:10:33.708,00:10:34.541,Say something.
00:10:34.625,00:10:35.875,Is our goldfish okay?
00:10:36.291,00:10:37.250,He's sleeping.
00:10:47.375,00:10:48.208,He's sleeping?
00:10:51.291,00:10:52.375,Vrum!
00:10:52.458,00:10:55.375,Why do I have a feeling I'm going to be seeing you in court some day?
00:10:56.291,00:10:57.875,-Okay. -How you feeling?
00:11:01.875,00:11:04.500,"Where's my glowing? You know, I was promised glowing."
00:11:04.583,00:11:06.416,-You look great. -I'm fat.
00:11:06.666,00:11:09.416,"But you're the really good kind of fat, you know?"
00:11:09.500,00:11:10.791,Like a little avocado.
00:11:13.458,00:11:16.625,Excuse me while I drop my decaf in slow motion.
00:11:17.041,00:11:18.208,A dating site?
00:11:18.291,00:11:19.333,It's for a case.
00:11:19.416,00:11:21.833,"Wow, you are so taking this case."
00:11:21.916,00:11:23.000,"No, he's the client."
00:11:23.333,00:11:25.166,-A hot client. -Gross client.
00:11:25.250,00:11:26.375,Hot gross client.
00:11:26.458,00:11:33.041,"Obnoxious, gross, hot only to a certain desperate kind of woman who is not me, still perspective client."
00:11:33.125,00:11:33.958,Hmm.
00:11:36.833,00:11:38.291,-Daddy! -Who wants Ben and Jerry's?
00:11:41.250,00:11:43.958,"-Share what? -Nothing! Buddy, come here."
00:11:46.958,00:11:48.666,"Okay, bath time, kiddo. Come on."
00:11:49.041,00:11:50.416,High-five your Auntie Susan good night.
00:11:51.041,00:11:52.291,Nice buddy. Night!
00:11:52.875,00:11:53.875,What did you eat exactly?
00:11:55.000,00:11:57.166,My brother-in-law might be an actual saint.
00:11:58.166,00:12:03.625,Hmm. Saint Gideon did not miraculously fall from the sky like frozen airplane toilet water.
00:12:04.041,00:12:04.875,You know how we met?
00:12:04.958,00:12:06.666,"-Yes, I know, online dating. -Mm-hm."
00:12:07.041,00:12:10.083,Can you believe this guy's been on almost a thousand dates?
00:12:10.500,00:12:13.208,-Are you serious? -He's a classic loophole shark.
00:12:13.541,00:12:16.958,He's exploiting this company over a tiny detail in the fine print.
00:12:17.041,00:12:17.875,Hmm.
00:12:18.291,00:12:20.000,-Interesting case. -Ridiculous case.
00:12:20.083,00:12:22.541,"I mean, my mission is to help the helpless."
00:12:22.625,00:12:24.625,He's not helpless. He's shameless.
00:12:27.833,00:12:31.333,It would mean that my employees could stop job hunting.
00:12:32.000,00:12:34.708,Roberto left his laptop open with his resume there.
00:12:35.208,00:12:36.291,I fixed a typo.
00:12:38.250,00:12:39.333,Of course you did.
00:13:07.000,00:13:07.833,Uh...
00:13:09.583,00:13:10.916,We can start tomorrow.
00:13:36.875,00:13:44.250,The first thing we need to do is take a deep dive into the strange and prolific dating life of Mr. Nicholas Evans.
00:13:44.333,00:13:45.958,Finally a fun case.
00:13:46.041,00:13:48.458,This case is not going to be a walk in the park.
00:13:48.541,00:13:52.416,Love Guaranteed is owned by none other than Tamara Taylor.
00:13:54.875,00:13:55.791,Mm-hm.
00:13:55.875,00:13:57.125,"I'm sorry, Tiffany what now?"
00:13:57.208,00:14:02.541,"Tamara Taylor, the lifestyle guru who tells women to eat nothing but soaked almonds and to steam their..."
00:14:02.625,00:14:03.583,I'm caught up.
00:14:03.666,00:14:07.500,"She is Forbes 500-level loaded, meaning she is going to be lawyered up."
00:14:07.583,00:14:09.208,Our case has to be airtight.
00:14:10.416,00:14:13.708,"You know, I'm looking forward to taking on Love Guaranteed."
00:14:14.000,00:14:16.000,"Hi, Roberto, accounting."
00:14:16.750,00:14:18.250,Are you about to do the big speech?
00:14:18.333,00:14:21.208,"Because if this is the big speech, I have to use the restroom first."
00:14:21.291,00:14:26.083,All those corporate fat cats and their $200 haircuts and their fancy watches.
00:14:26.166,00:14:28.000,They're not even gonna know what hit 'em.
00:14:28.083,00:14:29.125,"I should go, right?"
00:14:30.875,00:14:33.708,"No big speech. Please, use the restroom. Meeting over."
00:14:33.791,00:14:36.708,This is exciting! Standing up for the little guy.
00:14:37.125,00:14:39.541,Online dating can just be so soul crushing.
00:14:39.625,00:14:41.833,"I wouldn't know. Luckily, I've never tried it."
00:14:42.125,00:14:43.166,What?
00:14:43.625,00:14:45.750,"I'm sorry, you've never online dated?"
00:14:45.833,00:14:46.916,"No, what's the big deal?"
00:14:47.000,00:14:50.125,You can't win a case over something you know nothing about.
00:14:50.208,00:14:51.458,We need to get you online.
00:14:51.541,00:14:52.375,-Mm-hm. -No.
00:14:54.291,00:14:55.583,"No, I don't have time for dating."
00:14:55.666,00:14:57.375,It's not dating!
00:14:57.750,00:15:02.708,"What if it's research? You know, it could make the difference between winning or losing this case."
00:15:04.666,00:15:06.625,-Creating your profile. -I thought you had to pee.
00:15:09.208,00:15:11.708,"Okay, fine. But listen, I am proofing it first."
00:15:12.291,00:15:13.291,Don't make me sound weird.
00:15:13.375,00:15:15.208,Don't worry! We got this.
00:15:17.125,00:15:27.708,"Hey just for fun, what photo were you thinking-- -I don't know if men would. -Oh."
00:15:28.541,00:15:33.958,It's both helpful and a little bit creepy that you meticulously documented all of your dates.
00:15:39.375,00:15:41.375,The one who talked about cats all night?
00:15:41.458,00:15:43.166,"Yeah, didn't even own a cat."
00:15:43.916,00:15:46.083,The one who brought her parents on the date?
00:15:46.166,00:15:48.833,"Yeah. She never said a word, but her dad was awesome."
00:15:49.333,00:15:52.625,"I mean, we talked about baseball for hours, it was great."
00:15:52.708,00:15:54.375,I wish I would've got his number.
00:15:54.458,00:15:56.916,The one who needed a date to her sister's wedding.
00:15:57.291,00:16:00.916,"Yeah, two tickets to Hawaii seemed kind of extra for date numero dos."
00:16:02.125,00:16:04.416,The one who got drunk and tried to fight the busboy?
00:16:04.500,00:16:06.416,For the record? I took the punch.
00:16:06.500,00:16:09.666,"Okay, Nick, you cannot name these women like they're episodes of Friends."
00:16:09.750,00:16:12.916,"It's the only way to keep them apart, you know how many Chloes I've dated?"
00:16:13.000,00:16:13.833,Fourteen!
00:16:14.208,00:16:17.333,"Plus 12 Emmas and like, half a dozen Zoes."
00:16:17.416,00:16:20.666,"Okay, little accountability please. You're the one dating in bulk."
00:16:21.375,00:16:23.500,"This lawsuit isn't just about me, you know."
00:16:23.583,00:16:25.916,"Love Guaranteed took advantage of them, too."
00:16:26.000,00:16:27.416,So what are you gonna do if we win?
00:16:27.500,00:16:30.208,You're gonna split the damages with a thousand different women?
00:16:30.291,00:16:31.666,"No, I have plans for that money."
00:16:31.750,00:16:32.583,I bet you do.
00:16:34.250,00:16:37.375,"And just so you know, I was always a perfect gentleman to them."
00:16:37.458,00:16:39.041,I took these women on classy dates.
00:16:39.125,00:16:40.541,Split the check at Denny's?
00:16:40.625,00:16:44.375,"No disrespect to the Grand Slam Breakfast, but give a guy some credit, okay?"
00:16:44.666,00:16:48.500,"Breakfast at Bacco, lunch at Pink Door, and dinner at Coral."
00:16:48.583,00:16:50.250,Coral? That place is fancy.
00:16:50.333,00:16:52.375,Yes. And I paid every time.
00:16:52.833,00:16:54.000,"Alright, I'm impressed."
00:16:54.083,00:16:56.416,More with your time management than anything.
00:16:56.500,00:16:58.791,Yeah? Got most dates down to under an hour.
00:16:58.875,00:17:00.250,Quicker than an oil change.
00:17:00.333,00:17:03.666,"Okay, do you have a heart, or just an empty space where you keep your car keys?"
00:17:04.916,00:17:05.750,"Yeah, it's empty."
00:17:11.583,00:17:13.250,"That was a bad joke, it's 10 a.m."
00:17:13.333,00:17:15.416,"Yeah. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner dates."
00:17:15.916,00:17:16.750,It's breakfast.
00:17:34.291,00:17:37.291,"I know I'm married, but I'd love to see him in my chambers."
00:17:37.375,00:17:38.625,For a debriefing.
00:17:39.083,00:17:40.000,Heyo!
00:17:41.541,00:17:42.750,He's an opportunist.
00:17:42.833,00:17:44.958,We should be ashamed for taking this case.
00:17:51.875,00:17:54.458,"Ooh, I love our new paying client."
00:17:54.541,00:17:55.666,We'll see about that.
00:17:58.250,00:18:04.750,"From Nick's dates. In order for this case to fly, all of them have to be corroborated, so good luck with that."
00:18:10.625,00:18:11.500,What's going on?
00:18:11.958,00:18:13.125,We just went live.
00:18:13.208,00:18:15.708,-What are you talking about? -Your inbox for Love Guaranteed.
00:18:15.791,00:18:17.833,You were supposed to let me proof it first!
00:18:21.541,00:18:24.041,It was the only picture we could find where you weren't working.
00:18:24.125,00:18:27.583,"That's from my birthday at Tortilla Flats, I was wasted."
00:18:34.291,00:18:36.500,I do like old dogs better than puppies.
00:18:36.833,00:18:39.000,"Wait, how do you guys know all this stuff about me?"
00:18:39.083,00:18:41.458,-Lots of overtime. -I went through your garbage.
00:18:41.541,00:18:43.208,They're lighting up like planes on a runway.
00:18:43.625,00:18:44.458,Whoa.
00:18:45.500,00:18:47.375,No. No. Maybe.
00:18:47.458,00:18:49.583,"No, not right now, no."
00:18:49.666,00:18:51.541,I have to interview Nick's dates for their depositions.
00:18:51.625,00:18:55.000,Which you can do while going on dates of your own. #Research.
00:18:55.083,00:18:58.000,Mr. Yang next door is willing to offer you a friends and family lunch discount.
00:18:58.083,00:18:59.083,I do love Yang's.
00:18:59.166,00:19:00.958,He's weirdly as excited as we are.
00:19:02.125,00:19:03.083,For research.
00:19:07.208,00:19:09.708,"Ooh, how about this one in the flannel?"
00:19:10.291,00:19:11.500,Looks like a lumberjack.
00:19:12.000,00:19:14.458,-Like an educated lumberjack. -That's not a thing.
00:19:15.250,00:19:17.583,"-A lumbersexual? -Oh, that's a thing."
00:19:19.916,00:19:25.041,"Uh... hi there. My name's Susan Whitaker, I'm an attorney in the area."
00:19:25.166,00:19:28.958,"I was just wondering, did you ever go on a date with Nicholas Evans?"
00:19:29.583,00:19:33.000,"Yes, I remember him. Because he actually looked like his photo."
00:19:33.750,00:19:35.583,Some dates don't look like their photos?
00:19:55.083,00:19:55.916,Really?
00:19:56.791,00:19:57.875,So how'd the date go?
00:19:58.208,00:20:01.166,-It was the best date I've ever been on. -Mm-hm.
00:20:01.541,00:20:03.166,Wish he would've asked for my number!
00:20:03.250,00:20:07.000,"Nick was the best. Just a nice, normal guy."
00:20:07.083,00:20:08.708,"Like, super normal."
00:20:08.791,00:20:10.833,Some dates are abnormal?
00:20:13.375,00:20:16.166,"So, intermittent fasting, huh?"
00:20:16.750,00:20:17.583,Yeah.
00:20:18.416,00:20:20.333,As in you just purposely don't eat?
00:20:21.000,00:20:24.291,-I'm actually up to 20 hours a day now. -Wow.
00:20:24.875,00:20:25.708,Hmm...
00:20:26.000,00:20:28.416,"isn't that dangerous, or..."
00:20:28.500,00:20:31.166,"No, it's super good for you."
00:20:32.041,00:20:33.166,It's actually how...
00:20:40.833,00:20:45.000,cavemen used to... to eat.
00:20:46.083,00:20:49.208,"Wasn't the life expectancy for a caveman like, 25?"
00:20:53.250,00:20:55.833,"So, tell me about your date with Nick Evans."
00:20:56.375,00:20:59.125,"The date was fine, but I knew he wasn't for me. I got a vibe."
00:20:59.208,00:21:00.875,What kind of a vibe?
00:21:00.958,00:21:03.750,It's like Nick believes he's genuinely looking for love.
00:21:04.041,00:21:06.375,But instead he's trying to prove that love doesn't exist.
00:21:06.458,00:21:07.291,Huh.
00:21:10.291,00:21:12.291,Did you ever find a date to your sister's wedding?
00:21:12.750,00:21:14.416,-It was canceled. -Oh.
00:21:14.500,00:21:17.458,"Turns out the groom's in love with my mom, and not my sister."
00:21:17.541,00:21:18.458,Could you die?
00:21:19.208,00:21:22.208,Wow. Holidays must be interesting at your house.
00:21:22.291,00:21:23.625,At least Nick showed up.
00:21:23.708,00:21:25.791,My last online date totally ghosted me.
00:21:25.875,00:21:27.958,Some dates just don't show up?
00:21:49.291,00:21:52.750,"You guys, I don't know how Nick managed it."
00:21:53.041,00:21:53.875,I don't.
00:21:54.458,00:21:57.875,"I've been on two dates and one no-show, and I am exhausted."
00:21:58.500,00:22:02.208,Why do you think I proposed to Dante after two weeks? It's a jungle out there.
00:22:11.708,00:22:14.625,Are you kidding me? I'm beyond curious to see where this guy works.
00:22:14.708,00:22:16.458,I bet you he's a Crossfit instructor.
00:22:16.541,00:22:19.250,Probably runs an illegal poker game out of a parking garage.
00:22:19.333,00:22:20.750,"Surprise, you're both wrong."
00:22:24.583,00:22:25.458,Hm.
00:22:57.583,00:23:02.375,"Once I'm on my feet, I'm gonna ask Donna over there to go dancing. Hey, Donna."
00:23:02.583,00:23:05.000,You ever been dipped in an Argentine tango?
00:23:06.583,00:23:08.125,"Be careful, she's a maneater."
00:23:08.208,00:23:09.916,"Oh, here's hoping."
00:23:10.166,00:23:11.458,"Jerome, you nasty."
00:23:16.375,00:23:17.833,Wait. What...
00:23:19.166,00:23:20.916,What is happening?
00:23:21.000,00:23:23.291,My crusader for justice.
00:23:24.458,00:23:26.791,"Okay, so many things are finally making sense."
00:23:29.333,00:23:30.750,I didn't know you made house calls.
00:23:30.833,00:23:33.000,I'm just doing my due diligence.
00:23:33.083,00:23:34.458,"Right, checking up on me."
00:23:34.541,00:23:36.958,-Something like that. -Making sure I'm an upstanding citizen.
00:23:40.333,00:23:44.083,"Alright, comedian, I'll see ya Thursday. I'll be with you in two seconds."
00:23:45.083,00:23:47.791,"So, you're how I landed my new client."
00:23:49.541,00:23:51.708,Tossed business your way. Surprised?
00:23:52.208,00:23:53.916,Nick is surprising.
00:23:54.166,00:23:56.833,"Doctor said, my dancing days are over."
00:23:57.208,00:23:58.750,"Nick said, hogwash."
00:23:59.583,00:24:03.708,Nick donates his time here for the old folks like me that can't afford PT.
00:24:04.125,00:24:06.208,He's a good egg. Like you.
00:24:06.291,00:24:07.916,And two good eggs make an omelet.
00:24:13.375,00:24:15.500,Okay. So what do we got?
00:24:16.416,00:24:19.208,Just a few things for you to sign.
00:24:19.500,00:24:20.333,Oh.
00:24:20.416,00:24:22.000,It's just the bottom there.
00:24:22.083,00:24:23.083,"Cool. Oh, guess what?"
00:24:24.666,00:24:26.041,My one thousandth date.
00:24:29.708,00:24:31.333,-Congratulations. -Thank you.
00:24:32.166,00:24:33.000,Hm.
00:24:33.916,00:24:36.666,"So, show me her profile."
00:24:38.916,00:24:41.875,-I don't think that's such a good idea. -Why not?
00:24:42.375,00:24:44.291,"-I don't know, weird. -It's for the case."
00:24:46.541,00:24:48.125,"Sure. Okay, well..."
00:24:49.291,00:24:50.166,Here.
00:24:50.708,00:24:52.000,-Here? Okay. -Press down.
00:24:56.875,00:25:00.166,"she is a fifth grade teacher, she enjoys hiking and gardening."
00:25:00.250,00:25:01.083,Huh.
00:25:01.458,00:25:02.625,She seems adorable.
00:25:02.708,00:25:05.083,Adorable is a number one red flag.
00:25:05.166,00:25:08.416,Anything that sounds too good to be true on the internet is a lie.
00:25:08.500,00:25:09.500,I have noticed that.
00:25:09.583,00:25:10.875,"Yeah, well, wish me luck."
00:25:10.958,00:25:12.375,Hardly seems appropriate.
00:25:14.833,00:25:15.666,Right.
00:25:17.541,00:25:19.166,-'Cause the case. -Right.
00:25:29.000,00:25:33.125,"I don't do sugar, vinegar, dairy, gluten, seeds, or nightshades."
00:25:34.208,00:25:35.041,Ooh!
00:25:35.625,00:25:36.916,No. Mm-hm.
00:25:37.000,00:25:38.666,Get you a drink while you wait?
00:25:38.750,00:25:40.041,"Glass of Pinot, please."
00:25:40.166,00:25:42.083,Does the pecan-crusted tuna have nuts in it?
00:25:42.166,00:25:44.166,It's crusted in pecans.
00:25:45.208,00:25:46.125,Right.
00:25:50.375,00:25:51.875,Oh!
00:26:07.750,00:26:08.583,Damn it.
00:26:14.500,00:26:17.375,"Seriously, could this menu have more shellfish on it?"
00:26:17.708,00:26:21.541,If I even eat one mollusk I'll be covered in eczema like the Elephant Man.
00:26:21.625,00:26:24.375,Did you... hear the one about the greedy clam?
00:26:25.625,00:26:26.958,He was a little shellfish.
00:26:35.583,00:26:36.666,A little shellfish.
00:26:43.541,00:26:44.458,Good evening.
00:26:49.333,00:26:50.166,For how many?
00:26:54.000,00:26:54.833,Shocker.
00:27:02.458,00:27:05.416,"The teriyaki chicken would be nice, if I brought my Epi-pen."
00:27:06.500,00:27:07.500,Which I didn't.
00:27:10.458,00:27:13.375,"Okay, well, look me up on LinkedIn."
00:27:14.625,00:27:15.500,Hm.
00:27:19.583,00:27:22.166,Hey. I know you.
00:27:24.291,00:27:25.166,Susan!
00:27:27.625,00:27:29.375,"No! Oh, God, no."
00:27:37.208,00:27:38.041,Susan!
00:27:38.125,00:27:39.750,"Yes, it's me! Shhh."
00:27:39.833,00:27:42.041,"It's Susan, everybody. We used to date."
00:27:42.791,00:27:43.625,I know.
00:27:47.791,00:27:48.750,purchase you a drink?
00:27:48.833,00:27:51.250,What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be fasting?
00:27:51.333,00:27:52.208,Hm.
00:27:56.916,00:27:58.541,Smells like your drinking window.
00:27:59.250,00:28:01.791,"It's a bit of that, too. You know."
00:28:03.875,00:28:06.916,No!
00:28:11.541,00:28:13.541,You need a sandwich and a nap!
00:28:13.875,00:28:16.166,"Up on three. One, two..."
00:28:16.250,00:28:17.250,Hm.
00:28:21.000,00:28:21.833,Hmm.
00:28:23.875,00:28:26.833,Maybe I'll slide into your DMs later.
00:28:26.916,00:28:28.416,-Gross. -Hmm.
00:28:41.833,00:28:46.125,"I mean, these women, they could be subpoenaed."
00:28:46.208,00:28:50.375,I had to make sure that you weren't intentionally tanking the dates.
00:28:52.250,00:28:53.250,"-Yeah, you were. -No!"
00:28:54.208,00:28:56.208,A little. Professionally.
00:29:01.500,00:29:02.625,It really was. She knows.
00:29:02.708,00:29:03.541,Whoa!
00:29:06.708,00:29:07.791,"Oh, never mind."
00:29:08.208,00:29:09.250,What can I get you?
00:29:09.916,00:29:10.750,"Oh, I'm fine."
00:29:10.833,00:29:12.125,-Thank you. -Please.
00:29:12.458,00:29:13.375,I'm starving.
00:29:14.625,00:29:15.458,Uh...
00:29:15.791,00:29:16.916,One second.
00:29:17.375,00:29:19.791,Yes. Coral burger and fries. Thank you.
00:29:20.333,00:29:21.583,-That's it? -Yeah.
00:29:22.791,00:29:24.000,No special requests?
00:29:24.416,00:29:25.416,Extra mayo.
00:29:26.916,00:29:27.875,I like this one.
00:29:31.000,00:29:33.750,This is where it all happens.
00:29:34.125,00:29:35.625,"Oh, yeah, this is my lucky table."
00:29:37.166,00:29:38.000,"Is it, though?"
00:29:40.416,00:29:42.500,This thing is cursed. Let's go sit somewhere else.
00:29:43.833,00:29:45.958,The only thing I ever wanted to do was play ball.
00:29:47.125,00:29:50.625,"But then I slid into home, tore my ACL."
00:29:52.625,00:29:57.375,"You know, it's funny that your whole life can just change in the blink of an eye."
00:29:58.666,00:30:00.041,"That's terrible, I'm sorry."
00:30:00.750,00:30:03.208,"Only thing that got me through it was my PT, Rasheed."
00:30:06.000,00:30:08.375,"He just really inspired me to do the hard work to heal, you know?"
00:30:08.458,00:30:09.291,Nice.
00:30:09.708,00:30:11.791,And so I decided to become a PT myself.
00:30:12.250,00:30:13.166,Do the same thing.
00:30:19.625,00:30:26.875,What about you? I bet you were Busting rigged hide-and-go-seek games around the neighborhood.
00:30:29.666,00:30:31.958,"No, I suppose you're right. Yeah."
00:30:32.041,00:30:37.666,"I do feel like there's something hardwired in me from birth, to want to just fight for the little guy."
00:30:37.750,00:30:41.458,"One time when I was really little, my parents took me to see The Fugitive."
00:30:42.041,00:30:47.291,And I got so upset that they convicted an innocent man. I'm still upset.
00:30:48.750,00:30:50.833,But I had to go wait in the lobby. Couldn't take it.
00:30:52.416,00:30:53.250,You serious?
00:30:53.333,00:30:56.750,"My dad tried to get me to come back into the theater, but I wouldn't."
00:30:56.916,00:30:59.166,Still haven't seen the end of that movie.
00:31:01.208,00:31:02.291,You never saw the One-Armed Man?
00:31:02.375,00:31:04.291,"If that's a reference to The Fugitive, no."
00:31:05.125,00:31:08.458,"Before the trial is over, we are watching The Fugitive together, okay?"
00:31:08.958,00:31:09.791,It's a date.
00:31:10.875,00:31:12.458,But... also not.
00:31:21.750,00:31:22.791,Actually...
00:31:24.041,00:31:26.541,this is the best dinner I've had in a really long time.
00:31:28.416,00:31:29.333,Same.
00:31:36.166,00:31:37.541,Why don't you tell me about yours?
00:31:38.500,00:31:41.500,-There's nothing much to tell. -I find that hard to believe.
00:31:42.250,00:31:44.583,"Well, I'm running a business."
00:31:45.291,00:31:48.500,It's a lot. I just don't have time for a relationship right now.
00:31:49.791,00:31:52.333,"Someday, you know, I will. Just not today."
00:31:52.541,00:31:53.375,Hmm.
00:31:54.000,00:31:55.125,There had to be someone.
00:31:55.708,00:31:57.708,Of course there was someone.
00:31:58.166,00:32:00.291,"Sure, back in law school. His name was Josh."
00:32:00.375,00:32:04.041,"We thought we were gonna get married, have kids, dogs, whole thing, but..."
00:32:04.958,00:32:06.625,"I don't know, he had other plans."
00:32:08.750,00:32:09.708,What kind of plans?
00:32:15.875,00:32:17.375,"Seriously, how far did you park?"
00:32:17.458,00:32:21.625,"Okay, valet at Coral? Twelve dollars? It's highway robbery."
00:32:21.708,00:32:22.541,Right.
00:32:23.791,00:32:24.666,Hm.
00:32:25.375,00:32:26.333,Oh!
00:32:27.333,00:32:28.375,So this is yours?
00:32:28.541,00:32:30.208,"Yep, this is Zorro."
00:32:30.500,00:32:32.916,"-Nice, Zorro, that's sweet. -Sweet?"
00:32:33.000,00:32:37.416,"No, Zorro is a vigilante who tracks down ruthless villains."
00:32:37.791,00:32:39.875,"-A lot tougher than she looks, huh? -Yeah."
00:32:39.958,00:32:42.041,"-Let me get that for you. -Oh, no, I got it."
00:32:51.333,00:32:52.166,So are you.
00:32:56.583,00:32:59.541,It's my signature end-of-the-date move.
00:33:00.250,00:33:03.208,"It's my way of saying goodbye, good luck, have a nice life."
00:33:04.375,00:33:06.041,So it's an efficient transaction.
00:33:08.791,00:33:14.375,"So, tell me, if you were going to name tonight like an episode of Friends, what would my title be?"
00:33:17.041,00:33:18.541,The one I didn't see coming.
00:33:22.291,00:33:23.166,Night.
00:33:24.333,00:33:25.333,"Night, Susan."
00:33:41.416,00:33:42.416,-Tiffany? -Yeah.
00:33:43.416,00:33:44.375,No idea what that is.
00:33:44.875,00:33:45.708,What?
00:33:47.333,00:33:50.083,"Tiffany, she was like one of the biggest singers in the 1980s."
00:33:50.833,00:33:53.125,"-Oh, Tiffany Tiffany. -Yes, Tiffany."
00:33:53.208,00:33:55.166,"Yeah, still don't know. I have no clue."
00:33:55.250,00:33:59.125,"You must have, it's so-- Are you kidding? I can't tell."
00:34:00.000,00:34:00.833,Possibly.
00:34:01.291,00:34:02.166,"Good night, Nick."
00:34:03.041,00:34:04.041,"Good night, Tiffany."
00:34:18.500,00:34:20.916,"Ms. Kapoor, you can call your own exterminator."
00:34:21.833,00:34:23.083,"Yes, absolutely."
00:34:23.666,00:34:26.583,Tenant law stipulates that you're entitled to a pest-free apartment.
00:34:26.666,00:34:31.416,"Absolute-- Okay. Well let me know how it goes, Ms. K."
00:34:31.500,00:34:32.333,Thank you.
00:34:33.083,00:34:35.833,"Roberto, there is this concept called knocking."
00:34:35.916,00:34:38.333,"-You make a fist, you pull it back-- -Okay, fine."
00:34:44.291,00:34:45.125,Susan Whitaker.
00:34:48.500,00:34:49.333,Mm-hm.
00:34:51.375,00:34:52.208,Uh-huh.
00:34:54.500,00:34:55.666,"Yes, absolutely."
00:34:57.166,00:34:58.333,We look forward to it.
00:35:01.250,00:35:03.916,"That was Bill Jones, lead counsel for Love Guaranteed."
00:35:04.000,00:35:08.666,He invited us to a meeting at their headquarters with none other than Tamara Taylor.
00:35:33.583,00:35:34.750,Keep it close.
00:35:39.416,00:35:41.208,Oh... cozy.
00:35:44.708,00:35:48.208,Hi. Susan Whitaker and Nicholas Evans for Tamara Taylor.
00:35:48.666,00:35:51.125,"Sign in there, please. And fourth floor penthouse."
00:35:52.333,00:35:55.916,"Right, Brad and Veronica met at Love Guaranteed."
00:35:57.166,00:35:59.083,Brad and Veronica are clearly models.
00:36:00.208,00:36:04.500,Just 'cause they're implausibly attractive doesn't mean that they're paid models.
00:36:04.583,00:36:07.166,Don't you have faith in anything good in this world?
00:36:07.708,00:36:10.041,Sure. Just not in Brad and Veronica.
00:36:11.125,00:36:12.750,They fake and they phony.
00:36:18.083,00:36:24.000,"Some ground rules before we go in there: I do the talking. You, no snarking, no snickering, no snorting."
00:36:24.875,00:36:25.750,Snorting?
00:36:26.375,00:36:28.708,"Yes, when you're trying not to laugh you make a sound kind of like..."
00:36:30.458,00:36:32.333,-That sounds nothing like me. -It's exactly like you.
00:36:39.000,00:36:39.916,Ms. Whitaker.
00:36:40.833,00:36:43.375,"-Bill Jones. -My client, Nick Evans."
00:36:46.916,00:36:47.750,Please.
00:36:50.125,00:36:50.958,Right.
00:36:57.833,00:36:58.916,We're ready for her.
00:37:10.500,00:37:13.166,Tashi delek. Jug rog nang. Tibetan greeting. Namaste.
00:37:13.250,00:37:14.833,Have you been offered a drink?
00:37:14.916,00:37:17.541,Filtered stream water? I have it flown in from Chile.
00:37:17.958,00:37:18.958,I'm fine.
00:37:19.458,00:37:21.041,"-We're fine. -Micah, serve them water."
00:37:27.791,00:37:32.375,I was shocked and disappointed to hear that you brought a complaint against Love Guaranteed.
00:37:32.833,00:37:47.583,"Well, per the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, corporations are barred from engaging in misrepresentation, bait-and-switch advertising, and other fraudulent behaviors to promote their products, so... here we are."
00:37:47.666,00:37:50.458,"Ms. Whitaker, have you ever been to Pangong Tso in Tibet?"
00:37:51.333,00:37:52.166,No.
00:37:52.833,00:37:54.916,It is a transformative place.
00:37:55.000,00:38:01.041,"I went on a two-month, barefoot walkabout through the high grasslands, asking myself, What is my purpose on Earth?"
00:38:01.541,00:38:17.458,"One day, a lone bird swooped across the sky and I felt loneliness to the deepest core of my essence and I thought, My website brings much needed hope, love, connection, joy, happiness, life to the masses."
00:38:21.500,00:38:23.750,You're selling a love guarantee.
00:38:24.208,00:38:27.958,Everyone here knows that that language is legally binding.
00:38:28.833,00:38:29.666,So.
00:38:30.000,00:38:33.333,We have a case. You all know it. What are you offering?
00:38:35.250,00:38:36.083,Bill?
00:38:37.666,00:38:42.166,"Well, we have a very generous settlement to offer."
00:38:43.041,00:38:46.583,"One hundred thousand dollars, with a signed non-disclosure agreement."
00:38:46.875,00:38:48.250,We can cut the check today.
00:38:48.333,00:38:53.250,One hundred thousand dollars wouldn't even begin to cover the expenses of my client's dates.
00:38:53.625,00:39:05.208,"We request five hundred thousand in restitution, the promise that your company scrubs all language of a love guarantee from its website and advertising, and I would also obviously need to review any NDA before my client can sign it."
00:39:08.583,00:39:14.875,"We've looked into you, Ms. Whitaker, and we see that your earnest little boutique firm is under water. You're failing."
00:39:15.708,00:39:21.708,"This little do-gooder, crusader for justice attitude, it might impress your clients but it doesn't do anything for me."
00:39:25.250,00:39:28.916,"Luckily, we are not here to talk about me."
00:39:29.000,00:39:31.000,We are here to discuss this case.
00:39:36.041,00:39:38.166,No man can step in the same river twice.
00:39:40.083,00:39:41.625,Do you know why I hired Susan?
00:39:41.708,00:39:44.166,"-Nick, no! -Because she's the opposite of you."
00:39:44.458,00:39:45.291,Okay?
00:39:45.916,00:39:51.375,"She has character and principles, and a sense of common decency."
00:39:53.125,00:39:59.333,"Well, I have a billion dollar empire to run, so just sign the papers and we'll pay you out and this little PR headache will go away."
00:40:08.208,00:40:09.041,No deal.
00:40:10.333,00:40:16.166,"We will see you in court, where we will request one million dollars in punitive damages."
00:40:16.625,00:40:20.541,"Oh, and by the way, it's Heraclitus, not Buddha."
00:40:21.083,00:40:21.916,What?
00:40:22.000,00:40:23.875,The river quote? Yeah.
00:40:24.416,00:40:28.750,"Those inspirational fridge magnets, they have such tiny fine print."
00:40:29.208,00:40:31.083,Really gotta read it carefully.
00:40:33.708,00:40:34.541,Boom.
00:40:36.083,00:40:37.541,The water is gross.
00:40:46.500,00:40:47.416,"Yep, all of them."
00:41:01.250,00:41:08.041,"-What? I mean-- -That was-- Who's idiotic idea was it to guarantee love, anyway?"
00:41:11.125,00:41:11.958,Yours.
00:41:13.000,00:41:14.000,"Micah, you're fired."
00:41:17.333,00:41:21.458,"-That was awesome. -If Tamara Taylor thinks that she can steamroll us, she's got another think coming!"
00:41:24.916,00:41:28.291,"-Another thing coming. -No, it's think, like, think again."
00:41:28.666,00:41:31.083,"Ha! No, it's thing."
00:41:31.458,00:41:34.875,-Do you always have to be right? -Only when the other person's wrong.
00:41:42.000,00:41:44.000,"Hey, thank you."
00:41:44.916,00:41:47.791,For standing up for me in there. That really meant a lot.
00:41:48.708,00:41:51.250,"You stand up for people all day, someone's gotta have your back."
00:41:54.291,00:41:55.166,Oh!
00:41:55.583,00:41:57.875,"You really went in on that song, didn't you?"
00:41:59.041,00:42:02.375,The tape is actually stuck in the player.
00:42:02.458,00:42:04.666,-Right. -Has been since the 80s.
00:42:04.750,00:42:10.041,"-Mm-hm. -The volume knob is also broken, so Zorro decides when it plays and when it doesn't."
00:42:11.458,00:42:13.291,So your car is possessed by Tiffany.
00:42:13.375,00:42:14.833,-Basically. -Great.
00:42:15.666,00:42:18.833,"-Why don't you get it fixed? -Oh, it's on the list."
00:42:19.458,00:42:20.291,Thank you.
00:42:35.166,00:42:36.583,-Who's that? -No clue.
00:42:36.958,00:42:38.958,"The point is, she was amazing."
00:42:39.208,00:42:42.291,"I mean, I've never seen anything like that in my life."
00:42:42.708,00:42:45.916,"She was beautiful, she was poised."
00:42:46.000,00:42:50.750,"You know, for a man who's been on a thousand dates, you got zero game."
00:42:51.708,00:42:53.083,What are you talking about?
00:42:53.583,00:42:54.916,I'm talking about Susan.
00:42:55.208,00:42:57.750,Sus-- No.
00:42:57.833,00:42:58.708,Susan...
00:42:59.541,00:43:02.750,That's my lawyer. She's... no. Off the table.
00:43:02.833,00:43:05.750,"Last I checked, she was a woman first."
00:43:06.041,00:43:09.000,"A smart, beautiful, compassionate woman."
00:43:16.750,00:43:17.958,What's holding you back?
00:43:18.375,00:43:21.833,You just went on a thousand dates and you're afraid to go on one more?
00:43:23.041,00:43:25.250,"Yeah, but Susan's not like the rest."
00:43:25.791,00:43:26.625,Exactly.
00:43:27.750,00:43:28.583,"Scary, isn't it?"
00:43:29.958,00:43:32.708,"You've been playing in the shallow end, where it's safe."
00:43:32.916,00:43:34.791,That ain't where you gonna find love.
00:43:35.083,00:43:37.750,"To find that, you gotta dive deeper."
00:43:40.916,00:43:41.916,What if I sink?
00:43:43.041,00:43:44.083,What if you swim?
00:43:59.458,00:44:01.291,"Charles Gilbert, Seattle Courier."
00:44:01.375,00:44:03.083,How do you plan to take on Love Guaranteed?
00:44:03.166,00:44:05.250,Do you really believe Nick Evans has a case?
00:44:05.541,00:44:09.666,"-How did you hear that I-- -Slow news week, I was trolling courthouse filings, jackpot!"
00:44:09.750,00:44:12.875,"Ex-pro ball player suing a dating site, now that's a human interest piece."
00:44:14.583,00:44:15.625,No comment.
00:44:15.708,00:44:21.000,"Ms. Whitaker, if I could just get a moment-- A reporter just accosted me about Nick's case."
00:44:21.083,00:44:22.666,"I know, isn't it exciting?"
00:44:22.916,00:44:24.708,-What'd you say? -No comment.
00:44:26.708,00:44:31.458,"But listen, we need to focus on getting ready for the trial, not playing this case out in the press."
00:44:31.541,00:44:34.041,-You're no fun. Bill Jones called. -Oh.
00:44:37.041,00:44:38.458,This is only six weeks away.
00:44:38.833,00:44:40.791,"Alright, we can do this. We gotta buckle down."
00:44:40.875,00:44:42.375,I need nights and weekends.
00:44:44.583,00:44:46.958,"And Denise, light that candle you do when the Seahawks are playing."
00:44:47.041,00:44:48.208,Anything for the team.
00:45:20.458,00:45:21.458,"Come on, focus."
00:45:44.750,00:45:45.750,Oh!
00:45:56.333,00:45:57.958,"Oh, where are you going, boss?"
00:45:58.041,00:46:05.041,Love Guaranteed is definitely going to be going after Nick's character and we can't afford for there to be any surprises so I did a little Google stalking.
00:46:05.625,00:46:06.625,Did you find dirt?
00:46:06.708,00:46:09.708,"Not that I want you to. But let's be honest, I love dirt."
00:46:11.625,00:46:15.083,"Nick's not on social media anymore, but I did find some crumbs."
00:46:15.916,00:46:17.375,Her name's Arianna Silver.
00:46:20.541,00:46:23.250,"And we've got to cover our bases, so..."
00:46:23.833,00:46:25.500,I'm gonna go meet with her today.
00:46:28.375,00:46:31.125,"You know, if you're into the whole supermodel thing."
00:46:31.583,00:46:32.833,-Everyone is. -Most people are.
00:46:32.916,00:46:33.916,"Okay, give me the phone."
00:47:33.041,00:47:34.041,Holy crap.
00:47:35.625,00:47:37.666,"Hi, you must be Susan."
00:47:38.333,00:47:39.208,I'm Arianna.
00:47:51.791,00:47:53.166,Nick Evans.
00:47:53.625,00:47:56.458,I haven't heard that name in a minute. How is Nicky?
00:47:56.875,00:47:58.416,Nick is well.
00:47:59.208,00:48:01.916,He is suing a dating website for making false claims.
00:48:02.000,00:48:04.375,"As I told you on the phone, I'm his attorney."
00:48:04.458,00:48:05.500,Sounds like Nick.
00:48:05.833,00:48:07.250,Always calling out a liar.
00:48:08.958,00:48:10.583,Ah! Um...
00:48:11.125,00:48:15.083,"So anyway, I'm looking into his dating history."
00:48:16.375,00:48:19.375,I haven't heard from Nick since the breakup. He took it hard.
00:48:20.541,00:48:21.375,Very hard.
00:48:21.916,00:48:24.333,So you didn't keep in touch?
00:48:27.958,00:48:30.166,My fault. It didn't end well.
00:48:31.500,00:48:32.791,Radio silence ever since.
00:48:39.375,00:48:42.375,Thank you for your time. Your relationship predates my case.
00:48:45.750,00:48:46.625,Wait.
00:48:47.750,00:48:53.666,"If Nick didn't tell you about me, Just some old social media accounts."
00:48:53.750,00:48:55.208,You've been doing some digging.
00:48:56.875,00:48:58.916,"For the case, of course."
00:48:59.000,00:48:59.833,Of course.
00:49:01.208,00:49:02.541,I'll just show myself out.
00:49:06.625,00:49:07.458,Kitchen.
00:49:56.708,00:49:57.541,"Oh, no!"
00:50:06.291,00:50:08.083,There's secret texting codes now?
00:50:09.291,00:50:11.791,"You've been on two, almost three internet dates now."
00:50:14.166,00:50:20.916,"I just wanted to see if you were awake to, you know, go over a couple things."
00:50:21.875,00:50:23.875,"To go over-- Wait, you're still at work?"
00:50:24.541,00:50:25.375,So?
00:50:25.750,00:50:27.750,You are not a normal human being.
00:50:28.166,00:50:29.458,"Fine, what about tomorrow then?"
00:50:31.458,00:50:32.375,What's your point?
00:50:53.666,00:50:57.333,but I am looking forward to meeting this probably fictional person.
00:51:02.583,00:51:05.666,"You know, you're not the cheesy swindler I had you pegged for."
00:51:07.416,00:51:09.833,You're not the uptight lawyer I assumed you were.
00:51:11.583,00:51:13.458,Happy to be wrong for once.
00:51:13.958,00:51:15.333,Wrong? Okay.
00:51:15.625,00:51:18.250,"-Just enjoying that, sorry. -Yeah, well..."
00:51:20.000,00:51:21.666,But you might be a little bit right.
00:51:23.125,00:51:23.958,"Oh, yeah?"
00:51:26.375,00:51:29.791,The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is check my phone.
00:51:30.125,00:51:47.000,"Answer e-mails before I even get out of bed, go to the office all day, then I come home, finish everything I didn't get done at the office, then I get back in bed with my phone, and it starts over again. It's a vicious circle."
00:51:47.500,00:51:48.458,Um...
00:51:49.166,00:51:50.000,Cycle.
00:51:51.416,00:51:52.958,-What? -It's a vicious cycle.
00:51:53.041,00:51:55.416,"-That's the saying. -No, it's vicious circle."
00:51:55.500,00:51:57.833,-Vicious circle? That sounds like a... -Yeah.
00:51:58.416,00:52:00.083,geometry teacher's rock band...
00:52:01.791,00:52:03.500,The Vicious Circle!
00:52:06.916,00:52:08.125,How did you find out?
00:52:12.166,00:52:14.625,That she'd bring him everywhere. Brought him to the date.
00:52:20.375,00:52:23.625,"Wow, you have enough food for a whole week!"
00:52:24.083,00:52:25.041,Exactly.
00:52:25.125,00:52:28.208,"That way, I don't have to think about it until I order again next weekend."
00:52:28.291,00:52:29.333,I like your logic.
00:52:31.000,00:52:32.125,I like your place too.
00:52:33.416,00:52:36.166,Gideon's family actually owns the building.
00:52:36.583,00:52:40.666,He is the most generous brother-in-law and worst landlord on the planet.
00:52:40.750,00:52:44.375,If I didn't raise my own rent I think he'd probably be letting me live here for free.
00:52:46.791,00:52:49.875,Kinda need to talk to you about something.
00:52:53.333,00:52:55.750,I met with Arianna.
00:52:56.250,00:53:00.041,"As soon as I realized your relationship predated our case, I left."
00:53:00.416,00:53:06.750,Okay? But you don't need me running around digging up old wounds from girlfriends past.
00:53:07.458,00:53:08.291,I'm sorry.
00:53:10.708,00:53:12.000,Uh... fiancée.
00:53:15.416,00:53:21.875,"Two months before our wedding, she upped and moved out when I was at work."
00:53:23.000,00:53:25.666,"There was no warning, no letter."
00:53:28.291,00:53:31.833,"Yeah, it turns out she was seeing someone else."
00:53:33.333,00:53:36.250,And had been seeing him for a couple months.
00:53:37.875,00:53:40.458,So... yeah.
00:53:57.625,00:53:59.875,"Mel! Mel, are you okay?"
00:53:59.958,00:54:02.250,-Yeah! My water broke. -Oh!
00:54:04.708,00:54:05.833,"Yeah, that was Gideon."
00:54:06.333,00:54:07.875,We gotta get to the hospital ASAP.
00:54:07.958,00:54:10.541,I have the route all mapped. Where are the car keys?
00:54:11.083,00:54:13.208,-You must be Nick. -Yes.
00:54:13.291,00:54:15.125,-Nice to meet you. -Susan talks about you all the time.
00:54:15.208,00:54:16.958,"-No, I don't. -Yes, you do, actually."
00:54:17.041,00:54:19.541,"-Course she does, I'm her favorite client. -No, that's Jerome."
00:54:19.625,00:54:20.541,Jerome?
00:54:20.625,00:54:22.708,I am ten times more charming than Jerome.
00:54:22.791,00:54:25.541,He's got the whole cute grumpy old man thing going on.
00:54:26.000,00:54:29.208,"That's true. Yeah, he does have the old thing going for him."
00:54:34.666,00:54:36.041,Okay. All right.
00:54:36.125,00:54:39.083,"Gideon, I don't want to give birth in the car!"
00:54:39.166,00:54:40.166,We're leasing.
00:54:46.666,00:54:48.916,"You'd think we hadn't done this birthing thing before, huh?"
00:54:49.000,00:54:50.583,"-You got this. -Okay, sweetie."
00:54:50.666,00:54:52.791,Remember our deal? You be good for Auntie Suze.
00:54:54.583,00:54:59.791,"My contractions are five minutes apart, if we don't leave now, we're naming our baby after the freeway she was born on."
00:55:03.333,00:55:07.291,"Oh, we haven't met yet. Hi, I'm Gideon, nice-- -Nick. -Oh, sorry!"
00:55:07.375,00:55:08.958,-Go! -Here we go.
00:55:11.875,00:55:13.083,Or... don't.
00:55:13.708,00:55:16.583,"-Ooh, it's exciting. -That was... yeah."
00:55:16.791,00:55:19.541,I always thought I'd be at work when D-Day finally came.
00:55:20.333,00:55:22.416,You know I can stick around and help out.
00:55:22.541,00:55:25.250,"Oh, no. You have no idea what you'd be signing up for."
00:55:28.250,00:55:29.125,Piece of cake.
00:55:38.791,00:55:39.625,Ooh!
00:55:40.541,00:55:41.416,Ha!
00:55:41.500,00:55:42.958,Yeah!
00:55:43.083,00:55:47.791,Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!
00:55:47.875,00:55:48.958,Hiyah!
00:55:49.041,00:55:50.000,What happened?
00:55:52.458,00:55:55.375,He was like one of those Von Trapp kids and now it's all Hunger Games.
00:55:58.208,00:55:59.041,Yeah!
00:56:09.166,00:56:12.708,"Oliver, we need to open a window of negotiation about bedtime."
00:56:13.375,00:56:15.041,Are you lawyering a four-year-old?
00:56:15.125,00:56:16.791,I am willing to make concessions.
00:56:19.041,00:56:19.916,Okay.
00:56:20.958,00:56:23.583,What do you want? Just what do you want?
00:56:24.125,00:56:25.666,"Alright, who wants ice cream?"
00:56:27.583,00:56:31.083,"Ice cream coming up, but first lay down, in bed, now."
00:56:31.583,00:56:32.625,Let's go.
00:56:33.875,00:56:34.708,Here.
00:56:36.500,00:56:37.333,Enjoy.
00:56:38.250,00:56:39.208,Voilà.
00:56:39.291,00:56:40.958,"That's all it took, all this time?"
00:56:41.041,00:56:42.916,"Yeah, it's bribery. It's the oldest trick in history."
00:56:44.166,00:56:45.375,"-Night, kid. -Night!"
00:56:52.000,00:56:55.458,"Oh, my goodness. Next time, I'm bringing holy water."
00:57:05.125,00:57:06.833,Baby Amelia is here.
00:57:06.916,00:57:09.541,"Seven pounds, two ounces. Mom and baby are resting."
00:57:09.625,00:57:12.083,-Dad needs alcohol. -Wow!
00:57:14.041,00:57:15.583,"That's incredible, isn't it?"
00:57:16.666,00:57:19.041,How much your life can just change in a moment?
00:57:19.666,00:57:20.500,Yeah.
00:57:27.958,00:57:28.791,I better go.
00:57:29.708,00:57:32.416,"Yeah, I have early PT in the morning."
00:57:32.875,00:57:34.041,-So... -Hm.
00:57:35.333,00:57:36.583,"Special place, isn't it?"
00:57:37.083,00:57:38.125,"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
00:57:38.916,00:57:41.500,"And once we win the case, it's gonna be even better."
00:57:41.916,00:57:42.750,How so?
00:57:43.333,00:57:46.125,Well I'm donating any proceeds from the lawsuit towards a...
00:57:46.500,00:57:47.541,new children's wing.
00:57:48.000,00:57:50.583,You'd be surprised how many little kids we get in there.
00:57:51.166,00:57:52.625,You never told me that.
00:57:53.333,00:57:54.208,You never asked.
00:57:58.708,00:57:59.916,I'm sorry I judged you.
00:58:00.750,00:58:02.750,Don't be. I judged you too.
00:58:03.416,00:58:04.416,Pumpkin spice latte?
00:58:08.291,00:58:09.416,Yeah.
00:58:11.708,00:58:13.083,I had fun tonight.
00:58:13.500,00:58:14.333,"I did, too."
00:58:20.750,00:58:21.666,Right?
00:58:24.458,00:58:25.916,-We can hug. -Right?
00:58:27.083,00:58:28.375,-Yeah. -Mm-hm.
00:58:32.541,00:58:33.958,You don't smell like a lawyer.
00:58:51.333,00:58:52.250,Hm.
00:58:54.750,00:58:55.666,"Good night, Susan."
00:58:57.291,00:58:58.125,Night.
00:59:08.125,00:59:10.333,She's MIA. She's never MIA.
00:59:10.666,00:59:15.375,First she takes yesterday off to spend time with a baby who isn't even a client and now she's late?
00:59:17.791,00:59:19.791,I want to see her name on buses by noon.
00:59:29.750,00:59:31.916,-Is she choking? -I think that was a giggle.
00:59:32.000,00:59:34.250,She sounds like I do after a second Ambien.
00:59:43.541,00:59:45.208,You know? Never better.
00:59:45.875,00:59:47.000,"No, this is fresh."
00:59:47.083,00:59:47.916,Oh!
00:59:48.750,00:59:49.875,You're such a dear.
00:59:51.916,00:59:52.750,Hm.
00:59:53.625,00:59:55.375,"Well, back to the salt mines."
01:00:03.125,01:00:04.958,-I can smell it on you. -Shut up.
01:00:07.125,01:00:08.541,S. Whitaker and Associates.
01:00:09.708,01:00:10.666,"Hold, please."
01:00:18.333,01:00:20.083,"-Oh, hey, you. -Okay."
01:00:20.541,01:00:23.083,What is happening? You have this thing about knocking.
01:00:23.166,01:00:26.041,"Hm. Well, I appreciate your passion for your job."
01:00:26.416,01:00:28.916,"And I appreciate you, Roberto."
01:00:29.750,01:00:30.583,Oh...
01:00:30.958,01:00:31.958,Okay.
01:00:41.750,01:00:45.291,I had to let you know we're calling in a last-minute witness to trial.
01:00:46.458,01:00:47.875,Arianna Silver.
01:00:51.208,01:00:53.958,"You're not the only one digging up dirt, Ms. Whitaker."
01:00:54.375,01:00:56.375,We've been busy little bees.
01:00:57.583,01:01:00.458,Busy looking into Nick Evans' love life.
01:01:02.250,01:01:06.416,And it seems you've been getting awfully cozy with your client.
01:01:06.875,01:01:10.416,"Luckily, my personal life has nothing to do with this case."
01:01:13.958,01:01:22.041,"You see, the love guarantee technically states, subscribers will find love via Love Guaranteed."
01:01:22.583,01:01:26.000,It does not stipulate that the dates have to be arranged on the site.
01:01:26.750,01:01:29.791,Only that the subscribers find love because of it.
01:01:32.916,01:01:33.916,Are you still there?
01:01:39.958,01:01:42.666,This is your last chance to take the settlement.
01:01:42.750,01:01:47.916,"Otherwise this could end, well, badly for both you and your client..."
01:01:49.416,01:01:51.250,Seattle Lady Lawyer.
01:01:53.458,01:01:54.625,Bye.
01:02:49.208,01:02:50.958,"Hey, it's Nick, you free tonight?"
01:02:51.166,01:02:53.791,I just got The Fugitive DVD.
01:02:53.875,01:02:58.250,"Uh, I'm so excited I forgot I haven't owned a DVD player in five years."
01:02:58.333,01:02:59.666,Do you have a DVD player?
01:03:00.208,01:03:01.041,Does anyone?
01:03:21.208,01:03:24.791,That I might've sunk our case by signing up for that ridiculous site?
01:03:29.666,01:03:30.500,Right? So...
01:03:31.458,01:03:33.500,Just pump the brakes while you're working together.
01:03:33.583,01:03:36.041,"That's the problem, I don't want to pump the brakes."
01:03:36.125,01:03:38.333,I've never not wanted to do something more.
01:03:40.791,01:03:41.708,No it's not!
01:03:42.041,01:03:45.208,If Love Guaranteed finds out that Nick is...
01:03:46.083,01:03:49.625,"falling for me, they will use it against us in court."
01:03:49.750,01:03:51.583,We will lose this case.
01:03:51.666,01:03:54.333,"He will not be able to donate any of that money to the center, and..."
01:04:04.541,01:04:05.833,"-Okay. -Love you, sis."
01:04:07.750,01:04:08.583,Hello?
01:04:08.666,01:04:11.208,"Where you been? I left, like, five messages for you."
01:04:13.500,01:04:15.416,Yeah. You want some help?
01:04:15.500,01:04:16.958,"No, I got this."
01:04:19.125,01:04:21.708,"Well, how does a pickup full of Pad Thai sound?"
01:04:22.041,01:04:23.625,You can add the leftovers to your collection.
01:04:23.708,01:04:25.250,"All good over here, thanks."
01:04:26.750,01:04:28.208,You okay? You seem off.
01:04:29.916,01:04:32.250,"You know, we're only two weeks out from our court date."
01:04:38.333,01:04:40.458,"Let me know when you come up for air, then."
01:04:44.833,01:04:47.458,"Nick, I don't think that we should see each other right now."
01:04:47.750,01:04:50.958,"I need to focus on the case, it's my priority."
01:04:51.708,01:04:52.541,Uh...
01:04:54.666,01:04:55.791,Is that what you want?
01:04:57.333,01:05:01.083,We can't always do what we want. Sometimes we need to do what's right.
01:05:03.625,01:05:04.791,Why are you doing this?
01:05:09.125,01:05:11.708,"That's what this whole case is about. It's why you hired me, isn't it?"
01:05:11.791,01:05:12.625,Yeah.
01:05:21.708,01:05:25.083,Cool. I'll see you in court.
01:05:36.541,01:05:37.541,Looks like I sunk.
01:07:06.541,01:07:09.375,Can a dating site guarantee love?
01:07:09.750,01:07:11.083,We're about to find out.
01:07:11.500,01:07:12.916,There she is. Ms. Taylor!
01:07:13.000,01:07:15.000,Blessings.
01:07:15.375,01:07:17.250,Check out my lifestyle blog.
01:07:21.833,01:07:22.666,Hi.
01:07:23.375,01:07:25.125,Is that a new suit? It looks good.
01:07:26.000,01:07:27.333,Let's get this show on the road.
01:07:33.083,01:07:35.291,"Can I have an statement, Mr. Evans?"
01:07:37.041,01:07:39.333,would you pay to find love?
01:07:46.041,01:07:47.875,"Almost anything, right?"
01:07:48.958,01:07:49.791,Well...
01:07:51.000,01:08:01.125,"for 29.95, which includes use of their website and app, Love Guaranteed guarantees that you will find love."
01:08:01.791,01:08:04.125,All you have to do is go on a thousand dates.
01:08:06.000,01:08:09.541,That's right. One thousand different dates.
01:08:10.791,01:08:17.708,"I went on two and a half Love Guaranteed dates, and well, that was quite enough for me, thank you."
01:08:19.541,01:08:24.208,"My client, Nicholas Evans, followed the rules."
01:08:24.291,01:08:27.500,He went on one thousand dates. But...
01:08:28.291,01:08:32.750,Love Guaranteed did not deliver on their promise.
01:08:35.791,01:08:37.625,Nick Evans did not find love.
01:08:41.208,01:08:50.041,"Over the course of this trial, the evidence will prove that Love Guaranteed cares far more about profits than they do the well-being of their subscribers."
01:08:51.083,01:08:57.583,Nicholas Evans asks that you hold Love Guaranteed responsible for their wrongful actions.
01:08:58.375,01:08:59.208,Thank you.
01:09:01.291,01:09:03.500,"Mr. Jones, your turn."
01:09:07.708,01:09:11.416,The defendant stands by Love Guaranteed's brand messaging.
01:09:12.208,01:09:15.833,Love is guaranteed for those truly looking for it.
01:09:16.833,01:09:23.375,"Now, during this trial, the defense will establish that Nick Evans had zero intention of finding love."
01:09:24.833,01:09:29.708,This lawsuit isn't about trade practices or false advertising. No.
01:09:30.625,01:09:35.458,It's a bargain basement gotcha lawsuit all about the money.
01:09:36.125,01:09:44.083,"Now, the evidence will show Nick Evans, having previously been burned by love, had no intention of finding love again."
01:09:44.583,01:09:48.541,"Sure, Mr. Evans may have been on a thousand dates."
01:09:49.083,01:09:54.125,But the evidence will show he was just ticking them off in pursuit of a payday.
01:09:55.083,01:10:03.916,"So, at the conclusion of this trial, the good people of the jury will find for Love Guaranteed and dismiss all charges."
01:10:05.125,01:10:06.041,Thank you.
01:10:10.833,01:10:14.125,"Dr. Rossmore, for the record, what is your field of expertise?"
01:10:15.083,01:10:21.000,"Well I have a PhD in Psychology, and I teach human behavior and the sciences at the university."
01:10:21.750,01:10:24.458,My specialty is attachments and relationships.
01:10:25.000,01:10:27.458,Primarily the science of love.
01:10:28.416,01:10:35.083,"And in your professional opinion, are there any known ways to guarantee love?"
01:10:35.166,01:10:40.166,"All the conclusions agree there is no way to predict love, much less guarantee it."
01:10:43.500,01:10:44.666,Why didn't you object?
01:10:45.000,01:10:48.166,"The doctor is an expert witness, there was nothing to object to."
01:10:49.666,01:10:52.125,-Why do you keep hitting me? -Because you like it.
01:10:55.541,01:10:56.375,"No, I don't."
01:10:56.958,01:10:58.666,And how did the date go?
01:10:59.125,01:11:00.750,Nick asked all about me.
01:11:01.208,01:11:03.916,First time that's ever happened on an internet date.
01:11:04.000,01:11:05.041,"Am I right, ladies?"
01:11:08.875,01:11:13.833,Did you ever feel like Nick was just going through the motions?
01:11:21.500,01:11:24.041,"-Uh... No, he was really nice. -Thank you."
01:11:26.458,01:11:28.166,And how did you leave it?
01:11:28.833,01:11:34.291,"Nick insisted on paying the bill, walked me to my car, shook my hand good night. The perfect gentleman."
01:11:35.166,01:11:36.666,Thank you for your time today.
01:11:37.208,01:11:38.291,Defendant's witness.
01:11:39.500,01:11:40.333,Come on.
01:11:41.333,01:11:47.916,You expect us to believe Mr. Out For A Quick Buck didn't intentionally throw the date?
01:11:48.000,01:11:49.916,"No, like I said. Perfect gentleman."
01:11:50.416,01:11:53.333,Uh-huh. Then why didn't you go out again?
01:11:53.916,01:11:57.250,It's internet dating. Click and move on. That's how it goes.
01:11:57.333,01:12:05.000,"No, how it goes is Nick Evans had zero intention of finding love, -and he manufactured-- -Objection, Your Honor."
01:12:09.708,01:12:12.083,Nick and I went on one date.
01:12:12.500,01:12:14.708,It's impossible to say what was in his heart.
01:12:15.250,01:12:18.666,But I hope he does find love one day. He deserves it.
01:12:19.583,01:12:20.458,We all do.
01:12:24.833,01:12:25.666,Ugh.
01:12:27.916,01:12:29.500,No further questions.
01:12:30.416,01:12:32.916,"He's coming off like a saint in there, what is your plan?"
01:12:33.000,01:12:34.416,-Don't worry. -Don't touch me!
01:12:34.500,01:12:35.375,Okay.
01:12:35.458,01:12:40.708,"Tomorrow, we're going to tear apart Nick's character and motivation by delving into his relationships."
01:12:40.958,01:12:43.500,Both past and present.
01:12:49.583,01:12:52.416,"Ms. Taylor, can I get a statement for Rise and Shine Seattle?"
01:12:52.500,01:12:53.541,"Yeah, it's a silly lawsuit."
01:12:53.625,01:12:55.958,We are still the best dating website you can subscribe to.
01:12:56.041,01:12:58.041,Check out my lifestyle blog for today's tips.
01:12:58.125,01:13:00.166,"No gluten, no dairy, no wheat, no sugar, no..."
01:13:00.250,01:13:03.916,"Kicking ass, taking names, and looking fierce the entire time."
01:13:04.000,01:13:05.333,"Check, check, check."
01:13:07.708,01:13:10.291,I just can't let Bill Jones ruin Nick's reputation.
01:13:10.916,01:13:11.750,Hm.
01:13:12.458,01:13:13.291,Hold on.
01:13:14.708,01:13:16.458,-Hold on? -To what?
01:13:22.750,01:13:23.583,Hi.
01:13:24.750,01:13:25.791,"Listen, I..."
01:13:26.666,01:13:29.541,"I have an idea. It's a little unorthodox, but..."
01:13:30.625,01:13:33.125,I'd like to call Arianna to the stand tomorrow.
01:13:33.500,01:13:34.333,Why?
01:13:37.416,01:13:40.916,It's better that we manage her testimony rather than react to it.
01:13:43.916,01:13:46.458,So we take the wind out of Love Guaranteed's sails.
01:13:50.875,01:13:54.208,But it will show the court that you're not taking this lying down.
01:13:56.958,01:13:59.958,"You're an honorable guy, Nick, and that's gonna come through."
01:14:00.791,01:14:01.625,Thank you.
01:14:06.291,01:14:07.208,Susan...
01:14:11.375,01:14:12.500,I'll see you tomorrow.
01:14:51.416,01:14:54.666,"I hate you, Tiffany!"
01:15:08.166,01:15:11.000,the plaintiff would like to call Ms. Arianna Silver.
01:15:14.750,01:15:16.083,"Come to the bench, please."
01:15:17.750,01:15:20.666,You can't do this. Arianna Silver is a witness for the defense.
01:15:23.333,01:15:25.250,She's trying to steal my witness.
01:15:25.333,01:15:26.583,"All right, listen up."
01:15:27.083,01:15:35.125,"If Ms. Whitaker somehow thinks the defense’s witness will help her case, then she has the right to call whoever she wants."
01:15:35.583,01:15:40.791,"And as she pointed out, Mr. Jones, you will have your chance during cross."
01:15:41.500,01:15:43.833,"So yes, I'm going to allow it."
01:15:45.166,01:15:46.000,Back you go.
01:15:50.166,01:15:51.625,"Thank you, Your Honor."
01:15:52.375,01:15:55.375,The plaintiff calls Ms. Arianna Silver to the stand.
01:16:17.583,01:16:20.208,"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?"
01:16:20.291,01:16:21.125,I do.
01:16:28.333,01:16:32.375,"Ms. Silver, how did you know Mr. Evans?"
01:16:33.541,01:16:34.708,He's my ex-fiance.
01:16:37.333,01:16:40.875,And for the question on everyone's mind.
01:16:40.958,01:16:41.958,What happened?
01:16:43.041,01:16:43.875,I left him.
01:16:44.750,01:16:45.625,For someone else.
01:16:46.958,01:16:49.250,I'm getting married next month.
01:16:51.708,01:17:03.208,"To put it plainly, Ms. Silver, It is my presumption that the defense named you as a witness in hopes to reflect negatively on Mr. Evans' character."
01:17:04.458,01:17:13.208,"When I spoke to Mr. Jones, about being a witness, I did mention that I thought Nick was licking his wounds."
01:17:13.750,01:17:16.958,"I mean, a thousand dates and you couldn't find someone new?"
01:17:22.000,01:17:25.833,And do you still feel the same way?
01:17:33.000,01:17:34.250,"Actually, no."
01:17:37.708,01:17:38.750,Nick is a great guy.
01:17:39.666,01:17:41.375,He's all about being honest.
01:17:41.916,01:17:45.083,So I assume that this lawsuit is on the up and up.
01:17:48.541,01:17:49.791,I only wish him well.
01:17:53.375,01:17:54.375,Defendant's witness.
01:17:56.666,01:17:57.500,No questions.
01:17:59.916,01:18:01.875,then the witness can be excused.
01:18:02.416,01:18:07.291,And we'll take a 15-minute recess before the plaintiff takes the stand.
01:18:16.333,01:18:19.583,I just want to thank you.
01:18:21.416,01:18:23.166,I'm sorry how things ended with us.
01:18:24.875,01:18:25.750,It's my fault.
01:18:29.458,01:18:30.666,but I did learn from it.
01:18:31.583,01:18:33.208,I'm with the right person now.
01:18:33.708,01:18:34.625,I'm happy for you.
01:18:35.291,01:18:36.333,Mm-hm.
01:18:37.083,01:18:38.250,I'm happy for you too.
01:18:42.583,01:18:44.083,You're in love with your lawyer.
01:18:45.291,01:18:46.125,Hmm...
01:18:46.750,01:18:50.041,"I just hope you can admit it to yourself, before it's too late."
01:18:54.458,01:18:56.208,But what if she doesn't feel the same way?
01:18:58.708,01:18:59.958,What if I get hurt again?
01:19:01.291,01:19:03.250,"There are no guarantees in love, Nick."
01:19:04.125,01:19:05.875,Isn't that what this is all about?
01:19:13.750,01:19:14.666,I do.
01:19:25.291,01:19:36.750,"in your own words, please, tell the court how Love Guaranteed deceived and damaged you with their false promises."
01:20:00.916,01:20:06.541,"When I started this whole thing, I was out for justice."
01:20:08.583,01:20:11.833,Love isn't something you can just guarantee.
01:20:13.083,01:20:14.333,Like a pizza delivery.
01:20:17.291,01:20:18.458,Love is unpredictable.
01:20:20.083,01:20:21.083,And it can burn you.
01:20:24.000,01:20:27.958,But it can also surprise you in the most remarkable ways.
01:20:31.375,01:20:37.041,"It turns out I did find love, when I fell in love with my lawyer."
01:20:42.625,01:20:45.791,Ms. Whitaker herself said she subscribed to Love Guaranteed.
01:20:46.500,01:20:50.125,"If Nick Evans is in love with her, this lawsuit has to be dismissed."
01:20:50.541,01:20:53.166,"Folks, we must have order in the courtroom."
01:20:54.375,01:20:56.958,"There's no need for dismissal, Your Honor."
01:20:58.291,01:20:59.541,I'm dropping the lawsuit.
01:21:03.291,01:21:04.416,Mr. Jones is right.
01:21:05.250,01:21:09.916,"While I didn't meet Susan through the site, I met her because of it."
01:21:11.500,01:21:14.166,"And I promised to tell the truth under oath, so..."
01:21:17.791,01:21:22.500,I'd much rather have love in my life than win here in court today.
01:21:24.541,01:21:28.125,It's an amazing thing when you find someone who gets you.
01:21:29.166,01:21:30.583,And you get them in return.
01:21:32.666,01:21:34.583,Even when they're right and you're wrong.
01:21:36.458,01:21:39.375,"Turns out the saying is, You've got another think coming."
01:21:46.333,01:21:48.791,"A wise old man once told me to dive in, so..."
01:21:51.541,01:21:52.375,here it goes.
01:21:55.291,01:22:00.958,"What I realized, that I don't want a guarantee."
01:22:02.000,01:22:03.208,Or a safety net.
01:22:05.208,01:22:06.208,All I want...
01:22:09.125,01:22:10.583,is to take a chance with you.
01:22:12.833,01:22:14.125,It's not a risk to fall in love.
01:22:17.416,01:22:18.375,It's a risk not to.
01:22:28.041,01:22:29.125,"I love you, Susan."
01:22:30.833,01:22:31.833,Do you love me too?
01:22:35.250,01:22:37.750,"Ms. Whitaker, answer that question."
01:22:40.500,01:22:41.416,I do!
01:22:58.250,01:23:00.541,"I give you all the credit, I do."
01:23:01.250,01:23:02.791,-You take care of her. -I will.
01:23:02.875,01:23:04.583,-I'm so proud of you. -My man!
01:23:04.666,01:23:06.416,-You smell like wine. -A little bit.
01:23:11.375,01:23:13.875,Ms. Taylor would like a word with you. Please.
01:23:19.750,01:23:20.791,Hmm.
01:23:23.875,01:23:30.125,"When I studied with my Lama in Tibet, he said, The thousand brilliant accomplishments of the past do not serve today's purpose."
01:23:30.958,01:23:31.791,Hmm.
01:23:34.416,01:23:40.375,"and I'll donate 250 thousand to your hospital, if you two become the new face of Love Guaranteed."
01:23:42.666,01:23:47.708,-Why would you do that? -An old-fashioned love story complete with a romantic courtroom confession?
01:23:48.041,01:23:49.166,People love that crap.
01:23:49.250,01:23:50.500,I mean...
01:23:50.583,01:23:53.541,It's gonna make me look so good on social media. It's not hard...
01:23:53.625,01:23:55.958,It's much better than the fake poster couple we have now.
01:23:56.041,01:23:57.083,I knew it!
01:23:57.500,01:23:58.750,Brad and Veronica.
01:23:58.875,01:24:01.166,"-He did, he called that. Hm-- -I called that."
01:24:01.875,01:24:07.625,"Two hundred and fifty thousand for the hospital. That's a lot, but we were seeking a million in damages."
01:24:07.708,01:24:10.000,"And let's face it, we could've had it, so..."
01:24:10.083,01:24:11.208,But you didn't.
01:24:11.291,01:24:14.333,-We could've though. -How about 500 thousand?
01:24:19.541,01:24:20.375,Deal.
01:24:23.416,01:24:27.875,The jury still out on whether a dating site can guarantee love.
01:24:28.333,01:24:31.541,But love guarantees a happy ending.
01:24:34.625,01:24:37.250,So what do we do now? Go on an official first date?
01:24:38.250,01:24:39.791,Anything but a first date.
