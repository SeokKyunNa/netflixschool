00:00:20.500,00:00:21.916,It's safe here.
00:00:23.833,00:00:25.208,How many of you are there?
00:00:26.708,00:00:28.625,Are any of them children?
00:00:30.208,00:00:35.625,"Because the fastest way to get here is by the river, and I don't think you could make it with kids."
00:00:49.500,00:00:52.375,We are going on the trip now. It's going to be rough.
00:00:52.458,00:00:57.041,"It's gonna feel like it's going on for a long time, so it's gonna be hard to stay alert."
00:00:57.125,00:01:01.083,"It's gonna be even harder to be quiet, but you have to do both."
00:01:01.166,00:01:05.958,You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
00:01:06.041,00:01:07.166,Understand?
00:01:09.041,00:01:13.625,Under no circumstance are you allowed to take off your blindfold.
00:01:13.708,00:01:16.333,"If I find that you have, I will hurt you."
00:01:16.416,00:01:17.958,Do you understand?
00:01:20.041,00:01:22.166,It's cold. We have blankets.
00:01:22.250,00:01:24.708,"Boy, you have your dog. Girl, you have your kitty."
00:01:24.791,00:01:28.625,This is just a place. There's nothing more that we need from it.
00:01:28.708,00:01:30.500,Do you understand?
00:01:32.583,00:01:35.791,And no talking on the river.
00:01:37.125,00:01:39.708,You must listen as closely as you can.
00:01:39.791,00:01:42.541,"If you hear something in the woods, you tell me."
00:01:42.625,00:01:45.250,"If you hear something in the water, you tell me."
00:01:45.333,00:01:48.708,"But you never, ever take off your blindfold."
00:01:48.791,00:01:51.000,"If you look, you will die."
00:01:51.291,00:01:52.541,Do you understand?
00:02:14.000,00:02:14.833,Let's go.
00:02:31.541,00:02:35.833,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
00:02:52.625,00:02:54.250,"Thirty-one, 32, 33."
00:02:54.333,00:02:55.708,Where is it? Where is it?
00:04:07.708,00:04:11.625,"-Uh... asshole, I was listening to that. -Yeah, so were the people down the street."
00:04:11.708,00:04:14.541,The store was packed. This thing seems serious.
00:04:14.625,00:04:16.625,"Wow, you literally have no food."
00:04:16.708,00:04:18.708,-What-- What thing? -Are you serious?
00:04:18.791,00:04:20.583,"-I'm serious. -Turn on the news, dumb-dumb."
00:04:22.500,00:04:24.791,"-What channel, dumb-dumb? -Any one of them."
00:04:27.541,00:04:35.125,Streets are crowded with people escaping cities by car and on foot as witnesses report unexplained mass suicides.
00:04:35.208,00:04:40.541,"First recorded in Romania, there's now an alarming spread of incidents into Europe and Siberia."
00:04:40.625,00:04:43.750,Estimated death toll is in the tens of thousands.
00:04:43.833,00:04:47.625,...don't yet know what is causing the mass suicides in Europe and Russia.
00:04:47.708,00:04:51.291,The eyewitness reports tell of people exhibiting psychotic behavior.
00:04:51.375,00:04:55.583,Our sources are telling us this does not appear to be pathological or viral.
00:04:55.666,00:04:58.375,US authorities are advising the public to remain calm.
00:04:59.000,00:05:02.708,"There have been no officially confirmed inst-- Well, it's in Russia, so..."
00:05:03.375,00:05:06.708,"Well, try telling that to the soccer moms fighting over bottled water."
00:05:06.791,00:05:10.208,"Speaking of which, I just got off the phone with Mom."
00:05:10.291,00:05:12.625,How come I have to update her about you all the time?
00:05:12.708,00:05:15.375,-Why do you have to talk about me? -I'm not telling her about my life.
00:05:16.958,00:05:20.041,"At three o'clock, I'm gonna go check out an Arabian stud in Sausalito."
00:05:20.125,00:05:22.291,"See, now that is a sentence you don't hear every day."
00:05:22.375,00:05:26.250,-You wanna come? -I can't. I've got my OB with Dr. Lapham.
00:05:26.333,00:05:27.791,"-Lapham, when? -Oh, my God."
00:05:27.875,00:05:29.791,Why does your voice get high when it gets excited?
00:05:29.875,00:05:31.416,"-How about I drive you? -No, I'm fine."
00:05:31.500,00:05:33.666,I can go in. We can maybe see the baby.
00:05:33.750,00:05:36.333,Or I can cancel the appointment and we can go and see a horse.
00:05:36.416,00:05:38.125,No. Fuck the horse.
00:05:38.208,00:05:40.166,Wow. Such venom.
00:05:42.125,00:05:43.500,What do you think?
00:05:45.458,00:05:51.125,"I think I see a whole bunch of people sitting together, but they all feel incredibly lonely."
00:05:51.208,00:05:52.833,The loneliness is just incidental.
00:05:53.416,00:05:55.958,It's really about people's inability to connect.
00:05:59.125,00:06:00.583,Inability to connect to what?
00:06:00.666,00:06:01.875,-Can you move? -Malorie.
00:06:01.958,00:06:03.625,-I need you to move. -We've been through this.
00:06:03.708,00:06:05.916,-Mm-hmm. -That's not how it's gonna be for you.
00:06:07.000,00:06:09.708,It's different with a baby. It's an immediate love affair.
00:06:09.791,00:06:11.708,"-It's not gonna be that way for me. -Yes, it will."
00:06:11.791,00:06:15.208,"-No, ma'am. -You should be afraid of being alone, not of this."
00:06:20.083,00:06:24.500,"...out into the real world with other people, not stuck in this house all day. You never leave."
00:06:24.583,00:06:26.875,Why should I leave? I have you to get me groceries.
00:06:26.958,00:06:28.291,"-You have to move. -No, not moving."
00:06:28.375,00:06:29.541,"-Yes, you do. -Not moving."
00:06:29.625,00:06:31.250,-Why? -Not moving. I love my house!
00:06:31.333,00:06:36.291,"I know it took you a long time to find a studio you loved, and ever since Ryan left, you've gotten a lot more work done."
00:06:36.375,00:06:38.875,"But, so fine, so no more roommates."
00:06:38.958,00:06:40.041,Ryan was not a roommate.
00:06:40.125,00:06:41.833,"Uh, it turns out he kind of was."
00:06:44.833,00:06:48.541,"Anyway, can't raise a kid here. Where would you even put her?"
00:06:49.666,00:06:51.125,How do you know it's a she?
00:06:52.291,00:06:53.916,"Wishful thinking, I guess."
00:07:02.916,00:07:03.833,Hi.
00:07:11.125,00:07:12.000,Yeah.
00:07:12.083,00:07:13.750,I'll call right back.
00:07:13.833,00:07:14.708,What?
00:07:15.708,00:07:17.458,You still don't wanna know the gender?
00:07:17.541,00:07:20.166,"And ruin the surprise, Dr. Lapham? No."
00:07:25.916,00:07:28.666,I never slept well before I had this condition.
00:07:28.750,00:07:31.125,It's called pregnancy. It's okay to say it out loud.
00:07:31.208,00:07:34.833,"Oh, don't you know, Doctor, if you don't acknowledge a thing, it simply goes away?"
00:07:34.916,00:07:37.166,"Oh, really? All this time, I had no idea."
00:07:39.125,00:07:42.958,"You know about horses? When a horse gets pregnant, it knows right away."
00:07:43.041,00:07:43.916,Does it?
00:07:44.000,00:07:46.208,It changes the way it eats. It changes its gait.
00:07:46.291,00:07:49.041,It bites all the other horses who come too close.
00:07:49.125,00:07:50.500,It's too bad we're not horses.
00:07:50.583,00:07:58.416,"It is too bad. Great to be a horse. Then we would have, like, a mother who would have actually raised us and a father off on some faraway stud farm."
00:07:58.500,00:08:00.916,Hold on. Our father was off on a faraway stud farm.
00:08:04.583,00:08:05.750,Poor us.
00:08:05.833,00:08:09.375,We should go feel sorry for ourselves with lunch and a bottle of wine.
00:08:09.458,00:08:11.583,"Oh, finally, now you're making some sense."
00:08:11.666,00:08:13.750,"-Good. -Really, in front of me?"
00:08:13.833,00:08:14.833,We didn't mean it...
00:08:14.916,00:08:17.791,"No, like a tiny glass of ros√© is not gonna hurt the little bean."
00:08:17.875,00:08:19.541,I'm pretty sure I heard the word bottle.
00:08:19.625,00:08:24.125,You might want to think of a name besides little bean seeing as your child is now the size of a small melon.
00:08:26.166,00:08:29.000,I know it's hard to love someone you haven't met yet.
00:08:29.583,00:08:31.041,"Oh, that's beautiful."
00:08:32.083,00:08:35.458,"Thought about stitching that on, like, a little lavender sachet?"
00:08:36.041,00:08:38.125,-Could sell them in the gift shop. -In the gift shop.
00:08:38.208,00:08:39.583,"You're having a baby, Malorie."
00:08:40.166,00:08:46.875,"Pretty soon you and I, Jessica, and some hard-ass labor and delivery nurse will be on the third floor making the same wise cracks."
00:08:46.958,00:08:49.583,"Only this time, you won't be going home by yourself."
00:08:50.708,00:08:52.375,I know. I know.
00:08:56.708,00:08:59.500,there are plenty of couples who are desperate to adopt a child.
00:09:00.000,00:09:02.750,There are no judgments here. You can make whatever choice you want.
00:09:02.833,00:09:06.666,But what you can't do is ignore it and hope it just goes away.
00:09:24.208,00:09:25.083,Are you puking?
00:09:26.833,00:09:27.833,Just go to the car.
00:09:27.916,00:09:29.125,Is it chunky?
00:09:29.208,00:09:33.250,"No, it was actually the really smooth kind that just shoots out real clean."
00:09:33.333,00:09:35.125,"I'll meet you at the car, okay?"
00:09:58.583,00:10:00.041,Watch out. Help. I need help!
00:10:02.375,00:10:03.500,"No, get back!"
00:10:03.583,00:10:06.333,-Calm down. Please calm down. -Code gray. Level one.
00:10:06.416,00:10:08.250,Calm down. Security!
00:10:20.833,00:10:21.708,You get any on you?
00:10:21.791,00:10:24.375,"The thing in Russia that's making everybody crazy, it's here now."
00:10:24.458,00:10:31.125,"-What? -Can you just, please-- Go, go, go, go!"
00:10:38.375,00:10:39.666,"Go, go, go, go, go!"
00:10:45.875,00:10:47.333,We're going straight to Santa Rosa.
00:10:47.416,00:10:49.958,You can stay at my place until whatever the fuck this is isn't.
00:10:50.041,00:10:52.333,-I don't have any clothes. -You can wear something of mine.
00:10:52.416,00:10:54.333,I'm not much of a chaps-and-boots gal.
00:10:54.416,00:10:56.291,You're worried about what to wear right now?
00:10:56.375,00:10:58.583,"Well, I find it comforting to focus on the wrong things."
00:11:01.166,00:11:03.333,There's a car stopped in the middle of the fucking road.
00:11:03.416,00:11:04.291,Stop. Just go round.
00:11:05.458,00:11:18.708,"If this thing gets any worse, you'll wanna be off the roads People have to stop being so stupid."
00:11:20.625,00:11:22.375,"Oh, my God, Jess. Just go. Go."
00:11:22.458,00:11:24.291,I'm not running the light with a pregnant lady in the car.
00:11:24.375,00:11:25.625,Just drive the car!
00:11:25.708,00:11:27.750,You gotta let me just drive. You're freaking me out.
00:11:34.625,00:11:37.250,-This isn't me. -My phone is in the back seat.
00:11:37.333,00:11:40.125,"-It's the foreman wondering where I am. -Right, just hold your horses."
00:11:48.416,00:11:49.583,What the fuck is what?
00:11:50.875,00:11:52.708,What the fuck is what? What are you looking at?
00:11:52.791,00:11:55.041,What did you see? Talk to me. What the fuck is what?
00:11:55.125,00:11:57.541,"What are you doing? Oh, my God, Jess. Jess, don't do that."
00:11:57.625,00:12:01.416,Just what are you-- What is wrong with you? No. Stop it! Stop it!
00:12:01.500,00:12:03.000,"No, no, no!"
00:12:03.083,00:12:04.083,Stop it! Stop it!
00:12:04.166,00:12:07.833,"Jess, what the fuck is wrong with you? Jess, please. Stop it, Jess."
00:12:07.916,00:12:10.166,God damn it! Stop it! Please stop it!
00:13:27.833,00:13:29.500,"-Lydia, what are you doing? -She's pregnant."
00:13:29.583,00:13:31.750,"Lydia, not now. Let's go in."
00:13:31.833,00:13:33.083,She's pregnant.
00:13:33.166,00:13:34.208,You can't help!
00:13:36.458,00:13:38.333,"Hurry, come inside!"
00:13:38.416,00:13:39.333,Okay.
00:13:42.958,00:13:44.666,"Sweetheart, get up. Right now."
00:13:46.333,00:13:47.291,Mom.
00:13:48.291,00:13:49.208,Please don't go.
00:13:51.125,00:13:52.000,Please don't go.
00:14:05.333,00:14:06.833,Keep your eyes down.
00:14:31.333,00:14:33.291,-Open the door! -No.
00:14:41.208,00:14:42.583,Get in. Hurry!
00:14:42.666,00:14:44.666,Come on. You good?
00:14:46.708,00:14:47.750,Are you okay?
00:14:55.000,00:14:56.416,She went to help you.
00:14:58.666,00:14:59.833,Now she's gone.
00:15:15.708,00:15:18.541,Is anyone getting service in here? You don't have any Wi-Fi?
00:15:33.875,00:15:36.958,"Mom? Mom, call me. Call me right now."
00:15:42.500,00:15:46.208,That thing fucks with your nervous system. I've seen it in my clients for weeks.
00:15:46.291,00:15:48.333,"Hey, did I mention I'm a fucking cop?"
00:15:50.125,00:15:51.958,You're in the Academy. Doesn't make you a cop.
00:15:52.041,00:15:55.666,"Whatever it is, I'm sure they'll send someone soon."
00:15:55.750,00:15:59.666,"No, the only thing that will happen soon is we're all gonna die soon."
00:16:00.250,00:16:03.750,This has a classic bio-warfare signature.
00:16:03.833,00:16:05.583,North Korea or Iran.
00:16:08.625,00:16:10.666,We just all gotta try to stay calm.
00:16:15.666,00:16:17.166,We are so fucking fucked.
00:16:19.833,00:16:24.291,"We were running up the street, and I swear to God, I-- I felt something."
00:16:31.791,00:16:33.000,So fucking fucked.
00:16:45.500,00:16:46.375,-What? -What?
00:16:46.458,00:16:49.000,"One minute, we were digging a foundation..."
00:16:49.666,00:16:52.541,and then my contractor just lies down in front of the bulldozer.
00:16:52.625,00:16:56.500,And then my operator tips the rig into the ditch and snaps his own neck.
00:16:59.833,00:17:03.458,it makes you crazy or it makes you wanna hurt yourself.
00:17:04.041,00:17:06.083,"No, it makes you kill yourself."
00:17:12.625,00:17:15.375,Close the windows. Get the windows! Close all the windows.
00:17:28.958,00:17:30.291,"Oh, thank you, Jesus."
00:17:30.375,00:17:31.833,"Andy, Bailey, can you hear me?"
00:17:34.791,00:17:36.625,-Bailey! Bailey? -Bailey.
00:17:39.791,00:17:42.250,"-If you go outside, you'll die. -My children are out there!"
00:17:48.083,00:17:50.375,a state of emergency and has closed all borders.
00:17:51.208,00:17:53.541,"Do not, do not go outside."
00:17:58.166,00:18:00.500,What? What in the shit is happening?
00:18:03.791,00:18:07.250,"The end game. Humanity has been judged, and we've been found wanting."
00:18:10.958,00:18:19.875,You got world religion and mythology that's full of mentions of demons or spirit creatures. People who've seen these creatures almost always describe their encounter as this...
00:18:19.958,00:18:23.208,as with an entity that takes on a form of your worst fears or...
00:18:23.833,00:18:25.833,your deepest sadness or your greatest loss.
00:18:25.916,00:18:27.833,Sounds like bullshit to me. Religious talk.
00:18:27.916,00:18:31.125,"It's not bullshit, okay? It's real talk. It's facts."
00:18:31.208,00:18:32.791,They come in all different forms.
00:18:32.875,00:18:37.833,"You got the Aka Manah, the Varios Daevas from ancient Zoroastrian legend."
00:18:37.916,00:18:46.708,You've got the Surgat from ancient Christian occult beliefs that made pregnant women encounter their unborn children as other creatures such as lobsters or spiders.
00:18:46.791,00:18:51.291,You've got the Huli-jing from China. You've got the Puca from Celtic mythology.
00:18:51.375,00:18:54.583,"All different names, but the same thing."
00:18:54.666,00:18:55.666,And what's that?
00:18:57.625,00:18:58.750,The end of us.
00:18:59.541,00:19:02.625,"Charlie, did you learn all of that working at the supermarket?"
00:19:03.791,00:19:06.916,"-No, I've been studying it for years. -In college?"
00:19:07.000,00:19:09.375,"Not college per se, but..."
00:19:09.458,00:19:12.333,I mean the Internet. That's where you get all your information from.
00:19:12.416,00:19:15.208,"-I'm working on a novel, guys. -Fuck's sake."
00:19:21.250,00:19:23.041,We just have to wait.
00:19:27.333,00:19:30.083,"No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm-- I'm just trying to make a call."
00:19:31.750,00:19:33.583,Understood. Understood. Um...
00:19:34.333,00:19:36.875,-The phones aren't working right now. -Okay. Okay.
00:19:42.000,00:19:43.083,What? No. No.
00:19:43.166,00:19:46.000,-I feel like you may have a concussion. -I am fine. I'm fine.
00:19:46.083,00:19:47.250,-Okay. Okay. -I am fine.
00:19:47.833,00:19:48.750,Okay.
00:19:54.000,00:19:55.250,We were just driving.
00:19:59.416,00:20:00.875,And then she saw something.
00:20:01.458,00:20:05.750,"I didn't see what it was, but then she got this look on her face."
00:20:24.375,00:20:28.416,"She got so sad, and Jess does not get sad."
00:20:29.000,00:20:30.041,No.
00:20:31.250,00:20:34.250,She stepped out of the car and ran into the street...
00:20:36.833,00:20:38.166,She would never do that.
00:20:39.791,00:20:41.208,But it was...
00:20:41.291,00:20:48.166,"And then that woman-- that woman, she saw me, and then she started talking to her mom and I..."
00:20:54.708,00:20:58.458,And she wasn't talking to her mother. Her mother's been dead ten years.
00:22:18.916,00:22:19.791,Hello?
00:22:20.916,00:22:22.750,"Hello, can anybody hear me? Hello?"
00:22:27.833,00:22:29.541,Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello.
00:22:31.458,00:22:33.833,"Is anybody out there? Hello, my name is Malorie."
00:22:33.916,00:22:35.875,I'm on the river. Is anybody out there?
00:22:36.708,00:22:38.666,Hello? Hello? Is anybody out there?
00:22:40.541,00:22:42.458,Can anybody hear me? Hello?
00:23:14.291,00:23:15.708,Station's lines are down.
00:23:15.791,00:23:17.916,I can't get in touch with anyone.
00:23:18.000,00:23:20.666,We haven't heard anything from any authorities...
00:23:20.750,00:23:28.250,"but if you are listening, from what I can gather, as long as you stay indoors, as long as you don't look at those things..."
00:23:29.083,00:23:30.500,you should be fine.
00:23:30.583,00:23:32.333,Do not go outside.
00:23:32.416,00:23:36.666,"The moment I receive any more news, I will be sure to update you."
00:23:36.750,00:23:40.833,My husband works in trusts and estates. What kind of law do you practice?
00:23:40.916,00:23:43.791,-Bankruptcy. -When he's not suing his neighbors.
00:23:47.666,00:23:50.875,Because some of us don't understand the concept of rationing.
00:23:51.541,00:23:53.208,"Douglas, your house is behind this one."
00:23:53.291,00:23:55.125,"When we finish this, let's go for a food run."
00:23:55.208,00:24:08.958,"We'd never make it back. What you don't understand is-- Okay, just calm down."
00:24:14.083,00:24:15.750,-You're making a big mistake. -Douglas.
00:24:21.583,00:24:23.833,-Don't open the goddamn-- -I'm gonna open the door.
00:24:27.708,00:24:29.083,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:24:31.166,00:24:32.208,Move.
00:24:36.125,00:24:37.125,Go ahead.
00:24:39.708,00:24:41.916,Go get a-- Go get a blanket. Go get a blanket.
00:24:43.708,00:24:45.541,There should be two lamps on either side of the door.
00:24:45.625,00:24:49.041,I'm gonna hand you a blanket and I want you to drape it across the both of them.
00:24:50.291,00:24:52.000,I need you to block the view for me.
00:25:10.875,00:25:11.791,"Tom, is this safe?"
00:25:18.875,00:25:19.875,Hold on. Hold on.
00:25:26.708,00:25:28.250,"-The gun, please. -Yeah."
00:25:28.333,00:25:31.833,"Yeah, before you kill someone with it since you have no idea how it works."
00:25:43.541,00:25:44.583,How...
00:25:45.125,00:25:46.541,There are so many of you.
00:25:46.625,00:25:48.208,"So are you, um..."
00:25:49.458,00:25:50.833,Are-- Are you pregnant?
00:25:51.958,00:25:54.083,Yeah. October 1st.
00:25:55.875,00:25:56.791,What about you?
00:25:59.500,00:26:01.583,"Uh, end of, uh, September."
00:26:06.833,00:26:08.333,"Yeah, I am."
00:26:08.416,00:26:11.833,My husband was deployed last month 'cause he's in the Air Force.
00:26:11.916,00:26:14.541,"I tried to make stuff last as long as I could, um..."
00:26:15.166,00:26:19.875,"but I was so hungry and I was afraid I would starve my baby, so I didn't know what to do."
00:26:21.500,00:26:24.000,So you left and started knocking on random doors?
00:26:25.791,00:26:29.000,"Great, now we can all starve here in the maternity ward."
00:26:30.333,00:26:32.500,It just means we need to get more supplies.
00:26:32.583,00:26:34.958,"Of course, but we can't get anything if we can't see."
00:26:35.041,00:26:36.708,"Oh, we're so fucking trapped."
00:26:37.291,00:26:38.291,Maybe not.
00:26:39.750,00:26:41.375,Maybe we can see better than we thought.
00:26:48.208,00:26:51.083,We have cameras around the house transmitting a live feed.
00:26:51.750,00:26:53.250,Come upstairs. Come on.
00:26:59.875,00:27:03.458,It just shows the color temperatures of the objects. It's neutered information.
00:27:03.541,00:27:06.208,-Colors on a flat screen. -But an image can still have power.
00:27:06.291,00:27:08.250,We have no idea how these things can operate.
00:27:08.333,00:27:09.875,These images are not direct.
00:27:10.916,00:27:15.291,"We can't look at whatever it is with the naked eye, but maybe we can with a translator."
00:27:16.291,00:27:17.166,Pixels and heat.
00:27:17.250,00:27:18.375,Maybe it won't even show up.
00:27:18.458,00:27:22.458,"Well, we're not gonna find out until one of us takes a look."
00:27:23.583,00:27:25.208,I think it's a huge mistake.
00:27:25.291,00:27:28.083,"You would, Douglas. You think everything is a huge mistake."
00:27:28.666,00:27:30.625,Sooner or later we're gonna have to do something.
00:27:30.708,00:27:32.833,We don't know how long we're gonna have electricity.
00:27:32.916,00:27:35.708,You gotta trust me on this. I really think this is gonna work.
00:27:36.250,00:27:38.041,Okay. Okay.
00:27:38.125,00:27:45.625,"Maybe if it does, we could use the technology for supply runs or--- I hope you know what you're doing."
00:27:45.708,00:27:51.416,"Listen... you and your husband, you're good people."
00:27:51.500,00:27:54.875,"You know, it wasn't... It wasn't that."
00:27:55.791,00:27:57.125,"Thank you, Douglas."
00:27:59.875,00:28:01.291,You don't have to do this.
00:28:01.875,00:28:03.791,I know. Don't worry.
00:28:05.958,00:28:08.583,"-Tom, I need the remote. -Yeah."
00:28:08.666,00:28:09.833,"There you go, bud."
00:28:40.333,00:28:41.583,So why are you suing him?
00:28:41.666,00:28:46.000,'Cause they want to tear down this part of their house and build some glass monstrosity.
00:28:46.083,00:28:47.750,His husband's an architect.
00:28:47.833,00:28:51.333,It's his property. Why do you care what he builds?
00:28:52.625,00:28:54.333,Because I have to look at it.
00:29:23.500,00:29:25.000,Not a chance.
00:29:27.083,00:29:30.250,"Well, the world's ending, baby, so you never know."
00:30:17.125,00:30:18.250,"Come on, Greg."
00:30:20.458,00:30:21.333,Focus.
00:30:34.416,00:30:37.375,"It's, uh... It's about the end of the world."
00:30:38.291,00:30:39.375,My novel.
00:30:40.250,00:30:46.958,But it's not one of those kids' stories where they all got crossbows and they're killing each other to survive or running around some giant maze.
00:30:50.541,00:30:51.750,This story's gonna be real.
00:30:52.333,00:30:55.041,Did you ever think it was gonna be anything like this?
00:31:23.958,00:31:25.375,"Greg! Greg, can we come in?"
00:31:25.458,00:31:26.875,-What's going on? -Greg!
00:31:32.416,00:31:34.708,Cover your eyes! Cover your eyes. Find the monitor.
00:31:56.416,00:31:58.625,I fucking told him that it was a mistake.
00:32:07.625,00:32:09.291,We're never getting out of here.
00:32:50.625,00:32:51.500,Hi.
00:32:52.125,00:32:53.000,Hi.
00:32:53.083,00:32:54.291,Yeah.
00:32:54.375,00:32:57.333,I thought it might be good for us to be close considering...
00:32:59.250,00:33:00.125,Sure.
00:33:05.291,00:33:12.750,I read this blog post once about how pregnant women should always sleep next to someone because the baby can sense when the mother is lonely.
00:33:13.375,00:33:14.458,Perfect.
00:33:16.041,00:33:19.375,"So, um... have you thought about names yet?"
00:33:20.541,00:33:22.083,"No, not yet."
00:33:23.291,00:33:24.333,How about you?
00:33:25.458,00:33:30.041,"Well, if it's a girl we wanted to name her, like, Ariel or Jasmine."
00:33:30.125,00:33:34.333,"I mean, I would love to name her Cinderella and just call her Ella."
00:33:36.875,00:33:39.500,And what did your husband like?
00:33:39.583,00:33:41.291,He loves everything I love.
00:33:43.958,00:33:46.500,What about you? Does your husband have a favorite?
00:33:47.333,00:33:48.541,"Oh, it's just me."
00:33:49.458,00:33:52.125,"-Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry. -No, it's fine. It's fine."
00:33:52.875,00:33:58.500,"Well, what about your family? They must be excited-- Do you know what? Could you just excuse me for one second?"
00:33:58.583,00:33:59.625,I'll be right back.
00:34:54.000,00:34:55.000,Sorry.
00:34:58.125,00:35:00.458,That's something you can't unsee.
00:35:01.791,00:35:04.000,"Ah, no. No, you cannot."
00:35:05.208,00:35:06.083,Yeah.
00:35:09.416,00:35:10.291,Shh.
00:35:11.791,00:35:13.583,"-Shh, shh. -Hmm."
00:35:22.041,00:35:23.166,Yeah.
00:35:24.458,00:35:26.375,I'll wait to do my laundry in the morning.
00:35:27.458,00:35:29.583,"-That's probably a good idea. -Yeah, I think so."
00:35:29.666,00:35:30.791,Good night.
00:36:06.708,00:36:08.250,You guys need some help?
00:36:10.583,00:36:14.250,-It's okay to take your blindfolds off. -Do not take your blindfolds off. Do not!
00:36:18.791,00:36:21.208,Get down! Get down! Get down! Down. Down. Down.
00:36:33.083,00:36:35.125,Have you ever seen a baby deer?
00:36:36.250,00:36:37.708,I'll tell you a secret.
00:36:38.500,00:36:40.208,I found one in the woods.
00:36:47.666,00:36:51.083,"Okay. I know you're scared. Well, listen, there's no need."
00:36:56.375,00:36:58.291,I'm not here to hurt you. I can pull you to shore.
00:37:13.041,00:37:14.166,Ah!
00:37:23.958,00:37:26.666,I've seen one. I've seen the truth.
00:37:27.791,00:37:29.833,Take your blindfold off.
00:37:57.416,00:37:58.625,Everyone must look.
00:37:59.375,00:38:01.208,Everyone must look.
00:38:14.458,00:38:17.458,All right. We're running out of food and there's no help coming.
00:38:17.541,00:38:19.208,We've got to get outside.
00:38:22.333,00:38:24.458,"Look, I might know where we can get more."
00:38:25.458,00:38:27.458,"-Where, Charlie? -The Fields market."
00:38:28.708,00:38:31.125,I locked the place up when everything started going crazy.
00:38:31.208,00:38:34.666,-You're just telling us this? -At least we know now. Thank you.
00:38:34.750,00:38:37.250,"Okay, so we'll need a group of us to go."
00:38:37.333,00:38:39.125,Whoa. We'll be dead before we get there.
00:38:39.208,00:38:40.833,-Are you kidding me? -I'll go.
00:38:40.916,00:38:43.166,"-Well, if he's going, I'm going. -You're pregnant!"
00:38:43.250,00:38:46.750,"Well, if all you guys are going, then I can come too."
00:38:46.833,00:38:51.250,Why don't I go on the first run and then you can go on the second run?
00:38:52.708,00:38:54.958,-It's a death wish. -I have the training. It'll be fine.
00:38:55.041,00:38:57.875,I don't like this. I don't think anyone should go.
00:39:00.458,00:39:02.750,Charlie's going? Charlie ain't going nowhere.
00:39:02.833,00:39:05.208,-You know the security system. -No chance I'm going.
00:39:05.291,00:39:07.208,I gave you the information. That's all you needed.
00:39:07.291,00:39:09.833,You don't need me to tell you where to go. It is a supermarket.
00:39:09.916,00:39:12.000,They got signs. You've been shopping before.
00:39:12.083,00:39:14.000,"You wanna get cereal, the sign will say cereals."
00:39:14.083,00:39:15.958,"If you can't read, I get it, but you can read."
00:39:16.625,00:39:20.791,-No. You don't need me to go with you-- -Charlie. It'll be research for the book.
00:39:20.875,00:39:22.833,Okay? Be awesome.
00:39:26.791,00:39:32.250,"All right, so the idea is if we can black out all the windows, it's efficient and it's safe."
00:39:32.333,00:39:33.875,Is anybody else hearing this?
00:39:34.500,00:39:36.083,How is driving blind safer?
00:39:36.166,00:39:37.083,We're not.
00:39:37.166,00:39:38.458,We've got the GPS.
00:40:35.791,00:40:38.625,"In half a mile, turn right onto Bay Street."
00:40:39.500,00:40:41.500,-What is that? -It's a curb.
00:40:41.583,00:40:42.791,It's just a curb.
00:40:48.125,00:40:50.041,It's a proximity sensor.
00:41:02.833,00:41:05.000,Just a speed bump. It's just a speed bump.
00:41:28.791,00:41:30.750,"-Are we off the road? -No, there's something."
00:41:31.333,00:41:34.208,-I think it must be just a truck. -Just go around.
00:41:34.291,00:41:36.250,"-Keep going around it. -Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:38.750,00:41:39.958,What was that?
00:41:50.375,00:41:52.041,Is somebody else driving out there?
00:42:06.291,00:42:08.208,-Get the fuck out! -Charlie! Calm down.
00:42:08.291,00:42:10.291,"Guys, stop touching him."
00:42:10.375,00:42:12.916,-Look at me. You have to be quiet. -Shut him up.
00:42:25.541,00:42:26.916,Fuck! We're not gonna make it.
00:42:34.416,00:42:36.458,Hold on to something. Gonna move!
00:42:38.833,00:42:39.958,Hold on!
00:42:40.041,00:42:41.500,That's not a fucking speed bump!
00:42:41.583,00:42:43.541,"-Fuck, it's stuck. -Hold on."
00:42:59.333,00:43:01.791,"And after all this, we're supposed to get out now?"
00:43:02.583,00:43:03.541,Lucky us.
00:43:10.000,00:43:11.333,"...two, three."
00:43:33.083,00:43:34.250,-You're in? -No.
00:43:34.333,00:43:35.708,Okay. Wait. Almost got it.
00:43:36.250,00:43:37.166,"Okay, I got it."
00:43:39.208,00:43:40.125,Go on.
00:43:47.375,00:43:48.541,All right. We're in.
00:43:50.666,00:43:52.625,-Hello! -Shh! Shh!
00:43:54.333,00:43:55.500,I'll check the windows.
00:43:56.250,00:43:57.958,Here we go. Here we go.
00:44:15.375,00:44:16.875,"Oh, my God."
00:44:17.458,00:44:19.666,-Jack-fucking-pot. -Yeah.
00:44:21.041,00:44:22.750,-Where are the canned goods? -Aisle two.
00:44:22.833,00:44:24.166,-Toilet paper? -Five.
00:44:24.250,00:44:26.666,-Fuck that. Where's the booze? -It's in seven.
00:44:26.750,00:44:30.750,"Let's not forget. We have limited space. Stick to non-perishables, the necessities."
00:44:30.833,00:44:32.625,-Where are the electronics? -Go to six.
00:44:35.041,00:44:36.541,I'm not cleaning this shit up.
00:44:39.375,00:44:40.500,Sweet.
00:44:47.375,00:44:49.291,"Boy, I'm glad I tagged along."
00:44:49.875,00:44:53.166,This is truly the happiest place on Earth.
00:44:53.250,00:44:55.333,I know. You're not kidding!
00:45:00.791,00:45:04.958,"It's, uh... my baby shower gift to you."
00:45:06.708,00:45:07.708,"Why, thank you."
00:45:09.083,00:45:12.208,"So, my sister is expecting her fourth, so..."
00:45:12.708,00:45:15.250,"Oh, my God. She's a saint."
00:45:15.333,00:45:16.541,"Yeah, she is."
00:45:17.583,00:45:19.708,And I'm always touching her belly.
00:45:20.958,00:45:22.000,It's calming.
00:45:22.500,00:45:24.750,"Yeah, it's nature's dirty little trick."
00:45:28.958,00:45:30.458,Is your sister in Sacramento?
00:45:32.500,00:45:33.625,-Yeah. -Yeah?
00:45:33.708,00:45:34.666,Yeah.
00:45:39.916,00:45:42.750,What about you? Where did you-- Where did you grow up?
00:45:42.833,00:45:44.333,"Oh, just outside of Stockton."
00:45:44.416,00:45:45.916,-Stockton. -Yeah.
00:45:46.000,00:45:48.041,-We raised horses. -On a real ranch?
00:45:48.625,00:45:52.500,"-Well, my daddy was a real cowboy. -That's--That's how you learned your..."
00:45:52.583,00:45:54.041,-What? -...little shotgun trick.
00:45:54.125,00:45:56.375,Yeah. I had an interesting childhood.
00:45:56.458,00:45:57.333,Hmm.
00:45:58.041,00:46:01.416,"Ah, but Stockton wasn't all that far from Sacramento."
00:46:01.500,00:46:03.750,No. Just down 99.
00:46:03.833,00:46:06.208,"-Just down Highway 99. -Worlds apart, right?"
00:46:07.666,00:46:10.125,Still we could've met some other way.
00:46:11.375,00:46:12.333,Sure.
00:46:13.000,00:46:15.125,Could have been your babysitter.
00:46:17.416,00:46:19.041,My hot babysitter.
00:46:22.208,00:46:26.041,You're... You're only saying that 'cause we're all gonna die.
00:46:27.791,00:46:28.666,Possibly.
00:47:09.458,00:47:10.500,Huh?
00:47:12.041,00:47:13.041,Hi.
00:47:15.208,00:47:16.375,"Hi, there."
00:47:20.750,00:47:22.458,So sleepy.
00:47:27.583,00:47:31.541,"I have a big, big, big, big, big announcement to make."
00:47:31.625,00:47:34.541,"-Ladies and gentlemen, please... -Yes, Douglas."
00:47:35.125,00:47:40.833,I would like to take this opportunity to make a toast to all of us...
00:47:41.416,00:47:48.250,"because all of us, collectively, are making the end of the world..."
00:47:51.666,00:47:55.041,great again! Yeah!
00:47:59.708,00:48:00.583,Birdies.
00:48:02.500,00:48:05.875,"I mean, don't you doofuses get it?"
00:48:06.583,00:48:08.958,"Uh, we could just stay here."
00:48:09.041,00:48:14.250,We have a year's supply of food and drink right here.
00:48:14.333,00:48:17.666,We don't ever have to pay and we shouldn't ever leave.
00:48:17.750,00:48:19.958,And what are they gonna do at Greg's? Starve?
00:48:24.416,00:48:27.708,We have everything we need to live here. Everything.
00:48:27.791,00:48:34.083,"There is no statistical, logical, or legal argument for trying to get back there."
00:48:34.166,00:48:37.291,Here's an argument: we're not assholes.
00:48:39.541,00:48:40.833,And we're not staying.
00:48:50.083,00:48:51.000,What is it?
00:48:59.250,00:49:00.416,It's a loading dock.
00:49:08.000,00:49:10.875,Please let me in.
00:49:11.625,00:49:12.625,Cover your eyes.
00:49:16.625,00:49:18.250,I have to open the door.
00:49:23.166,00:49:24.291,Okay. Uh...
00:49:24.958,00:49:25.958,Okay.
00:49:29.333,00:49:30.875,-Hello? -Hello.
00:49:33.875,00:49:36.625,"Wait, wait, wait. Is that... Fish Fingers, is that you?"
00:49:40.041,00:49:43.000,He works here at the supermarket with me. He works in the seafood department.
00:49:43.083,00:49:46.458,"He's been to prison and he's a bit crazy, but he's always nice to me."
00:49:46.541,00:49:48.833,"-How did you get there, man? -I got... I got..."
00:49:50.666,00:49:51.625,Who's they?
00:49:51.708,00:49:53.708,Who you talking about? Are you there alone?
00:49:53.791,00:49:55.750,They tricked me and they left me to rot here.
00:49:55.833,00:49:57.875,Who left you to rot? What are you talking about?
00:50:00.083,00:50:01.375,There's something wrong!
00:50:01.458,00:50:04.375,-Please let me in. I'm trapped. -Hey. Hey. Hey.
00:50:04.458,00:50:06.750,"What are you doin', Fish Fingers? What are you doing, man?"
00:50:23.708,00:50:25.000,Fuck! Ah!
00:50:32.166,00:50:34.000,-Charlie? -Charlie!
00:50:43.041,00:50:44.041,Fuck!
00:50:49.833,00:50:51.666,We gotta move. Come on. Let's go.
00:50:51.750,00:50:52.958,Let's get out of here.
00:51:27.958,00:51:29.583,"Hi, Felix!"
00:51:30.750,00:51:33.166,"Oh, my God. Look at all this stuff."
00:51:36.166,00:51:38.666,They seem to sense when the creatures are around.
00:51:39.250,00:51:40.625,Where's Charlie?
00:51:42.583,00:51:45.291,Another novel I won't have to read.
00:51:45.375,00:51:47.791,"He saved us, you fucking asshole."
00:52:12.291,00:52:14.208,"You know, in the divorce petition..."
00:52:15.166,00:52:20.625,my first wife said that to call me a creep would be an affront to creeps everywhere.
00:52:22.291,00:52:28.416,"My second wife said she no longer feared going to hell, 'cause it couldn't possibly be worse than being married to me."
00:52:29.000,00:52:30.583,Think I would have loved them.
00:52:32.125,00:52:33.208,And then Lydia.
00:52:34.166,00:52:37.083,Third time really was the charm for me.
00:52:38.625,00:52:40.875,She was the kindest person I ever met.
00:52:41.791,00:52:44.375,But I'm here and she's gone. You know why that is?
00:52:44.458,00:52:47.041,"Because, in the end, there are only two types of people."
00:52:47.125,00:52:49.125,The assholes and the dead.
00:52:52.083,00:52:53.250,Like your father? Why?
00:52:53.333,00:52:58.583,Was he a towering intellect given to dispensing wisdom to undeserving fools?
00:52:58.666,00:53:00.500,"Yes, he was fluent in asshole as well."
00:53:01.541,00:53:09.125,"And just like you, he blamed everything he did on some deeper meaning, convoluted conspiracy theories and..."
00:53:10.375,00:53:13.041,how it was everybody else's fault when he was clearly in the wrong.
00:53:13.125,00:53:20.250,"But, you know, once my sister and I realized it was just an excuse to treat his family like shit, it made life a little easier."
00:53:20.333,00:53:23.291,You know what though? I see one difference between us.
00:53:24.500,00:53:25.458,Hmm?
00:53:25.541,00:53:26.583,I'm never wrong.
00:53:27.166,00:53:28.291,You are...
00:53:28.375,00:53:29.791,You're two pricks in a pod.
00:53:30.791,00:53:32.333,Do I look like him as well?
00:53:33.166,00:53:34.125,Mm...
00:53:35.166,00:53:36.166,Not really.
00:53:37.166,00:53:40.458,"-He wasn't exquisitely handsome? -It's not that, it's just..."
00:53:42.375,00:53:44.458,the hair... the hair is different.
00:53:44.541,00:53:45.916,-The hair? -Yeah.
00:53:46.958,00:53:48.041,He had some.
00:53:48.625,00:53:49.458,Oh.
00:53:58.375,00:54:00.041,"Oh, I can't."
00:54:00.125,00:54:02.875,"Oh, come on, the world is ending."
00:54:02.958,00:54:06.875,"I really don't think a quarter-ounce of whiskey's gonna tip the scales, do you?"
00:54:10.375,00:54:11.291,Well...
00:54:12.416,00:54:13.833,I hope you're wrong.
00:54:14.916,00:54:16.708,About the assholes and the dead.
00:54:19.000,00:54:20.375,I hope there is more.
00:54:22.125,00:54:24.375,Here's to hoping there is more.
00:55:00.458,00:55:02.250,Where's the goddamn car?
00:55:02.333,00:55:04.458,"You guys. You guys, where are Lucy and Felix?"
00:55:13.333,00:55:14.375,Fuck.
00:55:43.416,00:55:44.583,You stopped rowing.
00:55:45.458,00:55:46.791,I'm just taking a break.
00:55:48.083,00:55:49.583,How much longer?
00:55:49.666,00:55:50.708,A few hours.
00:56:17.916,00:56:20.333,Malorie! Malorie!
00:56:20.416,00:56:21.541,Help!
00:56:23.041,00:56:23.875,Malorie!
00:56:29.625,00:56:31.791,-Are you okay? Are you okay? -Yes.
00:56:31.875,00:56:34.333,-I'm cold. -I know. I know you're cold. Hold on.
00:56:37.750,00:56:42.291,"No, no, no, no, no, no. All the food and blankets. God damn it!"
00:56:45.208,00:56:46.166,Hold on.
00:56:46.791,00:56:48.791,Okay. All right.
00:56:51.916,00:56:55.083,"We're gonna get you warmed up, okay? We're gonna get you warmed up."
00:56:56.833,00:56:59.000,Put this around you.
00:56:59.083,00:57:01.041,Keep your blindfolds on. Stay tight.
00:57:05.083,00:57:06.583,Did you hear that?
00:57:06.666,00:57:07.666,Did you hear that?
00:57:18.500,00:57:21.041,"Lay down on the bottom of the boat. Lay down, really flat."
00:57:21.125,00:57:23.541,I need you to be quiet. I'm gonna leave the birds with you.
00:57:23.625,00:57:26.541,"I'm gonna cover you up, but do not make a sound and do not leave this boat."
00:57:26.625,00:57:28.083,Understand? Do not leave this boat!
00:59:00.500,00:59:01.625,Shit.
01:00:51.500,01:00:53.250,Malorie.
01:00:55.750,01:00:57.666,Malorie.
01:01:07.041,01:01:09.833,Something is wrong with Malorie.
01:01:12.250,01:01:13.333,Ah! Ah!
01:01:46.791,01:01:47.833,Malorie?
01:01:53.541,01:01:54.583,Malorie?
01:02:07.958,01:02:09.916,I told you to stay on the boat.
01:02:10.000,01:02:11.041,You don't think.
01:02:11.125,01:02:13.500,"You do exactly what I say or you die, do you understand me?"
01:02:13.583,01:02:16.250,"If something happens to me, do not try and help me."
01:02:16.333,01:02:18.166,Forget about me and try to save yourself.
01:02:18.250,01:02:19.625,Do you understand?
01:02:19.708,01:02:22.833,"Say it! If something happens to me, what do you do?"
01:02:22.916,01:02:25.291,You save yourself. Say it!
01:02:25.916,01:02:27.916,-I save myself. -You save yourself.
01:02:57.541,01:02:58.791,It sure feels like it.
01:03:02.541,01:03:08.250,"At the end of my deployment in Iraq, we were stationed at this village..."
01:03:10.541,01:03:13.500,"ordered to patrol the streets, make sure everybody was safe."
01:03:15.833,01:03:16.958,"One morning, we saw..."
01:03:18.416,01:03:21.000,this father walking with his four kids.
01:03:21.083,01:03:26.166,So I pulled over to make sure everything was okay and to make sure he got wherever he was going safely.
01:03:29.166,01:03:31.333,"Come to find out, he was walking his kids to school."
01:03:33.583,01:03:39.250,"In the middle of all that shit, all that chaos, he was walking his kids to school."
01:03:46.333,01:03:47.208,So...
01:03:50.791,01:03:52.208,So we just followed him.
01:03:53.750,01:03:54.833,Day after day.
01:03:55.458,01:03:56.500,We escorted him.
01:03:59.958,01:04:01.416,That just became our routine.
01:04:05.000,01:04:10.250,"And then, at the end of our time, he gave me this when it was time to come back home."
01:04:16.750,01:04:17.625,Mm.
01:04:23.833,01:04:26.500,I like to think he's still walking his kids to school.
01:05:09.541,01:05:12.125,"This is Malorie. Anybody, can you hear me? Hello?"
01:05:15.250,01:05:18.583,Can anybody hear me? Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me?
01:05:20.958,01:05:22.833,"Hello? Testing, hello?"
01:05:25.208,01:05:27.166,"Hello, is anyone out there? Hello?"
01:05:32.291,01:05:33.708,Do you have a blindfold on?
01:05:34.375,01:05:37.625,You do. Is-- Is the blanket behind you still up?
01:05:39.875,01:05:42.250,"Okay, just come in really, really quickly."
01:05:42.333,01:05:45.791,Thank you. Here's my blindfold. Thank you so much.
01:05:45.875,01:05:49.375,It's okay. Just wait. Wait here. Malorie!
01:05:49.458,01:05:51.208,"-I gotta pee. -Olympia, what are you doing?"
01:05:51.291,01:05:52.541,-Malorie! -What are you doing?
01:05:56.500,01:05:58.458,-He's just scared. -Tom. Check the bag.
01:06:01.125,01:06:02.750,-Who are you? -Who is this guy?
01:06:02.833,01:06:05.083,"Tom, I've got him. Check the bag. Check the bag."
01:06:05.666,01:06:07.041,-Who is this? -He's just scared.
01:06:07.125,01:06:08.583,-Who are you? -How did he get in here?
01:06:08.666,01:06:12.208,"-Shut up, Olympia. Who are you? -He was scared, okay? I just let him in."
01:06:12.291,01:06:14.666,-You let a stranger in the house! -I'm sorry.
01:06:14.750,01:06:16.416,-He was terrified! -Are you a simpleton?
01:06:16.958,01:06:18.958,"Oh, God. Okay. Please."
01:06:19.041,01:06:20.416,My name is Gary.
01:06:21.291,01:06:22.416,I live in the city.
01:06:22.916,01:06:27.250,"When these things came, I got the first train out with some colleagues because we thought it would be safe."
01:06:29.833,01:06:34.041,"Please, please just let me stay here. They're after me."
01:06:34.625,01:06:35.875,Who's after you?
01:06:36.500,01:06:38.583,-I don't believe it. He's lying. -Who's after you?
01:06:38.666,01:06:39.791,It's obvious he's lying.
01:06:39.875,01:06:41.375,-I swear. -Why are you here?
01:06:41.458,01:06:45.416,We went to my colleague Carl's house to lay low.
01:06:45.500,01:06:49.250,Everything was fine until they broke in.
01:06:50.541,01:06:52.333,Creatures don't break into people's homes.
01:06:52.416,01:06:54.500,"No, not the creatures, these psychos."
01:06:56.375,01:06:58.333,These psychos from Northwood.
01:07:00.916,01:07:03.625,It's a mental institution for the criminally insane.
01:07:03.708,01:07:06.916,"Well, it's nice to know they have hall passes now."
01:07:07.708,01:07:08.583,And then what?
01:07:08.666,01:07:15.458,They took us outside and they forced our eyes open so that we would have to look at the creatures.
01:07:18.875,01:07:21.041,-Did you look? -No.
01:07:21.125,01:07:29.125,"Somehow, my friend Carl managed to tackle one of these people to the ground and the rest of us made a run for it."
01:07:29.208,01:07:32.625,I just kept on running and running and running till I got here.
01:07:33.791,01:07:37.375,I've been knocking on all the doors and nobody answered.
01:07:38.958,01:07:40.750,"Until you did, so..."
01:07:42.791,01:07:43.666,Thank you.
01:07:54.458,01:07:55.416,Birds.
01:07:56.666,01:08:01.625,"The scariest thing was, uh... when these people broke in, they..."
01:08:04.000,01:08:05.833,they weren't wearing blindfolds.
01:08:07.625,01:08:09.083,It's like they didn't need them.
01:08:09.166,01:08:11.666,But they'd been outside. You have to wear blindfolds.
01:08:11.750,01:08:12.750,Not these people.
01:08:13.916,01:08:16.833,These crazy guys weren't affected like everyone else.
01:08:16.916,01:08:18.458,They wanted to see.
01:08:19.166,01:08:20.041,They were happy.
01:08:21.250,01:08:23.458,They were so glad.
01:08:25.208,01:08:28.500,And they said everyone needed to see.
01:08:37.416,01:08:41.916,"New guy, you had a great visit. We really loved meeting you. Now fuck off."
01:08:42.500,01:08:46.333,"And anybody who doesn't agree, you go with him."
01:08:46.416,01:08:48.583,"-Out now! -Douglas, that is murder."
01:08:48.666,01:08:50.083,No. This is murder.
01:08:50.166,01:08:53.041,-Please. -Letting strangers into this house.
01:08:53.625,01:08:58.583,Every contact we have had with the outside has brought us death.
01:08:58.666,01:09:00.583,"Lydia, Greg, Charlie."
01:09:00.666,01:09:05.541,"If you wanna save people out there, then you go right through that door and you go do it."
01:09:05.625,01:09:08.375,We're not bringing any more strangers in here.
01:09:08.958,01:09:10.250,Not while I'm alive.
01:09:10.333,01:09:22.750,"I won't tell you again, get up and get-- Thank you."
01:09:35.333,01:09:39.875,The only reason I opened that door is 'cause I remember what it felt like to be outside of it.
01:09:41.083,01:09:43.166,"If you guys hadn't let me in, I..."
01:09:46.250,01:09:48.791,"You are no more a burden than I am, okay?"
01:09:48.875,01:09:50.458,-That's not true. -It is. It is.
01:09:50.541,01:09:52.041,You're not soft like me.
01:09:53.041,01:09:55.583,I'm so spoiled.
01:09:56.458,01:10:04.166,"My parents have always done everything for me and then my husband, and I just... I got soft from all that love."
01:10:05.500,01:10:08.458,"Well, I was raised by wolves, so consider yourself lucky."
01:10:12.208,01:10:17.250,"If something happens to me, I want you to take care of my baby."
01:10:18.125,01:10:19.041,Okay?
01:10:19.541,01:10:20.791,-No. No. -Please.
01:10:20.875,01:10:22.166,-It's your baby. -Malorie.
01:10:22.250,01:10:23.500,No.
01:10:23.583,01:10:25.750,-Promise me. -Nothing is gonna happen to you.
01:10:25.833,01:10:26.666,It's your baby.
01:10:26.750,01:10:29.458,-Promise me. -Nothing-- Please promise me.
01:10:31.958,01:10:34.125,"Yeah, okay. Yeah, of course."
01:10:41.750,01:10:43.041,What is this?
01:10:44.083,01:10:49.750,"Well, if I was just gonna tell you, I wouldn't have bothered putting it in this fancy-- this fancy bag."
01:10:55.000,01:10:56.666,I got it on the supply run.
01:11:04.416,01:11:05.791,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
01:11:10.833,01:11:13.333,I know it's not the baby shower you've always dreamt of.
01:11:13.416,01:11:15.958,"No, it's-- It's perfect."
01:11:16.958,01:11:20.500,"And you can give it to your little one when she's old enough, okay?"
01:11:42.041,01:11:45.000,"You guys, the river's speeding up. It's time for a meeting."
01:11:59.708,01:12:01.875,I need to talk to you about the rapids.
01:12:02.541,01:12:04.875,The rapids are where the water gets very bumpy.
01:12:04.958,01:12:10.916,"It's very loud. It's very dangerous, and it's gonna be the hardest thing we have ever done."
01:12:12.375,01:12:17.333,"And when we reach them, one of you is gonna have a very important job."
01:12:20.000,01:12:22.041,One of you is gonna have to look.
01:12:24.375,01:12:33.041,"And the person who looks, they have to tell me which direction to steer into so that I go the right way."
01:12:34.666,01:12:37.375,"Because if I look, we won't make it."
01:12:41.125,01:12:42.791,What if we see something?
01:12:43.791,01:12:45.500,"-I'll do it. -No, no, no, no."
01:12:45.583,01:12:48.833,"I'm-- I'm the one who will say who looks, okay? I say it."
01:12:49.416,01:12:51.875,I'll say who goes. I'll say who looks.
01:12:52.458,01:12:53.625,I say who looks.
01:13:21.625,01:13:24.916,Testing. Testing. Hello? Hello? Is anyone out there?
01:13:25.000,01:13:27.125,"Hello? Testing, one, two, three. Hello?"
01:13:34.208,01:13:36.375,-I love this song. -Me too.
01:13:36.458,01:13:37.708,-Me too. -Me too.
01:13:38.916,01:13:40.875,-I've never actually heard it before. -Hmm.
01:13:57.375,01:13:58.875,We're going upstairs to the bedroom.
01:13:58.958,01:14:03.166,"We need towels, sponges, um... scissors, and lots of water."
01:14:03.250,01:14:06.666,Buckets of water. It's okay. It's okay.
01:14:10.750,01:14:12.708,Take it easy. I've got you.
01:14:45.208,01:14:50.291,"Ah, the scissors are in the, um, drawer by the side of your left hand. Yeah."
01:15:01.958,01:15:05.291,"-Okay, so the baby's coming. -No, not happening."
01:15:07.708,01:15:10.083,-Come with me. Come with me. -This is not happening.
01:15:12.833,01:15:15.125,-I have to do the water. -We'll do the water.
01:15:22.083,01:15:23.791,"Okay, here we go."
01:15:29.541,01:15:31.458,"-You two are doing great. -Oh, shut up."
01:16:03.541,01:16:05.250,Come on. Come on.
01:16:42.375,01:16:44.166,It's okay. It's okay.
01:16:47.708,01:16:48.833,It's a boy.
01:16:54.166,01:16:55.125,No.
01:16:56.583,01:16:59.083,And your auntie thought you'd be a girl.
01:17:24.500,01:17:27.375,"Hey, new guy. New guy, let me in."
01:17:27.458,01:17:30.625,Just come and unlock the door. Come on.
01:17:30.708,01:17:32.541,Let me out. What are you doing?
01:17:34.333,01:17:35.208,What?
01:17:41.791,01:17:42.833,What are you doing?
01:17:59.500,01:18:00.500,Gary?
01:18:03.291,01:18:04.416,Gary!
01:18:04.500,01:18:06.500,Hey.
01:18:09.500,01:18:12.416,"Tom, I told you he's fucking crazy."
01:18:22.583,01:18:29.833,Ga-- Tom. Get the shotgun.
01:18:29.916,01:18:31.291,He's crazy.
01:18:38.125,01:18:51.125,What the fuck are you doing? We let you into this house. We let-- No! No! Fuck.
01:18:51.833,01:18:55.750,Fucking asshole. I knew you were a fucking lunatic.
01:18:55.833,01:18:58.708,You fucking piece of shit. We saved you.
01:18:59.833,01:19:00.750,Fuck!
01:19:10.291,01:19:12.208,Yes! Yes!
01:19:12.916,01:19:13.833,Yes.
01:19:13.916,01:19:14.875,Oh.
01:19:14.958,01:19:17.208,"You did it, Mama. You did it."
01:19:21.208,01:19:22.083,Oh.
01:19:22.708,01:19:23.666,Hello.
01:19:25.250,01:19:26.416,You look so beautiful.
01:19:26.500,01:19:28.291,What's going on down there?
01:19:31.125,01:19:32.000,Can I see?
01:19:42.166,01:19:43.750,So beautiful.
01:19:47.458,01:19:48.708,Can I see yours?
01:19:56.625,01:19:57.500,Wow.
01:20:00.083,01:20:00.958,Hum.
01:20:01.750,01:20:02.958,Thank you.
01:20:05.166,01:20:06.333,Look at this.
01:20:07.291,01:20:08.291,Look at this.
01:20:12.791,01:20:16.041,"No. Why are you doing this? Gary, please don't do this."
01:20:17.125,01:20:18.833,"-Look. -Gary, please don't do this."
01:20:21.458,01:20:23.125,"Olympia, cover the baby's eyes."
01:20:23.208,01:20:24.333,Olympia.
01:20:25.000,01:20:26.250,See?
01:20:30.708,01:20:33.000,"-You're not so bad. -Olympia, let me see your baby."
01:20:34.375,01:20:37.666,"Keep the baby's eyes covered. Let me see your baby, just for one minute."
01:20:37.750,01:20:41.250,"Olympia, let me hold your baby just for one minute!"
01:20:41.333,01:20:42.291,Just one minute.
01:20:42.375,01:20:44.583,"Let me hold her for one minute, okay?"
01:20:50.541,01:20:51.541,See!
01:21:00.958,01:21:05.875,"-See it. See it. -No, no, no. No, no, no."
01:21:37.500,01:21:38.833,"Hey, Malorie."
01:21:40.208,01:21:41.416,Give me the children.
01:21:43.958,01:21:45.333,Give me the kids.
01:21:46.666,01:21:48.666,Give me the children or I'll take them!
01:21:48.750,01:21:50.625,"Hey, asshole."
01:21:51.375,01:21:52.291,Hey.
01:21:54.166,01:21:55.166,What are you doing here?
01:21:59.291,01:22:00.375,Have you come to see?
01:22:02.541,01:22:03.666,Open your eyes.
01:22:07.666,01:22:09.333,Don't be frightened.
01:22:10.916,01:22:12.416,Look at me. Look at me.
01:22:12.500,01:22:14.500,Look at me. Look at me!
01:22:21.166,01:22:22.166,Ow.
01:22:48.541,01:22:49.750,I'm sorry.
01:22:53.125,01:22:55.666,I'm sorry that you didn't get to see.
01:22:57.000,01:22:58.541,It is beautiful.
01:22:59.541,01:23:01.000,So beautiful.
01:23:04.083,01:23:05.250,I'm sorry.
01:23:09.916,01:23:11.708,It shall cleanse the world.
01:23:56.750,01:23:59.916,Please don't. Please don't hurt us. Please stay away from us.
01:24:00.000,01:24:02.458,Please. Please. Please. Please.
01:24:02.541,01:24:05.333,Please don't do this. Don't do this. Please don't do this.
01:24:09.291,01:24:11.750,It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
01:24:40.375,01:24:43.625,"Listen to the sounds, if they're softer or louder."
01:24:44.750,01:24:45.958,Listen to this.
01:24:46.708,01:24:48.166,Listen.
01:24:49.083,01:24:51.708,"If they're louder, you're in an open space. Do you hear that?"
01:24:51.791,01:24:55.000,"But if they're softer, something is very close."
01:24:55.083,01:24:57.458,Please. Anyone. Hello? Hello?
01:24:58.250,01:25:03.916,"Hello, hel-- Hello?"
01:26:26.916,01:26:28.916,-Hey. -Hey.
01:26:52.708,01:26:53.708,What's wrong?
01:26:55.583,01:26:57.208,I heard some of them again.
01:26:58.500,01:26:59.458,What?
01:27:00.750,01:27:01.791,A few of 'em...
01:27:02.750,01:27:03.625,driving around.
01:27:05.375,01:27:07.833,Driving around like they're not blindfolded.
01:27:09.875,01:27:10.833,Okay.
01:27:12.583,01:27:13.791,No more runs alone.
01:27:15.583,01:27:16.541,Okay.
01:27:24.250,01:27:26.708,I was thinking like a warning system for the kids.
01:27:26.791,01:27:30.958,"-If they're in trouble, ring the bell. -Right. That's nice."
01:27:37.041,01:27:38.041,How about this?
01:27:39.125,01:27:39.958,"Oh, it's..."
01:27:40.708,01:27:42.041,It's purely survival.
01:27:42.125,01:27:43.875,-Purely survival? -Yeah.
01:28:23.958,01:28:24.833,Hello?
01:28:25.666,01:28:27.625,Is anyone there? Hello?
01:28:29.750,01:28:30.875,Testing. Testing.
01:28:30.958,01:28:33.916,"If there is anyone there, please respond."
01:28:35.708,01:28:37.125,Who is this?
01:28:37.208,01:28:39.041,My name is Rick.
01:28:39.708,01:28:40.625,Who is this?
01:28:43.166,01:28:44.375,"Rick, this is Tom."
01:28:44.458,01:28:45.791,We have a place.
01:28:45.875,01:28:50.916,A compound with enough supplies-- We have a community.
01:28:52.041,01:28:53.625,It's safe here.
01:28:54.416,01:28:56.666,We're down by the river's end.
01:29:00.125,01:29:01.541,Near Pike's Quarry.
01:29:02.125,01:29:05.666,Jesus. You're a ways away. How many of you are there?
01:29:06.583,01:29:08.333,-Four of us. -Hmm-mm.
01:29:08.416,01:29:09.958,Are any of them children?
01:29:10.041,01:29:12.583,"-Don't, do not say anything. -It's okay. It's okay."
01:29:13.750,01:29:16.125,No. Why?
01:29:17.000,01:29:22.416,"Because the fastest way to get here is by the river, and I don't think you could make it with kids."
01:29:25.291,01:29:27.041,Float downstream as far as you can.
01:29:27.125,01:29:29.291,Stay on the water until you hit the rapids.
01:29:30.208,01:29:32.583,The water is fast there. It's dangerous.
01:29:33.125,01:29:34.416,We've lost some people.
01:29:35.291,01:29:37.375,You need to see clearly.
01:29:37.458,01:29:40.083,"-What does that mean? -What do you mean, see clearly?"
01:29:41.250,01:29:43.291,You will have to look.
01:29:44.583,01:29:46.833,"-I'm telling you. -Rick, we'll have blindfolds on."
01:29:46.916,01:29:48.083,We can't look.
01:29:48.166,01:29:50.041,I'm glad you said that.
01:29:50.125,01:29:57.500,Someone will have to take a-- Prepare for two days' journey at the pace of the river's current.
01:29:57.583,01:29:59.166,Bring supplies for longer.
01:29:59.750,01:30:01.875,"How do I find you after the rapids, Rick?"
01:30:01.958,01:30:03.208,You'll hear the birds.
01:30:03.875,01:30:07.041,We've got a lot of them. Just follow the sound to us.
01:30:07.125,01:30:10.500,"Down a small embankment, you'll find a wall with a gate."
01:30:10.583,01:30:15.333,That's our-- -That's their what? -That's our what?
01:30:16.291,01:30:17.166,Rick?
01:30:31.833,01:30:32.833,-No. -Could be the truth.
01:30:32.916,01:30:35.125,-Could be is not good enough. -What if Rick could help us?
01:30:35.208,01:30:36.833,And what if Rick is one of them?
01:30:37.416,01:30:38.625,Huh?
01:30:38.708,01:30:40.291,"Wait, he knew about the birds."
01:30:40.958,01:30:43.708,"Oh, my God. Gary knew about the birds and he put them in the freezer."
01:30:43.791,01:30:46.000,I cannot believe you're actually thinking about this.
01:30:46.083,01:30:47.958,Every house has run out of food. We have to move.
01:30:48.041,01:30:51.208,You really don't think I know that? You don't think I know that?
01:30:56.750,01:30:59.125,"When I was little, we had a boat just like this."
01:30:59.708,01:31:01.958,"And every single summer, we would take it to the lake."
01:31:02.041,01:31:03.000,Every summer.
01:31:03.583,01:31:07.000,You guys would have loved it up there. They had trees. They had flowers.
01:31:07.583,01:31:10.458,"The water was warm, the clouds were in the sky."
01:31:11.291,01:31:14.125,"We'd all play in the water. All the kids, all the children."
01:31:14.208,01:31:16.208,We would all just run up and down the shore.
01:31:16.291,01:31:18.250,There were other children in the world?
01:31:19.000,01:31:21.500,"Yeah, just like you. Just like you."
01:31:27.000,01:31:28.541,It was bigger than this house.
01:31:28.625,01:31:31.083,"It was so big and old, I couldn't see the top of it."
01:31:31.166,01:31:32.583,-Guess what we did? -Climbed it.
01:31:32.666,01:31:34.291,"We climbed it. Yes, we climbed it."
01:31:34.375,01:31:36.750,We climbed it and climbed it until we got to the top.
01:31:37.708,01:31:39.291,Guess what we saw when we got to the top?
01:31:39.375,01:31:40.875,Boy! Girl! Time for bed.
01:31:40.958,01:31:42.500,But Tom's telling a story.
01:31:42.583,01:31:45.958,"-Mal, let me just-- We're almost done. -I'm not gonna say it again. Come on."
01:31:48.583,01:31:49.541,"Girl, come on."
01:31:50.958,01:31:52.083,Right now.
01:31:52.166,01:31:53.125,Come on.
01:31:53.958,01:31:55.416,Right now.
01:31:56.375,01:31:57.250,Bed!
01:32:02.875,01:32:08.041,Now they think they're gonna go outside and climb trees with all these new kids -and see butterflies and flowers! -It's a story.
01:32:08.125,01:32:10.083,It's not a story. It's a lie.
01:32:10.166,01:32:13.000,"Because they'll never climb trees, they are never gonna make new friends."
01:32:13.083,01:32:15.791,-Why make them believe that? -They have to believe in something.
01:32:15.875,01:32:18.166,What is this for if they don't have anything to believe in?
01:32:18.250,01:32:20.416,-So that they survive! -Surviving is not living.
01:32:20.500,01:32:22.916,They're gonna die if they listen to you!
01:32:25.166,01:32:28.416,Life is more than just what is. It's what could be. What you could make it.
01:32:28.500,01:32:31.375,You need to promise them dreams that may never come true.
01:32:31.458,01:32:34.791,You need to love them knowing that you may lose them at any second.
01:32:34.875,01:32:38.375,They deserve dreams. They deserve love. They deserve hope. They deserve a mother.
01:32:39.500,01:32:41.375,They deserve a mother.
01:32:41.875,01:32:44.875,"You haven't given them names, Mal. Their names are Boy and Girl!"
01:32:44.958,01:32:45.791,Think about that.
01:32:45.875,01:32:48.375,Every single decision I have made has been for them.
01:32:48.458,01:32:50.625,Every single one.
01:33:10.625,01:33:12.000,You know what I saw?
01:33:14.291,01:33:15.916,At the top of the tree?
01:33:17.500,01:33:19.041,I saw a nest.
01:33:21.625,01:33:22.958,With five birds.
01:33:23.958,01:33:26.000,Sitting on the top branch.
01:33:30.833,01:33:32.375,And then they just flew away.
01:35:05.041,01:35:06.000,Wow.
01:35:06.083,01:35:07.583,"No, you did not."
01:35:08.750,01:35:11.375,-They're probably stale. -Yeah.
01:35:12.333,01:35:13.416,Come here.
01:35:14.666,01:35:15.916,Just how I like 'em.
01:35:17.083,01:35:18.083,I'm sorry.
01:35:20.416,01:35:22.250,-Sorry. -Me too.
01:35:25.041,01:35:25.958,Come here.
01:35:49.583,01:35:51.625,This is what strawberry tastes like.
01:36:07.583,01:36:09.333,-What's that? -Quiet.
01:36:14.666,01:36:15.708,Shh.
01:36:23.583,01:36:26.458,"If I'm not home in 15 minutes, you take the kids to the boat and you go."
01:36:26.541,01:36:28.125,-I'm not leaving you! -Mal.
01:36:28.208,01:36:30.375,"-No, I'm not leaving you. -Listen to me."
01:36:31.333,01:36:32.833,I love you so much.
01:36:34.625,01:36:36.291,I love you. Go.
01:36:36.375,01:36:38.250,-No! -Go. Please go.
01:36:38.958,01:36:40.083,Be good. Go.
01:36:40.625,01:36:41.458,Go!
01:36:49.458,01:36:50.708,"I don't think so, friend."
01:36:50.791,01:36:52.125,We can help you though.
01:36:54.291,01:36:56.416,-Take off your blindfold. -Stand back.
01:36:56.500,01:36:58.458,-Stand back! -She's not moving.
01:37:03.708,01:37:05.541,Hey. Got a woman and two kids over here.
01:37:19.708,01:37:20.916,They're coming.
01:37:22.000,01:37:23.250,They won't hurt you.
01:37:23.333,01:37:25.041,Fuck it. Fuck it.
01:37:26.208,01:37:27.416,On the contrary...
01:37:29.041,01:37:31.041,"it's a beautiful thing, friend."
01:39:56.916,01:39:59.708,We are going on the trip now. It's going to be rough.
01:39:59.791,01:40:04.458,You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
01:40:04.541,01:40:05.708,Understand?
01:40:09.166,01:40:10.291,He's not coming.
01:40:28.083,01:40:30.750,It's time. It's time. It's time.
01:40:44.458,01:40:45.625,You remember the rapids?
01:40:46.708,01:40:48.708,Remember I told you about the rapids?
01:40:50.250,01:40:51.208,"Well, they're close."
01:40:51.291,01:40:56.541,It is very dangerous and there's only one way for me to navigate through them.
01:40:57.541,01:40:58.625,Somebody has to look.
01:40:59.208,01:41:01.583,-I'll look. -No. I will decide! Okay? I will decide.
01:41:01.666,01:41:03.541,Just give me-- Just give me a second.
01:41:11.375,01:41:12.250,I'll do it.
01:41:41.916,01:41:43.500,I love you so much.
01:41:53.500,01:41:54.625,Nobody's looking.
01:41:56.000,01:41:57.041,"Okay, nobody's looking."
01:41:58.250,01:41:59.250,Okay?
01:42:09.791,01:42:11.333,Do your eyes. Let's do eyes.
01:42:21.000,01:42:22.666,Don't move. Hold tight.
01:42:42.875,01:42:44.208,Hold on!
01:42:49.625,01:42:51.166,Please hold on. Hold on!
01:42:59.916,01:43:01.083,Ah!
01:43:44.666,01:43:45.833,Girl! Boy!
01:43:49.916,01:43:51.250,Girl! Boy! Boy?
01:43:52.708,01:43:53.916,Girl!
01:43:59.208,01:44:00.208,Boy!
01:44:04.791,01:44:05.833,Malorie!
01:44:05.916,01:44:07.833,-I'm right here. -Malorie!
01:44:07.916,01:44:09.791,-I'm coming. Where are you? -Malorie.
01:44:30.291,01:44:31.750,"Keep ringing, Girl."
01:44:32.333,01:44:34.958,Keep ringing. Keep ringing.
01:44:36.791,01:44:38.208,Good girl.
01:44:39.708,01:44:42.750,Okay. Good job. Get up. Stand up.
01:44:48.666,01:44:51.000,Good girl. Okay. Do you guys hear those birds?
01:44:51.583,01:44:53.875,That's where we're headed. We just follow that sound.
01:45:29.291,01:45:31.333,"Dumb-dumb. Hey, dumb-dumb."
01:45:32.291,01:45:35.250,"Open your eyes, Malorie. Dummy. I'm right here."
01:45:36.500,01:45:37.916,"No, no, no, no, no."
01:45:38.000,01:45:39.375,"No, you're not."
01:45:39.458,01:45:41.375,"No, no, no. No, no, no."
01:45:47.250,01:45:50.083,"Look at me. Malorie, look at me."
01:45:50.166,01:45:53.041,"-Malorie, look at me. -It's not real. It's not real."
01:46:17.875,01:46:18.791,Malorie?
01:46:34.375,01:46:35.708,"Look at me, Malorie."
01:46:38.041,01:46:40.666,Don't move. Stay right where you are!
01:46:44.666,01:46:46.625,"Malorie, open your eyes."
01:46:56.166,01:46:58.791,Boy. Girl. Where are you?
01:47:08.625,01:47:10.916,I need you. Just look at me.
01:47:11.000,01:47:13.000,Can I really take off my blindfold?
01:47:17.875,01:47:20.500,"No, no, no. Keep your blindfold on."
01:47:20.583,01:47:22.000,"Boy, that's not real."
01:47:22.083,01:47:24.458,Keep your blindfold on. Listen to me.
01:47:24.541,01:47:26.416,Listen to my voice! This is my voice!
01:47:39.083,01:47:40.666,"Girl, come with me. Look at me."
01:47:41.750,01:47:43.750,Take the blindfold off. You can look at me.
01:47:43.833,01:47:45.708,Isn't it dangerous if I look?
01:47:46.625,01:47:50.250,"No. No, I'm right here. I'm right here! Do not take off your blindfold!"
01:47:50.333,01:47:51.541,Please listen to me!
01:47:53.000,01:47:55.208,"-Please open your eyes. -No. Girl, call out to me."
01:47:55.291,01:47:59.166,"-It's just beautiful. -Call out to me, please. Where are you?"
01:47:59.791,01:48:02.708,Boy. Girl. Where are you? Don't take my children.
01:48:02.791,01:48:04.375,Do not take my children!
01:48:09.833,01:48:12.416,"Keep ringing, baby. I'm coming. Keep ringing."
01:48:12.500,01:48:14.958,"Come on, keep ringing. Keep ringing."
01:48:15.041,01:48:16.875,"Oh, my God. I've got you."
01:48:17.458,01:48:21.416,I've got you. We're good. Where's Girl? Where's Girl? Where's Girl?
01:48:21.500,01:48:23.666,Girl. Girl! Girl!
01:48:27.333,01:48:28.500,What?
01:48:28.583,01:48:30.041,She's scared of you.
01:48:32.375,01:48:33.375,It's okay.
01:48:33.458,01:48:34.291,Uh...
01:48:35.458,01:48:37.250,"Oh, I'm so sorry."
01:48:38.250,01:48:40.625,"I'm so sorry, sweet girl. I'm so sorry."
01:48:41.666,01:48:44.125,I was wrong. I shouldn't have been so harsh.
01:48:45.166,01:48:47.291,I shouldn't have stopped you from playing.
01:48:47.833,01:48:54.166,I shouldn't have ended Tom's story because it wasn't finished.
01:48:54.250,01:49:01.541,"When he climbed to the very top of that giant oak tree, he saw the most beautiful things."
01:49:01.625,01:49:05.125,He saw hundreds of children playing games.
01:49:05.208,01:49:06.291,Hundreds.
01:49:06.791,01:49:08.500,And he saw birds...
01:49:09.458,01:49:14.041,"all different colored birds, and... and he saw us."
01:49:14.625,01:49:16.958,He saw us from the very top.
01:49:17.041,01:49:19.666,"He saw us together, and we have to be together."
01:49:20.375,01:49:22.375,And it's not just a story.
01:49:22.458,01:49:26.458,"It's not, because I have so much I want to show you."
01:49:27.041,01:49:30.708,I have so much I want you to see. Okay?
01:49:30.791,01:49:32.958,"But we have to do it together, okay?"
01:49:33.041,01:49:36.833,"So I just need you to come to me right now, okay? Please?"
01:49:37.333,01:49:38.375,Just come to me.
01:49:38.458,01:49:40.375,"Baby, come to me, okay?"
01:49:40.458,01:49:41.833,Oh! Ah.
01:49:52.416,01:49:55.625,I love you so much. I love you so much. I love you so much.
01:49:55.708,01:49:57.416,I love you so much.
01:49:57.500,01:50:00.458,"We need to find the birds, okay? Find the birds."
