00:01:48.125,00:01:49.875,Happy...
00:01:49.917,00:01:52.125,Thanksgiving!
00:01:53.667,00:01:55.041,Get 'em here.
00:01:56.917,00:01:58.792,"Bumpy, let me get one!"
00:01:58.834,00:02:00.709,Here!
00:02:00.750,00:02:02.333,"I need a bird, Bumpy!"
00:02:05.208,00:02:08.000,- Bumpy!
00:02:14.834,00:02:17.792,"Frank, come."
00:02:31.041,00:02:33.625,This is the problem.
00:02:33.667,00:02:36.375,This is what's wrong with America.
00:02:36.417,00:02:40.375,"It's gotten so big, you just can't find your way."
00:02:40.417,00:02:44.875,The grocery store on the corner is now a supermarket.
00:02:44.917,00:02:47.792,The candy store is McDonald's.
00:02:49.458,00:02:53.458,And this place-- a super-fuckin' discount store.
00:02:53.500,00:02:55.500,Where's the pride of ownership?
00:02:55.542,00:02:57.834,Huh?
00:02:57.875,00:02:59.625,Where's the personal service?
00:03:03.375,00:03:04.750,Thanks.
00:03:06.083,00:03:09.667,You see what I mean?
00:03:11.208,00:03:14.041,"I mean, what right do they have..."
00:03:14.083,00:03:16.166,of cutting out the suppliers?
00:03:16.208,00:03:20.291,Pushing out all the middlemen.
00:03:20.333,00:03:23.834,Buying direct from the manufacturer.
00:03:23.875,00:03:28.458,"Sony this, Toshiba that."
00:03:28.500,00:03:32.917,All them Chinks putting Americans out of work.
00:03:32.959,00:03:41.083,"He had plans to take place-- Uh, from Laos-- That's the way it is now."
00:03:44.583,00:03:47.333,You all right?
00:03:47.375,00:03:49.667,You can't find the heart of anything...
00:03:51.542,00:03:53.208,to stick the knife.
00:03:55.667,00:03:58.625,Hey! Anybody here?
00:04:00.041,00:04:02.375,Can I help you?
00:04:02.417,00:04:03.583,"Forget it, Frank."
00:04:05.792,00:04:07.792,There's no one in charge.
00:04:12.500,00:04:15.250,Call an ambulance!
00:04:15.291,00:04:18.667,Some say Bumpy Johnson was a great man.
00:04:18.709,00:04:22.000,"According to eulogies, a giving man, a man of the people."
00:04:22.041,00:04:24.125,No one chose to use in their remembrances...
00:04:24.166,00:04:31.750,the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson-- gangster-- whose passing has brought a who's who of mourners on this chilly afternoon.
00:04:31.792,00:04:37.083,"The K.C. mob boss Dominic Cattano, Harlem crime figure Nicky Barnes."
00:04:37.125,00:04:40.083,"From the political arena, the governor's come down."
00:04:40.125,00:04:45.333,"The mayor of New York, the chief of police and commissioner, sports and entertainment luminaries."
00:04:45.375,00:04:52.375,"Bumpy Johnson, age 62 when he passed, was a folk hero among Harlem locals for over four decades."
00:04:52.417,00:04:57.125,"Regarded by some as the Robin Hood of Harlem, by others as a ruthless criminal."
00:04:57.166,00:04:58.875,I don't understand it.
00:05:00.709,00:05:01.709,I would have thought that Bumpy would've put out a better spread than that.
00:05:03.083,00:05:05.375,Want something?
00:05:05.417,00:05:07.625,I want chicken wings at my funeral.
00:05:07.667,00:05:11.291,Who is that?
00:05:11.333,00:05:13.625,"I just kept poppin' him in the face, 'cause that's how I do."
00:05:15.542,00:05:16.875,Mm.
00:05:20.333,00:05:22.041,Don't have a light.
00:05:22.083,00:05:26.041,Oh. Mm. Oh.
00:05:29.625,00:05:30.625,Mm.
00:05:33.125,00:05:36.667,Okay.
00:05:36.709,00:05:38.041,"Hey, Frank."
00:05:40.208,00:05:41.583,Go get me a light while you're at it.
00:05:44.333,00:05:45.709,Appreciate it.
00:05:46.542,00:05:48.667,Don Cattano.
00:05:48.709,00:05:52.166,"Hey. How you doing, Rossi?"
00:05:52.208,00:05:54.917,"Would you like a drink, sir?"
00:06:00.458,00:06:02.041,Come on.
00:06:02.083,00:06:03.417,Come on.
00:06:11.458,00:06:14.000,"Uh, I know you're hurting, Frank."
00:06:14.625,00:06:16.333,So am I.
00:06:16.375,00:06:18.542,I'm all right.
00:06:18.583,00:06:21.375,You gonna be all right?
00:06:21.417,00:06:25.709,"I'm sure Bumpy didn't say anything to you, but he made me promise that if anything ever happened to him..."
00:06:25.750,00:06:28.917,that I should make sure that you want for nothing.
00:06:30.458,00:06:32.166,I appreciate that.
00:06:32.208,00:06:36.625,Half the people in this room owed Bumpy money when he died.
00:06:36.667,00:06:40.166,"They think I'm gonna forget to collect, but I'm gonna get that money."
00:06:40.208,00:06:42.875,"Well, that's the spirit."
00:06:46.166,00:06:48.375,Mr. Roberts.
00:06:48.417,00:06:51.750,"Taking the prosecution's side, give us U.S. v. Meade."
00:06:51.792,00:06:54.375,"Subject, issues, what the determination was..."
00:06:54.417,00:06:57.250,and what it means to us today.
00:06:57.291,00:07:01.083,"Class, you'll be critiquing Mr. Roberts, so pay attention."
00:07:04.166,00:07:06.166,I hate hearing my name called.
00:07:06.208,00:07:08.000,I gotta get up in front of the class.
00:07:08.041,00:07:09.959,I got to turn around.
00:07:10.000,00:07:13.709,"And I know every one of those people there, they know more than I do."
00:07:13.750,00:07:16.542,The number-one fear of people-- It ain't dying.
00:07:16.583,00:07:19.333,It's public speaking.
00:07:19.375,00:07:21.250,And that's what you wanna do for a living.
00:07:21.291,00:07:23.333,"Hell, I don't wanna be like that, man."
00:07:23.375,00:07:25.417,So should I do this?
00:07:25.458,00:07:27.000,He knows me.
00:07:27.041,00:07:29.208,From high school?
00:07:29.250,00:07:31.709,"Here. If he doesn't take it, just throw it in."
00:07:31.750,00:07:33.417,Throw it in?
00:07:33.458,00:07:35.083,All right.
00:07:35.125,00:07:37.000,"What's up, Susie?"
00:07:37.041,00:07:39.250,"How you doin', baby?"
00:07:39.291,00:07:41.125,All right.
00:08:05.750,00:08:10.458,You... are... supposed to...
00:08:12.208,00:08:14.417,"I swear to God, Richie."
00:08:14.458,00:08:17.542,I would never slam a door on your hand knowingly.
00:08:17.583,00:08:19.041,You bit my fuckin' hand.
00:08:19.083,00:08:20.625,What are you doin' servin' subpoenas anyway?
00:08:20.667,00:08:23.041,We're on loan to county.
00:08:23.083,00:08:25.375,How's that workin' out for you?
00:08:25.417,00:08:27.375,"Hey, I'm sorry."
00:08:27.417,00:08:29.750,Can we-- Can we-- Can we leave it there?
00:08:29.792,00:08:32.375,Assault on a police officer?
00:08:32.417,00:08:34.667,"Hey, for old times' sake."
00:08:34.709,00:08:36.417,What do you want?
00:08:36.458,00:08:38.417,"What do you get for assault with a deadly weapon, Jay?"
00:08:38.458,00:08:40.750,- Five years minimum.
00:08:40.792,00:08:44.458,"No, guys. Come on, no."
00:08:44.500,00:08:47.792,- Who do you got?
00:08:47.834,00:08:50.375,You want his accountant?
00:08:59.458,00:09:02.250,"No, stop, stop, stop. Stop."
00:09:02.291,00:09:04.000,There he is.
00:09:06.083,00:09:08.291,That's him.
00:09:08.333,00:09:10.250,"All right, Carlo, get lost."
00:09:10.291,00:09:12.500,"What, right here? This is-- Yeah, right here."
00:09:12.542,00:09:13.834,I'd rather not.
00:09:13.875,00:09:15.125,Let's go.
00:09:15.709,00:09:17.125,Take it ease.
00:09:37.375,00:09:40.208,We gonna stay with him or the car?
00:09:40.250,00:09:42.125,"Well, let's see who comes for the car."
00:09:56.542,00:09:58.667,Think he made us?
00:09:58.709,00:10:01.208,"You called in the warrants, right?"
00:10:01.250,00:10:03.208,"I just called, man."
00:10:03.250,00:10:06.250,"I called and walked back here, and 10 seconds has gone by."
00:10:09.125,00:10:10.917,"I saw him with the slips, Jay."
00:10:10.959,00:10:13.667,You saw policy slips?
00:10:13.709,00:10:16.375,You don't know what's in 'em.
00:10:16.417,00:10:18.959,Don't give me that bull.
00:10:19.000,00:10:21.125,"Half an hour, the warrant'll be here."
00:10:21.166,00:10:22.583,Guess you're gonna miss it.
00:10:27.208,00:10:28.709,Ahh.
00:10:31.583,00:10:33.792,Fuck this. Come on.
00:10:33.834,00:10:36.083,Yeah. I'm sure.
00:11:28.583,00:11:30.208,Fuck.
00:11:31.709,00:11:33.500,Jay.
00:11:39.458,00:11:41.083,Fuck.
00:11:45.333,00:11:47.250,"WBZ, honey bunch."
00:11:47.291,00:11:50.000,And love is the groovy sound of the Jefferson Kaye Saturday night show.
00:11:50.041,00:11:52.083,"Dig, honey."
00:11:52.125,00:11:55.291,Jumpin' up and seein' the wallpaper peelin' on WBZ.
00:11:55.333,00:11:57.500,Stick around.
00:12:05.333,00:12:06.959,"It's not just a couple of bucks, all right?"
00:12:07.000,00:12:08.083,"It's the same thing, in principle."
00:12:09.542,00:12:11.250,"Oh, what, we talkin' principles?"
00:12:11.291,00:12:14.917,"Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing."
00:12:14.959,00:12:16.583,He turns in cops who take money.
00:12:16.625,00:12:18.291,We'll be fuckin' pariahs.
00:12:18.333,00:12:20.792,"- Yeah, well, then we're fucked both ways."
00:12:20.834,00:12:22.667,"Only if we don't, then you're right."
00:12:22.709,00:12:24.041,But not if we keep it.
00:12:25.625,00:12:28.125,"Goddamn it, man."
00:12:28.166,00:12:31.000,"Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, Give us your money?"
00:12:31.041,00:12:35.083,Cops kill cops they can't trust.
00:12:37.917,00:12:39.750,"We can't turn it in, man."
00:12:49.667,00:12:51.125,Do you believe that?
00:13:00.375,00:13:02.500,How much is it?
00:13:02.542,00:13:05.125,"$987,000."
00:13:07.250,00:13:10.166,"Well, what happened to the rest of it?"
00:13:12.083,00:13:15.500,What the hell are you doing counting it in front of everybody? You nuts?
00:13:17.291,00:13:19.917,"Get it in the bags, seal 'em and down to the property room."
00:13:30.917,00:13:32.542,You fuckin' boy scout.
00:13:56.417,00:13:58.583,What?
00:13:58.625,00:13:59.959,What?
00:14:23.750,00:14:25.041,"Detective Trupo, sign here."
00:14:30.250,00:14:32.458,You guys ready to make a lot of fuckin' money?
00:14:32.500,00:14:34.333,"Hell, yeah."
00:14:37.041,00:14:38.834,Look at this.
00:14:38.875,00:14:40.750,There you go. All right.
00:14:40.792,00:14:42.792,Look at this.
00:14:42.834,00:14:44.875,There's three more votes.
00:14:52.625,00:14:55.458,- Hey. Don't lose any of that shit.
00:14:55.500,00:14:56.834,All right? Be careful.
00:14:59.542,00:15:02.250,Hey.
00:15:04.250,00:15:05.709,A little less.
00:15:11.834,00:15:14.166,That's just the French Connection dope.
00:15:14.208,00:15:18.458,Kilos of the same dope Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso took from us.
00:15:18.500,00:15:26.917,"The cops seize it, arrest everyone, and they start taking it out of the evidence room, whacking it down to nothing and selling it back to us."
00:15:26.959,00:15:29.417,They basically control the market with it.
00:15:29.458,00:15:31.792,"Well, Mr. Rossi, I have a surprise for you."
00:15:31.834,00:15:33.375,They've been doing this for years.
00:15:33.417,00:15:36.458,They live off it-- our dope.
00:15:36.500,00:15:38.500,"What the fuck is happening to the world, Frank?"
00:15:38.542,00:15:40.875,Fuckin' crooks.
00:15:40.917,00:15:43.000,Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.
00:15:45.333,00:15:47.375,Things are never gonna be the same in Harlem.
00:15:47.417,00:15:50.291,"You walk down the street, nobody bothers you..."
00:15:50.333,00:15:52.750,'cause Bumpy was making sure of it.
00:15:52.792,00:15:54.000,Half a key.
00:15:54.041,00:15:56.166,How is your day now?
00:15:57.208,00:15:59.291,It's chaos.
00:16:06.792,00:16:08.667,Who can live like that?
00:16:08.709,00:16:12.750,There has to be order.
00:16:12.792,00:16:16.166,More important than any one man's life is order.
00:16:24.458,00:16:26.166,Frank.
00:16:26.208,00:16:29.583,Hey.
00:16:34.875,00:16:36.333,"How y'all doin', huh?"
00:16:36.375,00:16:38.125,"So, you seen Nate over there?"
00:16:38.166,00:16:39.583,"Yeah, all the time."
00:16:39.625,00:16:41.125,Nate is everywhere.
00:16:41.166,00:16:42.458,It's good.
00:16:42.500,00:16:44.500,Yeah. Got him-- Got himself a club now.
00:16:44.542,00:16:45.959,Whereabouts?
00:16:46.000,00:16:47.959,Bangkok.
00:16:48.000,00:16:50.125,I don't think he's ever comin' home.
00:16:53.667,00:16:55.041,Come on.
00:17:06.250,00:17:09.000,Taste this for me.
00:17:21.625,00:17:24.542,On the house.
00:17:24.583,00:17:28.041,"Thank you, sugar."
00:17:28.083,00:17:30.625,Thank Frank.
00:17:32.333,00:17:34.667,Just relax.
00:17:34.709,00:17:37.041,You're gonna have to boot this shit a couple of times.
00:17:38.917,00:17:42.125,"The cops keep cuttin' it, sellin' the shit."
00:17:44.417,00:17:47.166,I don't wanna say anything 'cause the price is right.
00:17:47.208,00:17:49.458,But that shit in Nam...
00:17:49.500,00:17:55.792,"is way, way heavy."
00:18:19.125,00:18:21.792,"What, you ain't see the jar, Frank?"
00:18:21.834,00:18:24.917,Hmm?
00:18:24.959,00:18:29.125,"The money jar, Frank."
00:18:29.166,00:18:30.500,Hmm?
00:18:32.417,00:18:35.041,Look at this nigga right here.
00:18:35.083,00:18:38.500,"You know, Frank, Bumpy don't own 116th no more."
00:18:38.542,00:18:40.333,Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem right now.
00:18:40.375,00:18:42.792,"I'm the landlord, and the lease is 20%."
00:18:44.542,00:18:47.250,"Well, look, don't-- Don't sell dope then, Frank."
00:18:47.291,00:18:49.583,Get a real job.
00:18:49.625,00:18:52.750,Hmm? That what you need?
00:18:52.792,00:18:56.208,Okay?
00:18:56.250,00:18:58.250,"Yes, sir. No, sir."
00:18:58.291,00:19:00.208,"Uh, anything you want, Massa Johnson."
00:19:03.166,00:19:04.959,Twenty percent.
00:19:12.125,00:19:14.417,"Twenty percent is my profit, Tango."
00:19:16.291,00:19:19.166,"If I give you that, what do I got left?"
00:19:19.208,00:19:22.125,Twenty percent puts me out of business and every somebody you know out of business.
00:19:22.166,00:19:25.792,"There's legitimate ways of doin' things, Tango, and then there's this way."
00:19:25.834,00:19:28.333,Not even Bumpy took 20%.
00:19:28.375,00:19:29.792,Bumpy's fuckin' dead.
00:19:33.125,00:19:34.583,My man.
00:19:34.625,00:19:36.375,Twenty percent?
00:19:44.792,00:19:46.500,Twenty percent.
00:19:46.542,00:19:48.375,Doc. Let's go.
00:19:51.375,00:19:54.917,The drug problem in Vietnam is more than marijuana.
00:19:54.959,00:19:58.625,"At this point, it is estimated that one-third of American troops..."
00:19:58.667,00:20:01.542,are experimenting with opium and heroin.
00:20:01.583,00:20:04.417,The authorities say they've confiscated...
00:20:04.458,00:20:08.291,"large quantities of marijuana, heroin and pills."
00:20:08.333,00:20:11.000,Every person and every vehicle going through the gates...
00:20:11.041,00:20:13.542,is subject to a thorough shakedown.
00:20:13.583,00:20:15.208,Soldiers have access to the drugs...
00:20:15.250,00:20:17.500,at many rest and relaxation spots...
00:20:17.542,00:20:21.625,"in Bangkok, Saigon and other areas throughout Vietnam and Thailand."
00:20:21.667,00:20:25.792,"Officials say the easy availability, relatively cheap cost..."
00:20:25.834,00:20:29.458,and high purity of heroin throughout Saigon and the Far East...
00:20:29.500,00:20:33.291,is leading to an epidemic of heroin addiction among U.S. soldiers.
00:20:37.333,00:20:39.166,Operator.
00:20:39.208,00:20:41.667,What city?
00:20:41.709,00:20:45.041,- You know the country code?
00:20:45.083,00:20:47.959,"- For the first three minutes, it'll be-- - All right, I got it. I got it."
00:20:53.000,00:20:54.875,Hello?
00:20:54.917,00:20:56.625,Soul Brothers.
00:20:56.667,00:20:58.333,Nate.
00:20:58.375,00:21:00.417,Do I know you?
00:21:00.458,00:21:02.917,Who?
00:21:07.125,00:21:08.458,Go on and get yourself a new suit.
00:21:46.417,00:21:49.250,"Look, I'm sorry."
00:21:49.291,00:21:52.542,It couldn't be avoided.
00:21:52.583,00:21:54.667,We're moving.
00:21:54.709,00:21:56.667,What?
00:21:57.917,00:21:59.291,The St. Regis.
00:22:02.542,00:22:04.250,My sister's.
00:22:04.291,00:22:06.542,Your sister's?
00:22:06.583,00:22:08.709,Yeah.
00:22:08.750,00:22:10.291,Not with Michael anyway.
00:22:10.333,00:22:12.125,What am I supposed to do with him?
00:22:12.166,00:22:14.417,Leave him with you?
00:22:14.458,00:22:16.959,"Hey, guys, be cool."
00:22:19.959,00:22:23.375,"Laurie, Las Vegas is not the kind of place that you raise a kid."
00:22:23.417,00:22:24.875,"Oh, like-- like this is a good environment?"
00:22:24.917,00:22:26.667,And around your friends?
00:22:26.709,00:22:28.458,When am I supposed to see my boy?
00:22:28.500,00:22:30.625,This weekend.
00:22:30.667,00:22:33.166,Goddamn it.
00:22:33.208,00:22:36.834,"- Hey! I asked you nice to shut up, right?"
00:22:36.875,00:22:38.959,Now I'm gonna have to kill you.
00:22:39.000,00:22:41.417,I swear I will pull out my gun and put a bullet in your fuckin' head!
00:22:41.458,00:22:44.834,"Now, stop what you're doin' and pick up the glass!"
00:22:48.625,00:22:50.000,"Fuckin' crazy, man."
00:22:51.000,00:22:52.375,You don't have a gun.
00:22:55.375,00:22:56.750,You sure?
00:23:05.125,00:23:07.125,"You are crazy, Richie."
00:23:11.333,00:23:13.125,You don't have room for us.
00:23:15.250,00:23:17.625,I'll see you in court.
00:23:17.667,00:23:19.333,"Come on, Michael!"
00:23:19.375,00:23:22.041,Say good-bye to your dad.
00:23:23.583,00:23:25.625,Get over here.
00:23:27.375,00:23:30.166,"See you next week, all right?"
00:23:31.250,00:23:33.000,Let's get you an ice cream.
00:23:58.083,00:23:59.834,You have 10 minutes remaining.
00:24:01.083,00:24:02.583,Ten minutes.
00:24:57.041,00:25:00.000,Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
00:25:06.709,00:25:08.667,Whoo!
00:25:08.709,00:25:11.667,"Shake it, baby!"
00:25:15.875,00:25:18.291,"Aw, come on, girl."
00:25:18.333,00:25:21.792,Can you dig that it costs money to be here?
00:25:21.834,00:25:24.792,"Aw, come on, girl."
00:25:56.500,00:25:57.875,"How much you want, Frank?"
00:25:59.542,00:26:01.792,Tell him I want a hundred keys.
00:26:04.208,00:26:06.792,"Frank, ain't nobody I know can get you that much personally, all right?"
00:26:06.834,00:26:08.375,You're gonna have to piece it together from several sources.
00:26:08.417,00:26:10.166,And it's not gonna be a hundred percent pure.
00:26:10.208,00:26:12.583,Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
00:26:12.625,00:26:14.542,"I know what you don't want, Frank."
00:26:14.583,00:26:19.166,"But, look. What you gonna need is to get to the Chiu Chou syndicate, all right?"
00:26:19.208,00:26:20.542,You ain't hearin' me.
00:26:22.000,00:26:23.000,If they're gonna deal with you at all.
00:26:24.625,00:26:25.709,But by then it's gonna be too late.
00:26:27.458,00:26:28.458,I wanna go get it where they go get it from.
00:26:29.583,00:26:30.959,So you're gonna get it yourself?
00:26:31.000,00:26:34.250,Huh?
00:26:34.291,00:26:37.291,You gonna go into the motherfuckin' jungle?
00:26:37.333,00:26:39.667,They eatin' these roaches and... whatever that is.
00:26:39.709,00:26:42.291,"Nigga, I'm talkin' about snakes, all right?"
00:26:42.333,00:26:45.458,I'm talkin' about Vietcong.
00:26:47.834,00:26:49.583,You wanna go into the jungle?
00:26:52.208,00:26:54.083,- Fuck it. Let's go.
00:26:54.125,00:26:55.208,Why not?
00:27:38.208,00:27:40.583,"Hey, Frank."
00:27:40.625,00:27:43.333,This whole spot's locked down by the Kuomintang.
00:27:45.166,00:27:47.417,General Chiang Kai-shek's defeated army.
00:28:26.250,00:28:28.542,How would you get it into the States?
00:28:28.583,00:28:31.125,You ain't got to worry about that.
00:28:31.166,00:28:34.250,Who do you work for in there?
00:28:34.291,00:28:35.667,Who are you really?
00:28:37.208,00:28:39.041,Frank Lucas.
00:28:39.083,00:28:42.125,"I mean, who you represent?"
00:28:44.583,00:28:48.000,You think you're going to take a hundred kilos of heroin into the U.S....
00:28:48.041,00:28:49.834,and you don't work for anyone?
00:28:49.875,00:28:51.583,Someone is going to allow that?
00:28:51.625,00:28:53.500,That's right.
00:29:00.625,00:29:06.834,"After this first purchase, if you are not killed by Marseilles importers..."
00:29:06.875,00:29:12.333,"or their people in the States, then, uh, what?"
00:29:12.375,00:29:16.166,"Then there'll be more, much more. I guarantee it."
00:29:16.208,00:29:19.083,"And if it's all the same to you, I don't wanna have to drag my ass up here no more."
00:29:20.750,00:29:22.083,Of course not.
00:29:24.917,00:29:26.083,My man.
00:29:27.417,00:29:30.166,"Soul brother, huh?"
00:30:11.667,00:30:13.500,Fifty grand.
00:30:13.542,00:30:16.000,and the pilot and the boys on the other end.
00:30:16.041,00:30:18.959,Give 'em a hundred.
00:30:19.000,00:30:20.959,"Fifty gonna cover it, Frank."
00:30:21.000,00:30:24.166,Give 'em a hundred.
00:30:24.208,00:30:27.667,"And, look."
00:30:27.709,00:30:35.625,"So if that dope don't arrive for any reason-- Hey, listen."
00:30:35.667,00:30:38.375,"Cousin or no cousin, I'm a busy man, all right?"
00:30:38.417,00:30:40.542,I ain't got no time to be goin' to nobody's funeral.
00:30:42.041,00:30:43.792,I'll let you know when it's in the air.
00:30:44.625,00:30:45.709,My man.
00:31:09.375,00:31:11.083,Richie?
00:31:11.125,00:31:14.208,This fuckin' guy made me.
00:31:14.250,00:31:16.125,He went for his gun.
00:31:16.166,00:31:17.834,"I had to do it, man."
00:31:17.875,00:31:20.166,There's a hundred people out there heard the shots.
00:31:20.208,00:31:21.667,You gotta help me.
00:31:23.208,00:31:25.333,"Where are you, Jay?"
00:31:25.375,00:31:28.000,That's the problem.
00:31:31.000,00:31:34.834,"Dispatch, I got a 1013."
00:31:34.875,00:31:36.875,Copy that. What's your 20?
00:31:36.917,00:31:38.250,It's tower two.
00:31:40.125,00:31:41.125,Apartment 1-G.
00:31:42.667,00:31:44.834,"Kent and West, in the projects."
00:31:44.875,00:31:46.291,"Identify yourself, please."
00:31:46.333,00:31:48.083,Detective Richie Roberts.
00:31:48.125,00:31:50.125,That's a negative.
00:31:50.166,00:31:51.583,Bullshit.
00:31:51.625,00:31:54.834,Please put the call out again.
00:31:54.875,00:31:56.959,"Detective Roberts, I got no units in that area."
00:31:57.000,00:31:58.291,Fuck you.
00:32:05.417,00:32:07.458,"happened in there, you fuckin' pig?"
00:32:12.375,00:32:14.667,Fuck that motherfucker!

00:32:21.041,00:32:24.125,What the fuck you doin'?
00:32:25.792,00:32:27.750,"What you gonna do, motherfucker?"
00:32:27.792,00:32:30.834,"Hey, hey. Be cool."
00:32:30.875,00:32:32.291,"Be cool, all right?"
00:32:32.333,00:32:34.458,I'll find out what's going on in here.
00:32:42.125,00:32:44.458,Richie.
00:32:49.250,00:32:51.208,Open this door!
00:32:51.250,00:32:53.500,Open the motherfuckin' door!
00:32:53.542,00:32:55.959,- Where's your backup?
00:32:56.000,00:32:58.208,You got no backup?
00:32:58.250,00:33:00.834,"You gotta come out sometime, motherfucker!"
00:33:01.750,00:33:03.458,Bandage his neck.
00:33:03.500,00:33:06.125,"Richie, he's dead."
00:33:06.166,00:33:10.333,"Bandage his neck, clean up his head, prop him up on the gurney so he's sittin', and open his fuckin' eyes."
00:33:10.375,00:33:11.875,Open this fuckin' door!
00:33:11.917,00:33:13.250,Let's go.
00:33:17.417,00:33:19.834,"All right, clean him up."
00:33:19.875,00:33:21.917,"Okay, where's the solution?"
00:33:24.375,00:33:25.875,Hey.

00:33:31.875,00:33:33.792,What?
00:33:33.834,00:33:36.000,"Get your punk ass out here, man!"
00:33:36.041,00:33:37.458,You have your badge?
00:33:37.500,00:33:39.583,I'm sick of your motherfuckin' games!

00:33:47.917,00:33:49.834,It's okay. It's okay.
00:33:49.875,00:33:51.917,We're gonna take him to the hospital.
00:33:51.959,00:33:55.083,We're gonna take him to the hospital.
00:33:55.125,00:33:57.166,It's all right.
00:33:57.208,00:33:59.834,He's okay.
00:33:59.875,00:34:02.333,Step back.
00:34:02.375,00:34:04.417,Be cool.
00:34:07.250,00:34:10.375,He's alive.
00:34:10.417,00:34:13.625,What happened to Sy?
00:34:21.333,00:34:23.166,"Thanks, man."
00:34:24.417,00:34:27.000,Fuck.
00:34:27.041,00:34:29.333,"That asshole pulled a piece on me, man."
00:34:29.375,00:34:32.125,Pulls a piece on a cop?
00:34:32.166,00:34:34.208,Kill or be killed.
00:34:34.250,00:34:36.375,"Fuckin' crazy world, right?"
00:34:39.250,00:34:41.250,What the fuck were you doin' in the projects?
00:34:41.291,00:34:46.667,"Yeah, investigating stuff, man, you know, just like you taught me."
00:34:46.709,00:34:51.709,"Checkin' on guys, following things up, putting the pieces together."
00:34:51.750,00:34:54.542,"Guy was a dealer, fucking dealer-- scum of the earth."
00:34:56.750,00:34:59.291,"That guy didn't pull a gun on a cop, Jay."
00:34:59.333,00:35:02.333,That guy pulled a gun on a junkie.
00:35:02.375,00:35:04.500,The junkie was trying to rob him.
00:35:06.959,00:35:09.250,"What the fuck, man?"
00:35:09.291,00:35:11.542,The fuck is that?
00:35:11.583,00:35:14.959,I earned this shit!
00:35:15.000,00:35:16.917,What the fuck is that?
00:35:16.959,00:35:18.625,You murdered a guy!
00:35:18.667,00:35:21.083,You murdered a guy!
00:35:21.125,00:35:24.542,"You murdered him. You robbed his money, then called me to get you out of it."
00:35:24.583,00:35:27.041,"That makes me an accessory after the fact, motherfucker."
00:35:27.083,00:35:30.625,I'll tell you the facts.
00:35:30.667,00:35:34.333,A-And then that's the way it is.
00:35:35.500,00:35:36.875,I can't do that.
00:35:38.250,00:35:40.083,I'm a leper because I listened to you...
00:35:40.125,00:35:42.083,and turned in a million bucks.
00:35:42.125,00:35:43.750,No one will work with me after that.
00:35:45.000,00:35:47.333,"I can get off this shit, Richie."
00:35:47.375,00:35:48.792,That's easy.
00:35:48.834,00:35:51.083,Just write the report.
00:35:51.125,00:35:53.625,"Between us, as partners."
00:35:55.625,00:35:57.000,I can't do that.
00:35:59.458,00:36:01.291,Hey!
00:36:02.542,00:36:04.125,Stop!
00:36:04.750,00:36:05.834,Fuck it.
00:36:43.834,00:36:45.500,Open the trunk.
00:37:03.583,00:37:07.250,"LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"
00:37:07.291,00:37:11.125,"Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!"
00:37:11.166,00:37:14.458,"Get out, get out, get out of Vietnam!"
00:37:14.500,00:37:17.625,that the Vietnam War should stop.
00:37:17.667,00:37:19.458,And that the best way to stop it...
00:37:19.500,00:37:22.125,is for the United States to simply pack up...
00:37:22.166,00:37:24.250,and get out of Vietnam right now.
00:37:29.291,00:37:30.750,How we lookin'?
00:37:34.166,00:37:37.875,Typically what I see is 25 to 45% pure.
00:37:37.917,00:37:40.375,"I mean, there's no adulterants, no alkaloids."
00:37:41.750,00:37:43.125,It's a hundred percent.
00:37:48.333,00:37:50.250,May I?
00:37:51.583,00:37:53.291,"Thank you, Frank."
00:38:44.375,00:38:47.083,How about two dimes?
00:39:49.625,00:39:51.083,I'll take it.
00:39:51.125,00:39:54.166,"No contingencies, no loan, no nothin'."
00:39:54.959,00:39:55.959,Cash.
00:39:57.250,00:39:58.250,Fabulous.
00:40:03.166,00:40:07.625,"I'm not talking about your proclivities, Richie."
00:40:07.667,00:40:09.417,I'm talkin' about being a cop.
00:40:09.458,00:40:12.333,You're talkin' about taking money?
00:40:12.375,00:40:14.250,I don't do that.
00:40:14.291,00:40:15.875,"Well, what about your friends from the neighborhood?"
00:40:15.917,00:40:18.166,Do you still hang out with 'em?
00:40:18.208,00:40:22.458,Play baseball on the weekends.
00:40:22.500,00:40:24.625,Guys I went to high school with.
00:40:24.667,00:40:26.000,What about Joseph Sodano?
00:40:27.458,00:40:29.166,What about him?
00:40:29.208,00:40:32.250,"Richie, I'm just trying to understand things your wife has said."
00:40:32.291,00:40:35.417,"They're not true, tell me."
00:40:35.458,00:40:37.375,Is he also your son's godfather?
00:40:37.417,00:40:39.458,He's definitely fucking her.
00:40:39.500,00:40:44.250,"Do you really care about this, or do you just not want her to win ever?"
00:40:47.834,00:40:51.792,"You know, there's an interview room on the second floor."
00:40:51.834,00:40:53.458,That's what I thought.
00:40:53.500,00:40:55.834,All rise.
00:41:02.959,00:41:05.166,"Oh, Richie, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer."
00:41:13.917,00:41:16.709,Mmm. Don't answer it! No.
00:41:22.500,00:41:24.125,Yeah.
00:41:30.291,00:41:31.792,Don't sweat it.
00:41:32.792,00:41:34.792,"Yeah, miss you too."
00:41:37.709,00:41:39.542,Richie Roberts.
00:41:41.834,00:41:43.291,Hey. Richie Roberts.
00:41:43.333,00:41:44.959,Hi. Detective Norman Riley.
00:41:45.000,00:41:47.166,"Hey, Norm."
00:41:47.208,00:41:48.917,"So, is that him?"
00:41:57.333,00:41:58.959,"Picked a nice night to come out, huh?"
00:41:59.000,00:42:00.709,It's like Grand Central around here.
00:42:00.750,00:42:02.625,It's been like this.
00:42:02.667,00:42:04.041,I'm lucky if I get home by midnight.
00:42:05.792,00:42:07.166,It's like nothin' we've seen before.
00:42:12.000,00:42:14.250,Is there something I've got to sign?
00:42:14.291,00:42:16.583,"Yeah, it's right over here."
00:42:16.625,00:42:19.208,I'm takin' this with me. I wanna register it with Essex County.
00:42:22.792,00:42:28.083,America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse.
00:42:29.291,00:42:36.834,"In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new all-out offensive."
00:42:36.875,00:42:39.834,Federal authorities have announced their intention...
00:42:39.875,00:42:49.166,"to establish special narcotics bureaus in Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago-- A detective without the support of his fellow detectives really can't do much."
00:42:51.000,00:42:52.375,You know why I don't have it.
00:42:54.250,00:42:56.792,Doesn't matter.
00:42:56.834,00:43:00.709,"The greatest city in the world, and it's turning into an open sewer."
00:43:01.792,00:43:04.709,"And everybody's stealing, dealing."
00:43:06.500,00:43:08.291,Look at you. You can't work because you did your job.
00:43:10.208,00:43:13.625,Good news is you're not the only honest cop in town.
00:43:13.667,00:43:17.834,The special narcotics bureau in Washington is not a dog and pony show.
00:43:17.875,00:43:19.542,They are sincere.
00:43:19.583,00:43:24.291,"I know this because they want us to orchestrate it, and I want you to head up things here on our end."
00:43:24.333,00:43:26.750,"If it's federal, who do I answer to?"
00:43:26.792,00:43:30.083,"No, you answer to me."
00:43:31.583,00:43:34.041,You never step foot in a police station again.
00:43:34.083,00:43:35.875,You work out of your own place.
00:43:35.917,00:43:41.083,"You pick your own guys, guys that you know would not take a nickel off the sidewalk."
00:43:54.041,00:43:57.542,"Here we go, Jimmy."
00:44:03.250,00:44:05.959,Huey's.
00:44:06.000,00:44:08.250,"- Yeah, who's this?"
00:44:08.291,00:44:10.792,Frank.
00:44:10.834,00:44:12.583,"Frank your brother, Negro."
00:44:12.625,00:44:15.166,Frankie?
00:44:16.208,00:44:17.291,That's right.
00:44:17.333,00:44:20.125,"Hey, Melvin!"
00:44:20.166,00:44:22.208,Where's-- Frank's on the phone!
00:44:22.250,00:44:23.709,"Hey, Ma!"
00:44:23.750,00:44:26.291,Frank on the phone!
00:44:26.333,00:44:28.458,Say what?
00:44:28.500,00:44:30.333,"Frank? Oh, my Lord."
00:44:30.375,00:44:32.542,"Yeah, when? Well, you just say it, man, yeah."
00:44:32.583,00:44:34.792,"Listen, I'm gonna call y'all back at 6:00."
00:44:34.834,00:44:36.667,"I want you to get everybody together, all right?"
00:44:36.709,00:44:38.041,Get Mama.
00:44:38.083,00:44:40.125,Okay.
00:44:47.917,00:44:49.250,Oh.
00:44:54.583,00:44:56.709,"Hey, Frank!"
00:44:56.750,00:44:57.750,"What's happening, Frank?"
00:44:59.083,00:45:00.542,"How you doin', Uncle Frank?"
00:45:00.583,00:45:02.500,Get out the car.
00:45:02.542,00:45:04.875,"Oh, my Lord."
00:45:06.166,00:45:08.083,"Oh, my Lord."
00:45:08.125,00:45:10.208,"I'm so glad to see you, boy."
00:45:10.250,00:45:11.792,"Oh, I'm tellin' you."
00:45:11.834,00:45:15.417,This is some piece of land you got here.
00:45:15.458,00:45:17.834,I wonder what the poor people are doing.
00:45:17.875,00:45:21.041,"- And whose house is that, Frank?"
00:45:21.083,00:45:23.125,Mine?
00:45:24.125,00:45:25.709,And who else?
00:45:27.667,00:45:29.291,"Now, that's my room right there."
00:45:29.333,00:45:31.041,"Right over there, man."
00:45:40.583,00:45:42.250,Shh. Listen.
00:45:42.291,00:45:44.834,I wanna tell you how happy I am...
00:45:44.875,00:45:47.000,to see all my children at the table...
00:45:47.041,00:45:49.250,and the grandchildren at the same time.
00:45:49.291,00:45:50.917,My heart's so happy.
00:45:50.959,00:45:53.417,Enjoy yourselves.
00:45:53.458,00:45:55.625,"I hope you got a job, boy, the way you eatin' over here."
00:45:55.667,00:45:57.917,"That boy right there, he got an arm on him."
00:45:57.959,00:45:59.875,"I mean, a major-league arm."
00:45:59.917,00:46:01.417,"Oh, yeah?"
00:46:01.458,00:46:03.625,"Right on, Pop."
00:46:03.667,00:46:05.959,We'll see after dinner.
00:46:06.000,00:46:08.583,"No, no, you can't catch him, man."
00:46:08.625,00:46:10.917,I'm talkin' about this guy throw harder than Gibson.
00:46:10.959,00:46:13.959,We talkin' 95 miles an hour.
00:46:14.041,00:46:17.959,- Can you catch him?
00:46:18.000,00:46:21.041,"We might have played catch, I think, when I was about five years old."
00:46:21.083,00:46:22.208,Since then he ain't been able to keep up.
00:46:25.750,00:46:29.250,This is your room.
00:46:29.291,00:46:33.083,"Oh, why, it's-- Will you look at this?"
00:46:33.125,00:46:34.500,Oh!
00:46:36.041,00:46:37.750,"Oh, it's beautiful."
00:46:37.792,00:46:39.792,It's beautiful.
00:46:37.792,00:46:50.291,It's just-- H-How did you-- I had it made.
00:46:51.834,00:46:53.542,From memory.
00:46:53.583,00:46:55.500,You were five when they took it away.
00:46:55.542,00:46:56.959,That's right.
00:46:55.542,00:46:58.625,"How could you-- How could I forget, Mama?"
00:47:01.917,00:47:05.709,"Hon, I-I just tell you."
00:47:05.750,00:47:08.500,It-It is perfect.
00:47:08.542,00:47:09.875,It's all perfect.
00:47:14.834,00:47:17.750,I can't tell you how much I love you.
00:47:17.792,00:47:20.333,"I love you too, Mama."
00:47:17.792,00:47:21.792,I can't tell you-- It's okay.
00:47:29.834,00:47:32.125,Both these guys are good with wires.
00:47:32.166,00:47:33.959,They got solid informants.
00:47:34.000,00:47:36.792,"They're honest, and they're fearless."
00:47:36.834,00:47:39.709,"They're insane, Richie, like you."
00:47:39.750,00:47:41.083,Where are they?
00:47:42.792,00:47:47.625,"Uh, that's, uh-- That's Jones with the skinny white broad."
00:47:47.667,00:47:49.208,Best I ever seen on the street.
00:47:49.250,00:47:51.834,"Knows dope, but he's together."
00:47:51.875,00:47:55.166,All right?
00:47:55.208,00:47:58.083,And that's Abruzzo with the two fat black ones.
00:47:59.333,00:48:01.875,"He-- He loves a big ass, man."
00:48:03.166,00:48:05.041,He-- He's a bulldog.
00:48:05.083,00:48:06.709,"He don't fuck around, all right?"
00:48:06.750,00:48:10.709,"He's got a bit of a temper, yeah, but you could trust this guy with your grandmother."
00:48:10.750,00:48:13.291,"Listen, Richie."
00:48:13.333,00:48:15.041,"You want me, you gotta take them too."
00:48:27.834,00:48:29.041,So when we start?
00:48:32.417,00:48:35.500,The man I worked for had one of the biggest companies in New York City.
00:48:35.542,00:48:38.333,He ran it for more than 50 years.
00:48:38.375,00:48:43.125,"Fifteen years, eight months and nine days, I was with him every day."
00:48:43.166,00:48:44.583,I worked for him.
00:48:44.625,00:48:46.208,I looked after him.
00:48:47.959,00:48:50.667,"Bumpy was rich, but he wasn't white-man rich, see?"
00:48:50.709,00:48:53.333,He wasn't wealthy.
00:48:53.375,00:48:56.083,"He thought he did, but he didn't."
00:48:56.125,00:48:57.917,"White man owned it, so they owned him."
00:48:59.041,00:49:00.625,Nobody owns me though.
00:49:00.667,00:49:02.500,"- How you doin', baby?"
00:49:02.542,00:49:08.375,"That's 'cause I own my own company, and my company sells a product that's better than the competition..."
00:49:08.417,00:49:12.000,at a price that's lower than the competition.
00:49:12.041,00:49:14.291,"Well, what we sellin' here, Frank?"
00:49:27.583,00:49:30.000,"How you doin', Red?"
00:49:31.709,00:49:34.208,These are my brothers.
00:49:34.250,00:49:35.917,"Everybody, this is Redtop."
00:49:35.959,00:49:37.208,"Hey, how you doin'?"
00:49:40.125,00:49:41.375,What's wrong?
00:49:41.417,00:49:43.375,Why they all naked?
00:49:43.417,00:49:45.041,So they can't steal nothin'.
00:49:45.083,00:49:47.375,All right.
00:49:47.417,00:49:57.750,"Most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hard work, family, never forgetting where we came from."
00:49:57.792,00:49:59.208,"Thank you, Charlene."
00:50:04.166,00:50:06.291,"See, you are what you are in this world."
00:50:07.417,00:50:08.792,That's either one of two things.
00:50:11.250,00:50:14.875,Either you're somebody...
00:50:14.917,00:50:16.250,Be right back.
00:50:31.917,00:50:34.000,Mmm. I need these fresh.
00:50:34.041,00:50:36.083,"If I have to come back here and get you, you know what it is."
00:50:36.125,00:50:37.792,Tango.
00:50:37.834,00:50:40.125,"Yes, sir. I hear you."
00:50:40.166,00:50:41.667,"What about you, Frank?"
00:50:41.709,00:50:43.834,Where's my money?
00:50:43.875,00:50:45.709,You're supposed to be handing me my money.
00:50:45.750,00:50:47.458,Here's a jar right here.
00:50:47.500,00:50:49.166,"Oh, you got the jar?"
00:50:49.208,00:50:52.792,"Get the fuck out of here, Fra-- Oh."
00:50:52.834,00:50:55.375,What you gonna do?
00:50:55.417,00:50:57.000,Huh? What you doin'?
00:50:57.041,00:51:00.166,You gonna shoot me?
00:51:02.625,00:51:04.208,"Oh, shit."
00:51:16.166,00:51:19.041,There you go.
00:51:42.333,00:51:44.041,"So, what was I saying?"
00:51:49.166,00:51:58.083,Uh-- This is the newly-formed Essex County narcotics squad.
00:51:59.709,00:52:03.917,Our mandate is to make major arrests.
00:52:03.959,00:52:06.625,We're looking for the suppliers and the distributors.
00:52:07.625,00:52:12.375,"Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, no grass under a thousand pounds, no powder under 40 kilograms."
00:52:12.417,00:52:14.625,"Any less than that, then somebody else can waste their time."
00:52:14.667,00:52:18.291,"We're gonna be handling the big shipments, the big money and the big temptation."
00:52:18.333,00:52:22.250,"I heard a story about you, that you found a million dollars in unmarked cash..."
00:52:22.291,00:52:23.709,and you gave that shit back.
00:52:23.750,00:52:25.417,Is that true?
00:52:25.458,00:52:27.834,"Yeah, I did."
00:52:33.083,00:52:35.542,"So do I, you know?"
00:52:35.583,00:52:37.500,I should be down in South Florida with a 68-foot cruiser...
00:52:37.542,00:52:39.333,doin' fishing charters.
00:52:39.375,00:52:41.959,"But, you know, I didn't."
00:52:42.000,00:52:45.583,"And, uh, we'll be looking to land some other kind of sharks."
00:53:12.750,00:53:14.208,All right?
00:53:36.875,00:53:38.792,Hmm.
00:53:38.834,00:53:40.709,"See that, Richie?"
00:53:40.750,00:53:42.834,"Now, this stuff is your everyday stuff, you know?"
00:53:42.875,00:53:45.750,But this Blue Magic-- twice the potency.
00:53:45.792,00:53:49.208,"I mean, it's the purest thing I've ever seen on the streets."
00:53:49.250,00:53:51.125,Strong enough to smoke.
00:53:51.166,00:53:54.333,And that's for those white suburban kids who's scared of needles.
00:53:54.375,00:53:56.250,I paid 10 bucks for that.
00:53:56.291,00:53:58.917,And it's everywhere.
00:53:58.959,00:54:00.625,So how is that possible?
00:54:00.667,00:54:03.875,Who can afford to sell shit twice as good for half as much?
00:54:12.125,00:54:15.083,"Hey, man, Frankie baby."
00:54:15.125,00:54:17.667,Everything is good?
00:54:17.709,00:54:19.000,Over there for two months.
00:54:22.458,00:54:24.333,This way. This way.
00:54:34.041,00:54:36.375,"You know what I'm sayin', man?"
00:54:36.417,00:54:37.750,Over here!
00:54:42.291,00:54:44.291,Whoo!
00:54:44.333,00:54:46.250,"Look at you, my man."
00:54:54.208,00:54:56.291,"All right, all right, all right."
00:54:56.333,00:55:02.041,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Brown Bomber, the champ, Mr. Joe Louis."
00:55:11.208,00:55:14.375,Who's that with Joe?
00:55:14.417,00:55:17.000,Puerto Rico?
00:55:17.041,00:55:20.458,She a beauty queen?
00:55:45.375,00:55:48.375,My main man.
00:55:52.542,00:55:55.000,"Can y'all excuse us for a minute, please?"
00:55:55.041,00:55:57.625,"Yeah, sure, Frank."
00:55:57.667,00:55:59.000,Thank you.
00:56:03.250,00:56:04.959,"What's goin' on, man?"
00:56:05.000,00:56:06.750,What you smiling about?
00:56:06.792,00:56:08.458,What is it?
00:56:08.500,00:56:10.125,Huh?
00:56:10.166,00:56:11.500,Come here.
00:56:13.250,00:56:15.458,What is that you got on?
00:56:15.500,00:56:18.125,"What-- Yeah, that."
00:56:18.166,00:56:19.959,"It's a very, very, very nice suit."
00:56:20.000,00:56:21.625,"That's a very, very, very nice suit, huh?"
00:56:21.667,00:56:23.542,That's a clown suit.
00:56:23.583,00:56:26.291,with a big sign on it that says arrest me.
00:56:26.333,00:56:28.500,You understand?
00:56:28.542,00:56:30.959,Look at me.
00:56:31.000,00:56:32.667,is the weakest one in the room.
00:56:32.709,00:56:34.625,I told you that.
00:56:34.667,00:56:36.333,You trying to be like Nicky Barnes and them?
00:56:36.375,00:56:37.792,What's your problem with Nicky?
00:56:37.834,00:56:39.250,I ain't got no problem with Nicky.
00:56:39.291,00:56:40.875,"Oh, you like Nicky?"
00:56:40.917,00:56:42.333,You wanna be like Nicky?
00:56:42.375,00:56:44.041,"You wanna work for him, huh?"
00:56:45.834,00:56:47.125,"Share a jail cell with him, maybe cook for him?"
00:56:48.625,00:56:50.458,"Oh, so now you talking to him about me?"
00:56:50.500,00:56:53.750,What is it like?
00:56:53.792,00:56:57.041,About what?
00:56:59.750,00:57:05.792,"You know. Boy, you-- You know if you wasn't my brother, I'd kill you."
00:57:05.834,00:57:07.500,I'd blow your motherfuckin' brains out.
00:57:07.542,00:57:09.208,"Come on, man."
00:57:09.250,00:57:12.083,I'm taking you shopping this week.
00:57:42.500,00:57:43.500,Hey.
00:57:46.250,00:57:48.834,"You still owe me that dance, right?"
00:57:48.875,00:57:51.834,"Frank, check this."
00:58:01.208,00:58:02.750,How you doing?
00:58:02.792,00:58:03.834,Hi.
00:58:03.875,00:58:06.375,Frank Lucas.
00:58:06.417,00:58:08.333,Nice to meet you.
00:58:08.375,00:58:10.417,"Nice to meet you, Frank."
00:58:10.458,00:58:13.417,"You're Frank, and this is your place?"
00:58:13.458,00:58:16.625,"That's right. I'm Frank, and this is my place."
00:58:21.375,00:58:23.667,Why is it called Small's?
00:58:23.709,00:58:25.291,Why didn't you call it Frank's?
00:58:26.917,00:58:29.250,"Well, when you own something, you call it what you want."
00:58:30.458,00:58:32.208,Small's.
00:58:32.250,00:58:34.667,Or Frank's.
00:58:34.709,00:58:36.250,Small's Frankie.
00:58:38.500,00:58:41.041,That's right.
00:58:44.000,00:58:45.375,Okay.
00:58:46.250,00:58:47.959,You leaving?
00:58:48.000,00:58:49.709,"No, I was going to my table."
00:58:49.750,00:58:51.291,Okay. You need somebody to go with you?
00:58:53.917,00:58:55.291,Yes?
00:58:58.458,00:59:00.166,All the cheesies.
00:59:00.208,00:59:02.000,"Hey, hey, what do we got here?"
00:59:02.041,00:59:05.792,You wash your hands?
00:59:05.834,00:59:07.500,There you go.
00:59:07.542,00:59:09.250,what about him?
00:59:09.291,00:59:11.458,"Joey Sodano, Don Cattano's nephew."
00:59:11.500,00:59:13.750,"Ah, yeah, put him up there by the big man."
00:59:13.792,00:59:16.625,"He looks like your uncle, Abruzzo."
00:59:16.667,00:59:19.333,He looks more like your sister.
00:59:19.375,00:59:21.208,You guys should take that show on the road.
00:59:21.250,00:59:23.208,"So we need, uh, Ice Pick Paul."
00:59:23.250,00:59:25.959,Ice Pick Paul?
00:59:26.000,00:59:29.250,Ice Pick Paul.
00:59:29.291,00:59:32.083,Ice Pick Paul is a fuckin' soldier.
00:59:32.125,00:59:34.667,This guy's a lieutenant.
00:59:36.667,00:59:40.083,That guy is a soldier.
00:59:40.125,00:59:41.458,You're thinking of Benny the Bishop.
00:59:44.709,00:59:46.333,Jonesy's right.
00:59:46.375,00:59:49.291,Which one of you guys has ever seen Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?
00:59:49.333,00:59:51.709,Actually seen it go down?
00:59:51.750,00:59:53.291,"Yeah, seen it go down."
00:59:53.333,00:59:55.291,Been in his place.
00:59:55.333,00:59:57.083,That rat Ricky has told us.
00:59:57.125,00:59:59.000,He's fuckin' dead.
00:59:59.041,01:00:00.875,About four weeks ago.
01:00:00.917,01:00:03.542,"Hey, hey."
01:00:03.583,01:00:05.625,"Well, we can take him off the fuckin' board."
01:00:05.667,01:00:10.375,I don't think we've got any solid evidence on anybody on that board.
01:00:10.417,01:00:11.583,"What are you saying, Richie?"
01:00:11.625,01:00:13.834,"This is weeks and weeks of work, man."
01:00:13.875,01:00:17.000,I'm saying take it down.
01:00:19.166,01:00:22.208,"That's considerably more than one year's salary, Richie."
01:00:23.792,01:00:27.542,"If it disappears, we will not be able to get it for you again."
01:00:29.083,01:00:32.834,That's yours.
01:00:32.875,01:00:35.083,for a lousy 20 grand.
01:00:36.959,01:00:39.208,"It has to be Blue Magic, right?"
01:00:39.250,01:00:41.458,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna be Blue."
01:00:41.500,01:00:43.041,You can pick it up here tomorrow.
01:00:43.083,01:00:46.166,"$20,000."
01:00:59.792,01:01:01.875,How'd you do?
01:01:03.917,01:01:05.709,Here he comes.
01:01:05.750,01:01:07.375,That's him?
01:01:07.417,01:01:08.750,That was quick.
01:01:21.709,01:01:24.041,"Richie, he goes into the city, what do we fuckin' do?"
01:01:24.083,01:01:27.375,Stay with the fuckin' money.
01:01:27.417,01:01:30.667,"Yes, we can."
01:01:30.709,01:01:33.250,- I ain't losing it.
01:01:33.291,01:01:35.959,"- All right, all right, all right, all right!"
01:01:49.959,01:01:51.667,He's pulling over.
01:01:51.709,01:01:53.792,"All right, here we go."
01:01:53.834,01:01:55.125,Let me out here.
01:01:57.583,01:02:00.417,"- Don't disappear, all right?"
01:02:01.792,01:02:03.458,Move!
01:02:37.709,01:02:40.500,"Frankie, Frankie, sit down."
01:02:42.291,01:02:44.208,"Happy birthday, gentlemen."
01:02:44.250,01:02:46.500,"What the fuck is this over here, huh?"
01:02:46.542,01:02:47.875,You going bowling?
01:02:49.333,01:02:50.667,"Ah, look at that."
01:02:50.709,01:02:52.166,What's between your legs?
01:02:52.208,01:02:54.041,Nothing.
01:02:54.083,01:02:55.667,Get up.
01:02:55.709,01:02:58.583,What's your real name?
01:02:58.625,01:03:00.333,Sit down and shut up.
01:03:00.375,01:03:01.375,Don't you move.
01:03:13.625,01:03:15.083,"Hey, guys?"
01:03:15.125,01:03:17.959,Guys. Officers.
01:03:18.000,01:03:20.875,"Hey, I'm Richie Roberts from Newark."
01:03:20.917,01:03:23.500,"Uh, that's my money."
01:03:23.542,01:03:26.792,What the fuck?
01:03:28.333,01:03:30.625,"The bills are sequenced, right?"
01:03:30.667,01:03:32.625,They're registered with the Essex County prosecutor's office.
01:03:32.667,01:03:33.834,Just check them out.
01:03:33.875,01:03:35.792,They all start with CF3500.
01:03:35.834,01:03:37.166,Have a look.
01:03:41.375,01:03:43.125,It fuckin' registers.
01:03:43.166,01:03:46.542,I thought I had a fuckin' Chris-Craft sitting in my driveway.
01:03:46.583,01:03:49.500,Honest mistake.
01:03:51.333,01:03:52.959,This time.
01:03:53.000,01:03:56.333,All right.
01:03:56.375,01:03:59.083,When was the last time I was in Jersey?
01:04:00.917,01:04:02.500,Never.
01:04:04.458,01:04:06.417,What are you doing coming over here unannounced?
01:04:06.458,01:04:09.208,Don't you think you could get hurt doing that?
01:04:10.750,01:04:14.667,"You got your fuckin' money, Richie."
01:04:14.709,01:04:18.291,"And never, ever come into this city again unannounced."
01:04:18.333,01:04:23.375,"You come in to see a fuckin' Broadway show, you call ahead first, see if it's okay with me."
01:04:25.500,01:04:27.583,No problem.
01:04:30.834,01:04:32.291,Let's go hit some balls.
01:04:32.333,01:04:33.333,"Great suits, huh?"
01:04:35.792,01:04:38.083,That your car?
01:04:38.125,01:04:40.125,That's a fuckin' great car.
01:04:40.166,01:04:44.291,Have a nice fuckin' trip back to Jersey.
01:04:44.333,01:04:46.583,Come on. I got a tee time.
01:04:59.417,01:05:02.291,This is your father?
01:05:02.333,01:05:04.583,That's Martin Luther King.
01:05:04.625,01:05:06.291,It is not.
01:05:06.333,01:05:08.458,Martin Luther King.
01:05:08.500,01:05:12.250,Of course.
01:05:08.500,01:05:15.875,"No, that's, uh-- He was just as important as Martin Luther King..."
01:05:15.917,01:05:18.291,What did he do?
01:05:18.333,01:05:21.667,He was a friend and served New York.
01:05:21.709,01:05:23.375,New York served him.
01:05:24.750,01:05:27.750,"He was my boss, my teacher."
01:05:27.792,01:05:29.834,What did he teach you?
01:05:29.875,01:05:31.709,He taught me a lot of things. He...
01:05:33.750,01:05:37.291,taught me how to take my time.
01:05:37.333,01:05:41.083,"Taught me that if I was gonna do something, to do it with care, with love."
01:05:42.125,01:05:43.458,Anything else?
01:05:48.333,01:05:50.166,Taught me to be a gentleman.
01:05:50.208,01:05:52.083,That's what you are?
01:05:52.125,01:05:54.500,That's what I try to be.
01:05:55.750,01:05:57.208,Come here.
01:05:59.542,01:06:01.542,Look at me.
01:06:01.583,01:06:04.875,I own about five apartments in Manhattan.
01:06:06.041,01:06:07.750,Homes all over the east coast.
01:06:07.792,01:06:10.834,"I could've taken you to any one of them, but I didn't."
01:06:10.875,01:06:13.417,"- I brought you here-- I was looking for you, boy."
01:06:13.458,01:06:15.458,Because I wanted you to meet my mother.
01:06:15.500,01:06:17.208,"How you doing, Ma?"
01:06:17.250,01:06:19.667,- Is this her?
01:06:19.709,01:06:20.959,Hi. Eva.
01:06:21.000,01:06:22.667,Nice to meet you.
01:06:22.709,01:06:24.166,She's beautiful.
01:06:24.208,01:06:25.875,"Look at her, Frank."
01:06:25.917,01:06:29.583,She's an angel come down from heaven.

01:07:05.583,01:07:07.125,"Hey, how are you?"
01:07:09.041,01:07:10.583,She did mention your name though.
01:07:11.709,01:07:13.667,The stewardess?
01:07:13.709,01:07:17.083,"No, not the stewardess."
01:07:17.125,01:07:18.834,She mentioned your name...
01:07:18.875,01:07:20.875,right after she asked me...
01:07:20.917,01:07:23.542,if I associated with any criminals.
01:07:23.583,01:07:26.417,You wanna see this? Go.
01:07:27.291,01:07:29.542,"Joey. Hey, Joey!"
01:07:29.583,01:07:31.458,Get in the pool.
01:07:31.500,01:07:33.500,"Come on, come on."
01:07:38.250,01:07:40.750,So how'd she get my name?
01:07:40.792,01:07:43.000,Laurie.
01:07:43.041,01:07:44.875,She's been saying a lot lately.
01:07:45.875,01:07:47.583,A lot.
01:07:50.917,01:07:55.667,"You know, when you asked me to be your son's godfather, I took it very seriously."
01:07:55.709,01:07:57.667,"I know. I know, and I appreciate that."
01:07:57.709,01:08:03.375,"And I said yes, I would take on this responsibility, take care of your son if, God forbid, something happened to you."
01:08:03.417,01:08:06.208,"Joe, the kind of things she's saying to Child Social Services..."
01:08:06.250,01:08:07.709,"made me look really bad, all right?"
01:08:07.750,01:08:15.041,"You know, out all kinds of hours at nighttime, low-life informants around, women-- Old friends like me."
01:08:16.125,01:08:17.333,"Old friends like you, yeah."
01:08:20.125,01:08:22.125,Uncle Joey!
01:08:25.458,01:08:27.291,"Okay, I understand."
01:08:27.333,01:08:29.959,"They ask me, I'll tell 'em what you want me to tell 'em."
01:08:30.000,01:08:33.792,I'll lie for you.
01:08:33.834,01:08:37.291,Just... omit certain details.
01:08:37.333,01:08:39.000,Sure. All right.
01:08:41.583,01:08:43.917,"Now, there's something else I was gonna ask you."
01:08:43.959,01:08:45.834,You don't have to answer if you don't wanna.
01:08:48.959,01:08:51.375,Blue Magic.
01:08:52.709,01:08:54.542,Just a lot of sorrow and misery...
01:08:54.583,01:08:56.917,"from guys getting put out of work, that's all."
01:08:58.917,01:09:01.166,"What, your guys?"
01:09:03.250,01:09:05.875,Anything about where it's coming from?
01:09:05.917,01:09:08.875,Guys down south.
01:09:08.917,01:09:10.917,Cubans?
01:09:12.166,01:09:15.333,"Uh, Mexico?"
01:09:15.375,01:09:17.625,Are you telling me it's coming in from South America?
01:09:17.667,01:09:19.959,I don't know.
01:09:20.000,01:09:26.625,"All I can tell you is whoever it is, they're upsetting the natural order of things, and that's all there is."
01:09:42.458,01:09:45.834,What's up?
01:10:16.458,01:10:41.083,of the ghetto getting up didn't cross - Hey.
01:11:13.834,01:11:17.333,"Frank, I want you to meet Mike Sibota."
01:11:17.375,01:11:18.625,"How you doin', Mr. Sibota?"
01:11:18.667,01:11:20.333,What can I get you?
01:11:20.375,01:11:21.792,"From what Charlie tells me, your nephew."
01:11:21.834,01:11:23.125,"Oh, this the-- Yankees."
01:11:23.166,01:11:25.083,"Yankees. Yeah, yeah."

01:11:26.917,01:11:28.917,"This boy's good, okay?"
01:11:28.959,01:11:30.667,"'Cause you good enough, ain't you?"
01:11:30.709,01:11:32.417,"Good enough on a bad day, Jack."
01:11:34.250,01:11:35.208,"Good enough on a bad day, so don't make it a bad day."
01:11:35.250,01:11:36.667,NYPD.
01:11:36.709,01:11:39.625,Excuse me.
01:11:39.667,01:11:41.458,"Oh, hey, whoa!"

01:11:44.333,01:11:46.792,"No, no, you can't take me in for that."
01:11:46.834,01:11:49.208,Where's the handcuffs?
01:11:49.250,01:11:51.166,What the hell's wrong with you?

01:11:54.125,01:11:57.208,"Oh, shit."
01:11:57.250,01:11:58.375,I gotta arrest you for that shit.
01:11:58.417,01:12:00.083,That shit's too good to be on the street.
01:12:00.125,01:12:03.583,"What are you doin', man?"
01:12:03.625,01:12:05.583,You bribin' me now?
01:12:05.625,01:12:07.375,"Hell, yeah."
01:12:07.417,01:12:10.208,I'll arrest everybody.
01:12:10.250,01:12:11.709,He gonna bail you out.

01:12:20.000,01:12:22.083,"I said, what the hell was that?"
01:12:22.125,01:12:25.166,What's your fuckin' problem?

01:12:49.458,01:12:50.959,"All right, everybody, get out."
01:12:51.000,01:12:53.041,Get out!
01:12:53.083,01:12:54.792,"Come on, Frank."
01:12:54.834,01:12:56.709,no goddamn accident.
01:12:56.750,01:12:59.250,He don't feel shit 'cause he coked up all the motherfuckin' time.
01:13:00.417,01:13:02.667,He's your driver.
01:13:02.709,01:13:04.250,"Come on, man."
01:13:04.291,01:13:05.959,It ain't shit to me.
01:13:06.000,01:13:07.250,What's he gonna do?
01:13:08.625,01:13:09.834,I don't give a damn what he does.
01:13:09.875,01:13:11.583,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:13:11.625,01:13:13.208,You blot that.
01:13:13.250,01:13:16.917,That's alpaca.
01:13:16.959,01:13:20.500,You blot that shit.
01:13:20.542,01:13:23.291,Simple Simon-ass motherfucker.
01:13:23.333,01:13:25.333,"don't nobody talk to me directly, you understand?"
01:13:25.375,01:13:27.667,"You got business with me, you talk to Huey."
01:13:27.709,01:13:30.125,"Huey, you talk to me."
01:13:30.166,01:13:31.875,"Damn it, never on the phone, you got it?"
01:13:31.917,01:13:33.166,I got it.
01:13:33.208,01:13:35.291,And take them goddamn sunglasses off.
01:13:35.333,01:13:38.458,Take the goddamn sunglasses off.
01:13:41.083,01:13:43.542,Simple Simon-ass motherfuckers.
01:13:58.959,01:14:03.041,"The whole place was imported, brick by brick."
01:14:04.208,01:14:05.583,Gloucestershire.
01:14:06.583,01:14:07.750,Who?
01:14:07.792,01:14:09.583,Great Britain.
01:14:09.625,01:14:11.000,Yours.
01:14:15.875,01:14:17.250,Here you go.
01:14:20.917,01:14:22.291,Pull.
01:14:28.583,01:14:30.000,"Come, Eva."
01:14:31.542,01:14:34.125,"Um, I'm sure you're dying to see the rest of the house, hmm?"
01:14:37.834,01:14:39.542,Of course.
01:14:39.583,01:14:41.125,Excuse me.
01:14:41.166,01:14:43.500,Thank you for a wonderful lunch.
01:14:43.542,01:14:44.875,It was delicious.
01:14:47.834,01:14:49.917,What you think of monopolies?
01:14:51.500,01:14:59.250,"You mean, like the game, or-- No, I just think monopolies are made illegal in the country, Frank, 'cause nobody wants to compete, you know?"
01:14:59.291,01:15:02.583,"Nobody wants to compete, not with a monopoly."
01:15:02.625,01:15:05.041,"I mean, you let the dairy farmers do that, right?"
01:15:05.083,01:15:07.625,Half of them would be out of business tomorrow.
01:15:07.667,01:15:10.417,Just trying to make a living.
01:15:10.458,01:15:13.709,It's everyone's right.
01:15:13.750,01:15:18.625,We just can't do it at that unreasonable expense of others.
01:15:18.667,01:15:22.792,"Then it becomes un-American, and that's why the price we pay for that gallon of milk..."
01:15:22.834,01:15:27.583,"could never represent the true cost of production, 'cause it's gotta be controlled, gotta be set."
01:15:27.625,01:15:29.250,It's gotta be fair.
01:15:29.291,01:15:32.250,Gotta be controlled by who?
01:15:32.291,01:15:34.417,I don't think it's fair.
01:15:32.291,01:15:39.625,"I think it's-- I know your customers are happy, Frank, bunch of fuckin' junkies that they are."
01:15:39.667,01:15:44.333,"But we fellow dairy farmers out here, Frank-- Are you thinkin' of us?"
01:15:44.375,01:15:46.417,You thinkin' of them?
01:15:46.458,01:15:48.917,The dairy farmers.
01:15:48.959,01:15:53.000,"I'm thinking of them, Dominic, about as much as they've ever thought about me."
01:15:53.041,01:15:55.208,I'm just thinking out loud now.
01:15:55.250,01:16:04.000,"If you took some of your inventory, Frank, and you sold it wholesale-- Sit."
01:16:04.917,01:16:06.709,We could work.
01:16:06.750,01:16:08.041,We could do some distribution.
01:16:09.500,01:16:11.208,I don't know.
01:16:11.250,01:16:14.750,"I got 110th, 155th, river to river."
01:16:14.792,01:16:18.291,"Well, it's kind of a mom-and-pop store next to what I'm talking about."
01:16:18.333,01:16:20.291,Let's go at least bigger than Kmart.
01:16:20.333,01:16:22.917,"I'm talking about L.A., Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas."
01:16:22.959,01:16:25.375,"Let's go nationwide, huh?"
01:16:25.417,01:16:28.083,I'm gonna guarantee you your peace of mind here.
01:16:28.125,01:16:29.750,You don't want that?
01:16:30.875,01:16:33.250,You're gonna need it.
01:16:33.291,01:16:35.125,"I don't know how you view me, you know."
01:16:35.166,01:16:37.083,"I'm kind of a Renaissance man, Frank."
01:16:37.125,01:16:41.291,"The people I deal with on a daily basis, they're not enlightened, Frank."
01:16:41.333,01:16:43.458,"You talk to them about civil rights, they don't know."
01:16:43.500,01:16:45.417,They're not open to change.
01:16:45.458,01:16:48.917,Not from the way things are done and who's doing it. Hmm?
01:16:48.959,01:16:50.291,I talk to them.
01:16:50.333,01:16:52.166,There's just no misunderstandings.
01:16:53.750,01:16:56.792,And that's what I mean for your peace of mind.
01:16:59.083,01:17:00.458,Yeah.
01:17:01.834,01:17:04.333,"You're paying, what, 75, 80,000 a kilo?"
01:17:06.959,01:17:08.750,I'm a Renaissance man too.
01:17:10.125,01:17:11.750,"I'll consider 50,000."
01:17:20.458,01:17:22.250,Why would you trust these people?
01:17:22.291,01:17:26.792,"And the way they look at you-- They look at me like it's Christmas, and I'm Santa Claus."
01:17:26.834,01:17:28.542,They look at us like we're the help.
01:17:29.792,01:17:31.333,They work for me now.
01:17:37.000,01:17:43.792,"I predict that when I meet Joe Frazier, this will be like a good amateur fighting a real professional."
01:17:43.834,01:17:46.041,This will be like a kid out of the Olympics...
01:17:46.083,01:17:48.542,"That's gonna be Ali in, like, three."
01:17:48.583,01:17:51.208,"Oh, man."
01:17:51.250,01:17:53.875,You not fightin' Sonny Liston.
01:17:53.917,01:17:56.291,Everybody knows that.
01:17:56.333,01:17:59.000,"Ali gonna crush him, baby."
01:17:59.041,01:18:02.750,Stop me? You?
01:18:02.792,01:18:05.125,"Look, don't let him obligate you."
01:18:06.333,01:18:09.709,"Tonight, March 8, 1971."
01:18:09.750,01:18:16.125,"Here we are at Madison Square Garden for the fight of the century, and by anybody's definition, this is a happening."
01:18:16.166,01:18:21.083,"There are handshakes, and, of course, there are utterly beautiful women."
01:18:21.125,01:18:28.083,"But behind the smiles and behind the handshakes, you can feel the atmosphere so heavy with tension, it's almost unbearable."
01:18:28.125,01:18:34.625,"Everybody who is anybody is here, like Sinatra, like Graziano, David Frost and Diahann Carroll..."
01:18:34.667,01:18:36.709,and Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.
01:18:36.750,01:18:38.583,The celebrities are pouring in.
01:18:38.625,01:18:42.542,"The way you all build it up-- Life magazine cover, Time magazine."
01:18:42.583,01:18:44.250,Everybody gives their opinion.
01:18:44.291,01:18:46.166,Dempsey says I'll lose.
01:18:46.208,01:18:51.000,"Joe Louis. And when Joe Louis say I'm gonna lose, I know I done won this one."
01:18:51.041,01:18:55.208,Joe Louis-- Joe Louis always picks the wrong man.
01:18:51.041,01:18:58.500,Always picks the wrong-- Where Joe Louis at?
01:19:01.333,01:19:04.333,"Baby. Oh, God."
01:19:06.041,01:19:08.959,"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee."
01:19:09.000,01:19:11.166,"Not watchin' the fight, Bob?"
01:19:11.208,01:19:12.750,I'm not into boxing.
01:19:13.750,01:19:16.583,"This ain't boxing, kid."
01:19:16.625,01:19:18.500,It's politics.
01:19:21.500,01:19:24.125,I got something for you too.
01:19:25.875,01:19:28.625,Hmm?
01:19:28.667,01:19:29.667,Mm-hmm.
01:19:30.750,01:19:32.625,Do you like it?
01:19:32.667,01:19:34.792,The coat?
01:19:35.875,01:19:38.625,Hmm?
01:19:38.667,01:19:40.458,Yeah.
01:19:40.500,01:19:41.542,Yeah.
01:19:41.583,01:19:43.417,Mmm. Mmm.
01:19:49.417,01:19:51.458,"Over here, Sammy!"
01:19:51.500,01:19:53.083,"Hey, Sammy, give a look!"
01:19:54.625,01:19:56.750,"Joe Louis, over here!"
01:19:56.792,01:19:58.625,"How's it going, Frank?"
01:20:09.125,01:20:13.834,"Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have quite a list of introductions."
01:20:13.875,01:20:19.709,We are now going to introduce people from all endeavors of life.
01:20:19.750,01:20:26.000,"And not just show people, because everyone is here tonight."
01:20:36.417,01:20:38.417,Main event!
01:20:38.458,01:20:40.500,Where's Muhammed Ali?
01:20:40.542,01:20:42.750,Fifteen rounds...
01:20:42.792,01:20:47.917,for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world.
01:20:47.959,01:20:49.417,"There we go, Ali!"
01:20:49.458,01:20:52.208,"From Louisville, Kentucky."
01:20:52.250,01:20:54.291,"Champ, this is Frank Lucas."
01:20:57.625,01:21:00.959,Here is Muhammad Ali!
01:21:02.583,01:21:07.000,"His opponent, from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
01:21:07.041,01:21:09.375,He's wearing green trunks.
01:21:09.417,01:21:11.166,Who's that laughing with Cattano?
01:21:11.208,01:21:14.041,There. How'd he get so fuckin' close to the ring?
01:21:15.583,01:21:20.500,"Champion of the world, Joe Frazier!"
01:21:22.959,01:21:27.417,"Frank, you gonna keep that hat on all night?"
01:21:27.458,01:21:28.458,You paid for it.
01:21:30.583,01:21:33.000,"for this, baby!"
01:21:33.041,01:21:34.709,"Joe, over here!"
01:21:34.750,01:21:37.208,"Good evening, Joe, Muhammed."
01:21:37.250,01:21:38.959,"You don't stand a chance, Frazier!"
01:22:14.333,01:22:16.875,he's a supplier at most or just a pimp.
01:22:16.917,01:22:18.125,Otherwise we'd know his name.
01:22:18.166,01:22:19.792,His tickets were phenomenal.
01:22:19.834,01:22:21.875,"Better seats than Dominic Cattano, right?"
01:22:21.917,01:22:23.875,Joe Louis shook his hand.
01:22:25.417,01:22:26.875,Who the fuck is this guy?
01:22:30.500,01:22:32.458,What's this?
01:22:32.500,01:22:35.041,"That's the, uh, plate off the limo."
01:22:35.083,01:22:37.834,Check with the company who rented it.
01:22:40.417,01:22:41.792,"Right there, Mr. Lucas."
01:22:41.834,01:22:42.875,Right there.
01:22:47.458,01:22:48.667,"Lookin' good, Frank!"
01:22:52.667,01:22:54.583,"Right on, Frankie!"
01:22:54.625,01:22:55.959,Congratulations!
01:23:01.834,01:23:03.875,She's the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
01:23:03.917,01:23:05.875,"That's my sunshine right there, Mr. Williams."
01:23:05.917,01:23:07.417,I wish Bumpy had met her.
01:23:07.458,01:23:08.792,Throw it to me!
01:23:13.417,01:23:14.792,Get a picture.
01:23:24.542,01:23:26.792,Well?
01:23:51.250,01:23:53.083,What's happening?
01:23:55.208,01:23:56.667,"Congratulations, Frank."
01:23:56.709,01:23:58.583,Detective.
01:23:58.625,01:24:00.458,You sure you done the right thing?
01:24:00.500,01:24:02.875,"I mean, she's a beautiful girl and all."
01:24:02.917,01:24:04.500,"Hey, hey, listen."
01:24:06.000,01:24:10.000,"Before you say anything about me or about my wife, understand this is the most important day of my life, Detective."
01:24:10.041,01:24:12.542,"Oh, I understand."
01:24:12.583,01:24:14.834,"A man walks around in a $50,000 chinchilla coat..."
01:24:14.875,01:24:19.417,"and never even bought me a cup of coffee, there's something wrong there."
01:24:19.458,01:24:20.458,"You pay your bills, Frank?"
01:24:22.291,01:24:24.083,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:24:26.041,01:24:27.667,"If you're not getting your share, maybe you need to talk to the chief of police."
01:24:27.709,01:24:30.500,What's my share?
01:24:30.542,01:24:31.959,Maybe I'm special.
01:24:32.000,01:24:33.959,You are special.
01:24:34.000,01:24:36.208,You see that right there?
01:24:36.250,01:24:38.417,Special Investigations Unit.
01:24:39.709,01:24:42.083,Special.
01:24:43.333,01:24:46.500,Ten grand.
01:24:46.542,01:24:48.834,Deliver it right here.
01:24:48.875,01:24:50.709,Are you done?
01:24:54.625,01:24:57.208,Don't forget your card.
01:24:57.250,01:24:58.583,Let's go.
01:25:57.875,01:26:03.000,"His name is Frank Lucas, originally from Greensboro, North Carolina."
01:26:03.041,01:26:04.583,Couple of arrests years ago.
01:26:04.625,01:26:08.542,"Uh, gambling and unlicensed firearm."
01:26:08.583,01:26:12.500,"For 15 years, he was Bumpy Johnson's driver, bodyguard and collector."
01:26:14.458,01:26:16.625,He was with him when he died.
01:26:16.667,01:26:18.166,He's got five brothers.
01:26:18.208,01:26:22.000,He's the oldest.
01:26:22.041,01:26:25.792,"They're all living up here now, spread throughout the five boroughs and Jersey."
01:26:26.917,01:26:31.375,The brothers are Dexter-- - What can I do for you?
01:26:31.417,01:26:32.417,Picking up.
01:26:32.458,01:26:34.792,- Yeah.
01:26:34.834,01:26:37.208,Melvin in Queens has got a custom furniture and fire doors business.
01:26:39.750,01:26:41.125,This is right here?
01:26:41.166,01:26:44.417,Terrence in Newark has a hardware store.
01:26:44.458,01:26:51.834,"Now, Turner in the Bronx has got a tire shop, and Huey Lucas, in Bergen County, has a body shop."
01:26:51.875,01:26:53.458,Is there a manager here?
01:26:53.500,01:26:55.667,That's my price.
01:26:55.709,01:26:59.041,These businesses are the distribution and collection points...
01:26:59.083,01:27:02.166,for Frank's dope and Frank's money.
01:27:02.208,01:27:03.750,Everything about Frank's life...
01:27:03.792,01:27:07.667,"seems unpretentious, orderly and legitimate."
01:27:07.709,01:27:14.500,"He starts early, gets up at 5:00 a.m., has breakfast in a diner in Harlem every morning, usually by himself."
01:27:14.542,01:27:16.792,Then he starts work-- takes a meeting...
01:27:16.834,01:27:19.291,with an accountant or with his lawyer.
01:27:19.333,01:27:21.417,"Now, nights he usually stays at home."
01:27:21.458,01:27:23.792,"And if he does go out, it's to one of two clubs..."
01:27:23.834,01:27:26.208,"or a handful of restaurants, with his new wife."
01:27:26.250,01:27:29.750,Hangs with ballplayers-- It's fuckin' Wilt Chamberlain.
01:27:29.792,01:27:32.333,"friends, musicians, never, never with organized crime guys."
01:27:33.583,01:27:35.792,Sundays he takes his mother to church.
01:27:35.834,01:27:43.417,"Then he drives out and he changes the flowers on Bumpy's grave, every Sunday, no matter what."
01:27:43.458,01:27:46.458,"in the life of a dope man, Richie."
01:27:46.500,01:27:51.125,"No. Bumpy Johnson's life wasn't typical either, and he ran Harlem for years."
01:27:51.166,01:27:55.083,So you're saying that Frank Lucas replaced Bumpy Johnson?
01:27:55.125,01:27:57.125,His driver?
01:27:57.166,01:28:00.250,Sounds a little far-fetched.
01:28:00.291,01:28:03.417,"Because everything he does-- He's handing out turkeys, man."
01:28:03.458,01:28:05.667,he does the same as Bumpy would have done.
01:28:05.709,01:28:07.125,And who was Bumpy most likely to teach?
01:28:08.667,01:28:10.834,The guy he sees every day.
01:28:10.875,01:28:13.208,It's like a Sicilian family.
01:28:13.250,01:28:16.959,He structured his organization to protect him in the same way.
01:28:17.000,01:28:23.959,"And if he was with Bumpy for so long, that means he would have spent a lot of time with Italians, definitely long enough to learn that much."
01:28:24.000,01:28:25.875,But here's the thing.
01:28:25.917,01:28:28.792,I don't think it's Frank Lucas that we're after.
01:28:28.834,01:28:33.875,"Who we want is whoever Frank Lucas is working for, whoever's actually bringing the heroin in."
01:28:33.917,01:28:39.583,Okay. So what do you have on him that will stick in court?
01:28:39.625,01:28:41.083,Because this isn't it.
01:28:42.709,01:28:45.834,"Without powder, without informants, no one's going to jail."
01:28:45.875,01:28:47.917,"That's understood, sir."
01:28:47.959,01:28:51.250,"And I don't think we're gonna get informants, not from inside the family."
01:28:51.291,01:28:54.625,"You know, unless we get very, very lucky."
01:28:56.917,01:28:58.583,All right.
01:28:58.625,01:29:00.000,Oh!
01:29:02.375,01:29:03.834,What's he done there?
01:29:48.792,01:29:50.959,Okay.
01:29:55.583,01:30:00.291,"Lord, we thank you for this food we're about to receive, the nourishments of our bodies."
01:30:00.333,01:30:02.417,Feed our souls with heavenly grace...
01:30:02.458,01:30:05.625,in Jesus' name and for his sake. Amen.
01:30:05.667,01:30:07.000,Amen.
01:30:25.959,01:30:27.500,"Shh, shh. Hey."
01:30:27.542,01:30:29.875,It's okay.
01:30:29.917,01:30:33.458,Come on.
01:30:33.500,01:30:36.458,"You better get yourself ready, old man."
01:30:36.500,01:30:38.083,"Come on, big man."
01:30:38.125,01:30:39.959,"Get yourself ready, old man."
01:30:40.000,01:30:42.375,All right.
01:30:42.417,01:30:44.083,Your pop said you had an arm on you.
01:30:44.125,01:30:46.792,"I'm gonna set your ass in the grass, Uncle Melvin."
01:30:46.834,01:30:49.041,"Watch your mouth, boy."
01:30:49.083,01:30:51.834,"I'm a pitcher, not an outfielder."
01:30:51.875,01:30:54.083,Steve.
01:30:55.041,01:30:56.750,Go on. Sit down.
01:30:56.792,01:30:59.625,Uncle Frank.
01:30:59.667,01:31:02.625,How you doing?
01:31:02.667,01:31:05.333,You want a drink?
01:31:05.375,01:31:06.709,Just checking.
01:31:08.834,01:31:12.792,"Why didn't you show up for that meeting, Steve, hmm?"
01:31:12.834,01:31:15.959,I set it up with the Yankees and Billy Martin.
01:31:17.625,01:31:19.500,Why didn't you show up?
01:31:20.917,01:31:23.542,I-- Don't lie to me.
01:31:24.959,01:31:26.834,I don't wanna play ball no more.
01:31:26.875,01:31:28.542,I decided.
01:31:28.583,01:31:30.959,What you talking about?
01:31:31.000,01:31:32.625,That ain't what I want.
01:31:32.667,01:31:35.041,You've been playing since you was a little boy.
01:31:35.083,01:31:36.834,You ready to go into the pros.
01:31:35.083,01:31:39.959,What you-- Frank.
01:31:41.417,01:31:42.792,What'd you want?
01:31:45.125,01:31:47.375,"I want what you've got, Uncle Frank."
01:31:47.417,01:31:49.041,I wanna be you.
01:32:32.583,01:32:34.208,My man.
01:32:35.583,01:32:37.959,"Welcome, Frank."
01:32:38.000,01:32:40.500,It's all great.
01:32:40.542,01:32:43.208,Need to talk to you.
01:32:45.709,01:32:47.417,"everybody's good, Nick."
01:32:47.458,01:32:54.000,"Everybody's happy-- Charlie, Baz, the Italians, Johnny Law-- Everybody's happy except you."
01:32:54.041,01:32:57.500,I don't understand why you gotta take something that's perfectly good...
01:32:57.542,01:32:59.542,and mess it up.
01:32:59.583,01:33:02.458,"See, brand names."
01:33:02.500,01:33:04.959,"Bottoms up, baby!"
01:33:05.000,01:33:06.750,"Go ahead, Frank."
01:33:06.792,01:33:09.166,I'm sorry about that bullshit.
01:33:09.208,01:33:12.125,Blue Magic.
01:33:12.166,01:33:14.875,Like Pepsi.
01:33:14.917,01:33:17.792,I stand behind it.
01:33:17.834,01:33:19.792,They know that even if they don't know me...
01:33:19.834,01:33:22.542,any more than they know the chairman of General Mills.
01:33:22.583,01:33:24.917,What the fuck are you talking about?
01:33:24.959,01:33:28.750,"When you chop my dope down to one, two, three, four, five percent..."
01:33:28.792,01:33:33.333,"and then you call it Blue Magic, that is trademark infringement."
01:33:33.375,01:33:35.291,You understand what I'm saying?
01:33:35.333,01:33:39.125,"With all due respect, Frank, if I buy something, I own it."
01:33:39.166,01:33:42.417,"If I buy a car and I wanna paint it, I can paint the motherfucker."
01:33:42.458,01:33:45.333,"But you don't have to, Nick."
01:33:45.375,01:33:48.917,You can make enough money off it the way it is just by calling it Blue Magic.
01:33:48.959,01:33:50.917,"Anything more than that is greed, son."
01:33:50.959,01:33:52.917,Want me to change the name on it?
01:33:52.959,01:33:55.083,I would have to insist that you change the name.
01:33:55.125,01:33:57.083,"Fine by me, Frank."
01:33:57.125,01:33:59.041,Even though that don't sound as good.
01:33:59.083,01:34:00.750,I don't give a fuck what you call it.
01:34:00.792,01:34:03.834,Put a choke hold on the motherfucker and call it Blue Dog Shit.
01:34:03.875,01:34:06.583,I don't care.
01:34:08.417,01:34:11.542,Catch me?
01:34:11.583,01:34:15.000,I don't like these words as much as please.
01:34:15.041,01:34:17.709,"Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you, Nicky."
01:34:17.750,01:34:20.542,You come in my motherfucking club without an invitation.
01:34:22.125,01:34:24.000,My man.
01:34:31.542,01:34:33.250,"Oh, shit."
01:34:33.291,01:34:35.166,"Fuck, is that the cops there, man?"
01:34:44.250,01:34:45.959,It's all right.
01:34:46.000,01:34:48.041,"What the hell they gonna do, give us a ticket?"
01:34:49.792,01:34:52.000,"Stuff's in the car, Frank."
01:34:53.458,01:34:54.917,What?
01:34:54.959,01:34:56.208,Some of it's in the trunk.
01:34:58.458,01:35:00.208,"How you doing, Frank?"
01:35:00.250,01:35:02.250,"How you doing, Detective?"
01:35:02.291,01:35:04.959,"Not so good, as a matter of fact."
01:35:10.750,01:35:12.667,Give me the fuckin' keys.
01:35:12.709,01:35:13.959,"The Shelby's gone, Frank."
01:35:14.000,01:35:15.291,Shelby's gone?
01:35:15.333,01:35:16.625,"Yes, sir."
01:35:17.959,01:35:20.125,Got anything worth looking at in here?
01:35:20.166,01:35:22.250,"Hey, that's that Trupo guy."
01:35:22.291,01:35:23.625,Is that him?
01:35:23.667,01:35:25.000,Fucking prick.
01:35:26.250,01:35:28.041,Whoa!
01:35:28.083,01:35:30.250,"Come over here a minute, Frank."
01:35:32.542,01:35:34.250,What we gonna do about this?
01:35:34.291,01:35:35.500,We ain't gotta do shit about it.
01:35:35.542,01:35:37.250,Close it up.
01:35:37.291,01:35:39.792,"Everybody go home, have some pumpkin pie, warm apple cider."
01:35:39.834,01:35:42.041,"Well, I got a better idea."
01:35:42.083,01:35:45.375,Or would you rather me throw you and your brother in the fuckin' river?
01:35:45.417,01:35:48.041,Or would you rather your house blows up next time?
01:35:48.083,01:35:49.500,Hmm.
01:35:53.417,01:35:56.083,I loved that car.
01:35:58.917,01:36:00.083,What's he doing?
01:36:00.125,01:36:02.041,Shakedown!
01:36:02.083,01:36:03.917,Somebody's getting some money for the Benevolent Fund.
01:36:03.959,01:36:05.625,Look at that shit.
01:36:05.667,01:36:07.125,"Sorry, Frank."
01:36:07.166,01:36:09.333,It's all right.
01:36:33.125,01:36:35.750,"All right, you call me back."
01:36:37.792,01:36:41.500,"INS, IRS, FBI-- I can't get a damn thing out of any of them."
01:36:41.542,01:36:43.792,Because they all think you're on the take.
01:36:43.834,01:36:47.041,And you think they are.
01:36:47.083,01:36:49.333,"You know, I don't think they want this to stop."
01:36:49.375,01:36:58.875,"I think it employs too many people-- judges, lawyers, cops, politicians, prison guards, probation officers."
01:36:58.917,01:37:03.208,"They stop bringin' dope into this country, about 100,000 people are going to be out of a job."
01:37:14.583,01:37:16.667,What the fuck is a microwave?
01:37:16.709,01:37:20.208,"It's a scientific force, like atomic energy."
01:37:20.250,01:37:22.166,Yeah?
01:37:22.208,01:37:24.375,It rearranges the molecules.
01:37:24.417,01:37:27.542,Of what?
01:37:29.709,01:37:30.959,Of your head.
01:37:31.000,01:37:33.000,Stick it in.
01:37:35.250,01:37:38.041,I can get you one of those.
01:37:38.083,01:37:39.875,"Brand-new, just like this."
01:37:39.917,01:37:41.208,I'll have it delivered.
01:37:41.250,01:37:43.000,"No, thank you."
01:37:52.625,01:37:55.041,"Hey, where's that?"
01:37:55.083,01:37:56.834,Aspen.
01:37:56.875,01:37:58.291,Had a great time.
01:37:58.333,01:38:00.583,You know who we met?
01:38:00.625,01:38:02.667,Burt Reynolds.
01:38:02.709,01:38:05.083,Yeah?
01:38:05.125,01:38:06.792,Yeah?
01:38:06.834,01:38:09.375,A lot of people from Hollywood go up there now.
01:38:09.417,01:38:10.667,They're buying up everything.
01:38:10.709,01:38:12.500,This is your place?
01:38:12.542,01:38:14.583,You know what that's worth?
01:38:14.625,01:38:18.458,"Ski in, ski out, five bedrooms, sauna, everything."
01:38:18.500,01:38:20.959,We were guests.
01:38:24.458,01:38:26.333,It's your place.
01:38:41.208,01:38:43.250,Isn't there something we can do...
01:38:45.250,01:38:47.125,about leaving the big guy alone?
01:38:48.667,01:38:50.458,You know who I mean.
01:38:50.500,01:38:54.166,"I don't report what you just said, I could get in a lot of trouble."
01:38:54.208,01:38:56.375,"I do report it, and the trouble is yours."
01:38:58.583,01:39:01.250,I'm hoping you won't do that.
01:39:02.583,01:39:05.291,"Richie, come on."
01:39:05.333,01:39:07.125,How do you know?
01:39:08.500,01:39:11.000,And I'm telling you.
01:39:11.041,01:39:12.959,From who? Your uncle?
01:39:16.125,01:39:19.166,Why would you do this?
01:39:19.208,01:39:20.542,Because...
01:39:22.750,01:39:25.250,I care what happens to you.
01:39:27.041,01:39:29.542,You shouldn't have done this.
01:39:29.583,01:39:31.333,I had to.
01:39:31.375,01:39:32.542,Neither do you.
01:39:32.583,01:39:34.458,You don't have a choice.
01:39:34.500,01:39:37.000,Just leave Frank Lucas alone.
01:39:38.417,01:39:39.875,Frank Lucas?
01:39:40.959,01:39:42.375,Yeah.
01:39:45.000,01:39:47.166,You tell Marie I had to leave. I'm sorry.
01:39:48.417,01:39:50.750,Tell her why.
01:40:33.083,01:40:34.750,Talk! Talk!
01:40:34.792,01:40:36.250,Are you Richie Roberts?
01:40:37.583,01:40:39.709,You've been served.
01:40:58.458,01:40:59.959,Laurie.
01:41:02.709,01:41:06.291,"Look, I'm sorry I never gave you the kind of life you wanted, all right?"
01:41:06.333,01:41:08.625,I'm sorry it was never enough.
01:41:11.917,01:41:14.667,Don't punish me for being honest.
01:41:14.709,01:41:16.583,Don't take my boy away.
01:41:18.709,01:41:22.542,What are you saying?
01:41:22.583,01:41:25.250,"and you didn't take money like every other cop, I left you?"
01:41:25.291,01:41:31.917,No. You don't take money for one reason-- to buy being dishonest about everything else.
01:41:31.959,01:41:33.875,And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about.
01:41:33.917,01:41:37.250,Shh. Shh.
01:41:37.291,01:41:38.875,"You know, I'd rather you took it..."
01:41:38.917,01:41:40.500,and-- and been honest with me.
01:41:40.542,01:41:42.208,Or don't take it.
01:41:42.250,01:41:43.667,"But then, don't go cheat on me."
01:41:42.250,01:41:45.959,Laurie-- Don't cheat on your kid by never being around.
01:41:46.000,01:41:47.959,Don't go out and get laid by your snitches...
01:41:48.000,01:41:49.750,and your secretaries and strippers.
01:41:49.792,01:41:52.750,"You know, I can tell by just looking she's one of 'em."
01:41:52.792,01:41:58.208,"You-- You think you're going to heaven because you're honest, but you're not."
01:41:58.250,01:42:02.250,You're going to the same hell as the crooked cops you can't stand.
01:42:02.291,01:42:04.208,All rise.
01:42:08.500,01:42:10.041,"Please, be seated."
01:42:11.834,01:42:18.834,"Miss Dickerson, before the court renders its opinion, is there anything else you'd like to be heard on?"
01:42:18.875,01:42:20.959,"Yes, Your Honor."
01:42:21.000,01:42:22.750,"Your Honor, a lot has been said here today..."
01:42:22.792,01:42:28.166,"about how unsavory Mr. Roberts's environment is for a child, how dangerous it is."
01:42:28.208,01:42:30.166,We tell him to protect us.
01:42:30.208,01:42:34.583,"We give him that responsibility, but then say, Oh, we don't trust you to raise a child."
01:42:34.625,01:42:36.291,We don't think you're fit for that.
01:42:36.333,01:42:37.667,I'm not.
01:42:38.542,01:42:39.917,You're right.
01:42:41.125,01:42:44.417,Being around me is no place for a kid.
01:42:44.458,01:42:46.166,You take him to Vegas.
01:42:46.208,01:42:48.208,I'll come see him when I can.
01:42:50.250,01:42:53.041,"Your Honor, I just wanna apologize for wasting the court's time."
01:43:05.667,01:43:07.458,Doc.
01:43:07.500,01:43:08.750,I see 'em.
01:43:08.792,01:43:10.625,There he is.
01:43:28.875,01:43:30.000,What the fuck is this guy doin'?
01:43:31.250,01:43:33.041,- Hey!
01:43:33.083,01:43:34.500,"Merry Christmas, Detectives."
01:43:34.542,01:43:35.709,For us?
01:43:37.417,01:43:39.083,"You fellas have a good time, all right?"
01:43:39.125,01:43:40.834,Mm-hmm.
01:43:40.875,01:43:42.417,Cristal.
01:43:46.917,01:43:48.834,The South Vietnamese troops called in air strikes...
01:43:48.875,01:43:51.125,on Communist positions inside the city.
01:43:53.375,01:43:56.250,"Paying off Johnny Law, that's one thing."
01:43:56.291,01:43:58.375,Ain't no problem with that.
01:43:58.417,01:44:03.542,"payin' off the police since I was 10 years old, puttin' more of their kids through college than the National Merit Award."
01:44:03.583,01:44:05.417,"Give me one of them round ones, yeah."
01:44:05.458,01:44:09.333,This is different though.
01:44:09.375,01:44:12.709,That's their problem.
01:44:12.750,01:44:15.041,No code of ethics.
01:44:15.083,01:44:16.875,Looks great.
01:44:16.917,01:44:19.750,Good.
01:44:19.792,01:44:21.583,"But the police, that's ain't the only somebody I'm worried about."
01:44:21.625,01:44:25.875,"See, I'm seeing cars where I ain't never seen 'em before, people I don't know."
01:44:25.917,01:44:27.834,"Ho, ho, ho."
01:44:27.875,01:44:30.375,Aw.
01:44:30.417,01:44:31.875,"Merry Christmas, Charlie."
01:44:31.917,01:44:34.291,Mmm. I love you.
01:44:34.333,01:44:36.291,Mm-hmm.
01:44:36.333,01:44:38.291,"Here, take this."
01:44:38.333,01:44:40.166,Quick toast and then I'll be off.
01:44:47.750,01:44:49.667,We're gonna have a great time.
01:44:49.709,01:44:52.625,"That's right, chica."
01:44:53.750,01:44:55.250,It's all clear.
01:44:58.667,01:45:01.375,Who is that?
01:45:01.417,01:45:02.917,It's your boy Nicky.
01:45:02.959,01:45:04.125,"Yeah, I see him."
01:45:04.166,01:45:06.834,Just keep going.
01:45:06.875,01:45:08.542,Around back?
01:45:08.583,01:45:10.917,"Hell, no."
01:45:10.959,01:45:12.917,Incredible.
01:45:12.959,01:45:15.083,Huh?
01:45:34.834,01:45:36.208,Come on.
01:45:40.333,01:45:41.709,"Hold on, hold on."
01:45:49.041,01:45:50.750,What?
01:45:50.792,01:45:52.417,I want to wait in the car.
01:45:52.458,01:45:54.834,"Frank, I got it. I got it."
01:45:54.875,01:45:56.458,I got it.
01:45:56.500,01:45:58.583,"Get that yellow sauce, all right?"
01:45:58.625,01:46:00.625,And the chicken.
01:46:06.041,01:46:07.959,Can you turn the heater on?
01:46:14.125,01:46:15.625,Shit.
01:46:15.667,01:46:17.333,I'm gonna go get the keys.
01:46:30.333,01:46:32.000,"Doc, give me the keys."
01:46:32.041,01:46:33.750,Here you go.
01:46:38.834,01:46:39.834,Doc!
01:46:44.250,01:46:45.250,Get out.
01:46:52.583,01:46:55.000,You okay?
01:46:55.041,01:46:56.750,Shit. Come on.
01:46:56.792,01:46:58.417,"Come on, baby."
01:46:58.458,01:47:01.041,Let's go.
01:47:22.083,01:47:23.834,Was it Nicky?
01:47:25.709,01:47:27.917,We'll go right now and fuckin' kill him whether it was him or not.
01:47:27.959,01:47:29.417,"You say the word, Frankie."
01:47:30.875,01:47:32.333,"We gotta do something, Frank."
01:47:33.500,01:47:34.834,We can't just sit here.
01:47:34.875,01:47:36.208,We're leaving.
01:47:38.792,01:47:40.500,All right.
01:47:40.542,01:47:41.875,"You all right, man?"
01:47:43.500,01:47:44.667,It's Christmastime.
01:47:44.709,01:47:47.917,Go on. Y'all go ahead.
01:47:47.959,01:47:49.291,Go ahead.
01:48:02.000,01:48:05.375,"Where we gonna go, huh?"
01:48:05.417,01:48:07.333,Come on. Sit down.
01:48:08.834,01:48:12.208,"Frank, we can go anywhere we want."
01:48:12.250,01:48:14.000,"No, we can't."
01:48:14.041,01:48:15.625,"And do what, run? Hide?"
01:48:15.667,01:48:18.458,"Frank Lucas don't run from nobody, baby."
01:48:18.500,01:48:21.375,We ain't going nowhere.
01:48:21.417,01:48:24.250,This is my home.
01:48:21.417,01:48:27.083,"This is where my business is, my wife, my mother, my family, my country."
01:48:27.125,01:48:28.834,I ain't going nowhere.
01:48:29.959,01:48:33.250,I ain't running from nobody.
01:48:33.291,01:48:35.125,This is America.
01:48:41.917,01:48:43.667,And you ain't going nowhere either.
01:48:46.208,01:48:47.208,Huh?
01:48:49.834,01:48:55.041,"A cease-fire, internationally supervised, will begin at 7:00 p.m."
01:48:52.500,01:48:56.917,"this Saturday, January 27, Washington time."
01:48:56.959,01:48:58.333,Call you back.
01:48:58.375,01:49:01.083,"Within 60 days from this Saturday-- Hey, hey, hey."
01:49:03.375,01:49:04.750,Richie.
01:49:07.792,01:49:09.208,Wow.
01:49:11.875,01:49:17.125,"So, from what I hear it was the Corsican mob took a shot at Frank."
01:49:17.166,01:49:21.375,"You know, French Connection, Fernando Rey, the exporters that Frank has put out of business."
01:49:22.709,01:49:25.291,"Look, I can take care of him in New York."
01:49:25.333,01:49:30.125,"I just don't wanna have to worry that every time he drives across the bridge to Jersey, someone's gonna take another shot at him."
01:49:31.333,01:49:34.333,"Richie, you and I gotta start working together."
01:49:34.375,01:49:37.500,We need to step up our efforts.
01:49:37.542,01:49:40.333,"Next time, their aim could be better."
01:49:40.375,01:49:43.125,We need to keep this cash cow alive.
01:49:49.208,01:49:50.959,What the fuck are you doing here?
01:49:51.834,01:49:53.208,Whoa.
01:49:56.291,01:49:59.291,Were you actually gonna arrest Frank Lucas?
01:49:59.333,01:50:01.792,What's the matter with you?
01:50:01.834,01:50:03.500,No.
01:50:03.542,01:50:07.000,Everybody in New Jersey's crazy.
01:50:07.041,01:50:08.709,You know what we do here?
01:50:08.750,01:50:11.125,Cops arrest bad guys.
01:50:12.375,01:50:18.208,"Before you get on that bridge again, you should call me first, just to make sure it's safe."
01:50:20.625,01:50:22.959,I'm more enlightened than some of my friends.
01:50:23.000,01:50:25.125,I can guarantee you peace of mind.
01:50:25.166,01:50:27.083,"That's what you told me, Dominic."
01:50:27.125,01:50:28.291,I can...
01:50:28.333,01:50:30.834,guarantee you peace of mind.
01:50:30.875,01:50:32.542,I don't feel so peaceful.
01:50:34.125,01:50:35.500,Huh?
01:50:37.917,01:50:40.583,They tried to kill my wife!
01:50:44.375,01:50:46.917,Who was that? Huh?
01:50:48.250,01:50:50.500,Maybe it was one of your peoples.
01:50:50.542,01:50:51.750,I don't know yet.
01:50:51.792,01:50:53.083,You don't know.
01:50:53.125,01:50:54.458,You don't know.
01:50:56.125,01:50:57.834,I tell you what I know.
01:50:57.875,01:51:00.417,Maybe I should just put 500 guns out there on the street...
01:51:00.458,01:51:02.667,and just start shooting up some people just to make a point.
01:51:02.709,01:51:05.166,"Frank, it was a junkie, right? It was a rival."
01:51:05.208,01:51:07.834,Some dumb-ass kid trying to make a name for himself.
01:51:07.875,01:51:09.750,Someone you forgot to pay off.
01:51:09.792,01:51:12.083,Someone you slighted without even realizing it.
01:51:13.250,01:51:15.166,Could be someone you put out of business.
01:51:15.208,01:51:18.166,For being so successful.
01:51:18.208,01:51:20.792,Success.
01:51:20.834,01:51:23.250,Lots of enemies. So...
01:51:23.291,01:51:25.583,your success took a shot at you.
01:51:25.625,01:51:29.208,What are you gonna do now?
01:51:30.500,01:51:33.375,"Frank, we can be successful and have enemies, right?"
01:51:33.417,01:51:35.250,We can be unsuccessful too.
01:51:35.291,01:51:37.166,"You know, we can have friends."
01:51:38.125,01:51:39.667,That's a choice we make.
01:51:41.792,01:51:45.208,The final evacuation of military and diplomatic personnel...
01:51:45.250,01:51:47.000,continued throughout the night...
01:51:47.041,01:51:49.792,as North Vietnamese troops marched on Saigon.
01:51:49.834,01:51:52.500,The imminent fall of the city has brought chaos...
01:51:52.542,01:52:05.083,and a growing sense of desperation-- Operator.
01:52:05.125,01:52:07.333,"Yeah, Bangkok-367, international."
01:52:07.375,01:52:09.208,"One moment, please."
01:52:17.834,01:52:18.917,Yeah. Nate.
01:52:18.959,01:52:21.083,"Hey, Frank, what's up, babe?"
01:52:21.125,01:52:23.333,What's going on over there?
01:52:23.375,01:52:26.083,"Yeah, I'm watching the news."
01:52:26.125,01:52:27.834,"The game's over, Frank."
01:52:27.875,01:52:30.542,It's done.
01:52:30.583,01:52:32.250,"Well, look, I'm not."
01:52:32.291,01:52:38.041,"I want 2,000-- I want 2,000 keys in the air."
01:52:38.083,01:52:39.333,"It's impossible, Frank."
01:52:39.375,01:52:41.000,All our resources are going home.
01:52:41.041,01:52:42.917,"Look, I'm on my way over there."
01:52:42.959,01:52:44.333,Right now?
01:52:44.375,01:52:55.792,"Oh, come on-- Spearman, wake the fuck up, man."
01:52:55.834,01:52:57.000,What?
01:52:59.250,01:53:01.875,"- Where's my shit, Caroline?"
01:53:04.125,01:53:06.125,- Jesus. Police!
01:53:06.166,01:53:08.667,"Drop the gun, Jimmy!"
01:53:08.709,01:53:11.041,Let me see your hands.
01:53:11.083,01:53:12.709,"I'm not fuckin' playing with you, Jimmy!"
01:53:12.750,01:53:15.041,Don't shoot!
01:53:16.291,01:53:19.625,"I got your gun, and I got your prints."
01:53:21.166,01:53:24.709,You know what you got?
01:53:24.750,01:53:27.875,Fifteen fuckin' years.
01:53:27.917,01:53:31.000,Attempted murder's the same as Murder One.
01:53:31.041,01:53:33.542,"Now, a grand jury could come back favorably."
01:53:33.583,01:53:36.458,It could be reduced to-- to manslaughter.
01:53:36.500,01:53:38.375,All right?
01:53:38.417,01:53:41.166,It all just depends on how we wanna deal with you.
01:53:41.208,01:53:42.834,"You see where this is fuckin' going, Jimmy?"
01:53:42.875,01:53:44.542,Let's say you beat it.
01:53:44.583,01:53:46.917,What do you think your cousin Frank is gonna think?
01:53:46.959,01:53:49.333,He is gonna know at some point in time...
01:53:49.375,01:53:51.792,we sat you down and we talked to you like this.
01:53:51.834,01:53:54.125,Then you go to court.
01:53:54.166,01:53:56.166,What's he gonna think?
01:53:56.208,01:53:58.125,Is your cousin Frank stupid?
01:53:58.166,01:53:59.500,Answer him!
01:53:59.542,01:54:01.166,No.
01:54:01.208,01:54:03.208,He's gonna assume that you talked.
01:54:05.625,01:54:08.625,"But right now, Frank doesn't know."
01:54:08.667,01:54:13.041,"You want Frank to read about this in the papers, or do you just want to walk out of here?"
01:54:13.083,01:54:17.542,"No bail, no trial, no jail, just walk out of here today."
01:54:17.583,01:54:19.583,Your choice.
01:54:29.583,01:54:31.333,Opium plants are hearty enough...
01:54:31.375,01:54:35.083,to outlive any war.
01:54:35.125,01:54:39.000,They'll still be here long after the troops have gone.
01:54:40.625,01:54:42.625,What are you going to do for transportation...
01:54:42.667,01:54:45.125,when the last U.S. plane goes home?
01:54:45.166,01:54:47.208,I'll think of something.
01:54:48.875,01:54:51.500,"You will see me again, that's for sure."
01:54:53.291,01:55:01.667,"It's not in my best interest to say this, Frank, but quitting while you're ahead is not the same as quitting."
01:55:44.333,01:55:46.583,- Yeah.
01:55:49.125,01:55:51.041,"Whatever you wanna do, baby."
01:55:51.083,01:55:52.792,Give me a second.
01:55:52.834,01:55:54.375,It's Frank?
01:55:56.166,01:55:57.250,Yeah.
01:55:57.291,01:55:58.709,Newark.
01:55:58.750,01:56:01.500,Short term.
01:56:01.542,01:56:03.875,Parking lot three.
01:56:03.917,01:56:06.000,"Short term, lot three."
01:56:06.041,01:56:07.959,"Yeah, that's the Mustang we talkin' about, right?"
01:56:08.000,01:56:09.417,"Okay, right."
01:56:09.458,01:56:15.750,K-A-- K-A-- 7-6-- Zero. All right.
01:56:17.208,01:56:19.333,There's no short term lot three at Newark.
01:56:19.375,01:56:21.417,"They got letters-- A, B, C, D."
01:56:21.458,01:56:24.250,I know.
01:56:24.291,01:56:26.166,This isn't no Jersey license plate.
01:56:26.208,01:56:29.333,"I mean, uh, nor New York, for that matter."
01:56:29.375,01:56:31.583,K-A-7-6-0.
01:56:31.625,01:56:32.709,Yep.
01:56:32.750,01:56:35.166,Kilo Alpha?
01:56:35.208,01:56:36.625,A plane tail number?
01:56:36.667,01:56:39.083,Kilo Alpha 7-6-0.
01:56:40.125,01:56:41.375,You check commercial planes.
01:56:41.417,01:56:43.000,You guys check the private planes.
01:56:43.041,01:56:44.959,"Everything, from a little fuckin' Cessna..."
01:56:45.000,01:56:47.500,"to the biggest fuckin' whatever, jet, all right?"
01:56:47.542,01:56:49.625,Check the military planes.
01:56:49.667,01:56:51.000,Sit-- Sit down.
01:57:14.333,01:57:16.208,Captain?
01:57:16.250,01:57:18.125,"Richie Roberts, Essex County."
01:57:18.166,01:57:20.125,I know you're expecting us.
01:57:20.166,01:57:22.625,Here's our warrant.
01:57:22.667,01:57:24.250,"Wait, wait."
01:57:24.291,01:57:26.458,"Scotty, stop all these soldiers."
01:57:26.500,01:57:27.959,Every one of them.
01:57:37.709,01:57:38.709,No-knock warrant.
01:57:40.959,01:57:42.083,Go ahead.
01:57:42.125,01:57:44.375,Where are they going?
01:57:44.417,01:57:46.625,"Ma'am, please sit down."
01:57:46.667,01:57:48.542,What is this?
01:57:48.583,01:57:50.625,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
01:57:50.667,01:57:53.750,"Hey, hey, hey, nothin' leaves this area, all right?"
01:57:53.792,01:57:55.583,Slow down with this.
01:57:55.625,01:57:58.750,"All right, stop these trucks."
01:57:58.792,01:58:01.458,Just pull it all down.
01:58:01.500,01:58:04.000,What is this?
01:58:04.041,01:58:06.834,"All right, Captain?"
01:58:06.875,01:58:08.709,We gotta look at the trucks.
01:58:08.750,01:58:10.625,"Read the warrant, sir."
01:58:10.667,01:58:13.166,Your husband's illustrious career is over.
01:58:14.875,01:58:17.959,Now the feds are gonna come in.
01:58:18.000,01:58:19.333,"I mean, they're gonna take it all."
01:58:19.375,01:58:22.834,But not before I get my gratuity.
01:58:22.875,01:58:25.750,So where's the money?
01:58:25.792,01:58:27.583,What am I talking about?
01:58:27.625,01:58:32.250,The getaway money that Frank and every other gangster keeps in his house.
01:58:32.291,01:58:35.333,"If you leave now, there's a chance Frank might not kill you."
01:58:36.917,01:58:38.875,D-- D-- You-- Shut up! Sit down!
01:58:38.917,01:58:40.125,Sit down!
01:59:21.166,01:59:23.417,Defense today announced the planned evacuation...
01:59:23.458,01:59:38.917,"of all remaining U.S. combat forces from Vietnam, news that comes too late for some, as here on a solemn tarmac at Dover Air Force Base, this C-130, loaded down with its sorrowful cargo-- a cargo of America's bravest and best..."
01:59:38.959,01:59:40.875,en route to their final resting places.
01:59:56.458,01:59:57.834,"You guys, take this coffin down."
02:00:06.375,02:00:08.583,Open it.
02:00:08.625,02:00:10.709,"Hey, shh, shh."
02:00:12.250,02:00:14.083,"Hey, hey. Shh."
02:00:14.125,02:00:16.959,"Great fuckin' dog, huh?"
02:00:17.000,02:00:19.583,"Hey, hey."
02:00:24.792,02:00:26.875,You stop this. Right now.
02:00:26.917,02:00:29.625,My warrant gives me permission to examine this plane.
02:00:31.083,02:00:32.834,The plane and its cargo.
02:00:32.875,02:00:34.709,"Well, you don't have my permission."
02:00:36.000,02:00:37.667,"I don't need it, Captain."
02:00:37.709,02:00:40.041,"Shh. Hey, hey, easy."
02:00:40.083,02:00:42.125,"Easy, boy."
02:00:42.166,02:00:44.917,"Frank, move out of the way."
02:00:51.917,02:00:53.000,Damn.
02:00:57.041,02:00:58.417,That's enough!
02:01:07.125,02:01:09.333,Stay with these coffins.
02:01:09.375,02:01:10.375,Got it. Okay.
02:01:11.667,02:01:13.250,"Hey, help me out with this."
02:01:38.291,02:01:40.333,That was a military transport plane.
02:01:40.375,02:01:46.542,"If there was heroin on board, then someone in the military would have to be involved, which means that even as it fights a war..."
02:01:46.583,02:01:51.250,"that's claimed 50,000 American lives, the military is smuggling narcotics."
02:01:51.291,02:01:56.000,That is how this event today will be interpreted-- that someone employed by this office...
02:01:56.041,02:01:57.542,believes that the United States Army...
02:01:57.583,02:01:59.291,is in the drug trafficking business...
02:01:59.333,02:02:02.458,and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains...
02:02:02.500,02:02:04.417,of young men who have given their lives...
02:02:04.458,02:02:06.542,in the defense of democracy!
02:02:06.583,02:02:08.625,- There is dope on that plane.
02:02:10.208,02:02:15.375,"Is it any wonder, then, that because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program..."
02:02:15.417,02:02:16.792,is now in jeopardy of being dismantled...
02:02:18.458,02:02:20.917,as completely and enthusiastically as that fuckin' transport plane?
02:02:20.959,02:02:23.792,"That is what you've accomplished, Mr. Roberts, single-handedly."
02:02:23.834,02:02:27.250,I had good information that the target of my investigation...
02:02:27.291,02:02:29.250,was bringing dope in on that plane.
02:02:29.291,02:02:31.333,And that target is?
02:02:31.375,02:02:33.417,- Who?
02:02:33.458,02:02:36.667,Who's Frank Lucas?
02:02:36.709,02:02:38.625,He's not Italian.
02:02:41.250,02:02:44.417,I-Is that supposed to be some kind of a joke?
02:02:44.458,02:02:48.500,"You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making fuckin' jokes?"
02:02:48.542,02:02:51.667,My investigation indicates...
02:02:51.709,02:02:55.166,that Frank Lucas is above the Mafia in the dope business.
02:02:55.208,02:02:57.166,My investigations also indicate...
02:02:57.208,02:03:00.917,that Frank Lucas buys direct from a source in Southeast Asia.
02:03:00.959,02:03:05.709,"He cuts out the middlemen, and he uses U.S. military planes and personnel..."
02:03:05.750,02:03:12.709,"to transport pure, number-four heroin into the United States, and he's been doin' so on a regular basis since 1969."
02:03:12.750,02:03:15.959,I have cases against every member of Frank's organization.
02:03:16.000,02:03:18.500,Frank's organization?
02:03:18.542,02:03:21.083,what the America Mafia hasn't in 100 years.
02:03:21.125,02:03:22.542,And you would know that how? Why?
02:03:22.583,02:03:24.709,'Cause your head is stuck up your fuckin' ass?
02:03:24.750,02:03:27.291,"Lou, do me a favor."
02:03:27.333,02:03:29.000,- Kike?
02:03:32.041,02:03:33.750,"Hey, Richie."
02:03:35.208,02:03:37.792,Make it stick.
02:03:37.834,02:03:39.625,Spearman's with the coffins.
02:04:10.125,02:04:11.792,Doctor.
02:04:13.375,02:04:14.959,What?
02:04:15.000,02:04:18.709,"Fuckin' Trupo came by the house, man."
02:04:33.542,02:04:36.500,Frankie.
02:04:36.542,02:04:39.542,"Please, sit down."
02:04:39.583,02:04:42.000,"Uh, will you please come back a little later?"
02:04:42.041,02:04:43.709,Thank you.
02:04:43.750,02:04:45.834,"Ma, I gotta go, all right?"
02:04:43.750,02:04:49.709,"Just a few words-- Listen to me. I got-- Please, sit down."
02:04:49.750,02:04:51.166,I been thinkin' about some things.
02:04:51.208,02:04:55.875,"You know, if you'd have been a preacher, your brothers would have been preachers."
02:04:55.917,02:04:59.208,"If you'd have been a soldier, they'd be soldiers."
02:04:59.250,02:05:02.125,"I mean, they all came here because of you."
02:05:02.166,02:05:04.458,"I mean, you called, and they came runnin'."
02:05:04.500,02:05:08.709,Right.
02:05:08.750,02:05:12.750,"Uh, they always expect you to know what's best."
02:05:12.792,02:05:17.000,But even they know you don't shoot cops.
02:05:18.959,02:05:21.000,Even I know that.
02:05:22.083,02:05:23.834,Eva knows it.
02:05:23.875,02:05:26.667,The only one who doesn't seem to know is you.
02:05:26.709,02:05:28.250,"All right, Ma."
02:05:28.291,02:05:29.792,I ain't gonna shoot nobody.
02:05:29.834,02:05:34.625,"I never asked you where all this came from, because I didn't wanna hear you lie to me."
02:05:34.667,02:05:37.125,I didn't want you to worry about it.
02:05:41.166,02:05:42.834,Don't do that.
02:05:44.333,02:05:50.208,Do you want to-- Do you wanna make things so bad for your family that they'll leave you?
02:05:50.250,02:05:51.917,No.
02:05:51.959,02:05:54.542,"No, I understand."

02:19:04.125,02:19:06.375,I was talking to my lawyers.
02:19:06.417,02:19:08.125,They said something to me.
02:19:09.959,02:19:13.834,Did you really find a million dollars in the trunk of a car...
02:19:13.875,02:19:14.917,and then turn it in?
02:19:14.959,02:19:16.375,Did you do that?
02:19:16.417,02:19:19.000,"You did that for real, huh?"
02:19:19.041,02:19:22.917,"Shit. You know Johnny Law got it, though, right?"
02:19:22.959,02:19:24.625,"Ain't no maybe about it, Mr. Richie."
02:19:24.667,02:19:27.333,You know he got it.
02:19:24.667,02:19:29.333,"You turned that money in, he took it, and you ain't get nothing for it, did you?"
02:19:29.375,02:19:31.000,Why you do that?
02:19:31.041,02:19:32.959,It was the right thing to do.
02:19:33.000,02:19:36.458,That's true.
02:19:36.500,02:19:38.625,"The question I have, the question I been askin' myself..."
02:19:38.667,02:19:40.208,"is, Would you do it again?"
02:19:41.375,02:19:43.250,That's a lot of money.
02:19:45.041,02:19:48.250,"Many car payments ago, many child support payments ago."
02:19:49.750,02:19:53.500,"So I said to myself, the onliest way to find out is to find out."
02:19:55.166,02:20:01.125,"Bribery, extortion, murder, racketeering."
02:20:03.041,02:20:04.375,Give me an address.
02:20:04.417,02:20:06.208,I'll make sure the car's there.

02:20:08.083,02:20:10.041,"No, thanks."
02:20:10.083,02:20:11.417,You sure?
02:20:13.125,02:20:15.709,"Come on, now, Richie."
02:20:15.750,02:20:17.583,Huh? You think that you better than them?
02:20:17.625,02:20:19.583,You ain't no better than none of them other cops.
02:20:19.625,02:20:22.959,"In fact, you the same as them."
02:20:23.000,02:20:27.208,Let me ask you this.
02:20:27.250,02:20:29.333,is gonna change anything on them streets?
02:20:29.375,02:20:33.041,Them dope fiends is gonna shoot it. They gonna steal for it.
02:20:33.083,02:20:35.875,Putting me in or out ain't gonna change one thing.
02:20:35.917,02:20:38.458,And that's the way it is.
02:20:38.500,02:20:41.625,"So what we got, Richie?"
02:20:41.667,02:20:44.959,We got that little snitch-ass driver from my brother.
02:20:45.000,02:20:47.291,You got a little bit of powder.
02:20:47.333,02:20:48.625,"You gonna need more than that, Richie."
02:20:50.208,02:20:54.333,"I got possession, supply, conspiracy, bribing a law officer."
02:20:54.375,02:20:56.542,I got people who'll attest to seeing you kill in cold blood.
02:20:56.583,02:21:00.083,"I got your offshore bank accounts, your real estate, your businesses."
02:21:00.125,02:21:02.291,All bought with money from heroin.
02:21:03.959,02:21:06.250,I got hundreds of parents of dead kids.
02:21:06.291,02:21:08.417,Addicts who OD'ed on your product.
02:21:08.458,02:21:10.792,And that's my story for the jury.
02:21:10.834,02:21:15.125,"This man murdered thousands of people, and he did it from a penthouse, driving a Lincoln."
02:21:15.166,02:21:17.041,"Aside from that, you got nothing to worry about."
02:21:17.083,02:21:19.625,"That's pretty good, but that's why we go to court, isn't it, Richie?"
02:21:19.667,02:21:21.208,'Cause I got witnesses too.
02:21:21.250,02:21:23.792,I got celebrities.
02:21:23.834,02:21:26.125,"I got Harlem, Richie."
02:21:26.166,02:21:28.667,"I took care of Harlem, so Harlem's gonna take care of me."
02:21:28.709,02:21:30.375,You can believe that.
02:21:30.417,02:21:32.083,"I got more than that, Frank."
02:21:32.125,02:21:35.417,I got a line of people wanting to testify against you...
02:21:35.458,02:21:37.417,that stretches out the door and around the block.
02:21:37.458,02:21:40.333,"You damaged a lot of lives, Frank."
02:21:40.375,02:21:41.875,I got the Mazzano crime family.
02:21:41.917,02:21:43.917,Remember those boys?
02:21:43.959,02:21:45.792,I ain't got nothing to do with no Mazzanos. Mazzanos ain't got nothing to do with me.
02:21:45.834,02:21:47.458,They got everything to do with you.
02:21:47.500,02:21:48.917,Know why?
02:21:48.959,02:21:53.333,"Because apart from the fact that they hate you personally, they hate what you represent."
02:21:53.375,02:21:55.542,I don't represent nothing but Frank Lucas.
02:21:55.583,02:21:58.792,You sure?
02:21:58.834,02:22:01.458,You represent progress.
02:22:01.500,02:22:04.792,The kind of progress that's gonna see them lose a lot of money.
02:22:04.834,02:22:09.375,"With you out of the way, everything can return to normal."
02:22:09.417,02:22:10.750,My man.
02:22:15.291,02:22:18.542,"You know what normal is to me, Richie?"
02:22:18.583,02:22:20.834,I ain't seen normal since I was six years old.
