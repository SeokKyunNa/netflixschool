00:02:04.415,00:02:07.710,mine was consumed by the presentation of her child.
00:02:10.588,00:02:12.841,I was a reflection of her as a mother.
00:02:16.636,00:02:23.226,It was an ever-present source of anxiety to prove that I was just as well-groomed as any white child.
00:02:23.309,00:02:36.322,"They would play, hair uncombed, no shoes, traces of everything they'd eaten smeared on their faces, completely happy and oblivious to any possible defects to their appearance."
00:02:36.865,00:02:39.534,"I, on the other hand, had to be fixed."
00:02:40.535,00:02:49.460,"Once a week: wash, conditioner, and hot comb, until my hair was straight enough to run her fingers through it without one snap, crackle, or pop."
00:02:49.544,00:02:50.378,Ow!
00:02:50.461,00:02:52.380,"That's your outside voice, Violet."
00:02:52.463,00:02:55.592,-But you're burning my head off. -No one likes a complainer.
00:03:01.264,00:03:06.060,"You deserve the world, and one day, you're gonna find a man who'll give it to you."
00:03:06.144,00:03:07.520,Like my daddy.
00:03:08.229,00:03:12.358,"No, Vi. There's not a man in the world who can give your mommy what she wants."
00:03:21.201,00:03:22.160,You scared of the water?
00:03:23.912,00:03:25.663,I bet I could hold my breath longer.
00:03:26.706,00:03:29.125,"Vi, I'm warning you."
00:03:30.543,00:03:32.253,Violet! Violet Jones!
00:03:32.962,00:03:34.088,Violet Jones!
00:03:42.847,00:03:44.849,What the hell happened to your hair?
00:04:00.365,00:04:02.116,Nappily Ever After.
00:04:50.957,00:04:55.128,"How could I sleep on such a special day? It's just... Where is it, where is it?"
00:05:08.349,00:05:10.643,"-Shh, Mom! Shh! -Sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:05:15.398,00:05:17.191,I told you one day your prince would come.
00:05:17.275,00:05:19.402,"You just missed a couple of carriages, that's all."
00:05:23.990,00:05:25.116,Dad is coming tonight.
00:05:28.911,00:05:31.456,"-Why? -It's my birthday party, Mom."
00:05:32.165,00:05:33.666,He's supposed to be there.
00:05:33.750,00:05:36.127,He lost that privilege when he lost his mind.
00:05:39.922,00:05:43.426,He quit selling insurance to become a male model.
00:05:43.509,00:05:44.761,Is that not insane?
00:05:45.636,00:05:48.723,"And I mean, what is he gonna model anyway? Depends?"
00:05:49.140,00:05:52.185,"If he had not left, I would have kicked him out."
00:05:57.565,00:05:59.150,-I'll try. -Thank you.
00:06:00.026,00:06:03.613,"So, does Clint still think the party's a surprise?"
00:06:03.696,00:06:06.282,"He's been calling my office, asking April for help..."
00:06:12.663,00:06:13.498,All right.
00:06:14.665,00:06:15.833,What do you think?
00:06:45.029,00:06:46.155,"Morning, baby."
00:06:47.698,00:06:49.075,"Happy birthday, beautiful."
00:07:08.469,00:07:10.096,I've got a little gift for you.
00:07:10.304,00:07:11.889,"Oh, not that little."
00:07:32.076,00:07:34.078,-I wanna get on top. -Yeah?
00:07:34.454,00:07:35.580,I wanna get on top.
00:08:00.354,00:08:03.608,"Oh, one of the big orthopedic guys, he's gonna take me to lunch."
00:08:03.691,00:08:05.818,-He's opening up a new sports clinic. -Oh?
00:08:05.902,00:08:09.489,And I think he might ask me to join him after my residency.
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.407,"That's excellent, Clint."
00:08:11.491,00:08:17.163,"Right? And then, of course, I am going to be taking my beautiful birthday girl out for a very special evening."
00:08:17.788,00:08:19.665,Sounds perfect.
00:08:19.749,00:08:24.378,"In two weeks, you are going to be looking at the hottest doctor in town."
00:08:24.462,00:08:27.298,"-Mm-hmm. -Mm, it is time to make moves."
00:08:27.924,00:08:29.217,"Yes, it is."
00:09:05.336,00:09:06.879,Violet Jones' office.
00:09:08.172,00:09:10.883,"-Morning, April. -Good morning, Violet."
00:09:10.967,00:09:12.927,-Happy birthday. -Thank you.
00:09:13.010,00:09:15.263,Doctor Conroy called to ask what your favorite flowers are.
00:09:15.346,00:09:17.932,"I told him violets, and gave him the number to A Blooming Business."
00:09:20.476,00:09:25.898,"Highs in the mid-70s, seven percent relative humidity, and a five percent chance of precipitation."
00:09:25.982,00:09:28.901,"Perfect. Tell the girls, lunch on the patio is on."
00:09:28.985,00:09:29.819,Okay.
00:09:35.408,00:09:37.285,She doesn't love what she sees.
00:09:38.286,00:09:40.955,"We cut to her date, waiting in the next room."
00:09:41.038,00:09:46.460,"He has front row tickets to a show, and according to his Rolex, they're late."
00:09:47.420,00:09:53.384,But our woman has found the answer: Long Live Red by Essential.
00:09:55.261,00:10:00.224,"She stands in the doorway, looking beautiful. She is perfect."
00:10:05.146,00:10:08.274,"Great lips, great night."
00:10:09.150,00:10:10.026,Great pitch.
00:10:13.654,00:10:18.909,"So, wait. If I'm not 90 pounds with injected lips, -I don't get a hot guy to ask me out? -Not going on a lot of dates, huh?"
00:10:18.993,00:10:20.995,"Well, I loved it, Violet. I loved it."
00:10:21.329,00:10:24.999,"But tomorrow, add some more details about your projected use of ad space."
00:10:25.082,00:10:25.916,-Okay? -Got it.
00:10:26.000,00:10:27.460,All right. Good job.
00:10:27.543,00:10:29.920,"Oh, are we calling it? I love it."
00:10:30.004,00:10:32.340,"No, but seriously, Vi, they got you in a little box."
00:10:32.423,00:10:34.884,"You got it dressed up so pretty, you think it's a condo."
00:10:35.635,00:10:36.886,Does that look like a rain cloud?
00:10:37.803,00:10:42.016,"Look, you should be doing some of them pimp spots, like Budweiser."
00:10:42.350,00:10:43.434,"You know, Home Depot."
00:10:43.517,00:10:46.312,-Viagra. -You would say that.
00:10:46.395,00:10:50.483,"When a black couple walks into your office to buy a house, who does your boss trot out to greet them?"
00:10:52.443,00:10:54.278,"See, I-- I don't-- I don't trot."
00:10:56.405,00:11:07.249,"Listen, I am very good at selling to the female market, -Are you sure that's not a rain cloud? -The weather report said no rain."
00:11:07.333,00:11:08.793,I checked twice.
00:11:09.168,00:11:11.545,"Anyway, after tonight..."
00:11:12.963,00:11:15.508,my career is gonna take a back seat...
00:11:16.258,00:11:19.512,because the doctor is about to be in.
00:11:22.139,00:11:24.850,-Gotta get ready. -I know. I gotta find something to wear.
00:11:25.893,00:11:28.813,"Oh, look at them! So cute!"
00:11:39.073,00:11:42.368,Mom? Call me back. I-- I can't get into my normal salon.
00:11:42.451,00:11:44.620,I need help. Call me as soon as you get this.
00:11:46.997,00:11:49.333,"Violet, he loves you for who you are."
00:11:49.417,00:11:51.127,Does your husband know about your Jewfro?
00:11:51.544,00:11:54.338,Because I have plenty of pictures of the two of us in college.
00:11:54.422,00:11:56.674,"Mom, I just called you at home."
00:11:58.050,00:12:01.178,"-Call me back. Where are you? -All right, all right, look."
00:12:01.262,00:12:03.723,I'm going to call my hairstylist and see if she can fit you in.
00:12:03.806,00:12:04.932,-Yeah. Yeah. -Okay?
00:12:05.015,00:12:06.183,"Uh, offer money."
00:12:06.434,00:12:09.311,"-All right, how much? -Fifty. One hundred."
00:12:09.395,00:12:11.689,Two hundred dollars to whoever has the next appointment.
00:12:11.772,00:12:13.357,-Okay. Just breathe. -Yeah.
00:12:16.777,00:12:18.279,"Hey, Lalisa, girl!"
00:12:32.501,00:12:36.505,"You want to blame me for making you look damn good, I'll take it. But this..."
00:12:37.423,00:12:38.591,This is all God's work.
00:12:40.885,00:12:43.471,But brothers love long hair.
00:12:49.226,00:12:50.936,What brothers want...
00:12:52.480,00:12:54.106,is a woman who's real.
00:13:05.534,00:13:07.077,"You know, it's rude to stare."
00:13:07.161,00:13:08.871,"Pay me five dollars, and I'll stop."
00:13:09.663,00:13:10.581,Excuse me?
00:13:10.664,00:13:13.334,You just paid Jackie $200 not to get her hair done.
00:13:14.835,00:13:16.045,"Sorry, no deal."
00:13:16.921,00:13:21.550,"You know, you can sponsor, like, six kids from Uganda with that money you're spending for hair."
00:13:22.176,00:13:24.261,"I'm sorry, where is your mother?"
00:13:28.015,00:13:31.393,"Make yourself useful. Go get Crystal some conditioner, okay?"
00:13:31.894,00:13:34.313,"Girl, she does whatever flies into her head."
00:13:34.730,00:13:39.109,My mama would have popped me good for running my mouth -and having hair looking that crazy. -Mm-hmm.
00:13:39.193,00:13:41.111,"Come on, let's get you washed up."
00:13:51.372,00:13:52.373,You okay?
00:13:52.832,00:13:53.791,I'm fine.
00:14:05.386,00:14:08.681,"Uh, excuse me, I need to be rinsed."
00:14:09.265,00:14:11.475,You have seven more minutes to condition.
00:14:15.771,00:14:17.022,"Now, please!"
00:14:28.117,00:14:29.159,Lalisa?
00:14:34.456,00:14:35.833,"Oh, shit."
00:14:42.923,00:14:45.551,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!"
00:14:45.634,00:14:47.303,"Okay, all right. Vi, calm down."
00:14:47.386,00:14:50.264,"All right, it's really not that bad, you know. We could comb it over."
00:14:50.347,00:14:52.683,-What happened? -I-- I just washed and conditioned her.
00:14:55.144,00:14:57.021,-You used relaxer. -What?
00:14:57.104,00:14:58.856,I used what Zoe handed me.
00:14:59.356,00:15:00.399,You!
00:15:00.774,00:15:02.026,You did this!
00:15:02.109,00:15:04.486,"-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mistakes happen. -This was no mistake!"
00:15:04.570,00:15:06.864,-Where the hell is her mother? -Her mother's not around.
00:15:06.947,00:15:08.365,"She's my daughter, I take responsibility."
00:15:08.449,00:15:10.534,That's your daughter? With that mop on her head?
00:15:12.411,00:15:14.038,but don't talk about my daughter like that.
00:15:16.373,00:15:52.368,"You can think whatever you want about me right now, but in a few hours, my man will be proposing to me, so I suggest you go to one of those thousand hair supplies on this block and buy me the best hair money can buy, I am surprised you're still doing her hair."
00:15:52.451,00:15:54.453,-Oh! -She looks gorgeous.
00:15:55.537,00:15:58.040,"Oh, that's just one of our little things we do."
00:16:00.125,00:16:01.210,"You're lucky, Vi."
00:16:01.293,00:16:03.337,Your grandmother hated doing your mom's hair.
00:16:04.338,00:16:07.216,She used to just send her outside with this... afro.
00:16:07.841,00:16:11.011,The boys on the block used to call her Willie Mays.
00:16:13.430,00:16:14.348,Mom!
00:16:22.648,00:16:25.359,"Thanks, Dad. Wait, you're not leaving."
00:16:25.442,00:16:27.027,"Clint's going to, um..."
00:16:28.153,00:16:30.990,"uh, make a toast, and I really want you here."
00:16:31.073,00:16:32.992,"Well, I have an early call tomorrow."
00:16:33.075,00:16:35.369,I just booked my first job: a big photo shoot.
00:16:35.452,00:16:36.954,"Oh, excellent!"
00:16:37.955,00:16:40.416,This is all still a little weird for me.
00:16:40.833,00:16:43.127,"Hey, enjoy your party."
00:16:43.210,00:16:44.169,"-Thanks, Dad. -Love you."
00:16:44.253,00:16:45.212,I love you.
00:16:47.423,00:16:48.424,"Good night, Richard."
00:16:56.140,00:16:57.057,You okay?
00:16:58.100,00:16:59.143,Never better.
00:17:06.358,00:17:10.612,"Ladies and gentlemen, if I could just have your attention for one minute, please."
00:17:12.573,00:17:18.620,"So, I've been asking myself, what do you get the perfect woman?"
00:17:19.955,00:17:28.047,You are as beautiful waking up in the morning It's unnatural how perfect.
00:17:29.298,00:17:34.553,"So, I kept coming back to that sense of... family."
00:17:41.101,00:17:43.937,"Oh, this is the happiest moment of my life."
00:17:53.322,00:17:54.281,What's this?
00:17:57.076,00:17:58.243,-Oh! -Oh!
00:18:14.760,00:18:19.181,And one that won't make a mess.
00:18:27.606,00:18:28.732,What's wrong with me?
00:18:30.943,00:18:32.861,There's nothing wrong with you.
00:18:33.737,00:18:36.281,"Clint didn't propose tonight, but he will."
00:18:39.076,00:18:43.789,"Now freshen up, pick up that mutt, and go back out there with a smile on your face."
00:19:06.854,00:19:08.063,You don't like the dog.
00:19:09.106,00:19:10.649,What's not to like?
00:19:13.652,00:19:15.863,Did something happen at the party?
00:19:16.655,00:19:19.032,"No, absolutely nothing happened at the party."
00:19:21.160,00:19:22.661,What's that supposed to mean?
00:19:24.705,00:19:26.707,"I was expecting a ring, Clint."
00:19:27.291,00:19:28.167,A ring?
00:19:29.585,00:19:30.794,Like an engagement ring?
00:19:30.878,00:19:31.837,Yes!
00:19:31.920,00:19:33.380,Why would you-- would you think that?
00:19:33.463,00:19:36.592,Why? We've been together two years.
00:19:38.510,00:19:40.095,You said tonight I'm perfect.
00:19:41.722,00:19:43.849,"Yeah, I did."
00:19:45.601,00:19:48.061,But that doesn't mean we're ready to get married.
00:19:48.145,00:19:49.438,"Yes, it does."
00:19:50.480,00:19:54.234,"I-- I want a husband, not a boyfriend."
00:19:55.527,00:19:58.697,"And a child, not a Chihuahua."
00:20:03.869,00:20:05.412,What is that supposed to mean?
00:20:05.495,00:20:10.042,"You know, I had to ask your assistant what your favorite flowers were."
00:20:10.292,00:20:12.753,Your favorite wine. Your favorite music.
00:20:12.836,00:20:13.670,So?
00:20:13.879,00:20:16.548,So? You're talking about getting married.
00:20:17.257,00:20:19.259,I don't even know you.
00:20:19.551,00:20:21.178,Of course you do!
00:20:21.803,00:20:23.639,No. I know you're beautiful.
00:20:24.014,00:20:30.896,"I know you're smart, and you dress right, you act right, you always say the perfect thing, but you never let your hair down."
00:20:31.480,00:20:34.274,"We go to a party, you don't dance. You don't drink."
00:20:34.358,00:20:38.445,"We've never just got buck wild in the shower, or just acted silly together."
00:20:39.404,00:20:43.700,"You never take a chance, Vi, because you've always gotta be perfect."
00:20:43.784,00:20:45.786,But 24/7 perfection is...
00:20:46.912,00:20:49.039,It's like being on a two-year first date.
00:20:54.127,00:20:55.128,"Oh, my God."
00:20:58.382,00:21:00.968,"You're never gonna marry me, are you, Clint?"
00:21:02.594,00:21:04.972,"Babe, come on, that's-- that's not what I said."
00:21:10.978,00:21:12.646,I think you need to leave.
00:21:13.313,00:21:15.107,Are you being serious right now?
00:21:15.399,00:21:18.068,I think we need to stop wasting each other's time.
00:21:18.151,00:21:24.241,"So, because I won't marry you at this moment, you're saying it's over?"
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.161,The first date has to end sometime.
00:22:53.580,00:22:55.624,Go to the bathroom!
00:22:56.333,00:22:57.584,Don't you have to go?
00:23:10.013,00:23:14.851,"Lola, go... to the bathroom!"
00:23:19.940,00:23:20.774,Yay!
00:23:42.087,00:23:44.047,"Okay, so, um..."
00:23:46.049,00:23:48.510,"-Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm fine."
00:23:48.593,00:23:50.512,"Is, uh, everything ready in the conference room?"
00:23:51.972,00:23:53.014,"Uh, Violet?"
00:23:58.353,00:24:02.107,"And we-- Then we go to our woman, and she has on lipstick."
00:24:02.649,00:24:06.361,"Uh, she has to put the lipstick on first, of course."
00:24:07.279,00:24:08.780,She puts on Long Live Red.
00:24:09.489,00:24:10.574,Um...
00:24:10.991,00:24:14.536,"Yeah, Long Live Red, and, um, then she comes out..."
00:24:15.370,00:24:16.204,Shit!
00:24:19.958,00:24:21.084,She comes out.
00:24:27.257,00:24:29.134,"She's beautiful, and, um..."
00:24:33.638,00:24:42.439,"So-- so what we're saying is all women are pretty, but you won't be perfect until you wear Long Live Red?"
00:24:42.939,00:24:43.815,Yes.
00:24:45.066,00:24:45.901,No.
00:24:46.568,00:24:47.736,Did I say perfect?
00:24:48.111,00:24:52.240,"'Cause that wouldn't be nice, or even fair, to call her perfect."
00:24:52.491,00:24:55.827,"I mean, she's beautiful, but she's much more than that."
00:24:55.911,00:24:58.288,"Much, much more than that."
00:24:58.371,00:25:01.833,Fine. Then she's in Phi Beta Kappa as well.
00:25:02.292,00:25:03.460,"-Right? -No, no, no, no, Bill."
00:25:03.543,00:25:05.962,I don't-- I don't think you're really seeing her.
00:25:06.046,00:25:10.133,"She is, um, way, way, way, way more than that."
00:25:10.217,00:25:13.678,"Still, we all want to fuck her, and that's really the point of the ad."
00:25:14.387,00:25:15.305,"Right, Violet?"
00:25:17.724,00:25:18.683,"Yeah, mm-hmm."
00:25:25.357,00:25:29.069,He... just doesn't want you on the account.
00:25:30.445,00:25:31.738,Alicia's gonna take over.
00:25:31.821,00:25:34.366,"I want you to take a few days, okay? Get your head straight."
00:26:27.544,00:26:30.505,I don't think that'll go very well with the turquoise dress.
00:26:31.590,00:26:34.801,"Oh, it's you. I guess you're right."
00:26:36.720,00:26:39.222,"-Ow! -Trust me, handcuffs would hurt worse."
00:26:39.306,00:26:42.058,"Now, take the dress out of your backpack and put it on the counter."
00:26:42.976,00:26:46.271,All the clothes have security tags. You would have been caught at the door.
00:26:47.439,00:26:51.401,"No, you wait for somebody else to set off the alarm first, then you walk through."
00:26:51.484,00:26:53.403,"Oh, so clearly you've done this before."
00:26:53.486,00:26:56.531,"I heard. Anyway, it was a birthday present from my mom."
00:26:56.615,00:26:58.199,For. For your mom.
00:26:58.283,00:27:00.619,And that doesn't make it right. Come on.
00:27:02.579,00:27:04.331,"Now, say thank you to the nice security guard."
00:27:08.501,00:27:10.587,"Ma'am, could you stop, please?"
00:27:12.213,00:27:15.925,"So lucky I don't believe in putting my hands on you, or you'd be laid out on this sidewalk."
00:27:16.009,00:27:18.053,"-I'm sorry! -Sorry doesn't cut it, Zoe!"
00:27:18.386,00:27:19.512,How did you even get here?
00:27:19.596,00:27:20.722,-The bus. -The bus?
00:27:22.057,00:27:25.185,"What gets you more excited, huh? Being arrested or being kidnapped?"
00:27:25.769,00:27:30.357,"-Answer me when I'm talking to you! -Look, I know what she did was wrong, but maybe it was a cry for help."
00:27:30.440,00:27:32.359,-What the hell is she crying about? -I don't know.
00:27:32.442,00:27:33.777,"All right, then, stay out of it."
00:27:33.860,00:27:37.864,"Excuse me, I was put in it the moment I was strip-searched by that security guard."
00:27:37.947,00:27:40.825,"I've earned the right to tell you, you don't know what's going on with her."
00:27:41.993,00:27:44.829,And in what world would I take advice about my daughter from you?
00:27:45.413,00:27:46.623,Let's go. Move it.
00:27:51.086,00:27:52.128,Stop it!
00:28:09.104,00:28:10.021,Wow?
00:28:10.480,00:28:11.648,Or wow!?
00:28:12.774,00:28:13.983,-Just... -Wow.
00:28:14.067,00:28:14.901,Yeah.
00:28:17.737,00:28:18.863,I think it's hot.
00:28:21.324,00:28:24.911,"I mean, I don't really know if it's you."
00:28:24.994,00:28:26.955,"You know, maybe you just want to keep it simple?"
00:28:27.038,00:28:29.249,"-Yeah, just be yourself. -Yeah."
00:28:29.332,00:28:30.542,And what would that be?
00:28:30.625,00:28:35.839,"The Anal-Compulsive Miss Perfect cut, or the-- the Not Fun, Never Spontaneous Weave?"
00:28:35.922,00:28:37.716,"I mean, I liked the weave. It was cute."
00:28:37.799,00:28:40.093,"Violet, I think you're being too hard on yourself."
00:28:40.301,00:28:42.262,This is me.
00:28:43.138,00:28:46.349,This is called fuck you hair. Says so right on the box.
00:28:47.142,00:28:51.646,I just wasted two years of my life on that asshole...
00:28:55.024,00:28:59.070,"...so we are gonna go out, and I am gonna get myself right."
00:29:03.074,00:29:07.245,"I mean, if you're really gonna do this, the carpet's gonna have to match the drapes."
00:29:07.328,00:29:08.163,Mm.
00:29:14.210,00:29:16.880,"I want to do this, I just don't know how."
00:29:17.130,00:29:18.882,-Just go with how you feel. -Yeah.
00:29:18.965,00:29:21.801,"I feel like I should be on a pole, and Floyd Mayweather's making it rain."
00:29:26.264,00:29:28.016,"-Oh, my God. -I think even God's laughing."
00:29:33.021,00:29:41.738,"If you leave now, I know you're just gonna feel stupid the rest of the night, but if you stay here, I promise you, I'll make you laugh a little bit."
00:29:41.821,00:29:43.698,Take as much time with her as you need.
00:29:44.199,00:29:46.618,"-Vi, we gonna hit the dance floor, girl. -You're leaving me?"
00:30:24.447,00:30:26.741,"Ooh, impressive!"
00:30:26.825,00:30:27.951,You're impressive.
00:30:28.284,00:30:29.911,Ooh!
00:30:33.414,00:30:34.290,Mm!
00:30:43.883,00:30:46.469,Your hair told me everything that I needed to know.
00:30:47.053,00:30:49.305,You're not afraid of anything.
00:30:49.639,00:30:50.807,"No, I'm not."
00:30:50.890,00:30:52.600,You love to take a chance.
00:30:52.684,00:30:54.477,"-Yes, I do. -Yeah."
00:30:56.896,00:30:58.815,-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. -No.
00:30:59.107,00:31:00.066,"No, I liked it."
00:31:00.483,00:31:02.068,-You liked it? -Yeah.
00:31:02.151,00:31:03.736,"You are a wild one, aren't you?"
00:31:03.820,00:31:05.029,"-Yeah. -Oh, shit."
00:31:06.281,00:31:08.616,"-Shock me, baby. Shock me. -Shock you? Okay."
00:31:08.700,00:31:09.617,-Shock me. -Yeah.
00:31:14.998,00:31:17.000,"No, no. Hold up. Safety cap there."
00:31:17.083,00:31:18.918,"-Yeah, you gotta open it. Mm-hmm. -There you go."
00:31:24.507,00:31:26.301,-Oh! -Ooh!
00:31:30.138,00:31:33.141,"-Ow! -Oh, no, it's-- it's-- erotic. It's fine."
00:31:33.349,00:31:37.395,"-You're bleeding. You're bleeding! -Oh, no, just-- Let me just sit up here for a second."
00:31:37.729,00:31:39.480,"Ah, no, it's fine. It's fine."
00:31:42.025,00:31:43.568,This is terrible.
00:31:43.818,00:31:47.405,"Uh, no, no, it's, uh... No, it's, uh..."
00:31:47.780,00:31:48.823,What was I saying?
00:31:51.951,00:31:53.995,I gotta-- I gotta go.
00:31:57.415,00:31:59.042,I'm barely even bleeding now.
00:32:22.106,00:32:27.987,"So, maybe he was just using me to get through his residency. I mean, it's obvious he was gonna have me waiting on him forever."
00:32:29.489,00:32:31.240,I had to move on with my life.
00:32:31.324,00:32:32.241,That's it?
00:32:33.201,00:32:36.245,"I mean, he didn't cheat on you? He didn't hit you nor nothin' like that?"
00:32:36.329,00:32:37.205,No.
00:32:38.081,00:32:39.666,But he hurt my feelings.
00:32:41.668,00:32:43.294,"I mean, he-- he broke my heart."
00:32:44.212,00:32:45.505,He hurt your feelings.
00:32:46.089,00:32:48.508,-Now you want to put a gun to his head? -Yeah.
00:32:53.179,00:32:57.308,"Now, you know, men and women, they're kind of like, uh, puzzle pieces."
00:32:58.226,00:33:02.814,"No two pieces alike, come in all different sizes, different shapes, in this puzzle, and..."
00:33:02.897,00:33:08.569,"But, when a piece does fit, well, when one piece goes into the other, the search is over."
00:33:08.820,00:33:12.031,"And you can even take 'em apart, but they still gonna fit."
00:33:12.115,00:33:14.242,Mm-hmm. You can believe that.
00:33:14.742,00:33:17.245,A fit is a fit is a fit.
00:33:24.752,00:33:28.131,Can you take me to Emory University Hospital?
00:33:28.923,00:33:29.757,For what?
00:33:31.009,00:33:32.969,I have to put the puzzle back together.
00:33:45.857,00:33:47.817,"Ow, shit!"
00:34:01.914,00:34:05.126,"Violet, what-- What are you doing here?"
00:34:05.960,00:34:08.337,Nothing. Forget you ever saw me.
00:34:08.421,00:34:11.716,"Hey, no, wait. Hey, come on. What's-- What's going on?"
00:34:16.929,00:34:19.223,It's called fuck you hair. You like it?
00:34:20.391,00:34:22.310,-Wow. -Your nurse needs you.
00:34:27.273,00:34:31.694,"Kandi's a doctor. I don't know what you're thinking, but she's-- You slept with her, Clint!"
00:34:39.452,00:34:41.245,"You're the one who asked me to leave, Vi."
00:34:41.746,00:34:44.749,"And you did, without even hesitating."
00:35:23.871,00:35:25.498,"Doctor, my ass."
00:35:54.986,00:35:55.987,Hmm.
00:39:36.957,00:39:38.042,Ooh...
00:40:05.861,00:40:06.862,"Oh, hey, baby."
00:40:07.196,00:40:09.949,"You know, I found something -that I think is-- -Mom."
00:40:10.032,00:40:11.409,-Mom. -What?
00:40:11.492,00:40:12.326,What?
00:40:20.126,00:40:21.210,Mommy.
00:40:26.382,00:40:27.258,Mom!
00:40:27.591,00:40:29.051,-Ah! -Mom!
00:40:37.560,00:40:39.562,"She's fine, same as always."
00:40:40.020,00:40:44.024,"Course, she's convinced you're a lesbian, by the way, so be prepared."
00:40:45.109,00:40:46.235,Thanks for coming.
00:40:46.444,00:40:50.364,"Vi, you really shouldn't be calling me for things like this anymore."
00:40:50.448,00:40:53.409,"Come on, Dad, do you even remember what you were angry at her about?"
00:40:56.787,00:40:58.247,"Well, what if I need you?"
00:41:08.048,00:41:10.634,It just shows off more of your pretty face.
00:41:11.385,00:41:14.346,I've worked so hard to be everything he wanted.
00:41:15.598,00:41:17.183,And it still wasn't enough.
00:41:19.435,00:41:21.020,I'm so tired.
00:41:22.313,00:41:24.899,"Of course you're tired, baby girl."
00:41:27.109,00:41:30.070,"Look, you think..."
00:41:31.197,00:41:33.449,that this is just something you did on a whim?
00:41:34.241,00:41:36.035,I think you've been building up to it.
00:41:36.118,00:41:39.580,"Now, I understand what you're going through probably better than anyone."
00:41:39.663,00:41:40.623,And you know what?
00:41:41.248,00:41:42.458,You gonna be okay.
00:41:42.875,00:41:44.251,We'll get this cleaned up.
00:41:44.502,00:41:46.212,You've just gotta soldier on.
00:41:47.171,00:41:50.674,"And, look, you've got the head for it."
00:42:30.673,00:42:32.841,"Can you just use the men's room, please?"
00:42:36.554,00:42:43.060,"Look, there are six women to every man waiting to use a public restroom, so there's an excellent chance that it will be empty."
00:42:43.143,00:42:44.895,Just leave me the hell alone.
00:42:58.826,00:43:01.537,"Sorry! Sorry, no, this isn't your fault."
00:43:05.583,00:43:07.376,I was incredibly rude.
00:43:09.420,00:43:10.379,I'm sorry.
00:43:11.463,00:43:12.631,That's a pretty scarf.
00:43:14.592,00:43:17.094,I am just so emotional lately.
00:43:17.177,00:43:23.726,"Well, if it means anything, I-- I thought I was gonna be engaged... last week."
00:43:25.060,00:43:29.106,"And I'm supposed to be at work today, and all I want to do is curl up under the covers."
00:43:36.989,00:43:41.410,"Oh, no, I'm not one to tell my personal business to strangers."
00:43:45.122,00:43:46.624,"No, what can it hurt, right?"
00:43:51.128,00:43:52.212,There you go.
00:43:59.720,00:44:00.929,Handle it.
00:44:01.597,00:44:08.228,"He's in the middle of dumping me, and at the same time, he's scared about how I'm gonna react."
00:44:08.687,00:44:12.691,"Am I gonna lose it, find a bridge, jump off?"
00:44:13.233,00:44:25.287,"I say, Baby, please, I've lost my job, I've lost my hair, I've lost my $1,200 implants in my left breast."
00:44:26.080,00:44:31.168,"If I can get over cancer, then I can get over your simple ass."
00:44:37.341,00:44:39.051,You don't have to do that.
00:44:39.635,00:44:40.678,Sneak out.
00:44:43.222,00:44:44.223,I'm Erika.
00:44:45.307,00:44:48.435,"You're new, but you have a right to speak up."
00:44:48.769,00:44:51.397,"No, I... I really don't."
00:44:51.480,00:44:54.733,"-Violet, it's okay. -No, it's-- it's-- it's not."
00:44:58.779,00:44:59.697,I... um...
00:45:04.952,00:45:10.708,"My boyfriend didn't give me a ring, and so, uh... I shaved my hair off."
00:45:13.210,00:45:24.096,"You guys are incredible, to be dealing with everything you're dealing with and still to have the courage to... to not feel sorry for yourselves."
00:45:26.807,00:45:29.601,I am so sorry for the misunderstanding.
00:45:33.313,00:45:40.112,"The first thing I asked my doctor when he told me I was gonna have to have chemo was, Am I gonna lose my hair?"
00:45:42.239,00:45:44.575,"So, let's see."
00:46:01.467,00:46:04.762,"You walk around like that, of course you're gonna get ignored."
00:46:07.097,00:46:09.057,"You gotta own it, girl."
00:46:09.516,00:46:10.517,Own it.
00:46:25.532,00:46:27.743,"-Wow! -You go, girl."
00:46:36.710,00:46:39.922,"In my six years here, I've got every account I've gone after."
00:46:40.881,00:46:43.592,"And, despite what happened, that includes Essential."
00:46:43.675,00:46:44.802,I deserve a shot.
00:46:44.885,00:46:48.806,"Yeah, Violet, you're my go-to girl for beauty accounts."
00:46:48.889,00:46:50.265,"I mean, that's your thing."
00:46:50.474,00:46:54.228,And you were g-- You are great at it.
00:46:54.645,00:46:57.689,"Well, let me prove I can be great at something else."
00:46:58.607,00:46:59.817,I want Amber Lite.
00:47:02.903,00:47:07.908,"Well, no offense, dear, but this is... That's the granddaddy."
00:47:09.368,00:47:15.082,"You know, when I said to get your head right, this isn't really what I had in mind."
00:47:15.624,00:47:17.835,Are you sure that you don't need more time?
00:47:17.918,00:47:19.378,"Bill, I am fine."
00:47:20.629,00:47:24.633,I just don't want anything that has to do with beauty right now.
00:47:25.592,00:47:26.510,Please.
00:47:33.475,00:47:34.476,Fine.
00:47:38.188,00:47:46.154,"But if I am not blown away by what you come up with, then we go back to the old Violet. All the way back."
00:47:46.697,00:47:48.073,-Deal? -Deal.
00:47:48.282,00:47:49.116,All right.
00:47:52.244,00:47:54.121,"Oh, my gosh."
00:47:54.204,00:47:57.416,"Vi, I thought Common made bald sexy, but he ain't got nothin' on you."
00:47:57.499,00:47:59.251,"-You like it? -Yes, you look so good!"
00:47:59.334,00:48:00.419,-You look bomb. -Really?
00:48:05.299,00:48:07.885,Waking up in the morning and not having to worry about your hair.
00:48:07.968,00:48:08.802,Yes.
00:48:08.886,00:48:12.389,"I am so used to looking at myself in the mirror all the time, and now I never do."
00:48:12.472,00:48:17.853,It's only when I catch somebody's reaction that it all comes back.
00:48:18.979,00:48:21.690,But we are not here to talk about hair.
00:48:21.773,00:48:24.318,Y'all are here to help me come up with a beer commercial.
00:48:24.401,00:48:25.485,Okay.
00:48:25.569,00:48:26.612,"Now, look around."
00:48:27.362,00:48:28.322,What do you see?
00:48:28.447,00:48:31.116,Uh... Guys drinking.
00:48:35.203,00:48:37.080,"Yeah, guys screaming at the TV."
00:48:41.418,00:48:44.212,"You know, I hate beer commercials, to be honest."
00:48:44.296,00:48:46.006,"I mean, they're so sexist."
00:48:46.632,00:48:48.050,"Do something different, Vi."
00:48:48.258,00:48:49.927,"Yes. Hear, hear."
00:48:50.010,00:48:50.844,Right?
00:48:51.386,00:48:52.429,Hmm...
00:49:39.810,00:49:41.103,"Hello, Zoe."
00:49:44.106,00:49:47.484,Is that my fault too? 'Cause it doesn't look bad. I mean...
00:49:47.859,00:49:49.736,you don't have any dents or nothin'.
00:49:51.822,00:49:53.949,I brought you a birthday present.
00:49:54.783,00:49:56.493,My birthday isn't for two weeks.
00:49:56.576,00:49:58.870,Okay. Never mind. I'll just return it.
00:49:59.371,00:50:00.831,I actually have the receipt.
00:50:01.415,00:50:02.249,Wait.
00:50:10.298,00:50:11.800,Why would you get this for me?
00:50:11.883,00:50:13.093,'Cause I felt like it.
00:50:16.179,00:50:17.180,Try it on.
00:50:25.480,00:50:28.692,"Yeah, right, except for my body and my hair."
00:50:29.860,00:50:31.069,Why would you say that?
00:50:31.445,00:50:32.612,You did.
00:50:34.322,00:50:38.368,"Zoe, don't ever let someone's negative opinion of you become your reality."
00:50:38.994,00:50:41.079,You are a beautiful girl.
00:50:41.163,00:50:42.581,You just need a few tips.
00:50:43.081,00:50:44.666,My dad won't let me perm my hair.
00:50:44.750,00:50:46.835,He says the chemicals go right to your brain.
00:50:46.918,00:50:48.503,You don't need to do that.
00:50:49.212,00:50:51.298,"Now, just walk across the porch."
00:50:57.012,00:50:58.096,"Okay, stop."
00:50:58.638,00:51:00.307,See how your right foot is angled out?
00:51:00.974,00:51:03.101,Try to walk with your feet straighter.
00:51:04.895,00:51:06.104,Stand up straighter.
00:51:06.646,00:51:07.689,Hold your head up.
00:51:07.856,00:51:09.983,"Look at that, you just grew two inches!"
00:51:20.452,00:51:21.453,Mm-hmm.
00:51:22.746,00:51:25.373,"Could this be from my mom, for my birthday?"
00:51:26.416,00:51:27.501,From?
00:51:27.918,00:51:32.380,"Sometimes she forgets, and my dad just gets all sad for me."
00:51:35.967,00:51:36.843,Sure.
00:51:42.933,00:51:44.309,But my mom never let me.
00:51:45.727,00:51:47.646,Maybe I could draw some on your head.
00:51:54.319,00:51:55.362,What's going on?
00:51:58.448,00:52:00.867,"-...sorry for just stopping by. -No, no, no."
00:52:00.951,00:52:03.286,It's... quite all right. I'm glad you did.
00:52:03.912,00:52:06.289,I haven't heard Zoe laugh like that in a long time.
00:52:08.917,00:52:09.960,"-Yeah. -Sweet, too."
00:52:10.043,00:52:10.877,Thanks.
00:52:13.630,00:52:14.881,I owe you an apology.
00:52:15.715,00:52:20.053,"I kind of went at you the last time, and you were just trying to help, I don't want you to think I'm an asshole."
00:52:20.137,00:52:23.557,"I wasn't exactly in top form the first time we met, either."
00:52:24.015,00:52:25.684,So you do think I'm an asshole.
00:52:29.604,00:52:31.773,I'm making my famous pineapple chili.
00:52:32.315,00:52:34.151,Maybe that will change your opinion.
00:52:35.652,00:52:39.573,"Thanks, but, um, I have a lot of work to do."
00:52:39.656,00:52:42.075,"Oh, come on, you can't work on an empty stomach."
00:52:42.450,00:52:44.161,And I'm sure Zoe would love it.
00:52:48.790,00:52:51.459,"You know, but, honestly, real talk..."
00:52:51.960,00:52:54.421,Didn't the hum of the clippers...
00:52:55.088,00:52:57.299,sound like Harriet Tubman calling you to freedom?
00:52:57.382,00:53:00.051,"Yeah, but she lost her voice when I woke up."
00:53:03.430,00:53:06.933,"So, what are... What are all these plants for?"
00:53:07.017,00:53:08.101,They're my dad's.
00:53:08.310,00:53:09.144,Really?
00:53:09.227,00:53:11.605,Yeah. I use 'em to make shampoos and stuff.
00:53:11.938,00:53:12.856,Oh?
00:53:12.939,00:53:18.612,"You see, most women, they tell you that they get their hair relaxed because it's more manageable."
00:53:19.029,00:53:21.907,But anybody's hair is manageable if you got the right products.
00:53:21.990,00:53:25.744,"Now, my products, they take away those excuses."
00:53:26.286,00:53:27.162,Excuses?
00:53:27.245,00:53:28.538,"Yeah. I mean, look."
00:53:28.622,00:53:30.874,"What, we make up 12% of the population, right?"
00:53:30.957,00:53:34.711,"But yet, we buy 70% of all wigs and weaves."
00:53:35.003,00:53:36.046,What does that say?
00:53:36.630,00:53:38.381,Mm... We hate our hair?
00:53:39.883,00:53:47.807,"Ever since your mamas drug you into the shop, You know, I swear, I feel like a vet putting down an animal."
00:53:47.891,00:53:50.477,"You know, you hate to do it, but it's part of the job."
00:53:50.560,00:53:54.147,I'm just trying to change the world one head at a time.
00:53:56.816,00:53:59.611,"You know, I tell her every day she's beautiful."
00:53:59.694,00:54:06.034,"You know, but I'm battling TV, commercials, magazines, telling her that long, straight hair is what makes you beautiful."
00:54:06.117,00:54:10.080,"Well, I make some of those commercials, and you can't just put the blame on us."
00:54:10.163,00:54:11.873,"I mean, we're just reflecting society."
00:54:11.957,00:54:13.708,"Hell, anybody can reflect society."
00:54:13.792,00:54:16.002,How about reflecting what society should be?
00:54:16.086,00:54:18.588,"I have to please my clients, just like you."
00:54:18.672,00:54:20.632,"I didn't make the social rules, I just live by 'em."
00:54:20.715,00:54:21.675,Till now.
00:54:21.758,00:54:23.426,Are you guys arguing again?
00:54:24.636,00:54:25.637,Again.
00:54:25.720,00:54:27.222,"Yes, actually."
00:54:27.305,00:54:28.431,Oh...
00:54:32.852,00:54:34.312,Do we really have to listen to this?
00:54:34.396,00:54:36.940,"I mean, I got my own problems. Why do I need to hear--?"
00:54:37.023,00:54:38.692,"Hey, quiet down, young 'un."
00:54:39.651,00:54:43.029,"Okay? When you're feeling low, songs like this send you to church."
00:54:43.113,00:54:44.656,-Amen. -Amen.
00:54:47.450,00:54:49.202,"So, what do you got on your playlist?"
00:54:50.912,00:54:51.746,My playlist?
00:54:52.247,00:54:53.290,Yeah.
00:54:56.960,00:54:58.128,"Uh, 1+1."
00:55:12.017,00:55:13.184,Let me find it.
00:55:13.268,00:55:14.561,"No, just sing it."
00:55:14.644,00:55:15.687,What? No.
00:55:19.441,00:55:20.900,I don't even know the lyrics.
00:55:23.987,00:55:26.156,You wanna talk about sad? That's my voice.
00:55:28.033,00:55:29.993,"Okay, you don't have to-- You don't have to sing."
00:55:30.076,00:55:31.828,Just-- just say the words.
00:55:32.203,00:55:34.247,You know what? We won't even watch you.
00:55:35.582,00:55:37.125,We won't even watch.
00:55:46.301,00:55:51.806,"I'm a black mermaid, nothing rarer you will find."
00:55:52.891,00:55:54.559,I am here for you to love me.
00:55:55.185,00:55:57.062,I've been here for all of time.
00:55:57.270,00:55:58.104,Mm.
00:56:23.046,00:56:24.964,"Damn, that's a sad-ass song."
00:56:26.007,00:56:27.634,And you really can't sing.
00:56:42.941,00:56:44.317,I see you doin' the math.
00:56:44.818,00:56:45.652,What math?
00:56:46.528,00:56:47.904,"Okay, let's see."
00:56:49.072,00:56:53.743,"He's got a bunch of plants, plus he makes his own shampoos."
00:56:54.327,00:56:56.329,"Plus he's a hairdresser, but..."
00:56:58.123,00:56:59.541,he's got a daughter.
00:57:00.417,00:57:03.503,And I see him flirting with all the women in the shop.
00:57:04.045,00:57:05.880,"So, what does it add up to?"
00:57:06.256,00:57:07.549,"So, what's the answer?"
00:57:09.843,00:57:11.594,Let me take you out this weekend.
00:57:11.678,00:57:12.929,Someplace special.
00:57:41.666,00:57:43.751,"-What? -Oh, my God..."
00:57:52.760,00:57:56.848,"I mean, it's not enough that he leaves me, he's got to embarrass me too?"
00:57:59.350,00:58:01.186,He... looks nice.
00:58:01.895,00:58:04.355,He looks like a geriatric porn star.
00:58:04.439,00:58:08.359,"I mean, people are gonna think that I've been subjected to that all these years?"
00:58:08.443,00:58:10.069,"I mean, what are they gonna say?"
00:58:10.153,00:58:11.821,That you're a very lucky woman.
00:58:11.905,00:58:13.364,"Watch your mouth, Violet."
00:58:15.450,00:58:17.785,This craziness has just got to stop.
00:58:17.869,00:58:20.205,Maybe it's just a-- a midlife thing.
00:58:21.456,00:58:23.666,It's been going on for three months.
00:58:28.296,00:58:29.547,Where are you going?
00:58:29.631,00:58:30.590,To dinner.
00:58:32.675,00:58:34.511,Are you and Clint back?
00:58:34.594,00:58:35.428,No.
00:58:35.637,00:58:38.014,Oh. I guess you made sure of that.
00:58:39.474,00:58:42.644,"Look, I have to meet at 6:00, and it's 5:30, so..."
00:58:42.727,00:58:44.562,You're meeting this man?
00:58:46.940,00:58:48.525,"Violet, it is a man, right?"
00:58:48.608,00:58:50.693,"-Mom. -Well, doesn't he have a car?"
00:58:50.777,00:58:51.903,I'm sure he has a car.
00:58:52.320,00:58:53.821,I just want to keep it casual.
00:58:54.030,00:58:57.367,"And anyway, it's more about his daughter needing a female role model."
00:58:57.450,00:58:58.451,He has a daughter?
00:58:59.035,00:59:00.495,I have to finish getting ready.
00:59:00.578,00:59:01.454,No.
00:59:07.502,00:59:08.711,"Oh, my God."
00:59:14.300,00:59:16.219,I am so overdressed.
00:59:16.302,00:59:18.471,"No, no, no, no, don't worry about it. You look great."
00:59:18.555,00:59:19.806,Thanks for coming.
00:59:21.808,00:59:23.351,I'll be right back.
00:59:24.269,00:59:25.520,What? Where you goin'?
00:59:26.896,00:59:28.565,"Violet, you-- you look great."
00:59:43.121,00:59:44.872,I thought it was a plain T-shirt.
00:59:44.956,00:59:46.958,There's no such thing as a plain T-shirt anymore.
00:59:59.053,01:00:02.390,"Thought it'd be nice to do something easy, take the pressure off."
01:00:04.601,01:00:05.852,What can I get you guys?
01:00:06.561,01:00:07.562,Um...
01:00:09.439,01:00:11.482,"I'll have the garden salad, please."
01:00:12.650,01:00:20.491,"I'll have a Mo' Better Burger with cheese, uh, some French fries, and a chocolate banana shake."
01:00:21.576,01:00:24.662,Wait. I'm sorry. Can I get what he's getting?
01:00:24.746,01:00:26.789,"Yeah, sure. $27.50."
01:00:28.666,01:00:30.960,"You know, good call. I don't like to share my food."
01:00:31.044,01:00:32.003,Mm-hmm.
01:00:34.922,01:00:37.008,"So, weren't you about to get hitched?"
01:00:41.638,01:00:44.390,You can't get to know a person unless you ask questions.
01:00:47.560,01:00:48.936,He didn't want to marry me.
01:00:49.354,01:00:50.772,Why? What's wrong with you?
01:00:50.855,01:00:54.275,Apparently nothing. He said I was too perfect.
01:00:54.359,01:00:57.654,"Ah. Clearly, he hasn't seen you lose it in the beauty parlor."
01:00:59.989,01:01:01.866,You know the thing he said that hurt the most?
01:01:03.493,01:01:06.829,That being with me was like being on a two-year first date.
01:01:10.541,01:01:13.878,"Maybe you just weren't, you know, comfortable with the dude."
01:01:16.673,01:01:18.007,"So, where's Zoe's mom?"
01:01:18.966,01:01:20.051,Good redirect.
01:01:22.804,01:01:25.515,"Zoe's mom, how can I put this? Um..."
01:01:26.265,01:01:29.519,She thought being a mom was gonna be like a Huggies commercial.
01:01:30.395,01:01:33.564,"And when it didn't turn out that way, she broke out."
01:01:34.232,01:01:35.441,Does Zoe ever see her?
01:01:37.902,01:01:41.781,"She gets birthday cards, a present, when her mom remembers."
01:01:44.075,01:01:45.868,You're doing a great job with her.
01:01:46.369,01:01:48.162,Except for the hair terrorist act.
01:01:48.663,01:01:49.914,And the shoplifting.
01:01:51.708,01:01:53.876,"We laugh, but that was a real eye-opener."
01:01:55.336,01:01:58.756,"I like to think that I'm enough, you know, as a dad..."
01:02:00.425,01:02:04.929,"But Zoe, she... She really misses having a mom."
01:02:06.264,01:02:07.682,"Well, she has a good heart."
01:02:08.766,01:02:12.228,She just spends a lot of energy trying to hide it.
01:02:13.980,01:02:15.565,Sounds kind of familiar.
01:02:40.089,01:02:41.048,Look at that.
01:03:01.319,01:03:03.821,For the woman who wears it short and sexy.
01:03:05.156,01:03:07.241,It's my passion flower scalp rub.
01:03:10.787,01:03:12.914,Try it and tell me your honest opinion.
01:03:16.417,01:03:17.335,Come here.
01:03:18.377,01:03:19.212,Come.
01:03:22.465,01:03:23.508,Ah.
01:03:37.438,01:03:39.232,"Oh, that smells so good."
01:03:40.024,01:03:41.484,It's au naturel.
01:03:42.443,01:03:44.195,"In fact, you could eat the stuff."
01:03:48.282,01:03:49.367,Show me.
01:04:13.266,01:04:14.350,Mmm...
01:04:59.395,01:05:01.731,"Okay, a little bit. If you overwater them, they die."
01:05:01.814,01:05:02.648,Really?
01:05:17.038,01:05:19.707,"I'm proud of you, girl. But you should have got some by now."
01:05:19.790,01:05:22.084,"I mean, I can't believe y'all are still just hanging out."
01:05:27.214,01:05:30.217,I'm actually bringing him to my mother's Fourth of July party tomorrow.
01:05:30.468,01:05:31.427,Ooh!
01:05:31.510,01:05:32.845,Not at all the same.
01:05:33.387,01:05:39.393,"And your mama needs to stop calling that a Fourth of July barbecue, because I have not once seen a wing or a rib."
01:05:39.769,01:05:42.897,"Okay, are we really talking about a straight male hairdresser?"
01:05:46.025,01:05:49.570,-But he makes me... He makes me feel good. -Oh!
01:05:49.654,01:05:57.787,It'll actually be a welcome distraction because this will be the first time in 35 years that my dad won't be there.
01:05:58.079,01:06:00.331,Mm! I saw the ad.
01:06:00.831,01:06:03.376,A girl at my job had it hanging up at her desk.
01:06:03.459,01:06:04.627,Both pages.
01:06:08.464,01:06:10.216,"Yes, like Daddy."
01:06:10.299,01:06:14.804,"-Stop! Please stop! Please stop! -Ooh, yes, Daddy. Give it to me, Daddy."
01:06:20.893,01:06:23.479,And you're worried I ain't gon' pass the mama test.
01:06:23.854,01:06:25.564,"Well, you do keep saying ain't."
01:06:25.648,01:06:27.149,"Oh, it's like that now, is it?"
01:06:27.775,01:06:28.776,I'm good.
01:06:29.360,01:06:31.529,I'm good. Hit that bell.
01:06:37.743,01:06:40.705,"Ooh, it is about time."
01:06:40.788,01:06:45.084,The guests are eating the decorative nuts on my Independence Day collage.
01:06:45.167,01:06:47.461,"Sorry. Mom, this is Will."
01:06:47.878,01:06:49.338,"How do you do, Mrs. Jones?"
01:06:50.423,01:06:52.633,You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest.
01:06:53.217,01:06:54.593,Will brought these for you.
01:06:54.969,01:06:56.095,It's from my garden.
01:07:01.225,01:07:02.351,How unusual.
01:07:09.275,01:07:10.693,"Oh, Gerard!"
01:07:10.776,01:07:13.946,"I want you to meet my-- my daughter, Violet."
01:07:14.613,01:07:16.240,Oh. Hi.
01:07:17.033,01:07:21.787,"I'm sorry. I was just... I was looking at, you know, your old photos."
01:07:24.081,01:07:27.877,"I'm actually working in Senate these days, but law will always be my true love."
01:07:27.960,01:07:29.712,"Hey, how you doin', man? Will Wright."
01:07:29.795,01:07:32.298,How you doing? Oh! That's quite a handshake you got there.
01:07:32.381,01:07:33.632,You must work with your hands.
01:07:33.716,01:07:38.429,"Violet, would-- would you go and fix Gerard a drink, please?"
01:07:38.512,01:07:39.764,"What, his hand's broke?"
01:07:42.141,01:07:43.809,-That's very funny. -Mm-hmm.
01:07:44.351,01:07:45.644,Are you a comedian?
01:07:47.605,01:07:49.440,"Well, what is it that you do do?"
01:07:49.815,01:07:51.859,-I own-- -Will owns his own business.
01:07:52.443,01:07:53.402,My own business.
01:07:55.946,01:07:57.364,And how did the two of you meet?
01:07:57.448,01:07:59.200,-We met-- -We met professionally.
01:08:00.034,01:08:03.370,"Well, owning your own business, that does beat working for the Man."
01:08:04.038,01:08:05.122,Ain't that the truth?
01:08:05.623,01:08:06.665,"Isn't it, though?"
01:08:06.749,01:08:09.627,And isn't it wonderful to be successful?
01:08:10.628,01:08:11.629,"Yeah, that's right."
01:08:11.712,01:08:14.173,"So, anytime any of you need a cut, come on into my shop."
01:08:14.256,01:08:16.175,I just might take you up on that.
01:08:16.258,01:08:18.677,Think I could do one of those frohawks?
01:08:19.345,01:08:22.348,-Mm-mm. -You own a hair shop?
01:08:22.431,01:08:23.724,"Mom, it's a great salon."
01:08:23.808,01:08:25.434,"No, no, no. Shop is fine."
01:08:25.810,01:08:28.729,"And, yes, I do, Miss Jones, just like my mama before me."
01:08:29.939,01:08:32.274,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go pick up my daughter."
01:08:33.734,01:08:35.653,So this is the date with no car.
01:08:38.739,01:08:39.573,Will.
01:08:42.118,01:08:44.078,I was serious about the frohawk.
01:08:47.623,01:08:49.625,"Will, please wait a minute!"
01:08:51.418,01:08:52.419,I embarrass you now?
01:08:52.503,01:08:53.796,-No! -So what was that?
01:08:55.840,01:08:59.009,"You know, you're a cool sister, you really are, but..."
01:09:00.094,01:09:02.304,I don't know. I thought we had something.
01:09:02.388,01:09:03.222,So do I!
01:09:03.305,01:09:07.893,"But you seem to be mixed up about who I am and who you are, and a bunch of other important things."
01:09:07.977,01:09:11.689,"And seeing as how I have a daughter, I'm trying real hard not to fuck up."
01:09:12.148,01:09:14.900,I'm not in a position to be taking chances while you figure it all out.
01:09:18.696,01:09:20.030,Just get yourself sorted.
01:09:21.991,01:09:23.200,Have a happy Fourth.
01:09:51.979,01:09:54.648,"Hey, Violet, they're moving to the conference room."
01:09:54.732,01:09:55.608,Okay.
01:09:56.025,01:09:57.401,It's really great.
01:09:57.943,01:09:58.819,Thanks.
01:10:10.247,01:10:11.665,We're at Philips Arena.
01:10:12.166,01:10:19.465,"Hawks are playing the Cavs, and we push into four crazy loud, annoying guys in Cavs jerseys."
01:10:19.548,01:10:22.593,They're surrounded by rows of women in Hawks gear.
01:10:22.927,01:10:31.310,"Cavs are winning, and our four guys are standing up, cheering and annoying the hell out of a female fan sitting in front of 'em."
01:10:31.644,01:10:39.860,"Then, an Amber Lite vendor approaches, and the annoyed girl calls him over, orders four Amber Lites, and hands 'em to the guys behind her."
01:10:40.694,01:10:41.695,They're shocked.
01:10:42.154,01:10:47.368,"They sit down, clink their bottles, and enjoy the rest of the game silently."
01:10:47.952,01:10:53.916,"The girl in front smiles, turns to her friend, gives her a pound, and turns back to the game."
01:10:53.999,01:10:57.044,"A cut to a little later, our boys are depressed."
01:10:57.127,01:10:58.462,Their bottles are empty.
01:10:58.837,01:11:01.966,They look at each other and smile mischievously.
01:11:02.800,01:11:06.720,They stand up all at once and start screaming.
01:11:06.971,01:11:12.017,"This time, every girl around them starts waving over the Amber Lite vendor."
01:11:13.227,01:11:16.438,Amber Lite: It Does You Right.
01:11:20.609,01:11:22.987,"And, um, these friends, how do you see them?"
01:11:23.487,01:11:26.407,"Uh... Real women, no models."
01:11:26.490,01:11:28.951,I want each and every one of them to have their own unique vibe.
01:11:29.034,01:11:29.868,Okay.
01:11:30.577,01:11:36.166,"It's not the typical way to sell the product, but it is funny, and effective, and I think it could appeal to the male audience."
01:11:36.375,01:11:38.377,"-Thank you, Violet, thank you. -Good job."
01:11:38.460,01:11:40.796,"All right, Rich, you're up. What do you got?"
01:11:44.133,01:11:47.886,"We're on a cruise ship, and it's going down."
01:11:47.970,01:11:51.682,"All the life rafts are full, but there's still two guys left on the boat."
01:11:51.765,01:11:52.808,One is a stud.
01:11:52.891,01:11:54.643,The other is some corny-looking dude.
01:11:54.727,01:12:03.527,"But then these two gorgeous women, long blonde hair, big breasts, they float up in a life raft, and they call out that they can hold one more."
01:12:04.028,01:12:10.200,"And of course, the stud grins, and he pulls his shirt off, and he's got the pecs and the six-pack."
01:12:10.284,01:12:13.120,"But, to his shock, they point to the cornball."
01:12:13.662,01:12:18.208,And then we see why: The cornball is holding a six-pack of Amber Lite.
01:12:19.960,01:12:28.010,"We cut to later, and he's laying in the raft with the girls, all three drinking an Amber Lite, watching the stud go down with the ship."
01:12:31.221,01:12:32.598,"Thanks, Rich, nice."
01:12:33.307,01:12:34.183,Well.
01:12:37.311,01:12:38.395,Um...
01:12:39.897,01:12:41.565,I'm gonna go with Rich.
01:12:45.611,01:12:47.529,We've heard that pitch a thousand times.
01:12:47.613,01:12:49.531,"If it ain't broke, right?"
01:12:58.999,01:12:59.833,I quit.
01:13:00.250,01:13:01.168,Violet.
01:13:04.880,01:13:07.049,"Violet, one pitch. It's one pitch."
01:13:07.132,01:13:09.510,"Actually, I've been thinking about it for a while now."
01:13:10.344,01:13:12.763,I think it's time for me to step outside the box.
01:13:32.074,01:13:32.908,Hi.
01:14:59.828,01:15:01.872,What are you doing here?
01:15:02.206,01:15:06.335,"I'm sorry, I-- But, wow, that was... Wow."
01:15:06.418,01:15:07.252,Shut up.
01:15:07.628,01:15:08.712,You didn't see that.
01:15:09.296,01:15:12.216,"I saw nothing. I-- Wait, wait. No, wait."
01:15:12.883,01:15:13.926,"Yep, there it is."
01:15:14.801,01:15:16.386,Even better in slow motion.
01:15:18.222,01:15:19.973,Why have I never seen that?
01:15:20.432,01:15:21.767,Why are you here?
01:15:23.477,01:15:25.103,And what is that smell?
01:15:25.437,01:15:26.355,Uh...
01:15:27.773,01:15:37.658,"So, I came round to get the rest of my stuff, That, or very protective."
01:15:38.867,01:15:44.122,"So, yeah, I need to take a shower, 'cause I have just been here packing, and smelling of dog pee."
01:15:45.374,01:15:46.625,Be my guest.
01:15:47.209,01:15:48.377,Take a shower.
01:15:48.585,01:15:49.419,Thank you.
01:15:53.507,01:15:56.802,I'm sorry if I ever made you feel like something was wrong with you.
01:15:59.805,01:16:00.764,Maybe...
01:16:02.516,01:16:08.772,I just tried to find the fault in you because I was afraid that I was never gonna be enough for you.
01:16:10.566,01:16:12.526,"There's nothing wrong with you, Vi."
01:16:13.902,01:16:15.571,And I should have fought for you.
01:16:25.789,01:16:26.665,Right.
01:16:29.376,01:16:30.544,Gonna take that shower.
01:18:22.948,01:18:23.782,Hey.
01:18:24.449,01:18:25.325,Hey.
01:18:27.119,01:18:34.251,"Okay, so one of the things that I realized these past few months is how much you took care of me."
01:18:35.127,01:18:35.961,Sit.
01:18:38.338,01:18:41.675,"Now, enjoy your time."
01:18:41.967,01:18:43.051,Oh...
01:18:43.927,01:18:44.970,"Well, thank you."
01:18:48.140,01:18:49.516,You know what the funny thing is?
01:18:49.599,01:18:53.645,I've gained so much time not having to think about my hair.
01:18:53.729,01:18:55.439,"I mean, it was like a second job."
01:18:56.898,01:18:58.400,It's been really nice.
01:18:59.776,01:19:01.987,Does that mean you're not gonna grow it back?
01:19:02.738,01:19:03.947,I don't know.
01:19:04.030,01:19:08.034,"I mean, I certainly don't like being dismissed or ignored, but..."
01:19:08.577,01:19:10.912,it's kind of forced me to give up my vanity...
01:19:12.330,01:19:14.583,and focus on other parts of myself.
01:19:16.209,01:19:19.212,"So, what happens when I walk through that door?"
01:19:23.633,01:19:25.510,I-- I don't-- I don't know.
01:19:33.268,01:19:34.144,Hey.
01:19:37.939,01:19:39.065,Don't cry.
01:19:41.067,01:19:42.903,"Oh, no. No, Violet."
01:19:42.986,01:19:44.821,This is... This is the onion.
01:19:59.586,01:20:01.630,Violet Jones.
01:20:08.720,01:20:10.222,Will you marry me?
01:20:16.978,01:20:17.938,Will you?
01:20:26.279,01:20:28.365,"Okay, so how long do we have to lose weight?"
01:20:32.702,01:20:33.620,Hello?
01:20:36.706,01:20:37.624,"Hi, Mom."
01:20:43.839,01:20:45.507,Does your dad help you with that?
01:20:59.646,01:21:00.730,Sir!
01:21:01.565,01:21:02.941,Nice work!
01:21:05.902,01:21:07.153,May I top you off?
01:21:07.737,01:21:09.489,"Yes, please."
01:21:17.205,01:21:19.749,So. Let's talk about this wedding.
01:21:20.500,01:21:21.751,What's it gonna cost me?
01:21:27.424,01:21:30.802,"You know, um, my engagement party is tomorrow night."
01:21:32.137,01:21:32.971,Oh.
01:21:33.054,01:21:38.727,"And, for some reason, I'm feeling a little nervous, maybe because I'm meeting Clint's parents."
01:21:39.644,01:21:40.979,You think you could come?
01:21:41.730,01:21:45.859,"You'd have to get dressed up, do hair, makeup, the whole works."
01:21:47.694,01:21:50.655,"-I'll take that as a yes. -Yes, yes, yes! Yes!"
01:22:07.881,01:22:08.882,Let me.
01:22:18.892,01:22:21.519,"Just need everything to be perfect tonight, you know?"
01:22:22.270,01:22:25.732,"Well, as long as you don't get any more surprise dogs, it'll be great."
01:22:29.444,01:22:30.695,-We good? -Mm-hmm.
01:22:34.157,01:22:35.367,That's it.
01:22:39.496,01:22:41.039,-Vi? -Mm-hmm?
01:22:41.122,01:22:43.583,Just wondering if you could do something with your hair tonight.
01:22:45.752,01:22:46.878,Like what?
01:22:47.295,01:22:49.506,"I don't know. Like, make it straight."
01:22:50.674,01:22:51.716,Why?
01:22:52.467,01:22:55.053,"Well, I think it looks great. I mean, you know that."
01:22:55.136,01:22:59.349,"Women do different things with their hair all the time, so it's not, like, a big ask, right?"
01:23:00.392,01:23:03.311,"I'm sorry, I just-- I just need everything to be perfect tonight."
01:23:05.313,01:23:06.189,Okay.
01:23:30.088,01:23:30.922,Dad.
01:23:31.923,01:23:32.799,This is Violet.
01:23:33.508,01:23:34.926,It's a pleasure to meet you.
01:23:44.894,01:23:45.895,Hello.
01:24:07.208,01:24:08.251,Hmm...
01:24:09.169,01:24:11.379,"What? So, who do you belong to?"
01:24:11.796,01:24:12.922,Who are you?
01:24:13.006,01:24:15.925,I'm the one paying for the bread you have in your hands.
01:24:16.092,01:24:18.219,"And you can keep this one, you touched it."
01:24:19.012,01:24:20.889,I'm Zoe. I'm Violet's friend.
01:24:21.306,01:24:23.725,"Really? Well, nice to meet you, Zoe."
01:24:23.808,01:24:25.602,What a pretty dress.
01:24:26.144,01:24:27.479,And your hair.
01:24:28.313,01:24:30.440,It's so unusual.
01:24:30.774,01:24:34.486,Does unusual mean good? 'Cause I know I look dope.
01:24:34.569,01:24:36.946,"Yes, you do."
01:24:37.197,01:24:40.158,"Violet had the idea for the flower, but my dad did the rest."
01:24:40.241,01:24:41.284,He's a hairdresser.
01:24:43.203,01:24:45.622,"-Well, aren't you lucky? -Mm-hmm."
01:24:46.081,01:24:49.250,These? So good. Try one.
01:24:49.584,01:24:50.460,"No, thanks."
01:24:50.835,01:24:52.629,"Oh, come on, I know you want some!"
01:24:52.712,01:24:55.173,"Excuse me, you're using your outside voice."
01:24:55.256,01:24:57.550,"Excuse me, but we are outside."
01:24:59.636,01:25:04.265,"So, why don't you just get a soda to... wash all that down?"
01:25:08.144,01:25:09.604,I don't believe you.
01:25:09.687,01:25:12.273,You invited the hairdresser's daughter?
01:25:12.649,01:25:15.193,"I mean, does Clint know about you and her father?"
01:25:17.112,01:25:18.446,Beautiful ladies.
01:25:18.530,01:25:19.405,Ready to sit?
01:25:20.240,01:25:22.117,"Sure, um, can you give me a minute?"
01:25:22.200,01:25:23.034,"Yeah, sure."
01:25:23.451,01:25:24.327,Shall we?
01:25:36.923,01:25:38.049,Ooh.
01:26:07.078,01:26:08.204,Have you seen Violet?
01:26:09.247,01:26:10.081,No.
01:26:10.915,01:26:11.791,Okay.
01:26:12.834,01:26:13.960,I'll be back.
01:26:14.419,01:26:15.545,Excuse me a moment.
01:26:21.050,01:26:21.968,Hey.
01:26:23.178,01:26:24.262,You okay?
01:26:30.310,01:26:33.563,"But if I don't put them on, I won't be perfect, so I'm stuck here."
01:26:37.483,01:26:38.735,Isn't that sad?
01:26:40.612,01:26:42.655,Zoe would just go out there barefoot.
01:26:43.489,01:26:46.868,"Ten years old, and she already has the guts to just be who she is."
01:26:47.202,01:26:48.119,But I don't.
01:26:48.203,01:26:49.078,Violet.
01:26:50.121,01:26:51.206,Stop being dramatic.
01:26:51.289,01:26:53.166,"Now, there are people out there waiting for you."
01:26:55.627,01:26:59.923,"So you're okay with that, for me to just go out there any which way?"
01:27:00.215,01:27:01.674,What is your point?
01:27:03.676,01:27:08.723,"When I was ten, we went to some company picnic for Dad at some... park..."
01:27:10.016,01:27:12.518,and I jumped into the pool. Do you remember that?
01:27:12.602,01:27:13.561,"Oh, Lord, I..."
01:27:14.771,01:27:19.525,"My hair turned into a little fist, and all the kids were laughing at me."
01:27:21.236,01:27:25.657,"You yanked me out of the pool, shoved me into the car, and we left."
01:27:26.741,01:27:27.700,And?
01:27:29.452,01:27:35.583,I wonder who I would be if you had just hugged me and told me I was still beautiful.
01:27:42.340,01:27:44.634,You wouldn't be marrying Clint.
01:27:52.225,01:27:56.896,"You taught me how to be the girl the guy wants, but not the girl I want."
01:27:58.064,01:28:00.817,Uh... What does that mean?
01:28:15.373,01:28:16.416,It means...
01:28:18.209,01:28:19.794,I want to go for a swim.
01:28:26.050,01:28:28.177,A swim? Violet! Violet!
01:28:37.353,01:28:38.646,"Violet, don't you dare."
01:28:57.707,01:29:00.668,"Come in, everybody, the water is fine!"
01:29:05.381,01:29:06.382,Zoe!
01:29:08.885,01:29:11.804,What the hell. I'm flashing like a stop light.
01:29:12.472,01:29:16.642,"You know, Margaret, I don't believe I've been in a pool in 50 years!"
01:29:20.688,01:29:23.441,"-Hey! -Richard, what the hell are you doing? No."
01:29:25.693,01:29:28.571,"Get off of me. No. Oh, my God. No!"
01:29:36.746,01:29:39.707,What is the matter with you? What the hell are you thinking?
01:29:40.708,01:29:45.004,I think you have never looked so beautiful.
01:29:48.633,01:29:50.760,After everything you put me through?
01:29:53.554,01:29:54.389,No.
01:30:48.276,01:30:52.697,"In the past couple years, there's been a huge cultural shift towards what's natural and real."
01:30:52.780,01:30:59.954,"We've seen it in the growth of natural foods, the demand for eco-friendly cars, to just about any product you can imagine."
01:31:00.830,01:31:05.793,Will wants women to change the way we are thinking about our hair.
01:31:06.169,01:31:11.966,"He wants us to know that there is beauty in our natural hair, regardless of what type of hair we have."
01:31:12.049,01:31:16.721,"And his product line, YOU, helps us bring out that natural beauty."
01:31:18.389,01:31:23.352,But why would I push a product that totally undercuts what I'm already selling?
01:31:23.436,01:31:26.564,"Listen, women can wear weaves if they want to."
01:31:27.440,01:31:29.775,They can straighten their hair if they want to.
01:31:29.859,01:31:30.943,It's a choice.
01:31:31.027,01:31:32.737,There's nothing wrong with that.
01:31:33.404,01:31:37.200,But we also need them to know that there is beauty in their natural hair.
01:31:37.742,01:31:44.081,"Large grocery store chains didn't ignore the health food craze, they integrated it and kept their customers."
01:31:44.165,01:31:50.588,"The shift has already begun with hair and beauty, and women of color are one of the biggest markets there is for hair."
01:31:51.380,01:31:57.303,"Let us be the first to offer them something that protects, rather than destroys, their hair."
01:32:00.890,01:32:02.099,You were great in there.
01:32:02.517,01:32:06.395,"-Thank you. Your passion is an easy sell. -Not gonna lie, though."
01:32:06.479,01:32:10.775,"I didn't know what to expect, you know, with all your personal shit."
01:32:13.903,01:32:15.196,I guess that's fair.
01:32:16.614,01:32:18.991,But I keep my personal out of my business.
01:32:19.367,01:32:21.702,"I try to, but it doesn't always work like that."
01:32:23.287,01:32:28.584,"I'm still salty at you, so I kind of feel like I'm using you."
01:32:30.378,01:32:31.629,"I'm using you, too."
01:32:33.839,01:32:35.800,But you can't be salty at me forever.
01:32:38.219,01:32:39.262,Change the world?
01:32:40.763,01:32:41.931,One head at a time.
