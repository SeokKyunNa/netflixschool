00:00:45.795,00:00:48.631,but it was all over in just seven days.
00:00:49.299,00:01:00.143,"All that long, long time ago… none of the things we can see now-- the sun, the moon, the stars, the earth… the animals and plants-- not a single one existed."
00:01:00.393,00:01:04.814,Only God existed… and so only He could have created them.
00:01:05.106,00:01:06.691,And He did.
00:03:19.824,00:03:21.618,I wonder whatever became of him.
00:03:36.216,00:03:38.134,"Mr. Tuttle, your hair."
00:03:46.309,00:03:47.477,Yes?
00:03:47.602,00:03:52.607,"Good morning, ma'am. We've come about the-- Oh, yes, of course."
00:03:54.359,00:03:55.568,Come in.
00:03:57.111,00:03:59.155,I wasn't expecting you so soon.
00:04:07.288,00:04:08.539,You are…?
00:04:08.873,00:04:10.333,"I'm Bertha Mills, ma'am."
00:04:10.667,00:04:12.794,And this is Edmund Tuttle.
00:04:12.877,00:04:14.420,"Pleased to meet you, ma'am."
00:04:14.504,00:04:15.797,You must be the gardener.
00:04:16.589,00:04:18.258,That's right. The gardener.
00:04:18.633,00:04:21.928,And this young lady is called Lydia.
00:04:23.096,00:04:25.056,Have you had much experience in service?
00:04:25.139,00:04:27.934,"Oh, don't let that angel face fool you, ma'am."
00:04:28.643,00:04:30.186,She's older than she looks.
00:04:30.812,00:04:32.105,Can you iron?
00:04:37.485,00:04:40.321,"Uh… She can't talk, ma'am."
00:04:40.989,00:04:42.532,The poor little mite's a mute.
00:04:43.199,00:04:44.033,Oh.
00:04:44.200,00:04:46.911,"Oh, but she's a good little worker. I can promise you that."
00:04:48.121,00:04:49.330,All right.
00:04:50.081,00:04:52.417,"All right. The other girl I had spoke too much, anyway."
00:04:52.500,00:04:57.505,"Follow me. Mrs. Mills, you and the girl you will sleep in the attic room at the top of the stairs."
00:04:57.839,00:04:59.590,"And you, Mr…."
00:05:01.509,00:05:05.763,"Tuttle, you could sleep in the shed around the back."
00:05:06.639,00:05:11.561,"As you can see, the housework has been rather neglected… since the servants disappeared almost a week ago."
00:05:12.270,00:05:13.938,You mean they just vanished?
00:05:14.355,00:05:15.398,Into thin air.
00:05:16.149,00:05:18.818,"No notice, nothing. They didn't even collect their wages."
00:05:18.901,00:05:21.738,They… they just left us.
00:05:21.904,00:05:23.698,What a strange thing to do.
00:05:24.741,00:05:28.619,You'll soon find out there are times when this house is not exactly an ideal home.
00:05:29.704,00:05:34.584,"Hence my advertisement in the newspaper… requesting honest, hard-working people."
00:05:35.209,00:05:37.795,There's nobody more honest or hard-working than us.
00:05:37.879,00:05:39.213,"Isn't that right, Mr. Tuttle?"
00:05:39.297,00:05:40.590,"Oh, aye, we're very honest."
00:05:41.424,00:05:44.427,"And, um, very hard-working."
00:05:47.597,00:05:48.848,The kitchen.
00:05:50.016,00:05:53.811,I have breakfast at 8:00… the children at 9:00.
00:05:54.270,00:05:57.190,Lunch will be served at 1:00 and dinner at 7:30.
00:06:01.944,00:06:06.282,The master went off to war… a year and a half ago.
00:06:07.075,00:06:09.243,I've had no news since the war ended.
00:06:10.495,00:06:12.288,Which of you does the cooking?
00:06:14.665,00:06:16.042,Which of you does the cooking?
00:06:16.709,00:06:18.461,You'll notice what I'm doing.
00:06:19.045,00:06:24.425,"In this house, no door must be opened without the previous one being closed first."
00:06:24.509,00:06:26.552,It is vital that you remember this.
00:06:27.095,00:06:28.888,It's not as easy as it may seem.
00:06:29.097,00:06:34.602,There are 15 different keys for all of the 50 doors… depending on which area of the house you're in at the time.
00:06:35.686,00:06:40.525,"Mrs. Mills, from tomorrow onwards… I will be leaving a set of keys in your charge."
00:06:40.942,00:06:42.193,"Yes, ma'am."
00:06:42.735,00:06:44.320,The music room.
00:06:44.403,00:06:46.572,That old piano was already here when we moved in.
00:06:46.656,00:06:49.617,Please do not let the children thump away on it.
00:06:50.785,00:06:52.203,It sets off my migraine.
00:06:52.620,00:06:56.415,Silence is something that we prize very highly in this house.
00:06:57.333,00:07:02.046,"That is why you will not find a telephone, a radio… or anything else that makes a racket."
00:07:02.338,00:07:04.382,"Oh, we don't have electricity, either."
00:07:04.882,00:07:09.470,"During the war, the Germans kept cutting it off… so we learned to live without it. Let's continue."
00:07:09.554,00:07:12.181,"Ma'am, there's no need to show us the whole house."
00:07:14.058,00:07:15.393,"Yes, there is."
00:07:16.769,00:07:19.272,"Most of the time, you can hardly see your way."
00:07:19.355,00:07:27.989,"It's often difficult to make out if there is a table, a chair, a door, a sideboard… or one of my children playing hide and seek."
00:07:28.614,00:07:30.116,"What do you mean, ma'am?"
00:07:32.160,00:07:34.579,Perhaps I should introduce you to the children.
00:07:40.751,00:07:42.795,"Mr. Tuttle, you can see to the garden now."
00:07:42.879,00:07:44.046,You'll find tools in the shed.
00:07:44.130,00:07:45.214,"Yes, ma'am."
00:07:45.756,00:07:47.717,You two can start closing the curtains.
00:07:48.551,00:07:49.802,All of them.
00:08:20.124,00:08:21.209,Come.
00:08:32.678,00:08:34.472,I'll wake them. You wait here.
00:08:36.140,00:08:38.100,"Whatever you do, don't open the curtains."
00:08:41.687,00:08:43.272,"Wakey, wakey."
00:08:48.653,00:08:50.863,"Eyes closed, hands together."
00:08:54.742,00:08:56.953,"Jesus, to whom now I pray."
00:08:57.036,00:09:01.290,Blessed be the Virgin pure… whom I greet with faith too short.
00:09:01.374,00:09:05.962,"Jesus, Mary, spotless rose… keep us till this day doth close."
00:09:14.554,00:09:16.556,What sweet little children.
00:09:18.015,00:09:20.935,Well… what do you say?
00:09:21.602,00:09:23.020,How do you do?
00:09:23.896,00:09:24.981,How do you do?
00:09:26.232,00:09:27.942,"How do you do, children?"
00:09:28.609,00:09:33.573,My name is Mrs. Mills… but you can call me Bertha if you like.
00:09:35.866,00:09:36.951,Anne.
00:09:37.034,00:09:38.119,Nicholas.
00:09:38.244,00:09:42.415,Anne and Nicholas. What pretty names.
00:09:42.790,00:09:44.792,Are you going to be our new nanny?
00:09:46.460,00:09:47.461,Mm-hmm.
00:09:49.046,00:09:51.966,"Yes, my dears. I'm your new nanny."
00:09:52.258,00:09:53.843,It's time for their breakfast.
00:09:53.926,00:09:56.178,"Lydia, go to the kitchen and close every shutter."
00:10:03.561,00:10:05.813,The doctors were never able to find a cure.
00:10:08.357,00:10:09.650,Their condition.
00:10:10.985,00:10:13.821,The children have a very serious allergy to light.
00:10:14.864,00:10:19.035,They are photosensitive and must never be exposed to any light much stronger than this.
00:10:20.369,00:10:26.751,"Otherwise, in a matter of minutes… they will break out in sores and blisters and begin to suffocate."
00:10:26.959,00:10:28.544,It would eventually be fatal.
00:10:32.173,00:10:33.799,I don't like this toast.
00:10:33.883,00:10:35.343,Oh? Why not?
00:10:35.468,00:10:37.303,It tastes funny.
00:10:37.762,00:10:39.430,I liked it better before.
00:10:39.764,00:10:43.517,"That's because before, somebody else made it."
00:10:44.393,00:10:46.187,When are they coming back?
00:10:48.356,00:10:49.774,"They're not coming back, child."
00:10:50.608,00:10:52.068,Just like Daddy.
00:10:53.027,00:10:55.321,"Daddy is coming back, though."
00:11:00.951,00:11:03.037,"I know, but he's in France."
00:11:03.120,00:11:06.457,"That's enough, chatterboxes. Finish up your breakfasts."
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.251,"Are you going to leave us, too?"
00:11:11.504,00:11:12.963,Of course not!
00:11:16.467,00:11:20.137,"The others said they wouldn't… but they did, and then it happened."
00:11:21.055,00:11:22.139,Be quiet!
00:11:24.225,00:11:27.395,"What do you mean, Anne? What happened?"
00:11:29.522,00:11:33.109,Mummy went… mad.
00:11:35.152,00:11:36.612,"-Yes, it did. -No, it didn't!"
00:11:36.737,00:11:37.696,"Yes, it did!"
00:11:41.867,00:11:47.081,What's going on? I want those plates empty… in less than a minute. Is that clear?
00:11:50.876,00:11:52.711,"Mrs. Mills, would you come outside a moment?"
00:11:53.254,00:11:54.630,I'd like a word with you.
00:11:56.757,00:11:57.925,"Yes, ma'am."
00:12:02.513,00:12:04.890,The postman usually comes every Wednesday.
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.936,But I just checked the letter box and this week he hasn't.
00:12:10.604,00:12:11.730,"I'm afraid I don't follow, ma'am."
00:12:12.231,00:12:16.235,This letter should have been collected and delivered to the newspaper five days ago.
00:12:16.527,00:12:18.028,It's an advertisement for servants.
00:12:18.112,00:12:21.740,"Since it was never published, would you explain what you're doing here?"
00:12:22.283,00:12:23.868,"Oh, I understand."
00:12:25.119,00:12:29.540,"Ma'am, that's what I was going to say to you… when you opened the door to us."
00:12:29.957,00:12:33.961,The truth is that we just come by on the off chance.
00:12:34.628,00:12:38.841,A big house like this… is always in need of someone who knows the ropes.
00:12:38.924,00:12:41.302,You've served in a house like this one before?
00:12:41.760,00:12:47.933,"This may come as a surprise to you, ma'am, but… We, in fact, used to work here."
00:12:49.560,00:12:50.561,Here?
00:12:50.644,00:12:53.731,"Oh, now, 'twas a few years ago."
00:12:55.399,00:13:00.821,"If you don't mind my saying so, ma'am… they were the best years of my life."
00:13:02.406,00:13:07.036,"That's why we come by, because this house… means a lot to us."
00:13:08.496,00:13:10.664,"Perhaps I'd best show you our references, ma'am."
00:13:10.748,00:13:13.042,"No, no, no. Don't bother. There's no need."
00:13:13.125,00:13:15.294,So you say you know the house well?
00:13:15.586,00:13:17.838,Like the back of my hand.
00:13:18.255,00:13:23.219,That is assuming the walls haven't sprouted legs and moved in the meantime.
00:13:23.427,00:13:25.554,The only thing that moves here is the light.
00:13:29.266,00:13:30.893,But it changes everything.
00:13:35.940,00:13:38.192,"It's rather difficult, to say the least."
00:13:39.652,00:13:43.489,One might almost say… unbearable.
00:13:46.200,00:13:48.911,The only way of enduring it is by keeping a cool head.
00:13:50.204,00:13:51.539,"Oh, yes, ma'am."
00:13:51.914,00:13:53.791,I don't like fantasies.
00:13:54.708,00:13:56.544,Strange ideas. Do you know what I mean?
00:13:57.711,00:14:00.005,"I think so, ma'am."
00:14:00.089,00:14:02.508,My children sometimes have strange ideas.
00:14:04.760,00:14:06.845,But you mustn't pay any attention to them.
00:14:07.805,00:14:09.265,Children will be children.
00:14:10.724,00:14:12.268,"Yes, of course, ma'am."
00:14:13.060,00:14:14.061,All right.
00:14:16.522,00:14:17.314,&lrm;You can stay.
00:14:19.358,00:14:20.943,"Thank you very much, ma'am."
00:14:33.080,00:14:34.498,It did happen.
00:14:45.718,00:14:51.849,The Roman governor tried to make them change their minds afterwards… To make them change their minds. Full stop.
00:14:52.516,00:14:54.393,Afterwards… Mm-hmm.
00:14:54.476,00:14:56.020,He ordered them to be beaten.
00:14:56.312,00:15:02.902,"But Justus and Pastor, far from being afraid… rejoiced and showed themselves willing to die for Christ."
00:15:03.652,00:15:08.032,When he saw this… the Roman governor was filled with rage and ordered their heads to be cut off.
00:15:13.454,00:15:15.331,What do you find so amusing?
00:15:17.374,00:15:20.377,"Well… Well, what?"
00:15:20.669,00:15:23.130,Those children were really stupid.
00:15:24.089,00:15:24.715,Why?
00:15:24.798,00:15:29.178,Because they said they only believed in Jesus… and then they got killed for it.
00:15:29.887,00:15:32.014,"And what would you have done, deny Christ?"
00:15:33.766,00:15:38.437,"Inside I would have believed in him, but I wouldn't have told the Romans that."
00:15:41.190,00:15:43.108,"Is that what you think, too, Nicholas?"
00:15:47.279,00:15:48.322,I see.
00:15:49.740,00:15:53.285,So you would have lied to the point of denying Christ.
00:15:53.369,00:15:56.997,"You'd have saved your heads from the Romans, that's true."
00:15:57.456,00:15:59.208,But what would have happened afterwards?
00:15:59.291,00:16:00.334,When?
00:16:00.918,00:16:02.461,In the next life.
00:16:03.212,00:16:05.464,The one waiting for us after we die.
00:16:05.547,00:16:06.799,-Where would you have gone? -Oh.
00:16:06.924,00:16:08.008,Ah.
00:16:08.717,00:16:09.677,"Where, Nicholas?"
00:16:09.969,00:16:11.553,To the children's limbo.
00:16:11.637,00:16:13.430,"What is the children's limbo, Anne?"
00:16:13.514,00:16:14.807,One of the four Hells.
00:16:15.557,00:16:16.266,Which are?
00:16:20.604,00:16:21.981,"Me, me, me! Me!"
00:16:22.064,00:16:24.608,No. Let him answer. Which are?
00:16:24.984,00:16:30.948,There's the Hell where the damned go… then there's Purgatory… Yes.
00:16:31.031,00:16:34.284,And the bosom of Abraham where they just go… and limbo where children go.
00:16:34.410,00:16:35.786,At the center of the earth.
00:16:35.869,00:16:37.913,"Where it's very, very hot."
00:16:38.914,00:16:42.501,That's where children go who tell lies… but they don't just go there for a few days.
00:16:42.584,00:16:43.877,"Oh, no."
00:16:44.169,00:16:47.673,"No, they're damned. Forever."
00:16:51.635,00:16:55.639,Try to imagine the end of eternity.
00:17:02.229,00:17:03.439,Forever.
00:17:05.441,00:17:08.736,Pain… forever.
00:17:10.195,00:17:11.697,I'm getting dizzy.
00:17:14.241,00:17:17.786,Now do you understand why Justus and Pastor told the truth?
00:17:21.623,00:17:23.208,All right.
00:17:23.459,00:17:27.087,Um… Open your readers at lesson six.
00:17:27.171,00:17:28.213,Can't we play?
00:17:28.297,00:17:29.923,You most certainly cannot.
00:17:30.007,00:17:33.761,"First you're going to read the lesson, then you're going to learn it by heart."
00:17:33.844,00:17:34.803,All of it?
00:17:34.887,00:17:38.390,Any more protests and there'll be no playing at all today.
00:17:38.891,00:17:42.436,"In fact, I think you can study in separate rooms."
00:17:43.687,00:17:45.189,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:17:45.272,00:17:46.940,But we get scared if we're separated!
00:17:47.024,00:17:50.319,Scared? As if you weren't used to this house by now.
00:17:50.402,00:17:52.029,What if we see a ghost?
00:17:53.363,00:17:55.199,Has your sister been telling you one of her stories?
00:17:55.324,00:17:56.950,I haven't told him anything!
00:17:57.076,00:17:59.912,"If you see a ghost, you say, Hello… and continue on studying."
00:17:59.995,00:18:00.996,"Anne, come to the music room."
00:18:01.121,00:18:02.206,Why me?
00:18:02.331,00:18:04.124,Because I say so! Now come on.
00:18:04.666,00:18:06.043,Take your book.
00:18:06.543,00:18:09.379,"Nicholas, I want to see that lesson learned in less than an hour."
00:18:09.671,00:18:11.840,Mummy… What?
00:18:13.008,00:18:15.302,Give me a kiss.
00:18:15.385,00:18:17.262,Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
00:18:17.346,00:18:19.348,"Anne, wait for me outside."
00:18:19.723,00:18:21.391,You know I can't.
00:18:23.227,00:18:24.394,Over there.
00:18:27.064,00:18:30.275,"Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains."
00:18:30.984,00:18:33.028,My daughter is going to cross the living room.
00:18:33.779,00:18:34.905,"Yes, ma'am."
00:18:50.045,00:18:52.047,Mummy can't be with you all the time.
00:18:52.631,00:18:53.799,Hmm?
00:18:54.925,00:18:57.344,You must learn to be on your own.
00:18:59.888,00:19:01.306,Where's your rosary?
00:19:05.435,00:19:14.361,"Whenever you feel afraid… I want you to squeeze it with all your might… say an Our Father, and your fear will go away."
00:19:14.695,00:19:15.612,It won't.
00:19:15.696,00:19:18.031,"Yes, it will. Honestly."
00:19:19.783,00:19:22.411,Don't you see that when you do that the Lord is with you?
00:19:23.912,00:19:26.123,There's no reason to be afraid.
00:20:08.498,00:20:11.210,We all live in a house with our family.
00:20:11.585,00:20:17.341,"The family is usually made up of parents, children, and their grandparents."
00:20:17.424,00:20:27.226,We must be obedient… and we must never argue or fight with our brothers and sisters.
00:20:28.518,00:20:29.811,Do you have any children?
00:20:29.895,00:20:31.188,No.
00:20:31.772,00:20:37.069,Mr. Tuttle and the girl Lydia are all I've got… and I'm all they've got.
00:20:37.236,00:20:38.654,Was she born like that?
00:20:39.905,00:20:40.822,"Beg your pardon, ma'am?"
00:20:41.823,00:20:44.785,The girl. Was she born a mute?
00:20:45.744,00:20:46.828,No.
00:20:48.872,00:20:51.124,"I think I've finished here, ma'am."
00:20:51.208,00:20:55.504,"If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go and see if Mr. Tuttle needs a hand."
00:21:26.034,00:21:26.994,Nicholas!
00:21:32.291,00:21:33.959,"Nicholas, I'm coming!"
00:21:37.254,00:21:38.880,Oh!
00:21:41.091,00:21:42.050,Nicholas?
00:21:42.134,00:21:43.302,What's the matter?
00:21:43.385,00:21:44.344,Why were you crying?
00:21:44.428,00:21:46.555,I wasn't crying. I was reading.
00:21:47.347,00:21:51.184,But I just heard you… Anne!
00:22:01.486,00:22:02.863,Anne?
00:22:03.280,00:22:05.240,"I haven't learned it yet, Mummy."
00:22:05.699,00:22:06.867,Are you all right?
00:22:06.950,00:22:08.118,Yes.
00:22:09.036,00:22:10.329,Why were you crying?
00:22:10.412,00:22:11.747,I wasn't.
00:22:12.414,00:22:14.249,I just heard you a moment ago.
00:22:16.001,00:22:17.878,"There's no need to feel ashamed, darling."
00:22:17.961,00:22:19.171,I don't.
00:22:19.379,00:22:21.548,"If I'd been crying, I'd tell you."
00:22:21.673,00:22:23.800,"Oh, really. So I imagined it, did I?"
00:22:23.884,00:22:25.927,No. It was that boy.
00:22:26.678,00:22:27.929,What boy?
00:22:28.597,00:22:29.598,Victor.
00:22:30.807,00:22:31.975,Who's Victor?
00:22:33.185,00:22:35.270,The boy that was here a moment ago.
00:22:35.645,00:22:38.774,I told him to let me study… but he wouldn't stop crying.
00:22:39.649,00:22:41.485,I think he's a spoiled brat.
00:22:44.029,00:22:47.657,"Oh, did he, now? And why was he crying?"
00:22:47.741,00:22:54.039,Because he doesn't like this house… but he has to live here. His father's a pianist-- His father's a pianist?
00:22:54.122,00:22:58.210,Yes. I already told him he's not allowed to touch the piano.
00:22:58.293,00:22:59.628,"He isn't, is he, Mummy?"
00:23:01.421,00:23:03.590,"So, you've spoken to his father as well?"
00:23:03.673,00:23:05.467,"No, only with Victor."
00:23:05.550,00:23:07.052,His father's with the others in the hall.
00:23:07.135,00:23:09.304,I've just come from the hall. There's no one there.
00:23:11.306,00:23:14.059,They must've gone upstairs. They're viewing the house.
00:23:14.184,00:23:16.561,"That'll do, Anne! That's enough!"
00:23:18.105,00:23:19.189,Now why were you crying?
00:23:19.397,00:23:20.524,It was Victor!
00:23:20.607,00:23:21.733,So where is he now?
00:23:21.817,00:23:23.193,He went out through there!
00:23:23.318,00:23:27.614,Would you mind telling me how a boy can get in and out of this room if it's locked?
00:23:32.160,00:23:34.412,I thought I made myself quite clear.
00:23:35.372,00:23:38.667,No door is to be opened without the previous one being closed first.
00:23:38.750,00:23:40.836,Is that so hard to understand?
00:23:41.294,00:23:42.963,This house is like a ship.
00:23:43.046,00:23:47.717,The light must be contained as if it were water… by opening and closing the doors.
00:23:48.385,00:23:50.178,My children's lives are at stake!
00:23:51.429,00:23:53.181,Do not argue with me! Be quiet!
00:23:54.224,00:23:56.434,Which was the last of you to enter that room?
00:23:57.310,00:23:58.395,Lydia?
00:24:03.942,00:24:05.318,"That leaves you, then."
00:24:05.402,00:24:07.362,But I was in the hall the whole time.
00:24:07.445,00:24:09.739,And then I went out into the garden. You saw me with your own eyes.
00:24:10.157,00:24:12.450,I hope you are not suggesting that it was me!
00:24:13.743,00:24:18.331,Do you think that I would overlook such a thing and endanger the life of my own daughter?
00:24:25.380,00:24:27.674,You're not supposed to read at the table.
00:24:28.758,00:24:29.926,"Oh, really?"
00:24:30.010,00:24:32.721,Who's going to tell Mummy? You?
00:24:35.557,00:24:37.184,Or perhaps you?
00:24:43.690,00:24:45.275,Did you really see a boy?
00:24:46.526,00:24:48.195,Yes. He's called Victor.
00:24:50.780,00:24:52.407,Is he a ghost?
00:24:52.490,00:24:54.993,Don't be stupid. Ghosts aren't like that.
00:24:55.202,00:24:56.953,What are they like?
00:24:57.204,00:24:59.539,I've told you a thousand times.
00:24:59.623,00:25:02.334,They go about in white sheets and carry chains.
00:25:02.417,00:25:03.376,How do you know?
00:25:03.668,00:25:05.003,Because I've seen them.
00:25:05.086,00:25:06.546,They come out at night.
00:25:07.756,00:25:09.549,Fibber. Where?
00:25:16.765,00:25:17.807,You're stupid.
00:25:17.891,00:25:19.559,Not half as much as you.
00:25:19.643,00:25:21.770,I don't believe you saw that boy.
00:25:21.853,00:25:23.021,Believe what you like.
00:25:23.104,00:25:25.106,You'll soon be begging us to play with you.
00:25:46.336,00:25:48.129,Why have you opened the curtains?
00:25:48.213,00:25:49.089,It wasn't me.
00:25:49.172,00:25:50.090,"Who was it, then?"
00:25:50.840,00:25:52.259,It was Victor.
00:25:52.634,00:25:53.969,He's been doing it all night.
00:25:55.428,00:25:57.055,You're lying. I'm going to tell Mummy.
00:25:57.138,00:25:59.474,"-So I'm a liar, am I? -Yes."
00:26:00.392,00:26:04.521,"Victor, come out from behind that curtain so my stupid brother can see you."
00:26:14.531,00:26:16.074,Leave me alone.
00:26:16.157,00:26:18.034,"So you don't want to see him now, eh?"
00:26:18.326,00:26:19.828,You're a cowardly custard.
00:26:20.036,00:26:23.581,Cowardly cowardly custard.
00:26:25.667,00:26:28.003,"I'll just have to do it myself, then."
00:26:52.277,00:26:53.653,Tell him to leave the curtains alone.
00:26:53.737,00:26:54.904,He won't listen to me.
00:27:00.827,00:27:03.621,"Anne, please stop putting on that voice."
00:27:03.705,00:27:06.207,"You be quiet, cowardly custard."
00:27:09.878,00:27:11.212,and she'll kick you out.
00:27:15.342,00:27:18.219,"Anne, I'm going to tell Mummy about you."
00:27:18.303,00:27:20.722,Don't be stupid. Can't you see it's not me?
00:27:46.206,00:27:49.626,"She was fighting with me, and I told her to be quiet."
00:27:49.751,00:27:51.753,I'm fed up. Do you hear me?
00:27:52.462,00:27:53.797,I am fed up with you!
00:27:53.880,00:27:55.507,I didn't do anything!
00:27:59.135,00:28:06.684,Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden… to till the ground from whence he was taken.
00:28:06.935,00:28:17.028,So he drove out the man… and placed to the east of the Garden of Eden… cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life.
00:28:17.487,00:28:19.572,There. I finished.
00:28:20.824,00:28:22.242,Very good.
00:28:24.661,00:28:27.372,Now you can ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
00:28:27.705,00:28:30.750,What? That's not what we agreed!
00:28:30.959,00:28:32.752,"We didn't agree anything, young lady."
00:28:33.044,00:28:35.755,"Today you're being punished, and you'll do as I say."
00:28:35.880,00:28:37.841,You can't make me ask the Virgin for forgiveness.
00:28:38.174,00:28:39.300,How dare you!
00:28:39.426,00:28:42.554,"Mummy, I won't ask forgiveness for something I didn't do!"
00:28:42.679,00:28:44.723,You told your brother someone else was in the room!
00:28:44.848,00:28:46.141,-There was! -You're lying!
00:28:46.307,00:28:46.975,I am not!
00:28:49.227,00:28:54.691,Anne… do you remember the story about Justus and Pastor?
00:28:55.233,00:28:57.986,Children who don't tell the truth end up in limbo.
00:28:58.570,00:29:03.992,"That's what you say, but I read the other day that limbo's only for children who haven't been baptized."
00:29:04.868,00:29:06.494,And I have!
00:29:10.165,00:29:14.294,of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son.
00:29:14.544,00:29:20.300,"And he took the fire in his hand and a knife… and they went, both of them together."
00:29:20.633,00:29:46.075,"And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said, 'My father…' and he said, 'Here I am, my son.' Did you look in on Nicholas?"
00:29:46.367,00:29:49.954,"Yes, ma'am. The little angel is fast asleep."
00:29:51.122,00:29:52.290,What about Anne?
00:29:52.791,00:29:54.167,Is she still on the stairs?
00:29:54.709,00:29:55.835,"Oh, yes, ma'am."
00:29:57.462,00:30:01.633,I'd prefer to have her where I can see her but I can't embroider in such poor light.
00:30:05.553,00:30:07.180,How long is this punishment going to go on?
00:30:07.263,00:30:08.681,It's been three days now.
00:30:09.516,00:30:10.809,It's up to her.
00:30:13.019,00:30:16.314,She's got to learn to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness.
00:30:17.398,00:30:19.818,"Anyway, it's time she started to read the Bible."
00:30:21.152,00:30:24.364,"The priest will be very pleased to hear that, ma'am."
00:30:28.827,00:30:32.247,He told me yesterday he'd be by as soon as possible.
00:30:38.086,00:30:41.548,This fog doesn't exactly help. It's never lasted this long before.
00:30:41.631,00:30:43.299,"Oh, that's true, ma'am."
00:30:43.758,00:30:45.760,Even the seagulls have gone quiet.
00:30:48.805,00:30:50.014,Anne!
00:30:51.057,00:30:52.892,"Anne, I can't hear you."
00:30:58.147,00:31:02.735,"Incidentally, Mrs. Mills, I've had to put up with the noise of Lydia running around above my head."
00:31:02.819,00:31:05.947,She's been hurling backwards and forwards as if there were three of her.
00:31:06.573,00:31:10.743,Would you kindly tell her it's not necessary to kick up quite such a rumpus just to do a little cleaning?
00:31:11.661,00:31:13.788,I couldn't bear to get another migraine attack.
00:31:13.872,00:31:15.373,"I'll tell her, ma'am."
00:32:04.464,00:32:06.090,Now she's really gone too far.
00:32:06.758,00:32:09.218,Lydia! Lydia!
00:32:33.117,00:32:35.703,And the angel of the Lord-- What's going on up there?
00:32:35.787,00:32:38.289,"Nothing, Mummy. I'm just reading."
00:32:38.623,00:32:39.999,Did you hear it as well?
00:32:40.416,00:32:41.668,Hear what?
00:32:46.798,00:33:07.276,"And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of Heaven the second time and said… 'By myself, I have sworn,' saith the Lord-- What was that?"
00:33:07.652,00:33:08.778,I don't know.
00:33:09.570,00:33:12.073,"Anne, tell me who's making that noise."
00:33:12.532,00:33:14.033,"I can't tell you, Mummy."
00:33:14.659,00:33:15.827,You tell me.
00:33:15.910,00:33:20.123,I told you there was someone in the room and you punished me.
00:33:20.206,00:33:21.374,Now I don't know what to say.
00:33:21.499,00:33:23.209,"Anne, I want the truth."
00:33:25.211,00:33:27.255,Tell me if there is someone upstairs.
00:33:29.799,00:33:31.551,There. In that junk room.
00:34:21.184,00:34:23.561,"Mummy, you're letting the light in."
00:35:22.370,00:35:23.579,Shh!
00:35:30.461,00:35:31.420,Oh!
00:35:50.565,00:35:51.482,Where did they go?
00:35:51.607,00:35:53.693,They just came past here. Didn't you see them?
00:35:54.068,00:35:55.319,Which way did they go?
00:35:55.570,00:35:58.614,"Over there, over there, and down there as well."
00:36:04.996,00:36:07.165,They're everywhere. They say this house is theirs.
00:36:08.624,00:36:11.836,And they say they're going to take the curtains down.
00:36:13.796,00:36:15.506,"Ma'am, stay calm, please."
00:36:15.590,00:36:16.757,I will not stay calm!
00:36:17.133,00:36:25.057,"For five whole years during the occupation… I managed to avoid a single Nazi stepping foot in this house and now there is someone here, opening and closing the doors."
00:36:25.141,00:36:27.602,"Ma'am, this is a very old house."
00:36:27.685,00:36:31.898,The floorboards squeak and the plumbing clanks-- There were voices. I'm telling you.
00:36:33.816,00:36:35.735,"-talking together. -Mummy, look!"
00:36:38.654,00:36:40.072,I did it yesterday.
00:36:42.783,00:36:45.828,"this is Victor, and this is the old woman."
00:36:45.912,00:36:47.872,What do these numbers stand for?
00:36:57.506,00:36:58.799,God in Heaven.
00:36:58.883,00:37:00.426,"Mrs. Mills, go and call Mr. Tuttle."
00:37:00.509,00:37:03.930,We have to search the whole house immediately… before it gets dark.
00:37:04.013,00:37:04.972,"Yes, ma'am. There, now."
00:37:05.056,00:37:05.890,Mummy!
00:37:05.973,00:37:07.183,"Yes, darling. It's all right."
00:37:07.600,00:37:10.645,Nothing will happen to you while Mummy's here. Hmm?
00:37:13.898,00:37:16.817,It's as if she's not looking at you but she can see you.
00:37:16.901,00:37:21.239,"And she's always around saying Come with me -- No, Anne, don't lie to me."
00:37:24.283,00:37:26.285,Victor told me she's a witch.
00:37:28.120,00:37:29.497,Things.
00:37:31.999,00:37:33.793,Her breath smells.
00:37:39.840,00:37:42.134,I don't want any dark corners where someone could hide.
00:37:42.218,00:37:42.843,"Yes, ma'am."
00:37:45.930,00:37:47.139,Then we'll search upstairs.
00:39:00.671,00:39:02.548,who lived in this house before.
00:39:02.673,00:39:05.217,Don't be stupid. I've already told you.
00:39:05.301,00:39:08.804,Ghosts go about in white sheets and carry chains and go Ooh.
00:39:11.265,00:39:13.559,Why do you make up such stories?
00:39:13.642,00:39:15.686,I don't. I read them in books.
00:39:15.770,00:39:18.731,"Well, you shouldn't believe everything that you read in books."
00:39:19.106,00:39:20.691,That's what our mother says.
00:39:20.775,00:39:27.990,She says all this stuff about ghosts is rubbish… and then she expects us… to believe everything written in the Bible.
00:39:28.240,00:39:29.658,And don't you believe it?
00:39:31.327,00:39:36.040,"But, for example, I don't believe that God made the world in seven days."
00:39:36.123,00:39:42.671,And I don't believe that Noah got all those animals into one boat… or the Holy Spirit is a dove.
00:39:42.755,00:39:44.924,"No, I don't believe that, either."
00:39:46.675,00:39:48.219,They poo on our windows.
00:39:53.974,00:39:57.728,Have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
00:41:05.713,00:41:06.881,Yes?
00:41:07.882,00:41:09.758,"They've searched everywhere, ma'am."
00:41:10.009,00:41:10.968,There's no one.
00:41:11.343,00:41:12.470,I see.
00:41:15.139,00:41:16.307,Mrs. Mills.
00:41:18.058,00:41:19.059,"Yes, ma'am?"
00:41:20.102,00:41:22.271,Do you have any idea what this might be?
00:41:24.273,00:41:26.066,"'Tis a photograph album, ma'am."
00:41:26.150,00:41:27.610,"No, but look. They're all asleep."
00:41:28.110,00:41:29.236,Look.
00:41:29.862,00:41:32.198,"They're not asleep, ma'am. They're dead."
00:41:37.995,00:41:44.668,they used to take photographs of the dead in the hopes that their souls would go on living through the portraits.
00:41:53.511,00:41:54.970,"Oh, it's macabre!"
00:41:57.348,00:41:59.850,How could these people be so superstitious?
00:42:00.976,00:42:06.190,Grief over the death of a loved one can lead people to do the strangest things.
00:42:27.169,00:42:30.047,"Mrs. Mills, it's cold. Why don't you come and sit by the fire?"
00:42:42.810,00:42:44.478,"Thank you very much, ma'am."
00:42:45.688,00:42:48.440,So… tell me about when you worked here before.
00:42:49.441,00:42:51.151,Did you have to look after children then?
00:42:51.610,00:42:55.823,"No, I was in charge of organizing the housework."
00:42:55.906,00:42:56.740,Hmm.
00:42:57.283,00:42:58.325,Were there many servants?
00:42:59.285,00:43:01.370,"Oh, about fifteen."
00:43:02.663,00:43:05.791,Though in the end… there were just the three of us left.
00:43:05.874,00:43:06.709,Why?
00:43:07.418,00:43:09.545,My employers moved to London.
00:43:10.004,00:43:15.509,They came here less and less… it being so out of the way like.
00:43:15.926,00:43:19.888,So gradually the house just became empty.
00:43:21.515,00:43:23.892,Everybody ends up leaving this damned island.
00:43:25.894,00:43:30.357,My family left in the summer of 1940… just before the invasion.
00:43:32.526,00:43:34.194,That was the last I've heard of them.
00:43:36.155,00:43:40.326,Oh… I don't blame them.
00:43:41.952,00:43:43.954,"Actually, we left, too."
00:43:45.914,00:43:53.672,"Although, you know… sometimes when you leave a place… it's like it's there with you all the time."
00:43:54.173,00:43:57.092,I always felt like I never left this house.
00:43:57.468,00:43:58.427,Why did you leave?
00:43:59.845,00:44:01.972,"Oh, 'twas on account of the tuberculosis."
00:44:02.056,00:44:04.224,The whole area was evacuated.
00:44:05.684,00:44:09.730,Um… Was that when Lydia went dumb?
00:44:10.814,00:44:17.112,"Yes, I think so… though my memory's a bit rusty these days, ma'am."
00:44:17.196,00:44:18.405,What happened to her?
00:44:24.745,00:44:26.538,It was suddenly one day.
00:44:26.997,00:44:31.043,She just… stopped talking.
00:44:31.460,00:44:33.087,There must've been a reason.
00:44:34.546,00:44:36.590,People don't just stop talking.
00:44:36.840,00:44:40.803,These things are always the result… of some sort of trauma.
00:44:41.637,00:44:43.347,Something must've happened to her.
00:44:47.810,00:44:49.395,Did your employers treat you well?
00:44:49.478,00:44:52.064,"Oh, they were always very kind to us."
00:44:52.272,00:44:54.316,They treated us just like family.
00:44:56.902,00:44:59.696,"You know, ma'am, I think I will go to bed."
00:44:59.780,00:45:02.741,I'll never be able to get up in the morning.
00:45:02.991,00:45:04.118,Off you go.
00:45:04.910,00:45:06.495,I'm going to stay here a while longer.
00:45:07.204,00:45:08.497,"Yes, ma'am."
00:45:42.573,00:45:44.825,I'm sorry I was so hard on you.
00:45:52.708,00:45:54.209,Can you forgive me?
00:46:00.591,00:46:01.717,Anne.
00:46:22.488,00:46:23.363,What?
00:46:24.031,00:46:25.824,When's Daddy coming home?
00:46:27.159,00:46:28.660,When the war's over.
00:46:31.580,00:46:35.000,"I mean, nobody's done anything bad to us."
00:46:36.668,00:46:49.932,Daddy went… Daddy went because he's very brave… and because he wasn't prepared to let the Germans tell him what he had to do.
00:47:00.526,00:47:05.322,Charles… Where are you?
00:49:53.615,00:49:55.075,Mrs. Mills!
00:49:56.743,00:49:58.286,Mrs. Mills!
00:49:59.788,00:50:01.248,"What's the matter, ma'am?"
00:50:01.331,00:50:04.459,"The key to the music room, give it to me! Quickly!"
00:50:04.543,00:50:05.669,"What's happening, ma'am?"
00:50:05.752,00:50:06.878,Come on!
00:50:16.138,00:50:17.431,"Oh, my God."
00:50:21.435,00:50:23.478,I checked that room myself.
00:50:25.856,00:50:27.107,It was empty.
00:50:27.899,00:50:29.443,"Take these tablets, ma'am."
00:50:29.651,00:50:31.570,And yet… They'll do you good.
00:50:31.653,00:50:34.406,And yet I felt as if there was someone else there.
00:50:42.914,00:50:44.624,Something diabolic.
00:50:44.833,00:50:52.549,Ma'am… Something which is not… not at rest.
00:50:57.179,00:50:58.847,I know you don't believe it.
00:50:59.890,00:51:01.433,"You don't believe it, do you?"
00:51:02.309,00:51:03.560,I don't blame you.
00:51:04.060,00:51:06.772,I used to not believe these things.
00:51:09.107,00:51:10.901,"I do believe it, ma'am."
00:51:14.571,00:51:16.615,I've always believed in those things.
00:51:17.616,00:51:21.369,They're not easy to explain… but they do happen.
00:51:21.745,00:51:40.055,We've all heard stories of… the beyond… now and then… and I think sometimes the world of the dead… gets mixed up with the world of the living.
00:51:41.973,00:51:43.391,But it's impossible.
00:51:43.475,00:51:45.769,The Lord would never allow such an aberration.
00:51:45.852,00:51:49.481,The living and the dead… will only meet at the end of eternity.
00:51:52.275,00:51:53.944,It says so in the Bible.
00:51:54.027,00:51:59.866,Ma'am… there isn't always an answer for everything.
00:52:14.464,00:52:17.133,I'm going to the village to pay Father McGraw a visit.
00:52:17.551,00:52:19.511,"If he won't come here, then I shall go to him."
00:52:19.761,00:52:20.804,I shall bring him back.
00:52:20.887,00:52:22.347,"Ma'am, you should wait till the weather improves."
00:52:22.430,00:52:23.849,I've waited long enough.
00:52:25.308,00:52:28.937,"Ma'am, the priest told me that-- I don't care what he told you!"
00:52:29.521,00:52:31.314,I want him to tell me personally!
00:52:31.606,00:52:32.983,He must come today!
00:52:33.191,00:52:34.860,But what are you going to tell him?
00:52:34.943,00:52:39.823,That we have searched every room inch by inch… and now I need them to be blessed.
00:52:46.788,00:52:47.956,"Morning, ma'am."
00:52:48.123,00:52:50.876,I need you to search the garden for gravestones.
00:52:50.959,00:52:51.918,Gravestones?
00:52:52.002,00:52:55.130,Yes. When my husband bought this house we were told there was a little cemetery.
00:52:55.213,00:52:57.549,"I think it was over there, amongst the trees."
00:52:57.716,00:52:58.884,I've not seen anything.
00:52:58.967,00:53:01.803,Check carefully. It could be overgrown.
00:53:02.429,00:53:03.430,"Yes, ma'am."
00:53:03.513,00:53:07.684,I need to know if there was a family buried here… and if they had a little boy-- Victor.
00:53:24.034,00:53:26.077,Now she thinks the house is haunted.
00:53:27.454,00:53:29.497,Do you think it's safe to let her go?
00:53:29.789,00:53:32.792,"Oh, don't worry. The fog won't let her get very far."
00:53:33.084,00:53:34.628,"Oh, yes, the fog."
00:53:34.711,00:53:36.504,"The fog, of course."
00:53:37.380,00:53:41.801,And when do you think… we should bring all this out into the open?
00:53:42.385,00:53:44.304,"All in good time, Mr. Tuttle."
00:53:44.387,00:53:46.264,All in good time.
00:53:47.140,00:53:48.808,Speaking of which.
00:53:49.601,00:53:50.602,Oh!
00:54:59.796,00:55:09.014,Wha-- Oh.
00:55:39.252,00:55:40.462,Oh!
00:55:43.548,00:55:44.257,Charles?
00:55:46.092,00:55:46.926,Grace?
00:55:52.182,00:55:53.391,Oh!
00:55:54.642,00:55:55.602,Oh!
00:56:07.614,00:56:09.824,They said I should give you up for dead.
00:56:10.575,00:56:12.035,They say a lot of things.
00:56:15.246,00:56:16.456,Oh!
00:56:17.999,00:56:19.250,Thank you.
00:56:19.834,00:56:21.002,"Thank you, God."
00:56:21.461,00:56:22.796,"Thank you, God."
00:56:23.296,00:56:28.176,Every night I prayed for this… begging God to bring you back.
00:56:30.678,00:56:32.597,Bring the children their father back.
00:56:32.889,00:56:39.187,Bring him… But where have you been all this time?
00:56:40.396,00:56:43.817,Out there… looking for my home.
00:56:51.908,00:56:53.368,You're so different.
00:56:55.120,00:56:56.329,So different.
00:56:57.122,00:56:58.665,Sometimes I bleed.
00:57:36.953,00:57:45.628,Ma'am-- Mrs. Mills… this is my husband.
00:57:49.716,00:57:52.218,"I'm very pleased to meet you, sir."
00:57:52.343,00:57:53.720,He's very weak.
00:57:54.512,00:57:55.763,Here.
00:57:58.224,00:58:00.894,I want you to prepare a hot bath and some clean clothes.
00:58:03.688,00:58:04.939,"Right away, ma'am."
00:58:24.667,00:58:26.002,How are my little ones?
00:58:29.088,00:58:30.215,Daddy!
00:58:42.268,00:58:43.603,"Hello, Nicholas."
00:58:43.686,00:58:44.812,"I told you, you see."
00:58:56.199,00:58:57.325,We've been very good.
00:58:57.450,00:58:58.826,Have you been good to your mother?
00:59:00.286,00:59:02.539,We study every day for our First Communion.
00:59:03.790,00:59:05.458,"Daddy, did you kill anyone?"
00:59:12.298,00:59:14.425,Oh! Here he comes!
00:59:18.012,00:59:21.307,"Darling, we've prepared lunch for you."
00:59:22.016,00:59:44.330,Are you coming down or would you prefer-- He said he'd seen a lot of dead men.
00:59:44.664,00:59:45.957,Shh!
00:59:49.460,00:59:53.089,"Mummy, when people die in the war… Where do they go?"
00:59:55.675,00:59:56.718,It depends.
00:59:57.552,00:59:58.720,On what?
00:59:58.928,01:00:02.765,Whether they fought on the side of the goodies or the baddies.
01:00:03.057,01:00:06.728,"Your father, for example, fought for England… on the side of the goodies."
01:00:09.647,01:00:11.774,How do you know who the goodies and the baddies are?
01:00:12.900,01:00:14.736,That's enough questions. Eat your food.
01:00:14.861,01:00:16.070,You'll never go to war.
01:00:16.487,01:00:18.156,We'll never go anywhere.
01:00:18.823,01:00:23.286,Oh… You're not missing out on anything.
01:00:24.120,01:00:28.249,"You're much better off at home with your Mummy and Daddy… who love you very, very much."
01:00:30.501,01:00:31.586,And the intruders.
01:00:33.755,01:00:35.131,There are no intruders here.
01:00:36.424,01:00:38.009,But you said that there were.
01:00:38.134,01:00:39.677,"No, I said that there are no intruders here."
01:00:39.761,01:00:41.596,I don't want to hear another word on the subject.
01:00:42.639,01:00:44.098,That is enough!
01:00:44.974,01:00:46.267,Can I say something?
01:00:47.268,01:00:50.313,-Why not? -Because you can't!
01:00:56.986,01:00:58.821,"Anne, stop breathing like that."
01:01:05.995,01:01:07.955,Stop breathing.
01:01:10.541,01:01:12.001,"Right, you go to your room."
01:01:12.168,01:01:14.462,Go to your room. No dessert for you today.
01:01:21.386,01:01:24.138,"No crying now, no crying."
01:01:24.222,01:01:26.766,"Oh, stop that here."
01:01:26.849,01:01:29.435,Look what an awful face you've got when you cry.
01:01:29.519,01:01:31.020,I don't care!
01:01:31.104,01:01:33.064,"There, there."
01:01:33.564,01:01:35.108,You listen to me.
01:01:37.318,01:01:39.070,"I've seen them, too."
01:01:40.405,01:01:41.364,You have?
01:01:42.281,01:01:43.366,Yes.
01:01:44.033,01:01:46.953,Why don't you tell my mother? Then maybe she'll believe me.
01:01:47.036,01:01:49.831,There are things your mother doesn't want to hear.
01:01:50.456,01:01:52.917,She only believes in what she was taught.
01:01:53.418,01:01:59.674,"But don't worry, sooner or later… she'll see them."
01:02:00.216,01:02:02.510,Then everything will be different.
01:02:02.760,01:02:04.053,How?
01:02:05.096,01:02:07.390,"Oh, you'll see."
01:02:07.724,01:02:10.727,There are going to be some big surprises.
01:02:11.686,01:02:15.398,There are going to be… &lrm;changes.
01:02:16.190,01:02:17.734,Changes?
01:02:29.620,01:02:32.957,Now she's behaving as if nothing had happened.
01:02:34.417,01:02:35.960,What about her daughter?
01:02:36.669,01:02:38.254,"Oh, she's not so stubborn."
01:02:38.796,01:02:40.923,The children will be easier to convince.
01:02:42.216,01:02:45.219,"No, it's the mother who's going to cause us problems."
01:02:47.388,01:02:50.141,Do you think her husband suspects anything?
01:02:51.517,01:02:55.396,No. I don't think he even knows where he is.
01:03:10.328,01:03:11.496,Oh!
01:03:11.579,01:03:13.873,Look what a pretty daughter I've got.
01:03:16.542,01:03:19.629,Mummy made this veil especially for you.
01:03:21.589,01:03:23.299,I look like a bride.
01:03:24.884,01:03:27.345,Yes. You do.
01:03:32.725,01:03:34.560,I need to shorten the sleeves a little.
01:03:35.520,01:03:36.646,You can take it off now.
01:03:36.729,01:03:37.647,No.
01:03:37.730,01:03:39.315,This dress has to be spotless for your First Communion.
01:03:39.398,01:03:41.275,I promise I won't dirty it.
01:03:41.359,01:03:44.028,Just let me wear it for a little longer.
01:03:44.111,01:03:45.738,"Oh, just a little?"
01:03:47.281,01:03:51.035,All right. I'll be back shortly.
01:03:51.828,01:03:53.955,No sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls.
01:03:54.038,01:03:54.956,No.
01:04:11.764,01:04:14.225,"Monsieur, would you like to dance?"
01:04:42.295,01:04:44.046,"Charles, you can't go on like this."
01:04:44.130,01:04:45.590,You must eat something.
01:04:50.845,01:06:05.670,"Ooh… Anne, you need to take the dress off now."
01:06:09.715,01:06:11.634,"Anne, are you listening to me?"
01:06:14.053,01:06:15.346,Anne?
01:06:19.934,01:06:22.395,What did I tell you about sitting on the floor?
01:06:23.854,01:06:25.064,It makes no difference.
01:06:25.147,01:06:55.011,Why can't you ever do as you're told… Where is my daughter?
01:06:58.764,01:07:00.599,What have you done with my daughter?
01:07:00.891,01:07:03.978,Are you mad? I am your daughter.
01:07:13.070,01:07:15.740,You're not my daughter! No!
01:07:29.920,01:07:31.422,"Ma'am, I heard shouts."
01:07:31.505,01:07:32.673,She wants to kill me!
01:07:35.468,01:07:36.635,She won't stop!
01:07:36.719,01:07:38.804,"Hush, child. Come with me."
01:07:39.055,01:07:41.432,You're wicked! You're wicked! wicked!
01:07:54.487,01:07:55.780,How is she?
01:07:56.280,01:08:00.284,There's no calming her… so I've left her with her father.
01:08:06.957,01:08:10.211,What happened? Why did you fight?
01:08:10.586,01:08:12.004,It wasn't her.
01:08:13.255,01:08:16.383,It was the old woman with the strange eyes.
01:08:16.467,01:08:18.928,She was imitating my daughter's voice.
01:08:19.053,01:08:21.639,I'd swear to God that it wasn't my daughter.
01:08:24.391,01:08:26.852,"Oh, God. God help me."
01:08:28.813,01:08:30.898,God help me. What's the matter with me?
01:08:31.899,01:08:33.526,I don't know what's the matter with me.
01:08:39.240,01:08:43.369,You can't take on the whole responsibility of this house.
01:08:43.953,01:08:45.371,Leave it to us.
01:08:45.830,01:08:47.456,We know what has to be done.
01:08:51.168,01:08:52.753,What do you mean by that?
01:08:54.505,01:08:56.507,What do you mean you know what has to be done?
01:08:56.590,01:09:00.052,"Nothing, ma'am. I was just suggesting-- There's nothing to suggest."
01:09:01.929,01:09:04.807,Who do you think you are? You have no idea what has to be done.
01:09:19.697,01:09:21.740,"The tablets for your migraine, ma'am."
01:09:23.409,01:09:24.785,The ones you always take.
01:09:26.120,01:09:27.913,"Please, I need to be on my own."
01:09:29.957,01:09:31.000,"Yes, ma'am."
01:09:54.857,01:09:56.025,"Come, child."
01:10:27.890,01:10:30.184,"I wish I had an explanation, but I haven't."
01:10:31.060,01:10:33.312,"At first, I thought there was someone else in the house."
01:10:33.395,01:10:34.939,Even thought there were ghosts.
01:10:35.022,01:10:36.857,I'm not talking about the ghosts.
01:10:38.442,01:10:40.945,I'm talking about what happened that day.
01:10:48.202,01:10:49.870,I don't know what you're talking about.
01:10:55.084,01:10:56.252,Happened?
01:11:02.258,01:11:05.052,I don't know what came over me that day.
01:11:05.511,01:11:09.181,The servants had left during the night.
01:11:09.723,01:11:12.351,Hadn't the courage to tell me to my face.
01:11:15.062,01:11:19.775,They knew that I couldn't leave the house.
01:11:21.610,01:11:22.611,They knew.
01:11:26.198,01:11:27.241,Anne.
01:11:28.951,01:11:31.328,"Anne, what happened?"
01:11:33.789,01:11:35.332,She hit me.
01:11:36.166,01:11:39.211,She went mad like she did that day.
01:11:43.382,01:11:44.341,No.
01:11:46.635,01:11:48.470,"You must forgive me, Charles."
01:11:50.681,01:11:53.934,Not me. The children.
01:11:55.060,01:11:56.687,They know that I love them.
01:11:57.980,01:12:00.441,They know I'd never hurt them.
01:12:00.524,01:12:01.984,I'd die first.
01:12:05.738,01:12:07.197,What are you going to do?
01:12:14.747,01:12:17.916,I just came back to say goodbye to my wife and children.
01:12:18.709,01:12:20.127,Now I must go.
01:12:21.086,01:12:22.129,Go where?
01:12:23.756,01:12:25.090,To the front.
01:12:25.382,01:12:26.759,No. The war's over.
01:12:28.427,01:12:29.636,The war is not over.
01:12:29.762,01:12:31.430,What are you talking about?
01:12:33.640,01:12:35.225,"You're not going, do you hear me?"
01:12:35.309,01:12:37.519,You left us once already. You can't go!
01:12:38.937,01:12:40.147,Why?
01:12:40.606,01:12:45.444,Why did you have to go to that stupid war that had nothing to do with us?
01:12:46.570,01:12:49.031,Why couldn't you have stayed here like the others?
01:12:49.114,01:12:50.240,The others surrendered.
01:12:50.366,01:12:51.825,We all surrendered!
01:12:52.284,01:12:54.078,The whole island was occupied!
01:12:54.161,01:12:57.873,What did you expect?
01:13:03.003,01:13:06.006,What were you trying to prove by going to war?
01:13:06.090,01:13:08.550,Your place was here with us.
01:13:10.344,01:13:11.637,With your family.
01:13:21.438,01:13:23.023,That was enough for me.
01:13:24.525,01:13:30.239,Living in this darkness… In this prison.
01:13:33.742,01:13:35.077,But not for you.
01:13:37.287,01:13:39.206,I wasn't enough for you.
01:13:40.416,01:13:41.917,That's why you left.
01:13:45.337,01:13:46.713,It wasn't just the war.
01:13:50.342,01:13:52.553,"You want to leave me, don't you?"
01:16:14.361,01:16:18.907,What is it? What-- Oh!
01:16:21.785,01:16:23.036,"Oh, my God!"
01:16:23.620,01:16:27.291,"Here! Oh, my God!"
01:16:32.796,01:16:34.506,Here!
01:16:38.969,01:16:39.803,Oh!
01:16:46.393,01:16:47.894,Where are the curtains?
01:17:10.083,01:17:11.835,Let me see. Let me see.
01:17:13.128,01:17:16.006,"Oh, you're all right! You're all right!"
01:17:16.256,01:17:17.924,I want my daddy!
01:17:23.555,01:17:24.973,Daddy's gone.
01:17:25.474,01:17:26.683,It's not true!
01:17:27.601,01:17:28.894,"Yes, it is."
01:17:30.520,01:17:31.730,It is true.
01:17:34.441,01:17:35.942,"I love you, Mummy."
01:17:44.159,01:17:45.702,Find the curtains.
01:17:49.247,01:17:50.290,Who was it?
01:17:52.668,01:17:53.794,Tell me!
01:17:54.336,01:17:55.796,Tell me!
01:17:57.923,01:17:59.174,You know what's happening here!
01:17:59.257,01:18:01.551,"You know because it happened to you, too!"
01:18:01.843,01:18:03.053,You'll tell me.
01:18:03.762,01:18:04.846,You write it down.
01:18:05.722,01:18:08.225,Write it down! Please!
01:18:12.604,01:18:14.189,"Anyway, she can't write."
01:18:15.399,01:18:16.650,What?
01:18:16.733,01:18:17.734,The curtains!
01:18:18.068,01:18:20.487,The curtains my children's lives depend on!
01:18:20.570,01:18:21.947,Someone has taken the curtains!
01:18:22.072,01:18:23.490,"I have noticed, ma'am."
01:18:23.573,01:18:26.034,There's no need for you to raise your voice.
01:18:26.827,01:18:30.414,"Oh, Mr. Tuttle. I was just on the point of calling you."
01:18:30.831,01:18:33.834,Did you know that someone has taken all the curtains?
01:18:35.127,01:18:36.461,The curtains?
01:18:37.838,01:18:39.047,"Oh, dear."
01:18:40.257,01:18:43.135,Why should anyone want to take all the curtains?
01:18:44.636,01:18:47.264,"To let some daylight into this house, I imagine."
01:18:48.140,01:18:50.517,Daylight. Of course.
01:18:51.059,01:18:52.853,Someone wants to kill my children.
01:18:52.936,01:18:55.814,Why do you think that the daylight would kill them?
01:18:57.315,01:18:58.692,Are you mad?
01:19:00.068,01:19:01.278,I told you.
01:19:02.571,01:19:03.780,I already told you!
01:19:03.864,01:19:06.783,The children are photosensitive! The light will kill them!
01:19:06.867,01:19:09.453,"Yes, but that was before."
01:19:10.078,01:19:12.497,The condition could have cleared up by itself.
01:19:15.167,01:19:16.960,how do you know they're not cured?
01:19:17.627,01:19:23.842,My sister-in-law had terrible attacks of rheumatism… in her legs and back.
01:19:24.926,01:19:30.056,Then one fine day… they disappeared.
01:19:31.808,01:19:37.439,I am going to find those curtains… and when you have finished helping me hang them… you will leave this house!
01:19:53.497,01:19:55.832,What has he got to say about all of this?
01:19:56.625,01:19:58.168,Give me your keys.
01:19:58.919,01:20:00.253,I want your keys now!
01:20:05.133,01:20:06.426,I know what you want.
01:20:07.511,01:20:09.054,You want to frighten us.
01:20:09.137,01:20:10.597,"You want to get us out, me and my children."
01:20:10.680,01:20:13.850,You've wanted to take over this house ever since the first day you arrived.
01:20:14.643,01:20:18.188,"Now, you give me those keys. I will not ask again."
01:20:18.522,01:20:19.940,"You should try and calm down, ma'am."
01:20:20.315,01:20:22.734,Give me the keys.
01:20:24.611,01:20:25.737,Give them to me.
01:20:32.285,01:20:33.787,And now get out of here.
01:20:51.972,01:20:53.890,"You know something, Mr. Tuttle?"
01:20:55.141,01:20:57.894,I think I've reached the end of my tether.
01:20:58.186,01:20:59.354,What about you?
01:21:00.480,01:21:03.733,"Oh, yes. Definitely."
01:21:05.485,01:21:07.904,We'd better go and uncover the gravestones.
01:21:47.444,01:21:48.987,What's Mummy doing?
01:21:49.321,01:21:51.239,I've already told you. She's gone mad.
01:21:51.364,01:21:52.449,Liar.
01:21:52.532,01:21:53.408,She's gone mad!
01:21:53.533,01:21:54.659,"Liar, liar!"
01:21:54.784,01:21:57.370,-She's gone mad. -Liar.
01:22:03.376,01:22:04.586,Night-time.
01:22:06.463,01:22:07.714,Where are you going?
01:22:11.301,01:22:13.094,I'm going into the woods to look for Daddy.
01:22:13.595,01:22:15.347,Are you going to run away?
01:22:17.849,01:22:20.894,"If I hang onto the pipe, I can climb down to the ground."
01:22:21.311,01:22:22.562,It's very easy.
01:22:36.493,01:22:39.245,"If Mummy finds out, you're in for it."
01:22:53.468,01:22:55.470,"I want to come and look for Daddy, too."
01:22:55.679,01:22:58.598,Liar. You just don't want to be left on your own.
01:22:58.932,01:23:00.350,"Scaredy-pants, scaredy-pants!"
01:23:00.558,01:23:01.643,Be quiet!
01:23:55.905,01:23:57.866,"Anne, I think we got lost."
01:23:58.283,01:24:00.160,"We still haven't left the garden yet, silly."
01:24:01.327,01:24:02.579,I'm scared.
01:24:02.662,01:24:04.289,"Shouldn't have come, then."
01:24:14.132,01:24:16.801,Let's see. My name is Anne and I'm walking.
01:24:16.885,01:24:18.762,I'm walking and my name is Anne.
01:24:46.206,01:24:47.665,What's that over there?
01:24:49.918,01:24:51.920,I think they're graves.
01:24:55.048,01:24:56.299,Why not?
01:24:56.966,01:24:58.802,What if a ghost jumps out?
01:24:58.885,01:25:01.679,Graves don't have ghosts. Only skeletons.
01:25:19.322,01:25:20.615,There's something written here.
01:25:21.950,01:25:23.159,Wait!
01:25:43.012,01:25:44.013,Oh.
01:25:46.516,01:25:49.435,Anne! What does it say?
01:26:02.490,01:26:05.410,"Mrs. Mills, please don't tell Mummy we've run away."
01:26:05.535,01:26:06.703,Don't speak to them!
01:26:07.912,01:26:08.830,Why?
01:26:10.415,01:26:11.249,What?
01:26:13.877,01:26:14.919,Children!
01:26:19.507,01:26:21.968,Why aren't they wearing sheets and clanking chains?
01:26:22.051,01:26:25.930,You said that-- I don't care what I said! Get away from them!
01:26:26.055,01:26:30.018,You're always teasing me and telling lies… and I'm sick of it!
01:26:30.143,01:26:32.645,I'm not teasing you! I'm telling the truth!
01:26:32.729,01:26:34.063,Come here!
01:26:42.405,01:26:43.865,Children!
01:26:51.706,01:26:52.749,Run!
01:26:53.249,01:26:55.335,Go! Into the house!
01:27:00.798,01:27:01.883,Don't move!
01:27:09.933,01:27:14.520,Tuberculosis finished us off… more than half a century ago.
01:27:44.550,01:27:45.760,What do you want?
01:27:45.843,01:27:48.346,"Mummy, don't open the door. Don't."
01:27:48.763,01:27:50.598,We've seen their graves.
01:27:50.765,01:27:52.058,Go upstairs and hide.
01:28:01.359,01:28:02.610,Don't separate!
01:28:02.694,01:28:03.611,Oh!
01:28:10.368,01:28:12.161,"Whatever you do, don't separate."
01:28:13.955,01:28:16.916,Go hide. Go. Go.
01:28:23.381,01:28:24.841,Understand what?
01:28:24.966,01:28:26.092,About the house.
01:28:26.884,01:28:28.928,About the new situation.
01:28:32.056,01:28:37.520,We must all learn to live together… the living and the dead.
01:28:37.603,01:28:38.604,Oh.
01:28:38.938,01:28:42.108,"If you're dead, leave us in peace!"
01:28:43.526,01:28:45.153,Leave us in peace!
01:28:53.661,01:28:55.538,In here. Get inside.
01:29:06.257,01:29:07.216,Who?
01:29:07.467,01:29:08.801,The intruders.
01:29:10.178,01:29:11.304,There are no intruders.
01:29:13.222,01:29:14.349,There are no intruders.
01:29:17.226,01:29:21.189,And now they're in there with you and the children.
01:29:21.522,01:29:22.565,Waiting for you.
01:29:22.690,01:29:23.733,No!
01:29:28.488,01:29:29.697,they'll find you.
01:29:30.948,01:29:32.492,"Listen, wait here, and I'll be back in a minute."
01:29:32.575,01:29:35.536,"No, no, no. Mummy said we shouldn't separate."
01:29:35.620,01:29:37.538,We can't leave her on her own.
01:29:42.376,01:29:44.087,Stop breathing like that.
01:29:52.136,01:29:54.138,"Nicholas, stop breathing like that."
01:29:57.558,01:29:58.726,Stop breathing!
01:30:01.354,01:30:04.607,Can't you hear it? There's someone there.
01:30:20.957,01:30:22.041,Nicholas?
01:30:24.710,01:30:25.753,Anne?
01:30:28.631,01:30:29.799,Where are you?
01:30:33.344,01:30:34.637,Answer me!
01:30:35.221,01:30:36.597,The intruders have found them.
01:30:36.889,01:30:38.641,There's nothing we can do now.
01:30:39.684,01:30:43.437,You'll have to go upstairs and talk to them.
01:31:05.084,01:31:06.502,hallowed be Thy name.
01:31:07.170,01:31:12.842,Thy kingdom come… Thy will be done on earth… as it is in Heaven.
01:31:14.010,01:31:42.663,Give us this day our daily bread… and forgive us our trespasses… Tell me what happened.
01:31:51.631,01:31:54.550,"If I tell her, they'll leave us in peace."
01:32:00.181,01:32:01.349,Mummy.
01:32:01.933,01:32:04.310,"Why are you crying, children?"
01:32:05.603,01:32:07.813,What happened in this room?
01:32:09.065,01:32:11.651,What did your mother do to you?
01:32:24.372,01:32:26.207,Something about a pillow.
01:32:26.791,01:32:29.252,Is that how she killed you?
01:32:32.838,01:32:34.048,She didn't kill us!
01:32:36.008,01:32:38.594,why do you remain in this house?
01:32:43.641,01:32:44.809,We're not dead!
01:32:46.269,01:32:47.645,We're not dead!
01:32:47.770,01:32:49.021,We're not dead!
01:32:53.359,01:32:55.945,We're not dead. We're not dead.
01:32:57.196,01:33:00.491,We're not dead!
01:33:01.617,01:33:03.995,We're not dead!
01:33:06.747,01:33:07.623,Oh!
01:33:21.470,01:33:25.349,"Yes. Just a bit dizzy, that's all."
01:33:27.184,01:33:28.311,What happened?
01:33:29.395,01:33:32.023,They made contact.
01:33:32.606,01:33:34.066,All three?
01:33:34.317,01:33:36.235,"Apparently, yes."
01:33:37.236,01:33:39.113,The mother and the two children.
01:33:40.865,01:33:42.491,"Quite interesting, don't you think?"
01:33:44.493,01:33:46.370,I was scared out of my wits!
01:33:46.454,01:33:47.413,"Darling, calm down."
01:33:47.496,01:33:52.418,"No. So far, we have handled this matter your way… but now you listen to me."
01:33:52.793,01:33:55.046,We can't possibly stay in this house any longer.
01:33:55.338,01:33:58.632,It is quite clear these beings do not want us to live here.
01:33:58.716,01:34:00.009,We don't know anything about them yet.
01:34:02.261,01:34:06.640,"We know the woman went mad… smothered her two children, and then shot herself."
01:34:07.016,01:34:10.061,That's quite enough. Think of our son.
01:34:10.144,01:34:11.604,There's nothing wrong with Victor.
01:34:11.729,01:34:14.607,"Yes, there is! He has nightmares."
01:34:14.690,01:34:18.694,He says he has seen that girl… and even this lady has been possessed by her.
01:34:19.028,01:34:21.614,"Please, let us leave this house."
01:34:21.947,01:34:23.157,All right.
01:34:24.075,01:34:26.160,We will leave tomorrow morning.
01:34:26.827,01:34:28.662,"Oh, thank God for that."
01:34:30.956,01:34:32.750,I'll just go and check on Victor.
01:34:35.920,01:34:38.089,"Once again, thank you so much for coming."
01:34:38.172,01:34:39.340,A pleasure.
01:34:39.423,01:34:41.008,I hope we've been of some help.
01:34:52.436,01:34:59.860,what the pillow was doing in my hands… or why you didn't move.
01:35:04.698,01:35:06.158,But then I knew.
01:35:09.870,01:35:10.996,It had happened.
01:35:15.376,01:35:17.503,I had killed my children.
01:35:24.301,01:35:25.803,I got the rifle.
01:35:28.597,01:35:30.141,I put it to my forehead.
01:35:34.728,01:35:36.313,Then I pulled the trigger.
01:35:41.318,01:35:42.445,Nothing.
01:35:50.119,01:35:53.080,Then I heard your laughter in the bedroom.
01:35:54.957,01:36:00.963,Ah… You were playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened.
01:36:04.133,01:36:20.316,"And I thought… the Lord in His great mercy… was giving me another chance… telling me, Don't give up."
01:36:23.986,01:36:25.321,Be strong.
01:36:27.865,01:36:28.991,Be a good mother.
01:36:31.660,01:36:32.912,For them.
01:36:37.333,01:36:48.677,But now… now… what does all this mean?
01:36:53.641,01:36:54.767,Where are we?
01:37:00.147,01:37:03.108,when she realized the three of us were dead.
01:37:04.485,01:37:07.363,And that was the last time she ever spoke.
01:37:09.990,01:37:12.117,But I couldn't tell you that before now.
01:37:24.838,01:37:28.592,The intruders are leaving… but others will come.
01:37:29.176,01:37:31.345,"Now, sometimes we'll sense them."
01:37:31.428,01:37:33.973,"Other times, we won't."
01:37:35.432,01:37:37.226,But that's the way it's always been.
01:37:40.396,01:37:41.355,Ma'am.
01:37:47.987,01:37:50.447,"Daddy died in the war, didn't he?"
01:37:52.533,01:37:54.034,Will we ever see him again?
01:37:55.077,01:37:56.161,I don't know.
01:37:58.080,01:38:01.417,"If we're dead, where's limbo?"
01:38:06.088,01:38:08.465,I don't know if there even is a limbo.
01:38:11.677,01:38:13.470,I'm no wiser than you are.
01:38:16.765,01:38:18.559,But I do know that I love you.
01:38:20.978,01:38:22.563,I've always loved you.
01:38:26.817,01:38:28.777,And this house is ours.
01:38:30.863,01:38:31.947,You say it with me.
01:38:33.866,01:38:35.367,This house is ours.
01:38:36.660,01:38:42.082,This house is ours.
01:38:59.516,01:39:03.062,"Mummy, look. It doesn't hurt any more."
01:39:13.947,01:39:16.158,No one can make us leave this house.
01:39:43.352,01:39:44.520,"Come along, Victor."
