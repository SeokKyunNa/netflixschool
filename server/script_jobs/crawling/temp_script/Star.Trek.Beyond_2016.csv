00:01:31.842,00:01:33.510,of the Fibonan Republic.
00:01:34.011,00:01:44.438,"I bring you a message of goodwill and present to you, esteemed members of the Teenaxi Delegation, a gift from the Fibonan High Council with the highest regard."
00:01:47.566,00:01:49.109,What's wrong with it?
00:01:50.360,00:01:51.278,"Uh, excuse me?"
00:01:51.403,00:01:53.030,Why don't they want it anymore?
00:01:53.196,00:02:05.000,"Uh, well, this was once a piece of an ancient weapon, and now they offer it as a symbol of-- of peace. In the Fibonan culture, to surrender a weapon is an offer of truce."
00:02:05.083,00:02:06.460,How did they come by it?
00:02:06.543,00:02:08.837,They told me they acquired it a long time ago.
00:02:09.171,00:02:10.547,"So they stole it, then."
00:02:11.423,00:02:14.551,"No, they, um... Well, I don't know."
00:02:14.635,00:02:17.220,You don't know the Fibonans like we do!
00:02:19.765,00:02:24.728,They're a crowd of untrustworthy thieves who want to see us murdered in our own beds!
00:02:24.978,00:02:29.274,This beloved artifact is a symbol of trust and peace.
00:02:29.358,00:02:32.486,They want to chop us into pieces and roast us over a fire!
00:02:32.569,00:02:34.029,"No, no. I don't think that's true."
00:02:37.949,00:02:38.825,What?
00:03:16.113,00:03:17.406,Scotty!
00:03:27.708,00:03:28.917,How'd it go?
00:03:31.586,00:03:34.005,"Captain, did you manage to broker a treaty with the Teenaxi?"
00:03:34.089,00:03:36.508,Uh... Let's just say I came up short.
00:03:36.675,00:03:41.096,"Would you, uh, lo-- log that and put it in the vault, Spock? Thank you."
00:03:41.471,00:03:42.973,"Jim, you look like crap."
00:03:43.306,00:03:44.307,"Thank you, Bones."
00:03:44.391,00:03:47.227,You got that little vein popping out of your temple again. You okay?
00:03:47.310,00:03:49.646,Never better! Just another day in the fleet.
00:04:03.660,00:04:10.834,"Today is our 966th day in deep space, a little under three years into our five-year mission."
00:04:13.253,00:04:20.927,"The more time we spend out here, the harder it is to tell where one day ends and the next one begins."
00:04:24.556,00:04:29.227,It can be a challenge to feel grounded when even gravity is artificial.
00:04:30.353,00:04:33.231,"But, well, we do what we can to make it feel like home."
00:04:36.818,00:04:42.949,"The crew, as always, continues to act admirably despite the rigors of our extended stay here in outer space..."
00:04:45.243,00:04:47.704,and the personal sacrifices they have made.
00:04:48.747,00:04:53.752,We continue to search for new life forms in order to establish firm diplomatic ties.
00:04:54.294,00:04:58.632,Our extended time in uncharted territory has stretched the ship's mechanical capacities.
00:04:58.715,00:05:04.095,"But fortunately our engineering department, led by Mr. Scott, is more than up to the job."
00:05:05.555,00:05:12.103,"The ship aside, prolonged cohabitation has definitely had effects on interpersonal dynamics."
00:05:13.438,00:05:15.357,Some experiences for the better...
00:05:16.775,00:05:18.568,and some for the worse.
00:05:24.407,00:05:28.995,"As for me, things have started to feel a little episodic."
00:05:30.205,00:05:35.460,"The farther out we go, the more I find myself wondering what it is we're trying to accomplish."
00:05:36.253,00:05:38.839,"If the universe is truly endless, then..."
00:05:39.464,00:05:42.384,are we not striving for something forever out of reach?
00:05:44.469,00:05:50.725,"The Enterprise is scheduled for a reprovisioning stop at Yorktown, the Federation's newest and most advanced starbase."
00:05:51.309,00:05:57.148,Perhaps a break from routine will offer up some respite from the mysteries of the unknown.
00:06:13.248,00:06:14.416,Sorry I'm late.
00:06:14.624,00:06:23.758,"Keenser's leaking some kind of highly acidic green goo, and Scotty's terrified he's gonna sneeze on the warp core What the hell are you drinking?"
00:06:24.134,00:06:28.138,"Uh, I'm pretty sure it's the rest of that Saurian brandy we picked up on Thasus."
00:06:28.513,00:06:30.724,"My God, man, are you trying to go blind?"
00:06:31.182,00:06:32.517,That stuff's illegal.
00:06:33.894,00:06:37.272,"Besides, I found this in Chekov's locker."
00:06:38.690,00:06:39.900,-Wow. -Right?
00:06:39.983,00:06:43.278,"I mean, I always assumed he'd be -a vodka man. -A vodka guy, exactly."
00:06:43.528,00:06:46.114,I wanted to have something appropriate for your birthday.
00:06:46.448,00:06:49.576,"Ah, that's in a couple days. You know I don't care about that."
00:06:49.743,00:06:54.956,I know. I know you don't like celebrating it on the day because it's also the day your pa bit the dust.
00:06:55.040,00:06:56.082,I was being sensitive.
00:06:56.374,00:06:59.127,Did they teach you about bedside manner in medical school?
00:07:00.587,00:07:02.172,It's just your southern charm.
00:07:13.350,00:07:15.101,"-Oh, yeah. That's good. -Ooh."
00:07:19.230,00:07:20.607,Are you gonna call your mom?
00:07:21.149,00:07:22.901,"Yeah, of course. I'll call her on the day."
00:07:26.738,00:07:28.114,I'm one year older.
00:07:29.532,00:07:31.701,"Yep, that's usually how it works."
00:07:33.286,00:07:35.580,A year older than he ever got to be.
00:07:38.625,00:07:40.585,He joined Starfleet because he...
00:07:41.920,00:07:43.088,he believed in it.
00:07:45.882,00:07:47.175,I joined on a dare.
00:07:48.385,00:07:50.512,You joined to see if you could live up to him.
00:07:52.055,00:07:59.270,"Uh, you spent all this time trying to be George Kirk, and now you're wondering just what it means to be Jim."
00:07:59.729,00:08:01.189,Why you're out here.
00:08:04.234,00:08:07.570,To perfect eyesight and a full head of hair.
00:08:15.203,00:08:16.538,approaching Yorktown base.
00:08:16.621,00:08:18.123,"I'm on my way, Mr. Sulu."
00:08:22.877,00:08:25.672,"Yeah, you know me. Mr. Sensitive."
00:08:32.929,00:08:35.140,"Aye, she's a beauty, isn't she?"
00:08:35.265,00:08:37.642,What a damn monstrosity!
00:08:37.809,00:08:39.644,Couldn't we just rent some space on a planet?
00:08:39.811,00:08:44.774,Showing geographical favoritism among inducted Federation worlds could cause diplomatic tension.
00:08:44.858,00:08:46.151,"Oh, you don't think that looks tense?"
00:08:46.317,00:08:49.446,Looks like a damn snow globe in space just waiting to break!
00:08:50.989,00:08:52.824,"Oh, that's the spirit, Bones."
00:10:15.990,00:10:17.033,Spock!
00:10:18.868,00:10:20.036,Do you have a moment?
00:10:21.371,00:10:22.413,"Of course, Nyota."
00:10:23.498,00:10:25.416,I think you should have this back.
00:10:26.042,00:10:27.377,"After all, it belonged to your mother."
00:10:27.460,00:10:32.841,It's not in the Vulcan custom to receive again that which was given as a gift.
00:10:43.768,00:10:44.686,You guys break up?
00:10:46.896,00:10:47.772,What'd you do?
00:10:48.898,00:10:51.109,"A typically reductive inquiry, Doctor."
00:10:52.569,00:10:56.990,"You know, Spock, if an Earth girl says, uh, It's me, not you..."
00:11:04.330,00:11:06.499,Excuse me. Commander Spock?
00:11:07.542,00:11:09.335,May we have a moment of your time?
00:11:12.422,00:11:13.882,You know I've never been here?
00:11:13.965,00:11:16.467,What I hear is that the bars here are excellent.
00:11:33.776,00:11:35.612,Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
00:11:37.405,00:11:38.698,Live long and prosper.
00:12:49.894,00:12:52.146,Unidentified. Non-Federation.
00:12:52.230,00:12:53.481,"Attention, unidentified vessel."
00:12:53.564,00:12:55.441,You are not authorized for approach.
00:12:55.608,00:12:57.568,Power down and await instructions.
00:13:00.446,00:13:02.657,"Unidentified vessel, please comply."
00:13:28.057,00:13:31.060,We were on a science mission inside the nebula.
00:13:31.686,00:13:35.690,Our ship suffered a critical malfunction.
00:13:36.566,00:13:38.234,I took an escape pod...
00:13:39.902,00:13:42.905,before the ship crash landed on a nearby planet.
00:13:44.282,00:13:45.575,We need a ship...
00:13:46.451,00:13:48.911,capable of navigating the nebula.
00:13:51.122,00:13:52.707,You must have someone...
00:13:53.416,00:13:54.751,who can help us.
00:13:59.881,00:14:04.719,"to a sector of uncharted nebula, here at 210 mark 14."
00:14:06.137,00:14:08.931,"-Uh, long-range scan? -No data."
00:14:09.057,00:14:12.143,The nebula is too dense. It's uncharted space.
00:14:13.144,00:14:16.230,"Well, the Enterprise does have the best navigational system in the fleet."
00:14:17.148,00:14:22.737,-She could handle it. -The only ship here with more advanced technology is still under construction.
00:14:23.529,00:14:25.948,But it's not just the ship that I'm sending.
00:14:27.909,00:14:29.827,-I'll gather the crew. -Captain.
00:14:31.371,00:14:37.126,Starfleet command sent me your application for the Vice Admiral position here at this installation.
00:14:37.919,00:14:39.504,"Yes, ma'am. Um..."
00:14:41.631,00:14:43.049,"If I may, I would..."
00:14:43.716,00:14:47.261,recommend Commander Spock replace me as Captain of the Enterprise.
00:14:48.096,00:14:52.100,He is an exemplary Starfleet officer. He'd make a great captain.
00:14:53.810,00:15:00.108,"It isn't uncommon, you know, even for a captain, to want to leave."
00:15:01.275,00:15:04.821,There is no relative direction in the vastness of space.
00:15:05.655,00:15:10.326,"There is only yourself, your ship, your crew."
00:15:11.786,00:15:14.497,"It's easier than you think, to get lost."
00:15:14.997,00:15:17.333,-It's not about-- -I'll bring it up with the General Council.
00:15:17.417,00:15:18.835,We'll discuss it when you return.
00:15:20.586,00:15:21.629,Ma'am.
00:15:31.973,00:15:33.850,-Mr. Spock. -Captain.
00:15:36.352,00:15:40.440,"-I was thinking-- -Perhaps there-- -No, please. -Captain, after you."
00:15:40.565,00:15:41.566,I insist.
00:15:43.818,00:15:46.404,"After this mission, we should, uh, sit down."
00:15:46.571,00:15:48.406,There's something I need to talk to you about.
00:15:48.489,00:15:50.241,I as well have something to share.
00:15:56.831,00:15:58.583,We make a good team. Right?
00:16:00.877,00:16:01.878,I believe we do.
00:16:06.632,00:16:07.550,I insist.
00:16:27.904,00:16:29.739,"Lieutenant Uhura, open a ship-wide channel."
00:16:29.864,00:16:30.990,"Yes, Captain."
00:16:34.327,00:16:35.828,"Attention, crew of the Enterprise."
00:16:36.829,00:16:39.332,Our mission is straightforward.
00:16:40.082,00:16:43.669,Rescue a crew stranded on a planet in uncharted space.
00:16:44.086,00:16:50.801,"Our trajectory will take us through an unstable nebula, one which will disable all communications with Starfleet."
00:16:51.761,00:16:52.929,We're gonna be on our own.
00:16:53.804,00:16:57.016,The Enterprise has something no other ship in the fleet has...
00:16:58.017,00:16:58.935,you.
00:17:00.269,00:17:03.523,"And as we've come to understand, there is no such thing as the unknown..."
00:17:05.816,00:17:07.151,only the temporarily hidden.
00:17:08.486,00:17:09.570,Kirk out.
00:17:29.006,00:17:32.677,"Mmm. Readings indicate cloud density diminishing, sir."
00:18:02.873,00:18:06.502,Approaching Altamid. Class-M planet.
00:18:07.086,00:18:08.879,Massive subterranean development.
00:18:08.963,00:18:11.382,But limited to no life forms on the surface.
00:18:11.507,00:18:12.466,"Proximity alert, sir!"
00:18:12.550,00:18:14.302,We have an unknown ship heading right for us.
00:18:14.468,00:18:16.095,"-Lieutenant Uhura, hail them. -Yes, Captain."
00:18:24.437,00:18:26.147,I am picking up some kind of signal.
00:18:29.483,00:18:30.568,They're jamming us.
00:18:31.569,00:18:33.070,"Magnify, Mr. Sulu."
00:18:39.619,00:18:40.745,What is this?
00:18:52.131,00:18:53.215,Fire at will!
00:19:01.223,00:19:05.686,"Sir, our phasers are having minimal effect, and our torpedoes can't track their movements!"
00:19:05.770,00:19:07.063,Fire everything we've got.
00:19:07.188,00:19:09.273,"Captain, we are not equipped for this manner of engagement."
00:19:20.618,00:19:22.662,"Shield frequencies have no effect, sir!"
00:19:22.745,00:19:25.373,They took out the dish! Shields are inoperable!
00:19:27.249,00:19:29.418,"-Warp us out of here, Mr. Sulu. -Yes, sir."
00:19:37.510,00:19:38.719,Why the hell aren't we moving?
00:19:38.803,00:19:40.554,"I can't engage the warp drive, sir!"
00:19:44.684,00:19:46.811,"Scotty, I need warp now!"
00:19:48.938,00:20:00.491,"I cannae, sir! The nacelles, they've-- They've gone!"
00:20:01.534,00:20:04.286,"Security, engage all emergency procedures."
00:20:04.370,00:20:06.497,Active protocol 28 Code One Alpha Zero.
00:20:32.273,00:20:38.404,"Sir, I have hull breaches in levels 12 to 15, 6, 9, 31 and 21, sir."
00:20:38.487,00:20:43.492,Captain! There's a chance I can reroute the energy reserves from the warp core to the impulse engines.
00:20:43.659,00:20:45.745,"If we can get back into the nebula, maybe we could lose them."
00:20:45.828,00:20:47.204,"Do whatever you have to, Scotty."
00:20:47.830,00:20:49.874,Wee man! Let's go.
00:21:59.735,00:22:02.696,Fit the plasma conduits and stand by to reroute on my mark!
00:22:19.839,00:22:22.216,Secure the ship.
00:22:27.596,00:22:30.599,I have identified the individual who appears to be leading the attack party.
00:22:31.559,00:22:38.148,He infiltrated the archive vault and removed the artifact -from our mission on Teenax. -Hold your distance until-- Spock!
00:22:38.482,00:22:39.400,Spock!
00:22:40.401,00:22:41.986,"You two, with me. Sulu, you have the conn."
00:22:42.236,00:22:43.112,"Yes, sir."
00:23:10.973,00:23:12.182,What the hell?
00:23:20.524,00:23:21.984,"Doctor, we must evacuate now!"
00:23:58.312,00:24:00.022,Captain...
00:24:00.940,00:24:02.107,Kirk.
00:24:20.709,00:24:23.045,Yes! We are at 100% impulse.
00:24:23.128,00:24:24.546,"Great work, Mr. Scott!"
00:24:24.630,00:24:26.382,Maximum impulse towards the nebula.
00:25:57.014,00:25:58.140,Kirk to Bridge.
00:26:01.602,00:26:03.353,"Systems are failing ship-wide, Captain."
00:26:03.896,00:26:08.734,"Emergency bulkheads are sealing, but structural integrity is at 18% and falling, sir!"
00:26:09.943,00:26:11.820,"Abandon ship, Mr. Sulu."
00:26:14.114,00:26:15.199,Sound the alarm.
00:26:21.538,00:26:23.165,We need to give those pods a chance to escape.
00:26:23.248,00:26:24.958,Can you lead those ships away?
00:26:25.042,00:26:28.128,Impulse engines are still trying to draw power from the warp reserve.
00:26:28.212,00:26:31.006,We cannot move until the saucer is separated.
00:26:32.508,00:26:33.759,I'll handle it.
00:26:34.176,00:26:35.511,"Aye-aye, sir."
00:26:42.684,00:26:46.230,"You okay? Oh, my God. Get him up. Help him up."
00:26:47.439,00:26:48.440,Got you.
00:26:48.524,00:26:50.400,We've got to get you guys to an escape pod. Go.
00:26:50.526,00:26:51.944,Go! Ensign Syl.
00:26:54.530,00:26:55.531,I need your help.
00:26:56.573,00:26:57.616,"Yes, sir."
00:27:28.981,00:27:30.315,My God.
00:27:30.691,00:27:32.484,"Spock, they're taking the crew!"
00:27:35.571,00:27:38.574,All personnel evacuate immediately.
00:28:08.770,00:28:09.688,Are you okay?
00:28:09.813,00:28:11.231,The saucer should be free by now!
00:30:05.679,00:30:08.765,Impulse engines drawing power from auxiliary generators.
00:30:26.616,00:30:27.617,None.
00:30:28.035,00:30:29.619,But if I'm reading this correctly...
00:30:30.454,00:30:31.747,the intruders are taking them.
00:30:34.833,00:30:36.918,We cannot pull away.
00:30:41.965,00:30:43.467,Get to your Kelvin Pods.
00:30:44.009,00:30:45.635,"-Yes, sir. -Aye, Captain."
00:30:45.719,00:30:46.928,"Come on, let's go!"
00:30:57.481,00:30:58.482,Let's go.
00:30:59.733,00:31:00.734,Come on.
00:33:25.587,00:33:28.131,You knew. You knew we'd be attacked.
00:33:38.600,00:33:40.560,Yes. I lied.
00:33:42.020,00:33:44.356,Our ship was attacked.
00:33:46.274,00:33:48.568,"Chekov, check the comms for survivors."
00:33:48.652,00:33:50.070,"-Aye, aye, Captain. -Who is he?"
00:33:53.782,00:33:56.660,He took my crew. Like he took yours.
00:33:57.452,00:33:59.329,How did he know so much about the Enterprise?
00:34:00.163,00:34:02.958,All I know is that if I did this...
00:34:05.085,00:34:06.878,he would set them free.
00:34:06.962,00:34:09.464,"Chekov, are you picking anything up on those scanners?"
00:34:10.840,00:34:12.259,"Nothing, sir."
00:34:14.010,00:34:15.845,"-What if they... -No, no."
00:34:17.013,00:34:18.181,He was taking them.
00:34:18.640,00:34:20.058,We have to find that saucer.
00:34:20.141,00:34:23.270,Even minimal scanning systems will have more range than a tricorder.
00:34:23.478,00:34:25.063,"Aye, Captain, it's possible."
00:34:26.189,00:34:27.190,Captain.
00:34:27.983,00:34:29.818,I was protecting my crew.
00:35:30.253,00:35:32.255,What is your name?
00:35:34.716,00:35:36.593,How do you know our language?
00:35:36.968,00:35:39.262,I know your kind.
00:35:40.930,00:35:43.892,I am Lieutenant Nyota Uhura of the U.S.S. Enterprise.
00:35:43.975,00:35:47.395,And you have committed an act of war against the-- Federation!
00:35:50.106,00:35:53.068,Federation is an act of war.
00:35:53.735,00:35:55.240,You attacked us.
00:36:00.116,00:36:01.201,Your captain...
00:36:03.370,00:36:06.790,Why did you sacrifice yourself for him?
00:36:07.415,00:36:08.750,He would have done the same.
00:36:09.668,00:36:12.879,"And if he made it off of that ship, he will come for us."
00:36:14.214,00:36:19.094,"I am counting on it, Lieutenant Uhura."
00:36:48.039,00:36:49.582,I can't believe it.
00:36:59.634,00:37:01.261,"My God, Spock."
00:37:03.805,00:37:04.806,God...
00:37:05.557,00:37:06.891,Sit down over here.
00:37:07.851,00:37:09.936,"Okay. Okay, sit. Easy."
00:37:14.315,00:37:15.442,Okay.
00:37:15.525,00:37:18.153,"Now, just try and relax. You're gonna be okay."
00:37:18.236,00:37:23.658,The forced optimism in your voice suggests that you are trying to elicit a sense of calm in order to-- I'll cut the horseshit.
00:37:23.742,00:37:29.998,"Doctor, I fail to see how excrement of any kind Whoa, what the hell are you doing?"
00:37:30.081,00:37:31.249,"We must keep moving, Doctor."
00:37:31.332,00:37:33.126,"Spock, this thing's punctured your iliac region!"
00:37:33.209,00:37:34.210,Time is a critical factor.
00:37:34.294,00:37:35.758,That's exactly what I'm trying to tell you.
00:37:35.837,00:37:38.047,"Look, if I can't take this out, you're gonna die."
00:37:38.131,00:37:41.259,"Okay? If I take it out and can't stop the bleeding, you're gonna die."
00:37:41.384,00:37:43.052,I can see no appeal in either option.
00:37:43.219,00:37:45.054,"Believe it or not, neither can I."
00:37:46.848,00:37:55.523,"So, if I remember correctly, the Vulcans have their hearts where humans have their livers."
00:37:55.607,00:37:56.816,"That is correct, Doctor."
00:37:57.859,00:37:59.611,That explains a thing or two.
00:38:02.363,00:38:04.741,"You know, you're lucky. An inch to the left..."
00:38:07.869,00:38:09.370,And you'd be dead already.
00:38:10.789,00:38:12.290,"I just don't get it, Spock."
00:38:12.832,00:38:15.168,"I mean, what... what did they attack us for?"
00:38:15.335,00:38:18.463,"I mean, they do all this for some..."
00:38:18.588,00:38:20.840,doodad that the tiny critters didn't want?
00:38:21.007,00:38:24.803,"It is unwise to trivialize that which one simply does not understand, Doctor."
00:38:25.261,00:38:27.972,We can safely assume it is more important than a doodad.
00:38:29.182,00:38:31.684,"I think you just managed to insult me twice, Spock."
00:38:38.817,00:38:39.734,Okay.
00:38:40.443,00:38:42.695,"All right, Spock, I just got one question."
00:38:43.780,00:38:46.199,-What's your favorite color? -I fail to see the relevance.
00:38:51.663,00:38:54.374,Yeah. They say it hurts less if it's a surprise.
00:38:55.583,00:39:01.214,"If I may adopt a parlance with which you are familiar, I can confirm your theory to be... horseshit."
00:39:04.801,00:39:06.344,We got to get out of here.
00:39:08.263,00:39:09.305,Come on.
00:39:44.465,00:39:45.550,Hello there.
00:39:46.259,00:39:49.429,"My name is Montgomery Scott. And, uh, who might you be?"
00:39:52.056,00:39:53.224,"Watch it, sonny."
00:39:53.308,00:39:55.226,"I'm pretty handy when I want to be, all right?"
00:40:43.066,00:40:45.026,"We certainly showed them, eh, lassie?"
00:40:46.069,00:40:48.446,"That's Starfleet property, okay? You cannae just take it."
00:40:48.571,00:40:51.032,"Uh, but I'm feeling generous today, so have at it."
00:40:52.742,00:40:54.035,Where you get that?
00:40:54.285,00:40:55.912,-Is that English? -I learn it from my house.
00:40:56.037,00:40:58.122,-Where you get that? -It's my Starfleet insignia.
00:40:58.331,00:40:59.499,What does it mean?
00:40:59.666,00:41:02.752,"Means that I'm an officer of Starfleet. Uh, engineering division."
00:41:04.587,00:41:06.673,-Engineering? -That's right. I fix things.
00:41:06.756,00:41:08.007,I know what is engineering.
00:41:10.593,00:41:12.845,"You're not with those bastards that killed my ship, are you?"
00:41:14.597,00:41:15.932,I'll take that as a no.
00:41:18.142,00:41:20.269,He is Krall. Him and his...
00:41:21.562,00:41:22.522,bees.
00:41:22.605,00:41:25.358,They search the stars for a death machine.
00:41:25.441,00:41:28.569,They're the reason why you here. Why we are all here.
00:41:29.112,00:41:30.613,Even those three scunners?
00:41:32.031,00:41:34.575,"They have fallen from the sky, like me and you."
00:41:37.370,00:41:39.163,Come with me. Now!
00:41:39.789,00:41:41.040,"Wait, no-- Hang on a minute, lassie."
00:41:41.124,00:41:42.333,I'm having a difficult day here.
00:41:43.084,00:41:44.711,I've got to find my crewmates.
00:41:46.087,00:41:47.964,I will help you find your mates.
00:41:48.047,00:41:49.799,And then you will help me.
00:41:50.883,00:41:51.843,With what?
00:41:53.344,00:41:54.721,You want me to fix something?
00:41:54.804,00:41:57.306,"Yes. You help me, and I help you."
00:41:58.850,00:42:02.979,"All right, well, things being as they are, I doubt I'll get a better offer today, so, lead the way."
00:42:03.271,00:42:05.481,Good. I am Jaylah.
00:42:06.149,00:42:08.651,"-And you are Montgomery Scott. -Aye, Scotty."
00:42:10.111,00:42:11.863,"Come now, Montgomery Scotty."
00:42:14.449,00:42:15.491,"All right, hold up."
00:42:32.091,00:42:33.468,The Enterprise.
00:42:34.969,00:42:39.223,"She may not even have power to the Bridge, Captain."
00:42:42.143,00:42:44.437,She still has a few tricks up her sleeve.
00:42:46.814,00:42:47.940,I'd bet on it.
00:42:50.526,00:42:52.278,McCoy to Enterprise. Come in.
00:42:53.321,00:42:54.864,McCoy to Enterprise.
00:42:57.909,00:42:59.160,"Hey, take it easy there, Spock."
00:42:59.243,00:43:01.120,That was just a temporary fix back there.
00:43:08.961,00:43:10.171,Fascinating.
00:43:10.588,00:43:12.548,Ominous. Dark. Dangerous.
00:43:16.177,00:43:17.345,We're going in.
00:43:41.369,00:43:43.621,depicted on the artifact taken in the attack.
00:43:43.704,00:43:45.289,You think it came from here?
00:43:46.541,00:43:47.875,It would seem so.
00:43:52.255,00:43:53.464,"Damn it, Spock."
00:43:55.424,00:43:56.717,Easy. Easy.
00:44:05.476,00:44:07.895,-Are we there yet? -Stop asking that.
00:44:08.396,00:44:10.523,-Sorry. -This is the way. Come.
00:44:11.899,00:44:15.027,And watch your steps. You do not want to set off my traps.
00:44:16.863,00:44:18.948,Oh. That's clever.
00:44:20.199,00:44:21.534,What is this place?
00:44:22.243,00:44:24.745,-This is my house. -Your house?
00:44:25.329,00:44:27.915,Hold on a minute. Is this a ship?
00:44:28.249,00:44:31.586,I help you find your friends and you help me fix it.
00:44:31.836,00:44:33.880,So I can leave this planet forever.
00:44:38.593,00:44:40.303,"No, Montgomery Scotty."
00:44:41.929,00:44:43.139,It's yours.
00:44:44.682,00:44:46.142,"Oh, my good Lord."
00:45:42.865,00:45:45.534,I will try to reroute power to it.
00:45:46.369,00:45:47.370,Work fast.
00:45:47.453,00:45:50.081,"Once we get this place lit up, we're gonna draw a lot of attention."
00:45:56.337,00:45:58.464,to modulate for the crew's signals.
00:46:18.526,00:46:20.069,"Nice job, Keenser."
00:46:22.238,00:46:25.157,"All right, we got about 15 minutes until the next guard rotation. Come on."
00:46:50.725,00:46:52.476,This is the Magellan Probe.
00:46:53.269,00:46:56.022,The Federation was using these to find a way through the nebula.
00:46:56.647,00:46:58.190,What's he using it for?
00:47:26.218,00:47:27.261,What do you see?
00:47:30.806,00:47:33.934,He's been piggybacking the subspace links between the probes.
00:47:35.019,00:47:36.979,Can we use it to send a distress signal?
00:47:37.563,00:47:38.439,I can try.
00:47:43.861,00:47:45.279,It's sent.
00:47:45.363,00:47:47.531,He's accessed the Yorktown database.
00:47:47.615,00:47:48.616,What?
00:47:49.158,00:47:52.078,"He's got Starfleet data files, ship logs..."
00:47:52.953,00:47:54.622,including the Enterprise.
00:47:55.998,00:47:58.292,He's been watching us this whole time.
00:48:15.684,00:48:18.145,the artifact was on the ship the whole time?
00:48:18.479,00:48:22.191,"I couldn't afford to get caught with it, so I hid it in here."
00:48:32.660,00:48:34.954,Do you believe every sad story you hear?
00:48:40.292,00:48:41.877,Put the phaser down.
00:48:42.837,00:48:43.879,Please.
00:48:47.925,00:48:49.301,"You get it, Chekov?"
00:48:49.718,00:48:52.263,"Aye, Captain, I have traced the location of her call."
00:48:59.061,00:49:00.938,What does Krall want with this thing?
00:49:04.191,00:49:05.526,from yourselves.
00:49:05.943,00:49:07.027,Captain!
00:49:51.655,00:49:54.658,"-You all right? -Aye, Captain, but we are trapped!"
00:50:05.377,00:50:06.712,Can you get this thing started?
00:50:06.795,00:50:09.340,Are you intimating that we should engage the thrusters?
00:50:09.423,00:50:11.050,I am open to other suggestions.
00:50:15.763,00:50:17.556,"-There is a problem, sir. -What?"
00:50:17.640,00:50:20.142,"The fuel is primed, but I cannot get it to combust."
00:50:20.559,00:50:24.438,"Oy, Captain, we are basically standing on a very large bomb."
00:50:24.522,00:50:27.149,"-If you miss the combustion compressor-- -I'm not gonna miss, come on."
00:50:27.233,00:50:29.360,Do you even know what the combustion compressor looks like?
00:50:29.443,00:50:30.486,"It's square, right?"
00:50:30.736,00:50:32.363,"No, sir, it's round."
00:50:32.446,00:50:33.489,That's what I said.
00:50:40.746,00:50:41.872,Run!
00:50:57.304,00:50:58.514,Go!
00:51:22.746,00:51:23.998,Chekov!
00:51:57.406,00:51:58.866,Chekov! Move!
00:52:59.718,00:53:04.223,what sacrifice really means?
00:53:07.601,00:53:13.607,Federation has taught you that conflict should not exist.
00:53:14.608,00:53:15.567,Ha!
00:53:19.196,00:53:20.781,But without struggle...
00:53:22.741,00:53:26.745,you would never know who you truly are.
00:53:27.454,00:53:29.039,You have no idea who we are.
00:53:30.708,00:53:32.084,But you'll soon find out.
00:53:33.127,00:53:37.423,You mean the distress signal you thought you sent?
00:53:40.634,00:53:42.511,The coordinates were altered.
00:53:43.804,00:53:49.393,Your rescue ships will be stranded in the nebula and your base left vulnerable.
00:53:51.311,00:53:53.147,You're going to attack Yorktown.
00:53:53.772,00:53:59.069,Millions of souls from every Federation world holding hands.
00:54:00.320,00:54:01.989,It's a perfect target.
00:54:02.614,00:54:05.909,You're wrong. There is strength in unity.
00:54:10.664,00:54:16.920,"The strength of others, Lieutenant, is what has kept me alive."
00:54:18.172,00:54:19.465,No!
00:54:45.908,00:54:47.451,"Spock, wake up, damn it!"
00:54:50.704,00:54:52.664,"I am entirely conscious, Doctor."
00:54:53.582,00:54:56.251,I'm simply contemplating the nature of mortality.
00:54:57.544,00:54:59.713,"Feeling philosophical, huh?"
00:55:07.137,00:55:10.307,You asked me why Lieutenant Uhura and I parted ways.
00:55:11.934,00:55:18.315,"I became concerned, in the light of Vulcan's demise, that I owed a debt of duty to my species."
00:55:20.234,00:55:23.153,"You thought you should be off making little Vulcans, huh?"
00:55:25.030,00:55:27.324,"Yeah, I can see how that would upset her."
00:55:28.575,00:55:33.580,"I intended to discuss it with her further, but I received some news which affected me unexpectedly."
00:55:36.250,00:55:37.292,What news?
00:55:39.378,00:55:41.255,Ambassador Spock has died.
00:55:43.924,00:55:44.967,Oh.
00:55:45.968,00:55:47.553,"Spock, I'm so sorry."
00:55:51.098,00:55:54.101,I can't imagine what that must feel like.
00:56:00.732,00:56:03.318,When you've lived as many lives as he...
00:56:05.112,00:56:06.947,fear of death is illogical.
00:56:09.575,00:56:11.034,Fear of death...
00:56:12.744,00:56:14.788,is what keeps us alive.
00:56:19.334,00:56:21.003,I want to live as he did.
00:56:24.673,00:56:26.341,That is why I decided...
00:56:27.342,00:56:30.178,to redirect my efforts and continue his work...
00:56:31.471,00:56:32.556,on New Vulcan.
00:56:36.351,00:56:38.103,You're leaving Starfleet?
00:56:42.608,00:56:44.693,What did Jim have to say about that?
00:56:46.320,00:56:49.948,I could not find the time to tell him.
00:56:50.490,00:56:52.701,"Well, I can tell you he's not gonna like that."
00:56:54.119,00:56:56.622,"Hell, I don't know what he'd do without you."
00:56:57.664,00:57:01.168,"I mean, you know, me on the other hand, I'd throw a party, but..."
00:57:10.010,00:57:12.262,"My God, you're getting delirious."
00:57:18.518,00:57:20.562,How far are we from the coordinates of that call?
00:57:20.854,00:57:22.189,"Still a ways, sir."
00:57:23.231,00:57:24.399,-Captain? -Yeah.
00:57:24.942,00:57:27.235,When did you begin to suspect her?
00:57:29.404,00:57:30.614,Not soon enough.
00:57:31.615,00:57:32.658,How did you know?
00:57:33.533,00:57:34.534,Well...
00:57:35.160,00:57:38.497,I guess you could say I've got a good nose for danger.
00:57:42.084,00:57:43.251,Run!
00:57:53.387,00:57:54.680,Is that music?
00:57:54.763,00:57:56.306,Where on earth is that coming from?
00:57:57.474,00:57:58.558,There.
00:58:00.268,00:58:03.730,I plugged the little box in the power cell and the little mouths make it sing.
00:58:06.566,00:58:11.655,"Music's a bit old-fashioned for my taste, not to mention very loud and distracting, but, aye, well played."
00:58:12.739,00:58:15.242,"-I like the beats and shouting. -Oh, you do?"
00:58:20.247,00:58:21.748,"-Switch it off. -Ach, you're okay."
00:58:26.545,00:58:28.505,Someone set off one of my traps.
00:58:52.154,00:58:53.321,Captain?
00:58:53.989,00:58:55.907,"-You know these men? -Aye, lassie."
00:58:55.991,00:58:58.326,-That wee man there is Pavel Chekov. -Hello.
00:58:58.410,00:59:01.163,And that handsome bastard is James T. Kirk.
00:59:01.288,00:59:03.373,"They're my mates. It's good to see you, sir."
00:59:05.125,00:59:06.626,"What is she doing, Scotty?"
00:59:06.835,00:59:09.421,"-Don't hurt them. No, don't! -Hit her!"
00:59:12.424,00:59:13.800,"You're free, James T."
00:59:13.884,00:59:15.135,There we go.
00:59:22.851,00:59:24.394,Who's your new friend here?
00:59:25.479,00:59:27.064,She sure knows how to throw out a welcome mat.
00:59:32.736,00:59:34.154,"I'm sorry, you're the only ones."
00:59:34.279,00:59:36.531,"What the hell happened up there, Jim? Why were we attacked?"
00:59:36.615,00:59:39.076,They were after the artifact we brought back from Teenax.
00:59:39.159,00:59:40.202,-Did they get it? -No.
00:59:40.285,00:59:43.330,"-Have you got it? -No. I had to get it off the Enterprise, put it on a shuttle."
00:59:43.413,00:59:44.581,-You hid it in a shuttle. -Yes.
00:59:46.208,00:59:47.209,And no.
01:00:01.348,01:00:04.518,"This is the U.S.S. Franklin, sir. Can you believe it?"
01:00:04.768,01:00:06.978,First Earth ship capable of warp four.
01:00:07.145,01:00:10.148,Went missing in the Gagarin Radiation Belt in the early 2160s.
01:00:11.733,01:00:13.110,Captain Balthazar Edison.
01:00:13.693,01:00:15.278,One of the first heroes of Starfleet.
01:00:15.362,01:00:17.155,How the hell did his ship end up here?
01:00:17.239,01:00:18.615,"There's a lot of theories, sir."
01:00:18.698,01:00:21.952,Surrendered to the Romulans. Captured by a giant green space hand.
01:00:22.035,01:00:24.287,"This far out, it's got to be a wormhole displacement."
01:00:24.371,01:00:25.497,Can she fly?
01:00:25.580,01:00:32.546,"She's missing a few driver coils and the EPS conduits are fried, but Jaylah has done a marvelous job of getting the ship's systems back online."
01:00:32.629,01:00:34.339,"Thank you, Montgomery Scotty."
01:00:34.506,01:00:35.715,Pardon me.
01:00:37.259,01:00:39.469,"Mr. Chekov, can you plug in the coordinates."
01:00:39.553,01:00:42.055,See if you can track the crew's location from the ship's sensors.
01:00:42.180,01:00:43.223,"Aye, Captain."
01:00:45.183,01:00:47.018,"-Tour. -Yes, the mess hall."
01:00:47.102,01:00:48.895,"-Jaylah, if you will. -Yes."
01:01:11.459,01:01:13.587,"No clue what happened to the crew, huh?"
01:01:13.712,01:01:16.089,"No, sir. They'd be dead a hundred years by now."
01:01:20.552,01:01:21.720,Is that a...
01:01:22.470,01:01:24.306,That's a PX70!
01:01:26.933,01:01:27.809,Wow.
01:01:28.810,01:01:31.313,My dad used to have one when he was a kid.
01:01:31.938,01:01:35.442,"My mom said he'd put her on the back of it, drive her nuts."
01:01:40.405,01:01:41.406,Um...
01:01:44.242,01:01:46.703,"So you're telling me this thing's been here this whole time, and..."
01:01:46.786,01:01:48.288,no one's ever noticed it?
01:02:02.302,01:02:03.428,Here.
01:02:11.353,01:02:14.564,"I have intercepted a weak communications transmission, sir."
01:02:14.648,01:02:16.107,It's a Starfleet frequency.
01:02:21.196,01:02:22.989,"Yes, but how do we get to them?"
01:02:25.951,01:02:27.452,But I'm gonna need your permission.
01:02:28.036,01:02:29.287,Why would you need my permission?
01:02:29.371,01:02:32.082,"Because if I mess it up, I don't want it to be just my fault."
01:02:35.293,01:02:38.672,"McCoy and Spock to Enterprise crew. Come in, Enterprise crew."
01:02:39.422,01:02:40.507,Anyone.
01:02:45.345,01:02:46.596,"Come on, Spock."
01:02:51.059,01:02:55.146,"Leaving me behind will significantly increase your chances of survival, Doctor."
01:02:55.230,01:02:58.024,"Well, that's damn chivalrous of you, but completely out of the question."
01:02:58.108,01:03:01.027,It is imperative that you locate any surviving crew.
01:03:01.111,01:03:02.779,And here I was thinking you cared.
01:03:10.745,01:03:12.414,"Of course I care, Leonard."
01:03:14.749,01:03:17.502,I always assumed my respect for you was clear.
01:03:20.338,01:03:24.175,"The dialog we have had across the years has always-- It's okay, Spock."
01:03:25.051,01:03:26.636,You don't have to say it.
01:03:30.265,01:03:32.892,"Well, at least I won't die alone."
01:03:39.024,01:03:40.608,"Well, that's just typical."
01:03:44.863,01:03:46.948,"Come on, you bastards!"
01:03:53.830,01:03:55.915,"-Oh. -Good to see you in one piece, Doctor."
01:03:56.458,01:03:57.625,"Oh, am I?"
01:03:58.168,01:04:00.003,I feel like my innards have been to a barn dance!
01:04:00.086,01:04:04.341,"Aye, well, these old transporters were only ever used for cargo, but a few modifications seem to do the trick."
01:04:04.424,01:04:08.845,"I thought it best to beam you one at a time, though. You know, -in case you got spliced. -Oh."
01:04:09.929,01:04:11.681,I couldn't imagine a worse scenario.
01:04:12.182,01:04:14.934,"-Good to have you back. You all right? -Yeah, I'm fine. He's hurt."
01:04:15.018,01:04:16.895,"I am functioning adequately, Captain."
01:04:16.978,01:04:18.146,"In a pig's eye, you are!"
01:04:18.229,01:04:26.404,"Captain, we discovered that the stolen artifact Are there any medical supplies on this thing?"
01:04:26.488,01:04:27.364,This way.
01:04:33.161,01:04:35.246,All right. Lie down. Come on.
01:04:40.001,01:04:44.881,"How are we gonna get out of this one, Spock? We've got no ship, no crew. Not the best odds."
01:04:45.006,01:04:46.549,"We will do what we have always done, Jim."
01:04:46.674,01:04:49.052,We will find hope in the impossible.
01:04:49.135,01:04:50.470,"Let's get you patched up first, okay?"
01:04:50.553,01:04:51.471,"No, Captain."
01:04:51.971,01:04:53.890,You must focus your efforts on helping the crew.
01:04:54.057,01:04:56.017,"Well, that's why I need you around, Spock."
01:04:59.479,01:05:01.022,These things are from the dark ages.
01:05:08.154,01:05:09.823,Should stop the internal hemorrhaging.
01:05:10.115,01:05:11.366,At least that's my hope.
01:05:11.866,01:05:14.285,The miserable have no other medicine but only hope.
01:05:16.162,01:05:18.331,Death's door and he's quoting Shakespeare.
01:05:25.839,01:05:27.382,"The mission, routine investigation..."
01:05:29.759,01:05:32.971,He must have hidden it somewhere.
01:05:40.979,01:05:45.733,"What seemed so clear to me two years ago now seems, well, far away."
01:05:48.862,01:05:51.072,You will tell me where it is!
01:05:51.406,01:05:52.365,Now!
01:05:56.828,01:05:58.079,Stop! Stop!
01:05:59.706,01:06:01.416,Let him go and I will give you what you want!
01:06:01.541,01:06:03.126,"No! Syl, don't!"
01:06:27.567,01:06:32.405,"Lieutenant, unity is not your strength."
01:06:35.241,01:06:36.826,It is your weakness.
01:07:12.487,01:07:15.114,We should wait until we're absolutely sure.
01:07:15.198,01:07:17.742,"No, we have to get the crew back now."
01:07:18.368,01:07:21.120,"Chekov has the coordinates that can lead us to Krall's base, so we go!"
01:07:23.635,01:07:24.582,when she called him?
01:07:24.666,01:07:26.793,"Even if he was, we don't know that the crew is even with him."
01:07:26.876,01:07:32.090,"-Or if they're even still alive. -Mr. Chekov, can you reconfigure the search parameters in order to compensate for this formula?"
01:07:36.469,01:07:38.012,"It is Vokaya, Mr. Chekov."
01:07:38.221,01:07:40.723,A mineral unique to Vulcan which emits low-level radiation.
01:07:41.266,01:07:43.851,I will have to filter out all other energy emissions.
01:07:44.102,01:07:47.063,"Spock, what the hell would a Vulcan mineral be doing way out here?"
01:07:47.146,01:07:48.189,Where are you going with this?
01:07:48.273,01:07:52.735,Lieutenant Uhura wears a Vokaya amulet which I presented to her as a token of my affection and respect.
01:07:53.486,01:07:55.363,You gave your girlfriend radioactive jewelry?
01:07:57.282,01:07:59.325,But its unique signature makes it very easy to identify.
01:07:59.909,01:08:01.828,You gave your girlfriend a tracking device.
01:08:05.873,01:08:07.041,That was not my intention.
01:08:08.585,01:08:10.545,I'm glad he doesn't respect me.
01:08:21.180,01:08:22.181,Huh.
01:08:22.515,01:08:26.060,I am detecting a very trace amount of Vokaya.
01:08:26.185,01:08:29.397,"Does the location match the coordinates you acquired from Kalara, Mr. Chekov?"
01:08:30.189,01:08:31.232,"It is a match, sir."
01:08:31.316,01:08:36.529,Its presence suggests that Lieutenant Uhura and thereby the rest of the crew are being held at Krall's base of operation.
01:08:36.779,01:08:37.989,Can you beam them out?
01:08:38.531,01:08:43.536,"No, sir. There is some geological interference that is blocking the transporter signal."
01:08:43.620,01:08:46.623,"Well, I guess we're gonna have to go in and break them out the old-fashioned way."
01:08:50.209,01:08:52.378,"Everyone who goes there, he kills."
01:08:53.921,01:08:56.132,You've-- You've been there? You've seen it?
01:08:56.549,01:08:58.176,"Well, why didn't you say something, lassie?"
01:08:58.259,01:09:00.470,Because I know you will ask me to take you there.
01:09:02.555,01:09:05.725,"If your friends are there, then they will die, just like my family."
01:09:06.476,01:09:08.645,And I will not go back to that death place!
01:09:08.728,01:09:11.773,"Aye, but if you've escaped, then you can show us the way in and the way out."
01:09:11.898,01:09:14.651,"No! This is not the deal we made, Montgomery Scotty."
01:09:17.070,01:09:19.364,"If you choose to do this, you are on your own."
01:09:20.281,01:09:21.324,Wait.
01:09:21.658,01:09:22.617,Let her go.
01:09:22.700,01:09:24.243,"She's lost people, too, Captain."
01:09:33.586,01:09:35.505,"Look, that's our friends out there, lassie. Right?"
01:09:35.672,01:09:37.548,We cannae just leave them behind.
01:09:41.469,01:09:43.388,"We just need you to be brave, is all."
01:09:45.348,01:09:49.894,"When we were in that place, Krall would come and take someone."
01:09:50.937,01:09:52.230,There were screams.
01:09:52.647,01:09:54.315,I can still hear them.
01:09:56.067,01:09:57.944,And we would not see that person again.
01:09:58.027,01:09:59.987,We did not know who would be next.
01:10:06.035,01:10:07.995,My father planned an escape.
01:10:08.371,01:10:11.541,But we were seen by the one they call Manas.
01:10:15.002,01:10:18.214,My father fought him so I could get out.
01:10:19.173,01:10:22.635,He was brave and Manas killed him.
01:10:25.054,01:10:26.764,What you want is impossible.
01:10:30.143,01:10:31.519,"Look, maybe it's not."
01:10:32.687,01:10:36.023,"Right. My wee granny used to say, Ya cannae break a stick in a bundle."
01:10:37.734,01:10:40.069,"You're part of something bigger now, lassie."
01:10:40.570,01:10:42.113,Right? Dinnae give up on that.
01:10:42.196,01:10:44.198,'Cause we'll sure as hell never give up on you.
01:10:44.282,01:10:46.200,That is what being part of a crew is all about.
01:10:48.327,01:10:50.496,"Is that what you believe in, James T.?"
01:10:53.249,01:10:55.376,All I know is we stand a better chance with you.
01:11:01.174,01:11:02.425,That's how I got out.
01:11:02.508,01:11:04.093,So that'll be our way in.
01:11:04.177,01:11:09.432,"An away team will beam to the other side of the tunnel, follow it to Krall's base, get inside the building and break out the crew."
01:11:09.557,01:11:14.061,"Uh, Captain, we cannot lock onto anyone inside the crater in order to beam them out."
01:11:14.145,01:11:16.189,"Oh, I could rig up pulse beacons as pattern enhancers."
01:11:16.272,01:11:17.607,That'd get the signal out of the crater.
01:11:17.690,01:11:20.193,-All right. -How many people can the Franklin transport at a time?
01:11:20.276,01:11:24.197,"Uh, with a wee bit of modification, 20 max, but I'm not sure how long it would hold out."
01:11:24.280,01:11:30.787,"Bones, Mr. Chekov, Jaylah, you're with me on the away team. Mr. Scott, modify that transporter and then do everything you can to get this ship operational."
01:11:30.870,01:11:35.458,"Captain, Mr. Chekov's technical acumen makes him more valuable aboard the Franklin with Mr. Scott."
01:11:35.541,01:11:37.502,It is thereby logical that I would replace him.
01:11:37.919,01:11:40.338,"Why is that logical, Spock? You just got back on your feet."
01:11:41.172,01:11:43.299,"Lieutenant Uhura is in that facility, Jim."
01:11:46.677,01:11:48.095,I'll keep an eye on him.
01:11:48.888,01:11:49.764,Understood.
01:11:50.264,01:11:53.643,But his soldiers are everywhere. We won't pass unseen.
01:11:53.726,01:11:55.353,What we require is a diversion.
01:12:02.068,01:12:03.694,I think I have an idea.
01:12:28.636,01:12:31.180,This is Abronath.
01:12:32.306,01:12:35.852,It was used by the Ancient Ones as a weapon.
01:12:36.435,01:12:40.022,"But when they could not control its deadly power, they..."
01:12:40.481,01:12:47.280,"split it into two and ejected the halves into space, hoping it would be lost forever."
01:12:51.367,01:12:53.202,But I am grateful.
01:12:54.120,01:13:02.879,"I have spent lifetimes searching for it, only to have you find it for me."
01:13:11.929,01:13:17.351,"The world that I was born into is very different from yours, Lieutenant."
01:13:17.435,01:13:20.104,We knew pain. We knew terror.
01:13:20.187,01:13:23.274,Struggle made us strong.
01:13:23.357,01:13:26.360,Not peace. Not unity.
01:13:26.444,01:13:30.448,These are myths the Federation would have you believe.
01:13:34.994,01:13:36.746,Those are strong words.
01:13:37.163,01:13:40.291,"You might even believe them, but there's something else going on with you."
01:13:40.708,01:13:42.043,Something underneath.
01:13:45.880,01:13:47.131,Wait.
01:13:47.757,01:13:49.342,What are you doing with her?
01:13:50.843,01:13:52.887,You already got what you wanted! Let her go!
01:13:53.679,01:13:54.805,Syl!
01:14:35.388,01:14:38.683,The Federation has pushed the frontier for centuries.
01:14:38.766,01:14:40.434,But no longer.
01:14:40.935,01:14:43.062,"This is where it begins, Lieutenant."
01:14:46.607,01:14:49.735,This is where the frontier pushes back.
01:15:03.082,01:15:04.166,This way.
01:15:21.308,01:15:22.476,Where is she?
01:15:43.372,01:15:45.583,"I've got to admit, that's a hell of a distraction."
01:15:46.792,01:15:48.335,Your friends are over there.
01:15:51.505,01:15:52.423,Come on.
01:15:56.427,01:15:58.262,You've brought us this far.
01:15:58.429,01:16:00.556,"Finish the mission, Krall."
01:16:41.639,01:16:44.100,"Commander. Uhura, they took her."
01:16:47.019,01:16:48.687,Get the remainder of the crew to safety.
01:16:49.772,01:16:51.273,"Come on, let's go! Move!"
01:16:53.776,01:16:55.903,-Stay in the circle. -Come on! Hurry!
01:17:00.032,01:17:01.617,"Okay, Mr. Chekov, increase the signal."
01:17:01.700,01:17:03.202,We're gonna grab them 20 at a time.
01:17:03.285,01:17:05.121,-Aye. -Let's hope this doesn't get messy.
01:17:05.204,01:17:06.497,Energize!
01:17:41.907,01:17:42.908,Spock.
01:17:43.325,01:17:44.827,What are you doing here?
01:17:46.620,01:17:49.415,"Clearly, I am here to rescue you."
01:17:49.999,01:17:51.041,Let's go.
01:17:59.008,01:18:00.176,"Good to see you, wee man."
01:18:29.580,01:18:31.373,just like your father.
01:19:22.091,01:19:24.260,"Ten seconds until the transporter's recharged, Doctor."
01:19:24.343,01:19:26.303,-Wait for my signal. -Doctor!
01:19:26.387,01:19:28.097,"Damn it, man, we're not leaving without them!"
01:19:31.058,01:19:32.726,Come on. Let's go. Move!
01:19:32.810,01:19:34.103,Let's go! Come on!
01:20:02.715,01:20:04.091,"Scotty, do you have everybody?"
01:20:04.216,01:20:07.177,"Aye, sir. Everyone except you and Jaylah. Hit the beacon and we'll grab you."
01:20:23.277,01:20:24.278,"Captain, your beacon!"
01:20:54.933,01:20:56.518,-There it is! -Energize.
01:21:00.314,01:21:01.607,"Jaylah, now!"
01:21:15.454,01:21:18.415,Okay... Let's never do that again.
01:21:18.874,01:21:20.292,"I agree, James T."
01:21:27.341,01:21:30.677,Yorktown. He's gonna destroy Yorktown.
01:21:35.474,01:21:37.142,and you make it fly.
01:21:39.978,01:21:42.064,"Scotty, can you get this thing started?"
01:21:42.147,01:21:44.108,"Started, yes. Flying, sir, that's a different thing."
01:21:44.191,01:21:45.776,"These old vessels, they were built in space."
01:21:45.859,01:21:47.903,They were never supposed to take off from atmosphere.
01:21:48.195,01:21:49.446,Make it happen.
01:21:51.490,01:21:52.797,You're telling me this now?
01:21:52.897,01:21:56.236,"Because I didn't want to disappoint you, you know, in case you didn't make it back."
01:21:56.537,01:21:58.414,"-How thoughtful, Mr. Scott. -Captain."
01:22:05.587,01:22:06.672,He's launching.
01:22:13.637,01:22:16.223,The attack on Yorktown may be just the beginning.
01:22:16.807,01:22:23.605,"Armed with this bio-weapon, he could rid it of all life and use the base's advanced technology to attack an untold number of Federation planets."
01:22:25.816,01:22:27.651,Then we're just gonna have to get this thing flying.
01:22:27.734,01:22:29.445,"We cannae just jumpstart it, sir!"
01:22:37.369,01:22:40.956,Dilithium chambers at 70% and climbing.
01:22:41.039,01:22:43.709,Primary support engines standing by.
01:22:45.878,01:22:47.087,Mr. Sulu.
01:22:47.337,01:22:50.757,"You can, you know, fly this thing, right?"
01:22:52.468,01:22:53.552,"You kidding me, sir?"
01:22:54.136,01:22:55.179,Fantastic.
01:22:58.182,01:22:59.641,"Ready as she'll ever be, sir."
01:22:59.725,01:23:03.145,"That's what I like to hear. All right. Bones, where are we with the crew?"
01:23:04.688,01:23:06.440,but otherwise we're secure down here.
01:23:06.857,01:23:12.821,"Mr. Sulu, we have to achieve terminal velocity in order for the stabilizers to provide lift."
01:23:12.905,01:23:15.782,Are you sure this drop is high enough to do that?
01:23:17.034,01:23:18.410,We'll find out.
01:23:27.252,01:23:29.129,"Call it, Mr. Sulu."
01:23:29.254,01:23:30.506,"Aye-aye, Captain."
01:23:31.006,01:23:34.092,"Mr. Chekov, be ready to hit the forward stabilizers full on my mark."
01:23:34.176,01:23:35.636,-One quarter impulse. -Aye.
01:23:57.574,01:23:59.368,"One half impulse, Mr. Chekov."
01:23:59.826,01:24:00.744,Aye.
01:24:02.454,01:24:04.039,We should belt up. Go on. Go!
01:24:13.590,01:24:15.926,"Easy, Mr. Sulu. Let's not break her in half."
01:24:51.336,01:24:53.589,"Any time, Mr. Sulu."
01:24:58.385,01:24:59.761,"Now, Mr. Chekov!"
01:26:12.584,01:26:14.836,IFF alert on incoming vessel.
01:26:15.629,01:26:18.340,No reply to all-frequency I.D. request.
01:26:18.423,01:26:19.466,Visual.
01:26:32.979,01:26:34.314,Red alert! Red alert!
01:26:45.283,01:26:48.161,Look how far they've come.
01:26:55.752,01:26:58.839,Please proceed to designated safety zones immediately.
01:27:02.968,01:27:05.262,from every frequency coming from Yorktown.
01:27:06.680,01:27:08.682,Krall's already started his attack.
01:27:08.765,01:27:10.767,"Mr. Scott, what kind of weapons do we have?"
01:27:11.184,01:27:14.438,"Uh, we have pulsed phase cannons and spatial torpedoes."
01:27:14.813,01:27:15.897,Great. Lock and load.
01:27:15.981,01:27:18.567,It does not matter. You cannot defeat the bees.
01:27:18.650,01:27:20.861,"Maybe, uh, maybe we lure them away."
01:27:20.944,01:27:23.280,How do we get Yorktown time to get people to safety?
01:27:23.363,01:27:25.407,"No, we are a horse and buggy compared to those things."
01:27:25.490,01:27:27.784,"We're barely holding together as it is, Captain."
01:27:27.868,01:27:31.413,"Captain, the flight patterns of bees are determined by individual decisions."
01:27:31.496,01:27:36.585,Krall's swarm formations are too complex not to rely on some form of unified cyberpathic coordination.
01:27:36.668,01:27:38.920,-I surmise that if we-- -Spock! Skip to the end.
01:27:39.254,01:27:42.632,What he's saying is that if we disorient the swarm we can kick its ass!
01:27:43.508,01:27:44.509,Precisely.
01:27:45.677,01:27:47.554,"Scotty, can you beam me onto one of those swarm ships?"
01:27:47.679,01:27:48.972,Have you gone completely mad?
01:27:49.055,01:27:51.683,-Yes or no? -No! Yes!
01:27:51.767,01:27:52.768,Maybe.
01:27:52.851,01:27:58.231,"Captain, my familiarity of the interior of those ships, however brief, makes me more qualified for this away mission."
01:27:58.607,01:27:59.983,"Spock, you're still hurt."
01:28:00.567,01:28:01.485,"She's right, Spock."
01:28:03.695,01:28:05.405,I acknowledge and respect your concerns.
01:28:06.740,01:28:12.245,Perhaps you would feel more confident if I were accompanied by someone with familiarity of both the ship and my injury.
01:28:13.789,01:28:15.123,He's gonna love this.
01:28:17.000,01:28:18.251,You want me to do what?
01:28:22.214,01:28:23.882,"Why, you green-blooded ingrate."
01:28:23.965,01:28:25.217,This was your idea!
01:28:25.759,01:28:27.052,"It's a good idea, Bones."
01:28:27.135,01:28:31.223,"You know, next time you have a piece of pipe stuck in your transverse, call a plumber."
01:28:31.306,01:28:33.016,Just make sure you find a way to break those things.
01:28:33.099,01:28:34.851,"If it gets hairy, I'll beam you straight back."
01:28:34.935,01:28:35.811,Energize.
01:28:38.396,01:28:52.077,"Damn it, Jim, I'm a doctor, not a-- we crashed."
01:28:59.167,01:29:00.001,Hit something.
01:29:00.752,01:29:03.296,"-Spock to Franklin. -Spock, we read you."
01:29:03.380,01:29:09.219,"Captain, from what I can ascertain, the ships do indeed share a cyberpathic link which coordinates their actions. Patching it through now."
01:29:10.220,01:29:11.847,That's what that signal was.
01:29:13.223,01:29:15.517,"They weren't jamming us, they were talking to each other."
01:29:15.600,01:29:17.853,"Well, how do we get them to stop talking?"
01:29:17.936,01:29:19.479,What about electromagnetic focusing?
01:29:19.563,01:29:21.356,"We could use the transporters, disrupt their network."
01:29:23.233,01:29:28.488,"If we could plant some sort of disruptive communication signal inside the swarm, it might adversely affect their capacity to coordinate."
01:29:28.655,01:29:31.116,It would have to be at a frequency they will not anticipate.
01:29:31.199,01:29:33.827,We could cause a chain reaction that would wipe out the whole swarm.
01:29:33.910,01:29:37.747,"Sir, a closed network like that might be susceptible to very high frequency."
01:29:38.248,01:29:39.374,VHF.
01:29:39.916,01:29:43.378,Radio. We can broadcast something from the ship to drown out their link.
01:29:43.461,01:29:45.046,Something loud and distracting.
01:29:45.130,01:29:46.548,Loud and distracting?
01:29:47.966,01:29:49.259,I've got just the thing!
01:29:49.801,01:29:51.261,Do not break my music.
01:29:51.386,01:29:53.179,Break it? You're getting an upgrade.
01:30:06.735,01:30:08.904,Swarm ships are 60 seconds from breaking through!
01:30:08.987,01:30:12.324,I've just got to reconfigure the VHF output into a multiphasic sweep.
01:30:12.407,01:30:14.910,"-Let me do it. -Oh, lassie-- Let her do it."
01:30:20.540,01:30:22.584,"There, see? Simple."
01:30:22.792,01:30:25.045,"All right. Captain, we're ready to broadcast."
01:30:25.128,01:30:28.089,But the signal won't travel far. We have to get closer.
01:30:28.173,01:30:30.050,-How close? -Very.
01:30:30.133,01:30:32.093,"Intercept course, Mr. Sulu."
01:30:32.594,01:30:34.012,Put us right in the middle of that thing.
01:30:34.095,01:30:35.055,"Yes, sir."
01:30:47.525,01:30:48.985,My old friend.
01:31:00.288,01:31:01.957,The swarm ships are doubling back!
01:31:02.040,01:31:03.750,"They are forming an attack wave, sir."
01:31:03.833,01:31:05.251,I think we got their attention.
01:31:05.335,01:31:07.337,"Hold steady, Mr. Sulu. Brace yourselves, everybody."
01:31:07.420,01:31:09.172,"Spock, stand by to drop out of formation."
01:31:09.255,01:31:11.466,"-Scotty, you all cued up back there? -Aye, sir!"
01:31:11.549,01:31:13.802,Ready to broadcast at 57.7 megahertz.
01:31:13.885,01:31:14.928,"Made your choice, lassie?"
01:31:40.286,01:31:41.705,Let's make some noise.
01:31:50.338,01:31:51.548,That's a good choice.
01:32:05.103,01:32:08.148,"Faster, Doctor. We risk being consumed by their trajectorial decay."
01:32:08.273,01:32:09.482,Damn backseat driver.
01:32:10.316,01:32:12.736,"-Evade, Doctor! -I see it, I see it!"
01:32:32.297,01:32:33.882,Is that classical music?
01:32:35.341,01:32:37.218,"Yes, Doctor, it would seem to be."
01:32:37.886,01:32:40.889,"Lieutenant Uhura, make sure Yorktown has the frequency to broadcast."
01:32:44.059,01:32:45.977,"Sir, we now have the disruption frequency."
01:32:46.311,01:32:47.479,Broadcast.
01:33:08.500,01:33:13.171,"-You two all right, Spock? -We are fine, Captain, but there are still three ships heading into Yorktown."
01:33:13.254,01:33:15.256,"That's got to be Krall. Keep on him, Spock."
01:33:15.340,01:33:18.551,Do whatever it takes to stop him from using that weapon.
01:33:37.654,01:33:39.405,My house is breaking!
01:33:39.489,01:33:42.075,We've lost the polarization of the hull plating!
01:33:42.200,01:33:44.077,I can reroute the power from the dilithium chambers.
01:33:44.160,01:33:45.245,I need you.
01:33:45.495,01:33:47.288,"And I need you, Jaylah. Let's go!"
01:34:12.897,01:34:14.274,"Do not lose them, Doctor."
01:34:14.357,01:34:16.401,"You're more than welcome to switch places with me, Spock."
01:34:37.755,01:34:40.967,"Captain, intercepting all three ships is an impossibility."
01:34:45.388,01:34:47.265,Get me a schematic of Yorktown!
01:34:48.600,01:34:50.643,There! Yorktown headquarters!
01:34:50.727,01:34:53.521,"Mr. Chekov, can you do a bioscan of Central Plaza."
01:34:53.605,01:34:54.606,Aye.
01:34:54.689,01:34:56.357,They are clearing civilians.
01:34:56.441,01:34:58.318,"Bones, there's a city plaza coming up."
01:34:58.401,01:35:00.486,You gotta make sure Krall heads for it.
01:35:00.570,01:35:02.363,-Why? -Just do it!
01:35:17.545,01:35:19.380,"Sulu, get us up there."
01:35:19.464,01:35:20.757,Hold onto something!
01:36:17.814,01:36:19.774,Now I've just got to figure out how to land.
01:36:26.739,01:36:29.492,"Captain, I have three hull breaches from the impact."
01:36:29.701,01:36:32.370,"Deck three, the cargo bay, and the engine room."
01:36:33.204,01:36:35.748,"All right, Sulu, Chekov, check the cargo bay and Deck three."
01:36:35.832,01:36:39.252,We need confirmation that the weapon has been neutralized and Krall is dead!
01:37:05.236,01:37:07.822,It's Krall. We've seen him do this.
01:37:07.905,01:37:11.326,It's some kind of energy transference. It physically changes him.
01:37:11.409,01:37:14.829,He must still be on board. We would have seen him leave.
01:37:16.789,01:37:20.001,"Sulu, contact Yorktown security and lock down the ship."
01:37:20.084,01:37:21.127,Let's go.
01:37:44.484,01:37:45.860,It's about damn time.
01:37:46.944,01:37:48.363,-Are you ready? -Yeah.
01:37:48.446,01:37:50.406,"All right, baby, let's go."
01:37:50.490,01:37:52.325,-It's about damn time. -Push the frontier.
01:37:53.576,01:37:54.869,Captain!
01:38:05.755,01:38:07.590,-It's about damn time. -Push the frontier.
01:38:08.466,01:38:10.385,-It's about damn time. -Push the frontier.
01:38:12.970,01:38:14.305,...frontier.
01:38:14.764,01:38:16.307,...frontier.
01:38:22.271,01:38:23.523,It's him.
01:38:24.774,01:38:27.693,"Scotty, I need you to link into the Franklin database."
01:38:27.777,01:38:30.154,Find out what you can about Balthazar Edison.
01:38:32.031,01:38:33.783,"-Sir, he'll be long dead. -No. He's not."
01:38:34.116,01:38:36.281,"I don't know how, but Edison is Krall."
01:38:47.171,01:38:48.172,What'd you find?
01:38:48.256,01:38:51.296,"Well, his record goes back way before the Federation even existed."
01:38:51.426,01:38:55.972,He was a major in the United Earth Military Assault Command Operation. A lot of off-world combat.
01:38:58.590,01:39:00.852,His military service came to an end when MACO was disbanded.
01:39:03.271,01:39:04.439,We're not a military agency.
01:39:04.836,01:39:06.472,They made him a captain and gave him the Franklin.
01:39:06.791,01:39:08.959,"-Scotty, bring up his logs. -Aye, sir."
01:39:12.738,01:39:16.503,Captain's log... I don't remember the stardate.
01:39:18.151,01:39:20.329,All distress calls unanswered.
01:39:20.926,01:39:25.276,"Of the crew, only three remain."
01:39:25.668,01:39:27.420,I won't allow it!
01:39:30.006,01:39:33.468,The indigenous race abandoned this planet long ago.
01:39:33.741,01:39:38.848,They left behind sophisticated mining equipment and a drone workforce.
01:39:39.198,01:39:45.583,They have some sort of technology that prolongs life.
01:39:46.397,01:39:49.400,I will do whatever it takes for me and my crew.
01:39:49.484,01:39:52.111,The Federation do not care about us.
01:39:57.978,01:40:00.645,You'll probably never see me again.
01:40:00.820,01:40:02.079,But if you do...
01:40:03.873,01:40:05.041,be ready.
01:40:06.950,01:40:08.586,Why has he not used his weapon yet?
01:40:08.825,01:40:11.325,'Cause he wants to find somewhere to inflict maximum damage.
01:40:11.756,01:40:13.132,He needs a distribution system.
01:40:14.532,01:40:16.511,"-They have to circulate air here, right? -Aye, sir."
01:40:16.594,01:40:18.638,There's an atmospheric regulator at the core.
01:40:18.721,01:40:23.851,"Lieutenant, contact Yorktown. Make sure they shut it down How would he access the core?"
01:40:23.976,01:40:28.523,"Uh, well, there's a maintenance tower at the station's gravitational nexus. That's the only way."
01:40:28.687,01:40:30.853,"Scotty, you get over there. Make sure it gets shut down!"
01:40:31.108,01:40:32.401,"Lassie, you're with me."
01:40:45.456,01:40:48.042,"Look, this thing is impossible to shut down."
01:40:48.125,01:40:49.085,"Aye, well..."
01:40:51.462,01:40:52.838,we'll see about that.
01:41:00.388,01:41:01.973,"Mr. Scott, why is that thing still on?"
01:41:02.098,01:41:09.313,"We're working on it, sir, but, as you can imagine, there's a lot of safety protocols surrounding the thing that, you know, -keeps everybody alive. -Figure something out."
01:41:09.397,01:41:10.398,"Be careful, Captain."
01:41:10.481,01:41:13.818,Gravity's gonna get a bit screwy the closer you get to the center.
01:41:13.985,01:41:18.948,"Maybe we should scan the operational schematics, Lassie, I'm need your eyes."
01:41:36.090,01:41:39.093,"What happened to you out there, Edison?"
01:41:41.345,01:41:42.430,Edison.
01:41:45.725,01:41:47.810,"I have to say, Kirk..."
01:41:49.395,01:41:51.772,I've missed being me.
01:41:53.190,01:41:57.278,We lost ourselves but gained a purpose!
01:41:58.237,01:42:04.660,A means to bring the galaxy back to the struggle that made humanity strong.
01:42:05.161,01:42:06.996,I think you underestimate humanity.
01:42:07.163,01:42:08.873,I fought for humanity!
01:42:09.498,01:42:14.128,Lost millions to the Xindi and Romulan Wars.
01:42:14.295,01:42:15.588,And for what?
01:42:16.172,01:42:22.553,For the Federation to sit me in a captain's chair and break bread with the enemy.
01:42:22.970,01:42:24.972,We change. We have to.
01:42:26.474,01:42:29.226,Or we spend the rest of our lives fighting the same battles.
01:43:07.890,01:43:10.101,There's no way you can make it back there.
01:43:13.020,01:43:14.313,Give up.
01:43:15.356,01:43:16.816,"What, like you did?"
01:43:19.235,01:43:23.823,"I read your ship's log, Captain James T. Kirk."
01:43:23.948,01:43:25.825,At least I know what I am.
01:43:27.201,01:43:28.703,I am a soldier.
01:43:29.078,01:43:31.288,"You won the war, Edison."
01:43:32.206,01:43:33.708,You gave us peace.
01:43:36.585,01:43:38.838,is not what I was born into.
01:43:42.258,01:43:43.134,Scotty.
01:43:45.803,01:43:47.430,to carry him back to the center.
01:43:49.765,01:43:50.641,Nah.
01:44:29.513,01:44:30.931,No! No!
01:44:40.065,01:44:42.026,-What's that? -The weapon's in the chamber.
01:44:42.109,01:44:46.197,"Captain, we have to stop the processor now, or everything breathing in Yorktown is dead!"
01:44:55.581,01:44:57.583,You can't stop it.
01:44:59.627,01:45:01.003,You will die.
01:45:01.962,01:45:03.672,Better to die saving lives...
01:45:04.715,01:45:06.383,than to live with taking them.
01:45:07.843,01:45:09.720,That's what I was born into.
01:45:12.056,01:45:13.265,I think we can redirect it.
01:45:13.349,01:45:16.644,There's a sealed construction hatch that will let you vent the weapon into space.
01:45:16.727,01:45:19.814,"Now, we can override the locks from up here, but you will have to activate the hatch."
01:45:19.897,01:45:21.190,So I just hit a button.
01:45:21.273,01:45:24.360,"It's not a button, sir. It's a silver lever under a white panel."
01:45:25.402,01:45:27.154,-Got it! -And there's four of them.
01:45:27.863,01:45:30.866,"Once you've primed the hatch, you'll have to exit the chamber immediately."
01:45:30.991,01:45:34.787,"If the hatch is open when the processor cycles, and you're in it, you're gonna get sucked into space."
01:45:35.412,01:45:36.997,What happens if the hatch isn't open?
01:45:37.081,01:45:38.791,You're gonna get sucked into a big fan.
01:45:38.916,01:45:41.085,"With the weapon, and we all die."
01:45:42.711,01:45:44.672,"Damn it, Jim, you won't make it out in time!"
01:45:57.601,01:45:59.436,"Get out of there, James T.!"
01:46:09.321,01:46:12.074,"-Scotty! -Work fast, Captain, time's running out!"
01:46:12.241,01:46:13.409,He's not gonna make it.
01:47:21.602,01:47:22.561,Whoo-hoo!
01:47:27.566,01:47:29.443,"What would I do without you, Spock?"
01:48:05.562,01:48:07.690,I guess time will judge us all.
01:48:09.775,01:48:11.068,He just got lost.
01:48:11.610,01:48:14.029,"You saved this entire base, Kirk."
01:48:14.863,01:48:17.866,Millions of souls. Thank you.
01:48:18.409,01:48:21.078,It wasn't just me. It never is.
01:48:21.745,01:48:25.624,"Needless to say, the position of Vice Admiral is yours."
01:48:26.542,01:48:28.002,No one deserves it more.
01:48:31.755,01:48:33.757,"Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?"
01:48:35.175,01:48:36.885,No. They don't.
01:48:39.847,01:48:41.640,"Well, no offense, ma'am, but..."
01:48:43.225,01:48:44.685,where's the fun in that?
01:49:49.374,01:49:52.878,"Why would I get it reduced? Bones, we know our way through the nebula now."
01:49:53.420,01:49:54.838,Can you imagine what we'll find!
01:49:54.922,01:49:57.341,Alien despots hell-bent on killing us?
01:49:57.424,01:49:59.593,Deadly space-borne viruses and bacteria?
01:49:59.718,01:50:03.388,Incomprehensible cosmic anomalies that could wipe us out in an instant!
01:50:04.014,01:50:05.349,It's gonna be so much fun.
01:50:07.267,01:50:09.853,"By the way, where are we going? I thought we were gonna get a drink."
01:50:09.978,01:50:12.523,"I know you told me to keep it under wraps, but, uh..."
01:50:17.236,01:50:18.570,Mr. Sensitive?
01:50:19.613,01:50:21.365,"-There you go, laddie. -Thanks, Scotty."
01:50:22.825,01:50:26.787,"Everybody, raise a glass to Captain James T. Kirk."
01:50:32.960,01:50:34.086,And...
01:50:34.962,01:50:36.255,to absent friends.
01:50:42.886,01:50:43.971,Whose round is it?
01:50:44.054,01:50:47.641,"Can I get three, uh, Romulan ales for me?"
01:50:48.308,01:50:50.477,I thought you had to finish your mission report.
01:50:51.478,01:50:52.521,I do.
01:50:52.896,01:50:56.108,But I thought it would be more pleasing to engage with you socially.
01:50:58.235,01:50:59.444,You old romantic.
01:51:07.953,01:51:12.624,Do you know that scotch was actually invented by a little old lady in Russia?
01:51:17.337,01:51:20.591,"Uh, did you drink all those yourself? I'm impressed."
01:51:21.008,01:51:23.093,Someone said it will take my edge off.
01:51:23.552,01:51:25.554,My edge is still not off.
01:51:25.679,01:51:27.639,"Aye, well, maybe this will help."
01:51:29.099,01:51:30.767,Captain pulled a few strings.
01:51:31.226,01:51:34.396,"That is acceptance into Starfleet Academy, if you want it."
01:51:34.980,01:51:37.524,They have a lot of rules. Don't listen to them all.
01:51:38.025,01:51:39.985,Will I have to wear that uniform?
01:51:45.032,01:51:45.949,"Hey, Keenser."
01:51:46.558,01:51:49.059,"Kevin. Still not wearing pants, I see."
01:51:55.542,01:51:57.377,I heard about Ambassador Spock.
01:51:59.463,01:52:02.591,Is that what you wanted to mention that time in the turbolift?
01:52:05.802,01:52:07.012,More or less.
01:52:09.431,01:52:12.100,I trust your meeting with Commodore Paris went well.
01:52:15.854,01:52:16.980,More or less.
01:52:25.072,01:52:27.157,"You really want to head back out there, huh?"
00:21:15.107,00:21:16.650,"All clear, Krall."
00:22:16.752,00:22:19.296,I have the Abronath.
00:22:19.880,00:22:21.507,Secure the ship.
00:24:44.984,00:24:47.319,"Krall, the ship is turning back!"
00:24:49.113,00:24:50.614,Cut its throat.
00:35:25.624,00:35:27.584,We're searching for the captain.
01:05:27.632,01:05:29.467,We searched the wreckage.
01:05:29.717,01:05:31.719,He must have hidden it elsewhere.
01:05:35.306,01:05:38.977,"All we have is his crew, Krall."
01:15:54.508,01:15:55.801,Let me deal with them.
01:15:56.260,01:15:57.470,You've brought us this far.
01:15:58.345,01:16:00.347,"Finish the mission, Krall."
01:18:27.369,01:18:29.163,You will die here...
01:18:29.622,01:18:31.665,Just like your father.
01:20:16.645,01:20:19.565,They will leave you here.
