00:01:32.425,00:01:34.594,were in Colorforms City Park.
00:01:35.345,00:01:38.681,We need some more characters for our story.
00:01:38.765,00:01:41.226,"Hey, hey, Violet and Red!"

00:01:47.482,00:01:49.484,You never know what you might need on an adventure.
00:01:50.151,00:01:58.243,We're on an adventure to find out what's at the other end of the Colorforms City Rainbow.
00:02:02.247,00:02:05.208,What are we going to find there? A rainbow monster?
00:02:06.751,00:02:09.420,Or a rainbow monster?
00:02:10.380,00:02:12.757,"Or a really, really tall banana."
00:02:13.174,00:02:14.634,I don't like tall bananas.
00:02:14.717,00:02:16.469,I don't know.
00:02:17.846,00:02:21.141,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:02:21.224,00:02:24.561,We adventurers are going to find out...
00:02:26.020,00:02:27.021,together!
00:02:29.691,00:02:31.192,Stick with us.
00:02:31.276,00:02:33.111,Vio-let's get going!
00:02:36.906,00:02:37.740,It's dark.
00:02:38.575,00:02:39.742,No. I'm good.
00:02:41.327,00:02:43.872,Let's follow the rainbow...
00:02:44.247,00:02:48.585,to the other end of the rainbow!
00:02:50.628,00:02:53.089,Violet is the scout on this adventure.
00:02:53.548,00:02:58.052,I run up ahead and tell you what's coming up!
00:02:59.888,00:03:02.849,We adventurers need to be ready for anything!
00:03:03.141,00:03:03.975,Anything?
00:03:04.809,00:03:06.311,I hope I brought enough stuff.
00:03:07.061,00:03:09.272,"Really, really tall bananas!"
00:03:09.355,00:03:10.857,Violet the Scout reporting!
00:03:11.232,00:03:15.486,"There's a forest up ahead with some really, really tall bananas."
00:03:15.570,00:03:17.071,We can see that!
00:03:18.740,00:03:19.908,Right.
00:03:19.991,00:03:20.992,There they are.
00:03:21.951,00:03:25.538,Why does the rainbow have to go over a forest full of giant fruit?
00:03:26.122,00:03:28.541,Maybe I'll just stick around here.
00:03:29.292,00:03:30.293,Yuh-oh!
00:03:30.376,00:03:35.381,"Red doesn't want to keep adventuring, because he's worried about the tall bananas."
00:03:35.465,00:03:41.012,"But if we don't keep going, how will we ever know what's at the other end of the rainbow?"
00:03:43.181,00:03:45.850,Our story is getting sticky.
00:03:45.934,00:03:47.810,What do you think we should do?
00:03:51.231,00:03:56.069,"What if we come up with an adventure chant, to help Red feel brave?"
00:03:56.152,00:03:58.905,Then Red won't think about the bananas!
00:03:59.489,00:04:02.825,"Red, repeat after me. Red-dy?"
00:04:02.909,00:04:04.077,Red-dy.
00:04:04.410,00:04:07.205,"When I say adventure, you say..."
00:04:07.497,00:04:09.040,Adventure.
00:04:10.458,00:04:12.543,-Adventure! -Adventure.
00:04:12.627,00:04:14.754,Adventure!
00:04:15.129,00:04:17.340,-Adventure! -Adventure!
00:04:17.423,00:04:19.801,Adventure!
00:04:23.346,00:04:26.099,"-You did it, Red! -Fantastic!"
00:04:26.849,00:04:28.059,I did it!
00:04:28.351,00:04:29.811,"Take that, bananas."
00:04:29.894,00:04:32.063,You're not so big after all.
00:04:34.357,00:04:35.441,Hold on.
00:04:36.484,00:04:37.568,All right!
00:04:41.030,00:04:44.534,This rainbow is taking us to some strange places.
00:04:46.202,00:04:47.453,"Thanks, adventurers."
00:04:48.913,00:04:51.165,I wonder what we'll see next.
00:04:51.457,00:04:53.376,Rainbow monster?
00:04:53.751,00:04:55.670,To the other end of the rainbow!
00:05:08.433,00:05:09.267,Help!
00:05:10.268,00:05:11.477,-Violet! -Violet!
00:05:17.442,00:05:18.818,Giggle bushes!
00:05:19.027,00:05:22.405,I was trying to scout ahead.
00:05:24.449,00:05:26.993,"I just ran right in, and now I'm..."
00:05:27.869,00:05:29.871,too giggly to get out!
00:05:29.954,00:05:31.372,"I'll help you, Violet!"
00:05:32.040,00:05:35.752,I just need a broom and a Viking helmet.
00:05:35.835,00:05:39.172,And... stick! It's a Violet-getter!
00:05:39.839,00:05:42.508,"Violet, grab on to the horns!"
00:05:43.051,00:05:45.720,"When I say adventure, you say..."
00:05:45.803,00:05:47.013,-Adventure! -Adventure!
00:05:53.311,00:05:54.771,"Thanks, adventurers."
00:05:55.063,00:05:58.066,"These giggle bushes, they're everywhere."
00:05:58.149,00:06:01.861,"If we keep following the rainbow, we'll all get stuck giggling."
00:06:02.820,00:06:08.201,"But if we don't keep following the rainbow, we'll never see what's at the other end!"
00:06:11.662,00:06:14.248,Our story is getting stickier.
00:06:14.332,00:06:16.501,"What should we do next, storytellers?"
00:06:16.876,00:06:18.711,How can we keep adventuring?
00:06:21.255,00:06:23.257,Idea break!
00:06:24.133,00:06:30.973,"How about we surf across the bushes on one of those really, really tall bananas?"
00:06:31.057,00:06:31.891,Nope.
00:06:32.558,00:06:35.478,What if we go under? In a tunnel?
00:06:35.561,00:06:39.982,"We could use a shovel, or a spoon, or a spoon shovel."
00:06:41.150,00:06:43.528,That would take a long time.
00:06:44.320,00:06:46.614,"Hey, what if we go over?"
00:06:47.073,00:06:52.078,We can make a bridge that goes right over the giggle bush patch!
00:06:52.703,00:06:54.747,Will you make a bridge with me?
00:06:57.083,00:07:01.295,Let's shake it up!
00:07:09.387,00:07:10.513,Okay.
00:07:10.847,00:07:15.059,First we need some strong posts to hold up the bridge.
00:07:15.143,00:07:18.896,"Rectangle here, rectangle here."
00:07:19.439,00:07:22.483,"Now, let's create the part we'll walk on."
00:07:22.733,00:07:24.944,How about blue diamond...
00:07:26.028,00:07:31.826,"green triangle, red circle, orange square?"
00:07:33.327,00:07:37.874,"And then another blue diamond, green triangle."
00:07:39.041,00:07:40.960,"Hey, it's a pattern!"
00:07:41.043,00:07:42.753,I love patterns!
00:07:43.087,00:07:44.255,Let's keep going!
00:07:44.881,00:07:46.549,What shape comes next?
00:07:49.927,00:07:52.889,The red circle! Yipperoo!
00:07:52.972,00:07:55.141,And now what shape should we use?
00:07:56.184,00:07:58.686,The orange square.
00:07:59.437,00:08:04.275,"And then the blue diamond, green triangle, red circle, orange square."
00:08:04.358,00:08:06.527,And what shape comes next?
00:08:07.737,00:08:09.197,Blue diamond!
00:08:09.280,00:08:13.951,"Green triangle, red circle, orange square! We've almost finished the bridge."
00:08:14.035,00:08:16.996,"Blue diamond, green triangle, red circle, orange square."
00:08:17.079,00:08:19.415,"Blue diamond, green triangle, red circle."
00:08:19.499,00:08:22.919,And now what shape should we use to finish it off?
00:08:25.796,00:08:28.883,The orange square.
00:08:28.966,00:08:31.844,"And... drum roll, please."
00:08:32.428,00:08:36.641,Boo-da-doo!
00:08:37.183,00:08:39.936,Let's get back to our adventure story.
00:08:40.937,00:08:42.688,We've got our bridge!
00:08:43.773,00:08:44.774,Yeah!
00:08:44.857,00:08:46.817,To the other end of the rainbow!
00:08:46.901,00:08:48.736,"Brilliant, Charlie!"
00:08:49.904,00:08:53.533,"-When I say adventure, you say... -Adventure!"
00:08:53.616,00:08:56.536,Adventure! Adventure!
00:08:56.619,00:08:58.371,Violet the Scout reporting!
00:08:58.454,00:09:02.166,"I followed the rainbow, and it goes right to..."
00:09:03.000,00:09:04.502,"a deep, dark tunnel."
00:09:04.585,00:09:05.878,What?
00:09:05.962,00:09:07.797,"I don't like deep, dark tunnels."
00:09:12.093,00:09:14.220,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:16.264,00:09:19.225,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:09:19.308,00:09:21.602,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:21.852,00:09:25.690,"-When I say adventure, you say... -Adventure!"
00:09:28.693,00:09:29.527,I'm good!

00:10:04.645,00:10:06.480,What are we going to see?
00:10:07.148,00:10:09.025,So close! Yay!
00:10:10.401,00:10:11.819,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:10:12.236,00:10:13.613,We made it!
00:10:14.905,00:10:19.619,"It's not a rainbow monster, but it is one monster rainbow."
00:10:19.702,00:10:20.870,Brilliant.
00:10:32.798,00:10:34.508,Cowa-banana!
00:10:36.677,00:10:38.888,Cannonball!

00:10:43.434,00:10:44.644,Incoming!
00:10:51.192,00:10:55.863,"We adventurers made it to the other end of the rainbow, together."
00:10:57.073,00:10:58.199,The end.
00:10:59.450,00:11:00.534,Or is it?
00:11:02.536,00:11:05.665,What if we keep adventuring beyond the rainbow?
00:11:05.748,00:11:07.958,What do you think we would find next?
00:11:10.211,00:11:13.339,You've got a story to create!
00:11:18.094,00:11:19.845,Whoa-a-doh-doh!

00:14:40.546,00:14:46.886,What if we create one pet that has all the cuddle-wuddle cute things that these pets have?
00:14:48.220,00:14:51.223,Will you create a brand-new cuddly pet with me?
00:14:53.809,00:14:55.853,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:14:56.437,00:15:00.482,Let's shake it up!
00:15:08.324,00:15:10.618,We can start with a circle for a head...
00:15:11.410,00:15:12.494,like a puppy!
00:15:13.871,00:15:16.916,What shape could we use for a body like a turtle?
00:15:21.003,00:15:23.422,Let's use this semicircle for the body.
00:15:25.799,00:15:32.222,"And now we need little piggy legs for prancing, or dancing, or wiggly-jiggling!"
00:15:33.474,00:15:35.684,Which shapes look like legs to you?
00:15:39.521,00:15:41.357,Let's try these squares!
00:15:44.401,00:15:45.235,And...
00:15:46.320,00:15:48.822,what about wings like a bird?
00:15:48.906,00:15:50.866,Which shapes should we use?
00:15:54.912,00:15:55.746,Yes!
00:15:55.829,00:15:59.959,"Semicircle wings, and a kitty-cat tail."
00:16:00.334,00:16:01.835,"Drum roll, please."
00:16:01.919,00:16:06.131,Boo-da-doo!
00:16:08.008,00:16:10.844,One cutie-tootie pet-a-roonie!
00:16:11.887,00:16:14.014,Let's take you back to our story!
00:16:23.107,00:16:24.900,He is so cute!
00:16:25.275,00:16:27.569,And his name is...
00:16:29.196,00:16:30.280,Klunk!
00:16:30.531,00:16:32.908,-What? -Klunk! Klunk!
00:16:33.242,00:16:34.785,I think his name is...
00:16:34.868,00:16:35.869,Klunk!
00:16:37.037,00:16:38.872,Klunk! Klunk! Klunk!
00:16:41.750,00:16:44.336,"Octo-bocto, meet Klunk!"
00:16:44.420,00:16:46.296,"Hey, hey, Klunk!"
00:16:46.380,00:16:49.633,"Looks like you got just the pet you wanted, Charlie."
00:16:50.884,00:16:52.803,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:16:53.512,00:16:55.055,"Thanks, Octo-bocto!"
00:16:55.139,00:16:56.640,"Bye-bye, pets!"
00:16:57.433,00:17:00.269,"We're going to have so much fun, little Klunk."
00:17:05.274,00:17:06.650,Do you see Klunk?
00:17:10.863,00:17:12.865,"Klunk, I found you!"
00:17:22.875,00:17:24.626,Klunk-a-dunk!
00:17:24.918,00:17:25.753,Yeah!
00:17:27.713,00:17:30.549,"Hey, hey, come back here!"
00:17:34.219,00:17:37.097,"Oh, look, Klunk! It's Violet and Red!"
00:17:37.181,00:17:38.348,"Hey, hey!"
00:17:38.432,00:17:39.975,"Hey, hey, Charlie!"
00:17:40.059,00:17:41.435,What's a Klunk?
00:17:43.771,00:17:45.564,This is Klunk! My new pet!
00:17:50.027,00:17:50.944,Hello!
00:17:51.111,00:17:52.362,I think he likes me.
00:17:55.783,00:17:57.534,"That tickles, Klunk."
00:17:59.286,00:18:00.329,What is it?
00:18:00.412,00:18:01.914,"What do you want, Klunk?"
00:18:04.083,00:18:06.251,He really wants something.
00:18:07.753,00:18:09.463,"What does he want, Charlie?"
00:18:09.713,00:18:11.090,I don't know.
00:18:11.173,00:18:12.508,Colour me green.
00:18:12.591,00:18:13.717,I'm worried.
00:18:16.428,00:18:18.472,I don't know what Klunk wants!
00:18:21.391,00:18:24.019,Our story is getting stickier.
00:18:24.311,00:18:26.146,What do you think he wants?
00:18:28.899,00:18:30.192,"Are you hungry, Klunk?"
00:18:30.484,00:18:31.944,We've got lots of food.
00:18:32.027,00:18:36.532,"Vegetables, fruits, meats, little pickles."
00:18:37.825,00:18:39.535,Try the little pickle.
00:18:41.453,00:18:43.622,I think he's going to...
00:18:47.876,00:18:51.380,"-Okay, not hungry. -He's not hungry?"
00:18:53.048,00:18:54.383,Or nap?
00:18:54.466,00:18:55.801,He could be like...
00:19:03.100,00:19:06.478,"Go to sleep, you little..."
00:19:07.604,00:19:09.439,That didn't work either.
00:19:10.190,00:19:13.277,I've got it. Best idea ever.
00:19:13.360,00:19:15.070,A dance party!
00:19:15.154,00:19:16.947,-Yeh-hess! -Brilliant!
00:19:17.030,00:19:18.949,All pets need exercise.
00:19:19.032,00:19:20.909,One and a-two and a-one...
00:19:20.993,00:19:24.413,"Okay, a little sticky magic and..."
00:19:24.496,00:19:27.291,It's boogie-time!
00:19:27.374,00:19:35.632,-Yeah! -And one and a-two and a-three and a-four and a-five and a-six and a-seven and eight and a...
00:19:37.676,00:19:40.012,None of these ideas are working.
00:19:40.679,00:19:42.639,But we can't give up!
00:19:44.433,00:19:45.726,Brushing your tail?
00:19:51.023,00:19:53.775,-A hot-air balloon ride? -Yeh-hess!
00:20:04.203,00:20:05.829,An underwater adventure?
00:20:16.089,00:20:17.716,A trip to outer space?
00:20:26.475,00:20:27.976,That was exhausting!
00:20:28.268,00:20:30.520,We've tried everything.
00:20:33.607,00:20:36.276,Colour me blue. I'm sad.
00:20:38.111,00:20:40.530,I can't figure out what Klunk wants.
00:20:41.406,00:20:43.492,Is this how our story ends?
00:20:51.250,00:20:52.084,Hey!
00:20:52.417,00:20:53.919,Klunk is happy again!
00:20:54.378,00:20:55.212,What?
00:20:55.796,00:20:59.508,"Klunk, did you just want a...? A hug?"
00:21:01.635,00:21:02.552,You did?
00:21:03.095,00:21:06.765,I tried everything... except a hug!
00:21:12.938,00:21:15.524,Let's make this story even better!
00:21:16.108,00:21:19.027,An even bigger squeezy hug!
00:21:32.624,00:21:34.626,Colour me happy!
00:21:37.254,00:21:38.922,Look at his tail!
00:21:39.589,00:21:41.717,It's all rainbow-y!
00:21:42.926,00:21:44.928,I think that means he's happy.
00:21:45.595,00:21:46.888,Just like me.
00:21:47.806,00:21:48.890,Klunk.
00:22:04.281,00:22:05.532,The end.
00:22:07.701,00:22:08.910,Or is it?
00:22:09.661,00:22:11.621,-Not again! -Okay!
00:22:11.747,00:22:13.165,"Hop-hop, wait up!"
00:22:14.583,00:22:17.461,What if we helped the Silly Faces catch that frog?
00:22:17.794,00:22:19.755,What do you think would happen next?
00:22:26.386,00:22:29.181,You've got a story to create!
00:22:47.115,00:22:48.784,Hot sand. Yikes!
00:23:03.090,00:23:05.217,Hey! That tickles!
00:23:07.636,00:23:09.179,"Come in, storyteller."
00:23:09.888,00:23:11.306,See you next time.
00:23:11.807,00:23:13.892,Over and out!
00:23:17.437,00:00:12.345,Subtitles translated by: Whoa!
00:00:17.767,00:00:19.185,Hello!
00:00:19.269,00:00:21.146,Whoo-hoo!
00:00:23.481,00:00:26.151,They're off on another big adventure.
00:00:27.360,00:00:29.571,Ooh! I wish we could go with them.
00:00:30.947,00:00:36.453,"Hey, what if we create our own big adventure in a story?"
00:00:39.414,00:00:42.208,Will you create an adventure story with me?
00:00:44.377,00:00:46.087,All right!
00:00:46.546,00:00:51.551,I feel a story coming on!
00:00:53.094,00:00:54.721,Let's get this story started.
00:01:10.570,00:01:12.405,Here's something That you're not gonna wanna miss.
00:01:12.489,00:01:14.074,Let's give that plot a twist!
00:01:23.458,00:01:25.418,Let’s start our adventure story.
00:01:26.711,00:01:28.463,Once upon a time...
00:01:29.255,00:01:31.424,you and I...
00:01:32.509,00:01:34.552,were in Colorforms City Park.
00:02:10.213,00:02:13.007,"Or a really, really tall banana?"
00:02:14.801,00:02:16.845,I don't know.
00:02:21.224,00:02:24.978,We adventurers are going to find out...
00:02:31.401,00:02:33.444,Vio-let's get going!
00:02:36.322,00:02:38.491,"Uh, it's dark. Ugh!"
00:02:38.575,00:02:39.951,Nope. I'm good.
00:02:40.034,00:02:41.035,Whew!
00:02:50.628,00:02:53.464,Violet is the scout on this adventure.
00:02:53.548,00:02:57.385,I run up ahead and tell you what's coming up!
00:02:59.888,00:03:03.057,We adventurers need to be ready for anything!
00:03:35.465,00:03:41.387,"But if we don't keep going, how will we ever know what's at the other end of the rainbow?"
00:03:43.181,00:03:47.977,Our story is getting sticky. What do you think we should do?
00:03:56.152,00:03:59.030,Then Red won't think about the bananas!
00:03:59.489,00:04:04.327,"-Red, repeat after me. Red-y? -Ready."
00:04:32.146,00:04:34.274,Whoa! Ooh!
00:04:51.457,00:04:53.668,Rainbow monster?
00:05:23.698,00:05:27.577,"I just ran right in, and now I'm..."
00:05:29.954,00:05:31.873,"I'll help you, Violet!"
00:05:39.756,00:05:42.717,"Violet, grab onto the horns!"
00:06:05.782,00:06:08.576,we'll never see what's at the other end!
00:06:11.662,00:06:16.793,"Our story is getting stickier. What should we do next, storytellers?"
00:06:16.876,00:06:19.128,How can we keep adventuring?
00:06:44.320,00:06:46.989,"Hey, what if we go over?"
00:06:57.083,00:07:01.671,Let's sha-aa-ke it up!
00:07:15.143,00:07:19.230,"Rectangle here, rectangle here."
00:07:19.439,00:07:22.650,"Now, let's create the part we'll walk on."
00:07:44.881,00:07:47.008,What shape comes next?
00:07:52.972,00:07:55.516,And now what shape should we use?
00:07:56.184,00:07:59.020,The orange square.
00:08:04.358,00:08:06.944,And what shape comes next?
00:08:14.035,00:08:16.829,"Blue diamond, green triangle, red circle, orange square."
00:08:19.499,00:08:23.252,And now what shape should we use to finish it off?
00:08:28.966,00:08:32.345,"And... drum roll, please."
00:08:32.428,00:08:36.307,Ooh-da-doo!
00:08:46.901,00:08:49.111,"Brilliant, Charlie!"
00:09:12.093,00:09:14.512,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:21.852,00:09:25.898,"-When I say adventure, you say... -Adventure!"
00:09:54.343,00:09:56.178,Ooh!
00:10:38.971,00:10:41.557,"Wait for me! I'm coming for you, banana!"
00:10:51.192,00:10:56.238,We adventurers made it to the other end of the rainbow together.
00:10:57.073,00:10:58.699,The end.
00:10:59.450,00:11:01.202,Or is it?
00:11:05.748,00:11:08.334,What do you think we would find next?
00:11:34.527,00:11:36.946,I'm pretending to be a puppy!
00:11:57.508,00:11:59.051,In a story!
00:12:32.001,00:12:33.836,Here's something That you're not gonna wanna miss.
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.558,Let's get this story started.
00:12:48.476,00:12:50.311,Once upon a time...
00:12:51.228,00:12:53.189,you and I...
00:12:54.356,00:12:59.320,"were at the Colorforms City Pet Farm, where all kinds of pets live!"
00:13:43.322,00:13:47.618,"Hello, you fuzzy puppy! And hi there, you tough, tough turtle!"
00:14:19.233,00:14:21.026,What would you do?
00:14:22.903,00:14:27.408,"Well, you could try and take care of all of the pets."
00:14:34.874,00:14:36.000,Or...
00:14:36.542,00:14:40.588,let's get creative and make this story even better!
00:14:40.671,00:14:47.261,What if we create one pet that has all the cuddle-wuddle cute things these pets have?
00:14:56.228,00:15:00.733,Let's sha-aa-ke it up!
00:15:08.157,00:15:12.786,"We can start with a circle for a head, like a puppy!"
00:15:13.871,00:15:17.333,What shape could we use for a body like a turtle?
00:15:21.003,00:15:23.797,Let's use this semi-circle for the body.
00:15:25.883,00:15:32.556,"And now, we need little piggy legs for prancing or dancing or wiggly-jiggling!"
00:15:33.474,00:15:35.976,Which shapes look like legs to you?
00:15:39.521,00:15:41.774,Let's try these squares!
00:15:49.031,00:15:51.241,Which shapes should we use?
00:15:55.829,00:16:00.250,Semi-circle wings and a kitty-cat tail.
00:16:21.563,00:16:25.234,Oh! He's so cute!
00:16:30.531,00:16:33.158,-What? -Klunk! Klunk!
00:16:46.380,00:16:49.883,"Looks like you got just the pet you wanted, Charlie."
00:16:53.512,00:16:56.849,"Thanks, Octo-Bocto! Bye-bye, pets!"
00:16:57.433,00:17:00.394,"We're going to have so much fun, little Klunk."
00:17:05.274,00:17:07.151,Do you see Klunk?
00:17:52.237,00:17:53.363,"Klunk, klunk, klunk, klunk!"
00:17:55.783,00:17:57.826,"That tickles, Klunk."
00:18:00.412,00:18:03.832,"-What do you want, Klunk? -Klunk! Klunk, klunk, klunk, klunk!"
00:18:04.083,00:18:05.959,He really wants something.
00:18:06.043,00:18:07.669,"Klunk, klunk, klunk, klunk!"
00:18:13.801,00:18:15.636,"Klunk, klunk, klunk...?"
00:18:16.428,00:18:18.722,I don't know what Klunk wants!
00:18:21.141,00:18:26.480,Our story is getting stickier! What do you think he wants?
00:18:46.542,00:18:47.793,"Klunk, klunk, klunk, klunk!"
00:19:01.932,00:19:03.016,Shh!
00:19:06.562,00:19:09.857,"-Klunk, klunk, klunk-klunk! -That didn't work, either."
00:19:33.005,00:19:36.216,"-Klunk, klunk, klunk. -And seven and eight and..."
00:19:37.759,00:19:40.345,None of these ideas are working.
00:19:40.679,00:19:42.890,But we can't give up!
00:19:44.474,00:19:46.059,Brushing your tail?
00:20:04.203,00:20:06.205,An underwater adventure?

00:02:59.179,00:03:00.388,What should we do?
00:03:00.972,00:03:03.183,Bounce in your bouncy room!
00:03:03.266,00:03:05.518,And have a tea party.
00:03:06.352,00:03:07.854,And also brush our teeth.
00:03:07.937,00:03:08.980,I...
00:03:09.439,00:03:10.982,have a new toothbrush.

00:03:17.614,00:03:20.575,And we're going to start with-- Weather report!

00:03:22.744,00:03:23.745,What's up?
00:03:23.828,00:03:26.039,"The sun's up, that's what!"
00:03:26.122,00:03:30.001,But it's almost time to pull it down and make it night.
00:03:30.084,00:03:31.794,Good almost-night!
00:03:31.878,00:03:32.795,Bye!

00:03:44.849,00:03:46.434,Colour me green.
00:03:46.517,00:03:47.769,I'm worried.
00:03:47.852,00:03:51.314,I don't know if we have enough time to do everything we want to do.
00:03:53.483,00:03:55.944,Our story is getting sticky.
00:03:56.527,00:03:58.863,How can we do everything before bedtime?
00:03:58.947,00:03:59.948,I know.
00:04:00.240,00:04:01.658,We need a clock.
00:04:01.741,00:04:03.785,To make sure we can do everything.
00:04:03.868,00:04:05.078,Yeh-hess!
00:04:05.161,00:04:09.791,"A clock can tell us what to do next, and show us when it's bedtime."
00:04:10.124,00:04:11.542,Brilliant!
00:04:11.626,00:04:13.711,Should we make a clock?
00:04:15.129,00:04:19.175,Let's shake it up!
00:04:25.682,00:04:26.516,Okay.
00:04:27.433,00:04:30.228,What shape can we use for the clock's face?
00:04:32.355,00:04:35.275,How about this circle?
00:04:37.068,00:04:39.946,And we need something so the clock can point.
00:04:40.405,00:04:41.781,What can we use?
00:04:43.783,00:04:45.785,This triangle's a perfect point.
00:04:47.870,00:04:50.623,And now we need bells...
00:04:51.874,00:04:54.210,so the clock can ring.
00:04:54.877,00:04:56.546,What shape can we use?
00:04:59.674,00:05:02.385,These semicircles can be the clock's bells.
00:05:05.388,00:05:08.433,Now... we need everything we are going to do.
00:05:08.766,00:05:10.268,Bouncy room...
00:05:12.186,00:05:13.438,tea party...
00:05:14.772,00:05:17.734,"brush teeth, and sleep."
00:05:19.610,00:05:21.446,"Drum roll, please."
00:05:21.654,00:05:25.783,Boo-da-doo!
00:05:28.995,00:05:30.038,Fantastic!
00:05:30.121,00:05:31.706,Let's go show our friends.
00:05:33.750,00:05:37.295,"Introducing our new clock friend, Ringo."
00:05:39.047,00:05:41.966,Yes! This sleepover is happening!
00:05:42.050,00:05:43.801,Vio-let's get going!
00:05:43.885,00:05:46.637,So we have enough time to brush our teeth!
00:05:46.721,00:05:49.265,"Okay, Ringo, what time is it?"
00:05:53.770,00:05:56.647,It's bouncy-room time!
00:05:56.731,00:05:57.982,Stick with us.
00:05:59.275,00:06:01.361,Bounce! Bounce!

00:06:04.364,00:06:05.198,Yes!
00:06:05.615,00:06:06.824,Big bounce!
00:06:11.496,00:06:13.498,Look! Ringo's about to ring!
00:06:16.626,00:06:18.252,Tea-party time!
00:06:22.006,00:06:23.966,Could you please pass the tea?
00:06:24.717,00:06:27.220,We're doing everything before sleep!
00:06:28.554,00:06:31.557,This cannot be any more fun.
00:06:31.933,00:06:32.767,"Oh, yeah?"
00:06:32.850,00:06:35.436,Let's make this story even better.
00:06:36.312,00:06:40.733,How about we turn this tea party upside down?
00:06:42.985,00:06:45.655,Can you please pass the tea... upside down?
00:06:47.490,00:06:48.825,Ringo's about to ring!
00:06:52.453,00:06:53.913,Brushing teeth!
00:06:54.330,00:06:55.665,Yeh-hess!
00:06:55.748,00:06:57.375,My favourite time!
00:07:09.637,00:07:10.972,Moon is up!
00:07:12.306,00:07:15.184,I repeat: moon is up!
00:07:15.268,00:07:17.395,It's bedtime!
00:07:19.439,00:07:21.315,Good real-night.
00:07:27.238,00:07:28.156,Bedtime!
00:07:28.239,00:07:30.867,We did everything we wanted to do.
00:07:30.950,00:07:31.951,And now...
00:07:32.702,00:07:36.372,I'm going to sleep so hard.
00:07:37.373,00:07:39.083,"Yes, please."
00:07:43.045,00:07:43.963,Good night.
00:07:48.885,00:07:49.927,Good night.
00:07:50.011,00:07:51.929,And good night to you.
00:07:56.726,00:07:57.852,Wha..? Wha...? Wha...?
00:08:01.689,00:08:04.817,Silly Ringo. We're done playing.
00:08:05.151,00:08:08.279,It's time for sleeping at the sleepover.
00:08:16.496,00:08:18.206,What's wrong with Ringo?
00:08:18.289,00:08:20.791,Yuh-oh. I-- I don't know!
00:08:23.753,00:08:24.962,I got it.
00:08:26.130,00:08:27.632,"-No, I don't. -Hey!"
00:08:28.382,00:08:29.759,"Oh, sorry!"
00:08:32.637,00:08:35.556,No one is going to sleep with Ringo running around.
00:08:39.560,00:08:42.396,Our story is getting stickier.
00:08:47.652,00:08:49.737,We need to stop that clock!
00:08:50.404,00:08:52.990,"-Come back here, Ringo! -No, I think he went this way!"
00:08:53.616,00:08:55.034,-Come on! -Let's go!
00:08:56.369,00:08:58.037,Come on! Get back here!
00:08:58.120,00:08:59.580,I'm gonna get you!
00:08:59.914,00:09:02.625,"Oh, no! Ringo's going into the bouncy room!"
00:09:02.708,00:09:04.001,Stick with us.
00:09:12.510,00:09:13.844,Is it morning?
00:09:14.178,00:09:16.264,Guess I'll put the sun back up.
00:09:16.347,00:09:18.599,It's not daytime yet!
00:09:18.683,00:09:20.351,It's still nighttime!
00:09:20.434,00:09:24.564,"We're trying to get to sleep, and Ringo won't stop ringing."
00:09:29.068,00:09:31.862,Is this how our sleepover story ends?
00:09:37.660,00:09:40.037,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:40.621,00:09:41.956,But what?
00:09:46.586,00:09:48.838,Did Ringo just yawn?
00:09:49.630,00:09:51.549,Plot twist!
00:09:51.632,00:09:53.134,Ringo is tired.
00:09:53.217,00:09:55.428,Ringo needs to go to sleep.
00:09:56.887,00:10:00.349,"Quick! Let's make Ringo a bed, to sleep in."
00:10:05.813,00:10:07.315,Find some pillows.
00:10:08.316,00:10:09.650,Here they are.
00:10:09.734,00:10:13.154,And my teddy bear night light's backup night light.
00:10:13.237,00:10:14.322,And...
00:10:15.406,00:10:18.284,a little cute teddy bear Ringo for cuddling.
00:10:18.576,00:10:19.952,Cu-yute.
00:10:20.786,00:10:22.204,"Here, Ringo!"

00:10:35.343,00:10:37.303,So sleepy.
00:10:48.439,00:10:49.899,It's working!
00:10:54.612,00:10:55.738,The end.
00:10:56.030,00:10:57.031,Or is it?
00:10:57.281,00:11:01.077,"If Ringo's sleeping, who's gonna wake us up in the morning?"
00:11:01.160,00:11:02.453,A silly rooster?
00:11:04.747,00:11:07.083,What do you think will happen next?
00:11:10.211,00:11:13.005,You've got a story to create!

00:14:32.538,00:14:35.332,Our story is getting sticky.
00:14:35.583,00:14:37.710,"I love scooting too, Harley."
00:14:38.043,00:14:40.004,"What should we do next, storyteller?"
00:14:43.883,00:14:45.843,Let's make a scooter!
00:14:45.926,00:14:50.723,Or a double-scooter that Harley and I can ride together!

00:18:29.608,00:18:32.444,I thought brothers always liked the same things.
00:18:34.696,00:18:37.116,Our story is getting stickier.
00:18:37.199,00:18:39.326,"What should we do next, storyteller?"
00:18:43.413,00:18:48.127,Maybe we can sing and play with shapes at the same time!
00:18:48.710,00:18:51.755,"Harley, can you find me a circle?"
00:18:52.089,00:18:53.257,Circle!

00:22:06.700,00:22:07.993,The end.
00:22:09.202,00:22:12.664,What if we create a story about...

00:11:46.539,00:11:49.250,I've always wanted a little brother.
00:11:50.042,00:11:52.211,What would you do with a little brother?
00:11:56.090,00:11:59.802,Hey! Do you know where I could have a little brother?
00:12:02.304,00:12:07.226,My brother and I would play all our favorite things all day long.

00:18:48.710,00:18:52.005,"Harley, can you find me a circle?"

00:04:11.668,00:04:13.378,We can't complete our mission!
00:04:13.461,00:04:19.717,Yuh-oh! We need to get these cat asteroids out of the way so we can keep following the Silly Faces.
00:04:20.927,00:04:23.304,Our story is getting sticky.
00:04:26.516,00:04:28.685,What can we use to move these cats?
00:04:28.768,00:04:31.145,Sunglasses? A flower?
00:04:31.229,00:04:32.605,A ball of yarn?
00:04:34.315,00:04:35.566,A ball of yarn.
00:04:36.401,00:04:38.945,If we get the cats to chase the yarn away...
00:04:39.028,00:04:42.699,Then we can get through and find the Silly Faces!

00:05:15.106,00:05:17.692,Let's find those Silly Faces.
00:05:17.775,00:05:20.987,And follow them to the Red Planet.
00:05:21.070,00:05:24.574,Somewhere we've never been before.
00:05:25.867,00:05:27.618,The Silly Faces!
00:05:27.702,00:05:30.538,There they go! And there's the Red Planet!
00:05:30.621,00:05:34.167,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:05:34.250,00:05:40.840,Let's be extra-careful and go nice and slow...
00:05:40.923,00:05:47.930,Or let's see the planet right now and go... as fast as we can!
00:05:48.014,00:05:50.516,Nice and slow!
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.310,As fast as we can!
00:05:55.480,00:05:56.314,Yuh-oh!
00:06:06.866,00:06:08.659,Red alert! Red alert!
00:06:09.494,00:06:12.997,"Prepare for a bumpy landing, space explorers."
00:06:25.426,00:06:26.302,Phew.
00:06:27.220,00:06:29.013,Is everyone okay?
00:06:29.305,00:06:32.350,Space is upside down now.
00:06:35.269,00:06:36.187,I'm good.
00:06:37.230,00:06:40.066,Then let's go find those Silly Faces!
00:06:42.443,00:06:43.403,Yuh-oh!
00:06:43.820,00:06:45.321,The door won't unlock!
00:06:45.405,00:06:47.490,The buttons broke from the landing!
00:06:48.116,00:06:49.492,Colour me green.
00:06:50.076,00:06:51.577,I'm worried.
00:06:51.828,00:06:53.538,There has to be a way.
00:06:59.419,00:07:03.172,We can't get to where we've never been before if we can't open the door.
00:07:07.343,00:07:09.303,Our story is getting stickier.
00:07:10.430,00:07:12.557,What do you think we should do next?
00:07:15.351,00:07:17.520,We have to fix the buttons.
00:07:18.354,00:07:22.525,Let's shake it up!
00:07:31.909,00:07:34.370,"Okay, circle button first."
00:07:36.789,00:07:39.333,Yuh-oh! We don't have a circle!
00:07:39.876,00:07:41.919,What shapes can we use?
00:07:50.470,00:07:51.721,Is this right?
00:07:54.015,00:07:55.057,Nope.
00:07:55.224,00:08:00.146,"Let me just turn it around, and yes, yes, yes, yes!"
00:08:00.938,00:08:03.483,Now the square button.
00:08:04.442,00:08:06.277,No squares.
00:08:06.360,00:08:09.155,"So, what shapes can we use?"
00:08:11.240,00:08:14.035,Let's try these... rectangles!
00:08:15.620,00:08:17.288,There! A square.
00:08:18.664,00:08:20.833,"And finally, the trapezium button."
00:08:20.917,00:08:22.293,Trap-e-zium.
00:08:24.378,00:08:28.591,"Nope. No trapeziums, so, what shapes can we use?"
00:08:31.260,00:08:32.553,All of them!
00:08:33.471,00:08:35.765,"And drum roll, please."
00:08:36.057,00:08:39.519,Boo-da-doo!
00:08:39.602,00:08:41.979,"Now back to our story, to open that door!"
00:08:46.776,00:08:48.319,The door is open!
00:08:48.819,00:08:50.196,Yeh-hess!
00:08:50.863,00:08:52.782,"Ready, space explorers?"
00:08:53.908,00:08:57.161,The Red Planet! We're finally here!
00:08:57.245,00:08:58.955,Ah-mazing.
00:08:59.038,00:09:01.916,We have definitely never been here before.
00:09:04.293,00:09:07.255,"And look, the Silly Faces! There they go!"
00:09:07.630,00:09:10.174,"Stick with me, space explorers."
00:09:13.344,00:09:14.428,What was that?
00:09:15.179,00:09:16.389,I don't know.
00:09:19.559,00:09:22.562,Charlie... we made it to the Red Planet.
00:09:23.104,00:09:24.272,Can we just go home now?
00:09:25.022,00:09:26.857,I'm with Red on this one.
00:09:26.941,00:09:29.944,You don't want to keep following the Silly Faces?
00:09:30.027,00:09:31.445,"-No, thank you. -No."
00:09:31.529,00:09:33.322,But we're space explorers!
00:09:33.406,00:09:36.659,Red and Violet don't want to keep going where we've never been before!
00:09:39.453,00:09:41.455,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:43.416,00:09:46.127,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:09:46.210,00:09:48.421,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:49.589,00:09:52.925,"Co-captains, we're space explorers."
00:09:53.384,00:09:55.094,We don't know what we'll find...
00:09:55.386,00:09:59.098,But we could discover something new.
00:09:59.181,00:10:00.558,Together!

00:15:43.275,00:15:46.028,These sand castles are everywhere!
00:15:46.779,00:15:47.613,Look!
00:15:47.988,00:15:49.907,They're going to get to the hoop first!

00:15:59.291,00:16:01.669,Our story is getting sticky.
00:16:02.086,00:16:05.506,How can we get past the sand castles and get to the hoop?
00:16:09.677,00:16:10.761,Klunk can fly!
00:16:12.304,00:16:15.349,But he can't carry both of us at the same time.
00:16:18.227,00:16:19.853,Or can he?
00:16:21.105,00:16:24.608,Let's get creative and make this story even better.

00:16:33.742,00:16:35.119,We're going over.
00:16:35.953,00:16:38.414,"We're the Orange Drizzle, and we..."
00:16:38.789,00:16:40.332,-try our best! -Try our best!
00:16:45.921,00:16:48.215,"Oh, look at those Blueberries!"

00:17:01.311,00:17:02.730,Time for a...
00:17:03.105,00:17:05.190,weather change!
00:17:05.274,00:17:09.361,Let's cool things down with some snow!
00:17:09.445,00:17:11.405,Come on. Yeah.
00:17:15.492,00:17:18.287,Yuh-oh! Klunk can't fly in the snow.
00:17:18.370,00:17:20.372,It's too thick for him to see.
00:17:23.792,00:17:25.044,"It's okay, Klunk."
00:17:26.670,00:17:27.921,You tried your best.
00:17:29.381,00:17:30.966,"Good boy, Klunk."
00:17:31.425,00:17:33.427,"We can still do this, Oranges!"
00:17:33.510,00:17:41.685,"We'll just have to-- Whoa, snow! Snow!"
00:17:42.227,00:17:44.938,The snow is slippery!
00:17:48.108,00:17:50.652,Our story is getting stickier.
00:17:50.986,00:17:55.032,How can we get across the snow and get to the hoop?
00:17:59.036,00:18:02.289,-Blueberries! -Yeah!
00:18:03.332,00:18:04.625,Yeah!
00:18:05.042,00:18:07.127,I wish we had skis.
00:18:08.253,00:18:09.129,Colour up!
00:18:09.546,00:18:11.507,What if we did have skis?
00:18:11.799,00:18:16.095,We could add them to our bucket and make a super-fast sledge.
00:18:16.178,00:18:17.554,Brilliant!
00:18:18.347,00:18:20.265,Will you help me make a sledge?
00:18:22.017,00:18:26.021,Let's shake it up!
00:18:32.861,00:18:33.737,Okay.
00:18:33.821,00:18:35.781,We have our bucket.
00:18:36.323,00:18:38.033,Let's make it three buckets!
00:18:39.118,00:18:41.870,One bucket seat for each of us.
00:18:42.621,00:18:46.834,But which shape can we use to steer our sledge?
00:18:49.378,00:18:50.504,The circle!
00:18:51.713,00:18:53.423,I like it!
00:18:53.507,00:18:58.220,"Now, we need skis on the bottom of the sledge to glide over the snow."
00:18:58.637,00:19:01.056,Which shape can we use for skis?
00:19:04.226,00:19:06.228,How about this L shape?
00:19:07.479,00:19:09.815,We just need one more thing.
00:19:10.315,00:19:11.692,A rocket!
00:19:11.775,00:19:16.113,We need some speed so we can get our ball into the hoop first.
00:19:17.447,00:19:20.951,What shape could we use for a rocket on the back of a sledge?
00:19:24.037,00:19:25.622,How about the triangle?
00:19:26.832,00:19:30.669,Boo-da-doo!
00:19:31.420,00:19:34.131,Let's go get the ball in the cloud hoop.
00:19:34.214,00:19:35.340,Stick with me.
00:19:36.675,00:19:37.926,Yeh-hess!
00:19:42.055,00:19:43.473,Brilliant!
00:19:45.225,00:19:47.644,"You're going pretty fast, Oranges."
00:19:47.728,00:19:51.815,But how fast can you go around these... snowmen?
00:19:57.738,00:19:58.655,Nice!
00:19:58.739,00:20:00.866,"Come on, Blueberries! Faster!"
00:20:01.283,00:20:03.202,Let's get to that cloud hoop.
00:20:06.747,00:20:08.040,Tickle me pink!
00:20:08.332,00:20:10.083,I'm so excited!
00:20:10.292,00:20:11.919,We're almost at the hoop!
00:20:13.086,00:20:16.215,Did he say almost at the hoop?
00:20:16.298,00:20:20.385,It's time for another... weather change!
00:20:20.469,00:20:23.180,"Windy, windy, windy!"
00:20:28.936,00:20:32.898,"Octo-bocto, use your tentacles!"
00:20:33.190,00:20:35.817,Use your tentacles!
00:20:36.068,00:20:38.320,We're the Blueberry Tornadoes...
00:20:38.403,00:20:42.282,And... we're... amazing!
00:20:45.035,00:20:47.537,"Oh, no! The Blueberries are almost there!"
00:20:50.082,00:20:55.087,"The Blueberries are going to get the ball in the hoop first, and win the game!"
00:20:55.420,00:20:57.798,Just like they always do.
00:20:58.131,00:20:59.758,Colour me blue.
00:20:59.841,00:21:01.426,I'm so sad.
00:21:01.718,00:21:03.845,Is this how our story ends?
00:21:06.515,00:21:09.768,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:21:11.770,00:21:14.648,It's time for something big to happen.
00:21:14.898,00:21:16.984,"Oranges, I need your help."
00:21:17.067,00:21:20.487,We need to try our best to get the ball in the hoop...
00:21:20.570,00:21:23.031,-together! -Yeah!
00:21:24.741,00:21:27.744,"On three. One, two..."
00:21:28.370,00:21:29.579,three!
00:21:50.559,00:21:52.227,-Yes! -We did it!
00:21:53.312,00:21:58.191,And the winner is the Orange Drizzle!
00:21:58.567,00:22:01.903,"-That was ah-mazing! -Way to go, guys! Give me five!"
00:22:01.987,00:22:02.946,Thanks.
00:22:03.030,00:22:05.365,"You were all amazing, too."
00:22:05.449,00:22:08.035,"We're the Orange Drizzle, and we..."
00:22:08.118,00:22:10.037,-try our best! -Try our best!
00:22:10.329,00:22:11.496,"Whoo-hoo, yes!"
00:22:13.874,00:22:15.250,Or is it?
00:22:15.500,00:22:19.212,What if we played ball against a team of dragons?
00:22:21.757,00:22:24.384,What do you think would happen in that story?
00:22:27.554,00:22:30.390,You've got a story to create!
00:22:47.115,00:22:48.825,Hot sand. Yikes!
00:23:02.964,00:23:05.050,Hey! That tickles!
00:23:09.888,00:23:11.264,See you next time.
00:23:17.437,00:00:16.474,Subtitles translated by: I am an alien from outer space.
00:00:16.558,00:00:19.144,Heh heh! Just kidding.
00:00:28.111,00:00:29.946,What would you do there?
00:00:32.615,00:00:36.828,Hey! Do you know where we could really go to space?
00:00:41.249,00:00:44.419,Will you create a space explorer story with me?
00:00:46.629,00:00:49.215,I feel...
00:00:49.299,00:00:52.218,a story coming on!
00:00:53.261,00:00:55.096,Let's get this story started!
00:01:27.670,00:01:30.340,Let's get this story started. Once upon a time...
00:01:30.423,00:01:39.516,you and I... were space explorers about to take my rocket ship on a mission to space!
00:01:39.599,00:01:40.975,Hee-hee-yeah!
00:01:49.234,00:01:51.486,"Hey hey, Charlie!"
00:01:54.072,00:01:58.409,We're going somewhere we've never been before!
00:02:11.798,00:02:14.008,"Ha ha! Aye aye, Captains!"
00:02:14.092,00:02:17.387,"Just a little sticky magic, and..."
00:02:20.640,00:02:22.100,-All right! -Yes!
00:02:23.226,00:02:25.145,Whoa! Space is dark.
00:02:29.482,00:02:30.567,Whoop!
00:02:30.650,00:02:33.236,"Pilot, prepare to blast off."
00:02:37.073,00:02:38.616,Door's closing.
00:02:40.118,00:02:43.413,I'm going to drive our spaceship to...
00:02:52.463,00:02:54.257,"two, one..."
00:02:54.507,00:02:56.926,blast-off!

00:03:14.986,00:03:16.696,"Red Planet, Red Planet!"
00:03:16.779,00:03:18.615,To the Red Planet!
00:03:37.175,00:03:39.344,We don't know what we'll find.
00:04:13.461,00:04:19.467,Yuh-oh! We need to get these cat asteroids out of the way so we can keep following the Silly Faces.
00:04:31.229,00:04:33.022,A ball of yarn?
00:05:34.250,00:05:37.003,Let's be extra careful and go...
00:05:40.923,00:05:42.341,Or...
00:06:17.210,00:06:20.463,-Wait... -Whoa!
00:06:27.178,00:06:28.971,Is everyone OK?
00:06:29.263,00:06:32.308,Space is upside-down now.
00:06:42.401,00:06:45.363,Yuh-oh! The door won't unlock.
00:06:48.116,00:06:51.744,Color me green! I'm worried!
00:06:59.418,00:07:03.131,We can't get to where we've never been before if we can't open the door.
00:07:10.429,00:07:12.473,What do you think we should do next?
00:07:34.454,00:07:36.873,So we just need...
00:07:36.956,00:07:39.792,Yuh-oh! We don't have a circle!
00:07:39.876,00:07:41.794,What shapes can we use?
00:07:54.015,00:07:55.183,Nope.
00:07:55.266,00:07:57.768,Let me just turn it around...
00:08:11.240,00:08:13.910,Let's try these... rectangles!
00:08:17.371,00:08:18.581,Hee hee yeah!
00:08:24.337,00:08:28.549,"Nope. No trapezoids, so what shapes can we use?"
00:08:31.219,00:08:32.512,All of them!
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.896,"Now back to our story, to open that door!"
00:08:57.245,00:08:59.080,Amazing.
00:09:04.293,00:09:07.505,And look! The Silly Faces! There they go!
00:09:07.588,00:09:09.674,"Stick with me, space explorers."
00:09:12.760,00:09:14.178,-Uh! -What was that?
00:09:18.641,00:09:22.144,"Um, Charlie... we made it to the Red Planet."
00:09:22.937,00:09:24.230,Can we just go home now?
00:09:26.899,00:09:29.902,You don't want to keep following the Silly Faces?
00:09:29.986,00:09:31.487,"-No, thank you. -Uh, no."
00:09:31.571,00:09:33.489,But we're space explorers!
00:09:33.573,00:09:37.118,Red and Violet don't want to keep going where we've never been before!
00:09:37.201,00:09:41.205,They don't want to finish our mission. Is this how our story ends?
00:09:49.547,00:09:53.301,"Co-captains, we're space explorers."
00:09:53.384,00:09:56.220,-We don't know what we'll find... -But...
00:09:56.304,00:09:59.140,we could discover something new.
00:09:59.223,00:10:00.474,Together!
00:10:01.100,00:10:02.685,Let's go!
00:10:05.771,00:10:08.065,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:10:16.324,00:10:17.575,And look at these!
00:10:18.534,00:10:20.286,Space Silly Faces?
00:10:26.417,00:10:29.253,That's who ran by us!
00:10:29.337,00:10:31.255,They must be coming from all over!
00:10:35.885,00:10:36.844,-Hi. -Hi.
00:10:57.365,00:10:59.075,The end.
00:10:59.158,00:11:00.868,Or is it?
00:11:00.951,00:11:03.496,What if we see what planet that baby is going to?
00:11:05.039,00:11:07.375,What would happen next in that story?
00:11:18.135,00:11:19.929,Whoee-doh-doh!
00:11:20.012,00:11:22.139,That was a great story!
00:11:22.223,00:11:23.891,Ready for another one?
00:11:24.600,00:11:25.684,Stick with me.

00:11:56.924,00:12:00.678,I want to play in a big ballgame someday.
00:12:02.763,00:12:08.811,"Do you know where we could play in a big, big ballgame right now?"
00:12:09.603,00:12:11.230,In a story!
00:12:11.689,00:12:14.442,Will you create a ballgame story with me?
00:12:16.652,00:12:17.653,Yes!

00:13:00.404,00:13:02.740,"Once upon a time, you and I..."
00:13:02.823,00:13:05.409,were going to a big ballgame!
00:13:05.493,00:13:09.788,And a story like that needs a big setting! The...
00:13:09.872,00:13:14.210,Colorforms City Stadium!
00:13:21.175,00:13:23.219,And introducing...
00:13:23.302,00:13:27.681,"my team, the Orange Drizzle!"
00:13:30.559,00:13:32.770,"We're the Orange Drizzle, and we..."

00:13:52.331,00:13:54.416,Go Blueberries!
00:13:58.629,00:14:00.965,The Blueberries always win.
00:14:07.263,00:14:12.184,OK. First team to get their ball into the cloud hoop...
00:14:16.272,00:14:19.400,"...any way they can, wins."

00:14:42.715,00:14:44.091,"Come on, Oranges."
00:14:44.174,00:14:47.177,"We're the Blueberry Tornadoes, and we're..."
00:14:49.221,00:14:52.266,I'm trying my best. I'm trying my best.
00:14:53.851,00:14:54.852,Hold on!
00:14:57.146,00:15:00.566,Time for this game to... heat up.
00:15:08.157,00:15:11.952,And what does everyone like to do when it's hot?
00:15:15.039,00:15:17.666,And... go to the beach!
00:15:36.977,00:15:38.354,Hold on tight!

00:15:42.858,00:15:46.320,Aw! These sand castles are everywhere!
00:15:53.577,00:15:55.996,None of us can climb like that.
00:15:59.291,00:16:02.086,Our story's getting sticky.
00:16:02.169,00:16:05.464,How can we get past the sand castles and get to the hoop?
00:16:12.262,00:16:15.307,But he can't carry both of us at the same time.
00:16:15.391,00:16:16.767,Klunk klunk klunk!
00:16:18.185,00:16:19.812,Or can he?
00:16:21.063,00:16:24.775,Let's get creative and make this story even better.
00:16:24.858,00:16:27.861,"Just a little sticky magic, and..."
00:16:32.116,00:16:33.617,"Grab on, Klunk."
00:16:33.701,00:16:35.953,-We're goin' over. -Klunk!

00:17:26.587,00:17:27.963,You tried your best.
00:17:28.047,00:17:31.300,"Whaaah! Good boy, Klunk."
00:17:31.383,00:17:33.385,"We can still do this, Oranges!"
00:17:33.469,00:17:36.764,We'll just have to-- Whoa! Whoa...
00:17:48.108,00:17:50.903,Our story's getting stickier.
00:18:01.413,00:18:03.999,-Yeah-ha-ha-ha! Yeah! -Whoo!
00:18:04.249,00:18:07.086,Huh. I wish we had skis.
00:18:08.212,00:18:09.088,Color up!
00:18:09.505,00:18:11.715,What if we did have skis?
00:18:11.799,00:18:16.053,We could add them to our bucket and make a super-fast sled.
00:18:18.305,00:18:20.224,Will you help me make a sled?
00:18:21.975,00:18:25.813,Let's shake it up!
00:18:32.820,00:18:35.739,OK. We have our bucket.
00:18:42.538,00:18:46.667,But what shape can we use to steer our sled?
00:18:49.378,00:18:50.712,The circle!
00:18:58.637,00:19:00.764,Which shape can we use for skis?
00:19:04.184,00:19:06.562,How about this L shape?
00:19:07.437,00:19:09.773,We just need one more thing.
00:19:11.817,00:19:15.821,We need some speed so we can get our ball in the hoop first.
00:19:17.573,00:19:20.826,What shape could we use for a rocket on the back of a sled?
00:19:24.079,00:19:25.581,How about the triangle?
00:19:26.582,00:19:30.252,Boooo... dah... doo!
00:19:31.336,00:19:34.256,Let's go get the ball in the cloud hoop.

00:19:57.613,00:19:58.780,Nice!
00:20:01.283,00:20:02.868,Let's get to that cloud hoop.
00:20:06.455,00:20:10.292,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:20:10.375,00:20:12.127,We're almost at the hoop!

00:20:28.936,00:20:32.731,Octo-Bocto! Use your tentacles!
00:20:49.206,00:20:53.252,"Aw, the Blueberries are gonna get the ball in the hoop first..."
00:20:53.335,00:20:55.337,and win the game!
00:21:06.556,00:21:09.518,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:21:24.741,00:21:27.577,"On three. One, two..."
00:21:28.370,00:21:29.288,three!

00:22:11.997,00:22:13.707,The end.
00:22:13.790,00:22:15.500,Or is it?
00:22:15.584,00:22:19.171,What if we played ball against a team of dragons?
00:22:20.881,00:22:24.301,Ha ha! What do you think would happen in that story?
00:22:27.512,00:22:30.223,You've got a story to create!
00:22:43.945,00:22:46.448,Ahh! Ooh! Aah!

00:04:52.625,00:04:56.087,"The pancakes are extra-delicious today, Chef. What's in them?"
00:04:57.255,00:04:58.089,Well...
00:04:58.172,00:04:59.132,pancake stuff?
00:04:59.465,00:05:01.175,We'd like to take some home.
00:05:01.759,00:05:02.593,Okay.
00:05:03.052,00:05:05.096,The disguise is working.
00:05:05.179,00:05:06.681,They don't know it's me.
00:05:07.140,00:05:11.227,"Now I have a question for you, customers who I don't know."
00:05:11.769,00:05:13.271,I'm having a party.
00:05:13.354,00:05:16.691,What's something extra-special you want to do at a party?
00:05:17.108,00:05:20.028,-Easy question. Roll around in a ball pit. -Easy question. Roll around in a ball pit.
00:05:20.111,00:05:23.573,And it would have a slide that goes down into it.
00:05:23.656,00:05:28.953,"With a ladder for the slide and handlebars for the ladder, for safety."
00:05:32.206,00:05:33.082,I mean...
00:05:33.458,00:05:34.917,that's bonkers!
00:05:35.376,00:05:37.086,Enjoy your pancakes!
00:05:37.170,00:05:38.463,Toodle-oo!
00:05:40.923,00:05:41.799,Phew!
00:05:42.258,00:05:43.426,Phewf-a-doof!
00:05:44.802,00:05:48.389,"Octo-bocto, Violet and Red want a ball pit and a slide!"
00:05:48.473,00:05:51.225,"Yeah, I like their style."
00:05:51.309,00:05:55.355,Will you make an extra-special ball pit and slide with me?
00:06:08.368,00:06:09.452,Okay.
00:06:10.745,00:06:13.373,Red and Violet want a ball pit with a slide.
00:06:15.708,00:06:18.127,Let's use this oval for the pit.
00:06:22.006,00:06:24.884,And what shape should we use for the balls?
00:06:27.804,00:06:29.722,"Circles, of course."
00:06:31.557,00:06:33.393,Lots of circles.
00:06:35.186,00:06:36.771,And now for the slide.
00:06:38.272,00:06:41.901,Which of these shapes looks the most slide-y?
00:06:44.779,00:06:47.156,How about this one?
00:06:50.034,00:06:53.496,Let's make this slide a rainbow!
00:06:53.996,00:06:55.498,We have red.
00:06:55.581,00:06:57.875,Which colour comes next in the rainbow?
00:06:59.752,00:07:00.795,Orange!
00:07:01.462,00:07:02.964,Say the colours with me.
00:07:03.047,00:07:06.801,"Yellow, green, blue, and purple!"
00:07:07.135,00:07:09.971,"And the ladder, with railings for safety."
00:07:11.472,00:07:14.225,"And drum roll, please..."
00:07:15.268,00:07:16.602,Boo-da-doo!
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.063,I like it!
00:07:19.147,00:07:21.482,Let's go finish our mission.
00:07:23.651,00:07:26.487,"Oh, yeah. Ball pit and slide."
00:07:26.571,00:07:28.030,It's party time.
00:07:28.114,00:07:29.574,"Not yet, Octo-bocto."
00:07:29.657,00:07:35.830,We need to do the last part of our mission: invite other guests to yell surprise!
00:07:35.913,00:07:37.957,And I'll invite Violet and Red!
00:07:38.040,00:07:42.462,"I'll tell them to come to your house, but I won't tell them why."
00:07:42.545,00:07:44.046,"Right, Agent Charlie?"
00:07:44.630,00:07:45.631,Charlie?
00:07:46.674,00:07:48.634,He is good.
00:07:56.767,00:07:58.311,Sunny skies!
00:07:58.394,00:08:00.062,"-There are Miss Weather, Dragon... -What a day!"
00:08:00.146,00:08:01.147,...and Chicken!
00:08:01.230,00:08:02.773,Let's go and invite them!
00:08:03.357,00:08:04.692,Ya-ya-yoinks!
00:08:04.775,00:08:06.903,Violet and Red are right there!
00:08:06.986,00:08:11.532,I've got to invite our friends to the surprise party without ruining the surprise.
00:08:13.743,00:08:15.953,Our story is getting stickier.
00:08:16.037,00:08:20.500,How can I invite the other guests without Violet and Red seeing me?
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.044,We've got to think like agents.
00:08:23.836,00:08:26.422,I know! I need another disguise.
00:08:33.554,00:08:36.015,I'm a flowery apple-y bush!
00:08:36.349,00:08:37.767,Do you recognise me?
00:08:39.101,00:08:40.228,Stick with me.
00:08:42.980,00:08:45.191,Have you seen Charlie anywhere today?
00:08:45.483,00:08:47.693,No. I haven't seen him anywhere.
00:08:49.654,00:08:51.489,My disguise is working!
00:08:54.492,00:08:55.493,What?
00:08:55.868,00:08:57.912,"Oh, it's you, Charlie."
00:08:59.288,00:09:05.169,"I'm here to invite you to a surprise party for Violet and Red, where we all get to yell surprise!"
00:09:06.796,00:09:07.630,Fun!
00:09:09.715,00:09:10.883,"Hey, hey, friends."
00:09:10.967,00:09:13.636,"Nothing. No one. I mean, hi!"
00:09:14.762,00:09:16.973,"Phew, that was close."
00:09:17.056,00:09:18.266,Let's go!
00:09:21.060,00:09:22.520,"Whoa, nice!"
00:09:22.937,00:09:23.813,Yes!
00:09:24.772,00:09:26.315,"It's great, Charlie!"
00:09:28.359,00:09:30.361,"It's surprise party time, everyone!"
00:09:30.444,00:09:32.905,Don't forget to yell surprise!
00:09:34.448,00:09:37.910,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:09:39.870,00:09:41.289,Surprise!
00:09:42.290,00:09:43.916,It's not them.
00:09:44.375,00:09:45.543,It's just a...
00:09:46.961,00:09:49.130,heavy box.
00:09:50.590,00:09:52.300,Are they not coming?
00:09:56.304,00:09:58.598,Is this how our story ends?
00:10:00.308,00:10:03.728,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:10:04.812,00:10:06.689,It's time for something big to happen.
00:10:06.772,00:10:08.899,-Surprise! -What?!
00:10:08.983,00:10:10.484,Violet and Red?
00:10:10.568,00:10:13.029,Plot twist! They're here!
00:10:15.072,00:10:17.408,We really surprised you.
00:10:18.326,00:10:19.160,Charlie...
00:10:19.535,00:10:21.912,why is it so dark in here?
00:10:22.496,00:10:26.083,Surprise!
00:10:26.792,00:10:30.463,And now we surprised you.
00:10:30.546,00:10:32.006,"-Yeah, you did. -Yeah, you did."
00:10:34.550,00:10:37.553,Is that a ball pit with a slide?
00:10:37.887,00:10:40.431,And a ladder with railings for safety?
00:10:41.265,00:10:42.933,"Why, yes, it is."
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.270,You're Chef Bonkers?
00:10:46.812,00:10:48.981,You did all of this for us?
00:10:49.065,00:10:50.274,"Thanks, Charlie!"
00:10:50.733,00:10:53.611,-Best surprise ever! -Best surprise ever!
00:10:56.030,00:10:57.907,"Red, isn't this the best?"
00:10:57.990,00:10:59.158,The end.
00:10:59.450,00:11:01.035,Or is it?
00:11:01.285,00:11:04.080,Who should the next surprise party be for?
00:11:05.748,00:11:08.250,What would happen next in that story?
00:11:11.212,00:11:13.923,You've got a story to create!
00:11:22.098,00:11:23.933,Ready for another one?
00:11:24.433,00:11:25.518,Stick with me.
00:11:30.147,00:11:31.065,No.
00:11:31.691,00:11:32.900,"Oh, hello there."
00:11:32.983,00:11:34.443,"It's me, Charlie."
00:11:34.527,00:11:39.990,I'm hunting for my favourite pair of sparkly-warkly sunglasses!
00:11:40.074,00:11:43.452,I'm on a sunglasses treasure hunt.
00:11:45.955,00:11:46.789,Nope.
00:11:49.125,00:11:49.959,Nope!
00:11:50.042,00:11:51.085,And...
00:11:51.669,00:11:53.379,No!
00:11:57.675,00:11:59.427,Guess I have to keep looking!
00:11:59.510,00:12:02.888,"Hey, what if we went on a real treasure hunt..."
00:12:03.139,00:12:04.807,in a story!
00:12:05.099,00:12:07.768,Will you create a treasure hunt story with me?
00:12:09.729,00:12:14.984,I feel a story coming on!
00:12:16.277,00:12:17.862,Let's get this story started!
00:12:17.945,00:12:22.450,Charlie's Colorforms City Yeah -Say hey -Hey!
00:12:22.533,00:12:23.576,-Say hey -Hey!

00:12:35.671,00:12:37.298,Let's give that plot a twist!
00:12:37.381,00:12:50.352,"Charlie's Colorforms City Yeah Let's make something great We've got a brand-new story to create Let's get this story started, treasure hunters."
00:12:50.436,00:12:56.859,"EPISODE TITLE Once upon a time, you and I were in the jungle..."
00:13:00.946,00:13:04.074,with our friends Violet and Red!
00:13:11.123,00:13:12.708,When suddenly...
00:13:13.125,00:13:14.084,Treasure.
00:13:14.710,00:13:16.045,Treasure!

00:13:17.713,00:13:19.298,Treasure!
00:13:19.632,00:13:21.133,It's coming from over there!
00:13:25.471,00:13:27.598,Treasure!
00:13:28.474,00:13:29.934,It's Marina!
00:13:31.602,00:13:34.396,"-Hey, hey, Marina. -Hi, friends."
00:13:34.480,00:13:35.606,What's wrong?
00:13:35.689,00:13:41.612,"Today is the day I'm supposed to get my very own treasure, like my older sisters."
00:13:43.280,00:13:46.033,My treasure lets me speak to dolphins.
00:13:49.578,00:13:52.206,And my treasure lets me speak to rocks.
00:13:56.001,00:13:57.461,She says hi.
00:13:59.004,00:14:01.632,"What does your treasure let you speak to, Marina?"
00:14:02.174,00:14:03.175,I don't know.
00:14:03.259,00:14:05.594,I need to find my treasure.
00:14:05.678,00:14:07.680,But all I have is this clue.
00:14:07.763,00:14:11.392,We can help you. We're treasure hunters in this story!
00:14:12.518,00:14:13.936,Fin-tastic!
00:14:14.019,00:14:15.980,What does my clue mean? What does it mean?
00:14:16.605,00:14:18.816,So this is a picture of...
00:14:21.819,00:14:23.320,It looks like...
00:14:27.283,00:14:28.409,Let me see!
00:14:33.706,00:14:35.624,I can't figure it out either.
00:14:35.916,00:14:39.044,Yuh-oh! None of us can figure out the clue!
00:14:40.963,00:14:43.173,Our story is getting sticky.
00:14:43.257,00:14:45.134,Will you help us figure it out?
00:14:46.969,00:14:51.181,"It's a shape picture, so we need to fill it in with shapes."
00:14:51.557,00:14:55.644,Let's shake it up!
00:15:02.109,00:15:02.985,Okay.
00:15:03.444,00:15:06.322,What shapes can we use for this big rectangle?
00:15:08.115,00:15:09.366,No rectangle.
00:15:10.492,00:15:13.787,Let's try... these two squares!
00:15:14.705,00:15:16.749,"Yes, yes, yes, yes!"
00:15:18.208,00:15:20.085,I don't know what it is yet.
00:15:21.337,00:15:24.465,What shape do we need for this big triangle?
00:15:28.218,00:15:29.887,"The triangle, of course."
00:15:31.639,00:15:32.473,Wait.
00:15:32.556,00:15:34.058,It's too small.
00:15:34.934,00:15:40.064,"We need another one, just like this one, but flipped."
00:15:44.151,00:15:46.695,Let's add these thin rectangles.
00:15:47.029,00:15:49.490,"Now, what does that look like?"
00:15:52.201,00:15:53.369,It's a ship!
00:15:54.370,00:15:55.955,The clue is a ship!
00:15:57.498,00:16:00.334,But there's still these circles and triangles.
00:16:01.794,00:16:04.338,Hey! Those look like fish!
00:16:04.838,00:16:07.716,The ship is... underwater?
00:16:08.634,00:16:12.846,Boo-da-doo!
00:16:13.555,00:16:14.890,We solved the clue.
00:16:15.182,00:16:17.476,But why would a ship be underwater?
00:16:17.559,00:16:19.603,Let's go see if Marina knows.
00:16:21.146,00:16:23.691,Our clue is this underwater ship.
00:16:24.233,00:16:25.067,Cool!
00:16:26.068,00:16:28.779,That's the shipwreck in the Colour Sea!
00:16:29.113,00:16:31.532,That's where my treasure must be!
00:16:33.534,00:16:34.868,Follow me.
00:16:35.160,00:16:37.037,Vio-let's do this.
00:16:37.997,00:16:39.415,Stick with us.
00:16:42.042,00:16:43.711,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:16:45.587,00:16:48.257,These jellyfish follow me everywhere.
00:16:51.093,00:16:52.261,The shipwreck!
00:16:52.344,00:16:53.971,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:16:54.763,00:16:57.266,Tickle me pink. I'm so excited!
00:16:57.349,00:16:59.560,It's treasure hunting time!
00:16:59.977,00:17:02.563,Give me a ca-caw if you find it.
00:17:04.732,00:17:05.649,Nope.
00:17:06.025,00:17:07.401,Maybe over there.
00:17:07.484,00:17:09.528,Treasure? Treasure?
00:17:09.820,00:17:10.738,Treasure?
00:17:13.365,00:17:14.491,No.
00:17:16.869,00:17:18.620,I think I've got it!
00:17:19.747,00:17:20.831,You've got my treasure?
00:17:28.047,00:17:29.256,Again?
00:17:29.798,00:17:31.258,But we followed the clue.
00:17:31.341,00:17:33.177,Why is there no treasure?
00:17:34.595,00:17:39.391,"Without my treasure, I'll never be able to talk to anything the way my sisters do."
00:17:40.768,00:17:43.479,Our story is getting stickier.
00:17:43.562,00:17:45.856,"What should we do next, storytellers?"
00:17:48.484,00:17:50.402,Hold your seahorses.
00:17:50.486,00:17:52.154,"I mean, ca-caw!"
00:17:52.529,00:17:53.697,Look at this shell.
00:17:54.073,00:17:56.742,"It's shimmering, just like your first clue, Marina."
00:17:57.201,00:17:58.577,Another clue?
00:18:00.412,00:18:04.041,I don't know what this one means either. Will we ever find my treasure?
00:18:05.626,00:18:06.960,"Don't worry, Marina."
00:18:07.044,00:18:09.338,"We can solve this one, too."
00:18:09.421,00:18:11.048,"Right, treasure hunters?"
00:18:11.131,00:18:12.132,Right.
00:18:12.216,00:18:14.009,It's a... smiley-face.
00:18:14.676,00:18:15.511,I think.
00:18:15.594,00:18:17.971,Or a fancy mop?
00:18:18.931,00:18:21.225,I really want to help Marina.
00:18:21.558,00:18:25.771,You and I need to figure this out so we can find the treasure.
00:18:26.230,00:18:30.317,Let's shake it up!
00:18:37.658,00:18:38.534,Okay.
00:18:38.617,00:18:40.828,Let's start with these triangles!
00:18:42.121,00:18:43.747,Right here.
00:18:44.540,00:18:46.583,And we need a few more.
00:18:52.840,00:18:54.591,And now the diamonds.
00:18:58.053,00:18:59.429,No diamonds.
00:18:59.805,00:19:02.474,What shapes can we use to make the diamonds?
00:19:05.227,00:19:07.187,Let's try these triangles.
00:19:07.521,00:19:10.858,"A triangle here, and a triangle there."
00:19:11.400,00:19:12.693,That's a diamond!
00:19:15.112,00:19:16.864,Have you figured out the clue?
00:19:18.282,00:19:19.491,Me neither.
00:19:20.367,00:19:21.535,Hey!
00:19:21.618,00:19:24.580,Maybe we need to look at this a different way!
00:19:27.583,00:19:29.042,Do you see what I see?
00:19:29.126,00:19:30.711,I think it's a palm tree!
00:19:31.128,00:19:34.089,With... diamond coconuts?
00:19:34.173,00:19:35.007,Let's see.
00:19:35.090,00:19:39.178,Boo-da-doo!
00:19:40.012,00:19:42.431,I hope Marina knows what this means.
00:19:42.598,00:19:44.808,Let's get back to our story.
00:19:46.101,00:19:50.105,"Marina, the clue is a palm tree with diamond coconuts."
00:19:50.397,00:19:54.526,A sparkly palm tree with warkly diamond coconuts?
00:19:55.360,00:19:57.404,Sparkly Warkly Island!
00:19:57.487,00:20:01.742,My sparkly-warkly treasure must be on Sparkly Warkly Island!
00:20:01.825,00:20:03.118,Let's shake a tail.
00:20:04.286,00:20:06.330,-Vio-let's get going! -Everybody's going!
00:20:09.291,00:20:10.250,This is it.
00:20:10.334,00:20:12.753,Sparkly Warkly Island.
00:20:12.836,00:20:15.339,Does anyone see my treasure?
00:20:16.381,00:20:17.966,Maybe over here?
00:20:18.383,00:20:19.635,Let's look over here.
00:20:22.346,00:20:24.097,I don't see any treasure.
00:20:24.681,00:20:26.850,"Can I talk to you, pile of sand?"
00:20:28.435,00:20:29.853,"How's it going, crab?"
00:20:32.231,00:20:34.608,I can't talk to anything!
00:20:34.691,00:20:37.069,Maybe I'll never find my treasure.
00:20:37.945,00:20:39.321,"Oh, Marina."
00:20:39.821,00:20:41.198,Colour me blue.
00:20:41.406,00:20:42.950,I'm so sad.
00:20:43.033,00:20:46.078,I really wanted to find your treasure for you.
00:20:46.286,00:20:48.330,Is this how our story ends?
00:20:51.208,00:20:54.294,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:20:55.712,00:20:57.714,Charlie! Over here!
00:21:02.010,00:21:04.012,Almost... got it!
00:21:04.096,00:21:05.305,It's a...
00:21:07.683,00:21:09.309,Treasure chest!
00:21:10.394,00:21:12.145,Found it!
00:21:14.022,00:21:16.191,My treasure!
00:21:19.069,00:21:20.570,"The treasure, it's..."
00:21:22.447,00:21:23.824,a stick?
00:21:24.574,00:21:25.826,Plot twist!
00:21:26.618,00:21:27.995,Or...
00:21:30.706,00:21:33.417,my treasure!
00:21:33.792,00:21:36.378,-Whoa-doh-doh! -Ah-mazing!
00:21:38.922,00:21:40.841,The jellyfish!
00:21:40.924,00:21:43.093,I can hear what they're saying!
00:21:43.176,00:21:46.596,My treasure lets me talk to jellyfish!
00:21:46.680,00:21:48.223,What are they saying?
00:21:51.977,00:21:53.312,They're lost.
00:21:53.478,00:21:56.857,They've been following me because they don't know how to get home!
00:21:56.940,00:21:59.318,"It's okay, little jellies. I can help."
00:21:59.401,00:22:00.694,You just...
00:22:05.866,00:22:07.868,"You're welcome, jellies!"
00:22:07.951,00:22:09.536,Come back soon!
00:22:12.914,00:22:14.124,The end.
00:22:15.542,00:22:16.626,Or is it?
00:22:16.835,00:22:19.713,My sparkly-warkly sunglasses!
00:22:19.796,00:22:21.673,I found my treasure!
00:22:22.257,00:22:25.260,What if you had a treasure? What would it be?
00:23:02.964,00:23:04.966,Hey! That tickles!
00:23:09.805,00:23:11.348,See you next time.
00:23:17.437,00:00:13.888,Subtitles translated by: Hi! I'm Charlie.
00:00:24.733,00:00:27.861,I love surprises.
00:00:36.745,00:00:46.629,"When you plan a party for a friend, but they don't know, and then they walk in and everyone yells, Surprise!"
00:00:56.765,00:00:58.767,In a story!
00:00:58.850,00:01:02.103,Will you tell a surprise party story with me?
00:01:03.855,00:01:06.441,I feel...
00:01:10.487,00:01:12.280,Let's get this story started!
00:01:57.575,00:02:00.120,See? Violet and Red.
00:02:00.203,00:02:02.664,Just like their names. Hee hee hee!
00:02:23.518,00:02:27.522,-I'm gonna get extra blueberries. -Oh! Great idea! Ha ha!
00:02:31.860,00:02:35.029,We've gotta kind of be sneaky to plan this party.
00:02:58.219,00:02:59.470,Stick with us.
00:03:12.525,00:03:16.154,Octo-Bocto! We brought more decorations.
00:03:16.237,00:03:18.197,Octo-Bocto?
00:03:20.909,00:03:25.330,Octo-Bocto! You always surprise me.
00:03:25.413,00:03:28.166,'Cause I'm a master of disguises...
00:03:34.422,00:03:36.799,Violet and Red are going to love this!
00:03:52.023,00:03:55.735,I can't ask them. Then it won't be a surprise!
00:03:59.572,00:04:05.036,"You can't ask them, but what if you looked like someone else?"
00:04:12.669,00:04:17.131,What's a good disguise to wear at the Pancake Cafe so Red and Violet don't know it's me?
00:04:20.218,00:04:21.469,Pilot?
00:04:22.303,00:04:24.555,Shoe? Hee hee hee!
00:05:05.179,00:05:07.056,They don't know it's me.
00:05:07.140,00:05:11.686,"Now I have a question for you, customers who I don't know."
00:05:11.769,00:05:16.983,I'm having a party. What's something extra-special you would want to do at a party?
00:05:23.656,00:05:31.247,With a ladder for the slide and handlebars for the ladder I like it!
00:05:32.206,00:05:35.293,"I mean, that's bonkers!"
00:05:40.923,00:05:42.175,Whew!
00:05:51.309,00:05:55.354,Will you make an extra-special ball pit and slide with me?
00:06:10.745,00:06:13.372,Red and Violet want a ball pit with a slide.
00:06:14.207,00:06:15.625,Hmm.
00:06:22.006,00:06:25.009,And what shape should we use for the balls?
00:06:31.474,00:06:33.518,Lots of circles.
00:06:35.103,00:06:36.687,And now for the slide.
00:06:38.272,00:06:41.734,Which of these shapes looks the most slide-y?
00:06:49.158,00:06:53.746,Ooh! Let's make this slide a rainbow!
00:06:53.830,00:06:58.084,We have red. Which color comes next in the rainbow?
00:07:07.135,00:07:10.346,"And the ladder, with railings for safety."
00:07:10.429,00:07:11.472,Hee hee hee!
00:07:15.268,00:07:16.811,Boo-dah-doo!
00:07:45.715,00:07:49.010,Hmp. He is good.
00:07:58.394,00:08:01.189,There are Ms. Weather and Dragon and Chicken!
00:08:03.357,00:08:04.775,Yeah-yeah-yoinks!
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.294,We've got to think like agents.
00:08:33.554,00:08:36.265,I'm a flowery-apple-y bush!
00:08:36.349,00:08:38.726,Do you recognize me? Hee hee hee!
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.478,Stick with me.
00:08:42.605,00:08:45.024,Have you seen Charlie anywhere today?
00:09:07.713,00:09:08.798,Shh!
00:09:09.590,00:09:10.925,"Hey hey, friends."
00:09:30.444,00:09:32.697,Don't forget to yell Surprise!
00:09:42.290,00:09:44.333,It's not them.
00:10:00.308,00:10:03.561,Not if we're the ones telling this story!
00:10:17.491,00:10:19.285,"Uh, Charlie..."
00:10:34.550,00:10:37.803,Is that a ball pit with a slide?
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.520,You're Chef Bonkers?
00:10:57.990,00:11:01.285,The end. Or is it?
00:11:01.369,00:11:04.246,Who should the next surprise party be for?
00:11:11.087,00:11:13.589,You've got a story to create!
00:11:27.603,00:11:28.729,Hmm.
00:11:29.980,00:11:31.482,No.
00:11:31.565,00:11:32.983,"Oh, hello there."
00:11:40.074,00:11:43.911,I'm on a sunglasses treasure hunt. Hee hee hee!
00:11:45.955,00:11:46.997,Nope.
00:11:47.373,00:11:49.667,Uh... nope!
00:11:50.042,00:11:51.585,And...
00:11:56.882,00:11:59.385,Hee hee hee! Guess I have to keep looking!
00:11:59.468,00:12:03.139,"Hey, what if we went on a real treasure hunt..."
00:12:03.222,00:12:05.015,in a story!
00:12:05.099,00:12:07.685,Will you create a treasure hunt story with me?
00:12:09.603,00:12:12.189,I feel...
00:12:16.277,00:12:17.945,Let's get this story started.
00:12:46.724,00:12:49.268,"Let's get this story started, treasure hunters!"
00:13:16.128,00:13:17.421,-Huh? What? -Huh?
00:13:17.505,00:13:19.548,Treasure!
00:13:19.632,00:13:21.342,It's coming from over there!
00:13:30.017,00:13:31.393,Ohh.
00:14:01.715,00:14:05.636,Ohh! I don't know. I need to find my treasure.
00:14:18.899,00:14:20.901,um...
00:14:25.698,00:14:26.991,uh...
00:14:29.827,00:14:31.370,Hmm.
00:14:33.581,00:14:35.833,I can't figure it out either.
00:15:02.109,00:15:03.360,OK.
00:15:03.444,00:15:06.864,What shapes can we use for this big rectangle?
00:15:06.947,00:15:09.450,Hmm. No rectangle.
00:15:10.492,00:15:13.579,Let's try... these two squares!
00:15:31.555,00:15:34.224,Wait. It's too small.
00:15:42.024,00:15:43.442,Hmm.
00:15:44.151,00:15:46.946,Let's add these thin rectangles.
00:16:08.634,00:16:12.388,Boo... dah... doo!
00:16:13.555,00:16:15.099,We solved the clue.
00:16:21.146,00:16:23.524,Our clue is this underwater ship.
00:16:28.862,00:16:31.407,That's where my treasure must be!
00:16:33.534,00:16:35.077,Follow me.
00:16:37.997,00:16:39.581,Stick with us.
00:16:54.513,00:16:57.391,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:17:11.530,00:17:13.282,"Oh, maybe here!"
00:17:34.595,00:17:39.349,"Without my treasure, I'll never be able to talk to anything the way my sisters do."
00:17:52.237,00:17:54.156,Look at this shell.
00:18:02.372,00:18:04.083,Will we ever find my treasure?
00:18:14.676,00:18:15.803,I think.
00:18:15.886,00:18:18.263,Or a fancy mop?
00:18:18.931,00:18:21.475,I really want to help Marina.
00:18:37.658,00:18:40.953,OK. Let's start with these triangles!
00:18:41.036,00:18:43.539,Hmm. Right here.
00:18:49.044,00:18:51.880,And here are the semi-circles.
00:18:57.052,00:18:59.596,Hmm. No diamonds.
00:18:59.680,00:19:02.808,What shapes can we use to make the diamonds?
00:19:05.060,00:19:07.437,Let's try these triangles.
00:19:11.400,00:19:12.901,That's a diamond!
00:19:15.112,00:19:16.989,Have you figured out the clue?
00:19:18.240,00:19:20.117,Me neither.
00:19:20.200,00:19:24.288,Hey! Maybe we need to look at this a different way!
00:19:31.086,00:19:35.090,With... diamond coconuts? Let's see.
00:19:35.174,00:19:38.802,Boo... dah... doo!
00:19:40.012,00:19:42.598,I hope Marina knows what this means.
00:19:50.189,00:19:54.776,A sparkly palm tree with warkly diamond coconuts?
00:20:28.268,00:20:30.062,"How's it goin', crab?"
00:20:34.691,00:20:37.277,Maybe I'll never find my treasure.
00:20:37.945,00:20:41.406,"Oh, Marina. Color me blue."
00:21:04.096,00:21:05.097,It's... a...
00:21:24.574,00:21:25.951,Plot twist!
00:21:26.618,00:21:28.370,Or...
00:21:43.010,00:21:46.805,My treasure lets me talk to jellyfish!
00:21:51.977,00:21:56.940,They're lost! They've been following me because they don't know how to get home!
00:21:59.401,00:22:00.986,You just...
00:22:07.951,00:22:09.911,Come back soon!
00:22:12.998,00:22:14.666,The end.
00:23:09.262,00:23:11.723,See you next time.
00:00:06.006,00:00:12.554,A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Yee-haw!
00:00:13.013,00:00:14.180,"Giddy-up, horsey!"
00:00:16.266,00:00:17.976,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:00:22.522,00:00:23.940,"Bye, horsey!"
00:00:32.657,00:00:35.160,I wish I could ride a real horse...
00:00:37.704,00:00:39.914,like a cowboy!
00:00:47.338,00:00:49.507,In a story!
00:00:50.091,00:00:53.219,Will you create a cowboy and cowgirl story with me?
00:00:54.804,00:00:55.638,Okay.

00:03:16.196,00:03:20.366,We need a way to show who's really the best once and for all.
00:03:20.825,00:03:23.161,Our story is getting sticky.
00:03:24.037,00:03:28.583,"What should we do next, storytellers? How can we show who's the best?"
00:03:30.293,00:03:34.047,-The sheriff's coming! -And the other sheriff!
00:03:34.672,00:03:37.300,-I'm the sheriff. -We're co-sheriffs.

00:03:39.135,00:03:43.890,"A silly bandit took my sheriff hat, and now we have to share this one."
00:03:44.599,00:03:48.394,And the sheriff hat is the most fun part about being a sheriff.

00:04:38.403,00:04:39.237,No.
00:04:45.493,00:04:46.995,Where could that hat be?
00:04:48.621,00:04:51.291,I really want to show I'm the best.
00:04:53.501,00:04:55.878,"The hat! Good work, Giddyup."
00:04:56.296,00:04:59.007,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:04:59.465,00:05:01.050,Let's go get it.
00:05:05.638,00:05:07.515,The bandit still has it.
00:05:09.475,00:05:12.770,"Excuse me, will you give us your hat?"
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.064,My hat?!
00:05:15.481,00:05:17.775,No one take it.
00:05:18.109,00:05:22.572,So hot! So hot!
00:05:23.364,00:05:26.159,The bandit's using the hat to cool herself down.
00:05:26.242,00:05:28.036,She won't give it to us.
00:05:31.456,00:05:34.000,Our story is getting stickier.
00:05:34.334,00:05:37.795,What if we gave her something else to cool herself down?
00:05:40.423,00:05:41.424,A fruit pop?
00:05:41.758,00:05:43.343,"Good idea, Giddyup."
00:05:43.885,00:05:45.553,Those are cold.
00:05:46.471,00:05:52.185,And let's get creative and make this story even better.
00:05:52.393,00:05:55.188,Let's make a fruit pop truck.
00:05:57.273,00:06:00.026,Or an Old West fruit pop truck wagon.
00:06:01.152,00:06:02.320,Colour up!
00:06:02.528,00:06:07.158,We're going to get the bandit to trade the hat for a pop.
00:06:07.742,00:06:10.161,Will you make a fruit pop wagon with me?
00:06:12.997,00:06:17.335,Let's shake it up!
00:06:24.967,00:06:25.927,Okay.
00:06:26.386,00:06:29.389,What shape can we use for the wagon's wheels?
00:06:32.850,00:06:34.769,How about these circles?
00:06:38.898,00:06:41.317,"Now, what shape can we use for the wagon?"
00:06:44.529,00:06:46.114,Let's try the rectangle.
00:06:55.248,00:06:57.500,What shape can we use for the window?
00:07:02.422,00:07:10.930,"And let's add a triangle so we can clang, clang, clang and let everyone know it's fruit pop time."
00:07:17.520,00:07:19.355,Boo-da-doo!
00:07:19.439,00:07:25.069,Let's get back to our story and get that hat before Cowgirl Weather.
00:07:25.403,00:07:27.029,Yippety yee-haw!
00:07:34.328,00:07:36.414,Ice-cold fruit pops for sale.

00:07:40.710,00:07:42.712,One hat for one pop.
00:07:43.379,00:07:44.297,Me!
00:07:44.547,00:07:46.591,"-Me, me, me! -Thanks for coming, partner."

00:07:59.270,00:08:00.646,Colour me green.
00:08:01.272,00:08:02.482,I'm worried.
00:08:02.773,00:08:06.110,I hope the bandit wants to trade her hat for a fruit pop.
00:08:07.570,00:08:10.740,You look like you could use a cold treat.
00:08:11.324,00:08:16.704,I'll trade you this nice cold fruit pop for your nice star hat.
00:08:17.163,00:08:19.832,"One pop, one hat."

00:10:02.435,00:10:05.521,Not if we're the ones telling the story.
00:10:05.771,00:10:08.858,It's time for something big to happen.
00:10:09.525,00:10:14.947,"Cowgirl Weather, I reckon we have to be the best together."

00:16:29.780,00:16:31.907,Introducing my latest invention.
00:16:32.157,00:16:36.620,"Radical, rolly, raspberry pancakes."
00:16:38.622,00:16:39.832,-Balloon! -Balloon!
00:16:39.915,00:16:40.874,Balloon!
00:16:41.250,00:16:42.167,What?
00:16:42.292,00:16:43.293,Babies?
00:16:46.463,00:16:47.548,Pancake!
00:16:49.341,00:16:50.384,Pancake!
00:16:51.176,00:16:55.014,"Violet? How rolly were those radical, rolly raspberry pancakes?"
00:16:56.598,00:16:58.142,Really rolly.
00:16:58.225,00:16:59.226,De-do!
00:16:59.935,00:17:00.978,Too rolly.
00:17:01.061,00:17:02.771,-De-do! -Too fast.
00:17:04.773,00:17:05.983,Yuh-oh!
00:17:06.066,00:17:10.029,Now the Silly Face Babies are loose in Colorforms City!
00:17:11.030,00:17:13.407,Our story is getting stickier.
00:17:15.242,00:17:17.911,"Storyteller, what should we do next?"
00:17:20.956,00:17:22.833,Idea break!
00:17:31.550,00:17:32.843,How about a cot?
00:17:33.802,00:17:35.220,On wheels.
00:17:36.847,00:17:37.890,Yes!
00:17:38.098,00:17:41.518,And let's put a scoop on the front.
00:17:42.102,00:17:45.397,To scoop the babies up and pop them in.
00:17:45.731,00:17:47.149,-I like it. -Brilliant.
00:17:47.232,00:17:48.609,Ah-mazing.
00:17:50.611,00:17:52.529,This invention better work.
00:17:52.821,00:17:54.531,Will you help me create it?
00:17:56.116,00:18:00.245,Let's shake it up!
00:18:06.418,00:18:07.252,Okay.
00:18:07.628,00:18:11.215,These two rectangles can be the sides of the cot.
00:18:11.465,00:18:13.884,And now we need to connect them together.
00:18:15.302,00:18:17.012,What shapes can we use?
00:18:19.848,00:18:21.809,How about these long rectangles?
00:18:22.518,00:18:23.393,Yes!
00:18:23.727,00:18:27.648,And these ten rectangles will keep the babies safe inside.
00:18:27.815,00:18:32.945,"Now, how about some fast wheels to catch up with those rolly babies?"
00:18:34.238,00:18:36.615,What shapes can we use for wheels?
00:18:39.701,00:18:41.286,How about these circles?
00:18:42.538,00:18:45.374,"And last but not least, our scooper."
00:18:45.833,00:18:48.085,What shape can we use for scooping?
00:18:51.296,00:18:54.216,Let's use the semicircle for scooping.
00:18:56.135,00:18:57.678,boo-da-doo!
00:18:58.345,00:19:00.347,This cot is ready to roll.
00:19:00.806,00:19:03.517,Let's go get those babies.
00:19:05.727,00:19:10.732,"Introducing our latest invention, the Super Scooper Cot!"
00:19:11.275,00:19:13.402,-Yeh-hess! -Vio-let's get going.
00:19:13.694,00:19:14.528,Wait!

00:19:40.679,00:19:42.681,Activate scooping mode.
00:19:44.099,00:19:46.185,"Got you, cutie patooties."
00:19:49.104,00:19:50.272,Yum! Yum! Yum!

00:20:31.813,00:20:33.065,"Oh, yeah!"
00:20:35.484,00:20:38.153,-Balloon! -The baby with the balloon.
00:20:39.154,00:20:40.906,"Hang on, inventors."
00:20:47.412,00:20:48.497,Eureka!
00:20:48.580,00:20:52.918,We've got all the Baby Silly Faces safe and sound.
00:20:53.252,00:20:54.836,Phewf-a-doof.
00:20:55.170,00:20:56.713,"Great work, inventors."
00:21:01.134,00:21:04.805,Balloon! Balloon! Balloon!
00:21:07.766,00:21:08.767,Plot twist!
00:21:09.434,00:21:11.395,Is this how our story ends?
00:21:13.522,00:21:18.318,Nope. We can't end a story when babies are crying!
00:21:19.278,00:21:21.238,Balloon! Balloon!
00:21:21.697,00:21:23.407,We need more balloons.
00:21:24.283,00:21:28.537,"A Viking hat, spatula, sandwich, light bulb..."
00:21:29.037,00:21:30.622,I've got nothing.
00:21:31.081,00:21:32.833,We need to get more balloons.
00:21:32.916,00:21:34.084,But how?
00:21:36.878,00:21:38.588,The More Machine.
00:21:39.715,00:21:43.260,"Inventors, to the laboratory."
00:22:01.028,00:22:02.571,-Thank you! Balloon! -Thank you!
00:22:02.654,00:22:03.905,Balloon!
00:22:04.781,00:22:12.956,One for you and one for me and one for you-- The end.
00:22:13.832,00:22:15.584,Or is it?
00:22:16.168,00:22:18.295,We still have this More Machine.
00:22:18.628,00:22:21.965,"Storyteller, what do you want to make more of?"
00:22:26.178,00:22:28.930,You've got a story to create!
00:00:12.804,00:00:14.806,"-Giddyup, horsie! -Clomp-a-clomp-clomp-a-clomp!"
00:00:16.266,00:00:19.519,-Whoa-a-doh-doh! -Clomp-a-clomp-a-clomp-a.

00:00:26.818,00:00:29.738,Have you ever ridden on a real horse before?
00:00:32.574,00:00:35.201,I wish I could ride a real horse.
00:00:36.286,00:00:37.412,Ooh!

00:00:47.213,00:00:49.340,In a story!
00:00:50.049,00:00:53.052,Will you create a cowboy and cowgirl story with me?
00:00:54.846,00:00:58.266,OK. I feel...
00:00:58.349,00:01:01.061,a story coming on!

00:01:32.258,00:01:33.968,Let's get this story started.

00:02:13.967,00:02:16.803,And this right here is my horse named Giddyup.
00:02:25.145,00:02:28.189,I'm the best on Old West Color Street.
00:02:45.540,00:02:50.044,I think there can only be one best on Old West Color Street...
00:02:50.128,00:02:52.422,and that's me!
00:02:54.090,00:02:56.175,"No, it's me!"

00:03:20.742,00:03:23.786,Our story is getting sticky!
00:03:23.870,00:03:26.164,"What should we do next, storytellers?"
00:03:26.247,00:03:28.499,How can we show who's the best?
00:03:29.792,00:03:31.669,-The sheriff's coming! -And the other sheriff!
00:03:34.672,00:03:37.842,-I'm the sheriff. -We're co-sheriffs.
00:03:53.942,00:03:56.694,"Aw, rattlesnakes. I just got it."
00:03:56.778,00:03:59.822,Whoever gets our other sheriff hat will be the best...
00:04:03.576,00:04:05.245,That'll be me.

00:04:22.053,00:04:23.596,"Giddyup, Giddyup!"
00:04:35.275,00:04:37.318,Hm. Maybe over here?
00:04:38.528,00:04:39.487,No.
00:04:44.951,00:04:47.120,Oh! Where could that hat be?
00:04:48.413,00:04:51.082,I really want to show I'm the best!
00:04:53.501,00:04:56.129,"The hat! Good work, Giddyup."

00:05:15.565,00:05:17.859,No one take it!
00:05:17.942,00:05:19.527,So hot!
00:05:26.242,00:05:28.286,She won't give it to us.
00:05:31.497,00:05:34.334,Our story's getting stickier!
00:05:41.758,00:05:45.803,"Good idea, Giddyup. Those are cold."
00:05:48.473,00:05:52.226,and make this story even better!
00:05:52.310,00:05:54.854,Let's make a fruit pop truck.
00:05:56.189,00:06:00.068,Ooh! Or an Old West fruit pop truck-wagon!
00:06:00.151,00:06:02.403,Hee hee hee! Color it up!
00:06:07.241,00:06:10.244,Will you make a fruit pop wagon with me?
00:06:12.955,00:06:17.293,Let's shake it up!
00:06:24.884,00:06:26.260,OK.
00:06:26.344,00:06:29.430,What shape can we use for the wagon's wheels?
00:06:32.809,00:06:34.519,How about these circles?
00:06:38.856,00:06:41.484,"Now, what shape can we use for the wagon?"
00:06:47.365,00:06:53.621,"And we need a nice, big window where the Silly Face Bandit can get her fruit pop."
00:07:02.380,00:07:11.180,"And let's add a triangle, so we can clang-clang-clang and let everyone know it's fruit pop time."
00:07:11.264,00:07:14.100,"And, triangle, please?"
00:07:19.439,00:07:25.236,"Let's get back to our story, and get that hat before Cowgirl Weather!"

00:07:59.270,00:08:02.523,Color me green. I'm worried.
00:08:02.607,00:08:06.194,I hope the bandit wants to trade her hat for a fruit pop.
00:08:07.278,00:08:11.282,You look like you could use a cold treat.
00:08:11.365,00:08:17.038,"I'll trade you this nice, cold fruit pop for your nice star hat."
00:08:17.121,00:08:20.208,"One pop, one hat."
00:08:32.011,00:08:33.888,Yee-haw!

00:09:11.968,00:09:13.719,I need something to grab the hat.
00:09:17.431,00:09:22.353,Time to show everyone I'm the best on Old West Color Street.
00:09:36.158,00:09:38.995,My lasso's just floating on top!
00:09:39.078,00:09:41.747,I can't get my hook out far enough!
00:09:43.082,00:09:47.545,Color me purple! I'm frustrated!
00:10:02.310,00:10:05.605,Not if we're the ones telling the story.
00:10:09.483,00:10:15.072,"Cowgirl Weather, I reckon we have to be the best... together."
00:10:15.156,00:10:18.576,"All right, Cowboy. We're goin' hat-fishing!"

00:11:52.753,00:11:53.921,No more.
00:11:54.505,00:11:55.631,Hmm.
00:12:00.678,00:12:02.221,Hey!
00:12:02.304,00:12:05.474,We could invent something in a story!
00:12:06.434,00:12:07.977,You're a storyteller.
00:12:12.690,00:12:15.317,I feel...

00:12:54.607,00:12:56.066,Once upon a time...
00:12:57.651,00:12:59.028,you and I...
00:13:00.404,00:13:03.282,were famous inventors...
00:13:04.200,00:13:07.786,going to work in our top-secret invention laboratory...
00:13:07.870,00:13:10.414,in the back of the Pancake Café.
00:13:10.498,00:13:11.665,Hee hee hee!
00:13:11.999,00:13:14.877,"-Hey, hey, Violet! -Hey, hey, Charlie."
00:13:14.960,00:13:18.339,I just invented a brand-new pancake flavor!
00:13:18.422,00:13:23.594,"Peanut butter, banana, and... fluffy cloud!"

00:17:23.125,00:17:25.377,Whoa! Hee hee hee!
00:17:25.461,00:17:31.091,We need to invent something to collect the babies and keep them safe.
00:17:31.592,00:17:32.801,How about a crib?
00:17:33.677,00:17:36.847,On wheels. That'll go fast.
00:17:36.930,00:17:39.683,Yes! And let's put...

00:18:22.559,00:18:23.685,Yes!
00:18:23.769,00:18:27.856,And these thin rectangles will keep the babies safe inside.
00:18:27.940,00:18:32.778,"Now, how about some fast wheels to catch up with those rolly babies?"
00:18:34.279,00:18:36.490,What shapes can we use for wheels?
00:18:42.496,00:18:45.332,"And last but not least, our scooper."
00:18:45.833,00:18:48.210,Which shape can we use for scooping?
00:18:54.716,00:18:57.845,And... boo-dah-doo!

00:03:44.182,00:03:45.767,How about a giant frying pan?

00:03:56.069,00:03:56.903,Or...
00:03:57.737,00:04:01.324,we could build a super-super-fast pancake machine.

00:04:30.603,00:04:34.649,Let's try this big square.
00:04:36.484,00:04:40.571,"Now, we need a window so we can see the pancakes."

00:05:02.343,00:05:04.387,How about a triangle?
00:05:10.268,00:05:12.186,Make it a little wider.
00:05:13.688,00:05:15.398,That's working okay.
00:05:16.607,00:05:17.483,Yipes!
00:05:17.817,00:05:21.070,We need a long shape for our pancakes to come out on.

00:05:27.452,00:05:29.746,Let's put this rectangle there.

00:10:58.157,00:11:04.288,How about if we go up a humongous hill of pancakes and discover a secret cave?
00:11:04.664,00:11:06.957,What would happen next in that story?

00:14:39.795,00:14:40.629,"Hey, hey!"
00:14:41.839,00:14:44.008,...but I can't move.
00:14:44.174,00:14:46.260,My points don't work that way.
00:14:46.343,00:14:48.304,"Maybe we can help you, Star."
00:14:53.517,00:14:54.351,See?
00:14:54.518,00:14:55.686,Stuck.
00:14:56.395,00:14:57.354,Yuh-oh.
00:14:57.563,00:14:59.857,"Star is stuck, and we want to play."
00:15:00.274,00:15:01.483,This is not good.
00:15:01.567,00:15:03.027,Star can't move.
00:15:04.945,00:15:07.781,Our story is getting sticky.
00:15:07.865,00:15:10.075,What should we do next in our story?
00:15:15.372,00:15:16.624,Idea break!
00:15:17.666,00:15:21.837,Maybe we can create something that will move her around.
00:15:22.588,00:15:24.256,Like a merry-go-round.
00:15:25.799,00:15:30.304,Will you create a merry-go-round with me so we can play with Star?
00:15:33.474,00:15:35.476,Yeah! We can do that!
00:15:35.559,00:15:37.186,This is a story.
00:15:38.228,00:15:42.232,Let's shake it up!
00:15:48.989,00:15:50.074,Okay.
00:15:57.122,00:15:59.500,How about this triangle?
00:16:01.752,00:16:02.795,Yes!
00:16:03.796,00:16:06.715,And now we need something to stand on.
00:16:06.966,00:16:08.509,What can we use?
00:16:12.596,00:16:14.974,Let's try this long rectangle.
00:16:20.104,00:16:22.272,We need something to hold up the top.
00:16:23.023,00:16:24.650,What shape can we use?
00:16:29.738,00:16:32.574,How about this large rectangle?
00:16:35.202,00:16:40.082,Now these thinny-thin rectangles can be the poles to hold on to.
00:16:40.416,00:16:43.043,"And drum roll, please."
00:16:43.335,00:16:47.256,Boo-da-doo!
00:16:47.840,00:16:49.758,Let's go show our friends.
00:16:50.843,00:16:53.303,We've got an up-and-down merry-go-round!
00:16:53.387,00:16:55.806,-Ah-mazing! -Brilliant!
00:16:55.889,00:16:57.016,Let's ride!
00:16:57.391,00:16:59.143,"What would you like to ride on, Star?"
00:16:59.518,00:17:01.729,I'll take this... little dipper.
00:17:01.812,00:17:03.939,"Down here, we call that a spoon."
00:17:04.064,00:17:05.941,Spoon?
00:17:06.442,00:17:07.985,That's a silly word.
00:17:10.779,00:17:12.489,I'm on a lightning bolt.
00:17:12.573,00:17:14.033,I'm on a socket wrench.
00:17:17.703,00:17:19.955,So twinkly-sparkly!
00:17:23.584,00:17:25.794,"-Nice! -Oh, yeah!"
00:17:43.312,00:17:45.981,"Charlie this is so, so fun."
00:17:46.356,00:17:48.734,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:17:49.234,00:17:50.778,Colour me happy!
00:17:50.861,00:17:53.155,'Cause I'm very super-happy!
00:18:07.753,00:18:10.089,It is such fun playing with all of you.
00:18:10.422,00:18:12.174,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:18:12.800,00:18:14.426,What are we gonna do next?
00:18:15.761,00:18:16.887,Star?
00:18:17.054,00:18:20.182,You didn't really sparkle when you twinkled just then.
00:18:21.266,00:18:22.893,Let me try again.
00:18:23.310,00:18:25.270,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:18:26.730,00:18:29.191,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:18:30.442,00:18:32.402,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:18:33.904,00:18:35.989,I'm losing my sparkle!
00:18:38.534,00:18:40.786,Our story is getting stickier.
00:18:41.286,00:18:42.871,How can we get it back?
00:18:42.955,00:18:45.749,The only way to get my sparkle back is to...
00:18:49.419,00:18:51.338,But we just started playing.
00:18:51.713,00:18:55.092,I don't want to... leave you all either.
00:19:01.974,00:19:04.393,What should we do next in our story?
00:19:04.768,00:19:10.649,"We need to get Star home, but... how can we get Star to space?"
00:19:15.320,00:19:16.572,A rocket ship!
00:19:16.864,00:19:19.950,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:19:20.284,00:19:23.287,Let's get creative and make our story even better.
00:19:23.662,00:19:27.708,Let's turn our merry-go-round into a rocket ship!
00:19:27.791,00:19:31.211,Let's break it up!
00:19:33.463,00:19:36.508,This rectangle can be the body of the rocket.
00:19:37.050,00:19:38.927,What can we use for windows?
00:19:40.345,00:19:43.307,How about the small circles?
00:19:43.724,00:19:45.559,What can we use for a top?
00:19:48.020,00:19:50.147,The big triangle.
00:19:51.273,00:19:52.983,And now some legs...
00:19:53.525,00:19:55.110,and a door.
00:19:55.736,00:19:58.530,"And drum roll, please."
00:19:59.364,00:20:00.574,Boo-da-doo!
00:20:03.243,00:20:05.370,Let's rocket back to our story.
00:20:07.039,00:20:08.916,Ah-mazing!
00:20:09.166,00:20:10.500,Stick with us!
00:20:11.752,00:20:16.632,"Five, four, three, two, one."
00:20:16.840,00:20:18.926,Blast off!
00:20:25.265,00:20:27.017,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:20:29.645,00:20:31.313,Look at all the stars.
00:20:31.563,00:20:33.941,So twinkly-sparkly.
00:20:49.331,00:20:50.916,There's Star's family.
00:20:51.416,00:20:52.751,-Hi! -Hi!
00:20:58.006,00:21:00.008,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:21:02.636,00:21:04.763,It feels good to sparkle again.
00:21:05.973,00:21:08.267,"Thanks for bringing me home, friends."
00:21:08.600,00:21:10.185,Twinkle me sparkly!
00:21:10.978,00:21:12.020,Ah-mazing!
00:21:12.271,00:21:13.939,What are we gonna do next?
00:21:15.524,00:21:17.192,"Don't yawn, don't yawn."
00:21:20.362,00:21:22.531,"-Oh, no! -My stars!"
00:21:22.864,00:21:25.158,What is happening to your faces?
00:21:26.785,00:21:27.911,We're yawning.
00:21:28.245,00:21:29.371,We're tired.
00:21:29.955,00:21:32.332,Now we're the ones who need to go home.
00:21:34.835,00:21:36.795,Is this how our story ends?
00:21:37.546,00:21:40.340,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:21:40.674,00:21:42.926,It's time for something big to happen.
00:21:43.510,00:21:44.845,I think we need to...
00:21:47.180,00:21:49.516,I think we need to go home.
00:21:50.517,00:21:51.893,"Good night, Star."
00:21:52.477,00:21:53.687,"Good night, Charlie."
00:21:55.439,00:21:56.898,I'll see you soon.
00:21:57.357,00:21:58.442,Very soon.
00:21:58.734,00:21:59.609,See?
00:22:06.783,00:22:07.909,-I saw it first. -I saw it first.
00:22:07.993,00:22:09.161,"-No, me. -No, me."
00:22:09.328,00:22:10.537,"-No, me! -No, me!"
00:22:12.873,00:22:14.333,The end.
00:22:14.791,00:22:16.084,Or is it?
00:22:16.293,00:22:20.505,What if you came to space to play with Star?
00:22:22.299,00:22:24.593,What do you think would happen next?
00:22:26.511,00:22:29.014,You've got a story to create!
00:22:47.115,00:22:48.742,Hot sand. Yikes!
00:00:15.682,00:00:18.309,Hi! I'm Charlie!
00:00:32.157,00:00:34.617,What should our story be about?
00:00:36.661,00:00:38.413,I'm thinking...
00:00:48.339,00:00:49.591,Yum!
00:00:54.471,00:00:56.014,Pancakes!
00:01:00.185,00:01:06.066,I feel a story coming on!
00:01:06.733,00:01:08.443,Let's get this story started!
00:01:41.309,00:01:49.609,"Once upon a time, you and I were in my kitchen about to make the best pancake ever!"
00:01:52.612,00:01:54.989,What should we use to make pancakes?
00:01:55.073,00:01:56.366,Hmm.
00:01:57.033,00:01:58.910,Circles it is!
00:01:59.202,00:02:01.788,It's going to be Pancake City in here.
00:02:19.222,00:02:21.182,Pancake!
00:02:22.767,00:02:23.893,Yes!
00:02:28.565,00:02:29.816,Who do you think it is?
00:02:31.484,00:02:33.820,Do you think they want my pancake?
00:02:36.531,00:02:38.992,"-Hey, hey, Charlie! -Hey, hey!"
00:02:39.075,00:02:44.789,"More characters for our story. My best friends, Violet and Red."
00:02:44.873,00:02:47.792,Mmm. I knew I smelled pancakes!
00:02:47.876,00:02:49.335,Is this for me?
00:02:54.382,00:02:56.676,You should be a chef!
00:02:57.218,00:02:59.762,"Yeah, because we're gonna need more pancakes."
00:03:02.181,00:03:04.017,"I mean, she already had one."
00:03:04.100,00:03:06.519,And don't forget a pancake for me!
00:03:10.690,00:03:12.066,Again?
00:03:17.614,00:03:19.032,A Silly Face!
00:03:19.115,00:03:21.826,One Silly Face can eat a lot of pancakes.
00:03:23.244,00:03:25.914,"-Pancake, pancake, pancake. -This is a lot of Silly Faces."
00:03:25.997,00:03:29.834,And a lot of Silly Faces can eat a lot of pancakes.
00:03:29.918,00:03:32.921,Our story's getting sticky.
00:03:33.129,00:03:35.673,How am I going to make enough pancakes for everyone?
00:03:37.133,00:03:38.885,-Including me? -...good!
00:03:40.511,00:03:42.138,Let's make something!
00:03:42.430,00:03:44.057,What can we make?
00:03:44.140,00:03:45.934,How about a giant frying pan?
00:03:49.562,00:03:52.982,-Or... -A chicken that lays pancakes?
00:03:56.027,00:03:57.320,Or...
00:03:57.695,00:04:01.449,we could build a super-super-fast pancake machine.
00:04:01.699,00:04:04.160,That would make so many pancakes.
00:04:04.911,00:04:07.622,Let's build a pancake machine!
00:04:07.705,00:04:12.043,Let's sha-aa-ke it up!
00:04:21.886,00:04:24.847,So we need something big. Like an oven.
00:04:25.056,00:04:27.267,What shape can we use?
00:04:36.442,00:04:40.989,"Now, we need a window. So we can see the pancakes."
00:04:42.740,00:04:44.993,What shape could we use?
00:04:51.374,00:04:54.043,"Yipes, that's not big enough!"
00:04:55.795,00:04:57.547,Now it's one big window!
00:04:57.880,00:05:02.218,"Okay, now we need to get the circles inside."
00:05:02.302,00:05:04.846,How about a triangle?
00:05:10.268,00:05:12.603,Make it a little wider.
00:05:13.646,00:05:15.356,That's working okay.
00:05:17.775,00:05:21.029,We need a long shape for our pancakes to come out on.
00:05:22.238,00:05:24.282,What shape could we use?
00:05:27.410,00:05:29.662,Let's put this rectangle there.
00:05:33.416,00:05:34.834,Fantastic!
00:05:35.084,00:05:38.838,Ooh-da-doo!
00:05:39.422,00:05:43.301,Pancake machine is ready.
00:05:43.384,00:05:46.971,Now back to our story! Let's go make a lot of pancakes.
00:05:47.680,00:05:48.848,Pancake machine!
00:05:55.146,00:05:57.148,"Brilliant, Charlie!"
00:06:05.198,00:06:08.493,"Tickle me pink, I'm so excited!"
00:06:08.576,00:06:11.746,Let's make the story even better.
00:06:21.798,00:06:24.300,I just need my chef hat.
00:06:46.781,00:06:48.366,Oops! After you!
00:06:48.449,00:06:49.992,-For me? -Ooh!

00:07:10.638,00:07:13.266,-We don't have any more circles! -Nope.
00:07:18.354,00:07:22.692,No more circles means... no more pancakes!
00:07:23.109,00:07:25.570,Our story's getting stickier.
00:07:26.112,00:07:27.405,We need more circles.
00:07:30.825,00:07:32.827,all over Colorforms City.
00:07:35.246,00:07:37.623,Hmm. Hmm...
00:07:42.712,00:07:45.298,-The tops of these stools! -Whoo!
00:07:52.555,00:07:54.932,-We can use those! -Da-da da!
00:08:05.610,00:08:07.528,Let's make some pancakes!
00:08:07.612,00:08:10.990,"Okay. We need two for Violet, that Silly Face wants three..."
00:08:19.332,00:08:20.666,Mmm! Mmm.
00:08:24.712,00:08:27.715,"I hope, hope, hope..."
00:08:45.024,00:08:48.611,How will I ever get a pancake now?
00:09:00.414,00:09:03.000,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:04.710,00:09:07.964,Not if we are the ones telling the story.
00:09:22.562,00:09:25.815,"-Hi, Miss Weather! Can you make it rain--? -Yes!"
00:09:40.371,00:09:43.332,I could try.

00:10:31.130,00:10:34.091,"-Thanks, Miss Weather! -Thank you!"
00:10:37.428,00:10:41.349,Finally! I can eat my pancake.
00:10:41.974,00:10:43.184,Ooh!
00:10:50.274,00:10:52.151,Color me happy!
00:10:56.864,00:10:57.990,Or is it?
00:10:58.157,00:11:04.580,How about if we go up a humongous hill of pancakes and discover a secret cave?
00:11:27.395,00:11:28.437,Ooh!
00:11:29.855,00:11:30.731,Hi!
00:11:31.482,00:11:34.485,I'm looking at the stars.

00:11:52.837,00:11:54.755,I wish we could be friends with them.
00:11:56.841,00:12:02.054,Hey. We could be friends with a star in a story.
00:12:02.555,00:12:05.182,Will you create a star story with me...
00:12:05.266,00:12:07.184,where we play with a star?

00:14:56.353,00:15:00.149,Uh-oh. Star is stuck and we want to play.
00:15:00.274,00:15:03.402,This is not good. Star can't move.
00:15:48.989,00:15:50.449,Okay.

00:04:08.873,00:04:09.958,But who?
00:04:10.583,00:04:12.627,How about Chicken?

00:04:54.711,00:04:57.505,Here's a rectangle for the body.
00:04:57.922,00:05:00.466,"Now, how about the head?"
00:05:01.217,00:05:03.594,What shape could we use for the head?
00:05:06.389,00:05:09.642,How about this big square?
00:05:11.686,00:05:18.109,"And instead of legs, let's have our robot roll around fast, fast, fast to help us."
00:05:19.027,00:05:20.778,Which shape rolls around?
00:05:23.531,00:05:24.866,The circle!
00:05:25.116,00:05:27.243,And colour up!
00:05:27.327,00:05:31.497,Let's get creative and make this story even better.
00:05:32.707,00:05:35.543,"One arm can be a spanner, like this..."
00:05:36.210,00:05:38.254,"so it can fix, fix, fix!"
00:05:38.629,00:05:40.548,And the other arm could be...
00:05:45.053,00:05:46.804,"No, that won't work."
00:05:47.013,00:05:48.723,Let's try this screwdriver.
00:05:49.432,00:05:54.437,And boo-da-doo!
00:05:55.521,00:05:57.106,Just turn it on.
00:06:04.280,00:06:08.451,"It beeps, it boops, it fixes cars."
00:06:08.868,00:06:11.162,It's a robot!
00:06:11.245,00:06:12.372,Yes!
00:06:12.455,00:06:15.124,We can fix everyone's cars and trucks now.
00:06:16.209,00:06:19.587,"All right, mechanics, and robot..."
00:06:20.129,00:06:22.590,-Vio-let's fix it! -Fix it!
00:06:53.538,00:06:54.956,"Robot, what?"
00:07:00.837,00:07:05.383,"Robot, we're trying to make our customers smile, not make the taxi smile."
00:07:07.552,00:07:08.970,Where are my doors?
00:07:10.555,00:07:12.598,Why is my taxi smiling?
00:07:13.474,00:07:16.519,I need a tyre. My meeting!
00:07:17.228,00:07:18.146,Oh-oh!
00:07:18.396,00:07:20.731,The cars are more broken than before.
00:07:22.442,00:07:24.986,And our customers are not happy.
00:07:25.361,00:07:28.573,"The robot is fast, but nothing is fixed."
00:07:31.576,00:07:33.578,-What is happening? -My meeting!
00:07:33.661,00:07:36.080,I am frowning now.
00:07:36.414,00:07:39.000,Don't worry. It's our fix-it shop.
00:07:39.083,00:07:41.294,We will fix everything.
00:07:41.711,00:07:44.755,"Ourselves, without the robot."
00:07:45.089,00:07:48.676,"Okay, mechanics, just got to turn the robot off."
00:07:49.010,00:07:50.678,Where is the robot?
00:07:54.682,00:07:56.517,"Robot, come back here!"
00:07:56.767,00:07:58.227,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:08:01.772,00:08:03.149,Colour me green.
00:08:03.608,00:08:04.734,I'm worried.
00:08:04.901,00:08:07.695,We really can't fix anything now.
00:08:08.029,00:08:10.323,Our story is getting stickier.
00:08:13.284,00:08:15.453,"What should we do next, storyteller?"
00:08:17.663,00:08:21.042,We need to go after that robot and get our tools.
00:08:22.668,00:08:23.920,Stick with us.
00:08:27.381,00:08:29.634,Vio-let's get that robot!
00:08:31.177,00:08:32.887,"Oh, great!"
00:08:32.970,00:08:34.096,That way!
00:08:49.695,00:08:50.780,The robot!
00:08:51.697,00:08:53.241,And all of our tools!
00:08:53.574,00:08:55.368,How are we gonna get them back?
00:08:55.618,00:08:56.953,-I've got an idea. -I've got an idea.
00:08:58.287,00:08:59.205,-Yeah. -Yeah.
00:08:59.664,00:09:00.706,"Yeah, that'll work."
00:09:00.957,00:09:02.333,"Okay, that's perfect."
00:09:03.417,00:09:04.377,And break!
00:09:07.129,00:09:08.130,"Hey, robot!"
00:09:09.632,00:09:11.425,Can you fix this car?
00:09:16.889,00:09:19.892,Just got to turn this robot off.
00:09:23.604,00:09:24.522,Catch!
00:09:26.524,00:09:28.317,Phewf-a-doof.
00:09:29.068,00:09:32.655,"The robot is off, and we have our tools back."
00:09:32.947,00:09:34.991,We're going back to the fix-it shop.
00:09:35.908,00:09:38.119,Let's go make our customers happy!
00:09:43.958,00:09:48.296,I think we might have even more customers than before.
00:09:49.046,00:09:50.339,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:09:50.423,00:09:52.508,We've got so many customers.
00:09:53.384,00:09:54.552,Hello?
00:09:54.885,00:09:57.597,I had to do my meeting on the phone!
00:09:58.139,00:10:01.017,My taxi is frowning now.
00:10:07.481,00:10:10.651,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:10:10.735,00:10:13.446,It's time for something big to happen.
00:10:13.738,00:10:21.746,"Mechanics, it's a lot of customers, but we just need to take our time, do it together, and fix it! -Fix it!"
00:10:23.331,00:10:28.711,"And while you wait, please enjoy some delicious pancakes from our new and improved robot."
00:10:28.919,00:10:30.921,Just push this button.

00:10:50.024,00:10:51.317,Phewf-a-doof.
00:10:51.567,00:10:57.490,"Our customers are happy again, and we are fixing these cars ourselves."
00:10:58.074,00:10:59.575,"Keep it up, mechanics."
00:11:01.577,00:11:02.995,Or is it?
00:11:03.162,00:11:06.332,What is another kind of robot story we can make?
00:11:10.211,00:11:13.172,You've got a story to create!
00:11:24.558,00:11:25.685,Stick with me.

00:11:44.537,00:11:46.706,Have you ever been on a boat?
00:11:58.467,00:12:01.846,I wish I could sail on a really big boat.
00:12:02.638,00:12:05.808,Do you know where we could sail on a really big boat?
00:12:06.267,00:12:07.518,In a story!
00:12:08.185,00:12:10.813,We could be... pirates!
00:12:12.857,00:12:16.444,"Hey, storyteller, will you create a pirate story with me?"
00:12:18.404,00:12:19.238,Great!

00:13:27.640,00:13:29.767,Pancake Island.
00:13:30.017,00:13:33.270,They say it's shaped like a pancake.
00:13:33.521,00:13:38.400,With a volcano of syrup and blueberries the size of houses.
00:13:38.484,00:13:40.528,-That's a big blueberry. -But...
00:13:40.611,00:13:42.905,no pirate has ever found it...
00:13:43.531,00:13:45.074,until us.
00:13:48.828,00:13:50.037,Tickle me pink.
00:13:50.287,00:13:51.956,I'm so excited!
00:13:54.834,00:13:58.170,I really hope it looks just like a pancake.
00:13:58.295,00:14:02.383,"Pirates, hoist the anchor, and away we sail."
00:14:07.012,00:14:21.235,"Yar-yo-ho, off we go Pancake Island, here we come Yar-yo-ho, off we go Pancake Island, yum-a-dum-dum Ahoy, pirates."

00:14:31.036,00:14:32.663,Pirate report!
00:14:33.080,00:14:37.877,"We are here, and Pancake Island is somewhere over there."
00:14:38.085,00:14:41.171,"I haven't found it yet, but I will soon."
00:14:41.714,00:14:44.133,I can feel it in me bones...
00:14:44.800,00:14:46.343,like the weather.
00:14:50.598,00:14:52.141,See you there!

00:15:11.827,00:15:12.745,We stopped.
00:15:12.828,00:15:14.371,Is something in our way?
00:15:14.455,00:15:16.081,It looks clear to me.
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.917,I can't see anything.
00:15:18.292,00:15:19.293,Nothing's here.
00:15:21.545,00:15:22.963,I think I heard something.
00:15:26.634,00:15:28.093,Must have been the wind.
00:15:29.011,00:15:30.554,Our sails are missing.
00:15:30.930,00:15:34.308,That's why we stopped. We can't move without sails.
00:15:34.725,00:15:36.352,Colour me argh!
00:15:36.644,00:15:37.853,I'm worried.
00:15:38.437,00:15:42.191,"Without our sails, we can't get to Pancake Island."
00:15:45.110,00:15:47.279,Our story is getting sticky.
00:15:47.613,00:15:49.073,What happens next?
00:15:49.365,00:15:52.326,"How can we get to Pancake Island, storytellers?"
00:15:55.120,00:15:57.456,"We could row, row, row the boat."
00:15:57.665,00:15:58.499,With what?
00:15:58.791,00:16:00.918,"Grab a toothbrush, me mateys."
00:16:01.210,00:16:04.171,"-I just got a new set. -Yes, yes, yes!"
00:16:04.588,00:16:06.674,Just a little sticky...
00:16:07.633,00:16:09.385,-All right. -Brilliant.
00:16:11.011,00:16:12.012,Let's row.
00:16:12.554,00:16:13.639,We need your help.
00:16:18.686,00:16:29.488,"Yar-yo-ho, off we row Pancake Island, here we-- This is very, very hard."
00:16:30.572,00:16:31.615,Ahoy!
00:16:35.369,00:16:39.456,"Our sails are gone, and we're not going anywhere with our rowing."
00:16:42.334,00:16:43.168,-Wha...? -What?
00:16:43.335,00:16:44.837,Lightning and thunder!
00:16:45.004,00:16:46.463,Me motor's gone.
00:16:49.842,00:16:52.302,None of us can get to Pancake Island now.
00:16:54.680,00:16:56.932,Our story is getting stickier.
00:16:57.474,00:16:59.643,"What should we do next, storyteller?"
00:17:05.649,00:17:08.318,Is that landlubber giggling I hear?
00:17:08.777,00:17:09.611,-Who's there? -What?
00:17:09.820,00:17:11.780,-Hello? -Hello?
00:17:12.614,00:17:13.949,Do you see someone?
00:17:16.201,00:17:17.244,De-do!
00:17:17.619,00:17:18.579,What?!
00:17:19.246,00:17:21.165,Baby Silly Faces?
00:17:21.457,00:17:22.458,Plot twist!
00:17:23.792,00:17:25.335,Babies make boat....
00:17:26.128,00:17:27.504,sail.
00:17:28.964,00:17:31.759,"Babies, those are our sails."
00:17:32.134,00:17:33.093,Motor.
00:17:37.931,00:17:39.850,That's my motor.
00:17:40.642,00:17:41.477,Yours?
00:17:41.852,00:17:42.686,Not mine?
00:17:46.065,00:17:48.192,"Sorry, we babies."
00:17:49.818,00:17:51.236,We give back now.
00:17:55.783,00:17:57.659,-De-do! -De-do!
00:17:59.703,00:18:01.205,"Thank you, babies."
00:18:12.508,00:18:17.262,We babies want to go Pancake Island!
00:18:19.264,00:18:22.810,"Yuh-oh, the babies want to go to Pancake Island, too."
00:18:23.143,00:18:24.895,But their boat is broken.
00:18:27.815,00:18:29.942,We love blueberries.
00:18:31.151,00:18:33.028,Is this how our story ends?
00:18:34.905,00:18:37.991,Not if we are the ones telling the story.
00:18:38.283,00:18:40.202,"What do you think, storyteller?"
00:18:40.410,00:18:43.413,"Should we help the babies get to Pancake Island, too?"
00:18:46.875,00:18:48.377,"Aye aye, pirates."
00:19:02.099,00:19:04.852,Let's get this ship in ship-shape.
00:19:05.060,00:19:07.646,Let's push these masts up straight.
00:19:07.813,00:19:09.022,Wind!
00:19:12.776,00:19:17.739,And this cutie-woodie baby boat needs a cutie-woodie baby bottle.
00:19:19.283,00:19:20.784,I like it!
00:19:21.201,00:19:24.454,"Now for some sails, so that the boat can move."
00:19:25.497,00:19:26.415,-De-do? -De-do?
00:19:26.874,00:19:28.000,Yeh-hess!
00:19:31.003,00:19:32.546,And stick.
00:19:34.923,00:19:35.799,Ahoy!
00:19:39.344,00:19:40.888,It's moving!
00:19:41.305,00:19:42.931,In the wrong direction.
00:19:45.642,00:19:48.979,Rain and sleet! Turn the ship around.
00:19:49.521,00:19:52.441,Yuh-oh! This steering wheel is broken.
00:19:52.691,00:19:56.820,We need a new steering wheel so we can go the right way.
00:19:57.237,00:19:59.323,Will you help me make a steering wheel?
00:20:01.575,00:20:05.579,Let's shake it up!
00:20:12.085,00:20:12.920,Okay.
00:20:13.503,00:20:16.340,What shape should we use for the steering wheel?
00:20:19.635,00:20:21.470,This big circle will work.
00:20:26.225,00:20:29.061,And a pirate ship steering wheel needs handles.
00:20:30.896,00:20:34.149,What shape do you think we should use for the handles?
00:20:42.115,00:20:47.079,"There. Oh, and let's get creative and make this story even better."
00:20:47.412,00:20:51.375,Let's make it a steering wheel they can ride on!
00:20:56.046,00:20:57.631,Boo-da-dargh!
00:20:59.800,00:21:01.385,I like it!
00:21:01.551,00:21:05.764,"Now, let's get all of us pirates to Pancake Island."
00:21:07.933,00:21:09.851,"Ahoy, Silly Babies."
00:21:12.521,00:21:13.397,-Thank you! -Thank you!
00:21:13.480,00:21:15.148,-Thank you! -Thank you!
00:21:16.316,00:21:21.321,"All right, pirates, let's go find Pancake Island!"
00:21:21.947,00:21:23.490,De-do!
00:21:23.573,00:21:37.879,"Yar-yo-ho, off we go Pancake Island, here we come Yar-yo-ho, off we go Pancake Island, yum-a-dum-dum Shiver me timbers!"
00:21:37.963,00:21:39.756,It's Pancake Island.
00:21:39.840,00:21:41.466,-Ah-mazing. -Brilliant.
00:21:41.550,00:21:42.384,Yes!
00:21:44.344,00:21:45.679,And here comes...
00:21:48.724,00:21:50.267,the syrup...

00:05:38.629,00:05:42.008,And the other arm could be... a rubber ducky?
00:05:49.432,00:05:54.020,And boo... dah... doo!

00:07:25.319,00:07:28.448,"The robot is fast, but nothing is fixed."
00:07:34.495,00:07:36.289,I am frowning now.
00:07:36.372,00:07:41.669,"Don't worry. It's our Fix-It Shop, we will fix everything."

00:13:38.400,00:13:39.568,That's a big blueberry.

00:15:38.270,00:15:42.399,"Without our sails, we can't get to Pancake Island."
00:15:44.985,00:15:49.239,Our story's getting sticky! What happens next?
00:15:49.323,00:15:52.242,"How can we get to Pancake Island, storytellers?"
00:15:55.245,00:15:57.539,"We could row, row, row, the boat."

00:16:25.442,00:16:29.405,"This is very, very hard."
00:16:32.366,00:16:35.202,"What seems to be the trouble, mateys?"
00:16:35.285,00:16:39.206,"Our sails are gone, and we're not going anywhere with our rowing."
00:16:43.252,00:16:46.755,Lightning and thunder! Me motor's gone!
00:16:49.842,00:16:52.344,None of us can get to Pancake Island now.

00:02:03.456,00:02:06.918,A Baby Silly Face driving a car!
00:02:07.585,00:02:08.628,I winning!
00:02:09.587,00:02:13.591,"And now, Miss Weather with the race report."
00:02:13.967,00:02:21.266,"Race report! It's a sunny day today in Colorforms City, with a 100-percent chance of racing!"
00:02:30.984,00:02:32.402,Yeah!
00:02:32.902,00:02:33.987,Hooray!
00:02:34.571,00:02:41.536,"Thanks, Miss Weather. And whoever gets to the top of Birthday Cake Mountain first gets a..."
00:02:42.579,00:02:44.372,golden circle.
00:02:44.914,00:02:46.791,Ah-mazing.
00:02:49.836,00:02:51.838,You can take any path you want.
00:02:52.213,00:02:55.466,As long as you get to the top of the mountain.
00:02:56.009,00:02:57.343,Racers...
00:03:00.555,00:03:01.681,get set...
00:03:02.473,00:03:04.100,-go! -Yeah!
00:03:05.768,00:03:07.145,I winning!
00:03:07.896,00:03:11.357,Yuh-oh. That is one fast Silly Face Baby.
00:03:11.441,00:03:12.650,We've got to catch up.
00:03:18.781,00:03:20.241,She's going the wrong way.
00:03:27.248,00:03:28.625,"Stick with it, Red."
00:03:28.791,00:03:29.876,Phew!
00:03:29.959,00:03:32.420,Are we in the lead now? Is it us?
00:03:33.630,00:03:34.464,"Hi, Charlie!"
00:03:35.340,00:03:36.633,"Bye, Charlie."
00:03:36.716,00:03:40.011,You said we could take any path we want.
00:03:40.303,00:03:41.471,What?
00:03:41.554,00:03:46.351,That tunnel goes right to Birthdayville. They're going to get there before me.
00:03:48.019,00:03:49.270,I winning.
00:03:49.646,00:03:51.105,Zoom-zoom!
00:03:51.439,00:03:54.817,Double yoinks! And now that baby passed us!
00:03:56.569,00:03:57.779,"Oh, phewf."
00:03:58.112,00:03:59.405,She's stopping.
00:04:00.031,00:04:02.242,"-All right, quick. Let's go. -Oh, yeah."
00:04:03.451,00:04:04.535,Looking good.
00:04:05.370,00:04:06.204,Bye-bye!
00:04:10.458,00:04:12.794,We're last in the race.
00:04:15.255,00:04:18.132,Our story is getting sticky.
00:04:18.508,00:04:21.719,"Storyteller, what do you think we should do next?"
00:04:24.055,00:04:26.140,I think we need to go faster.
00:04:27.684,00:04:29.686,Idea break!
00:04:31.562,00:04:33.481,How about we add wheels?
00:04:35.149,00:04:35.984,Nope.
00:04:36.526,00:04:38.027,Too wobbly.
00:04:38.653,00:04:41.698,How about a fast-fast rocket engine?
00:04:42.949,00:04:45.535,"Whoa, that's too fast!"
00:04:47.537,00:04:50.206,What if... we add wings?
00:04:51.249,00:04:52.292,That will work.
00:04:52.500,00:04:54.544,Then we can bounce even higher.
00:04:59.924,00:05:03.845,Let's shake it up!
00:05:12.687,00:05:13.521,Okay.
00:05:13.855,00:05:17.442,What shape can we use to make huge wings?
00:05:20.570,00:05:22.739,This triangle is a nice big wing.
00:05:27.160,00:05:30.079,But what shape can we use for the other wing?
00:05:33.249,00:05:35.251,We could try this triangle.
00:05:37.962,00:05:39.964,I don't think that's going to fly.
00:05:41.549,00:05:43.176,We need to fill it in.
00:05:44.761,00:05:47.638,Let's use this small triangle.
00:05:48.431,00:05:49.807,It's like a puzzle.
00:05:54.354,00:05:55.980,How about this triangle?
00:05:58.649,00:06:01.152,What shape can we use to finish our wing?
00:06:04.364,00:06:06.949,"Oh, I think I know. The square."
00:06:07.825,00:06:12.121,Boo-da-doo!
00:06:12.580,00:06:13.956,I like it!
00:06:14.332,00:06:16.542,Our story is shaping up.
00:06:20.797,00:06:25.051,We're bouncing so fast and so high!
00:06:27.512,00:06:31.974,And now we're in Birthdayville. We're catching up!
00:06:32.433,00:06:33.559,Race report!
00:06:33.643,00:06:37.313,"Charlie's still last in the race, but he's bouncing fast."
00:06:38.189,00:06:42.652,"Violet and Red are just in front of Charlie, and Baby is in the lead."
00:06:44.070,00:06:46.030,But she just got stuck.
00:06:47.240,00:06:48.408,Hello!
00:06:55.540,00:06:56.833,Thank you.
00:06:57.125,00:06:59.001,Keep moving those plungers.
00:07:02.004,00:07:04.173,And now we're passing Baby.
00:07:04.882,00:07:07.343,"-Hi, silly. -Hey, hey!"
00:07:08.094,00:07:10.221,Hey! Gotta go.
00:07:19.605,00:07:21.023,Zoom!
00:07:21.107,00:07:24.527,Violet and Red and Baby are in the lead again.
00:07:24.861,00:07:27.655,"I'm in last place, again."
00:07:30.366,00:07:33.077,Our story is getting stickier.
00:07:33.327,00:07:36.164,And I'm actually stuck.
00:07:38.124,00:07:41.002,Colour me green. I'm worried.
00:07:41.169,00:07:44.714,Who can get me out of this cloud and back to the race?
00:07:47.675,00:07:49.677,I know just the character to call.
00:07:50.386,00:07:53.055,Miss Weather!
00:07:53.973,00:07:57.059,"-Hey, Charlie. -I need to catch up in this race."
00:07:57.143,00:07:58.769,Can you get me out of this cloud?
00:08:02.565,00:08:04.233,I'll try.
00:08:05.902,00:08:08.613,Big race wind!
00:08:10.198,00:08:12.325,"Thank you, Miss Weather!"
00:08:16.245,00:08:17.955,Colour me happy!
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.795,I can just bounce up the layers.
00:08:27.256,00:08:28.216,"Hey, hey, Charlie."
00:08:33.012,00:08:34.597,"-Oh, no! -Oh, no!"
00:08:35.473,00:08:37.058,What do we do now?
00:08:38.351,00:08:39.560,"Oh, no!"
00:08:44.190,00:08:48.986,"They'll never finish the race, and I guess we'll win."
00:08:51.447,00:08:53.699,Is this how our story ends?
00:08:56.202,00:09:01.832,"No! If Violet and Red are out of the race, I don't want to win."
00:09:02.917,00:09:05.211,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:05.670,00:09:08.422,Stick with me.
00:09:10.883,00:09:12.718,"Violet, Red, are you okay?"
00:09:13.010,00:09:14.804,"Charlie, you came back."
00:09:15.054,00:09:16.180,We're okay.
00:09:16.430,00:09:19.058,Our car... not so much.
00:09:19.392,00:09:23.354,A race isn't a race without my two best friends.
00:09:23.563,00:09:24.397,Hop on.
00:09:25.565,00:09:27.858,"-Just move to the left. -Hold on, I almost have it."
00:09:28.109,00:09:29.443,Dangle off the foot.
00:09:30.194,00:09:31.612,-Almost got it. -Put that there.
00:09:32.488,00:09:33.864,Winning! Beep-beep!
00:09:36.158,00:09:38.494,Now we're all out of the race.
00:09:38.786,00:09:41.789,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:09:43.249,00:09:47.420,How about we create something that can carry all of us to the finish line?
00:09:48.879,00:09:50.172,We could use this basket.
00:09:50.256,00:09:52.341,And add a balloon...
00:09:53.050,00:09:54.302,for floatiness.
00:09:56.304,00:09:57.680,Friend-tastic!
00:10:03.603,00:10:07.940,"Okay, who wants to ride in our brand-new flying bouncing balloon?"
00:10:08.065,00:10:09.859,Vio-let's get going.
00:10:13.446,00:10:15.323,Let's go win this race.
00:10:19.535,00:10:21.954,-We're almost there. -And I don't see Baby.
00:10:22.455,00:10:24.415,We are going to...
00:10:26.917,00:10:27.752,What?
00:10:27.835,00:10:29.795,That baby came out of nowhere.
00:10:30.796,00:10:34.050,"In first place, the baby!"
00:10:34.675,00:10:35.593,I win!
00:10:38.220,00:10:40.681,"And in second place, us."
00:10:43.017,00:10:44.560,We're second!
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.439,-Yeah! -Let's go!
00:10:51.651,00:10:52.902,The end.
00:10:56.113,00:11:04.705,"How about we race the baby again in Upside-Down-Land, where everything is..."
00:11:06.207,00:11:07.583,upside down?
00:11:08.000,00:11:10.544,What do you think would happen next?
00:11:12.338,00:11:15.508,You've got a story to create!
00:11:19.970,00:11:21.972,That was a great story!
00:11:24.558,00:11:25.810,Stick with me.
00:11:30.147,00:11:32.400,"Come on, you can do it, Charlie."
00:11:32.775,00:11:35.152,You are brave. You are brave.
00:11:37.988,00:11:39.657,"Whoa, not brave enough yet."
00:11:40.324,00:11:41.409,Hey!
00:11:41.784,00:11:43.953,Do you know where we could be really brave?
00:11:44.453,00:11:45.496,In a story!
00:11:48.249,00:11:51.043,What kind of character is really brave?
00:11:53.170,00:11:56.090,I know. We could be brave knights!
00:11:57.007,00:11:59.927,Will you create a brave knight story with me?
00:12:08.436,00:12:09.937,Let's get this story started!
00:12:10.020,00:12:14.567,Charlie's Colorforms City Yeah -Say hey -Hey!
00:12:14.650,00:12:15.735,-Say hey -Hey!

00:12:27.663,00:12:29.290,Let's give that plot a twist!
00:12:29.373,00:12:40.801,Charlie's Colorforms City Yeah Let's make something great We've got a brand-new story to create Let's get this story started.
00:12:40.885,00:12:44.388,"EPISODE TITLE Once upon a time, you and I..."
00:12:48.768,00:12:50.811,were in Colorforms City.

00:13:00.488,00:13:02.656,-When suddenly... -Help!

00:13:10.664,00:13:12.208,"Hey, hey, Violet and Red."
00:13:12.291,00:13:14.251,How can I knightly help?
00:13:14.543,00:13:16.295,"It's your hot air balloon, Charlie."
00:13:17.546,00:13:18.672,What?
00:13:18.964,00:13:20.424,My hot air balloon?

00:13:25.387,00:13:29.350,We brave knights will save the hot air balloon.
00:13:31.268,00:13:36.899,-You are now Red the Knight. -And I'm Violet the Knight.
00:13:37.233,00:13:38.150,Yes.
00:13:41.195,00:13:42.071,Halt.
00:13:43.697,00:13:46.909,And brave knights need silly squires.
00:13:47.409,00:13:49.912,-Squires! -Hello.
00:13:50.579,00:13:53.207,Look at me! I got mine.
00:13:57.545,00:14:03.551,"Okay, brave knights... and silly squires, we're off to save the balloon."
00:14:04.844,00:14:06.762,I wonder who took it.
00:14:08.305,00:14:13.519,"This is a knight story, so maybe it will be a dragon!"
00:14:21.151,00:14:22.111,Dragons?
00:14:26.282,00:14:27.658,Do you see it?
00:14:29.869,00:14:30.744,Charlie?
00:14:30.870,00:14:32.538,The balloon is yonder.
00:14:33.205,00:14:34.623,That means over there.
00:14:36.208,00:14:38.168,"Knights, to the balloon!"
00:14:38.627,00:14:40.212,-Yeah! -Yonder!
00:14:46.135,00:14:47.803,Quiet!
00:14:54.143,00:14:56.145,"Knights, we've found my balloon."
00:14:56.937,00:14:58.105,"Stay there, balloon."
00:14:58.314,00:15:02.401,"I, brave Knight Charlie, will save you."
00:15:04.028,00:15:05.029,I just got to...
00:15:06.572,00:15:07.489,Yuh-oh.
00:15:08.824,00:15:11.702,"Charlie, your balloon is floating away again."
00:15:11.911,00:15:13.245,Yeah!
00:15:13.829,00:15:14.830,"Oh, no!"
00:15:15.164,00:15:16.457,Colour me green.
00:15:16.957,00:15:18.083,I'm worried.
00:15:21.754,00:15:23.047,my balloon.
00:15:24.590,00:15:27.384,Our story's getting sticky.
00:15:27.885,00:15:29.345,What should we do next?
00:15:29.553,00:15:32.181,What can we create to get my balloon?
00:15:37.269,00:15:38.437,How about a ladder?
00:15:41.690,00:15:43.025,Or...
00:15:43.359,00:15:45.611,This is a knight story.
00:15:46.028,00:15:47.947,How about a castle?
00:15:48.155,00:15:50.950,We can climb to the top and get my balloon.
00:15:51.825,00:15:54.578,Let's create a really tall castle.
00:15:54.828,00:15:58.999,Let's shake it up!
00:16:05.839,00:16:07.883,Let's make the castle walls.
00:16:08.968,00:16:11.053,What shape can we use for a wall?
00:16:13.389,00:16:16.141,This rectangle would make a great wall.
00:16:18.894,00:16:20.604,This doesn't look very tall.
00:16:21.230,00:16:24.984,Let's try spinning it the other way like this.
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.486,That's tall.
00:16:34.785,00:16:36.704,Let's try this square...
00:16:37.496,00:16:38.372,like this.
00:16:38.706,00:16:40.207,That's tall.
00:16:40.457,00:16:44.169,And now we need a door to get inside and up.
00:16:45.087,00:16:48.048,What shape should we use to make the door?
00:16:50.259,00:16:54.763,"One rectangle, one door. Let's make it even more castle-y."
00:16:55.222,00:16:56.557,"Drum roll, please."
00:17:00.227,00:17:02.187,"Now, back to our story."
00:17:03.022,00:17:04.773,-Ah-mazing. -Nice.
00:17:07.317,00:17:14.867,"Okay, brave knights and silly squires, to the top of the castle to get my balloon."
00:17:19.580,00:17:20.664,Stick with us.
00:17:34.011,00:17:35.345,Phew-a-doof.
00:17:37.181,00:17:38.223,There it is.
00:17:38.557,00:17:39.475,My balloon!
00:17:39.850,00:17:40.809,"Grab it, knights!"
00:17:45.731,00:17:46.982,Brilliant.
00:17:47.066,00:17:48.150,Yeh-hess!
00:17:48.233,00:17:49.985,We got the balloon!

00:17:55.449,00:17:56.366,The balloon!
00:17:57.993,00:17:58.994,A dragon!
00:17:59.369,00:18:01.121,Now that's a plot twist.
00:18:06.168,00:18:08.003,"Hey! Oh, no!"
00:18:08.337,00:18:09.254,Help!
00:18:11.381,00:18:13.801,"Oh, no! Our friends are floating away!"
00:18:16.470,00:18:18.639,Our story's getting stickier.
00:18:18.847,00:18:21.391,How can we save our friends?
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.559,Help!
00:18:34.738,00:18:36.115,bouncy castle.
00:18:37.199,00:18:40.994,We can bounce up to save Red and Grandma Squire.
00:18:44.748,00:18:46.208,"We're coming for you, Red."
00:18:48.085,00:18:50.921,"Oh, no! I don't think I can bounce any higher."
00:18:51.713,00:18:52.923,"Come on, Charlie."
00:18:53.298,00:18:55.008,We are brave knights!
00:18:55.092,00:18:56.635,-We are brave knights! -We are brave knights!
00:18:56.718,00:18:58.428,-We are brave knights! -We are brave knights!
00:19:02.808,00:19:03.767,Yeah!
00:19:06.145,00:19:08.230,"-Phew! -Thanks, knights."
00:19:08.313,00:19:10.107,"And thank you, silly squires."
00:19:13.110,00:19:14.653,And stick.
00:19:18.157,00:19:20.701,And now let's deal with this dragon.
00:19:21.410,00:19:23.954,"Dragon, it is I, Knight Charlie."
00:19:24.454,00:19:26.498,Please give me back my balloon.
00:19:30.711,00:19:31.587,Hey!
00:19:32.796,00:19:35.299,The dragon won't let me go near my balloon.
00:19:39.344,00:19:41.221,Is this how our story ends?
00:19:49.229,00:19:53.233,"And in our story, we duel by dancing."
00:19:53.400,00:19:55.277,The winner gets the balloon.
00:19:56.361,00:19:57.321,Yeah!
00:19:58.197,00:19:59.573,Brilliant!
00:19:59.656,00:20:00.699,"Oh, yeah!"
00:20:09.917,00:20:11.835,"Oh, sweet!"
00:20:18.425,00:20:19.718,"Go, Dragon."
00:20:30.437,00:20:32.189,The dragon's really good.
00:20:32.648,00:20:34.191,"You can do it, Charlie."
00:20:34.274,00:20:36.944,Do it. Show that dragon what you've got.
00:20:57.881,00:20:58.757,Yeah.
00:21:10.394,00:21:12.479,"Yeah, Charlie wins!"
00:21:14.439,00:21:15.565,Colour me happy.
00:21:17.067,00:21:18.485,Yeh-hess!
00:21:23.073,00:21:26.326,"Look, the dragon is trying to fly away..."
00:21:26.785,00:21:28.412,but it can't.
00:21:29.454,00:21:32.165,"Is that why you took the balloon, Dragon?"
00:21:32.541,00:21:34.167,So you could fly?
00:21:37.879,00:21:40.215,"It's okay, little dragon."
00:21:40.299,00:21:42.134,I'll draw you bigger wings.
00:21:43.468,00:21:46.096,And now you can fly!
00:21:49.558,00:21:50.559,Colour up.
00:22:10.662,00:22:12.706,Now that was a brave story.
00:22:13.457,00:22:14.499,The end.
00:22:15.334,00:22:16.251,Or is it?
00:22:17.002,00:22:19.921,What if we went to a land of dragons?
00:22:21.840,00:22:23.967,What do you think would happen next?
00:00:14.347,00:00:16.349,Hi!
00:00:20.687,00:00:22.188,Do you like to go fast?
00:00:26.818,00:00:28.445,I think I can win a race.
00:00:34.576,00:00:35.910,In a story.
00:00:36.536,00:00:38.580,Will you create a race story with me?
00:00:40.874,00:00:42.042,Let's go!
00:00:42.333,00:00:47.630,I feel a story coming on!
00:01:06.232,00:01:09.819,Here's something that you're not gonna wanna miss Let's give that plot a twist!
00:01:18.953,00:01:20.497,Vroom!
00:01:20.580,00:01:22.916,Let's get this story started.
00:01:24.000,00:01:25.627,"Vroom, vroom, vroom."
00:01:26.044,00:01:27.712,Once upon a time...
00:01:29.714,00:01:36.095,you and I were at the starting line of Colorforms City Race.
00:01:36.179,00:01:39.015,And here comes some of our favorite characters.
00:01:39.140,00:01:40.767,Violet and Red.
00:01:40.850,00:01:41.810,"Hey, hey, Charlie."
00:01:52.278,00:01:58.034,"Just put this wheel here, plunger controls back on like this, and the basket, and stick."
00:01:58.743,00:02:00.161,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:09.546,00:02:13.800,"And now, Miss Weather with the race report."
00:02:13.883,00:02:15.009,Race report!
00:02:15.135,00:02:21.599,It's a sunny day today in Colorforms City with 100 percent chance of racing.
00:02:31.818,00:02:34.445,-Whoo-hoo! -Hooray!
00:02:34.529,00:02:35.780,"Thanks, Miss Weather."
00:02:35.864,00:02:39.993,And whoever gets to the top of Birthday Cake Mountain first...
00:02:42.495,00:02:44.414,golden circle.
00:02:49.836,00:02:51.963,You can take any path you want...
00:02:52.046,00:02:55.800,As long as you get to the top of the mountain.
00:03:02.390,00:03:03.892,"-go! -Yeah, guys!"
00:03:05.643,00:03:08.521,-I winning! -Yuh-oh.
00:03:18.781,00:03:22.243,She's going the wrong way. Silly baby.
00:03:22.410,00:03:24.954,"-Excuse me, bouncing through. -Charlie."
00:03:35.256,00:03:36.591,"Bye, Charlie."
00:03:40.136,00:03:44.015,What? That tunnel goes right to Birthdayville.
00:04:01.282,00:04:02.700,"Let's go, let's go."
00:04:10.416,00:04:13.127,We're last in the race.
00:04:15.171,00:04:18.383,Our story is getting sticky.
00:04:18.466,00:04:21.928,"Storyteller, what do you think we should do next?"
00:04:24.013,00:04:26.391,I think we need to go faster.
00:04:27.600,00:04:30.061,"Uh, idea break."
00:04:31.688,00:04:33.940,How about we add wheels?
00:04:35.066,00:04:38.111,Nope. Too wobbly.
00:04:38.778,00:04:42.073,"How about a fast, fast rocket engine?"
00:04:45.868,00:04:47.412,Ooh...!
00:04:47.495,00:04:50.498,What if we add wings?
00:04:51.165,00:04:54.836,That will work. Then we can bounce even higher.
00:04:54.919,00:04:58.423,Will you help me create a pogo stick with wings?
00:04:59.799,00:05:04.137,Let's... sha-aa-ke it up!
00:05:13.813,00:05:17.817,What shape can we use to make huge wings?
00:05:20.486,00:05:22.989,This triangle is a nice big wing.
00:05:33.166,00:05:35.501,We could try this triangle.
00:05:44.677,00:05:48.014,Let's use this small triangle.
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.016,"Ooh, it's like a puzzle."
00:05:50.224,00:05:52.518,What shape should we add next?
00:05:54.270,00:05:56.189,How about this triangle?
00:05:58.691,00:06:01.194,What shape can we use to finish our wing?
00:06:04.238,00:06:07.116,"Ooh, I think I know. The square."
00:06:07.867,00:06:12.080,Ooh-da-doo!
00:06:12.497,00:06:14.123,I like it.
00:06:14.207,00:06:16.834,Our story is shaping up.
00:06:27.386,00:06:29.931,And now we're in Birthdayville.
00:06:30.014,00:06:32.058,We're catching up.
00:06:33.726,00:06:37.480,Charlie's still last in the race but he's bouncing fast.
00:06:47.198,00:06:48.699,Hello.
00:06:49.659,00:06:50.910,Whoa.
00:06:50.993,00:06:55.289,"Charlie, that is the most brilliant thing I have ever seen!"
00:06:56.999,00:07:00.211,Keep moving those plungers. Whee!
00:07:02.004,00:07:04.423,And now we're passing Baby.
00:07:04.674,00:07:07.301,"-Hi, silly. -Hey, hey."
00:07:24.777,00:07:27.947,"I'm in last place, again!"
00:07:30.283,00:07:33.870,Our story is getting stickier. And...
00:07:34.287,00:07:36.330,I'm actually stuck.
00:07:41.043,00:07:45.047,Who can get me out of this cloud and back to the race?
00:07:53.931,00:07:57.101,"-Hey, Charlie. -I need to catch up in this race."
00:07:59.061,00:08:02.231,"Well, it is one of my thicker clouds."
00:08:13.493,00:08:18.164,Whoa! Birthday Cake Mountain. Color me happy.
00:08:28.716,00:08:29.800,"Whoa, whoa."
00:08:40.853,00:08:44.065,Red and Violet's car looks really broken this time.
00:08:44.148,00:08:46.359,They'll never finish the race.
00:08:55.868,00:08:56.869,No!
00:09:02.750,00:09:05.378,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:05.461,00:09:08.756,Stick with me!
00:09:10.883,00:09:14.929,"-Violet, Red, are you okay? -Charlie, you came back."
00:09:15.012,00:09:19.308,"We're okay. Our car, not so much."
00:09:19.392,00:09:23.396,A race isn't a race without my two best friends.
00:09:23.479,00:09:24.647,Hop on.
00:09:34.740,00:09:38.619,Oh. And now we're all out of the race.
00:09:38.703,00:09:42.206,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:09:47.420,00:09:48.379,Ooh.
00:09:53.092,00:09:54.510,For floatiness.
00:09:56.387,00:09:58.097,Friend-tastic!
00:10:03.436,00:10:08.024,Okay. Who wants to ride in our brand new Flying-Bouncing Balloon?
00:10:10.318,00:10:13.279,-I'm Red-y. -Stick with us.
00:10:13.362,00:10:15.698,Let's go win this race.
00:10:30.755,00:10:34.008,"In first place, the baby!"
00:10:35.426,00:10:37.887,"-You did it! -Yay, Baby!"
00:10:38.137,00:10:42.767,"-And in second place, us. -Yeah, guys, we did it."
00:10:42.850,00:10:44.393,We're second.
00:10:48.689,00:10:50.399,-That was amazing! -Whoo-hoo!
00:10:51.567,00:10:52.777,The end.
00:11:00.409,00:11:04.997,...in Upside-Down Land where everything is...
00:11:06.165,00:11:07.875,upside-down?
00:11:07.958,00:11:10.461,What do you think would happen next?
00:11:12.338,00:11:15.341,You've got a story to create!
00:11:22.139,00:11:24.100,Ready for another one?
00:11:30.064,00:11:32.566,"Come on, you can do it, Charlie."
00:11:32.691,00:11:37.863,You are brave. You are brave. You are-- Whoa!
00:11:40.324,00:11:44.328,"Hey, you know where we could be really brave?"
00:11:44.412,00:11:45.996,In a story.
00:11:47.039,00:11:48.124,Hmm.
00:11:48.207,00:11:51.293,What kind of character is really brave?
00:11:53.129,00:11:55.840,I know. We could be Brave Knights.
00:12:01.804,00:12:07.560,I feel a story coming on!
00:12:38.549,00:12:41.177,Let's get this story started.
00:12:42.219,00:12:44.889,"Once upon a time, you and I..."
00:12:46.807,00:12:48.517,Toot-tootle-toot!
00:12:51.896,00:12:56.692,And we were brave knights looking for someone to help.
00:12:56.817,00:12:58.110,Stick with me.
00:13:02.990,00:13:04.450,Someone needs our help.
00:13:04.533,00:13:06.035,Toot-tootle-toot!
00:13:10.623,00:13:14.460,"Hey, hey, Violet and Red. How can I knightly help?"
00:13:17.505,00:13:20.466,What? My hot-air balloon?
00:13:25.429,00:13:29.725,We brave knights will save the hot-air balloon.
00:13:31.310,00:13:33.646,You are now Red the Knight.
00:13:41.153,00:13:42.238,Halt!
00:13:43.030,00:13:47.034,-Hmm. -And brave knights need silly squires.
00:13:53.290,00:13:54.500,Yay!
00:14:03.634,00:14:06.929,Hmm. I wonder who took it.
00:14:21.068,00:14:22.444,Dragons?
00:14:22.528,00:14:25.906,We won't know until we find the balloon.
00:14:26.198,00:14:28.033,Do you see it?
00:14:29.785,00:14:32.746,"Charlie, the balloon is yonder."
00:14:34.707,00:14:36.041,Toot-tootle-loo!
00:14:36.125,00:14:38.294,"Knights, to the balloon!"
00:14:43.799,00:14:45.593,-Shh! -Shh!
00:14:52.808,00:14:54.018,Toot-tootle-loo!
00:14:54.101,00:14:56.520,"Knights, we found my balloon."
00:14:56.979,00:14:58.147,"Stay there, balloon."
00:14:58.230,00:15:02.735,"I, Brave Knight Charlie, will save you."
00:15:06.572,00:15:07.740,Yuh-oh.
00:15:08.782,00:15:11.785,"Charlie, your balloon is floating away again."
00:15:11.911,00:15:13.454,Uh-yah!
00:15:13.746,00:15:18.542,"Oh, no. Color me green. I'm worried."
00:15:18.626,00:15:23.505,We can't reach my balloon.
00:15:24.590,00:15:27.718,Our story's getting sticky.
00:15:35.267,00:15:37.102,Idea break.
00:15:37.269,00:15:38.562,How about a ladder?
00:15:41.607,00:15:43.233,Or...
00:15:43.317,00:15:47.821,This is a knight story. How about a castle?
00:15:47.947,00:15:51.367,We can climb to the top and get my balloon.
00:15:54.787,00:15:59.041,Let's... sha-aa-ke it up!
00:16:05.798,00:16:08.092,Let's make the castle walls.
00:16:08.842,00:16:11.178,What shape can we use for the wall?
00:16:17.518,00:16:21.021,"Hmm, this doesn't look very tall."
00:16:21.188,00:16:25.359,"Let's try spinning it the other way, like this."
00:16:26.360,00:16:27.736,That's tall.
00:16:27.820,00:16:28.988,Ooh.
00:16:29.405,00:16:32.992,What shape can we add to make it even taller?
00:16:37.413,00:16:38.622,Like this.
00:16:38.706,00:16:40.457,That's tall.
00:16:40.541,00:16:44.461,"And now, we need a door to get inside and up."
00:16:45.170,00:16:48.424,What shape should we use to make the door?
00:16:50.175,00:16:52.594,"One rectangle, one door."

00:18:23.018,00:18:25.938,"Ooh, I wish we could just bounce up and grab it."

00:19:39.344,00:19:41.513,Is this how our story ends?
00:19:42.222,00:19:45.767,No. It's time for something big to happen.
00:19:45.851,00:19:49.062,"When knights can't agree, they duel."
00:19:49.188,00:19:53.317,"And in our story, we duel by dancing."
00:19:53.483,00:19:55.319,The winner gets the balloon!

00:21:26.702,00:21:28.745,But it can't.
00:21:29.413,00:21:32.457,"Is that why you took the balloon, dragon?"
00:21:32.541,00:21:34.126,So you could fly?
00:21:37.004,00:21:40.173,"Oh. It's okay, little dragon."
00:21:40.299,00:21:42.217,I'll draw you bigger wings.
00:21:43.510,00:21:46.179,And now you can fly.

00:01:06.149,00:01:11.780,I feel a story coming on!
00:01:12.614,00:01:14.199,Let's get this story started!
00:01:31.966,00:01:33.510,Let's give that plot a twist!
00:01:43.728,00:01:46.272,Let's get this story started!
00:01:46.356,00:01:48.024,Once upon a time...
00:01:49.609,00:01:53.363,"you and I were on Color Street, singing."
00:02:07.669,00:02:09.796,Let's sing!
00:02:13.842,00:02:16.177,And you know what rock stars need?
00:02:16.970,00:02:18.596,A rock band.
00:02:18.680,00:02:22.767,"So, we need some more characters for our story."
00:02:23.351,00:02:27.480,"-Hey, hey, Charlie. -Did you say rock stars?"
00:02:27.564,00:02:32.527,"Yup. Check out these rock stars, Violet and Red."

00:03:49.896,00:03:51.189,Mic check.

00:04:08.122,00:04:09.290,Color me!
00:04:15.129,00:04:17.840,What? Where did all this rain come from?
00:04:27.141,00:04:29.435,Where did that rain come from?
00:04:34.023,00:04:36.317,What should happen next in our story?
00:04:36.401,00:04:40.321,How can we block the rain so we can keep playing?
00:04:42.282,00:04:43.866,What about an umbrella?
00:04:44.117,00:04:47.912,"Yes, yes. A super-big umbrella."
00:04:54.460,00:04:59.215,"Hey, let's get creative and make this story even better."
00:04:59.299,00:05:03.177,What if we went inside the beach ball?
00:05:08.057,00:05:10.143,...be so silly.
00:05:11.144,00:05:14.981,A little sticky magic and we're going in.
00:05:19.986,00:05:21.738,"Brilliant, Charlie."
00:05:29.078,00:05:31.039,Let's rock and roll!
00:05:31.122,00:05:32.498,Clap with me!
00:05:32.582,00:05:34.959,All right. Color me!

00:05:47.263,00:05:48.973,-Whoa! -What?
00:05:51.476,00:05:53.770,I know you're in there.
00:05:54.228,00:06:00.568,"Oh! If Miss Weather keeps bothering us, we can't sing our song."
00:06:04.906,00:06:06.282,Whoa!
00:06:13.623,00:06:16.125,"Hey, there's no weather where I'm from."
00:06:16.209,00:06:19.045,No weather? Where are you from?
00:06:19.128,00:06:22.173,Underwater. In the Colorsea.
00:06:22.298,00:06:24.717,Then that's where we need to go.
00:06:27.261,00:06:30.515,Our story is getting stickier.
00:06:30.598,00:06:33.351,How can we get down under the Colorsea?
00:06:33.434,00:06:36.854,"Hey, storyteller, what goes underwater?"
00:06:39.232,00:06:40.900,How about a submarine?
00:06:40.983,00:06:42.944,-Scuba divers? -Me?
00:06:45.196,00:06:46.739,A fish?
00:06:48.449,00:06:51.994,What if we turn this beach ball into a fish?
00:06:52.078,00:06:55.206,Then it can swim us underwater.
00:06:55.289,00:06:59.460,Let's sha-a-a-ake it up!
00:07:08.261,00:07:14.809,"OK, we need some fins so our beach-ball fish can swim us underwater."
00:07:20.231,00:07:23.067,Let's try these triangles.
00:07:26.612,00:07:31.534,And now our fish needs some eyes so it can see where it's going.
00:07:32.618,00:07:35.079,What shape can we use for eyes?
00:07:37.331,00:07:40.251,How about these circles?
00:07:43.129,00:07:45.548,And what shape can we use for the mouth?
00:07:55.266,00:07:57.393,And this is a rock star fish.
00:07:57.477,00:08:01.522,So let's give this fish some rock star hair.
00:08:05.276,00:08:08.446,Boo-da-doo!
00:08:09.864,00:08:12.033,"Ready, Rock Star Beach Ball Fish?"
00:08:12.116,00:08:13.284,Glub-glub.
00:08:20.708,00:08:26.547,"Rock stars, we're going underwater, inside a rock star beach ball fish."
00:08:26.631,00:08:28.049,-Ooh! -Cool!
00:08:29.842,00:08:30.885,Glub-glub.
00:08:54.825,00:08:57.620,We can finally sing our song.
00:08:57.703,00:09:01.123,Tickle me pink. I'm so excited.
00:09:01.207,00:09:04.335,Ready? Let's rock and roll!
00:09:04.418,00:09:05.670,Clap with me.
00:09:05.753,00:09:07.547,"All right, color me!"
00:09:11.551,00:09:14.720,-What now? -Who is crying?
00:09:20.476,00:09:25.856,"Excuse me, Rock Star Beach Ball Fish? We need to go back up."
00:09:26.107,00:09:27.191,Glub-glub.
00:09:41.706,00:09:44.417,"Miss Weather, why are you crying?"
00:09:44.500,00:09:48.087,Because I wanted to play in your band.
00:09:48.170,00:09:52.091,I tried my rain instrument and I tried my wind instrument.
00:09:53.551,00:09:55.595,And you kept blocking me.
00:09:55.678,00:10:00.141,And now you're playing underwater... without me!
00:10:02.560,00:10:05.771,Miss Weather wanted to play in the band.
00:10:05.855,00:10:08.107,Is this how our story ends?
00:10:09.775,00:10:13.237,Not if we're the ones telling this story.
00:10:13.321,00:10:16.365,"Um, should we let her play in the band with us?"
00:10:17.700,00:10:20.036,"Miss Weather, you're in the band."
00:10:27.293,00:10:29.086,Let's rock and roll!

00:07:50.261,00:07:52.930,What shapes can we use to make a rectangle?
00:07:56.142,00:07:58.728,Two triangles make one rectangle.

00:08:11.157,00:08:13.409,What shape can we use for wheels?
00:08:15.578,00:08:17.580,Let's try these circles.

00:08:46.859,00:08:50.029,This has got to stop my story sneezes.
00:08:53.115,00:08:54.033,Yuh-oh.
00:08:54.116,00:08:56.494,But I'm in my own bed. Why am I... ?

00:09:06.587,00:09:08.548,And I'm floating on bananas?

00:09:20.935,00:09:23.229,and I'm still sneezing.
00:09:23.688,00:09:25.064,Colour me blue.

00:09:34.115,00:09:35.074,"Hey, wait."
00:09:35.283,00:09:37.451,We're the ones telling this story.

00:10:34.884,00:10:38.262,Just tell your story sneezes to take you home.
00:10:38.596,00:10:40.765,You can do that in a story.
00:10:41.098,00:10:45.436,-Take us home. Take us home. -Take us home. Take us home.

00:16:58.434,00:17:00.853,tomato-sauce ice cream!

00:04:18.549,00:04:21.135,Roar-roar-roar-roar! Ha-ha!
00:04:21.636,00:04:24.347,A nose shake will stop my sneezes?
00:04:25.765,00:04:28.977,-Yeah! -Whoo-hoo!
00:04:29.060,00:04:30.687,Yuh-oh!

00:04:45.201,00:04:48.413,"And, ooh! My Mighty Charlie costume!"
00:04:48.496,00:04:50.039,What kind of story is this?
00:05:10.852,00:05:13.021,Maybe you need a special pillow!
00:05:13.938,00:05:15.648,Whoa-a-doh-doh!
00:05:16.941,00:05:18.943,I hope you feel better!

00:05:32.707,00:05:35.168,I can't stop sneezing.
00:05:35.251,00:05:37.253,What kind of story am I in now?
00:05:38.463,00:05:41.132,A Silly Nose doctor's office story.
00:05:55.104,00:05:58.691,The story sneezes? You need a new nose.
00:05:58.775,00:06:00.818,Whee! Ha ha ha ha ha!
00:06:00.902,00:06:02.153,Ha ha ha ho!
00:06:04.238,00:06:06.741,Pickle or pear? Ha ha!
00:06:06.824,00:06:10.495,Hee hee hee! A pickle or pear nose? What?
00:06:10.578,00:06:14.207,"Doctor, isn't there anything else I can do?"
00:06:20.421,00:06:23.216,...rest in your own bed.
00:06:23.299,00:06:26.844,Do you think resting in my own bed will stop my story sneezes?
00:06:28.638,00:06:30.807,I gotta try! Yuh-oh.
00:06:31.182,00:06:32.725,Gonna sneeze.
00:06:46.030,00:06:49.742,What? The desert... again?
00:06:49.826,00:06:56.040,Ohh. How am I going to get to my own bed if I keep sneezing to different stories?
00:06:58.709,00:07:01.462,Our story's getting stickier!
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.589,"What should do we do next, storyteller?"
00:07:09.846,00:07:15.226,"Storyteller, let's get creative and make this story even better!"
00:07:15.810,00:07:20.148,What if we create my bed right here in this story?
00:07:23.359,00:07:27.280,Will you help me make my bed right here before I sneeze again?
00:07:30.825,00:07:35.037,Let's shake it up!
00:07:47.049,00:07:50.094,Yuh-oh! We don't have a big rectangle.
00:07:50.178,00:07:53.097,What shapes can we use to make a rectangle?
00:07:56.267,00:07:59.312,Two triangles make one rectangle.
00:08:00.730,00:08:03.107,And now we need legs for the bed.
00:08:04.275,00:08:07.153,"And on my bed, the legs are wheels."
00:08:07.236,00:08:09.989,Like a race car! Vroom!
00:08:10.072,00:08:11.157,Hee hee hee!
00:08:15.620,00:08:17.371,Let's try these circles.
00:08:19.207,00:08:21.292,Now we just need pillows.
00:08:23.252,00:08:25.129,What shape can we use for pillows?
00:08:28.049,00:08:30.676,These rectangles are just right.
00:08:31.844,00:08:33.846,"Drumroll, please."
00:08:36.390,00:08:39.143,My bed! Let's try this!
00:08:45.399,00:08:50.112,Ahh. This has gotta stop my story sneezes.
00:08:50.530,00:08:52.907,Ah... ah...
00:08:52.990,00:09:01.415,Yuh-oh. But I'm in my own bed. Why am I-- ah... achoo-choo!
00:09:08.631,00:09:12.385,"Oh, when will I stop my story sneezes?"
00:09:20.977,00:09:23.563,And I'm still sneezing!
00:09:23.646,00:09:26.983,Color me blue. I'm so sad.
00:09:27.483,00:09:30.069,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:33.864,00:09:37.535,"Hey, wait. We're the ones telling this story."
00:09:40.955,00:09:44.584,"Maybe I need to rest in my own bed, at home!"
00:09:44.667,00:09:49.255,So... we're going to tell my sneezes to take me home.
00:09:49.338,00:09:50.631,Say it with me.
00:09:51.132,00:09:54.385,Take Charlie home. Take Charlie home.
00:09:54.719,00:09:56.429,Take Charlie-- huh?
00:09:56.512,00:09:59.056,Ah... ah... achoo-choo!
00:10:04.061,00:10:07.356,We did it! I sneezed myself home.
00:10:08.316,00:10:09.900,Ah... achoo!
00:10:12.320,00:10:16.741,I don't have the story sneezes anymore! Just the sneezes!
00:10:27.835,00:10:30.630,"We caught the story sneezes, too."
00:10:32.340,00:10:34.717,Oh. I know just the thing.
00:10:49.065,00:10:50.441,It worked!
00:10:57.198,00:10:59.992,The end. Or is it?
00:11:03.162,00:11:05.247,What do you think would happen next?
00:11:08.668,00:11:11.462,You've got a story to create!
00:11:14.256,00:11:15.132,Achoo!

00:14:06.929,00:14:08.597,Don't try this at home!
00:14:16.021,00:14:18.315,I wonder who our customers will be?
00:14:21.318,00:14:25.656,We can serve pizza to any character we want.
00:14:26.448,00:14:28.701,-Even robots? -Or dragons?

00:15:59.792,00:16:02.836,Will you help me make pizza ice cream cones?
00:16:15.349,00:16:19.103,OK. We're making two pizza ice cream cones.
00:16:19.186,00:16:21.105,One for each snowman.
00:16:22.564,00:16:25.734,What shapes can we use for the scoops of ice cream?
00:16:29.029,00:16:31.281,These circles look like scoops.
00:16:32.574,00:16:36.161,"OK, now we need to make the pointy cone part."

00:03:30.668,00:03:34.172,What should we do? How can we help Baby get her sillies back?
00:03:34.464,00:03:38.009,We've got silly things all over Colorforms City.
00:03:40.136,00:03:43.264,"Just follow me, the master of silly!"
00:03:43.640,00:03:47.894,"First silly stop, the Silly-Willy Costume Shop!"
00:03:47.977,00:03:49.187,Stick with me.
00:03:49.270,00:03:50.605,Conga!
00:03:57.153,00:04:01.157,Here we are at the Silly-Willy Costume Shop!
00:04:04.160,00:04:05.703,Look at my helmet!
00:04:06.079,00:04:07.872,Mine's got horns.
00:04:10.041,00:04:11.417,"Oh, yeah!"
00:04:21.386,00:04:22.679,No silly!
00:04:22.762,00:04:24.430,What?
00:04:24.514,00:04:26.599,"Well, that didn't work."
00:04:26.891,00:04:28.142,What's next?
00:04:31.688,00:04:34.691,"Look, Baby, we're now a..."
00:04:35.692,00:04:37.360,silly kitchen band!
00:04:37.443,00:04:40.363,Charlie and the Snacks!
00:04:54.043,00:04:56.421,Rock star!
00:04:56.879,00:04:58.840,Wanna be in the silly band?
00:05:05.638,00:05:07.432,That didn't work either.
00:05:16.274,00:05:18.776,Our story's getting stickier.
00:05:18.860,00:05:26.326,"If Baby doesn't think anything here on Colour Street is silly, then we have to take her somewhere else."
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.244,-Somewhere else! -Somewhere else!
00:05:28.328,00:05:31.622,And we should go in the silliest way possible.
00:05:32.081,00:05:35.460,What kind of silly vehicle can we make to make Baby laugh?
00:05:37.712,00:05:38.796,Idea break!
00:05:41.674,00:05:43.885,How about we make a boat...
00:05:47.638,00:05:52.685,Or how about a train that goes underwater?
00:05:56.689,00:05:58.316,Or we can do both!
00:05:58.608,00:06:05.531,"Let's make a silly boat-train that can go on land, underwater, anywhere that we want..."
00:06:06.032,00:06:08.826,so we can find Baby some silly!
00:06:12.121,00:06:13.998,I think this might work.
00:06:14.207,00:06:16.667,Will you create a silly boat-train with me?
00:06:18.336,00:06:22.465,Let's shake it up!
00:06:29.013,00:06:30.056,Okay.
00:06:30.139,00:06:32.683,Let's make our first boat on the train.
00:06:45.446,00:06:47.198,What can we use for a sail?
00:06:50.284,00:06:52.120,How about a triangle?
00:06:55.248,00:06:58.251,Yipes! We need something to attach it to.
00:06:59.877,00:07:01.504,What can we use?
00:07:03.506,00:07:05.925,This thin rectangle works.
00:07:10.304,00:07:12.807,And now let's make it a train.
00:07:13.307,00:07:17.186,Boo-da-doo!
00:07:18.688,00:07:21.899,Let's ride this boat-train back to that baby!
00:07:28.239,00:07:31.451,All aboard the silly boat-train!
00:07:34.245,00:07:39.667,"With the silliest captain of the seas, Captain Baby!"
00:07:40.418,00:07:45.131,"Next stop, somewhere that is going to bring back Baby's sillies!"
00:07:45.214,00:07:46.382,We hope.
00:07:47.133,00:07:49.051,Looking good!
00:07:53.848,00:07:55.308,No silly!
00:08:07.778,00:08:08.738,I'm good!
00:08:12.950,00:08:13.868,Yeah!
00:08:14.160,00:08:15.161,Yes!
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.122,This is fun!
00:08:21.792,00:08:23.711,No silly!
00:08:31.052,00:08:32.970,No silly!
00:08:40.978,00:08:42.188,No silly.
00:08:54.408,00:08:55.910,No silly!
00:08:58.913,00:09:04.126,"Now we've really tried everything, but the Baby Silly Face still isn't silly."
00:09:11.509,00:09:14.262,The Baby Silly Face still isn't laughing.
00:09:14.345,00:09:16.222,Will you try to make her laugh?
00:09:16.305,00:09:18.224,Try your silly faces!
00:09:22.186,00:09:24.146,You are so silly!
00:09:24.647,00:09:27.066,That must have made Baby laugh!
00:09:27.650,00:09:29.318,No silly!
00:09:29.402,00:09:30.695,Not laughing.
00:09:30.987,00:09:32.321,Nothing is working!
00:09:36.742,00:09:39.745,Colour me blue. I'm so sad.
00:09:41.205,00:09:43.541,Is this how our story ends?
00:09:45.376,00:09:48.212,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:09:48.337,00:09:50.590,It's time for something big to happen.
00:09:51.007,00:09:54.468,"Baby, if you don't want to be silly, that's okay."
00:09:54.552,00:09:56.721,"We just want to be with you, so..."
00:09:57.054,00:09:58.764,"we'll just be grumpy, too."
00:10:04.061,00:10:05.104,Silly!
00:10:05.354,00:10:06.314,What?
00:10:12.069,00:10:14.780,"You, too! Make a grumpy face!"
00:10:18.576,00:10:20.995,"-I'm a grumpy Violet! -Grumpy. Grumpy, grumpy."
00:10:21.662,00:10:22.580,Grumpy.
00:10:24.874,00:10:26.125,Silly.
00:10:26.417,00:10:27.835,Grumpiest faces!
00:10:38.054,00:10:39.472,Phewf-a-doof.
00:10:39.555,00:10:41.849,Baby Silly Face laughing again!
00:10:41.932,00:10:43.267,We did it!
00:10:43.893,00:10:44.894,Yeah!
00:10:47.396,00:10:49.190,"And I feel silly, too."
00:10:52.818,00:10:53.819,Do you?
00:10:55.905,00:10:57.156,The end.
00:10:57.657,00:10:58.741,Or is it?
00:10:59.075,00:11:01.661,We could ride this silly boat-train underground.
00:11:30.856,00:11:31.816,Klunk?
00:11:36.612,00:11:38.572,"Have you seen my pet, Klunk?"
00:11:40.741,00:11:42.618,He was just here a second ago.
00:11:44.495,00:11:45.329,Klunk!
00:11:52.545,00:11:58.426,"If you were really missing, I'd be a detective and find you!"
00:12:00.803,00:12:03.514,You know where we could be a detective?
00:12:03.681,00:12:04.974,In a story!
00:12:05.516,00:12:08.227,Will you create a detective story with me?
00:12:11.439,00:12:16.485,I feel a story coming on!
00:12:18.028,00:12:19.655,Let's get this story started!
00:12:19.739,00:12:24.285,Charlie's Colorforms City Yeah -Say hey -Hey!

00:12:37.465,00:12:39.008,Let's give that plot a twist!
00:12:54.940,00:12:57.276,EPISODE TITLE Once upon a time...

00:13:25.971,00:13:28.808,"Let's see, an orange traffic cone."
00:13:31.769,00:13:33.604,Three yellow flowers.
00:13:36.816,00:13:38.901,Nothing mysterious yet.
00:13:39.985,00:13:53.582,"Orange traffic cone, grey postbox, three yellow flo-- Charlie, did you say a blue postbox?"
00:13:53.666,00:13:56.085,This postbox is not blue.
00:13:58.504,00:14:01.048,The colour from the postbox is missing.
00:14:01.507,00:14:03.384,It vanished.
00:14:03.884,00:14:07.012,It's the Mystery of the Vanishing Colour!
00:14:10.724,00:14:12.768,"Lightning and thunder, Charlie!"
00:14:13.227,00:14:16.438,Let's go look for clues to solve this mystery.
00:14:19.608,00:14:20.943,We'll search low.
00:14:34.790,00:14:35.791,Yikes!
00:14:41.547,00:14:44.341,We'll leave no leaf unturned!
00:14:46.886,00:14:49.430,"A round, blue footprint!"
00:14:49.722,00:14:52.641,Tickle me pink! I'm so excited!
00:14:52.725,00:14:58.272,Our first clue in the Mystery of the Vanishing Colour.
00:14:59.899,00:15:02.776,That's the colour the postbox used to be.
00:15:10.576,00:15:15.497,That means whoever took the colour from the postbox must have...
00:15:16.874,00:15:18.709,four round feet!
00:15:21.921,00:15:25.925,Will you help me figure out who has four round feet?
00:15:27.468,00:15:28.469,Great!
00:15:37.561,00:15:39.188,Does Red have four feet?
00:15:39.271,00:15:40.314,Nope.
00:15:40.481,00:15:42.691,-Violet? -Nope.
00:15:51.408,00:15:52.409,No feet!
00:15:53.744,00:15:55.371,Colour me purple!
00:15:55.663,00:15:57.498,I'm frustrated.
00:15:57.790,00:15:59.875,We didn't find any matches.
00:16:00.250,00:16:02.753,Our story is getting sticky.
00:16:06.548,00:16:09.093,Let me see your feet.
00:16:19.436,00:16:21.230,Nope. Just two feet.
00:16:22.147,00:16:23.065,Silly.
00:16:23.482,00:16:26.110,Will you help us look for more clues?
00:16:28.404,00:16:29.238,Great!
00:16:43.460,00:16:47.131,"Look at the tree. Its colour is gone, too."
00:16:48.799,00:16:51.343,There are green and brown footprints now!
00:16:51.427,00:16:53.429,Just like the colour of the tree.
00:16:57.099,00:16:58.767,Stick with us!
00:17:07.401,00:17:11.447,I don't think it's a footprint this time.
00:17:16.201,00:17:17.453,Nice ear!
00:17:19.413,00:17:21.331,It is an ear print.
00:17:21.623,00:17:23.876,But whose ear is up there?
00:17:29.506,00:17:30.632,The building!
00:17:30.716,00:17:36.263,"Someone, or something, is taking the colour right now."
00:17:38.098,00:17:39.308,-What's that? -Look!
00:17:39.558,00:17:41.602,"-Where'd it go? -Oh, no!"
00:17:42.644,00:17:47.649,"Big ears, grey tubey thing, four round feet."
00:17:48.275,00:17:51.278,Our story is getting stickier.
00:17:53.113,00:17:56.492,Let's look at our clues and solve this mystery.
00:17:56.575,00:18:00.829,Let's shake it up!
00:18:08.003,00:18:08.879,Okay.
00:18:09.338,00:18:10.881,Let's look at our clues.
00:18:14.426,00:18:16.386,And what are feet attached to?
00:18:18.514,00:18:19.556,Legs!
00:18:21.016,00:18:23.602,What shape could we use for legs?
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.441,How about... rectangles?
00:18:29.900,00:18:31.652,And now the ear...
00:18:32.152,00:18:33.779,What is an ear attached to?
00:18:37.991,00:18:40.702,What shape can we use for a head?
00:18:43.205,00:18:45.165,Let's try a circle!
00:18:46.834,00:18:48.669,And what else did we see?
00:18:51.046,00:18:52.464,A long grey tube.
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.260,Which shape looks like that tube?
00:19:02.015,00:19:05.394,Let's put that... How about here?
00:19:05.936,00:19:07.813,What animal could this be?
00:19:09.857,00:19:10.983,An elephant?
00:19:12.609,00:19:14.611,I think it is an elephant!
00:19:15.154,00:19:18.323,Let's try a rectangle for the body.
00:19:24.538,00:19:28.500,Boo-da-doo!
00:19:30.961,00:19:36.175,"An elephant is taking our colour, and we're gonna use this elephant to find it!"
00:19:40.554,00:19:42.181,"Hop on, Detective Weather!"
00:19:44.975,00:19:46.351,"Come on, detectives!"
00:19:46.602,00:19:49.646,"Sun and snow, let's go!"
00:19:59.907,00:20:00.908,What?
00:20:02.075,00:20:02.993,No colour!
00:20:03.076,00:20:04.077,"Oh, no!"
00:20:04.411,00:20:06.914,The elephant's heading toward my house!
00:20:16.757,00:20:19.051,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"
00:20:19.134,00:20:21.762,The elephant took the colour right off my stairs.
00:20:24.431,00:20:26.475,Is this how our story ends?
00:20:27.893,00:20:30.938,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:20:31.021,00:20:33.315,It's time for something big to happen.
00:20:35.108,00:20:38.070,"Not in our story, Baby Elephant!"
00:20:38.153,00:20:41.156,You need to stop taking colour from our city!
00:20:42.658,00:20:44.076,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:20:46.286,00:20:48.622,I live in a world without colour.
00:20:50.874,00:20:52.668,A world without colour?
00:20:53.001,00:20:55.128,Everything is just grey.
00:20:55.254,00:20:59.216,So I came to play with all your colour.
00:21:00.425,00:21:02.219,"It's okay, Baby Elephant."
00:21:06.431,00:21:08.183,Miss Weather?
00:21:22.239,00:21:23.615,"Oh, yeah!"
00:21:33.292,00:21:34.209,Yes!
00:21:35.585,00:21:36.420,Yeah!
00:21:38.297,00:21:40.924,I love colour rain!
00:21:43.302,00:21:45.470,I want to play with colour every day!
00:21:45.554,00:21:50.350,And I can come and make colour rain where you live any time you want!
00:21:58.483,00:22:00.736,Colour me happy!
00:22:01.069,00:22:04.698,We solved the Mystery of the Vanishing Colours!
00:22:08.702,00:22:09.995,The end.
00:22:10.662,00:22:11.663,Or is it?
00:22:12.039,00:22:16.752,What if we take the baby elephant home and explore her grey world?
00:22:19.254,00:22:22.049,What would happen next in that story?
00:22:26.386,00:22:29.389,You've got a story to create!
00:00:12.345,00:00:15.515,Whoa. Whoa!
00:00:20.770,00:00:22.647,It fell.
00:00:23.023,00:00:24.983,I'm so sad.
00:00:26.818,00:00:27.652,Huh?
00:00:37.787,00:00:39.122,A penguin?
00:00:41.666,00:00:46.796,Hey! Maybe a silly story will cheer me up even more.
00:00:53.261,00:00:55.722,That would make me so happy!
00:00:56.347,00:01:01.352,I feel a story coming on!
00:01:20.371,00:01:22.207,Here's something That you're not gonna wanna miss.
00:01:37.764,00:01:40.350,Let's get this story started.
00:01:44.437,00:01:48.942,"Once upon a time, you and I, and..."
00:01:54.531,00:01:58.660,...were trying to do the silliest things we could think of!
00:02:08.294,00:02:11.464,"And now, watch out for my..."
00:02:19.222,00:02:20.557,-Yikes! -Whoa!
00:02:32.777,00:02:34.696,Can you make a silly face?
00:02:51.337,00:02:52.255,Whoa!
00:02:57.010,00:02:59.679,"-Oh, yeah! -Hi!"
00:03:01.598,00:03:03.141,Ta-da!
00:03:07.604,00:03:10.356,"Baby, what's your silly?"
00:03:21.826,00:03:26.122,But you are a Silly Face. A Silly Face who isn't silly?
00:03:40.136,00:03:43.556,"Just follow me, the master of silly!"
00:04:02.116,00:04:03.952,Ha? Got my hat on!
00:04:07.956,00:04:09.832,I'm just horsing around.
00:04:09.916,00:04:13.002,"-Oh, yeah. -Bleep-boop!"
00:04:26.891,00:04:28.226,What's next?
00:04:31.688,00:04:35.024,"Look baby, we're now a..."
00:04:57.088,00:04:59.173,Wanna be in the silly band?
00:05:10.601,00:05:13.563,I don't know what else to try on Color Street.
00:05:18.943,00:05:26.451,"If Baby doesn't think anything here on Color Street is silly, then we have to take her someplace else."
00:05:28.328,00:05:31.998,And we should go in the silliest way possible.
00:05:32.081,00:05:35.793,What kind of silly vehicle can we make to make Baby laugh?
00:05:37.170,00:05:39.047,Ooh! Idea break.
00:05:56.689,00:05:58.524,Or we can do both!
00:06:14.207,00:06:16.918,Will you create a silly boat-train with me?
00:06:18.586,00:06:22.673,Let's sha-aa-ke it up!
00:06:29.013,00:06:32.600,"Okay, let's make our first boat on the train."
00:06:32.809,00:06:34.685,What shape can we ride in?
00:06:37.271,00:06:40.316,Let's try this trapezoid.
00:06:45.446,00:06:47.532,What can we use for a sail?
00:06:50.284,00:06:52.495,How about a triangle?
00:06:59.877,00:07:01.712,What can we use?
00:07:03.506,00:07:06.259,This thin rectangle works.
00:07:10.304,00:07:13.099,And now let's make it a train.
00:07:18.688,00:07:22.233,Let's ride this boat-train back to that baby!
00:07:28.239,00:07:31.701,All aboard the silly boat-train!
00:07:34.245,00:07:40.334,"With the silliest captain of the seas, -Captain Baby! -Humph."
00:07:40.543,00:07:45.256,"Next stop, someplace that is going to bring back Baby's sillies!"
00:07:45.339,00:07:46.299,We hope.
00:08:10.740,00:08:12.533,Whoo-hoo!
00:08:14.035,00:08:15.411,Yes!
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.498,This is fun!
00:08:54.408,00:08:56.202,No silly!
00:09:16.305,00:09:18.432,Try your silly faces!
00:09:22.186,00:09:24.313,You are so silly!
00:09:24.564,00:09:27.483,That must have made Baby laugh!
00:09:36.742,00:09:39.996,Color me blue. I'm so sad.
00:09:51.007,00:09:54.594,"Baby, if you don't wanna be silly, that's okay."
00:10:12.069,00:10:15.031,"You, too! Make a grumpy face!"
00:10:52.818,00:10:54.236,Do you?
00:10:55.905,00:10:57.531,The end.
00:10:59.075,00:11:02.244,We could ride this silly boat-train underground.
00:11:10.336,00:11:13.422,You've got a story to create.
00:11:24.517,00:11:25.976,Stick with me!
00:11:29.397,00:11:30.272,Klunk!
00:11:30.856,00:11:32.233,Klunk?
00:11:35.778,00:11:38.864,Hi! Have you seen my pet Klunk?
00:11:40.741,00:11:43.077,He was just here a second ago.
00:12:03.681,00:12:05.391,In a story.
00:12:05.516,00:12:08.436,Will you create a detective story with me?
00:12:35.504,00:12:37.339,Here's something That you're not gonna wanna miss.
00:12:52.480,00:12:55.149,Let's get this story started.
00:13:00.196,00:13:04.825,"and Miss Weather, were detectives!"
00:13:12.791,00:13:17.713,We're on Color Street looking for a mystery to solve.
00:13:25.971,00:13:29.058,"Let's see, an orange traffic cone."
00:13:29.475,00:13:31.435,Blue mailbox.
00:13:53.666,00:13:56.293,'Cause this mailbox is not blue.
00:13:56.377,00:13:57.628,What?
00:14:01.507,00:14:03.717,It vanished.
00:14:19.608,00:14:21.318,We'll search low.
00:14:31.078,00:14:32.079,Hmm.
00:14:41.463,00:14:44.884,We'll leave no leaf unturned!
00:14:59.899,00:15:03.110,That's the color the mailbox used to be.
00:15:33.057,00:15:37.269,Here are our Colorforms City friends and their feet.
00:15:42.900,00:15:45.069,Are those feet?
00:15:51.408,00:15:52.534,No feet!
00:15:53.702,00:15:57.706,Color me purple! I'm frustrated.
00:15:57.790,00:16:00.167,We didn't find any matches.
00:16:23.482,00:16:26.402,Will you help us look for more clues?
00:17:11.530,00:17:12.698,Hmm.
00:17:15.492,00:17:17.661,Ah. Nice ear!
00:17:21.623,00:17:24.209,But whose ear is up there?
00:17:42.644,00:17:44.354,Big ears!
00:17:51.570,00:17:53.113,Who could that be?
00:17:56.700,00:18:01.163,Let's sha-aa-ke it up!
00:18:08.003,00:18:09.171,Okay.
00:18:11.298,00:18:14.343,We've got the four round footprints we found.
00:18:14.426,00:18:16.678,And what are feet attached to?
00:18:18.514,00:18:20.057,Legs!
00:18:21.141,00:18:23.977,What shape could we use for legs?
00:18:26.814,00:18:29.733,How about rectangles?
00:18:29.900,00:18:34.113,And now the ear... What is an ear attached to?
00:18:35.739,00:18:36.907,A head!
00:18:46.834,00:18:48.919,And what else did we see?
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.426,Which shape looks like that tube?
00:19:02.015,00:19:05.853,"Let's put that, how about here?"
00:19:06.019,00:19:07.980,What animal could this be?
00:19:09.857,00:19:11.316,An elephant?
00:19:24.538,00:19:28.250,Boo-da-doo!
00:19:30.961,00:19:36.592,An elephant is taking our color and we're gonna use this elephant to find it!
00:19:36.925,00:19:39.511,Let's go back to our story!
00:19:59.823,00:20:01.408,Wha-aat?!
00:20:12.002,00:20:13.962,Wow!
00:20:19.134,00:20:22.012,The elephant took the color right off my stairs.
00:20:24.306,00:20:26.808,Is this how our story ends?
00:21:08.267,00:21:11.645,Miss Weather thought you'd never ask.
00:21:45.595,00:21:50.392,And I can come make color rain where you live any time you want!
00:21:50.475,00:21:52.144,Really?
00:22:01.069,00:22:05.157,We solved the Mystery of the Vanishing Colors!
00:22:08.702,00:22:10.329,The end.
00:22:10.704,00:22:11.955,Or is it?
00:22:19.379,00:22:22.341,What would happen next in that story?
00:22:26.386,00:22:29.556,You've got a story to create!

00:03:27.290,00:03:28.124,What?
00:03:28.208,00:03:29.918,Violet locked the door.
00:03:30.001,00:03:32.670,We can't find Violet if we can't get in.
00:03:34.547,00:03:37.133,Our story's getting sticky.
00:03:37.217,00:03:40.136,What do we need to open a locked door?
00:03:42.639,00:03:43.848,Yes!
00:03:43.932,00:03:45.433,We need to find a key.
00:03:46.726,00:03:48.186,Not here.
00:03:48.269,00:03:49.646,Maybe here?
00:03:49.729,00:03:51.272,-Not here... -Or over there?

00:04:07.205,00:04:08.373,Brilliant!
00:04:14.337,00:04:18.549,Let's shake it up!
00:04:26.933,00:04:29.852,We'll start with the long part of the key.
00:04:31.229,00:04:33.106,Which shape can we use?
00:04:35.191,00:04:37.652,"How about the long, thin rectangle?"
00:04:40.071,00:04:42.407,Now we need the part that goes into the lock.
00:04:42.490,00:04:43.783,It looks like teeth.
00:04:43.866,00:04:45.660,Chomp! Chomp! Chomp!
00:04:49.539,00:04:51.958,What shape should we use for the teeth?
00:04:54.627,00:04:57.046,Let's try the little rectangles.
00:05:00.800,00:05:02.343,Yipperoo!
00:05:02.427,00:05:04.804,"Now, last but not least, the handle."
00:05:04.887,00:05:07.724,Looks like we need one...
00:05:08.057,00:05:10.601,"two, three circles!"
00:05:14.063,00:05:15.898,But we don't have circles.
00:05:16.399,00:05:18.151,Which shapes can we use?
00:05:20.528,00:05:22.363,How about these semicircles?
00:05:23.156,00:05:25.408,Just fit them together and make...
00:05:26.576,00:05:28.369,one circle.
00:05:32.540,00:05:35.043,"Silly-spooky drum roll, please."
00:05:36.210,00:05:39.339,Boo-da-doo!
00:05:42.800,00:05:45.053,Let's go open the door.
00:05:54.103,00:05:57.315,"Oh, Violet, here we come!"
00:05:57.690,00:05:59.317,Spooky!
00:06:02.820,00:06:03.946,And silly.
00:06:04.405,00:06:05.782,Stick with us.
00:06:06.032,00:06:09.160,"Ready or not, here we come."
00:06:10.787,00:06:12.538,Charlie!
00:06:12.622,00:06:14.374,Red!
00:06:14.874,00:06:17.543,Come and find me.
00:06:22.757,00:06:24.258,She must be near here.
00:06:25.510,00:06:28.930,"Charlie, there's something spooky about this painting."
00:06:29.806,00:06:32.934,Those eyes are following us everywhere.
00:06:33.684,00:06:36.729,This painting does seem spooky.
00:06:37.313,00:06:39.774,But maybe if we look closely it won't be.
00:06:48.741,00:06:50.743,More Silly Faces?
00:06:54.038,00:06:57.708,"See, Red? It wasn't so spooky after all."
00:06:58.751,00:07:01.546,"Oh, Charlie!"
00:07:01.629,00:07:03.756,"Oh, Red!"
00:07:03.840,00:07:06.050,Come and find me.
00:07:07.135,00:07:08.261,This way!
00:07:12.348,00:07:14.517,Look! More squiggle-webs!
00:07:16.894,00:07:18.563,Up the stairs.
00:07:20.648,00:07:23.609,Violet's going to be right up-- Yuh-oh!
00:07:24.402,00:07:26.362,The rest of the stairs are missing!
00:07:26.612,00:07:28.281,We can't get to Violet!
00:07:30.908,00:07:33.286,Our story's getting stickier.
00:07:33.619,00:07:35.580,We need to fix the stairs.
00:07:39.959,00:07:41.252,"Yes, yes, yes!"
00:07:42.670,00:07:46.257,"Just a little sticky magic, and now we have..."
00:07:50.470,00:07:52.138,musical stairs!
00:07:52.221,00:07:53.681,Yeh-hess!
00:08:06.736,00:08:07.945,Brilliant.
00:08:08.029,00:08:10.781,"Nice tune, seekers."
00:08:19.499,00:08:22.668,Squiggle-webs! I bet we're really close now.
00:08:24.337,00:08:26.172,More squiggle-webs.
00:08:26.422,00:08:29.383,Violet has to be hiding in here somewhere.
00:08:38.351,00:08:39.352,Baby again.
00:08:42.855,00:08:45.399,Maybe behind this grandfather clock?
00:08:52.406,00:08:55.076,You mean grandmother clock.
00:08:56.160,00:08:57.828,Still no Violet.
00:09:01.832,00:09:03.960,She must be behind here.
00:09:05.086,00:09:06.254,Hello!
00:09:08.005,00:09:09.715,Hey! You're not Violet!
00:09:12.677,00:09:15.179,We just keep finding Silly Faces.
00:09:15.471,00:09:21.352,"The spider, two in the painting, a cat, one in the clock, and one playing the saxophone."
00:09:21.435,00:09:22.645,But no Violet.
00:09:22.728,00:09:24.897,We've looked everywhere.
00:09:25.147,00:09:28.526,Colour me purple. I'm frustrated!
00:09:29.151,00:09:31.696,"Charlie, look! More squiggle-webs!"
00:09:31.779,00:09:32.822,On the bookcase!
00:09:35.324,00:09:37.243,There's something behind it!
00:09:48.963,00:09:50.965,-Ya-ya-yoinks! -What is that?
00:09:51.048,00:09:54.260,It's coming closer! I'm spooked!
00:10:00.850,00:10:03.769,Not if we are the ones telling this story.
00:10:04.270,00:10:09.942,"It might seem spooky, but maybe if we look closely, it won't be?"
00:10:10.026,00:10:12.236,It's time for something big to happen.
00:10:12.320,00:10:13.529,"Red-dy, Red?"
00:10:14.113,00:10:15.656,Red-dy.
00:10:18.618,00:10:19.452,Wait.
00:10:19.535,00:10:21.120,That's not spooky.
00:10:21.621,00:10:23.205,That's Violet!
00:10:26.000,00:10:27.335,We found Violet!
00:10:29.837,00:10:32.757,And there's one more spooky-silly surprise!
00:10:38.137,00:10:39.597,All right!
00:10:40.640,00:10:42.725,-Gonna be a party! -Party!
00:10:43.851,00:10:44.852,"Look, Charlie!"
00:10:44.935,00:10:47.730,I'm dancing with a ghost!
00:10:50.733,00:10:53.027,We finally found Violet!
00:10:53.110,00:10:55.613,And it was silly and spooky.
00:10:55.696,00:10:57.114,The end.
00:11:00.076,00:11:01.410,Or is it?
00:11:05.539,00:11:09.001,What do you think happens next?
00:11:11.671,00:11:14.382,You've got a story to create!
00:11:29.438,00:11:30.648,"Oh, hi!"
00:11:31.482,00:11:34.110,I'm pretending I have a superpower.
00:11:34.193,00:11:38.030,The power to jump really high!
00:11:46.455,00:11:49.083,You know where we could really have superpowers?
00:11:56.340,00:12:01.679,I feel a story coming on!
00:12:02.888,00:12:04.598,Let's get this story started!

00:12:35.963,00:12:39.842,"EPISODE TITLE Once upon a time, you and I..."
00:12:41.719,00:12:47.600,"were in Colorforms City Park, waiting for someone to need help from..."

00:12:55.191,00:13:00.362,"And while we're waiting, me and my pet, Klunk, are going to play our favourite game."
00:13:06.410,00:13:08.829,"Fantastic dunk, Klunk."
00:13:12.958,00:13:19.840,"And speaking of super, does anyone need the Mighty Charlie?"
00:13:24.637,00:13:25.471,No?
00:13:27.056,00:13:28.390,Okay.
00:13:28.974,00:13:31.268,"Ready, Klunk? Let's play again!"
00:13:37.191,00:13:40.611,What's that noise? Is it a bird? A plane?

00:14:08.138,00:14:11.892,Maybe the Silly Faces are the villains in this super-story.
00:14:12.309,00:14:13.811,I have to go and help Klunk!
00:14:14.311,00:14:16.480,This is a job for...

00:14:42.923,00:14:47.928,Are those Silly Villains trying to stop the Mighty Charlie from saving Klunk?
00:14:49.179,00:14:52.016,Our story's getting sticky.
00:14:52.224,00:14:54.935,How can I get out of this net and save Klunk?
00:15:03.903,00:15:05.654,-We need-- -Me?

00:15:37.311,00:15:40.189,make things out of other things.
00:15:41.148,00:15:43.525,It's a shield!
00:15:44.234,00:15:46.111,And...
00:15:46.195,00:15:47.488,I a...

00:16:00.209,00:16:02.586,"Can you help me out of here first, super team?"
00:16:03.963,00:16:04.964,I a baby!
00:16:05.047,00:16:09.301,Time to make another thing out of other things!
00:16:09.385,00:16:11.595,"A spatula, and a telescope..."
00:16:11.887,00:16:13.097,And stick!
00:16:13.472,00:16:15.849,It's a spatulascope!
00:16:26.485,00:16:27.778,"Thanks, super team."
00:16:28.153,00:16:30.322,Now let's go save...
00:16:30.406,00:16:31.949,Klunk!
00:16:33.117,00:16:34.159,Klunk!
00:16:37.955,00:16:41.250,The Silly Villains are taking Klunk into their lair!
00:16:42.292,00:16:45.295,That's a fancy word for where villains live.
00:16:45.879,00:16:47.631,We need to save Klunk.
00:16:50.426,00:16:51.844,How do we get there?
00:16:56.932,00:17:01.061,What can we create to get the whole super team to the Silly Villains' lair?
00:17:05.774,00:17:08.610,What about a plane? We could fly there!
00:17:08.694,00:17:10.195,I like it!
00:17:14.950,00:17:20.164,"We can make the plane look like me, the Mighty Charlie!"
00:17:24.626,00:17:28.881,Let's shake it up!
00:17:34.887,00:17:35.846,Okay.
00:17:36.305,00:17:39.058,The top of the plane should look like my hat.
00:17:40.225,00:17:41.894,Which shape should we use?
00:17:43.979,00:17:46.106,Yipperoo! The triangle.
00:17:47.816,00:17:50.986,Now we need the body of the plane.
00:17:54.156,00:17:56.033,Which shape should we use?
00:17:58.619,00:18:00.704,The large semicircle.
00:18:00.788,00:18:02.372,Yes! Yes!
00:18:02.456,00:18:04.541,That is my face.
00:18:06.251,00:18:09.671,Now let's use this big rectangle for my body.
00:18:12.216,00:18:15.052,Now let's add a super-cape. Like mine!
00:18:16.929,00:18:18.680,Which shape looks like a cape?
00:18:21.183,00:18:22.976,This trapezium will work.
00:18:24.728,00:18:26.230,And now...
00:18:27.773,00:18:29.608,super boo-da-doo!
00:18:31.110,00:18:34.196,"Yes, yes, yes! That's my plane."
00:18:40.911,00:18:42.162,-Ah-mazing! -Brilliant!
00:18:43.455,00:18:46.125,Let's go save Klunk!
00:18:47.876,00:18:49.962,I drive! I a baby!
00:19:03.350,00:19:04.476,I a baby?
00:19:04.768,00:19:08.105,What? Super Baby pulled off the steering wheel!
00:19:08.605,00:19:10.566,Now we can't steer the plane!
00:19:13.610,00:19:15.237,I a baby!
00:19:15.320,00:19:19.158,And we are super-swervy!
00:19:20.409,00:19:22.286,Hello! What you doing?
00:19:22.452,00:19:25.414,Miss Weather! We're swerving all over the place!
00:19:25.998,00:19:28.041,Okay. I can help with that.
00:19:28.125,00:19:29.668,I mean...
00:19:29.751,00:19:31.753,Wonder Weather can!
00:19:31.837,00:19:34.673,Wonder Weather cloud mitt!
00:19:49.229,00:19:50.397,Wowser!
00:19:50.480,00:19:52.107,Phewf-a-doof!
00:19:52.191,00:19:54.735,"Nice catch, Wonder Weather. Thanks."
00:19:54.818,00:19:57.905,"Sunny skies, Charl-- Klunk!"
00:19:58.155,00:19:59.156,Klunk!
00:20:01.158,00:20:05.078,"We're so close now, but we can't steer our plane!"
00:20:05.329,00:20:07.414,How can we rescue Klunk now?
00:20:07.873,00:20:09.458,Colour me blue.
00:20:09.750,00:20:12.252,I'm super-sad.
00:20:12.878,00:20:15.047,Is this how our story ends?
00:20:17.216,00:20:19.468,"We are heroes, Mighty Charlie."
00:20:19.718,00:20:22.179,Do heroes give up when they're sad?
00:20:22.888,00:20:23.764,No.
00:20:24.973,00:20:27.559,It's time for something big to happen.
00:20:30.312,00:20:32.648,I thought you'd never ask.
00:20:40.948,00:20:42.241,"Thanks, Wonder Weather!"
00:20:45.702,00:20:50.749,"All right, you Silly Villains, the super team is here to save Klunk!"
00:20:51.416,00:20:52.251,What?
00:20:53.877,00:20:55.379,I a baby?
00:20:58.882,00:21:00.801,Alley-oop!
00:21:02.594,00:21:04.721,"-Hey, Klunk-a-dunk! -Hey, Klunk-a-dunk!"
00:21:04.805,00:21:07.015,"-Hey, hey! -What?"
00:21:07.099,00:21:08.684,"Klunk, you're okay?"
00:21:09.226,00:21:11.061,And you're playing Klunk-a-dunk?
00:21:12.312,00:21:14.273,So you're not villains?
00:21:18.277,00:21:21.947,But... we did take your ball.
00:21:22.197,00:21:24.157,And Klunk followed it.
00:21:25.367,00:21:27.536,And he taught us Klunk-a-dunk.
00:21:27.619,00:21:29.079,We love it!
00:21:29.162,00:21:30.706,I understand.
00:21:30.789,00:21:33.542,Klunk-a-dunk is super-fun to play.
00:21:35.002,00:21:37.254,"I'm glad you're having fun, Klunk."
00:21:42.050,00:21:43.010,-What? -Yeah!
00:21:46.179,00:21:49.099,I a... baby!
00:21:50.017,00:21:50.976,Look out!
00:21:51.476,00:21:52.602,Watch out!
00:22:01.361,00:22:03.113,"Way to go, super team."
00:22:03.196,00:22:05.574,-Yeah! -I a baby!
00:22:06.700,00:22:08.160,The end.
00:22:11.330,00:22:12.539,Or is it?
00:22:19.212,00:22:21.465,What would happen in that story?
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.617,Hot sand. Yikes!
00:23:03.006,00:23:04.883,Hey! That tickles!
00:00:15.724,00:00:17.892,Whooo!
00:00:21.479,00:00:23.356,Ya-ya-yoiks!
00:00:33.283,00:00:36.953,Hey! Do you know where we could really be spooky?
00:00:49.591,00:00:52.302,a story coming on!
00:00:53.595,00:00:55.430,Let's get this story started!
00:01:24.000,00:01:29.881,Let's get this spooky-- and silly story started.
00:01:30.089,00:01:35.345,"Once upon a time, it was a beautiful day."
00:01:35.428,00:01:37.222,The sun was shining...
00:01:50.819,00:01:52.278,How can I help?
00:01:59.244,00:02:03.748,Let's start with the moon.
00:02:34.779,00:02:37.490,"-Hi, Charlie. -Are you ready to go to..."
00:02:51.629,00:02:53.882,Vio-let's get going!
00:02:56.676,00:03:00.054,See? It's spook-tastic. Hee-hee-yeah!
00:03:01.764,00:03:03.433,Oooh.
00:03:07.437,00:03:09.022,I'll hide first.
00:03:51.356,00:03:53.441,-Dello! -Ya-ya-yoinks!
00:04:08.456,00:04:09.749,Hee-hee-yeah!
00:04:45.743,00:04:47.620,Ha ha ha ha! Hee hee hee!
00:05:00.800,00:05:02.427,Yipperoo!
00:05:02.510,00:05:04.971,"Now, last but not least, the handle."
00:05:05.054,00:05:07.974,Looks like we need one...
00:05:14.063,00:05:18.067,But we don't have circles. Which shapes can we use?
00:05:54.103,00:05:57.607,"Oh, Violet! Here we come!"
00:06:02.820,00:06:04.322,And silly.
00:06:04.405,00:06:05.948,Stick with us.
00:06:14.457,00:06:17.126,Come and find me.
00:06:22.548,00:06:24.759,She must be near here.
00:06:29.806,00:06:32.809,Those eyes are following us everywhere.
00:06:40.483,00:06:42.151,Hmm.
00:06:44.487,00:06:45.780,-Hello! -Aah!
00:06:45.863,00:06:48.658,-Ha ha ha! -Ohh.
00:06:48.741,00:06:51.702,-More Silly Faces? -Yay!
00:07:01.712,00:07:03.631,"Oh, Red!"
00:07:07.135,00:07:08.469,This way!
00:07:24.402,00:07:26.529,The rest of the stairs are missing!
00:07:30.908,00:07:33.536,Our story's getting stickier.
00:07:50.303,00:07:52.221,...musical stairs!
00:08:10.865,00:08:14.785,But you still haven't found me.

00:13:26.096,00:13:27.306,What's that?
00:13:31.268,00:13:32.436,And watch this.

00:14:02.341,00:14:03.509,Klunk!

00:14:10.683,00:14:13.686,Fee-fi-fo-fum!
00:14:15.354,00:14:16.772,There's Violet and Red!

00:14:46.927,00:14:49.513,So big that you could...
00:14:50.556,00:14:52.933,push us on the swings?
00:14:54.518,00:14:56.729,I can give you giant pushes!
00:14:57.021,00:14:58.814,Small me couldn't do that.
00:14:59.315,00:15:01.692,Then Vio-let's get swinging!
00:15:01.775,00:15:04.987,Fee-fi-fo-fum!
00:15:05.321,00:15:12.328,I'm a giant and-- Hello!
00:15:13.871,00:15:15.331,"Sorry, Grandma."

00:15:21.170,00:15:23.088,Double yewps! Sorry!
00:15:23.172,00:15:25.841,"Charlie, watch out! You're going to trip on..."
00:15:28.552,00:15:30.429,The swing set.
00:15:35.684,00:15:37.686,I giantly messed things up.
00:15:38.145,00:15:39.480,Colour me blue.
00:15:39.730,00:15:41.857,I'm so giantly sad!
00:15:42.858,00:15:44.902,I ruined the playground.
00:15:49.782,00:15:51.408,What should I do next?
00:15:51.784,00:15:54.286,Should I just stop playing and go home?
00:15:56.372,00:15:57.206,Or...
00:15:57.498,00:16:01.794,what if you build a new swing set and we can all keep playing together?
00:16:02.169,00:16:04.463,What she said!
00:16:04.922,00:16:05.756,Really?
00:16:06.215,00:16:09.843,"You want to keep playing, even if I'm a giant?"
00:16:09.927,00:16:11.136,"Oh, yeah!"
00:16:11.679,00:16:12.596,Okay.
00:16:13.180,00:16:15.432,Will you help me make a new swing set?
00:16:16.600,00:16:20.562,Let's shake it up!
00:16:36.996,00:16:38.998,How about this semicircle?
00:16:41.458,00:16:43.419,Two swings for two friends.
00:16:43.669,00:16:47.214,Now we need something to hold up the seats so they can swing.
00:16:48.966,00:16:50.551,What shape can we use?
00:16:53.595,00:16:56.515,These thinny-thin rectangles...
00:16:57.349,00:17:00.185,are perfect for holding up our swings.
00:17:00.269,00:17:03.647,And where should we hang these swings?
00:17:05.232,00:17:07.776,We could use the long rectangle...
00:17:08.444,00:17:09.903,or...
00:17:09.987,00:17:13.615,let's get creative and make this story even better!
00:17:13.699,00:17:17.953,How about we hang these swings on me!
00:17:18.287,00:17:20.330,And these curved shapes can be...

00:18:31.401,00:18:34.363,Everybody off!
00:18:45.958,00:18:46.917,Sorry.
00:18:47.126,00:18:48.001,We're okay.
00:18:49.378,00:18:51.046,I couldn't stop giggling!
00:18:59.972,00:19:02.724,Our story is getting stickier!
00:19:06.395,00:19:09.106,How about we go to the big field?
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.612,"Yeah, I love colour tag!"
00:19:15.696,00:19:17.197,-Colour tag! -I like it!
00:19:17.531,00:19:21.326,A field has lots of room for a giant like me to play.
00:19:22.119,00:19:25.164,All aboard the giant bus!
00:19:34.173,00:19:36.008,I'm a giant bus...

00:19:51.481,00:19:52.900,I see...

00:19:57.404,00:19:59.406,Let me know if you see something that's yellow.

00:20:26.099,00:20:27.142,I'm okay.
00:20:27.226,00:20:29.937,"-You're next, Charlie! -Yes!"
00:20:30.020,00:20:32.481,I giantly love this game!

00:20:44.660,00:20:59.007,You're going to knock over the-- Yikes!
00:21:01.468,00:21:03.679,"Oh, look at me!"
00:21:07.975,00:21:11.561,Maybe colour tag wasn't the best idea either.
00:21:13.605,00:21:14.564,Yuh-oh.
00:21:15.190,00:21:17.776,I giantly messed things up again.
00:21:18.944,00:21:21.905,It's just too hard to play with me when I'm this giant.
00:21:26.159,00:21:28.078,Is this how our story ends?
00:21:31.498,00:21:34.543,Not if we're the ones telling this story.

00:21:37.546,00:21:39.631,"Or, actually, something small."
00:21:40.966,00:21:47.514,"Once upon a time, I was small again, and I couldn't wait to play with my friends in Colorforms City Park."
00:21:52.644,00:21:53.770,Charlie!
00:21:55.480,00:21:57.316,You're small again.

00:23:17.437,00:00:14.764,Subtitles translated by: Whee!
00:00:20.311,00:00:21.646,Whoa!

00:04:29.769,00:04:33.773,Chicken wants snow to ski down Birthday Cake Mountain?
00:04:33.856,00:04:35.817,OK...
00:04:55.253,00:04:57.880,"-Charlie? -snow, then wind?"

00:07:33.035,00:07:35.705,I don't think that's what they asked for.
00:07:41.252,00:07:43.629,"What should we do next, storyteller?"
00:07:51.012,00:07:56.601,Weather Charlie and Weather Klunk are on their way to press the yellow button and call Miss Weather.
