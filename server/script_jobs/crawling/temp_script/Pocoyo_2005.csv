00:00:14.720,00:00:15.760,Elly!
00:00:25.960,00:00:27.360,Loula!
00:00:31.800,00:00:33.320,Sleepy Bird!
00:00:45.680,00:00:53.360,"where Pocoyo and his friends live, and Pocoyo and Pato should just be settling down to..."
00:00:58.120,00:01:04.040,"Hmm, as I was saying, they should be settling down to bed."
00:01:22.720,00:01:26.720,Do you know what we usually do when it gets late?
00:01:29.640,00:01:30.760,Quack!
00:01:33.640,00:01:38.880,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what he needs to do next?
00:01:47.000,00:01:49.280,It's bedtime.
00:01:50.800,00:01:51.680,No.
00:01:53.040,00:01:56.560,I'm afraid Pocoyo doesn't want to go to sleep.
00:01:56.760,00:02:00.200,"But, Pocoyo, everyone needs sleep."
00:02:01.520,00:02:03.440,You don't need sleep?
00:02:03.800,00:02:05.360,Are you sure?
00:02:14.640,00:02:15.880,Quack!
00:02:18.880,00:02:24.040,that he needs his sleep and your airplane sounds are keeping him awake.
00:02:29.160,00:02:31.960,"Oh, how nice, Pocoyo."
00:02:49.400,00:02:50.880,"All right, then."
00:02:51.040,00:02:52.960,That's better.
00:02:54.480,00:02:55.800,Good night.
00:03:07.360,00:03:08.920,What's this now?
00:03:10.400,00:03:11.560,Quack!
00:03:14.640,00:03:15.480,Ah.
00:03:46.680,00:03:47.520,Quack!
00:03:53.360,00:03:54.440,Quack!
00:04:07.000,00:04:09.800,"for building block towers, Pocoyo."
00:04:10.000,00:04:12.960,You can build another tomorrow if you like.
00:04:19.000,00:04:20.400,Good night.
00:04:31.520,00:04:32.640,Pocoyo.
00:04:32.760,00:04:39.760,"Um, Pocoyo, bedtime isn't the time for playing with trains either."
00:04:54.800,00:04:55.880,Quack!
00:05:04.440,00:05:07.200,He's finally down to sleep.
00:05:07.400,00:05:10.640,Now you can get some sleep yourself.
00:05:17.160,00:05:19.680,"Oh, no. What's the matter, Pato?"
00:05:20.000,00:05:21.920,"Can't sleep now, eh?"
00:05:24.080,00:05:26.920,"Well, maybe I can help."
00:05:27.240,00:05:30.160,Perhaps a little soothing music?
00:05:30.320,00:05:31.320,Let's see now.
00:05:31.440,00:05:32.440,Um...
00:05:42.800,00:05:44.480,"Hmm, that didn't work."
00:05:45.800,00:05:50.960,I know. Can all of you sing Pato the lullaby with me?
00:06:03.640,00:06:09.000,"La-la-la La-la-la, la-la-la."
00:06:09.480,00:06:17.680,La-la-la It looks like our friends are finally asleep.
00:06:21.480,00:06:26.320,"Good night, Pocoyo, and good night to you too."
00:06:26.720,00:06:30.080,"Good night, all, and hooray for Pocoyo."
00:06:33.320,00:06:36.120,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:06:49.160,00:06:50.760,Pato!
00:06:55.320,00:06:56.360,Elly!
00:07:06.560,00:07:07.960,Loula!
00:07:12.400,00:07:13.920,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:26.000,00:07:27.200,Hi.
00:07:31.400,00:07:35.720,"Wow, that's quite a system you've got going there."
00:07:36.000,00:07:40.840,"Pocoyo passes the bricks up, and Pato puts them on top."
00:07:41.040,00:07:44.160,"Well, your teamwork is really paying off."
00:07:44.360,00:07:46.600,It looks fantastic.
00:07:46.680,00:07:51.080,Can any of you guess what Pocoyo and Pato are building?
00:08:14.400,00:08:16.480,"Oh, dear, Pocoyo."
00:08:16.560,00:08:17.880,What are you going to do?
00:08:18.000,00:08:22.640,"Pato needs another brick, but you've already used them all up."
00:08:25.440,00:08:30.280,"Oh, oh, oh, Pocoyo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea."
00:09:03.320,00:09:07.320,there's no reason to get so angry with one another.
00:09:07.840,00:09:09.960,It's no one's fault.
00:09:10.400,00:09:15.000,"Pato wanted more bricks, and Pocoyo was only trying to help."
00:09:15.120,00:09:17.000,"Oh, come on, now."
00:09:17.280,00:09:18.800,Make friends.
00:09:20.200,00:09:21.280,No.
00:09:36.840,00:09:39.080,"Pocoyo, Pato."
00:10:12.920,00:10:16.440,Maybe she can sort out this ridiculous situation.
00:11:12.480,00:11:13.480,Mine.
00:12:23.120,00:12:25.320,This really has got out of hand.
00:12:53.000,00:12:55.760,what Elly thinks they should do?
00:13:12.680,00:13:17.360,that being friendly is a lot more fun than being angry.
00:13:17.480,00:13:20.280,Hooray for Pocoyo and Pato.
00:13:21.440,00:13:22.720,Bye-bye.
00:13:31.480,00:13:33.080,Pato!
00:13:37.640,00:13:38.680,Elly!
00:13:48.880,00:13:50.280,Loula!
00:13:54.720,00:13:56.240,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:10.600,00:14:12.080,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:14:12.560,00:14:13.560,Huh.
00:14:17.080,00:14:18.280,"Oh, dear."
00:14:18.400,00:14:22.440,It looks like Pocoyo is in a bad mood today.
00:14:23.080,00:14:24.960,"Cheer up, Pocoyo."
00:14:29.000,00:14:34.440,"Oh, look, Pocoyo, here comes someone who'll put a smile back on your face."
00:14:35.000,00:14:36.680,"Take a look, Pocoyo."
00:14:36.920,00:14:38.280,It's your friend...
00:14:38.520,00:14:45.200,"Hmm, can any of you tell Pocoyo which one of his friends is coming?"
00:14:45.560,00:14:46.680,Mm.
00:14:56.200,00:15:00.400,"I'm afraid Pocoyo is feeling a bit unhappy, Octopus."
00:15:00.640,00:15:01.920,Can you help?
00:15:32.960,00:15:35.480,You've cheered Pocoyo up.
00:15:35.600,00:15:37.040,Good job.
00:15:50.480,00:15:55.200,"Elly, what beautiful dancing."
00:16:16.520,00:16:20.760,Pocoyo's laughing interrupted her beautiful dancing.
00:16:20.880,00:16:22.800,She could do with cheering up.
00:16:45.160,00:16:47.240,"Well done, Octopus."
00:16:47.360,00:16:50.600,Elly's back to her old self again.
00:16:52.360,00:16:54.160,"Ah, and here's Pato."
00:17:08.840,00:17:12.720,Your hat has fallen down over your eyes.
00:17:20.360,00:17:22.040,That old problem.
00:17:25.400,00:17:26.840,"Oh, dear."
00:17:26.960,00:17:32.280,"Pocoyo, Pato thinks you and Elly are laughing at him."
00:17:32.440,00:17:33.760,Do you see?
00:17:38.320,00:17:40.880,"Oh, that's nice, Pocoyo and Elly."
00:17:41.000,00:17:45.560,But Pato still doesn't seem to be back to his normal self.
00:17:46.080,00:17:47.240,Hm.
00:17:47.600,00:17:50.160,What could cheer Pato up?
00:17:50.360,00:17:58.400,Can any of you tell Pocoyo and Elly what or who might be able to cheer Pato up?
00:18:37.680,00:18:39.200,to make him giggle.
00:18:42.240,00:18:44.000,A feather? Umm.
00:18:44.200,00:18:47.000,How will that make Pato laugh?
00:18:57.960,00:19:00.040,Pato is laughing at last.
00:19:01.600,00:19:04.760,So tickling Pato made him laugh.
00:19:04.880,00:19:07.600,"What a brilliant idea, Octopus."
00:19:08.920,00:19:11.880,"But I must say, that wouldn't work on me."
00:19:24.240,00:19:26.080,"That does rather tickle, doesn't it?"
00:19:26.200,00:19:27.960,"All right, all right, Octopus."
00:19:28.080,00:19:29.800,I think-- I think that's enough.
00:19:29.920,00:19:30.920,"Thank you, Octopus."
00:19:31.040,00:19:33.160,"Stop it. Stop it, please!"
00:19:33.280,00:19:34.320,Please.
00:19:46.360,00:19:54.000,even if-- Even-- Even if you are unhappy to start with.
00:19:54.240,00:19:59.040,Hooray-- Hooray for Octopus and for Pocoyo.
00:19:59.320,00:20:02.720,See you-- See you next time. Bye-bye!
00:20:14.720,00:20:16.320,Pato!
00:20:20.920,00:20:21.960,Elly!
00:20:32.160,00:20:33.560,Loula!
00:20:38.000,00:20:39.520,Sleepy Bird!
00:21:02.400,00:21:03.520,Box.
00:21:06.160,00:21:09.720,What a wonderful thing a box is.
00:21:10.120,00:21:15.240,"Why, there's so much you can do with it, so many things a box can be."
00:21:35.760,00:21:38.080,"What are you pretending it is, Pocoyo?"
00:21:38.200,00:21:39.480,"Beep, beep!"
00:21:43.000,00:21:46.360,What is Pocoyo pretending the box is?
00:21:58.400,00:22:00.360,Box... Car.
00:22:11.080,00:22:13.040,Box... Car.
00:22:29.120,00:22:34.720,"Your box car is moving all on its own, like a real car."
00:22:55.720,00:22:59.640,It looks like Elly has a good idea for what the box could be.
00:23:00.480,00:23:02.040,It's a table.
00:23:08.960,00:23:11.840,But an unusual sort of table.
00:23:13.560,00:23:15.800,The box is off again.
00:23:56.320,00:24:00.920,And it looks like Pato has another idea for what the box could be.
00:24:05.240,00:24:10.720,"He's going to step on the box to reach that lovely, juicy apple."
00:24:12.000,00:24:13.320,No!
00:24:28.720,00:24:33.280,"Well, I'm afraid this box isn't like most boxes."
00:24:33.960,00:24:36.720,Do you know why the box keeps running away?
00:24:39.400,00:24:41.280,Let me give you a clue.
00:24:42.000,00:24:45.880,There's something inside the box.
00:24:48.120,00:24:55.240,"It is very, very friendly, with floppy ears and a very waggy tail."
00:24:55.360,00:24:57.440,Can you guess what it is?
00:25:16.760,00:25:18.320,What about all of you?
00:25:18.440,00:25:25.760,"Can any of you tell our friends what, or who, is inside the box and making it move?"
00:25:38.440,00:25:39.920,Loula?
00:25:54.560,00:25:59.160,"You know, I think Loula really likes that box."
00:26:01.600,00:26:07.840,I wonder if there isn't something you could do with the box so that she could spend more time in it.
00:26:25.000,00:26:31.680,"a box can be many things to many people, and to many dogs, too, for that matter."
00:26:35.520,00:26:37.440,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:26:37.560,00:26:39.280,Hooray for boxes!
00:26:39.400,00:26:42.280,"And hooray for you too, Loula."
00:00:08.600,00:00:10.120,Pato!
00:00:14.880,00:00:15.880,Elly!
00:00:49.280,00:00:50.200,"Look, he's..."
00:00:50.320,00:00:51.120,Hmm...
00:00:51.200,00:00:52.720,What is he doing?
00:00:52.840,00:00:54.080,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:00:54.240,00:00:55.040,Hi.
00:01:07.640,00:01:09.360,He's drumming.
00:01:09.480,00:01:12.440,"It makes a fine noise, doesn't it?"
00:01:15.800,00:01:20.160,"Yes, the drum is a wonderful instrument."
00:01:20.360,00:01:21.960,"Oh, my."
00:01:22.080,00:01:25.440,"Yes, that is quite a big sound, Pocoyo."
00:01:25.560,00:01:28.520,"Yes, indeed, Pocoyo!"
00:01:28.640,00:01:29.560,Pocoyo!
00:01:29.680,00:01:31.440,Poocooyoo!
00:01:38.520,00:01:40.360,Drum! Loud!
00:01:43.400,00:01:44.840,Perhaps you could...
00:01:44.960,00:01:46.720,Pocoyo?
00:01:47.440,00:01:49.160,Show friends.
00:02:13.040,00:02:14.480,Sleepy bird. Drum.
00:02:25.960,00:02:29.760,Poooocooooyoooo!
00:02:33.000,00:02:37.880,Uh! I believe Sleepy Bird was taking a nap.
00:02:38.120,00:02:46.080,"I'm not sure she wants to, uh, do any drumming right now or hear any, I'm afraid."
00:03:02.200,00:03:03.400,"Oh, here's Elly."
00:03:03.520,00:03:06.960,And how lovely. She's dancing.
00:03:27.000,00:03:29.600,"Are you all right, Elly?"
00:03:32.200,00:03:34.160,"Um, Pocoyo!"
00:03:34.320,00:03:38.360,I don't think Elly wants to drum right now either.
00:03:38.480,00:03:39.720,She's dancing.
00:03:58.240,00:03:59.520,Quack! Quack!
00:03:59.640,00:04:00.600,Pato.
00:04:00.720,00:04:01.960,Drum.
00:04:02.080,00:04:03.520,Drum!
00:04:15.120,00:04:16.400,Quack! Quack! Quack!
00:04:18.920,00:04:19.840,Drum.
00:04:28.240,00:04:29.080,Pato.
00:04:38.120,00:04:41.880,I'm afraid Pato doesn't want to drum either.
00:04:51.520,00:04:55.280,"Oh, I'm afraid Pocoyo's a bit upset."
00:05:02.080,00:05:03.600,Pocoyo?
00:05:03.720,00:05:04.920,Pocoyooo.
00:05:07.640,00:05:19.440,"I know you wanted to drum, but sometimes not everyone wants to do exactly the same thing you do at exactly the same time you want to do it."
00:05:23.400,00:05:30.360,"But maybe if you wait a bit and check back with them later, - when they're finished with... - Drum."
00:05:33.360,00:05:36.320,Why don't you drum a little now?
00:05:36.440,00:05:38.760,There's not really anyone around to upset...
00:05:38.840,00:05:42.680,I-I mean to appreciate it at the moment.
00:05:48.360,00:05:49.840,"Oh, look, Pocoyo!"
00:05:49.960,00:05:50.800,It's...
00:05:52.360,00:05:54.040,"Um, Pocoyo."
00:05:54.240,00:05:56.560,If I might stop you for a moment.
00:06:08.520,00:06:12.360,"I think your friends want to do some drumming now, Pocoyo."
00:06:13.000,00:06:15.800,"Elly, Pato, drum!"
00:06:27.760,00:06:30.720,"Or in this case, loud things..."
00:06:30.880,00:06:33.880,Come to those who learn to wait!
00:06:34.000,00:06:37.120,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:06:38.000,00:06:41.000,See you soon!
00:06:49.640,00:06:51.160,Pato!
00:06:55.800,00:06:56.800,Elly!
00:07:07.040,00:07:08.280,Loula!
00:07:12.840,00:07:14.240,Sleepy bird!
00:07:28.280,00:07:30.160,They're out for a ride.
00:07:30.240,00:07:31.440,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:07:31.560,00:07:33.160,"Hello, Elly."
00:07:34.640,00:07:43.080,There's nothing like a relaxing ride on a nice day to make you feel wonderful and bring friends together.
00:07:50.280,00:07:51.480,Oh.
00:07:54.080,00:08:01.000,It seems like Elly and Pocoyo's relaxing little ride together is becoming a race.
00:08:01.400,00:08:03.480,And there's Pato.
00:08:04.480,00:08:06.120,But where's he going?
00:08:06.240,00:08:07.200,Aha!
00:08:07.320,00:08:09.400,There he is. I see.
00:08:09.520,00:08:14.040,Pato wants Elly and Pocoyo to have a real race.
00:08:14.280,00:08:15.920,How exciting!
00:08:16.040,00:08:17.280,"Gather round, everyone."
00:08:17.600,00:08:23.320,Elly and Pocoyo are going to have a race to see who's faster.
00:08:25.840,00:08:28.520,I think Pato wants to get things going.
00:08:28.640,00:08:29.440,Quack!
00:08:31.520,00:08:33.680,"to get the race started, Pato?"
00:08:40.000,00:08:43.840,"Yes, you say, ready, steady..."
00:08:43.960,00:08:47.040,"And then what comes next, Pato?"
00:08:47.640,00:08:48.960,"Oh, dear."
00:08:49.080,00:08:51.720,Pato can't remember what comes next.
00:08:51.840,00:08:55.640,Can any of you help Pato to get the race started?
00:08:55.760,00:08:57.440,Say it with me.
00:08:57.600,00:08:59.040,Ready...
00:08:59.160,00:09:00.600,Steady...
00:09:07.320,00:09:09.320,Well done. Isn't it thrilling?
00:09:09.440,00:09:11.800,Pocoyo and Elly are neck and neck!
00:09:12.440,00:09:16.360,"Oh, and I think they've woken Sleepy Bird."
00:09:17.680,00:09:18.720,"Oh, and look!"
00:09:18.840,00:09:21.680,It seems as though she wants to join the race as well.
00:09:23.920,00:09:27.320,"Oh, it doesn't look like she can go very fast."
00:09:30.120,00:09:33.680,It looks as though Elly is taking the lead.
00:09:37.000,00:09:39.280,"Oh, no, what bad luck!"
00:09:39.400,00:09:42.480,Elly appears to be stuck in the sand.
00:09:43.960,00:09:49.480,"And there goes Pocoyo, leaving poor Elly in the dust..."
00:09:49.600,00:09:51.600,I-I-I mean sand!
00:09:52.960,00:09:54.120,Wait a moment.
00:09:54.240,00:09:56.840,Looks like Elly has an idea.
00:09:56.960,00:09:59.240,What's she going to do?
00:09:59.600,00:10:02.040,She's pulling herself out!
00:10:02.160,00:10:03.200,"Pull, Elly!"
00:10:03.320,00:10:04.640,Pull!
00:10:07.400,00:10:09.400,She did it.
00:10:14.200,00:10:16.560,And she's off again.
00:10:19.000,00:10:20.520,"Nice going, Pocoyo."
00:10:20.640,00:10:22.640,You're way ahead.
00:10:23.520,00:10:27.200,"You're working up quite a sweat, aren't you?"
00:10:34.720,00:10:36.080,This is very strange.
00:10:36.200,00:10:38.480,"What are you doing now, Pocoyo?"
00:10:38.600,00:10:39.720,Ice cream.
00:10:42.240,00:10:44.040,in the middle of the race?
00:10:44.160,00:10:50.360,"Well, I must say, you must be feeling pretty confident if you're eating ice cream."
00:10:55.960,00:10:57.480,"Oh, Elly."
00:10:59.160,00:11:02.920,"Well, you'd better get going if you want to win the race, Pocoyo."
00:11:04.600,00:11:05.920,And he's off again!
00:11:06.040,00:11:08.160,Look at that Pocoyo go!
00:11:08.280,00:11:11.360,"Oh, and there's Sleepy Bird."
00:11:16.920,00:11:20.200,Pocoyo and Elly are neck and neck again!
00:11:20.320,00:11:22.200,What a race!
00:11:23.760,00:11:25.240,"Oh, no, what was that?"
00:11:37.280,00:11:43.480,"It looks like the car and scooter have fallen apart, and so close to the finish."
00:11:44.040,00:11:44.840,"Oh, dear."
00:11:44.960,00:11:49.960,How are Pocoyo and Elly going to finish the race without a car or scooter?
00:11:50.080,00:11:56.920,"You know, I wonder if there's a way you might still be able to finish the race."
00:11:57.040,00:11:58.840,"Just think, Pocoyo."
00:11:58.960,00:12:00.920,You have a bit that still works.
00:12:01.040,00:12:03.640,"And, Elly, you have another bit."
00:12:03.920,00:12:07.600,"Is there a way you can make a new vehicle, Pocoyo?"
00:12:07.720,00:12:15.480,Can any of you help Pocoyo and Elly work out how they could make something new?
00:12:21.720,00:12:28.600,"If you put each of your pieces together, you can finish the race together in style."
00:12:30.560,00:12:32.040,Look at that.
00:12:32.160,00:12:34.640,Pocoyo and Elly have made a...
00:12:34.760,00:12:35.720,Car-Ooter.
00:12:43.520,00:12:46.320,It appears that you've both won the race...
00:12:46.440,00:12:48.320,Together!
00:12:52.960,00:13:00.200,"Oh, well, um, actually, it seems that Sleepy Bird is the winner."
00:13:01.680,00:13:08.720,"Ah, I suppose it just goes to show, it's really not who gets to the finish line first that matters."
00:13:08.840,00:13:12.400,The fun is all in how you get there.
00:13:12.520,00:13:13.920,And with whom.
00:13:14.040,00:13:16.160,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:16.280,00:13:18.400,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:13:26.720,00:13:28.240,Pato!
00:13:33.160,00:13:34.160,Elly!
00:13:44.400,00:13:45.640,Loula!
00:13:50.200,00:13:51.600,Sleepy bird!
00:14:03.600,00:14:04.440,Hi.
00:14:25.960,00:14:29.840,"My, what a wonderful castle Elly has built."
00:14:29.960,00:14:31.680,"Don't you think so, Pocoyo?"
00:15:01.920,00:15:04.960,"What is it, Elly? Is something the matter?"
00:15:06.040,00:15:08.000,"Oh, I see."
00:15:08.160,00:15:10.600,There's something missing.
00:15:10.800,00:15:16.200,"Pocoyo, can you see what's missing from Elly's castle?"
00:15:18.280,00:15:24.440,Can any of you help Pocoyo work out what's missing from the castle?
00:15:32.680,00:15:35.240,It needs a flag.
00:15:59.840,00:16:01.040,"Oh, my goodness."
00:16:01.160,00:16:03.400,What does Elly mean?
00:16:03.520,00:16:09.480,I think Elly's telling you not to touch the castle while she's away.
00:16:12.760,00:16:18.840,And she wants you to make sure no one else touches it either.
00:16:18.960,00:16:20.640,Don't touch.
00:16:31.360,00:16:33.840,Don't touch. Don't touch.
00:16:35.120,00:16:36.440,Don't touch.
00:16:40.400,00:16:41.880,Touch.
00:16:53.600,00:16:55.400,Don't touch.
00:17:27.240,00:17:29.440,"- Pato, don't touch. - Quack."
00:17:50.720,00:17:52.680,Don't touch!
00:17:56.440,00:17:58.440,Don't touch!
00:18:07.760,00:18:12.360,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what Elly said?
00:18:24.240,00:18:26.680,wants to show us something.
00:18:26.800,00:18:28.280,Let's have a look.
00:18:28.400,00:18:30.240,"Um, what is it, Pocoyo?"
00:18:30.360,00:18:32.160,I can't see anythi...
00:18:32.320,00:18:33.280,Uh...Uh...Uh...
00:18:33.440,00:18:34.240,Uh-Uh.
00:18:34.360,00:18:37.760,"Pocoyo, what are you up to?"
00:18:43.800,00:18:47.760,"Yes, um, well done, Pocoyo."
00:18:54.440,00:18:55.400,Well...
00:18:56.680,00:19:02.480,I think perhaps there's someone here who needs to say something.
00:19:04.000,00:19:07.160,"Ahh, there you are, Pocoyo."
00:19:12.520,00:19:14.080,Elly...
00:19:14.400,00:19:16.680,Pocoyo touch.
00:19:18.560,00:19:20.600,"Sorry, Elly."
00:19:33.000,00:19:39.560,"You've said sorry, and now you're doing something to try to make Elly feel better."
00:19:43.280,00:19:45.080,You did it.
00:19:45.200,00:19:49.480,"You rebuilt the castle, and it's better than ever!"
00:19:49.600,00:19:52.800,Hooray for Pocoyo and Elly!
00:19:52.960,00:19:56.880,Nothing is ever unfixable when you are friends.
00:19:57.000,00:19:59.920,Bye-bye. See you soon!
00:20:07.880,00:20:09.400,Pato!
00:20:14.080,00:20:15.080,Elly!
00:20:25.320,00:20:26.560,Loula!
00:20:31.120,00:20:32.520,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:48.560,00:20:49.920,Hi.
00:20:52.320,00:20:54.240,Following somebody's trails?
00:20:54.360,00:20:56.120,Shh.
00:21:06.840,00:21:08.600,They're rather small.
00:21:08.720,00:21:10.720,I think I know.
00:21:10.840,00:21:16.960,They are exactly the same size as Pocoyo's feet.
00:21:18.880,00:21:24.360,Can anyone help Pocoyo guess who made those footprints?
00:21:32.960,00:21:37.760,"Pocoyo, you're following your own footprints."
00:21:50.840,00:21:51.880,Look.
00:21:52.000,00:21:54.520,There are more footprints.
00:21:54.640,00:21:58.720,And whoever left them isn't wearing shoes at all.
00:21:58.840,00:22:03.600,"In fact, I think they've got little paws instead of feet."
00:22:03.840,00:22:05.480,Who left those prints?
00:22:05.600,00:22:08.000,"Do you know, Pocoyo?"
00:22:09.840,00:22:13.720,"Well, did you leave those prints, Pocoyo?"
00:22:14.360,00:22:19.880,Can any of you help Pocoyo guess whose prints those are?
00:22:32.280,00:22:40.160,"You see, sometimes we leave tracks or prints behind us, like when we walk on sand at the beach."
00:22:49.640,00:22:53.120,"Now, those are very mysterious."
00:22:53.240,00:22:57.480,Who or what do you suppose left those?
00:23:05.560,00:23:06.560,Big!
00:23:09.280,00:23:12.480,"much bigger than your footprint, Pocoyo."
00:23:12.600,00:23:14.920,Big round feet.
00:23:15.200,00:23:16.080,Hmm...
00:23:16.200,00:23:18.960,I wonder who on earth it could be.
00:23:19.080,00:23:22.520,"Pocoyo, do you know who could be leaving these tracks?"
00:23:30.280,00:23:36.880,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who has been making these big round tracks?
00:23:43.560,00:23:46.400,It's Pocoyo's good friend Elly.
00:23:46.520,00:23:48.320,"Hello, Elly!"
00:23:48.840,00:23:52.920,"You... You certainly do have big feet, Elly."
00:23:58.400,00:24:03.520,"Now, here's someone who's leaving some very interesting footprints."
00:24:03.640,00:24:04.680,"Hello, Pato."
00:24:04.800,00:24:07.160,Going for a swim?
00:24:21.960,00:24:24.520,Aroooooo-Ooo!
00:24:27.920,00:24:29.640,Woo-woof! Woof!
00:24:30.000,00:24:31.360,Woo-woof!
00:24:32.120,00:24:35.440,But what sort of prints are these?
00:24:40.400,00:24:46.480,"Whoever left these prints has great big feet, even bigger than Elly's."
00:24:46.600,00:24:50.080,And whoever it is has webbed feet.
00:24:51.200,00:24:53.520,Whoever left those footprints...
00:24:53.640,00:25:00.080,"It certainly wasn't a boy, a dog, or an elephant, was it, Pocoyo?"
00:25:02.640,00:25:04.760,So who could it be?
00:25:07.200,00:25:08.880,Monster.
00:25:15.400,00:25:17.640,I do...I don't think it could be a monster.
00:25:17.760,00:25:18.600,Quack!
00:25:18.720,00:25:20.080,Pocoyo?
00:25:20.320,00:25:21.560,Pocoyo?
00:25:21.680,00:25:24.560,If you just take a look...
00:25:28.160,00:25:36.240,"Pocoyo, I know it looks as though the monster is very close by, but, really, there's no need to panic."
00:25:44.720,00:25:45.920,"Look, Pato!"
00:25:46.040,00:25:47.920,"That's strange, isn't it?"
00:25:48.040,00:25:51.120,The prints are right behind you.
00:25:51.360,00:25:52.240,Quack!
00:25:53.840,00:25:54.680,Quack!
00:26:01.200,00:26:05.760,"Can you see who left those scary-looking footprints, Pocoyo?"
00:26:05.880,00:26:11.480,Can any of you tell Pocoyo whose feet match these footprints?
00:26:14.840,00:26:15.920,Pato!
00:26:16.040,00:26:16.960,Quack!
00:26:24.520,00:26:26.640,going for a swim.
00:26:26.960,00:26:28.960,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:26:29.080,00:26:33.200,You solved the mystery of the great big monster.
00:26:33.320,00:26:34.200,Good work!
00:26:34.320,00:26:37.120,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:00:08.520,00:00:10.160,Pato!
00:00:26.000,00:00:27.320,Loula!
00:00:32.000,00:00:33.280,Sleepy Bird!
00:00:47.560,00:00:49.120,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:00:49.480,00:00:51.760,"Hello, Loula, too."
00:00:52.480,00:00:53.400,Hi.
00:01:02.400,00:01:09.760,They have a picnic lunch and a beach umbrella and-- Pocoyo? Where are you going?
00:01:09.960,00:01:11.800,That's not the way to the beach.
00:01:14.280,00:01:21.920,"Ah, good idea, Pocoyo, a ball, a round, orange, little ball."
00:01:22.040,00:01:23.720,What a good thing to take with us.
00:01:23.840,00:01:25.280,Round.
00:01:31.040,00:01:33.320,"Very good, Pocoyo."
00:01:45.440,00:01:59.440,"Well, I'm sure Loula will love to play fetch with it in the sand. Now, we'd better get-- Um, Pocoyo, the beach is, um, not that way either."
00:01:59.920,00:02:00.800,"Oh, dear."
00:02:05.320,00:02:06.760,There you are.
00:02:07.120,00:02:10.960,"Now, where is that ball? Do you see it, Pocoyo?"
00:02:16.360,00:02:18.560,Which one is it?
00:02:20.240,00:02:24.960,Can any of you tell Pocoyo which one is his ball?
00:02:31.760,00:02:33.200,Round.
00:02:39.560,00:02:42.040,Now we can go to the beach.
00:03:05.800,00:03:08.480,"Very nice, Pato, but oh, look out!"
00:03:12.640,00:03:15.520,"Pshew, that was close, wasn't it, Pato?"
00:03:16.160,00:03:18.760,"Uh-oh, here comes Loula."
00:03:19.560,00:03:24.400,"Oh, poor Pato. and after he worked so hard."
00:03:26.760,00:03:31.240,"Pato, I think Pocoyo's ball is somewhere in here."
00:03:52.120,00:03:56.040,Everything here seems to be round.
00:04:00.440,00:04:04.560,"But wasn't there something else about your ball, Pocoyo?"
00:04:08.240,00:04:13.000,Can any of you tell Pocoyo which one is his ball?
00:04:40.280,00:04:42.640,"Sorry about that, Pato."
00:04:52.880,00:04:56.800,"Oh, juggling, how clever. Look out!"
00:04:57.200,00:04:59.680,"Oh, dear."
00:05:00.560,00:05:02.000,"Hello, Elly."
00:05:16.000,00:05:19.840,Perhaps you should tell Elly what your ball looks like.
00:05:20.000,00:05:21.320,Round.
00:05:21.760,00:05:23.560,Orange.
00:05:29.880,00:05:32.560,What else did we say about the ball?
00:05:32.760,00:05:35.680,It's round. It's orange.
00:05:35.880,00:05:37.160,And?
00:05:37.920,00:05:42.480,Can any of you help Pocoyo workout which one it is?
00:05:54.280,00:05:59.480,"So now that you've got your ball, do you think we can finally go to the beach?"
00:06:17.680,00:06:20.640,"Well, I suppose we got here after all."
00:06:20.840,00:06:23.280,Hooray for Pocoyo.
00:06:23.600,00:06:31.320,"All in all, it's a lovely day for Pocoyo, and for me, too, for that matter."
00:06:47.680,00:06:49.320,Pato!
00:06:53.760,00:06:54.760,Elly!
00:07:05.000,00:07:06.320,Loula!
00:07:11.000,00:07:12.280,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:31.560,00:07:34.360,He's off to play with his friend Pato.
00:07:35.840,00:07:37.840,What's this?
00:07:41.880,00:07:44.080,I think it's a shadow.
00:08:10.520,00:08:13.320,What could be making the shadow?
00:08:20.080,00:08:24.600,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what's making the shadow?
00:08:32.920,00:08:35.880,I wonder where he came from.
00:09:42.920,00:09:43.920,Quack!
00:09:52.600,00:09:54.280,Ahhh-ha-haa.
00:10:20.920,00:10:21.880,Quack!
00:10:28.400,00:10:29.680,Rain?
00:10:33.480,00:10:35.240,Clouds cry?
00:10:37.280,00:10:42.360,"If I didn't know better, I'd think-- Yes, it's true."
00:10:42.480,00:10:45.040,The cloud's feelings are hurt.
00:10:46.280,00:10:47.960,I wonder...
00:10:48.280,00:10:50.800,"What will you do now, Pocoyo?"
00:10:51.960,00:10:55.240,You've got an idea? What is it?
00:11:00.720,00:11:02.080,Cloud.
00:11:07.520,00:11:12.760,"That's a wonderful idea, Pocoyo, But I'm not sure the cloud can hear you."
00:11:20.040,00:11:25.080,"If you all shout together, the little cloud will be able to hear you."
00:11:34.600,00:11:38.000,"I think the little cloud likes you, Pocoyo."
00:11:38.720,00:11:41.760,I think perhaps--could it be?
00:11:42.040,00:11:47.240,"Yes, I think this little cloud just wants a friend."
00:11:50.720,00:11:51.960,Friend.
00:11:55.280,00:11:56.240,Friends?
00:12:03.560,00:12:08.160,"his two new friends a ride. that means you too, Pato."
00:12:15.640,00:12:17.440,Ah-ha-ha!
00:12:31.080,00:12:32.920,There's Loula.
00:12:45.320,00:12:49.320,"Look, Elly, Pocoyo and Pato have made a friend."
00:13:08.320,00:13:12.680,Nothing brightens up your day like making a new friend.
00:13:18.440,00:13:19.880,See you soon!
00:13:28.680,00:13:30.320,Pato!
00:13:34.760,00:13:35.760,Elly!
00:13:46.000,00:13:47.320,Loula!
00:13:52.000,00:13:53.280,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:18.520,00:14:21.600,"Do you know whose birthday it is, Pocoyo?"
00:14:21.960,00:14:23.160,So?
00:14:23.720,00:14:24.800,"Oh, I see."
00:14:24.920,00:14:29.480,You want us to work it out for ourselves like a guessing game.
00:14:31.040,00:14:35.000,So can any of you guess whose birthday it is?
00:14:45.600,00:14:48.680,And she's having a party later.
00:14:49.400,00:14:50.960,It's very exciting.
00:14:51.080,00:14:55.520,"But, Pocoyo, have you got Elly a birthday present yet?"
00:14:55.840,00:14:56.720,No.
00:15:00.080,00:15:01.240,Make one.
00:15:04.720,00:15:07.120,You're going to make a present for Elly.
00:15:07.240,00:15:11.240,"But, Pocoyo, what are you going to make?"
00:15:11.720,00:15:13.400,Do you know?
00:15:15.760,00:15:16.840,So?
00:15:17.600,00:15:19.080,"Oh, I see."
00:15:19.360,00:15:22.960,It's another guessing game. We have to work it out.
00:15:23.080,00:15:24.120,What fun.
00:15:24.240,00:15:30.080,"Well, the party begins very soon, So I suppose you'd better get started, Pocoyo."
00:15:30.560,00:15:31.680,Pocoyo.
00:15:44.400,00:15:47.080,"What are you doing here, Pocoyo?"
00:15:48.480,00:15:50.560,"Oh, I see."
00:15:50.680,00:15:55.520,You're going to make the present for Elly out of all these lovely shapes.
00:15:55.640,00:16:00.200,That's a good idea. I wonder what it's going to be.
00:16:01.520,00:16:05.840,"Oh, that's a good start, a lovely, big pink ball."
00:16:23.480,00:16:28.880,"Oh, that's wonderful, Pocoyo. But... what is it?"
00:16:34.000,00:16:36.760,"Oh, I can't wait to find out what it is."
00:16:37.040,00:16:39.040,This is so exciting.
00:16:47.960,00:16:51.280,Are those going to go on your present too?
00:17:09.920,00:17:14.480,"Oh, I wonder what Pocoyo's present is going to be."
00:17:30.080,00:17:32.120,Is it time to guess now?
00:17:32.600,00:17:35.120,"Ah, let me see."
00:17:35.440,00:17:36.600,It's big.
00:17:37.040,00:17:38.440,It's pink.
00:17:38.560,00:17:40.400,And it's a present for Elly.
00:17:40.520,00:17:43.840,So it needs to be something Elly really likes.
00:18:05.520,00:18:07.520,An Elly for Elly.
00:18:08.360,00:18:12.600,"Um, but... do you any of you see something missing?"
00:18:14.000,00:18:18.200,"Now, what bit of Elly is it that's missing, Pocoyo?"
00:18:18.840,00:18:21.800,Can any of you help Pocoyo work it out?
00:18:22.080,00:18:24.760,What's missing from Elly?
00:18:33.800,00:18:36.080,Elly needs a trunk.
00:18:39.320,00:18:41.600,Do you know where it goes?
00:18:43.200,00:18:50.040,"Um, Pocoyo, do you think that's really the right place for Elly's trunk?"
00:18:50.360,00:18:52.240,"Oh, I see. You're playing."
00:18:57.960,00:19:00.520,"Oh, that does look funny, Pocoyo."
00:19:01.080,00:19:04.920,But where does Elly's trunk really go?
00:19:07.440,00:19:10.160,"Perfect. Well, isn't that marvellous?"
00:19:10.320,00:19:19.160,"Pocoyo has made a wonderful Elly for Elly and just in time for her party. Come on, it's time to go."
00:19:33.560,00:19:37.160,"It--it was from us too, you know."
00:19:37.480,00:19:39.440,"You're very, very welcome, Elly."
00:19:39.560,00:19:42.040,It was our pleasure.
00:20:09.800,00:20:11.440,Pato!
00:20:15.880,00:20:16.880,Elly!
00:20:27.120,00:20:28.440,Loula!
00:20:33.120,00:20:34.400,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:56.120,00:20:57.920,- Hello. - Quack.
00:21:42.240,00:21:44.920,"Don't be scared, Pato. It's fun."
00:21:47.560,00:21:50.680,"Look, Pocoyo's going to press another button."
00:22:01.000,00:22:03.280,"You know what it is, Pocoyo?"
00:22:04.800,00:22:06.160,Pato?
00:22:07.240,00:22:11.000,Can any of you tell Pocoyo What it's called?
00:22:19.160,00:22:20.440,Radio!
00:22:42.280,00:23:05.680,Robot P-A-T-O Robot Robot.
00:24:05.640,00:24:07.680,Pocoyo dance.
00:24:49.360,00:24:51.200,Don't you want to dance?
00:24:52.920,00:24:55.440,"Well, then, why don't you?"
00:25:00.280,00:25:01.320,What?
00:25:01.520,00:25:04.720,You don't know how to dance like Pato?
00:25:10.600,00:25:13.640,And you don't know how to dance like Elly either?
00:25:13.760,00:25:15.080,Is that it?
00:25:17.280,00:25:26.760,"Well, you may not be able to dance like Pato or like Elly, but I know one person you can certainly dance like."
00:25:28.840,00:25:31.320,You can dance like Pocoyo.
00:25:32.840,00:25:36.800,So how about it? Show us the Pocoyo dance.
00:25:41.000,00:25:43.760,Do any of you want to see Pocoyo's dance?
00:25:44.320,00:25:48.720,Maybe you should let him know that you'd like to see him dance.
00:25:49.200,00:25:50.240,Go ahead.
00:25:50.360,00:25:54.040,Tell Pocoyo you want to see him dance.
00:26:18.040,00:26:20.280,"Everybody, get up and dance."
00:26:23.640,00:26:26.600,"Ah, so many different ways to dance."
00:26:27.080,00:26:28.840,Everyone can have a go.
00:26:29.680,00:26:34.440,Hooray for dancing and for Pocoyo.
00:26:35.120,00:26:38.000,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:00:25.960,00:00:27.760,Loula!
00:00:49.040,00:00:50.520,Look at that.
00:00:53.280,00:00:59.040,"Hmm, can any of you tell Pocoyo what Elly is doing?"
00:01:10.160,00:01:13.200,"Looks like great fun, doesn't it, Pocoyo?"
00:01:26.640,00:01:32.240,"Well, it does take a long time to learn to juggle, Pocoyo."
00:01:34.040,00:01:37.520,"Elly, how did you learn to do that?"
00:01:44.760,00:01:47.080,I think she's going to show you.
00:01:55.240,00:01:56.360,Hmm.
00:02:03.680,00:02:08.040,"Ah, so Octopus is the one who taught Elly to juggle."
00:02:26.480,00:02:27.840,Hmm.
00:02:36.080,00:02:40.360,but Pocoyo has really set his heart on having a go.
00:02:52.400,00:02:53.480,Hmph.
00:02:53.960,00:02:54.960,Myah!
00:02:58.480,00:02:59.840,Very clever.
00:03:02.160,00:03:03.720,Ahhhh!
00:03:05.520,00:03:06.560,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
00:03:08.840,00:03:11.600,Octopus is going to teach you.
00:03:11.720,00:03:14.560,- Yay! - Uhhh.
00:03:15.160,00:03:16.240,Pocoyo juggle.
00:03:16.520,00:03:18.400,Mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm.
00:03:27.720,00:03:31.560,"I think Octopus wants you to bounce, Pocoyo."
00:03:46.560,00:03:48.160,"into a ball, Pocoyo."
00:03:50.120,00:03:51.160,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
00:03:59.760,00:04:06.560,"You certainly are getting good at-- at-- Well, whatever it is that you're doing."
00:04:08.000,00:04:10.280,Pocoyo juggle.
00:04:14.440,00:04:15.920,Mm-mm-mm.
00:04:20.040,00:04:22.040,Hm-hm-hm-hmm.
00:04:22.160,00:04:23.640,"Mmm, hm-hm-hm-hmm."
00:04:28.240,00:04:32.760,Octopus now wants you to open and close the umbrella.
00:04:33.480,00:04:35.760,I wonder what he has in mind.
00:04:43.480,00:04:44.880,Whoooo!
00:04:54.600,00:04:56.400,are going to put on a show.
00:05:07.000,00:05:08.880,Hup! Hup! Hey!
00:05:09.560,00:05:11.120,Hup! Hey! Hup! Ho!
00:05:14.760,00:05:16.440,"Oh, ho-ho, hey!"
00:05:16.560,00:05:18.240,Hey! Hey-hey!
00:05:18.360,00:05:20.000,"Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha."
00:05:22.320,00:05:23.840,Uh-uhhh.
00:05:28.240,00:05:30.920,"with the show, Pocoyo. Yes, you."
00:05:41.240,00:05:42.240,Ah!
00:06:22.720,00:06:28.520,"You're a bit too young to juggle, Pocoyo, but not too young to be juggled."
00:06:32.520,00:06:35.080,and be the star of the show.
00:06:37.240,00:06:39.800,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:06:50.840,00:06:52.440,Pato!
00:06:57.000,00:06:58.040,Elly!
00:07:08.240,00:07:10.040,Loula!
00:07:14.080,00:07:15.600,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:31.760,00:07:33.360,What is it?
00:07:34.560,00:07:37.120,I wonder who it could be.
00:07:37.600,00:07:39.320,Can any of you help me?
00:07:39.400,00:07:41.400,Who is that singing?
00:07:49.600,00:07:52.640,I had no idea you could sing like that.
00:08:03.440,00:08:07.760,There's nothing Pato loves more than getting clean.
00:08:07.880,00:08:10.880,"How many showers is that today for you, Pato, three?"
00:08:11.000,00:08:11.880,Quack.
00:08:12.160,00:08:14.560,"Oh, I'm sorry. Four, of course."
00:08:18.560,00:08:20.440,"You'd better get going, though."
00:08:20.560,00:08:22.920,Pocoyo and Elly are waiting for you.
00:08:28.760,00:08:30.240,"Yes, indeed."
00:08:30.400,00:08:34.520,Being clean certainly makes Pato happy.
00:08:36.200,00:08:58.560,"Uh, Pato? Pato, look out for that-- Quack?"
00:09:04.440,00:09:06.560,I wonder what they're having.
00:09:13.600,00:09:14.640,Quack!
00:09:35.080,00:09:36.920,"Oh, I see."
00:09:37.240,00:09:39.000,"Too messy, is it?"
00:09:43.160,00:09:45.840,"Pato, why don't you come out now?"
00:09:45.960,00:09:49.600,I'm sure Pocoyo and Elly have finished eating now.
00:09:51.000,00:09:54.840,"Yes, they're bound to be playing something else by now."
00:09:55.360,00:09:57.760,"Now, where can they be?"
00:09:58.800,00:09:59.800,Quack!
00:10:03.960,00:10:07.200,"Finger-painting, getting messy and having fun."
00:10:12.280,00:10:14.560,"Oh, dear, yes."
00:10:15.200,00:10:16.320,Um...
00:10:16.440,00:10:18.200,"It's all right, you two."
00:10:22.760,00:10:24.680,"You see, he just took a shower."
00:10:26.120,00:10:27.320,"What is it, Elly?"
00:10:27.440,00:10:28.880,Elly?
00:10:31.160,00:10:33.520,Elly? Pocoyo?
00:10:37.280,00:10:41.520,"You know, Pato, you needn't be so worried about getting dirty."
00:10:46.160,00:10:48.080,"Yes, I know you're clean."
00:10:48.200,00:10:50.960,But Pocoyo and Elly have finished painting.
00:10:51.080,00:10:53.320,I wonder what they're playing now.
00:10:53.440,00:10:56.480,"It can't be anything as messy as painting, can it?"
00:11:25.800,00:11:27.920,Not a spot of mud on you.
00:11:28.040,00:11:29.200,Quack.
00:11:33.160,00:11:34.240,Quack?
00:11:34.360,00:11:40.400,"Um, well, Pato was trying so hard to keep clean, but..."
00:11:40.720,00:11:44.080,Can any of you tell him what's happened?
00:11:53.240,00:11:55.520,you've got a spot of mud on you.
00:11:55.640,00:11:56.640,Look.
00:12:02.560,00:12:04.240,Pato? Pato?
00:12:04.360,00:12:05.720,Pato?
00:12:08.960,00:12:16.000,"You know, I was trying to tell you before, getting dirty isn't such a bad thing."
00:12:19.920,00:12:25.560,"Think of it this way: You like getting clean, don't you?"
00:12:27.520,00:12:35.440,"Well, how much fun would it be to get clean if you didn't get just a little bit dirty first?"
00:12:36.400,00:12:38.360,"Aw, look, how nice."
00:12:38.480,00:12:41.960,Your friends even brought you a bathtub.
00:12:43.680,00:12:44.880,Quack.
00:12:55.720,00:13:05.040,"if getting a little dirty makes bath time a little more fun, then getting a Lot dirty will make it a Lot more fun."
00:13:05.160,00:13:09.240,Hooray for getting dirty and for getting clean.
00:13:09.360,00:13:10.760,Hooray for Pato!
00:13:10.880,00:13:12.560,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:12.680,00:13:14.760,See you in the tub later.
00:13:14.880,00:13:16.360,Bye-bye!
00:13:25.000,00:13:26.600,Pato!
00:13:31.160,00:13:32.200,Elly!
00:13:42.400,00:13:44.200,Loula!
00:13:48.240,00:13:49.760,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:04.040,00:14:05.520,"Oh, there you are."
00:14:10.800,00:14:11.880,No.
00:14:12.000,00:14:13.440,Not Pocoyo.
00:14:15.320,00:14:16.280,"Oh, my goodness."
00:14:16.400,00:14:20.280,"Well, if you're not Pocoyo, Who are you, then?"
00:14:22.920,00:14:23.960,Quack!
00:14:34.520,00:14:35.600,"Quack, quack."
00:14:38.640,00:14:39.880,"aren't you, Pocoyo?"
00:14:40.000,00:14:41.320,What fun.
00:14:48.560,00:14:49.560,Quack.
00:14:52.000,00:14:53.320,"Um, how about it?"
00:14:53.440,00:14:56.360,Let's all be ducks together.
00:15:13.760,00:15:15.280,"Quack, quack, quack."
00:15:16.760,00:15:18.920,"Quack, quack-quack."
00:15:19.560,00:15:21.080,"Quack, quack, quack."
00:15:41.360,00:15:42.280,No!
00:15:45.240,00:15:47.000,"Well, then, who are you now?"
00:15:57.760,00:16:01.280,Now you're pretending to be an elephant.
00:16:08.200,00:16:11.160,"Oh, you want all of us to be elephants too?"
00:16:11.440,00:16:13.840,"Um, well, why not?"
00:16:13.960,00:16:17.000,Let's all pretend to be elephants.
00:16:28.560,00:16:31.320,all there is to know about being an elephant.
00:17:13.040,00:17:15.160,You're still not Pocoyo?
00:17:15.280,00:17:17.400,"Well, then, who are you now?"
00:17:17.880,00:17:19.760,Woof! Woof-woof!
00:17:25.160,00:17:27.240,What you're pretending to be now.
00:17:27.400,00:17:31.200,Do any of you know what Pocoyo is being now?
00:17:40.960,00:17:43.800,Let's all pretend to be dogs.
00:18:35.760,00:18:38.400,There seems to be something stuck in there.
00:18:46.000,00:18:48.000,"Oh, yes, look at that."
00:18:48.120,00:18:49.800,It's a pebble.
00:18:51.080,00:18:52.480,"Woof, woof!"
00:18:57.600,00:18:59.000,getting that pebble out.
00:18:59.120,00:19:09.800,"But I think I know who can help Loula, someone who has hands, perhaps, and is very good at helping his friends."
00:19:32.840,00:19:36.000,"Uh, I mean, elephant."
00:19:36.400,00:19:37.600,Dog?
00:19:37.920,00:19:40.400,No. Pocoyo!
00:19:45.600,00:19:51.240,"But, sometimes, there's nothing better than being yourself."
00:19:51.640,00:19:55.120,Hooray for Pocoyo being Pocoyo!
00:19:55.240,00:19:57.600,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:20:06.520,00:20:08.120,Pato!
00:20:12.680,00:20:13.720,Elly!
00:20:23.920,00:20:25.720,Loula!
00:20:29.760,00:20:31.280,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:43.960,00:20:44.800,Squeak!
00:20:55.840,00:20:58.280,"Ooh, look at them warming up."
00:20:59.640,00:21:00.960,Pato...
00:21:01.520,00:21:03.000,Pocoyo...
00:21:03.240,00:21:04.920,and Elly.
00:21:10.200,00:21:11.000,All right then.
00:21:13.160,00:21:21.120,"Ladies and gentlemen, it brings me great pleasure to announce the first-ever race of the Pocoyolympics."
00:21:22.080,00:21:25.520,"So with no further ado, let's meet the runners."
00:21:25.640,00:21:29.320,"First, the boy in blue, Pocoyo."
00:21:32.200,00:21:35.640,"Next up, he's quick, and he says quack."
00:21:39.080,00:21:40.800,It's Pato.
00:21:48.720,00:21:49.920,"Sorry, Elly."
00:21:53.400,00:21:57.920,And now the runners are preparing for the start of the race.
00:22:06.000,00:22:07.280,All right then.
00:22:07.400,00:22:08.760,Is everybody ready?
00:22:10.200,00:22:14.280,"Then on your marks, get set, go!"
00:22:17.000,00:22:18.280,"Ooh, that's a surprise."
00:22:18.400,00:22:20.480,It's a running 'round in circles race.
00:22:20.600,00:22:22.000,Look at them go.
00:22:23.880,00:22:26.960,I don't think I've ever seen a race like this before.
00:22:28.960,00:22:31.560,Who's gonna keep going the longest?
00:22:42.120,00:22:43.520,"Now, who's gonna win?"
00:22:45.360,00:22:47.560,"Ooh, watch out!"
00:22:49.320,00:22:52.040,"Bad luck, Pocoyo."
00:22:54.960,00:22:57.280,"Bravo, everyone."
00:22:57.400,00:22:59.480,What splendid running.
00:22:59.600,00:23:06.080,So can any of you tell Pocoyo and Pato and Elly who won the race?
00:23:15.640,00:23:16.280,Quack!
00:23:19.520,00:23:21.680,"Oh, yes, your prize."
00:23:38.680,00:23:42.360,"Now, what competition could we have next?"
00:23:42.480,00:23:44.040,Any ideas?
00:23:48.880,00:23:51.560,Toys and books Toys and books.
00:23:59.720,00:24:03.280,And the next competition is-- Tidy up quick.
00:24:05.080,00:24:06.160,Ready?
00:24:06.360,00:24:09.640,"On your marks, get set, go!"
00:24:42.800,00:24:47.160,I'm sure there's got to be something you're the very best at.
00:24:47.280,00:24:52.680,"In fact, I know just what the last contest should be."
00:24:53.320,00:24:55.280,It's going to be...
00:24:56.360,00:24:58.320,a giggling contest.
00:25:55.080,00:25:59.680,the loudest and the longest and the giggliest?
00:26:21.040,00:26:26.880,"You don't have to be best at everything, because everybody is good at something."
00:26:31.200,00:26:33.760,Hooray for Pocoyo. Bye-bye.
00:26:33.880,00:26:35.520,See you soon.
00:00:47.320,00:00:50.040,"There he is, flying in the vamoosh."
00:00:50.160,00:00:51.680,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:00:52.000,00:00:53.160,Hi.
00:00:54.200,00:00:55.400,Hello.
00:01:03.600,00:01:07.600,"Oh, it looks like Pocoyo wants to show us something."
00:01:07.720,00:01:09.480,"What is it, Pocoyo?"
00:01:11.760,00:01:14.800,Do any of you know what that is?
00:01:18.040,00:01:19.800,A tent.
00:01:25.360,00:01:26.960,That's called camping.
00:01:27.080,00:01:29.800,"Are we going camping, Pocoyo?"
00:01:30.320,00:01:33.800,Wonderful. I just love camping.
00:01:35.800,00:01:41.080,"Well, isn't this exciting, but, uh, is anyone else going with us?"
00:01:41.280,00:01:42.280,Quack! Quack!
00:01:44.760,00:01:47.400,Pato's coming camping too.
00:01:47.720,00:01:50.840,"Great, and have you got any luggage, Pato?"
00:01:58.800,00:02:01.800,Do you really think we need that?
00:02:18.240,00:02:19.640,Quack. Quack.
00:02:30.640,00:02:34.760,"Really, I don't think they'll be a bathtub where we're going."
00:02:36.360,00:02:38.000,"Oh, dear."
00:02:38.920,00:02:41.280,When will I learn?
00:02:41.640,00:02:44.400,So dare I say it?
00:02:44.520,00:02:46.480,"Is that all, Pato?"
00:02:46.600,00:02:48.120,All right.
00:02:48.440,00:02:57.200,"Oh! I just realized: we've got all of this stuff in the vamoosh, and we haven't packed anything to eat yet."
00:03:04.640,00:03:05.880,"Oh, my."
00:03:12.760,00:03:15.680,"Well, now perhaps we can go."
00:03:30.520,00:03:32.760,That's it? Just your Teddy?
00:03:33.920,00:03:35.480,"Oh, that's good news."
00:03:35.600,00:03:37.480,I think we're ready.
00:03:37.600,00:03:41.040,"Put your Teddy on board, Elly, and let's go."
00:03:45.280,00:03:49.280,I'm afraid we might have put too much into the vamoosh.
00:03:49.480,00:03:53.040,I think it weighs too much for it to take off.
00:03:53.160,00:03:59.000,"Pocoyo, Pato, what do you think we should do to get the vamoosh flying again?"
00:03:59.120,00:04:02.880,Can any of you help these unhappy campers?
00:04:03.000,00:04:06.120,The vamoosh is too heavy to fly.
00:04:06.240,00:04:09.720,What can they do to get the vamoosh to take off?
00:04:24.760,00:04:29.200,Pocoyo thinks it would be good if you left your bathtub behind.
00:04:30.120,00:04:34.080,"And, Pocoyo, maybe you could leave the fridge."
00:04:37.440,00:04:44.200,"Now, now, everyone, I'm afraid you're all going to need to leave some things behind."
00:04:45.520,00:04:47.240,Just look at Elly.
00:04:47.360,00:04:51.280,Leaving her one and only thing behind.
00:04:51.440,00:04:58.120,She knows that this camping trip is really about all of us spending time together.
00:05:13.240,00:05:14.600,Give it a try.
00:05:16.880,00:05:17.960,"Oh, dear."
00:05:18.080,00:05:21.680,"Pocoyo, don't you think you could leave something?"
00:05:25.000,00:05:27.200,"Now, that's more like it."
00:05:36.920,00:05:39.600,And look at that: success!
00:05:39.720,00:05:41.480,It's flying!
00:05:43.120,00:05:44.440,We did it.
00:05:44.560,00:05:46.400,The vamoosh is...
00:05:46.880,00:05:48.240,...leaving.
00:05:48.560,00:05:56.200,"Well, we did get the vamoosh off the ground at least, but it appears to have gone camping without us."
00:05:58.840,00:06:10.200,"You know, Pocoyo, you may not be able to go far away on your camping trip now that the vamoosh has gone, but maybe you don't need to."
00:06:10.240,00:06:11.960,You have your friends with you...
00:06:23.320,00:06:37.200,"It seems that it's sometimes just as pleasant to stay camping as it is to go camping, as long as you have everything you need: your friends."
00:06:37.600,00:06:39.280,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:06:39.520,00:06:41.560,See you soon.
00:06:50.360,00:06:51.960,Pato!
00:06:56.520,00:06:57.560,Elly!
00:07:07.800,00:07:09.200,Loula!
00:07:13.640,00:07:15.160,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:30.240,00:07:31.600,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:07:31.720,00:07:33.200,Hi.
00:07:35.280,00:07:37.240,Pocoyo play.
00:07:40.240,00:07:43.160,There's nothing more lovely than playing.
00:07:43.440,00:07:46.240,"Well, who are you going to play with, Pocoyo?"
00:07:46.320,00:07:47.720,Friends.
00:07:56.040,00:07:57.600,Friends?
00:07:59.160,00:08:00.080,Friends!
00:08:03.920,00:08:06.640,"Do you know what that is, Pocoyo?"
00:08:08.680,00:08:09.920,Friends?
00:08:19.120,00:08:20.640,Hello?
00:08:27.760,00:08:30.560,"But who do you think it is, Pocoyo?"
00:08:33.240,00:08:34.360,Pato.
00:08:35.760,00:08:38.000,"But, um, uh, Pocoyo..."
00:08:43.520,00:08:45.000,Pato.
00:08:47.360,00:08:48.440,Pato.
00:08:51.640,00:08:52.840,Pato.
00:08:57.720,00:08:58.920,Pato.
00:09:00.560,00:09:01.600,Quack!
00:09:02.560,00:09:03.680,Pato.
00:09:10.360,00:09:12.120,Can you help Pocoyo?
00:09:12.240,00:09:15.960,Is it Pato who's repeating what Pocoyo says?
00:09:25.280,00:09:28.760,Who can it be that's making that noise?
00:09:28.880,00:09:30.640,Elly!
00:09:40.080,00:09:43.480,Isn't Elly wonderful on her scooter?
00:09:44.920,00:09:46.080,Elly!
00:09:58.440,00:10:00.080,Elly.
00:10:12.240,00:10:15.840,I wonder who your friend could be.
00:10:17.040,00:10:18.520,Friend?
00:10:24.280,00:10:25.080,Friend?
00:10:29.800,00:10:31.200,Do you know?
00:10:33.640,00:10:35.480,Hello?
00:10:40.880,00:10:41.800,Shh.
00:10:44.600,00:10:46.080,Who are you?
00:10:50.520,00:10:52.080,Pocoyo.
00:11:00.760,00:11:02.440,Who are you?
00:11:12.120,00:11:17.600,would you like some help finding out whose voice that is?
00:11:18.800,00:11:19.880,All right.
00:11:20.000,00:11:21.720,Can you call out again?
00:11:22.680,00:11:24.520,Hello!
00:11:31.000,00:11:32.280,Pocoyo.
00:11:34.520,00:11:38.800,Can any of you tell Pocoyo whose voice that is?
00:11:44.640,00:11:46.200,Pocoyo?
00:11:54.120,00:12:00.840,"Sometimes in certain places, your voice bounces back to you, and you get to hear it again."
00:12:00.960,00:12:03.160,It's called an echo.
00:12:06.240,00:12:07.720,Try it again.
00:12:11.280,00:12:12.520,Echo!
00:12:18.760,00:12:23.240,and it can be lots and lots of fun to play with.
00:12:24.600,00:12:26.160,Pocoyo!
00:12:28.920,00:12:30.960,Wheeeeee.
00:12:42.080,00:12:44.240,"La-la-la, la-la-la."
00:13:07.920,00:13:10.160,to play with today after all.
00:13:10.880,00:13:15.680,"Hooray for Pocoyo, and, well, for Pocoyo!"
00:13:15.800,00:13:18.000,See you soon!
00:13:32.040,00:13:33.560,Pato!
00:13:38.120,00:13:39.160,Elly!
00:13:49.440,00:13:50.840,Loula!
00:13:55.280,00:13:56.800,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:11.280,00:14:14.200,"- Hello, Pocoyo. - Hello."
00:14:19.880,00:14:21.520,Where are you two off to?
00:14:23.240,00:14:24.600,Elly.
00:14:26.120,00:14:28.800,You're off to show your balloons to Elly.
00:14:28.920,00:14:30.600,What fun.
00:14:34.280,00:14:35.720,Elly.
00:14:37.920,00:14:39.480,Elly?
00:14:40.840,00:14:45.120,Can anyone tell Pocoyo why Elly isn't answering?
00:14:55.000,00:14:58.200,It looks like Elly is taking a nap.
00:15:07.880,00:15:10.360,"That's a wonderful idea, Pocoyo."
00:15:10.480,00:15:13.920,What a nice surprise for her when she wakes up.
00:15:21.120,00:15:22.120,"Oh, no!"
00:15:22.240,00:15:24.400,It's the balloons!
00:15:30.000,00:15:32.400,"Oh, no. Elly, come back."
00:16:03.840,00:16:06.040,"Good idea, Pocoyo."
00:16:14.400,00:16:15.920,But where has Elly got to?
00:17:00.200,00:17:02.400,"Yes, that's it."
00:17:02.760,00:17:04.520,"Oh, do hurry."
00:17:05.680,00:17:07.560,"Oh, please hurry."
00:17:08.040,00:17:09.080,Hurry there.
00:17:09.200,00:17:10.520,"Quick, quick."
00:17:13.920,00:17:15.280,Don't let her fall.
00:17:27.800,00:17:29.680,"Got a plan, have you, Pato?"
00:17:58.960,00:18:01.160,"But, oh, what now?"
00:18:01.280,00:18:02.960,Look where Elly's heading.
00:18:03.800,00:18:07.640,I don't think Pocoyo and Pato understand.
00:18:07.760,00:18:08.600,Wait.
00:18:08.720,00:18:11.720,Can any of you tell them what Elly is heading for?
00:18:22.240,00:18:23.800,Sleepy Bird!
00:18:24.320,00:18:28.560,"Um, perhaps it would be best if you left your nest just for a moment."
00:18:28.680,00:18:33.920,"You see, there's a rather large pink elephant riding on a skateboard heading this way."
00:18:39.840,00:18:42.080,Oh. She's almost here.
00:19:18.800,00:19:21.920,why you let her sleep so long.
00:19:28.840,00:19:30.280,"All right, then."
00:19:30.400,00:19:33.120,"I suppose I should explain, Elly."
00:19:33.480,00:19:35.640,"First, you floated up in the sky."
00:19:35.720,00:19:46.720,"And then you parachuted down to Earth, and then you nearly fell, but you landed on a skateboard, and then-- At least you had a nice sleep, Elly."
00:19:46.840,00:19:49.960,And we had a great adventure.
00:20:12.080,00:20:13.520,Pato!
00:20:18.160,00:20:19.120,Elly!
00:20:29.320,00:20:30.720,Loula!
00:20:35.160,00:20:36.680,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:51.560,00:20:52.800,"Oh, I say..."
00:20:52.920,00:20:57.760,"Yes, what or who is that?"
00:20:58.160,00:21:01.600,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who it is?
00:21:25.520,00:21:27.160,"Wow, look at that."
00:21:27.280,00:21:31.800,I do believe Elly is playing a round of golf.
00:21:39.320,00:21:42.680,Elly is going to show you how to play.
00:21:44.200,00:21:45.400,Pocoyo play.
00:21:45.520,00:21:46.600,Pocoyo play.
00:21:46.680,00:21:47.880,"Play, play, play, play!"
00:21:47.960,00:21:49.000,Play!
00:21:50.920,00:21:52.320,"Yay, yay, yay, yay!"
00:21:52.440,00:21:53.800,"Yay, yay, yay!"
00:21:53.920,00:21:55.840,Yay!
00:22:00.120,00:22:02.720,and see how Elly does it?
00:22:14.600,00:22:17.040,"Oh, Pocoyo."
00:22:19.080,00:22:21.160,Pocoyo knows.
00:22:22.960,00:22:27.720,However are you going to learn how to play golf now that Elly's gone?
00:22:43.880,00:22:45.240,Whoops-a-daisy.
00:22:49.840,00:22:51.600,Pocoyo knows.
00:23:34.840,00:23:36.200,No!
00:23:38.760,00:23:40.680,Pocoyo knows.
00:23:55.960,00:23:57.720,A trumpet?
00:24:11.600,00:24:16.560,"If you asked Elly, I'm sure she'd-- Oh."
00:24:18.240,00:24:20.520,A watering can?
00:24:29.040,00:24:31.040,"Oh, dear, Elly."
00:24:31.160,00:24:33.640,Pocoyo really does need your help.
00:24:42.880,00:24:45.640,"Oh, you've had another idea."
00:24:50.280,00:24:51.880,Pocoyo knows.
00:25:08.120,00:25:11.440,"Well, I think there is someone who could help you."
00:25:11.560,00:25:15.360,"In fact, she offered to show you before."
00:25:15.480,00:25:17.600,"Do you know who I mean, Pocoyo?"
00:25:22.640,00:25:23.640,Elly?
00:25:25.000,00:25:26.800,Show Pocoyo?
00:25:30.520,00:25:31.920,Yay!
00:25:38.600,00:25:40.200,See how Elly does it.
00:25:50.040,00:25:51.160,Well...
00:25:54.320,00:25:57.400,"I think you're ready to have a go, then."
00:25:59.400,00:26:01.000,"Wait, Pocoyo."
00:26:01.120,00:26:02.560,"Oh, dear."
00:26:02.680,00:26:06.920,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what he's doing wrong?
00:26:34.280,00:26:36.000,"Yay, yay, yay, yay!"
00:26:36.120,00:26:37.360,"Yay, yay, yay!"
00:26:39.920,00:26:43.040,and hooray for watching and learning.
00:26:43.160,00:26:45.320,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:00:14.760,00:00:16.120,Elly!
00:00:26.000,00:00:27.280,Loula!
00:00:51.200,00:00:53.680,"Oh, and look, there's Elly."
00:00:53.800,00:00:56.080,Looks like she's trying to keep cool.
00:00:56.200,00:00:58.240,"Hello, Elly."
00:01:01.840,00:01:06.560,"Um, you haven't seen Pocoyo today, have you, Elly?"
00:01:09.880,00:01:13.360,He usually enjoys the heat on a hot day.
00:01:13.480,00:01:14.440,I know.
00:01:14.560,00:01:16.560,Maybe he's with Pato.
00:01:16.680,00:01:18.840,"I'll see you, Elly."
00:01:22.800,00:01:24.800,And there's Pato.
00:01:24.920,00:01:29.120,I believe Pato is trying to keep cool too.
00:01:30.480,00:01:34.680,"Pato, you haven't seen Pocoyo, have you?"
00:01:36.880,00:01:41.880,"Uh, um, sorry, Pato, but was that a no or a..."
00:01:44.600,00:01:48.920,"Mmm, sorry, Pato, I still didn't quite catch that."
00:01:49.040,00:01:50.680,Are you saying y...
00:01:53.280,00:01:54.440,All right.
00:01:54.560,00:01:56.920,"Ah, well, uh, I'll keep looking then."
00:01:57.040,00:01:59.720,"Sorry to have disturbed you, Pato."
00:01:59.840,00:02:03.720,"Now, I wonder where Pocoyo could be."
00:02:05.400,00:02:08.240,"Ah, there you are at last."
00:02:08.360,00:02:09.480,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:02:09.600,00:02:10.640,"Hello, Loula."
00:02:10.760,00:02:11.960,Hi.
00:02:17.560,00:02:18.600,Flower!
00:02:18.720,00:02:20.280,Music!
00:02:33.280,00:02:38.960,"Did you know, I believe Pocoyo has the only musical flower..."
00:02:49.200,00:02:51.680,"Looks like it's empty, Pocoyo."
00:02:51.800,00:02:53.120,More music.
00:02:57.680,00:03:04.600,"How can you get your flower to play more music if your watering can is empty, Pocoyo?"
00:03:04.720,00:03:07.840,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:03:33.640,00:03:36.440,has dried up in all this heat as well.
00:03:36.560,00:03:40.920,At least you filled up your watering can for your flower.
00:04:02.520,00:04:08.840,"Oh, Pocoyo, that's very nice of you, Giving some of the water to Pato."
00:04:10.840,00:04:11.880,Oh! Flower.
00:04:20.160,00:04:21.560,"Oh, now I see."
00:04:21.680,00:04:26.920,Elly's going to take a nice cool bath to beat the heat.
00:04:27.040,00:04:28.320,What a good idea.
00:04:28.440,00:04:33.560,There's nothing an elephant likes better than a nice cool bath.
00:04:37.720,00:04:39.200,"Oh, dear."
00:04:39.320,00:04:41.360,There's no water left.
00:04:41.520,00:04:47.160,"Oh, there goes Elly's bath, and she was so looking forward to it."
00:04:52.880,00:04:56.360,"Oh, Pocoyo, what a good deed."
00:04:56.440,00:05:01.320,"You certainly made Elly feel better, but shouldn't we see about your..."
00:05:01.400,00:05:02.840,Flower.
00:05:17.760,00:05:22.760,It seems that Pocoyo used up all his water helping his friends.
00:05:22.880,00:05:25.360,Now there's no water for his flower.
00:05:43.120,00:05:44.560,Arooo!
00:05:51.600,00:05:53.840,Maybe someone will help you.
00:05:53.960,00:05:58.360,I think someone might be on their way right now.
00:05:58.480,00:06:01.840,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who's coming?
00:06:11.480,00:06:13.680,but I think the flower needs more...
00:06:22.440,00:06:23.440,Flowers!
00:06:23.560,00:06:25.240,Music!
00:06:30.720,00:06:35.960,"It seems that when friends help each other, magical things can happen."
00:06:36.080,00:06:38.400,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:06:38.520,00:06:41.280,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:06:50.120,00:06:51.600,Pato!
00:07:07.440,00:07:08.720,Loula!
00:07:13.480,00:07:14.760,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:25.400,00:07:26.480,Hi.
00:07:33.480,00:07:35.360,You're playing restaurants.
00:07:35.480,00:07:36.680,What fun.
00:07:36.800,00:07:42.080,I can tell by her hat that Elly is pretending to be the chef.
00:07:42.200,00:07:47.840,"So, Pocoyo, that must mean that you are pretending to be the waiter."
00:07:47.960,00:07:52.760,"Well, it seems that what you need now is a customer."
00:07:54.320,00:07:59.360,If only there were someone who could pretend to be hungry.
00:07:59.520,00:08:03.440,I think Pocoyo needs a bit of help.
00:08:03.560,00:08:10.320,Do any of you see anyone who might be a good customer for Pocoyo and Elly's restaurant?
00:08:28.080,00:08:30.120,Won't you sit down?
00:08:38.320,00:08:42.680,"Oh, look what's on the menu, Pato: noodles."
00:08:43.960,00:08:47.440,- That looks delicious. - Quack!
00:08:52.280,00:08:53.560,Noodles!
00:09:02.280,00:09:03.320,Quack!
00:09:23.240,00:09:24.320,Quack!
00:09:27.520,00:09:31.160,It appears he doesn't like he pretend noodles.
00:09:31.280,00:09:32.440,Quack!
00:09:38.440,00:09:42.200,"Ah, a nice bit of fruit for dessert, an orange."
00:09:42.720,00:09:45.080,"That does sound good, doesn't it?"
00:09:46.320,00:09:47.160,Orange!
00:09:57.320,00:09:58.520,Quack!
00:10:07.120,00:10:08.480,Quack!
00:10:22.600,00:10:24.160,"What's the matter, Pato?"
00:10:25.840,00:10:27.520,You're really hungry.
00:10:27.640,00:10:31.680,"But... But, Pato, this is only a pretend restaurant."
00:10:31.800,00:10:32.720,Quack!
00:10:36.920,00:10:39.560,Pocoyo's pretend restaurant.
00:10:39.680,00:10:41.840,It was make-believe.
00:10:57.440,00:10:58.400,Quack!
00:11:17.280,00:11:19.000,for such a hungry duck.
00:11:19.120,00:11:23.800,"It is a shame we didn't have any real food to give him, isn't it?"
00:11:26.000,00:11:28.760,And he is really hungry.
00:11:38.200,00:11:40.800,"Elly, what a wonderful idea."
00:11:40.920,00:11:43.280,Cake is Pato's favourite.
00:11:43.400,00:11:45.400,"Pocoyo, run and get him."
00:11:47.360,00:11:48.880,Cake!
00:11:49.560,00:11:50.640,Quack!
00:11:56.040,00:11:57.520,"Hello, Pato, old friend."
00:11:57.640,00:12:00.600,Why don't you sit down and have a bit of cake?
00:12:00.720,00:12:01.960,Quack!
00:12:13.520,00:12:15.040,"Heh, heh, heh, heh."
00:12:20.200,00:12:22.360,"Oh, Pat...No, no, Pato. No, Pato, Pato."
00:12:22.480,00:12:24.800,"Pato, no, don't..."
00:12:25.160,00:12:29.240,"Pocoyo, Pato thinks the cake is a pretend cake."
00:12:29.360,00:12:32.680,"He'll drop it. I know he will. Oh, what could we do?"
00:12:36.200,00:12:41.240,Can you help me to tell Pato that it's a real cake?
00:12:55.520,00:12:57.560,"Um, Pato?"
00:13:01.280,00:13:02.440,Quack! Quack!
00:13:11.880,00:13:15.640,"Ahh, another satisfied customer."
00:13:15.760,00:13:18.120,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:18.240,00:13:20.600,And hooray for the cake.
00:13:20.720,00:13:22.480,See you soon!
00:13:31.200,00:13:32.680,Pato!
00:13:37.240,00:13:38.600,Elly!
00:13:54.520,00:13:55.800,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:09.320,00:14:13.520,The stars are all twinkling so brightly.
00:14:13.680,00:14:18.040,"If you listen very carefully, you can just hear them."
00:14:21.960,00:14:23.520,Do you see what I mean?
00:14:25.040,00:14:28.880,And everyone is just settling down to bed.
00:14:29.000,00:14:30.520,Loula...
00:14:31.440,00:14:33.360,and Pato...
00:14:35.480,00:14:38.560,"And look, there's Pocoyo and Elly."
00:14:38.680,00:14:40.080,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:14:40.200,00:14:41.400,"Hello, Elly."
00:14:41.520,00:14:42.440,Hello.
00:14:49.400,00:14:52.240,listening to the sweet twinkling of...
00:14:56.360,00:14:57.680,"Oh, dear."
00:14:57.800,00:15:00.200,That doesn't sound good.
00:15:14.400,00:15:19.480,"Ahh, Pocoyo, Elly, do you know what that is?"
00:15:19.840,00:15:21.840,What about all of you?
00:15:21.960,00:15:26.760,Can any of you tell Pocoyo and Elly what that is?
00:15:42.600,00:15:44.040,Star!
00:15:47.440,00:15:50.120,"but you see, that star fell..."
00:15:57.520,00:16:00.000,"Yes, it's beautiful, isn't it, Elly?"
00:16:00.120,00:16:03.520,But that star belongs up in the sky.
00:16:03.640,00:16:05.120,Look.
00:16:40.080,00:16:45.360,"we'd better try and catch up with Elly, so we can explain to her about the star."
00:16:51.880,00:16:52.960,There she is.
00:17:02.360,00:17:04.120,"Oh, dear."
00:17:04.440,00:17:05.720,"Oh, good idea."
00:17:05.840,00:17:07.800,I wonder if Pato's seen Elly.
00:17:07.920,00:17:09.360,Pato.
00:17:10.920,00:17:12.360,Elly?
00:17:26.040,00:17:29.200,I don't think Pocoyo can see her.
00:17:29.320,00:17:33.920,Can any of you tell Pocoyo where Elly is?
00:18:13.600,00:18:16.240,What seems to be the matter? Can't you sleep?
00:18:16.360,00:18:17.680,But what's wrong?
00:18:21.720,00:18:26.880,misses the twinkle-twinkle of the stars putting him to sleep at night.
00:18:27.000,00:18:33.680,"I think everyone's having trouble sleeping without the twinkle-twinkle of the stars, Elly."
00:18:33.800,00:18:38.880,I think Elly would like one more moment with the star.
00:18:45.520,00:18:48.880,"Oh, thank you, Elly, that was nice."
00:18:52.480,00:18:55.240,How do we get it back up there?
00:18:55.840,00:18:58.200,"Oh, yes, the vamoosh."
00:18:58.320,00:18:59.880,Perfect.
00:19:19.120,00:19:21.120,"Uh-oh, watch out."
00:19:28.720,00:19:29.760,There.
00:19:29.880,00:19:31.720,Right where it belongs.
00:19:31.840,00:19:33.760,"Good job, everyone."
00:19:39.680,00:19:45.040,And now everyone in the world can enjoy the star along with you.
00:19:45.160,00:19:47.640,"Doesn't that feel good, Elly?"
00:19:56.800,00:20:01.120,"Hooray for Elly, and hooray for Pocoyo."
00:20:01.320,00:20:02.400,Night-night.
00:20:02.520,00:20:04.320,See you soon.
00:20:13.080,00:20:14.560,Pato!
00:20:19.160,00:20:20.520,Elly!
00:20:30.400,00:20:31.680,Loula!
00:20:36.440,00:20:37.720,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:54.360,00:20:57.320,"- Hello, Pocoyo. - Hi."
00:21:12.280,00:21:14.440,to build this tower.
00:21:23.040,00:21:25.360,"Oh, what's wrong with Pato, Pocoyo?"
00:21:26.320,00:21:29.920,What are those funny noises he's making?
00:21:39.280,00:21:44.560,Can any of you tell Pocoyo and the others what's going on with Pato?
00:21:51.600,00:21:54.200,Pato does have the hiccups.
00:21:54.240,00:21:55.200,Hiccups.
00:21:57.040,00:21:59.520,Hiccups are nothing to worry about.
00:22:00.280,00:22:02.560,But they are rather annoying.
00:22:02.680,00:22:06.320,"Do you want to get rid of your hiccups, Pato?"
00:22:07.640,00:22:13.560,Maybe together we can think of a way to help Pato get rid of his hiccups.
00:22:18.840,00:22:20.840,"Oh, sounds like Elly might have an idea."
00:22:22.680,00:22:25.120,"Oh, what is Elly doing?"
00:22:27.720,00:22:32.000,"Oh, Elly wants Pato to hold his breath."
00:22:33.200,00:22:34.480,"Nice idea, Elly."
00:22:34.600,00:22:36.800,"Do you want to try it, Pato?"
00:22:36.920,00:22:38.480,"Okay, Pato."
00:22:38.600,00:22:42.680,Take a Big breath on the count of three.
00:22:42.920,00:22:44.200,One...
00:22:44.400,00:22:45.440,Two...
00:22:45.560,00:22:46.400,Three!
00:22:47.640,00:22:49.200,"Well done, Pato!"
00:22:49.320,00:22:51.280,That should do it.
00:22:58.480,00:23:00.320,"Oh, dear."
00:23:00.600,00:23:03.800,And it seemed like such a good idea.
00:23:03.920,00:23:06.880,"Oh, you have an idea too, Pocoyo?"
00:23:11.600,00:23:12.520,Oh.
00:23:13.040,00:23:15.160,What is Pocoyo doing?
00:23:23.400,00:23:24.720,"Oh, I see."
00:23:24.880,00:23:30.200,You think Pato can get rid of his hiccups by standing on his head.
00:23:31.480,00:23:33.320,"Well, what do you think, Pato?"
00:23:33.440,00:23:35.560,Want to give it a try?
00:23:38.400,00:23:39.240,Quack.
00:23:44.760,00:23:48.800,"I say, I think this time it might have worked."
00:23:55.520,00:23:56.320,"Oh, well."
00:23:57.120,00:24:00.080,"That seemed like a very good idea too, Pocoyo."
00:24:04.600,00:24:06.040,"What's that, Elly?"
00:24:06.160,00:24:09.920,Do you think hopping on one foot might get rid of the hiccups?
00:24:10.040,00:24:12.240,"What do you think, Pato?"
00:24:19.280,00:24:23.320,Perhaps everyone should jump on one foot to make Pato feel better.
00:24:45.520,00:24:47.760,What's Pocoyo doing now?
00:24:47.880,00:24:56.160,"Oh, he's holding his breath, standing on his head, and jumping on one foot all at the same time."
00:24:56.320,00:24:58.880,"What do you think, Pato?"
00:25:05.720,00:25:15.920,"Pocoyo, while Pato is doing that, I might know a way to get rid of the hiccups, but it's a surprise, and Pato can't know about it."
00:25:16.040,00:25:20.040,One way to stop hiccups is to give someone a surprise.
00:25:20.160,00:25:23.800,"You know, like, come up behind him and say, boo!"
00:25:28.560,00:25:29.680,Boo!
00:25:31.440,00:25:33.280,Come back. Come back.
00:25:33.600,00:25:37.000,Pato can't know that you're going to startle him.
00:25:37.120,00:25:39.200,It has to be a surprise.
00:25:43.720,00:25:44.920,"Oh, hiding."
00:25:45.040,00:25:46.800,"What a good idea, Pocoyo."
00:25:46.920,00:25:48.360,Why didn't I think of that?
00:25:48.480,00:25:50.040,I've got another idea.
00:25:50.160,00:25:54.880,Why don't all of you help Pocoyo and Elly say boo?
00:25:55.000,00:25:57.800,So let's all say boo after three.
00:25:57.920,00:25:58.880,Ready?
00:25:59.000,00:26:00.000,One...
00:26:00.120,00:26:02.200,Two... Three.
00:26:07.440,00:26:11.200,but it started the tower swaying right behind Pato.
00:26:11.320,00:26:13.360,"Pato, watch out!"
00:26:26.720,00:26:31.880,The surprise that surprised everyone cured Pato's hiccups.
00:26:32.000,00:26:34.360,Hooray for working together.
00:26:34.480,00:26:36.040,Hooray for Pocoyo.
00:26:36.160,00:26:38.240,Hooray for hiccups.
00:26:38.360,00:26:39.160,Bye-bye.
00:26:39.280,00:26:41.840,"Hic! Oh, no, now I've got them."
00:26:41.960,00:26:44.760,See you... Hic... Soon. Hic...
00:00:54.000,00:00:56.560,And there are some more blocks.
00:01:14.600,00:01:16.200,Did you see that?
00:01:18.840,00:01:21.320,"Uh, maybe it was nothing."
00:01:24.360,00:01:28.200,Okay. I definitely saw something that time.
00:01:29.160,00:01:34.720,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what happened when he hummed?
00:01:43.360,00:01:48.160,"Well, I have to say these are not normal blocks."
00:01:56.200,00:01:59.240,"They really love the music, don't they?"
00:02:06.840,00:02:09.120,"They really can move, can't they?"
00:02:13.400,00:02:16.840,"And when it goes quiet, they all stop moving again."
00:02:21.600,00:02:24.200,"Oh, what a great idea."
00:02:24.320,00:02:29.600,Let's see what happens when we play different types of music.
00:02:41.600,00:02:44.200,"Rock 'n' roll. Oh, yes!"
00:03:07.520,00:03:10.240,"Ooh, jazz music."
00:03:10.360,00:03:12.600,"That's my favourite, Pocoyo."
00:03:29.400,00:03:31.640,"Ah, classical music."
00:03:32.000,00:03:34.840,Such an impressive sound!
00:04:00.440,00:04:01.880,"Um, Pocoyo?"
00:04:02.000,00:04:15.600,"Um, uh, Pato is-- Uh, um-- Well-- Pocoyo!"
00:04:15.720,00:04:18.440,You need to help get Pato down!
00:04:18.720,00:04:20.960,He's stuck on top of the blocks!
00:04:29.480,00:04:30.680,Music off!
00:04:36.200,00:04:40.920,"Do you remember what will happen if the music stops, Pocoyo?"
00:04:43.520,00:04:45.600,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:04:45.720,00:04:49.440,Do you remember what happens when the music stops?
00:05:01.520,00:05:03.920,Pato Falls with them.
00:05:05.480,00:05:06.600,"Pocoyo, quick!"
00:05:06.720,00:05:09.320,How can you get up there to save Pato?
00:05:15.400,00:05:17.120,Of course!
00:05:18.600,00:05:22.160,The vamoosh is here to save the day!
00:06:15.280,00:06:16.920,Bravo!
00:06:23.080,00:06:26.800,"Well, that was some adventure."
00:06:27.200,00:06:31.080,"Music certainly is wonderful, isn't it?"
00:06:32.600,00:06:34.560,Hooray for music!
00:06:35.240,00:06:37.240,And hooray for Pocoyo!
00:06:37.680,00:06:39.960,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:06:51.240,00:06:52.840,Pato!
00:06:57.400,00:06:58.440,Elly!
00:07:14.480,00:07:16.000,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:29.440,00:07:30.720,Hello.
00:07:33.960,00:07:36.560,Are you going to paint a picture?
00:07:39.720,00:07:41.280,"Oh, wonderful!"
00:07:41.400,00:07:46.280,"Oh, but, Pocoyo, what are you going to paint a picture of today?"
00:07:46.600,00:07:48.160,Friends!
00:07:50.880,00:07:53.440,painting pictures of your friends.
00:07:53.640,00:07:55.160,Who will you paint?
00:08:03.920,00:08:07.160,"Hmm, do you see anyone nearby?"
00:08:11.040,00:08:13.720,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:08:13.840,00:08:16.240,Who do you think he should paint?
00:08:25.000,00:08:25.880,Aroo!
00:08:26.000,00:08:29.400,I'm sure Loula will make a perfect model.
00:09:19.600,00:09:21.400,Don't mooove!
00:09:35.080,00:09:36.560,Loula! Loula!
00:10:09.160,00:10:12.000,you do look pretty for your painting.
00:10:29.640,00:10:30.600,Elly!
00:10:42.880,00:10:45.680,"to have her portrait painted today, Pocoyo."
00:10:45.880,00:10:48.200,But there must be someone else you could paint.
00:10:54.360,00:10:56.080,Pocoyo paint Pato.
00:11:16.600,00:11:20.040,"Ha, oh, this is going to be an extraordinary painting."
00:11:42.480,00:11:43.520,"Oh, no."
00:11:46.240,00:11:47.840,"Oh, poor Pato."
00:11:48.000,00:11:51.880,"He did try to keep still for you, Pocoyo."
00:11:53.360,00:11:54.600,Pocoyo.
00:11:55.120,00:11:57.800,Where are you going? What's the matter?
00:12:00.400,00:12:02.160,"Oh, I see."
00:12:02.400,00:12:05.880,You're not happy with the way things have worked out.
00:12:06.560,00:12:09.960,"But, Pocoyo, let us have a look at your painting."
00:12:10.600,00:12:11.840,No!
00:12:14.400,00:12:15.920,Just a little peek.
00:12:18.880,00:12:20.080,No.
00:12:23.400,00:12:27.840,Will you ask Pocoyo if we can see his painting?
00:12:27.960,00:12:33.000,"Maybe if you really, really want to see it, he'll show it to us."
00:12:33.120,00:12:34.840,Go ahead and ask him.
00:12:48.440,00:12:49.280,Look at it.
00:12:49.400,00:12:58.240,"You can see orange for Loula, pink for Elly, and an amazing Pato shape for Pato."
00:12:58.360,00:12:59.600,See?
00:13:11.680,00:13:13.560,"You see, Pocoyo?"
00:13:13.680,00:13:16.120,You really are a wonderful artist.
00:13:16.240,00:13:20.560,And your friends are lucky to have such a beautiful painting.
00:13:33.440,00:13:35.040,Pato!
00:13:39.600,00:13:40.640,Elly!
00:13:50.840,00:13:52.240,Loula!
00:13:56.680,00:13:58.200,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:10.800,00:14:13.800,"- Hello, Pocoyo. - Hello."
00:14:40.640,00:14:41.680,Doll!
00:15:06.400,00:15:08.200,"for a moment, Pocoyo."
00:15:58.000,00:16:03.760,"Pocoyo, um, maybe you shouldn't toss Elly's doll up in the air like that."
00:16:21.440,00:16:23.720,Noooooooooooo!
00:16:30.400,00:16:33.800,You just need to tell Elly what happened.
00:16:33.920,00:16:39.000,"She might be a bit upset at first, but she'll forgive you."
00:17:06.840,00:17:08.440,There you are.
00:17:08.600,00:17:13.280,"Um, listen, Elly, about your doll..."
00:17:16.200,00:17:17.120,Uh...
00:17:17.240,00:17:18.880,"Oh, um..."
00:17:19.000,00:17:20.560,"Oh, dear. Uh..."
00:17:20.680,00:17:22.120,Hmm.
00:17:34.640,00:17:38.800,"Pocoyo, I think you should tell Elly what happened."
00:18:13.640,00:18:14.880,Quack!
00:18:15.320,00:18:17.280,"Oh, look. It's Pato."
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.760,Quack!
00:18:41.080,00:18:42.880,"Oh, what was that?"
00:18:48.520,00:18:50.240,Stoooooop!
00:18:59.280,00:19:02.400,there's something you need to know.
00:19:09.360,00:19:10.200,Hmm.
00:19:10.320,00:19:12.960,"What are you going to do now, Pocoyo?"
00:19:15.200,00:19:20.440,Can all of you help Pocoyo make Elly feel better?
00:19:20.560,00:19:22.560,What does he need to say?
00:19:30.880,00:19:32.520,"Sorry, Elly."
00:19:46.800,00:19:51.920,"looking back, that it would have been better if you had told the truth right away?"
00:19:54.000,00:19:56.120,"Good for you, Pocoyo."
00:19:56.480,00:20:00.320,It's always better to tell a friend the truth.
00:20:00.440,00:20:02.240,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:20:02.360,00:20:04.360,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:20:13.720,00:20:15.320,Pato!
00:20:19.880,00:20:20.920,Elly!
00:20:36.960,00:20:38.480,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:50.120,00:20:51.080,"Hello, everyone."
00:20:51.200,00:20:52.200,Hello.
00:20:55.840,00:20:59.320,So what do you think you'd like to do today?
00:20:59.760,00:21:01.320,Do any of you know?
00:21:08.920,00:21:10.680,"Story, story."
00:21:16.200,00:21:19.000,And you will all pretend to be the characters?
00:21:19.120,00:21:26.960,"Oh, that would be great fun, and I think it's safe to say that, um, I'm rather a good storyteller."
00:21:27.080,00:21:28.920,You all get ready now.
00:21:37.640,00:21:44.720,"Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a brave young Prince."
00:21:49.200,00:21:50.560,"Oh, dear."
00:21:52.360,00:21:55.040,"Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:21:55.160,00:21:58.320,The Prince is the one who has a crown.
00:22:01.040,00:22:05.840,Can any of you tell me which one of our friends is the Prince?
00:22:10.960,00:22:12.520,"Sorry, boys."
00:22:13.440,00:22:15.760,"Now, where was I? Ah, yes."
00:22:15.880,00:22:19.680,"Now, this young Prince was called Prince Pocoyo."
00:22:24.400,00:22:26.000,And very handsome.
00:22:26.640,00:22:28.040,And strong.
00:22:29.480,00:22:32.040,"Oh, and tall, of course, yes."
00:22:32.320,00:22:35.240,But this Prince wasn't alone in his kingdom.
00:22:35.360,00:22:36.320,"Oh, no."
00:22:39.400,00:22:46.800,"There was also a beautiful Elephant Princess who had... Um-- No, no."
00:22:46.920,00:22:49.160,"No birds. Thank you, Baby Bird."
00:22:49.280,00:22:50.600,Thank you. Umm.
00:22:51.880,00:23:04.560,"Anyway, she was without doubt the sweetest and most charming creature in the universe, so dainty and beautiful and..."
00:23:06.040,00:23:08.720,"And... Um, strong."
00:23:09.840,00:23:13.960,"Yes, well, well, that's-- That's very impressive, Elly."
00:23:14.520,00:23:18.360,"I'll say, this isn't quite the story I was expecting to tell."
00:23:21.080,00:23:26.120,But I think a weight-lifting Princess will work out very well indeed.
00:23:29.680,00:23:31.320,"Now, where were we?"
00:23:31.560,00:23:33.120,"Ah, yes, yes."
00:23:33.880,00:23:45.360,"This delicate and dainty Elephant Princess loved the Prince, and the Prince loved her."
00:23:47.640,00:23:50.920,"Ah, this isn't going so badly after all."
00:23:52.480,00:24:03.040,But she was desperately sad because she couldn't go out to play with Prince Pocoyo because a crazy Duck would not let her.
00:24:06.640,00:24:09.000,"Ah, um, come on."
00:24:09.120,00:24:10.440,"Oh, do come on, Pato."
00:24:10.560,00:24:13.040,You're supposed to be the baddie.
00:24:15.160,00:24:21.200,"Look, I promise you, you can be the Prince next time, all right?"
00:24:21.440,00:24:22.560,Please?
00:24:25.440,00:24:31.520,"Good, so this crazy Duck was really cruel and crazy."
00:24:34.520,00:24:36.920,"Hmm, more crazy?"
00:24:41.240,00:24:44.880,"Just a little bit more crazy, Pato."
00:24:49.920,00:24:51.720,"Ah, that's perfect."
00:24:51.840,00:24:53.040,"Thank you, Pato."
00:24:53.160,00:25:26.320,"So when he saw the young Prince approaching, he decided to frighten him away forever with his fierce, terrifying, fire-breathing Dragon-- and started to-- the crazy Duck was so furious, he sent his best warrior, the Sleeping Knight, and his terrible army."
00:25:29.400,00:25:31.040,"hello again, Baby Bird."
00:25:32.720,00:25:36.680,"This time, Prince Pocoyo was surrounded."
00:25:36.800,00:25:39.480,No escape. What could he do?
00:25:42.160,00:25:46.120,Invite them all to a picnic? Why did I ask?
00:25:46.560,00:25:49.080,And to have a little sleep in his bed?
00:25:51.280,00:25:59.840,"But crazy Duck was really angry with him, so angry that he-- Started to water his plants?"
00:26:00.600,00:26:02.760,And the Elephant Princess...
00:26:02.880,00:26:05.240,went for a ride on her scooter?
00:26:05.400,00:26:06.960,"Elly, Elly."
00:26:07.320,00:26:11.160,"But this is not a-- Oh, um, and Prince Pocoyo..."
00:26:11.760,00:26:13.680,Played in his car?
00:26:14.320,00:26:15.880,And the crazy Duck...
00:26:16.040,00:26:18.160,bought himself a canary?
00:26:22.440,00:26:24.120,"Oh, wait a moment."
00:26:24.240,00:26:26.280,Now I get it.
00:26:26.400,00:26:27.760,Yes.
00:26:28.560,00:26:36.840,"Once upon a time, there were some great friends who just loved playing together."
00:26:40.760,00:26:44.720,"Hooray for stories, and hooray for Pocoyo."
00:26:44.840,00:26:46.760,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:00:08.560,00:00:10.240,Pato!
00:00:45.640,00:00:46.840,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:00:54.720,00:01:00.240,"How lovely, a picture of Pocoyo and his good friend Elly."
00:01:00.360,00:01:02.640,I'm sure Elly would love to see that.
00:01:03.640,00:01:06.800,"It would be great, wouldn't it, if you could send it to her..."
00:01:08.040,00:01:11.600,If there was someone who could deliver it to Elly for you.
00:01:11.720,00:01:17.680,What you really need is someone who would like to be a postman for the day.
00:01:25.200,00:01:26.200,Hmm.
00:01:26.320,00:01:30.720,"But who around here would want to be a postman, Pocoyo?"
00:01:31.560,00:01:37.000,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who might be our postman?
00:01:52.160,00:01:56.240,"And something tells me he really, really wants the job."
00:02:09.640,00:02:11.560,"Well, you'd best be off."
00:02:12.080,00:02:15.400,"You've got a delivery to make, Pato the postman."
00:02:21.760,00:02:27.400,And so Pato is taking his first very important delivery to Elly.
00:02:27.920,00:02:30.040,"It's a long way, isn't it, Pato?"
00:02:45.000,00:02:47.000,"Well done, Pato!"
00:02:47.120,00:02:49.880,You've made your first delivery.
00:03:26.480,00:03:29.760,you're about to make your second delivery too.
00:03:30.000,00:03:32.480,It's a letter from Elly to Pocoyo.
00:03:33.200,00:03:37.840,"Ah, this whole postman idea certainly is fun, isn't it?"
00:03:40.080,00:03:44.800,"Oh, Pocoyo, it is exciting to get a letter in return, isn't it?"
00:04:05.800,00:04:08.480,I'm sure you'll get lots in return.
00:04:18.680,00:04:22.760,"Oh, I don't think Pocoyo has any more letters today, Pato."
00:04:36.400,00:04:37.920,"Oh, no Elly?"
00:04:42.520,00:04:44.400,I suppose it's for Pocoyo.
00:04:49.360,00:04:54.360,"Pato, that's too difficult, even for an expert postman like yourself."
00:04:55.160,00:04:59.880,I wonder what could be in such a large box.
00:05:00.000,00:05:01.880,It's almost as Big as Elly...
00:05:03.200,00:05:05.520,Even sounds like her.
00:05:11.800,00:05:14.120,"Another delivery for you, Pocoyo."
00:05:14.480,00:05:16.920,"What do you think is in the box, Pocoyo?"
00:05:25.040,00:05:26.880,"Good idea, Pocoyo."
00:05:27.000,00:05:29.200,We'll ask our friends.
00:05:29.320,00:05:34.520,So can any of you guess what's inside this gigantic box?
00:05:41.360,00:05:44.040,"I bet the ears gave it away, didn't they?"
00:06:10.440,00:06:11.760,"Oh, look, Pato."
00:06:11.880,00:06:15.280,I think there might be another delivery after all.
00:06:15.400,00:06:18.000,It looks like a special delivery.
00:06:18.200,00:06:20.680,"Now, how can it be for?"
00:06:22.760,00:06:28.640,"Here's to Pato, a great postman and an even greater friend."
00:06:29.920,00:06:31.480,Hooray for Pato!
00:06:31.600,00:06:33.120,Hooray for Elly!
00:06:33.240,00:06:34.920,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:06:50.200,00:06:51.760,Pato!
00:06:56.160,00:06:57.280,Elly!
00:07:07.480,00:07:08.840,Loula!
00:07:13.400,00:07:14.840,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:38.520,00:07:39.520,Arf!
00:07:50.200,00:07:53.240,"You two are having a good time, aren't you?"
00:07:53.680,00:07:54.640,Loula!
00:07:59.600,00:08:00.680,Stop!
00:08:04.280,00:08:05.160,Ball!
00:08:39.600,00:08:40.960,Doggy.
00:08:52.520,00:08:55.360,What's that on the dog's back?
00:08:59.360,00:09:03.960,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what that is on the dog's back?
00:09:12.040,00:09:14.280,That must be a wind-up toy.
00:09:15.600,00:09:16.600,"Yes, Pocoyo."
00:09:16.720,00:09:19.120,Turning the key is a great idea.
00:09:19.240,00:09:20.840,Keep turning.
00:09:24.440,00:09:27.240,"Now, set the dog down."
00:09:44.040,00:09:45.400,Woof! Woof!
00:10:04.960,00:10:06.000,Arf! Arf!
00:10:07.760,00:10:10.120,Isn't that clever?
00:10:13.360,00:10:14.680,Doggy.
00:10:19.560,00:10:20.720,Aroo!
00:10:28.960,00:10:29.920,Woof.
00:10:41.840,00:10:43.160,Uff.
00:11:04.040,00:11:07.040,"That is a very good trick, isn't it?"
00:11:15.280,00:11:18.720,"Loula's doing some tricks for you too, Pocoyo."
00:11:21.160,00:11:23.560,"Loula, that's a clever trick as well."
00:11:24.840,00:11:27.560,"Oh, well. Never mind, Loula."
00:11:32.720,00:11:34.400,"Um, Pocoyo?"
00:11:34.680,00:11:38.360,I think someone is feeling sad.
00:11:39.200,00:11:43.600,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who's feeling sad?
00:11:57.920,00:12:01.080,and I think she felt a little left out.
00:12:16.320,00:12:17.320,Loula.
00:12:19.720,00:12:21.240,Loula play?
00:12:22.120,00:12:23.560,Arooooo!
00:12:29.120,00:12:30.080,Wow.
00:12:43.040,00:12:47.600,Pocoyo loves you much more than he loves his toy puppy.
00:13:02.840,00:13:11.760,"Sometimes you just need to pay a bit of attention to the puppies and people around you, and everyone has fun."
00:13:11.880,00:13:13.440,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:14.040,00:13:15.120,Arooo!
00:13:15.240,00:13:16.640,Hooray for Loula!
00:13:17.360,00:13:19.320,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:13:31.200,00:13:32.880,Pato!
00:13:37.280,00:13:38.400,Elly!
00:13:48.600,00:13:49.960,Loula!
00:13:54.520,00:13:55.960,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:08.120,00:14:09.320,"- Hello, Pato. - Quack."
00:14:10.720,00:14:13.760,And what are our little friends up to today?
00:14:15.360,00:14:16.920,"Ey, did you hear that?"
00:14:17.920,00:14:18.960,"Oh, look!"
00:14:19.080,00:14:21.120,It's our friend Octopus.
00:14:25.920,00:14:27.640,"Oh, and look what he's got with him."
00:14:28.760,00:14:34.640,"Can any of you tell Pocoyo, Pato, and Elly, what Octopus is carrying?"
00:14:47.640,00:14:51.040,And it looks like octopus has a great idea.
00:14:55.200,00:14:56.200,Pphhbt!
00:15:01.240,00:15:04.360,"Oh, it looks like Pato has the first turn, Pocoyo."
00:15:05.880,00:15:07.560,"Oh, don't worry, Pocoyo."
00:15:21.640,00:15:23.360,- Poor Pato. - Quack.
00:15:35.840,00:15:37.960,"Oh, it's Octopus."
00:15:38.080,00:15:40.040,He's winding up and...
00:15:40.160,00:15:41.200,Wait!
00:15:41.320,00:15:42.680,I think it is! Yes!
00:15:42.800,00:15:45.760,It's the whipping windmill whopper!
00:15:48.640,00:15:51.120,"Well, that's one way to hit the ball, Pato."
00:16:02.280,00:16:05.480,Bringing the ball back is a very important job.
00:16:05.600,00:16:09.080,Especially when we only have one ball.
00:16:09.320,00:16:11.520,It looks like Elly is going to bat now.
00:16:11.640,00:16:14.080,"After all, she was waiting too, remember?"
00:16:14.200,00:16:16.680,"But don't worry, Pocoyo. You'll be next."
00:17:35.560,00:17:38.320,I knew she'd work out how to do it sooner or later.
00:17:38.440,00:17:40.280,It's... It's going!
00:17:40.400,00:17:42.720,It still seems to be going!
00:17:42.840,00:17:44.280,Now where's it gone?
00:17:45.520,00:17:47.600,"Why, it's Sleepy Bird."
00:17:47.720,00:17:49.560,Maybe she's seen the ball.
00:17:51.560,00:17:54.200,"Well, that's closer, Pocoyo."
00:17:54.320,00:17:58.640,"But, um, can all of you help Pocoyo again?"
00:17:58.760,00:17:59.920,Is that his ball?
00:18:19.560,00:18:22.240,A snowman and some snowballs.
00:18:22.360,00:18:24.400,I wonder who's team he's on?
00:18:25.400,00:18:28.680,"Well, do you see the ball anywhere, Pocoyo?"
00:18:32.280,00:18:33.520,"Oh, wait!"
00:18:33.760,00:18:35.000,Do you hear that?
00:18:35.120,00:18:36.320,What's that sound?
00:18:38.120,00:18:39.120,What was that?
00:18:39.240,00:18:40.120,What happened?
00:18:40.240,00:18:42.320,I think the ball just came down.
00:18:42.440,00:18:44.160,"Did you see it, Pocoyo?"
00:18:44.360,00:18:46.000,What about all of you?
00:18:46.120,00:18:49.360,Did any of you see where the ball landed?
00:19:02.640,00:19:03.840,It's that one.
00:19:09.920,00:19:11.360,"Great job, Pocoyo."
00:19:21.480,00:19:26.720,"And, now, at last it's Pocoyo's turn to bat."
00:19:28.120,00:19:31.840,"Remember, Pocoyo, keep your eye on the ball."
00:19:43.120,00:19:44.840,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:19:44.960,00:19:47.760,And hooray for having your turn!
00:19:48.200,00:19:51.440,"Right, let's go and get that ball now."
00:19:52.240,00:19:54.520,Bye! See you soon.
00:20:12.520,00:20:14.200,Pato!
00:20:18.680,00:20:19.720,Elly!
00:20:29.880,00:20:31.240,Loula!
00:20:35.800,00:20:37.240,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:48.560,00:20:49.960,"Hello, Pato."
00:20:50.040,00:20:50.800,Hi.
00:20:59.680,00:21:01.120,What a nice idea.
00:21:01.200,00:21:03.560,Elly loves to go picnicking.
00:21:10.360,00:21:11.280,"Oh, dear."
00:21:11.400,00:21:15.280,"Elly, looks, um, different, doesn't she?"
00:21:21.560,00:21:26.760,"Yes, Elly, there seems to be something different about your appearance today."
00:21:44.640,00:21:48.880,Can any of you tell Elly what's making her look different today?
00:22:05.880,00:22:07.320,"It's all right, Elly."
00:22:07.440,00:22:10.680,It looks like you've just come down with something. Don't worry.
00:22:28.680,00:22:31.800,The elephant spots are nothing to worry about.
00:22:31.920,00:22:35.640,Elly will soon get better if she rests in her bed.
00:22:35.760,00:22:37.080,That's all.
00:22:50.280,00:22:52.920,I think Pocoyo has an idea.
00:22:58.680,00:23:00.440,"Oh, wonderful."
00:23:00.560,00:23:08.400,"You see, Elly, if you need anything, you can ring that little bell and Pocoyo and Pato will come to help you."
00:23:16.880,00:23:18.280,"All right, then."
00:23:18.400,00:23:20.880,Why don't you two head off for your picnic?
00:23:32.600,00:23:34.840,Sounds like Elly needs a hand.
00:23:47.160,00:23:49.680,"Oh, I think Elly's thirsty."
00:23:56.280,00:23:58.200,"Ahh, yes. There we go."
00:23:58.320,00:24:00.600,"Now, why don't you two go and have your..."
00:24:13.080,00:24:14.840,I wonder what's up this time.
00:24:19.640,00:24:23.760,"Oh, she wants a vanilla milkshake..."
00:24:32.760,00:24:34.040,All right.
00:24:40.440,00:24:41.440,Slorp!
00:24:55.800,00:25:03.080,"Elly needs a watering can, a skateboard, a radio, a telephone, and lots of other things."
00:25:39.120,00:25:43.720,Can any of you tell Elly how we can see that she's better?
00:25:50.600,00:25:52.360,Her spots are gone.
00:25:54.280,00:25:55.280,No more spots!
00:25:58.480,00:26:01.200,"I think they're tired, Elly."
00:26:01.480,00:26:07.080,"Well, you know, they have spent the whole day running errands for you."
00:26:07.320,00:26:09.200,I wonder where Elly's going now.
00:26:20.800,00:26:26.960,"Yes, well, it looks like our friends will get to have their picnic after all."
00:26:27.400,00:26:30.160,And I'm certainly glad Elly could come.
00:26:30.280,00:26:31.480,Aren't you?
00:26:31.960,00:26:33.960,Hooray for picnics!
00:26:34.080,00:26:36.280,And hooray for Pocoyo!
00:26:37.080,00:26:39.080,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:00:14.800,00:00:15.840,Elly!
00:00:26.040,00:00:27.440,Loula!
00:00:31.880,00:00:33.400,Sleepy Bird!
00:00:46.840,00:00:48.000,Hello.
00:00:54.880,00:00:57.800,"Oh, that's wonderful, Pocoyo."
00:00:58.160,00:01:01.200,Can any of you tell what Pocoyo is drawing?
00:01:09.040,00:01:12.960,"It's a fish, a green fish."
00:01:13.120,00:01:16.800,And what a beautiful green fish it is.
00:01:19.960,00:01:22.560,"What are you thinking about now, Pocoyo?"
00:01:22.720,00:01:24.040,More picture!
00:01:53.120,00:01:56.120,How about a nice place for the fish to live?
00:02:02.480,00:02:03.680,"Hi, Pato."
00:02:03.800,00:02:06.200,Have you seen what Pocoyo's drawing?
00:02:11.760,00:02:13.360,"What's wrong, Pato?"
00:02:18.840,00:02:23.200,Can any of you see where that fish is?
00:02:28.280,00:02:30.760,"Yes, it's a fish in the sky."
00:02:31.280,00:02:34.160,"How imaginative, Pocoyo."
00:02:40.200,00:02:44.920,I don't think Pato has seen a fish that lives in the sky before.
00:02:50.640,00:02:53.640,"It must be a bird fish, a bish..."
00:02:53.760,00:02:55.040,...or a fish bird.
00:02:55.160,00:02:56.520,Or a fird.
00:02:59.240,00:03:00.760,"Oh, never mind."
00:03:01.960,00:03:03.240,Cht-cht! Cht-cht!
00:03:03.360,00:03:05.040,Cht-cht! Cht-cht!
00:03:05.160,00:03:08.000,"What are you going to draw next, Pocoyo?"
00:03:19.960,00:03:22.760,Huh! A lovely blue fish.
00:03:22.960,00:03:25.520,"That's really very nice, Pocoyo."
00:03:29.240,00:03:32.320,"Oh, now, I wonder who that could be."
00:03:32.600,00:03:33.720,Elly!
00:03:43.440,00:03:44.600,Ta-da!
00:03:55.680,00:03:57.120,Look at that.
00:03:57.240,00:04:01.040,Can any of you see where this fish lives?
00:04:08.880,00:04:11.400,Look at that fish go.
00:04:11.520,00:04:13.640,"It's quite the swinger, isn't it?"
00:04:16.360,00:04:17.640,"Oh, dear."
00:04:17.760,00:04:22.120,I don't think Elly has seen a fish that lives in the forest before.
00:04:26.120,00:04:27.960,Another picture.
00:04:39.320,00:04:41.400,This is really fun.
00:04:46.520,00:04:51.160,"Oh, what a fantastic red fish!"
00:04:53.560,00:04:56.920,"Well, I wonder where the red fish will live."
00:05:05.520,00:05:07.560,Huh! Look at that.
00:05:07.920,00:05:12.360,Can any of you see where this lovely red fish lives?
00:05:22.320,00:05:23.440,"Oh, yes."
00:05:23.560,00:05:28.240,I suppose that drawing does show where fish really live.
00:05:32.680,00:05:34.080,Wow!
00:06:00.200,00:06:06.040,"Oh-- Oh, I think Pocoyo is trying to tell you that he made those pictures for you, Pato and Elly."
00:06:09.080,00:06:16.680,I suppose it just goes to show it's lots of fun when you use your imagination.
00:06:17.720,00:06:19.120,What's this?
00:06:19.960,00:06:21.960,A gift for all of us?
00:06:23.200,00:06:25.560,"Why, thank you, Pocoyo."
00:06:25.720,00:06:27.760,It's lovely.
00:06:32.280,00:06:37.320,"Ha, hooray for Pocoyo and his lovely pictures."
00:06:38.000,00:06:40.520,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:06:50.720,00:06:52.320,Pato!
00:06:56.880,00:06:57.920,Elly!
00:07:08.120,00:07:09.520,Loula!
00:07:13.960,00:07:15.480,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:31.480,00:07:33.240,What are you doing?
00:07:33.560,00:07:36.000,"Oh, of course. We'll wait."
00:07:56.600,00:07:58.720,And a very nice one too.
00:07:59.600,00:08:03.120,Do any of you know what it's a picture of?
00:08:09.240,00:08:12.800,"Wait, is it Whale's birthday today?"
00:08:13.840,00:08:16.000,Is Whale having a birthday party?
00:08:24.040,00:08:28.280,"Elly, are you taking a gift to Whale's birthday party?"
00:08:29.560,00:08:30.960,A balloon?
00:08:31.240,00:08:32.480,Hmm...
00:08:32.640,00:08:34.600,But how do you wrap it up?
00:08:48.280,00:08:50.320,"Great work, Pocoyo."
00:08:50.880,00:08:54.840,I wonder if Whale will be able to guess what it is.
00:08:55.560,00:08:56.360,Pato.
00:09:04.120,00:09:07.400,"What a wonderful cupcake, Pato."
00:09:18.240,00:09:19.240,To Whale.
00:09:47.720,00:09:50.440,That sounded like a balloon...
00:09:50.520,00:09:51.920,popping.
00:09:52.280,00:09:53.600,"Oh, dear."
00:10:18.840,00:10:20.760,What a lovely fish.
00:10:36.520,00:10:39.160,"Pato, I think you've lost something."
00:10:39.280,00:10:41.120,"Um, your cake."
00:10:45.480,00:10:49.640,Something tells me that fish gobbled it.
00:10:53.280,00:10:58.000,At least you still have Pocoyo's wonderful card.
00:11:07.840,00:11:09.840,"Yes, there's Whale."
00:11:14.960,00:11:16.880,"Happy birthday, Whale."
00:11:20.200,00:11:23.680,And everyone made lovely gifts for you.
00:11:24.400,00:11:28.160,Elly was going to give you a wonderful balloon...
00:11:29.880,00:11:33.520,"But unfortunately, it popped along the way."
00:11:47.520,00:11:51.840,"But unfortunately, a little fish ate it up."
00:11:53.400,00:11:56.600,"Luckily, there's still another gift."
00:11:56.800,00:12:00.280,Pocoyo made you a wonderful birthday card.
00:12:02.920,00:12:03.760,"Oh, no!"
00:12:03.880,00:12:07.520,The water spoiled the lovely card Pocoyo made.
00:12:15.200,00:12:17.080,"Oh, dear."
00:12:17.200,00:12:21.880,"No balloon, no cake, and no card."
00:12:37.280,00:12:43.280,"Look. Whale is happy, even if you haven't brought a card or a cake or a balloon."
00:12:44.600,00:12:54.120,"Can any of you tell Pocoyo, Pato, and Elly what, or rather, who they have brought to Whale's party?"
00:13:06.880,00:13:09.960,"Pocoyo, Pato, and Elly are here."
00:13:10.160,00:13:13.880,Hooray for the best gift of all: friends.
00:13:14.120,00:13:15.960,And hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:32.360,00:13:33.960,Pato!
00:13:38.520,00:13:39.560,Elly!
00:13:49.760,00:13:51.160,Loula!
00:13:55.600,00:13:57.120,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:10.680,00:14:11.960,Hello.
00:14:23.440,00:14:24.680,You don't know?
00:14:25.160,00:14:27.960,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what it is?
00:14:50.960,00:14:52.320,"Oh, watch out!"
00:14:55.200,00:14:58.000,"Good thing you came along, Pocoyo."
00:14:58.120,00:15:02.040,Looks like your little friend needs someone to look after it.
00:15:20.720,00:15:22.040,Ahhh!
00:15:51.680,00:15:55.080,"Oh, what a lovely cake Pato's got."
00:15:59.120,00:16:01.640,"Oh, where's it gone?"
00:16:11.920,00:16:14.440,"What's next on the menu, Pocoyo?"
00:16:16.920,00:16:18.320,A table?
00:16:22.280,00:16:23.520,Quack!
00:16:28.280,00:16:32.880,"Oh, well, it really is very hungry, isn't it?"
00:17:02.560,00:17:03.720,Ahhh.
00:17:16.360,00:17:22.400,"Sorry, Pato, Elly, but Pocoyo's little friend just can't seem to get enough to eat."
00:17:33.000,00:17:34.320,Ahhh.
00:17:56.680,00:18:00.840,your Caterpillar friend is changing.
00:18:01.200,00:18:04.880,"Yes, it has made a cocoon for itself."
00:18:05.000,00:18:06.160,Cocoon?
00:18:11.160,00:18:13.120,big enough for it to rest in.
00:18:13.240,00:18:16.440,"Can you see anything that looks like that, Pocoyo?"
00:18:17.920,00:18:20.360,"Yes, Pocoyo, your friend is in there."
00:18:36.920,00:18:38.840,"Thank you, Dr. Pato."
00:18:39.280,00:18:50.520,"When your little friend comes out of the cocoon, Pocoyo, it-- Well, let's just say you'll be quite surprised by what it will change into."
00:19:12.920,00:19:18.000,"Ahh, I think I can see Pocoyo's friend."
00:19:18.320,00:19:23.640,Can any of you see what Pocoyo's little friend has changed into?
00:19:36.360,00:19:41.000,"Well, Pocoyo, your friend has certainly changed."
00:19:43.520,00:19:46.080,"Oh, the butterfly's hungry too."
00:19:48.320,00:19:57.680,"Well, Pocoyo, your friend has certainly changed, but it still has the same appetite, and it still seems to be your friend."
00:19:57.800,00:20:00.920,Hooray for Pocoyo! See you soon.
00:20:18.280,00:20:19.320,Elly!
00:20:29.520,00:20:30.920,Loula!
00:20:35.360,00:20:36.880,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:49.120,00:20:50.360,Hello.
00:20:50.520,00:20:51.800,Hi.
00:20:54.920,00:20:57.680,and what lovely colours they are.
00:21:02.200,00:21:03.600,"What is it, Pocoyo?"
00:21:03.720,00:21:05.640,Do you see something else?
00:21:15.440,00:21:16.560,"Oh, my goodness."
00:21:16.680,00:21:18.920,"What is that you've found, Pocoyo?"
00:21:21.320,00:21:24.280,"Hmm, that looks interesting."
00:21:26.440,00:21:27.840,Buttons.
00:21:30.080,00:21:32.560,Give it a go. Press a button.
00:21:32.680,00:21:34.600,Let's see what happens.
00:21:37.880,00:21:38.840,Look at that!
00:21:38.960,00:21:41.960,Your train has turned red.
00:21:48.960,00:21:50.240,Look at that!
00:21:52.160,00:21:56.720,"Oh, I wonder what is making the colors change."
00:21:56.840,00:21:58.760,"Do you know, Pocoyo?"
00:21:59.000,00:22:01.440,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:22:01.560,00:22:05.960,What do you think he's doing to make things change color?
00:22:13.360,00:22:19.200,"When Pocoyo presses the buttons on that toy, the colors change."
00:22:19.680,00:22:22.840,"Oh, try pressing a different button, Pocoyo."
00:22:28.760,00:22:30.800,"Yes, it is the toy."
00:22:30.920,00:22:33.840,It changes the colors of things.
00:22:33.960,00:22:35.560,Amazing.
00:23:06.480,00:23:07.680,Quack!
00:23:08.160,00:23:09.760,Hello.
00:23:12.600,00:23:13.680,Quack!
00:23:28.520,00:23:29.920,Quack!
00:23:43.200,00:23:44.560,Yay!
00:23:51.760,00:23:52.720,Quack!
00:23:58.120,00:23:58.920,Quack!
00:23:59.520,00:24:01.600,"Careful, Pato."
00:24:14.360,00:24:15.680,"Oh, dear."
00:24:27.640,00:24:29.160,"Colours, colours, colours."
00:24:33.160,00:24:41.520,"Um, Pocoyo, Pocoyo, Pocoyo-- Are you having fun changing colors?"
00:24:42.200,00:24:47.240,"Yes, and do you think everyone else is having fun too?"
00:24:48.000,00:24:49.600,Really?
00:25:01.160,00:25:04.520,"Would you like to turn things back to normal, Pocoyo?"
00:25:05.240,00:25:07.880,"Well, I'm sure we can do that."
00:25:08.000,00:25:12.280,We just need to remember what everyone's proper color is.
00:25:12.760,00:25:15.720,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:25:16.080,00:25:19.520,Why don't you shout out when Pocoyo gets it right?
00:25:20.160,00:25:21.520,"Go ahead, Pocoyo."
00:25:21.640,00:25:23.520,Try out some colors.
00:25:24.920,00:25:27.560,"First, what color is Pato?"
00:25:29.640,00:25:30.480,Pink?
00:25:30.600,00:25:31.640,Quack!
00:25:51.160,00:25:53.120,"Oh, yes, yes, Elly."
00:25:53.240,00:25:57.320,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what color Elly ought to be?
00:25:57.440,00:25:58.400,Is it yellow?
00:26:14.200,00:26:16.800,"Whoo, I think that just about does it."
00:26:17.080,00:26:18.280,"What is it, Pato?"
00:26:18.400,00:26:19.400,What's wrong?
00:26:21.880,00:26:24.360,Pato's hat still isn't the right colour.
00:26:34.160,00:26:38.800,"Great work, Pocoyo, and great work, everyone."
00:26:39.280,00:26:41.200,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:26:41.320,00:26:43.720,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:00:08.680,00:00:10.320,Pato!
00:00:42.800,00:00:46.600,"Pocoyo, Pato, and Elly are building a tower."
00:00:46.760,00:00:49.920,They're taking turns putting the blocks on.
00:00:50.080,00:00:51.840,"Hello, everyone."
00:01:01.360,00:01:03.440,Looks like it might topple over.
00:01:19.560,00:01:22.720,Now it's Pato's turn.
00:01:30.680,00:01:31.600,Quack!
00:01:36.280,00:01:37.120,Quack!
00:01:42.040,00:01:44.240,So whose turn is it now?
00:02:09.280,00:02:10.800,Ah-choo!
00:02:21.160,00:02:22.160,That's right.
00:02:22.280,00:02:24.800,Let's try to build the tower again.
00:02:41.120,00:02:42.080,Quack!
00:03:07.920,00:03:09.440,Choo!
00:03:33.240,00:03:34.360,There we go.
00:03:34.480,00:03:36.880,"Now, um, Pato?"
00:03:58.160,00:03:59.080,Ah-choo!
00:04:04.160,00:04:05.440,Pato?
00:04:08.640,00:04:10.560,"Can you see him, Pocoyo?"
00:04:13.480,00:04:14.600,Pato!
00:04:29.400,00:04:31.200,"Come on, Pato."
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.160,Quack!
00:04:44.520,00:04:45.960,Pato.
00:04:56.200,00:04:58.200,Is he all right?
00:05:06.080,00:05:09.200,there's no need to quack like that.
00:05:18.320,00:05:22.800,People and elephants can't help it when they sneeze.
00:05:22.960,00:05:25.320,It just happens sometimes.
00:05:28.880,00:05:33.120,"I think Pocoyo wants to help. That's very nice of you, Pocoyo."
00:05:33.240,00:05:36.640,I don't think Elly is feeling too well.
00:05:37.720,00:05:41.000,So maybe Elly doesn't feel like playing at all.
00:05:41.120,00:05:42.600,"Well, let's think."
00:05:46.520,00:05:51.600,Can any of you tell Pocoyo where Elly could go to feel better?
00:05:58.800,00:06:02.920,Resting is a very good thing to do if you have a cold.
00:06:04.600,00:06:09.720,"There, maybe Elly will feel a bit better if she has a little sleep."
00:06:13.160,00:06:19.320,"Yes, now you can build your tower without any sneezes knocking it over."
00:06:29.000,00:06:30.120,Ah-choo!
00:06:36.040,00:06:38.160,See you soon.
00:06:47.800,00:06:49.440,Pato!
00:06:53.880,00:06:54.880,Elly!
00:07:05.120,00:07:06.440,Loula!
00:07:11.120,00:07:12.400,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:32.240,00:07:33.720,Camera.
00:08:00.720,00:08:04.760,"Now, what else can you take a picture of with a camera?"
00:08:20.000,00:08:24.240,There must be something else you could take a photograph of.
00:08:40.280,00:08:42.520,"Ah, so you've found something."
00:08:42.640,00:08:46.680,Do any of you know what Pocoyo's going to take a photo of?
00:08:51.520,00:08:54.080,And that's a very nice thing to take a photo of.
00:09:00.800,00:09:02.120,Camera?
00:09:05.440,00:09:07.640,The camera's not here anymore.
00:09:08.160,00:09:11.440,I wonder what could have happened to it.
00:09:24.760,00:09:28.000,it's a photograph of a pink foot.
00:09:28.560,00:09:33.000,I think the person who took the camera has left us a clue.
00:09:33.120,00:09:35.640,They're playing a game with us.
00:09:36.040,00:09:41.720,"If we can guess who took the picture, then that person will have the camera."
00:09:42.000,00:09:45.920,"I wonder whose pink foot it could be, Pocoyo."
00:09:56.200,00:09:58.120,"Good dog, Loula."
00:10:04.280,00:10:07.720,What do all of you think? Is it the same foot?
00:10:16.600,00:10:19.320,"Hmm, it's a mystery."
00:10:21.600,00:10:25.400,"Pocoyo, look at that. It's another photograph."
00:10:26.000,00:10:31.000,"Yeah, well, now, this is getting more interesting."
00:10:36.720,00:10:38.960,But I wonder who...
00:10:57.720,00:10:58.800,Is it the same?
00:11:07.640,00:11:11.720,"So Loula hasn't got the camera, and Pato hasn't got it."
00:11:31.640,00:11:40.280,"seeing a blue backpack quite like that somewhere before. Do you remember who has a blue backpack like that, Pocoyo?"
00:11:47.840,00:11:50.080,"Oh, don't give up, Pocoyo."
00:11:50.320,00:11:56.480,"Maybe if we look at the photographs again, we can work it out. Let's see."
00:11:57.080,00:12:02.320,"A pink foot, a scooter, and a blue backpack."
00:12:02.440,00:12:08.400,"Now, who do we know who has a pink foot, rides a scooter, and has a blue backpack?"
00:12:08.520,00:12:10.240,Can you help Pocoyo?
00:12:10.360,00:12:13.880,Which one of his friends do you think has the camera?
00:12:21.760,00:12:29.080,I think Elly has been leaving us these clues and that she has the camera. Shall we go and find her?
00:12:36.320,00:12:39.040,You've found out who had the camera.
00:12:39.160,00:12:41.040,Good for you.
00:12:42.240,00:12:45.680,"Pocoyo, Elly was only playing."
00:12:50.240,00:12:55.040,"Oh, a photo of everyone together, what a good idea."
00:13:05.960,00:13:07.520,"Everyone, smile."
00:13:08.720,00:13:11.520,"Now, that's what I call a picture."
00:13:12.560,00:13:14.840,Bye! See you soon!
00:13:28.840,00:13:30.480,Pato!
00:13:34.920,00:13:35.920,Elly!
00:13:46.160,00:13:47.480,Loula!
00:13:52.160,00:13:53.440,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:09.520,00:14:11.200,Hi.
00:14:21.760,00:14:23.800,"Oh, I see."
00:14:23.920,00:14:26.400,"Made a new friend, have you?"
00:14:30.920,00:14:35.080,"Do you know what this lovely creature is called, Pocoyo?"
00:14:40.600,00:14:43.440,Can any of you help Pocoyo?
00:14:43.840,00:14:47.600,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what it is?
00:14:55.440,00:14:59.120,- It's a butterfly. - Butterfly.
00:15:23.640,00:15:25.120,Butterfly!
00:15:28.840,00:15:31.360,you might find it easier if you...
00:15:31.520,00:15:32.800,Pocoyo!
00:15:43.960,00:15:46.760,"- Um, you might... - Butterfly."
00:15:56.520,00:16:00.720,"One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four..."
00:16:11.840,00:16:14.320,Butterfly! Butterfly!
00:16:16.360,00:16:19.600,But where's Pato now? Pato?
00:16:28.480,00:16:31.120,"The butterfly went that way, Pato."
00:16:31.240,00:16:36.480,"Come on, let's see where that butterfly has got to this time."
00:16:40.320,00:17:15.080,"Ah, there's Elly taking a lovely nap Butterfly!"
00:17:22.720,00:17:24.360,Butterfly?
00:17:48.480,00:17:51.000,"Ah, there it is."
00:18:03.280,00:18:05.000,Butterfly?
00:18:11.880,00:18:13.280,Butterfly!
00:18:15.360,00:18:19.080,- Butterfly? - Shh.
00:18:23.760,00:18:25.720,by shh?
00:18:29.040,00:18:36.640,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what Sleepy Bird means when she says shh?
00:18:47.320,00:18:51.320,"Good work, Pocoyo. It means quiet."
00:18:51.800,00:19:00.200,"That's a great idea. In fact, I myself tried to suggest that very thing earlier when we..."
00:19:02.120,00:19:03.080,Sorry.
00:19:03.200,00:19:07.880,"The thing is, the butterfly is frightened of all the noise."
00:19:12.680,00:19:15.520,"Shh, shh."
00:19:31.360,00:19:34.800,so you don't scare the butterfly.
00:19:35.000,00:19:35.880,Well done.
00:20:10.680,00:20:12.320,Pato!
00:20:16.760,00:20:17.760,Elly!
00:20:28.000,00:20:29.320,Loula!
00:20:34.000,00:20:35.280,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:48.000,00:20:51.280,"Oh, I wonder what she's looking at."
00:20:51.400,00:20:54.000,"She's very excited, isn't she?"
00:20:54.120,00:20:56.840,"Oh, look, a bubble."
00:20:57.200,00:21:00.160,That's what Loula was waiting for.
00:21:02.320,00:21:04.720,"...burst it. Oh, dear."
00:21:05.240,00:21:08.240,"Bubbles are really easy to burst, Loula."
00:21:32.880,00:21:39.760,"You know, where there are bubbles, there has to be someone making bubbles."
00:21:40.360,00:21:44.000,Do any of you know who's making those bubbles?
00:21:48.680,00:21:51.480,"Look, it's Pocoyo and Elly too."
00:21:51.720,00:21:54.280,"Hello, Pocoyo. Hello, Elly."
00:21:54.400,00:21:55.640,Hi.
00:22:18.000,00:22:18.800,Right.
00:22:18.960,00:22:25.680,"So you put the wand into the bubble juice, then blow it to make the bubbles."
00:22:25.800,00:22:27.520,That's great.
00:22:27.640,00:22:29.040,Bubbles.
00:22:43.080,00:22:46.480,"Oh, aren't bubbles fabulous?"
00:23:24.600,00:23:26.680,Bubble!
00:23:30.240,00:23:32.080,Look at that.
00:23:43.400,00:23:46.560,"Oh, now, just a minute, you two."
00:23:48.600,00:23:50.560,"Oh, dear."
00:23:50.800,00:23:53.360,But we were all having such fun.
00:24:12.160,00:24:14.880,She still wants to play with bubbles.
00:24:26.200,00:24:28.240,No bubbles.
00:24:42.160,00:24:45.440,I think Loula misses the bubbles.
00:24:45.840,00:24:49.480,"It's too bad there aren't any more bubbles, isn't it?"
00:24:49.600,00:24:50.920,It's no use.
00:24:51.080,00:24:56.680,"Pocoyo can't make Loula any bubbles, and neither can Elly."
00:25:08.160,00:25:09.520,"Now, let's see."
00:25:09.640,00:25:13.960,Pocoyo can't make bubbles without the bubble juice.
00:25:14.080,00:25:17.840,And Elly can't make bubbles without the wand.
00:25:17.960,00:25:24.840,Can any of you help Pocoyo and Elly work out how to make more bubbles?
00:25:30.840,00:25:34.160,"Now, that's a great idea."
00:26:01.320,00:26:06.760,You're sharing and making bubbles for Loula together.
00:26:07.040,00:26:13.600,"Well, it seems it's even more fun to play with friends when you share."
00:26:16.680,00:26:21.960,Hooray for Pocoyo! And for Elly. And for Loula!
00:00:08.600,00:00:10.080,Pato!
00:00:14.520,00:00:15.520,Elly!
00:00:31.760,00:00:33.040,Sleepy Bird!
00:00:45.840,00:00:47.200,Hello.
00:00:56.920,00:00:59.640,"Yes, I see it too, Pocoyo."
00:01:00.000,00:01:02.440,Something shiny.
00:01:03.680,00:01:04.560,Hmm.
00:01:04.680,00:01:07.960,I'm not sure Pocoyo knows what that is.
00:01:08.400,00:01:12.560,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what this is?
00:01:15.360,00:01:16.320,Key.
00:01:19.360,00:01:23.360,And who knows what surprises it might unlock?
00:01:23.480,00:01:25.320,How exciting.
00:01:38.120,00:01:39.600,Treasure?
00:01:45.800,00:01:47.320,Treasure.
00:01:47.880,00:01:49.120,Treasure!
00:01:56.240,00:01:58.160,"Treasure, treasure, treasure."
00:02:02.800,00:02:03.920,It looks like...
00:02:05.200,00:02:08.480,"It is a keyhole, Pocoyo."
00:02:10.720,00:02:12.040,Treasure?
00:02:21.160,00:02:26.880,"Well, I don't know about treasure, But I've never seen anything like that before."
00:02:27.720,00:02:29.080,Hello.
00:02:29.200,00:02:30.520,Treasure?
00:02:33.600,00:02:34.640,Treasure!
00:02:37.200,00:02:38.480,Treasure?
00:02:42.680,00:02:45.200,"Sorry for waking you, Sleepy Bird."
00:02:47.920,00:02:49.440,Treasure.
00:02:55.200,00:02:56.400,Key!
00:02:56.520,00:02:58.160,Treasure!
00:02:58.280,00:03:00.120,Treasure?
00:03:00.640,00:03:02.240,Treasure?
00:03:22.960,00:03:23.880,Treasure!
00:03:32.880,00:03:34.880,"Treasure, treasure, treasure."
00:03:35.000,00:03:37.200,"Treasure, treasure, treasure."
00:03:41.160,00:03:43.000,Treasure!
00:03:43.480,00:03:45.280,Treasure?
00:03:49.400,00:03:51.040,Pato.
00:03:58.520,00:04:00.360,"Treasure, Pato."
00:04:12.960,00:04:14.680,"Treasure, treasure."
00:04:25.800,00:04:27.400,Yay!
00:04:33.480,00:04:35.480,How exciting.
00:04:38.640,00:04:40.480,"Go on, give it a try."
00:04:42.480,00:04:44.120,Whee!
00:05:03.000,00:05:04.480,doesn't it?
00:05:20.960,00:05:22.600,Treasure.
00:05:24.280,00:05:25.440,Treasure.
00:05:28.360,00:05:31.160,Nothing would surprise me after what I've seen today.
00:05:31.280,00:05:33.840,"Go ahead, Pocoyo, open it."
00:05:43.720,00:05:45.560,Sweets? Toys?
00:05:46.080,00:05:48.440,What could the treasure be?
00:05:56.360,00:05:57.840,What's there?
00:06:00.440,00:06:05.760,Will all of you go and look and tell me what's in the treasure chest?
00:06:13.640,00:06:14.800,Treasure.
00:06:24.600,00:06:26.640,After the fun we've had today?
00:06:27.720,00:06:34.240,"Keep opening doors, asking questions, and exploring your world."
00:06:34.360,00:06:36.920,That is the key to it all.
00:06:37.040,00:06:39.080,Hooray for Pocoyo.
00:06:39.400,00:06:41.240,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:06:50.880,00:06:52.520,Pato!
00:06:56.960,00:06:57.960,Elly!
00:07:28.480,00:07:29.720,Hi.
00:07:41.080,00:07:43.480,"Quick, Pocoyo, behind you."
00:07:46.560,00:07:49.680,What is Pato doing?
00:07:54.840,00:07:58.200,"Hmm, I don't think Pocoyo knows."
00:07:58.320,00:08:03.040,"I wonder, do any of you know what Pato is doing?"
00:08:19.400,00:08:21.120,"Mm, I wonder who this is."
00:08:36.440,00:08:39.720,Elly's got a skipping rope too.
00:08:58.760,00:09:00.280,Skipping rope.
00:09:22.760,00:09:24.440,"Thank you, Elly."
00:09:30.840,00:09:31.920,"Heh, heh, heh."
00:09:32.040,00:09:35.800,"Now, that's a good game. All follow Elly."
00:09:43.320,00:09:46.240,"you know how to skip with a rope, Pocoyo?"
00:09:49.880,00:09:52.160,"One, two, three."
00:09:56.520,00:09:58.600,"It's not as easy as it looks, is it?"
00:10:01.160,00:10:04.440,I know. Why don't you ask Elly and Pato?
00:10:04.560,00:10:07.840,I'm sure they'd show you how to skip with a rope.
00:10:11.960,00:10:14.760,"Well, if you're sure."
00:10:17.320,00:10:19.080,"One, two, three."
00:10:23.560,00:10:25.840,Perhaps I'll count you in this time.
00:10:25.960,00:10:27.080,Ready?
00:10:27.120,00:10:29.600,"One, two, three."
00:10:31.200,00:10:32.240,Yay!
00:10:48.480,00:10:51.280,"Can you see where it's gone, Pocoyo?"
00:10:54.200,00:10:56.920,"Oops, sorry, Sleepy Bird."
00:11:08.360,00:11:11.600,"You really want to skip with a rope, don't you?"
00:11:11.720,00:11:14.360,You need some help.
00:11:14.480,00:11:17.840,"Who could help you learn to skip, Pocoyo?"
00:11:24.520,00:11:25.400,Hmmph!
00:11:27.920,00:11:31.120,Can any of you tell Pocoyo?
00:11:37.320,00:11:40.360,"Why don't you Ask Elly and Pato, Pocoyo?"
00:11:45.680,00:11:47.400,Help Pocoyo?
00:11:52.200,00:11:53.400,Quack! Quack!
00:11:54.160,00:11:55.720,Ahh-ha!
00:12:00.640,00:12:02.480,"Now, that is a good idea."
00:12:02.880,00:12:11.000,"If Elly and Pato help by turning the rope, you can think clearly about trying to skip."
00:12:22.040,00:12:24.200,"Ooh, they're not ready yet, Pocoyo."
00:12:24.320,00:12:28.200,The rope needs to be turning for you to skip in it.
00:12:41.280,00:12:42.240,That's it.
00:12:42.360,00:12:43.320,Ready?
00:12:43.440,00:12:45.960,"One, two, three."
00:12:52.560,00:12:56.120,"Ah-hah, well-done, Pocoyo."
00:12:56.400,00:12:57.400,You did it.
00:12:57.520,00:12:59.400,You can skip with a rope.
00:12:59.880,00:13:05.400,"You see, Pocoyo, there's nothing wrong with asking for help once in a while."
00:13:05.920,00:13:10.080,"Otherwise, you might just have to skip a lot of the fun."
00:13:14.120,00:13:17.760,"So ends another day with our friend, Pocoyo."
00:13:17.880,00:13:20.760,"Well, maybe we'll just skip a bit more."
00:13:21.240,00:13:23.240,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:13:32.080,00:13:33.720,Pato!
00:13:49.400,00:13:50.720,Loula!
00:13:55.400,00:13:56.680,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:16.640,00:14:18.400,"Oh, sorry."
00:14:18.520,00:14:21.320,"You go back to sleep, Sleepy Bird."
00:14:31.360,00:14:33.920,"Ah, hello, Pocoyo."
00:14:34.320,00:14:35.560,Hi.
00:14:38.120,00:14:40.120,"Sleepy Bird, have you?"
00:14:40.240,00:14:43.560,"I'm afraid she's asleep, as usual."
00:14:45.800,00:14:47.640,"Oh, wait a minute."
00:14:47.760,00:14:49.120,Is she waking up?
00:14:49.240,00:14:53.920,"Oh, no. I think it's something else."
00:15:09.160,00:15:11.200,"Oh, that was so close."
00:15:13.360,00:15:14.880,Ball?
00:15:38.480,00:15:41.080,but it's shaped a little differently.
00:15:42.680,00:15:43.760,Quack!
00:15:50.920,00:15:54.000,Can any of you tell him what that is?
00:16:00.480,00:16:02.400,Egg. Egg.
00:16:03.880,00:16:05.320,Quack!
00:16:11.640,00:16:15.600,"Eggs can break, I'm afraid, Pocoyo, if you're not careful."
00:16:15.720,00:16:20.200,And do you know what's inside that egg waiting to come out?
00:16:20.320,00:16:21.360,Quack!
00:16:25.160,00:16:29.320,"There's a baby bird inside that egg, Pocoyo."
00:16:29.440,00:16:30.720,Baby?
00:16:32.200,00:16:36.880,I had no idea Sleepy Bird was sitting on an egg.
00:16:37.000,00:16:42.920,That egg belongs up there in Sleepy Bird's nest with its mother.
00:16:50.320,00:16:52.880,"Oh, dear. You'd best catch it, Pocoyo."
00:16:53.000,00:16:56.280,Sleepy Bird will be very worried if she wakes up.
00:17:01.560,00:17:03.040,Quack! Quack!
00:17:10.960,00:17:11.920,Quack!
00:17:15.880,00:17:17.840,"Catch it, Pocoyo."
00:17:17.960,00:17:19.600,"Pato, you catch it now."
00:17:21.280,00:17:22.960,"No, it's coming the other way."
00:17:23.240,00:17:24.920,"Quickly, quickly."
00:17:25.880,00:17:28.400,"Uh, Pato, it's behind you."
00:17:28.840,00:17:30.720,"Oh, my word."
00:17:36.480,00:17:38.880,"Oh, well done."
00:17:39.160,00:17:42.680,"Now, if we could just get Sleepy Bird's attention."
00:17:42.800,00:17:43.680,Sleepy Bird...
00:17:46.400,00:17:50.200,"She certainly is a sound sleeper, isn't she?"
00:17:52.800,00:17:58.160,I suppose we'll have to find a way to get it up there ourselves then.
00:18:04.680,00:18:07.800,"Yes, I'm afraid it is quite high up, Pocoyo."
00:18:07.920,00:18:12.320,Perhaps we need someone taller to help us.
00:18:13.160,00:18:14.400,But who?
00:18:14.520,00:18:19.760,Can any of you tell Pocoyo someone who is tall enough to help us?
00:18:51.040,00:18:56.120,That's where an egg belongs: Snug in its nest.
00:18:58.560,00:18:59.680,Hooray for Poco...
00:19:01.560,00:19:04.000,Something's happening to the egg.
00:19:06.440,00:19:07.520,Egg.
00:19:07.640,00:19:08.640,Egg.
00:19:19.840,00:19:21.240,Squawk!
00:19:24.840,00:19:26.040,Come closer now.
00:19:26.160,00:19:28.240,You won't want to miss this.
00:19:39.040,00:19:40.560,Chirp! Chirp!
00:19:52.000,00:20:01.000,"Well, in any case, it looks like we all have a new friend who we'll be seeing more of... If we can catch him, that is."
00:20:02.560,00:20:04.680,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:20:13.640,00:20:15.280,Pato!
00:20:19.720,00:20:20.720,Elly!
00:20:30.960,00:20:32.280,Loula!
00:20:36.960,00:20:38.240,Sleepy Bird!
00:21:05.640,00:21:07.440,Hi.
00:21:11.680,00:21:13.960,"How about, uh... Oh."
00:21:15.760,00:21:18.720,Pocoyo? Pocoyo?
00:21:19.560,00:21:20.760,"Oh, dear."
00:21:20.880,00:21:22.720,Where's Pocoyo?
00:21:22.840,00:21:24.800,"Would you look with me, please?"
00:21:24.920,00:21:27.440,I think I'm going to need your help.
00:21:30.720,00:21:31.520,Hello.
00:21:34.680,00:21:38.320,Can any of you tell me where Pocoyo is?
00:22:07.640,00:22:09.200,Hello.
00:22:12.440,00:22:17.440,"Now, Pocoyo, what do you want to do today?"
00:22:19.600,00:22:20.600,Game!
00:22:23.360,00:22:25.560,Games are great fun.
00:22:25.680,00:22:27.480,What shall we play?
00:22:27.600,00:22:28.960,"Oh, I know."
00:22:29.080,00:22:30.880,How would you like to play...?
00:22:33.320,00:22:35.120,Pocoyo?
00:22:35.720,00:22:38.760,"Oh, wherever could Pocoyo be now?"
00:22:39.880,00:22:40.760,"Oh, I say."
00:22:40.880,00:22:42.560,Maybe he's here.
00:22:42.680,00:22:45.720,"I can't see him, but wait a minute."
00:22:45.840,00:22:47.840,What's that?
00:22:48.000,00:22:50.040,"Pocoyo, is that you?"
00:22:50.120,00:22:50.920,Dear me.
00:22:51.040,00:22:53.640,"It's so far away, it's hard to tell."
00:22:53.760,00:22:55.920,It could be Pocoyo.
00:23:01.920,00:23:06.120,"Hmm, does that look like Pocoyo to you?"
00:23:10.640,00:23:13.520,Pocoyo isn't Green and prickly.
00:23:13.640,00:23:16.720,I think this is a cactus.
00:23:20.200,00:23:23.240,Do you see Pocoyo anywhere?
00:23:27.080,00:23:28.960,Did you see him? Where is he?
00:23:29.080,00:23:33.080,Can any of you tell me where Pocoyo is?
00:23:44.520,00:23:46.240,Nice glasses.
00:23:46.360,00:23:49.960,"Now, how would you like to play a good game of..."
00:23:50.080,00:23:51.240,Pocoyo!
00:23:51.360,00:23:53.080,Come back.
00:23:53.200,00:23:56.840,"Oh, I wonder where Pocoyo went to this time."
00:23:57.480,00:23:59.600,He's not over here.
00:23:59.720,00:24:02.920,And he's not over there either.
00:24:03.040,00:24:06.520,"Hmm, I wonder where he is."
00:24:11.840,00:24:14.520,What do you suppose that is?
00:24:19.680,00:24:23.200,So do any of you know where we are now?
00:24:28.480,00:24:30.000,We're in the sea.
00:24:30.120,00:24:34.280,Maybe Pocoyo is down here with all the fish.
00:24:36.760,00:24:38.680,Wait a minute.
00:24:38.800,00:24:41.120,That fish has arms.
00:24:41.240,00:24:44.320,"Fish don't have arms, do they?"
00:24:50.320,00:24:51.920,You're Pocoyo.
00:25:03.720,00:25:06.120,how would you like to play...
00:25:06.240,00:25:08.400,"Oh, dear."
00:25:14.360,00:25:21.160,"What a nice forest, and what pretty flowers, but I don't see Pocoyo anywhere, do you?"
00:25:21.280,00:25:24.600,What? You do see Pocoyo?
00:25:24.800,00:25:28.440,Can any of you tell me where Pocoyo is?
00:25:38.520,00:25:41.360,Flowers don't have feet.
00:25:43.160,00:25:44.160,Hello.
00:25:48.880,00:25:50.400,Hooray for Pocoyo.
00:25:50.520,00:25:55.480,"Now, then, I did have an idea for a good game we could play."
00:25:56.080,00:26:00.040,How would you like to play hide-and-seek?
00:26:00.160,00:26:02.360,"Uh... Oh, dear."
00:26:02.480,00:26:05.720,That's what we've been playing all along.
00:26:14.680,00:26:16.760,that he's fallen asleep.
00:26:16.880,00:26:19.040,"Sleep tight, Pocoyo."
00:26:19.160,00:26:22.080,Bye-bye. See you soon.
00:00:46.200,00:00:48.920,where our friend Pocoyo lives.
00:00:49.040,00:00:50.640,"Oh, hello, Pocoyo."
00:00:51.640,00:00:53.200,Hello.
00:01:07.160,00:01:10.480,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what it is?
00:01:14.880,00:01:15.760,Umbrella.
00:01:19.280,00:01:21.080,Umbrella!
00:01:28.000,00:01:30.960,Pocoyo wants to find out for himself.
00:01:31.080,00:01:32.840,"Good for you, Pocoyo."
00:01:34.040,00:01:35.680,"All right, now, then."
00:01:35.840,00:01:38.240,"It's a beautiful, sunny..."
00:01:41.560,00:01:45.200,If somewhat windy day.
00:01:55.960,00:01:58.240,"Oh, look, it's Loula."
00:02:44.360,00:02:45.680,Open.
00:02:46.560,00:02:47.960,Closed.
00:02:49.520,00:02:50.320,Open.
00:02:53.720,00:02:55.000,Very good.
00:02:55.200,00:02:57.360,"Whoops, Pocoyo."
00:02:57.720,00:02:59.080,"Oh, dear."
00:03:14.440,00:03:19.240,"Oh, now, how are you ever going to get down from there?"
00:03:22.920,00:03:25.560,"Oh, I see."
00:03:27.320,00:03:32.000,"As I was saying, it's a beautiful, if sometimes quite windy day."
00:03:32.200,00:03:37.080,"Oh, um, yes, Pocoyo, perhaps you should take a better look."
00:03:37.400,00:03:40.280,What could an umbrella be used for?
00:03:54.320,00:03:55.320,Hide.
00:04:33.000,00:04:35.040,"Oh, you think the umbrella moved?"
00:04:35.320,00:04:36.880,Are you sure?
00:04:43.160,00:04:45.240,Pato!
00:04:52.760,00:04:54.520,A house for Pato.
00:05:07.760,00:05:10.880,Maybe Elly knows what an umbrella is for.
00:05:15.440,00:05:17.600,I wonder where Elly is going.
00:05:30.720,00:05:34.160,"Oh, Elly, what a wonderful way to use an umbrella."
00:05:42.800,00:05:47.080,"But I'm afraid we may need it for something else, and soon."
00:05:49.600,00:05:56.600,I think Pocoyo and his friends are about to get wet unless-- Hmm.
00:05:56.720,00:06:00.760,"Pocoyo, can you think of anything that might keep you dry?"
00:06:00.880,00:06:04.200,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what will keep him dry?
00:06:18.400,00:06:20.440,Hooray for Pocoyo.
00:06:24.560,00:06:32.480,"it's, all in all, a breezy, windy, cloudy, rainy, sunny, beautiful day for Pocoyo and his friends."
00:06:32.560,00:06:38.200,And thanks to you and Pocoyo it's also nice and dry!
00:06:38.960,00:06:41.200,Bye now! See you soon!
00:06:49.640,00:06:51.240,Pato!
00:07:07.040,00:07:08.440,Loula!
00:07:12.960,00:07:14.480,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:29.160,00:07:31.360,I just love their music.
00:07:37.080,00:07:38.080,Hello.
00:07:41.280,00:07:43.600,- play some lovely music? - Shh.
00:07:50.320,00:07:52.240,I'll try to be quiet.
00:08:02.760,00:08:04.720,"- Oh, look, it's Pato. - Shh."
00:08:18.320,00:08:20.280,"Who can it be, Pocoyo?"
00:08:20.400,00:08:23.280,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who's coming?
00:08:30.680,00:08:31.520,Shh.
00:09:02.520,00:09:05.360,"I'm afraid they've gone, Pocoyo."
00:09:06.000,00:09:08.120,"Yes, it's too bad."
00:09:08.440,00:09:11.360,"It was beautiful music, wasn't it?"
00:09:14.080,00:09:15.360,More!
00:09:18.040,00:09:19.440,right now.
00:09:20.680,00:09:22.040,"Yes, I know."
00:09:22.320,00:09:26.960,"I wonder if you can think of a way to make more music, Pocoyo."
00:09:34.040,00:09:37.240,"Oh, I think Pocoyo has an idea."
00:09:45.120,00:09:48.120,Pocoyo's brought some musical instruments.
00:09:58.320,00:10:00.680,Just like the ball orchestra plays.
00:10:00.880,00:10:02.840,What a wonderful idea.
00:10:02.960,00:10:05.840,You can play music yourselves.
00:11:06.040,00:11:10.040,"Ooh, look, who's this? It's Sleepy Bird."
00:11:10.360,00:11:12.040,You've woken her up.
00:11:14.400,00:11:21.400,"I think Sleepy Bird was awakened by all the noise-- I-I mean, by all the wonderful music."
00:11:29.720,00:11:37.040,"exactly like the ball orchestra, but one does need a lot of practice to play instruments like those, Pocoyo."
00:11:37.880,00:11:39.560,No music.
00:11:44.440,00:11:47.360,to make music. Music is all around you.
00:11:47.480,00:11:49.800,Just listen for a moment.
00:12:01.000,00:12:04.840,What can you hear that sounds like music?
00:12:57.440,00:13:03.200,"I think the ball orchestra want to play music with you and your friends, Pocoyo."
00:13:04.440,00:13:08.840,"So you see, there are lots of ways to make music."
00:13:09.560,00:13:11.840,"Play along with us, why don't you!"
00:13:11.960,00:13:16.760,Hooray for Pocoyo! Bye! See you soon!
00:13:25.440,00:13:26.840,Pato!
00:13:31.600,00:13:32.640,Elly!
00:13:42.800,00:13:44.160,Loula!
00:13:48.840,00:13:50.160,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:05.360,00:14:10.080,There's nothing more fun than building a nice tall tower.
00:14:21.320,00:14:26.600,It's also a good day for a friend to come over and play.
00:14:28.960,00:14:30.280,Elly!
00:14:50.680,00:14:52.840,"before she arrives, don't you think?"
00:15:00.120,00:15:03.560,"Not so excited about cleaning up, eh?"
00:15:05.960,00:15:07.760,"Oh, a broom."
00:15:08.040,00:15:12.000,"Yes, a broom. Isn't that exciting?"
00:15:16.320,00:15:18.720,really is excited about the broom.
00:15:18.840,00:15:21.160,"Do you know how to use it, Pocoyo?"
00:15:44.800,00:15:46.880,but it does look like fun.
00:15:47.360,00:15:51.160,Do you know what Pocoyo is pretending the broom is?
00:15:55.840,00:15:58.880,Pocoyo is pretending the broom is a horse.
00:16:05.680,00:16:08.920,Cowboy Pocoyo-- that's very good.
00:16:09.280,00:16:30.160,"Yes, that's very good, Pocoyo, but it's not-- Oh, now you're playing ice hockey, and the broom is your hockey stick."
00:16:30.320,00:16:33.200,I always loved ice hockey.
00:16:41.440,00:16:42.840,He scores!
00:16:43.080,00:16:45.840,Pocoyo! Pocoyo!
00:16:45.960,00:16:58.000,"That was just wonderful, Pocoyo, but-- Do any of you know what Pocoyo is pretending the broom is now?"
00:17:17.880,00:17:22.880,"and then you jumped and swoosh, and then all the blocks fell."
00:17:24.120,00:17:26.680,Just so... cool.
00:17:26.960,00:17:30.440,"Hmm, well, that's strange."
00:17:30.920,00:17:35.000,I thought brooms were supposed to make things tidier.
00:17:40.120,00:17:43.160,Wasn't there something we were supposed to be doing?
00:17:44.160,00:17:46.360,"Oh, my, I think I remember now."
00:17:46.480,00:17:49.440,Someone was coming over to play.
00:17:49.600,00:17:51.520,"Now, who was it?"
00:17:52.040,00:17:55.360,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who's coming?
00:18:04.480,00:18:08.240,We've got to clean this mess up and fast.
00:18:10.320,00:18:14.640,"I say, we've got to clean up before Elly arrives."
00:18:18.680,00:18:22.880,"Now, calm down, Pocoyo. just think for a minute."
00:18:33.680,00:18:40.280,"Pocoyo, I'm sorry, but this is no time for-- Oh, I see."
00:18:40.680,00:18:46.920,Pocoyo is putting his horse and his hockey stick...
00:18:52.720,00:18:57.880,and his screaming guitar to work on clearing up.
00:18:58.120,00:19:00.160,What a brilliant idea.
00:19:00.280,00:19:03.240,The blocks are getting tidied up in no time.
00:19:10.400,00:19:12.040,"eh, Pocoyo?"
00:19:29.040,00:19:31.440,a good day for Pocoyo...
00:19:31.960,00:19:37.280,finding out that clearing up can be fun with a little imagination.
00:19:50.360,00:19:52.840,Bye! See you soon.
00:20:05.400,00:20:06.880,Pato!
00:20:11.600,00:20:12.640,Elly!
00:20:22.800,00:20:24.160,Loula!
00:20:28.800,00:20:30.200,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:42.480,00:20:44.760,"Pocoyo, over here."
00:20:45.600,00:20:47.200,Pocoyo?
00:20:48.000,00:20:50.960,"- Hello, Pocoyo. - Hi."
00:20:52.880,00:20:55.680,what do you think you'd like to do today?
00:21:12.720,00:21:15.200,"Do you know what that is, Pocoyo?"
00:21:15.920,00:21:19.320,Can any of you tell Pocoyo what it is?
00:21:27.880,00:21:31.600,I suppose you're trying to work out what it does.
00:21:40.880,00:21:43.680,And sometimes it makes a noise.
00:21:45.600,00:21:48.560,"Yes, exactly. That's what it says."
00:21:51.400,00:21:55.960,"And when it says, ring, ring, it means?"
00:22:04.920,00:22:07.920,"Oh, Pocoyo has an idea."
00:22:11.280,00:22:13.400,"Where are you going, Pocoyo?"
00:22:20.920,00:22:23.440,"What are you doing now, Pocoyo?"
00:22:28.440,00:22:33.000,"You thought the phone might like another ring, ring to talk to."
00:22:33.120,00:22:35.200,What a fun idea.
00:22:35.640,00:22:41.280,But I'm afraid a phone isn't for talking to other things that ring.
00:23:00.200,00:23:03.440,"Oh, dear. I think Pocoyo is upset."
00:23:03.560,00:23:07.720,"Don't give up yet, Pocoyo. Who could you ask for help?"
00:23:07.840,00:23:09.080,Pato.
00:23:16.400,00:23:19.480,And it looks like he's just about to dig in to a snack.
00:23:43.320,00:23:47.560,"I think Pocoyo would like to show you something, Pato."
00:24:24.240,00:24:31.120,"Oh, I think Pato's hungry, and it's very hard for a hungry duck to be patient."
00:24:42.200,00:24:44.400,And now it appears to be talking.
00:24:49.600,00:24:54.640,"Well, why don't you try listening to what it's saying?"
00:24:54.840,00:24:57.680,"Yes, you. Why not?"
00:25:05.160,00:25:09.080,do you know what to say into the phone after it rings?
00:25:09.360,00:25:12.560,"You say, hello?"
00:25:21.440,00:25:22.760,Hello?
00:25:25.640,00:25:27.760,That's what a phone is for.
00:25:27.880,00:25:31.560,"You can talk to friends, even if they're quite far away."
00:25:32.240,00:25:36.280,But I wonder who could be calling you.
00:25:42.120,00:25:44.800,Can any of you tell Pocoyo who it is?
00:25:50.280,00:25:51.480,Elly.
00:26:00.800,00:26:05.800,Isn't the telephone a wonderful way of communicating with your friends?
00:26:07.000,00:26:09.160,"Oh, there you all are."
00:26:09.320,00:26:12.880,"Well, it looks like you're having a splendid time."
00:26:20.080,00:26:22.240,Bye! See you soon.
00:00:48.040,00:00:48.960,Hi.
00:00:56.400,00:00:57.280,Vroom!
00:01:00.680,00:01:02.360,"What is it, Pocoyo?"
00:01:02.640,00:01:04.200,Vrooooom!
00:01:22.840,00:01:25.480,I wonder why he loves it so much.
00:01:28.880,00:01:31.920,"Oh, I think he's going to show us why."
00:01:54.120,00:01:57.680,It looks like Elly wants a turn flying the plane.
00:02:13.200,00:02:15.360,"Do you know how to make it fly, Elly?"
00:02:25.880,00:02:28.120,That's right. You wind it up.
00:02:28.240,00:02:30.680,"But don't wind it up too much, Elly."
00:02:33.840,00:02:34.680,No!
00:02:39.040,00:02:41.560,Look how high it's going.
00:02:44.000,00:02:45.080,Oh.
00:02:48.440,00:02:52.160,How can we find it if we can't even see it?
00:03:01.920,00:03:06.880,"When you look through a telescope, you can see things that are far away."
00:03:07.560,00:03:10.120,Quick Pocoyo. Look through the telescope.
00:03:20.400,00:03:25.680,"Well, it looks like the plane flew all the way up to outer space."
00:03:26.800,00:03:30.960,How will we ever get up to outer space to get it back?
00:03:31.760,00:03:34.080,"Huh! Oh, of course."
00:03:34.280,00:03:35.520,The vamoosh.
00:04:14.280,00:04:15.680,Don't be afraid.
00:04:28.920,00:04:30.640,"Oh, what fun!"
00:04:31.120,00:04:33.640,"But what about your toy plane, Pocoyo?"
00:04:33.760,00:04:36.680,Maybe the aliens know where it is.
00:04:39.160,00:04:40.400,Airplane.
00:05:03.240,00:05:06.680,"I don't think you can reach it up there, Pocoyo..."
00:05:11.080,00:05:13.920,"Do you know anyone who could reach it, Pocoyo?"
00:05:23.400,00:05:24.720,Hmm.
00:05:28.680,00:05:35.800,Can any of you see someone who can stretch right up and help Pocoyo get his plane?
00:05:51.200,00:05:54.120,Our new alien friend did it.
00:05:54.240,00:05:55.880,Hooray!
00:06:12.400,00:06:16.080,"Oh, I think the aliens want to say something."
00:06:17.040,00:06:18.360,Let's have a party?
00:06:32.600,00:06:35.840,Pocoyo has found some new friends too.
00:06:35.960,00:06:37.520,How splendid.
00:06:37.800,00:06:40.160,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:06:56.200,00:06:57.240,Elly!
00:07:13.280,00:07:14.800,Sleepy Bird!
00:07:31.280,00:07:32.480,Shh.
00:07:37.400,00:07:38.280,Quack!
00:07:43.120,00:07:46.800,"Why are we whispering, if you don't mind my asking?"
00:07:58.840,00:08:00.800,You're going to decorate Pocoyo?
00:08:00.920,00:08:02.280,- Quack! - Ugh!
00:08:12.440,00:08:13.640,Oh.
00:08:15.480,00:08:25.800,"I think Pocoyo's friends must be planning something for him, something with a cake and hats and dancing and balloons."
00:08:30.240,00:08:33.560,what Pocoyo's friends are planning for him?
00:08:41.000,00:08:43.640,"But it's not his birthday today, is it?"
00:08:44.640,00:08:47.600,So why are you having a party for him?
00:08:47.880,00:08:49.120,"Oh, I see."
00:08:49.240,00:08:53.000,Is it just to show Pocoyo what a special friend he is?
00:08:55.000,00:08:57.120,"Oh, I can't wait to go and tell him."
00:09:01.440,00:09:04.320,"Oh, you don't want me to tell Pocoyo."
00:09:04.480,00:09:05.560,- No? - Chirp.
00:09:05.680,00:09:07.360,Wait a minute.
00:09:07.480,00:09:10.120,I think I get it now.
00:09:10.360,00:09:13.440,It's going to be a surprise.
00:09:18.240,00:09:19.080,Don't worry.
00:09:19.200,00:09:24.640,"Just you go and get everything ready, and we'll try to keep Pocoyo from finding out."
00:09:34.800,00:09:37.600,"Why, um, hello, Pocoyo."
00:09:37.840,00:09:38.680,Hi.
00:09:42.800,00:09:43.960,You are?
00:09:44.080,00:09:45.160,Quack!
00:09:46.360,00:09:47.720,Friends.
00:09:49.440,00:09:51.640,"I mean, oh... Um, oh."
00:09:51.760,00:09:53.840,You're looking for your friends.
00:09:56.000,00:09:58.880,"Well, um, I certainly haven't seen them."
00:09:59.000,00:10:00.560,"Nope, not one."
00:10:07.200,00:10:08.640,Friends?
00:10:10.920,00:10:13.480,"maybe in the meantime, we could... Uh..."
00:10:14.000,00:10:15.240,Pocoyo?
00:10:15.520,00:10:20.000,"Well, we'd better go and warn his friends that Pocoyo is looking for them."
00:10:20.120,00:10:21.480,"Oh, look."
00:10:21.600,00:10:24.360,Pato and Sleepy Bird are making a cake.
00:10:24.480,00:10:26.600,They have eggs and milk.
00:10:27.320,00:10:28.960,"Oh! Oh, my word."
00:10:29.080,00:10:33.080,"Um, Pato, Sleepy Bird, Pocoyo is coming."
00:10:48.680,00:10:51.520,"eggs, and milk, and a bowl."
00:10:51.640,00:10:54.440,Tsch! I wonder what Pato is doing with that.
00:10:54.560,00:10:56.760,"Probably nothing, no, no."
00:10:59.760,00:11:01.400,Friends!
00:11:03.200,00:11:05.600,"See, no reason to look around this area."
00:11:05.720,00:11:09.880,I'll tell you what. Why don't we take a nice long walk and...
00:11:10.000,00:11:11.640,Elly.
00:11:15.280,00:11:17.200,"Whew, that was close."
00:11:17.320,00:11:18.200,It's all right.
00:11:18.320,00:11:19.600,I think he's gone.
00:11:19.720,00:11:21.680,"- Oh, Pato, look out. - Quack."
00:11:23.080,00:11:26.280,"Pocoyo, what are you doing back here?"
00:11:32.280,00:11:34.160,Weren't you going to see Elly?
00:11:37.680,00:11:38.880,Elly.
00:11:43.840,00:11:48.440,"Come on, we'd better hurry to warn Elly before Pocoyo gets there."
00:11:50.680,00:11:56.040,It looks like Elly and Loula are putting together some decorations for the surprise.
00:11:56.160,00:11:58.160,"Elly, we're just in time."
00:11:58.280,00:12:00.080,"Quick, Pocoyo's coming."
00:12:11.600,00:12:12.840,Elly?
00:12:13.120,00:12:14.680,Elly.
00:12:15.360,00:12:16.560,Elly.
00:12:16.680,00:12:18.520,Friends!
00:12:23.600,00:12:25.760,there's no elephant around here.
00:12:30.280,00:12:31.360,He's gone.
00:12:36.280,00:12:40.560,"Oh, I just can't wait to surprise our little friend Pocoyo."
00:12:51.800,00:12:54.480,"Don't feel too bad, Pocoyo."
00:12:55.040,00:13:00.560,"Well, can any of you tell Pocoyo where he might find his friends?"
00:13:08.560,00:13:13.800,for no particular reason other than just to show a friend that you care.
00:13:13.920,00:13:15.600,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:13:15.720,00:13:20.040,"Hooray for surprises, and hooray for friends!"
00:13:31.360,00:13:32.960,Pato!
00:13:37.520,00:13:38.560,Elly!
00:13:54.600,00:13:56.120,Sleepy Bird!
00:14:09.680,00:14:11.240,"Hello there, Pocoyo."
00:14:11.360,00:14:13.040,"Hello, Pato."
00:14:17.840,00:14:19.960,Do any of you know what it is?
00:14:28.520,00:14:30.680,so red and bouncy.
00:14:30.920,00:14:32.200,Is it a new one?
00:14:34.600,00:14:38.520,I think Baby Bird rather likes the ball too.
00:14:39.360,00:14:41.200,"Hello, Baby Bird."
00:14:41.480,00:14:43.040,Chirp!
00:14:47.080,00:14:49.160,"a new ball, is there?"
00:15:08.320,00:15:09.520,Quack!
00:15:25.080,00:15:28.000,I believe Baby Bird would like to play with you.
00:15:41.040,00:15:45.520,Pocoyo and Pato think he's too little to play with their ball.
00:16:01.080,00:16:02.080,Quack!
00:16:39.800,00:16:41.560,Where's he gone now?
00:16:41.680,00:16:47.640,Can any of you tell Pato and Pocoyo where Baby Bird is?
00:17:00.280,00:17:02.040,He's flying away.
00:17:02.160,00:17:04.880,However will you get your ball back now?
00:17:42.480,00:17:43.560,Quack!
00:17:51.880,00:17:52.960,Baby Bird!
00:18:01.560,00:18:02.680,Quack!
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.120,Quack!
00:18:06.680,00:18:08.720,Quack! Quack! Quack-quack!
00:19:07.760,00:19:13.400,What should Pocoyo and Pato do to make Baby Bird feel happy again?
00:19:30.120,00:19:31.240,Gulp!
00:19:40.080,00:19:48.000,There's something even better than a new ball: making a friend feel happy.
00:19:48.840,00:19:49.840,"Oh, well."
00:19:49.960,00:19:53.280,Looks like all three of them are having a ball now.
00:19:57.000,00:19:59.640,Bye-bye! See you soon.
00:20:10.280,00:20:11.880,Pato!
00:20:16.440,00:20:17.480,Elly!
00:20:27.680,00:20:29.080,Loula!
00:20:33.520,00:20:35.040,Sleepy Bird!
00:20:47.600,00:20:49.120,"Hello, Pocoyo."
00:20:52.200,00:20:53.640,Pocoyo?
00:20:53.760,00:20:54.960,Pocoyo?
00:20:55.080,00:20:56.480,No.
00:20:59.160,00:21:00.320,Not Pocoyo.
00:21:03.600,00:21:05.840,"Well, then, who are you?"
00:21:08.480,00:21:12.680,Can any of you tell me what Pocoyo is today?
00:21:22.360,00:21:24.880,"the cape, the p."
00:21:27.280,00:21:29.480,Super Pocoyo.
00:21:50.360,00:21:55.120,"Wow, you certainly are being a superhero, Pocoyo."
00:22:01.320,00:22:05.320,"Pato, I think Pocoyo wants you to play with him."
00:22:09.000,00:22:11.800,Super Pocoyo and super Pato!
00:22:25.560,00:22:27.880,Super Pocoyo help friends!
00:22:33.920,00:22:41.120,"Wow, super Pocoyo is using his super vision to spot someone who needs his help."
00:22:59.480,00:23:02.360,"You know, Pato, Pocoyo's a superhero."
00:23:02.480,00:23:04.440,He knows what he's doing.
00:23:06.560,00:23:08.680,Super Pocoyo!
00:23:37.200,00:23:38.680,Loula?
00:24:03.720,00:24:05.240,Super Pocoyo!
00:24:26.560,00:24:28.640,she's just having a rest.
00:24:29.560,00:24:31.880,"No, Elly stuck."
00:24:32.000,00:24:33.880,Super Pocoyo!
00:24:50.400,00:24:51.480,Super...
00:24:55.680,00:24:56.920,Pocoyo.
00:25:03.240,00:25:04.480,But don't you see?
00:25:04.600,00:25:06.720,Pocoyo was just pretending to...
00:25:09.520,00:25:11.240,"Oh, dear, Pato."
00:25:11.360,00:25:16.800,"I don't think Pocoyo is feeling so super after all now, is he?"
00:25:16.920,00:25:19.200,Maybe you should go and cheer him up.
00:25:23.480,00:25:24.520,Pato?
00:25:24.760,00:25:27.080,"Oh, Pato, it's your hat."
00:25:28.560,00:25:30.760,Pato can't see where he's going.
00:25:39.520,00:25:44.720,"Oh, there must be someone somewhere who can help Pato."
00:26:00.360,00:26:04.920,Can any of you think of anyone who could help Pato?
00:26:35.080,00:26:38.560,This has been a super day after all.
00:26:38.800,00:26:41.120,Hooray for Pocoyo!
00:26:41.280,00:26:43.600,Bye-bye. See you soon.
