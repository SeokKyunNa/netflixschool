00:02:03.540,00:02:06.584,"You are aware of the fact that someone was killed on your property yesterday, correct?"
00:02:06.668,00:02:09.379,"Yeah, listen, I've got some diplomatic papers to go over..."
00:02:09.462,00:02:11.464,"Okay, that's fine..."
00:02:13.049,00:02:16.094,There's a lot of people here that are concerned about your welfare.
00:02:16.177,00:02:20.265,"You're a well-respected man, as far as I know, and have always been."
00:02:20.348,00:02:23.143,And I'd like to help resolve this with you.
00:02:23.226,00:02:25.562,-I will make no deal. -No deal?
00:02:25.645,00:02:26.813,I'm sorry. No deal.
00:02:26.896,00:02:31.025,I'm in charge around here and that's the way it's going to be.
00:02:31.109,00:02:33.778,We have to... we have to discuss the fact...
00:02:33.862,00:02:35.655,I don't want to talk about your diplomatic papers.
00:02:35.738,00:02:38.783,"We have to discuss that a man was shot, was killed on your property yesterday."
00:02:38.867,00:02:41.703,You have no right to tell a head-of-state what to do.
00:02:41.786,00:02:45.874,We keep skipping over the issue. We have to get to the issue at hand.
00:02:45.957,00:02:48.960,The issue at hand is an international war is about to be had. So...
00:02:49.043,00:02:52.422,I'm not leaving this house right for the moment until I'm through.
00:14:51.098,00:14:53.475,"What are the long-range goals for, uh..."
00:14:53.559,00:14:56.061,Dave Schultz looking toward the next year or two?
00:16:09.635,00:16:12.805,"One night, very late, around 2:00 a.m..."
00:16:12.888,00:16:16.475,"the phone rang, I was already asleep."
00:16:16.558,00:16:18.560,The phone was in the bedroom.
00:16:18.644,00:16:21.063,I pick up the phone...
00:16:22.022,00:16:25.359,and on the other end someone is speaking to me in Russian.
00:16:25.442,00:16:32.282,"Dave asked me, Valo, can you come to the United States?"
00:16:52.970,00:16:55.973,"We were one family, one big family."
00:16:56.056,00:16:59.893,Our kids were growing up together.
00:16:59.977,00:17:02.354,And the conditions were wonderful.
00:20:21.053,00:20:23.388,You're doing a good job.
00:20:23.472,00:20:25.182,Coming across very well.
00:20:27.935,00:20:29.645,"Well, that's difficult."
00:20:52.918,00:20:54.628,And I just did get that off you.
00:24:25.881,00:24:31.344,"Your background, your childhood, has definitely been different."
00:24:31.428,00:24:34.514,How has that affected the work that you do as a coach?
00:28:24.702,00:28:28.498,"Going down to watch Eagle kick some ass in Cali, Colombia."
00:28:29.499,00:28:30.542,We're psyched.
00:41:14.972,00:41:19.435,The last year there was noticeable tension.
00:41:20.686,00:41:22.188,It was...
00:41:24.565,00:41:26.567,like that. I can't tell you...
00:41:27.902,00:41:29.904,what was in his head.
01:06:19.100,01:06:22.144,"I was driving fast, speeding, so I could get back and see..."
01:06:22.228,01:06:26.524,And I prayed...
01:06:27.733,01:06:29.902,that Dave would be alive.
01:06:40.621,01:06:42.707,"-Hello? -Mr. du Pont, sir."
01:06:42.790,01:06:47.712,"-Uh, what do you want? -Uh, basically to resolve the situation."
01:06:47.795,01:06:56.012,"Um, His Holiness is under siege here and the thing is I want to get the thing resolved, and get the lights off the lawn here and a few other things that are annoying me."
01:06:56.095,01:06:58.806,There was the Holy property here. Get out of here.
01:06:58.889,01:07:01.058,Why not stay on the line? We'll try to resolve this.
01:07:01.142,01:07:03.269,-No! Goodbye. -Mr. du Pont?
01:09:42.970,01:09:46.098,"Lieutenant, why would this man be allowed to go to sleep?"
01:10:09.205,01:10:10.372,Did you live there?
01:10:11.540,01:10:13.375,Did you shoot with him or practice with him?
01:10:15.753,01:10:22.760,"Would it be fair to say that a lot of the people whose guns are trained on him are wearing bullet proof vests, vests that he provided, and, uh..."
01:10:47.243,01:10:48.994,Get the heat turned on over there.
01:10:49.078,01:10:53.624,"Yeah, but I don't know if we could send a maintenance guy in to the property to do that."
01:10:53.707,01:10:56.418,"Well, then would you allow me to go over and take a look at the thing?"
01:10:56.502,01:11:00.673,I would have to let the people know that are out there that you are going to do that...
01:11:00.756,01:11:03.717,so that you don't get hurt or no one gets hurt.
01:11:03.801,01:11:06.971,"Well, no one would be hurt. I would just go over myself."
01:11:07.054,01:11:09.431,"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll talk to my bosses..."
01:11:09.515,01:11:11.684,You talk to your bosses first and call me back...
01:11:11.767,01:11:17.106,"Okay, well, believe it or not, they're on another line for me and they told me that that's okay."
01:11:17.189,01:11:20.317,All right. I'll go out the garden door.
01:11:20.401,01:11:22.361,"Okay, are you going to be armed?"
01:11:22.444,01:11:23.570,-No. -Okay.
01:11:23.654,01:11:25.364,"Please don't come out armed, okay?"
01:11:25.447,01:11:27.825,"-No, I won't. -Okay."
01:11:27.908,01:11:30.035,"All right, I will be dressed in black."
01:11:30.119,01:11:31.620,You're dressed in black.
01:11:31.704,01:11:34.373,With my Bulgarian colors showing the flag.
01:18:05.305,01:18:07.349,It was a very difficult period.
01:18:08.392,01:18:09.476,Nobody knew...
01:18:10.352,01:18:11.978,where they would go.
01:18:14.398,01:18:19.027,"In Bulgaria, during that time, there was political unrest and the government was unstable."
01:18:20.153,01:18:23.323,My first thought was how I was going to make it...
01:18:25.784,01:18:28.912,My family and my kids...
01:18:28.995,01:18:34.167,how can I give them the best possible education and upbringing?
01:25:12.732,01:25:17.570,"Most of the time I'm sad because of the situation, and where we are now, at this moment."
01:25:19.322,01:25:22.951,Alexander and the family will always be close to me.
01:25:23.034,01:25:26.496,The Schultz's will always stay close to my heart.
00:00:19.269,00:00:22.605,"There's horses on both sides, all over the place."
00:00:24.858,00:00:27.610,This main drive is just so pretty.
00:00:33.867,00:00:36.286,And this is up to the top of the hill.
00:00:43.126,00:00:46.379,if you take a left here and you take this road...
00:00:46.463,00:00:49.632,"right down this road, it leads to our house."
00:00:51.801,00:00:55.889,There's our sweet old house. And we've had a lot of fun here.
00:03:17.989,00:03:26.748,"in the rolling woodland of Pennsylvania, on a 1,000-acre estate that the du Pont family have called home for three quarters of a century."
00:03:26.831,00:03:31.127,Nestling among the trees are the purpose-built headquarters of Team Foxcatcher.
00:03:36.049,00:03:37.634,approximately 30 years ago.
00:03:37.717,00:03:49.229,"In that time, John supported swimming, triathlon, pentathlon and many number of athletes in all their endeavors to be world and Olympic champions."
00:03:49.312,00:03:54.317,My goal is to teach the youth of America...
00:03:56.069,00:04:01.449,"not only to become champions in sport, but to become champions in life."
00:04:01.532,00:04:02.533,Thank you.
00:04:04.369,00:04:07.956,I'd like to draw your attention to the double doors where most of you entered...
00:04:08.039,00:04:13.378,where Mr. John du Pont will do the official ribbon cutting.
00:04:15.546,00:04:24.472,"Let me congratulate John du Pont on his constant, everlasting, generous philanthropy."
00:04:28.101,00:04:31.020,"was the equivalent of our royal family, so to speak."
00:04:31.104,00:04:33.064,And he was the prince.
00:04:35.650,00:04:39.821,"In my younger days, I saw John for the first time, walking down the pool deck."
00:04:40.488,00:04:51.624,"It was like, there's the picture of someone who's fit, athletic, healthy, vibrant, and, you know, seemed like a guy who had a passion for life and doing good things for people."
00:04:58.589,00:05:00.800,"56:02, Dave. That's good."
00:05:03.720,00:05:05.722,developed all these facilities...
00:05:05.805,00:05:07.932,"and then, you know, he discovered wrestling."
00:05:20.987,00:05:22.822,Yes! Yes!
00:05:37.378,00:05:42.842,"I don't remember, really, why John became as interested in wrestling as he did."
00:05:42.925,00:05:46.012,I know his mother was very much against it.
00:05:46.095,00:05:49.057,"He tried it when he was a kid, you know, in high school."
00:05:49.140,00:05:51.267,"And part of it, I think, was rebellion."
00:05:51.350,00:05:54.771,'Cause wrestling was one of those sports that his parents didn't want him to do.
00:05:54.854,00:05:58.900,Wrestling is a sport for ruffians. Wrestling is a sport for the underclass.
00:06:02.570,00:06:04.781,"and be a part of that culture which, you know..."
00:06:04.864,00:06:06.699,Those guys are tough.
00:06:13.706,00:06:16.292,'84 Olympic Champion...
00:06:16.375,00:06:19.170,seven-time national champion.
00:06:19.253,00:06:22.965,"A wealth of experience out there on the mat, Mark Scott."
00:06:30.348,00:06:33.017,Dave really just embodied the spirit of the sport.
00:06:33.101,00:06:36.479,"Yeah, Dave was... Dave was different."
00:06:36.562,00:06:38.189,"I mean, he was sort of a hippie."
00:06:41.275,00:06:45.404,It's the palagi. Here's the waves.
00:06:45.488,00:06:47.949,What's the other one we do?
00:06:51.744,00:06:54.956,Little fishies and sharks.
00:07:00.211,00:07:02.421,"When I first met him, I asked him, What do you do?"
00:07:02.505,00:07:03.673,"And he was like, I wrestle."
00:07:03.756,00:07:10.346,"And I remember going to his room, and I'm seeing these trophies, like, world trophies and pictures of the Soviet Union and all this."
00:07:10.430,00:07:12.682,"I'm like, Wait, you don't just wrestle. You're really good."
00:07:12.765,00:07:13.975,"And he's like, Yeah, I like it."
00:07:21.190,00:07:22.733,"his success in wrestling, and I was okay with that."
00:07:22.817,00:07:25.611,I wanted to be a partner in that process.
00:07:25.695,00:07:28.656,"So, all of a sudden, we were all over the world."
00:07:33.661,00:07:36.956,He's gonna run up that hill he just filmed from.
00:07:40.334,00:07:45.214,"that used to hobble along, the goofy grin and the shuffle and..."
00:07:45.298,00:07:48.718,"kind of, the little handshake."
00:07:48.801,00:07:53.890,"Before he'd step out to wrestle, he'd look like, This guy's, like, 80 years old and can barely walk."
00:07:53.973,00:07:59.061,And then you stepped out on the mat with him and saw those two different sides to his persona.
00:07:59.145,00:08:02.982,"You know, it's a pretty interesting human being."
00:08:10.406,00:08:14.702,"But, you know, a genius freak when it came to wrestling, you know."
00:08:14.785,00:08:23.836,And ask him any question you wanted about wrestling and he could give you ten different answers that all were effective solutions to whatever problem you had.
00:08:24.545,00:08:27.089,And that rolls your leg off his shoulder.
00:08:29.467,00:08:35.056,Get his legs off of you by dropping this leg out and throwin' him off with this foot. Turn belly down.
00:08:35.139,00:08:36.724,And he's dust.
00:08:43.981,00:08:47.235,Hey! Violent Violet here. The Violent Violet here in Russia.
00:08:54.492,00:08:57.036,I think he just really appreciated the culture.
00:08:57.119,00:08:58.621,'Cause they're passionate about wrestling.
00:08:58.704,00:09:00.248,"You know, Dave was passionate about wrestling."
00:09:01.666,00:09:06.337,"You know, and then, of course, Dave kinda learned the language a little bit so he can kinda communicate with them."
00:09:06.420,00:09:09.423,"And he was, you know, picking their brains."
00:09:12.134,00:09:14.428,'cause he wanted to hear what the Russian coaches were saying.
00:09:14.512,00:09:16.013,'Cause they're the best coaches in the world.
00:09:16.097,00:09:18.182,What are they saying?
00:09:18.266,00:09:21.561,"Russia's got, like, 40, 50 world championships."
00:09:22.353,00:09:24.814,They only started in the '50s.
00:09:24.897,00:09:28.150,"But once they started, they were dominant."
00:09:31.362,00:09:34.407,in favor of the Soviet Union over the United States.
00:09:38.828,00:09:43.332,"when our guys got to a certain age level, they had to drop out of the sport in order to support their families."
00:09:44.125,00:09:49.130,"Whereas the foreign countries, in Russia and the Eastern Bloc countries, it was a career for those guys."
00:09:49.213,00:09:51.841,"And so, it put us at a huge disadvantage."
00:09:59.348,00:10:02.393,"All those years I had coached, we were second, second, second."
00:10:02.476,00:10:05.396,We just couldn't get over the hump to beat the Soviets.
00:10:26.667,00:10:29.670,came into the picture and changed it.
00:10:29.754,00:10:32.590,He was introduced as a philanthropist...
00:10:32.673,00:10:41.641,"that, uh, was interested in supporting and helping wrestling in a time when we really, really needed the help at U.S.A. Wrestling, financially."
00:10:48.856,00:10:50.691,And that was part of the deal.
00:10:50.775,00:10:53.444,But the real deal was the farm.
00:11:06.749,00:11:07.792,Do you like wrestling?
00:11:14.090,00:11:15.633,It's shaping up pretty well.
00:11:19.553,00:11:23.307,to come live in the houses and paid them a salary to be on his team.
00:11:27.895,00:11:30.856,Come on out to Pennsylvania as soon as you can. You know?
00:11:30.940,00:11:36.946,"I want you to see the farm and see the facilities, and I'd like to talk to you about coming out there."
00:11:40.616,00:11:42.952,Welcome. We hope you have a pleasant stay.
00:11:43.035,00:11:45.371,"And please, fly us again soon."
00:11:46.997,00:11:49.708,"He had a limo pick me up. So, that was pretty amazing."
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.252,"Took me to the farm, dropped me off."
00:11:51.335,00:11:53.963,"And, of course, you come onto the farm and it's pretty much overwhelming."
00:11:55.131,00:11:59.552,"I didn't know much about du Ponts themselves, you know, the family and their history."
00:11:59.635,00:12:04.849,"But it sure wakes you up quickly with, Wow, we're talking some serious wealth here."
00:12:10.396,00:12:11.689,Robbie's running with the horses.
00:12:19.864,00:12:22.908,"Hi-ho, hi-ho, hi-ho, off to wrestle we go."
00:12:29.206,00:12:35.421,"Three 50 x 50 mats, and there was a weight room, and a locker room, and offices and..."
00:12:35.504,00:12:37.298,"I mean, it was amazing."
00:12:42.636,00:12:45.097,"-Hi, everyone Dan knows. -Yeah."
00:12:49.435,00:12:51.353,"And he said, Yeah, here you go. That was it."
00:12:51.437,00:12:52.480,"Okay, bud."
00:12:52.563,00:13:04.241,"Not like when I was at Arizona State, diggin' under my floor mats in my old van looking for quarters so I can buy a Big Mac on a coupon, two for one, $1.25."
00:13:04.325,00:13:06.869,"Now, it's kind of whatever you want."
00:13:12.708,00:13:17.838,"with some of the hindrances that these athletes have, then they can concentrate on training."
00:13:17.922,00:13:24.386,"I believe, with John's continued support, that one day, the U.S. will be the number-one wrestling power in the world."
00:13:27.890,00:13:32.061,"And so, we thought, Well, this is it. This is what we need to be the best."
00:13:35.814,00:13:37.274,This is gonna be real hard.
00:13:41.362,00:13:44.949,"the best wrestlers in the world, the best coaches in the world."
00:13:45.032,00:13:47.326,I really didn't believe him at first.
00:13:50.621,00:13:52.206,"And I said, Really?"
00:13:52.289,00:13:54.750,"As soon as he said that, I said, Okay, I'm in, you know..."
00:14:11.350,00:14:15.271,And I got... Dave Schultz on the telephone.
00:14:18.774,00:14:26.240,"He saw that this guy, this du Pont guy, had been funding some swimming and some, you know, other events, and he thought, Maybe we have an opportunity here to grow our sport."
00:14:27.241,00:14:28.450,My name's Dave Schultz.
00:14:28.534,00:14:33.956,"My involvement here at, uh... Foxcatcher is as an athlete."
00:14:34.039,00:14:38.544,"I, uh... I train here, I work with du Pont and Humphrey."
00:14:38.627,00:14:41.088,They put a training program together for me.
00:14:41.171,00:14:43.549,"And, uh, I also assist in other ways."
00:14:43.632,00:14:49.555,"I... help out with athletes, coaching, and, uh... that's about it."
00:14:57.354,00:15:02.234,I want to be the world champion in 1991 and the Olympic champion in 1992.
00:15:03.944,00:15:05.362,And then I want to quit.
00:15:17.416,00:15:19.418,But you know what? He was the money.
00:15:20.210,00:15:27.843,"Dave was really the charisma, the character, the person that attracted everybody around the world to Foxcatcher."
00:15:37.895,00:15:43.692,when Valentin Jordanov agreed to leave Bulgaria and come and join team Foxcatcher for a couple of years.
00:15:48.030,00:15:51.533,Team Foxcatcher is good friend.
00:15:51.617,00:15:52.743,Okay?
00:15:56.997,00:16:00.501,"The first time he got on top of me, he just grabbed me and picked me up."
00:16:00.584,00:16:01.752,Off the mat.
00:16:01.835,00:16:03.879,"I'm going, Holy shit, this guy's a little guy."
00:16:03.963,00:16:05.422,How did that... That can't happen!
00:16:06.215,00:16:08.384,This guy's special.
00:16:37.162,00:16:39.748,"You know, they had a common bond. Dave could speak Russian."
00:16:39.832,00:16:42.960,Valo didn't necessarily speak the greatest English.
00:16:45.838,00:16:52.886,"There's Yancho and Alexander, the Bulgarian and the American, playing naked together in the morning."
00:16:59.977,00:17:02.271,And the conditions were wonderful.
00:17:04.940,00:17:06.859,Zdravka...
00:17:06.942,00:17:09.528,Valentin. Photograph.
00:17:12.322,00:17:19.747,"You know, Dave was kinda like the main house because, you know, I look at Alexander and Danny and Nancy as family."
00:17:21.123,00:17:23.292,-Danny. Danny Rose. -We're a little cramped on space.
00:17:23.375,00:17:26.670,Hi. You helpin' Mom? Xander's helping.
00:17:26.754,00:17:29.173,"Oh, we're all helping. Isn't that swell?"
00:17:31.467,00:17:32.885,I'm gonna have one more of these before I leave.
00:17:40.559,00:17:43.479,"that had people living in those houses, and they were all wrestlers."
00:17:43.562,00:17:49.276,"And so, I'd get out there and go from one house to the next house and hang out and talk and party."
00:17:56.825,00:18:00.579,"once people came and everybody started training together, it truly was a sports utopia."
00:18:01.246,00:18:06.210,These families and athletes... It was something you only dream of.
00:18:27.272,00:18:31.151,"there's really no way we can ever thank him, except for just saying thank you."
00:18:31.235,00:18:36.990,We really have a lot of affection for him and he's become one of our best friends over the years that we've known him.
00:18:37.074,00:18:41.370,"That's a real important part of it, you know, the friendship that he has with all of his athletes."
00:18:53.006,00:18:55.425,"What do you think, Eagle?"
00:18:55.509,00:18:57.886,On to the world championships and to win.
00:18:57.970,00:19:00.347,"Kill, kill, kill."
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.976,Yeah!
00:19:17.656,00:19:21.910,we had athletes who could stay with the sport longer.
00:19:21.994,00:19:23.537,Because they could afford to do it.
00:19:42.014,00:19:43.098,That's my dream.
00:19:43.182,00:19:47.644,It's for America to be the best of the best.
00:19:49.730,00:19:52.941,-Let's throw the fox in the pool. -Yeah!
00:20:25.265,00:20:27.851,"If I try too hard to do something, I foul it up."
00:20:29.728,00:20:31.480,It's like a person when they wrestle.
00:20:31.563,00:20:35.442,"If they try to do something right, they'll foul up the move."
00:20:35.525,00:20:39.571,If they do it instinctively... they get it right.
00:20:42.658,00:20:46.119,"And score on their opponent, much to their surprise."
00:20:48.038,00:20:59.299,"See, you get stuff like that from me, just off the cuff, that you can use, and things like that are-- That's why I... That's why I continued on."
00:21:01.718,00:21:05.222,"If you just let me, if I were to ramble on, you'd get all sorts of stuff."
00:21:13.355,00:21:17.442,The conversation about John being eccentric was always out-front.
00:21:17.526,00:21:21.405,"You know, John is a little different. There's no doubt about it, you know."
00:21:21.488,00:21:23.991,Does that mean he's a bad guy?
00:21:24.074,00:21:27.327,A lot of the things he did were... weird.
00:21:33.917,00:21:38.755,"And everyone thought that he had just... was going too fast, ended up in the pond."
00:21:46.263,00:21:52.269,"and the next day, he had a high-up official in wrestling..."
00:21:52.352,00:21:58.608,"He told him to get in the backseat, and he did the exact same thing, drove the thing into the pond."
00:21:58.692,00:22:01.862,"Now, why? Who the heck knows?"
00:22:01.945,00:22:07.659,"Now, certainly, that was an abnormal behavior, and we all saw it and we thought, Man, isn't that funny?"
00:22:07.743,00:22:10.871,"You know, he drove his car into the lake. Brand-new Lincoln."
00:22:15.208,00:22:17.502,"Hey, there, Robbie."
00:22:17.586,00:22:19.588,"Hey, Merry Christmas."
00:22:19.671,00:22:22.841,"Go fast, wrestle hard."
00:22:25.552,00:22:30.474,"there was the normal John and then there was the John that's just, you know, you don't know what you're gonna get that day."
00:22:30.557,00:22:35.687,And people would walk on pins and needles not knowing what to expect.
00:22:37.522,00:22:38.607,Sir.
00:22:44.279,00:22:47.032,all in the same experience for better or worse.
00:22:47.115,00:22:51.745,"On the days when John du Pont was up and feeling really good, then spirits were great."
00:22:51.828,00:22:56.249,"When John was down or acting whacky, then you'd better, you know, kind of..."
00:22:58.543,00:23:00.045,John's on a rampage.
00:23:00.128,00:23:01.671,...as in Nobakov.
00:23:03.215,00:23:04.883,"Yeah, he's a little strange."
00:23:04.966,00:23:07.803,And Dave always saw the good in the guy.
00:23:07.886,00:23:11.598,He was the guy who could talk to du Pont on a normal level all the time.
00:23:11.681,00:23:17.145,"And if you needed somethin' and you were afraid to contact John about it, Dave would do it for you."
00:23:20.941,00:23:30.033,"in a positive direction, and the one person who could keep things on the right path so that it continued to benefit the sport and it continued to benefit Dave."
00:23:35.747,00:23:41.795,"We got the Eagle, Atana Kazuchi, the mallet head, and the little paisan."
00:23:45.215,00:23:50.137,and then he was also like a scared kid that never really had a childhood.
00:23:50.220,00:23:54.099,"And you could see that, that he wanted to be part of the team."
00:23:54.182,00:23:56.268,He wanted to be one of the guys.
00:24:09.114,00:24:10.282,so he can soar a little higher.
00:24:19.833,00:24:21.751,His family didn't see him much.
00:24:21.835,00:24:24.004,He said the wrestlers were his family.
00:24:35.974,00:24:37.767,That's a difficult question to answer.
00:24:38.685,00:24:39.769,Uh...
00:24:39.853,00:24:42.522,"You assume one thing, and I know something else."
00:24:55.493,00:25:02.834,"Told me himself that he had his meals in his own room, fed by a maid, until he was, like, 13 or somethin'."
00:25:07.088,00:25:10.300,So I get the sense he-- There was some loneliness growing up.
00:25:12.010,00:25:15.472,"His father had divorced and moved somewhere, I think."
00:25:19.184,00:25:20.560,to be able to talk to your father.
00:25:20.644,00:25:23.480,I'd have to set up an appointment to see my father.
00:25:23.563,00:25:25.899,And half the time he wouldn't see me anyway.
00:25:35.367,00:25:40.455,He didn't have the socialization that kids develop naturally.
00:25:40.538,00:25:44.084,"You know, when you're in your own neighborhood as a kid, and meeting the kid next door."
00:25:44.167,00:25:45.919,He didn't have that.
00:25:47.045,00:25:49.464,He just had his mom around mostly.
00:25:51.174,00:25:53.301,Welcome to Foxcatcher Farms.
00:25:53.385,00:25:59.683,This room is the main trophy room where a lot of our sports trophies are housed.
00:25:59.766,00:26:03.520,Mother is now going to be 90 years old in June.
00:26:03.603,00:26:07.482,Her original... ribbons are here in this room someplace.
00:26:15.365,00:26:19.286,"And then when she passed away, you know, there was a big void."
00:26:25.000,00:26:30.547,"-Yeah, Merry Christmas. -Merry-- Happy New Year. Wrestle hard, wrestle fast."
00:26:32.674,00:26:35.385,and they would come up to the big house during Christmases.
00:26:35.468,00:26:38.722,They were the family to John at that point in time.
00:26:41.266,00:26:42.767,How do you like turtle soup?
00:26:42.851,00:26:44.352,I don't like it at all.
00:26:50.275,00:26:57.282,"he just called the house, and said, Hey, Nancy, I don't think we have a high chair in the house, so remember to bring a high chair."
00:26:57.365,00:26:58.992,And it really warmed my heart.
00:26:59.075,00:27:03.330,He wanted to make that Christmas day something nice.
00:27:03.413,00:27:06.249,"Something nice not only for him, but something nice for my kids."
00:27:11.755,00:27:13.715,that really was trying to connect.
00:27:13.798,00:27:15.383,Soar high together.
00:27:15.467,00:27:18.678,"So I felt like, and I know Dave did, we kinda wanted to befriend the guy."
00:27:18.762,00:27:20.347,Especially if he was willing to help the sport.
00:27:20.430,00:27:25.101,So you kind of felt like you should reach out to him 'cause he's reachin' out to the sport.
00:27:35.153,00:27:37.072,"I think he's, uh..."
00:27:37.155,00:27:42.077,"I kind of look at him more as one of the athletes, I guess, than anything else."
00:27:42.160,00:27:43.995,"You know, he likes to do the same things we do."
00:27:44.079,00:27:46.247,He likes to come in and wrestle and have fun.
00:27:46.331,00:27:49.000,"This doesn't work too well, I'm afraid."
00:27:59.302,00:28:04.099,"and who's trying to take you apart every day in a wrestling practice, which is what you want. And then, you know..."
00:28:04.182,00:28:12.023,"You could work out with John and he's, you know, say a 55-year-old guy, um, kind of frail, you know, kind of slow, a little bit timid."
00:28:13.525,00:28:17.153,"And so, you'd wrestle with him, you'll let him score a bit, you know."
00:28:17.237,00:28:19.197,It was kind of like play-wrestling.
00:28:19.864,00:28:23.368,"And in his own mind, he's, Yeah, I'm hanging with these guys."
00:28:23.451,00:28:24.619,All right.
00:28:34.295,00:28:36.548,John... couldn't wrestle.
00:28:51.688,00:28:54.232,Let go of his-- I told him to let go.
00:28:54.315,00:28:55.400,He's gonna get pinned now.
00:28:55.483,00:28:57.235,Let go of his head!
00:28:57.318,00:29:00.280,"Belly down, belly down, belly down. Oh!"
00:29:01.531,00:29:03.074,Oh!
00:29:12.709,00:29:16.087,and part of his duties were obviously that.
00:29:16.171,00:29:18.256,That's why he coached John.
00:29:18.339,00:29:27.348,"Well, you wanna see that better way to roll-- I like to do it another way. But go ahead."
00:29:27.432,00:29:33.146,"Okay, if you can, shove his head down then step over his head and lock."
00:29:44.949,00:29:47.827,"He could understand it, but he just..."
00:29:47.911,00:29:49.704,Down into his cells in his body...
00:29:49.788,00:29:53.875,"It takes something else, and he never had that."
00:29:58.046,00:29:59.547,Get your arm out of there!
00:29:59.631,00:30:03.259,"Oh, that was it. That was it."
00:30:12.268,00:30:15.688,like the world champions that he employed and had in his club.
00:30:15.772,00:30:19.984,"And so he started a new style, essentially, called the Masters."
00:30:21.361,00:30:25.490,There's not a lot of guys still wrestling... into your 40s and 50s.
00:30:29.577,00:30:32.580,we are very grateful for all you have made here.
00:30:32.664,00:30:34.541,Thank you very much for everything.
00:30:39.754,00:30:43.216,"whether they wanna win or lose, when they go out to compete."
00:30:44.676,00:30:47.136,"They don't have that determination, that desire..."
00:30:47.220,00:30:50.139,the burning desire to win at all costs.
00:30:56.688,00:30:59.232,and he couldn't do it physically.
00:30:59.315,00:31:02.360,"So, he had people help him do it."
00:31:09.868,00:31:14.998,"where you have these gorillas coming out to wrestle John and then rolling on their back and, you know..."
00:31:15.081,00:31:17.417,And John's the champion and the people are cheering his name.
00:31:17.500,00:31:19.752,It was... completely absurd.
00:31:27.510,00:31:29.804,"with a bunch of cash afterward and, you know, paying the guy off."
00:31:34.934,00:31:36.603,and actually took him down.
00:31:36.686,00:31:38.688,And he thought it was real.
00:31:38.771,00:31:44.485,"Now, a lot of the guys knew that, you know, Okay, we're just... we're doing this and... John thinks it's real."
00:31:44.569,00:31:46.863,"Okay, let's let him think it's real."
00:32:03.963,00:32:08.760,"But we, you know, we wanted to make him-- He loved that stuff. He was so happy."
00:32:08.843,00:32:14.182,And everyone was just kind of pacifying the guy because he was good for the sport.
00:32:14.265,00:32:19.479,"If you go out there with that determination and that desire and that fierceness, you will win."
00:32:20.480,00:32:22.315,And your future opponents will fear you.
00:32:42.752,00:32:46.297,There are three things that always were a part of the estate.
00:32:46.381,00:32:49.008,"The du Pont family, the wrestling..."
00:32:50.259,00:32:51.636,and then the hunting side.
00:32:54.639,00:32:57.308,It was very difficult to be able to hunt on that estate.
00:32:57.392,00:33:04.065,"You had to be invited, and the people that controlled the hunting were the Newtown Square Police."
00:33:10.488,00:33:12.907,Not much. As little as possible at this point.
00:33:12.991,00:33:15.576,"To be honest with you, it's getting close to quittin' time."
00:33:15.660,00:33:17.161,-Yeah? -So...
00:33:20.915,00:33:23.376,"he'd lived on the estate, he was one of the tenants."
00:33:23.459,00:33:28.256,He had handled who would be permitted to hunt on the property.
00:33:32.218,00:33:40.351,"But I suspect that much of that was because he was, um, generous with respect to a lot of Delaware County institutions."
00:33:47.233,00:33:53.114,He had an outdoor shooting range on the property where we went to do our firearms training.
00:33:55.908,00:34:00.246,and he lent that out to surrounding townships if they needed it.
00:34:00.329,00:34:02.999,"He rode around town, you know, with officers."
00:34:03.082,00:34:04.083,He had a uniform and everything.
00:34:04.167,00:34:07.795,He was paid $1 a year just to be a reserve officer.
00:34:13.593,00:34:18.973,"and every hunting season, we would all meet up at the hunting camp and go hunting together."
00:34:19.057,00:34:22.185,Most of the hunters were police officers.
00:34:25.813,00:34:28.691,"The thing about that place, it was like our own world."
00:34:29.567,00:34:35.448,You could do so many things back there that the average person could not even consider doing.
00:34:40.912,00:34:42.789,"That's gonna fall, gonna fall."
00:34:49.003,00:34:51.964,of his town car with a rifle...
00:34:52.048,00:34:54.884,which was illegal in the area at the time.
00:35:00.348,00:35:05.853,"and his close personal relationship with the law enforcement in the county, he thought he could do what he wanted."
00:35:06.813,00:35:10.483,"He flew the, uh, Foxcatcher flag above the American flag on Foxcatcher."
00:35:10.566,00:35:12.693,He was the ultimate authority.
00:35:13.277,00:35:15.863,"He thought this was, uh, du Pont Land."
00:35:23.663,00:35:25.623,But what are the disadvantages?
00:35:25.706,00:35:33.965,"There are many disadvantages to having money, and that is, you are targeted by a great number of people who would like to take it away from you."
00:35:44.475,00:35:52.608,"and people were always after him to donate to this, to donate to that, to-- I think he'd been sued for some things that were real or not real."
00:35:54.235,00:35:57.780,So many people were there to use John.
00:35:57.864,00:36:01.534,"John had no idea who his real friends were, I don't believe."
00:36:05.746,00:36:06.956,Are these guys here 'cause they like me?
00:36:07.039,00:36:12.628,"Or are they here 'cause, you know, I'm providing this facility for them, or I'm paying them?"
00:36:12.712,00:36:16.132,"That probably played around in his mind over and over, I'm sure."
00:36:18.176,00:36:21.262,"Guy's got a lot of money, he's living on a big property."
00:36:21.345,00:36:25.224,"So, to me, it was like, All right, a little paranoia was probably appropriate."
00:36:43.117,00:36:45.453,and he would tape it for hours on end.
00:36:45.536,00:36:54.420,"And then he'd sit and watch it, this still picture of the woods, and he would try to get people to buy into things he was seeing in the woods."
00:36:58.925,00:37:00.218,And you'd say no and he'd...
00:37:00.968,00:37:03.471,"He'd get a little frustrated, you know, and then he'd fast forward."
00:37:03.554,00:37:05.389,"All right, now look at this, this is where it is."
00:37:05.473,00:37:07.391,"You know, Look, look at this. Do you see something moving?"
00:37:07.475,00:37:08.643,"Or, Do you see this?"
00:37:08.726,00:37:10.978,"Do you see a shape in there, or a form in there?"
00:37:11.062,00:37:12.897,And you'd... No.
00:37:22.490,00:37:31.290,"Or maybe it's just a power trip on his part, like, I wanna see if they'll just follow me and believe something."
00:37:31.374,00:37:44.011,"You know, when you're in that moment, situation, You can't just nod because, sometimes, he would mean it in psychosis or whatever."
00:37:44.095,00:37:45.304,"But other times, he would bait you."
00:37:45.388,00:37:48.474,"He'd look out over the field and say, You see those deer?"
00:37:48.557,00:37:49.892,They're really people dressed up as deer.
00:37:49.976,00:37:52.019,They're mechanical deer and someone's planting them there.
00:37:52.103,00:37:57.149,"And if you say, Oh, yeah, John, I see what you mean, he'll say, No, they're not! They're really deer!"
00:38:02.280,00:38:03.489,"Oh, yeah, maybe I see it."
00:38:03.572,00:38:07.576,"You know, those kind of comments would just get him to go even farther."
00:38:07.660,00:38:25.011,"I generally went somewhat along with it, to a degree, Whereas Dave Schultz, being, in my opinion, the truest friend John had, would not agree."
00:38:30.516,00:38:32.685,developed an affection for John.
00:38:32.768,00:38:34.729,"And Dave, probably more than anybody."
00:38:35.563,00:38:39.525,Dave genuinely liked John and tried to help him.
00:38:43.571,00:38:45.865,kind of watching him and making sure he was okay.
00:38:45.948,00:38:54.540,"We'd do it in shifts, you know. Like, I'd leave at, like, 9:30, and after the kids would go to sleep, Dave and Valo would come up and they'd hang out at the big house until, like, 11:00."
00:38:54.623,00:38:55.666,It was very benign.
00:38:55.750,00:38:59.503,"You'd just sit over there and watch television, or you'd go down and play pool."
00:39:00.963,00:39:09.638,"It was an on-going process where he was helping us... be wrestlers, and we were trying to help him... to be social."
00:39:09.722,00:39:13.726,"And, you know, that's kind of the way I always looked at it."
00:39:23.194,00:39:26.530,and sort of wanna be around that person most of the time.
00:39:26.614,00:39:30.242,"So, you know, when I came, I think it was probably Robbie."
00:39:30.326,00:39:34.497,"Um, Dave was that person, I think, you know, while he was there."
00:39:34.580,00:39:36.332,"And Dan, the same kind of thing with Dan."
00:39:36.415,00:39:39.126,"You know, he'd really want to have Dan around."
00:39:39.210,00:39:43.047,"Towards the end of the time I was there, it was Valentin."
00:39:44.757,00:39:46.634,Super. I'm ready.
00:39:50.846,00:39:52.390,"How you doing, Valo?"
00:39:52.473,00:39:53.974,-Good. -Good.
00:39:54.058,00:39:55.226,I'm ready for Eagle.
00:39:55.309,00:39:56.936,-Are you ready for Eagle? -Yes.
00:39:57.019,00:39:58.437,I don't know.
00:40:01.440,00:40:05.111,"and he'd be like, Okay, time to go. Valentin's coming."
00:40:05.194,00:40:10.074,"Sort of imply that You leave now and Valentin's gonna sit down, and I'm gonna hang with him."
00:40:12.201,00:40:13.202,-You ready? -Yep.
00:40:18.249,00:40:25.297,"And the more he would obsess over Valentin, the more he would obsess over this whole, uh, I'm a Bulgarian."
00:40:31.595,00:40:35.933,And he decided that he originally was Bulgarian.
00:40:36.016,00:40:38.477,He was a descendent of whomever.
00:40:43.315,00:40:46.902,You're one of the most famous French families in the world.
00:40:52.158,00:40:57.121,"No, no, this is why I identify with Valentin, because of my Bulgarian heritage."
00:41:03.294,00:41:07.339,because he wanted to be very close with Valentin Jordanov.
00:41:07.423,00:41:10.759,"And Dave and Valo were very, very good friends."
00:41:10.843,00:41:13.262,"So, I think there was a big jealousy of Dave."
00:41:39.371,00:41:40.623,I don't know if he's mad or not.
00:41:44.043,00:41:45.669,I just gotta get a little tape-work here.
00:41:45.753,00:41:49.089,We sign in Bulgarian. We sign in Bulgarian.
00:41:51.467,00:41:55.179,"I know you're fired up, man. I know I'm not-- Fuck the world! I'm gonna kill 'em all!"
00:42:06.065,00:42:10.402,"You know, where does du Pont fit with that really close friendship triangle?"
00:42:10.486,00:42:13.364,And du Pont was kind of outside the circle.
00:42:14.698,00:42:17.117,"Yeah, he said, Fuck the world. Kill 'em all, I think."
00:42:19.328,00:42:21.956,-I think that was the quote. -Okay.
00:42:30.339,00:42:33.592,And I think that sort of got to... it got to John a little bit.
00:42:41.809,00:42:46.730,"because when John would go through some of his, like, fantasies, sometimes he threw Dave in there."
00:42:53.696,00:42:55.489,and could control the weather.
00:42:57.324,00:43:07.209,"He also got convinced there were tunnels going into the mansion, going out of the mansion, and that Dave Schultz used these tunnels to mess with him."
00:43:11.463,00:43:14.300,"There's people in the walls, and, um..."
00:43:14.383,00:43:15.843,"I think it's Schultz, or something."
00:43:15.926,00:43:17.636,"You know, he'd say something crazy like that."
00:43:17.720,00:43:21.307,"And I'd say, Dave Schultz isn't in your walls, John."
00:43:27.354,00:43:28.606,"Hi, there."
00:43:28.689,00:43:30.774,"And du Pont, we trusted him up to a point."
00:43:30.858,00:43:35.195,"But, you know, the fact that he would hire a security firm to protect him..."
00:43:35.279,00:43:38.073,And he would say that he's protecting him from one of us.
00:43:49.084,00:43:53.756,that John du Pont had been involved with some... threats.
00:43:53.839,00:43:57.259,"And so, that's what prompted him to reach out to us."
00:44:04.266,00:44:11.315,"Him having these Special Force, FBI, CIA guys around him, John became super, hyper paranoid."
00:44:16.820,00:44:22.368,which he thought were built by his father as props for garden parties.
00:44:24.286,00:44:30.459,"And so whether I believe it's a fact or not, it's worth an investigation."
00:44:30.542,00:44:34.421,So we started out with these low-level investigative efforts.
00:44:34.505,00:44:37.549,Dig a hole right there in the yard. Let's see what we find.
00:44:38.759,00:44:41.095,Let's bring a metal detector in and see what we find.
00:44:41.178,00:44:48.310,"And then we got ever more sophisticated, as John kept insisting, and we brought in some technical equipment and some technical people."
00:44:52.940,00:44:54.274,We'll go in your walls and look. We'll get X-rays.
00:44:54.358,00:44:56.902,We'll knock the walls down.
00:44:57.569,00:45:00.614,"I'm like, Why don't you just tell him no one's there? You know?"
00:45:00.697,00:45:09.289,"It wasn't my job to question... what his concerns were, but to try to, uh, allay his fears."
00:45:09.373,00:45:16.046,"In other words, to factually say, This individual is not a threat for these reasons."
00:45:16.130,00:45:19.466,"Or, This doesn't exist."
00:45:36.024,00:45:38.402,It just kept getting stranger and stranger.
00:45:49.455,00:45:53.709,So he couldn't wear black shirts. He got rid of all the black horses.
00:45:53.792,00:45:56.545,"I had a black car, had to get rid of that."
00:46:03.051,00:46:05.304,that were African American off the team.
00:46:07.848,00:46:09.391,"Now, we start talking."
00:46:09.475,00:46:12.686,"I mean, what's going on with this guy? Why would he do something like this?"
00:46:15.439,00:46:20.360,"You know, You really don't want to be in this position of being perceived as racist on this."
00:46:20.861,00:46:26.283,"And he didn't buy into that and said, Well, it's not that. I just don't want black."
00:46:27.701,00:46:30.412,Kevin Jackson was at the peak of his game.
00:46:30.496,00:46:36.668,"And to have to call him up and say, Kevin, I got bad news for you, was just heartbreaking."
00:46:39.463,00:46:41.465,"Yeah, he won't let me drive my black van on the property."
00:46:41.548,00:46:43.467,He's kicked off Pritchett and Fisher.
00:46:43.550,00:46:46.053,"And then he looks at me and says, You, too."
00:46:46.136,00:46:51.225,"And for me, I'm-- It's hard for me to believe because I'm already Olympic champion, world champion."
00:46:51.308,00:46:53.685,That's the last thing I expected.
00:46:59.316,00:47:03.987,I felt that we should disassociate from du Pont at that point in time.
00:47:04.071,00:47:08.867,And I was just purely asking for someone to hold him accountable for his actions.
00:47:08.951,00:47:14.998,"You got four, five black guys getting kicked off of a team by your main sponsor."
00:47:15.082,00:47:17.251,"And nothing's done, nothing's said."
00:47:17.334,00:47:21.213,"And he's still VIP, still your main guy."
00:47:24.174,00:47:26.802,Maybe that should've been enough of a warning.
00:47:27.928,00:47:32.140,"But in any case, for whatever reason, we didn't really do anything about it at that point."
00:47:33.559,00:47:40.899,"I guess, to some degree, we were taking advantage financially of the benefits that we were getting."
00:48:08.760,00:48:12.055,Had to entertain you and Dave at the big house.
00:48:12.139,00:48:13.140,Lots of fun.
00:48:13.223,00:48:16.184,"You know, this thing is really beautiful."
00:48:16.268,00:48:19.313,"Some of the colors on it, the shine."
00:48:22.482,00:48:27.321,"About 11:00 at night, he would get himself spun up."
00:48:27.404,00:48:32.784,"And as we found out later, it was probably by virtue of chemical enhancement."
00:48:38.415,00:48:40.459,"I mean, I'd be at his house stayin', and he wouldn't sleep."
00:48:40.542,00:48:43.629,"I could hear him up walking the halls, you know, all night."
00:48:49.718,00:48:59.728,"I would, like, try and ask him about a piece of furniture, but then he would slowly get into the wood grain of the furniture and then actually seeing bugs or something or creatures."
00:49:04.483,00:49:10.864,your little slime-bug friends had added to the golden gloss that it has.
00:49:10.947,00:49:13.367,It would not have that if it had not been for them.
00:49:14.576,00:49:16.328,What's this thing?
00:49:17.496,00:49:19.164,There are all sorts of friends to go with you.
00:49:24.961,00:49:27.297,And he would scratch until they would bleed.
00:49:27.381,00:49:30.592,"And we're going, Well, he's doing something. He's doing drugs."
00:49:30.676,00:49:33.387,You know? And he's going crazy.
00:49:33.470,00:49:37.015,"Subjectively, in my observations, yeah, it got worse and worse."
00:49:37.099,00:49:42.771,"Uh, he had periods there where he's walking around in draping red clothing, saying he's the Dalai Lama."
00:49:53.448,00:49:55.617,about John carrying...
00:49:55.701,00:49:59.830,um... a handgun around the place.
00:49:59.913,00:50:07.379,"And one time, I think he had seen some things in the trees and he actually shot up into the trees."
00:50:11.466,00:50:14.344,"He would walk around carrying it under here, you know."
00:50:18.140,00:50:21.226,So I didn't like to be around him when he was carrying his gun around.
00:50:42.289,00:50:45.500,"the closer I got, the more nervous I got."
00:50:45.584,00:50:49.755,I'm getting nervous to where I'm shaking going into work.
00:50:54.509,00:50:59.890,"You know, the big house being the sun, and the closer you got to the sun, the more likely you were to get burnt."
00:50:59.973,00:51:04.478,"So, really, the athletes tried to not get too close to the sun."
00:51:08.523,00:51:10.025,that really cared about John.
00:51:14.446,00:51:17.282,Are you okay? What's going on?
00:51:21.495,00:51:27.542,"We talked to Dr. Gostigian about it, and he said there's probably just chemical imbalance here."
00:51:27.626,00:51:29.169,It could probably be fixed with medicine.
00:51:29.252,00:51:31.713,"And we went and told him that, and he got really mad."
00:51:31.797,00:51:34.466,"He said, I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me."
00:51:35.675,00:51:37.594,You guys just don't believe me.
00:51:46.728,00:51:49.439,And then he started the whole thing with Dan.
00:52:17.634,00:52:25.016,"Not even through John's own words, but through his attorney, that, John wants you to move off the estate."
00:52:25.100,00:52:27.435,"Well, that was a little bit of a bitter pill to swallow."
00:52:33.066,00:52:39.447,"Dan didn't do it right away, so John had a U-Haul brought to his house and parked it in front."
00:52:39.531,00:52:41.283,And it just sat there.
00:52:45.328,00:52:46.538,Okay.
00:52:57.883,00:53:04.389,"He walked up to me and he gets the gun and points it at my chest, he goes, Don't you...with me! I want you off this farm!"
00:53:04.472,00:53:10.520,"And I just shrunk my head, and I showed him the palms of my hands, and I just said, John, I don't know what this is all about."
00:53:10.604,00:53:13.315,I've only tried to be your friend.
00:53:13.398,00:53:20.363,"And it was just enough, he backed up, he put the gun down and then he ran back to the big house."
00:53:29.456,00:53:32.709,But... that's typical stuff.
00:53:37.047,00:53:38.173,I called the police.
00:53:38.256,00:53:40.759,"I told them John had pulled a machine gun on me, and he laughed."
00:53:40.842,00:53:45.055,"He said, Well, I've known John a long time. He's always been a little different."
00:53:45.138,00:53:47.682,Newtown Square police officer.
00:53:47.766,00:53:52.062,There was a growing number of incidents prior to this.
00:53:52.145,00:53:54.564,"Uh, minor incidents. Nothing serious."
00:53:54.648,00:53:58.485,"Arguments, fights, allegations back and forth."
00:54:15.085,00:54:16.586,There's the moving van.
00:54:17.545,00:54:18.713,John...
00:54:19.965,00:54:25.679,"or somebody, I don't know if it's John or who, burnt down this house next door."
00:54:29.724,00:54:33.770,"This place is turning to, like, a battle zone or something."
00:54:33.853,00:54:39.150,"There was a big, old fire in here with flames coming out of the windows."
00:54:40.235,00:54:42.237,Here's the inside.
00:54:42.320,00:54:43.989,Unbelievable.
00:54:45.073,00:54:47.325,Wow. This is so weird.
00:54:48.284,00:54:50.996,"Oh, shit, man. I hope this comes out."
00:54:51.079,00:54:52.372,Look at that shit.
00:54:52.455,00:54:56.376,"There's the tree through the wall, and chairs."
00:55:02.424,00:55:03.717,Wow!
00:55:05.552,00:55:10.890,"And then that was it. As soon as the smoke cleared, I called U.S.A. Wrestling immediately."
00:55:10.974,00:55:14.477,I flew out to Colorado to meet with them and plead.
00:55:14.561,00:55:16.563,Get those guys out of there.
00:55:20.358,00:55:24.112,That was the one incident where a gun was pulled...
00:55:24.195,00:55:27.115,"where we all asked ourselves, Wait a second."
00:55:27.198,00:55:30.785,Maybe this is more than just eccentric behavior.
00:55:36.624,00:55:39.544,I need you on a conference call.
00:55:39.627,00:55:42.338,We're gonna debate this issue.
00:55:43.757,00:55:48.178,So we get on this conversation and the conversation digresses quickly.
00:55:48.261,00:55:53.349,"And there were some people on the board who were adamant that, Hey, we need to cut ties."
00:55:53.433,00:55:56.061,"You know, we should probably just take steps to..."
00:55:56.144,00:55:58.063,separate ourselves from John.
00:55:58.146,00:56:00.398,"Um, obviously, we couldn't kick him out of the sport."
00:56:00.482,00:56:05.111,"He was free to do whatever he wanted to do, but we could... we could turn back his resources."
00:56:09.074,00:56:17.665,"And this was probably the deciding moment after this hour-long debate, argument, you know."
00:56:17.749,00:56:19.584,"We get down to this, and Dave says..."
00:56:20.585,00:56:23.421,I have my family and children on the farm.
00:56:23.505,00:56:29.511,"If I thought for one moment they were in danger, I would pack up and leave."
00:56:30.762,00:56:34.891,"And so we thought, Well, that's convincing."
00:56:41.189,00:56:44.484,"Come on, come over here. Come on. Hey! Ah!"
00:56:44.567,00:56:45.985,"Good job, Mom."
00:56:58.164,00:57:00.125,And there was some tension.
00:57:02.877,00:57:06.589,I just pulled the truck back up and started loading so I could get the hell out of there.
00:57:09.634,00:57:13.596,The number-one surfer Dan Chaid just fell off the wave.
00:57:25.692,00:57:28.361,I think he just was fixated on you.
00:57:28.445,00:57:30.822,"You know, tried to really keep directing it towards me."
00:57:32.407,00:57:34.659,"You gotta be... you gotta be kidding me, right?"
00:57:43.418,00:57:46.713,and left his van over at Dave's house.
00:57:46.796,00:57:49.007,And that caused all kinds of problems.
00:57:50.425,00:57:53.761,"Now, John is focusing on Dave's house, on Dave."
00:57:53.845,00:57:56.055,"Like, Why is the truck there? What's in the truck?"
00:57:56.139,00:57:58.433,"You know, who knows what went through his mind."
00:58:05.648,00:58:07.609,-Lookit. -Uh-huh...
00:58:07.692,00:58:09.819,A fine mouth.
00:58:09.903,00:58:11.529,Isn't that funny?
00:58:16.493,00:58:18.745,informed him that Chaid was on the property.
00:58:18.828,00:58:26.169,"And du Pont got high or drunk or both and went to David's home with a rifle, uh, looking for Chaid."
00:58:26.252,00:58:32.258,"He did come down to the house carrying a shotgun, was drunk and then..."
00:58:32.342,00:58:36.054,"As soon as he came in the door, Dave stopped him at the front door and said, John, you can't come in my house like this."
00:58:36.137,00:58:37.764,Especially not with a gun. Give me the gun.
00:58:37.847,00:58:39.140,And John gave him the gun.
00:58:39.224,00:58:44.395,"And John was so drunk, he fell down. He just stumbled and fell down."
00:58:44.479,00:58:47.273,He hit his head on a window sill and cut his head open.
00:58:47.357,00:58:50.235,We had to call a doctor and have him stitched up.
00:58:52.445,00:58:54.697,"Pull his car downstairs, if you could?"
00:59:08.086,00:59:09.712,What's going on?
00:59:09.796,00:59:11.923,"Looked like Raging Bull, you know?"
00:59:12.006,00:59:14.634,"Couldn't open it. Big, puffed up and..."
00:59:15.718,00:59:19.931,"He said, What's it look like? I said, It looks like you got hit with a bat."
00:59:23.685,00:59:30.650,"that he'd been assaulted by Chaid, and wanted the police to look into it and I think he even went to the state police as well as the local police."
00:59:34.737,00:59:40.159,"because they went down to question Dave, and he'd said, No, that's not true."
00:59:40.243,00:59:42.996,Dan was here for about ten minutes and left.
00:59:46.833,00:59:49.460,they just kind of sat on it for a while.
00:59:49.544,00:59:55.842,"Uh, there was no criminal activity on the part of Chaid who wasn't even there, and not on the part of David Schultz."
00:59:56.884,01:00:01.931,"But du Pont began to bear hostility towards David, feeling that he betrayed him."
01:00:02.015,01:00:06.769,And the relationship with David began to deteriorate right at that point.
01:00:11.482,01:00:13.943,There's just no reason to live in an environment like that.
01:00:15.987,01:00:17.655,"And we had a little conflict over it, even."
01:00:17.739,01:00:19.115,"I'm sorry, but I'm drawing a line in the sand."
01:00:19.198,01:00:23.911,"We're gonna leave. And then Dave started saying, Well, we'll move to California as soon as the Olympics are over."
01:00:24.787,01:00:30.001,"We were six months away from the Olympic trials, and Dave, he was, like, 37, I think."
01:00:31.377,01:00:37.383,"So for him, this is his last chance to be on an Olympic team and win another gold medal."
01:00:45.308,01:00:48.519,"because we were pursuing our dream, you know?"
01:00:52.190,01:00:55.860,"John being paranoid and us helping him, and... you know."
01:00:57.028,01:00:58.071,So...
01:01:02.075,01:01:07.664,"He loved Dave, and then Dave also became like this demon that was after him."
01:01:09.749,01:01:12.585,He'd gotten madder and madder and madder.
01:01:16.756,01:01:20.093,"I mean, Dave should've got out of there. Dave should've left."
01:01:20.176,01:01:27.183,"From tunnels, to spying on him, from everything else, he came to the determination that Dave was responsible for it."
01:01:27.266,01:01:28.893,And he was gonna do something about it.
01:01:39.195,01:01:41.447,It's been snowing straight for 24 hours.
01:01:41.531,01:01:45.118,And this is the scene at Foxcatcher Farms.
01:01:45.201,01:01:46.244,There's Dave's window.
01:01:46.327,01:01:49.163,You can't even see out of Dave's office windows.
01:01:49.247,01:01:50.289,Nobody can go anywhere.
01:01:50.373,01:01:53.334,Dave went to borrow the plow from the dairy people.
01:02:01.884,01:02:04.387,"What do you think of the snowstorm, Danny?"
01:02:15.189,01:02:21.070,"He had kids, K-I-D-S, written on his forehead."
01:02:21.154,01:02:24.449,"And I said, 'Kids'? Why'd you write 'kids' on your forehead, Dave, in marker?"
01:02:24.532,01:02:29.245,"He's like, Oh, that's to remind me. I have to pick the kids up at school."
01:02:29.328,01:02:36.586,"And I said, Dave, you don't seem like the kind of guy that's gonna be looking in the mirror a whole lot, so why would you write it there?"
01:02:36.669,01:02:40.882,"So he said, That's why I wrote it here... too."
01:02:40.965,01:02:43.217,"And he had it written in his hand, kids."
01:03:00.276,01:03:01.652,Come on in. The heat's getting out.
01:03:08.159,01:03:10.286,"He says, We've had a storm on the property."
01:03:10.369,01:03:14.373,He says there's a lot of trees down and some damage to the fences and so forth.
01:03:14.457,01:03:17.251,"He says, Let me take you around and show you."
01:03:17.335,01:03:21.130,"Then he comes out with, um, a camera and a pistol..."
01:03:22.381,01:03:23.841,which was a little unusual.
01:03:28.429,01:03:30.515,and he's showing me what trees fell and so forth.
01:03:32.892,01:03:36.604,"We go to the right, to the backside of the property where Dave's house was."
01:03:43.986,01:03:48.032,"So, Dave kind of walked over here, and he said, It's John."
01:03:48.115,01:03:50.535,So John pulled his car up right about here.
01:03:54.413,01:03:56.332,John picks the pistol up...
01:03:56.415,01:03:58.835,and immediately swings it out the window and shoots Dave.
01:04:30.783,01:04:33.077,"Oh, God, please hurry!"
01:04:38.916,01:04:40.960,"It's gonna be okay, David."
01:04:54.140,01:04:57.393,and he was doing this thing that he used to do when he was training real hard. He was going...
01:04:59.061,01:05:02.523,"Like trying to concentrate, like trying to keep himself alive."
01:05:02.607,01:05:04.734,"And all of a sudden, he just stopped breathing."
01:05:04.817,01:05:08.654,"And I said, I love you, and I gave him a kiss on the forehead..."
01:05:08.738,01:05:10.823,and... he died.
01:05:10.907,01:05:12.199,He died right then.
01:05:22.960,01:05:26.297,As I got out of the seatbelt and proceeded to get out of the car...
01:05:27.506,01:05:30.676,he threw the car in reverse and fled.
01:05:33.220,01:05:39.435,"He had gone back to the house and said, Police will be coming. Don't let them in."
01:05:46.192,01:05:50.154,and we gave them a briefing of what had occurred.
01:05:50.237,01:05:56.661,"We knew that he had a variety of weapons, a lot of handguns, rifles."
01:05:56.744,01:06:08.255,"We knew that one end of the mansion was a combination library/safe room, and that had a vault door, and we knew that that could be used to hole up in, so to speak."
01:06:08.339,01:06:10.049,I guess the news spread fast.
01:06:10.132,01:06:13.344,I think John shot somebody. They're saying it might be Dave.
01:06:13.427,01:06:19.016,"Okay, so, they were messing around and the gun might have fell and hit Dave and he's going to the hospital."
01:06:31.696,01:06:36.325,"I was just briefed at the command center. Uh, negotiations are ongoing."
01:06:36.409,01:06:39.829,Situation is status quo. They had me contact with Mr. du Pont.
01:07:09.483,01:07:11.527,in a wealthy Pennsylvania suburb.
01:07:11.610,01:07:16.198,It involves a violent murder and a heavily armed stand-off with police.
01:07:16.282,01:07:24.248,"It also involves the heir to a huge fortune, a du Pont, who has turned his estate into a massive fortress."
01:07:26.042,01:07:27.668,We found out it was...
01:07:39.180,01:07:41.599,"We went in the emergency room. I was like, Where's Dave Schultz?"
01:07:41.682,01:07:44.560,"And she's like, He's gone. I'm like, Where'd they take him?"
01:07:44.643,01:07:46.187,"And she's like, No, he's gone."
01:07:47.813,01:07:49.774,And nobody knew what-- Nobody said anything.
01:07:49.857,01:07:51.734,Just couldn't-- Just shocked.
01:07:51.817,01:07:54.487,"Didn't, couldn't-- Speechless."
01:07:58.741,01:08:03.120,they had to take me straight to the police station where I had to start giving a statement about what happened.
01:08:03.204,01:08:07.333,And all I could think about was 'cause they didn't know yet.
01:08:14.423,01:08:19.345,and brought me and my sister upstairs and all the other adults brought everyone into the basement.
01:08:23.766,01:08:37.446,"and, um, she just, like, took some breaths and she said, Today, John du Pont pulled up to the house and... shot a gun and killed your father."
01:08:39.198,01:08:42.159,"And then we just sat in the basement and cried for, uh..."
01:08:43.911,01:08:45.704,It felt like hours.
01:08:59.260,01:09:06.684,"We intend to wait as long as it takes to resolve this problem, uh, without anyone else being... without anyone else being injured."
01:09:12.314,01:09:19.363,"and then into Sunday, it was kind of unprecedented that a SWAT situation would go this long."
01:09:19.446,01:09:26.287,"Last evening, at approximately 9:00 p.m., negotiations with Mr. du Pont, uh, continued."
01:09:27.538,01:09:33.711,"The phone call with Mr. du Pont was extremely cordial and positive, and that was the last contact with Mr. du Pont."
01:09:33.794,01:09:37.715,Mr. du Pont chose to go to bed at that particular time...
01:09:37.798,01:09:42.469,"and, uh, all negotiations or contacts with Mr. du Pont ended at 9:00 last night."
01:09:46.182,01:09:48.851,I wish I had a better answer than I don't know.
01:09:53.439,01:09:56.942,led some residents to ask why local police did not take action.
01:09:57.026,01:10:01.697,They wondered if du Pont and the police had perhaps developed too chummy a relationship.
01:10:01.780,01:10:09.121,"Several, several years ago, we were all, uh, up at the range, uh, practicing on the inside and outside range."
01:10:10.456,01:10:11.457,"No, ma'am, no."
01:10:13.459,01:10:15.669,"I've never shot a gun with Mr. du Pont at all, no."
01:10:22.843,01:10:25.429,I can't disclose that. I can't comment on that right now.
01:10:32.519,01:10:36.023,"have been working under very, very difficult situations with the weather."
01:10:37.107,01:10:44.823,"Heat was, in fact, turned off to the du Pont mansion late Friday evening, so there is no heat at this time inside the mansion."
01:11:35.874,01:11:39.878,Members of the mansion must move back. You must move back.
01:11:39.962,01:11:43.757,"Then over the radios we hear, He's coming out, he's coming out."
01:11:46.719,01:11:51.640,He then exits the back door of the property and starts walking towards the greenhouse.
01:11:53.600,01:11:58.647,"An officer came out from behind a tree, started giving him commands."
01:11:58.731,01:12:02.901,"He kind of threw his hands up and then put them down and then up, and kind of turned back towards the house."
01:12:05.487,01:12:09.199,A fast officer by the name of Officer Lunn chased him down.
01:12:09.283,01:12:12.745,"It's my understanding there was a tackle involved, but, uh, that was it."
01:12:16.707,01:12:19.835,on the grounds of the du Pont estate in Delaware County has ended.
01:12:19.918,01:12:23.047,John du Pont walked out of his mansion and was apprehended by police.
01:12:23.130,01:12:27.885,"He is in jail tonight, charged with murdering wrestler Dave Schultz."
01:13:02.086,01:13:07.216,There's almost a fogginess around some of the memories that it doesn't feel like-- It's almost like an out-of-body experience.
01:13:07.299,01:13:13.680,"You almost feel like you're watching it or something, completely not knowing which end is up and life had fallen apart."
01:13:13.764,01:13:15.599,Life had literally fallen apart.
01:13:23.482,01:13:27.069,I could've seen it coming or could've did something about it.
01:13:28.362,01:13:31.657,"It's just sad that, you know, Dave had to die."
01:13:31.740,01:13:32.866,For what?
01:13:38.914,01:13:51.343,"that while this happened, everybody who knew Dave, everybody who knew what was going on, everybody who had some thought of what might be going on, we all have some part to blame, some guilt to carry."
01:13:59.017,01:14:07.484,"I'm sure he felt a responsibility, also to people like me who-- He, like, basically pledged to me that... Everything will be fine."
01:14:07.568,01:14:09.069,Du Pont will do what he says.
01:14:09.153,01:14:11.864,We're gonna... we're gonna train and make the Olympic team.
01:14:12.990,01:14:14.116,So...
01:14:23.542,01:14:27.379,He achieved everything there was to achieve in wrestling.
01:14:28.505,01:14:36.555,"And most of all, and you've heard it repeatedly, he was a great friend to his teammates... and, really, to everyone that he knew."
01:14:37.514,01:14:40.267,I felt like Dave was a best friend.
01:14:40.350,01:14:48.150,"But I also acknowledge he had about a thousand of those best friends, that anybody who developed a relationship with Dave, that's how you felt."
01:14:48.233,01:14:50.986,You felt like the most important person to Dave.
01:14:51.069,01:14:52.404,It was really a unique skill.
01:14:57.284,01:15:00.621,But the memory... will stay with me.
01:15:02.664,01:15:06.627,It was the six best years of my life.
01:15:14.301,01:15:20.057,"have so many great stories about him and came to know him and who he was, I don't."
01:15:28.982,01:15:37.324,"why John committed this senseless and brutal killing of my husband, I am confident that the police and the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation and bring him to justice."
01:15:45.082,01:15:49.336,"I mean, there was never a doubt that John du Pont killed Dave Schultz."
01:15:49.419,01:15:50.963,That really wasn't the issue.
01:15:51.046,01:15:53.507,"Uh, the issue was obviously gonna be a mental health issue."
01:15:58.804,01:16:02.474,"If accepted by a jury, results in an acquittal."
01:16:03.141,01:16:05.102,He can walk out the door.
01:16:08.814,01:16:12.985,"to demonstrate that the defendant is, uh, not insane."
01:16:13.068,01:16:23.453,"And with someone like du Pont, that was a real problem because this is a person whose behavior would cause an average person they heard about him say, That guy is crazy. He's insane."
01:16:31.086,01:16:35.048,"and there were camps. I mean, there was definitely two camps."
01:16:35.132,01:16:40.971,You were either on the side of Dave Schultz or you were on the side of John du Pont.
01:16:46.101,01:16:55.444,"uh, much of that support has either, uh, dissipated or evaporated or just simply left him."
01:17:00.616,01:17:03.994,and wants us to come in and meet with him in his office.
01:17:07.414,01:17:14.963,"We wanna start Foxcatcher up again in respect to Dave and Nancy, and, you know, we'll double your salary."
01:17:15.922,01:17:20.135,I just... I wanted to walk out right then. I couldn't even look at the guy.
01:17:20.218,01:17:23.096,"You know, I just... Does he think we're that stupid?"
01:17:32.272,01:17:34.066,him supported...
01:17:35.192,01:17:36.735,by us any...
01:17:37.653,01:17:39.363,It was... it was hard because...
01:17:40.614,01:17:42.074,"you know, you got the wrestlers..."
01:17:43.825,01:17:47.704,"That was like a family there, and it's gone."
01:17:47.788,01:17:49.039,Um...
01:17:52.751,01:17:55.212,I had a house there I couldn't really leave.
01:17:55.879,01:17:58.006,"Yeah, I just..."
01:18:00.384,01:18:04.096,I could've stayed. A lot of people did stay.
01:18:41.007,01:18:42.592,"Ah, Arina."
01:18:46.430,01:18:48.223,They lived with us.
01:18:55.188,01:18:57.023,we just went our separate ways.
01:18:57.107,01:18:58.942,"Valo, he didn't support us."
01:18:59.025,01:19:02.654,"You know, he wasn't there... for us after that."
01:19:08.702,01:19:11.913,"I wanna help du Pont get free, or anything like that."
01:19:11.997,01:19:20.005,"But I understood that if the right motivating factors are there, people can be temporary in your life."
01:19:20.088,01:19:23.550,"No matter how big they are for a moment, they can be temporary."
01:19:26.344,01:19:31.600,Opening statements are to begin today in the murder trial of multi-millionaire John du Pont.
01:19:41.151,01:19:44.237,there was that much financial support.
01:19:44.321,01:19:47.449,We were able to do focus groups. We did two of them.
01:19:47.532,01:19:51.703,"We had some of the best psychiatrists, probably, in the world."
01:19:55.290,01:19:59.836,the defense strategy appeared to be very strong.
01:20:02.631,01:20:08.762,"On the day of the murder, John du Pont was clean shaven, his hair was short, he was dressed appropriately."
01:20:08.845,01:20:24.903,"And from that day forward, he grew a long beard, he grew his hair long, and you've got the jury seeing him being wheeled in and out of court looking more and more disheveled and crazy with each passing month."
01:20:25.821,01:20:28.448,"So we were very, very concerned."
01:20:30.951,01:20:33.995,"Three, two and... one."
01:20:34.079,01:20:44.714,"If the jury of six men and six women finds du Pont not guilty by reason of insanity, he would be held in a mental hospital until doctors decided he was no longer a danger to society."
01:20:44.798,01:20:46.633,Then he could go free.
01:20:55.600,01:21:00.522,"Any time you try a case, you're hoping that the jury is gonna come back relatively quickly."
01:21:02.148,01:21:06.278,But they kept asking questions and kept deliberating.
01:21:08.363,01:21:12.701,I was scared that he was gonna get out and come kill us.
01:21:12.784,01:21:16.872,"Hello, and now my eye."
01:21:20.625,01:21:25.505,"So, you think you can escape my clutches?"
01:21:27.799,01:21:30.343,I'm coming to get you.
01:21:30.427,01:21:33.179,"Almost there, children."
01:21:45.233,01:21:48.945,that at some point he will go home again.
01:22:03.835,01:22:08.006,Tuesday night and the big story in Action News tonight is the fate of John du Pont.
01:22:11.259,01:22:12.928,"The answer, Yes."
01:22:13.011,01:22:16.056,Do you find him guilty in the third degree? Yes.
01:22:17.015,01:22:22.062,"John du Pont is going away for a long time, guilty of murder."
01:22:22.145,01:22:25.857,I think people thought that he might use money to triumph over justice.
01:22:27.025,01:22:28.902,"Well, that did not occur."
01:22:30.987,01:22:33.949,laid her head on her father's shoulder when the verdict was read.
01:22:34.032,01:22:37.160,It is the end of a yearlong struggle for justice.
01:22:38.703,01:22:44.125,"It is comforting to know that du Pont is not above the law, and he must now be held responsible for David's murder."
01:22:44.209,01:22:46.127,I'm relieved that the criminal trial is over.
01:22:46.628,01:22:50.632,I look forward to returning to California and focusing my attention on my family.
01:23:14.406,01:23:19.077,John du Pont had a bunch of the pieces of property painted black here on the estate.
01:23:19.160,01:23:20.370,The houses were painted black.
01:23:23.581,01:23:30.630,"And basically, it was just 'cause he was depressed and everything, so he just painted the estate to look like he was suffering in the prison."
01:23:56.614,01:24:02.120,"and in the newspaper it said, John du Pont dies in jail at whatever age he was at."
01:24:03.455,01:24:05.457,"And I was like, Can I see that?"
01:24:08.418,01:24:09.794,I was relieved.
01:24:10.879,01:24:14.132,"I mean, I didn't wanna worry about it anymore."
01:24:14.215,01:24:17.719,I didn't want him to sit in a jail for the rest of his life.
01:24:19.471,01:24:24.392,But I was so sad because everyone was so happy that he died.
01:24:25.769,01:24:28.605,And I just thought it was so unfair.
01:24:28.688,01:24:32.358,"I mean, when my dad died, everyone mourned."
01:24:32.442,01:24:36.321,And this guy never had anybody to love him.
01:24:37.572,01:24:40.325,And then he died and everyone's happy?
01:24:42.368,01:24:43.620,It's just sad.
01:26:01.072,01:26:02.740,She just woke up!
01:26:03.658,01:26:05.493,"Says, Let me out of here, Mom."
01:26:06.744,01:26:10.540,"And then this was our room over here, and it's really fallen apart."
01:26:13.293,01:26:14.752,These are boxes from when we first moved in.
01:26:14.836,01:26:16.921,"Look, there's Alexander's bedroom."
01:26:36.608,01:26:39.402,What are you thinking here on your first day at school?
01:26:41.613,01:26:43.656,Anything else? Can you expand on that?
01:26:54.959,01:26:56.002,"-Mommy! -Hi, Mom."
01:26:56.085,01:26:58.588,"Now, do you think that this is a pig or dog?"
01:27:02.508,01:27:04.177,What is Nicky? A pig or a dog?
01:27:10.266,01:27:12.143,-Is this a pig or a dog? -Dog.
01:27:12.227,01:27:14.020,-Dog? -Dog.
01:27:14.103,01:27:15.688,"Dog, Mommy."
