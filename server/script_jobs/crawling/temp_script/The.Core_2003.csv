00:01:13.574,00:01:14.700,It stopped.
00:01:15.492,00:01:16.744,"What's that, Dave?"
00:01:16.785,00:01:18.579,Nothing.
00:01:18.620,00:01:20.039,"Oh, we're ready."
00:01:20.080,00:01:21.498,"You, uh, feeling the magic?"
00:01:21.540,00:01:22.708,"Oh, I'm feeling the magic, all right."
00:01:23.250,00:01:24.585,Let's hit 'em.
00:01:24.626,00:01:26.294,Yeah.
00:01:26.336,00:01:29.048,Here we go.
00:01:29.088,00:01:30.716,Let's go make $30 million.
00:01:35.888,00:01:36.847,Good morning.
00:01:38.599,00:01:41.018,"Before I begin, let me..."
00:01:50.193,00:01:51.070,I'll go get help.
00:01:53.154,00:01:54.740,"Jesus. Jesus, David."
00:01:54.782,00:01:56.784,Phone 9-1-1. Phone 9-1-1!
00:02:06.085,00:02:07.252,MAN: Nick?
00:02:07.294,00:02:08.587,Vicky?!
00:02:08.629,00:02:10.255,Vicky!
00:02:35.489,00:02:36.657,"MAN 2: Okay, it's okay."
00:02:36.698,00:02:38.158,It's okay.
00:02:38.199,00:02:39.200,Everybody else off the bus.
00:02:46.249,00:02:47.960,MAN 3: Sound waves.
00:02:50.378,00:03:02.474,"So, if we know that sound waves gain wavelength and lose frequency as they travel through more dense materials..."
00:03:04.768,00:03:13.318,...Then the anomalies in these waves are the means by which we can surmise the fundamental architecture of our planet.
00:03:16.864,00:03:18.406,"How are the nails coming, Christine?"
00:03:20.283,00:03:22.077,Good.
00:03:22.119,00:03:23.286,"All right, let's have a demonstration."
00:03:24.705,00:03:27.666,"Mr. Acker, Veronica."
00:03:30.418,00:03:31.837,All right.
00:03:31.879,00:03:38.677,"Mrs. Limestone, being a big softie, you know, loves walks in the park, bedtime stories, big romantic. Loves chess."
00:03:38.719,00:03:40.679,"I can't play chess, but I'll see what I can do."
00:03:40.721,00:03:42.514,"Watch the oscilloscope, all right?"
00:03:43.390,00:03:44.516,Here we go.
00:03:53.233,00:03:54.442,Dr. Joshua Keyes?
00:03:54.484,00:03:55.527,Maybe.
00:03:56.195,00:03:57.362,"Yes or no, sir?"
00:03:58.072,00:03:59.990,The first one.
00:04:00.032,00:04:00.991,"Please come with us, sir."
00:04:04.912,00:04:06.705,"Guys, wh-what's going on?"
00:04:06.747,00:04:07.956,"We don't know, sir."
00:04:08.999,00:04:10.792,"What do you mean, you don't know?"
00:04:10.834,00:04:12.669,Your security clearance is higher than ours.
00:04:13.754,00:04:15.923,I have security clearance?
00:04:15.964,00:04:17.049,We're just here to bring you to your jet.
00:04:18.299,00:04:19.300,I have a jet?
00:04:36.985,00:04:38.486,"Hey, Serge."
00:04:38.528,00:04:39.654,Serge.
00:04:40.197,00:04:42.532,Serge.
00:04:42.574,00:04:43.951,It's about time.
00:04:46.327,00:04:47.495,"AGENT: Let's keep moving, gentlemen."
00:04:47.537,00:04:49.497,What am I doing here?
00:04:49.539,00:04:51.666,They wouldn't brief me until you got here.
00:04:51.708,00:04:55.629,"You know...there are biochemists everywhere, military. I hate them."
00:04:55.670,00:04:58.298,When are you going to meet a nice girl and bring her for dinner?
00:04:58.339,00:05:00.801,I'm married to my work.
00:05:00.842,00:05:03.178,Which makes my wife my mistress...
00:05:03.220,00:05:04.429,That's why I'm still in love with her.
00:05:06.514,00:05:07.766,JOSH: You were always a romantic.
00:05:07.808,00:05:09.143,I love my wife.
00:05:09.184,00:05:11.311,"Yeah, I know."
00:05:11.352,00:05:13.272,But I don't love your wife.
00:05:13.354,00:05:15.107,"You don't love her the same way, you know."
00:05:15.149,00:05:17.151,It's the French.
00:05:17.192,00:05:19.069,"Ah, the cheese."
00:05:19.111,00:05:20.528,You're...
00:05:20.570,00:05:22.656,"Oh, my...!"
00:05:22.697,00:05:24.741,"Whoa. Wait, these are bodies."
00:05:24.783,00:05:25.993,I think we're in the wrong place here.
00:05:26.034,00:05:28.245,"Yeah, we're in the wrong place."
00:05:28.287,00:05:31.832,"MAN 4: No. If you were in the wrong place, you would've already been shot."
00:05:31.873,00:05:32.833,That's a hell of a greeting.
00:05:34.042,00:05:35.794,Serge.
00:05:35.836,00:05:37.171,Serge.
00:05:37.212,00:05:38.379,Always a pleasure.
00:05:38.421,00:05:40.090,"Same here, Thomas."
00:05:40.132,00:05:41.340,I know.
00:05:43.844,00:05:46.638,"Gentlemen, you do realize that everything here is totally classified, okay?"
00:05:51.143,00:05:53.394,At 10:30 A.M.
00:05:51.143,00:05:55.689,"local time, 32 civilians, all within a 10-block radius..."
00:05:56.606,00:05:57.565,Died.
00:05:58.650,00:06:00.277,They didn't get sick first.
00:06:00.319,00:06:01.653,They simply hit the ground dead.
00:06:02.779,00:06:05.073,Nerve agent?
00:06:05.115,00:06:06.365,They all died at the same time?
00:06:06.407,00:06:08.576,"As far as we can tell, to the second."
00:06:08.618,00:06:10.329,This hits CNN in one hour.
00:06:10.369,00:06:11.788,I need a reason.
00:06:11.830,00:06:13.874,"Is there a variation in sex, age, body type?"
00:06:13.915,00:06:15.083,They all had pacemakers.
00:06:16.501,00:06:19.171,Under a minute.
00:06:22.132,00:06:23.967,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:06:24.009,00:06:24.968,Without any clues from the victims?
00:06:25.010,00:06:26.303,"No, that's..."
00:06:26.345,00:06:28.305,Serge and I are the clues.
00:06:28.347,00:06:31.474,"I mean, he specializes in high energy weapons."
00:06:31.516,00:06:35.312,So calling us means you suspect an electromagnetic pulse weapon.
00:06:35.354,00:06:37.356,"If these are the only fatalities, they must be people susceptible to..."
00:06:38.732,00:06:39.816,Electronic interference.
00:06:39.858,00:06:41.818,QED pacemakers.
00:06:41.860,00:06:43.111,"You're spooky sometimes, eh?"
00:06:43.153,00:06:47.199,"Now I need to know, did some sort of weapon kill these people?"
00:06:47.241,00:06:49.534,The power that you would need to create an EM pulse strong enough...
00:06:49.576,00:06:50.994,"I mean, that's..."
00:06:51.036,00:06:51.870,That's not a weapon that I've ever heard of.
00:06:52.829,00:06:53.788,"Okay, we're done."
00:06:56.375,00:06:59.418,"We're not done, sir."
00:06:59.460,00:07:01.296,I agree with Joshua...
00:07:01.338,00:07:06.343,"Our greatest concern was this may have been an act of war, I think we can all breathe a little easier, can't we?"
00:07:33.870,00:07:34.788,"What is it, sweetheart?"
00:07:43.922,00:07:45.966,"It's okay, son."
00:07:56.517,00:07:57.311,"Let's, go, let's go!"
00:08:14.244,00:08:15.120,Justin!
00:08:18.915,00:08:19.624,"Watch out, you bloody idiot!"
00:08:25.922,00:08:26.798,Hurry! Run!
00:09:09.090,00:09:10.384,Daddy!
00:09:23.480,00:09:28.026,"REPORTER: The skies are empty over Nelson's Column now, but a few hours ago, it was a different story."
00:09:28.068,00:09:32.239,Eyewitnesses claimed that the frenzied swarms of birds were not in fact attacking people deliberately...
00:09:32.280,00:09:34.324,And it's not just this time.
00:09:34.366,00:09:35.742,"No, no, no, no, no, no."
00:09:35.783,00:09:40.455,The Fortean Times reported violent bird swarms twice last month in Australia and Japan.
00:09:40.497,00:09:45.043,Five people are confirmed dead and dozens injured in the panic that followed the bizarre and terrifying incident in London's historic Trafalgar Square.
00:09:45.085,00:09:46.378,Weird.
00:09:46.420,00:09:47.628,"Quite strange, also."
00:09:47.670,00:09:49.381,"Mm. Strange, indeed."
00:09:53.343,00:09:55.970,How do birds navigate?
00:09:56.012,00:09:57.764,DANNI: By sight?
00:09:58.765,00:10:00.850,Magnetic fields.
00:10:00.892,00:10:03.562,Little ions in their brains align with the magnetic field of the earth.
00:10:07.023,00:10:08.775,Acker.
00:10:08.816,00:10:11.861,"Hit the net, do a search for..."
00:10:11.903,00:10:13.780,"Any and all like weird news, you know..."

00:10:22.456,00:10:24.207,That is a huge search.
00:10:24.249,00:10:28.086,You can use our T-1 line to look up Sailor Moon crap.
00:10:28.128,00:10:34.426,"Danni, Danni, get me the brightest kids from the field theory class and design a computer model of an electromagnetic field."
00:10:34.468,00:10:36.136,I need a 3-D computer model of the earth to lay the field over.
00:10:36.177,00:10:37.887,"Whoa-ho-ho, the planet Earth?"
00:10:37.929,00:10:38.930,"Yeah, the planet Earth."
00:10:41.224,00:10:43.393,Map out the anomalies that Acker finds and grunt out the equations.
00:10:43.435,00:10:44.269,"And, uh..."
00:10:46.062,00:10:48.106,"Grab those smelly kids from the non-linear diff class, too."
00:10:48.148,00:10:49.732,"Listen, Josh, do we even have time for this?"
00:10:49.774,00:10:52.193,Do this and I'll sign your doctorates blindfolded.
00:10:52.235,00:10:53.570,DANNI: Blindfolded?
00:10:53.612,00:10:55.363,Do not pass go.
00:11:01.244,00:11:04.789,Be wrong. Be wrong.
00:12:01.054,00:12:02.389,"MAN: Tim, I'm coming in a little hot."
00:12:02.430,00:12:03.557,"Give me some drag, will you?"
00:12:03.598,00:12:04.974,Roger that.
00:12:14.526,00:12:17.237,We are in attitude and ready for an entry interface.
00:12:17.278,00:12:19.113,"Nice work, Major."
00:12:19.155,00:12:21.408,I have the controls now for E.I.
00:12:21.449,00:12:23.742,I could take us in.
00:12:23.784,00:12:25.662,You could...
00:12:25.704,00:12:27.330,But you won't.
00:12:27.372,00:12:28.873,"Oh, no, you're not, Beck."
00:12:31.125,00:12:34.087,"You're trained, and you're certified--doesn't make you the commander."
00:12:34.128,00:12:36.005,And the commander lands the bird.
00:12:36.047,00:12:37.424,You got to be the youngest person ever in space.
00:12:37.465,00:12:38.633,"You should say, thank you, be happy."
00:12:38.675,00:12:39.551,Now.
00:12:41.595,00:12:45.682,"Endeavour, Houston, at this time we show you go for re-entry."

00:12:54.566,00:12:56.526,"That's a negative, Stick."
00:12:56.568,00:12:58.528,Is that even possible?
00:12:58.570,00:13:00.154,"MAN: Endeavour, we see you in good entry config."

00:13:06.077,00:13:07.454,Advise.
00:13:07.495,00:13:09.623,I'm seeing those plasma trails now.
00:13:09.664,00:13:11.332,"All right, mark 24h."
00:13:11.374,00:13:13.000,"So, a minute to air."

00:13:18.923,00:13:21.092,Just get me through the earth's atmosphere in this spaceship.
00:13:23.511,00:13:24.929,Com dropout.
00:13:35.565,00:13:36.650,Start the I com.
00:13:37.776,00:13:38.693,Let's wait till the...
00:13:39.694,00:13:40.612,Com restored.

00:13:57.878,00:13:59.506,We are out of position here.
00:13:59.547,00:14:01.382,Guidance shows us on energy and on course.

00:14:19.900,00:14:21.736,We got maybe two minutes of glide time left.
00:14:21.778,00:14:24.030,"The guidance, the beacons are all wrong?"

00:14:34.332,00:14:36.459,Because I have an idea.
00:14:36.501,00:14:38.169,"Houston, those buildings are getting mighty big."
00:14:39.337,00:14:40.963,"Okay, thank you."
00:14:41.005,00:14:42.006,Come on. Come on.
00:14:44.551,00:14:46.219,"It's rush hour, Commander, and it's bumper-to-bumper."

00:14:52.058,00:14:53.017,It's Houston's call. Houston?
00:14:55.895,00:14:57.188,Computers are still plotting.
00:14:57.230,00:14:58.272,Come on.
00:15:18.835,00:15:20.670,"Houston, we are running out of time here."
00:15:20.712,00:15:23.172,"Sir, I have an alternate."

00:15:26.175,00:15:28.010,"Endeavour, give them to me."

00:15:33.474,00:15:34.934,STICKLEY: Bill?
00:15:34.975,00:15:36.686,It's theoretically possible.
00:15:36.728,00:15:38.855,"Endeavour, that is confirmed."
00:15:38.897,00:15:41.649,"Turn right, heading 1-7-5."
00:15:41.691,00:15:44.527,Expect visual contact with Los Angeles River in five seconds.
00:15:50.825,00:15:53.578,"No, that will not work, Houston. We got bridges every few hundred yards."
00:15:53.620,00:15:55.496,Our wingspan alone is going to fold us up.
00:15:55.538,00:15:57.206,I've figured the L over D max.
00:15:57.248,00:15:58.583,We can make it if you can bring us straight in.
00:15:58.625,00:15:59.417,We're coming in high and hot.
00:16:06.299,00:16:07.926,"290 feet, 320."
00:16:07.967,00:16:09.260,"270, 3-0-5..."
00:16:09.302,00:16:10.470,You're on.
00:16:11.638,00:16:12.346,Gear in transition.
00:16:17.977,00:16:19.562,"240 feet, 290."
00:16:20.814,00:16:21.815,Hang on.
00:16:25.359,00:16:26.861,"210 feet, 265."
00:16:28.947,00:16:30.490,Get out of the way! Move!
00:16:34.368,00:16:35.286,Derotate.
00:16:41.459,00:16:42.710,BECK: 230... 210...
00:16:42.752,00:16:43.544,Speed brakes!
00:16:44.879,00:16:46.547,100%.
00:16:46.589,00:16:48.007,"COMMANDER: Oh, we're way too fast."
00:16:48.048,00:16:49.175,No. We'd snag the bridge.
00:16:52.971,00:16:54.430,Banking right.
00:17:00.311,00:17:02.104,"BECK: Commander, that next bridge!"
00:17:02.146,00:17:03.105,Watch it!
00:17:04.357,00:17:05.733,Suck up the gear!
00:17:05.775,00:17:06.860,We'll lose all steering.
00:17:11.906,00:17:13.658,And... Gear up now!
00:17:20.373,00:17:21.582,Lock your harnesses.
00:17:38.641,00:17:39.767,Let's get out of here!
00:17:39.809,00:17:41.352,Run! Let's get out!
00:18:27.648,00:18:28.900,"ZIMSKY: Will you make sure my assistant has your number, darling?"
00:18:28.942,00:18:30.109,Sure.
00:18:30.150,00:18:31.611,Dr. Zimsky!
00:18:31.652,00:18:32.862,I'll call security.
00:18:32.904,00:18:34.781,Hello.
00:18:34.822,00:18:36.074,Dr. Zimsky.
00:18:36.115,00:18:38.158,Josh Keyes.
00:18:38.200,00:18:39.869,"No, sir, I don't need you to sign it."
00:18:40.995,00:18:43.081,"I'm sorry, I don't have time."
00:18:43.122,00:18:45.041,I'm late for the White House.
00:18:45.083,00:18:47.126,"I need you to confirm my results, sir."
00:18:47.167,00:18:49.003,"Young man, do you have any idea who I am?"
00:18:49.045,00:18:50.463,"Yes, I do, sir."
00:18:53.800,00:18:55.134,What's it about?
00:18:56.094,00:18:57.219,It's the end of the world.
00:19:24.204,00:19:26.958,"No, I... This is impossible."
00:19:27.000,00:19:30.962,I-I-I can't have missed this.
00:19:31.004,00:19:35.008,"I mean, look, I'm sure with careful comparison to my own work, we'll find that you are mistaken."
00:19:35.049,00:19:36.592,"No offense, but..."
00:19:36.634,00:19:37.802,"Well, I mean, we'll know soon enough."
00:19:39.679,00:19:41.472,The bigger effects will start up any day now.
00:20:42.324,00:20:44.493,Rebecca?
00:20:44.535,00:20:46.037,Only you and Dad ever call me that.
00:20:46.079,00:20:48.164,"Well, Beck."
00:20:48.206,00:20:49.832,"So, what brings you to sunny D.C.?"
00:20:51.042,00:20:52.919,The board of review is next week.
00:20:55.088,00:20:58.841,Just trying to get a sense of the mood upstairs.
00:20:58.883,00:21:01.552,Your crew crashed the space shuttle.
00:21:01.594,00:21:03.679,"Now, how good do you think it could be?"
00:21:04.555,00:21:07.141,"Sir, this is my life."
00:21:07.183,00:21:09.518,I was studying for the academy when I was 13.
00:21:09.560,00:21:11.395,It still is and has always been my life.
00:21:11.437,00:21:12.563,It's over.
00:21:14.523,00:21:15.816,"It's over, Rebecca."
00:21:16.901,00:21:17.818,I'm sorry.
00:21:20.320,00:21:22.240,WOMAN: It's right down here.
00:21:22.281,00:21:23.323,It's like the 4th of July.
00:21:27.245,00:21:28.955,"Rebecca, would you excuse me, please?"
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.123,Excuse me.
00:21:34.543,00:21:37.922,Purcell.
00:21:40.967,00:21:43.302,It seems that destiny may have caught up with us.
00:22:03.572,00:22:06.284,Did Zimsky really try to give you his autograph?
00:22:09.620,00:22:11.580,"Ah, Monsieur Zimsky."
00:22:11.622,00:22:12.832,Conrad Zimsky.
00:22:12.873,00:22:14.541,Herr Zimsky.
00:22:14.583,00:22:16.376,Superstar.
00:22:18.587,00:22:19.797,Oh...
00:22:22.633,00:22:24.051,I think I skipped drunk.
00:22:24.927,00:22:27.221,Went right to hangover.
00:22:31.058,00:22:33.393,I spoke with the kids.
00:22:33.435,00:22:35.980,They don't sleep at night.
00:22:36.022,00:22:39.525,"They look at the sky, and..."
00:22:42.069,00:22:45.281,Is there any chance you're wrong?
00:22:45.323,00:22:46.782,"The sky-- I mean, that's just the beginning."
00:22:46.824,00:22:48.326,That's high-altitude static discharge.
00:22:49.160,00:22:50.703,I know.
00:22:50.744,00:22:52.412,MAN: Dr. Keyes...
00:22:55.124,00:22:57.168,...Your presence is required at the Pentagon.
00:22:57.210,00:22:59.670,Ah... It's my best buddies.
00:23:01.339,00:23:03.465,Why don't you join us for a drink?
00:23:03.507,00:23:05.759,"We'd be grateful if you could join us for a ride, sir."
00:23:05.801,00:23:07.594,And if I were to say no?
00:23:07.636,00:23:09.138,Just asking.
00:23:09.180,00:23:10.723,"Well, we have no sense of humor."
00:23:12.016,00:23:13.267,That's true.
00:23:13.309,00:23:14.352,Oh...
00:23:14.935,00:23:16.354,And we're armed.
00:23:20.358,00:23:21.650,Thank you.
00:23:24.653,00:23:25.654,"PURCELL: Dr. Keyes, welcome."
00:23:25.696,00:23:27.365,Thank you.
00:23:27.405,00:23:34.872,"Dr. Zimsky informs us that you made a useful contribution to his investigations, so he wanted you to assist him in the briefing."
00:23:34.914,00:23:36.623,"That's very generous of you, Dr. Zimsky."
00:23:36.665,00:23:38.584,"Science is a selfless business, dear boy."
00:23:39.710,00:23:43.714,"Now, why don't you begin, and I'll fill in all the difficult bits."
00:23:47.467,00:23:49.511,"All right, I'll put this as simply as I can."
00:23:52.348,00:23:53.557,Everybody on earth is dead in a year.
00:23:55.809,00:23:57.435,And let me explain why.
00:23:57.477,00:24:03.067,Wrapped around the earth is an invisible field of energy.
00:24:03.109,00:24:07.780,"Electricity and magnetism, so it's called-- creatively enough-- the electromagnetic field."
00:24:07.821,00:24:12.868,"It's where we get our magnetic north pole and south pole, and it protects us from cosmic radiation."
00:24:12.910,00:24:16.122,So this EM field is our friend.
00:24:16.163,00:24:17.998,But now...?
00:24:16.163,00:24:19.375,"ZIMSKY: But now, that field is falling apart."
00:24:20.042,00:24:20.960,Why?
00:24:21.835,00:24:22.878,Why?
00:24:28.259,00:24:30.677,Does somebody have a can of air freshener?
00:24:34.932,00:24:35.849,Quick and dirty.
00:24:38.144,00:24:40.313,"The thin skin, that's the earth's crust."
00:24:40.354,00:24:41.855,That's what we live on.
00:24:41.897,00:24:44.024,It's 30 miles thick.
00:24:44.066,00:24:47.027,"The meat here, call it the mantle."
00:24:47.069,00:24:50.990,"And forgetting all the- the funky transitions, it's 2,000 miles thick."
00:24:53.200,00:24:54.827,"The core, the peach pit in the center..."
00:24:56.162,00:24:58.122,That's a tricky one.
00:24:56.162,00:24:59.957,There's two parts-- the inner core and the outer core.
00:25:01.000,00:25:02.668,"The inner core is, uh..."
00:25:04.295,00:25:07.798,"Well, it's a big solid chunk of iron, we think."
00:25:07.840,00:25:10.968,"And that's surrounded by the outer core, and that is liquid."
00:25:11.010,00:25:16.640,"Yes, but most importantly, this liquid is constantly spinning in one direction."
00:25:16.682,00:25:22.688,"So a trillion trillion tons of hot metal spinning at a thousand miles an hour, so..."
00:25:22.729,00:25:27.067,"Right, so, physics 101-- hot metal moving fast makes an electromagnetic field."
00:25:27.109,00:25:30.446,This spinning liquid outer core is the engine that drives the EM field.
00:25:32.323,00:25:33.615,And that's where we have our problem.
00:25:33.657,00:25:35.117,This engine has stalled.
00:25:36.410,00:25:39.288,The core of the earth has stopped spinning.
00:25:40.956,00:25:42.124,How could this have happened?
00:25:44.877,00:25:46.379,We don't know.
00:25:50.007,00:25:52.134,What's the timeline here?
00:25:52.176,00:25:56.389,"As the EM field becomes more and more unstable, we'll start seeing isolated incidents."
00:25:56.430,00:25:58.807,"One plane will fall from the sky, and then two, and then..."
00:25:58.849,00:26:00.267,"In a few months, anything..."
00:26:00.309,00:26:02.019,Everything electronic will be fried.
00:26:02.061,00:26:07.107,Static discharges in the atmosphere will create super-storms with hundreds of lightning strikes per square mile.
00:26:08.108,00:26:09.109,"After that, it gets bad."
00:26:12.029,00:26:20.371,"The earth's EM field shields us from the solar winds, which are a lethal blend of radioactive particles and microwaves."
00:26:20.413,00:26:26.710,"When that shield collapses, microwave radiation will literally cook our planet."
00:26:28.379,00:26:29.255,Dr. Zimsky.
00:26:31.798,00:26:32.799,This is the sun.
00:26:34.468,00:26:36.887,This is the earth...
00:26:38.805,00:26:39.890,Would you?
00:26:50.650,00:26:53.653,"Three months, gentlemen, and we're back in the stone age."
00:26:53.695,00:26:56.031,"A full year, the field collapses..."
00:26:56.740,00:26:57.699,And that.
00:27:03.080,00:27:04.039,May I?
00:27:06.083,00:27:08.001,Feel free to throw up.
00:27:09.795,00:27:12.798,"So, how do we fix it?"
00:27:12.839,00:27:15.342,We can't.
00:27:15.384,00:27:19.263,"Then you might want to get one of those word-a-day calendars, General, because it's impossible."
00:27:19.305,00:27:22.015,The core is the size of Mars.
00:27:22.057,00:27:28.439,"This is a superheated hyper-fluid of molten iron and nickel at 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit, 2,000 miles down, 1,000 miles thick."
00:27:30.149,00:27:31.066,And the deepest we've ever been is...
00:27:32.318,00:27:34.945,Seven miles with a two-inch drill bit.
00:27:34.987,00:27:36.696,"If we can go into space, we certainly..."
00:27:36.738,00:27:39.199,"Well, space is easy."
00:27:39.241,00:27:41.160,We're talking about millions of pounds of pressure per square inch.
00:27:42.786,00:27:47.291,"Even if we somehow came up with a brilliant plan to fix the core, we just can't get there."
00:27:48.875,00:27:50.002,"ZIMSKY: Yes, but..."
00:27:56.008,00:27:57.009,...What if we could?
00:28:49.144,00:28:50.521,"Hello, Braz."
00:28:53.982,00:28:55.192,Why the hell aren't you dead yet?
00:28:57.110,00:28:58.362,"Okay, this way."
00:29:01.407,00:29:04.284,"Well, that went better than I expected."
00:29:04.326,00:29:06.036,"PURCELL: Dr. Brazzleton, I see you know Dr. Zimsky."
00:29:07.371,00:29:08.997,"20 years ago, he stole my research."
00:29:10.165,00:29:12.834,"After that, we-we kind of lost touch."
00:29:12.876,00:29:14.794,Research that was equally mine.
00:29:14.836,00:29:17.256,"That's funny, I don't remember a check from any of the patents."
00:29:17.297,00:29:20.884,20 years in the desert makes you a prophet and a martyr.
00:29:22.928,00:29:25.431,"Look, we're here about your legendary ship."
00:29:25.472,00:29:32.354,"BRAZZLETON: Okay, I'm combining high-frequency pulse lasers with resonance tube ultrasonics."
00:29:32.396,00:29:37.859,"If you've ever seen ultrasonic waves break up a kidney stone on the Discovery Channel, it's the same deal here."
00:29:37.901,00:29:39.403,"You can, uh, put your helmets on now."
00:29:41.697,00:29:42.822,Firing.
00:30:00.799,00:30:02.760,Woo...oo!
00:30:05.971,00:30:09.224,Woo-hoo!
00:30:15.481,00:30:17.566,Yeah. Oh.
00:30:31.538,00:30:34.667,"Okay, I'm officially impressed."
00:30:41.799,00:30:43.925,"ZIMSKY: So, all right."
00:30:43.967,00:30:46.470,"So you've made some progress with the engine, we'll grant you."
00:30:48.888,00:30:50.683,Have you begun to think about a shell?
00:30:50.724,00:30:52.810,"Okay, this is Alex."
00:30:54.186,00:30:55.562,"Okay, Alex. Good."
00:30:57.147,00:31:02.486,"Okay, here we have a concrete block, and in back of that, we have a two-inch steel plate."
00:31:07.658,00:31:09.159,Okay. We're ready.
00:31:14.164,00:31:16.166,And we are... Firing.
00:31:37.437,00:31:38.689,Voila!
00:31:38.731,00:31:39.606,That's...
00:31:41.775,00:31:43.569,That's impossible.
00:31:43.610,00:31:51.034,"BRAZZLETON: I combined the crystals in a tungsten-titanium matrix at supercool temperatures, and that's what did the trick."
00:31:51.076,00:31:53.995,The applications for this are just...
00:31:54.037,00:31:55.038,What do you call this material?
00:31:56.081,00:31:57.916,"Well, its real name has 37 syllables."
00:31:59.167,00:32:00.460,I call it unobtanium.
00:32:01.587,00:32:03.672,Unobtanium?
00:32:03.714,00:32:10.679,"The unobtanium will take the heat and the pressure and transform it to energy, which in turn, reinforces the shell of the ship, you see."
00:32:10.721,00:32:14.474,"So the hotter and the deeper she gets, the stronger she gets..."
00:32:14.516,00:32:15.601,ZIMSKY: Theoretically?
00:32:15.642,00:32:17.686,"Theoretically, yes."
00:32:17.728,00:32:21.981,"This... Is Johnson, don't mind him."
00:32:22.023,00:32:24.943,This is the prototype for the cockpit here.
00:32:24.984,00:32:28.697,"SERGE: Excuse me, Dr. Brazzleton, when do you think the ship will be operational?"
00:32:28.739,00:32:32.409,When I get my fabrication methods perfected...
00:32:32.451,00:32:34.369,"12... Ten years, ten years."
00:32:35.788,00:32:36.914,What would it take to get it done in three months?
00:32:40.918,00:32:43.295,$15 billion. I...
00:32:46.047,00:32:49.676,Will you take a check?
00:32:49.718,00:32:51.136,Why don't you use a credit card?
00:32:51.177,00:32:52.262,Mm.
00:32:57.100,00:32:59.102,MAN: Shit!
00:32:59.144,00:33:02.188,"Mr. Finch, this is the FBI."
00:33:06.318,00:33:07.360,Purge!
00:33:11.030,00:33:12.365,"Come on, purge!"
00:33:25.504,00:33:26.797,FBI! Freeze!
00:33:37.599,00:33:38.475,Okay.
00:33:39.768,00:33:42.187,I know these look like computers.
00:33:42.228,00:33:44.105,Totally not.
00:33:44.147,00:33:46.441,Theodore Donald Finch.
00:33:46.483,00:33:48.443,Carnegie-Mellon University. M.I.T.
00:33:48.485,00:33:50.821,"Worked at the Sun, Lucent, RAND Corp."
00:33:50.863,00:33:53.156,My handle's Rat.
00:33:53.198,00:33:54.700,63 computer fraud indictments.
00:33:54.741,00:33:55.951,64.
00:33:57.744,00:34:00.163,Two convictions.
00:34:00.205,00:34:02.457,"This is strike three, Mr. Finch."
00:34:02.499,00:34:06.461,"You guys aren't here to whack me, are you?"
00:34:06.503,00:34:08.964,"Because I was really, really hoping to have sex before that happened."
00:34:10.632,00:34:17.472,Yeah. I've been told by the FBI-- whose database you crippled last year-- that you are the best in the business.
00:34:17.514,00:34:19.224,So you're about to be given a choice.
00:34:19.265,00:34:20.809,What if I say no?
00:34:20.851,00:34:23.812,"Excuse me, but is this really the best we could do?"
00:34:23.854,00:34:25.438,I mean...
00:34:25.480,00:34:27.482,How many languages do you speak?
00:34:28.901,00:34:30.402,"Well, I speak one."
00:34:30.443,00:34:33.488,"One, zero, one, zero, zero."
00:34:33.530,00:34:43.665,"With that, I could steal your money, your secrets, your sexual fantasies, your whole life, any country, any place, anytime I want."
00:34:43.707,00:34:46.877,We multitask like you breathe.
00:34:46.919,00:34:48.211,I couldn't think as slow as you if I tried.
00:34:52.340,00:34:54.885,Do you have any idea...?
00:34:54.927,00:34:56.302,"Let's just, let's give the kid a break."
00:34:59.681,00:35:01.934,"Okay, it's a phone."
00:35:04.519,00:35:08.815,"Rat, we got a big problem."
00:35:10.609,00:35:12.444,A lot of people are going to die.
00:35:12.485,00:35:13.612,We need your help.
00:35:13.653,00:35:16.782,What kind of help?
00:35:16.823,00:35:19.158,We need you to control the flow of information on the internet.
00:35:19.200,00:35:22.079,You're dreaming.
00:35:22.120,00:35:24.372,Could you...
00:35:25.665,00:35:27.208,You want me to hack the planet?
00:35:30.169,00:35:31.671,He wants me to hack the planet.
00:35:38.386,00:35:40.931,You've got free long distance on that phone... Forever.
00:35:43.391,00:35:45.769,Okay. If I decide to do this...
00:35:47.020,00:35:52.109,I'm going to need an unlimited supply of Xena tapes and hot pockets.
00:35:52.985,00:35:54.945,Hot pockets?
00:35:54.987,00:35:56.029,They help me concentrate.
00:35:57.489,00:35:58.364,Sounds fair.
00:36:08.416,00:36:10.085,"Major Childs, they're ready for you."
00:36:14.422,00:36:22.139,"Major Childs, a clarification: You and you alone were responsible for proposing the descent vectors for the shuttle, correct?"
00:36:22.806,00:36:25.017,"Yes, General."
00:36:25.058,00:36:35.527,We have determined that the class A landing mishap experienced by the shuttle Endeavour was caused by biased navigational data from the ground due to a brief geomagnetic disturbance.
00:36:35.568,00:36:41.992,"Major Childs, the resourcefulness you showed in determining the descent vectors proved that you have exceptional navigation skills."
00:36:43.660,00:36:48.623,"You've brought much credit upon yourself, the space program and the United States Air Force."
00:36:48.665,00:36:51.877,"Congratulations, Major."
00:36:51.918,00:36:57.716,You are reassigned with Commander Iverson and Flight Director Stickley to a new mission effective immediately.
00:36:57.757,00:36:59.009,Transportation is waiting outside.
00:37:00.510,00:37:02.179,"Good luck and Godspeed, Major."
00:37:29.831,00:37:30.874,SERGE: Are you sure you want to wear this tie?
00:37:30.916,00:37:32.751,JOSH: Why?
00:37:32.792,00:37:33.585,"I mean, you look so nervous about it."
00:37:34.669,00:37:35.879,You look so...
00:37:35.921,00:37:36.671,"So, how are you holding up?"
00:37:37.923,00:37:39.966,"Oh, hi."
00:37:40.008,00:37:42.094,I'm about to tell a couple hundred people the world is going to end.
00:37:42.135,00:37:43.845,Well...
00:37:43.887,00:37:45.222,You look good.
00:37:47.057,00:37:48.391,"Well, no, you don't look good."
00:37:48.433,00:37:49.559,Why did he touch his tie like that?
00:37:50.936,00:37:53.021,"Thomas, let me speak with you for a moment."
00:37:53.063,00:37:54.981,"Listen, wouldn't you rather I did this?"
00:37:55.023,00:37:56.357,"I mean, given my reputation, I think that..."
00:37:56.399,00:37:59.027,"No. No, Keyes is in the lead here, Zimsky."
00:37:59.069,00:38:02.155,"Yes. Thomas, this is the most important scientific operation in history."
00:38:02.197,00:38:04.365,"And given my status, I feel that it's my job to present..."
00:38:04.407,00:38:07.410,"Project Destiny was your job, Zimsky."
00:38:07.452,00:38:09.121,And you went way beyond authorized limits.
00:38:09.162,00:38:10.830,And let me tell...
00:38:09.162,00:38:15.001,"And let me tell you, I still, I want to know if Destiny caused this problem."
00:38:15.043,00:38:18.421,"It's highly unlikely, but it may be the solution."
00:38:18.463,00:38:19.839,"Now, I have not finished checking..."
00:38:22.259,00:38:23.176,Rebecca...
00:38:24.844,00:38:26.429,I'm so glad I was wrong.
00:38:26.471,00:38:28.347,Right over left...
00:38:28.389,00:38:29.348,"No, the other left, the other left."
00:38:29.390,00:38:30.767,Gentlemen.
00:38:30.809,00:38:32.685,Gentlemen.
00:38:32.727,00:38:39.985,"Commander Iverson, Major Childs, this is your crew: PURCELL: Dr. Brazzleton knows the ship; Hello."
00:38:40.026,00:38:47.450,"Dr. Zimsky knows the planet; Dr. Leveque knows the weapons system; Excuse me, ladies first. Hi."
00:38:47.492,00:38:52.205,PURCELL: And Dr. Keyes...
00:38:52.247,00:38:53.456,Hi. Rebecca Childs.
00:38:53.498,00:38:54.916,Bob Iverson.
00:38:54.958,00:38:56.751,These are your fellow...
00:38:57.961,00:38:59.296,Terranauts?
00:38:59.337,00:39:00.505,STICKLEY: Hello.
00:39:00.546,00:39:04.425,All this brain power over here is starting to smell like burning batteries.
00:39:09.055,00:39:10.556,"It's the simplest things that are the hardest, huh?"
00:39:10.598,00:39:14.435,Yeah. It's official.
00:39:14.477,00:39:17.314,"Dr. Keyes, I'm sure the people in charge have every confidence in you."
00:39:17.355,00:39:20.108,"Well, the problem is that I'm in charge."
00:39:21.026,00:39:22.652,Can I help you?
00:39:26.364,00:39:28.283,"You're an astronaut, and you can tie a Windsor?"
00:39:29.784,00:39:31.953,Is there anything you can't do?
00:39:31.995,00:39:33.371,Not that I'm aware of.
00:39:35.290,00:39:36.875,I find that incredibly intimidating.
00:39:37.583,00:39:40.170,Yep. Most people do.
00:39:40.212,00:39:41.171,Here.
00:39:43.340,00:39:44.299,Thank you.
00:39:47.677,00:39:50.889,"PURCELL: Let me introduce our project leader, Dr. Joshua Keyes."
00:39:52.140,00:39:53.474,"Thank you, thank you."
00:39:54.517,00:39:56.519,Good evening. Good evening.
00:39:58.813,00:40:01.691,Wow. This looks like a meeting for Nobel Prize Winners Anonymous.
00:40:04.777,00:40:09.324,I know you are all the finest in your fields and have come a long way to be here.
00:40:09.366,00:40:12.369,"So, I'll outline our program over the next three months."
00:40:17.540,00:40:23.629,Dr. Brazzleton will supervise the building of a ship which is capable of reaching the center of our planet.
00:40:23.671,00:40:27.175,"Once there, it will deliver an explosive charge large enough to restart its core."
00:40:30.553,00:40:33.932,Dr. Zimsky will calculate the scale of the explosion needed.
00:40:33.973,00:40:38.770,ZIMSKY: This is a program I designed to simulate the effect of nuclear detonations on the core.
00:40:38.811,00:40:44.859,"If my calculations are correct, a tiny nudge in any direction will force the core back into its normal flow."
00:40:44.901,00:40:46.778,What's a tiny nudge in planetary terms?
00:40:46.819,00:40:48.821,"A thousand megatons, give or take?"
00:40:48.863,00:40:51.490,Tops. Because any more than that would create a core instability.
00:40:51.532,00:40:55.036,SERGE: We made a few monster warheads in the 200-megaton range.
00:40:55.078,00:40:57.080,"Braz, do you think the ship can handle five of these babies?"
00:40:58.290,00:41:00.875,Yeah. I can enlarge the ejection pod...
00:41:00.917,00:41:07.590,"Forgive me, but, you know, I know I'm not the expert here, but what if the core is thicker or thinner?"
00:41:07.632,00:41:10.176,"I mean, what if it's not what you think it is?"
00:41:10.218,00:41:12.929,Isn't that going to affect the way the explosions are...?
00:41:12.971,00:41:14.931,And what if the core is made of cheese?
00:41:17.225,00:41:19.811,"This is all best guess, Commander. That's all science is, is best guess."
00:41:22.605,00:41:24.732,So my best guess is you don't know.
00:41:24.774,00:41:31.614,"JOSH: With luck, irony will break for the good guys for once, and the world's biggest weapons of mass destruction will help save the world."
00:41:31.656,00:41:35.368,The ship will be powered by a small experimental nuclear reactor.
00:41:35.410,00:41:47.922,"It will be divided into six compartments like cars on a train: The locomotive unit, navigation compartment, living quarters, engineering, bomb compartment and finally the weapons-control module."
00:41:47.964,00:41:53.261,"Up to a 45 angle, every compartment will be held level by these gyro control gimbals."
00:41:53.303,00:42:01.019,"But if we do breach a section, bulkhead doors engage automatically, seal off the section in red, and eject."
00:42:02.145,00:42:04.439,Is ejection really the best option?
00:42:04.481,00:42:08.901,Each damaged compartment degrades the entire hull.
00:42:08.943,00:42:11.321,JOSH: The objective is simple.
00:42:11.363,00:42:14.032,The obstacles are gigantic.
00:42:14.073,00:42:21.456,"We're going to need all the help in the world, but if we are to avoid panic and chaos, the world at large can never know what's happening here."
00:42:21.498,00:42:23.541,Which is where our friend Mr. Rat comes in.
00:42:23.582,00:42:25.584,RAT: It's called Virus-Bot.
00:42:25.626,00:42:30.423,It's a computer virus that will seek out files anywhere on the web that contain keywords that we designate and wipes them out.
00:42:31.716,00:42:35.303,"This is my kung-fu, and it is strong."
00:42:35.345,00:42:40.058,"JOSH: Meanwhile, there are a million puzzles ahead of us, and we have three months to solve them."
00:42:40.099,00:42:42.143,We have a committed and ingenious team.
00:42:42.185,00:42:48.649,"We have every resource available to us, and we have the best of the world's scientific and technical talents on our side."
00:42:48.691,00:42:52.070,"With your help we can, we must... Succeed."
00:42:57.534,00:42:58.493,Feedback in the resonance tube.
00:42:58.535,00:42:59.994,"Talk to me, gentlemen."
00:43:00.036,00:43:02.080,SERGE: We are losing structural integrity.
00:43:02.121,00:43:04.290,"No, it's not feedback."
00:43:04.332,00:43:06.625,"No, it's not, no."
00:43:06.667,00:43:08.586,"For God's sakes, Braz, make the call!"
00:43:08.627,00:43:10.088,"No, I'll make the call."
00:43:10.129,00:43:12.048,BECK: 65 knots.
00:43:12.090,00:43:13.632,"Defcon, 8-5 thousand feet."
00:43:13.674,00:43:14.509,"Look, guys..."
00:43:18.846,00:43:20.139,It's a disaster!
00:43:25.728,00:43:28.565,IVERSON: What part of talk to me Don't you guys understand?
00:43:28.606,00:43:31.401,"For the 22nd time in a row, everyone on earth is dead."
00:43:32.944,00:43:36.364,"Let's take a little quiet time, and you all are going to try this again."
00:43:41.202,00:43:42.120,Hi.
00:43:44.163,00:43:45.706,Hi.
00:43:46.958,00:43:48.793,What is this?
00:43:48.834,00:43:52.755,"Uh, well, it's, uh..."
00:43:52.797,00:43:55.258,It's how you're going to...
00:43:55.300,00:43:56.259,"It's, um..."
00:43:57.009,00:43:59.387,Not very good reception.
00:43:59.429,00:44:02.432,"Well, you're looking through three feet of lead at 50 yards away, so..."
00:44:03.975,00:44:04.850,It ain't bad.
00:44:06.727,00:44:10.523,"It's like a CAT scan at a hospital, but it's-it's souped-up."
00:44:12.484,00:44:14.277,I invented it for deep earth surveying.
00:44:14.319,00:44:18.948,"And then the government came in, bought my research, paid off my student loan guys and made me a consultant."
00:44:18.990,00:44:20.741,"I'm sorry, this is really delicate."
00:44:20.783,00:44:21.951,And I have it just the way I want it.
00:44:23.202,00:44:26.205,So... Excuse me.
00:44:28.541,00:44:32.629,"Then they brought me in when the pacemakers quit, and... Boom-- you know, I'm apocalypse boy."
00:44:33.546,00:44:35.881,Apocalypse boy?
00:44:35.923,00:44:37.634,Yeah. I'm having t-shirts made up.
00:44:39.177,00:44:40.845,"Well, hats sell better."
00:44:42.347,00:44:45.266,"You know, it's funny, because that is..."
00:44:45.308,00:44:46.309,Right where it should be.
00:44:47.852,00:44:49.604,I'm sorry. I'm a little ragged around the edges.
00:44:49.646,00:44:51.147,I'm just trying to get this thing to focus correctly.
00:44:51.189,00:44:52.524,"This is really cool, but can I just...?"
00:44:52.565,00:44:54.317,Well... Mm-hmm.
00:45:04.743,00:45:07.913,It's better.
00:45:35.816,00:45:37.193,"God, I hate this sky."
00:46:20.903,00:46:21.904,IVERSON: Crashing one ship isn't enough for you?
00:46:22.947,00:46:24.532,Hey. Practice makes perfect.
00:46:27.619,00:46:29.495,You can practice all you like.
00:46:29.537,00:46:30.747,"So you keep reminding me, sir."
00:46:33.874,00:46:36.502,"You know, I doubt you're even going to listen to this, but I'm going to give it a shot."
00:46:39.213,00:46:41.299,Being a leader isn't about ability.
00:46:41.340,00:46:42.550,It's about responsibility.
00:46:44.552,00:46:46.803,"Got it, sir."
00:46:46.845,00:46:49.474,"I mean, you're not just responsible for making good decisions."
00:46:49.515,00:46:50.725,You have to be responsible for the bad ones.
00:46:52.769,00:46:55.812,You got to be ready to make the shitty call.
00:46:55.854,00:46:57.440,What makes you think I'm not?
00:46:59.233,00:47:00.443,You haven't hit anything you couldn't beat.
00:47:02.361,00:47:04.697,You were the one who figured out how to save the shuttle.
00:47:04.739,00:47:07.116,"You made me, you made the rest of NASA just look like an ass."
00:47:09.243,00:47:11.287,It's just that you're used to winning...
00:47:15.625,00:47:17.502,...And you're not really a leader until you've lost.
00:47:23.591,00:47:25.551,BRAZZLETON: $20 billion has been spent developing this system...
00:47:25.593,00:47:26.803,"JOSH: Oh, come on, guys, the chefs at NASA..."
00:47:26.843,00:47:28.012,I wouldn't call them chefs.
00:47:30.598,00:47:33.892,I want wine! I need wine!
00:47:33.934,00:47:34.811,Whoa!
00:47:38.272,00:47:39.774,That's high-level static discharge.
00:47:43.235,00:47:45.154,I think we should check this out.
00:47:45.196,00:47:46.322,This doesn't look so good.
00:47:55.623,00:47:56.915,JOSH: It's a lightning superstorm.
00:47:56.957,00:47:58.459,Popping up all over the world.
00:47:58.501,00:48:00.002,Got 'em. Tracking.
00:48:03.422,00:48:06.258,Uh-oh. Rome does not look good.
00:49:58.078,00:50:00.372,This planet is decaying faster than we thought.
00:50:00.414,00:50:02.750,It's just the start.
00:50:02.792,00:50:05.210,Soon they'll be EM spikes and microwaves will break through the weak spots and...
00:50:05.252,00:50:08.004,All right. Get this ship in the ground. Now.
00:50:39.411,00:50:41.998,Ah! Summer in the Pacific.
00:50:42.999,00:50:45.125,"Yeah, the world is inside out."
00:51:07.272,00:51:08.733,"SERGE: I was saving this for later, but, uh..."
00:51:10.026,00:51:11.151,This is the time for...
00:51:13.029,00:51:14.321,"Josh, do you mind?"
00:51:14.363,00:51:16.532,"No, not at all. Yeah."
00:51:16.574,00:51:18.325,We should have a name for this baby.
00:51:18.367,00:51:20.202,"Oh, she's called Virgil, actually."
00:51:20.244,00:51:22.204,Virgil-- the poet that led our man into the depths of hell?
00:51:22.246,00:51:23.622,That's it.
00:51:23.664,00:51:24.832,"Well, here's to Virgil."
00:51:26.667,00:51:28.961,To the planet.
00:51:29.003,00:51:29.921,To Virgil.
00:51:37.636,00:51:40.096,"No flashbulbs, no press, nobody cheering."
00:51:40.138,00:51:41.390,It's.... Weird.
00:51:44.226,00:51:45.143,Let's go.
00:52:02.327,00:52:05.205,"IVERSON: Cabin pressure, TSI, 3.5."
00:52:05.247,00:52:07.207,BECK: Check.
00:52:07.249,00:52:08.793,ECS cabin repress open.
00:52:10.086,00:52:11.587,And repress VLV closed.
00:52:11.963,00:52:13.213,Check.
00:52:13.255,00:52:14.548,Fluid dump valve.
00:52:14.590,00:52:20.888,"We are about to begin our journey into the heart of the cosmos, close."
00:52:22.056,00:52:24.308,Where we find therein check.
00:52:24.349,00:52:25.684,The secrets of the universe...
00:52:25.726,00:52:27.937,...3.5 psi.
00:52:27.979,00:52:29.480,...The mysteries of time...
00:52:29.521,00:52:31.732,Helen circuit lockup.
00:52:31.774,00:52:33.358,Check.
00:52:34.777,00:52:36.278,"Deep Earth control, this is Virgil."
00:52:36.320,00:52:37.279,Signal check.
00:52:38.322,00:52:40.116,This is Deep Earth control.
00:52:40.156,00:52:42.910,I have thumbs-up across the board.
00:52:42.952,00:52:44.286,You are clear to initiate power-up.
00:52:54.505,00:52:56.465,Reactor power confirmed.
00:52:56.507,00:52:59.426,"STICKLEY: At 1,000 rpm, we will countdown to launch. On your mark."
00:53:00.427,00:53:01.637,"Pad leader, stand by for launch."
00:53:04.598,00:53:05.516,"All right, Virgil."
00:53:07.351,00:53:08.644,Mark.
00:53:08.686,00:53:20.196,"Gantry count. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one..."
00:53:54.106,00:53:55.566,500 feet.
00:53:55.607,00:53:56.483,Leveling out.
00:54:09.121,00:54:11.874,"Okay, guys, let's swing forward."
00:54:17.963,00:54:19.297,800 feet.
00:54:20.799,00:54:21.633,"Light 'em up, Beck."
00:54:26.055,00:54:27.431,Gyro leveling operational.
00:54:27.472,00:54:28.390,Hull integrity holding.
00:55:00.672,00:55:03.134,I'm going to keep her nose down about 15 degrees and...
00:55:04.342,00:55:05.427,"Oh, my goodness."
00:55:28.909,00:55:30.953,They're singing to us.
00:55:30.995,00:55:34.248,"BRAZZLETON: Virgil's resonance tubes are powered up, so they're vibrating sub sonically."
00:55:34.290,00:55:36.292,"Actually, we're singing to them."
00:55:50.388,00:55:51.890,What's our depth?
00:55:51.932,00:55:54.268,"1,600 feet, plenty of room on both sides."
00:55:54.310,00:55:55.894,Hull integrity is good.
00:55:55.936,00:55:57.938,You sure?
00:55:57.980,00:55:59.231,I think we'll be needing additional control.
00:56:03.986,00:56:04.945,"Stick, I'm getting a seismic reading."
00:56:04.987,00:56:06.780,What's happening?
00:56:06.822,00:56:08.782,T-phase.
00:56:15.914,00:56:17.666,Still think the water-launch was a good idea?
00:56:17.708,00:56:19.751,"Yes, yes, I chose this location because the crust is thin here."
00:56:19.793,00:56:21.419,The downside is...
00:56:21.461,00:56:22.713,There's lots of seismic activity.
00:56:22.754,00:56:23.755,"4,000 feet."
00:56:26.717,00:56:28.135,You see that rock?
00:56:28.177,00:56:29.011,That is not good.
00:56:36.894,00:56:38.229,We're losing steering here.
00:56:38.270,00:56:40.356,There's some kind of crosscurrent.
00:56:41.357,00:56:42.524,"14,000 feet."
00:56:56.955,00:56:58.874,"Okay, guys, fasten your seat belts."
00:56:58.916,00:56:59.958,We're turning into the skid.
00:57:11.887,00:57:12.888,"18,000."
00:57:14.265,00:57:15.599,"18,500."
00:57:15.640,00:57:16.725,They're going way too fast.
00:57:31.865,00:57:33.242,"21,000 feet."
00:57:33.284,00:57:35.411,"We hit the wall, we're rabbits on the highway."
00:57:35.452,00:57:37.288,"Pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure."
00:57:37.329,00:57:39.164,"What do you mean, pressure?"
00:57:39.206,00:57:40.540,I said the pressure makes us stronger.
00:57:40.582,00:57:41.417,We just don't have enough of it yet.
00:57:43.961,00:57:46.630,"We're at 25,000 feet."
00:57:46.671,00:57:47.798,What?
00:57:47.839,00:57:48.548,Go to full throttle.
00:57:51.260,00:57:53.345,"Standby to engage front and lateral lasers, please."
00:57:55.222,00:57:57.599,But what if we hit bottom in ten seconds here?
00:57:57.641,00:57:59.059,Just give it a couple of more seconds.
00:57:59.101,00:58:00.394,The lasers will fire.
00:58:04.648,00:58:05.441,"No, there's not enough time for power-up."
00:58:10.404,00:58:12.030,"27,000 feet."
00:58:12.072,00:58:13.073,BRAZZLETON: The lasers will deploy.
00:58:16.118,00:58:17.494,"29,000 feet."
00:58:17.535,00:58:18.662,Do it!
00:58:20.998,00:58:22.124,Do it!
00:59:08.170,00:59:10.630,And we've got a signal.
00:59:10.672,00:59:11.673,All right.
00:59:17.804,00:59:19.097,All right.
00:59:21.475,00:59:22.726,Switching on electron spin burst transmitters.
00:59:24.061,00:59:27.647,"Plotting through lowest density material, reconfiguring every five minutes."
00:59:27.689,00:59:31.109,Hull integrity 100%.
00:59:31.151,00:59:32.403,All green on the bomb compartment.
00:59:32.444,00:59:34.446,Speed is 60 knots.
00:59:36.823,00:59:40.118,"All right, we'll be through the crust in 15 minutes and into the mantle."
00:59:40.160,00:59:42.704,"24 hours to the core, and then assuming we survive..."
00:59:42.746,00:59:45.290,Assuming?
00:59:45.332,00:59:47.625,Another 15 hours to the inner core-outer core border.
00:59:48.460,00:59:49.378,They're doing well.
00:59:50.628,00:59:52.839,The crust is just rock.
00:59:52.881,00:59:55.008,Now it gets interesting.
00:59:55.050,00:59:56.843,"Virgil, can we get a status check?"
00:59:56.885,00:59:58.387,We're about to make the transition into the mantle.
01:00:28.917,01:00:30.001,"Come on, come on."
01:00:45.809,01:00:48.395,"exterior pressure is 800,000 pounds per square inch."
01:00:49.313,01:00:52.566,And hull integrity is 100%.
01:00:52.608,01:00:56.487,It is as if we we're diving through the memories of the planet.
01:00:56.528,01:01:01.408,But we are about to pass from memory into madness.
01:01:01.450,01:01:05.662,Are you going to be doing that Carl Sagan narration all the way to the core?
01:01:05.703,01:01:07.456,I beg your pardon?
01:01:07.498,01:01:10.626,"I-I have an obligation to my students, to my readers..."
01:01:10.667,01:01:12.419,An obligation to make a book deal perhaps?
01:01:12.461,01:01:13.878,"Two book deals, if you'd like to know the truth."
01:01:13.920,01:01:15.506,I read that last book.
01:01:15.547,01:01:16.673,"ZIMSKY: Oh, really?"
01:01:16.714,01:01:17.966,When did you learn how to read?
01:01:18.008,01:01:19.259,BRAZZLETON: You amaze me.
01:01:38.487,01:01:39.321,IVERSON: People.
01:01:40.780,01:01:42.658,Drs. Zimsky and Keyes?
01:01:46.828,01:01:49.581,You guys are our resident geophysicists.
01:01:49.623,01:01:54.670,"Um, the mantle is a chemical hodgepodge of..."
01:01:54.711,01:01:58.715,Say it with me: I don't know.
01:01:58.756,01:02:02.802,"Wise men say, when in doubt, you should go around."
01:02:02.844,01:02:05.930,No. It's too big.
01:02:05.972,01:02:08.183,Anything that we can't go through displays as black.
01:02:08.225,01:02:09.976,So what's...
01:02:10.519,01:02:12.396,It's nothing.
01:02:12.437,01:02:14.272,What do you mean?
01:02:15.273,01:02:16.400,JOSH: It's nothing.
01:02:18.943,01:02:20.487,It's empty space.
01:02:20.529,01:02:21.613,I...
01:02:23.948,01:02:25.867,I never taught the computer how to read empty space.
01:02:25.909,01:02:26.993,And I never taught Virgil how to fly.
01:02:28.119,01:02:28.995,"Oh, God!"
01:02:52.018,01:02:53.228,"Oh, no, man!"
01:03:06.658,01:03:07.576,"IVERSON: Oh, dear God."
01:04:00.337,01:04:01.713,"Serge, you all right?"
01:04:03.340,01:04:04.341,Yeah.
01:04:11.848,01:04:13.224,IVERSON: Anybody hurt?
01:04:13.266,01:04:14.726,No. You okay?
01:04:15.977,01:04:17.937,What's that?
01:04:17.979,01:04:19.690,From the cooling system.
01:04:21.650,01:04:24.027,I told you to go around her.
01:04:24.068,01:04:26.112,Where in God's name are we?
01:04:26.154,01:04:28.156,Whatever has us jammed up is inside our lasers.
01:04:32.452,01:04:33.411,We're not going anywhere.
01:04:38.375,01:04:39.334,Powering down.
01:04:46.174,01:04:47.925,"Josh, is there any other image you can pull up?"
01:04:49.511,01:04:52.263,"Whatever it is, it's also inside our MRI cameras."
01:04:54.974,01:04:57.728,We have to go outside.
01:04:57.769,01:05:00.647,"Believe me, I hate to admit it, but I think he's right."
01:05:00.689,01:05:02.023,I'm coming. I want to collect samples.
01:05:02.065,01:05:03.274,"IVERSON: Wait, hang on, hang on."
01:05:02.065,01:05:07.904,"BECK: Wait, wait, the first problem is, the only way out of this ship is the way we came in, which is through the impeller outlet..."
01:05:07.945,01:05:09.406,"Which is still at 5,000 degrees."
01:05:09.447,01:05:11.491,"Exactly, I mean..."
01:05:11.533,01:05:14.327,BRAZZLETON: I'll just flush it with liquid nitrogen from the cooling system.
01:05:14.369,01:05:17.247,Wait. The cooling system that's keeping us from roasting to death in this ship?
01:05:18.540,01:05:21.042,"Well, just a small part of it."
01:05:24.588,01:05:25.797,Alternatives?
01:05:27.549,01:05:28.466,Anybody.
01:05:44.232,01:05:46.192,"ZIMSKY: Whoa, whoa, that's it."
01:05:46.234,01:05:48.236,JOSH: It's like a giant...
01:05:49.028,01:05:51.531,Where the hell are we?
01:05:51.573,01:05:53.575,"IVERSON: Well, the good news is, it looks like the suits can take the pressure."
01:05:56.536,01:05:58.830,It's completely jammed the laser assembly.
01:05:58.872,01:06:00.998,We just...
01:05:58.872,01:06:02.459,"We got to hope, if we can cut it loose, they're still functional."
01:06:02.500,01:06:03.543,Okay.
01:06:05.169,01:06:06.713,Got it.
01:06:06.755,01:06:09.299,"Beck, try the lights, will you?"
01:06:14.471,01:06:15.764,"Oh, it's magnificent."
01:06:15.806,01:06:16.598,"Oh, my God."
01:06:18.558,01:06:20.101,Aladdin's cave.
01:06:21.227,01:06:23.062,It's like a crystal Grand Canyon.
01:06:39.203,01:06:41.331,I think it's a geode.
01:06:41.372,01:06:43.124,But I don't understand how it could have survived down here.
01:06:44.709,01:06:46.670,"Cobalt shell, maybe?"
01:06:46.711,01:06:50.214,"In a magma environment of 5,000 degrees."
01:06:50.256,01:06:52.258,Something would have to protect it.
01:06:52.300,01:06:53.426,Unbelievable.
01:06:53.468,01:06:54.886,Zimsky.
01:06:56.471,01:07:03.979,"We're inside a giant gem bubble, wrapped in a cobalt cocoon 700 miles below the surface of the earth."
01:07:07.273,01:07:08.650,Hell of a day.
01:07:09.860,01:07:11.862,"Yes, it is."
01:07:11.903,01:07:12.821,BRAZZLETON: I'll start cutting.
01:07:12.863,01:07:14.364,"IVERSON: Okay, Braz."
01:07:14.405,01:07:15.740,I'm going to check the hull.
01:07:15.782,01:07:16.783,Okay.
01:07:25.041,01:07:25.959,"Oh, no."
01:07:27.043,01:07:28.461,Zimsky!
01:07:28.503,01:07:29.880,"Zimsky, look!"
01:07:29.921,01:07:30.714,It's an amethyst.
01:07:32.423,01:07:34.384,"ZIMSKY: Oh, God, we've breached the shell."
01:07:50.942,01:07:52.610,"Guys, you don't have to be here!"
01:07:54.029,01:07:55.238,"Well, I think that means me."
01:07:56.280,01:07:57.281,Orders are orders.
01:08:05.582,01:08:06.791,"Wait, Josh."
01:08:08.543,01:08:09.878,The problem is I'm losing oxygen.
01:08:09.920,01:08:11.379,"Braz, what can I do?"
01:08:11.421,01:08:12.255,Check the feeds for me.
01:08:13.798,01:08:15.091,"Check the feeds for me, Josh."
01:08:20.346,01:08:21.806,I'm coming. I'm coming as fast as I can.
01:08:23.099,01:08:26.061,"SERGE: Hey, guys, at this rate we have three minutes before the lava gets to us."
01:08:26.728,01:08:27.604,Come on.
01:08:33.192,01:08:34.861,BRAZZLETON: It's not going to work without oxygen!
01:08:34.903,01:08:35.904,We're losing oxygen!
01:08:46.372,01:08:47.958,I fixed it. Now cut!
01:08:47.999,01:08:49.667,That's good. It's working now.
01:08:49.709,01:08:50.919,It's working well now!
01:08:50.961,01:08:52.462,"That's good, Josh!"
01:09:03.723,01:09:05.141,Josh's vital signs are dropping.
01:09:05.516,01:09:06.517,What?
01:09:11.898,01:09:12.941,Serge!
01:09:16.736,01:09:18.195,BRAZZLETON: You're almost there.
01:09:18.237,01:09:19.864,"You're almost there, Josh."
01:09:33.461,01:09:34.462,Josh!
01:09:51.270,01:09:53.690,Joshua!
01:09:53.731,01:09:55.399,"SERGE: Okay, guys, connect the oxygen."
01:09:55.441,01:09:57.443,"Braz, you got that?"
01:09:57.485,01:09:58.695,Good. I got to check these lasers.
01:10:00.697,01:10:01.489,"IVERSON: Okay, Beck, turn 'em over."
01:10:04.492,01:10:05.994,"Pre-lasers only, if you don't mind."
01:10:06.036,01:10:07.203,Initiating.
01:10:09.747,01:10:11.207,This better work.
01:10:17.296,01:10:18.882,We got lucky-- I think we're going to swim right out of this one.
01:10:21.342,01:10:22.301,Bob?
01:10:23.302,01:10:24.345,Huh?
01:10:39.110,01:10:40.195,Bob?
01:10:46.492,01:10:47.577,Bob...
01:10:51.664,01:10:53.208,"Braz, come on, it's over."
01:10:53.249,01:10:54.458,Okay. Okay.
01:10:56.086,01:10:57.212,Beck! Beck!
01:10:58.088,01:10:59.505,We're coming in.
01:11:01.049,01:11:02.717,Initiate start sequence.
01:11:03.300,01:11:04.886,Beck!
01:11:04.928,01:11:06.303,"Beck, do you hear me?"
01:11:07.764,01:11:09.015,Start the impellers!
01:11:12.309,01:11:14.020,"The door, open the door."
01:11:14.896,01:11:16.564,Activate bulkhead doors!
01:11:17.607,01:11:18.816,"Now, Beck!"
01:12:00.566,01:12:02.110,BECK: You okay? You're going to be weak.
01:12:02.152,01:12:03.778,You're okay.
01:12:03.820,01:12:04.445,Good man.
01:12:07.240,01:12:09.867,"So, um..."
01:12:09.909,01:12:13.037,"We have some good news, and, uh... And we have some bad news."
01:12:13.079,01:12:15.706,"Uh, good news."
01:12:15.748,01:12:17.667,"Well, we're alive and we're moving."
01:12:19.669,01:12:21.629,That's g... That's good news.
01:12:22.672,01:12:24.799,"Oh, it is hot in here."
01:12:24.841,01:12:28.803,"BRAZZLETON: Yeah, that nitro we flushed out of the cooling system, it-it's causing things just to heat up a little."
01:12:28.845,01:12:30.805,I'm going to go back and just make some adjustments.
01:12:30.847,01:12:33.057,I'll lend you a hand.
01:12:33.099,01:12:34.225,"I'm going to check your heartbeat, okay?"
01:12:35.685,01:12:37.436,"Thanks, Braz. Appreciate it."
01:12:40.106,01:12:42.358,"So, that's the bad news?"
01:12:42.399,01:12:43.318,No.
01:12:45.320,01:12:47.322,Commander Iverson died.
01:12:49.824,01:12:52.576,"We're living, and he would want to, um..."
01:12:52.618,01:12:55.079,"He'd want us to complete our mission, so I think that it's important that we all..."
01:12:59.542,01:13:00.835,It's all right.
01:13:02.003,01:13:03.171,Thank you.
01:13:04.172,01:13:05.340,I'm sorry.
01:13:09.593,01:13:12.388,"Let's give him a second, okay?"
01:13:12.429,01:13:13.806,He deserves that.
01:13:20.188,01:13:21.689,"Oh, God, this all just seems too big, doesn't it?"
01:13:25.651,01:13:27.237,I think you were attempting the impossible.
01:13:27.278,01:13:28.321,"You were trying to save the world, and..."
01:13:30.656,01:13:32.200,It's overwhelming.
01:13:33.701,01:13:36.579,I came here to save my wife and my two children and...
01:13:36.620,01:13:38.539,Six billion lives-- it's too much.
01:13:41.125,01:13:44.087,I just hope I'm-I'm smart enough and brave enough to save three.
01:13:46.505,01:13:49.717,"You did a nice job, Joshua."
01:13:49.759,01:13:50.801,You'd have done the same thing.
01:13:50.843,01:13:52.303,"Well, maybe, maybe."
01:14:03.106,01:14:05.608,Hey... Who's steering the ship?
01:14:06.692,01:14:08.652,Video screen autopilot.
01:14:08.694,01:14:09.862,I hope he knows the way.
01:14:10.654,01:14:11.989,You and me both.
01:14:15.368,01:14:20.206,So... You're really a college professor?
01:14:20.248,01:14:24.752,"You're not from the CIA, or the NSA or any of those three-letter places?"
01:14:24.794,01:14:27.046,No. I am a boring college professor.
01:14:28.131,01:14:30.174,"Wrong place, wrong place."
01:14:33.469,01:14:34.971,That was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
01:14:37.598,01:14:39.434,"Well, I just, I just..."
01:14:39.475,01:14:44.439,"Listen, the lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl as is my custom in dangerous situations."
01:14:53.906,01:14:56.951,"BECK: Hey, guys, we're close to the mantle core interface."
01:14:57.785,01:14:59.287,Where are you?
01:14:59.329,01:15:00.455,"SERGE: Key's in, Dr. Brazzleton."
01:15:02.206,01:15:03.791,BRAZZLETON: Ready.
01:15:03.833,01:15:05.460,"SERGE: Okay, the code..."
01:15:05.501,01:15:07.295,"...Luxurious, beautiful weapons control..."
01:15:08.921,01:15:11.090,Checking the controls on the nukes.
01:15:11.132,01:15:11.924,SERGE: This is the birthday of my daughter.
01:15:11.966,01:15:13.343,0-1-3-1-9-9-5.
01:15:14.344,01:15:15.428,Ready?
01:15:15.470,01:15:18.473,"Three, two and one.."
01:15:20.057,01:15:21.351,Thank you.
01:15:21.392,01:15:23.686,Great. All green.
01:15:23.727,01:15:25.729,Great. So we have to synchronize the babies now.
01:15:30.234,01:15:31.735,Just a second.
01:15:35.031,01:15:36.491,"All right, now let's put them to bed."
01:15:39.410,01:15:41.078,"Zimsky, could you please come up here for a second?"
01:15:43.122,01:15:44.581,We're not supposed to go through anything black.
01:15:44.623,01:15:46.625,"Yes, so please don't."
01:15:46.667,01:15:47.918,What is this?
01:15:50.296,01:15:51.506,They're scattered everywhere.
01:15:54.717,01:15:56.719,"Oh, my God!"
01:15:57.470,01:15:59.430,Great.
01:15:59.472,01:16:01.098,You might want to sit down and buckle up.
01:16:01.140,01:16:02.475,We're on a collision course here.
01:16:10.274,01:16:11.817,All rightie. Careful.
01:16:16.197,01:16:20.410,"Guys, we're dodging diamonds the size of Cape Cod, so bear with me."
01:16:20.451,01:16:22.078,Not exactly nimble here.
01:16:22.119,01:16:23.829,Diamonds? I want some.
01:16:23.871,01:16:25.039,Can I help?
01:16:47.061,01:16:47.937,Ooh!
01:16:50.856,01:16:52.108,Okay.
01:16:56.112,01:16:57.780,"BECK: Okay, it looks like we're in the clear."
01:17:06.830,01:17:08.374,"Guys! Weapons control, get out!"
01:17:08.958,01:17:10.167,Get out now!
01:17:20.303,01:17:21.262,JOSH: Serge!
01:17:24.723,01:17:26.892,Serge! What the hell are you doing?
01:17:26.934,01:17:28.394,Come on!
01:17:28.436,01:17:29.562,My notebook!
01:17:29.604,01:17:30.563,Now!
01:17:34.442,01:17:35.485,Serge!
01:17:43.033,01:17:45.244,"Take the time reg, Joshua!"
01:17:45.286,01:17:47.538,Come on Serge! Come on!
01:17:47.580,01:17:48.956,My notes!
01:17:49.665,01:17:51.417,"God, no, Serge!"
01:17:51.459,01:17:53.002,It's okay.
01:17:53.043,01:17:54.670,"Serge, come on! No!"
01:17:54.711,01:17:55.796,Serge!
01:17:56.713,01:17:58.508,"Come on, man!"
01:17:58.549,01:18:00.551,Leave the box!
01:18:00.593,01:18:01.802,We can get him!
01:18:03.887,01:18:05.306,"Hold on, Serge!"
01:18:19.820,01:18:21.656,Beck! Beck!
01:18:21.697,01:18:23.073,Override the ejection system!
01:18:24.700,01:18:26.243,"ZIMSKY: Beck, no!"
01:18:26.285,01:18:27.703,One damaged compartment threatens the whole ship!
01:18:31.707,01:18:34.168,Override the ejection system!
01:18:40.591,01:18:41.842,"JOSH: Serge, we're right here."
01:18:41.884,01:18:43.802,"We're not going to forget about you, man."
01:18:43.844,01:18:45.680,Serge! Serge...ear me?
01:18:45.721,01:18:47.056,"Hey, buddy, look in your monitor right now."
01:18:47.097,01:18:49.433,"Serge, look in your monitor."
01:18:49.475,01:18:52.144,"Josh, I can't see you."
01:18:52.186,01:18:54.564,"Braz is going to override the doors manually, okay?"
01:18:54.605,01:18:56.940,We're working on it right now.
01:18:56.982,01:18:58.359,"Going as fast as I can, fast as I can."
01:19:00.069,01:19:02.154,"Okay, I'm scared."
01:19:02.196,01:19:03.698,"Shouldn't be two seconds, all right?"
01:19:05.115,01:19:07.618,"Beck, override the ejection systems, okay?"
01:19:07.660,01:19:08.869,Damn. I don't think Beck can hear me.
01:19:10.246,01:19:12.915,"Serge, look at me now. Serge!"
01:19:12.956,01:19:15.251,"Serge, we're right here, okay?"
01:19:15.292,01:19:17.378,"I'm going to get you out of here. We're working on it, all right?"
01:19:19.004,01:19:21.048,Stay with me here.
01:19:21.090,01:19:23.133,what to do.
01:19:23.175,01:19:25.261,Can you hear me now?
01:19:25.302,01:19:26.762,"I'm not going to let you go, man."
01:19:26.803,01:19:28.847,"I'm not going to let you go, all right?"
01:19:28.889,01:19:32.602,"Stay with me here, okay?"
01:19:32.643,01:19:36.021,"I'm going to come to Paris and we'll go out, all right?"
01:19:36.063,01:19:37.398,"After this is all said and done, all right?"
01:19:37.440,01:19:38.608,Josh!
01:19:40.234,01:19:41.944,Serge! Serge!
01:19:42.361,01:19:43.404,Serge!
01:19:45.573,01:19:46.657,Serge!
01:20:39.710,01:20:40.961,Did you reset the overrides?
01:20:44.214,01:20:45.758,I never pushed them.
01:20:47.301,01:20:48.636,You let him die.
01:20:51.764,01:20:53.307,"Actually, you really want to know?"
01:20:53.349,01:20:55.434,I killed him twice.
01:20:55.476,01:20:57.936,"First when I hit the diamond, and then when I didn't hit the override."
01:20:57.978,01:21:00.939,Do you want me to feel any worse about that than I already do? It's not possible.
01:21:00.981,01:21:02.483,Why are you being so smug about that?
01:21:02.525,01:21:03.693,Could you have made the decision?
01:21:03.734,01:21:06.111,Yes.
01:21:06.153,01:21:07.863,"If you would've hit that switch, I could've got him outta there!"
01:21:07.904,01:21:09.239,I was yelling for you!
01:21:13.910,01:21:15.496,Take it and look at it!
01:21:16.955,01:21:18.666,I was two inches from him!
01:21:19.333,01:21:22.336,"I was two inches, and I told you to put the door up and you didn't!"
01:21:23.170,01:21:25.130,I was screaming for you!
01:21:25.172,01:21:26.757,Why didn't you do it?!
01:21:28.091,01:21:29.552,Because I had to make that decision.
01:21:30.219,01:21:31.303,Fate or God...
01:21:31.345,01:21:33.138,No! You...
01:21:33.180,01:21:34.890,Damn it!
01:21:34.931,01:21:36.975,Serge died so that we could complete our job.
01:21:37.017,01:21:38.561,"Oh, that's right, the job of saving the world."
01:21:38.602,01:21:41.731,"Not the whole world, Josh!"
01:22:34.157,01:22:36.076,"Virgil, you are approaching core interface."
01:22:36.118,01:22:37.578,Are you good to go?
01:22:37.620,01:22:39.329,BRAZZLETON: Josh?
01:22:39.371,01:22:40.956,"Josh, can you hear me?"
01:22:43.876,01:22:45.419,"Josh, can you hear me?"
01:22:50.382,01:22:51.801,"Ready as we'll ever be, Stick."
01:22:52.802,01:22:53.969,Dr. Keyes.
01:22:56.138,01:22:57.306,Right here.
01:23:01.351,01:23:03.437,"Deep Earth, we are green and good to go."
01:23:44.019,01:23:46.313,We just got a huge speed jump.
01:23:47.314,01:23:48.482,110.
01:23:48.524,01:23:50.066,30... 140.
01:23:53.278,01:23:55.405,Our speed's jumped because the density of the core is different than our estimates.
01:23:55.447,01:23:56.448,It's lighter than we thought.
01:23:56.490,01:23:58.074,So much for best guesses.
01:23:58.116,01:23:59.785,BECK: I'm fine with this.
01:23:59.827,01:24:03.622,"At this rate, we'll, what-- hit the inner core in a little over five hours."
01:24:03.664,01:24:04.874,I think we finally bought some luck.
01:24:04.915,01:24:06.375,Braz?
01:24:06.416,01:24:09.503,Would you please punch the new core density into the equations for the nuclear detonation?
01:24:15.384,01:24:16.760,Please tell me this is enough.
01:24:24.351,01:24:28.689,"BECK: You're telling me the 1,000 megatons of nuclear warheads we hauled down here isn't going to cut it?"
01:24:30.357,01:24:32.860,No. This core material is too thin.
01:24:32.902,01:24:34.945,What?
01:24:32.902,01:24:36.989,The energy waves from the explosion won't spread far enough.
01:24:42.703,01:24:44.246,That's it.
01:24:44.287,01:24:47.207,We go home.
01:24:47.249,01:24:48.751,BRAZZLETON: Home?
01:24:48.792,01:24:49.919,ZIMSKY: Our commander is dead.
01:24:49.960,01:24:51.837,Our weapons specialist is dead.
01:24:51.879,01:24:53.672,Our weapons control systems are gone.
01:24:53.714,01:24:57.885,"We don't know whether we can arm the nuclear devices, and our plan to fix the core no longer works. So..."
01:24:59.094,01:25:01.055,We have failed.
01:25:01.096,01:25:05.642,"We have failed, and we go home, and we go to the alternative."
01:25:05.684,01:25:07.394,What alternative?
01:25:07.436,01:25:11.189,"General, this is Dr. Conrad Zimsky."
01:25:11.231,01:25:13.275,Repeat.
01:25:14.317,01:25:15.277,Damn.
01:25:20.074,01:25:21.784,I need to know everything to do my job.
01:25:22.910,01:25:23.994,You don't have to know this.
01:25:25.746,01:25:28.791,"General, it is my job to ensure the safety of this mission."
01:25:30.500,01:25:32.628,Anything that affects it is my business.
01:25:32.669,01:25:33.963,Now what the hell is Destiny?
01:25:34.004,01:25:36.423,It's a device.
01:25:36.465,01:25:41.261,"Deep Earth Seismic Trigger Initiative, DEST-INI. Destiny."
01:25:43.263,01:25:48.102,We had reason to believe that our enemies were building a weapon that could generate targeted seismic events.
01:25:50.562,01:25:53.690,They would be able to create massive earthquakes under our territory.
01:25:53.732,01:25:55.734,No way of telling who did it.
01:25:55.776,01:25:57.444,"So... We built one, too."
01:25:58.236,01:26:00.196,M.A.D.
01:26:00.238,01:26:03.366,Mutually assured destruction.
01:26:03.408,01:26:04.868,Beautiful.
01:26:04.910,01:26:07.704,They built it first.
01:26:07.746,01:26:12.626,"I beamed high-powered electromagnetic energy waves down deep earth fault lines, and, you know."
01:26:12.668,01:26:15.462,"Zimsky, what makes you think that Destiny would even touch the core?"
01:26:15.504,01:26:16.296,JOSH: 'Cause it already did.
01:26:19.549,01:26:21.093,This isn't a fluke.
01:26:22.385,01:26:23.929,We killed the planet.
01:26:23.971,01:26:26.849,BECK: You keep saying that the core is too big to be affected by anything short of nukes.
01:26:27.766,01:26:29.518,So...
01:26:29.559,01:26:31.145,"Throw a small wrench into a big engine, you can still stall it."
01:26:34.731,01:26:36.650,"Deep Earth, this is Virgil."
01:26:36.692,01:26:39.028,We require clarification on the status of Project Destiny.
01:26:41.155,01:26:42.906,"Why weren't we notified of this, sir?"
01:26:42.948,01:26:44.116,"Because you didn't need to know, Major."
01:26:46.535,01:26:48.704,PURCELL: Now you may not like this.
01:26:48.745,01:26:55.293,"But it's my job, and I do it for my country, and if we don't develop these devices, someone worse will and they will use them against us."
01:26:55.335,01:26:57.171,But you have my word.
01:26:57.212,01:27:02.676,"No one in this administration-- no one, had any idea that this could happen."
01:27:02.718,01:27:04.845,So the device that kill the planet is your backup plan?
01:27:06.180,01:27:08.557,An electric shock can stop a heart.
01:27:08.598,01:27:10.266,It can certainly restart one.
01:27:10.308,01:27:12.352,Destiny will work.
01:27:12.394,01:27:14.688,It has to.
01:27:14.730,01:27:18.067,"If you fire that thing again with the core already stalled, it'll terminally destabilize it."
01:27:18.108,01:27:23.238,"Yes, granted-- there is a marginal risk involved, but given the circumstances, I hardly see that as an alternative."
01:27:23.279,01:27:25.574,"No, Zimsky, listen to me."
01:27:25.615,01:27:27.325,There'll be earthquakes big enough to rip us to pieces.
01:27:27.367,01:27:29.285,Dr. Keyes.
01:27:29.327,01:27:32.372,I'm afraid it's all we've got.
01:27:32.414,01:27:33.749,"Now, I have orders from the president."
01:27:33.790,01:27:35.333,"Come home, Virgil."
01:27:35.375,01:27:37.127,"Well, what about plan C?"
01:27:37.169,01:27:38.921,What? What?
01:27:38.962,01:27:40.630,"Well, plan C."
01:27:40.672,01:27:43.383,We restart the core...
01:27:43.425,01:27:45.928,"We don't do it, you fire Destiny."
01:27:45.969,01:27:47.470,I can't wait for you to get out of there.
01:27:47.512,01:27:49.181,Then don't.
01:27:49.223,01:27:50.849,"Oh, come on!"
01:27:50.891,01:27:52.976,"What choice do we have, Zimsky?"
01:27:53.018,01:27:57.814,"If they set that thing off, the shock waves will wipe us out!"
01:27:57.856,01:28:05.739,"Virgil, I'm telling you right now, we will fire Destiny, and we need to do so as quickly as possible, and if you're still there, you will be destroyed."
01:28:06.573,01:28:08.533,Rebecca?
01:28:08.575,01:28:09.826,Please don't make me have to do this.
01:28:16.250,01:28:17.251,Plan C.
01:28:20.963,01:28:22.672,"It's your call, Commander."
01:28:28.303,01:28:29.721,Majority decision.
01:28:30.680,01:28:31.974,We're going in.
01:28:33.391,01:28:34.684,"I'm sorry, sir."
01:28:37.896,01:28:39.522,"Oh, come on, you're a bunch of suicidal morons!"
01:28:39.564,01:28:41.191,"What are you, crazy?"
01:28:41.233,01:28:44.945,Plan C?
01:28:44.987,01:28:46.696,That's a brilliant idea!
01:28:46.738,01:28:48.949,I can't believe I'm stuck in this floating septic tank with you lunatics!
01:28:48.991,01:28:50.784,You may have nothing to lose.
01:28:50.826,01:28:52.869,You may have nothing to lose!
01:28:50.826,01:28:55.371,"You may have nothing to lose but I have my life to lose, thank you very much while you're up!"
01:28:55.413,01:28:57.916,Now turn it around!
01:28:57.958,01:28:59.709,Why? You want to be a hero?
01:28:59.751,01:29:01.128,What do you want to be?
01:29:01.170,01:29:02.378,Thank you!
01:29:02.420,01:29:03.797,No!
01:29:09.011,01:29:10.304,"You, shut up!"
01:29:17.060,01:29:18.645,It's not a stupid ship.
01:29:20.438,01:29:21.523,I had to.
01:29:25.694,01:29:26.862,It had to happen sometime.
01:29:26.903,01:29:27.863,Yeah.
01:29:34.161,01:29:35.912,Oh...
01:29:35.954,01:29:37.413,Status. What is that?
01:29:37.455,01:29:39.208,RAT: It's the EM monitoring station.
01:29:39.249,01:29:40.750,It's the one that tracks EM pulses.
01:29:41.668,01:29:42.711,"God, no."
01:29:47.049,01:29:48.466,"Just talk, Mr. Rat."
01:29:48.508,01:29:50.760,No.
01:29:50.802,01:29:54.681,Remember those invisible microwaves that Josh was talking about?
01:29:55.724,01:29:57.517,"Well, they just found a hole."
01:30:38.141,01:30:39.809,"No, it's a parking lot out here..."
01:30:54.408,01:30:56.159,"Oh, my God."
01:31:30.152,01:31:36.616,"WOMAN: And now with this we go live to San Francisco, where Leo Jacks has the story."
01:31:36.658,01:31:45.625,"JACKS: Yes, Claire, it's hard to believe that half of San Francisco is in ruins today following the most devastating and the most baffling event in our nation's history."
01:31:45.667,01:31:48.586,"Uh, it's-it's a horrific situation here."
01:31:48.628,01:31:51.131,Thousands are dead.
01:31:51.173,01:31:53.258,"It's-it's hotels, hospitals."
01:31:53.300,01:31:54.968,Bring up the power grid.
01:31:57.387,01:31:59.306,The whole west coast is out.
01:32:01.766,01:32:07.481,That means we're going to have to suck up just about every drop of juice east of the Rockies to fire Destiny.
01:32:07.521,01:32:09.983,"Another EM spike, we're not going to have enough power."
01:32:11.901,01:32:13.987,"General, you have got to give them more time."
01:32:14.029,01:32:14.946,PURCELL: There is no more time.
01:32:15.864,01:32:18.074,"Colonel, call Destiny."
01:32:18.116,01:32:20.660,I am launching a formal complaint against you with the Department of Defense.
01:32:20.702,01:32:22.120,Rat to Josh.
01:32:22.162,01:32:24.456,"Go, Rat."
01:32:24.498,01:32:26.749,Here's the EM field data that you're primed for.
01:32:27.876,01:32:29.627,"Digging that, Rat."
01:32:29.669,01:32:30.837,Primed for.
01:32:31.338,01:32:32.630,Primed for.
01:32:32.672,01:32:38.970,"Prime numbers-- one, two, three, five, seven, 11, 13, 17..."
01:33:03.912,01:33:05.038,Here we go.
01:33:28.019,01:33:29.062,James.
01:33:36.570,01:33:37.695,"Yes, sir."
01:33:40.449,01:33:41.908,"Yes, sir."
01:33:41.950,01:33:43.743,"Here we go, folks."
01:33:43.785,01:33:45.745,"JOSH: Okay, this time it's going to work."
01:33:45.787,01:33:47.247,Here you go... Beautiful.
01:33:48.748,01:33:51.293,"Come on, daddy wants to see the sky again."
01:33:55.046,01:33:57.966,"Okay, okay, okay."
01:33:58.007,01:33:59.301,"Your torque is R, cross F..."
01:33:59.342,01:34:01.428,"No, your R is too small, Josh."
01:34:01.470,01:34:03.430,Right.
01:34:04.347,01:34:06.057,What are you laughing at?
01:34:06.099,01:34:11.229,"No, I mean, it took me and 400 of the world's smartest people to come up with the first plan."
01:34:11.271,01:34:13.523,No. I want to turn around and go home.
01:34:13.565,01:34:15.609,It's not going to happen.
01:34:15.649,01:34:17.569,"Well, then we're going to die."
01:34:18.612,01:34:20.322,True.
01:34:18.612,01:34:22.824,"All right, look, let's start from square one."
01:34:22.865,01:34:27.870,The bulk modules-- depends on density.
01:34:22.865,01:34:31.500,"Your torque is R cross F, but you have to integrate volume..."
01:34:31.541,01:34:34.419,"BRAZZLETON: But here, here..."
01:34:38.465,01:34:39.882,"Now, we got this..."
01:34:39.924,01:34:43.303,"Okay, now, R cross F, we're putting put in pi. What's V?"
01:34:45.054,01:34:46.806,"Oh, for God's sake!"
01:34:46.848,01:34:48.057,All right.
01:34:48.099,01:34:49.518,"ZIMSKY: No, no, no!"
01:34:49.559,01:34:50.644,"Braz, no, look, I have a theory."
01:34:51.936,01:34:53.188,Are you interested?
01:34:53.229,01:34:55.482,Yes. We're interested.
01:34:55.524,01:34:57.150,"Then let me smoke a cigarette, and I'll tell you."
01:35:07.369,01:35:09.412,"Oh, thank God."
01:35:09.454,01:35:11.373,"Hmm? All right, fine, look."
01:35:11.414,01:35:14.042,"Look, we have to use wave interference, okay?"
01:35:14.083,01:35:15.877,Because one explosion won't do it.
01:35:15.918,01:35:17.462,Think about stones in a pond.
01:35:17.504,01:35:21.799,"You drop a large stone into a pond, you get a big splash, and then that's it, it's over."
01:35:21.841,01:35:31.893,"But drop a smaller stone, wait until the ripples weaken and drop another and another, and another, and fluid dynamics 101."
01:35:31.934,01:35:35.271,The ripples reinforce each other in geometric progression.
01:35:35.313,01:35:36.898,"BRAZZLETON: Hm, the whole bigger than the sum of the parts."
01:35:36.939,01:35:39.984,Then we'll have five 200 megaton explosions...
01:35:40.026,01:35:41.777,Instead of one big bang.
01:35:41.819,01:35:44.531,"JOSH: So, we hot-wire the nukes."
01:35:44.573,01:35:45.532,Yes.
01:35:46.658,01:35:47.950,We seed them through the core...
01:35:47.992,01:35:49.244,At locations that have to be accurate to the inch.
01:35:50.828,01:35:57.835,We detonate them in a sequence that has to be accurate then we outrun the biggest nuclear shock wave in history.
01:35:59.379,01:36:00.422,Right.
01:36:00.880,01:36:03.007,Yeah.
01:36:03.049,01:36:04.426,"I mean, that should be fairly simple."
01:36:12.850,01:36:16.020,Destiny now should be diverting to the central.
01:36:16.062,01:36:17.897,Final calibration on both transmission systems...
01:36:25.697,01:36:26.864,Come on.
01:36:26.906,01:36:28.324,JOSH: Cut the...
01:36:28.366,01:36:29.618,The red wire above the circuit.
01:36:30.410,01:36:31.785,Okay. Okay.
01:36:31.827,01:36:33.455,"No, no, wait, hold it!"
01:36:38.585,01:36:39.711,Please...
01:36:44.966,01:36:46.551,"Extensions A, B."
01:36:46.593,01:36:49.178,Here we go.
01:36:49.220,01:36:51.180,Increase power to reactors ten through 15.
01:37:44.900,01:37:47.278,"BECK: Okay, guys we're closing on the inner core."
01:37:47.320,01:37:48.321,JOSH: The nukes are ready.
01:37:50.198,01:37:52.074,Great.
01:37:52.116,01:37:54.536,No. The bombs are not built for these pressures.
01:37:54.577,01:37:56.705,That's why they were in that pod.
01:37:56.746,01:37:58.581,If you send them out now...
01:37:58.623,01:38:00.458,I'm assuming we have a plan D.
01:38:00.500,01:38:03.336,Plan D is Virgil's compartments.
01:38:00.500,01:38:06.172,"We put a nuke in each section of Virgil, and then eject the individual sections one at a time."
01:38:06.214,01:38:08.466,They should stay intact long enough for the nuke to go off.
01:38:08.508,01:38:12.345,Oh...
01:38:12.387,01:38:15.682,Virgil's not designed to eject undamaged compartments.
01:38:15.724,01:38:18.852,"Okay, these are the ejection mechanisms holding each compartment in place."
01:38:20.687,01:38:22.856,They're all connected by one master hydraulic gear.
01:38:24.482,01:38:26.442,Kind of like keys on a key ring.
01:38:26.484,01:38:28.944,"What we have to do, we have to unlock the piston."
01:38:28.986,01:38:31.947,That will release the compartments so the bombs can be jettisoned.
01:38:31.989,01:38:34.576,Where's the master gear?
01:38:34.617,01:38:36.910,In the crawl space we used to get out earlier.
01:38:36.952,01:38:38.371,"Well, what the hell is it doing there?"
01:38:38.413,01:38:40.164,I built the ship in three damn months.
01:38:40.206,01:38:42.958,I didn't think I'd be intentionally sabotaging it.
01:38:43.000,01:38:45.086,So one of us has to go in there.
01:38:45.127,01:38:48.590,"Into the crawl space that has core fluid at 9,000 degrees."
01:38:48.631,01:38:50.049,Can you flush it with liquid nitrogen?
01:38:50.091,01:38:52.093,We don't have enough at this point.
01:38:52.134,01:38:54.303,"9,000 degrees."
01:38:55.096,01:38:56.431,"Half that, probably."
01:38:56.472,01:38:58.140,Right. Half that.
01:38:58.182,01:38:59.642,"Whoever goes into that crawl space, is not coming back."
01:39:03.563,01:39:04.564,Hmm.
01:39:11.279,01:39:13.030,Together.
01:39:13.865,01:39:15.074,Wait.
01:39:15.116,01:39:16.534,On three.
01:39:16.576,01:39:19.412,One... Two... Three.
01:39:29.213,01:39:30.131,Huh.
01:39:32.300,01:39:35.637,"Well, I better go on, get myself ready."
01:39:37.764,01:39:39.849,"No, Braz, wait."
01:39:39.891,01:39:41.434,"No, Braz, no wait."
01:39:41.476,01:39:42.518,No.
01:39:42.560,01:39:43.728,May I?
01:39:43.770,01:39:44.729,Yes.
01:39:46.230,01:39:47.273,Magic.
01:39:48.608,01:39:52.361,"I mean, Braz, three straws of equal length."
01:39:53.947,01:39:56.198,"I mean, this is childish."
01:39:56.240,01:39:57.366,"No, we will not do it again."
01:39:58.952,01:40:00.703,I thought you'd be happy.
01:40:00.745,01:40:03.372,No. Not at the expense of you making us look like fools.
01:40:03.414,01:40:04.791,He's right. Why do you get dibs on being the hero?
01:40:04.833,01:40:06.417,Because it's my damn ship.
01:40:06.459,01:40:08.169,"Oh, that makes perfect sense."
01:40:06.459,01:40:11.339,"Look, for 20 years, I've done nothing but Virgil. 20 years."
01:40:11.380,01:40:14.300,"Virgil belongs to me, and I will not let her fail."
01:40:17.386,01:40:20.013,Now if you want to know what's worth dying for-- this ship.
01:40:20.055,01:40:22.141,Building it instead of imagining it.
01:40:23.768,01:40:26.228,"If Virgil needs more blood, it will be my blood."
01:40:28.314,01:40:30.232,Now I am going to go and get ready.
01:40:42.119,01:40:43.287,Good to go.
01:40:48.501,01:40:49.502,Beck.
01:40:50.920,01:40:51.880,Josh.
01:40:54.841,01:40:56.133,"It's a hell of a boat you built, Braz."
01:40:57.468,01:41:00.596,I am really proud to have known you guys.
01:41:02.015,01:41:02.932,JOSH: Thank you.
01:41:24.328,01:41:25.287,Braz.
01:41:25.747,01:41:26.789,Edward.
01:41:29.584,01:41:31.377,"Yes, Conrad?"
01:41:31.920,01:41:33.588,You're right.
01:41:33.629,01:41:35.006,It is your ship.
01:41:37.299,01:41:38.676,But I wish to God it had been ours.
01:42:02.784,01:42:04.452,"The chamber's sealed, Beck."
01:42:05.202,01:42:06.245,Ready.
01:42:10.499,01:42:12.043,Open the hatch.
01:42:50.706,01:42:52.000,"Hang on, Braz."
01:42:53.166,01:42:54.585,"Come on, hang on."
01:43:48.681,01:43:50.265,Manual override is complete!
01:43:50.307,01:43:51.559,"Braz, we can still get you out of there."
01:43:54.603,01:43:58.440,No... Start...
01:44:01.944,01:44:02.862,No.
01:44:31.724,01:44:33.392,We got a job to do.
01:44:33.434,01:44:34.643,Let's do it.
01:44:35.477,01:44:36.562,Let's go.
01:44:39.023,01:44:40.649,Magnetic shielding systems are up.
01:44:40.691,01:44:42.610,Power level's 85%.
01:44:42.651,01:44:44.987,Increase power to reactor 10.
01:44:45.029,01:44:46.864,All personnel should be clear.
01:45:02.171,01:45:03.296,"ZIMSKY: Oh, God!"
01:45:03.338,01:45:04.632,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:45:10.012,01:45:12.098,"Okay, she's down."
01:45:12.140,01:45:14.475,BECK: Approaching the first drop-off point.
01:45:14.516,01:45:15.726,"We got to be accurate to the second here, boys."
01:45:17.728,01:45:20.064,And drop in three-five seconds.
01:45:20.106,01:45:22.315,And... Timer on.
01:45:23.358,01:45:24.485,Pull it.
01:45:29.448,01:45:31.742,Clear... And...
01:45:31.784,01:45:32.868,Ejecting.
01:45:40.333,01:45:42.003,All right.
01:45:42.044,01:45:43.296,Sir...
01:45:43.336,01:45:45.047,"It's our last shot, Stick."
01:45:46.966,01:45:48.050,Damn you.
01:45:48.092,01:45:49.551,Damn me? Too late.
01:45:50.552,01:45:52.763,"JAMES: Ten, nine, eight..."
01:45:55.224,01:45:56.433,What's that?
01:46:01.147,01:46:02.773,Gotcha!
01:46:02.815,01:46:05.193,"...Four, three, two..."
01:46:06.068,01:46:07.528,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
01:46:07.569,01:46:08.821,Someone's diverted our energy.
01:46:08.863,01:46:10.323,Where the hell's it gone?!
01:46:10.363,01:46:11.699,It looks like...
01:46:14.160,01:46:15.161,Coney Island.
01:46:17.705,01:46:20.582,Your kung fu is not strong.
01:46:20.624,01:46:22.335,"Well, how long will it take to get it back online?"
01:46:23.544,01:46:25.046,"Well, then get to it!"
01:46:33.637,01:46:35.639,"Oh, hey, General."
01:46:35.681,01:46:37.808,Is there something I can do for you?
01:46:41.687,01:46:42.813,Timer on.
01:46:45.107,01:46:46.317,Clear...
01:46:46.359,01:46:47.526,Ejecting.
01:46:54.491,01:46:55.576,Ejecting.
01:46:58.913,01:46:59.997,Pull it.
01:47:02.791,01:47:04.960,Let's go throw our last little 200 megaton stone in the pond.
01:47:06.461,01:47:08.505,I always wanted to make a splash in nuclear physics.
01:47:08.547,01:47:10.674,"You know, that energy propagation stuff you were talking about..."
01:47:10.716,01:47:12.176,That was high school physics.
01:47:12.218,01:47:13.886,I just took the wavelengths of the core fluid off the MRI readings.
01:47:13.928,01:47:17.223,"Yeah, and multiplied by 800..."
01:47:17.265,01:47:19.600,Surely you compensated for the MRI bias.
01:47:22.061,01:47:24.063,We got to reset the timers!
01:47:25.564,01:47:27.400,It's not the timers!
01:47:27.440,01:47:28.525,It's not the timers!
01:47:28.567,01:47:29.777,What's not enough?
01:47:29.818,01:47:31.237,The last bomb is not enough.
01:47:31.279,01:47:32.696,To complete the wave form.
01:47:32.738,01:47:35.199,Yeah. No. The last bomb has to be 30% larger.
01:47:35.241,01:47:37.076,That's six or seven pounds of plutonium.
01:47:37.118,01:47:38.244,Where are we going to get six or seven pounds of plutonium?
01:47:47.544,01:47:50.339,"Guys, we got hit by an energy flare."
01:47:50.381,01:47:52.049,Ejecting compartment in 50 seconds.
01:47:52.091,01:47:54.218,"No, Beck! No, wait!"
01:47:54.260,01:47:56.137,You push it!
01:47:56.178,01:47:57.388,"Come on, guys, I can't hear you."
01:48:00.015,01:48:01.850,It's got my shoulder!
01:48:01.892,01:48:03.852,Guys!
01:48:03.894,01:48:06.939,Clear the compartment!
01:48:06.981,01:48:08.274,I think the flare has knocked the coms out.
01:48:08.316,01:48:09.482,"I can't get it, Josh."
01:48:09.524,01:48:10.483,Go...
01:48:11.484,01:48:12.569,I can't.
01:48:12.611,01:48:13.821,Okay.
01:48:13.862,01:48:16.240,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:48:16.282,01:48:18.242,Can you hear me?
01:48:18.284,01:48:19.785,I'm correcting course.
01:48:26.417,01:48:27.460,Zimsky!
01:48:28.169,01:48:29.462,No!
01:48:35.343,01:48:36.551,Push it!
01:48:38.304,01:48:40.264,Ejecting compartment in ten seconds.
01:48:40.306,01:48:41.390,Can you hear me?
01:48:41.432,01:48:42.933,"Josh, go! Go! Go!"
01:48:43.642,01:48:45.644,Get out! Get out!
01:48:45.686,01:48:46.770,Now! Get out!
01:49:00.326,01:49:02.328,ZIMSKY: Josh.
01:49:02.370,01:49:04.788,"For the last bomb, to make it larger..."
01:49:06.207,01:49:07.666,Use the fuel rods from the react...
01:49:10.878,01:49:11.670,BECK: Ejecting.
01:49:17.592,01:49:18.927,I got to get...
01:49:18.969,01:49:20.221,I got to...
01:49:21.180,01:49:22.181,Beck.
01:49:25.558,01:49:27.520,"Beck, can you hear me?"
01:49:27.560,01:49:30.231,"Beck, if you have any better ideas, you tell me now."
01:49:30.272,01:49:31.773,We've only have three minutes to eject this one.
01:49:31.815,01:49:32.774,Beck!
01:49:35.319,01:49:36.362,"Come on, guys."
01:49:39.240,01:49:40.199,Beck.
01:51:26.597,01:51:28.307,"Josh, come on."
01:51:30.934,01:51:32.186,Are you okay?
01:51:34.687,01:51:36.649,Are you okay?
01:51:36.689,01:51:38.526,Will you take my gloves off?
01:51:39.485,01:51:40.569,Please.
01:51:42.655,01:51:44.323,I had to build the blast.
01:51:45.407,01:51:47.201,I'm sorry.
01:51:47.242,01:51:48.994,No. Stay here for one second.
01:51:50.287,01:51:52.080,I was trying to call you.
01:51:53.040,01:51:54.749,I know the coms were down.
01:51:55.167,01:51:56.251,Right.
01:51:57.127,01:51:58.879,I know what you did.
01:51:58.920,01:52:00.088,We don't have enough energy...
01:52:00.130,01:52:01.549,I know.
01:52:01.590,01:52:02.883,...To get back.
01:52:02.924,01:52:04.552,You did good.
01:52:04.593,01:52:05.718,I would've done the same thing.
01:52:08.096,01:52:09.431,Where's Zimsky?
01:52:12.685,01:52:13.852,Come here.
01:52:15.312,01:52:16.564,You did good.
01:52:19.732,01:52:20.984,You did good.
01:52:34.456,01:52:36.749,One minute to the first detonation.
01:52:36.791,01:52:38.544,And 12 until the blast hits us.
01:52:44.592,01:52:46.051,I was hoping we'd suffocate to death first.
01:53:21.712,01:53:22.713,Beck.
01:53:24.506,01:53:25.674,"Beck, Beck."
01:53:28.051,01:53:31.346,If I got you enough power to fire the impeller?
01:53:31.388,01:53:32.598,Maybe not the laser but the impeller.
01:53:32.640,01:53:33.848,What? From where?
01:53:33.890,01:53:35.350,The heat of the core.
01:53:35.392,01:53:37.269,"It's 9,000 degrees."
01:53:37.311,01:53:40.188,Unobtanium converts heat to energy.
01:53:40.230,01:53:41.774,So this whole damn ship is like a big old solar panel.
01:53:43.525,01:53:44.817,"Come on, I need your help."
01:53:52.493,01:53:54.328,Number two's going!
01:53:54.369,01:53:55.912,"Come on, come on."
01:54:13.388,01:54:16.767,For here in the great infinite unknowable...
01:54:18.185,01:54:23.482,Man can come to know the most important thing of all: Himself.
01:54:25.275,01:54:26.777,He can understand...
01:54:29.738,01:54:31.406,What the fuck am I doing?
01:55:09.027,01:55:10.278,We've got full rotation!
01:55:10.320,01:55:11.780,It's turning!
01:55:20.539,01:55:21.749,All right!
01:55:31.258,01:55:32.509,"Come on, Beck, where is it?"
01:55:34.344,01:55:35.846,Come on.
01:55:37.431,01:55:39.099,Is that the last one?- Yeah.
01:55:47.399,01:55:48.567,Give it a couple of seconds.
01:55:58.911,01:56:00.245,It worked!
01:56:13.884,01:56:15.218,Get ready to pull a few G's.
01:56:34.154,01:56:35.906,420 knots.
01:56:35.948,01:56:37.031,"Now, this is more like it."
01:56:37.073,01:56:38.032,440.
01:56:45.707,01:56:48.794,"So, Rat, what's the center of this quake?"
01:56:48.836,01:56:51.254,It's everywhere!
01:56:51.296,01:56:52.380,The planet's healing itself.
01:56:56.092,01:56:57.678,"At this speed, we're going to be home in a third of the time."
01:57:30.711,01:57:33.171,"As long as we can surf these magma flows, we'll be okay."
01:57:33.213,01:57:37.009,"Let's just pray we don't run into any dead ends, or we're going to miss those lasers."
01:57:40.136,01:57:43.724,"Okay, navigator, which way?"
01:57:43.765,01:57:45.475,We've got greater fluid density on the left.
01:57:45.517,01:57:46.768,Go with the flow.
01:57:46.810,01:57:47.853,Uh-huh.
01:58:09.123,01:58:11.043,"Bill, where are they headed?"
01:58:11.084,01:58:14.295,Looks like she found a space between some tectonic plates somewhere near Hawaii.
01:58:21.302,01:58:22.804,Josh...
01:58:22.846,01:58:24.014,They're closing in on us too fast.
01:58:24.056,01:58:25.682,I don't know if I can...
01:58:42.240,01:58:45.285,"Um... W-we lost them, Stick, and I..."
01:59:08.892,01:59:10.393,Where'd our power go?
01:59:11.269,01:59:13.021,"Well, we're powered by the heat."
01:59:14.439,01:59:15.649,It's stone cold down here.
01:59:18.526,01:59:19.569,Well...
01:59:20.737,01:59:21.696,Look on the bright side.
01:59:24.365,01:59:26.660,At least we're not going to boil to death.
01:59:26.701,01:59:28.620,You always look on the bright side?
01:59:31.748,01:59:41.549,"Okay, let's assess: We've got no communications, we're probably 800 feet down, but we might as well be 800 miles."
01:59:43.593,01:59:48.556,We're in an unobtanium cigar tube with the sonar signature of a rock.
01:59:48.598,01:59:55.271,"We've got just enough power to make the ultrasonics burp, but no one's listening on those frequencies anyway, and..."
01:59:55.313,01:59:57.565,Nobody even knows we're alive.
02:00:03.279,02:00:04.238,Okay.
02:00:05.573,02:00:06.825,Give me a minute on this one.
02:00:24.300,02:00:26.302,PURCELL: This is hopeless.
02:00:26.344,02:00:28.638,"Come on, General, we've got to be getting close."
02:00:28.680,02:00:32.266,"Mr. Rat, even if they were still alive, there's no way they could contact us."
02:00:36.479,02:00:38.690,"Skipper, combat relays that our sub has something on the sonar."
02:00:38.732,02:00:39.774,Where do they think?
02:00:46.073,02:00:48.200,"Whales, sir."
02:00:48.241,02:00:51.369,"They're a long way off their usual path, but that's not uncommon since that, uh..."
02:00:51.411,02:00:53.205,What are they calling it?
02:00:53.246,02:00:55.707,"Yeah, that's what they call it."
02:00:55.749,02:00:59.669,"Well, thank you very much, Captain, but I think we're done here."
02:00:59.711,02:01:00.754,General.
02:01:04.507,02:01:06.342,"J.O., this is the captain."
02:01:06.384,02:01:08.011,Stand down from SAR operations.
02:01:40.127,02:01:42.754,It's whales! It's whales!
02:01:42.796,02:01:45.257,Hey! General!
02:01:45.298,02:01:46.674,Stick!
02:01:46.716,02:01:48.051,It's whales!
02:01:48.093,02:01:49.761,The ultrasonics!
02:01:49.803,02:01:51.554,They're singing to them!
02:01:51.596,02:01:53.098,You gotta find the whales!
02:02:12.242,02:02:14.494,"Alpha X-ray, this is November Echo Six One Zero."
02:02:16.288,02:02:17.914,"Hold on, I'm seeing those whales now."
02:02:17.956,02:02:19.791,Hold on!
02:02:19.833,02:02:22.210,"Okay, ball's in the water."
02:02:22.252,02:02:25.130,This is neat. Those whales are circling something.
02:02:25.172,02:02:26.673,We have a strong echo here.
02:02:26.714,02:02:28.842,"Depth, 800 feet."
02:02:28.883,02:02:30.677,There-there's something down there. There's definitely something down there.
02:03:14.971,02:03:16.514,I told you pulsing the ultrasonics would work.
02:03:17.807,02:03:19.100,Do you ever get tired of being right?
02:03:20.643,02:03:21.602,Yes.
02:03:23.646,02:03:25.273,So what's next for you?
02:03:26.107,02:03:27.400,A shower.
02:03:29.194,02:03:31.029,"Then back to NASA, I guess."
02:03:32.572,02:03:34.532,You?
02:03:34.574,02:03:41.915,"Deep-dish pepperoni pizza, green peppers, onions, extra mushrooms-- then a shower and then back to the classroom."
02:03:44.292,02:03:45.710,"NASA could use a few good men, you know."
02:03:50.840,02:03:53.134,"Unfortunately, so could my freshmen geophysics students."
02:03:58.723,02:04:01.393,"You know what makes me really, really angry?"
02:04:03.353,02:04:06.981,"Bob, Serge, Braz, Zimsky..."
02:04:07.023,02:04:08.775,No one's going to ever know what they did or why they died.
02:04:12.070,02:04:13.154,Unless...
02:04:15.365,02:04:16.908,It all got out somehow.
02:04:20.036,02:04:21.454,That's unthinkable.
02:04:22.872,02:04:23.831,Yeah.
02:04:59.867,02:05:01.369,"Okay, here we go."
02:05:10.920,02:05:12.130,Sweet.
02:05:26.144,02:05:33.651,"It is now emerging that the world owes its survival to the heroism of six remarkable individuals-- shuttle commander Robert Iverson,..."
02:05:33.693,02:05:35.695,This extraordinary craft...
02:05:35.736,02:05:38.072,"French scientist, Dr. Serge..."
02:05:38.114,02:05:39.573,...Was captained by NASA astronaut Dr. Bob Iverson.
02:05:39.615,02:05:41.201,Edward Brazzleton is a name so...
02:05:41.242,02:05:42.952,...Dr. Conrad Zimsky will be best remembered...
02:05:42.994,02:05:47.499,"On Capitol Hill today, everyone's asking the same question-- What is Project Destiny?"
02:05:51.627,02:05:53.129,"Destiny, meet world."
02:05:53.963,02:05:56.049,"World, meet Destiny."
02:05:58.009,02:05:59.844,"Dr. Brazzleton, Dr. Zimsky..."
02:07:07.787,02:08:35.041,The moment The moment.
