00:01:25.460,00:01:27.421,"Now, you wanna know how to win a sword fight?"
00:01:27.462,00:01:28.672,How?
00:01:28.714,00:01:30.925,Be the only one with a sword.
00:01:34.135,00:01:35.094,Easy.
00:01:40.726,00:01:43.102,Give him a hand!
00:01:45.731,00:01:47.357,"Well done, John."
00:01:50.318,00:01:53.488,"Winner takes all, my friends!"
00:01:53.530,00:01:55.407,One more challenger and I'll be on my way.
00:01:55.449,00:01:56.825,Come on.
00:01:56.867,00:02:03.164,"Once in a lifetime, there comes a fighter so powerful, so fast, so fearless, that no man can touch him."
00:02:05.333,00:02:07.795,"And while you're waiting for him to come along, you can practice on me."
00:02:10.965,00:02:12.132,You can take him on.
00:02:14.468,00:02:19.723,"As sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, somewhere, there's a man who's better than me."
00:02:21.100,00:02:23.685,Could be here.
00:02:23.727,00:02:24.770,Go on.
00:02:24.812,00:02:26.105,Yes!
00:02:29.190,00:02:30.358,It could be you.
00:02:32.987,00:02:34.905,He looks strong. Hmm.
00:02:34.947,00:02:35.823,Is he good?
00:02:41.620,00:02:43.956,"Go on, Mark."
00:02:45.707,00:02:47.001,"So you're Mark, are you?"
00:02:47.042,00:02:48.043,That's my name.
00:02:48.710,00:02:50.169,I'm Lancelot.
00:02:51.421,00:02:52.506,You ready?
00:02:54.257,00:02:55.425,Ready.
00:03:07.354,00:03:10.149,"to kill me to win, you know."
00:03:15.487,00:03:18.365,Right. Got tight hold of your sword?
00:03:18.406,00:03:20.701,Don't you worry about that! Ah!
00:03:20.742,00:03:22.786,"Good, now, can I give you some advice?"
00:03:22.828,00:03:23.912,What's that?
00:03:23.954,00:03:25.580,Don't drop your sword.
00:03:36.216,00:03:38.927,Is this your sword?
00:03:38.969,00:03:40.595,Give him a hand!
00:03:43.015,00:03:44.058,How did you do that?
00:03:45.225,00:03:46.434,How did he do that?
00:03:46.476,00:03:48.020,you fought a good fight.
00:03:48.062,00:03:50.438,Was that a trick?
00:03:50.480,00:03:53.025,No. No trick.
00:03:53.067,00:03:54.651,Could I do it?
00:03:55.402,00:03:57.237,Tell me. I can learn.
00:04:03.785,00:04:08.331,"You have to study your opponent, how he moves, so you know what he's gonna do before he does it."
00:04:08.373,00:04:09.416,I can do that.
00:04:09.457,00:04:10.709,Mmm-hmm.
00:04:10.751,00:04:16.339,"You have to know that one moment in every fight when you win or lose, and you have to know how to wait for it."
00:04:16.381,00:04:17.257,I can do that.
00:04:18.550,00:04:21.136,And you have to not care whether you live or die.
00:05:44.303,00:05:46.847,Go on now! Quickly!
00:05:49.808,00:05:51.310,Quickly! Quickly!
00:05:51.350,00:05:53.687,Come on! Come on! Get in!
00:05:53.728,00:05:56.273,Get to the back!
00:06:06.449,00:06:09.577,Shut the doors!
00:06:13.581,00:06:14.749,Faster!
00:07:04.299,00:07:05.842,Burn it down.
00:07:16.603,00:07:18.479,We'll be burned alive!
00:07:20.481,00:07:23.318,We need water! Get water!
00:07:46.258,00:07:48.093,"No, don't open the doors!"
00:07:48.135,00:07:49.803,We'll all be dead by then!
00:08:04.025,00:08:05.485,Malagant.
00:08:18.623,00:08:25.964,"Last night, men from this village crossed the border and killed three of my people."
00:08:26.006,00:08:30.551,"In reprisal, I have destroyed your village."
00:08:30.593,00:08:33.305,The borderlands have been lawless long enough!
00:08:33.347,00:08:38.143,Know now that I am the law!
00:08:43.982,00:08:46.693,Get up!
00:08:52.324,00:08:53.700,Quickly now!
00:09:41.122,00:09:42.374,Come on!
00:09:52.551,00:09:54.511,Go on! Take it out!
00:09:59.933,00:10:01.184,"Oh, there she is."
00:10:06.231,00:10:08.400,Go on! Mind the dog!
00:10:15.907,00:10:17.409,"Here, milady. Come here."
00:10:17.451,00:10:19.994,"Wait, one moment, one moment."
00:10:20.036,00:10:21.746,Run with it!
00:10:29.129,00:10:30.589,Milady.
00:10:30.630,00:10:32.549,I know. I know.
00:10:32.591,00:10:34.717,"There's been another attack, milady."
00:10:34.759,00:10:37.011,Another border village burned.
00:10:38.430,00:10:39.806,"Ann, take my place."
00:10:39.847,00:10:40.723,Milady.
00:10:40.765,00:10:41.682,"Thank you, Jacob."
00:10:42.434,00:10:43.643,Is it Malagant again?
00:10:43.684,00:10:44.811,"Yes, milady."
00:10:44.852,00:10:47.021,A small group got away.
00:10:47.063,00:10:48.189,Are they being looked after?
00:10:48.231,00:10:50.150,"They want to see you first, milady."
00:10:59.033,00:11:01.453,"No, no, no. Please."
00:11:01.495,00:11:02.579,"Please, my poor people."
00:11:02.621,00:11:05.582,After such a terrible journey... Please.
00:11:05.624,00:11:07.708,"We didn't know where else to turn, milady."
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.419,Our homes are gone.
00:11:09.461,00:11:11.921,They've destroyed everything.
00:11:11.963,00:11:13.756,They say we crossed the border.
00:11:13.798,00:11:15.674,"Milady, we don't dare cross the border."
00:11:15.716,00:11:18.637,I know. I know.
00:11:18.677,00:11:20.679,He means to frighten us into submission.
00:11:20.721,00:11:22.223,"Don't give in to him, milady."
00:11:22.265,00:11:24.351,"We'll fight, every last one of us."
00:11:24.392,00:11:27.562,Don't worry. I'm not the yielding kind.
00:11:27.604,00:11:29.981,-Jacob.
00:11:30.023,00:11:32.108,Take these good people in and give them food and drink.
00:11:32.150,00:11:33.193,Right.
00:11:33.234,00:11:38.365,"This evening, when you've rested, we shall all pray together for your village and for Leonesse."
00:11:38.406,00:11:40.325,"God keep you safe, milady."
00:11:40.367,00:11:42.494,And you. Now go.
00:11:47.040,00:11:49.708,This is the third border village he's burned in a week.
00:11:49.750,00:11:53.672,What is it he wants?
00:11:53.712,00:11:56.132,He wants us to sign his treaty.
00:11:56.174,00:11:59.135,He thinks because my father's dead that no one will stand up to him.
00:11:59.177,00:12:01.388,"Milady, even if your father were alive..."
00:12:01.429,00:12:06.851,"If Prince Malagant doesn't get what he asks, he has the power to take it."
00:12:10.813,00:12:15.485,"Well, Oswald, you say nothing."
00:12:15.527,00:12:17.487,"You know what I think, child."
00:12:19.030,00:12:20.990,"Yes, I suppose I do."
00:12:21.032,00:12:23.535,"Prince Malagant must be answered, milady."
00:12:23.577,00:12:25.161,He will be.
00:12:25.203,00:12:27.664,I shall decide today.
00:12:27.706,00:12:30.667,"Now, leave me."
00:12:35.547,00:12:38.174,It's all come so quickly.
00:12:38.216,00:12:40.759,How much time does it take to know your own heart?
00:12:40.801,00:12:43.137,"Oh, I know what I want."
00:12:43.179,00:12:46.725,"I want to marry, and I want to live and die in Leonesse."
00:12:48.268,00:12:50.562,"But I can't have everything I want, can I?"
00:12:52.146,00:12:57.277,"Forgive me, child, but an offer of marriage from Arthur of Camelot..."
00:12:58.570,00:12:59.987,"Yes, well..."
00:13:00.821,00:13:02.907,"You're right, of course."
00:13:04.284,00:13:05.993,"So, no more words."
00:13:07.662,00:13:08.996,Let it be done.
00:13:09.038,00:13:10.206,You accept the offer?
00:13:11.291,00:13:14.043,I shall marry Arthur of Camelot.
00:13:14.085,00:13:15.878,My dear child.
00:13:15.920,00:13:19.966,I was so proud to hold you in my arms at the hour of your birth.
00:13:20.007,00:13:22.469,I shall be prouder still to see you wed.
00:13:24.262,00:13:25.680,Poor Arthur.
00:13:27.390,00:13:30.226,The only dowry I bring him is a land in danger.
00:13:31.894,00:13:33.605,"But I shall love him, Oswald."
00:13:34.355,00:13:35.898,"So you should, child."
00:13:39.527,00:13:41.195,I could never marry a man without love.
00:13:41.237,00:13:43.156,I've always known that.
00:13:44.449,00:13:50.913,"Arthur wears his power so lightly, has such gentleness in his eyes."
00:13:52.039,00:13:54.793,"I've never known anyone like him, Oswald."
00:13:55.794,00:13:57.962,How could I love anyone more?
00:15:28.261,00:15:29.846,Halt!
00:15:32.766,00:15:33.850,Whoa!
00:15:33.892,00:15:35.976,Could be an ambush.
00:15:36.018,00:15:37.270,Look to the trees!
00:15:38.855,00:15:40.481,Two lines.
00:15:40.523,00:15:41.816,Knights to positions.
00:15:41.858,00:15:43.526,"Both sides, form in!"
00:15:43.568,00:15:44.903,Protect the carriage!
00:15:53.578,00:15:54.621,Gap there!
00:16:08.635,00:16:10.428,Don't break the line!
00:16:26.068,00:16:28.738,Wait. Wait!
00:16:34.994,00:16:36.120,Now!
00:17:08.486,00:17:10.404,Follow! Follow!
00:17:21.165,00:17:22.542,Go! Go!
00:17:24.627,00:17:26.337,Follow!
00:17:26.379,00:17:28.673,It's all right.
00:17:34.512,00:17:35.555,They're going.
00:17:40.100,00:17:41.268,Wait!
00:17:44.355,00:17:45.648,Steady.
00:17:59.787,00:18:01.455,Watch your flank!
00:18:19.807,00:18:20.850,Oh!
00:18:43.414,00:18:45.541,We've got to jump!
00:18:45.583,00:18:47.126,"Come on, Elise."
00:18:53.758,00:18:55.927,Roll when you hit the ground!
00:19:10.566,00:19:12.318,"Petronella, come on!"
00:19:13.611,00:19:15.655,Come on. You have to!
00:19:15.696,00:19:17.115,"No, I can't!"
00:19:20.910,00:19:22.120,Hurry!
00:19:24.747,00:19:26.332,Save yourself!
00:19:26.373,00:19:27.625,I can't!
00:20:28.435,00:20:31.105,gone to ground.
00:20:32.940,00:20:35.317,"Aw, she can't be far."
00:20:46.370,00:20:47.538,There!
00:20:53.211,00:20:54.628,Don't move.
00:20:55.254,00:20:56.380,Shh.
00:20:58.216,00:20:59.299,Who are you?
00:20:59.341,00:21:00.718,Who cares?
00:21:05.347,00:21:06.640,Kill him!
00:21:32.792,00:21:34.085,Shh. Shh.
00:21:34.127,00:21:35.878,What is it?
00:21:35.920,00:21:37.421,There were three.
00:21:40.925,00:21:42.218,Don't even breathe!
00:21:42.260,00:21:44.511,"You, drop the sword."
00:21:47.932,00:21:50.059,All right.
00:21:50.101,00:21:51.769,But can I have her when you're finished with her?
00:21:52.728,00:21:54.438,You were after the woman?
00:21:54.480,00:21:56.107,Of course.
00:21:56.149,00:21:59.986,Did you ever see anything so beautiful in your whole life?
00:22:00.027,00:22:01.779,I don't know about that.
00:22:01.821,00:22:04.198,Don't tell me you don't want her.
00:22:04.240,00:22:07.285,Soft skin. Sweet lips.
00:22:07.326,00:22:08.995,"Young, firm body."
00:22:09.787,00:22:11.371,I have my orders.
00:22:11.413,00:22:13.124,So? Who's to know?
00:22:14.167,00:22:16.585,"No. No, I should take her back."
00:22:16.627,00:22:19.588,How about I hold her for you?
00:22:19.630,00:22:21.257,Won't take long.
00:22:22.675,00:22:24.260,I don't want any trouble.
00:22:24.302,00:22:27.554,No. This one's no trouble.
00:22:27.596,00:22:30.141,"She wants it, all right."
00:22:30.183,00:22:31.349,What's she doing?
00:22:31.391,00:22:33.393,See for yourself.
00:22:33.435,00:22:35.688,Turn her around.
00:22:35.729,00:22:37.857,See what she's got for you.
00:22:38.524,00:22:40.109,"Oh, pretty."
00:22:40.151,00:22:42.278,Pretty!
00:22:42.320,00:22:45.072,"Now, what have you got for me, then?"
00:23:17.771,00:23:19.023,Come on.
00:23:21.859,00:23:23.152,Let's go.
00:24:05.903,00:24:07.905,Why did you risk your life for me?
00:24:07.947,00:24:09.365,I didn't.
00:24:09.407,00:24:10.448,They could've killed you.
00:24:10.490,00:24:12.952,I'm not that easy to kill.
00:24:15.162,00:24:17.331,Do you know who I am?
00:24:17.373,00:24:18.582,Who are you?
00:24:18.624,00:24:21.335,Guinevere.
00:24:23.921,00:24:25.047,Well?
00:24:25.756,00:24:27.883,Well what?
00:24:27.925,00:24:31.220,Doesn't it please you to know you saved the life of a lady?
00:24:31.262,00:24:33.431,I'd be just as pleased if you were a dairymaid.
00:24:33.471,00:24:36.267,A dairymaid couldn't reward you as I can.
00:24:40.146,00:24:43.899,"If she was as pretty as you, she could give me all the reward I wanted."
00:24:45.901,00:24:47.653,What did I do?
00:24:47.694,00:24:49.280,Insulted me.
00:24:53.951,00:24:55.369,Now I've insulted you.
00:24:57.955,00:24:59.873,How dare you!
00:24:59.915,00:25:02.251,How dare you treat me like this!
00:25:03.461,00:25:05.921,I take it you know no better.
00:25:05.963,00:25:09.383,"You have done me a great service today, and I shall forget the matter."
00:25:11.260,00:25:12.594,Which way?
00:25:12.636,00:25:15.889,Don't know. Never been in this forest before.
00:25:15.931,00:25:18.767,Then how do you know it's leading to the road?
00:25:18.809,00:25:20.227,I'm guessing.
00:25:20.269,00:25:22.271,-Guessing?
00:25:22.980,00:25:25.149,See the scavenger birds?
00:25:25.191,00:25:26.942,There?
00:25:26.984,00:25:29.903,They're looking for small animals crushed by the passing wagons.
00:25:29.945,00:25:31.613,It's not far now.
00:25:36.243,00:25:38.037,About this reward...
00:25:38.078,00:25:41.539,My man will pay you when we find my escort.
00:25:41.581,00:25:43.250,I don't want money.
00:25:43.292,00:25:46.586,"I think you should know, I'm on my way to be married."
00:25:46.628,00:25:49.215,"Well, if you're on your way to be married, you're not married yet."
00:25:49.256,00:25:51.467,"You're not married yet, you're free."
00:25:51.509,00:25:54.094,I've given my word.
00:25:54.136,00:25:55.762,I don't want your word.
00:25:56.347,00:25:58.391,I want you.
00:25:58.432,00:26:01.435,"I'm not to be had for the wanting, sir."
00:26:01.477,00:26:03.020,Why not?
00:26:03.062,00:26:04.980,"If I want you, if you want me?"
00:26:05.022,00:26:08.484,You may find this childish arrogance impresses servant girls.
00:26:08.526,00:26:10.903,I can tell when a woman wants me.
00:26:11.695,00:26:13.697,I can see it in her eyes.
00:26:15.032,00:26:16.534,Not in my eyes.
00:26:32.550,00:26:34.760,"You're afraid, aren't you?"
00:26:34.801,00:26:36.554,I've nothing to hide.
00:26:37.221,00:26:38.847,Then look at me.
00:27:16.051,00:27:22.600,"If there is any honor in you, promise me never to do that again."
00:27:24.435,00:27:34.027,"I don't know about honor, but I promise you, I won't kiss you again till you ask me to."
00:27:34.069,00:27:35.946,And that I never will.
00:27:48.626,00:27:50.628,When do you get married?
00:27:52.379,00:27:53.964,On midsummer's day.
00:27:57.843,00:28:02.055,"Before midsummer's day dawns, you'll ask me to kiss you again."
00:28:02.097,00:28:04.682,You insult me and then you abandon me?
00:28:05.851,00:28:07.227,That's the road ahead.
00:28:09.605,00:28:12.065,"And that, I presume, is your brave escort."
00:28:12.107,00:28:13.400,Have that checked out.
00:28:35.673,00:28:39.134,My child!
00:28:40.927,00:28:42.762,Are my ladies safe?
00:28:42.804,00:28:45.140,"Were you followed, milady?"
00:28:45.182,00:28:46.266,No.
00:28:48.477,00:28:50.437,"No, there's no one there."
00:29:06.579,00:29:08.830,"Your new country awaits you, child."
00:29:12.209,00:29:14.545,If anything should happen at home...
00:29:14.587,00:29:16.505,I'll send word.
00:29:16.547,00:29:17.631,Never fear.
00:29:17.673,00:29:19.299,Send Jacob.
00:29:19.341,00:29:21.843,"But I want to know at once, good news or bad."
00:29:21.885,00:29:23.303,Promise me.
00:29:23.345,00:29:24.846,I promise you.
00:31:00.317,00:31:04.822,"Lady Guinevere of Leonesse, welcome to Camelot."
00:31:07.991,00:31:10.076,God be praised you're safe.
00:31:10.118,00:31:12.245,Nothing shall ever harm you again.
00:31:12.287,00:31:15.624,Milord honors me with his kindness.
00:31:15.666,00:31:19.586,Your coming brings me a happiness I'd not dared hope for.
00:31:21.505,00:31:25.384,"Milord mustn't think too highly of me, else I'm afraid he'll be disappointed."
00:31:27.219,00:31:29.137,"You feel that, too?"
00:31:29.179,00:31:33.600,"Well, then, I shall just take you as I find you, if you'll do as much for me."
00:31:40.399,00:31:43.902,All Leonesse will want to know if you've arrived safely.
00:31:43.943,00:31:46.488,John here will take any message you care to send.
00:31:46.530,00:31:49.700,Milord grants my wishes even before I speak them.
00:31:51.201,00:31:54.413,Tell my people I'm come safe into my new country.
00:31:56.164,00:31:59.418,Tell them you saw my eyes filled with tears of joy.
00:32:02.379,00:32:03.922,Already a queen.
00:32:22.107,00:32:23.859,"Agravaine, what happened?"
00:32:23.901,00:32:25.402,"Ambush, sire."
00:32:26.236,00:32:27.279,Malagant?
00:32:27.320,00:32:28.697,Has to be.
00:32:29.698,00:32:32.033,Was Lady Guinevere in danger?
00:32:32.075,00:32:34.661,"We were all in danger, sire."
00:32:34.703,00:32:36.455,Two separate forces.
00:32:38.457,00:32:40.542,"Lady Guinevere was in danger, sire, yes."
00:32:40.584,00:32:41.794,In the course of the second...
00:32:41.835,00:32:44.337,You weren't prepared for the second attack.
00:32:44.379,00:32:47.674,"They'd lost so many men in the first strike, sire."
00:32:47.716,00:32:51.511,"How could we guess they had a second force standing by, just watching their comrades die?"
00:32:51.553,00:32:56.099,"Malagant doesn't care how many men he loses, so long as he wins."
00:32:56.141,00:32:58.143,"I'll not fail you again, sire."
00:32:58.184,00:33:03.231,"We've fought enough battles together to know that no one is perfect, but..."
00:33:03.273,00:33:05.442,I need to know everything.
00:33:05.484,00:33:06.610,Sire.
00:33:11.156,00:33:12.282,Come.
00:33:15.494,00:33:20.874,"I was still a boy when I first climbed this hill, and saw what was to become my city."
00:33:31.384,00:33:33.136,I named it Camelot.
00:33:38.892,00:33:41.770,It's so beautiful it almost frightens me.
00:33:41.812,00:33:43.897,"Well, why do you say that?"
00:33:43.939,00:33:47.609,I was brought up to set no faith in finery.
00:33:47.651,00:33:50.904,"Beauty doesn't last, my father always said."
00:33:50.946,00:33:58.495,"Well, yes, but I remember the way he looked at you, and I remember him saying, Do all fathers think their daughters are so beautiful?"
00:33:59.496,00:34:01.498,He never said that to me.
00:34:07.546,00:34:08.797,Camelot.
00:35:16.615,00:35:19.826,and his new queen!
00:36:18.301,00:36:19.385,Whoa!
00:36:19.427,00:36:21.262,Hey. Good girl.
00:36:27.310,00:36:28.645,Thank you!
00:36:29.896,00:36:31.940,Thank you.
00:36:31.982,00:36:33.984,God knows when she would've stopped.
00:36:34.026,00:36:35.527,Yeah.
00:36:35.568,00:36:36.736,She's a fine animal.
00:36:36.778,00:36:39.447,"Fit for a queen, if she weren't so wild."
00:36:42.200,00:36:44.828,"I'm Peter, king's stableman."
00:36:44.870,00:36:46.705,Lancelot. Which king?
00:36:46.746,00:36:47.789,Which king?
00:36:47.831,00:36:51.043,The king.
00:36:51.084,00:36:54.587,This beauty's supposed to be a gift for his new bride.
00:36:54.629,00:37:01.887,"After all these years, there's those that swore he would never marry, but I knew better."
00:37:01.928,00:37:04.848,He was just waiting for the right one.
00:37:04.890,00:37:06.432,Like we all do.
00:37:12.355,00:37:14.941,"There'll be some feasting today, I can tell you."
00:37:14.983,00:37:17.736,Come along.
00:37:46.556,00:37:49.809,Come on. Beat the gauntlet and meet the king!
00:37:49.851,00:37:53.271,Which one of you out there has got the heart of a lion?
00:37:53.312,00:37:57.984,"Be the first to get right the way through the gauntlet, and you'll be up there drinkin' ale..."
00:37:58.026,00:37:59.152,"Come here, Robert."
00:37:59.194,00:38:01.154,...as if he's your brother.
00:38:01.196,00:38:04.365,Come along!
00:38:01.196,00:38:06.618,"Get up here, get padded up, and beat the gauntlet!"
00:38:06.659,00:38:09.579,What about you boys out there? Yes!
00:38:15.710,00:38:19.589,Give your support to this brave young man!
00:38:22.050,00:38:23.260,Hooray!
00:38:31.434,00:38:32.560,Aw.
00:39:35.581,00:39:40.337,and meet our lovely queen!
00:39:40.378,00:39:43.422,"Will you give the victor a kiss, milady?"
00:39:50.722,00:39:52.390,"How's that, boys?"
00:39:52.431,00:39:56.102,Beat the gauntlet and you'll win a kiss from the Lady Guinevere!
00:39:56.144,00:39:59.356,Soon to be our lovely queen!
00:40:05.362,00:40:07.322,Who will it be?
00:40:42.941,00:40:44.317,Look at that.
00:40:49.989,00:40:53.534,"Not like that, idiot. No."
00:40:54.953,00:40:57.663,Get down! You're mad!
00:40:57.705,00:40:59.457,You'll kill yourself!
00:41:16.433,00:41:17.600,Go on!
00:42:04.981,00:42:06.274,Yes!
00:42:26.461,00:42:31.090,Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
00:42:31.132,00:42:34.135,Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
00:43:02.372,00:43:04.749,Extraordinary.
00:43:05.500,00:43:07.502,What's your name?
00:43:07.544,00:43:08.836,Lancelot.
00:43:09.295,00:43:10.963,Lancelot.
00:43:11.005,00:43:12.965,We won't forget that name.
00:43:14.633,00:43:16.010,Your prize.
00:43:32.651,00:43:33.861,Ask me.
00:43:35.947,00:43:36.989,No.
00:43:38.241,00:43:39.492,Ask me.
00:43:42.412,00:43:43.496,Never.
00:43:56.384,00:43:58.595,I dare not kiss so lovely a lady.
00:44:00.221,00:44:02.515,I only have one heart to lose.
00:44:22.952,00:44:24.036,Come.
00:44:26.664,00:44:27.999,Well done.
00:44:47.935,00:44:50.229,Had you ever run the gauntlet before?
00:44:50.271,00:44:51.730,No. Never.
00:44:51.772,00:44:53.107,So how did you do it?
00:44:55.026,00:44:57.445,It's not hard to know where the danger is if you watch it coming.
00:44:57.487,00:45:00.114,"Well, others have found it hard enough."
00:45:01.157,00:45:03.951,You're the first one to do it.
00:45:03.993,00:45:07.788,Perhaps fear made them go back when they should've gone forward.
00:45:07.830,00:45:09.748,And you felt no fear?
00:45:09.790,00:45:12.627,"No. I have nothing to lose, so what have I to fear?"
00:45:13.169,00:45:15.338,No home? Family?
00:45:15.838,00:45:17.256,No.
00:45:17.298,00:45:19.050,Do you have a profession?
00:45:19.091,00:45:20.801,I live by my sword.
00:45:20.843,00:45:22.178,"Oh, you fight for pay."
00:45:22.220,00:45:23.804,Yes.
00:45:23.846,00:45:25.515,Nobody paid you to run the gauntlet.
00:45:28.142,00:45:30.520,"I knew I could do it, so I did it."
00:45:32.729,00:45:37.610,"Well, Lancelot, you're an unusual man."
00:45:37.652,00:45:44.867,"I don't believe I've ever seen such a display of courage, skill, nerve, grace and stupidity."
00:45:49.914,00:45:51.332,Come.
00:45:54.877,00:45:59.173,"that every life is precious, even the lives of strangers."
00:45:59.798,00:46:05.137,"If you must die, die serving something greater than yourself."
00:46:05.179,00:46:08.600,"Better still, live and serve."
00:46:11.436,00:46:12.937,The round table.
00:46:12.978,00:46:14.188,Yes.
00:46:16.441,00:46:18.817,This is where the high council of Camelot meets.
00:46:20.945,00:46:22.863,No head. No foot.
00:46:23.906,00:46:25.908,Everyone equal.
00:46:25.950,00:46:27.076,Even the king.
00:46:28.911,00:46:34.041,"In serving each other, we become free."
00:46:34.083,00:46:41.633,"That is the very heart of Camelot, not these stones, timbers, towers, palaces."
00:46:42.258,00:46:48.347,"Burn them all, and Camelot lives on, because it lives in us."
00:46:48.389,00:46:51.350,It's a belief we hold in our hearts.
00:46:58.441,00:47:00.067,"Well, no matter."
00:47:02.861,00:47:05.197,Stay in Camelot.
00:47:07.992,00:47:09.786,but I'll be on the road again soon.
00:47:09.826,00:47:12.664,Oh? What road?
00:47:12.705,00:47:16.083,Wherever chance takes me.
00:47:16.125,00:47:19.796,So you believe that what you do is a matter of chance?
00:47:20.963,00:47:22.423,Yes.
00:47:22.465,00:47:27.386,"Well, at the end of that hallway, there are two doors, one to the left and one to the right."
00:47:27.428,00:47:31.265,How will you decide which door to take?
00:47:31.307,00:47:33.643,"Left or right, it makes no difference."
00:47:34.851,00:47:38.815,"Then I hope chance leads you to the left, because it's the only way out."
00:47:45.070,00:47:46.489,Lancelot.
00:47:47.824,00:47:50.618,Just a thought.
00:47:50.660,00:47:53.912,A man who fears nothing is a man who loves nothing.
00:47:54.664,00:47:58.710,"And if you love nothing, what joy is there in your life?"
00:48:01.128,00:48:02.672,I may be wrong.
00:48:28.364,00:48:31.242,"Peter, show us how she goes."
00:48:42.044,00:48:43.462,She's yours.
00:48:45.464,00:48:47.174,She's beautiful.
00:48:47.216,00:48:50.969,Peter thinks she's not suitable for a lady.
00:48:51.011,00:48:53.305,She's just the horse I would've chosen for myself.
00:48:53.347,00:48:55.015,I know.
00:48:55.057,00:48:56.768,How do you know?
00:48:56.809,00:49:00.937,You remember last spring at Leonesse when you joined your father and me on the hunt?
00:49:02.189,00:49:03.858,You were fearless.
00:49:04.901,00:49:07.278,My father's word was reckless.
00:49:07.319,00:49:10.615,"Yes, well, he was always sparing with his praise."
00:49:11.365,00:49:12.450,Come.
00:49:14.535,00:49:18.038,"Well, so much space we could almost be alone."
00:49:18.080,00:49:19.707,You have secrets to tell me?
00:49:19.749,00:49:21.459,Nope.
00:49:21.500,00:49:24.545,No secrets.
00:49:26.088,00:49:28.090,Do you want to marry me?
00:49:28.633,00:49:30.134,Milord?
00:49:30.175,00:49:35.306,"You don't have to marry me because your father wanted it, or because your country needs it."
00:49:35.347,00:49:38.517,Camelot will protect Leonesse whether you marry me or not.
00:49:40.519,00:49:41.854,Thank you.
00:49:44.440,00:49:47.902,You don't know what it means to me to hear you say that.
00:49:51.948,00:49:55.785,So you want to be released from the engagement.
00:50:03.542,00:50:13.260,"No. I want to marry you, not your crown or your army or your golden city."
00:50:13.302,00:50:14.637,Just you.
00:50:15.346,00:50:16.263,Just me?
00:50:17.013,00:50:20.476,Yes. If you love me.
00:50:26.524,00:50:28.275,Do you remember this?
00:50:28.317,00:50:29.902,Of course.
00:50:29.944,00:50:31.904,You hurt it on the thorn bush in the hunt.
00:50:31.946,00:50:34.239,Hadn't thought it would leave such a scar.
00:50:34.281,00:50:36.116,Just a scratch.
00:50:36.158,00:50:37.869,Yet it bled like a war wound.
00:50:37.910,00:50:39.996,I remember.
00:50:40.036,00:50:44.583,You took my hand in yours and you wiped the blood away with the sleeve of your dress.
00:50:44.625,00:50:46.251,The sleeve still carries the stain.
00:50:47.962,00:50:55.177,I never thought until that moment how sweet it must be to be loved by one woman.
00:50:55.219,00:51:00.056,"And for the first time in my life, I wanted..."
00:51:05.187,00:51:06.355,What?
00:51:08.941,00:51:11.861,"Oh, what all wise men say doesn't last."
00:51:11.903,00:51:18.116,"What cannot be promised or made to linger any more than sunlight, but..."
00:51:18.158,00:51:23.581,I don't want to die without having felt its warmth on my face.
00:51:26.584,00:51:30.504,"Marry the king, Guinevere, but love the man."
00:51:32.339,00:51:39.013,"I only know one way to love, milord, and that is body and heart and soul."
00:51:46.062,00:51:49.273,I kiss the hurt that brought me your love.
00:51:56.363,00:51:57.615,Try her.
00:52:04.329,00:52:06.122,Shall I fetch her lady's saddle?
00:52:06.164,00:52:07.416,No need.
00:52:30.064,00:52:32.190,"She's a rare beauty, sire."
00:52:32.817,00:52:34.693,"Yes, she is."
00:52:34.735,00:52:36.403,So is the mare.
00:53:06.058,00:53:13.315,"May God grant us the wisdom to discover the right, the will to choose it, and the strength to make it endure."
00:53:13.357,00:53:14.316,Amen.
00:53:19.071,00:53:22.741,"My friends, as you all know, I am soon to be married."
00:53:22.783,00:53:23.993,"And about time, too."
00:53:26.954,00:53:28.998,our share of war.
00:53:29.040,00:53:31.959,Now I look forward to quieter days.
00:53:33.418,00:53:37.173,"But first, admit our guest."
00:53:43.261,00:53:45.890,Prince Malagant is here at my invitation.
00:53:55.733,00:53:58.986,May I congratulate the king on his forthcoming marriage?
00:54:04.075,00:54:06.744,I see my place hasn't been taken yet.
00:54:12.166,00:54:15.002,To think that I was once first among your knights.
00:54:15.044,00:54:17.963,You left this council of your own free will.
00:54:18.005,00:54:22.009,"We each of us must follow our own road, milord, and mine had further to go."
00:54:22.051,00:54:24.845,"And where does your road take you, Malagant?"
00:54:24.887,00:54:26.304,To Leonesse?
00:54:27.765,00:54:30.893,Leonesse is my neighbor.
00:54:30.935,00:54:33.269,And I've offered the lady a treaty of friendship.
00:54:33.311,00:54:35.106,I still await an answer.
00:54:35.147,00:54:37.983,You call burning villages an act of friendship?
00:54:38.025,00:54:40.069,"Well, yes, milady."
00:54:40.111,00:54:43.530,"Since your honored father's death, your land has been more lawless by the day."
00:54:43.572,00:54:46.242,"Were you, yourself, not attacked on the road here?"
00:54:46.282,00:54:47.993,You know who attacked me.
00:54:48.035,00:54:50.662,I made it my business to know.
00:54:50.704,00:54:53.707,The bandits have been hunted down.
00:54:53.749,00:54:56.835,What justice?
00:54:56.877,00:55:00.464,Armed forces to be given access to all Leonesse.
00:55:02.507,00:55:07.554,Troops to assist in the enforcement of law in all Leonesse.
00:55:10.099,00:55:11.183,Do you want to sign this?
00:55:11.225,00:55:12.350,I'll never sign it.
00:55:12.392,00:55:14.770,There's your answer.
00:55:14.812,00:55:18.857,"She's very brave, now she's to be married."
00:55:21.443,00:55:24.155,"So, is Leonesse to come under the protection of Camelot?"
00:55:24.196,00:55:26.615,Is Leonesse in need of protection?
00:55:27.323,00:55:28.784,"Come, Arthur."
00:55:30.286,00:55:31.745,I'm here to settle this business.
00:55:34.039,00:55:36.250,We both know Leonesse is too weak to stand alone.
00:55:37.042,00:55:38.961,Let's say half each.
00:55:39.003,00:55:41.255,The lesser gives way to the greater.
00:55:41.297,00:55:44.466,And what nation could be greater than Camelot?
00:55:44.508,00:55:47.343,The land of justice and the hope of mankind.
00:55:48.220,00:55:50.430,Come. Your hand on it.
00:55:50.472,00:55:53.600,We'll all live together as friends.
00:55:53.642,00:55:55.978,You offer me what isn't yours to give.
00:56:00.899,00:56:02.484,You all know me.
00:56:03.902,00:56:06.655,You know I'm a man of my word.
00:56:06.697,00:56:08.240,Don't make an enemy of me.
00:56:10.366,00:56:12.368,I mean no harm to Camelot.
00:56:13.787,00:56:17.166,You know the law we live by.
00:56:17.208,00:56:21.503,"And where is it written, Beyond Camelot live lesser people?"
00:56:21.545,00:56:25.507,"People too weak to protect themselves, let them die? Hmm?"
00:56:25.549,00:56:28.844,"Other people live by other laws, Arthur."
00:56:28.886,00:56:32.388,Or is the law of Camelot to rule the entire world?
00:56:32.430,00:56:37.353,that enslave men and laws that set them free.
00:56:37.393,00:56:50.615,"Either what we hold to be right and good and true is right and good and true for all mankind under God, or we're just another robber tribe."
00:56:50.657,00:56:54.494,Your fine words are talking you out of peace and into war.
00:56:54.536,00:56:58.790,There's a peace that's only to be found on the other side of war.
00:56:58.832,00:57:02.294,"If that battle must come, I will fight it!"
00:57:02.336,00:57:03.379,And I!
00:57:08.926,00:57:13.097,"The great Arthur, and his great dream."
00:57:17.059,00:57:19.144,No dream lasts forever.
00:57:21.772,00:57:23.607,of the army?
00:57:23.648,00:57:26.235,Two battalions under arms.
00:57:26.277,00:57:28.028,"I'll double the watch on all gates, sire."
00:57:28.070,00:57:31.073,"Sire, I don't believe Malagant wants war with Camelot."
00:57:31.115,00:57:33.909,Arm the reserves.
00:57:33.951,00:57:35.244,And he thinks he can win.
00:57:35.286,00:57:36.703,He wants Leonesse as a buffer.
00:57:36.745,00:57:38.247,He wants Camelot.
00:57:38.830,00:57:40.665,He always has.
00:57:40.707,00:57:42.960,How soon could he attack?
00:57:43.001,00:57:45.587,There's no army within five days' march of Camelot.
00:57:47.214,00:57:50.217,"Well, so much for my quieter days."
00:58:23.459,00:58:26.878,with a message for Lady Guinevere.
00:58:31.049,00:58:32.259,Enter.
00:58:33.427,00:58:35.429,"Milady, it's Jacob."
00:58:35.471,00:58:36.847,Jacob? Where?
00:58:36.888,00:58:37.889,Coming to the north gate.
00:58:38.974,00:58:40.267,Leonesse.
00:58:49.067,00:58:50.277,Jacob?
00:58:51.403,00:58:52.529,"Mind the step, milady."
00:58:52.570,00:58:53.822,"Jacob, what is it?"
00:59:07.461,00:59:09.213,Lady Guinevere!
01:00:13.777,01:00:14.861,No!
01:00:23.828,01:00:25.080,"Go, go!"
01:00:53.733,01:00:56.736,Taken? Taken where?
01:00:56.778,01:00:58.322,"A boat, sire."
01:00:58.363,01:00:59.656,In which direction was she taken?
01:00:59.697,01:01:00.782,"Into the forests, sire."
01:01:00.824,01:01:03.619,"I have scouts out already, sire, and dogs."
01:01:03.660,01:01:05.036,Give me a battalion of guards.
01:01:05.078,01:01:06.330,No.
01:01:06.371,01:01:07.498,"Give me the men, sire, and I'll get her back."
01:01:07.539,01:01:09.625,No. Exactly what he wants.
01:01:10.375,01:01:11.585,Take one brigade now.
01:01:11.627,01:01:12.961,Sire.
01:01:19.676,01:01:23.972,"He'll not harm her, sire."
01:01:24.014,01:01:27.100,He'll try to trade her to get what he wants.
01:01:27.142,01:01:29.645,"That's what I'm afraid of, Agravaine."
01:01:31.522,01:01:36.151,"I'd give my life for her, but what if he asks for more than I can give?"
01:02:37.003,01:02:38.380,Whoa. Whoa.
01:03:20.964,01:03:25.927,"Welcome to my palace, milady."
01:03:36.104,01:03:39.274,I think we can release the lady from her bonds...
01:03:41.901,01:03:43.570,If she so wishes.
01:03:54.790,01:03:56.291,What's this?
01:03:57.584,01:03:59.586,Your dress is torn.
01:03:59.628,01:04:00.712,Ralf?
01:04:00.754,01:04:02.213,"Yes, my prince?"
01:04:02.255,01:04:04.675,I gave orders that the lady was not to be harmed.
01:04:04.716,01:04:06.009,"But, my prince, I didn't..."
01:04:25.612,01:04:28.114,"Your dress is quite spoiled, milady."
01:04:29.533,01:04:31.117,You!
01:04:31.951,01:04:37.915,Almost a queen.
01:04:42.003,01:04:44.088,-Ralf.
01:04:44.130,01:04:45.757,Did you do this?
01:04:47.050,01:04:48.635,"Yes, my prince."
01:04:49.469,01:04:51.262,You see?
01:04:51.304,01:04:54.307,This is what Arthur doesn't understand.
01:04:54.349,01:04:56.518,Men don't want brotherhood.
01:04:57.268,01:04:58.812,They want leadership.
01:04:58.854,01:04:59.937,Ho!
01:05:08.238,01:05:09.531,Shall we?
01:05:19.416,01:05:22.669,They say this was once the greatest castle ever built.
01:05:22.711,01:05:26.882,Now grass grows in the halls where kings once feasted.
01:05:26.923,01:05:31.762,"And peasants cart away the mighty walls stone by stone, to make shelters for their pigs."
01:05:31.803,01:05:33.221,Ha!
01:05:33.263,01:05:34.347,Such is glory.
01:05:34.389,01:05:36.850,What do you mean to do with me?
01:05:36.892,01:05:40.103,I mean to keep you here until Arthur becomes more reasonable.
01:05:40.144,01:05:42.647,He'll not trade Leonesse for my life.
01:05:42.689,01:05:44.775,"I'd rather die, and Arthur knows that."
01:05:44.816,01:05:47.444,"Of course, self-sacrifice is very easy."
01:05:48.862,01:05:55.159,It's having to sacrifice someone you love that puts your convictions to the test.
01:05:55.201,01:06:00.081,I'm sure you'll find Arthur will come round to the merits of compromise.
01:06:24.021,01:06:26.107,This is what's called an oubliette.
01:06:27.233,01:06:30.320,That's French for a place of forgetting.
01:06:33.114,01:06:35.617,"Your quarters, milady."
01:06:35.659,01:06:39.621,"No gates, no bars, no locks."
01:06:42.373,01:06:44.041,Just walls of air.
01:07:42.475,01:07:44.101,You can come out.
01:07:47.271,01:07:49.440,"I'm unarmed, and I'm alone."
01:08:31.441,01:08:33.026,Who are you?
01:08:33.068,01:08:35.152,A messenger from the king.
01:08:37.488,01:08:38.656,He came alone?
01:08:38.698,01:08:39.950,"Yes, my prince."
01:08:44.621,01:08:46.998,"So, what is your message?"
01:08:47.040,01:08:49.960,I need to know the Lady Guinevere is unharmed first.
01:08:50.001,01:08:52.629,She's unharmed.
01:08:55.172,01:08:57.467,I need to see with my own eyes.
01:08:57.508,01:08:59.636,My word isn't good enough for you?
01:08:59.677,01:09:01.096,"I'm a common man, sir."
01:09:01.137,01:09:02.388,I don't have much use for words.
01:09:14.109,01:09:16.653,He does have a message for me.
01:09:16.694,01:09:18.696,"Take him down to the pit, then bring him back here."
01:09:18.738,01:09:20.615,Give me a chance to finish my food.
01:09:40.010,01:09:42.095,"All right, you've seen her."
01:09:42.137,01:09:43.220,No.
01:09:45.140,01:09:47.517,You have orders to kill me before I've delivered my message?
01:09:47.558,01:09:50.478,All right.
01:10:10.289,01:10:12.249,Jump on! Jump!
01:10:15.628,01:10:19.215,Throw it at him!
01:10:19.256,01:10:20.466,Get him!
01:10:30.977,01:10:33.063,Come on! Jump! Jump!
01:10:47.994,01:10:50.997,"If the water can get out, so can we. Come on."
01:11:30.912,01:11:32.371,No! Hold on!
01:11:35.708,01:11:37.210,"Come on, men!"
01:12:39.981,01:12:41.107,Whoa.
01:13:07.008,01:13:08.509,Why are we stopped?
01:13:13.806,01:13:15.141,I'm tired.
01:13:16.809,01:13:18.102,Never.
01:13:19.145,01:13:21.314,You battle in your dreams.
01:13:46.756,01:13:48.174,What are you doing?
01:13:49.050,01:13:50.385,You'll see.
01:14:00.644,01:14:02.230,Now drink.
01:14:10.863,01:14:12.031,Again.
01:14:18.662,01:14:19.705,Mmm.
01:14:24.961,01:14:26.670,Where did you learn to do that?
01:14:26.712,01:14:30.091,"Well, I've lived most of my life out in the open."
01:14:32.843,01:14:35.012,Don't you have a home?
01:14:36.722,01:14:38.891,"No, I don't have a home."
01:14:40.393,01:14:42.270,Not for a long time.
01:14:42.312,01:14:44.063,That must be hard.
01:14:44.105,01:14:46.899,Why? Why must it be?
01:14:46.941,01:14:50.153,I'm my own master.
01:14:50.194,01:14:52.029,I've nothing to lose.
01:14:53.614,01:14:55.866,Why build a house for the warlords to burn?
01:14:58.828,01:15:00.288,Is that how it happened?
01:15:07.628,01:15:09.880,God save you from such a day.
01:15:12.508,01:15:14.469,How old were you?
01:15:17.930,01:15:19.390,No!
01:15:25.771,01:15:27.273,No.
01:15:28.941,01:15:30.151,Mother!
01:15:34.364,01:15:35.572,No.
01:15:45.791,01:15:47.502,It was long ago.
01:15:56.427,01:15:58.721,God save us all from such a day.
01:16:00.056,01:16:01.598,Didn't save me.
01:16:03.934,01:16:05.478,"Ah, but he did."
01:16:07.021,01:16:08.064,For what?
01:16:08.105,01:16:10.316,It made you who you are.
01:16:11.608,01:16:14.028,A man who fears nothing and no one.
01:16:15.530,01:16:17.448,You can use that gift for some good purpose.
01:16:17.490,01:16:21.577,"If not, you might as well have died in the church with the others."
01:16:21.618,01:16:25.164,You don't know how many times I've wished for that.
01:16:25.206,01:16:28.125,But you didn't die.
01:16:34.549,01:16:36.717,"Tell me what to do, and I'll do it."
01:16:36.759,01:16:38.219,Your life is your own.
01:16:38.261,01:16:39.887,I give it to you.
01:16:43.516,01:16:45.268,You forget I'm to be married.
01:16:50.689,01:16:55.570,"If you were free to do as you pleased, would you marry Arthur?"
01:16:55.611,01:16:57.447,I am free.
01:16:57.488,01:16:59.365,As free as you are.
01:16:59.407,01:17:00.908,-Prove it.
01:17:00.950,01:17:02.410,Forget who you are.
01:17:02.452,01:17:10.334,"Let all the world go away, and all the people in it, but you and me."
01:17:12.669,01:17:20.052,"Do what you want to do, here, now."
01:17:50.625,01:17:52.502,There she is!
01:18:33.417,01:18:34.460,Oh!
01:18:35.836,01:18:37.754,"Oh, thank you, God."
01:19:26.845,01:19:28.180,Thank you.
01:19:41.110,01:19:42.819,Thank you.
01:19:42.861,01:19:44.321,You can go.
01:19:44.363,01:19:47.157,I'm sure you have better things to do than dress me.
01:19:47.199,01:19:50.327,You have given me back my life itself.
01:19:50.369,01:19:52.288,The least I can do is give you back your shirt.
01:19:52.329,01:19:53.872,Milord.
01:19:53.914,01:19:56.292,Tell me what you want and it's yours.
01:19:56.333,01:19:58.001,I did what any man would have done.
01:19:58.043,01:20:00.921,"No, no, you risked your life for another."
01:20:00.963,01:20:02.465,There is no greater love.
01:20:06.885,01:20:08.554,You have deceived me.
01:20:09.680,01:20:11.766,But now I know the truth.
01:20:13.350,01:20:15.645,The truth is you care nothing for yourself.
01:20:15.686,01:20:16.604,"Well, look at you."
01:20:16.646,01:20:19.856,"No wealth, no home, no gold."
01:20:19.898,01:20:23.277,Just the passionate spirit that drives you on.
01:20:24.570,01:20:31.327,"God uses people like you, Lancelot, because your heart is open."
01:20:31.368,01:20:34.913,"You hold nothing back, give all of yourself."
01:20:36.707,01:20:39.084,"If you knew me better, you wouldn't say such things."
01:20:39.126,01:20:40.377,"Oh, come on."
01:20:40.419,01:20:42.546,"Hey, I take the good with the bad."
01:20:42.588,01:20:43.839,Together.
01:20:45.174,01:20:47.384,I can't love people in slices.
01:20:48.552,01:20:50.471,"Now, no more protests."
01:20:51.597,01:20:53.890,Let me thank you in my own way.
01:21:02.775,01:21:04.652,They're welcoming you back.
01:21:10.115,01:21:14.244,We owe Lady Guinevere's life to one man.
01:21:18.749,01:21:20.000,Lancelot.
01:21:30.886,01:21:39.061,"I believe he comes to Camelot for a purpose, even though he doesn't know it himself."
01:21:40.979,01:21:45.442,And what I'm about to offer this man is already his.
01:21:46.777,01:21:49.279,One seat stands empty.
01:21:52.575,01:21:54.535,"You'd make him a knight, sire?"
01:21:54.577,01:21:59.790,"What I offer is no life of privilege, but a life of service."
01:21:59.832,01:22:03.794,"And if you want it, it's yours, with all my heart."
01:22:03.836,01:22:05.796,"Sire, we don't know anything about him."
01:22:05.838,01:22:07.172,They say he fights for money.
01:22:07.214,01:22:08.424,"Sire, perhaps we should discuss this."
01:22:08.465,01:22:09.884,Enough!
01:22:11.510,01:22:13.262,What do you say?
01:22:13.303,01:22:14.847,Will you join us?
01:22:14.889,01:22:16.849,"Milord, if I may speak?"
01:22:19.017,01:22:26.567,"I owe this man, more than anyone here, and he deserves any honor you can give him."
01:22:27.777,01:22:30.320,But he doesn't belong in Camelot.
01:22:30.362,01:22:33.741,Lancelot's a man who...
01:22:33.783,01:22:37.620,And in that freedom and solitude is his strength.
01:22:39.663,01:22:47.922,"If you wish to honor him, as I do, from the bottom of my heart, then let's honor him as he is and not as we would make him."
01:22:50.132,01:22:56.555,"Let him go, alone and free, and with our love."
01:23:00.476,01:23:01.727,Well...
01:23:02.269,01:23:03.312,Lancelot?
01:23:09.693,01:23:12.279,Lady Guinevere understands me well.
01:23:13.363,01:23:22.623,"But here, among you, I have found something that I want more than freedom."
01:23:25.375,01:23:29.964,"I no longer know what life I am to live, only that it would break my heart to leave you."
01:23:30.005,01:23:32.633,"Oh, bravo."
01:23:34.760,01:23:36.219,Yes.
01:23:36.261,01:23:37.805,Welcome.
01:23:37.847,01:23:40.641,"This is only the beginning, hmm?"
01:23:40.683,01:23:47.773,"Go pass this night in prayer, for tomorrow at sunrise, you'll be born again into a new life."
01:24:10.504,01:24:11.630,Why?
01:24:12.882,01:24:14.341,You know why.
01:24:16.051,01:24:17.594,Please leave Camelot.
01:24:17.636,01:24:19.095,I want to be wherever you are.
01:24:19.137,01:24:21.181,You must not say such things to me.
01:24:21.223,01:24:22.892,What am I to say?
01:24:23.266,01:24:24.476,Nothing.
01:24:31.441,01:24:35.654,I will leave Camelot now if you come with me.
01:24:35.696,01:24:37.113,No!
01:24:37.155,01:24:39.408,Then tell me you don't love me.
01:24:45.330,01:24:47.207,I don't love you.
01:26:05.953,01:26:08.122,"Arise, Sir Lancelot."
01:26:15.045,01:26:18.214,"Brother to brother, yours in life and death."
01:26:23.762,01:26:27.474,"Brother to brother, yours in life and death."
01:26:44.574,01:26:46.326,Brother to brother...
01:26:50.288,01:26:52.958,"Brother to brother, yours in life..."
01:26:53.000,01:26:55.711,"Brother to brother, yours in life and death."
01:26:55.752,01:26:59.339,"Brother to brother, yours in life and death."
01:27:45.385,01:27:50.974,"In nomine Patris, et fili, et Spiritus Sanctus."
01:27:51.892,01:27:53.852,Amen.
01:27:53.894,01:27:58.648,"and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen, and to protect her honor as my own."
01:28:00.817,01:28:06.031,"I swear to love and serve Guinevere, my true and rightful queen, and to protect her honor as my own."
01:28:11.245,01:28:12.454,Jacob!
01:28:14.248,01:28:18.252,"Forgive me, milady, but Malagant has taken Leonesse."
01:30:10.989,01:30:12.406,Leonesse.
01:30:14.450,01:30:16.370,The gates are open.
01:30:19.831,01:30:20.957,Make camp for the night.
01:30:20.999,01:30:22.458,"Where, sire?"
01:30:24.544,01:30:25.712,There.
01:30:27.005,01:30:28.048,"It's too exposed, sire."
01:30:28.090,01:30:30.133,We could never possibly defend...
01:30:31.551,01:30:32.635,Sire.
01:31:35.407,01:31:36.616,Straw!
01:31:37.784,01:31:38.868,They're not here.
01:31:42.580,01:31:43.832,There's no one here!
01:31:56.761,01:31:57.971,Loose!
01:32:21.203,01:32:22.287,Charge!
01:32:40.972,01:32:42.974,Attack! Attack!
01:34:12.105,01:34:13.356,"Archers in position, sire."
01:34:13.398,01:34:14.690,Hold position.
01:34:21.281,01:34:23.116,"Their left wing's falling back, sire."
01:34:23.158,01:34:26.035,Second battalion into the left flank. Attack!
01:34:38.965,01:34:40.091,Is our center holding?
01:34:41.343,01:34:42.927,"Guards, charge!"
01:36:10.682,01:36:11.849,"They're breaking, sire."
01:36:11.891,01:36:13.976,Do not give chase.
01:36:14.018,01:36:15.895,"First battalion regrouped, sire."
01:36:15.937,01:36:17.063,Sound the advance.
01:36:35.081,01:36:37.417,"They're running, sire."
01:36:37.459,01:36:39.877,"No, no. Let them go."
01:36:39.919,01:36:41.504,On to Leonesse!
01:36:53.266,01:36:54.684,Well done.
01:36:57.395,01:37:01.107,"Your sword, Sir Lancelot."
01:38:38.287,01:38:39.372,No!
01:38:40.415,01:38:41.499,No!
01:39:19.537,01:39:21.330,Come out! Come on!
01:39:21.372,01:39:23.708,They're alive!
01:39:28.296,01:39:29.464,We're the knights of Camelot.
01:39:29.505,01:39:31.716,You're safe.
01:39:37.012,01:39:38.848,Take my arm.
01:39:38.890,01:39:41.016,"I love thee, Lady Guinevere!"
01:39:42.268,01:39:44.019,"Yes, we're glad you're safe."
01:39:44.061,01:39:45.979,"Thank you, your majesty."
01:39:47.315,01:39:49.776,Food and water for you all.
01:39:51.193,01:39:53.321,"There's a step, milord."
01:39:56.783,01:39:59.410,all the bad men have gone now.
01:39:59.452,01:40:00.829,"Take my arm, father."
01:40:00.870,01:40:02.789,"Oh, there she is."
01:40:04.874,01:40:08.085,children. You're safe now.
01:40:14.926,01:40:18.011,"God bless you, sir."
01:40:27.020,01:40:28.272,I'm so old now.
01:40:36.531,01:40:38.491,Can I go home now?
01:40:40.326,01:40:41.577,Yes.
01:40:42.537,01:40:44.747,"Yes, you can go home now."
01:40:51.420,01:40:52.714,to the knight.
01:40:52.755,01:40:53.965,the falls.
01:40:55.132,01:40:57.301,"Bless you, milady."
01:41:46.517,01:41:47.936,Elise.
01:42:07.204,01:42:12.209,I've come to say good-bye and wish you well.
01:42:13.962,01:42:16.714,It's been a long night.
01:42:21.094,01:42:23.387,Where will you go?
01:42:23.429,01:42:26.474,Don't know.
01:42:28.392,01:42:30.478,And when shall we expect to see you again?
01:42:33.564,01:42:35.942,I don't think I'll be coming back.
01:42:39.612,01:42:40.822,Never?
01:42:43.825,01:42:44.993,Never.
01:42:49.998,01:42:52.249,"See, I know what I must do now."
01:42:54.376,01:42:56.879,I never believed in anything before.
01:42:57.755,01:42:59.924,But I do believe in Camelot.
01:43:01.968,01:43:04.261,I will serve it best by leaving.
01:43:08.557,01:43:13.855,Tell the king that I will always remember that he saw the best in me.
01:43:17.025,01:43:19.234,And what shall I tell myself?
01:43:21.863,01:43:25.992,That there was once a man who loved you too much to change you.
01:43:29.453,01:43:31.204,I'll not forget him.
01:43:35.292,01:43:37.920,I sheltered under a tree with him once.
01:43:39.588,01:43:40.965,In the rain.
01:43:53.019,01:43:54.269,Lancelot.
01:44:02.904,01:44:04.155,My queen.
01:44:06.074,01:44:07.742,I owe you a kiss.
01:44:12.788,01:44:14.331,I'm asking you.
01:45:54.389,01:45:55.474,Why?
01:45:56.934,01:45:58.853,Why?
01:46:13.450,01:46:15.036,"The king asks for you, milady."
01:46:33.595,01:46:38.184,"I ask you not to lie to me, even if you think you'll hurt me."
01:46:39.476,01:46:43.356,Have you given yourself to him?
01:46:43.396,01:46:44.773,"No, milord."
01:46:50.154,01:46:51.822,Do you love him?
01:46:56.535,01:46:57.619,Yes.
01:47:12.676,01:47:14.553,How did I fail you?
01:47:16.680,01:47:19.350,"You've never failed me, milord."
01:47:19.392,01:47:21.810,I saw your face as you kissed him.
01:47:23.354,01:47:26.439,Love has many faces.
01:47:26.481,01:47:29.235,"I may look on you differently, but not with less love."
01:47:32.154,01:47:35.448,"When a woman loves two men, she must choose between them."
01:47:35.490,01:47:36.951,I choose you.
01:47:38.119,01:47:39.954,Your will chooses me.
01:47:41.122,01:47:42.915,Your heart chooses him.
01:47:42.957,01:47:44.541,Then you have the best of it.
01:47:44.583,01:47:47.253,My will is stronger than my heart.
01:47:47.295,01:47:51.299,Do you think I put so high a price on my feelings?
01:47:51.340,01:47:53.842,"Feelings live for a moment, and the moment passes."
01:47:53.884,01:47:57.388,My will holds me steady to my course through life.
01:47:58.513,01:48:07.189,"As mine does me, and yet, all I have to do is look at you, and everything I ever believed in fades to nothing."
01:48:08.732,01:48:10.692,All I want is your love.
01:48:11.319,01:48:12.611,You have it.
01:48:12.653,01:48:13.779,Do I?
01:48:14.696,01:48:15.864,Do I?
01:48:17.074,01:48:19.994,Then look on me as you looked on him.
01:48:25.333,01:48:26.417,Wha...
01:48:31.630,01:48:35.092,I gave one moment to Lancelot.
01:48:36.677,01:48:39.430,"Oh, yes."
01:48:39.472,01:48:41.140,But you love him!
01:48:45.686,01:48:48.230,"Any more of this innocence, and I'll go mad."
01:48:50.691,01:48:52.901,I'll do whatever you tell me to.
01:48:52.943,01:48:55.696,I don't know what to think or what to feel anymore.
01:48:55.737,01:48:56.780,I...
01:48:58.657,01:49:00.993,I no longer see my way ahead.
01:49:08.709,01:49:11.504,Only fools dream of the one thing they can't have.
01:49:15.632,01:49:17.176,Forgive me.
01:49:24.725,01:49:27.019,I dreamed a dream of you.
01:49:32.565,01:49:39.698,"It was a sweet dream, while it lasted."
01:50:03.347,01:50:04.557,Unlock the door.
01:50:04.597,01:50:05.724,Sire.
01:50:12.647,01:50:13.732,Milord.
01:50:13.774,01:50:15.734,I'll ask the questions.
01:50:20.406,01:50:23.534,Did you come to Camelot to betray me?
01:50:25.244,01:50:27.079,"No, milord."
01:50:27.121,01:50:29.081,You desired her?
01:50:29.123,01:50:30.665,You pursued her?
01:50:30.707,01:50:32.167,"The queen is innocent, milord."
01:50:32.209,01:50:34.169,Innocent?
01:50:34.211,01:50:36.297,I saw her in your arms.
01:50:36.338,01:50:39.133,"I trusted you, loved you, and you betrayed me!"
01:50:39.174,01:50:40.926,"I never meant to hurt you, milord."
01:50:40.968,01:50:42.470,You leave me nothing!
01:50:42.511,01:50:44.430,-Milord...
01:50:50.478,01:50:53.730,You will be charged with treason under our laws.
01:50:53.772,01:50:56.233,Defend yourself in court.
01:50:56.275,01:50:58.486,The law will judge you!
01:51:11.832,01:51:18.255,"May God grant us wisdom to discover the right, the will to choose it and the strength to make it endure."
01:51:18.922,01:51:20.007,Amen.
01:51:24.512,01:51:27.431,I was mistaken in Lancelot.
01:51:27.473,01:51:29.933,"As a man, I may forgive."
01:51:29.975,01:51:33.479,"As a king, I must see justice done."
01:51:33.521,01:51:38.233,There will be a public trial tomorrow at noon in the great square.
01:51:38.275,01:51:41.862,"-But, sire, the queen..."
01:51:41.903,01:51:44.990,"Better to settle the matter in private, sire."
01:51:45.032,01:51:49.036,You think the honor of Camelot is a private matter?
01:51:49.077,01:51:53.290,"Am I to hide in dark corners, as if I'm ashamed?"
01:51:53.332,01:51:57.252,Open the city gates.
01:51:57.294,01:51:58.920,The people will know the truth.
01:51:58.962,01:52:03.050,Let every citizen see that the law rules in Camelot.
01:52:07.179,01:52:27.408,"Lady of Leonesse, Queen of Camelot, and Lancelot, Knight of the High Council, are charged in their own persons, and in collusion, one with the other, with dishonor to the realm and violation of the king's rights under law."
01:52:30.452,01:52:38.001,"These crimes constitute an act of treason against the kingdom of Camelot, and the penalty under law is death."
01:52:43.840,01:52:46.635,Sir Lancelot may speak to the charges.
01:52:46.677,01:52:48.887,What I have to say is for the king alone.
01:53:08.990,01:53:14.037,"Milord, the queen is innocent."
01:53:16.831,01:53:27.718,"But if my life, or my death, serves Camelot, take it."
01:53:27.760,01:53:29.720,Do what you like with me.
01:53:41.398,01:53:45.902,"Brother to brother, yours in life and death."
01:54:15.349,01:54:19.102,Is it the king's wish the queen be questioned by this court?
01:54:24.358,01:54:26.443,May God forgive me.
01:54:33.575,01:54:37.746,Is it the king's wish that the queen should be questioned by this court?
01:54:40.332,01:54:41.375,Who goes there?
01:54:42.835,01:54:44.753,who goes there?
01:54:44.795,01:54:46.087,Guards!
01:54:47.840,01:54:49.299,Close the gates!
01:54:49.341,01:54:51.218,Close the city gates!
01:55:08.527,01:55:11.071,Get back! Go on!
01:55:18.495,01:55:19.996,Whoa. Whoa!
01:55:26.253,01:55:29.673,Nobody move or Arthur dies.
01:55:29.715,01:55:33.385,My men control the city gates and every exit from this square.
01:55:33.427,01:55:38.599,"On every roof, I have men with burning torches."
01:55:38.640,01:55:42.770,"I have only to lift my arm, and your golden city burns to ashes."
01:55:44.145,01:55:46.481,I am the law now.
01:55:46.523,01:55:49.610,"You obeyed Arthur, and now you obey me."
01:55:51.027,01:55:54.322,"My people are unarmed, Malagant."
01:55:54.364,01:55:57.659,"If it's me you want, here I am."
01:56:00.954,01:56:03.164,Look at him!
01:56:03.206,01:56:06.418,Look at the great King Arthur of Camelot.
01:56:06.460,01:56:09.922,Ha! He's a man waking up from a dream.
01:56:10.923,01:56:13.550,The strong rule the weak.
01:56:15.135,01:56:17.429,That's how your god made the world.
01:56:17.471,01:56:21.892,"God makes us strong only for a while, so that we can help each other."
01:56:21.934,01:56:25.938,My god makes me strong so I can live my life!
01:56:28.148,01:56:31.485,"Arthur says to you, Serve one another."
01:56:31.526,01:56:34.696,"Well, when are you going to start living for yourselves?"
01:56:34.738,01:56:37.073,Now this is the freedom I bring you.
01:56:37.115,01:56:39.993,Freedom from Arthur's tyrannical dream.
01:56:40.034,01:56:42.704,Freedom from Arthur's tyrannical law.
01:56:42.746,01:56:45.791,Freedom from Arthur's tyrannical god.
01:56:48.084,01:56:51.672,I want your people to see you kneel before me here.
01:56:59.179,01:57:01.640,or die.
01:57:05.978,01:57:07.896,"Too proud, Arthur?"
01:57:07.938,01:57:10.315,You think you can better serve your people dead?
01:57:18.114,01:57:20.701,I have no pride left in me.
01:57:32.337,01:57:36.925,"What I do now, I do for my people and for Camelot."
01:57:37.634,01:57:39.636,And may they forgive me.
01:57:40.929,01:57:44.307,This is my last act as your king.
01:57:46.685,01:57:48.603,Do not be afraid.
01:57:53.608,01:57:55.569,All things change.
01:58:03.243,01:58:16.048,"I am Arthur of Camelot, and I command you now, all, to fight!"
01:58:16.089,01:58:18.592,Fight like you never fought before!
01:58:18.633,01:58:20.761,Never surrender!
01:58:20.802,01:58:22.804,Fight as you never...
01:58:24.138,01:58:25.181,No!
01:58:29.185,01:58:30.854,Camelot lives!
01:58:31.855,01:58:34.066,Burn it! Burn everything!
01:58:51.374,01:58:54.377,Fight! Fight for Camelot!
01:59:24.491,01:59:25.742,Come on!
01:59:30.831,01:59:33.875,Fight for King Arthur!
02:01:25.028,02:01:26.196,Sword!
02:01:49.343,02:01:50.720,"Please, no!"
02:02:18.748,02:02:20.208,You fool!
02:03:30.945,02:03:34.657,to the tyranny of Malagant!
02:03:39.704,02:03:40.997,Camelot.
02:04:07.982,02:04:09.609,Is there no more we can do?
02:04:09.650,02:04:10.860,I'm sorry.
02:04:25.208,02:04:26.459,Lancelot.
02:04:27.043,02:04:28.502,"Yes, milord?"
02:04:30.297,02:04:31.965,Where's my sword?
02:04:32.715,02:04:33.841,Here.
02:04:42.516,02:04:43.893,My truest.
02:04:44.936,02:04:46.562,My first knight.
02:04:48.106,02:04:50.150,Camelot is your home now.
02:04:52.568,02:04:54.321,You are the future.
02:04:55.571,02:04:57.698,The future of Camelot.
02:05:00.785,02:05:02.912,Take care of her for me.
02:05:04.456,02:05:06.416,Take care of her.
02:05:31.358,02:05:33.734,"I feel it now, my love."
02:05:37.280,02:05:38.781,The sunlight.
02:05:43.744,02:05:45.621,It's in your eyes.
