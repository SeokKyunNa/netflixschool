00:01:37.875,00:01:39.083,He stepped inside.
00:01:39.791,00:01:45.041,"A crucifix was still there, where the altar had been."
00:01:46.583,00:01:51.500,Francesco felt captivated.
00:01:52.125,00:02:02.375,"The crucifix spoke to him and said, “Francesco, repair my Church.” Francesco was a practical man."
00:02:02.458,00:02:13.333,"He went up to the quarry on Mount Subasio, cut stones, carted them down the mountain, and repaired the broken walls."
00:02:15.500,00:02:22.875,"Any journey, no matter how long, has to start somewhere."
00:02:23.958,00:02:29.416,"Any journey, no matter how glorious, can start with a mistake."
00:02:29.666,00:02:34.500,"So, when you feel lost, don’t worry."
00:02:35.416,00:02:38.125,God will not give up.
00:02:38.708,00:02:39.625,Understood?
00:02:40.875,00:02:42.291,Understood?
00:02:45.000,00:02:46.458,I’ve been thinking...
00:02:46.541,00:02:49.250,We have many troubles here.
00:02:51.083,00:02:56.375,It’s not fair to leave it all to Our Lady.
00:02:56.875,00:03:01.541,Who else could pray for us?
00:03:05.875,00:03:07.666,Let's see... Young man!
00:03:07.916,00:03:09.000,What’s your name?
00:03:10.541,00:03:13.000,"The name of my team, San Lorenzo!"
00:03:22.833,00:03:25.958,"San Lorenzo, pray for us..."
00:03:47.666,00:03:48.583,Father.
00:03:48.750,00:03:49.833,The Pope...
00:03:51.208,00:03:52.500,The Pope has died.
00:04:06.750,00:04:16.083,"Brothers and sisters, our beloved Holy Father John Paul II has returned to the Lord's house."
00:04:39.583,00:04:40.666,This?
00:04:40.958,00:04:44.000,"Archbishop of Kiev, Cardinal Husar."
00:04:44.083,00:04:44.916,Good.
00:04:45.166,00:04:46.041,This?
00:04:46.333,00:04:48.208,Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria.
00:04:48.375,00:04:50.708,Many say he will be the first African Pope.
00:04:51.083,00:04:52.500,Good. This?
00:04:54.625,00:04:56.250,"Bergoglio, Argentina."
00:04:56.750,00:05:01.291,Leading advocate for reform. Very popular in-- I know who he is.
00:05:01.375,00:05:02.208,This?
00:05:03.083,00:05:04.250,Cardinal Martini.
00:05:22.500,00:05:24.666,They will choose between tradition and reform.
00:06:07.833,00:06:09.000,Good afternoon.
00:06:18.250,00:06:21.750,The Church is too used to this glory.
00:06:22.000,00:06:23.125,This is Europe...
00:06:24.208,00:06:30.125,"Our churches are beautiful but empty, like a fire covered in ash."
00:06:30.208,00:06:33.125,We need someone to blow the ash away.
00:06:33.750,00:06:34.583,You.
00:06:34.875,00:06:37.708,Someone outside of Europe is better.
00:06:37.791,00:06:39.666,"No, Martini. Not me."
00:06:44.583,00:06:47.500,Thank you for the beautiful sermon.
00:06:47.958,00:06:49.708,You are welcome.
00:06:50.291,00:06:54.833,"Cardinal Hummes, life was easier when everybody spoke Latin."
00:06:54.916,00:06:55.916,Nice to see you.
00:07:01.833,00:07:05.833,"No nice to see you for you, Jorge."
00:07:43.625,00:07:45.958,The cardinals are about to vote.
00:08:53.375,00:08:59.166,"I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will judge me, that I elect the one who I deem..."
00:09:00.708,00:09:04.208,should be chosen according to God.
00:10:36.000,00:10:39.625,The results of the first scrutiny...
00:10:44.500,00:10:48.166,"Joseph Ratzinger, 47 votes."
00:10:49.458,00:10:52.625,"Jorge Bergoglio, ten votes."
00:10:54.666,00:10:56.583,Carlo Maria Martini...
00:10:58.041,00:10:59.458,Nine votes.
00:11:08.125,00:11:12.416,...no cardinal obtained the 77 votes needed.
00:12:35.916,00:12:37.333,The results...
00:12:38.041,00:12:40.416,of the third scrutiny...
00:12:41.833,00:12:50.000,are the following: It's white!
00:14:23.958,00:14:26.000,"Jorge, what will you do now?"
00:14:27.541,00:14:30.750,"Return to Buenos Aires, plan my retirement."
00:14:30.833,00:14:33.208,You're too young to retire.
00:14:34.708,00:14:39.958,The Church voted to make overdue reforms remain overdue.
00:14:40.833,00:14:46.458,I can do more good as a simple parish priest.
00:14:49.541,00:14:50.916,Okay.
00:14:55.125,00:14:56.791,I'll pray for him.
00:15:08.125,00:15:10.708,This protects the Doctrine of the Faith.
00:15:24.083,00:15:26.375,He's already started with no.
00:15:26.458,00:15:28.791,"No against this, no against that..."
00:15:29.666,00:15:34.041,It's bad for the poor in Brazil and the poor in the world.
00:15:34.125,00:15:39.500,People are abandoning Catholicism because it is too conservative.
00:16:02.916,00:16:04.041,"Bye, bye."
00:16:06.458,00:16:08.708,Don't buy Tonio's stamps.
00:16:09.166,00:16:10.541,They don't work.
00:16:11.375,00:16:13.625,There’s nothing wrong with them.
00:16:13.708,00:16:17.583,"I wrote a beautiful letter, and no reply."
00:16:18.625,00:16:22.250,"Sent it again, still no reply."
00:16:22.333,00:16:24.666,Your stamps don't work.
00:16:24.750,00:16:30.041,"Doesn't matter how good your letter was, Jorge, San Lorenzo will never call you."
00:16:33.458,00:16:35.791,Maybe you used the wrong address.
00:16:36.083,00:16:37.500,Impossible.
00:16:37.791,00:16:40.333,It’s a well-known address.
00:16:40.666,00:16:41.750,To whom?
00:16:42.666,00:16:43.708,The Pope.
00:16:45.458,00:16:49.250,"So, Tonio's stamps work."
00:16:49.708,00:16:52.875,"I have your letters, and this is from the Vatican."
00:16:56.333,00:16:58.041,Why the Pope?
00:16:58.125,00:16:59.416,I booked my flight.
00:17:00.875,00:17:01.750,Seriously?
00:17:02.583,00:17:05.041,What's so urgent?
00:17:07.333,00:17:08.791,You want to retire?
00:17:11.583,00:17:12.791,Don't do it.
00:17:14.166,00:17:16.916,We need you in Buenos Aires.
00:17:17.833,00:17:19.750,He wants me in Rome.
00:17:19.833,00:17:23.375,I booked my flight before this.
00:17:23.791,00:17:25.125,A coincidence...
00:17:25.416,00:17:27.541,There are no coincidences.
00:17:28.291,00:17:30.916,We are all in God's hands.
00:18:47.583,00:18:48.500,Good morning.
00:18:53.750,00:18:56.208,"-How are you? -Good, thank you."
00:20:03.041,00:20:07.666,"Yes. It's a private matter, so it's not in the official diary."
00:20:12.833,00:20:15.291,He is reading the report.
00:20:15.541,00:20:19.583,"Yes, his Holiness is aware."
00:20:19.833,00:20:22.083,I'll ask if he can speak to him.
00:20:23.041,00:20:24.416,Your Holiness.
00:20:24.500,00:20:26.750,Would you speak to Cardinal Bertone?
00:20:30.791,00:20:31.875,I have him here.
00:21:16.916,00:21:17.750,Where is he?
00:21:23.291,00:21:25.666,Looks like he's lived here all his life.
00:21:27.083,00:21:28.166,"Oregano, exactly."
00:21:29.250,00:21:32.291,My mother swore by oregano.
00:21:34.291,00:21:36.750,It makes everything taste good.
00:21:36.833,00:21:41.416,My mom mixes it with breadcrumbs.
00:21:41.500,00:21:43.500,-Me too. -Really?
00:21:43.666,00:21:44.625,Yes!
00:21:46.208,00:21:48.833,Everything the Pope eats comes from Gandolfo.
00:21:48.916,00:21:51.166,We send it to Rome. It's all organic.
00:21:51.250,00:21:52.583,"Vegetables, eggs, cheese."
00:21:54.333,00:21:55.458,Good morning!
00:38:10.375,00:38:11.416,180 tickets sold.
00:38:11.500,00:38:12.500,Great.
00:38:12.583,00:38:14.125,-Am I free? -Sure!
00:39:17.875,00:39:19.208,What are you doing?
00:39:21.083,00:39:23.916,"Jorge, these results are the same."
00:39:24.416,00:39:26.375,"Yes, same experiment."
00:39:26.458,00:39:28.583,What did we agree on?
00:39:30.083,00:39:33.875,"We have to test, test and test."
00:39:34.000,00:39:36.333,We live and die by facts.
00:39:36.833,00:39:37.916,Facts are...
00:39:39.000,00:39:40.375,You've had a haircut.
00:39:41.750,00:39:43.458,That is a fact.
00:39:44.458,00:39:46.166,And that shirt is new.
00:39:48.416,00:39:49.791,Also a fact.
00:39:51.250,00:39:52.666,You've decided?
00:39:53.708,00:39:56.166,You will propose!
00:39:56.958,00:39:58.416,That's speculation.
00:39:58.500,00:40:00.250,"No, a deduction."
00:40:00.333,00:40:02.375,An incorrect deduction.
00:40:04.250,00:40:05.833,I already asked.
00:40:06.583,00:40:08.666,Tonight we'll discuss the details.
00:40:09.333,00:40:11.250,"So, you won't be a priest."
00:40:11.875,00:40:14.458,"A logical conclusion, Esther."
00:40:15.458,00:40:17.041,What took you so long?
00:40:19.333,00:40:21.041,I had to listen to...
00:40:22.625,00:40:25.291,"you know, if He had other plans for me."
00:40:26.000,00:40:26.875,He?
00:40:30.875,00:40:34.333,This country doesn't need another priest.
00:40:34.750,00:40:36.291,I'll redo the tests.
00:40:36.833,00:40:39.583,"-Next time, don't fool me. -Promise."
00:40:41.083,00:40:42.250,Jorge!
00:40:42.500,00:40:44.416,You're going to be a great father.
00:40:50.666,00:40:52.125,You're beautiful!
00:40:52.666,00:40:54.083,The prettiest ones.
00:40:54.166,00:40:55.875,How do I look?
00:40:55.958,00:40:56.875,Very handsome!
00:41:47.291,00:41:48.333,Come in.
00:42:01.625,00:42:02.500,Come in.
00:42:05.333,00:42:07.166,"No, Father, I was just passing."
00:42:17.375,00:42:19.833,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
00:42:20.875,00:42:22.375,"I'm listening, my son."
00:42:22.583,00:42:25.208,"Before we start, may I ask you something?"
00:42:26.083,00:42:28.541,I haven’t seen you around. Where are you from?
00:42:28.750,00:42:30.583,Parque Patricios.
00:42:31.125,00:42:34.125,Sometimes I come here to give Mass.
00:42:34.250,00:42:37.708,I'm praying you’re not a Huracán supporter.
00:42:39.833,00:42:41.750,Your prayers have been answered.
00:42:43.625,00:42:47.208,I live close by in the priests’ home for the sick.
00:42:48.208,00:42:49.750,You tend to the sick.
00:42:50.125,00:42:52.666,No. I'm one of them.
00:42:53.083,00:42:54.125,I have cancer.
00:42:55.458,00:42:56.333,Leukemia.
00:42:59.166,00:43:00.958,"Then why are you here, Father?"
00:43:02.416,00:43:06.916,"I woke up this morning, the Lord asked me to hear confession."
00:43:07.375,00:43:08.583,But no one came...
00:43:09.875,00:43:11.541,until you.
00:43:15.166,00:43:16.541,What is troubling you?
00:43:19.208,00:43:20.666,"I'm listening, son."
00:43:21.333,00:43:23.416,"Some time ago, I asked for a sign."
00:43:24.458,00:43:25.625,Perhaps...
00:43:26.041,00:43:27.875,He's giving it now.
00:43:30.458,00:43:34.166,Maybe He wanted me here to speak with you.
00:43:37.083,00:43:38.458,With me?
00:43:42.791,00:43:46.291,Now you know our Father is watching.
00:43:47.208,00:43:48.958,You can confess.
00:43:50.333,00:43:52.000,Free your heart.
00:44:50.333,00:44:52.083,-Bergoglio. -Yes.
00:44:52.625,00:44:55.000,-Welcome home. -Thank you.
00:44:55.083,00:44:57.166,-How are you? -Good.
00:44:58.583,00:45:01.083,Do you know what you're saying no to?
00:45:01.166,00:45:02.666,-Yes. -Yes?
00:45:02.916,00:45:05.125,She even has a name.
00:45:05.375,00:45:06.958,"Oh, well."
00:45:07.041,00:45:10.416,You will have to learn to love her in another way.
00:45:11.291,00:45:12.916,Love has many faces.
00:45:14.750,00:45:18.166,It's a big mistake to think one can live without love.
00:45:18.916,00:45:20.500,I still have San Lorenzo.
00:53:46.375,00:53:50.458,"Cardinal, I have a souvenir for you."
00:53:52.250,00:53:54.708,-I made some cuttings. -Thank you!
00:53:56.125,00:53:57.833,"So, when you return home..."
00:53:57.916,00:53:59.000,Let me help you.
00:56:43.500,00:56:45.916,"Hey, Cardinal, need a lift?"
00:56:56.083,00:56:59.125,-How's the pizza? -Better when hot.
00:57:55.125,00:57:58.625,"Thank you, Lord, for Pipita's gift."
00:57:59.333,00:58:02.458,"Also, Lord, bless our Pope."
00:58:02.750,00:58:05.625,The German? Let him bless himself.
00:58:05.708,00:58:06.625,Nazi.
00:58:26.666,00:58:30.791,Let God grant him a quiet night and a peaceful end.
00:58:59.541,00:59:01.916,"Holy Father, he's not there."
00:59:03.416,00:59:04.875,What do you mean?
00:59:05.333,00:59:08.333,"We cannot find him. I sent a car, but he's not there."
00:59:10.083,00:59:10.958,Find him!
01:06:47.958,01:06:50.250,Silence incarnate!
01:10:02.125,01:10:11.833,People of Argentina: The country faces a hard moment in its history...
01:10:22.250,01:10:23.666,I remarried.
01:10:23.750,01:10:25.833,"In other words, you live with someone."
01:10:41.041,01:10:44.000,-What happened? -We want our children. Where are they?
01:10:54.791,01:10:59.125,We Argentinians say there are thousands and thousands...
01:10:59.208,01:11:04.291,"of mothers and families suffering in pain, anguish, and despair."
01:11:04.375,01:11:07.041,We don't know where our children are!
01:11:07.125,01:11:08.583,They say you lie.
01:11:08.666,01:11:09.958,We are lying?
01:11:10.375,01:11:13.291,That our children disappeared?
01:11:13.666,01:11:15.291,Where are they?
01:11:15.375,01:11:16.208,Cowards!
01:11:16.666,01:11:19.958,The so-called Christian Army have them!
01:11:26.291,01:11:28.583,Neither oppressors nor oppressed.
01:12:04.500,01:12:05.458,Father.
01:12:13.333,01:12:14.250,Admiral.
01:12:17.166,01:12:19.541,"Father Bergoglio, from the seminary."
01:12:19.625,01:12:21.833,-The seminary? -Nice to meet you.
01:12:21.916,01:12:25.708,Where Jesuits become Marxists through books.
01:12:26.625,01:12:28.958,He is with us and got rid of the books.
01:12:29.500,01:12:33.583,Maybe a priest took them to a mission.
01:12:35.375,01:12:37.291,It is a joke.
01:12:37.375,01:12:38.750,My chaplain is a Jesuit.
01:12:39.208,01:12:40.708,"I'm listening, Bergoglio."
01:12:40.791,01:12:44.000,"Hélder Câmara, Church and Development."
01:12:44.083,01:12:46.333,"Yankee Imperialism in Latin America, Olivares."
01:12:51.291,01:12:53.666,I didn't understand the call. What's happening?
01:12:53.750,01:12:56.791,"They are watching you, Esther. We need to clear the house."
01:12:58.291,01:12:59.416,Books...
01:13:00.375,01:13:01.541,pamphlets...
01:13:01.625,01:13:02.625,All of it.
01:13:03.500,01:13:05.583,Why the urgency?
01:13:05.666,01:13:06.708,Gramsci.
01:13:06.791,01:13:08.541,The Working Class. Peronism.
01:13:08.833,01:13:10.208,Brecht. Marx.
01:13:10.375,01:13:11.666,Psychoanalysis.
01:13:12.666,01:13:15.041,How do you know they're watching?
01:13:16.875,01:13:18.625,Who are you talking to?
01:13:22.625,01:13:25.041,See this guy protesting with you?
01:13:25.333,01:13:26.666,Gustavo.
01:13:26.875,01:13:27.708,No.
01:13:28.833,01:13:30.375,His name is Astiz.
01:13:31.791,01:13:34.458,Personal friend of Admiral Massera.
01:13:35.750,01:13:38.333,Otherwise known as the Blond Angel of Death.
01:13:39.250,01:13:40.666,An informer.
01:13:41.916,01:13:44.333,He’s a son of a bitch.
01:13:55.833,01:13:57.916,How long will you stay quiet?
01:14:00.000,01:14:01.541,Why don't you speak out?
01:14:02.416,01:14:04.833,Why don’t you speak out?
01:14:05.208,01:14:07.041,"If I speak, I can't help."
01:14:07.125,01:14:10.333,"No. If you spoke, you would be one more, like us."
01:14:10.458,01:14:13.458,You like to be the one in the admiral's palace...
01:14:13.541,01:14:14.541,making contacts.
01:14:15.125,01:14:16.166,Right?
01:14:55.208,01:14:56.458,I was his teacher.
01:14:56.541,01:14:59.083,Now he's head of the Jesuits in Argentina.
01:14:59.500,01:15:01.125,And Uruguay.
01:15:01.208,01:15:03.583,These are the guys learning skills.
01:15:03.666,01:15:05.875,Come meet the boys I mentioned.
01:15:06.958,01:15:08.500,They're real artists!
01:15:08.625,01:15:09.916,Jalics!
01:15:11.125,01:15:13.083,You need to close down Rivadavia.
01:15:16.666,01:15:17.541,What?
01:15:17.625,01:15:20.041,I need you to close this mission.
01:15:21.958,01:15:22.833,Yorio!
01:15:23.916,01:15:26.000,We didn't build this for nothing.
01:15:26.083,01:15:27.541,We can't abandon people.
01:15:27.625,01:15:31.583,"With Massera, if we haven't lost a Jesuit..."
01:15:31.666,01:15:34.041,It's because you didn’t speak out.
01:15:34.833,01:15:37.458,And made us irrelevant.
01:15:41.291,01:15:42.916,They’re watching...
01:15:43.000,01:15:45.125,and don’t like what they see.
01:15:45.208,01:15:47.041,I know!
01:15:49.708,01:15:51.875,-How? -What?
01:15:52.958,01:15:55.541,"How do you know that, Jorge?"
01:15:58.125,01:16:00.125,Did you go to President Videla's house?
01:16:01.750,01:16:03.250,To give communion?
01:16:07.041,01:16:08.833,"They are assassins, Jorge."
01:16:15.041,01:16:17.333,My role is to protect the Order.
01:16:18.875,01:16:21.708,That's our calling now? To protect ourselves?
01:16:22.583,01:16:24.625,I taught you...
01:16:25.333,01:16:26.958,How do we know Christ?
01:16:27.250,01:16:30.041,By following in his footsteps. Where do they lead?
01:16:30.125,01:16:30.958,Here.
01:16:31.041,01:16:33.250,Or before a firing squad!
01:16:33.333,01:16:35.416,"If that's so, so be it!"
01:16:37.041,01:16:38.958,I'm your superior.
01:16:39.291,01:16:42.875,I'm begging you to return to the seminary!
01:16:43.125,01:16:44.666,If we don't obey?
01:16:45.583,01:16:48.125,You are Jesuits. You made vows!
01:16:49.333,01:16:51.750,"Break them, and you're no longer Jesuits!"
01:16:51.833,01:16:55.000,"If we aren’t Jesuits, we lose protection."
01:16:55.458,01:16:57.375,It's like a death sentence.
01:16:57.458,01:17:00.125,So keep your vows. Damn it!
01:17:01.083,01:17:03.458,We refuse to cease our work.
01:17:04.416,01:17:06.875,You keep drinking tea with killers.
01:17:08.083,01:17:10.083,Listen to me!
01:17:10.166,01:17:12.916,I'll talk to whoever helps me save lives.
01:17:13.833,01:17:17.708,And you obey. Shut down the project!
01:17:18.875,01:17:20.291,It is an order.
01:17:22.791,01:17:25.250,You hear? It's an order!
01:17:52.916,01:17:55.000,I brought you some food...
01:18:10.791,01:18:12.416,It's an order!
01:19:00.208,01:19:01.750,Go home!
01:19:05.666,01:19:08.666,The Mass is over. Who's the priest?
01:19:09.583,01:19:10.708,Keep cool.
01:19:11.666,01:19:13.750,"Gentlemen, calm down, please."
01:20:16.416,01:20:17.333,Admiral.
01:20:17.750,01:20:18.583,The priest.
01:20:19.666,01:20:20.791,Come in.
01:20:30.875,01:20:32.166,Admiral.
01:20:32.250,01:20:33.291,I'm listening.
01:20:34.333,01:20:37.250,-You have my priests-- -Vilas' serve!
01:20:40.541,01:20:42.166,"He is good, right?"
01:20:43.458,01:20:48.875,"Admiral, you have my priests Jalics and Yorio..."
01:20:48.958,01:20:50.458,detained.
01:20:50.541,01:20:53.291,They are not political.
01:20:53.708,01:20:55.125,Why did you kick them out?
01:20:55.208,01:20:57.916,They were temporarily suspended.
01:20:58.000,01:20:59.875,A technical matter.
01:21:00.208,01:21:01.750,Who told you?
01:21:01.833,01:21:03.708,We see and hear everything.
01:21:04.250,01:21:05.958,Four months.
01:21:06.041,01:21:07.416,What are you doing to them?
01:21:07.500,01:21:08.791,"Enough, Bergoglio!"
01:21:08.875,01:21:11.666,I know full well where my priests are!
01:21:11.750,01:21:13.458,They're not your priests.
01:21:13.958,01:21:15.375,You just said so.
01:21:16.583,01:21:18.083,It's a technical matter.
01:21:21.208,01:21:25.125,You should think before you act.
01:24:12.458,01:24:16.666,God bless this food...
01:24:37.250,01:24:42.125,"NEW EVANGELISM FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EXCLUDED Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
01:24:42.208,01:24:46.125,I hate my former mother-in-law.
01:24:46.750,01:24:48.833,I want to kill her.
01:24:48.916,01:24:51.041,"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."
01:24:53.958,01:24:55.458,I have bad thoughts.
01:24:55.541,01:24:56.958,I masturbate many times a day.
01:24:57.041,01:24:58.708,"Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned."
01:24:58.791,01:25:00.791,I live in sin constantly...
01:25:01.625,01:25:03.666,...I feel very ashamed about it...
01:25:03.750,01:25:05.708,I'm always depressed.
01:25:05.791,01:25:08.000,...looking at them with sexual desire...
01:25:09.916,01:25:11.458,I feel I'm a fraud...
01:25:44.875,01:25:46.875,I had a TV.
01:25:50.333,01:25:51.958,I liked to watch football.
01:25:53.291,01:25:56.250,A TV needs an antenna and a signal.
01:25:57.958,01:26:00.625,Sometimes the signal is bad.
01:26:01.333,01:26:06.083,"We don't know why, but sometimes it doesn't work."
01:26:08.250,01:26:10.541,It's the same when we pray.
01:26:12.125,01:26:16.291,Sometimes the signal God sends us is strong and clear.
01:26:17.000,01:26:24.541,"It works fine. One feels the connection, that we are really plugged in, in direct contact."
01:26:26.375,01:26:28.458,But other days...
01:26:31.208,01:26:37.000,"one can only say, Well, at least I tried."
01:26:38.458,01:26:41.666,But you've gotten nothing back.
01:26:42.666,01:26:45.000,You don't have an answer.
01:26:48.416,01:26:52.750,"You say, Father, that doesn't happen to you."
01:26:53.958,01:26:57.125,"People believe that, for us, it's different..."
01:26:57.208,01:26:58.583,That we have...
01:26:59.583,01:27:01.250,a direct line with God.
01:27:03.791,01:27:05.250,"No, it's not like that."
01:27:05.791,01:27:08.916,"For us, it's the same as for you, and you..."
01:27:20.791,01:27:22.416,What I mean is...
01:27:27.541,01:27:29.833,"today, I'm not worthy of delivering a sermon."
01:27:32.291,01:27:36.333,My words would be empty.
01:27:41.083,01:27:43.500,"Today, you should teach me."
01:27:47.333,01:27:49.083,That would be the best.
01:28:34.750,01:28:39.000,You talk about tyranny! Your friends were tyrants!
01:28:39.083,01:28:41.583,They took away our companions!
01:28:41.666,01:28:43.750,You are an accomplice.
01:28:43.833,01:28:45.416,Friend of the military!
01:28:45.500,01:28:48.291,-Tell the truth! -Where are they?
01:28:48.583,01:28:51.041,-Where are they? -Where are they?
01:30:29.708,01:30:35.333,"How difficult it is to get out of ourselves sometimes, and stop being selfish."
01:30:36.166,01:30:42.625,"Because we think, I'll be an idol, be loved, be the Lord."
01:30:42.708,01:30:43.958,It's not like that.
01:30:44.041,01:30:46.166,There's only one Lord. Up there.
01:30:47.416,01:30:49.333,"So, I want you to pass the ball."
01:30:49.416,01:30:52.416,"Román, you have Lucas here. Look at him!"
01:30:53.750,01:30:54.833,Is it clear?
01:30:55.916,01:30:57.291,-Understood? -Yes.
01:30:57.375,01:30:59.000,-Understood? -Yes!
01:30:59.083,01:31:00.625,Let's play!
01:31:02.750,01:31:05.583,With heart and short passes!
01:31:06.750,01:31:08.541,Now you are playing as a team.
01:31:16.750,01:31:18.125,Nice to meet you.
01:31:18.250,01:31:20.458,It's a pleasure to listen to you.
01:32:55.333,01:32:59.708,"I absolve you in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
01:33:04.125,01:33:05.291,Holy Father.
01:33:05.375,01:33:07.916,It's nine o'clock. They are opening the doors to the public.
01:33:10.291,01:33:11.958,Would you like me to delay the opening?
01:34:06.416,01:34:10.708,"A margherita and diavola, two Fantas, and a coffee."
01:35:29.125,01:35:30.208,"Good, right?"
01:35:46.083,01:35:48.875,"Can you light the candles, please?"
01:35:49.291,01:35:51.000,"They're lit, Father."
01:35:57.333,01:36:00.125,Can you pass the stole? We're late.
01:36:03.041,01:36:08.208,"In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
01:36:08.791,01:36:09.625,Amen.
01:36:10.791,01:36:12.291,"Lord, wash me clean..."
01:36:12.833,01:36:17.375,"from my sins, so I can celebrate..."
01:36:19.000,01:36:22.666,these sacred mysteries.
01:36:26.958,01:36:34.875,"Now, let's give each other, everyone, a fraternal hug for peace."
01:48:09.166,01:48:10.416,What is it?
01:48:11.458,01:48:15.958,"When he has something tricky to say, he speaks Latin."
01:48:27.416,01:48:28.666,Did I hear right?
01:48:28.750,01:48:30.041,Not sure.
01:48:33.375,01:48:34.458,Did you get that?
01:48:35.833,01:48:37.333,Are you sure?
01:48:49.666,01:48:51.750,The Pope just renounced.
01:48:53.333,01:48:54.416,What?
01:51:19.666,01:51:21.708,Don't forget the poor.
01:51:40.291,01:51:41.958,You have a phone?
01:52:07.000,01:52:09.625,"Holy Father, sorry, no reply."
01:52:11.750,01:52:13.833,"Holy Father, you must choose."
01:52:15.166,01:52:17.250,I will wear what I am wearing.
01:52:23.125,01:52:24.250,The shoes?
01:52:25.208,01:52:27.708,They're part of a tradition from...
01:52:29.166,01:52:31.041,"No, mine are fine."
01:52:31.625,01:52:33.291,"Holy Father, the mozzetta?"
01:52:34.125,01:52:37.250,"No, thank you. The carnival is over."
01:52:56.500,01:53:01.500,"If there has to be tears, let’s make them tears of joy."
01:54:17.916,01:54:19.833,Brothers and sisters...
01:54:21.333,01:54:22.625,good evening.
01:54:28.125,01:54:29.958,You all know that...
01:54:30.375,01:54:32.291,the duty of the conclave...
01:54:33.041,01:54:36.208,was to give a bishop to Rome.
01:54:36.791,01:54:40.041,It seems that my cardinal brothers...
01:54:41.500,01:54:47.166,found one almost at the end of the world.
01:54:55.083,01:54:57.500,"Now, here we are."
01:55:01.666,01:55:09.500,"First of all, I'd like to say a prayer for our Bishop..."
01:55:09.916,01:55:12.958,Emeritus Benedict XVI.
01:55:23.500,01:55:26.833,Let's pray together for him.
02:02:08.375,02:02:10.416,Make sure to eat well!
00:00:17.166,00:00:19.291,"For flight information, please press one."
00:00:19.708,00:00:22.125,"If you're calling about a new booking, press two."
00:00:25.916,00:00:27.875,that our discount prices are Internet-only?
00:00:29.666,00:00:34.166,"-I'm looking to book a-- -If you still wish to speak to an operator, please press one."
00:00:42.500,00:00:45.541,I am looking for a flight from Rome to Lampedusa.
00:00:49.000,00:00:51.875,"but, uh, you know, I've only just moved here."
00:00:53.666,00:00:55.250,Bergoglio. Jorge Bergoglio.
00:01:21.250,00:01:22.291,in the woods.
00:01:25.041,00:01:28.083,His name was Francesco Bernardone.
00:01:30.041,00:01:32.625,"Suddenly, he found a chapel..."
00:02:17.875,00:02:19.458,no matter how long...
00:02:40.875,00:02:42.083,Understood?
00:03:07.750,00:03:08.791,What’s your name?
00:03:17.000,00:03:19.041,"No, no, no, no."
00:03:22.833,00:03:25.666,"San Lorenzo, pray for us..."
00:04:18.708,00:04:23.000,who fought for justice for the poor and reached out across all faiths for unity.
00:04:23.541,00:04:37.541,"But in sharp contrast, John Paul II's papacy also marked a clear end to liberalization and a return to the Church's harsh condemnation ...contraception, and the ordination of women and married men."
00:05:05.625,00:05:08.250,people are praying for cardinals in charge of electing the new pope.
00:05:09.750,00:05:13.041,the cardinals of the Catholic Church have gathered in Rome to elect a new pontiff...
00:05:13.375,00:05:18.625,"In Rome, 115 cardinals from 52 countries have been praying to elect a new pope."
00:05:20.541,00:05:22.416,"but, nonetheless, very political."
00:05:26.916,00:05:31.583,"between the German conservative, Joseph Ratzinger, and the Italian reformist, Carlo Martini."
00:05:34.250,00:05:37.208,and has long been considered the natural successor to John Paul II.
00:05:51.791,00:05:53.041,Dancing Queen.
00:05:55.916,00:05:57.041,By ABBA.
00:05:57.333,00:05:58.166,Ah!
00:06:11.500,00:06:13.458,Buona sera. Willkommen.
00:06:13.958,00:06:15.083,Benvenuti.
00:06:57.458,00:06:58.291,Ah.
00:07:06.250,00:07:07.083,No.
00:07:47.833,00:07:49.791,a formal procession into the Sistine Chapel...
00:07:51.708,00:07:54.250,with the outside world will be through that chimney.
00:07:54.333,00:07:55.875,White smoke means a new pope.
00:07:55.958,00:07:57.583,...black when there's no result.
00:08:10.583,00:08:13.250,The first ballot could be taking place right now.
00:08:15.416,00:08:17.833,...grand doors have slammed shut and will remain...
00:09:53.625,00:09:55.500,Martini Cardinalis.
00:10:02.250,00:10:04.250,Bergoglio Cardinalis.
00:10:09.166,00:10:11.125,Ratzinger Cardinalis.
00:10:25.416,00:10:28.500,Martini... Ratzinger... Bergoglio Cardinalis.
00:10:57.916,00:10:59.166,nine votes.
00:11:06.125,00:11:08.041,This means that no candidate has achieved...
00:11:19.166,00:11:20.166,has had so many before.
00:11:23.708,00:11:26.625,"So, it's 19 votes for a real change."
00:11:27.000,00:11:32.791,If he tells his followers to transfer their votes to you-- Reform needs a politician.
00:11:33.541,00:11:34.375,Hm?
00:11:34.666,00:11:38.541,Transfer your votes to Martini. He has worked for reform for years.
00:11:38.625,00:11:40.041,It's too late for that.
00:11:40.541,00:11:41.375,What?
00:11:47.375,00:11:48.416,"No, please."
00:11:48.583,00:11:52.083,The most important qualification for any leader is not wanting to be leader.
00:11:53.583,00:11:54.416,Plato.
00:11:57.125,00:11:57.958,So...
00:11:58.500,00:12:00.583,that's why it must not be Ratzinger.
00:12:01.875,00:12:03.125,He really wants it.
00:12:03.750,00:12:09.791,"I think the Church faces, uh, um, We need one common point of reference."
00:12:13.708,00:12:14.875,Only one unchanging...
00:12:17.333,00:12:21.333,You think he really wants it? Being pope is like being a martyr.
00:12:38.041,00:12:40.125,of the third scrutiny...
00:12:41.833,00:12:57.333,...are the following: That will be the words announced from that balcony up there.
00:13:16.291,00:13:17.416,Habemus Papam.
00:13:44.000,00:13:45.208,Ratzinger!
00:14:04.458,00:14:08.833,the election of Cardinal Ratzinger is actually a demonstration of the unity of the Church.
00:14:08.916,00:14:12.083,There weren't great divisions within the College of Cardinals.
00:14:12.166,00:14:16.000,That it was a fairly easy choice to go with Cardinal Ratzinger...
00:15:04.041,00:15:05.625,"He's, uh, an intellectual..."
00:15:14.333,00:15:16.833,"Well, I mean, he's-- he's going to stand up for dogma."
00:15:16.916,00:15:18.208,He's gonna be a great pope.
00:15:18.291,00:15:20.875,"Oh, my God, this is the best... I can't believe it."
00:16:17.666,00:16:18.541,Heh.
00:16:24.750,00:16:29.958,"Doesn't matter how good your letter was, Jorge, San Lorenzo will never call you."
00:16:45.458,00:16:46.458,So...
00:16:49.708,00:16:52.625,"I have your letters, and this is from the Vatican."
00:16:52.708,00:16:53.833,Gracias.
00:17:00.875,00:17:02.333,-Seriously? -Mm-hmm.
00:17:08.875,00:17:10.208,Eh... sí.
00:17:10.291,00:17:11.166,No!
00:17:13.208,00:17:14.083,Oh...
00:17:28.291,00:17:30.708,We are all in God's hands.
00:17:39.041,00:17:41.208,and the stunning accusation that's the talk of Rome.
00:17:42.583,00:17:46.208,Confidential Church documents were allegedly leaked to the press...
00:17:54.583,00:17:56.791,"the man who helped, is under arrest?"
00:18:05.083,00:18:06.750,...so he's fully aware of the issues...
00:18:51.625,00:18:53.625,"-Oh, Eminence, please-- -No, no, no, no, it's fine."
00:19:08.625,00:19:09.625,May I?
00:19:09.708,00:19:10.958,"-Oh, grazie. -Grazie."
00:19:12.250,00:19:14.166,"Oh, Eminence... E-Eminence..."
00:19:14.250,00:19:16.416,"No, no, I prefer to ride up front."
00:19:16.500,00:19:17.666,"-Grazie. -Oh, very well."
00:19:32.500,00:19:35.416,Oh. Summer residence. Ah.
00:19:36.708,00:19:38.625,Perhaps that's why he didn't get my letter.
00:19:44.333,00:19:46.500,and his cardinals like cardinals.
00:19:46.583,00:19:47.791,"Oh, really?"
00:19:48.333,00:19:50.541,Y-You have a spare cardinal's hat?
00:20:32.250,00:20:33.541,Ah. Grazie.
00:20:40.625,00:20:43.125,Ah. Does the Holy Father meet his cardinals here often?
00:20:50.083,00:20:52.833,"In Rome, one never knows what will happen next."
00:21:46.208,00:21:48.541,Everything the pope eats comes from Gandolfo.
00:21:52.916,00:21:54.250,"Ah, Santo Padre. Ah."
00:22:01.250,00:22:02.083,Ah...
00:22:09.708,00:22:13.291,"I wasn't the student you were, Holy Father."
00:22:13.375,00:22:15.166,"Please, not Latin."
00:22:21.791,00:22:23.875,I have to announce bad news to cardinals.
00:22:24.666,00:22:29.458,Only 20 percent of them... become angry as only 20 percent of them know what I have said.
00:22:32.833,00:22:35.166,I know you... value punctuality.
00:22:35.250,00:22:39.125,"Uh, Paolo, my last assistant, he would have made sure I got here on time."
00:22:44.916,00:22:45.750,Yeah.
00:22:49.708,00:22:51.541,Would you prefer to walk?
00:22:51.916,00:22:54.041,"-Well, that might not be wise. -Huh?"
00:22:54.541,00:22:55.916,Your shoelaces are undone.
00:23:04.375,00:23:07.875,You wrote to me asking for permission to retire as cardinal archbishop?
00:23:09.000,00:23:09.833,"Yes, uh..."
00:23:10.458,00:23:12.250,I have my papers here.
00:23:12.333,00:23:16.291,"Uh, cardinals are not required to ask for their retirement until they're 75."
00:23:16.541,00:23:17.375,Are you ill?
00:23:20.333,00:23:23.708,"but you were born with that, and it's not really troubled you since, has it?"
00:23:24.458,00:23:25.500,It's in your file.
00:23:28.458,00:23:30.250,So you don't have to be flattered.
00:23:34.500,00:23:35.916,"In fact, you're very active."
00:23:36.000,00:23:38.875,"You walk everywhere and, uh, sometimes use a bicycle."
00:23:40.833,00:23:41.958,Tango is dance?
00:23:43.958,00:23:45.875,Tango and football are compulsory.
00:23:45.958,00:23:48.416,"Of course, yeah. You dance with someone?"
00:23:48.541,00:23:51.416,"Uh, I-- One might look rather foolish dancing alone."
00:23:52.416,00:23:55.833,"So, for the sake of the dignity of my office, yes, with someone."
00:23:56.041,00:23:57.958,"Of course, that's good. Please."
00:24:06.375,00:24:11.208,"You've been one of my harshest critics, and there's a lot of competition for that title."
00:24:11.291,00:24:13.250,I've never spoken out against you.
00:24:13.333,00:24:14.750,"No, not directly, but, um..."
00:24:15.000,00:24:19.041,you refuse to live in the official palace of the cardinal archbishops.
00:24:19.125,00:24:21.250,"Sí, it's too grand. It's too big."
00:24:23.541,00:24:28.958,"By being so, um... pure and simple, you imply the rest of us are not living simply enough."
00:24:30.125,00:24:31.833,Can one ever...
00:24:35.250,00:24:37.250,"On, uh... married priests."
00:24:38.000,00:24:39.083,I was misquoted.
00:24:39.416,00:24:43.458,"I said, Celibacy can be a blessing. It can also be a curse."
00:24:43.541,00:24:44.958,Yeah. And on homosexuality?
00:24:45.041,00:24:54.875,All I said was-- Aha... But might I suggest you try telling the newspapers the opposite of what you think?
00:24:54.958,00:24:58.208,"Your chances of being quoted correctly might, therefore, improve."
00:25:00.416,00:25:04.583,Another thing: you openly give sacraments to those who are out of communion.
00:25:04.666,00:25:06.166,"To the divorced, for instance."
00:25:06.500,00:25:14.833,"Oh, I believe that giving communion is not a reward for the virtuous, it is food for the starving."
00:25:14.916,00:25:15.833,Ah.
00:25:16.250,00:25:20.458,"So, what matters is what you believe, but not what the Church has taught for hundreds of years?"
00:25:20.541,00:25:21.458,"No, no, no."
00:25:21.541,00:25:27.833,"Mark, chapter two, verse 17, I came to call sinners, as the Church has taught for thousands of years."
00:25:27.916,00:25:30.916,If we do not draw a line-- Or build walls to separate...
00:25:31.000,00:25:33.041,You talk about walls as if they are bad things.
00:25:33.125,00:25:35.500,-A house is built of walls. Strong walls. -Ah...
00:25:35.583,00:25:37.666,Did Jesus build walls?
00:25:38.083,00:25:39.916,His face is a face of mercy.
00:25:40.166,00:25:42.541,"The bigger the sinner, the warmer the welcome."
00:25:43.333,00:25:46.375,Mercy is the dynamite that blows down walls.
00:25:48.916,00:25:50.791,"You have an answer for everything, don't you?"
00:26:02.541,00:26:04.666,"You're very eloquent, you're very popular."
00:26:04.750,00:26:07.333,"If I allow you to resign, it will look like a protest."
00:26:07.666,00:26:12.250,"The Church being attacked from all sides, why would you want to abandon her to her enemies?"
00:26:12.333,00:26:15.083,Does a shepherd run away when the wolves appear?
00:26:15.166,00:26:16.666,I'm not running away.
00:26:17.333,00:26:20.083,I’ll take a parish. I’ll be a good shepherd to its people.
00:26:20.166,00:26:22.666,Don't you understand? You were almost elected pope.
00:26:22.958,00:26:25.166,"If you resign, it will look like a criticism."
00:26:25.833,00:26:28.583,The way you live is a criticism. Your shoes are a criticism.
00:26:35.083,00:26:37.166,It is dishonest and cynical.
00:26:37.250,00:26:39.000,Have enough respect to show me your real anger.
00:26:40.375,00:26:42.125,Do you think the Church is failing?
00:26:42.833,00:26:45.791,"-Well, we are losing people. -And that is the fault of the Church?"
00:26:45.875,00:26:52.041,"Not of... of... Western relativism, or permissiveness, or what do they say now? Oh, yes, Anything goes."
00:26:54.083,00:26:54.916,Yeah.
00:26:58.208,00:27:00.041,You said the Church is narcissistic.
00:27:00.125,00:27:02.583,"-Or was that another misquote? -No, no, I did say that."
00:27:03.250,00:27:14.833,"It seems to me that your Church-- -Oh. -...is moving in directions that I can no longer condone, or-- or not moving at all when the time demands movement."
00:27:17.208,00:27:19.083,I no longer wish to be a salesman.
00:27:21.708,00:27:23.375,A salesman for a product.
00:27:23.458,00:27:24.291,A product?
00:27:27.666,00:27:31.583,"-I cannot, in all conscience, endorse. -That you don't believe in?"
00:27:32.000,00:27:35.125,It seems to me that we are no longer part of this world.
00:27:35.208,00:27:36.750,We don't belong to it.
00:27:36.833,00:27:38.041,We are not connected.
00:27:40.125,00:27:53.208,"A Church that marries the spirit of the age-- When you were leader of the Jesuits in Argentina, you had all the books on Marxism removed from the library."
00:27:53.416,00:27:58.583,"And I made seminarians wear cassocks all day, even when they were working in the vegetable garden."
00:27:58.666,00:28:01.958,And I called civil marriage for homosexuals the Devil's plan.
00:28:05.708,00:28:06.541,I changed.
00:28:09.125,00:28:14.291,"-No, I changed. -Com-- It's a different thing."
00:28:29.833,00:28:31.250,Change is compromise.
00:28:35.750,00:28:38.875,"the life He gave us, is all change."
00:28:40.541,00:28:42.708,You are the successor to San Pietro.
00:28:43.750,00:28:45.541,San Pietro was married.
00:28:46.041,00:28:48.541,"Oh, thank you for letting me know. I had no idea."
00:28:50.625,00:28:54.041,We didn't ask priests to be celibate until the 12th century.
00:28:56.416,00:29:02.458,"No mention before the fifth century, and suddenly, angels are everywhere, like-- like pigeons."
00:29:03.458,00:29:08.625,"Nothing is static in nature or the universe, not even God."
00:29:09.166,00:29:11.166,God does not change.
00:29:11.250,00:29:12.625,"Yes, He does."
00:29:12.708,00:29:15.333,"-He moves towards us. -I am the way, the truth, and the life."
00:29:15.416,00:29:17.666,Where should we find Him if He's always moving?
00:29:18.625,00:29:19.666,On the journey?
00:29:22.250,00:29:23.750,This is your ego talking.
00:29:24.750,00:29:26.208,You think you know better.
00:29:26.375,00:29:27.583,I'm Argentinian.
00:29:27.875,00:29:30.208,-How does an Argentinian kill himself? -Ah?
00:29:30.291,00:29:33.458,He climbs to the top of his ego and jumps off.
00:29:44.875,00:29:46.625,I'm not familiar with this part of the garden.
00:29:46.708,00:29:47.833,Where are we?
00:29:50.333,00:29:52.583,"Maybe this way, where there is some shade?"
00:29:52.875,00:29:53.708,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:54.666,00:29:58.500,"Perhaps we'll find God over there, on the journey. I'll introduce you to Him."
00:30:00.833,00:30:06.625,"We defend 2,000 years of tradition, but Cardinal Bergoglio, he knows better."
00:30:06.708,00:30:15.625,"No, no. We have spent these last years disciplining anyone who disagrees with our line on divorce, on birth control, on being gay."
00:30:16.416,00:30:29.041,"While our planet was being destroyed, while inequality grew like a cancer, we worried about whether it was all right to speak the Mass in Latin, whether, uh, girls should be allowed to be altar servers."
00:30:29.500,00:30:36.458,"We built walls around us, and all the time, all the time, the real danger was inside, inside with us."
00:30:38.375,00:30:39.750,What are you talking about?
00:30:42.833,00:30:48.541,"We knew there were priests, bishops, great men of the Church who preyed on children."
00:30:48.625,00:30:50.708,-And what did we do? -We are addressing this.
00:30:50.791,00:30:56.291,"We heard their confession, then moved them on to another parish where they could start all over again."
00:30:57.125,00:31:05.625,"-We believed if they confessed-- -Oh, we believed it was better if nine children suffered than if nine million lost their faith because of a scandal?"
00:31:05.708,00:31:09.416,"-No, of course not. That is grotesque. -A bishop! A bishop said that to me!"
00:31:10.083,00:31:11.875,"Uh-huh, and how did you answer him?"
00:31:11.958,00:31:17.500,I told him to remove the priest from his ministry and initiate a canonical trial. Straight away.
00:31:20.583,00:31:24.541,I didn't believe a few magic words from the priest would make everything all right again.
00:31:24.625,00:31:27.083,Magic words? Is that how you describe the sacrament?
00:31:27.166,00:31:29.500,Confession cleans the sinner's soul.
00:31:29.583,00:31:31.208,It does not help the victim.
00:31:33.458,00:31:36.916,"Sin is a... a wound, not a stain."
00:31:37.500,00:31:39.708,"It needs to be healed, to be treated."
00:31:39.791,00:31:41.416,Forgiveness is not enough.
00:31:43.208,00:31:48.208,"You say we, -Holy Father. Please. -Your protest-- Listen to me."
00:31:49.500,00:31:54.041,"Your resignation is a protest against the Holy See, -and you're asking me to ratify it. -No, no."
00:31:54.125,00:31:56.958,You say you no longer wish to be cardinal archbishop.
00:31:57.041,00:31:59.791,"I ask you, are you sure you still wish to be a priest?"
00:32:11.625,00:32:13.458,I don't agree with anything you say.
00:32:45.541,00:32:47.541,"-Ah, thank you. -You're welcome."
00:32:48.166,00:32:51.000,The Holy Father has retired now until dinner.
00:32:51.083,00:32:53.208,-Uh-huh. -I'm to show you to your room.
00:32:53.458,00:32:54.458,My room?
00:32:54.541,00:32:55.375,Yes.
00:32:55.791,00:32:56.750,Come. Please.
00:32:58.250,00:32:59.083,"But, uh..."
00:33:23.791,00:33:26.916,But he has arranged for you both to eat the same meal.
00:33:35.500,00:33:39.541,"-Huh? -A typical Bavarian dish, Knödel mit Soße."
00:33:41.416,00:33:42.250,Well...
00:33:44.958,00:33:45.958,"Yes, I know."
00:34:05.916,00:34:08.833,"After dinner, sometimes, he comes here to relax."
00:34:13.416,00:34:14.250,Yeah.
00:34:23.041,00:34:24.333,Se posso...
00:34:24.416,00:34:25.416,Certo.
00:34:25.583,00:34:26.583,"Sì, grazie."
00:34:42.333,00:34:44.333,"You did 10,000 steps today."
00:34:48.375,00:34:52.416,"He said, You are in good shape for 86 but very bad shape for a human being."
00:34:53.041,00:34:54.458,I believe this was a joke.
00:35:03.250,00:35:05.458,I've never understood the excitement myself.
00:35:05.541,00:35:08.583,Really? Not even during the World Cup? Huh?
00:35:09.000,00:35:11.583,"You know, your national team and mine, we..."
00:35:12.166,00:35:14.333,we could be in the final together next year.
00:35:14.416,00:35:16.875,They could be a match for Argentina.
00:35:26.250,00:35:28.208,Please sit. Uh.
00:35:29.625,00:35:30.625,Holy Father...
00:35:32.000,00:35:35.041,"-I want you to look at my papers, please. -No, no, no..."
00:35:35.125,00:35:37.791,"-No, this is... But my papers, I really-- -No, no, no, no, no, please."
00:35:38.875,00:35:41.041,-this is the reason I'm here. -Nein.
00:35:42.750,00:35:44.791,"I know you like to talk, but I'm exhausted."
00:35:46.791,00:35:48.958,Let's just be quiet together. Please sit.
00:35:49.833,00:35:50.666,Good.
00:35:57.791,00:35:59.708,"-Would you like a tea or coffee? -No, thank you."
00:35:59.791,00:36:03.875,"I find if I drink coffee too late at night, I can't sleep."
00:36:13.958,00:36:14.875,Ah.
00:36:30.458,00:36:32.583,"You know, the hardest thing is to listen..."
00:36:34.250,00:36:35.500,to hear His voice.
00:36:38.291,00:36:39.333,God's voice.
00:36:42.291,00:36:43.708,"Sorry, even for a pope?"
00:36:44.708,00:36:46.458,But perhaps especially for a pope.
00:36:54.000,00:37:00.458,"You know, when I was a young man, hundreds of years ago, I always knew what He wanted of me. What God wanted, what..."
00:37:01.375,00:37:02.750,purpose He had for me.
00:37:04.541,00:37:05.500,But now...
00:37:07.750,00:37:08.750,I don't know.
00:37:14.958,00:37:16.875,"What do you think, Cardinal Bergoglio?"
00:37:25.500,00:37:26.333,Yeah.
00:37:28.125,00:37:29.333,"I think, perhaps, I need a..."
00:37:30.375,00:37:31.875,a spiritual hearing aid.
00:37:34.625,00:37:35.625,Who does know?
00:37:38.083,00:37:41.333,"You know, when I first heard that voice, whatever that was..."
00:37:42.541,00:37:43.875,"His voice, God's voice..."
00:37:47.333,00:37:48.583,...it brought me peace.
00:37:50.541,00:37:51.625,Such peace.
00:37:56.250,00:37:57.458,You must have felt that?
00:38:03.875,00:38:06.250,"Hmm. The call, yes."
00:38:07.000,00:38:07.875,The peace...
00:38:08.416,00:38:10.291,I wouldn't call it peace.
00:38:27.541,00:38:30.875,"Oh, I started to think about being a priest when I was a kid."
00:38:31.208,00:38:36.875,"I wasn't sure, so my grandmother said, Ask God for a sign."
00:38:36.958,00:38:38.041,Hola.
00:38:44.166,00:38:45.000,Nothing.
00:39:05.833,00:39:07.416,"So, I got on with life."
00:39:29.166,00:39:30.000,Hmm?
00:39:39.000,00:39:40.166,You've had a haircut.
00:39:53.708,00:39:56.125,You will propose!
00:40:15.458,00:40:16.750,What took you so long?
00:40:19.500,00:40:20.791,I had to listen to...
00:40:42.583,00:40:44.166,You're going to be a great father.
00:40:56.958,00:40:57.958,"Bueno, muchas gracias."
00:42:05.333,00:42:06.916,"No, Father, I was just passing."
00:42:22.666,00:42:24.791,"Before we start, may I ask you something?"
00:42:34.250,00:42:37.666,I'm praying you’re not a Huracán supporter.
00:42:48.208,00:42:49.458,You tend to the sick.
00:42:50.125,00:42:52.291,No. I'm one of them.
00:43:02.416,00:43:07.250,"I woke up this morning, the Lord asked me to hear confession."
00:43:09.875,00:43:11.125,until you.
00:43:19.208,00:43:20.333,"I'm listening, son."
00:43:21.333,00:43:23.125,"Some time ago, I asked for a sign."
00:43:26.041,00:43:27.666,He's giving it now.
00:43:47.083,00:43:48.625,You can confess.
00:43:50.333,00:43:51.791,Free your heart.
00:44:55.083,00:44:56.958,-How are you? -Good.
00:45:02.916,00:45:04.791,She even has a name.
00:45:05.375,00:45:06.625,"Oh, well."
00:45:07.041,00:45:10.291,You will have to learn to love her in another way.
00:45:10.375,00:45:11.208,Hm?
00:45:11.291,00:45:12.791,Love has many faces.
00:45:14.750,00:45:17.958,It's a big mistake to think one can live without love.
00:45:19.083,00:45:20.375,I still have San Lorenzo.
00:45:23.958,00:45:26.625,"That priest, that day, me finding him there."
00:45:30.250,00:45:32.625,God would have found another way to call me.
00:45:33.041,00:45:34.666,You have such certainty.
00:45:36.583,00:45:39.458,And I'm certain... He wants me to retire.
00:45:40.833,00:45:48.083,"I know we have our differences, our disagreements, but, please, this evening, let's be... simply brothers together, shall we?"
00:45:51.833,00:45:53.833,Do you play the piano or any instrument?
00:45:53.916,00:45:55.541,"No. No, but I know you do."
00:45:56.500,00:45:58.375,"You, uh... you made an album."
00:45:58.916,00:46:01.583,"Uh, Music from the Vatican: Alma Mater."
00:46:01.833,00:46:05.208,"That's right, I did. Heh. Have you a copy of the album?"
00:46:08.625,00:46:10.875,Ah. I could sign it for you.
00:46:12.458,00:46:13.791,"Yes, please."
00:46:15.416,00:46:18.125,Perhaps you could play something now.
00:46:19.708,00:46:22.166,"Well, I-- I'm a bit out of practice, but..."
00:46:25.500,00:46:32.166,"Now, this little piece by Bedřich Smetana, my favorite Czech, and, uh, it's a lullaby."
00:47:46.791,00:47:49.916,this album was recorded in a-- a famous studio in London.
00:47:52.916,00:47:54.458,because the Beatles had been there.
00:48:15.750,00:48:18.541,"Um... Yes, I-- I can't remember where the..."
00:48:19.500,00:48:20.750,"studio was, it was a..."
00:48:20.958,00:48:23.000,"But, uh, it was like a church or something."
00:48:24.583,00:48:28.083,"-Abbey, the Abbey? Yes, the road. -Abbey Road. You went to Abbey Road?"
00:48:28.166,00:48:30.750,"No, no, no. It would not have been appropriate."
00:48:36.041,00:48:38.750,"I once thought I had a calling for music, but, uh..."
00:48:38.958,00:48:39.833,"I'm afraid, um..."
00:48:40.625,00:48:42.458,"at the keyboard, I'm not infallible."
00:48:42.958,00:48:44.291,But I enjoy it.
00:48:51.500,00:48:52.500,You like?
00:48:54.708,00:48:56.125,It's... very different.
00:48:56.875,00:48:57.875,It's wonderful.
00:49:03.291,00:49:45.500,It was made famous on the radio before the war It's good wine?
00:49:46.541,00:49:47.541,Granados.
00:49:59.791,00:50:00.666,Ah...
00:50:01.791,00:50:03.208,The signal is not good here.
00:50:08.416,00:50:09.250,Yes.
00:50:27.000,00:50:33.166,"It's a television program from Austria, and, uh, a German shepherd dog who solves crimes, and, uh..."
00:50:34.791,00:50:37.000,...the trouble he gets into.
00:50:37.083,00:50:39.708,The trouble he gets into every week.
00:50:41.625,00:50:43.166,It takes my mind off things.
00:50:43.833,00:50:44.875,Ah.
00:50:45.708,00:50:47.125,"You know something, I'll tell you."
00:50:47.541,00:50:52.458,"Here, in this place, they call me God's Rottweiler, guarding the house of God."
00:50:52.541,00:50:56.041,"They don't know I-- I know, but... So I never say anything."
00:51:00.875,00:51:02.958,"Well, small pleasures are important."
00:51:06.541,00:51:09.541,the two seminarians who-- who liked to smoke?
00:51:09.833,00:51:20.500,"No. They should resist the temp-- Well, yeah, yeah. So, the first one, he goes to his spiritual director, and he says, Father, is it permitted to smoke while praying?"
00:51:20.833,00:51:23.583,"And the director says, No. No, of course not."
00:51:23.666,00:51:25.583,"-Of course not. No, it's-- -No, no. So..."
00:51:25.666,00:51:27.708,"So, the second one, he was a Jesuit."
00:51:27.791,00:51:32.958,"He says to his friend, Brother, you're just asking the wrong question."
00:51:33.041,00:51:40.083,"-Ah. -So he goes to the director, then he says, Father, is it permitted to pray while smoking?"
00:51:43.666,00:51:58.708,Pray and smoke at the same ti-- Pray and smoke at the same time. It's impossible.
00:52:04.250,00:52:07.375,Remembering jokes is an essential part of Jesuit training.
00:52:09.291,00:52:10.500,Yeah.
00:52:12.458,00:52:13.291,Yes.
00:52:14.333,00:52:15.458,I like company.
00:52:20.333,00:52:22.583,"Isaiah 41, chapter 10."
00:52:23.041,00:52:25.666,"Yeah. Do not be afraid, for I am with you, always."
00:52:27.333,00:52:28.166,Yeah.
00:52:30.416,00:52:31.833,I know He's here...
00:52:33.375,00:52:34.583,but He doesn't laugh.
00:52:35.541,00:52:38.875,"At least, I don't hear Him laughing. You know?"
00:52:41.583,00:52:42.750,"No, you wouldn't know."
00:52:44.083,00:52:45.041,Someone like you...
00:52:45.625,00:52:48.583,would never understand what I... mean.
00:52:57.291,00:52:58.291,It's been a long day.
00:52:59.375,00:53:00.333,Gute Nacht.
00:53:00.416,00:53:01.416,-Yeah. -Yes.
00:53:28.666,00:53:29.958,"Good morning, Eminence."
00:53:30.333,00:53:31.583,"Ah, good morning."
00:53:31.666,00:53:35.875,"The Holy Father apologizes, but he's been called back to Rome."
00:53:36.166,00:53:37.291,Urgent business.
00:53:38.375,00:53:40.583,If you can get ready as soon as possible.
00:54:38.750,00:54:39.875,Oh! Oh!
00:54:47.708,00:54:51.000,I hope this urgent business is not too distressing.
00:54:52.583,00:54:54.208,"Oh, the Curia is like a machine."
00:54:54.333,00:54:56.958,"You put your hand inside, it chops it into mincemeat."
00:54:57.041,00:54:58.583,They always defend themselves.
00:54:59.291,00:55:02.750,Sometimes it feels like being pope is to become breakfast.
00:55:03.875,00:55:05.541,"What is that plant? Is that, uh..."
00:55:07.708,00:55:08.833,It's oregano.
00:55:09.541,00:55:11.083,Your gardener gave it to me.
00:55:11.875,00:55:14.166,"Oh, yes. You're very popular."
00:55:18.416,00:55:20.291,I just try to be myself.
00:55:22.125,00:55:25.500,"Whenever I try to be myself, people don't seem to like me very much."
00:55:26.208,00:55:29.250,"Also, there's no option, since I'm obliged to be pope."
00:55:33.500,00:56:26.375,"Holy Father, about my retirement-- but first, he must deal with an urgent matter."
00:56:31.166,00:56:34.083,"You can talk to him tomorrow at seven, okay?"
00:57:08.333,00:57:14.750,after Gianluigi Nuzzi released his book entitled His Holiness: The Secret Letters of Benedict XVI.
00:57:14.833,00:57:20.500,"The book consists of documents, letters, and memoranda between the pope and his personal secretary."
00:57:20.875,00:57:27.208,"It has sent shock waves through the Vatican and brought Pope Benedict back to Rome from Castel Gandolfo, his summer residence."
00:57:49.625,00:57:50.791,Bueno.
00:57:58.291,00:57:59.250,Amen.
00:58:02.750,00:58:05.333,The German? Let him bless himself.
00:58:08.333,00:58:09.541,No.
00:58:55.000,00:58:55.833,Sì?
00:59:03.416,00:59:04.541,What do you mean?
00:59:25.666,00:59:27.291,"it must be very uncomfortable, huh?"
00:59:27.375,00:59:28.291,Very hot.
00:59:35.208,00:59:37.750,Or perhaps someone cleans it for you?
00:59:53.791,00:59:54.666,Grazie.
01:01:12.708,01:01:13.541,"No, uh..."
01:01:14.666,01:01:15.958,"visitors, no tourists."
01:01:22.833,01:01:23.708,"Ah, Padre."
01:01:24.333,01:01:27.291,"-Yeah. -If I was pope, I'd be in here every day."
01:01:27.541,01:01:29.291,"-Yeah, what else? -What?"
01:01:29.958,01:01:32.500,"Well, if you had been chosen, what would you do?"
01:01:33.750,01:01:35.458,"This place would be different, I think. Huh?"
01:01:40.958,01:01:44.000,"Aside from the theology, -it's no good for you. -Oh."
01:01:44.166,01:01:49.500,"You know, Jesus was always breaking bread -and feeding people. -Well, what else?"
01:01:50.916,01:01:52.000,"Well, I'd, uh..."
01:01:52.291,01:01:53.625,I'd sort out the Bank.
01:01:57.041,01:02:00.250,"Yeah, well, the banks almost destroyed my country."
01:02:00.375,01:02:01.291,Yeah.
01:02:01.375,01:02:05.750,"You know, they beg for deregulation, like tigers begging to be let out of a cage."
01:02:09.875,01:02:11.041,It's new elitism.
01:02:11.125,01:02:12.083,Hm.
01:02:15.666,01:02:18.000,You're beginning to be happy I'm going to retire.
01:02:22.500,01:02:24.125,"For many weeks now, I've been..."
01:02:25.250,01:02:27.000,"well, I've been praying for a sign."
01:02:28.291,01:02:29.541,I don't understand.
01:02:34.916,01:02:41.666,"when your request came to me to retire as cardinal archbishop, I could not accept it, your retirement, I mean, until I'd, um..."
01:02:42.750,01:02:43.750,spoken to you.
01:02:44.958,01:02:48.000,"So, you had to come from Argentina to Rome to see me."
01:02:48.666,01:02:49.666,"And, uh..."
01:02:50.291,01:02:53.625,"what I'm saying is, perhaps you had to come here for some other purpose."
01:02:54.083,01:02:55.083,Like what?
01:02:56.208,01:02:57.041,Well...
01:02:59.375,01:03:00.541,"you see, I've made a..."
01:03:01.416,01:03:05.875,"a decision, an important decision, I think, for the life of the Church and for her future."
01:03:06.541,01:03:09.500,Something I ask you to hide in your soul and speak of to no one.
01:03:09.583,01:03:10.916,-Uh-huh. -Know what I mean?
01:03:11.000,01:03:11.916,-Sí. -Good.
01:03:14.416,01:03:15.708,"You know, sometimes..."
01:03:17.791,01:03:20.583,"sometimes, you notice little things. It's very strange."
01:03:25.250,01:03:30.458,"You know, the other night, after... prayer, I put out the candle, and uh..."
01:03:33.958,01:03:35.208,instead of rising up...
01:03:36.458,01:03:43.500,"the smoke went down, like Cain's offering being rejected Do you notice such things?"
01:03:45.583,01:03:46.458,Uh...
01:03:52.500,01:03:54.791,...before you requested my presence.
01:03:56.000,01:03:57.500,-No. -Yes!
01:04:07.458,01:04:08.291,Yeah...
01:04:09.916,01:04:12.208,You're the right person. I'm going to resign.
01:04:12.291,01:04:13.666,-This marble is cold here. -Sorry...
01:04:17.375,01:04:18.375,To tell what?
01:04:18.875,01:04:20.916,What I just said. I'm going to resign.
01:04:22.375,01:04:24.041,"Uh, resign from what?"
01:04:26.375,01:04:27.625,The Chair of Saint Peter.
01:04:27.958,01:04:29.208,The Bishopric of Rome.
01:04:43.250,01:04:44.291,Popes can't resign!
01:04:44.791,01:04:46.208,It's not without precedent.
01:04:47.041,01:04:50.000,"Celestine V resigned, 1294."
01:04:50.583,01:04:51.666,Didn't you know that?
01:04:52.250,01:04:58.208,"Holy Father, you think-- you think people will not be shocked because this happened once before, 700 years ago?"
01:05:00.750,01:05:03.708,I-- I came here just to have you sign a piece of paper.
01:05:08.833,01:05:11.750,Now you know why I could not grant you your wish to retire.
01:05:11.833,01:05:14.458,It would be another conclave. It is important that you're there.
01:05:14.541,01:05:17.250,"Holy Father, you must not do this. You cannot do this."
01:05:19.458,01:05:23.875,Why do the presidents of America and Russia and China come to you?
01:05:23.958,01:05:24.958,Because...
01:05:25.791,01:05:32.208,"unlike them, your authority comes from the fact that you will suffer and die in the job."
01:05:34.333,01:05:35.541,to justice and truth.
01:05:35.916,01:05:37.333,"For this, all people come."
01:05:37.416,01:05:38.708,"Forgive me, but..."
01:05:42.208,01:05:43.041,But?
01:05:43.583,01:05:46.666,Christ did not come down from the cross.
01:05:46.791,01:05:49.791,Ah! God always grants you the right words.
01:05:52.416,01:05:55.541,Be the personification of the crucified Christ.
01:05:57.125,01:05:59.708,"If you do this, you will damage the Papacy forever."
01:06:03.000,01:06:04.916,And what damage will I do if I remain?
01:06:12.083,01:06:14.250,It's-- It's... two popes?
01:06:17.291,01:06:19.041,"Well, in 1978, we had three popes."
01:06:21.208,01:06:22.791,I was making a little joke.
01:06:24.166,01:06:26.541,A German joke. It doesn't have to be funny.
01:06:32.500,01:06:34.916,corrects one pope by presenting the world with another pope.
01:06:35.000,01:06:37.166,I should... I'd like to see my correction.
01:06:43.083,01:06:44.958,Only one would command authority.
01:06:45.208,01:06:47.458,"I would, uh, hide away, out of the spotlight."
01:06:54.833,01:06:55.750,"No, no, no."
01:06:55.916,01:06:58.333,"If there was pressure from there, I would resist."
01:06:58.750,01:07:01.166,"No, I know my intentions and my motives are pure."
01:07:06.041,01:07:07.125,-Keep moving. -Yeah.
01:07:08.833,01:07:10.125,"And besides, I, um..."
01:07:20.791,01:07:21.791,"And, uh..."
01:07:22.708,01:07:24.875,governance requires eyes that I do not have.
01:07:25.833,01:07:26.666,Yes...
01:07:28.208,01:07:30.166,I've struggled and fought to do what...
01:07:38.083,01:07:41.291,It is our weakness that calls forth the grace of God.
01:07:41.833,01:07:44.625,"You show your weakness, He gives us strength."
01:07:46.500,01:07:48.333,I've given you my answer.
01:07:48.750,01:07:49.750,Be satisfied.
01:07:50.500,01:07:52.166,"With respect, Holy Father..."
01:07:53.166,01:07:55.875,it's not me who needs to be satisfied.
01:07:56.125,01:07:59.416,It's 1.2 billion believers.
01:07:59.833,01:08:01.083,They'll need to know why.
01:08:01.291,01:08:04.708,"Otherwise, they'll think there is a scandal, a... a plot."
01:08:05.458,01:08:07.250,"Well, that is the calculation of leadership."
01:08:10.958,01:08:12.208,Both? Why?
01:08:12.583,01:08:19.125,"Well, for months, I've been, uh, wanting to resign, but there was one thought that prevented me from that."
01:08:19.208,01:08:24.833,"I thought, What if at the next conclave, they voted for that, uh, Cardinal Bergoglio?"
01:08:24.916,01:08:25.875,For you.
01:08:31.041,01:08:32.041,As I said...
01:08:32.750,01:08:39.041,"what prevented me from resigning was the thought that, uh, they could've chosen you, or elected you."
01:08:39.875,01:08:44.958,"But now you are here in Rome to see me, -and now, I've changed. -You've compromised."
01:08:45.041,01:08:46.250,"No, I've changed."
01:08:47.125,01:08:48.583,Compromise is something else.
01:08:49.916,01:08:53.458,Your style and your methods are entirely different to mine.
01:08:53.708,01:08:58.000,"I don't agree with any-- well, most of the things you say, think, or do, but, uh..."
01:08:58.250,01:09:02.666,"for some strange reason, now I can see a..."
01:09:04.583,01:09:06.416,a necessity for a Bergoglio.
01:09:07.541,01:09:12.833,"But I cannot do this without knowing that there is, at least, -a possibility that you might be chosen. -No."
01:09:14.750,01:09:16.541,It could never be me.
01:09:16.625,01:09:17.458,All right.
01:09:19.208,01:09:25.208,"You cannot retire from the Church unless I agree to your going, and I cannot resign until you agree to stay."
01:09:26.125,01:09:28.041,It's a conundrum. A theological conundrum.
01:09:28.125,01:09:30.583,You don't understand. It could never be me.
01:09:30.666,01:09:33.041,We know in our heart of hearts that it could be.
01:09:33.166,01:09:36.041,"The Church needs to change, and you could be that change."
01:09:50.458,01:09:51.500,You know why.
01:09:52.583,01:09:53.875,I've read your files.
01:09:56.666,01:09:59.208,The files... are incomplete.
01:10:13.833,01:10:17.333,the government was overthrown by a military dictatorship.
01:10:17.791,01:10:21.500,"At that time, I became the head of Jesuit priests in Argentina."
01:10:47.833,01:10:49.583,"Esther, my old boss."
01:10:50.333,01:10:51.333,My friend.
01:10:52.291,01:10:53.625,Her daughter was among them.
01:11:24.041,01:11:26.375,as supporters of the armed resistance.
01:11:35.541,01:11:38.250,...was martyred in 1974.
01:11:56.625,01:11:59.416,I felt my job was to make sure my priests were safe.
01:12:07.083,01:12:09.291,one of the leaders of the junta.
01:12:26.666,01:12:29.375,-He is with us and got rid of the books. -Hm.
01:12:29.500,01:12:33.416,Maybe a priest took them to a mission.
01:13:01.625,01:13:02.500,All of it.
01:13:16.875,01:13:18.208,Who are you talking to?
01:13:22.625,01:13:24.875,See this guy protesting with you?
01:13:25.333,01:13:26.458,Gustavo.
01:13:28.833,01:13:30.208,His name is Astiz.
01:13:31.791,01:13:34.208,Personal friend of Admiral Massera.
01:13:35.791,01:13:38.041,Otherwise known as the Blond Angel of Death.
01:13:41.916,01:13:44.083,He’s a son of a bitch.
01:13:55.833,01:13:57.791,How long will you stay quiet?
01:14:00.041,01:14:01.291,Why don't you speak out?
01:14:02.416,01:14:04.500,Why don’t you speak out?
01:14:07.125,01:14:09.916,"No. If you spoke, you would be one more, like us."
01:14:10.500,01:14:13.250,You like to be the one in the admiral's palace...
01:14:15.125,01:14:16.041,Right?
01:14:37.458,01:14:39.833,That was the last time I ever saw her.
01:14:42.375,01:14:50.375,"She warned me, I would not have made the mistakes that I made."
01:15:01.208,01:15:03.541,These are the guys learning skills.
01:15:03.666,01:15:05.833,Come meet the boys I mentioned.
01:15:17.625,01:15:19.583,I need you to close this mission.
01:15:27.625,01:15:33.750,"With Massera, if we haven't lost a Jesuit-- It's because you didn’t speak out."
01:15:34.833,01:15:37.083,And made us irrelevant.
01:15:43.000,01:15:44.916,and don’t like what they see.
01:16:07.041,01:16:08.541,"They are assassins, Jorge."
01:16:15.166,01:16:16.875,My role is to protect the Order.
01:16:27.250,01:16:28.416,By following in His footsteps.
01:16:33.333,01:16:35.166,"If that's so, so be it!"
01:16:39.291,01:16:42.541,I'm begging you to return to the seminary!
01:16:43.125,01:16:44.416,If we don't obey?
01:16:51.833,01:16:54.666,"If we aren’t Jesuits, we lose protection."
01:16:57.458,01:16:59.916,So keep your vows. Damn it!
01:17:04.416,01:17:06.458,You keep drinking tea with killers.
01:17:10.166,01:17:12.625,I'll talk to whoever helps me save lives.
01:17:12.875,01:17:13.750,Mm-hmm.
01:17:18.875,01:17:20.041,It is an order.
01:17:30.958,01:17:32.875,Questioned my authority.
01:17:40.958,01:17:44.625,"You talk about, uh... your authority. What did you do with that authority?"
01:17:51.500,01:17:52.500,It's in your file.
01:17:57.541,01:17:58.666,in the seminary.
01:17:59.041,01:18:02.000,You even drove some of them up to the border yourself.
01:18:04.375,01:18:07.083,"No. No, not for your..."
01:18:08.041,01:18:10.250,"brother Jesuits, no."
01:18:19.500,01:18:21.708,Their right to say Mass was removed.
01:18:21.916,01:18:24.625,"And with it, the protection of the Church."
01:18:28.875,01:18:30.958,I was supposed to protect them.
01:18:31.500,01:18:32.416,I failed.
01:19:50.083,01:19:54.875,I know He has a very special capacity for forgetting our mistakes.
01:19:55.666,01:19:58.208,"God forgets, but I don't."
01:20:04.833,01:20:07.375,They were taken away and tortured for months.
01:20:09.416,01:20:11.000,Their hands were broken.
01:20:28.708,01:20:29.583,Bergoglio.
01:21:32.166,01:21:33.291,It was empty.
01:21:46.166,01:21:48.250,take away our freedom to choose.
01:21:48.541,01:21:49.625,We both know that.
01:22:15.458,01:22:38.500,"There were so many bodies washed up on the shore, My dear friend..."
01:22:41.625,01:22:42.625,And where was I?
01:22:46.750,01:22:48.416,Where was Christ in all this?
01:22:49.750,01:22:52.541,Was he taking tea in the presidential palace?
01:22:53.958,01:22:58.291,"Or was he being tortured in prisons, with Yorio and Jalics?"
01:23:01.500,01:23:03.958,"Well, perhaps the path appears straight when we..."
01:23:04.541,01:23:05.500,look back at it.
01:23:07.541,01:23:09.625,"On the way, we often feel lost."
01:23:12.541,01:23:15.250,The dark night of the soul. Hm.
01:23:18.375,01:23:19.291,Hm.
01:23:23.916,01:23:26.583,"and democracy returned, your order turned on you."
01:23:32.500,01:23:37.958,"removed from your position, stripped of all authority, sent abroad."
01:24:00.708,01:24:05.166,"of having sinned by doing too little, of being egotistical."
01:24:06.166,01:24:09.375,"You were sent to the mountains, exiled."
01:24:30.500,01:24:31.916,of dark days and nights.
01:25:50.333,01:25:51.666,I liked to watch football.
01:25:53.291,01:25:55.958,A TV needs an antenna and a signal.
01:25:57.958,01:26:00.375,Sometimes the signal is bad.
01:26:08.166,01:26:10.166,It's the same when we pray.
01:26:12.125,01:26:16.375,Sometimes the signal God sends us is strong and clear.
01:26:42.666,01:26:44.666,You don't have an answer.
01:27:03.791,01:27:05.041,"No, it's not like that."
01:27:27.541,01:27:29.791,"today, I'm not worthy of delivering a sermon."
01:27:41.083,01:27:43.208,"Today, you should teach me."
01:27:47.333,01:27:48.833,That would be the best.
01:28:26.708,01:28:30.541,...but a new tyranny rises up.
01:28:31.291,01:28:34.666,"Not just here, but around the world."
01:28:57.583,01:29:00.166,not just of repression...
01:29:00.791,01:29:02.166,and oppression...
01:29:02.958,01:29:03.958,or terror.
01:29:04.750,01:29:08.041,A tyranny of unfair economic structures...
01:29:09.916,01:29:12.708,that create huge inequalities.
01:29:14.416,01:29:29.791,"You know, 20 percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive."
01:29:36.333,01:29:54.375,"Thou shalt not kill sets a clear limit so to safeguard the value of human life, so today, we also have to say, Thou shalt not to an economy of exclusion..."
01:29:56.083,01:30:00.250,and inequality which idolizes money.
01:30:04.958,01:30:06.666,Every community...
01:30:07.541,01:30:10.916,is called to be an instrument for the liberation...
01:30:12.333,01:30:17.041,the liberation and promotion of the poor.
01:30:42.708,01:30:43.666,It's not like that.
01:30:44.166,01:30:45.875,There's only one Lord. Up there.
01:30:47.500,01:30:49.291,"So, I want you to pass the ball."
01:31:23.791,01:31:25.666,at an international conference.
01:31:27.208,01:31:28.458,You were made bishop.
01:31:30.166,01:31:31.666,But you did not live like one.
01:31:33.083,01:31:34.541,You renounced luxury.
01:31:35.833,01:31:39.208,You did the work once denied by Fathers Yorio and Jalics.
01:31:44.000,01:31:46.083,from which I had banished them.
01:31:47.541,01:31:57.083,"Every vegetable I chopped, every eviction we stopped, every case we won, I saw as some kind of penance."
01:32:07.541,01:32:08.958,We all suffer from...
01:32:09.916,01:32:11.166,spiritual pride.
01:32:11.250,01:32:12.250,We all do.
01:32:12.958,01:32:14.500,"You must remember that, uh..."
01:32:16.083,01:32:17.125,you are not God.
01:32:18.291,01:32:20.666,"In God, we move, and live, and have our being."
01:32:21.083,01:32:23.083,"We live in God, but we are not of it."
01:32:23.416,01:32:24.708,You're only human.
01:32:36.791,01:32:39.333,Human. Yeah.
01:32:43.208,01:32:46.291,"...if you'll allow me, my son."
01:32:47.750,01:32:48.583,You must...
01:32:49.333,01:32:51.833,believe in the mercy that you preach.
01:32:55.166,01:32:57.875,"in the name of the Father, the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
01:33:05.375,01:33:06.375,It's nine o'clock.
01:33:09.458,01:33:10.333,Grazie. Danke.
01:33:18.416,01:33:20.291,"Yeah. Come with me, I want to show you something."
01:33:29.750,01:33:40.750,"You know, I came in through that door as Joseph Ratzinger, and I went out through the same door Oh!"
01:33:41.708,01:33:42.625,Grazie.
01:33:42.916,01:33:43.916,Thank you.
01:33:45.083,01:33:47.250,"Holy Father, are-- are you hungry?"
01:33:47.875,01:33:49.208,"-Hungry? -Ah, sí."
01:33:49.500,01:33:51.666,"Yes, perhaps, you know, I think I am hungry."
01:33:51.750,01:33:55.250,"-Do you want me to ask the kitchen to... -No, no, no, there's no need. There's a..."
01:33:55.333,01:33:59.166,There is a place just in front of the Porta Angelica.
01:33:59.416,01:34:02.416,"Oh, you know it? Excellent pizza and coffee."
01:34:03.791,01:34:05.416,"-No, no, no, no. -Oh, no? Okay."
01:34:05.500,01:34:06.333,"Pizza, okay."
01:34:13.750,01:34:15.000,-Excuse me. -Whoa!
01:34:16.541,01:34:17.833,Excuse me.
01:34:17.916,01:34:28.666,"You know, always, in the past, whenever a pope, or Holy Father, would eat, at every meal, always at his side, would be three Jesuit brothers, and..."
01:34:31.958,01:34:36.000,I think the lack of Jesuits has probably poisoned more than one Holy Father.
01:34:39.583,01:34:43.000,-Just to be on the safe side. -No. No. That's mine. That's my pizza.
01:34:47.791,01:34:48.625,Yes.
01:34:53.833,01:34:58.666,"Thank you, Lord, for this food that we enjoy here, in this place outside of time."
01:34:59.750,01:35:04.833,"See, Lord, your Church, your flock is under attack, is in crisis."
01:35:05.416,01:35:10.125,"God, grant us the wisdom and the strength to oppose the hypocrisy that disfigures her."
01:35:11.375,01:35:16.250,"St. Francis, intercede for us as we seek to repair the Church."
01:35:17.958,01:35:19.583,Would you like to add something?
01:35:20.166,01:35:21.000,Amen.
01:35:21.333,01:35:23.000,Amen. It's good.
01:35:23.083,01:35:23.916,Yeah.
01:35:26.958,01:35:27.833,Mm.
01:35:36.583,01:35:40.583,"thinking about your teachers, Yorio and Jalics."
01:35:44.458,01:35:46.000,We said a Mass together.
01:35:54.708,01:35:55.541,Jalics.
01:35:57.333,01:35:59.791,Can you pass the stole? We're late.
01:36:06.083,01:36:07.666,and the Holy Spirit.
01:36:10.791,01:36:12.000,"Lord, wash me clean..."
01:36:53.625,01:36:54.916,in each other's arms.
01:37:22.791,01:37:23.833,He forgave me.
01:37:29.750,01:37:30.583,No.
01:37:32.208,01:37:34.833,"To the end, he saw me as a traitor."
01:37:40.708,01:37:44.791,I'm still seen as a divisive figure in Argentina.
01:37:46.291,01:37:47.125,Huh.
01:37:53.625,01:37:55.375,"You know, yesterday you said, uh..."
01:37:55.958,01:37:57.291,Life is never static.
01:37:57.916,01:37:58.750,Yeah?
01:37:59.708,01:38:00.541,Well...
01:38:02.750,01:38:03.750,You know...
01:38:05.458,01:38:10.708,"you lead... not by power and not by intellect, but you lead by..."
01:38:10.791,01:38:12.625,"you particularly, you lead by, um..."
01:38:13.083,01:38:15.208,the way you live or the way you have lived.
01:38:22.833,01:38:23.958,That man is...
01:38:25.416,01:38:26.500,is still inside me.
01:38:26.583,01:38:27.666,"That doubt, it..."
01:38:28.500,01:38:29.666,it still exists.
01:38:31.166,01:38:32.708,-Hmm? -Um...
01:38:33.000,01:38:36.625,"You think your sins disqualify you, but we are all sinners."
01:38:37.375,01:38:39.750,"Now, please, hear my confession."
01:38:41.833,01:38:44.208,"Well, would you deny me a confession, Bergoglio?"
01:38:44.291,01:38:46.708,"No, no, don't kneel. Don't kneel. Please, Holy Father."
01:38:48.708,01:38:53.250,"I think if I sit, it'll have to be an informal confession."
01:38:54.833,01:38:55.833,What should I say?
01:38:56.541,01:38:58.458,I don't know. What do you usually say?
01:39:01.750,01:39:03.666,How long since your last confession?
01:39:04.375,01:39:06.541,Eight... seven... eight days.
01:39:07.083,01:39:09.000,And have you sinned greatly in that...
01:39:09.083,01:39:11.250,"I'm sorry, I-- I don't mean to imply that you..."
01:39:14.125,01:39:18.166,"Several numerous venial sins, and, uh..."
01:39:19.125,01:39:22.875,"But I'm getting too old and, uh, forgetful to remember what they are."
01:39:25.083,01:39:28.125,I didn't know you could say that. That's... That's useful.
01:39:30.750,01:39:34.458,"I've sinned against you, Lord, whom I should love above all things."
01:39:37.291,01:39:39.541,"As a child, I failed you first by not..."
01:39:40.375,01:39:43.083,having the courage to taste of life itself.
01:39:44.958,01:39:47.250,"Instead, I hid away in books, and then study."
01:39:51.833,01:39:53.000,I know now that this...
01:39:54.083,01:39:56.250,left me empty and void of the world...
01:40:04.583,01:40:05.500,Go on.
01:40:16.666,01:40:18.625,Remember Father Maciel?
01:40:19.791,01:40:59.041,"There were claims 12 years ago that his molesting of boys Yes, I did not give sufficient attention to the duties assigned to this one priest."
01:40:59.125,01:41:00.583,Sufficient attention?
01:41:02.583,01:41:03.875,Village after village?
01:41:04.375,01:41:05.208,Yeah.
01:41:09.166,01:41:10.166,I should've known.
01:41:12.958,01:41:16.208,"Evidence was placed on my desk, but..."
01:41:16.291,01:41:19.000,You forgot to love the people you are meant to protect.
01:41:25.333,01:41:31.833,"if this is the sole reason you wish to resign, it is even more important that you stay, heal the wound."
01:41:31.916,01:41:34.250,-Listen to me. -Complete the work you have begun.
01:41:34.333,01:41:36.958,"You see, every reason I give you is not enough."
01:41:37.041,01:41:42.541,"So, let me tell you again, I can no longer sit on the Chair of Saint Peter."
01:41:42.625,01:41:45.500,-You're mistaken. -I cannot feel the presence of God.
01:41:45.583,01:41:48.375,"I do not hear His voice, do you understand me?"
01:41:48.458,01:41:50.666,"No. No, you're mistaken. You are mistaken."
01:41:50.750,01:41:52.791,I believe in God. I pray to God!
01:41:53.916,01:41:54.916,Silence!
01:42:06.125,01:42:08.333,I cannot play this role anymore.
01:42:10.208,01:42:11.208,I'm so sorry.
01:42:21.000,01:42:25.625,"Since I was a child, as a boy, I always felt His presence with me, at my side."
01:42:26.083,01:42:31.416,"For my entire life, I have been alone, but never lonely, until now."
01:42:35.291,01:42:36.125,Yeah.
01:42:39.875,01:42:42.708,But now I can hear His voice these last two days.
01:42:42.791,01:42:44.208,I've heard His voice again.
01:42:44.291,01:42:45.291,-I'm glad. -Yes.
01:42:47.875,01:42:52.208,And the voice is the last one I expected to hear Him speak with.
01:42:52.625,01:42:53.708,It was your voice.
01:42:58.666,01:43:09.416,"I think, perhaps, I could not hear Him not because He was withdrawing from me, but because He was saying, Go, my faithful servant."
01:43:20.416,01:43:24.375,has sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.
01:43:25.375,01:43:27.958,May God grant you His pardon and peace.
01:43:32.458,01:43:33.458,And remind you...
01:43:34.666,01:43:40.666,"that truth may be vital, but without love, it is unbearable."
01:43:43.291,01:43:45.458,Caritas in veritate. Your book.
01:43:48.458,01:43:51.958,"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."
01:43:52.291,01:43:53.125,Amen.
01:43:53.541,01:43:54.375,Amen.
01:43:59.166,01:44:02.041,You have lifted a great burden from my shoulders.
01:44:03.541,01:44:05.791,-You have placed a heavy one on mine. -Ah.
01:44:16.625,01:44:19.958,"Is there another way out, or shall I call security?"
01:44:22.916,01:44:24.125,"No, they're my people."
01:44:25.500,01:44:27.541,"At least, for now. Come on, let's go."
01:44:46.666,01:44:48.416,Buongiorno. Buongiorno.
01:44:56.166,01:44:58.208,"-Look, he's happy. -Hmm?"
01:45:04.458,01:45:05.458,Hey.
01:45:27.958,01:45:30.166,-You must be pleased to go home. -Ah...
01:45:34.083,01:45:37.625,"Terrible language, so many exceptions to so many rules."
01:45:37.708,01:45:38.625,Sí.
01:45:39.916,01:45:40.750,Remember...
01:45:53.166,01:45:54.333,When he was asked to...
01:45:55.041,01:45:58.708,"told by God to restore His Church, he thought He meant bricks and mortar."
01:46:01.208,01:46:03.333,Even he made mistakes and got things wrong.
01:46:05.333,01:46:06.166,Well.
01:46:06.333,01:46:07.916,-Ah. -Holy Father. Bye.
01:46:08.000,01:46:09.000,"-Bye. -No, please."
01:46:11.541,01:46:12.375,What?
01:46:12.458,01:46:15.208,"-You know, St. Francis, he loved to dance. -Oh, yes?"
01:46:15.291,01:46:17.208,He would have learned to tango. Hm?
01:46:17.291,01:46:19.625,"-Well, it's too late for me. -No, no, no, no."
01:46:19.708,01:46:21.125,Come. Come. I'll show you.
01:46:21.208,01:46:22.166,-Come. Come. Come. -No.
01:46:22.250,01:46:24.500,"-No, try. Come, I'll teach you. Come. -No."
01:46:24.583,01:46:25.875,"-I can't dance. -No, so..."
01:46:25.958,01:46:28.708,"Now, you see, I go forward with my right."
01:46:28.791,01:46:30.166,-Yeah. -And you go forward...
01:46:39.708,01:46:43.250,"...three, four. Half-step. And to the side, to the side."
01:46:48.666,01:46:49.958,"No, no, go away."
01:46:50.041,01:46:52.500,Leave me alone! Leave me alone! Go away! Go!
01:46:52.583,01:46:56.541,Auf Wiedersehen. Go. Go. To the airport. Go. Ooh!
01:46:57.875,01:46:58.750,Here.
01:47:03.041,01:47:04.791,-The Beatles. -Absolutely.
01:47:04.875,01:47:06.958,"-Go now. -Abbey Road, eh? Beautiful."
01:47:22.416,01:47:23.416,To the airport!
01:47:23.625,01:47:24.708,Don't bring him back.
01:47:29.166,01:47:30.000,Ciao.
01:48:54.583,01:48:55.416,Sí.
01:49:07.916,01:49:09.250,of Benedict XVI's papacy.
01:49:16.083,01:49:19.416,Simply a pilgrim who will still like to work for the common good.
01:49:26.833,01:49:31.875,"to see the election of a new pope, and for the first time, they may see that from Latin or North America."
01:49:34.333,01:49:38.708,between what happens within those walls and what goes on out there in the Church in the world.
01:49:41.875,01:49:43.208,or a more progressive one?
01:49:43.291,01:49:46.333,...standing at a crossroads between the old and the new...
01:49:47.041,01:50:23.000,"The cardinals are getting ready, in a ritual hours away from the first vote for the new pope, and they are-- Bergoglio."
01:50:23.583,01:50:25.708,Bergoglio Cardinalis.
01:50:31.625,01:50:33.458,Scola Cardinalis.
01:50:35.625,01:50:38.416,Bergoglio Cardinalis. Bergoglio Cardinalis.
01:50:38.916,01:50:41.666,Scola Cardinalis. Bergoglio Cardinalis.
01:50:41.750,01:50:44.625,Bergoglio Cardinalis. Bergoglio Cardinalis.
01:50:52.666,01:50:55.875,Bergoglio Cardinalis. Bergoglio Cardinalis.
01:51:21.958,01:51:23.041,Hmm?
01:52:04.041,01:52:05.333,and sisters...
01:52:09.708,01:52:11.125,"Ah, bene, grazie."
01:52:17.875,01:52:18.916,Grazie.
01:52:24.333,01:52:25.250,Hmm?
01:52:37.625,01:52:38.833,Habemus Papam.
01:52:45.666,01:52:46.541,Bene.
01:53:08.708,01:53:09.833,Grazie.
01:53:29.083,01:53:32.333,Cardinale... Bergoglio!
01:55:23.583,01:55:26.708,Let's pray together for him.
01:55:59.375,01:56:00.375,Like the pope?
01:56:04.500,01:56:05.375,Postcode?
01:56:08.708,01:56:10.666,"Yes, very funny."
01:56:17.958,01:56:18.791,Oh...
01:56:22.875,01:56:24.208,"Yes, Holy Father."
01:56:25.041,01:56:26.291,Really? Ah...
01:56:26.833,01:56:31.250,"Um, I am trying to get the Wi-Fi in here. You know how it works?"
01:56:31.333,01:56:32.333,The Wi-Fi?
01:56:32.458,01:56:37.625,"Sí, sí. I'm trying to make a booking, and apparently, the only way it can be done is online."
01:56:38.125,01:56:39.458,Can you help me at all?
01:56:39.958,01:56:41.250,"Of course, Holy Father."
01:56:41.708,01:56:42.583,Let me just...
01:56:42.666,01:56:43.958,I'll be very grateful.
01:56:52.083,01:56:53.375,And where to?
01:57:02.333,01:57:03.166,Oh...
01:57:04.208,01:57:06.375,"Would they let you go alone, Holy Father?"
01:57:06.458,01:57:07.333,Of course.
01:57:08.000,01:57:08.958,I'm the pope.
01:57:34.500,01:57:40.916,"There is a culture of conflict, which makes us think only of ourselves."
01:57:41.458,01:57:44.000,Makes us live in soap bubbles...
01:57:45.708,01:57:49.625,"...which, however lovely, are also insubstantial."
01:57:50.708,01:57:53.583,We've become used to the suffering of others.
01:57:53.833,01:57:55.666,It doesn't affect me.
01:57:56.708,01:58:00.416,No one in our world feels responsible.
01:58:03.333,01:58:07.875,Who is responsible for the blood of our brothers and sisters?
01:58:08.583,01:58:12.708,The refugees washed up on the shores of the Mediterranean?
01:58:13.833,01:58:15.833,I don't have anything to do with it.
01:58:15.916,01:58:17.166,Must be someone else.
01:58:25.291,01:58:26.875,When no one is to blame...
01:58:29.333,01:58:31.291,everyone is to blame.
01:59:18.500,01:59:20.958,"And, uh, ready to destroy you."
01:59:25.375,01:59:27.750,It's Germany versus Argentina.
01:59:27.833,01:59:29.583,Two great rivals.
01:59:29.666,01:59:32.625,"Here, they meet again for the end game."
01:59:36.708,01:59:37.583,You're famous.
01:59:40.750,01:59:41.583,in the semi-final.
01:59:45.041,01:59:46.541,I can feel the excitement.
01:59:50.750,01:59:52.375,"-Pizza. -Please, please, please."
01:59:54.791,01:59:57.291,and they have hosted a truly wonderful World Cup.
02:00:09.708,02:00:10.625,That's an obvious foul.
02:00:10.708,02:00:12.541,Müller has been sent crashing to the floor...
02:00:12.625,02:00:14.583,Argentina is very violent.
02:00:14.666,02:00:16.166,"No, it's all part of the game."
02:00:19.375,02:00:21.416,And Höwedes has met it!
02:00:21.708,02:00:24.541,-Off the post and gathered by Romero! -Ooh!
02:00:28.375,02:00:29.625,-and Higuaín has scored! -Ah!
02:00:31.791,02:00:32.916,Higuaín was offside.
02:00:38.333,02:00:40.625,Mascherano. Zabaleta.
02:00:43.333,02:00:45.041,That's a foul. That's a clear foul.
02:01:00.250,02:01:01.666,That's a swing of the arm.
02:01:04.375,02:01:06.458,"-No, it's nothing. It's a scratch. -Violent people."
02:01:06.541,02:01:08.416,-It's a scratch. -No.
02:01:11.041,02:01:12.291,to still be on the field.
02:01:16.000,02:01:16.958,André Schürrle.
02:01:17.875,02:01:19.333,Trying to make good progress.
02:01:19.416,02:01:21.750,And he fires the ball in to Götze!
02:01:28.125,02:01:30.500,What a moment in the Maracanã!
02:01:32.291,02:01:34.583,Now Germany can celebrate.
02:01:35.750,02:01:39.333,Germany are champions of the world!
02:01:40.500,02:01:41.416,Bravo!
02:01:54.958,02:01:59.875,by one glorious goal scored by Mario Götze.
02:01:59.958,02:02:01.583,It's Germany!
