00:02:43.538,00:02:46.750,It's the first time the Carnegie prize has been split. Hansen's all bent.

00:03:09.106,00:03:12.818,There could be a mathematical explanation for how bad your tie is.
00:03:18.573,00:03:20.408,Thank you.

00:03:30.209,00:03:32.253,The name's Bender.
00:03:32.295,00:03:34.548,- And you are?
00:03:34.589,00:03:35.590,- Yes.

00:03:46.727,00:03:49.021,"- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen."
00:03:49.063,00:03:53.984,- I'll take another.
00:03:54.026,00:03:56.111,A thousand pardons.
00:03:56.153,00:03:58.697,"- Play nice, Hansen."
00:03:58.739,00:04:02.534,"- Well, Martin Hansen."
00:04:02.576,00:04:07.039,"- It is Martin, isn't it?"
00:04:07.081,00:04:10.084,I imagine you're getting quite used to miscalculation.
00:04:12.127,00:04:18.133,I've read your pre-prints.
00:04:18.175,00:04:28.143,"The one on Nazi ciphers, and the other one on non-linear equations, and I am supremely confident that there is not a single seminal or innovative idea in either one of them."
00:04:31.688,00:04:33.565,Enjoy your punch.

00:05:21.780,00:05:26.326,The prodigal roommate arrives.
00:05:26.367,00:05:29.746,- Roommate?
00:05:29.788,00:05:32.373,- Ugh.
00:05:32.415,00:05:35.919,Did you know that having a hangover is...
00:05:35.961,00:05:40.715,Is not having enough water in your body to run your Krebs cycles?
00:05:40.757,00:05:43.802,Which is exactly what happens to you when you're dying of thirst.
00:05:43.844,00:05:48.056,"So, dying of thirst..."
00:05:48.098,00:05:55.814,...would probably feel pretty much like the hangover that finally bloody kills you.
00:05:58.859,00:06:02.654,- Hello.
00:06:02.696,00:06:04.572,Pleased to meet you.
00:06:13.957,00:06:15.750,well done.
00:06:21.006,00:06:25.260,I'm almost human again.
00:06:25.302,00:06:28.805,"Officer, I saw the driver who hit me."
00:06:32.433,00:06:34.269,Whew.
00:06:34.311,00:06:36.563,"Well, I got in last night in time for..."
00:06:36.604,00:06:39.900,...English department cocktails.

00:06:44.863,00:06:49.951,...D.H. Lawrence.
00:06:49.993,00:06:54.122,- I'm here to work.
00:07:03.631,00:07:06.218,Is my roommate a dick?
00:07:08.387,00:07:10.055,Hmm?
00:07:10.097,00:07:12.182,Listen.
00:07:12.224,00:07:13.516,If we can't break the ice...
00:07:14.809,00:07:16.561,...how about we drown it?
00:07:26.947,00:07:29.657,"So, what's your story?"
00:07:29.699,00:07:34.495,You the poor kid that never got to go to Exeter or Andover?
00:07:34.537,00:07:36.790,"Despite my privileged upbringing, I'm actually quite well-balanced."
00:07:36.831,00:07:38.541,I have a chip on both shoulders.
00:07:38.583,00:07:44.631,Maybe you're just better with the old integers than you are with people.
00:07:44.672,00:07:49.761,"My first grade teacher, she told me that I was born with two helpings of brain, but only half a helping of heart."
00:07:51.471,00:07:54.015,Wow! She sounds lovely!
00:07:54.057,00:07:56.935,The truth is that I...
00:07:56.977,00:07:58.979,I don't like people much.
00:07:59.020,00:08:01.315,And they don't much like me.
00:08:01.356,00:08:04.484,"But why, with all your obvious wit and charm?"
00:08:06.945,00:08:08.529,"Seriously, John."
00:08:10.157,00:08:13.201,Mathematics...
00:08:13.243,00:08:16.079,Mathematics is never going to lead you to a higher truth.
00:08:16.121,00:08:19.958,And you know why?
00:08:20.000,00:08:21.460,It's really boring.
00:08:21.501,00:08:24.545,You know half these schoolboys are already published?
00:08:26.506,00:08:28.383,I cannot waste time with these classes...
00:08:28.425,00:08:30.551,...and these books.
00:08:33.847,00:08:35.765,Memorizing the weaker assumptions of lesser mortals!
00:08:38.643,00:08:43.315,I need to look through to the governing dynamics.
00:08:47.861,00:08:52.032,Find a truly original idea.
00:08:52.073,00:08:52.824,It's the only way that I'll ever...
00:08:52.866,00:08:53.908,Matter.
00:08:57.578,00:08:59.247,Yes.
00:09:00.957,00:09:02.459,"All right, who's next?"
00:09:02.501,00:09:04.044,"No, I've played enough go for one day."
00:09:04.085,00:09:05.962,- Come on.
00:09:06.004,00:09:07.964,"Cowards, all of you!"
00:09:08.006,00:09:10.384,None of you rise to meet my challenge?
00:09:10.425,00:09:11.843,"Come on, Bender."
00:09:10.425,00:09:14.262,"Whoever wins, Sol does his laundry all semester."
00:09:14.304,00:09:18.517,- Does that seem unfair to anyone else?
00:09:18.558,00:09:21.353,- Nash!
00:09:21.395,00:09:22.812,Taking a reverse constitutional?
00:09:22.854,00:09:26.607,I'm hoping to extract an algorithm to define their movement.
00:09:28.776,00:09:32.280,- Oh.
00:09:32.322,00:09:34.866,I thought you dropped out.
00:09:34.908,00:09:36.784,You ever going to go to class or...
00:09:36.826,00:09:40.247,Classes will dull your mind.
00:09:40.288,00:09:42.707,Destroy the potential for authentic creativity.
00:09:42.749,00:09:44.667,"Oh, oh, I didn't know that."
00:09:44.709,00:09:46.503,Nash is going to stun us all with his genius.
00:09:46.545,00:09:50.006,Which is another way of saying he doesn't have the nerve to compete.
00:09:52.342,00:09:55.303,- You scared?
00:09:55.345,00:09:58.765,Mortified. Petrified.
00:09:58.806,00:10:01.101,No starch.
00:10:01.142,00:10:02.894,Pressed and folded.
00:10:06.189,00:10:07.941,"Let me ask you something, John."
00:10:07.982,00:10:10.068,"Be my guest, Martin."
00:10:10.110,00:10:14.155,Bender and Sol here correctly completed Allen's proof of Peyrot's Conjecture.
00:10:14.197,00:10:17.742,Adequate work...
00:10:17.784,00:10:20.870,- Oh. I'm flattered.
00:10:20.912,00:10:25.833,And I've got two weapons briefs under security review by the D.O.D.
00:10:25.875,00:10:30.338,- Derivative drivel.
00:10:25.875,00:10:33.258,- But Nash achievements: - Zero.
00:10:33.300,00:10:34.801,Is there an actual question coming?
00:10:34.842,00:10:39.514,What if you never come up with your original idea?
00:10:39.556,00:10:41.724,Huh?
00:10:41.766,00:10:46.605,"How will it feel when I'm chosen for Wheeler, and you're not?"
00:10:50.024,00:10:51.901,What if you lose?
00:11:02.912,00:11:05.873,- You should not have won.
00:11:05.915,00:11:08.709,"I had the first move, my... my play was perfect."
00:11:08.751,00:11:09.961,The hubris of the defeated.
00:11:10.003,00:11:11.796,The game is flawed.
00:11:18.803,00:11:21.097,"Gentlemen, the great John Nash."
00:11:27.646,00:11:30.607,in here for two days.
00:11:33.360,00:11:35.778,You know Hansen's just published another paper?
00:11:35.820,00:11:39.907,I can't even find a topic for my doctorate.
00:11:39.949,00:11:43.286,"Well, on the bright side, you've invented window art."
00:11:45.664,00:11:47.915,This is a group playing touch football.
00:11:47.957,00:11:51.710,This is a cluster of pigeons fighting over bread crumbs.
00:11:54.381,00:11:57.008,And this here is a woman who is chasing a man who stole her purse.
00:11:58.717,00:12:02.347,"John, you watched a mugging."
00:12:02.389,00:12:05.099,In competitive behavior someone always loses.
00:12:05.141,00:12:09.187,"Well, my niece knows that, John, and she's about this high."
00:12:09.229,00:12:23.451,"See, if I could derive an equilibrium where prevalence is a non-singular event, where nobody loses, can you imagine the effect that would have - on conflict scenarios, and arms negotiations..."
00:12:23.493,00:12:26.204,- ...currency exchange?
00:12:28.747,00:12:31.459,"You have no respect for cognitive reverie, you know that?"
00:12:31.501,00:12:33.712,Yes. But pizza...
00:12:35.296,00:12:38.717,"Now, pizza I have enormous respect for."
00:12:39.926,00:12:41.636,And of course beer.
00:12:47.892,00:12:49.269,I have respect for beer.
00:12:51.104,00:12:53.064,I have respect for beer!
00:13:01.322,00:13:03.283,Neils.
00:13:03.324,00:13:05.784,Who's winning?
00:13:11.458,00:13:13.334,at you for sure.
00:13:18.089,00:13:19.633,"Hey, Nash."
00:13:19.674,00:13:21.676,Neils is trying to get your attention.
00:13:28.975,00:13:31.102,- Go with God.
00:13:32.771,00:13:35.607,- Fortune favors the brave.
00:13:37.776,00:13:43.615,"Gentlemen, might I remind you that my odds of success dramatically improve with each attempt?"
00:13:52.791,00:13:54.584,This is going to be classic.
00:14:25.948,00:14:27.742,Maybe you want to buy me a drink.
00:14:33.331,00:14:40.880,"I don't exactly know what I'm required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me, but could we assume that I said all that?"
00:14:40.921,00:14:43.132,"Essentially we're talking about fluid exchange, right?"
00:14:43.174,00:14:45.552,"So, could we just go straight to the sex?"
00:14:47.679,00:14:48.596,"Oh, that was sweet."
00:14:49.972,00:14:52.266,"Have a nice night, asshole!"
00:14:57.731,00:14:59.733,I especially liked the bit about fluid exchange.
00:14:59.774,00:15:02.736,It was really charming.
00:15:06.447,00:15:08.241,"Walk with me, John."
00:15:08.282,00:15:10.117,I've been meaning to talk with you.
00:15:10.159,00:15:15.331,The faculty is completing mid-year reviews.
00:15:15.373,00:15:18.251,We're deciding which placement applications to support.
00:15:18.292,00:15:20.002,"Wheeler, sir."
00:15:20.044,00:15:21.295,"And actually, I don't really have a second choice, sir."
00:15:21.337,00:15:24.758,"John, your fellows have attended classes."
00:15:24.799,00:15:26.926,They've written papers.
00:15:26.967,00:15:29.220,"I'm still searching, sir, for my..."
00:15:29.262,00:15:31.598,"- Your original idea, I know."
00:15:31.639,00:15:34.308,"It's very clever, John, but I'm afraid it's just not nearly good enough."
00:15:41.733,00:15:43.568,- May I?
00:15:43.610,00:15:46.738,I've been working on manifold embedding.
00:15:46.780,00:15:48.489,My bargaining stratagems are starting to show some promise.
00:15:48.531,00:15:52.660,"If you could just arrange another meeting, if you'd be kind enough, with Professor Einstein..."
00:15:52.702,00:15:54.245,- I've repeatedly asked you for that.
00:15:54.287,00:15:56.831,- I'd be able to show him my revisions on his...
00:16:00.042,00:16:01.586,Do you see what they're doing in there?
00:16:03.421,00:16:07.467,"Congratulations, Professor Max."
00:16:07.508,00:16:09.636,- Thank you.
00:16:11.011,00:16:12.430,It's the pens.
00:16:12.472,00:16:16.684,Reserved for a member of the department that makes the achievement of a lifetime.
00:16:16.726,00:16:19.479,"Now, what do you see, John?"
00:16:19.520,00:16:22.189,Recognition.
00:16:22.231,00:16:25.025,"Well done, Professor, well done."
00:16:25.067,00:16:27.528,"Well, try seeing accomplishment."
00:16:27.570,00:16:28.947,Is there a difference?
00:16:28.988,00:16:32.575,"John, you haven't focused."
00:16:34.869,00:16:39.916,"I'm sorry, but up to this point, your record doesn't warrant any placement at all."
00:16:43.544,00:16:45.004,Good day.
00:16:55.807,00:16:57.558,"And my compliments to you, sir."
00:16:57.600,00:16:59.769,Thank you so much.
00:17:16.619,00:17:18.287,I can't see it.
00:17:25.127,00:17:27.797,- Aah!
00:17:27.839,00:17:30.758,I can't fail.
00:17:30.800,00:17:33.594,- This is all I am.
00:17:33.636,00:17:35.513,- I got to get something done.
00:17:35.555,00:17:38.182,- I can't keep staring into space.
00:17:38.224,00:17:41.310,"Got to face the wall, follow their rules, read their books..."
00:17:41.352,00:17:42.729,You want to do some damage? Fine.
00:17:42.770,00:17:44.856,- But don't mess around.
00:17:44.898,00:17:47.734,Come on!
00:17:47.775,00:17:51.529,"John, do it."
00:17:51.571,00:17:55.199,Bust your head!
00:17:55.241,00:17:57.035,"Goddamn it, Charles!"
00:18:00.914,00:18:03.041,It's not my problem.
00:18:04.625,00:18:06.544,And it's not your problem.
00:18:09.463,00:18:11.883,It's their problem.
00:18:11.925,00:18:15.177,Your answer isn't face the wall.
00:18:15.219,00:18:18.848,"It's out there, where you've been working."
00:18:40.661,00:18:42.830,That was heavy.
00:18:45.458,00:18:48.544,That Isaac Newton fellow was right.
00:18:48.586,00:18:50.254,- He was onto something.
00:18:50.296,00:18:52.465,that's mine.
00:18:52.506,00:18:53.716,I'll come and get it in a minute.
00:18:53.758,00:18:56.260,"- Oh, God."
00:18:59.764,00:19:02.767,"Incoming, gentlemen."
00:19:10.149,00:19:13.945,want to stop shuffling your papers for five seconds.
00:19:18.825,00:19:20.827,I will not buy you gentlemen beer.
00:19:20.868,00:19:23.788,"for beer, my friend."
00:19:26.707,00:19:31.211,Does anyone else feel she should be moving in slow motion?
00:19:31.253,00:19:33.380,"Will she want a large wedding, ya think?"
00:19:33.422,00:19:34.715,"Shall we say swords, gentlemen?"
00:19:34.757,00:19:37.885,- Pistols at dawn?
00:19:37.927,00:19:42.306,"Recall the lessons of Adam Smith, the father of modern economics."
00:19:42.348,00:19:44.725,In competition...
00:19:44.767,00:19:46.853,Individual ambition serves the common good.
00:19:46.894,00:19:49.605,- Exactly.
00:19:49.647,00:19:51.649,out are stuck with her friends.
00:19:51.691,00:19:54.027,I'm not gonna strike out.
00:19:54.068,00:19:55.945,"a blonde to water, but you can't make her drink."
00:19:55.987,00:19:58.781,- I don't think he said that.
00:19:58.823,00:20:01.325,She's looking over here.
00:20:01.367,00:20:05.579,"have the upper hand now, but wait until he opens his mouth."
00:20:05.621,00:20:07.790,- Remember the last time?
00:20:07.832,00:20:09.625,for the history books.
00:20:16.674,00:20:18.217,Adam Smith needs revision.
00:20:18.258,00:20:20.219,What are you talking about?
00:20:20.260,00:20:22.930,If we all go for the blonde...
00:20:27.810,00:20:29.145,...we block each other.
00:20:29.187,00:20:33.774,Not a single one of us is gonna get her.
00:20:33.816,00:20:41.532,"So then we go for her friends, but they will all give us the cold shoulder because nobody likes to be second choice."
00:20:41.574,00:20:44.368,"Well, what if no one goes for the blonde?"
00:20:46.620,00:20:51.000,"We don't get in each other's way, and we don't insult the other girls."
00:20:52.668,00:20:54.378,That's the only way we win.
00:20:56.422,00:20:58.424,That's the only way we all get laid.
00:21:04.388,00:21:11.437,"Adam Smith said the best result comes from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself, right?"
00:21:11.478,00:21:12.646,"That's what he said, right?"
00:21:12.688,00:21:15.942,- Right.
00:21:15.983,00:21:17.944,Because the best result will come...
00:21:20.154,00:21:27.036,...from everyone in the group doing what's best for himself - and the group.
00:21:23.616,00:21:30.664,"- Nash, if this is some way for you to get the blonde on your own, - you can go to hell."
00:21:30.706,00:21:32.792,Governing dynamics.
00:21:32.833,00:21:34.919,...was wrong.
00:21:40.800,00:21:42.384,Thank you.
00:21:54.730,00:21:57.817,C over S equals C over T.
00:22:59.753,00:23:04.591,You do realize this flies in the face - of a 150 years of economic theory?
00:23:04.633,00:23:06.802,"That's rather presumptuous, don't you think?"
00:23:06.844,00:23:08.346,"It is, sir."
00:23:15.353,00:23:23.777,"Well, Mr. Nash, with a breakthrough of this magnitude, I'm confident you will get any placement you like."
00:23:29.992,00:23:35.873,"Wheeler Labs, they'll ask you to recommend two team members."
00:23:39.210,00:23:41.879,Stills and Frank are excellent choices.
00:23:41.921,00:23:43.881,"Sol and Bender, sir."
00:23:43.923,00:23:47.218,Sol and Bender are extraordinary mathematicians.
00:23:47.260,00:23:50.930,Has it occurred to you that Sol and Bender might have plans of their own?
00:23:56.476,00:23:58.562,- Baby!
00:23:58.604,00:24:03.984,"- Cheers, cheers, cheers!"
00:24:04.026,00:24:06.653,"OK, awkward moment, gentlemen."
00:24:27.216,00:24:30.344,Umm... hmm.
00:24:31.804,00:24:32.930,Governing dynamics.
00:24:36.600,00:24:37.643,"- Congratulations, John."
00:24:37.684,00:24:39.728,- Toast!
00:25:05.671,00:25:09.342,from Wheeler Lab is here.
00:25:09.383,00:25:10.634,"Dr. Nash, your coat?"
00:25:10.676,00:25:12.678,"Thank you, sir."
00:25:12.719,00:25:16.556,"Doctor. General, this is Wheeler team leader Dr. John Nash."
00:25:16.598,00:25:19.810,"- Glad you could come, doctor."
00:25:19.852,00:25:22.146,Right this way.
00:25:22.188,00:25:25.858,We've been intercepting radio transmissions from Moscow.
00:25:25.899,00:25:29.695,"The computer can't detect a pattern, but I'm sure it's code."
00:25:32.530,00:25:34.992,"Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?"
00:25:37.577,00:25:39.537,Constantly.
00:25:41.457,00:25:43.750,several ciphers.
00:25:45.794,00:25:47.587,If you'd like to review our preliminary data...
00:25:50.174,00:25:51.758,Doctor?
00:26:08.608,00:26:09.943,8-4-9-4.
00:26:39.723,00:26:42.893,9-1-4-0-3-4.
00:26:59.617,00:27:01.495,I need a map.
00:27:03.830,00:27:08.294,"46-13-08, 67-46-90."
00:27:10.628,00:27:12.089,"Starkey Corners, Maine."
00:27:13.840,00:27:18.011,"48-03-01, 91-26-35."
00:27:19.305,00:27:21.014,"Prairie Portage, Minnesota."
00:27:21.056,00:27:24.101,These are latitudes and longitudes.
00:27:24.143,00:27:26.103,There are a least ten others.
00:27:26.145,00:27:28.522,They appear to be routing orders across the border into the U.S.
00:27:30.190,00:27:32.443,Extraordinary.
00:27:32.485,00:27:36.280,"Gentlemen, we need to move on this."
00:27:37.573,00:27:39.908,Who's big brother?
00:27:39.950,00:27:42.077,"You've done your country a great service, son."
00:27:42.119,00:27:44.288,- Captain!
00:27:45.998,00:27:48.208,Accompany Dr. Nash.
00:27:48.250,00:27:51.753,"What are the Russians moving, General?"
00:27:51.795,00:27:56.800,"Captain Rogers will escort you to the unrestricted area, doctor. Thank you."
00:27:56.842,00:27:59.011,"Dr. Nash, follow me, please."
00:28:06.143,00:28:14.234,None of those who have said they don't like the method have told us any other method they could use that would be effective.
00:28:14.276,00:28:15.569,- And when you hear...
00:28:15.611,00:28:17.070,All right.
00:28:30.834,00:28:33.837,"- Thank you, sir."
00:28:33.879,00:28:36.340,Have they actually taken the word classified out of the dictionary?
00:28:36.382,00:28:39.759,"Oh, hi. The air conditioning broke again."
00:28:39.801,00:28:44.473,How am I supposed to be in here saving the world - if I'm melting?
00:28:44.515,00:28:47.893,"You know, two trips to the Pentagon in four years."
00:28:47.934,00:28:50.479,- Two more than we've had.
00:28:50.521,00:28:53.691,Just got our latest scintillating assignment.
00:28:53.732,00:29:04.910,"You know, the Russians have the H-bomb, the Nazis are repatriating South America, the Chinese have a standing army of 2.8 million, and I am doing stress tests on a dam."
00:29:04.951,00:29:07.580,You made the cover of Fortune... again.
00:29:07.621,00:29:09.540,"Please note the use of the word you, not we."
00:29:10.999,00:29:12.751,That was supposed to be just me.
00:29:16.547,00:29:23.470,"So not only do they rob me of the Fields medal, now they put me on the cover of Fortune magazine with these hacks, these scholars of trivia."
00:29:23.512,00:29:26.640,"John, exactly what's the difference between genius and most genius?"
00:29:28.308,00:29:29.518,Quite a lot.
00:29:29.560,00:29:30.977,He's your son.
00:29:31.019,00:29:33.772,"Anyway, you've got ten minutes."
00:29:33.813,00:29:36.734,- I've always got ten minutes.
00:29:42.698,00:29:44.824,Can I not get a note from a doctor or something?
00:29:44.866,00:29:48.828,"You are a doctor, John, and no."
00:29:48.870,00:29:52.458,"Now, come on, you know the drill, we get these beautiful facilities..."
00:29:52.499,00:29:56.503,M.I.T. gets America's great minds of today teaching America's great minds of tomorrow.
00:29:56.545,00:29:59.590,- Poor bastards.
00:29:59.632,00:30:00.758,The bell's ringing.
00:30:23.155,00:30:25.574,The eager young minds of tomorrow.
00:30:35.417,00:30:36.835,"Can we leave one open, professor?"
00:30:36.876,00:30:38.629,"It's really hot, sir."
00:30:40.130,00:30:43.801,Your comfort comes second to my ability to hear my own voice.
00:30:50.265,00:30:57.939,"Personally, I think this class will be a waste of your, and what is infinitely worse..."
00:30:59.191,00:31:00.900,...my time.
00:31:02.152,00:31:05.656,"However, here we are."
00:31:05.698,00:31:08.575,So you may attend or not.
00:31:08.617,00:31:11.745,You may complete your assignments at your whim.
00:31:11.787,00:31:13.580,We have begun.
00:31:15.666,00:31:17.334,Miss.
00:31:21.087,00:31:22.339,Excuse me!
00:31:23.632,00:31:25.467,- Excuse me!
00:31:25.509,00:31:27.678,Hi!
00:31:27.720,00:31:30.889,"Um, we have a little problem."
00:31:30.930,00:31:36.395,It's extremely hot in here with the windows closed and extremely noisy with them open.
00:31:36.436,00:31:42.818,"So, I was wondering if there was any way you could, I don't know, maybe work someplace else - for about 45 minutes?"
00:31:42.860,00:31:44.903,Thank you so much!
00:31:44.944,00:31:47.823,- At a break!
00:31:47.865,00:31:51.744,Let's clean it a little bit!
00:31:51.785,00:31:58.751,"As you will find in multivariable calculus, there is often a number of solutions for any given problem."
00:32:02.962,00:32:08.761,"As I was saying, this problem here will take some of you many months to solve."
00:32:08.802,00:32:14.808,"For others among you, it will take you the term of your natural lives."
00:32:44.588,00:32:46.465,William Parcher.
00:32:46.506,00:32:51.804,"Big brother, at your service."
00:32:51.845,00:32:54.264,What can I do for the Department of Defense?
00:32:54.306,00:32:56.099,Are you going to give me a raise?
00:32:56.141,00:32:59.018,Let's take a walk.
00:32:59.060,00:33:02.689,- Impressive work at the Pentagon.
00:33:02.731,00:33:06.985,"Oppenheimer used to say, Genius sees the answer before the question."
00:33:07.026,00:33:10.530,- You knew Oppenheimer?
00:33:10.572,00:33:12.324,Which project?
00:33:15.535,00:33:16.954,That project.
00:33:16.995,00:33:18.622,"It's not that simple, you know?"
00:33:18.664,00:33:20.540,"Well, you ended the war."
00:33:20.582,00:33:24.043,"We incinerated 150,000 people in a heartbeat."
00:33:24.085,00:33:27.088,"Great deeds come at great cost, Mr. Parcher."
00:33:27.130,00:33:33.595,"Well, conviction, it turns out, is a luxury of those on the sidelines, Mr. Nash."
00:33:34.888,00:33:37.140,I'll try and keep that in mind.
00:33:40.477,00:33:46.859,"So, John, no family, no close friends."
00:33:46.900,00:33:49.277,because I'm a lone wolf.
00:33:50.988,00:33:52.739,But mainly it's because people don't like me.
00:33:52.781,00:34:00.706,are certain endeavors where your lack of personal connection would be considered an advantage.
00:34:02.749,00:34:04.751,- This is a secure area.
00:34:08.797,00:34:10.507,Have you ever been here?
00:34:10.549,00:34:13.760,We were told during our initial briefing that these warehouses were abandoned.
00:34:13.802,00:34:15.846,That's not precisely accurate.
00:34:53.383,00:34:58.764,"By telling you what I'm about to tell you, I am increasing your security clearance to top secret."
00:34:58.805,00:35:02.684,Disclosure of secure information can result in imprisonment.
00:35:02.726,00:35:05.771,- Get it?
00:35:11.610,00:35:13.319,Those are a good idea.
00:35:17.365,00:35:21.244,This factory is in Berlin.
00:35:21.286,00:35:26.124,Nazi engineers were attempting to build a portable atomic bomb.
00:35:26.165,00:35:29.044,"The Soviets reached this facility before we did, and we lost the damn thing."
00:35:31.463,00:35:36.593,"The routing orders at the Pentagon, they were about this, weren't they?"
00:35:38.344,00:35:40.931,The Soviets aren't as unified as people believe.
00:35:40.973,00:35:49.230,"A faction of the Red Army calling itself Novaya Svobga, the New Freedom, has control of the bomb and intends to detonate it on U.S. soil."
00:35:49.272,00:35:53.610,Their plan is to incur maximum civilian casualties.
00:35:58.657,00:36:01.284,of as much atrocity as he has imagination.
00:36:03.703,00:36:06.999,New Freedom has sleeper agents here in the U.S.
00:36:07.040,00:36:12.378,"McCarthy is an idiot, but unfortunately that doesn't make him wrong."
00:36:12.420,00:36:22.430,"New Freedom communicates to its agents through codes imbedded in newspapers and magazines, and that's where you come in."
00:36:19.260,00:36:32.231,"You see, John, what distinguishes you is that you are, quite simply, the best natural code-breaker I have ever seen."
00:36:38.279,00:36:40.657,What exactly is it that you would like me to do?
00:36:46.204,00:36:48.707,Commit this list of periodicals to memory.
00:36:50.458,00:36:55.630,"Scan each new issue, find any hidden codes, decipher them."
00:36:57.590,00:36:59.676,on the chin rest.
00:36:59.718,00:37:03.262,- Stare into the light.
00:37:07.642,00:37:09.019,"OK, this may be a little uncomfortable."
00:37:10.645,00:37:13.356,"That's got a little zap to it, doesn't it?"
00:37:13.398,00:37:16.902,He just implanted a radium diode.
00:37:16.943,00:37:21.990,"Don't worry, it's safe."
00:37:22.032,00:37:25.493,"As a result, these numbers change over time."
00:37:25.535,00:37:28.287,They're the access codes to your drop spot.
00:37:30.582,00:37:33.043,"So, what am I now, a spy?"
00:37:44.804,00:37:47.306,- Come.
00:37:51.978,00:37:54.231,"Boy, you must be really important."
00:38:02.614,00:38:03.823,"It's all right, Mike."
00:38:13.959,00:38:15.085,What are you working on?
00:38:17.837,00:38:19.089,Classified.
00:38:20.966,00:38:22.884,Everyone waited half an hour.
00:38:22.926,00:38:26.096,- For?
00:38:26.138,00:38:28.014,You missed class today.
00:38:28.056,00:38:30.934,Oh. I suspect that...
00:38:32.811,00:38:35.981,...nobody missed me.
00:38:36.022,00:38:37.649,The problem that you left on the board...
00:38:39.609,00:38:41.319,I solved it.
00:38:41.360,00:38:45.740,"- Oh, no you didn't."
00:38:45.782,00:38:48.952,I never said that the Vector Fields were rational functions.
00:38:53.248,00:38:55.500,Your solution is elegant.
00:38:58.086,00:39:03.549,"Though on this particular occasion, ultimately incorrect."
00:39:25.280,00:39:28.741,- You're still here.
00:39:28.783,00:39:32.954,- Why?
00:39:28.783,00:39:38.168,"- I'm wondering, Professor Nash, if I can ask you to dinner."
00:39:42.672,00:39:44.299,"You do eat, don't you?"
00:39:44.341,00:39:47.052,"Oh, on occasion, yeah."
00:39:47.093,00:39:52.224,"Table for one. Prometheus alone chained to the rock with the bird circling overhead, you know how it is."
00:39:55.810,00:39:57.687,"No, I expect that you wouldn't..."
00:40:01.524,00:40:09.782,"If you leave your address with my office, I'll pick you up Friday at 8:00 and we'll eat."
00:40:16.789,00:40:20.168,One more thing.
00:40:16.789,00:40:21.836,"Do you have a name, or should I just keep calling you miss?"
00:40:23.963,00:40:26.383,"Governor, may I present..."
00:40:26.424,00:40:29.261,- Miss Alicia Larde.
00:40:29.302,00:40:32.055,- How do you do?
00:40:35.600,00:40:40.313,"Wait, one second. I'm sorry."
00:40:40.355,00:40:41.773,"First big date and all, you know."
00:40:41.814,00:40:45.026,"So, you boys need to look good."
00:40:45.068,00:40:50.823,Which is not a state you find yourselves in altogether naturally.
00:40:54.286,00:40:57.622,There. Better.
00:40:57.663,00:41:01.209,- I'm surprising him.
00:41:01.251,00:41:03.378,Professor.
00:41:19.394,00:41:22.147,God must be a painter.
00:41:22.188,00:41:25.024,Why else would we have so many colors?
00:41:27.735,00:41:29.487,So you're a painter?
00:41:31.156,00:41:37.787,"That's not actually what I said, but, yes, I am."
00:41:46.796,00:41:49.090,Here.
00:41:49.132,00:41:51.301,Me.
00:41:51.343,00:41:52.593,Your date?
00:41:55.096,00:41:57.890,Practice human interaction and social comportment.
00:41:59.058,00:42:00.685,That's a plan.
00:42:02.770,00:42:04.814,Champagne would be lovely.
00:42:07.275,00:42:08.485,I'll be outside.
00:42:08.526,00:42:10.736,I will get the champagne.
00:42:19.245,00:42:21.247,"Oh, thank you."
00:42:22.707,00:42:26.836,- Thank you for that.
00:42:26.878,00:42:32.091,I believe in deciding things will be good luck. Do you?
00:42:32.133,00:42:36.054,No.
00:42:40.558,00:42:42.601,But I do believe in assigning value to things.
00:42:44.020,00:42:45.355,Oh.
00:42:53.530,00:42:55.532,I once tried to count them all.
00:42:56.866,00:43:01.746,"I actually made it to 4,348."
00:43:03.415,00:43:05.417,You are exceptionally odd.
00:43:05.458,00:43:08.336,I bet you're very popular with the girls.
00:43:14.592,00:43:16.635,"A pair of odd ducks, then."
00:43:17.887,00:43:19.055,Mmm.
00:43:22.308,00:43:23.684,Pick a shape.
00:43:25.228,00:43:27.272,What?
00:43:27.313,00:43:30.691,Pick a shape.
00:43:32.235,00:43:34.237,OK.
00:43:35.405,00:43:36.989,An umbrella.
00:44:15.027,00:44:16.070,Do it again.
00:44:17.447,00:44:19.907,- Do it again.
00:44:19.949,00:44:21.159,- What would you like?
00:44:21.200,00:44:22.785,...an octopus.
00:47:13.706,00:47:16.083,"You don't talk much, do you?"
00:47:16.125,00:47:17.960,"I can't talk to you about my work, Alicia."
00:47:19.086,00:47:20.879,I don't mean work.
00:47:26.010,00:47:32.642,I find that polishing my interactions in order to make them sociable requires a tremendous effort.
00:47:32.684,00:47:35.394,I have a tendency to expedite information flow...
00:47:38.272,00:47:39.691,...by being direct.
00:47:41.400,00:47:43.820,I often don't get a pleasant result.
00:47:43.860,00:47:45.237,Try me.
00:47:47.198,00:47:48.991,All right.
00:47:52.286,00:47:55.498,I find you attractive.
00:47:55.540,00:47:59.544,Your aggressive moves towards me indicate that you feel the same way.
00:47:59.585,00:48:07.926,"But still, ritual requires that we continue with a number of platonic activities before we have sex."
00:48:07.968,00:48:16.018,"I am proceeding with those activities, but in point of actual fact, all I really want to do is have intercourse with you as soon as possible."
00:48:19.146,00:48:20.815,Are you gonna slap me now?
00:48:46.340,00:48:47.717,How was that result?
00:49:11.365,00:49:16.579,I'm attempting to isolate patterned re-occurrences within periodicals over time. And you?
00:49:16.621,00:49:18.873,"You talk funny, Mr. Nash."
00:49:23.377,00:49:25.421,Do I know you?
00:49:25.463,00:49:31.427,"My uncle says you're very smart but not very nice, so I shouldn't pay no mind if you're mean to me."
00:49:31.469,00:49:33.721,And who might your uncle be?
00:49:33.763,00:49:34.847,The prodigal roommate...
00:49:36.348,00:49:37.934,...returns.
00:49:42.020,00:49:44.231,- Come here.
00:49:49.027,00:49:53.282,My sister got herself killed in a car crash.
00:49:55.159,00:49:56.661,"Not too far now, Marcee!"
00:49:56.702,00:50:02.249,Her cowboy husband was too drunk to know that he was too drunk to drive.
00:50:02.291,00:50:05.336,"So, I took her in."
00:50:05.377,00:50:09.548,- She's so small.
00:50:11.634,00:50:15.680,I'm at Harvard doing the great author's workshop.
00:50:15.721,00:50:18.641,D.H. Bloody Lawrence.
00:50:18.683,00:50:20.726,I really do think you should buy yourself a new book.
00:50:23.437,00:50:25.648,"Well, I've been reading a lot about you."
00:50:27.441,00:50:29.151,"How are you, John?"
00:50:29.193,00:50:34.657,"At first all my work here was trivial, but a new assignment came up and..."
00:50:36.408,00:50:37.952,I can't really tell you any details.
00:50:37.994,00:50:40.621,Top secret?
00:50:40.663,00:50:42.498,Something like that.
00:50:42.540,00:50:45.918,"- And, uh..."
00:50:47.336,00:50:48.713,"Well, I... I met a girl."
00:50:48.754,00:50:51.465,- No! A human girl?
00:50:51.507,00:50:54.218,- A biped?
00:50:51.507,00:50:55.678,"- Yup. And contrary to all probabilities, she finds me attractive on a number of different levels."
00:50:55.720,00:50:59.097,"God, that's wonderful."
00:50:59.139,00:51:02.351,"There's no accounting for taste, is there?"
00:51:05.521,00:51:07.272,Should I marry her?
00:51:07.314,00:51:09.692,"Oh, God. Right."
00:51:09.734,00:51:12.194,"I mean, everything's going well."
00:51:12.236,00:51:14.363,The job is fine.
00:51:14.405,00:51:18.951,It all seems to add up.
00:51:21.787,00:51:25.165,"Nothing's ever for sure, John."
00:51:25.207,00:51:26.918,That's the only sure thing I do know.
00:51:41.933,00:51:44.602,"Alicia, please don't be angry."
00:51:44.643,00:51:46.311,I just lost track of time at work...
00:51:47.354,00:51:49.273,- Again.
00:51:50.274,00:51:52.526,I'm sorry.
00:51:52.568,00:51:54.570,I didn't have time to wrap it.
00:51:56.280,00:51:57.656,Happy birthday.
00:52:02.160,00:52:08.000,"The refractive faces of the glass, you see, they create a full wavelength dispersal, so if you look inside it, you can see..."
00:52:08.042,00:52:11.712,- Every possible color.
00:52:11.754,00:52:18.010,"Yeah. Remember you said that time God must be a painter, because of all the colors?"
00:52:19.845,00:52:21.513,I didn't think you were listening.
00:52:24.182,00:52:25.726,I'm always listening.
00:52:32.316,00:52:34.359,It's beautiful.
00:52:50.626,00:52:53.671,"Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment?"
00:52:53.712,00:52:57.633,"'Cause I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data."
00:53:03.305,00:53:11.105,"I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance."
00:53:15.233,00:53:16.694,Proof?
00:53:16.735,00:53:18.278,Verifiable data.
00:53:18.320,00:53:21.323,Um... OK.
00:53:23.492,00:53:26.453,"Well, how big is the universe?"
00:53:26.495,00:53:30.124,- Infinite.
00:53:30.166,00:53:32.001,I know because all the data indicate it.
00:53:32.043,00:53:33.335,- But it hasn't been proven yet?
00:53:33.377,00:53:35.504,You haven't seen it.
00:53:37.255,00:53:39.675,"- I don't, I just believe it."
00:53:42.178,00:53:43.846,"It's the same with love, I guess."
00:53:51.979,00:53:55.440,"Now, the part that you don't know..."
00:53:57.735,00:53:59.695,...is if I want to marry you.
00:54:18.130,00:54:19.840,Smile for the camera!
00:54:26.847,00:54:28.306,Well done!
00:54:28.348,00:54:29.725,"Oh, sweet pea."
00:54:29.767,00:54:31.476,- I love you.
00:54:31.518,00:54:33.020,"Hey, Sol."
00:54:47.451,00:54:49.327,- Bye!
00:55:20.358,00:55:21.986,Get In. Hurry.
00:55:25.906,00:55:27.365,They're following us.
00:55:32.163,00:55:33.747,Who's...
00:55:33.789,00:55:35.499,The drop's been compromised.
00:55:38.460,00:55:40.462,- Stay down.
00:56:07.698,00:56:11.493,"- Here, take this."
00:56:11.535,00:56:13.245,- Take the goddamn gun!
00:56:13.287,00:56:14.830,Son of a...
00:56:31.513,00:56:33.389,You stay back. Don't move.
00:57:29.154,00:57:30.572,Hi.
00:57:33.117,00:57:34.701,Where were you?
00:57:38.122,00:57:40.624,- Sol...
00:57:40.665,00:57:42.834,He said you left the office hours ago.
00:57:45.670,00:57:47.756,Why didn't you call me?
00:57:53.345,00:57:54.430,Are you all right?
00:58:03.772,00:58:05.690,Honey?
00:58:05.732,00:58:08.402,- John...
00:58:08.444,00:58:11.322,"Please, talk to me."
00:58:13.157,00:58:15.367,"John, open the door."
00:58:17.077,00:58:19.288,"Come on, open the door!"
00:58:19.330,00:58:21.498,Talk to me!
00:58:22.874,00:58:24.335,John!
00:58:24.376,00:58:26.920,Open the door!
00:59:28.815,00:59:30.401,John.
00:59:30.442,00:59:32.444,William.
00:59:32.486,00:59:35.406,This is not what I signed on for.
00:59:35.447,00:59:37.699,Every time a car backfires or a door slams...
00:59:37.741,00:59:40.869,"I understand, better than you could possibly imagine."
00:59:51.463,00:59:53.673,"You need to calm down, John."
00:59:53.715,00:59:56.051,Now listen to me.
00:59:53.715,00:59:58.845,"We're closing in on the bomb, in large part due to your work."
00:59:58.887,01:00:01.765,Now don't you think your fear is a small price to pay?
01:00:01.806,01:00:03.725,"William, my circumstance has changed."
01:00:03.767,01:00:06.644,Alicia's pregnant.
01:00:14.652,01:00:18.323,I told you attachments were dangerous.
01:00:18.365,01:00:20.576,You chose to marry the girl.
01:00:20.617,01:00:23.579,I did nothing to prevent it.
01:00:25.539,01:00:31.086,The best way to ensure everybody's safety is for you to continue your work.
01:00:32.837,01:00:36.174,"- Well, I'll just quit."
01:00:36.216,01:00:41.054,- Why would I not?
01:00:41.096,01:00:45.267,"You quit working for me, I quit working for you."
01:00:58.614,01:01:01.617,Parcher! Parcher!
01:01:06.497,01:01:07.872,"John, you all right?"
01:01:29.269,01:01:30.979,John?
01:01:31.021,01:01:32.356,Turn it off!
01:01:35.442,01:01:37.569,Why would you do that?
01:01:37.611,01:01:39.696,Why would you turn the light on?
01:01:39.737,01:01:40.905,What is wrong with you?
01:01:40.947,01:01:43.617,You have to go to your sister's.
01:01:43.659,01:01:46.370,I left the car out the back.
01:01:46.411,01:01:48.997,"No side streets, you stay where it's crowded."
01:01:49.039,01:01:50.790,"-John, I'm not going anywhere!"
01:01:50.832,01:01:52.876,"When you get to your sister's, you wait for me to call you."
01:01:52.917,01:01:54.378,"- No, I'm not going."
01:01:54.419,01:01:56.338,- I'm not leaving...
01:01:57.464,01:01:59.341,"Please, Alicia."
01:02:01.385,01:02:02.969,I'll explain when I can.
01:02:51.643,01:02:53.895,Uncle John!
01:02:56.147,01:02:59.651,"- Hey, baby girl!"
01:02:59.693,01:03:01.945,"Wow, someone needed a hug!"
01:03:03.655,01:03:08.744,"I saw you on the slate and I thought to myself, How can I miss seeing a guest lecture by the inimitable John Nash?"
01:03:12.664,01:03:13.998,What's wrong?
01:03:17.210,01:03:19.921,I got myself into something.
01:03:19.963,01:03:21.757,"Well, now you tell me, what is it?"
01:03:24.092,01:03:25.802,Welcome!
01:03:27.804,01:03:29.264,After?
01:03:35.979,01:03:50.285,"the... the zeroes, of the Reimann zeta function, correspond to singularities in space-time, singularities in space-time..."
01:03:54.372,01:03:55.957,And conventional number theory...
01:03:58.669,01:04:03.298,It breaks down in the face of relativistic exploration.
01:04:19.523,01:04:23.568,Sometimes our expectations are betrayed by the numbers.
01:04:23.610,01:04:28.990,Variables are impossible to assign any rational value.
01:04:49.135,01:04:50.721,Professor Nash!
01:05:01.022,01:05:03.066,- Hold it!
01:05:05.485,01:05:11.366,"Professor Nash, let's avoid a scene, shall we?"
01:05:11.408,01:05:15.078,- What do you want?
01:05:11.408,01:05:18.081,"- My name is Rosen, Dr. Rosen."
01:05:18.122,01:05:21.459,Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.
01:05:21.501,01:05:23.712,"I'd like you to come with me, John."
01:05:25.505,01:05:26.923,Just for a chat.
01:05:28.633,01:05:30.009,It appears I have no choice.
01:05:33.221,01:05:34.598,Ohh!
01:05:41.396,01:05:43.231,Help me! Somebody!
01:05:49.320,01:05:52.490,Help me! Get off me!
01:05:52.532,01:05:55.076,I know who you are!
01:05:55.118,01:05:56.494,"No, no, no, no, don't."
01:05:56.536,01:05:58.789,"Charles, they're Russians!"
01:05:58.830,01:06:00.457,Call somebody!
01:06:00.498,01:06:01.999,- They're Russians!
01:06:02.041,01:06:03.460,Get away from me.
01:06:03.501,01:06:05.253,Stay away from me!
01:06:13.344,01:06:15.305,All better.
01:06:18.725,01:06:21.269,- Everything's all right here.
01:06:23.396,01:06:24.564,Watch your head.
01:06:53.969,01:06:56.888,John? John?
01:06:58.556,01:06:59.850,Can you hear me?
01:07:14.280,01:07:16.449,Go easy now.
01:07:16.491,01:07:18.910,Thorazine takes a little while to wear off.
01:07:22.038,01:07:25.041,Sorry about the restraints.
01:07:25.082,01:07:27.418,You've got one hell of a right hook.
01:07:32.298,01:07:34.801,Macarthur Psychiatric Hospital.
01:07:37.595,01:07:39.389,I find that highly unlikely.
01:07:40.682,01:07:42.017,You made a mistake.
01:07:44.060,01:07:46.312,My work is non-military in application.
01:07:46.354,01:07:48.732,"Which work is that, John?"
01:07:51.108,01:07:52.527,I don't know anything.
01:07:52.569,01:07:55.488,"in keeping secrets, you know."
01:08:11.963,01:08:12.797,Charles?
01:08:15.299,01:08:16.551,Charles?
01:08:19.054,01:08:20.513,I didn't mean to get you involved in this.
01:08:22.306,01:08:23.934,I'm... I'm sorry.
01:08:29.272,01:08:31.399,Charles...?
01:08:38.782,01:08:41.034,The prodigal roommate revealed.
01:08:43.620,01:08:45.705,Saw my name on the lecture slate?
01:08:45.747,01:08:48.541,You lying son of a bitch!
01:08:48.583,01:08:51.168,Who are you talking to?
01:08:51.210,01:08:53.212,"How do you say, Charles Herman in Russian?"
01:08:53.254,01:08:56.591,How do you say it in Russian?
01:08:56.633,01:08:59.427,"There's no one there, John."
01:08:59.469,01:09:01.930,He's right there.
01:09:01.972,01:09:05.642,Stop! I don't know anything!
01:09:05.683,01:09:08.311,Stop! I...
01:09:10.480,01:09:13.900,My name is John Nash.
01:09:13.942,01:09:16.694,Somebody call the Department of Defense.
01:09:16.736,01:09:20.782,My name is John Nash.
01:09:26.496,01:09:28.790,What's wrong with him?
01:09:31.668,01:09:35.005,John has schizophrenia.
01:09:35.046,01:09:37.882,People with this disorder are often paranoid.
01:09:39.467,01:09:42.386,But... But his work.
01:09:42.428,01:09:44.764,He deals with conspiracies...
01:09:46.432,01:09:48.476,"Yes, yes, I know."
01:09:48.518,01:09:54.524,"In John's world, these behaviors are... accepted, encouraged."
01:09:54.565,01:10:00.780,"As such, his illness may have gone untreated far longer than is typical."
01:10:00.822,01:10:02.490,What do you mean? How long?
01:10:02.532,01:10:04.575,Possibly since graduate school?
01:10:04.617,01:10:07.537,At least that's when his hallucinations seem to have begun.
01:10:07.578,01:10:10.498,What are you talking about?
01:10:10.540,01:10:12.458,"One, so far, that I am aware of."
01:10:12.500,01:10:15.670,An imaginary roommate named Charles Herman.
01:10:17.755,01:10:19.674,Charles isn't imaginary.
01:10:19.716,01:10:22.552,He and John have been best friends since Princeton.
01:10:22.593,01:10:24.929,Have you ever met Charles?
01:10:24.971,01:10:28.099,"He's always in town for so little time, lecturing."
01:10:28.141,01:10:31.061,- Was he at your wedding?
01:10:31.102,01:10:35.690,"Have you ever seen a picture of him, - talked to him on the telephone?"
01:10:35.732,01:10:37.817,I phoned Princeton.
01:10:37.859,01:10:40.737,"According to their housing records, John lived alone."
01:10:44.490,01:10:53.083,"Now, which is more likely, that your husband, a mathematician with no military training, is a government spy fleeing the Russians..."
01:10:53.124,01:10:55.210,You're making him sound crazy.
01:10:55.251,01:10:57.545,...or that he has lost his grip on reality?
01:11:00.548,01:11:07.430,Now the only way I can help him is to show him the difference between what's real and what is in his mind.
01:11:11.475,01:11:13.061,Come on.
01:11:14.395,01:11:16.439,What's he been working on?
01:11:18.357,01:11:19.901,His work is classified.
01:11:19.943,01:11:24.530,He mentioned a supervisor by the name of William Parcher.
01:11:24.572,01:11:27.992,Maybe Mr. Parcher can clarify things for us.
01:11:28.034,01:11:31.829,But I can't get to him without clearances.
01:11:31.871,01:11:35.541,You want me to help you get the details of my husband's work?
01:11:35.583,01:11:39.295,John thinks I'm a Russian spy.
01:11:39.336,01:11:40.755,Is that what you think?
01:11:45.468,01:11:47.929,- What did the doctor say?
01:11:47.971,01:11:51.224,I don't know. I want to see what John's been working on.
01:11:51.266,01:11:54.310,- You know you can't go in his office.
01:11:54.351,01:11:56.687,Stop. Oh!
01:12:10.034,01:12:11.577,"Oh, my God."
01:12:15.539,01:12:17.667,"Oh, my God."
01:12:25.258,01:12:27.593,Why didn't you say something?
01:12:27.635,01:12:33.308,"Alicia, John's always been a little weird."
01:12:33.349,01:12:37.812,"He said he was doing code-breaking, that it was eyes-only."
01:12:37.854,01:12:40.731,"- Top secret, part of the military effort."
01:12:40.773,01:12:43.818,"Well, it was possible, you know?"
01:12:43.860,01:12:46.362,Directives come down all the time that some of us aren't cleared for.
01:12:46.403,01:12:49.991,- It was possible.
01:12:52.451,01:12:57.165,"Lately, he'd become so much more agitated and then when you called..."
01:12:57.207,01:13:00.417,"So, is this all he's been doing every day?"
01:13:00.459,01:13:02.461,Cutting out magazines?
01:13:04.588,01:13:06.423,"Well, not all."
01:14:35.179,01:14:37.265,- I missed you.
01:14:39.767,01:14:42.770,- I have to talk to you.
01:14:48.151,01:15:02.373,"Alicia, I've been thinking about it, and I do realize that my behavior and my inability to discuss the situation with you must have appeared insane."
01:15:02.415,01:15:07.086,"I do understand, - and I'm truly sorry."
01:15:09.172,01:15:10.673,Everything's gonna be all right.
01:15:12.716,01:15:14.051,Everything's gonna be all right.
01:15:15.428,01:15:19.140,We just have to talk quietly.
01:15:19.182,01:15:23.478,They may be listening.
01:15:23.519,01:15:26.272,I'm gonna tell you everything now.
01:15:26.314,01:15:33.779,"It's breaking with protocol but you need to know, because you have to help me get out of here."
01:15:36.491,01:15:39.202,I've been doing top-secret work for the government.
01:15:39.243,01:15:43.039,There's a threat that exists of catastrophic proportions.
01:15:44.999,01:15:48.002,I think the Russians feel my profile is too high.
01:15:48.044,01:15:49.712,That's why they simply just don't do away with me.
01:15:49.753,01:15:54.091,They're keeping me here to try to stop me from doing my work.
01:15:54.133,01:15:56.052,- You have to find William Parcher.
01:15:56.093,01:15:58.513,- He can help us.
01:16:03.393,01:16:07.522,- I went to Wheeler.
01:16:07.563,01:16:12.193,- There is no William Parcher.
01:16:12.235,01:16:14.320,- I've been working for him.
01:16:14.362,01:16:18.324,Breaking codes?
01:16:14.362,01:16:20.410,Dropping packages in a secret mailbox for the government to pick up?
01:16:22.370,01:16:25.498,- How could you know that?
01:16:27.542,01:16:29.460,- He thought it was harmless.
01:16:38.469,01:16:40.721,They've never been opened.
01:16:43.474,01:16:46.561,It isn't real.
01:16:46.602,01:16:49.355,"There is no conspiracy, John."
01:16:52.649,01:16:54.527,There is no William Parcher.
01:16:56.070,01:16:57.821,It's in your mind.
01:17:00.408,01:17:03.411,"Do you understand, baby?"
01:17:04.995,01:17:06.872,You're sick.
01:17:09.542,01:17:11.710,"You're sick, John."
01:17:11.752,01:17:13.254,John?!
01:17:13.296,01:17:15.256,John!
01:17:23.013,01:17:25.099,Code red.
01:17:25.141,01:17:28.060,"Dr. Rosen, code red."
01:17:28.102,01:17:30.938,"Dr. Rosen, code red."
01:17:42.950,01:17:44.368,John?
01:17:46.829,01:17:48.456,John?
01:17:50.625,01:17:53.002,The implant's gone.
01:17:53.043,01:17:54.878,I can't find it.
01:17:59.175,01:18:01.302,It's gone.
01:18:32.583,01:18:38.130,nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what's true.
01:18:38.172,01:18:53.688,"Imagine if you had suddenly learned that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse: Had never been."
01:18:56.357,01:18:59.026,What kind of hell would that be?
01:19:05.157,01:19:06.742,Administering insulin.
01:20:07.595,01:20:10.055,How often?
01:20:12.057,01:20:14.435,Five times a week for ten weeks.
01:20:38.041,01:20:40.503,spoke so fondly of being here at Princeton.
01:20:42.588,01:20:43.839,And Hansen is running the department now.
01:20:43.880,01:20:45.800,"So he keeps reminding us, and reminding us."
01:20:45.841,01:20:49.052,- Yeah.
01:20:49.094,01:20:51.472,"John won't come near the campus, though."
01:20:51.514,01:20:54.809,- I think he's ashamed.
01:20:54.850,01:20:57.436,Hey. Hey.
01:20:57.478,01:20:59.896,Want this?
01:20:59.938,01:21:02.983,"So, Alicia, how..."
01:21:04.777,01:21:07.530,"Well, the delusions have passed."
01:21:07.571,01:21:09.782,They're saying with the medication and low stress environment...
01:21:09.824,01:21:13.327,"No, I..."
01:21:21.210,01:21:26.507,I think often what I feel is obligation.
01:21:28.676,01:21:31.345,Or guilt over wanting to leave.
01:21:33.096,01:21:37.267,"Rage against John, against God and..."
01:21:38.935,01:21:40.312,But...
01:21:43.691,01:21:50.573,...then I look at him and I force myself to see the man that I married.
01:21:52.324,01:21:53.950,And he becomes that man.
01:21:53.992,01:21:58.288,He's transformed into someone that I love.
01:22:01.417,01:22:03.878,And I'm transformed into someone who loves him.
01:22:07.172,01:22:09.842,"It's not all the time, but..."
01:22:12.386,01:22:13.888,...it's enough.
01:22:13.929,01:22:18.392,"I think John is a very lucky man, Alicia."
01:22:23.439,01:22:25.566,So unlucky.
01:22:30.446,01:22:32.907,- It's nice.
01:22:32.948,01:22:35.951,You've a visitor.
01:22:39.204,01:22:42.625,- Hi.
01:22:42.666,01:22:44.627,I hope it's OK.
01:22:52.468,01:22:54.887,"Hey ya, chief."
01:22:54.929,01:22:57.347,- Cigarette?
01:22:57.389,01:22:59.433,"I quit, actually."
01:23:03.520,01:23:05.564,- Hello.
01:23:07.775,01:23:11.361,- Have you met Harvey?
01:23:11.403,01:23:15.658,"- Relax, it's OK."
01:23:15.699,01:23:17.534,There's no point in being nuts if you can't have a little fun.
01:23:17.576,01:23:20.287,"Jesus Christ, John."
01:23:22.289,01:23:23.457,Here you go.
01:23:25.375,01:23:27.628,I can take those later.
01:23:27.670,01:23:30.881,You're supposed to take them now.
01:23:30.923,01:23:33.425,- Can I bring you something?
01:23:34.259,01:23:35.594,OK.
01:23:39.306,01:23:43.393,"So, um... yeah."
01:23:43.435,01:23:48.231,I go back tonight.
01:23:43.435,01:23:52.402,"You know, Bender, he really wanted to stop by and you know, see you. You know, say hi."
01:23:52.444,01:23:57.282,- Squeamish?
01:23:57.324,01:24:01.328,"I suppose I would be, too."
01:24:05.415,01:24:08.002,- I'm trying to solve the Reimann Hypothesis.
01:24:09.503,01:24:13.423,"- Oh, yeah?"
01:24:13.465,01:24:16.510,"If I dazzle them, they will have to reinstate me."
01:24:18.387,01:24:25.477,"But it's difficult with the medication, because it's hard to..."
01:24:28.063,01:24:29.690,...see the solution.
01:24:38.407,01:24:40.784,"You know, John, you should go easy."
01:24:40.826,01:24:44.538,There are other things besides...
01:24:47.624,01:24:49.292,What are they?
01:25:07.269,01:25:09.271,Shh-hh.
01:25:09.897,01:25:12.066,Shh.
01:25:25.537,01:25:27.039,What are you thinking about?
01:25:30.667,01:25:34.880,- What do people do?
01:25:34.922,01:25:39.259,"Activities available, just add meaning."
01:25:47.017,01:25:49.019,You could try leaving the house.
01:25:50.562,01:25:52.982,"You know, maybe..."
01:25:53.023,01:25:54.817,...talk to people.
01:26:00.238,01:26:01.573,You could try taking out the garbage.
01:26:23.595,01:26:26.222,And there's some more...
01:26:39.235,01:26:41.571,Who... Who were you talking to?
01:26:42.823,01:26:44.240,Garbage man.
01:26:53.625,01:26:55.335,Garbage men don't come at night.
01:26:58.047,01:27:00.007,I guess around here they do.
01:27:26.241,01:27:28.368,Sorry.
01:28:35.144,01:28:37.229,the medication?
01:29:17.477,01:29:19.938,I don't know what to do.
01:29:38.581,01:29:40.750,My mother's going to keep the baby a little longer tonight.
01:29:42.502,01:29:44.338,I can get three hours of overtime.
01:30:11.073,01:30:12.448,I'm going to bed.
01:30:19.455,01:30:21.917,- Good night.
01:31:40.578,01:31:42.289,"It's good to see you, John."
01:31:43.415,01:31:45.792,It's been a while.
01:31:46.876,01:31:50.046,- Parcher?
01:31:53.633,01:31:55.260,You're not real!
01:31:55.302,01:31:57.762,Of course I am.
01:32:02.892,01:32:04.978,"I don't think that I would go that way, John."
01:32:06.729,01:32:09.523,It's time for you to get back to work.
01:32:09.565,01:32:12.568,is in its final position here in the U.S.
01:32:14.946,01:32:22.704,"Knowing your situation requires you keep a low profile, Mohammed, we've brought the mountain to you."
01:32:42.765,01:32:46.269,We've narrowed the bomb's location to somewhere on the eastern seaboard.
01:32:48.562,01:32:50.815,But we haven't been able to pinpoint its exact position.
01:32:53.527,01:32:56.321,Their codes have grown increasingly complex.
01:32:58.614,01:33:00.534,"Here, look at this, John."
01:33:03.328,01:33:06.456,What? What?
01:33:09.459,01:33:12.337,- Dr. Rosen said...
01:33:12.379,01:33:14.881,"Schizophrenic break from reality, right?"
01:33:14.923,01:33:18.218,Psychological bullshit!
01:33:19.677,01:33:21.346,"John, look at me."
01:33:23.639,01:33:25.308,Do I look like I'm imagined?
01:33:27.643,01:33:29.896,Wheeler has no record of you.
01:33:29.938,01:33:32.023,Do you think we list our personnel?
01:33:34.317,01:33:36.570,"John, I'm sorry you had to go through all this."
01:33:38.530,01:33:41.157,I've gone to a great deal of trouble to get you back.
01:33:41.199,01:33:44.286,I can restore your status at Wheeler.
01:33:44.327,01:33:46.580,I can let the world know what you did.
01:33:46.620,01:33:48.873,"But I need you now, soldier."
01:33:55.380,01:33:57.466,I was so scared you weren't real.
01:34:06.349,01:34:07.934,There's a storm coming.
01:34:07.976,01:34:10.228,"I'm just going to grab the laundry, OK?"
01:34:10.270,01:34:11.938,I'll draw his bath.
01:34:15.400,01:34:17.277,It's OK.
01:34:18.861,01:34:20.405,OK.
01:35:59.003,01:36:00.505,John!
01:36:07.011,01:36:09.639,I've almost got it!
01:36:09.681,01:36:10.973,- I've got one more to close!
01:36:11.015,01:36:12.975,- No!
01:36:13.017,01:36:15.228,"- Oh, God."
01:36:19.190,01:36:20.734,I need a towel.
01:36:21.817,01:36:23.319,Shhh.
01:36:23.361,01:36:25.321,Charles was watching him.
01:36:25.363,01:36:29.033,There is no one here.
01:36:29.075,01:36:30.326,- Charles was watching him.
01:36:30.368,01:36:32.537,He's been injected with a cloaking serum.
01:36:32.579,01:36:37.833,I can see him because of a chemical that was released into my bloodstream when my implant dissolved.
01:36:40.378,01:36:42.255,"I couldn't tell you, it was for your own protection!"
01:36:44.466,01:36:45.759,Alicia!
01:36:50.555,01:36:53.933,- No!
01:36:53.975,01:36:55.477,"You've got to stop her, John."
01:36:57.646,01:36:59.522,You leave her out of this.
01:37:01.441,01:37:04.110,- Who are you talking to?
01:37:04.152,01:37:06.112,- John.
01:37:06.154,01:37:08.281,"- No, she won't."
01:37:08.323,01:37:10.992,"- John, answer me!"
01:37:11.033,01:37:12.494,"Alicia, please, put the phone down."
01:37:12.535,01:37:14.996,- I can't let that happen.
01:37:15.037,01:37:17.499,"Hi, I need Dr. Rosen."
01:37:17.540,01:37:20.251,"I'm sorry, John."
01:37:26.090,01:37:28.510,- Alicia?
01:37:28.551,01:37:30.970,- Get away from me.
01:37:31.012,01:37:33.264,- Get away!
01:37:33.306,01:37:34.808,I didn't mean to hurt you!
01:37:36.976,01:37:39.020,Finish her.
01:37:43.149,01:37:44.776,Uncle John?
01:37:44.818,01:37:49.863,"you pathetic piece of shit, - or I'll take care of you."
01:37:46.902,01:37:52.241,"- John, Christ, John, please do what he says."
01:37:52.283,01:37:53.993,"Move, soldier."
01:37:55.328,01:37:56.705,Now.
01:38:01.917,01:38:03.919,Now!
01:38:03.961,01:38:06.715,and Charles never co-exist in the same interactive field.
01:38:17.099,01:38:20.061,"...Charles, and Marcee cannot co-exist with Alicia."
01:38:20.102,01:38:21.979,I understand.
01:38:38.246,01:38:39.706,She never gets old.
01:38:42.958,01:38:46.212,Marcee can't be real.
01:39:19.370,01:39:20.580,You see them now?
01:39:29.923,01:39:31.674,Yes.
01:39:34.051,01:39:35.804,Why did you stop your meds?
01:39:37.931,01:39:40.475,Because I couldn't do my work.
01:39:40.516,01:39:43.603,I couldn't help with the baby.
01:39:46.230,01:39:48.274,I couldn't respond to my wife.
01:39:51.736,01:39:53.237,You think that's better than being crazy?
01:39:53.279,01:39:58.451,We'll need to start you on a higher run of insulin shocks and a new medication.
01:39:58.493,01:40:01.788,No. There has to be another way.
01:40:01.830,01:40:04.499,is degenerative.
01:40:04.540,01:40:08.252,"Some days may be symptom-free, but over time, you are getting worse."
01:40:08.294,01:40:12.131,It's a problem.
01:40:12.173,01:40:14.258,It's a problem with no solution.
01:40:14.300,01:40:16.218,"And that's what I do, I solve problems."
01:40:16.260,01:40:17.470,- That's what I do best.
01:40:17.512,01:40:20.765,come up with a formula to change the way you experience the world.
01:40:20.807,01:40:22.809,All I have to do is apply my mind.
01:40:22.851,01:40:24.811,"There's no theorem, no proof."
01:40:24.853,01:40:26.980,- You can't reason your way out of this.
01:40:27.020,01:40:29.899,Because your mind is where the problem is in the first place.
01:40:31.567,01:40:34.946,I can do this.
01:40:34.988,01:40:37.824,I can work it out.
01:40:40.451,01:40:42.620,Is that the baby?
01:40:45.331,01:40:47.416,"The baby's at my mother's, John."
01:41:01.514,01:41:06.059,"treatment, John, the fantasies may take over..."
01:41:07.395,01:41:08.688,...entirely.
01:41:31.335,01:41:32.545,Rosen's waiting outside.
01:41:34.047,01:41:35.924,I can't go back to that hospital.
01:41:40.093,01:41:41.888,I won't come home.
01:41:45.266,01:41:51.647,"He said that if you said that, he has commitment papers for me to sign."
01:41:54.316,01:41:56.360,"Well, maybe you won't sign them."
01:41:58.446,01:42:00.322,Maybe you'll just give me some time.
01:42:02.784,01:42:05.078,I will try to figure this out.
01:42:07.580,01:42:12.376,"Whatever you do, Rosen is right about one thing."
01:42:13.628,01:42:15.421,You shouldn't be here.
01:42:17.339,01:42:19.467,I'm not safe anymore.
01:42:25.389,01:42:27.391,"Would you have hurt me, John?"
01:42:36.985,01:42:38.945,I don't know.
01:42:38.987,01:42:42.323,Maybe you should let Dr. Rosen drive you to your mother's.
01:43:49.598,01:43:52.309,Rosen said to call if you try and kill me or anything.
01:44:09.577,01:44:11.037,You want to know what's real?
01:44:16.291,01:44:18.044,This.
01:44:25.634,01:44:27.720,This.
01:44:33.726,01:44:35.268,This.
01:44:37.230,01:44:38.731,This is real.
01:44:42.735,01:44:50.243,"Maybe the part that knows the waking from the dream, maybe it isn't here."
01:44:54.205,01:44:55.915,Maybe it's here.
01:45:01.629,01:45:06.508,I need to believe that something extraordinary is possible.
01:46:20.499,01:46:22.001,"Hello, Martin."
01:46:27.256,01:46:28.883,Jesus Christ.
01:46:30.467,01:46:32.303,No. I...
01:46:33.637,01:46:35.223,I don't have that one.
01:46:33.637,01:46:36.932,My savior complex takes on a completely different form.
01:46:39.185,01:46:45.858,"I heard what happened and, well, I... I wanted to write and I tried you at Macarthur's but you'd left, and I just..."
01:46:58.287,01:47:00.289,This is Helinger's old office.
01:47:00.331,01:47:03.751,Yeah.
01:47:07.088,01:47:09.590,"Seems that you won after all, Martin."
01:47:11.592,01:47:13.761,"They were wrong, John."
01:47:13.802,01:47:16.513,"Please, please have a seat."
01:47:16.555,01:47:19.558,"God, it's so good to see you."
01:47:22.561,01:47:24.646,What brings you back to Princeton?
01:47:26.065,01:47:29.235,"John, I'm sorry, but you have to tell him."
01:47:29.277,01:47:31.444,Tell him you're a genius.
01:47:31.486,01:47:33.948,"Tell him your work is critical. John, please!"
01:47:49.338,01:47:51.966,Is there any chance that you could ignore what I just did?
01:47:53.968,01:47:56.845,"Of course, what are old friends for?"
01:47:58.471,01:48:00.515,"Is that what we are, Martin?"
01:48:00.557,01:48:05.313,"John, of course. Of course."
01:48:10.359,01:48:12.861,Alicia and I think that...
01:48:12.903,01:48:23.122,"That fitting in, being part of a community, might do me some good."
01:48:19.701,01:48:28.169,"That a certain level of attachment, familiar places, familiar people, might help me..."
01:48:28.210,01:48:30.671,...elbow out these...
01:48:33.882,01:48:36.469,These certain delusions that I have.
01:48:42.266,01:48:49.023,"It's a lot to ask, and now that I'm here, I'm quite certain that you will just say no."
01:48:52.567,01:48:54.862,But I was wondering if I could hang around.
01:49:04.163,01:49:05.622,Huh.
01:49:09.377,01:49:11.253,Will you be needing an office?
01:49:14.923,01:49:17.009,No.
01:49:20.221,01:49:23.349,"No, I could just work out of the library."
01:49:23.391,01:49:28.770,"Well, this guy tries to wander into the library, - but he doesn't have I.D."
01:49:28.812,01:49:31.524,Then he goes totally nuts.
01:49:31.564,01:49:34.693,You're not real.
01:49:34.735,01:49:38.447,- There's no mission.
01:49:38.489,01:49:41.534,Not real!
01:49:41.574,01:49:46.205,"Is this what you are, soldier?"
01:49:46.247,01:49:49.083,- I'm not a soldier.
01:49:49.124,01:49:52.753,"- Old, worthless, discarded."
01:49:52.794,01:49:55.797,"And while you rock and drool, the world will burn to ashes!"
01:49:55.839,01:49:58.800,You are not real!
01:49:58.842,01:50:00.677,"You're still talking to me, soldier."
01:50:00.719,01:50:03.097,There's no mission!
01:50:03.138,01:50:05.766,John? John?
01:50:05.807,01:50:07.518,"John, John, John, John."
01:50:07.560,01:50:09.144,"Hey, hey, hey."
01:50:09.186,01:50:11.439,"John, John! It's OK."
01:50:11.480,01:50:12.689,"I just heard what happened, I'm sorry. John..."
01:50:12.731,01:50:14.733,- I'm not a soldier.
01:50:14.775,01:50:17.570,"Nash, hey."
01:50:20.697,01:50:23.033,"Nash, Nash, hey, hey, hey."
01:50:26.203,01:50:29.123,"Ladies and gentlemen, the great John Nash!"
01:50:32.501,01:50:34.336,seen their faces.
01:50:36.130,01:50:38.090,Everybody was just staring at me.
01:50:38.132,01:50:42.761,"John, you know that stress triggers the delusions."
01:50:42.803,01:50:44.597,I know.
01:50:46.974,01:50:51.312,"But then, on the way home, Charles was there."
01:50:56.400,01:50:58.777,"Sometimes, I really miss talking to him."
01:51:02.697,01:51:04.575,Maybe Rosen's right.
01:51:04.617,01:51:08.245,Maybe I have to think about going back into the hospital again.
01:51:08.287,01:51:10.289,No.
01:51:10.331,01:51:11.999,Come here.
01:51:16.211,01:51:18.046,Maybe try again tomorrow.
01:51:43.322,01:51:46.325,"John, now, you can't ignore me forever."
01:51:52.122,01:51:53.999,"Charles, you've been a very good friend to me."
01:51:54.041,01:51:56.001,The best.
01:51:58.295,01:51:59.672,But I won't talk to you again.
01:52:03.091,01:52:05.010,I just can't.
01:52:10.974,01:52:13.352,"Same goes for you, baby girl."
01:52:21.235,01:52:22.903,Goodbye.
01:52:30.327,01:52:31.620,Goodbye.
01:52:46.552,01:52:48.053,I was wondering if I might audit your course.
01:52:49.638,01:52:52.725,"It's... It's an honor, Professor Nash."
01:52:56.270,01:52:57.896,Is something wrong?
01:52:59.940,01:53:01.942,This will be my first class.
01:53:05.237,01:53:09.450,"Good morning, eager young minds."
01:53:29.802,01:53:32.097,"It's never gonna work, John."
01:53:32.139,01:53:34.767,You're just humiliating yourself.
01:53:37.352,01:53:38.771,It's pathetic!
01:53:38.811,01:53:41.356,You are being pathetic.
01:53:41.398,01:53:43.275,I'm ashamed of you.
01:54:11.219,01:54:13.013,"Oh, man!"
01:54:16.642,01:54:19.394,Are you coming?
01:54:22.314,01:54:24.483,"- Dad, you've got my book."
01:54:24.525,01:54:28.153,- You've got my book.
01:54:28.195,01:54:30.572,Thanks.
01:54:30.614,01:54:32.324,- Goodbye.
01:54:34.242,01:54:36.453,"Bye, honey."
01:56:09.254,01:56:10.756,Did you just solve Reimann?
01:56:10.798,01:56:12.716,"Well, what do you think?"
01:56:12.758,01:56:18.305,Huh. That's an analog to Frobenius for noncommutative extensions.
01:56:18.346,01:56:21.099,"- Yes, it is."
01:56:21.141,01:56:25.520,"But it only appears to work sporadically, so, no."
01:56:27.063,01:56:28.649,I believe I'm making progress.
01:56:30.317,01:56:34.947,You're...
01:56:37.574,01:56:39.743,- Toby Kelly.
01:56:39.785,01:56:41.745,I've been studying your equilibrium.
01:56:41.787,01:56:43.371,"The one you wrote here, at Princeton."
01:56:43.413,01:56:48.126,"To come up with something totally original, - the way you did..."
01:56:48.168,01:56:51.797,Umm... I've been developing a theory.
01:57:05.686,01:57:11.232,I believe I can prove that Galois extensions are covering spaces.
01:57:11.274,01:57:13.777,"That everything, everything is connected."
01:57:13.819,01:57:16.112,That it's all part of the same subject.
01:57:16.154,01:57:18.699,When was the last time you ate?
01:57:18.740,01:57:21.869,- Excuse me?
01:57:21.910,01:57:26.247,"- Oh, uh..."
01:57:21.910,01:57:31.294,"- My wife, - she loves mayonnaise."
01:57:31.336,01:57:33.588,Thank you.
01:57:33.630,01:57:36.967,- Go on.
01:57:37.009,01:57:39.636,- ...is in the two categories.
01:57:45.726,01:57:48.353,Alicia!
01:57:48.395,01:57:50.355,at maximum speed of...
01:57:50.397,01:57:53.483,...let us say ten miles per hour.
01:57:53.525,01:58:08.498,"So you have a fly on the tire of bicycle B, and the fly, who can travel at 20 miles an hour, leaves the tire of bicycle B and it flies to the tire of bicycle A and backwards and forwards and so on and so forth until the two bikes collide and the poor little fly is squashed."
01:58:08.540,01:58:14.629,- This is the important thing about actually focusing in and comprehending the area that you're dealing with.
01:58:14.671,01:58:21.803,"Mathematics is very specific, and it is an art form, no matter what these people around here will tell you, especially the people from biology."
01:58:21.845,01:58:23.346,Don't listen to any of those people.
01:58:23.388,01:58:25.515,Let me go back to what you were doing before.
01:58:25.557,01:58:28.226,"I might want to steal this, write a book and get famous."
01:58:30.062,01:58:31.897,I was thinking that I might teach.
01:58:34.190,01:58:37.277,A classroom with 50 students can be daunting for anyone.
01:58:38.779,01:58:41.907,"John, besides, you're a terrible teacher."
01:58:41.949,01:58:45.660,"I'm an acquired taste, Martin."
01:58:45.702,01:58:48.663,I was hoping there still might be something I could contribute.
01:58:48.705,01:58:51.499,What about the...
01:58:51.541,01:58:54.878,"Well, you know."
01:59:01.760,01:59:04.554,"No, they're not gone."
01:59:04.596,01:59:06.306,And maybe they never will be.
01:59:06.347,01:59:10.477,But I've gotten used to ignoring them and I think as a result they've kind of given up on me.
01:59:12.186,01:59:17.150,"You think that's what it's like with all our dreams and our nightmares, Martin?"
01:59:17.191,01:59:20.278,You've got to keep feeding them for them to stay alive?
01:59:20.320,01:59:24.574,"John, they..."
01:59:24.616,01:59:27.619,"They're my past, Martin."
01:59:31.123,01:59:33.792,"Well, goodbye."
01:59:33.834,01:59:37.004,"John, I'll talk to the department."
01:59:38.421,01:59:39.798,Maybe in the spring.
01:59:45.261,01:59:46.888,"Hey, Nash?"
01:59:48.723,01:59:50.308,You...
01:59:51.601,01:59:52.936,You scared?
01:59:55.480,01:59:57.357,Terrified.
01:59:57.398,01:59:59.693,Mortified.
01:59:59.734,02:00:01.611,Stupefied by you.
02:00:01.653,02:00:06.658,"Now you ought best ring Alicia, - or you're gonna get me..."
02:00:06.700,02:00:07.617,...in an awful lot of trouble.
02:00:11.538,02:00:13.165,"- Thanks, professor."
02:00:13.206,02:00:15.375,- Have a nice day.
02:00:15.416,02:00:17.585,"Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer."
02:00:17.627,02:00:19.379,Professor Nash?
02:00:23.424,02:00:25.969,- Can you see him?
02:00:26.011,02:00:27.679,- You sure?
02:00:27.721,02:00:29.430,Positive?
02:00:29.472,02:00:32.017,- OK. Good.
02:00:32.059,02:00:34.477,"Forgive me, I'm just always suspicious of new people."
02:00:34.519,02:00:36.521,"- See you next week, professor."
02:00:38.732,02:00:42.402,"So now that I know that you're real, who are you, and what can I do for you?"
02:00:42.443,02:00:46.114,"Professor, my name is Thomas King..."
02:00:46.156,02:00:47.490,- Thomas King?
02:00:47.532,02:00:51.327,...and I'm here to tell you that you're being considered for the Nobel prize.
02:00:59.460,02:01:02.296,just a little stunned.
02:01:02.338,02:01:06.968,your equilibrium has become a cornerstone of modern economics.
02:01:07.010,02:01:09.846,Suddenly everybody likes that one.
02:01:09.888,02:01:14.184,"What about my work on other some such projects, manifold embedding?"
02:01:14.226,02:01:21.566,The application of your bargaining problem to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions or to antitrust cases...
02:01:21.608,02:01:23.317,- Antitrust cases?
02:01:23.359,02:01:25.737,I never would have considered that.
02:01:25.779,02:01:27.906,- Well...
02:01:25.779,02:01:30.951,- Have I just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?
02:01:30.992,02:01:32.660,you haven't.
02:01:32.702,02:01:34.495,"'Cause, I wouldn't have thought of that."
02:01:39.751,02:01:41.628,Shall we have tea?
02:01:43.755,02:01:45.924,"Oh, I don't go in there."
02:01:43.755,02:01:49.343,I usually just take my sandwich in the library.
02:01:49.385,02:01:51.512,"Come on, John."
02:01:51.554,02:01:58.645,M-Most... Most commercially available brands of tea are not suitable to my palate.
02:01:58.686,02:02:02.774,There are some northern Indian teas which are dense enough...
02:02:02.816,02:02:05.485,I enjoy the flavor that they have...
02:02:05.526,02:02:08.488,I have not been in this room for some many years.
02:02:08.529,02:02:10.115,I wonder what tea they serve.
02:02:12.659,02:02:14.452,young lady.
02:02:16.246,02:02:18.414,Things have certainly changed around here.
02:02:18.456,02:02:21.584,I have a son that age.
02:02:21.626,02:02:23.795,- Harvard.
02:02:23.837,02:02:25.255,Hmm.
02:02:28.133,02:02:34.681,I would have thought the nominations for the Nobel prize would have been secret.
02:02:34.722,02:02:37.517,I would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost.
02:02:37.558,02:02:40.020,"That is generally the case, yes."
02:02:40.061,02:02:41.938,But these are special circumstances.
02:02:43.898,02:02:45.775,The awards are substantial.
02:02:45.817,02:02:48.987,They require private funding.
02:02:45.817,02:02:53.074,"As such, the image of the Nobel is..."
02:02:54.993,02:02:58.079,I see. You came here to find out if I was crazy?
02:02:59.497,02:03:03.084,Find out if I would screw everything up if I actually won?
02:03:05.628,02:03:11.843,"Dance around the podium, strip naked and squawk like a chicken, - things of this nature?"
02:03:13.094,02:03:14.888,Would I embarrass you?
02:03:18.350,02:03:20.310,"Yes, it is possible."
02:03:23.230,02:03:25.273,"You see, I..."
02:03:26.816,02:03:28.609,I am crazy.
02:03:30.528,02:03:38.912,"I take the newer medications, but I still see things that are not here."
02:03:41.248,02:03:46.044,I just choose not to acknowledge them.
02:03:46.086,02:03:50.257,"Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites."
02:03:53.134,02:03:55.053,Like my appetite for patterns.
02:03:57.471,02:04:01.601,Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.
02:04:08.358,02:04:10.568,"It's good to have you here, John."
02:04:10.610,02:04:12.987,Thank you.
02:04:17.575,02:04:21.413,"- It's an honor, sir."
02:04:21.454,02:04:23.581,"A privilege, professor."
02:04:28.336,02:04:29.754,Professor.
02:04:35.135,02:04:37.762,"- Nicely done, John."
02:04:39.306,02:04:40.681,Thank you.
02:04:41.975,02:04:43.393,Thank you.
02:04:52.277,02:04:53.987,"Thank you, Ed."
02:05:01.828,02:05:04.247,That was certainly most unexpected.
02:05:31.107,02:05:33.693,I've always believed in numbers.
02:05:35.528,02:05:39.073,In the equations and logics that lead to reason.
02:05:39.115,02:05:46.580,"But after a lifetime of such pursuits, I ask, what truly is logic?"
02:05:48.416,02:05:51.794,Who decides reason?
02:05:51.836,02:06:05.850,"My quest has taken me through the physical, the metaphysical, the delusional, and back."
02:06:05.892,02:06:08.269,And I have made the most important discovery of my career.
02:06:11.231,02:06:13.441,The most important discovery of my life.
02:06:16.694,02:06:22.909,It is only in the mysterious equations of love that any logical reasons can be found.
02:06:26.954,02:06:28.789,I'm only here tonight because of you.
02:06:31.418,02:06:33.002,You are the reason I am.
02:06:38.466,02:06:40.218,You are all my reasons.
02:06:44.180,02:06:46.057,Thank you.
02:07:40.736,02:07:41.988,So nice to have met you.
02:07:45.699,02:07:46.993,"I'll call for the car, Dad."
02:07:47.034,02:07:49.412,- Bye-bye.
02:07:49.454,02:07:53.458,- Are you ready to go now?
02:07:53.500,02:07:55.585,"Yes, indeed, and yes, please."
02:07:55.627,02:07:58.004,Thank you so much.
02:08:02.883,02:08:05.261,What is it? What's wrong?
02:08:09.182,02:08:11.225,Nothing.
02:08:11.267,02:08:12.893,Nothing at all.
02:08:15.229,02:08:17.815,"- Come with me, young lady."
02:08:17.857,02:08:20.693,I have a car outside.
02:08:20.734,02:08:23.446,Are you interested in a ride?
02:08:24.656,02:08:26.324,Where's it going to?
