00:01:35.470,00:01:37.347,Starting with borrowing a jacket.
00:02:16.136,00:02:19.431,"-Lovely, my dear. -Marvelous. Marvelous. Most enjoyable."
00:02:19.556,00:02:22.100,"Herbert Greenleaf. My wife, Emily."
00:02:22.225,00:02:23.602,Thank you. Tom Ripley.
00:02:23.685,00:02:25.395,-How do you do? -You were at Princeton.
00:02:25.479,00:02:28.815,"Most likely you'll know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf."
00:02:33.320,00:02:34.655,Class of '56.
00:02:37.616,00:02:38.784,How is Dickie?
00:02:41.370,00:02:43.872,"Well, I do hope that you'll come out and see us."
00:02:43.955,00:02:46.750,-Thank you. That's very kind. -Both of you.
00:02:47.075,00:02:49.995,"-Herbert? -Yes, yes. I very much hope so."
00:02:50.128,00:02:53.173,"Of course, Dickie's idea of music is jazz."
00:02:55.930,00:02:58.595,"To my ear, jazz is just noise."
00:02:58.804,00:03:00.806,Just an insolent noise.
00:03:01.013,00:03:03.140,-It was very nice to meet you. -And you.
00:03:04.226,00:03:05.686,-Sir. -We'll see you at the shipyard.
00:03:05.811,00:03:07.521,-I hope to. Okay. -Good.
00:03:10.065,00:03:11.817,I have to run! I'm very late!
00:03:13.819,00:03:15.946,"-Ah, you were great! -You were great."
00:03:17.656,00:03:19.574,"Darling couple, aren't they?"
00:03:19.700,00:03:22.494,"Yes, they are. Exceptional young man."
00:03:24.871,00:03:27.249,-Thanks a lot for the jacket. -Thanks for filling in for me.
00:03:27.332,00:03:29.126,"Take care of that wrist. Bye, Fran."
00:03:39.720,00:03:41.304,You'll make yourself a fortune.
00:04:20.051,00:04:21.762,Sorry. Sorry.
00:04:23.513,00:04:24.765,I know. Sorry.
00:04:28.602,00:04:31.188,"Mongibello, south of Naples."
00:04:31.313,00:04:33.398,No kind of place at all.
00:04:35.442,00:04:41.239,"Marge, his, um, young lady, is supposedly writing some kind of book."
00:04:41.323,00:04:43.074,God only knows what he does.
00:04:43.200,00:04:47.412,"By all accounts, they spend the whole time on the beach or in a sailboat."
00:04:47.496,00:04:50.373,"That's my son's talent, spending his allowance."
00:04:50.999,00:04:54.085,"Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom?"
00:04:54.586,00:04:57.506,Persuade my son to come home?
00:05:01.885,00:05:03.720,A thousand dollars.
00:05:06.473,00:05:11.520,"Well, I have always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but… Good."
00:05:12.395,00:05:13.814,Now you can go for a reason.
00:05:32.040,00:05:34.417,Duke Ellington? I don't know.
00:05:36.920,00:05:38.004,I don't know.
00:05:41.216,00:05:42.342,I don't know.
00:05:49.683,00:05:50.976,Dizzy Gillespie.
00:06:22.716,00:06:24.009,Charlie Parker?
00:06:24.759,00:06:26.970,Charlie Parker! I know it. It's Bird.
00:06:30.390,00:06:31.391,Yes!
00:06:55.916,00:06:57.959,-Here. I'll take it. -Thanks.
00:06:59.044,00:07:01.087,"That 1,000 bucks should come in handy."
00:07:01.254,00:07:02.714,"-Yes, sir. -I'll get that."
00:07:07.928,00:07:09.137,-Thank you. -Sir.
00:07:12.724,00:07:15.393,Mr. Greenleaf is personal friends with the Cunard people.
00:07:21.733,00:07:24.861,"I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors."
00:08:06.444,00:08:08.238,-Ripley. -Follow me. No problem.
00:08:09.030,00:08:11.116,"-Here, Signor Ripley. -Okay."
00:08:12.283,00:08:14.411,"Uh, there. That one."
00:08:18.081,00:08:20.083,"-Just one suitcase, Signor Ripley? -Si."
00:08:38.518,00:08:40.895,-What's your secret? -Excuse me?
00:08:40.979,00:08:43.982,"No, it's just that… You are American, aren't you?"
00:08:45.942,00:08:51.156,"I have so much luggage, and you're so, um, streamlined."
00:08:51.239,00:08:53.283,"It's, you know, humiliating."
00:08:55.827,00:08:57.287,"I'm Meredith, by the way."
00:08:58.038,00:08:59.247,"Hello, uh, Dickie."
00:09:00.498,00:09:01.833,Meredith Randall.
00:09:02.625,00:09:03.710,"Um, Dickie Greenleaf."
00:09:04.044,00:09:04.961,Hello.
00:09:07.756,00:09:09.758,You're not the shipping Greenleafs?
00:09:10.425,00:09:12.093,"Oh, trying not to be."
00:09:12.886,00:09:14.220,Trying to jump ship.
00:09:14.596,00:09:17.891,"So, now, uh, did they put your cases in the wrong pile?"
00:09:18.224,00:09:21.770,"It's just that, uh, you were in the R stand."
00:09:22.270,00:09:25.190,"Well, I thought I saw you there."
00:09:26.524,00:09:28.485,My father wants me back in New York.
00:09:29.736,00:09:31.821,He builds boats. I'd rather sail them.
00:09:32.614,00:09:34.365,So I travel under my mother's name.
00:09:34.949,00:09:37.452,-Which is… -Emily.
00:09:41.956,00:09:46.377,"You know, the funny thing is, I'm not Randall either."
00:09:47.962,00:09:49.005,I'm Logue.
00:09:49.964,00:09:52.634,-As in-- -As in the textile Logues.
00:09:53.093,00:09:55.845,Trying to shrug off the dress.
00:11:25.894,00:11:27.812,The fiancée has a face.
00:11:52.670,00:11:53.838,Bird.
00:11:57.884,00:11:59.844,This is my face.
00:12:38.758,00:12:40.343,It's just been too hot.
00:12:51.980,00:12:54.274,-maybe you could look at it then. -Dickie Greenleaf?
00:12:55.984,00:12:57.026,Who's that?
00:12:57.110,00:12:59.153,It's Tom. Tom Ripley.
00:12:59.988,00:13:01.114,Tom Ripley?
00:13:05.994,00:13:07.328,Did we know each other?
00:13:07.996,00:13:15.545,"Hello. Well, I knew you, so… Princeton's like a fog."
00:13:19.924,00:13:22.677,"This is Marge Sherwood. Tom… Sorry, what is it?"
00:13:30.685,00:13:31.894,Nothing much.
00:13:38.526,00:13:39.610,You're so white.
00:13:45.491,00:13:46.659,"Gray, actually."
00:13:55.418,00:13:56.586,That's funny.
00:13:57.503,00:13:59.714,"Margie likes that 'cause she's so white, too."
00:13:59.881,00:14:02.050,"Yes, I do, and you're not funny."
00:14:02.342,00:14:04.594,You should come and have lunch with us before you go.
00:14:04.677,00:14:06.387,"-Yes, Dickie? -Sure, anytime."
00:14:07.221,00:14:11.517,Well… Coincidence.
00:14:18.691,00:14:20.068,That's so funny.
00:14:30.912,00:14:32.830,I've been looking all over for you.
00:14:33.122,00:14:34.332,Where've you been hiding?
00:14:34.415,00:14:36.417,"-Yeah, today you're looking for me. -Huh?"
00:14:36.584,00:14:39.212,-Where you been the rest of the week? -You're always working.
00:14:43.007,00:14:46.219,-Huh? Hold on to me. -I hate you.
00:14:53.309,00:14:55.478,"I know, I'm late. I'm a swine."
00:14:55.812,00:14:57.605,-It's four o'clock. -I just woke up.
00:15:00.274,00:15:02.902,"-You just woke up. -Fausto and I, we took the boat out."
00:15:02.985,00:15:06.697,"We were fishing, and then it was dawn, and we'd caught absolutely nothing."
00:15:10.993,00:15:12.245,-We? -Yes.
00:15:13.413,00:15:16.040,-Tom Ripley's here. -Who?
00:15:20.044,00:15:21.087,Hello.
00:15:23.172,00:15:25.842,Thought you'd disappeared. We were gonna send out a search party.
00:15:27.176,00:15:28.386,"No, still here."
00:15:28.761,00:15:30.805,Tom was telling me about his journey over.
00:15:32.432,00:15:35.226,Made me laugh so hard I almost got a nosebleed.
00:15:35.560,00:15:36.436,Is that good?
00:15:39.313,00:15:40.314,I'm sorry.
00:15:40.815,00:15:41.941,I'm sorry.
00:15:42.150,00:15:44.652,I'm despicable. But I love you.
00:15:48.656,00:15:50.074,Can you mix a martini?
00:15:52.493,00:15:53.494,Sure.
00:15:55.580,00:15:56.664,Oh.
00:15:57.123,00:15:58.541,I make a fabulous martini.
00:16:03.546,00:16:06.507,Everybody should have one talent. What's yours?
00:16:06.966,00:16:12.138,"Forging signatures, uh… telling lies, impersonating practically anybody."
00:16:12.763,00:16:13.848,That's three.
00:16:14.098,00:16:15.975,Nobody should have more than one talent.
00:16:17.602,00:16:19.520,"Okay, do an impression."
00:16:20.146,00:16:22.148,-Now? -Yeah.
00:16:24.901,00:16:26.986,is for cashing his allowance.
00:16:30.656,00:16:32.366,"-What? -Oh, I like to sail."
00:16:32.450,00:16:34.785,"Believe me, I love to sail."
00:16:37.121,00:16:38.998,-Other people sail them. -It's too much!
00:16:39.081,00:16:41.000,You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up.
00:16:41.209,00:16:44.378,"Oh, yes. Jazz. Oh, jazz. Let's face it."
00:16:44.504,00:16:47.590,"It's just, uh… It's just insolent noise."
00:16:48.382,00:16:50.051,I feel like he's here!
00:16:50.218,00:16:52.512,"Horrible, like the old bastard's here right now."
00:16:52.595,00:16:53.554,Good.
00:16:53.888,00:16:54.931,That's brilliant.
00:16:57.683,00:17:00.144,"-How do you know him? -Oh, I met him in New York."
00:17:00.394,00:17:02.438,"Marge! Marge, this is scary."
00:17:02.730,00:17:03.940,You've got to hear this.
00:17:04.023,00:17:07.360,"Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf the First."
00:17:07.527,00:17:11.072,Pleasure to meet you. Dickie's made a fine catch.
00:17:11.405,00:17:13.741,-Uncanny! -I know Emily thinks so.
00:17:14.534,00:17:16.160,-I don't get it. -It's uncanny.
00:17:16.410,00:17:21.457,"Could you ever conceive of going to Italy, Tom, and, uh, bringing him back?"
00:17:22.458,00:17:23.334,What?
00:17:23.501,00:17:30.633,"I'd pay you if you would go to Italy, persuade my son to come home, I'd pay you $1,000."
00:17:35.429,00:17:41.602,"To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home… Got to be a little insane, doesn't he?"
00:17:46.691,00:17:47.775,"-Ciao, Silvana. -Ciao."
00:17:49.026,00:17:50.987,"-This is Tom. -Ciao, Tom."
00:17:51.612,00:17:53.614,"-Ciao. -Ciao, Greenleaf."
00:17:53.698,00:18:00.079,"-I'm never going back. -No, I think… Your mother, her illness, I think that's… It's got nothing to do with my mother."
00:18:01.747,00:18:05.167,She's had leukem-- This is what makes me boil about him.
00:18:05.251,00:18:08.129,He wants me back. He wants me back.
00:18:13.092,00:18:19.432,"Or call him, if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard."
00:18:31.485,00:18:33.696,"So, uh, did you speak to my father?"
00:18:34.030,00:18:36.616,"Oh, you were right. About the telephones."
00:18:42.079,00:18:46.125,Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
00:18:46.208,00:18:49.295,"Oh, back, I suppose, as slow as I can. Oh!"
00:18:54.675,00:18:57.678,Hey… You like jazz.
00:18:58.554,00:18:59.472,I love jazz.
00:19:02.516,00:19:03.809,This is the best.
00:19:04.393,00:19:06.687,"Baker, Rollins."
00:19:07.146,00:19:09.982,"Marge says she likes jazz, but she thinks Glenn Miller's jazz."
00:19:12.568,00:19:13.611,That's jazz.
00:19:14.654,00:19:17.073,Bird? Ask me the name of my sailboat.
00:19:17.323,00:19:19.158,I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat?
00:19:19.241,00:19:21.369,Look! Look! Bird!
00:19:24.372,00:19:26.999,Everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
00:19:27.083,00:19:28.793,He's not a man. He's a god.
00:19:29.168,00:19:39.095,"Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club… It's great. You're gonna love it."
00:20:55.629,00:20:57.339,-That'd be cool. -Bring him up.
00:21:01.802,00:21:03.387,Tom Ripley!
00:21:05.973,00:21:08.184,Come on! Get on up here!
00:21:14.648,00:21:16.692,I'll tell you when to join the chorus.
00:21:16.776,00:21:17.818,Come on.
00:21:27.411,00:21:28.746,Okay. Together!
00:22:14.166,00:22:22.800,He says he's going to haunt me until I agree to go back to New York with him.
00:22:29.598,00:22:30.641,Afternoon.
00:22:31.684,00:22:32.893,What time is it?
00:22:33.561,00:22:35.521,"-Oh, God. -Go back to New York with him."
00:22:36.730,00:22:39.400,-Here… -You always type your letters?
00:22:41.485,00:22:44.864,"-That should be two Ts. -I can't write, and I can't spell."
00:22:45.364,00:22:47.825,It's the privilege of a first-class education.
00:22:48.868,00:22:50.160,Your room's upstairs at the back.
00:22:50.244,00:22:52.872,I think Ermelinda made up the bed. Ermelinda!
00:22:56.000,00:22:58.294,-This is so good of you. -Don't say it again.
00:23:02.381,00:23:08.220,"Now that you're a double agent and we're gonna string my dad along, what if we were to buy a car with your expense money?"
00:23:08.512,00:23:10.514,-Okay. -Great.
00:23:10.764,00:23:12.474,"-Hello, Tom. -Hello."
00:23:12.558,00:23:14.602,"Marge, Marge, what do you think?"
00:23:15.477,00:23:17.313,Little Cinquecento with my dad's money?
00:23:17.605,00:23:20.316,"Oh, please, Dickie. You can't even drive a car."
00:23:24.695,00:23:26.614,Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
00:23:27.740,00:23:29.867,I absolutely agree with Marge.
00:23:30.242,00:23:31.327,Hmm.
00:23:31.869,00:23:33.787,Icebox. Icebox.
00:23:48.719,00:23:50.304,It'll just be for a little while.
00:23:50.804,00:23:52.806,He can be… He makes me laugh.
00:23:56.852,00:24:00.314,"-No, I like him. -Marge, you like everybody."
00:24:33.138,00:24:36.684,"Now you'll find out why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast, Tom."
00:24:36.767,00:24:39.103,It's not love. It's my coffee machine.
00:24:42.231,00:24:44.024,he feels like quite the grownup.
00:24:56.495,00:25:00.124,"I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off."
00:25:00.749,00:25:02.001,"Otherwise, I'd give it to you."
00:25:02.126,00:25:03.669,Isn't it great? I found it in Naples.
00:25:03.752,00:25:06.088,I had to bargain for it for about two weeks.
00:25:06.880,00:25:08.590,"I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge."
00:25:08.841,00:25:09.842,"Oh, it was."
00:25:11.218,00:25:15.014,"I have to get a birthday present for Frances, so perhaps you could help me."
00:25:15.180,00:25:16.807,-Who's Frances? -My fiancée.
00:25:21.437,00:25:23.188,-Who is she? -Your parents met her.
00:25:23.313,00:25:24.398,"Oh, God."
00:25:27.234,00:25:29.278,If only Dickie would settle down.
00:25:29.653,00:25:31.613,Doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild?
00:25:31.739,00:25:32.656,"Oh, God."
00:25:32.865,00:25:34.575,Never. Never.
00:25:34.658,00:25:38.662,"I swear on your ring, Marge, I'm never going back."
00:25:41.832,00:25:44.251,It's not pulling. I'm doing it wrong.
00:25:49.757,00:25:51.258,We'll make a sailor of you yet.
00:25:51.925,00:25:53.177,You're doing really well.
00:25:54.470,00:25:56.680,"-All right. Bar's open. -Yes, please."
00:25:56.930,00:26:00.601,"-Hey, can we sail to Venice? -Sure. I love Venice."
00:26:02.352,00:26:05.564,See Venice and die. Isn't that right? Or is it Rome?
00:26:06.231,00:26:08.567,-Is it Rome? -I have to see Venice.
00:26:08.817,00:26:12.446,"You do something and die, don't you? Okay. Venice is on the list."
00:26:12.738,00:26:13.614,And Rome.
00:26:15.199,00:26:16.366,Do you ski?
00:26:19.870,00:26:22.039,"Ah, no, no. Don't tell me."
00:26:22.289,00:26:25.667,You're a lost cause. That's the next thing to deal with.
00:26:25.793,00:26:28.378,"Christmas, we're planning a skiing trip to Cortina."
00:26:28.670,00:26:30.464,Excellent skiing. Excellent.
00:26:34.009,00:26:37.054,"-We'll have to teach him that, too. -Thank you."
00:26:43.852,00:26:45.729,It's a good thing we're not getting married soon.
00:26:45.813,00:26:47.731,We'd have to invite Tom on our honeymoon.
00:26:54.530,00:26:56.448,So I fled to Paris to work on my book.
00:26:57.074,00:27:01.161,And I was always going to this cafe in Montmartre with Jean-Jacques.
00:27:01.829,00:27:05.249,And Dickie would play My Funny Valentine.
00:27:06.667,00:27:10.170,It was only later that I found out he only knows about six songs.
00:27:11.004,00:27:13.006,"Anyway, I looked forward to seeing him, I suppose."
00:27:39.741,00:27:42.244,"Hey, hey, Signor Greenleaf!"
00:27:43.287,00:27:46.874,"If you're not at my place by seven o'clock, Tom and I are running off together."
00:28:00.304,00:28:02.139,Ho! Hold on. Hold on.
00:29:13.293,00:29:17.089,"I could fuck this icebox, I love it so much."
00:29:19.675,00:29:22.719,"So, what did you actually do in New York?"
00:29:23.345,00:29:25.806,Played piano in a few places. I told you.
00:29:25.889,00:29:28.934,"Well, that's one job. You told me a lot of jobs."
00:29:29.059,00:29:30.978,Few places. That's a few jobs.
00:29:31.228,00:29:33.105,The mysterious Mr. Ripley.
00:29:33.730,00:29:36.024,Marge and I spent hours speculating.
00:29:37.150,00:29:39.403,"Anyway, I don't even want to think about New York."
00:29:40.487,00:29:42.030,-Are you ready? -Mm.
00:29:46.910,00:29:48.537,Copy out from here.
00:29:57.504,00:30:00.549,Ermelinda says you wash out the same shirt every night. Is that true?
00:30:00.966,00:30:02.509,No. I have more than one shirt.
00:30:03.051,00:30:04.386,She can do that for you.
00:30:04.970,00:30:07.014,"Anyway, just wear some of my stuff."
00:30:07.514,00:30:10.767,Wear anything you want. Most of it's ancient.
00:30:12.394,00:30:13.645,Now your signature.
00:30:17.316,00:30:19.901,Not Dickie! Your signature.
00:30:31.288,00:30:33.165,"Without the glasses, you're not even ugly."
00:30:36.335,00:30:38.211,I don't need them because I never read.
00:30:44.843,00:30:48.263,-Now Superman. -Superman.
00:30:51.141,00:30:52.267,Hmm.
00:30:52.893,00:30:55.228,-Okay. -I know.
00:31:00.901,00:31:03.445,That's pain. That's secret pain.
00:31:03.820,00:31:06.531,"Well, it must be a very deep secret, 'cause I don't know about it."
00:31:06.615,00:31:09.493,Hmm. There's nothing more naked than your handwriting.
00:31:09.951,00:31:11.995,And see how nothing's quite touching the line?
00:31:12.788,00:31:14.081,That's vanity.
00:31:14.539,00:31:16.124,"Well, we certainly know that's true."
00:31:28.095,00:31:29.721,"No brothers, no sisters."
00:31:32.182,00:31:33.183,Me neither.
00:31:34.976,00:31:36.061,Nor does Marge.
00:31:38.772,00:31:40.482,All only children.
00:31:47.864,00:31:49.241,What does that mean?
00:31:51.743,00:31:53.787,Means we've never shared a bath.
00:31:58.375,00:32:00.252,And I'm cold. Can I get in?
00:32:07.509,00:32:08.385,No.
00:32:12.347,00:32:13.890,I didn't mean with you in it.
00:32:22.190,00:32:25.277,Get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
00:32:47.757,00:32:49.801,It is me. It's an old picture.
00:32:50.343,00:32:51.887,Every time!
00:32:52.095,00:32:55.015,Is it you? Doesn't look like you. God!
00:32:55.098,00:32:57.601,Letters. Greenleaf and for Ripley.
00:32:57.726,00:32:58.847,Ooh. Fran.
00:32:59.227,00:33:01.771,I miss you. When are you coming home?
00:33:01.897,00:33:04.316,Stop telling me what an incredible time you're having.
00:33:04.524,00:33:06.526,-How much you love Dickie… -Whoo!
00:33:06.735,00:33:08.737,And Marge and Mongibello.
00:33:09.905,00:33:11.764,"And this one, I think, is from your father."
00:33:16.620,00:33:19.498,-Let me see it. What does he say? -He's getting impatient.
00:33:21.124,00:33:24.169,He wants me to reassure him that you're gonna be home by Thanksgiving.
00:33:25.545,00:33:28.089,You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
00:33:28.215,00:33:30.175,You must be sick of wearing the same clothes.
00:33:30.300,00:33:33.345,I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
00:33:33.678,00:33:35.522,I love how responsible you are.
00:33:36.765,00:33:39.197,My dad should make you chief accountant or something.
00:33:40.018,00:33:42.622,"Or when I take over, which is never, I will."
00:33:42.812,00:33:45.857,"Okay. When you take over, which is never, I'll accept."
00:33:45.982,00:33:47.484,Let me buy you a jacket.
00:33:47.567,00:33:50.237,"When we get to Rome, there's a great place, Battistoni."
00:34:12.425,00:34:13.552,Nice sweater.
00:34:13.677,00:34:15.345,Where do we get a carrozza for the Forum?
00:34:15.428,00:34:17.639,-Can we just hire any of them? -Relax.
00:34:20.433,00:34:22.727,It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
00:34:22.852,00:34:24.688,The most important question is where to eat.
00:34:25.146,00:34:26.731,I hope Freddie made a reservation.
00:34:27.607,00:34:28.608,Freddie?
00:34:29.442,00:34:30.569,Freddie.
00:34:31.570,00:34:32.737,Freddie Miles.
00:34:33.154,00:34:35.198,Freddie's organizing the Cortina skiing trip.
00:34:35.532,00:34:36.575,Oh.
00:34:37.534,00:34:38.910,"Oh, here he is."
00:34:43.206,00:34:44.124,Frederico!
00:34:44.332,00:34:45.333,Come stai?
00:34:45.500,00:34:46.668,Bene!
00:34:51.423,00:34:54.092,"Oh, God, don't you want to fuck every woman you see just once?"
00:34:54.759,00:34:57.762,-Only once? -Absolutely. Once. Ciao.
00:34:57.846,00:34:59.598,"-Tom Ripley, Freddie Miles. -Tom."
00:35:00.473,00:35:03.018,"I mean, hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying."
00:35:07.689,00:35:10.150,-Mm. -So… Mangiare.
00:35:10.483,00:35:12.819,Si. I got us a table outside at Fabrizio's. Tommy.
00:35:33.632,00:35:36.760,"Look, Tom, we got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's."
00:35:36.843,00:35:42.432,"The best thing is, if you want to be a tourist, grab a cab now and I'll meet you at the railway station."
00:35:42.932,00:35:44.100,What club?
00:35:46.561,00:35:49.522,Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd.
00:35:51.358,00:35:53.902,"Come if you want, but I thought you wanted to go sightseeing."
00:35:53.985,00:35:56.488,"I do, and then maybe get the jacket and what have you."
00:35:56.668,00:35:58.657,Dick! You gotta hear this.
00:36:00.533,00:36:02.786,"Listen, just take one of mine when we get back."
00:36:03.244,00:36:04.371,Don't worry about it.
00:36:20.011,00:36:22.347,"Ciao. Have fun, okay?"
00:36:23.973,00:36:36.945,"Oh, uh… You said to make sure you didn't miss the train."
00:36:43.076,00:36:44.244,"See ya, Tommy."
00:38:01.780,00:38:04.908,Oh. I was just amusing myself.
00:38:06.284,00:38:07.202,Sorry.
00:38:08.036,00:38:09.746,I wish you'd get out of my clothes.
00:38:10.663,00:38:12.290,"Do you have my shoes on, too?"
00:38:12.415,00:38:20.215,"You said I could pick out a jacket, so… Could you get undressed in your own room?"
00:38:23.843,00:38:25.261,Thought you missed the train.
00:38:28.473,00:38:30.934,-Is Freddie here? -He's downstairs.
00:38:31.935,00:38:33.394,I was just fooling around.
00:38:34.479,00:38:35.647,Don't say anything.
00:38:39.901,00:38:40.902,Sorry.
00:38:54.916,00:38:57.168,"You know, I want this job of yours, Tommy."
00:38:57.293,00:39:14.269,"I was just saying, you live in Italy, you stay at Dickie's house, you eat Dickie's food, you wear his clothes, Uh, if you get bored, you let me know, 'cause I'll do it."
00:39:26.447,00:39:27.574,I'm fine.
00:39:38.710,00:39:39.878,Are you okay?
00:39:41.921,00:39:42.922,Sure.
00:39:45.842,00:39:55.518,"Well… The thing with Dickie… It's like the sun shines on you, and it's glorious."
00:39:57.437,00:40:00.857,"And then he forgets you and it's very, very cold."
00:40:01.691,00:40:02.817,So I'm learning.
00:40:03.735,00:40:06.779,"When you have his attention, you feel like you're the only person in the world."
00:40:06.863,00:40:08.406,That's why everybody loves him.
00:40:09.574,00:40:17.916,"It's always the same. Whenever someone new comes into his life… Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley… He's wonderful. Have you met him?"
00:40:20.877,00:40:21.961,Especially you.
00:40:37.936,00:40:40.897,Come get him! Come get him!
00:40:41.314,00:40:45.318,"Tell me, why is it that when men play, they always play at killing each other?"
00:40:50.949,00:40:53.076,"I'm sorry about Cortina, by the way."
00:40:53.910,00:40:55.161,What about Cortina?
00:40:57.205,00:41:00.583,Didn't… Didn't… Didn't Dick say?
00:41:02.794,00:41:06.381,"He spoke to Freddie, and… And apparently, it's not going to work out."
00:41:10.969,00:41:25.566,and it affects where you stay… At least stick around for the festival of the Madonna.
00:41:31.781,00:41:33.116,Why don't you come back with me?
00:41:33.408,00:41:35.451,A lot of ladies. Ooh.
00:41:41.457,00:41:43.084,"-Oh, God. -You want to take over?"
00:41:43.167,00:41:45.294,"Mm. Yeah, sure."
00:41:45.378,00:41:47.755,Just point her at Capri. Avoid the rocks.
00:41:48.548,00:41:49.757,Where you going?
00:41:50.299,00:41:52.427,Mm… Marge maintenance.
00:41:54.012,00:41:55.179,Aye-aye.
00:42:38.097,00:42:39.390,How's the peeping?
00:42:41.726,00:42:45.104,"Tommy, how's the peeping?"
00:42:47.190,00:42:48.858,"Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy."
00:44:07.019,00:44:08.229,Silvana!
00:44:41.721,00:44:43.264,Is someone getting an ambulance?
00:45:20.218,00:45:22.970,"What's the fight about? That's her fiancé, isn't it?"
00:45:23.221,00:45:26.057,I don't know. Why are you asking me?
00:45:28.226,00:45:31.145,How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
00:45:31.771,00:45:37.652,"She was already dead, darling, wasn't she? So I suppose… I don't know why people say this country is civilized."
00:45:39.111,00:45:41.239,-Dickie! -It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
00:45:43.658,00:45:45.201,I'll go see what's the matter.
00:45:46.494,00:45:47.578,I'll go.
00:46:09.517,00:46:11.185,"I know about Silvana, Dickie."
00:46:14.605,00:46:16.190,I know about you and Silvana.
00:46:17.942,00:46:19.193,What about us?
00:46:33.791,00:46:36.168,-Like what? -Forget it.
00:46:38.713,00:46:40.756,She was pregnant. Did you know that?
00:46:45.636,00:46:47.096,Silvana was pregnant.
00:46:50.182,00:46:52.435,Do you know what that means in a place like this?
00:46:52.768,00:46:54.061,I'm prepared to take the blame.
00:46:56.022,00:46:57.273,What are you talking about?
00:46:57.606,00:46:59.025,You've been so good to me.
00:46:59.692,00:47:01.402,You're the brother I never had.
00:47:01.610,00:47:03.279,I'm the brother you never had.
00:47:04.822,00:47:06.782,"I would do anything for you, Dickie."
00:47:09.618,00:47:11.078,She came to me for help.
00:47:11.912,00:47:13.205,She needed money.
00:47:17.001,00:47:18.336,I didn't help her.
00:47:19.462,00:47:20.588,I didn't help her.
00:47:22.256,00:47:25.426,"Now she's drowned herself, and it's my fault."
00:47:33.392,00:47:34.852,I'm not going to say anything.
00:47:35.102,00:47:37.980,"To Marge, to the police, or anybody."
00:47:39.231,00:47:41.067,"It's a secret between us, Dickie."
00:47:43.486,00:47:44.779,And I'll keep it.
00:47:51.786,00:48:02.797,"than before you went… Blah, blah, blah, um… I hope that the trip has afforded you some pleasure, despite the failure of its main objective."
00:48:03.214,00:48:07.176,You no longer should consider yourself obligated to us in any way.
00:48:08.052,00:48:09.345,Can't blame him.
00:48:09.762,00:48:11.806,"You could hardly expect this to go on forever, Tom."
00:48:11.931,00:48:13.349,"Well, you can write again."
00:48:14.809,00:48:17.103,-Especially now we're brothers. -I can't.
00:48:17.395,00:48:19.230,"How can I, in all decency?"
00:48:22.733,00:48:25.277,"We've had a great run though, haven't we?"
00:48:26.779,00:48:28.155,"Well, we'll still go to Venice."
00:48:28.239,00:48:30.074,We could stick to that plan.
00:48:30.908,00:48:32.326,"I don't think so, Tom."
00:48:32.868,00:48:34.745,"You can't pay your own way, can you?"
00:48:35.746,00:48:37.873,It's time we all moved on.
00:48:39.458,00:48:46.215,"I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now, with everything… I really want to move to the north."
00:48:46.715,00:48:49.051,I need to check out San Remo next week.
00:48:49.135,00:48:50.886,Find somewhere new to keep the boat.
00:48:51.971,00:48:54.390,"It would be great, though, if you came with me to San Remo."
00:48:54.765,00:48:57.977,There's a great jazz festival. We could say goodbye in style.
00:48:58.644,00:48:59.895,What do you think?
00:49:00.855,00:49:02.231,Our last trip!
00:49:09.155,00:49:10.281,Sure.
00:50:05.836,00:50:07.671,Why do you do that thing with your neck?
00:50:11.967,00:50:14.845,"On trains, you always do that thing."
00:50:30.986,00:50:31.946,Spooky.
00:50:53.050,00:50:54.176,Oh!
00:50:55.177,00:50:57.596,Didn't I tell you San Remo was crazy?
00:50:59.390,00:51:01.850,This is more like it! Come on!
00:51:12.111,00:51:13.153,Grazie.
00:51:14.154,00:51:17.408,"To Mongibello, and the happiest days of my life."
00:51:17.533,00:51:19.451,To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
00:51:20.411,00:51:22.371,I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
00:51:22.871,00:51:24.957,"Did I know you at Princeton, Tom?"
00:51:25.457,00:51:26.834,"I don't think I did, did I?"
00:51:28.002,00:51:31.171,-Why are you asking all of a sudden? -No reason.
00:51:31.338,00:51:33.048,"Because you're leaving, I guess."
00:51:33.382,00:51:34.717,I don't think you were there.
00:51:36.427,00:51:37.469,Why?
00:51:37.928,00:51:39.555,I mean it as a compliment.
00:51:39.722,00:51:41.265,You've got such great taste.
00:51:41.640,00:51:45.561,Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste.
00:51:45.686,00:51:49.773,"I used to say, The cream of America, rich and thick."
00:51:50.816,00:51:52.651,Freddie's the perfect example.
00:51:53.485,00:51:55.362,Then I'll take it as a compliment.
00:51:55.529,00:51:57.573,I knew it! I knew it.
00:51:57.656,00:51:59.116,Marge and I had a bet.
00:52:08.876,00:52:10.377,Do you even like jazz?
00:52:13.130,00:52:14.548,I've gotten to like it.
00:52:14.673,00:52:15.674,"Oh, yes!"
00:52:17.468,00:52:19.970,I've gotten to like everything about the way you live.
00:52:20.638,00:52:22.139,It's one big love affair.
00:52:24.892,00:52:29.146,If you knew my life back home in New York… I'm thinkin' of givin' up the sax.
00:52:29.605,00:52:31.231,What do you think about the drums?
00:52:31.523,00:52:33.776,-What? -So cool.
00:52:35.069,00:52:37.488,"I'm gonna rent a boat tomorrow, take a look around."
00:52:41.575,00:52:45.954,Took a boat out… Around the bay.
00:52:46.538,00:52:50.125,"First thing I liked, I got it."
00:52:59.301,00:53:01.679,"No, wait a minute! It's gonna tip! Oh, God, no!"
00:53:01.762,00:53:03.514,Stop! Stop it! It's not funny! It's not funny.
00:53:03.597,00:53:04.932,It's not funny. Stop it!
00:53:08.477,00:53:10.688,"Oh, I love it here!"
00:53:10.771,00:53:12.940,I love it here! I'm gonna move here!
00:53:13.440,00:53:14.525,Beautiful.
00:53:20.197,00:53:21.824,I want to tell you my plan.
00:53:22.116,00:53:29.248,"God… Well, I thought I'd come back in the new year under my own steam."
00:53:30.040,00:53:32.000,-Really? To Italy? -Of course.
00:53:32.876,00:53:37.423,"And I figured, now, just for argument's sake, say I got a place."
00:53:38.382,00:53:47.933,"Or say we split the rent on a house, I could get a job, or, better still, if I got a place in Rome, and then when we're there, we could be there, then when we're here, we could be here."
00:53:48.058,00:53:51.895,"-Uh, I don't think so. -See, particularly with the Marge problem."
00:53:53.605,00:53:54.565,You just blame me.
00:53:55.733,00:53:57.484,Marge and I are getting married.
00:53:59.361,00:54:00.237,How?
00:54:01.238,00:54:02.239,How?
00:54:02.322,00:54:04.366,"Yesterday, you were ogling girls on the terrace."
00:54:04.533,00:54:06.285,"Today, you're getting married? That's absurd."
00:54:08.537,00:54:09.747,I love Marge.
00:54:10.664,00:54:12.541,You love me. You're not marrying me.
00:54:12.624,00:54:15.210,"-Tom, I don't love you. -No, I don't mean that as a threat."
00:54:15.335,00:54:18.005,"To be honest, I'm… I'm a little relieved you're going."
00:54:18.547,00:54:20.883,I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
00:54:26.138,00:54:28.432,-What? -You can be a leech!
00:54:29.183,00:54:30.309,You know that!
00:54:34.897,00:54:36.064,It's boring.
00:54:39.026,00:54:41.445,You can be quite boring.
00:54:53.832,00:54:58.378,"The funny thing is, I'm not pretending to be somebody else, and you are."
00:54:59.046,00:55:04.176,-Boring. -I've been absolutely honest with you… -about my feelings. -Boring.
00:55:04.885,00:55:08.555,"But you… First of all, I know there's something."
00:55:08.764,00:55:11.475,"That evening, when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious."
00:55:11.558,00:55:12.392,What evening?
00:55:12.559,00:55:14.978,"Oh, sure. No, no. It's too dangerous for you to take on."
00:55:15.395,00:55:17.105,"Oh, no, no. What? We're brothers."
00:55:17.606,00:55:18.607,Hey!
00:55:19.316,00:55:29.076,"And then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat, while we all have to listen… And you follow your cock around like a… And now you're getting married."
00:55:29.743,00:55:31.453,"No, I'm bewildered. Forgive me."
00:55:31.578,00:55:33.956,You're lying to Marge and then you're getting married to her.
00:55:34.039,00:55:35.541,You're knocking up Silvana.
00:55:35.916,00:55:39.044,You're ruining everybody… You wanna play the sax. You wanna play the drums.
00:55:39.127,00:55:40.796,"Which is it, Dickie? What do you actually play?"
00:55:42.881,00:55:44.007,Who are you? Huh?
00:55:44.716,00:55:46.552,Some third-class mooch? Who are you?
00:55:46.760,00:55:48.595,Who are you to say anything to me?
00:55:48.720,00:55:51.181,-Stop! -Who are you to tell me anything?
00:55:51.306,00:55:54.518,"Actually, I really, really do not want to be on this boat with you."
00:55:54.726,00:55:56.895,-I can't move without you moving. -Shut up.
00:55:57.020,00:55:58.313,-Shut up. -It gives me the creeps.
00:55:58.397,00:56:01.191,-You give me the creeps. -You shut up!
00:56:01.316,00:56:04.027,"I can't move without Dickie, Dickie, Dickie, like a little girl all the time."
00:56:04.111,00:56:05.070,Shut up!
00:56:08.156,00:56:09.783,"Oh, God, Dickie."
00:56:15.789,00:56:16.957,"Okay, okay."
00:56:18.292,00:56:40.022,"We have to get you-- Okay… Stop! Stop! Please, Dickie! Please!"
00:56:46.486,00:56:47.779,"-Dickie, let-- -Kill you!"
00:56:50.991,00:56:52.242,-Give me that! -No!
00:59:04.499,00:59:07.294,"-Hi. Can I have my key, please? -Of course."
00:59:08.754,00:59:12.632,"You must be very cold. Uh, Signor Greenleaf, yes?"
00:59:12.758,01:00:31.920,No. I'm… You startled me!
01:00:32.671,01:00:34.131,-Sorry. -You're back!
01:00:34.464,01:00:35.382,How are you?
01:00:35.674,01:00:37.926,-Your book going well? -Yes.
01:00:38.051,01:00:40.303,"I'm on a good streak, thank you."
01:00:40.512,01:00:43.348,I was just looking at you.
01:00:46.518,01:00:47.686,Where's Dickie?
01:00:50.939,01:00:54.276,I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
01:00:54.568,01:00:55.610,Rome?
01:00:55.986,01:00:57.863,Ah. Did he say why?
01:00:58.155,01:01:00.949,I don't understand Dickie. Your guess is as good as mine.
01:01:01.783,01:01:02.951,"Well, what does that mean?"
01:01:03.118,01:01:07.539,"Oh, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not."
01:01:09.791,01:01:13.837,"One day, we're one family, then the next day he wants to be alone."
01:01:14.713,01:01:15.714,You tell me.
01:01:15.922,01:01:18.592,Is that what he said? He wants to be alone?
01:01:19.426,01:01:22.721,He was thinking of you. He asked me to deliver this.
01:01:30.520,01:01:33.440,"-But why it couldn't have waited, I… -Errand number one."
01:01:33.899,01:01:35.567,Deliver Marge's perfume.
01:01:36.359,01:01:41.573,"Errand number two, um… Pack some clothes and his precious saxophone."
01:01:43.909,01:01:45.619,"Well, how long is he staying for?"
01:01:45.869,01:01:46.953,Search me.
01:01:47.662,01:01:49.164,I guess we're abandoned.
01:02:32.165,01:02:35.001,There was a letter from Dickie in with my perfume.
01:02:37.212,01:02:39.881,You realize it's more than just a few days.
01:02:45.512,01:03:01.611,"The thing is, the night before he left, we… We talked about moving together… Somewhere north, and I suppose I… …put some pressure on him about getting married."
01:03:04.030,01:03:25.343,"I just… There's a side to him when our heads are on the pillow, I know no one else sees, that's so tender."
01:03:27.721,01:03:30.890,I just think I should come with you to Rome and confront him.
01:03:37.355,01:03:39.107,He hates being confronted.
01:03:42.110,01:03:43.194,I think you're right.
01:03:53.330,01:03:55.206,Grazie. Checking in.
01:04:06.718,01:04:09.804,-Signor Ripley? -It's me.
01:04:15.727,01:04:17.771,Of course. Welcome back.
01:04:18.313,01:04:19.397,Thank you.
01:04:47.801,01:04:49.677,-Yes. Grazie. -Subito.
01:05:04.818,01:05:05.819,Signor Ripley's not there.
01:05:05.902,01:05:07.904,"-He's not there? -No, signor."
01:05:08.154,01:05:09.823,"Well, I would like to leave a message."
01:05:09.948,01:05:11.282,He's not there?
01:05:15.412,01:05:18.790,-Dinner tonight… -Dinner tonight… -Sounds fine. -Sounds fine.
01:05:21.209,01:05:22.293,Ripley.
01:05:29.717,01:05:31.052,At the Grand.
01:05:35.348,01:05:37.225,I don't know the word in Italian.
01:05:37.350,01:05:39.352,"Embossed. Of course, Signor Greenleaf."
01:05:39.436,01:05:40.437,Thank you.
01:05:45.316,01:05:55.743,"Dickie! Uh, it's me… -Ciao! -Ciao. Come in. come in."
01:06:01.124,01:06:02.500,To Cortina.
01:06:03.334,01:06:05.295,-With Freddie Miles. -How did you know that?
01:06:05.420,01:06:09.090,Oh! Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
01:06:12.051,01:06:13.553,Is Freddie in Rome?
01:06:14.304,01:06:15.597,-Now? -Yeah.
01:06:15.889,01:06:17.474,"Oh, I don't think so."
01:06:18.683,01:06:22.312,"But I… But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted."
01:06:23.271,01:06:28.818,And… I know about you and Marge in Mongi.
01:06:29.277,01:06:32.071,What an unreliable rat you are.
01:06:32.697,01:06:34.824,"Well, uh, Freddie said you were a rat."
01:06:35.033,01:06:40.538,"And I thought to myself, Ah, now I know why he travels under 'R'."
01:06:40.705,01:06:42.832,"I've left Marge, Meredith."
01:06:42.999,01:06:44.125,And Mongi.
01:06:45.335,01:06:48.379,"-So, the rat's here in Rome. -Oh, I'm sorry."
01:06:48.505,01:06:51.966,"-Oh, don't be sorry, no. -I would not have made a joke… I've never been happier."
01:06:52.050,01:06:54.719,I… I feel like I've been handed a new life.
01:06:55.386,01:07:02.393,"The truth is that if you've had money your entire life, either you despise it, which we do, agreed?"
01:07:02.727,01:07:08.525,You're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
01:07:08.691,01:07:09.817,I know.
01:07:11.986,01:07:13.988,I've never admitted that to anyone.
01:07:29.837,01:07:33.508,"Oh, I love Italian money. So darling. Doesn't make you feel guilty."
01:07:35.134,01:07:36.177,Grazie.
01:07:36.427,01:07:37.387,Thank you.
01:07:46.604,01:07:50.316,I don't want too many large bills. No one will change them.
01:07:50.608,01:07:52.485,"Tutto bene, Signor Greenleaf."
01:08:08.459,01:08:11.629,"-I really like this, too. -I think I'm having that, too."
01:08:36.946,01:08:40.783,"I know you're a jazz fiend, but do you absolutely hate the opera?"
01:08:44.329,01:08:50.627,I've… I've… been trying to give my tickets away.
01:08:51.169,01:08:58.092,"It's tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be dragged… You could drag me."
01:10:48.619,01:10:51.289,Feodor Chaliapin. He's an old Russian baritone.
01:10:51.456,01:10:53.583,Thank you so much for inviting me tonight.
01:10:54.917,01:10:56.169,Can you bear it?
01:10:56.586,01:10:58.337,We hear you are a friend of Freddie's.
01:10:58.671,01:11:01.549,He has I hate opera tattooed on his chest.
01:11:06.554,01:11:08.556,I'm sure we've met before.
01:11:08.765,01:11:11.809,"I was sure we'd met before. Weren't you, Ted?"
01:11:11.934,01:11:14.020,Dick is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
01:11:14.103,01:11:16.063,"-I know. -Yes, I think we have."
01:11:16.856,01:11:20.651,"One minute you people are children, and the next you're getting tattooed."
01:11:22.820,01:11:24.197,-Cheers. -Cheers.
01:11:27.533,01:11:28.659,Cheers.
01:11:33.664,01:11:35.333,-Excuse me. -Prego.
01:11:36.501,01:11:38.169,Oh! Excuse me.
01:11:38.753,01:11:39.629,Hello.
01:11:39.754,01:11:40.838,Hello.
01:11:42.840,01:11:44.258,-Tom! -Marge!
01:11:44.842,01:11:47.470,How are you? What are you doing in Rome?
01:11:47.553,01:11:49.096,Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
01:11:49.222,01:11:51.224,"No. Um, no."
01:11:51.516,01:11:52.850,"Um, hello."
01:11:52.934,01:11:54.310,"Um, I'm Tom Ripley."
01:11:54.435,01:11:57.396,Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard all about you from Marge and Dickie.
01:11:57.480,01:11:59.398,-Ditto. -No… no glasses.
01:12:00.107,01:12:02.568,"So, where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?"
01:12:02.777,01:12:03.903,Is he really not here?
01:12:05.029,01:12:08.574,"Well, Marge, you know Dickie has I hate opera tattooed on his chest."
01:12:08.825,01:12:10.326,I thought you were going to Venice.
01:12:10.451,01:12:11.786,"Yes, what happened with that?"
01:12:11.911,01:12:13.371,I heard you were desperate to come.
01:12:13.704,01:12:15.873,I was rather looking forward to rowing you around.
01:12:17.750,01:12:19.669,"Um, I really am."
01:12:19.752,01:12:22.672,"I've been traveling, and I just can't seem to get that far north."
01:12:23.089,01:12:24.882,"Well, you should hurry, before we sink."
01:12:25.424,01:12:28.052,"Uh, look, let me give you a telephone number."
01:12:28.719,01:12:32.223,"There. Oh, look, there's Meredith. Meredith."
01:12:32.557,01:12:34.934,"What's her name, Marge? The textile people."
01:12:35.059,01:12:37.895,"Um, come on. Some of us spent Christmas at her house."
01:12:38.020,01:12:39.438,I don't… I don't know her.
01:12:42.358,01:12:43.609,He hasn't called.
01:12:44.193,01:12:45.570,-Oh. -He's hardly written.
01:12:45.778,01:12:48.030,"Just these cryptic notes, you know?"
01:12:48.114,01:12:49.574,You don't just dump people.
01:12:52.034,01:12:53.452,or are you with people?
01:12:53.703,01:12:55.121,"Oh, I can't later."
01:12:55.204,01:12:56.789,"Well, how about tomorrow?"
01:12:56.914,01:12:58.457,"Yes, uh, maybe in the morning?"
01:12:58.749,01:13:02.211,Do you know Cafe Dinelli at the Piazza di Spagna?
01:13:02.336,01:13:04.297,I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
01:13:04.755,01:13:05.923,Ten thirty?
01:13:06.549,01:13:08.092,-We'll be there. -Okay.
01:13:08.384,01:13:10.011,"So I'll see you in the morning, Marge?"
01:13:10.469,01:13:11.637,Ten thirty?
01:13:12.179,01:13:13.514,Very nice to meet you.
01:13:18.978,01:13:20.021,Come on.
01:13:21.606,01:13:23.566,-Come on. Let's go back in. -Yes.
01:13:36.245,01:13:38.205,"Oh, I thought you were enjoying yourself."
01:13:38.289,01:13:39.999,Let's take a carrozza and look at the moon.
01:13:40.082,01:13:42.585,Are you crazy? It's freezing out there.
01:13:42.668,01:13:45.129,Come on. I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
01:13:53.679,01:13:54.847,Don't worry.
01:13:56.390,01:13:58.225,You're such a pal to understand.
01:14:00.353,01:14:04.440,"It's like Marge is here right now. I look at you, -and I see her face. -Mm."
01:14:05.149,01:14:12.782,"And I can't, no matter what I'm feeling towards you… No, I… I absolutely… understand."
01:14:13.324,01:14:14.742,"Otherwise, you'd be fighting me off."
01:14:57.702,01:14:59.036,But will you meet me tomorrow?
01:15:00.246,01:15:03.374,"Just to say good-bye properly, you know."
01:15:03.833,01:15:06.043,"In the daylight, so it's not just this."
01:15:06.419,01:15:09.088,"Of course, Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you."
01:15:09.839,01:15:13.092,You should always save pain for daylight.
01:15:14.301,01:15:16.721,Why don't we have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's?
01:15:17.888,01:15:19.890,"Uh, by the Spanish Steps."
01:15:20.266,01:15:21.892,Exactly. Ten thirty?
01:15:24.645,01:15:25.730,Ten-fifteen.
01:15:26.230,01:15:28.399,-Okay. -Okay.
01:16:23.412,01:16:24.580,Hello.
01:16:24.830,01:16:26.248,It's Meredith Logue.
01:16:32.671,01:16:34.673,This is Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.
01:16:35.216,01:16:36.509,How do you do?
01:16:41.639,01:16:46.060,"I won't, actually. I think there's… Did we see you at the opera last night?"
01:16:46.143,01:16:48.437,"Uh, are you waiting for Dickie?"
01:16:52.274,01:16:53.943,Do you… Do you know Dickie?
01:16:54.443,01:16:57.696,"You were at the opera. Oh, that explains… Yes, I was there."
01:16:57.780,01:16:59.782,I was there with Dickie.
01:17:08.833,01:17:14.880,"Marge, I don't know you, so I've got no right to… Dickie loves you."
01:17:15.297,01:17:19.593,"He's… Well, I think you'll find he's on his way home to you."
01:17:22.263,01:17:24.140,"Well, how would you know that?"
01:17:25.391,01:17:27.935,He told me everything.
01:17:28.519,01:17:35.234,"No, I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so, uh… I'm gonna go now, I think."
01:17:37.862,01:17:39.822,"God, unless he meant us to meet."
01:17:40.322,01:17:42.074,"That'd be a little cruel, wouldn't it?"
01:17:44.410,01:17:46.412,-Tom Ripley. -Do you know Tom Ripley?
01:17:46.954,01:17:52.209,"No, no. I've heard about him, of course, but I didn't… meet him, no."
01:18:00.759,01:18:02.511,Hope I didn't complicate matters.
01:18:03.304,01:18:07.266,"God, nothing, nothing… untoward happened."
01:18:08.726,01:18:14.899,"No, there is nothing to prevent you from welcoming him back, from marrying him."
01:18:19.361,01:18:22.156,Good-bye. I'm happy to put a face to a name.
01:18:22.406,01:18:24.783,"Good-bye, Peter. Please, don't get up."
01:18:46.889,01:18:48.390,Do you think he's coming back or what?
01:18:53.479,01:18:55.814,Never one stamp when they can make you line up for three.
01:18:56.065,01:18:57.775,-Have you been waiting long? -Not at all.
01:18:58.108,01:18:59.401,"-Morning, Tom. -Hi."
01:19:00.152,01:19:02.905,Sorry. You okay? You look like you've seen a ghost.
01:19:03.030,01:19:04.573,Dickie was at the opera last night.
01:19:05.491,01:19:06.784,I don't believe that.
01:19:09.954,01:19:13.290,"Well, he was there with someone, you know, so I suppose she must have dragged him."
01:19:14.458,01:19:15.668,It's not fair.
01:19:16.669,01:19:18.587,I think I'm going back to Mongi.
01:19:18.671,01:19:21.006,I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going home.
01:19:21.131,01:19:26.011,"Really? Well, that's just swell. Well, I… No, you know, you're way ahead of me. Great."
01:19:26.095,01:19:28.389,"You know, that was rather moving when Meredith… I'm sorry."
01:19:28.514,01:19:31.058,Meredith is the American girl I saw at the opera last night.
01:19:31.141,01:19:32.726,She's been seeing something of Dickie.
01:19:33.519,01:19:34.853,"Oh, my God."
01:19:35.354,01:19:40.109,"But the point is, Dickie, and we all know this, Dickie loves Marge."
01:19:41.026,01:19:42.236,And he misses her.
01:19:42.736,01:19:47.324,"I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but whenever Dickie does something, I feel guilty."
01:19:49.076,01:19:50.411,As if that makes sense.
01:21:22.669,01:21:24.213,It's Freddie. Let me in.
01:21:34.390,01:21:35.933,"Hello, Freddie. It's Tom."
01:21:38.018,01:21:41.063,Um… Where's Dickie?
01:21:42.022,01:21:43.023,How are you?
01:21:43.232,01:21:44.691,"I'm good. Uh, yes, thank you."
01:21:44.858,01:21:46.402,He's gone. He went to dinner.
01:21:46.652,01:21:49.071,He's at Otello's. Do you know Otello's?
01:21:49.154,01:21:53.575,"No, no, no… I don't think he's at dinner at 6:30 p.m."
01:21:53.951,01:21:57.121,"If you said he was still at lunch, maybe I'd believe you."
01:21:59.289,01:22:00.457,Incredible.
01:22:01.166,01:22:04.086,"I mean, the guy just, you know, disappeared off the face of the earth."
01:22:07.047,01:22:08.215,I guess.
01:22:13.345,01:22:15.973,the landlady said he was here right now.
01:22:17.099,01:22:18.350,Search the place.
01:22:19.393,01:22:23.230,I… I just don't… I don't know why you'd imagine that Dickie would hide from you.
01:22:23.313,01:22:24.731,Because he's been hiding from me.
01:22:27.025,01:22:28.444,What happened at Christmas?
01:22:32.656,01:22:38.745,"I didn't get a cable or a call or a little note or a… Frankly, a fart."
01:22:41.081,01:22:43.167,"Well, he's been very involved with his music."
01:22:43.333,01:22:52.342,"Um, I think his theory is that you have to go into a cocoon, uh, before you can be a butterfly."
01:22:52.426,01:22:53.677,Which is horseshit.
01:22:54.928,01:22:56.346,You hear him play this thing?
01:22:57.222,01:22:58.307,"Well, he can't."
01:23:01.226,01:23:02.269,How did you find him?
01:23:03.353,01:23:05.147,It's such an out-of-the-way apartment.
01:23:05.314,01:23:07.858,"-Can I fix you a drink? -No, thanks."
01:23:08.400,01:23:09.651,At the American Express.
01:23:12.696,01:23:13.864,Some kid.
01:23:15.282,01:23:21.830,"It's, uh… Are you living here?"
01:23:23.916,01:23:26.877,"No, no. I'm staying here for a few days."
01:23:45.979,01:23:47.189,Did this place come furnished?
01:23:49.900,01:23:54.321,"Because it doesn't look like Dickie's, uh… It's really horrible."
01:23:57.866,01:24:01.286,"It's so, uh… bourgeois."
01:24:10.963,01:24:13.048,"Oh, that's a, uh, you should not… Watch that."
01:24:16.343,01:24:17.594,Excuse me.
01:24:21.265,01:24:25.477,"You know, in fact, the only thing that looks like Dickie, is you."
01:24:26.395,01:24:27.854,-Hardly. -Hmm.
01:24:30.023,01:24:32.192,Have you done something to your hair?
01:24:33.151,01:24:34.903,"Is there something you'd like to say, Freddie?"
01:24:34.987,01:24:35.988,What?
01:24:36.071,01:24:38.782,-Do you have something you'd like to say? -I think I'm saying it.
01:24:41.034,01:24:42.369,Something's going on.
01:24:44.288,01:24:49.710,"Either he's converted to Christianity, or there's something else."
01:24:51.795,01:24:54.006,"Well, I would suggest you ask Dickie that yourself."
01:24:54.464,01:24:56.925,Otello's is on Della Croce just off the Corso.
01:25:06.810,01:25:10.606,"Last time, you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions."
01:25:11.481,01:25:14.735,That's not fair. You probably do know your ass from your elbow.
01:25:18.572,01:25:19.740,I'll see you.
01:25:43.263,01:25:44.931,"Ciao, Dickie."
01:25:48.352,01:25:49.269,Yeah.
01:25:49.811,01:25:51.355,Dickie doesn't play the piano.
01:25:55.525,01:25:56.610,Tommy!
01:25:57.736,01:25:58.862,Tommy!
01:26:41.405,01:26:46.451,"No. You're just so drunk. Oh. You're just… What can you do, eh?"
01:26:51.123,01:26:52.249,Yes!
01:26:52.916,01:26:54.209,Such a pig.
01:27:50.682,01:27:52.642,-La polizia. -Dickie Greenleaf?
01:27:53.268,01:27:54.186,Yes.
01:27:54.478,01:27:55.812,Inspector Roverini.
01:27:56.021,01:27:58.190,-Can we come in? -Please.
01:28:05.614,01:28:07.073,"It's a terrible shock, huh?"
01:28:08.241,01:28:11.203,What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
01:28:12.037,01:28:23.673,"Oh, um, I can't be certain exactly. I… Eight, nine… We'd both taken on, uh, far too many drinks."
01:28:25.175,01:28:28.678,"But it was dark, it was certainly dark, when I… when I walked him to his car."
01:28:30.013,01:28:32.682,"So he drove away, and, uh, you did what?"
01:28:32.849,01:28:34.059,I went to bed.
01:28:36.895,01:28:41.024,"Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks."
01:28:41.149,01:28:45.320,I've been suffering all… Who found him?
01:28:48.114,01:28:51.243,"You understand, I must ask you to stay in Rome, Signor Greenleaf."
01:28:52.244,01:28:54.663,"Yes, if it's gonna help, certainly."
01:28:55.330,01:29:02.963,"So, the doctor, he has to make the, um… Autopsia."
01:29:03.088,01:29:05.131,"-Postmortem. -Yeah, exactly."
01:29:05.882,01:29:13.473,"But, you know, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening."
01:29:13.682,01:29:16.852,"Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove away in his car."
01:29:19.938,01:29:20.981,No.
01:29:46.047,01:29:48.008,Tutto bene? Tutto okay?
01:29:49.050,01:29:50.343,"-Okay? -Si, si."
01:30:01.855,01:30:02.939,Did he kill Freddie?
01:30:03.815,01:30:05.358,Marge! When did you get here?
01:30:05.483,01:30:06.985,Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
01:30:07.277,01:30:08.904,I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
01:30:11.740,01:30:12.866,I tried again.
01:30:13.033,01:30:15.869,"Waiting here, watching for him."
01:30:16.870,01:30:19.372,"Instead, it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie, I find you."
01:30:22.042,01:30:23.460,What happened to your face?
01:30:24.794,01:30:26.254,Dickie… Dickie did it.
01:30:26.922,01:30:28.006,-Dickie? -My face.
01:30:28.173,01:30:34.721,"There was an argument. I… I said some things that I shouldn't have said and… About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us."
01:30:35.096,01:30:37.599,"And the next thing I know, he's launched himself at me."
01:30:38.308,01:30:39.768,-Are you getting on? -What?
01:30:40.101,01:30:41.519,Get on. I'll take you to him.
01:31:26.439,01:31:27.440,Where does he live?
01:31:27.524,01:31:29.901,We passed it a few blocks back. It's where the police were.
01:31:30.068,01:31:31.486,The Palazzo Gioia.
01:31:33.405,01:31:36.825,"Look, they don't even know I'm in Rome, and I'm not gonna incriminate Dickie."
01:31:36.908,01:31:38.326,"Well, perhaps I shouldn't go either."
01:31:38.410,01:31:42.122,"No, no. Well, go if you want to, but just don't talk to the police about my face."
01:31:42.205,01:31:45.750,"If they know he hit me and his temper, then he could've hit Freddie."
01:31:45.834,01:31:47.085,I'll catch up with you later.
01:32:09.607,01:32:11.276,"Ah, it's Signor Greenleaf! Presto, presto!"
01:32:19.284,01:32:20.326,Open up!
01:32:20.493,01:32:21.745,Hey!
01:32:25.206,01:32:26.416,Mr. Greenleaf!
01:32:28.793,01:32:30.503,Can we go up? Do you mind?
01:32:30.670,01:32:31.755,Of course.
01:32:31.963,01:32:33.381,What happened to your face?
01:32:33.506,01:32:36.634,My scooter. I fell off getting chased by photographers.
01:32:37.218,01:32:40.346,"The telephone, the press, I've been… I'm feeling hounded."
01:32:41.306,01:32:43.391,Do you think you could not give out my address?
01:32:43.558,01:32:48.146,"Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no, even to your fiancée."
01:32:48.229,01:32:49.898,I really don't want to see anybody.
01:32:57.989,01:32:59.240,What about Tom Ripley?
01:33:01.201,01:33:03.244,You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo. Is that right?
01:33:03.369,01:33:06.331,"Yes, we, we went to San Remo. That was months ago."
01:33:06.539,01:33:08.333,"-November, I thought. -Was it?"
01:33:08.792,01:33:10.043,Did you speak to Tom?
01:33:10.126,01:33:12.170,November 7th is my information.
01:33:12.378,01:33:14.380,I don't remember the exact date.
01:33:15.423,01:33:17.467,When did you last see Signor Ripley?
01:33:17.675,01:33:18.718,A few days ago.
01:33:21.930,01:33:22.931,No.
01:33:28.937,01:33:33.066,"Two days ago, Freddie Miles is dead, hmm?"
01:33:34.359,01:33:39.114,"He leaves your apartment, and he's murdered."
01:33:40.740,01:33:45.829,"Yesterday, a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks."
01:33:45.954,01:33:49.666,And the owner tells the police it was stolen on November 7th.
01:33:51.543,01:33:58.883,We look at hotel records and we see Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo.
01:33:59.759,01:34:02.971,And then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat.
01:34:03.471,01:34:06.182,That is not a pattern. That's a coincidence.
01:34:06.307,01:34:08.309,There must be 50 hotels in San Remo.
01:34:08.393,01:34:10.728,There were probably a hundred people renting a boat that day.
01:34:11.479,01:34:12.564,Thirty-one people.
01:34:13.815,01:34:14.774,Thirty-one people?
01:34:15.483,01:34:16.526,Hmm.
01:34:17.360,01:34:18.611,"Thirty-one, yeah."
01:34:21.114,01:34:23.658,-Marge Sherwood. -That is Miss Sherwood now.
01:34:32.333,01:34:33.376,Let her in.
01:34:34.586,01:34:37.172,Let her in. What's the difference? Let her in.
01:34:44.220,01:34:48.641,I would… I would really appreciate it if… If you would ask Miss Sherwood to come back later.
01:34:54.731,01:34:55.857,Thank you.
01:34:57.692,01:34:59.152,May I ask you...
01:35:00.236,01:35:02.822,why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
01:35:03.656,01:35:06.242,"Well, I… I think I just said."
01:35:06.659,01:35:10.496,"Um, Mr. Ripley was handling some business for me."
01:35:10.705,01:35:17.253,Nor does Mr. Ripley want to marry me and ask me every single day if I'll marry him and when.
01:35:18.421,01:35:20.465,Do you keep a photograph of Signor Ripley?
01:35:20.798,01:35:23.676,I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
01:35:26.095,01:35:27.847,Now I think I've upset you.
01:35:28.431,01:35:31.809,"Sorry. My English, perhaps, is coarse."
01:35:31.893,01:35:33.519,"It is a little coarse, yes."
01:35:37.941,01:35:38.942,I'm sorry.
01:35:40.610,01:35:44.197,But you… No one has seen Signor Ripley since San Remo.
01:35:44.322,01:35:45.531,"-I have. -You have, yes."
01:35:45.615,01:35:47.825,And so has Miss Sherwood. Ask her.
01:35:48.159,01:35:55.166,"And, um, if I can remember the name of the hotel he was staying at, The Goldoni."
01:35:55.708,01:35:57.168,Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
01:35:57.460,01:35:58.544,Goldoni.
01:35:59.003,01:36:02.465,"The Goldoni. Good, good, yes, you are right."
01:36:03.967,01:36:05.593,You are right. A coincidence.
01:36:09.430,01:36:11.307,I look forward to our next meeting.
01:36:11.557,01:36:13.518,Hmm? When I will be more careful with my English.
01:36:18.147,01:36:19.774,getting into Mr. Miles' car.
01:36:20.149,01:36:23.695,And she wants to identify you in a confronto.
01:36:23.987,01:36:26.447,"Lineup. Tomorrow, then?"
01:36:28.032,01:36:29.450,"Uh, tomorrow."
01:37:01.149,01:37:02.191,Dick?
01:37:06.529,01:37:07.572,Dickie?
01:37:10.199,01:37:11.868,I know you can hear me.
01:37:21.002,01:37:26.215,"I was gonna say that I would count to three, and if you didn't open the door… But I won't count anymore."
01:37:28.634,01:37:29.761,On you.
01:37:32.722,01:37:36.267,I won't count on you anymore.
01:37:39.729,01:37:46.402,"Whatever it is you've done or haven't done, you've broken my heart."
01:37:49.364,01:37:51.532,That's one thing I know you're guilty of.
01:38:04.253,01:38:07.423,I don't know why. I just don't know why.
01:38:23.523,01:38:30.196,"Freddie's death, Silvana… I've thought about going to the police, but I can't do it."
01:38:31.280,01:38:32.490,I can't face it.
01:38:33.741,01:38:35.326,I can't face anything anymore.
01:38:36.536,01:38:39.455,I wish I could give you the life I took for granted.
01:38:42.417,01:38:45.044,"You've always understood what's at the heart of me, Tom."
01:38:45.169,01:38:46.504,Marge never could.
01:38:48.297,01:38:53.469,"I suppose that's why I'm writing this to you, the brother I never had."
01:38:55.054,01:38:57.265,The only true friend I ever had.
01:39:03.020,01:39:07.650,"In all kinds of ways, you're much more like the son my father wanted."
01:39:09.485,01:39:17.952,"I realize you can change the people, change the scenery, but you can't change your own rotten self."
01:39:20.371,01:39:23.249,Now I can't think what to do or where to go.
01:39:25.084,01:39:28.713,I'm haunted by everything I've done and can't undo.
01:39:31.340,01:39:32.341,I'm sorry.
01:39:35.303,01:39:38.097,"I've made a mess of being Dickie Greenleaf, haven't I?"
01:40:48.543,01:40:50.002,I'll see you over there!
01:40:59.971,01:41:02.139,"I'm so sorry to put you through this, Peter."
01:41:02.306,01:41:06.018,I just can't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
01:41:06.102,01:41:07.728,Don't be so daft. It's fine.
01:41:08.187,01:41:10.147,I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice.
01:41:10.731,01:41:13.526,"I'm delighted, contrary to rumor, that you're still in one piece."
01:41:13.609,01:41:15.278,"-What rumor? -Oh, you know."
01:41:15.361,01:41:17.863,That Dickie murdered you and is traveling under your passport.
01:41:19.031,01:41:20.741,I know. It's ridiculous.
01:41:36.090,01:41:37.425,Welcome to Venice.
01:41:37.925,01:41:40.094,"God, this place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it?"
01:41:41.596,01:41:44.724,"Anyway, I've got to the bottom of the delay, finally."
01:41:45.224,01:41:46.809,We're waiting for someone from Rome.
01:41:47.727,01:41:50.438,What do you mean? They've sent for someone from Rome?
01:41:51.439,01:41:52.732,"Well, yes. That's good, isn't it?"
01:41:52.815,01:41:56.319,"No, no. I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region is separate."
01:41:59.030,01:42:01.741,"Well, you've read the papers. You know what a big deal it's been."
01:42:02.325,01:42:03.826,American tourist murdered.
01:42:27.224,01:42:36.651,"He's taken over the case, um, because they're annoyed that the previous chap let Dickie disappear when he was, um, the only suspect in Freddie's murder."
01:42:40.154,01:42:41.989,"In Rome, about three weeks ago."
01:42:43.532,01:42:44.742,I knew that one.
01:42:53.000,01:42:54.460,Are you a homosexual?
01:42:55.086,01:42:56.837,Interesting non sequitur.
01:42:57.129,01:42:58.047,No.
01:43:00.591,01:43:01.926,-No. -Oh.
01:43:02.718,01:43:06.305,"By the way, um, officially there are no Italian homosexuals."
01:43:07.682,01:43:10.017,Makes Michelangelo and Leonardo very inconvenient.
01:43:11.352,01:43:14.897,-Eh? -Tell him… I have a fiancée.
01:43:15.398,01:43:16.899,And Dickie has a fiancée.
01:43:17.775,01:43:19.860,And that Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
01:43:40.631,01:43:42.550,"-What did he say? -He says, So many fiancées."
01:43:50.975,01:43:52.518,and then killed Dickie Greenleaf.
01:43:52.601,01:43:53.644,No!
01:43:53.769,01:43:56.564,"No, I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf."
01:43:56.647,01:43:59.483,Is he accusing me? Are you… Ask him if he's accusing me.
01:43:59.567,01:44:01.652,"The way it works here, it's better to be less volatile."
01:44:01.736,01:44:02.778,But it's absurd.
01:44:20.629,01:44:22.923,They found this in Dickie's place in Rome.
01:44:25.217,01:44:26.093,You opened this?
01:44:26.886,01:44:28.053,Of course.
01:44:44.153,01:44:45.404,It's a suicide note.
01:44:50.785,01:44:54.079,You asked me all these questions and you already read this suicide note?
01:45:12.848,01:45:14.517,I don't believe that letter. Do you?
01:45:15.184,01:45:17.311,Dickie's letter. Do you believe it?
01:45:18.854,01:45:20.231,I don't know what to believe.
01:45:21.273,01:45:24.026,"Can you imagine, though, if he did kill Freddie, what that must be like?"
01:45:26.862,01:45:29.198,"Just to wake up every morning. I mean, how can you?"
01:45:30.032,01:45:32.117,Just wake up and be a person?
01:45:32.243,01:45:33.369,Drink your coffee.
01:45:33.744,01:45:39.500,"Well, whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful, it all makes sense, doesn't it?"
01:45:40.251,01:45:41.293,In your head.
01:45:41.460,01:45:43.921,You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person.
01:45:44.421,01:45:47.383,"No, I know, but you're still tormented. You must be. You've killed someone."
01:45:47.758,01:45:53.472,"Don't you just take the past and put it in a room in the basement, and lock the door and never go in there?"
01:45:54.431,01:45:56.392,"-That's what I do. -God, yes."
01:45:57.226,01:45:59.728,"But, of course, in my case, it's probably a whole building."
01:46:02.898,01:46:08.028,"And then you meet someone special, and all you want to do is toss them the key."
01:46:10.322,01:46:12.825,Say Open up. Step inside.
01:46:15.661,01:46:16.829,But you can't.
01:46:17.955,01:46:22.209,Because it's dark… …and there are demons.
01:46:24.461,01:46:34.013,And if anybody saw how ugly it is… Now that's the music talking.
01:46:36.015,01:46:38.684,"It's harder to be bleak if you're playing Knees Up, Mother Brown."
01:46:45.065,01:46:46.650,I keep wanting to do that.
01:46:48.360,01:46:50.529,Fling the door open.
01:46:54.617,01:46:57.036,"Just let the light in, clean everything out."
01:47:00.581,01:47:31.362,"If I could take a giant eraser and rub out everything, starting with myself… The thing is, Peter, if… If… No key, huh?"
01:48:16.907,01:48:18.200,-Marge. -Peter.
01:48:21.203,01:48:23.288,"-So good to see you. -Hello, Marge."
01:48:23.414,01:48:24.456,Tom.
01:48:25.791,01:48:27.209,I see you found Peter.
01:48:27.292,01:48:29.086,"Well, I think we sort of found each other."
01:48:29.962,01:48:31.213,Where's Dickie's father?
01:48:31.880,01:48:33.507,He's not coming till the morning.
01:48:33.590,01:48:35.134,Evidently his stomach.
01:48:35.384,01:48:37.344,I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
01:48:37.469,01:48:39.138,"Oh, I was looking forward to seeing him."
01:48:39.263,01:48:41.515,Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that.
01:48:42.099,01:48:44.184,There's a private detective on the case now.
01:48:44.768,01:48:47.229,A Mr. MacCarron Dickie's father's employed.
01:48:47.312,01:48:50.024,-That's a terrific idea. -He's American.
01:48:50.816,01:48:55.821,"He's already discovered that Dickie cashed checks for $1,000 the day before he disappeared."
01:48:59.450,01:49:01.785,Is that what you do before you jump into the Tiber?
01:49:02.036,01:49:03.370,I don't think so.
01:49:08.208,01:49:10.169,"-Is this you? -No, it's Tom's."
01:49:10.919,01:49:11.962,"Splendid, eh?"
01:49:12.629,01:49:13.672,Golly.
01:49:14.465,01:49:15.883,Who's paying for this?
01:49:15.966,01:49:17.426,Peter found it for me.
01:49:17.843,01:49:22.806,I can afford it because it's damp and… falling down.
01:49:26.185,01:49:28.270,That's why Tom wanted you to stay.
01:49:31.440,01:49:33.317,And I know how you hate hotels.
01:49:33.567,01:49:35.277,A hotel would have been fine.
01:49:38.822,01:49:41.825,We'll have to tell Mr. Greenleaf how far his dollar stretched.
01:49:48.916,01:49:49.792,What's funny?
01:49:50.167,01:49:53.045,I was just thinking about when Tom first came to Mongibello.
01:49:55.547,01:49:57.132,And look at you now.
01:49:58.050,01:49:58.926,Look at me what?
01:50:00.385,01:50:01.595,To the manor born.
01:50:23.075,01:50:24.201,Mr. Greenleaf?
01:50:24.493,01:50:25.452,Tom.
01:50:26.620,01:50:27.955,How are you? You look well.
01:50:28.747,01:50:31.291,"-Thank you, sir. I am well. -Far cry from New York."
01:50:33.710,01:50:34.837,Good morning.
01:50:35.087,01:50:36.338,Unusual weather.
01:50:36.755,01:50:39.133,"-Very. -And you, sir. Any better?"
01:50:39.883,01:50:42.636,Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
01:50:43.011,01:50:45.222,-Where's Mr. MacCarron? -San Remo.
01:50:45.889,01:50:47.891,The police are amateurs.
01:50:48.559,01:50:52.646,"Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?"
01:50:53.480,01:50:56.275,What is the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
01:50:56.358,01:50:57.609,He's being thorough.
01:50:58.652,01:51:00.529,"I'm learning about my son, Tom."
01:51:01.029,01:51:07.536,"Now he's missing, I'm learning a great deal about him, and I hope that you can fill in some more blanks for me."
01:51:07.619,01:51:10.289,Marge has been good enough to do that about Mongibello.
01:51:10.414,01:51:11.623,"I'll try my best, sir."
01:51:17.296,01:51:19.173,the letter he left for you.
01:51:19.464,01:51:26.388,"The police… think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something, uh, to himself."
01:51:27.055,01:51:28.307,I just don't believe that.
01:51:29.391,01:51:31.476,"You don't want to, dear."
01:51:35.606,01:51:37.107,I'd like to talk to Tom alone.
01:51:37.983,01:51:40.068,Perhaps this afternoon. Would you mind?
01:51:43.238,01:51:53.415,"Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow… Such as?"
01:52:02.049,01:52:04.760,I'd pay that fellow $100 right now to shut up!
01:52:13.268,01:52:15.437,"No, Marge doesn't know the half of it."
01:52:17.147,01:52:18.649,And his passport photo.
01:52:19.983,01:52:22.736,Did you hear? To scratch out his own face like that?
01:52:22.903,01:52:24.029,Can you imagine?
01:52:25.280,01:52:27.532,Frame of mind you'd have to be in?
01:52:29.576,01:52:31.995,"I've thought about going to the police, but I can't face it."
01:52:32.079,01:52:34.623,I can't face anything anymore.
01:52:34.915,01:52:35.999,I feel guilty.
01:52:36.792,01:52:38.377,I feel like I pushed him away.
01:52:39.253,01:52:40.921,I feel like I spoke and he heard you.
01:52:44.007,01:52:49.221,"If we all pushed him away, what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son."
01:52:49.888,01:52:52.015,Everything is someone else's fault.
01:52:53.016,01:52:59.690,"We all want to sow wild oats, but somebody's got to… got to… What is the word?"
01:53:01.316,01:53:06.989,"You know, the moment someone confronts him, he lashes out."
01:53:08.490,01:53:09.658,He always has.
01:53:11.493,01:53:21.545,"You know, people always say that you can't choose your parents… but you can't choose your children."
01:53:51.325,01:53:52.492,Coming.
01:53:55.287,01:53:56.580,I must have fallen asleep.
01:53:56.663,01:53:57.956,Did Dickie's dad go?
01:53:58.040,01:53:59.958,"You look ghastly, Tom. Did you have a nightmare?"
01:54:00.042,01:54:01.460,He's having an early night.
01:54:03.503,01:54:05.672,"You know, we were banging on that door forever."
01:54:11.553,01:54:13.180,I think I've broken a strap.
01:54:13.430,01:54:14.556,Not guilty.
01:54:15.223,01:54:16.641,I'll fix some drinks.
01:54:18.143,01:54:20.729,Ah! You walk in Venice.
01:54:22.314,01:54:23.357,Are you okay?
01:54:27.486,01:54:29.112,Did you want me to stick around?
01:54:30.113,01:54:31.698,"No, it's okay."
01:54:33.784,01:54:34.993,I could come back.
01:54:51.551,01:54:52.552,Your key.
01:55:00.143,01:55:03.063,"Marge, I'm in the bath. I won't be long."
01:55:09.569,01:55:10.529,Coming.
01:55:22.833,01:55:24.376,I found Dickie's rings.
01:55:24.626,01:55:25.669,What?
01:55:26.503,01:55:28.130,You have Dickie's rings.
01:55:33.343,01:55:34.678,I can explain.
01:55:35.512,01:55:37.639,Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
01:55:37.764,01:55:40.225,Let me put some clothes on and we'll talk about this.
01:55:40.308,01:55:43.478,"-I have to tell Mr. Greenleaf. -Marge, you're being hysterical."
01:55:43.603,01:55:48.608,"He promised me, I swear, I will never take off this ring -until we get… -Shut up!"
01:55:51.319,01:55:52.529,"I'm wet, Marge."
01:55:52.821,01:55:54.197,I've lost my towel.
01:55:55.323,01:55:57.200,And I'd really like to put some clothes on.
01:55:58.076,01:55:59.619,Go and pour us both a drink.
01:56:03.373,01:56:04.458,Pour us a drink.
01:56:38.533,01:56:39.576,Marge?
01:56:40.911,01:56:42.245,Where are you going?
01:56:43.997,01:56:49.669,I wasn't snooping. I just… I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
01:56:51.880,01:56:53.215,That scent you're wearing.
01:56:55.550,01:56:57.052,I bought that for you.
01:56:59.221,01:57:02.724,"The thing about Dickie, so many things."
01:57:05.810,01:57:10.524,"That day when he was late coming back from Rome, I tried to tell you this."
01:57:10.815,01:57:12.442,He was with another girl.
01:57:12.609,01:57:14.694,"I'm not talking about Meredith, either."
01:57:14.778,01:57:16.905,Another girl that we met in a bar.
01:57:17.822,01:57:20.450,He couldn't be faithful for five minutes.
01:57:21.368,01:57:26.957,"So when he makes a promise, it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise or I make a promise."
01:57:27.916,01:57:31.711,"He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all."
01:57:32.170,01:57:34.673,He lies. He lies.
01:57:35.006,01:57:39.177,And that's his… And half the time he doesn't even realize he's doing it.
01:57:40.220,01:57:45.934,"And today, I really started wondering whether he may have killed Freddie."
01:57:47.602,01:57:50.438,He would get so crazy if anybody would contradict him.
01:57:50.522,01:57:51.648,"Well, you know that."
01:57:51.856,01:57:53.108,You know that.
01:57:53.942,01:57:55.068,You know that.
01:57:55.777,01:57:57.112,"And that's the irony, Marge."
01:57:58.655,01:57:59.698,I loved you.
01:58:00.448,01:58:02.576,"You may as well know, Marge. I loved you."
01:58:02.951,01:58:10.292,"I don't know, maybe it's grotesque of me to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something and put it in your purse for a rainy day."
01:58:10.625,01:58:11.710,Tom loves me.
01:58:12.961,01:58:14.254,Tom loves me.
01:58:14.963,01:58:16.506,Why do you have Dickie's rings?
01:58:16.673,01:58:18.508,I told you. He gave them to me.
01:58:18.717,01:58:20.510,Why? When?
01:58:20.594,01:58:23.430,I feel as if you haven't been listening to anything I've been saying to you.
01:58:26.891,01:58:28.184,It's all true.
01:58:28.310,01:58:31.563,I don't believe a single word you've said.
01:58:33.815,01:58:35.358,"You're shivering, Marge."
01:58:36.026,01:58:39.529,"Look at you. Marge, can I hold you?"
01:58:40.488,01:58:41.865,Will you let me hold you?
01:58:44.618,01:58:46.077,"Peter! Oh, Peter."
01:58:50.665,01:58:51.791,Please!
01:58:56.338,01:58:59.174,You try. You try talking to her.
01:59:09.351,01:59:10.518,that I've ever done to her.
01:59:10.602,01:59:12.228,"Listen, you can't be angry with her."
01:59:13.688,01:59:15.982,"She's confused, and she needs someone to blame."
01:59:17.067,01:59:18.443,So she blames you.
01:59:22.030,01:59:26.493,"As for you, either get a safety razor or grow a beard."
01:59:39.714,01:59:40.924,Is Mr. Greenleaf here?
01:59:41.299,01:59:42.467,Mr. Ripley?
01:59:42.884,01:59:45.303,-Yes. -I'm Alvin MacCarron.
01:59:58.983,02:00:03.863,"Marge, you should have waited. I didn't… Didn't Peter say I'd come by and pick you up?"
02:00:05.156,02:00:07.659,Marge has been telling us about the rings.
02:00:07.742,02:00:10.412,"Yes, I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday."
02:00:10.495,02:00:12.664,I clean forgot. Ridiculous.
02:00:15.291,02:00:18.878,Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn.
02:00:21.047,02:00:23.049,I'm going to take Marge for a little walk.
02:00:23.133,02:00:24.968,"Tom, Mr. MacCarron needs to talk to you."
02:00:25.051,02:00:27.429,"Uh, there's no need. We could go to the bar. There's no need."
02:00:27.512,02:00:28.513,"No, no."
02:00:29.764,02:00:31.474,I think you should stay here.
02:00:53.747,02:00:55.749,I could probably see my room from here.
02:00:56.374,02:00:57.625,I can see my house.
02:01:00.128,02:01:03.131,"When you see where you live from a distance, it's like a dream, isn't it?"
02:01:04.549,02:01:05.884,I don't care for BS.
02:01:06.801,02:01:09.471,I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it.
02:01:12.015,02:01:12.974,Okay.
02:01:13.099,02:01:16.060,Did you know that at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-killed a boy?
02:01:17.312,02:01:18.897,At a party over some girl.
02:01:19.939,02:01:22.692,"Kicked the kid several times in the head, put him in the hospital."
02:01:23.693,02:01:26.821,"Boy had a wire fixed in his jaw, lost some hearing."
02:01:27.447,02:01:30.283,Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place?
02:01:33.453,02:01:36.080,The Rome police didn't think to ask Mr. Greenleaf.
02:01:37.707,02:01:43.379,Nor did they think to check on whether a Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at Princeton University.
02:01:44.047,02:01:52.514,"Oh, I turned up a Tom Ripley who had been a… piano tuner in the music department."
02:01:53.932,02:02:00.188,"You see, in America, we are taught to check a fact before it becomes a fact."
02:02:00.939,02:02:02.690,We're taught to nose around.
02:02:03.024,02:02:07.779,"When a girl drowns herself, find out if that girl is pregnant."
02:02:08.404,02:02:10.782,Find out if Dickie had an embarrassment there.
02:02:12.867,02:02:15.203,Mr. Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty. He really does.
02:02:16.412,02:02:18.665,"Marge, she has a hundred theories."
02:02:19.457,02:02:21.459,There are a few things that she doesn't know.
02:02:22.585,02:02:24.003,We hope she never knows.
02:02:25.088,02:02:26.548,I hope she never knows.
02:02:27.257,02:02:31.177,Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie's car.
02:02:32.971,02:02:42.480,"One man, who will not testify because he was jumping somebody else's wife at the time, saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car."
02:02:43.523,02:02:47.485,The police know about this man because he happens to be a policeman.
02:02:49.571,02:02:51.739,I found these in the basement of Dickie's apartment.
02:02:52.907,02:02:54.576,They belong to Freddie's car.
02:02:55.159,02:03:01.916,Mr. Greenleaf has asked me… to lose these in the canal this evening.
02:03:07.755,02:03:13.011,Mr. Greenleaf feels that there was a silent promise in Dickie's letter to you which he intends to honor.
02:03:13.887,02:03:19.934,He also intends to transfer a good portion of Dickie's income from his trust into your name.
02:03:20.894,02:03:26.399,He does not intend to give the Italians any information about Dickie's past.
02:03:28.610,02:03:31.738,He's rather hoping that you will feel the same.
02:03:50.715,02:03:52.258,"-Thank you so much, Tom. -Sir."
02:03:52.383,02:03:53.718,-Good-bye. -Good-bye.
02:03:59.098,02:04:03.353,"Marge, I feel I never should have said those things to you the other evening."
02:04:03.561,02:04:09.192,"I was pretty flustered, and the rings, and you looked so… I don't know."
02:04:10.401,02:04:15.323,But I hope that note goes in your purse to New York for a rainy day.
02:04:18.076,02:04:19.994,"What are you gonna do now, Tom?"
02:04:20.328,02:04:26.584,"I don't know, um… Peter has a concert in Athens next month, so he asked me to come along and help out."
02:04:29.337,02:04:30.630,He says good-bye.
02:04:31.130,02:04:36.844,"By the way, he was in rehearsal so he couldn't… Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?"
02:04:37.804,02:04:38.680,What?
02:04:40.390,02:04:43.935,I know it was you. I know it was you.
02:04:44.060,02:04:45.353,-I know it was you! -Marge!
02:04:48.856,02:04:50.566,I know you killed Dickie!
02:04:58.408,02:05:00.618,It's not Tom. Really.
02:05:23.391,02:05:25.268,Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
02:05:25.518,02:05:27.812,I don't know. What do you want to change about this moment?
02:05:27.979,02:05:29.105,Nothing.
02:05:33.776,02:05:36.112,I'm freezing. Coming down?
02:05:36.237,02:05:38.865,Later. I want to catch the sunset.
02:05:42.201,02:05:43.286,I am.
02:05:58.259,02:05:59.427,Dickie?
02:06:03.765,02:06:04.807,Dickie!
02:06:17.528,02:06:18.571,"Oh, my God."
02:06:21.407,02:06:22.533,"Hello, Meredith."
02:06:25.870,02:06:27.705,I was looking at you.
02:06:28.372,02:06:31.375,Your clothes. I wouldn't have known you.
02:06:31.709,02:06:34.337,"Well, you spotted me, so you get the reward."
02:06:36.214,02:06:38.049,-What? -Just kidding.
02:06:39.050,02:06:40.343,Are you alone?
02:06:41.052,02:06:42.011,Oh.
02:06:43.096,02:06:45.807,Hardly. Couldn't be less alone.
02:06:46.307,02:06:48.559,-Aunt Joan. -And co.
02:06:51.813,02:06:53.356,A lot of co.
02:06:54.941,02:06:56.025,"Oh, God."
02:07:03.407,02:07:08.246,I've thought about you… so much.
02:07:08.913,02:07:10.540,And I've thought about you.
02:07:12.416,02:07:15.419,"Yeah, well, when I thought about you, I was mostly hating you."
02:07:22.552,02:07:24.387,Where have you been hiding?
02:07:25.012,02:07:26.472,I haven't been hiding.
02:07:28.641,02:07:30.476,I've been in police custody.
02:07:32.019,02:07:34.188,They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
02:07:36.149,02:07:39.694,"Well, that's… They're giving me this vacation, which is why the getup."
02:07:40.528,02:07:42.155,Which is why you haven't heard from me.
02:07:42.238,02:07:44.824,"You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie."
02:07:45.366,02:07:47.910,-Oh! It's terrible. -I know.
02:07:48.619,02:07:51.289,"Listen, I can't talk now. Um, later?"
02:07:55.209,02:07:56.419,Later?
02:07:57.336,02:07:58.296,Later?
02:08:09.098,02:08:18.441,So… Are you traveling under R?
02:08:24.947,02:08:28.451,"Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-Kingsley? I bet you are."
02:08:29.118,02:08:30.953,My aunt thought she saw him.
02:08:31.871,02:08:33.748,Peter Smith-Kingsley? No.
02:08:34.081,02:08:35.583,I haven't seen him in months.
02:08:37.710,02:08:38.836,"No, I'm alone."
02:08:59.315,02:09:00.274,Hi.
02:09:04.153,02:09:05.071,How was it?
02:09:05.321,02:09:06.447,It was good.
02:09:07.281,02:09:12.161,But I'll tell you something. I want us to stay in here for the rest of the trip.
02:09:17.083,02:09:18.334,Was that Meredith?
02:09:21.963,02:09:23.130,Was who Meredith?
02:09:23.798,02:09:26.801,Meredith Logue. You were kissing someone. It looked like Meredith.
02:09:34.225,02:09:35.685,I came out to find you.
02:09:37.353,02:09:38.729,"Oh, hardly kissing."
02:09:43.150,02:09:44.193,It didn't look that way...
02:09:45.486,02:09:47.738,"you know, from a distance."
02:09:52.827,02:09:55.162,I lied to her.
02:09:56.706,02:09:58.457,She thought she'd seen you.
02:10:02.461,02:10:05.589,Dickie and Peter together? That's just too good gossip.
02:10:06.674,02:10:08.259,"Or Tom and Peter, even."
02:10:08.926,02:10:10.511,That would be even better gossip.
02:10:10.970,02:10:12.013,Really? Why?
02:10:18.144,02:10:22.481,I… I… Um… I'm completely lost.
02:10:25.151,02:10:26.319,I know.
02:10:28.195,02:10:29.613,"I'm sorry, Peter."
02:10:31.699,02:10:32.867,I'm lost.
02:10:36.746,02:10:39.040,"I'm gonna be stuck in the basement, aren't I?"
02:10:44.045,02:10:53.179,That's my… Terrible… and alone.
02:10:53.971,02:10:55.348,And dark.
02:10:57.641,02:11:05.149,And I've lied… about who I am… and where I am.
02:11:05.441,02:11:07.568,Now no one'll ever find me.
02:11:10.112,02:11:11.906,"What do you mean, lied about who you are?"
02:11:12.198,02:11:19.580,I always thought it'd be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
02:11:20.873,02:11:22.083,What are you talking about?
02:11:23.042,02:11:25.503,You're not a nobody. That's the last thing you are.
02:11:33.677,02:11:39.850,Peter… Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley.
02:11:42.103,02:11:56.033,"No, don't get up. Don't get up. Don't get up… Just… Just tell me some nice things about Tom Ripley."
02:11:59.036,02:12:00.913,Good things about Tom Ripley.
02:12:04.542,02:12:06.377,That could take me some time.
02:12:08.921,02:12:10.381,Tom is talented.
02:12:11.549,02:12:12.842,Tom is tender.
02:12:14.301,02:12:15.761,Tom is beautiful.
02:12:17.138,02:12:18.889,You're such a liar.
02:12:21.892,02:12:24.103,Tom is… Tom is a mystery.
02:12:37.199,02:12:42.413,"Tom has secrets he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he would."
02:12:47.543,02:12:49.128,Tom has nightmares.
02:12:54.008,02:12:55.426,That's not a good thing.
02:13:01.140,02:13:03.184,Tom has someone to love him.
02:13:05.769,02:13:07.271,That is a good thing.
02:13:10.566,02:13:12.735,Mm. Tom is crushing me.
02:13:27.208,02:13:28.334,"Oh, God!"
