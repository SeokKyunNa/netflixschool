00:00:38.163,00:00:40.624,and a few degrees south of freezing to death.
00:00:40.666,00:00:44.043,It's located solidly on the meridian of misery.
00:00:45.253,00:00:48.799,My village.
00:00:48.841,00:00:53.595,"It's been here for seven generations, but every single building is new."
00:00:53.637,00:00:58.141,"We have fishing, hunting and a charming view of the sunsets."
00:00:58.183,00:01:02.062,The only problems are the pests.
00:01:02.103,00:01:05.691,"You see, most places have mice or mosquitoes."
00:01:05.733,00:01:08.193,We have...
00:01:10.779,00:01:13.323,...dragons.
00:01:13.365,00:01:16.326,would leave. Not us.
00:01:16.368,00:01:19.914,We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues.
00:01:21.832,00:01:24.083,My name is Hiccup.
00:01:24.125,00:01:26.754,"Great name, I know."
00:01:26.795,00:01:30.591,Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off gnomes and trolls.
00:01:30.632,00:01:32.968,Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn't do that.
00:01:37.180,00:01:39.307,- What are you doing here?!
00:01:39.349,00:01:41.769,- What are you doing out?!
00:01:44.271,00:01:46.982,Hiccup!
00:01:47.024,00:01:49.276,What are you doing out?!
00:01:49.317,00:01:52.947,"the Vast, chief of the tribe."
00:01:52.988,00:01:57.952,"They say when he was a baby, he popped a dragon's head clean off its shoulders."
00:01:57.993,00:02:00.161,Do I believe it?
00:02:00.203,00:02:01.329,What have we got?
00:02:01.371,00:02:03.331,Gronckles. Nadders.
00:02:03.373,00:02:05.667,"Oh, and Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare."
00:02:06.877,00:02:08.837,- Any Night Furies?
00:02:08.879,00:02:09.964,Good.
00:02:17.721,00:02:19.890,Oh! Nice of you to join the party!
00:02:19.932,00:02:21.433,I thought you'd been carried off!
00:02:21.475,00:02:26.229,"Who, me? Come on, I'm way too muscular for their taste."
00:02:26.271,00:02:29.316,They wouldn't know what to do with all this.
00:02:29.357,00:02:32.277,"They need toothpicks, don't they?"
00:02:32.319,00:02:35.990,with attitude and interchangeable hands is Gobber.
00:02:36.031,00:02:38.366,I've been his apprentice since I was little.
00:02:38.408,00:02:40.869,"Well, littler."
00:02:40.911,00:02:44.414,Move to the lower defenses.
00:02:47.084,00:02:50.462,"See? Old village, lots and lots of new houses."
00:02:50.504,00:02:51.964,Fire!
00:02:53.465,00:02:57.845,"That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins: Ruffnut and Tuffnut..."
00:02:57.886,00:03:00.014,...and...
00:03:01.180,00:03:03.182,...Astrid.
00:03:12.734,00:03:15.236,"Oh, their job is so much cooler."
00:03:15.278,00:03:18.490,- Eh!
00:03:18.532,00:03:19.867,I need to make my mark.
00:03:19.908,00:03:22.828,"You've made plenty of marks, all in the wrong places."
00:03:22.870,00:03:24.955,"Please, two minutes."
00:03:24.997,00:03:28.542,My life will get infinitely better.
00:03:28.583,00:03:30.961,You can't lift a hammer.
00:03:31.003,00:03:32.379,You can't even throw one of these!
00:03:35.049,00:03:37.843,"OK, fine, but this will throw it for me."
00:03:37.885,00:03:39.720,- Ohh!
00:03:39.761,00:03:42.514,See? Now this right here is what I'm talking about!
00:03:42.556,00:03:44.933,calibration issue...
00:03:44.975,00:03:48.228,If you ever want to get out there to fight dragons...
00:03:48.269,00:03:51.231,...you need to stop all this.
00:03:51.272,00:03:53.400,But you just pointed to all of me.
00:03:53.441,00:03:56.319,"Yes, that's it!"
00:03:56.361,00:03:59.280,- Ohh...
00:03:59.322,00:04:02.159,"You, sir, are playing a dangerous game."
00:04:02.201,00:04:06.371,Keeping this much raw Vikingness contained?
00:04:06.413,00:04:08.331,There will be consequences!
00:04:08.373,00:04:11.251,I'll take my chances.
00:04:13.045,00:04:15.422,I'll get out there.
00:04:15.463,00:04:17.257,Because killing a dragon...
00:04:17.298,00:04:20.343,...is everything around here.
00:04:20.385,00:04:23.931,A Nadder head is sure to get me at least noticed.
00:04:23.972,00:04:26.850,Gronckles are tough.
00:04:23.972,00:04:28.852,Taking down one of those would definitely get me a girlfriend.
00:04:29.770,00:04:30.979,A Zippleback?
00:04:32.773,00:04:35.150,twice the status.
00:04:35.192,00:04:36.651,They found the sheep!
00:04:36.693,00:04:38.862,Concentrate fire over the lower bank.
00:04:38.904,00:04:41.615,- Fire!
00:04:41.656,00:04:44.451,And then there's the Monstrous Nightmare.
00:04:44.492,00:04:47.579,Only the best Vikings go after those.
00:04:47.621,00:04:50.665,They have this nasty habit of setting themselves on fire.
00:04:53.210,00:04:55.336,Reload!
00:04:57.172,00:05:01.176,But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one's ever seen.
00:05:01.218,00:05:03.220,- We call it the...
00:05:03.262,00:05:05.305,- Get down!
00:05:07.808,00:05:10.144,Jump!
00:05:10.185,00:05:14.231,"This thing never steals food, never shows itself, and..."
00:05:15.649,00:05:17.442,...never misses.
00:05:17.484,00:05:19.736,No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
00:05:19.778,00:05:22.447,That's why I'm going to be the first.
00:05:22.489,00:05:25.450,"Man the fort, Hiccup."
00:05:26.827,00:05:29.704,Stay. Put. There.
00:05:31.123,00:05:34.001,You know what I mean.
00:05:34.042,00:05:36.335,"- Yeah, I know!"
00:05:36.377,00:05:38.337,- Be right back!
00:05:47.388,00:05:49.348,The devils still have some juice in them!
00:05:59.400,00:06:01.778,Come on.
00:06:01.820,00:06:05.199,- Give me something to shoot at.
00:06:18.586,00:06:19.629,- Aah!
00:06:25.384,00:06:28.222,"I hit it. Yes, I hit it!"
00:06:28.263,00:06:30.389,- Did anybody see that?
00:06:31.558,00:06:32.851,Except for you.
00:06:37.939,00:06:41.318,let them escape!
00:06:59.920,00:07:01.338,You're all out.
00:07:07.844,00:07:10.430,one more thing you need to know.
00:07:20.565,00:07:22.984,"- Sorry, Dad."
00:07:32.411,00:07:34.871,"OK, but I hit a Night Fury. Aah!"
00:07:34.913,00:07:37.040,"It's not like the last few times, Dad!"
00:07:37.082,00:07:38.875,"I really, actually hit it!"
00:07:38.917,00:07:41.586,You guys were busy.
00:07:41.628,00:07:44.881,It went down off Raven Point.
00:07:44.923,00:07:48.635,Stop! Just stop.
00:07:48.676,00:07:51.930,"Every time you step outside, disaster follows."
00:07:51.972,00:07:54.266,Can you not see that I have bigger problems?
00:07:54.308,00:07:57.477,Winter is almost here and I have an entire village to feed!
00:07:59.229,00:08:03.024,"Between you and me, the village could do with a little less feeding."
00:08:03.066,00:08:05.068,"This isn't a joke, Hiccup!"
00:08:05.110,00:08:08.696,follow the simplest orders?
00:08:08.738,00:08:13.410,I can't stop myself.
00:08:13.452,00:08:15.454,"It's who I am, Dad."
00:08:15.495,00:08:18.123,"Oh, you're many things, Hiccup."
00:08:18.165,00:08:21.042,But a dragon killer is not one of them.
00:08:21.084,00:08:22.127,Get back to the house.
00:08:22.961,00:08:24.212,Make sure he gets there.
00:08:25.339,00:08:27.841,I have his mess to clean up.
00:08:27.882,00:08:30.218,- Quite the performance.
00:08:30.260,00:08:32.262,I've never seen anyone mess up that badly.
00:08:32.304,00:08:34.681,"Thank you, thank you."
00:08:39.560,00:08:41.688,- I really did hit one.
00:08:41.729,00:08:43.690,- He never listens.
00:08:43.731,00:08:49.070,"When he does, it's with this disappointed scowl, like someone skimped on meat in his sandwich."
00:08:49.112,00:08:50.780,"Excuse me, barmaid."
00:08:50.822,00:08:53.658,I'm afraid you brought me the wrong offspring.
00:08:53.700,00:08:58.538,"I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy arms, extra guts and glory on the side."
00:08:58.579,00:09:01.375,"This here, this is a talking fishbone."
00:09:01.416,00:09:03.584,You're thinking about this wrong.
00:09:03.626,00:09:07.755,"It's not so much what you look like, it's what's inside that he can't stand."
00:09:09.090,00:09:11.092,Thank you for summing that up.
00:09:11.134,00:09:15.096,"Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to be something you're not."
00:09:15.138,00:09:16.764,I just want to be one of you guys.
00:09:27.401,00:09:30.737,or they'll finish us!
00:09:30.778,00:09:33.323,It's the only way we'll be rid of them.
00:09:33.365,00:09:38.828,"If we find the nest and destroy it, the dragons will leave."
00:09:38.870,00:09:41.415,One more search before the ice sets in.
00:09:41.456,00:09:43.750,Those ships never come back.
00:09:43.791,00:09:48.171,We're Vikings. It's an occupational hazard.
00:09:50.048,00:09:51.758,- Today's no good for me.
00:09:51.799,00:09:55.011,All right. Those who stay will look after Hiccup.
00:09:56.430,00:09:57.722,Aye.
00:09:59.099,00:10:01.518,Right.
00:10:01.560,00:10:04.438,"No, I need you to stay and train some new recruits."
00:10:04.479,00:10:09.025,"Perfect. And, while I'm busy, Hiccup can cover the stall."
00:10:09.067,00:10:12.529,"Molten steel, razor-sharp blades, lots of time to himself."
00:10:12.571,00:10:14.739,What could possibly go wrong?
00:10:14.781,00:10:17.033,"to do with him, Gobber?"
00:10:17.075,00:10:18.368,Put him in training.
00:10:18.410,00:10:20.828,"- No, I'm serious."
00:10:20.870,00:10:23.664,He'd be killed before the first dragon is out of its cage.
00:10:23.706,00:10:25.333,- You don't know that.
00:10:25.375,00:10:27.001,"- No, you don't."
00:10:27.043,00:10:28.420,"No, you don't."
00:10:28.462,00:10:30.380,"Listen, you know what he's like."
00:10:30.422,00:10:34.551,"From the time he could crawl, he's been... different."
00:10:36.219,00:10:39.389,He has the attention span of a sparrow.
00:10:39.431,00:10:42.850,I take him fishing and he goes hunting for trolls!
00:10:42.892,00:10:45.728,Trolls exist.
00:10:45.770,00:10:48.648,But only the left ones.
00:10:48.689,00:10:50.191,- When I was a boy...
00:10:50.233,00:10:53.320,...my father told me to bang my head against a rock and I did it.
00:10:53.361,00:10:56.030,"I thought it was crazy, but I didn't question him."
00:10:56.072,00:10:58.283,- And you know what happened?
00:10:58.325,00:11:00.994,That rock split in two.
00:11:01.035,00:11:03.871,"It taught me what a Viking could do, Gobber."
00:11:03.913,00:11:08.001,"He could crush mountains, level forests, tame seas!"
00:11:09.169,00:11:13.006,"Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become."
00:11:13.923,00:11:15.716,Hiccup is not that boy.
00:11:15.758,00:11:18.303,"You can't stop him, Stoick."
00:11:18.345,00:11:21.181,You can only prepare him.
00:11:21.222,00:11:25.268,"I know it seems hopeless, but you won't always be around to protect him."
00:11:25.310,00:11:28.687,He's going to get out there again.
00:11:46.540,00:11:49.917,"Oh, the gods hate me."
00:11:49.959,00:11:52.587,Some people lose their knife or their mug. Not me.
00:11:52.629,00:11:55.632,I manage to lose an entire dragon.
00:11:56.757,00:11:58.176,Ow!
00:12:45.306,00:12:47.892,"Oh, wow. I did it."
00:12:47.934,00:12:51.854,"Ohh, I did it. This..."
00:12:51.896,00:12:54.232,I have brought down this mighty beast!
00:13:22.885,00:13:25.138,"to kill you, dragon."
00:13:25.179,00:13:29.434,Then I'll cut out your heart and take it to my father.
00:13:29.476,00:13:32.687,I am a Viking.
00:14:06.346,00:14:08.807,I did this.
00:15:23.130,00:15:24.298,Hiccup.
00:15:24.340,00:15:26.509,"Dad, uh..."
00:15:26.551,00:15:28.261,"...I have to talk to you, Dad."
00:15:28.302,00:15:30.555,"I need to speak with you, too, son."
00:15:32.473,00:15:34.100,I don't want to fight dragons.
00:15:34.141,00:15:35.602,It's time you learn to fight dragons.
00:15:35.643,00:15:37.270,"Uh, you go first."
00:15:37.311,00:15:38.605,"No, you go first."
00:15:40.565,00:15:41.982,You get your wish.
00:15:42.024,00:15:44.736,Dragon training...
00:15:44.778,00:15:46.654,"Oh, man, I should have gone first. Uh..."
00:15:46.696,00:15:56.623,"I was thinking, you know, we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough bread-making Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?"
00:15:56.664,00:15:57.916,- You'll need this.
00:15:57.957,00:16:00.334,I don't want to fight dragons.
00:16:00.376,00:16:01.920,"Yes, you do."
00:16:01.961,00:16:05.757,Rephrase.
00:16:05.799,00:16:07.842,But you will kill dragons.
00:16:07.884,00:16:10.970,"No, I'm really very extra-sure that I won't."
00:16:11.011,00:16:12.972,"- It's time, Hiccup."
00:16:13.013,00:16:15.308,"This is serious, son."
00:16:15.349,00:16:20.229,"When you carry this axe, you carry all of us with you."
00:16:20.271,00:16:24.567,"Which means you walk like us, you talk like us..."
00:16:24.609,00:16:26.611,...you think like us.
00:16:26.653,00:16:28.905,No more of... this.
00:16:28.947,00:16:31.198,You just gestured to all of me.
00:16:31.240,00:16:34.410,- Deal?
00:16:34.452,00:16:35.703,Deal?
00:16:40.291,00:16:41.417,Good.
00:16:42.627,00:16:44.754,Train hard.
00:16:44.796,00:16:47.465,I'll be back. Probably.
00:16:47.507,00:16:50.259,And I'll be here.
00:16:50.301,00:16:51.845,Maybe.
00:16:53.513,00:16:55.097,Welcome to dragon training!
00:16:55.890,00:16:57.558,No turning back.
00:17:14.993,00:17:17.244,I hope I get some serious burns.
00:17:17.286,00:17:20.581,"I'm hoping for some mauling, like on my shoulder or back."
00:17:20.623,00:17:23.001,"Yeah, it's only fun if you get a scar out of it."
00:17:23.042,00:17:24.544,"no kidding, right?"
00:17:24.585,00:17:26.796,Pain. Love it.
00:17:26.838,00:17:28.631,"Oh, great."
00:17:28.673,00:17:31.509,Let's get started!
00:17:28.673,00:17:36.305,The recruit who does best will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire village.
00:17:36.347,00:17:40.601,"Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so does that disqualify him?"
00:17:40.643,00:17:43.312,Can I transfer to the class with the cool Vikings?
00:17:43.354,00:17:45.940,Don't worry.
00:17:45.982,00:17:47.901,that'll make you less of a target.
00:17:47.942,00:17:57.994,They'll see you as sick or insane and go after the more Viking-like Behind these doors are just a few of the many species you will learn to fight!
00:17:58.036,00:18:00.663,- The Deadly Nadder!
00:18:00.705,00:18:01.956,The Hideous Zippleback.
00:18:01.998,00:18:03.541,Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.
00:18:03.583,00:18:05.835,- The Monstrous Nightmare.
00:18:05.877,00:18:08.087,- The Terrible Terror.
00:18:08.128,00:18:09.589,Can you stop that?!
00:18:09.630,00:18:12.967,And the Gronckle.
00:18:13.009,00:18:15.053,- Whoa! Whoa!
00:18:15.094,00:18:16.971,"Wait, aren't you teach us first?"
00:18:17.013,00:18:19.348,I believe in learning on the job.
00:18:21.768,00:18:24.186,Today is about survival.
00:18:25.063,00:18:26.397,...you're dead!
00:18:26.439,00:18:28.733,What's the first thing you'll need?
00:18:28.775,00:18:30.401,- A doctor?
00:18:30.443,00:18:32.862,- A shield.
00:18:32.904,00:18:35.949,Your most important piece of equipment is your shield!
00:18:35.990,00:18:40.411,"If you must choose between a sword or a shield, take the shield!"
00:18:40.453,00:18:42.455,- Let go of my shield!
00:18:42.496,00:18:45.165,Take that one.
00:18:45.207,00:18:47.126,"Oops, this one has blood on it."
00:18:48.669,00:18:50.880,You're out!
00:18:50.922,00:18:52.757,Shields are good for another thing.
00:18:52.799,00:18:57.053,Noise! Make lots of it to throw off a dragon's aim!
00:18:57.095,00:19:00.974,a limited number of shots.
00:19:01.015,00:19:03.142,How many does a Gronckle have?
00:19:03.183,00:19:05.436,- Five?
00:19:05.478,00:19:07.187,That's one for each of you!
00:19:08.314,00:19:10.024,"- Fishlegs, out!"
00:19:10.066,00:19:12.485,"- Hiccup, get in there!"
00:19:12.526,00:19:16.614,- I moved into my parents' basement.
00:19:16.656,00:19:18.574,Come by sometime and work out.
00:19:18.616,00:19:19.993,You look like you work out. Aah!
00:19:20.034,00:19:22.202,You're done!
00:19:22.244,00:19:23.955,"So it's just you and me, huh?"
00:19:23.997,00:19:25.957,"Nope, just you."
00:19:29.877,00:19:31.170,Hiccup!
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.180,And that's six.
00:19:41.221,00:19:44.183,"Go back to bed, you overgrown sausage!"
00:19:45.768,00:19:49.063,"You'll get another chance, don't you worry."
00:19:49.105,00:19:55.528,"Remember, a dragon will always, always go for the kill."
00:20:02.618,00:20:05.204,So... why didn't you?
00:20:32.523,00:20:34.233,This was stupid.
00:21:17.276,00:21:20.571,Why don't you just fly away?
00:21:56.107,00:21:59.152,go wrong in the ring today?
00:21:59.193,00:22:01.821,my somersault dive.
00:22:01.862,00:22:03.197,It threw off my reverse tumble.
00:22:04.907,00:22:06.784,"No, no, you were great."
00:22:06.826,00:22:09.870,She's right. You have to be tough on yourselves.
00:22:09.912,00:22:11.497,Where did Hiccup go wrong?
00:22:11.538,00:22:14.208,"- Uh, he showed up."
00:22:14.250,00:22:16.002,He's never where he should be.
00:22:16.043,00:22:18.296,"Thank you, Astrid."
00:22:18.337,00:22:23.050,You need to live and breathe this stuff.
00:22:23.092,00:22:27.180,Everything we know about every dragon we know of.
00:22:27.221,00:22:29.265,- Ah.
00:22:29.307,00:22:31.892,No attacks tonight.
00:22:31.934,00:22:33.894,"Wait, you mean read?"
00:22:33.936,00:22:35.353,While we're still alive?
00:22:35.395,00:22:39.275,Why read words when you can just kill the stuff the words tell you stuff about?
00:22:39.317,00:22:42.360,I've read it seven times.
00:22:39.317,00:22:45.865,There's this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And there's this other one...
00:22:45.906,00:22:47.616,Yeah.
00:22:47.658,00:22:50.911,- There was a chance I'd read it...
00:22:50.953,00:22:52.663,You guys read.
00:22:52.705,00:22:55.624,Another one has spines like trees.
00:22:55.666,00:22:58.585,- So I guess we'll share?
00:22:58.627,00:23:02.673,"Uh, all mine, then. Wow."
00:23:02.715,00:23:05.176,- ...tomorrow.
00:23:15.102,00:23:16.603,Dragon classifications.
00:23:16.645,00:23:20.440,Strike class.
00:23:20.482,00:23:22.235,- Thunderdrum.
00:23:22.276,00:23:26.113,This reclusive dragon inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.
00:23:26.155,00:23:31.160,"When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a concussive sound that can kill a man at close range."
00:23:31.202,00:23:34.038,Extremely dangerous.
00:23:34.080,00:23:38.376,Timberjack.
00:23:34.080,00:23:40.336,This gigantic creature has razor-sharp wings that can slice through full-grown trees.
00:23:40.378,00:23:43.421,Extremely dangerous.
00:23:43.463,00:23:47.093,Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its victim.
00:23:47.134,00:23:48.677,Extremely dangerous.
00:23:53.891,00:23:58.562,Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.
00:23:58.604,00:24:02.440,Gronckle. Zippleback.
00:24:02.482,00:24:06.320,Bone Knapper.
00:24:07.571,00:24:09.323,Burns its victims.
00:24:09.365,00:24:12.492,Chokes its victims.
00:24:12.534,00:24:15.579,Extremely dangerous.
00:24:15.621,00:24:19.457,Kill on sight.
00:24:20.918,00:24:23.212,Night Fury.
00:24:23.254,00:24:27.216,Speed unknown.
00:24:27.258,00:24:31.178,The unholy offspring of lightning and death itself.
00:24:31.220,00:24:33.139,Never engage this dragon.
00:24:33.180,00:24:37.351,Your only chance: hide and pray it does not find you.
00:24:50.614,00:24:53.491,smell them.
00:24:53.533,00:24:55.119,They're close.
00:24:55.869,00:24:57.495,Steady.
00:25:08.090,00:25:09.633,Take us in.
00:25:09.675,00:25:12.886,Hard to port.
00:25:32.072,00:25:36.869,"Hey, you know, I just happened to notice the book had nothing on Night Furies."
00:25:36.910,00:25:39.330,"Is there another book, or a sequel?"
00:25:39.372,00:25:41.539,Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?
00:25:42.875,00:25:45.711,You're not even trying!
00:25:47.713,00:25:51.008,- Today it's all about attack!
00:25:51.050,00:25:53.469,Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
00:25:53.511,00:25:56.554,Your job is to be quicker and lighter!
00:25:59.016,00:26:01.352,I'm really beginning to question your teaching methods!
00:26:01.394,00:26:04.063,Look for its blind spot!
00:26:04.104,00:26:06.940,"Find it, hide in it and strike!"
00:26:08.275,00:26:10.277,Do you ever bathe?
00:26:10.319,00:26:12.696,"If you don't like it, then just get your own blind spot."
00:26:12.738,00:26:15.573,- How about I give you one?
00:26:16.867,00:26:19.870,"Blind spot, yes."
00:26:19.912,00:26:23.707,- How would one sneak up on a Night Fury?
00:26:23.749,00:26:27.253,No one's ever met one and lived to tell the tale.
00:26:27.294,00:26:29.755,"- I know, I know, but hypothetically..."
00:26:29.796,00:26:31.215,Get down.
00:26:45.062,00:26:46.604,"Watch out, babe."
00:26:48.857,00:26:51.527,"- The sun was in my eyes, Astrid."
00:26:51.569,00:26:53.611,"What do you want me to do, block the sun?"
00:26:53.653,00:26:55.531,I could do that but I don't have time!
00:26:57.783,00:27:01.495,"...take the daytime off, right? Like a cat."
00:27:01.537,00:27:03.914,Has anyone ever seen one napping?
00:27:03.956,00:27:05.623,Hiccup!
00:27:06.959,00:27:08.377,Hiccup!
00:27:10.421,00:27:12.923,Ooh! Love on the battlefield.
00:27:12.965,00:27:14.632,She could do better.
00:27:14.674,00:27:16.718,Let me... Why don't you...?
00:27:18.845,00:27:20.598,Ow! Ow! Ow!
00:27:28.564,00:27:32.067,Is this some kind of a joke to you?
00:27:32.109,00:27:35.070,Our parents' war is about to become ours.
00:27:35.112,00:27:37.030,Figure out which side you're on.
00:29:00.656,00:29:03.075,I could have sworn you had...
00:29:06.078,00:29:07.538,...teeth.
00:29:11.208,00:29:12.751,"No, no, no."
00:29:14.545,00:29:15.921,I... I don't have any more!
00:29:21.927,00:29:23.429,Ugh!
00:29:45.701,00:29:46.785,Uh...
00:29:48.787,00:29:50.830,- Mmm!
00:29:51.582,00:29:52.791,Mm-hmm.
00:33:13.992,00:33:16.620,he took my hand and swallowed it whole!
00:33:16.662,00:33:19.998,I saw the look on his face...
00:33:20.039,00:33:24.962,"He must have passed the word, because it wasn't a month before another one of them took my leg."
00:33:25.003,00:33:29.257,Isn't it weird to think your hand was inside a dragon?
00:33:29.299,00:33:35.180,"Like if your mind was still in control of it, you could have killed the dragon from inside by crushing his heart."
00:33:35.221,00:33:40.393,"I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot."
00:33:40.435,00:33:44.189,"I'll chop off the legs of every dragon I fight, with my face."
00:33:45.899,00:33:48.026,It's the wings and tail you really want.
00:33:48.067,00:33:50.570,"If it can't fly, it can't get away."
00:33:50.612,00:33:53.156,A downed dragon is a dead dragon.
00:33:56.785,00:34:00.079,"All right, I'm off to bed."
00:34:00.121,00:34:06.795,"Tomorrow we get to the big boys, slowly but surely making our way up to the Monstrous Nightmare."
00:34:06.837,00:34:09.088,But who'll win the honor of killing it?
00:34:09.130,00:34:12.258,It's gonna be me.
00:34:12.300,00:34:15.053,let you get a tattoo?
00:34:15.094,00:34:16.722,it's a birthmark.
00:34:16.763,00:34:21.059,"with you since birth, and that was never there before."
00:34:21.100,00:34:23.979,You've just never seen me from the left side.
00:35:07.355,00:35:11.109,I brought breakfast. I hope...
00:35:12.027,00:35:14.320,"OK, that's disgusting."
00:35:14.362,00:35:17.824,"We've got some salmon, some nice Icelandic cod..."
00:35:17.866,00:35:19.743,...and a whole smoked eel.
00:35:24.748,00:35:29.086,"- No, no, no, no, no! It's OK."
00:35:29.127,00:35:31.421,"Yeah, I don't really like eel much, either."
00:35:34.883,00:35:37.052,That's it.
00:35:37.094,00:35:39.721,That's it. Just stick with the good stuff.
00:35:39.763,00:35:43.141,And don't you mind me.
00:35:39.763,00:35:46.352,"I'll just be back here, minding my own business."
00:35:58.448,00:35:59.783,It's OK.
00:36:10.293,00:36:11.461,OK.
00:36:25.976,00:36:27.185,That's not too bad. It works.
00:36:28.645,00:36:32.107,Whoa! Whooaa!
00:36:32.149,00:36:34.985,"No, no, no, no!"
00:36:38.321,00:36:40.157,Whoa!
00:36:45.078,00:36:47.205,"Oh, my...! It's working!"
00:36:53.294,00:36:55.380,"Yes, yes! I did it!"
00:36:57.507,00:36:59.885,Aaah!
00:37:08.810,00:37:10.353,is about teamwork.
00:37:13.690,00:37:16.943,"Now, a wet dragon head can't light its fire."
00:37:16.985,00:37:21.198,The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky.
00:37:21.239,00:37:25.368,"One head breathes gas, the other head lights it."
00:37:25.410,00:37:28.705,Your job is to know which is which.
00:37:28.747,00:37:32.417,Razor-sharp serrated teeth that inject venom for pre-digestion.
00:37:32.458,00:37:34.544,"Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims..."
00:37:34.586,00:37:35.795,Will you please stop that?!
00:37:40.008,00:37:44.221,"If that dragon shows either of his faces, I'm gonna..."
00:37:44.262,00:37:45.304,There!
00:37:46.389,00:37:48.850,"Hey, it's us, idiots!"
00:37:48.892,00:37:52.062,Your butts are getting bigger.
00:37:52.104,00:37:56.315,Not that there's anything wrong with a dragonesque figure... Ow!
00:37:56.983,00:38:00.112,- Wait.
00:38:03.156,00:38:05.742,"Oh, I'm hurt!"
00:38:05.784,00:38:08.453,Chances of survival are dwindling to single digits now.
00:38:15.043,00:38:17.295,Oh. Heh! Wrong head.
00:38:17.963,00:38:19.297,Fishlegs!
00:38:26.554,00:38:28.389,"Oh, come on."
00:38:32.477,00:38:34.312,- Hiccup!
00:38:35.981,00:38:39.276,"Back, back, back!"
00:38:39.317,00:38:43.113,"Now, don't you make me tell you again!"
00:38:43.155,00:38:47.408,Back into your cage.
00:38:57.210,00:38:59.378,"OK, so are we done?"
00:38:59.420,00:39:02.841,'Cause I've got some things I need to...
00:39:02.882,00:39:05.302,"Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!"
00:39:15.020,00:39:17.438,- Hey!
00:39:57.103,00:39:59.356,I've never seen a Gronckle do that.
00:39:59.397,00:40:01.691,I left my axe back in the ring.
00:40:01.733,00:40:04.443,You guys go on ahead.
00:40:17.707,00:40:20.293,- Hyah!
00:40:43.900,00:40:46.569,the Terrible Terror.
00:40:47.904,00:40:50.531,the size of my...
00:40:52.951,00:40:57.414,"Oh, I'm hurt!"
00:40:57.455,00:41:00.583,- Wow! He's better than you ever were.
00:41:47.922,00:41:49.257,Hiccup.
00:42:04.730,00:42:07.317,Are you in there?
00:42:08.526,00:42:09.902,Astrid. Hey.
00:42:09.944,00:42:12.864,"Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid."
00:42:12.905,00:42:15.825,"I normally don't care what people do, but you're acting weird."
00:42:15.867,00:42:18.577,"- Well, weirder."
00:42:47.524,00:42:49.067,"I trust you found the nest, at least?"
00:42:49.108,00:42:50.860,Not even close.
00:42:50.902,00:42:52.529,Oh. Excellent.
00:42:52.570,00:42:54.947,I hope you had more success than me.
00:42:54.989,00:42:59.411,"If by success, you mean your parenting troubles are over, yes."
00:42:59.452,00:43:02.955,"Congratulations, Stoick!"
00:43:02.997,00:43:05.333,"Out with the old and in with the new, right?"
00:43:05.375,00:43:06.751,No one will miss that nuisance!
00:43:06.792,00:43:08.461,We're throwing a party to celebrate!
00:43:08.503,00:43:10.338,- Come over here.
00:43:10.380,00:43:12.673,He's gone?
00:43:12.715,00:43:15.718,"Yeah. Most afternoons, but who can blame him?"
00:43:15.760,00:43:17.929,The life of a celebrity is very rough.
00:43:17.970,00:43:21.724,He can barely walk through the village without being swarmed by his new fans.
00:43:21.766,00:43:23.851,- Hiccup?
00:43:23.893,00:43:26.604,He has this way with the beasts.
00:43:35.029,00:43:38.657,"OK, bud. We're gonna take this nice and slow."
00:43:38.699,00:43:41.202,Here we go. Here we go.
00:43:41.244,00:43:43.496,"...three... no, four."
00:44:02.599,00:44:04.476,"All right, it's go time."
00:44:11.190,00:44:13.192,"Come on, buddy!"
00:44:21.159,00:44:22.660,"Yes, it worked!"
00:44:26.372,00:44:28.916,- Sorry!
00:44:30.126,00:44:32.670,- It was my fault.
00:44:33.712,00:44:37.467,"Yeah, I'm on it."
00:44:40.386,00:44:42.639,"Yeah! Go, baby!"
00:44:42.930,00:44:44.223,Yes!
00:44:44.265,00:44:46.017,"Oh, this is amazing!"
00:44:46.058,00:44:48.144,The wind in my...
00:44:48.186,00:44:50.647,Stop!
00:44:52.940,00:44:55.109,- No!
00:44:57.445,00:45:01.073,"Oh, gosh!"
00:45:01.115,00:45:04.494,"All right, OK, you've gotta kind of angle yourself."
00:45:04.536,00:45:07.788,"OK, no, no, no. Come back down towards me! Come back down..."
00:45:49.038,00:45:50.747,Yeah!
00:45:52.375,00:45:53.750,"Oh, come on."
00:46:01.593,00:46:04.679,Uh...
00:46:41.006,00:46:44.176,"Huh. Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?"
00:46:44.218,00:46:45.802,Here you go.
00:47:02.320,00:47:06.532,Everything we know about you guys is wrong.
00:47:16.626,00:47:20.004,Dad! You're back!
00:47:23.508,00:47:25.092,I came looking for you.
00:47:25.134,00:47:26.552,You did?
00:47:26.594,00:47:28.095,You've been keeping secrets.
00:47:30.139,00:47:32.350,Just how long did you think you could hide it?
00:47:32.391,00:47:35.687,I... I... I don't know what you're...
00:47:35.728,00:47:39.649,Nothing happens on this island without me hearing about it.
00:47:39.691,00:47:41.734,- Oh?
00:47:42.735,00:47:44.696,...let's talk...
00:47:44.737,00:47:46.280,...about that dragon.
00:47:46.322,00:47:51.285,"Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry."
00:47:51.327,00:47:54.038,- I just didn't know how to...
00:47:58.334,00:48:00.877,You're...
00:48:00.919,00:48:03.339,What?!
00:48:03.381,00:48:05.007,Uh... You were?
00:48:05.049,00:48:07.301,"And believe me, it only gets better!"
00:48:07.343,00:48:10.137,Wait till you spill a Nadder's guts the first time!
00:48:10.179,00:48:13.140,And mount your first Gronckle head on a spear!
00:48:13.182,00:48:17.102,What a feeling!
00:48:17.144,00:48:21.858,All those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen.
00:48:21.940,00:48:24.943,"Odin, it was rough."
00:48:24.985,00:48:27.154,And all the while you were holding out on me!
00:48:30.825,00:48:33.160,With you doing so well in the ring...
00:48:34.620,00:48:37.373,...we finally have something to talk about.
00:48:49.427,00:48:50.969,Oh.
00:48:51.011,00:48:57.769,"Here, I, uh, I brought you something, to keep you safe in the ring."
00:48:57.810,00:49:00.020,Wow. Thanks.
00:49:00.062,00:49:02.690,Your mother would have wanted you to have it.
00:49:02.732,00:49:06.360,- It's half of her breastplate.
00:49:06.402,00:49:10.740,Matching set.
00:49:10.782,00:49:13.910,Wear it proudly.
00:49:13.950,00:49:15.870,You've held up your end of the deal.
00:49:20.875,00:49:23.795,really get to bed.
00:49:23.836,00:49:25.922,"Yes, good. OK, good talk."
00:49:25.962,00:49:28.048,I'll see you back at the house.
00:49:28.090,00:49:30.259,Thanks for stopping by...
00:49:30.301,00:49:33.387,- ...and for the breast hat.
00:49:35.013,00:49:37.224,"Well, uh... Yep."
00:49:52.156,00:49:54.784,Stay out of my way!
00:49:54.826,00:49:57.994,"Please, by all means."
00:50:09.674,00:50:12.008,"This time, this time for sure!"
00:50:21.393,00:50:25.105,"No! No, son of a half-troll, rat-eating, munge-bucket!"
00:50:26.482,00:50:28.901,"- So, later."
00:50:28.943,00:50:31.069,- I'm kind of late for...
00:50:31.111,00:50:33.865,"Late for what, exactly?"
00:50:33.906,00:50:36.200,Quiet down!
00:50:48.086,00:50:51.674,"You've done it, Hiccup!"
00:50:51.716,00:50:54.050,- Yeah!
00:50:55.427,00:50:56.846,That's my boy!
00:50:56.888,00:51:00.725,Yeah. Yes. I can't wait.
00:51:00.766,00:51:02.727,...leaving!
00:51:02.768,00:51:04.395,Let's pack up.
00:51:04.436,00:51:07.105,Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation.
00:51:07.690,00:51:09.107,Forever.
00:51:16.198,00:51:18.701,What are you doing here?
00:51:18.743,00:51:21.495,I want to know what's going on.
00:51:21.537,00:51:26.082,No one just gets as good as you do. Especially you.
00:51:26.124,00:51:29.211,Start talking!
00:51:29.253,00:51:31.881,- It better not involve this.
00:51:31.923,00:51:34.717,"I know this looks really bad, but you see..."
00:51:34.759,00:51:36.886,"- This is, uh... Aaah!"
00:51:38.303,00:51:40.096,You're right. You're right.
00:51:40.138,00:51:41.974,I'm through with the lies.
00:51:42.016,00:51:45.603,I've been making outfits.
00:51:45.644,00:51:48.898,It's time everyone knew.
00:51:48.940,00:51:51.859,Here we go... Ow!
00:51:51.901,00:51:56.238,That's for the lies.
00:51:59.992,00:52:04.120,"- Run, run!"
00:52:05.873,00:52:08.626,No! It's OK! It's OK.
00:52:08.667,00:52:10.126,She's a friend.
00:52:11.879,00:52:13.297,You just scared him.
00:52:13.338,00:52:16.216,- I scared him?!
00:52:16.258,00:52:18.343,- Who is him?
00:52:18.385,00:52:22.723,"Astrid, Toothless."
00:52:27.937,00:52:30.481,We're dead.
00:52:30.522,00:52:33.317,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going?"
00:52:39.615,00:52:42.326,"Oh, great Odin's ghost!"
00:52:53.462,00:52:56.048,"Hiccup, get me down from here!"
00:52:56.090,00:52:58.174,You have to give me a chance to explain.
00:52:58.216,00:53:01.012,I am not listening to anything you have to say!
00:53:01.053,00:53:04.348,Then I won't speak.
00:53:05.808,00:53:07.143,"Please, Astrid."
00:53:23.492,00:53:24.618,Now get me down.
00:53:24.660,00:53:27.245,"Toothless, down."
00:53:28.789,00:53:32.001,See? Nothing to be afraid of.
00:53:33.460,00:53:34.837,Whaaah!
00:53:34.879,00:53:36.380,Toothless!
00:53:37.715,00:53:40.634,What is wrong with you?!
00:53:40.676,00:53:43.929,usually like this.
00:53:43.971,00:53:46.222,"- Oh, no."
00:53:50.102,00:53:53.313,"Toothless, what are you doing?"
00:53:56.441,00:53:59.153,- And now the spinning.
00:53:59.195,00:54:02.238,"Thank you for nothing, you useless reptile."
00:54:03.115,00:54:06.160,"OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry."
00:54:06.202,00:54:08.244,Just get me off this thing.
00:55:54.476,00:55:58.772,"All right, I admit it."
00:55:58.814,00:56:01.817,It's amazing.
00:56:01.859,00:56:03.359,He's amazing.
00:56:05.779,00:56:08.324,So what now?
00:56:08.364,00:56:11.202,"Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow."
00:56:11.243,00:56:13.411,You know you'll have to kill...
00:56:13.453,00:56:14.788,- ...kill a dragon.
00:56:14.830,00:56:17.791,- Don't remind me.
00:56:17.833,00:56:19.501,what's happening?
00:56:21.545,00:56:24.380,- Whoa! What is it?
00:56:25.924,00:56:27.383,Get down!
00:56:44.484,00:56:46.778,- What's going on?
00:56:46.820,00:56:49.531,"- Toothless, you got to get us out of here, bud."
00:56:52.034,00:56:54.578,they're hauling in their kill.
00:56:54.619,00:56:57.373,Uh... what does that make us?
00:57:39.706,00:57:42.542,What my dad wouldn't give to find this.
00:57:59.726,00:58:02.771,It's satisfying to know all our food has been dumped down a hole.
00:58:02.813,00:58:06.191,- They're not eating any of it.
00:58:20.664,00:58:23.292,- What is that?
00:58:30.090,00:58:33.427,"All right, bud, we got to get out of here... now!"
00:58:42.144,00:58:46.648,makes sense. It's like a giant beehive.
00:58:46.690,00:58:48.608,They're the workers and that's their queen.
00:58:48.650,00:58:51.195,It controls them.
00:58:51.236,00:58:52.696,No! No.
00:58:52.737,00:58:56.700,"No, not yet."
00:58:56.741,00:58:59.744,We have to think this through carefully.
00:58:59.786,00:59:08.420,"Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons' nest, the thing we've been after since Vikings first sailed here, and you want to keep it a secret?"
00:59:08.462,00:59:11.548,To protect your pet dragon?
00:59:13.717,00:59:14.801,Yes.
00:59:22.226,00:59:24.895,OK. Then what do we do?
00:59:24.936,00:59:28.690,Just give me until tomorrow.
00:59:29.483,00:59:30.608,OK.
00:59:32.152,00:59:33.445,That's for kidnapping me.
00:59:40.369,00:59:43.121,That's for everything else.
00:59:52.256,00:59:53.757,What are you looking at?
00:59:55.175,00:59:59.471,Hiccup! Hiccup!
01:00:01.806,01:00:22.744,"Well, I can show my face If someone had told me that in a few short weeks Hiccup would go from, well, being, uh, Hiccup to placing first in dragon training, I'd have tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he'd gone mad!"
01:00:27.040,01:00:32.212,But here we are.
01:00:27.040,01:00:35.424,And no one is more surprised or more proud than I am.
01:00:35.466,01:00:39.511,"Today, my boy becomes a Viking."
01:00:39.553,01:00:42.514,"- Today, he becomes one of us!"
01:00:46.393,01:00:48.562,Be careful with that dragon.
01:00:48.604,01:00:50.564,It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
01:00:50.606,01:00:51.856,going to do?
01:00:51.898,01:00:54.734,Put an end to this.
01:00:55.986,01:01:01.741,"Astrid, if something goes wrong, just make sure they don't find Toothless."
01:01:01.783,01:01:05.745,I will. Just promise me it won't go wrong.
01:01:05.787,01:01:10.041,"It's time, Hiccup."
01:01:16.298,01:01:17.674,Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.
01:01:18.842,01:01:21.428,Hiccup! Hiccup!
01:01:32.939,01:01:35.066,"Hmm, I'd have gone for the hammer."
01:01:39.112,01:01:40.280,I'm ready.
01:02:04.513,01:02:07.474,Give it to him!
01:02:11.395,01:02:12.979,What is he doing?
01:02:15.899,01:02:18.652,"Hey, it's OK. It's OK."
01:02:26.326,01:02:27.703,I'm not one of them.
01:02:31.665,01:02:33.542,- What's he thinking?
01:02:33.584,01:02:35.835,- Stop the fight.
01:02:35.877,01:02:38.505,I need you all to see this.
01:02:39.756,01:02:41.799,They're not what we think they are.
01:02:41.841,01:02:43.968,We don't have to kill them.
01:02:45.470,01:02:47.764,"I said, stop the fight!"
01:02:49.516,01:02:51.017,- Aaah!
01:02:55.230,01:02:56.440,Out of my way!
01:02:56.481,01:02:57.774,Hiccup!
01:03:07.409,01:03:08.826,Aaah!
01:03:18.878,01:03:19.796,Hiccup!
01:03:26.303,01:03:27.845,This way!
01:03:48.158,01:03:49.701,Night Fury!
01:04:07.969,01:04:09.887,"All right, Toothless, go."
01:04:11.807,01:04:14.184,"- Go, go!"
01:04:14.225,01:04:16.853,"- Dad, he won't hurt you!"
01:04:16.894,01:04:19.981,"No, don't!"
01:04:20.774,01:04:21.858,"Toothless, stop!"
01:04:24.152,01:04:25.487,No! No!
01:04:33.829,01:04:36.540,"No, no! Please don't hurt him!"
01:04:36.581,01:04:37.874,Please don't hurt him.
01:04:44.548,01:04:46.800,Put it with the others.
01:04:49.177,01:04:52.013,I should have known.
01:04:52.055,01:04:54.098,- Dad?
01:04:54.140,01:04:58.061,I know we did.
01:04:58.102,01:05:01.773,"So everything in the ring, a trick? A lie?"
01:05:01.815,01:05:06.069,I screwed up.
01:05:06.110,01:05:10.073,"Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please, just don't hurt Toothless."
01:05:10.114,01:05:12.868,The dragon? That's what you're worried about?
01:05:12.909,01:05:14.994,Not the people you almost killed?
01:05:15.036,01:05:17.664,He was protecting me!
01:05:17.706,01:05:19.708,They've killed hundreds of us!
01:05:19.750,01:05:21.877,And we've killed thousands of them!
01:05:21.918,01:05:24.838,"They defend themselves, that's all!"
01:05:24.880,01:05:27.424,They raid us because they have to.
01:05:27.465,01:05:31.094,"If they don't bring enough food back, they're eaten themselves."
01:05:31.135,01:05:35.891,There's something else on their island.
01:05:35.932,01:05:38.393,Their island? So you've been to the nest?
01:05:38.435,01:05:40.270,- Did I say nest?
01:05:40.311,01:05:42.856,"What? No, I didn't."
01:05:42.898,01:05:47.235,Only a dragon can find the island.
01:05:47.277,01:05:50.321,"No, no, no. No, Dad."
01:05:50.363,01:05:53.491,You don't know what you're up against. It's like nothing you've ever seen.
01:05:53.533,01:05:57.537,"Dad, please. I promise you, you can't win this one!"
01:05:57.579,01:05:59.539,"No, Dad. No."
01:05:59.581,01:06:03.042,"For once in your life, would you please just listen to me?!"
01:06:06.963,01:06:10.842,You've thrown your lot in with them.
01:06:12.636,01:06:14.971,You're not my son.
01:06:17.933,01:06:19.183,Ready the ships!
01:07:14.489,01:07:16.366,Set sail!
01:07:16.407,01:07:19.035,We head for Helheim's Gate.
01:07:27.627,01:07:30.046,"Lead us home, devil."
01:07:50.859,01:07:52.109,It's a mess.
01:07:53.611,01:07:57.073,You must feel horrible.
01:07:53.611,01:08:00.035,"You've lost everything: your father, your tribe, your best friend."
01:08:00.076,01:08:02.245,Thank you for summing that up.
01:08:03.830,01:08:07.458,Why couldn't I have killed that dragon when I found him in the woods?
01:08:07.500,01:08:09.460,Would have been better for everyone.
01:08:09.502,01:08:12.088,Yep. The rest of us would've done it.
01:08:12.881,01:08:15.008,So why didn't you?
01:08:17.594,01:08:18.636,Why didn't you?
01:08:18.678,01:08:20.680,I don't know.
01:08:20.722,01:08:22.849,- I couldn't.
01:08:22.891,01:08:25.518,Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?
01:08:25.560,01:08:28.897,Because I want to remember what you say right now.
01:08:28.939,01:08:31.148,"Oh, for the love of..."
01:08:31.190,01:08:34.611,I was weak.
01:08:34.652,01:08:37.989,- You said wouldn't that time.
01:08:38.031,01:08:42.118,"Three hundred years, and I'm the first Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon."
01:08:46.581,01:08:48.374,"First to ride one, though."
01:08:50.752,01:08:52.087,So...?
01:08:54.798,01:08:58.134,I wouldn't kill him because he looked as frightened as I was.
01:08:59.343,01:09:02.931,I looked at him and I saw myself.
01:09:04.933,01:09:07.268,I bet he's really frightened now.
01:09:07.310,01:09:09.186,What are you going to do about it?
01:09:10.229,01:09:13.357,"Eh, probably something stupid."
01:09:13.399,01:09:15.318,"Good, but you've already done that."
01:09:16.778,01:09:19.072,Then something crazy.
01:09:19.739,01:09:22.158,That's more like it.
01:09:30.458,01:09:33.461,Stay within earshot.
01:09:33.503,01:09:36.881,to your stern.
01:09:36.923,01:09:45.598,"Stoick, I was overhearing some of the men just now, and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we're up to here."
01:09:45.640,01:09:53.898,"I know you're always the man with the plan. But some, not me, are wondering if there is, in fact, a plan at all and what it might be."
01:09:53.940,01:09:55.608,Find the nest and take it.
01:09:55.650,01:09:57.944,"Oh, of course."
01:09:57.986,01:09:59.821,The old Viking fallback.
01:09:59.863,01:10:01.447,"- Shh, shh!"
01:10:09.664,01:10:11.457,Step aside.
01:10:24.679,01:10:26.181,Bear to port.
01:10:30.810,01:10:36.107,"If you're planning on getting eaten, I'd definitely go with the Gronckle."
01:10:36.149,01:10:40.111,You were wise to seek help from the world's most deadly weapon.
01:10:40.153,01:10:41.779,- Uh...
01:10:41.821,01:10:44.240,- I love this plan.
01:10:44.281,01:10:46.993,You're crazy.
01:10:47.744,01:10:50.246,"So, what is the plan?"
01:10:59.839,01:11:03.259,- That's not really encouraging.
01:11:03.300,01:11:06.387,where that went.
01:11:17.023,01:11:21.277,- Stay low and ready your weapons.
01:11:37.085,01:11:38.586,We're here.
01:11:52.850,01:11:55.979,- Oh...
01:12:02.610,01:12:04.237,Uh-uh.
01:12:11.619,01:12:14.038,- Wait! What are you...?
01:12:14.080,01:12:16.415,It's OK. It's OK.
01:12:27.677,01:12:29.262,Where are you going?
01:12:29.304,01:12:31.639,You're gonna need something to help you hold on.
01:12:41.232,01:12:45.361,"When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose."
01:12:45.402,01:12:48.281,In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.
01:12:48.323,01:12:51.201,"No matter how this ends, it ends today."
01:13:46.505,01:13:48.424,Is that it?
01:14:03.480,01:14:07.110,This isn't over!
01:14:20.164,01:14:22.417,- Get clear!
01:14:31.592,01:14:34.470,Beard of Thor!
01:14:38.308,01:14:40.184,Odin help us.
01:14:45.189,01:14:47.483,- Catapults!
01:14:55.532,01:14:58.494,- Get to the ships!
01:15:11.299,01:15:13.301,"- Smart, that one."
01:15:13.343,01:15:15.303,Lead the men to the far side of the island!
01:15:15.345,01:15:17.096,- Right!
01:15:17.138,01:15:19.807,"I think I'll stay, in case your thinking doing something crazy."
01:15:19.849,01:15:23.227,I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to hunt!
01:15:23.269,01:15:25.104,Then I can double that time.
01:15:27.357,01:15:28.649,Here!
01:15:28.691,01:15:30.818,"Oh, no! Here!"
01:15:39.494,01:15:44.081,- Come on! Fight me!
01:15:44.123,01:15:46.501,"- No, me!"
01:15:52.756,01:15:55.009,"Ruff, Tuff!"
01:15:55.051,01:15:57.345,"Move, Fishlegs!"
01:15:57.387,01:16:01.557,We're on a dragon.
01:16:03.351,01:16:05.269,Let's move it!
01:16:05.311,01:16:10.566,Every bit the boar-headed stubborn Viking you ever were!
01:16:11.567,01:16:14.070,"- Fishlegs, break it down!"
01:16:14.111,01:16:16.406,Heavily armored skull and tail made for bashing and crushing!
01:16:16.447,01:16:18.282,Steer clear of both.
01:16:18.324,01:16:21.411,"Small eyes, large nostrils!"
01:16:21.452,01:16:25.039,"OK, Lout, Legs! Hang in its blind spot, make noise, keep it confused!"
01:16:25.081,01:16:28.418,"Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot limit!"
01:16:28.459,01:16:30.002,That's my specialty!
01:16:30.044,01:16:33.464,Since when?! Everyone knows I'm more irritating! See?
01:16:33.506,01:16:36.926,Just do what I told you!
01:16:36.967,01:16:38.635,We got it covered!
01:16:48.354,01:16:49.897,- Troll!
01:16:49.939,01:16:51.857,- Bride of Grendel!
01:16:57.363,01:16:59.949,"Um, this thing doesn't have a blind spot!"
01:17:02.618,01:17:03.619,There!
01:17:11.961,01:17:13.337,Go help the others!
01:17:15.089,01:17:16.632,"OK, hold on. Hold on."
01:17:20.386,01:17:22.805,- It's working!
01:17:29.270,01:17:30.646,Whoa!
01:17:32.398,01:17:35.776,"I've lost power on the Gronckle! Snotlout, do something!"
01:17:38.946,01:17:41.073,- I'm OK!
01:17:45.161,01:17:48.623,I can't miss!
01:17:53.127,01:17:54.670,Yeah! You're the Viking!
01:17:57.340,01:17:59.049,Aaah!
01:17:59.091,01:18:01.677,Hey! Whoa!
01:18:32.208,01:18:33.709,Dad?
01:18:52.186,01:18:53.729,"You got it, bud."
01:19:00.069,01:19:02.863,I'm sorry...
01:19:03.406,01:19:04.990,"Yeah. Me, too."
01:19:05.032,01:19:06.992,You don't have to go up there.
01:19:07.034,01:19:11.080,We're Vikings.
01:19:12.498,01:19:14.750,I'm proud to call you my son.
01:19:16.544,01:19:17.753,"Thanks, Dad."
01:19:22.966,01:19:25.344,- He's up!
01:19:28.097,01:19:29.515,Get Snotlout out of there.
01:19:29.557,01:19:31.225,- I'm on it!
01:19:31.267,01:19:32.768,"Hey, let me drive!"
01:19:34.270,01:19:36.772,- Don't push me!
01:19:40.359,01:19:42.319,believe that worked!
01:19:49.577,01:19:51.078,- Night Fury!
01:19:51.120,01:19:52.913,Get down!
01:20:02.881,01:20:04.007,Did you get her?
01:20:14.143,01:20:15.394,Go.
01:20:15.436,01:20:17.020,That thing has wings.
01:20:17.062,01:20:19.898,"OK, let's see if it can use them!"
01:20:35.706,01:20:37.833,You think that did it?
01:20:42.588,01:20:44.799,"Well, he can fly."
01:20:56.852,01:20:57.853,- Go!
01:21:04.943,01:21:07.655,"OK, Toothless, time to disappear."
01:21:08.322,01:21:09.782,"Come on, bud!"
01:21:15.120,01:21:17.414,- Here it comes!
01:21:56.662,01:21:58.539,- Ooh!
01:22:09.341,01:22:10.926,Watch out!
01:22:13.387,01:22:15.681,"OK, time's up!"
01:22:18.100,01:22:20.477,Come on! Is that the best you can do?!
01:22:38.245,01:22:40.748,"Stay with me, buddy."
01:22:44.919,01:22:46.962,"- Hold, Toothless."
01:22:47.296,01:22:48.964,Now!
01:23:12.613,01:23:13.697,No.
01:23:13.739,01:23:15.950,- No! Uhh!
01:23:31.423,01:23:33.008,Hiccup!
01:23:34.134,01:23:35.803,Hiccup!
01:23:36.637,01:23:38.096,Son!
01:24:04.247,01:24:05.916,"Oh, son."
01:24:07.209,01:24:08.961,I did this.
01:24:38.699,01:24:42.036,"Oh, son, I'm so sorry."
01:24:48.458,01:24:49.710,Hiccup!
01:24:55.591,01:24:59.511,You brought him back alive.
01:25:07.895,01:25:10.731,- Ooh!
01:25:16.236,01:25:19.865,Thank you for saving my son.
01:25:19.907,01:25:23.118,"Well, you know..."
01:25:41.553,01:25:43.179,"Hey, Toothless."
01:25:43.221,01:25:46.349,"I'm happy to see you, too, buddy."
01:25:49.519,01:25:52.022,I'm in my house.
01:25:52.064,01:25:54.566,"- Uh, you're in my house."
01:25:54.608,01:25:57.069,Does my dad know you're here? Uh...
01:25:57.111,01:25:59.404,"What? Oh, OK, OK."
01:25:59.446,01:26:01.490,"Toothless, no."
01:26:01.531,01:26:04.159,"Toothless! Oh, come on."
01:26:38.777,01:26:40.320,- Aah!
01:26:42.656,01:26:45.200,"OK. Thanks, bud."
01:26:53.125,01:26:55.627,- Aaah!
01:26:55.669,01:26:57.963,"Toothless, stay here."
01:26:58.005,01:26:59.214,Get ready!
01:26:59.255,01:27:01.091,Hold on tight! Here we go!
01:27:03.510,01:27:05.220,What?
01:27:13.311,01:27:16.398,- I knew it. I'm dead.
01:27:16.439,01:27:20.986,"No, but you gave it your best shot."
01:27:21.028,01:27:22.863,it's Hiccup!
01:27:26.867,01:27:31.038,Turns out all we needed was a little more of this.
01:27:31.080,01:27:33.165,You just gestured to all of me.
01:27:34.499,01:27:37.669,"Well, most of you."
01:27:37.711,01:27:41.215,With a little Hiccup flair thrown in. You think it'll do?
01:27:41.256,01:27:43.800,- I might make a few tweaks.
01:27:45.510,01:27:47.429,- Aah!
01:27:47.470,01:27:49.723,"What, is it always going to be this way? 'Cause..."
01:27:52.350,01:27:54.269,...I could get used to it.
01:27:57.397,01:27:59.191,- Welcome home.
01:27:59.233,01:28:01.526,- Get down!
01:28:11.995,01:28:14.998,- You ready?
01:28:18.210,01:28:22.505,It snows nine months of the year and hails the other three.
01:28:24.549,01:28:27.510,Any food that grows here is tough and tasteless.
01:28:29.429,01:28:32.515,The people that grow here are even more so.
01:28:34.601,01:28:36.019,Yeah!
01:28:36.061,01:28:38.855,are the pets.
01:28:41.108,01:28:45.320,While other places have ponies or parrots...
01:28:46.738,01:28:48.323,...we have...
01:28:48.907,01:28:50.617,...dragons.
