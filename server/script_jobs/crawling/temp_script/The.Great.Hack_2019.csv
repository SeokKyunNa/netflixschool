00:01:09.652,00:01:11.321,Didn't that make you uncomfortable at all?
00:01:17.911,00:01:20.497,You referred to having two sets of business cards.
00:01:21.915,00:01:23.291,Who did you work for?
00:01:40.225,00:01:41.643,Don't take this the wrong way.
00:01:42.936,00:01:49.651,"In your life, have you ever worked for or provided information to any country's intelligence agency?"
00:09:42.248,00:09:48.087,I've been looking at Cambridge Analytica for over a year and I think there's more to be found.
00:10:54.528,00:11:02.912,"I think the beauty of David's case is that it encapsulates why data rights should be considered just fundamental rights, simple rights."
00:11:02.995,00:11:06.540,Because all he wants to know is what did you do?
00:11:08.167,00:11:23.891,"And if David finds out the data beneath his profile, you'll start to be able to connect the dots in various ways with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and Trump and Brexit and all these loosely connected entities."
00:11:24.517,00:11:28.604,"Because you get to see inside the beast, you get to see inside the system."
00:26:49.357,00:26:56.364,Have you or anybody else made any assessment of actually whether any of this made much difference to the final outcome of the EU Referendum?
00:34:21.768,00:34:24.520,Tell us about the first meeting you had in Trump Tower.
00:34:25.313,00:34:34.238,"In November 2015, I went with Alexander Nix to go see Corey Lewandowski, who was the campaign manager at the time."
00:34:34.697,00:34:38.951,"And I asked Corey, why could this place possibly look so familiar?"
00:34:39.285,00:34:42.413,"And he said, This is the set of The Apprentice."
00:34:42.955,00:34:45.208,That's probably why you recognize it. And...
00:34:45.666,00:34:47.543,"I was kind of shocked, you know?"
00:34:48.294,00:34:52.173,The Trump campaign HQ is a reality TV set.
00:34:52.256,00:34:54.383,Yes. It is.
00:36:18.134,00:36:19.010,No.
00:44:19.615,00:44:21.075,You didn't? Or you did?
00:48:00.168,00:48:06.258,"Well, I just want you to mentally be okay with this, 'cause what you're doing is a monumental undertaking."
00:48:07.009,00:48:08.635,And I still fear for your life.
00:48:09.386,00:48:11.597,With the powerful people that are involved too.
00:48:13.891,00:48:15.976,You just have to be careful all the time.
00:48:20.147,00:48:22.691,"I know, I know."
00:48:23.901,00:48:26.111,"I totally get that, you know."
00:48:26.987,00:48:31.074,Somebody's always got to bring down these jerks.
00:48:32.451,00:48:34.953,"So, you know, anyway."
00:48:35.329,00:48:40.667,"When I have time off next month, I've gotta go and put deposits down on electric and gas."
00:48:41.293,00:48:44.463,"I don't have $1,000 right now, so I'll have to wait."
00:48:47.466,00:48:49.885,"Oh, don't worry, I don't need it right now."
00:48:51.887,00:48:53.972,"All right, honey, you stay healthy."
00:48:54.139,00:48:55.682,"Be safe, honey. I love you."
00:48:56.183,00:48:57.643,"Bye bye, baby."
00:57:40.123,00:57:41.458,And what about Brittany?
01:01:04.327,01:01:06.788,We are a behavior change agency.
01:01:08.039,01:01:13.211,The holy grail of communications is when you can start to change behavior.
01:01:15.755,01:01:20.385,"Trinidad. This is a great, interesting case history of how we look at problems."
01:01:23.846,01:01:27.642,"There are two main political parties, one for the blacks and one for the Indians."
01:01:28.309,01:01:30.353,"And you know, they screw each other."
01:01:30.436,01:01:33.189,"So, we were working for the Indians."
01:01:34.399,01:01:37.985,"We went to the client and we said, We want to target the youth."
01:01:38.319,01:01:42.365,And we try and increase apathy.
01:01:44.325,01:01:47.704,"The campaign had to be non-political, because the kids don't care about politics."
01:01:47.787,01:01:50.748,"It had to be reactive, because they're lazy."
01:01:51.708,01:01:57.171,"So we came up with this campaign, which was all about: Be part of the gang. Do something cool."
01:01:57.255,01:01:58.423,Be part of a movement.
01:01:58.923,01:02:00.967,And it was called the Do So! campaign.
01:02:01.676,01:02:02.969,It means I'm not going to vote.
01:02:03.052,01:02:04.887,Do so! Don't vote.
01:02:18.818,01:02:24.490,"It's a sign of resistance against, not the government, against politics and voting."
01:02:28.786,01:02:31.164,They're making their own YouTube videos.
01:02:31.247,01:02:34.667,This is the Prime Minister's house that's being graffiti'd.
01:02:34.751,01:02:36.502,It was carnage.
01:02:38.296,01:02:45.261,"We knew that when it came to voting, all the Afro-Caribbean kids wouldn't vote, because they Do So!"
01:02:45.344,01:02:50.808,"But all the Indian kids would do what their parents told them to do, which is go out and vote."
01:02:51.434,01:02:56.397,"They had a lot of fun doing this, but they're not gonna go against their parents' will."
01:03:00.610,01:03:05.072,Thank God for the guidance that has brought us here to this victory.
01:03:05.156,01:03:07.492,"Thank you. Thank you, God."
01:03:07.575,01:03:12.663,And the difference in 18 to 35 year old turnout was like 40%.
01:03:13.623,01:03:19.253,"And that swung the election about 6%, which was all we needed in an election that's very close."
01:03:22.507,01:03:28.179,We now undertake ten national campaigns for prime minister or president each year.
01:03:28.971,01:03:30.389,Malaysia we're working in.
01:03:31.057,01:03:34.602,"We did Lithuania, Romania, Kenya, Ghana."
01:03:35.353,01:03:37.104,-So quite a few this year. -Nigeria.
01:03:37.730,01:03:40.650,"-The Brexit campaign? -Oh, and the Brexit campaign, yeah."
01:03:41.442,01:03:42.902,But we don't talk about that.
01:03:42.985,01:03:44.278,"Oops, we won!"
01:08:31.065,01:08:41.367,He's now not able to give evidence to the Committee tomorrow as a consequence of him having been served with an information notice and being subject to the criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office.
01:08:41.450,01:08:46.413,And I hope we'll be able to update people about that early next week. Thank you very much.
01:09:20.447,01:09:21.615,What did he say?
01:09:38.340,01:09:42.261,He spent three and a half years being nice to you to get you to do what he wanted you to do.
01:09:49.935,01:09:52.354,"Hey, what's up? What did you think?"
01:10:07.995,01:10:09.038,That's right.
01:12:57.498,01:13:00.417,We have a fairly substantial defense business.
01:13:01.835,01:13:05.464,"We actually train the British Army, the British Navy, the U.S. Army, U.S. Special Forces."
01:13:05.547,01:13:09.009,"We train NATO, the CIA, State Department, Pentagon."
01:13:09.676,01:13:15.057,It's using research to influence behavior of hostile audiences.
01:13:15.849,01:13:22.356,"You know, how do you persuade 14 to 30 year old Muslim boys not to join Al-Qaeda?"
01:13:23.440,01:13:25.484,Essentially communication warfare.
01:13:44.211,01:13:47.714,"There's a lot of overlap, because it's all the same methodology."
01:25:09.437,01:25:12.107,One of the things that I was really struck by was...
01:25:13.191,01:25:17.529,what happened with you and the Obama people and the Hillary people.
01:25:19.864,01:25:22.325,None of them ever wanted to offer to pay me.
01:28:02.527,01:28:09.450,"You did pitch to work on the Referendum, and I don't want to dwell on Leave.EU because you've made your position clear."
01:30:35.096,01:30:46.566,"From where I'm sitting, since you've come here today, you have attempted to paint yourself as the victim here, though, by no stretch of the imagination can you be seen as a victim."
01:30:46.649,01:30:49.986,"Surely you can see that, you are not the victim here."
01:31:47.585,01:31:49.504,So you are the victim in all of this.
01:41:05.976,01:41:10.105,"We did Lithuania, Romania, Kenya, Ghana."
01:41:10.689,01:41:12.816,"Oh, and the Brexit campaign, yeah."
01:41:13.400,01:41:14.735,But we don't talk about that.
01:41:14.818,01:41:16.070,"Oops, we won!"
00:01:00.185,00:01:06.483,from an idealistic intern in Barack Obama's campaign to working for an organization that keeps pretty unsavory company.
00:01:09.611,00:01:11.279,Didn't that make you uncomfortable at all?
00:01:21.873,00:01:23.083,Who did you work for?
00:01:42.936,00:01:49.567,"In your life, have you ever worked for or provided information to any country's intelligence agency?"
00:02:05.959,00:02:07.418,"-Uh, $2.25. -Great."
00:02:13.716,00:02:14.717,All right.
00:02:21.808,00:02:27.480,that has convinced you that your microphone is listening to your conversations?
00:02:35.113,00:02:41.119,but what's happening is that your behavior is being accurately predicted.
00:02:41.452,00:02:55.967,"So, the ads that seem uncannily accurate, that have to be eavesdropping on us, are more likely to be evidence that the targeting works, and that it predicts our behavior."
00:02:56.801,00:03:00.930,Maybe it's because I grew up with the Internet as a reality.
00:03:01.014,00:03:04.267,The ads don't bother me all that much.
00:03:04.517,00:03:06.895,When does it turn sour?
00:03:38.468,00:03:43.973,A space where everyone could share each other's experiences and feel less alone.
00:03:46.142,00:03:58.863,"It wasn't long before this world became our matchmaker, instant fact-checker, personal entertainer, guardian of our memories, even our therapist."
00:04:05.495,00:04:10.333,"So, I knew that the data from our online activity wasn't just evaporating."
00:04:12.877,00:04:15.546,"And as I dug deeper, I realized..."
00:04:18.258,00:04:25.556,these digital traces of ourselves are being mined into a trillion-dollar-a-year industry.
00:04:29.519,00:04:31.646,We are now the commodity.
00:04:33.523,00:04:38.111,But we were so in love with the gift of this free connectivity...
00:04:39.153,00:04:42.490,that no one bothered to read the terms and conditions.
00:04:59.757,00:05:17.817,"my credit card swipes, web searches, locations, my likes, they're all collected in real time and attached to my identity, giving any buyer direct access to my emotional pulse."
00:05:21.779,00:05:33.624,"Armed with this knowledge, they compete for my attention, feeding me a steady stream of content built for and seen only by me."
00:05:37.920,00:05:41.132,And this is true for each and every one of us.
00:05:43.801,00:05:55.813,"What I like, what I fear, what gets my attention, what my boundaries are, and what it takes to cross them."
00:06:04.030,00:06:06.699,"The stock market's gonna crash. I mean, this'll cause a civil war."
00:06:11.287,00:06:12.497,in the 2016 election.
00:07:07.885,00:07:22.275,"Uh, every app is carefully scrutinized before ins-- being installed, and-- And, like, now, I'm the dad who reads the privacy policy and says, No, you see here? They read your messages."
00:07:27.613,00:07:31.242,"That's, like, the new way I'm gonna be an annoying parent."
00:07:38.583,00:07:44.589,about how the misuse of our data and information could affect my children's future.
00:07:46.757,00:07:52.805,But it wasn't until after the 2016 election that I realized it had already happened on our watch.
00:07:55.725,00:07:57.643,"It was really, like, a feeling of, like..."
00:07:58.728,00:08:01.314,...the worst-case scenario has happened with technology.
00:08:03.941,00:08:05.109,Hmm.
00:08:05.359,00:08:07.653,I became obsessed with finding answers.
00:08:09.739,00:08:14.785,And the question I kept asking myself was: Who was feeding us fear?
00:08:15.328,00:08:16.412,And how?
00:08:21.417,00:08:28.007,"This was our Project Alamo, where the digital arm of the Trump campaign operation was held."
00:08:29.383,00:08:38.184,"When Project Alamo was at its peak, they were spending one million dollars a day on Facebook ads."
00:08:39.352,00:08:42.188,"We had the Facebook, and YouTube, and Google people."
00:08:42.271,00:08:44.065,They would kind of congregate here.
00:08:44.315,00:08:52.073,"I mean, they were basically our hands-on partners as far as, you know, being able to utilize the platform as effectively as possible."
00:08:52.365,00:08:56.244,But what we also learned is that a company called Cambridge Analytica...
00:08:59.330,00:09:02.708,was also working on Project Alamo.
00:09:04.168,00:09:06.045,Cambridge Analytica was here.
00:09:06.254,00:09:09.840,"And this is kind of the brain of-- of, you know, the data."
00:09:13.219,00:09:15.346,We gotta target this state. We gotta target that state.
00:09:17.515,00:09:20.142,-How would they know that-- -That's-- That's their secret sauce.
00:09:31.904,00:09:34.740,"Okay. Let me just, uh, set up my screen."
00:09:39.870,00:09:41.539,named Paul-Olivier Dehaye.
00:09:51.674,00:09:55.886,"in order to send people personalized messages, you need people's data."
00:09:57.763,00:10:04.186,"And Cambridge Analytica claimed to have 5,000 data points on every American voter."
00:10:07.815,00:10:08.983,But it was invisible.
00:10:10.943,00:10:15.239,"And so the question is, how do you make the invisible visible?"
00:10:27.793,00:10:37.553,"a hypothesis, and the hypothesis was that US voter data was processed by Cambridge Analytica's parent company in Great Britain."
00:10:43.768,00:10:50.650,"And if it was true, I could use a British lawyer to force Cambridge Analytica to give me my data."
00:10:57.990,00:11:02.828,"why data rights should be considered just fundamental rights, simple rights."
00:11:42.660,00:11:45.496,"of the Cambridge Analytica, or SCL, Group."
00:11:46.831,00:11:52.128,"If you spoke to most people that worked at Cambridge Analytica, they would say the same thing."
00:11:52.211,00:11:55.715,"It was, uh... an environment of great innovation."
00:11:57.675,00:11:59.927,"Hello, my name is Alexander Nix."
00:12:00.010,00:12:05.182,"I'm CEO of Cambridge Analytica, the world's leading data-driven communications company."
00:12:05.599,00:12:14.900,"From Mad Men of old to Math Men of today, expert data scientists whose insight can tell you far more about audiences that you want to reach and how to reach them."
00:12:23.868,00:12:36.756,"And then the Obama campaign very successfully used data and digital communications, which created a market opportunity to provide a service to Republican politics in the US."
00:12:47.725,00:12:54.064,in the primaries to being the last man standing before Trump got the nomination.
00:12:55.524,00:12:57.234,Let me first of all say...
00:13:08.537,00:13:10.790,and now we know who came up with all of it.
00:13:10.873,00:13:15.419,"Joining me now, Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica, the company behind it all."
00:13:15.503,00:13:20.007,"It's fascinating, Alexander, to look at all of the work that goes into the ground game."
00:13:20.090,00:13:22.051,Have any of the other candidates called you?
00:13:22.635,00:13:23.969,"Well, um..."
00:13:35.731,00:13:41.737,It's my privilege to speak to you today about the power of big data and psychographics.
00:13:42.530,00:13:48.118,"When Cambridge Analytica joined the Trump campaign, we were an attractive proposition."
00:13:48.744,00:13:59.338,"We'd just spent 14 months working on the Ted Cruz campaign, and had collected a huge amount of voter data and research, which we were able to hand over to the Trump team."
00:14:01.382,00:14:16.981,"By having hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans undertake this survey, we were able to form a model, where we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points we can use to predict the personality of every adult in the United States."
00:14:17.565,00:14:23.362,"Because it's personality that drives behavior, and behavior that obviously influences how you vote."
00:14:24.613,00:14:29.451,We could then start to target people with highly-targeted digital video content.
00:14:33.622,00:14:35.541,either sent or received. Was that true?
00:14:39.920,00:14:44.049,a failed and corrupt political establishment.
00:14:44.133,00:14:46.886,"Why aren't I 50 points ahead, you might ask?"
00:15:02.735,00:15:14.163,"A night that will go down in history, a stunning upset as Donald Trump triumphs over Hillary Clinton, defying the polls, the pundits, and the political class once again, this time elected president of the United States."
00:15:50.115,00:15:58.248,that is that these sorts of technologies can make a huge difference and will continue to do so for many years to come.
00:15:58.958,00:16:00.084,Thank you.
00:16:16.517,00:16:19.937,We were on top of the world. Or at least we thought we were.
00:16:45.045,00:16:54.888,I've been investigating Cambridge Analytica and how that ties to the Brexit campaign to leave the European Union.
00:16:57.391,00:17:05.649,"And this has been my full-time, 12-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week kind of obsession, I would say, since then."
00:17:06.567,00:17:07.901,It's been all-consuming.
00:17:12.281,00:17:18.954,When I first started looking into this whole web of links between Cambridge Analytica and Brexit...
00:17:20.122,00:17:26.754,"I emailed Andy Wigmore, who is an associate of Nigel Farage."
00:17:27.087,00:17:32.634,And Nigel Farage is a very central figure in the Brexit campaign.
00:17:34.470,00:17:36.680,"I sort of said, Oh, can we go for a coffee?"
00:17:37.306,00:17:40.851,I'm really interested in technology and campaigning.
00:17:41.977,00:17:45.272,"And then he just sort of like, he just like laid it all out."
00:17:53.697,00:17:57.034,"So, Andy, he was just like sort of, like, showing me all the photos on his phone."
00:17:57.117,00:17:58.869,This is the inauguration.
00:18:00.913,00:18:02.414,"Then, Oh, it's such a laugh!"
00:18:02.664,00:18:04.583,"We had such a good time. Oh, Donald..."
00:18:06.543,00:18:09.588,"And I was like, How did the introduction to Cambridge Analytica come out?"
00:18:10.923,00:18:14.301,"He was like, You know, it's 'cause Nigel. Nigel's friends with Steve Bannon."
00:18:23.102,00:18:26.772,He's also the Vice President of Cambridge Analytica.
00:18:27.940,00:18:31.068,"So he's like, Yeah, there's this bunch of billionaires in the States."
00:18:31.360,00:18:38.283,"We've all got the same aims, and Brexit was the petri dish for Trump."
00:18:38.367,00:18:41.411,"For most of my life, America is the leader."
00:18:41.703,00:18:56.176,"Now, I would like to think, in my own little way, that what we did with Brexit was the beginning of what is gonna turn out to be a global revolution and that Trump's victory is a part of that."
00:19:05.727,00:19:14.278,"about, you know, how they used artificial intelligence, you know, how they were mining details from Facebook and, um..."
00:19:14.361,00:19:22.369,"And he was like-- And he was like, It's creepy, Carole! He said, The amount of information you can get on people-- People just give it to you!"
00:19:22.452,00:19:24.079,"And he sort of said, It's just so creepy!"
00:19:26.039,00:19:28.041,"So, I just kind of kept going."
00:19:29.751,00:19:31.044,The Brexit work.
00:19:32.462,00:19:37.134,I'd started tracking down all these Cambridge Analytica ex-employees.
00:19:40.470,00:19:44.892,"And, eventually, I got one guy who was prepared to talk to me."
00:19:46.476,00:19:47.519,Chris Wylie.
00:19:51.190,00:19:54.735,"We had this first telephone call, which was insane."
00:19:54.818,00:19:57.654,It was about eight hours long. And...
00:20:05.704,00:20:10.500,"My name is Christopher Wylie, I'm a data scientist and I helped set up Cambridge Analytica."
00:20:12.044,00:20:19.551,"It's incorrect to call Cambridge Analytica a purely sort of data science company or an algorithm, you know, company."
00:20:19.676,00:20:22.930,"You know, it is a full-service propaganda machine."
00:20:32.648,00:20:34.733,And gave it-- And gave it that amazing name.
00:20:39.613,00:20:48.121,"He follows this idea of the Breitbart doctrine, which is that, if you want to fundamentally change society, you first have to break it."
00:20:48.455,00:20:54.711,And it's only when you break it is when you can remold the pieces into your vision of a new society.
00:20:58.257,00:21:03.178,This was the weapon that Steve Bannon wanted to build to fight his culture war.
00:21:04.179,00:21:05.847,And we could build them for him.
00:21:06.431,00:21:14.606,"But I needed to figure out a way of getting data, and so I went to these Cambridge University profs and asked, What do you think?"
00:21:28.328,00:21:48.724,"Kogan offered us apps on Facebook that were given special permission to harvest data not from just the person who used the app or joined the app, but also it would then go into their entire friend network and pull out all of the friends' data as well."
00:21:50.475,00:21:56.148,"If you were a friend of somebody who used the app, you would have no idea that I just pulled all of your data."
00:22:00.777,00:22:06.116,"We took things like status updates, likes, in some cases, private messages."
00:22:08.660,00:22:14.333,"We wouldn't just be targeting you as a voter, we'd be targeting you as a personality."
00:22:16.460,00:22:28.013,We would only need to touch a couple hundred thousand people to build a psychological profile of each voter in all of the United States.
00:22:33.268,00:22:35.354,that their data was being taken in this way?
00:22:44.446,00:22:52.579,"Actually, this is people's personal information, and we're taking it, and we're using it in ways that they don't understand?"
00:22:56.375,00:23:00.670,"Throughout history, you have examples of grossly unethical experiments."
00:23:08.970,00:23:14.434,You are playing with the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness.
00:23:15.769,00:23:24.111,"And not only are you, like, playing with the psychology of an entire nation, you're playing with the psychology of an entire nation in the context of the democratic process."
00:23:34.663,00:23:40.460,"We're now not just threatening to do things, but we're actually doing it."
00:23:45.966,00:23:51.054,We turn now to the burgeoning scandal around voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica.
00:23:51.388,00:24:00.564,David Carroll filed a legal challenge in Britain asking the court to force Cambridge Analytica to turn over all the data it harvested on him.
00:24:00.814,00:24:02.816,Explain what you are demanding.
00:24:03.275,00:24:05.402,"Uh, full disclosure, so..."
00:24:06.945,00:24:14.828,"where did they get our data, how did they process it, who did they share it with, and do we have a right to opt out?"
00:24:18.415,00:24:21.668,"it's got 5,000 data points on many, many millions of people out there."
00:24:22.919,00:24:28.633,"When people can actually see the extent of the surveillance, I think they're going to be shocked."
00:24:30.218,00:24:33.430,We don't work with Facebook data. We don't have Facebook data.
00:24:33.513,00:24:36.766,"Uh, we do use Facebook as a platform, uh, to advertise."
00:24:37.184,00:24:38.351,"Mr. Nix, Channel 4 News."
00:24:38.560,00:24:40.687,Did you mislead Parliament over the Facebook issue?
00:24:47.819,00:24:54.159,super risky legal challenge in another country to get my voter profile.
00:24:54.326,00:24:57.537,"David, don't stop, don't relent."
00:24:58.955,00:25:00.957,"-Keep going. Good. -I'm gonna do it, don't worry."
00:25:05.670,00:25:08.423,Facebook's down 6.35%.
00:25:08.715,00:25:10.717,That's 120 billion dollars.
00:25:11.092,00:25:12.219,This is huge.
00:25:17.349,00:25:20.727,"are searching the headquarters of Cambridge Analytica, in London."
00:25:22.896,00:25:24.523,they're looking for documents.
00:25:29.569,00:25:32.572,but did not go public until three days ago.
00:25:33.365,00:25:34.407,"Really, Facebook?"
00:25:34.491,00:25:41.873,"You forgot to mention that 50 million people had their private data breached, but every time it's my uncle's friend's sister's dog's birthday, I get a notification?"
00:25:50.382,00:25:52.425,a Goliath of big data marketing.
00:25:53.343,00:25:55.262,How hopeful are you of succeeding?
00:26:05.480,00:26:19.619,"Because to admit it means confronting our own susceptibilities, horrific lack of privacy, and hopeless dependency on tech platforms ruining our democracies on various attack surfaces."
00:26:20.370,00:26:23.248,Join the struggle to help get our data back.
00:26:37.345,00:26:41.891,Welcome to our inquiry into disinformation and fake news.
00:26:41.975,00:26:48.231,"I'd like to welcome Christopher Wylie and Paul-Olivier Dehaye, uh, to the committee to give evidence this morning."
00:26:59.618,00:27:08.668,"When-- When you're caught in the Olympics doping, right, there's not a debate about how much illegal drug you took. Right?"
00:27:08.752,00:27:17.719,"Or, Well, he probably would've come in first anyway, or, you know, He only took half of the amount, or-- Doesn't matter. If you're caught cheating, you lose your medal. Right?"
00:27:17.802,00:27:18.928,Because...
00:27:23.683,00:27:24.517,what about next time?
00:27:24.601,00:27:28.146,What about the time after that? Right? You shouldn't win by cheating.
00:27:29.648,00:27:42.911,"A lot of people will say, and I'll say, um, that given that you're someone who worked very closely with these people, uh, for a period of time, why have you decided to speak out against it and give evidence against people who used to be your colleagues?"
00:27:43.286,00:27:49.751,It's a process of coming to terms with what you've created and the impact that that-- that-- that has had.
00:27:49.834,00:27:53.963,"Um, I am incredibly remorseful for my-- my role in setting it up."
00:27:54.214,00:27:59.094,But there's been a lot of attention on me because I'm sort of-- I've become the...
00:27:59.427,00:28:02.347,"uh, you know, the face of it, because I'm the one that's..."
00:28:02.514,00:28:04.557,come forward and put my name to it.
00:28:04.683,00:28:07.894,But someone else that you should be calling to the committee is Brittany Kaiser.
00:28:08.478,00:28:09.813,Who's Brittany Kaiser?
00:28:27.789,00:28:35.505,I'm not that interested in standing up for powerful white men anymore who obviously don't have everybody's best interests at heart.
00:28:41.553,00:28:45.765,"inside Cambridge Analytica, casting herself as a whistle-blower."
00:28:49.352,00:28:52.981,she had a key to Steve Bannon's townhouse in Washington.
00:28:53.064,00:29:01.364,"She spoke at CPAC in 2016, along with Kellyanne Conway, spent election night at the Trump victory party with mega-donor Rebekah Mercer."
00:29:04.826,00:29:09.706,with millionaire Brexit supporter Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign.
00:29:20.091,00:29:21.384,"Why is she talking now, do you think?"
00:29:23.553,00:29:28.475,"She's talking to investigators, and so we'll know the full picture at some point later..."
00:29:53.750,00:30:00.423,that the Brexit campaigns and the Trump campaign could've been conducted illegally.
00:30:03.343,00:30:07.514,"And so, for my own safety, I don't need geolocation of where this is."
00:30:07.680,00:30:09.474,Just me sitting here...
00:30:11.434,00:30:18.858,"the person trying to overthrow two administrations and all of the most powerful companies in the world, all at once."
00:30:20.610,00:30:25.240,With one disjointed but hopefully-soon-seamless narrative.
00:30:27.784,00:30:31.204,The wealthiest companies are technology companies.
00:30:31.913,00:30:34.999,"Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tesla."
00:30:35.500,00:30:45.343,"And the reason why these companies are the most powerful companies in the world is because, last year, data surpassed oil in its value."
00:30:45.802,00:30:48.388,Data is the most valuable asset on Earth.
00:30:49.430,00:30:56.271,And these companies are valuable because they have been exploiting people's assets.
00:30:57.939,00:31:07.740,It wasn't until one of my friends reached out to me to ask was I going to be all right with the way that my story would be seen in history.
00:31:08.867,00:31:11.452,"And I thought, No."
00:31:14.497,00:31:22.171,"And there's probably a lot of information that I could give that would be helpful to making things okay, possibly."
00:31:44.694,00:31:50.408,who tries to shine a big light on how data's been used and abused.
00:31:52.535,00:31:55.038,It's a moment where people have that visceral sense.
00:31:55.121,00:31:59.918,"There is, you know, that there's something wrong here, uh, that we need to fix."
00:32:00.919,00:32:07.967,"And so, I've dropped pretty much everything I was doing to work on this with Brittany Kaiser."
00:32:10.345,00:32:30.657,"I went and found her and met her, and she was very forthcoming What we really need to be understanding is people's levers of persuasion."
00:32:30.740,00:32:34.118,How are we actually going to message voters so that they can under...
00:32:40.333,00:32:46.464,"and communications firm, so-- Uh, no, we only work for the Republicans in the United States."
00:32:48.341,00:32:49.676,And in Britain?
00:32:54.555,00:33:03.481,"At Leave.EU, we're going to be running a large-scale research throughout the nation to really understand why people are interested in staying in or out of the EU."
00:33:03.564,00:33:14.200,"And the answers to that will help inform our policy and our communications, to make sure that we turn out more first-time voters, more unregistered voters, more apathetic voters than ever before."
00:33:34.554,00:33:39.642,her to share what is some reasonably explosive materials that we've been finding.
00:33:40.226,00:33:50.945,"Uh, and, uh... her inbox and her hard drive, uh, really are a treasure trove of... uh, sketchy information."
00:33:53.906,00:33:56.075,And we're still just scratching the surface.
00:34:42.789,00:34:45.041,That's probably why you recognize it. And...
00:34:45.541,00:34:47.376,"I was kind of shocked, you know?"
00:34:48.127,00:34:52.048,The Trump campaign HQ is a reality TV set.
00:34:57.762,00:35:00.765,And the idea of a company...
00:35:01.099,00:35:04.143,conducting large-scale analysis of a population...
00:35:04.227,00:35:05.186,Mm-hmm.
00:35:05.269,00:35:18.324,"...and then identifying the triggers that people have in terms of what's gonna move them from one state to another state, that feels very challenging to the individual's sense of autonomy and freedom..."
00:35:18.407,00:35:19.492,-Mm-hmm. -...uh...
00:35:19.575,00:35:22.203,and to the idea of democracy.
00:35:22.662,00:35:23.704,Doesn't it?
00:35:24.455,00:35:28.000,I don't know. Um... I would challenge that.
00:35:28.668,00:35:36.384,What this strategy is mostly meant to do is to identify people who are still considering -many different options... -Yes.
00:35:36.467,00:35:45.893,"...and educate them on some of the options that are out there, and if they're on the fence, then they can be persuaded to go one way or the other."
00:35:45.977,00:35:48.855,"-Yes, they can. -Uh, again, that is their own choice."
00:35:48.938,00:35:50.398,-But a lot of the times... -Is it?
00:35:54.569,00:36:02.368,"In the end, they're the ones that go to the ballot box I mean, I'm asking you these questions as Brittany Kaiser."
00:36:03.619,00:36:10.334,"I'm not asking you these questions as Cambridge Analytica or SCL, because that's not who you are anymore. Right?"
00:36:10.626,00:36:17.925,I get it. I get it. But-- was ever involved in the contravention of people's human rights?
00:36:29.854,00:36:31.939,working for human rights.
00:36:38.196,00:36:41.407,It wasn't that long ago. Just a decade.
00:36:55.922,00:36:59.842,I told my cousin I applied to intern on the Obama campaign.
00:37:00.092,00:37:01.302,"She was like, Oh, my God."
00:37:01.385,00:37:03.721,"You better get that internship, or I'll die."
00:37:05.014,00:37:07.767,I was part of the team running Obama's Facebook.
00:37:09.310,00:37:14.065,We invented the way social media is used to communicate with voters.
00:37:19.820,00:37:31.123,"I then spent several years working on human rights and international relations, first for Amnesty International, then lobbying at the United Nations and European Parliament."
00:37:34.710,00:37:44.387,"And I used to always say I love human rights campaigning, but sometimes I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall because I can't see the results of what I'm doing."
00:37:44.470,00:37:46.889,I don't know if I'm literally just wasting my time.
00:37:49.433,00:37:52.144,And that's where I was when I met Alexander Nix.
00:38:00.486,00:38:04.240,He was very interested in learning more about my experience with the Democrats.
00:38:04.573,00:38:09.161,"He gave me his card and said, Let me get you drunk and steal your secrets."
00:38:12.248,00:38:16.294,"And in December 2014, he offered me a job."
00:38:21.215,00:38:27.346,Coming across a company where you could actually see your impact was really exciting for me.
00:38:33.894,00:38:47.992,"I got a little more conservative or posh in terms of the way that I dressed and the way that I spoke, and doing things like going on shooting at the weekends and stuff like that."
00:38:48.409,00:38:52.538,It's just very different to what I would normally spend my time doing.
00:39:02.214,00:39:08.554,"It was really interesting. I strapped on my cowboy boots, got into character, got my NRA membership."
00:39:08.721,00:39:11.140,"-Yeah, you joined the NRA, right? -I did, yeah."
00:39:11.223,00:39:14.101,"Just to understand how these people think, -like... -Uh-huh."
00:39:14.268,00:39:15.686,I don't want to use guns.
00:39:15.770,00:39:18.356,-I'm not really interested in guns at all. -Yeah.
00:39:18.439,00:39:20.316,I felt like I was getting to know...
00:39:21.233,00:39:27.281,"people that I used to disagree with a lot, like my grandparents, my aunts, uncles, cousins."
00:39:32.870,00:39:35.498,It was important. It is important.
00:39:38.000,00:39:46.092,"in US politics is that people are so polarized that they can't understand each other, and therefore they can't work together, and therefore nothing gets done."
00:39:59.647,00:40:10.950,I am about to draft some questions for a senator who will be able to ask them to Mark Zuckerberg in the Senate Judiciary hearing on Tuesday.
00:40:11.283,00:40:23.045,How much of Facebook's revenue comes directly from the monetization of users' personal data?
00:40:27.967,00:40:29.552,Exactly.
00:40:30.386,00:40:39.937,The reality is that Facebook knows more about this than pretty much anyone in the world because Facebook is the best platform on which to run experiments.
00:40:42.022,00:40:44.525,And it actually always gets you the best engagement rates.
00:40:44.608,00:40:49.613,We always spend the majority amount of money on any commercial or political campaign in Facebook.
00:40:50.156,00:40:51.866,Always gets the majority of the ad budget.
00:40:51.949,00:40:53.617,"-It does, it does. -Yep."
00:40:59.039,00:41:01.876,and publics in other countries have been experimented on.
00:41:09.508,00:41:12.678,to form personality models for all voters in the US?
00:41:15.556,00:41:19.351,"The truth is, we didn't target every American voter equally."
00:41:20.519,00:41:26.108,The bulk of our resources went into targeting those whose minds we thought we could change.
00:41:26.901,00:41:29.028,We called them the persuadables.
00:41:31.238,00:41:40.873,"They're everywhere in the country, but the persuadables that mattered were the ones in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida."
00:41:44.001,00:41:47.922,"Now, each of these states were broken down by precinct."
00:41:49.215,00:42:03.479,"So, you can say there are 22,000 persuadable voters in this precinct, and if we target enough persuadable people in the right precincts, then those states would turn red instead of blue."
00:42:04.980,00:42:09.693,Our creative team designed personalized content to trigger those individuals.
00:42:09.777,00:42:12.029,Terrorists love porous borders.
00:42:12.112,00:42:15.324,Widespread gaps in border security allow terrorists...
00:42:19.828,00:42:21.664,every platform you can imagine.
00:42:22.122,00:42:24.959,Until they saw the world the way we wanted them to.
00:42:33.384,00:42:35.010,It's like a boomerang.
00:42:35.553,00:42:46.146,"You send your data out, it gets analyzed, and it comes back at you as targeted messaging to change your behavior."
00:43:02.454,00:43:07.209,DCMS Committee announced the future witnesses -for a fake news inquiry. -Yes.
00:43:07.668,00:43:09.712,-There you are. You're-- -Me.
00:43:13.966,00:43:15.634,He's going the day after me.
00:43:16.844,00:43:19.847,Yes. Is it-- Is it all feeling a bit real?
00:43:43.037,00:43:45.497,it was December 2016.
00:43:47.291,00:43:51.587,I said that they'd worked for the Trump campaign and for the Brexit campaign.
00:43:54.465,00:43:58.218,"And I started getting letters from them saying, We never worked for the Leave campaign."
00:44:02.097,00:44:07.019,"And this was baffling because on Leave.EU's website, it said, We hired Cambridge Analytica."
00:44:08.896,00:44:12.650,There were statements from Alexander Nix about how they worked for the Leave campaign.
00:44:13.484,00:44:17.112,"Yeah, I'm afraid we don't talk about that campaign. At all."
00:44:21.158,00:44:22.451,"No, no, we don't discuss it."
00:44:27.915,00:44:30.125,of Leave.EU's press launch.
00:44:32.628,00:44:35.798,"And I was like, well, there, look, it's Brittany Kaiser!"
00:44:35.881,00:44:38.425,She works for Cambridge Analytica.
00:44:38.509,00:44:46.350,She's at the press launch talking about all the clever things that they're going to do with data for the Leave Campaign.
00:44:48.102,00:44:50.979,"Like, what the fuck?"
00:44:51.063,00:44:54.817,How can you carry on denying it? This is nuts!
00:45:00.614,00:45:04.243,that Leave.EU started posting the horrible videos of me.
00:45:14.628,00:45:15.587,"And, like, hitting her."
00:45:15.671,00:45:17.589,Go back to your seat! I'll take care of this.
00:45:22.302,00:45:24.638,and then the last person's carrying a gun.
00:45:26.390,00:45:30.936,"And the whole thing they had, it was set to the music from the Russian national anthem."
00:45:35.065,00:45:36.400,Ugh.
00:45:38.110,00:45:50.330,"The day after that Leave.EU video was put out, the editor of another news organization that I was going to do a report for took me for lunch and said, Actually, we think it's too much of a risk having you present the report."
00:45:53.792,00:46:00.924,It is this sort of visceral thing of living with this disinformation and this propaganda every single day.
00:46:01.216,00:46:07.973,"And feeling the effects of it and knowing that it does work, it does have an impact in real life, whether people believe that or not."
00:46:13.437,00:46:15.439,"You know, I'm used to just writing stories."
00:46:15.522,00:46:18.025,"You write it, and then you go on to the next subject."
00:46:18.108,00:46:21.445,"I'm a feature writer, that's what I did. But I was just like, They've lied."
00:46:21.528,00:46:24.156,And they're lying about something which is actually really massive.
00:46:24.239,00:46:26.533,"'Cause it's, you know, the..."
00:46:27.075,00:46:29.953,rest of the future of our country.
00:46:40.672,00:46:44.218,But there was a tiny sliver of people who didn't.
00:46:44.301,00:46:46.345,These were the persuadables.
00:46:46.678,00:46:52.810,It was all about finding these very few people and then bombarding them with ads.
00:46:55.020,00:46:58.649,This is the thing which was invisible to all of us.
00:47:00.442,00:47:06.448,Let June the 23rd go down in our history as our independence day!
00:47:15.165,00:47:18.043,this decision will define our politics for years to come.
00:47:24.258,00:47:27.553,And what happens after earthquakes? We wait to see.
00:47:33.016,00:47:47.573,"But there is no leave, full stop-- parents are advised not to carry children on baggage trolleys or allow them to play on the escalators."
00:47:50.784,00:47:52.744,"I'm through, I'm through, I'm through, yeah."
00:47:52.828,00:47:59.251,"So, I managed to get into the United Kingdom with no issues, which is really fantastic."
00:48:02.462,00:48:06.091,'cause what you're doing is a monumental undertaking.
00:48:06.174,00:48:07.050,I know.
00:48:07.134,00:48:08.719,And I still fear for your life.
00:48:08.802,00:48:09.803,Yeah.
00:48:17.936,00:48:20.147,just because it'll make powerful people mad.
00:48:20.230,00:48:23.066,"I know. I know, I know, I know. I know."
00:48:26.862,00:48:30.908,Somebody's always got to bring down these jerks.
00:48:31.074,00:48:32.200,Exactly.
00:48:41.126,00:48:44.379,"I don't have $1,000 right now, so I'll have to wait."
00:48:51.720,00:48:53.472,"All right, honey, you stay healthy."
00:48:54.473,00:48:55.599,"Be safe, honey. I love you."
00:48:56.600,00:48:57.809,"Bye-bye, baby."
00:49:09.905,00:49:14.368,but I don't think I can really do much going out in public while I'm here.
00:49:17.162,00:49:23.627,"Last time I left, I was in a very difficult situation with a lot of my friends."
00:49:33.428,00:49:39.601,so angry I continued to work for a company that supported people like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
00:49:42.312,00:49:49.361,"And there's still this whole group of people that are wondering, am I taking the high road, or am I doing something to protect myself?"
00:49:58.161,00:50:01.957,as Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify before Congress tomorrow and Wednesday.
00:50:02.040,00:50:06.670,"Earlier this morning, he announced some new measures in the company's efforts to prevent interference in elections..."
00:50:20.767,00:50:23.729,My name's at the top of the front page of the FT.
00:50:23.812,00:50:24.855,"Oh, shit."
00:50:29.234,00:50:31.111,Zuckerberg braced for Congress grilling.
00:50:31.194,00:50:37.117,Facebook chief will admit that the social network did not do enough to stop its tools being used for harm.
00:50:41.788,00:50:45.834,The big tech companies are evolving into digital kleptocracies.
00:50:46.084,00:50:47.294,Yesterday.
00:50:51.590,00:50:59.389,"I sort of missed the paragraph of, like, I helped build this monster that..."
00:51:01.767,00:51:10.025,"wreaked havoc upon the world and will take decades to recover from, and I feel really bad about that. I don't see that here."
00:51:28.919,00:51:33.131,and the only nation that has jurisdiction over it is ours.
00:51:44.893,00:51:46.228,will come to order.
00:51:52.192,00:52:00.158,"My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community, and bringing the world closer together."
00:52:01.243,00:52:06.206,But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well.
00:52:06.706,00:52:10.961,"Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here."
00:52:11.545,00:52:16.466,"When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had deleted the data."
00:52:16.842,00:52:20.303,"About a month ago, we heard new reports that suggested that wasn't true."
00:52:21.054,00:52:25.225,"So, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did."
00:52:28.103,00:52:30.689,...to address this and to prevent it from happening again.
00:52:31.481,00:52:35.318,"Thank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take your questions."
00:52:36.444,00:52:47.789,"Well, Mr. Zuckerberg, during the 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump campaign to refine tactics under Project Alamo."
00:52:47.873,00:52:50.292,Were Facebook employees involved in that?
00:52:51.585,00:52:54.421,"Senator, I don't know that our employees were involved with Cambridge Analytica."
00:52:54.504,00:52:56.464,"-Yes, they were. -Whoa!"
00:52:57.674,00:53:00.468,The Republican team in DC was. I met them.
00:53:00.677,00:53:06.600,...although I know that we did help out the Trump campaign overall in sales support in the same way that we do with other campaigns.
00:53:06.683,00:53:11.271,"So, they may have been involved and all working together during that time period?"
00:53:11.354,00:53:14.107,Maybe that's something your investigation will find out.
00:53:14.191,00:53:19.946,"Senator, I can certainly have my team get back to you on any specifics there that I don't know sitting here today."
00:53:20.030,00:53:33.585,"Oh, my God. This is the whole point of the hearing, you-- Do you think the 87 million users, do you consider them victims?"
00:53:34.628,00:53:38.048,"Uh, Senator, I think-- Uh..."
00:53:38.215,00:53:46.014,"Yes. I mean, they-- they did not want their information to be sold to Cambridge Analytica by a developer. And-- And..."
00:53:46.348,00:53:47.515,that happened.
00:53:47.682,00:53:49.309,And it happened on our watch.
00:53:49.434,00:53:55.190,"So even though we didn't do it, I think we have a responsibility to be able to prevent that and be able to take action sooner."
00:53:55.690,00:54:04.449,"One of the steps that we need to take now is go do a full audit of all of Cambridge Analytica's systems to understand what they're doing, whether they still have any data..."
00:54:08.495,00:54:10.956,by its association with Cambridge Analytica.
00:54:33.770,00:54:36.064,would know who Cambridge Analytica was.
00:54:50.161,00:54:56.835,"I learnt, for example, that when you're in a PR crisis, the one thing that you can't hire is a PR crisis company."
00:54:57.168,00:54:59.337,We spoke to...
00:55:05.093,00:55:15.395,"went away to think about it, and came back and said, Um... And actually, I thought that's what they were there, um, for."
00:55:15.770,00:55:19.858,"And so it became impossible to, um... to get a voice."
00:55:26.072,00:55:38.168,"The reason that we've called this news conference today is to begin to counter some of the unfounded allegations and, frankly, the torrent of ill-informed and inaccurate speculation."
00:55:47.135,00:55:49.929,Do you think what was done was illegal?
00:55:50.013,00:55:54.517,"We think it is probably illegal according to UK law, and that's what we're challenging."
00:55:54.601,00:55:56.936,We do have a statement from Cambridge Analytica.
00:55:57.020,00:56:05.737,"Cambridge said, David Carroll has no more right to submit this request than a member of the Taliban sitting in a cave in Afghanistan."
00:56:11.743,00:56:16.331,"There were 35,000 media stories per day."
00:56:19.459,00:56:26.841,"They wanted to discredit Trump, they wanted to discredit Brexit, and we were the vehicle for doing it."
00:56:27.634,00:56:31.012,Do you feel that you have skewed democracy?
00:56:31.388,00:56:39.646,By providing campaign services to a candidate who'd been fairly nominated as the Republican representative of the United States?
00:56:40.105,00:56:41.523,How is that possible?
00:56:46.111,00:56:49.864,for pretty much everything that was wrong in the world.
00:56:55.078,00:56:57.622,Are you saying that Cambridge Analytica lies?
00:56:57.705,00:57:00.417,They knowingly misrepresent the truth.
00:57:00.583,00:57:02.168,What's your proof of that?
00:57:02.836,00:57:04.087,I was there.
00:57:08.216,00:57:17.517,"about what had gone on in Cambridge Analytica and SCL during 2015 and 2016, at a time when he was never there."
00:57:18.560,00:57:22.939,"He had worked for the company for nine months, left in 2014."
00:57:23.231,00:57:31.281,"He then went out and pitched the Trump campaign, and lost to us."
00:57:34.242,00:57:37.328,Chris Wylie set out to kill the company.
00:57:46.963,00:57:48.965,I don't know what Brittany was doing.
00:57:54.387,00:57:56.264,Brittany was someone that...
00:57:57.015,00:58:00.185,"I thought was a friend, I know Alexander thought was a friend."
00:58:01.436,00:58:11.738,"But, you know, when the world gets turned upside down, people behave in different ways."
00:58:12.864,00:58:18.495,Maybe even they don't understand why they're doing what they're doing at the time.
00:58:30.131,00:58:35.720,"Uh, go through the emails together, maybe go through other stuff and hash out what's there."
00:58:46.022,00:58:47.273,"Oh, my God."
00:58:52.278,00:58:53.363,That's amazing.
00:58:53.446,00:58:55.990,"I can actually do an entire timeline of everything, if that's the case."
00:59:04.749,00:59:06.626,US Chamber of Commerce...
00:59:07.126,00:59:08.211,Meeting at...
00:59:11.172,00:59:13.883,Leave.EU. That was fun. Run-through.
00:59:15.093,00:59:17.762,I know exactly when everything happened.
00:59:17.845,00:59:19.472,Always. Forever.
00:59:25.687,00:59:30.108,"I've got much more than that, it's just those are the things I forwarded that I think are worthwhile."
00:59:52.171,00:59:53.339,What is this?
00:59:54.257,00:59:55.592,This looks mental.
00:59:57.343,01:00:02.849,"This is a list of, like, the main sources of data."
01:00:04.017,01:00:08.104,"And look, it's got that fucking Facebook data set of 30 million individuals."
01:00:09.939,01:00:11.608,What the fuck!
01:00:16.821,01:00:19.866,That was after we said to Facebook that we deleted that shit!
01:00:20.992,01:00:26.205,This is the 30 million individuals that we got their data through Professor Kogan.
01:00:26.289,01:00:27.498,That's that.
01:00:28.041,01:00:36.174,"And it admits to it right here, Our data makes us different, because we're scraping people's profiles, and other people are not."
01:00:37.967,01:00:38.801,Fuck.
01:00:48.853,01:00:50.772,There's just so much stuff.
01:01:08.039,01:01:13.294,The holy grail of communications is when you can start to change behavior.
01:01:15.171,01:01:20.218,"Uh, Trinidad. This is a great, interesting case history of how we look at problems."
01:01:28.059,01:01:29.727,"And you know, they screw each other."
01:01:30.228,01:01:33.064,"So, we were working for the Indians."
01:02:09.851,01:02:12.729,that is known to all across Trinidad and Tobago.
01:02:13.396,01:02:15.481,Do So! Do So!
01:02:22.071,01:02:24.574,against politics and voting.
01:03:56.541,01:03:58.251,"Look, um..."
01:04:06.843,01:04:08.135,That is a good question.
01:04:10.429,01:04:16.435,"I know already that she is a complicated person, uh, who has..."
01:04:18.521,01:04:20.773,"you know, done some complicated things."
01:04:21.524,01:04:22.608,Uh...
01:04:23.734,01:04:26.571,I believe in redemption.
01:04:28.948,01:04:35.371,"Uh, individual redemption and collective... uh, social redemption."
01:04:35.454,01:04:46.591,"Uh, I'm an idealist. I think we can fix stuff that's broken, uh, and, at the same time, I am a realist about the fact that you can't fix everything. Um..."
01:04:46.716,01:04:49.176,"You know, some things get broken and stay broken."
01:04:54.682,01:05:00.104,"Good morning, welcome to this further session of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee."
01:05:00.187,01:05:04.442,Very pleased to welcome Brittany Kaiser to give evidence to the committee this morning.
01:05:05.276,01:05:14.994,"Now, there was a contact between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica about the use of data in, I think it was 2015, from memory."
01:05:15.202,01:05:18.205,Did you know about that at the time?
01:05:18.414,01:05:44.941,"Uh, so Facebook had announced to all of their clients that they were going to close their clients' access to this data, so we agreed to delete it, but in March 2016, you know, six or eight weeks after our chief data officer said that those data sets were deleted, I have an email from one of our senior data scientists that said that we were actually using Facebook Like data in our modeling."
01:05:45.024,01:05:46.525,Ooh.
01:05:51.155,01:05:53.491,how we were still using that for modeling in March.
01:05:54.700,01:06:07.213,"Ms. Kaiser, you seem to have traveled a long way from an idealistic intern in Barack Obama's campaign, uh, to working for a company that keeps pretty unsavory company, uh, in wishing to make pitches to far-right political parties."
01:06:09.966,01:06:10.883,"Uh, yes."
01:06:11.717,01:06:15.846,"I would say questioning the ethics of it is correct, definitely."
01:06:15.930,01:06:25.940,"But I have been offered introductions to clients that I refused to meet with before, um, such as the Alternative for Germany and Marine Le Pen's campaign."
01:06:26.023,01:06:29.235,I refused to even get on a phone call with them.
01:06:30.361,01:06:31.696,But not UKIP?
01:06:31.988,01:06:33.572,"Not UKIP, no."
01:06:35.116,01:06:38.869,"Um, did you appear and give a presentation to the launch of Leave.EU?"
01:06:38.953,01:06:40.121,"Yes, I did."
01:06:43.082,01:06:45.501,when you subsequently didn't do any work for them.
01:06:45.793,01:06:48.838,"And we didn't do any further work for them after that day, yes."
01:06:50.297,01:06:52.633,What was the nature of the work that you had done so far?
01:06:52.717,01:06:57.388,We had taken receipt of UK Independence Party data and the survey data.
01:06:57.471,01:07:03.352,"She's, like, contradicting Nix a lot, what he said previously."
01:07:03.436,01:07:10.026,"So, I think you've been quite clear, as far as you're concerned, you were working on the campaign, but just not being paid for it?"
01:07:12.862,01:07:24.790,"Just to clarify, for our benefit, to be effective in this space, how big a kind of working set do you need to be able to then use that to create the basis for targeting the whole country in terms of voting?"
01:07:25.082,01:07:39.930,"I'm not a data scientist, so I wouldn't be able to say the minimum number of data points that you would require, uh, but I do know that their targeting tool used to be export-controlled by the British government, so that would mean that the methodology was considered a weapon."
01:07:40.598,01:07:43.267,"Um, weapons-grade communications tactics."
01:07:43.350,01:07:50.858,What you're saying is that the proposal was for Leave.EU to use what you call weapons-grade communications techniques against the UK population?
01:07:57.073,01:08:01.368,What do you actually think the legislators should do in order to better protect people's data?
01:08:06.040,01:08:14.215,"The sole worth of Google and Facebook is the fact that they own, and possess, and hold, and use the personal data of people from all around the world."
01:08:14.965,01:08:21.180,So I think that the best way to move forward are for people to really possess their data like their property.
01:08:23.849,01:08:26.602,"Um, I think that concludes the questions from us today."
01:08:26.685,01:08:30.981,"Just before we close the session, I just have to make a short announcement about Alexander Nix."
01:08:47.081,01:08:48.040,Thank you.
01:08:53.129,01:08:54.088,"Yes, it has!"
01:09:11.772,01:09:13.732,I just got a text from Alexander.
01:09:22.283,01:09:25.619,"Well done, Britt. Looked quite tough, and you did okay."
01:09:26.453,01:09:29.540,With a winky face little emoji.
01:09:31.167,01:09:33.794,It makes me kind of sad. You know what I mean?
01:09:33.878,01:09:37.923,"Like, it's not like he spent three and a half years being an asshole to me. He didn't."
01:09:52.646,01:09:55.441,I'm processing it. There were a lot of revelations.
01:09:57.484,01:10:07.328,"SCL has to file its defense at the end of the month, so, it'll be really interesting to see, like, what they think they can do, especially after this."
01:10:11.373,01:10:15.753,She said that basically psychographics should be classified as a weapon.
01:10:20.216,01:10:23.719,It seems like Kaiser has some moral compass in her.
01:10:26.805,01:10:33.896,"But, so many times, she knew that she was in a dark world and didn't step away."
01:10:33.979,01:10:37.191,And they-- they got-- got her on that a couple of times.
01:10:37.274,01:10:38.192,Yeah.
01:10:45.241,01:10:48.452,"said to you, you know, Let me get you drunk and steal your secrets."
01:10:48.869,01:10:51.789,You knew the kind of company that you were working for.
01:10:51.997,01:10:54.208,I don't know. I guess I trusted him.
01:10:54.500,01:10:56.377,I worked for him for three and a half years.
01:10:56.460,01:10:59.171,He was a friend and mentor. I mean...
01:10:59.463,01:11:05.135,"He actually just sent me a text, although I haven't spoken to him in, I don't know, at least over a month."
01:11:09.056,01:11:12.393,He said that it looked pretty tough but that I did a good job.
01:11:15.938,01:11:18.482,"No, I don't think that's appropriate at this time."
01:11:21.777,01:11:27.658,"Well, I now question, you know, how much of a friendship it actually was."
01:11:52.433,01:11:56.520,it's really amazed me how many people are just keeping their mouths shut.
01:12:01.066,01:12:08.866,"I mean, it was a jaw-dropping moment when Brittany said these are classified as weapons-grade technology."
01:12:09.199,01:12:14.455,And it was actually illegal to use those without the permission of the British government.
01:12:18.125,01:12:19.710,It's psyops.
01:12:20.961,01:12:24.214,Psyops is psychological operations.
01:12:24.298,01:12:32.348,And it's a-- it's a term that the military uses to describe what you do in warfare which isn't warfare.
01:12:32.431,01:12:36.602,"So, essentially, you know, in a place like Afghanistan, you've got a choice."
01:12:36.685,01:12:46.862,"You either bomb the shit out of a village or you try and use other techniques to persuade them that actually, The Taliban's not very good, and you'd be much better off without them."
01:12:51.033,01:12:54.203,SCL started out as a military contractor.
01:12:54.286,01:12:55.454,SCL Defense.
01:13:09.718,01:13:15.099,It's using research to influence behavior of hostile audiences.
01:13:23.440,01:13:24.942,Essentially communication warfare.
01:13:31.031,01:13:34.576,they'd worked in various places in Eastern Europe.
01:13:34.993,01:13:42.918,But the real game changer was they started using information warfare in elections.
01:13:55.222,01:14:02.020,"for the developing world, it was all about practicing some new technology or trick."
01:14:02.354,01:14:07.943,"How to persuade people, how to suppress turnout, or how to increase turnout."
01:14:10.654,01:14:15.075,"And then it's like, Okay, now we've got the hang of it, let's use it in Britain and America."
01:15:19.306,01:15:25.646,"...and expands, but with no branding, so it's unattributable, untrackable."
01:15:29.441,01:15:47.251,"is that if you can't run your own house, Lock her up! Lock her up!"
01:15:47.584,01:15:49.920,Lock her up! Lock her up!
01:15:51.922,01:15:54.424,Let's defeat her in November.
01:16:10.566,01:16:12.526,the Channel 4 undercover video?
01:16:14.069,01:16:15.612,Nobody recognized it.
01:16:18.407,01:16:20.701,When we watched that video...
01:16:21.118,01:16:25.872,"I watched it in the New York office with, um, all the staff there."
01:16:25.956,01:16:27.791,And we knew it was coming out.
01:16:28.000,01:16:30.377,And I think everybody was...
01:16:31.962,01:16:33.255,in a state of shock.
01:16:35.424,01:16:40.095,Everybody walked away from the screen in silence back to their desks.
01:16:51.481,01:16:58.030,"shows Cambridge executives, including CEO Alexander Nix, boasting about the company's role in Trump's win."
01:16:58.488,01:17:06.038,This series of undercover interviews by Channel 4 News also caught Nix on tape talking about potential bribery and entrapment.
01:17:16.882,01:17:19.217,to Cambridge Analytica employees today?
01:17:25.932,01:17:29.686,Alexander Nix has been suspended with immediate effect.
01:17:29.770,01:17:35.484,The company accused of harvesting the data of more than 87 million Facebook users says it is shutting down.
01:17:35.817,01:17:40.489,The company says it intends to file for bankruptcy in the US and the UK.
01:17:44.660,01:17:53.794,and SCL Elections may be shutting operations to limit or restrict the ability of the authority's investigations and also to get rid of evidence.
01:18:04.388,01:18:05.972,is it now the Facebook scandal?
01:18:08.100,01:18:10.185,"I mean, this is not about one company."
01:18:11.436,01:18:16.608,This technology is going on unabated and will continue to go on.
01:18:17.943,01:18:19.653,But Cambridge Analytica's gone.
01:18:20.696,01:18:23.532,"In some senses, I feel that, um..."
01:18:25.867,01:18:40.215,"that because of the way that this technology is moving so fast, and because people don't really understand it, and because there's a lot of concerns about it, there was always going to be a Cambridge Analytica."
01:18:40.632,01:18:43.218,It just sucks for me it was Cambridge Analytica.
01:18:57.816,01:19:06.283,"from Cambridge Analytica over the course of a year, then the thing which made our heads explode was the day before publication, when we got a letter from Facebook."
01:19:06.992,01:19:10.245,"Yeah, it felt like an attempt to-- to cow us into submission."
01:19:10.328,01:19:20.130,"It didn't feel like a sort of-- To me, it didn't feel like a legitimate response-- And you sort of go, you know, why is a great, big organization like you using UK lawyers?"
01:19:20.213,01:19:24.259,"And again, a very aggressive threat for which, actually, they then-- Didn't they apologize?"
01:19:24.342,01:19:26.178,"Yes, they said it was not their finest hour."
01:19:27.971,01:19:46.364,"And up until that point, it was like the tech giants were still, like, the nice guys who wear hoodies, And there was a shift away from big tech being good to saying well, actually, we do need to start asking questions about this and what it is."
01:19:52.829,01:20:10.931,"but it's really important to understand that the Cambridge Analytica story actually points to this much bigger, more worrying story which is that our personal data is out there and being used against us in ways we don't understand."
01:20:14.643,01:20:19.856,"And if David gets his data back, we can hopefully start getting some answers."
01:20:26.863,01:20:28.615,and give me my data.
01:20:30.659,01:20:35.497,We're at the precipice of evasion or accountability.
01:20:38.583,01:20:47.634,"Carole tweeted, Prof. Carroll also giving evidence to European Parliament today on day of deadline for Cambridge Analytica to turn over his data to him."
01:20:47.717,01:20:51.388,"If it fails to do so, it becomes a matter for criminal proceedings."
01:21:00.272,01:21:01.356,Not yet.
01:21:07.445,01:21:11.783,"I've been waiting to hear from my lawyer, and we have heard nothing."
01:21:11.867,01:21:14.244,And so they have not respected the regulator.
01:21:14.327,01:21:16.788,They are not respecting the law.
01:21:17.372,01:21:21.626,"So now that this is becoming a criminal matter, we are now in uncharted waters."
01:21:22.711,01:21:39.436,"And I will continue to pursue it because their model has the potential to affect a population even if it's just a tiny slice of the population, because in the United States, only about 70,000 voters in three states decided the election."
01:21:42.188,01:21:45.275,"Thank you very much, um, Professor Carroll. Um..."
01:21:45.609,01:21:46.818,Mr. Batten.
01:21:51.364,01:22:03.251,Is The Guardian's stand on this a purely politically partisan one in its own intention to assist in any way that it can to reverse and overturn the result of the referendum?
01:22:05.420,01:22:10.258,"This is not a partisan issue, I cannot say that more strongly."
01:22:10.342,01:22:14.304,This is about the integrity of our democracy.
01:22:14.387,01:22:17.057,It's about our national sovereignty.
01:22:17.599,01:22:21.061,And I would think that you would have an interest in that also.
01:22:24.147,01:22:33.782,"I think that we desperately need more information, because we don't how people were targeted and we don't know what data that was based upon."
01:22:34.157,01:22:43.708,One thing we do know is that Facebook has been obstructive in its efforts to help the British Parliament investigate this matter.
01:22:44.084,01:22:53.635,"Uh, really, really, really, you've got to, like, look higher and really see the bigger issue here and the bigger picture and the bigger risks to us all."
01:23:08.066,01:23:12.320,have they broken a sort of moral trust that they have with their consumers?
01:23:12.404,01:23:14.197,"Well, I-- They have with me."
01:23:14.280,01:23:22.455,"I mean, I spent three months, starting in October 2016, trying to say, Guys, I think you're killing democracy, and you're gonna kill your business."
01:23:22.539,01:23:24.833,"-Hi, how are you? I'm Roger. -Hi, how are you?"
01:23:26.835,01:23:31.131,Facebook is designed to monopolize attention.
01:23:31.589,01:23:37.053,"Just taking all of the basic tricks of propaganda, marrying them to the tricks of casino gambling."
01:23:37.137,01:23:39.014,"You know, slot machines and the like."
01:23:39.264,01:23:47.772,"And basically playing on instincts, and fear and anger are the two most dependable ways of doing that."
01:23:47.897,01:24:00.368,"And so, they created a set of tools to allow advertisers to exploit that emotional audience with individual-level targeting, right?"
01:24:00.452,01:24:05.623,"There's 2.1 billion people, each with their own reality."
01:24:05.915,01:24:11.463,"And once everybody has their own reality, -it's relatively easy to manipulate them. -Mmm. Yeah."
01:24:11.546,01:24:16.926,"And the other thing about this is, they know that it's killing me..."
01:24:18.762,01:24:20.597,of what I've viewed as my baby.
01:24:20.680,01:24:24.809,"It is a lot easier to just sort of say, I'm not gonna think about it."
01:24:28.229,01:24:31.191,"...you get tested in your life a few times, right? And..."
01:24:31.483,01:24:33.151,"for me, this was one of those moments."
01:24:33.234,01:24:37.781,"I was either gonna stand up and do something about this, or I wasn't gonna stand up and do anything about anything. Right?"
01:24:37.864,01:24:40.533,Because my fingerprints are on this thing.
01:24:44.621,01:24:47.332,And I just want to be able to...
01:24:48.458,01:24:49.876,sleep at night.
01:25:13.066,01:25:17.487,what happened with you and the Obama people and the Hillary people.
01:25:23.493,01:25:38.925,"And, um, when your family loses all their money and loses their family home and your father, who's the main breadwinner, has brain surgery and can never work again, you have to work for people that pay you."
01:25:45.682,01:25:49.519,"Um, yeah, but it took a while for it all to really fall apart."
01:25:52.147,01:25:57.026,"We lost our family home in 2014, when I started working for Cambridge."
01:26:12.458,01:26:17.338,after previously refusing to testify due to law enforcement investigations into the firm.
01:26:22.343,01:26:23.887,"-Hi, Jo, how are you? -Hello."
01:26:29.142,01:26:38.651,"I remember considering challenging SCL and running through my head, like, how scary it was."
01:26:40.195,01:26:47.243,"The Committee's very grateful, uh, to Alexander Nix for agreeing to come back in front of the committee today to answer our questions..."
01:26:49.204,01:26:52.457,these guys are down for the count and...
01:26:52.540,01:26:54.876,the villain is up against the wall.
01:27:00.298,01:27:02.634,or has everybody turned against him?
01:27:06.763,01:27:09.849,I'd like to make a few short clarifications.
01:27:09.933,01:27:17.273,"Um, these will only take a few minutes, uh, but it is important to be able to frame, uh, my answers."
01:27:17.357,01:27:18.358,He's so nervous.
01:27:18.441,01:27:21.819,"Mr. Nix, I'd be grateful if you'd start with the committee's questions and then see how we go through the hearing."
01:27:22.111,01:27:31.663,"Ordinarily, uh, I would respect that, but these aren't ordinary circumstances, and so, if I may, I'd like to start with a very brief statement just to set out my position."
01:27:31.746,01:27:37.126,I would rather take this on a question by question basis rather than being dealt with as a statement at the beginning.
01:27:37.377,01:27:58.189,"Mr. Collins, you'll have plenty of opportunity, as will all the Committee, to ask me as many questions as you want, but I have to insist on-- I accept that some of my answers could have been clearer-- -Can you answer the first question... -Why is he doing that?"
01:28:02.527,01:28:09.284,"You did pitch to work on the Referendum, and I don't want to dwell on Leave.EU because you've made your position clear."
01:28:09.534,01:28:12.912,"We're really scratching around here, Mr. Farrelly. Um..."
01:28:13.329,01:28:17.417,"We've been working, or I've been working with this company for 15 years. Um..."
01:28:17.500,01:28:20.086,We've never undertaken an election in the UK.
01:28:21.546,01:28:23.673,-I hope I wasn't scratching around. -That is not true.
01:28:26.843,01:28:40.315,"that's subsequently emerged, She knows that I met Julian Assange in February."
01:28:42.108,01:28:47.155,And she knows that I donated to WikiLeaks at some point in Bitcoin.
01:28:49.073,01:28:52.076,"If she prints something about it today, it's going to make..."
01:28:53.202,01:28:56.372,my conversations with my own government really difficult.
01:28:59.083,01:29:12.472,"because you spoke to us about, uh, Julian Assange the last time you came, saying that you made an attempt to gain access to the emails that Julian Assange had, um, the Hillary Clinton emails, in order to benefit your client, the Trump campaign."
01:29:12.555,01:29:15.099,"Well, these were very contentious emails, potentially..."
01:29:17.685,01:29:26.778,"as did every journalist and, I would say, most political consultants on both sides of the aisle in the United States, um, what was contained in them."
01:29:38.122,01:29:40.666,I didn't discuss the US election!
01:29:43.169,01:29:44.337,Paul!
01:29:47.507,01:29:51.469,"I have said to you, it's all coming out, and the question is how."
01:29:51.552,01:30:01.020,"I didn't conspire to leak Hillary's emails, The fact is..."
01:30:02.522,01:30:05.233,-...it looks like I did both. -Does it look like you did both?
01:30:05.316,01:30:08.694,"If I wasn't me, I would say yes, that's what it looks like!"
01:30:11.155,01:30:12.698,That's why I'm freaking out.
01:30:12.782,01:30:15.535,There's gonna be so many people that literally never believe me.
01:30:15.952,01:30:18.496,I will die with people still not believing me.
01:30:27.380,01:30:28.423,All right...
01:30:46.858,01:30:50.194,Surely you can see that you are not the victim here.
01:30:52.947,01:30:59.787,"What happens if, as some of these investigations are concluded, people realize that actually we were simply..."
01:31:00.371,01:31:41.287,"the guys who were, uh, perceived to have contributed to the Trump campaign and were wrongly accredited with being the architects of Brexit and as a result of the polarizing nature of those two political campaigns, the global liberal media took umbrage and decided to put us in their crosshairs and launch a coordinated attack on us as a company in order to destroy our reputations and our business, and all of this was underpinned by a stream of allegations, unfounded, groundless allegations that came from Mr. Wylie, who gave the media the ammunition that they needed..."
01:31:41.662,01:31:47.502,"that they wanted, to be able to attack us for something that, in the case of Brexit, we simply didn't do."
01:31:50.796,01:31:54.717,"Well, if you're sitting where I am right now, you'd probably feel..."
01:31:56.260,01:31:57.470,...quite victimized.
01:31:57.845,01:31:59.514,Where the fuck is my passport?
01:32:01.766,01:32:03.809,Not having a good day right now.
01:32:04.352,01:32:05.645,Did I put it somewhere else?
01:32:10.149,01:32:12.568,I've never put it there before in my life.
01:32:13.110,01:32:15.613,"Not that I'm thinking straight today, so..."
01:32:19.992,01:32:22.662,"I'm flustered. Sorry, guys."
01:32:27.416,01:32:29.460,Coco Mademoiselle makes me feel better.
01:32:30.503,01:32:32.171,At least I smell good.
01:32:38.678,01:32:41.639,I have no idea what's gonna happen in the next coming days.
01:32:43.015,01:32:48.938,"I literally came back here because I wanted to be cooperative, I want to help."
01:33:17.216,01:33:25.933,"that a senior executive at Cambridge Analytica met with Julian Assange from WikiLeaks, which is the entity that distributed the documents that Russia had stolen."
01:33:27.935,01:33:31.022,She says they discussed the US election.
01:33:52.668,01:33:55.087,and they decided to issue a subpoena.
01:33:56.380,01:34:05.097,"We were talking to them in a very, like, friendly, cooperative way and then Carole's article completely changed the way that they see me."
01:34:06.557,01:34:09.518,"And, yeah, I..."
01:34:10.144,01:34:15.399,worked at Cambridge Analytica while they had Facebook data sets.
01:34:16.400,01:34:18.110,"And, you know, I..."
01:34:19.612,01:34:23.074,went to Russia one time while I worked for Cambridge.
01:34:23.157,01:34:25.743,I visited Julian Assange while I worked for Cambridge.
01:34:25.951,01:34:27.787,I once donated to WikiLeaks.
01:34:27.870,01:34:32.416,I pitched the Trump campaign and wrote the first contract.
01:34:33.167,01:34:36.170,"Like, all of these things make it look like I am..."
01:34:36.504,01:34:40.049,"at the center of some big, crazy thing."
01:34:41.258,01:34:44.178,"And I see that, and I can't argue with that."
01:34:46.055,01:34:50.810,I might need to rethink the way that I've been doing things for the past few years.
01:35:08.744,01:35:16.168,talking about all the investigations which have been kicked off in Britain and the US since the story came out.
01:35:16.252,01:35:31.016,"So, there's an investigation by the FBI, by the US, the SEC, by the Department of Justice, by Robert Mueller, and by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the House Intelligence Committee."
01:35:31.100,01:35:34.770,And then these are all the ones which are going on which are connected in Britain.
01:35:38.274,01:35:41.277,Parliament spent 18 months investigating.
01:35:42.403,01:35:44.572,They called in all these witnesses.
01:35:48.284,01:35:54.623,"And at the end of it, their report says very clearly, Our electoral laws are not fit for purpose."
01:35:56.417,01:36:00.421,We literally cannot have a free and fair election in this country.
01:36:01.881,01:36:08.846,"And we can't have it because of Facebook, because of the tech giants who are still completely unaccountable."
01:36:13.058,01:36:15.478,"It sounds, like, quite apocalyptic."
01:36:15.644,01:36:19.815,But it does feel like we are entering into a whole new era.
01:36:20.858,01:36:24.945,We can see that authoritarian governments are on the rise.
01:36:25.362,01:36:31.243,And they're all using these politics of hate and fear on Facebook.
01:36:38.584,01:36:39.919,who's been elected.
01:36:40.002,01:36:49.929,"And we know that WhatsApp, which is a part of Facebook, was really clearly implicated in the dissemination of fake news there."
01:36:51.263,01:36:53.474,And look at what happened in Myanmar.
01:36:54.350,01:37:00.731,There is evidence that Facebook was used to incite racial hatred which caused a genocide.
01:37:07.488,01:37:13.327,We also know that the Russian government was using Facebook's tools in the US.
01:37:17.081,01:37:24.046,There's evidence that Russian intelligence created fake Black Lives Matter memes.
01:37:24.755,01:37:35.724,"And when people clicked on them, they were taken to pages where they were actually invited to protests that were organized by the Russian government."
01:37:40.104,01:37:44.191,"targeting adversary groups, like Blue Lives Matter."
01:37:45.818,01:37:51.657,It's about stoking fear and hate to turn the country against itself.
01:37:52.700,01:37:54.493,Divide and conquer.
01:37:57.329,01:37:58.998,White power!
01:37:59.456,01:38:01.333,Fascist and proud!
01:38:12.553,01:38:14.847,have now been weaponized.
01:38:16.765,01:38:27.985,And it's impossible to know what is what because it's happening on exactly the same platforms that we chat to our friends or share baby photos.
01:38:30.404,01:38:32.489,Nothing is what it seems.
01:38:47.671,01:38:48.923,I'm all right.
01:38:49.006,01:38:55.012,"Um, I stayed here last week and I checked in a suitcase and two bags."
01:38:55.095,01:38:58.474,"And I had to go to the airport and just, like, left."
01:38:58.557,01:39:00.434,So my bags have been here for a week.
01:39:09.068,01:39:12.363,writes for the British newspapers The Observer and The Guardian.
01:39:12.863,01:39:15.282,Can you just say a little bit more about the Facebook data?
01:39:20.955,01:39:27.544,"and what they were targeted with, is a sort of key part of Mueller's investigation."
01:39:34.969,01:39:38.430,for my testimony for the Mueller investigation.
01:39:45.354,01:39:59.451,counting votes on our data screen that some of those votes were made by people who had seen fake news stories paid for by Russia on their Facebook page.
01:40:01.120,01:40:05.749,Maybe I wanted to believe that Cambridge Analytica was just the best.
01:40:07.376,01:40:09.586,It's a convenient story to believe.
01:40:25.060,01:40:28.731,"...service down to our nation's capital, Washington Reagan DC airport."
01:40:40.075,01:40:42.911,You can't really put something like this behind you.
01:40:58.510,01:41:01.805,"Youth engagement, persuasion..."
01:41:03.140,01:41:04.516,apathy.
01:41:12.900,01:41:14.693,But we don't talk about that.
01:41:18.655,01:41:20.949,"Listening to this now, it just sounds like..."
01:41:21.784,01:41:25.913,a criminal admitting to everything he’s done wrong around the world.
01:41:27.498,01:41:28.540,You know?
01:41:29.291,01:41:33.170,"I'm just there, nervously laughing along with him, letting it happen."
01:41:41.386,01:41:46.058,"As I said, it's the opposite of what I've worked my whole life to do."
01:41:47.601,01:41:48.727,So...
01:41:51.814,01:41:55.192,it makes me angry at myself that I could sit through a meeting like that...
01:41:55.943,01:42:00.572,"and not quit directly afterwards, basically."
01:42:04.243,01:42:05.619,What was I doing?
01:42:09.623,01:42:20.092,"I'm currently working to be as helpful as possible to any government investigations where I can provide assistance, but I can't comment on that right now while they're ongoing."
01:42:31.353,01:42:35.023,"However, larger electronic devices must remain stowed."
01:42:38.819,01:42:45.826,But I think it was very brave of her to come out and then to keep cooperating and not to walk away.
01:42:48.620,01:42:56.378,She is one of two people who has blown the whistle in any serious way on Cambridge Analytica.
01:43:00.465,01:43:01.967,We're all responsible.
01:43:04.928,01:43:07.806,"So the question is, what do we do with that responsibility?"
01:43:08.348,01:43:09.683,Can we embrace it?
01:43:14.605,01:43:18.275,so that I can just tell people what happened and get everything...
01:43:19.943,01:43:56.688,on record Its big claim in 2016 was that it had access to voter data on all of the people voting in the US election.
01:43:58.273,01:44:09.826,"Well, just one of the 157 million people who voted in that election, a man called David Carroll, asked them a very simple question: Can I see the data you have on me?"
01:44:10.661,01:44:12.621,And they refused to give it to him.
01:44:14.248,01:44:22.422,"But crucially, today, Cambridge Analytica pled guilty at Hendon Magistrates' Court for failing to comply with the ICO notice."
01:44:43.860,01:44:50.242,"They pleaded guilty for not giving me my data, and I'll probably never get it back."
01:44:53.120,01:45:03.839,"By the time my daughter is 18, she'll have 70,000 data points defining her, and currently she has no rights, no control over that at all."
01:45:06.216,01:45:07.551,But the battle continues.
01:45:13.432,01:45:19.563,I don't have to tell you that there is this dark undertow which is connecting us all globally.
01:45:19.646,01:45:23.567,And it is flowing via the technology platforms.
01:45:24.026,01:45:31.450,"And that is why I am here to address you directly, the Gods of Silicon Valley."
01:45:35.245,01:45:44.671,"Mark Zuckerberg, and Sheryl Sandberg, and Larry Page, and Sergey Brin, and Jack Dorsey."
01:45:46.381,01:45:55.682,Because you set out to connect people and you are refusing to acknowledge that this same technology is now driving us apart.
01:45:56.767,01:46:03.357,"And what you don't seem to understand is that this is bigger than you, and it's bigger than any of us."
01:46:03.440,01:46:08.779,"And it is not about left or right, or leave or remain, or Trump or not."
01:46:09.363,01:46:13.742,It's about whether it's actually possible to have a free and fair election ever again.
01:46:14.368,01:46:18.038,And so my question to you is: Is this what you want?
01:46:19.247,01:46:22.209,Is this how you want history to remember you?
01:46:23.293,01:46:26.922,As the handmaidens to authoritarianism?
01:46:27.464,01:46:31.510,"And my question to everybody else is, is this what we want?"
01:46:31.968,01:46:36.181,To sit back and play with our phones as this darkness falls?
01:46:41.770,01:46:44.272,Who is logged into Facebook right now?
01:46:46.274,01:46:47.359,Almost everybody.
01:46:49.069,01:46:55.534,"So, as individuals, we can limit the flood of data that we're leaking all over the place."
01:46:55.617,01:46:59.496,But there's no silver bullet. There's no way to go off the grid.
01:46:59.579,01:47:05.877,"So, you have to understand how your data is affecting your life."
01:47:07.087,01:47:10.841,Our dignity as humans is at stake.
01:47:33.989,01:47:37.742,begin with the manipulation of one individual.
01:47:39.369,01:47:40.537,Then another.
01:47:42.164,01:47:43.248,And another.
01:47:47.794,01:47:53.758,"So, I can't help but ask myself: Can I be manipulated?"
01:47:57.387,01:47:58.388,Can you?
