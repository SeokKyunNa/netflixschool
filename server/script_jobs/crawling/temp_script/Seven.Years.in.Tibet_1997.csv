00:03:26.874,00:03:28.542,Why must you be this way?
00:03:28.542,00:03:32.171,Why is there always a problem?
00:03:33.922,00:03:36.216,Do you want to go home?
00:03:36.216,00:03:37.843,Would that make--?
00:03:37.843,00:03:39.344,It's the Himalayas.
00:03:39.344,00:03:42.014,How long have I been talking about the Himalayas?
00:03:42.014,00:03:45.559,How long?
00:03:45.559,00:03:49.270,"Horst, when we get there, can you give me a hand, please?"
00:03:49.270,00:03:50.731,"Yes, of course."
00:03:50.731,00:03:52.649,"Ingrid, stop it."
00:04:11.001,00:04:13.545,Let's try to make the best of this.
00:04:16.840,00:04:19.342,Where's this idiot who's supposed to meet us?
00:04:21.136,00:04:22.221,Move.
00:04:23.263,00:04:24.932,Move! Move!
00:04:26.516,00:04:27.893,Mr. Harrer.
00:04:27.893,00:04:29.144,I have your tickets.
00:04:29.144,00:04:30.854,I'm late.
00:04:30.854,00:04:32.564,"No, you don't understand."
00:04:32.564,00:04:34.775,What?
00:04:34.775,00:04:37.527,I am leading the expedition.
00:04:37.527,00:04:41.240,MAN: Here's our celebrity.
00:04:41.240,00:04:48.413,"May I say, Mr. Harrer, on behalf of the Reichssportfuhrer, we are honored to have such a great German hero on the team."
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.832,"Thank you, but I'm Austrian."
00:04:50.832,00:05:01.218,"Yes, but I'm sure that as a distinguished member of the National Socialist Party, you would be proud to plant our country's flag on the summit of Nanga Parbat when you reach it."
00:05:01.218,00:05:03.553,Hans Lobenhoffer.
00:05:03.553,00:05:05.222,Lutz Chicken.
00:05:07.266,00:05:10.852,And a picture with your lovely wife.
00:05:14.856,00:05:17.609,And mister...?
00:05:17.609,00:05:20.612,Family friend.
00:05:22.906,00:05:24.908,"When is the little one due, Mrs. Harrer?"
00:05:24.908,00:05:28.369,About the time my husband reaches the base camp.
00:05:28.369,00:05:31.331,Thank you.
00:05:31.331,00:05:34.293,Why don't you tell the entire country our troubles?
00:05:35.752,00:05:37.087,I'm getting on that train.
00:05:37.087,00:05:39.506,Do you have anything you want to say?
00:05:41.382,00:05:43.384,Fine.
00:05:44.343,00:05:46.305,Go. Leave.
00:05:48.265,00:05:50.517,I'll see you in four months.
00:05:52.644,00:05:54.353,"Take good care of her, Horst."
00:05:54.353,00:05:55.939,"I will, Heinrich."
00:06:03.113,00:06:05.157,Mr. Harrer?
00:07:16.228,00:07:18.939,HEINRICH: We will travel 5000 miles.
00:07:18.939,00:07:24.945,"When we reach India, we will head for the Himalayas and the ninth-highest peak on Earth, Nanga Parbat."
00:07:24.945,00:07:29.324,"Germany calls it Unserberg, Our Mountain."
00:07:29.324,00:07:32.369,"Before us, four German expeditions attempted it."
00:07:32.369,00:07:34.121,All failed.
00:07:34.121,00:07:37.124,Eleven climbers were killed in storms and avalanches.
00:07:37.124,00:07:42.379,"By now, the conquest of Nanga Parbat is a national obsession."
00:07:42.379,00:07:45.173,A matter of German pride.
00:07:49.928,00:07:52.680,"July 29, 1939."
00:07:52.680,00:07:56.893,"We have already made Camp Four at 22,000 feet."
00:07:56.893,00:08:01.731,Overhead is the Rakhiot Glacier and a difficult climb up the icefall.
00:08:04.692,00:08:09.239,The baby must be at least 1 month old now.
00:08:09.239,00:08:12.326,I have been so confused and distracted.
00:08:12.326,00:08:15.578,I can't climb with my usual confidence.
00:08:35.682,00:08:37.684,Heinrich!
00:08:39.436,00:08:40.979,Heinrich!
00:08:42.147,00:08:43.982,Are you all right?
00:08:46.567,00:08:48.362,Heinrich!
00:08:48.362,00:08:50.530,Shit!
00:08:50.530,00:08:52.991,Shit! Shit! Shit!
00:08:52.991,00:08:55.410,Are you all right?
00:08:55.410,00:08:56.703,Shall we come down?
00:08:58.872,00:09:00.790,Lost a crampon.
00:09:00.790,00:09:02.583,Go ahead.
00:09:24.939,00:09:27.692,The weather's getting bad.
00:09:29.528,00:09:31.571,Did you hurt yourself back there?
00:09:31.571,00:09:35.033,Just a scratch. I'll lead.
00:10:04.563,00:10:06.647,Rocks!
00:10:06.647,00:10:08.816,Look out below!
00:10:16.450,00:10:19.702,MAN: Hold me!
00:10:21.413,00:10:22.789,Heinrich!
00:10:27.835,00:10:31.548,Heinrich!
00:10:31.548,00:10:34.092,Have you got me?
00:10:41.724,00:10:44.811,Hold me!
00:11:31.690,00:11:33.067,Oh.
00:11:46.789,00:11:49.292,You should have told me how bad that wound was.
00:11:49.292,00:11:52.462,I should take a look at it.
00:11:58.218,00:11:59.886,It's not your problem.
00:12:02.556,00:12:06.518,"Actually, it is my problem."
00:12:06.518,00:12:07.602,What?
00:12:07.602,00:12:13.400,"When you conceal a serious injury and put my life at risk, I consider that my problem."
00:12:13.400,00:12:16.444,"No, you put your life at risk."
00:12:16.444,00:12:20.739,"Please, it is not your place-- Shut up!"
00:12:22.325,00:12:27.746,"The next time you lie about an injury, Heinrich, you're off the team."
00:12:31.251,00:12:32.877,Try it.
00:13:53.667,00:13:55.752,"HEINRICH: August 4th, Camp Five."
00:13:55.752,00:13:57.337,Some fierce storms have passed.
00:13:57.337,00:14:02.509,My teammates are nervous about the avalanches so we've been holed up for days.
00:14:02.509,00:14:07.472,Aufschnaiter should take advantage of this lowland weather to make high camp.
00:14:07.472,00:14:11.100,But he disagrees with me. Fool.
00:14:12.851,00:14:18.775,"It seems the others don't mind sitting here waiting, hoping, doing nothing."
00:14:18.775,00:14:24.030,So much time to question one's self is not good.
00:14:26.032,00:14:30.328,I am beginning to think this whole expedition was a mistake.
00:14:47.637,00:14:50.056,Run! Avalanche!
00:14:53.476,00:14:56.187,Leave everything!
00:15:10.744,00:15:12.662,Put that down!
00:15:13.996,00:15:15.915,We are going down now!
00:15:15.915,00:15:19.210,"If they're frightened of a storm, send them down to Camp Two."
00:15:19.210,00:15:20.461,I can summit on my own!
00:15:20.461,00:15:22.088,Always give the best man his shot!
00:15:22.088,00:15:24.382,He's trying to tell us he's the best man.
00:15:24.382,00:15:27.093,Give me two Sherpas.
00:15:27.093,00:15:28.969,And my final attack tomorrow!
00:15:28.969,00:15:30.764,We are going down now as a team.
00:15:30.764,00:15:32.056,I've earned that peak.
00:15:32.056,00:15:34.100,I want that peak!
00:15:34.100,00:15:38.688,That is an order!
00:15:38.688,00:15:40.231,Follow me!

00:16:45.839,00:16:48.508,"Take it, sahib."
00:16:48.508,00:16:50.092,"No, that means nothing to me."
00:16:52.011,00:16:54.889,Dalai Lama.
00:16:54.889,00:16:58.267,"Sahib, take it."
00:16:58.267,00:17:00.353,Dalai Lama photo.
00:17:12.490,00:17:14.826,"Good afternoon, Herr Harrer."
00:17:14.826,00:17:19.622,"Well, let's hope that Germany retreats from Poland as quickly as you did from your mountain."
00:17:19.622,00:17:22.166,It might save you some prison time.
00:17:24.043,00:17:25.879,What is this? Who are you?
00:17:25.879,00:17:27.630,"I'm sorry, but you're under arrest."
00:17:27.630,00:17:31.133,What charge?
00:17:31.133,00:17:33.594,"No, I'm afraid not."
00:17:33.594,00:17:37.932,"You see, war has been declared between His Majesty's Government and Germany."
00:17:37.932,00:17:42.144,So all enemy aliens on British Empire soil are now prisoners of war.
00:18:26.022,00:18:28.482,"SOLDIER 1: Stop, or I'll shoot!"
00:18:28.482,00:18:32.070,"HEINRICH: Wait. No, you don't understand."
00:18:32.070,00:18:35.740,I have nothing to do with your silly war.
00:18:40.202,00:18:42.914,I can walk myself.
00:18:42.914,00:18:46.542,I can walk myself!
00:18:46.542,00:18:49.629,"Think you have the last word, but you don't!"
00:18:49.629,00:18:52.590,"Pigs! All of you, pigs!"
00:19:05.728,00:19:08.064,"HEINRICH: October 15, 1939."
00:19:10.274,00:19:20.952,"Reaching prison camp, I make a promise to myself: I will be lying beside Ingrid before the summer solstice of the New Year."
00:19:20.952,00:19:22.870,The Himalayas are right in front of us.
00:19:22.870,00:19:27.207,It will be easy to escape and get lost in them.
00:19:39.762,00:19:43.683,My fourth escape attempt brings me no closer to my goal.
00:19:43.683,00:19:46.686,PRISONER 1: How far did you get this time?
00:19:46.686,00:19:50.815,All I have achieved is a certain dubious celebrity among the prisoners.
00:20:15.715,00:20:20.344,If only my hand could express what is in my heart.
00:20:34.108,00:20:36.610,I hear the guards are mailing letters for you.
00:20:37.737,00:20:39.072,Yes.
00:20:39.072,00:20:40.948,Would you mail these?
00:20:43.910,00:20:46.245,Thank you.
00:20:46.245,00:20:49.040,"Hey, Heinrich, have you read this book?"
00:20:49.040,00:20:51.333,It was checked out to you.
00:20:56.505,00:20:58.174,We need to talk to you.
00:20:58.174,00:21:01.260,What about?
00:21:09.435,00:21:12.438,Impressive.
00:21:12.438,00:21:14.648,After monsoon season.
00:21:16.275,00:21:20.279,I see you've chosen my route.
00:21:20.279,00:21:23.323,"You know, the few foreigners who have tried never came back."
00:21:23.323,00:21:24.491,So good luck.
00:21:24.491,00:21:26.368,Would you like to come with us?
00:21:26.368,00:21:28.287,Why?
00:21:28.287,00:21:31.165,"After all, you are the authority on jailbreak around here."
00:21:31.165,00:21:33.834,We could benefit from your experience.
00:21:33.834,00:21:36.295,"PETER: Please, please, please, please."
00:21:36.295,00:21:39.924,Stop this embarrassing charade.
00:21:39.924,00:21:44.011,"Every time you escape, Heinrich, the patrols are doubled and tripled."
00:21:44.011,00:21:47.140,It is making life very difficult for the rest of us.
00:21:47.140,00:21:50.392,I prefer to travel on my own.
00:21:58.943,00:22:00.653,The mailman has come.
00:22:39.525,00:22:41.110,INGRID: Dear Heinrich.
00:22:41.110,00:22:45.031,Please sign the enclosed divorce papers and send them to my lawyer.
00:22:45.031,00:22:49.243,Horst and I intend to be married as soon as the divorce is finalized.
00:22:49.243,00:22:51.037,"As for your letter, yes."
00:22:51.037,00:22:55.208,"Your son, Rolf Harrer, was born while you were climbing the mountain."
00:22:55.208,00:22:58.919,"He is now 2 years old and calls Horst, Papa."
00:22:58.919,00:23:03.924,"When he is old enough, I will tell him his real father was lost in the Himalayas."
00:23:03.924,00:23:08.428,"It seems the kindest thing to say, considering you never wanted the child anyway."
00:23:08.428,00:23:15.102,"Needless to say, I have no intention of resolving our differences as you suggested."
00:23:15.102,00:23:18.898,They were resolved the moment you left Austria.
00:23:18.898,00:23:26.072,"I'm sorry you have been imprisoned in India and hope this dreadful war will soon be over, for everyone's sake."
00:23:26.072,00:23:27.281,Ingrid.
00:24:56.536,00:24:57.579,I'm coming with you.
00:24:57.579,00:24:59.081,Oh.
00:25:06.504,00:25:08.007,This is your plan?
00:25:11.635,00:25:14.888,"In my humble opinion, this is ridiculous."
00:25:14.888,00:25:18.100,"Then since you are so humble, we won't ask your opinion."
00:26:03.396,00:26:05.563,Open the charts. Turn around.
00:26:05.563,00:26:09.818,Keep your back to the gate.
00:26:24.417,00:26:26.626,MAN: Keep talking.
00:26:29.463,00:26:31.257,We are clear. Okay.
00:26:44.728,00:26:46.730,Open the gates.
00:26:54.196,00:26:56.323,See to this.
00:26:56.323,00:26:57.783,Open the gates.
00:27:32.734,00:27:34.861,I'm going off on my own.
00:27:34.861,00:27:37.448,So good luck.

00:31:07.825,00:31:11.411,Take two and sleep it off.
00:31:15.415,00:31:17.250,What are you doing here?
00:31:17.250,00:31:20.629,"I missed you so much, Heinrich."
00:31:20.629,00:31:22.756,I thought I'd pay you a visit.

00:31:36.812,00:31:38.271,Sorry to hear that.
00:31:38.271,00:31:40.691,I'm sure you're heartbroken.
00:31:42.108,00:31:46.363,May I impose upon your generous nature and camp here tonight?
00:31:46.363,00:31:48.574,Be my guest.
00:31:48.574,00:31:50.075,Thank you.
00:31:50.075,00:31:52.369,It is very gracious of you.
00:32:07.926,00:32:09.261,Hmm.
00:32:12.097,00:32:14.015,Good.

00:32:16.435,00:32:18.144,By the way...

00:32:26.945,00:32:30.115,I don't care if they're repelled all the way back to Tokyo.
00:32:30.115,00:32:32.576,You should if you want to get back to Austria.
00:32:32.576,00:32:34.994,But I don't.
00:32:36.872,00:32:38.832,Plan to go back.
00:32:38.832,00:32:40.459,Why not?
00:32:42.920,00:32:46.089,No particular reason.
00:32:46.089,00:32:51.887,"But when you get there, tell my wife that two years in prison camp is roughly equivalent to four years of marriage."
00:32:51.887,00:32:55.641,And I'm glad to be free of them both.
00:32:55.641,00:32:57.601,Well...
00:32:57.601,00:33:01.939,"I'm not going back either, not until this shameful war is over."
00:33:01.939,00:33:03.398,And where are you headed?
00:33:03.398,00:33:05.024,Tibet.
00:33:05.024,00:33:09.070,"Then on to China, see if I can find some work there."
00:33:10.489,00:33:11.615,And you?
00:33:11.615,00:33:16.411,"By my calculations, the Chinese border is 2058 kilometers away."
00:33:16.411,00:33:18.872,Tibet is 68.
00:33:18.872,00:33:23.460,It's a long way to travel with such a heavy load.
00:33:23.460,00:33:27.005,"No, just full of food."
00:33:27.005,00:33:29.967,Precisely.
00:33:31.468,00:33:32.970,That's too bad.
00:33:32.970,00:33:34.513,Those mountains are treacherous.
00:33:34.513,00:33:36.765,There are glaciers to be crossed.
00:33:36.765,00:33:39.225,"If you had roped up to me, I could've kept you alive."
00:33:39.225,00:33:43.188,"Considering your performance the last time, I'm safer without you."
00:33:48.234,00:33:49.695,Of course.
00:33:50.946,00:33:52.656,Hmm.
00:33:52.656,00:33:53.824,Hmm.
00:33:53.824,00:33:57.870,But I think you are wrong about that Tibetan border calculation.
00:33:57.870,00:34:01.623,"By my measurements, it is 65 kilometers."
00:34:04.584,00:34:06.712,Care to wager a kilo of food on that?
00:34:09.339,00:34:11.008,All you've got is some...
00:34:11.008,00:34:13.510,"stale crackers, Heinrich."
00:34:13.510,00:34:14.887,Hmm.
00:34:14.887,00:34:17.723,But I'm right. I'll win.
00:34:41.496,00:34:43.832,Devils!
00:34:59.056,00:35:01.850,"HEINRICH: Tibet, the roof of the world."
00:35:01.850,00:35:07.814,"It feels as though we have ascended a medieval stone fortress, towering above the center of Asia."
00:35:07.814,00:35:10.400,This is the highest country on Earth.
00:35:10.400,00:35:12.569,And the most isolated.
00:35:20.201,00:35:21.954,Ah.
00:35:21.954,00:35:23.997,There it is.
00:35:23.997,00:35:26.083,Tibet.
00:35:26.083,00:35:29.669,Oh. Exactly 68 kilometers.
00:35:29.669,00:35:32.089,Congratulations.
00:35:32.089,00:35:36.468,"Unfortunately, you've eaten all your winnings."
00:35:36.468,00:35:37.928,Right.
00:35:52.442,00:35:54.152,Yes.
00:35:54.152,00:35:56.989,Just smile and say yes.
00:36:00.366,00:36:03.120,"It's amazing what you learn in prison, isn't it?"
00:36:12.754,00:36:14.422,Tibet.
00:36:17.175,00:36:19.761,No foreigners allowed in Tibet.
00:36:19.761,00:36:21.220,No foreigner. No foreigner.
00:36:21.220,00:36:23.348,"Oh, please."
00:36:28.812,00:36:32.149,"Yes, yes, thank you."
00:36:32.149,00:36:35.360,"Yes, of course."
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.180,No translation needed.
00:37:34.753,00:37:36.880,Some people are glad to see us.
00:37:36.880,00:37:39.132,"Don't let it go to your head, Heinrich."
00:37:39.132,00:37:43.511,"When the Tibetans clap hands, it means they are driving out evil forces."
00:37:49.142,00:37:50.894,"Uh, we need to find food."
00:37:56.108,00:37:59.318,"No, no, no."
00:37:59.318,00:38:02.280,Governor of Province.
00:38:06.076,00:38:07.953,MAN: It is the prophecy.
00:38:07.953,00:38:13.917,It says here in the final testament of great 13th Dalai Lama.
00:38:13.917,00:38:20.423,"It may happen that, in Tibet, religions and government will be attacked by outside forces."
00:38:20.423,00:38:27.139,"Unless we can guard our own country, monks and their monasteries will be destroyed."
00:38:27.139,00:38:30.976,The lands and property of government officials will be seized.
00:38:30.976,00:38:37.774,The Dalai Lama and all the revered holders of the faith will disappear and become nameless.
00:38:37.774,00:38:41.987,Now you understand why we are not welcome to foreigners here?
00:38:41.987,00:38:45.615,"Yes, but you must understand we're not here to threaten or harm."
00:38:45.615,00:38:50.203,"We just need food, and then we'll be on our-- His Excellency, The Garpon."
00:38:56.334,00:39:00.213,"Your Eminence, we're happy to see you."
00:39:00.213,00:39:02.757,We wanted to apologize.
00:39:02.757,00:39:04.092,"Uh, apologize."
00:39:05.760,00:39:07.345,"And, uh..."
00:39:07.345,00:39:11.099,give you this very special gift.
00:39:11.099,00:39:12.642,You have nothing I want.
00:39:12.642,00:39:15.312,"No, please, from us."
00:39:15.312,00:39:18.940,"Long live the Dalai Lama, His Holiness."
00:39:24.154,00:39:25.530,Hmm.
00:39:25.530,00:39:28.867,Thank you for the picture.
00:39:35.373,00:39:40.295,HEINRICH: Two days into Tibet's western frontier and we are graciously kicked out.
00:39:40.295,00:39:48.427,Our guides have strict orders to escort us to the Indian border some 40 kilometers away and to shoot us if we attempt escape.
00:40:22.879,00:40:24.756,Must mean hello.
00:40:24.756,00:40:27.175,As long as they don't try to kiss me.
00:40:27.175,00:40:28.385,Ah.
00:40:29.344,00:40:31.388,Ah. Ah.
00:40:31.388,00:40:32.722,We have to stock up.
00:40:32.722,00:40:35.308,I'm broke.
00:40:35.308,00:40:37.352,Don't look at me.
00:40:37.352,00:40:39.478,"We have to eat, Peter."
00:40:39.478,00:40:41.856,Know what time it is?
00:40:41.856,00:40:44.359,It is not negotiable.
00:40:44.359,00:40:47.153,My father gave it to me when I climbed Mont Blanc.
00:40:47.153,00:40:49.239,"Everyone's climbed Mont Blanc, Peter."
00:40:49.239,00:40:51.657,"If I had a watch like this, I would trade it."
00:41:35.452,00:41:37.787,Where did you get this jacket?
00:41:37.787,00:41:40.539,Communism soldier from China.
00:41:40.539,00:41:42.375,"They give food, money."
00:41:42.375,00:41:43.376,Very nice.
00:41:43.376,00:41:45.420,"Very nice, yeah."
00:41:45.420,00:41:48.506,"You like military uniforms, yes?"
00:41:48.506,00:41:51.592,I have German army boots.
00:41:51.592,00:41:53.470,For you. Yes?
00:41:53.470,00:41:54.971,German army boots. Wait.
00:42:03.355,00:42:06.024,"Give me these, for the guards."
00:42:06.024,00:42:07.692,Look!
00:42:13.698,00:42:15.033,Like this.
00:42:15.033,00:42:16.617,You like?
00:42:16.617,00:42:18.328,You like? Very good.
00:42:18.328,00:42:20.163,They're tough.
00:42:20.163,00:42:21.664,My friend.
00:42:21.664,00:42:23.916,Shall I show you how German soldiers march?
00:42:28.421,00:42:30.340,HEINRICH: You must make this face.
00:42:30.340,00:42:32.800,Hmm. Hmm.
00:42:32.800,00:42:34.593,Hmm.
00:42:37.180,00:42:39.224,"No, no, no, no."
00:42:40.475,00:42:41.600,Come.
00:42:41.600,00:42:42.977,Yes. Stop!
00:42:42.977,00:42:44.229,Stop. Stop.
00:42:45.771,00:42:47.524,Excellent. Excellent.
00:42:47.524,00:42:49.650,"Yes. You, with practice."
00:42:49.650,00:42:51.652,Now...
00:42:51.652,00:42:54.239,I will show you how German soldiers run.
00:42:54.239,00:42:56.699,Ah.
00:42:58.493,00:43:00.578,Stand. Stand like this.
00:43:00.578,00:43:02.288,Like this.
00:43:02.288,00:43:04.374,Yes. Stand. Stand.
00:43:48.751,00:43:51.087,HEINRICH: Guess what?
00:43:52.380,00:43:54.424,All clear.
00:44:17.155,00:44:18.864,Know what time it is?
00:44:22.327,00:44:23.869,"You think, uh..."
00:44:23.869,00:44:29.501,"I'm so happy to be traveling with you I should foot the bill, huh?"
00:44:29.501,00:44:32.920,You are such a big man you don't need to contribute?
00:44:34.046,00:44:35.590,"You have a problem, Peter?"
00:44:35.590,00:44:38.092,"Reminds me, uh..."
00:44:38.092,00:44:41.346,"what you said at the bazaar back there, huh."
00:44:41.346,00:44:42.721,"If, uh..."
00:44:42.721,00:44:47.768,"If I had a watch like that, I would trade it."
00:44:47.768,00:44:48.894,Yeah.
00:44:48.894,00:44:51.730,You did not have one.
00:44:51.730,00:44:55.443,"You cheap, lying bastard."
00:45:07.205,00:45:09.374,This is junk from some Italian prisoners.
00:45:09.374,00:45:12.168,I don't give a shit.
00:45:12.168,00:45:14.629,Haven't you ever heard of a principle?
00:45:14.629,00:45:16.589,What principle?
00:45:16.589,00:45:17.923,You want a watch?
00:45:17.923,00:45:19.842,Go ahead. Pick one.
00:45:19.842,00:45:22.679,And keep your principles.
00:45:22.679,00:45:24.180,Look at you.
00:45:24.180,00:45:26.723,Caught being a selfish brat and you're gloating.
00:45:26.723,00:45:28.809,"You're acting like an old woman, Peter."
00:45:28.809,00:45:30.353,What do you want?
00:45:30.353,00:45:33.772,Try apologizing.
00:45:33.772,00:45:35.941,Try feeling a little remorse.
00:45:35.941,00:45:39.487,"And if all else fails, try wiping that smirk off your face."
00:45:39.487,00:45:42.865,Take your stinking watch and shut up.
00:45:42.865,00:45:47.453,I don't need another boring sermon from some frustrated glorified tour guide.
00:45:57.213,00:45:59.549,No wonder you are always alone.
00:45:59.549,00:46:02.301,No one can stand your miserable company.
00:46:34.751,00:46:36.502,Please.
00:46:36.502,00:46:38.795,Take them.
00:46:46.011,00:46:48.805,It was wrong of me to hide them.
00:46:59.734,00:47:02.069,Keep this.
00:47:02.069,00:47:03.404,No.
00:47:06.783,00:47:08.951,"I didn't deserve it, either."
00:47:10.035,00:47:11.412,Go ahead.
00:47:27.928,00:47:31.349,HEINRICH: He'll be three-and-a-half years old now.
00:47:35.269,00:47:39.106,"Pretty soon, she'll tell him I was lost in the Himalayas."
00:47:42.360,00:47:43.944,Which is fine.
00:47:45.571,00:47:46.989,Why?
00:47:50.242,00:47:53.579,Better a dead father than a lousy father.
00:47:55.164,00:47:56.957,Write him a letter.
00:47:58.376,00:47:59.918,Let him know you're still alive.
00:48:09.804,00:48:12.014,New York.
00:48:16.561,00:48:18.563,Venice.
00:48:23.900,00:48:27.071,Paris.
00:48:27.071,00:48:29.281,It is time for your lesson.
00:48:30.867,00:48:32.451,Shh.
00:48:34.286,00:48:37.415,"MAN: Your Holiness, where are you?"
00:48:37.415,00:48:39.625,It is time for your lesson.
00:48:42.628,00:48:44.171,"HEINRICH: Dear, Rolf Harrer."
00:48:44.171,00:48:50.094,"I'm a person you don't know, a man you've never met."
00:48:50.094,00:48:57.894,"But you are someone who occupies my mind, my heart, in this distant land where I have gone."
00:48:59.228,00:49:14.076,"If you can imagine a hidden place, tucked safely away from the world, concealed by walls of high, snow-capped mountains, a place rich with all the strange beauty of your night-time dreams, then you know where I am."
00:49:16.913,00:49:26.255,"In the country where I am traveling, Tibet, people believe if they walk long distances to holy places, it purifies the bad deeds they've committed."
00:49:26.255,00:49:31.761,"They believe the more difficult the journey, the greater the depth of purification."
00:49:33.721,00:49:39.811,I've been walking from one faraway place to the next for many years.
00:49:39.811,00:49:42.855,As long as you have lived.
00:49:42.855,00:49:46.609,I have seen seasons change across the high plateaus.
00:49:46.609,00:49:54.951,I have seen wild kiangs migrate south in winter and sweep back across the fields when spring appears.
00:49:54.951,00:50:02.082,"In this place, where time stands still, it seems that everything is moving, including me."
00:50:05.586,00:50:12.050,"I can't say I know where I'm going, nor whether my bad deeds can be purified."
00:50:12.050,00:50:16.555,There are so many things I have done which I regret.
00:50:16.555,00:50:25.564,"But when I come to a full stop, I hope you will understand that the distance between us is not as great as it seems."
00:50:25.564,00:50:31.236,"With deep affection, your father, Heinrich Harrer."
00:50:31.236,00:50:35.199,Get up. Peter.
00:50:35.199,00:50:36.909,Get up.
00:50:42.957,00:50:45.209,"Oh, my God."
00:50:50.046,00:50:52.174,I'll give you these.
00:51:12.361,00:51:14.864,Yellow head!
00:51:14.864,00:51:17.867,No! Wait! We have nothing!
00:51:17.867,00:51:20.703,We have no money!
00:51:20.703,00:51:24.040,We have nothing for you!
00:52:29.145,00:52:30.606,Wait!
00:52:31.649,00:52:33.317,Wait!
00:52:33.317,00:52:35.569,Wait!
00:52:35.569,00:52:41.117,Wait. Where are you headed?
00:52:41.117,00:52:43.327,MAN: Holy city. Lhasa.
00:52:43.327,00:52:46.080,I have permit.
00:52:46.080,00:52:49.333,Impossible.
00:52:49.333,00:52:53.587,We have special permission for Lhasa.
00:52:53.587,00:52:56.256,Foreigners not allowed in Lhasa.
00:52:57.591,00:52:59.635,"Lhasa, I have permit."
00:53:45.973,00:53:51.311,It's unseemly for the spiritual leader of Tibet to spy on people.
00:53:54.356,00:53:58.986,"Only a month ago, we were certain of death at the hands of bandits."
00:53:58.986,00:54:04.742,"And today, we have reached the gates of the forbidden city of Lhasa."
00:54:04.742,00:54:13.751,It is as difficult a goal as Mecca and precisely as attractive because it is closed to all foreigners.
00:54:13.751,00:54:19.631,"Even in our miserable condition, we feel the lure of Tibet's holiest city."
00:54:19.631,00:54:21.967,Home of the Dalai Lama.
00:54:21.967,00:54:25.888,Only a few foreigners had penetrated its mysteries.
00:55:31.912,00:55:34.206,"HEINRICH: Oh, my God."
00:55:45.550,00:55:47.219,Is it over?
00:55:47.219,00:55:48.846,"No, it is not over."
00:56:29.178,00:56:33.265,"You are invited to stay for lunch, if you like."
00:56:34.599,00:56:35.976,We'd like that very much.
00:56:37.353,00:56:40.272,I am Tsarong.
00:56:40.272,00:56:42.900,I am Peter.
00:56:46.278,00:56:53.409,"Lord Chamberlain, may I request an audience with the Regent and ministers of the cabinet?"
00:56:53.409,00:56:57.706,It's about two foreigners who came to Lhasa.
00:57:02.627,00:57:16.683,"MAN: With respect, Rinpoche, if your intention is to stop the Chinese from recruiting allies, then demanding they stop trying to bribe monks is not the most effective tactic."
00:57:18.643,00:57:24.400,"I asked the opinion of the ministers, not that of a mere secretary."
00:57:26.443,00:57:28.862,Of course.
00:57:28.862,00:57:30.239,Forgive me.
00:57:30.239,00:57:31.990,You may leave now.
00:57:31.990,00:57:35.493,Start translating the letter as written.
00:57:35.493,00:57:37.121,Of course.
00:57:55.347,00:57:58.934,Do you realize how many men could survive such an ordeal?
00:57:58.934,00:58:01.561,We should respect them.
00:58:01.561,00:58:05.941,"If we return them to India, they'll surely go back to prison."
00:58:05.941,00:58:09.903,"But they have no purpose here, Kungo Tsarong. No place to live."
00:58:09.903,00:58:13.115,I have invited them to stay at my guest quarters.
00:58:13.115,00:58:17.577,"Assuming you would grant them permission to remain in Lhasa, of course."
00:58:17.577,00:58:20.956,Invited them to stay at your place?
00:58:20.956,00:58:22.416,But why?
00:58:22.416,00:58:25.752,Must one have reason to help those in need?
00:58:28.588,00:58:33.093,"Beast. Hey, ow! Ow!"
00:58:35.553,00:58:37.306,I think she said you stink.
00:59:12.216,00:59:15.052,You do not need to introduce yourselves.
00:59:15.052,00:59:17.762,I know who you are.
00:59:17.762,00:59:20.182,I am Pema Lhaki.
00:59:20.182,00:59:25.312,"Ngawang Jigme wishes to make a gift to you, so please take off your clothes."
00:59:28.315,00:59:30.401,Let's get started.
00:59:30.401,00:59:35.906,"Well, this is most kind of Ngawang Jigme."
00:59:35.906,00:59:38.242,Who is he to be so thoughtful?
00:59:38.242,00:59:40.494,Secretary to the ministers of the government.
00:59:40.494,00:59:43.663,He wished to make you a gift of new clothes.
00:59:43.663,00:59:47.167,Select your preferred article of clothing.
00:59:49.836,00:59:51.171,You're a seamstress?
00:59:51.171,00:59:53.048,"I am a tailor, sir."
00:59:53.048,00:59:59.221,The only tailor in Lhasa who has been to Calcutta and can reproduce these silly costumes.
00:59:59.221,01:00:01.681,Okay.
01:00:01.681,01:00:04.476,So I pick?
01:00:04.476,01:00:07.354,Yes.
01:00:08.939,01:00:13.402,And you can make any of these?
01:00:13.402,01:00:17.281,Very good.
01:00:17.281,01:00:18.615,Yes.
01:00:18.615,01:00:20.534,Beautiful.
01:00:20.534,01:00:22.286,HEINRICH: Do you like this?
01:00:22.286,01:00:25.289,Whichever you like.
01:00:26.623,01:00:32.963,"I will have this handsome tweed jacket and this pair of sporting woolen trousers, please."
01:00:32.963,01:00:36.091,Okay. Good choice.
01:00:36.091,01:00:38.302,"And you, sir?"
01:00:41.638,01:00:43.640,Perhaps you could choose for me.
01:00:43.640,01:00:45.517,Thank you.
01:00:48.270,01:00:50.772,"Please, sir, take off your chupa."
01:00:50.772,01:00:52.149,I would like to measure.
01:00:52.149,01:00:53.775,Sure.
01:01:04.702,01:01:07.164,"Stand still, please."
01:01:10.584,01:01:12.586,"This way, please."
01:01:12.586,01:01:14.588,Okay.
01:01:16.507,01:01:19.009,Please stand still.
01:01:28.268,01:01:30.020,"No moving, please."
01:01:39.613,01:01:42.616,"That way, you will never fall."
01:01:42.616,01:01:46.328,"Still, walking up mountains is a fool's pleasure, Heinrich."
01:01:46.328,01:01:48.163,"HEINRICH: Not so foolish, really."
01:01:53.418,01:01:55.212,Look at this.
01:01:57.381,01:01:59.257,Go ahead.
01:02:03.803,01:02:07.599,That's after I climbed the Eiger North Face.
01:02:10.727,01:02:12.688,That's Olympics.
01:02:12.688,01:02:17.025,Gold medal. Not important.
01:02:17.025,01:02:22.030,Then this is another great difference between our civilization and yours.
01:02:22.030,01:02:27.869,You admire the man who pushes his way to the top in any walk of life.
01:02:27.869,01:02:31.707,While we admire the man who abandons his ego.
01:02:33.584,01:02:37.837,The average Tibetan wouldn't think to thrust himself forward this way.
01:02:54.396,01:02:56.481,Gentlemen.
01:02:56.481,01:02:59.817,Mr. Aufschnaiter.
01:02:59.817,01:03:01.111,I'm sorry. Have we met?
01:03:01.111,01:03:05.240,"No, we have not."
01:03:06.575,01:03:08.118,Oh. Ngawang Jigme.
01:03:08.118,01:03:12.205,"Yes, of course."
01:03:12.205,01:03:15.041,Thank you for your generous gift.
01:03:15.041,01:03:17.419,It's wonderful.
01:03:19.504,01:03:22.424,You are most welcome.
01:03:22.424,01:03:24.259,I am sure we will meet again.
01:03:35.395,01:03:53.371,"Perhaps you could help us explain, um, why the ministers demand that the Chinese government cease making generous financial contributions to Tibetan monasteries."
01:03:53.371,01:03:57.793,Do our gifts displease your government?
01:03:57.793,01:04:02.172,"I cannot speak for the Regent nor the ministers, Excellence."
01:04:02.172,01:04:04.675,I am only a mere secretary.
01:04:04.675,01:04:07.761,"Not for long, I presume."
01:04:07.761,01:04:09.220,Sit down.
01:04:10.514,01:04:12.140,Sit down.
01:04:16.645,01:04:24.861,A man of such obvious talent cannot be satisfied with just translating letters.
01:04:24.861,01:04:30.826,Your diplomatic skill would be richly rewarded here.
01:04:33.745,01:04:38.208,"Serving my country faithfully is reward enough, Excellence."
01:04:40.711,01:04:43.004,I ask permission to take my leave.
01:05:37.183,01:05:40.645,"Hello, Heinrich."
01:05:53.366,01:05:56.369,It looks like we're both in need of a good tailor today.
01:05:56.369,01:06:02.083,"Yes, there is a-- Please, take a seat."
01:06:45.669,01:06:48.296,Do you like these?
01:06:48.296,01:06:50.966,"Thank you, but I don't eat much meat."
01:06:50.966,01:06:52.258,Don't eat meat?
01:06:52.258,01:06:54.719,He says they are knives from West.
01:06:54.719,01:06:57.305,You put them on your feet to cut meat.
01:06:58.556,01:07:01.184,"No. No, no."
01:07:01.184,01:07:03.311,They are ice skates.
01:07:03.311,01:07:08.859,"You put them on your feet to skate, to glide."
01:07:08.859,01:07:09.943,"Sort of, dance on ice."
01:07:09.943,01:07:12.821,Yeah.
01:07:12.821,01:07:15.824,Why not?
01:07:19.536,01:07:21.204,Let's get them.
01:07:21.204,01:07:30.588,"How much-- HEINRICH: No, for this?"
01:07:30.588,01:07:32.632,Ten.
01:07:32.632,01:07:34.592,MAN: Ten.
01:07:34.592,01:07:36.427,HEINRICH: And for this?
01:07:36.427,01:07:38.513,Did you see?
01:07:39.973,01:07:41.224,Did you see that?
01:07:48.565,01:07:49.900,Whoa!
01:07:51.693,01:07:53.069,Did you hurt yourself?
01:07:53.069,01:07:55.989,"No, thank you. I'm okay."
01:07:55.989,01:07:59.743,Here we go. Up.
01:07:59.743,01:08:01.995,You okay?
01:08:01.995,01:08:04.039,"No, I'm having fun."
01:08:04.039,01:08:05.081,You must hold on.
01:08:05.081,01:08:07.208,"HEINRICH: Hey, watch me!"
01:08:19.596,01:08:21.514,Do not look too much at the ground.
01:08:21.514,01:08:23.099,All right.
01:08:23.099,01:08:25.268,"Yes, all right."
01:08:25.268,01:08:26.770,Yes.
01:08:41.492,01:08:43.954,Can I help you?
01:08:43.954,01:08:45.080,"Here, take my hand."
01:08:52.921,01:08:55.339,Are you happy?
01:08:55.339,01:08:56.883,Yeah?
01:09:20.197,01:09:30.416,"I try to picture you, Rolf, and this is what I see: A young boy who is strong and bright."
01:09:30.416,01:09:35.546,A boy filled with curiosity about life.
01:09:35.546,01:09:39.134,A boy who isn't afraid to learn from his mistakes.
01:10:03.033,01:10:05.910,"Hello, married woman."
01:10:05.910,01:10:07.704,"Hello, bachelor man."
01:10:09.455,01:10:12.375,Heinrich.
01:10:13.543,01:10:15.670,Congratulations.
01:10:17.755,01:10:20.884,"Well, come in."
01:10:20.884,01:10:29.017,"The Japanese army is facing a growing challenge not from China's unified front, but from the powerful Chinese Communist Army."
01:10:29.017,01:10:31.268,Under the control of Mao Tse-tung...
01:10:34.438,01:10:41.237,The rumor is that the communists have taken over the whole of North and Central China.
01:10:41.237,01:10:43.156,"HEINRICH: Rumor? It's a fact, Peter."
01:10:43.156,01:10:46.325,Ngawang keeps me up to date on all China's war news.
01:10:59.089,01:11:02.759,So how are things at Kungo Tsarong's?
01:11:02.759,01:11:06.387,"Frankly, I wouldn't know."
01:11:06.387,01:11:10.058,Really? It has been this long since we have seen you?
01:11:10.058,01:11:12.268,"Apparently, it has."
01:11:12.268,01:11:14.229,And have you been busy?
01:11:14.229,01:11:20.235,"This is why I'm extremely busy, since I've been hired to survey the entire city of Lhasa."
01:11:20.235,01:11:21.652,Hmm.
01:11:21.652,01:11:26.824,"Unfortunately, your place is too far out for me to include it on my map."
01:11:27.951,01:11:30.411,We like our privacy.
01:11:32.997,01:11:34.749,"Yes, apparently so."
01:11:36.751,01:11:41.131,What about women?
01:11:41.131,01:11:42.882,Women.
01:11:42.882,01:11:48.888,"Since I failed miserably with an Austrian wife, an exotic failure with a Tibetan wife seems misguided."
01:11:48.888,01:11:51.390,"But to answer your question, no, I haven't."
01:11:51.390,01:11:52.892,You?
01:11:55.228,01:11:59.190,"A friend's good fortune is a blessing, Heinrich."
01:11:59.190,01:12:01.276,I'm sorry you resent ours.
01:12:05.113,01:12:07.615,You must be very lonely and sad.
01:12:23.756,01:12:25.382,Heinrich!
01:12:29.762,01:12:32.098,The war is over.
01:12:32.098,01:12:33.766,Have the Communists won?
01:12:33.766,01:12:37.436,"Your war, my friend."
01:12:43.526,01:12:45.569,Where are you going?
01:12:45.569,01:12:49.032,HEINRICH: Back home. Austria.
01:13:07.466,01:13:08.676,"Hello, Tashi."
01:13:10.303,01:13:12.096,Letter.
01:13:16.600,01:13:18.895,We miss you.
01:13:20.396,01:13:22.648,We miss you.
01:13:24.400,01:13:26.319,I miss you too.
01:13:39.456,01:13:44.628,"Dear Mr. Heinrich Harrer, You are not my father."
01:13:44.628,01:13:47.298,Please stop writing me letters.
01:13:48.507,01:13:50.801,Rolf Immendorf.
01:13:58.351,01:14:00.436,Rolf Immendorf.
01:14:19.289,01:14:21.624,Honorable Harry Harrer.
01:14:24.501,01:14:26.379,Honorable Harry Harrer.
01:14:26.379,01:14:29.715,Yes?
01:14:29.715,01:14:33.136,The Honorable Heinrich Harrer doesn't want any more letters.
01:14:33.136,01:14:37.556,"It is from the Great Mother of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama."
01:15:07.044,01:15:09.297,"Thank you for coming, Mr. Harrer."
01:15:09.297,01:15:12.467,"Thank you for inviting me, Great Mother."
01:15:22.059,01:15:25.980,Do you know the rules of protocol concerning my son?
01:15:27.440,01:15:32.987,Not exactly-- I know one bows and performs prostrations.
01:15:34.364,01:15:43.039,"When you are in the presence of His Holiness you must always be standing, bent in obeisance, hands folded in supplication."
01:15:43.039,01:15:47.126,"If seated, you must always be seated lower than he."
01:15:47.126,01:15:51.339,Never look him in the eye.
01:15:51.339,01:15:54.509,Always refer to him as Your Holiness.
01:15:54.509,01:15:58.346,Never turn your back to him.
01:15:58.346,01:16:05.644,"He is the reincarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion."
01:16:05.644,01:16:23.579,"After his recognition, he was renamed: Jetsun Jamphel Ngawang Lobsang Yeshi Tenzin Gyatso Holy Lord, Gentle Glory, Eloquent, Compassionate, Learned Defender of the Faith, Ocean of Wisdom."
01:16:24.539,01:16:28.751,"His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, would like to meet you, Mr. Harrer."
01:16:31.587,01:16:42.557,"As his advisors have not permitted a private audience with you, His Holiness has asked me to bring you along to my monthly audience."
01:16:50.689,01:16:53.484,I'd be honored and moved.
01:18:47.682,01:18:49.433,Hello.
01:18:54.438,01:18:55.856,Yellow head.
01:18:58.442,01:19:00.986,Yellow. Yellow head.
01:19:05.533,01:19:08.994,You have hair on your arms too?
01:19:08.994,01:19:10.996,Uh-hm.
01:19:17.712,01:19:19.004,How about you?
01:19:19.004,01:19:20.839,Mr. Harrer.
01:19:24.968,01:19:27.846,"It's an honor to meet you, Your Holiness."
01:19:40.693,01:19:41.985,Do you like movies?
01:19:44.572,01:19:49.410,"You know, I haven't seen a movie in about eight years, but as I recall, yes, very much."
01:19:49.410,01:19:50.703,So do I.
01:19:50.703,01:19:52.455,I'm glad to hear that.
01:19:52.455,01:19:55.791,I have a movie projector.
01:19:55.791,01:20:01.797,"I want to build a movie house here at the Potala, with seats and everything."
01:20:01.797,01:20:03.299,Seats would be advisable.
01:20:03.299,01:20:05.259,Can you build it?
01:20:07.136,01:20:08.345,Excuse me?
01:20:08.345,01:20:10.139,Can you build a movie house for me?
01:20:10.139,01:20:14.017,"My advisors cannot disapprove, and you will be well-paid."
01:20:14.017,01:20:17.396,And you'll have to come here every day to build it.
01:20:17.396,01:20:19.398,"And when you are here, you'll visit me."
01:20:19.398,01:20:21.858,We can have conversations on many topics.
01:20:21.858,01:20:24.236,I would like to learn about the world you come from.
01:20:24.236,01:20:26.238,"For example, where is Paris, France?"
01:20:26.238,01:20:29.199,And what's a Molotov cocktail?
01:20:29.199,01:20:31.201,Kundun.
01:20:31.201,01:20:33.579,You can tell me many things.
01:20:38.668,01:20:41.796,"I'm proud to be of service, Your Holiness."
01:21:04.777,01:21:07.613,What is the problem?
01:21:07.613,01:21:10.324,What is the problem here?
01:21:10.324,01:21:12.660,"Please, no more hurting worms."
01:21:12.660,01:21:14.829,Please.
01:21:14.829,01:21:20.167,"In a past life, this innocent worm could have been your mother."
01:21:20.167,01:21:22.294,"Please, no more hurting."
01:21:22.294,01:21:25.297,It's impossible.
01:21:27.090,01:21:33.055,"But you see, Tibetans believe all living creatures were their mothers in a past life."
01:21:33.055,01:21:37.476,So we must show them respect and repay their kindness.
01:21:37.476,01:21:41.480,"And never, never harm anything that lives."
01:21:41.480,01:21:44.900,You can't ask a devout people to disregard a precious teaching.
01:21:44.900,01:22:01.124,"Yes, but Your Holiness, with due respect, we can't possibly-- I'm sorry, but we can't possibly rescue all the worms, not if you want the theater finished in this lifetime."
01:22:01.124,01:22:04.336,You have a clever mind.
01:22:04.336,01:22:09.007,"And in the meantime, you can explain to me what is an elevator."
01:22:40.748,01:22:44.960,Antarctica.
01:22:47.504,01:22:50.591,Here.
01:22:50.591,01:22:53.510,Fantastic.
01:22:58.140,01:23:02.561,England.
01:23:02.561,01:23:04.688,Don't look at me for help.
01:23:07.190,01:23:08.692,Here?
01:23:15.950,01:23:17.576,HEINRICH: Shift.
01:23:20.036,01:23:21.789,"Oh, I know him. Honk."
01:23:21.789,01:23:23.165,Hello.
01:23:25.292,01:23:29.004,Turn. Turn. Brake!
01:23:29.004,01:23:31.381,Whoa!
01:23:55.197,01:23:56.991,Heinrich.
01:23:58.534,01:23:59.994,Peter.
01:24:01.161,01:24:06.124,"The robe of a minister is so much finer than your old brown robe, isn't it?"
01:24:07.250,01:24:11.964,Please.
01:24:11.964,01:24:14.675,You must be very clever to get such a good promotion.
01:24:14.675,01:24:17.761,I did not intend to be a secretary forever.
01:24:17.761,01:24:19.722,PETER: Apparently so.
01:24:19.722,01:24:22.349,"Well, congratulations."
01:24:36.238,01:24:38.156,Evil omen. Evil omen.
01:24:43.829,01:24:54.048,"From his headquarters in Peking, the chairman, Mao Tse-tung, was triumphantly proclaimed leader of the new People's Republic of China."
01:24:55.507,01:25:03.015,Chairman Mao vowed that the first task of the communist regime is to reunite the Chinese motherland.
01:25:03.015,01:25:11.231,"He declared that the remote kingdom of Tibet is an integral part of the Chinese territory, and must join the great new republic."
01:25:11.231,01:25:13.609,And must join the great new republic.
01:25:13.609,01:25:22.701,"People's Republic of China is advised, the government of Tibet recognizes no foreign sovereign."
01:25:22.701,01:25:25.287,We are an independent nation.
01:25:25.287,01:25:28.832,All the Chinese officials will be expelled from the borders of Tibet.
01:25:28.832,01:25:32.086,MAN: We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
01:25:32.086,01:25:35.672,Have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
01:25:35.672,01:25:39.217,May you have a safe and pleasant journey back to China.
01:25:41.386,01:25:45.057,We wish you a happy return to your homeland.
01:25:45.057,01:25:47.893,May you have happiness and prosperity.
01:25:47.893,01:25:51.939,Ngawang Jigme.
01:25:53.023,01:25:56.110,You have a very long lifeline.
01:25:56.110,01:26:00.114,Unlike others here.
01:26:58.005,01:27:01.257,"When we are facing the light, it's day, yes?"
01:27:01.257,01:27:03.635,"When we are in shadow, it's night."
01:27:03.635,01:27:15.022,"So if the sun is just rising in Lhasa, that means it is just setting in New York City, perhaps."
01:27:15.022,01:27:19.026,That's why it can't be the same time in every place.
01:27:19.026,01:27:22.696,Does that answer your question?
01:27:22.696,01:27:24.156,Hey.
01:27:51.391,01:27:53.309,Tell me more.
01:27:55.645,01:27:58.065,What else do you want to know?
01:27:59.066,01:28:03.445,"HEINRICH: In a few moments, you will be entering the world of mass media."
01:28:03.445,01:28:06.198,I can hear news from all over the planet?
01:28:06.198,01:28:12.662,"I don't know if they have live broadcasts from the Tonga Islands, but generally speaking, yeah."
01:28:12.662,01:28:15.498,Do you listen to news from your country?
01:28:15.498,01:28:17.834,From Austria?
01:28:17.834,01:28:21.713,"No, not really."
01:28:21.713,01:28:23.924,Why? It's your home.
01:28:23.924,01:28:25.425,"Not any more, it isn't."
01:28:25.425,01:28:28.386,But don't you have friends and family there?
01:28:28.386,01:28:32.224,"A few friends, no family."
01:28:32.224,01:28:35.060,"Keep the light steady, Your Holiness."
01:28:37.187,01:28:39.314,Why? Is everyone dead?
01:28:41.275,01:28:45.445,You know there's another sentence construction aside from the question?
01:28:48.157,01:28:50.575,"I was married, but I'm divorced."
01:28:52.661,01:28:54.121,What did you do?
01:29:02.796,01:29:06.967,"I didn't want a child, so I ran away to climb a mountain."
01:29:06.967,01:29:09.427,"You have a child, Heinrich?"
01:29:11.387,01:29:13.807,Although I've never seen him.
01:29:15.600,01:29:17.060,All right.
01:29:18.394,01:29:20.438,Let me show you how this thing works.
01:29:36.246,01:29:39.249,Give it all you've got.
01:30:21.041,01:30:22.500,Happy Christmas.
01:30:22.500,01:30:25.212,Thank you.
01:30:25.212,01:30:26.380,Thanks. Thank you.
01:30:26.380,01:30:29.383,Happy Christmas.
01:30:29.383,01:30:32.177,"Thank you, Heinrich."
01:30:36.598,01:30:39.393,What is this special occasion?
01:30:39.393,01:30:42.478,"And this is for you, my friend."
01:30:42.478,01:30:43.521,Go on.
01:31:31.194,01:31:34.114,HEINRICH: I found it in a shop in the Barkhor.
01:31:34.114,01:31:38.452,It has traveled a long way and finally come back home.
01:31:38.452,01:31:41.746,Thank you for your friendship.
01:32:05.895,01:32:08.564,"It is, uh..."
01:32:11.026,01:32:13.236,Thank you for saving my life.
01:32:22.287,01:32:26.333,Must be liberated from religious oppressors.
01:32:26.333,01:32:28.377,Tibetans must be reunited...
01:32:28.377,01:32:30.086,Turn that off.
01:32:30.086,01:32:33.465,"I'm very sorry, Mr. Harrer."
01:32:33.465,01:32:36.468,Foreigners control Tibet's corrupt government.
01:32:36.468,01:32:40.847,Our Tibetan comrades must be liberated from foreign imperialists.
01:32:40.847,01:32:44.142,Tibet's million serfs must be...
01:32:44.142,01:32:47.187,How many foreigners are there in Tibet?
01:32:47.187,01:32:50.482,You. Heinrich.
01:33:06.873,01:33:08.582,Ah!
01:33:54.796,01:33:57.715,"He asked for you, Mr. Harrer."
01:34:08.143,01:34:09.727,Kundun?
01:34:11.605,01:34:14.232,They were destroying the village I was born in.
01:34:14.232,01:34:17.235,Takster in Amdo.
01:34:17.235,01:34:19.488,It was terrible.
01:34:19.488,01:34:23.283,It was just a dream.
01:34:23.283,01:34:26.786,But it was so real.
01:34:28.622,01:34:33.001,My mind could never imagine such terrible things.
01:35:15.377,01:35:17.003,I can't sleep.
01:35:17.003,01:35:19.589,I'm afraid the dream will come back.
01:35:22.967,01:35:25.803,A couple of insomniacs.
01:35:28.722,01:35:30.308,"Tell me a story, Heinrich."
01:35:33.102,01:35:35.605,Tell me a story about climbing mountains.
01:35:35.605,01:35:37.899,That's one way to fall asleep.
01:35:38.983,01:35:40.652,Those stories bore even me.
01:35:40.652,01:35:43.154,Then tell me what you love about it.
01:35:43.154,01:35:44.614,What...
01:35:47.576,01:35:52.746,The absolute simplicity.
01:35:52.746,01:35:56.459,"When you're climbing, your mind is clear."
01:35:56.459,01:36:00.630,Freed of all confusions.
01:36:02.215,01:36:04.259,And suddenly...
01:36:04.259,01:36:08.597,"The light becomes sharper, sounds are richer."
01:36:08.597,01:36:11.099,And you are filled with...
01:36:11.099,01:36:14.352,"the deep, powerful presence of life."
01:36:20.149,01:36:22.818,I've only felt that way one other time.
01:36:23.861,01:36:25.739,When?
01:36:30.577,01:36:32.495,"In your presence, Kundun."
01:36:34.914,01:36:38.792,The Chinese have already secured much of the northern border.
01:36:38.792,01:36:42.255,"They have ransacked a village, destroyed the monasteries."
01:36:42.255,01:36:45.007,Burnt scriptures and defaced holy relics.
01:36:45.007,01:36:47.469,We've been told they've even killed some monks.
01:36:47.469,01:36:50.639,Which village?
01:36:50.639,01:36:53.308,It's where His Holiness was born.
01:37:04.611,01:37:06.696,MAN: Go ahead.
01:37:06.696,01:37:08.615,Kungo Tsarong.
01:37:08.615,01:37:13.953,"When you were defense minister to the previous Dalai Lama, then you wanted to reorganize the army."
01:37:13.953,01:37:15.789,Can you do it now?
01:37:15.789,01:37:20.752,The People's Liberation Army is one million troops strong.
01:37:20.752,01:37:27.008,"We have 8000 men, with 50 pieces of artillery and a few hundred mortars and machine guns."
01:37:27.008,01:37:28.718,The task is hopeless.
01:37:28.718,01:37:31.179,"Then you refuse the appointment, do you?"
01:37:33.889,01:37:37.435,"No, I accept it with honor."
01:37:37.435,01:37:40.021,You two gentlemen know about wars.
01:37:40.021,01:37:43.149,What type of weapon do you recommend?
01:37:55.161,01:37:56.912,Heinrich.
01:37:56.912,01:38:00.208,The Chinese troops are advancing toward our northern borders.
01:38:00.208,01:38:01.626,Where's His Holiness?
01:38:01.626,01:38:03.753,MAN: The glory of a British coronation.
01:38:03.753,01:38:06.589,Nowhere in the world is there anything half so wonderful.
01:38:06.589,01:38:13.221,Only once or twice in the life of each one of us comes such a day as this when we know we are watching history in the making.
01:38:13.221,01:38:16.850,We know generations to come will look back on this day.
01:38:16.850,01:38:21.563,"For May 12, 1937, will be one of the dates that the children learn about."
01:38:21.563,01:38:23.189,Maybe a thousand years from now.
01:38:23.189,01:38:25.734,"Every moment, the thrill of excitement..."
01:38:25.734,01:38:32.657,Do you think someday people will look at Tibet on the movie screen and wonder what happened to us?
01:38:33.907,01:38:35.577,I don't know.
01:38:36.870,01:38:39.831,"Don't you have all the answers, Heinrich?"
01:38:39.831,01:38:41.290,No.
01:38:42.916,01:38:44.878,I don't.
01:38:51.843,01:39:01.436,"HEINRICH: On the same field where Tibetans gather for picnics, ground was cleared to build an airstrip so that the plane carrying Chinese generals could land."
01:39:01.436,01:39:05.022,"Nearby, the Tibetan army practiced its maneuvers."
01:39:05.022,01:39:07.817,Some of the soldiers wear ancient mesh armor.
01:39:07.817,01:39:11.279,They bring old muskets and spears as artillery.
01:39:11.279,01:39:16.868,"The spectacle of a peace-loving nation, vainly attempting to create a military."
01:39:16.868,01:39:19.036,The fears of war on my friends' faces...
01:39:19.036,01:39:20.538,Stand at ease!
01:39:20.538,01:39:24.751,...strike a deeply buried personal chord.
01:39:24.751,01:39:33.885,"Echoes of the aggressions of my own country, the will to overpower weaker peoples bring shame to me."
01:39:33.885,01:39:38.473,"I shudder to recall how once, long ago, I embraced the same beliefs."
01:39:38.473,01:39:45.062,"How at one time I was, in fact, no different from these intolerant Chinese."
01:39:46.689,01:39:53.028,The Tibetans say an enemy is the greatest teacher because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion.
01:39:53.028,01:40:00.077,They believe with rock-like faith the power of their religion will protect them against these Chinese.
01:40:00.077,01:40:05.625,"In preparation for the generals' visit, sacred ceremonies are performed throughout Lhasa."
01:40:05.625,01:40:10.171,Sculptures of deities have been carved with great care in butter.
01:40:11.422,01:40:16.093,"As the sun melts them, they become a reminder that nothing lasts."
01:40:29.190,01:40:38.199,"The rising star of the cabinet, Minister Ngawang Jigme, made an offering of his own to greet the Chinese generals and lead them through Lhasa."
01:40:39.200,01:40:40.952,Ngawang.
01:40:40.952,01:40:44.079,Raising their flag is an honor the Chinese don't deserve.
01:40:44.079,01:40:47.750,"When you are not strong enough to fight, you should embrace your enemy."
01:40:47.750,01:40:51.086,"With both arms around you, he cannot point a gun at you."
01:40:51.086,01:40:54.423,"Nothing in politics is a matter of honor, my friend."
01:41:59.321,01:42:05.578,"History repeats itself, even in paradise."
01:42:05.578,01:42:09.540,"General, we shall have our audience with His..."
01:42:34.523,01:42:40.321,NGAWANG: The monks have been making this mandala of sand for days.
01:42:40.321,01:42:42.824,It is a symbol of enlightenment and peace.
01:42:42.824,01:42:45.534,General!
01:42:56.712,01:43:00.424,We do not sit lower than he does.
01:43:00.424,01:43:02.844,"But, General, it is our custom."
01:43:02.844,01:43:05.471,I can sit down there.
01:43:22.155,01:43:25.033,"Your Holiness, this is General Chang Jing Wu."
01:43:25.033,01:43:28.285,"General Than Gua Ha, General Than Gua San."
01:43:28.285,01:43:30.329,They wish to have an audience with you.
01:43:32.540,01:43:36.002,May you have happiness and prosperity.
01:43:37.210,01:43:46.303,They are promising regional autonomy and religious freedom if Tibet accepts that China be its political master.
01:43:49.390,01:43:55.104,"Until I attain my majority, the Regent is the political leader of Tibet."
01:43:55.104,01:44:01.276,You should have requested an audience with him to discuss these important matters of the world.
01:44:01.276,01:44:05.364,My experience of such things is limited.
01:44:06.448,01:44:09.118,I am a simple Buddhist monk.
01:44:09.118,01:44:13.915,All I know is the scripture and the words of Lord Buddha.
01:44:13.915,01:44:19.336,"He said, All beings tremble before danger and death."
01:44:19.336,01:44:21.130,Life is dear to all.
01:44:21.130,01:44:25.968,"When a man considers this, he does not kill or cause to kill."
01:44:25.968,01:44:27.595,You must understand.
01:44:27.595,01:44:32.516,These words are ingrained in the heart of every Tibetan.
01:44:32.516,01:44:39.648,It is why we are a peaceful people who reject violence on principle.
01:44:39.648,01:44:46.239,"I pray you will see this is our greatest strength, not our weakness."
01:44:47.280,01:44:50.243,I thank you for your visit.
01:44:52.912,01:44:57.250,An offering to the enlightened ones.
01:45:10.471,01:45:13.933,Religion is poison.
01:46:24.628,01:46:26.130,No.
01:46:37.058,01:46:49.820,"Today at the dawn, 84,000 troops of the 1st and 2nd Field Armies, under the overall command of General Chang Jing Wu, attacked the Tibetan frontier near Dengo."
01:46:49.820,01:46:53.741,The Tibetan army believes an attack on Chamdo is imminent.
01:46:53.741,01:47:03.251,"Ngawang Jigme, our newly appointed governor, is preparing to send troops toward the Chinese column in order to stop their progression."
01:47:03.251,01:47:07.046,"MAN: As you know, Ngawang Jigme, Chamdo is the gateway to Tibet."
01:47:07.046,01:47:10.091,"If Chamdo falls, the whole of Tibet will fall."
01:47:10.091,01:47:13.344,"If I did not know that, I wouldn't have been appointed."
01:47:13.344,01:47:18.849,"MAN: You do realize, sir, our troops are committed to fight them to the last man?"
01:47:18.849,01:47:21.310,They would rather die than surrender.
01:47:22.770,01:47:27.649,"Rest assured, there will be no surrender as long as I am in Chamdo."
01:50:50.478,01:50:54.064,NGAWANG: Radio Lhasa.
01:50:54.064,01:50:56.358,Now.
01:50:56.358,01:50:59.194,We request permission to surrender.
01:50:59.194,01:51:02.072,"But there will be no surrender-- I said, Radio Lhasa."
01:51:02.072,01:51:05.117,Permission to surrender now.
01:51:51.372,01:51:54.875,"MAN: We lost the war in 11 days, Heinrich."
01:51:54.875,01:51:58.795,This surrender is our death sentence.
01:51:58.795,01:52:04.759,And I'm afraid our friend Ngawang Jigme has issued it.
01:52:04.759,01:52:11.475,He abandoned Chamdo and then destroyed the ammunition dumps.
01:52:11.475,01:52:18.982,Without weapons and ammunition there was no hope for the troops who wanted to fight.
01:52:18.982,01:52:25.197,"Our guerrillas could have held the mountain passes for months, even years."
01:52:25.197,01:52:30.244,It would have bought us time to make appeals for help to other nations.
01:52:30.244,01:52:32.745,Now it's lost.
01:52:32.745,01:52:34.956,They broke down the gates.
01:53:22.795,01:53:25.966,"Hello, my friend."
01:53:32.222,01:53:38.395,"We did what was the best for our country, for Tibet."
01:53:38.395,01:53:42.899,"On the way to Lhasa, I would see Tibetans wearing these jackets."
01:53:42.899,01:53:44.817,Chinese soldiers. Very nice.
01:53:44.817,01:53:49.698,"Give food, clothes, money."
01:53:49.698,01:53:57.289,It's strange to me that something so harmless as a jacket could symbolize such a great lie.
01:54:01.834,01:54:05.756,"After all these years, you still do not understand Tibetan ways."
01:54:05.756,01:54:09.635,To return a gift is unforgivable.
01:54:12.513,01:54:16.975,A man who betrays his culture should not preach about its customs.
01:54:22.731,01:54:27.944,There was a time I would have wished you dead but your shame will be your torture.
01:54:27.944,01:54:31.448,And your torture will be your life.
01:54:31.448,01:54:33.867,I wish it to be long.
01:54:45.504,01:54:52.511,"WOMAN: We pray that His Holiness, the Dalai Lama will be granted the power to unify his people."
01:54:52.511,01:55:01.436,We humbly ask the Tibetan government to honor our request and let the Dalai Lama attain his political majority.
01:55:56.074,01:55:59.286,You have the entire palace in a panic.
01:56:00.913,01:56:03.998,I'm hiding from the world for a day.
01:56:06.835,01:56:09.963,"Kind of difficult in a glass house, no?"
01:56:15.302,01:56:19.681,It's the Moonlight by Debussy.
01:56:22.434,01:56:24.060,What else?
01:56:24.060,01:56:26.062,What else do you know about this song?
01:56:27.898,01:56:30.024,Kundun.
01:58:04.244,01:58:07.205,"Him, him, and him."
01:58:19.509,01:58:23.764,I hope you've received your invitation to the enthronement ceremony.
01:58:23.764,01:58:24.973,Yes. Thank you.
01:58:24.973,01:58:27.267,It's next week.
01:58:41.281,01:58:44.409,Do I look like an egghead?
01:58:44.409,01:58:46.870,"No, they suit you."
01:58:49.039,01:58:55.963,"We have a saying in Tibet, If the problem can be solved, there is no use worrying about it."
01:58:55.963,01:58:59.299,"If it can't be solved, worrying will do no good."
01:59:00.341,01:59:02.844,"So stop worrying, Heinrich."
01:59:02.844,01:59:04.596,You have to leave.
01:59:04.596,01:59:09.225,"You have to leave Tibet, Kundun."
01:59:09.225,01:59:14.147,"Forgive my presumption, but I made arrangements to get you out. Safely."
01:59:14.147,01:59:16.524,We should leave directly after the enthronement.
01:59:16.524,01:59:21.571,The Chinese would never expect it-- How can I help people if I run away from them?
01:59:21.571,01:59:23.197,What kind of leader would I be?
01:59:24.992,01:59:27.119,"I have to stay here, Heinrich."
01:59:27.119,01:59:29.955,Serving others is my path to liberation.
01:59:40.590,01:59:43.760,Then I don't go either.
01:59:43.760,01:59:47.139,Because you are my path to liberation.
01:59:49.099,01:59:54.104,"The Buddha said, Salvation does not come from the sight of me."
01:59:54.104,01:59:58.191,It demands strenuous effort and practice.
01:59:58.191,02:00:02.737,So work hard and seek your own salvation diligently.
02:00:05.198,02:00:07.492,I am not your son...
02:00:09.036,02:00:13.123,and I never thought of you as my father.
02:00:13.123,02:00:16.292,You were much too informal with me for that.
02:00:27.179,02:00:30.182,Do you ever think about him?
02:00:43.945,02:00:46.322,And what do you think about?
02:00:57.458,02:01:01.462,"It's not the conscious thought, really, Kundun."
02:01:01.462,02:01:03.965,He's just always there.
02:01:12.265,02:01:15.810,"When I crossed Tibet, he was with me."
02:01:15.810,02:01:18.105,"When I came to Lhasa, he was with me."
02:01:18.105,02:01:20.398,"When I sit beside you, he's..."
02:01:22.275,02:01:24.402,there with me.
02:01:28.698,02:01:33.161,I can't even imagine how I pictured the world without him in it.
02:01:35.830,02:01:39.417,Then you should go home and be his father.
02:01:46.174,02:01:48.426,I know.
02:01:50.137,02:01:53.014,You have finished your job with me.
02:01:55.767,02:01:57.936,But you have to stay for my enthronement.
02:01:57.936,02:02:01.689,I want you to see me in all my pomp and glory.
02:02:04.276,02:02:06.987,"It'd be a pleasure, my friend."
02:03:25.315,02:03:36.910,"From the government of Tibet, to Your Holiness, the fourteenth Dalai Lama, we ask you to rule your people, as the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet."
02:03:42.456,02:03:47.212,"By your prayers and wishes, I humbly accept."
02:04:41.975,02:04:45.561,Butter tea.
02:04:47.230,02:04:50.275,"No, no, no."
02:04:50.275,02:04:53.278,"Yes, we must follow the custom."
02:04:53.278,02:04:57.449,A fresh cup of tea is poured for the loved one departing.
02:05:01.077,02:05:02.745,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
02:05:02.745,02:05:07.292,"It sits untouched, waiting for his return."
02:06:08.311,02:06:12.524,May all travelers find happiness wherever they go.
02:06:12.524,02:06:17.778,"Without any effort, may they accomplish whatever they set out to do."
02:06:17.778,02:06:26.037,"And having safely returned to the shore, may they be joyfully reunited with their relatives."
02:06:37.590,02:06:39.717,Mr. Harrer.
02:06:43.096,02:06:44.680,From His Holiness.
02:08:15.188,02:08:16.689,Hello.
02:08:16.689,02:08:19.900,"Hello, Horst."
02:08:19.900,02:08:23.571,"Rolf, come out and meet him."
02:08:23.571,02:08:26.658,"ROLF: No, I don't want to."
02:08:28.326,02:08:30.453,May I?
02:10:09.343,02:10:12.513,"Rolf, take your time."
02:10:29.113,02:10:30.948,"Well done, son."
02:10:32.116,02:10:33.618,Well done.
