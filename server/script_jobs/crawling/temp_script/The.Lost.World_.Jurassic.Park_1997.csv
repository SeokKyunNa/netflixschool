00:01:32.667,00:01:35.959,I love you.
00:01:36.000,00:01:38.834,Fabulous!
00:01:38.875,00:01:42.000,You're welcome.
00:01:42.041,00:01:44.000,Thank you.
00:01:44.041,00:01:47.500,Right. Now-- Oh!
00:01:47.542,00:01:49.542,"Thank you, Bernard."
00:01:49.583,00:01:52.417,Thank you.
00:01:52.458,00:01:56.083,Beautiful day.
00:01:56.125,00:01:58.083,Eating my sandwich.
00:01:58.125,00:02:00.166,"We're having prawns, your favorite."
00:02:00.208,00:02:03.041,"Darling, don't wander off."
00:02:03.083,00:02:05.625,"For God's sake, leave her alone, Deirdre."
00:02:05.667,00:02:09.750,"Sweetheart, we'll play with your ball."
00:02:14.667,00:02:18.041,"Darling, what about snakes?"
00:02:19.166,00:02:21.917,There aren't any snakes on the beach.
00:02:21.959,00:02:24.041,Just let her enjoy herself for once.
00:02:27.166,00:02:28.625,Edward!
00:03:02.333,00:03:04.709,"Well, hello there."
00:03:04.750,00:03:08.333,"What are you, some sort of bird or something?"
00:03:13.291,00:03:16.291,Are you hungry?
00:03:16.333,00:03:18.917,It's roast beef.
00:03:18.959,00:03:22.000,Come on.
00:03:22.041,00:03:26.542,Mummy! Daddy!
00:03:40.208,00:03:42.667,"Cathy darling, lunch is ready!"
00:03:42.709,00:03:47.125,Are you looking at this?
00:03:47.166,00:03:50.834,I'm afraid there isn't enough to go around.
00:03:55.458,00:03:58.583,Paul?
00:03:58.625,00:04:01.250,Cathy!
00:04:03.208,00:04:05.250,"Will you hurry up, please?"
00:04:05.291,00:04:06.875,Hurry up!
00:05:03.208,00:05:05.083,"You're him, right?"
00:05:06.375,00:05:08.417,Excuse me?
00:05:08.458,00:05:12.041,The scientist? The guy?
00:05:14.208,00:05:16.834,I believed you.
00:05:48.041,00:05:52.458,Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling?
00:05:52.500,00:05:53.875,I've been summoned.
00:05:54.959,00:05:56.333,Thank you.
00:06:15.792,00:06:18.375,Dr. Malcolm!
00:06:18.417,00:06:21.625,"God-- Oh, my God!"
00:06:21.667,00:06:24.291,Kids! Kids!
00:06:24.333,00:06:27.417,It's so great to see you.
00:06:24.333,00:06:30.834,It's so great-- Look at you.
00:06:30.875,00:06:33.000,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:33.041,00:06:36.000,Do you know what it's about?
00:06:36.041,00:06:39.333,"This joint's kinda creepy, isn't it?"
00:06:39.375,00:06:43.542,Is everything okay?
00:06:53.709,00:06:57.000,"Well, Dr. Malcolm."
00:06:57.041,00:07:01.709,Dr. Malcolm. Here to share a few campfire stories with my uncle?
00:07:07.375,00:07:10.083,You can convince the Washington Post and the Skeptical Inquirer...
00:07:10.125,00:07:12.250,"of whatever you want, but I was there."
00:07:12.291,00:07:14.000,"I know what happened, and so do you."
00:07:14.041,00:07:17.000,Do you actually believe that everyone who chose discretion...
00:07:17.041,00:07:19.750,did so for nefarious motives?
00:07:19.792,00:07:21.125,Signature.
00:07:21.166,00:07:25.000,Leave them out of it.
00:07:25.041,00:07:28.000,You signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island...
00:07:28.041,00:07:31.083,that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.
00:07:31.125,00:07:33.000,You violated that agreement.
00:07:33.041,00:07:35.417,You twisted the facts surrounding the deaths of three people.
00:07:35.458,00:07:43.000,"You stuffed misinformation down the public's throat, which made me look like a nut, hasn't been so good for my livelihood-- We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries."
00:07:43.041,00:07:44.583,That was a payoff and an insult.
00:07:44.625,00:07:48.000,"And when you spin reality, cover up evidence, it hurts."
00:07:48.041,00:07:54.667,"It ruins more than just my reputation. It hurts-- As I recall-- As I recall, your university-- Here, date."
00:07:54.709,00:08:00.792,"revoked your tenure for your selling wild stories to-- I didn't sell anything, never took a cent, and I told the truth."
00:08:00.834,00:08:04.208,Your version of it.
00:08:04.250,00:08:06.041,And I'll tell you something.
00:08:04.250,00:08:10.625,"InGen can't keep spewing out-- InGen is my responsibility now, and I will jealously defend its interests."
00:08:10.667,00:08:12.333,Your responsibility?
00:08:14.125,00:08:18.000,"It is our board of directors which I must look in the eye, not my uncle."
00:08:18.041,00:08:21.959,You must trust me.
00:08:22.000,00:08:25.208,"In a few weeks' time, they'll be long forgotten."
00:08:27.500,00:08:29.125,Not by me.
00:08:29.166,00:08:31.208,Careful.
00:08:33.041,00:08:36.083,This suit cost more than your education.
00:08:37.500,00:08:40.500,"You were right, and I was wrong there."
00:08:40.542,00:08:43.208,Did you ever expect to hear me say such a thing?
00:08:44.333,00:08:48.041,Thank God for Site B.
00:08:48.083,00:08:50.583,Site B?
00:08:50.625,00:08:54.125,"Isla Nublar was just a showroom, something for the tourists."
00:08:54.166,00:08:55.750,Site B was the factory floor.
00:08:55.792,00:08:59.625,"That was on Isla Sorna, 80 miles from Nublar."
00:08:59.667,00:09:03.417,We bred the animals there and nurtured them for a few months...
00:09:03.458,00:09:06.000,and then moved them into the park.
00:09:06.041,00:09:08.000,"Oh, really?"
00:09:08.041,00:09:14.750,"Now, after the accident in the park, Hurricane Clarissa wiped out our facility on Site B."
00:09:14.792,00:09:17.625,Call it an act of God.
00:09:17.667,00:09:20.959,"We had to evacuate, of course, and the animals were released..."
00:09:21.000,00:09:23.458,to mature on their own.
00:09:23.500,00:09:27.792,"Life will find a way, as you once so eloquently put it."
00:09:27.834,00:09:34.000,"And by now we have a complete ecological system on the island, with dozens of species living in their own social groups..."
00:09:34.041,00:09:38.208,"without fences, without boundaries, without constraining technology."
00:09:38.250,00:09:44.750,"And for four years, I've tried to keep it safe from human interference."
00:09:44.792,00:09:46.583,"Well, that's right, that's right."
00:09:46.625,00:09:50.500,"I mean, hopefully, you've kept this island quarantined, uh, and contained."
00:09:50.542,00:09:52.417,But I'm in shock about all this.
00:09:52.458,00:09:55.000,"I mean, that they're still alive."
00:09:55.041,00:09:57.000,You bred them lysine-deficient.
00:09:57.041,00:10:00.000,Shouldn't they have kicked after seven days without supplemental enzymes?
00:10:00.041,00:10:03.417,"Yes! But, by God, they're flourishing!"
00:10:03.458,00:10:07.000,That's one of a thousand questions I want the team to answer.
00:10:07.041,00:10:09.375,Team?
00:10:09.417,00:10:16.875,I've-- I've organized an expedition to go in and-- thank you-- and document them.
00:10:16.917,00:10:21.000,To make the most spectacular living fossil record the world's ever seen.
00:10:21.041,00:10:24.625,Wait a minute.
00:10:24.667,00:10:27.458,Yes. The animals won't even know they're there.
00:10:27.500,00:10:31.709,Very low impact.
00:10:31.750,00:10:34.000,Our satellite infrareds show...
00:10:34.041,00:10:37.041,that the animals are fiercely territorial.
00:10:37.083,00:10:43.458,"The carnivores are isolated in the interior of the island, so the team can stay on the outer rim."
00:10:43.500,00:10:46.750,Don't worry.
00:10:46.792,00:10:50.000,No. You're making-- You're making all new ones.
00:10:50.041,00:11:02.333,"Uh, John, wh-- Okay, so there's another island with dinosaurs-- no fences this time-- and you want to send people in, very few people, on the ground, right?"
00:11:02.375,00:11:05.417,And who are these four lunatics that you're trying to con into this?
00:11:05.458,00:11:11.000,"It was difficult to convince them as to what they were going to see, and in the end I had to use my checkbook to get them there."
00:11:11.041,00:11:21.834,"But there's Nick van Owen, who's a video documentarian, and Eddie Carr, who's a field equipment expert."
00:11:21.875,00:11:25.125,"Uh, we have our paleontologist."
00:11:25.166,00:11:27.667,And I was hoping that perhaps...
00:11:27.709,00:11:29.875,you might be the fourth.
00:11:29.917,00:11:33.166,"Now, look, we've been on the verge of chapter 11..."
00:11:33.208,00:11:38.000,"ever since that accident in the park, and there are those in the company who wanted to exploit Site B..."
00:11:38.041,00:11:40.417,in order to bail us out.
00:11:40.458,00:11:45.208,"They've been planning it for years, and I've been able to stop them up until now."
00:11:45.250,00:11:50.083,"But a few weeks ago, a British family on a yacht cruise..."
00:11:50.125,00:11:56.041,"stumbled across the island, and their wee girl was injured."
00:11:56.083,00:11:57.291,"Oh, she's fine, she's fine."
00:11:57.333,00:12:01.583,But the board has used the incident...
00:12:01.625,00:12:04.417,to take control of InGen from me.
00:12:04.458,00:12:08.125,And now it's only a matter of time before this...
00:12:08.166,00:12:12.417,lost world is found and pillaged.
00:12:12.458,00:12:15.458,Public opinion is the one thing I can use to preserve it.
00:12:15.500,00:12:20.750,"But in order to rally that kind of support, I need a complete photo record..."
00:12:20.792,00:12:23.875,"of those animals, alive and in their natural habitat."
00:12:23.917,00:12:27.000,So you went from capitalist to naturalist in just four years.
00:12:27.041,00:12:29.417,That's-- That's something.
00:12:32.917,00:12:35.667,It's... our last chance...
00:12:35.709,00:12:38.041,at redemption.
00:12:40.125,00:12:44.417,"John, no."
00:12:44.458,00:12:47.792,"Of course, uh, no, and..."
00:12:47.834,00:12:52.375,"I'm gonna contact the other three members of your team, and I'm gonna stop them from going."
00:12:52.417,00:12:55.000,"Who's the paleontologist, by the way?"
00:12:55.041,00:12:59.875,- She came to me.
00:12:59.917,00:13:06.583,"Leave it to you, Ian, to have associations, affiliations, even liaisons, with the best people in so many fields."
00:13:06.625,00:13:10.875,- You didn't contact Sarah?
00:13:06.625,00:13:12.667,"- Paleontological behavior study is a brand-new field, and Sarah Harding is on that frontier."
00:13:12.709,00:13:16.125,No.
00:13:16.166,00:13:17.625,have framed the debate.
00:13:17.667,00:13:20.792,What are you doing?
00:13:22.417,00:13:25.917,It's too late.
00:13:25.959,00:13:28.375,She's already there.
00:13:32.417,00:13:34.917,The others are meeting her in three days.
00:13:40.667,00:13:44.375,You sent my girlfriend to this island alone?
00:13:44.417,00:13:47.208,Sent is hardly the word.
00:13:47.250,00:13:51.792,"She was already working in San Diego, doing research at the animal park."
00:13:51.834,00:13:54.000,It's only a couple of hours' flight from there.
00:13:54.041,00:13:58.000,And she was adamant-- absolutely adamant about-- Here you are.
00:13:58.041,00:14:01.417,About making the initial foray by herself.
00:14:01.458,00:14:05.208,Thinks she's Dian Fossey.
00:14:05.250,00:14:07.834,And she went on and on.
00:14:07.875,00:14:12.000,"After you were injured in the park, she sought you out."
00:14:12.041,00:14:15.208,And then she went all the way to that hospital in Costa Rica...
00:14:15.250,00:14:19.000,to ask somebody who she didn't even know whether the rumors were true.
00:14:19.041,00:14:21.750,"If you want to leave your name on something, fine."
00:14:21.792,00:14:27.166,But stop putting it on other people's headstones.
00:14:27.208,00:14:34.208,"She spent years studying African predators, sleeping downwind and all-- She knows what she's doing."
00:14:34.250,00:14:40.291,"Believe me, the research team will-- It's not a research expedition anymore."
00:14:40.333,00:14:43.333,"It's a rescue operation, and it's leaving right now."
00:15:03.250,00:15:06.709,"You can't shave three days off my deadline, expect everything to be ready."
00:15:06.750,00:15:09.000,I'm not fully supplied.
00:15:09.041,00:15:11.625,of giving her a satellite phone if it doesn't work?
00:15:11.667,00:15:15.834,What is the matter with this?
00:15:15.875,00:15:18.959,"I need half air on the tires here, guys."
00:15:19.000,00:15:21.417,Maybe she doesn't know how to use it?
00:15:21.458,00:15:24.625,She's faxed me refinements on 50% of the plans for this stuff.
00:15:24.667,00:15:27.208,"Ow, ow, ow."
00:15:27.250,00:15:29.000,You gotta love it.
00:15:29.041,00:15:31.667,It'll work when you love it.
00:15:31.709,00:15:34.750,"I don't like the field much, but in this case, I can't resist."
00:15:34.792,00:15:37.417,"Thanks for the two-minute warning, Eddie."
00:15:37.458,00:15:40.208,This is Ian Malcolm.
00:15:40.250,00:15:43.125,Ian's our... Ian.
00:15:43.166,00:15:45.375,"Wildlife, combat, you name it."
00:15:45.417,00:15:48.834,"When I was with Nightline, I was in Rwanda, Chechnya, all over Bosnia."
00:15:48.875,00:15:51.583,Thanks. Do some volunteer work with Greenpeace once in a while.
00:15:51.625,00:15:54.500,Greenpeace?
00:15:54.542,00:15:55.750,Women.
00:15:56.458,00:15:58.834,"Eighty percent female, Greenpeace."
00:15:58.875,00:16:00.000,Noble.
00:16:00.041,00:16:02.166,"Yeah, well, noble was last year."
00:16:02.208,00:16:05.166,This year I'm getting paid.
00:16:02.208,00:16:08.208,"Hammond's check cleared, or I wouldn't be going on this wild-goose chase."
00:16:08.250,00:16:11.166,Where you're going is the only place in the world where the geese chase you.
00:16:12.583,00:16:15.375,"Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!"
00:16:15.417,00:16:18.417,"Oh! Kelly, my honey."
00:16:18.458,00:16:21.500,You found it.
00:16:21.542,00:16:23.959,"Sweetie, that's okay."
00:16:24.000,00:16:28.291,"I gotta tell you, uh, something."
00:16:28.333,00:16:32.625,I don't even know this woman.
00:16:32.667,00:16:35.875,She doesn't even have Sega.
00:16:35.917,00:16:38.125,"Cruel, but good word use."
00:16:38.166,00:16:40.417,Why can't I stay with Sarah?
00:16:40.458,00:16:43.417,Because Sarah is out of town.
00:16:43.458,00:16:45.333,"She said she'd take you horseback riding, to the movies."
00:16:45.375,00:16:48.000,You're gonna have a fantastic time.
00:16:48.041,00:16:51.000,Where are you going anyway?
00:16:51.041,00:16:54.625,I wouldn't be going if it wasn't really important.
00:16:54.667,00:16:56.000,I'm your daughter all the time.
00:16:56.041,00:17:00.000,You can't just abandon me whenever opportunity knocks.
00:17:00.041,00:17:02.500,That hurts my feelings.
00:17:02.542,00:17:04.959,"Dr. Malcolm, downstairs, please."
00:17:05.750,00:17:08.834,"Sweetie, I know we've had some hard going, but in the last couple of years..."
00:17:08.875,00:17:10.625,we've started to work things out.
00:17:10.667,00:17:13.458,Hasn't it been better?
00:17:10.667,00:17:15.875,"Yeah, but I want you to crack on me a bit, ground me, send me to my room."
00:17:15.917,00:17:18.709,You never do any of that stuff.
00:17:18.750,00:17:22.000,'Cause you turned out to be so beautiful and brilliant...
00:17:22.041,00:17:24.166,"and powerful and funny, and generous?"
00:17:24.208,00:17:26.250,"The queen, the goddess, my inspiration."
00:17:26.291,00:17:28.208,Dr. Malcolm.
00:17:28.250,00:17:31.333,"I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin."
00:17:31.375,00:17:36.792,"This is nothing like Austin. Uh-- But, anyway, you got your own stuff."
00:17:36.834,00:17:40.333,You got your gymnastics competition. You've been training for months.
00:17:40.375,00:17:42.750,Gymnastics?
00:17:42.792,00:17:44.917,I got cut from the team.
00:17:46.959,00:17:48.792,"Oh, I'm sorry, honey."
00:17:48.834,00:17:53.250,"I, uh, know how much that meant to you."
00:17:53.291,00:17:56.458,"You like to have kids, but you just don't want to be with them, do you?"
00:17:58.875,00:18:04.250,"I'm not the one who dumped you here and split for Paris, so don't take it out on me."
00:18:04.291,00:18:06.709,"Dr. Malcolm, downstairs."
00:18:13.041,00:18:17.000,"Honey, I'm... sorry."
00:18:17.041,00:18:19.917,"You want some good parental advice, don't listen to me."
00:18:19.959,00:18:21.333,Don't listen to me.
00:18:24.041,00:18:26.458,How we doin' here?
00:18:26.500,00:18:30.625,"Specs say it can't deform at 12,000 P.S.I., so we're just gonna test it."
00:18:30.667,00:18:33.583,"Well, let's clear."
00:18:33.625,00:18:37.500,It's a high hide.
00:18:37.542,00:18:41.125,A high hide.
00:18:41.166,00:18:46.000,It goes up to where the trees are and keeps the researchers out of harm's way.
00:18:46.041,00:18:49.458,"Actually, it'd put 'em at a very convenient biting height."
00:18:49.500,00:18:52.709,"Um, what's the time?"
00:18:52.750,00:18:55.709,Do I have the time? Why?
00:18:55.750,00:18:57.792,Three hours?
00:19:15.166,00:19:16.667,This is so cool.
00:20:16.250,00:20:20.166,Lindstradt air rifle.
00:20:20.208,00:20:23.291,Does it work any better than your satellite phone?
00:20:23.333,00:20:29.417,"I loaded it with the enhanced venom of Conus purpurascens, South Sea cone shell, the most powerful neurotoxin in the world."
00:20:29.458,00:20:33.166,"Acts within a 2,000th of a second, which is faster than the nerve conduction velocity."
00:20:33.208,00:20:36.583,So the animal's down before it even feels the-- pfft-- prick of the dart.
00:20:36.625,00:20:40.000,Is there an antidote?
00:20:40.041,00:20:43.333,Don't do that.
00:20:46.250,00:20:48.834,"Espera, espera."
00:20:48.875,00:20:52.291,The guy wants to unload at the shore right here.
00:20:52.333,00:20:57.709,"He's heard too many stories about this island chain, and he wants to drop us off and anchor offshore."
00:20:57.750,00:20:58.917,What kind of stories?
00:21:04.041,00:21:06.291,"Sí, sí, sí."
00:21:06.333,00:21:08.625,that came too close to the island and never returned.
00:21:11.041,00:21:13.875,"He has the radio, the satellite phone."
00:21:16.041,00:21:18.000,"When you need him, send the call and he'll be here in two hours."
00:21:18.041,00:21:20.875,- But he will not stay here.
00:21:22.667,00:21:25.375,He won't stay anywhere near these islands.
00:21:25.417,00:21:30.125,They call the islands-- ¿Las Cinco Muertes?
00:21:30.166,00:21:32.083,What-- What does that mean?
00:21:34.125,00:21:37.166,"The Five Deaths, he says."
00:21:52.834,00:21:57.125,"I built a location sensor into Dr. Harding's satellite phone, so we should be getting a reading."
00:21:57.166,00:21:59.625,I'm so relieved.
00:21:59.667,00:22:04.750,Our dot is almost on top of her dot.
00:22:04.792,00:22:06.542,Over-- Over there.
00:22:19.875,00:22:21.291,Sarah!
00:22:21.333,00:22:23.875,Sarah!
00:22:23.917,00:22:26.000,Sarah Harding!
00:22:26.041,00:22:29.000,How many Sarahs do you think are on this island?
00:22:29.041,00:22:30.834,Sarah!
00:22:29.041,00:22:42.709,Sa-- What?
00:22:42.750,00:22:45.375,Something big.
00:22:57.083,00:23:00.166,Whoa! Yikes!
00:23:00.208,00:23:02.291,Wow!
00:23:14.750,00:23:18.959,This is-- This is magnificent.
00:23:19.000,00:23:22.709,"Oh, yeah. Ooh, ahh."
00:23:22.750,00:23:25.834,But then later there's running and then... screaming.
00:23:27.125,00:23:29.333,Wow.
00:23:50.667,00:23:53.166,"Hey, Nick!"
00:23:55.417,00:23:57.709,I guess you kinda got the jump on us a bit.
00:23:57.750,00:23:59.750,Yeah.
00:24:03.208,00:24:07.125,"Ian, I never thought in a million years Hammond would get you to come here."
00:24:09.917,00:24:12.417,"Hi, Eddie!"
00:24:12.458,00:24:16.417,Got a granola bar or something?
00:24:16.458,00:24:19.625,"Those animals that walked by, did you see 'em?"
00:24:19.667,00:24:24.000,"It was a family group-- a pair-bond and a sub-adult, long after the juvenile was nest bound."
00:24:24.041,00:24:27.000,Every egg clutch I've seen has got shells crushed and trampled.
00:24:27.041,00:24:30.000,The hatchlings definitely stay in the birth environment for an extended period of time.
00:24:30.041,00:24:34.709,"That's conclusive. I could put that controversy to rest, if I can get a shot of the nest."
00:24:34.750,00:24:38.583,You haven't been attacked?
00:24:38.625,00:24:40.959,That's how it always looks.
00:24:42.333,00:24:44.834,Okay. Sarah-- Is that a Nikon?
00:24:44.875,00:24:47.625,"Yeah, it's a Nikon."
00:24:47.667,00:24:50.083,"I'll be right back, baby."
00:24:52.542,00:24:57.625,"Sarah, when Hammond called you, why didn't you say something to me?"
00:24:57.667,00:25:00.208,Because I knew you would've stopped me from coming.
00:25:00.250,00:25:02.417,"I would've tied you to the bed, right."
00:25:02.458,00:25:06.000,I figured out how the animals survive without lysine.
00:25:06.041,00:25:12.709,"If you look at the diets of the herbivore species that are thriving, they eat mostly agama beans, soy, anything lysine-rich."
00:25:12.750,00:25:20.583,"And the carnivores eat the herbivores, so-- Wait. Wait. Shh, shh, shh."
00:25:20.625,00:25:25.083,Just stay there.
00:25:26.125,00:25:28.125,Stay there.
00:25:56.083,00:25:59.375,Sarah.
00:25:59.417,00:26:01.500,She's much too close.
00:26:01.542,00:26:03.458,Too close.
00:26:24.583,00:26:28.125,"Look, she has to touch it."
00:26:28.166,00:26:31.083,She can't not touch.
00:26:31.125,00:26:43.625,"Once she sees something, she's gotta-- Wow. Is this even possible?"
00:26:45.583,00:26:48.166,What?
00:26:48.208,00:26:50.000,This? What did you think you were going to document?
00:26:50.041,00:26:53.709,What did you think you were going to see?
00:26:53.750,00:26:57.041,"Maybe, uh..."
00:26:59.959,00:27:02.166,Fruitcakes.
00:27:10.500,00:27:13.583,They get very angry when you run out of film.
00:27:13.625,00:27:16.750,Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!
00:27:20.125,00:27:22.000,Sarah!
00:27:22.041,00:27:24.125,Shoot 'em!
00:27:24.166,00:27:27.959,They're just protecting their baby.
00:27:48.458,00:27:50.208,They're leaving.
00:27:58.792,00:28:02.250,"These images are incredible, legendary."
00:28:02.291,00:28:03.834,Wow.
00:28:02.291,00:28:05.250,"Guys shoot their whole life, they never get stuff half this good."
00:28:05.291,00:28:07.750,"You can give me the Pulitzer right now, today, please."
00:28:07.792,00:28:11.000,Wow.
00:28:11.041,00:28:14.000,I'd like to thank everybody who lost.
00:28:14.041,00:28:19.125,"Dinosaurs can pick up scents from miles away. We're here to document, not interact."
00:28:19.166,00:28:21.458,"Which, by the way, is a scientific impossibility."
00:28:21.500,00:28:25.375,"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Whatever you study, you also change."
00:28:25.417,00:28:29.250,"Well, I'll risk it."
00:28:29.291,00:28:32.125,and making assumptions and deductions...
00:28:32.166,00:28:35.417,about the nurturing habits of animals that have been dead for 65 million years.
00:28:35.458,00:28:38.750,"I'm sick of it, man."
00:28:38.792,00:28:41.000,Of course I'm gonna come down here.
00:28:41.041,00:28:44.000,Stories of mutilation and death.
00:28:44.041,00:28:46.000,Don't treat me like a grad student.
00:28:46.041,00:28:52.250,"I've worked around predators since I was 20-- lions, jackals, hyenas, you."
00:28:59.000,00:29:01.291,Shit.
00:29:01.333,00:29:04.417,I'm trying to change a hundred years of entrenched dogma.
00:29:04.458,00:29:08.417,Dinosaurs were characterized very early on as vicious lizards.
00:29:08.458,00:29:11.542,There's a great deal of resistance to the idea of them as nurturing parents.
00:29:11.583,00:29:14.500,Robert Burke said that the T. rex was a rogue...
00:29:14.542,00:29:16.542,who would abandon its young at the earliest opportunity.
00:29:16.583,00:29:18.792,I can prove otherwise.
00:29:18.834,00:29:22.500,"Fire! Dr. Malcolm, fire!"
00:29:27.250,00:29:30.834,No! Water makes smoke billow. Use dirt.
00:29:30.875,00:29:34.000,Who started a fire?
00:29:34.041,00:29:37.000,I just wanted to make dinner.
00:29:37.041,00:29:40.959,I wanted it ready when you guys got back. Yeah.
00:29:42.375,00:29:45.875,Do you see any family resemblance here?
00:29:45.917,00:29:49.500,You practically told me to come here.
00:29:49.542,00:29:52.000,"You said to me, Don't listen to me."
00:29:52.041,00:29:54.750,"I thought you were trying to tell me something or-- Kelly, Kelly."
00:29:54.792,00:29:57.166,You knew exactly what I was talking about.
00:29:54.792,00:30:00.417,You have no idea-- You want to lock her up for curiosity?
00:30:00.458,00:30:02.000,"Thank you, Sarah."
00:30:02.041,00:30:06.709,Don't start the teaming-up thing about this.
00:30:06.750,00:30:10.000,Out of the conversation.
00:30:10.041,00:30:12.000,Eddie!
00:30:12.041,00:30:16.875,Why in the hell doesn't this thing ever work?
00:30:16.917,00:30:19.917,You're not in a phone booth.
00:30:19.959,00:30:21.125,Signal.
00:30:22.917,00:30:27.291,"Violence and technology, not good bedfellows."
00:30:27.333,00:30:29.500,The kind of documentation Hammond wants...
00:30:29.542,00:30:32.875,puts you and your equipment in the field as close to the animals as is safely possible.
00:30:32.917,00:30:36.041,"And while you're at it, why don't you smear yourself with a little sheep's blood?"
00:30:36.083,00:30:40.583,"Eddie, is there any reason to think that the radio in the trailer might work?"
00:30:40.625,00:30:42.375,Don't tease me.
00:30:42.417,00:30:47.000,"If you feel qualified at all, you might try flicking the switch to on."
00:30:47.041,00:30:50.542,"Okay. Listen, I'm taking my daughter outta here."
00:30:50.583,00:30:53.417,"Anybody who wants to come with me, this is your last chance to get out."
00:30:53.458,00:31:00.875,"So when you're out in the field, nothing we can do can leave any room-- Nick, if you're staying, I'd be happy to deliver a letter to your wife or loved one."
00:31:00.917,00:31:03.667,Give you a chance to say good-bye to her.
00:31:03.709,00:31:06.542,Got any personal effects of any kind?
00:31:06.583,00:31:09.000,The least I can do.
00:31:09.041,00:31:11.625,Our presence needs to be 100% antiseptic.
00:31:11.667,00:31:15.000,"If we so much as bend a blade of grass-- Dad, are you mad?"
00:31:15.041,00:31:17.041,I'm not mad.
00:31:19.000,00:31:21.709,What is this?
00:31:21.750,00:31:23.125,Right now!
00:31:24.583,00:31:26.125,What is this?
00:31:26.166,00:31:29.000,There's a hundred switches!
00:31:29.041,00:31:34.375,I was gonna call you to let you know where I was.
00:31:34.417,00:31:39.083,Come on. I'm the best kind of girlfriend there is: one who travels a lot.
00:31:39.125,00:31:41.041,"You like that, right?"
00:31:41.083,00:31:45.959,"I've gotten used to being apart, but that doesn't mean that's how I want to live."
00:31:46.000,00:31:49.375,"You know, Kelly, this is, um, tall talk."
00:31:49.417,00:31:54.750,Just for a minute.
00:31:54.792,00:32:00.000,"If you wanted to rescue me from something, why didn't you bail me out of that fund-raiser at the museum three weeks ago..."
00:32:00.041,00:32:02.000,like you said you would?
00:32:02.041,00:32:05.000,"Uh, this is a slightly different situation."
00:32:05.041,00:32:09.000,Or why not rescue me from that dinner with your parents that you never showed up for?
00:32:09.041,00:32:14.417,Why not rescue me when I really need it-- be there when you say you will?
00:32:14.458,00:32:18.125,I have made a career out of waiting for you.
00:32:18.166,00:32:22.709,Sarah has a pretty good poi-- It's so important to your future that you not finish that sentence.
00:32:22.750,00:32:26.750,Please give us privacy.
00:32:26.792,00:32:29.250,"Ian, come on."
00:32:31.750,00:32:34.709,I love that you rode in here on a white horse.
00:32:34.750,00:32:37.000,I really do.
00:32:37.041,00:32:40.959,"It's very touching, very dramatic."
00:32:41.000,00:32:43.750,I just need you to show up in a cab every once in a while too.
00:32:43.792,00:32:46.625,"Kelly, what are you doing?"
00:32:46.667,00:32:50.250,It's not safe.
00:32:54.583,00:32:56.917,Okay.
00:32:56.959,00:32:59.542,I know what I'm doing.
00:32:59.583,00:33:04.000,"You guys should definitely go, but I'm gonna stay."
00:33:04.041,00:33:08.834,I love you. I just don't need you right now.
00:33:08.875,00:33:12.333,I'll tell you what you need: a good antipsychotic.
00:33:12.375,00:33:14.583,I'll be back in five or six days.
00:33:14.625,00:33:16.208,"No, you'll be back in five or six pieces."
00:33:16.250,00:33:19.417,What bothers you is that I'm not afraid of this place and you are.
00:33:19.458,00:33:23.333,Of course I am.
00:33:23.375,00:33:26.250,"Hey, what's that sound?"
00:33:35.250,00:33:37.625,Here we go.
00:33:37.667,00:33:40.000,Hello! Over here!
00:33:42.875,00:33:47.709,I don't get that.
00:33:47.750,00:33:51.125,I don't get that.
00:33:52.959,00:33:55.458,"Cut the umbilical, Dad!"
00:33:55.500,00:33:58.709,Doesn't he trust us?
00:34:07.250,00:34:09.792,This is as good a place as any for base camp.
00:34:09.834,00:34:12.417,That's first priority after we're finished.
00:34:12.458,00:34:16.542,I want it up and running in 30 minutes.
00:34:16.583,00:34:19.375,Understood?
00:34:19.417,00:34:23.000,What? Why?
00:34:23.041,00:34:26.875,Carnivores hunt on game trails.
00:34:30.792,00:34:34.583,"Let's find a new spot, shall we? Over and out."
00:34:34.625,00:34:39.041,"Peter, if you want me to run your little camping trip, there are two conditions."
00:34:39.083,00:34:42.291,"Firstly, I'm in charge."
00:34:42.333,00:34:45.000,"All you need to do is sign the checks, tell us we're doing a good job..."
00:34:45.041,00:34:47.000,and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.
00:34:47.041,00:34:50.208,Second condition: my fee.
00:34:50.250,00:34:54.333,All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.
00:34:54.375,00:34:57.333,"A male, a buck only."
00:34:57.375,00:35:00.000,"If you don't like either of those two conditions, you're on your own."
00:35:00.041,00:35:03.375,So go ahead.
00:35:03.417,00:35:05.709,"or in the middle of a rex nest, for all I care."
00:35:05.750,00:35:08.417,But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists...
00:35:08.458,00:35:11.709,"to listen to any more suicidal ideas, okay?"
00:35:13.750,00:35:14.917,Okay!
00:35:20.125,00:35:23.583,"Cycle, break off a stray from the herd and flush him to the right."
00:35:23.625,00:35:26.000,"Snaggers, stay ready."
00:35:26.041,00:35:35.709,"It'll be a-- a-- pachy-- uh, pachya-- Oh, hell. The fat head with the bald spot."
00:36:00.041,00:36:02.125,Stop. Stop!
00:36:03.583,00:36:06.000,Pachycephalosaurus.
00:36:06.041,00:36:09.291,"Huh? No, no, herbivore, late Cretaceous."
00:36:16.750,00:36:19.000,You see that distinctive domed skull?
00:36:19.041,00:36:23.000,Nine inches of solid bone.
00:36:23.041,00:36:26.583,"See, the pachy's neck attaches at the bottom of its skull..."
00:36:26.625,00:36:29.417,"instead of at the back of its head, as with reptiles."
00:36:29.458,00:36:35.875,"When it lowers its head, its neck lines up directly with its backbone, which is perfect for absorbing impact."
00:36:42.083,00:36:45.667,"Snagger, Friar Tuck's on the loose, just about to cross your path."
00:37:52.375,00:38:00.917,"Dieter, get into the outrigger. You're closing in on a ca-- carina-- Say that again."
00:38:00.959,00:38:03.041,The one-- The one with the big red horn.
00:38:03.083,00:38:05.667,The pompadour.
00:38:05.709,00:38:08.458,Take me out.
00:38:23.875,00:38:27.000,"Okay, Carter, reel me in."
00:38:28.917,00:38:31.458,Easy!
00:38:33.625,00:38:36.750,"Not too close, lads."
00:38:36.792,00:38:40.208,Go for the legs.
00:38:56.417,00:38:58.834,Watch it!
00:39:28.291,00:39:31.000,Burke! Come here!
00:39:36.792,00:39:38.625,You recognize this trackway?
00:39:38.667,00:39:41.000,"Yes, I do."
00:39:45.667,00:39:47.041,"Ah, Roland."
00:39:51.125,00:39:53.250,Roland! Hey!
00:39:54.959,00:39:58.041,Where do you think you're going?
00:39:58.083,00:40:00.583,To collect my fee.
00:40:12.875,00:40:15.000,"Oh, my God."
00:40:15.041,00:40:19.625,Procompsognathus triassicus.
00:40:19.667,00:40:21.083,Is it dangerous?
00:40:22.125,00:40:25.166,"Nah, I wouldn't think so."
00:40:25.208,00:40:29.208,"Compys have been presumed to be scavengers, like jackals."
00:40:29.250,00:40:31.750,Gives me the creeps.
00:40:31.792,00:40:35.000,It's like it's not scared.
00:40:35.041,00:40:38.875,There haven't been any visitors to this island. There's no reason for it to fear man.
00:40:44.041,00:40:45.417,Now it does.
00:41:05.709,00:41:08.834,It's the rex nest.
00:41:08.875,00:41:14.375,"Infant's probably only a couple of weeks old, never left the nest."
00:41:18.291,00:41:22.333,"Offspring that young, parents won't leave him alone for too long."
00:41:23.792,00:41:26.959,"Make your blind here, wait for the buck to return."
00:41:27.000,00:41:29.041,No. No.
00:41:29.083,00:41:32.625,"The nest is upwind, and so are we."
00:41:32.667,00:41:38.000,"When he comes back, he's gonna know we're here without us even having a chance."
00:41:38.041,00:41:40.875,The trick is...
00:41:40.917,00:41:44.834,to get him to come where we want him.
00:42:34.542,00:42:38.959,This is why Hammond was in such a hurry to get you here.
00:42:39.000,00:42:41.041,"My God, they are well organized."
00:42:42.333,00:42:44.667,Those are some major-league toys.
00:42:44.709,00:42:47.125,"Eddie, maybe I should ask to use their phone."
00:42:47.166,00:42:49.500,Their dish is bigger than yours.
00:42:49.542,00:42:55.583,"So they actually want to build another park here, after what you said happened on the other island?"
00:42:55.625,00:42:58.917,They're not building anything.
00:42:55.625,00:43:00.709,"They're taking these animals outta here, back to the mainland."
00:43:02.375,00:43:05.917,I think I should tell you guys.
00:43:05.959,00:43:08.917,I thought we'd be finished by the time they got started.
00:43:08.959,00:43:11.125,"In case they weren't, he did send a backup plan."
00:43:11.166,00:43:14.083,- What backup plan?
00:43:15.375,00:43:17.750,"Simply put, InGen is seeking limited partners..."
00:43:17.792,00:43:20.417,to defray some of our expansion costs.
00:43:20.458,00:43:23.750,The prospectus you've been given by the board explicitly details...
00:43:23.792,00:43:26.291,our projected hardware and construction expenses.
00:43:26.333,00:43:32.959,"And as you can see by my two friends here, the software is already fully developed."
00:43:34.667,00:43:38.375,One might say it'd be up and running.
00:43:38.417,00:43:44.959,"In a moment, I'll take you on a stroll through the camp, and you'll see some of the larger and more impressive specimens."
00:43:47.250,00:43:49.542,Wow.
00:44:13.917,00:44:17.959,But you don't bring people halfway around the world to visit a zoo.
00:44:18.000,00:44:20.000,You bring the zoo to them.
00:44:20.041,00:44:22.583,San Diego is the perfect set.
00:44:22.625,00:44:32.125,"People already associate our beautiful city with animal attractions-- San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, San Diego Chargers."
00:45:00.000,00:45:02.709,Mr. Hammond knew this.
00:45:02.750,00:45:09.583,"Before he ever dreamt of an island, he began construction on an amphitheater..."
00:45:09.625,00:45:14.166,very near to where you're sitting right now at the InGen waterfront complex.
00:45:14.208,00:45:17.500,But he abandoned it...
00:45:17.542,00:45:21.125,in favor of something far... grander...
00:45:21.166,00:45:24.667,"and, ultimately, impossible."
00:45:24.709,00:45:33.333,"And so, the facility sits unused, unfinished, when it could be completed and ready to receive visitors in less than a month."
00:45:55.917,00:45:58.333,"Ajay, look out!"
00:46:26.041,00:46:29.041,That's the last time I leave you in charge.
00:46:49.291,00:46:51.709,Nick. Nick.
00:46:51.750,00:46:54.875,"Oh, my God."
00:46:54.917,00:46:57.458,Let's get in the car before they hear us.
00:46:57.500,00:47:00.583,Do you have any idea what that is?
00:47:00.625,00:47:04.166,You're nuts.
00:47:04.208,00:47:07.750,That's it.
00:47:11.667,00:47:14.792,What's going on?
00:47:18.250,00:47:20.208,We're not alone on this island.
00:47:30.208,00:47:32.208,It's not set to the frequency.
00:47:35.709,00:47:37.709,Look here.
00:47:55.125,00:47:57.375,What the hell was that?
00:47:57.417,00:47:59.542,Okay. That's right here.
00:47:59.583,00:48:01.667,Hello.
00:48:01.709,00:48:03.625,"Uh, hola."
00:48:03.667,00:48:06.417,"Enrique, ¿estás con una mujer?"
00:48:06.458,00:48:10.041,It's Ian Malcolm.
00:48:10.083,00:48:12.792,- No. Is this the boat?
00:48:12.834,00:48:14.208,We're on Isla Sorna.
00:48:14.250,00:48:17.667,"We need to talk to the boat, Mar del Plata, ma'am."
00:48:24.792,00:48:27.750,I'll get him.
00:48:27.792,00:48:30.625,That's it.
00:48:30.667,00:48:33.500,"Hurry up, Nick."
00:48:33.542,00:48:36.125,Watch his tail.
00:48:36.166,00:48:38.417,"Enrique, yo necesito ayuda."
00:48:36.166,00:48:41.583,"Me tienes que venir a decir-- Boy, is she mad at you."
00:48:41.625,00:48:44.750,"Ian, no lectures, please."
00:48:44.792,00:48:47.959,"Don't stand up, okay?"
00:48:48.000,00:48:50.000,"Careful. No, no."
00:48:50.041,00:48:52.375,Watch his head.
00:48:52.417,00:48:54.959,"No, no, honey. No."
00:48:55.000,00:48:57.250,Watch his tail.
00:48:57.291,00:49:01.041,He's swinging it all over the place.
00:49:01.083,00:49:03.417,You all right?
00:49:03.458,00:49:05.208,Yeah.
00:49:05.250,00:49:07.917,Okay.
00:49:07.959,00:49:10.542,There you go.
00:49:10.583,00:49:13.834,"Don't get close, honey."
00:49:13.875,00:49:16.417,¿Enrique?
00:49:16.458,00:49:19.000,"No, no."
00:49:19.041,00:49:21.625,Wrong frequency.
00:49:24.667,00:49:28.375,"Nick, don't let him get those things around you."
00:49:28.417,00:49:32.875,Hello.
00:49:32.917,00:49:35.917,Lo más importante.
00:49:35.959,00:49:38.000,"Easy, easy."
00:49:38.041,00:49:41.625,"Please, please come now."
00:49:41.667,00:49:44.709,"Okay, here are the metatarsals."
00:49:44.750,00:49:49.166,And-- That's it.
00:49:49.208,00:49:51.208,"And tibia, fibula."
00:49:51.250,00:49:54.333,"There's the fracture, right above the epiphysis."
00:49:54.375,00:49:56.208,"If we don't set it, this baby's gonna die."
00:49:56.250,00:49:59.000,The fibula won't heal straight.
00:49:59.041,00:50:02.834,He won't be able to run or walk.
00:50:02.875,00:50:05.750,"No, uh, uh, Carlos."
00:50:05.792,00:50:08.333,"Goddamn it, you bastard."
00:50:05.792,00:50:11.208,Listen-- Other animals are gonna hear this.
00:50:11.250,00:50:13.625,"Come in, please."
00:50:13.667,00:50:17.166,"Dad, I gotta get outta here."
00:50:17.208,00:50:18.583,I wanna go someplace else.
00:50:18.625,00:50:21.208,Please. I don't wanna be here.
00:50:21.250,00:50:24.625,"Isn't it safe here, honey?"
00:50:24.667,00:50:28.291,What? Wh-What is it?
00:50:28.333,00:50:30.000,"Information, please."
00:50:30.041,00:50:34.166,You're much happier not knowing.
00:50:34.208,00:50:37.375,There we go.
00:50:37.417,00:50:39.208,There we go.
00:50:39.250,00:50:43.417,I shouldn't have come along.
00:50:43.458,00:50:46.000,Can you set it?
00:50:43.458,00:50:49.875,"Yeah. I just need something temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as he grows."
00:50:49.917,00:50:53.166,Whenever you're ready.
00:50:55.959,00:50:57.417,All right.
00:50:57.458,00:51:00.000,"Eddie, what's the frequency for the boat, by the way?"
00:51:00.041,00:51:03.041,Fifteen trip eight.
00:51:03.083,00:51:06.542,"Okay. Ah, okay, we're high."
00:51:06.583,00:51:09.417,"And this is the safest place you can be, I think."
00:51:09.458,00:51:13.417,Remember what Sarah said before.
00:51:13.458,00:51:17.166,You're just trying to make me feel better. I remember all those stories you told me.
00:51:17.208,00:51:19.583,"Oh, no, no."
00:51:19.625,00:51:22.333,We're in a completely different situation right now.
00:51:32.333,00:51:35.083,"Eddie, is there any way we can communicate with the trailers?"
00:51:39.291,00:51:41.125,He's movin' again.
00:51:41.166,00:51:44.166,We have no idea what his metabolism is.
00:51:44.208,00:51:46.000,We'll put him into respiratory arrest.
00:51:46.041,00:51:49.166,I need your hand.
00:51:49.208,00:51:53.000,No answer.
00:51:53.041,00:51:57.041,Tie this belt around you.
00:51:57.083,00:52:01.709,Stay in here. Come on.
00:52:01.750,00:52:04.291,Hello? Where are you going?
00:52:04.333,00:52:06.250,You don't squeeze at all-- I get the idea.
00:52:06.291,00:52:08.333,"Dad, please stay here."
00:52:08.375,00:52:10.875,"Dad, stay here, please."
00:52:10.917,00:52:13.542,The queen?
00:52:13.583,00:52:17.875,Your inspiration?
00:52:21.250,00:52:24.458,I'm comin' right back.
00:52:24.500,00:52:27.792,But you never keep your word!
00:52:33.458,00:52:35.875,"Personally, I would have squeezed just a little bit harder."
00:52:35.917,00:52:38.000,"Okay, I'm almost finished."
00:52:38.041,00:52:40.000,Damn it.
00:52:40.041,00:52:47.291,Something pliable that I can-- Spit.
00:52:49.959,00:52:51.750,Your gum!
00:53:29.250,00:53:32.000,Get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe.
00:53:32.041,00:53:35.291,"Quick injection of antibiotics, and I can get it out of here."
00:53:40.166,00:53:44.000,"For once in your life, would it kill you to pick it up?"
00:53:44.041,00:53:47.500,Help me get this thing out of here.
00:53:52.083,00:53:54.417,Mommy's very angry.
00:55:11.041,00:55:15.083,"This isn't hunting behavior, Ian."
00:55:16.417,00:55:18.208,They came for their infant.
00:55:18.250,00:55:21.625,Let's not disappoint them.
00:55:23.500,00:55:26.542,"Let me get his head, okay?"
00:55:26.583,00:55:28.542,Careful.
00:55:29.959,00:55:31.625,"Okay, I got him."
00:55:31.667,00:55:34.083,Muzzle off.
00:56:12.792,00:56:17.792,"Yeah, they're, uh, going back to the jungle."
00:56:17.834,00:56:21.333,I know. I see. How's Kelly?
00:56:23.333,00:56:26.166,Hello?
00:56:26.208,00:56:29.500,"Yeah, I'm good."
00:56:29.542,00:56:32.208,Don't move.
00:56:32.250,00:56:34.041,"Yeah, I understand."
00:56:36.792,00:56:38.458,"You know, I beg people to listen to me."
00:56:38.500,00:56:41.000,"I use plain, simple English."
00:56:38.500,00:56:42.458,"I don't have any accent-- Oh, shut up."
00:56:42.500,00:56:44.834,"That should make an interesting chapter in your book, huh?"
00:56:44.875,00:56:50.375,I think that the debate over the parental instincts of a T. rex is now academic.
00:56:56.500,00:56:58.500,Hang on.
00:57:17.375,00:57:19.583,They're pushin' us over the cliff.
00:57:19.625,00:57:21.041,"Oh, my God."
00:57:27.041,00:57:30.333,Come on! Come on!
00:57:30.375,00:57:32.750,Once we're out of here-- Straight into the woods.
00:57:32.792,00:57:36.542,Straight into the woods.
00:57:42.875,00:57:45.083,Hang on to something!
00:57:54.959,00:57:57.208,Ian!
00:58:04.500,00:58:07.041,Sarah!
00:58:10.875,00:58:12.542,Sarah!
00:58:24.458,00:58:27.208,"Oh, God."
00:58:33.458,00:58:35.500,Don't move!
00:58:35.542,00:58:39.333,I'm comin' down for you.
00:58:39.375,00:58:41.041,"Here I come, Sarah."
00:58:49.542,00:58:51.000,Nick!
00:58:51.041,00:58:53.208,"The satellite phone, get it!"
00:58:53.250,00:58:56.166,Okay.
00:59:26.041,00:59:28.125,Gimme your hand.
00:59:28.166,00:59:30.333,Sarah. Sarah.
00:59:30.375,00:59:33.125,"Gimme your hand, honey."
00:59:33.166,00:59:35.583,Heads up!
00:59:47.583,00:59:49.125,Your lucky pack.
00:59:55.000,00:59:57.333,I got her.
01:00:16.458,01:00:18.250,Ian!
01:00:20.542,01:00:21.917,Sarah!
01:00:23.458,01:00:24.834,Nick!
01:00:27.542,01:00:29.583,Nick!
01:00:29.625,01:00:32.125,"- Wait, wait, hold on!"
01:00:32.166,01:00:33.959,I'm comin'!
01:00:34.000,01:00:35.917,Goddamn it!
01:00:39.375,01:00:42.375,I'm comin'!
01:00:42.417,01:00:45.000,Kelly.
01:00:45.041,01:00:47.041,She's okay.
01:00:48.125,01:00:50.208,Who's hurt?
01:00:50.250,01:00:52.917,We need rope!
01:00:52.959,01:00:56.000,Yeah. Three double cheeseburgers with everything.
01:00:56.041,01:00:58.166,And an apple turnover!
01:01:11.333,01:01:13.250,There.
01:01:22.000,01:01:24.417,Come on. Yeah.
01:01:36.542,01:01:40.208,Hold on. Hold on!
01:01:40.250,01:01:43.208,Bring the rope! Let's go.
01:01:43.250,01:01:45.625,I'm comin'.
01:01:45.667,01:01:48.291,"Eddie, you all right?"
01:01:48.333,01:01:51.083,Throw it.
01:01:51.125,01:01:54.083,Good throw.
01:01:56.834,01:01:58.834,"Oh, God, no."
01:01:58.875,01:02:01.875,We're sliding down here!
01:02:07.750,01:02:09.083,Oh.
01:02:14.750,01:02:16.500,Up you go. Up you go.
01:03:35.291,01:03:37.458,Hey. Hey!
01:03:48.083,01:03:50.750,Let's go.
01:03:58.458,01:04:00.125,Come on.
01:04:30.458,01:04:34.000,Increase your rate of climb.
01:05:33.709,01:05:35.375,Come on!
01:05:43.959,01:05:46.667,Goddamn it! Goddamn it!
01:06:55.709,01:06:59.250,Our communication equipment's been destroyed.
01:06:59.291,01:07:06.166,And if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went over the cliff-- They were.
01:07:03.250,01:07:08.333,"then we're stuck here, ladies and gentlemen, and stuck together, thanks to you people."
01:07:08.375,01:07:12.041,"Hey, we came here to watch."
01:07:12.083,01:07:14.291,Ooh.
01:07:14.333,01:07:18.583,Five years of work and 100 miles of electrified fence couldn't prepare the other island.
01:07:18.625,01:07:22.166,You think that Marlboro men would make a difference?
01:07:22.208,01:07:24.166,All you care about is what you can take.
01:07:24.208,01:07:28.208,An extinct animal brought back to life has no rights.
01:07:28.250,01:07:30.917,We patented it.
01:07:30.959,01:07:34.041,Are you looking for a problem?
01:07:34.083,01:07:37.750,"Hey, hey!"
01:07:37.792,01:07:39.667,Come on!
01:07:39.709,01:07:43.625,"I know you. You're that Earth First! bastard, aren't you?"
01:07:43.667,01:07:46.000,Earth First!? What's that?
01:07:46.041,01:07:47.458,We're environmentalists!
01:07:47.500,01:07:49.667,Knock it off!
01:07:49.709,01:07:53.959,"By moving the baby rex into our camp, we may have changed the adults' perceived territory."
01:07:54.000,01:07:57.583,That's why they persisted in destroying the trailers.
01:07:57.625,01:08:00.500,They now feel they have to defend this entire area.
01:08:00.542,01:08:03.208,Move where?
01:08:03.250,01:08:07.250,They're both waiting for an order we have no way to send.
01:08:07.291,01:08:13.709,There's a communication center here at the-- Near the old operations building. Hammond ran everything on geothermal power.
01:08:13.750,01:08:15.750,It was never meant to need replenishing.
01:08:15.792,01:08:19.208,"If we can get here, we can send a radio call for the airlift."
01:08:19.250,01:08:22.333,You got the frequency written down someplace?
01:08:22.375,01:08:25.208,We'll mind those.
01:08:25.250,01:08:28.500,"A day's walk, maybe more."
01:08:30.458,01:08:33.750,That's not the problem.
01:08:33.792,01:08:36.542,What is the problem?
01:08:36.583,01:08:38.208,Velociraptors.
01:08:43.583,01:08:49.208,"Our infrareds show that their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior, which is why we planned to keep to the outer rim."
01:08:49.250,01:08:53.208,Wait a minute.
01:08:53.250,01:08:55.375,A carnivore.
01:08:55.417,01:09:02.000,"About two meters tall, long snout, binocular vision, strong dexterous forearms and killing claws on both feet."
01:09:02.041,01:09:06.709,The rexes may continue to track us if they perceive a threat to themselves or their infant.
01:09:06.750,01:09:10.083,You're wrong.
01:09:10.125,01:09:14.000,Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has got the largest proportional olfactory cavity...
01:09:14.041,01:09:17.417,"of any creature in the fossil record, with the exception of one."
01:09:17.458,01:09:22.291,"Right. Uh, uh, turkey vulture could scent up to 10 miles."
01:09:22.333,01:09:26.458,"Right. This is all very thrilling, but I say we should push on to the village."
01:09:26.500,01:09:29.000,We could head back down to the lagoon.
01:09:29.041,01:09:31.375,And do what?
01:09:31.417,01:09:35.417,next to a heavily used water source and hope your captain comes back.
01:09:35.458,01:09:38.000,He won't do that.
01:09:38.041,01:09:41.458,"We might find some shelter, and we can call for help."
01:09:41.500,01:09:46.000,"Rex just fed, so he won't stalk us for food."
01:09:46.041,01:09:49.333,You might show respect.
01:09:49.375,01:09:53.750,Then his troubles are over.
01:09:53.792,01:09:56.250,"No, only humans do."
01:09:56.291,01:09:59.166,Saddle up!
01:10:16.583,01:10:19.667,"Excuse me, cowboy."
01:10:19.709,01:10:21.250,You want some gum?
01:10:23.458,01:10:27.375,You seem like you have a shred of common sense. What the hell are you doing here?
01:10:29.125,01:10:32.417,Somewhere on this island is the greatest predator that ever lived.
01:10:32.458,01:10:35.417,The second greatest predator must take him down.
01:10:35.458,01:10:38.834,You're gonna use that?
01:10:38.875,01:10:41.542,Let me see it for a second.
01:10:41.583,01:10:44.625,The animal exists on the planet...
01:10:44.667,01:10:49.458,"for the first time in millions of years, and the only way you can express yourself is to kill it."
01:10:49.500,01:10:52.166,Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
01:10:52.208,01:10:55.792,Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
01:10:55.834,01:10:58.500,"When they asked him, they said, Why did you go up there to die?"
01:10:58.542,01:11:01.125,"He said, I didn't."
01:11:06.792,01:11:09.750,I haven't had a chance to wish you luck on your new business venture.
01:11:09.792,01:11:11.875,You're off to a promising start.
01:11:11.917,01:11:14.250,I'm sorry for the loss of your man.
01:11:14.291,01:11:18.750,"It's very easy to criticize someone who generates an idea, assumes all the risk."
01:11:18.792,01:11:22.500,"When you try to sound like Hammond, it comes off like a hustle. It's not your fault."
01:11:22.542,01:11:28.000,"They say talent skips a generation, so I'm sure your kids are gonna be sharp as tacks."
01:11:28.041,01:11:31.458,Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
01:11:31.500,01:11:34.333,Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea...
01:11:34.375,01:11:39.709,"in the long, sad history of bad ideas, and I'm gonna be there when you learn that."
01:11:55.208,01:11:56.583,Let's go.
01:12:13.625,01:12:16.250,Take a break.
01:12:28.291,01:12:30.250,You injured?
01:12:32.041,01:12:35.500,"Oh, no."
01:12:35.542,01:12:38.750,It's not drying in the humidity.
01:12:38.792,01:12:40.667,Uh-huh?
01:12:40.709,01:12:42.583,I'd love to know where we are.
01:12:48.125,01:12:50.125,"Makin' friends with Ahab, huh?"
01:12:59.041,01:13:01.000,There's a bottle.
01:13:05.667,01:13:08.250,"Hey, Carter, I'm goin' to the ladies' room."
01:13:08.291,01:13:11.000,So you wait for me here.
01:13:30.959,01:13:33.250,"Oh, man."
01:14:00.375,01:14:03.667,It's not polite to sneak up on people.
01:14:23.834,01:14:26.208,"Hey, Carter!"
01:14:26.250,01:14:27.625,Where are ya?
01:14:29.709,01:14:34.041,"Hey, Carter!"
01:14:36.375,01:14:38.083,Shit.
01:14:38.125,01:14:42.250,"Hey, Carter, let me hear from you!"
01:14:48.625,01:14:50.417,"Hey, Carter!"
01:15:05.709,01:15:42.208,"Hey, Carter-- Carter!"
01:15:48.542,01:15:50.250,Carter!
01:16:36.000,01:16:38.250,"Hey, Roland!"
01:16:43.291,01:16:45.542,"Okay, break over."
01:16:53.625,01:16:57.166,Carry me.
01:16:57.208,01:16:59.458,Carter.
01:16:59.500,01:17:01.125,Carter.
01:17:10.792,01:17:12.166,"Hey, Carter!"
01:17:14.208,01:17:16.208,Roland!
01:17:22.834,01:17:24.208,Roland!
01:17:26.500,01:17:28.125,Get out!
01:18:07.917,01:18:12.208,"N-No, no, no!"
01:18:28.500,01:18:30.500,When did you last see him?
01:18:30.542,01:18:32.417,"Ten, fifteen minutes."
01:18:34.458,01:18:36.291,Come with me.
01:18:36.333,01:18:40.000,"If he's alive, we'll find him."
01:18:40.041,01:18:44.000,"Ten minutes, you should reach the ridge."
01:18:44.041,01:18:45.458,Miss Harding.
01:18:46.750,01:18:48.500,No one tells the little girl.
01:18:54.125,01:18:57.250,Right.
01:18:59.875,01:19:01.709,"Everybody, up."
01:19:03.709,01:19:05.458,Come on.
01:19:07.041,01:19:09.333,"All right, guys, let's get the hell outta here."
01:19:11.500,01:19:12.875,Yep.
01:19:47.208,01:19:48.583,Roland.
01:20:01.625,01:20:03.375,Did you find him?
01:20:07.417,01:20:10.250,Just the parts they didn't like. Map.
01:20:13.875,01:20:18.166,The operations building is right down in there.
01:20:18.208,01:20:21.000,About a mile and a half from the base of these cliffs.
01:20:21.041,01:20:23.875,How do you know that?
01:20:23.917,01:20:25.792,"Now, the climb down won't be easy."
01:20:27.083,01:20:29.458,We'll let them sleep one more hour.
01:20:31.000,01:20:33.166,And then we hit it.
01:21:23.375,01:21:24.750,"Oh, no."
01:22:41.709,01:22:43.959,What is that?
01:22:44.000,01:22:46.250,Shh. Shh. Shh.
01:22:52.625,01:22:54.750,Shh. Shh. Shh.
01:23:02.083,01:23:04.250,Kelly.
01:23:06.291,01:23:07.667,Kelly. Kelly.
01:23:19.500,01:23:22.709,"Stay down, stay down!"
01:23:28.709,01:23:31.417,"Go, go, go, go!"
01:23:31.458,01:23:35.041,Don't look! Just run!
01:23:48.458,01:23:49.917,Bastard!
01:24:11.834,01:24:14.750,"Go, go, go!"
01:25:28.625,01:25:31.959,"You're moving me forward, son of a bitch!"
01:25:32.000,01:25:34.542,- Get away!
01:25:34.583,01:25:37.250,He can't reach us!
01:25:48.291,01:25:51.583,"Oh, my God!"
01:25:51.625,01:25:55.125,"- Burke, stay back!"
01:26:04.208,01:26:07.333,You're okay.
01:26:07.375,01:26:10.125,It's comin' back!
01:26:13.625,01:26:16.625,Dad!
01:26:16.667,01:26:18.166,Thank you.
01:26:23.500,01:26:26.250,Move!
01:26:30.458,01:26:33.875,Don't go into the long grass!
01:26:33.917,01:26:36.125,Keep going.
01:26:38.750,01:26:40.917,Not into the long grass!
01:26:55.166,01:26:57.875,Keep it movin'!
01:27:02.375,01:27:04.417,Move it up there!
01:27:06.625,01:27:09.083,Move it!
01:27:39.917,01:27:42.250,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey."
01:27:44.375,01:27:46.709,Look at this.
01:27:46.750,01:27:48.834,I think it's Ajay's bag.
01:27:53.917,01:27:55.291,What?
01:28:04.375,01:28:09.250,Go... as fast as you can. Go.
01:28:12.166,01:28:14.000,"Go, go! Go!"
01:28:38.041,01:28:40.709,Ow. Ow!
01:28:40.750,01:28:44.208,I see structures there.
01:28:44.250,01:28:48.792,They say the communication center is in the operations building.
01:28:48.834,01:28:52.000,"So I'll get in there, and I'll send the radio call, all right? See you there."
01:28:52.041,01:28:55.625,Wait for us.
01:28:55.667,01:28:58.625,"Okay, here we come."
01:29:46.333,01:29:49.166,"Oh, man."
01:29:51.625,01:29:54.125,What the hell's that?
01:29:57.375,01:29:58.750,Okay.
01:31:00.458,01:31:02.917,Damn it.
01:31:02.959,01:31:06.500,Be there. Be there.
01:31:06.542,01:31:08.166,Be there.
01:31:08.208,01:31:12.625,C.Q. C.Q.
01:31:12.667,01:31:15.709,Repeating: I'm calling for InGen Operations Harvest Leader...
01:31:15.750,01:31:18.000,seeking InGen Harvest Base.
01:31:18.041,01:31:20.041,"Go ahead, Harvest Leader."
01:31:20.083,01:31:24.291,"The operation has suffered severe casualties, and the survivors are in mortal danger."
01:31:24.333,01:31:26.625,I need you to send rescue immediately.
01:31:26.667,01:32:26.125,"Our coordinates here are, um-- Our coordinates here are nine degrees, 58 minutes north, 85 degrees-- Nick?"
01:32:29.375,01:32:31.125,Nick!
01:32:33.125,01:32:34.500,Nick?
01:32:37.083,01:32:39.250,Nick van Owen?
01:32:43.291,01:32:44.500,Nick?
01:33:03.542,01:33:05.583,Oh!
01:33:07.333,01:33:10.083,"Here, here, here, here, here, here, here."
01:33:10.125,01:33:12.166,"Here, here."
01:33:14.125,01:33:16.667,Go! Go inside!
01:35:17.875,01:35:20.208,Go. Go.
01:35:20.250,01:35:51.625,I'm right behind-- Look out! Ian!
01:35:54.041,01:35:56.500,Up here!
01:36:05.834,01:36:09.166,"Kelly? Kelly, no!"
01:36:40.959,01:36:44.375,The school cut you from the team?
01:36:44.417,01:36:47.709,Get outta here!
01:38:08.083,01:38:10.083,Come on! Let's go!
01:38:12.250,01:38:14.625,"Come on! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
01:38:35.709,01:38:37.625,Let's go! Let's go!
01:38:37.667,01:38:39.291,What about the others?
01:38:39.333,01:38:41.458,There's another chopper coming!
01:38:59.625,01:39:02.417,It's okay.
01:39:02.458,01:39:06.250,"Well, that's one souvenir they won't be taking with them."
01:39:15.709,01:39:17.834,Find the infant tyrannosaur.
01:39:17.875,01:39:21.041,Roland can show you where the nest is.
01:39:21.083,01:39:25.291,I'll take it directly to the infirmary complex in San Diego.
01:39:25.333,01:39:29.083,And hurry it up.
01:39:31.041,01:39:33.792,"Oh, Roland."
01:39:33.834,01:39:36.458,Roland. Roland.
01:39:36.500,01:39:41.000,You probably saved InGen.
01:39:41.041,01:39:44.583,But this animal and its infant are going to single-handedly bail us out.
01:39:44.625,01:39:46.709,Congratulations.
01:39:46.750,01:39:48.625,You've got your trophy!
01:39:48.667,01:39:51.625,Buck only!
01:39:51.667,01:39:55.625,And everyone on the planet's going to line up to appreciate it and everything you've done.
01:39:57.041,01:39:58.834,What's the matter?
01:39:58.875,01:40:02.250,He didn't make it.
01:40:02.291,01:40:04.625,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:40:04.667,01:40:06.041,"Really, I am."
01:40:08.041,01:40:12.208,"You know, I remember the people that helped me, Roland."
01:40:12.250,01:40:15.250,"There's a job for you at the park in San Diego, if you want it."
01:40:15.291,01:40:17.458,"No, thank you."
01:40:18.667,01:40:21.875,I believe I've spent enough time in the company of death.
01:40:35.417,01:40:36.792,"Oh, my God."
01:41:37.458,01:41:41.000,"Fifteen years ago, John Hammond had a dream."
01:41:41.041,01:41:44.583,"Like John himself, the dream was grand."
01:41:44.625,01:41:49.125,It was bold.
01:41:49.166,01:41:55.208,"Well, half an hour from now, John Hammond's dream, reimagined, will come true."
01:41:55.250,01:42:03.583,For one 100th the cost of building a destination resort thousands of miles away-- Hiya. Is this the Ludlow affair?
01:42:03.625,01:42:06.000,"No, we're on the list."
01:42:06.041,01:42:08.000,This is Dr. Harding.
01:42:08.041,01:42:11.667,We have Mr. Ludlow's test results.
01:42:11.709,01:42:15.000,Tonight we'll christen Jurassic Park San Diego...
01:42:15.041,01:42:20.166,with a mega-attraction that will drive turnstile numbers to rival any theme park in the world.
01:42:24.458,01:42:28.875,I want to thank you for being intrepid enough to turn up in the wee hours of the morning.
01:42:30.417,01:42:33.083,"The ship, it's here."
01:42:33.125,01:42:35.166,It's-- You'd better come along.
01:42:37.500,01:42:38.875,It's so exciting!
01:42:41.083,01:42:43.750,See that lost-looking couple?
01:42:43.792,01:42:46.000,Let them see this up close.
01:42:46.041,01:42:48.583,Let me check.
01:42:48.625,01:42:52.250,And I want a direct line to the Coast Guard right now.
01:42:52.291,01:42:56.583,"Look. That's their transponder signal, Venture 5888."
01:42:56.625,01:43:00.583,"They're headed into port, but I can't raise them."
01:43:00.625,01:43:04.291,"Skipper, S.S. Venture, this is InGen Harbor Master."
01:43:07.750,01:43:11.041,"Skipper, S.S. Venture, you are approaching the breakwater at flank speed."
01:43:11.083,01:43:12.417,Reduce at once. Over.
01:43:19.375,01:43:22.041,Why they stopping us?
01:43:27.583,01:43:30.166,"S.S. Venture, reduce your speed at once."
01:43:30.208,01:43:34.667,"S.S. Venture, this is InGen Harbor Master."
01:43:34.709,01:43:36.709,What's everybody looking at?
01:43:41.125,01:43:43.125,We should've stayed in the damn car.
01:44:36.041,01:44:39.750,"You okay, Mr. Ludlow?"
01:44:45.417,01:44:47.125,Get up this way!
01:44:49.625,01:44:52.333,Go!
01:44:52.375,01:44:54.125,Come on! Two men come with me!
01:45:03.959,01:45:06.208,Lot of damage up top.
01:45:10.000,01:45:13.041,"Oh, my God."
01:45:13.083,01:45:14.458,Where's the crew?
01:45:15.709,01:45:17.041,All over the place.
01:45:27.709,01:45:30.458,I smell a fuel leak!
01:45:30.500,01:45:32.250,Where at?
01:46:06.667,01:46:08.750,Check the cargo hold!
01:46:08.792,01:46:12.125,There may be crew down there!
01:46:20.458,01:46:22.208,"No, no!"
01:46:55.667,01:46:57.458,Now you're John Hammond.
01:46:59.041,01:47:01.208,Go! Don't even look back!
01:47:27.458,01:47:29.500,Why the hell wasn't it tranquilized?
01:47:29.542,01:47:33.000,Roland hit it with two darts of concentrated carfentanil.
01:47:33.041,01:47:35.500,Ten milligrams should've put it into a coma.
01:47:35.542,01:47:38.834,"So we gave it naltrexone to counteract the effects, but we didn't know how much."
01:47:38.875,01:47:41.625,You administered an antagonist without knowing the proper dosage?
01:47:41.667,01:47:44.458,You put the animal in a narcoleptic state.
01:47:44.500,01:47:47.583,We're prepared for this.
01:47:47.625,01:47:51.125,"No, we brought the infant back on the plane. Look."
01:47:52.250,01:47:53.792,Hey!
01:47:56.041,01:47:58.125,Do you have the infant?
01:47:59.583,01:48:01.208,It's safe.
01:48:04.000,01:48:07.709,"Ian, the animal's dehydrated."
01:48:07.750,01:48:10.542,Then it's gonna look for the next thing its body needs.
01:48:10.583,01:48:14.000,All the containment equipment is here. We've gotta get it back to the dock.
01:48:14.041,01:48:16.417,The boat might be seaworthy.
01:48:16.458,01:48:21.750,"When we brought the baby to the trailer, it came. No reason to think it won't do the same."
01:48:24.166,01:48:25.542,Yep.
01:48:27.458,01:48:29.208,Where's the infant?
01:48:32.041,01:48:34.375,It's in a secured facility. Why?
01:48:37.458,01:48:39.041,Where's the facility?
01:50:04.208,01:50:06.709,There's a dinosaur in our backyard.
01:50:13.000,01:50:17.041,"Benjamin, what are you doing?"
01:50:17.083,01:50:20.208,Wha-- What?
01:50:20.250,01:50:22.166,What?
01:50:22.208,01:50:25.333,No. You tell me-- You always tell me no.
01:50:25.375,01:50:27.417,"No, no. Dear, I will tell you exactly what it is."
01:50:27.458,01:50:29.625,You have to serve him dinner.
01:50:29.667,01:50:33.875,It's the stupid fish tank!
01:50:33.917,01:50:36.333,Then put something over it.
01:50:36.375,01:50:40.417,It isn't. It isn't.
01:50:36.375,01:51:02.917,Just turn it off and-- Slow down.
01:51:25.625,01:51:27.250,There it is.
01:51:33.125,01:51:35.166,He's sedated.
01:51:37.125,01:51:40.166,Really heavily.
01:51:43.583,01:51:49.000,"Hey, when the adult sees it's us once again with his baby, uh, isn't he gonna be like, You?"
01:51:49.041,01:51:54.625,"You know. There may be some, uh, angry recognition."
01:51:54.667,01:51:58.500,Who knows? He may be just happy to see us.
01:51:58.542,01:52:00.625,Hey! What the hell do you think you're doin'?
01:52:02.709,01:52:04.875,We're takin' the kid.
01:52:04.917,01:52:07.959,"If you really wanna stop us, shoot us."
01:52:09.583,01:52:13.083,How will we find the adult?
01:52:23.875,01:52:25.458,Go! Go!
01:52:36.959,01:52:41.458,Get to the other side of the bus!
01:53:33.208,01:53:35.750,"There, there, there."
01:53:50.250,01:53:53.417,He's too drugged.
01:53:53.458,01:53:57.208,Come on. Wake up. Come on.
01:54:03.875,01:54:06.250,He knows.
01:54:19.583,01:54:22.542,"Yeah. Ian, slow down a little."
01:54:22.583,01:54:26.417,Uh... I don't think so.
01:54:46.458,01:54:50.250,This guy's almost fully awake.
01:54:50.291,01:54:53.834,Yeah. The waterfront's right on the other side of these warehouses.
01:54:53.875,01:54:57.834,- Is there any way through?
01:55:03.542,01:55:04.917,There we go.
01:55:07.291,01:55:09.208,You have to follow me now.
01:55:09.250,01:55:12.083,Here we go.
01:55:12.125,01:55:15.417,"Yep, yep. There we go."
01:55:15.458,01:55:17.959,Where's the rex?
01:55:26.041,01:55:27.333,There's the water!
01:55:27.375,01:55:30.083,Shoot it. Shoot it.
01:55:34.250,01:55:37.458,"No, no, you idiot, the adult."
01:55:37.500,01:55:39.250,I want the baby back alive!
01:56:08.875,01:56:10.208,Dr. Malcolm!
01:56:12.208,01:56:14.917,What have you done with it?
01:56:46.375,01:56:48.208,Are you there?
01:57:17.625,01:57:20.375,Oh. There you are.
01:57:38.792,01:57:41.875,Wait. Wait. Wait.
01:57:41.917,01:57:44.500,Wait. Wait.
01:57:44.542,01:57:48.000,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
01:57:52.667,01:57:54.417,Wait!
01:57:57.166,01:59:54.417,"Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wai-- There's a really first-rate shot of the deck of the ship..."
01:59:54.458,02:00:02.000,"and the cargo hold that, for the moment anyway, contains the animal itself, presumably with the infant alongside."
02:00:02.041,02:00:06.417,"Now, by our calculations, they should be nearing the halfway point of this trip."
02:00:06.458,02:00:09.417,"Jim, can you still hear me there?"
02:00:09.458,02:00:12.709,"Yes, I can, Bernard. We are, in fact, halfway to the island."
02:00:12.750,02:00:16.291,It is 206 nautical miles from our present location.
02:00:16.333,02:00:21.000,"The ship is moving at about 20 knots, which will put it in about 11:30 a.m., Eastern time."
02:00:21.041,02:00:25.000,One of the navy's primary concerns through all of this has been safety.
02:00:25.041,02:00:33.041,"And if we take another look around the ever-growing escort around the ship, they are taking no chances of a repeat of the San Diego incident."
02:00:33.083,02:00:35.166,Okay. We're going to take a moment here...
02:00:35.208,02:00:39.333,and run the tape of our interview earlier today with John Hammond.
02:00:39.375,02:00:51.166,"He's the former head of InGen Bioengineering, the man who has come forward to spearhead this movement, not only to return these animals to their island but to keep the island itself intact."
02:00:51.208,02:00:55.208,It is absolutely imperative...
02:00:55.250,02:00:59.500,that we work with the Costa Rican Department of Biological Preserves...
02:00:59.542,02:01:02.542,to establish a set of rules...
02:01:02.583,02:01:06.917,for the preservation and isolation of that island.
02:01:07.667,02:01:10.333,These creatures...
02:01:10.375,02:01:15.041,"require our absence to survive, not our help."
02:01:15.083,02:01:18.083,And if we could only step aside...
02:01:19.959,02:01:25.583,"and trust in nature, life will find a way."
