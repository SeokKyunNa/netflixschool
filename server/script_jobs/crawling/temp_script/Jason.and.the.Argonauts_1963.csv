00:02:23.936,00:02:32.069,"Zeus, king of the gods of the Greeks, write in the ashes so that I may read the future."
00:02:35.530,00:02:37.074,I see...
00:02:38.366,00:02:42.329,a great tree at the end of the world.
00:02:42.370,00:02:47.001,And in its branches there hang the skull and the skin of a ram.
00:02:47.042,00:02:53.381,"They gleam and shine, for it is a prize of the gods, a Golden Fleece."
00:02:53.423,00:02:56.093,We've no time for riddles and mysteries.
00:03:01.098,00:03:05.144,"Pelias, you will conquer tonight."
00:03:05.184,00:03:07.813,You will overthrow the kingdom of Thessaly.
00:03:07.855,00:03:11.483,"You will kill the king Aristo, and wear his crown."
00:03:11.525,00:03:16.363,"You will do all these things without fear or wound, because Zeus commands it."
00:03:16.404,00:03:21.200,"If I'm protected by Zeus, I will have no need of this."
00:03:21.242,00:03:24.245,I will lay it on the fire as a thank-offering to the gods.
00:03:24.872,00:03:37.759,"Pelias, it is also foretold that although you will win the throne of Aristo, you will, when Zeus ordains, lose it to one of Aristo's children."
00:03:41.388,00:03:43.473,Then Aristo will have no children.
00:03:43.515,00:03:45.100,"He has three, Pelias."
00:03:45.142,00:03:51.690,"Two daughters, Philomela and Briseis, and a son, Jason."
00:03:51.732,00:03:55.027,Then two daughters and a son will die with their father tonight.
00:05:08.475,00:05:13.063,"Hera, queen of gods, protect this child, my sister Philomela."
00:05:13.105,00:05:17.609,"And if I, Briseis, am worthy, take me into your protection."
00:05:43.927,00:05:46.513,"Are you Briseis, the daughter of Aristo?"
00:05:46.554,00:05:48.682,Be silent. She is praying.
00:05:51.350,00:05:54.855,For her sister and for her murdered father Aristo.
00:05:56.355,00:05:57.649,Are you a priestess?
00:05:57.691,00:05:59.400,I serve the gods.
00:05:59.442,00:06:03.322,"Then tell me, has Briseis called upon the goddess Hera?"
00:06:03.362,00:06:04.865,She has.
00:06:04.906,00:06:07.366,And has the goddess heard her prayer?
00:06:10.078,00:06:11.370,Then pray for me.
00:06:16.793,00:06:18.962,It is the will of Zeus.
00:06:19.004,00:06:22.423,It is not the will of Zeus.
00:06:22.465,00:06:24.843,Zeus has given you a kingdom.
00:06:24.885,00:06:26.553,The rest will be your own doing.
00:06:32.517,00:06:35.020,"The gods abandon you, Pelias."
00:06:35.062,00:06:40.192,"A one-sandaled man shall come, and no God shall protect you from him."
00:06:41.151,00:06:43.945,A one-sandaled man?
00:06:43.987,00:06:46.823,The child who has escaped you.
00:06:51.995,00:06:54.539,Then why was I not told the whole prophecy?
00:06:55.999,00:07:02.005,"Why did Zeus drive me to kill this girl, when the only one I needed to kill was Jason?"
00:07:02.047,00:07:04.883,Zeus cannot drive men to do what you have done.
00:07:04.925,00:07:12.599,"Men drive themselves to do such things that the gods may know them, and that men may understand themselves."
00:07:12.640,00:07:15.269,The killing of Jason would do you no good.
00:07:17.812,00:07:20.357,Kill Jason and you kill yourself.
00:07:40.585,00:07:46.174,"Zeus, my godly husband, did you, for some reason order the profanation of my temple in Thessaly?"
00:07:46.216,00:07:48.676,That was entirely the thought of Pelias.
00:07:48.718,00:07:54.308,"Not content with winning the throne of Thessaly, as I wished, he tried to avoid losing it, as I have commanded."
00:07:59.229,00:08:01.522,"I know that you've been insulted, my dear."
00:08:02.774,00:08:05.819,But be content.
00:08:05.860,00:08:07.112,He will avenge you.
00:08:07.154,00:08:08.863,How?
00:08:08.905,00:08:17.122,"You must know by now I never arrange exact and precise details-- And because you are neither exact nor precise, a young girl was killed and my temple was profaned."
00:08:20.250,00:08:21.626,I want to help Jason.
00:08:22.085,00:08:23.711,No.
00:08:23.753,00:08:26.131,"You may help the infant, Philomela, if you wish."
00:08:26.173,00:08:27.924,The rest is man's work.
00:08:27.966,00:08:30.344,No. I want to help Jason.
00:08:31.970,00:08:34.514,As you wish.
00:08:34.555,00:08:38.185,How many times did Aristo's daughter Briseis call upon you?
00:08:38.226,00:08:39.269,By name?
00:08:40.520,00:08:41.813,Five.
00:08:41.855,00:08:44.649,"Well, then you can help her brother five times."
00:08:44.691,00:08:48.903,Five times only you can help him to overthrow Pelias.
00:08:48.945,00:08:50.697,And that is my final word.
00:08:52.324,00:08:55.035,It will be 20 years before Jason becomes a man.
00:08:55.076,00:09:01.416,"Oh, an instant of time here on Mount Olympus, but a long 20 years for King Pelias."
00:09:05.628,00:09:08.589,He cautiously travels the roads of Thessaly.
00:09:08.631,00:09:15.555,"Yes, Pelias, you have had years of watching and waiting for the man who must come to kill you."
00:09:16.348,00:09:18.225,The man with one sandal.
00:10:32.507,00:10:34.551,I owe you my life.
00:10:34.593,00:10:36.595,That was as good a way to ford a river as any.
00:10:36.636,00:10:38.555,But I seem to have lost a sandal in doing it.
00:10:39.931,00:10:41.349,Where are you traveling?
00:10:41.391,00:10:43.310,To the palace of the king.
00:10:43.351,00:10:45.186,-Pelias?
00:10:46.521,00:10:48.231,Then I can put you on your way.
00:10:51.359,00:10:54.862,"But first, you must accept the hospitality of my camp."
00:10:54.904,00:10:55.947,Come.
00:11:25.143,00:11:26.353,Be seated.
00:11:51.878,00:11:53.880,You have not yet told me your name.
00:11:53.921,00:11:58.051,"I am Jason, the lawful king of Thessaly."
00:11:58.092,00:12:01.720,One of my father's soldiers brought me up in exile.
00:12:01.762,00:12:04.224,Now I've returned to claim my kingdom.
00:12:04.265,00:12:07.185,I have waited for you for 20 years.
00:12:07.227,00:12:13.900,"And in that 20 years, Pelias has turned my kingdom from the pride of Greece to a savage, evil land."
00:12:13.941,00:12:15.402,I shall need your help.
00:12:15.443,00:12:20.240,"When your father defended his throne, no man fought harder than I."
00:12:20.281,00:12:22.158,This time it will not be enough to fight.
00:12:23.076,00:12:24.536,I could fight.
00:12:24.578,00:12:27.205,I could find Pelias and kill him.
00:12:27.247,00:12:29.249,But the people need more than a leader.
00:12:29.290,00:12:31.292,They must believe the gods have not deserted them.
00:12:32.751,00:12:34.087,They need a miracle.
00:12:34.128,00:12:36.214,And where will you find this miracle?
00:12:36.256,00:12:41.302,I have heard there is a tree at the end of the world with a fleece of gold hanging in its branches.
00:12:41.344,00:12:42.970,"I have heard this, too."
00:12:43.638,00:12:45.265,So have many men.
00:12:45.306,00:12:47.726,They say it is a gift of the gods.
00:12:47.766,00:12:52.855,"It has the power to heal, bring peace, rid the land of plague and famine."
00:12:52.897,00:13:00.154,"If I could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly, then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule."
00:13:00.196,00:13:02.198,They would know that the gods have not abandoned them.
00:13:02.240,00:13:07.746,"My land would be rich and strong again, as it was before this tyrant, Pelias, murdered my father."
00:13:08.455,00:13:11.291,"Jason, be advised by me."
00:13:12.626,00:13:14.711,"First, search for this Golden Fleece."
00:13:14.753,00:13:22.801,"Do not reveal yourself to Pelias, but build a ship and find a crew, and when you have this prize, then and only then..."
00:13:23.553,00:13:25.639,return and kill Pelias.
00:13:33.354,00:13:34.731,And now rest yourself.
00:13:36.107,00:13:37.942,My companions are yours to command.
00:13:44.865,00:13:48.244,"Father, why do you let him live?"
00:13:48.286,00:13:52.290,"If I destroy him, Acastus, I destroy myself."
00:13:53.625,00:13:59.422,"While he is searching for the Golden Fleece, he is at the ends of the earth and I am safe."
00:13:59.464,00:14:00.674,And if he finds it?
00:14:03.468,00:14:04.843,You will be there.
00:14:14.937,00:14:17.607,"Have you come to pray to the gods, Jason?"
00:14:18.857,00:14:21.611,"If I had, I wouldn't have chosen a fallen one."
00:14:23.196,00:14:24.739,Only a statue.
00:14:26.282,00:14:29.410,Sometimes the gods argue amongst themselves.
00:14:29.452,00:14:32.497,Then great winds blow and temples fall.
00:14:33.790,00:14:36.417,-Hermes.
00:14:36.459,00:14:40.004,"No, I said the statue was the God Hermes."
00:14:42.590,00:14:45.051,-Hermes.
00:14:45.092,00:14:48.095,A bringer of dreams and a prowler of the night.
00:14:50.181,00:14:51.391,Jason.
00:14:57.731,00:14:59.940,No man can tell you how to find the fleece.
00:15:01.442,00:15:03.653,Is it not time you asked the gods?
00:15:05.154,00:15:07.948,They will not answer those who believe in them.
00:15:07.990,00:15:10.076,Why should they answer one who doesn't?
00:15:12.453,00:15:13.830,Come with me.
00:15:15.623,00:15:16.708,Why?
00:15:18.209,00:15:23.047,So that you will believe and be answered.
00:16:46.339,00:16:48.215,"You win, my Lord."
00:16:48.257,00:16:52.011,"That is, the battle, not the war."
00:16:55.389,00:16:58.852,"Oh, those waters are far too shallow for galleys."
00:16:58.893,00:17:02.647,"Hera, my dear, you really must learn to win without cheating."
00:17:02.689,00:17:04.607,Or at least to lose gracefully.
00:17:16.243,00:17:18.955,"-Greetings, Hermes."
00:17:20.206,00:17:21.791,There seems to be a piece missing.
00:17:21.833,00:17:23.209,Perhaps I can help.
00:17:32.886,00:17:34.679,"Welcome to Olympus, Jason."
00:17:40.351,00:17:42.020,Ah.
00:17:42.061,00:17:45.398,Jason come to Mount Olympus at last.
00:17:45.439,00:17:49.318,No man calls upon the gods unless he wants something.
00:17:49.360,00:17:52.780,We arranged for you to be brought here by Hermes.
00:17:52.822,00:17:58.578,"I wouldn't have believed a mortal could ask the help of the gods, much less visit them."
00:17:59.579,00:18:02.582,"Well, at least you're honest."
00:18:02.623,00:18:04.918,Which is more than I can say for most other mortals.
00:18:06.293,00:18:07.712,What is it you want?
00:18:08.337,00:18:10.882,A ship? A crew?
00:18:10.924,00:18:13.968,No. Those I can find myself.
00:18:14.010,00:18:15.344,Oh.
00:18:15.386,00:18:17.764,And what are you going to use in place of gold?
00:18:18.347,00:18:19.766,The hearts of men.
00:18:19.807,00:18:24.020,"I am Hera, queen of the gods and your protector on this voyage."
00:18:24.062,00:18:29.108,But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit to the number of times I may help you when you call upon me.
00:18:29.149,00:18:30.610,Do not speak now.
00:18:30.651,00:18:32.403,I know what you must ask of me.
00:18:32.445,00:18:36.323,Does the Golden Fleece exist?
00:18:36.365,00:18:37.909,That's two questions.
00:18:37.951,00:18:39.953,And I shall help him with only one answer.
00:18:41.161,00:18:42.789,Search in the land of Colchis.
00:18:43.998,00:18:45.374,Then it does exist.
00:18:47.251,00:18:48.920,But Colchis...
00:18:48.962,00:18:50.630,That's the end of the world.
00:18:50.671,00:18:52.172,No Greek has ever sailed there.
00:18:52.214,00:18:56.761,"Now that you've heard that, are you so sure that you will not need my help?"
00:18:58.137,00:18:59.472,Think carefully.
00:19:01.223,00:19:02.516,I offered him a ship.
00:19:03.643,00:19:05.311,A ship and a crew.
00:19:06.604,00:19:08.773,And he refused me.
00:19:08.815,00:19:10.650,Refused the help of the gods?
00:19:16.155,00:19:20.660,What ship is strong enough to reach to the edge of the world?
00:19:20.701,00:19:23.830,What crew brave enough to sail in her?
00:19:23.871,00:19:28.835,I shall tell the shipbuilders of Greece that the richest cargo in the world waits in Colchis.
00:19:28.876,00:19:30.920,The Golden Fleece is worth a kingdom.
00:19:30.962,00:19:35.133,And I shall say that only the strongest ship ever built will survive the voyage.
00:19:35.174,00:19:37.802,The athletes of Greece are proud.
00:19:37.844,00:19:41.806,I'll tell them only the best can expect a place on the most perilous voyage in history.
00:19:42.640,00:19:47.561,"I shall announce a games, invite the strongest and bravest of the Greeks."
00:19:47.603,00:19:52.274,"No greater games shall ever be held, unless the gods decree otherwise."
00:19:56.362,00:19:58.447,"I did well to choose you, Jason."
00:19:59.406,00:20:03.452,The gods are best served by those who want their help least.
00:20:08.749,00:20:10.168,"Welcome, Polydeuces."
00:20:12.837,00:20:14.463,Castor of Sparta.
00:20:19.052,00:20:21.220,Acastus of Thessaly.
00:20:29.187,00:20:30.855,"Well done, Acastus."
00:20:30.897,00:20:35.568,"Thelayrus of Athens, champion archer of Greece."
00:20:35.609,00:20:38.571,Euphemus of Taenarum.
00:20:38.612,00:20:40.907,Spyros of Syracuse.
00:20:40.948,00:20:42.783,Hercules!
00:20:42.825,00:20:44.744,He's here!
00:20:56.881,00:20:58.883,"I mean to sail with you, Jason."
00:20:58.925,00:21:01.677,Tell me which champion you want me to beat.
00:21:01.719,00:21:05.848,No one.
00:21:05.890,00:21:08.601,Hercules. Yes.
00:21:11.395,00:21:12.897,Hercules?
00:21:12.939,00:21:14.148,Yes.
00:21:14.190,00:21:15.942,My name is Hylas.
00:21:15.983,00:21:19.319,"Like you, I came too late to compete in the games."
00:21:19.361,00:21:25.201,"But it occurs to me that if I can beat you at something, Jason couldn't refuse me a place on the ship either."
00:21:27.954,00:21:32.750,"After all, he might need brains as well as brawn."
00:21:35.502,00:21:36.796,Shall we compete?
00:21:41.842,00:21:42.927,Discus?
00:21:48.182,00:21:49.516,Come on.
00:21:55.606,00:21:56.983,See that rock?
00:21:58.442,00:22:01.279,No thrower has ever reached it.
00:22:01.320,00:22:04.240,And is the contest to hit it or pass it?
00:22:09.078,00:22:11.038,You'll be lucky if you get halfway.
00:22:11.080,00:22:13.791,"-Now, go on."
00:22:13.833,00:22:16.418,I've never thrown a discus before.
00:22:16.460,00:22:18.420,I'd like to see how it's done.
00:22:57.375,00:23:00.796,Let Hylas have his moment of triumph while he may.
00:23:01.964,00:23:04.300,"You shall have your place, Hylas."
00:23:04.342,00:23:06.426,Hail Hylas!
00:23:06.468,00:23:09.805,I have found the finest crew in all Greece.
00:23:09.847,00:23:12.099,Now for a ship that is worthy of them.
00:23:19.940,00:23:21.108,Argos.
00:23:22.818,00:23:24.486,-Argos.
00:23:25.363,00:23:27.114,"Is that you, Argos?"
00:23:31.077,00:23:32.536,Come aboard.
00:23:52.223,00:23:54.058,Oh.
00:23:54.100,00:23:55.726,So you've come back again.
00:23:55.768,00:23:57.061,She's a fine ship.
00:23:58.396,00:23:59.521,Yes.
00:24:01.315,00:24:04.777,She is a fine ship.
00:24:04.818,00:24:06.653,We've yet to give her a name.
00:24:06.695,00:24:09.489,"I'll call her the Argo, after her builder."
00:24:10.532,00:24:13.119,The... The Argo?
00:24:15.246,00:24:18.207,"Well, you'd better have a look at the figurehead."
00:24:18.249,00:24:19.875,It might make you change your mind.
00:24:19.917,00:24:21.168,"No, this way."
00:24:22.086,00:24:24.630,Is it forward?
00:24:24.671,00:24:26.173,We'll have to move it.
00:24:26.215,00:24:29.093,A figurehead is supposed to watch ahead of the vessel.
00:24:29.135,00:24:33.264,I can't help that.
00:24:40.146,00:24:42.773,"Hera, queen of the gods."
00:24:43.149,00:24:44.482,What?
00:24:45.276,00:24:46.944,Nothing.
00:24:46.986,00:24:48.237,You don't object to it here?
00:24:49.571,00:24:50.906,No.
00:24:50.948,00:24:52.366,Nor do I.
00:24:52.408,00:24:55.953,It makes me feel someone friendly is watching over us.
00:24:58.705,00:25:02.376,-When do we sail?
00:26:35.593,00:26:37.012,Don't waste it.
00:26:37.054,00:26:39.432,"There isn't enough left to make any difference, Jason."
00:26:39.473,00:26:41.559,"Oh, let him rest."
00:26:41.599,00:26:45.271,But the sooner we find some island with water the better.
00:26:45.312,00:26:47.731,We can't row much longer on three sips a day.
00:26:47.773,00:26:50.650,Take my advice.
00:26:50.692,00:26:52.945,But we'd lose five days' sailing.
00:26:52.986,00:26:57.116,"We haven't water enough for tomorrow, let alone the time it would take us to reach Icos."
00:26:57.157,00:27:01.245,"Don't worry, Hylas. I don't expect him to take my advice."
00:27:01.287,00:27:02.996,But I wish he'd listen to someone.
00:27:14.550,00:27:15.675,Still grumbling?
00:27:17.719,00:27:20.139,Sailors always grumble.
00:27:20.180,00:27:21.848,These sailors have something to grumble about.
00:27:22.975,00:27:25.269,Hardly any water.
00:27:25.311,00:27:27.645,-They should use brine.
00:27:27.687,00:27:29.982,It toughens the skin.
00:27:30.023,00:27:31.900,"Well, go down and treat them. I'll steer."
00:27:42.035,00:27:43.036,Hera.
00:27:45.623,00:27:48.041,You said you could help me a certain number of times.
00:27:49.293,00:27:51.378,"So far, you've told me of Colchis."
00:27:51.420,00:27:54.923,And I threw Pelias from his horse and dragged him beneath the water.
00:27:54.965,00:27:56.258,Pelias?
00:27:58.552,00:28:00.678,So that was King Pelias.
00:28:00.720,00:28:04.016,I know your need.
00:28:04.057,00:28:05.725,You will reach land at noon.
00:28:05.767,00:28:08.979,-Where?
00:28:09.021,00:28:10.814,I've never heard of it.
00:28:10.856,00:28:14.193,No mortal has. It was the foundry of the gods.
00:28:14.234,00:28:17.863,"Hephaestus labored there, making armor and weapons for Zeus."
00:28:17.904,00:28:21.825,"Oh, do not fear."
00:28:21.867,00:28:24.744,I will see that you reach the Isle of Bronze.
00:28:24.786,00:28:27.873,"But listen to me, Jason."
00:28:38.925,00:28:40.636,-Take the helm.
00:28:42.304,00:28:43.514,Set sail.
00:28:53.357,00:28:55.192,We reach land at noon.
00:28:55.234,00:28:58.529,Then you can fill your bellies until they grumble as much as your tongues.
00:28:58.571,00:29:00.280,"Now, mark this."
00:29:00.322,00:29:02.741,It will be safe to take food and water.
00:29:02.782,00:29:06.537,But nothing else.
00:29:06.579,00:29:10.082,That doesn't include women?
00:29:10.123,00:29:12.668,"If there are any, yes, it does."
00:29:12.710,00:29:18.965,"If I meet a girl with a firm leg, a full bosom, and a warm heart, let no man try and stop me."
00:29:19.007,00:29:22.052,-Talos will.
00:29:22.094,00:29:24.263,You do mean there's a man there who wants a fight?
00:29:24.304,00:29:26.098,I spoke of no man.
00:29:26.139,00:29:28.726,"Food and water, Hercules."
00:29:31.186,00:29:34.106,"Jason, who told you of this island?"
00:29:34.898,00:29:37.067,The goddess Hera.
00:30:07.806,00:30:09.391,Port helm.
00:30:10.976,00:30:12.060,Steady as you go.
00:30:13.353,00:30:14.730,Furl the sail.
00:30:43.925,00:30:45.302,Ashore for food and water.
00:30:58.482,00:31:00.693,Are goats good sailors?
00:31:00.734,00:31:02.444,Goats? What are you talking about?
00:31:02.486,00:31:04.571,What do you want with goats onboard ship?
00:31:04.613,00:31:06.323,"Well, some of us might be hungry..."
00:31:07.449,00:31:08.659,or thirsty.
00:31:10.202,00:31:11.244,Come on.
00:31:20.796,00:31:22.047,Here's one for the pot.
00:31:30.723,00:31:31.931,Hercules.
00:31:52.911,00:31:55.038,Isn't he one of the Titans?
00:31:55.080,00:31:57.957,He might be.
00:32:01.587,00:32:04.297,Didn't Jason say something about Talos?
00:32:15.350,00:32:19.104,This must be where Hephaestus molded the statues of the gods.
00:32:19.145,00:32:22.941,Yes. And set them up for all the world to see.
00:32:42.335,00:32:43.587,Hercules.
00:33:22.167,00:33:23.836,It's a treasure chamber.
00:33:25.170,00:33:27.297,The treasure chamber of the gods.
00:33:32.302,00:33:33.428,Look at this.
00:33:34.429,00:33:35.639,And this.
00:33:36.765,00:33:38.141,A pearl.
00:33:38.183,00:33:39.810,It's a javelin.
00:33:39.852,00:33:42.395,Don't be silly.
00:33:42.437,00:33:45.064,It's a brooch pin.
00:33:45.106,00:33:47.985,"Well, whatever it is, it'll make a useful weapon."
00:33:48.026,00:33:49.778,Let's get back to the ship.
00:33:49.820,00:33:53.239,Hercules.
00:33:53.281,00:33:56.075,You'd better put it back.
00:33:56.117,00:33:59.705,-Remember what Jason said?
00:34:01.373,00:34:06.336,"Anyway, if the gods leave all this lying about unguarded, they obviously don't want it. Come on."
00:34:55.260,00:34:56.511,It must have been the wind.
00:35:47.520,00:35:49.188,And you saw nothing of them after that?
00:35:51.149,00:35:53.819,Perhaps Hercules found a woman after all.
00:36:02.535,00:36:04.037,Talos.
00:37:58.193,00:38:01.696,-Back water.
00:38:01.738,00:38:02.989,Back.
00:39:38.918,00:39:42.421,"I warned you, Jason."
00:39:42.463,00:39:44.841,Talos will try to kill all of you.
00:39:45.508,00:39:46.926,How can I fight him?
00:39:46.968,00:39:49.888,Think before you waste the gift of the gods.
00:39:49.929,00:39:52.765,"Against a man of bronze, our weapons are useless."
00:39:52.807,00:39:54.475,I repeat that question.
00:39:54.517,00:39:56.144,Then I must answer it.
00:39:56.186,00:39:59.605,Fight Talos with your wits rather than your courage.
00:39:59.647,00:40:01.733,And look to his ankles.
00:40:02.650,00:40:04.194,His ankles?
00:40:04.236,00:40:06.196,There is nothing else I can tell you.
00:40:55.370,00:40:57.038,Jason.
00:40:57.080,00:40:58.706,You disobeyed my order.
00:41:13.054,00:41:15.932,"Lure him to these rocks, but stay out of reach."
00:41:15.974,00:41:18.684,-And what will you do?
00:41:18.726,00:41:20.895,"I shall do my very best to send him to you, Jason."
00:41:21.604,00:41:22.897,My very best.
00:42:39.391,00:42:41.059,Mind his foot!
00:44:31.336,00:44:33.379,"Quick, get back to the rocks."
00:44:40.428,00:44:41.387,Hylas.
00:44:46.309,00:46:06.097,"Hercules, you've left your-- -Well?"
00:46:07.515,00:46:09.517,And I will search again.
00:46:09.559,00:46:13.396,Hylas was with us.
00:46:13.438,00:46:16.566,But then he disappeared.
00:46:16.608,00:46:19.902,"He could've been hurt, not able to get back to the ship."
00:46:19.944,00:46:22.071,Like Palinuros.
00:46:24.990,00:46:27.368,"Hercules, Hylas is dead."
00:46:30.413,00:46:31.706,The gods decided it.
00:46:33.541,00:46:36.127,Why kill a boy for my grave fault?
00:46:38.337,00:46:41.048,But I should have stayed with him.
00:46:41.090,00:46:44.427,Search until nightfall.
00:46:53.102,00:46:55.521,"Sail when you please, Jason."
00:46:55.563,00:46:58.274,I cannot leave this island till I've found Hylas.
00:47:17.876,00:47:19.962,Jason.
00:47:20.004,00:47:23.924,"Will you abandon Hercules, the best man among us?"
00:47:23.966,00:47:26.260,"I, for one, won't sail without him."
00:47:26.302,00:47:27.804,Nor shall I.
00:47:31.098,00:47:32.308,Come with me.
00:47:32.350,00:47:35.436,Hylas!
00:47:46.447,00:47:48.616,Is there any man here who does not obey the gods?
00:47:50.909,00:47:53.120,We will do as the goddess Hera commands...
00:47:54.330,00:47:55.540,if she will speak to us.
00:48:00.712,00:48:02.505,"This is your last chance, Jason."
00:48:09.178,00:48:11.138,The last time that I can help you.
00:48:12.014,00:48:13.224,I understand.
00:48:14.141,00:48:16.060,"Then know this, Argonauts."
00:48:16.101,00:48:18.771,-Hylas is dead.
00:48:18.813,00:48:22.650,Hercules is not fated to go further with the Argo.
00:48:22.692,00:48:24.736,Zeus has other tasks for him.
00:48:24.777,00:48:27.071,"And for us, Hera?"
00:48:27.112,00:48:31.534,"Sail to Phrygia. Seek out Phineas, the blinded man."
00:48:31.576,00:48:33.661,Only he can guide you now.
00:48:38.040,00:48:39.375,We set sail.
00:48:43.170,00:48:46.215,"Come on, back to your places."
00:48:49.677,00:48:52.847,Back to your places.
00:50:27.859,00:50:29.193,Go away!
00:50:32.571,00:50:35.324,Devils! Demons!
00:51:10.484,00:51:13.237,Devils! Demons!
00:51:42.934,00:51:46.645,"Lord Zeus, I was a sinner."
00:51:46.687,00:51:48.981,I've never tried to deny it.
00:51:50.524,00:51:52.902,But I didn't sin every day.
00:51:54.779,00:51:57.865,"Why, then, do you punish me every day?"
00:52:16.884,00:52:18.552,What in the name of the gods are they?
00:52:47.331,00:52:49.875,-Are you Phineas?
00:52:49.917,00:52:52.294,Take my arm.
00:52:52.336,00:52:53.545,Don't flinch.
00:52:57.299,00:53:03.555,"Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy, but I misused it, so I was blinded."
00:53:03.597,00:53:06.142,Zeus ordered the Harpies to torment me.
00:53:07.392,00:53:10.437,"You, Jason, now listen to me."
00:53:11.563,00:53:15.151,The gods have ordered me to tell you whatever you want to know.
00:53:16.360,00:53:19.113,But the gods have gone too far with me.
00:53:19.155,00:53:24.118,"They can punish a man so much, and then one day he abandons them."
00:53:24.160,00:53:26.162,"He says, All right, Zeus."
00:53:26.202,00:53:29.707,Throw a thunderbolt.
00:53:29.748,00:53:31.667,I defy you.
00:53:34.753,00:53:37.882,"You growl away all you like, Zeus."
00:53:37.923,00:53:40.258,I mean what I say.
00:53:41.426,00:53:45.890,"I'll tell you what you want to know, only if you'll meet my price."
00:53:46.598,00:53:48.433,What is your price then?
00:53:48.475,00:53:51.603,Free me from these tormenting Harpies.
00:53:51.645,00:53:55.066,"If Zeus sent those creatures to plague him, we'd be unwise to interfere."
00:53:55.733,00:53:57.735,That's my price.
00:53:57.776,00:53:59.820,"Then we'll meet it, Phineas."
00:53:59.862,00:54:02.073,We'll make you the master of the Harpies.
00:56:28.886,00:56:30.221,Get to the ropes!
00:56:40.689,00:56:42.066,Now.
00:56:59.708,00:57:02.044,Castor. Phalerus.
00:57:02.086,00:57:03.795,Find some wood to build a cage.
00:57:13.180,00:57:15.307,"Here you are, you hungry fellow."
00:57:15.349,00:57:17.309,A big fish for you and some more wine.
00:57:21.605,00:57:25.067,"Well, Phineas, we've completed our part of the bargain."
00:57:25.109,00:57:28.279,-What is it you want to know?
00:57:28.320,00:57:31.240,The way to Colchis is through the Clashing Rocks.
00:57:31.282,00:57:34.326,Steer northwest and you'll reach them in five days.
00:57:34.368,00:57:35.911,"Northwest, eh?"
00:57:35.953,00:57:38.496,"After the Clashing Rocks, you turn northeast."
00:57:38.538,00:57:41.625,"Before long, you'll sight the shores of Colchis."
00:57:41.666,00:57:43.543,"But tell me, what gods protect you?"
00:57:44.711,00:57:46.130,None now.
00:57:47.339,00:57:49.549,Then you won't pass the Clashing Rocks.
00:57:49.591,00:57:51.093,What are the Clashing Rocks?
00:57:51.135,00:57:52.970,"They speak for themselves, don't they?"
00:57:55.347,00:57:57.849,All I can offer you is this.
00:57:57.891,00:58:02.229,"It's not much reward for what you've done, but it's all I have."
00:58:06.942,00:58:09.403,"If that's all you can tell us, then goodbye."
00:58:11.529,00:58:13.490,The gods be merciful to you.
00:58:24.501,00:58:29.547,"Phineas, from now on, they'll witness a banquet every night and eat the scraps you leave."
00:58:34.011,00:58:35.012,Good appetite.
00:59:12.383,00:59:13.884,There's not much water here.
00:59:41.537,00:59:44.122,Steady as you go. Row easy.
00:59:52.839,00:59:54.091,"Easy, all."
00:59:54.925,00:59:57.135,"Easy, all!"
01:00:29.376,01:00:33.464,"It's a narrow channel, but I can't see what made Phineas so frightened."
01:00:33.505,01:00:35.173,It looks calm enough.
01:00:35.966,01:00:37.551,Too calm.
01:00:44.975,01:00:47.352,I know the sea god's moods.
01:00:47.394,01:00:50.981,But most of them are dangerous.
01:00:51.022,01:00:54.359,"Acastus, take a sounding."
01:00:54.401,01:00:57.613,"The rest of you, be prepared to row when I give the word."
01:00:57.654,01:01:00.449,But an easy stroke.
01:01:03.660,01:01:05.370,They may need it later.
01:01:09.207,01:01:11.209,Ship ahoy!
01:01:11.835,01:01:14.129,Ship ahoy!
01:01:15.797,01:01:17.215,There she is.
01:01:19.092,01:01:21.470,She doesn't seem to be in any great difficulty.
01:03:20.422,01:03:22.382,A whole ship's crew.
01:03:22.424,01:03:24.259,And Lynceus from the masthead.
01:03:24.301,01:03:27.679,"There was no hope of saving him, not in that sea."
01:03:28.388,01:03:29.889,Are we going through?
01:03:32.434,01:03:33.685,Yes.
01:03:33.727,01:03:38.398,"But it's-- All right, we're going through."
01:03:39.190,01:03:40.651,Back to your places.
01:03:46.531,01:03:48.199,There's no turning back now.
01:03:48.742,01:03:50.452,"No, Acastus."
01:03:50.494,01:03:52.370,There's no turning back on this voyage.
01:03:52.412,01:03:58.335,"Drummer, beat out the stroke, but keep it easy."
01:04:01.129,01:04:03.298,The gods want their entertainment.
01:04:04.299,01:04:05.967,Jason goes too far.
01:04:06.009,01:04:09.638,Because he speaks the truth when the gods themselves go too far?
01:04:57.394,01:05:00.313,"Turn back, Jason."
01:05:01.022,01:05:02.774,"Trapped, Hera."
01:05:03.608,01:05:05.443,It seems so.
01:05:05.485,01:05:07.529,You've left me only one move.
01:05:17.372,01:05:19.499,"Pray to the gods, Jason."
01:05:19.541,01:05:21.209,The gods of Greece are cruel.
01:05:23.795,01:05:25.922,"In time, all men shall learn to do without them."
01:06:35.032,01:06:38.077,Pull! Pull!
01:06:39.203,01:06:40.413,Get back to your place.
01:06:58.556,01:06:59.850,Pull!
01:06:59.891,01:07:04.729,Pull till your hides crack and your backs break.
01:07:04.771,01:07:06.314,Pull!
01:07:07.106,01:07:08.441,Pull!
01:07:49.649,01:07:51.359,Keep the stroke going.
01:08:08.919,01:08:10.086,Hmm.
01:08:12.839,01:08:18.386,"Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods, and yet you let him live."
01:08:18.428,01:08:23.892,"If I were to punish every blasphemy, I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect."
01:08:23.934,01:08:26.019,You are the god of many men.
01:08:26.061,01:08:30.147,"Yet when those men no longer believe in you, then you'll return to nothing."
01:08:30.189,01:08:34.694,"You understand that, and yet you remain with me."
01:08:34.736,01:08:36.696,"You think it weak of me, my Lord?"
01:08:37.447,01:08:38.573,Not weak.
01:08:39.824,01:08:41.158,Almost human.
01:08:58.259,01:09:02.847,Whichever god or goddess helped us is to be thanked.
01:09:02.889,01:09:04.682,Those others weren't so fortunate.
01:09:04.724,01:09:06.309,What's that?
01:09:48.643,01:09:50.436,Who are you?
01:09:50.478,01:09:51.980,Your ship was lost.
01:09:52.022,01:09:53.439,We found only two other survivors.
01:09:53.481,01:09:55.274,They're being looked after.
01:09:55.316,01:09:56.943,Here. Drink this.
01:10:00.196,01:10:01.739,When did you sail from Colchis?
01:10:02.490,01:10:04.034,"Dawn, this morning."
01:10:04.951,01:10:06.161,Dawn?
01:10:07.411,01:10:08.997,Then our journey is nearly over.
01:10:09.873,01:10:11.374,Where have you come from?
01:10:11.415,01:10:12.876,Thessaly.
01:10:12.917,01:10:14.669,But that's the other side of the world.
01:10:15.628,01:10:17.505,You don't look like a merchant.
01:10:19.924,01:10:22.218,Your vessel's a fighting ship.
01:10:22.259,01:10:23.970,We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.
01:10:25.388,01:10:32.187,"By all accounts, your king, Aeetes, fears the gods, and we were sent by the gods."
01:10:32.228,01:10:35.314,"But I'm gonna talk to him alone, peacefully."
01:10:35.356,01:10:37.025,Now you answer a question.
01:10:37.067,01:10:39.485,What was your ship doing in such dangerous waters?
01:10:39.527,01:10:46.450,"We came to sacrifice to the gods of the rocks, to throw flowers onto the sea to make it safe for our ships."
01:10:46.492,01:10:50.705,"I'm afraid our gods were angry, not so powerful as yours."
01:10:50.747,01:10:52.289,Are you a priestess?
01:10:53.332,01:10:55.710,I serve in the temple of Hecate.
01:10:55.752,01:10:57.670,A dancer.
01:10:57.712,01:11:00.173,Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?
01:11:00.215,01:11:01.465,The goddess.
01:11:01.507,01:11:06.262,"But I'd heard they worship some strange idol, the skull and skin of a ram."
01:11:06.303,01:11:07.764,No ordinary ram.
01:11:07.805,01:11:11.642,Its fleece is of gold.
01:11:07.805,01:11:15.146,"A gift of the gods themselves, and it's brought our city great peace and prosperity."
01:11:15.188,01:11:17.690,We'll put you ashore at dawn tomorrow.
01:11:17.732,01:11:19.483,Perhaps you will show me the way to the city.
01:11:20.860,01:11:23.113,"Now, tell me your name."
01:11:23.905,01:11:25.698,Medea.
01:11:25.740,01:11:28.743,And you can answer my first question.
01:11:28.785,01:11:31.204,-Who are you?
01:11:40.755,01:11:42.590,"Within a few hours, we shall sight Colchis."
01:11:43.674,01:11:46.136,I'm coming in quietly by night.
01:11:46.177,01:11:48.846,"Now the voyage is over, I don't want the trouble to begin."
01:11:48.888,01:11:50.974,"Won't be any trouble, Jason."
01:11:51.015,01:11:53.810,Just tell us where the city is and when we attack.
01:11:53.851,01:11:55.561,We don't attack.
01:11:55.603,01:11:56.938,But that's foolish.
01:11:56.980,01:11:59.315,You have the finest fighting men in the world.
01:11:59.356,01:12:01.276,Forty fighting men against a nation?
01:12:01.358,01:12:03.236,"Better 40 than one, Jason."
01:12:03.278,01:12:04.862,"We're not pirates, Phalerus."
01:12:04.904,01:12:06.489,What's that girl done to you?
01:12:06.530,01:12:09.075,We thought you were a fighting man.
01:12:09.117,01:12:12.162,I'm going up alone in the morning to see what the situation is.
01:12:12.203,01:12:16.166,"Oh, you mean spy out the land."
01:12:16.207,01:12:18.251,Why not take a few of us scouting?
01:12:18.293,01:12:21.504,"The fewer who go, the less can get caught."
01:12:21.545,01:12:22.755,What's the fewest you can think of?
01:12:22.797,01:12:24.257,"One, of course."
01:12:24.299,01:12:26.259,Right. I accept your advice.
01:12:26.301,01:12:28.178,But I don't.
01:12:28.219,01:12:31.097,"Having sailed this far together, I suppose we're free to speak our minds."
01:12:31.139,01:12:33.224,"And what's on yours, Acastus?"
01:12:33.266,01:12:36.352,"We nose our way upstream, trust the gods and seize the fleece."
01:12:36.393,01:12:39.647,We'd be out into the open sea while Aeetes was still asleep.
01:12:39.689,01:12:41.565,-A night attack?
01:12:41.607,01:12:44.861,"And in the dark, during the attack, a man will die."
01:12:44.902,01:12:46.654,That man will be me.
01:12:46.696,01:12:48.072,A javelin in my back.
01:12:48.114,01:12:49.782,"A Greek javelin, Acastus."
01:12:49.824,01:12:51.284,Maybe your javelin.
01:12:51.326,01:12:52.618,"You'll die for that, Jason."
01:12:53.077,01:12:54.411,Keep back.
01:14:09.695,01:14:11.239,Euphemus.
01:14:33.594,01:14:35.888,It's Euphemus. He's dead.
01:14:40.435,01:14:43.813,Look at this.
01:14:45.731,01:14:47.984,Acastus must be at the bottom of the sea.
01:14:48.025,01:14:49.235,I wonder.
01:14:50.194,01:14:52.363,-Make sail.
01:14:52.405,01:14:55.574,The sea was his kingdom while he was alive.
01:14:55.616,01:14:57.576,Let it take his body now he's dead.
01:14:57.618,01:14:59.162,Make sail.
01:14:59.996,01:15:01.497,Make sail!
01:15:07.378,01:15:08.921,You're wounded.
01:15:10.547,01:15:13.217,We have a flower in Colchis which heals and soothes.
01:15:14.718,01:15:16.053,"Tomorrow, I'll show you."
01:15:26.647,01:15:28.149,What do you call the flower?
01:15:28.191,01:15:31.110,It has no name.
01:15:31.152,01:15:33.904,They say it sprang from the blood of Prometheus.
01:15:33.946,01:15:38.075,And it has been used over the years for its soothing and curing powers.
01:15:40.328,01:15:42.913,The sun's getting higher.
01:15:43.914,01:15:45.708,Follow the road to the east.
01:15:45.749,01:15:47.168,You're not coming further?
01:15:47.210,01:15:48.669,I go another way.
01:18:35.794,01:18:39.006,The goddess Hecate has spoken.
01:18:40.550,01:18:45.596,There will be one among us today from the ends of the world.
01:18:47.348,01:18:49.099,His name is Jason.
01:18:50.059,01:18:54.980,Any man of whom he asks his way shall say this.
01:18:55.856,01:19:01.737,"Aeetes, king of Colchis, awaits him in the temple of Hecate."
01:19:02.905,01:19:06.409,And that is all any man shall say to him.
01:19:12.122,01:19:13.249,"Come forward, Jason."
01:19:29.682,01:19:32.476,You have done all of us a great service.
01:19:32.518,01:19:34.937,"Tonight, we shall feast you."
01:19:34.978,01:19:38.482,"We know of your great heroism, and it deserves celebration."
01:19:38.524,01:19:41.736,"Return, then, to your companions and bring them to my palace."
01:19:41.777,01:19:45.740,"I thank you, my Lord, but I do not understand."
01:19:50.244,01:19:52.538,-Medea?
01:20:15.018,01:20:18.897,I give you Jason and the Argonauts.
01:20:18.939,01:20:21.442,Jason and the Argonauts!
01:20:27.323,01:20:30.284,"Tell me, Jason, why did you come to Colchis?"
01:20:31.327,01:20:32.995,In peace.
01:20:33.036,01:20:35.498,"I said why, not how."
01:20:36.624,01:20:38.459,"Altogether, how many men have you?"
01:20:39.168,01:20:40.711,Enough.
01:20:40.753,01:20:43.422,And you say you do not threaten us?
01:20:43.464,01:20:46.467,Envoys who come to me in deceit remain in death.
01:20:47.843,01:20:50.429,I know you've come for the fleece.
01:20:50.471,01:20:54.433,"And I know, too, that if you cannot win it by bargaining, then you plan to steal it."
01:20:54.475,01:20:56.686,"But we'll never part with it, Jason."
01:20:56.727,01:20:59.062,It is a gift of the gods.
01:20:59.104,01:21:01.857,It has brought wealth and peace to Colchis.
01:21:01.898,01:21:07.154,"And should we ever let it go, it would mean plague and famine and the destruction of our country!"
01:21:07.196,01:21:11.450,"We can no longer welcome or entertain you, but treat you as you deserve."
01:21:11.908,01:21:18.666,"As thieves, as pirates, as murderers."
01:21:25.130,01:21:27.800,We give our thanks to one person.
01:21:29.760,01:21:40.437,"The person who exposed a criminal attempt on our kingdom: The son of King Pelias of Thessaly, Acastus."
01:22:12.010,01:22:17.140,"Hecate, queen of darkness, you've always helped me."
01:22:17.182,01:22:19.184,Tell me now what I must do.
01:22:20.352,01:22:27.693,"You, who gave me the gift of foresight, why didn't you reveal to me Acastus' treachery?"
01:22:28.819,01:22:37.745,"He who sits drinking with Aeetes, while Jason, imprisoned, condemned to death."
01:22:39.371,01:22:50.424,"If I help him now in the quest for the fleece, I shall be a traitor to my country and to you, Hecate."
01:22:54.470,01:22:59.934,"And if not, to myself."
01:23:04.271,01:23:06.148,"Help me, Hecate."
01:23:42.893,01:23:44.603,Medea.
01:23:44.645,01:23:47.815,Why did you come here?
01:23:47.857,01:23:52.110,I came to ask you to give up your quest and sail away with the Argonauts in peace.
01:23:53.570,01:23:55.030,Never return.
01:23:55.071,01:23:56.907,Never to think again of the Golden Fleece?
01:23:56.949,01:23:58.617,Never to think of the fleece.
01:23:58.659,01:24:00.870,Then it was Aeetes.
01:24:00.911,01:24:06.834,"You tell him I will fulfill the task the gods have sent me and never betray the Argonauts, whatever he offers me."
01:24:08.460,01:24:11.630,"Even if it's Medea, high priestess of Hecate."
01:24:11.672,01:24:17.970,"Please, forget the Golden Fleece."
01:24:20.931,01:24:26.562,"If you're set on carrying it away, I must come with you."
01:24:27.980,01:24:29.064,I'll go alone.
01:24:30.440,01:24:32.568,No.
01:24:32.609,01:24:35.738,I have to go with you.
01:24:37.698,01:24:39.282,And I love you.
01:24:54.924,01:24:56.759,Shh.
01:24:56.800,01:25:00.095,"Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius, get to the door."
01:25:00.136,01:25:01.680,"The rest of you, back to your places."
01:25:07.477,01:25:09.980,-The priestess.
01:25:10.022,01:25:13.442,"When you're clear of the palace, go back to the ship and row downstream."
01:25:13.483,01:25:16.028,There's a break in the cliff and a path leading through the woods.
01:25:16.070,01:25:17.529,Anchor there. We'll join you.
01:25:36.840,01:25:38.467,"Well, what is it?"
01:25:38.508,01:25:41.344,-Jason has escaped.
01:25:41.386,01:25:42.763,They were all gone.
01:25:42.805,01:25:44.974,I was making my rounds and found the guards drugged.
01:25:45.015,01:25:48.435,Drugged? Then there's an accomplice.
01:25:48.477,01:25:50.729,-Where's Acastus?
01:25:51.438,01:25:54.316,Acastus help Jason?
01:25:54.357,01:25:56.401,But there's no reason to it.
01:25:58.445,01:26:01.073,Unless it was Medea who mixed the drug.
01:26:01.115,01:26:03.325,The high priestess of Hecate?
01:26:03.366,01:26:05.243,I saw how Medea looked at Jason.
01:26:08.371,01:26:14.544,"If Medea's helping them, she's guiding them to the Golden Fleece and the Argonauts will take ship."
01:26:14.586,01:26:16.379,The landward way is shorter.
01:26:16.421,01:26:18.214,"Muster your men, captain."
01:26:53.375,01:26:55.002,Shh. Listen.
01:26:58.421,01:26:59.548,Soldiers.
01:27:00.924,01:27:03.426,"Polaris, Castor, you come with me."
01:27:03.468,01:27:05.179,"-No, not you, Polydeuces."
01:27:03.468,01:27:07.723,"-But, Argos-- You stay aboard with the rest of the men and guard the ship."
01:31:08.130,01:31:09.589,Jason.
01:31:12.759,01:31:15.304,Aeetes and the Colchians.
01:31:15.345,01:31:18.556,We heard them from the ship.
01:31:21.017,01:31:22.311,Get the fleece.
01:32:21.077,01:32:22.829,"Guards, follow them up there and that way."
01:32:26.375,01:32:27.625,Wait.
01:32:39.513,01:32:44.934,"Hecate, queen of darkness, revenge yourself against the Thessalians."
01:32:44.976,01:32:50.857,"Deliver to me the children of the Hydra's teeth, the children of the night."
01:33:36.736,01:33:39.573,The teeth. Fetch me the Hydra's teeth. Quickly.
01:34:06.266,01:34:11.229,"Against the children of the Hydra's teeth, there is no protection."
01:35:04.282,01:35:06.535,The fleece.
01:35:08.620,01:35:10.704,It has the power to heal.
01:35:40.318,01:35:43.446,It's true. It does have the power to heal.
01:36:05.885,01:36:07.345,Jason!
01:36:09.097,01:36:15.019,"Hold the guards back, captain, or they may die, killed with Jason and his pirates."
01:36:38.126,01:36:42.464,"Rise up, you dead, slain of the Hydra."
01:36:42.505,01:36:46.301,Rise from your graves and avenge us.
01:36:46.342,01:36:50.846,Those who steal the Golden Fleece must die.
01:37:25.047,01:37:27.049,"Argos, get down to the ship."
01:37:27.091,01:37:29.260,-Take Medea.
01:37:56.078,01:37:57.539,And there.
01:38:03.002,01:38:04.170,And still another.
01:38:05.921,01:38:07.256,Wait.
01:38:12.804,01:38:14.096,And more.
01:38:39.581,01:38:41.666,Destroy them!
01:38:43.959,01:38:45.420,Kill!
01:38:46.838,01:38:50.258,"Kill, kill, kill them all!"
01:39:54.988,01:39:56.324,Get back.
01:42:41.238,01:42:44.492,"I think that proves at last that I'm a worthy opponent, my Lord."
01:42:44.533,01:42:45.910,Where are you going?
01:42:45.952,01:42:47.495,To clear the board.
01:42:47.536,01:42:48.746,It certainly is not.
01:43:00.591,01:43:06.764,"For the moment let them enjoy a calm sea, a fresh breeze and each other."
01:43:06.806,01:43:10.183,"The girl is pretty, and I was always sentimental."
01:43:11.686,01:43:15.815,"But for Jason, there are other adventures."
01:43:15.857,01:43:17.817,I have not yet finished with Jason.
01:43:19.443,01:43:22.279,Let us continue the game another day.
