00:01:12.333,00:01:15.250,MY FATHER GAVE ME SOME ADVICE.
00:01:17.375,00:01:21.709,"ALWAYS TRY TO SEE THE BEST IN PEOPLE, HE WOULD SAY."
00:01:23.041,00:01:29.542,"AS A CONSEQUENCE, I'M INCLINED TO RESERVE ALL JUDGMENTS."
00:01:29.583,00:01:33.458,BUT EVEN I HAVE A LIMIT.
00:01:35.542,00:01:41.166,BACK THEN ALL OF US DRANK TOO MUCH.
00:01:41.208,00:01:48.500,THE MORE IN TUNE WITH THE TIMES WE WERE THE MORE WE DRANK.
00:01:48.542,00:01:54.500,AND NONE OF US CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING NEW.
00:01:54.542,00:01:58.875,WHEN I CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK I WAS DISGUSTED.
00:02:01.417,00:02:04.041,"Doctor: I SEE, MR. CARRAWAY."
00:02:04.083,00:02:09.667,DISGUSTED WITH EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING.
00:02:09.709,00:02:13.667,ONLY ONE MAN WAS EXEMPT FROM MY DISGUST.
00:02:17.333,00:02:20.208,ONE MAN?
00:02:20.250,00:02:22.709,MR. CARRAWAY?
00:02:25.625,00:02:27.625,GATSBY.
00:02:30.417,00:02:32.834,WAS HE A FRIEND OF YOURS?
00:02:34.667,00:02:37.375,HE WAS...
00:02:37.417,00:02:40.917,THE SINGLE MOST HOPEFUL PERSON I'VE EVER MET.
00:02:42.792,00:02:46.083,AND AM EVER LIKELY TO MEET AGAIN.
00:02:48.166,00:02:51.959,"THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM, A SENSITIVITY."
00:02:52.000,00:03:00.417,"HE WAS LIKE -- HE WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE MACHINES THAT REGISTER EARTHQUAKES 10,000 MILES AWAY."
00:03:00.458,00:03:01.959,WHERE'D YOU MEET HIM?
00:03:07.166,00:03:10.250,AT A -- AT A PARTY...
00:03:10.291,00:03:11.917,IN NEW YORK.
00:03:13.500,00:03:19.583,IN THE SUMMER OF 1922 THE TEMPO OF THE CITY APPROACHED HYSTERIA.
00:03:31.917,00:03:40.542,STOCKS REACHED RECORD PEAKS AND WALL STREET BOOMED IN A STEADY GOLDEN ROAR.
00:03:40.583,00:03:42.125,THE PARTIES WERE BIGGER.
00:03:42.166,00:03:44.709,THE SHOWS WERE BROADER.
00:03:44.750,00:03:47.792,THE BUILDINGS WERE HIGHER.
00:03:47.834,00:03:55.792,"THE MORALS WERE LOOSER AND THE BAN ON ALCOHOL HAD BACKFIRED, MAKING THE LIQUOR CHEAPER."
00:03:59.458,00:04:04.625,WALL STREET WAS LURING THE YOUNG AND AMBITIOUS.
00:04:04.667,00:04:06.125,AND I WAS ONE OF THEM.
00:04:10.250,00:04:13.834,I RENTED A HOUSE 20 MILES FROM THE CITY ON LONG ISLAND.
00:04:13.875,00:04:21.333,I LIVED AT WEST EGG IN A FORGOTTEN GROUNDSKEEPER'S COTTAGE SQUEEZED AMONG THE MANSIONS OF THE NEWLY RICH.
00:04:21.375,00:04:25.834,"TO GET STARTED, I BOUGHT A DOZEN VOLUMES ON CREDIT, BANKING AND INVESTMENTS."
00:04:25.875,00:04:27.625,ALL NEW TO ME.
00:04:27.667,00:04:29.917,Man on radio: THE STOCK MARKET HIT ANOTHER RECORD HIGH.
00:04:29.959,00:04:31.875,"THE MARKET'S MOVING UP, UP, UP!"
00:04:31.917,00:04:33.375,"WELL, OF COURSE, NOTHING IS 100%."
00:04:33.417,00:04:35.208,"WELL, I WOULDN'T GO INVESTING EVERY PENNY."
00:04:35.250,00:04:40.041,AT YALE I DREAMED OF BEING A WRITER BUT I GAVE ALL THAT UP.
00:04:40.083,00:04:47.333,WITH THE SUN SHINING AND THE GREAT BURST OF LEAVES ON THE TREES I PLANNED TO SPEND THE SUMMER STUDYING.
00:04:47.375,00:04:54.667,AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WERE IT NOT FOR THE RIOTOUS AMUSEMENTS THAT BECKONED...
00:04:57.041,00:05:11.083,...FROM BEYOND THE WALLS OF THAT COLOSSAL CASTLE OWNED BY A GENTLEMAN I HAD NOT YET MET NAMED GATSBY.
00:05:11.125,00:05:15.208,Doctor: SO HE WAS YOUR NEIGHBOR.
00:05:15.250,00:05:18.000,MY NEIGHBOR.
00:05:18.041,00:05:19.750,YEAH.
00:05:19.792,00:05:27.959,"WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT, THE HISTORY OF THE SUMMER REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT I DROVE OVER TO MY COUSIN DAISY'S FOR DINNER."
00:05:28.000,00:05:34.041,SHE LIVED ACROSS THE BAY IN OLD MONEYED...
00:05:34.083,00:05:35.917,EAST EGG.
00:05:40.208,00:05:44.000,HER HUSBAND WAS HEIR TO ONE OF AMERICA'S WEALTHIEST FAMILIES.
00:05:45.834,00:05:49.500,HIS NAME WAS TOM BUCHANAN.
00:05:51.500,00:05:54.709,"WHEN WE WERE AT YALE TOGETHER, HE'D BEEN A SPORTING STAR."
00:05:54.750,00:05:58.583,BUT NOW HIS GLORY DAYS WERE BEHIND HIM AND HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH...
00:05:58.625,00:06:00.291,"TELEPHONE, MONSIEUR BUCHANAN."
00:06:00.333,00:06:02.041,MYRTLE: It's me.
00:06:02.083,00:06:04.041,I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME HERE.
00:06:04.083,00:06:06.000,BOAZ!
00:06:06.041,00:06:08.000,SHAKESPEARE!
00:06:08.041,00:06:10.500,OHH!
00:06:10.542,00:06:12.291,HOW'S THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL COMING?
00:06:12.333,00:06:14.625,"OH, I'M SELLING BONDS NOW WITH WALTER CHASE'S OUTFIT."
00:06:14.667,00:06:16.917,"NOW, LET'S SAY AFTER DINNER, YOU AND I, WE GO INTO TOWN."
00:06:16.959,00:06:18.709,CATCH UP WITH THE OLD WOLF PACK.
00:06:18.750,00:06:22.083,BIG DAY ON THE JOB TOMORROW.
00:06:22.125,00:06:24.792,"FIRST TEAM, ALL AMERICAN."
00:06:24.834,00:06:27.291,YOU SEE?
00:06:27.333,00:06:30.291,FOREST HILLS. PLAYED THE PRINCE OF WALES. WHAT A SISSY.
00:06:30.333,00:06:33.208,"LIFE IS SOMETHING YOU DOMINATE, NICK!"
00:06:33.250,00:06:34.250,IF YOU'RE ANY GOOD.
00:06:34.291,00:06:35.667,HA!
00:06:37.709,00:06:39.875,UGH!
00:06:41.417,00:06:42.875,OH.
00:06:59.291,00:07:01.375,Tom: HENRI!
00:07:01.417,00:07:02.834,"Henri: OUI, MONSIEUR."
00:07:02.875,00:07:06.500,THE DOORS.
00:07:06.542,00:07:07.750,ALLEZ.
00:07:07.792,00:07:10.291,SORRY. THANK YOU.
00:07:10.333,00:07:13.792,"Daisy: IS THAT YOU, MY LOVELY?"
00:07:17.041,00:07:20.792,"DAISY BUCHANAN, THE GOLDEN GIRL."
00:07:20.834,00:07:23.125,A BREATHLESS WARMTH FLOWED FROM HER.
00:07:23.166,00:07:27.834,A PROMISE THAT THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD SHE SO WANTED TO SEE.
00:07:27.875,00:07:30.291,DO THEY MISS ME IN CHICAGO?
00:07:30.333,00:07:34.250,"UH, YES. UM, UM, AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE SEND THEIR LOVE."
00:07:34.291,00:07:36.166,HOW GORGEOUS.
00:07:36.208,00:07:38.500,THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY IN MOURNING.
00:07:38.542,00:07:41.208,NO. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
00:07:41.250,00:07:42.667,I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
00:07:42.709,00:07:44.875,"DAISY BUCHANAN, WE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU!"
00:07:44.917,00:07:48.250,I'M PARALYZED WITH HAPPINESS.
00:07:52.166,00:07:57.041,"JORDAN BAKER, A VERY FAMOUS GOLFER."
00:07:57.083,00:08:00.041,SHE WAS THE MOST FRIGHTENING PERSON I'D EVER SEEN.
00:08:00.083,00:08:02.792,"WELL, I'VE -- I'VE SEEN YOUR FACE ON THE COVER OF SPORTING LIFE."
00:08:02.834,00:08:04.458,NICK CARRAWAY.
00:08:04.500,00:08:07.041,BUT I ENJOYED LOOKING AT HER.
00:08:07.083,00:08:10.208,I'VE BEEN LYING ON THAT SOFA FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.
00:08:10.250,00:08:12.458,THIS SUMMER I'LL SORT OF FLING YOU TWO TOGETHER.
00:08:12.500,00:08:15.041,I'LL PUSH YOU INTO LINEN CLOSETS AND OUT TO SEA IN BOATS!
00:08:15.083,00:08:16.667,I'M NOT LISTENING TO A WORD.
00:08:16.709,00:08:23.875,"SO, NICK, DAISY TELLS ME THAT YOU'RE OVER IN WEST EGG THROWING YOUR LOT IN WITH THOSE SOCIAL-CLIMBING, PRIMITIVE NEW-MONEY TYPES."
00:08:23.917,00:08:26.500,MY LITTLE SHACK'S JUST A CARDBOARD BOX AT 80 A MONTH.
00:08:26.542,00:08:28.166,YOUR LIFE IS ADORABLE.
00:08:28.208,00:08:30.041,Jordan: I KNOW SOMEBODY IN WEST EGG.
00:08:30.083,00:08:32.792,I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE PERSON THAT SIDE OF THE BAY.
00:08:32.834,00:08:34.583,OH.
00:08:34.625,00:08:37.083,GATSBY?
00:08:40.166,00:08:42.083,WHAT GATSBY?
00:08:42.125,00:08:44.542,"MADAME, THE DINNER IS SERVI."
00:08:55.959,00:08:58.375,Daisy: WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR A FAMILY SECRET?
00:08:58.417,00:08:59.542,THAT'S WHY I CAME OVER.
00:08:59.583,00:09:00.917,IT'S ABOUT THE BUTLER'S NOSE.
00:09:00.959,00:09:02.333,THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE.
00:09:02.375,00:09:04.583,Tom: I HATE THAT WORD HULKING.
00:09:04.625,00:09:07.166,"NICKY, I HEARD A RUMOR THAT YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED TO A GIRL OUT WEST."
00:09:07.208,00:09:08.709,IT'S A LIBEL.
00:09:08.750,00:09:10.834,THEY HAVE TO BE OLD SO THEY DIE QUICKLY.
00:09:10.875,00:09:13.458,CAN'T WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE? ANYTHING. CROPS.
00:09:13.500,00:09:15.542,"YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL UNCIVILIZED, DAISY."
00:09:15.583,00:09:17.458,Tom: CIVILIZATION'S GOING TO PIECES!
00:09:17.500,00:09:22.834,HAVE YOU READ THE RISE OF THE COLORED EMPIRES BY THIS FELLOW GODDARD?
00:09:22.875,00:09:24.834,EVERYBODY OUGHT TO READ IT.
00:09:24.875,00:09:33.083,"THE IDEA IS THAT IT'S UP TO US, THE DOMINANT RACE TO WATCH OUT OR THESE OTHER RACES WILL HAVE CONTROL OF THINGS."
00:09:33.125,00:09:34.834,TOM'S VERY PROFOUND LATELY.
00:09:34.875,00:09:37.208,HE READS DEEP BOOKS WITH LONG WORDS IN THEM.
00:09:37.250,00:09:39.667,IT'S BEEN PROVED.
00:09:39.709,00:09:41.458,We've got to beat them down.
00:09:49.792,00:09:53.083,Henri: BUCHANAN RESIDENCE.
00:09:53.125,00:09:55.625,"MONSIEUR WILSON, FROM ZE GARAGE."
00:09:55.667,00:09:57.125,MONSIEUR BUCHANAN.
00:09:57.166,00:09:59.583,"EXCUSE ME, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK."
00:10:03.125,00:10:04.667,I'M SORRY.
00:10:06.834,00:10:08.542,WELL...
00:10:08.583,00:10:10.375,"...THIS MR. GATSBY YOU SPOKE OF, HE'S MY NEIGHBOR."
00:10:10.417,00:10:13.208,Shh! DON'T TALK.
00:10:13.250,00:10:14.750,I WANNA HEAR WHAT HAPPENS.
00:10:14.792,00:10:16.542,Daisy: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO OUTSIDE OF THIS HOUSE.
00:10:16.583,00:10:18.333,SOMETHING HAPPENING?
00:10:18.375,00:10:20.291,Daisy: ...IN FRONT OF MY COUSIN.
00:10:20.333,00:10:23.417,Jordan: TOM'S GOT SOME WOMAN IN NEW YORK.
00:10:23.458,00:10:26.250,SHE MIGHT HAVE THE DECENCY NOT TO TELEPHONE AT DINNERTIME.
00:10:26.291,00:10:27.625,DON'T YOU THINK?
00:10:27.667,00:10:29.834,Daisy: IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?
00:10:29.875,00:10:31.709,"Tom: DAISY, DON'T MAKE ANY SCENES."
00:10:31.750,00:10:34.333,"I LOVE SEEING YOU AT MY TABLE, NICKY."
00:10:34.375,00:10:36.792,YOU REMIND ME OF A ROSE.
00:10:36.834,00:10:39.250,Tom: SO AFTER DINNER...
00:10:39.291,00:10:41.250,"...NICK WANTED TO GO INTO TOWN, RIGHT, NICK?"
00:10:41.291,00:10:43.500,TO THE YALE CLUB.
00:10:43.542,00:10:45.333,I HAVE TO WORK EARLY.
00:10:45.375,00:10:47.291,THERE'S SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.
00:10:47.333,00:10:49.417,IT'S JUST FOR A DRINK OR TWO.
00:10:54.125,00:11:00.667,NONE OF US COULD IGNORE THAT FIFTH GUEST'S SHRILL METALLIC URGENCY.
00:11:00.709,00:11:02.750,NICKY.
00:11:02.792,00:11:04.125,WHAT?
00:11:04.166,00:11:08.875,"IT'S JUST, WELL, YOU SEE, I THINK EVERYTHING'S TERRIBLE ANYHOW."
00:11:08.917,00:11:10.709,REALLY?
00:11:10.750,00:11:14.625,I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE AND SEEN EVERYTHING AND DONE EVERYTHING.
00:11:14.667,00:11:17.500,"I'VE HAD A VERY BAD TIME, NICKY."
00:11:17.542,00:11:21.458,I'M PRETTY CYNICAL ABOUT EVERYTHING.
00:11:21.500,00:11:23.000,AH.
00:11:23.041,00:11:27.417,"YOUR DAUGHTER, I SUPPOSE SHE TALKS AND EATS AND EVERYTHING?"
00:11:27.458,00:11:29.583,PAMMY?
00:11:29.625,00:11:31.333,"OH, YES."
00:11:31.375,00:11:34.959,"LISTEN, NICK, WHEN SHE WAS BORN..."
00:11:35.000,00:11:39.166,TOM WAS GOD KNOWS WHERE...
00:11:43.583,00:11:45.750,...WITH GOD KNOWS WHOM.
00:11:45.792,00:11:51.583,AND I ASKED THE NURSE IF IT WAS A BOY OR A GIRL.
00:11:51.625,00:12:00.000,AND SHE SAID IT WAS A GIRL AND I WEPT: I'M GLAD IT'S A GIRL.
00:12:00.041,00:12:02.291,AND I HOPE SHE'LL BE A FOOL.
00:12:02.333,00:12:06.000,THAT'S THE BEST THING A GIRL IN THIS WORLD CAN BE.
00:12:06.041,00:12:09.542,A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FOOL.
00:12:12.625,00:12:17.208,"Daisy: ALL THE BRIGHT, PRECIOUS THINGS FADE SO FAST."
00:12:18.875,00:12:20.875,AND THEY DON'T COME BACK.
00:12:51.792,00:12:59.041,WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I NOTICED THAT A FIGURE HAD EMERGED ON MY NEIGHBOR'S DOCK.
00:13:01.709,00:13:07.709,AND SOMETHING TOLD ME IT WAS MR. GATSBY.
00:13:14.542,00:13:20.125,HE SEEMED TO BE REACHING TOWARD SOMETHING OUT THERE IN THE DARK.
00:13:32.250,00:13:34.959,THE GREEN LIGHT.
00:13:40.250,00:13:42.709,"I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT THIS, DOCTOR."
00:13:42.750,00:13:44.166,THEN WRITE ABOUT IT.
00:13:44.208,00:13:47.041,WRITE ABOUT IT?
00:13:47.083,00:13:49.041,YES.
00:13:49.083,00:13:50.709,WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
00:13:50.750,00:13:54.250,YOU SAID YOURSELF WRITING BROUGHT YOU SOLACE.
00:13:54.291,00:13:59.625,"YEAH, WELL, IT DIDN'T BRING ANYONE ELSE MUCH SOLACE."
00:13:59.667,00:14:01.834,I WASN'T ANY GOOD.
00:14:01.875,00:14:05.583,NO ONE NEED EVER READ IT.
00:14:10.709,00:14:12.458,WHAT WOULD I WRITE ABOUT?
00:14:12.500,00:14:14.250,ANYTHING.
00:14:14.291,00:14:21.375,"WHATEVER BRINGS YOU EASE: A MEMORY, A THOUGHT, A PLACE."
00:14:24.166,00:14:26.500,WRITE IT DOWN.
00:14:29.875,00:14:31.542,A PLACE.
00:14:37.375,00:14:41.125,THE VALLEY OF ASHES WAS A GROTESQUE PLACE.
00:14:42.959,00:15:00.542,NEW YORK'S DUMPING GROUND HALFWAY BETWEEN WEST EGG AND THE CITY WHERE THE BURNT OUT COAL THAT POWERED THE BOOMING GOLDEN CITY WAS DISCARDED BY MEN WHO MOVED DIMLY AND ALREADY CRUMBLING THROUGH THE POWDERY AIR.
00:15:00.583,00:15:13.041,"THIS FANTASTIC FARM WAS EVER WATCHED BY DR. T.J. ECKLEBURG, A FORGOTTEN OCULIST WHOSE EYES BROODED OVER IT ALL LIKE THE EYES OF GOD."
00:15:13.083,00:15:23.542,"TOM HAD INVITED ME TO TOWN, APPARENTLY FOR LUNCH AT THE YALE CLUB, BUT THE DAY TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN."
00:15:23.583,00:15:26.250,COME ON.
00:15:26.291,00:15:27.458,COME ON!
00:15:27.500,00:15:29.208,TRUST ME!
00:15:29.250,00:15:32.041,"Conductor: HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?"
00:15:29.250,00:15:33.667,"TOM, WHAT ARE YOU -- Tom: JUMP!"
00:15:33.709,00:15:35.208,TOM!
00:15:35.250,00:15:40.291,"OH, GOD. TOM, HEY."
00:15:40.333,00:15:43.709,"Tom: DOMINATE, NICK!"

00:30:19.625,00:30:22.000,PLEASE FORGIVE ME.
00:30:22.041,00:30:23.250,I'VE HAD SO MUCH TO DRINK.
00:30:23.291,00:30:24.709,"MR. GATSBY, SIR."
00:30:24.750,00:30:26.291,OH.

00:30:27.834,00:30:30.500,I'M TAKING MY NEW HYDROPLANE OUT IN THE MORNING.
00:30:30.542,00:30:32.291,WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH ME?
00:30:32.333,00:30:34.625,WHAT TIME?
00:30:34.667,00:30:36.125,THE TIME THAT SUITS YOU.
00:30:36.166,00:30:38.792,"WELL, THAT'S VERY KIND OF YOU."
00:30:38.834,00:30:42.375,"LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MISS BAKER."
00:30:42.417,00:30:47.208,"IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT, JUST ASK FOR IT, OLD SPORT."
00:30:50.917,00:30:54.458,EXCUSE ME.
00:30:59.667,00:31:04.500,I EXPECTED HIM TO BE -- Jordan: OLD AND FAT?
00:31:04.542,00:31:10.250,YOUNG MEN DON'T JUST DRIFT COOLLY OUT OF NOWHERE AND BUY A PALACE ON LONG ISLAND.
00:31:11.667,00:31:14.709,HE TOLD ME ONCE HE WAS AN OXFORD MAN.
00:31:14.750,00:31:16.458,"HOWEVER, I DON'T BELIEVE IT."
00:31:16.500,00:31:18.208,WHY NOT?
00:31:18.250,00:31:21.125,I DON'T KNOW. I JUST DON'T BELIEVE HE WENT THERE.
00:31:21.166,00:31:22.917,I BEG YOUR PARDON.
00:31:22.959,00:31:26.041,"MISS BAKER, MR. GATSBY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU."
00:31:26.083,00:31:27.834,ALONE.

00:33:20.208,00:33:21.875,Man: COME ON.
00:33:21.917,00:33:23.000,IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

00:33:25.792,00:33:27.583,COME ON.
00:33:27.625,00:33:29.667,WHAT MAKES SENSE?
00:33:29.709,00:33:31.583,"COME ON, THIS IS CRAZY!"
00:33:31.625,00:33:35.250,"OH, BUT HERE I AM TANTALIZING YOU WHEN I SWORE I WOULDN'T TELL."

00:33:36.625,00:33:38.333,"OH, NICK, I'M SORRY, I SWORE."
00:33:38.375,00:33:40.792,I SWORE I WOULDN'T TELL.
00:33:46.083,00:33:48.792,"SORRY TO KEEP HER FROM YOU, OLD SPORT."
00:33:48.834,00:33:51.333,AH.
00:33:48.834,00:33:53.125,"DON'T FORGET, WE'RE GOING UP IN THAT HYDROPLANE TOMORROW MORNING."
00:33:53.166,00:33:55.500,YES.
00:33:55.542,00:33:58.458,"MR. GATSBY, SIR, PHILADELPHIA ON THE PHONE."
00:34:00.667,00:34:02.375,"NIGHT, OLD SPORT."
00:34:02.417,00:34:04.125,GOOD NIGHT.
00:34:04.166,00:34:05.500,THANK YOU.
00:34:13.166,00:34:14.750,WHAT'S THE MATTER?

00:34:52.875,00:34:55.500,"WELL, WE RODE IN THE HYDROPLANE."
00:34:55.542,00:34:59.000,AND I ATTENDED TWO MORE OF HIS PARTIES.
00:34:59.041,00:35:01.834,EVEN MADE USE OF HIS BEACH.
00:35:01.875,00:35:10.041,"BUT YOU KNOW, DOCTOR, I REALIZED THAT I KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT GATSBY AT ALL."
00:35:10.083,00:35:13.208,UNTIL...
00:35:34.208,00:35:35.750,"IT'S PRETTY, ISN'T IT, OLD SPORT?"
00:35:35.792,00:35:37.291,HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN IT BEFORE?
00:35:37.333,00:35:41.583,IT'S ALL A CUSTOM JOB.
00:35:41.625,00:35:43.917,AH.
00:35:43.959,00:35:45.500,WE'RE GOING TO LUNCH.
00:35:58.000,00:35:59.917,"OH, WELL."
00:35:59.959,00:36:01.667,YEAH.
00:36:01.709,00:36:03.667,"LOOK HERE, OLD SPORT."
00:36:03.709,00:36:06.709,"WHAT -- WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF ME, ANYHOW?"
00:36:06.750,00:36:09.333,MY OPINION?
00:36:11.000,00:36:16.125,I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION FROM ALL THESE -- FROM ALL THESE BIZARRE ACCUSATIONS YOU MUST BE HEARING.
00:36:16.166,00:36:17.959,"A PACK OF LIES, I GUARANTEE YOU."
00:36:18.000,00:36:20.041,YOU'VE HEARD THE STORIES?
00:36:18.000,00:36:22.583,"OH, WELL -- I WILL TELL YOU GOD'S TRUTH."
00:36:22.625,00:36:25.417,I AM THE SON OF SOME VERY WEALTHY PEOPLE FROM THE MIDDLE WEST.
00:36:25.458,00:36:27.375,"SADLY, ALL OF THEM ARE DEAD NOW."
00:36:29.166,00:36:34.208,I WAS BROUGHT UP IN AMERICA BUT EDUCATED AT OXFORD BECAUSE ALL MY ANCESTORS HAVE BEEN EDUCATED THERE FOR MANY YEARS.
00:36:34.250,00:36:35.625,"YOU SEE, IT'S A FAMILY TRADITION."
00:36:35.667,00:36:37.667,THE WAY HE SPOKE!
00:36:37.709,00:36:40.250,NO WONDER PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WAS LYING.
00:36:40.291,00:36:43.250,"AFTER MY FAMILY DIED, I RAN INTO A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY."
00:36:43.291,00:36:47.125,"AFTER THAT, I LIVED LIKE A YOUNG PRINCE IN ALL THE CAPITALS OF EUROPE."
00:36:47.166,00:36:48.375,"OH, EUROPE."
00:36:49.917,00:36:55.125,"PARIS, VENICE, ROME, VIENNA, ZURICH, HELSINKI, MOSCOW, ISTANBUL..."
00:36:55.166,00:37:00.667,"COLLECTING JEWELS, CHIEFLY RUBIES, HUNTING BIG GAME, PAINTING A LITTLE, THINGS FOR MYSELF ONLY."
00:37:00.709,00:37:02.667,TRYING TO FORGET SOMETHING VERY SAD...
00:37:02.709,00:37:06.333,JUST WHEN I THOUGHT IT COULDN'T BE ANY MORE FANTASTICAL...
00:37:06.375,00:37:07.750,"THEN CAME THE WAR, OLD SPORT."
00:37:07.792,00:37:12.291,"...HE BECAME A WAR HERO, SINGLE-HANDEDLY DEFEATING THE GERMAN ARMY."
00:37:12.333,00:37:15.583,"IN THE ARGONNE FOREST, I TOOK TWO MACHINE GUN DETACHMENTS SO FAR..."
00:37:15.625,00:37:17.208,WE WERE OUTNUMBERED 5 TO 1.
00:37:17.250,00:37:18.875,THERE WAS A HALF A MILE GAP ON EITHER SIDE...
00:37:18.917,00:37:20.333,THERE WASN'T A SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER LEFT STANDING.
00:37:20.375,00:37:21.583,SO WE STAYED THERE TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS.
00:37:21.625,00:37:23.667,...SAW WERE PILES OF DEAD.
00:37:23.709,00:37:26.875,130 MEN WITH ONLY 16 LEWIS GUNS.
00:37:26.917,00:37:30.000,EVERY ALLIED GOVERNMENT GAVE ME A MEDAL. EVEN MONTENEGRO.
00:37:31.875,00:37:33.333,HERE.
00:37:33.375,00:37:35.083,THAT'S FROM MONTENEGRO.
00:37:35.125,00:37:37.166,MAJOR JAY GATSBY FOR VALOR EXTRAORDINARY.
00:37:37.208,00:37:39.750,VALOR EXTRAORDINARY.
00:37:39.792,00:37:43.166,"AND THIS IS SOMETHING I ALWAYS CARRY WITH ME, A SOUVENIR OF OXFORD DAYS."
00:37:43.208,00:37:44.792,THAT WAS TAKEN IN TRINITY QUAD.
00:37:44.834,00:37:47.125,THE MAN ON MY LEFT IS NOW THE EARL OF DONCASTER.
00:37:47.166,00:37:49.917,WHAT COULD I SAY?
00:37:49.959,00:37:52.917,THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS UNDOUBTEDLY AUTHENTIC.
00:37:52.959,00:37:54.291,COULD IT ALL BE TRUE?
00:37:54.333,00:37:58.500,"BUT, OF COURSE, YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, OLD SPORT."
00:37:58.542,00:38:04.750,"AT LUNCH TODAY, I'M GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO ONE OF NEW YORK'S MOST DISTINGUISHED BUSINESSMEN, A MR. MEYER WOLFSHIEM, MY GOOD FRIEND."
00:38:04.792,00:38:08.458,AND HE WILL CONFIRM ALL I HAVE TOLD YOU AND VOUCH FOR MY GOOD CHARACTER.
00:38:08.500,00:38:09.750,"OH, I'M SURE THAT'S NOT NECESSARY."
00:38:09.792,00:38:11.792,"OH, BUT IT IS, THOUGH."
00:38:11.834,00:38:13.917,"YOU SEE, I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT MY LIFE."
00:38:13.959,00:38:18.792,"I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK I WAS -- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK I WAS JUST SOME NOBODY."
00:38:18.834,00:38:20.792,NO.
00:38:18.834,00:38:23.583,"YOU SEE, OLD SPORT, I'M -- I'M GOING TO MAKE A VERY BIG REQUEST OF YOU TODAY."
00:38:23.625,00:38:26.291,A BIG REQUEST?
00:38:26.333,00:38:29.625,MISS BAKER WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING WHEN YOU TAKE HER TO TEA THIS AFTERNOON.
00:38:31.125,00:38:33.500,JORDAN?
00:38:33.542,00:38:36.458,"WELL, I ASSURE YOU IT'S NOTHING UNDERHAND."
00:38:36.500,00:38:38.291,MISS BAKER'S AN HONEST SPORTSWOMAN.
00:38:38.333,00:38:39.875,SHE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT WASN'T ALL RIGHT.
00:38:39.917,00:38:42.375,PULL OVER!
00:38:42.417,00:38:46.208,"ALL RIGHT, OLD SPORT."
00:38:49.709,00:38:53.375,"RIGHT YOU ARE! I'LL KNOW YOU NEXT TIME, MR. GATSBY!"
00:38:53.417,00:38:54.500,'SCUSE ME.
00:38:54.542,00:38:57.417,THANK YOU.
00:38:57.458,00:39:00.250,ONE OF YOUR OLD OXFORD PALS?
00:38:57.458,00:39:02.667,"WELL, I WAS -- I WAS ABLE TO DO THE COMMISSIONER A FAVOR ONCE."
00:39:02.709,00:39:06.083,HE SENDS ME A CHRISTMAS CARD EVERY YEAR.
00:39:06.125,00:39:09.125,I IMAGINE HE'LL BE AT LUNCH TOO.
00:39:12.959,00:39:16.750,"BY THE TIME WE REACHED THE BRIDGE, I WAS IMPOSSIBLY CONFUSED."
00:39:28.667,00:39:31.834,I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.
00:39:31.875,00:39:46.792,BUT THE CITY SEEN FROM THE QUEENSBORO BRIDGE IS ALWAYS THE CITY SEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS FIRST WILD PROMISE OF ALL THE MYSTERY AND THE BEAUTY IN THE WORLD.
00:39:46.834,00:39:52.000,"ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN NOW THAT WE'VE SLID OVER THIS BRIDGE, I THOUGHT."
00:39:52.041,00:39:53.917,ANYTHING AT ALL.
00:39:53.959,00:39:57.000,EVEN GATSBY COULD HAPPEN.
00:39:58.375,00:40:00.542,"Man: YES, ABSOLUTELY."

00:41:05.083,00:41:07.417,"HIGHBALLS, MR. GATSBY?"

00:42:33.250,00:42:36.000,"AH. SADLY, ALL DEAD NOW."
00:42:36.041,00:42:45.583,WHEN I FIRST MADE THE PLEASURE OF MR. GATSBY'S ACQUAINTANCE JUST AFTER THE WAR I KNEW I'D DISCOVERED A MAN OF FINE BREEDING.

00:43:00.750,00:43:07.959,"WITH A FRIEND, WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU, HE'D NEVER SO MUCH AS LOOK AT YOUR WIFE."
00:43:08.000,00:43:10.333,I'M NOT MARRIED.
00:43:10.375,00:43:12.792,"BUT YOU WORK ON WALL STREET, RIGHT?"

00:43:43.417,00:43:44.542,WHOO!
00:43:44.583,00:43:46.041,"WHO IS HE, ANYHOW?"
00:43:46.083,00:43:47.333,MEYER?
00:43:47.375,00:43:50.583,"NO, NO."
00:43:50.625,00:43:54.417,HE'S THE MAN WHO FIXED THE 1919 WORLD SERIES.
00:43:54.458,00:43:57.208,FIXED IT?
00:43:57.250,00:43:58.709,"WELL, HOW'D HE MANAGE THAT?"
00:43:58.750,00:44:01.875,"SAW THE OPPORTUNITY, I SUPPOSE."
00:44:01.917,00:44:04.291,HE'S A VERY SMART MAN.
00:44:11.083,00:44:14.041,"Man: OH, WOW!"
00:44:14.083,00:44:18.125,"NOW, OLD SPORT, ABOUT MISS BAKER AND THAT REQUEST WE SPOKE OF."
00:44:18.166,00:44:20.458,Tom: NICK? NICK!
00:44:20.500,00:44:22.333,TOM!
00:44:22.375,00:44:24.333,HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?!
00:44:24.375,00:44:25.875,GOOD.
00:44:25.917,00:44:28.875,DAISY IS FURIOUS THAT YOU HAVEN'T CALLED.
00:44:28.917,00:44:32.750,"HEY, MR. GATSBY, THIS IS MR. BUCHANAN."
00:44:32.792,00:44:35.500,IT'S A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.
00:44:35.542,00:44:36.875,YEAH.
00:44:36.917,00:44:41.792,NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO FIND YOU IN THIS TEMPLE OF VIRTUE.
00:44:41.834,00:44:43.250,"WELL, I WAS JUST HAVING LUNCH WITH MR. GATSBY."
00:44:51.125,00:44:53.083,"Maitre D': CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?"
00:44:53.125,00:44:55.750,"Nick: JORDAN BAKER, THE FAMOUS SPORTING STAR? THE GOLFER?"
00:44:55.792,00:44:58.291,OH. I-I SEE.
00:44:58.333,00:45:00.500,THERE YOU ARE. WHAT KINDA GAME ARE YOU AND GATSBY PLAYING AT?
00:45:00.542,00:45:02.417,THE GENTLEMAN WILL BE JOINING?
00:45:02.458,00:45:04.375,EXCUSE ME. ONE MOMENT.
00:45:04.417,00:45:07.250,"WELL, IT'S ALL RATHER STRANGE. HE PICKS ME UP IN HIS FANCY YELLOW CAR."
00:45:07.291,00:45:09.083,AND HE'S GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HIS LIFE AND THE WAR AND -- PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
00:45:09.125,00:45:14.125,"WHAT IS THIS ENORMOUS REQUEST, JORDAN? PLEASE JUST TELL -- HE WANTS YOU TO INVITE DAISY TO TEA."
00:45:14.166,00:45:17.291,DAISY?
00:45:17.333,00:45:20.542,AND GATSBY.
00:45:20.583,00:45:21.917,WHY?
00:45:21.959,00:45:24.041,I DON'T QUITE KNOW WHERE TO START.
00:45:24.083,00:45:28.792,"YOU SEE, I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL THE OTHER NIGHT THAT I'D MET GATSBY."
00:45:28.834,00:45:30.792,FIVE YEARS AGO.
00:45:30.834,00:45:32.875,IN LOUISVILLE.
00:45:32.917,00:45:36.542,IT WAS THE DAY I GOT MY NEW ENGLISH GOLF SHOES.
00:45:41.125,00:45:45.166,DAISY WAS BY FAR THE MOST POPULAR GIRL WITH THE OFFICERS FROM CAMP TAYLOR.
00:45:45.208,00:45:47.041,"Daisy: HELLO, JORDAN."
00:45:47.083,00:45:49.625,ONE OF THEM WAS IN THE CAR WITH HER.
00:45:49.667,00:45:52.041,IT WAS GATSBY.
00:45:52.083,00:45:56.000,AND THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER IS THE WAY ALL GIRLS WANT TO BE LOOKED AT.
00:45:56.041,00:45:59.041,SO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
00:45:59.083,00:46:00.792,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW."
00:46:00.834,00:46:03.208,CHARGE!
00:46:04.417,00:46:07.959,GATSBY WAS SENT OFF TO WAR.
00:46:08.000,00:46:10.917,"WHEN THE WAR ENDED, DAISY WAITED."
00:46:10.959,00:46:15.166,"BUT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, GATSBY COULDN'T RETURN."
00:46:15.208,00:46:20.750,"A YEAR LATER, TOM BUCHANAN OF CHICAGO SWEPT IN AND STOLE HER AWAY."
00:46:20.792,00:46:26.750,"HE GAVE HER A STRING OF PEARLS WORTH $350,000."
00:46:26.792,00:46:30.500,"BUT THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING, DAISY RECEIVED A LETTER."
00:46:30.542,00:46:31.875,TELL THEM DAISY'S CHANGED HER MIND!
00:46:31.917,00:46:33.083,Daisy's mother: WHAT IS THIS?!
00:46:33.125,00:46:34.250,"Jordan: DAISY, PLEASE!"
00:46:34.291,00:46:35.792,HAND IT TO ME!
00:46:35.834,00:46:37.375,LEAVE ME ALONE!
00:46:37.417,00:46:39.583,"JORDAN, NO ONE MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS."
00:46:39.625,00:46:41.542,"Nick: WELL, WHAT WAS IN THE LETTER?"
00:46:41.583,00:46:43.375,Jordan: I DON'T KNOW.
00:46:43.417,00:46:45.041,BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.
00:46:45.083,00:46:53.792,"THAT DAY AT 5:00, DAISY FAY MARRIED TOM BUCHANAN WITH MORE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE THAN LOUISVILLE HAD EVER SEEN."
00:46:57.917,00:47:01.625,"AFTER THE HONEYMOON, I SAW THEM IN SANTA BARBARA."
00:47:01.667,00:47:03.542,"WELL, IT WAS TOUCHING, REALLY."
00:47:03.583,00:47:06.458,I'D NEVER SEEN A GIRL SO IN LOVE WITH HER HUSBAND.
00:47:06.500,00:47:08.208,"A WEEK LATER, TOM CRASHED HIS CAR."
00:47:08.250,00:47:11.792,THE GIRL WITH HIM WAS A CHAMBERMAID AT THE SANTA BARBARA HOTEL.
00:47:11.834,00:47:15.083,IT GOT INTO ALL THE PAPERS.
00:47:15.125,00:47:17.583,IT'S A STRANGE COINCIDENCE.
00:47:17.625,00:47:20.959,THE FACT THAT GATSBY'S HOUSE IS JUST ACROSS THE BAY.
00:47:21.000,00:47:23.166,IT'S NO COINCIDENCE.
00:47:23.208,00:47:26.417,HE BOUGHT THAT HOUSE TO BE NEAR HER.
00:47:26.458,00:47:30.041,HE THREW ALL THOSE PARTIES HOPING SHE'D WANDER IN ONE NIGHT.
00:47:30.083,00:47:32.166,HE CONSTANTLY ASKED ABOUT DAISY.
00:47:32.208,00:47:34.834,I WAS JUST THE FIRST PERSON THAT KNEW HER.
00:47:34.875,00:47:38.375,ALL THAT FOR A GIRL HE HASN'T SEEN IN FIVE YEARS.
00:47:38.417,00:47:42.250,AND NOW HE JUST WANTS ME TO INVITE HER OVER TO TEA.
00:47:42.291,00:47:43.750,THE MODESTY OF IT.
00:47:43.792,00:47:45.834,"KINDA TAKES YOUR BREATH AWAY, DOESN'T IT?"
00:47:45.875,00:47:48.125,"EVENING, SWEETHEARTS."
00:47:48.166,00:47:49.458,WHERE ARE YOU KIDS GOING?
00:47:49.500,00:47:51.333,"LONG ISLAND, PLEASE."
00:47:51.375,00:47:52.875,Nick: AND YOU THINK I SHOULD.
00:47:52.917,00:47:54.750,"I MEAN, DOES DAISY WANT TO SEE GATSBY?"
00:47:54.792,00:47:56.583,SHE'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TO KNOW.
00:47:56.625,00:48:00.041,YOU'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO INVITE HER OVER SO HE CAN HAPPEN TO PASS BY.
00:48:00.083,00:48:03.500,Nick: I REMEMBER FEELING TORN.
00:48:03.542,00:48:10.375,"WAS IT RIGHT TO BRING MY COUSIN DAISY, A MARRIED WOMAN, TOGETHER WITH A MAN I HARDLY KNEW?"
00:48:15.083,00:48:22.208,"WHEN I RETURNED HOME, GATSBY'S WAS LIT FROM TOWER TO CELLAR AS IF FOR ANOTHER WILD PARTY."
00:48:26.000,00:48:29.000,BUT THERE WASN'T A SOUND.
00:48:42.208,00:48:43.875,Nick: THANK YOU.
00:48:43.917,00:48:45.250,"Driver: HAVE A GOOD NIGHT, SIR."
00:48:53.709,00:48:58.625,"YOUR PLACE LOOKS LIKE THE WORLD'S FAIR, OR -- OR CONEY ISLAND."
00:48:58.667,00:49:00.375,"AH, DOES IT?"
00:49:00.417,00:49:05.041,"WELL, I'VE -- I'VE JUST BEEN GLANCING INTO SOME OF THE ROOMS."
00:49:05.083,00:49:06.375,"WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO TO CONEY ISLAND, OLD SPORT?"
00:49:06.417,00:49:08.041,WE -- WE COULD TAKE MY CAR IF YOU LIKE.
00:49:08.083,00:49:10.291,"OH, UH, IT'S TOO LATE TONIGHT."
00:49:10.333,00:49:11.917,WE COULD TAKE A PLUNGE IN THE SWIMMING POOL.
00:49:11.959,00:49:13.291,I HAVEN'T MADE USE OF IT ALL SUMMER.
00:49:13.333,00:49:14.875,I MUST GO TO BED.
00:49:14.917,00:49:17.083,ALL RIGHT.
00:49:24.291,00:49:26.333,HAPPY TO DO IT.
00:49:26.375,00:49:29.875,I'M GOING TO CALL DAISY AND INVITE HER TO TEA.
00:49:29.917,00:49:33.333,"THAT'S ALL RIGHT, I -- WHAT DAY WOULD SUIT YOU?"
00:49:33.375,00:49:35.417,"YOU SEE, I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU TO ANY TROUBLE."
00:49:35.458,00:49:36.917,DAY AFTER TOMORROW ALL RIGHT?
00:49:36.959,00:49:39.417,DAY AFTER TOMORROW?
00:49:39.458,00:49:44.625,"WELL, I-I'D -- SEE, I-I-I'D WANT TO GET THE GRASS CUT."
00:49:44.667,00:49:47.166,UH...
00:49:47.208,00:49:51.000,"UH...WELL, LOOK HERE, OLD SPORT."
00:49:51.041,00:49:53.750,"YOU -- YOU DON'T MAKE MUCH MONEY, DO YOU?"
00:49:53.792,00:49:55.959,NOT REALLY.
00:49:56.000,00:49:57.333,IF YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.
00:49:57.375,00:50:00.333,"YOU SEE, I HAPPEN TO RUN A LITTLE -- A LITTLE BUSINESS ON THE SIDE."
00:50:00.375,00:50:01.875,A SORT OF SIDELINE.
00:50:01.917,00:50:04.834,"I MEAN, YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING, RIGHT?"
00:50:04.875,00:50:06.166,"YOU DO SELL BONDS, DON'T YOU, OLD SPORT?"
00:50:06.208,00:50:07.500,I'M TRYING TO.
00:50:07.542,00:50:10.834,"RIGHT, WELL, HAPPENS TO BE A RATHER CONFIDENTIAL SORT OF THING..."
00:50:10.875,00:50:12.083,...BUT YOU MIGHT MAKE A NICE BIT OF MONEY ON THE SIDE.
00:50:12.125,00:50:13.875,"NO, THANK YOU."
00:50:13.917,00:50:16.542,"WELL, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO ANY BUSINESS WITH WOLFSHIEM, I ASSURE YOU."
00:50:16.583,00:50:18.750,"IT'S A FAVOR, JAY."
00:50:21.083,00:50:23.834,YES.
00:50:23.875,00:50:25.959,FAVOR?
00:50:30.667,00:50:32.000,"WELL, GOOD NIGHT."
00:50:32.041,00:50:33.750,GOOD NIGHT.
00:50:52.041,00:50:53.959,GOOD MORNING.
00:51:22.083,00:51:25.834,ONE OF THE PAPERS SAYS THEY THOUGHT THE RAIN WOULD STOP ABOUT 4:00.
00:51:25.875,00:51:29.500,I THINK IT WAS THE -- I THINK IT WAS THE JOURNAL.
00:51:29.542,00:51:30.834,AH.
00:51:32.417,00:51:34.375,"JUST IN TO THE RIGHT, GENTLEMEN."
00:51:34.417,00:51:36.000,TO THE RIGHT IN THE LIVING ROOM.
00:51:40.583,00:51:43.208,IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
00:51:43.250,00:51:45.583,"OH, THE GRASS LOOKS FINE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN."
00:51:45.625,00:51:47.792,GRASS? WHAT GRASS?
00:51:52.041,00:51:53.959,I BOUGHT CAKES.
00:52:06.500,00:52:07.875,HAVE YOU -- HAVE YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED?
00:52:07.917,00:52:09.834,PERHAPS SOME MORE FLOWERS.
00:52:11.250,00:52:13.000,"I THINK THEY DID A FINE JOB, DON'T YOU?"
00:52:13.041,00:52:14.750,BEAUTIFUL.
00:52:14.792,00:52:16.291,DO YOU THINK IT'S TOO MUCH?
00:52:16.333,00:52:19.500,OH. I THINK IT'S WHAT YOU WANT.
00:52:19.542,00:52:22.375,I THINK SO TOO.
00:52:43.333,00:52:46.000,I CAN'T WAIT ALL DAY.
00:52:46.041,00:52:47.542,I'M LEAVING.
00:52:47.583,00:52:50.166,DON'T BE SILLY.
00:52:50.208,00:52:51.875,NO ONE'S COMING TO TEA!
00:52:50.208,00:53:01.667,IT'S TOO -- IT'S HER!
00:53:01.709,00:53:03.166,MM.
00:53:14.875,00:53:17.750,"IS THIS ABSOLUTELY WHERE YOU LIVE, MY DEAREST ONE?"
00:53:17.792,00:53:19.500,"Nick: YES, IT SUITS ME."
00:53:19.542,00:53:22.083,WHY DID I HAVE TO COME ALONE?
00:53:22.125,00:53:24.041,ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH ME?
00:53:24.083,00:53:26.333,"OH, IT'S THE SECRET OF CARRAWAY CASTLE."
00:53:26.375,00:53:29.291,TELL YOUR CHAUFFEUR TO GO FAR AWAY.
00:53:29.333,00:53:30.625,"Daisy: COME BACK IN AN HOUR, FERDIE!"
00:53:30.667,00:53:32.125,HIS NAME IS FERDIE.
00:53:39.709,00:53:41.208,OH.
00:53:44.000,00:53:47.250,OH. MY GOODNESS.
00:53:47.291,00:53:50.875,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
00:53:50.917,00:53:55.333,YOU -- DID YOU RANSACK A GREENHOUSE?
00:53:55.375,00:53:58.166,HE IS IN LOVE WITH ME.
00:54:12.291,00:54:13.250,WOULD YOU?
00:54:13.291,00:54:15.208,THAT'S FUNNY.
00:54:15.250,00:54:16.709,WHAT'S FUNNY?
00:54:19.500,00:54:22.500,AH.
00:54:25.375,00:54:27.667,WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
00:55:17.750,00:55:20.875,I'M CERTAINLY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
00:55:20.917,00:55:29.291,"I -- I'M -- I'M CERTAINLY GLAD TO SEE YOU, AS WELL."
00:55:56.500,00:56:00.542,"WE'VE -- WE'VE, UM, MET BEFORE."
00:56:03.875,00:56:08.166,I'LL HAVE SOMEONE COME REPAIR THIS IMMEDIATELY.
00:56:24.041,00:56:26.375,SORRY ABOUT THE CLOCK.
00:56:26.417,00:56:28.959,THAT'S AN OLD CLOCK.
00:56:29.000,00:56:30.250,"LOVELY, THOUGH."
00:56:30.291,00:56:32.375,YES.
00:56:32.417,00:56:34.458,WE HAVEN'T MET FOR MANY YEARS.
00:56:34.500,00:56:36.083,FIVE YEARS NEXT NOVEMBER.

00:56:39.834,00:56:42.166,"YES, THANK YOU."
00:56:42.208,00:56:44.000,LEMON OR SUGAR?
00:56:44.041,00:56:45.959,PLAIN.
00:57:03.917,00:57:05.417,I JUST HAVE TO POP INTO TOWN.
00:57:05.458,00:57:07.583,TOWN?
00:57:07.625,00:57:09.667,"NICK, I'VE GOTTA SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING."
00:57:09.709,00:57:12.417,YES. I'LL -- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
00:57:12.458,00:57:13.750,God!
00:57:13.792,00:57:15.208,"This was a terrible, terrible mistake."
00:57:15.250,00:57:17.125,YOU'RE JUST EMBARRASSED.
00:57:17.166,00:57:20.458,SHE'S EMBARRASSED?
00:57:20.500,00:57:22.583,YES.
00:57:22.625,00:57:24.041,Don't talk so loud.
00:57:24.083,00:57:25.500,HEY. YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A LITTLE BOY.
00:57:25.542,00:57:27.083,YOU'RE BEING RUDE.
00:57:27.125,00:57:29.041,DAISY'S IN THERE ALL ALONE AND YOU'RE -- Shh.
00:58:03.375,00:58:14.834,LOOKING OVER MY STORY SO FAR I'M REMINDED THAT FOR THE SECOND TIME THAT SUMMER I WAS GUARDING OTHER PEOPLE'S SECRETS.
00:58:14.875,00:58:21.417,"ONCE AGAIN, I WAS WITHIN AND WITHOUT."
00:58:48.917,00:58:51.125,IT'S STOPPED RAINING.
00:58:54.375,00:58:56.208,YES.
00:58:56.250,00:58:57.959,"IT HAS, HASN'T IT?"
00:59:09.875,00:59:12.834,"WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, DAISY?"
00:59:12.875,00:59:15.583,COME LOOK.
00:59:15.625,00:59:18.208,"OH, NICKY. HOW FUNNY."
00:59:18.250,00:59:21.959,"LOOK, IT'S MY HOUSE."
00:59:24.500,00:59:27.291,JUST THERE ACROSS THE BAY.
00:59:33.041,00:59:34.625,I KNOW.
00:59:34.667,00:59:38.834,I HAVE THE SAME VIEW FROM MY PLACE.
00:59:38.875,00:59:41.500,WHERE'S YOUR PLACE?
00:59:44.333,00:59:48.792,"NICK, I WANT YOU AND DAISY BOTH TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE."
00:59:48.834,00:59:50.417,I'D LIKE TO SHOW HER AROUND.
00:59:50.458,00:59:52.083,YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO COME?
00:59:52.125,00:59:54.500,"ABSOLUTELY, OLD SPORT."
00:59:54.542,00:59:57.417,ABSOLUTELY.
00:59:57.458,00:59:58.959,"LADNER, OPEN THE GATES."
00:59:59.000,01:00:00.667,OPEN THE GATES!
01:00:00.709,01:00:05.333,I HAD THE GATES BROUGHT IN FROM A CASTLE IN NORMANDY.
01:00:05.375,01:00:08.875,"Daisy: OH, JAY!"
01:00:08.917,01:00:10.250,YOU LIKE IT?
01:00:10.291,01:00:11.667,I LOVE IT.
01:00:11.709,01:00:14.625,BUT HOW DO YOU LIVE HERE ALL ALONE?
01:00:14.667,01:00:16.041,"WELL, I DON'T."
01:00:16.083,01:00:21.083,"I KEEP IT ALWAYS FULL OF INTERESTING, CELEBRATED PEOPLE."
01:00:21.125,01:00:23.709,COME WITH ME.
01:00:27.208,01:00:30.125,"THE HOUSE LOOKS WELL, DOESN'T IT?"
01:00:30.166,01:00:32.458,SEE THE WAY THE WHOLE FRONT CATCHES THE LIGHT LIKE THAT?
01:00:32.500,01:00:33.834,"OH, IT'S SPLENDID."
01:00:37.041,01:00:39.667,"Daisy: COME ON, YOU TWO!"
01:00:39.709,01:00:42.792,YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT I LIKE ALL THINGS THAT ARE MODERN.
01:00:42.834,01:00:44.291,"PRESSES THE ORANGE, IT ALL COMES OUT THERE."
01:00:48.959,01:00:54.125,YEAH!
01:00:54.166,01:00:55.625,Gatsby: ANYONE FOR A ROUND OF GOLF?
01:00:55.667,01:00:57.208,"Daisy: YOU DO KNOW I'M A CHAMPION GOLFER, DON'T YOU?"
01:00:57.250,01:00:59.208,GREAT!
01:00:59.250,01:01:01.583,"WELL, GO ON."
01:01:01.625,01:01:03.667,"REMARKABLE LITTLE CAMERA, ISN'T IT? LATEST DESIGN."
01:01:03.709,01:01:05.291,LET ME SHOW YOU.
01:01:05.333,01:01:06.792,"NICK, KEEP FILMING."
01:01:06.834,01:01:07.834,SHE'S GONNA TAKE A SWING.
01:01:07.875,01:01:09.792,HEY! FORE!
01:01:11.542,01:01:13.333,I'M SUCH A BRUTE.
01:01:13.375,01:01:15.041,"OKAY, YOU READY FOR YOUR CLOSE-UP?"
01:01:15.083,01:01:16.834,Gatsby: I DON'T WANT TO FORGET A SINGLE MOMENT.
01:01:16.875,01:01:18.542,YOU'RE SHIMMERING.
01:01:18.583,01:01:21.917,"SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD BE ON THE COVER OF VOGUE, DON'T YOU THINK?"
01:01:23.417,01:01:24.667,Nick: WHERE'D YOU GO?
01:01:24.709,01:01:26.166,SLOW DOWN.
01:01:30.291,01:01:32.083,OH.
01:01:32.125,01:01:33.417,IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
01:01:33.458,01:01:35.792,IT'S A CUSTOM WURLITZER.
01:01:35.834,01:01:37.083,CAN ANYONE PLAY THAT?
01:01:37.125,01:01:38.709,KLIPSPRINGER CAN.
01:01:38.750,01:01:41.000,"OF COURSE, SIR."
01:01:41.041,01:01:42.250,AND THEN WE CAN DANCE ALL NIGHT!
01:01:42.291,01:01:43.500,Gatsby: EWING'S A SYMPHONIC GENIUS.
01:01:43.542,01:01:44.750,HE CAN PLAY ANYTHING.
01:01:44.792,01:01:46.125,THEN I DEMAND THE CHARLESTON.
01:01:46.166,01:01:49.166,"SHE MAKES IT LOOK SO -- SO SPLENDID, DON'T YOU THINK, OLD SPORT?"
01:01:51.500,01:01:54.542,I HAVE A MAN IN ENGLAND WHO BUYS ME CLOTHES.
01:01:54.583,01:01:56.291,Daisy: I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.
01:01:56.333,01:01:58.333,THIS'LL DO FOR THE LADY.
01:01:58.375,01:02:01.291,HE SENDS OVER A SELECTION AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH SEASON.
01:02:01.333,01:02:02.917,Daisy: JAY!
01:02:02.959,01:02:04.625,THESE ARE SILK.
01:02:04.667,01:02:05.917,THESE ARE FLANNEL.
01:02:05.959,01:02:07.667,THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL!
01:02:07.709,01:02:10.458,INDIAN COTTON.
01:02:10.500,01:02:11.875,LINEN.
01:02:13.083,01:02:14.750,"NICKY, HE'S A MADMAN!"
01:02:14.792,01:02:17.208,Nick: I CAN'T HELP YOU!
01:02:17.250,01:02:19.375,YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE-FOLD EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
01:02:19.417,01:02:21.375,YOU'LL RUIN THEM!
01:02:24.208,01:02:26.000,JAY!
01:02:26.041,01:02:28.667,RIGHT HERE!
01:02:44.583,01:02:46.583,WHAT IS IT?
01:02:48.959,01:02:52.041,"Daisy, Daisy, darling, what is it?"
01:02:52.083,01:02:58.792,IT -- IT MAKES ME SAD.
01:02:58.834,01:03:01.834,WHY?
01:03:01.875,01:03:04.792,BECAUSE...
01:03:06.583,01:03:13.333,FIVE LOST YEARS STRUGGLED ON DAISY'S LIPS.
01:03:13.375,01:03:20.333,BUT ALL SHE COULD MANAGE WAS: WHY?
01:03:22.500,01:03:25.041,BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS BEFORE.
01:03:45.667,01:03:52.166,IT WASN'T FOR THE MIST WE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT.
01:03:56.792,01:03:59.917,WHAT GREEN LIGHT?
01:03:59.959,01:04:04.667,THE ONE THAT BURNS ALL NIGHT AT THE END OF YOUR DOCK.
01:04:06.625,01:04:15.375,POSSIBLY IT HAD OCCURRED TO GATSBY THAT THE COLOSSAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT LIGHT HAD VANISHED FOREVER.
01:04:15.417,01:04:19.875,NOW IT WAS ONCE AGAIN JUST A GREEN LIGHT ON A DOCK.
01:04:19.917,01:04:24.834,AND HIS COUNT OF ENCHANTED OBJECTS HAD DIMINISHED BY ONE.
01:04:24.875,01:04:26.458,WHO'S THIS?
01:04:26.500,01:04:28.041,YOUR FATHER?
01:04:28.083,01:04:30.041,"Gatsby: OH, NO."
01:04:30.083,01:04:32.834,HE'S DEAD NOW.
01:04:32.875,01:04:35.417,HE USED TO BE MY BEST FRIEND MANY YEARS AGO.
01:04:35.458,01:04:38.041,YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU HAD A POMPADOUR.
01:04:38.083,01:04:39.291,OR A YACHT.
01:04:39.333,01:04:42.917,I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHIN'.
01:04:42.959,01:04:44.959,HAVE A SEAT.
01:04:45.000,01:04:47.750,THESE ARE A LOT OF CLIPPINGS I COLLECTED.
01:04:47.792,01:04:50.917,ABOUT YOU.
01:04:53.375,01:04:54.875,YOU SAVED MY LETTERS.
01:04:54.917,01:04:59.208,THIS WAS MY FIRST PHOTO OF YOU.
01:05:00.917,01:05:02.208,YOU REMEMBER THIS LETTER HERE?
01:05:02.250,01:05:07.709,Daisy: WE CAN'T LOSE EACH OTHER AND LET ALL THIS GLORIOUS LOVE END IN NOTHING.
01:05:07.750,01:05:09.125,COME HOME.
01:05:09.166,01:05:14.166,I'LL BE HERE WAITING AND HOPING FOR EVERY LONG DREAM OF YOU TO COME TRUE.
01:05:15.875,01:05:19.208,EXCUSE ME.
01:05:25.959,01:05:28.417,"MAN: Sir, Slagle's in Detroit."
01:05:28.458,01:05:30.458,"I CAN'T TALK NOW, OLD SPORT."
01:05:32.500,01:05:35.917,Gatsby: HE MUST KNOW WHAT A SMALL TOWN IS.
01:05:35.959,01:05:38.208,"NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME."
01:05:41.166,01:05:43.083,I SAID A SMALL TOWN.
01:05:44.458,01:05:46.917,HE MUST KNOW WHAT A SMALL TOWN IS.
01:05:51.000,01:05:57.291,"LISTEN TO ME, HE'S OF NO USE TO US IF DETROIT IS HIS IDEA OF A SMALL TOWN, YOU UNDERSTAND?"
01:06:00.667,01:06:03.917,"WE'LL CHAT LATER, OLD SPORT."
01:06:03.959,01:06:07.000,ALL RIGHT.
01:06:08.458,01:06:10.834,KLIPSPRINGER.
01:06:12.917,01:06:14.166,HE MUST BE AWAKE.
01:06:16.834,01:06:18.834,SHALL WE?
01:06:26.083,01:06:27.542,WHOO!
01:06:27.583,01:06:29.166,OH!
01:06:30.709,01:06:32.125,WHEW!
01:06:33.166,01:06:35.125,HEY.
01:07:09.792,01:07:13.458,I WISH I'D DONE EVERYTHING ON EARTH WITH YOU.
01:07:19.750,01:07:21.667,ALL MY LIFE.
01:07:24.208,01:07:27.709,I WISH IT COULD ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS.
01:07:34.542,01:07:36.083,IT WILL BE.
01:07:39.959,01:07:45.667,Nick: IF ONLY IT'D BEEN ENOUGH FOR GATSBY JUST TO HOLD DAISY.
01:07:45.709,01:07:51.542,BUT HE HAD A GRAND VISION FOR HIS LIFE AND DAISY'S PART IN IT.
01:07:51.583,01:08:03.500,IT WASN'T UNTIL THE END OF THAT SUMMER ON THE LAST NIGHT I SAW GATSBY THAT HE TOLD ME OF THE LIFE HE HAD DREAMED FOR HIMSELF SINCE HE WAS A BOY.
01:08:03.542,01:08:09.917,"YOU SEE, DOCTOR, GATSBY'S REAL NAME WAS..."
01:08:09.959,01:08:12.625,JAMES GATZ.
01:08:12.667,01:08:17.750,HIS PARENTS WERE DIRT POOR FARMERS FROM NORTH DAKOTA.
01:08:17.792,01:08:20.875,BUT HE NEVER ACCEPTED THEM AS HIS PARENTS AT ALL.
01:08:22.375,01:08:26.583,"IN HIS OWN IMAGINATION, HE WAS A SON OF GOD..."
01:08:26.625,01:08:31.458,DESTINED FOR FUTURE GLORY.
01:08:31.500,01:08:35.750,"CHASING THIS DESTINY, A 16-YEAR-OLD GATZ RAN FAR, FAR AWAY."
01:08:35.792,01:08:41.667,"ONE AFTERNOON, OFF THE COAST OF LAKE SUPERIOR, HE SPOTTED A YACHT IN PERIL."
01:08:41.709,01:08:48.291,"HE ROWED OUT AND RESCUED THE VESSEL AND ITS CAPTAIN, ALCOHOLIC MILLIONAIRE DAN CODY."
01:08:48.333,01:08:50.750,AH! WHERE'S THE BOAT?
01:08:50.792,01:08:52.083,YOU'RE GONNA HIT THE SHOAL!
01:08:52.125,01:08:53.625,"COME ON, SIR, WE'RE GONNA HIT THE SHOAL!"
01:08:53.667,01:08:56.041,WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOIN'...
01:08:56.083,01:08:58.917,OLD SPORT?
01:08:58.959,01:09:02.500,"THIS WAS HIS OPPORTUNITY, AND HE SEIZED IT."
01:09:02.542,01:09:05.792,AND I DECIDED RIGHT THEN AND THERE TO CALL MYSELF JAY GATSBY.
01:09:05.834,01:09:09.333,HE SAILED THE YACHT OUT OF DANGER AND INTO HIS FUTURE.
01:09:09.375,01:09:13.041,GATSBY SHOWED SKILL AND AMBITION.
01:09:13.083,01:09:15.625,"AND FOR FIVE YEARS, THEY SAILED THE WORLD."
01:09:15.667,01:09:19.458,"HE WAS ALL RIGHT, OLD DAN."
01:09:19.500,01:09:21.792,"HOW TO DRESS, ACT AND SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN."
01:09:21.834,01:09:23.750,GATSBY. JAY GATSBY.
01:09:23.792,01:09:25.667,"SHE LOOKS WELL, DOESN'T SHE..."
01:09:25.709,01:09:27.750,GATSBY HOPED TO INHERIT CODY'S FORTUNE.
01:09:27.792,01:09:29.959,...OLD SPORT?
01:09:27.792,01:09:34.750,"BUT WHEN CODY DIED, GATSBY WAS CHEATED OF HIS INHERITANCE BY CODY'S FAMILY."
01:09:34.792,01:09:41.000,"HE'D BEEN LEFT WITH THE ABILITY TO PLAY THE GENTLEMAN, BUT HE WAS ONCE AGAIN DIRT POOR."
01:09:42.709,01:09:48.458,"BY MIDSUMMER, GATSBY WAS FRONT PAGE NEWS."
01:09:59.208,01:10:02.417,WHERE DID THE MONEY COME FROM?
01:10:15.208,01:10:18.750,THAT'S WHAT ALL OF NEW YORK WANTED TO KNOW.
01:10:18.792,01:10:24.041,AND IT WAS THE SAME QUESTION ON TOM'S MIND WHEN HE ACCOMPANIED DAISY TO ONE OF GATSBY'S...
01:10:24.083,01:10:25.500,WE'VE GOT A GREAT BAND.
01:10:25.542,01:10:26.834,...GLITTERING PARTIES.
01:10:26.875,01:10:28.333,TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
01:10:28.375,01:10:30.583,I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
01:10:30.625,01:10:34.542,"YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THESE NEWLY RICH PEOPLE ARE JUST FILTHY BOOTLEGGERS."
01:10:34.583,01:10:36.166,NOT GATSBY.
01:10:36.208,01:10:38.125,HE'S A BUSINESSMAN.
01:10:38.166,01:10:39.458,BUSINESSMAN!
01:10:39.500,01:10:42.083,MAY I INTRODUCE SENATOR GULICK.
01:10:42.125,01:10:43.500,THIS IS MR. CARRAWAY.
01:10:43.542,01:10:45.625,MRS. BUCHANAN.
01:10:45.667,01:10:47.000,CHARMED.
01:10:47.041,01:10:48.709,DELIGHTED.
01:10:48.750,01:10:52.000,"OH, AND MR. BUCHANAN, THE -- THE POLO PLAYER."
01:10:53.041,01:10:55.542,"NO, NOT ME."
01:10:55.583,01:10:56.834,ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO MEET A BUCHANAN.
01:10:56.875,01:10:58.208,Tom: LIKEWISE.
01:10:58.250,01:10:59.834,"SENATOR, I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER."
01:10:59.875,01:11:01.125,PERHAPS AT THE CRAPS TABLE.
01:11:01.166,01:11:02.375,I'D RATHER NOT BE THE POLO PLAYER.
01:11:02.417,01:11:03.792,TOM.
01:11:03.834,01:11:06.792,YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS.
01:11:06.834,01:11:08.959,MAY I SHOW YOU AROUND?
01:11:09.000,01:11:10.625,SURE.
01:11:13.041,01:11:16.375,Gatsby: YOU MUST KNOW THE FACES OF MANY PEOPLE YOU'VE HEARD OF!
01:11:16.417,01:11:19.375,WE DON'T GO AROUND VERY MUCH.
01:11:19.417,01:11:21.500,I DON'T THINK I RECOGNIZE A SINGLE PERSON.
01:11:21.542,01:11:23.875,PERHAPS YOU KNOW THAT LADY RIGHT THERE.
01:11:23.917,01:11:26.709,Daisy: IT'S MARLENE WOOD.
01:11:26.750,01:11:30.291,WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO INTRODUCE YOU?
01:11:30.333,01:11:33.458,I'D REALLY RATHER NOT BE THE POLO PLAYER.
01:11:40.041,01:11:42.041,THESE THINGS EXCITE ME SO.
01:11:42.083,01:11:43.750,Nick: NICE LITTLE DANCE.
01:11:47.458,01:11:50.291,"I BELIEVE WE'VE MET BEFORE, MR. BUCHANAN."
01:11:50.333,01:11:51.667,ABOUT A MONTH AGO.
01:11:53.875,01:11:55.959,THAT'S RIGHT.
01:11:56.000,01:11:58.333,AND YOU WERE WITH NICK HERE.
01:11:58.375,01:12:00.917,AT THE BARBERSHOP.
01:12:00.959,01:12:02.583,THAT'S RIGHT.
01:12:02.625,01:12:04.959,"SEE, I KNOW YOUR WIFE."
01:12:05.000,01:12:08.291,THAT SO?
01:12:08.333,01:12:09.417,YES.
01:12:13.291,01:12:15.667,"Herzog: MR. GATSBY, SIR."
01:12:15.709,01:12:18.083,MR. SLAGLE IS HERE.
01:12:18.125,01:12:19.959,Not now.
01:12:20.000,01:12:23.625,"Trimalchio: DICE, BRASSKNUCKLES AND GUITARS WITH: THE FOXTROT."
01:12:37.625,01:12:40.583,MR. BUCHANAN.
01:12:40.625,01:12:42.417,WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY?
01:12:42.458,01:12:46.375,OF COURSE NOT.
01:12:49.208,01:12:53.500,I THINK I CAN KEEP MYSELF AMUSED.
01:12:53.542,01:12:57.041,IN CASE YOU NEED TO TAKE DOWN ANY ADDRESSES.
01:13:10.208,01:13:12.875,PLEASE MOVE ASIDE.
01:13:12.917,01:13:14.458,SHALL WE?
01:13:16.208,01:13:17.834,"ANOTHER SWELL PARTY, JAY."
01:13:17.875,01:13:20.625,"BE CAREFUL FOR THE SNAKE CHARMER, MR. McLENNEHAN."
01:13:20.667,01:13:25.083,IS ALL THIS MADE ENTIRELY FROM YOUR OWN IMAGINATION?
01:13:25.125,01:13:27.667,NO.
01:13:27.709,01:13:33.500,"YOU SEE, YOU WERE THERE ALL ALONG IN EVERY IDEA..."
01:13:33.542,01:13:36.208,IN EVERY DECISION.
01:13:36.250,01:13:40.250,"OF COURSE, IF ANYTHING IS NOT TO YOUR LIKING, I'LL CHANGE IT."
01:13:42.417,01:13:45.041,IT'S PERFECT.
01:13:45.083,01:13:50.542,"FROM YOUR PERFECT, IRRESISTIBLE IMAGINATION."
01:13:53.083,01:13:57.750,I WONDER WHERE THE DEVIL HE MET DAISY.
01:14:05.125,01:14:06.875,I'LL FIND YOU.
01:14:06.917,01:14:08.208,ALL RIGHT.
01:14:12.834,01:14:14.083,COME WITH ME.
01:14:16.667,01:14:18.125,"COMING THROUGH, PLEASE."
01:14:18.166,01:14:19.834,PARDON ME.
01:14:21.500,01:14:23.291,THANK YOU.
01:15:46.083,01:15:48.458,Tom: HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE?
01:15:50.083,01:15:52.291,NO.
01:15:52.333,01:15:54.250,NOT FOR A WHILE.
01:15:57.417,01:15:59.208,WHISKEY.
01:15:59.250,01:16:01.917,"IT'S FUNNY, THE SENATOR JUST SAW HER DOWN HERE."
01:16:06.000,01:16:08.917,I WISH WE COULD JUST RUN AWAY.
01:16:18.333,01:16:19.417,RUN AWAY?
01:16:19.458,01:16:21.208,NO.
01:16:21.250,01:16:26.500,"DAISY, DARLING, THAT -- THAT WOULDN'T BE RESPECTABLE."
01:16:26.542,01:16:29.000,"YOU LIVE AROUND HERE, NICK?"
01:16:29.041,01:16:31.625,JUST NEXT DOOR.
01:16:31.667,01:16:33.959,THAT SO?
01:16:36.667,01:16:41.000,WE'RE GONNA LIVE HERE IN THIS HOUSE.
01:16:41.041,01:16:44.750,YOU AND ME.
01:16:46.625,01:16:48.875,DARLING...
01:16:50.583,01:16:52.750,...IT'S TIME TO TELL TOM.
01:16:55.375,01:16:58.750,"Waiter: COME ON, BOYS."
01:16:58.792,01:17:00.083,"GOOD NIGHT, GENTLEMEN."
01:17:00.125,01:17:02.959,WHAT A CIRCUS.
01:17:06.583,01:17:12.625,"WELL, IF YOU SEE HER, I'LL BE LOOKING FOR HER."
01:17:12.667,01:17:14.375,YOU TELL HER.
01:17:14.417,01:17:16.583,REMEMBER HOW MUCH FUN WE HAD?
01:17:16.625,01:17:19.250,I DON'T KNOW WHY WE CAN'T JUST HAVE FUN LIKE THAT AGAIN.
01:17:19.291,01:17:20.333,Nick: HELLO?
01:17:23.500,01:17:24.959,"HELLO, NICKY."
01:17:25.000,01:17:26.542,WE'RE HAVING A ROW.
01:17:26.583,01:17:28.417,WHAT ABOUT?
01:17:28.458,01:17:30.875,ABOUT...THINGS.
01:17:30.917,01:17:32.667,ABOUT THE FUTURE.
01:17:32.709,01:17:37.291,THE FUTURE OF THE COLORED EMPIRES.
01:17:37.333,01:17:39.375,IT'S TOM.
01:17:39.417,01:17:42.000,HE'S WANDERING AROUND THE PARTY LOOKING -- Herzog: SIR.
01:17:42.041,01:17:44.125,"MR. GATSBY, SIR."
01:17:44.166,01:17:48.709,IT'S MR. SLAGLE.
01:17:48.750,01:17:50.917,EXCUSE ME.
01:17:53.333,01:17:56.375,NICK.
01:17:56.417,01:17:58.166,OF COURSE.
01:18:01.375,01:18:07.291,GATSBY DISAPPEARED TO DEAL WITH A DISPUTE OF SOME SORT.
01:18:07.333,01:18:10.291,DAISY WAITED...
01:18:12.792,01:18:16.542,...BUT GATSBY WAS UNABLE TO RETURN.
01:18:18.750,01:18:22.291,"Meyer: WITH THESE HOT-HEADED TYPES IN HERE, I RELY ON YOU."
01:18:22.333,01:18:24.000,BUT YOU WERE NOT AVAILABLE.
01:18:24.041,01:18:27.250,A SCENE WAS MADE.
01:18:30.125,01:18:31.458,Tom: WHERE WERE YOU?
01:18:31.500,01:18:32.750,Daisy: WITH NICKY.
01:18:32.792,01:18:35.375,MR. GATSBY WAS SHOWING US THE GROUNDS.
01:18:35.417,01:18:39.834,HE CERTAINLY MUST HAVE STRAINED HIMSELF TO GET THIS MENAGERIE TOGETHER.
01:18:42.291,01:18:46.166,I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE DOES.
01:18:46.208,01:18:49.917,AND I THINK I'LL MAKE A POINT OF FINDING OUT.
01:19:06.750,01:19:08.583,Servant: I'M NOT SURE.
01:19:08.625,01:19:10.417,Servant #2: TO THE LEFT.
01:19:10.458,01:19:15.834,"Servant #3: YEAH, WE'LL PILE THAT STUFF IN THE GARAGE, IT'S GOING BACK TO TOWN."
01:19:28.083,01:19:31.208,"Nick: OH, THERE YOU ARE."
01:19:31.250,01:19:34.083,"SHE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU, SHE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME."
01:19:34.125,01:19:35.875,SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT.
01:19:35.917,01:19:37.125,OF COURSE SHE DID.
01:19:37.166,01:19:39.291,"NO, NO, NO."
01:19:39.333,01:19:40.667,"NO, SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT."
01:19:40.709,01:19:43.333,SHE -- SHE DID NOT HAVE A GOOD TIME.
01:19:43.375,01:19:46.000,I FEEL SO FAR AWAY FROM HER NOW.
01:19:46.041,01:19:48.041,SO HARD TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND.
01:19:48.083,01:19:49.458,YOU MEAN ABOUT THE PARTY?
01:19:49.500,01:19:51.792,THE PARTY?
01:19:51.834,01:19:55.000,I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE PARTIES.
01:19:55.041,01:19:57.166,"THAT'LL BE ALL FOR NOW, GENTLEMEN."
01:19:57.208,01:19:58.834,THANK YOU.
01:19:58.875,01:20:00.250,Gatsby: YOU SEE...
01:20:02.458,01:20:05.750,...SHE HAS TO TELL TOM THAT SHE NEVER LOVED HIM.
01:20:05.792,01:20:06.750,WHAT?
01:20:06.792,01:20:08.083,YES.
01:20:08.125,01:20:12.500,THEN WE CAN GO BACK TO LOUISVILLE TO HER PARENTS' HOUSE.
01:20:12.542,01:20:14.417,"HER PARENTS ARE LOVELY PEOPLE, OLD SPORT."
01:20:14.458,01:20:16.208,WE'LL BE MARRIED THERE.
01:20:16.250,01:20:22.667,"SEE -- SEE, DAISY AND I ARE GONNA START OVER JUST AS IF IT WERE FIVE YEARS AGO."
01:20:22.709,01:20:24.583,I WOULDN'T ASK TOO MUCH OF HER.
01:20:24.625,01:20:25.917,WOULDN'T ASK TOO MUCH?
01:20:25.959,01:20:28.083,NO.
01:20:30.792,01:20:33.667,"I BEG YOUR PARDON, OLD SPORT."
01:20:30.792,01:20:38.625,"IT'S JUST -- IT'S SO SAD, BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND."
01:20:38.667,01:20:40.667,IT'S SO HARD TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND.
01:20:40.709,01:20:42.750,I'VE GOTTEN ALL THESE THINGS FOR HER.
01:20:42.792,01:20:47.333,"I'VE GOTTEN ALL THESE THINGS FOR HER, AND NOW SHE JUST -- SHE JUST WANTS TO RUN AWAY."
01:20:49.458,01:20:51.125,SHE EVEN WANTS TO LEAVE THAT.
01:20:51.166,01:20:54.583,"JAY, YOU CAN'T REPEAT THE PAST."
01:20:54.625,01:20:57.875,CAN'T REPEAT THE PAST?
01:20:57.917,01:20:59.333,NO.
01:20:59.375,01:21:02.250,"WHY, OF COURSE YOU CAN."
01:21:02.291,01:21:04.875,OF COURSE YOU CAN.
01:21:04.917,01:21:09.417,"SEE, I'M GONNA FIX THINGS JUST THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE."
01:21:09.458,01:21:12.959,EVERYTHING'S BEEN SO -- SO CONFUSED SINCE THEN.
01:21:13.000,01:21:14.834,I...
01:21:14.875,01:21:20.917,HE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE PAST AS IF HE WANTED TO RECOVER SOMETHING.
01:21:20.959,01:21:27.000,IF I -- IF I COULD JUST GET BACK TO THE START.
01:21:27.041,01:21:31.709,IF I COULD JUST GET BACK TO THE START I COULD FIND IT AGAIN.
01:21:31.750,01:21:38.166,SOME VISION OF HIMSELF THAT HE HAD PUT INTO LOVING DAISY.
01:21:38.208,01:21:42.250,"ONE NIGHT IN LOUISVILLE, FIVE YEARS AGO..."
01:21:42.291,01:21:48.583,GATSBY FOUND HIMSELF AT DAISY'S HOUSE BY COLOSSAL ACCIDENT.
01:21:48.625,01:21:52.333,I WENT TO HER HOUSE FIRST WITH SOME OF THE OFFICERS FROM CAMP TAYLOR.
01:21:52.375,01:21:54.917,I'D NEVER BEEN IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE BEFORE.
01:21:54.959,01:21:56.500,"MAY I SAVE THE NEXT DANCE, MISS DAISY?"
01:21:56.542,01:22:01.542,HIS UNIFORM HID THE TRUTH THAT HE WAS A PENNILESS YOUNG MAN...
01:22:01.583,01:22:05.500,...WITH ONLY THAT GRAND VISION OF HIMSELF.
01:22:05.542,01:22:06.709,"DAISY, DON'T SCAMPER."
01:22:06.750,01:22:07.959,"I WAS NOT, MOTHER."
01:22:08.000,01:22:09.875,SO MANY DASHING YOUNG OFFICERS HERE.
01:22:09.917,01:22:12.417,AND FROM SUCH ILLUSTRIOUS FAMILIES.
01:22:12.458,01:22:15.000,Gatsby: I ALWAYS KNEW THAT I COULD CLIMB.
01:22:15.041,01:22:18.625,BUT I COULD ONLY CLIMB IF I CLIMBED ALONE.
01:22:23.166,01:22:27.458,I KNEW THAT WHEN I KISSED THIS GIRL...
01:22:27.500,01:22:31.125,I WOULD BE FOREVER WED TO HER.
01:22:35.542,01:22:37.750,SO I STOPPED.
01:22:39.917,01:22:41.917,I STOPPED AND I...
01:22:41.959,01:22:44.083,I WAITED.
01:22:44.125,01:22:49.542,I WAITED FOR A MOMENT LONGER.
01:22:49.583,01:22:54.542,HE KNEW HIS MIND WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE FREE TO ROMP LIKE...
01:22:54.583,01:22:57.458,THE MIND OF GOD.
01:22:59.375,01:23:07.583,THAT FALLING IN LOVE WOULD CHANGE HIS DESTINY FOREVER.
01:23:09.875,01:23:14.542,AND THEN I JUST LET MYSELF GO.
01:23:21.667,01:23:25.834,SHE BLOSSOMED FOR HIM LIKE A FLOWER...
01:23:25.875,01:23:30.667,AND THE INCARNATION WAS COMPLETE.
01:23:39.709,01:23:44.709,Gatsby: I KNEW IT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE FOR A MAN LIKE ME TO FALL IN LOVE.
01:23:44.750,01:23:47.083,I'M ONLY 32.
01:23:44.750,01:23:56.083,"I MIGHT STILL BE A GREAT MAN IF I COULD FORGET THAT I ONCE LOST DAISY, BUT MY LIFE, OLD SPORT, MY LIFE -- MY LIFE HAS GOT TO BE LIKE THIS."
01:23:59.834,01:24:03.375,IT'S GOT TO KEEP GOING UP.
01:24:08.125,01:24:14.583,SHE HAS TO GO TO TOM AND TELL HIM THAT SHE NEVER LOVED HIM.
01:24:19.542,01:24:21.917,"I JUST NEED TO GIVE HER MORE TIME, OLD SPORT."
01:24:21.959,01:24:24.333,MORE TIME.
01:24:29.542,01:24:32.709,"DON'T WORRY, OLD SPORT."
01:24:32.750,01:24:35.000,I CAN PROTECT HER HERE.
01:24:36.750,01:24:39.250,"GOOD NIGHT, OLD SPORT."
01:24:46.792,01:24:50.542,"YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THE PAST, OLD SPORT."
01:24:50.583,01:24:54.000,YOU'RE WRONG.
01:25:17.750,01:25:20.875,THERE HAD BEEN MUSIC FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S ALL SUMMER.
01:25:20.917,01:25:27.917,"IN HIS BLUE GARDENS, MEN AND GIRLS CAME AND WENT LIKE MOTHS AMONG THE WHISPERINGS AND THE LAUGHTER AND THE STARS."
01:25:27.959,01:25:29.834,BREAKFAST.
01:25:29.875,01:25:31.125,YES.
01:25:31.166,01:25:33.041,"THANK YOU, THANK YOU."
01:25:33.083,01:25:35.291,LAUGHTER.
01:25:35.333,01:25:37.291,THANK YOU.
01:25:37.333,01:25:41.792,"NO, THE WHISPERINGS AND THE CHAMPAGNE AND THE STARS."
01:25:41.834,01:25:43.208,BUT...
01:25:44.834,01:25:52.166,"...AFTER TOM AND DAISY'S VISIT, GATSBY'S LIGHTS WENT OUT ONE BY ONE."
01:25:52.208,01:25:54.333,THERE WERE NO MORE PARTIES.
01:25:58.542,01:26:00.208,DAISY VISITED DISCREETLY.
01:26:02.709,01:26:09.917,FOR THE VERY SAME FAME THAT HAD ALL SUMMER BEEN A SOURCE OF SATISFACTION TO JAY GATSBY...
01:26:09.959,01:26:13.166,HAD BECOME A THREAT.
01:26:41.583,01:26:45.166,I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.
01:26:46.834,01:26:50.083,NICK: I hear you fired all your servants.
01:26:50.125,01:26:53.375,DAISY COMES OVER SOMETIMES IN THE AFTERNOON.
01:26:53.417,01:26:59.083,I WANTED PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T GOSSIP UNTIL WE DECIDE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.
01:26:59.125,01:27:06.250,"YOU SEE, THESE TOWNS ARE -- are very close together, old sport, AND, WELL, IT GETS IN THE PAPERS, YOU UNDERSTAND."
01:27:06.291,01:27:09.208,THEY'RE ALL PEOPLE WOLFSHIEM WANTED TO DO SOMETHING FOR.
01:27:09.250,01:27:13.208,"What's the difference as long as they can cook AND MAKE BEDS, RIGHT?"
01:27:17.000,01:27:19.625,"Nick, Daisy's ready."
01:27:19.667,01:27:21.125,She's ready.
01:27:21.166,01:27:22.875,THERE'S JUST ONE THING.
01:27:22.917,01:27:29.000,SHE'S REQUESTED THAT YOU AND MISS BAKER BE THERE FOR LUNCH TOMORROW AT HER HOUSE.
01:27:29.041,01:27:31.834,"WILL YOU COME, OLD SPORT?"
01:27:31.875,01:27:35.417,Daisy needs you.
01:27:35.458,01:27:39.959,WE NEED YOU.
01:27:45.875,01:27:48.583,"CAN YOU COME, OLD SPORT?"
01:28:05.625,01:28:10.667,"Tom: YOU KNOW, I READ SOMEWHERE THAT THE SUN IS GETTING HOTTER EVERY YEAR."
01:28:10.709,01:28:14.750,WAIT A MINUTE.
01:28:14.792,01:28:17.667,SUN IS GETTING COLDER EVERY YEAR.
01:28:21.792,01:28:23.959,"OH, I WOULD LIKE TO BE OUT ON THAT BAY TODAY."
01:28:25.959,01:28:28.625,I'M RIGHT ACROSS FROM YOU.
01:28:31.125,01:28:34.375,RIGHT THERE.
01:28:36.583,01:28:38.291,OH.
01:28:38.333,01:28:40.291,SO YOU ARE.
01:28:45.750,01:28:54.083,"Gatsby: YOU SEE, EVERY NIGHT I CAN SEE THAT LIGHT AT THE END OF YOUR DOCK BLINKING."
01:28:54.125,01:28:56.750,WHAT LIGHT?
01:29:04.000,01:29:07.375,"YOU SEE, MR. BUCHANAN, I WANTED TO BE CLOSE."
01:29:13.917,01:29:15.542,DAISY AND I HAVE BOTH -- IT'S SO HOT!
01:29:15.583,01:29:17.709,EVERYTHING'S SO CONFUSED.
01:29:17.750,01:29:22.125,"WHAT'LL WE DO WITH OURSELVES THIS AFTERNOON OR THE DAY AFTER THAT, OR FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS?"
01:29:22.166,01:29:23.792,"OH, DON'T BE MORBID."
01:29:23.834,01:29:25.709,LET'S GO TO TOWN.
01:29:25.750,01:29:27.250,TOWN?
01:29:27.291,01:29:30.583,"UGH, WOMEN GET THESE NOTIONS."
01:29:49.125,01:29:51.041,DAISY.
01:29:56.375,01:29:58.166,YOU LOOK SO COOL.
01:30:00.875,01:30:03.375,YOU ALWAYS LOOK SO COOL...
01:30:03.417,01:30:08.250,LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENT OF THE MAN IN TIMES SQUARE.
01:30:08.291,01:30:11.792,"THE MAN IN THE COOL, BEAUTIFUL SHIRTS."
01:30:18.166,01:30:24.583,"SHE HAD TOLD GATSBY THAT SHE LOVED HIM, AND TOM HAD SEEN."
01:30:24.625,01:30:27.083,Tom: LET'S GO TO TOWN!
01:30:27.125,01:30:29.750,I'M PERFECTLY WILLING.
01:30:29.792,01:30:31.917,HENRI!
01:30:31.959,01:30:33.709,JUST LIKE THAT? CAN'T ANYONE AT LEAST HAVE A CIGARETTE FIRST?
01:30:33.750,01:30:35.166,WE'VE SMOKED ALL THROUGH LUNCH.
01:30:35.208,01:30:38.250,"COME ON, LET'S HAVE FUN."
01:30:38.291,01:30:39.959,"Tom: DAISY, IT WAS YOUR GREAT IDEA."
01:30:40.000,01:30:41.625,WHY DON'T WE?
01:30:41.667,01:30:44.250,"I CHANGED MY MIND, YOU BRUTE."
01:30:44.291,01:30:51.875,"COME ON. WE'LL GET A GREAT BIG ROOM AT THE PLAZA, A BUCKET OF ICE, A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, AND IT WILL BE FUN."
01:30:51.917,01:30:53.709,COME ON.
01:30:53.750,01:30:56.458,IT WAS YOUR IDEA.
01:30:56.500,01:30:58.959,FINE.
01:30:59.000,01:31:00.542,"COME ON, JORDAN."
01:31:04.917,01:31:08.917,"WILL YOU JOIN US, MR. GATSBY?"
01:31:08.959,01:31:10.709,TWO BOTTLES OF WHISKEY.
01:31:10.750,01:31:12.083,"COME ON, NICK!"
01:31:16.583,01:31:24.208,"MR. GATSBY, WOULD YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE MY COUPé AND I'LL DRIVE EVERYONE ELSE IN YOUR CIRCUS WAGON."
01:31:24.250,01:31:26.083,"I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH GAS, OLD SPORT."
01:31:26.125,01:31:28.208,"NO, PLENTY OF GAS."
01:31:28.250,01:31:31.375,"WELL, IF I RUN OUT, I'LL STOP AT A DRUGSTORE."
01:31:31.417,01:31:34.500,I HEAR YOU CAN BUY ANYTHING AT A DRUGSTORE NOWADAYS.
01:31:34.542,01:31:35.917,YOU TAKE NICK AND JORDAN.
01:31:35.959,01:31:38.542,"I SUPPOSE YOU CAN, YES."

01:31:40.500,01:31:43.417,I'LL BE THE MAN ON THE CORNER SMOKING TWO CIGARETTES!
01:31:49.208,01:31:52.458,"Tom: YOU MUST THINK I'M PRETTY DUMB, DON'T YOU?"
01:31:52.500,01:31:55.375,"WELL, I HAVE A SECOND SIGHT SOMETIMES THAT TELLS ME WHAT TO DO."
01:31:55.417,01:31:57.792,I'VE MADE A SMALL INVESTIGATION INTO THIS FELLOW.
01:31:57.834,01:31:59.333,AND YOU FOUND HE WAS AN OXFORD MAN?
01:31:59.375,01:32:00.667,"OXFORD, NEW MEXICO."
01:32:00.709,01:32:02.834,"HE WEARS A PINK SUIT, FOR CHRISSAKE."
01:32:16.709,01:32:18.959,Man: HEY!
01:32:26.542,01:32:30.375,"Jordan: TOM, WE'RE ALMOST OUTTA GAS."
01:32:36.041,01:32:38.792,Tom: WILSON!
01:32:38.834,01:32:41.208,WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!
01:32:42.500,01:32:43.917,DO I HAVE TO DO IT MYSELF?
01:32:43.959,01:32:45.875,YOU THINK I COME HERE TO ADMIRE THE VIEW?
01:32:45.917,01:32:47.125,"I'M SORRY, I'M -- I'M SICK."
01:32:47.166,01:32:48.500,WHY?
01:32:48.542,01:32:51.291,"WHY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?"
01:32:51.333,01:32:54.291,I'M -- I'M ALL RUN DOWN.
01:32:54.333,01:32:55.875,WHAT?
01:32:55.917,01:32:57.834,"MY WIFE AND I, WE WANNA GO WEST."
01:32:57.875,01:33:01.083,OH.
01:33:01.125,01:33:05.458,TOM WAS FEELING THE HOT WHIPS OF PANIC.
01:33:05.500,01:33:10.041,"HIS MISTRESS AND WIFE, AN HOUR AGO SO SECURE..."
01:33:10.083,01:33:11.625,I'M GONNA TAKE HER AWAY.
01:33:11.667,01:33:13.041,...WERE BOTH SLIPPING FROM HIS CONTROL.
01:33:13.083,01:33:17.959,"SEE, I WISED UP TO SOMETHIN' FUNNY THESE LAST TWO DAYS."
01:33:18.000,01:33:22.125,"YEAH, YEAH, SHE'S GOIN' WEST WHETHER SHE WANTS TO OR NOT."
01:33:22.166,01:33:23.875,WHAT DO I OWE YOU?!
01:33:23.917,01:33:28.542,$1. IT'S $1.20 YOU CAN HAVE THE CAR.
01:33:28.583,01:33:32.083,WHAT? WHAT?
01:34:22.875,01:34:25.083,"OKAY, FINE, FINE, FINE."
01:34:26.917,01:34:28.667,OPEN ANOTHER WINDOW.
01:34:28.709,01:34:30.917,THERE AREN'T ANY MORE.
01:34:30.959,01:34:32.417,THEN TELEPHONE FOR AN AXE.
01:34:32.458,01:34:34.333,Tom: WILL YOU FORGET ABOUT THE HEAT?
01:34:34.375,01:34:36.417,YOU MAKE IT WORSE BY CRABBING ABOUT IT.
01:34:36.458,01:34:38.000,"WHY NOT LET HER ALONE, OLD SPORT."
01:34:40.250,01:34:44.000,"THAT'S A GREAT EXPRESSION OF YOURS, ISN'T IT?"
01:34:44.041,01:34:45.291,WHAT IS?
01:34:45.333,01:34:47.458,OLD SPORT.
01:34:47.500,01:34:49.500,WHERE'D YOU PICK IT UP?
01:34:47.500,01:34:52.959,"NOW, SEE HERE, TOM, IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE PERSONAL REMARKS I WON'T STAY HERE A MINUTE."
01:34:53.000,01:34:56.625,"MR. GATSBY, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE AN OXFORD MAN."
01:35:00.291,01:35:02.583,"NO, NOT EXACTLY, NO."
01:35:02.625,01:35:05.333,"OH, YES, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WENT TO OXFORD."
01:35:06.834,01:35:08.291,"WELL, YES, I WENT THERE."
01:35:08.333,01:35:09.667,SURE.
01:35:09.709,01:35:12.291,THE MAN IN THE PINK SUIT WENT TO OXFORD.
01:35:12.333,01:35:15.542,TOM.
01:35:15.583,01:35:17.125,"Tom: OH, I HEARD YOU."
01:35:17.166,01:35:19.375,I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN.
01:35:19.417,01:35:21.709,YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN.
01:35:32.000,01:35:33.458,"WELL, MR. GATSBY?"
01:35:35.500,01:35:36.750,IT WAS IN 1919.
01:35:36.792,01:35:39.041,I ONLY STAYED THERE FIVE MONTHS.
01:35:39.083,01:35:42.166,THAT'S WHY I CAN'T EXACTLY CALL MYSELF AN OXFORD MAN.
01:35:42.208,01:35:47.500,"YOU SEE, IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THEY GAVE TO SOME OF US OFFICERS WHO -- WHO FOUGHT IN THE WAR."
01:35:49.583,01:35:53.667,I WANTED TO GET UP AND SLAP GATSBY ON THE BACK.
01:35:53.709,01:35:55.125,"I'LL MAKE YOU A DRINK, TOM."
01:35:55.166,01:35:57.166,THEN YOU WON'T SEEM SO STUPID TO YOURSELF.
01:35:57.208,01:35:58.542,WAIT A MINUTE.
01:35:58.583,01:36:00.709,I WANT TO ASK MR. GATSBY ONE MORE QUESTION.
01:36:00.750,01:36:03.583,"OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, GO ON, MR. BUCHANAN. GO ON."
01:36:03.625,01:36:08.000,WHAT KIND OF A ROW ARE YOU TRYING TO CAUSE IN MY HOUSE ANYHOW?
01:36:08.041,01:36:10.834,"HE ISN'T CAUSING A ROW, YOU'RE CAUSING A ROW."
01:36:10.875,01:36:12.542,PLEASE HAVE A LITTLE SELF-CONTROL.
01:36:12.583,01:36:14.875,SELF-CONTROL?
01:36:14.917,01:36:22.208,"OH, I SUPPOSE THE LATEST THING IS TO SIT BACK AND LET MR. NOBODY FROM NOWHERE MAKE LOVE TO YOUR WIFE."
01:36:22.250,01:36:25.250,"WELL, IF THAT'S THE IDEA, YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT."
01:36:25.291,01:36:29.709,"SEE, NOWADAYS PEOPLE BEGIN BY SNEERING AT FAMILY LIFE AND FAMILY INSTITUTIONS..."
01:36:29.750,01:36:35.333,THE NEXT YOU'LL KNOW WE'LL THROW EVERYTHING OVERBOARD AND WE'LL HAVE INTERMARRIAGE BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE!
01:36:35.375,01:36:37.000,Gatsby: YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.
01:36:41.917,01:36:45.875,SHE NEVER LOVED YOU.
01:36:49.875,01:36:51.792,YOU MUST BE CRAZY.
01:36:51.834,01:36:53.625,"NO, OLD SPORT."
01:36:53.667,01:36:57.625,"NO, YOU SEE, SHE NEVER LOVED YOU."
01:36:57.667,01:37:01.875,SHE ONLY MARRIED YOU BECAUSE I WAS POOR AND SHE WAS TIRED OF WAITING.
01:37:01.917,01:37:08.500,"IT WAS A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE MISTAKE, BUT IN HER HEART -- IN HER HEART -- SHE NEVER LOVED ANYONE BUT ME."
01:37:08.542,01:37:10.166,WE SHOULD GO.
01:37:10.208,01:37:12.208,"SIT DOWN, DAISY!"
01:37:12.250,01:37:13.792,Gatsby: PLEASE.
01:37:13.834,01:37:16.000,"PLEASE, TAKE A SEAT."
01:37:17.500,01:37:19.917,Tom: DAISY...
01:37:19.959,01:37:21.959,WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON?
01:37:22.000,01:37:24.083,I JUST TOLD YOU WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.
01:37:24.125,01:37:26.083,IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR FIVE YEARS.
01:37:26.125,01:37:28.458,YOU'VE BEEN SEEING HIM...
01:37:28.500,01:37:30.709,FOR FIVE YEARS?
01:37:30.750,01:37:34.166,"NO, NO, NO, NOT SEEING."
01:37:34.208,01:37:37.333,BUT BOTH OF US LOVED EACH OTHER ALL THAT TIME. DIDN'T WE?
01:37:37.375,01:37:38.709,"OH, THAT'S ALL."
01:37:41.458,01:37:46.417,I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW DAISY THEN.
01:37:46.458,01:37:52.542,AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF I SEE HOW YOU GOT WITHIN A MILE OF HER UNLESS YOU BROUGHT THE GROCERIES TO THE BACK DOOR.
01:37:52.583,01:37:55.458,BUT ALL THE REST OF THAT IS A GODDAMN LIE.
01:37:55.500,01:37:59.959,"DAISY LOVED ME WHEN SHE MARRIED ME, AND SHE LOVES ME NOW."
01:38:00.000,01:38:01.750,NO. NO.
01:38:01.792,01:38:03.583,"SHE DOES! SHE DOES, THOUGH."
01:38:03.625,01:38:06.375,"SHE DOES. AND WHAT'S MORE, I LOVE DAISY TOO."
01:38:06.417,01:38:08.625,NO.
01:38:08.667,01:38:10.750,"I LOVE YOU, DAISY."
01:38:10.792,01:38:13.458,"NOW, ONCE IN AWHILE, I-I GO OFF ON A SPREE."
01:38:13.500,01:38:15.500,I ALWAYS COME BACK.
01:38:15.542,01:38:16.959,A SPREE.
01:38:17.000,01:38:18.208,AND IN MY HEART I LOVE -- I LOVE HER ALL THE TIME.
01:38:18.250,01:38:19.709,YOU'RE REVOLTING.
01:38:19.750,01:38:21.375,DO YOU KNOW WHY WE LEFT CHICAGO?
01:38:21.417,01:38:24.834,I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T TREAT YOU TO THE STORY OF THAT LITTLE SPREE!
01:38:24.875,01:38:26.125,"THAT'S ALL OVER NOW, DAISY, DARLING."
01:38:26.166,01:38:27.750,THAT'S ALL OVER.
01:38:27.792,01:38:29.458,JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
01:38:29.500,01:38:33.208,THAT YOU NEVER LOVED HIM AND THIS -- THIS WILL ALL BE WIPED OUT FOREVER.
01:38:33.250,01:38:34.875,"HOW COULD I LOVE HIM, POSSIBLY?"
01:38:34.917,01:38:37.208,Gatsby: REMEMBER OUR PLANS.
01:38:37.250,01:38:42.625,"You tell him that you never loved him, and all this pain will be wiped out forever."
01:38:42.667,01:38:44.166,DAISY.
01:38:44.208,01:38:46.667,"DAISY, TELL HIM."
01:38:46.709,01:38:49.375,I-I NEVER LOVED HIM.
01:38:49.417,01:38:52.208,NEVER?
01:38:52.250,01:38:53.417,NO.
01:38:53.458,01:38:54.417,NO.
01:38:54.458,01:38:57.375,NOT AT KAPI'OLANI?
01:39:00.542,01:39:04.417,NOT THAT DAY I CARRIED YOU DOWN FROM THE PUNCH BOWL TO KEEP YOUR SHOES DRY?
01:39:08.500,01:39:10.250,NEVER?
01:39:10.291,01:39:12.959,PLEASE DON'T.
01:39:13.000,01:39:14.792,DAISY.
01:39:14.834,01:39:17.500,"THERE, JAY."
01:39:17.542,01:39:19.625,YOU WANT TOO MUCH.
01:39:19.667,01:39:22.208,"I LOVE YOU NOW, ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?"
01:39:22.250,01:39:24.041,I CAN'T HELP WHAT'S PAST.
01:39:24.083,01:39:26.583,"I DID LOVE HIM ONCE, BUT I LOVED YOU TOO."
01:39:29.125,01:39:31.792,YOU LOVED ME TOO?
01:39:31.834,01:39:34.291,YOU LOVED ME...?
01:39:34.333,01:39:35.583,SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YOU WERE ALIVE!
01:39:35.625,01:39:38.750,"THERE ARE THINGS BETWEEN DAISY AND ME, GATSBY, THAT YOU'LL NEVER KNOW."
01:39:38.792,01:39:40.709,THINGS THAT NEITHER OF US CAN EVER FORGET.
01:39:40.750,01:39:43.000,I JUST NEED TO SPEAK TO DAISY ALONE.
01:39:43.041,01:39:47.542,"YOU SEE, YOU'VE GOT HER ALL EXCITED NOW, DON'T YOU, OLD SPORT?"
01:39:47.583,01:39:48.917,EVEN ALONE I CAN'T SAY I NEVER LOVED TOM.
01:39:48.959,01:39:50.208,IT WOULDN'T BE TRUE.
01:39:50.250,01:39:51.792,OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T.
01:39:51.834,01:39:54.041,AS IF IT MATTERED TO YOU.
01:39:54.083,01:39:56.000,"SEE, I'M GONNA TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOU FROM NOW ON."
01:39:56.041,01:39:58.125,YOU'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF DAISY ANYMORE.
01:39:58.166,01:39:59.417,SHE'S LEAVING YOU.
01:39:59.458,01:40:01.500,NONSENSE!
01:40:01.542,01:40:02.834,"NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO."
01:40:02.875,01:40:05.083,"NO, SHE IS NOT LEAVING ME."
01:40:05.125,01:40:07.834,CERTAINLY NOT FOR A COMMON SWINDLER LIKE YOU.
01:40:07.875,01:40:10.500,"MR. GATSBY, EXACTLY WHO ARE YOU, ANYHOW?"
01:40:10.542,01:40:13.250,"YOU SEE, I HAVE MADE A SMALL INVESTIGATION INTO YOUR AFFAIRS."
01:40:13.291,01:40:14.583,YOU'RE ONE OF MEYER WOLFSHIEM'S BUNCH.
01:40:14.625,01:40:16.125,"PLEASE, LET'S GO HOME."
01:40:16.166,01:40:22.000,"SEE, HE AND THIS WOLFSHIEM, THEY BOUGHT UP A LOTTA DRUGSTORES AND SOLD BOOTLEGGED ALCOHOL OVER THE COUNTER."
01:40:22.041,01:40:23.500,"WHAT ABOUT IT, OLD SPORT?"
01:40:23.542,01:40:24.875,DON'T YOU CALL ME OLD SPORT.
01:40:24.917,01:40:30.709,AND THIS DRUGSTORE BUSINESS IS JUST SMALL CHANGE COMPARED TO THIS BONDS STUNT THAT YOU AND WOLFSHIEM HAVE GOT GOING ON.
01:40:30.750,01:40:33.750,"YOUR FRIEND WALTER CHASE ISN'T TOO PROUD TO COME IN ON IT, IS HE?"
01:40:33.792,01:40:36.208,I'VE BEEN GIVING THAT SOME THOUGHT.
01:40:36.250,01:40:39.959,HOW DOES A REPUTABLE BANKER LIKE WALTER CHASE FIND HIMSELF UP TO HIS EYEBALLS IN DEBT...
01:40:40.000,01:40:41.750,I'LL TELL YOU HOW.
01:40:41.792,01:40:42.917,"IT'S CALLED GREED, OLD SPORT."
01:40:42.959,01:40:44.166,HMM. THAT'S RIGHT!
01:40:44.208,01:40:50.208,AND YOU HAVE HALF OF WALL STREET OUT THERE SWILLING YOUR FREE BOOZE AT THAT FUN PARK EVERY WEEKEND.
01:40:50.250,01:40:51.792,I'M SURPRISED HE HASN'T TRIED TO DRAG YOU IN.
01:40:54.500,01:40:55.750,"MY GOD, HE HAS."
01:40:55.792,01:41:00.291,HE'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY -- WITH YOUR LITTLE RACKET.
01:41:00.333,01:41:02.208,DAISY.
01:41:02.250,01:41:03.792,DAISY.
01:41:03.834,01:41:11.667,CAN'T YOU SEE WHO THIS GUY IS WITH HIS HOUSE AND HIS PARTIES AND HIS FANCY CLOTHES?
01:41:11.709,01:41:19.375,"HE IS JUST A FRONT FOR WOLFSHIEM, A GANGSTER, TO GET HIS CLAWS INTO RESPECTABLE FOLK LIKE WALTER CHASE."
01:41:19.417,01:41:22.125,"THE ONLY RESPECTABLE THING ABOUT YOU, OLD SPORT, IS YOUR MONEY."
01:41:22.166,01:41:24.875,"YOUR MONEY, THAT'S IT."
01:41:24.917,01:41:27.500,NOW I'VE JUST AS MUCH AS YOU.
01:41:27.542,01:41:29.917,"OH, NO. NO."
01:41:29.959,01:41:32.291,I AM.
01:41:32.333,01:41:33.834,THEY ARE.
01:41:33.875,01:41:36.583,SHE IS.
01:41:36.625,01:41:40.875,"YOU SEE, WE WERE BORN DIFFERENT."
01:41:40.917,01:41:50.083,"IT'S IN OUR BLOOD, AND NOTHING THAT YOU DO OR SAY OR STEAL OR DREAM UP CAN EVER CHANGE THAT."
01:41:50.125,01:41:54.500,A GIRL LIKE DAISY -- YOU SHUT UP!
01:41:54.542,01:41:57.000,YOU SHUT UP!
01:41:57.041,01:41:59.583,SHUT UP!
01:42:06.291,01:42:12.291,GATSBY LOOKED IN THAT MOMENT AS IF HE HAD...
01:42:12.333,01:42:14.625,KILLED A MAN.
01:42:28.875,01:42:33.458,MY SINCEREST -- MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES.
01:42:37.166,01:42:39.291,I SEEM TO HAVE...
01:42:39.333,01:42:41.417,LOST MY TEMPER.
01:42:41.458,01:42:43.875,"THAT'S RIGHT, MR. GATSBY."
01:42:43.917,01:42:47.500,SHOW US SOME OF THOSE FINE OXFORD MANNERS.
01:42:47.542,01:42:49.000,"DAISY, DARLING."
01:42:49.041,01:42:53.125,NONE OF THIS HAS...ANY CONSEQUENCE.
01:42:53.166,01:42:55.125,DAISY.
01:42:55.166,01:42:57.583,"DAISY, TALK TO ME, DARLING."
01:42:57.625,01:43:00.125,"I JUST LOST MY TEMPER, THAT'S ALL."

01:52:45.917,01:52:48.208,"IT WASN'T HER FAULT, DAISY."

01:53:13.083,01:53:15.041,PROMISE ME.
01:53:15.083,01:53:20.041,"JAY, YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND GET SOME REST."

01:53:55.375,01:53:58.667,"THANK YOU, OLD SPORT."
01:54:04.750,01:54:07.375,"Tom: LISTEN, SHE WAS IN THE WRONG, RUNNING OUT ON THE ROAD."
01:54:07.417,01:54:10.792,"SWEETHEART, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT."

01:54:13.583,01:54:15.125,TAKE CARE OF YOU.
01:54:15.166,01:54:17.000,I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.
01:54:17.041,01:54:19.542,WE'LL GO AWAY.
01:54:19.583,01:54:22.500,"JUST GO AWAY, GET OUT OF TOWN."
01:54:22.542,01:54:24.291,GET SOME REST.
01:54:24.333,01:54:27.250,DON'T WORRY.
01:54:57.500,01:55:00.834,OH.

01:55:02.792,01:55:05.125,EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
01:55:05.166,01:55:07.667,YES.
01:55:07.709,01:55:11.333,"AROUND 4:00, SHE -- SHE CAME TO THE WINDOW."
01:55:11.375,01:55:19.542,"SHE STOOD THERE, THEN -- THEN SHE TURNED OUT THE LIGHT, SO, WELL..."
01:55:19.583,01:55:22.834,"GIVE ME A HAND, WILL YOU, OLD SPORT?"
01:55:22.875,01:55:26.750,I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM WHAT I HAD JUST SEEN.
01:55:26.792,01:55:34.166,"BUT ALL I COULD MANAGE WAS: YOU KNOW, JAY, WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED, YOU OUGHTA GO AWAY."
01:55:34.208,01:55:36.208,TONIGHT.
01:55:36.250,01:55:37.875,GO AWAY?
01:55:37.917,01:55:39.375,NOT TONIGHT.
01:55:39.417,01:55:41.250,"JAY, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT A WOMAN HAS BEEN KILLED?"
01:55:41.291,01:55:43.083,DAISY'S GOING TO CALL IN THE MORNING.
01:55:43.125,01:55:46.458,THEN WE'LL MAKE PLANS TO GO AWAY TOGETHER.
01:55:46.500,01:55:48.291,YEAH.
01:55:48.333,01:55:52.166,"UH, DAISY, SHE -- SHE JUST NEEDS TIME TO THINK THINGS THROUGH."
01:55:52.208,01:55:54.166,"HERZOG, WE'RE TALKING."
01:55:57.959,01:56:00.000,SHE JUST NEEDS TIME TO THINK.
01:56:00.041,01:56:02.917,"NO, JAY."
01:56:00.041,01:56:05.333,WITH DAISY -- SHE JUST NEEDS TIME TO THINK.
01:56:05.375,01:56:08.208,SHE'S GOING TO CALL IN THE MORNING.
01:56:15.417,01:56:18.667,WAIT UP WITH ME.
01:56:21.583,01:56:23.417,THE SUN'S ALMOST UP.
01:56:27.083,01:56:31.000,THAT WAS THE NIGHT HE FINALLY TOLD ME THE TRUTH.
01:56:31.041,01:56:33.291,ALL OF IT.
01:56:35.125,01:56:42.875,"YOU KNOW, I'VE THOUGHT FOR A WHILE I HAD A LOT OF THINGS, BUT THE TRUTH IS I'M -- I'M EMPTY."
01:56:42.917,01:56:46.291,I SUPPOSE THAT'S WHY I MAKE THINGS UP ABOUT MYSELF.
01:56:46.333,01:56:51.542,BUT I'VE WANTED TO TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
01:56:51.583,01:56:55.000,"SEE, I GREW UP TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY POOR, OLD SPORT."
01:56:55.041,01:56:56.583,MY FOLKS WERE...
01:56:56.625,01:57:08.583,"HE REVEALED HIS HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, HIS TRANSFORMATIVE VOYAGE WITH DAN CODY, THE WAR, OXFORD, AND HOW HE JOINED WOLFSHIEM IN THE BUSINESS."
01:57:08.625,01:57:15.458,IT WAS ALSO THAT NIGHT THAT I BECAME AWARE OF GATSBY'S EXTRAORDINARY GIFT FOR HOPE.
01:57:15.500,01:57:20.291,"I CAN'T DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO FIND OUT THAT I LOVED HER, OLD SPORT, AND THAT SHE LOVED ME TOO."
01:57:20.333,01:57:23.417,A GIFT THAT I HAVE NEVER FOUND IN ANY OTHER PERSON.
01:57:23.458,01:57:27.250,I NEVER REALIZED HOW EXTRAORDINARY A NICE GIRL COULD BE.
01:57:27.291,01:57:31.500,AND WHICH IT IS NOT LIKELY I SHALL EVER FIND AGAIN.
01:57:31.542,01:57:36.959,"I THOUGHT OUT MY LIFE WITH DAISY IN IT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD MARRY AND STRUGGLE ALONG ON SO MANY DOLLARS A MONTH."
01:57:37.000,01:57:40.250,WHAT WAS IN THE LETTER?
01:57:42.000,01:57:47.583,THE REASON WHY AFTER THE WAR I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO RETURN.
01:57:47.625,01:57:53.375,"I ASKED HER TO WAIT UNTIL I MADE SOMETHING OF MYSELF, BUT SHE WAS..."
01:57:53.417,01:57:56.500,"SEE, I FELT MARRIED TO HER."
01:57:58.792,01:58:01.583,THAT WAS ALL.
01:58:01.625,01:58:03.583,IT WAS ALL FOR HER.
01:58:03.625,01:58:06.041,"THE HOUSE, THE PARTIES."
01:58:06.083,01:58:07.500,EVERYTHING.
01:58:14.875,01:58:17.291,George: GOD SEES EVERYTHING.
01:58:25.792,01:58:27.875,"Herzog: MR. GATSBY, SIR, EXCUSE ME."
01:58:27.917,01:58:29.834,"CHICAGO CALLING, SIR."
01:58:29.875,01:58:31.583,NOT NOW.
01:58:31.625,01:58:34.667,KEEP IT OPEN FOR A PERSONAL CALL.
01:58:34.709,01:58:37.250,A PERSONAL CALL?
01:58:37.291,01:58:41.917,"Man: EXCUSE ME, SIR. MR. GATSBY, I'M GONNA DRAIN THE POOL TODAY, BEFORE THE LEAVES START FALLING IN."
01:58:41.959,01:58:45.083,NOT TODAY.
01:58:45.125,01:58:48.291,"NOT TODAY, IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL."
01:58:48.333,01:58:53.166,"YOU KNOW, OLD SPORT, I HAVEN'T USED THAT POOL ONCE ALL SUMMER."
01:58:53.208,01:58:54.667,LET'S TAKE A SWIM.
01:58:54.709,01:58:57.917,HAVE THE PHONE BROUGHT DOWN TO THE POOL.
01:59:11.125,01:59:13.667,"I HAVE TO GO, JAY."
01:59:15.500,01:59:17.291,I HAVE TO WORK.
01:59:17.333,01:59:20.542,I UNDERSTAND.
01:59:20.583,01:59:23.500,"WELL, I'LL WALK YOU OUT."
01:59:31.000,01:59:34.583,"WELL, I'LL CALL YOU UP."
01:59:34.625,01:59:37.500,"PLEASE DO, OLD SPORT."
01:59:39.083,01:59:43.083,I SUPPOSE THAT DAISY WILL CALL TOO.
01:59:46.083,01:59:48.792,I...
01:59:48.834,01:59:50.667,I SUPPOSE.
01:59:50.709,01:59:53.583,YES.
01:59:53.625,01:59:57.000,"WELL, GOODBYE."
02:00:15.291,02:00:18.583,JAY!
02:00:18.625,02:00:20.834,THEY'RE A ROTTEN CROWD.
02:00:22.458,02:00:25.625,YOU'RE WORTH THE WHOLE DAMN BUNCH PUT TOGETHER.
02:00:35.041,02:00:38.083,I WAS ALWAYS GLAD I SAID THAT.
02:00:38.125,02:00:42.625,IT WAS THE ONLY COMPLIMENT I EVER PAID HIM.
02:00:46.333,02:00:52.333,THAT MORNING WALL STREET BOOMED ITS USUAL GOLDEN ROAR.
02:00:52.375,02:00:57.083,BUT I WASN'T WORTH A DECENT STROKE OF WORK.
02:00:57.125,02:01:00.208,I WAITED FOR GATSBY TO CALL WITH NEWS.
02:01:00.250,02:01:05.291,WHILE HE WAITED...FOR DAISY.
02:01:48.083,02:01:50.291,Herzog: GATSBY'S.
02:01:50.333,02:01:53.875,I KNOW MR. GATSBY WILL BE VERY HAPPY THAT YOU'VE CALLED.
02:02:15.875,02:02:18.709,Daisy.
02:02:39.041,02:02:40.750,HELLO!
02:02:40.792,02:02:42.208,HELLO!
02:02:42.250,02:02:44.709,Hello!
02:02:49.792,02:02:51.959,HELLO!
02:02:52.000,02:02:53.291,HELLO!
02:02:53.333,02:02:54.500,HELLO!
02:02:54.542,02:02:57.208,HELLO!
02:03:06.750,02:03:16.041,I REMEMBER THE REST OF THAT DAY AS AN ENDLESS DRILL OF POLICE AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND TABLOID REPORTERS.
02:03:16.083,02:03:18.709,THE HEADLINES WERE A NIGHTMARE.
02:03:18.750,02:03:21.875,THEY PINNED EVERYTHING ON GATSBY.
02:03:21.917,02:03:23.959,THE AFFAIR WITH MYRTLE.
02:03:24.041,02:03:26.750,THE HIT AND RUN.
02:03:26.792,02:03:34.083,AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD SAY EXCEPT THE ONE UNUTTERABLE FACT THAT NONE OF IT WAS TRUE.
02:03:34.125,02:03:38.083,"DARLING, DADDY'S TAKING CARE OF HIS TWO FAVORITE GIRLS."
02:03:38.125,02:03:39.625,WHERE ARE WE GOING?
02:03:39.667,02:03:41.166,WE'RE GOING ON A HOLIDAY.
02:03:41.208,02:03:42.667,Tom: WE SHOULD GO.
02:03:42.709,02:03:45.375,"JUST YOU, ME AND DADDY."
02:03:47.333,02:03:48.500,BUCHANAN RESIDENCE.
02:03:48.542,02:03:50.500,NICK: May I speak to Mrs. Buchanan?
02:03:50.542,02:03:53.291,"IT'S MR. CARRAWAY, HER COUSIN."
02:03:53.333,02:03:55.375,"MADAME IS NOT AVAILABLE, MONSIEUR CARRAWAY."
02:03:55.417,02:03:58.709,"IF YOU SPEAK TO HER, TELL HER THE FUNERAL'S TOMORROW."
02:03:58.750,02:04:00.208,"I'M SORRY, MONSIEUR, THEY HAVE GONE AWAY."
02:04:00.250,02:04:01.792,Gone away?
02:04:01.834,02:04:03.792,DO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'LL BE BACK?
02:04:05.417,02:04:07.333,NO.
02:04:07.375,02:04:09.500,They have already departed.
02:04:12.792,02:04:14.500,PLEASE.
02:04:14.542,02:04:19.792,I KNOW THAT SHE WOULD WANT TO BE THERE. SHE WOULD -- IF YOU WOULD JUST GET A MESSAGE TO HER.
02:04:19.834,02:04:21.875,"Let me talk to her, please."
02:04:21.917,02:04:23.583,YOU WISH TO CONTACT HER?
02:04:23.625,02:04:25.792,"I HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION, MONSIEUR."
02:04:25.834,02:04:27.000,PLEASE!
02:04:27.041,02:04:28.166,Au revoir.
02:04:28.208,02:04:32.917,I -- HELLO?
02:04:37.125,02:04:40.166,COME ON.
02:04:40.208,02:04:43.542,"THEY WERE CARELESS PEOPLE, TOM AND DAISY."
02:04:43.583,02:04:51.291,THEY SMASHED UP THINGS AND PEOPLE AND THEN RETREATED BACK INTO THEIR MONEY AND THEIR VAST CARELESSNESS.
02:04:52.792,02:04:54.250,HEY.
02:04:54.291,02:04:56.083,HEY!
02:04:56.125,02:04:59.500,GO ON!
02:05:12.375,02:05:18.041,"I RANG, I WROTE, I IMPLORED."
02:05:18.083,02:05:27.208,BUT NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THE SPARKLING HUNDREDS THAT HAD ENJOYED HIS HOSPITALITY ATTENDED THE FUNERAL.
02:05:27.250,02:05:33.291,AND FROM DAISY NOT EVEN A FLOWER.
02:05:33.333,02:05:36.208,I WAS ALL HE HAD.
02:05:36.250,02:05:39.458,THE ONLY ONE WHO CARED.
02:06:09.959,02:06:16.667,AFTER GATSBY'S DEATH NEW YORK WAS HAUNTED FOR ME.
02:06:16.709,02:06:27.959,"THAT CITY, MY ONCE GOLDEN, SHIMMERING MIRAGE, NOW MADE ME SICK."
02:06:31.291,02:06:39.458,"ON MY LAST NIGHT IN NEW YORK I RETURNED TO THAT HUGE, INCOHERENT HOUSE ONCE MORE."
02:06:39.500,02:06:43.375,WOLFSHIEM'S ASSOCIATES HAD CLEANED IT OUT.
02:06:43.417,02:06:46.583,HE THREW ALL THOSE PARTIES HOPING SHE'D WANDER IN ONE NIGHT.
02:06:46.625,02:06:48.375,IT'S LIKE AN AMUSEMENT PARK.
02:06:48.417,02:06:50.417,DO YOU LIVE HERE ALL ALONE?
02:06:50.458,02:06:54.208,"Gatsby: SHE MAKES IT LOOK SO -- SO SPLENDID, DON'T YOU THINK, OLD SPORT?"
02:06:54.250,02:06:55.583,MUSIC!
02:06:55.625,02:06:59.125,AND THEN WE CAN DANCE ALL NIGHT!
02:06:59.166,02:07:01.750,"Gatsby: WILL YOU COME, OLD SPORT? WE NEED YOU."
02:07:01.792,02:07:04.750,Daisy: I WISH IT COULD ALWAYS BE LIKE THIS.
02:07:04.792,02:07:07.625,IT WILL BE.
02:07:07.667,02:07:20.417,I REMEMBERED HOW WE HAD ALL COME TO GATSBY'S AND GUESSED AT HIS CORRUPTION WHILE HE STOOD BEFORE US CONCEALING AN INCORRUPTIBLE DREAM.
02:07:20.458,02:07:21.917,IT'S PERFECT.
02:07:21.959,02:07:26.041,"FROM YOUR PERFECT, IRRESISTIBLE IMAGINATION."
02:07:31.625,02:07:34.291,THE MOON ROSE HIGHER.
02:07:34.333,02:07:46.125,"AND AS I STOOD THERE, BROODING ON THE OLD, UNKNOWN WORLD, I THOUGHT OF GATSBY'S WONDER WHEN HE FIRST PICKED OUT THE GREEN LIGHT AT THE END OF DAISY'S DOCK."
02:07:50.834,02:07:54.166,HE HAD COME SUCH A LONG WAY.
02:07:54.208,02:08:01.709,AND HIS DREAM MUST HAVE SEEMED SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD HARDLY FAIL TO GRASP IT.
02:08:04.083,02:08:09.542,BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS ALREADY BEHIND HIM.
02:08:09.583,02:08:18.166,"GATSBY BELIEVED IN THE GREEN LIGHT, THE ORGASTIC FUTURE THAT YEAR BY YEAR RECEDES BEFORE US."
02:08:18.208,02:08:21.458,"IT ELUDED US THEN, BUT THAT'S NO MATTER."
02:08:21.500,02:08:29.500,"TOMORROW, WE WILL RUN FASTER, STRETCH OUT OUR ARMS FARTHER, AND ONE FINE MORNING..."
02:08:29.542,02:08:41.208,"SO WE BEAT ON, BOATS AGAINST THE CURRENT, BORNE BACK CEASELESSLY INTO THE PAST."
