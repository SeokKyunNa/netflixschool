00:01:47.482,00:01:49.568,Boy: Mister?
00:01:49.610,00:01:51.236,Mister?
00:02:26.271,00:02:29.733,"Woman: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to San Jose International Airport."
00:02:56.802,00:03:01.515,Look out! Watch out!
00:03:01.556,00:03:02.766,Help!
00:03:02.808,00:03:04.518,-Adam?!
00:03:04.559,00:03:06.020,Adam?!
00:03:06.061,00:03:09.230,Somebody call 911!
00:03:09.272,00:03:11.483,"Oh, my God!"
00:03:11.525,00:03:15.821,"I'm a doctor, let me take a look. Let me take a look."
00:03:15.863,00:03:17.156,His jugular vein's been cut.
00:03:17.196,00:03:18.197,Does anyone have a clean cloth?
00:03:18.239,00:03:19.449,Please. Someone!
00:03:19.491,00:03:20.784,I have a fresh change of clothes in my bag.
00:03:20.826,00:03:21.743,That's great.
00:03:31.879,00:03:34.255,You're killing him.
00:03:34.297,00:03:36.175,I'm saving his life.
00:03:36.216,00:03:38.052,N-- You have it in the wrong place.
00:03:38.093,00:03:41.221,I think I remember enough of Anatomy 101 to know where the jugular vein is.
00:03:41.262,00:03:43.515,You would be in the right place if he were an adult.
00:03:43.557,00:03:45.475,He's not an adult.
00:03:45.517,00:03:47.853,Which means you're also putting pressure on his trachea.
00:03:47.895,00:03:51.982,Which means he's not currently breathing.
00:03:52.024,00:03:54.902,You have to put the pressure higher up.
00:03:58.655,00:04:00.115,There.
00:04:00.157,00:04:02.159,-Oh.
00:04:10.918,00:04:13.879,Some glass.
00:04:13.921,00:04:15.547,Who are you?
00:04:15.589,00:04:18.050,Hello.
00:04:18.092,00:04:21.428,I'm a surgical resident at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
00:04:21.469,00:04:38.987,-- Captions by VITAC -- Autism -- a mental condition characterized by difficulty in communicating and using language and abstract concepts.
00:04:39.029,00:04:40.614,That's the definition.
00:04:40.655,00:04:42.950,Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?
00:04:42.991,00:04:45.077,He's not Rain Man.
00:04:45.119,00:04:50.207,"He's high functioning, he's capable of living on his own, capable of managing his own affairs."
00:04:50.249,00:04:52.167,High functioning?
00:04:52.209,00:04:54.419,Is that our new hiring standard?
00:04:54.461,00:04:55.670,"If it were, you wouldn't be here."
00:04:55.712,00:04:58.882,I'm sorry. Is this really necessary? Really?
00:04:58.924,00:05:05.889,A special meeting of the Board of Directors -- as much as I love you all -- questioning one of my hiring decisions?
00:05:05.931,00:05:09.559,Did you bother to look up the definition of President while you were skimming the dictionary?
00:05:09.601,00:05:15.107,You're hiring him to be a surgical resident -- my department -- over my objections.
00:05:15.149,00:05:17.484,"Marcus, stop making everything so personal."
00:05:17.525,00:05:18.735,I made it personal?
00:05:18.777,00:05:20.279,You've wanted his job since day one.
00:05:20.320,00:05:21.571,Everyone in this room knows that.
00:05:21.613,00:05:23.991,"And, Aaron, yes, this is your hospital."
00:05:24.032,00:05:26.743,But the money it takes to run it comes from the Foundation I control.
00:05:26.785,00:05:29.496,"So let's all play nice, shall we?"
00:05:29.537,00:05:31.623,Stop acting like you're stunned that you're standing there.
00:05:31.665,00:05:32.958,You tried to slip one past us.
00:05:33.000,00:05:36.253,I vetted him like I would any other candidate.
00:05:36.295,00:05:44.261,And you genuinely thought that this Board wouldn't reasonably have any doubts about hiring a surgeon who's been diagnosed with autism?
00:05:44.303,00:05:46.263,So justify your decision.
00:05:48.807,00:05:51.935,I met Shaun Murphy when he was 14 years old.
00:05:51.977,00:05:54.437,I was living in Wyoming at the time.
00:05:54.479,00:05:58.357,"He was, and he still is, an extraordinary young man."
00:05:58.399,00:06:05.073,"Yes, he has autism, but he also has savant syndrome -- genius-level skills in several areas."
00:06:05.115,00:06:08.827,He has almost perfect recall.
00:06:08.869,00:06:14.749,And he sees things and analyzes things in ways that -- that are just remarkable.
00:06:14.791,00:06:17.794,In ways that we can't even begin to understand.
00:06:17.836,00:06:20.379,Those are assets.
00:06:17.836,00:06:23.424,"Undeniable assets for any doctor, particularly a surgeon."
00:06:26.053,00:06:28.972,You've known him since he was 14?
00:06:29.014,00:06:31.183,You care about him.
00:06:31.225,00:06:34.353,"Dr. Andrews, your wife is gonna be very upset with you."
00:06:34.393,00:06:38.857,"If you're trying to turn this into a nepotism case, we're gonna have to fire her idiot nephew from bookkeeping."
00:06:45.906,00:06:47.074,Hey!
00:06:47.115,00:06:48.367,Sorry. You seen Claire?
00:06:48.407,00:06:49.534,Would you turn off the light?
00:06:49.576,00:06:50.702,Sure. You seen Claire?
00:06:50.744,00:06:52.954,Why? Would you turn off the light?
00:06:52.996,00:06:56.708,"Melendez wants to operate on 104, but Claire hasn't gotten informed consent."
00:06:56.750,00:06:59.253,And she's ignoring her page.
00:06:59.294,00:07:01.338,No. Now go away and turn off the light.
00:07:01.380,00:07:04.132,Sure.
00:07:10.638,00:07:12.349,"They need you to, um..."
00:07:16.644,00:07:18.355,"Oh, she's such a bitch."
00:07:19.647,00:07:21.524,No.
00:07:21.566,00:07:23.402,She just doesn't like you.
00:07:23.443,00:07:27.072,Hmm.
00:07:27.114,00:07:28.740,"It's kind of silly, isn't it?"
00:07:28.782,00:07:31.868,"Um, maybe."
00:07:31.910,00:07:34.913,"To say for sure, I'd need to know what it is you're talking about."
00:07:34.955,00:07:36.373,Us.
00:07:36.415,00:07:39.667,Ah. Hmm.
00:07:39.709,00:07:41.336,"Quite a bit of fun, actually."
00:07:41.378,00:07:44.714,I meant that we're hiding it.
00:07:44.756,00:07:48.302,Hmm. Well...
00:07:48.343,00:07:52.055,"Jared, we don't have a relationship."
00:07:52.097,00:07:54.766,We have sex.
00:07:54.808,00:08:03.650,"But, if you want to tell people that you're screwing me, go for it."
00:08:27.841,00:08:29.968,The veins in the boy's left arm are popping.
00:08:30.010,00:08:31.136,Is that bad?
00:08:31.178,00:08:32.346,I-I don't see.
00:08:32.387,00:08:33.930,Intrathoracic pressure.
00:08:33.972,00:08:35.765,"No, his chest is rising."
00:08:35.807,00:08:39.144,"No, the -- the chest is moving paradoxically."
00:08:39.186,00:08:40.979,The left lung is in distress.
00:08:48.445,00:08:51.906,Yes.
00:08:51.948,00:08:58.205,"Who here has a sharp knife, blade five inches or longer?"
00:08:58.246,00:08:59.539,Nobody?
00:08:59.580,00:09:01.291,You should start artificial respiration.
00:09:01.333,00:09:04.085,He's going to stop breathing very soon.
00:09:08.382,00:09:10.550,-I feel fine.
00:09:08.382,00:09:12.802,-Dr. Melendez would like to do the surgery today.
00:09:12.844,00:09:15.972,You need bypass surgery quite urgently.
00:09:16.014,00:09:18.850,Would you please sign the consent?
00:09:18.892,00:09:20.227,No.
00:09:20.268,00:09:21.478,You're scared.
00:09:21.520,00:09:22.854,I-I'm not scared.
00:09:22.896,00:09:23.813,"Well, you should be."
00:09:23.855,00:09:28.235,"We're gonna cut your chest open, we're gonna stop your heart, repair it and restart it."
00:09:28.276,00:09:30.737,Are you seriously telling me that that doesn't scare you?
00:09:30.778,00:09:32.822,I just want a second opinion.
00:09:32.864,00:09:36.784,"Callum, yesterday, your life was perfect."
00:09:36.826,00:09:39.787,"You were playing tennis, you had a big anniversary."
00:09:39.829,00:09:47.628,"Today, you're lying in a hospital bed trying to figure out the best way to say goodbye, maybe forever, to your teenage children."
00:09:47.670,00:09:49.089,Why are you doing this?
00:09:49.130,00:09:52.342,Because I can't deal with lies.
00:09:52.384,00:09:55.554,"If you lie to me, my answers won't help you."
00:09:55.595,00:10:00.392,"But, if you're scared, I can help you."
00:10:03.270,00:10:04.687,I'm scared.
00:10:04.729,00:10:06.647,Okay.
00:10:10.110,00:10:12.279,-You can't be back here.
00:10:12.320,00:10:15.115,Where do you keep the knives people forget they're traveling with?
00:10:15.156,00:10:17.617,A knife?
00:10:17.658,00:10:28.253,"I do also need a narrow six-foot tube and high-proof alcohol and gloves and baggage-handling tape, but I am going to get the alcohol from the duty-free store and the tube from the back of a soda machine."
00:10:28.295,00:10:29.963,"Well, I wish you all the luck with that."
00:10:30.004,00:10:31.214,But I'm not gonna give you a knife.
00:10:31.256,00:10:33.633,"No, I need a knife."
00:10:31.256,00:10:37.053,It-It's -- It's very -- There is a medical emergency.
00:10:37.095,00:10:40.223,"That one. That one, right near the top, looks very sharp."
00:10:40.265,00:10:41.391,Would you get it for me?
00:10:41.433,00:10:42.934,"No, I'm not gonna give you a knife."
00:10:42.976,00:10:46.229,I'll ask -- There's not the time.
00:10:46.271,00:10:48.773,Weapon! Weapon!
00:10:50.233,00:10:52.402,Move!
00:10:55.029,00:10:57.240,Drop it.
00:10:57.282,00:10:59.700,You idiot! You're lucky we didn't just shoot.
00:10:59.742,00:11:03.121,No! He's trying to save my son's life.
00:11:10.795,00:11:12.671,You get that consent on 104?
00:11:12.713,00:11:14.341,"Well, I made him a deal."
00:11:14.382,00:11:20.972,"He's got a meeting with Dr. Max from psychiatry at 6:00, we'll get the consent by 8:00, we can operate first thing in the morning."
00:11:21.014,00:11:22.557,"You did pass anatomy, right, Dr. Browne?"
00:11:22.599,00:11:24.142,"His problem's in his heart, not his head."
00:11:24.184,00:11:26.019,He's not psychologically ready for surgery.
00:11:26.060,00:11:27.187,He will be. Soon.
00:11:27.228,00:11:28.563,"Well, he is physically ready."
00:11:28.605,00:11:30.565,"So, get the consent."
00:11:30.607,00:11:35.987,Do I need to cite you the 17 studies that show a correlation between attitude and outcome in surgical patients?
00:11:36.029,00:11:39.698,Do I need to remind you that I am your superior?
00:11:39.740,00:11:43.786,"You do know what the opposite of superior is, right?"
00:11:43.828,00:11:47.415,Subordinate. Doesn't -- Sure. Subordinate.
00:11:47.457,00:11:48.291,Either way.
00:11:48.333,00:11:49.959,It doesn't mean I'm wrong.
00:11:50.001,00:11:51.961,I suppose not.
00:11:52.003,00:11:57.258,But it does mean you have to act like you're wrong.
00:11:57.300,00:11:58.717,He's panic stricken.
00:11:58.759,00:12:00.761,"Yesterday, he was young and healthy."
00:12:00.803,00:12:02.180,"Today, he's mortal."
00:12:02.222,00:12:05.058,Just give him a chance to wrap his head around that.
00:12:10.021,00:12:12.524,Dr. Kalu?
00:12:12.566,00:12:17.404,Do you think you can get me a signed informed consent on 104?
00:12:17.445,00:12:18.238,Of course.
00:12:18.279,00:12:20.281,Thank you.
00:12:23.159,00:12:25.119,You think he's right?
00:12:25.161,00:12:29.207,I think he's my boss.
00:12:29.249,00:12:32.627,And if I have to choose between my boss and...
00:12:32.669,00:12:40.051,"the woman I'm screwing, not much of a choice, am I right?"
00:12:42.512,00:12:45.764,Shaun: Excuse me.
00:13:33.563,00:13:37.024,The incision should take place two ribs down.
00:14:04.761,00:14:06.220,"Okay, well, why the bottle?"
00:14:06.262,00:14:10.391,The air will continue to leak and accumulate until the damage can be properly repaired.
00:14:10.433,00:14:11.976,The tube allows the air to get out.
00:14:12.018,00:14:14.270,The water in the bottle stops the air from coming back in.
00:14:14.312,00:14:16.314,A homemade one-way valve.
00:14:18.483,00:14:20.193,He's breathing.
00:14:22.028,00:14:24.572,You saved his life.
00:14:24.614,00:14:26.366,He saved his life!
00:14:38.336,00:14:39.920,"Woman: 235 to Seattle, now departing from Gate B42."
00:14:39.962,00:14:45.218,"Shaun, where are you? I-I -- -Call me as soon as you can, please."
00:14:45.259,00:14:46.761,That was a mistake.
00:14:45.259,00:14:48.805,"I agree, 'cause it's not about the new doctor, this is about you."
00:14:48.847,00:14:50.724,They're baiting you.
00:14:50.765,00:14:51.891,Maybe.
00:14:51.932,00:14:53.351,What mistake are you talking about?
00:14:53.393,00:14:54.686,Your shot at Andrews' nephew.
00:14:54.728,00:14:56.604,"Oh, come on."
00:14:56.646,00:14:58.939,It was very funny.
00:14:58.981,00:15:00.107,"Well, you don't show him respect."
00:15:00.149,00:15:01.942,I assume it's because you don't respect him.
00:15:01.984,00:15:04.945,"You show someone respect because you respect them, or because you're afraid of them."
00:15:04.987,00:15:06.531,I don't fit into either category.
00:15:06.573,00:15:07.866,"Well, neither do I."
00:15:07.907,00:15:09.992,You should.
00:15:10.034,00:15:16.332,You're only in that room because your grandfather founded this hospital.
00:15:16.374,00:15:22.963,"I'm gonna pretend that this conversation didn't take this tangent, and instead focus on something relevant -- the debate you are losing."
00:15:23.005,00:15:24.424,Here's how you win this.
00:15:24.465,00:15:27.176,You don't make it personal.
00:15:27.218,00:15:32.807,"That is what they want, and if you give it to them, you will lose."
00:15:34.893,00:15:38.354,I need to get to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
00:15:38.396,00:15:39.564,That's where we're going.
00:15:39.606,00:15:41.107,Good.
00:15:47.655,00:15:51.367,Ethan: How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?!
00:15:51.409,00:15:53.620,-He doesn't know how.
00:15:53.661,00:15:55.580,What are we supposed to do now? Huh?
00:15:55.622,00:15:57.707,This is the third school he's been thrown out of.
00:15:57.749,00:15:58.875,We'll find another school.
00:15:58.917,00:16:00.627,"No, we won't, 'cause nothing's gonna change."
00:16:00.668,00:16:04.547,"They can't handle him, and I don't blame them, 'cause obviously, we can't handle him, either."
00:16:04.589,00:16:05.965,What the hell happened this time?
00:16:06.006,00:16:07.634,What happened?!
00:16:07.675,00:16:08.760,You're hurting him.
00:16:11.471,00:16:12.931,What did you do?!
00:16:12.972,00:16:14.891,Shaun!
00:16:14.933,00:16:16.935,Will you stop petting that stupid rabbit?!
00:16:29.864,00:16:32.283,It changed.
00:16:32.325,00:16:35.578,The boy's ECG changed.
00:16:35.620,00:16:38.080,It's the same -- 86 BPM.
00:16:38.122,00:16:40.333,No. It used to be higher.
00:16:40.374,00:16:42.794,"No, it used to be 86."
00:16:42.836,00:16:45.880,It used to come up to here.
00:16:45.922,00:16:47.799,Lower amplitude means lower voltage.
00:16:47.841,00:16:50.009,Lower amplitude means lower voltage.
00:16:50.050,00:16:51.594,What's going on?
00:16:51.636,00:16:55.890,It means he's trying to read 20-year-old equipment while traveling in a vehicle going 40 miles an hour.
00:16:57.725,00:16:59.143,How did you get him to sign?
00:16:59.185,00:17:06.192,"I simply told him it was either consenting or going home, then I gave him two forms and told him to pick one."
00:17:06.233,00:17:12.907,Melendez: And you highlighted the Release Against Medical Advice form that mentions the possibility of death or permanent disability?
00:17:12.949,00:17:14.074,Well done.
00:17:14.116,00:17:15.827,Hand me the Metz and a pick-up.
00:17:15.869,00:17:17.286,I'm isolating the descending aorta.
00:17:17.328,00:17:20.373,Sarah: Vascular clamp.
00:17:20.414,00:17:21.916,What is that?
00:17:21.958,00:17:23.417,Under the left atrium...
00:17:23.459,00:17:26.045,something white.
00:17:26.086,00:17:28.798,Is that part of the lung?
00:17:28.840,00:17:31.425,Melendez: It's pus.
00:17:31.467,00:17:32.593,Did he have TB?
00:17:32.635,00:17:34.971,"No, he doesn't have any-- No, not currently."
00:17:33.803,00:17:37.306,"Does he have a history-- When he was younger, he was exposed to -- This is an abscess."
00:17:36.180,00:17:41.519,It's gonna bur-- Suction and a lap sponge.
00:17:41.561,00:17:42.979,Two liters saline wide open.
00:17:43.021,00:17:45.773,Set up the level one.
00:17:45.815,00:17:48.442,Get Levophed on board and keep that MAP at 60.
00:17:48.484,00:17:50.486,Get in there with the suction.
00:17:50.528,00:17:52.739,Suction.
00:17:52.780,00:17:57.451,I hope it isn't too upsetting to him when he hears he would have died in his room if we'd waited until tomorrow.
00:17:57.493,00:18:03.165,"Dr. Melendez, we've got an incoming 8-year-old male, pneumothorax stabilized, but undetermined internal injuries."
00:18:03.207,00:18:04.375,Who do you want to catch?
00:18:04.417,00:18:06.377,"Claire, I don't think we need you."
00:18:06.419,00:18:09.714,This patient is gonna be fine...now.
00:18:12.383,00:18:15.469,"8-year-old healthy boy, status post encounter with a shattered glass sign."
00:18:15.511,00:18:16.679,Numerous lacerations.
00:18:16.721,00:18:21.100,"-Echo -- -Get him set up in Trauma 3 with an EKG, full blood work and a pan-scan."
00:18:21.141,00:18:23.143,We need an echo-- echocardiogram.
00:18:23.185,00:18:24.311,Who is this guy?
00:18:24.353,00:18:25.813,He helped with first-aid at the airport.
00:18:25.855,00:18:28.107,I'm the doctor.
00:18:28.148,00:18:29.525,Where are you taking him?
00:18:29.567,00:18:31.694,All cardiac vital signs are within normal range.
00:18:31.736,00:18:32.779,Do you have any I.D.?
00:18:32.820,00:18:34.781,No. His -- His heart.
00:18:34.822,00:18:36.783,His heart is fine.
00:18:36.824,00:18:38.492,Adam needs an echocardiogram.
00:18:38.534,00:18:41.704,No. Behave yourself. Or you'll be removed from the building.
00:18:53.549,00:18:55.259,Echo. Echo.
00:19:03.350,00:19:04.811,Melendez: What's that?
00:19:04.852,00:19:06.104,Claire: A one-way valve.
00:19:06.145,00:19:10.483,And he reports the boy suffered a pneumothorax.
00:19:10.524,00:19:12.819,That is cool.
00:19:19.158,00:19:21.619,Do you think we should do an echocardiogram?
00:19:21.661,00:19:28.876,"Based on the presenting symptoms, which give no indication that an echocardiogram is necessary, I'm going to answer no."
00:19:28.918,00:19:30.252,Am I missing something?
00:19:30.294,00:19:32.338,"No, sir."
00:19:32.379,00:19:33.631,Knife.
00:20:22.722,00:20:28.394,"Glassman : We don't normally treat rabbits, especially -- This was the closest doctor place, and it was an emergency."
00:20:28.435,00:20:29.645,"No, I can see that."
00:20:29.687,00:20:34.775,"But even if I was a vet, the rabbit...is dead."
00:20:37.070,00:20:40.073,"I'm sorry, guys."
00:20:40.114,00:20:44.493,Everything smells different when it rains.
00:20:44.535,00:20:47.454,What do we do now?
00:20:47.496,00:20:51.417,"Well, you should bury him, I guess."
00:20:51.458,00:20:54.336,"I don't know, give him a -- a nice funeral."
00:20:54.378,00:20:57.256,Has he gone to heaven?
00:21:00.968,00:21:03.512,"Yeah, sure. Uh, sure -- sure, he has. Um..."
00:21:03.554,00:21:06.807,"No, I don't want him to go to heaven! I want him to be here!"
00:21:10.269,00:21:11.478,This won't happen again.
00:21:11.520,00:21:13.856,It can't happen again.
00:21:13.898,00:21:15.399,I know that.
00:21:15.441,00:21:18.986,"I mean, nothing like this is ever going to happen to us, ever again."
00:21:19.028,00:21:21.822,Because we're not going home.
00:21:21.864,00:21:24.366,We're never going home again.
00:21:24.408,00:21:26.660,"We have each other, and that's all we need."
00:21:36.295,00:21:44.095,"Andrews: A surgeon needs to communicate -- not just information, but sympathy, empathy."
00:21:44.137,00:21:46.222,Can Dr. Murphy do that?
00:21:46.264,00:21:50.309,He can't even reliably show up for a job interview.
00:21:50.350,00:22:01.528,Are you gonna sit here and tell us that there were no other equally-qualified young surgeons -- surgeons without this one's...issues?
00:22:01.570,00:22:02.947,No.
00:22:02.989,00:22:06.659,Which is why -- exactly why -- we should hire Shaun.
00:22:06.700,00:22:11.497,We should hire him because he is qualified and because he is different.
00:22:11.538,00:22:15.168,How long ago was it that we wouldn't hire black doctors in this hospital?
00:22:15.209,00:22:20.047,How m-- How long ago was it that we wouldn't hire female doctors at this hospital?
00:22:20.089,00:22:25.427,"So, you're comparing being African-American or a woman with being autistic."
00:22:25.469,00:22:27.471,"Please, go on..."
00:22:31.558,00:22:34.645,The rationalization is exactly the same.
00:22:34.687,00:22:38.356,"Words like temperament and, Oh, no! Ohh!"
00:22:38.398,00:22:40.400,How are the patients going to react?
00:22:40.442,00:22:42.569,Aren't we judged by how we treat people?
00:22:42.611,00:22:45.990,I don't mean as doctors.
00:22:46.032,00:22:49.743,Especially those who -- who don't have the same advantages that we have.
00:22:49.785,00:23:00.046,"We hire Shaun, and we give hope to those people with limitations that those limitations are not what they think they are, that they do have a shot!"
00:23:04.466,00:23:09.347,"We hire Shaun, and we make this hospital better for it."
00:23:09.387,00:23:13.684,"We hire Shaun, and we are better people for it."
00:23:13.726,00:23:22.193,"We'd be better people, spending a lot more on malpractice insurance."
00:23:22.235,00:23:25.112,-How old is this kid again?
00:23:25.154,00:23:27.489,Spong stick.
00:23:33.329,00:23:35.248,What was his heart rate five minutes ago?
00:23:35.289,00:23:36.540,"Uh, 86."
00:23:36.582,00:23:37.750,You sure?
00:23:37.791,00:23:40.586,Certain. He's been a rock.
00:23:40.627,00:23:44.090,"No, something's changed."
00:23:47.927,00:23:49.345,You asked earlier about an echo.
00:23:49.387,00:23:52.306,"You had no medical reason, but you asked anyway. Why?"
00:23:52.348,00:23:58.396,"There was this weird guy, the one that did the one-way valve, he kept insisting that the boy needed an echocardiogram."
00:23:58.436,00:23:59.646,He didn't say why?
00:23:59.688,00:24:01.857,H-He was really weird.
00:24:03.441,00:24:05.694,His blood pressure's dropping.
00:24:05.736,00:24:09.240,He's not bleeding anymore.
00:24:09.282,00:24:10.657,Do an echo.
00:24:10.699,00:24:12.701,"Sir, the boy is wide open."
00:24:12.743,00:24:15.746,Good. That'll give me time to figure out why the hell we're doing an echo.
00:24:15.788,00:24:16.830,"Dr. Browne, you're with me."
00:24:16.872,00:24:18.082,We're gonna go find your weird guy.
00:24:18.124,00:24:20.876,Keep him stable.
00:24:22.962,00:24:25.089,Why the echo?
00:24:25.131,00:24:29.302,"Uh, okay."
00:24:29.343,00:24:36.642,"Uh, he -- Uh, I, uh -- He -- Okay. I understand you think he needs an echocardiogram."
00:24:36.683,00:24:39.103,We just don't know why.
00:24:39.145,00:24:43.983,"Well, I-I noticed that there was a slight reduction in the intensity of the electrocardiogram."
00:24:44.024,00:24:46.026,"The electrical flow -- I noticed that, too."
00:24:46.068,00:24:48.862,"The heart rate was the same, but the amplitude dropped."
00:24:48.904,00:24:50.281,Pericardial effusion.
00:24:50.323,00:24:51.698,Reduced cardiac output.
00:24:51.740,00:24:53.242,Would stress other organs.
00:24:53.284,00:24:54.576,Causing them to shut down.
00:24:54.618,00:24:56.162,Yes.
00:24:58.080,00:24:59.497,Hold on.
00:24:59.539,00:25:03.961,"Yeah, we're coming right back up -- Thank you."
00:25:04.003,00:25:06.213,They did the echo.
00:25:06.255,00:25:07.714,No pericardial effusion.
00:25:07.756,00:25:10.384,No. It has to be. There -- There is no other explanation.
00:25:10.426,00:25:14.138,"The echo is normal, which means we just wasted our time."
00:25:14.180,00:25:16.849,N-No.
00:25:26.524,00:25:29.403,"Okay, um, hey, come with me."
00:25:29.445,00:25:32.823,Come on.
00:25:45.585,00:25:47.838,Show them.
00:25:56.138,00:25:57.890,Again.
00:26:02.061,00:26:04.604,Again.
00:26:04.646,00:26:07.107,Again.
00:26:07.149,00:26:08.401,There.
00:26:08.442,00:26:10.361,Looks normal to me.
00:26:10.403,00:26:11.904,It's not normal.
00:26:11.945,00:26:14.365,There's a concave deformity in the right atrium.
00:26:14.407,00:26:16.158,"Um, no, there's not."
00:26:16.200,00:26:18.536,"Yeah. Yes, there is."
00:26:18.576,00:26:22.664,"Even if you are right, that's not where a pericardial effusion manifests."
00:26:25.084,00:26:27.836,Not usually.
00:26:27.878,00:26:31.382,But it -- it could.
00:26:31.424,00:26:35.302,This kid was sprayed with glass shards -- cut his jugular.
00:26:35.344,00:26:38.347,What if a piece of glass entered his blood stream?
00:26:38.389,00:26:44.437,"It could have traveled down the jugular vein, into the brachiocephalic vein and on to the superior vena cava."
00:26:44.478,00:26:52.445,"If it punctured the SVC, blood could be leaking behind the heart, restricting the heart's ability to expand and fill during diastole, reducing the heart's efficiency."
00:26:52.486,00:26:55.613,Lot of ifs there.
00:27:00.077,00:27:04.373,"Dr. Chen, pair of 14-gauge on a syringe."
00:27:08.419,00:27:14.007,All in favor of ratifying Dr. Glassman's decision in hiring Dr. Shaun Murphy?
00:27:18.178,00:27:20.514,All against.
00:27:23.392,00:27:24.477,Excuse me.
00:27:24.518,00:27:25.811,Is this a medical emergency?
00:27:25.852,00:27:30.524,"No. No medical emergency -- Then you weren't supposed to interrupt -- Yes, I know, but you need to go online."
00:27:30.566,00:27:32.359,-What? What site?
00:27:30.566,00:27:35.362,"-Pretty much any of them -- Twitter, YouTube, any local news site."
00:27:40.451,00:27:42.202,He saved his life!
00:27:46.248,00:27:48.875,"The YouTube clip already has over 200,000 views."
00:27:48.917,00:27:52.421,"Apparently, he's one of our doctors."
00:27:52.463,00:27:56.175,Dr. Shaun Murphy saved this boy?
00:27:56.216,00:27:58.636,The boy is in O.R. 2.
00:27:58.676,00:28:02.264,Dr. Melendez isn't sure if he's going to make it.
00:28:11.524,00:28:16.236,Your fiancé sure can handle a knife.
00:28:16.278,00:28:18.864,Why did you warn me about respecting Dr. Andrews?
00:28:23.035,00:28:24.328,What's going on?
00:28:24.370,00:28:27.039,I'm not gonna always be here to protect you.
00:28:27.080,00:28:30.334,You think you're gonna lose?
00:28:30.376,00:28:32.586,Everybody loses...
00:28:32.628,00:28:34.754,eventually.
00:28:37.216,00:28:39.510,Is that your guy?
00:28:55.442,00:28:57.403,Can we get a TV?
00:28:57.444,00:28:58.696,No.
00:28:58.737,00:29:01.240,Why not?
00:29:01.281,00:29:03.200,"Because we're poor, dude."
00:29:03.242,00:29:06.203,We live in a bus.
00:29:06.245,00:29:09.415,Do you think Mom is looking for us?
00:29:09.456,00:29:11.542,Nope.
00:29:14.628,00:29:20.509,"She loves us, but she knows it's better this way."
00:29:30.352,00:29:32.229,I got you a present.
00:29:32.271,00:29:34.022,It's not my birthday.
00:29:34.064,00:29:37.484,I got you a present anyway.
00:29:53.500,00:29:55.419,Here.
00:30:37.795,00:30:40.213,Kelly.
00:30:55.688,00:31:01.067,Dr. Browne...
00:31:01.109,00:31:04.321,You were right.
00:31:22.798,00:31:24.758,I don't like pickles.
00:31:24.800,00:31:27.678,I don't want pickles.
00:31:29.805,00:31:32.516,You saved that boy's life.
00:31:32.558,00:31:33.851,"Oh, good."
00:31:33.892,00:31:35.853,His name is Adam.
00:31:35.894,00:31:38.522,Traumatic pneumothorax.
00:31:38.564,00:31:40.940,I'm hungry.
00:31:43.902,00:31:47.072,Board reconvenes in 45 minutes.
00:31:50.576,00:31:54.454,Can you stay here until I get back?
00:31:54.496,00:31:58.208,Okay.
00:31:58.250,00:31:59.418,Okay.
00:32:07.092,00:32:09.052,He's got a serious deficit.
00:32:09.094,00:32:11.179,A child is alive today because of that deficit.
00:32:11.221,00:32:13.181,"And tomorrow, one may be dead because of it."
00:32:13.223,00:32:19.396,"I seem to remember that when I hired you, you weren't exactly making the most adult decisions."
00:32:19.438,00:32:21.732,You haven't killed anyone yet. Have you?
00:32:21.774,00:32:26.445,"Well, thankfully, there's a cure for youth and stupidity -- time and experience."
00:32:26.486,00:32:28.530,a cure for stupidity?
00:32:28.572,00:32:29.907,Okay.
00:32:29.948,00:32:31.909,That would be a windfall.
00:32:31.950,00:32:35.788,All Shaun has is a diagnosis.
00:32:35.829,00:32:37.915,I'd like your help.
00:32:37.956,00:32:41.710,I take it I'm not gonna get it.
00:32:41.752,00:32:43.879,Okay.
00:32:44.797,00:32:46.715,Wait.
00:32:46.757,00:32:48.467,What's the story with this kid?
00:32:48.508,00:32:50.719,Why is it so important to you?
00:32:52.429,00:32:53.806,Why not?
00:32:53.847,00:32:59.895,Because letting things get personal is a sure formula for screwing things up.
00:32:59.937,00:33:01.104,I don't know.
00:33:01.146,00:33:04.274,Letting things get personal is how we...
00:33:04.316,00:33:07.444,make it matter.
00:33:15.619,00:33:19.289,"So, are you proud or disappointed?"
00:33:19.331,00:33:21.750,Do I have to pick just one?
00:33:28.674,00:33:32.636,Hey.
00:33:32.678,00:33:34.596,"You're new to town, right?"
00:33:34.638,00:33:36.181,Yes.
00:33:36.222,00:33:38.350,"Well, I'm sure you have a lot of questions."
00:33:38.391,00:33:40.352,No.
00:33:40.393,00:33:42.688,Uh...
00:33:42.729,00:33:46.191,"You got to be curious about the place, about the people."
00:33:46.232,00:33:51.864,"Dr. Glassman gave me a map of the hospital, and I got a map of San Jose online."
00:33:56.535,00:33:59.245,Great.
00:34:02.791,00:34:04.626,I do have one question.
00:34:04.668,00:34:08.005,Yeah?
00:34:08.046,00:34:15.053,"Why were you rude to me when we first met, then nicer to me the second time we met, and now you want to be my friend?"
00:34:15.094,00:34:18.598,Which time was it that you were pretending?
00:34:21.351,00:34:24.980,Shaun. We're ready.
00:34:31.570,00:34:34.614,The vote was clear.
00:34:34.656,00:34:36.491,Is it really because of a piece of publicity?
00:34:36.533,00:34:38.660,It's because the man just saved somebody's life.
00:34:38.702,00:34:41.454,"And thank God for that, but it doesn't change a single thing we discussed."
00:34:41.496,00:34:42.831,Glassman: Give him six months.
00:34:42.873,00:34:48.837,If he proves anything less than excellent -- Someone less than excellent means someone else dies.
00:34:48.879,00:34:51.882,"Well, I-I would love to make you happy, Doctor."
00:34:51.924,00:34:54.843,"I would love to hire someone who never, ever makes a mistake."
00:34:54.885,00:34:57.763,"Unfortunately, God already has a job."
00:34:57.804,00:35:02.225,I can accept that he will have insights that none of the rest of us will have.
00:35:02.267,00:35:05.103,Can you accept that he will make mistakes none of the rest of us will make?
00:35:05.144,00:35:08.147,You won't be the one who pays the price.
00:35:12.819,00:35:19.701,"If Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do, he will be immediately released."
00:35:19.743,00:35:24.289,And I will resign my position as President of this hospital.
00:35:26.708,00:35:29.294,We haven't heard from Dr. Murphy yet.
00:35:29.335,00:35:34.716,Perhaps we should hear from him before we decide his fate.
00:35:34.758,00:35:37.761,Shaun...
00:35:52.400,00:35:55.236,Dr. Murphy...
00:35:55.278,00:35:59.198,I'd like you to tell us why you want to become a surgeon.
00:36:17.383,00:36:19.469,Why do I want them to be my friends?
00:36:19.511,00:36:21.429,"Everybody needs friends, Shaun."
00:36:21.471,00:36:24.933,"It's gonna be cool, okay?"
00:36:24.975,00:36:27.310,Okay.
00:36:32.858,00:36:35.276,"Hey, stop following me."
00:37:07.934,00:37:09.061,"Told ya it was fun, right?"
00:37:09.102,00:37:10.729,Shh!
00:37:16.776,00:37:18.444,"Hey, you know what?"
00:37:55.648,00:38:08.828,"The day that the rain smelled like ice cream, my bunny went to heaven in front of my eyes."
00:38:08.870,00:38:19.297,"The day that the copper pipes in the old building smelled like burnt food, my brother..."
00:38:19.338,00:38:23.009,went to heaven in front of my eyes.
00:38:26.012,00:38:28.848,I couldn't save them.
00:38:28.890,00:38:33.019,It's sad.
00:38:33.061,00:38:37.941,Neither one had the chance to become an adult.
00:38:37.983,00:38:43.738,They should have become adults.
00:38:43.780,00:38:51.037,They should have had children of their own and loved those children.
00:38:55.041,00:39:00.922,And I want to make that possible for other people.
00:39:10.265,00:39:16.729,And I want to make a lot of money so that I can have a television.
00:39:25.613,00:39:30.869,Dr. Murphy...
00:39:30.910,00:39:37.334,I want to be the first to welcome you to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
00:39:40.212,00:39:42.421,We're very proud to have you.
00:39:52.349,00:39:57.770,"Shaun, Dr. Melendez's team is going into surgery."
00:39:57.812,00:40:00.606,"I mean, if you're interested."
00:41:02.085,00:41:05.171,Got a messy field here.
00:41:05.213,00:41:07.465,Murphy.
00:41:14.973,00:41:17.600,Shaun: Suction.
00:41:23.231,00:41:26.109,"Never forget, you're the smart one."
00:41:26.151,00:41:28.278,You can do anything.
00:41:28.320,00:41:31.530,"And I'm proud of you, Shaun."
00:41:37.495,00:41:39.497,Bet you've seen many of these.
00:41:42.208,00:41:44.669,I remember my first.
00:41:44.710,00:41:49.007,"Kept thinking, It doesn't get any better than this."
00:41:49.048,00:41:52.510,"And for you, I'm afraid, that's literally true."
00:41:54.804,00:42:01.644,"You're a nice kid, and you're obviously very smart, but you don't belong here."
00:42:01.686,00:42:07.942,"So, as long as you're part of my team, this is all you're ever going to be doing -- suction."
00:42:11.696,00:42:16.284,I saw a lot of surgeons in medical school.
00:42:16.326,00:42:18.286,You're much better than them.
00:42:18.328,00:42:20.746,I have a lot to learn from you.
00:42:27.128,00:42:30.340,You're very arrogant.
00:42:30.382,00:42:34.386,Do you think that helps you be a good surgeon?
00:42:34.427,00:42:38.306,Does it hurt you as a person?
00:42:38.348,00:42:40.933,Is it worth it?
00:00:04.838,00:00:08.091,characterized by difficulty in communicating.
00:00:08.174,00:00:10.343,Does it sound like I'm describing a surgeon?
00:00:10.802,00:00:11.720,You saved his life.
00:00:11.803,00:00:13.304,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
00:00:13.388,00:00:16.266,"Never forget, you're the smart one. And I'm proud of you, Shaun."
00:00:16.349,00:00:24.899,My brother went to heaven… He's got a serious deficit.
00:00:24.983,00:00:31.781,"We hire Shaun, and we give hope to those people with limitations that those limitations are not what they think they are."
00:00:31.865,00:00:33.700,That they do have a shot.
00:00:38.121,00:00:41.541,I will resign my position as president of this hospital.
00:02:01.412,00:02:02.413,Where to?
00:02:02.622,00:02:04.582,San Jose Saint Bonaventure Hospital.
00:02:05.041,00:02:07.794,I'm a surgical resident. Today's my first full day.
00:02:08.336,00:02:09.546,I meant floor.
00:02:10.088,00:02:11.381,Oh. Ground floor.
00:02:13.383,00:02:14.759,I'm taking the bus.
00:02:29.023,00:02:32.402,"55 years old, post-op day one from a radical prostatectomy."
00:02:32.485,00:02:34.237,"Morning, Mitchell. I'm Dr. Melendez."
00:02:34.320,00:02:36.656,"These are my residents, Dr. Browne and Dr. Kalu."
00:02:37.031,00:02:38.575,Your surgery went perfectly.
00:02:38.658,00:02:40.493,Yeah? Am I ever gonna walk again?
00:02:41.661,00:02:42.829,"Yes, of course."
00:02:43.663,00:02:45.790,"This is Mitchell Brand, I reviewed his chart."
00:02:45.874,00:02:49.252,"He's 55 years old, from Chicago, divorced with two children."
00:02:49.335,00:02:51.796,You did a radical prostatectomy on him yesterday.
00:02:51.880,00:02:55.091,There are many possible complications but none related to motor neurons.
00:02:55.174,00:02:56.968,There is no chance you won't be able to walk.
00:03:00.597,00:03:02.473,He… He wasn't worried about his legs.
00:03:05.101,00:03:06.519,"Oh, yes."
00:03:06.603,00:03:09.022,There's a significant chance of impotence.
00:03:10.231,00:03:11.649,"Dr. Murphy, you're late."
00:03:11.941,00:03:13.443,"Nah, the bus was late."
00:03:13.693,00:03:15.778,The schedule was clear. They post it online.
00:03:15.862,00:03:21.993,"But the 4 bus was late, which meant… -You're late. -Five minutes. We've all been… On your first day, no less. It is your responsibility to be here."
00:03:22.076,00:03:27.165,"If you are not, you have failed in your responsibility, -which makes it your fault. -Okay. How can it be my fault?"
00:03:27.248,00:03:29.918,I did nothing wrong. The bus… This is gonna work out great.
00:03:30.001,00:03:31.794,The board clearly made the right choice in hiring you.
00:03:32.670,00:03:33.671,Thank you.
00:03:34.631,00:03:37.258,"Dr. Melendez, we've got an emergent consult in the ER."
00:03:38.843,00:03:41.137,You should be fine if you leave it alone for a couple of days.
00:03:42.639,00:03:45.767,"Four days of indigestion, bloating, constipation, and nausea."
00:03:49.312,00:03:50.396,Did you give her morphine?
00:03:50.480,00:03:52.690,"Yeah, 10 milligrams. It hasn't touched her pain."
00:03:54.192,00:03:55.276,You have time to get a CT?
00:03:55.860,00:03:57.153,Yeah. That's why I called you.
00:04:02.825,00:04:03.910,It's very big.
00:04:05.328,00:04:06.162,"Yes, it is."
00:04:06.871,00:04:07.997,What are we looking at?
00:04:11.292,00:04:12.877,Renal angiomyolipoma?
00:04:19.634,00:04:22.262,"She has a sarcoma, a malignant tumor."
00:04:23.513,00:04:24.514,Malignant?
00:04:24.597,00:04:25.890,"That means it's killing me, right?"
00:04:25.974,00:04:27.350,-Yes. -Not necessarily.
00:04:27.433,00:04:28.726,We're just speculating right now.
00:04:29.018,00:04:34.190,"No, it's definitely malignant. If it weren't malignant… -Please stop saying malignant. -Shall we talk outside?"
00:04:37.902,00:04:40.029,Give her more morphine. As much as she wants.
00:04:40.113,00:04:41.030,Okay.
00:04:42.156,00:04:43.157,Hang in there.
00:04:46.494,00:04:48.329,-You didn't need to be so blunt. -Why?
00:04:49.872,00:04:53.126,Her prognosis is terminal without immediate medical intervention.
00:04:53.209,00:04:54.127,Isn't that scary?
00:04:56.004,00:04:58.798,"Well, that fear does her no good."
00:05:00.133,00:05:02.593,Does she have a malignant sarcoma?
00:05:03.386,00:05:05.054,Are we gonna be doing a laparotomy?
00:05:06.597,00:05:13.271,"We'd need intra-operative staging with a biopsy, extensive dissection of the retroperitoneum, and excision of the mass with wide, clear margins."
00:05:17.150,00:05:19.068,About cutting open a 40-year-old woman.
00:05:19.152,00:05:20.570,Real person. Right behind that door.
00:05:20.653,00:05:21.696,It's called bedside manner.
00:05:21.779,00:05:23.156,No such thing as outside-the-door manner.
00:05:25.283,00:05:27.160,We'd be saving a life. And we'd be learning.
00:05:27.827,00:05:30.538,"-See? -Dr. Browne, you're my number two."
00:05:32.123,00:05:36.210,"With all due respect, Doctor… Comments that start that way rarely come across that way."
00:05:36.294,00:05:37.754,I was going to say that's an excellent call.
00:05:37.837,00:05:40.214,"Thank you. Jared, prep the surgical team."
00:05:40.298,00:05:41.424,"Sir, what do I do?"
00:05:44.802,00:05:47.221,-Scut work. -What's scut work?
00:05:47.305,00:05:49.557,Today I'm gonna need my surgeons to have no distractions.
00:05:50.058,00:05:52.518,So I'm gonna need you to handle those distractions.
00:05:52.602,00:05:57.148,All the work they do every day that they hate doing… You're handling it for them.
00:06:07.116,00:06:09.118,Make sure they know we still need a consent on that one.
00:06:15.291,00:06:17.710,-Am I being punished for something? -No.
00:06:19.295,00:06:20.338,Okay.
00:06:22.090,00:06:23.299,So that's it?
00:06:23.382,00:06:25.218,You just accept my answer at face value?
00:06:25.968,00:06:26.803,Why?
00:06:27.845,00:06:29.097,You're very arrogant.
00:06:30.223,00:06:32.183,Arrogant people don't think they need to lie.
00:06:33.184,00:06:34.977,"So, you must be doing this to teach me."
00:06:35.061,00:06:37.271,I look forward to learning from scut work.
00:06:42.318,00:06:43.402,"Say, Ah."
00:06:43.861,00:06:45.113,Ah.
00:06:45.196,00:06:47.615,-How long will this be? -Seven minutes.
00:06:49.242,00:06:53.454,"Without any complications, it takes seven minutes to do a discharge examination properly."
00:06:53.538,00:06:56.624,Dr. Dunsmuir has already cleared him to go and we need the bed.
00:06:56.707,00:07:00.545,Okay. Protocol requires that the surgical department also clears him.
00:07:03.881,00:07:05.091,You have an ear infection.
00:07:06.592,00:07:09.637,My hearing's been a little muffled and I've had some ringing.
00:07:09.720,00:07:12.598,"They gave him amoxicillin, and we're sending him home."
00:07:12.682,00:07:15.726,Which is why you're here. To send him home.
00:07:16.269,00:07:19.439,I'd like an MRI of the head and internal auditory meatus.
00:07:19.522,00:07:21.983,I'm not being discharged? What do you think is wrong?
00:07:24.652,00:07:26.446,I'll tell you when I know for sure.
00:07:27.238,00:07:28.364,I don't wanna scare you.
00:07:40.460,00:07:42.795,Shaun. What are you doing down here?
00:07:43.629,00:07:45.131,I'm waiting for her to fart.
00:07:47.800,00:07:52.138,Flatulence. But I'm using the word fart in front of the patient to be more casual.
00:07:52.221,00:07:54.891,"But you're the president of the hospital, so I'll say flatulence to you."
00:07:55.975,00:07:57.351,"Well, I appreciate that."
00:07:57.727,00:07:59.228,Why are you doing that?
00:07:59.312,00:08:04.942,"She had her deviated septum repaired. Before we can release her, we have to be sure she isn't suffering from postoperative ileus."
00:08:05.860,00:08:06.861,Ah.
00:08:08.279,00:08:12.825,This is what Dr. Melendez feels you'll be most useful doing today?
00:08:12.909,00:08:14.619,Waiting for farts?
00:08:14.702,00:08:16.454,I'm not just waiting for farts.
00:08:16.537,00:08:18.789,-Thank goodness. -I'm doing all the scut work.
00:08:21.918,00:08:25.338,"Well, welcome to your surgical residency."
00:08:27.715,00:08:28.674,Thank you.
00:08:31.427,00:08:33.429,There. I think that was it.
00:08:38.142,00:08:39.352,I don't think so.
00:08:40.686,00:08:43.105,I'll wait a little longer. This is important.
00:08:46.526,00:08:49.779,The procedure is called a laparotomy.
00:08:50.279,00:08:51.364,Hmm.
00:08:53.449,00:08:54.951,"Yeah, your heart sounds good."
00:08:55.868,00:09:00.373,"So, we make a long incision down the middle of your abdomen… -Expose the tumor… -Am I going to die?"
00:09:03.042,00:09:07.797,Dr. Melendez is the best surgeon I have ever seen… Can this all wait?
00:09:08.839,00:09:14.095,You have a very serious condition. It's not advisable to… Just a couple of weeks. My son is getting married next weekend.
00:09:15.555,00:09:16.973,They look very happy.
00:09:17.557,00:09:28.234,"After the initial incision… They've been planning this for months. If they have to reschedule… Well, this is complicated surgery, but if all goes well, recovery's pretty easy."
00:09:28.609,00:09:30.444,No need to reschedule anything.
00:09:31.988,00:09:34.824,And if it doesn't? If it doesn't go well?
00:09:39.287,00:09:42.707,My husband died in a car accident a couple of years ago.
00:09:44.458,00:09:46.294,Mark is our only child.
00:09:48.129,00:09:51.215,I can't die right before his wedding. I can't.
00:09:53.968,00:09:55.469,You're not gonna die.
00:09:56.178,00:09:59.056,You will be at the wedding. Looking beautiful.
00:10:00.933,00:10:02.018,Okay.
00:10:09.191,00:10:11.861,"You're not supposed to make promises like that, Dr. Browne."
00:10:11.944,00:10:13.446,I told her what she needed to hear.
00:10:13.529,00:10:17.074,"Officially, our legal department's policy is to tell the ugly truth."
00:10:17.158,00:10:19.410,The uglier the better. Is that what you did?
00:10:19.493,00:10:20.536,I don't think that's what you did.
00:10:20.620,00:10:21.621,"Yeah, well, it's a dumb policy."
00:10:21.704,00:10:24.540,She needs to have the surgery. Scaring her would change nothing.
00:10:24.624,00:10:28.544,Right. Because a much better policy would be to lie to all of our patients whenever it makes you feel better.
00:10:28.628,00:10:31.464,"No, it doesn't make me feel better. It makes her feel better."
00:10:35.009,00:10:35.926,I'm pathetic.
00:10:38.179,00:10:40.014,-What? -I am pathetic.
00:10:40.723,00:10:45.394,"And here's my thinking, so just bear with me because it kind of insults both of us."
00:10:46.437,00:10:48.981,You met that woman an hour ago and you lied to her.
00:10:49.065,00:10:52.109,A pity lie because you obviously care about her.
00:10:52.193,00:10:55.446,A pity lie that has absolutely zero upside for you.
00:10:55.529,00:10:58.699,"But I can't make you, the world's softest touch, care about me."
00:11:10.127,00:11:11.045,Hey.
00:11:16.926,00:11:18.761,I need a consult.
00:11:20.137,00:11:21.555,You have a question about this?
00:11:22.348,00:11:23.682,This patient's perfectly healthy.
00:11:23.766,00:11:25.309,There's not even any artifact on these images.
00:11:25.393,00:11:28.354,"Yeah. Which, in turn, raises an interesting medical question."
00:11:28.437,00:11:30.564,Why the hell did this patient get an MRI?
00:11:32.024,00:11:33.275,I don't know anything about this.
00:11:33.359,00:11:37.696,"Yeah. Someone on your team ordered it. It's your responsibility, which makes it your fault."
00:11:38.989,00:11:41.992,"How did you… It's my department, it's my job to know everything."
00:11:43.244,00:11:46.247,"Well, then, since I work for you, doesn't that make all this actually your fault?"
00:11:46.539,00:11:48.541,Sorry. I stopped listening after I work for you.
00:11:57.466,00:11:59.385,-Does that hurt? -Yes.
00:12:02.847,00:12:04.849,"She has a tummy ache. That's what they do, they ache."
00:12:05.141,00:12:07.101,She's just trying to get out of school. Again.
00:12:07.184,00:12:08.602,Where do you think she learned that from?
00:12:08.686,00:12:11.856,You don't think she hears you calling in sick to work right before you go golfing?
00:12:11.939,00:12:13.065,I like school.
00:12:13.941,00:12:16.152,"Me, too. What did you eat for dinner last night?"
00:12:19.071,00:12:21.073,I did. And it got cold while we were waiting for you.
00:12:21.574,00:12:25.244,"I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase… What tests are you ordering?"
00:12:26.078,00:12:27.746,"D-dimer, lactate, and amylase."
00:12:28.122,00:12:30.332,"-For a tummy ache, hmm? -Yes."
00:12:31.000,00:12:37.465,I'm concerned it may be… Shall we talk outside?
00:12:38.966,00:12:40.593,You're happy she might be sick?
00:12:40.676,00:12:41.552,I'm happy you're wrong.
00:12:41.635,00:12:43.304,"Yeah, let's talk outside."
00:12:46.640,00:12:48.726,Have they been bickering like that the whole time?
00:12:48.809,00:12:50.811,I didn't notice. They aren't sick.
00:12:51.437,00:12:53.105,"Yeah, they're what we call a vector."
00:12:53.981,00:12:55.566,A carrier. A cause of disease.
00:12:56.108,00:12:57.610,-You mean the parents? -Yeah.
00:12:58.068,00:13:01.530,That little girl has a tummy ache because Mommy and Daddy won't stop fighting.
00:13:01.614,00:13:03.157,This isn't a medical issue. Send them home.
00:13:03.240,00:13:06.327,"It could be intestinal malrotation, which could quickly become fatal."
00:13:06.410,00:13:11.916,"And every patient in this hospital could have malaria, but that doesn't mean we're gonna go around testing for every condition we think they could have."
00:13:11.999,00:13:15.503,"For example, that MRI you ordered on the guy with the ear infection?"
00:13:15.586,00:13:19.215,"-Nice call, genius. -Thank you.` I was being sarcastic."
00:13:19.298,00:13:21.634,"It's normal. He's healthy. Send him home, too."
00:13:23.969,00:13:26.055,-Why are you smiling? -Because you're right.
00:13:27.014,00:13:29.058,"So, you thought he was making a mistake and didn't say anything?"
00:13:29.600,00:13:33.437,"You just stood by watching, taking notes, while he wasted everybody's time?"
00:13:33.521,00:13:34.647,Is that your job?
00:13:35.397,00:13:37.816,"In my experience, doctors don't listen to nurses."
00:13:37.900,00:13:41.237,And they only talk to us to lecture us when they figure we screwed something up.
00:13:46.325,00:13:48.744,"From now on, you don't run any tests you don't have to run."
00:13:48.827,00:13:51.288,How do I know if a test is needed until after I run it?
00:13:53.165,00:13:55.793,"She'll tell you. Today, she's your boss."
00:14:12.768,00:14:14.728,I could never eat before surgery.
00:14:15.271,00:14:17.022,Puke? I could do that.
00:14:18.566,00:14:19.942,I get cranky if I don't eat.
00:14:21.944,00:14:23.487,I hear Shaun made the call.
00:14:23.863,00:14:25.364,He's an excellent diagnostician.
00:14:25.990,00:14:27.491,You should get him a job in radiology.
00:14:27.575,00:14:30.786,"He doesn't wanna be a radiologist, he wants to be a surgeon."
00:14:30.870,00:14:32.705,That's what we hired him to be.
00:14:32.788,00:14:35.875,That's what I worked damn hard to hire him to be.
00:14:35.958,00:14:37.501,Not a glorified orderly.
00:14:38.294,00:14:39.670,Every resident does scut work.
00:14:39.753,00:14:41.422,So you're treating him like anybody else?
00:14:41.505,00:14:43.424,"-Are you? -Yes. Yes, I am."
00:14:43.507,00:14:45.801,He more than earned the right to be here.
00:14:45.885,00:14:49.513,He has had to get past people like you and their prejudices every step of the way.
00:14:49.597,00:14:51.849,"-Prejudices? -Yeah, prejudices."
00:14:51.932,00:14:54.768,Do you have any idea how many patients he scared the crap out of today?
00:14:54.852,00:14:56.770,How many wasted tests he ordered?
00:14:57.313,00:14:59.148,-So teach him. -I'm doing that.
00:14:59.648,00:15:01.859,I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.
00:15:04.194,00:15:05.029,Okay.
00:15:05.112,00:15:08.032,"You're gonna make me pull rank, I will pull rank."
00:15:10.492,00:15:11.911,But it's my team.
00:15:12.995,00:15:14.580,You can't tell me how to run my team.
00:15:24.882,00:15:27.635,Hey. How are you doing?
00:15:28.260,00:15:29.595,What's the point of sarcasm?
00:15:31.013,00:15:40.564,"Um… Uh, I… Well, I guess sometimes it's a way of critiquing people in a way that's funny, so they don't feel quite so bad."
00:15:40.648,00:15:42.066,Isn't it just lying?
00:15:43.192,00:15:45.819,"Well, it's not lying, because people know you're lying."
00:15:47.112,00:15:48.322,I'm not good at that.
00:15:52.159,00:15:55.621,We sell chocolate bars every year to pay for our class trip to Mount Rushmore.
00:15:55.996,00:15:56.956,Okay.
00:15:57.039,00:15:58.832,But this year we're not going to Mount Rushmore.
00:15:59.625,00:16:02.711,Because Kenny can't go. He's got cancer.
00:16:03.963,00:16:09.760,"So, Samantha had the idea that if he can't go, none of us would go, and we all thought that was a great idea."
00:16:09.843,00:16:12.262,So we're gonna have a party at the hospital for him.
00:16:14.014,00:16:15.641,There are two Kennys in your class.
00:16:15.724,00:16:17.267,Is it Kenny L or Kenny M?
00:16:17.351,00:16:18.560,No one's sick.
00:16:19.144,00:16:20.187,You mean you lied?
00:16:20.479,00:16:22.106,-You aren't supposed to lie. -Yeah.
00:16:22.189,00:16:25.401,And you and me aren't supposed to starve. We need money for food.
00:16:26.235,00:16:28.654,-Was any of that true? -Yeah.
00:16:29.488,00:16:31.115,We're not going to Mount Rushmore.
00:16:37.329,00:16:39.999,I can't discharge people if I think they might still be sick.
00:16:40.749,00:16:42.835,"Um, of course not. Why would you?"
00:16:42.918,00:16:45.921,Dr. Melendez made Nurse Fryday my boss today.
00:16:46.714,00:16:48.257,Should I speak to Dr. Glassman?
00:16:48.674,00:16:49.758,No.
00:16:50.801,00:16:52.594,What did you think this job was?
00:16:52.970,00:16:55.264,-To save people's lives. -No.
00:16:55.723,00:16:58.976,"I mean, yeah, sometimes we do save lives."
00:16:59.059,00:17:03.355,But the job… It's doing whatever Melendez asks us to do.
00:17:17.578,00:17:22.416,"I'm Dr. Claire Browne. I'm First Assist today, and I'll be leading the time out. Patient's name?"
00:17:25.085,00:17:26.170,Scheduled surgery?
00:17:45.147,00:17:46.231,Let's remove a tumor.
00:17:59.578,00:18:00.871,It might be infected.
00:18:03.248,00:18:05.834,He's 82 years old. Everything is discolored.
00:18:29.566,00:18:31.235,"Yeah, I thought you'd wanna see it."
00:18:32.361,00:18:34.071,It looks like puke.
00:18:34.154,00:18:36.240,"No. No, no. It's not the regular color."
00:18:37.282,00:18:39.409,-Your puke has a regular color? -Yeah.
00:18:39.827,00:18:41.328,It is a bit of an unusual color.
00:18:42.162,00:18:48.877,We could order some… -I'm sending you home. -You're sure?
00:18:49.878,00:18:51.296,It's safe for me to go home?
00:18:55.300,00:18:57.719,You'll learn. By doing.
00:19:06.186,00:19:07.271,Hi.
00:19:10.691,00:19:15.362,My brother said there's a kid named Kenny and he's sick and there might… You should give us money.
00:19:22.494,00:19:23.996,Am I okay?
00:19:24.913,00:19:28.917,"According to all hospital rules and direct instructions given to me, yes."
00:19:34.214,00:19:39.970,But… Whoa.
00:19:46.018,00:19:47.853,"Now, let's get the deep Balfour in here."
00:19:53.066,00:19:54.484,I've got to see where it's safe to cut.
00:19:56.945,00:19:59.781,I can't see anywhere where the tumor hasn't encased her arteries.
00:19:59.865,00:20:01.533,"Claire, tell me you got something."
00:20:07.623,00:20:10.459,I… I can't even see her aorta.
00:20:43.784,00:20:46.203,Didn't we send her home? Four hours ago?
00:20:49.248,00:20:51.500,Dr. Murphy? Dr. Melendez needs you in surgery.
00:21:08.058,00:21:10.394,The tumor has entirely encased the large abdominal arteries.
00:21:10.936,00:21:11.770,That's very bad.
00:21:11.853,00:21:15.440,"If it's in the artery walls, it's going to be impossible to cut out without killing her."
00:21:15.941,00:21:18.694,You should get a biopsy to determine where the margins are.
00:21:19.486,00:21:21.571,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:21:21.655,00:21:23.657,I was being sarcastic. Again.
00:21:25.033,00:21:30.289,"Oh, I see, because you already know everything I said, and you already sent a biopsy to the lab?"
00:21:30.372,00:21:32.165,Yes. 'Cause I'm a doctor too.
00:21:33.125,00:21:34.710,Yes. But you need me?
00:21:34.793,00:21:36.837,Yeah. I need you to run down to the lab and hurry them along.
00:21:54.146,00:21:57.232,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy. I'm a surgical resident.
00:21:57.316,00:21:58.984,Dr. Melendez sent you a biopsy.
00:21:59.067,00:22:00.402,When will the results be ready?
00:22:00.485,00:22:01.903,When I get to it.
00:22:02.321,00:22:03.572,It's very important.
00:22:03.655,00:22:05.073,They're all very important.
00:22:06.908,00:22:08.869,Let me see the other test orders.
00:22:08.952,00:22:12.164,I'll tell you which ones are most important and you can do them in that order.
00:22:12.247,00:22:13.832,I'll be honest and fair.
00:22:14.833,00:22:16.418,That is not the way that it works.
00:22:17.753,00:22:19.171,Now go wait your turn.
00:22:34.352,00:22:36.563,"-Get the hell away from me, you moron. -Let's get out of here."
00:22:39.733,00:22:40.942,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:22:42.778,00:22:46.364,"If you wanna get anything in life, Shaun, there's one thing you gotta do."
00:22:46.448,00:22:47.657,Never be afraid.
00:22:49.326,00:22:50.327,You're the moron!
00:23:08.136,00:23:12.724,"If you don't do Dr. Melendez's test right now, I will throw a rock through your window."
00:23:18.563,00:23:20.190,"Well, I wouldn't want that."
00:23:23.151,00:23:24.361,Go have a seat.
00:23:24.653,00:23:26.655,Your results will be ready in 15 minutes.
00:23:37.833,00:23:38.750,You got a minute?
00:23:38.834,00:23:48.635,"I have a patient lying in the OR waiting for lab results, and I'm sitting here, trying to figure out what the hell I'm gonna do next and I don't like any of my options. So… Yeah, unfortunately, it seems I do."
00:23:49.052,00:23:50.595,Okay. We can talk another time.
00:23:50.679,00:23:51.805,Glassman talked to you.
00:23:54.224,00:23:56.560,I don't have a problem with an autistic doctor.
00:23:56.643,00:23:58.645,"No, you just have a problem with one working for you."
00:23:58.728,00:24:00.147,Really? That's how you see me?
00:24:00.772,00:24:02.023,Let's not make this personal.
00:24:02.107,00:24:03.733,You're accusing me of prejudice.
00:24:04.901,00:24:08.196,I have a problem with a doctor who has a problem with communication.
00:24:08.280,00:24:11.700,Okay. Let's make this personal.
00:24:15.245,00:24:18.123,You and Glassman.
00:24:18.748,00:24:19.958,And who do you not respect?
00:24:23.837,00:24:27.507,It doesn't bother you that it looks like you're on the wrong team?
00:24:29.551,00:24:33.763,"If the tumor hasn't invaded into the arterial walls, we could create a plane of dissection."
00:24:34.306,00:24:38.101,"Well, if it's a non-invasive liposarcoma, we can work it off from the outside."
00:24:38.185,00:24:41.021,"Blunt section, tissue forceps. Peel it off, piece by piece."
00:24:50.906,00:24:52.824,It's a leiomyosarcoma.
00:24:55.785,00:24:57.245,"Well, that sucks."
00:24:59.873,00:25:02.083,"Well, might as well wake her up."
00:25:03.251,00:25:05.378,Let her know she has three months to live.
00:25:05.462,00:25:06.880,Offer palliative care.
00:25:13.845,00:25:15.680,The surgery isn't impossible.
00:25:16.181,00:25:18.683,"Just very, very, very difficult."
00:25:19.309,00:25:21.436,Yes. In the sense that we'll be operating blind.
00:25:21.519,00:25:24.022,"Yes, because the left kidney is in the way."
00:25:24.105,00:25:25.774,The healthy left kidney.
00:25:25.857,00:25:28.485,"Both kidneys are healthy, Jared. She only needs one."
00:25:28.568,00:25:32.197,"Without the left one, it's theoretically possible to access the tumor and remove it."
00:25:32.280,00:25:36.076,You're suggesting we cut out a perfectly healthy organ -just to get a better view? -Yes.
00:25:36.159,00:25:38.203,"-But she might die anyway? -Yes, quite probably."
00:25:40.705,00:25:42.624,I have to go. I have a boil to lance.
00:25:46.586,00:25:51.466,"I mean, that's a brilliant, very, very, very terrible idea."
00:25:54.594,00:25:56.054,Close her up and wake her up.
00:25:56.596,00:25:59.516,Who wants to join me when I tell her she has six weeks left to live?
00:26:02.185,00:26:03.687,There is one possibility.
00:26:07.524,00:26:11.278,"If we remove the left kidney, we might be able to get a good enough view to successfully remove the mass."
00:26:11.736,00:26:15.782,Take out a healthy kidney to get a better view? That's insane.
00:26:17.284,00:26:19.327,A good view is half the battle in any operation.
00:26:20.996,00:26:24.082,Most likely outcome is we'd be depriving her of what little time she has left.
00:26:24.165,00:26:30.088,But if we succeed… You wanna do this 'cause it's exciting. You wanna be a hero.
00:26:30.171,00:26:32.841,"But if you fail, this woman dies."
00:26:32.924,00:26:34.175,She misses her son's wedding.
00:26:35.927,00:26:37.137,"Well, that's the issue, isn't it?"
00:26:38.680,00:26:40.682,You promised this woman she'll be okay.
00:26:49.232,00:26:52.360,She had to do the surgery. I might as well tell her good things.
00:26:56.031,00:26:58.366,"Jared's right, your judgment is compromised."
00:26:58.491,00:27:00.035,-I still think… -But you're not objective.
00:27:00.118,00:27:01.036,Who the hell is?
00:27:02.787,00:27:09.544,"We should at least wake her up, explain what we found, what we're hoping to do, and get a new consent."
00:27:09.627,00:27:12.797,What we're hoping to do is exactly what you told her we were going to do.
00:27:14.090,00:27:17.093,The only thing we'd be explaining is why you undersold the risks.
00:27:18.678,00:27:19.763,We're doing the surgery.
00:27:20.722,00:27:22.724,"And Jared, you're my new number two."
00:27:42.786,00:27:45.330,Going to open the fascia and expose the kidney.
00:27:59.803,00:28:01.054,I would have hired Jeff Van Gundy.
00:28:08.937,00:28:11.356,"Shaun, I believe you've met Trevor."
00:28:11.981,00:28:13.608,"Yes, I sent him home."
00:28:14.067,00:28:16.528,"Yes, well, he didn't go home."
00:28:16.611,00:28:20.615,He actually came to the president of the hospital instead.
00:28:20.698,00:28:22.742,He said you sent him home even though you thought he was sick.
00:28:22.826,00:28:24.452,I specifically never said that.
00:28:24.536,00:28:25.495,I made sure not to say that.
00:28:25.578,00:28:27.497,No. No. What the hell does that mean?
00:28:27.580,00:28:28.498,"What does that mean, Shaun?"
00:28:28.581,00:28:30.041,-Am I healthy? -Probably.
00:28:30.125,00:28:32.377,"You're a doctor, you're supposed to know."
00:28:32.460,00:28:34.421,"No, we're not. Nobody knows anything for sure."
00:28:34.504,00:28:36.756,Anybody could drop dead of a heart attack at any time.
00:28:36.840,00:28:39.759,Who is this guy? Am I… Am I gonna have a heart attack?
00:28:40.844,00:28:47.350,Shaun has some difficulty with certain social interactions… -But if he says… -I don't give a crap what he says.
00:28:47.434,00:28:49.394,What do you say? Am I healthy?
00:28:51.020,00:28:56.651,I've reviewed your chart and I can say with complete confidence that you are in peak physical condition.
00:28:56.735,00:28:57.944,Thank God.
00:29:08.830,00:29:11.916,"Shaun, people need reassurance."
00:29:12.709,00:29:15.712,I told him he was safe to go home. I was very clear.
00:29:15.795,00:29:18.840,With your words. Your actions said something completely different.
00:29:18.923,00:29:21.342,"No, they didn't. My actions were completely silent."
00:29:23.011,00:29:26.347,"When you reassure someone, they have to receive it."
00:29:26.431,00:29:30.435,You have to gauge whether they actually are reassured.
00:29:30.518,00:29:31.603,You understand?
00:29:34.189,00:29:35.607,When did you review Trevor's chart?
00:29:37.358,00:29:38.443,I didn't.
00:29:39.360,00:29:45.200,"It's not really a lie. If you say that he is safe to go home, then I know for a fact that he's safe to go home."
00:29:47.827,00:29:49.412,I sent a girl home today.
00:29:52.123,00:29:55.001,How often do people develop stomach issues because of their brain?
00:29:55.543,00:29:58.963,"Based on my personal experience, every single day."
00:30:02.008,00:30:06.346,"I want D-dimer, lactate, and amylase for a 10-year-old girl, Martine LaDuff."
00:30:06.429,00:30:08.556,She might have a tummy ache caused by stress.
00:30:09.599,00:30:10.517,Or she might not.
00:30:11.434,00:30:13.770,"-Hi, Shaun. -Hi, Carly."
00:30:13.853,00:30:16.064,That's a lot of tests for an upset stomach.
00:30:16.564,00:30:19.192,-You could get in trouble. -That's definitely true.
00:30:29.577,00:30:30.662,Okay.
00:30:36.543,00:30:40.255,"Let's get in there with some suction, Claire, so we can get a better view of what we're dealing with."
00:30:45.718,00:30:46.803,There it is.
00:30:53.351,00:30:54.978,But now it's a mess we can see.
00:30:56.980,00:30:58.898,Everything is within normal range.
00:31:01.568,00:31:03.736,Slightly elevated lactate and amylase.
00:31:03.820,00:31:08.241,And she's very small. Normal should be lower. Normal should be lower.
00:31:11.828,00:31:13.246,What do you think she has?
00:31:16.499,00:31:17.584,Thank you.
00:32:17.310,00:32:19.228,What the hell? It's after 1:00.
00:32:19.312,00:32:22.106,I ran tests. The results were ambiguous.
00:32:22.190,00:32:25.818,I think Martine has intestinal malrotation and that a volvulus has occurred.
00:32:25.902,00:32:28.154,Ambiguous tests told you this?
00:32:28.237,00:32:30.031,It's a genetic condition.
00:32:30.114,00:32:32.033,The symptoms are very similar to stress.
00:32:32.116,00:32:33.284,Call us in the morning.
00:32:33.368,00:32:35.203,Okay. She may not be alive in the morning.
00:32:39.415,00:32:40.500,Does your boss know you're here?
00:32:42.585,00:32:44.963,"No, I think he'd be upset with me for being here."
00:32:46.464,00:32:49.759,I am not waking my daughter up in the middle of a school night because of some freak.
00:32:50.051,00:32:53.680,"And you don't need to call me in the morning, because I'll be calling your boss in the morning."
00:33:02.897,00:33:04.107,Were you being sarcastic?
00:33:04.190,00:33:07.485,"-How hard is it to get rid of someone? -I told him… You're right, I'm weird."
00:33:08.403,00:33:10.321,Part of my weirdness is that I perseverate.
00:33:10.405,00:33:12.532,That means I keep thinking about things.
00:33:12.615,00:33:16.119,So I will keep knocking on your door until I know Martine is okay.
00:33:21.374,00:33:22.583,Martine.
00:33:23.710,00:33:24.919,Martine?
00:33:26.504,00:33:27.714,Martine?
00:33:27.797,00:33:29.465,"Martine, you need to wake up."
00:33:31.467,00:33:33.511,"-Oh, honey… -Martine?"
00:33:34.595,00:33:35.596,She vomited.
00:33:35.680,00:33:37.473,-I can't wake her. -I'll call 911.
00:33:37.890,00:33:39.308,No. There is no time.
00:34:01.664,00:34:04.876,Shaun! What's wrong? What's wrong?
00:34:04.959,00:34:07.128,Hey. Hey! You called me. What's wrong?
00:34:07.211,00:34:08.838,"Hey, look at me. Look at me!"
00:34:08.921,00:34:11.049,"What's… You don't have to say the whole thing, okay?"
00:34:11.132,00:34:12.300,"Just one thing, okay?"
00:34:29.859,00:34:31.944,"Hold on, Shaun. Hold on now. Hold on."
00:34:42.080,00:34:44.290,Her pulse is too weak to perfuse her organs.
00:34:44.373,00:34:52.048,What? What does that… -Jerry… -Please hurry.
00:35:00.932,00:35:02.558,Patient is a 10-year-old female.
00:35:02.642,00:35:05.061,She has bradycardia with hypovolemic shock.
00:35:06.813,00:35:10.358,"She needs oxygen, IV adrenaline and a liter of saline wide open, please."
00:35:13.111,00:35:14.946,Her pulse is better. She needs an ultrasound.
00:35:28.668,00:35:31.170,"No, you definitely did, I just can't quite believe it."
00:36:00.867,00:36:01.868,There.
00:36:02.451,00:36:05.746,The small bowel is twisted around the superior mesenteric artery.
00:36:06.581,00:36:08.416,Martine needs surgery immediately.
00:36:09.167,00:36:11.043,We need to confirm with Dr. Melendez.
00:36:11.127,00:36:13.588,"No, Dr. Melendez is in surgery."
00:36:13.671,00:36:16.048,Part of Martine's bowel is dying and killing her with it.
00:36:16.132,00:36:18.301,No. You cannot make these calls on your own.
00:36:18.384,00:36:19.677,Dr. Melendez was very clear.
00:36:21.596,00:36:22.889,He was very clear.
00:36:22.972,00:36:24.599,"It's past midnight, which means it's tomorrow."
00:36:24.682,00:36:26.309,Which means you're no longer my boss.
00:36:29.145,00:36:30.771,Is this the OR scheduler?
00:36:31.898,00:36:33.733,"Yes, this is Dr. Murphy."
00:36:34.066,00:36:35.902,Prepare an OR for surgery.
00:36:43.326,00:36:44.160,Ten-blade.
00:36:53.753,00:36:55.922,Nice diagnosis. I'll handle the repair work.
00:37:01.219,00:37:03.304,Jared had an excellent idea and she's gonna be fine.
00:37:12.980,00:37:14.398,Go home. Get some sleep.
00:37:19.320,00:37:23.407,I believe our opinions on the wisdom of hiring Dr. Murphy… That battle is lost.
00:37:23.491,00:37:26.911,Shaun is here and we have to accept it and we will treat him like any other resident.
00:37:31.165,00:37:32.375,Dr. Murphy.
00:37:49.392,00:37:52.436,I am gonna get a drink. I am way too wound up to sleep.
00:37:52.728,00:37:53.938,You care to join me?
00:37:54.313,00:37:56.232,-For either? -Don't think so.
00:37:57.233,00:38:00.319,Seriously? We were just part of something amazing.
00:38:00.987,00:38:02.613,We reached into that woman and we healed her.
00:38:02.697,00:38:04.699,"And you're what, cranky?"
00:38:06.409,00:38:08.202,Maybe you could learn something from me.
00:38:08.286,00:38:09.954,Like what? To steal credit?
00:38:10.413,00:38:12.540,Make yourself a hero with Shaun's idea?
00:38:12.623,00:38:15.376,"No, but I fought for it. I went out on a limb for it."
00:38:16.002,00:38:17.086,I deserve credit for that.
00:38:18.629,00:38:20.423,Why didn't you rat me out as soon as I brought it up?
00:38:22.758,00:38:25.177,"No, you didn't rat me out 'cause you thought the idea was crazy."
00:38:26.470,00:38:27.888,You would let me take the fall.
00:38:31.309,00:38:34.520,"My idea if it fails, but Shaun's if it succeeds?"
00:38:36.981,00:38:40.443,"But I'll tell you what, I'll accept that you're right."
00:38:41.319,00:38:42.820,I'll apologize to the whole team.
00:38:43.487,00:38:46.324,If you prove to me that you're not a hypocrite.
00:38:46.407,00:38:48.117,How am I supposed to prove something like that?
00:38:49.285,00:38:51.495,Our patient's about to come out of anesthesia.
00:38:52.079,00:38:53.164,Tell her the truth.
00:38:54.623,00:39:02.006,"When she wakes up and hears what we did, how we miraculously saved her life, be honest with her, about credit."
00:39:02.590,00:39:04.008,Tell her you didn't want to do it.
00:39:04.884,00:39:08.304,Tell her that you wanted to send her home to die.
00:39:16.395,00:39:20.483,I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.
00:39:21.692,00:39:23.110,I heard you tried.
00:39:24.779,00:39:25.988,You're welcome.
00:39:27.573,00:39:32.203,Just a friendly warning. I know you have no interest in helping Shaun.
00:39:32.286,00:39:38.834,"You figure you give him a little authority, he'll screw something up and then you will be done with him, and then you'll be done with me."
00:39:40.044,00:39:45.633,You're right about me. I am getting old and maybe a little emotional.
00:39:46.592,00:39:48.427,Maybe I over-committed.
00:39:50.429,00:39:51.972,But you're wrong about Shaun.
00:39:52.056,00:39:54.475,He's gonna handle anything you throw at him.
00:39:56.644,00:40:04.276,"Either way, if he succeeds, I'm the guy who just backed him. And if he fails, I'm the president."
00:40:22.878,00:40:24.380,Everything went great.
00:40:24.713,00:40:27.133,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
00:40:27.216,00:40:29.093,-There were complications. -But I'm okay?
00:40:29.760,00:40:32.304,-Yeah. But the surgery… -I don't care.
00:40:33.180,00:40:34.598,You saved me. Thank you.
00:40:35.057,00:40:36.642,My son's going to be here soon.
00:40:36.725,00:40:39.562,"I told him you said it would be okay, but he flew in any way."
00:40:40.938,00:40:42.148,You saved me.
00:40:45.985,00:40:48.487,You're gonna be a beautiful mother of the groom.
00:41:14.180,00:41:16.724,"Go on in, take a bow. You've earned it."
00:41:17.141,00:41:19.059,Why does it matter who gets credit?
00:41:20.311,00:41:26.025,It matters because the people who get credit… They don't have to do scut work.
00:41:37.077,00:41:39.914,"Dr. Murphy, thank you so much."
00:41:43.375,00:41:44.293,Thank you.
00:00:01.293,00:00:02.711,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:02.753,00:00:07.048,Ethan: How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?
00:00:07.090,00:00:08.258,No!
00:00:08.300,00:00:10.051,Would you stop petting that stupid rabbit?!
00:00:11.052,00:00:12.220,We're never going home again.
00:00:12.262,00:00:14.222,"We have each other, and that's all we need."
00:00:14.849,00:00:17.309,Aah!
00:00:17.351,00:00:19.979,Your fiancé sure can handle a knife.
00:00:20.020,00:00:21.814,He's got a serious deficit.
00:00:21.856,00:00:24.232,"So, are you proud or disappointed?"
00:00:24.274,00:00:26.401,"Marcus, stop making everything so personal."
00:00:26.443,00:00:27.987,You've wanted his job since day one.
00:00:28.028,00:00:29.279,Everyone in this room knows that.
00:00:29.321,00:00:30.572,How did you...
00:00:30.614,00:00:32.157,It's my job to know everything.
00:00:32.199,00:00:35.911,"Since I work for you, doesn't that make all this actually your fault?"
00:00:35.953,00:00:37.412,I stopped listening after I work for you.
00:00:37.454,00:00:40.165,A surgeon needs to communicate.
00:00:40.207,00:00:41.375,Can he do that under stress?
00:00:41.416,00:00:45.546,Can he do that knowing that a human life literally hangs in the balance?
00:01:41.769,00:01:45.397,"So, I'm in the middle of Uncharted, and I'm dead."
00:01:45.439,00:01:47.900,Can I borrow some triples A's?
00:01:47.942,00:01:50.527,I'm your neighbor.
00:01:50.569,00:01:51.528,Hello.
00:01:51.570,00:01:53.572,34?
00:01:53.614,00:01:55.824,I moved in last week.
00:01:55.866,00:01:57.785,"Yeah, I know."
00:01:57.826,00:01:59.286,I work at a hospital.
00:01:59.327,00:02:00.788,That's cool.
00:02:00.829,00:02:02.456,Yes.
00:02:02.497,00:02:05.000,"Triple A's, por favor?"
00:02:05.042,00:02:06.919,Batteries.
00:02:06.961,00:02:08.253,Right.
00:02:08.295,00:02:10.338,Do you have any?
00:02:21.809,00:02:23.518,Triple A batteries.
00:02:23.560,00:02:24.853,Thank you.
00:02:24.895,00:02:26.688,Piece of advice -- don't feed the cat.
00:02:26.730,00:02:28.023,Which cat?
00:02:28.065,00:02:29.858,"Feed it once, and it'll never leave you alone."
00:02:29.900,00:02:33.236,"Thank you for the batteries, neighbor."
00:02:36.657,00:02:39.326,You're welcome!
00:02:41.453,00:02:44.247,"Woman on P.A.: Dr. Forrest, dial 118, please."
00:02:44.289,00:02:47.501,"Dr. Forrest, please dial 1-1-8."
00:02:50.087,00:02:52.589,Surgical.
00:02:52.631,00:02:55.509,"Well, you're in luck because I'm not a nurse, I'm a surgical resident."
00:02:55.550,00:02:57.594,How can I help you?
00:03:01.515,00:03:03.182,"Man on P.A.: Michael Crawford, 8-1-0."
00:03:03.224,00:03:06.185,"Michael Crawford, please call 8-1-0."
00:03:08.229,00:03:09.648,We got a liver for Chuck!
00:03:09.690,00:03:11.108,Where?
00:03:11.150,00:03:13.276,And how long do we have body-to-body on the liver transplant?
00:03:13.318,00:03:14.402,Eight hours.
00:03:14.444,00:03:16.363,You don't know the longevity of a liver?
00:03:16.404,00:03:18.657,"This is a teaching hospital, and I'm the teacher."
00:03:20.826,00:03:22.828,Check the health and bring the liver back from SFM.
00:03:22.870,00:03:25.204,I was at Chuck's intake.
00:03:22.870,00:03:27.875,I'd really like to be -- Now you're gonna be at the intake for his new liver.
00:03:27.916,00:03:29.668,"Jared, get Chuck down here and get him prepped."
00:03:29.710,00:03:33.005,"We got eight hours on this thing, and the clock starts ticking now."
00:03:36.758,00:03:53.734,"-- Captions by VITAC -- Woman on P.A.: Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please."
00:03:53.775,00:03:55.069,Dr. Bender.
00:03:55.110,00:03:57.529,"I'm not interrupting your pre-game, am I?"
00:03:57.571,00:04:00.782,I think this is my 400th breast reconstruction.
00:04:00.824,00:04:03.660,The board should give me a plaque.
00:04:03.702,00:04:04.828,What's up?
00:04:04.870,00:04:05.996,Your 4:00 P.M.
00:04:06.038,00:04:07.372,The V.I.P. -- Wannamaker.
00:04:07.414,00:04:08.707,Yes! The Free-Flap.
00:04:08.749,00:04:11.752,"He's checked into the penthouse suite, resting comfortably I'm sure."
00:04:11.793,00:04:14.462,"I've been working on him for awhile now, and he's close."
00:04:14.504,00:04:17.298,He's real close to making the Foundation his tax relief.
00:04:17.340,00:04:18.217,That's good to hear.
00:04:18.258,00:04:20.177,I want aces on this.
00:04:20.219,00:04:23.097,Everything perfect.
00:04:23.138,00:04:25.224,That's good to know.
00:04:26.892,00:04:28.727,"Woman on P.A.: Dr. Bender to the mental ward, please."
00:04:28.769,00:04:30.812,Dr. Bender.
00:04:30.854,00:04:33.190,Is this the chairman's version of a pep talk?
00:04:33.232,00:04:36.110,I'm looking for a fail-safe outcome on the procedure.
00:04:36.151,00:04:40.447,I want you to use Dr. Melendez as your second.
00:04:40.488,00:04:43.283,That's your fail-safe?
00:04:43.324,00:04:44.993,I'm your Chief of Surgery.
00:04:45.035,00:04:48.163,It's just a precaution to guarantee a perfect outcome.
00:04:48.205,00:04:49.456,Are you doubting my abilities?
00:04:49.497,00:04:51.041,Wannamaker is important.
00:04:51.083,00:04:53.961,Everything has to be perfect.
00:04:54.002,00:04:56.130,You said that already.
00:04:56.171,00:04:58.132,I'm your fail-safe.
00:04:58.173,00:04:59.967,The V.I.P. will be fine.
00:05:04.721,00:05:06.598,How you doing?
00:05:06.640,00:05:08.892,I know these sounds and everything might be a lot for you.
00:05:08.934,00:05:10.936,It's -- it's hard for anyone.
00:05:10.978,00:05:13.438,I like helicopters.
00:05:13.480,00:05:16.775,"I, uh, didn't know you'd been on a helicopter."
00:05:16.817,00:05:19.027,I haven't.
00:05:36.335,00:05:40.257,15 minutes to San Francisco Municipal Hospital.
00:05:40.299,00:05:43.760,Should be a smooth ride.
00:06:03.362,00:06:05.907,"You do know what this is, right?"
00:06:05.949,00:06:09.328,"Well, I'll tell you what it is."
00:06:09.368,00:06:13.456,"Jared gets the golden ticket, and we get..."
00:06:13.498,00:06:15.500,pizza delivery.
00:06:23.508,00:06:25.426,"The rotors just go round and round, Shaun."
00:06:25.468,00:06:27.304,They don't change.
00:06:42.903,00:06:46.073,How do I talk to you?
00:06:47.782,00:06:49.743,"So, Chuck, any chest pains, shortness of breath?"
00:06:49.784,00:06:51.036,No.
00:06:51.078,00:06:52.120,Any alcohol in the last six months?
00:06:52.162,00:06:53.580,No.
00:06:53.621,00:06:55.374,-Here comes a quick pinch.
00:06:55.414,00:06:57.876,It's Walmart on Black Friday in here.
00:06:57.918,00:06:59.878,Things speed way up when you're having a transplant.
00:06:59.920,00:07:01.255,I like it.
00:07:01.296,00:07:02.797,It's good energy.
00:07:04.174,00:07:06.843,No.
00:07:06.885,00:07:09.428,"I feel lousy all the time, pretty much."
00:07:09.470,00:07:14.101,"But...I've got a second chance, you know, with this liver."
00:07:14.142,00:07:15.227,Sure.
00:07:16.270,00:07:18.105,Oh! Excuse me.
00:07:18.146,00:07:19.522,I already spoke to Mom.
00:07:19.564,00:07:21.858,"A-And Uncle Tommy, too."
00:07:21.900,00:07:25.279,"Yeah, I need to see your face."
00:07:25.320,00:07:26.654,All right.
00:07:26.696,00:07:27.864,I love you.
00:07:27.906,00:07:29.283,Bye.
00:07:29.324,00:07:31.743,She just graduated from law school at Cal.
00:07:31.785,00:07:32.994,I told you that.
00:07:33.036,00:07:34.996,"Uh, no."
00:07:35.038,00:07:37.165,"I must've told Dr. Browne, then."
00:07:37.207,00:07:38.583,Where is Dr. Browne?
00:07:47.008,00:07:48.135,Here's your liver.
00:07:48.176,00:07:49.469,I'm going to need you to sign for it.
00:07:49.510,00:07:52.722,Standard operating procedure is the leave the liver in the safety of the body cavity.
00:07:52.764,00:07:54.141,I'm aware of the procedure.
00:07:54.182,00:07:57.936,"We had a John Doe at the top of the registry, but that John Doe died before we could plant."
00:07:57.978,00:07:59.562,How long ago did you take it out?
00:07:59.604,00:08:00.563,Three hours.
00:08:00.605,00:08:02.399,We just lost three hours.
00:08:02.441,00:08:04.859,Technically three hours and five minutes.
00:08:04.901,00:08:06.236,True clock is on the cooler.
00:08:06.278,00:08:09.656,Shaun: Can't go below 39 degrees or above 47 degrees.
00:08:09.697,00:08:12.533,You want to sign for it?
00:08:17.580,00:08:20.041,Tissue looks healthy.
00:08:21.709,00:08:24.254,What are you doing?
00:08:24.296,00:08:25.755,What are you looking for?
00:08:25.797,00:08:28.133,What's he doing?
00:08:34.555,00:08:36.057,"Shaun, what are you looking for?"
00:08:36.099,00:08:37.476,Masses? Cysts?
00:08:37.517,00:08:38.768,They're clean.
00:08:38.810,00:08:40.270,You think we'd miss a tumor?
00:08:40.312,00:08:42.397,There's nothing there.
00:08:44.191,00:08:46.360,I know.
00:08:46.401,00:08:48.278,There's nothing there.
00:08:48.320,00:08:51.781,"Okay, the liver needs to go back into cold storage, and we got to go."
00:08:56.828,00:09:00.665,...then I'll release the vascular clamp and let your blood perfuse in your donor liver.
00:09:00.707,00:09:02.334,That's it?
00:09:00.707,00:09:03.877,"Connect the bile ducts, sew you up, and then we wait."
00:09:03.918,00:09:06.087,the new one always take?
00:09:06.129,00:09:08.173,Over 70% of the time.
00:09:08.215,00:09:09.716,"Oh, I can live with those odds."
00:09:11.468,00:09:12.635,You get some rest.
00:09:12.677,00:09:14.721,See you later.
00:09:14.762,00:09:17.098,He looks at something. I don't know what he's looking at.
00:09:17.140,00:09:18.683,"Is he, you know, is -- is he curious?"
00:09:18.725,00:09:20.352,Is he concerned?
00:09:20.394,00:09:22.603,Glassman: You're having trouble communicating with him.
00:09:22.645,00:09:24.356,It's a weekday. It's Shaun.
00:09:24.398,00:09:26.233,"Hm, let's see."
00:09:26.274,00:09:28.026,He seemed different at the hospital.
00:09:28.068,00:09:30.153,I could kind of talk to him.
00:09:30.195,00:09:32.406,"Well, he knows what to expect in the hospital."
00:09:32.447,00:09:34.199,"Outside, everything's different."
00:09:34.241,00:09:35.116,New stimuli.
00:09:35.158,00:09:36.451,"So, what do I do?"
00:09:36.493,00:09:37.869,I-I...I don't know what he's thinking.
00:09:37.911,00:09:41.415,"Claire, you're not gonna figure out what he's thinking, so don't even try."
00:09:41.456,00:09:44.709,"In fact, if he's thinking about something in his own mind, just let him be."
00:09:44.751,00:09:46.420,I'd appreciate it if people gave me the same courtesy.
00:09:46.461,00:09:53.260,"I thought with your history -- Claire, if you want to connect with him, you're gonna have to figure out your own way in."
00:09:53.301,00:09:54.219,How's Chuck?
00:09:54.261,00:09:55.220,Chuck? Chuck's fine.
00:09:55.262,00:09:56.637,He's waiting for a liver.
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.432,"So come home, please."
00:09:58.473,00:10:00.183,Okay.
00:10:03.144,00:10:04.771,Katt: Doctor.
00:10:04.812,00:10:05.855,What's up?
00:10:05.897,00:10:07.899,I just wanted to thank you.
00:10:07.941,00:10:09.150,I haven't done anything yet.
00:10:09.192,00:10:10.485,You have.
00:10:10.527,00:10:12.779,You've given my dad hope.
00:10:18.410,00:10:20.328,"You know, Chuck was my first patient."
00:10:20.370,00:10:24.207,"Six months ago, first day at St. Bonaventure, I get a liver failure."
00:10:24.249,00:10:27.502,And the nicest guy in the world.
00:10:27.544,00:10:29.463,I wanted to be the one to give him the good news.
00:10:29.504,00:10:32.840,Shaun: We're not leaving.
00:10:32.882,00:10:34.384,You said you liked helicopters.
00:10:34.426,00:10:36.177,We are not leaving.
00:10:36.219,00:10:38.221,We -- We made it here safe.
00:10:38.263,00:10:40.557,"Yes, we are not leaving."
00:10:40.599,00:10:42.392,We're not leaving.
00:10:42.434,00:10:45.686,Fog's rolling in too quick.
00:10:45.728,00:10:48.440,Does that mean it rolls out quick?
00:10:48.482,00:10:49.983,Could be an hour.
00:10:50.024,00:10:52.860,Don't know.
00:10:52.902,00:10:54.988,"Okay, uh..."
00:10:58.492,00:11:01.202,Claire: Excuse me! I need an ambulance to St. Bonaventure.
00:11:01.244,00:11:02.787,Sorry.
00:11:02.829,00:11:04.623,I've got a pile-up on I-80 and four other vehicles out on call.
00:11:04.664,00:11:06.833,Not one ambulance?
00:11:11.754,00:11:13.214,Let me be clear -- this is emergent.
00:11:13.256,00:11:14.257,It's time sensitive.
00:11:14.299,00:11:15.925,"Honey, this ain't Hertz."
00:11:18.886,00:11:20.639,What about a police escort?
00:11:22.641,00:11:25.018,That can be arranged.
00:11:30.857,00:11:32.025,Of course.
00:11:32.066,00:11:33.860,Andrews: Don't want to ruin the festivities.
00:11:33.901,00:11:37.280,"But if I could just get a few minutes with my patient, alone."
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.827,Mr. Wannamaker.
00:11:43.870,00:11:47.081,Dr. Andrews.
00:11:47.706,00:11:49.125,How we doing today?
00:11:49.167,00:11:50.751,Incomplete.
00:11:50.793,00:11:53.754,Let's see what we can do about that.
00:11:53.796,00:11:56.466,Look here.
00:11:56.508,00:12:01.262,"Well, looking not too bad considering we cut out a tumor less than two weeks ago."
00:12:01.304,00:12:04.599,"Yeah, I've been walking around with a hole in my mouth."
00:12:04.641,00:12:07.561,Ever drink Scotch with a hole in your mouth?
00:12:07.602,00:12:09.229,Waste of good Scotch.
00:12:09.270,00:12:12.065,to give it time to heal.
00:12:12.106,00:12:15.276,"Yeah, yeah. You told me."
00:12:15.318,00:12:17.529,Have you continued to smoke?
00:12:17.571,00:12:20.907,"It constricts the vessels, slows the healing."
00:12:20.948,00:12:22.909,I'm not a quitter.
00:12:25.328,00:12:34.337,We are going to graft some skin from your leg and fix that cheek up better than new.
00:12:34.379,00:12:36.214,I'm a real estate guy.
00:12:36.256,00:12:38.299,There's an old saying -- You can have it fast.
00:12:38.341,00:12:39.926,You can have it good.
00:12:39.967,00:12:42.053,Pick two.
00:12:42.095,00:12:43.680,It's not gonna be cheap.
00:12:45.973,00:12:48.476,I like doctors like you.
00:12:48.518,00:12:50.687,"You're good, and you know it."
00:12:53.523,00:12:56.025,Claire: Yes. It was harvested before we got there.
00:12:56.067,00:12:57.776,We're waiting for transportation.
00:12:57.818,00:13:00.280,The itinerary and the life clock have changed.
00:13:00.321,00:13:01.948,"Yeah, uh..."
00:13:01.989,00:13:05.243,Excuse me! Are you talking to the hospital?
00:13:05.285,00:13:10.789,"Have someone tell Dr. Glassman that I might be late for our lunch, please."
00:13:10.831,00:13:12.375,Yeah.
00:13:18.673,00:13:21.301,"So, how did you know about the weather?"
00:13:21.342,00:13:23.802,Is it some kind of gift?
00:13:24.763,00:13:27.181,"Come on, I got to know."
00:13:27.223,00:13:29.934,"What, Shaun Murphy is Zeus?"
00:13:29.976,00:13:32.019,I watch The Weather Channel.
00:13:38.610,00:13:40.278,You my doctors?
00:13:42.196,00:13:43.490,Shaun?
00:13:43.531,00:13:46.409,"Shaun, we got to go!"
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.387,You're home.
00:14:06.429,00:14:10.725,Your dad and mom have had a tough night with your brother and all.
00:14:10.767,00:14:11.768,Come on. Let's go.
00:14:11.810,00:14:14.604,No! No!
00:14:14.646,00:14:17.023,He -- He promised me!
00:14:17.064,00:14:19.275,He...He promised me!
00:14:19.317,00:14:21.695,He promised!
00:14:30.745,00:14:34.374,"I think we'll get there much quicker if we drive, Shaun."
00:14:39.671,00:14:42.632,"C-Could you turn off the flashers, please?"
00:14:52.851,00:14:54.602,What's the patient's name?
00:14:54.644,00:14:55.895,I told you. It's Chuck.
00:14:55.936,00:14:57.564,No.
00:14:57.605,00:14:59.399,No. The -- The donor?
00:14:59.440,00:15:00.817,What's his name?
00:15:00.859,00:15:03.152,What? The liver?
00:15:04.987,00:15:07.741,Oliver?
00:15:07.782,00:15:09.367,Oliver.
00:15:19.377,00:15:20.879,"Hey, you got a second?"
00:15:20.920,00:15:22.088,What's up?
00:15:22.129,00:15:23.882,Just waiting on a liver.
00:15:23.923,00:15:26.426,Transplant.
00:15:26.467,00:15:29.429,They'd trade their liver to do the liver.
00:15:32.849,00:15:33.767,What's his name?
00:15:33.808,00:15:34.975,Wannamaker.
00:15:35.017,00:15:36.644,You got the transplant.
00:15:36.686,00:15:38.312,That should keep any attending busy.
00:15:38.354,00:15:40.440,"Well, I can make time."
00:15:42.108,00:15:43.568,"Look, I get it."
00:15:43.610,00:15:44.819,That's right.
00:15:44.861,00:15:46.195,"Look, this -- this isn't a coup."
00:15:46.237,00:15:47.988,What is it?
00:15:48.030,00:15:51.200,It's about making sure this hospital is first on Wannamaker's donation list.
00:15:51.242,00:15:52.869,I'm aware of the stakes.
00:15:52.911,00:15:55.079,Thanks for coming by.
00:15:57.039,00:16:00.835,"You know, it doesn't make you any less of a surgeon, having me in there as your second."
00:16:00.877,00:16:02.295,I'm the Chief.
00:16:02.336,00:16:03.797,Can't argue with that.
00:16:03.838,00:16:06.424,And we both know what your presence in my O.R. will say.
00:16:06.466,00:16:07.967,That's not my intention.
00:16:08.008,00:16:09.886,It's the impact.
00:16:09.928,00:16:13.431,Thanks...but I'm good.
00:16:26.903,00:16:29.405,These can't be right.
00:16:29.447,00:16:30.782,"Whatever it is, it's right."
00:16:30.824,00:16:32.032,Chuck's labs.
00:16:32.074,00:16:34.034,It's got to be a false flag or a bad reading.
00:16:34.076,00:16:35.077,For what?
00:16:35.119,00:16:37.246,Medications? Foods?
00:16:41.459,00:16:44.044,"Look, if this is right, we lose our transplant."
00:16:44.086,00:16:47.131,I'm sorry. That doesn't change the results.
00:16:47.173,00:16:50.217,There's alcohol in his system.
00:16:50.259,00:16:51.552,He drank.
00:16:51.594,00:16:53.513,The blood doesn't lie.
00:16:55.932,00:16:57.600,Run the lab again.
00:17:00.979,00:17:02.730,E.T.A. to St. Bonaventure?
00:17:02.772,00:17:05.149,70 minutes.
00:17:11.030,00:17:13.115,What are you looking for?
00:17:13.157,00:17:15.785,What do you see?
00:17:15.827,00:17:17.495,I have a girl neighbor.
00:17:17.537,00:17:19.539,Okay.
00:17:20.874,00:17:23.960,Is she nice?
00:17:24.002,00:17:28.840,What does she do?
00:17:28.882,00:17:31.384,Do you know her name?
00:17:36.723,00:17:39.600,What the hell are you looking for on the scans?
00:17:41.728,00:17:42.729,What the...
00:17:42.770,00:17:44.522,The temperature is going up!
00:17:44.564,00:17:47.441,"Officer, we need to find a place with ice, like, now!"
00:17:51.863,00:17:53.614,"Jared: I tested it, Chuck."
00:17:53.656,00:17:55.742,Talk to me.
00:17:55.783,00:17:58.870,You know the six-month rule.
00:17:58.912,00:18:02.248,Was it a craving?
00:18:02.289,00:18:05.001,My daughter's graduation.
00:18:09.797,00:18:12.842,Nobody in my family had ever gone to college.
00:18:15.929,00:18:17.388,There she was.
00:18:18.472,00:18:22.351,My little girl wearing the robes.
00:18:24.395,00:18:29.943,"And for just that day, I...I wanted to be normal."
00:18:32.486,00:18:37.617,"So, I...I had a glass of champagne."
00:18:43.957,00:18:45.291,You're out of ice?
00:18:45.332,00:18:47.376,It's broken. Supermarket's about three miles down.
00:18:47.418,00:18:49.128,We don't have time.
00:18:51.297,00:18:53.049,Okay. Okay.
00:18:59.931,00:19:01.933,The temperature's already at 47 degrees.
00:19:01.975,00:19:03.601,We can't let it go any higher.
00:19:08.731,00:19:10.817,Are you gonna help me?
00:19:12.151,00:19:15.446,It's sweet.
00:19:27.125,00:19:29.168,What should I do with him?
00:19:29.209,00:19:32.046,Deputy: Child Services is down in Cheyenne.
00:19:32.088,00:19:36.050,"That's 150 miles, and they'll just turn me around and send me back to the parents."
00:19:36.092,00:19:38.928,The parents don't want him?
00:19:38.970,00:19:40.387,I don't know.
00:19:40.429,00:19:43.850,"He doesn't seem to want the parents, that's for sure."
00:19:43.891,00:19:45.351,You can take him to do the hospital.
00:19:45.392,00:19:47.603,Social worker there.
00:19:52.525,00:19:54.986,That won't work.
00:19:55.028,00:19:56.236,How do you know?
00:19:56.278,00:19:58.280,Shaun?
00:20:00.366,00:20:03.243,You're right.
00:20:03.285,00:20:05.038,Shaun!
00:20:05.079,00:20:06.956,Are you even listening to me?!
00:20:06.998,00:20:08.082,Just one drink?
00:20:08.124,00:20:10.751,That's what he said.
00:20:10.793,00:20:13.171,Should I inform the registry?
00:20:13.212,00:20:15.089,How long ago did Chuck have that drink?
00:20:15.131,00:20:16.507,Three days ago.
00:20:16.549,00:20:18.134,Give me your marker.
00:20:26.142,00:20:28.978,That's...
00:20:29.020,00:20:32.190,Estimated blood-alcohol content.
00:20:34.316,00:20:35.818,What type of alcohol?
00:20:35.860,00:20:37.361,"Uh, champagne."
00:20:37.403,00:20:38.654,What percentage of alcohol is that?
00:20:38.696,00:20:39.822,I don't know.
00:20:39.864,00:20:42.950,Take out your phone and look it up.
00:20:42.992,00:20:45.078,I don't know why it's not working!
00:20:45.119,00:20:47.747,It needs to be submerged to cool.
00:21:03.096,00:21:06.849,Cashier: Hey!
00:21:06.891,00:21:11.562,"Why did you answer me the last time, but not before?"
00:21:11.604,00:21:14.607,Was it because I was angry?
00:21:14.648,00:21:16.316,Was it random?
00:21:16.358,00:21:19.278,Why can't you answer my questions?
00:21:23.449,00:21:24.951,This better work.
00:21:24.992,00:21:27.036,It will work.
00:21:29.038,00:21:31.791,You answer when I don't ask.
00:21:34.835,00:21:36.295,You don't like questions.
00:21:36.336,00:21:38.131,I don't.
00:21:44.720,00:21:46.305,I didn't do well in calculus.
00:21:46.346,00:21:47.890,This is algebra.
00:21:47.932,00:21:53.437,"With his severe cirrhosis, his alcohol-clearance rate is one milligram per deciliter per hour."
00:21:56.232,00:21:58.192,"One drink, say eight ounces..."
00:21:58.234,00:21:59.568,"If it's champagne, six ounces, tops."
00:21:59.610,00:22:00.736,Play it conservative.
00:22:00.778,00:22:06.242,Eight ounces results in a blood alcohol level of 39 milligrams per deciliter.
00:22:06.284,00:22:08.953,One standard drink.
00:22:10.163,00:22:15.126,"Now, the purpose of abstinence, at least according to the transplant registry is..."
00:22:15.168,00:22:19.964,Patients who kill their livers due to excessive drinking prove they can be sober.
00:22:20.006,00:22:22.675,Let me see that report.
00:22:22.716,00:22:25.928,0.02.
00:22:25.970,00:22:27.721,Chuck was telling the truth.
00:22:27.763,00:22:29.347,He did have just the one drink.
00:22:29.389,00:22:30.850,He didn't fall off the wagon.
00:22:30.891,00:22:33.060,Corporate loves its data.
00:22:33.102,00:22:39.066,"I'm not sure it'll actually make a difference, but it does give us an argument."
00:22:39.108,00:22:41.235,Genius.
00:22:53.164,00:22:55.041,You don't like the cafeteria food?
00:22:55.082,00:22:56.876,They only make one thing well.
00:22:56.917,00:23:01.088,What does it say when the staff sees the President of the hospital not eating their cafeteria food?
00:23:01.130,00:23:06.177,"Well, it says the President of the hospital isn't allowed in the kitchen."
00:23:06.219,00:23:08.095,You sat down.
00:23:08.137,00:23:10.348,I'd like your advice.
00:23:10.388,00:23:11.598,Really?
00:23:11.640,00:23:14.227,Where's Aoki?
00:23:14.268,00:23:15.519,This was a mistake.
00:23:15.561,00:23:17.146,That's insulting.
00:23:17.188,00:23:20.566,"At least hear what I have to say, and then decide it's bad advice."
00:23:20.607,00:23:23.610,Sit.
00:23:23.652,00:23:26.572,Aoki is pushing Melendez on me for the VIP.
00:23:26.613,00:23:28.490,Ah. You didn't get the e-mail blast.
00:23:28.532,00:23:30.993,Rich people aren't allowed to die in this hospital.
00:23:31.035,00:23:32.786,You're not the young star anymore.
00:23:32.828,00:23:33.996,Melendez is.
00:23:34.038,00:23:35.373,I know that.
00:23:35.413,00:23:36.999,And you're upset about the why?
00:23:37.041,00:23:38.959,Why does Aoki think that?
00:23:39.001,00:23:40.211,You should be asking who.
00:23:40.253,00:23:42.713,Who? I know who.
00:23:42.755,00:23:44.257,Who are you?
00:23:44.298,00:23:48.468,"Are you a Chief who wants to be surgeon, or are you a Chief who wants to be president?"
00:23:48.510,00:23:55.101,"'Cause if it's the latter, take your ego, shove it in a cupboard somewhere, and start acting presidential."
00:24:04.944,00:24:07.905,Dr. Melendez is going to argue to the board that you get this liver.
00:24:07.947,00:24:10.448,And I think it's a pretty good argument.
00:24:10.490,00:24:12.868,Do I deserve it?
00:24:12.910,00:24:15.495,I'm...not sure that's relevant.
00:24:18.498,00:24:20.458,You know...
00:24:20.500,00:24:29.093,"when you're dying, and I've been dying for a long time, you start to think about your life."
00:24:31.595,00:24:34.807,I haven't led a great one.
00:24:34.848,00:24:37.684,I could've been a better dad.
00:24:37.726,00:24:39.686,A better man.
00:24:41.730,00:24:46.193,News flash -- I drank too much.
00:24:48.904,00:24:52.699,Yeah.
00:24:52.741,00:24:55.119,I haven't seen him in three years.
00:24:56.662,00:25:01.792,"Getting a liver is not a second chance, and it's not a reward for being perfect."
00:25:01.834,00:25:03.877,It's just what we can do.
00:25:03.919,00:25:06.464,Maybe.
00:25:06.504,00:25:12.428,"But on the registry, all of us wait in line together."
00:25:16.140,00:25:19.517,"these people here, waiting."
00:25:21.187,00:25:23.772,I know their faces.
00:25:23.814,00:25:26.317,Even their names.
00:25:29.445,00:25:32.614,We're in it together.
00:25:32.656,00:25:35.368,And I...
00:25:38.536,00:25:40.789,Chuck? Chuck!
00:25:40.831,00:25:42.166,Chuck?
00:25:42.208,00:25:43.417,"Chuck, can you hear me?"
00:25:53.219,00:25:55.221,All right.
00:25:57.890,00:26:00.767,He's got blood in his esophagus.
00:26:00.809,00:26:02.186,He's got a variceal bleed.
00:26:02.228,00:26:05.314,All right. Saline wide open.
00:26:20.413,00:26:23.040,Pressure's coming up.
00:26:42.309,00:26:43.352,Chuck had a variceal bleed.
00:26:43.394,00:26:44.395,I was in there.
00:26:44.437,00:26:46.939,"Portal hypertension, decompensated -- Are you finished?"
00:26:46.980,00:26:51.527,"He's got three months to live, maybe."
00:26:51.569,00:26:54.863,You have to be six-months alcohol free before you're registry eligible.
00:26:54.905,00:26:57.366,And you said you weren't good at math.
00:26:59.368,00:27:02.746,He gets this one or he dies.
00:27:10.588,00:27:12.672,You know what this thing looks like at 8:00 A.M.?
00:27:12.714,00:27:15.134,I need a police escort to work every morning.
00:27:15.175,00:27:16.969,280 South.
00:27:17.010,00:27:18.471,Where are all roads meet.
00:27:21.932,00:27:25.185,"No, they don't!"
00:27:33.110,00:27:36.822,-What's wrong with him?
00:27:36.863,00:27:38.782,Officer: What's that mean?
00:27:38.824,00:27:40.451,Does he need to be in a hospital?
00:27:40.493,00:27:42.869,The last place he should be is a hospital.
00:28:05.392,00:28:07.853,What are you doing?
00:28:07.894,00:28:09.480,Shaun?
00:28:09.522,00:28:11.357,What are you thinking?
00:28:18.905,00:28:21.867,"I just...I don't know what you're looking for, Shaun."
00:28:21.908,00:28:24.244,"Yes, I can feel it."
00:28:24.286,00:28:27.122,And?
00:28:27.164,00:28:28.541,I don't know what that means.
00:28:28.582,00:28:30.668,"There must be a clot, but there isn't a clot."
00:28:30.708,00:28:32.836,The scan showed no clot.
00:28:40.927,00:28:45.224,That's because the scans were taken before they harvested the liver.
00:28:45.265,00:28:47.809,Prior to the liver being flushed with UW solution!
00:28:47.851,00:28:49.061,It's dying!
00:28:49.102,00:28:54.525,"To preserve the liver, they replace all its blood with a solution to protect it from the cold storage, but they must've left some blood behind, which clotted."
00:28:54.567,00:28:56.318,How long to St. Bonaventure?
00:28:56.360,00:28:58.278,-Less than 30 minutes.
00:28:58.320,00:29:02.408,We have to immediately remove the clot and flush the left lobe to protect it from the ice bath.
00:29:02.449,00:29:03.617,We need to stop the car.
00:29:03.659,00:29:04.743,Here?
00:29:04.784,00:29:06.662,"We need to operate right here, right now."
00:29:22.010,00:29:23.387,Flush this from the right.
00:29:23.429,00:29:26.640,"So, the left lobe, starting at the middle hepatic vein."
00:29:26.682,00:29:31.645,Less intrusive cut would be along the falciform ligament to allow access to Segment III.
00:29:31.687,00:29:34.565,"When you locate the blockage, I'm gonna have to remove it."
00:29:59.339,00:30:00.758,Okay.
00:30:00.799,00:30:03.552,"I need a straw to cannulate the vein, please."
00:30:03.594,00:30:05.137,There's a straw in my cup.
00:30:13.228,00:30:16.273,UW solution will stabilize the cell walls.
00:30:16.315,00:30:19.777,Preserve the integrity of the organ.
00:30:34.750,00:30:36.876,This is better than having a baby in my car.
00:30:43.425,00:30:44.843,How are you feeling?
00:30:44.884,00:30:47.387,Like I'm writing a blank check.
00:30:47.429,00:30:48.930,You're gonna be fine.
00:30:48.972,00:30:50.599,You're the best.
00:30:57.606,00:31:01.276,"This bleed, these varices -- this isn't good news."
00:31:01.318,00:31:05.238,Tells us that your liver failure has progressed considerably.
00:31:05.280,00:31:07.533,How much?
00:31:07.574,00:31:09.535,You have two to three months.
00:31:09.576,00:31:12.120,"We're getting the liver today, in an hour."
00:31:12.162,00:31:14.707,I don't get it.
00:31:14.748,00:31:15.957,You didn't tell them.
00:31:15.999,00:31:17.835,What?
00:31:17.876,00:31:20.629,Your father had a drink.
00:31:20.671,00:31:23.215,He had one glass.
00:31:23.256,00:31:25.676,Transplant registry doesn't quantify things like that.
00:31:25.718,00:31:27.511,So he doesn't get the liver?
00:31:27.553,00:31:29.095,I'm gonna try and get it for him.
00:31:29.137,00:31:30.681,"What are you, a car salesman?"
00:31:30.723,00:31:32.015,"What, you're gonna try?"
00:31:32.057,00:31:34.017,The final decision is out of my hands.
00:31:38.689,00:31:40.858,And if you fail?
00:31:40.899,00:31:43.193,I'm gonna do everything that I can.
00:31:43.235,00:31:46.446,I am meeting with the committee in 10 minutes.
00:31:48.741,00:31:50.784,Excuse me.
00:31:55.873,00:31:58.458,I handed my dad the drink.
00:31:58.500,00:32:00.502,Doesn't matter how it happened.
00:32:00.544,00:32:03.422,He didn't want it.
00:32:03.463,00:32:06.592,"If you let him die, I will have killed my father."
00:32:34.202,00:32:35.537,It was a glass.
00:32:35.579,00:32:37.956,A glass of champagne at his daughter's graduation.
00:32:37.997,00:32:39.499,I have the labs to prove it.
00:32:39.541,00:32:40.751,Chuck didn't fall off the wagon.
00:32:40.793,00:32:42.753,He had one drink and never went back.
00:32:42.795,00:32:46.172,The transplant registry guidelines don't play in the gray for a reason.
00:32:46.214,00:32:47.466,Those guidelines are so arbitrary.
00:32:47.507,00:32:48.801,Have one drink and you die.
00:32:50.761,00:32:53.472,"Hepatitis B from careless sexual practice, nope."
00:32:53.513,00:32:54.765,Nothing at all about that.
00:32:54.807,00:32:56.475,"So, what do you want us to do?"
00:32:56.516,00:32:58.435,I want us not to hide behind them.
00:32:58.477,00:33:00.562,We do have a responsibility.
00:33:00.604,00:33:02.522,"Without the rules, we're playing God."
00:33:02.564,00:33:03.690,We need the rules.
00:33:03.732,00:33:05.358,Does that help you sleep better at night?
00:33:05.400,00:33:08.403,"Yes, it does."
00:33:08.445,00:33:12.783,"We have one liver today, and 800 people in this state need it."
00:33:12.825,00:33:14.993,I don't want to be haunted by the other 799.
00:33:15.034,00:33:16.662,Your guy hasn't earned it.
00:33:19.331,00:33:20.874,it's a technicality.
00:33:20.916,00:33:22.668,"No, the drink is a technicality."
00:33:22.709,00:33:24.377,"Jessica, what's the legal burden here?"
00:33:24.419,00:33:25.587,Significant.
00:33:25.629,00:33:30.049,"If we move forward with this transplant, we could lose privileges from the registry."
00:33:30.091,00:33:32.135,-If it were discovered.
00:33:32.177,00:33:34.179,How narrow can you be about this?
00:33:34.220,00:33:36.682,"Dr. Glassman, where are you on this?"
00:33:36.723,00:33:38.809,I can make a good argument either way.
00:33:40.393,00:33:42.938,Better to remove the arguments all together.
00:33:42.980,00:33:44.523,What the hell is he talking about?
00:33:44.564,00:33:48.652,All I'm talking about is that we have a patient in this hospital who needs a liver.
00:33:48.694,00:33:51.697,We also just happen to have a liver that needs a patient.
00:33:51.738,00:33:52.948,It's not that simple.
00:33:52.990,00:33:55.450,It is that simple if you consider the patient.
00:33:55.492,00:33:57.911,Rules are secondary.
00:33:57.953,00:34:03.750,But is saving this patient worth the risk of not being able to save hundreds of others?
00:34:03.792,00:34:05.752,I don't have hundreds of patients right now.
00:34:05.794,00:34:08.171,"I have one, and his name is Chuck."
00:34:11.508,00:34:13.385,Blood pressure's steady.
00:34:13.426,00:34:16.847,"Donor vessel to the facial artery, and we're ready to close him up."
00:34:16.889,00:34:19.265,10-0 polypropylene and vascular forceps.
00:34:19.307,00:34:22.143,"Nice work, Dr. Andrews."
00:34:24.312,00:34:27.190,What do we have here?
00:34:27.232,00:34:28.567,Uh...hematoma?
00:34:28.608,00:34:30.652,I can see that.
00:34:30.694,00:34:32.571,"Sponge, stick, and probe."
00:34:37.659,00:34:39.160,It's not my recipient artery.
00:34:39.202,00:34:40.662,Heart rate is dropping.
00:34:40.704,00:34:42.497,"Whatever it is, it's compressing his carotid."
00:34:42.539,00:34:47.168,I can't get deep enough here.
00:34:47.210,00:34:49.212,We move through zone three from the outside.
00:34:49.254,00:34:50.714,Zone three's a minefield.
00:34:50.756,00:34:52.674,"I'm aware, but we need to do this."
00:34:52.716,00:34:54.175,"Whatever you're gonna do, do it quick."
00:34:54.217,00:34:56.386,It's strangling him from the inside.
00:34:59.472,00:35:01.266,Get me Melendez.
00:35:04.394,00:35:06.021,Claire: We made it!
00:35:06.063,00:35:08.356,"Yeah, we're here."
00:35:08.398,00:35:10.108,"Downstairs, coming up."
00:35:10.149,00:35:15.196,"No, no, no. Jared, you're not gonna believe wh-- Yeah?"
00:35:23.080,00:35:25.707,Got it.
00:35:31.254,00:35:35.425,Um...Chuck's been moved to the bottom of the list.
00:35:35.467,00:35:38.386,San Jose Presbyterian are coming to get the liver.
00:35:44.684,00:35:47.938,-Oxygen sats tanking.
00:35:47.980,00:35:51.942,You have to go through the mandible from the inside to probe for the source.
00:35:51.984,00:35:54.152,Loops.
00:35:54.193,00:35:57.781,"We have to be careful in there, or he'll get a stroke."
00:35:57.823,00:36:01.159,We'll just have to be careful then.
00:36:01.200,00:36:05.664,Give Dr. Melendez the mandibular channel retractor and number five bone cutter.
00:36:21.972,00:36:24.265,29 minutes.
00:36:24.307,00:36:25.767,Thank you.
00:36:25.809,00:36:27.560,Got to go.
00:36:27.602,00:36:29.729,His name is Oliver.
00:36:43.160,00:36:45.495,It was a good day.
00:36:47.664,00:36:50.500,We saved a life...
00:36:50.542,00:36:52.585,just not Chuck's.
00:37:18.904,00:37:20.613,It's not your fault.
00:37:20.655,00:37:22.824,I want to believe that.
00:38:12.540,00:38:14.167,Hi!
00:38:14.209,00:38:15.334,Hello.
00:38:15.376,00:38:17.963,Are you a lab guy or something?
00:38:18.004,00:38:19.798,I'm a surgeon.
00:38:19.839,00:38:23.509,May I have my batteries back?
00:38:23.551,00:38:25.262,The ones you borrowed.
00:38:26.888,00:38:29.141,Yeah.
00:38:34.437,00:38:36.189,There you go.
00:38:39.901,00:38:42.237,What's your name?
00:38:42.279,00:38:43.362,I'm Lea.
00:38:43.404,00:38:45.448,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
00:40:15.205,00:40:18.083,You'll stay with me tonight.
00:40:19.918,00:40:23.088,"And tomorrow, we'll figure out the rest."
00:00:01.293,00:00:02.920,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:02.962,00:00:06.298,"I'm your neighbor. I'm in the middle of Uncharted, and I'm dead."
00:00:06.340,00:00:07.466,Can I borrow some triple A's?
00:00:07.508,00:00:08.676,"It's kind of silly, isn't it?"
00:00:08.717,00:00:10.594,Our relationship -- that we're hiding it.
00:00:10.636,00:00:12.763,We don't have a relationship.
00:00:14.264,00:00:16.099,You're late.
00:00:16.141,00:00:17.476,I did nothing wrong.
00:00:16.141,00:00:18.936,The bus -- Yeah.
00:00:18.978,00:00:20.855,So you're treating him like anybody else?
00:00:20.896,00:00:23.398,You have any idea how many patients he's scared the crap out of today?
00:00:23.440,00:00:24.608,So teach him.
00:00:24.650,00:00:26.151,I'm teaching you both that he doesn't belong.
00:00:26.193,00:00:29.571,I hear you got Shaun off scut and back into surgery.
00:00:29.613,00:00:32.533,"You figure you'll give him a little authority, he'll screw something up."
00:00:32.574,00:00:35.243,"Andrews: Either way, if he succeeds, I'm the guy who just backed him."
00:00:35.285,00:00:38.455,"And if he fails, I'm the president."
00:01:14.825,00:01:18.037,Hello.
00:01:18.078,00:01:20.247,"All right, I'm here now."
00:01:21.957,00:01:24.835,We'll just keep looking until you find it.
00:01:24.877,00:01:27.838,Why is the furniture in the middle of the room?
00:01:27.880,00:01:28.923,I know I packed it.
00:01:28.964,00:01:31.842,I made a list.
00:01:31.884,00:01:34.177,"Look, it's checked."
00:01:34.219,00:01:35.679,It's checked.
00:01:46.065,00:01:49.234,Maybe you -- you threw it out with the newspapers you used to pack the dishes?
00:01:49.276,00:01:50.736,I packed with bubble wrap.
00:01:50.778,00:01:52.529,It's safer.
00:01:52.571,00:01:53.739,Of course you did.
00:01:53.781,00:01:56.408,"Shaun, there's a hardware store up the road."
00:01:56.450,00:01:57.576,You can buy a new one.
00:01:57.618,00:01:59.036,I don't want a new screwdriver!
00:01:59.078,00:02:00.370,I want my screwdriver!
00:02:00.412,00:02:01.789,Stop it!
00:02:05.751,00:02:07.544,It's the middle of the -- I'm sorry.
00:02:07.586,00:02:10.130,I just shouldn't have yelled.
00:02:10.171,00:02:12.591,Let's just take a moment.
00:02:15.010,00:02:17.304,"Uh, you know what?"
00:02:17.345,00:02:21.391,"We can use this for now, okay?"
00:02:23.978,00:02:25.104,I can't stay here.
00:02:25.145,00:02:26.105,Of course you can.
00:02:26.187,00:02:27.815,It'll be fine.
00:02:27.856,00:02:31.944,"The...dishwasher doesn't dry, the shower drain has someone else's hair in it."
00:02:31.986,00:02:35.072,And the crisper drawer keeps coming off the track?
00:02:35.114,00:02:37.950,I assume that's what you were fixing.
00:02:39.534,00:02:40.577,I forgot.
00:02:40.619,00:02:41.996,Of course you forgot.
00:02:42.037,00:02:43.080,It's understandable.
00:02:43.122,00:02:45.124,You've been working your ass off.
00:02:45.165,00:02:47.793,You're exhausted.
00:02:47.835,00:02:49.168,There's a super in the building.
00:02:49.210,00:02:51.880,call him anytime.
00:02:51.922,00:02:54.215,Just make a list of the things you need repaired.
00:02:54.257,00:02:55.759,"Later, Shaun. Later."
00:02:55.801,00:02:57.469,"Later, Shaun!"
00:03:12.860,00:03:15.445,"36 years old, 22 weeks pregnant."
00:03:15.487,00:03:18.615,Ultrasound at 16 weeks revealed a tumor on the fetus' tailbone.
00:03:18.657,00:03:20.367,Mom's got antiphospholipid syndrome.
00:03:20.408,00:03:21.451,Makes surgery high risk.
00:03:21.493,00:03:22.870,Also makes pregnancy high risk.
00:03:25.246,00:03:29.459,We need to do an ultrasound and MRI to measure the tumor's growth rate.
00:03:29.501,00:03:34.381,Late bus doesn't explain why you're showing up tired after you just had 12 hours off.
00:03:34.422,00:03:36.133,We're all tired.
00:03:36.175,00:03:37.885,Our last shift was 36 hours.
00:03:37.926,00:03:40.303,I'm not interested in debating the shift schedule with you.
00:03:40.345,00:03:43.724,But I am curious why you always feel the need to defend him.
00:03:43.765,00:03:46.060,"Well, we're all on the same team."
00:03:46.101,00:03:47.144,Yes.
00:03:47.186,00:03:49.270,But you're all quarterbacks.
00:03:49.312,00:03:52.566,"And when training camp is over, there's only gonna be one starter."
00:04:00.281,00:04:04.661,Jared: The crown-rump length of the fetus is 21.5 centimeters.
00:04:05.829,00:04:08.331,The diameter of the tumor is...
00:04:11.418,00:04:13.461,...10.6 centimeters.
00:04:13.503,00:04:15.881,Half the size of the fetus.
00:04:15.923,00:04:17.382,The tumor's grown.
00:04:17.424,00:04:23.138,"It's not cancer, but it is monopolizing the blood supply, which is weakening the fetus' heart."
00:04:23.180,00:04:28.018,"I'm sorry, but there's no chance it would survive long enough to be viable."
00:04:28.060,00:04:30.562,The safest course is to terminate the pregnancy.
00:04:34.274,00:04:39.029,"If we were interested in the safest course, we wouldn't be on our third second opinion."
00:04:39.071,00:04:42.282,"Please, Dr. Melendez, we want whatever will save our baby."
00:04:42.323,00:04:46.078,Dr. Wright told us you've done fetal surgery to remove this type of tumor before.
00:04:46.120,00:04:48.080,"And without the tumor, our baby would be healthy."
00:04:49.706,00:04:54.253,Your antiphospholipid syndrome makes a long surgery extremely dangerous.
00:04:54.294,00:04:57.714,"There's a high chance for blood clots, which could have fatal consequences for you."
00:04:57.756,00:04:59.174,We're willing to take that risk.
00:04:59.216,00:05:02.427,Saving the fetus doesn't do any good if the mother dies in the process.
00:05:02.469,00:05:04.763,I've had three miscarriages.
00:05:04.805,00:05:07.224,"If I have to go through that again, I might as well be dead."
00:05:07.266,00:05:09.017,Barb.
00:05:09.059,00:05:11.145,"No, it's not."
00:05:11.186,00:05:13.396,You're the strongest woman I've ever met.
00:05:13.438,00:05:14.773,We'll get through this.
00:05:14.815,00:05:16.858,We will. And -- And then we'll try again.
00:05:28.620,00:05:31.123,Never contradict me in front of a patient again.
00:05:31.165,00:05:32.582,I didn't.
00:05:32.624,00:05:34.626,I agree with your assessment of the risks.
00:05:36.295,00:05:37.712,Not in front of the patient.
00:05:37.754,00:05:39.589,We're not in front of the patient now.
00:05:53.603,00:05:55.730,Let's get her prepped.
00:05:59.776,00:06:12.247,-- Captions by VITAC -- I want J.L. on anesthesia.
00:06:12.289,00:06:15.292,And let the neo-natal nursing supervisor know that I want to do a full run-through.
00:06:15.334,00:06:18.295,Damn it.
00:06:18.337,00:06:19.963,Yes?
00:06:20.005,00:06:22.549,"Well, we're a little busy up here, too."
00:06:22.590,00:06:25.177,All right.
00:06:25.219,00:06:27.012,Andrews is covering for Lim in the ER.
00:06:27.054,00:06:28.513,He has a patient who needs a boil lanced.
00:06:28.555,00:06:30.724,A plastic surgeon can't lance a boil?
00:06:30.765,00:06:32.976,Plastic surgeons can.
00:06:33.018,00:06:34.644,You and Murphy.
00:06:34.686,00:06:36.521,What?
00:06:36.563,00:06:42.110,"It was our ideas that convinced you to do the fetal surgery, and now you're punishing us with Andrews' scut work?"
00:06:42.152,00:06:43.862,You're not getting punished.
00:06:43.904,00:06:44.863,He is.
00:06:44.905,00:06:46.781,For being late.
00:06:46.823,00:06:48.867,But I don't trust him alone with a patient.
00:06:48.909,00:06:53.372,And since you like to defend him and seem to know how to communicate with him...
00:06:53.412,00:06:54.539,Hurry back.
00:07:00.962,00:07:02.005,Olivia Hartman?
00:07:02.047,00:07:03.006,"Yes, ma'am."
00:07:03.048,00:07:04.966,I mean Doctor.
00:07:05.008,00:07:06.885,You're 18?
00:07:06.927,00:07:07.886,"Yes, ma'am."
00:07:07.928,00:07:08.887,Where's the boil?
00:07:08.929,00:07:11.723,"It's, um -- It's down there."
00:07:11.765,00:07:12.974,Down where?
00:07:13.016,00:07:15.977,Shaun.
00:07:18.397,00:07:20.440,Like I used a bowling ball for a tampon.
00:07:20.481,00:07:23.110,Okay. Boils shouldn't hurt that much.
00:07:23.151,00:07:24.819,Okay if we take a look?
00:07:26.071,00:07:27.155,Okay.
00:07:27.197,00:07:30.742,"If you just scoot down, put your feet in the stirrups..."
00:07:33.620,00:07:35.163,Great.
00:07:36.831,00:07:39.293,The swelling is fairly localized.
00:07:39.334,00:07:44.423,Extreme pain that's out of proportion to the visible injury could mean you have necrotizing flesh-eating bacteria.
00:07:44.464,00:07:45.465,What?!
00:07:47.675,00:07:52.013,I'm gonna use the heparin pre-operatively and a T.E.E. monitor.
00:07:52.055,00:07:53.307,Still not enough.
00:07:53.348,00:07:56.393,The risk of a heart attack or stroke -- Was thoroughly explained.
00:07:56.435,00:07:58.061,The patient still wants the surgery.
00:08:03.024,00:08:07.779,"Yes, saving a fetus' life would be good news for me."
00:08:07.821,00:08:10.282,Any other questions?
00:08:10.324,00:08:11.908,Or insults?
00:08:11.950,00:08:13.827,Relax.
00:08:13.868,00:08:16.121,Of course you want to do the surgery.
00:08:16.163,00:08:18.999,"But you do surgeries like this, some patients are going to die."
00:08:19.040,00:08:24.379,"And then our department's success rate goes down, and then our funding goes down, and then you can't do surgeries like this."
00:08:24.421,00:08:28.008,"So if your judgment is clouded in any way, just -- It's not."
00:08:29.926,00:08:31.303,Okay.
00:08:37.684,00:08:39.560,Aah!
00:08:39.602,00:08:41.355,I'm sorry.
00:08:39.602,00:08:44.983,"I know this hurts, but I really do need to insert a speculum for this part of the exam."
00:08:45.025,00:08:54.493,"If I really have what he says, does that mean you have to cut off my -- No. No, as I said, the abscess is most likely the result of an untreated chlamydia infection."
00:08:54.534,00:08:56.953,"We'll drain the abscess, give you antibiotics."
00:08:56.995,00:08:59.164,You'll be fine.
00:09:00.707,00:09:02.501,I'm -- I'm sorry.
00:09:02.542,00:09:08.006,The inflamed Bartholin gland is causing the ischiocavernosus muscle to spasm and pinch the labial nerve.
00:09:08.048,00:09:09.966,You need to start with a more upward angle.
00:09:10.008,00:09:11.259,Can I try?
00:09:11.301,00:09:12.886,I think it's better if I do this.
00:09:14.888,00:09:16.556,Ow!
00:09:18.892,00:09:20.852,"Yeah, okay. Fine."
00:09:26.900,00:09:29.486,"Can we, uh, call your parents?"
00:09:26.900,00:09:30.904,Let them know -- No.
00:09:30.945,00:09:33.156,I'm 18.
00:09:33.198,00:09:34.991,Even adults need emotional support.
00:09:35.033,00:09:37.035,Someone to drive them home after surgery.
00:09:37.077,00:09:38.703,"Uh, I'm gonna take a taxi."
00:09:38.745,00:09:40.121,I have money.
00:09:40.163,00:09:41.706,There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
00:09:41.748,00:09:46.044,25% of college students contract an STD before graduation.
00:09:46.086,00:09:47.921,I'm not embarrassed.
00:09:47.962,00:09:49.714,And I know all about STDs.
00:09:49.756,00:09:51.799,I get tested every 30 days.
00:09:51.841,00:09:56.263,There's no necrosis on the vaginal wall or cervix.
00:09:56.304,00:09:57.847,You got it in already?
00:09:57.889,00:10:01.017,Yes. It's definitely not flesh-eating bacteria.
00:10:01.059,00:10:02.643,I was wrong.
00:10:02.685,00:10:05.397,You do need surgery to drain the Bartholin gland abscess.
00:10:05.439,00:10:07.982,Why do you get an STD test every 30 days?
00:10:08.024,00:10:10.693,I have to. For work.
00:10:12.612,00:10:14.239,I do porn.
00:10:16.283,00:10:25.375,"The umbilical is 19 inches, which will allow us to remove the fetus via Caesarean and rest it in its mother's lap while I excise the tumor."
00:10:25.417,00:10:29.754,"Now, the hart part will be reinserting the fetus afterwards."
00:10:29.796,00:10:40.515,"We can't overstretch the uterine wall, and we must be certain that every suture is tight enough to handle four more months of kicks and thrown elbows."
00:10:40.557,00:10:41.558,Do you have a minute?
00:10:41.600,00:10:43.560,Can it wait?
00:10:43.602,00:10:44.727,No.
00:10:54.154,00:10:56.030,I don't want to do it.
00:10:58.450,00:10:59.826,Have you talked to your wife?
00:11:02.829,00:11:05.165,You heard her say she'd rather die than lose this baby.
00:11:05.206,00:11:09.043,"I'm sorry, but husbands don't have veto power over their wife's medical decisions."
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.090,A husband can't stop you from operating on his wife.
00:11:14.132,00:11:17.177,But a father can stop you from operating on his child.
00:11:29.230,00:11:32.108,What kind of porn?
00:11:32.150,00:11:34.110,I'm sorry.
00:11:34.152,00:11:37.405,I was too busy doing all the labs and imaging she needed for surgery.
00:11:37.447,00:11:39.199,I forgot to ask for her résumé.
00:11:39.240,00:11:44.579,"I just mean, is she an actual actress, like in stuff with a story, or -- Do they even make porn with stories anymore?"
00:11:44.621,00:11:47.374,Sometimes.
00:11:47.415,00:11:49.584,You watch porn?
00:11:49.626,00:11:51.127,Why wouldn't he?
00:11:51.169,00:11:52.629,-I don't know. He just seems -- -He's a guy.
00:11:52.671,00:11:54.422,All guys watch porn.
00:11:54.464,00:11:55.882,You finished with Andrews' patient?
00:11:55.923,00:11:57.217,No.
00:11:57.258,00:12:00.512,It's a large Bartholin gland abscess that's pressing on her pudendal nerve.
00:12:00.554,00:12:02.721,Which apparently does interest a chief surgeon.
00:12:02.763,00:12:05.392,We're gonna assist Andrews when he drains it first thing in the morning.
00:12:05.433,00:12:07.394,We just thought we'd check with you.
00:12:07.435,00:12:09.270,Go home.
00:12:09.312,00:12:11.690,Not play video games or whatever it is keeping you up.
00:12:11.730,00:12:13.024,I don't think it's video games.
00:12:13.066,00:12:14.733,"You can head out, too."
00:12:14.775,00:12:16.903,But what about -- Fetal surgery's been put on hold.
00:12:16.944,00:12:18.697,What? Why?
00:12:18.737,00:12:20.031,Go home.
00:12:25.245,00:12:29.082,"Once the fetus is removed from the uterus, one could argue that it becomes a child."
00:12:29.123,00:12:30.917,That's ridiculous.
00:12:30.958,00:12:34.462,There are numerous legal precedents -- That guarantee the mother's right to choose.
00:12:34.504,00:12:36.089,It's her body.
00:12:36.130,00:12:38.341,I'm completely comfortable going ahead with this surgery.
00:12:38.383,00:12:39.467,As am I.
00:12:39.509,00:12:41.094,"I never was, and I certainly am not now."
00:12:41.135,00:12:44.931,"Jessica: I'm sorry. Until we're certain there is no liability connected to parental consent, neither am I."
00:12:44.972,00:12:51.104,"Well, the one thing I think we can all agree on is that the mother has the power to do nothing."
00:12:51.145,00:12:55.316,And if she doesn't terminate or have the surgery to remove the tumor...
00:12:55.358,00:12:59.404,A fetus with a massive tumor will die inside a patient with APS.
00:12:59.446,00:13:01.155,"Then the mother would die, too, right?"
00:13:01.197,00:13:03.617,"So we do nothing, and they both die."
00:13:03.658,00:13:10.290,"Or we can do something that's legally and ethically complicated, and maybe they both live."
00:13:25.012,00:13:26.389,The board has approved the surgery.
00:13:27.848,00:13:29.309,Thank you.
00:13:29.350,00:13:32.145,"Barb, please -- Mark, stop."
00:13:35.523,00:13:37.150,If you loved me...
00:13:37.191,00:13:38.151,No.
00:13:38.192,00:13:40.236,"No, do not say that."
00:13:40.278,00:13:44.407,If you really loved me -- I'm trying to protect you because I love you.
00:13:44.449,00:13:47.619,I don't need your protection.
00:13:49.870,00:13:52.415,I need your support.
00:13:52.457,00:13:55.042,We'll start prepping you first thing in the morning.
00:13:55.084,00:13:57.170,Try and get some sleep.
00:13:57.211,00:13:59.046,Thank you.
00:14:11.309,00:14:13.227,I still can't believe it.
00:14:16.356,00:14:19.651,That 18-year-old college students do porn?
00:14:19.693,00:14:21.569,She's just not the type.
00:14:21.611,00:14:22.737,How do you know what type she is?
00:14:22.779,00:14:23.904,You just met her.
00:14:23.946,00:14:26.783,Did one medical history and pelvic exam.
00:14:28.576,00:14:30.911,What?
00:14:30.953,00:14:31.996,Nothing.
00:14:32.038,00:14:33.540,"No, go ahead."
00:14:33.581,00:14:35.166,Tell me all the reasons why I'm wrong.
00:14:38.252,00:14:43.049,I volunteered at a shelter for runaway teens when I was at high school.
00:14:43.090,00:14:45.176,Got to know a lot of sex workers.
00:14:45.218,00:14:52.892,"They're not all the same, but they do have the same..."
00:14:52.933,00:14:55.102,armor.
00:14:56.145,00:14:58.064,I don't believe it.
00:14:58.105,00:14:59.982,You think I'm lying?
00:15:00.024,00:15:04.696,"No, I think you just opened up to me, actually shared something personal."
00:15:04.738,00:15:06.823,high-school community service.
00:15:06.865,00:15:07.990,It's not a big deal.
00:15:08.032,00:15:09.283,"Oh, no, it's a big deal."
00:15:09.325,00:15:10.827,This is huge.
00:15:10.869,00:15:12.787,I am peeling the onion.
00:15:12.829,00:15:16.708,"Actually, it's more like hacking through a coconut with a dull machete, but -- Dull is right."
00:15:16.750,00:15:18.918,Very dull.
00:15:18.959,00:15:21.421,"It feels good, doesn't it?"
00:15:21.462,00:15:23.047,You should do it more often.
00:15:23.089,00:15:31.639,How about you stop worrying about what I won't do and just enjoy what I will?
00:15:39.647,00:15:43.777,Do you think she's of sound mind?
00:15:43.818,00:15:46.780,You really want to talk about work right now?
00:15:46.821,00:15:48.948,She's basically threatening to commit suicide.
00:15:48.989,00:15:50.950,She's not suicidal.
00:15:50.991,00:15:53.787,She's -- She's just desperate to have a child.
00:15:53.828,00:15:55.121,This is probably her last chance.
00:15:55.162,00:15:57.039,She could adopt.
00:15:57.081,00:15:59.876,It's not the same.
00:15:59.918,00:16:01.461,You don't think there's a difference?
00:16:01.502,00:16:02.837,"No, I don't."
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.757,Carrying a fetus in your body for nine months.
00:16:05.799,00:16:08.342,You don't think that creates a unique relationship?
00:16:08.384,00:16:10.678,I think every relationship is unique.
00:16:10.720,00:16:12.764,"Yeah, of course."
00:16:12.806,00:16:14.098,What are you saying?
00:16:14.140,00:16:16.517,I just think it's selfish.
00:16:16.559,00:16:24.358,"I mean, for her to go through so much, to put your husband through so much, just so you can have a certain experience when there are other ways."
00:16:24.400,00:16:26.193,"Yeah, okay."
00:16:26.235,00:16:28.988,"But...you want children, though, right?"
00:16:29.029,00:16:30.490,We've talked about this before.
00:16:30.531,00:16:32.575,"Yes, I-I want children."
00:16:34.076,00:16:35.536,"Like, from you getting pregnant."
00:16:35.578,00:16:37.288,Yes.
00:16:38.915,00:16:40.792,But what if that doesn't happen?
00:16:40.834,00:16:46.673,What if I couldn't get pregnant or if I decided that I didn't want to?
00:16:46.714,00:16:48.466,That I wanted to adopt instead?
00:16:48.508,00:16:51.010,Is there something you're not telling me?
00:16:51.051,00:16:52.595,"Actually, there is."
00:16:53.888,00:16:57.433,"When we're in meetings together, don't ever call my ideas ridiculous."
00:16:57.475,00:16:58.977,"Come on, I'm being serious."
00:16:59.018,00:17:00.770,So am I.
00:17:02.689,00:17:04.106,Okay.
00:17:04.148,00:17:05.274,You're right.
00:17:05.316,00:17:06.359,It won't happen again.
00:17:29.841,00:17:30.967,"Steve: Geez, you scared me."
00:17:31.009,00:17:32.886,What're you reading?
00:17:32.927,00:17:34.387,Can I read it?
00:17:34.428,00:17:36.263,Why?
00:17:36.305,00:17:37.264,Why?
00:17:37.306,00:17:39.058,Because.
00:17:39.099,00:17:42.311,Why?
00:17:42.353,00:17:45.314,Because there's nothing to read.
00:17:45.356,00:17:46.941,Just pictures.
00:17:46.983,00:17:48.150,Where'd you get this?
00:17:48.192,00:17:49.736,Colleen Myers.
00:17:49.777,00:17:53.573,"Her dad has so many in his closet, he doesn't even notice when she takes a few."
00:17:53.614,00:17:55.491,She's pretty.
00:17:55.533,00:17:57.076,She sure is.
00:17:58.411,00:18:00.079,It's bedtime.
00:18:00.120,00:18:01.247,That means lights out.
00:18:18.639,00:18:20.182,I missed my stop.
00:18:20.224,00:18:22.518,I missed my stop!
00:18:22.560,00:18:24.270,Lynwood Place!
00:18:24.311,00:18:26.272,I need to get off at Lynwood Place.
00:18:26.313,00:18:30.902,"Well, then you should've been paying attention when I stopped at Lynwood Place."
00:18:30.944,00:18:34.447,"Next stop's gonna be even further away, so if I were you..."
00:19:22.036,00:19:23.370,Lea: Shaun?
00:19:23.412,00:19:25.414,Are you okay?
00:19:25.456,00:19:26.749,Yes.
00:19:26.791,00:19:28.668,Are you waiting for someone?
00:19:28.709,00:19:30.503,No.
00:19:34.007,00:19:36.717,"Lea: I'm horrible at directions, too."
00:19:36.759,00:19:43.766,"Every time I exit a BART station, I walk like three blocks before I realize I'm going the wrong direction."
00:19:43.808,00:19:46.519,You're lucky I actually made it to the gym.
00:19:46.560,00:19:51.149,"I like to go when it's not crowded, but it's so hard to motivate after work."
00:19:51.190,00:19:55.361,Half the time I end up not -- You stink.
00:19:55.402,00:19:57.030,I know.
00:19:57.071,00:19:59.281,But I can't shower there.
00:19:59.323,00:20:01.993,I'm terrified of foot fungus.
00:20:02.035,00:20:06.039,"Hey, you know, as long as we're tossing out truth grenades, you suck at being a neighbor."
00:20:06.080,00:20:12.628,"First, you take back your batteries, and then you wake me up in the middle of the night stomping around and banging on pipes."
00:20:12.670,00:20:13.921,What the hell's up with that?
00:20:13.963,00:20:15.882,My sink drips.
00:20:15.923,00:20:17.633,"I couldn't sleep, so I tried to fix it."
00:20:17.675,00:20:20.803,"Then I couldn't find my screwdriver, which made me anxious."
00:20:20.845,00:20:24.015,You kept me up because you were anxious about a screwdriver?
00:20:24.057,00:20:26.600,Yes.
00:20:26.642,00:20:29.812,You're funny.
00:20:29.854,00:20:32.565,I stink.
00:20:35.860,00:20:38.362,It's the total opposite of most guys.
00:20:38.404,00:20:41.365,It's nice.
00:20:50.583,00:20:52.752,Good night.
00:20:52.793,00:20:55.337,And don't go fixing any faucets tonight.
00:20:55.379,00:20:56.505,That's Armen's job.
00:21:16.109,00:21:19.319,This is a list of repairs I need for my apartment.
00:21:19.361,00:21:21.114,Number 33.
00:21:21.155,00:21:22.990,What the hell is your problem?
00:21:23.032,00:21:24.909,Sorry. Hello.
00:21:24.951,00:21:27.620,My name is Shaun Murphy.
00:21:27.661,00:21:32.083,"No, it's not nice to meet me at 12:40 a.m."
00:21:32.125,00:21:33.834,Yes.
00:21:33.876,00:21:37.504,Dr. Glassman said I can call you any time I need something fixed.
00:21:37.546,00:21:38.923,Who the hell is Dr. Glassman?
00:21:38.965,00:21:41.759,He's the president at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital.
00:21:41.801,00:21:43.302,I'm a surgical resident there.
00:21:43.343,00:21:46.388,"Well, I don't care if you're St. Bonaventure himself."
00:21:46.430,00:21:50.101,"Unless it's a fire or flood, I only work 9:00 to 5:00."
00:21:50.143,00:21:51.894,"Mm, I'll..."
00:21:51.936,00:21:53.980,try and come back tomorrow between those times.
00:21:54.021,00:21:57.691,You already woke me up.
00:22:02.989,00:22:06.325,I should've known you would take what I said literally.
00:22:06.366,00:22:07.910,It's okay.
00:22:07.952,00:22:10.288,"Actually, you know what, Shaun?"
00:22:10.329,00:22:11.664,It's not my fault.
00:22:11.705,00:22:14.083,It's your responsibility.
00:22:14.125,00:22:16.127,You should be able to use your common sense.
00:22:16.169,00:22:19.797,"When somebody says something, you should figure out what they really mean."
00:22:19.839,00:22:25.678,"And when things don't go exactly how you expected them, navigate that."
00:22:30.724,00:22:34.520,a Personal Support Worker.
00:22:34.561,00:22:36.105,Think of it like a home health aide.
00:22:36.147,00:22:37.273,"No, thank you."
00:22:37.315,00:22:38.691,I can take care of myself.
00:22:38.732,00:22:40.693,Everybody needs a little help now and then.
00:22:40.734,00:22:43.321,I-I'm thinking of asking them to give me one.
00:22:43.361,00:22:45.323,I've lived by myself a long time.
00:22:45.363,00:22:47.533,"In Casper, Wyoming."
00:22:47.574,00:22:49.202,Everybody looked out for you in Casper.
00:22:49.243,00:22:50.870,Everybody looks out for everybody in Casper.
00:22:50.911,00:22:52.705,This is San Jose.
00:22:52.746,00:22:56.834,And residency is a whole lot more demanding than medical -- I don't need an aide.
00:22:56.876,00:22:57.877,"We're just talking, Shaun."
00:23:00.087,00:23:02.631,Okay.
00:23:02.673,00:23:05.051,Okay.
00:23:05.092,00:23:07.845,We'll table it for some other time.
00:23:09.471,00:23:12.558,"Let's enjoy our breakfast, okay?"
00:23:20.566,00:23:23.069,Mr. Allen?
00:23:23.110,00:23:25.196,I'm trying to convince her to save herself.
00:23:25.238,00:23:27.156,I don't want to roll the dice with my wife's life.
00:23:27.198,00:23:29.200,But she does.
00:23:29.242,00:23:33.329,"We're gonna start prepping her now, and she goes into the O.R."
00:23:33.371,00:23:35.039,I understand why she's desperate.
00:23:35.081,00:23:37.917,But not why you are.
00:23:37.958,00:23:40.002,"If she dies, it's your fault."
00:23:40.044,00:23:42.213,And what if she lives?
00:23:43.964,00:23:48.719,"You're gonna have a wife and child who need you, and you keep driving her out of your life."
00:23:48.761,00:23:50.679,I'm not desperate.
00:23:50.721,00:23:52.639,I'm confident.
00:23:52.681,00:23:54.516,Which should make you feel better.
00:24:05.152,00:24:06.779,Retraction.
00:24:06.820,00:24:11.158,"I'll make the incision, and then I want you to insert the Word catheter."
00:24:11.200,00:24:13.451,"Good job on the pelvic exam, Dr. Murphy."
00:24:13.493,00:24:15.204,"With all this swelling, it couldn't have been easy."
00:24:15.246,00:24:16.205,Thank you.
00:24:16.247,00:24:17.497,How do you know who...
00:24:17.539,00:24:19.125,"Oh, I have my ways."
00:24:19.166,00:24:20.126,Like Santa.
00:24:20.167,00:24:21.543,I told him.
00:24:21.585,00:24:22.669,No presents for you.
00:24:22.711,00:24:23.796,Insert the drain.
00:24:26.799,00:24:28.217,But I'm curious.
00:24:28.259,00:24:33.806,How could a guy who can't even shake a co-worker's hand be comfortable doing a pelvic exam?
00:24:33.847,00:24:36.016,People squeeze too hard.
00:24:36.058,00:24:39.812,Send this to the lab for culture.
00:24:39.853,00:24:42.522,"So, I'm guessing you're not that into hugs."
00:24:42.564,00:24:44.900,I don't like to be squeezed.
00:24:44.942,00:24:46.902,"Well, what if it's somebody you like?"
00:24:46.944,00:24:48.486,Or somebody you love?
00:24:48.528,00:24:50.406,Have you ever had a girlfriend?
00:24:52.325,00:24:54.952,I almost kissed a girl.
00:24:54.994,00:24:58.872,"Well, you know what they say -- If at first you don't succeed..."
00:24:58.914,00:25:01.208,Are you trying to mock me or encourage me?
00:25:01.250,00:25:06.255,I'm trying to get to know you so I know when I should mock and when I should encourage.
00:25:06.297,00:25:09.216,When's the right time to mock you?
00:25:15.181,00:25:17.141,Press harder on that abscess.
00:25:17.183,00:25:18.434,It should have drained by now.
00:25:18.476,00:25:20.186,Something's wrong.
00:25:20.227,00:25:23.272,"The gland's evacuated, but the swelling's not going down."
00:25:23.314,00:25:24.731,Heart rate and BP are stable.
00:25:24.773,00:25:28.402,"Can I get a little more light, please?"
00:25:28.444,00:25:30.112,Damn.
00:25:30.154,00:25:33.824,The swelling isn't going down because there's a mass beneath the abscess.
00:25:33.866,00:25:37.370,And it's not just pressing on the pudendal nerve -- It's totally engulfed it.
00:25:37.411,00:25:38.704,That's bad.
00:25:38.745,00:25:39.746,Very bad.
00:25:48.714,00:25:52.510,-You're done already?
00:25:52.550,00:25:55.304,We were able to drain the abscess.
00:25:55.346,00:25:57.348,I already feel better.
00:25:57.390,00:25:59.058,Shaun: That's only because of the pain meds.
00:25:59.099,00:26:02.311,The reason the pain was so severe was because it wasn't just an abscess.
00:26:02.353,00:26:04.938,There's perineal myoma underneath.
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.690,What's that?
00:26:06.732,00:26:09.193,A fibroid tumor.
00:26:09.235,00:26:13.364,"It's not cancerous, but it is wrapped around the nerve."
00:26:18.576,00:26:22.415,You'll lose all feeling in your genitals.
00:26:22.456,00:26:24.250,I'm so sorry.
00:26:24.291,00:26:27.169,I knew it.
00:26:29.922,00:26:31.173,God's punishing me.
00:26:32.883,00:26:35.344,This is just a random growth -- You're religious?
00:26:35.386,00:26:36.762,Yes.
00:26:36.803,00:26:40.015,Or at least I used to be.
00:26:41.641,00:26:44.353,I haven't thought about God in a really long time.
00:26:44.395,00:26:47.189,But being in here...
00:26:47.231,00:26:49.400,You sure you don't want us to call your parents?
00:26:49.442,00:26:54.238,No. I couldn't bear to see the look on their faces.
00:26:54.280,00:26:55.906,Especially my dad's.
00:26:55.948,00:26:59.452,"Well, that's what parents are for."
00:26:59.493,00:27:01.703,So you don't have to do these things alone.
00:27:01.745,00:27:05.583,Could you tell your father you're a whore?
00:27:05.623,00:27:08.419,You made a mistake.
00:27:08.461,00:27:09.920,That is all.
00:27:15.884,00:27:18.137,Patient vitals?
00:27:18.178,00:27:19.597,Fetus?
00:27:19.637,00:27:20.973,Okay.
00:27:21.014,00:27:23.142,Is everybody ready?
00:27:36.947,00:27:38.073,Retractor.
00:27:52.171,00:27:54.047,Okay.
00:27:54.089,00:27:55.799,Cutting into the uterus.
00:28:00.762,00:28:02.764,T.E.E. is showing anterior wall hypokinesis.
00:28:02.806,00:28:04.642,Systolic pressure 90.
00:28:04.682,00:28:05.892,I.V. function is decreasing.
00:28:05.934,00:28:06.977,She's having a heart attack.
00:28:07.019,00:28:08.354,I need you to close the incision.
00:28:08.395,00:28:09.980,-On it. Needle driver.
00:28:10.022,00:28:11.815,I'm gonna prep her for a balloon pump.
00:28:14.360,00:28:17.237,Melendez: Barbara?
00:28:17.279,00:28:19.490,There was a complication during surgery.
00:28:19.532,00:28:21.908,A blood clot blocked an artery in your heart.
00:28:21.950,00:28:24.077,We were able to catch it in time.
00:28:24.119,00:28:25.078,And my baby?
00:28:25.120,00:28:27.581,The fetus is stable.
00:28:27.623,00:28:30.917,The M.I. happened before we opened the uterus.
00:28:30.959,00:28:32.919,"So, we're right back where we started?"
00:28:32.961,00:28:35.422,You just had a heart attack.
00:28:35.464,00:28:36.507,I don't care.
00:28:36.549,00:28:38.175,There is no other option now.
00:28:38.217,00:28:43.096,"If we don't terminate and the fetus dies in utero, the resulting clots will overwhelm your heart and brain."
00:28:43.138,00:28:45.265,Which is exactly why we need to try again.
00:28:45.307,00:28:48.227,What're you talking about?
00:28:48.268,00:28:50.688,You need to remove the tumor.
00:28:53.482,00:28:56.026,You begged me not to do the surgery before.
00:28:56.068,00:28:57.777,I thought I could talk her out of it then.
00:28:57.819,00:29:00.489,Now I know I can't.
00:29:00.531,00:29:02.533,"Either you do it, or she dies."
00:29:06.203,00:29:13.793,"Before, if we got sued, we'd at least have one of them on our side, but now, with them both aligned -- Can they sue us for not operating?"
00:29:13.835,00:29:15.879,They could argue that we abandoned care.
00:29:15.921,00:29:17.297,Melendez: We're still offering care.
00:29:17.339,00:29:18.507,Just not the care that they want.
00:29:18.549,00:29:20.759,Which is your fault.
00:29:20.800,00:29:24.846,"If you hadn't offered her hope to begin with, we might have been able to reason with her."
00:29:24.888,00:29:27.057,How's the pain around the incision?
00:29:27.099,00:29:28.726,5 out of 10.
00:29:28.767,00:29:30.060,I'll up the dosage.
00:29:30.102,00:29:31.395,Any chest pain?
00:29:31.437,00:29:33.480,No.
00:29:34.523,00:29:36.692,Good.
00:29:41.863,00:29:43.949,"If she doesn't want to terminate, there's nothing we can do."
00:29:43.990,00:29:45.284,So we just send her home to die?
00:29:45.325,00:29:46.410,It is her decision.
00:29:46.452,00:29:48.662,We could tell her we were going ahead with the fetal surgery.
00:29:48.704,00:29:51.164,But once she's under -- I'm gonna pretend you never said that.
00:29:51.206,00:29:54.293,If it's the only chance to save her life -- This is exactly what I'm talking about.
00:29:54.334,00:29:57.588,You wouldn't lie to convince a suicidal person to climb down off the ledge?
00:29:57.630,00:30:01.592,"Knowingly lying to a patient about a major medical surgery -- Okay, okay! Hey!"
00:30:01.634,00:30:03.677,Lying to a patient is one thing.
00:30:03.719,00:30:07.097,Performing surgery without their consent -- It's unethical and illegal.
00:30:07.139,00:30:08.181,And insane.
00:30:08.223,00:30:09.600,Melendez: I just...
00:30:09.642,00:30:11.017,I don't want to do this.
00:30:16.732,00:30:18.358,It's not our only option.
00:30:18.400,00:30:20.944,You want me to attempt the fetal surgery again?
00:30:20.986,00:30:22.529,If it's the only way to save her life.
00:30:22.571,00:30:24.364,"The first time, it was the only way to save her life."
00:30:24.406,00:30:28.868,But a second heart attack one day after the first will kill her.
00:30:28.910,00:30:34.416,"I am so sorry to interrupt, I have an idea."
00:30:41.256,00:30:45.135,We'll stop your heart and put you on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery.
00:30:45.177,00:30:48.054,You can't have a heart attack if your heart's not beating to begin with.
00:30:48.096,00:30:50.098,It takes the most significant danger off the table.
00:30:50.140,00:30:52.351,"But aren't the clots a danger to her brain, as well?"
00:30:52.392,00:30:57.063,"This doesn't completely eliminate every risk, but it does reduce the biggest one."
00:30:59.191,00:31:00.567,Thank you.
00:31:00.609,00:31:03.654,We'll do it first thing in the morning.
00:31:33.642,00:31:36.102,You fixed my sink!
00:31:36.144,00:31:37.688,Do you know how to tell time?
00:31:37.730,00:31:39.231,You fixed my sink!
00:31:39.272,00:31:41.149,You're welcome.
00:31:41.191,00:31:43.485,It was not on the list!
00:31:43.527,00:31:45.320,The faucet.
00:31:45.362,00:31:47.489,You weren't supposed to touch it.
00:31:47.531,00:31:56.373,"So after I fix everything you woke me up for, then I go out of my way to fix something el-- It was not on the list because I'd already fixed it."
00:31:56.415,00:31:57.999,"Well, you fixed it wrong."
00:31:58.041,00:31:59.209,Because it was still dripping.
00:31:59.251,00:32:00.460,I need it to drip.
00:32:00.502,00:32:02.713,At the same rate as my sink in Casper.
00:32:02.755,00:32:03.963,It was too slow before.
00:32:04.005,00:32:05.632,Now I have to fix it all over again.
00:32:05.674,00:32:07.509,It's not fair.
00:32:09.094,00:32:13.139,If you don't like your faucet or anything else in your apartment? Move.
00:32:13.181,00:32:19.479,"If you knock on this door again after 5:00 p.m., I'm gonna knock your teeth out."
00:34:32.237,00:34:34.072,-Nerves are like pipes!
00:34:32.237,00:34:38.284,"-Shaun, th-- this -- We need to sever the pudendal nerve to excise the myoma, but if we reconnect the ends..."
00:34:38.326,00:34:40.412,The tumor is 4 centimeters in diameter.
00:34:40.453,00:34:43.623,"That's way too wide of a gap to reconnect the ends, and nerves don't stretch."
00:34:43.665,00:34:45.042,We don't need to stretch it.
00:34:45.083,00:34:51.256,We can connect the distal end of the pudendal nerve to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh.
00:34:53.258,00:34:56.302,Would you rather lose feeling in your thigh or genitals?
00:34:56.344,00:34:58.597,"Thigh, definitely."
00:34:58.638,00:35:01.641,Is he right?
00:35:01.683,00:35:02.976,Can we do that?
00:35:03.018,00:35:11.359,"It probably would've been better to discuss this prior to meeting with the patient, but, yes, I think it could work."
00:35:16.073,00:35:18.575,Cut the suture.
00:35:21.578,00:35:24.998,Grafted nerve's in place.
00:35:35.050,00:35:37.844,Conduction electrodes are in position.
00:35:37.886,00:35:38.887,Send a pulse.
00:35:43.224,00:35:44.183,Again.
00:35:45.393,00:35:47.104,Again.
00:35:48.187,00:35:49.439,Again.
00:35:49.481,00:35:50.607,Your idea worked.
00:35:50.649,00:35:51.608,Good job. Both of you.
00:35:51.650,00:35:54.193,Thanks.
00:35:54.235,00:36:00.366,"I'm guessing Melendez doesn't let you know this enough, but you both are doing a great job."
00:36:00.408,00:36:06.748,"And if either of you needs anything, even just to talk, my door's always open."
00:36:06.790,00:36:08.249,4-0 Vicryl.
00:36:13.130,00:36:15.090,Jared: She's on bypass.
00:36:16.215,00:36:17.759,Melendez: Cross clamping the aorta.
00:36:23.974,00:36:25.350,You ready?
00:36:26.935,00:36:27.936,Flush the heart.
00:36:27.978,00:36:28.937,Flushing.
00:36:37.236,00:36:39.614,Let's prep her for C-section.
00:36:50.542,00:36:53.086,The operation went perfectly.
00:36:53.128,00:36:55.881,But I don't feel anything down there.
00:36:55.922,00:37:01.011,"You're still on the meds, so it's gonna -- It's going to take six months to a year to regain complete sensation."
00:37:01.053,00:37:04.097,It'll take a while for your brain to figure out what we did.
00:37:04.139,00:37:06.474,But the grafted nerve is fully conducting.
00:37:06.516,00:37:07.934,You're gonna be fine.
00:37:07.976,00:37:09.144,Thank you.
00:37:09.186,00:37:11.771,Can you do me a favor?
00:37:11.813,00:37:12.981,Sure.
00:37:15.150,00:37:16.484,Call my parents.
00:37:16.526,00:37:18.778,Absolutely.
00:37:24.784,00:37:26.619,Knife.
00:37:52.520,00:37:54.147,Bovie.
00:38:07.911,00:38:09.495,How're we on bypass?
00:38:13.792,00:38:15.501,"Dr. Kalu, you still with us?"
00:38:15.543,00:38:16.669,Yeah.
00:38:16.711,00:38:18.964,"Oh. Um, central venous pressure's good."
00:38:19.005,00:38:20.757,Bypass oxygen tension's 200.
00:38:20.799,00:38:23.218,Good.
00:38:23.260,00:38:25.428,Gonna put this baby back where it belongs.
00:38:25.470,00:38:27.222,Baby?
00:38:28.389,00:38:30.558,That's the first time you didn't call it a fetus.
00:38:30.600,00:38:33.394,Just an expression.
00:38:45.073,00:38:46.241,I told you.
00:38:46.283,00:38:48.493,"Yes, you did."
00:38:48.534,00:38:51.997,You're gonna need to stay in bed for the next four months...
00:38:52.038,00:38:54.415,but both you and your son's prognosis is excellent.
00:38:54.457,00:38:56.459,Hey.
00:38:56.501,00:38:58.878,We wanted it to be a surprise.
00:38:58.920,00:39:01.047,Oops.
00:39:01.089,00:39:04.134,Rookie mistake.
00:39:06.678,00:39:07.929,Yes!
00:39:07.971,00:39:10.556,We are definitely celebrating tonight.
00:39:10.598,00:39:12.725,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:39:12.767,00:39:14.435,You are coming with us.
00:39:14.477,00:39:15.895,Where are you going?
00:39:15.937,00:39:17.689,We're gonna drink.
00:39:17.730,00:39:19.316,Don't be an idiot.
00:39:19.398,00:39:20.900,I just meant...
00:39:20.942,00:39:22.443,"Come on, mate."
00:39:22.485,00:39:25.446,You just saved an 18-year-old girl's sex life.
00:39:25.488,00:39:26.781,And I saved two lives.
00:39:26.823,00:39:28.283,We are drinking.
00:39:30.869,00:39:31.995,"Come on, Shaun."
00:39:34.247,00:39:36.457,Okay.
00:39:36.499,00:39:38.584,Cool.
00:39:52.098,00:39:53.599,All right.
00:39:53.641,00:39:56.102,I have to go home now.
00:39:56.144,00:39:57.854,It'll be okay.
00:39:57.896,00:39:59.272,We won't stay long.
00:40:25.673,00:40:28.551,"Hi, Shaun."
00:40:28.593,00:40:30.678,"Hi, Colleen."
00:40:30.720,00:40:33.723,I heard Steve showed you my dad's magazine.
00:40:33.765,00:40:35.392,Did you like it?
00:40:38.186,00:40:40.479,Don't worry.
00:40:42.774,00:40:45.277,It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
00:40:45.318,00:40:48.696,All guys like that kind of stuff.
00:40:48.738,00:40:52.700,You want to know a secret about me?
00:40:52.742,00:40:54.119,I think you're really cute.
00:40:54.160,00:40:57.455,You smell like bubble gum.
00:40:57.496,00:40:59.624,I know.
00:41:02.668,00:41:04.003,Come here.
00:41:05.588,00:41:08.258,"Come here, silly."
00:41:10.718,00:41:12.053,Do you think I'm pretty?
00:41:14.013,00:41:15.640,"I like you, too."
00:41:19.727,00:41:21.938,I'll show you mine if you show me yours.
00:41:24.899,00:41:27.819,Come on.
00:41:27.860,00:41:29.695,You must be curious.
00:41:29.737,00:41:33.325,Can I have a kiss?
00:41:33.366,00:41:35.576,I want to know what it feels like.
00:41:35.618,00:41:38.288,I'll give you a kiss...
00:41:39.538,00:41:41.040,Show you what?
00:41:41.082,00:41:43.042,You know.
00:41:43.084,00:41:44.085,No.
00:41:44.127,00:41:46.004,"Come on, Shaun."
00:41:46.045,00:41:48.340,No. I gotta go.
00:41:50.258,00:41:52.302,"Oh, my God. I can't believe you were about to pull it out."
00:41:52.344,00:41:53.552,"No, I wasn't!"
00:41:53.594,00:41:56.514,And like I'd ever kiss a creepy weirdo like you.
00:41:56.555,00:41:59.058,Leave him alone!
00:42:04.230,00:42:07.317,"All right, guys, a toast."
00:42:07.359,00:42:09.361,'Cause we rock.
00:42:09.402,00:42:10.487,Nothing else need be said.
00:42:10.528,00:42:13.114,Cheers.
00:00:01.209,00:00:02.878,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:02.920,00:00:06.590,Ethan: How hard can it be to just act like a normal human being?!
00:00:06.632,00:00:07.842,No!
00:00:07.883,00:00:09.468,Stop petting that stupid rabbit!
00:00:09.510,00:00:11.595,We're never going home again.
00:00:11.637,00:00:13.180,"We have each other, and that's all we need."
00:00:13.221,00:00:16.684,Shaun: My brother went to heaven in front of my eyes.
00:00:18.435,00:00:20.103,"Steve: Never forget, you're the smart one."
00:00:20.145,00:00:22.230,"And I'm proud of you, Shaun."
00:00:27.736,00:00:29.029,Kevin: Dad?
00:00:34.242,00:00:36.036,Hey!
00:00:37.329,00:00:38.205,"I missed you, too!"
00:00:38.246,00:00:40.374,"Oh, Penny, come."
00:00:40.415,00:00:42.292,Stay.
00:00:42.334,00:00:44.545,"Hey, Dad."
00:00:44.586,00:00:46.672,Sorry it's so early.
00:00:46.714,00:00:48.632,"Actually, you're a bit late."
00:00:48.674,00:00:49.884,Five weeks.
00:00:49.925,00:00:53.052,I know.
00:00:53.094,00:00:57.140,I'm sorry.
00:00:57.182,00:00:59.018,But h-how was it?
00:00:59.059,00:01:01.269,It was your mother's funeral.
00:01:04.481,00:01:16.785,"Dad, I'm -- Okay."
00:01:16.827,00:01:19.038,"Well, um, you have my cell number."
00:01:19.079,00:01:21.957,It only works if you answer it.
00:01:29.048,00:01:30.507,Dad?
00:01:30.549,00:01:32.091,Dad?!
00:01:32.133,00:01:33.677,Dad!
00:01:33.719,00:01:35.721,"Hey, hey!"
00:01:35.763,00:01:37.431,You okay?
00:01:37.472,00:01:38.599,No? Okay.
00:01:38.640,00:01:41.518,"Hold on, I'm gonna call for help, okay?"
00:01:41.560,00:01:42.978,911? My dad collapsed!
00:01:43.020,00:01:44.605,"He can't -- he can't breathe, please hurry!"
00:01:44.646,00:01:45.773,"Just hold on, Dad!"
00:01:53.321,00:01:54.949,"Good morning, everyone!"
00:01:54.990,00:01:56.784,Right on time.
00:01:54.990,00:01:59.578,"What, did you sleep here or use a teleportation device?"
00:01:59.620,00:02:02.081,I used a teleportation device.
00:02:03.832,00:02:08.837,"Nonsensical questions usually imply sarcasm, which I've found people often answer sarcastically."
00:02:08.879,00:02:10.005,Good one.
00:02:10.047,00:02:17.054,"Trauma wants a consult on a 66-year-old male who collapsed from severe anaphylaxis, complicated by respiratory arrest."
00:02:17.096,00:02:18.597,His son just got back from Thailand.
00:02:18.639,00:02:20.724,"Almost immediately, the father had his allergic reaction."
00:02:28.065,00:02:30.442,Why are we doing a surgical consult on an allergy?
00:02:30.484,00:02:31.986,"Well, we're not."
00:02:30.484,00:02:34.195,We're doing a consult on the excruciating abdominal pain he now has.
00:02:37.365,00:02:39.827,As you may have heard.
00:02:39.868,00:02:43.413,"Mr. Wilks, hi, I'm Dr. Neil Melendez."
00:02:43.455,00:02:45.248,Heard you had some abdominal pain.
00:03:09.898,00:03:23.370,-- Captions by VITAC -- The guy was in some serious pain -- 10 milligrams of morphine worth.
00:03:23.411,00:03:27.041,"Test results show elevated lipase, amylase, pancreatic enzymes."
00:03:27.082,00:03:28.291,Pancreas is enlarged.
00:03:28.333,00:03:30.669,"Could be pancreatitis, maybe alcohol-induced."
00:03:30.711,00:03:33.380,The son said he smelled alcohol on his father at 6:00 in the morning.
00:03:33.421,00:03:37.134,And anaphylaxis has been known to precipitate attacks of pancreatitis.
00:03:37.176,00:03:38.593,"Guess that's it, then."
00:03:40.679,00:03:42.597,Meaning you totally disagree.
00:03:42.639,00:03:46.601,Not everyone who starts their day off with a Mimosa fries their pancreas.
00:03:46.643,00:03:48.062,Your eyesight must a hell of a lot better than mine.
00:03:54.526,00:03:56.987,We'll order an abdominal CT and take a better look.
00:03:57.029,00:03:58.530,There you go.
00:04:00.157,00:04:03.368,"It's a severe fracture, but I don't think you'll need pins."
00:04:03.410,00:04:05.245,Young bones tend to heal very well.
00:04:05.286,00:04:09.083,Young Bones? Isn't that a Star Trek: Origins graphic novel?
00:04:11.710,00:04:14.254,I'm not sure.
00:04:14.295,00:04:15.672,"No, that was a joke."
00:04:15.714,00:04:17.049,Where are your parents?
00:04:17.091,00:04:18.884,They're coming.
00:04:17.091,00:04:20.677,"They both work in the city, so it's a long drive for them."
00:04:20.719,00:04:24.056,"I was on a school field trip, and I tripped over my own feet."
00:04:24.098,00:04:26.850,"Of course, it was right in front of Shelby Lomar."
00:04:26.892,00:04:30.520,"At least it was pretty gross, so I got some sympathy points for that."
00:04:33.648,00:04:36.944,I would expect this to have been caused by a more serious accident.
00:04:36.985,00:04:38.112,"Nope, just a trip."
00:04:38.153,00:04:39.279,I do that a lot.
00:04:39.320,00:04:40.280,What can I say?
00:04:40.321,00:04:41.782,I'm clumsy.
00:04:41.823,00:04:43.825,Yes. Now follow my finger.
00:04:50.331,00:04:53.794,You have some nystagmus -- an involuntary eye movement.
00:04:53.835,00:04:55.921,So what's that mean?
00:04:55.963,00:04:57.839,"When you fell, did you hit your head?"
00:04:57.881,00:04:58.966,No.
00:04:59.007,00:05:00.467,"What, you think I have brain damage?"
00:05:00.508,00:05:03.095,Nystagmus can be a sign of a neurological issue.
00:05:03.137,00:05:04.138,Oh.
00:05:04.179,00:05:08.100,"Well, that would explain the C I got in social studies."
00:05:08.142,00:05:10.393,"That was another joke, wasn't it?"
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.520,Mm.
00:05:12.562,00:05:14.856,I'm going to order a head CT for you.
00:05:14.898,00:05:16.316,Go for it.
00:05:19.153,00:05:20.737,"Shaun, are you getting any sleep?"
00:05:20.779,00:05:22.197,Yes.
00:05:22.239,00:05:23.698,"I mean, really getting sleep?"
00:05:23.740,00:05:25.033,I got here on time.
00:05:25.075,00:05:26.034,"Well, that's good."
00:05:26.076,00:05:28.369,I used a teleportation device.
00:05:32.916,00:05:35.127,"Radiology form, please."
00:05:40.299,00:05:43.093,"Shaun, that boy, he looks like -- Steve."
00:05:43.135,00:05:44.469,He does.
00:05:44.511,00:05:46.054,Is he related?
00:05:46.096,00:05:48.932,"His name is Evan Gallico, so I don't think so."
00:05:51.310,00:05:52.894,Wow. That is uncanny.
00:05:52.936,00:05:54.313,Just coincidental.
00:05:54.353,00:05:56.523,He looks exactly like your brother.
00:05:56.564,00:05:57.565,"No, he doesn't."
00:05:57.607,00:05:59.442,His hair is shorter.
00:05:59.484,00:06:01.320,It freaks me out.
00:06:01.360,00:06:02.863,No.
00:06:02.904,00:06:05.991,"It's okay if it does -- No, he's not Steve."
00:06:10.453,00:06:12.956,I used a teleportation device was a joke.
00:06:14.875,00:06:17.044,"Yeah, that's...that's good."
00:06:25.760,00:06:30.557,"Kevin: So, I couldn't come to Mom's funeral because I fell in love."
00:06:32.642,00:06:34.311,She was another teacher at the school.
00:06:34.353,00:06:36.479,A Thai woman.
00:06:36.521,00:06:42.277,And she was kind and -- and beautiful and loving...
00:06:42.319,00:06:45.197,"and very, very sick."
00:06:45.239,00:06:47.782,She had a congenital heart defect.
00:06:53.330,00:06:58.793,"Look, if you don't want to tell me where you've been for the last six months, then don't."
00:06:59.920,00:07:01.713,But don't insult my intelligence.
00:07:01.755,00:07:03.173,"Well, I couldn't just leave her."
00:07:03.215,00:07:05.633,You couldn't leave her for five minutes to make a phone call?
00:07:07.677,00:07:09.346,This a bad time?
00:07:09.388,00:07:12.807,"No, come in."
00:07:17.104,00:07:19.647,"According to the CT, you have a lesion on your pancreas."
00:07:19.689,00:07:21.233,"Well, what do you think this lesion could be?"
00:07:21.275,00:07:22.192,Not sure.
00:07:22.234,00:07:24.027,That's why we need to biopsy it.
00:07:24.069,00:07:26.071,It could just be a benign cyst.
00:07:26.113,00:07:26.947,Or...?
00:07:26.988,00:07:29.449,Or...
00:07:29.490,00:07:32.493,"it could be cancer, right?"
00:07:32.535,00:07:34.121,We'll know soon enough.
00:07:51.054,00:07:52.555,This won't take long.
00:07:52.597,00:07:54.474,Evan: I know.
00:07:54.515,00:07:56.143,One more and I get my Scout badge.
00:08:00.605,00:08:01.689,That was funny.
00:08:01.731,00:08:05.860,"Tough to tell without looking at you, but I'm guessing that was sarcasm."
00:08:05.902,00:08:11.199,"No. I have autism, which makes it hard for me to read social cues."
00:08:11.241,00:08:12.409,Jokes are difficult.
00:08:12.451,00:08:15.036,I used to know a kid with autism. Peter.
00:08:15.078,00:08:18.915,He was kind of weird but super nice.
00:08:18.957,00:08:20.500,Used to know?
00:08:20.541,00:08:22.336,You don't know him anymore?
00:08:22.377,00:08:23.837,He died.
00:08:23.878,00:08:26.131,Hit by a car.
00:08:26.173,00:08:28.716,You know anyone who died?
00:08:28.758,00:08:30.385,My brother.
00:08:30.427,00:08:31.594,That sucks.
00:08:35.140,00:08:37.225,Why did you have the other CT scans?
00:08:39.602,00:08:41.646,"uh, what's the word for fear of getting sick?"
00:08:41.688,00:08:43.398,Hypochondriasis?
00:08:43.440,00:08:45.317,"Mm, no, worse than that."
00:08:45.359,00:08:48.028,They have...nosophobia.
00:08:48.069,00:08:49.904,I love that word.
00:08:49.946,00:08:52.824,What do you think of Miss Gannett?
00:08:52.866,00:08:53.992,She's nice.
00:08:54.034,00:08:56.995,I think she's callipygian.
00:08:57.037,00:08:58.497,She's what?
00:08:58.538,00:08:59.747,Callipygian?
00:08:59.789,00:09:02.709,"It means having shapely buttocks, Shaun."
00:09:06.463,00:09:08.089,You read the dictionary.
00:09:08.131,00:09:11.092,"What it lacks in plot, it makes up for in vocab."
00:09:11.134,00:09:13.803,"So, you married?"
00:09:13.845,00:09:16.097,Girlfriend?
00:09:16.139,00:09:17.765,Boyfriend?
00:09:17.807,00:09:19.226,Tropical fish?
00:09:21.478,00:09:22.937,I like Lea.
00:09:22.979,00:09:25.106,Ooh. And who's Lea?
00:09:25.148,00:09:26.358,Lea is a friend.
00:09:26.400,00:09:28.360,A friend you date?
00:09:28.402,00:09:30.445,A friend with benefits?
00:09:30.487,00:09:33.114,I lend her batteries sometimes.
00:09:33.156,00:09:34.157,I like where this is going...
00:09:38.661,00:09:41.248,"So, you know, keep going."
00:09:41.289,00:09:43.583,"'Cause if you don't, I will."
00:09:43.624,00:09:45.210,"It's kind of my thing, you know?"
00:09:45.252,00:09:47.421,Just constant talking -- annoys everyone.
00:09:49.756,00:09:51.883,Hey.
00:09:51.925,00:09:53.176,Hey.
00:09:53.218,00:09:55.845,"...my friends are very talkative as well, so..."
00:09:55.887,00:09:57.514,You're giving the fractured arm a head CT?
00:09:57.556,00:09:58.890,Yes.
00:09:58.932,00:10:00.058,He's not clumsy.
00:10:04.938,00:10:06.481,Forget the pancreas.
00:10:13.447,00:10:15.449,Mr. and Mrs. Gallico?
00:10:15.490,00:10:16.866,Hi.
00:10:16.908,00:10:18.159,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
00:10:18.201,00:10:19.327,I'm treating your son.
00:10:19.369,00:10:20.412,"Well, how is he?"
00:10:20.454,00:10:23.457,"We were told it was a bad break, but it should heal no problem."
00:10:23.498,00:10:25.083,I know why Evan tripped.
00:10:25.125,00:10:29.546,"He had a tumor in the temporal bone behind his left ear, which is affecting his balance."
00:10:29.588,00:10:33.716,"I've arranged for a consult with Dr. Najid in oncology and she's going -- No, that won't be necessary."
00:10:33.758,00:10:37.387,We -- We already have an oncologist.
00:10:39.264,00:10:42.683,Evan's been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.
00:10:42.725,00:10:44.685,He was complaining of a sore shin.
00:10:44.727,00:10:48.523,The last thing that we expected was bone cancer.
00:10:48.565,00:10:52.319,"The doctors at SFM, they gave him a year to live."
00:10:55.363,00:10:58.074,That was seven months ago.
00:10:58.116,00:11:03.913,Osteosarcoma explains the severity of his fracture -- he will need pins in his arm after all.
00:11:03.955,00:11:05.248,"Uh, can we see him?"
00:11:05.290,00:11:07.626,Yes. He's in room 414.
00:11:07.667,00:11:09.461,"Uh, Dr. Murphy?"
00:11:11.838,00:11:15.258,He doesn't know about his diagnosis.
00:11:15.300,00:11:18.928,We would really like to keep it that way.
00:11:28.980,00:11:30.190,He's the patient.
00:11:30.231,00:11:31.941,Doesn't he have the right to know the truth?
00:11:31.983,00:11:33.067,"Well, no."
00:11:33.109,00:11:35.278,"He's also a minor, so, no, he doesn't."
00:11:35.320,00:11:37.822,Evan's very intelligent -- he'd be able to handle it.
00:11:37.864,00:11:40.200,"Well, Shaun, maybe it's not just about Evan."
00:11:40.241,00:11:43.119,"Maybe it's about his parents, as well."
00:11:43.161,00:11:46.998,Maybe it's just too difficult for them to tell Evan right now.
00:11:47.040,00:11:48.166,I don't know.
00:11:48.208,00:11:49.417,Then they're the ones who shouldn't be told.
00:11:49.459,00:11:56.757,"Well, let me ask you this, Shaun -- what's so wrong about Evan being allowed to enjoy as much of his life as possible?"
00:11:56.799,00:11:58.510,Evan wants to know the truth.
00:11:58.552,00:11:59.718,How do you know that?
00:12:03.890,00:12:08.727,"If this were Steve, if this were your brother, would he want to know the truth?"
00:12:08.769,00:12:10.146,Is that what this is?
00:12:15.235,00:12:17.571,Dad's such a tool.
00:12:17.612,00:12:20.574,"I found my birthday present -- in their closet, right where they always hide it."
00:12:20.615,00:12:23.784,I was just about to open it when Dad caught me snooping and freaked out.
00:12:23.826,00:12:26.996,I hate all that phony surprise stuff.
00:12:27.038,00:12:29.999,It's an AquaBlast Water Cannon.
00:12:30.041,00:12:32.293,I was with Mom when she bought it.
00:12:32.335,00:12:33.628,"Thank you, Shaun."
00:12:33.670,00:12:35.630,Your honesty's refreshing!
00:12:39.050,00:12:42.387,"Yes, he would want to know the truth."
00:12:42.429,00:12:44.972,"Well, there's nothing we can do about it."
00:12:45.014,00:12:46.974,It's not your decision -- it's theirs.
00:13:03.782,00:13:04.951,"Claire, I need you."
00:13:06.911,00:13:08.496,"Sure, what's up?"
00:13:12.417,00:13:15.336,Okay...
00:13:15.378,00:13:17.130,I'm flattered?
00:13:20.759,00:13:23.595,"Hey, doc?"
00:13:23.637,00:13:26.180,There's something I need to tell my dad.
00:13:26.222,00:13:29.225,We haven't moved him.
00:13:32.061,00:13:35.398,Do you have a medical question for me?
00:13:35.440,00:13:36.857,Is he dying?
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.192,We don't know yet.
00:13:38.234,00:13:40.194,The biopsy will tell us more.
00:13:40.236,00:13:41.362,Okay.
00:13:45.784,00:13:47.577,My dad is a good guy.
00:13:49.912,00:13:53.958,"We've just never been on the same page, you know?"
00:13:54.000,00:14:00.173,My mother was the one that I could talk to -- same for him.
00:14:00.214,00:14:06.554,"So, without her, we're both pretty useless."
00:14:12.477,00:14:14.729,Room 326.
00:14:14.771,00:14:15.522,Right.
00:14:22.821,00:14:24.864,Dr. Murphy called me in for a second opinion.
00:14:24.905,00:14:29.285,"Um, you need some pins in your arm."
00:14:29.327,00:14:30.244,Why?
00:14:30.286,00:14:31.788,What's changed?
00:14:31.830,00:14:40.839,"Well, after studying the radiology report, given how bad the break is, we just think it would be a prudent step to ensure an efficient and thorough mending to the break."
00:14:40.880,00:14:43.007,Will I be able to play baseball again?
00:14:43.049,00:14:47.470,"Well, I don't see why not, once it's completely healed, after some physiotherapy."
00:14:47.512,00:14:49.180,How long before I can pitch?
00:14:49.222,00:14:51.015,It's hard to say.
00:14:57.063,00:14:59.065,He wanted someone to lie for him.
00:14:59.106,00:15:03.611,And he picked you.
00:15:03.653,00:15:05.572,Merrill's son asked for personal advice.
00:15:05.613,00:15:06.740,And he picked you.
00:15:06.781,00:15:08.408,"I know, right?"
00:15:08.449,00:15:11.870,He's lying to his dad about something.
00:15:11.911,00:15:13.371,Yeah? What?
00:15:13.413,00:15:14.831,I don't know.
00:15:14.873,00:15:16.290,You didn't ask?
00:15:16.332,00:15:19.919,"It didn't seem relevant, medically."
00:15:19.960,00:15:22.797,You know it's not that difficult to be a human being.
00:15:22.839,00:15:30.096,"Just tell him to come clean, honesty is the best policy, a lie is a stone in your heart."
00:15:30.137,00:15:31.514,Who said the last one?
00:15:31.556,00:15:32.891,Me.
00:15:32.932,00:15:33.933,I made it up.
00:15:33.974,00:15:34.851,Hmm.
00:15:37.562,00:15:40.064,And...I got it.
00:15:42.442,00:15:43.526,He's anaphylactic.
00:15:43.568,00:15:44.694,Would you get me an epi?
00:15:44.736,00:15:46.529,The throat's constricting.
00:15:59.709,00:16:03.755,"So, what's up with Dr. Browne?"
00:16:03.797,00:16:07.300,"She's Lea, isn't she?"
00:16:07.341,00:16:08.593,Claire is my colleague.
00:16:08.635,00:16:12.847,"Oh, come on, I saw the way you were looking at her."
00:16:12.889,00:16:13.973,How?
00:16:16.225,00:16:18.018,I don't think I look like that.
00:16:18.060,00:16:21.188,"Okay, so then why'd you call her in for a consult?"
00:16:21.230,00:16:23.650,Mm...
00:16:23.691,00:16:25.819,Okay.
00:16:25.860,00:16:29.363,"Yes, she's better at talking to people than I am."
00:16:29.405,00:16:32.992,Wow. I counted like 50 tells there.
00:16:33.033,00:16:35.369,You really suck at lying.
00:16:35.411,00:16:37.664,Too bad.
00:16:39.833,00:16:42.627,So how do you know when to lie?
00:16:42.669,00:16:45.171,"When people need to know things, they need to know."
00:16:45.212,00:16:48.508,"If they don't, lie through your teeth and feel good about it."
00:16:48.549,00:16:51.385,"What if they need to know the truth, but it'll hurt them?"
00:16:54.931,00:16:58.100,"Some can handle it, some can't."
00:16:58.142,00:17:00.520,So how do you know who can and who can't?
00:17:00.561,00:17:01.729,You tell the truth.
00:17:01.771,00:17:04.315,"If they like you after, then you'll know."
00:17:04.357,00:17:05.608,If they don't?
00:17:05.650,00:17:08.235,Then it doesn't really matter anyway.
00:17:13.282,00:17:14.617,You have cancer.
00:17:19.330,00:17:22.500,"Yeah, I know."
00:17:30.925,00:17:32.927,My parents took me in for a sore leg.
00:17:32.969,00:17:37.724,"After a whole bunch of tests, they talked to the doctor, then came out and told me I was fine."
00:17:37.765,00:17:40.852,That's it.
00:17:40.894,00:17:44.438,"The next day, they bought me a PS4."
00:17:44.480,00:17:50.695,"So I Googled my symptoms, and I narrowed it down to osteosarcoma or growing pains."
00:17:50.737,00:17:53.823,Kids don't get gaming systems for growing pains.
00:17:55.700,00:17:59.412,"Hey, it's okay."
00:18:01.873,00:18:03.332,I'm not afraid to die.
00:18:03.374,00:18:04.876,You're not?
00:18:04.918,00:18:10.548,"Well, I mean, the dying part will suck if it hurts, but..."
00:18:15.511,00:18:17.055,Because I don't.
00:18:19.807,00:18:25.229,"If I believe in Heaven, then I got to believe in God, then I got to believe God made me sick."
00:18:25.271,00:18:27.690,How messed up is that?
00:18:27.732,00:18:38.242,"It's just easier to think that it's all random and when it's over, it's just..."
00:18:38.284,00:18:39.452,over.
00:18:44.582,00:18:46.793,So what about Lea?
00:18:46.834,00:18:48.962,Where'd you guys meet?
00:18:49.003,00:18:50.546,In the hallway.
00:18:54.717,00:18:55.969,That's a beautiful story.
00:18:56.010,00:18:57.261,Yes.
00:18:57.303,00:18:59.013,She's my neighbor.
00:18:59.055,00:19:01.766,Convenient.
00:19:01.808,00:19:03.434,He had another allergic reaction.
00:19:03.476,00:19:06.020,The pancreas?
00:19:06.062,00:19:08.522,And the second attack was even more severe than the first.
00:19:08.564,00:19:12.068,"It coincided with biopsying the pancreatic lesion, which now appears was a cyst."
00:19:12.110,00:19:14.236,"Well, now we know he's allergic to whatever's in that cyst."
00:19:14.278,00:19:17.949,We also that the next cyst that pops will probably kill him.
00:19:17.991,00:19:20.618,"Let's run a couple tests, see if there's any evidence of parasites."
00:19:20.660,00:19:24.455,"And MRI his entire body -- if we're lucky, he only had the two cysts and he can go home."
00:19:28.459,00:19:30.294,Are you looking for loopholes?
00:19:30.336,00:19:31.754,Hoping to save Evan?
00:19:31.796,00:19:33.923,Everyone makes mistakes.
00:19:33.965,00:19:36.801,Which means you should double-check every file in the hospital.
00:19:36.843,00:19:41.973,The oncologist flagged his neutrophil count of 634 as low.
00:19:42.015,00:19:42.890,That is low.
00:19:42.932,00:19:44.017,Low normal.
00:19:44.058,00:19:46.477,I can still hear the word low in there.
00:19:46.519,00:19:47.979,Mm.
00:19:51.190,00:19:53.067,He's just a kid.
00:19:53.109,00:19:56.195,I know how hard it is to think of him dying.
00:19:56.236,00:19:58.572,He's okay with that.
00:19:58.614,00:20:00.199,I find that hard to believe.
00:20:00.240,00:20:03.661,"We all die -- if we accepted that, we'd be happier."
00:20:03.703,00:20:08.207,Maybe. But we're not good with contentment.
00:20:08.248,00:20:10.584,Fighting death is what keeps us alive.
00:20:17.424,00:20:19.010,Okay.
00:20:20.302,00:20:21.971,We got a hit -- Echinococcus.
00:20:22.013,00:20:23.681,Jared: Echinococcus?
00:20:23.723,00:20:24.849,The cysts are filled with tapeworms?
00:20:24.891,00:20:26.392,Cysts?
00:20:26.433,00:20:28.102,Three more?
00:20:28.144,00:20:29.436,You missed the one in his brain.
00:20:32.732,00:20:34.525,Jared: Dr. Glassman?
00:20:34.567,00:20:35.776,Yeah?
00:20:35.818,00:20:37.403,"You used to be a neurosurgeon, right?"
00:20:37.444,00:20:38.821,So they say.
00:20:38.863,00:20:40.156,"Take this, will you?"
00:20:42.200,00:20:43.325,I need one.
00:20:43.367,00:20:44.577,Who would you recommend?
00:20:44.618,00:20:46.079,What you got?
00:20:51.959,00:20:53.544,"Wow, that's cool."
00:20:56.255,00:20:58.549,How the hell did I get tapeworms in my head?
00:20:58.591,00:21:00.551,"No idea, but you do."
00:21:00.593,00:21:02.803,You can pick up the eggs from coyotes or wolves.
00:21:02.845,00:21:04.847,You been hanging around coyotes or wolves?
00:21:04.889,00:21:07.558,I live in the suburbs -- we don't even have a petting zoo.
00:21:07.600,00:21:10.103,You might've had these cysts for quite some time.
00:21:10.144,00:21:13.564,"When one of them burst, that's what caused the first allergic reaction."
00:21:13.606,00:21:15.524,"Well, why did it burst?"
00:21:15.566,00:21:17.068,Why did it burst?
00:21:17.110,00:21:20.571,"Any sudden movements, twists, turns, squeeze."
00:21:20.613,00:21:21.614,A hug?
00:21:21.655,00:21:24.533,Could be.
00:21:28.829,00:21:32.666,I punctured the cyst on your pancreas during the biopsy.
00:21:32.708,00:21:36.420,"As you've seen, allergic reactions get worse each time they happen."
00:21:36.462,00:21:37.671,"So a third one, that would be bad."
00:21:37.713,00:21:39.173,That would be...
00:21:39.215,00:21:40.299,That would be very bad.
00:21:40.340,00:21:44.428,So we're gonna have to surgically remove all the cysts intact.
00:21:44.470,00:21:47.723,Dr. Glassman's one of the most highly acclaimed neurosurgeons in the state.
00:21:47.765,00:21:49.225,You are very lucky to have him.
00:21:49.267,00:21:53.146,And Dr. Kalu is fast becoming a very accomplished flatterer.
00:21:53.187,00:21:56.274,"The cranial cyst, that is a big deal."
00:21:56.315,00:21:58.776,We're gonna have to take off the top of your skull.
00:21:58.818,00:22:00.861,You'd be digging in to my brain?
00:22:00.903,00:22:02.321,"Well, yeah, pretty much."
00:22:02.362,00:22:03.405,With saline.
00:22:03.447,00:22:07.409,"We use it to gently displace the cyst, and then, poof, it magically pops out."
00:22:07.451,00:22:08.661,Kind of like delivering a baby.
00:22:08.702,00:22:11.289,"You know, if childbirth were painless."
00:22:11.330,00:22:14.541,And then we move on to the other cysts.
00:22:14.583,00:22:16.794,"Hey, we're gonna take good care of you."
00:23:22.068,00:23:24.153,Evan doesn't have cancer.
00:23:38.376,00:23:39.960,It might not be cancer!
00:23:41.712,00:23:43.672,It might not be cancer!
00:23:45.841,00:23:47.509,Look at you on time -- two for two.
00:23:47.551,00:23:49.178,It might not be cancer.
00:23:49.220,00:23:51.305,Fractured arm?
00:23:51.347,00:23:53.724,You said he'd been diagnosed with stage four osteosarcoma.
00:23:53.766,00:24:04.402,"Evan was diagnosed with the flu eight months ago, but his symptoms were actually a better fit with Epstein-Barr virus, which is linked to Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which causes osteolytic lesions in the long bones of the upper limbs."
00:24:04.442,00:24:07.363,And those lesions could be misdiagnosed as signs of osteosarcoma.
00:24:07.405,00:24:08.906,Yes.
00:24:08.948,00:24:12.576,Langerhans can also manifest in the skull.
00:24:12.618,00:24:16.454,"Instead of a death sentence, he could have something that could easily be treated with prednisone?"
00:24:16.496,00:24:19.792,"Next, we need to do a bone-marrow aspiration to confirm."
00:24:19.833,00:24:21.127,I assume you've looked at his file.
00:24:21.168,00:24:22.253,For a very long time.
00:24:22.295,00:24:23.545,"Well, there must've been a biopsy."
00:24:23.587,00:24:24.797,What did the pathology report say?
00:24:24.838,00:24:26.173,Yes.
00:24:26.215,00:24:29.802,Both were positive for osteosarcoma.
00:24:29.843,00:24:32.763,Murphy...
00:24:32.805,00:24:35.308,Do you have any idea how unlikely it is to have two false positives?
00:24:35.349,00:24:36.600,0.3%.
00:24:36.642,00:24:38.144,Which we can comfortably round off to not likely.
00:24:38.185,00:24:45.234,"It is possible -- Yes, but it means telling the parents of a dying child that there's hope, when really there isn't."
00:24:45.276,00:24:46.944,Grab a shower and get ready for rounds.
00:24:53.700,00:24:56.662,Glassman: Imaginative and creative.
00:24:56.703,00:24:57.621,Yes.
00:24:58.914,00:24:59.999,0.3%.
00:25:00.040,00:25:01.250,330 to 1.
00:25:03.919,00:25:07.173,You really think that it's worth putting Evan's parents through all this?
00:25:07.214,00:25:08.382,Of course.
00:25:08.424,00:25:15.806,"If we did this 333 times, we'd be giving false hope to 332 people for approximately four hours, and we'd save one life."
00:25:15.848,00:25:18.351,Isn't that worth it?
00:25:18.392,00:25:21.437,"Anyway, Dr. Melendez won't let me ask for consent to test."
00:25:21.479,00:25:24.315,What if I don't tell them what I'm doing?
00:25:24.357,00:25:26.566,A blatant ethics violation -- that's your solution?
00:25:26.608,00:25:27.693,Yes.
00:25:27.734,00:25:29.362,How do I do that?
00:25:36.202,00:25:38.787,you do it and then don't tell anyone.
00:25:38.829,00:25:40.289,No one.
00:25:40.331,00:25:47.629,your attending noticed a low RBC count and needed to find the cause -- that's it -- no biggie.
00:25:47.671,00:25:48.255,Hmm.
00:25:58.098,00:26:01.310,You know Wilks' Grocery on Santa Clara 17th?
00:26:01.352,00:26:04.522,It's been an institution for nearly 60 years.
00:26:04.562,00:26:10.236,"My grandparents started it in 1958, and my wife and I took it over in '82."
00:26:10.277,00:26:16.450,"But when my wife got sick and I started talking to Kevin about taking it over, he just...took off."
00:26:18.244,00:26:21.705,"To him, it was just a place to sell lettuce and toilet paper."
00:26:24.875,00:26:29.713,My father chairs a real-estate development company in the U.K.
00:26:29.755,00:26:32.674,Thought I'd be the perfect person to set up the U.S. office.
00:26:32.716,00:26:35.135,"You wanted to be in the helping profession, hmm?"
00:26:35.177,00:26:37.846,I wanted to be in my profession.
00:26:37.888,00:26:42.309,"It's not about how small or how big the venture is, it's about doing something that's yours."
00:26:45.396,00:26:46.772,I guess.
00:26:53.112,00:26:55.948,"When he was little, we were inseparable."
00:26:58.576,00:27:03.163,"Ah, he used to love to come to the store to work."
00:27:06.250,00:27:10.670,"I even had a little apron made for him -- had his name on it, too."
00:27:10.712,00:27:13.799,"Still, you know, kids..."
00:27:13.840,00:27:16.176,grow up.
00:27:16.218,00:27:20.180,I'm just grateful that he stayed close to his mother.
00:27:20.222,00:27:24.684,"He could talk to her, tell her anything."
00:27:24.726,00:27:27.521,So could I.
00:27:27.563,00:27:29.815,And when she went...
00:27:35.154,00:27:38.198,...I lost them both.
00:27:38.240,00:27:40.284,Looks like he's back now.
00:27:40.326,00:27:46.081,All I know is he ditched me when I needed him.
00:27:46.123,00:27:54.089,"Well, you know, as a wise person once said, holding a grudge is a stone in your heart."
00:27:59.553,00:28:00.804,What's that for?
00:28:00.846,00:28:03.974,Local anaesthetic for a bone-marrow aspiration.
00:28:04.016,00:28:07.811,Why do I need a bone-marrow aspiration?
00:28:07.853,00:28:14.151,My attending saw a low RBC count and wants to find the cause -- no biggie.
00:28:14.193,00:28:15.444,No biggie?
00:28:15.486,00:28:16.987,You're lying.
00:28:17.029,00:28:19.072,What's going on?
00:28:19.114,00:28:22.951,"You already told me I have terminal cancer, what's worse than that?"
00:28:28.081,00:28:29.416,You might not.
00:28:31.709,00:28:37.841,"It might not be osteosarcoma -- might be Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which is treatable."
00:28:37.883,00:28:38.884,Treatable?
00:28:38.925,00:28:41.178,"As in, I might not die?"
00:28:41.220,00:28:44.014,That's why I need to aspirate -- to find out for sure.
00:28:44.056,00:28:45.599,Do my parents know?
00:28:45.641,00:28:49.603,Mm...I was told not to get their hopes up.
00:28:49.645,00:28:53.773,Then let's do it before they get back.
00:28:53.815,00:28:55.734,Roll onto your side.
00:29:06.328,00:29:08.414,Is there a Scout badge for aspirations?
00:29:09.540,00:29:11.083,I think someone just made a joke.
00:29:14.920,00:29:15.713,Hello.
00:29:15.754,00:29:16.672,What are you doing?
00:29:16.714,00:29:17.590,Painkiller.
00:29:17.631,00:29:20.217,My arm hurts.
00:29:20.259,00:29:23.554,That wouldn't explain why I'd be injecting your lumbar region.
00:29:28.058,00:29:29.685,"Okay. Yes, hello."
00:29:29.727,00:29:33.980,I think Evan may have been misdiagnosed with cancer.
00:29:34.022,00:29:38.569,I think he has something that creates bone lesions that look like osteosarcoma.
00:29:38.611,00:29:44.408,"It's a small chance, 0.3%, but I -- You -- You told Evan that he has cancer?"
00:29:44.450,00:29:46.993,And now you are telling him -- and us -- that he doesn't?
00:29:47.035,00:29:48.328,I'm telling you he might not.
00:29:48.370,00:29:50.330,That's why I need to perform this aspiration.
00:29:50.372,00:29:52.291,He says whatever I have might be treatable.
00:29:52.332,00:29:53.250,Are you insane?
00:29:53.292,00:29:54.460,No. I am not insane.
00:29:54.501,00:29:55.544,I thought you'd be happy.
00:29:55.586,00:30:00.466,There is a significant link between Langerhans cell histiocytosis and -- Go! Get out!
00:30:03.009,00:30:04.595,Let me get you some water.
00:30:09.891,00:30:10.934,"-Oh, my God!"
00:30:09.891,00:30:12.519,-Hands right here -- -Right here!
00:30:12.561,00:30:13.437,"Respiratory, stat!"
00:30:19.568,00:30:23.405,"He has a massive embolus, probably thrown from his fracture."
00:30:23.447,00:30:26.492,It's located at the bifurcation of the pulmonary arteries.
00:30:26.533,00:30:28.034,He's close to hemodynamic collapse.
00:30:28.076,00:30:29.286,"Yeah, no kidding."
00:30:29.328,00:30:30.912,I'd like to assist.
00:30:30.954,00:30:32.205,Not a chance.
00:30:32.247,00:30:35.208,Okay.
00:30:35.250,00:30:36.669,You're obviously too close to the case.
00:30:36.710,00:30:38.878,I think I'm just the right amount of close.
00:30:38.920,00:30:42.257,"Murphy, you lied to the parents just so you could try to prove your ridiculous theory."
00:30:42.299,00:30:46.011,You're too damn close.
00:30:46.052,00:30:47.680,"Saddle embolism, scrub in."
00:30:55.187,00:30:56.938,Melendez: We have to get rid of the embolus before he arrests.
00:30:56.980,00:30:58.774,His heart is barely pumping blood.
00:30:58.816,00:31:00.400,I can feel the pulmonary artery...
00:31:00.442,00:31:02.736,I just need to find the obstruction...there!
00:31:02.778,00:31:03.612,I got it.
00:31:03.654,00:31:05.113,Knife.
00:31:05.155,00:31:06.573,EKG is showing right heart strain.
00:31:06.615,00:31:07.700,He can't take this much longer.
00:31:07.741,00:31:11.787,"I know, but if I move any quicker, I could nick the left main artery and kill the boy."
00:31:17.000,00:31:19.419,The phrase no biggie gave me away.
00:31:19.461,00:31:21.588,"You really got to learn how to lie, Shaun."
00:31:23.632,00:31:25.175,Am I in trouble?
00:31:25.217,00:31:27.720,Yes.
00:31:27.761,00:31:29.888,Unless you're right.
00:31:29.929,00:31:31.765,"If I'm wrong, they shouldn't be upset."
00:31:36.144,00:31:38.355,"False hope, Shaun..."
00:31:38.397,00:31:40.315,it's just plain cruel.
00:31:56.498,00:31:58.834,Hey.
00:31:58.876,00:32:01.795,He talk to you?
00:32:01.837,00:32:03.672,Did you talk to him?
00:32:03.714,00:32:05.382,I don't know what to tell him.
00:32:10.804,00:32:12.389,"You love your father, don't you?"
00:32:12.431,00:32:13.849,"Yeah, of course."
00:32:13.891,00:32:16.101,"Right. Well, he's about to go in for brain surgery."
00:32:16.142,00:32:18.186,There's huge risks involved.
00:32:18.228,00:32:22.065,"Whatever this lie is, can you live the rest of your life knowing you kept it from him?"
00:32:34.703,00:32:38.373,My -- My girlfriend wasn't sick.
00:32:40.542,00:32:44.337,She's married with two kids -- had no intention of leaving them.
00:32:44.379,00:32:45.631,I-I was an idiot.
00:32:45.672,00:32:48.133,"You got your heart broken, that's the problem here?"
00:32:48.174,00:32:49.885,"No -- no, Dad."
00:32:49.927,00:32:50.886,The problem is...
00:32:52.053,00:32:58.685,I didn't run away to Thailand because I thought Wilks' Grocery was beneath me.
00:32:58.727,00:33:04.691,I was afraid that I would never be able to fill your shoes...
00:33:04.733,00:33:07.068,And then I proved myself right.
00:33:23.251,00:33:25.128,Left pulmonary artery's open.
00:33:25.170,00:33:26.296,Ring Forceps.
00:33:32.886,00:33:34.053,Come on.
00:33:36.849,00:33:38.141,Got it.
00:33:41.478,00:33:43.271,EKG is normalizing.
00:33:43.313,00:33:44.272,He's okay.
00:33:44.314,00:33:45.816,Nice job.
00:33:45.858,00:33:48.735,"All right, flush the left pulmonary artery and close him up."
00:33:48.777,00:33:49.778,Okay.
00:33:56.117,00:33:58.996,Um...Dr. Melendez...
00:33:59.037,00:34:00.706,Take a look at this.
00:34:29.026,00:34:33.238,"Recycling -- Shaun, very responsible."
00:34:33.279,00:34:35.532,It's a book.
00:34:35.574,00:34:36.867,I appreciate that.
00:34:46.668,00:34:48.003,"Thanks, Shaun."
00:35:06.063,00:35:09.315,"But while we were in there, we did find something else."
00:35:09.357,00:35:11.150,Lesions on his ribs.
00:35:14.529,00:35:17.699,Irrefutable proof of osteosarcoma.
00:35:17.741,00:35:19.993,It's metastasized to his chest cavity.
00:35:22.495,00:35:24.372,I'm sorry.
00:35:33.256,00:35:35.050,I'm very sorry.
00:35:55.487,00:35:59.908,"Glassman: Give that a nice, warm saline bath."
00:35:59.950,00:36:02.911,"Forceps and Taylor scissors, please."
00:36:02.953,00:36:03.996,Thank you.
00:36:13.171,00:36:14.380,Look at that.
00:36:14.422,00:36:22.139,"That's what built the pyramids, painted the Mona Lisa, invented the Internet."
00:36:23.556,00:36:26.476,There is our interloper.
00:36:26.518,00:36:28.603,"Squeezeball please, Deidre."
00:36:29.771,00:36:31.940,"His name for it, not ours."
00:36:31.982,00:36:43.785,The saline gently displaces the cyst and coaxes it out of its little hiding place -- Hopefully in one piece so we don't have to call 911.
00:36:43.827,00:36:45.871,"Come on, now..."
00:36:45.912,00:36:48.206,"Tray, please."
00:36:48.247,00:36:49.791,There we go...
00:36:49.833,00:36:52.377,A little bit more...
00:36:52.418,00:36:54.420,And there we go.
00:36:54.462,00:36:55.797,Got it.
00:36:56.798,00:36:58.633,He has his father's eyes.
00:36:58.675,00:37:00.343,That was incredible.
00:37:00.385,00:37:02.387,"One down, three to go..."
00:37:14.774,00:37:17.235,Hey.
00:37:17.276,00:37:20.030,"Hi, Sweetie."
00:37:20.072,00:37:21.656,What's the matter?
00:37:21.698,00:37:22.741,Nothing.
00:37:22.782,00:37:26.161,We're just happy you did so great.
00:37:27.913,00:37:30.707,You had what's called an embolism.
00:37:30.749,00:37:33.085,It clogged an artery in your lungs.
00:37:33.126,00:37:35.587,But the good news is they got it.
00:37:35.628,00:37:38.423,And you're gonna be just fine.
00:37:38.464,00:37:39.549,Still...
00:37:39.591,00:37:41.718,"too bad about the cancer, huh?"
00:37:41.760,00:37:43.136,"No, no, no, no."
00:37:43.178,00:37:46.806,"The doctor did not know what he was talking about -- Dad, I know all about it."
00:37:46.848,00:37:50.393,I have for a long time.
00:37:50.435,00:37:58.568,I -- I am so sorry.
00:37:58.610,00:38:01.279,It's okay.
00:38:18.213,00:38:21.466,"Grandma's gonna be there, too."
00:38:25.303,00:38:28.514,"Uncle Jim, if he figured out how to stop swearing."
00:38:35.105,00:38:36.689,"I'll get you some water, buddy."
00:38:47.617,00:38:51.454,"So, I took Penny for a walk -- just around the block."
00:38:53.832,00:38:59.754,"And I picked her up some of those rawhide treats, you know..."
00:38:59.796,00:39:01.881,the ones that Mom used to like to give to her.
00:39:08.263,00:39:10.223,"I miss her, Dad."
00:39:39.585,00:39:40.962,Evan: Coast is clear?
00:39:47.302,00:39:48.261,Yes.
00:39:48.303,00:39:50.429,Thank you.
00:39:50.471,00:39:52.057,"Mm, I was wrong."
00:39:52.098,00:39:53.266,You tried.
00:39:53.308,00:39:54.684,I was wrong.
00:39:56.519,00:39:57.979,Your parents hate me.
00:39:58.021,00:39:58.980,I know.
00:39:59.022,00:40:01.274,I gave you false hope.
00:40:01.316,00:40:04.027,"But for a minute there, it was pretty awesome."
00:40:07.030,00:40:09.074,I'm going to ask you for a favor.
00:40:11.576,00:40:14.453,"Well, I'm not giving away my Make-A-Wish."
00:40:14.495,00:40:16.873,"Mm, would you mind if I read you something?"
00:40:16.915,00:40:18.750,It's not long.
00:40:18.791,00:40:20.752,That I can do.
00:40:30.387,00:40:32.847,Atticus was right.
00:40:32.889,00:40:39.062,One time he said you never really know a man until you stand in his shoes and walk around in them.
00:40:39.104,00:40:41.814,Just standing on the Radley porch was enough.
00:40:41.856,00:40:45.818,The streetlights were fuzzy from the fine rain that was falling...
00:41:12.720,00:41:20.228,"...'Atticus, he was real nice.' His hands were under my chin, pulling up the cover, tucking it around me."
00:41:20.270,00:41:26.859,"'Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.' He turned out the light and went into Jem's room."
00:41:26.901,00:41:32.198,"He would be there all night, and he would be there when Jem waked up in the morning."
00:41:37.203,00:41:39.622,Sounds like a good book.
00:41:39.664,00:41:41.833,"Could've used a spoiler alert, though."
00:41:49.257,00:41:51.217,Thank you.
00:42:01.019,00:42:03.313,That's all.
00:00:01.376,00:00:03.295,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:03.337,00:00:05.339,Is there something you're not telling me?
00:00:03.337,00:00:07.675,"When we're in meetings together, don't ever call my ideas ridiculous."
00:00:07.716,00:00:08.717,Come on.
00:00:08.759,00:00:09.927,So am I.
00:00:09.969,00:00:11.679,Merrill's son asked for personal advice.
00:00:11.720,00:00:13.597,And he picked you.
00:00:13.639,00:00:16.433,A surgeon needs to communicate.
00:00:16.475,00:00:17.643,Can he do that under stress?
00:00:17.685,00:00:21.856,Can he do that knowing that a human life literally hangs in the balance?
00:00:26.485,00:00:28.612,"Farrar: Thank you, Dr. Kalu."
00:00:28.654,00:00:30.322,Jared: You're welcome.
00:00:30.364,00:00:32.616,I roast the beans myself.
00:00:32.658,00:00:34.368,Smells like leather.
00:00:34.409,00:00:36.328,"Then none for you, Murphy."
00:00:36.370,00:00:39.331,I don't drink coffee.
00:00:40.374,00:00:41.792,It is dead in here.
00:00:41.834,00:00:43.711,That's why they call it the graveyard shift.
00:00:43.752,00:00:46.964,"Oh, well, I call it paradise."
00:00:47.006,00:00:52.553,"Ah, Doctors Murphy, Kalu, Browne -- meet Dr. Audrey Lim, your attending for the evening."
00:00:52.594,00:00:53.637,Hey.
00:00:53.679,00:00:55.138,He roasts the beans himself.
00:00:55.180,00:00:57.641,Oh. Kiss ass.
00:00:59.685,00:01:01.020,E.R.
00:01:02.980,00:01:05.399,How long?
00:01:05.440,00:01:06.525,"Listen up, everybody!"
00:01:06.567,00:01:08.027,We got a mass cas coming in.
00:01:08.068,00:01:09.945,"It's a bus crash, two dozen passengers."
00:01:09.987,00:01:13.156,Transfer all patients waiting for beds up to the nursing units.
00:01:13.198,00:01:14.825,Have maintenance bring down cots.
00:01:14.867,00:01:16.911,We're gonna convert the waiting room into triage.
00:01:16.952,00:01:18.746,No one goes home till we're all clear!
00:01:18.787,00:01:20.664,Dr. Lim: Page everyone on call. I don't care what department they are.
00:01:20.706,00:01:24.083,"Tonight, everybody's trauma."
00:01:37.222,00:01:39.349,I love these blank faces right before Armageddon.
00:01:39.391,00:01:40.642,Trauma color coding -- who knows it?
00:01:40.684,00:01:42.770,Green -- walking wounded.
00:01:42.811,00:01:44.187,Red needs immediate attention.
00:01:44.229,00:01:46.023,And black go straight to the morgue.
00:01:59.745,00:02:01.204,"All right, red tags, front of the line!"
00:02:01.246,00:02:02.664,"Red tags, front of the line."
00:02:02.706,00:02:04.625,Wedding bus blew a tire and flipped!
00:02:04.666,00:02:05.960,26-year-old female.
00:02:06.001,00:02:08.587,"Second- and third-degree burns to her neck, chest, and left arm."

00:02:13.216,00:02:15.135,EMT: Guy was ejected 30 feet from the vehicle.
00:02:15.176,00:02:19.306,"Multiple chest contusions, acute respiratory distress on the scene, sluggish pupillary response."
00:02:19.347,00:02:20.891,How long have you been doing CPR?
00:02:20.933,00:02:22.101,Have you shocked him?
00:02:22.142,00:02:23.894,We got to crack him.
00:02:23.936,00:02:25.562,You take the next one.
00:02:30.025,00:02:34.071,"We secured the foreign object and staunched the bleeding, but didn't want to touch it otherwise."
00:02:37.992,00:02:39.910,Good thing.
00:02:39.952,00:02:42.412,Right now it's a little Dutch boy keeping her from bleeding out.
00:02:42.454,00:02:45.290,Pulse ox is dropping.
00:02:45.332,00:02:47.126,O2 sats down to 83.
00:02:49.128,00:02:50.211,"Forget about the neck, Claire."
00:02:50.253,00:02:51.338,Treat her like any other patient.
00:02:51.379,00:02:52.840,What are the first steps?
00:02:52.881,00:02:54.591,"Airway, breathing, circulation."
00:02:54.633,00:02:56.802,Good. Grab a kit.
00:03:18.740,00:03:21.368,I need help here!
00:03:21.409,00:03:22.911,"Murphy, go!"
00:03:26.289,00:03:27.791,Let's go.
00:03:27.833,00:03:29.043,Trauma Three.
00:03:44.058,00:03:45.225,I can't stop the bleeding.
00:03:49.146,00:03:51.481,He's bleeding out.
00:03:58.238,00:04:04.745,"I need a urinary catheter, 14-gauge needle, arterial guide wire, occlusion balloon, and 20 cc of saline, stat."
00:04:04.786,00:04:30.979,-- Captions by VITAC -- EMT #2: What's he doing?
00:04:31.021,00:04:33.774,"Well, you don't have one, so I'm making a REBOA."
00:04:33.815,00:04:35.192,A what?
00:04:37.318,00:04:38.820,A REBOA.
00:04:40.030,00:04:41.073,Is that even a word?
00:04:41.115,00:04:44.325,A REBOA will occlude the damaged artery and stop the bleeding.
00:05:02.427,00:05:05.222,Release the pressure.
00:05:10.227,00:05:13.563,BP is stabilizing.
00:05:17.859,00:05:19.778,"Nice work, Dr. Murphy."
00:05:19.820,00:05:21.404,I made a REBOA.
00:05:23.907,00:05:24.992,Oxygen is dropping to 89.
00:05:25.033,00:05:26.243,All right. Light.

00:05:27.995,00:05:29.871,Throat's swollen from smoke inhalation.
00:05:31.165,00:05:33.917,Do you see soot in her mouth or nose?
00:05:33.959,00:05:35.836,She doesn't need a cric.
00:05:47.472,00:05:49.516,Sats are going back up.
00:05:49.557,00:05:51.310,Circumferential neck burns.
00:05:51.350,00:05:54.104,The shrinking charred skin is acting like a noose.
00:05:56.564,00:05:58.317,"Are you getting enough air now, ma'am?"
00:05:58.357,00:06:00.152,Yes. Thank you.
00:06:00.194,00:06:03.905,Now get her out of this petri dish and into an isolation ward in the burn unit ASAP.
00:06:03.947,00:06:05.157,"Yes, sir."
00:06:07.742,00:06:09.536,Your heart's a bit muffled.
00:06:09.577,00:06:10.996,Am I having a heart attack?
00:06:11.038,00:06:12.789,"No, but it's not completely good news."

00:06:20.130,00:06:21.464,We need a FAST ultrasound in here.
00:06:21.506,00:06:22.674,They're both in use.
00:06:24.176,00:06:25.886,You don't have imaging.
00:06:47.782,00:06:49.201,A REBOA.
00:06:49.243,00:06:50.618,Ballsy.
00:06:50.660,00:06:51.786,Could've gone really wrong.
00:06:51.828,00:06:54.873,"Yes, well, it didn't."
00:06:54.915,00:06:59.336,It's a cowboy move -- something you would never even dream of trying.
00:06:59.378,00:07:02.923,How many times is Shaun gonna have to prove himself before you give him a shot?
00:07:02.964,00:07:05.466,"Woman over PA: Dr. Rolendez, O.R. 6."
00:07:15.269,00:07:17.271,Swan girl came in and you hesitated.
00:07:17.312,00:07:19.814,I wasn't hesitating.
00:07:19.856,00:07:21.900,Murphy was thinking of the game plan.
00:07:21.942,00:07:23.610,You got overwhelmed.
00:07:23.651,00:07:24.652,I wasn't.
00:07:24.694,00:07:26.696,First trauma -- it happens.
00:07:26.738,00:07:29.991,"You have to think clearly, quickly, methodically."
00:07:30.033,00:07:31.910,You need to think a little more like Shaun.
00:07:33.620,00:07:36.415,A little more.
00:07:53.723,00:07:55.225,How you doing?
00:07:55.267,00:07:57.185,Sorry.
00:07:57.227,00:07:58.937,Sorry.
00:08:02.899,00:08:04.276,You're maxed out on morphine.
00:08:04.318,00:08:08.280,I'll hold off until it reloads.
00:08:11.866,00:08:13.410,How bad is it?
00:08:13.452,00:08:15.703,We're making good progress.
00:08:15.745,00:08:21.918,"I'll have to, uh, debride any deroofed blisters to prevent a secondary nosocomial and then -- I need a mirror."
00:08:21.960,00:08:25.922,It's the least you can do since you can't even look me in the eye.
00:09:00.707,00:09:10.467,"I decided that when I got married, my bridesmaids are gonna wear black cocktail dresses so they can use them again, you know?"
00:09:14.971,00:09:17.724,But now...
00:09:17.765,00:09:19.893,now I-I'm Freddy Krueger.
00:09:21.811,00:09:24.105,Who's gonna want to marry this?
00:09:27.984,00:09:31.946,"I'm gonna find a nurse, have her adjust your, uh -- your morphine drip."
00:09:37.702,00:09:39.079,Okay.
00:09:39.120,00:09:40.038,You hit your face.
00:09:40.080,00:09:41.789,Your jaw got stuck.
00:09:41.831,00:09:44.751,"So, this shot I just gave you is gonna knock you out so that I can fix that."
00:09:44.792,00:09:46.127,Hang tight.
00:09:46.169,00:09:48.463,Crash patients status check?
00:09:48.505,00:09:50.424,"One fatality on site, lost one in the E.R."
00:09:51.841,00:09:53.760,Got 13 yellow and green still in the waiting room.
00:09:53.801,00:09:55.970,I'll take whoever's up next.
00:09:53.801,00:09:57.972,"Marco Magallenes -- severed femoral artery, crushed femur."
00:09:58.014,00:10:01.059,I did the REBOA and then installed a temporary shunt.
00:10:01.101,00:10:03.853,Here are his CT and MRI results.
00:10:08.191,00:10:10.860,Find someone else for whoever's up next.
00:10:12.529,00:10:14.155,"Oh, finally."
00:10:32.173,00:10:34.301,Excuse me.
00:10:34.342,00:10:35.843,Ricardo: Yes.
00:10:35.885,00:10:39.139,We just found out that my cousin didn't survive the accident.
00:10:39.180,00:10:42.350,I'm sorry.
00:10:42.392,00:10:44.519,It's a bit much.
00:10:44.561,00:10:47.314,"I'm Dr. Melendez, and this is Dr. Murphy."
00:10:48.815,00:10:50.691,I'm M-Marco's father.
00:10:50.733,00:10:54.613,"This is, uh, his mother, Lorena, and this is Sonia."
00:10:54.654,00:10:56.697,They were getting married tonight.
00:10:56.739,00:10:58.199,How's my son?
00:10:58.241,00:11:02.287,"Marco's femur was completely shattered, and his lower leg isn't getting enough blood."
00:11:03.663,00:11:05.499,Can you save his leg?
00:11:05.540,00:11:07.959,Marco suffered too much bone fragmentation.
00:11:08.001,00:11:10.337,We can't fix it.
00:11:10.378,00:11:12.797,Our only choice is to amputate.
00:11:14.591,00:11:15.592,Mija.
00:11:28.813,00:11:30.689,Bay Five needs a grade three hyphema.
00:11:32.150,00:11:33.151,You read my mind.
00:11:33.193,00:11:34.569,Been a while.
00:11:34.611,00:11:36.321,How you holding up pulling an all-nighter?
00:11:36.363,00:11:41.075,"I'll manage, but if you can find me a caffeine IV, it'd be helpful."
00:11:43.244,00:11:45.163,Melendez: Tough night.
00:11:46.289,00:11:47.874,It's part of the job.
00:11:47.915,00:11:50.251,"So, when's the big day?"
00:11:50.293,00:11:52.879,"Uh, we haven't set it yet."
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.339,"Oh, where is it gonna be?"
00:11:54.381,00:11:56.883,We'll figure it out.
00:11:58.552,00:12:00.011,We should talk about this later.
00:12:00.053,00:12:01.596,What? I like beaches.
00:12:01.638,00:12:04.140,If you have a more romantic idea...
00:12:04.182,00:12:06.393,My family likes churches.
00:12:08.353,00:12:09.854,We should talk about this later.
00:12:09.896,00:12:14.067,"Dr. Lim, I think one of your yellows is about to turn red."
00:12:14.108,00:12:16.236,Hey.
00:12:16.277,00:12:18.446,Farrar: I've got my wedding all planned out.
00:12:18.488,00:12:20.990,"I've got the dress, and I've got the flowers."
00:12:21.032,00:12:22.867,All I need is a groom.
00:12:24.285,00:12:26.371,"You available, Dr. Murphy?"
00:12:27.788,00:12:29.790,You don't want some love?
00:12:29.832,00:12:32.960,"No. No, I don't."
00:12:37.090,00:12:39.676,"Dr. Glassman, neural consult, bay three."
00:12:39.718,00:12:41.678,Thank you.
00:12:45.724,00:12:46.683,Hey!
00:12:46.725,00:12:48.059,I was here first.
00:12:48.101,00:12:50.019,Shaun.
00:12:50.061,00:12:51.688,Shaun!
00:12:51.730,00:12:53.356,My patient's scans are very important.
00:12:53.398,00:12:54.899,"Well, my patient's important, too."
00:12:54.941,00:12:57.985,I need to see my patient's scans.
00:12:58.027,00:12:59.529,Is your patient pre-op or post-op?
00:12:59.571,00:13:02.115,Pre-op.
00:13:02.156,00:13:05.076,"Okay, I'll give you the computer, but you need to apologize first."
00:13:05.118,00:13:07.120,"Okay, I'm sorry."
00:13:12.833,00:13:19.507,Why was Marco's family crying when Dr. Melendez told them his leg would need to be amputated?
00:13:19.549,00:13:22.719,"Well, their son's leg is about to be cut off."
00:13:22.761,00:13:25.680,It's sad.
00:13:25.722,00:13:30.017,"But when your options are amputation or death, amputation is good news."
00:13:30.059,00:13:33.062,People need time to adjust to big changes.
00:13:33.104,00:13:36.065,Marco's family didn't even get a chance to pray for a miracle.
00:13:43.906,00:13:47.994,Mm.
00:13:48.035,00:13:51.164,The bone damage is too severe.
00:13:51.205,00:13:52.999,A rod implantation won't work.
00:13:53.040,00:14:00.423,"There's nothing to anchor into, and the shunt won't last long enough to do reconstruction."
00:14:00.465,00:14:02.592,There are no other options.
00:14:05.928,00:14:09.015,What if we could replace the entire femur?
00:14:17.064,00:14:21.110,3D-printed bones have only successfully been done with the mandible.
00:14:21.152,00:14:23.070,That's a fairly small bone.
00:14:23.112,00:14:25.114,A femur has to support the weight of the entire body.
00:14:25.156,00:14:27.617,This one will be titanium.
00:14:27.659,00:14:30.453,It's an interesting idea...
00:14:30.495,00:14:32.163,but I need to think on it.
00:14:32.205,00:14:34.749,Right now we still got seven yellow tags waiting.
00:14:34.791,00:14:36.083,What do you have to think about?
00:14:36.125,00:14:37.794,It's a good idea.
00:14:37.836,00:14:39.295,The kid has brilliant ideas.
00:14:37.836,00:14:43.717,"That doesn't mean -- No, it was my idea, and I'm aware of the risks -- infection, clotting, hardware failure..."
00:14:43.758,00:14:44.801,Death.
00:14:44.843,00:14:46.845,It wasn't your idea.
00:14:46.886,00:14:49.597,"And the risks are significant, but isn't that their call?"
00:14:49.639,00:14:54.977,"Don't we have to -- Maybe he said something, and then you said something, and together, you -- My idea."
00:14:55.019,00:14:57.980,The brilliant idea is 100% my brilliant idea.
00:14:58.022,00:14:59.482,Why is that a problem for you?
00:14:59.524,00:15:02.485,Maybe because I've known you for six months.
00:15:02.527,00:15:04.529,Every day we learn new things.
00:15:06.865,00:15:08.241,The idea was brilliant.
00:15:08.282,00:15:09.868,And it was mine.
00:15:09.909,00:15:13.329,"And if anyone can do this brilliant surgery, it's you."
00:15:13.371,00:15:17.417,Flattery -- also brilliant.
00:15:24.924,00:15:27.301,Claire: Sleeping on the job?
00:15:27.343,00:15:29.970,fresh air.
00:15:30.012,00:15:32.223,Feels like I'm suffocating in there.
00:15:34.058,00:15:39.731,"She's in pain, spilling her guts out, and every time I open my mouth, I sound like an idiot."
00:15:39.773,00:15:42.650,Dr. Kalu -- unable to talk to women.
00:15:42.692,00:15:44.026,There's a first.
00:15:44.068,00:15:46.153,"If you're not gonna be helpful, Claire, just leave."
00:15:48.239,00:15:52.660,You don't need to talk.
00:15:52.702,00:15:55.371,"You get to come out here, clear your head."
00:15:55.413,00:15:58.666,"She's trapped in there, alone with her thoughts, her fears."
00:15:58.708,00:16:01.502,You don't think she wants to get out?
00:16:01.544,00:16:04.171,You are her escape.
00:16:10.970,00:16:13.765,You want to put a fake femur into Marco's leg?
00:16:13.807,00:16:15.809,It's not fake.
00:16:15.850,00:16:18.185,It's not a real bone.
00:16:18.227,00:16:19.228,It's still real.
00:16:19.270,00:16:20.688,That's incredible.
00:16:20.730,00:16:23.190,"And Marco will be able to walk, run, climb?"
00:16:23.232,00:16:25.234,And swim.
00:16:25.276,00:16:27.612,Hopefully.
00:16:27.654,00:16:30.281,"Well, have you done the surgery before?"
00:16:30.323,00:16:32.241,I haven't.
00:16:34.160,00:16:37.789,"Well, nobody has ever attempted this surgery with a bone as large as the femur."
00:16:37.831,00:16:40.583,"I believe it's a viable option, but there are risks."
00:16:40.625,00:16:43.294,Risks?
00:16:43.336,00:16:47.173,"In my estimation, there's a 10% chance he won't make it."
00:16:47.214,00:16:48.591,I'm not losing my son.
00:16:48.633,00:16:53.095,"Wait. If there's a chance we can save Marco's leg, we should at least discuss this some more."
00:16:53.137,00:16:54.138,That's what he'd want.
00:16:54.180,00:16:55.515,He'd want to live.
00:16:57.642,00:16:59.101,I know him.
00:17:00.812,00:17:06.776,I will never forgive myself if Marco died because I made a reckless decision.
00:17:06.818,00:17:08.277,Whose decision is this?
00:17:08.319,00:17:10.112,Does he have a healthcare proxy?
00:17:10.154,00:17:11.614,I don't know what that is.
00:17:11.656,00:17:15.451,"When the accident happened, were you on the way to your wedding or on the way back?"
00:17:15.493,00:17:17.704,We were headed to the wedding.
00:17:17.745,00:17:20.122,Marco's parents are the next of kin.
00:17:20.164,00:17:21.248,They decide.
00:17:27.630,00:17:29.716,Please...
00:17:29.757,00:17:31.551,amputate our son's leg.
00:17:36.305,00:17:37.431,Murphy.
00:17:44.355,00:17:50.319,Why is the primary closure on the stump so vital in amputation surgery?
00:17:50.361,00:17:52.196,Why are you marrying Jessica?
00:17:53.948,00:17:55.992,Why does anyone get married?
00:17:56.034,00:17:57.702,I don't know.
00:17:59.286,00:18:01.455,I love her.
00:18:01.497,00:18:05.960,I don't understand why having someone to love is so important to everyone.
00:18:07.461,00:18:09.380,You have to stand down.
00:18:09.422,00:18:11.507,You can't amputate Marco's leg.
00:18:11.549,00:18:14.719,I filed an emergency injunction to stop the surgery.
00:18:18.389,00:18:19.974,You were in a car accident.
00:18:20.016,00:18:21.893,Your neck was punctured.
00:18:21.935,00:18:23.561,The repair surgery went well.
00:18:23.603,00:18:27.523,You're gonna have to stay put for a week before we can release you.
00:18:27.565,00:18:29.650,You're very lucky to be alive.
00:18:37.241,00:18:41.996,Jenna Hensel -- is she okay?
00:18:42.038,00:18:43.957,Can I see her?
00:18:48.086,00:18:50.170,She's not listed.
00:18:50.212,00:18:51.547,That's a good thing.
00:18:51.589,00:18:53.633,She's probably still in the waiting room.
00:18:53.674,00:18:55.426,I'll find her and bring her up.
00:18:55.468,00:18:57.511,She'll be relieved to know you're okay.
00:18:57.553,00:19:00.264,Okay.
00:19:00.306,00:19:04.268,What the hell am I supposed to do with an unconscious patient whose leg is a ticking time bomb?
00:19:04.310,00:19:05.394,Judge Singh is en route.
00:19:05.436,00:19:08.230,She wants to hear from both parties and the doctors on the case.
00:19:08.272,00:19:10.024,I have to testify?
00:19:10.066,00:19:11.150,Hopefully not.
00:19:11.191,00:19:12.860,I thought you would be happy.
00:19:12.902,00:19:17.448,"You thought you could save the leg, and I didn't want that not happening because the parents are afraid to make a tough call."
00:19:17.490,00:19:19.075,It's their call to make.
00:19:19.117,00:19:22.244,"And if the accident happened an hour later, it would be the wife's."
00:19:22.286,00:19:23.913,And she wants the fake leg.
00:19:23.955,00:19:25.748,It's not fake.
00:19:25.790,00:19:28.960,I thought you didn't believe in just blindly following protocol.
00:19:29.002,00:19:30.169,He's their son.
00:19:30.210,00:19:31.838,Nobody's gonna love him more than them.
00:19:31.879,00:19:32.839,Seriously?
00:19:32.880,00:19:35.925,All parents love all children more than anybody else?
00:19:35.967,00:19:38.094,People get divorced all the time.
00:19:38.136,00:19:39.553,How often do they give up their kids?
00:19:39.595,00:19:42.682,"So, if this was us, you'd want your parents to decide over me?"
00:19:42.723,00:19:44.558,I didn't say that.
00:19:45.977,00:19:52.650,"I was saying, there needs to be rules, that there needs to be bright red lines telling us who gets to make these calls."
00:19:52.692,00:19:54.276,It's the parents' call.
00:19:54.318,00:19:55.862,Not anymore.
00:19:55.903,00:19:57.822,Now it's the judge's.
00:19:57.864,00:20:00.033,How much time does Marco have left on the temporary shunt?
00:20:00.074,00:20:03.828,"Three hours, and then his leg will die."
00:20:06.914,00:20:08.415,Okay.
00:20:17.175,00:20:19.927,Dr. Torture returns.
00:20:19.969,00:20:22.262,Thought I'd scared you off for good.
00:20:22.304,00:20:24.140,Pick a movie.
00:20:24.182,00:20:26.976,"You deserve to get out of this room for a little while, too."
00:20:29.311,00:20:32.648,You think Groundhog Day is gonna make a difference?
00:20:32.690,00:20:36.569,"I'm torturing you, but, hey, you get to watch a funny movie."
00:20:36.610,00:20:38.863,"That is sort of what I was going for, yeah."
00:20:43.201,00:20:44.410,I'm sorry.
00:20:47.080,00:20:49.916,I wish there was something else I could do.
00:20:49.957,00:20:51.209,How do you know there isn't?
00:20:51.250,00:20:52.919,This is protocol.
00:20:52.960,00:20:54.587,I lucked out.
00:20:54.628,00:20:58.174,I got the world's greatest expert on burn victims?
00:20:58.216,00:21:00.509,You know everything that can be done.
00:21:04.055,00:21:07.516,"He loves to rock-climb, scuba dive, bungee-jump."
00:21:07.558,00:21:09.185,This is insane.
00:21:09.227,00:21:12.605,His leg is literally dying while we sit here reminiscing.
00:21:12.646,00:21:15.691,Please. We're trying to figure out what your son would want.
00:21:15.733,00:21:17.443,He would want to live.
00:21:15.733,00:21:22.489,"I want that, too, but if there's a way that we can save Marco's leg, he'd want me to do it."
00:21:22.531,00:21:26.577,"Mija, Do you know what he wanted most of all?"
00:21:29.247,00:21:31.040,He wanted to marry you.
00:21:31.082,00:21:34.252,"He wanted to spend his life with you, have children with you."
00:21:34.293,00:21:36.336,"Now, he can do all that."
00:21:36.378,00:21:40.007,He can be happy with a prosthetic leg.
00:21:41.467,00:21:44.053,"He's young, and he's strong."
00:21:44.095,00:21:46.472,"Mija, he can get through this."
00:21:51.769,00:21:55.148,When we met -- I don't care about your stories.
00:22:00.903,00:22:03.948,I just want -- We met in rehab.
00:22:13.791,00:22:15.918,"Hey, are either of you Jenna Hensel?"
00:22:15.960,00:22:19.546,I haven't seen Jenna since we took pictures at the hotel.
00:22:19.588,00:22:21.048,But she got on the bus?
00:22:21.090,00:22:23.176,"Yeah, she was sitting with Noomi."
00:22:29.431,00:22:31.225,I think she's still out there.
00:22:31.267,00:22:33.227,"Hey, guys!"
00:22:33.269,00:22:35.146,To the crash site.
00:22:35.188,00:22:37.898,He never wanted you to know.
00:22:40.318,00:22:41.944,He's an addict.
00:22:41.986,00:22:45.281,He replaced one addiction for another one -- a healthier one.
00:22:45.323,00:22:48.617,But he needs -- What?
00:22:48.659,00:22:52.288,He needs to wakeboard or he'll drink himself to death?
00:22:52.330,00:22:53.289,This is ridiculous.
00:22:53.331,00:22:54.623,"No, it's not!"
00:22:54.665,00:22:56.416,We talked about it a lot.
00:22:56.458,00:22:58.752,It's pretty much all you do in rehab.
00:22:58.794,00:23:02.131,Marco has clarity for the first time in his life.
00:23:02.173,00:23:03.841,He knows what makes him happy.
00:23:03.883,00:23:06.426,He knows his weaknesses.
00:23:06.468,00:23:09.763,He's not as strong as you think.
00:23:09.805,00:23:14.143,"And that's okay, but -- Marco cheated on you."
00:23:17.188,00:23:19.148,It was about a month ago.
00:23:19.190,00:23:22.568,He was overwhelmed with the wedding and the planning.
00:23:22.609,00:23:24.653,He ran into an ex-girlfriend.
00:23:24.695,00:23:26.780,It only happened once.
00:23:28.366,00:23:30.743,You're lying.
00:23:30.784,00:23:35.706,"You're upset that he had secrets from you, so -- No, she's not lying."
00:23:38.834,00:23:41.045,"Mija, he -- he was -- he was so upset."
00:23:41.087,00:23:42.296,He does love you.
00:23:42.338,00:23:44.382,"Okay, maybe we're digressing here a little bit."
00:23:44.422,00:23:46.008,And we really don't have the time.
00:23:46.050,00:23:48.886,It matters.
00:23:48.928,00:23:54.432,"She doesn't know him like -- maybe none of us do, but..."
00:23:54.474,00:23:59.521,"but we are his parents, and you're not his wife."
00:23:59.563,00:24:00.940,Yet.
00:24:16.914,00:24:18.498,Okay. Get the cops.
00:24:16.914,00:24:20.334,"Check everywhere -- other side of the road, bushes, trees."
00:24:20.376,00:24:23.963,"If she was ejected from the bus, she could be 40, 50 feet in any direction."
00:24:28.134,00:24:29.467,Claire: Jenna!
00:24:31.762,00:24:33.513,I found her!
00:24:41.188,00:24:42.189,"Okay, she's got a brain bleed."
00:24:42.231,00:24:44.233,We need to get her out of here now!
00:24:47.945,00:24:49.487,Dr. Andrews.
00:24:49.529,00:24:52.741,I think Celez may be eligible for an experimental bone treatment.
00:24:52.783,00:24:53.826,Sell it to me.
00:24:53.867,00:24:55.244,"Well, I've been doing some digging."
00:25:01.250,00:25:06.797,"Now -- Now, I know fish skins sound a bit crazy, but -- but I was thinking we could do the same thing here."
00:25:06.839,00:25:09.925,"Dr. Kalu, I applaud your thinking."
00:25:09.967,00:25:17.266,"But we -- Tilapia skins contain more collagen proteins -- both types 1 and 3 -- than even human skin, which aids in tissue repair, negating the need for grafts."
00:25:17.308,00:25:18.976,"It's shown to accelerate healing, would reduce..."
00:25:19.018,00:25:22.062,...the risk of infection and cut down on the patient's physical pain.
00:25:22.104,00:25:25.232,"Are you finished, or would you like to cut me off again?"
00:25:25.274,00:25:27.609,"Okay, let's follow this through, shall we?"
00:25:27.651,00:25:38.245,"You have to come up with a proposal for the experimental treatment, get it approved by our institutional review board, get your hands on medical-grade tilapia skins, and then we -- Well, I thought you could help expedite the process."
00:25:40.580,00:25:43.334,You think I could bring it down from three months to two hours?
00:25:45.044,00:25:47.463,You finish the debridement?
00:25:47.505,00:25:49.215,"Okay, I'll take over from here."
00:25:49.256,00:25:50.966,Okay.
00:25:51.008,00:25:52.968,Keep thinking outside the box.
00:25:53.010,00:25:54.761,Initiative is good.
00:26:04.480,00:26:06.148,I'm in. Bag her.
00:26:06.190,00:26:07.358,Did you get me the drill?
00:26:07.400,00:26:08.775,The fire truck had one.
00:26:08.817,00:26:09.818,Her pupil's blown.
00:26:09.860,00:26:12.696,"She has a subdural hematoma, causing increased intracranial pressure."
00:26:12.738,00:26:15.991,"If I don't alleviate it now, there's no way she makes it to the hospital alive."
00:26:41.100,00:26:43.018,Unconscious female.
00:26:43.060,00:26:44.686,I had to do a burr hole in field.
00:26:44.728,00:26:46.646,Her sats are in the low 70s.
00:26:55.239,00:26:57.241,She's good to go to the O.R.
00:26:58.700,00:27:00.286,Subdural hematoma?
00:27:00.327,00:27:02.371,"She had decerebrate posturing, a blown left pupil."
00:27:02.413,00:27:05.541,"When I passed the drill bit through her skull, a whole lot of blood pooled out."
00:27:05.583,00:27:06.959,Good call.
00:27:11.589,00:27:14.467,"Uh, San Diego Community Hospital called."
00:27:14.508,00:27:15.968,They're sending the tilapia skins.
00:27:16.009,00:27:17.595,They're medevacing them in.
00:27:17.635,00:27:19.721,Should be here within the hour.
00:27:19.763,00:27:21.807,Celez...
00:27:21.848,00:27:27.438,you meet the criteria for an experimental treatment that I think will prevent you from having to undergo skin grafts.
00:27:27.480,00:27:29.482,Hold up.
00:27:29.523,00:27:33.527,"Well, I found out San Diego's trial allows for multi-site collaborations."
00:27:33.569,00:27:35.737,"So, there's no need for us to get our own I.R.B."
00:27:35.779,00:27:38.865,"They give us the skins, we provide the patient data."
00:27:38.907,00:27:40.576,Fish skins?
00:27:40.618,00:27:42.995,The tilapia skins have been cleaned and sterilized.
00:27:43.036,00:27:45.289,They're perfectly safe.
00:27:48.666,00:27:49.960,You'll do it?
00:27:53.088,00:27:54.632,I'll do it.
00:27:56.758,00:27:58.927,"Andrews: Well done, Dr. Kalu."
00:27:58.969,00:28:00.596,Well done.
00:28:00.638,00:28:02.348,...so help you God?
00:28:02.389,00:28:04.558,Yes.
00:28:04.600,00:28:07.769,Dr. Melendez can tell you -- He has.
00:28:07.811,00:28:10.397,"But the fake femur is yours, though, right?"
00:28:10.439,00:28:12.941,How confident are you in its design?
00:28:12.983,00:28:15.361,"Shaun, she needs to know -- I know what she needs to know."
00:28:15.402,00:28:17.613,She needs to know will it work.
00:28:17.655,00:28:20.491,She needs to know how long it will last.
00:28:22.326,00:28:23.327,Yes.
00:28:23.369,00:28:24.786,Okay.
00:28:31.043,00:28:32.211,He's his doctor?
00:28:32.252,00:28:34.380,He is a surgical resident.
00:28:34.421,00:28:36.256,Is he going to answer my questions?
00:28:36.298,00:28:39.468,"Shaun, I really need you to focus."
00:28:45.307,00:28:47.393,"No, we already know the answer."
00:28:47.434,00:28:48.852,This thing has never been done before.
00:28:48.894,00:28:50.437,Be quiet!
00:28:57.861,00:29:00.780,His toes are changing color.
00:29:15.254,00:29:16.380,"Murphy, what do we got?"
00:29:16.422,00:29:19.341,It's restricting blood flow.
00:29:19.383,00:29:20.676,"All right, we need a decision now."
00:29:20.718,00:29:22.261,Are we cutting off the leg or replacing the bone?
00:29:22.302,00:29:28.601,"There's no doubt in my mind that Marco's parents and fiancée all love Marco, but it's become clear -- Now."
00:29:30.894,00:29:32.854,His parents know him as their child.
00:29:32.896,00:29:35.148,Sonia knows him as a man.
00:29:35.190,00:29:37.776,Replace the femur.
00:29:37.817,00:29:40.153,Let's go!
00:29:40.195,00:29:42.864,Thank you!
00:29:50.956,00:29:53.626,And there's the bleed.
00:29:53.667,00:29:56.795,You ever clip an intracranial artery before?
00:29:56.836,00:29:58.631,"No, sir."
00:29:58.672,00:29:59.923,Go for it.
00:30:07.640,00:30:14.187,"Just like every first time -- you're a little excited, a little nauseous."
00:30:14.229,00:30:16.856,Hopefully nobody gets hurt.
00:30:34.708,00:30:36.710,Is it good to go?
00:30:36.752,00:30:38.128,It's very good.
00:30:38.170,00:30:39.087,Forceps.
00:30:44.510,00:30:46.470,You ready?
00:30:46.512,00:30:47.846,Yes.
00:31:19.336,00:31:24.966,Be careful the clip blades don't catch any perforated arteries.
00:31:25.008,00:31:26.926,I don't seen any vessels in the way.
00:31:26.968,00:31:28.595,Then what are you waiting for?
00:31:33.933,00:31:35.101,Very nice.
00:31:35.143,00:31:36.228,Thank you.
00:31:40.440,00:31:41.567,Everything's dry.
00:31:41.608,00:31:43.527,Say goodbye and close the roof.
00:31:46.530,00:31:51.744,"We need to get blood back into his leg in the next minute or so, or I'm gonna have to amputate after all."
00:31:51.785,00:31:54.329,"Insulin's hanging, loaded him with calcium."
00:31:54.371,00:31:55.581,Best I can do.
00:31:55.622,00:31:56.998,Let's release the clamps.
00:31:59.543,00:32:01.461,Check for capillary refill.
00:32:14.224,00:32:16.976,Blood flow is restored.
00:32:17.018,00:32:19.229,EKG is normal.
00:32:21.481,00:32:26.069,"Okay. Kim, I want to hear words like variability and Delta."
00:32:26.111,00:32:27.654,Give them to me.
00:32:29.448,00:32:32.451,I'm waiting patiently.
00:32:32.492,00:32:35.245,I'm not getting anything.
00:32:35.287,00:32:36.747,Show me.
00:32:44.254,00:32:45.672,Claire: Check the leads.
00:32:52.763,00:32:54.514,Still nothing.
00:32:56.516,00:33:00.771,Her brain -- i-it could rewire itself.
00:33:00.813,00:33:02.355,No.
00:33:04.065,00:33:05.901,Zero brain activity.
00:33:05.943,00:33:07.402,"I don't know why, but she's gone."
00:33:25.504,00:33:27.631,What?
00:33:27.673,00:33:31.009,Your neurosurgery patient that died tonight -- there's something you should know.
00:33:31.050,00:33:32.469,What?
00:33:40.393,00:33:43.897,"Melendez: Now, Marco, I want you to try and move your toes."
00:33:54.282,00:33:55.617,I can't.
00:33:55.659,00:33:56.535,Is he okay?
00:33:56.576,00:33:58.745,We're not sure if the bone -- He's not gonna die?
00:34:00.747,00:34:02.666,"His body's not gonna reject -- No, no. We're monitoring him very closely."
00:34:02.708,00:34:04.710,The biggest threat is behind -- He moved.
00:34:05.502,00:34:06.962,He moved.
00:34:13.719,00:34:16.221,It worked.
00:34:16.262,00:34:19.808,You'll have a long recovery ahead -- months of physical therapy.
00:34:19.850,00:34:21.351,"But for now, all you have to do is rest."
00:34:21.393,00:34:23.061,Thank you.
00:34:23.102,00:34:27.816,Thank you for saving my life -- for saving my leg.
00:34:27.858,00:34:30.109,Thank you.
00:34:34.573,00:34:36.909,Are you ready to finish what we started?
00:34:38.785,00:34:41.496,Get well first.
00:34:41.538,00:34:43.540,There's plenty of time for a wedding.
00:34:51.965,00:34:53.926,Thank you.
00:34:53.967,00:34:55.176,Thank you.
00:35:02.684,00:35:03.894,You look good.
00:35:03.936,00:35:06.730,Tough.
00:35:09.232,00:35:12.402,Mm.
00:35:12.444,00:35:14.279,Everybody loves sushi.
00:35:15.781,00:35:17.115,It's only for six months.
00:35:17.156,00:35:19.409,Your new skin should have completely grown in by then.
00:35:19.451,00:35:22.161,Should have minor scarring.
00:35:22.203,00:35:23.622,Thank you.
00:35:25.874,00:35:27.751,I misjudged you.
00:35:29.461,00:35:31.504,You judged me just right.
00:35:43.558,00:35:45.936,Is she still sleeping?
00:35:45.978,00:35:47.062,You haven't told her yet?
00:35:49.481,00:35:52.025,Can I have a moment please?
00:35:52.067,00:35:53.568,Of course.
00:36:00.366,00:36:05.080,How soon after you found Jenna at the crash site did you intubate her?
00:36:05.122,00:36:06.915,Almost immediately.
00:36:06.957,00:36:08.750,I did a sternal rub.
00:36:08.792,00:36:10.376,"Uh, she had decerebrate posturing."
00:36:10.418,00:36:12.129,Her left pupil was blown.
00:36:12.170,00:36:16.675,"I knew she had a subdural hematoma, so I intubated, did the burr hole."
00:36:19.511,00:36:21.930,Did you check her breathing after you intubated her?
00:36:21.972,00:36:23.140,Yes.
00:36:25.517,00:36:28.020,"Well, at least I-I think I did."
00:36:30.188,00:36:36.153,"Dr. Lim told me that when Jenna came into the E.R., she wasn't ventilating properly."
00:36:36.194,00:36:43.160,You inserted the tube too deep into her right main stem bronchus of her injured lung.
00:36:43.201,00:36:49.332,We had no way of knowing how long she was hypoxic before we gave her the EEG.
00:36:59.384,00:37:08.852,"I drilled a perfect burr hole into her skull on the side of the road in the middle of the night, and I-I-I screw up her intubation?"
00:37:08.894,00:37:13.023,Yes. It was tough conditions for anyone -- resident or not.
00:37:13.065,00:37:15.650,Any one of us could have made the same mistake.
00:37:30.373,00:37:33.210,I had a woman come into the E.R. once...
00:37:34.669,00:37:37.923,"...a mother, 51 years old."
00:37:37.964,00:37:40.550,Francine Parker.
00:37:40.592,00:37:42.802,She had two boys.
00:37:42.844,00:37:49.226,She had a cough -- a bad one -- but a cough.
00:37:49.267,00:37:52.062,"I checked her out, gave her some antibiotics, sent her home."
00:37:52.104,00:37:55.899,"Six hours later, she was rolled into the E.R."
00:37:55.941,00:37:59.903,"She had had a heart attack, and I missed it, and..."
00:37:59.945,00:38:01.613,she died.
00:38:04.282,00:38:09.829,Not one day...goes by when I don't think about her.
00:38:11.915,00:38:15.168,She was your first.
00:38:15.210,00:38:17.670,"My fourth, actually."
00:38:20.048,00:38:23.051,You're not gonna forget this.
00:38:25.470,00:38:31.059,"But I don't know, maybe we're better off for it the next time around."
00:38:31.101,00:38:33.352,You got to find a way to keep going.
00:38:36.689,00:38:38.858,Yeah.
00:38:38.900,00:38:41.611,Go home.
00:38:41.653,00:38:43.071,I haven't even told her yet.
00:38:43.113,00:38:44.405,You're not going to.
00:38:48.534,00:38:54.707,I'm not gonna allow you to talk to the family or anyone else outside this hospital about this.
00:38:56.334,00:38:59.171,Do we understand each other?
00:38:59.212,00:39:00.797,"Yes, sir."
00:39:34.706,00:39:38.043,I called San Diego Community Hospital and thanked them for including us in their study.
00:39:38.084,00:39:40.586,They said they were happy to do it.
00:39:40.628,00:39:48.136,And they asked that I pass along their thanks to you for your very generous donation to their burn unit.
00:39:52.724,00:39:54.267,I know you come from a wealthy family.
00:39:54.309,00:39:56.686,"I don't begrudge that, but you..."
00:39:56.728,00:40:01.524,can't open your wallet every time a patient's in need.
00:40:01.566,00:40:04.819,The lines can get real blurry real fast.
00:40:07.405,00:40:09.366,"Yes, sir."
00:40:41.606,00:40:43.275,What's this?
00:40:45.318,00:40:47.070,"Jess, nothing's gonna happen."
00:40:47.112,00:40:50.240,Really?
00:41:11.136,00:41:14.431,"Well, that was quite a night."
00:41:14.472,00:41:20.437,Been a doctor for a long while -- don't remember a night quite like that one.
00:41:20.478,00:41:23.606,Why did Nurse Farrar ask if I wanted love?
00:41:23.648,00:41:25.650,'Cause she's a nosy...
00:41:28.653,00:41:31.281,"Shaun, you really don't want love?"
00:41:31.323,00:41:34.784,I loved Steve and my rabbit.
00:41:34.826,00:41:36.619,Not anymore.
00:41:36.661,00:41:39.122,You don't love them anymore?
00:41:39.164,00:41:41.958,"No, I don't."
00:41:42.000,00:41:45.837,You can't love someone if they're dead.
00:41:45.878,00:41:49.257,"Well, I've lost people I love."
00:41:49.299,00:41:52.218,"I miss them, and it hurts, but I still love them."
00:41:58.308,00:42:00.185,I don't want love.
00:42:04.689,00:42:06.024,Okay.
00:42:09.735,00:42:13.323,You want breakfast?
00:42:13.365,00:42:16.117,Can I have four pancakes instead of three?
00:42:16.159,00:42:17.576,You can have five.
00:42:17.618,00:42:19.662,I only want four.
00:42:19.704,00:42:21.873,Okay.
00:42:21.914,00:42:24.376,Okay.
00:00:24.441,00:00:26.694,Come on.
00:00:26.735,00:00:28.069,Worked fine for me.
00:00:28.111,00:00:30.238,I don't have time for this.
00:00:30.280,00:00:31.198,How you doing?
00:00:31.239,00:00:33.074,The computer is not working.
00:00:33.116,00:00:35.160,That's not what I'm talking about.
00:00:35.202,00:00:37.120,I know. I'm fine.
00:00:37.162,00:00:40.040,A patient died because of something you did.
00:00:40.081,00:00:43.794,I think it's safe to say the one thing you are not is fine.
00:00:43.836,00:00:44.962,I'm dealing.
00:00:45.004,00:00:47.255,How exactly are you dealing?
00:00:47.297,00:00:54.513,"I'm getting back to work, I have a diabetic toe to debride, and I'm putting it behind me."
00:00:54.555,00:00:58.517,How do you do that -- put it behind you?
00:00:58.559,00:01:00.644,By moving forward.
00:01:00.686,00:01:02.855,I appreciate your concern.
00:01:02.897,00:01:06.274,I'm gonna make an appointment for you for grief counseling.
00:01:06.316,00:01:13.866,Dr. Mohan -- She's an expert in dealing with hospital staff who have experienced stressful events.
00:01:13.908,00:01:15.826,That's not necessary.
00:01:15.868,00:01:19.329,You agree you had a stressful event?
00:01:19.371,00:01:26.921,"And while I am comforted by your commitment to move forward by not looking back, I still want you to see Dr. Mohan."
00:01:26.962,00:01:31.592,"If she says that you are fine, then -- and only then -- can you go back to surgery."
00:01:31.633,00:01:33.552,It's working now.
00:01:33.594,00:01:35.930,You just have to be patient.
00:01:41.685,00:01:43.311,Heart rate 36.
00:01:43.353,00:01:45.522,Push another five milligrams of morphine and prep a nitro drip.
00:01:45.564,00:01:47.441,We need atropine on board stat.
00:01:47.482,00:01:50.069,What do you got for me?
00:01:50.110,00:01:53.781,"He's had aspirin, nitro, and now we're trying to give him a real rate with atropine."
00:01:53.822,00:01:54.782,Cardiology see him?
00:01:54.823,00:02:00.662,"He's got a broken pacemaker and probably needs his coronary arteries cleared -- feels like a triple bypass, but you're the expert."
00:02:00.704,00:02:03.540,BNP is sky high.
00:02:03.582,00:02:05.042,What do you see?
00:02:05.084,00:02:07.836,are barely pumping.
00:02:07.878,00:02:10.297,He's had two massive prior MIs.
00:02:10.338,00:02:12.091,End stage heart failure.
00:02:12.132,00:02:13.759,His heart's way beyond repair.
00:02:13.801,00:02:14.927,What are our options?
00:02:14.969,00:02:16.344,He's 73 years old.
00:02:16.386,00:02:18.931,His age is an absolute contraindication for transplant.
00:02:18.973,00:02:21.266,He's dying.
00:02:21.308,00:02:22.434,What else?
00:02:22.476,00:02:24.185,How about cardiac resynchronization?
00:02:24.227,00:02:27.022,That will get what's left of both ventricles working together.
00:02:27.064,00:02:28.148,A biventricular pacer?
00:02:28.189,00:02:31.652,It should make him feel a little better he's got left.
00:02:35.114,00:02:37.658,"Claire, prep his jugular to float in a temporary pacemaker."
00:02:37.699,00:02:42.079,"Shaun, call up to the cath lab and have them get an estimate on how long it'll take to get the bi-pacer in house."
00:02:49.628,00:02:50.838,Something wrong?
00:02:50.879,00:02:52.089,"Um, not at all."
00:02:52.131,00:02:53.799,Just a little bit too much coffee this morning.
00:02:53.841,00:02:55.550,Let's go. Do it now.
00:03:06.394,00:03:07.521,"Restraints, please!"
00:03:07.562,00:03:09.148,I don't want to get stuck with a needle.
00:03:15.362,00:03:17.280,You're scaring him.
00:03:23.704,00:03:24.955,You're scaring him.
00:03:24.997,00:03:27.124,"Nurse: Haldol, five milligrams."
00:03:27.166,00:03:28.625,You're scaring him!
00:03:28.667,00:03:30.502,Who are you?
00:03:30.544,00:03:32.713,"This patient is psychotic, Dr. Murphy."
00:03:32.754,00:03:34.965,He's not psychotic.
00:03:36.508,00:03:39.553,You don't like people touching you.
00:03:41.889,00:03:45.142,He's not psychotic.
00:03:47.186,00:04:04.411,-- Captions by VITAC -- Shaun: You're being an excellent patient.
00:04:06.454,00:04:08.749,Okay. We're finished.
00:04:08.790,00:04:12.127,You're s-same as...
00:04:12.169,00:04:14.629,me.
00:04:14.671,00:04:17.758,Can we release his hands?
00:04:17.799,00:04:21.220,Dr. Murphy? His hands?
00:04:21.261,00:04:24.305,"I'm here, son -- Mom and Dad are here."
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.975,You can let go of his hands.
00:04:30.771,00:04:33.857,Wrong stop.
00:04:33.899,00:04:35.442,Can someone tell me what happened?
00:04:35.483,00:04:41.698,"Liam has a 5.4 centimeter laceration on his forehead, probably from a fall."
00:04:41.740,00:04:46.411,The wound was infiltrated with five milliliters of 1% lidocaine...
00:04:46.453,00:04:52.042,7 -- 7 single-interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures.
00:04:52.084,00:04:55.420,"He will a small scar, but no other long-term effects from this injury."
00:04:55.462,00:04:57.131,You're my son's doctor.
00:04:57.172,00:05:00.926,I am. Dr. Shaun Murphy -- Shaun with a U.
00:05:00.968,00:05:03.971,"Got lost -- got lost, got lost, got lost, got lost!"
00:05:04.012,00:05:07.015,"Yes, yes. Yes."
00:05:08.267,00:05:09.851,You won't be taking that bus again.
00:05:09.893,00:05:11.352,Don: This light is too bright.
00:05:11.394,00:05:13.688,These rooms make him anxious.
00:05:13.730,00:05:14.982,No.
00:05:15.023,00:05:19.694,"Your son is jaundiced, clenching his right abdominal muscles when touched and febrile."
00:05:19.736,00:05:20.946,He should not go home.
00:05:31.999,00:05:33.792,Why am I here?
00:05:33.834,00:05:36.128,Your pacemaker malfunctioned.
00:05:36.170,00:05:37.587,You had a heart attack.
00:05:37.629,00:05:40.465,I...I think I get that part.
00:05:41.633,00:05:48.098,"Your neighbor's gardener saw you on the ground inside your house -- called 911, saved your life."
00:05:48.140,00:05:53.020,"Well, I must remember to thank him."
00:05:53.979,00:05:57.149,How old are you?
00:05:58.357,00:06:00.944,I know how old I am.
00:06:00.986,00:06:03.238,I'm 28.
00:06:03.280,00:06:08.618,"We have, uh, a biventricular pacer on its way, and it's gonna make you feel a lot better."
00:06:08.660,00:06:10.954,Is it?
00:06:12.789,00:06:15.750,I will be back to prep you for surgery.
00:06:17.044,00:06:21.631,"Liam has elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, a white cell count of 23."
00:06:21.673,00:06:26.136,Abdominal ultrasound shows dilatation of the bile ducts.
00:06:26.178,00:06:31.808,Sounds like ascending cholangitis -- can lead to sepsis if the bacteria gain access to his blood.
00:06:31.850,00:06:33.018,Is he stable now?
00:06:33.060,00:06:35.270,"Yes, his vital signs are stable."
00:06:35.312,00:06:41.068,"Cause could be anything from cancer to diet, so -- Liam's parents have him on a special ketogenic diet."
00:06:41.109,00:06:45.155,"High-fat diets can cause obstructive gallstones, which could have set the whole thing off."
00:06:45.197,00:06:46.823,Do an ERCP to clear him.
00:06:46.865,00:06:50.369,"After that, a few weeks of broad spectrum antibiotics should take care of things."
00:07:13.308,00:07:15.643,Shaun: I want you help.
00:07:15.685,00:07:18.688,With what?
00:07:18.730,00:07:21.358,Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography.
00:07:21.400,00:07:25.404,ERCP? Why?
00:07:25.445,00:07:27.488,"You've done those before, Shaun."
00:07:27.530,00:07:30.992,You're good with people who have autism.
00:07:35.496,00:07:42.421,"Okay, Glen, let's get this, star...ted Glen, you almost finished?"
00:07:44.798,00:07:47.968,It's Dr. Kalu.
00:08:01.148,00:08:02.441,"Yeah, we have a code green."
00:08:02.482,00:08:05.485,"Patient is Caucasian, male, 185 pounds."
00:08:15.787,00:08:17.664,"Shaun, can you talk to him or something?"
00:08:17.705,00:08:19.291,I can't push the Midazolam.
00:08:23.337,00:08:25.713,Four lights...four doors.
00:08:25.755,00:08:27.507,Yes. Lots of things.
00:08:27.548,00:08:31.886,"32 and 8. 32, 8."
00:08:31.928,00:08:36.975,"32 is the number of cabinet windows, and 8 is the number of handles."
00:08:40.228,00:08:42.147,"Hmm, the end title's CO2 is rising."
00:08:42.189,00:08:44.732,He needs oxygen.
00:08:44.774,00:08:47.902,It's a common reaction to Midazolam.
00:08:52.699,00:08:54.868,CO2 is coming down.
00:08:54.909,00:08:57.496,"You can proceed, Claire."
00:09:05.337,00:09:09.299,Have you been around a lot of other autistic people?
00:09:09.341,00:09:11.218,I've never met someone with autism.
00:09:11.259,00:09:12.677,Oh.
00:09:12.719,00:09:15.055,"So, it must be nice to spend some time around Liam, then."
00:09:16.681,00:09:20.268,Why would that be nice?
00:09:20.310,00:09:23.646,Okay.
00:09:23.688,00:09:26.441,There are no stones.
00:09:26.483,00:09:28.818,Where are the stones?
00:09:28.860,00:09:30.778,And there is scarring.
00:09:30.820,00:09:33.407,This has nothing to do with gallstones.
00:09:33.448,00:09:38.745,The entire biliary tree is so thick with scarring we can't even get the camera through.
00:09:44.000,00:09:56.388,"The differential diagnosis for biliary tree scarring includes primary sclerosing cholangitis, liver failure, secondary to primary biliary cirrhosis -- Yeah, Shaun, we can add a few cancers to that list as well -- It's a long and ugly one."
00:09:56.430,00:09:58.806,Find another way to figure out what it is.
00:09:58.848,00:10:00.016,We could do an MRI.
00:10:00.058,00:10:03.603,"No, we couldn't."
00:10:03.644,00:10:04.938,It's not possible.
00:10:04.979,00:10:06.356,That's the first time I've ever heard you say that.
00:10:08.024,00:10:11.194,The tics and spasms are a neurological response to stress.
00:10:11.236,00:10:16.533,"If he's doing an MRI, there is stress -- if there is stress, he won't keep still, if he wont' keep still, we can't do an MRI."
00:10:16.575,00:10:17.825,"Therefore, it is impossible."
00:10:17.867,00:10:22.539,"Maybe if you just keep talking to him like that, he'll doze off and it'll all be simple."
00:10:22.581,00:10:24.165,Give him a mild sedative.
00:10:24.207,00:10:28.044,He didn't respond well to Midazolam during ERCP -- depresses his breathing.
00:10:28.086,00:10:31.965,His respiratory saturation can't be properly monitored inside -- I get it.
00:10:32.006,00:10:33.592,He could die in the MRI and we wouldn't know.
00:10:33.633,00:10:35.469,You're just gonna have to find a different way to calm him.
00:10:35.510,00:10:37.554,Okay. We'll do it.
00:10:37.596,00:10:38.763,Guess he has an idea.
00:10:41.308,00:10:42.767,Loudspeaker: We have a code green.
00:10:42.809,00:10:46.646,"Patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age."
00:10:48.565,00:10:50.733,"Shaun, what are you doing?"
00:10:50.775,00:10:52.360,Counting.
00:10:52.402,00:10:54.279,Counting what?
00:10:54.321,00:10:56.448,Why?
00:10:56.490,00:10:59.993,"I want $1,643."
00:11:00.034,00:11:01.786,You can get that by counting?
00:11:01.828,00:11:06.166,That's why you're alone and pacing in this room?
00:11:06.207,00:11:07.542,What do you want the money for?
00:11:07.584,00:11:10.629,I want to buy a television.
00:11:13.256,00:11:15.674,You're not a surgeon yet.
00:11:15.716,00:11:18.386,"Ah, there's a big difference in the paycheck there, pal."
00:11:18.428,00:11:20.555,"I'm not a child, pal."
00:11:22.307,00:11:24.434,"How 'bout $1,000 for a television?"
00:11:24.476,00:11:27.395,"No. The one I want is $1,643, okay?"
00:11:27.437,00:11:29.230,"I know, but you have a budget."
00:11:29.272,00:11:33.401,A budget.
00:11:44.120,00:11:47.624,"These are live feeds -- entrances, E.R., receiving dock."
00:11:47.666,00:11:49.250,"If your patient had left, we would've seen it."
00:11:49.292,00:11:50.709,Then where'd he go?
00:11:50.751,00:11:54.255,"A freight elevator, but we don't have cams in the freights, and he doesn't pop back up."
00:11:54.297,00:11:59.010,"So, we're dealing with an alien abduction here?"
00:12:00.303,00:12:01.762,Sorry.
00:12:01.804,00:12:05.642,"We don't have cams on the freight elevators on levels one, four and five, and the basement."
00:12:05.684,00:12:07.227,And you got people looking on those floors?
00:12:07.268,00:12:09.187,"We've covered four and five, and we're moving on to one."
00:12:35.630,00:12:38.550,Hey.
00:12:39.634,00:12:40.635,What's in the basement?
00:12:41.886,00:12:45.098,Pediatric patient lost a blanket -- I'm just gonna check lost and found.
00:12:45.139,00:12:47.766,That's nice of you.
00:12:49.686,00:12:54.649,"While you're there, you might want to check if they found your code green."
00:13:07.328,00:13:10.582,"Uh, this is Doctor..."
00:13:12.417,00:13:14.711,I an hear you when you speak.
00:13:14.753,00:13:17.589,I was thinking about something.
00:13:17.631,00:13:23.428,There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.
00:13:24.845,00:13:28.516,Please turn down the lights.
00:13:29.726,00:13:34.606,There are 24 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.
00:13:35.482,00:13:41.820,There are 22 steps from the ambulance to the E.R.
00:13:41.862,00:13:44.073,He has very long strides.
00:13:44.115,00:13:45.617,Yes.
00:13:56.503,00:14:01.633,There are 37 steps from the elevator to room 405.
00:14:01.675,00:14:09.056,There are 37 steps from the elevator to room 405.
00:14:09.098,00:14:13.852,"In room 405, there are 6 steps to the sink..."
00:14:13.894,00:14:16.063,6 steps to the sink.
00:14:16.105,00:14:18.608,Claire: We're getting good images.
00:14:18.650,00:14:23.988,It's amazing how accomplished you are for someone with ASD.
00:14:24.030,00:14:26.073,Three steps to the window.
00:14:26.115,00:14:29.661,Three steps to -- Three...
00:14:31.996,00:14:35.958,It's seven steps -- It's seven steps to the door.
00:14:36.000,00:14:39.253,"Liam, there are seven steps to the door."
00:14:40.880,00:14:41.922,You need to get him out.
00:14:41.964,00:14:43.550,Just a little more time.
00:14:43.591,00:14:45.426,He's scared.
00:14:45.468,00:14:47.679,"Seven -- You're doing wonderfully, honey."
00:14:47.721,00:14:51.558,Just breathe.
00:15:19.627,00:15:21.755,Glen?
00:15:27.176,00:15:29.262,Glen?
00:15:34.434,00:15:35.935,Glen?
00:15:40.648,00:15:42.149,Glen?
00:15:42.191,00:15:44.944,It's Dr. Kalu.
00:15:44.985,00:15:46.571,Let's get you upstairs.
00:15:46.613,00:15:47.572,Go away.
00:15:47.614,00:15:49.699,We're gonna get your new pacer in.
00:15:49.741,00:15:53.160,Don't you get it?
00:15:53.202,00:15:56.831,I broke my pacer on purpose.
00:15:56.873,00:15:59.166,I want to die.
00:16:08.175,00:16:10.344,"With a new pacemaker, maybe you'll feel better."
00:16:10.386,00:16:12.472,"So, I'll be cured?"
00:16:12.513,00:16:13.932,Good as new?
00:16:13.973,00:16:15.349,Heh.
00:16:15.391,00:16:19.437,"Well, it'll reduce your pain, and then hopefully -- You think this is the first time I've heard that?"
00:16:19.479,00:16:21.731,It's always the next best thing.
00:16:24.400,00:16:28.571,The truth is I'll just keep getting worse.
00:16:28.613,00:16:30.615,"I know it, you know it."
00:16:30.657,00:16:32.325,Do you have any family you can talk to?
00:16:32.366,00:16:35.620,Brother's dead.
00:16:40.374,00:16:42.710,We have great counseling services here.
00:16:42.752,00:16:46.923,"I'm in pain, 28 -- all the time."
00:16:46.965,00:16:49.717,Talk therapy gonna talk that away?
00:16:49.759,00:16:51.051,Let's get you upstairs.
00:16:51.093,00:16:55.849,"You color's not good, and your lungs are crackling, which means there's fluid building in -- I know my..."
00:16:55.890,00:16:57.224,I know my rights.
00:16:57.266,00:17:00.394,I don't have to get treatment if I don't want it.
00:17:00.436,00:17:06.860,"The minute I catch my breath, I'm gonna walk out of here, so you can just leave."
00:17:14.325,00:17:16.076,I'm not leaving.
00:17:28.548,00:17:30.717,We can't treat it until we find the underlying cause.
00:17:30.758,00:17:32.134,How do you do that?
00:17:32.176,00:17:35.262,Surgically -- It's called exploratory laparoscopy.
00:17:35.304,00:17:38.766,We use a camera to navigate Liam's midsection.
00:17:38.808,00:17:46.065,"There are significant risks -- perforation of an organ, accidental spread seeding malignancy."
00:17:46.106,00:17:49.819,And you have to do this because he can't stay still during an MRI?
00:17:49.861,00:17:51.863,You obviously know your son better than I do.
00:17:51.905,00:17:53.364,Do you think we should try again?
00:18:14.260,00:18:18.472,"So, Shaun told me he's getting a TV -- 70 inches, all the works."
00:18:18.514,00:18:19.849,Is he now?
00:18:19.891,00:18:21.183,It's just a TV.
00:18:21.225,00:18:22.602,It's not about a TV.
00:18:22.643,00:18:24.395,Why are you so worried about him?
00:18:24.437,00:18:32.987,"He showed up late for work half a dozen times, he calls me 2:00 in the morning 'cause he can't find a screwdriver, and his superintendent wants to kick him out of his building."
00:18:33.029,00:18:34.405,Did you show up?
00:18:39.493,00:18:40.494,He was frantic.
00:18:40.536,00:18:42.413,I didn't know what he was gonna do.
00:18:42.455,00:18:48.711,"There are 47 residents here, and all of them show up late sometimes, all of them make mistakes, and hopefully, all of them learn."
00:18:48.753,00:18:51.297,"If you want to worry about Shaun, fine."
00:18:51.338,00:18:55.217,But you fought to hire him because you know he can learn.
00:19:09.107,00:19:10.108,Shaun?
00:19:12.902,00:19:15.947,That's great. Listen -- It's not great.
00:19:15.989,00:19:17.740,"Mm, it's not good."
00:19:17.782,00:19:22.578,"On a high-quality display, the human eye at 20/20 cannot detect the pixels."
00:19:29.418,00:19:30.962,I failed.
00:19:31.004,00:19:35.008,"Yeah, see, I don't think it's about that."
00:19:35.049,00:19:38.218,You were hesitant with this kid even before that.
00:19:38.260,00:19:41.555,You asked me to the ERCP.
00:19:41.597,00:19:45.018,"Doctors don't have to like their patients, Claire."
00:19:46.185,00:19:48.354,You don't like him?
00:19:48.395,00:19:50.940,"Shaun, there's something else going on here."
00:19:50.982,00:19:54.694,I know you know that.
00:19:54.735,00:19:56.904,He has the same condition you have.
00:19:56.946,00:20:01.742,You have never met anyone with -- Do you like all people with psoriasis?
00:20:04.620,00:20:06.122,"Yes, you do."
00:20:06.164,00:20:08.457,And you can never get rid of it.
00:20:08.499,00:20:09.416,Okay.
00:20:09.458,00:20:14.254,"It's too bad you don't like him, because I think he likes you."
00:20:16.549,00:20:18.885,So you know how he thinks?
00:20:18.926,00:20:22.180,"Well, not as much as you probably do."
00:20:27.977,00:20:30.938,What are you waiting for?
00:20:30.980,00:20:34.483,For you to pass out.
00:20:34.525,00:20:36.986,Judging by the size your ankles...
00:20:40.198,00:20:43.283,Then hopefully I can get you upstairs before you die.
00:20:43.325,00:20:46.913,Why do you give such a damn about what I do with my life?
00:20:46.954,00:20:49.582,"I don't know, Glen."
00:20:49.623,00:20:52.960,Why'd you want to die so bad?
00:20:57.131,00:20:59.466,I've lived.
00:21:05.514,00:21:10.269,"Had a good roof over my head, and I've had that good roof taken away from me."
00:21:10.310,00:21:14.232,"I loved a girl, and I got married."
00:21:14.314,00:21:19.028,The 20 happiest years of my life...
00:21:19.070,00:21:21.948,then she died.
00:21:28.621,00:21:33.709,Feels like the end of the story.
00:21:36.378,00:21:37.630,I understand.
00:21:37.671,00:21:39.715,Yeah?
00:21:39.757,00:21:44.137,"You've had some tough times, too, 28?"
00:21:44.178,00:21:50.851,Nobody understands what it's like to be so good-looking and successful?
00:21:50.893,00:21:53.187,I was raised by nannies and housekeepers.
00:21:53.229,00:21:54.772,"Oh, my God."
00:21:54.814,00:21:56.107,You're an ass.
00:21:56.149,00:22:04.824,Your point is you didn't suffer because you were good-looking and smart -- you suffered because you were rich?
00:22:06.450,00:22:08.535,The only time I ever saw my parents was Christmas.
00:22:08.577,00:22:11.705,"Seriously, the story continues?"
00:22:11.747,00:22:17.128,"They had this big party every year, and wherever they were traveling they'd always fly home for it."
00:22:17.170,00:22:23.884,"And I'd have to come home, too, from whatever school they sent me off to."
00:22:23.926,00:22:28.597,"When I was 18, I decided that I was fed up."
00:22:28.639,00:22:32.476,"I was a man, done being their son."
00:22:34.478,00:22:40.358,"And I was gonna tell them publicly, tell all their friends what horrible people they were."
00:22:40.400,00:22:45.948,"So I came home from school, and I knocked on the door, and someone answered."
00:22:45.990,00:22:49.118,But it wasn't my parents.
00:22:49.160,00:22:52.121,Turns out they'd sold the house months ago.
00:22:52.163,00:22:54.372,They were gone.
00:22:56.625,00:22:58.794,"I guess they were done with me, too."
00:23:07.385,00:23:11.307,"To prep Liam for the laparoscopy, we need to make four small incisions in his stomach."
00:23:11.349,00:23:12.892,I don't need to do it.
00:23:12.933,00:23:14.352,I-I don't need to do it.
00:23:14.392,00:23:16.354,"Liam, you do need to."
00:23:16.394,00:23:17.897,"If you could just hold still for a second, Liam."
00:23:17.938,00:23:19.732,The -- the bus driver lets me off.
00:23:22.235,00:23:23.569,I get lost. I'm hungry.
00:23:23.610,00:23:24.737,I can't make food.
00:23:24.778,00:23:27.907,C-C-Can't do bath -- Don't need to do it!
00:23:27.948,00:23:31.911,C-C-Can't do food -- C-Can't put on clothes.
00:23:31.952,00:23:32.828,Can't do bus.
00:23:32.870,00:23:35.289,I took the bus.
00:23:37.250,00:23:41.795,"I got off at the wrong stop, and I got scared, but then I found my way."
00:23:48.928,00:23:53.057,I made a mistake.
00:23:56.143,00:23:58.271,You tried to walk.
00:23:58.312,00:24:00.606,You made a mistake.
00:24:00.647,00:24:05.194,But mistakes are good.
00:24:05.236,00:24:06.737,You're like me.
00:24:15.495,00:24:18.456,You have red eyes -- uveitis.
00:24:18.498,00:24:21.961,Liam takes vitamins -- Does Liam also take herbal supplements?
00:24:22.002,00:24:24.462,Kava root. Why?
00:24:24.504,00:24:26.548,He doesn't need the laparoscopic surgery.
00:24:26.590,00:24:28.759,I know what's wrong with him.
00:24:28.801,00:24:35.724,"The red eyes -- they're caused by an immune flare-up, which can create the scarring that we're seeing in his digestive system."
00:24:35.766,00:24:39.770,The solution requires us to go in and remove damaged segments of the bowel piece by piece.
00:24:39.812,00:24:40.854,Us?
00:24:40.896,00:24:43.023,"Yes, myself and my team."
00:24:43.065,00:24:44.608,Is Dr. Murphy on your team?
00:24:44.650,00:24:46.735,Of course.
00:24:46.777,00:24:51.282,Thank you for diagnosing our son.
00:24:51.324,00:24:59.206,"Dr. Melendez, you have our permission to do the surgery, but in no way will Dr. Murphy be in it."
00:25:10.009,00:25:11.218,"Well, the parents -- they won't budge."
00:25:11.260,00:25:13.595,They don't believe that anyone who has autism is capable do doing surgery.
00:25:13.637,00:25:16.182,"Well, clearly they're irrational -- I don't know -- shallow-minded people."
00:25:16.223,00:25:17.515,Who cares?
00:25:17.557,00:25:19.977,"You agree with them, right?"
00:25:20.019,00:25:21.687,Do you agree with them?
00:25:21.728,00:25:25.816,"It's my team -- I don't want anybody telling me who's supposed to be on my team, including the Board."
00:25:25.858,00:25:27.109,You're not answering my question.
00:25:27.151,00:25:30.029,The question's moot.
00:25:30.070,00:25:34.700,"If you agree with them, then the only issue is somebody stepping on your poor, little toes."
00:25:34.741,00:25:36.494,Get over it and go save the kid.
00:25:36.534,00:25:40.247,"If you don't agree, if you think Shaun can handle surgery, then tell them that."
00:25:40.289,00:25:42.500,Tell them to go screw themselves.
00:25:42.540,00:25:50.174,"Either they agree that Dr. Murphy belongs in that room with you, or you can go find them someplace else to do the surgery."
00:25:57.473,00:26:00.684,I was an 18-year-old with no one and no money.
00:26:00.726,00:26:04.063,So I worked three jobs and took out loans.
00:26:15.824,00:26:19.453,"That's not a bad story, 28."
00:26:19.495,00:26:23.123,What happened with the parents?
00:26:23.165,00:26:26.502,"I talk to them now, but..."
00:26:26.544,00:26:28.837,they're not the people who got me here.
00:26:28.879,00:26:40.307,"It was the people I didn't expect -- the ex-Marine at the shelter who got me my first job, and this crazy artist girl who convinced me to go after what I really wanted."
00:26:41.725,00:26:45.396,"When you think you're alone, Glen, you're not."
00:26:56.949,00:26:59.535,All right.
00:26:59.577,00:27:01.870,All right?
00:27:07.000,00:27:08.168,Ready?
00:27:08.210,00:27:09.587,"Two, three!"
00:27:11.171,00:27:14.925,No disturbing dreams?
00:27:14.967,00:27:19.888,"my head hits the pillow to the moment wake up, all I see is black."
00:27:19.930,00:27:22.975,Hm. How's your level of concentration?
00:27:24.726,00:27:29.607,"I mean, I can do the New York Times crossword puzzle in one sitting."
00:27:31.942,00:27:35.488,"Sure, sometimes I wish I was more focused."
00:27:35.529,00:27:37.906,"It's pretty normal, right?"
00:27:41.327,00:27:43.412,Shaun's different.
00:27:43.454,00:27:45.205,He also has savant syndrome.
00:27:45.247,00:27:47.166,He has a remarkable memory.
00:27:47.207,00:27:51.629,"He has autism, same as our son -- same limitations."
00:27:51.669,00:27:56.509,"Don: You saw what happened to our son in the MRI -- he knew he needed to lie still, but he couldn't."
00:27:56.550,00:28:02.598,"Now, what happens if Dr. Murphy breaks down like that while he's standing over my son at an operating table?"
00:28:02.640,00:28:05.058,You know your son.
00:28:05.100,00:28:07.353,I know surgeons.
00:28:07.394,00:28:19.615,"And after working with Dr. Murphy, after challenging him in surgery and everywhere else -- probably more than he deserved -- I can tell you he has my compete confidence."
00:28:26.455,00:28:28.207,I'm sorry.
00:28:28.248,00:28:30.626,He doesn't have ours.
00:28:30.668,00:28:33.671,"So, what do we do now?"
00:28:33.711,00:28:39.134,"I've contacted my colleague at St. Joseph's, updated her on Liam's condition."
00:28:39.176,00:28:40.802,They have good people.
00:28:40.844,00:28:43.681,We can arrange for transportation as soon as possible.
00:28:43.722,00:28:46.141,Where's my phone?
00:28:46.183,00:28:48.977,"Where's his second bag, the one with his medications?"
00:28:49.019,00:28:52.022,I want...
00:28:52.064,00:28:55.025,I want...
00:28:55.067,00:28:56.818,"What, honey?"
00:28:56.860,00:29:00.155,He said I could do it.
00:29:00.197,00:29:03.158,I want Dr. Shaun.
00:29:09.748,00:29:10.790,Your pacemaker's here.
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.626,The techs are programming it as we speak.
00:29:12.668,00:29:14.961,"The moment they're ready, we're gonna put it in."
00:29:26.973,00:29:31.604,I told you my wife died.
00:29:44.450,00:29:53.375,We all make -- But you didn't get what you deserved -- good parents who loved you.
00:29:53.417,00:29:57.421,"They were lucky to have you, Jared."
00:30:12.686,00:30:14.772,You appear remarkably well-adjusted.
00:30:14.813,00:30:15.731,Thank you.
00:30:15.773,00:30:17.065,That's not a compliment.
00:30:17.107,00:30:19.526,That's my concern.
00:30:22.571,00:30:27.242,The thing is everyone responds.
00:30:27.284,00:30:36.042,"Strictly speaking, you don't meet the criteria to be required to go into treatment or take a leave of absence, so I'm not gonna ground you."
00:30:39.963,00:30:47.721,"You're a strong woman, Claire, and that strength has undoubtedly played a major role in getting you where you are."
00:30:47.763,00:30:54.102,"But if you have suppressed feelings about this incident, you need to find someone to share them with."
00:30:54.144,00:30:59.483,"Because if not, they will eat you up no matter how strong you are."
00:31:05.238,00:31:08.283,"All right, Glen."
00:31:05.238,00:31:12.204,"Second ti-- Oh, come on."
00:31:16.500,00:31:19.961,Thank you.
00:31:20.003,00:31:22.005,It should be a very interesting surgery.
00:31:22.047,00:31:23.423,I'm glad I'm participating.
00:31:26.301,00:31:27.886,His pressure is bottoming out.
00:31:27.927,00:31:28.887,What's happening?
00:31:28.928,00:31:30.639,His bowel must have perforated.
00:31:30.681,00:31:33.350,He's going into septic shock.
00:31:37.896,00:31:39.105,This perforation could be anywhere.
00:31:39.147,00:31:41.191,What's the best way to access the entire bowel as quickly as possible?
00:31:41.233,00:31:42.735,Full-length midline incision.
00:31:42.776,00:31:43.861,Good. Mark it.
00:31:43.902,00:31:45.571,And what do we do once we get in there?
00:31:45.612,00:31:49.616,Eviscerate the entire bowel so we can check every inch for necrotic segments.
00:31:57.123,00:31:58.876,You gonna take it or not?
00:32:21.774,00:32:24.150,This is the Number 3 L.
00:32:24.192,00:32:26.737,It's made of high carbon steel.
00:32:26.779,00:32:28.822,"That's correct, Dr. Murphy."
00:32:44.379,00:32:49.342,"Loudspeaker: We have a code green -- patient is a Caucasian male, 73 years of age."
00:32:49.384,00:32:51.303,Where'd he go?
00:32:51.344,00:32:53.346,"Yeah, on my way."
00:32:55.933,00:32:59.227,I have a five-centimeter segment of proximal jejunum.
00:32:59.269,00:33:01.814,"It's...sclerotic, but not perforated."
00:33:01.855,00:33:03.732,"All right, mark it and move on."
00:33:05.400,00:33:07.152,We have 25 feet of bowel to run.
00:33:08.612,00:33:11.740,"Shaun, you need to get moving -- unless you've found something."
00:33:11.782,00:33:15.285,I have -- the perforation.
00:33:13.659,00:33:18.747,Clamp it off -- I'll get in there with the enterotomy scissors and remove the damaged segment.
00:33:18.789,00:33:21.040,I can't.
00:33:22.417,00:33:24.419,You can't? Why not?
00:33:24.461,00:33:26.630,It's a phlegmon.
00:33:26.672,00:33:28.298,You found a walled-off abscess?
00:33:28.340,00:33:29.215,It's large.
00:33:29.257,00:33:30.926,-Don't touch it.
00:33:30.968,00:33:35.388,"If you move and that thing ruptures, the pus will spread to his entire abdominal cavity -- this boy dies."
00:33:35.430,00:33:37.307,"I know, that's why I'm not moving."
00:33:37.349,00:33:39.100,"Claire, I need you to open it up gently."
00:33:39.142,00:33:43.814,"I'm gonna evacuate the septic contents, flush the cavity with antibiotics, and then I'm gonna have you remove the capsule."
00:33:45.064,00:33:46.274,I didn't do anything.
00:33:46.316,00:33:47.567,That's the pressure tanking.
00:33:47.609,00:33:49.653,You need to finish what you're doing right now.
00:33:52.823,00:33:55.116,"Let's go, Claire."
00:33:57.995,00:33:59.329,Clamp.
00:33:59.371,00:34:02.165,"Uh, you guys check left."
00:34:09.381,00:34:12.133,Hey. Hey. Come on.
00:34:12.175,00:34:14.594,Stop.
00:34:14.636,00:34:17.055,"Come on, Glen."
00:34:17.096,00:34:18.264,We can do this.
00:34:18.306,00:34:21.935,I don't want to -- I just don't want to.
00:34:21.977,00:34:24.354,Please leave me alone.
00:34:24.396,00:34:29.150,"Once I get my strength back, I'll climb up and jump."
00:34:31.028,00:34:33.446,I can't let you do that.
00:34:43.707,00:34:51.673,"When this temporary pacer fails, which it will, your heart may stop and you die suddenly."
00:34:51.715,00:35:00.557,"But more likely, Glen, you slip back into that slow rhythm, your chest is racked with excruciating pain and your lungs start to fill with fluid, and slowly you suffocate."
00:35:03.018,00:35:05.771,Just get me a DNR and a cab.
00:35:05.812,00:35:08.023,You can't help me.
00:35:17.156,00:35:19.826,"Yes, I can."
00:35:31.129,00:35:33.924,It was a difficult procedure.
00:35:33.966,00:35:37.135,We removed a total of two feet of -- Is he okay?
00:35:37.176,00:35:38.637,He will be okay.
00:35:40.764,00:35:42.140,Thank you.
00:35:43.642,00:35:47.604,"Thank you, thank you."
00:35:50.315,00:35:53.986,I-I'm sorry.
00:35:56.696,00:35:58.406,He's our son.
00:35:58.448,00:36:00.408,You shouldn't feel bad.
00:36:00.450,00:36:02.995,You did what you thought was best for Liam.
00:36:03.036,00:36:05.371,You love Liam.
00:36:05.413,00:36:09.668,I didn't have that from my parents.
00:36:09.709,00:36:15.507,"It also means I didn't have to take kava root, so I didn't get hypereosinophilic gastroenteritis."
00:36:31.023,00:36:34.442,Are you gonna get in trouble for this?
00:36:35.610,00:36:38.905,You're worried about me now?
00:36:38.947,00:36:41.491,You signed the DNR.
00:36:41.533,00:36:43.827,All I'm doing is sitting with you.
00:37:09.644,00:37:11.521,Are you feeling any anxiety?
00:37:11.563,00:37:13.940,No.
00:37:13.982,00:37:15.608,Pain?
00:37:15.650,00:37:17.736,Some.
00:37:17.777,00:37:21.573,Would you like a dose of morphine to help with that?
00:37:49.768,00:37:52.896,Thank you.
00:38:22.259,00:38:23.718,Find your guy?
00:38:23.760,00:38:27.388,I did.
00:38:27.430,00:38:29.515,Put in the biventricular?
00:38:32.936,00:38:35.396,How long did it take to get access to the coronary sinus?
00:38:38.024,00:38:41.945,I didn't do the surgery.
00:38:41.987,00:38:44.906,I didn't put the pacer in.
00:38:44.948,00:38:47.033,he didn't want it.
00:38:53.999,00:38:56.375,He was a good guy.
00:39:05.051,00:39:08.930,"I lost a patient, too."
00:39:12.350,00:39:13.601,Want to talk about it?
00:39:19.649,00:39:21.026,I do.
00:39:50.847,00:39:53.558,Your surgery went well.
00:39:53.599,00:39:58.855,You should be able to get up and move around in two weeks once we're sure the antibiotics have cleared your infection.
00:39:58.897,00:40:00.439,Hear that?
00:40:00.481,00:40:02.901,It won't be too long until we can go home.
00:40:02.942,00:40:05.528,"You did great, honey."
00:40:08.823,00:40:12.160,The lights.
00:40:16.539,00:40:17.790,Are the lights okay?
00:40:19.959,00:40:21.294,Do you want them dimmed?
00:40:25.382,00:40:28.927,They're...okay.
00:40:47.528,00:40:49.614,You'll love the software.
00:40:49.655,00:40:51.908,It makes it very easy to budget.
00:40:51.950,00:40:56.454,"And the best part, it links directly to the bank, and -- get rid of the ball!"
00:40:56.495,00:41:03.420,"He was the first quarterback picked in 2013, but his stats outside the pocket are only 27% competed passes."
00:41:03.461,00:41:07.048,Their backup QB is at 65% under pressure.
00:41:07.090,00:41:08.716,Absolutely.
00:41:08.758,00:41:11.344,He's wasted potential on the bench.
00:41:11.386,00:41:16.349,"Anyway, the link to the bank will help make automatic -- Oh!"
00:41:16.391,00:41:17.683,Did you see that?
00:41:17.725,00:41:20.312,He pinned it against his helmet -- even with the PI!
00:41:20.353,00:41:21.896,I want to go to the Super Bowl.
00:41:21.938,00:41:25.858,"Okay, see, that's exactly the kind of thing you have to think about before you buy."
00:41:25.900,00:41:27.860,Tickets are very expensive.
00:41:27.902,00:41:30.780,"Oh, hoo-hoo-hoo!"
00:41:32.782,00:41:34.659,You know -- You know what?
00:41:34.700,00:41:36.035,I should go. We should go.
00:41:36.077,00:41:36.995,Okay.
00:41:37.036,00:41:38.621,Excuse me.
00:41:38.663,00:41:41.082,"Uh, it's almost closing time, so..."
00:41:41.124,00:41:43.876,I'd like to buy this TV.
00:41:46.921,00:41:48.840,...stay as long as you like.
00:01:56.950,00:01:59.035,You won't believe the crap Armen pulled last night.
00:01:59.661,00:02:01.663,He cut the power to my apartment. That's right.
00:02:02.038,00:02:04.666,"No lights, no Wi-Fi, nothing."
00:02:04.874,00:02:06.501,For 15 minutes.
00:02:08.545,00:02:12.006,"And if I'd have been on a ventilator, I could've suffocated in that time."
00:02:12.132,00:02:13.216,Right? You're a doctor.
00:02:13.967,00:02:15.343,You're not on a ventilator.
00:02:15.468,00:02:17.679,Thank God for that. But I could be.
00:02:17.887,00:02:19.889,"I mean, it was dark. I could've tripped."
00:02:20.056,00:02:21.141,I should sue him.
00:02:24.519,00:02:27.021,"Sorry, were you gonna eat this? I stress eat."
00:02:27.355,00:02:32.235,"Okay, listen, I go to talk to him and he claims that I was playing my music too loud again."
00:02:33.653,00:02:36.865,I wear earplugs when your music irritates me.
00:02:37.407,00:02:38.825,I miss the dripping.
00:02:39.534,00:02:40.827,"You're missing the point here, Shaun."
00:02:40.910,00:02:44.164,"Okay, you knock, you ask. You don't cut someone's power."
00:02:44.664,00:02:45.707,"You'd knock, right?"
00:02:46.583,00:02:48.793,Of course you would knock. Any normal person would.
00:02:48.918,00:02:51.462,"I mean, am I crazy, or is he a total sociopath?"
00:02:51.629,00:02:52.922,You should get headphones.
00:02:53.923,00:02:54.966,Headphones?
00:02:55.341,00:02:59.929,"They would eliminate the sound-- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. Thank you."
00:03:00.638,00:03:02.599,Thank you for being so objective about this.
00:03:02.682,00:03:05.768,"In fact, why don't you go help Armen write my eviction notice?"
00:03:26.748,00:03:27.999,It was a pretty bad memory.
00:03:33.838,00:03:35.548,"It's kind of hot for a hike, isn't it?"
00:03:39.636,00:03:41.763,"Put everything in a bag. Come on, right now."
00:03:41.846,00:03:44.057,"Hey. Don't move. Give me your wallets, phones, everything."
00:03:44.140,00:03:45.391,Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
00:03:46.267,00:03:47.518,I said get out your wallet!
00:03:48.811,00:03:49.854,Do it now!
00:03:51.105,00:03:52.440,"Wallet, now!"
00:03:54.442,00:03:55.318,Is he okay?
00:03:55.401,00:03:57.028,We don't know. This was routed through Basecamp.
00:03:57.320,00:03:59.530,"They said Shaun was there, but they didn't say if he was hurt or not."
00:03:59.614,00:04:01.115,"Well, EMS has two critical inbounding."
00:04:01.199,00:04:02.951,Their hands are a little full to chat right now.
00:04:04.410,00:04:07.247,"Twenty-year-old female, single gunshot wound to the abdomen."
00:04:07.330,00:04:09.999,Hypotensive and tachy. Two liters of saline en route.
00:04:10.124,00:04:11.209,Her name's Avery.
00:04:11.292,00:04:13.962,"We'll take good care of her. Jared, you're with me."
00:04:22.387,00:04:25.598,Blunt-force neck injury. Oxygen sats just dropped below 80.
00:04:25.682,00:04:26.766,Trachea's crushed.
00:04:26.849,00:04:29.435,"I inserted a laryngeal mask, but the airway is not secured."
00:04:29.519,00:04:31.229,Are you okay? You weren't hurt?
00:04:31.312,00:04:33.731,His oropharyngeal anatomy is distorted from the contusion.
00:04:33.856,00:04:35.566,Subcutaneous emphysema. He's barely moving air.
00:04:35.650,00:04:37.819,Let's take him to a bay. And get me an OR. Now.
00:04:37.902,00:04:39.487,I need four units O-negative. Type and cross her.
00:04:39.612,00:04:41.489,She has decreased breath sounds on the left.
00:04:41.781,00:04:43.199,Let's get a chest X-ray on her.
00:04:45.994,00:04:47.662,What the hell is he doing here?
00:04:51.165,00:04:52.166,It's his fault.
00:04:55.169,00:04:56.462,This is all his fault.
00:05:15.064,00:05:19.527,"Yeah. Clerk says the guy entered, shouted orders, and apparently, your doctor didn't comply."
00:05:20.028,00:05:22.613,Girl gets shot and the store clerk clocks the gunman with a bat. That's all we know.
00:05:22.697,00:05:23.740,All right. What do you need?
00:05:23.823,00:05:25.575,I need forensics on the gunman and the girl.
00:05:25.658,00:05:27.327,"All right, we'll let you know what we find out."
00:05:28.786,00:05:31.289,"Hey, the police are gonna wanna talk to you. After that, you can go home."
00:05:31.497,00:05:34.584,I should be helping. My shift is just starting.
00:05:34.751,00:05:36.627,You were at the shooting. I don't have time to hold your hand.
00:05:36.711,00:05:38.379,I don't like my hand being held.
00:05:40.506,00:05:41.716,They ricochet inside.
00:05:41.799,00:05:44.218,They can cause multiple and unpredictable injuries.
00:05:46.012,00:05:47.305,And what do we need to do about it?
00:05:47.388,00:05:51.309,"Chest and abdominal X-rays, and a focused assessment sonogram."
00:05:51.601,00:05:53.186,"Could use your help over here, Dr. Melendez."
00:05:54.437,00:05:55.563,Are you okay?
00:05:55.646,00:05:56.898,"Yes, I'm fine."
00:05:57.190,00:05:59.484,-You're with me. Get a gown on him. -Okay.
00:06:00.985,00:06:02.528,The bullet fractured the pelvis on the way in.
00:06:02.612,00:06:04.739,"All right, let's look for an exit wound. We're gonna roll her on three."
00:06:04.822,00:06:06.324,"One, two, three."
00:06:08.993,00:06:10.036,"She's hemorrhaging here, too."
00:06:10.119,00:06:12.413,"Murphy, get us the ultrasound so we can find out what's inside."
00:06:29.388,00:06:31.724,No chest contusions or secondary injuries evident.
00:06:31.808,00:06:32.975,Oxygen sats 70.
00:06:33.059,00:06:34.727,I can't squeeze the camera past this collapse.
00:06:34.936,00:06:36.562,"OR Three's prepped and ready, but that's it."
00:06:36.646,00:06:38.272,We've got a full house right now up in surgery.
00:06:38.356,00:06:40.691,-Next show time's 15 minutes out. -I could use it.
00:06:42.193,00:06:43.820,What's the status on your guy?
00:06:43.903,00:06:45.238,Take her up. Take the gunshot.
00:06:45.321,00:06:48.157,"Hold on. This airway's so damaged, I can't even do a tracheotomy."
00:06:48.241,00:06:50.284,He's got five minutes until anoxic brain death.
00:07:15.560,00:07:20.148,"Now that our patient is actually breathing, we can realign and repair. Four-O on a driver."
00:07:28.072,00:07:29.740,influence your medical judgment.
00:07:30.491,00:07:31.534,I didn't.
00:07:31.701,00:07:35.746,"I get the instinct. She's a victim, he's a shooter. A racist."
00:07:36.038,00:07:37.748,"Often, we don't even know we're doing it."
00:07:37.832,00:07:40.251,I would never let my personal feelings impact a patient's care.
00:07:40.501,00:07:41.544,She was bleeding out.
00:07:41.627,00:07:43.713,And this guy just drew his first good breath 30 seconds ago.
00:07:43.796,00:07:44.964,They were both critical.
00:07:45.047,00:07:46.966,He was dying. You were wrong. Own it.
00:07:47.675,00:07:50.219,You know as well as I do that that was not an easy call to make.
00:07:50.386,00:07:51.596,-Do I? -Yes.
00:08:00.438,00:08:03.357,"Not my operative field, the surgical field. Scrub out."
00:08:05.776,00:08:07.987,You're done. Step out of my OR.
00:08:08.863,00:08:12.783,"Gail, can you please relieve Dr. Browne of her instruments and page Dr. Cleland to assist me?"
00:08:29.467,00:08:31.093,"Aside from the spleen, what else are we dealing with?"
00:08:37.975,00:08:39.894,Why does her boyfriend think it's your fault?
00:08:41.354,00:08:45.399,It punctured her diaphragm here and entered the posterior chest.
00:08:56.369,00:08:57.912,Hold this right there. Don't let go.
00:08:59.455,00:09:00.498,"No, this isn't gonna work."
00:09:00.581,00:09:02.250,It's gonna be like sewing ground beef back into a steak.
00:09:02.333,00:09:04.377,"All right, new plan. She's gonna have to live without her spleen."
00:09:04.460,00:09:05.545,Metzen and pick-up.
00:09:07.255,00:09:10.383,I need a ligating suture around the splenic artery while I make the cut.
00:09:10.466,00:09:13.427,"Can you do that for me before this young lady bleeds out on us, Murphy?"
00:10:19.327,00:10:22.163,Shaun. Thank God you're all right.
00:10:22.747,00:10:24.332,I just heard what happened.
00:10:26.334,00:10:29.420,Shaun? Are you all right?
00:10:31.464,00:10:33.341,Yes. I wasn't injured.
00:10:33.716,00:10:35.217,What happened this morning?
00:10:35.509,00:10:37.136,Lea ate my apple.
00:10:37.219,00:10:39.096,"No, Shaun, at the store this morning."
00:10:39.180,00:10:41.265,What happened at the store?
00:10:44.143,00:10:45.227,"Wallet, now!"
00:10:45.311,00:10:47.021,-I can't. -Why the hell not?
00:10:48.898,00:10:51.233,You said keep my hands where you could see them.
00:10:52.109,00:10:56.405,My wallet is in my pocket. You can't see my hands if-- Are you trying to be a hero?
00:10:56.489,00:10:58.157,I'm a surgical resident.
00:10:58.240,00:10:59.283,Hey. Hey. Shut the hell up.
00:10:59.367,00:11:01.952,"-Okay. Okay. Okay. -This isn't a game, man. I'm serious."
00:11:02.036,00:11:04.121,Put your damn phone and wallet on the ground. Right now!
00:11:04.205,00:11:06.707,"Hey, do you see this, man? I am not playing around."
00:11:06.791,00:11:09.085,Just put your phone and wallet on the damn ground.
00:11:09.210,00:11:10.252,"Come on, man. Just do what he says."
00:11:10.336,00:11:11.379,Please listen to him.
00:11:11.462,00:11:13.381,Shut up! Just shut up and get on your knees.
00:11:13.464,00:11:15.007,Put your hands and knees on the ground.
00:11:17.093,00:11:20.971,"I will shoot your crazy ass, -Are you listening to me? I'll do it! -Yes."
00:11:46.705,00:11:48.833,"Okay, you need to take the rest of the day off."
00:11:48.916,00:11:51.585,"Dr. Melendez said that, too. Why?"
00:11:51.669,00:11:56.465,Why? Because you just experienced a traumatic event-- -It's not my fault. -I know that.
00:11:58.175,00:12:01.595,Avery has multiple injuries. Dr. Melendez wants me to monitor her.
00:12:09.645,00:12:10.688,Dr. Lim.
00:12:13.149,00:12:16.485,I was out of line. I shouldn't have argued with you… Primary closure went well.
00:12:16.694,00:12:20.448,We'll extubate him in a few hours to prevent any further internal damage.
00:12:20.698,00:12:21.740,"Oh, that's good."
00:12:21.824,00:12:23.951,It is. And you're gonna make sure he stays that way.
00:12:24.034,00:12:25.870,You'll be baby-sitting him tonight in the ICU.
00:12:27.955,00:12:29.582,I'm… I'm not on call.
00:12:29.665,00:12:30.875,"Great, then you're available."
00:12:31.083,00:12:32.126,It should be a quiet night.
00:12:32.209,00:12:33.711,Just want to keep an eye on those vitals.
00:12:34.003,00:12:35.379,You never know with trachea tears.
00:12:36.130,00:12:38.007,Can't one of the ICU nurses do that?
00:12:38.090,00:12:41.177,"Yep, but they didn't lip off in my operating room."
00:12:41.385,00:12:43.179,And he'd better be breathing in the morning.
00:12:49.351,00:12:52.771,"Excuse me, but why is Shaun on the victim's case?"
00:12:52.938,00:12:55.065,I assessed him and he seemed perfectly capable.
00:12:55.149,00:12:56.692,You assessed him? What does that mean?
00:12:56.775,00:12:59.278,You asked him how he was feeling? Are you psychic?
00:12:59.737,00:13:01.989,Do you have an advanced degree in psychology?
00:13:02.072,00:13:04.200,You don't know what's going on in his head.
00:13:06.619,00:13:12.416,"When I'm in surgery, my focus is on the person whose guts are open in front of me rather than the soul of the person standing across from me."
00:13:13.125,00:13:15.878,And it seems that Shaun doesn't let anything impact his work.
00:13:16.128,00:13:19.673,"So along with his photographic memory, I'm putting cold-hearted in the plus column."
00:13:30.100,00:13:33.270,Yes. Dr. Glassman said I had to talk to you.
00:13:33.979,00:13:39.985,After any doctor goes through a potentially traumatic-- You have to determine if I am a medico-legal liability to the hospital.
00:13:40.069,00:13:46.033,"Yes. And, more importantly, it's an opportunity to provide you with emotional support."
00:13:51.163,00:13:52.289,How are you feeling?
00:13:54.416,00:13:55.751,You don't have apples.
00:13:58.671,00:14:00.214,I'll try to have some fruit next time we meet.
00:14:01.048,00:14:02.383,Good.
00:14:04.093,00:14:06.804,Do you regret anything about this morning?
00:14:09.139,00:14:10.266,Why?
00:14:10.641,00:14:15.521,"After bad things happen, it's perfectly normal to replay the events, wishing you'd done things differently."
00:14:15.604,00:14:18.774,It already happened. I can't do things differently.
00:14:21.694,00:14:23.529,Is talking about this upsetting you?
00:14:28.492,00:14:30.286,What are you thinking about right now?
00:14:32.580,00:14:35.916,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
00:14:45.676,00:14:48.053,"Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart."
00:14:48.387,00:14:50.347,"Any, or all of them, can start to shut down."
00:14:50.806,00:14:55.686,"We'll be giving her anti-inflammatories and monitoring her closely, but the next 24 hours are critical."
00:14:55.769,00:14:57.938,Okay. Thanks. Just get her through this.
00:14:58.022,00:14:59.064,Whatever you gotta do.
00:14:59.189,00:15:02.234,"Yeah, well, I need consent forms from your girlfriend's next of kin."
00:15:02.985,00:15:05.863,If you could please get her family in here as quickly as possible.
00:15:09.783,00:15:10.826,I can't.
00:15:15.664,00:15:17.458,I don't even know her last name.
00:15:17.833,00:15:20.461,"It was our first date, we met on a dating app."
00:15:20.544,00:15:23.631,"We were going hiking, so she wasn't carrying a purse or ID."
00:15:24.590,00:15:27.134,"Well, then you really don't need to be here."
00:15:30.638,00:15:31.972,Someone out there cares about her.
00:15:32.056,00:15:35.059,"If she dies, I want them to know someone was with her."
00:15:38.312,00:15:40.898,I'll have social work try to locate her family.
00:15:43.150,00:15:44.526,Stay as long as you want.
00:15:55.454,00:15:58.415,"It looks clean, dry, and healthy."
00:15:58.582,00:15:59.875,My neck is killing me.
00:16:02.836,00:16:04.338,How long have you been using?
00:16:06.340,00:16:08.676,"Well, you've likely built up a tolerance to pain meds."
00:16:08.884,00:16:11.053,"And now that you really need them, they aren't there for you."
00:16:11.136,00:16:14.556,"That's why I need fentanyl, 100 micrograms. Are you gonna help me or not?"
00:16:14.640,00:16:15.724,I wouldn't be helping.
00:16:15.808,00:16:17.601,The worst thing I could do for you is feed your habit.
00:16:20.980,00:16:22.147,What?
00:16:22.231,00:16:23.482,You saw my tattoo.
00:16:24.733,00:16:25.609,Yeah.
00:16:25.943,00:16:27.319,And now you're punishing me.
00:16:27.569,00:16:31.490,"-You want this to hurt. -I am treating you professionally-- If you were treating me professionally, I wouldn't be in so much pain."
00:16:31.573,00:16:33.659,"-I'm sorry, but I won't-- -Just give me the damn drugs!"
00:16:34.118,00:16:35.160,Come on!
00:16:51.593,00:16:56.140,Melendez thinks that he's okay being on Avery's case. I don't.
00:16:57.099,00:16:58.600,Dr. Melendez may be right.
00:16:58.684,00:17:00.978,That case seems to be Shaun's primary focus right now.
00:17:01.061,00:17:03.689,Maybe his condition is a blessing in this situation.
00:17:03.772,00:17:04.815,Maybe?
00:17:04.898,00:17:08.193,Or obsessing over Avery's health could be his only outlet for a guilty conscience.
00:17:08.527,00:17:10.988,Watching her suffer could just be worsening those feelings.
00:17:11.071,00:17:13.490,"So either it's a huge problem, or it's not a problem at all."
00:17:13.574,00:17:16.160,This is your professional opinion?
00:17:16.326,00:17:19.788,Shaun has a very unique mind and an incredibly introverted nature.
00:17:23.375,00:17:24.668,"Well, thank you for that."
00:17:26.128,00:17:30.340,"I'm sorry, but without a lot more time with him, that's the best I can offer."
00:17:38.807,00:17:40.184,What did Lim expect me to do?
00:17:40.267,00:17:43.479,Stand there and smile while she called my medical judgment into question?
00:17:43.604,00:17:46.023,"Your patient nearly died waiting on that OR, right?"
00:17:46.106,00:17:47.733,It was bad. What do you want me to do?
00:17:47.816,00:17:49.318,-Tell her to back off. -No.
00:17:49.651,00:17:52.071,-He's a complete and utter-- -Not one of those nice racists?
00:17:52.154,00:17:55.616,-I shouldn't have to be-- -Claire… here's what you have to do.
00:17:55.741,00:17:57.951,Shut up and do exactly what Dr. Lim tells you to do.
00:17:58.035,00:18:02.331,"But, it-- Yes, sir."
00:18:12.758,00:18:14.218,Maybe we could take turns.
00:18:15.260,00:18:17.971,"You keep an eye on my patient, I keep an eye on yours."
00:18:21.391,00:18:23.852,Her creatinine is 1.6.
00:18:25.395,00:18:29.233,A mild bump in renal numbers isn't surprising after all her trauma.
00:18:34.488,00:18:36.031,This morning must have been crazy.
00:18:37.074,00:18:38.117,Are you okay?
00:18:40.452,00:18:43.622,"This morning, my neighbor Lea came over and ate my apple."
00:18:44.915,00:18:46.166,That's too bad.
00:18:46.416,00:18:48.043,"Yes, it was my last one."
00:18:48.544,00:18:50.754,"She was upset with Armen, our landlord."
00:18:51.255,00:18:54.716,She plays her music very loud. I gave her some advice.
00:18:54.800,00:18:57.636,It seemed to anger her because she left without saying goodbye.
00:18:59.054,00:19:01.014,And you think you did something wrong?
00:19:02.266,00:19:03.934,"No, it was good advice."
00:19:06.270,00:19:10.149,"Shaun, sometimes a woman wants advice, and sometimes she just wants support."
00:19:12.568,00:19:14.528,How can I tell which one Lea wants?
00:19:16.738,00:19:17.948,Err on the side of support.
00:19:18.031,00:19:19.992,"-That's not helpful. -Yes, it is."
00:19:20.075,00:19:22.035,"Dr. Browne, you're being summoned."
00:19:25.873,00:19:26.999,All right.
00:19:30.669,00:19:31.837,About time.
00:19:35.007,00:19:37.092,"All your struggling, you've pulled out your IV."
00:19:39.386,00:19:41.847,Aren't nurses usually supposed to do this kind of crap?
00:19:45.100,00:19:48.395,"They let you go to med school, but they don't trust you with any real responsibility."
00:19:49.771,00:19:54.151,There must be a competent doctor tucked around here somewhere who can tell someone I need more than aspirin.
00:19:54.860,00:19:57.571,-Competent? -Yeah. You know what I mean.
00:20:00.490,00:20:03.911,Imhotep was the father of modern medicine. An Egyptian.
00:20:03.994,00:20:05.829,Yeah? Good for your people.
00:20:07.956,00:20:11.418,"I'm willing to bet there's even been a couple of others over the last 3,000 years."
00:20:11.543,00:20:19.092,"But guess what? On average, you look at most great technological advancements, you'll find a proud Northern European holding the patent."
00:20:22.221,00:20:25.557,Get the patent on stealing 30 bucks from the corner store for a drug fix?
00:20:27.476,00:20:28.977,"You don't like drug addicts, do you?"
00:20:31.521,00:20:32.773,There's a lot of people I don't like.
00:20:34.066,00:20:40.239,"Thieves, racists, violent punks. But I'll treat 'em."
00:20:46.203,00:20:47.246,Wow.
00:20:48.330,00:20:50.958,"That's the beauty of cliches, is they're true so often."
00:20:51.208,00:20:53.001,You don't know anything about me.
00:20:54.795,00:20:55.963,I didn't go to college.
00:20:56.880,00:20:59.633,"I didn't have no affirmative action to get me in, but you did."
00:21:00.342,00:21:05.472,All because some bleeding-heart liberal in the dean's office teared up reading your essay about your crack-whore momma.
00:21:12.229,00:21:13.814,I guess we're all violent punks.
00:21:31.915,00:21:33.917,All you had to do was give him your wallet.
00:21:49.641,00:21:51.018,Her urine output is low.
00:21:52.352,00:21:54.813,Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing? Get away from her!
00:21:54.896,00:21:56.773,"Hey, hey! You can't be in here shoving my doctors around."
00:21:56.857,00:22:01.486,"Me? He's the… Oh, my God."
00:22:01.570,00:22:04.573,She needs dialysis. Her kidneys are failing fast.
00:22:06.033,00:22:08.744,This is the first stage of total organ failure.
00:22:19.838,00:22:21.006,but she's getting worse.
00:22:21.673,00:22:22.883,Fluid's building up in her chest.
00:22:23.133,00:22:24.634,"She's in pulmonary failure, too."
00:22:24.718,00:22:28.096,Draining the fluid in her pleural space would reduce airway resistance.
00:22:28.180,00:22:29.806,Yeah. Let's prep her for a thoracentesis.
00:22:31.016,00:22:32.225,We're gonna have to work fast.
00:22:33.101,00:22:34.311,I'll prep the evac drain.
00:22:34.394,00:22:37.481,I'm gonna need you to put that needle right between-- Sixth and seventh rib.
00:22:46.239,00:22:48.033,-Wait. You're gonna let him do it? -Shut up.
00:22:48.450,00:22:50.285,"Right, careful. Don't put the needle in too deep."
00:22:50.368,00:22:52.162,-We don't wanna give her-- -Pneumothorax.
00:22:54.122,00:22:55.332,"Right, you're in."
00:22:58.752,00:23:04.049,"Now let me see what I can pull out… And, hopefully, she settles down."
00:23:19.981,00:23:21.691,CO2's down and O2's climbing.
00:23:24.319,00:23:28.698,"We can manage her kidneys and her lungs, but the last stop in multiple organ failure would be her heart."
00:23:28.990,00:23:30.992,Watch her ventilation pressures like a hawk.
00:23:31.451,00:23:34.746,"Push cardio-protective meds, and page me if anything changes."
00:23:37.541,00:23:38.625,Think you're being her hero?
00:23:39.793,00:23:42.754,"Fact is, you hardly know her. And you don't know him at all."
00:23:44.131,00:23:45.465,Go home.
00:24:00.605,00:24:04.401,"Okay, I am done. He is a foul-mouthed, spiteful bully."
00:24:04.818,00:24:08.321,No problem. I'll have the concierge find a patient more suited to your liking.
00:24:12.993,00:24:13.994,I don't care.
00:24:14.661,00:24:17.914,"Look… I am sorry I disagreed with you, okay?"
00:24:17.998,00:24:24.087,But I don't deserve to be scolded like a schoolgirl because your ego can't handle being challenged a little.
00:24:25.422,00:24:26.923,That is some apology.
00:24:27.465,00:24:29.801,"Look, I had a legitimate-- You really don't see the problem here?"
00:24:29.885,00:24:31.887,What? With challenging you?
00:24:33.096,00:24:37.601,"Right now, you are confronting me in front of two nurses."
00:24:38.351,00:24:39.895,Would you do that to Melendez?
00:24:40.270,00:24:42.272,Or would you wait five minutes?
00:24:45.400,00:24:48.820,I have dealt with men undermining my authority my entire career.
00:24:49.362,00:24:50.989,"We shouldn't do it to one another, too."
00:24:51.615,00:24:54.201,"Now go take care of him, like you would any other patient."
00:25:04.336,00:25:06.421,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:25:06.504,00:25:09.007,"Food services, they double-check every order."
00:25:09.090,00:25:10.842,-What are you looking for? -An apple.
00:25:11.051,00:25:12.552,-An apple? Who's getting an apple? -I am.
00:25:14.012,00:25:15.096,"forget the apple, please."
00:25:15.430,00:25:16.848,"I'm sorry, can I have a minute?"
00:25:18.099,00:25:19.142,Shaun?
00:25:20.435,00:25:21.478,Okay.
00:25:26.441,00:25:28.902,"Shaun, there's no need to get defensive, okay?"
00:25:28.985,00:25:30.779,"-Do you wanna sit down? -No, thank you."
00:25:32.781,00:25:36.284,I want you to tell me again exactly what happened this morning.
00:25:36.368,00:25:38.495,I told you exactly what happened this morning.
00:25:38.578,00:25:42.332,"Yes, but people have told you that it's your fault, haven't they?"
00:25:42.582,00:25:45.752,My actions and the shooting were associative incidents.
00:25:46.044,00:25:47.837,It is not a causal relationship.
00:25:48.004,00:25:50.715,"I paced and she got shot, but pacing doesn't cause shootings."
00:25:50.799,00:25:53.385,"Otherwise, every time someone paced a shooting would soon follow."
00:25:53.927,00:25:55.553,"Okay, that's a very good point."
00:25:58.223,00:26:03.895,"When someone has a gun and it's a dangerous situation, right?"
00:26:04.521,00:26:07.983,"You don't wanna upset the situation, you don't wanna make it worse."
00:26:08.775,00:26:11.152,"You think this is my fault, too?"
00:26:16.574,00:26:19.577,but your actions may have contributed to it.
00:26:20.120,00:26:22.205,"Okay, Shaun, wait a second. Wait a second."
00:26:22.289,00:26:29.045,"I know your behavior is not completely in your control, but I also know it's not completely out of your control. Is it?"
00:26:30.547,00:26:32.966,"So, yes, maybe it is a little bit your fault."
00:26:34.801,00:26:37.178,And definitely… mine.
00:26:38.430,00:26:39.681,You weren't even there.
00:26:41.766,00:26:44.144,"That's right, I wasn't there."
00:26:47.814,00:26:49.691,"Can we sit down, please? Just for a second."
00:26:57.365,00:27:03.330,"Shaun, I convinced myself that everything was fine, because in here it is."
00:27:03.413,00:27:04.456,It's great.
00:27:05.540,00:27:06.583,But you need help.
00:27:07.959,00:27:09.044,Shaun?
00:27:10.295,00:27:11.504,You need guidance.
00:27:12.964,00:27:14.924,Much more than I can give you.
00:27:20.472,00:27:22.182,I'm supposed to be with my patient.
00:27:22.265,00:27:24.392,I'm supposed to be watching her like a hawk.
00:27:46.664,00:27:47.957,It's my fault.
00:27:52.587,00:27:53.838,I didn't like her.
00:27:54.214,00:28:12.982,"When I first saw her this morning, she just… didn't look… I don't know, I… I mean, I wanted to blow her off, so I said I forgot water."
00:28:13.942,00:28:17.153,"And I figured we'd go to the store, and then I'd pretend that I forgot my wallet."
00:28:17.237,00:28:22.075,"I knew she didn't have her purse, so… You can't go hiking without water, right?"
00:28:29.249,00:28:30.792,She was there because of me.
00:28:34.045,00:28:36.464,She's here because of me.
00:28:38.967,00:28:40.969,It's not a causal relationship.
00:28:43.138,00:28:44.472,"Wait, excuse me?"
00:28:48.143,00:28:50.895,It's not a causal relationship. Lying and shootings.
00:28:50.979,00:28:56.943,"Lying doesn't cause shootings, otherwise, every time someone lied-- Her pulse pressure is narrow."
00:28:57.068,00:28:58.027,"Wait, what does that mean?"
00:28:58.820,00:28:59.863,She's dying.
00:29:00.405,00:29:01.614,Page Melendez. Stat.
00:29:09.789,00:29:11.124,Your respiratory rate is up.
00:29:11.499,00:29:12.792,Are you having trouble breathing?
00:29:22.552,00:29:23.970,Find Dr. Lim.
00:29:25.930,00:29:28.767,Narrow pulse pressure indicates a reduced cardiac output.
00:29:28.850,00:29:30.477,The inflammation is affecting her heart.
00:29:30.560,00:29:32.187,She's in end-stage organ failure.
00:29:32.270,00:29:34.147,"Yes, we can insert an intra-aortic balloon pump."
00:29:37.859,00:29:39.694,It only needs to work overnight.
00:29:39.778,00:29:41.654,The inflammatory reaction will improve after that.
00:29:41.738,00:29:43.490,What if it's failing so fast because it's not her heart?
00:29:45.325,00:29:48.161,Her hemoglobin's dropped from 14 to 12 between her last two draws.
00:29:48.244,00:29:49.996,What if the real problem is she's bleeding somewhere?
00:29:50.079,00:29:52.749,"Given what she's been through, a two-point drop could mean nothing."
00:29:52.832,00:29:55.668,"Or it could mean a bleed, which would account for the narrow pulse pressure."
00:29:55.752,00:29:56.961,Her heart could be fine.
00:29:58.254,00:30:00.507,"If you're right, that means we'd have to open her back up."
00:30:00.590,00:30:02.383,I don't know if her body could handle another operation.
00:30:02.467,00:30:03.510,"No, it can't."
00:30:03.593,00:30:07.013,Treating heart failure with an aortic pump is also a simple procedure.
00:30:07.722,00:30:10.391,So we're going to diagnose based on which procedure is simpler?
00:30:10.600,00:30:13.436,"If I'm right, there could be no more blood to pump. She'll be dead."
00:30:17.106,00:30:18.149,She's crashing.
00:30:18.441,00:30:20.109,We should prepare the cath lab for a pump.
00:30:20.193,00:30:21.528,We should prepare the OR.
00:30:25.907,00:30:27.200,Let's get her into an OR. Now.
00:30:38.753,00:30:40.463,Hemoglobin's dropped to eight.
00:30:44.217,00:30:47.303,Gotta find where the bleeder's coming from and clip it before she dies.
00:30:48.763,00:30:49.848,I got nothing.
00:30:49.931,00:30:52.183,It must be hidden underneath the retro peritoneum or mediastinum.
00:30:52.267,00:30:54.769,That's a lot of real estate to cut open and just go blindly looking.
00:30:57.146,00:30:58.565,The bullet passed through the posterior thorax.
00:30:58.648,00:31:00.692,"BP's 40 over palp. She's dying, Neil."
00:31:00.775,00:31:02.402,"Whatever you're gonna do, you need to do it now."
00:31:07.782,00:31:09.409,Prep the sternum and abdomen with betadine.
00:31:11.327,00:31:13.204,We're gonna need a sponge stick to control the bleeding when we find it.
00:31:23.715,00:31:24.757,Stop!
00:31:27.176,00:31:30.930,Open her between the second and third rib on the left side.
00:31:31.973,00:31:34.183,The bullet nicked the left supreme intercostal artery.
00:31:34.267,00:31:35.143,The wall has blown.
00:31:36.561,00:31:38.229,I followed the injuries.
00:31:38.730,00:31:40.690,Pelvis to bowel to spleen to diaphragm.
00:31:40.773,00:31:44.193,Next target has to be left supreme intercostal artery.
00:31:57.373,00:31:59.167,Dr. Lim will be along in just two minutes.
00:31:59.250,00:32:00.710,You're a damn doctor. Do your job.
00:32:02.670,00:32:03.713,I can't breathe.
00:32:12.388,00:32:16.851,"I need to open up the left neck compartment, relieve the pressure. Procedure tray."
00:32:22.357,00:32:23.733,Have you done this before?
00:32:25.860,00:32:27.612,Nope. Scalpel.
00:32:35.662,00:32:38.456,"It's too swollen, I can't see the Adam's apple."
00:32:38.539,00:32:44.420,"Okay, cut along the soft divot between the carotid sheath and the trachea."
00:32:44.504,00:32:46.631,Soft divot. Got it.
00:33:01.688,00:33:02.772,Update me.
00:33:04.649,00:33:05.692,What did you do?
00:33:05.775,00:33:07.694,"He had a cervical hematoma, I had to relieve the pressure."
00:33:07.777,00:33:08.736,Here?
00:33:13.950,00:33:15.118,Oxygen sats are going up.
00:33:16.536,00:33:19.163,"It's rare, but post-op swelling can happen with tracheal tears."
00:33:19.247,00:33:21.416,That's why we watch them so closely the first 24 hours.
00:33:21.958,00:33:24.043,You mind if we finish this off in the operating room?
00:33:32.010,00:33:34.721,You're too high. It's near the bifurcation.
00:33:40.977,00:33:44.480,"I got something. Blood's pooling right under the bifurcation. Clamp, now."
00:34:03.374,00:34:05.418,That means her heart is still strong enough to get her through the night.
00:34:09.464,00:34:11.591,"Yeah, and you just made up for it."
00:34:20.850,00:34:22.060,Good work.
00:34:48.544,00:34:53.007,"You know what? You were right, my mother had problems."
00:34:53.591,00:34:59.680,"So I couldn't afford to sit around expecting everything to be handed to me, or whatever else it is that's holding you back."
00:35:00.556,00:35:03.351,"And yeah, I got some breaks. But I worked my ass off."
00:35:03.768,00:35:06.854,"Two jobs, two roommates, every step of the way."
00:35:07.230,00:35:10.441,And that is what got me to the place where I could save your life.
00:35:28.918,00:35:31.129,but I do expect her condition to improve day by day.
00:35:33.005,00:35:34.173,"-Thank you, Doctor. -Thank you."
00:35:34.257,00:35:35.299,You're welcome.
00:35:49.188,00:35:52.108,Hey. Avery.
00:35:52.775,00:35:54.360,Sorry we weren't here for you.
00:35:54.610,00:35:55.695,How are you feeling?
00:35:57.530,00:35:59.490,I probably won't be hiking any time soon.
00:36:03.786,00:36:04.871,Hey.
00:36:05.955,00:36:07.957,Are you sneaking out before I can thank you?
00:36:10.001,00:36:12.253,"Please, you don't need to thank me."
00:36:14.088,00:36:15.506,"Yeah, I do."
00:36:16.716,00:36:18.217,And apologize.
00:36:19.927,00:36:21.345,I was wrong about you.
00:36:25.391,00:36:27.351,I thought you were trying to ditch me.
00:36:30.980,00:36:34.984,I was hoping you were trying to ditch me.
00:36:39.572,00:36:40.823,I'm sorry.
00:36:45.077,00:36:48.664,"When you're feeling better, I'd like a second chance at a first date."
00:37:13.731,00:37:17.193,You were right. I publicly disrespected you.
00:37:17.360,00:37:20.863,And so I thought it only right to publicly respect you.
00:37:25.326,00:37:28.037,I am grateful for the chance to learn from you.
00:37:33.417,00:37:34.752,Glad you saved a life today.
00:37:36.128,00:37:37.630,Just wish it wasn't a Nazi.
00:38:11.747,00:38:13.207,Maddie always took that lane.
00:38:13.708,00:38:18.379,She'd tuck in behind me and draft until the last 200 meters.
00:38:19.588,00:38:21.257,It's a dirty little trick.
00:38:23.009,00:38:24.760,-And it worked. -Every time.
00:38:31.309,00:38:33.102,Thirteen years ago today.
00:38:34.395,00:38:35.479,Yeah.
00:38:36.314,00:38:37.440,"I miss her, too."
00:38:42.111,00:38:43.696,I gave her space.
00:38:44.030,00:38:45.698,Right? I gave her space.
00:38:46.907,00:38:49.410,And she just drifted farther and farther away.
00:38:49.493,00:38:53.122,"Everything I did, I did wrong."
00:38:53.873,00:38:55.207,You did your best.
00:39:02.506,00:39:03.632,…at your house back then.
00:39:03.716,00:39:15.061,"And, I mean, if I hadn't… You were both… You got lucky, she didn't."
00:39:19.148,00:39:33.496,"If I… was there more, if I… stayed on her… You're there for him."
00:40:03.234,00:40:04.402,I'm sorry.
00:40:07.071,00:40:10.241,Claire told me to apologize because you didn't want me to tell the truth.
00:40:10.449,00:40:14.203,"You only wanted me to support your position, even though it's wrong."
00:40:17.873,00:40:19.333,"Well, I don't accept."
00:40:21.252,00:40:23.754,I may have overreacted this morning.
00:40:24.463,00:40:25.798,A little.
00:40:26.424,00:40:27.842,And you were honest.
00:40:28.092,00:40:32.388,"Brutally honest, but you shouldn't have to wear earplugs in your own home."
00:40:34.598,00:40:37.017,And don't start lying to me to make me feel good.
00:40:38.602,00:40:40.354,You're the only honest guy I know.
00:40:43.524,00:40:52.950,"So… Have a good night, Shaun Murphy, and I will try not to keep you up."
00:41:28.194,00:41:29.653,I made a mistake today.
00:41:32.990,00:41:34.492,And someone got hurt.
00:00:04.755,00:00:06.381,Very nice meeting you.
00:00:10.260,00:00:13.973,"So, who was that?"
00:00:14.014,00:00:15.557,A housekeeper.
00:00:15.599,00:00:17.518,Leaving your place at 7:00 in the morning?
00:00:17.559,00:00:19.060,I was interviewing her.
00:00:19.102,00:00:21.146,You're hiring a housekeeper for a studio apartment?
00:00:21.188,00:00:22.356,I'm not hiring her.
00:00:22.397,00:00:23.732,Her clothes don't match.
00:00:23.774,00:00:25.066,Right.
00:00:25.108,00:00:26.193,Mm.
00:00:29.112,00:00:30.823,"You're such an asshat, Shaun Murphy."
00:00:39.122,00:00:45.671,Today we realize a dream -- seeing our international humanitarian program come to fruition.
00:00:45.713,00:00:57.599,"Our cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Neil Melendez, in consultation with our head cardiologist, Dr. Avi Mehta, evaluated children from Tanzania to Malawi to Guinea."
00:00:57.641,00:01:02.062,"They screened over 100 candidates, each of them needing life-saving surgeries."
00:01:02.103,00:01:10.779,"Ultimately, we decided on a particularly inspiring young boy named Gabriel, who hails from the Democratic Republic of Congo, with severe congenital heart anomalies."
00:01:13.448,00:01:16.869,We identified three perfect candidates -- children I can actually help.
00:01:16.911,00:01:18.913,-Gabriel wasn't one of them.
00:01:18.954,00:01:20.581,I signed off on your choices.
00:01:20.622,00:01:23.584,But I wouldn't have necessarily eliminated Gabriel based on the echo I saw.
00:01:23.625,00:01:27.046,A non-surgeon undermining a surgeon on his selection of surgical candidates.
00:01:27.086,00:01:30.007,It's healthy when colleagues challenge each others' decisions.
00:01:30.049,00:01:31.132,It doesn't make any sense.
00:01:31.174,00:01:32.217,We gave you good candidates.
00:01:32.259,00:01:33.260,You're not a doctor.
00:01:33.301,00:01:35.429,Why wouldn't you stick with the list?
00:01:35.470,00:01:38.139,There were several intangibles.
00:01:39.892,00:01:42.603,Can you say hi to Dr. Melendez?
00:01:42.644,00:01:46.356,"One of those intangibles, I'm guessing, is cuteness."

00:02:20.181,00:02:21.934,Kinda working on me.
00:02:23.769,00:02:26.647,"Before you say no, at least do your own work-up."
00:02:33.487,00:02:35.781,"Winnie: Mommy, why can't I come?"

00:02:38.700,00:02:40.368,"I won't, Mommy."
00:02:40.410,00:02:43.122,"I know, boo."
00:02:43.163,00:02:44.957,"Okay, baby."
00:02:47.167,00:02:48.418,I love you to the moon...
00:02:48.460,00:02:49.962,And back.
00:02:50.004,00:02:52.506,I can't imagine voice rest could be very easy with a 3-year-old.
00:02:57.636,00:02:59.972,"Grim irony, though, right?"

00:03:01.890,00:03:07.146,"Elizabeth, I'm sure the nodule will be benign and this'll be nothing more than an inspiration for another great episode."
00:03:07.186,00:03:09.314,"If it's not benign, Isabel?"
00:03:09.356,00:03:10.649,Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
00:03:10.691,00:03:13.360,Today we're just focused on removing the nodule and doing the biopsy.
00:03:13.401,00:03:14.569,And you've done everything you could do.
00:03:14.611,00:03:17.322,"And when the hoarseness started, you sought early care from the best."
00:03:17.364,00:03:18.365,And I sent you to the best.
00:03:18.406,00:03:22.661,"You work perfectly together, kind of ping and pong-ish."
00:03:22.703,00:03:24.121,Claire: It's nice.
00:03:24.163,00:03:26.957,A lot of doctors who are married are more like miss and match.
00:03:28.500,00:03:31.837,"Mrs. Bangura, this is Dr. Murphy and Dr. Kalu."
00:03:31.879,00:03:33.547,They're gonna help me run some tests on Gabriel.
00:03:34.882,00:03:37.718,Jared: I heard that you and Gabriel have never been away from home before.
00:03:37.759,00:03:39.344,I was hoping that these would make him feel welcome.
00:03:39.386,00:03:41.555,Georgieta: Yes.
00:03:43.140,00:03:46.518,"I brought one for myself, too."
00:03:46.560,00:03:48.729,"Hey, how 'bout we all do some medicine?"
00:04:02.201,00:04:03.911,He really needs our help.
00:04:10.291,00:04:12.086,He needs our help?
00:04:12.127,00:04:14.504,He sounds like he's got a blow dryer in his chest.
00:04:14.546,00:04:16.297,Exactly.
00:04:16.339,00:04:21.845,"This is the problem with cardiologists -- You're really good at telling people when something's broken, not so good at knowing when they can't be fixed."

00:04:24.765,00:04:25.766,You heard that heart.
00:04:25.807,00:04:26.808,I heard that heart.
00:04:26.850,00:04:28.518,And it sounded like crap.
00:04:28.560,00:04:32.231,"But until we do a transesophageal echo, I don't know anything."
00:04:39.988,00:04:42.157,Do a transesophageal echo.
00:04:42.199,00:04:49.915,"She has a master's degree in Sociology, impeccable credentials, excellent references, and you turned her away because her clothes didn't match?"
00:04:49.957,00:04:51.416,It's relevant.
00:04:55.963,00:04:57.881,But she's not gonna pick out your clothes for you.
00:04:57.923,00:04:59.382,She's not a nanny.
00:04:59.424,00:05:03.553,"She's there to help you with problem-solving, financial, social interactions."
00:05:03.595,00:05:07.849,You're doing this because I did not react well to a man with a gun robbing a store I was in.
00:05:07.891,00:05:11.228,"Statistically, that is very unlikely to ever happen to me again."
00:05:15.149,00:05:17.358,It's statistically irrefutable.
00:05:20.612,00:05:22.322,A happier life.
00:05:22.363,00:05:24.324,"If you don't like this woman, we'll find somebody else."
00:05:24.365,00:05:25.366,I am happy.
00:05:25.408,00:05:26.409,You could be happier.
00:05:26.451,00:05:27.869,I don't think so.
00:05:29.329,00:05:31.414,"My neighbor, Lea."
00:05:31.456,00:05:34.251,"If she were ever in a fire, she'd be rescued first."
00:05:34.293,00:05:35.961,Why's that?
00:05:36.003,00:05:38.588,Dr. Melendez says attractive people have advantages.
00:05:39.923,00:05:41.382,"Dr. Melendez says that, does he?"
00:05:41.424,00:05:42.676,Why is that funny?
00:05:44.303,00:05:49.016,"It's just, um, some people consider Dr. Melendez attractive."
00:05:49.057,00:05:50.892,"So, how's it going with Lea?"
00:05:51.977,00:05:53.728,She doesn't like me.
00:05:53.770,00:05:55.772,Claire: Why do you say that?
00:05:55.814,00:05:59.276,She said I was an asshat.
00:05:59.318,00:06:01.069,What was she doing when she said that?
00:06:01.111,00:06:04.156,Touching me.
00:06:04.198,00:06:07.617,Sometimes people say the opposite of what they mean.
00:06:07.659,00:06:13.999,"Um, they use teasing as a way of saying something they don't mean instead of saying something that they do."
00:06:14.041,00:06:18.003,I haven't seen any data on the use of antonyms as a flirting technique.
00:06:18.045,00:06:21.131,"Okay. Well, um, here's what to look for."
00:06:21.173,00:06:22.590,You ready?
00:06:22.632,00:06:24.301,Okay.
00:06:28.555,00:06:30.849,And the hair sweep.
00:06:33.060,00:06:36.563,"Hair scuffing is used in both animals and humans, Claire."
00:06:36.604,00:06:39.316,Secreting glands are located in the scalp and fur.
00:06:39.358,00:06:44.905,Scuffing sends hormones out into the environment to let a potential mate know they're interested.
00:06:46.114,00:06:48.407,Yeah.
00:06:48.449,00:06:50.660,I suppose you have to factor for that possibility.
00:06:53.288,00:06:55.414,Nice touch.
00:06:56.666,00:06:57.834,Happiness improves outlook.
00:06:57.876,00:06:59.294,Still on Mission Carpe Diem.
00:06:59.336,00:07:00.670,You might want to try it.
00:07:00.712,00:07:01.922,I'm doing fine.
00:07:01.963,00:07:03.298,We're having dinner at the sink.
00:07:06.885,00:07:08.636,Mm.
00:07:10.222,00:07:12.891,Andrews.
00:07:12.933,00:07:15.352,"Well, look again."
00:07:15.394,00:07:16.811,Yeah. Okay.
00:07:18.563,00:07:19.606,Who was that?
00:07:19.647,00:07:20.982,The lab.
00:07:21.024,00:07:23.235,They misplaced Elizabeth's specimen.
00:07:23.277,00:07:24.861,"Oh, my God."
00:07:24.903,00:07:27.281,Satisfied?
00:07:27.322,00:07:29.366,-It's somewhere.
00:07:32.535,00:07:33.954,"Well, double-checking can't hurt."
00:07:33.995,00:07:35.038,Actually it can.
00:07:35.080,00:07:37.832,Because you are here when you should be double-checking surgery.
00:07:37.874,00:07:40.043,I saw the specimen go in the container.
00:07:40.085,00:07:41.502,It means it has to be here.
00:07:41.544,00:07:44.298,"No, all that means is that it was put in a container."
00:07:44.339,00:07:49.510,It doesn't mean that that container was actually put in the surgery refrigerator or that it was actually picked up by the courier.
00:07:49.552,00:07:51.221,He's even worse than we thought.
00:07:51.263,00:07:52.973,Yeah.
00:07:53.014,00:07:59.646,"Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defect, abnormal insertion of the mitral valve leaflet."
00:07:59.687,00:08:02.649,I've never seen so many anomalies in one heart.
00:08:05.986,00:08:08.238,I'm sorry I pushed for additional testing.
00:08:08.280,00:08:11.950,That only got his mother's hopes up.
00:08:11.992,00:08:13.660,Any medication that'll help?
00:08:13.701,00:08:15.620,Beta blockers.
00:08:15.662,00:08:17.164,Maybe metoprolol.
00:08:17.205,00:08:21.001,"It's not like they'll get him playing soccer, but they might help him get to the field to watch."
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.128,"For a couple of years, anyway."
00:08:23.170,00:08:26.506,Better than dying on a table tomorrow.
00:08:26.547,00:08:29.009,You tell Aoki.
00:08:30.844,00:08:32.512,I'll break it to the mom.
00:08:38.352,00:08:40.354,Woman on P.A.: Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.
00:08:40.395,00:08:42.689,Dr. Lippman to plastic surgery.
00:08:52.740,00:08:57.120,"It's called sakara, given by our shaman."
00:08:59.664,00:09:01.624,His heartbeat...
00:09:01.666,00:09:04.127,it follows the sound.
00:09:08.048,00:09:11.592,"Mrs. Bangura, I've completed all the tests."
00:09:17.807,00:09:19.767,Invade his heart.
00:09:19.809,00:09:23.397,Our village shaman tried to rid them.
00:09:23.438,00:09:26.607,He could not.
00:09:26.649,00:09:30.028,Then a vision came to him.
00:09:30.070,00:09:34.366,A stronger healer would come.
00:09:34.408,00:09:37.577,You.
00:09:37.618,00:09:40.539,You will save Gabriel.
00:09:46.336,00:09:50.131,All I know is that your son was born with a heart that I can't fix.
00:09:50.173,00:09:51.425,I'm sorry.
00:09:51.466,00:09:55.345,I would not have come so far if I did not believe.
00:09:59.433,00:10:02.602,We'll give him medicine to make him feel better.
00:10:02.643,00:10:04.604,And then you can take him home.
00:10:26.834,00:10:31.923,"Claire: We tell her we're sorry, we have no news yet, and then -- Nope. You can't say that."
00:10:31.965,00:10:34.134,Sorry?
00:10:34.175,00:10:35.385,You can feel sorry.
00:10:35.427,00:10:36.803,"In fact, you should feel sorry."
00:10:36.844,00:10:38.096,You just can't say it.
00:10:38.138,00:10:41.975,"Okay, uh, I feel bad for you because we made a mistake and -- Nope."
00:10:42.016,00:10:43.977,A mistake isn't a mistake?
00:10:44.018,00:10:47.606,"Well, it's an unanticipated outcome of an expected action."
00:10:47.688,00:10:49.899,You can't use language that implies blameworthy conduct.
00:10:49.941,00:10:56.072,"But if we did lose the specimen, isn't it actually a mistake, and aren't we sorry, and aren't we blameworthy?"
00:10:56.114,00:10:59.951,Doesn't mean we can make it any easier for her attorney.
00:11:01.828,00:11:04.205,I'm Jessica Preston from Risk Management.
00:11:04.247,00:11:05.332,How are you?
00:11:05.373,00:11:06.625,I don't like the sound of that.
00:11:06.666,00:11:08.960,I know. I really need a new -- a new job title.
00:11:09.002,00:11:11.754,Seems that we've encountered an unexpected occurrence.
00:11:11.796,00:11:14.549,The laboratory has been unable to locate your tissue specimen.
00:11:14.591,00:11:19.387,"We don't want you to be unnecessarily alarmed, but we want you to be fully aware of what's going on."
00:11:19.429,00:11:23.766,But ho-- How will I know if I have cancer if you don't find it?
00:11:23.808,00:11:25.477,We are looking everywhere.
00:11:25.519,00:11:26.727,We will find it.
00:11:26.769,00:11:29.814,"As long as it's in formalin or a refrigerator, everything will be fine."
00:11:29.856,00:11:30.815,For how long?
00:11:30.857,00:11:33.234,At least 24 hours.
00:11:35.445,00:11:36.655,"Well, then you better find it."
00:11:38.948,00:11:43.286,Because I will be damned if I'm gonna have my voice box removed just because somebody screwed up.
00:11:47.706,00:11:50.544,I've implemented a proactive educational plan.
00:11:50.585,00:11:52.295,"Well, that's terrific, Shaun."
00:11:56.715,00:11:59.135,Why are we talking about that here?
00:11:59.177,00:12:01.429,I'm not stupid.
00:12:01.471,00:12:03.097,"I didn't say you were stupid, Shaun."
00:12:03.139,00:12:04.474,Nobody said you were stupid.
00:12:04.516,00:12:05.850,But sometimes you lack common sense.
00:12:05.892,00:12:07.268,I'm so sorry to have bothered you.
00:12:07.310,00:12:10.355,This patient is deaf.
00:12:10.397,00:12:11.814,Oh.
00:12:20.073,00:12:21.616,Flirting lessons.
00:12:21.658,00:12:23.577,Wish they'd had that when I was young.
00:12:23.618,00:12:27.163,"Yes, I learned about the flirting trifecta."
00:12:27.205,00:12:28.582,There's the pretentious giggle.
00:12:28.623,00:12:30.375,"Shaun, what are you getting at?"
00:12:30.417,00:12:36.548,"Flirting, it requires primarily nonverbal interactions."
00:12:41.219,00:12:43.346,You're studying flirting.
00:12:43.388,00:12:45.682,"Are you lonely, Shaun?"
00:12:45.724,00:12:51.521,'Cause you know there are -- There are websites now where you can -- I like being alone.
00:12:55.358,00:12:58.069,"Sometimes we're lonely, and we don't even know it."
00:12:58.111,00:13:01.780,How would I know it?
00:13:01.822,00:13:08.538,"Well, uh, loneliness, it's kind of a dull..."
00:13:08.580,00:13:09.664,It's like a dark...
00:13:09.706,00:13:11.332,Are you lonely?
00:13:14.294,00:13:17.297,"Yeah, sometimes."
00:13:17.338,00:13:19.798,"You know, sometimes very much."
00:13:23.511,00:13:25.179,You should learn the trifecta.
00:13:32.395,00:13:34.188,"Hey. Um, hey."
00:13:34.230,00:13:37.400,We're looking for a lost specimen that I am positive left the O.R.
00:13:37.442,00:13:38.901,And I'm positive it didn't make it to the lab.
00:13:38.943,00:13:43.114,"And since you're the link between the two, we wanted to ask you about your 3:00 run yesterday."
00:13:43.156,00:13:46.534,"So, you took everything that was in the refrigerator in the O.R.?"
00:13:46.576,00:13:48.202,"In the refrigerator, out of the refrigerator."
00:13:48.244,00:13:49.329,"Everything that's meant to go, I took."
00:13:49.370,00:13:51.331,Did you stop on the way?
00:13:51.372,00:13:53.916,"Straight from the surgery to the lab, just like the rules say."
00:13:53.958,00:13:57.712,"Well, did you stop at the restroom or the -- the coffee machine, the cafeteria?"
00:13:57.754,00:14:01.132,"You know, believe it or not, I can go a whole 30 minutes without stopping for a cream puff."
00:14:01.174,00:14:02.425,We're just desperate.
00:14:02.467,00:14:05.094,All we care about is the specimen and avoiding a full-on investigation.
00:14:05.136,00:14:07.263,Investigation?
00:14:07.305,00:14:10.183,Yeah.
00:14:10.224,00:14:13.478,"I-I-I-If we don't find it, then the legal department gets involved."
00:14:13.520,00:14:18.191,"Everyone who was in contact with it, who might have been in contact with it goes under a magnifying glass."
00:14:19.693,00:14:21.778,You looking forward to it?
00:14:21.820,00:14:23.780,"They're gonna check your social media, your computer."
00:14:23.822,00:14:26.282,Blood tests.
00:14:26.324,00:14:28.451,But if you find it before then...?
00:14:28.493,00:14:29.619,Then life goes on.
00:14:29.661,00:14:31.120,The same as it always has.
00:14:31.162,00:14:33.998,I did stop.
00:14:34.040,00:14:35.208,At the cafeteria.
00:14:35.249,00:14:37.544,The cashier is smokin'.
00:14:37.585,00:14:39.838,I might have been distracted for a little while.
00:14:39.879,00:14:42.089,Okay.
00:15:26.509,00:15:29.596,Water.
00:15:29.637,00:15:31.681,Always more water.
00:15:46.738,00:15:49.365,You are good with children.
00:15:50.991,00:15:52.118,No.
00:15:52.159,00:15:53.327,"One day, I hope."
00:16:20.772,00:16:22.273,"The meds should've improved his arrhythmia, not made it worse."
00:16:22.315,00:16:24.692,"Maybe in addition to his other problems, he's developed endocarditis."
00:16:24.734,00:16:28.279,His echo didn't reveal vegetations on his valves or...
00:16:28.321,00:16:30.573,endocardium.
00:16:30.615,00:16:32.700,He has not developed a fever.
00:16:32.742,00:16:34.160,Let's be sure.
00:16:35.620,00:16:36.663,It's in the wrong place.
00:16:43.085,00:16:44.963,It was in the wrong place.
00:16:45.004,00:16:47.340,Okay.
00:16:47.381,00:16:49.091,Times two.
00:16:58.726,00:17:00.019,Hey.
00:17:00.060,00:17:02.981,"Um, Leonard says that he stops by here to see you."
00:17:03.063,00:17:04.816,Yeah.
00:17:04.858,00:17:06.818,He pretends the cafeteria is on his route.
00:17:06.860,00:17:08.444,Like I don't know where the lab is.
00:17:08.486,00:17:10.070,"Yesterday around 3:00, Gwen."
00:17:10.112,00:17:12.532,Notice anything on the food trays that wasn't food?
00:17:12.573,00:17:14.408,Around 3:00?
00:17:14.450,00:17:20.915,"Just the usual -- uh, Tupperware, sunglasses, cellphones, a condom."
00:17:20.957,00:17:22.291,"Around 4:00, I found a glass eye."
00:17:24.002,00:17:27.129,"Uh, the ziplock bag with the red circles?"
00:17:27.171,00:17:29.423,Yeah.
00:17:29.465,00:17:31.258,C'mon.
00:17:34.762,00:17:37.390,You can move the mitral valve.
00:17:37.431,00:17:39.099,Thanks for the visual aid.
00:17:39.141,00:17:41.101,You can't move the mitral valve.
00:17:41.143,00:17:48.902,"Now, if Mr. Potato Head had an atrial septal nose and hypertrophic obstructive -- I believe -- I believe the abnormal insertion of the mitral valve can be -- Stop."
00:17:51.362,00:17:54.991,Follow me.
00:17:55.033,00:17:58.786,Pretty sure I saw a biohazard bag in here yesterday.
00:17:58.828,00:18:00.454,You're lucky you came when you did.
00:18:00.496,00:18:02.957,It's due to get dumped in two hours.
00:18:02.999,00:18:06.044,"Ugh, dentures."
00:18:06.085,00:18:09.088,"You know, every patient gets a denture cup with their name on it."
00:18:09.129,00:18:11.257,"So, tell me, why are the dentures never in the cup?"
00:18:11.298,00:18:13.133,"And if they are, it's the wrong cup?"
00:18:13.175,00:18:15.553,One of life's mysteries.
00:18:15.595,00:18:18.973,Biohazard bag sighting.
00:18:19.015,00:18:20.767,A biohazard bag for a coin purse?
00:18:20.808,00:18:21.768,Really?
00:18:24.062,00:18:31.778,"Finally, a septal myectomy will open the outflow tract, and the mitral valve can be re-implanted into a more normal position."
00:18:31.819,00:18:33.821,Thank you.
00:18:33.863,00:18:35.782,Can you do this procedure on Gabriel?
00:18:38.284,00:18:40.244,"It's a terrible idea, and it won't work."
00:18:40.286,00:18:42.162,"So, what was the point of this dog and pony show?"
00:18:42.204,00:18:44.707,'Cause you seemed keen on making medical decisions for me.
00:18:44.749,00:18:46.459,So just insubordination?
00:18:46.500,00:18:49.295,And we were probably gonna wind up coming to you anyway.
00:18:49.336,00:18:52.882,"Once Dr. Murphy gets an idea, he stays with it, regardless of what anyone says."
00:18:52.924,00:18:54.759,This can work.
00:18:54.801,00:18:57.177,"Yes, this can work."
00:18:57.219,00:19:00.306,And it would be a great idea if the boy had two hours to live.
00:19:00.347,00:19:03.559,Is fear of failure a good reason not to do this?
00:19:05.770,00:19:07.855,No.
00:19:10.066,00:19:13.027,The thought that he might have a few more birthdays...
00:19:13.069,00:19:15.029,or make a best friend.
00:19:15.071,00:19:16.990,And...I don't know.
00:19:17.031,00:19:19.408,I'm not sending him home in a box.
00:19:21.661,00:19:23.496,We got to go.
00:19:23.537,00:19:25.039,"Gabriel's arrhythmia, it's gotten worse."
00:19:26.457,00:19:28.042,Elizabeth: You still haven't found it?
00:19:28.084,00:19:32.254,I can get Ms. Preston to address any questions -- She wasn't in the surgery.
00:19:32.296,00:19:35.257,She is the point person for all therapeutic misadventures.
00:19:35.299,00:19:37.259,Are you kidding me?
00:19:37.301,00:19:42.807,"I may lose my voice for absolutely no reason, and you are using canned jargon."
00:19:42.849,00:19:47.353,"That sample cup doesn't have toothpaste or socks or sunblock in it, okay?"
00:19:47.394,00:19:48.896,It has my life!
00:19:53.400,00:19:55.153,I'm sorry.
00:19:57.446,00:19:58.906,Thank you.
00:20:05.121,00:20:07.832,Good for you.
00:20:07.874,00:20:10.334,I just broke about eight rules.
00:20:10.376,00:20:11.919,Ms. Preston won't hear about it from me.
00:20:14.130,00:20:15.840,"You should go find that sample, though."
00:20:17.508,00:20:18.926,Thanks.
00:20:22.180,00:20:26.142,The meds aren't working.
00:20:26.184,00:20:31.438,M-Maybe the arrhythmia is just another manifestation of Gabriel's L.V. dysfunction.
00:20:31.480,00:20:36.318,We should still be seeing at least a modest decline in his ectopy.
00:20:36.360,00:20:38.029,We could try calcium channel blockers.
00:20:38.071,00:20:40.447,There's a much simpler explanation.
00:20:51.250,00:20:53.127,His tests are normal.
00:20:55.379,00:20:58.758,"For some reason, his medication isn't helping."
00:20:58.799,00:21:01.052,Our best explanation is...
00:21:01.094,00:21:03.221,he hasn't been taking his medication.
00:21:17.944,00:21:19.946,I am trying to save his life.
00:21:19.987,00:21:21.072,But withholding his medicine?
00:21:21.114,00:21:23.699,By keeping him here.
00:21:23.741,00:21:27.369,"If he takes the medicine and becomes better, you send him to die."
00:21:27.411,00:21:29.914,But there is nothing else that we can do for him here.
00:21:29.956,00:21:34.627,"You do not understand where I live, what it is like."
00:21:34.668,00:21:37.713,I don't know your village.
00:21:37.755,00:21:39.757,But I do know what it's like to be poor.
00:21:41.634,00:21:43.552,I grew up with nothing.
00:21:43.594,00:21:44.845,My sister was disabled.
00:21:44.887,00:21:47.514,My parents couldn't afford her meds or treatments.
00:21:47.556,00:21:51.811,"And it killed them, and me, to watch her suffer."
00:21:51.852,00:21:56.857,"But when nothing can be done, nothing can be done."
00:21:56.899,00:21:59.485,You became a doctor?
00:22:01.361,00:22:03.906,You did not accept being poor.
00:22:03.948,00:22:06.533,No.
00:22:06.575,00:22:10.204,Then you do not understand at all.
00:22:13.124,00:22:16.085,We want for everything -- food.
00:22:16.127,00:22:20.131,Peace. Medicine.
00:22:20.173,00:22:24.760,But our greatest want is hope.
00:22:27.680,00:22:30.348,"If we leave here, we leave hope behind."
00:22:38.649,00:22:39.942,Okay.
00:22:39.984,00:22:42.820,I'll do what I can.
00:22:48.034,00:22:49.076,I dropped by to see Elizabeth.
00:22:49.118,00:22:50.536,"Not surprisingly, she's very upset."
00:22:52.330,00:22:53.455,If only people did their jobs.
00:22:53.497,00:22:54.790,Which people?
00:22:54.832,00:22:58.878,"Scrub nurses, couriers, lab techs..."
00:22:58.919,00:23:00.713,That's a curiously limited list.
00:23:02.173,00:23:05.509,"I don't think it's too much to expect others to do their jobs correctly, as well."
00:23:05.551,00:23:07.469,"So, not your fault, not your problem."
00:23:07.511,00:23:09.096,"What are you trying to do, make me feel guilty?"
00:23:09.138,00:23:11.265,Yes.
00:23:11.307,00:23:12.933,That's the only thing that's gonna make you change.
00:23:12.975,00:23:14.935,Into what?
00:23:14.977,00:23:17.646,The guy who cared more about patients than politics.
00:23:17.688,00:23:19.648,"Ah, okay, I get it."
00:23:19.690,00:23:22.235,This is about me vying for president of the hospital.
00:23:22.276,00:23:26.739,"Which we discussed at length, which you said you were 100% behind me on."
00:23:26.780,00:23:28.199,I didn't realize how far behind.
00:23:28.241,00:23:29.909,You think I've left you behind?
00:23:29.950,00:23:31.577,Hmm.
00:23:31.618,00:23:36.207,"Uh, Tuesday -- Capital expenditures meeting delayed."
00:23:36.249,00:23:37.457,Will be late.
00:23:37.499,00:23:39.085,Wednesday -- Fundraising event ran over.
00:23:39.126,00:23:40.753,Don't wait up.
00:23:40.794,00:23:43.756,"Thursday -- Iz, there are things about my job -- Right."
00:23:43.797,00:23:45.341,Not your fault.
00:23:58.687,00:24:01.190,Hey.
00:24:09.282,00:24:13.619,"Um, radioactive, medical device, forensic specimens -- all different?"
00:24:13.660,00:24:14.870,And all handled by different staff?
00:24:14.912,00:24:15.621,Did you know that?
00:24:15.662,00:24:18.207,Yes.
00:24:18.249,00:24:19.333,Oh.
00:24:19.375,00:24:21.627,"I made a chart, too."
00:24:21.668,00:24:24.130,A qualitative observation log of what you taught me.
00:24:24.171,00:24:25.131,What did I teach you?
00:24:25.172,00:24:26.924,Flirting.
00:24:26.966,00:24:33.347,"Every time I saw someone flirt, I noted it and cross-referenced the subject, object, and nonverbal gestures."
00:24:33.389,00:24:34.890,I knew it.
00:24:34.932,00:24:36.767,"Gwen, the cashier."
00:24:36.809,00:24:40.729,"She made out that it was all the courier, but -- That's my name."
00:24:40.771,00:24:42.273,Yes.
00:24:42.315,00:24:43.774,"No, I didn't."
00:24:43.816,00:24:46.360,You brushed your hair back.
00:24:46.402,00:24:49.947,"Right hand, side sweeping."
00:24:49.989,00:24:53.200,At Dr. Melendez?
00:24:53.242,00:24:56.120,"No, I don't think so."
00:24:57.663,00:25:04.003,"You were at the nurses station, and he said, Good for you, and you said, Yeah, right."
00:25:01.459,00:25:05.921,"I just broke about eight rules, and smiled and giggled and brushed your hair back."
00:25:08.799,00:25:10.508,Ms. Preston won't hear about it from me.
00:25:15.764,00:25:17.557,It's possible you have ringworm.
00:25:19.685,00:25:23.647,"Shaun, sometimes people toss their hair just 'cause it's in their face."
00:25:23.689,00:25:25.523,Melendez: Murphy.
00:25:25.565,00:25:26.984,I'd like you to elaborate on your idea.
00:25:27.026,00:25:28.777,"Mm, my terrible idea?"
00:25:28.819,00:25:29.862,That's the one.
00:25:43.667,00:25:47.129,You can move the anterior leaflet of the valve and reattach it.
00:25:47.171,00:25:50.216,"No, we can't."
00:25:50.257,00:25:55.888,"This is an exact replica of the kid's heart, and there's no anchor point to reattach it."
00:25:55.929,00:25:57.473,So that part of your idea is still terrible.
00:25:57.515,00:26:00.309,Okay.
00:26:00.351,00:26:01.643,But the rest of it?
00:26:04.980,00:26:06.315,What would that number be in a healthy kid?
00:26:06.357,00:26:07.774,About 8.
00:26:07.816,00:26:12.279,"If we go anywhere near that number, we won't have enough support for the valve."
00:26:14.490,00:26:18.618,But let's say we took that down to 20...
00:26:18.660,00:26:22.248,That won't be enough to relieve the outflow obstruction.
00:26:25.167,00:26:27.044,Okay.
00:26:27.086,00:26:28.628,18.
00:26:30.089,00:26:31.673,Okay.
00:27:25.561,00:27:26.604,Let's take him off bypass.
00:27:39.158,00:27:40.075,He's dead.
00:27:40.117,00:27:42.660,Again. 16.
00:27:42.702,00:27:44.955,Claire: I'm really tired.
00:27:44.997,00:27:51.295,I used to think that I wanted to be the best surgeon in history.
00:27:51.337,00:27:53.172,But my new goal?
00:27:53.213,00:27:56.800,Is just not to get washed out of my residency.
00:27:58.969,00:28:01.763,Claire: You have a surgery now?
00:28:01.805,00:28:02.889,No.
00:28:02.931,00:28:04.850,I'm here to see how I can help.
00:28:07.394,00:28:10.272,"Should I take a selfie, show my friends that this really happened?"
00:28:10.314,00:28:11.898,This is a team problem.
00:28:11.940,00:28:13.651,It should be a team solution.
00:28:13.691,00:28:15.819,How do you get a boss like this?
00:28:15.861,00:28:17.737,What do we know so far?
00:28:23.494,00:28:24.911,Let's take him off bypass.
00:28:36.173,00:28:39.593,His outflow is perfect at 13 millimeters.
00:28:39.635,00:28:42.513,Which is irrelevant when the mitral valve...
00:28:42.555,00:28:44.640,...doesn't have enough support to close.
00:28:44.682,00:28:48.185,He's dead.
00:28:48.227,00:28:49.728,Again.
00:28:51.355,00:28:52.814,Jessica: Dr. Browne.
00:28:56.860,00:29:00.322,told Elizabeth you were sorry?
00:29:00.364,00:29:02.241,Because I was.
00:29:06.203,00:29:08.706,"Well, I hope we don't see the price tag on that."
00:29:11.041,00:29:13.335,And I think you're out of time.
00:29:21.594,00:29:23.429,Let's take him off bypass.
00:29:35.023,00:29:36.567,Yes.
00:29:38.485,00:29:40.487,14 millimeters.
00:29:42.906,00:29:44.450,Yeah.
00:29:44.491,00:29:47.077,Exactly.
00:29:47.119,00:29:51.707,Our margin of error is exceedingly low.
00:29:51.749,00:29:54.251,Good luck.
00:29:54.293,00:29:56.378,You believe in luck?
00:29:56.420,00:29:59.839,It's something people say in difficult situations.
00:30:02.968,00:30:04.219,Neither do I.
00:30:04.261,00:30:05.262,Again.
00:30:07.431,00:30:14.062,"Isabel: The reality is, even if we found your specimen now, it's unlikely that it'd still be viable."
00:30:16.982,00:30:22.488,"You don't know if I have cancer, and there's no way to find out."
00:30:24.531,00:30:29.495,So my choices are surgery I may not need...
00:30:31.497,00:30:37.544,"...that will leave me without speech, or I do nothing and maybe die."
00:30:37.586,00:30:41.006,"Unfortunately, yes."
00:32:03.589,00:32:06.132,Knife.
00:32:21.273,00:32:23.108,"3 hours, 30 minutes."
00:32:23.149,00:32:25.277,You didn't want him on bypass any longer than five hours.
00:32:30.240,00:32:42.043,"Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, and Nod is a little head, and the wooden shoe that sailed the skies is a wee one's trundle-bed."
00:32:42.085,00:32:52.721,"eyes while Mother sings -- Melendez: How's it look, Dr. Murphy?"
00:32:56.015,00:32:58.351,14 millimeters.
00:32:58.393,00:33:00.312,Exactly.
00:33:00.353,00:33:01.354,Perfect.
00:33:04.566,00:33:06.693,His septal tissue...
00:33:11.281,00:33:14.033,It's stiffer than I anticipated.
00:33:22.334,00:33:24.795,I don't think this is gonna be enough for adequate outflow.
00:33:29.257,00:33:32.260,I'm taking the septum down to 13.
00:33:36.222,00:33:37.516,The patient died.
00:33:37.557,00:33:39.184,"That was a model, not a patient."
00:33:47.985,00:33:49.862,We're taking him down to 13.
00:33:56.451,00:33:59.120,Field.
00:33:59.162,00:34:02.248,All quiet for the time-out.
00:34:02.290,00:34:03.876,Patient is Elizabeth McLaren.
00:34:03.917,00:34:05.043,No known allergies.
00:34:05.084,00:34:08.922,We'll be doing a total laryngectomy with a Gluck Sorenson U-shaped incision.
00:34:08.964,00:34:09.882,Is everyone in agreement?
00:34:11.633,00:34:12.926,Antibiotics in?
00:34:12.968,00:34:14.761,One gram of cefotaxime has been infused.
00:34:14.803,00:34:16.095,We anticipate a specimen.
00:34:16.137,00:34:18.015,I've requested labels be printed.
00:34:18.056,00:34:20.183,Pen.
00:34:23.729,00:34:24.897,Dentures.
00:34:26.105,00:34:27.900,You've gotta hold the surgery.
00:34:27.941,00:34:30.527,Uh...just give me a little time.
00:34:35.448,00:34:37.659,That's 13.
00:34:43.790,00:34:46.084,Dammit.
00:34:46.125,00:34:48.503,Too thin?
00:34:48.545,00:34:52.883,The valve doesn't have adequate support.
00:34:52.925,00:34:54.676,It won't be able to close.
00:34:58.013,00:34:59.639,I was wrong.
00:35:13.862,00:35:15.072,Whoa.
00:35:15.113,00:35:18.075,There's a reattachment point.
00:35:18.116,00:35:22.454,We must not have seen it at 14 'cause it was obscured by the subvalvular tissue.
00:35:22.495,00:35:26.124,We can use that as an anchor point and move the valve.
00:35:26.165,00:35:28.543,Your terrible idea just got a hell of a lot better.
00:35:28.585,00:35:29.628,Stitch.
00:35:29.669,00:35:32.297,"5 hours, 23 minutes."
00:35:47.353,00:35:48.438,Hey.
00:35:48.480,00:35:49.773,Dentures.
00:35:49.815,00:35:52.859,"They always end up in the wrong cup, which is why they're so hard to get back to the owner."
00:35:54.402,00:35:56.071,What if the label on the specimen was wrong?
00:35:56.113,00:36:00.033,"What -- What if the nodule is here, but the container has the wrong name on it?"
00:36:00.075,00:36:03.829,"Okay, I'm reconciling the operative records to the surgery schedule to the specimen."
00:36:03.870,00:36:07.165,"I'll read the cases, check the containers, and feel like a jerk for judging you."
00:36:07.206,00:36:09.417,"Well, you're only a jerk if I'm right."
00:36:12.211,00:36:14.089,Pump time?
00:36:14.131,00:36:16.257,"6 hours, 48 minutes."
00:36:21.013,00:36:22.931,Get Mehta in here.
00:36:24.182,00:36:26.267,Let's take him off bypass.
00:36:55.881,00:36:56.965,12 seconds.
00:36:57.007,00:36:58.175,Should I get the paddles?
00:36:58.216,00:36:59.676,Not yet.
00:36:59.718,00:37:00.677,"Come on, Gabriel."
00:37:02.179,00:37:04.014,How long has he been on bypass?
00:37:04.056,00:37:05.431,Nearly two hours too long.
00:37:04.056,00:37:06.892,We need to jump-start -- Not yet!
00:37:15.441,00:37:16.442,Yeah.
00:37:16.484,00:37:18.570,Yes!
00:37:24.325,00:37:26.661,"Dr. Murphy, close him up."
00:37:48.850,00:37:53.730,It's beating just fine on its own.
00:38:05.742,00:38:07.619,Marcus.
00:38:23.093,00:38:31.392,"It was supposed to be used for a bullet removal, but they left the bullet in the body, and the cup was used accidentally for your specimen."
00:38:31.434,00:38:37.398,"Not only was it in formalin, but it was refrigerated and fresh as a daisy."
00:38:37.440,00:38:40.735,"Elizabeth, you don't have cancer."
00:38:46.825,00:38:49.702,Thank you.
00:38:49.744,00:38:52.038,Doctor.
00:39:08.972,00:39:10.515,Intangibles.
00:39:20.483,00:39:21.693,Hello.
00:39:21.734,00:39:23.195,Hello.
00:39:23.236,00:39:24.403,I had a very good day today.
00:39:24.445,00:39:25.404,"Yes, you did."
00:39:25.446,00:39:26.572,That was a hell of an operation.
00:39:26.614,00:39:27.824,Yes.
00:39:27.866,00:39:29.617,And I caught Claire flirting.
00:39:29.659,00:39:30.702,With you?
00:39:30.743,00:39:33.788,"Shaun, I think you might be mis-- With Dr. Melendez."
00:39:33.830,00:39:34.789,"Ah, Dr. Melendez."
00:39:34.831,00:39:38.626,"I conducted observations, successfully interpreted them, and logged them."
00:39:38.668,00:39:40.670,Romance in a spreadsheet.
00:39:40.712,00:39:42.339,I love it.
00:39:42.380,00:39:46.467,I was aware of the cues even when Claire wasn't.
00:39:46.509,00:39:48.928,I think she needs a life-skills coach.
00:39:48.970,00:39:50.096,Extrapolating.
00:39:50.138,00:39:51.139,"I like that, too."
00:39:51.181,00:39:52.515,"That's great, Shaun."
00:39:52.557,00:39:54.517,You're paying attention.
00:39:54.559,00:40:02.234,"And when we find you a life coach, one with a fashion sense, then you're gonna be learning better, you're gonna be learning faster."
00:40:05.028,00:40:07.530,Are you giving up on me?
00:40:07.572,00:40:10.200,What?
00:40:10.242,00:40:12.493,No.
00:40:12.535,00:40:15.330,I don't want a stranger helping me.
00:40:15.372,00:40:17.582,"I know, Shaun."
00:40:17.623,00:40:19.876,But...
00:40:23.046,00:40:24.463,I can't always be there.
00:40:24.505,00:40:25.924,I-I..
00:40:25.965,00:40:31.221,"I can't always help you the way you need to be helped, the way you deserve to be helped."
00:40:31.263,00:40:33.598,I don't want a stranger helping me.
00:40:46.319,00:40:47.695,Claire: Congratulations.
00:40:47.737,00:40:49.822,You too.
00:40:51.950,00:40:54.286,Something to fall back on if this surgery thing gets old.
00:40:56.495,00:40:58.415,"Jessica: You did a nice job, Claire."
00:40:58.456,00:41:00.917,Thanks.
00:41:00.959,00:41:02.252,We've been served.
00:41:02.294,00:41:04.712,But we found it.
00:41:04.754,00:41:06.047,I know.
00:41:06.089,00:41:09.842,"But we put her through two days of hell, and she wants to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else."
00:41:09.884,00:41:10.885,"I mean, good for her."
00:41:13.888,00:41:16.557,What is this?
00:41:16.599,00:41:18.476,Gabriel's pacemaker.
00:41:18.517,00:41:20.645,I heard you were brilliant again today.
00:41:22.605,00:41:23.689,I got lucky.
00:41:29.112,00:41:31.864,Do you think Armen would kill me if I got a pet hedgehog?
00:41:31.906,00:41:35.327,"I mean, I read that they're actually pretty -- Lea."
00:41:36.369,00:41:38.746,You look absurd in that sweater.
00:41:45.128,00:41:48.047,I have apples.
00:41:48.089,00:41:50.425,Do you want an apple?
00:41:52.510,00:41:54.887,Yeah.
00:00:10.093,00:00:11.303,Awesome.
00:00:11.345,00:00:13.555,I've never assisted on one of those before.
00:00:13.597,00:00:14.890,Dr. Andrews knows that.
00:00:14.932,00:00:16.391,That's why he's acting like it's Christmas morning.
00:00:16.433,00:00:19.227,"I'm guessing you've never operated on a pro athlete, either."
00:00:19.269,00:00:23.273,"Um, last time I checked, a couple means two, and there's three of us."
00:00:23.315,00:00:24.650,More good news.
00:00:24.692,00:00:29.989,Whoever isn't with us will be assisting Dr. Coyle on a double-leg fasciotomy.
00:00:31.156,00:00:32.491,Andrews: Feeling lucky?
00:00:34.493,00:00:36.161,Murphy.
00:00:36.203,00:00:39.164,VIP elbow. Sweet.
00:00:43.627,00:00:44.670,Whoo.
00:00:46.296,00:00:48.173,Bobby Ato?
00:00:48.215,00:00:49.717,He's a pro athlete?
00:00:49.758,00:00:51.385,He's a pro. I don't know if I'd call him in athlete.
00:00:51.426,00:00:53.470,-E-sports.
00:00:54.555,00:00:55.556,He's one of the best in the world.
00:00:55.597,00:00:58.934,"Last year, he won enough prize money to buy his mom a beach house in Monterey."
00:00:58.976,00:01:00.352,Paid cash.
00:01:00.394,00:01:06.066,Is he considered a very important person because he's an athlete or because he has a lot of money?
00:01:06.107,00:01:07.108,Both.Both.
00:01:07.150,00:01:09.028,Mm.
00:01:24.043,00:01:26.294,"Morning, Shaun."
00:01:26.336,00:01:31.174,"This is Melissa Bourne, the therapist that we talked about."
00:01:31.216,00:01:35.596,"That you agreed to meet with, right, Shaun?"
00:01:35.637,00:01:37.472,"Hi, Shaun."
00:01:39.140,00:01:40.559,H-H-Hi.
00:01:40.601,00:01:44.354,Dr. Glassman thought it would be a good idea for us to meet before our first in-home session.
00:01:44.396,00:01:46.105,Just to make sure you're comfortable.
00:01:46.147,00:01:47.733,I am not comfortable.
00:01:50.235,00:01:51.403,It's gonna be fine.
00:01:51.445,00:01:53.405,You two are going to like each other.
00:01:53.447,00:01:57.158,Dr. Bourne has a PhD in cognitive psychology.
00:01:57.200,00:01:59.661,"She can really help you, but you have to give her a chance."
00:02:03.832,00:02:05.250,Okay?
00:02:07.753,00:02:09.046,'Kay. Okay.
00:02:09.088,00:02:11.131,"I'm proud of you, Shaun."
00:02:11.172,00:02:13.383,I'm already proud of you.
00:02:25.980,00:02:39.660,-- Captions by VITAC -- Notice the separation at zero degrees.

00:02:43.497,00:02:45.457,A perfect candidate for surgery.
00:02:45.499,00:02:48.251,How's your mom?
00:02:48.293,00:02:49.795,"Oh, she's good, bro."
00:02:49.837,00:02:53.298,She said she gets checked out at the beach all the time ever since you did her breast reconstruction.
00:02:53.340,00:02:55.843,"So, uh, thanks."
00:02:55.884,00:02:58.095,We're gonna take good care of you.
00:02:58.137,00:02:59.847,See you in the O.R.
00:02:59.888,00:03:03.809,Which part of the UCL is the principal secondary restraint to excessive valgus movement?

00:03:05.727,00:03:07.186,"Yes, I'm fine."
00:03:08.563,00:03:09.982,I'm fine.
00:03:12.901,00:03:14.193,Squeeze my hands.

00:04:00.949,00:04:03.577,"Uh, Dr. Murphy."
00:04:03.618,00:04:05.495,What's wrong with you?
00:04:05.537,00:04:10.125,I have a condition called -- You're autistic.
00:04:10.167,00:04:12.753,"But what is wrong with you, bro?"
00:04:12.794,00:04:20.427,You gotta be legit smart to land a gig as a surgeon and he just shut you down like a noob.
00:04:20.468,00:04:24.556,I'll bring the idea up again.
00:04:24.598,00:04:26.100,They don't respect you.
00:04:27.642,00:04:29.937,And they should listen to you the first time.
00:04:29.978,00:04:32.439,-I can't control what they do.
00:04:33.899,00:04:35.609,It's about controlling your opponent.
00:04:35.650,00:04:37.277,You gotta find the right strategy.
00:04:37.318,00:04:38.737,It is not a game.
00:04:38.779,00:04:41.448,"Everything's a game, man."
00:04:41.489,00:04:45.619,"Just sometimes the stakes are higher, and this time it's my arm."
00:04:52.876,00:04:55.295,"So, I'm guessing you drew the short straw."
00:04:55.336,00:04:57.338,I beg your pardon?
00:04:55.336,00:04:59.133,"Well, you're here and your co-residents are on the VIP case."
00:04:59.174,00:05:02.136,I'm awesome and I'd still rather be with Melendez and Andrews.
00:05:02.177,00:05:04.638,"-No, it's fine -- -Relax. It's cool."
00:05:04.679,00:05:06.306,Tell me about our patient.
00:05:06.347,00:05:12.938,"Uh, 34-year-old female, software engineer and entrepreneur presenting with Compartment Syndrome caused by extreme overexertion at a spin class."
00:05:12.980,00:05:16.817,The condition has caused the muscles in her legs to -- -Okay. Great.
00:05:16.858,00:05:19.069,Finished enough to show me you're smart and thorough.
00:05:19.111,00:05:20.195,You know the treatment plan?
00:05:20.237,00:05:23.824,We need to make incisions on -- Good.
00:05:23.865,00:05:25.700,You take lead.
00:05:33.125,00:05:40.924,We need to make a number of long incisions down both sides of each leg to relieve the tension and return healthy circulation.
00:05:40.966,00:05:42.425,It's important we act quickly.
00:05:42.467,00:05:46.387,"If we don't get the swelling under control, the damage could be irreparable."
00:05:49.057,00:05:50.809,From working out too hard in a spin class?
00:05:50.851,00:05:53.312,"No, don't worry. Your sister's gonna be just fine."
00:05:53.352,00:05:55.814,"Look, I'm very confident we caught this in time."
00:05:57.191,00:05:58.775,If you could lean forward?
00:05:58.817,00:06:01.360,I just need to check your kidneys haven't been affected.
00:06:10.829,00:06:13.081,Extracting the palmaris now.
00:06:21.798,00:06:24.634,"Dr. Andrews, I read your op-ed in Gen Surge News."
00:06:24.676,00:06:26.636,Brilliant piece.
00:06:26.678,00:06:30.682,Never realized the lack of continuity of care was such a severe problem.
00:06:32.934,00:06:35.103,Dr. Melendez...
00:06:35.145,00:06:37.147,you have very beautiful hair.
00:06:38.732,00:06:39.733,Thank you.
00:06:39.774,00:06:46.405,"Given the patient's grip weakness, we could do a nerve conduction test to rule out any concurrent nerve damage."
00:06:46.447,00:06:47.657,No.
00:06:49.701,00:06:52.329,"Okay, that looks like a good stopping point."
00:06:52.371,00:06:55.165,Dr. Kalu...step in.
00:06:56.208,00:06:58.585,-Something wrong?
00:06:58.626,00:07:01.963,I just want to give Dr. Kalu an opportunity to show us what he can do.
00:07:02.005,00:07:03.340,As long as that's okay with you.
00:07:04.299,00:07:05.384,Sure.
00:07:05.424,00:07:07.594,"-Thank you, Dr. Andrews."
00:07:27.072,00:07:29.699,"All right, looking good."
00:07:29.741,00:07:32.286,Let's move to the lateral side.
00:07:32.327,00:07:34.371,"So, what are we doing tonight, ladies?"
00:07:34.413,00:07:36.873,How about we go to Viva's?
00:07:36.915,00:07:38.625,Sounds good.
00:07:38.666,00:07:39.960,Bovie.
00:07:41.378,00:07:43.338,"You're awfully quiet over there, Dr. Browne."
00:07:43.380,00:07:44.965,I'm just focused.
00:07:45.006,00:07:49.261,"I know you're used to operating with Melendez, but we have fun here."
00:07:49.303,00:07:52.597,"I feel like when it's less tense, people make fewer mistakes."
00:07:52.639,00:07:54.433,Okay.
00:07:54.474,00:07:56.059,You wanna take the other leg?
00:07:57.560,00:08:00.314,Really?
00:08:00.355,00:08:02.023,Definitely.
00:08:02.065,00:08:03.108,So go for it.
00:09:40.955,00:09:42.749,"Shaun, good morning."
00:09:42.790,00:09:44.959,"Good morning, Dr. Glassman."
00:09:46.627,00:09:48.255,How'd it go with Melissa?
00:09:48.296,00:09:49.839,She was...
00:09:49.881,00:09:51.716,very helpful.
00:09:53.134,00:09:55.053,"You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday, Shaun."
00:09:55.095,00:09:57.264,After you.
00:10:05.730,00:10:08.733,Apparently we are at an impasse.
00:10:08.775,00:10:11.819,I feel strongly that Melissa can be very helpful to you.
00:10:11.861,00:10:18.076,You feel so strongly that she can't that you're willing to sacrifice a good night's sleep and hygiene.
00:10:18.118,00:10:20.161,"Shaun, you smell."
00:10:23.831,00:10:26.793,I will shower in the doctor's lounge.
00:10:26.834,00:10:30.171,"Well, great."
00:10:30.213,00:10:33.300,You stayed here all night just to avoid a confrontation.
00:10:35.427,00:10:36.595,You know? Just say no.
00:10:36.636,00:10:38.805,No!
00:10:38.846,00:10:39.973,No.
00:10:40.014,00:10:42.725,Great. That's just great.
00:10:42.767,00:10:44.144,I don't have to see Melissa?
00:10:44.185,00:10:46.771,"No, you don't have to see Melissa."
00:10:46.813,00:10:48.982,You're a grown man.
00:10:49.023,00:10:52.527,I just happen to feel that she could be of great help to you.
00:10:55.029,00:10:57.407,I'll tell you what.
00:10:57.449,00:11:03.371,You see Melissa three times and I will buy you the surround-sound system you want for your television.
00:11:03.413,00:11:04.664,Are you bribing me?
00:11:04.705,00:11:07.041,I suppose I am.
00:11:08.627,00:11:10.253,"If you don't like her, she'll leave."
00:11:10.295,00:11:13.965,And I promise I will never say another word about it.
00:11:14.007,00:11:15.967,That's a pretty good deal.
00:11:21.389,00:11:22.599,Okay.
00:11:22.641,00:11:24.184,Okay.
00:11:25.810,00:11:27.686,I will meet with her tonight.
00:11:27.728,00:11:29.356,"That's good, Shaun."
00:11:41.117,00:11:44.371,Saline? I've never seen it done quite like that.
00:11:44.412,00:11:47.040,"Yeah, I had a professor from Portugal."
00:11:47.081,00:11:50.293,Apparently it's how they do it over there.
00:11:50.335,00:11:52.128,It's supposed to lessen the pain.
00:11:52.170,00:11:55.549,"Well, the good news is your tissue is nice and pink, which means it's healthy."
00:11:55.590,00:11:58.552,"Unfortunately, the swelling is not coming down like we'd hoped."
00:11:58.593,00:12:01.012,Does this mean you're going to have to amputate?
00:12:01.054,00:12:03.431,"No, no."
00:12:03.473,00:12:04.516,We'll take care of you.
00:12:06.226,00:12:08.562,"Very nice work, Dr. Browne."
00:12:17.862,00:12:19.155,Hey.
00:12:19.197,00:12:22.033,Can you do me a solid and trade patients?
00:12:22.075,00:12:24.494,"No, not a chance."
00:12:24.536,00:12:26.413,"Coyle let me take lead, too."
00:12:26.454,00:12:28.707,So what is the problem?
00:12:33.336,00:12:35.088,He patted my back in a weird way.
00:12:35.129,00:12:36.839,I don't know.
00:12:36.881,00:12:39.050,I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.
00:12:40.510,00:12:41.844,Maybe?
00:12:41.886,00:12:43.971,I don't...
00:12:44.013,00:12:45.890,Shaun? Switch?
00:12:45.932,00:12:47.350,Shaun: No.
00:12:47.392,00:12:49.102,I like Bobby.
00:12:49.143,00:12:51.145,He has very good advice.
00:12:55.692,00:12:57.110,"So, who did what?"
00:12:57.151,00:13:03.032,"Well, I did, uh, most of the surgery along with Dr. Andrews and Dr. Kalu aided in replacing one of your torn ligaments."
00:13:03.074,00:13:05.493,You should be back in competition shape in a few weeks time.
00:13:07.203,00:13:08.996,What about you?
00:13:09.038,00:13:12.959,I helped to clean the grafted tendons.
00:13:13.000,00:13:14.961,Ah. That's it.
00:13:15.002,00:13:16.879,Yes.
00:13:16.921,00:13:18.381,Come on.
00:13:22.761,00:13:32.979,Y-Your muscle weakness along with the high body temperature could be an early indicator of multiple sclerosis.
00:13:36.232,00:13:37.984,We should order an MRI.
00:13:38.025,00:13:40.153,We have talked about this countless times.
00:13:40.194,00:13:42.821,Yes.
00:13:42.863,00:13:44.574,We are not ordering an MRI.
00:13:44.616,00:13:45.950,You don't respect me.
00:13:45.992,00:13:47.452,"Not right now, I don't."
00:13:47.494,00:13:49.287,"Dr. Andrews, Dr. Melendez."
00:13:49.329,00:13:53.166,"Given the fact we're dealing with a pro athlete, even the slightest hiccup could be problematic."
00:13:53.207,00:13:56.753,I think Bobby would be impressed by our being extra attentive.
00:13:58.129,00:14:00.590,Kalu is right -- he is a pro athlete in his prime earning years.
00:14:00.632,00:14:03.926,We should make sure we leave him 100%.
00:14:08.139,00:14:09.307,Do the MRI.
00:14:13.978,00:14:16.731,Nice score.
00:14:16.773,00:14:18.483,Do the MRI.
00:14:18.525,00:14:21.361,"No, Jared did."
00:14:21.402,00:14:23.822,How did he get there when you couldn't?
00:14:23.863,00:14:25.448,He asked nicely.
00:14:25.490,00:14:27.450,"Okay, you asked nicely."
00:14:27.492,00:14:30.704,"Yes. Yes, I did."
00:14:30.745,00:14:33.247,"You gotta be fierce if you want the glory, bro."
00:14:33.289,00:14:34.582,"Oh, no."
00:14:34.624,00:14:37.168,"I do not want the glory, bro."
00:14:37.210,00:14:39.879,I just want to be a good surgeon.
00:14:39.920,00:14:41.214,Everyone wants glory.
00:14:43.049,00:14:46.010,And everybody's got wants.
00:14:46.052,00:14:50.598,I want a surround-sound speaker system.
00:14:52.141,00:14:54.185,"To get it, I have to see a therapist."
00:14:54.227,00:14:56.437,I don't want to have to see a therapist.
00:14:56.479,00:15:00.692,"Okay, yeah, that's -- that's how I got my first PS2."
00:15:00.734,00:15:03.944,"Yeah, my parents bribed me to go to therapy after they split up."
00:15:03.986,00:15:05.864,What was therapy like?
00:15:05.905,00:15:06.865,"Pretty basic, bro."
00:15:06.906,00:15:08.949,"She'd tell me what to do, how to deal with my parents."
00:15:08.991,00:15:10.243,Was it helpful?
00:15:10.284,00:15:11.411,I don't know.
00:15:11.452,00:15:14.080,I never did anything she told me to do.
00:15:14.121,00:15:16.499,Is that an option?
00:15:16.541,00:15:20.754,Doing whatever the hell you feel like doing is always an option.
00:15:26.551,00:15:31.598,Just a gentle reminder -- dinner with my dad tonight at 8:00.
00:15:32.932,00:15:36.310,"So was the Gypsy Kings concert, and I -- I seem to remember..."
00:15:38.396,00:15:40.523,How is the VIP case?
00:15:40.565,00:15:43.443,Shaun seems off about something.
00:15:46.821,00:15:48.489,And Andrews is...
00:15:48.531,00:15:49.908,He's a pain in your ass.
00:15:49.949,00:15:52.410,No.
00:15:55.162,00:15:58.625,"Well, ass kissing is a useful skill for a surgeon."
00:15:58.666,00:16:00.084,That's a very beautiful blouse.
00:16:00.126,00:16:01.335,to go to dinner?
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.632,You'll have some nice wine and my dad will pay.
00:16:07.341,00:16:08.468,April 25th.
00:16:08.509,00:16:09.552,Did you book something?
00:16:09.594,00:16:10.720,No.
00:16:10.762,00:16:14.140,But my dad doesn't need to know that.
00:16:17.017,00:16:18.394,What do you got?
00:16:18.436,00:16:21.314,Looks like the surgically repaired elbow is fine.
00:16:21.355,00:16:22.607,As I suspected.
00:16:22.649,00:16:26.360,"But Murphy noticed something in the periphery, a little higher up, just above the bicep."
00:16:26.402,00:16:28.154,It was my idea.
00:16:28.195,00:16:30.698,"Yes, I just said that."
00:16:30.740,00:16:34.201,"So, we took an image from higher up and noticed this."
00:16:36.203,00:16:39.791,It's encasing the entirety of his brachial plexus.
00:16:44.420,00:16:46.172,This thing is massive.
00:16:46.213,00:16:48.424,Biopsy indicated it's definitely a schwannoma.
00:16:48.466,00:16:50.927,And it's definitely malignant.
00:16:50.969,00:16:53.680,"It's in a tricky spot, but you might be able to remove it."
00:16:53.721,00:16:58.267,Follow it up with a combo of radiotherapy and chemo to finish it o...
00:17:00.353,00:17:01.896,What?
00:17:01.938,00:17:05.525,Robert Ato. Bobby Ato.
00:17:05.566,00:17:06.526,You a fan?
00:17:06.567,00:17:07.902,I met three years ago.
00:17:07.944,00:17:10.237,Oncology consult for SF Muni.
00:17:12.782,00:17:15.159,He had cancer three years ago?
00:17:22.249,00:17:25.127,Why the hell wouldn't you tell us that you had already had cancer?
00:17:25.169,00:17:26.420,It was in my lower leg three years ago.
00:17:26.462,00:17:28.172,How's that gonna change how you fix my elbow?
00:17:31.467,00:17:35.054,to Dr. Murphy because you don't respect him.
00:17:35.095,00:17:36.305,'Cause Dr. Murphy is different.
00:17:36.347,00:17:37.557,I respect him.
00:17:37.598,00:17:39.392,"He has good ideas, and he has bad ideas."
00:17:39.433,00:17:41.394,Turns out this was a good one.
00:17:41.435,00:17:44.564,Why did you hide the truth?
00:17:44.605,00:17:48.026,A previous cancer diagnosis isn't shameful.
00:17:55.408,00:18:00.997,"After the first diagnosis, all I was thinking was, Will it come back?"
00:18:01.039,00:18:03.583,How bad will it be?
00:18:03.624,00:18:04.751,"I was distracted, man."
00:18:04.792,00:18:09.756,"I couldn't focus, and I hit a slump -- Wait, you were worried that cancer was messing with your gaming?"
00:18:09.797,00:18:11.841,"Yeah, man!"
00:18:11.883,00:18:13.509,It cost me a championship.
00:18:13.551,00:18:22.142,"I decided to block it out along with all the thoughts of negativity and physical weakness, and like that, I became the best in the world."
00:18:25.855,00:18:31.945,We need to do a full-body scan to make sure the cancer has not already metastasized.
00:18:31.986,00:18:34.321,What he said.
00:18:37.241,00:18:39.118,What I said.
00:18:40.244,00:18:43.372,This looks great.
00:18:43.414,00:18:45.583,The swelling is starting to reduce.
00:18:45.625,00:18:47.085,We can start tightening the sutures.
00:18:47.126,00:18:50.755,Finally some good news.
00:18:50.797,00:18:52.548,"You look like you're doing better, too..."
00:18:55.259,00:18:58.345,Dr. Coyle? He's fine.
00:19:00.347,00:19:02.349,Trust me. I get it.
00:19:02.391,00:19:13.069,"I almost rode myself to death in a spin class because I overheard a couple of investors say that they liked the concept just fine, but that my cankles were too distracting."
00:19:13.111,00:19:16.030,What?
00:19:16.072,00:19:18.741,And you're beautiful.
00:19:20.660,00:19:30.753,"You got the face, perfect little hip-to-waist ratio, and most VC firms are run by a bunch of bros, so there is an inverse relationship between the size of my ass and how much money I can raise."
00:19:30.795,00:19:34.048,Then you should do something else where you don't have to deal with bros.
00:19:34.090,00:19:35.633,"Like what, become a nun?"
00:19:37.384,00:19:39.386,-Sorry.
00:19:39.428,00:19:43.141,She nearly worked herself to death trying to please some pigs with money?
00:19:43.182,00:19:44.308,She shouldn't have to.
00:19:44.350,00:19:46.226,Great. Let me know when you find utopia.
00:19:46.268,00:19:49.105,"But until then, I love what I do."
00:19:49.147,00:19:55.987,"So I got to play the game 'cause if I call them out, I just get labeled a bitch, or even worse."
00:19:56.029,00:19:57.279,Your heart rate's going up.
00:19:58.322,00:19:59.615,-Hazel?
00:19:59.657,00:20:01.951,Hazel?
00:20:01.993,00:20:03.870,She's barely moving any air.
00:20:03.911,00:20:05.579,"Hazel, can you hear me?"
00:20:05.621,00:20:07.498,Code blue!
00:20:07.540,00:20:09.625,Give me a laryngoscope and an ET tube.
00:20:09.667,00:20:11.961,Let's get her on 100% oxygen.
00:20:12.003,00:20:14.755,Code blue.
00:20:18.176,00:20:19.135,Talk to me.
00:20:19.177,00:20:22.471,Her lungs -- I think it's a reperfusion injury.
00:20:22.513,00:20:24.515,There's no room in here.
00:20:24.557,00:20:27.101,"Mallampati 3, maybe 4."
00:20:27.143,00:20:29.937,You're doing fine.
00:20:34.608,00:20:36.485,You feel the epiglottis?
00:20:40.198,00:20:42.533,"It stopped, got it."
00:20:46.245,00:20:48.455,It's gonna be okay.
00:20:53.044,00:20:54.212,"Strong work, Doctor."
00:20:58.841,00:21:00.843,"Best in the world or not, this guy's insane."
00:21:00.885,00:21:03.596,Hiding from a diagnosis?
00:21:03.637,00:21:07.683,Doesn't work -- it'll find you.
00:21:07.725,00:21:11.687,Bobby wanted to be the best.
00:21:11.729,00:21:12.980,I don't think he was trying to be the best.
00:21:13.022,00:21:14.148,I think he was just scared.
00:21:21.739,00:21:24.742,"Oh, another schwannoma."
00:21:26.119,00:21:28.621,So much for the power of positive thinking.
00:21:38.172,00:21:40.633,Stopped going to follow-ups because he started losing.
00:21:40.674,00:21:41.717,What's so strange?
00:21:44.762,00:21:46.097,I was thinking we could try something new.
00:21:46.139,00:21:47.431,Maybe gamma knife?
00:21:51.978,00:21:57.108,What if I told you every few months that you had a real possibility you were gonna die?
00:21:57.150,00:22:00.486,I'd be scared.
00:22:00.527,00:22:03.030,"Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't."
00:22:03.072,00:22:08.327,"Personally, I think he's right -- shut down those voices of doom, spend your days living instead of dying."
00:22:08.368,00:22:10.163,But he may also be crazy.
00:22:12.498,00:22:15.876,"Short of making him a vegetable, I don't know if there's anything we can do."
00:22:20.298,00:22:22.508,Is -- Is Shaun okay?
00:22:24.468,00:22:25.761,Is his work okay?
00:22:25.803,00:22:28.388,"Yes, I just, um -- Then he's fine."
00:22:49.994,00:22:51.204,Horse walks into a bar.
00:22:51.245,00:22:54.707,Bartender says...
00:22:54.748,00:22:56.334,We found another mass.
00:22:56.374,00:22:59.962,"That's not how it goes, but cool."
00:23:00.004,00:23:01.130,"Let's knock it out, too."
00:23:01.172,00:23:03.174,The mass is located on your brain stem.
00:23:03.216,00:23:08.721,"Which controls your autonomic nervous system -- your heart, respiration."
00:23:08.762,00:23:11.473,Its positioning makes it inoperable.
00:23:26.822,00:23:32.203,"Wish it was longer, but..."
00:23:32.245,00:23:34.663,I'm gonna go out on top.
00:23:37.083,00:23:42.963,"If you went out today, could you say the same thing?"
00:23:53.849,00:23:56.060,She's lucky you were there.
00:23:56.102,00:23:58.604,Me?
00:23:58.645,00:24:00.814,With your help.
00:24:00.856,00:24:02.733,"So, thank you."
00:24:07.947,00:24:09.198,Maybe take the edge off?
00:24:09.240,00:24:12.368,No.
00:24:12.410,00:24:15.371,Are you sure?
00:24:15.413,00:24:17.706,I give great massages.
00:24:21.668,00:24:23.754,That's really inappropriate.
00:24:23.796,00:24:25.756,I said no.
00:24:25.798,00:24:28.466,Where's this coming from?
00:24:28.508,00:24:30.219,You were -- You were clearly giving me signals.
00:24:30.261,00:24:34.598,"No, the only signal I gave you was that I wasn't interested in the slightest."
00:24:34.640,00:24:40.646,"Okay, see, I just -- I heard about you and Kalu banging in the call room, so I figured -- This conversation is over."
00:24:40.687,00:24:44.358,"I'm pretty easygoing, but you're approaching insubordination."
00:24:46.277,00:24:47.736,You're gonna report me?
00:24:47.778,00:24:49.822,I'm not gonna report anybody.
00:24:49.863,00:24:53.784,"But maybe next time, try not to have such a stick up your ass about being asked out."
00:25:00.791,00:25:01.959,"Oh, come on."
00:25:02.001,00:25:03.752,I always thought Bunny was the cutest nickname.
00:25:03.794,00:25:08.090,"Of course you did, but you could've stopped calling me that when I was 12 or -- or 20."
00:25:10.301,00:25:12.136,Rough day?
00:25:14.596,00:25:17.683,Yeah.
00:25:17.724,00:25:20.436,"Well, this should make you a little happier."
00:25:20.478,00:25:24.106,I have decided to take care of your entire wedding.
00:25:24.148,00:25:25.649,We don't need it.
00:25:27.109,00:25:28.486,You're welcome.
00:25:29.903,00:25:32.281,We're more than capable of paying for our own wedding.
00:25:32.323,00:25:33.949,We make good money.
00:25:33.991,00:25:37.161,"But you won't once you start having kids, Bunny."
00:25:52.176,00:25:55.679,What are you doing in here?
00:25:55.721,00:25:58.807,I'm hiding from my therapist.
00:25:58.849,00:26:02.978,I am not going to get a surround-sound speaker system.
00:26:03.020,00:26:06.023,But I am doing whatever the hell I feel like doing.
00:26:06.065,00:26:07.274,Mm-hmm.
00:26:07.316,00:26:08.901,Can you hand me that mop?
00:26:08.942,00:26:10.486,"Hmm, okay."
00:26:16.700,00:26:20.829,Are you satisfied with what you've done with your life?
00:26:22.706,00:26:25.459,Would you be happy if you died tomorrow?
00:26:25.501,00:26:28.170,"Uh, satisfied?"
00:26:28.212,00:26:30.339,Happy?
00:26:30.381,00:26:35.261,"I clean up a building, uh..."
00:26:35.302,00:26:37.513,But I -- I married the love of my life.
00:26:37.555,00:26:41.559,"Uh, we raised three beautiful kids."
00:26:41.599,00:26:46.188,"One of them had some troubles, but she's doing great now."
00:26:49.733,00:26:51.777,And I was good to people.
00:26:51.818,00:26:53.904,At least I think I was.
00:26:56.198,00:26:58.576,That's a very good answer.
00:27:02.288,00:27:06.083,I got pictures of the girls if you want see -- No.
00:27:07.876,00:27:10.628,"So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?"
00:27:10.670,00:27:11.838,Agreed.
00:27:11.880,00:27:14.091,She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.
00:27:14.133,00:27:16.676,"Yes, she can, but why?"
00:27:20.222,00:27:22.391,"You should be enjoying life, like me."
00:27:22.433,00:27:23.892,There's plenty in the family trust.
00:27:23.934,00:27:26.479,"Dad, my work is important."
00:27:23.934,00:27:29.106,I'm helping people -- Bunny...
00:27:29.148,00:27:31.525,How -- How is that really helping anyone?
00:27:31.567,00:27:33.360,"And maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't get it."
00:27:33.402,00:27:35.237,I-I thought you were smarter than that.
00:27:35.279,00:27:40.826,You'd prefer her to be a lazy parasite living off a trust fund as opposed to actually contributing to society?
00:27:40.867,00:27:42.244,Parasite?
00:27:44.204,00:27:46.540,My father made a lot of money.
00:27:46.582,00:27:48.750,I'm not going to apologize for that.
00:27:48.792,00:27:53.297,He made sure his children and his grandchildren could enjoy their lives.
00:27:54.672,00:27:58.594,"In fact, I go out of my way to help people."
00:27:58.636,00:28:03.681,So I'm sorry if that doesn't qualify me as a worthwhile person in your book.
00:28:06.435,00:28:08.187,I'll get the check on my way out.
00:28:08.228,00:28:11.231,"Dad, you don't have to..."
00:28:40.594,00:28:42.638,I don't know.
00:28:49.769,00:28:52.981,"encouraging, I've tried being supportive, I've tried bribing you."
00:28:53.023,00:28:56.985,I don't need a therapist.
00:28:57.027,00:28:59.112,Look around you.
00:28:57.027,00:29:01.948,"What -- You're sleeping -- What is this, a broom closet?"
00:29:01.990,00:29:06.995,Look at the sacrifices you're willing to make just to avoid...
00:29:13.752,00:29:15.754,We're gonna pick this up later.
00:29:19.258,00:29:21.301,You have to file a complaint with HR.
00:29:21.343,00:29:26.932,"I do that and I get labeled hostile and difficult, neither of which work with my complexion or gender."
00:29:26.973,00:29:28.642,All the more reason to take a stand.
00:29:28.684,00:29:31.144,"Claire, this situation is exactly what HR is for."
00:29:31.186,00:29:32.688,I didn't say it was easy.
00:29:32.730,00:29:33.939,"Yeah, you did."
00:29:33.980,00:29:38.193,"Look, it's scary and it takes courage, but it's the right thing to do."
00:29:38.235,00:29:40.987,They'll listen to you.
00:29:41.029,00:29:42.698,Like you did.
00:29:42.740,00:29:47.160,"How did I -- I came to you, you accused me of exaggerating to get back onto the case."
00:29:47.202,00:29:50.247,"No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I had no idea -- I said he was too friendly."
00:29:54.752,00:29:58.255,"I'm sleeping with you, Jared, and you thought I was overreacting."
00:29:58.297,00:30:01.007,How do you think three strangers will see things?
00:30:05.804,00:30:07.681,"Claire, I'm sorry."
00:30:07.723,00:30:10.183,Don't worry about it.
00:30:10.225,00:30:11.977,I've got a patient to round on.
00:30:14.146,00:30:21.945,Dr. Melendez and I had a talk and we believe we can excise the tumor if you're willing to make a sacrifice.
00:30:21.987,00:30:24.782,Sacrifice?
00:30:24.823,00:30:26.158,That sounds better than death.
00:30:26.199,00:30:28.702,My thinking as well.
00:30:28.744,00:30:34.082,"We believe we can remove the mass, but we'll also have to take a piece out of your brain stem."
00:30:34.124,00:30:38.545,"A chunk of the red nucleus, which helps control the left side of your body."
00:30:38.587,00:30:41.548,You'll be paralyzed on that side.
00:30:41.590,00:30:45.885,It could also result in difficulty eating and swallowing.
00:30:45.927,00:30:48.013,Speech difficulties.
00:30:52.225,00:30:53.602,Let's do it.
00:30:53.644,00:30:55.354,Good for you.
00:30:58.816,00:31:01.568,"Bobby, this is very risky surgery."
00:31:01.610,00:31:06.198,"You could die on the table, and even if all goes well, you will be severely disabled."
00:31:06.239,00:31:09.368,"Yeah, I -- I was listening, and I'm in."
00:31:18.627,00:31:22.047,"Guys, hey, I get it."
00:31:22.088,00:31:25.634,"If I'm dead, I'm -- I'm dead."
00:31:25.676,00:31:31.056,"But if not -- PT, relearning stuff, whatever."
00:31:31.097,00:31:34.518,It's not gonna stop me from competing.
00:31:34.560,00:31:36.770,Not ever.
00:31:36.812,00:31:40.232,"Bobby, your career is over."
00:31:40.273,00:31:42.275,We need you to understand that.
00:31:49.949,00:31:51.159,Yeah?
00:31:59.752,00:32:02.045,"Once a gamer, always a gamer, huh?"
00:32:03.589,00:32:05.674,You got my respect.
00:32:23.275,00:32:24.359,What the hell is your problem?
00:32:24.401,00:32:32.659,"If you ever threaten Claire, take a disrespectful tone, or so much as look at her cross-eyed again, I'm gonna do a hell of a lot more than put you up against a wall."
00:32:32.701,00:32:33.993,We clear?
00:32:45.714,00:32:49.509,Your lungs are looking a lot better.
00:32:59.978,00:33:01.563,Thank you.
00:33:01.605,00:33:03.273,You're welcome.
00:33:03.315,00:33:05.859,All part of the service.
00:33:05.901,00:33:09.863,And good for you.
00:33:09.905,00:33:12.491,I wasn't sleeping.
00:33:17.120,00:33:20.165,You heard that?
00:33:21.875,00:33:24.210,I wish I had done that.
00:33:24.252,00:33:25.712,You were brave.
00:33:25.754,00:33:29.466,"No, no."
00:33:42.729,00:33:44.606,Who?
00:33:44.648,00:33:46.232,"Come on, man."
00:33:46.274,00:33:49.736,And there is the tumor capsule.
00:33:49.778,00:33:52.739,Richie Parker.
00:33:52.781,00:33:55.742,Isn't he a NASCAR guy?
00:33:55.784,00:33:56.910,Born without arms?
00:33:56.952,00:33:59.913,And Nurse Ocampo gets the door prize.
00:33:59.955,00:34:06.920,And now we will take just a little piece of our friend here -- a nice sample to test.
00:34:06.962,00:34:08.588,"Thank you, Doctor."
00:34:08.630,00:34:09.756,And now the rest.
00:34:14.636,00:34:18.056,Aut libertatem aut mortem mihi da.
00:34:18.097,00:34:19.516,"Shaun, do you know that means?"
00:34:19.558,00:34:23.186,No. It's not relevant to this surgery.
00:34:23.228,00:34:25.438,"Oh, it's relevant."
00:34:25.480,00:34:26.565,"No, it's not."
00:34:26.606,00:34:31.277,Heart rate and ETCO2 are rising.
00:34:31.319,00:34:33.112,Slight change in body temperature.
00:34:33.154,00:34:34.280,His heart rate's 108.
00:34:34.322,00:34:35.866,Check tube placement and suction him.
00:34:35.908,00:34:38.243,"If he takes a turn, we might have to abort."
00:34:38.284,00:34:40.370,I don't think so.
00:34:40.412,00:34:41.413,Keep him stable.
00:34:41.454,00:34:42.789,He's tachy.
00:34:42.831,00:34:46.459,"115, 117, 120, and rising."
00:34:46.501,00:34:49.629,He is going into v-tach.
00:34:49.671,00:34:50.964,Robert Ato is dying.
00:34:56.386,00:34:58.805,I'm gonna pull out of the pons slowly.
00:34:58.847,00:35:00.682,"You pull out now, you might damage the cerebellar peduncle."
00:35:00.724,00:35:03.518,"If I don't get out now, I'll kill him if he starts seizing."
00:35:03.560,00:35:05.854,Something's not right.
00:35:05.896,00:35:07.856,Bradycardia would make more sense.
00:35:10.067,00:35:11.902,Ideas.
00:35:15.113,00:35:20.869,"Tachycardia, rising body temperature again, muscle rigidity, CO2 is rising."
00:35:20.911,00:35:22.412,Muscle rigidity?
00:35:22.454,00:35:23.663,It's all over.
00:35:25.040,00:35:26.875,We'd only have muscle rigidity on one side.
00:35:26.917,00:35:31.922,Think.
00:35:31.964,00:35:33.506,CO2...
00:35:33.548,00:35:34.674,It's the anesthesia.
00:35:34.716,00:35:36.676,Malignant hyperthermia.
00:35:36.718,00:35:38.177,"140 dantrolene, STAT."
00:35:38.219,00:35:40.055,"Kalu, Murphy, get as many cooling blankets as you can."
00:35:40.097,00:35:41.180,We need to get this temperature down.
00:35:41.222,00:35:42.181,-Coming out.
00:35:42.223,00:35:45.477,"Hyperventilate at 100% O2, 10 liters per minute."
00:35:45.518,00:35:47.771,"Flush out the old anesthetic, lower the ETCO2."
00:35:47.813,00:35:49.940,I want vecuronium on deck.
00:35:49.982,00:35:50.941,Let's move!
00:35:56.738,00:35:58.115,And we're on.
00:36:00.450,00:36:01.743,Wait.
00:36:08.458,00:36:10.043,CO2 is coming down.
00:36:10.085,00:36:11.878,"Heart rate is coming down, too."
00:36:11.920,00:36:14.339,Temperature is 101.
00:36:14.380,00:36:16.508,Okay.
00:36:16.549,00:36:19.385,Thank you very much.
00:36:19.427,00:36:21.387,Terry Fox.
00:36:21.429,00:36:24.641,Or my personal favorite -- Jim Abbott.
00:36:34.943,00:36:36.569,Come in.
00:36:38.989,00:36:40.949,Hi.
00:36:40.991,00:36:45.120,I need to talk to you about Dr. Coyle.
00:36:48.289,00:36:50.917,Dr. Browne.
00:36:50.959,00:36:53.962,I wanted to talk to you about the same thing.
00:36:54.004,00:36:55.588,Please.
00:37:05.682,00:37:09.602,The surgery was a success.
00:37:09.644,00:37:13.272,And the outcome might be better than expected.
00:37:13.314,00:37:18.862,"There will still be significant neurological dysfunction on your left side, but not as much as we'd anticipated."
00:37:22.532,00:37:25.368,Thank you.
00:37:25.410,00:37:27.328,"You did good, my friend."
00:37:37.714,00:37:40.717,You have to be patient.
00:37:40.759,00:37:43.595,Nah.
00:37:43.636,00:37:47.849,Is patience a bad thing?
00:37:47.891,00:37:54.689,Acceptance is a bad thing.
00:37:56.733,00:38:03.656,"When I was a kid, I -- I wasn't good at jack."
00:38:03.698,00:38:08.161,But I never quit.
00:38:08.203,00:38:12.665,I...
00:38:12.707,00:38:15.460,found my thing.
00:38:17.420,00:38:27.722,Don't ever let anyone tell you what you can and can't...
00:38:27.764,00:38:29.348,do.
00:38:55.834,00:38:59.629,I'm sorry.
00:38:59.671,00:39:02.215,It was a rough day.
00:39:02.257,00:39:05.218,Probably had a few too...
00:39:16.771,00:39:21.901,"I'll call your dad, and -- I don't want to have kids."
00:39:37.500,00:39:40.337,"Shaun, I'm gonna drive you home."
00:39:40.378,00:39:41.880,You're gonna see Melissa.
00:39:41.921,00:39:44.007,"If you don't like her, she'll leave."
00:39:44.049,00:39:47.177,But there's no more running away.
00:39:47.219,00:39:50.013,Why do you think I'm doing this?
00:39:50.055,00:39:52.724,Because you are stubborn.
00:39:52.765,00:39:55.434,"Ok-Okay, yeah, okay, sure."
00:39:55.476,00:39:57.937,"But I'm doing this for you, okay?"
00:39:57.979,00:40:02.359,"So that you can have a better life, so that you can have a happier life."
00:40:02.400,00:40:05.778,What if it doesn't make me happy?
00:40:05.820,00:40:07.655,What if it doesn't make me happy?
00:40:07.697,00:40:11.576,What if it only makes you happy?
00:40:11.617,00:40:14.371,You think -- You think I'm doing this to make me happy?
00:40:14.412,00:40:16.164,"I'm not happy, Shaun."
00:40:16.206,00:40:19.084,"I'm not close to being happy, and you know what?"
00:40:19.125,00:40:23.671,"I am done explaining, I am done bribing, and I am done talking."
00:40:23.713,00:40:24.797,Now let's go.
00:40:24.839,00:40:26.465,No! Let's go!
00:40:27.884,00:40:31.388,"No, I -- I want to make my own decisions."
00:40:31.429,00:40:33.098,"I -- Shaun, can you keep your voice down, please? Please?"
00:40:33.139,00:40:36.268,"You -- You cannot keep ordering me around, okay?"
00:40:36.309,00:40:38.019,You're not my father!
00:40:39.771,00:40:41.439,I know that.
00:40:41.480,00:40:43.942,"Shaun, I don't understand..."
00:40:43.983,00:40:46.111,Okay.
00:40:46.152,00:40:48.321,You don't let anyone -- I don't get it.
00:40:48.363,00:40:52.867,anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do.
00:40:52.909,00:40:55.828,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:40:55.870,00:40:58.664,"Hey, just calm -- Shaun. Hey, hey, Shaun."
00:40:58.706,00:41:00.417,"Okay, okay, okay."
00:41:00.458,00:41:02.419,I'm just trying to help.
00:41:00.458,00:41:03.586,I want make my own -- Shaun!
00:41:05.213,00:41:19.727,I -- What were you thinking?!
00:41:19.769,00:41:24.565,"I do not need you to fight my battles, and I certainly never asked you to."
00:41:24.607,00:41:29.654,"And if you really respected me, you would not treat me like some damsel who needed protection, okay?"
00:41:29.695,00:41:33.574,You would treat me with the respect that you would automatically give to a man.
00:41:33.616,00:41:37.703,You'd treat me like a person capable of handling her own life!
00:41:37.745,00:41:40.539,And maybe -- maybe it's too much to ask of you.
00:41:40.581,00:41:44.502,Apparently Andrews agrees with you.
00:41:44.543,00:41:47.546,I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.
00:41:53.552,00:41:56.764,Shaun? Shaun!
00:41:56.806,00:41:58.224,Where would he go?
00:41:58.266,00:42:01.060,"Is there a place he likes to hang out, a place where he feels comfortable?"
00:42:01.102,00:42:02.728,"No, I don't know."
00:42:02.770,00:42:05.190,"I mean, he's not at the hospital."
00:42:05.231,00:42:10.111,And there used to be a picture here of Shaun...
00:42:10.153,00:42:12.613,"and his brother, Steve."
00:42:14.282,00:42:15.908,What do you think that means?
00:42:22.081,00:42:24.334,It means he's not coming back.
00:00:01.293,00:00:02.837,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:02.878,00:00:05.631,Dr. Coyle -- He's a little too friendly.
00:00:05.673,00:00:06.715,I'm sure he's just trying to establish a rapport.
00:00:08.300,00:00:09.677,And I'll make a killer omelet in the morning.
00:00:09.718,00:00:11.010,That's really inappropriate.
00:00:11.052,00:00:12.596,I said no.
00:00:12.638,00:00:13.764,You're approaching insubordination.
00:00:13.806,00:00:15.641,Jared: You have to file a complaint with HR.
00:00:15.683,00:00:18.686,They will shift the blame onto me. Like you did.
00:00:19.937,00:00:22.272,I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.
00:00:22.314,00:00:23.816,"So, why do I need to quit my job to have a family?"
00:00:23.858,00:00:26.109,Agreed. She can be a great lawyer and a great mom.
00:00:26.151,00:00:27.402,I don't want to have kids.
00:00:27.444,00:00:29.404,Shaun: I don't need a therapist.
00:00:29.446,00:00:31.323,I want to make my own decisions.
00:00:31.365,00:00:32.324,I am done talking.
00:00:32.366,00:00:33.492,Now let's go.
00:00:33.534,00:00:34.535,I don't want help!
00:00:34.576,00:00:35.661,Melissa: Where would he go?
00:00:35.703,00:00:36.954,Is there a place he likes to hang out?
00:00:38.246,00:00:39.623,And there used to be a picture here.
00:00:39.665,00:00:41.709,It means he's not coming back.
00:00:44.962,00:00:46.463,Hi. Good morning.
00:00:48.215,00:00:49.591,I work with Shaun.
00:00:49.633,00:00:51.426,Hi. Nice to meet you.
00:00:51.468,00:00:53.721,"It's nice to meet you, too."
00:00:53.762,00:00:56.473,"Uh, Shaun isn't here."
00:00:56.515,00:01:03.898,"I know you've been helping Shaun, and I appreciate that, but I really need to speak with him immediately."
00:01:03.939,00:01:07.192,I'll definitely let him know when I see him next.
00:01:08.068,00:01:09.319,I'm -- I'm sorry.
00:01:09.361,00:01:10.404,What the hell are you doing?
00:01:10.445,00:01:11.739,"Shaun, I know you're in here."
00:01:11.780,00:01:14.282,"I just -- I just want to talk, please."
00:01:14.324,00:01:15.617,You are way out of line.
00:01:18.078,00:01:19.454,We've got to sort this out.
00:01:19.496,00:01:21.206,You have five seconds to get the hell out of here...
00:01:21.248,00:01:22.499,-Shaun.
00:01:22.541,00:01:26.461,"-Shaun, I just -- -What are -- I just want to..."
00:01:26.503,00:01:29.297,-Five...
00:01:29.339,00:01:30.925,"Shaun, she's calling the police."
00:01:30.966,00:01:32.384,-...four...
00:01:32.426,00:01:34.135,Lea: ...three...
00:01:34.177,00:01:35.387,...two...
00:01:35.429,00:01:36.972,-...one.
00:01:37.014,00:01:41.393,It's just that Shaun has a-a tendency to run away from conflict.
00:01:41.435,00:01:52.112,"And in Casper and medical school, people will give you a little bit of slack, but it -- now he's in a very hard-to-get job in a very competitive environment where people do not give you a second chance."
00:01:52.153,00:01:56.700,"Still, not cool."
00:02:00.328,00:02:04.458,"If you speak with him will you call me, please?"
00:02:04.499,00:02:06.627,Out.
00:02:08.629,00:02:10.505,Yeah.
00:02:21.391,00:02:24.144,"So, what's your plan now?"
00:02:26.521,00:02:29.316,I don't know.
00:02:29.357,00:02:42.245,"-- Captions by VITAC -- I gotta say, he seems like a nebby, old jerk."
00:02:42.287,00:02:43.246,And a bully.
00:02:43.288,00:02:44.790,What's nebby?
00:02:44.832,00:02:47.208,Nosey.
00:02:47.250,00:02:48.794,"I mean, you're a grown man."
00:02:48.836,00:02:51.130,"If you don't want to talk to him, it's none of his business."
00:02:51.170,00:02:55.216,San Jose is too big.
00:02:55.258,00:02:57.719,I get not liking San Jose.
00:03:01.890,00:03:03.600,So don't.
00:03:05.894,00:03:08.563,I should go back to Casper.
00:03:08.605,00:03:10.189,I have a rule.
00:03:17.364,00:03:21.284,"Okay, you are overworked, stressed out, and pissed off at your boss."
00:03:24.163,00:03:27.541,"You need to take a break, clear your head."
00:03:27.582,00:03:29.084,You need a vacation.
00:03:29.126,00:03:32.838,I have to work five more months before I earn a vacation.
00:03:35.007,00:03:36.758,I'm not sick.
00:03:36.800,00:03:38.969,You're so adorable.
00:03:41.805,00:03:44.349,"Ah, I have so much to teach you, Grasshopper."
00:03:44.391,00:03:47.519,"And I'm gonna start with a good, old-fashioned road trip."
00:03:49.312,00:03:55.402,"And when we return, you're gonna know exactly what to do about San Jose, therapy, and Glassy the Grouch."
00:03:55.443,00:04:06.163,And all you have to do to attain this superior wisdom and knowledge is to call...in...sick.
00:04:10.167,00:04:12.669,Okay. Okay. I will.
00:04:15.839,00:04:18.299,Dr. Melendez.
00:04:18.341,00:04:19.676,My schedule's pretty packed today.
00:04:19.718,00:04:22.596,It's a patient of mine.
00:04:27.017,00:04:28.351,Why is she a patient of yours?
00:04:28.393,00:04:33.065,I put balloon tissue expanders under both girls' scalps to prepare them for the separation surgery.
00:04:33.107,00:04:34.482,Separation surgery?
00:04:39.487,00:04:42.908,"It's in six months, after they recover from the transplant."
00:04:42.950,00:04:44.284,"Of course, if you're too busy..."
00:04:44.325,00:04:46.661,No. I'm in.
00:04:49.164,00:04:51.792,Where's Murphy?
00:04:51.833,00:04:54.502,Wrong day to be late.
00:04:55.378,00:04:57.965,"Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that."
00:05:04.888,00:05:07.099,Andrews is waiting to brief us on a new case.
00:05:07.141,00:05:10.351,It's a kidney transplant on craniopagus twins.
00:05:10.393,00:05:12.062,Conjoined?
00:05:12.104,00:05:13.521,They're connected at the skull.
00:05:13.563,00:05:16.524,Their entire renal-vascular systems are interdependent.
00:05:16.900,00:05:18.110,Cool.
00:05:18.152,00:05:20.487,Hey. Have either of you talked to Shaun?
00:05:20.528,00:05:23.657,-No.
00:05:23.698,00:05:24.908,Is anything wrong?
00:05:24.950,00:05:28.203,"No, no, not with Shaun."
00:05:28.245,00:05:30.622,He's gonna be out for a few days.
00:05:28.245,00:05:32.833,He's supposed to get approval for any personal days from his attending.
00:05:32.874,00:05:34.334,"Right, which is why I'm checking in."
00:05:34.375,00:05:37.796,I think he thought it was enough just to notify me.
00:05:49.891,00:05:50.976,You call in sick?
00:05:57.482,00:05:59.358,"No, you're not."
00:06:04.156,00:06:06.867,You're gonna need more than a family photo and a toothbrush.
00:06:06.908,00:06:07.909,Go pack.
00:06:07.951,00:06:09.119,"Uh, where are we going?"
00:06:09.161,00:06:10.578,Wherever the car takes us.
00:06:10.620,00:06:11.663,I don't like the beach.
00:06:11.705,00:06:14.124,"Okay, I will let the car know."
00:06:15.416,00:06:23.884,"Even with your cardiovascular issues, a kidney transplant is a relatively safe procedure, especially since, with identical twins, there's no chance for organ rejection."
00:06:23.925,00:06:25.927,Just make sure you keep straight which one's which.
00:06:25.969,00:06:29.597,"The charming, pretty one has the good kidneys."
00:06:29.639,00:06:32.351,Don't worry.
00:06:32.391,00:06:34.728,And we put everything in writing.
00:06:36.563,00:06:38.357,-Mm-hmm.
00:06:38.397,00:06:40.108,Glenda: And smart.
00:06:40.150,00:06:41.568,They're gonna be Ivy Leaguers in the fall.
00:06:43.904,00:06:48.200,"Mom, you don't have to tell everyone you meet where we're going to college."
00:06:50.660,00:06:53.496,"So, who's going where?"
00:06:53.538,00:06:55.623,What do you think?
00:06:53.538,00:06:57.251,She's totally obnoxious and thinks she's way funnier than she is.
00:06:57.292,00:07:00.254,-Definitely Harvard.
00:07:00.295,00:07:02.505,"Hey, don't make me start mocking your tattoo."
00:07:07.594,00:07:10.764,I thought you would have your entire apartment strapped to your back.
00:07:10.805,00:07:13.641,It takes me a long time to pack.
00:07:13.683,00:07:17.604,An anal-retentive packer is the exact type of person I'd want operating on me.
00:07:17.645,00:07:19.981,"Lea, this -- this is your car."
00:07:20.023,00:07:22.109,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:22.150,00:07:25.946,Okay.
00:07:31.576,00:07:35.663,I just want to know how you can afford two cars.
00:07:35.705,00:07:37.749,Hmm.
00:07:37.791,00:07:39.084,"Yeah, I can't."
00:07:39.126,00:07:45.006,"Uh, my Grandpa Rod died last year, and he left me his most prized possession."
00:07:47.092,00:07:50.929,It's the S-Striped Tomato.
00:07:50.971,00:07:52.389,"Oh, my God."
00:07:52.431,00:07:54.057,It's okay.
00:07:54.099,00:07:57.269,A meticulous packer and a Starsky &amp; Hutch fan.
00:07:57.311,00:07:58.728,Grandpa Rod would have loved you.
00:08:06.194,00:08:09.990,Okay. This is it.
00:08:10.031,00:08:11.658,You sure you want to do this?
00:08:11.699,00:08:15.287,Speak now or forever hold your peace.
00:08:15.870,00:08:17.789,I'm sure.
00:08:18.957,00:08:20.708,"Let's go, Lea."
00:08:21.793,00:08:23.003,Here we go!
00:08:33.305,00:08:38.310,I hear Murphy's AWOL.
00:08:38.352,00:08:40.603,He's taking a few personal days.
00:08:40.645,00:08:41.938,Unapproved personal days.
00:08:41.980,00:08:43.106,I approved them.
00:08:43.148,00:08:44.607,It's not your job to approve them.
00:08:44.649,00:08:50.571,Or to say you approved them to cover up the fact that Murphy's frequent tardiness has escalated to absences.
00:08:50.613,00:08:54.117,"What do you want me to do, take a polygraph?"
00:08:54.159,00:08:56.244,How about we jump into enhanced interrogation?
00:08:56.286,00:08:59.706,"Here, how about this?"
00:08:59.747,00:09:08.715,"When the board was reconsidering your hiring of Murphy, you assured us that if he was anything less than excellent, he'd be dismissed and you would resign."
00:09:08.756,00:09:10.258,I trust you remember that.
00:09:10.300,00:09:13.345,I wouldn't have your movers pack up your office just yet.
00:09:13.387,00:09:15.347,You can't protect Murphy forever.
00:09:15.389,00:09:20.519,"At some point, he needs to succeed or fail on his own."
00:09:24.398,00:09:29.403,"J.L.: Okay, that's three hours on the warm ischemia clock of the transplanted kidney."
00:09:29.444,00:09:32.489,Melendez: The ureter is attached to the bladder.
00:09:32.531,00:09:36.368,How's the kidney's placement in the iliac fossa?
00:09:37.327,00:09:39.454,No kinking or twisting of the renal vessel.
00:09:39.496,00:09:41.664,Good.
00:09:42.623,00:09:44.792,You ready to close?
00:09:45.793,00:09:47.754,Yes.
00:09:48.671,00:09:52.300,Your best bet is a continuous suture along the fascial layer.
00:09:52.342,00:09:54.802,Suture.
00:09:57.431,00:09:59.558,Donor's pressure's dropping.
00:09:59.599,00:10:00.850,"Okay, up the oxygen."
00:10:00.892,00:10:02.269,Jenny must be bleeding internally.
00:10:02.310,00:10:03.478,We're gonna have to open her back up.
00:10:03.520,00:10:05.146,Staple remover.
00:10:12.237,00:10:14.822,I like trees.
00:10:14.864,00:10:16.824,Yeah?
00:10:16.866,00:10:21.580,Besides reading medical journals and watching reruns of old cop shows?
00:10:21.621,00:10:23.748,-I like you.
00:10:23.790,00:10:26.126,"Well, who wouldn't?"
00:10:26.167,00:10:28.795,Why don't you like San Jose?
00:10:28.836,00:10:31.256,Everyone's so competitive here.
00:10:31.298,00:10:35.218,"You know, if you didn't make a million by 30, you're a total loser."
00:10:35.260,00:10:37.596,I don't need $1 million.
00:10:37.637,00:10:40.681,"I don't even think I need $90,000, but..."
00:10:40.723,00:10:42.976,You know what we both need are some tunes.
00:10:43.017,00:10:44.478,What's your preferred driving music?
00:10:44.519,00:10:47.688,M-Music -- No. N-- I don't like music. No. No.
00:10:47.730,00:10:50.984,"What? No, no."
00:10:51.025,00:10:59.742,"Okay, I will give you a pass on not liking the beach because you're cute and I might need you to do brain surgery on me someday, but not liking music -- unacceptable."
00:10:59.784,00:11:00.743,I won't have it.
00:11:00.785,00:11:02.662,Are you being sarcastic?
00:11:05.373,00:11:08.126,"I actually don't know the word for it, but my point stands."
00:11:08.168,00:11:10.128,Music is amazing.
00:11:10.170,00:11:17.427,"You know, I remember every important thing that has ever happened to me based on what song I was listening to at the time."
00:11:17.469,00:11:19.971,I remember smells.
00:11:20.013,00:11:27.103,"Like our parking garage smells like fabric softener, and when my brother died, it smelled like burnt food."
00:11:27.728,00:11:31.774,"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry."
00:11:31.816,00:11:36.946,"How did he, um..."
00:11:37.364,00:11:40.241,My father was mean.
00:11:40.283,00:11:44.871,"He killed my pet, so my brother and I, we ran away."
00:11:44.912,00:11:48.916,"Then he fell off a train we were playing on, hit his head, and died."
00:11:50.709,00:11:54.631,I never went back home.
00:11:54.673,00:11:59.052,Dr. Glassman has watched out for me ever since.
00:11:59.969,00:12:06.100,"Okay, so, maybe he's not that much of a nebby jerk."
00:12:08.061,00:12:11.439,What are you smelling right now?
00:12:12.440,00:12:15.026,Pine trees.
00:12:16.194,00:12:18.779,Mm.
00:12:16.194,00:12:22.950,"I'm never gonna forget that when you told me about your brother and your dad, it smelled like pine trees."
00:12:22.992,00:12:27.997,"But I don't want you to ever forget that right after you told me, we were listening to..."
00:12:29.374,00:12:31.626,Ouch. No.
00:12:31.668,00:12:33.294,Or that.
00:12:33.336,00:12:34.962,"No, thank you."
00:12:35.004,00:12:37.173,Nope. Not feeling it.
00:12:37.215,00:12:41.010,"Ooh, so good."
00:12:41.052,00:12:44.805,This is the one you will not forget.
00:12:44.847,00:12:46.266,Do not forget this.
00:13:06.911,00:13:09.038,Jenny had a post-op renal-vein rupture.
00:13:09.080,00:13:11.666,We were able to repair it before she lost too much blood.
00:13:11.708,00:13:14.919,"Both your vitals are stable now, and Katie's new kidney is functioning well."
00:13:14.961,00:13:16.671,Thank God.
00:13:16.713,00:13:19.674,Will her ruptured vein have any effect on our separation surgery?
00:13:19.716,00:13:20.841,It better not.
00:13:20.883,00:13:29.142,"Katie, I love you, but if I have to spend one minute more than I have to watching you practicing some Mozart song -- They're not songs."
00:13:29.183,00:13:32.270,Don't worry.
00:13:45.659,00:13:52.123,"Look, what I did was incredibly unprofessional and just...inexcusable."
00:13:52.165,00:13:55.209,But I'm guessing you're gonna give one anyway.
00:13:55.251,00:13:56.877,No.
00:13:56.919,00:14:01.299,"No, just an explanation and a, uh...request."
00:14:02.509,00:14:05.428,It could help me to convince Andrews I deserve a second chance.
00:14:05.470,00:14:09.683,Okay.
00:14:10.016,00:14:13.269,Dr. Browne and I are...
00:14:13.311,00:14:16.022,"Look, if you could just put yourself in my shoes."
00:14:16.063,00:14:25.281,"A woman I care about tells me a guy harassed her, and, even worse, she tells me it's my fault because I was too -- too stupidly insensitive to understand what she was going through."
00:14:25.323,00:14:28.785,I felt like crap.
00:14:28.827,00:14:34.081,"And like an idiot, I...tried to make it up to her."
00:14:37.001,00:14:40.505,All I'm asking for is just a little understanding.
00:14:41.214,00:14:42.423,Wouldn't you have done the same thing?
00:14:48.054,00:14:50.139,Not my problem.
00:14:53.476,00:14:54.519,Claire: Yeah?
00:14:54.561,00:14:56.479,Jenny's bradycardic and hypotensive.
00:14:56.521,00:14:58.356,-What's happening?
00:14:58.398,00:15:00.525,"We were talking, then she started to have trouble breathing."
00:15:04.779,00:15:06.489,Jenny's heart is failing.
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.200,No pulse.
00:15:09.242,00:15:10.744,She's in V-tach.
00:15:21.629,00:15:22.630,Jenny's stable.
00:15:26.467,00:15:29.554,Renal-vein rupture must have caused her already weak heart to deteriorate.
00:15:29.596,00:15:32.139,She's in end-stage failure.
00:15:35.017,00:15:37.687,We're not gonna find a donor heart in a few days.
00:15:40.398,00:15:46.905,We could disconnect her from the other body her heart is partially oxygenating the blood for.
00:15:52.702,00:15:55.246,Do you really think they could handle it one day after?
00:15:56.080,00:15:58.958,It may be our only choice.
00:16:01.502,00:16:02.462,Yeah.
00:16:06.507,00:16:11.095,His calls are an even bigger buzzkill than this rain and defeating the whole purpose of this trip.
00:16:12.806,00:16:17.894,Residents are not supposed to turn off their phones.
00:16:17.936,00:16:19.395,How about we make a deal?
00:16:19.437,00:16:23.316,"If you turn off your phone, I'll let you drive."
00:16:23.357,00:16:26.820,I don't have a driver's license.
00:16:26.861,00:16:29.864,I've always wanted to learn to drive.
00:16:29.906,00:16:33.075,Dr. Glassman -- he never wanted me to.
00:16:33.117,00:16:37.163,"Actually, I didn't know that, but that definitely sounds like Glassy."
00:16:39.206,00:16:40.124,Okay.
00:16:48.090,00:16:49.509,You're doing awesome.
00:16:49.550,00:16:52.219,You're a natural.
00:16:52.261,00:16:53.638,Thank you.
00:16:57.057,00:16:59.226,Blinker.
00:16:59.268,00:17:03.356,"All right, now make this left turn."
00:17:03.397,00:17:04.899,"Okay, don't circle this time."
00:17:10.279,00:17:12.740,What are you stopping for?
00:17:12.782,00:17:15.493,You want me to go out on the street?
00:17:15.994,00:17:19.497,It's where the car wants to go.
00:17:21.290,00:17:24.084,What's the worst thing that could happen?
00:17:31.300,00:17:32.677,And I'll be right here with you.
00:17:32.719,00:17:34.762,Mm-hmm.
00:17:39.767,00:17:42.937,"Half Dome, here we come."
00:17:42.979,00:17:44.104,Can I turn on the radio?
00:17:44.146,00:17:46.649,"-No! No, thank you."
00:18:04.333,00:18:12.675,"We believe moving up the separation surgery will lighten the load on Jenny's heart, maybe allow it to recover a bit so a transplant won't even be necessary in the future."
00:18:12.717,00:18:17.096,"It is higher risk for Katie now, given that her new kidney is still not fully functional."
00:18:17.137,00:18:19.682,What do you think we should do?
00:18:19.724,00:18:22.101,It's your bodies.
00:18:24.311,00:18:28.315,"I raised you both to be strong and independent, and you are."
00:18:28.357,00:18:32.904,"So whatever you decide, I'll support."
00:18:35.364,00:18:37.533,Let's do it.
00:18:37.575,00:18:39.994,Go ahead.
00:18:42.038,00:18:43.581,We obviously need both your consent.
00:18:43.623,00:18:45.917,-Okay.
00:18:45.959,00:18:47.961,You want to talk more?
00:18:48.002,00:18:51.464,No. I'm good.
00:18:55.134,00:18:56.719,Shaun: I want a car.
00:18:56.761,00:18:58.012,So get one.
00:18:58.054,00:19:01.724,"You've been driving a half-hour, and you're already better than half the people in San Jose."
00:19:01.766,00:19:04.644,I get distracted when I'm alone.
00:19:04.685,00:19:06.813,That's why I miss my bus sometimes.
00:19:06.854,00:19:10.357,Dr. Glassman thinks I'd do the same thing driving.
00:19:10.399,00:19:12.610,He's probably right.
00:19:14.695,00:19:16.072,Want to have some fun?
00:19:16.114,00:19:18.825,-I'm already having fun.
00:19:18.866,00:19:20.367,-Why?
00:19:23.287,00:19:24.622,Thank you.
00:19:28.084,00:19:30.128,Put your left foot on the brake.
00:19:30.169,00:19:31.963,"Mm, okay."
00:19:32.005,00:19:33.380,There we go.
00:19:33.422,00:19:36.300,Now hold it all the way down.
00:19:36.342,00:19:40.096,"Okay, now floor the gas with your right foot."
00:19:42.473,00:19:44.851,I-I don't know about this.
00:19:46.268,00:19:49.981,Now slowly ease your left foot off the brake...
00:19:51.107,00:19:52.984,...until you hear...
00:19:53.026,00:19:54.735,...this.
00:19:54.777,00:19:56.654,I smell smoke.
00:19:56.696,00:19:58.405,"Yeah, that's the point, Shaun."
00:19:58.447,00:20:01.325,It's burning rubber.
00:20:02.994,00:20:04.162,-Okay.
00:20:10.543,00:20:12.086,"Now, this is fun."
00:20:14.254,00:20:15.464,"Okay, that's enough."
00:20:15.506,00:20:17.550,We need some rubber left to get us home.
00:20:17.591,00:20:20.094,I am burning rubber.
00:20:20.136,00:20:21.888,"Okay, Shaun, it's time to stop."
00:20:23.806,00:20:25.850,"Shaun, take your other foot off the gas!"
00:20:25.892,00:20:27.643,"Shaun, look out!"
00:20:28.561,00:20:30.688,It's the other foot!
00:20:30.730,00:20:31.898,It's the other foot!
00:20:31.939,00:20:33.440,It's the other foot!
00:20:35.985,00:20:39.947,Dr. Ko and I have been working for months to map the structure of Jenny and Katie's brain.
00:20:39.989,00:20:41.657,-Don't you mean brains?
00:20:39.989,00:20:45.536,"-Actually, while different regions operate independently for each sister, there is a single brain mass."
00:20:45.578,00:20:49.248,That's why all their previous neurosurgeons insisted separation was impossible.
00:20:49.289,00:20:53.920,The real problem won't be dividing their brains but dividing their veins.
00:20:53.961,00:20:56.881,They share a single sagittal sinus vein.
00:20:56.923,00:20:58.465,Melendez: Which we'll give to Jenny.
00:20:58.507,00:21:02.302,Then we'll create a new one for Katie using a grafted vein from her leg.
00:21:04.889,00:21:08.475,"Well, with 6 months of prep to do in 12 hours, it was their only choice."
00:21:10.310,00:21:11.395,-I crashed.
00:21:11.437,00:21:12.646,"We just -- -Yes, I-I crashed."
00:21:12.688,00:21:14.314,I hit something.
00:21:14.356,00:21:16.150,I hit something.
00:21:17.484,00:21:18.903,-I felt it. I crashed.
00:21:18.945,00:21:20.113,-Yes.
00:21:20.154,00:21:21.321,-No.
00:21:21.363,00:21:22.615,"No, you're wrong."
00:21:23.699,00:21:24.575,I crashed.
00:21:24.617,00:21:25.618,-I crashed.
00:21:25.659,00:21:27.828,-Okay. Okay.
00:21:27.870,00:21:29.371,Breathe.
00:21:29.413,00:21:32.374,"Whatever happened, whatever you felt, you did nothing wrong."
00:21:32.416,00:21:35.128,"It was all my fault, okay?"
00:21:38.131,00:21:41.592,Okay. Dr. Glassman -- He was right.
00:21:41.634,00:21:44.971,I-I should not be allowed to drive.
00:21:45.012,00:21:47.014,"No, no."
00:21:51.310,00:21:52.352,Shaun.
00:21:52.394,00:21:55.231,"No, I'm not going to drive, thank you."
00:21:55.273,00:21:58.067,"Yeah, I -- I know."
00:21:58.109,00:22:00.611,'Cause you were right.
00:22:16.210,00:22:17.711,Everything is still looking good.
00:22:17.753,00:22:21.257,"If you need anything during the night, just press your call button."
00:22:21.299,00:22:24.010,Is Jenny asleep?
00:22:24.051,00:22:25.052,Yeah.
00:22:25.094,00:22:26.428,Where's Dr. Andrews?
00:22:26.470,00:22:30.099,He is with Dr. Ko and Dr. Melendez.
00:22:30.141,00:22:32.977,They're working to finalize the surgical protocol for tomorrow.
00:22:33.019,00:22:35.437,I need to talk to him.
00:22:35.479,00:22:37.731,Is there anything I can do?
00:22:40.276,00:22:41.694,I changed my mind.
00:22:41.735,00:22:45.405,I don't want to do the separation surgery.
00:22:47.074,00:22:48.784,I'll go find him right away.
00:22:57.626,00:23:01.588,"I understand she's scared, but without this surgery, there is a good chance both of them die."
00:23:01.630,00:23:03.090,Have you talked to the mother?
00:23:03.132,00:23:05.425,"She refuses to weigh in, insists it's their decision."
00:23:05.467,00:23:07.011,Let me try and talk to her.
00:23:07.053,00:23:08.386,I don't think that's a good idea.
00:23:12.975,00:23:15.186,So she's not even close to objective.
00:23:15.228,00:23:17.771,"Okay, now is not the time to be worrying about lawsuits."
00:23:17.813,00:23:18.939,That's my job.
00:23:18.981,00:23:20.816,And our job is saving these girls' lives.
00:23:20.858,00:23:24.778,"Okay, take it easy."
00:23:27.531,00:23:28.824,I will try again.
00:23:31.618,00:23:32.995,Browne should do it.
00:23:35.289,00:23:39.210,We need someone that an 18-year-old girl trusts.
00:23:39.252,00:23:41.295,She's also the best communicator out of all of us.
00:23:46.884,00:23:49.595,Okay.
00:23:49.636,00:23:50.930,We'll give Katie the night to think it over.
00:23:50.971,00:23:52.223,"Browne, you'll talk to her in the morning."
00:23:52.265,00:23:53.557,Get her to consent to this surgery.
00:23:53.599,00:23:56.394,And if I'm not able to do that?
00:23:59.355,00:24:03.067,It's not a big deal.
00:24:03.109,00:24:05.986,That's why God makes mechanics -- and booze.
00:24:06.028,00:24:07.738,"Two shots of tequila, please."
00:24:07.780,00:24:09.823,I'm not thirsty.
00:24:09.865,00:24:13.244,You don't drink tequila because you're thirsty.
00:24:14.036,00:24:16.372,Have you ever been drunk?
00:24:17.539,00:24:18.874,Never?
00:24:18.916,00:24:23.129,Eight years of college a-and not one frat party?
00:24:23.170,00:24:25.965,Tailgating?
00:24:26.006,00:24:27.216,What is your job?
00:24:27.258,00:24:29.718,Now you're interested in my job?
00:24:29.760,00:24:30.970,Yes.
00:24:31.011,00:24:33.139,I'm an automotive engineer.
00:24:33.180,00:24:37.643,I work for a start-up that's developing new designs for self-driving cars.
00:24:37.684,00:24:39.353,Do you like it?
00:24:39.395,00:24:41.355,No.
00:24:41.397,00:24:42.731,Oh.
00:24:42.773,00:24:48.528,"I like to build things, not to sit in endless meetings talking about building things."
00:24:48.570,00:24:50.823,Thank you.
00:24:50.864,00:24:52.366,Perfect timing.
00:24:52.408,00:24:56.454,We are supposed to be forgetting about work.
00:24:58.872,00:25:03.336,For living happy because you're a long time dead.
00:25:16.056,00:25:18.392,It's...good.
00:25:18.434,00:25:24.273,"Oh, my God. You have to be the first person in history to actually like their first tequila shot."
00:25:24.315,00:25:26.233,-Do you want another?
00:25:26.275,00:25:29.236,-Yes.
00:25:29.278,00:25:30.570,Yes!
00:25:41.415,00:25:42.708,What?
00:25:44.710,00:25:46.462,Sorry.
00:25:46.504,00:25:48.381,We should break this off.
00:25:48.422,00:25:50.341,There's only so much studying you can do.
00:25:57.806,00:25:59.433,Do you want kids?
00:26:00.351,00:26:03.396,Sorry.
00:26:05.314,00:26:07.816,it's just not a question I was expecting.
00:26:07.858,00:26:10.986,Jessica just told me she doesn't. Ever.
00:26:11.028,00:26:11.945,Wow.
00:26:11.987,00:26:13.571,It doesn't make any sense.
00:26:13.613,00:26:16.700,She would be such an amazing mother.
00:26:16.742,00:26:20.413,I guess she's lucky she realized before it's too late.
00:26:20.454,00:26:23.707,Some women don't.
00:26:23.749,00:26:25.834,My mom was definitely one of those.
00:26:25.876,00:26:28.754,"-Sorry. I didn't mean to -- -No, it's okay."
00:26:28.795,00:26:33.675,Water under the bridge...
00:26:33.717,00:26:35.635,It was a long time ago.
00:26:36.594,00:26:38.097,I don't know what to do.
00:26:39.515,00:26:47.147,"I can't imagine my life without her, but I also can't imagine a life without..."
00:26:49.275,00:26:51.235,I'm sorry.
00:26:51.277,00:26:53.404,this is not your problem.
00:26:53.446,00:26:55.989,-It's okay.
00:27:02.704,00:27:08.626,"Finding someone you can't imagine a life without, it's hard."
00:27:08.668,00:27:13.215,"I know it's a cliché, but it is true."
00:27:16.510,00:27:18.762,Good night.
00:27:22.433,00:27:23.976,Good night.
00:28:02.598,00:28:03.890,I love you.
00:28:03.932,00:28:07.603,"I love you, too."
00:28:07.645,00:28:13.484,"So, I will volunteer with foster kids, coach youth sports."
00:28:13.526,00:28:18.071,There are other ways that I can be a father figure without actually being a father.
00:28:23.869,00:28:30.250,"I taught you how to play hooky from work, how to drive, how to drink, and how to totally rock the house in karaoke."
00:28:30.292,00:28:34.046,"No, y-you did not teach me to drive very well at all."
00:28:34.087,00:28:35.589,-Ohhh.
00:28:35.631,00:28:38.300,"-Oh, how dare you."
00:28:38.342,00:28:39.635,"No, you didn't crash."
00:28:39.677,00:28:42.221,You hit a rock that should not have been there.
00:28:42.262,00:28:46.266,The whole point of a road shoulder is to provide a buffer zone.
00:28:46.308,00:28:50.479,"Who the hell desi-- designs a buffer zone with a huge rock in it, you know?"
00:28:50.521,00:28:53.649,They should be fired.
00:28:54.774,00:28:57.444,"O-Okay, hold it right there, partner."
00:28:57.486,00:29:00.531,I got one more thing to teach you.
00:29:00.573,00:29:01.740,What is it?
00:29:01.781,00:29:05.785,The proper way to end a date.
00:29:07.663,00:29:11.208,Tell me you hope I had a good time tonight.
00:29:11.833,00:29:14.002,Go ahead.
00:29:16.380,00:29:19.258,I hope you had a good time tonight.
00:29:22.302,00:29:25.514,You're really fun to sing karaoke with.
00:29:26.724,00:29:31.520,"Now tell me I'm really fun, too, and that you hope we can do it again soon."
00:29:32.563,00:29:36.775,"Y-Y-You're really fun, too."
00:29:36.816,00:29:37.984,Thank you.
00:29:38.026,00:29:40.070,I hope that we can do it again soon.
00:29:46.952,00:29:52.708,"Now, if I just walk in, don't bother trying for a second date."
00:29:52.750,00:29:54.126,"It's a swing and a miss, not a big deal."
00:30:12.144,00:30:14.104,"Kiss me, Shaun."
00:30:31.705,00:30:34.916,Have you ever done that before?
00:30:39.129,00:30:41.715,"Well, you're pretty good at it."
00:30:41.757,00:30:42.841,You want to do it again?
00:30:42.882,00:30:45.010,"Yes, but..."
00:30:45.051,00:30:47.262,But what?
00:30:55.688,00:30:57.773,Oof.
00:31:01.485,00:31:02.528,I know it's frightening.
00:31:02.569,00:31:05.030,You've already been through so much.
00:31:06.699,00:31:08.116,I'm not scared.
00:31:08.158,00:31:13.288,"I just think, What if this is how we're meant to be?"
00:31:13.330,00:31:15.541,Maybe we're better as one.
00:31:20.713,00:31:37.896,"I grew up in a trailer, um, with, uh, my mom telling me every day that I was no better than her and that I would never do anything, I'd never be anyone, and I..."
00:31:37.937,00:31:40.399,I hated being there.
00:31:41.608,00:31:52.118,"But when I finally left, walking out of the dirty, disgusting double-wide..."
00:31:54.413,00:31:57.583,...was the hardest thing I've ever done.
00:31:58.792,00:32:02.755,"Wait, so, am I the awful mom or the disgusting trailer in this story?"
00:32:02.796,00:32:06.466,Um...
00:32:08.844,00:32:12.723,It's amazing what you've accomplished so far.
00:32:12.765,00:32:13.891,It really is.
00:32:13.932,00:32:28.864,"But you can be so much more, and with the freedom to just finally be yourself."
00:32:38.916,00:32:41.919,Katie's back on board.
00:32:41.960,00:32:43.712,Told you.
00:32:43.754,00:32:45.923,She's very persuasive.
00:32:55.223,00:32:56.600,Shaun?
00:33:05.901,00:33:08.821,I feel disgusting.
00:33:08.862,00:33:10.363,You're just hungover.
00:33:10.405,00:33:14.242,You are never gonna want me to kiss you ever again.
00:33:14.284,00:33:21.708,"If I had brushed my teeth before I rushed out here, I'd ask you to do it again right now."
00:33:22.668,00:33:25.086,Why are you so hard on yourself?
00:33:27.464,00:33:33.219,"I'm sure you got made fun of a lot when you were a kid, and that leaves a mark."
00:33:33.261,00:33:34.513,I know.
00:33:34.554,00:33:38.892,"But you gotta shake it off, rub some dirt on it."
00:33:40.853,00:33:44.356,You're never gonna be happy if you constantly live in fear.
00:33:53.907,00:33:55.784,We need to talk.
00:33:55.826,00:33:57.744,"Well, then, you can just listen."
00:33:57.786,00:33:59.746,You are not a victim.
00:33:59.788,00:34:03.416,But you will be unless you convince Andrews to reinstate Jared.
00:34:03.458,00:34:05.251,Are you threatening me?
00:34:11.633,00:34:18.682,And I will make it my mission in life to find every single one and get them to file a complaint against you unless Jared gets his job back.
00:34:18.724,00:34:22.519,And what makes you so sure Andrews cares what I have to say?
00:34:22.561,00:34:26.523,"But either Jared's career gets saved, or yours gets destroyed."
00:34:26.565,00:34:28.483,Either way is a win for me.
00:34:34.990,00:34:36.950,15 blade.
00:34:44.123,00:34:46.585,Removing the first balloon tissue expander.
00:34:58.764,00:35:00.891,One down. Five to go.
00:35:20.869,00:35:24.247,"Glassman: Hi, Shaun."
00:35:35.092,00:35:37.636,Please call me before it's too late.
00:35:37.677,00:35:44.768,and let me know where you are 'cause I'm worried.
00:35:48.814,00:35:59.157,Ko: The cavitron allows us to use a low-frequency sound wave to separate them so that we don't damage the healthy tissue in the process.
00:36:01.910,00:36:07.791,Mm-hmm.
00:36:08.708,00:36:14.131,"But once the patient is opened, it's kind of like backcountry skiing."
00:36:14.172,00:36:16.133,It's never the same on top.
00:36:16.174,00:36:21.513,What you want to focus on is the terrain you know is underneath.
00:36:54.462,00:36:56.506,Cut.
00:37:00.593,00:37:04.056,Grafted sagittal's in place.
00:37:04.097,00:37:05.306,Let's remove the clamps.
00:37:10.187,00:37:12.522,Okay.
00:37:12.564,00:37:15.984,Looks good. No leaks.
00:37:16.026,00:37:18.695,Now the moment of truth.
00:37:18.737,00:37:22.074,"Dr. Ko, would you like to do the honors?"
00:37:22.115,00:37:25.035,Mm. Definitely.
00:37:29.039,00:37:30.373,Can we get a little more room?
00:37:30.415,00:37:32.834,Coming right up.
00:37:44.470,00:37:46.431,And then there were two.
00:37:58.902,00:38:01.780,Thanks for taking me on a road trip.
00:38:01.821,00:38:03.322,I feel a lot better.
00:38:03.364,00:38:07.326,I think I'm ready to talk to Dr. Glassman.
00:38:07.368,00:38:12.124,"Yeah, I feel much better, too, and ready to talk to my boss."
00:38:12.165,00:38:14.667,What do you have to talk to your boss about?
00:38:14.709,00:38:16.253,He offered me a promotion.
00:38:16.294,00:38:19.547,Will you be making $1 million?
00:38:21.507,00:38:28.890,"I make $70,000 now, and the new position pays $90,000, but I'm not gonna take it."
00:38:28.932,00:38:30.349,Why not?
00:38:30.391,00:38:32.936,"It pays $20,000 more."
00:38:32.978,00:38:44.781,"Yeah, I get the math, Shaun, but just taking this trip and -- and you have inspired me to do something that I've been thinking about for a really long time, but I've just been too scared to do it."
00:38:44.823,00:38:47.408,I'm gonna quit my job.
00:38:47.450,00:38:48.618,You're so silly.
00:38:48.660,00:38:50.328,What would you do during the day?
00:38:50.369,00:38:51.746,Rebuild old cars.
00:38:51.788,00:38:55.708,No more conference calls.
00:38:55.750,00:39:01.589,"The only thing I'm not looking forward to is, uh -- is moving."
00:39:01.631,00:39:03.216,Why would you move?
00:39:03.258,00:39:07.679,Because that's where the shop that I'm gonna work at is.
00:39:07.720,00:39:09.139,I got the Striped Tomato.
00:39:09.181,00:39:14.186,"My brother, Donny, got Grandpa Rod's shop in Hershey, Pennsylvania."
00:39:14.227,00:39:28.200,"It's been over a year, but every time I drive his car, I...keep thinking, You know, I don't need a more impressive title or $1 million."
00:39:28.241,00:39:32.912,"He would take me fishing in Alaska every summer, skiing every winter break."
00:39:32.954,00:39:37.292,I haven't taken more than one day off in four years because I always work.
00:39:37.334,00:39:39.169,It never stops.
00:39:39.211,00:39:49.971,"And just taking this trip with you made me realize I, uh -- I want to enjoy my life, you know?"
00:39:52.307,00:39:54.851,"Okay, what?"
00:40:05.737,00:40:07.322,Oh.
00:40:07.364,00:40:09.199,You're...
00:40:24.589,00:40:26.258,Hello?
00:40:26.299,00:40:29.052,"Jared, this is Dr. Andrews."
00:40:29.094,00:40:30.595,"Yeah, of course."
00:40:30.636,00:40:33.306,Dr. Coyle approached me today.
00:40:33.348,00:40:41.689,"He told me that he feels awful about the way he treated Dr. Browne and how it came to affect you, and he asked me to reconsider your termination."
00:40:42.274,00:40:44.609,"You should also know that Dr. Melendez spoke in support of you, as well."
00:40:44.650,00:40:47.195,Thank you for letting me know.
00:40:47.237,00:40:53.159,I was impressed by the integrity you demonstrated by taking full responsibility for your actions.
00:40:53.201,00:41:02.335,"And I'm certainly willing to make that clear to any administrators at another hospital if you need me as a reference, but I won't reinstate you."
00:41:02.377,00:41:05.838,Physical assault is a line I'm just not willing to let anyone cross.
00:41:05.880,00:41:08.216,I understand.
00:41:08.258,00:41:10.635,I'm sorry.
00:41:10.676,00:41:12.637,Take care.
00:41:18.977,00:41:21.062,When will they wake up?
00:41:27.110,00:41:29.195,They should've already.
00:41:31.239,00:41:34.451,Shaun?
00:41:36.286,00:41:39.289,Shaun.
00:00:01.293,00:00:03.002,Previously on The Good Doctor...
00:00:03.044,00:00:05.965,"Lea: You need to take a break, clear your head."
00:00:06.005,00:00:07.382,You need a vacation.
00:00:08.801,00:00:10.010,I'm gonna quit my job.
00:00:10.051,00:00:14.306,"I'm not looking forward to moving to Hershey, Pennsylvania."
00:00:14.348,00:00:16.016,I don't want kids.
00:00:21.146,00:00:24.023,I've just been fired for physically assaulting an employee.
00:00:25.317,00:00:27.027,Go ahead.
00:00:30.030,00:00:32.240,They should've already.
00:00:50.384,00:00:52.344,"We were worried about you, Jenny."
00:00:52.386,00:00:54.346,So glad you're back.
00:00:54.388,00:00:56.390,I am gonna give you three words.
00:00:57.641,00:01:01.228,Apple. Ball. House.
00:01:01.269,00:01:03.814,Can you count back from 100 by 7 for me?
00:01:03.856,00:01:06.483,"I'm going to Harvard, you know."
00:01:16.911,00:01:18.370,And what city are we in?
00:01:18.412,00:01:19.872,San Jose.
00:01:19.914,00:01:21.289,And what were those three words?
00:01:21.331,00:01:24.668,Apple. Ball. House.
00:01:24.710,00:01:27.212,"Look out, Harvard."
00:01:27.254,00:01:32.551,"We'll be doing a lot more tests to know for sure, but your heart does sound better."
00:01:32.593,00:01:34.970,How's Katie?
00:01:35.012,00:01:39.182,"You woke up before her, so too soon to tell."
00:01:39.224,00:01:41.810,There's virtually no alpha or beta brain activity.
00:01:41.852,00:01:44.229,We must have missed something during the separation surgery.
00:01:45.439,00:01:49.526,"Katie's BP was steady, sats were fine, regional blood supplies were reconstructed."
00:01:49.568,00:01:52.780,"Just like Jenny, yet she's awake, Katie's in a coma."
00:01:52.821,00:01:54.573,Ko: Katie's got the new sagittal graft.
00:01:54.615,00:01:57.284,A problem with blood flow in that vein could cause her condition.
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.583,I will proceed with the angiogram.
00:02:04.625,00:02:05.918,Whoa!
00:02:05.960,00:02:07.252,"Murphy, you've been gone for two days."
00:02:07.294,00:02:08.629,How about we start there?
00:02:10.338,00:02:14.009,Just because you talked to the president doesn't qualify as permission.
00:02:14.051,00:02:16.177,Okay. Yes.
00:02:22.476,00:02:23.936,Amazing.
00:02:23.978,00:02:25.604,Road trip?
00:02:25.646,00:02:28.440,Dr. Glassman said you were dealing with a personal crisis.
00:02:28.482,00:02:31.568,That is true.
00:02:31.610,00:02:33.904,Do you know the definition of personal crisis?
00:02:33.946,00:02:40.995,Yes. A stage in a sequence of events at which the trend of all future events is determined.
00:02:41.036,00:02:43.371,"-A death, an illness."
00:02:43.413,00:02:45.082,"No, not a road trip."
00:02:46.249,00:02:47.459,Okay.
00:02:48.877,00:02:54.633,"You and Dr. Browne get going on Katie's angiogram, unless, of course, you have any personal emergencies to attend to."
00:02:54.675,00:02:57.218,No.
00:03:03.851,00:03:04.935,Hey.
00:03:06.854,00:03:08.313,How are the twins doing?
00:03:09.690,00:03:11.859,Her numbers look good.
00:03:11.900,00:03:13.234,Katie -- not so good.
00:03:14.193,00:03:16.488,We need to talk about Murphy.
00:03:16.530,00:03:18.073,I told you he's on personal leave.
00:03:18.115,00:03:19.700,"Yeah, well, that's not what he said."
00:03:21.200,00:03:22.161,You talked to him?
00:03:22.201,00:03:23.996,Yes.
00:03:24.038,00:03:26.081,In the surgical unit five minutes ago.
00:03:28.959,00:03:32.171,There's the sagittal vein graft we constructed for Katie.
00:03:32.211,00:03:35.007,It's open with good flow.
00:03:35.049,00:03:37.009,Graft is fine.
00:03:37.051,00:03:40.762,Which means we still have no explanation for her coma.
00:03:40.804,00:03:43.932,Go in closer.
00:03:46.143,00:03:50.397,"The middle cerebral vein, it has low flow out of the brain."
00:03:50.438,00:03:52.273,You're thinking low flow out means low flow in?
00:03:52.315,00:03:55.027,"Yes, that is what I'm thinking."
00:03:55.069,00:03:59.698,We should look at the arterial inflow phase.
00:03:59.740,00:04:03.410,"We'd like to look at the arterial inflow phase, please."
00:04:09.833,00:04:14.922,"Well, sometimes when we take a road trip, we're running away from something."
00:04:14.963,00:04:18.383,I kissed Lea.
00:04:18.425,00:04:21.553,And Dr. Glassman is mad at me.
00:04:21.595,00:04:23.805,What is he mad at you about?
00:04:25.849,00:04:27.935,It's almost entirely blocked.
00:04:27.976,00:04:32.397,And...there's a malformation in the Circle of Willis.
00:04:32.439,00:04:34.900,Katie is barely getting any blood to her brain.
00:04:36.110,00:04:37.236,Glassman: Excuse me. Shaun?
00:04:37.277,00:04:39.113,"May I speak with you, please?"
00:04:41.823,00:04:45.202,"Oh, no, Shaun."
00:04:45.244,00:04:47.412,He's also angry with me.
00:04:47.454,00:04:48.997,W-Why?
00:04:49.039,00:04:52.584,Why?
00:04:52.626,00:04:54.544,Why did you run away?
00:04:54.586,00:04:56.755,I didn't -- didn't run away.
00:04:56.797,00:05:03.178,"When you leave without notifying your attending, when you drop all of your responsibilities at this hospital..."
00:05:03.220,00:05:09.643,"When you leave without telling anyone, including me, then you are running away."
00:05:09.684,00:05:11.728,Did this trip with this girl help?
00:05:13.772,00:05:16.108,Yes.
00:05:16.150,00:05:19.153,Okay. How?
00:05:21.362,00:05:24.449,I would like to give two-weeks notice.
00:05:24.491,00:05:39.756,"-- Captions by VITAC -- Mom, can you ask them to bring me some more ice chips?"
00:05:39.798,00:05:41.300,"I'll get them, sweetie."
00:06:23.925,00:06:25.552,No.
00:06:25.593,00:06:27.137,I'm just...
00:06:27.179,00:06:30.307,"When you left, there was no one here."
00:06:32.059,00:06:35.770,"For the first time in my life, I was alone."
00:06:35.812,00:06:38.148,Sweetie.
00:06:38.190,00:06:41.400,It felt...cold.
00:06:47.699,00:06:49.408,But you know what?
00:06:49.450,00:06:52.453,"Someday, you might find that you like it."
00:06:58.835,00:07:01.420,Dr. Kalu assaulted an attending surgeon.
00:07:01.462,00:07:03.798,I don't think you have strong legal footing here.
00:07:03.840,00:07:06.301,There's more to the story.
00:07:09.637,00:07:14.726,"And I am sympathetic to Dr. Kalu, but his ends don't justify his means."
00:07:14.768,00:07:17.812,Obviously we can't tolerate staff members -- And yet you do.
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.564,Please read on.
00:07:28.323,00:07:29.741,The middle cerebral has narrowed.
00:07:29.783,00:07:31.326,It's less than 2 millimeters.
00:07:31.368,00:07:34.788,We bypass the artery here and restore blood flow.
00:07:34.829,00:07:36.623,Andrews: Open her back up?
00:07:36.664,00:07:38.541,She's just been through a massive operation.
00:07:38.583,00:07:40.252,The brain tissue hasn't settled.
00:07:40.294,00:07:42.796,Another could very well stroke Katie out.
00:07:42.837,00:07:44.923,Other options.
00:07:44.965,00:07:47.634,Intravascular.
00:07:47.675,00:07:51.638,I don't see how an intravascular ultrasound gives us a better picture.
00:07:51.679,00:07:55.725,He wants a stent in the middle cerebral artery in the angio lab.
00:07:55.767,00:07:58.270,Stenting is usually reserved for the heart and the carotid.
00:07:58.312,00:08:00.981,"It's not the usual, but we are way past the usual."
00:08:01.022,00:08:03.483,It would lower the danger of a stroke.
00:08:06.111,00:08:07.862,"Dr. Murphy, would you like to assist?"
00:08:07.904,00:08:10.240,Y-Yes.
00:08:10.282,00:08:14.202,"Dr. Melendez, would you like to write me a letter of recommendation?"
00:08:18.457,00:08:25.255,"You see the narrowing there, in the horizontal segment of the middle cerebral artery."
00:08:25.297,00:08:28.049,Yeah.
00:08:28.091,00:08:30.093,You're the one making the old guard nervous.
00:08:32.804,00:08:35.890,W-Why would I make people nervous?
00:08:39.936,00:08:43.982,"And surgeons judge themselves against their peers, and right now, you're winning."
00:08:46.401,00:08:47.652,We're in position.
00:08:47.694,00:08:50.071,"Dr. Murphy, please inflate the balloon."
00:08:54.868,00:08:56.828,Give us another squirt of contrast.
00:08:56.870,00:09:00.790,And we should have good blood flow.
00:09:03.251,00:09:06.213,"Yes, the proximal end of the artery is dissecting."
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.714,The balloon is damaging her artery.
00:09:07.755,00:09:09.216,Waveform is worsening.
00:09:09.257,00:09:10.425,Stent won't hold.
00:09:10.467,00:09:12.719,She's gonna stroke.
00:09:12.760,00:09:14.179,Okay.
00:09:21.102,00:09:23.938,Waveform is normalizing.
00:09:23.980,00:09:26.566,We're right back where we started.
00:09:26.607,00:09:28.485,Katie's brain is starving.
00:09:32.113,00:09:34.408,I want to see Katie.
00:09:34.449,00:09:37.994,I know she's in a coma.
00:09:38.036,00:09:39.579,I miss her.
00:09:39.620,00:09:42.040,We can't risk contamination for either of you.
00:09:42.082,00:09:43.624,She needs to know I'm there.
00:09:43.666,00:09:44.625,We understand.
00:09:44.667,00:09:46.753,You can't understand.
00:09:46.794,00:09:48.129,No one can.
00:09:48.171,00:09:52.675,"We have always been there for each other, and now when she needs me most, I'm not there."
00:09:52.717,00:09:55.470,You've just been through a 40-hour surgery.
00:09:55.512,00:09:57.805,We need you to focus on your own healing.
00:09:57.847,00:09:59.474,And what about her heart?
00:09:59.516,00:10:03.937,We're going to do a cardiac catheterization test to see if her heart circulation has improved.
00:10:05.813,00:10:09.859,Inject the contrast to evaluate the heart's blood supply.
00:10:09.901,00:10:11.652,How's my soul looking?
00:10:12.904,00:10:15.323,That's a different specialty.
00:10:17.158,00:10:20.287,Katie says the eyes are the window to the soul.
00:10:20.328,00:10:22.872,I say the eyes lie.
00:10:22.914,00:10:25.542,"Well, then, so far your soul is looking good."
00:10:25.584,00:10:27.461,"Strong, unobstructed blood flow."
00:10:27.502,00:10:30.004,Ventriculogram will tell us how the muscle function's doing.
00:10:42.601,00:10:44.894,So quiet.
00:10:46.438,00:10:48.064,Ventricle's strained and dilated.
00:10:48.106,00:10:51.651,"We were hoping for some improvement post-separation, but it's barely pumping."
00:10:51.692,00:10:53.653,It just doesn't make any sense.
00:10:53.694,00:10:57.491,The separation was supposed to relieve the stress on Jenny's heart.
00:10:57.532,00:10:59.159,"Half the need, half the work."
00:10:59.200,00:11:01.453,Jenny's heart was even sicker than it appeared.
00:11:01.495,00:11:04.539,Seems we couldn't see that because Katie's heart was doing all the work for Jenny's.
00:11:04.581,00:11:05.915,What can we do to fix it?
00:11:05.957,00:11:07.417,Give her a new heart.
00:11:07.459,00:11:09.210,We're not gonna find a donor match in time.
00:11:09.252,00:11:12.422,"Yes, we already have the perfect heart for Jenny."
00:11:12.464,00:11:16.468,The sisters are monozygotic and therefore a genetic match.
00:11:17.427,00:11:19.554,"On the other hand, Katie is alive."
00:11:19.596,00:11:21.973,-She is GCS-3.
00:11:23.724,00:11:26.561,And I don't see a way to return blood flow to the brain.
00:11:26.603,00:11:29.564,"In all likelihood, Katie's not coming back."
00:11:29.606,00:11:32.526,"Yes, Katie very well may die, but we can't predict when that'll be."
00:11:32.567,00:11:34.653,It could be today.
00:11:34.693,00:11:36.112,If Katie stays on the ventilator.
00:11:36.154,00:11:38.365,-That's not up to us.
00:11:38.406,00:11:42.243,"But I also know that, based on these scans, Jenny might not make it through the night."
00:11:55.923,00:11:57.800,There's no chance Katie will wake up?
00:12:02.597,00:12:10.021,"We can't say with 100% certainty, but from what we saw on Katie's brain scan..."
00:12:10.063,00:12:11.648,we have little reason for hope.
00:12:11.690,00:12:16.695,"But what we can say with certainty is that without Katie's heart, Jenny will die."
00:12:18.821,00:12:21.115,Can we wait?
00:12:21.157,00:12:22.576,Just a little.
00:12:22.617,00:12:24.285,Maybe something will change.
00:12:24.327,00:12:27.581,"If we don't do anything, Jenny's heart will stop before the morning."
00:12:31.543,00:12:33.920,How do you...
00:12:37.965,00:12:39.426,Would it be painful?
00:12:39.467,00:12:44.097,No. We simply power down Katie's ventilator.
00:12:44.138,00:12:47.100,"Once off life support, she will peacefully pass."
00:13:03.199,00:13:05.285,Do you want us to explain this to Jenny?
00:13:05.326,00:13:06.785,I'm sure she'll want to be present.
00:13:06.827,00:13:08.413,No.
00:13:19.090,00:13:21.884,I think it worked.
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.637,But this...
00:13:23.678,00:13:26.347,No.
00:13:26.389,00:13:28.433,Jenny can't be part of this in any way.
00:13:28.475,00:13:29.850,It'd destroy her.
00:13:43.531,00:13:48.495,Dr. Shaun Murphy exhibits technical skills beyond his years.
00:13:48.536,00:13:49.496,You wrote that?
00:13:49.537,00:13:50.664,Yes.
00:13:50.705,00:13:52.749,That's why I signed my name at the bottom.
00:13:54.375,00:13:57.003,You think Shaun survives at another hospital?
00:13:58.004,00:13:59.922,I didn't think he'd survive here.
00:13:59.964,00:14:03.718,"Without your endorsement, Shaun isn't going anywhere."
00:14:05.094,00:14:12.811,"I may have my issues with him, but no matter how stupid an idea this may be, I'm not gonna stop him from going after what he wants."
00:14:15.021,00:14:16.939,There's another signature line next to mine.
00:14:16.981,00:14:18.983,It's where the president of the hospital has to sign.
00:14:25.490,00:14:27.074,The chief oncologist.
00:14:27.116,00:14:30.077,This is before I came here in December of '14.
00:14:30.119,00:14:34.708,Dr. Marshall shoved a scrub nurse during a post-op discussion of some sort.
00:14:34.749,00:14:35.792,Do you remember that?
00:14:35.834,00:14:36.917,I do.
00:14:36.959,00:14:41.881,Your response was to settle with the nurse while Dr. Marshall was let off with a warning.
00:14:41.922,00:14:46.427,There's another almost identical instance earlier in that year.
00:14:46.469,00:14:50.056,"In both cases, the doctors in question were white."
00:14:50.097,00:14:53.226,They were censured.
00:14:53.267,00:14:56.730,You think this was a racial matter?
00:14:56.771,00:15:00.066,Do you think I'm racist?
00:15:00.107,00:15:01.735,That I favor white people?
00:15:01.776,00:15:05.780,Then why the leniency then and not now?
00:15:10.034,00:15:12.704,that happened to be white.
00:15:18.959,00:15:20.628,"So, that's our defense?"
00:15:20.670,00:15:22.839,We're not racist.
00:15:20.670,00:15:25.383,We just allow our doctors to assault people as long as they bring in enough donors.
00:15:25.425,00:15:27.385,They were reprimanded.
00:15:27.427,00:15:29.095,And there were no further incidents.
00:15:29.136,00:15:31.931,And how do you think all of this is gonna play out in court?
00:15:36.477,00:15:38.229,Settle.
00:15:40.899,00:15:42.442,Okay.
00:15:46.529,00:15:47.697,Hi.
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.075,Floor?
00:15:51.117,00:15:52.159,Four.
00:15:55.455,00:15:58.541,Shaun asked Dr. Melendez for a letter of recommendation.
00:15:58.583,00:16:01.586,Yeah.
00:16:01.628,00:16:04.130,All I have to do is sign it and off he goes.
00:16:07.926,00:16:10.470,I think...
00:16:20.897,00:16:25.443,"If you don't sign, it reinforces what he thinks."
00:16:25.485,00:16:31.031,"But if you do, it lets him know that you believe in him."
00:16:43.127,00:16:44.921,Can I touch her?
00:16:44.963,00:16:46.631,Of course.
00:17:11.322,00:17:13.533,Are you ready?
00:17:47.984,00:17:49.652,She's stabilizing.
00:17:51.821,00:17:54.073,I don't understand.
00:17:54.114,00:17:55.575,What's going on?
00:17:58.578,00:18:00.496,Katie's not ready to go.
00:18:05.334,00:18:12.132,"She's breathing on our own, which means Katie has normal brain stem function, correct?"
00:18:12.174,00:18:13.843,"It's rare, but it can happen."
00:18:13.885,00:18:15.762,It doesn't change the prognosis for awakening.
00:18:15.803,00:18:20.433,"Off the ventilator with normal vitals suggests long-term vegetative state, right?"
00:18:20.474,00:18:22.560,Yeah.
00:18:22.602,00:18:25.438,We just lost our remedy for Jenny's heart.
00:18:25.479,00:18:27.481,What about ECMO?
00:18:29.692,00:18:31.485,Buys us...
00:18:31.527,00:18:33.487,I don't like it.
00:18:33.529,00:18:36.532,ECMO requires blood thinners.
00:18:36.574,00:18:38.409,It could cause a catastrophic bleed.
00:18:38.451,00:18:41.370,"Well, ECMO and its complications may be our only avenue."
00:18:41.412,00:18:43.664,R-Re-conjoin them.
00:18:44.665,00:18:46.876,You want -- You want to put their heads back together?
00:18:46.918,00:18:49.587,Not the heads.
00:18:49.629,00:18:51.672,"The thighs, the femoral vessels."
00:18:52.840,00:18:55.342,Is it a funny idea?
00:18:55.384,00:18:57.470,I think it's funny that I didn't think of it.
00:18:57.511,00:18:59.097,The girls' blood is identical.
00:18:59.138,00:19:02.642,"No need for anti-clotting meds, so no possibility of a bleed."
00:19:02.683,00:19:05.311,"As long as they're attached, Katie's heart will beat for Jenny."
00:19:05.352,00:19:10.942,"When Katie dies, we sever the femoral connection and transplant Katie's heart into Jenny."
00:19:12.777,00:19:19.283,"We just spent 40 hours separating them, and now we want to put them back together."
00:19:19.325,00:19:21.911,You tried to kill Katie?
00:19:21.953,00:19:24.038,No.
00:19:24.080,00:19:27.000,You took her off life support.
00:19:28.918,00:19:32.005,Mercy.
00:19:32.046,00:19:35.174,You need a heart or you're going to die.
00:19:35.215,00:19:38.427,Katie's alive.
00:19:43.891,00:19:50.857,"Katie's alive in the sense that she has basic organ function, but she has no higher-cognitive brain activity."
00:19:50.898,00:19:54.861,"She's surviving, but she is not living."
00:19:54.902,00:20:05.204,"Hours ago, you thought she'd die as soon as you pulled the plug."
00:20:07.081,00:20:08.791,You were wrong.
00:20:08.833,00:20:12.712,"How do I know you're not wrong this time, too?"
00:20:14.797,00:20:18.425,The demand on -- on Katie's heart is minimal in her resting state.
00:20:25.058,00:20:29.896,I won't ask Katie to be my life-support machine.
00:21:00.051,00:21:03.137,Let's put the sisters in the same room overnight.
00:21:03.179,00:21:07.474,I don't think that Jenny sees herself as an individual yet.
00:21:07.516,00:21:12.438,"You know, I'm thinking the only thing that'll change Jenny's mind about the reattachment is Katie."
00:21:12.479,00:21:16.109,Being close might help Jenny to see her as lifeless.
00:21:16.150,00:21:18.402,Could backfire...
00:21:18.444,00:21:20.780,and cement her feelings that she's killing her sister.
00:21:23.741,00:21:27.453,And then we're in the same position anyways.
00:21:28.871,00:21:30.497,"Okay, do it."
00:21:36.003,00:21:40.967,"Well, what about baseballs that this girl caught at a Giants game signed by Mr. Hunter Pence?"
00:21:41.008,00:21:43.219,"He didn't hit it, but that doesn't matter."
00:21:45.805,00:21:48.849,"So, where is the sporting-goods one?"
00:21:53.187,00:21:54.272,It doesn't?
00:21:58.525,00:22:02.280,"I'm applying to move my residency to Hershey, Pennsylvania."
00:22:02.321,00:22:03.864,Really?
00:22:03.906,00:22:06.700,Yes.
00:22:09.120,00:22:10.788,Are you following me?
00:22:20.173,00:22:21.715,No.
00:22:21.757,00:22:23.509,Shaun.
00:22:23.550,00:22:25.719,I want my own life.
00:22:25.761,00:22:28.764,"I want a life that I control, not Dr. Glassman."
00:22:28.806,00:22:30.975,Dr. Glassman is just trying to help you.
00:22:31.017,00:22:32.392,I don't want help.
00:22:41.735,00:22:44.571,How will I know if I stay?
00:22:47.574,00:22:50.744,Too much stuff.
00:22:58.502,00:23:00.087,We should book a trip.
00:23:02.256,00:23:04.217,Maybe somewhere warm.
00:23:08.846,00:23:12.641,Wow.
00:23:12.683,00:23:14.727,Melendez: You're only folding underwear.
00:23:14.768,00:23:17.063,Mnh-mnh.
00:23:17.104,00:23:18.522,Okay.
00:23:18.564,00:23:20.358,"No, Neil, I don't want to..."
00:23:25.321,00:23:26.947,Fine.
00:23:26.989,00:23:28.991,"Let's go, Preston."
00:23:29.033,00:23:30.368,I'm ready.
00:23:30.408,00:23:31.785,Go.
00:23:34.621,00:23:35.956,Boom.
00:23:52.223,00:23:54.225,You're the only good thing about my day.
00:24:53.451,00:24:58.372,I couldn't even close my eyes until...
00:25:00.582,00:25:04.295,...I could feel Katie's heart beat in my hand.
00:25:11.302,00:25:18.642,"If I do this, at some point Katie's heart will beat for me, right?"
00:25:22.396,00:25:24.064,That's the plan.
00:25:32.114,00:25:35.993,"Then wherever I go, she will always be with me."
00:25:44.626,00:25:46.879,Okay. I'll do it.
00:25:56.596,00:25:58.432,"How you doing, Jenny?"
00:25:58.474,00:26:00.393,I can't feel anything.
00:26:00.434,00:26:02.728,That would be the magic of local anesthetic.
00:26:08.484,00:26:11.404,Vessels are clamped.
00:26:11.445,00:26:13.697,We're ready to proceed with the anastomotic grafts.
00:26:38.472,00:26:41.267,"It's done, isn't it?"
00:26:41.308,00:26:42.976,I can tell.
00:26:44.686,00:26:46.897,"Let's put both the girls' vitals next to each other, please."
00:26:52.694,00:26:54.612,Come on now.
00:26:54.654,00:26:56.865,Give it a few cardiac cycles to adjust.
00:27:09.503,00:27:10.879,How'd we do?
00:27:10.921,00:27:13.715,You did great.
00:27:31.567,00:27:34.111,Ah.
00:27:34.153,00:27:36.780,"Well, they -- they make good candy bars."
00:27:36.822,00:27:40.159,I don't like candy bars.
00:27:40.200,00:27:41.994,I love pancakes.
00:27:42.035,00:27:44.246,"Well, they make those, too."
00:27:54.672,00:28:00.137,I thought this place would provide a challenge for your abilities.
00:28:02.389,00:28:06.810,But I realized I really brought you here because I thought you needed me.
00:28:20.240,00:28:23.827,This is a now signed letter of recommendation.
00:28:25.579,00:28:27.540,But...
00:28:27.581,00:28:29.333,I don't want you to go.
00:28:34.087,00:28:36.215,I'll...
00:28:36.256,00:28:40.511,"I'll let you make your own choices, your own mistakes."
00:28:59.363,00:29:01.281,"I believe in you, Shaun."
00:29:12.668,00:29:17.506,Their blood pressure dropped.
00:29:17.548,00:29:20.259,5 millimeters of Mercury.
00:29:20.300,00:29:22.761,I like when you say their.
00:29:22.802,00:29:24.597,Melendez: You're gonna see some fluctuation.
00:29:24.638,00:29:27.766,BP drops 5 millimeters every complete cardiac circulation.
00:29:27.807,00:29:30.394,Shouldn't the fluctuation be inconsistent?
00:29:30.436,00:29:34.106,Maybe Katie's heart isn't picking up the workload for Jenny as expected.
00:29:34.147,00:29:43.449,Katie: Jenny.
00:29:48.245,00:29:51.039,"I'm -- I'm right h-here, Katie."
00:29:52.249,00:29:57.630,Right next to you.
00:30:00.549,00:30:02.884,Take Murphy and get a shotgun work-up on Katie.
00:30:02.926,00:30:07.055,"I want everything -- EKG, EEG, and labs, and an echo on Jenny."
00:30:30.078,00:30:32.164,Katie has an awake alpha rhythm on her EEG.
00:30:32.205,00:30:34.124,She's doing remarkably well.
00:30:34.166,00:30:37.085,We're still not entirely sure what caused Katie to regain consciousness.
00:30:37.127,00:30:42.466,"Attaching them again could have redistributed fluid into Jenny's system, possibly decreasing the swelling in Katie's brain."
00:30:42.508,00:30:45.177,Just don't know.
00:30:48.096,00:30:51.141,They need each other.
00:30:53.059,00:30:56.647,The issue right now has become Jenny and her heart.
00:30:56.689,00:31:03.195,"When Katie was in a coma, the metabolic demand on her heart was very low, but now that she's alert and active, there just isn't enough heart for both of them."
00:31:03.236,00:31:04.988,What does that mean?
00:31:08.325,00:31:13.163,We're not sure how long Katie's heart can tolerate the strain of supporting Jenny's circulation.
00:31:13.205,00:31:16.542,We'll closely monitor them with cardiac labs and echoes.
00:31:26.844,00:31:27.927,No.
00:31:27.969,00:31:29.388,No?
00:31:29.429,00:31:32.224,I've had CEOs settle for half of what I just got for you.
00:31:32.265,00:31:33.809,I don't care about the money.
00:31:33.851,00:31:36.854,That's beautiful.
00:31:36.895,00:31:44.361,"But, you see, this is how it works because we live in a civilized society -- they hurt you, we hurt them by making them cut you a massive check."
00:31:44.403,00:31:45.821,I don't want them to hurt.
00:31:45.863,00:31:47.197,I want them to give me my job back.
00:31:47.239,00:31:52.452,"A third of your job back is, by my calculation, uh, almost nothing."
00:31:55.581,00:31:57.207,I'll pay you a third of this settlement.
00:31:57.249,00:31:59.668,What are you talking about?
00:31:59.710,00:32:02.462,You'll be paying me more than you earn in a year.
00:32:02.504,00:32:03.881,I want my job back.
00:32:08.134,00:32:09.678,Lunch is on you.
00:32:15.809,00:32:18.604,Are you moving to Pennsylvania to be with Lea?
00:32:21.106,00:32:23.650,Does she know that?
00:32:23.692,00:32:27.696,Lea knows I'm moving to Hershey.
00:32:27.738,00:32:32.200,"Yeah, but does she know you're going there because she is going there?"
00:32:32.242,00:32:33.827,I'm not.
00:32:39.082,00:32:40.876,Lea makes me happy.
00:32:45.255,00:32:48.049,"Well, Lea's not the only one that can do that."
00:32:52.471,00:32:54.097,I'm gonna miss you.
00:32:57.684,00:32:59.436,Lab tech: Your BNP.
00:33:01.647,00:33:05.567,Jenny Kunkler's cardio protein levels are -- I've never seen anything like it.
00:33:05.609,00:33:10.280,"That's because the levels are for two hearts, not one."
00:33:10.322,00:33:12.282,Now Jenny is killing Katie!
00:33:16.077,00:33:17.955,-What's going on?
00:33:16.077,00:33:19.915,-We got to separate them now or we're gonna lose them both.
00:33:19.957,00:33:21.124,In transit.
00:33:26.254,00:33:27.965,J.L.'s gonna do a local on the fly.
00:33:29.174,00:33:33.261,Ko: On my count.
00:33:35.681,00:33:39.017,We can't do this.
00:33:39.058,00:33:40.268,We're gonna do it.
00:33:40.310,00:33:42.020,No.
00:33:42.061,00:33:43.730,We're in this together.
00:33:43.772,00:33:45.774,The way we've always been.
00:33:45.816,00:33:47.776,The way we were meant to be.
00:33:54.992,00:33:56.576,Melendez: It's Jenny!
00:34:37.993,00:34:39.912,It's Jenny.
00:34:46.501,00:34:48.378,Katie?
00:34:48.420,00:34:50.005,She's stable.
00:34:50.047,00:34:55.635,"Her vitals are good, but we have an issue that we need your help with."
00:34:55.677,00:34:57.178,Okay.
00:34:57.220,00:35:01.307,"Um, Katie won't allow us to separate her from Jenny."
00:35:01.349,00:35:05.020,"If she doesn't acquiesce, Katie will clot and die."
00:35:07.522,00:35:10.025,"Nurse: Bring 10,000 units on board."
00:35:18.199,00:35:21.160,We'll clear out and give you some privacy.
00:35:31.212,00:35:32.756,Baby.
00:35:38.177,00:35:40.013,We have to let her go.
00:35:40.055,00:35:44.017,I won't let them separate us.
00:35:44.059,00:35:47.729,I never wanted to do this.
00:35:47.771,00:35:51.399,You used to say we were made this way for a reason.
00:35:54.736,00:35:57.614,I won't let them do this.
00:35:57.656,00:35:59.532,Even if it kills me.
00:36:02.160,00:36:04.621,I want you to look at your sister.
00:36:20.512,00:36:24.057,I can't lose both of my daughters.
00:36:46.245,00:36:48.832,Dr. Andrews.
00:36:50.959,00:36:52.085,It's an amazing case.
00:36:58.675,00:37:01.260,I understand that.
00:37:01.302,00:37:07.433,"And those problem doctors and the ways we police ourselves will be dealt with, should have been dealt with a long time ago, but you stepped over a line."
00:37:07.475,00:37:08.560,I fought for my job.
00:37:08.601,00:37:10.979,You compromised your integrity.
00:37:12.355,00:37:17.610,"The incident with that jerk Coyle had nothing to do with black or white, but that's what you and your lawyer sold for leverage."
00:37:17.652,00:37:20.906,And when you misrepresent racism for something it's not...
00:37:24.951,00:37:26.912,...it sets us two steps back.
00:37:32.167,00:37:34.127,She's ready.
00:37:42.635,00:37:44.429,"Jared, you're on suction."
00:37:50.894,00:37:53.980,Mayos.
00:37:59.694,00:38:03.823,I'm cold.
00:38:24.136,00:38:26.138,Gone fishing.
00:38:26.179,00:38:28.098,Store's closed.
00:38:28.140,00:38:30.183,I spoke to Claire.
00:39:06.136,00:39:08.305,Hey.
00:39:08.346,00:39:10.265,I want to break up.
00:39:14.393,00:39:17.772,Why?
00:39:17.814,00:39:20.733,Because I love you.
00:39:20.775,00:39:22.694,Odd reason to break up with somebody.
00:39:23.695,00:39:25.655,I want you to have everything in your life.
00:39:27.782,00:39:30.576,Which includes kids.
00:39:30.618,00:39:33.412,I told you I was willing to not have kids.
00:39:33.454,00:39:36.499,You're gonna regret that decision one day.
00:39:36.541,00:39:39.294,-I won't.
00:39:39.336,00:39:41.963,"You're just too decent to think it, but you will."
00:39:42.005,00:39:44.716,So what?
00:39:44.757,00:39:46.134,We all have regrets.
00:39:48.469,00:39:50.596,It's not the same.
00:39:50.638,00:39:51.723,This is your life!
00:39:51.764,00:39:59.438,"This is my life, and it'd be more devastating to be resented by you than to have my heart broken."
00:40:02.359,00:40:08.073,And you are going to be a great dad.
00:40:22.170,00:40:24.172,Shaun.
00:40:24.214,00:40:27.466,I wanted to give you something.
00:40:31.637,00:40:34.140,I'm letting you borrow it.
00:40:34.182,00:40:37.310,Bring it when you come visit?
00:40:37.352,00:40:39.104,Okay.
00:40:39.145,00:40:40.563,Promise?
00:40:40.605,00:40:42.648,"You're gonna come visit, right?"
00:40:42.690,00:40:45.318,I promise.
00:40:45.360,00:40:48.988,You've never been to Hershey.
00:40:55.370,00:40:57.997,Can I put my arms around you?
00:41:12.470,00:41:15.598,Are you a good doctor?
00:41:15.640,00:41:19.936,"'Cause when I think of you, I think you are."
00:41:43.751,00:41:46.045,"Remember, I said borrow."
00:00:32.950,00:00:35.202,I was late!
00:00:35.243,00:00:36.996,I just wanted to play one more game at Gary's.
00:00:39.206,00:00:40.833,He looked dead.
00:00:40.875,00:00:42.417,"He's gonna be okay, right?"
00:00:42.459,00:00:44.043,He had a stroke.
00:00:44.085,00:00:46.045,"Well, the CT confirmed a ruptured aneurysm."
00:00:46.087,00:00:49.008,We have to operate to clip the bleeding and reduce intracranial pressure.
00:00:49.048,00:00:50.425,"No, he had a stroke six years ago."
00:00:50.467,00:00:52.720,They put him on diltiazem.
00:00:52.761,00:00:54.095,We're gonna take good care of your dad.
00:00:57.391,00:01:02.604,"Naja Modi -- 28 years old, suffered a burn to her left hand as a result of a cooking accident."
00:01:02.646,00:01:05.816,Are Jared and I being punished?
00:01:10.821,00:01:17.452,Lesson one -- Don't suggest to the the head of surgery that working with the head of surgery is form of punishment.
00:01:17.494,00:01:23.417,Dr. Melendez is very unhappy with Jared for how he got his job back.
00:01:23.458,00:01:28.129,And Dr. Melendez is unhappy with me for t-taking -- taking two days off.
00:01:28.171,00:01:31.759,"I don't think he wants to talk about this, Shaun."
00:01:35.387,00:01:36.889,I was an idiot.
00:01:36.931,00:01:39.391,It's on the stove.
00:01:39.433,00:01:41.769,You wouldn't believe how often we see these types of accidents.
00:01:41.810,00:01:43.520,"Well, there are a lot of idiots."
00:01:43.562,00:01:45.814,"Okay, what do we need to do here, Murphy?"
00:01:45.856,00:01:49.860,A superficial partial-thickness burn should be managed conservatively.
00:01:49.902,00:01:55.407,"Cleanse the area, debride with soft gauze, and then cover with an antimicrobial petroleum dressing."
00:01:55.449,00:01:58.953,"All of which means, this should heal with minimal scarring."
00:02:00.412,00:02:02.581,"Naja, are you having chest pain?"
00:02:02.623,00:02:04.165,I think I'm having a heart attack.
00:02:04.207,00:02:05.292,It's hard to breathe.
00:02:05.333,00:02:07.962,Just relax if you can.
00:02:08.003,00:02:11.172,"Put her on oxygen, a 12 lead EKG, and order a portable chest X-ray."
00:02:11.214,00:02:12.215,"Murphy, let's move."
00:02:12.257,00:02:14.593,Her vitals are stable.
00:02:16.929,00:02:18.263,What the hell is going on here?
00:02:18.305,00:02:20.265,I don't know.
00:02:20.307,00:02:22.684,But it is interesting.
00:02:22.726,00:02:37.449,-- Captions by VITAC -- We've got a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Suction.
00:02:37.491,00:02:39.743,I need to isolate the aneurysm.
00:02:39.785,00:02:42.037,Poor kid.
00:02:42.079,00:02:44.581,Imagine finding your dad like that.
00:02:44.623,00:02:46.750,"Well, that's exactly how I want to die."
00:02:48.543,00:02:52.798,"If the dad doesn't make it, the kid will always remember that moment -- be traumatized by it."
00:02:52.840,00:02:54.424,Because he loves him.
00:02:54.466,00:02:59.387,The idea of dying without anybody getting hurt -- There's nothing sadder than an empty waiting room.
00:03:02.265,00:03:04.643,"Okay, what do you see?"
00:03:07.228,00:03:10.524,"Yeah, the ruptured aneurysm is compromising blood flow to the frontal lobe."
00:03:10.565,00:03:12.484,Prep an 11 millimeter standard clip.
00:03:12.526,00:03:14.069,Are you married?
00:03:14.111,00:03:15.570,Not anymore.
00:03:18.406,00:03:20.742,"Oh, speaking of creeps, you hear Coyle got transferred?"
00:03:20.784,00:03:22.953,they shut him down.
00:03:22.995,00:03:25.246,"Well, yeah, I guess."
00:03:25.288,00:03:27.749,Just wish they'd spent the money on a Pediatric Trauma Pod.
00:03:33.588,00:03:36.050,Clip.
00:03:36.091,00:03:39.386,The EKG confirmed you weren't having a heart attack.
00:03:41.262,00:03:41.972,I wouldn't do that.
00:03:42.014,00:03:43.557,We know.
00:03:43.598,00:03:46.393,The imaging also confirmed that you have considerable lung inflammation.
00:03:46.434,00:03:48.020,Is it possible you inhaled smoke?
00:03:48.062,00:03:49.437,I guess I must have.
00:03:49.479,00:03:51.857,There was a minor grease fire.
00:03:51.899,00:03:52.691,What happens now?
00:03:54.943,00:03:58.697,We put a camera down your throat to see how much damage there is and what we need to do to repair it.
00:03:58.739,00:04:00.365,But don't worry.
00:04:00.407,00:04:01.616,Please don't.
00:04:01.658,00:04:03.160,"Oh, I'm -- I'm sorry."
00:04:03.202,00:04:04.619,The test is absolutely necessary.
00:04:04.661,00:04:05.954,The test is fine.
00:04:07.288,00:04:09.708,"please don't touch me, except for medical purposes."
00:04:09.750,00:04:11.292,"Yeah, of course."
00:04:20.719,00:04:22.387,A number of religions have rules about touching.
00:04:22.429,00:04:24.848,"I don't quite get it, but -- That makes sense."
00:04:24.890,00:04:27.893,People shouldn't touch people unless there's a very good reason.
00:04:27.935,00:04:30.187,"Okay, then..."
00:04:30.229,00:04:31.939,what doesn't make sense?
00:04:31.980,00:04:34.524,The grease fire.
00:04:34.566,00:04:37.861,"The grease fire explains the whole thing -- the burn, the smoke."
00:04:37.903,00:04:41.406,She told us she forgot the stove was hot.
00:04:45.744,00:04:50.624,I'm sure we would have heard more of the story if she hadn't suddenly thought she was having a heart attack.
00:04:55.170,00:04:57.172,Why didn't you fire him?
00:04:57.214,00:04:58.632,Because his story was different than yours.
00:04:58.673,00:05:01.426,And you believe his story?
00:05:01.468,00:05:03.137,I believe your story.
00:05:03.178,00:05:05.180,But you can't prove it.
00:05:05.222,00:05:10.227,And we simply can't make a policy of believing every woman who files a complaint against every man.
00:05:16.900,00:05:20.528,And the fact that your boyfriend assaulted him took away any leverage I had.
00:05:20.570,00:05:21.947,I did what I could.
00:05:21.989,00:05:27.911,"I got him to take a position where he has very little contact with staff, with patients -- outreach chair."
00:05:27.953,00:05:29.663,And it's a lousy assignment.
00:05:29.704,00:05:31.539,"Sooner or later, he's gonna quit."
00:05:33.959,00:05:37.545,If you have any better ideas...
00:05:37.587,00:05:40.132,I look forward to hearing them.
00:05:51.685,00:05:54.729,Lim: You're very lucky.
00:05:54.771,00:05:57.440,The aneurysm was in a small communicating artery.
00:05:57.482,00:06:00.235,We were able to restore blood flow to the impacted brain areas.
00:06:00.277,00:06:01.486,He's gonna be okay.
00:06:01.528,00:06:02.696,Thank God.
00:06:07.617,00:06:10.453,Is this what life is gonna be like from now on?
00:06:13.498,00:06:19.420,"We're gonna keep him here for a few days, do some follow-up testing, make some adjustments to his medications."
00:06:19.462,00:06:21.965,"Hopefully, we'll find out why this happened."
00:06:24.592,00:06:26.011,I have to go.
00:06:27.846,00:06:29.848,Another one?
00:06:29.890,00:06:33.768,Post-operative imaging showed a 26-millimeter aneurysm in the basilar artery.
00:06:33.810,00:06:36.604,"That size and location, we're looking at a high risk of rupture."
00:06:36.646,00:06:40.399,He must have a genetic predisposition -- maybe a connective tissue disease?
00:06:43.862,00:06:47.448,Melendez: Through the pharynx and over to Grandmother's house we go.
00:06:47.490,00:06:51.703,There's the epiglottis and the vocal cords.
00:06:51.745,00:06:53.914,I know you're not happy that I sued the hospital.
00:06:53.955,00:06:55.332,But I'm not gonna apologize for that.
00:06:55.374,00:06:57.458,That makes it simple.
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.460,I did it because I want to be here.
00:06:59.502,00:07:03.422,"I believe I can learn a lot from you, even from your doghouse."
00:07:03.464,00:07:04.758,"I just hope you give me a chance, sir."
00:07:05.842,00:07:08.178,There's the carina.
00:07:08.220,00:07:10.513,Gonna pass into the mainstem bronchus of the left lung.
00:07:10.555,00:07:14.059,Is breaking up with your fiancée traumatic?
00:07:17.354,00:07:23.068,"When I saw a woman get shot, everyone told me it was traumatic and that I should be going home."
00:07:23.110,00:07:26.613,Should you be going home?
00:07:26.654,00:07:28.407,Give me a mucosal brush for a cellular sample.
00:07:28.448,00:07:29.574,Loading it now.
00:07:29.616,00:07:33.120,How long does it take to get over a breakup with the woman you love?
00:07:35.122,00:07:37.916,"I'm seeing a lot of inflammation, but no smoke damage."
00:07:37.958,00:07:39.918,That makes se-sense.
00:07:39.960,00:07:41.836,I thought we were doing this because she inhaled smoke.
00:07:41.878,00:07:43.797,She said she inhaled smoke.
00:07:43.838,00:07:45.799,I didn't believe her.
00:07:48.176,00:07:50.304,Let's get a mucosal biopsy.
00:07:50.345,00:07:54.599,"I move down here, we -- The scope breached her bronchial wall."
00:07:54.641,00:07:55.892,She's hemorrhaging.
00:07:55.934,00:07:58.019,This is bad.
00:07:58.061,00:07:59.854,Type and cross two units of blood. We've gotta move!
00:08:04.734,00:08:06.111,We know there was a burn.
00:08:06.153,00:08:09.030,"Was it something related to the grease fire, or separate coincidental injury?"
00:08:13.243,00:08:17.414,"You don't have a theory, or are you refusing to talk to Jared?"
00:08:23.044,00:08:24.129,That's true.
00:08:24.171,00:08:25.380,Cut this suture.
00:08:25.422,00:08:27.674,Let's approximate the edges with forceps.
00:08:27.715,00:08:31.219,Are you and Jared even now?
00:08:31.261,00:08:33.680,He made a mistake.
00:08:33.721,00:08:35.349,Exactly what mistake did I make?
00:08:35.390,00:08:37.517,This breach was your fault.
00:08:39.227,00:08:42.272,Is that traumatic?
00:08:50.613,00:08:52.282,Where were you?
00:08:52.324,00:08:54.659,I'm sorry. Were we supposed to have breakfast this morning?
00:08:54.701,00:08:56.036,I had an early consult.
00:08:59.580,00:09:00.581,We do?
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.209,Every Monday.
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.502,Every Monday.
00:09:03.543,00:09:05.295,Thank you.
00:09:09.257,00:09:15.305,"If someone punctures the bronchus during a routine bronchoscopy, that's a mistake, right?"
00:09:15.347,00:09:18.016,"Well, I can't imagine how it wouldn't be."
00:09:18.058,00:09:19.684,Why?
00:09:19.726,00:09:23.271,I'm wondering if I need to report Dr. Melendez.
00:09:23.313,00:09:25.065,Dr. Melendez did that?
00:09:25.106,00:09:27.150,The protocol is very clear.
00:09:27.192,00:09:30.278,I need to report it.
00:09:30.320,00:09:33.656,But I've seen how Jared is being treated.
00:09:33.698,00:09:37.118,Will Dr. Melendez treat me badly if I report this?
00:09:40.163,00:09:43.458,But human nature being what...
00:09:43.500,00:09:45.419,Human nature?
00:09:47.712,00:09:48.838,"Shaun, you know what?"
00:09:48.880,00:09:51.591,You should make this decision for yourself.
00:09:55.387,00:09:57.556,In fact -- In fact...
00:09:57.597,00:10:01.393,you should to make all your decisions yourself from here on in.
00:10:01.435,00:10:04.271,"That's what we agreed on, right?"
00:10:10.110,00:10:12.487,Have you considered an endovascular embolization procedure?
00:10:12.529,00:10:13.821,I have.
00:10:13.863,00:10:18.118,"It's a little less risky, but I haven't done as many, so I'm not sure which way we're better off."
00:10:18.159,00:10:21.996,You want me to check the roster -- see if there's somebody available with more experience?
00:10:22.038,00:10:25.625,"I would like to assist, but yes."
00:10:25.666,00:10:27.168,"Okay, here we go."
00:10:29.212,00:10:30.464,"No, he's not available."
00:10:32.006,00:10:35.760,I got a husband and father who presented with two aneurysms in the last 12 hours.
00:10:35.802,00:10:37.720,I'd rather not.
00:10:37.762,00:10:41.015,This particular surgeon was recently...
00:10:41.057,00:10:43.101,transferred.
00:10:47.188,00:10:49.274,Not a chance.
00:10:49.316,00:10:52.777,Coyle is the best available surgeon for the job.
00:10:59.867,00:11:01.953,Our ultimate duty is to the patient.
00:11:04.498,00:11:07.167,"No, it's not."
00:11:07.208,00:11:09.127,You agree he should have been fired.
00:11:14.549,00:11:18.886,So some things have to matter more than who is the most skilled.
00:11:18.928,00:11:24.392,"If we forgive Coyle just because he's good at something, what does he do next?"
00:11:24.434,00:11:26.394,Either he matters or we matter.
00:11:35.903,00:11:39.491,Were you upset during the procedure?
00:11:42.285,00:11:45.372,You think that I might have almost killed a person because you dumped me?
00:11:45.413,00:11:50.126,The fact that you're describing it as me dumping you suggests that you are upset.
00:11:52.920,00:11:54.047,Nobody's upset.
00:11:54.088,00:11:55.965,Great.
00:11:56.007,00:12:01.054,"But you do understand that I have to ask you these questions, that I need a statement from you."
00:12:01.095,00:12:03.056,Yes.
00:12:03.097,00:12:06.226,Here's my statement -- I wasn't distracted.
00:12:06.267,00:12:07.686,I didn't screw up.
00:12:07.726,00:12:08.978,You get all that?
00:12:19.698,00:12:22.450,"Your bronchus was punctured during the procedure, but it's been repaired."
00:12:22.492,00:12:25.078,How?
00:12:25.119,00:12:26.287,Why did you lie?
00:12:26.329,00:12:30.542,"You said that you inhaled smoke, but there was no evidence of smoke."
00:12:30.584,00:12:32.835,"So, what do you gain by lying to your doctors?"
00:12:32.877,00:12:33.836,I wasn't lying.
00:12:33.878,00:12:35.589,I was just...
00:12:35.630,00:12:37.340,"confused, I guess."
00:12:37.382,00:12:40.801,"I was in a lot of pain, and it was all happening so fast."
00:12:42.262,00:12:43.513,My stomach!
00:12:43.555,00:12:45.724,"Naja, what are you feeling?"
00:12:45.764,00:12:47.934,It's really sore and...
00:12:45.764,00:12:51.229,I feel like I'm going to-- Can we get some help over here?!
00:12:51.271,00:12:53.898,Four milligrams of ondansetron.
00:12:53.940,00:12:56.817,"Airway inflammation, abdominal pain, nausea."
00:12:56.859,00:12:59.195,We need a full blood panel and abdominal ultrasound.
00:13:16.713,00:13:19.840,"But without the surgery, he'll die."
00:13:29.225,00:13:33.187,No. I-I won't consent to the operation.
00:13:33.229,00:13:36.441,There really isn't a lot of choice here.
00:13:36.483,00:13:44.699,"Without the operation -- After his first stroke, it -- it took him so long to recover."
00:13:49.537,00:13:51.289,But he did recover.
00:13:55.834,00:14:00.047,He made it clear he'd never want to live compromised.
00:14:02.967,00:14:04.552,Excuse me.
00:14:14.979,00:14:18.065,Thank you for having breakfast with me.
00:14:18.107,00:14:19.900,My pleasure.
00:14:19.942,00:14:22.320,"People lie a lot, don't they?"
00:14:22.362,00:14:23.738,"No, I-I meant it, Shaun."
00:14:23.780,00:14:25.031,I'm happy to spend time with you.
00:14:25.072,00:14:28.117,There are seven reasons that I've thought of.
00:14:28.159,00:14:31.371,There may even be more.
00:14:31.412,00:14:34.415,Do people ever lie without a reason?
00:14:34.457,00:14:35.750,No.
00:14:41.589,00:14:44.091,Reason number six.
00:14:44.133,00:14:45.719,I think you just lied to avoid something.
00:14:45.760,00:14:47.554,You don't like this conversation.
00:14:47.595,00:14:49.930,"Shaun, n-- Shaun, I'm sorry."
00:14:49.972,00:14:52.642,I'm just -- just a little distracted.
00:14:52.684,00:14:57.856,My aneurysm patient -- We're treating him with blood-pressure meds to try and avoid a rupture.
00:14:57.938,00:15:00.941,You should do an endovascular embolization.
00:15:00.983,00:15:02.360,He doesn't want one.
00:15:02.402,00:15:03.695,It could leave him with brain damage.
00:15:03.737,00:15:05.697,I thought he was unconscious.
00:15:05.739,00:15:07.532,He is.
00:15:07.574,00:15:09.743,His wife knows what he wants.
00:15:10.618,00:15:12.912,It's amazing.
00:15:10.618,00:15:15.289,I just -- I don't think I'd be able to do that.
00:15:15.331,00:15:20.587,"She's sacrificing her happiness, her future, just because she knows -- She's lying."
00:15:20.628,00:15:22.004,She's lying.
00:15:22.046,00:15:27.009,"It could be either reason number four or -- No, she's not lying, Shaun."
00:15:27.051,00:15:28.135,She doesn't love him.
00:15:28.177,00:15:29.679,You haven't even met her!
00:15:29.721,00:15:31.765,"You haven't seen what she's like with him, with their son."
00:15:31.806,00:15:33.391,I'm not good at reading people.
00:15:33.433,00:15:38.730,"Well, I am, and -- I think people-reading embraces personal biases."
00:15:38.772,00:15:42.483,I think we should try to avoid biases.
00:15:42.525,00:15:48.364,"Knowledge of human behavior can help us make informed, intuitive decisions."
00:15:48.406,00:15:50.366,"Mm, my way is better."
00:15:53.661,00:15:54.871,All right.
00:15:54.913,00:16:01.085,"If you love someone, you'll do anything to prevent their death."
00:16:07.258,00:16:12.639,This...situation -- There seems to be a conflict of interest.
00:16:12.680,00:16:17.017,So I would like to bring in someone else from legal to handle it.
00:16:17.059,00:16:19.103,"Yeah, I agree."
00:16:19.145,00:16:24.066,"You're an excellent lawyer, but -- But what?"
00:16:24.108,00:16:25.485,Do you think this is my problem?
00:16:25.526,00:16:27.111,It's understandable.
00:16:27.153,00:16:28.488,"48 hours ago, we were engaged."
00:16:28.529,00:16:31.240,"And now, suddenly, you're supposed to be investigating me?"
00:16:33.117,00:16:37.914,"And doing crazy things, like expecting you to give me complete answers to appropriate questions."
00:16:40.374,00:16:42.543,His judgment about my demeanor.
00:16:42.585,00:16:44.462,Seriously?
00:16:44.504,00:16:46.506,I asked you a question.
00:16:46.547,00:16:47.590,You wanted me to screw up.
00:16:49.133,00:16:50.050,So what?
00:16:50.092,00:16:53.805,So we just deal with it.
00:16:53.847,00:16:58.142,"But if you can't even admit that you're not always perfect, then I -- I am not perfect!"
00:17:28.006,00:17:31.217,The nurse says his vital signs are stable.
00:17:31.258,00:17:32.426,No change.
00:17:32.468,00:17:33.845,Claire: That's good.
00:17:37.515,00:17:39.266,It's...
00:17:39.308,00:17:46.816,such a great sacrifice to respect his wishes enough to let him go.
00:17:46.858,00:17:49.193,You must love your husband very much.
00:18:00.830,00:18:04.042,But...
00:18:04.083,00:18:07.127,there could be another explanation.
00:18:07.169,00:18:11.799,Either you love him enough to let him die...
00:18:11.841,00:18:16.095,or you hate him enough to let him die.
00:18:20.016,00:18:24.729,There's a doctor here who harassed me.
00:18:24.771,00:18:31.903,"He made me feel vulnerable, worthless -- neither of which I am."
00:18:31.945,00:18:36.032,But he never hurt me.
00:18:36.074,00:18:46.250,"I can't imagine how I would feel if he did, what I would do, what I would want to do to him."
00:18:49.754,00:18:51.255,What did your husband do to you?
00:18:57.303,00:18:59.472,"No, he's not."
00:18:59.513,00:19:01.891,A good father doesn't hurt a mother.
00:19:01.933,00:19:03.476,Payton loves him.
00:19:03.517,00:19:05.979,All the more reason -- No.
00:19:06.020,00:19:09.065,Payton doesn't know anything.
00:19:09.107,00:19:14.988,"I know you're afraid he'll come after you, but there are people who can help."
00:19:27.333,00:19:30.920,Payton is better off with the memory of a loving father than the truth.
00:19:48.104,00:19:52.316,Methanol is causing her abdominal pain.
00:19:52.358,00:19:54.110,She drank wood alcohol?
00:19:54.152,00:19:55.444,People drink whatever they can drink.
00:19:55.486,00:19:57.363,"Well, she's Muslim -- Wouldn't let me touch her."
00:19:57.404,00:19:59.490,Religious people aren't immune to hypocrisy.
00:20:03.703,00:20:08.248,It's also produced by the liver when the body is exposed to certain caustic chemicals.
00:20:08.290,00:20:11.293,"If inhaled, caustic chemicals could also inflame the lungs."
00:20:11.335,00:20:14.881,"And caustic chemicals also burn, so it would explain all her symptoms."
00:20:17.591,00:20:22.638,Dimethyl sulfate -- It's used in the pharmaceutical industry.
00:20:22.680,00:20:24.348,She's a school teacher.
00:20:22.680,00:20:28.061,"It's also used in water treatment, industrial pesticides, and chemical weapons."
00:20:28.102,00:20:31.647,She has no reason to be involved with water treatment or industrial pesticides.
00:20:31.689,00:20:34.942,But she could be a school teacher and a terrorist.
00:20:45.119,00:20:46.871,We don't have her consent.
00:20:46.913,00:20:49.207,"Technically, the issue is we don't have his consent."
00:20:49.248,00:20:54.294,"We go to his wife because we can't get his, the assumption being that she's operating in his best interests."
00:20:54.336,00:20:57.590,Pretty sure that's not happening here.
00:20:57.631,00:21:01.094,"Go back to the wife, get her to change her mind, or we'll take it to court."
00:21:01.135,00:21:03.096,Okay.
00:21:03.137,00:21:04.471,"Hey, you look annoyed."
00:21:07.600,00:21:09.852,She's a world-class liar.
00:21:09.894,00:21:14.107,"I mean, for all we know, she wants her husband dead so that she can run off with her Pilates instructor."
00:21:14.148,00:21:16.025,I'll get the consent.
00:21:16.067,00:21:17.276,Thank you.
00:21:27.494,00:21:33.584,"Shaun: She has alcohol in her system but won't let us put alcohol in her system to treat it, because she doesn't want alcohol in her system."
00:21:33.626,00:21:36.003,We put her on fomepi-- Dr. Murphy...
00:21:36.045,00:21:37.880,Is this part of your evidence that she's a terrorist?
00:21:39.799,00:21:41.675,There are billions of Muslims that aren't terrorists.
00:21:41.717,00:21:44.762,Is that part of your evidence that she's not?
00:21:44.804,00:21:48.975,I think she's a terrorist because it's the easiest way to explain her symptoms and her lie.
00:21:49.016,00:21:51.185,Do you have a way?
00:21:51.227,00:21:53.646,She had an accident.
00:21:56.899,00:21:59.944,There are a lot of reasons people don't tell the truth other than criminal activity.
00:21:59.986,00:22:01.695,Six other reasons.
00:22:01.737,00:22:05.908,"If a person comes in with a gunshot wound, we have to report it."
00:22:05.950,00:22:09.120,Why don't we have to report someone who might be making chemical weapons?
00:22:09.162,00:22:12.706,Because unfounded accusations can destroy people's lives.
00:22:12.748,00:22:16.877,What does it matter what people speculate as long as the truth comes out?
00:22:19.588,00:22:22.800,Says the guy who played the race card when he needed an advantage.
00:22:22.842,00:22:27.513,"Even if you're right, she's not making bombs while she's in our ICU."
00:22:27.554,00:22:29.849,"Also, you're wrong."
00:22:29.890,00:22:33.936,"If she's not better in the next two hours, I want to know."
00:22:45.239,00:22:47.992,We need you to consent to your husband's surgery.
00:22:50.536,00:22:52.330,I said no.
00:22:54.540,00:22:58.418,"There's a better way, Tessa."
00:22:58.460,00:23:00.254,Leave him.
00:23:00.296,00:23:02.715,Start a new life.
00:23:08.804,00:23:10.056,I'm afraid.
00:23:17.688,00:23:23.861,"If you don't consent, we'll take this to the court, and we'll tell a judge what we know."
00:23:23.903,00:23:26.322,I told you those things in confidence.
00:23:26.364,00:23:28.366,You are not my patient.
00:23:30.910,00:23:33.495,Two things will happen.
00:23:33.537,00:23:37.499,"We will get the consent, and Payton will find out the truth."
00:24:11.075,00:24:14.370,Tessa?
00:24:14.412,00:24:18.540,You are stronger than you think you are.
00:24:38.811,00:24:43.899,Your methanol toxicity is abating -- The treatment's working.
00:24:46.235,00:24:49.696,Um...do you think that I'll be able to leave soon?
00:24:49.738,00:24:54.243,All of your symptoms are consistent with exposure to dimethyl sulfate.
00:24:54.285,00:25:01.083,I -- I've never heard of dimethyl -- Dimethyl sulfate is used to make chemical weapons.
00:25:07.798,00:25:11.593,I didn't expect this from you.
00:25:11.635,00:25:14.680,I made a statement.
00:25:17.183,00:25:19.268,I have autism.
00:25:19.310,00:25:21.395,You've experienced bigotry.
00:25:21.437,00:25:24.898,Yes.
00:25:29.903,00:25:38.037,Have you seen people change their flight because of you?
00:25:38.078,00:25:41.790,Have people cursed you out before you've opened your mouth?
00:25:44.502,00:25:46.586,I'm not prejudiced.
00:25:46.628,00:25:48.588,I have evidence.
00:25:48.630,00:25:51.509,Nobody's prejudiced.
00:25:51.549,00:25:54.552,Everybody has evidence.
00:25:59.557,00:26:01.268,Maybe you're not so different.
00:26:08.817,00:26:11.237,Perspiration is a sign of dishonesty.
00:26:14.490,00:26:15.949,My chest.
00:26:15.991,00:26:18.327,Chest pain can be brought on by anxiety.
00:26:20.037,00:26:22.622,"Oh, but this time, you are having a heart attack."
00:26:22.664,00:26:24.458,"EKG, stat!"
00:26:27.420,00:26:34.134,"The endothelial lining had moderate inflammation that appeared acute, and there was evidence of mucosal edema."
00:26:34.176,00:26:38.264,"I made no extraordinary motions, nor did I apply any unnecessary force."
00:26:40.349,00:26:43.394,"Which is a risk, albeit a small one, with this kind of procedure."
00:26:46.813,00:26:48.566,thank you.
00:26:48.606,00:26:50.859,I appreciate the thoroughness of your answers.
00:26:50.901,00:26:53.237,Not sure I understood it all...
00:26:53.279,00:26:57.032,...but I think I've got what I need.
00:27:03.205,00:27:04.540,That really wasn't relevant.
00:27:04.582,00:27:06.875,"Oh, I-I know. I know."
00:27:08.502,00:27:11.671,"I know she'll get through it, but..."
00:27:11.713,00:27:14.592,it's good you're handling it better.
00:27:14.632,00:27:20.806,It's one thing to be distracted while drafting a contract and a whole other thing entirely doing what you do.
00:27:31.817,00:27:33.944,Inject dye.
00:27:33.986,00:27:36.989,Injecting dye.
00:27:40.409,00:27:42.578,Hanging a left at the vertebral artery.
00:27:45.956,00:27:49.376,"Okay, withdrawing the guide wire."
00:27:49.418,00:27:50.961,Inserting the platinum matrix.
00:27:55.673,00:28:00.471,"You know, sometimes, you do the right thing and things get a little better."
00:28:00.513,00:28:02.640,"And sometimes, things still suck."
00:28:06.059,00:28:10.730,Entering the aneurysm.
00:28:10.772,00:28:12.274,Okay.
00:28:13.442,00:28:14.318,Blood pressure's spiking.
00:28:14.360,00:28:15.319,"Wait, why?"
00:28:15.361,00:28:18.738,"There's no rupture, no bleeding, no stroke."
00:28:18.780,00:28:21.492,"If his BP goes up any higher, he will have a stroke."
00:28:21.534,00:28:23.160,the procedure.
00:28:23.202,00:28:26.163,"Push 20 milligrams of labetalol, stat."
00:28:33.629,00:28:37.257,"We need to stabilize him before we can retry the procedure, which means we need to figure out what we missed."
00:28:37.299,00:28:39.051,This wasn't our fault.
00:28:39.092,00:28:41.345,His BP was stable going in.
00:28:41.387,00:28:44.515,He's been on calcium-channel blockers for the last six years.
00:28:48.268,00:28:49.436,Run a full work-up.
00:28:52.439,00:28:56.151,Why would a 28-year-old with no risk factors have a heart attack?
00:28:56.193,00:28:57.319,Hmm.
00:28:57.361,00:29:00.072,Her heart is burning.
00:29:01.323,00:29:03.450,From the caustic chemical!
00:29:03.492,00:29:06.495,Murphy.
00:29:06.537,00:29:11.041,"Unlike thermal burns, chemical burns get worse over time."
00:29:11.083,00:29:14.253,And it also explains the punctured bronchus.
00:29:14.294,00:29:16.630,The caustic chemical thinned the bronchial walls.
00:29:16.672,00:29:18.465,You did not make a mistake.
00:29:18.507,00:29:20.008,That's not the only explanation.
00:29:21.385,00:29:22.969,But I'll shut up now.
00:29:23.011,00:29:26.890,"You think you have a good idea, but you're going to shut yourself up?"
00:29:26.932,00:29:32.771,It could be caused by an infection from bacteria that leaked as a result of the puncture.
00:29:32.812,00:29:41.154,"The treatments are diametrically opposed -- antibiotics if it's infection, steroids if it's inflammation."
00:29:41.196,00:29:47.745,"If she needs antibiotics and she needs steroids instead, it will suppress her immune system, causing the infection to flourish and kill her."
00:29:47.786,00:29:52.541,"If she needs steroids and we give her antibiotics, then -- I get it."
00:29:52.583,00:29:53.500,We'd better be right.
00:29:53.542,00:29:55.252,Yes.
00:29:55.294,00:30:00.090,"Sir, I think we should bring another senior attending in to consult on this decision."
00:30:00.132,00:30:02.175,"Because if Shaun's right, you're exonerated."
00:30:02.217,00:30:05.971,"And if I'm right, you may have made the mistake that could kill this woman."
00:30:06.012,00:30:07.973,You don't think I can be objective?
00:30:08.014,00:30:10.726,"I think you're incredibly professional -- Shut up, Jared."
00:30:14.896,00:30:21.361,It is possible that I screwed up.
00:30:21.403,00:30:23.322,Let's put her on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
00:30:23.363,00:30:25.491,You're wrong.
00:30:25.532,00:30:29.953,Making a decision on the assumption you made a mistake is a mistake.
00:30:29.995,00:30:33.707,You're very arrogant.
00:30:33.749,00:30:35.917,It helps you be a great surgeon.
00:30:38.211,00:30:40.339,"Fortunately, I don't need your approval."
00:30:51.016,00:30:54.227,We've determined what the underlying problem was.
00:30:54.269,00:30:58.482,What caused your husband's aneurysm to rupture and why his blood pressure spiked in the O.R.
00:30:58.524,00:31:01.193,"According to his labs, he hasn't been taking his meds."
00:31:01.234,00:31:02.986,"As far as I know, he has."
00:31:03.028,00:31:05.322,"I mean, that's just not like him."
00:31:05.364,00:31:07.866,"We don't think it's like him, either."
00:31:10.703,00:31:13.831,You think I had something to do with this?
00:31:13.872,00:31:16.416,"That I, what, threw his meds away?"
00:31:16.458,00:31:20.128,He'd just order more.
00:31:20.170,00:31:28.220,"But if you emptied his capsules and filled them with sugar -- or, even better, salt -- It would end your nightmare."
00:31:31.139,00:31:43.360,"I was willing to let him die, but I could never -- If I were strong enough to kill him..."
00:31:54.204,00:31:58.417,Is there a chance your son knows more than you think he does?
00:32:19.479,00:32:20.980,Her heart rate's 90.
00:32:21.022,00:32:22.900,That's in the normal range.
00:32:22.941,00:32:25.527,But it was 83.
00:32:28.196,00:32:31.116,You were right.
00:32:31.157,00:32:32.325,95.
00:32:35.995,00:32:38.081,I'm switching her to steroids.
00:32:38.123,00:32:43.545,"If we give her steroids, it will suppress her immune system, causing the infection to flourish..."
00:32:43.587,00:32:45.171,I'm going to push 40 milligrams of methylprednisolone.
00:32:45.213,00:32:46.381,...and she'll die.
00:32:48.174,00:32:49.718,This is on me.
00:32:49.760,00:32:51.470,I know.
00:33:00.270,00:33:03.064,We switched her to methylprednisolone.
00:33:03.106,00:33:04.232,It's working.
00:33:04.274,00:33:05.818,You were wrong.
00:33:07.444,00:33:09.905,Just about the treatment choice.
00:33:09.947,00:33:10.697,You didn't do anything wrong in the O.R.
00:33:10.739,00:33:12.324,Don't kiss my ass.
00:33:12.365,00:33:17.287,Jared saved her life.
00:33:17.329,00:33:22.250,"If he hadn't acted so quickly, she would've died, and that would've been your fault."
00:33:22.292,00:33:23.335,"Yes, it would've."
00:33:23.376,00:33:24.503,You should thank him.
00:33:32.177,00:33:34.012,"Thank you, Dr. Kalu."
00:34:29.108,00:34:29.860,Hey.
00:34:29.902,00:34:31.152,Can I help you?
00:34:31.194,00:34:34.031,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
00:34:34.072,00:34:37.910,"You're my new neighbor, number 34."
00:34:37.951,00:34:40.245,"Yeah, cool."
00:34:40.286,00:34:42.205,"Uh, you wanna come in for a beer?"
00:34:42.247,00:34:43.415,No.
00:34:51.464,00:34:53.383,Nice work.
00:34:53.425,00:34:54.718,"You, too."
00:34:54.760,00:34:57.512,You can have the honors.
00:34:59.138,00:35:03.226,This is the first time I'm not looking forward to telling the family it went well.
00:35:30.169,00:35:32.130,You're going to be fine.
00:35:32.171,00:35:34.549,The treatment worked?
00:35:34.591,00:35:37.427,The second one did.
00:35:37.469,00:35:41.306,The fact that you're alive right now is evidence that you were working with dimethyl sulfate.
00:35:41.347,00:35:46.061,"You're a terrorist, aren't you?"
00:35:46.103,00:35:49.522,My brother works for a drug company.
00:35:49.564,00:35:52.525,They use dimethyl sulfate to make one of their medications.
00:35:52.567,00:35:54.069,He stole some for me.
00:35:54.111,00:35:56.529,So you could make a chemical weapon.
00:35:56.571,00:36:03.078,So I could make perfume.
00:36:03.120,00:36:04.121,Smell that.
00:36:17.258,00:36:20.512,It's...beautiful.
00:36:20.553,00:36:21.972,But very stupid.
00:36:22.014,00:36:24.016,Yeah.
00:36:24.057,00:36:27.811,Especially since my brother would get fired if anyone ever found out.
00:36:29.980,00:36:30.897,You believe her?
00:36:30.939,00:36:35.110,Protecting someone -- reason number three.
00:36:37.570,00:36:40.323,So...we good?
00:36:40.365,00:36:42.534,"Thing is, I'm not sure it really matters."
00:36:42.575,00:36:44.369,I've been told I can only have three residents next year.
00:36:44.410,00:36:45.370,That's great.
00:36:45.411,00:36:46.913,Not really.
00:36:46.955,00:36:49.582,"Because of Coyle's transfer, I have to take on his."
00:36:49.624,00:36:52.002,Reznick?
00:36:52.044,00:36:54.504,She's a pain.
00:36:54.546,00:36:56.923,Pain can be a hell of motivator.
00:36:56.965,00:36:57.799,Good luck.
00:37:04.472,00:37:05.807,You were right.
00:37:08.434,00:37:12.647,And I think you were right that I wanted you to be wrong.
00:37:12.689,00:37:15.358,And I'm sorry.
00:37:15.400,00:37:18.611,"You were right, too."
00:37:18.653,00:37:22.365,"I kept telling myself that I'm fine, but..."
00:37:22.407,00:37:24.076,it's been hard.
00:37:24.117,00:37:28.454,"Got me second-guessing myself, maybe affecting my judgment."
00:37:28.496,00:37:31.208,I don't know.
00:37:31.249,00:37:34.002,"If we're hurting so bad, maybe we made a mistake."
00:37:36.629,00:37:38.131,No.
00:37:38.173,00:37:40.383,It just means that what we had mattered.
00:37:40.425,00:37:43.678,Doesn't mean that it was right.
00:37:43.720,00:37:46.305,I've also been thinking that...
00:37:46.347,00:37:48.683,arrogance does make me a better surgeon.
00:37:51.103,00:37:52.478,But it's not gonna make me a better husband.
00:37:55.690,00:37:57.984,I'm sorry.
00:38:10.163,00:38:12.415,Kristin?
00:38:12.457,00:38:13.959,"Hey, I'm Claire."
00:38:14.000,00:38:15.252,Hi.
00:38:15.293,00:38:19.005,Thanks.
00:38:19.047,00:38:30.683,"Um, I am doing some research on Dr. Coyle -- on the women who worked with him and then quit."
00:38:30.725,00:38:36.314,I got another offer at SF Muni.
00:38:36.355,00:38:40.777,I was harassed by Dr. Coyle.
00:38:40.819,00:38:42.737,"And I think you were, too."
00:38:55.625,00:39:01.131,Doing the right thing can make things a little better...
00:39:01.173,00:39:03.549,especially if we do it together.
00:39:25.446,00:39:27.991,I have a new neighbor.
00:39:28.033,00:39:32.287,"Hmm. So, Lea's really gone, huh?"
00:39:32.329,00:39:35.373,"So, can we have breakfast tomorrow?"
00:39:37.083,00:39:39.627,"I'd love to, Shaun, but..."
00:39:42.797,00:39:44.674,"we, um..."
00:39:44.716,00:39:46.218,"We talked about this, right?"
00:39:46.259,00:39:51.639,"I-I said that I would back off if you stayed, right?"
00:39:51.681,00:39:52.640,"More space, less fathering."
00:39:52.682,00:39:54.017,I don't need a father.
00:39:54.059,00:39:55.643,I hate fathers.
00:39:55.685,00:39:58.479,"Right, so -- I need a friend."
00:40:03.401,00:40:08.865,"Shaun, I-I am someone who can't help but give advice, you know?"
00:40:08.907,00:40:12.285,I don't know if I can not do that.
00:40:14.704,00:40:18.624,So you think I can change and you can't?
00:40:21.544,00:40:24.214,I think that we have a certain kind of relationship.
00:40:24.256,00:40:29.510,"And we can call it something different if we want, but we can't magically make it different."
00:40:29.552,00:40:31.512,You said that you wanted space.
00:40:31.554,00:40:33.556,You said that you needed space.
00:40:50.615,00:40:52.200,Shaun...
00:41:06.547,00:41:07.882,Okay.
00:41:11.344,00:41:13.221,Shaun?
00:41:59.725,00:42:04.063,What are you smelling right now?
00:42:04.105,00:42:05.690,Pine trees.
00:42:07.942,00:42:09.152,Mmm.
00:00:13.346,00:00:14.723,"Good morning, Kenny."
00:00:17.976,00:00:19.185,"Hey, hey, hey."
00:00:22.647,00:00:24.733,"Brosef, your cable's out."
00:00:25.275,00:00:27.152,I don't have cable.
00:00:27.277,00:00:30.155,-I have a digital antenna. -Why?
00:00:30.238,00:00:37.537,"Digital antennae receive superior picture and sound quality, and the channels are free."
00:00:37.620,00:00:39.289,"Yeah, but you only get, like, 10 channels that way."
00:00:39.372,00:00:40.749,I only watch three.
00:00:41.249,00:00:42.542,You mind if I run a line to your tube?
00:00:44.127,00:00:45.462,Cable guy can't fit me in till next week.
00:00:46.212,00:00:49.257,"Mm-hmm… Come on, 10 channels are better than none."
00:00:49.549,00:00:54.554,"-Yes, they are. -All right. Gracias, amigo."
00:00:56.473,00:00:57.474,What?
00:00:58.516,00:01:05.690,"Mm… Dr. Reznick was orphaned once Dr. Coyle was transferred, so she'll be joining our team."
00:01:05.774,00:01:07.817,Hi. I'm Claire. Nice to meet you.
00:01:10.487,00:01:12.614,-Are you the autistic one? -No.
00:01:13.364,00:01:14.324,That's me.
00:01:14.407,00:01:16.618,"-Dr. Shaun Murphy. -Mm, hi."
00:01:17.744,00:01:23.291,"We've got two pretty straightforward cases, nice level playing field for an eager group."
00:01:26.377,00:01:32.842,Which can lead to a greater understanding and appreciation of residents' strengths and weaknesses and improve patient care.
00:01:32.926,00:01:36.513,You're playing the same game Glassman had us do when we were interns. Not interested.
00:01:36.596,00:01:40.475,Winning team gets first dibs on assisting on all surgeries next week.
00:01:40.558,00:01:42.143,-In. -Out.
00:01:44.270,00:01:49.943,Mm-hmm… I pick the boy genius.
00:01:53.071,00:01:53.947,That's you.
00:02:05.208,00:02:06.167,Dr. Browne.
00:02:08.294,00:02:10.296,-Kalu. -Dr. Reznick.
00:02:10.880,00:02:12.882,Thank you. I'm looking forward to it.
00:02:15.844,00:02:16.928,Thank you.
00:02:19.180,00:02:21.015,Same stakes as last time?
00:02:21.391,00:02:22.600,Absolutely.
00:02:27.188,00:02:29.107,"Hi, Quinn. We hear you've had some stomach pain."
00:02:29.190,00:02:30.441,Do you mind if we take a look?
00:02:30.525,00:02:31.860,It doesn't hurt that bad.
00:02:31.943,00:02:38.408,"Poor thing says everything is okay, but when Quinnie didn't want to go swimming today, I knew that something must be wrong."
00:02:40.160,00:02:42.162,We'll be as gentle with her as possible.
00:02:44.289,00:02:48.209,"Quinn's parents are out of town, so I, I flew in to babysit."
00:02:48.585,00:02:49.669,Mm-hmm.
00:02:53.506,00:02:55.341,Okay. Let's see.
00:02:59.721,00:03:00.889,-That's a… -Penis.
00:03:02.682,00:03:05.310,She's not a girl. He's a boy.
00:03:18.656,00:03:20.074,I'm not a boy. I'm a girl.
00:03:22.076,00:03:27.790,"No. Quinn has XY chromosomes like Jared and me, not XX like you."
00:03:29.542,00:03:31.961,"No, Quinn has gender dysphoria."
00:03:32.045,00:03:34.631,Her assigned gender is not the one she identifies with.
00:03:34.714,00:03:36.007,"She's mismatched, Dr. Murphy."
00:03:38.676,00:03:40.470,how do you know you're supposed to be a boy?
00:03:43.431,00:03:46.809,Your question doesn't make sense. I'm not supposed to be anything.
00:03:46.893,00:03:49.479,"I am a boy. Biologically, that's it."
00:03:55.360,00:03:56.569,Could be acute appendicitis.
00:03:57.362,00:03:59.405,"Murphy, get imaging to confirm."
00:03:59.822,00:04:00.823,Mm.
00:04:07.580,00:04:10.500,"Mr. Shaw, your chart says that you passed out in class."
00:04:10.583,00:04:12.460,-What do you teach? -History.
00:04:12.543,00:04:14.754,I got a little dizzy because I skipped breakfast.
00:04:14.837,00:04:17.924,"Uh, it's nothing. The school insisted on calling an ambulance."
00:04:18.591,00:04:20.426,Taken any medications in the last few months?
00:04:21.678,00:04:29.394,"Uh, I took some Vicodin after I threw out my back six weeks ago, and then I had a stomach flu, so I took ofloxacin."
00:04:29.477,00:04:36.567,"But the flu part didn't totally go away, so I took azithromycin and prednisone because my glands were swollen."
00:04:36.651,00:04:39.737,"Uh, but I still had a sore throat, so I took some Cipro."
00:04:41.990,00:04:43.491,What doctor prescribed you all that?
00:04:44.242,00:04:46.828,They were leftovers I had in my medicine cabinet.
00:04:48.121,00:04:50.415,"-Uh… -All right, lay back for me."
00:04:52.542,00:04:59.090,"Look, I'm a single dad with twins who bring home every disgusting germ they touch at preschool."
00:04:59.173,00:05:01.134,"Uh, I can't afford to miss work."
00:05:02.760,00:05:07.765,"You've got a fever and you've gone through two IVs, which tells me that you're severely dehydrated."
00:05:07.849,00:05:10.518,You can't stand me touching your stomach without wincing in pain.
00:05:11.019,00:05:13.229,"Dr. Reznick, let's get Mr. Shaw here an ultrasound."
00:05:15.523,00:05:17.650,-We've been trying for a while. -Five months.
00:05:17.734,00:05:21.154,"I realize my prime egg days were two decades ago, but I've been vigilant."
00:05:21.237,00:05:24.532,"Ovulation kits, LH and FSH testing, basal body temp."
00:05:24.615,00:05:26.826,I've checked my estradiol and AMH levels.
00:05:27.410,00:05:28.995,The old-fashioned way wasn't working.
00:05:29.078,00:05:31.956,"Okay, well, there are a lot of possibilities to consider."
00:05:32.623,00:05:34.917,"Many benign, many easily corrected."
00:05:35.001,00:05:38.713,"So I will take some samples from you both, run some tests, we go from there."
00:05:38.796,00:05:39.881,There's a clock.
00:05:39.964,00:05:44.927,"We need to know if we start with IUI or IVF… Both of you, you need to stop worrying."
00:05:45.887,00:05:50.016,"Isabel, you are not the first 40-something woman to come here and ask these questions."
00:05:50.099,00:05:51.059,Myself included.
00:05:52.643,00:05:54.395,"You came to me because you trust me, yes?"
00:05:55.521,00:05:59.192,"Right. So let me do what I do, and you two focus on each other."
00:06:01.277,00:06:02.320,Hey.
00:06:02.987,00:06:06.574,"We're a team, babe. In this together, all right?"
00:06:06.657,00:06:07.742,Okay.
00:06:18.169,00:06:21.422,"I'm afraid, Howard, your appendix has already ruptured."
00:06:23.382,00:06:28.012,"Wait. I need to figure out who's gonna take care of my kids, call the school, so they can get subs for my classes."
00:06:28.096,00:06:32.517,"Mr. Shaw, if we don't get you into surgery now your infection could spread and you could become septic."
00:06:32.600,00:06:36.104,Dr. Browne will make all the necessary phone calls while I prep you for surgery.
00:06:36.187,00:06:37.814,"Isn't that so, Dr. Browne?"
00:06:40.066,00:06:42.610,"You're in good hands, Mr. Shaw. We've got you covered."
00:06:42.693,00:06:43.778,Let's go.
00:06:53.704,00:06:56.874,"-Do you wear dresses? -Murphy, don't."
00:06:56.958,00:06:59.836,Quinn is a boy who thinks he's a girl.
00:06:59.919,00:07:01.796,I want to know why he thinks that.
00:07:01.879,00:07:04.215,"Sometimes I wear dresses, but sometimes I wear leggings."
00:07:04.882,00:07:07.510,Do you like the color pink?
00:07:10.179,00:07:11.389,Do you play with dolls?
00:07:11.472,00:07:14.016,"Since I was five, but I'm super into mermaids."
00:07:14.100,00:07:16.853,"-Do you take dance? -Murphy, 20 questions are up."
00:07:16.936,00:07:18.354,I only asked four.
00:07:19.730,00:07:21.774,-The CT's ready. Let's go. -Do you always paint your nails?
00:07:21.858,00:07:22.859,Let's go.
00:07:34.662,00:07:37.623,"Lavage or no lavage, Dr. Browne?"
00:07:37.707,00:07:44.172,Lavage before closing the wound decreases residual fluid accumulation and minimizes residual contamination.
00:07:50.595,00:07:51.721,"Well, someone did their homework."
00:07:51.804,00:07:53.931,I'm partial to AMSURG since they published me.
00:07:55.224,00:07:56.309,As a medical student?
00:07:56.392,00:08:01.939,It was about the cost and stabilization of disease in patients undergoing transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement.
00:08:02.023,00:08:04.066,Are you thinking of specializing in cardio-thoracic?
00:08:04.525,00:08:05.735,A girl can dream.
00:08:07.195,00:08:08.404,Staple up and close up.
00:08:10.990,00:08:14.535,"Well, it's, uh, it's good to have you on board, Morgan."
00:08:15.536,00:08:17.455,It's great to have another female surgeon.
00:08:19.332,00:08:26.714,"Oh, uh… I'm sorry, you and I are not gonna be friends, and hanging out, having sleepovers, braiding each other's hair."
00:08:27.507,00:08:30.051,That's not exactly where I was going with it.
00:08:30.134,00:08:33.095,"When residency's over, the hospital's likely only keeping two of us."
00:08:33.554,00:08:35.431,"Shaun is Glassman's pet project, so he's in."
00:08:35.806,00:08:38.059,"Jared is persona non grata, so he's out."
00:08:38.142,00:08:41.354,"Which means every time you win, I lose. And vice versa."
00:08:45.858,00:08:47.068,Thanks for the heads up.
00:08:57.745,00:09:01.916,Do you think he's complicated or confused?
00:09:03.125,00:09:05.419,"Dude, you've got to quit calling her a he."
00:09:05.503,00:09:08.172,We're never going to win this competition with you disrespecting our patient.
00:09:08.256,00:09:09.882,Don't they have transgender people in Wyoming?
00:09:09.966,00:09:16.222,Okay. Transgender patient care was not part of my medical school curriculum.
00:09:16.305,00:09:17.723,Was it part of yours?
00:09:18.766,00:09:19.850,No.
00:09:25.189,00:09:28.150,Quinn doesn't have appendicitis.
00:09:28.234,00:09:31.070,He has testicular cancer.
00:09:34.198,00:09:35.283,She.
00:09:39.120,00:09:42.206,We found a mass on Quinn's left testicle.
00:09:42.290,00:09:44.542,"-She has cancer, but… -Am I gonna die?"
00:09:44.625,00:09:46.586,"No, no. Prognosis is very good."
00:09:46.669,00:09:49.755,"We've caught it before it spread, and we'll do surgery on the mass to remove it."
00:09:49.839,00:09:52.842,The CT also showed he has osteopenia.
00:09:56.887,00:10:01.100,"Uh… -Quinnie, it's your mom. I have to… -Of course."
00:10:04.478,00:10:06.814,"Osteopenia. That's low bone density, right?"
00:10:06.897,00:10:08.566,Yeah. How'd you know that?
00:10:09.984,00:10:11.110,Do you know how I got cancer?
00:10:11.193,00:10:21.245,"There are several possible causes, but I would… Microlithiasis, mumps, hypospadias… -Murphy. -Intraepithelial germ cell neoplasia… -Inguinal hernia, HIV… -Murphy? Enough."
00:10:22.288,00:10:23.956,Your parents are on their way here.
00:10:24.040,00:10:28.210,"Um, they just told me… Quinn, are you on puberty blockers?"
00:10:31.088,00:10:32.882,That's the likely cause of the osteopenia.
00:10:33.549,00:10:35.509,Are you taking leuprorelin or histrelin?
00:10:37.803,00:10:39.347,"Well, why didn't you say anything earlier?"
00:10:40.640,00:10:42.600,Because my parents didn't want my grandma to know.
00:10:47.730,00:10:49.065,Looks like he has an abscess.
00:10:49.357,00:10:50.566,You have an infection.
00:10:50.650,00:10:52.693,"We'll drain it, put you on antibiotics."
00:10:52.777,00:10:53.778,It's nothing to worry about.
00:10:53.861,00:10:55.821,It just means you might be in the hospital a couple of extra nights.
00:10:57.782,00:10:59.075,I need to get out of here.
00:10:59.450,00:11:01.410,Are you worried about your kids?
00:11:01.494,00:11:06.415,"Well, they're with my sister, they're safe, but they've never spent a night without me since they were born."
00:11:06.749,00:11:09.543,"Well, then consider this a blessing. A free vacation from your kids."
00:11:09.960,00:11:11.170,They're my life.
00:11:15.299,00:11:18.511,My wife died of ovarian cancer last year.
00:11:22.098,00:11:24.767,"I, uh… I hate hospitals."
00:11:25.643,00:11:26.852,I'm so sorry.
00:11:26.936,00:11:30.856,Why don't I find a laptop so you can Skype with them?
00:11:31.899,00:11:36.070,And I'll rustle up a couple of toy bears from Peds for you to take home.
00:11:36.654,00:11:37.738,Thank you.
00:11:40.449,00:11:45.871,I want to reassure you that the puberty blockers are in no way responsible for causing cancer.
00:11:45.955,00:11:48.666,The leuprorelin did cause your osteopenia.
00:11:48.749,00:11:50.918,Does this mean I have to stop taking puberty blockers?
00:11:54.672,00:11:56.173,but the puberty blockers are hurting you.
00:11:56.257,00:11:57.341,You'll be fine without them.
00:12:03.472,00:12:06.934,"or hair all over my body. You can't reverse that, can you?"
00:12:07.893,00:12:09.520,"No, I'm afraid not."
00:12:17.820,00:12:20.239,"Girls have body hair, too."
00:12:29.123,00:12:32.710,"Toy bears, Skype with kids? You've got game."
00:12:35.671,00:12:38.757,I believe the name for what I did is basic human decency.
00:12:41.635,00:12:44.763,"Sometimes it's conscious, sometimes it's not, but it's always there."
00:12:44.847,00:12:47.725,And you've got this whole queen of kindness thing down pat.
00:12:50.102,00:12:52.563,"Mm, not cynical. Just the reality of how the world works."
00:12:54.690,00:12:55.774,It's Howard.
00:12:56.859,00:13:00.446,"He spiked a fever, temp's 105. BP's tanking, 80 over 40."
00:13:01.864,00:13:03.866,Site's clean. Infection should be clearing by now.
00:13:04.116,00:13:06.160,-What's going on? -I don't know. Page Melendez.
00:13:06.243,00:13:09.955,"Give me 500 milligrams acetaminophen, two grams of meropenem IV infusion empirically."
00:13:10.039,00:13:12.583,"Run a full chem panel, CBC, and get cultures ASAP."
00:13:13.834,00:13:16.253,"Hang in there, Howard. We're gonna figure this out."
00:13:26.138,00:13:27.890,Big backup today. Nothing much I can do.
00:13:27.973,00:13:30.392,-Text you when they're ready? -Yeah.
00:13:33.521,00:13:36.690,I saw raspberry and rose petal doughnuts in the cafeteria today.
00:13:36.774,00:13:37.983,Got you the last one.
00:13:38.484,00:13:41.487,You remembered. Thank you.
00:13:41.779,00:13:44.490,Howard Shaw's labs. I put a rush on 'em for you.
00:13:44.573,00:13:46.075,You're the best.
00:13:47.201,00:13:49.119,Why did you give Gus a doughnut?
00:13:51.580,00:13:52.790,I was being nice.
00:13:53.040,00:13:56.001,I needed my patient's labs expedited. Gus likes doughnuts.
00:14:00.965,00:14:01.882,See you later.
00:14:07.346,00:14:08.847,Howard has a superbug.
00:14:10.432,00:14:11.600,A c. diff infection?
00:14:11.684,00:14:13.435,It's resistant to all medication.
00:14:18.941,00:14:20.693,so we can do the surgery first thing in the morning.
00:14:20.776,00:14:24.071,The procedure is called a radical inguinal orchiectomy.
00:14:24.697,00:14:28.742,It's radical in that the entire cancerous testicle is removed.
00:14:28.826,00:14:31.203,"Uh, all functionality will remain the same."
00:14:31.287,00:14:34.206,Quinn should be able to resume her normal activities in one or two weeks.
00:14:37.293,00:14:40.754,"Without the puberty blockers, I'll be the freak in ballet with a mustache."
00:14:40.838,00:14:42.464,Aren't there any other options?
00:14:43.340,00:14:48.888,"-I wish there were. -If we do a bilateral orchiectomy, Quinn will have the testosterone level of a girl."
00:14:51.098,00:14:53.225,You want to castrate my grandson?
00:14:53.309,00:14:54.393,-No! -No!
00:14:54.476,00:14:57.479,-Oh… -I'm so sorry for Dr. Murphy's outburst.
00:14:58.439,00:15:01.775,I'm gonna have gender confirmation surgery when I'm 18 anyway.
00:15:01.859,00:15:02.902,Why not just do it now?
00:15:06.530,00:15:11.702,Quinn is a child who still plays dress-up and make-believe.
00:15:12.119,00:15:14.371,He may want to have children of his own someday.
00:15:16.540,00:15:18.375,-We'll give you some privacy. -Thank you.
00:15:23.672,00:15:25.799,-I will not allow you… -It's not up to you.
00:15:28.677,00:15:31.096,"You are making me doubt the wisdom of drafting you, Murphy."
00:15:31.180,00:15:34.558,"If you go around saying inflammatory things to people, it will only upset them."
00:15:34.642,00:15:38.395,How will I know if I said something inflammatory until I say it?
00:15:41.941,00:15:45.027,Which you can do while the two of you prep an SDA for this case.
00:15:45.861,00:15:47.237,An SDA?
00:15:47.321,00:15:52.534,"A Shared Decision Aid is a paper presenting the pros and cons of making a difficult… I know what it is, Murphy."
00:15:52.785,00:15:54.036,But why am I being punished?
00:15:54.119,00:15:55.579,"It's not a punishment, it's necessary."
00:15:55.663,00:15:59.041,It'll help Quinn's family understand all the options available to them for her care.
00:15:59.667,00:16:00.501,Understood?
00:16:01.460,00:16:02.670,Understood.
00:16:05.839,00:16:10.010,The stool culture and sensitivity tests indicate that you're resistant to every antibiotic.
00:16:10.094,00:16:12.554,Which only happens when you've been exposed to every antibiotic.
00:16:12.638,00:16:15.474,I… I did this to myself?
00:16:17.434,00:16:19.770,But I've used those medications before without a problem.
00:16:19.853,00:16:20.938,Why did this happen now?
00:16:23.273,00:16:27.987,"You weren't under a doctor's care, so you were likely taking the wrong medication for the wrong symptoms."
00:16:28.278,00:16:29.530,"But you can fix this, right?"
00:16:29.613,00:16:36.328,"We're gonna have to perform a colostomy, where we attach an ostomy pouching system to your abdomen to collect waste from your body."
00:16:37.329,00:16:38.455,For how long?
00:16:38.539,00:16:41.458,"Well, with the level of damage we're seeing throughout the colon, indefinitely."
00:16:44.753,00:16:46.046,"I'm so sorry, Howard."
00:16:54.847,00:16:59.059,I don't understand why you'd suggest the bilateral orchiectomy when you don't even believe Quinn's a girl.
00:16:59.143,00:17:01.770,I was answering Dr. Lim's question.
00:17:01.854,00:17:04.857,"She said there were no other options, but I found one."
00:17:05.524,00:17:08.360,-And now we're here. -Yes.
00:17:11.572,00:17:13.323,Yes. We are being helpful.
00:17:15.492,00:17:17.536,"We're not doing this to be helpful, Murphy."
00:17:17.619,00:17:21.165,"We're doing this because you pissed off Lim, and I'm collateral damage."
00:17:22.207,00:17:24.626,Okay. We're still being helpful.
00:17:28.756,00:17:29.840,Doesn't matter.
00:17:30.382,00:17:32.009,"Doesn't matter, competition's over."
00:17:32.926,00:17:33.844,Is it?
00:17:34.553,00:17:35.804,We're in here and not with the patient.
00:17:35.888,00:17:39.391,"No face time, plus you calling her a he, equals crappy survey scores."
00:17:42.728,00:17:43.687,It is to me.
00:17:47.941,00:17:49.151,I'm a pariah.
00:17:50.194,00:17:52.321,These scores are part of our resident evaluation.
00:17:54.656,00:17:55.866,"Mine does, at least."
00:18:01.121,00:18:05.542,Then we should do this scut work very well.
00:18:16.220,00:18:17.429,Finola called.
00:18:18.138,00:18:21.475,She found an irregularity with one of the tests but wants to re-run it to be sure.
00:18:21.892,00:18:26.063,"Okay, so… We wait until she re-runs it."
00:18:26.146,00:18:28.565,"Marcus, we're both doctors."
00:18:29.441,00:18:30.859,The results aren't gonna change.
00:18:34.947,00:18:36.365,I waited too long.
00:18:38.325,00:18:39.535,It's all my fault.
00:18:43.997,00:18:46.416,"This is the part where you say, No, babe, it isn't."
00:18:47.000,00:18:49.753,"You had goals, other priorities."
00:18:50.879,00:18:55.968,You said you supported my career choices… -Just like I supported yours. -I do support you. Always.
00:18:56.927,00:18:58.387,And I am so proud of you.
00:18:58.470,00:19:01.974,But it came at a cost that we both knew was possible.
00:19:02.516,00:19:04.017,We should have started trying sooner.
00:19:04.351,00:19:07.396,"When? When you were 3,000 miles away teaching at Dartmouth?"
00:19:07.479,00:19:09.731,"Or, what, when you were chasing down head of surgery?"
00:19:09.815,00:19:11.024,We would have figured it out.
00:19:11.108,00:19:13.569,Figuring it out would have meant me and a nanny raising a baby.
00:19:13.652,00:19:14.570,I didn't want that.
00:19:14.653,00:19:17.364,"I tried to bring it u four years ago, but you wanted to get your practice up and running."
00:19:17.447,00:19:19.032,"A baby didn't fit in that picture, either."
00:19:19.116,00:19:20.325,It is not the same.
00:19:20.701,00:19:22.911,How many pregnant women get hired for anything?
00:19:22.995,00:19:26.915,"Or when they find out a woman's got a child at home, suddenly it's all, Who's gonna take care of the baby?"
00:19:26.999,00:19:28.792,No one asks men that question.
00:19:28.876,00:19:30.502,"Well, none of it matters now."
00:19:31.753,00:19:33.046,Right? Because it's probably too late.
00:19:33.130,00:19:35.382,And I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen.
00:19:37.718,00:19:39.219,You've been stewing over this.
00:19:40.554,00:19:42.055,Resenting me. For how long?
00:19:42.931,00:19:44.474,"I don't resent you, Is."
00:19:44.558,00:19:52.983,"But, you know, if you want me to sit here and tell you that it's not your fault, I… I can't do that, I'm sorry."
00:19:57.988,00:20:13.045,Li… Hey. You like?
00:20:13.587,00:20:16.465,"-That door was locked. -Oh, I know."
00:20:17.758,00:20:20.886,"The cable guy had a cancellation, so he hooked me up, got us a two-for-one."
00:20:21.595,00:20:23.013,Little thanks for being so chill earlier.
00:20:23.096,00:20:25.432,"Mm, gracias, amigo."
00:20:32.689,00:20:33.899,"So, what kind of doctor are you?"
00:20:36.860,00:20:38.987,-I'm a surgeon. -A surgeon?
00:20:39.738,00:20:41.573,"Your stuff doesn't say surgeon, does it?"
00:20:42.824,00:20:44.785,"It's like, uh, Selena and Justin."
00:20:46.995,00:20:48.205,It doesn't really go together.
00:20:49.331,00:20:50.749,"Furniture's from, like, a dozen different places."
00:20:50.832,00:20:51.833,Fourteen.
00:20:53.043,00:20:54.086,Fourteen.
00:20:54.169,00:20:59.091,"The people in Casper knew I didn't have any money, so they gave me things to make a home."
00:20:59.758,00:21:03.845,"The bookshelf is from Jennifer, the town librarian."
00:21:11.561,00:21:19.903,"Dr. Glassman, he got me my bed… Well, you don't have to tell me the whole list, but… Okay. Yes."
00:21:20.195,00:21:23.865,Everything I have works. There is no need to change it.
00:21:23.949,00:21:25.033,Respect.
00:21:43.427,00:21:45.053,Mm… Hi.
00:21:46.054,00:21:47.347,-I'm Dr. Glassman. -Hi.
00:21:47.431,00:21:49.975,-I'm the president of the hospital. -Is everything okay?
00:21:50.350,00:21:51.435,Sit down.
00:21:56.773,00:22:03.196,"However, her grandmother has made a claim of child abuse against you and your husband."
00:22:03.989,00:22:18.211,"She's claiming that putting Quinn on puberty blockers, and, these are her words… Making her think that being trans is okay, is a form of emotional and physical abuse."
00:22:20.756,00:22:25.302,"Now, just to be clear, we don't believe any of these allegations have any merit whatsoever."
00:22:25.385,00:22:28.263,"I know my mom, okay? She's not gonna drop this."
00:22:28.346,00:22:29.723,She'll go to court.
00:22:29.806,00:22:31.099,Could she get custody?
00:22:31.183,00:22:35.020,"Well, she could try, but, uh, Dr. Lim would testify."
00:22:36.438,00:22:38.273,-They could put her in a foster home. -Hey.
00:22:38.857,00:22:40.067,"Ty, she won't make it."
00:22:40.484,00:22:44.446,"If we let Quinn do the surgery she wants now, it'll all be over."
00:22:45.280,00:22:47.115,There will be no reason for Ruth to fight us.
00:22:48.533,00:22:49.451,Yeah?
00:22:49.534,00:22:50.535,Yeah.
00:22:53.455,00:22:54.748,Do what Quinn wants.
00:22:55.332,00:22:56.625,Do the bilateral surgery.
00:23:06.218,00:23:07.719,There is an issue.
00:23:08.345,00:23:12.682,Your tests confirmed abnormalities in the semen parameters.
00:23:16.728,00:23:18.647,-I beg your pardon? -The semen analysis.
00:23:22.984,00:23:24.277,-It's my fault? -No.
00:23:24.361,00:23:26.613,We… We do not speak in terms of fault.
00:23:29.366,00:23:34.788,"15% of all couples struggle with infertility, and of those, 50% have a male factor component."
00:23:39.042,00:23:40.252,So what's the next step?
00:23:40.335,00:23:43.255,I'm gonna refer you to Dr. Arjun Dhillon.
00:23:43.505,00:23:49.094,"He's an excellent urologist, and he'll give Marcus a full physical, do some blood work, and an ultrasound."
00:23:49.553,00:23:50.971,-That can't be right. -Marcus.
00:23:51.054,00:23:54.307,-It can't be right. -Marcus. We got this. Okay?
00:23:54.724,00:23:56.226,We're gonna get through this together.
00:24:03.441,00:24:05.277,Hey. Hey!
00:24:05.360,00:24:07.445,Why didn't you tell me Howard's labs came back?
00:24:07.529,00:24:09.322,I should have been there when you broke the bad news to him.
00:24:09.406,00:24:11.825,So Melendez could see your touching bedside manner?
00:24:12.742,00:24:15.537,"-It doesn't matter anyway. -Oh, it doesn't? How the hell not?"
00:24:17.122,00:24:18.623,The poor guy's getting a colostomy.
00:24:18.707,00:24:20.333,There's no way we're winning this competition.
00:24:22.169,00:24:24.963,You really have no sympathy for what Howard's going through.
00:24:25.046,00:24:26.756,"It's a major bummer, no doubt."
00:24:26.840,00:24:29.968,But we don't have time to get emotionally invested in every patient that we treat.
00:24:30.510,00:24:33.638,"Our job is to go in, do the surgery, and get out."
00:24:33.722,00:24:38.351,"Afterwards, his poop, someone else's poop, it's not our problem."
00:24:39.728,00:24:40.645,"Hey, well, wait."
00:24:42.105,00:24:44.441,What if we could get Howard a fecal microbiota transplant?
00:24:46.401,00:24:48.069,FMT for a surgical case?
00:24:48.153,00:24:54.993,"Theoretically, we transfer healthy feces to him, it restores good flora to the body, kills off the CDI, and he avoids surgery altogether."
00:24:56.494,00:24:58.038,We could actually win this thing.
00:24:59.623,00:25:02.459,I'm gonna pull all the research before pitching it to Melendez.
00:25:07.672,00:25:10.383,a Challenging Patient Consultation Process.
00:25:10.467,00:25:13.929,"The name sucks, but there are things about it I do like."
00:25:14.971,00:25:20.185,All you got to do is talk and listen and try to understand each other.
00:25:20.518,00:25:23.480,What's to understand? Ruth accused us of being child abusers.
00:25:23.563,00:25:26.149,And what's to discuss? We are Quinn's parents.
00:25:26.233,00:25:27.943,We get to make her medical decisions.
00:25:28.026,00:25:29.694,What if Quinnie's better off as a boy?
00:25:29.778,00:25:33.156,You have no idea what Quinn has been through.
00:25:35.867,00:25:37.452,Every kid is confused.
00:25:37.535,00:25:40.664,"Quinn has always told us exactly who she was, ever since she was three."
00:25:40.747,00:25:43.500,So you let Quinn play with dolls. Big deal.
00:25:43.583,00:25:48.004,You don't make life-altering decisions because a child wants to be a princess.
00:25:52.592,00:25:55.637,We used to let Quinn do whatever she wanted at home.
00:25:56.263,00:26:00.517,"But when she went out in public, we made her present as a boy."
00:26:02.310,00:26:03.812,It felt false to her.
00:26:04.562,00:26:05.772,She hated it.
00:26:06.523,00:26:07.607,She hated herself.
00:26:07.691,00:26:10.860,"She became reclusive, depressed."
00:26:20.537,00:26:21.746,Sorry I'm late.
00:26:32.507,00:26:37.387,Howard might not need the colostomy if we give him a fecal microbiota transplant.
00:26:39.097,00:26:40.849,Hasn't the FDA gone back and forth on that?
00:26:41.641,00:26:44.394,We could be introducing new bacteria into his system that could kill him.
00:26:44.477,00:26:45.812,The likelihood of that is low.
00:26:45.895,00:26:46.938,But not zero.
00:26:47.022,00:26:49.607,"But if we do the colostomy, we may not really be helping him."
00:26:49.691,00:26:53.903,15 to 30% of patients get recurrent CDI after the initial bout.
00:26:53.987,00:26:55.071,That's a good point.
00:26:55.155,00:27:00.243,"I believe 65% of that time, recurrent CDI becomes chronic, which can lead to repeated hospitalizations and death."
00:27:03.788,00:27:05.081,"Are my numbers right, Claire?"
00:27:05.165,00:27:06.249,Yes.
00:27:06.333,00:27:12.380,But recent studies show better than a 95% success rate with FMTs.
00:27:12.881,00:27:14.549,Howard is a good candidate.
00:27:14.632,00:27:17.052,We should try it before he develops a toxic megacolon.
00:27:25.518,00:27:27.604,You're right. Prep him for the procedure.
00:27:28.313,00:27:30.815,I appreciate your passionate advocacy for your patient.
00:27:30.899,00:27:32.400,"Good work, both of you."
00:27:35.987,00:27:38.823,"-Oh, now you're a team player. -When it benefits me, yes."
00:27:39.908,00:27:43.620,"Speaking of which, while you were doing your research, I found Howard a match at the stool bank."
00:27:43.703,00:27:45.663,-Sample arrives in a couple of hours. -Great.
00:27:45.747,00:27:50.293,I let them know you'd be the designated doctor to handle the medical chain of custody when the sample arrives.
00:27:51.252,00:27:52.170,So?
00:27:52.253,00:27:54.798,So you're the only person who can handle the sample.
00:27:54.881,00:27:57.425,"You'll have to dilute it, blend it, strain it all on your own."
00:27:57.509,00:27:59.427,"To safeguard against cross-contamination, of course."
00:28:00.428,00:28:01.513,Of course.
00:28:09.771,00:28:13.274,Your temperature and BP are normal.
00:28:13.358,00:28:15.276,"Normal, whatever that means."
00:28:15.735,00:28:18.154,Typical. Usual.
00:28:18.863,00:28:20.073,Expected.
00:28:20.448,00:28:22.367,"Yeah, I don't feel like any of those things."
00:28:23.410,00:28:25.620,What does it feel like to be a girl?
00:28:30.667,00:28:33.753,Are you angry? Was that an inflammatory question?
00:28:38.717,00:28:43.012,"When I used to look like a boy, I felt different."
00:28:48.351,00:28:49.853,I spent a lot of time alone.
00:28:52.063,00:28:58.611,"When my parents let me be me, I felt like I didn't have to pretend anymore."
00:29:00.822,00:29:05.076,"I felt free, like when you're in a pool and you just let go and float."
00:29:21.718,00:29:26.139,I don't know what it feels like to be anyone but me.
00:29:29.017,00:29:30.226,"Me, too."
00:29:32.395,00:29:37.150,Is the bilateral more risky than the unilateral surgery?
00:29:37.567,00:29:41.362,The big issue with the bilateral is Quinn will never be able to have biological children.
00:29:41.696,00:29:46.409,"If Quinn's parents think that Quinn's mature enough and strong enough in her beliefs, then they should do it now."
00:29:46.493,00:29:49.287,It's an elective surgery on a child.
00:29:49.370,00:29:50.830,There is no medical necessity.
00:29:50.914,00:29:53.958,"Except with a previous suicide attempt, she's still at risk."
00:29:54.042,00:29:55.502,Her situation is different now.
00:29:55.585,00:29:58.463,She's socially transitioned and living as a girl.
00:29:58.546,00:30:02.008,But there just isn't enough good data on trans kids and their outcomes.
00:30:02.091,00:30:06.513,"On the other hand, there's very good reason to preserve future fertility."
00:30:06.596,00:30:13.686,"Dr. Lim and Dr. Andrews are both very excellent surgeons, and they very clearly have some passionate points of view, but their views are their own."
00:30:13.770,00:30:16.981,You all need to decide what's best for Quinn.
00:30:18.608,00:30:22.403,"Whatever we decide, Quinn is still gonna be a girl."
00:30:25.824,00:30:27.992,I don't know if I'll ever be able to accept that.
00:30:29.619,00:30:31.788,I know that makes me sound horrible.
00:30:32.080,00:30:35.583,I know what it's like to not put your family first.
00:30:36.626,00:30:38.378,And it cost me.
00:30:39.170,00:30:41.172,It cost me a great deal.
00:30:42.006,00:30:54.519,"And if I had to do it all over again, I'd ask myself, Is it really worth sacrificing a life with someone I love over an idea that may never be?"
00:31:00.275,00:31:01.693,Why don't we give them the room?
00:31:10.285,00:31:12.370,Hey. I got the page. What's going on?
00:31:12.453,00:31:15.081,She started screaming in pain and vomiting. Temp's 104.
00:31:17.292,00:31:20.003,"epididymitis, kidney stones, inguinal hernia."
00:31:20.086,00:31:22.547,The extra weight of the tumor could be causing the testicle to twist on itself.
00:31:23.631,00:31:25.133,There'd be no blood flow.
00:31:31.931,00:31:34.267,She has a testicular torsion. She needs surgery now.
00:31:43.192,00:31:44.611,Excuse me. Have you made a decision?
00:31:45.028,00:31:48.239,"Not yet. I mean, there's a lot to work through… We need one now."
00:31:48.323,00:31:49.657,Quinn has testicular torsion.
00:31:50.283,00:31:53.119,The spermatic cord is twisted and cutting off blood supply.
00:31:53.202,00:31:54.287,We need to operate.
00:31:57.498,00:32:02.629,"If you want Quinn to live the way she wants, don't limit her future now."
00:32:05.381,00:32:08.217,You heard her when my mom said she might want kids someday.
00:32:08.593,00:32:12.013,She can't even fathom the thought because she's just a child.
00:32:18.102,00:32:19.854,Just do what's medically necessary.
00:32:28.905,00:32:31.741,Doesn't appear to be any palpable lymphadenopathy.
00:32:33.534,00:32:36.329,"It's likely a stromal tumor, but get that to pathology right away."
00:32:36.412,00:32:37.330,"Yes, sir."
00:32:42.126,00:32:44.629,Quinn has tachycardia and hypotension.
00:32:46.005,00:32:48.549,-I'm not seeing any bleeding. -EKG's normal. It's not coronary.
00:32:51.094,00:32:52.762,It must be a reaction to the anesthesia.
00:32:52.845,00:32:55.014,I'm already pushing fluids and vasoconstrictors.
00:33:03.272,00:33:06.234,"Six syringes in, and no sign of leakage."
00:33:06.317,00:33:07.527,"Okay, we're wrapped up here."
00:33:07.902,00:33:09.445,Let's get Howard into recovery.
00:33:09.529,00:33:10.947,-Well done. -Thanks.
00:33:11.614,00:33:15.660,"I was thinking of writing up the procedure, possibly submit it for publication?"
00:33:15.952,00:33:19.580,"I'd be happy to assist, seeing as I've done it before."
00:33:20.289,00:33:25.003,"Thanks, but I think I can… I read your paper in AMSURG, Dr. Reznick. You continue to impress."
00:33:25.837,00:33:27.588,"Coming from you, I take that as a huge compliment."
00:33:29.382,00:33:32.218,"When you get a chance, Dr. Browne, you should read it."
00:33:42.020,00:33:45.606,I've given vasopressors and reduced her meds as much as I can.
00:33:45.690,00:33:46.941,She's losing volume somewhere.
00:33:49.152,00:33:50.319,I'm still not seeing the bleed.
00:33:50.403,00:33:53.281,Could be vagal stimulation from the severed nerve.
00:33:55.533,00:33:56.659,It's too early for an infection.
00:33:58.786,00:34:00.705,Her MAP is 20. She's barely profusing.
00:34:00.788,00:34:01.789,All right.
00:34:04.083,00:34:05.334,"Okay, excuse me, guys."
00:34:05.418,00:34:07.003,-You're breaking scrub. -I'm so sorry.
00:34:09.881,00:34:11.174,Could be a retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
00:34:23.436,00:34:25.063,Jared could be right.
00:34:25.438,00:34:28.608,It is possible that there is internal bleeding.
00:34:29.067,00:34:32.737,The testicular artery can retract up into the pelvis.
00:34:32.820,00:34:34.822,"It's rare, but it can happen."
00:34:34.906,00:34:36.783,Rare is an understatement. Dr. Andrews?
00:34:39.952,00:34:43.039,I don't think we have any other choice. We need to do an ex-lap. 10 blade.
00:34:52.465,00:34:53.966,"Murphy, retract."
00:35:07.105,00:35:09.649,"-Nice call, Dr. Kalu. -Thank you, sir."
00:35:10.817,00:35:12.819,"Kalu, suction. We need a clear view of the field."
00:35:19.575,00:35:23.454,"Fever's down, and the flora in your system seems to be returning to normal."
00:35:23.538,00:35:27.458,-We expect a full recovery. -Thank you. For everything.
00:35:27.542,00:35:29.335,Do you know when I can have visitors?
00:35:29.418,00:35:31.295,I thought you might ask that question.
00:35:31.379,00:35:34.382,There are a couple of eager preschoolers who'd like to say hi.
00:35:34.841,00:35:38.010,-Oh. Keira! Sammy! -Daddy!
00:35:39.887,00:35:42.014,"Oh, I think you guys have grown."
00:35:43.516,00:35:46.018,"Hey. Hey, these are the doctors that saved Daddy."
00:35:46.394,00:35:51.274,"Dr. Reznick, and this is, uh, uh, uh… I'm sorry, I forgot your name."
00:35:54.068,00:35:55.570,-Thank you! -Thank you!
00:35:56.195,00:35:57.405,You're welcome.
00:36:02.034,00:36:03.035,Okay.
00:36:16.424,00:36:18.551,Did you do it? Did you remove both?
00:36:20.219,00:36:22.180,No. Just the cancerous one.
00:36:22.805,00:36:24.056,What? Why not?
00:36:26.058,00:36:26.976,That's on me.
00:36:27.059,00:36:28.936,"I couldn't, in good conscience, remove a healthy organ."
00:36:34.734,00:36:37.236,"Quinnie, this was our decision."
00:36:37.320,00:36:40.406,"-No! You said you were on my side. -Hey, we are."
00:36:40.823,00:36:41.866,Always.
00:36:41.949,00:36:47.705,"We haven't had enough time to talk, not with each other, with your therapist, with your doctors."
00:36:48.080,00:36:49.457,So I'm gonna turn into a boy?
00:36:49.874,00:36:51.292,Not right away.
00:36:51.709,00:36:56.088,Your endocrinologist will talk to you about the right timeline for starting feminizing hormones.
00:36:59.342,00:37:08.643,"You know… The thought of having your own kids someday is a big decision, but you never know what you will or will not want once you get older."
00:37:09.185,00:37:12.146,Cis people are always so worked up about having bio kids.
00:37:18.945,00:37:22.240,"You know, I'll be back when I'm 18 for my gender confirmation surgery."
00:37:23.366,00:37:26.202,"And when you do, I'll be here to help you."
00:37:34.085,00:37:37.588,"Patient satisfaction survey scores are in, and it was very close."
00:37:37.672,00:37:39.298,Not really. She's being kind.
00:37:40.633,00:37:43.469,Congratulations go to Dr. Reznick and Dr. Browne.
00:37:43.552,00:37:45.179,-Yes. -Thank you.
00:37:46.931,00:37:49.725,"-Congratulations. -Thank you, Shaun."
00:37:49.809,00:37:51.227,Claire and I make a nice team.
00:37:55.231,00:37:58.317,-You should be psyched. -Yeah. I should be.
00:38:01.028,00:38:04.782,To the victor belong the spoils. Pay up.
00:38:04.865,00:38:07.493,"Oh, humility was never your strong suit."
00:38:09.662,00:38:10.913,"Thank you, Mortimer."
00:38:18.838,00:38:21.590,What made you think of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage?
00:38:21.674,00:38:23.551,Homework. You were right.
00:38:23.634,00:38:25.469,Prepping for an SDA was important.
00:38:25.553,00:38:27.179,We make a good team.
00:38:30.349,00:38:32.518,Quinn doesn't like pink.
00:38:32.601,00:38:35.813,"-Oh… -Uh, I think she will like these."
00:38:37.148,00:38:38.232,I hope so.
00:38:41.027,00:38:43.529,She's more of a purple girl.
00:38:51.412,00:38:53.414,Did you read Morgan's AMSURG article yet?
00:38:57.126,00:38:59.253,I didn't tell you to read it to rub it in.
00:39:02.089,00:39:03.924,I told you to read it so you knew what you'd be up against.
00:39:04.008,00:39:05.843,You think I need to be more cutthroat?
00:39:06.385,00:39:08.804,No. That's Morgan's MO. You're different.
00:39:09.764,00:39:11.390,"You're smart, you're special."
00:39:12.266,00:39:14.685,"Rise up, play the game on your own terms."
00:39:15.728,00:39:16.812,Don't wait for it.
00:39:44.924,00:39:46.759,I heard you saved Quinn's life.
00:39:47.843,00:39:51.931,Jared and I did. I like her.
00:39:52.681,00:39:53.766,Her.
00:39:55.393,00:39:57.603,So you get that she is a she?
00:39:59.730,00:40:01.357,I have lots of questions.
00:40:01.440,00:40:03.651,"Yeah, well, questions are good."
00:40:04.402,00:40:06.946,Leads to awareness and understanding.
00:40:07.822,00:40:09.698,"And, who knows, maybe even acceptance."
00:40:11.700,00:40:13.828,"Being a kid is tough enough, but being a trans kid?"
00:40:13.911,00:40:16.747,"Oh, man, that's off the chart."
00:40:19.250,00:40:26.424,I can't imagine how it must feel to be so different on the outside than you are on the inside.
00:40:34.098,00:40:36.559,"Hey, Shaun. I can give you a lift."
00:40:36.642,00:40:39.145,Mm… We could grab a bite.
00:40:41.856,00:40:44.275,You said you can't be my friend.
00:40:45.359,00:40:46.777,"So, no, thank you."
00:40:52.491,00:40:53.576,Okay.
00:41:01.834,00:41:04.253,"-Hey, amigo. What's up? -I need your help."
00:41:50.633,00:41:52.551,You're not gonna do any laps or nothing?
00:41:53.469,00:41:54.386,No.
00:41:57.389,00:41:58.390,Then what are you doing?
00:42:01.185,00:42:02.686,Understanding.
00:00:12.638,00:00:39.874,and it's just fine MAN: Please walk around the other way.
00:00:45.629,00:00:47.464,What happened?
00:00:47.506,00:00:49.967,They're just getting the lobby ready for the big party.
00:00:52.386,00:00:54.388,CLAIRE: It's an annual fundraiser.
00:00:54.429,00:00:56.015,Like a carnival?
00:00:56.056,00:00:59.393,"No, it's a swanky, black-tie ball."
00:00:59.434,00:01:02.187,You think a hospital lobby is swanky?
00:01:05.858,00:01:09.361,It becomes a streamer and balloon-infested hospital lobby with a cash bar.
00:01:09.403,00:01:11.613,It's for charity.
00:01:11.655,00:01:13.532,Better to spend the money for the cause.
00:01:13.574,00:01:14.992,"Actually, it's worse."
00:01:16.911,00:01:18.579,I don't like parties.
00:01:18.620,00:01:21.415,Doesn't matter.
00:01:18.620,00:01:23.042,All residents will be expected to attend and make a donation.
00:01:23.083,00:01:24.167,This is Dr. Alex Park.
00:01:24.209,00:01:27.880,He's the last of Coyle's residents to be reassigned to our team.
00:01:27.922,00:01:31.550,"Meet doctors Jared Kalu, Claire Browne, and Shaun Murphy."
00:01:31.592,00:01:33.052,Nice to meet you.
00:01:33.092,00:01:35.470,Welcome back.
00:01:35.512,00:01:37.222,Beaches were awesome.
00:01:37.264,00:01:38.515,Little bastards stole my new camera and a pair of...
00:01:38.557,00:01:40.308,How old are you?
00:01:40.350,00:01:41.643,Forty-five.
00:01:41.685,00:01:44.521,That's even older than Dr. Melendez.
00:01:44.563,00:01:50.110,"DR. MELENDEZ: Dr. Murphy is a talented doctor who has autism, which sometimes causes him to ask inappropriate questions."
00:01:50.151,00:01:51.946,No worries.
00:01:51.987,00:01:53.488,I'm a late bloomer.
00:01:56.450,00:01:59.119,He was a cop for 15 years before he went to med school.
00:02:00.537,00:02:04.792,"DR. MELENDEZ: Now that we all know each other, Reznick and Browne have dibs on cases this week."
00:02:06.001,00:02:07.586,Yes.
00:02:07.628,00:02:09.797,Is there karaoke?
00:02:09.838,00:02:12.424,"And now, our all-star lineup!"
00:02:12.466,00:02:14.384,"Playing center, out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan."
00:02:16.386,00:02:18.639,"Spirit, stop it."
00:02:18.680,00:02:19.932,I'm not fooling around.
00:02:19.974,00:02:22.309,I need to document the momentous event.
00:02:22.350,00:02:23.435,Then at least get it right.
00:02:23.477,00:02:24.895,"I'm from Taipei, Taiwan."
00:02:24.937,00:02:26.897,SPIRIT: Co-o-orrection!
00:02:26.939,00:02:30.609,"From Taipei, Taiwan, which I believe is a suburb of Moose Jaw..."
00:02:33.946,00:02:39.534,And assisting Dr. Lim are two docs I've never met.
00:02:40.077,00:02:41.286,Hello.
00:02:44.623,00:02:46.625,SPIRIT: And...
00:02:46.667,00:02:49.377,"Dr. Morgan Reznick, Mill Valley, California."
00:02:49.419,00:02:50.504,Represent!
00:02:51.797,00:02:53.715,"Okay, Spirit, that's enough."
00:02:53.757,00:02:56.635,"All right, put your phone away, or it becomes my phone."
00:02:56.677,00:02:59.013,"Well, folks, looks like the suits are shuttin' me down."
00:02:59.054,00:03:00.263,Thanks for all your support.
00:03:00.305,00:03:03.391,Love you! Bye!
00:03:03.433,00:03:05.727,"Sorry, but my friends insist I keep them up to date."
00:03:05.769,00:03:07.437,It's all right.
00:03:10.024,00:03:12.693,Why didn't they repair it when she was an infant?
00:03:12.734,00:03:14.945,They couldn't.
00:03:14.987,00:03:18.115,But after 14 years of slow and steady growth...
00:03:18.157,00:03:20.159,It's time to put this baby where it belongs.
00:03:37.968,00:03:39.845,This is an interesting view.
00:03:42.014,00:03:43.849,DR. REZNICK: Murphy.
00:03:45.517,00:03:48.562,I'm sure you're looking forward to when there's nothing to be curious about.
00:03:52.733,00:03:54.860,You like crowds?
00:03:55.485,00:03:56.486,I don't know.
00:03:56.528,00:03:57.988,I've never been in one.
00:03:58.030,00:04:02.325,"I can't go to a normal school, and my parents barely ever let me leave our house."
00:04:02.367,00:04:04.870,"Well, when a small bump could stop your heart, it makes sense."
00:04:04.912,00:04:07.455,But you still have a lot of friends?
00:04:07.497,00:04:08.790,"Yeah, of course."
00:04:10.542,00:04:16.924,"If you can't do anything fun, then how did you get them to be your friend?"
00:04:16.965,00:04:19.593,"Well, in case you haven't noticed, I like to talk."
00:04:19.634,00:04:21.178,"Mm, yes."
00:04:21.220,00:04:23.889,We all do everything online now anyway.
00:04:23.931,00:04:27.642,The first thing I'm gonna do when I get out of here is take all my friends to a concert.
00:04:27.684,00:04:29.603,"Like, general admission, on the floor."
00:04:29.644,00:04:32.480,"I don't even care who the band is, just as long as the place is packed."
00:04:32.522,00:04:34.315,"Oh, and I'm gonna hug everyone."
00:04:34.357,00:04:35.817,You've never hugged anyone?
00:04:35.859,00:04:37.027,Not even your parents?
00:04:37.069,00:04:41.907,"Kissed by my parents, high-fived by my friends, but, nope, no hugs."
00:04:41.949,00:04:43.408,It's just too risky.
00:04:44.659,00:04:47.788,Hugs make me feel trapped.
00:04:49.456,00:04:50.832,Agh!
00:04:50.874,00:04:52.375,Almost done.
00:04:52.417,00:04:54.044,Pain in the upper-right quadrant.
00:04:54.086,00:04:55.587,It's jaundice.
00:04:55.629,00:04:57.422,Bilirubin's off the chart.
00:04:57.464,00:05:00.508,That doesn't make sense.
00:05:02.469,00:05:04.387,"Well, it could just be a temporary flare-up."
00:05:04.429,00:05:06.974,We'll increase his anti-rejection meds and do a full liver exam.
00:05:07.015,00:05:08.225,We'll know more then.
00:05:17.067,00:05:18.193,"You two, do the work-up."
00:05:18.235,00:05:19.820,And you find a new liver.
00:05:19.861,00:05:21.362,Shouldn't we wait for the biopsy result?
00:05:21.404,00:05:23.073,Not when I already know what it's gonna say.
00:05:23.115,00:05:25.659,He needs a new liver ASAP.
00:05:25.700,00:05:27.161,"I mean, that's gonna be hard."
00:05:28.411,00:05:29.746,It's gonna be impossible.
00:05:29.788,00:05:31.372,He's lucky they were able to find the first one.
00:05:36.377,00:05:38.421,DR. LIM: We're screwed.
00:05:38.463,00:05:45.679,"Barbara Boxer got ear barotrauma scuba-diving in Cozumel and cannot fly for two weeks, which means we don't have a keynote speaker for our gala."
00:05:46.930,00:05:48.182,You think this is funny?
00:05:48.223,00:05:54.562,"I've just never seen you anxious, and I seriously doubt Barbara Boxer scuba-dives."
00:05:54.604,00:05:56.023,It's just an excuse.
00:05:56.064,00:05:57.065,She sent me a picture from the hospital.
00:05:57.107,00:05:58.483,"Oh, really?"
00:05:58.525,00:05:59.860,Anyone can fake a photograph.
00:05:59.901,00:06:00.902,What are you doing?
00:06:00.944,00:06:09.995,"I am doing a search to see if our esteemed senator from the great state of California ever once, once talked about scuba-diving in an interview."
00:06:10.037,00:06:11.330,It doesn't matter if it's true.
00:06:11.370,00:06:13.790,What matters is that we find a replacement.
00:06:13.832,00:06:15.709,I need you to get me a meeting with Aiden Coulter.
00:06:15.750,00:06:17.252,"Oh, Aiden Coulter?"
00:06:17.294,00:06:19.713,Oh. What?
00:06:21.173,00:06:29.556,"And the story I remember is that you two were talking smack that entire game, and after he spilled his beer on you and insisted on buying you a new jacket, you refused him."
00:06:29.597,00:06:31.350,So he owes you.
00:06:31.390,00:06:33.560,Just get me a meeting.
00:06:34.895,00:06:36.395,Okay.
00:06:36.437,00:06:38.190,I'll see what I can do.
00:06:38.232,00:06:39.566,You're welcome.
00:06:48.325,00:06:49.450,Huh.
00:06:52.371,00:06:54.039,You've had liver biopsies before.
00:06:54.081,00:06:56.541,And they've always hurt a lot.
00:06:56.583,00:06:58.710,"Please, isn't there another way?"
00:06:58.752,00:07:02.381,"Well, the other way, Eric, would going through your neck, and I don't think you'd like that anymore."
00:07:02.421,00:07:06.176,"Eric, do you know why NBA players all wear headphones before games?"
00:07:06.218,00:07:07.928,Don't look at him.
00:07:07.969,00:07:09.554,I need you to answer me.
00:07:09.596,00:07:11.890,Why do NBA players wear headphones before games?
00:07:11.932,00:07:13.767,I don't know.
00:07:13.808,00:07:15.310,I guess they like music.
00:07:15.352,00:07:17.062,"No, they need music."
00:07:17.104,00:07:20.690,Music helps them forget about everything else and focus on what's important...
00:07:22.901,00:07:24.069,Who's your favorite player?
00:07:25.695,00:07:26.988,Okay.
00:07:27.030,00:07:30.242,This is the song he listens to before every game.
00:07:34.829,00:07:38.792,I want you to close your eyes and focus on this.
00:07:42.462,00:07:43.546,It's cold.
00:07:43.588,00:07:48.551,"Yeah, now it is, but if you stay focused, pretty soon, it'll stop feeling cold and start to feel warm."
00:07:48.593,00:07:53.765,"When that happens, I want you to nod your head, and you'll feel some pressure and a small pinch."
00:07:53.807,00:07:55.142,What if it does...
00:07:55.183,00:07:57.477,Then close your eyes and focus.
00:08:02.857,00:08:04.484,You ready?
00:08:17.414,00:08:19.540,Two minutes and he'll be good to go.
00:08:19.582,00:08:21.293,How'd you know he was a basketball fan?
00:08:22.043,00:08:24.045,His shoes.
00:08:24.087,00:08:25.546,He's not wearing any shoes.
00:08:25.588,00:08:27.090,"Yeah, they're in a backpack in his room."
00:08:30.427,00:08:35.515,"Well, it's, um, less invasive than a rectal, and most of the time more useful."
00:08:38.559,00:08:41.021,"Okay, Spirit, just keep still and..."
00:08:41.062,00:08:45.900,"And during a few parts of the exam, we may ask you to hold your breath, but it'll only be a few seconds."
00:08:45.942,00:08:47.861,You got it.
00:08:50.780,00:08:52.740,You gonna buy a tux or rent one?
00:08:54.242,00:08:55.952,The fundraiser is black tie.
00:08:55.994,00:08:57.412,I have a suit.
00:08:57.454,00:08:58.872,It's new.
00:08:58.913,00:09:01.541,I bought it for my resident interviews.
00:09:01.582,00:09:03.335,It doesn't matter how new it is.
00:09:03.377,00:09:05.920,It's not a tux.
00:09:05.962,00:09:08.965,Wearing a uniform at work reassures patients.
00:09:09.007,00:09:13.387,Wearing a uniform at a party does nothing but make you hot and uncomfortable.
00:09:13.428,00:09:15.389,This party is work.
00:09:15.430,00:09:16.723,Get a tux.
00:09:18.892,00:09:21.353,Get fitted by a pro and spend a minimum of two grand.
00:09:21.395,00:09:24.772,"You're gonna meet rich people who can help your career, and they're not gonna want to help some slob in a..."
00:09:24.814,00:09:26.525,I'm not a slob.
00:09:30.487,00:09:32.239,And it's too big.
00:09:33.948,00:09:35.450,Her heart.
00:09:40.621,00:09:42.416,Her last exam was only six months ago.
00:09:42.457,00:09:44.376,It won't fit.
00:09:45.210,00:09:46.669,Too big.
00:09:46.711,00:09:49.047,The biopsy confirmed acute cellular rejection.
00:09:49.089,00:09:50.965,"We maximized his immuno-suppressives, but, uh..."
00:09:53.301,00:09:55.011,Are you sure?
00:09:55.053,00:09:56.971,"Park and I checked the registry, and there weren't any."
00:09:57.013,00:09:58.598,I found it online.
00:09:58.639,00:10:00.267,"He, uh..."
00:09:58.639,00:10:03.186,"He already tried to make a direct donation a few months ago, but the patient died before the surgery."
00:10:03.228,00:10:08.108,"I contacted him, which wasn't easy, but he still wants to be a donor."
00:10:08.149,00:10:09.484,That's amazing.
00:10:09.526,00:10:10.610,Great job.
00:10:11.361,00:10:12.987,What's the catch?
00:10:13.029,00:10:14.614,"He wants to be a donor, but he's not on the registry?"
00:10:14.655,00:10:16.991,"I mean, there's got to be a catch."
00:10:17.033,00:10:21.829,"He, uh... He can't be on the registry because he is in prison."
00:10:23.039,00:10:24.416,For murder.
00:10:33.425,00:10:37.637,Boris Tirayan was a Russian Mafia enforcer convicted of seven murders.
00:10:37.678,00:10:39.514,Who now wants to make amends.
00:10:39.556,00:10:43.935,"He tried to be a donor a few months ago, but the patient died before the red tape could be worked out."
00:10:43.977,00:10:45.812,But now that it has...
00:10:45.853,00:10:48.648,Are there any laws against an inmate becoming a donor?
00:10:48.689,00:10:51.067,"No, but there is a ton of liability."
00:10:51.109,00:10:52.444,What if he attacks someone here?
00:10:52.486,00:10:56.906,"He'll be guarded by state prison guards on a separate level, away from patients and all non-essential staff."
00:10:59.200,00:11:01.911,"The guy wants to do something decent, we should let him."
00:11:01.953,00:11:04.289,I don't think we owe a murderer anything.
00:11:04.331,00:11:07.250,But maybe he owes us something.
00:11:07.292,00:11:10.837,Which he would repay by donating his inner organs.
00:11:10.878,00:11:16.843,Isn't it a slippery slope between a guy who wants to make amends and turning our prison system into a superstore for body parts?
00:11:16.884,00:11:20.096,A slippery slope that saves a child's life.
00:11:20.138,00:11:22.474,It'll never happen.
00:11:20.138,00:11:23.850,"He's just trying to get a hospital, where it'll be easier to escape."
00:11:23.891,00:11:26.186,You have no idea what his motivation is.
00:11:29.606,00:11:31.732,He's been a model inmate for nine years.
00:11:31.774,00:11:33.610,Tutors other prisoners in the library...
00:11:33.652,00:11:37.071,"Yeah, because he's trying to get someone to trust him, to give him an inch, and as soon as they do..."
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.533,We got approval.
00:11:39.574,00:11:43.036,"He's gonna stall, make excuses, and when he sees his chance, someone's gonna get hurt."
00:11:43.077,00:11:45.622,I think it's worth taking that chance.
00:11:45.664,00:11:48.749,"Anybody who doesn't agree, feel free to sit this one out."
00:11:52.837,00:12:01.680,"DR. REZNICK: When you started menstruating, the increased estrogen caused pulmonary hypertension, which isn't a surgical issue in itself, but along with your atypical vascular system..."
00:12:04.558,00:12:10.980,"DR. LIM: We will control your blood pressure so that you will keep growing but your heart won't, and then, by the time you're 18, we'll able to..."
00:12:11.022,00:12:12.023,No.
00:12:12.065,00:12:13.858,I'm not waiting any longer.
00:12:13.900,00:12:15.193,"Spirit, honey, it will be okay."
00:12:15.235,00:12:16.819,"No, it won't!"
00:12:16.861,00:12:18.946,I'm sick of being stuck inside all the time.
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.575,I'm sick of this!
00:12:23.326,00:12:26.705,"I don't ever want to text, call, or video chat again."
00:12:26.745,00:12:28.623,"Mom, I want to be touched."
00:12:30.875,00:12:32.335,I want to be shoved.
00:12:33.794,00:12:36.423,I want to be punched.
00:12:36.464,00:12:37.632,Please.
00:12:40.009,00:12:41.386,Please.
00:12:42.679,00:12:44.514,I want this surgery now.
00:12:51.145,00:12:52.313,I need it.
00:12:54.649,00:12:57.318,I'm sorry.
00:13:04.451,00:13:06.745,We need to get rid of all the furniture and artwork.
00:13:06.785,00:13:09.456,"I get removing the paintings, but the furniture?"
00:13:09.497,00:13:11.874,Don't want the prison guards sitting down on the job.
00:13:11.916,00:13:15.002,"He's gonna be in full restraints, cuffed to the bed."
00:13:15.044,00:13:19.716,"Well, that's our plan, but we also need to be prepared for his plan."
00:13:19.758,00:13:25.639,"Okay, we need to get rid of the window blinds, curtain rods, jacket hooks, and make sure there's no metal rivets or eyelets on the mattress."
00:13:25.680,00:13:27.724,"Um, what's he gonna do with a metal eyelet?"
00:13:27.766,00:13:36.566,"Tear it off the mattress and file it down to cut your jugular, or bend it into a handcuff key, or shove it into an electric socket to create a spark and start a fire."
00:13:56.544,00:13:59.880,"So, I've been thinking."
00:13:59.922,00:14:01.591,You want to go to the fundraiser together?
00:14:01.633,00:14:04.093,It's not a prom.
00:14:04.135,00:14:06.513,"Yeah, we don't have to."
00:14:06.554,00:14:10.057,"But we can, if we want."
00:14:13.520,00:14:18.857,I think it might be a nice opportunity to take our relationship out into the open.
00:14:20.318,00:14:22.487,Unless you don't want to.
00:14:22.529,00:14:25.239,"No, it's a good idea."
00:14:25.281,00:14:26.324,Are you sure?
00:14:26.366,00:14:27.742,"Because, you know, we don't have to."
00:14:27.784,00:14:30.036,Yeah.
00:14:35.916,00:14:37.418,Let's go.
00:14:38.670,00:14:40.213,What's wrong?
00:14:41.922,00:14:43.299,"No, I won't. I don't want a murderer's liver!"
00:14:43.341,00:14:44.884,It's evil!
00:14:44.925,00:14:47.846,there's no such thing as a good or bad liver.
00:14:47.887,00:14:50.097,It's just a...
00:14:50.139,00:14:52.099,"CLAIRE: Eric, this is your only choice."
00:14:52.141,00:14:55.186,"If we don't do the transplant, you will die."
00:14:55.228,00:14:58.981,"ERIC: I don't want him to be a part of me, inside me forever, all right?"
00:15:07.532,00:15:09.325,That's ridiculous.
00:15:09.367,00:15:11.536,Personality traits aren't transferred in an organ transplant.
00:15:11.578,00:15:12.746,It's also irrelevant.
00:15:12.787,00:15:15.707,"Children don't consent to surgeries, their parents do."
00:15:15.749,00:15:20.086,"But if he doesn't cooperate with the anti-rejection regimen, we could be wasting a liver that could save someone else's life."
00:15:20.127,00:15:21.546,DR. PARK: No one's getting saved by Tirayan.
00:15:25.425,00:15:27.594,There's no way it can tolerate an incompatible blood type.
00:15:27.635,00:15:31.222,"CLAIRE: No, the only way to save Eric is to do the transplant with Tirayan's liver."
00:15:31.264,00:15:32.306,That is it.
00:15:32.348,00:15:34.016,We have no other option.
00:15:37.311,00:15:39.980,Let the O.R. know we're gonna need more restraints.
00:15:41.858,00:15:46.654,Dr. Clinton Ford out of Alberta developed an experimental resorbable material.
00:15:46.696,00:15:50.784,It would allow us to expand her rib cage and create room to fit her heart inside.
00:15:52.452,00:15:54.829,DR. REZNICK: That would actually grow along with the patient.
00:15:54.871,00:15:57.540,The surgery isn't reversible.
00:15:57.582,00:16:01.711,"If it doesn't work, we can't just move her heart back to where it was."
00:16:01.753,00:16:03.296,It would allow her to have a life.
00:16:10.762,00:16:18.269,"I get you're autistic, but I know even you realize when a patient cries and throws her phone against the wall, they're not happy with their current health."
00:16:18.311,00:16:20.229,There's no reason to make this personal.
00:16:20.271,00:16:22.022,DR. REZNICK: There is if his medical judgment is biased.
00:16:22.064,00:16:25.151,I saw she was upset.
00:16:25.192,00:16:28.446,"You saw it, but you didn't understand it."
00:16:31.282,00:16:37.497,"Are you trying to make Dr. Lim think I'm biased, or are you trying to undermine my confidence?"
00:16:37.538,00:16:39.833,I'm actually trying to help you and the patient.
00:16:39.874,00:16:44.420,"She wants to be able to rub elbows, and you need to learn how to trade elbows."
00:16:44.462,00:16:48.883,DR. LIM: The resorbable plate is experimental and risky.
00:16:48.925,00:16:52.887,But my medical judgment is that it's worth it.
00:16:54.305,00:16:56.390,Make sure she agrees and then get her prepped.
00:17:02.021,00:17:03.898,Why me?
00:17:03.940,00:17:11.322,"I'm not famous, I don't know anything about medicine, and giving the keynote speech at your fundraiser is a steep price to pay for a beer-stained jacket."
00:17:15.702,00:17:18.120,You grew up in San Jose.
00:17:18.162,00:17:28.255,"You went to San Jose State despite being accepted by both Princeton and MIT, and you headquartered your company here, despite huge tax breaks offered by Chicago and Minneapolis."
00:17:28.297,00:17:29.841,And it was his favorite jacket.
00:17:29.883,00:17:33.260,"Well, when I offered to have it cleaned, he said not to bother because he didn't even like the jacket."
00:17:33.302,00:17:35.429,He was being polite.
00:17:35.471,00:17:37.056,I take it you've never been to a game with him.
00:17:39.099,00:17:42.020,"You did some homework, but not enough."
00:17:42.061,00:17:43.688,"I love this city, but I have giving speeches."
00:17:43.730,00:17:46.148,So don't give a speech.
00:17:46.190,00:17:48.192,Tell us a story.
00:17:48.234,00:17:51.237,Like the one you told at the wrap party at the Youth Dance company's fall musical.
00:17:51.278,00:17:53.072,The one where you got lost at the Paris catacombs.
00:17:56.075,00:17:57.117,I stand corrected.
00:17:57.159,00:18:02.916,"Your success is inspiring, Aiden, as well as your loyalty to this city."
00:18:02.957,00:18:05.459,"And the fact that you're young, apparently very funny..."
00:18:05.501,00:18:07.795,I'm in.
00:18:11.549,00:18:14.134,But I was curious what your attack strategy would be.
00:18:14.176,00:18:15.678,"So, how was it?"
00:18:50.588,00:18:54.634,He's been a model inmate for nine years and tutors the other prisoners in the library.
00:19:07.688,00:19:09.607,Coke nail come in handy up at Pelican Bay?
00:19:09.649,00:19:10.900,I make jewelry.
00:19:10.942,00:19:13.402,Helps me pick up the beads.
00:19:13.444,00:19:16.405,Is there a history of cancer or liver disease in your family?
00:19:16.447,00:19:17.907,I went through this a couple of months ago.
00:19:17.949,00:19:19.867,You have my file.
00:19:19.909,00:19:21.786,We need to do our own exam.
00:19:21.828,00:19:23.746,CLAIRE: And there's nothing about your family in previous records.
00:19:23.788,00:19:24.747,Are they still alive?
00:19:24.789,00:19:26.332,They're dead to me.
00:19:26.373,00:19:28.208,"Quit stalling, or we'll send you back right now."
00:19:31.545,00:19:34.882,I haven't spoken to anyone in my family since I was 15 years old.
00:19:34.924,00:19:40.554,"Last I know, uh, both my parents were healthy enough to kick the crap out of me on a daily basis."
00:19:43.808,00:19:45.434,Why do you want to do this?
00:19:45.476,00:19:48.146,"Maybe I just like, uh, cute nurses and bad Jell-o."
00:19:48.187,00:19:50.314,Why do you care?
00:19:50.356,00:19:52.191,As long as you do what you're told.
00:19:52.817,00:19:54.944,Don't worry.
00:19:54.986,00:19:57.196,I'm very good at following orders.
00:20:05.245,00:20:09.042,Councilman Burns must be very happy with his facelift.
00:20:09.083,00:20:10.835,He just bought another table for the fundraiser.
00:20:10.877,00:20:13.671,"I aim to please, but you already knew that."
00:20:13.713,00:20:15.631,"And I need to get into surgery, so stop being so coy."
00:20:15.673,00:20:17.091,What's up?
00:20:19.010,00:20:24.306,"You and Isabel always seem very happy, able to manage both your professional and personal lives."
00:20:24.348,00:20:28.310,"I'm flattered you think so, but still a bit coy."
00:20:31.689,00:20:34.067,"Okay, so now we're getting somewhere."
00:20:34.108,00:20:36.861,Surgery can wait a few minutes.
00:20:36.903,00:20:41.032,Is it unprofessional of me to explore it?
00:20:41.074,00:20:47.038,"He's not a hospital employee, but potentially a significant donor and younger."
00:20:47.080,00:20:48.081,Quite a bit.
00:20:48.122,00:20:49.289,Mm-hmm.
00:20:51.500,00:20:54.545,"I don't know, maybe I'm just imagining something that doesn't even exist."
00:20:54.587,00:20:55.755,"Oh, I doubt that."
00:20:55.796,00:20:57.631,"You're an attractive, smart, interesting woman."
00:21:01.010,00:21:02.261,But you can't date a donor like Coulter.
00:21:02.595,00:21:04.638,Sorry.
00:21:04.680,00:21:06.473,There's no actual policy against it.
00:21:06.515,00:21:09.393,"I'm not talking policy, I'm talking optics."
00:21:09.435,00:21:13.647,The last thing you want is someone thinking you'd use sex to get a big donation.
00:21:14.982,00:21:19.528,"It's a double standard, I know, but it's the world we live in."
00:21:19.570,00:21:21.655,I said no!
00:21:23.449,00:21:25.118,I thought you gave him something to calm him.
00:21:26.619,00:21:28.746,I'm gonna start him on IV midazolam now.
00:21:28.788,00:21:31.916,"Eric. Eric, remember what Dr. Park said earlier about focusing?"
00:21:31.958,00:21:33.918,I know you can do that.
00:21:33.960,00:21:35.169,How about we get those earbuds you had earlier?
00:21:37.713,00:21:39.506,Look at me!
00:21:39.548,00:21:41.300,Do not move.
00:21:57.233,00:21:59.819,SHAUN: You wear very stylish clothes.
00:22:00.736,00:22:02.238,"Um, thank you."
00:22:02.280,00:22:04.490,I assume you mean when I'm not in surgery.
00:22:04.531,00:22:08.911,Yes. Do you think people believe you're a better doctor because of that?
00:22:10.579,00:22:12.123,Some people.
00:22:12.165,00:22:15.375,"Others probably just think I'm a show-off or arrogant, gay."
00:22:15.417,00:22:18.129,I don't care.
00:22:18.171,00:22:19.297,"You look good, you feel good."
00:22:19.338,00:22:21.340,Does it help you make friends?
00:22:23.509,00:22:26.220,Feeling good about yourself helps with everything.
00:22:30.891,00:22:33.269,"I can pay $2,000."
00:22:33.602,00:22:34.812,Okay.
00:22:34.854,00:22:43.403,"Dr. Reznick says if I want people who matter to help my career, I need to wear a tuxedo that costs $2,000 to the fundraiser."
00:22:45.363,00:22:48.242,No. I make my own decisions now.
00:22:50.661,00:22:57.210,"Murphy, people who matter will help your career because they're impressed with your talent and potential as a surgeon."
00:22:57.251,00:23:01.672,"And I could send you to my tailor, where you'll definitely spend two grand."
00:23:01.714,00:23:03.757,But my advice would be just rent one.
00:23:03.799,00:23:07.385,"Make sure you get fitted by the manager, and for a couple-hundred bucks, you'll be fine."
00:23:15.519,00:23:18.272,I'm gonna need you to count backwards from 10.
00:23:19.773,00:23:24.402,"10, 9, 8..."
00:23:28.490,00:23:31.369,DR. MELENDEZ: Looks like you were wrong.
00:23:38.209,00:23:40.127,"CLAIRE: His eyes, they're swelling up."
00:23:44.882,00:23:46.842,So is his tongue.
00:23:46.884,00:23:48.177,Stop the anesthesia.
00:23:48.219,00:23:50.346,Give me 0.5 MGs epinephrine I.M. now.
00:23:50.388,00:23:51.471,I'm on it.
00:23:52.973,00:23:54.767,Epi's in.
00:23:54.808,00:23:57.270,We need to intubate.
00:23:57.311,00:23:58.771,Now!
00:24:13.411,00:24:16.705,You had a severe allergic reaction to the anesthesia.
00:24:16.747,00:24:19.625,We had to intubate you and give you steroids.
00:24:24.671,00:24:26.464,You didn't do it?
00:24:26.506,00:24:29.135,We can't operate on you if you can't breathe under anesthesia.
00:24:30.844,00:24:32.638,CLAIRE: You did everything you could.
00:24:32.679,00:24:36.100,The patient's parents wanted you to know they're extremely grateful for everything you did.
00:24:36.142,00:24:38.102,Or tried to do.
00:24:40.020,00:24:42.022,You can try again.
00:24:42.064,00:24:43.732,"I'm sorry, we can't."
00:24:46.193,00:24:48.154,"No, you try again."
00:24:49.822,00:24:51.449,Okay?
00:24:52.908,00:24:54.492,You try again.
00:24:55.202,00:24:56.620,Try again!
00:24:56.662,00:24:57.913,Try again!
00:24:57.955,00:25:00.833,PRISON GUARD: Calm down!
00:25:00.874,00:25:02.126,PRISON GUARD 2: He said calm down! Now!
00:25:19.726,00:25:22.520,That's the way it's always been for me.
00:25:25.065,00:25:27.734,Nothing I ever...
00:25:38.704,00:25:43.917,"He's still on the top of the UNOS list, and we're gonna be calling and rechecking every registry and database all night."
00:25:46.128,00:25:47.421,How long do we have?
00:25:48.755,00:25:51.467,"Without a new liver, maybe a day."
00:25:56.722,00:25:59.766,"DR. REZNICK: So, what'd you get?"
00:25:59.808,00:26:02.769,SHAUN: Dr. Andrews said I should just rent one.
00:26:02.811,00:26:04.397,DR. REZNICK: And you're gonna listen to him?
00:26:04.438,00:26:08.150,SHAUN: He's the Chief of Surgery.
00:26:08.192,00:26:13.447,"DR. REZNICK: If Andrews had a son, you think he'd let him go to an important event in a cheap rental tux?"
00:26:13.489,00:26:18.369,SHAUN: He said people who matter judge people based on their talent.
00:26:18.411,00:26:21.080,"DR. REZNICK: Yeah, that's what he tells someone else's kid."
00:26:21.121,00:26:23.832,"To his own, or someone he actually respects, he tells the truth."
00:26:25.000,00:26:26.377,Cut here.
00:26:33.259,00:26:37.430,SHAUN: Do you respect me?
00:26:37.471,00:26:42.393,"DR. REZNICK: You're smart, able to memorize a ton of information, but..."
00:26:42.435,00:26:44.811,"No, not really."
00:26:46.604,00:26:48.190,Suction the mediastinum.
00:26:53.820,00:26:57.991,You've certainly put a lot of thought into what someone you claim not to respect wears to a party.
00:27:01.078,00:27:05.082,Everyone's uncomfortable in fancy clothes and hates kissing up to bigwigs at a fundraiser.
00:27:05.124,00:27:07.501,But they do it. They don't cower at home alone.
00:27:07.543,00:27:09.878,You use your autism as a crutch.
00:27:09.920,00:27:12.298,"Okay, I think if you liked him anymore, he'd have a black eye."
00:27:16.135,00:27:18.971,Make sure we're clear on that side and the aorta isn't kinked.
00:27:23.267,00:27:25.060,SHAUN: The aorta isn't kinked.
00:27:25.102,00:27:27.480,Good. Now for the moment of truth.
00:27:30.274,00:27:31.275,Position the plate.
00:27:38.491,00:27:39.657,Perfect fit.
00:27:47.583,00:27:50.252,What the hell?
00:27:54.131,00:27:55.924,"No, don't touch him."
00:27:55.966,00:27:57.426,If he can't control his bladder...
00:27:57.468,00:27:59.094,He can control himself just fine.
00:28:01.096,00:28:02.306,Stand up.
00:28:02.348,00:28:04.224,Re-check his cuffs first.
00:28:04.266,00:28:06.519,"You're getting changed, and we're going."
00:28:06.560,00:28:07.978,DR. PARK: Just take him like he is.
00:28:08.020,00:28:11.773,I'm not gonna get stuck in the van for the next three hours with him like that.
00:28:11.815,00:28:14.026,Watch his hands!
00:28:15.528,00:28:18.280,Put the gun down now!
00:28:18.322,00:28:19.573,"You shoot me, he dies."
00:28:19.615,00:28:21.241,"Now, no one is shooting anyone."
00:28:21.283,00:28:22.784,Everyone stay calm.
00:28:22.826,00:28:24.453,Give him space.
00:28:24.495,00:28:26.121,"You did something good, Boris."
00:28:26.163,00:28:27.373,Don't ruin it now.
00:28:28.123,00:28:29.916,"I did nothing, yeah?"
00:28:31.418,00:28:34.129,I accomplished nothing!
00:28:34.171,00:28:37.090,Whatever happens next is completely in your control.
00:28:39.759,00:28:42.095,"You have power, but it's not unlimited."
00:28:42.137,00:28:45.474,"You're not gonna escape, you're not just walking out of here."
00:28:45.516,00:28:49.687,"But there are things, concessions, that could make your life better."
00:28:49.728,00:28:53.106,So let's just take our time and talk.
00:28:53.773,00:28:55.526,There's no rush.
00:28:55.568,00:28:58.195,"What do you want, Boris?"
00:28:58.237,00:29:00.739,What do you really want?
00:29:02.782,00:29:04.951,I don't want anyone to help me.
00:29:08.455,00:29:10.916,I... No.
00:29:15.629,00:29:17.756,Do not do it.
00:29:20.133,00:29:21.760,Don't listen to her.
00:29:24.054,00:29:25.180,Yeah.
00:29:26.098,00:29:27.099,"Boris, no!"
00:29:39.778,00:29:41.780,Let's go! Let's go!
00:29:43.823,00:29:45.576,Melendez is en route.
00:29:49.747,00:29:53.125,"All right, ready?"
00:29:53.166,00:29:54.585,Page urology and cardio-thoracicstat.
00:29:55.877,00:29:57.129,He's dead and he has a donor card.
00:29:57.170,00:29:58.797,We're gonna take everything he can donate.
00:30:05.763,00:30:24.239,"was hard to maintain, so we broke it that I cannot lose all of you laugh about being crazy?"
00:30:25.365,00:30:26.908,Thank you so much.
00:30:26.950,00:30:28.243,Your speech was perfect.
00:30:28.285,00:30:29.453,And hilarious.
00:30:29.495,00:30:31.330,"Oh, you're very welcome."
00:30:31.371,00:30:33.499,And I appreciate the opportunity to help change my rep.
00:30:33.540,00:30:35.375,You have a rep?
00:30:35.417,00:30:37.294,All work and no play.
00:30:40.380,00:30:42.966,Your rep or your lifestyle?
00:30:43.008,00:30:44.884,I need less stress and more fun.
00:30:49.889,00:30:52.434,Would you like to play golf sometime?
00:30:53.644,00:30:56.855,On a real course with actual grass.
00:30:59.316,00:31:00.651,Absolutely.
00:31:02.736,00:31:04.404,Would you like to dance?
00:31:04.446,00:31:05.614,I'd love to.
00:31:05.656,00:31:07.157,"All right, let's go."
00:31:12.954,00:31:15.666,We need to get Eric prepped right away.
00:31:15.708,00:31:17.917,What's happening?
00:31:17.959,00:31:20.295,"Actually, it's, it's the same one."
00:31:21.714,00:31:23.131,The circumstances have changed.
00:31:24.007,00:31:26.134,This is incredible.
00:31:26.176,00:31:27.636,"No, I don't want it."
00:31:27.678,00:31:41.900,"Eric, when the donor found out that he couldn't do the surgery to help you, he became incredibly sad because he wanted you to live more than he wanted to live."
00:31:44.277,00:31:48.782,He ended his life so that you could have his liver.
00:31:49.949,00:31:59.292,"He... He knew he'd done some bad things, and I think that this was the only way he knew how to make amends."
00:32:01.378,00:32:03.797,I think we should try and help him.
00:32:05.215,00:32:07.676,Do you think you can do that?
00:32:07.718,00:32:10.554,Help someone do something good?
00:32:19.938,00:32:21.106,Yeah.
00:32:24.902,00:32:26.820,Everything looks good.
00:32:36.538,00:32:37.831,I...
00:32:38.707,00:32:39.958,"What, honey?"
00:32:41.042,00:32:42.795,I want a hug.
00:33:16.161,00:33:17.996,You look like a million bucks.
00:33:18.705,00:33:23.836,"No, it cost $2,368."
00:33:23.877,00:33:25.462,"Well, it was worth every penny."
00:33:25.504,00:33:27.172,Good investment.
00:33:27.213,00:33:28.632,Glad to see you're treating yourself.
00:33:28.674,00:33:29.925,You deserve it.
00:33:29.967,00:33:31.885,How much did you dress cost?
00:33:34.513,00:33:36.640,I don't remember.
00:33:36.682,00:33:40.310,"And just so you know, that's not the best question for an event like this."
00:33:40.352,00:33:42.521,Why not?
00:33:44.481,00:33:47.025,I don't know.
00:33:47.943,00:33:49.027,Okay.
00:33:50.696,00:33:52.113,Can I buy you a drink?
00:33:52.155,00:33:53.699,I don't like tequila anymore.
00:33:53.740,00:33:55.283,It makes me vomit.
00:33:55.325,00:33:58.537,"Well, okay."
00:34:00.747,00:34:02.958,"No, thank you."
00:34:03.000,00:34:10.716,"Uh, that's a partner at a firm that did some pro bono work for us last month, so I have to go thank him."
00:34:10.757,00:34:12.801,Okay. Bye.
00:34:20.225,00:34:21.518,Hello.
00:34:21.560,00:34:22.895,Hello.
00:34:34.865,00:34:37.075,There you are.
00:34:37.116,00:34:39.285,And nicely done.
00:34:39.327,00:34:40.537,You got the look.
00:34:40.579,00:34:41.872,Now you got to put it to use.
00:34:43.456,00:34:44.583,Mingle.
00:34:45.625,00:34:46.752,Okay.
00:34:48.336,00:34:51.172,"I see you, Dr. Chen."
00:34:51.214,00:34:54.133,She runs the Rivington Fellowship at the Mayo Clinic.
00:34:54.175,00:34:56.344,I wonder who brought her here.
00:34:59.639,00:35:01.099,Mingle.
00:35:02.267,00:35:04.603,You still think people can't change?
00:35:05.520,00:35:06.813,He didn't.
00:35:09.190,00:35:12.235,He's an assassin who murdered people for money.
00:35:12.277,00:35:14.988,Today was just one more cold-blooded killing.
00:35:15.030,00:35:20.118,You helped him sacrifice his life so that he could save someone else.
00:35:25.040,00:35:26.792,He didn't sacrifice anything.
00:35:26.833,00:35:28.293,He died a long time ago.
00:35:28.334,00:35:30.670,His crew is probably gone.
00:35:30.712,00:35:33.172,"In prison, he was a nobody."
00:35:35.341,00:35:39.137,And now?
00:35:35.341,00:35:40.722,"He lives on as a hero to Eric's family, to the press, to you."
00:35:50.732,00:35:52.317,Jaundice is improving.
00:35:52.358,00:35:54.277,"Edema's resolving, too."
00:35:56.822,00:35:58.865,It's been great night.
00:35:58.907,00:36:01.284,"Three other lives were saved, as well."
00:36:01.326,00:36:03.161,Does his parents know what he did?
00:36:08.792,00:36:11.169,"I know they're gonna be sad, but..."
00:36:12.879,00:36:16.466,I want to tell them I'll take good care of their son's liver.
00:36:19.594,00:36:21.638,I think that's a great idea.
00:36:38.947,00:36:41.741,Wow.
00:36:41.783,00:36:44.536,"It's kind of like prom, but without the acne."
00:36:49.833,00:36:51.126,Would you do me the honor?
00:36:52.251,00:36:56.255,you look cool Classy.
00:36:56.297,00:36:57.382,I brought my A-game.
00:36:57.423,00:37:31.541,"no more slow cuts you look cool to rain on parades in some shades a day I stay in the house WOMAN: Ooh, you look great!"
00:37:38.006,00:38:05.784,"and show out have a good time a good time a good time a good time a good time The first little while is the hardest, and then you move on."
00:38:05.825,00:38:07.869,You never did.
00:38:07.911,00:38:09.537,"Well, that's true."
00:38:09.579,00:38:10.872,Doesn't mean you don't have to.
00:38:13.291,00:38:14.626,Maybe.
00:38:14.667,00:38:15.961,Thank you.
00:38:16.002,00:38:17.254,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
00:38:17.295,00:38:18.797,Are you gonna sit around and mope?
00:38:18.838,00:38:20.215,At least try.
00:38:21.800,00:38:23.260,How do I do that?
00:38:23.301,00:38:24.719,I don't know.
00:38:24.761,00:38:27.097,"If I knew, I would have done it."
00:38:27.722,00:38:28.932,Let's dance.
00:38:28.974,00:38:30.391,Okay.
00:38:41.111,00:38:42.528,SPIRIT: Don't be shy.
00:38:42.570,00:38:44.281,Look!
00:38:46.407,00:38:48.534,"Ooh, you smell good, Jenny."
00:38:48.576,00:38:50.245,"What is that, strawberry?"
00:38:50.287,00:38:51.871,Strawberry mango.
00:38:53.456,00:38:54.582,We can go together!
00:38:54.624,00:38:55.750,It's a plan!
00:38:55.792,00:38:57.627,Let's all go!
00:38:57.669,00:38:59.212,"GIRL: You know what, let's take a selfie."
00:38:59.254,00:39:00.588,GIRLS: Yes.
00:39:00.630,00:39:01.798,That's a great idea.
00:39:01.840,00:39:03.049,"Bring it in, guys!"
00:39:03.091,00:39:04.425,Peace sign!
00:39:05.677,00:39:06.886,Yay!
00:39:06.928,00:39:08.721,That was so funny.
00:39:20.650,00:39:21.943,Okay.
00:39:24.612,00:39:26.948,between us still Remember this?
00:39:27.615,00:39:29.117,Should I?
00:39:31.328,00:39:32.996,You really don't remember?
00:39:34.289,00:39:35.623,No.
00:39:39.418,00:39:40.712,What's wrong?
00:39:42.964,00:39:45.466,It's the song that played during our first overnight at the hospital.
00:39:45.508,00:39:49.595,but I'm too late We had our first kiss to this song.
00:39:49.637,00:39:54.893,but there's history I'm sorry.
00:39:54.934,00:39:57.436,It's been a long day.
00:39:59.147,00:40:00.232,Yeah.
00:40:00.273,00:40:03.068,"Jared, it doesn't mean anything."
00:40:04.527,00:40:05.904,"Yeah, it does."
00:40:07.488,00:40:12.410,"between us still I love you, Claire."
00:40:13.078,00:40:14.412,You never loved me.
00:40:16.122,00:40:22.003,"Now, I thought that maybe someday that would change, but it won't."
00:40:22.045,00:40:29.468,"I'm out of my mind Bye, Claire."
00:40:29.510,00:41:08.674,"between us still and I don't know why but now I know it's over DR. LEVY: I have 140 applications for fellows, not one of them has a clue how to write an..."
00:41:08.716,00:41:09.759,Hello.
00:41:09.801,00:41:12.011,I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.
00:41:12.053,00:41:13.888,I'm a resident here.
00:41:15.640,00:41:18.351,"I'm Dr. Jake Levy, surgical oncology."
00:41:19.060,00:41:20.979,"Toby Yang, pathology."
00:41:21.020,00:41:22.897,"May Curtis, ortho."
00:41:27.693,00:41:28.903,Okay.
00:41:28.945,00:41:30.529,Apparently I was wrong.
00:41:30.571,00:41:35.410,I told Dr. Murphy he'd be fine renting a tuxedo.
00:41:35.452,00:41:37.162,"Clearly, he chose not to listen."
00:41:37.203,00:41:38.537,I'm sorry.
00:41:38.579,00:41:39.998,Don't be.
00:41:40.039,00:41:41.458,"What is it, Armani?"
00:41:41.499,00:41:43.584,"Yes, it cost..."
00:41:43.626,00:41:46.629,"Well, whatever you paid for it, it was worth."
00:41:47.797,00:41:49.174,"How's the golf game, Jake?"
00:41:49.215,00:41:50.925,"Oh, same as always."
00:41:50.967,00:41:52.677,I know how that is.
00:41:52.718,00:41:54.679,"You play golf, Murphy?"
00:41:54.720,00:41:57.556,"I have, but I don't like it."
00:42:00.268,00:42:02.770,None...
00:42:02.812,00:42:06.399,You know what they say...
00:42:08.193,00:42:09.694,Yes.
00:00:07.090,00:00:14.055,"The rides were actually fun, Claire, even though they hurl you through the air very quickly without a proper three-point seat belt."
00:00:14.097,00:00:16.475,It was worth the $300 I spent.
00:00:16.517,00:00:18.185,What kind of carnival will cost you that much money?
00:00:18.226,00:00:20.521,It was not just the carnival.
00:00:20.562,00:00:29.237,"Kenny's girlfriend wanted to go to see a movie afterwards, but I just got the second edition of Chaikof's Atlas of Vascular Therapy so decided not to go."
00:00:29.279,00:00:30.364,And you paid for everyone?
00:00:30.405,00:00:31.740,I had to.
00:00:31.782,00:00:34.451,Rounds will have to wait.
00:00:34.493,00:00:35.995,"Hunter Denoble, 38."
00:00:36.036,00:00:38.163,Came into the E.R.
00:00:38.205,00:00:40.332,X-rays show anterolisthesis.
00:00:42.459,00:00:44.920,Unless there's a history of spinal trauma.
00:00:44.962,00:00:46.296,There is.
00:00:46.338,00:00:50.258,Hunter fractured seven vertebrae in his neck and back in a motorcycle accident 10 years ago.
00:00:50.300,00:00:52.011,He was one of my first patients.
00:00:54.555,00:00:57.016,"...a few months back, just gnawing pain."
00:00:57.057,00:00:59.184,Ibuprofen usually took the edge off.
00:00:59.226,00:01:00.686,Every day?
00:01:00.728,00:01:03.522,"Uh, yeah, give or take."
00:01:03.564,00:01:06.233,It's not that bad.
00:01:06.274,00:01:09.486,"He couldn't move his neck at all, and the pain medicine had no effect."
00:01:09.528,00:01:12.656,"So, he wanted to tough it out, but I dragged him in here."
00:01:13.908,00:01:15.116,Feel that?
00:01:15.158,00:01:16.035,Yeah.
00:01:17.494,00:01:19.246,I made partner at the firm.
00:01:19.287,00:01:21.456,I don't like to call in sick.
00:01:21.498,00:01:25.293,"And let's face it, I've spent enough nights in hospital rooms for five lifetimes."
00:01:25.335,00:01:27.462,Can't argue with that.
00:01:34.219,00:01:36.931,The plain films showed what looked like a herniated disc.
00:01:36.972,00:01:39.558,Which would mean...?
00:01:41.560,00:01:45.355,"Day procedure, he'd be out by the morning at the latest."
00:01:45.397,00:01:47.232,You married him?
00:01:49.860,00:01:52.696,"Yes, three years ago in Cancun."
00:01:52.738,00:01:55.156,Even though he's in a wheelchair?
00:01:56.742,00:01:58.619,I get this all the time.
00:01:58.660,00:02:00.537,"Sure, she can never wear heels, but think of the parking."
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.083,DR. MELENDEZ: What happened?
00:02:04.124,00:02:06.085,Pain shot right down through my legs.
00:02:06.126,00:02:08.420,Your legs?
00:02:08.462,00:02:10.589,I haven't felt anything below my chest in 10 years.
00:02:10.631,00:02:12.007,What the hell is going on?
00:02:29.149,00:02:59.178,I could fly away in the sand in my hand Mom.
00:03:07.146,00:03:08.605,CLAIRE: I don't want to see you.
00:03:08.647,00:03:10.482,But I haven't seen you in years.
00:03:10.524,00:03:12.109,Don't run away from me.
00:03:12.151,00:03:14.444,Can we talk?
00:03:12.151,00:03:16.571,"Since I don't want to see you, it follows that I don't want to hear from you, either."
00:03:18.824,00:03:20.492,I just came in to get antibiotics.
00:03:20.534,00:03:22.201,My surgeon doesn't work on Fridays.
00:03:22.744,00:03:24.329,It feels fine.
00:03:24.371,00:03:26.165,"Sorry, it's not fine."
00:03:26.205,00:03:28.249,This implant is definitely infected.
00:03:28.291,00:03:30.044,"Just that one, though, right?"
00:03:30.085,00:03:37.384,"Yes. At this point, your butt lift, tummy tuck, lipo, and breast augmentation appear to be healthy."
00:03:42.139,00:03:44.016,"Well, can you replace it?"
00:03:44.058,00:03:47.310,Once the infection is resolved and you have a few months to heal.
00:03:47.352,00:03:49.938,I don't want to walk around with half of a face for a few months.
00:03:49.980,00:03:52.066,Isn't there anything you can do to save the implant?
00:03:52.107,00:03:56.695,"I can't make any guarantees, but if I can replace the implant without risking re-infection, I will."
00:03:58.655,00:04:00.240,"Okay, Doctor."
00:04:09.666,00:04:13.253,"I didn't understand the lyrics, but I liked your mom's voice."
00:04:14.004,00:04:16.882,Is she a professional singer?
00:04:16.924,00:04:20.010,She is a lot of things.
00:04:20.052,00:04:21.762,Great mom wasn't one of them.
00:04:21.803,00:04:23.764,How so?
00:04:23.805,00:04:26.725,"A lot of people have issues with their parents, nothing new."
00:04:26.767,00:04:29.269,But everyone's story's different.
00:04:31.688,00:04:33.314,How so?
00:04:36.985,00:04:41.281,"When I was in high school, I babysat the kids in my neighborhood."
00:04:41.322,00:04:48.413,"I wanted to buy a laptop for school like a lot of my friends had, so I saved up 1,000 bucks."
00:04:49.039,00:04:53.543,"I came home one day, and the money was gone and so was my mother."
00:04:53.585,00:05:03.303,"And three days later, she came back from Reno with a designer dress and a guy named Ricky."
00:05:05.388,00:05:07.307,I never got the laptop.
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.983,My mom made pancakes.
00:05:16.024,00:05:17.400,They were good.
00:05:19.736,00:05:21.321,"Mmm, what is that?"
00:05:26.367,00:05:28.120,I've never seen anything like that.
00:05:28.162,00:05:30.080,Maybe a spinal column tumor.
00:05:30.122,00:05:39.338,"Hunter's initial spinal cord injury from the motorcycle accident that caused his paralysis was at T1, but that part looks almost completely normal now."
00:05:48.098,00:05:53.603,"My former mentor, Sonya Kung, is head of the surgical residency program at Denver Memorial Hospital."
00:05:53.645,00:05:55.396,"If you want a meeting, I'll make the call."
00:06:01.402,00:06:04.114,"You just trying to screw with my head, or are you actually being serious?"
00:06:04.156,00:06:05.782,The opportunity is real.
00:06:05.824,00:06:08.160,I'm trying to be nice.
00:06:08.202,00:06:10.411,I do that when it doesn't hurt me.
00:06:10.453,00:06:14.666,"And this definitely doesn't hurt you, you getting rid of some competition."
00:06:14.708,00:06:18.503,"True, although you're not high on my list of threats."
00:06:18.545,00:06:20.797,This would be a much bigger benefit for you.
00:06:20.839,00:06:23.800,"Look, I fought to stay here."
00:06:23.842,00:06:25.302,I'm not going anywhere.
00:06:32.433,00:06:39.482,"It's very rare, but after many years with a bruised cord like yours that isn't severed, it can start to function again."
00:06:39.524,00:06:41.943,"So, this mass is causing Hunter's pain?"
00:06:41.985,00:06:43.278,Yes.
00:06:46.447,00:06:49.701,"The mass is compressing the healthy cord, just letting the pain through."
00:06:49.743,00:06:57.416,"We still have to do some more advanced imaging to map the mass, but I am fairly confident that if we removed it that could change."
00:07:00.003,00:07:01.629,You may be able to walk again.
00:07:15.394,00:07:16.728,You think it looks okay?
00:07:16.770,00:07:20.357,"I love it, and you are going to look great at the beach."
00:07:23.360,00:07:24.485,Wailea?
00:07:25.862,00:07:27.906,We went there on our honeymoon.
00:07:31.034,00:07:32.869,He's taking you to Hawaii.
00:07:32.911,00:07:35.289,"Oh, I'm so relieved."
00:07:36.998,00:07:38.750,Satisfied customers.
00:07:38.792,00:07:42.254,This is why cosmetics is the most fun specialty.
00:07:42.296,00:07:43.922,"Now, we're gonna monitor you closely."
00:07:43.964,00:07:46.883,There is a risk the infection could have seeded to other implants.
00:07:46.925,00:07:48.176,Keep me posted.
00:07:48.218,00:07:49.303,"Yes, Chief."
00:07:49.344,00:07:51.012,I'll take the early shift.
00:07:53.681,00:07:58.312,"Once I'm on my feet, I'm never sitting down again."
00:07:58.353,00:08:01.064,I'm gonna take Cora dancing.
00:08:01.106,00:08:02.774,She's a great dancer.
00:08:04.525,00:08:06.069,I push myself.
00:08:06.111,00:08:08.488,No offense. It's my rule.
00:08:10.782,00:08:12.326,Right.
00:08:13.618,00:08:21.626,"If this works, after a considerable amount of physical therapy you may be able to walk, but that doesn't mean you'll be a very good dancer."
00:08:21.668,00:08:25.505,"After years of atrophy from not moving your legs, you will likely be very bad."
00:08:29.634,00:08:31.761,You know what the worst part is?
00:08:31.803,00:08:33.430,It isn't being in the chair.
00:08:33.472,00:08:35.723,It's that people see the chair first.
00:08:37.267,00:08:38.685,You know what I'm talking about.
00:08:38.726,00:08:41.771,Why would I know what you're talking about?
00:08:41.813,00:08:44.858,My brother-in-law's on the spectrum.
00:08:44.899,00:08:47.610,I make it a priority of hiring people with disabilities.
00:08:47.652,00:08:49.154,Let me guess.
00:08:47.652,00:08:51.739,"When you first started working here, no one believed in you."
00:08:51.781,00:08:53.908,They didn't know that I was going to make a good surgeon.
00:08:53.950,00:08:55.535,HUNTER: No.
00:08:59.580,00:09:03.251,I guarantee you every other doctor started with a basic level of respect.
00:09:03.293,00:09:05.712,It's implied they're competent.
00:09:07.714,00:09:10.091,We waste our time and energy trying to prove that we belong.
00:09:19.226,00:09:20.435,EMMA: I'm fine.
00:09:20.477,00:09:22.479,"She's just being thorough, honey."
00:09:24.814,00:09:26.691,Early infections often mimic blemishes.
00:09:30.945,00:09:32.780,Maybe a little.
00:09:35.158,00:09:39.620,"It could be nothing, or it could be a carbuncle, an early sign of infection."
00:09:39.662,00:09:42.207,Dr. Andrews needs to have a look at this.
00:09:48.213,00:09:53.218,This varicocele is raising testicular temperature and causing your sperm count to be low.
00:09:53.260,00:09:58.098,"Surgically, I go in, ligate the varicocele and re-check your numbers in a few weeks."
00:09:58.139,00:10:02.227,"It's done under a local, so no anesthesia risks, minimal blood loss."
00:10:02.269,00:10:06.606,"There's a risk of low testosterone and impotence, but recovery time's usually a week at most."
00:10:10.860,00:10:13.154,"So, I could have kids, I just might not be able to make them?"
00:10:13.196,00:10:15.073,"As I said, it's low risk."
00:10:15.115,00:10:17.117,I only mention it because I'm obligated to inform you.
00:10:17.158,00:10:19.994,"Well, you're obligated to inform me because it's a risk."
00:10:24.374,00:10:26.334,I do it right here in the office.
00:10:26.376,00:10:30.338,What I see here is a chance to fix a problem.
00:10:30.380,00:10:32.132,And I see a chance to create a new one.
00:10:34.968,00:10:36.636,"I'm... I'm sorry, I have to go."
00:10:40.140,00:10:41.724,"Look, I see a lot of men with this issue."
00:10:41.766,00:10:46.521,"Sure, they come in because they want kids, but I think what they really want is to reaffirm themselves."
00:10:46.563,00:10:48.315,And that's a good thing.
00:10:54.737,00:10:58.241,It's a spinal arachnoid meningioma.
00:10:58.283,00:11:00.118,Have you seen one of these before?
00:11:00.160,00:11:01.328,DR. MELENDEZ: Much smaller.
00:11:01.369,00:11:06.416,They usually don't get this big because the pain and weakness brings the patient into the E.R. fast.
00:11:06.458,00:11:10.295,"But in this case, no pain, no E.R. visit until it got this big."
00:11:10.337,00:11:12.713,And it's wrapped around the spinal cord tightly and fused with the dura.
00:11:12.755,00:11:15.008,Can we get a fiber-optic laser and take it out in segments?
00:11:18.928,00:11:22.807,It stopped growing and settled in this position.
00:11:22.849,00:11:28.855,But I do think that we can dissect along the subarachnoid plane down to the largest segment at T2 and remove it in one piece.
00:11:28.896,00:11:31.149,That's an extension of the mass.
00:11:37.738,00:11:41.700,The pyramids are more central and the color is wrong.
00:11:42.369,00:11:44.538,Murphy's right.
00:11:50.251,00:11:51.378,DR. ANDREWS: Who caught it?
00:11:51.419,00:11:52.753,Jared did.
00:11:53.838,00:11:55.131,DR. ANDREWS: Nice work.
00:11:55.173,00:11:56.633,Most first-year residents would have missed this.
00:11:56.675,00:12:01.221,"It's very small on the surface, but I can feel the fluctuance under the skin."
00:12:01.262,00:12:03.139,What do we need to do to fix it?
00:12:09.312,00:12:12.731,"Unfortunately, it will cause significant permanent scarring."
00:12:15.068,00:12:16.861,I'll look worse than I did before.
00:12:16.903,00:12:18.905,I... I don't get it.
00:12:16.903,00:12:21.700,"You removed the bad part from her face, and it's fixed."
00:12:21.740,00:12:23.284,Let's just do the same with the rest of 'em.
00:12:23.326,00:12:24.911,It's not that simple.
00:12:24.952,00:12:30.041,"When we removed the infection from Emma's cheek, it was under the pretense it was a localized issue."
00:12:30.083,00:12:33.752,"If we just take out the infection from the new area, it could jump again."
00:12:38.049,00:12:40.552,"When an infection spreads, it often moves very quickly."
00:12:40.594,00:12:41.720,What Dr. Andrews is saying...
00:12:41.760,00:12:43.388,I understand what he's saying.
00:12:45.348,00:12:48.685,I'm 50 years old.
00:12:48.727,00:12:56.901,"When I went to drop my daughter off at Michigan, we went to that bar on Liberty Street, where we first met."
00:12:56.943,00:13:03.782,"I saw myself sitting there 25 years ago, young, confident, full of potential."
00:13:06.494,00:13:14.252,"Then you raise a kid and look after your husband, a home."
00:13:18.465,00:13:20.091,You lose touch with who you were.
00:13:23.844,00:13:25.930,"You... You said it was an infection, right?"
00:13:25.972,00:13:27.806,Like strep throat or something.
00:13:28.683,00:13:31.018,That's what antibiotics are for.
00:13:31.060,00:13:32.562,Couldn't we just use that?
00:13:35.231,00:13:41.404,"We could try strong, broad-spectrum antibiotics, but I really don't want to do that."
00:13:41.446,00:13:42.656,You could become septic.
00:13:49.828,00:13:51.790,It'll work.
00:13:52.248,00:13:53.667,It has to.
00:13:56.961,00:13:58.421,The brainstem is complex.
00:13:58.463,00:14:00.881,Even our best imaging can't provide a complete picture.
00:14:04.594,00:14:06.887,"ALEX: Other than the pain, it's not harming Hunter."
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.264,It's stabilized now and done growing.
00:14:08.306,00:14:09.974,But what about the pain?
00:14:15.854,00:14:17.691,But I won't be able to walk.
00:14:19.233,00:14:20.735,No.
00:14:27.367,00:14:29.869,Exactly how risky is removing the mass from the brainstem?
00:14:29.910,00:14:33.289,Everything that keeps your heart beating and you breathing is right there.
00:14:36.125,00:14:38.169,You'd sleep in your bed tonight pain-free.
00:14:38.211,00:14:39.629,Give me a percentage on this thing.
00:14:39.671,00:14:41.047,Don't do this to yourself.
00:14:41.088,00:14:43.174,I don't like to give those kinds of numbers.
00:14:43.216,00:14:45.009,"They're population-based, and they don't apply to your exact circumstance."
00:14:45.051,00:14:46.469,I understand how statistics work.
00:14:46.511,00:14:48.680,"But there's a number, and it's relevant."
00:14:51.265,00:14:54.561,There's a 15% chance the surgery would kill you.
00:15:02.569,00:15:05.655,I remember the moment I accepted I'd never walk again.
00:15:07.281,00:15:09.909,It wasn't when Dr. Melendez told me after the accident.
00:15:19.960,00:15:22.505,I looked out the window and there's all these people just living their lives.
00:15:25.132,00:15:30.555,"I'm trying to fix something that I can't change, and life was going on without me."
00:15:41.982,00:15:43.610,But now there's something I can do.
00:15:47.864,00:15:49.240,Hunter...
00:15:53.035,00:15:54.954,I want to talk to Dr. Melendez.
00:15:59.375,00:16:00.752,No.
00:16:00.794,00:16:01.920,Please.
00:16:21.815,00:16:23.608,About why I gave you the credit?
00:16:23.650,00:16:28.237,"I assume you thought it was a set-up, that Andrews thought you were wrong and you tried to throw it on me."
00:16:28.279,00:16:29.948,That's very cynical.
00:16:35.662,00:16:37.831,There is a third possibility.
00:16:39.290,00:16:40.834,I'm proving a point.
00:16:40.875,00:16:46.380,"When you lose their respect, no matter what you do, no matter how many wins you chalk up, you'll never get it back."
00:16:46.422,00:16:48.007,The game's already over.
00:16:48.048,00:16:49.049,You lost.
00:16:50.844,00:16:52.679,Does anyone like you?
00:16:52.720,00:16:54.514,I like me.
00:16:54.555,00:16:56.015,LAB TECH: I've got results.
00:17:01.061,00:17:05.024,"I know this is her first cycle of antibiotics, but I'm not seeing any improvement."
00:17:09.737,00:17:14.826,"You'd be under anesthesia for nine hours, and I'll need to make sure that your body's healthy enough to handle the stress."
00:17:14.868,00:17:16.995,"Will you tell him not to do this, please?"
00:17:19.539,00:17:20.999,HUNTER: I'm the one in the chair.
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.208,You have no idea what that's like.
00:17:22.249,00:17:24.168,I'm right there with you.
00:17:24.210,00:17:25.879,Who carries you up the stairs?
00:17:29.465,00:17:31.342,"Well, this way you won't have to do those things anymore."
00:17:31.384,00:17:33.928,So you just want to gamble the life that you have for the life that you had?
00:17:33.970,00:17:35.304,Cora.
00:17:37.557,00:17:41.310,"We have a great life, but I want to walk again."
00:17:42.562,00:17:44.271,And I want you to see me walk.
00:17:47.191,00:17:49.276,I'm not gonna stand by and watch you die.
00:17:49.318,00:17:54.156,"If you want to selfishly gamble your life away, you're doing it on your own."
00:17:56.701,00:17:58.118,I'm doing this for us.
00:17:59.245,00:18:01.956,"No, you're doing this for you."
00:18:21.935,00:18:23.686,"Hey. Uh, I got a page?"
00:18:29.483,00:18:32.403,"I'm busy, and I don't like being tricked into coming down here."
00:18:34.363,00:18:36.407,Seeing you is not healthy for me.
00:18:36.449,00:18:39.326,"Okay, wait..."
00:18:43.122,00:18:45.416,I am sick.
00:18:45.458,00:18:47.043,"I know, you've been telling me that for years."
00:18:47.085,00:18:48.544,You were right.
00:18:49.545,00:18:51.130,I got help.
00:18:51.171,00:18:53.549,They have me on mood stabilizers.
00:18:53.591,00:18:55.509,I'm doing better now.
00:18:55.551,00:18:57.804,"I mean, sometimes the meds make me feel flat."
00:19:00.347,00:19:02.141,"No lows, though, either."
00:19:03.726,00:19:06.312,I'd like to try again to be your mom.
00:19:08.856,00:19:11.567,"I mean, maybe we could just talk some more?"
00:19:14.070,00:19:15.905,I'll think about it.
00:19:15.947,00:19:18.198,"Well, take these."
00:19:18.240,00:19:20.118,They need water or they're gonna die.
00:19:21.619,00:19:23.121,My number's on the card.
00:19:35.508,00:19:38.845,I think I just won the Tour de France.
00:19:38.886,00:19:42.140,It's a long surgery.
00:19:45.101,00:19:48.187,Your cardiovascular fitness is excellent.
00:19:49.396,00:19:51.440,Huh!
00:19:56.529,00:19:57.905,"You get it, right?"
00:19:58.364,00:19:59.991,Get what?
00:20:00.033,00:20:01.617,Why I want this surgery so bad.
00:20:03.119,00:20:04.996,"You'd jump at a cure for autism, wouldn't ya?"
00:20:05.038,00:20:08.041,There isn't a cure for autism.
00:20:08.082,00:20:12.045,"Well, last week I didn't think there was a surgery to help me."
00:20:17.050,00:20:19.593,The surgery isn't guaranteed to help you walk.
00:20:20.594,00:20:24.390,Why would you risk losing a person who accepts you the way you are?
00:20:24.431,00:20:27.351,You may not find another one.
00:20:31.480,00:20:33.191,I'm sure there are a lot of reasons to marry you.
00:20:33.232,00:20:40.280,"Yes. I'm organized, I have excellent visual-spatial memory, and Lea says I'm refreshingly honest and fair."
00:20:42.658,00:20:46.704,I suppose Cora loves me because I'm determined...
00:20:46.746,00:20:54.253,"I'm pretty smart, committed to helping others, and most of all, probably because I'm patient."
00:20:56.047,00:20:58.091,Were you always those things?
00:21:05.848,00:21:08.726,Your autism helped you.
00:21:08.768,00:21:10.686,You're saying this chair made me a better person.
00:21:13.397,00:21:19.987,The difference is losing this chair now won't make me lose the lessons it gave me.
00:21:27.995,00:21:30.623,The antibiotics aren't working.
00:21:30.664,00:21:33.960,"I told you if they didn't, we'd be doing surgery next."
00:21:36.420,00:21:37.922,No.
00:21:52.436,00:21:53.938,I need you to trust me.
00:22:10.163,00:22:11.914,She wants a second opinion.
00:22:11.956,00:22:13.582,She's going to die.
00:22:13.624,00:22:14.834,I told her that.
00:22:32.268,00:22:35.353,"DR. MELENDEZ: Sometimes, it's tough to actually get out of those doors."
00:22:56.374,00:22:57.918,I took care of her a lot.
00:22:57.960,00:23:00.546,"Brushed her teeth, combed her hair, fed her."
00:23:04.300,00:23:14.392,"Hunter was my first patient as an attending, and I had to walk in that room and tell him that there was nothing I could do for him, nothing I could do to fix him."
00:23:15.936,00:23:17.395,And now there is?
00:23:20.524,00:23:22.276,But there's no guarantee.
00:23:22.318,00:23:23.986,There is never a guarantee.
00:23:32.203,00:23:37.291,"I'm sorry, but I can't risk losing the man that I fell in love with."
00:23:43.047,00:23:46.384,You're not just afraid that the surgery will kill him.
00:23:46.424,00:23:48.135,You're afraid that it might work.
00:23:50.388,00:23:52.098,You've only known Hunter in a wheelchair.
00:23:52.139,00:24:00.856,"Walking would be a fundamental change in who he is, a fundamental change in who you are as a couple."
00:24:00.898,00:24:03.441,"You're worried that no matter what happens, you're gonna lose him."
00:24:07.654,00:24:09.282,Hunter seems to have a great life.
00:24:09.323,00:24:11.325,I don't know if I'd risk giving that up.
00:24:18.582,00:24:19.708,Would you do it?
00:24:19.750,00:24:21.668,That's not a fair comparison.
00:24:21.710,00:24:27.549,"Well, you said Hunter's doing fine the way he is, but we're talking about giving him something more."
00:24:27.591,00:24:29.009,What about 2%?
00:24:30.510,00:24:31.845,I don't think there's a number for me.
00:24:31.887,00:24:33.389,"Oh, of course there's a number."
00:24:33.431,00:24:38.060,"Every time you get in your car, hell, every time you leave your home, you take a risk something bad could happen."
00:24:38.102,00:24:44.733,"But you do it anyway, you know, to make yourself better, to make the world better, sometimes just to have fun."
00:24:44.775,00:24:47.320,Sometimes to go to a carnival.
00:24:47.361,00:24:49.071,Kenny's not your friend.
00:24:49.113,00:24:50.488,He's using you.
00:24:51.740,00:24:53.742,I...don't think so.
00:24:56.203,00:25:02.460,"Mostly misdemeanors, but there's a couple felony theft cases that were bargained down."
00:25:02.500,00:25:05.879,"Wait, you ran a background check on Kenny?"
00:25:05.921,00:25:09.091,"Well, you start by talking, I start by gathering evidence."
00:25:11.010,00:25:13.053,I'll forward it to you.
00:25:27.525,00:25:32.448,"In my experience, there are only two reasons why a married person has this kind of cosmetic surgery."
00:25:32.490,00:25:34.532,Either you're halfway out the door or she is.
00:25:35.951,00:25:37.328,Emma loves me.
00:25:38.787,00:25:40.706,That's what I figured.
00:25:41.957,00:25:52.801,"The antibiotics aren't working, so your wife is going to die unless you get in there and you convince her that she doesn't need any of this cosmetic surgery because you are a faithful, loving husband."
00:26:01.768,00:26:03.020,CORA: How's the pain?
00:26:07.316,00:26:10.652,"You know, I think the adrenaline of actually doing this is helping."
00:26:10.694,00:26:12.238,It's the oxycodone.
00:26:13.989,00:26:15.408,That's good.
00:26:16.450,00:26:17.575,I'm glad you came back.
00:26:18.452,00:26:20.120,I never left.
00:26:28.546,00:26:31.215,I don't want to do this without you.
00:26:31.257,00:26:33.008,I don't want to do anything without you.
00:26:35.094,00:26:38.596,"If you can walk, you'll be different."
00:26:44.478,00:26:46.980,You think I married you 'cause I was having trouble hanging clothes in my closet?
00:26:48.941,00:26:50.276,You're my girl.
00:26:51.277,00:26:53.195,I will always need you.
00:26:53.237,00:26:58.742,"Even if I could fly, who's gonna remind me to call my mom on her birthday?"
00:27:02.746,00:27:04.622,Who's gonna remind me to be a better person?
00:27:08.252,00:27:10.170,Who's gonna hold my hand when I'm scared?
00:27:18.971,00:27:20.638,That was nice.
00:27:48.292,00:27:52.630,You were distant before.
00:27:52.670,00:27:55.591,"Since the surgery, you can't get enough of me."
00:27:56.634,00:27:59.136,It worked.
00:27:59.178,00:28:01.013,I love you.
00:28:01.054,00:28:02.973,I always will.
00:28:03.015,00:28:04.766,No. Never.
00:28:04.808,00:28:07.102,"If you were in love with me, you never would've cheated on me."
00:28:08.521,00:28:15.693,"Barry, please, no more lies."
00:28:16.862,00:28:19.281,You were never home.
00:28:20.115,00:28:21.699,You were never there.
00:28:26.622,00:28:28.290,There was never another woman.
00:28:28.332,00:28:32.085,I was gambling... A lot.
00:28:34.463,00:28:37.883,"When we got married, I promised you the world, and instead I gave you a mediocre life."
00:28:39.134,00:28:43.722,"When I was up, it made me feel like a winner."
00:28:46.016,00:28:49.353,"And I was too embarrassed to let you see me like that, so I hid it from you."
00:29:00.155,00:29:02.199,She's gonna do the surgery.
00:29:02.241,00:29:03.492,Thank you.
00:29:11.833,00:29:13.835,Andrews needs an O.R.
00:29:34.231,00:29:39.778,"Claire, you're beautiful, smart, and very good at your job."
00:29:42.197,00:29:44.783,"Thank you, Shaun."
00:29:44.824,00:29:48.370,Would you ever date someone with a disability?
00:29:50.289,00:29:51.790,"Yeah, sure."
00:29:55.210,00:29:58.422,"You could choose the ideal mate, Claire."
00:29:58.464,00:30:01.550,Why would you want the unnecessary burden?
00:30:01.592,00:30:05.512,Everyone is dealing with something.
00:30:05.554,00:30:12.645,"We just have to love other people for who they are and hope they love us, too."
00:30:17.149,00:30:18.817,O.R. 1's prepped for Hunter.
00:30:22.655,00:30:24.323,I'll join you in a minute.
00:30:45.552,00:30:47.012,"So, what changed her mind?"
00:30:47.763,00:30:48.847,Jared did.
00:31:01.568,00:31:03.987,Make the call.
00:31:04.029,00:31:05.864,Thanks.
00:31:13.706,00:31:15.290,This is as far as you can go.
00:31:15.332,00:31:16.875,Nurse Matthews will take you to the waiting room.
00:31:17.167,00:31:18.711,Okay.
00:31:18.752,00:31:21.046,"Can I, uh..."
00:31:34.393,00:31:36.353,I can't do this.
00:31:39.356,00:31:41.525,"This is what you do in a relationship, right?"
00:31:48.365,00:31:49.742,Okay.
00:32:07.467,00:32:10.178,MORGAN: That's a large tissue defect in the left breast.
00:32:10.220,00:32:14.224,"DR. ANDREWS: If we'd been in here six hours ago, I could have salvaged more underlying muscle tissue."
00:32:14.266,00:32:15.768,JARED: I'm noticing her heart rate jump.
00:32:15.809,00:32:16.935,"You seeing that, JL?"
00:32:18.270,00:32:20.063,JL: I am now.
00:32:20.105,00:32:21.690,DR. ANDREWS: How's her surgical sites?
00:32:21.732,00:32:23.149,I'm not seeing any bleeding.
00:32:24.401,00:32:25.736,MORGAN: Everything looks good here.
00:32:25.778,00:32:27.195,Maybe the anesthesia's light?
00:32:27.237,00:32:29.782,"JARED: Nope. No, something's definitely happening."
00:32:29.823,00:32:31.950,DR. ANDREWS: Jared's right.
00:32:36.996,00:32:38.206,"DR. MELENDEZ: Suction, Claire."
00:32:38.248,00:32:40.459,Give me a 25 on a 130.
00:32:40.500,00:32:46.214,"All right, Murphy, I want you to cut right under my forceps very carefully."
00:32:49.635,00:32:50.969,SHAUN: Section's cut.
00:32:51.010,00:32:52.638,DR. MELENDEZ: How are the motor evoked potentials?
00:32:52.679,00:32:54.973,"ALEX: Signal's coming through, spinal cord's functioning normally."
00:32:59.978,00:33:02.481,DR. MELENDEZ: The mass has fully encased the medullary cord.
00:33:06.067,00:33:07.736,Give me the ferromagnetic wand.
00:33:12.031,00:33:14.701,I can't get the caudal end clear of the underlying cord.
00:33:14.743,00:33:16.453,ALEX: Got a big drop in potentials.
00:33:16.495,00:33:17.913,SHAUN: We are compressing his brainstem.
00:33:17.955,00:33:19.038,DR. MELENDEZ: What's his pressure?
00:33:19.080,00:33:20.499,CLAIRE: Mean arterial pressure's 70.
00:33:20.540,00:33:21.875,ALEX: I got nothing now.
00:33:21.917,00:33:23.710,DR. MELENDEZ: Push IV fluids.
00:33:23.752,00:33:25.504,SHAUN: Hunter's going into neurogenic shock.
00:33:25.545,00:33:26.839,We need to stop the surgery.
00:33:26.880,00:33:28.131,DR. MELENDEZ: I'm almost there.
00:33:28.173,00:33:30.175,CLAIRE: Pressure's 60.
00:33:32.302,00:33:34.304,It's probably edema.
00:33:36.640,00:33:37.766,ALEX: Still nothing.
00:33:37.808,00:33:39.225,SHAUN: He's dying.
00:33:39.267,00:33:41.019,DR. MELENDEZ: It's one damn centimeter of tissue.
00:33:44.022,00:33:45.148,JARED: All clear.
00:33:47.108,00:33:49.486,MORGAN: That's her second dose of amiodarone.
00:33:49.528,00:33:51.655,DR. ANDREWS: She's thrown her septic embolism.
00:33:51.697,00:33:52.698,I'm cracking her chest.
00:33:58.495,00:33:59.997,JARED: Ten joules. Clear.
00:34:01.247,00:34:02.624,DR. ANDREWS: Again.
00:34:02.666,00:34:04.042,JARED: Clear.
00:34:06.127,00:34:08.254,DR. ANDREWS: Starting cardiac massage.
00:34:26.523,00:34:27.941,It's time to call it.
00:34:31.862,00:34:33.947,"MORGAN: Time of death, 10:23."
00:35:39.471,00:35:41.098,"DR. MELENDEZ: Welcome back, Hunter."
00:35:42.265,00:35:49.606,"The mass was tightly adhered in some spots, so we're not exactly sure what to expect moving forward."
00:35:49.648,00:35:51.900,We're gonna be bringing in several specialists to work with you.
00:35:51.942,00:35:53.777,The first will be a neurophysiatrist...
00:35:53.819,00:35:55.988,Thank you.
00:35:56.029,00:35:58.364,Thank you.
00:35:58.406,00:36:01.326,Would you mind if we talked about the rest of this later?
00:36:02.535,00:36:04.370,I just want to sit with my wife.
00:36:08.667,00:36:10.543,Thank you.
00:36:49.207,00:36:51.626,I met a couple today that lost their way.
00:36:54.754,00:37:02.470,"They loved each other, but by the time they remembered what really mattered, it was too late."
00:37:07.225,00:37:10.269,I don't want us to be like them.
00:37:25.952,00:37:30.874,"There's a surgery I could have that should make me fertile, but there's a risk of impotency."
00:37:35.087,00:37:37.005,What do you want to do?
00:37:37.047,00:37:39.507,"I want to give you what you want, what we want, a family."
00:37:41.342,00:37:43.053,We are a family.
00:37:43.887,00:37:51.310,"Yes, I want children, and there are many ways to do that, which we'll explore together."
00:37:51.352,00:37:54.272,But I draw the line at anything that risks our sex life.
00:38:05.158,00:38:09.788,"It's just one night a week, but I think this could be my big break, you know?"
00:38:09.829,00:38:11.164,"Well, you always had a beautiful voice."
00:38:15.418,00:38:17.503,But enough about me.
00:38:20.339,00:38:22.425,I did.
00:38:22.467,00:38:26.221,Pretty young thing should have plenty of choices.
00:38:26.263,00:38:28.140,"Hmm, I'm not looking to complicate my life right now."
00:38:30.391,00:38:35.647,"Still looking after everyone else but yourself, like you did for me."
00:38:37.690,00:38:43.155,"where nobody hides You know, I know brag to everyone."
00:38:43.196,00:38:44.948,My baby.
00:38:44.990,00:38:46.741,Surgical resident.
00:38:46.783,00:38:47.993,"Right, sorry."
00:38:49.202,00:38:50.453,You like it?
00:38:52.872,00:38:55.041,I love it.
00:39:00.630,00:39:02.674,Yeah.
00:39:02.715,00:39:04.342,I'd like to be closer to you.
00:39:08.805,00:39:10.723,I found a place.
00:39:11.975,00:39:17.230,"You'd like it, but I just need to put up first and last."
00:39:20.775,00:39:22.068,I'll pay you back.
00:39:27.240,00:39:28.658,How much do you need?
00:39:28.700,00:39:30.743,"$2,500."
00:39:30.785,00:39:33.746,"Plus I have to get furniture and, you know, all of that."
00:39:33.788,00:39:35.414,I thought maybe you could help me pick that stuff out.
00:39:35.456,00:39:36.875,You've always been so good at that.
00:39:36.916,00:39:38.501,I really appreciate it.
00:40:06.487,00:40:12.785,"where nobody hides KENNY: Uh, Celeste isn't coming."
00:40:12.827,00:40:15.372,I hate her.
00:40:15.413,00:40:18.708,But I'm not gonna let that ruin our night.
00:40:18.750,00:40:20.126,That's what friends are for.
00:40:20.168,00:40:22.670,"They got each other's backs, rain or shine."
00:40:22.712,00:40:27.633,"By the by, I found a $20 in your battery drawer, so I got us Chinese food."
00:40:30.720,00:40:31.971,"Aw, come on now."
00:40:32.013,00:40:34.599,"Trust me, everybody likes Ma Jong's Kung Pao."
00:40:34.640,00:40:41.147,where nobody hides There you go.
00:40:41.189,00:40:44.109,I'm pretty torn up about that Celeste thing.
00:40:44.150,00:40:46.194,You said you hated Celeste.
00:40:46.236,00:40:47.820,I do.
00:40:51.074,00:40:52.575,This tastes terrible.
00:40:52.617,00:40:55.412,"Okay, then he hates Chinese food."
00:40:55.453,00:40:57.080,More for me.
00:40:57.122,00:40:58.456,Plain white rice?
00:41:02.085,00:41:05.463,"Oh, uh, I got a gaming console, and I hooked it up to your bad boy over there."
00:41:05.504,00:41:06.798,We can play some Mortal Kombat.
00:41:09.175,00:41:10.468,Come on.
00:41:15.098,00:41:17.183,We doing this or what?
00:41:18.393,00:41:19.811,It sounds fun.
00:41:25.066,00:41:26.401,"Yeah, there you go."
00:41:30.155,00:41:32.407,That's you on the left right there.
00:41:32.449,00:41:34.367,Okay.
00:41:34.409,00:41:38.204,"You got four arms, but you're naked, so here we go."
00:41:40.581,00:41:42.417,"KENNY: Ah, I didn't realize how bloody this game was."
00:41:42.459,00:41:44.043,"Ooh, a fireball."
00:41:45.295,00:41:46.587,Have you played this before?
00:41:46.629,00:41:49.924,SHAUN: That looks like a spinal fracture.
00:41:49.966,00:41:51.926,"KENNY: Yeah, I'd say..."
00:41:51.968,00:41:53.345,SHAUN: You died.
00:00:30.155,00:00:31.782,MAN: The timing was good.
00:00:36.036,00:00:37.830,We're gonna start a whole new life.
00:00:37.872,00:00:39.206,It's very exciting.
00:00:39.247,00:00:41.458,"In college, my dad majored in cheerleading."
00:00:44.670,00:00:45.963,That was a joke.
00:00:46.005,00:00:47.798,Gretchen's got a great sense of humor.
00:00:47.840,00:00:50.091,I'm laughing on the inside.
00:00:52.386,00:00:53.679,Dr. Park.
00:00:53.721,00:00:58.475,Moebius syndrome is a paralysis of the sixth and seventh pair of cranial nerves.
00:00:58.517,00:01:01.102,The seventh pair controls facial expression.
00:01:01.144,00:01:04.523,"Luckily, in Gretchen's case, we haven't found any limitation to the sixth pair."
00:01:04.565,00:01:06.358,I'm a lucky girl.
00:01:06.400,00:01:11.989,"We'll be taking two slivers of muscle from your thighs, along with their nerves and blood supply, and transplanting them into your cheeks."
00:01:12.031,00:01:16.744,"There'll be considerable recovery time before you'll be able to smile at will, maybe three months."
00:01:18.119,00:01:20.080,"So, what do you say?"
00:01:21.623,00:01:22.666,Can I sleep on it?
00:01:27.880,00:01:31.466,"Sorry, Dr. Andrews."
00:01:34.219,00:01:35.804,Do you want to be a comedian?
00:02:04.959,00:02:07.294,I apologize for Dr. Murphy.
00:02:12.257,00:02:18.179,We are required to have an honest risk/benefit discussion with our patients.
00:02:18.221,00:02:20.474,We are giving a lovely young girl a smile.
00:02:20.515,00:02:21.642,That's a simple equation.
00:02:21.683,00:02:24.352,"Well, it's more than the smile or the jokes."
00:02:24.394,00:02:27.188,She can't express any emotions at all.
00:02:27.230,00:02:33.612,"No one can tell if she's happy or sad or scared, anything."
00:02:33.654,00:02:35.864,She's never had much of a social life.
00:02:35.906,00:02:39.493,"Ever since her mother died, she's been completely withdrawn."
00:02:55.216,00:02:57.970,Lucy has a post-op infection of unknown origin.
00:02:58.012,00:03:00.722,Infusing 900 milligrams of clindamycin.
00:03:00.764,00:03:01.682,"It's terrible, isn't it?"
00:03:02.641,00:03:03.851,"Yes, it is."
00:03:03.892,00:03:05.019,Have you been changing your dressing?
00:03:05.060,00:03:06.103,Every day.
00:03:06.145,00:03:08.355,"Soaking it in clean, warm water?"
00:03:08.396,00:03:10.231,"Taking your antibiotics, one pill, three times a day?"
00:03:11.692,00:03:12.860,That's a no.
00:03:14.402,00:03:18.281,"Lucy, I know I gave you a scrip for antibiotics, along with one for pain meds."
00:03:21.451,00:03:23.704,"Did you have a bad reaction to them, or..."
00:03:28.291,00:03:35.799,"I didn't think it was necessary until it got really bad, and then I was too weak to go myself, and I didn't have anyone to pick it up for me."
00:03:35.841,00:03:37.217,Okay. Mystery solved.
00:03:39.845,00:03:42.263,I'm sorry.
00:03:42.305,00:03:43.431,Very stupid.
00:03:56.737,00:03:57.905,Okay.
00:03:58.906,00:04:00.074,"Hey, Shaun."
00:04:01.742,00:04:03.326,Oh. Hello.
00:04:03.368,00:04:05.704,I haven't seen you in ages.
00:04:06.830,00:04:08.623,I'm buying an apple.
00:04:08.665,00:04:10.667,I can see that.
00:04:10.709,00:04:12.252,"No, thank you."
00:04:12.293,00:04:13.712,"Thank you, Shaun."
00:04:13.754,00:04:15.089,What else is new?
00:04:18.258,00:04:22.554,"Um, yeah, no, I..."
00:04:22.596,00:04:26.141,"Whatever we are, we can still talk."
00:04:26.183,00:04:28.227,I have a new friend.
00:04:28.268,00:04:29.644,Here you go.
00:04:29.686,00:04:31.188,"Thank you, Debbie."
00:04:31.230,00:04:33.732,"Kenny, huh?"
00:04:33.774,00:04:35.067,Do you have a new friend?
00:04:38.904,00:04:40.114,SHAUN: Okay.
00:04:40.155,00:04:41.322,Thank you.
00:04:41.364,00:04:43.158,We can talk.
00:04:43.200,00:04:45.577,"You know, we can talk about sports, we can talk about weather, we can talk about..."
00:04:45.619,00:04:47.328,Debbie?
00:04:47.370,00:04:48.371,Why would you want to talk about Debbie?
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.082,Debbie was flirting with you.
00:04:55.963,00:04:59.258,"No, not the trifecta, and one atypical sign."
00:04:59.299,00:05:00.717,I think she's just trying to be friendly.
00:05:00.759,00:05:02.970,She gave you an extra dollar in change.
00:05:05.222,00:05:07.975,"And the fact that you didn't notice means you like her, too."
00:05:11.019,00:05:13.147,Maybe she's just bad at math.
00:05:20.654,00:05:23.615,My dad said that you're on the spectrum.
00:05:23.657,00:05:26.118,That's why you said that about people getting my jokes.
00:05:26.160,00:05:28.328,People always get my jokes.
00:05:29.037,00:05:30.164,Then you're very lucky.
00:05:32.415,00:05:33.333,That was a joke.
00:05:34.793,00:05:35.669,I see what you did there.
00:05:36.503,00:05:37.378,Yes.
00:05:40.339,00:05:43.468,They call me Resting Gretch Face.
00:05:46.221,00:05:47.722,Shaun the Moron.
00:05:50.558,00:05:54.229,Not very witty.
00:05:54.271,00:05:56.355,I drew this to their attention.
00:06:00.277,00:06:01.528,"I'm on a spectrum, too."
00:06:04.072,00:06:07.366,"Somewhere between inscrutable, unapproachable, and..."
00:06:09.077,00:06:10.829,Actively scorned.
00:06:10.871,00:06:17.460,"I don't want to be more approachable, and I prefer people not reading my emotions."
00:06:17.502,00:06:19.254,They're mine.
00:06:30.182,00:06:32.600,You really think this surgery's too risky?
00:06:32.642,00:06:39.398,"Possible complications include embolism, hemorrhage, collateral paralysis, asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke."
00:06:42.819,00:06:46.198,It's also expensive and medically unnecessary.
00:06:47.908,00:06:49.617,"Okay, look straight ahead."
00:06:52.787,00:06:55.665,"There's a two-hour wait in the E.R., and what are we doing?"
00:06:55.707,00:06:58.626,Treating a woman because she willfully ignored doctors' orders.
00:06:58.668,00:07:01.504,"I know what a parasite looks like, and it's not Lucy."
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.382,So this is a Mom thing with you.
00:07:07.552,00:07:11.056,"And that is the sole upside to my miserable childhood, thank you."
00:07:11.098,00:07:12.766,"Well, at least you had a mom."
00:07:17.854,00:07:19.480,"Morgan, I'm sorry."
00:07:19.522,00:07:20.941,I didn't tell you to get sympathy.
00:07:20.982,00:07:22.442,"Just that I know parasites, too."
00:07:30.575,00:07:31.993,Got you booked first thing tomorrow morning.
00:07:33.578,00:07:34.704,Dad.
00:07:34.746,00:07:35.914,What? Too soon?
00:07:35.956,00:07:37.207,It's...
00:07:37.249,00:07:40.794,You're nervous.
00:07:40.835,00:07:43.213,"If you have any more questions, feel free."
00:07:45.382,00:07:46.466,I've changed my mind.
00:07:49.844,00:07:51.138,I'm not having the surgery.
00:08:01.982,00:08:03.150,Murphy.
00:08:07.612,00:08:08.529,Hello.
00:08:11.325,00:08:14.077,Gretchen's father is very upset.
00:08:14.119,00:08:15.870,It seems you talked her out of the surgery.
00:08:15.912,00:08:19.082,"No, I didn't talk her out of it or talk her anywhere."
00:08:19.124,00:08:21.835,I just gave her the list of potential risks.
00:08:21.876,00:08:26.089,"Embolism, hemorrhage, collateral paralysis, asymmetry, brain damage, and stroke."
00:08:26.131,00:08:27.466,Stroke?
00:08:27.507,00:08:31.552,"Yes, there was a case in Brazil in 2004, and the patient suffer..."
00:08:33.638,00:08:38.601,It seems that you don't believe that restoring this girl's smile is that important.
00:08:38.643,00:08:40.937,Smiles are overvalued.
00:08:40.979,00:08:42.439,There are studies that support that.
00:08:42.481,00:08:43.898,And there are studies that don't.
00:08:45.108,00:08:47.319,"When we smile, we produce endorphins."
00:08:47.361,00:08:49.654,They make us happy.
00:08:49.696,00:08:54.784,"When we see smiles, our basotemporal lobes are activated, and we duplicate what we see."
00:08:54.826,00:08:56.536,"Murphy, smiles are contagious."
00:08:57.871,00:08:58.997,You see?
00:08:59.831,00:09:02.876,"I feel good, you feel good."
00:09:02.917,00:09:04.002,Everybody likes smiles.
00:09:08.173,00:09:09.632,I don't.
00:09:09.674,00:09:14.929,"In any case, your smile wasn't sincere since it didn't demonstrate the Duchenne Marker."
00:09:14.971,00:09:20.685,"There was no involvement of the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes, which means you didn't release endorphins."
00:09:22.229,00:09:29.861,"You know, if you can talk her out of a surgery she's wanted for years, I'm pretty sure a conversation with someone objective can talk her back into it."
00:09:29.903,00:09:32.572,"Get Park, come with, and keep quiet."
00:09:39.871,00:09:41.039,Dr. Kalu.
00:09:42.123,00:09:43.250,Remember me?
00:09:45.377,00:09:47.837,"Uh, hi. Celez. Hi."
00:09:47.879,00:09:50.631,"Yes, uh, of course I do."
00:09:50.673,00:09:52.175,I hope it's okay that I requested you.
00:09:52.217,00:09:53.468,I'm glad you did.
00:09:54.635,00:09:55.887,How are you doing?
00:09:55.929,00:09:58.056,"Oh, that's what you're going to tell me."
00:10:04.521,00:10:06.981,I'm getting really tired of being followed home by stray cats.
00:10:08.275,00:10:09.609,How's the pain?
00:10:11.694,00:10:12.612,Nothing.
00:10:14.822,00:10:17.700,"Uh, any... any fever, itchiness, or swelling?"
00:10:17.742,00:10:18.659,Nope.
00:10:18.701,00:10:19.953,"Well, it looks very good."
00:10:19.994,00:10:21.162,But?
00:10:22.789,00:10:23.706,How much longer?
00:10:24.832,00:10:28.628,"Um, how do you feel about tomorrow?"
00:10:38.472,00:10:40.432,What's the matter?
00:10:44.102,00:10:45.270,I...
00:10:48.356,00:10:49.941,I'm afraid of how I'm going to look.
00:10:52.193,00:10:53.278,You're going to look beautiful.
00:10:57.949,00:10:58.866,Tomorrow.
00:11:00.827,00:11:07.917,"I know Dr. Murphy informed you about the risks of this surgery, and some risks are significant and some just aren't."
00:11:07.959,00:11:11.712,This is as close to risk-free surgery as we can get.
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.715,"It'll give you a smile, it'll let you laugh."
00:11:14.757,00:11:16.259,GRETCHEN: No.
00:11:21.306,00:11:22.390,He inspired me.
00:11:25.977,00:11:28.522,He helped me realize that this could actually make me stronger.
00:11:30.857,00:11:32.317,I don't want to run from it anymore.
00:11:43.244,00:11:44.496,"Yeah, she's lying."
00:11:45.788,00:11:51.169,"She's a smart, sarcastic young woman, not exactly someone who's prone to inspirational stories."
00:11:51.211,00:11:52.420,Why would she lie about changing her mind?
00:11:52.462,00:11:57.716,"Well, when I was a cop, I had a lot of people change their minds about testifying in court, and it always came down to one of three reasons."
00:12:01.638,00:12:02.681,She doesn't seem confused.
00:12:02.721,00:12:04.057,And I don't think she's afraid.
00:12:04.098,00:12:06.309,So Gretchen was paid off?
00:12:06.351,00:12:08.936,I admit the analogy isn't perfect.
00:12:08.978,00:12:10.938,It's close enough.
00:12:20.073,00:12:22.825,Guess who's back in the E.R.
00:12:22.867,00:12:26.204,"You're happy, so I'm guessing it's a non-compliant patient."
00:12:26.913,00:12:28.665,You misjudged Lucy.
00:12:28.707,00:12:31.585,She made an honest mistake forgetting her prescriptions.
00:12:37.215,00:12:39.342,"Is that a Mom thing, too?"
00:12:44.013,00:12:45.848,The insurance company is paying for it.
00:12:47.517,00:12:48.643,Dad...
00:12:49.561,00:12:50.729,I know it isn't.
00:12:51.229,00:12:52.439,It's elective.
00:12:53.440,00:12:54.815,It's medically unnecessary.
00:12:56.150,00:12:59.320,No one can put a value on your smile.
00:12:59.362,00:13:02.532,"Not bullies, not an insurance company, not even Dr. Murphy."
00:13:04.409,00:13:07.662,"In my opinion, this surgery's medically necessary."
00:13:13.710,00:13:15.044,"Gretchen, sweetie..."
00:13:16.671,00:13:21.800,My first memory of your mother was of her smiling at me from across the room.
00:13:23.094,00:13:26.805,"And because of that smile, we ended up with you."
00:13:39.569,00:13:45.866,"I mean, we never had much money, but as long as I had that smile, it didn't matter."
00:13:52.206,00:13:53.124,"I love you, Dad."
00:13:55.876,00:13:58.755,And that's why I can't let you give up everything for this.
00:14:11.142,00:14:12.644,Lucy Callard?
00:14:12.686,00:14:13.812,LUCY: I'm here.
00:14:16.606,00:14:19.859,"Um, Lucille Elizabeth Callard?"
00:14:20.360,00:14:21.902,"Yes, that's me."
00:14:31.329,00:14:34.207,"MORGAN: You're the victim of identity theft, Lucy."
00:14:34.248,00:14:37.043,There's an impostor using your name and medical ID to get benefits.
00:14:37.084,00:14:38.753,Did you have your purse stolen recently?
00:14:38.795,00:14:40.547,Six weeks ago.
00:14:46.010,00:14:49.556,Is this why the pharmacy refuses to fill my prescriptions?
00:14:49.597,00:14:51.766,I'm on pain meds for post-herpetic neuralgia.
00:14:54.561,00:14:59.357,"Once the impostor filled her prescription for pain meds, the pharmacy must have thought you were overfilling opiates."
00:15:00.859,00:15:02.985,It always flares up when I get upset.
00:15:03.027,00:15:05.905,"Don't worry, Lucy, we'll get you your meds."
00:15:13.413,00:15:15.331,We... We can't.
00:15:15.373,00:15:17.542,We're already treating Lucy Callard.
00:15:23.256,00:15:24.298,"Nice game, Tony."
00:15:24.340,00:15:25.675,"Hi, Jim."
00:15:25.717,00:15:27.343,"Marcus, hey."
00:15:28.595,00:15:30.221,15-year-old girl with Moebius Syndrome.
00:15:30.263,00:15:32.265,Your company denied coverage.
00:15:34.141,00:15:37.562,"No respiratory issues, deformities, pain, she doesn't even drool."
00:15:37.604,00:15:38.855,She's fully functional.
00:15:42.108,00:15:48.281,"Marcus, I think it's wonderful you want to give this little girl her smile, but if we pay for everything wonderful, we'll go bankrupt, huh?"
00:15:48.322,00:15:49.866,And then who are we helping?
00:15:49.908,00:15:52.952,We all know doctors cheat diagnoses to get coverage.
00:15:52.993,00:15:55.996,"Deviated septum gets you a free nose job, migraine gets you Botox."
00:15:56.038,00:15:57.624,Do you really want me to play that game?
00:16:01.127,00:16:03.713,We're a reputable company with very high standards.
00:16:03.755,00:16:06.215,Very high bonuses that get even higher with your denial rate.
00:16:06.257,00:16:11.763,"I was gonna suggest we end this before we say something we'll regret, but I believe that just happened."
00:16:12.931,00:16:17.101,"Gretchen's socially isolated, depressed, and that's only gonna get worse."
00:16:17.143,00:16:18.645,What if she slashes her wrists?
00:16:18.686,00:16:20.062,You'd prefer to cover that?
00:16:22.064,00:16:27.654,"And God forbid something does happen to her, 'cause I'll make sure that this conversation's part of the permanent record."
00:16:40.959,00:16:45.379,"Dr. Andrews said smiles are contagious, and I'm testing that hypothesis."
00:16:46.840,00:16:49.008,"Well, I'm not sure your study will prove anything."
00:16:49.049,00:16:51.928,It might have something to do with the lack of the Duchenne Marker.
00:16:53.930,00:16:55.014,But here you go.
00:16:58.518,00:17:00.269,That wasn't a smile.
00:17:00.311,00:17:01.187,Sure it was.
00:17:04.899,00:17:06.985,I want to show you something.
00:17:17.411,00:17:19.038,You need to follow me.
00:17:20.039,00:17:21.040,Okay.
00:17:23.250,00:17:25.545,The impostor has poisoned the real Lucy's medical record.
00:17:25.586,00:17:29.757,"We have to go through every medication, every notation, every test to determine whose is whose."
00:17:29.799,00:17:33.011,Doing that with zero tolerance for errors could take six months.
00:17:33.052,00:17:35.221,"Well, the paperwork is our problem, not hers."
00:17:35.262,00:17:38.516,Not if the confusion results in a harmful treatment or incorrect diagnosis.
00:17:38.558,00:17:39.934,"Well, we have to do something."
00:17:39.976,00:17:42.102,This woman is in serious pain.
00:17:42.144,00:17:45.023,So we treat her.
00:17:48.359,00:17:49.944,MAN: Shaun.
00:17:49.986,00:17:51.905,"Shaun, I've already had two iced coffees..."
00:17:51.946,00:17:53.907,"Debbie. Hello, Debbie."
00:17:53.948,00:17:56.242,Shaun...
00:17:56.283,00:17:57.159,"Oh, my God."
00:17:58.619,00:18:01.330,"'Cause I have a new friend, and he needs one, too."
00:18:01.372,00:18:03.457,I'm so sorry.
00:18:01.372,00:18:09.213,"Look, Dr. Glassman, Debbie's facial proportions are close to optimal, okay, .38 vertical and .48 horizontal..."
00:18:09.255,00:18:10.256,I'm so sorry.
00:18:10.297,00:18:11.674,...so you should find her attractive.
00:18:11.716,00:18:12.967,Thank you?
00:18:14.761,00:18:16.387,And I think you're both Jewish.
00:18:18.848,00:18:22.894,Tribal commonality is highly conducive to social bonding.
00:18:30.526,00:18:32.361,Shalom?
00:18:32.403,00:18:38.910,"Bullies can't put a value on your smile, nor can Dr. Murphy, but it seems the insurance company can."
00:18:38.952,00:18:44.582,"They've agreed to pay $43,750, about 85% of the entire cost."
00:18:47.001,00:18:48.127,I can cover the rest of that.
00:18:49.420,00:18:51.171,I swear.
00:18:51.213,00:18:55.134,"Oh, sweetie, please, let me do this for you."
00:19:01.641,00:19:02.767,Okay.
00:19:10.190,00:19:11.484,Jane Doe?
00:19:11.525,00:19:12.902,That's the only way that we can treat you right now.
00:19:14.570,00:19:16.823,The records department will call you to sort all this out.
00:19:19.158,00:19:21.119,"A year ago, I was playing tennis."
00:19:22.286,00:19:28.334,"And then the shingles hit, and I was laid up for six weeks, and I've been on pain meds ever since."
00:19:28.375,00:19:34.423,"I lost my job, my husband treats me like I'm an old lady, and my daughter thinks I'm too medicated to be around the new baby."
00:19:48.729,00:19:50.230,The impostor returns.
00:19:59.365,00:20:01.408,Lucy?
00:20:03.619,00:20:04.829,Lucy?
00:20:04.871,00:20:07.623,She's in septic shock.
00:20:07.665,00:20:10.918,"Order a lactate level, blood cultures, and a broad-spectrum antibiotic."
00:20:10.960,00:20:13.212,I'll tell Melendez we've initiated Sepsis Protocol.
00:20:13.253,00:20:14.505,MORGAN: We should report her.
00:20:14.547,00:20:15.923,She's a criminal and a flight risk.
00:20:15.965,00:20:17.133,"CLAIRE: And very, very sick."
00:20:17.175,00:20:20.219,We should put someone outside her door and arrest her when she's stable.
00:20:20.260,00:20:24.182,We don't report patients we find with drugs or non-violent people with guns.
00:20:24.223,00:20:26.517,We do report people who steal from us.
00:20:26.559,00:20:30.813,What would happen if people who needed our help thought they would be arrested?
00:20:30.855,00:20:34.150,"If they thought they would be arrested for stealing an ID, maybe they wouldn't steal an ID."
00:20:34.192,00:20:38.154,I don't remember anything in the Hippocratic Oath about checking payor sources before treatment.
00:20:38.196,00:20:41.908,"Strongly suggesting there was no health insurance in 4th century B.C., Greece."
00:20:44.827,00:20:48.915,"We have a duty to treat, and we have the right to get paid."
00:20:50.166,00:20:52.292,But first things first.
00:20:59.759,00:21:02.344,Maintain the pretense.
00:21:08.392,00:21:11.229,"ANDREWS: Dr. Park, pull the muscle, please."
00:21:11.270,00:21:14.065,We don't want any excess gathering in the suture line.
00:21:16.609,00:21:17.902,Thank you.
00:21:17.944,00:21:20.154,"Okay, remove retractors."
00:21:25.034,00:21:26.202,Ready?
00:21:33.751,00:21:35.628,Are you sure you don't want something for the pain?
00:21:35.669,00:21:38.881,"No. No, I'm good, as long as you keep talking to me."
00:21:45.888,00:21:47.306,Okay...
00:21:59.860,00:22:00.820,That kind of painful?
00:22:02.155,00:22:04.323,You may have to dig even deeper than that.
00:22:07.743,00:22:15.001,How about the time I finally found myself in the perfect situation?
00:22:16.836,00:22:24.177,"You know, work, friends, future, something I never really had before."
00:22:26.595,00:22:28.181,Maybe that's why I screwed it up.
00:22:32.059,00:22:34.728,You're not responding to the antibiotics like we'd hoped...
00:22:36.480,00:22:37.397,Lucy.
00:22:38.899,00:22:39.817,"You know, don't you?"
00:22:47.241,00:22:48.701,Is there anyone we can contact?
00:22:50.828,00:22:51.871,Do you have any children?
00:22:55.415,00:22:57.293,But he'd be so ashamed of me.
00:22:58.127,00:22:59.212,Where is he?
00:22:59.253,00:23:00.671,College...
00:23:00.713,00:23:01.881,First one in our family.
00:23:03.216,00:23:06.760,I had to choose between premiums and tuition.
00:23:08.637,00:23:10.973,Your son is very lucky to have such a loving mother.
00:23:18.396,00:23:20.191,I didn't get either medication.
00:23:21.108,00:23:23.277,Are you sure?
00:23:23.319,00:23:26.197,Because the real Lucy was having problems with the pharmacy.
00:23:26.239,00:23:28.782,I didn't want to risk using the card again.
00:23:29.491,00:23:30.576,Is she okay?
00:23:37.750,00:23:43.881,"Maybe it's time to move on, take the lesson with you, find new friends."
00:23:43.923,00:23:45.674,I went to Denver for an interview last week.
00:23:47.343,00:23:48.426,And?
00:23:57.186,00:23:58.312,Take a look.
00:24:00.231,00:24:01.648,"Hey, trust me."
00:24:19.875,00:24:22.878,"The kid, college, it's just a convenient sob story."
00:24:27.341,00:24:30.719,"Here's what we don't know about fake Lucy, whether her story is true."
00:24:30.761,00:24:32.012,Here's what we do know.
00:24:32.054,00:24:34.514,She's a liar who just found out she's busted.
00:24:39.937,00:24:46.693,"According to Dr. Spindler at Santa Clara General, she had it the year before, too, and according to Dr. Millhouse at SF Muni, the year before that."
00:24:49.363,00:24:51.740,She wasn't denied the pain meds because of our impostor.
00:24:51.782,00:24:55.035,She was denied because she is a garden-variety addict.
00:24:56.162,00:24:57.495,"Well-played, sir."
00:25:07.298,00:25:09.300,Dr. Park says the surgery went well.
00:25:14.180,00:25:16.890,She should be breathing on her own by now.
00:25:16.932,00:25:21.145,"Even after prolonged anesthesia, it should only take 60 to 90 minutes."
00:25:27.067,00:25:28.444,Is she okay?
00:25:28.486,00:25:34.658,"She should have protective airway reflexes, motor activity, and a return of consciousness."
00:25:36.952,00:25:39.038,"I need to page Dr. Andrews, STAT."
00:25:39.079,00:25:40.498,What's going on?
00:25:40.538,00:25:42.124,Something bad.
00:25:55.346,00:25:57.223,It doesn't leave much.
00:25:57.264,00:26:05.105,"Uh, she maintained normal oxygen, as well as end tidal CO2 throughout the entire case, and we've given reversal agents, which we will repeat."
00:26:06.273,00:26:07.525,Do you feel bad?
00:26:10.861,00:26:12.488,It's okay.
00:26:12.530,00:26:15.449,You told them it was close to risk-free.
00:26:15.491,00:26:17.910,"They knew there were risks, and I told them, too."
00:26:19.745,00:26:23.581,Get a CT.
00:26:37.346,00:26:40.433,"WBCs and lactate are rising, O2 sat and MAP are falling."
00:26:40.474,00:26:42.059,The Sepsis Protocol isn't working.
00:26:44.728,00:26:50.025,"Another antibiotic, ah, continue crystalloids, increase her vasopressors?"
00:26:50.067,00:26:53.112,"Give 'em all at try, and intubate her and insert a swan."
00:26:53.153,00:26:54.947,"And, yes, I understand this is out of our own pocket."
00:27:11.505,00:27:15.092,"Um, do anything exciting for Purim?"
00:27:15.134,00:27:17.303,"Purim. Uh, no."
00:27:17.344,00:27:18.678,"Yeah, you know, the usual."
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.055,Mmm.
00:27:20.097,00:27:29.689,"Ate a little matzah, and celebrated our exodus from slavery, which I think is Passover and not Purim."
00:27:31.942,00:27:37.531,"The truth of the matter is, I'm only half Jewish, so only half the knowledge."
00:27:37.573,00:27:40.700,The truth is I-I'm not Jewish at all.
00:27:42.202,00:27:43.703,Ah.
00:27:43.745,00:27:46.373,"Yeah, my first husband was."
00:27:54.047,00:27:56.216,"You know what, Debbie?"
00:27:57.301,00:27:58.802,"Okay. Well, it was..."
00:28:02.389,00:28:03.807,Same.
00:28:06.726,00:28:08.937,"Oh, no, look at that!"
00:28:10.314,00:28:17.029,"A 1975 300D, one of the most perfect Mercedes ever just got a little less perfect."
00:28:17.070,00:28:19.739,I beg to differ.
00:28:17.070,00:28:23.202,"If you're looking for perfection, you look no further than the 1967 280SE."
00:28:23.243,00:28:24.411,Cabriolet or coupe?
00:28:26.205,00:28:31.418,"Well, an owner of a 300SL Gullwing might argue otherwise."
00:28:31.460,00:28:33.086,A Gullwing?
00:28:34.338,00:28:36.714,Can I get you another coffee?
00:28:38.008,00:28:39.092,Yeah.
00:28:40.177,00:28:41.428,"Iced, large, black."
00:28:41.470,00:28:42.929,That's it.
00:29:00.197,00:29:02.741,"That's a little bit unsettling, Murphy."
00:29:05.035,00:29:06.161,Okay.
00:29:10.207,00:29:14.461,Why are you studying the current of ions during electrolysis?
00:29:14.503,00:29:16.589,"Uh, it's not the chemical kind of transference."
00:29:18.131,00:29:19.049,It's the doctor-patient kind.
00:29:22.802,00:29:27.349,I don't think the Internet is very helpful for solving personal situations.
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.476,True.
00:29:29.518,00:29:33.606,"But I can't exactly ask Claire for her advice, and I barely know Park, and Morgan..."
00:29:33.647,00:29:34.856,Morgan would be bad.
00:29:42.489,00:29:43.616,I'm a person.
00:29:45.743,00:29:47.620,"Yeah. No, no."
00:29:47.661,00:29:49.371,"I'd, uh, I'd love your advice."
00:29:49.829,00:29:50.789,Okay.
00:29:52.040,00:29:58.338,"Uh, so I think Celez, my burn patient, has feelings for me, and I..."
00:29:58.380,00:30:00.799,"...may have feelings for her, too."
00:30:02.884,00:30:08.557,"But there's a good chance her feelings aren't real, and if they are real, then they may not be permanent."
00:30:11.977,00:30:14.438,"Uh, you know, it's kind of textbook transference."
00:30:19.318,00:30:23.363,And all I've ever known in my life is unrequited love...
00:30:27.785,00:30:31.371,...from Claire and from my parents.
00:30:34.916,00:30:36.502,"And that makes me vulnerable, too."
00:30:47.471,00:30:48.597,You should call in sick.
00:30:52.184,00:30:57.690,Lea says calling in sick is all you need to gain superior wisdom and knowledge.
00:30:58.357,00:30:59.525,She was right.
00:31:17.167,00:31:18.918,So what else could it be?
00:31:18.960,00:31:23.089,"Anoxic brain injury, a complication of anesthesia."
00:31:25.175,00:31:27.803,"Unfortunately, we believe..."
00:31:27.845,00:31:29.179,...your daughter is brain-dead.
00:31:33.308,00:31:34.476,What?
00:31:44.903,00:31:45.904,All for a smile.
00:31:48.532,00:31:50.909,I made her think she wasn't good enough the way she was.
00:31:54.788,00:31:55.914,I should've listened to you.
00:31:58.500,00:32:01.127,There's just no predicting how individuals will react to anesthesia.
00:32:01.712,00:32:02.880,Yeah.
00:32:13.181,00:32:17.477,The last thing a grieving family member needs is to see their doctor tap out.
00:32:17.519,00:32:20.522,Maybe she's still under anesthesia.
00:32:22.775,00:32:24.317,Succinylcholine.
00:32:24.359,00:32:26.319,It was one of the anesthetics Gretchen was administered.
00:32:26.361,00:32:27.905,Yeah.
00:32:26.361,00:32:30.365,"Now, what if she has a Plasma Cholinesterase Deficiency?"
00:32:32.701,00:32:34.870,Complete deficiency is extremely rare.
00:32:34.912,00:32:37.873,"I've never personally seen it, and I don't know anyone who has."
00:32:37.915,00:32:41.000,"Yeah, but if she does have it, she's just gonna wake up."
00:32:45.547,00:32:47.006,Should I tell the father?
00:32:48.508,00:32:49.968,No way we're letting him grieve twice.
00:32:54.556,00:32:56.725,Your labs are not improving.
00:32:56.767,00:32:58.143,Your organs are shutting down.
00:32:59.686,00:33:00.979,You're running out of time.
00:33:03.899,00:33:05.943,I'd like to stop calling you Lucy.
00:33:35.889,00:33:37.015,What are you doing?
00:33:38.224,00:33:39.392,Corneal reflex.
00:33:43.062,00:33:46.566,It's mediated by the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic branch.
00:33:55.158,00:33:56.660,What does it mean?
00:33:56.702,00:33:57.828,It means we were wrong.
00:33:59.412,00:34:00.413,She's gonna be just fine.
00:34:12.300,00:34:13.218,"Thank you, Dr. Murphy."
00:34:22.561,00:34:24.396,you're gonna be okay.
00:34:24.437,00:34:26.732,You're gonna be just fine.
00:34:26.773,00:34:32.404,"I was drawing a bath, and I leaned over to turn it off, and I dropped the pill bottle, and before I could fish it out..."
00:34:32.445,00:34:35.073,All the pills were ruined.
00:34:35.114,00:34:37.034,My pain has made me so clumsy.
00:34:37.784,00:34:42.748,"Lucy, you're a liar and a cheat and an addict."
00:34:45.709,00:34:49.963,"We know about the frequent prescriptions, the multiple doctors, and the ever-recurring shingles."
00:34:53.508,00:34:55.510,You have a serious medical problem.
00:35:09.691,00:35:14.237,But we might be able to give you a pretty good idea of what you're gonna look like.
00:35:14.279,00:35:16.322,Those things by your ears are neuro-stimulators.
00:35:16.364,00:35:18.951,"When we activate them, instant smile."
00:35:20.159,00:35:21.119,Sound good?
00:35:23.288,00:35:24.163,Dr. Murphy.
00:35:37.135,00:35:39.012,It's your mother's smile.
00:35:39.054,00:35:40.555,She seemed like a good template.
00:35:43.976,00:35:46.352,There is no Duchenne Marker.
00:35:47.646,00:35:49.106,Her smile is not real.
00:35:54.444,00:35:56.195,Thank you. Thank you.
00:36:05.998,00:36:07.958,All the other ones are.
00:36:08.875,00:36:13.171,"I spoke with Jim Ransler, who made it very clear that we owe him big time for this."
00:36:15.632,00:36:17.175,"Don't worry, Marcus, I can handle him."
00:36:18.760,00:36:20.846,I'm very impressed.
00:36:20.887,00:36:23.723,It was all very presidential of you.
00:36:23.765,00:36:25.142,You really went above and beyond.
00:36:27.853,00:36:29.312,I thought I was saving her life.
00:36:29.354,00:36:30.480,"Instead, I nearly ended it."
00:36:34.484,00:36:35.694,"Celez, hi."
00:36:36.820,00:36:39.531,This is the brilliant Dr. Murphy.
00:36:39.572,00:36:43.743,"He'll be assuming your care from here on, though I don't expect you'll need much."
00:36:48.331,00:36:50.625,I don't think you do.
00:36:50.667,00:36:52.711,"You see, doctors aren't allowed to date their patients."
00:36:58.466,00:36:59.634,What are you doing tomorrow?
00:37:00.510,00:37:02.220,"Uh, I'm calling in sick."
00:37:08.185,00:37:11.604,I think you may still have some friends here.
00:37:23.909,00:37:26.244,I guess there is one upside to all this.
00:37:29.039,00:37:33.459,"If she hadn't bought the stolen insurance card, the real Lucy wouldn't be in rehab right now."
00:37:36.462,00:37:38.924,Surprisingly nice.
00:37:38.965,00:37:40.466,I told her what she needed to hear to get help.
00:37:42.677,00:37:44.054,"Trust me, I get it."
00:37:44.096,00:37:45.597,"Too soft, people take advantage of you."
00:37:46.639,00:37:49.267,"But with your badass upbringing, no one messes with you."
00:37:50.769,00:37:52.353,Upsides everywhere.
00:37:52.395,00:38:04.157,"You have way more street cred than, say, someone whose mom's a Johns Hopkins cardiologist, whose dad's a pathologist, and whose parents have been happily married for 37 years."
00:38:08.078,00:38:10.288,"Coming from privilege, zero respect."
00:38:12.207,00:38:13.875,Must be really hard to overcome.
00:38:21.382,00:38:22.842,There's nothing left to save.
00:38:36.564,00:38:38.524,"Time of death, 8:14 p.m."
00:38:50.870,00:38:51.955,I'll notify her son.
00:39:02.381,00:39:44.174,"that we're tough that we're tough we'll get back up Oh, hey."
00:39:44.216,00:39:51.472,"Um, my homies decided to pop by and, uh, play some Texas Hold'em, so I'm gonna have to take a rain check on that pizza night."
00:39:51.514,00:39:54.934,"You got a 70-inch flat-screen, too."
00:39:54.976,00:39:57.729,"Uh, no."
00:39:59.605,00:40:01.649,"Makes no sense for us both to have one, right?"
00:40:01.691,00:40:04.236,Plus homies got to watch March Madness.
00:40:06.988,00:40:08.406,It's four-player Texas Hold'em.
00:40:09.824,00:40:12.369,I don't like poker anyway.
00:40:12.410,00:40:13.536,"Hey, Shaun."
00:40:15.121,00:40:23.796,"Look, you're a great guy, um, but you got a few, like, quirks, you know?"
00:40:23.838,00:40:25.631,And that...
00:40:29.177,00:40:30.553,...jive with this kind of face time.
00:40:32.972,00:40:34.015,"You get what I'm saying, right?"
00:40:38.686,00:40:40.438,"I love you, man."
00:40:51.908,00:40:55.287,I once drove a 300SL...
00:40:55.328,00:40:59.332,Thank you.
00:40:59.374,00:41:00.583,On the road?
00:41:00.625,00:41:03.962,No. For 200 feet at the Concours d'Elegance.
00:41:05.880,00:41:06.965,"The car show, you know it."
00:41:07.006,00:41:08.883,"Of course, yeah."
00:41:08.925,00:41:12.762,"This year, they're featuring a Rollston Coachwork display."
00:41:12.804,00:41:14.639,Including the Mercedes SS?
00:41:14.680,00:41:16.099,I don't know.
00:41:16.141,00:41:17.309,But we should find out.
00:41:18.684,00:41:19.602,Do you want to go?
00:41:20.937,00:41:22.105,I couldn't.
00:41:22.939,00:41:24.190,"Yeah, no, I..."
00:41:27.860,00:41:28.987,No reason.
00:41:29.028,00:41:33.532,I just... I just thought that I should make that my first response before I accepted.
00:41:38.913,00:41:40.706,Can I get you anything else?
00:41:40.748,00:41:43.501,"No, thank you."
00:41:47.630,00:41:50.258,"I'm sorry. Um, well..."
00:41:50.300,00:41:51.843,"Well, you can bring the doorstop."
00:41:56.014,00:41:57.182,Aaron?
00:41:58.266,00:41:59.434,Sorry. Um...
00:42:00.977,00:42:02.145,The thing...
00:42:05.398,00:42:07.400,The thing... The thing...
00:42:07.442,00:42:09.527,"That t-tells you how much to pay, the... The doorstop."
00:42:17.035,00:42:18.119,Could you call a...
00:42:18.161,00:42:19.037,"Can you call an ambulance, please?"
00:42:19.078,00:42:20.288,Mmm-hmm.
00:00:11.136,00:00:13.347,I want to be your friend again.
00:00:13.388,00:00:16.517,"Why... Why, Shaun?"
00:00:16.558,00:00:18.519,People need friends.
00:00:20.688,00:00:23.231,"Yeah, they do."
00:00:27.068,00:00:28.696,You wanted space.
00:00:32.533,00:00:34.910,I need a friend more than I need space.
00:00:42.793,00:00:45.504,"Well, thank you, Shaun."
00:00:47.381,00:00:50.049,You don't know how much it means to me to hear you say that.
00:00:55.931,00:00:58.141,I think you may need a new mentor.
00:01:01.436,00:01:03.271,I'm dying.
00:01:17.536,00:01:19.413,Twelve to eighteen months.
00:01:19.454,00:01:22.708,"I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone, okay?"
00:01:22.750,00:01:24.376,I... I will in my own time.
00:01:24.418,00:01:26.587,Have you had a full work-up?
00:01:26.628,00:01:27.922,"Yes, of course."
00:01:27.963,00:01:32.760,It could be a secondary tumor metastasized to your brain from somewhere else.
00:01:34.177,00:01:36.847,It could be an inflammatory or infectious process.
00:01:36.889,00:01:38.682,"It was a tumor, Shaun."
00:01:42.185,00:01:45.731,I think that qualifies as a second opinion.
00:01:45.773,00:01:48.943,You should get a second opinion.
00:01:48.984,00:01:50.277,You have to know whether...
00:01:50.318,00:01:51.862,"All right, all right, all right, all right, Shaun."
00:01:51.904,00:01:52.988,I'll get a second opinion.
00:01:53.030,00:01:54.322,Okay?
00:01:54.364,00:01:55.490,Okay.
00:01:55.532,00:01:57.117,Can I go to work now?
00:02:01.830,00:02:03.665,"Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?"
00:02:03.707,00:02:04.917,I'm drunk.
00:02:09.254,00:02:16.303,"Uh, well, given the degree of the rotation and the fact that the break is almost compound, I'd say we're dealing with a bimalleolar or trimalleolar fracture."
00:02:16.344,00:02:17.805,Very good.
00:02:21.433,00:02:22.517,Color?
00:02:23.560,00:02:25.020,Blood flow is restricted.
00:02:25.062,00:02:26.354,His foot's dying.
00:02:26.396,00:02:28.732,"Oh, no."
00:02:28.774,00:02:31.068,I'm gonna have to reset it now.
00:02:31.110,00:02:33.403,"No, no, no, no."
00:02:33.445,00:02:35.530,This is just gonna take a second. I need you to count to three.
00:02:36.907,00:02:38.533,"One, two..."
00:02:38.575,00:02:40.410,Aah!
00:02:44.456,00:02:46.792,Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?
00:02:46.834,00:02:50.004,How long has his leg been like this and how exactly did it happen?
00:02:50.045,00:02:52.213,"Well, he's been like that since I found him."
00:02:52.255,00:02:57.094,He probably tripped over a curb or something because that's where he was.
00:03:00.305,00:03:01.932,"DR. LIM: Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery."
00:03:04.101,00:03:05.602,Don't go anywhere.
00:03:16.446,00:03:18.824,Shouldn't I be asleep for this?
00:03:18.866,00:03:26.123,"DR. MELENDEZ: Your blood alcohol level complicates anesthesia and we think you have a concussion, so we're gonna keep you responsive."
00:03:26.165,00:03:29.835,"We did give you a regional nerve block, so you shouldn't feel anything."
00:03:32.211,00:03:34.339,Huh. Cool.
00:03:34.381,00:03:36.800,DR. MELENDEZ: Bend the LCP plate over two degrees on the proximal end.
00:03:36.842,00:03:38.385,DR. PARK: Contouring pliers.
00:03:44.975,00:03:46.643,"JARED: BP is dropping, heart rate's rising."
00:03:46.685,00:03:49.063,"DR. MELENDEZ: Let's tube him. IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat."
00:03:49.104,00:03:51.773,We need to abort until we can get a handle on what else is going on.
00:03:51.815,00:03:54.359,"Give me a full body CT, full blood panels, and an echo."
00:03:54.401,00:03:56.778,DR. PARK: I think Jared and I may be able to dig up an answer quicker.
00:03:56.820,00:03:57.821,Great.
00:05:07.724,00:05:11.770,"I had a friend, a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni."
00:05:11.812,00:05:15.941,She looked at the scans.
00:05:15.983,00:05:18.318,I have an inoperable glioma.
00:05:19.319,00:05:20.904,Okay?
00:05:38.005,00:05:39.965,I need to go to work.
00:05:47.472,00:05:48.640,Be reasonable.
00:05:48.682,00:05:49.766,Beg your pardon?
00:05:49.808,00:05:51.601,Be reasonable.
00:05:51.643,00:05:54.353,I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:05:54.395,00:05:55.689,What the hell happened to Caden?
00:05:55.730,00:05:57.107,I... I don't know.
00:05:57.149,00:05:58.525,You lied to me before.
00:05:58.566,00:06:00.068,"You're lying to me now, you spoiled little coward."
00:06:00.110,00:06:04.447,"Hey, hey."
00:06:04.489,00:06:06.365,"He's scared, and you're freaking him out."
00:06:17.460,00:06:19.880,"He's angry, but he's not wrong."
00:06:19.921,00:06:22.381,"Caden's in bad shape, and we don't know why."
00:06:22.423,00:06:24.383,We need to know what happened.
00:06:27.137,00:06:28.763,"No, no, don't..."
00:06:30.974,00:06:32.475,You tell me the truth.
00:06:32.517,00:06:35.394,You won't get in trouble.
00:06:36.855,00:06:39.858,All right.
00:06:45.239,00:06:46.698,Torture?
00:06:46.740,00:06:48.491,But it's most...
00:06:53.538,00:06:55.040,And what did Caden land on?
00:06:55.082,00:06:57.334,Laundry.
00:06:57.376,00:07:04.258,"Those laundry things, as many as he could in 30 seconds."
00:07:11.932,00:07:13.474,He ate detergent.
00:07:26.654,00:07:28.031,DR. REZNICK: Let's hope he doesn't breed.
00:07:31.785,00:07:33.703,DR. MELENDEZ: We have healthy bowel attached to healthy bowel.
00:07:33.745,00:07:35.496,Let's close him up.
00:07:35.538,00:07:38.208,Dr. Melendez?
00:07:39.960,00:07:42.045,DR. MELENDEZ: Who can give me the remaining steps for closing?
00:07:42.087,00:07:44.547,"DR. REZNICK: Cut anchoring sutures, clear laps, and reposition the bowel."
00:07:44.589,00:07:51.471,"Remove clamps from the duodenal resection site, keeping clear of the underlying aorta, close the fascia using a looped O monofilament, close the dermal layer, then re-approximate the skin."
00:07:53.723,00:07:59.187,"SHAUN: Also, you need to ensure no omentum is caught in the fascial suture line."
00:08:07.112,00:08:08.696,SHAUN: Clearing laps.
00:08:11.325,00:08:16.163,I will hold the repaired segment in place while you run the bowel for me.
00:08:33.430,00:08:34.639,"Shaun, is everything all right?"
00:08:36.433,00:08:38.852,I lost something.
00:08:39.936,00:08:41.229,SHAUN: No.
00:08:41.271,00:08:43.606,But I know where it is now.
00:08:55.576,00:08:57.204,Shaun.
00:09:00.874,00:09:04.044,You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
00:09:04.085,00:09:06.587,A DTI?
00:09:15.096,00:09:17.015,You should get more imaging.
00:09:20.894,00:09:22.562,"That's not gonna happen, Shaun."
00:09:25.690,00:09:27.567,My scalpel isn't here.
00:09:38.786,00:09:40.330,What happened this time?
00:09:40.372,00:09:41.998,He's got a bleed somewhere.
00:09:42.040,00:09:45.001,I want a capsule endoscopy to check the entire length of the bowel for bleeding and leaks.
00:09:45.043,00:09:47.295,And get me a complete coagulation and metabolic profile.
00:09:47.337,00:09:48.505,On it.
00:10:02.143,00:10:04.229,What do you mean?
00:10:04.271,00:10:07.648,They say he has a glioma.
00:10:08.733,00:10:10.777,That's a brain tumor.
00:10:14.655,00:10:16.074,Did he get a second opinion?
00:10:24.249,00:10:25.917,Doctors make mistakes.
00:10:27.502,00:10:31.756,I... I want you to sit down.
00:10:31.798,00:10:37.095,That's what people say when they want to tell you something important.
00:10:51.692,00:10:53.528,He won't listen to me.
00:10:53.570,00:10:55.196,He is stubborn.
00:10:55.238,00:10:56.406,That he is.
00:10:56.448,00:10:58.992,He will listen to you.
00:10:59.033,00:11:05.290,"Okay, you have known him longer, you're his friend, he trusts you."
00:11:05.332,00:11:06.958,"Shaun, I can't make him do anything, either."
00:11:07.000,00:11:09.419,You... You...
00:11:18.345,00:11:19.678,You want me to manipulate him?
00:11:21.348,00:11:27.437,You want me to use our relationship and our history to trick him into doing this?
00:11:37.738,00:11:39.866,I knew you wouldn't let him die.
00:11:42.785,00:11:46.080,Our patient has Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation.
00:11:46.122,00:11:48.375,Can anyone tell me why that is very bad?
00:11:48.416,00:11:54.172,"Blood clots form throughout the blood vessels and rapidly deplete the body's clotting factors, thereby causing a systematic bleed."
00:11:54.214,00:11:55.465,It's also a catch-22.
00:11:55.507,00:11:58.885,"If we treat the clotting, he might end up with a terminal bleed."
00:11:58.926,00:12:00.679,"And if we treat the bleeding, he'll have a terminal clot."
00:12:00.719,00:12:02.347,DR. MELENDEZ: So how do we treat it?
00:12:02.389,00:12:03.682,We figure out the cause.
00:12:03.722,00:12:05.559,More damage from the detergent?
00:12:05.600,00:12:06.767,Margins were clear.
00:12:06.809,00:12:08.645,He could have a crush injury from his ankle.
00:12:08.687,00:12:11.189,Or a bacterial infection he picked up before or during surgery.
00:12:11.231,00:12:12.440,It might have been set off by drug use.
00:12:17.404,00:12:19.906,"And by we, I mean Shaun."
00:12:19.947,00:12:22.325,He spaced out in the O.R.
00:12:23.618,00:12:25.828,I'm listening.
00:12:27.205,00:12:28.747,"He could've nicked a vessel, which could've caused..."
00:12:28.789,00:12:29.916,"Okay, we're talking about Shaun."
00:12:33.878,00:12:35.255,He's always focused.
00:12:35.296,00:12:37.382,His stitches look like they came out of a sewing machine.
00:12:39.092,00:12:40.927,All right.
00:12:40.968,00:12:43.096,The kid was in pretty bad shape when we got him.
00:12:46.307,00:12:47.808,Crush trauma being top.
00:12:47.850,00:12:50.228,Get him started on fresh frozen plasma and crystalloid fluids.
00:12:59.362,00:13:01.406,You got a second?
00:13:01.448,00:13:03.366,"Well, that's an open question."
00:13:03.408,00:13:04.783,What can I do for you?
00:13:06.327,00:13:08.829,I got a patient with DIC.
00:13:08.871,00:13:11.416,One of the possible causes is surgeon error.
00:13:11.458,00:13:12.709,"Your patient, your error?"
00:13:12.751,00:13:14.877,Shaun's.
00:13:14.919,00:13:18.131,"He got distracted during surgery, spaced out."
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.842,One place he never misses a beat is the O.R.
00:13:23.428,00:13:25.764,Is there anything going on that I should know about?
00:13:31.060,00:13:32.395,About what?
00:13:32.437,00:13:35.148,It's a personal matter.
00:13:35.189,00:13:38.817,Shaun was distracted by a personal issue?
00:13:40.612,00:13:41.904,"What, did Lea come back?"
00:13:45.992,00:13:47.368,His cable get cut off?
00:13:48.787,00:13:50.913,I have an inoperable glioma.
00:13:52.831,00:13:54.334,Eighteen months.
00:14:00.423,00:14:02.008,"Aaron, I am so sorry."
00:14:03.176,00:14:04.427,"Me, too."
00:14:06.429,00:14:08.097,Is there anything I can do?
00:14:09.599,00:14:10.849,I wish.
00:14:13.936,00:14:15.396,You should've told me.
00:14:18.857,00:14:20.318,Or at least you shouldn't have told him.
00:14:39.170,00:14:41.589,His coagulation factors are still off.
00:14:41.631,00:14:42.674,Crush trauma isn't the issue.
00:14:42.716,00:14:44.425,And his tox screen came back clean.
00:14:46.511,00:14:50.390,"He's had so many transfusions, the blood in his veins isn't the same blood he came in with."
00:14:55.144,00:14:57.104,"The kid came directly from a frat hazing, hammered."
00:14:57.146,00:14:59.232,What are the odds he wasn't on drugs?
00:14:59.273,00:15:02.151,We should start IV midazolam and sodium bicarbonate to counteract...
00:15:02.193,00:15:04.111,That's the treatment for amphetamines.
00:15:04.153,00:15:06.072,"If you're wrong, that could cause a fatal arrhythmia."
00:15:13.079,00:15:14.622,You're going to find out by asking?
00:15:14.664,00:15:16.416,Blake was honest with me before.
00:15:16.457,00:15:18.543,It's a lot easier to be honest when you're not confessing to a crime.
00:15:18.585,00:15:20.294,We don't have a lot of choice in the matter.
00:15:22.046,00:15:23.923,That's not true.
00:15:26.551,00:15:27.968,Thanks for doing this.
00:15:31.514,00:15:33.349,Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.
00:15:33.391,00:15:34.934,Figured it should get cleaned up.
00:15:37.771,00:15:39.522,Is it all right if I draw some blood?
00:15:39.564,00:15:41.775,Just want to make sure you don't have any toxins or infections.
00:15:41.816,00:15:43.234,Sure.
00:15:51.743,00:15:53.244,Do you know what that is?
00:15:53.286,00:15:54.495,Mmm-mmm.
00:15:54.537,00:15:58.708,"Well, in short, his body is clotting and hemorrhaging at the same time."
00:16:06.758,00:16:08.259,Just hold that there for me.
00:16:09.385,00:16:10.970,All done.
00:16:13.598,00:16:14.974,"DR. PARK: Blake, buddy, you're on something."
00:16:15.015,00:16:18.352,"Your pupils are dilated, and you're sweating in a 68-degree room."
00:16:24.609,00:16:25.944,Molly.
00:16:29.739,00:16:31.365,I would've told you the truth if you'd asked.
00:16:32.659,00:16:33.993,I'm sorry.
00:16:36.621,00:16:38.414,You have time to talk?
00:16:41.167,00:16:43.962,Shaun told you.
00:16:44.003,00:16:45.630,I wish I would've heard it from you.
00:16:45.672,00:16:47.632,"Yeah, I'm sorry."
00:16:47.674,00:16:49.592,We're friends.
00:16:51.427,00:16:53.763,Yes.
00:16:55.306,00:16:57.517,To do what?
00:16:59.268,00:17:01.771,"Okay, well, what I need is to be left alone, okay?"
00:17:01.813,00:17:04.691,"Well, you told Shaun, so that was a brilliant strategy."
00:17:04.732,00:17:06.066,"Okay, okay, I get it."
00:17:06.108,00:17:08.569,"Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?"
00:17:08.611,00:17:11.280,"Sometimes when people are told they are dying, they do stupid things!"
00:17:11.322,00:17:14.575,Sometimes people around them do stupid things!
00:17:14.617,00:17:19.288,"Shaun told you to come here to try to convince me to get more imaging, right?"
00:17:26.170,00:17:27.588,Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop...
00:17:31.175,00:17:32.259,Don't you dare.
00:17:35.137,00:17:37.849,"What are you gonna say, huh?"
00:17:41.728,00:17:43.437,Huh?
00:17:57.577,00:17:59.119,Thank you.
00:18:02.874,00:18:05.501,And you should get the DTI.
00:18:07.837,00:18:09.964,Not for you.
00:18:10.006,00:18:13.051,You've accepted your diagnosis.
00:18:14.427,00:18:15.386,Shaun hasn't.
00:18:18.723,00:18:20.934,He needs to.
00:18:25.730,00:18:27.231,"DR. ANDREWS: Hey, Neil."
00:18:27.273,00:18:29.567,I heard there was a complication in one of your cases.
00:18:29.609,00:18:31.444,Caden Hauley?
00:18:31.485,00:18:33.988,DR. MELENDEZ: Heard or have you been monitoring all of Murphy's cases?
00:18:36.282,00:18:37.784,Eighteen-year-old with DIC.
00:18:37.825,00:18:39.493,Any idea what set it off?
00:18:41.746,00:18:44.082,The kid was in pretty bad shape when he got to us.
00:18:44.123,00:18:47.877,I'm also wondering why you were in two surgeries at once.
00:18:47.919,00:18:49.545,You left three first-years unattended?
00:18:51.631,00:18:53.424,You know we do this all the time.
00:18:57.720,00:18:59.973,I hope Caden pulls through.
00:19:07.021,00:19:10.399,You got a very quick appointment.
00:19:10.441,00:19:12.401,"I have connections, Shaun."
00:19:14.070,00:19:17.156,Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?
00:19:17.197,00:19:19.784,"Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too."
00:19:19.826,00:19:21.995,"Yes, but what did she tell you?"
00:19:23.162,00:19:24.580,I don't think this is a good time.
00:19:24.622,00:19:26.040,When is a good time?
00:19:28.084,00:19:32.171,"I have a lot to learn from you, and if you're dying, less than two years to learn."
00:19:36.216,00:19:38.344,Sorry to keep you waiting.
00:19:38.385,00:19:41.221,There were some surprises on your images.
00:19:41.263,00:19:43.390,The previous diagnosis was incorrect.
00:19:43.432,00:19:47.186,You have a glioblastoma multiforme located in your pons.
00:19:48.312,00:19:53.317,"I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but it's the most aggressive form of brain cancer."
00:19:54.610,00:19:59.198,"We estimate three, maybe four months."
00:20:01.117,00:20:07.790,I can have my assistant get in touch with you to refer you to a therapist when you're ready.
00:20:17.133,00:20:21.303,"He still has low blood pressure and thin blood, which means the treatment for the MDMA didn't work."
00:20:21.345,00:20:22.889,So the Molly wasn't the problem?
00:20:22.930,00:20:25.391,"It certainly didn't help him, but now we think he..."
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.434,Our best guess is Caden has a bacterial infection.
00:20:34.734,00:20:36.736,DIC?
00:20:36.777,00:20:38.779,What happened there?
00:20:38.821,00:20:40.614,"Uh, we're not sure yet."
00:20:40.656,00:20:42.408,He was pretty sick when he came in.
00:20:42.449,00:20:44.994,I guess sometimes complications just happen.
00:20:45.036,00:20:46.328,Interesting choice of words.
00:20:49.289,00:20:51.291,"Yeah, he said it during a differential."
00:20:51.333,00:20:53.460,I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.
00:20:53.502,00:20:55.504,It's not like Melendez to be that laissez-faire.
00:20:55.546,00:20:57.548,He usually likes to know exactly why things happen.
00:20:57.590,00:20:59.592,One of the traits I admire about him.
00:20:59.633,00:21:01.552,"Yeah, well, we're trying to figure it out."
00:21:01.594,00:21:03.846,"But so far, the cultures are negative."
00:21:03.888,00:21:05.347,Shaun's closing was textbook.
00:21:05.389,00:21:07.307,Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.
00:21:09.351,00:21:11.437,I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.
00:21:11.478,00:21:12.396,Good for him.
00:21:35.669,00:21:37.171,Shaun.
00:21:37.213,00:21:40.758,"Yes, yes, there are many different explanations."
00:21:46.139,00:21:47.848,"Shaun, you have to accept..."
00:21:47.890,00:21:49.391,"No, I don't accept."
00:21:49.433,00:21:51.644,I don't accept.
00:21:51.685,00:21:53.771,"No, you were not right."
00:21:53.813,00:21:55.982,I said doctors make mistakes...
00:21:58.234,00:21:59.860,Shaun was right.
00:21:59.902,00:22:01.612,Imaging is unreliable.
00:22:01.654,00:22:03.322,The imaging that you asked me to get.
00:22:03.363,00:22:06.200,Imaging is subject to interpretation.
00:22:07.367,00:22:15.835,"Yes, studies have shown that experts rely on... On... On subjective measures based on experience rather than object..."
00:22:15.876,00:22:17.170,Rather than objective...
00:22:17.211,00:22:18.462,"No. No, no."
00:22:18.504,00:22:20.923,No more.
00:22:25.761,00:22:27.805,Some are curable.
00:22:27.847,00:22:29.807,Some are curable.
00:22:29.849,00:22:32.268,"Stop, please, will ya?"
00:22:32.310,00:22:33.978,Stop!
00:22:39.233,00:22:41.568,I am not hurting you.
00:22:41.610,00:22:42.987,"Oh, my God, stop."
00:22:45.363,00:22:46.740,"No, you're not."
00:22:47.992,00:22:50.953,I don't need theories.
00:22:57.335,00:23:00.296,I don't want to think about dying!
00:23:03.216,00:23:04.842,I want to go on a long drive somewhere.
00:23:06.802,00:23:08.346,I want to watch football.
00:23:08.386,00:23:10.597,It's not football season.
00:23:10.639,00:23:13.059,I know it's not football season.
00:23:15.602,00:23:18.396,Do you mean you want to have fun?
00:23:23.652,00:23:24.987,Yeah.
00:23:30.201,00:23:32.410,So you can keep fighting.
00:23:33.162,00:23:34.747,Keep fighting if you want.
00:23:36.249,00:23:39.043,It's futile and it's stupid.
00:23:42.462,00:23:44.422,Or you can come with me.
00:24:09.365,00:24:11.242,How long has he been hypoxic?
00:24:11.284,00:24:12.993,It came on suddenly five minutes ago.
00:24:13.035,00:24:15.037,"He's on 100% high-flow oxygen, and his numbers aren't budging."
00:24:15.079,00:24:16.747,He's ventilating fine.
00:24:16.789,00:24:19.208,He must have thrombosed his pulmonary artery.
00:24:19.250,00:24:21.419,We need to dissolve this clot before his heart stops.
00:24:21.459,00:24:22.962,"Jared, prep for jugular access."
00:24:23.003,00:24:24.380,50 milligrams T.P.A. infusion now.
00:24:35.308,00:24:42.606,"The Saturday after Valentine's Day, her favorite day of the year, even more than her birthday."
00:24:42.648,00:25:05.503,"The Chamber of Commerce would decorate this place and put out a crappy buffet meal, hire a DJ, and I'd put on a tux, and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress, and she'd pin my bow tie on me, and I'd pin a little yellow corsage on her."
00:25:06.880,00:25:12.011,And we'd come and we'd eat and we'd... And we'd dance.
00:25:15.181,00:25:26.108,"your smiling face I love you, sweetie."
00:25:27.026,00:25:28.526,I love you more.
00:25:28.568,00:25:30.863,"Oh, you think so, huh?"
00:25:32.490,00:25:42.416,"You can take how much you love me, which I know is quite a lot, and then you can double it, and then you can add 10, and that's how much I love you."
00:25:42.458,00:25:47.004,if it grows stronger every day I love you more.
00:25:52.009,00:26:10.568,"a couple of times before And I remember thinking, This is the moment that I know will be in my mind when I... When I..."
00:26:29.629,00:26:32.258,I lost my toy scalpel.
00:26:35.428,00:26:37.595,The one that Steve gave me.
00:26:40.640,00:26:42.600,"Yeah, I figured that was the one."
00:26:42.642,00:26:44.937,I have been looking for a whole day.
00:26:46.146,00:26:48.399,I think it may be gone forever.
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.949,Maybe I'll come here when you're dead.
00:26:59.285,00:27:00.618,Okay.
00:27:04.998,00:27:07.793,Are your memories of your daughter enough for you?
00:27:10.546,00:27:11.964,Not even close.
00:27:23.016,00:27:24.768,"No, Shaun, you should go."
00:27:24.810,00:27:25.978,Okay.
00:27:36.530,00:27:38.407,Not all the cultures are back.
00:27:38.449,00:27:41.243,"But since he's not responding to any antibiotics, we can rule out bacterial."
00:27:41.285,00:27:43.078,DR. REZNICK: It was never a great fit.
00:27:43.120,00:27:44.788,It's a better fit than surgical error.
00:27:44.830,00:27:47.874,What if it is bacterial but resistant to all...
00:27:47.916,00:27:50.794,What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria?
00:27:50.836,00:27:53.631,PNH? The incidence is literally one in a million.
00:27:53.671,00:27:55.299,What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?
00:27:56.550,00:27:57.717,"No, it's not PNH."
00:27:57.759,00:27:59.470,Caden had normal flow cytometry.
00:27:59.512,00:28:03.056,Exotic snake venom can trigger consumptive coagulopathies.
00:28:03.098,00:28:05.725,"So can pre-eclampsia, but he's not pregnant and he wasn't charming snakes."
00:28:09.146,00:28:11.482,"Murphy, any thoughts here?"
00:28:12.608,00:28:14.652,It is kind of your ass on the line.
00:28:33.795,00:28:37.132,I know why Caden has DIC.
00:28:39.677,00:28:43.556,I squeezed the artery between two clamps.
00:28:43.597,00:28:47.601,"I must have ruptured the aortic wall, causing a pseudo-aneurysm."
00:28:47.643,00:28:49.144,It was my mistake.
00:28:51.313,00:28:53.148,And also...
00:28:55.317,00:28:57.736,I have to make a bowel movement.
00:29:06.537,00:29:09.373,He's gonna puke.
00:29:09.415,00:29:10.957,He's going to Glassman.
00:29:14.461,00:29:17.881,I told Dr. Melendez I had to make a bowel movement.
00:29:17.923,00:29:21.176,I think he believed me.
00:29:21.218,00:29:23.721,Color me proud.
00:29:32.229,00:29:34.273,We already...
00:29:34.314,00:29:37.025,"We already have my answer, Shaun."
00:29:37.067,00:29:46.577,"We can't do a biopsy on you because of the arteries in the way, like the arteries in Caden's abdomen, but we can't move the arteries in your brain because..."
00:29:49.371,00:29:51.457,Because you were sad.
00:29:51.498,00:29:52.832,What didn't I want to do?
00:29:54.668,00:29:56.754,Do you not know the answers to these questions?
00:29:56.795,00:29:58.297,"I do know the answers, Shaun."
00:29:58.338,00:30:00.299,I don't think you know the answers to these questions.
00:30:00.340,00:30:02.301,You're not hearing me.
00:30:02.342,00:30:03.802,There's still hope.
00:30:05.429,00:30:06.888,"Shaun, look at me."
00:30:07.806,00:30:09.433,"Look at me, please."
00:30:12.686,00:30:15.105,There is no hope for me.
00:30:16.607,00:30:17.857,"I mean, hope?"
00:30:17.899,00:30:19.401,What... What...
00:30:19.443,00:30:21.612,You hope the 49ers find a defense.
00:30:24.281,00:30:26.408,Doesn't mean they magically learn how to tackle.
00:30:26.450,00:30:29.077,Doesn't mean the bus driver suddenly drives faster.
00:30:31.371,00:30:34.040,Hope is irrelevant for me.
00:30:34.916,00:30:37.043,Hope is painful.
00:30:38.962,00:30:44.092,I don't want to spend what's left of my life chasing my tail around in a circle.
00:30:54.144,00:30:55.854,Okay.
00:31:13.997,00:31:17.083,Your tumor is located at the base of your skull.
00:31:19.044,00:31:23.841,An open cranial biopsy would tell us what's wrong.
00:31:23.882,00:31:25.967,But there are blood vessels in the way.
00:31:26.009,00:31:28.928,The biopsy would cause an aneurysm or a bleed.
00:31:30.639,00:31:39.939,"But if we go through your nasal cribriform plate, we can cross the tentorium on the contralateral side and avoid all those blood vessels."
00:31:42.735,00:31:45.696,We can do a biopsy through your nose.
00:31:53.829,00:31:55.955,"You can't die, too."
00:32:03.589,00:32:05.090,I have to throw up.
00:32:12.389,00:32:14.558,DR. REZNICK: So how do we do this?
00:32:14.600,00:32:15.726,Talk to Andrews personally?
00:32:15.768,00:32:17.185,You want to report Shaun?
00:32:17.227,00:32:19.979,I don't want to.
00:32:21.732,00:32:26.945,And we'd certainly have to if our sole agenda would be to take down Shaun and to give you one less person to compete against.
00:32:26.986,00:32:34.202,"And certainly, we'd absolutely have to cover up and bury a possible fatal medical error if our sole agenda was to protect a friend?"
00:32:34.244,00:32:37.080,Protocol would seem to favor the bitch over the friend.
00:32:37.122,00:32:38.331,Thanks?
00:32:44.797,00:32:47.758,We have a duty to report errors so they won't happen again.
00:32:48.717,00:32:50.427,The process saves lives.
00:32:50.469,00:32:53.012,And exactly what errors are we trying to avoid a repeat of?
00:32:53.054,00:32:58.017,You worried about the next time an autistic surgeon operates on a drugged-up frat kid after finding out his mentor is dying of brain cancer?
00:33:01.772,00:33:03.523,"Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun."
00:33:03.565,00:33:04.733,We're really sorry.
00:33:06.067,00:33:07.611,It's okay.
00:33:07.653,00:33:09.529,It's okay.
00:33:09.571,00:33:12.741,I think he's going to be okay.
00:33:12.783,00:33:15.786,DR. PARK: The protocol exists so that we don't ask questions like that.
00:33:15.828,00:33:17.329,That seems like a bad idea.
00:33:17.370,00:33:19.164,You trust your judgment.
00:33:19.205,00:33:20.916,Do you trust Morgan's judgment?
00:33:20.958,00:33:22.876,Do you trust the judgment of all the doctors in this building?
00:33:22.918,00:33:24.962,"If you can make judgment calls, so can they."
00:33:25.003,00:33:26.922,That's why we need these rules.
00:33:26.964,00:33:30.843,"No, the protocol is fine for everyone in this building, except for Shaun."
00:33:30.884,00:33:33.637,"They'd reprimand any one of us, but they will fire him."
00:33:34.554,00:33:35.806,Okay.
00:33:36.932,00:33:38.224,We report it.
00:33:38.266,00:33:41.269,"We get the investigation, make sure nothing like this ever happens again."
00:33:42.729,00:33:44.022,But we tell them I did it.
00:33:45.398,00:33:47.651,"They'd fire you, too."
00:33:49.027,00:33:50.570,DR. REZNICK: It's not a terrible idea.
00:33:50.612,00:33:51.947,Jared's out the door either way.
00:33:51.989,00:33:53.949,Can we get back to the medicine?
00:33:53.991,00:33:56.409,Caden is still alive.
00:33:53.991,00:33:58.161,"If we can keep it that way, there won't be an M&amp;M review."
00:33:58.203,00:34:01.164,"Which means no one will be asking questions, and no one will have to give answers."
00:34:02.290,00:34:06.712,"If Caden dies, we tell the truth and we face the consequences together."
00:34:07.880,00:34:09.047,SHAUN: No.
00:34:12.968,00:34:16.054,I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.
00:34:19.349,00:34:21.226,"We need you to come back to the group, Murphy."
00:34:39.202,00:34:40.913,Hey.
00:34:40.954,00:34:43.498,Do you still feel the same way about Dr. Murphy as when he got here?
00:34:46.043,00:34:50.088,Dr. Glassman gave us certain assurances.
00:34:53.132,00:35:02.768,"If Shaun proves anything less than excellent, if Shaun doesn't live up to everything I know he can do, he will be immediately released, and I will resign my position as president of the hospital."
00:35:02.809,00:35:04.269,And you wrote it down.
00:35:04.310,00:35:06.479,I made sure it was in the minutes.
00:35:06.521,00:35:08.690,Shaun has exceeded my expectations.
00:35:08.732,00:35:11.860,"Mine, as well, and?"
00:35:11.902,00:35:14.487,And my feelings about Dr. Glassman have not changed.
00:35:23.246,00:35:24.790,DR. MELENDEZ: We need to cut him open.
00:35:24.831,00:35:26.458,DR. PARK: We cut him open and he dies.
00:35:26.499,00:35:29.461,He'll bleed out before we can even get the artery exposed.
00:35:34.674,00:35:36.301,Don't cut him open.
00:35:36.342,00:35:37.719,"Murphy, if we don't..."
00:35:37.761,00:35:43.058,We should insert an endovascular graft through his leg instead.
00:35:43.100,00:35:45.310,Fix it from the inside out.
00:35:45.351,00:35:50.107,"I've done that for large abdominal aorta dilations, but this is a lengthy dissecting pseudo-aneurysm."
00:35:50.189,00:35:51.232,It's safer.
00:35:52.901,00:35:54.486,Could rupture completely.
00:35:54.527,00:35:58.657,Caden could die as soon as we deflate the balloon inside the graft.
00:35:58.698,00:36:00.283,Not definitely.
00:36:00.325,00:36:03.954,There's still a chance Caden will simply come out of this without any surgical intervention.
00:36:03.996,00:36:05.204,"5%, 10% maybe."
00:36:05.246,00:36:06.790,DR. PARK: Not nothing.
00:36:06.832,00:36:09.584,And we're doubling down on Shaun after we know he caused this problem.
00:36:09.626,00:36:11.294,How's that gonna look at an M&amp;M?
00:36:12.754,00:36:15.340,I trust Shaun's idea.
00:36:15.381,00:36:20.762,"He makes mistakes no one else would make, but he also makes saves none of us would have ever thought of."
00:36:21.429,00:36:22.806,Thank you.
00:36:22.848,00:36:24.390,You're welcome.
00:36:24.432,00:36:26.225,I still don't think you should be working here.
00:36:26.267,00:36:27.435,I don't think the trade-off is worth it.
00:36:29.437,00:36:31.189,"Well, let's prep him for surgery."
00:36:37.320,00:36:38.822,"DR. MELENDEZ: Pull the guide wire, Reznick."
00:36:44.202,00:36:45.704,I'm passing in the graft.
00:36:48.498,00:36:50.834,CLAIRE: You're right over the pseudo-aneurysm now.
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.223,DR. MELENDEZ: Inflating the balloon to deploy the graft.
00:37:14.607,00:37:15.775,Deflating.
00:37:19.154,00:37:20.739,DR. MELENDEZ: It's delicate.
00:37:20.780,00:37:21.907,"SHAUN: No, it's not."
00:37:24.283,00:37:27.204,And it will either work or it won't work.
00:37:29.164,00:37:34.460,"If my idea is wrong, he'll die as soon as we complete this next step."
00:37:36.462,00:37:38.631,You shouldn't have to live with that.
00:37:44.179,00:37:46.973,DR. MELENDEZ: Everything that happens in this room is my responsibility.
00:37:50.769,00:37:52.145,We'll do it together.
00:38:32.060,00:38:33.311,Nobody's going home.
00:38:35.313,00:38:38.775,I am proud of this team and what we accomplished today.
00:38:40.277,00:38:42.154,Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.
00:38:43.613,00:38:45.364,We're celebrating?
00:38:45.406,00:38:47.366,"Today was a disaster, and we got lucky."
00:38:49.035,00:38:50.829,You're right.
00:38:50.870,00:38:53.331,"But when you get lucky, you celebrate."
00:39:10.140,00:39:13.351,"At some point in your career, you're going to kill someone."
00:39:15.353,00:39:19.191,And I hope for your sake there's a doctor out there who still believes in you when you do.
00:39:34.289,00:39:37.542,It was there all along.
00:39:37.583,00:39:40.628,"I have to go drinking, but I wanted you to know..."
00:39:40.670,00:39:41.838,Uh...
00:39:43.048,00:39:44.632,Is that from an IV?
00:39:47.385,00:39:48.845,You did the biopsy.
00:39:50.055,00:39:51.389,I did.
00:39:53.099,00:39:55.101,I have a low-grade glioma.
00:39:57.645,00:39:59.397,I told you...
00:39:59.438,00:40:02.025,"Cancer, Shaun."
00:40:02.067,00:40:06.654,"I have to undergo brain surgery, which is really scary because I'm not the one performing it."
00:40:06.696,00:40:11.409,"Five days a week for six weeks of radiation, ten more weeks of chemotherapy."
00:40:37.352,00:40:38.561,You're going to live.
00:40:46.569,00:40:48.238,Now go.
00:40:48.696,00:40:50.407,Yes.
00:40:50.448,00:40:52.992,First I have to tell Dr. Andrews about the mistake I made.
00:40:53.034,00:40:54.994,"Shaun, you..."
00:40:55.036,00:40:58.831,"Protocol is clear, and reporting saves lives."
00:40:58.873,00:41:03.253,"And I hear Caden is on the road to recovery, so your mistake couldn't have been too bad."
00:41:03.295,00:41:05.088,"No, I made a mistake."
00:41:05.130,00:41:06.464,"Shaun, I understand that."
00:41:08.716,00:41:12.429,And do you remember the commitment that Dr. Glassman made when you were hired?
00:41:12.470,00:41:14.722,"I promised you'd be excellent, right, Shaun?"
00:41:14.764,00:41:16.474,And you have been excellent.
00:41:17.558,00:41:20.603,You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.
00:41:22.021,00:41:24.690,I was not excellent.
00:41:24.732,00:41:26.484,"This time, I was bad."
00:41:28.820,00:41:32.573,And surgeons have to be excellent every time.
00:41:32.615,00:41:33.950,"Right, Shaun?"
00:41:35.076,00:41:36.286,You agree with him?
00:41:36.328,00:41:39.080,I'm not gonna ask him to lie to save my job.
00:41:41.040,00:41:42.500,Don't do this.
00:41:45.378,00:41:47.339,It's up to Shaun.
00:41:47.380,00:41:48.923,I trust your judgment.
00:41:55.347,00:41:57.349,I'm not doing this to hurt you.
00:41:57.890,00:41:59.767,I know.
00:41:59.809,00:42:01.686,We are friends.
00:42:01.727,00:42:03.062,"Yes, we are."
00:42:03.938,00:42:05.731,I love you.
00:42:05.773,00:42:07.525,I know.
00:42:11.070,00:42:12.530,I love you more.
