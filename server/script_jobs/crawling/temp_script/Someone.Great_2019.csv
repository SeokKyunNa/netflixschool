00:00:36.703,00:00:38.455,Yes! Time for drinks!
00:00:38.538,00:00:39.414,"-Yes, it is. -Yay!"
00:00:43.209,00:00:44.085,Be careful.
00:00:56.556,00:00:59.976,"Beautiful man down my back, I have to deliver him to..."
00:01:01.144,00:01:04.064,"-No one can smoke in here! -What up, bitches? Hey!"
00:01:04.147,00:01:05.815,"-What up, girl? -What up?"

00:01:18.536,00:01:21.456,Because he literally looks like somebody put glasses on a slice of Wonder Bread.
00:01:21.539,00:01:23.374,You talking about that dude from Postal Service?
00:01:27.045,00:01:30.465,"All right, toast to another successful Neon Classic."
00:01:35.595,00:01:37.222,-For your cray-ass kids. -What?
00:01:40.725,00:01:41.684,That's not a myth.
00:01:42.227,00:01:43.061,-Look. -Oh!
00:01:48.399,00:01:49.234,Idiots.
00:01:49.776,00:01:52.070,"I don't know if you know this, man, but love is a lie."
00:01:55.365,00:01:58.034,I'm sorry. It's just tonight was terrible.
00:01:58.118,00:01:59.911,"Me and my man broke up, of nine years."
00:01:59.994,00:02:01.246,-No big deal. -Mm-hmm.
00:02:01.329,00:02:03.957,"I'm moving to San Francisco, 'cause I got my dream job."
00:02:04.040,00:02:08.336,"Career girl over here, -doing the damn thing. Getting it done. -Okay."
00:02:08.419,00:02:09.546,-You know? -Yeah. Time's up.
00:02:09.629,00:02:11.506,And he just didn't want to do long distance.
00:02:11.589,00:02:12.966,-Wow! -I know.
00:02:13.341,00:02:14.217,-Really? -Mm-hmm.
00:02:14.300,00:02:15.468,With FaceTime?
00:02:15.885,00:02:17.512,-With everything. -And all the high-speed Internet?
00:02:17.595,00:02:19.889,"-That's what I said. -I mean, that's fucked up."
00:02:19.973,00:02:22.559,"-Thank you, that's what I said! -Why he leave you like that?"
00:02:25.061,00:02:26.896,"Look at you, with your pretty teeth and shit."
00:02:26.980,00:02:27.814,Thank you!
00:02:27.897,00:02:29.649,"-I told him I had pretty teeth! -Oh, my God!"
00:02:29.732,00:02:34.195,What man don't wanna put his dick in your mouth with those pretty teeth chompin' on that dick?
00:02:37.073,00:02:39.534,I gotta stop going to Craigslist to find dick.
00:02:39.784,00:02:41.327,-You do! -I do!
00:02:41.536,00:02:43.329,-You're beautiful. -Am I?
00:02:43.413,00:02:44.289,"Come on, girl."
00:02:44.372,00:02:46.791,I feel like we're before-and-after pictures right now.
00:02:49.919,00:02:52.380,"I'm kinda over this conversation, to be honest."
00:02:57.510,00:02:59.345,What the fuck just happened?
00:04:18.675,00:04:21.678,You just always fucking walk away! Really? Real grown-up!
00:05:02.260,00:05:03.261,What the fuck?
00:05:34.167,00:05:36.336,"Mm, fuck, I can't do this."
00:05:37.211,00:05:38.046,Why?
00:05:38.129,00:05:39.756,"Oh, that was super misleading, right?"
00:05:39.839,00:05:43.009,"Like, I want to do this, it's just, I have mad appointments today."
00:05:44.677,00:05:48.222,in Cobble Hill for three million dollars.
00:05:48.598,00:05:50.516,God bless the middle-aged whites.
00:05:50.600,00:05:52.727,"Keeping a bitch paid. It's like reparations, you know?"
00:05:55.229,00:05:57.065,I would love for you to meet some of my friends.
00:05:57.815,00:05:58.983,How would you feel about that?
00:06:04.113,00:06:08.951,"Mm. Kissing you is nice, but it doesn't absolve you from answering me."
00:06:16.125,00:06:19.087,-Fuck it. We can talk later. -Mm-hmm.
00:06:30.306,00:06:36.729,"Dude... I just went to pet a Chihuahua outside our building, and it was a fucking rat."
00:06:36.813,00:06:38.523,"Oh, my God, I need coffee."
00:06:38.606,00:06:40.483,"Coffee, coffee, please."
00:06:40.566,00:06:42.443,"Please, love me right!"
00:06:43.945,00:06:47.281,"Popped by Casablanca to meet up with Sasha and Rory, right?"
00:06:47.365,00:06:49.534,"You know, before I went to Leah's or whatever."
00:06:49.617,00:06:52.703,And Sasha's dating this 22-year-old femme goddess.
00:06:52.787,00:06:55.206,"Seriously, you gotta check her Instagram. Oh, my favorite mug."
00:06:55.289,00:06:56.874,You love me so much.
00:06:57.500,00:07:00.253,I think it's very cute that you have a girlfriend.
00:07:00.336,00:07:02.880,"You guys have been together for like four months now, right?"
00:07:04.382,00:07:05.842,I don't have a girlfriend.
00:07:05.925,00:07:06.843,Leah...
00:07:07.385,00:07:10.596,"is a girl... who is my friend, who I see..."
00:07:11.389,00:07:16.018,"on consecutive nights, and whose company I enjoy more than anyone else's in the whole entire world."
00:07:17.228,00:07:22.650,Whatever. Kindly leave your heteronormative labels in a motherfucking box to the motherfucking left.
00:07:22.733,00:07:24.652,-Thank you! -You love her.
00:07:24.735,00:07:25.653,Whatever.
00:07:27.405,00:07:29.824,"Wow, did I sleep late or what?"
00:07:29.949,00:07:31.617,-Mm. -Morning.
00:07:36.831,00:07:37.665,I'm gonna...
00:07:49.177,00:07:51.345,"-Yes? -You're gonna break up with him, or..."
00:07:55.391,00:07:58.769,We don't have to be all over each other to prove that we're in love.
00:07:58.853,00:08:00.897,"Sure, lit, but also you hate him, so..."
00:08:00.980,00:08:02.815,Do you remember when we were talking about cleaning your room?
00:08:02.899,00:08:04.275,Did you not hear me?
00:08:04.358,00:08:06.235,"Or were you just like, I'm not gonna do that anyway."
00:08:06.319,00:08:09.363,"Madame, what can I make you for breakfast?"
00:08:10.907,00:08:11.741,Ooh.
00:08:20.333,00:08:21.417,There's my breakfast.
00:08:27.507,00:08:28.466,I love you.
00:08:34.347,00:08:35.181,Shut up.
00:08:38.017,00:08:39.644,-A little bit. -I love you. Let me just...
00:08:48.986,00:08:49.862,What?
00:08:56.244,00:08:58.120,-Is that Jenny's Instagram? -Mm-hmm.
00:08:59.288,00:09:00.373,"No, you don't think."
00:09:01.123,00:09:06.462,"I mean, I don't know, the last time she was listening to this joint was when Matt broke her heart, senior year."
00:09:06.671,00:09:09.632,Maybe she's just... listening to it. Probably nothing.
00:09:12.802,00:09:15.555,No. There's no way that her and Nate broke up.
00:09:25.273,00:09:26.732,-Hey! -Hi!
00:09:26.816,00:09:28.568,"Cool, cool, cool. You saw my story."
00:09:28.651,00:09:30.486,-How are you? -What happened? Who I gotta kill?
00:09:30.570,00:09:31.404,You okay?
00:09:31.487,00:09:33.531,"We broke up last night, but I'm 100% fine."
00:09:33.614,00:09:36.951,"Like, we-- we-- we were together for, like, nine years, right?"
00:09:37.034,00:09:38.578,"Like, and now we're not."
00:09:38.661,00:09:40.329,"Anyway, Nate sucks."
00:09:48.796,00:09:50.715,"Hold onto your nips, because I have some epic news."
00:09:54.552,00:09:56.178,Neon Classic.
00:09:56.846,00:09:58.681,We haven't been to the festival in three years.
00:09:58.764,00:10:05.688,"It was just announced that Neon Classic is doing a pop-up show at Sony Hall, and it is going to be fucking awesome. Okay?"
00:10:05.771,00:10:07.607,"Secret show, secret headliner."
00:10:07.732,00:10:11.277,"I got us three all-access passes, courtesy of the Rolling Stone."
00:10:11.360,00:10:21.537,"-Yes, you do, bitch! -You know crowds make me uncomfortable Basically, I just want you to call your place of work and tell them you have your period or something and come over to my apartment."
00:10:21.621,00:10:22.997,-Done. -I can't do that. I'm sorry.
00:10:23.080,00:10:30.463,"-Blair! -I'm sorry. I'm running point on a very important tastemakers' brunch next week, and I'm presenting my Instagram strategy to the team today, and I can't miss the hashtag rollout."
00:10:30.671,00:10:33.341,"Everything you said just, like, sucked."
00:10:33.424,00:10:37.219,"Did you mean the rollout of the hashtag, or did you just hashtag the word rollout?"
00:10:37.303,00:10:40.848,Fine. I... will just come over after your meeting for lunch.
00:10:41.057,00:10:43.643,"-Erin, can you get some OJ for mimosas? -Yup."
00:10:43.893,00:10:45.645,"Oh, we also need champagne, though."
00:10:46.729,00:10:50.524,"Because all I got is this, uh, and it may not be here by the time you get here."
00:10:52.777,00:10:55.237,"Okay, I love you both! I love you, bye!"
00:10:55.321,00:10:59.492,"-Bye-ee! -Love you, bye-ee!"
00:10:59.659,00:11:10.795,"You know the beginning of a disaster movie, like, right before the girl who looks like me dies, and, like, right when a girl who look like you walk outside and be like, Oh, my God! Look how crazy the sky looks!?"
00:11:11.587,00:11:12.963,This feels like that.
00:11:48.582,00:11:49.458,Yeah!
00:11:59.260,00:12:00.761,What is this song? Do I know this song?
00:12:03.472,00:12:12.523,"Winter break, -You want me...? -Let it play."
00:12:22.032,00:12:24.034,-What is this song? -I love this song.
00:12:27.163,00:12:29.039,with the study-abroad kids in the bathroom?
00:12:33.419,00:12:36.380,"They hook up, and they move on. But what happened to finding a soulmate?"
00:12:36.922,00:12:39.383,You're only as valuable as your profile picture now.
00:12:42.386,00:12:43.846,You sound like an idiot.
00:12:44.054,00:12:46.140,"Hey, we can't all crush puss like you do."
00:12:47.266,00:12:49.852,You know the reason why you're having a problem with girls?
00:12:49.935,00:12:50.895,Why?
00:12:56.192,00:12:58.235,"You know, people are gonna see that you're doing that."
00:12:58.319,00:13:02.156,"Ah! It's just, when it grows back in, it just all grows towards each other."
00:13:04.700,00:13:07.203,Matt's probably not even gonna be here. What am I even doing here?
00:13:07.286,00:13:13.584,"I BBMed him two days ago, and he still hasn't read it, but he went on BBM today, changed his name, bang, it's like I'm-- so I'm supposed to be, like, a dumbass?"
00:13:13.667,00:13:15.503,"What, are you acting like I don't see that you're active?"
00:13:15.586,00:13:16.462,What the fuck?
00:13:16.545,00:13:17.546,-Right? -He sucks.
00:13:17.630,00:13:19.673,"Well, at least y'all got prospects."
00:13:20.007,00:13:22.676,-What about that girl right down there? -No.
00:13:24.470,00:13:26.138,"No, no, no, undergrad girls are lame."
00:13:26.222,00:13:28.057,"On OkCupid, I put my stuff for 40-up."
00:13:28.808,00:13:30.309,"Older women get me, man."
00:13:30.392,00:13:32.269,It's like they're fucking their son's hot friend.
00:13:33.437,00:13:35.940,"-You stay away from my mother. -Yeah, yeah."
00:13:40.319,00:13:43.322,"Did he just-- Did I just-- -Did I-- Did he just hear me? -Yeah, he did."
00:13:47.910,00:13:48.911,The guy who...

00:14:40.629,00:14:42.298,Let's make him a little jelly.
00:14:43.215,00:14:44.925,"Yes, girl!"
00:15:05.571,00:15:07.364,"-You smell good, boo. -Yeah?"
00:15:07.448,00:15:09.700,"-Damn. -That's great, 'cause I didn't shower today."
00:15:28.761,00:16:03.837,I don't think I've ever heard AIDS said to me -Holy shit. -Ah!
00:16:12.721,00:16:15.307,Oh. Wow!

00:17:11.196,00:17:12.906,"What? No, no, we're going."
00:17:12.990,00:17:14.950,"We're going to the show, okay?"
00:17:15.034,00:17:16.076,I leave in a week.
00:17:16.535,00:17:20.539,"And then I turn 30, and then I die, probably, and I..."
00:17:21.415,00:17:24.126,"can't stop moving, or else I think about, um..."
00:17:28.338,00:17:30.174,I can't leave New York City like this.
00:17:30.257,00:17:31.341,This is the end of an era.
00:17:31.425,00:17:33.594,"You, me, Blair, we've all been caught up in our own shit."
00:17:33.677,00:17:35.179,I need one last epic day with my girls.
00:17:35.262,00:17:36.430,We owe it to the city.
00:17:38.265,00:17:40.768,Trying to make me feel feelings like a motherfucking Pixar movie.
00:17:40.851,00:17:48.108,"-I'm not doing it. -Okay, so I am gonna go get dressed, and you are gonna email everybody that you know -that could get us on that list. -All right."
00:17:51.195,00:17:52.362,I don't... I would email you.
00:17:54.406,00:17:58.952,"We are going to need all hands on deck. We're gonna go down to Blair's office, and we're gonna tell them that her mom died so she can leave."
00:17:59.036,00:18:00.370,Jesus Christ!
00:18:00.454,00:18:01.538,"Okay, fine, her aunt."
00:18:01.622,00:18:07.419,"I'm afraid you don't understand what's fucked up about this suggestion, We need more booze for today."
00:18:07.503,00:18:08.921,"Also, we should get some molly for tonight."
00:18:09.004,00:18:11.048,And then we're gonna go to Neon Classic. We're gonna go mobile!
00:18:12.549,00:18:13.926,And I'm gonna get dressed.
00:18:23.185,00:18:24.812,"Loving this look, BT-dubs."
00:18:25.312,00:18:28.440,It's like Liz Lemon fucked the Salvation Army.
00:18:29.316,00:18:30.526,-Thank you. -Mm-hmm.
00:18:30.776,00:18:32.236,"-Today, I'm free. -Yeah."
00:18:32.319,00:18:36.323,"We need big numbers here, okay? If they don't have an M by their name, I don't want to see them."
00:18:37.491,00:18:38.325,Ugh!
00:18:38.617,00:18:41.286,She's doing that thing where she stands with her shoulders back.
00:18:41.370,00:18:42.496,Good posture is so pretentious.
00:18:42.579,00:18:44.540,"It's like, all right, whatever, we get you."
00:18:44.623,00:18:46.416,"You did ballet till you were, like, in the ninth grade."
00:18:50.087,00:18:50.921,She sees us.
00:18:54.716,00:18:55.551,Yeah.
00:18:57.678,00:18:59.221,And that would be... um...
00:19:01.682,00:19:03.517,"Ah, fuck it."
00:19:06.812,00:19:09.273,"Hey, Blair, can-- can I talk to you for a sec?"
00:19:09.815,00:19:10.732,It's an emergency.
00:19:10.816,00:19:12.234,Your aunt died.
00:19:16.071,00:19:17.281,"Oh, my God."
00:19:17.573,00:19:18.407,Blair.
00:19:19.575,00:19:21.243,Was it Aunt Camille or Aunt Denise?
00:19:21.326,00:19:23.495,"Oh, don't tell me, it's too-- it's too devastating."
00:19:23.579,00:19:24.621,I'm so sorry!
00:19:25.497,00:19:28.834,If you guys could just excuse me for a moment.
00:19:30.669,00:19:33.839,"Go. Um, and I'm gonna pick it up on page, um..."
00:19:34.131,00:19:35.841,five of the presentation.
00:19:35.924,00:19:42.848,"So, let's talk a little bit about visual merchandising on Instagram specifically."
00:19:44.600,00:19:46.852,And why did you just tell my office that my aunt died?
00:19:46.935,00:19:47.769,"Oh, wait..."
00:19:48.270,00:19:49.354,Did Aunt Camille die?
00:19:49.438,00:19:51.690,AC is chillin'.
00:19:52.316,00:19:55.277,"Jenny, on the other hand, is in horrible shape."
00:19:55.611,00:19:56.612,She needs us.
00:19:57.613,00:20:02.117,Our bestie is out there drinking champagne from a bottle of green juice that still has green juice in it.
00:20:05.495,00:20:07.539,"Wait, it's like a green-juice mimosa."
00:20:08.248,00:20:10.250,-That's kinda genius. -She made me try it.
00:20:10.334,00:20:12.794,It's fucking disgusting. I am drowning out here.
00:20:13.128,00:20:14.713,I need you. She needs you.
00:20:15.005,00:20:17.507,"Uh, okay, okay. Of course, yes, I'm gonna come."
00:20:17.591,00:20:20.928,I just... Shit. I need to tell my office that I'm gonna...
00:20:21.970,00:20:22.846,plan a funeral?
00:20:23.180,00:20:25.349,-That's really fucked up. -Love you. Meet you downstairs.
00:20:25.432,00:20:27.935,"-I hate you. Get out of my office. -Mm-hmm. Love you, boo."
00:20:28.602,00:20:29.436,Love you.
00:20:36.360,00:20:39.780,I am so amped for you and this new job. You're about to slay it.
00:20:40.989,00:20:43.909,"It's crazy, y'all. They gave me a staff of people, like..."
00:20:44.284,00:20:46.995,How did I convince them that I should have that much responsibility?
00:20:47.079,00:20:50.040,Fuck that modesty shit! You are the dopest writer we know.
00:20:50.332,00:20:51.416,-A hundred percent. -Aww.
00:20:51.500,00:20:54.419,You have this really unique way of describing music that's...
00:20:54.503,00:20:56.088,-very special. -Mm-hmm.
00:20:56.171,00:20:57.005,You believe that?
00:20:57.089,00:20:57.923,-Yeah. -Girl!
00:21:00.926,00:21:02.261,-Her pants look dope. -Damn.
00:21:02.344,00:21:03.428,I have to take this. I'm so sorry.
00:21:03.512,00:21:04.888,"-Yeah, yeah, go on. -All right. Go on."
00:21:05.722,00:21:06.556,Go for Blair.
00:21:08.225,00:21:11.353,"-Now my boss is... calling me. -Hey, text me when you're done."
00:21:11.436,00:21:12.771,-I'm gonna go for a walk. -Okay.
00:21:16.441,00:21:17.693,You get those numbers I sent you?
00:21:34.918,00:21:36.128,-Done? -Yep.
00:21:36.211,00:21:40.007,"-All right, let's see it. -Okay, I mean, it's super rough, -and it's probably gonna be shit... -Let's see it."
00:21:40.090,00:21:46.096,-But it's-- But it's not gonna be-- -Let's-- -Okay. -All right.
00:21:46.888,00:21:47.723,Okay.
00:21:51.476,00:21:52.311,Wow.
00:21:53.437,00:21:55.314,"This is really fucking good, Jen."
00:21:56.189,00:21:58.400,That dude would be crazy not to hire you.
00:21:58.817,00:21:59.735,Yeah?
00:22:00.193,00:22:01.028,You mean that?
00:22:01.194,00:22:02.487,-Yes. -Thank you.
00:22:02.571,00:22:05.699,"I mean, I do feel confident about it. I definitely think it's in a better spot."
00:22:05.782,00:22:09.411,"And he said that if he liked it, then he would start publishing me ASAP."
00:22:09.494,00:22:12.289,"And it's only 20 bucks a post, but fuck it, right?"
00:22:12.372,00:22:15.751,Because I'll... I'll be able to write about the music that I wanna write about.
00:22:15.834,00:22:18.420,"I'll be able to introduce it to people, and this is the first step."
00:22:18.503,00:22:24.509,"I-- I can freelance now, and then after I graduate, I get on staff, become an editor, and, I don't know, maybe I can run my own thing one day."
00:22:25.344,00:22:26.553,"You're amazing, Jen."
00:22:27.471,00:22:28.513,Fucking amazing.
00:22:28.597,00:22:29.681,It's insane.
00:22:29.765,00:22:35.645,"I mean, you know what you want to do, you're putting your all into it, and you just going forth and doing it. It's, like..."
00:22:38.315,00:22:40.609,Um... I don't know what the fuck I wanna do.
00:22:40.901,00:22:42.903,"-Hey! No, no, uh-uh. -Yeah? What?"
00:22:42.986,00:22:45.822,"No, no, no. Don't do that. Come on, you'll figure it out."
00:22:50.702,00:22:52.371,You wanna be super corny with me real quick?
00:22:56.917,00:22:58.418,"In fact, this is our spot."
00:23:02.214,00:23:03.507,"No, fuck that. You know what?"
00:23:03.590,00:23:05.384,"You want to know how we can do it? I should, uh..."
00:23:09.596,00:23:12.182,"Ooh, I love it when you're dangerous, baby."
00:23:50.512,00:23:51.680,-Good walk? -Yeah.
00:23:52.931,00:23:55.934,"-Oh, Craigslist bro just texted back. -Yeah?"
00:23:56.017,00:23:58.186,Three VIP wristbands!
00:24:00.897,00:24:02.482,-He wrote no dudes? -Mm-hmm.
00:24:02.566,00:24:03.442,Oy!
00:24:03.733,00:24:05.902,"Wait, he's selling them for $500?"
00:24:05.986,00:24:11.241,"Don't worry. I got an advance from Rolling Stone for my moving, and I'm going to share -with the two of you. -Yes."
00:24:11.324,00:24:13.326,I got your tickets. I got your tickets. I got it. I got it.
00:24:13.410,00:24:15.328,I feel like this might be an irresponsible choice.
00:24:15.412,00:24:19.416,"I really want us to think about the choices we're making today, because it seems a little irresponsible."
00:24:19.499,00:24:21.460,Says the woman who spent $400 on mink eyelashes.
00:24:21.543,00:24:23.253,-I'm just saying. -These are real!
00:24:23.336,00:24:28.258,-I don't believe you! -I'm gonna miss this so hard! Ah!
00:24:28.341,00:24:30.427,You did not just find that in your pocket right now.
00:24:30.510,00:24:32.512,"I did, and I have no idea how long it's been there."
00:24:32.679,00:24:33.555,That seems safe.
00:24:33.805,00:24:34.639,It's fine.
00:24:34.764,00:24:35.849,"Blair, calm down."
00:24:36.349,00:24:38.268,"-Weed is like ketchup, it doesn't go bad. -Yep."
00:24:38.351,00:24:39.478,Ketchup goes bad.
00:24:39.644,00:24:42.564,Mm. Then you should definitely not use our ketchup.
00:24:44.107,00:24:47.235,"All right, can we at least move out of the middle of the street if we're gonna smoke weed?"
00:24:49.488,00:24:51.573,Does Bad Blair want to come out and play?
00:24:51.656,00:24:54.284,"No, Bad Blair does not want to come out and play. It is noon."
00:24:57.329,00:24:59.956,This could be one of our last times ever doing this together.
00:25:00.123,00:25:01.917,"-Amen. -I mean, when are we gonna have this..."
00:25:04.586,00:25:05.545,I am alone.
00:25:05.670,00:25:07.005,I got my ass broken up with.
00:25:07.088,00:25:09.216,"-Oh, my God. -I'm gonna leave to California."
00:25:09.299,00:25:10.634,I'm not gonna see y'all.
00:25:12.093,00:25:14.012,This is a memory that you're gonna pass up?
00:25:14.095,00:25:14.930,"Oh, Jesus!"
00:25:15.013,00:25:18.600,"-Okay, yay! -A memory. A memory!"
00:25:18.683,00:25:19.893,That was a great performance.
00:25:21.728,00:25:23.230,"These are real tears, though."
00:25:26.775,00:25:29.861,Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair!
00:25:30.195,00:25:31.696,"Blair, boo-boo."
00:25:32.364,00:25:36.284,"Boo, watching you take down all these carbs has been the highlight of my whole, entire life."
00:25:36.368,00:25:37.577,I hate you. Both of you.
00:25:37.661,00:25:39.788,Me? What'd I do? I didn't do nothing.
00:25:42.999,00:25:48.713,"How is Matt Lasher in this motherfucking restaurant Oh, my God, look who it is."
00:25:49.089,00:25:50.632,"Jenny, wow, it's been a while."
00:25:50.882,00:25:52.842,"Blair, you look great. Erin!"
00:25:53.260,00:25:54.469,You still hate me. That's fine.
00:25:54.803,00:25:56.763,"So, what's up? You girls going to Neon Classic?"
00:25:56.846,00:25:57.973,"Yes. Yes, we are."
00:26:00.225,00:26:03.186,"It's, like, pretty crazy. Everyone and their mother is trying to get in."
00:26:03.270,00:26:05.021,"Like, my mom literally texted me."
00:26:05.105,00:26:06.189,Left her unread.
00:26:06.273,00:26:09.067,"I actually just got a job with Rolling Stone, so I think we're good."
00:26:09.150,00:26:10.902,"We got, like, channels that we can go through."
00:26:10.986,00:26:14.823,"Cool, if you have any, uh, problems or something, just, uh, you know, slide into my DMs."
00:26:17.284,00:26:18.827,"Bye. Good seeing you, Jen."
00:26:19.369,00:26:21.454,"What the fuck, dude?"
00:26:21.538,00:26:24.749,You need to get some lubricant and slide into his motherfucking DMs.
00:26:24.833,00:26:26.501,What if the Craigslist tickets fall through?
00:26:26.585,00:26:28.920,"What? No, we're fine. We're gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine."
00:26:31.798,00:26:33.925,He's kinda the perfect rebound.
00:26:34.009,00:26:35.844,It's only been a day. You need to grieve.
00:26:35.927,00:26:38.054,What you need is someone to fuck the Nate out of you.
00:26:38.138,00:26:41.975,Grief is an emotion best served with a side of stiff dick.
00:26:43.602,00:26:47.147,"I love you, but you've never even been in a long-term relationship."
00:26:47.397,00:26:52.652,"Blair, I love you, but you and Will are not exactly the second coming of Oprah and Gayle."
00:26:52.736,00:26:55.697,You know what I'm saying? You need to get fucked more than she does.
00:26:55.780,00:26:57.032,-Me? -Mm-hmm.
00:26:57.741,00:26:58.575,I fuck!
00:27:02.537,00:27:05.665,You don't even fuck yourself. I tried to use your Rabbit the other day.
00:27:05.749,00:27:07.667,That shit is dusty and the batteries are dead.
00:27:07.751,00:27:10.879,That's disgusting. I feel very attacked right now.
00:27:10.962,00:27:15.925,Would someone uptight give you the money to get the good molly from the guy that lives above the McDonald's near the bridge?
00:27:16.926,00:27:20.305,"Yes, Hype molly for us all, courtesy of your loosest friend."
00:27:21.598,00:27:24.643,"-Yeah, I heard it as I said it. Top grade. -Ah."
00:27:26.394,00:27:29.397,"-What up, you got stress-rhea? -That was one time."
00:27:30.106,00:27:33.276,I think it's a stretch calling an entire year of college one time.
00:27:35.612,00:27:37.405,Let's make this fast and get to Hype's.
00:27:39.658,00:27:41.576,Just in case this guy tries any funny business.
00:27:42.827,00:27:44.704,You shank that motherfucker with our mail key.
00:27:51.920,00:27:53.004,Come on in.
00:27:54.005,00:27:56.841,"Hey, I'm Mikey, by the way. And y'all are...?"
00:27:59.427,00:28:00.762,"Erin, wassup?"
00:28:01.096,00:28:02.972,"Welcome to my crib, come on in."
00:28:03.056,00:28:05.558,You can smoke anything on the table that you want.
00:28:05.642,00:28:08.186,"Everybody always asks, How do you afford this place?"
00:28:08.269,00:28:13.108,My parents got it for me two years ago before I broke off contact with them completely.
00:28:13.191,00:28:15.694,"Oh, I got pasta over there, by the way, if you want some."
00:28:15.777,00:28:17.195,"No, we just ate a really big lunch."
00:28:17.278,00:28:19.572,"Blair, I mean, you can't say no to a plate!"
00:28:19.656,00:28:22.450,"That's the spirit. Hey, what Harry Potter house are y'all?"
00:28:22.742,00:28:23.618,And don't lie.
00:28:23.702,00:28:26.329,"-I think we're all Ravenclaw. -Bitch, please. I'm Hufflepuff."
00:28:26.413,00:28:28.039,"-Eh. -Blair, low-key Slytherin."
00:28:28.164,00:28:31.251,"Technically, I identify as a Slytherin with a Ravenclaw moon."
00:28:33.920,00:28:35.296,"I'm Gryffindor, by the way."
00:28:36.673,00:28:38.049,"Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:28:38.133,00:28:40.051,"-This ain't what I think it is. -No, it is."
00:28:41.302,00:28:44.222,"Ooh-wee! This is the ace of spades of weed, y'all."
00:28:46.891,00:28:51.104,"That is, deadass, the best weed in the game right there."
00:28:51.187,00:28:53.231,I got that shit from Mike Dean's dude.
00:28:53.314,00:28:55.150,I only smoke shit that rappers do.
00:28:55.442,00:28:58.319,"I also got some shit that will give you a seizure, so be careful."
00:28:58.403,00:29:00.447,"It's mild, like the flavor of the weed."
00:29:00.530,00:29:03.199,"The seizure's not mild, it's very strong."
00:29:07.495,00:29:09.664,This is... Barbra Streisand.
00:29:13.293,00:29:15.003,You named your dog Barbra Streisand?
00:29:16.254,00:29:18.173,Why would I not name him Barbra Streisand?
00:29:18.256,00:29:21.468,"She's a legend, you know? And I love female directors, for real."
00:29:21.551,00:29:23.845,"because I truly do believe, like, time is up."
00:29:23.928,00:29:26.681,"As a matter of fact, time been up. You know? We're late."
00:29:26.765,00:29:29.184,-And Lady Bird? I love that shit. -I loved Lady Bird.
00:29:30.810,00:29:32.228,"That's so her, right?"
00:29:34.189,00:29:35.857,Y'all are so funny. I love you guys.
00:29:35.940,00:29:37.692,"For real, like, y'all want something to drink?"
00:29:37.942,00:29:44.699,"I'm drinking this expensive-ass tequila, but you gotta douse this shit in Sprite, because it low-key tastes like booty. No offense to the ass-eating community."
00:29:44.783,00:29:46.910,"No, thank you. Uh, we just really want the tickets."
00:29:49.287,00:29:51.748,"Um, so... It's, like, really funny, actually."
00:29:51.831,00:30:07.305,"My boy, Victor, came through earlier, and I gave him the tickets, and then y'all came, and I was like, Oh, hold up, like, They kinda cute, like, Let's see where this goes, maybe we can smoke a little something, drink a little something, you know, like maybe, we can fuck on each other."
00:30:13.478,00:30:15.855,"-You ain't got no tickets? -Yeah, no, I ain't got the tickets."
00:30:19.400,00:30:26.449,"All right! Let me at him! One minute! Let me just-- No, you can't play like that, man. I got early-onset osteoporosis."
00:30:26.533,00:30:29.744,"Look. Look at my wrist. I ain't got no bones in my wrist, man."
00:30:29.828,00:30:31.496,I was born with no bones in my left wrist.
00:30:34.290,00:30:36.209,I woulda gave it to you if you asked.
00:30:36.876,00:30:40.255,"But if you want to live your life by violence, go ahead."
00:30:43.550,00:30:44.801,Weirdo! Ugh!
00:30:48.221,00:30:49.514,-Yo. -Hm?
00:30:49.597,00:30:51.307,"I stole the Beyoncé weed, too."
00:30:51.850,00:30:53.518,"Oh, Bad Blair!"
00:30:53.601,00:30:54.727,-Bad Blair. -She back.
00:30:58.356,00:31:01.901,"Uh-huh. And if that doesn't work, we could, um, reach out to..."
00:31:01.985,00:31:03.278,What's that one dude's name...
00:31:06.823,00:31:08.116,What are you doing?
00:31:08.199,00:31:09.033,Hannah!
00:31:09.117,00:31:09.951,"Oh, shit!"
00:31:10.034,00:31:11.369,"Nate's cousin, Hannah?"
00:31:11.452,00:31:13.663,Fuck! I bet you she loves that we broke up.
00:31:13.746,00:31:15.707,"Oh, she's always calling me, sweetie, sweetheart."
00:31:15.790,00:31:18.626,"-She's coming. -No, she's not. She's-- Oh, yeah, she is."
00:31:18.710,00:31:20.003,-Okay. -Erin?
00:31:22.922,00:31:24.007,What's happening?
00:31:24.924,00:31:25.842,"Jenny, is that you?"
00:31:26.175,00:31:28.177,No. Huh? What?
00:31:29.721,00:31:30.555,Hannah?
00:31:31.306,00:31:33.808,I have not seen you in such a long time.
00:31:33.892,00:31:36.603,"Girl, how have you been? That's so weird. I didn't even see you."
00:31:37.437,00:31:39.147,What are you wearing?
00:31:40.231,00:31:41.232,It's so '90s.
00:31:44.527,00:31:45.445,...chic.
00:31:46.946,00:31:49.490,"We're doing a piece at Vogue, and you're just, like, killing it."
00:31:49.574,00:31:51.743,It's about people who don't care what they look like.
00:31:52.827,00:31:58.333,"Amazing. Amazing. You're, like, nailing the exact aesthetic I've been trying to convey to the photographer."
00:31:58.416,00:32:02.879,"Oh, my God, so funny running into you. I was just about to text Nate about what time you guys are going to Neon Classic."
00:32:03.296,00:32:09.093,"I mean, I wasn't even gonna go, but Kim was like, Oh, you know, you never fucking come out anymore, and Kanye wants to see you, so..."
00:32:09.594,00:32:12.013,"You know. Oh, my God, shit! That was supposed to be a surprise."
00:32:12.347,00:32:17.101,"I'm sorry, you-- you were saying that Nate-- Wait. Kanye's the-- -Kanye's the secret headliner? -Shh!"
00:32:17.185,00:32:18.019,That's insane!
00:32:18.102,00:32:19.228,And a problematic choice.
00:32:22.065,00:32:25.276,"We broke up, yesterday, uh, last night. And, um, yeah."
00:32:26.569,00:32:27.403,It's over.
00:32:33.993,00:32:34.911,"Oh, it's okay."
00:32:34.994,00:32:36.621,"No, it's gonna be okay."
00:32:37.246,00:32:38.957,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:32:40.750,00:32:42.210,That's really crunchy.
00:32:43.378,00:32:45.171,It's like-- Is that new denim?
00:32:45.254,00:32:49.550,"You know, if you need anything from me, just do not hesitate to contact my assistant."
00:32:49.634,00:32:50.510,Text is better.
00:32:50.843,00:32:51.928,You'll get me faster.
00:32:52.011,00:32:52.845,Thank you.
00:32:59.978,00:33:01.813,Uh... J-Bug.
00:33:03.147,00:33:05.441,She was saying something about Nate and Neon Classic.
00:33:05.525,00:33:06.901,"You wanna, like, talk about that?"
00:33:06.985,00:33:09.237,Bam! Matt got us three wristbands.
00:33:09.320,00:33:11.739,What you know about that? And a tongue emoji. He sucks.
00:33:14.993,00:33:16.327,I don't even know what she's talking about.
00:33:16.411,00:33:18.621,"But who cares, right? Who cares about Nate?"
00:33:18.746,00:33:21.499,"The only thing that matters is us living our best life, right?"
00:33:21.582,00:33:27.296,"Living our best life. So, on to pressing matters, who wants to go to booty-hole Brooklyn to get these wristbands?"
00:33:27.380,00:33:29.590,-I will rock-paper-scissors-- -I can do it.
00:33:46.691,00:33:47.692,"Hey, Blair."
00:33:50.737,00:33:54.115,that you just couldn't put us on the list for these wristbands.
00:33:56.325,00:33:58.286,That's not true. There's always a list.
00:33:58.369,00:33:59.537,"So, you decided to come alone?"
00:33:59.620,00:34:01.664,Nobody else wanted to come to this weird office.
00:34:02.373,00:34:03.916,"What do you even do here, Matt?"
00:34:04.000,00:34:05.209,Literally nothing.
00:34:12.300,00:34:13.384,You look really good.
00:34:14.552,00:34:15.386,No.
00:34:16.012,00:34:16.888,Don't do that.
00:34:16.971,00:34:20.058,"Oh, come on, you wouldn't even be here if you didn't want me to, you know..."
00:34:20.641,00:34:21.476,do that.
00:34:25.772,00:34:27.482,Does Jenny know about... us?
00:34:27.982,00:34:29.275,There is nothing to know.
00:34:30.026,00:34:30.860,Funny.
00:34:42.497,00:34:43.915,a drunken night like...
00:34:45.291,00:34:46.125,When was it?
00:34:47.418,00:34:49.504,Two years ago? That I...
00:34:55.593,00:34:57.845,You looked so incredible in those tights.
00:35:17.156,00:35:18.157,Whatever you say.
00:35:24.914,00:35:29.293,"We shouldn't. We shou-- I mean, if you really want me to stop, I'll stop."
00:35:35.842,00:35:37.552,"Coming, my darlings!"
00:35:38.177,00:35:39.470,Coming!
00:35:41.389,00:35:42.807,-Hi! -Hi!
00:35:45.268,00:35:47.854,"Ah! I just got out of the shower, so don't mind me."
00:35:47.937,00:35:50.815,"-You smell delicious. It's been so long. -Well, you never call me!"
00:35:50.898,00:35:53.109,"I mean, what, you don't do drugs anymore or what?"
00:35:53.192,00:35:55.069,We can't afford your shit. You know that already.
00:35:57.029,00:35:59.031,"Child, you know I love you and I miss you."
00:36:04.745,00:36:07.874,Oh! Are these baby sharks?
00:36:10.084,00:36:11.836,"Yes, they're so tiny!"
00:36:11.919,00:36:13.337,I feel like they're my children.
00:36:13.421,00:36:15.423,"I got 'em illegally, so don't tell nobody."
00:36:17.049,00:36:20.511,Acting like anybody's gonna care if they come up here with all your drogas.
00:36:20.595,00:36:23.181,"Come on, now. Baby sharks is the least of your worries."
00:36:26.267,00:36:27.560,-What? -Uh-huh.
00:36:30.104,00:36:32.148,-So you going to the big show tonight? -You know it.
00:36:32.231,00:36:33.941,Lotta people been through here today.
00:36:34.025,00:36:35.276,I'm sure. Neon Classic!
00:36:35.359,00:36:36.986,What's with this outfit?
00:36:37.069,00:36:39.572,"-I mean, you look crazy, -What?"
00:36:39.739,00:36:41.782,"but at the same time, you look real sexy."
00:36:44.285,00:36:45.494,Your girl is having a day.
00:36:45.578,00:36:48.039,Can you just not? Can we not do that? Not right now.
00:36:49.749,00:36:52.001,-Nate broke up with her last night. -No!
00:36:52.960,00:36:53.961,Girl!
00:36:54.170,00:36:55.254,"Oh, my God, he's so hot."
00:36:57.840,00:36:59.926,"Are you devastated? Girl, 'cause I would be devastated."
00:37:00.343,00:37:02.970,"-I'm okay. -No, you're not."
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.181,I can see the sadness in your eyes.
00:37:05.932,00:37:06.766,You know what?
00:37:10.269,00:37:12.605,-Jesus! -I thought you pulled out another puppy.
00:37:14.774,00:37:16.692,Ah! It's the holy grail of joints.
00:37:16.776,00:37:18.569,How? How do you even roll something like this?
00:37:18.653,00:37:21.239,"-Well, it takes a strong will. -Mm."
00:37:22.990,00:37:25.284,"Now, that's happy medicine right there, girl."
00:37:35.211,00:37:36.671,Let it all go away...
00:37:36.754,00:37:39.298,and think about happy times.
00:37:43.344,00:37:44.303,You're smart.
00:37:46.430,00:37:47.390,"Let me see, let me see."
00:37:47.473,00:37:49.600,Gimme all the food. All the food.
00:37:50.434,00:37:52.103,Mixed vegetable with bean curd.
00:37:53.562,00:37:54.647,What is bean curd?
00:37:59.568,00:38:01.362,"¿Qué tú quieres, papá? Dímelo."
00:38:01.612,00:38:03.155,Vamos a practicar español. Huh?
00:38:07.827,00:38:08.661,What?
00:38:13.040,00:38:13.874,I love you.
00:38:21.549,00:38:22.967,I... That was stupid.
00:38:29.974,00:38:30.808,"Ah, shit."
00:38:31.142,00:38:33.519,"No, that was amazing, and I... and... and..."
00:38:34.145,00:38:36.772,"And that was amazing, and you are really... and..."
00:38:37.064,00:38:38.524,and I just don't know...
00:38:39.692,00:38:41.485,um... what to say back.
00:38:41.569,00:38:43.279,"No, that's cool. It's all right."
00:38:45.031,00:38:46.741,It's okay. I mean... Yeah.
00:38:47.825,00:38:49.910,"-I'm sorry. -Aw, I fucked it up, didn't I?"
00:38:52.204,00:38:53.706,"Well, is it okay? Is that okay?"
00:39:03.215,00:39:05.009,...Kung Pao chicken.
00:39:08.929,00:39:10.097,"It's-- It's fine, baby."
00:39:21.692,00:39:22.568,Let's go.
00:39:30.659,00:39:33.579,"Oh, you wanna play kitty-cat, don't you? I can play that."
00:39:34.455,00:39:37.249,"Say, uh, what are you doing later, baby?"
00:39:49.470,00:40:04.068,Wait. Come here. I need to-- -I love you. I like saying it. -Mm.
00:40:04.860,00:40:05.694,I love you.
00:40:05.778,00:40:07.446,"-I lurve you. -I love you too, baby."
00:40:07.530,00:40:08.823,"I love ya, baby."
00:40:11.450,00:40:12.785,"I love you so much, baby."
00:40:12.868,00:40:13.702,I love you.
00:40:24.547,00:40:25.756,Can I use your bathroom?
00:40:26.382,00:40:27.299,Gimme the joint first.
00:40:27.383,00:40:29.427,"-Oh, you right. -It's the door on the left down there."
00:40:29.510,00:40:30.344,All right.
00:40:35.558,00:40:39.562,Because I can feel so much love in your eyes.
00:40:40.020,00:40:42.273,"Girl, this just can't be where it ends."
00:40:42.731,00:40:43.899,Trust and believe.
00:40:45.317,00:40:46.318,I'm also clairvoyant.
00:40:46.986,00:40:47.945,Ain't that ghosts?
00:40:50.114,00:40:55.411,"And I know, I know in my heart of hearts, that you want your man back."
00:40:55.494,00:40:57.538,"So, girl, you gon' go get your man."
00:40:57.621,00:40:59.915,"Aight, homie, we gotta go get these Neon Classic outfits."
00:40:59.999,00:41:00.875,Okay.
00:41:03.878,00:41:04.753,How much?
00:41:05.671,00:41:06.505,Forty.
00:41:08.215,00:41:10.384,And one free for sad Jenny.
00:41:14.555,00:41:16.682,"Oh, thank you, Hype."
00:41:17.141,00:41:17.975,"Thanks, Hype."
00:41:25.941,00:41:28.277,"I have a boyfriend, and my best friend used to like you."
00:41:28.360,00:41:29.570,"Yeah, in college."
00:41:29.820,00:41:30.738,"Oh, come on, Blair."
00:41:30.821,00:41:33.073,You can't possibly be using the friend thing on me right now.
00:41:33.157,00:41:34.158,Jenny hates me.
00:41:34.325,00:41:37.244,"Yeah, she hates you, which means the feelings might still be there."
00:41:37.578,00:41:38.579,Should I give her a call?
00:41:38.913,00:41:39.747,"Oh, my God."
00:41:41.874,00:41:50.591,"Oh, my God, Blair, you seem like you would be a total nightmare to date, but I'm head-over-heels for your fucking crazy mind. Take these."
00:41:50.674,00:41:53.052,-I have no idea how to respond to that. -It was a compliment.
00:41:58.516,00:41:59.642,You have a very...
00:42:00.434,00:42:02.686,"very nice smile, and it makes me feel fucking confused."
00:42:06.440,00:42:07.983,Those wristbands are just GA.
00:42:08.067,00:42:10.569,"I couldn't really swing any more VIP, but..."
00:42:10.736,00:42:13.030,I put you guys on the list for the party.
00:42:17.159,00:42:18.869,Are you fucking kidding me?
00:42:18.953,00:42:19.828,I'm afraid not.
00:42:19.912,00:42:22.706,That was not GA intercourse.
00:42:27.962,00:42:28.796,"Bye, Blair."
00:42:53.237,00:42:55.614,I'm not. This is great. I'm happy to see her.
00:42:56.907,00:42:59.243,Hey. I didn't think I'd see you today.
00:42:59.326,00:43:03.372,"Leah, 911, an emergency. I-- I just need my whole shit fixed."
00:43:03.789,00:43:05.583,Breakup discount. Thirty off the whole store.
00:43:05.666,00:43:06.500,Go nuts.
00:43:07.501,00:43:08.544,"Oh, oh, oh!"
00:43:12.548,00:43:14.383,I like that you're wearing my shirt.
00:43:15.301,00:43:17.011,"You know, it's a good shirt."
00:43:18.053,00:43:22.850,"You know, in keeping with my promise from this morning, you still owe me an answer."
00:43:24.560,00:43:26.937,I thought I would make it easy on you. Brunch this Sunday.
00:43:27.396,00:43:29.231,"Jaclyn, Keelie, and Amanda are already alerted."
00:43:29.315,00:43:30.941,They're very excited to meet you.
00:43:31.025,00:43:31.900,Oh...
00:43:39.825,00:43:41.327,"Um, uh..."
00:43:41.410,00:43:43.037,"Sunday... Sunday, Sunday, Sunday."
00:43:43.120,00:43:46.957,Sunday. What day is Sunday? I gotta check my schedule.
00:43:47.041,00:43:48.667,You know you don't have a schedule.
00:43:49.084,00:43:49.918,Erin!
00:43:50.294,00:43:52.671,-Can you help me in the dressing room? -Yes.
00:43:52.755,00:43:55.341,"Yes, I can, girl. Mm-hmm."
00:43:55.758,00:43:56.592,I gotta go.
00:43:59.386,00:44:01.430,"-So... -Okay, great. I bet you do."
00:44:05.184,00:44:06.602,Jesus!
00:44:06.727,00:44:08.395,"What, are you gonna try on the whole store?"
00:44:11.231,00:44:13.609,You deserve that. What are you doing out there?
00:44:13.692,00:44:15.152,Why are you being weird with Leah?
00:44:15.235,00:44:17.655,I dunno. Sometimes a bitch don't feel like brunchin'.
00:44:18.739,00:44:20.991,That is deadass the craziest shit I've ever heard you say.
00:44:21.075,00:44:23.952,You are a brunch queen. I call lies. Lies-ah Minnelli.
00:44:25.287,00:44:26.872,It's none of your business.
00:44:33.003,00:44:36.632,"I love you, and I know you're going through it today, but there's nothing to fix here."
00:44:37.383,00:44:38.217,All right?
00:44:57.778,00:44:59.947,I wasn't even looking at my phone that much.
00:45:00.114,00:45:03.826,"Literally, every time I turned around and looked up, you were looking down."
00:45:07.663,00:45:12.626,"and the whole time, -you're looking at your phone. -Do you think I like being the shitty, fucking downer girlfriend?"
00:45:12.710,00:45:15.003,"-Fuck it, let's go home. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:45:15.087,00:45:16.088,I don't want to go home.
00:45:19.967,00:45:22.219,Let's go back to that party. I want to talk to everybody.
00:45:22.302,00:45:24.513,"I wanna-- I want to be exactly what you want, Nate."
00:45:24.596,00:45:27.391,I could be 20-year-old Jenny again with no responsibilities.
00:45:27.474,00:45:29.560,"Then maybe you'll still love me, huh?"
00:45:29.643,00:45:31.854,"-Don't fucking laugh at me! Fuck you! -What is this, Jen?"
00:45:31.937,00:45:34.273,Since when do you give a shit about the people you work with?
00:45:34.356,00:45:36.650,You gonna get all close to these new fucking worker friends?
00:45:38.068,00:45:40.821,You're gonna tell me I don't love you when you're the one moving across country?
00:45:43.449,00:45:45.075,"Wow, you turn it around on me."
00:45:45.159,00:45:47.536,I did not turn this around on you! You attacked me!
00:45:50.414,00:45:52.458,Why do you keep saying fucking to me?
00:45:52.541,00:45:53.584,-Fuck! Fuck! -Fuck! Fuck!
00:45:53.667,00:45:54.877,-Fuck! Fuck! -Fuck! Fuck!
00:45:54.960,00:45:56.295,"-Fuck! -Fuck you, Nate!"
00:45:58.547,00:46:02.801,"See, your insecurities are manifesting themselves in a really ugly way right now."
00:46:08.140,00:46:10.684,"-I'm not doing shit. -I am a grown-ass woman, all right?"
00:46:11.310,00:46:12.352,I don't need you.
00:46:14.730,00:46:16.106,"Yeah, you never do."
00:46:18.817,00:46:19.943,You never fucking do.
00:47:19.461,00:47:20.712,"Oh, baby."
00:48:36.914,00:48:39.666,"-I love you so much. -I love you, too."
00:48:51.178,00:48:52.137,You're my person.
00:48:55.432,00:48:56.266,Forever.
00:49:15.160,00:49:16.078,Oh.
00:49:35.639,00:49:36.848,"Oh, shoot! Baby, you okay?"
00:49:47.567,00:49:48.443,Ooh.
00:49:48.652,00:49:52.698,"I'm sorry, I was just here cleaning up a little bit 'cause I know how busy you've been."
00:49:52.781,00:49:53.782,You busy bee.
00:49:53.865,00:49:55.659,"You were in my-- my room, cleaning it?"
00:50:02.457,00:50:03.291,Will.
00:50:04.292,00:50:05.127,Let's talk.
00:50:11.675,00:50:12.509,Take those off.
00:50:20.183,00:50:21.226,Are you happy?
00:50:26.189,00:50:28.650,'Cause I don't know if I'm happy anymore.
00:50:35.073,00:50:36.533,"Oh, my God!"
00:50:37.617,00:50:39.453,"Wow, that is so good to hear."
00:50:43.957,00:50:46.126,I haven't been happy for such a long time!
00:50:52.632,00:50:55.510,"Yeah. Honestly, I almost cheated on you last week."
00:50:55.886,00:50:57.596,-Lint. -With who?
00:50:57.679,00:50:59.264,"Uh, Brenda from work."
00:51:01.558,00:51:02.392,Great!
00:51:03.268,00:51:04.102,Well...
00:51:05.979,00:51:07.314,"I guess this is it, then."
00:51:07.773,00:51:08.607,I guess.
00:51:14.863,00:51:17.240,"I don't know. We were just together for so long, I..."
00:51:20.535,00:51:23.080,"But I do love you, Blair, and I always will."
00:51:24.122,00:51:24.956,"I love you, too."
00:51:42.474,00:51:45.185,"And Will, please don't go back in my bedroom and finish cleaning."
00:52:03.787,00:52:05.455,"-Wake up, bitch! -Where's my bra?"
00:52:05.872,00:52:06.790,"Oh, shit."
00:52:07.124,00:52:07.958,Fuck.
00:52:08.041,00:52:11.586,I was just having the weirdest fucking dream about Michael Cera.
00:52:13.463,00:52:16.424,Um... I... I have news.
00:52:19.469,00:52:23.223,"I don't want to make today about me, okay? So just don't tell Jenny."
00:52:25.892,00:52:27.686,Hi. Morning.
00:52:27.769,00:52:30.939,"Hey, dude. Do you feel horrible?"
00:52:33.150,00:52:36.444,"Oh, I wanna take, like, a million naps. Go, tell me all your secrets!"
00:52:36.528,00:52:37.445,Spill the tea.
00:52:37.988,00:52:40.198,I... broke up with Will.
00:52:40.699,00:52:42.242,"-I'm sorry, what? -What?"
00:52:42.325,00:52:43.702,I did. I broke up with him.
00:52:44.286,00:52:47.330,He was cleaning our apartment when I got there.
00:52:47.831,00:52:52.043,"So, like, did you break up with him before or after he got to my room, though?"
00:52:52.127,00:52:53.044,Pause.
00:52:53.503,00:52:54.880,What happened? How are you feeling?
00:52:54.963,00:52:58.300,"I mean, like, that kind of throws off your whole married-before-30s steez."
00:52:59.926,00:53:05.724,"I know. I-- I feel like I thought I was going to be freaking out, and I am a little bit, but I mostly feel..."
00:53:06.099,00:53:06.933,amazing.
00:53:07.267,00:53:10.854,I do. And I'm so sorry to bring this into the mix with everything happening with you and Nate.
00:53:10.937,00:53:12.939,-And I don't wanna make this-- -What? No. Uh-uh. No.
00:53:13.023,00:53:16.568,"That is-- They are completely different, and I'm happy for you."
00:53:16.651,00:53:17.485,"Ah, yeah."
00:53:17.569,00:53:20.739,"You deserve better. And he does, too, no offense."
00:53:20.822,00:53:23.366,"-No, he does. He definitely does. -Hey."
00:53:28.955,00:53:31.958,Bad Blair is not available. She's not here right now.
00:53:32.042,00:53:34.419,-Bad Blair came out a bit earlier today. -What time is it?
00:53:37.130,00:53:39.424,"-No. Bad Blair died at, like-- -Oh, oh, oh!"
00:53:48.975,00:53:50.936,"Gentle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:53:55.649,00:53:57.776,Yes! Come on!
00:53:57.859,00:53:59.903,"Oh, shit, y'all. We need to get ready."
00:53:59.986,00:54:03.615,"I brought, like, 400 outfit choices. Now that I am single, I need opinions."
00:54:03.698,00:54:05.492,"Oh, my God, holy shit."
00:54:06.243,00:54:07.619,"You guys, I am single."
00:54:07.702,00:54:11.248,"Wait, wait, wait, putas! I have something for you, perritas."
00:54:15.043,00:54:18.672,Is this our Bitches and Bangers playlist from college?
00:54:18.755,00:54:19.881,"Yes, it is."
00:54:22.300,00:54:25.178,My head feels like shit. Let's go!
00:54:27.597,00:54:30.392,"Oh, my God, I feel like you're gonna give me a high five."
00:55:44.674,00:55:47.218,I am deeply obsessed with us right now.
00:55:52.098,00:55:54.684,Yo. Ice cream is ice cream. That shit is sugar.
00:55:55.018,00:55:56.936,"-Sugar's where it's at. -Gimme that sugar, though."
00:55:58.480,00:56:01.024,"-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! -Let's get that DC."
00:56:01.107,00:56:02.984,"-I got you, boo. -How 'bout we drink some water?"
00:56:03.068,00:56:06.279,"-We've been drinking a lot of alcohol. -Oh, my God!"
00:56:27.217,00:56:28.635,They can't be playing this song right now.
00:56:29.386,00:56:32.013,"Oh, shit. You know what? We don't need this bullshit."
00:56:32.097,00:56:33.640,"-Come on. Let's go. -No, no, no, no, no."
00:56:38.144,00:56:40.688,"You know what, Blair, how about you get the snacks?"
00:56:40.772,00:56:42.732,"-Yeah, totally. -And we'll meet you outside."
00:56:48.279,00:56:49.364,-It's okay. -Yeah?
00:56:49.447,00:56:50.281,Yeah.
00:56:51.199,00:56:52.033,It's okay.
00:57:23.356,00:57:25.608,get some snacks while she sings it out.
00:57:32.449,00:57:33.408,You want string cheese?
00:57:50.675,00:57:51.509,Uh-uh.
00:57:55.805,00:57:56.723,Blair.
00:57:59.684,00:58:02.312,What the fuck are you doing? Pay for the string cheese and get out!
00:58:02.770,00:58:03.730,You're scaring my cat.
00:58:04.105,00:58:05.648,You know what? Fuck you!
00:58:07.400,00:58:08.818,This ain't no karaoke bar!
00:58:08.902,00:58:10.695,"Well, why'd you play the fucking music so loud?"
00:58:10.778,00:58:13.114,Shh. Here's a twenty. I'm so sorry to disturb you.
00:58:13.323,00:58:15.158,Thank you. Have a lovely evening.
00:58:15.575,00:58:22.665,"You cannot anger your bodega man. I did that one time, and now I have to walk three extra blocks to go to the next one, -and it's a literal nightmare. -Give me the molly."
00:58:22.999,00:58:25.835,"Um, we're still super visible right now. Do you..."
00:58:26.753,00:58:27.587,"Yeah, you right."
00:58:32.425,00:58:33.259,I...
00:58:38.056,00:58:39.182,-She seems... -Yup.
01:00:06.352,01:00:08.313,I don't know. I figured we'd know everyone.
01:00:08.396,01:00:10.398,Everybody we know moved to LA.
01:00:10.481,01:00:12.984,-Fuck LA. -Says the girl moving to San Francisco.
01:00:13.067,01:00:14.611,-Oh! -Totally different.
01:00:14.694,01:00:17.071,Should we try to slip into VIP since Matt totally fucked you?
01:00:17.155,01:00:18.615,What? He didn't fuck me.
01:00:19.449,01:00:21.784,"GA wristbands? Yeah, he did."
01:00:21.951,01:00:23.786,"Yeah, yeah, he fucked us on the wristbands."
01:00:26.331,01:00:27.165,What you doing?
01:00:27.248,01:00:30.752,"Hmm? What? Nothing. I think I'm feeling this molly, y'all."
01:00:34.964,01:00:36.466,How old do you think that guy over there is?
01:00:40.094,01:00:43.514,Girl! I think he bought these tickets with bar mitzvah money.
01:00:44.724,01:00:46.809,"Fuck you, too, baby, come on!"
01:00:46.893,01:00:48.519,"-Yes! -Thank you, Erin!"
01:00:48.603,01:00:50.104,-Jessie Reyez is setting up. -Oh!
01:00:50.188,01:00:52.899,"Excuse me, we know her. Yes, we're best friends. We're cousins."
01:00:52.982,01:00:53.858,Excuse me.
01:01:26.099,01:01:27.225,I'm gonna go talk to him.
01:01:27.809,01:01:30.311,I can't let you do that. You'll thank me later.
01:01:31.813,01:01:34.691,"What do you mean, you can't let me do it? I make my own decisions. Come on."
01:01:36.025,01:01:38.444,"Hey, come on! Stop dancing in my way, Erin!"
01:01:38.778,01:01:41.280,"Bitch, you ain't shit. I knew you were coming here to see Nate."
01:01:42.281,01:01:45.076,-What are you guys talking about? -She came here tonight to see Nate!
01:01:45.576,01:01:47.161,"No, no, Jenny, no."
01:01:49.330,01:01:52.333,"Blair, but I'm a grown-ass adult, all right? I make my own decisions."
01:02:02.635,01:02:04.303,"Just stop following me, then."
01:02:07.432,01:02:13.354,-I just need to go to the bathroom. -I've known you long enough to know that you are definitely not just going to the bathroom right now.
01:02:13.438,01:02:15.273,-Oh? -I love you so much.
01:02:15.481,01:02:18.192,But this is getting fucking pathetic. He broke up with you.
01:02:18.276,01:02:20.570,"My heart was ripped out of my chest, okay?"
01:02:20.653,01:02:23.948,But... it's not like I'd expect you to know what that feels like.
01:02:24.031,01:02:29.662,"I can't get mad at you for not understanding, but I sure as hell can be mad at you for not being a friend to me right now, Erin."
01:02:31.956,01:02:32.790,We're good!
01:02:33.416,01:02:35.042,-We're at Neon Classic! -Uh...
01:02:35.376,01:02:36.711,I feel great. You feel great?
01:02:36.794,01:02:38.337,-Trying to. -We look great!
01:02:38.880,01:02:40.673,"You're pretty, you're pretty."
01:02:42.175,01:02:43.134,We're having fun!
01:02:45.178,01:02:47.180,This is our song! We love this song!
01:02:47.263,01:02:48.473,-We do. We love this song. -We do.
01:02:48.556,01:02:51.142,"Why don't you go listen to it, okay? 'Cause I don't need a babysitter."
01:02:51.476,01:02:53.644,"-You're kinda acting like a baby. -Fuck you, Blair."
01:02:53.728,01:02:55.688,Fuck you. I'm trying to stay neutral here.
01:02:57.523,01:02:59.025,"Thought you had to piss, princess."
01:03:19.378,01:03:21.255,Fuck. Fuck!
01:03:21.672,01:03:23.382,Fuck me!
01:03:26.219,01:03:28.221,Wait. Ugh. Ugh.
01:03:29.347,01:03:30.223,Nah.
01:03:50.034,01:03:51.786,I don't want you to end us.
01:03:55.748,01:03:58.125,"I know, baby. I don't want to end us."
01:03:59.001,01:04:01.087,-I love you. -I love you.
01:04:01.712,01:04:04.048,I'm sorry about San Francisco.
01:04:05.216,01:04:08.511,"I can't turn down this opportunity, but we can try long distance."
01:04:09.554,01:04:11.514,You know it's not all about that.
01:04:12.056,01:04:14.433,This isn't working anymore. You know that.
01:04:15.893,01:04:18.145,I feel like we need to live our own lives.
01:04:18.646,01:04:20.898,"Ever since college, we're all we've known."
01:04:27.738,01:04:29.991,But what if we're meant to be together?
01:04:37.123,01:04:41.627,"No matter what happens, I-- I feel like we're always gonna be in each other's lives, so..."
01:04:42.962,01:04:45.339,"It's fine. I mean, I-- It will be okay."
01:04:59.353,01:05:00.187,Look at me.
01:05:31.510,01:05:37.850,I-- Can I-- Can I just have a minute?
01:07:59.325,01:08:01.869,"-You over the show already? -Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me."
01:08:05.581,01:08:07.166,I just came to get some air.
01:08:07.917,01:08:09.919,Okay. Air's that way.
01:08:11.295,01:08:12.880,"You know, you can't smoke in here."
01:08:13.130,01:08:15.883,"Oh, my God. What are you, security? I'm by the door."
01:08:25.643,01:08:27.978,"Look, I got a car coming to pick me up in about a minute."
01:08:28.062,01:08:30.648,Taking me to the House of Yes. Why don't you come with me?
01:08:31.065,01:08:33.317,"I don't need a rebound, Matt."
01:08:34.318,01:08:36.403,I'm not offering sex.
01:08:36.487,01:08:39.532,I'm-- I'm literally just offering you a ride to the after-party.
01:08:41.367,01:08:44.787,"My phone isn't working, and Erin and Blair are still inside, so..."
01:08:44.870,01:08:46.205,"No, that's cool. I'll text them."
01:08:46.622,01:08:47.456,Let's go.
01:09:57.943,01:10:04.074,"Jenny, I know your fucking phone is dead, and you need to find a charge, and you better call us back. You're being such a fucking asshole!"
01:10:04.158,01:10:07.036,"We just really want to be there for you, so we just need you to call us."
01:10:07.119,01:10:09.121,We love you. We love you so much.
01:10:10.080,01:10:12.750,-What the fuck was that? -She's not gonna respond to that.
01:10:12.833,01:10:14.793,-You can't yell at her. -I don't care.
01:10:16.170,01:10:17.213,She needs to grow up.
01:10:19.465,01:10:20.466,What-- What was that?
01:10:21.300,01:10:27.264,"I mean, it's kind of the pot telling the kettle to grow up, but... I don't know, never mind."
01:10:31.936,01:10:33.062,"-Oh, really? -Mm."
01:10:34.313,01:10:36.065,You're late to work every day.
01:10:36.523,01:10:37.691,Not every day.
01:10:37.942,01:10:40.486,You go out on workdays more than you go out on weekends!
01:10:40.569,01:10:42.279,Because it's bridge and tunnel.
01:10:42.363,01:10:44.907,"Erin, you're holding onto something that is gone."
01:10:44.990,01:10:46.617,Do you think you're gonna be young forever?
01:10:46.700,01:10:48.911,We're almost 30 years old. It's not cute anymore.
01:10:48.994,01:10:51.705,Don't you have personal goals? Do you have a plan for the future?
01:10:51.789,01:10:53.791,"How did your plan work out? Oh, right."
01:10:53.874,01:10:56.502,It was completely fucking insane and backfired.
01:10:56.585,01:10:57.670,It did not backfire!
01:10:57.753,01:10:59.129,We can't fuck around anymore!
01:10:59.213,01:11:03.259,I want a best friend who wants to get up with me every Saturday morning and go to the farmers market.
01:11:03.342,01:11:05.719,And you sleep through the farmers market every weekend.
01:11:05.803,01:11:07.680,"Is that what being an adult means to you, Blair?"
01:11:07.763,01:11:10.182,Going to the fucking farmers market? What else? Tell me more!
01:11:10.266,01:11:15.271,"-Tell me your ways. -Admitting that you like Leah, and you want to be in a relationship with her."
01:11:16.438,01:11:19.358,-What are you so afraid of? -Everything!
01:11:21.819,01:11:24.154,"If I grow up, it means I need to change..."
01:11:24.780,01:11:26.156,everything!
01:11:26.991,01:11:29.285,"Everything's already fucking changing, Blair!"
01:11:29.368,01:11:30.577,Jenny's leaving.
01:11:33.080,01:11:36.292,"And actually, the farmers market sounds really, really like..."
01:11:36.375,01:11:39.003,"assuring, and coddling, and comforting right now."
01:11:39.086,01:11:40.754,"Like, is there one tomorrow?"
01:11:43.507,01:11:48.721,"All I feel right now is, like, just love for you coursing through my veins, and I just want to hug it out."
01:11:48.804,01:11:51.932,"-Me too. I just want to hug you. -Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
01:12:03.986,01:12:04.987,She's with Matt.
01:12:05.070,01:12:06.238,-Oh. -I have an address.
01:12:07.865,01:12:09.158,-Hoo! -Yeah.
01:12:10.701,01:12:11.535,All right.
01:12:12.828,01:12:13.871,I gotta make a pit stop.
01:12:13.954,01:12:14.913,Okay.
01:12:33.057,01:12:34.350,"Oh, shit dicks."
01:12:35.434,01:12:40.397,"Shit. Here, here, here. Let me help you. Let me get-- No! No, no. Nope, no, no."
01:12:40.481,01:12:42.483,"Big-- Big girl, grown-up here."
01:12:42.566,01:12:43.442,I'm sorry!
01:12:43.776,01:12:45.027,You know this is all your fault.
01:12:45.861,01:12:47.029,"Oh, yeah? Enlighten me."
01:12:47.112,01:12:49.990,"Well, if you had just dated me in college, I would never have met Nate."
01:12:50.074,01:12:53.243,-And I wouldn't be completely heartbroken. -I was dumb in college.
01:12:53.327,01:12:55.746,You know I fucked several different women that straight-up stole from me?
01:12:56.288,01:12:59.166,"Oh, wow! I was so obsessed with you in college."
01:12:59.249,01:13:03.170,"I spent so much time thinking about you, and crying over you, and..."
01:13:04.797,01:13:10.594,it just makes me realize that what I felt for you wasn't even real because it definitely didn't feel like this.
01:13:11.387,01:13:13.263,Come on. You're looking at it all wrong.
01:13:13.555,01:13:16.058,You've been blessed with a broken heart.
01:13:16.308,01:13:18.727,"When it doesn't hurt anymore, that's when it's really over."
01:13:18.811,01:13:20.521,Live in this as long as you can.
01:13:24.233,01:13:25.067,I gotta go.
01:13:26.193,01:13:27.027,Really?
01:13:27.194,01:13:30.114,Tell Erin and Blair that I am going to finish it.
01:13:32.533,01:13:33.409,That makes no sense.
01:13:33.659,01:13:40.040,"Oh, right. You're-- -Are you cool? You're okay? -I'm gonna be okay."
01:13:40.124,01:13:41.667,"All right. Hey, Young!"
01:13:42.835,01:13:45.295,I'm sorry I was such an asshole in college.
01:13:46.463,01:13:49.133,Don't be. You helped me find Nate.
01:13:58.058,01:13:59.560,-Hi! -You okay?
01:13:59.768,01:14:01.145,"-Yeah. -Shit, you're rich."
01:14:01.228,01:14:04.440,"Everything's, uh, great. I just need to, like, talk to you right now."
01:14:04.523,01:14:06.567,She wants to go to the farmers market with you.
01:14:09.069,01:14:11.405,"No, like... like, normal farmers market..."
01:14:11.488,01:14:12.656,-Functioning hours. -Yeah.
01:14:13.532,01:14:14.950,-It's real. -Mm-hmm.
01:14:16.994,01:14:18.537,"-Thank you. -Oh, my God, her skin!"
01:14:19.788,01:14:20.622,"Okay, boo."
01:14:20.706,01:14:23.417,-Yeah. -How you feeling? You still...
01:14:24.001,01:14:25.544,"-Yeah. Oh, my God. -Yeah."
01:14:25.627,01:14:28.130,-I feel like it's gotten more intense. -I can see that.
01:14:28.213,01:14:29.047,-Yeah. -Yeah.
01:14:29.798,01:14:33.302,"So, I am going to play you some really great music."
01:14:33.385,01:14:37.014,"Okay? You just let it, like, wash over you, all right?"
01:14:37.097,01:14:40.809,"Just let it, like, move you wherever you wanna go, okay?"
01:14:40.893,01:14:44.813,"And whatever you do, do not take the headphones out until I tell you to."
01:14:53.030,01:14:53.864,Perfect.
01:14:55.491,01:14:56.617,"You got it, girl."
01:14:57.868,01:15:00.078,Whoo! All right. Let's have a...
01:15:00.662,01:15:01.497,Yeah...
01:15:01.872,01:15:03.582,-A seat... Sit... A seat... -Okay.
01:15:05.751,01:15:08.212,"-Are you rolling? -I am, I am definitely rolling."
01:15:08.295,01:15:12.257,"Oh, but that has, like, nothing to do with the words that are about to come out of my face right now."
01:15:12.341,01:15:14.718,"-Understood. -Yeah, great. Okay. Mm."
01:15:24.311,01:15:25.145,I...
01:15:26.104,01:15:28.065,think I lo...
01:15:28.273,01:15:29.733,Hmm. Why is this so hard?
01:15:30.734,01:15:32.569,Because you've never said it before.
01:15:35.113,01:15:35.948,No.
01:15:37.616,01:15:39.576,"When I was in college, I thought I'd..."
01:15:42.204,01:15:43.038,You get it.
01:15:44.498,01:15:47.626,"With this, uh, one girl, and she was great."
01:15:48.293,01:15:52.381,"You know, everything was great. It was fun. She was smart. Whatever."
01:15:52.756,01:15:56.343,And our relationship was... beautiful.
01:15:57.261,01:15:59.513,"And, out of nowhere, she just like..."
01:16:01.682,01:16:02.683,went back to men.
01:16:04.309,01:16:05.936,And it fucking crushed me.
01:16:07.771,01:16:08.605,I felt like...
01:16:09.565,01:16:11.066,I was just some experiment.
01:16:17.406,01:16:19.908,"-Not Jenny, who's my fucking bestie. -Mm."
01:16:25.747,01:16:27.207,I know what that feels like.
01:16:32.087,01:16:34.798,"See, I've never had someone to share this part of myself with."
01:16:38.135,01:16:45.183,"I'm feeling, like, so many things right now, Yeah. You have two straight best friends."
01:16:46.351,01:16:49.354,I have to imagine you're not sitting around reading queer theory together.
01:16:53.483,01:16:55.235,"You know, I'm good with taking it slow."
01:17:02.159,01:17:05.537,"I am terrified of meeting your friends. Like, what if they don't like me?"
01:17:05.621,01:17:06.747,"Bitch, everybody likes you."
01:17:07.581,01:17:08.415,"Yeah, you right."
01:17:08.498,01:17:11.043,"-Oh, wow. Okay, okay. -You right."
01:17:15.213,01:17:16.715,"-I think I-- -I think I love you, too."
01:17:28.977,01:17:31.521,"I'll find closure on your lips, and then I'll go."
01:17:32.105,01:17:36.401,"Maybe also one more breakfast, one more lunch, and one more dinner."
01:17:37.027,01:17:40.989,"I'll be full and happy, and... we can part."
01:17:42.199,01:17:45.661,"But in between meals, maybe we can lie in bed one more time?"
01:17:46.370,01:18:02.177,"One more prolonged moment where time suspends indefinitely they will equal a lifetime, and I'll never have to get to the part where I let you go."
01:18:04.763,01:18:06.515,Grip on. Grip on tight.
01:18:06.598,01:18:08.558,"-We're okay. Go, go, go, go. -No. Fuck this."
01:18:08.642,01:18:10.352,"Actually, you owe my ass a..."
01:18:11.395,01:18:12.729,"Okay, fine. Let's do it."
01:18:12.979,01:18:14.064,Oh! Shit!
01:18:18.485,01:18:20.237,There are no more one mores.
01:18:21.405,01:18:26.785,"I met you when everything was new and exciting, and the possibilities of the world seemed endless."
01:18:27.452,01:18:28.578,And they still are.
01:18:29.287,01:18:30.997,"For you, for me."
01:18:32.249,01:18:33.125,But not for us.
01:18:34.167,01:18:40.632,"Somewhere between then and now, here and there, I guess we didn't just grow apart, we grew up."
01:18:42.884,01:18:46.763,"When something breaks, if the pieces are large enough, you can fix it."
01:18:47.931,01:18:51.476,"Unfortunately, sometimes things don't break, they shatter."
01:18:52.853,01:18:56.440,"But when you let the light in, shattered glass will glitter."
01:18:57.524,01:19:04.448,"And in those moments, when the pieces of what we were catch the sun, I'll remember just how beautiful it was."
01:19:44.488,01:19:46.740,"-I'll take this room, you take that one. -Yup-yup!"
01:19:48.658,01:19:49.493,Blair!
01:19:55.248,01:19:57.000,"God, you're so fucking sexy."
01:19:58.418,01:19:59.252,"Oh, she cute."
01:19:59.878,01:20:00.712,All right.
01:20:05.759,01:20:08.261,Where the fuck is this bitch?
01:20:20.816,01:20:22.734,"Wow, um... Wow."
01:20:22.818,01:20:23.735,"Uh, Blair Bear?"
01:20:24.778,01:20:35.539,"Girl, I just want you to know that I am just as proud of you right now as I am deeply disturbed And your risqué choices, and I will meet you outside."
01:20:35.622,01:20:37.249,Don't forget to wash your hands.
01:20:39.668,01:20:40.585,"You fuck, boo."
01:20:41.670,01:20:42.504,You fuck.
01:20:50.971,01:20:52.722,Can you please get out of me now?
01:21:02.107,01:21:02.941,Hello.
01:21:03.108,01:21:05.110,"Oh, hey, what's up?"
01:21:05.485,01:21:06.570,-Hi. -Feeling relaxed?
01:21:06.653,01:21:07.487,Shut up.
01:21:07.571,01:21:09.698,Anything you care to share with the class?
01:21:11.491,01:21:12.909,It was only the second time.
01:21:13.368,01:21:14.369,"Oh, my God."
01:21:14.786,01:21:15.620,Today.
01:21:19.666,01:21:21.334,We needed to get the wristbands.
01:21:21.459,01:21:23.545,I don't even fucking know who you are right now.
01:21:24.379,01:21:25.422,"Like, in a bad way?"
01:21:25.881,01:21:27.674,In the best way.
01:21:28.383,01:21:29.217,You out here.
01:21:29.759,01:21:32.929,"Living your best life, just making choices."
01:21:34.306,01:21:35.682,-Yes. -Yes!
01:21:35.765,01:21:36.725,Feels good.
01:21:37.100,01:21:37.934,It should.
01:21:39.477,01:21:41.021,Do you think Jenny's gonna be mad at me?
01:21:41.104,01:21:43.189,No. Why would she be mad at you? She loves you.
01:21:43.398,01:21:44.232,Yeah.
01:21:45.400,01:21:47.360,Did we ever find out where she went?
01:21:47.444,01:21:48.320,No.
01:21:48.987,01:21:49.946,Tiny Ethan...
01:21:50.405,01:21:52.866,"said she said something to Matt about, like..."
01:21:53.408,01:21:56.786,"going out and finishing it, and then she, like, stalked off."
01:22:01.708,01:22:03.126,"Well, it has to do something with Nate."
01:22:03.209,01:22:05.086,Where would she go to finish the relationship?
01:22:07.130,01:22:09.049,"Oh, my God, yep. I know where she's at. Let's go."
01:22:09.883,01:22:10.842,"Oh, God."
01:22:11.176,01:22:12.344,-All right. -God.
01:22:40.789,01:22:41.957,"Man, I fucked up, Jen."
01:22:42.290,01:22:44.209,"Like, I-- I really fucked up."
01:22:45.418,01:22:47.379,"All right, we... have to try."
01:22:48.338,01:22:56.054,"Like, I'll move, or we'll go back and forth or what-- I don't know, but I know that we-- I can't just do this without you."
01:22:56.554,01:22:58.932,"I know I said we gotta be our own people, but..."
