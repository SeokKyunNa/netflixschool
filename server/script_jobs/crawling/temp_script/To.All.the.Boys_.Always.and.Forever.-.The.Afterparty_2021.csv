00:00:13.471,00:00:16.057,I'm definitely the one that breaks the most.
00:00:16.141,00:00:18.435,Stop it. Stop it.
00:00:18.518,00:00:21.438,"David, every time I see you I just think Benchwarmers."
00:00:25.358,00:00:27.902,Anna Cathcart plays matchmaker to London.
00:00:27.986,00:00:31.614,-This is a stressful question. -Stressful! Stress-- I'm living it!
00:00:34.409,00:00:37.912,What was the bingo prize at the retirement home?
00:00:37.996,00:00:39.289,Whoa!
00:00:41.916,00:00:43.376,on The Netflix Afterparty.
00:00:46.629,00:00:47.547,Hey.
00:00:51.217,00:00:52.385,Hey.
00:00:52.469,00:00:54.304,"Oh, it is pretty big out here."
00:00:56.598,00:00:57.807,Look at that.
00:00:59.225,00:01:00.602,Welcome.
00:01:00.685,00:01:02.395,"-Welcome! -Thanks, everybody."
00:01:05.440,00:01:07.942,"-We got a, Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! -Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:01:08.026,00:01:10.153,Everybody welcome to The Netflix Afterparty.
00:01:10.236,00:01:18.453,"With me are my co-hosts Fortune Feimster and London Hughes and the cast of To All the Boys: Always and Forever, Lana, Noah, Janel, Anna!"
00:01:23.708,00:01:26.753,"-Hello, Noah! Hi, Noah! Hi! -All right."
00:01:26.836,00:01:28.463,"What's up, cutie pie?"
00:01:30.548,00:01:32.675,"Warning, this show contains spoilers."
00:01:32.759,00:01:36.930,Only watch this if you've seen all three movies or have a really short-term memory.
00:01:38.640,00:01:44.020,"With three movies in three years, this movie is fast becoming The Fast and the Furious for lonely teenagers."
00:01:44.771,00:01:50.235,"These films prove that not all guys who drive a jeep, play lacrosse, and go to Stanford are douchey."
00:01:50.318,00:01:52.695,"Right? Isn't that… isn't that accurate, Noah?"
00:01:53.279,00:01:54.781,Nice glasses.
00:01:55.865,00:01:59.077,"Once you're rich, get a car, people are gonna hate you anyway."
00:01:59.160,00:02:03.414,"Get a few beans in your jeans, everyone thinks you're a douche no matter what you drive."
00:02:05.083,00:02:08.294,"Yeah, any car, they're like, Look at that asshole. So, whatever."
00:02:09.796,00:02:13.633,"In the new movie, Lara Jean chose between Berkeley and NYU."
00:02:13.716,00:02:19.305,I had to choose between the community college that was two blocks away and the one that was four blocks away.
00:02:19.389,00:02:21.057,"I'm not a genius, folks."
00:02:23.393,00:02:27.313,"All right, Lana and Noah, I'm gonna chat with you guys later, so hang around."
00:02:27.397,00:02:31.943,First I'm gonna talk to the girls responsible for setting your characters up. Take a look.
00:02:33.278,00:02:35.697,I'm really sorry that Peter didn't come tonight.
00:02:37.240,00:02:38.241,It's okay.
00:02:39.200,00:02:40.368,We are broken up.
00:02:44.247,00:02:46.040,-I love you. -I love you too.
00:02:46.124,00:02:47.167,Go to bed soon.
00:02:47.625,00:02:48.668,I will.
00:02:49.586,00:02:50.420,You too.
00:02:50.503,00:02:51.921,-Good night. -Good night.
00:02:59.429,00:03:01.764,I think you might've left something in the tent.
00:03:01.848,00:03:03.266,You should go get that.
00:03:03.808,00:03:05.393,-Whatever. -No.
00:03:07.604,00:03:09.063,You should get it tonight.
00:03:15.904,00:03:17.238,"Good night, Lara Jean."
00:03:19.991,00:03:23.786,"All right. Please say hello, again, to Janel Parrish and Anna Cathcart."
00:03:26.205,00:03:28.374,-Whoo. -Hi!
00:03:32.253,00:03:34.005,"Anna, you're the youngest."
00:03:34.088,00:03:36.132,Were you spoiled on the set?
00:03:36.215,00:03:38.885,Did you throw tantrums? Did you know your lines?
00:03:39.510,00:03:43.014,"Um, yeah, the baby of the group. No, it was the best."
00:03:43.097,00:03:51.439,"I was just like the little sister for everyone and made a bunch of older siblings, which was honestly the dream, so it was the best, it was so fun."
00:03:52.273,00:03:55.235,"You, uh… I'm sort of the mom of our group."
00:03:55.318,00:04:04.494,"Yeah, it's true. And I'm sort of like the drunk, alcoholic auntie of our group, I guess I'm… the model?"
00:04:07.163,00:04:09.874,-Every group has a model? -Every one.
00:04:09.958,00:04:10.833,Yeah.
00:04:11.459,00:04:13.711,I heard you're the mom of the group out there.
00:04:13.795,00:04:14.796,"So, what did you do?"
00:04:14.879,00:04:17.548,Put a location finder on everyone's phone?
00:04:17.632,00:04:23.972,"Yeah, okay, I don't know. I got that title of, like, kind of-- Honestly, like, the older sibling, not even the mom."
00:04:24.055,00:04:26.599,I don't think I'm responsible enough for that title.
00:04:26.683,00:04:30.228,"I was kinda giving people pep talks, trying to keep the gang together."
00:04:30.311,00:04:34.148,"As other people say, I have not given myself this title, but… apparently."
00:04:35.358,00:04:41.531,Are you aware that the guy playing your father once was famous on another hit show?
00:04:42.282,00:04:45.952,Me! Me! Me! I love him so much on Sex and the City.
00:04:46.035,00:04:48.371,"I mean, that was my favorite show of all time."
00:04:48.454,00:04:50.957,I can't believe that Aidan was my dad.
00:04:52.917,00:04:55.795,I can't believe Carrie dumped Aidan for Mr. Big.
00:04:55.878,00:04:58.464,He made furniture. That's like a lesbian's dream.
00:04:58.548,00:05:02.802,"First of all, Fortune, don't pretend that you've ever watched Sex and the City."
00:05:03.803,00:05:06.806,Uh… I'm a Samantha.
00:05:08.474,00:05:10.935,I feel like I'm the Samantha of this show.
00:05:16.149,00:05:20.820,Whatever that means. Um… I heard John Corbett did a lot of improv.
00:05:20.903,00:05:22.196,Did that rub off on you?
00:05:22.280,00:05:25.908,Were there times when any of you went off script or were you allowed to?
00:05:25.992,00:05:28.286,"Yeah. Honestly, that's my favorite thing to do."
00:05:28.369,00:05:30.580,You don't always get the chance on every set.
00:05:30.663,00:05:32.915,There was a lot of improv in a lot of scenes.
00:05:32.999,00:05:43.176,"But, yeah, John would often do something that no one was expecting or, like, he would rely on us to just go with it and be like, Okay, we're doing this now. Okay, let's do this."
00:05:43.259,00:05:45.636,"So, as always, keeping us on our toes."
00:05:45.720,00:05:47.805,It was fun though. I love doing improv.
00:05:47.889,00:05:50.349,"Yeah, Janel, the improv fucking wakes you up."
00:05:50.433,00:05:56.230,"When you're on a set and the other guy doesn't do their lines, they make up stuff, you go, Oh, here we go."
00:05:57.607,00:05:58.858,"Janel, you liked it?"
00:05:58.941,00:06:01.360,"I loved it, oh my gosh. He's such a goofball."
00:06:01.444,00:06:12.371,"Some of my favorite times on set are the times where we're just playing and having giggle fits and the cute, little moments when they make it into the movie I feel like they make it more organic."
00:06:12.455,00:06:15.208,The last movie you got to film in Korea.
00:06:15.958,00:06:17.960,Truly the best thing ever.
00:06:18.044,00:06:26.177,"I mean, we got to hang out in Korea, wrap the movie in Korea, and eat all the food, and that was our job."
00:06:28.429,00:06:31.474,"There's a nice Cheesecake Factory over there, I think."
00:06:32.517,00:06:34.393,Maybe I'm thinking of somewhere else.
00:06:34.477,00:06:38.397,"Janel, what's different about this movie than the first two?"
00:06:38.481,00:06:41.859,"Well, this is a beautiful ending to Lara Jean's story."
00:06:41.943,00:06:48.116,"Um, and you get some amazing big life-moments in this film."
00:06:48.825,00:06:55.081,And you watch how Lara Jean's become a really independent young woman off to the next chapter of her life.
00:06:55.164,00:06:57.542,Little bit of a sneaky tearjerker at times.
00:06:57.625,00:06:59.043,A hundred percent.
00:06:59.127,00:07:11.889,"There are so many moments, especially the last scene, especially for us cast members who've done three movies, that last scene where you see Lara Jean heading off into the next stage of her life, just tears."
00:07:11.973,00:07:15.601,"Sorry, I'm just imagining David Spade crying over a teen rom-com."
00:07:18.146,00:07:19.480,We love to see it.
00:07:19.564,00:07:22.942,-I had to hold him the whole movie. -I crawled into Fortune's arms.
00:07:25.236,00:07:29.157,"And said, Don't tell me how it ends. I… I know what's happening."
00:07:29.240,00:07:31.951,"-Brushing his hair, it was a whole thing. -A whole thing."
00:07:32.034,00:07:35.163,Thanks so much! Stick around. We've got more to talk about.
00:07:35.246,00:07:37.540,-Thank you. -Thank you.
00:07:39.750,00:07:42.420,"Listen, Lara Jean can't date boys forever."
00:07:42.503,00:07:45.882,Here to give advice on dating men is Whitney Cummings.
00:07:47.383,00:07:48.926,"Thanks, Adam Sandler's friend."
00:07:49.010,00:07:59.520,"You know, if you're watching To All the Boys, that probably means you have completely unrealistic expectations for how relationships are supposed to be."
00:07:59.604,00:08:03.316,But you know who doesn't have unrealistic expectations? Me.
00:08:03.399,00:08:07.528,I'm gonna give you guys the advice that I wish I had gotten when I was your age.
00:08:07.612,00:08:13.993,"If you make out in a hot tub, which I do not recommend, not particularly hygienic, you must get on a good probiotic."
00:08:15.036,00:08:16.829,You will get a UTI like that.
00:08:16.913,00:08:18.372,Be careful dating nerds.
00:08:18.456,00:08:27.590,"Yeah, some of them grow up to be Elon Musk but most of them grow up to work in tech support and have a shelf full of Warcraft figurines."
00:08:27.673,00:08:31.636,They won't pay for dinner because their money's tied up in Bitcoin.
00:08:31.719,00:08:36.265,"Pro tip: if you're gonna date a man at a nursing home, don't date the volunteer."
00:08:36.349,00:08:45.858,"Be an entrepreneur, date that rich guy who's upstairs, wandering around, who can't seem to remember his kids names or hasn't found the time to sign that will."
00:08:45.942,00:08:48.361,It's called being a business person.
00:08:48.444,00:08:51.989,Do not go to college with your boyfriend.
00:08:52.073,00:08:54.992,It defeats the whole purpose of what college is all about.
00:08:55.076,00:08:58.704,It's like going to the Hometown Buffet with a lap band.
00:08:59.830,00:09:00.915,Pick a lane.
00:09:00.998,00:09:05.503,"Do not, under any circumstances, have sex on the first date."
00:09:06.212,00:09:09.674,Kidding. Auntie Whitney would never give that advice. It's ridiculous.
00:09:09.757,00:09:12.468,You gotta know what's under the hood as soon as possible.
00:09:12.552,00:09:16.222,"As long as it's consensual, and as long as he deletes the video."
00:09:16.305,00:09:22.436,And then delete the deleted video. Make sure he-- You have to go into the trash folder and make sure that's deleted.
00:09:22.520,00:09:25.189,Then make sure it's just not backed up to the cloud.
00:09:25.273,00:09:26.983,"So, nothing goes to the cloud."
00:09:27.066,00:09:29.819,"When you send nudes, you gotta crop your head out."
00:09:29.902,00:09:34.240,I know it's hard to believe but he's not… he's not looking at your face.
00:09:34.323,00:09:37.076,"Wear sunscreen, don't take too much Adderall."
00:09:37.159,00:09:40.371,"It is not a permanent solution to your problem, I'm telling you."
00:09:40.454,00:09:43.583,"Don't date magicians, don't date musicians."
00:09:44.166,00:09:46.836,"When he says he's allergic to latex, that's not real."
00:09:46.919,00:09:48.588,"That's not true, not a real thing."
00:09:48.671,00:09:53.718,"Oh, and if he's not on social media that doesn't mean he's, like, cool and mysterious."
00:09:53.801,00:09:55.303,He's just… he's married.
00:10:00.558,00:10:03.227,"Whitney! Thank you, Whitney."
00:10:03.311,00:10:06.981,"By the way, you can check out her special, which is great, Can I Touch It?"
00:10:07.064,00:10:08.899,"Streaming now, click on it."
00:10:09.650,00:10:13.446,"While Whitney is ending relationships, London is looking to start one."
00:10:13.529,00:10:18.326,"She's enlisted the help of Anna Cathcart, so here we are, Off to London."
00:10:22.788,00:10:30.880,"Okay, since I'm the only single one on this show, I've decided to sit down with Anna who plays the master matchmaker in To All the Boys."
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.424,"Hi, Anna babes, hey, good to see you."
00:10:33.507,00:10:34.550,Hi.
00:10:34.634,00:10:40.598,"So, I moved to LA last year, I lived my best life."
00:10:40.681,00:10:44.810,But then there was a nationwide pandemic which wasn't my fault.
00:10:44.894,00:10:49.315,The only thing I managed to fall in love with is my houseplant Geoffrey. Right?
00:10:50.066,00:10:53.611,"He's a great guy. He's the tall, silent type, he loves direct sunlight."
00:10:53.694,00:10:54.779,He's lovely.
00:10:54.862,00:10:59.033,"The thing is, I've been relying on myself to find a man, and that's not working."
00:11:01.744,00:11:05.998,"And you could use the matchmaking skills you use in the movies on me, okay?"
00:11:06.082,00:11:07.625,-I'm so ready -Let's do it.
00:11:07.708,00:11:11.837,First question: Which person should take me out?
00:11:11.921,00:11:15.508,"A. John Ambrose, absolute hottie."
00:11:15.591,00:11:21.055,"B. Peter's friend, Trevor, C. LJ's friend, Christine. A female."
00:11:21.138,00:11:27.228,I can swing both ways. I can swing… I'm fluid. I'm fluid.
00:11:27.311,00:11:32.733,"Or D… your dad, Dr. Covey, AKA Aidan from Sex and the City."
00:11:32.817,00:11:35.611,"Who should it be, A, B, C, or D?"
00:11:36.362,00:11:41.450,-This is a stressful question. -Stressful. Stress-- I'm living it! I'm living it! It's stressful.
00:11:41.534,00:11:46.956,"I know, I can't even imagine. Um… -You know, I feel like… -Think about it."
00:11:47.039,00:11:51.585,"…thinking date-wise, I feel like Chris would take you on a pretty rad date."
00:11:51.669,00:11:52.586,Okay.
00:11:52.670,00:11:57.508,"But I also think John Ambrose, to me, is, like, the most charming ever."
00:12:01.053,00:12:02.972,"You're going with A, John Ambrose."
00:12:03.055,00:12:07.560,I can reveal that the actual answer is Noah Centineo!
00:12:10.020,00:12:12.898,"The answer is Noah, none of the above."
00:12:13.649,00:12:15.109,Noah Centineo.
00:12:15.192,00:12:17.862,I am Noah's ark. I want him to board me.
00:12:17.945,00:12:23.367,"Okay? That's what… I feel like… No, I had to say it. I had to say it."
00:12:23.451,00:12:27.163,I was set up for a trick question. That was so unfair.
00:12:27.246,00:12:30.166,Think outside the box. You've got this. It's fine.
00:12:30.249,00:12:32.793,You lost the first one. There's other questions.
00:12:32.877,00:12:37.131,"You could gain my respect. Okay, so, second question."
00:12:37.214,00:12:42.136,Every great romance needs to start with the perfect meet cute.
00:12:42.219,00:12:43.679,What's my meet cute?
00:12:43.762,00:12:48.642,"A. He's the boy next door, I'm the black girl next door. Right?"
00:12:48.726,00:12:51.437,"What could be more racially-wholesome, right?"
00:12:52.313,00:13:05.618,"B. I'm at a bowling alley, I'm bowling with friends, and when I sling the ball backwards, it flies from my hand and hits my future boyfriend in the head, concussion love, okay?"
00:13:05.701,00:13:07.286,"Oh, my God, okay."
00:13:07.369,00:13:20.758,"Or C-- Good one, innit? Concussion love. Or C… when the Starbucks barista calls out Lord Voldemort we both go to get it and realize we pulled the same Harry Potter-based name prank 'cause we're cool."
00:13:22.218,00:13:23.802,"A, B or C?"
00:13:24.803,00:13:27.223,I like C a lot. So we're gonna go with that.
00:13:27.306,00:13:28.849,We're gonna go with C?
00:13:28.933,00:13:33.187,"Okay, um, that is… incorrect!"
00:13:33.270,00:13:44.240,"I can give you the answer. The answer is, um, I bump into Noah Centineo… with a box of blueberries and I ruin his perfectly white Noah Centineo shirt."
00:13:44.323,00:13:50.746,"So Noah Centineo takes the shirt off and I see his abs, and that is-- You messed it up, you got it wrong."
00:13:51.455,00:13:53.541,You might get it in the third one.
00:13:53.624,00:13:55.668,"-Okay, final question. -Okay."
00:13:55.751,00:13:57.920,What's our first date?
00:13:58.546,00:14:03.509,"A. Cardona's Italian restaurant, little bit of pizza, little bit of love, right?"
00:14:03.592,00:14:07.388,"B. House party at the rich kid's place, right?"
00:14:07.471,00:14:10.516,"Or C, the hot tub. Think about it."
00:14:11.141,00:14:14.395,"No, I can't swim and this don't swim, but think about it."
00:14:14.478,00:14:16.397,You can't get this wet.
00:14:16.480,00:14:18.065,"A, B, or C?"
00:14:18.148,00:14:21.443,"Okay, I have been tricked a few times here."
00:14:21.527,00:14:22.736,"-So… -Yes, you have."
00:14:22.820,00:14:26.115,…can I say Noah Centineo's house?
00:14:26.198,00:14:28.325,Ooh!
00:14:29.368,00:14:30.703,Oi!
00:14:32.162,00:14:38.752,"Okay, the actual answer was making out in the back of Noah's Centineo's car in the parking garage behind here."
00:14:38.836,00:14:40.880,-But I like your answer. -I was so close!
00:14:40.963,00:14:42.298,I like your answer better.
00:14:42.381,00:14:46.135,I get to see where he lives and how he's living. Know what I mean?
00:14:46.218,00:14:48.053,"Thank you, hon. Take care."
00:14:48.137,00:14:50.097,This was so fun. Thank you.
00:14:53.517,00:14:58.981,"In the movies, Lara Jean writes five secret love letters to all the boys she's loved."
00:14:59.607,00:15:02.651,But there's no denying who her heart truly belongs to.
00:15:02.735,00:15:03.652,Take a look.
00:15:03.736,00:15:09.825,"The best part is we both got in, so we're going together."
00:15:10.534,00:15:38.103,"-I'll be right back. I promise. -Peter-- Lara Jean Song Covey, will you go to prom with me?"
00:15:43.692,00:15:48.072,She said yes. Please say hello to Lana Condor and Noah Centineo.
00:15:50.491,00:15:51.867,Yeah.
00:15:53.827,00:15:54.703,Yeah.
00:15:59.375,00:16:05.214,You've been with your boyfriend Anthony for five years. Uh… Did you ever write him a love letter?
00:16:05.297,00:16:07.925,"-Ooh, good question. -Good question."
00:16:08.008,00:16:15.599,"You know, I feel like when it comes to the romance part of our relationship, he's much better than I am."
00:16:15.683,00:16:20.938,"So he writes me letters and I just receive them, and… you know."
00:16:24.066,00:16:26.360,"He writes you, like, songs and stuff."
00:16:26.443,00:16:28.278,"Yes, he does."
00:16:28.904,00:16:34.451,"You know, I often feel like maybe I should step it up a little, especially because of the movies."
00:16:34.535,00:16:40.124,"Um, I feel like people think I'm some sort of romance cupid or whatnot."
00:16:40.207,00:16:44.586,"But I… I-- Lara Jean is much more romantic than I am, I will say."
00:16:44.670,00:16:45.629,Aw.
00:16:45.713,00:16:47.756,I have some business to settle with Noah.
00:16:48.298,00:16:49.299,Okay.
00:16:49.383,00:16:56.306,"We were up for a People's Choice Award, and, uh, I think you smoked me, but-- I won, I think."
00:16:56.390,00:17:00.769,"-Was that what it was? -I did, um… I took it well, I trashed my dressing room."
00:17:01.562,00:17:03.564,And I'm dealing with it in therapy.
00:17:04.148,00:17:06.734,-Do you remember this? -I think it turns you on.
00:17:07.818,00:17:14.116,"I'm thinking to myself, why hasn't this man reached out and taken me to dinner yet? That's what I was trying to figure out."
00:17:14.199,00:17:15.492,"No, he-- No."
00:17:16.118,00:17:19.121,"This is a funny story, Noah."
00:17:19.788,00:17:28.505,"They-- What happened was, innocently, when Noah was on, they cut to me in the audience and I was licking my lips, I don't know why."
00:17:28.589,00:17:35.637,And it looked like I was doing it watching… -I don't know what happened. I don't know. -What?
00:17:35.721,00:17:38.891,"-This isn't about that, London. -He looked at me like this."
00:17:43.187,00:17:46.482,-I didn't know this! -I was thinking of something else.
00:17:49.068,00:17:52.029,No. Listen. My mom voted for him. I understand how it works.
00:17:53.280,00:18:05.459,"I… By the way, the year before, Noah, if this isn't bad enough, the year before, I was presenting. So we were at the Peep's Choice and Aubrey Plaza, who I love, we were doing a presentation."
00:18:05.542,00:18:08.545,So we're going over our stupid bit and we're about to go on.
00:18:08.629,00:18:11.215,"They're like, Five seconds, and Noah's onstage."
00:18:11.298,00:18:15.594,"And it is so loud, it's so much screaming, it's like Dodger Stadium popped a leak."
00:18:15.677,00:18:18.639,"I'm like, What is going on? He just won something."
00:18:18.722,00:18:21.266,And they're going so shithouse.
00:18:21.350,00:18:25.437,"I was like, Oh. And so then… Remember this, Noah? You sat down."
00:18:25.521,00:18:28.524,You started to leave -then you sat down on the stage. -I do.
00:18:28.607,00:18:30.526,"We stop and she goes, What's he doing?"
00:18:30.609,00:18:41.286,"I go, Milking it. Because he's getting more… And so then he finally leaves and we start to go out and they're like, Boo! Where's he going?"
00:18:41.370,00:18:42.788,"I'm like, No, it's us now."
00:18:42.871,00:18:45.457,"Hi, I'm David Spade. This kid's like, Fuck you!"
00:18:45.541,00:18:48.418,"I'm like, Hey, you're 12. Why are you mad at me?"
00:18:48.502,00:18:55.217,"They're like, He's still in the building. Show some respect! I'm like… So we all have to wait for everyone to calm down."
00:18:55.300,00:18:58.011,"And they're like, All right, do your stupid thing."
00:18:58.095,00:19:04.518,"Anyway, it was fun. Um… David, imagine… Okay, so I'm listening to your story."
00:19:04.601,00:19:11.608,"Now imagine I'm the one -that has to keep giving Noah the awards. -Oh, yeah, that's horrible."
00:19:11.692,00:19:15.320,"Over and over and over again, with the screaming."
00:19:15.404,00:19:16.613,Ugh.
00:19:16.697,00:19:22.452,"I know, listen… I can't believe they're so immature, screaming over him. I mean, ha!"
00:19:22.536,00:19:31.795,She was screaming over you five minutes-- I'm trying to remember if you were wearing me or your underwear Noah!
00:19:32.754,00:19:36.592,"Don't you dare! I will jump through that Zoom call, don't you dare."
00:19:36.675,00:19:42.139,"Truth be told, you guys lost me with this movie when it started with To All the Boys."
00:19:42.890,00:19:45.475,There you go. There you go.
00:19:45.559,00:19:50.314,"This is the third movie. I'm telling you this, it's the third movie."
00:19:50.397,00:19:52.774,-And when you read the script-- -What?
00:19:53.650,00:19:57.362,"Noah just figured it out. Wait, this is the third one?"
00:19:57.446,00:19:58.780,Out of how many?
00:19:58.864,00:20:01.325,"Lana, what were your thoughts when you read it?"
00:20:01.408,00:20:03.577,You like where it was going? Where it ended?
00:20:03.660,00:20:12.127,"Yeah, I mean, I think my favorite part of the third movie is that, you know, in the first and second movies it's all about choosing relationships."
00:20:12.211,00:20:36.360,"Choosing… the majority of the conflict is choosing between guys, which is a fun experience to have and it's accurate to the rom-com, but my most important thing was that in the third movie it would be about Lara Jean choosing herself and choosing her future and where she wanted to end up, regardless of whether or not it was gonna affect the relationships around her."
00:20:36.443,00:20:45.452,"So I'm actually… I was very, very happy to see her kind of come full circle and now she's stepping out into the world as this young woman."
00:20:46.411,00:20:55.254,"And choosing herself over choosing all the boys, which is exciting and super fun but, you know, realistically, she does have to go out and start her life."
00:20:55.337,00:20:57.422,"Good riddance, Peter Kavinsky."
00:20:59.466,00:21:02.719,"I stopped choosing boys, I think, at 13."
00:21:05.055,00:21:06.473,I get it. I get it.
00:21:07.724,00:21:09.935,"Oh, Noah's over there putting on ChapStick."
00:21:10.018,00:21:12.354,I know. I couldn't concentrate.
00:21:12.437,00:21:14.731,And that did something for me.
00:21:20.279,00:21:23.240,"David, every time I see you, I just think Benchwarmers."
00:21:23.323,00:21:36.336,"Yeah, I know. Benchwarmers-- Benchwarmers, it was about female empowerment."
00:21:36.420,00:21:39.172,I dated Salad Girl. She worked at Pizza Hut.
00:21:39.256,00:21:40.674,And I won't give it all away.
00:21:43.302,00:21:45.929,"If you want a nice hairstyle, check it out."
00:21:46.847,00:21:48.849,I was on the cover of Bowl Cut magazine.
00:21:51.935,00:21:53.729,"Anyway, back to you, guys."
00:21:55.522,00:22:06.742,"In the movie, they steal a couch and put it on a subway, and I thought, just from being in the movies myself, I thought, is that made of feathers or marshmallows?"
00:22:06.825,00:22:10.704,Because there's no way you're carrying that couch take after take after take.
00:22:10.787,00:22:11.788,Was it heavy?
00:22:11.872,00:22:15.876,"Um, no. I mean, there's a bunch of girls carrying it so it was helpful."
00:22:15.959,00:22:18.962,But inside of the couch is all gone.
00:22:19.046,00:22:21.173,So it's just basically the frame.
00:22:21.256,00:22:29.681,"But it was more just maneuvering it into the subway, which is always a little bit clunky, and I think that's why we wanted it to look really clunky."
00:22:29.765,00:22:34.936,Because I think New Yorkers are so much more gritty and stronger than people from LA.
00:22:35.020,00:22:39.483,"They're like, Yes, I will move all of my house and furniture in the subway."
00:22:39.566,00:22:43.111,"And I think people in LA are like, We're just gonna call movers."
00:22:43.195,00:22:49.326,"So we wanted to show, like, the making it work, which I think is the whole New York vibe."
00:22:50.577,00:22:59.252,"The roles I usually book are the ones that are like, You're gonna be the one that carries the couch… Oh. For the pretty girl."
00:22:59.336,00:23:00.962,We have a little surprise.
00:23:01.046,00:23:04.424,We reached out to the fans and there were a couple trillion.
00:23:05.467,00:23:08.512,We found a fan that has been with you since the first movie.
00:23:08.595,00:23:11.473,We'll let her ask you questions. Please welcome Ella.
00:23:13.183,00:23:14.559,Yeah.
00:23:14.643,00:23:16.770,-Hi. -Hi. What's up?
00:23:16.853,00:23:18.605,Hi. How are you guys?
00:23:18.688,00:23:21.441,-I'm great. -Good. Very good. How are you?
00:23:23.068,00:23:25.445,I'm so happy to be here with you both.
00:23:25.529,00:23:32.285,"My first question, if we could get a peak of the blooper reel, what would it look like, and who had the most bloopers?"
00:23:32.369,00:23:37.332,"I mean, I'm definitely the one that breaks the most during scenes."
00:23:37.415,00:23:38.834,There would be some of that.
00:23:38.917,00:23:42.295,"There would be some of Lana being like, Don't! Stop it. Stop it."
00:23:42.379,00:23:46.299,There would be a good amount of you saying that to people off camera.
00:23:46.383,00:23:48.885,Stop it. Stop it.
00:23:48.969,00:23:53.598,"Lana, I remember during the second movie I tried to create a blooper reel."
00:23:53.682,00:24:05.235,"I remember, every time they would say, Rolling, and the camera would record, I would start doing really weird things to camera like until right before they'd say, Action, and then I'd just go into it."
00:24:05.318,00:24:07.404,-Yes. -And there was no blooper reel.
00:24:07.487,00:24:10.490,-They didn't even give us one. -They weren't bloopy enough.
00:24:10.574,00:24:13.660,"So, on the third, I was like, Fuck this, I'm not doing it."
00:24:15.662,00:24:19.416,"Noah's like, I just made funny faces. I don't know why that wasn't enough."
00:24:20.667,00:24:22.586,I want blooper reels. I like it.
00:24:22.669,00:24:24.629,"Ella, you got any more questions?"
00:24:24.713,00:24:27.299,"So, Always and Forever, it's the end of the trilogy."
00:24:27.382,00:24:29.926,What are you gonna miss most from your time on set?
00:24:30.010,00:24:35.640,"I think I'm just gonna miss, um, seeing all my friends and production."
00:24:36.558,00:24:43.356,"You know, once you spend, like, three years together, you get really tight, and I got used to just seeing them every day."
00:24:43.440,00:24:53.700,"I got used to seeing Noah every single day, so that's something I think I'll miss the most, just my friends and I loved, you know, the director and I loved, you know, everyone, the crew."
00:24:53.783,00:24:55.827,"So, I'll just miss seeing my friends."
00:24:55.911,00:25:07.297,"I agree. I think it's just the whole experience of living in Vancouver, and having your friends with you up there and doing something called work, when really you just get to express and be weird."
00:25:08.048,00:25:09.758,"-Aw. -Anyway, thank you, Ella."
00:25:09.841,00:25:11.134,Thank you.
00:25:11.718,00:25:13.261,Thank you to Noah and Lana.
00:25:13.345,00:25:17.140,"We're gonna play a game with the entire cast in a second, so stick around."
00:25:20.018,00:25:23.230,A lot of people think Noah and Lana were perfect for their roles.
00:25:23.313,00:25:25.899,But it was actually a super tough audition process.
00:25:26.483,00:25:30.487,Some people are saying this version of the movie might've been better.
00:25:35.742,00:25:39.120,"London Hughes, here for the role of Lara Jean."
00:25:41.206,00:25:43.792,"I know, but I've always wanted to be a cheerleader."
00:25:43.875,00:25:46.753,"We don't have 'em in Britain, so I'm gonna try it out."
00:25:47.337,00:25:49.673,Ready? Score the basketball!
00:25:49.756,00:25:54.594,Fortune Feimster. I'm here to read the role of sassy lunch lady.
00:25:57.555,00:25:58.431,I know.
00:25:58.515,00:26:01.393,And you're in luck because I actually wrote myself a part.
00:26:01.476,00:26:06.231,"Hey, David Spade, auditioning for… well, you know."
00:26:06.314,00:26:08.608,Are you auditioning to be the geometry teacher?
00:26:08.692,00:26:10.777,"No, that's funny. I was good in geometry."
00:26:10.860,00:26:14.364,"No, I'm playing, uh, Peter, senior hunk."
00:26:14.447,00:26:15.991,I mostly go for hunk parts.
00:26:17.617,00:26:21.329,I don't wanna be with a boy whose heart belongs to someone else.
00:26:23.498,00:26:26.251,I don't understand her motivation. What is she thinking?
00:26:26.334,00:26:28.378,'Cause this guy is fine. He's fine.
00:26:28.461,00:26:37.679,"And if he wants to play hide the sausage, we're playing hide the sausage. So… Okay, this is gonna be my most difficult acting role yet."
00:26:37.762,00:26:41.057,'Cause I haven't prepared for that. I'm usually method.
00:26:41.141,00:26:45.687,"Lara Jean, do you know what true love and chili have in common?"
00:26:45.770,00:26:48.982,They will cut right through you like a knife!
00:26:49.065,00:26:51.276,"Okay, you need to get out there, girl."
00:26:51.359,00:26:55.113,Stop putting all your eggs in one basket. You're young!
00:26:55.196,00:26:57.073,Go out with Peter!
00:26:57.157,00:26:59.409,Kiss John Ambrose.
00:26:59.492,00:27:02.120,"Make out with Christine, she's hot!"
00:27:02.203,00:27:04.247,That's what the fans want!
00:27:04.331,00:27:05.749,That's what the fans want?
00:27:05.832,00:27:09.461,"Oh, sorry, I got lost in, um… I got lost in the moment."
00:27:09.544,00:27:10.545,Ah… whoo.
00:27:14.549,00:27:17.719,You might wanna look for a new set of eyes. I check all boxes.
00:27:17.802,00:27:19.054,"I'm the athlete, right?"
00:27:19.137,00:27:21.931,So I could be the football quarterback.
00:27:22.015,00:27:23.058,I'd be like this.
00:27:23.141,00:27:24.934,Set huh. Set huh.
00:27:25.018,00:27:26.644,Omaha. Omaha. Omaha. Omaha.
00:27:26.728,00:27:29.272,"And then I go, pew. Whatever they do in football."
00:27:29.356,00:27:30.982,I could cover anything.
00:27:31.066,00:27:33.276,Baseball. Gun club.
00:27:33.360,00:27:34.319,Broom guy.
00:27:35.111,00:27:37.447,Hustler. Rack 'em!
00:27:37.530,00:27:39.866,Pole vaulter. Bey-oop!
00:27:39.949,00:27:41.076,Pole climber.
00:27:42.202,00:27:43.536,Bing!
00:27:43.620,00:27:44.579,Bunt.
00:27:46.498,00:27:50.126,"Wingardium Leviosa! Take that, you Boggart!"
00:27:52.379,00:27:55.382,"It would be cool if we added some magic, make it more modern."
00:27:55.465,00:27:57.550,"They made that movie, it's Harry Potter."
00:27:57.634,00:28:01.805,But there's no black people in that. I'm trying to add myself into this one.
00:28:01.888,00:28:03.390,"Be the sexy, black witch."
00:28:03.473,00:28:05.642,"Zap! Bang, Noah!"
00:28:08.937,00:28:12.232,"Hey, who took my juice, man? I'm a goalie without my juice."
00:28:13.775,00:28:15.735,"I'm Peter, remember? I'm an athlete."
00:28:18.738,00:28:20.782,"Oh, okay, so he's not a real athlete."
00:28:20.865,00:28:23.952,I was worried I had to get in shape if I got this.
00:28:24.035,00:28:26.079,I'll just fire my Pilates teacher.
00:28:26.162,00:28:29.749,"I'm sorry, there's just no room in this movie for a lunch lady."
00:28:29.833,00:28:32.544,I just wanna be in this movie.
00:28:33.503,00:28:37.715,"I love this movie, all of 'em."
00:28:41.094,00:28:42.929,"-Okay, I'll be out there. -Great."
00:28:43.012,00:28:45.056,-And do they do callbacks here? -No.
00:28:45.140,00:28:48.518,"Okay. If you have a callback, just call me and I'll come back."
00:28:48.601,00:28:50.186,Is that where they got that?
00:28:52.522,00:28:54.190,Ah! Spader!
00:28:56.526,00:29:00.321,"All right, to all the fans at home the movies are unforgettable."
00:29:00.405,00:29:02.657,But are they unforgettable to the cast?
00:29:02.741,00:29:04.033,Whoa!
00:29:04.117,00:29:06.953,Fortune's gonna find out in a game we call Ring a Bell.
00:29:14.919,00:29:18.173,To All the Boys premiered in 2018.
00:29:18.256,00:29:20.925,That's a decade ago in Hollywood years.
00:29:22.343,00:29:28.892,"Today, we'll be asking the cast a question to see how well they remember their own movies."
00:29:28.975,00:29:33.188,This should be fun. I can't even remember if I put on underwear this morning.
00:29:34.731,00:29:36.649,Surprise! I did.
00:29:37.650,00:29:39.110,"-Well done, Fortune. -Aw."
00:29:39.861,00:29:44.783,"Okay, Janel, the first question is for you. Are you ready?"
00:29:44.866,00:29:46.868,I think so. I'm nervous.
00:29:47.744,00:29:56.753,"Whoo. Okay, Janel, in the original, Margot got a stack of magazines from her dad, right before she got on the plane to go to Scotland."
00:29:56.836,00:30:02.884,What was the name of the magazine he specifically mentioned?
00:30:06.429,00:30:07.847,You guys know? Don't say.
00:30:11.935,00:30:16.064,"That, first of all, wow, real hard."
00:30:16.147,00:30:19.234,"Listen, I watched all three movies, I did a lot of diggin'."
00:30:21.319,00:30:22.570,Pottery Barn?
00:30:24.447,00:30:26.074,Did you say Pottery Barn?
00:30:27.367,00:30:34.499,"Seemed like something Margot would like, I mean… Was it something about, like, automobiles?"
00:30:36.459,00:30:37.919,"-Oh. -Oh, here comes Anna."
00:30:38.002,00:30:46.845,"I think, like, tractor, something about a tractor. Track and… -Track and Road. -Track and Road."
00:30:46.928,00:30:48.763,"-Something-- -Janel, what'd you say?"
00:30:49.681,00:30:51.015,Was it Track and Field?
00:30:51.099,00:30:53.476,"Well, let's find out with this clip."
00:30:53.560,00:30:56.729,We couldn't decide so we got you all of them.
00:30:56.813,00:30:58.273,That's Road &amp; Track.
00:31:07.031,00:31:15.039,"Road and track, those are two things I hate running on, so… Anna, you're up. Let's see how good you are at this one!"
00:31:15.123,00:31:25.258,"In the last movie, LJ, Margot, and Kitty went to the lock bridge in Korea with their dad and found the lock their mom left there, which would never happen."
00:31:29.053,00:31:40.148,"Look, this is from 20 years ago. Anyway… Anna, what was written on the lock?"
00:31:43.192,00:31:44.944,For the rest of my life.
00:31:45.028,00:31:46.988,"All right, let's check out the video."
00:31:52.243,00:31:56.497,"It's Eve and Dan, and then on the back, For the rest of my life."
00:31:56.581,00:32:04.964,"-Boo. -So… There's the bell, okay."
00:32:05.048,00:32:09.135,"-All right, Noah, this one's for you. -Uh-huh. Okay."
00:32:09.218,00:32:16.184,"In the first movie, Peter surprised LJ at her house and invited her to a party."
00:32:16.267,00:32:23.566,"When he asked Dr. Covey for permission, what were the three things he told Peter he couldn't do?"
00:32:23.650,00:32:30.865,"Uh… I'm gonna go with no touching, no drugs, and no alcohol."
00:32:30.949,00:32:34.869,-Janel and Anna added no drinking. -Drinking.
00:32:34.953,00:32:37.413,"-All right. -No drinking. Okay, no alcohol."
00:32:37.497,00:32:39.999,Let's see what the answer is.
00:32:40.083,00:32:44.170,"-No drinking, no drugs, no hands. -You got it."
00:32:44.253,00:32:45.797,-No hands. -No hands.
00:32:45.880,00:32:48.716,-Well done! -That was close. That was close.
00:32:50.301,00:32:51.427,You gave him that one?
00:32:54.138,00:32:55.556,"All right, Lana."
00:33:02.397,00:33:08.820,"Okay, in movie number two, what was the bingo prize at the retirement home?"
00:33:10.029,00:33:11.698,A wheel of gouda.
00:33:12.573,00:33:14.033,"Well, let's check it out."
00:33:14.117,00:33:15.493,"It was, she's right."
00:33:20.832,00:33:24.127,-That was the fastest answer. -You snapped it.
00:33:24.210,00:33:27.588,You are very gouda at that game.
00:33:29.424,00:33:31.843,"Greg, what's the prize? How about a vaccine?"
00:33:31.926,00:33:40.435,"Um… All right, well, thank you, guys. That was really fun."
00:33:40.518,00:33:44.439,And it's also the last time they're ever gonna let me have a prop.
00:33:49.110,00:33:55.950,"Now, to do all the jokes he forgot to do during the interviews, it's David Spade with After Thoughts."
00:34:01.581,00:34:05.835,"Well, Fortune, I learned a lot talking to the cast of To All the Boys."
00:34:06.544,00:34:17.263,"I learned from Janel that To All the Boys used a move from the Adam Sandler playbook: find an exotic location you wanna hang out in with your buddies, write a scene there, and then live it up."
00:34:22.101,00:34:25.480,I also learned that she thinks Pottery Barn is a magazine.
00:34:27.356,00:34:33.905,"I learned that Anna is known as an older sibling of the crew, which is just a nice way of saying she's the narc."
00:34:35.948,00:34:39.368,I learned that Noah was bummed there wasn't a blooper reel on his movie.
00:34:39.452,00:34:43.831,"He needs to work out more on a mistake-filled set, like this show."
00:34:47.585,00:34:49.003,Bloopers for days.
00:34:50.755,00:34:52.924,I learned that Lana's sad the movie's over.
00:34:53.007,00:34:57.345,"Don't worry, you'll be getting pitched movies like this one for the next 30 years."
00:34:58.596,00:35:04.685,"Thank you so much, Lana, Noah, Anna, and Janel for being so cool."
00:35:04.769,00:35:07.730,"That's our show, everybody. Thanks to the cast for being here."
00:35:07.814,00:35:08.773,Thank you so much.
00:35:08.856,00:35:12.944,"To All the Boys: Always and Forever streaming now, click on it."
00:35:13.027,00:35:17.532,See you next time on the Afterparty with the cast of Fate: The Winx Saga.
00:35:17.615,00:35:18.616,Good night.
00:35:19.242,00:35:20.451,Goodbye.
