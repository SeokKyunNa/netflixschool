00:00:27.193,00:00:30.130,is going to be waging a new war in the Middle East.
00:00:30.597,00:00:33.266,And I have to admit that maybe it's the right way to go.
00:00:33.333,00:00:36.770,The threat of terrorism looms larger than ever in America.
00:00:37.037,00:00:45.044,"In fact, this week, Homeland Security updated the color-coded warning system that the Bush administration created after 9/11."
00:00:45.111,00:00:52.819,"The old warning levels were low, guarded, elevated, high, and severe."
00:00:53.586,00:00:56.623,"Now, the updated warning levels are going to be..."
00:00:57.323,00:01:05.632,"be afraid, be very afraid, be freaking terrified, shit's about to hit the fan, and, you know what, you're pretty much fucked."
00:01:05.698,00:01:09.602,"Anyway, enough of this political nonsense, let's bring out the fart machine."
00:01:10.637,00:01:11.604,Yay.
00:01:19.446,00:01:20.613,Why are you watching this?
00:01:22.315,00:01:24.184,I don't know. It's funny.
00:01:25.185,00:01:26.319,Why are you drawing that?
00:01:29.222,00:01:32.492,"-I don't know. -I don't know either, but it worries me."
00:01:46.372,00:01:47.874,How many glasses is that for you?
00:01:48.875,00:01:49.876,-One. -Two.
00:01:50.143,00:01:51.511,-It's three. -Whatever.
00:01:51.578,00:01:52.846,Jesus drank wine.
00:01:53.113,00:01:56.783,Carl says we're this close to landing a deal. Do you know what that would mean?
00:01:56.850,00:01:59.452,A government contract in the Middle East during a war?
00:01:59.519,00:02:01.387,"That's great, honey. Kip, eat your food."
00:02:04.290,00:02:05.658,"Well, I think the war is wrong."
00:02:06.292,00:02:08.695,"Yeah? Regardless of what you think, it's gonna happen."
00:02:08.761,00:02:11.464,And somebody's gotta be there to clear up the mess.
00:02:11.531,00:02:14.167,And what is this? What are you doing with this?
00:02:14.567,00:02:17.537,-You gotta stop it with this. -I don't know why he's doing that.
00:02:19.305,00:02:20.173,A deer?
00:02:32.418,00:02:33.386,Sally.
00:02:35.889,00:02:36.823,"Hey, Sally."
00:02:37.557,00:02:38.725,-What are you doing? -Yeah?
00:02:38.791,00:02:40.660,-I'm taking a break. -Your break's over.
00:02:40.727,00:02:41.928,Come over and look at this.
00:02:44.197,00:02:46.166,What do you think of when you look at that?
00:02:47.433,00:02:48.535,The Second World War?
00:02:48.601,00:02:50.570,Really? Why does it make you think of that?
00:02:51.838,00:02:54.674,It makes me think of the worst thing I can imagine.
00:02:54.741,00:02:56.442,And that would be the Holocaust.
00:03:00.246,00:03:02.282,Do you wanna see what I'm working on?
00:03:02.348,00:03:03.850,Do you think it needs more red?
00:03:08.421,00:03:11.624,evokes a sense of anxiety in the spectator.
00:03:12.559,00:03:13.593,"Yes, so?"
00:03:14.594,00:03:20.199,"So, if somebody was gonna buy this and hang it up on their wall, they might not be able to relax."
00:03:22.635,00:03:24.771,so that the whole fucking world can relax more?
00:03:25.672,00:03:29.375,"Well, wouldn't the world be a better place if we could all just relax?"
00:03:29.842,00:03:30.944,Sally.
00:03:32.312,00:03:33.580,Get me another bottle of red.
00:03:43.957,00:03:45.925,"-Goodnight, Kippie. -Goodnight, Mom."
00:03:51.598,00:03:52.932,Messy boy.
00:03:53.833,00:03:55.902,"-Mess, mess, mess. -Sorry."
00:04:01.341,00:04:03.443,Why do you have the need to draw this stuff?
00:04:05.245,00:04:08.414,-It's fun. -Not really.
00:04:09.282,00:04:12.452,Drawing is something you do in kindergarten to get out of your system.
00:04:12.518,00:04:13.553,Now you need to stop.
00:04:14.654,00:04:16.623,Lots of people do it for a living though.
00:04:16.689,00:04:19.525,Not really. Not if you want to be taken seriously.
00:04:19.592,00:04:21.327,"Art isn't a real thing, Kip."
00:04:21.794,00:04:22.762,What do you mean?
00:04:22.829,00:04:24.964,"Well, I had a friend in college who painted..."
00:04:25.031,00:04:27.033,-Was she good? -She thought she was.
00:04:27.600,00:04:29.636,"God, she was so full of herself."
00:04:30.703,00:04:35.808,"-Maybe I could go to art school someday. -Well, you know, I will support whatever you wanna do."
00:04:36.542,00:04:39.979,As long as it means going to Yale and studying in the financial sector.
00:04:40.046,00:04:41.848,"-Goodnight, Kip. -Goodnight, Dad."
00:04:41.914,00:04:44.851,"Come on, honey. Let him sleep. He's too big to get tucked in."
00:04:45.551,00:04:48.021,I'm not tucking him in. I'm just hanging out.
00:04:49.055,00:04:51.524,"It's cool to hang out with your mom, isn't it, Kip?"
00:04:51.824,00:04:52.992,Sure. Heh.
00:04:54.727,00:04:57.563,"Sweetheart, you can be anything you want, okay?"
00:04:58.531,00:05:00.033,"Just don't be, you know..."
00:05:00.633,00:05:01.501,this.
00:05:01.567,00:05:02.535,Let's go.
00:05:04.470,00:05:05.938,"Oh, my God. You know what?"
00:05:06.005,00:05:07.840,I studied finance in college.
00:05:08.374,00:05:12.345,"Yeah, well, you were undecided until senior year, and then you dropped out."
00:05:13.379,00:05:15.515,"Well, you give up certain things to be a mother."
00:05:16.349,00:05:20.853,"And being a mother entitles you to some things, like hanging out with your son."
00:05:24.824,00:05:25.692,"Goodnight, honey."
00:05:31.931,00:05:33.833,"Excuse me, it pays the bills."
00:05:33.900,00:05:36.102,-Right. -It's the only thing that pays the bills.
00:05:36.369,00:05:38.905,-Somebody has to be the breadwinner. -Why is it always me?
00:05:38.971,00:05:40.506,Because you're more masculine.
00:05:40.573,00:05:43.042,-I'm not masculine. -I didn't say you were masculine.
00:05:43.109,00:05:46.679,-I said you're more masculine than I am. -How am I more masculine than you?
00:05:46.746,00:05:49.882,"Well, many ways. But you like to strap on the dildo all the time."
00:05:49.949,00:05:52.618,-You are helping me tomorrow. -I'm not. I can't.
00:05:52.685,00:05:56.689,It's gonna exhaust my brain-- I can't break my spirit like that.
00:05:56.756,00:05:58.958,"-I can't take it anymore. -Oh, God."
00:05:59.025,00:06:01.894,I'm working 12 hours a day at the studio. It's gonna pay off.
00:06:01.961,00:06:04.564,You just have to just ride it out with me a little bit.
00:06:04.630,00:06:05.865,-Ride it out? Really? -Yeah.
00:06:05.932,00:06:06.799,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:06:06.866,00:06:09.669,You really think painting shit like this is gonna pay off?
00:06:09.736,00:06:12.004,What the hell is this?
00:06:13.573,00:06:14.574,-That painting? -Yeah.
00:06:14.640,00:06:16.809,It's the cycle of life.
00:06:16.876,00:06:19.712,-The cycle of life? -That's the end of the cycle.
00:06:23.750,00:06:25.384,-What? -I'm not happy.
00:06:26.419,00:06:27.086,This isn't fair.
00:06:31.524,00:06:32.592,"Okay, okay."
00:06:33.860,00:06:34.761,Um...
00:06:36.562,00:06:41.934,"This collector. He's coming to the studio. He's supposedly really rich, and he's, like, eccentric."
00:06:45.171,00:06:47.106,-Are we still religious? -Not really.
00:06:48.674,00:06:49.842,Then why do we still pray?
00:06:50.409,00:06:51.077,Just in case.
00:06:52.945,00:06:55.081,Are we going to war again with the Middle East?
00:06:55.148,00:06:56.783,-Yes. -Why?
00:06:57.483,00:06:59.018,Because they won't do what we say.
00:07:01.621,00:07:04.423,"-I'm sorry, Mrs. Salt. -No, don't apologize."
00:07:04.924,00:07:05.792,You're right.
00:07:08.528,00:07:12.799,"Sweetheart, if someone bigger and better than you tells you to do something, do it."
00:07:12.865,00:07:13.766,Why?
00:07:14.734,00:07:17.537,Because their knowledge is what made them bigger and better.
00:07:17.603,00:07:19.972,"Yeah, how's that for a freaking birthday present."
00:07:20.039,00:07:22.175,"It's a very encouraging e-mail, don't you think?"
00:07:25.945,00:07:28.848,"Okay, I'll see you tonight, buddy."
00:07:30.183,00:07:31.918,Good morning.
00:07:33.986,00:07:35.922,"It's a beautiful, beautiful day."
00:07:35.988,00:07:39.125,"-A beautiful, beautiful day. -You're in a good mood."
00:07:39.192,00:07:43.095,"Well, we just got a very encouraging e-mail from Phil Price at the Pentagon."
00:07:43.162,00:07:45.832,He's the head of the committee for defense contractors.
00:07:45.898,00:07:50.770,"-Oh, that sounds promising. -Can you imagine if we land this contract tonight of all nights?"
00:07:53.873,00:07:58.811,"I'm am praying this deal goes through. Pray-- Oh, Jesus. Donna?"
00:07:58.878,00:08:00.613,"Oh, I've got it, Mr. Salt."
00:08:02.215,00:08:05.017,-I'm just such a klutz. Jesus. -Not a problem.
00:08:08.221,00:08:09.989,"Oh, you meant that as a compliment."
00:08:10.857,00:08:12.825,It's positively vulgar.
00:08:14.026,00:08:16.162,"-But in a good way. -Oh, thanks."
00:08:17.063,00:08:20.933,I do think most of us are in some sort of stupor.
00:08:21.000,00:08:24.270,-Clueless consumers with lobotomies. -Yeah.
00:08:24.537,00:08:27.039,"Yeah, consumerism is a big part of my work."
00:08:27.874,00:08:30.610,-You've heard of Black Friday. -Of course.
00:08:30.676,00:08:36.516,"You've seen the videos of people storming the stores -like rabid cattle. -Yeah, right."
00:08:36.582,00:08:37.917,Like rabid cattle.
00:08:39.619,00:08:45.758,"But this work, this work seems to say, Wake up!"
00:08:45.825,00:08:48.794,Right. That's my hope. To wake people up.
00:08:50.196,00:08:51.264,Very interesting.
00:08:52.198,00:08:54.734,"Of course, I could never hang any of this on my wall."
00:08:56.569,00:08:57.837,My wife would never allow it.
00:08:58.237,00:09:01.207,Maybe you should show your wife who wears the pants.
00:09:01.274,00:09:03.175,"Ashley, be reasonable."
00:09:03.242,00:09:05.845,This is the kind of work that could drive someone mad.
00:09:05.912,00:09:07.046,What? Because of the red?
00:09:07.847,00:09:10.950,"Come on, I do other paintings-- I could use yellow."
00:09:11.017,00:09:12.251,It's not the red.
00:09:12.919,00:09:15.855,It's the subject matter. It's insane.
00:09:16.255,00:09:18.624,Isn't our state of unawareness insane?
00:09:18.691,00:09:22.061,Don't we need insanity to pull us out of our current insanity?
00:09:23.062,00:09:24.630,This is interesting.
00:09:25.665,00:09:26.666,What is this?
00:09:27.934,00:09:30.703,-Excuse me. -Oh. Yeah?
00:09:31.070,00:09:32.138,Uh...
00:09:32.204,00:09:35.274,"-Do you draw these bunnies? -Oh, yeah."
00:09:36.108,00:09:38.110,Why do you express yourself in this way?
00:09:39.312,00:09:45.885,"-What are you talking about? -These blue bunnies, well, they're so sincere, and so hopeful."
00:09:48.120,00:09:50.690,Bunnies are cute. Um...
00:09:50.756,00:09:53.926,And they're sexual but unthreatening.
00:09:55.061,00:09:56.128,Don't drink tonight.
00:09:57.096,00:09:58.264,That's a strange request.
00:09:58.764,00:10:01.033,"Well, It's not a request. Just don't drink tonight."
00:10:01.100,00:10:03.703,It's a party. You're supposed to drink at these things.
00:10:03.769,00:10:06.772,This is a very important night. I don't want you to embarrass me.
00:10:07.173,00:10:09.675,-What do you mean? -You know what I mean.
00:10:10.776,00:10:13.045,You're implying that I'm embarrassing when I drink.
00:10:13.112,00:10:13.980,Yeah.
00:10:16.248,00:10:18.751,"Stanley, do I embarrass you?"
00:10:18.818,00:10:21.654,"When you drink too much, Veronica, yes, you embarrass me."
00:10:22.755,00:10:25.758,Why are you telling me this? I thought you liked it when I drink.
00:10:25.825,00:10:27.827,Why would I like it when you drink?
00:10:28.260,00:10:31.197,"Oh, come on. A party without alcohol, it might as well be AA."
00:10:31.263,00:10:34.000,"-Maybe you should go home. -Stanley, what is your problem?"
00:10:36.736,00:10:41.774,"You're on very thin ice right now, and it cracks every time you put a glass of wine down your throat."
00:10:41.841,00:10:43.142,What is that supposed to mean?
00:10:43.209,00:10:46.312,-What do you think it means? -No idea. You never speak in metaphors.
00:10:46.379,00:10:49.982,Just go home and I'll tell Carl that you got sick or something.
00:10:51.050,00:10:52.118,But I'm not sick.
00:10:54.987,00:10:57.189,"-Stanley, are you unhappy? -Oh."
00:10:59.392,00:11:02.328,"-Stanley, answer the question. -Look at me. Do I look happy?"
00:11:04.930,00:11:08.167,"-Maybe you're happy on the inside? -I am not happy, Veronica."
00:11:13.439,00:11:16.208,"-It's all right. I want you to-- -No. It's about me, too."
00:11:16.275,00:11:26.886,-I'm not gonna leave you alone. -I said-- -Just stuffing your face? -I'm sorry.
00:11:26.952,00:11:29.055,"Babe, I need your help. Please, take this."
00:11:29.121,00:11:30.956,-I love you. Go. -I'm sorry.
00:11:31.023,00:11:31.924,Stop it.
00:11:33.759,00:11:34.994,You made a mess in here.
00:11:36.128,00:11:37.029,You want one?
00:11:43.069,00:11:46.405,I thought maybe it's that much. Let it be bigger. The more the merrier.
00:11:46.472,00:11:49.809,"-The bigger the war, the better... -You're gonna need more employees."
00:11:49.875,00:11:52.111,-The understatement of the year. -Hire the locals.
00:12:02.955,00:12:05.991,This country was built on the backs of hard-working entrepreneurs.
00:12:06.058,00:12:09.361,"-There he is, the birthday boy. -Oh, I love him! My Stanley."
00:12:09.428,00:12:12.364,-How are you? You look great. -So do you. My God.
00:12:12.431,00:12:14.867,-So beautiful. How are you? -I'm really good.
00:12:14.934,00:12:16.836,It's silky. Silky.
00:12:20.206,00:12:22.741,I'm not good at this. I should get out of here.
00:12:22.808,00:12:25.478,Forget the decapitated heads and shit. I'll do flowers.
00:12:25.744,00:12:27.379,I'll paint flowers. I'll get us money.
00:12:27.446,00:12:32.418,"-I can get us money. -Just stand behind the bar and serve drinks, okay? Everything's going to be all right."
00:12:34.086,00:12:35.087,Serve some drinks.
00:12:35.154,00:12:37.156,"-So, how's Kip? -Oh, he's great."
00:12:37.223,00:12:38.824,May I offer you a drink?
00:12:38.891,00:12:40.159,"Oh, Um..."
00:12:40.926,00:12:42.928,-I'm fine. Thank you. -Are you sure?
00:12:56.308,00:12:58.244,More champagne.
00:12:59.879,00:13:00.946,Cheers.
00:13:10.990,00:13:12.258,I need another one of these.
00:13:14.527,00:13:16.395,"-Um... Yeah, red? -Yeah."
00:13:16.462,00:13:20.166,"Jesus, you look like -someone I went to college with. -Lucky you."
00:13:20.933,00:13:22.334,"Jesus, you look just like her."
00:13:28.541,00:13:29.542,"Hi, Veronica."
00:13:31.177,00:13:33.812,"-Oh, my freaking God. Ashley? -Uh..."
00:13:34.513,00:13:36.582,"-Oh... -Oh, my God!"
00:13:38.884,00:13:41.587,"Holy shit, I can't believe it. Um..."
00:13:42.054,00:13:46.058,Wow! Uh-- What have you been up to?
00:13:46.559,00:13:49.161,"-I mean, um, besides this? -Uh..."
00:13:50.296,00:13:55.367,"Oh, this--? Yeah, I'm-- -I'm helping out a friend. -Of course. I wasn't judging you."
00:13:55.434,00:13:56.502,"No, no. I know."
00:13:56.569,00:13:59.538,"I mean, I waited tables once for a week. Maybe it was a day."
00:14:00.239,00:14:02.942,"-Ha. -Wait, no. I didn't."
00:14:03.309,00:14:05.511,Um-- But are you--?
00:14:05.578,00:14:06.879,Are you in New York?
00:14:07.947,00:14:09.281,Yep.
00:14:09.348,00:14:12.218,I had no idea. I've never seen you.
00:14:12.284,00:14:14.520,"-So, where are you? -Um... Bushwick."
00:14:17.890,00:14:18.557,Bushwick.
00:14:19.558,00:14:20.459,Of course.
00:14:23.062,00:14:25.598,We have an apartment in SoHo.
00:14:26.398,00:14:28.534,And a little place in the Hamptons.
00:14:28.601,00:14:30.236,Hmm. Cool.
00:14:31.604,00:14:35.474,"Oh, my God, this is so crazy. This is my husband's party."
00:14:35.541,00:14:36.408,"-Oh, yeah? -Yeah."
00:14:36.475,00:14:39.445,He's over there with his big shot business partner.
00:14:39.511,00:14:43.148,"They're, like, gonna close a really big, um, account."
00:14:43.215,00:14:44.250,"Oh, cool."
00:14:44.316,00:14:45.618,It's cool. Which one is he?
00:14:46.652,00:14:50.055,-He's-- See those two guys by the couch? -Yeah.
00:14:50.890,00:14:52.091,He's the tall handsome one.
00:14:53.993,00:14:55.227,-For real? -Mm-hm.
00:14:55.294,00:14:57.529,"Wow, I thought those guys were gay."
00:14:58.197,00:15:01.333,"They were acting so gay. Like gay, gay, gay."
00:15:03.135,00:15:05.471,"-Why would you think that? -No, nothing. I'm kidding."
00:15:05.537,00:15:07.673,He's great. He's just so lovely.
00:15:07.940,00:15:08.941,My husband's not gay.
00:15:09.008,00:15:10.442,-No-- -We have a beautiful son.
00:15:10.509,00:15:11.510,-Don't-- I know. -Yeah.
00:15:11.577,00:15:12.945,-Don't get offended. -So...
00:15:13.012,00:15:14.647,"Honestly, it was a joke."
00:15:14.914,00:15:16.982,He's really handsome.
00:15:17.049,00:15:17.983,"-Mm-hm, -Yeah. Yeah."
00:15:20.352,00:15:23.455,"-So, what about you? Are you married? -Ha."
00:15:25.324,00:15:26.926,"Oh, no. Wait. Yes. You're right."
00:15:26.992,00:15:28.494,"Because you're gay, right?"
00:15:29.628,00:15:31.163,"-Yeah, you remembered, huh? -Mm-hm."
00:15:31.997,00:15:33.098,"Of course, I remembered."
00:15:34.366,00:15:35.267,That's when...
00:15:37.036,00:15:39.038,I stopped hanging out with you.
00:15:39.405,00:15:40.339,"Oh, really?"
00:15:41.674,00:15:43.475,I...
00:15:43.542,00:15:49.381,"Well, you know, I pretty much remembered -that I stopped hanging out with you. -You know what?"
00:15:49.448,00:15:51.450,"Okay, hold on a second. Wait, wait, wait."
00:15:52.084,00:15:55.087,I didn't stop hanging out with you because you were gay.
00:15:55.154,00:15:56.388,"-It's just... -Oh, my God."
00:15:58.324,00:16:01.327,"I had to, you know, make that call."
00:16:03.395,00:16:04.263,Ah!
00:16:04.330,00:16:07.967,Anyway. What is your story now? Are you still doing that art thing you do?
00:16:09.435,00:16:10.436,The art thing?
00:16:11.337,00:16:14.373,"-Yeah, Veronica, I'm still doing-- -Yeah, the painting thing?"
00:16:14.440,00:16:16.308,"The painting thing, I still do it. Yeah."
00:16:16.375,00:16:18.677,"-Really, you stayed with it, huh? -I stayed with it?"
00:16:20.112,00:16:28.554,"You don't just stay with it. It's your life commitment-- What am I talking about this for? I can't even believe-- My son, he wants to be an artist."
00:16:28.620,00:16:31.357,"Oh, God, I'm trying to talk him out of it."
00:16:32.091,00:16:33.759,And why would you do that?
00:16:36.295,00:16:37.229,Why do you think?
00:16:42.201,00:16:45.471,-I know we're here for Carl's birthday. -I think that's good news.
00:16:50.042,00:16:58.417,our company will be handling all the debris disposal throughout the Middle East construction phase of this war.
00:16:58.484,00:17:00.285,Raise a glass to trash.
00:17:14.233,00:17:15.134,Whoo!
00:17:15.200,00:17:17.102,"Oh, my trash man."
00:17:17.169,00:17:18.504,"Oh, you're making us rich."
00:17:19.104,00:17:21.673,"-You're making us rich. I love it. -Veronica, you're drunk."
00:17:22.107,00:17:24.777,"-Oh. No, babe. I'm totally not. -You're hammered."
00:17:25.044,00:17:27.079,"-No, I'm fine. -And I asked you not to drink."
00:17:27.146,00:17:29.581,-You need to go home. Now. -What?
00:17:32.618,00:17:35.087,I'll see you at home. Just go home. Okay?
00:17:57.443,00:18:00.112,"-God, watch it! -You watch it."
00:18:00.179,00:18:02.114,-What are you doing? -What are you doing?
00:18:02.181,00:18:04.550,Why are you standing in the middle of the stairwell?
00:18:04.616,00:18:07.719,"-I'm just standing here. -Oh, my God. Are you smoking pot?"
00:18:07.786,00:18:09.688,"-Oh, you're pathetic. -Oh, my God."
00:18:09.755,00:18:12.124,"Oh, you're pathetic. What are you?"
00:18:12.191,00:18:16.395,"-You're a fucking caterer, Ashley. -You're a fucking trophy wife, Veronica."
00:18:16.462,00:18:19.698,"-I am a mother. -Man, I feel sorry for your fucking kid."
00:18:21.667,00:18:22.734,"Oh, my God."
00:18:27.840,00:18:29.708,"Oh, God."
00:19:16.288,00:19:17.356,You touched me?
00:21:58.417,00:22:02.554,We're approaching the two-year anniversary of the new war in the Middle East.
00:22:03.455,00:22:04.656,It seemed to be going well.
00:22:04.723,00:22:07.659,Then the president did something nobody saw coming.
00:22:08.860,00:22:10.329,He reinstated the draft.
00:22:13.098,00:22:15.667,"Very, very unpopular move, at first."
00:22:15.734,00:22:21.373,"But as the president predicted, the draft is having a positive effect on the economy."
00:22:21.440,00:22:26.411,"In fact, the president's poll numbers are actually surging in parts of the South and Midwest."
00:22:27.012,00:22:30.582,That's what happens when you force blacks and Latinos to leave the country.
00:22:30.649,00:22:31.883,The hillbillies just love you.
00:22:33.585,00:22:36.688,"Anyway, anyway, enough of this political nonsense."
00:22:36.755,00:22:38.857,Let's bring out the fart machine.
00:22:59.778,00:23:00.645,"Oh, my."
00:23:01.046,00:23:02.147,"Oh, Mrs. Salt?"
00:23:03.048,00:23:04.015,You're awake?
00:23:05.584,00:23:06.551,Doctor!
00:23:07.519,00:23:09.020,Doctor! We need a doctor!
00:23:09.087,00:23:12.991,"My name is Dr. Jones, and I'm the comatose doctor at Mercy General."
00:23:13.725,00:23:15.393,The comatose doctor?
00:23:15.460,00:23:18.396,"Yes, I specialize in comatose patients here at the hospital."
00:23:18.463,00:23:19.131,Okay.
00:23:19.564,00:23:25.737,"I know this is gonna come as a bit of a shock, Mrs. Salt, but you've been in a coma for two years."
00:23:26.938,00:23:28.106,What?
00:23:28.173,00:23:30.876,-You've been in a coma for two years. -I know.
00:23:30.942,00:23:33.812,"I heard you the first time, but... what?"
00:23:33.879,00:23:39.618,"You suffered a massive brain injury, and frankly, we didn't think you were gonna come out of it."
00:23:39.684,00:23:42.521,But I'm happy you regained consciousness when you did.
00:23:42.587,00:23:50.562,"We've been unable to withdraw funds from your bank, actually, and we were in the process of moving you to another facility."
00:23:50.629,00:23:51.930,But I have health insurance.
00:23:51.997,00:23:57.035,"Actually, you had a government-issued health policy and those were discontinued last year."
00:23:57.102,00:24:00.005,We've been pulling funds directly from your savings account.
00:24:00.071,00:24:03.175,But this doesn't make any sense. My family is rich.
00:24:03.608,00:24:06.545,There should be plenty of funds to pull from.
00:24:06.611,00:24:08.046,Mrs. Salt.
00:24:08.513,00:24:10.081,I have some bad news.
00:24:15.954,00:24:17.455,Mr. Salt is dead.
00:24:21.092,00:24:22.527,A terrible accident.
00:24:24.963,00:24:25.864,Where's Kip?
00:24:26.765,00:24:30.101,"Oh, I need to see my son. Where's Kippie?"
00:24:33.471,00:24:34.172,What?
00:24:35.106,00:24:36.908,"Your son is dead, too."
00:24:39.010,00:24:40.045,What?
00:24:41.246,00:24:43.682,"Wait, are you joking?"
00:24:43.849,00:24:46.151,What? This can't be happening.
00:24:46.585,00:24:50.188,What--? Is this--? This is a... What is going on?
00:24:50.255,00:24:52.257,It's okay. It's okay.
00:24:52.524,00:24:54.826,-This is a nightmare. -I'll go get her a sedative.
00:24:54.893,00:24:56.695,"-Oh, my God. -Can you get me one, too?"
00:25:01.533,00:25:04.669,"-No, it's not. -I'm sorry, Mrs. Salt. I'm so sorry."
00:25:04.736,00:25:07.672,-Wait. My son is dead? -Yes.
00:25:07.839,00:25:10.141,-How? -He died in the war.
00:25:10.742,00:25:13.912,The war? My son died...?
00:25:13.979,00:25:16.715,-How long have I been asleep again? -Two years.
00:25:17.082,00:25:18.049,Two years.
00:25:18.650,00:25:22.888,"That means that Kip is only 17, he's too young to serve in the military."
00:25:22.954,00:25:25.523,They lowered the age to serve to 16.
00:25:26.091,00:25:27.626,My own son was drafted.
00:25:27.692,00:25:29.728,What? How can they do that?
00:25:29.794,00:25:31.663,It was something the congress decided.
00:25:31.730,00:25:34.833,"They said if you're old enough to drive, you're old enough to kill."
00:25:34.900,00:25:37.869,"-How old is the drinking age, then? -It's still 21."
00:25:38.937,00:25:41.740,This must be so much of a shock to you.
00:25:42.107,00:25:45.310,"I'm so-- You-- No family, no home, and you're broke."
00:25:46.011,00:25:47.245,But you're awake.
00:25:47.846,00:25:50.715,"-And you look great. -What do you mean, I'm broke?"
00:25:51.917,00:25:53.051,It's all gone.
00:25:53.985,00:25:55.253,Didn't you hear the doctor?
00:25:56.588,00:25:58.924,They used all your assets to pay for the hospital.
00:26:01.760,00:26:03.128,I don't understand.
00:26:04.162,00:26:05.864,I don't have anything?
00:26:06.598,00:26:09.868,"Oh, I have a small box of your belongings."
00:26:09.935,00:26:11.269,I saved them for you.
00:26:21.980,00:26:24.282,"Oh, my God, Donna. Hold my hand, please."
00:26:24.349,00:26:25.817,"Oh, Donna, hold my hand."
00:26:25.884,00:26:27.152,What am I gonna do?
00:26:27.218,00:26:29.721,"Oh, my God, Donna. What am I gonna do?"
00:26:30.155,00:26:31.957,I can't tell you what it means to me.
00:26:32.023,00:26:34.993,I'm so grateful that you've been by my side this whole time.
00:26:36.928,00:26:39.331,"Well, that's not quite true."
00:26:40.098,00:26:42.367,I work for the hospital.
00:26:43.001,00:26:44.669,They hired me last week.
00:26:45.704,00:26:47.072,I clean the rooms.
00:27:06.925,00:27:08.226,How much is this one?
00:27:09.794,00:27:10.829,Excuse me.
00:27:14.933,00:27:15.800,Yeah?
00:27:16.167,00:27:17.669,How much for this piece?
00:27:18.169,00:27:20.772,"Oh, this one sold already this morning."
00:27:21.306,00:27:22.340,Oh.
00:27:29.948,00:27:32.784,"-What about this one? -That one sold, too."
00:27:33.718,00:27:37.322,"Well, if they're sold, why haven't you put the little red stickers on them?"
00:27:37.389,00:27:38.289,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:40.425,00:27:44.429,They've been selling so fast that sometimes I just forget about them.
00:27:49.034,00:27:50.735,"Yeah, it's pretty grim."
00:27:51.336,00:27:53.905,-These are grim times. -Yeah.
00:27:55.807,00:27:57.175,Has everything sold?
00:27:57.842,00:28:00.745,Um... No. We have one left. Follow me.
00:28:06.918,00:28:07.986,There it is.
00:28:08.453,00:28:10.021,Is that what I think it is?
00:28:11.122,00:28:12.290,What do you think it is?
00:28:13.291,00:28:14.859,A decapitated sperm.
00:28:15.794,00:28:17.896,"Yes, that's it. It's a decapitated sperm."
00:28:19.030,00:28:19.898,How much?
00:28:19.964,00:28:21.766,-Five thousand. -I'll take it.
00:28:26.704,00:28:27.806,Ta-da!
00:28:30.408,00:28:31.309,"Thank you, friend."
00:28:32.310,00:28:34.012,There's not as much as last time.
00:28:34.879,00:28:36.848,"Yeah, can't really control that though."
00:28:43.254,00:28:44.322,Open up.
00:28:45.957,00:28:47.025,Okay.
00:28:48.193,00:28:50.228,"-Okay. More. -Oh, man."
00:28:50.295,00:28:53.131,"If I open up any more, you could go spelunking down there."
00:28:53.298,00:28:55.734,-Okay. Ready? -Yeah.
00:28:57.268,00:28:58.136,Ah!
00:28:58.803,00:29:01.039,I have a good feeling about this.
00:29:01.106,00:29:02.307,-Get your legs up. -Okay.
00:29:07.412,00:29:08.513,What if I'm too old?
00:29:10.148,00:29:11.850,That's not what the doctor said.
00:29:13.051,00:29:15.420,How could you possibly be infertile?
00:29:17.822,00:29:21.493,-It's okay. We're gonna be mommies. -Mm-hm.
00:29:22.193,00:29:24.229,-Mommies. -Mm-hm.
00:29:24.329,00:29:27.065,The last time I had sperm in me was in the 2nd grade.
00:29:28.266,00:29:32.170,You can't make jokes like that when the baby comes.
00:29:36.541,00:29:38.309,What if this baby has two heads?
00:29:40.311,00:29:44.082,"Well, then he'll breastfeed on both breasts simultaneously."
00:29:44.282,00:29:45.150,Cute.
00:29:49.020,00:29:50.522,You're doing so good.
00:29:51.289,00:29:54.526,"Just take one step, and then after that, you take another step."
00:29:54.793,00:29:55.860,Is that how you do it?
00:29:55.927,00:29:57.996,"You take one step, and then another? Really?"
00:29:58.062,00:29:59.998,"Yeah. It's like riding a bike, remember?"
00:30:00.064,00:30:03.568,"Oh, is that how you ride a bike? You take one step, and then another."
00:30:03.835,00:30:06.838,"Okay, Veronica. Try and stay positive."
00:30:06.905,00:30:09.007,-It's a beautiful day. -Please don't say that.
00:30:09.073,00:30:11.075,"-Oh, why? -My husband used to say that."
00:30:11.142,00:30:13.144,Oh. Sorry. I was trying to keep things positive.
00:30:13.211,00:30:15.313,It's hard feeling positive at the moment.
00:30:15.380,00:30:18.049,"-I understand that. -You know, I don't think you do."
00:30:18.116,00:30:20.051,My husband blew his head off with a gun.
00:30:20.118,00:30:21.352,That's a terrible thing.
00:30:21.419,00:30:23.922,Focus on you putting one foot in front of the other.
00:30:23.988,00:30:26.024,-My son is dead. Did you know that? -I know.
00:30:26.090,00:30:28.393,"He probably got his head blown off, too."
00:30:28.459,00:30:30.528,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive.
00:30:30.595,00:30:34.032,My only living relative is a madwoman living in a cabin in Maine.
00:30:34.098,00:30:35.266,My life sucks.
00:30:35.533,00:30:38.169,-Who is this relative? -My aunt.
00:30:38.236,00:30:41.940,-I was told you didn't have any family. -I haven't spoken to her in years.
00:30:46.511,00:30:48.980,"I understand that, but I think you should call her."
00:30:49.047,00:30:51.216,"-No way. No, I can't do that. -You should."
00:30:51.482,00:30:54.485,-Why? -Because you can't stay here anymore.
00:30:55.220,00:30:56.955,"No, I'm not ready to leave."
00:30:57.422,00:30:58.556,This is your last day.
00:30:59.290,00:31:00.358,What?
00:31:13.304,00:31:15.440,I know you're upset.
00:31:15.506,00:31:18.209,"Oh, I feel it, too."
00:31:19.210,00:31:22.413,"Sometimes I get so angry, I wanna torpedo the world."
00:31:23.081,00:31:24.449,"Oh, but just breathe."
00:31:25.049,00:31:26.317,Just breathe.
00:31:29.520,00:31:31.489,Just keep those tentacles where they are.
00:31:37.362,00:31:39.197,-Hello. -Aunt Charlie?
00:31:39.264,00:31:42.166,-It's Veronica. -Veronica?
00:31:42.233,00:31:43.601,How are you doing?
00:31:43.668,00:31:45.203,"I'm rotting away, Veronica."
00:31:46.905,00:31:52.410,-What do you want? -I don't suppose you heard the news?
00:31:53.411,00:31:55.380,-What happened? -Fuck the news!
00:31:55.446,00:31:57.916,They don't report on what's really happening.
00:31:57.982,00:31:59.550,"Charlie, I need a place to stay."
00:31:59.617,00:32:02.487,They only report on things that happen above the surface.
00:32:02.553,00:32:03.988,That's not the issue.
00:32:04.255,00:32:05.957,It's below us.
00:32:06.024,00:32:07.358,Inside the earth.
00:32:08.026,00:32:11.029,Deep down to the core. The big mutiny is happening down there.
00:32:11.095,00:32:15.633,"Charlie. Listen to me. I need a-- Listen to me, Veronica. I'm trying to assuage her."
00:32:15.700,00:32:16.968,But she's not happy.
00:32:17.435,00:32:20.038,"Pretty soon, she's gonna blow, and when that happens..."
00:32:20.104,00:32:21.406,"Okay, goodbye, Aunt Charlie."
00:32:21.472,00:32:24.175,-...tentacles are gonna come out-- -Lunatic.
00:32:26.044,00:32:29.414,"So, you sold... all the work?"
00:32:29.647,00:32:31.015,Yeah. Yeah.
00:32:31.649,00:32:33.418,-Very impressive. -Thanks.
00:32:33.985,00:32:36.387,"-I was wrong about you. -Well, yeah."
00:32:36.454,00:32:39.624,"No, the war has changed the country's mindset."
00:32:39.691,00:32:44.095,The draft has made people accept the horrors of war...
00:32:44.696,00:32:46.331,and you're capitalizing on it.
00:32:47.365,00:32:49.500,"Well, I wouldn't say I was capitalizing on it."
00:32:49.567,00:32:52.070,I'm expressing the collective dread of the country.
00:32:52.136,00:32:54.172,"More like exploiting the dread, but..."
00:32:55.106,00:32:56.708,I wouldn't put it that way.
00:32:57.508,00:33:01.145,"I'm merely expressing what I feel, and then I'm putting it on the canvas."
00:33:01.212,00:33:04.282,Are you still...? Excuse me. Are you still painting the bunnies?
00:33:04.349,00:33:05.583,Excuse me. Excuse me?
00:33:06.084,00:33:08.686,"-Are you still painting those bunnies? -Oh, yeah."
00:33:09.487,00:33:12.490,-Heh. She's adorable. -Yeah.
00:33:12.557,00:33:16.260,"So hopeful. I love her work, too."
00:33:16.327,00:33:19.530,"You should look at it at her studio. Oh, yeah, she doesn't have one."
00:33:19.597,00:33:23.601,"I remember what she said. She said, Bunnies are sexual yet innocent."
00:33:23.668,00:33:25.603,You can talk to her about that later.
00:33:25.670,00:33:29.774,"I don't remember anything, ha, and I remember that."
00:33:30.041,00:33:30.742,Sally.
00:33:32.176,00:33:34.045,"Sally, is that a blue label?"
00:33:34.746,00:33:37.682,What? Are you using blue labels?
00:33:38.549,00:33:40.551,"-Is this a blue fucking label? -Oh, yeah."
00:33:40.618,00:33:43.521,-You're putting a blue label on my art? -Yeah.
00:33:43.588,00:33:46.424,"Yeah. What, do you think I like blue? I hate blue."
00:33:47.091,00:33:49.027,-I didn't know. -You should have known.
00:33:49.093,00:33:50.428,Do I use blue in my art?
00:33:51.796,00:33:54.332,"-Well, there-- -No, I don't, actually. Do I?"
00:33:54.399,00:33:56.467,"So, why would I want it on my fucking box?"
00:33:57.301,00:33:59.737,"People open my box, they see blue, they think of blue."
00:33:59.804,00:34:02.106,"That's a bit of a travesty, don't you think?"
00:34:02.173,00:34:04.075,"-I don't know. -Yeah, yeah. What?"
00:34:04.375,00:34:06.677,"-I don't know. -Yeah, you know. You fucking know."
00:34:06.744,00:34:14.052,"If there aren't white labels, go to the store, you walk your fucking butt out to the store and you get more white labels. You don't use blue labels."
00:34:14.118,00:34:15.319,Blue is fucking cute.
00:34:15.653,00:34:17.588,My work isn't cute. The world isn't cute.
00:34:19.390,00:34:21.125,Cute isn't truthful.
00:34:21.692,00:34:24.695,"Blue isn't truthful. Blue is fucking bullshit, Sally."
00:34:24.762,00:34:26.798,You get it? You understand?
00:34:27.698,00:34:29.267,Tell me you understand.
00:34:29.667,00:34:32.537,Do you fucking understand that blue isn't fucking cute?
00:34:34.572,00:34:36.307,-Hello? -I... I... Yes.
00:34:38.076,00:34:41.279,"Tell me you know blue isn't fucking cute, Sally!"
00:34:41.679,00:34:44.515,-I understand. I understand! -Blue is bullshit.
00:34:44.582,00:34:45.650,I get it. I'm sorry.
00:34:45.716,00:34:50.221,"Take the fucking blue label off your fucking box, and go get some white ones."
00:34:50.855,00:34:53.825,"In the meantime, take off that blue fucking shirt!"
00:34:54.425,00:34:56.127,You fucking shithead!
00:34:57.829,00:35:00.865,"I'm sorry my place is so small, Mrs. Salt."
00:35:02.300,00:35:04.635,But you can stay on the couch as long as you like.
00:35:05.169,00:35:07.738,"-Donna, call me Veronica, please. -Oh."
00:35:08.339,00:35:12.143,"If you want, you can sleep in my bed, and I can sleep on the couch."
00:35:12.210,00:35:13.344,Why would you do that?
00:35:14.345,00:35:15.880,I just feel so bad for you.
00:35:17.348,00:35:19.283,This world doesn't make sense sometimes.
00:35:19.884,00:35:23.588,"-But it's all part of God's plan. -Well, I wish he would've planned better."
00:35:31.129,00:35:32.663,I have something for you.
00:35:36.334,00:35:37.535,This is yours.
00:35:41.372,00:35:42.373,What's in here?
00:35:42.673,00:35:44.675,Pictures. Drawings.
00:35:45.409,00:35:46.277,Memories.
00:35:48.246,00:35:51.616,"You know, I'm not sure if I'm gonna open it right now."
00:35:51.682,00:35:53.484,"No, of course. I'll leave you alone."
00:35:53.551,00:35:55.586,"Oh, no, you don't have to do that. I just..."
00:35:56.420,00:35:58.189,"You know, I'm gonna open it later."
00:35:58.523,00:36:02.493,It feels like a... nice bottle of wine.
00:36:03.261,00:36:05.863,I should open it on a special occasion.
00:36:06.497,00:36:07.465,Yes.
00:36:07.932,00:36:09.200,Wine.
00:36:10.768,00:36:13.638,I like wine. I forgot.
00:36:13.704,00:36:15.339,Would you like some wine?
00:36:16.941,00:36:18.676,I could pour you a glass.
00:36:19.443,00:36:20.511,"Oh, no. That's okay."
00:36:20.578,00:36:23.481,"I'd rather just rest, if that's okay."
00:36:24.348,00:36:25.483,I'm very tired.
00:36:41.699,00:36:45.269,-Why are you doing this? -I'm being a good Christian.
00:36:46.904,00:36:50.641,"When I think about how little we paid you, it's embarrassing."
00:36:50.708,00:36:51.909,You gave me enough.
00:36:52.843,00:36:55.213,I was able to provide for my son.
00:36:56.447,00:37:00.785,-You have a son. -Yes. You know this already.
00:37:00.851,00:37:02.220,Where is he?
00:37:03.254,00:37:04.622,He's fighting.
00:37:04.689,00:37:07.291,-Is he a boxer? -He's a soldier.
00:37:07.358,00:37:10.261,"-Oh, a soldier. Right. That makes sense. -He got drafted."
00:37:12.496,00:37:13.965,"Kip got drafted, too."
00:37:14.232,00:37:17.435,No. Kip did not get drafted.
00:37:19.971,00:37:21.405,What do you mean?
00:37:23.441,00:37:24.675,He volunteered.
00:37:27.445,00:37:28.579,You're pregnant.
00:37:29.447,00:37:31.282,"Oh, my God."
00:37:31.749,00:37:33.284,Uh...
00:37:33.718,00:37:35.686,-Are you positive? -I'm positive.
00:37:35.753,00:37:37.955,"-You're eight weeks along. -Oh, my God."
00:37:38.022,00:37:40.291,I'm shaking. Is it bad to be shaking?
00:37:40.358,00:37:42.293,Is it normal to be shaking at eight weeks?
00:37:42.360,00:37:44.729,It's completely normal. You're just excited.
00:37:45.396,00:37:47.798,-It's all good. -How is it possible?
00:37:47.865,00:37:49.734,How is this possible?
00:37:49.800,00:37:52.737,It's totally possible. I'm positive.
00:37:56.574,00:37:58.276,You can kiss.
00:37:59.043,00:38:00.278,Yeah.
00:38:18.062,00:38:19.497,You sure you wanna do this?
00:38:19.930,00:38:22.733,"Donna, I'm broke. I'm not qualified to do anything else."
00:38:23.734,00:38:26.704,You don't have any rich New York friends that can get you a job?
00:38:26.771,00:38:29.540,-Isn't that how it works? -I never really had any friends.
00:38:31.409,00:38:33.377,You look very pretty in your uniform.
00:38:38.582,00:38:40.318,Do you know how to make a bed?
00:38:40.384,00:38:43.921,"Of course, Donna. What do you think I am? A moron?"
00:38:44.555,00:38:47.525,No. I just thought maybe it was beneath you.
00:38:51.028,00:38:53.464,I must have been such a jerk before.
00:38:53.531,00:38:56.500,You weren't a jerk. You had a lot of money.
00:38:56.567,00:39:00.371,And it's human nature for people to think they're above this kind of thing.
00:39:00.438,00:39:01.639,"Yeah, well."
00:39:02.573,00:39:06.344,"When you hit rock bottom, there's nothing really beneath you, is there?"
00:39:06.811,00:39:07.945,Rock?
00:39:08.012,00:39:10.414,"Yeah. Ha, ha. Rock."
00:39:14.785,00:39:16.587,Sucks. Sucks. Sucks. Sucks.
00:39:21.926,00:39:23.060,Sucks. It's just all...
00:39:27.498,00:39:29.533,"This piece sucks, too. I hate this piece."
00:39:31.068,00:39:32.603,"-Hey, Sally. -Yeah?"
00:39:33.938,00:39:37.641,I can't stand the lines. They're too thick.
00:39:37.708,00:39:41.879,I asked you to draw a nice precise line over the...
00:39:43.447,00:39:47.084,"lines that I already drew. You're my assistant, you gotta assist me."
00:39:47.151,00:39:49.620,"You gotta help me. Just a nice thin line, loosen your hand."
00:39:49.687,00:39:51.889,-Mm-hm. -Draw the line.
00:39:52.556,00:39:54.058,"Yeah, yeah. I mean, I know."
00:39:54.125,00:39:58.429,"I just thought for this one, the thicker line looked a little bit better."
00:40:00.698,00:40:02.700,Sometimes I wanna punch you in the face.
00:40:09.673,00:40:12.877,I'll do it good. I'll try-- I don't care. It sucks.
00:40:16.814,00:40:17.848,Let me try this.
00:40:24.822,00:40:26.857,"All right, Sally. Sally, bring me the pink."
00:40:26.924,00:40:28.859,Bring me the pink paint. Uh...
00:40:28.926,00:40:31.529,"Face color. Natural. You know, face."
00:40:31.595,00:40:34.031,Face. Sometimes I wanna punch you in the face.
00:40:34.098,00:40:36.734,Get over here and bring me that fucking paint!
00:40:36.801,00:40:38.969,Sometimes I wanna punch you in the face.
00:40:43.774,00:40:45.843,Sometimes I wanna punch you in the face.
00:41:08.632,00:41:09.700,Housekeeping.
00:41:14.205,00:41:15.239,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:41:15.506,00:41:19.043,"No, no, no. You can come in now. I will sit on the floor."
00:41:19.109,00:41:20.578,I won't be in your way.
00:41:20.644,00:41:22.780,That's okay. I can give you these clean towels.
00:41:22.847,00:41:26.951,"Look, I have no need for clean towels. I'm gonna pay you to come in and clean."
00:41:27.017,00:41:31.021,"I will sit on the floor. I will do my stretches, my Kegel exercises."
00:41:31.088,00:41:35.993,"I'll watch you work. You clean the room. Ha, ha."
00:41:36.193,00:41:38.229,"And, uh, I'll give you 100 dollars."
00:41:38.496,00:41:39.997,"No, that's okay. Here."
00:41:46.170,00:41:47.037,Not bad.
00:41:51.575,00:41:54.044,-What do you think? -It's really good.
00:41:54.812,00:41:56.280,It's a fucking masterpiece.
00:41:56.547,00:41:58.983,"Well, the tone in Washington right now is very somber."
00:41:59.049,00:42:01.652,We lost another 600 troops this week.
00:42:02.653,00:42:07.758,The military has responded with an onslaught of carpet bombs and bunker busters.
00:42:07.825,00:42:11.862,We're not clear how many civilian casualties have resulted from the campaign but...
00:42:12.663,00:42:14.298,does it really matter?
00:42:14.565,00:42:16.267,Let's bring out the fart machine.
00:42:26.710,00:42:29.213,"-I spoke to my son today. -Oh, that's nice."
00:42:29.280,00:42:31.615,He's getting a month leave from the war.
00:42:31.682,00:42:32.883,"Oh, that's wonderful."
00:42:35.219,00:42:36.620,You must worry about him.
00:42:37.955,00:42:39.023,Always.
00:42:40.291,00:42:43.894,"I don't know what it's like over there, but I imagine the worst."
00:42:43.961,00:42:46.997,"Well, no one seems to be taking it seriously over here."
00:42:47.865,00:42:49.733,I think people are taking it seriously.
00:42:49.800,00:42:52.570,"What, with the fart machine? That's all everyone watches."
00:42:52.937,00:42:55.105,"Well, it's good to laugh."
00:42:56.240,00:42:58.876,Do you think people are laughing in the Middle East?
00:43:00.744,00:43:02.012,This is a war on terror.
00:43:03.013,00:43:05.015,"What does that even mean, Donna?"
00:43:06.050,00:43:09.153,There is no war on terror. It's not even real.
00:43:09.987,00:43:12.623,Do you know what I was doing during the war on drugs?
00:43:13.223,00:43:14.224,Getting stoned.
00:43:18.329,00:43:20.030,You dishonor your son.
00:43:23.801,00:43:25.769,"-It's weird. -No, it's not."
00:43:25.836,00:43:27.905,"It is so weird, I'm telling you."
00:43:27.972,00:43:29.206,I'm just practicing.
00:43:29.273,00:43:31.875,"The more prepared we are, the better parents we'll be."
00:43:31.942,00:43:35.179,-It's creepy as fuck. -Don't swear in front of the baby.
00:43:35.245,00:43:36.380,Would you stop?
00:43:36.647,00:43:39.984,The baby doesn't even have ears. It's probably gonna be born without ears.
00:43:40.050,00:43:43.320,-I wish you'd stop saying that. -I think you're being too premature.
00:43:43.387,00:43:45.623,-You're being immature. -Immature? Really?
00:43:45.689,00:43:49.093,"-You're walking around with a fake baby. -I'm excited, Ashley!"
00:43:49.159,00:43:51.295,It's just that you're being unrealistic.
00:43:51.962,00:43:54.398,"Honey, you're making all these preparations."
00:43:54.665,00:43:58.302,What happens if the baby falls through? Then we've got all this crap that just...
00:43:58.369,00:44:01.238,"I don't know, reminds us of the one that got away."
00:44:04.174,00:44:10.114,"When the baby comes, she's gonna be beautiful and healthy."
00:44:10.180,00:44:14.652,Even if she has two heads and no ears. I don't care.
00:44:16.220,00:44:17.655,What if it's a he?
00:44:19.390,00:44:22.893,Then he'll be an idiot like all the rest.
00:44:23.360,00:44:25.162,But we'll love him all the same.
00:44:28.766,00:44:30.968,"-Mommy's just scared. -Oh, creepy."
00:45:06.336,00:45:08.072,"Oh, my goodness."
00:45:08.138,00:45:10.707,"It's so cute. Thank you, Rose."
00:45:12.910,00:45:15.979,But it says 10 percent polyester.
00:45:17.047,00:45:19.049,A baby's skin can't touch polyester.
00:45:20.384,00:45:21.418,I'm so sorry.
00:45:22.453,00:45:24.354,It's so cute though. Thank you.
00:45:24.421,00:45:27.224,I put the gift receipt in the bag.
00:45:27.291,00:45:28.492,"Oh, great. I'll return it."
00:45:37.167,00:45:39.136,"It teaches you to crawl, the baby to crawl."
00:45:39.203,00:45:46.110,"-Where did you get it? -This summer, when Doug and I were traveling, in the tiniest cutest little shop, this artist makes everything by hand."
00:45:50.214,00:45:52.449,Yeah. That's where I got it.
00:45:52.516,00:45:55.085,Rachel. China? Ah!
00:45:55.419,00:45:59.289,We have terrible standards here. But China? There's like no standards.
00:45:59.356,00:46:03.494,"Oh, honey. This is a renowned artist. You have nothing to worry about."
00:46:03.760,00:46:07.397,"Well, I'm sure he doesn't know anything about not using lead paint."
00:46:07.464,00:46:09.099,Who knows what's in this thing?
00:46:09.166,00:46:12.436,-It was really expensive. -So is getting your stomach pumped.
00:46:19.810,00:46:21.111,"Thanks, Christie."
00:46:24.781,00:46:27.217,"-Oh, what's this? -It's a baby monitor."
00:46:27.284,00:46:31.021,"If you're outside or in the other room, you can hear him crying or..."
00:46:32.289,00:46:33.957,But it says Wi-Fi.
00:46:35.125,00:46:38.362,-Yeah. -I don't trust Wi-Fi around the baby.
00:46:38.962,00:46:44.368,"All those electronic signals, it's not good for the little baby's developing brain."
00:46:44.434,00:46:51.241,"I'm pretty sure it's safe, Lisa. They wouldn't release it to the public-- Look at all the things they release to the public."
00:46:51.308,00:46:54.845,"I actually used one when I had Sam, and it's fine."
00:46:54.912,00:46:56.213,"Yeah, you need one."
00:46:56.280,00:46:58.515,-A lot of them are wireless. Yeah. -Yeah.
00:46:59.149,00:47:00.317,Um...
00:47:00.951,00:47:04.488,Didn't you say that Sam didn't do very well in first grade?
00:47:04.555,00:47:06.256,That they almost held him back?
00:47:06.323,00:47:09.193,He just wasn't ready to be around children at that time.
00:47:10.294,00:47:18.569,"Well, maybe if he hadn't been exposed to Wi-Fi at such an early age, maybe he would have done better."
00:47:33.250,00:47:35.018,-Excuse me. Excuse me. -Yes?
00:47:35.085,00:47:37.054,Do you clean the rooms on this floor?
00:47:37.421,00:47:39.890,-Yes. -Did you take that out of my room?
00:47:40.290,00:47:42.326,-What? -The magazine in your pocket.
00:47:42.392,00:47:44.094,"-This is my magazine. -No, it's not."
00:47:44.161,00:47:46.496,I am in room 412. Did you clean room 412?
00:47:46.563,00:47:53.136,I manage the housekeepers on this floor. The ones who clean the rooms are Mexicans.
00:47:53.203,00:47:54.871,-You bought this? -Of course I did.
00:47:54.938,00:47:56.907,"-What, are you an art collector? -Maybe."
00:47:56.974,00:47:59.076,"This is my magazine. Yeah, yeah."
00:47:59.142,00:48:00.911,You see this circle?
00:48:00.978,00:48:02.479,I circled that quote.
00:48:03.146,00:48:07.284,-Really? Why did you do that? -Because she speaks to me 'cause she's a fucking genius.
00:48:07.351,00:48:10.454,"Well, I don't think she's a genius. My son draws better than her."
00:48:10.520,00:48:13.490,-I wonder what else you stole. -It's just a magazine.
00:48:13.557,00:48:16.260,"If you're staying here, you can afford another one."
00:48:16.326,00:48:19.529,"Well, that doesn't entitle you -to take what's mine. -No."
00:48:20.030,00:48:21.265,I'm not entitled.
00:48:21.932,00:48:24.568,-You are the entitled one. -Why? 'Cause I'm rich?
00:48:25.202,00:48:26.603,-'Cause I'm white? -No.
00:48:27.404,00:48:28.572,Because you're a dick.
00:48:32.342,00:48:33.644,Put it here for one second.
00:48:33.910,00:48:36.179,Let me see it. I need yellow next to the debris.
00:48:36.246,00:48:38.248,"If there's one here, a little bit smaller."
00:48:38.315,00:48:39.516,-Ashley. -Yes.
00:48:40.284,00:48:43.086,Indie Art Magazine is here. They wanna interview you.
00:48:43.153,00:48:44.488,"Indie Art. Ha, ha."
00:48:44.554,00:48:47.057,They never wanted to interview me. Now they're here.
00:48:47.124,00:48:48.659,Tell them to go fuck themselves.
00:48:48.925,00:48:51.361,"I'm kidding. Of course, I'm kidding."
00:48:51.428,00:48:53.230,"Would you bring them in, please?"
00:48:53.463,00:48:57.934,"The pressure, you guys. I can't believe I've been under a rock for so long."
00:48:58.001,00:49:01.438,So misunderstood and fucking ignored.
00:49:01.505,00:49:03.240,"Okay, I, uh..."
00:49:03.307,00:49:04.174,Ashley.
00:49:04.241,00:49:08.578,Leave that wall for a second and let's come over here -and start looking at some. -Ashley.
00:49:12.149,00:49:13.016,Hi.
00:49:13.350,00:49:14.351,Frederick. Indie Art.
00:49:14.418,00:49:16.553,-I'm Ashley. So nice to meet you. -How are you?
00:49:17.154,00:49:18.622,-Let's get right to it. -Okay.
00:49:19.656,00:49:20.524,Ah!
00:49:24.261,00:49:25.962,"-I'm home. -Oh, look at you."
00:49:26.363,00:49:27.431,All in one piece.
00:49:28.298,00:49:30.100,It must be so dangerous over there.
00:49:31.301,00:49:32.169,It is.
00:49:33.203,00:49:34.137,It's supposed to be.
00:49:36.506,00:49:37.674,They should respect us.
00:49:38.375,00:49:41.578,They'll be more respectful of us when we're more respectful of them.
00:49:42.079,00:49:45.248,"Well, when someone's pointing a gun at you, what choice do you have?"
00:49:45.315,00:49:47.351,-What do you mean? -You have to respect them.
00:49:51.588,00:49:53.390,"So, my mom used to work for you?"
00:49:55.525,00:49:56.526,Yeah.
00:49:59.162,00:50:01.431,And exactly how long do you plan on staying here?
00:50:01.498,00:50:04.334,"She'll be going to her aunt's in a few days, right?"
00:50:05.469,00:50:07.571,-Yes. -You bought that bus ticket already?
00:50:10.073,00:50:10.741,Yes.
00:50:14.177,00:50:17.114,What are you doing?
00:50:17.781,00:50:21.051,I'm painting these walls. There's no way we're keeping these red.
00:50:21.118,00:50:23.120,"-Well, why not? -Why do you think?"
00:50:23.653,00:50:28.258,"Can we just wait until the baby's born, and then decide whether or not we wanna change the walls?"
00:50:28.325,00:50:31.428,"No, because this red reminds me of a miscarriage."
00:50:31.495,00:50:34.598,"-Is that what you want? Miscarriage red? -Yeah. Oh, is that a color?"
00:50:34.664,00:50:36.666,That's what I want. I want miscarriage red.
00:50:36.733,00:50:39.336,-I hate these walls! -Since when?
00:50:39.403,00:50:41.705,Since always! They freak me out!
00:50:41.772,00:50:43.407,"Oh, you know what freaks me out?"
00:50:43.473,00:50:45.742,You obsessing over a baby that isn't even born yet.
00:50:45.809,00:50:50.180,"Every time you have this on your chest, -it makes me wanna jump out a window. -What?"
00:50:50.247,00:50:52.816,-This is a fake baby! It's a fake baby. -It's my baby!
00:50:53.083,00:50:54.718,-Give me my baby! -This is a fake baby.
00:50:54.785,00:50:56.820,-Let go of the baby! -It's a fake baby!
00:50:57.087,00:50:59.823,-Let go of the baby! It's not a fake baby! -It is a fake baby!
00:51:00.090,00:51:03.393,-It's a fake baby! -It's my baby!
00:51:03.460,00:51:04.694,Give me my baby.
00:51:08.331,00:51:10.267,I hate you. She didn't mean it.
00:51:16.473,00:51:17.340,Thank you.
00:51:18.675,00:51:21.545,And how many nights are you gonna be staying?
00:51:22.312,00:51:23.680,-A couple. -Yeah?
00:51:24.147,00:51:25.549,And where are you visiting from?
00:51:26.216,00:51:27.083,Nowhere.
00:51:27.717,00:51:29.719,-What's that? -Nowhere.
00:51:31.655,00:51:32.622,Did you say nowhere?
00:51:33.557,00:51:35.692,"Yeah. I just said, nowhere. What are you, deaf?"
00:51:38.562,00:51:39.429,Yeah. I...
00:51:40.664,00:51:41.631,"I am, actually."
00:51:41.698,00:51:48.672,I lost 80 percent of my hearing when I was a teenager because my dad wasn't a very nice man.
00:51:49.706,00:51:51.141,-Oh... -Um...
00:51:53.243,00:51:54.144,Here are your keys.
00:51:55.412,00:51:57.280,-Room 12. -I didn't know.
00:51:57.581,00:51:58.482,Have a great night.
00:52:00.484,00:52:02.686,I also have psoriasis. Ahem.
00:52:02.752,00:52:04.387,All along the inside of my thigh.
00:52:05.322,00:52:07.791,"So, if you wanna make fun of that, too."
00:52:07.858,00:52:08.725,No.
00:52:09.693,00:52:12.662,And I have ringworm.
00:52:13.830,00:52:14.698,On my genitals.
00:52:16.166,00:52:16.833,Ringworm.
00:52:18.768,00:52:21.338,"-You ever heard of ring around the collar? -Uh, yup."
00:52:21.872,00:52:24.341,-I have ring around the scrotum. -Okay. Okay.
00:52:24.641,00:52:27.210,Just try to be nicer to people.
00:53:24.968,00:53:25.835,"Hi, Mom."
00:53:26.469,00:53:28.605,"It's, uh, me. Ha."
00:53:29.873,00:53:32.342,You've been asleep now for about six months.
00:53:33.810,00:53:41.851,"I don't know what happened the night you fell down the stairs, but... I have been thinking a lot about my life since then."
00:53:43.386,00:53:48.458,"And I got accepted into art school, but I'm enlisting in the war effort instead."
00:53:49.593,00:53:51.628,I'm shipping off to the Middle East tomorrow.
00:53:52.629,00:54:03.006,"I thought about what you said about making a difference, and I think I can make more of a difference making peace over there than making art over here."
00:54:03.974,00:54:06.743,"So... I love you, Mom."
00:54:06.943,00:54:07.844,And I...
00:54:08.678,00:54:11.481,I will see you when I get back.
00:54:47.050,00:54:48.752,"Uh, hey. Have you seen Lisa?"
00:54:49.352,00:54:51.721,"-Oh, no. -Where the fuck is she? Is she coming?"
00:54:51.788,00:54:52.956,"Lisa, where are you?"
00:54:53.823,00:54:55.458,Really? You're not gonna show up?
00:54:59.963,00:55:01.431,Shit.
00:55:01.731,00:55:03.700,Shit. Shit.
00:55:03.767,00:55:05.902,Shit. Shit.
00:55:05.969,00:55:06.870,Shit.
00:55:07.003,00:55:08.538,Shit. Shit.
00:55:09.439,00:55:10.940,Shit. Shit.
00:55:11.608,00:55:13.410,Shit. Shit.
00:55:13.877,00:55:14.778,Shit.
00:55:14.844,00:55:15.779,Shit.
00:55:15.845,00:55:16.713,Shit.
00:55:17.013,00:55:18.815,Shit. Shit.
00:55:19.449,00:55:20.316,Shit.
00:55:20.383,00:55:21.418,Shit.
00:55:21.484,00:55:22.419,Shit.
00:55:22.485,00:55:23.520,Shit.
00:55:23.586,00:55:25.522,Shit. Shit.
00:55:25.755,00:55:27.357,-Shit. -It's brilliant.
00:55:31.628,00:55:33.697,"It's, uh, radiant, really."
00:55:33.763,00:55:37.600,"Radiant? Now, come on. Nobody's ever said that about my work."
00:55:38.501,00:55:42.605,"It really is, Ashley. And you're radiant, and you're positively glowing."
00:55:44.774,00:55:45.875,Oh...
00:55:46.609,00:55:48.945,"Maybe there's a reason. I don't know. Ha, ha."
00:55:50.814,00:55:52.982,Why don't you tell me about that one over there?
00:55:53.049,00:55:56.686,-Sure. Yeah. Which? Um... -This one right here.
00:55:57.120,00:55:59.689,I haven't seen all the work.
00:55:59.756,00:56:02.792,-Yeah. -But I just gravitate to this one.
00:56:02.859,00:56:04.094,Yeah. One of my favorites.
00:56:04.360,00:56:09.866,"-Ahem. I'm thinking about buying it. -Oh, it's not for s-- I don't know if I'm gonna sell it, actually."
00:56:09.933,00:56:13.369,"Well, you know, every painting has a price."
00:56:13.436,00:56:16.606,Okay. Well-- Okay. We can talk about it later.
00:56:17.507,00:56:18.675,What inspired it?
00:56:20.543,00:56:22.545,Sometimes people just need their ass kicked.
00:57:23.506,00:57:28.678,It's like the celebration of life. It's-- I mean-- Or the human spirit.
00:57:28.745,00:57:35.752,"I mean, in order to create, you have to destroy the worn-out paradigms that prohibit progress."
00:57:35.819,00:57:38.154,"You know, that's what this is about. This is about..."
00:57:38.855,00:57:40.190,This is what art is for.
00:57:40.457,00:57:43.760,This is about changing the world. Heh.
00:57:43.827,00:57:45.762,That's what this is to me.
00:57:45.995,00:57:47.564,"I mean, hopefully that'll fit."
00:57:50.166,00:57:51.468,That would be tough.
00:57:51.968,00:57:56.206,"Because it is. It's like, this is art. I mean, art is about changing the world."
00:57:56.473,00:57:57.807,You're a hack.
00:57:59.476,00:58:00.143,Bullshit.
00:58:03.680,00:58:06.549,"-Veronica? -In the flesh, baby cakes."
00:58:06.616,00:58:07.484,In the flesh.
00:58:10.053,00:58:11.154,Knock it off!
00:58:23.633,00:58:25.502,Get out of my way. Get out of my way!
00:58:26.769,00:58:27.670,This is mine.
00:58:28.071,00:58:29.639,This is mine!
00:58:29.906,00:58:31.641,This is mine!
00:58:34.644,00:58:35.512,Fuck!
00:58:35.945,00:58:36.980,Fuck!
00:58:43.720,00:58:44.587,Brilliant.
00:59:16.886,00:59:19.989,Hey! Huh? Huh?
00:59:20.757,00:59:21.658,How about this?
00:59:32.635,00:59:33.303,Get up!
01:00:13.376,01:00:14.344,"Oh, God."
01:00:23.219,01:00:24.821,That's all you fucking got?
01:00:27.790,01:00:28.992,Fuck you!
01:00:53.916,01:00:54.884,"Oh, yeah."
01:00:56.786,01:00:57.887,"Oh, yeah."
01:01:10.667,01:01:11.334,Fuck you.
01:01:14.170,01:01:15.171,You want another one?
01:04:12.882,01:04:14.050,"Well, it's official."
01:04:14.317,01:04:16.485,The war on terror is over.
01:04:17.954,01:04:19.422,"Yes, incredibly, the draft worked."
01:04:19.488,01:04:25.027,Committing millions of troops in the Middle East gave us the competitive edge we needed to take control and conquer.
01:04:25.094,01:04:29.265,"And as a result, Western culture is spreading like kudzu."
01:04:30.099,01:04:34.203,People in the Middle East are watching Netflix. They're using social media.
01:04:34.871,01:04:37.874,They're eating fast food. They're even dropping acid.
01:04:38.107,01:04:40.142,And not the kind you throw in people's faces.
01:04:42.345,01:04:48.584,"Americans are saying that, for the first time since 9/11, they feel a real sense of ease and comfort."
01:04:49.585,01:04:54.123,"In fact, Homeland Security has once again updated its color-coded warning system."
01:04:54.190,01:04:55.057,Let's take a look.
01:04:55.424,01:04:58.227,"As you can see, the new status levels are safe..."
01:04:58.294,01:05:01.898,"-Oh, my goodness. Doctor! -...incredibly safe, -unbelievably safe... -Doctor!"
01:05:01.964,01:05:03.499,...and not a fucking care in the world.
01:05:05.902,01:05:07.370,My name is Dr. Jones.
01:05:07.436,01:05:10.006,I'm the comatose doctor at Mercy General.
01:05:10.072,01:05:11.274,The comatose doctor?
01:05:11.340,01:05:14.477,"Yes, I specialize in comatose patients here at the hospital."
01:05:14.543,01:05:18.180,"-Okay. -I know this is gonna come as a bit of a shock, Miss Miller."
01:05:20.616,01:05:23.252,-What? -You've been in a coma for two years.
01:05:23.319,01:05:24.320,I don't understand.
01:05:24.387,01:05:25.688,You've been in a coma for two years.
01:05:26.689,01:05:27.556,If you'll excuse me.
01:05:27.623,01:05:29.091,Wait. Where are you going?
01:05:29.525,01:05:33.562,"I'll come back later when I have more time, but congratulations are in order."
01:05:33.629,01:05:35.031,Congratulations?
01:05:35.097,01:05:40.503,"We were planning on removing your breathing tube, so it was a good thing that you woke up when you did."
01:05:40.569,01:05:41.470,My breathing tube?
01:05:41.537,01:05:43.706,"Yes, we were using a breathing tube on you."
01:05:43.973,01:05:45.474,-Why? -To help you breathe.
01:05:45.541,01:05:49.045,"But if you were removing it, then, that means that..."
01:05:49.111,01:05:51.614,-You wouldn't be able to breathe. -Why would you do that?
01:05:51.681,01:05:52.949,You're out of money.
01:05:53.015,01:05:55.284,-I'm terribly sorry. I've got the runs. -What?
01:05:55.351,01:05:57.153,"I mean, I've got to run. Excuse me."
01:06:02.224,01:06:04.627,"Oh, no, no. This is not a joke."
01:06:04.694,01:06:07.263,-Why were you laughing? -'Cause the doctor farted.
01:06:07.330,01:06:09.632,Where is Lisa? Why isn't she here?
01:06:09.699,01:06:11.434,"Ashley, listen. You're in shock."
01:06:11.500,01:06:14.036,Why did he say that I didn't have any money?
01:06:14.303,01:06:17.406,"Well, you've been in the hospital for two years. That's expensive."
01:06:17.473,01:06:19.041,But I have insurance.
01:06:19.108,01:06:22.211,"Oh, you have to renew your insurance every year now and you didn't."
01:06:22.278,01:06:23.746,But why didn't I do it?
01:06:24.413,01:06:27.383,"-Uh, well, you were in a coma. -But I would still have money."
01:06:28.050,01:06:29.051,No.
01:06:29.185,01:06:30.353,You lost everything.
01:06:30.419,01:06:32.088,"Wait, what about Lisa?"
01:06:32.154,01:06:33.756,Where are my paintings?
01:06:34.023,01:06:36.759,Lisa sold your paintings to pay for the hospital bills.
01:06:37.193,01:06:38.594,And then where did she go?
01:06:39.462,01:06:40.329,Oh...
01:06:44.200,01:06:45.468,Where did my baby go?
01:06:50.773,01:06:51.640,My baby.
01:06:53.743,01:06:55.077,I'm sorry.
01:06:57.413,01:06:58.547,This can't be happening.
01:07:00.549,01:07:03.419,"Oh, please, tell me this isn't happening. Just hold my hand."
01:07:03.753,01:07:04.620,Okay.
01:07:05.488,01:07:09.592,You just stood by me all these years. That's so nice.
01:07:10.259,01:07:15.031,"-Yeah, that's actually not true. -What do you mean?"
01:07:16.098,01:07:20.136,I was just dropping off a box of my comic books to the children's ward.
01:07:20.202,01:07:25.674,"And I was walking by this room, and I saw you there, and I thought, Oh, yeah, Ashley's here. I'll stop by."
01:07:25.741,01:07:27.576,And that's when you woke up.
01:07:32.214,01:07:34.383,Wait. You wrote a comic book.
01:07:35.384,01:07:36.285,Yeah.
01:07:36.652,01:07:38.220,Can you believe it?
01:07:46.328,01:07:48.264,It's a big success.
01:07:48.631,01:07:51.667,People all over the world are reading it.
01:07:52.802,01:07:55.738,They're even adapting it into a Hollywood movie.
01:07:55.805,01:08:00.476,"You know, Ron Howard wants to direct it, but I really want David Lynch."
01:08:16.392,01:08:18.127,Veronica!
01:08:19.462,01:08:21.130,Veronica!
01:08:22.331,01:08:23.566,Veronica!
01:08:24.366,01:08:25.568,"Hey, I'm here."
01:08:25.634,01:08:26.502,Are they here?
01:08:27.236,01:08:30.206,"-No, Aunt Charlie. Not yet. -They're coming. I can feel it."
01:08:30.473,01:08:31.340,I know.
01:08:32.274,01:08:38.781,"The tentacles are gonna rise up from the earth, and they're going to destroy all the wretched souls in this place."
01:08:38.848,01:08:41.517,"I know, Aunt Charlie, but the tentacles aren't here yet."
01:08:43.552,01:08:47.256,"If I go before they come, you know what you're supposed to do, Veronica."
01:08:47.323,01:08:48.190,I know.
01:08:48.891,01:08:49.859,"Tell me, so I know."
01:08:51.627,01:08:53.295,I'm gonna bury you in the garden.
01:08:53.662,01:08:55.297,-Bury me in the garden. -I will.
01:08:55.498,01:08:57.199,"That way, Gaia can consume me."
01:08:57.466,01:09:01.770,"And then, I'll be recycled into the earth, when I can be born again as something else."
01:09:02.471,01:09:04.306,"Oh, yes. Our good friend Gaia."
01:09:04.373,01:09:05.508,The tentacles are coming.
01:09:06.509,01:09:07.376,They're coming.
01:09:13.382,01:09:16.752,"See, you're doing great. Just put one foot in front of the other."
01:09:16.819,01:09:19.688,"Oh, is that how you walk? Put one foot in front of the other."
01:09:19.755,01:09:21.924,You remind me of someone who used to be here.
01:09:22.191,01:09:24.560,"Oh, my legs feel like linguine."
01:09:26.896,01:09:28.164,You're doing great.
01:09:28.230,01:09:29.632,-This is great. -Okay.
01:09:30.299,01:09:32.768,"All right, just a little-- -Um... -That's enough."
01:09:33.235,01:09:35.337,"-Okay, you can't quit. -I'm not quitting."
01:09:36.205,01:09:39.241,"-I'll do it again tomorrow. -You won't be here tomorrow, Ashley."
01:09:39.308,01:09:42.444,-We've gotta get you walking out today. -What are you--? Why?
01:09:42.511,01:09:44.914,"Because this is a for-profit hospital, not a charity."
01:10:18.414,01:10:19.281,"Hey, Mom."
01:10:19.615,01:10:20.482,It's me.
01:10:21.417,01:10:23.419,"And, um, I started drawing again."
01:10:23.819,01:10:25.721,I do think creativity is important.
01:10:26.889,01:10:31.227,"There's a lot of artists in this town, and I love it here."
01:10:34.296,01:10:35.698,"Wow, this is a nice place."
01:10:36.599,01:10:38.934,"Yeah, it's pretty small."
01:10:39.702,01:10:41.904,I'm thinking of buying a place in Bushwick.
01:10:41.971,01:10:42.838,Yeah?
01:10:44.240,01:10:46.375,"You make that much money on a comic book, huh?"
01:10:46.642,01:10:48.911,"Well, yeah. I mean, I sold the rights to Hollywood."
01:10:48.978,01:10:51.013,Heh. I got really lucky.
01:10:53.983,01:10:56.819,I appreciate you letting me stay here.
01:10:58.854,01:11:00.923,I feel so bad about what happened to you.
01:11:01.991,01:11:05.828,"But you can paint in my studio, and you'll be back on your feet in no time."
01:11:05.894,01:11:08.430,What? Do--? But you have a studio?
01:11:08.497,01:11:11.000,"Yeah, it's the same studio that you used."
01:11:13.936,01:11:14.870,Huh.
01:11:16.305,01:11:17.473,Do you want some water?
01:11:18.807,01:11:21.277,"-Do you want something to eat? -No. No, thanks. No."
01:11:21.710,01:11:23.646,-Do you want some milk? -I'm good.
01:11:24.780,01:11:27.383,-Do you want a cheese sandwich? -I want a little sleep.
01:11:52.675,01:11:53.942,This is Sam.
01:11:55.010,01:11:57.579,"-You name your tree? -Yeah, of course."
01:11:58.047,01:11:59.848,"This is Veronica, my niece."
01:12:00.883,01:12:02.017,Say hello to Sam.
01:12:03.686,01:12:04.687,"Hello, Sam."
01:12:07.690,01:12:09.958,"Oh, you're so beautiful."
01:12:10.025,01:12:11.760,Isn't it a beautiful day?
01:12:15.564,01:12:16.598,He's a good tree.
01:12:17.633,01:12:19.501,"That's Bernie, he's an oak."
01:12:19.935,01:12:21.937,Sweet and grounded.
01:12:22.671,01:12:23.539,That's Hillary.
01:12:23.906,01:12:26.909,Strong but a little untrustworthy.
01:12:28.077,01:12:31.413,"Ah, that's Donald. He's an asshole."
01:13:02.010,01:13:04.446,You just need to ease your way back into it.
01:13:05.414,01:13:06.081,Yep.
01:13:06.849,01:13:09.118,You could help me draw my comic in the meantime.
01:13:09.385,01:13:12.054,"Oh, I don't think so. I don't think I could do that. I mean..."
01:13:12.121,01:13:14.990,-Sure you could. -Your line work is really...
01:13:16.825,01:13:18.994,precise. I don't think I could do that anymore.
01:13:19.061,01:13:20.462,There's no mustard in this.
01:13:24.633,01:13:26.402,Aww. They forgot the mustard?
01:13:26.468,01:13:28.904,I don't like to eat turkey without mustard.
01:13:30.406,01:13:33.475,"In my comic book, the happy blue bunnies love mustard."
01:13:33.542,01:13:36.945,That's a-- That's-- That's so cute.
01:13:37.613,01:13:39.681,Did you get a chance to read it yet?
01:13:40.716,01:13:46.021,Oh... Uh-- I-- I want to so bad.
01:13:46.922,01:13:48.924,"Ashley, will you do me a favor?"
01:13:50.993,01:13:52.928,Will you run out and get me some mustard?
01:14:00.769,01:14:01.637,Aunt Charlie?
01:14:03.772,01:14:04.773,It's time to wake up.
01:14:08.744,01:14:09.611,Charlie?
01:14:14.216,01:14:15.117,"Charlie, get up."
01:14:17.853,01:14:18.720,Wake up. Wake up.
01:14:21.223,01:14:22.858,You can sleep through anything.
01:14:22.925,01:14:24.660,Why do you do that? It's so jarring.
01:14:24.726,01:14:27.729,"You were lying so still, I wanted to make sure you weren't dead."
01:14:28.096,01:14:29.498,Of course my body is still.
01:14:29.565,01:14:32.201,What do you expect me to do when I'm sleeping? Calisthenics?
01:14:32.701,01:14:34.603,"Well, it's a beautiful day."
01:14:35.838,01:14:36.939,We should go outside.
01:14:37.606,01:14:39.208,Rest is good for the body.
01:14:41.243,01:14:44.880,"-What are you trying to do, kill me? -Of course not, Aunt Charlie. I just..."
01:14:44.947,01:14:48.217,Then why are you trying to get me up? I'm trying to sleep.
01:14:50.986,01:14:53.489,It's just that I realized today is Kip's birthday.
01:15:14.610,01:15:16.678,Can you get me a seltzer when you're out?
01:15:16.745,01:15:17.613,Can I get--?
01:15:18.680,01:15:19.581,Fuck.
01:15:21.183,01:15:23.585,Fucking seltzer.
01:15:23.652,01:15:24.753,Fucking shit.
01:15:26.989,01:15:27.856,Shit.
01:15:34.630,01:15:36.164,Wow. Heh.
01:15:37.299,01:15:39.935,-Sally told me you were here. -I can't believe it.
01:15:40.002,01:15:41.169,I can't believe it's you.
01:15:43.672,01:15:44.540,Um...
01:15:46.041,01:15:47.009,Wow.
01:15:49.211,01:15:50.078,Is that yours?
01:15:50.979,01:15:54.583,"He is, yeah. He is. His name's Ben."
01:15:56.184,01:15:57.052,"Hey, Ben."
01:15:59.688,01:16:03.292,"Wow, he's really, really beautiful baby."
01:16:04.560,01:16:05.227,Whoo.
01:16:05.994,01:16:07.262,"I'm sorry, Ashley."
01:16:11.133,01:16:13.902,I didn't know if you were ever gonna wake up.
01:16:13.969,01:16:15.771,"Yeah. Yeah, I know."
01:16:16.772,01:16:19.775,I didn't have any money and I still don't have any money but...
01:16:20.842,01:16:21.910,I met someone.
01:16:21.977,01:16:23.946,"Oh, good, good, that's good."
01:16:26.148,01:16:27.783,"So, what's--? What she like?"
01:16:29.651,01:16:30.752,He's nice.
01:16:31.653,01:16:32.754,Oh...
01:16:36.625,01:16:39.161,"Yeah, I know. You wanna go home, I know."
01:16:40.028,01:16:42.898,-What is it? -It's just some things I saved.
01:16:47.603,01:16:49.137,"Anyway, it was nice to see you."
01:16:54.042,01:16:55.711,I'm glad you're okay.
01:17:10.125,01:17:10.993,Fuck.
01:17:14.162,01:17:15.631,Why the hell did he join?
01:17:18.734,01:17:20.402,He believed he was making a difference.
01:17:21.236,01:17:26.775,So naive. They think they're fighting for a cause and they're really fighting for the defense industry.
01:17:26.842,01:17:29.077,"Young people, they're so stupid."
01:17:29.144,01:17:30.712,"Oh, my God, I love this one."
01:17:33.949,01:17:35.384,His glasses.
01:17:36.051,01:17:40.422,"We live in a society that doesn't value life, the earth."
01:17:41.223,01:17:42.090,Just money.
01:17:43.125,01:17:44.159,Adults are so stupid.
01:17:44.226,01:17:49.898,"Okay, if the young people are stupid and the adults are stupid, who are we supposed to turn to? The babies?"
01:17:50.365,01:17:53.702,"-Yes, the babies! Exactly! -You're not serious."
01:17:54.703,01:17:56.271,"Of course, you're serious."
01:17:56.738,01:18:03.712,"You know why? Because babies, as soon as they're conceived, all they are concerned with is life."
01:18:04.346,01:18:06.415,"Like the earth, like kudzu."
01:18:07.149,01:18:09.685,"Developing, growing."
01:18:09.751,01:18:10.986,Kudzu is a parasite.
01:18:12.754,01:18:13.789,Ashley.
01:18:18.860,01:18:20.128,Ashley.
01:18:21.296,01:18:22.998,Wake up. It's time to wake up.
01:18:23.065,01:18:25.333,Can I just--? Can I just sleep a little bit longer?
01:18:26.201,01:18:29.471,But you've been sleeping so much. I'm getting worried about you.
01:18:29.738,01:18:32.307,"No, no, no. I'm just tired, that's all."
01:18:33.241,01:18:35.277,-Do you wanna go to my bed and sleep? -No.
01:18:36.712,01:18:38.780,I don't know. Why? Am I in the way?
01:18:38.847,01:18:41.016,"No, no, you're not."
01:18:44.152,01:18:47.456,"But I have to go to the studio, so..."
01:18:47.723,01:18:49.224,"Well, I have a lot of work to do."
01:18:49.458,01:18:52.027,Um... But I'll see you when I get back.
01:18:54.129,01:18:54.996,Sally.
01:18:55.464,01:18:56.331,Yeah.
01:18:58.834,01:19:00.402,I'm sorry for how I treated you.
01:19:01.737,01:19:02.738,Oh.
01:19:03.071,01:19:04.506,You don't need to apologize.
01:19:06.308,01:19:08.210,"No, I was a real bitch."
01:19:10.178,01:19:11.313,"Well, sometimes."
01:19:11.379,01:19:14.116,But it actually motivated me.
01:19:15.350,01:19:21.523,"-Really? -Yeah. I mean, humiliation can cripple some people but it made me work harder."
01:19:24.092,01:19:25.761,"So, you didn't hate me."
01:19:26.828,01:19:28.363,Heh. Of course.
01:19:29.097,01:19:33.969,"But sometimes, the best revenge is success."
01:19:34.803,01:19:36.238,"So, why are you helping me then?"
01:19:41.209,01:19:44.146,I'm taking great joy in seeing you like this.
01:19:44.813,01:19:47.015,"I mean, your life is over."
01:19:47.082,01:19:48.116,You can't paint.
01:19:48.183,01:19:49.785,You lost your girlfriend.
01:19:49.851,01:19:51.219,You lost your baby.
01:20:12.107,01:20:12.974,Yeah.
01:20:20.382,01:20:21.449,Fucking bunny.
01:22:06.588,01:22:07.956,What are you doing here?
01:22:09.557,01:22:11.426,We have some unfinished business.
01:22:12.594,01:22:13.695,That's so dramatic.
01:22:15.230,01:22:18.133,-I lost everything because of you. -That's even more dramatic.
01:22:18.199,01:22:19.134,It's true.
01:22:22.570,01:22:26.274,-I lost everything because of you. -It looks like you're doing okay now.
01:22:32.981,01:22:35.183,You want a glass of water? You look dehydrated.
01:22:35.250,01:22:37.085,"I didn't come to make peace, Veronica."
01:22:39.254,01:22:40.188,How did you find me?
01:22:40.655,01:22:42.557,-Instinct. -I'm not buying it.
01:22:42.624,01:22:43.625,I followed your smell.
01:22:43.692,01:22:46.995,-I'm still not buying it. -I found your ticket from two years ago.
01:22:49.130,01:22:49.998,I'll buy that.
01:22:59.607,01:23:02.210,"-We don't have to do this, Ashley. -My spirit's broken."
01:23:03.712,01:23:05.313,My heart is filled with hate.
01:23:08.049,01:23:10.485,I have nothing left to do in this life but destroy you.
01:23:13.288,01:23:16.358,"Well, why don't you come in and I'll make you some breakfast first."
01:23:18.259,01:23:19.260,I haven't eaten.
01:23:22.130,01:23:23.565,Come on. I'll make you an omelet.
01:23:25.400,01:23:26.601,You love omelets.
01:23:28.436,01:23:29.471,You remembered.
01:23:33.108,01:23:33.775,Come on.
01:23:40.715,01:23:42.017,How old was he?
01:23:48.189,01:23:49.324,Mine would have been two.
01:23:51.359,01:23:52.594,"One and a half, I suppose."
01:23:57.298,01:24:00.402,I would have never let Kip enlist. I would have stopped him.
01:24:01.336,01:24:02.237,But I couldn't.
01:24:03.438,01:24:04.506,I was asleep.
01:24:07.542,01:24:10.445,-You didn't think the war was right? -Mm.
01:24:10.512,01:24:12.580,I never thought about it being right or wrong.
01:24:12.647,01:24:14.783,It just made us rich.
01:24:17.585,01:24:18.620,It put me on the map.
01:24:24.359,01:24:26.127,"God, I miss buying things though."
01:24:29.164,01:24:32.167,"This seems like a pretty good option, dropping out of everything."
01:24:32.400,01:24:35.370,"You know, I never thought I'd love living in a place so remote."
01:24:35.437,01:24:37.205,I could never live in the city again.
01:24:39.407,01:24:40.442,You don't get lonely?
01:24:45.480,01:24:46.481,"Actually, no."
01:24:50.752,01:24:53.822,I got-- This is my aunt's place. She's sleeping in the back room.
01:24:54.089,01:24:57.125,"-Wait, she's here? -She could sleep through an apocalypse."
01:24:57.792,01:25:01.663,"No, I'm really lucky to have her. She's my last living relative."
01:25:09.237,01:25:10.338,Do you wanna see my son?
01:25:16.811,01:25:17.679,Sure.
01:25:38.867,01:25:42.403,He made these videos for me when he was in the war.
01:25:43.238,01:25:44.139,You gotta...
01:25:50.211,01:25:51.212,"Wow, what a gift."
01:26:07.562,01:26:08.429,That was a joke.
01:26:09.397,01:26:11.633,I actually met this girl a couple of weeks ago.
01:26:12.567,01:26:18.706,She's beautiful and amazing and we've been hanging out a lot and going on walks and stuff.
01:26:18.773,01:26:22.277,"She doesn't really speak that much English but I'm teaching her. So, she loves it."
01:26:25.346,01:26:26.381,He's so handsome.
01:26:27.682,01:26:28.716,Isn't he?
01:26:43.264,01:26:44.666,I was so angry...
01:26:45.967,01:26:47.368,for so long.
01:26:52.774,01:27:02.850,But these videos have-- Have saved me. It's like-- It's like he's still here with me.
01:27:13.595,01:27:15.296,"-Oh, shit. Oh, shit. -Oh, I'm sorry."
01:27:15.363,01:27:16.664,"-Hold on. Hold on. -Oh, my God."
01:27:16.731,01:27:18.800,"Give me that napkin. Please, please, please."
01:27:18.866,01:27:20.368,Dry it-- Dry it off.
01:27:20.902,01:27:22.870,"-Oh, shit. -Oh, my God, it's gonna be fine."
01:27:23.371,01:27:25.673,"-Oh, my God, it's not working. -It's gonna be fine."
01:27:25.740,01:27:26.874,It's not fucking working.
01:27:26.941,01:27:28.943,-It's gonna be fine! -You broke it!
01:27:29.010,01:27:33.281,"I didn't break-- -Ashley, you fucking broke it. -Look, it's playing! It's playing!"
01:27:37.752,01:27:39.887,You broke it. You fucking broke it.
01:27:39.954,01:27:41.723,"It was an accident, Veronica."
01:27:41.789,01:27:44.392,-There's water spilled-- -Why are you drinking near it?
01:27:44.459,01:27:46.027,What? You put it on the table!
01:27:46.294,01:27:48.496,-This is all I have. -What?
01:27:48.563,01:27:50.732,-Ashley. -You backed them up?
01:27:51.899,01:27:53.801,"-Oh, come on. -No, I didn't back it up!"
01:27:53.868,01:27:56.304,"-Surely, you backed up your son's videos! -How?"
01:27:56.371,01:27:57.639,How? Where are we?
01:27:57.705,01:27:59.841,What are you talking about? Put it on the cloud!
01:27:59.907,01:28:01.943,-I'm in a fucking cabin. -Are you serious?
01:28:02.010,01:28:03.511,You didn't back up the videos?
01:28:03.578,01:28:09.584,No! How many times do I have to tell you? I didn't-- Do not fucking blame me for your stupid fucking mistake!
01:28:09.651,01:28:10.618,Blame you?
01:28:11.286,01:28:13.788,You are killing my son all over again.
01:29:09.877,01:29:11.079,"Get up, bitch!"
01:30:35.530,01:30:36.764,Yeah!
01:30:48.009,01:30:48.910,Fuck you!
01:31:06.561,01:31:07.662,Look at me!
01:31:07.728,01:31:08.596,Look at me!
01:32:41.088,01:32:42.223,System reboot.
01:32:42.857,01:32:43.858,System reboot.
01:32:48.963,01:33:04.679,"I was on this mountain yesterday and I took this landscape, I drew this landscape, and I thought it was so peaceful and beautiful and I just wanted to show it to you because it was so-- Um..."
01:33:04.779,01:33:05.846,I think I need to go.
01:33:08.249,01:33:10.584,"Wake up soon. I love you, mom."
