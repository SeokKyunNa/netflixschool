00:00:52.761,00:00:55.472,Grace! Grace! Grace!
00:01:46.231,00:01:49.776,'Cause I've been singing it for a long time.
00:01:50.151,00:01:53.446,This was one of the first songs I ever recorded.
00:01:53.655,00:01:59.619,"Lee Moses wrote it. And when I played it for the label, they said, Who wants to listen to this?"
00:02:00.578,00:02:02.122,And you know what I say?
00:02:05.125,00:02:06.584,"Wait, wait. Play that back."
00:02:37.907,00:02:39.617,"Sorry, Maggie, I got a real session here."
00:02:39.701,00:02:40.535,"Oh, shit."
00:02:41.536,00:02:43.204,-That's crazy. -Crazy!
00:02:43.288,00:02:44.247,"Hey, sweetie."
00:02:44.330,00:02:45.999,-Sethy! My brother. -Hey.
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.258,We're gonna be friends.
00:03:57.695,00:03:58.947,Hi.
00:03:59.864,00:04:00.823,Where are her keys?
00:04:01.616,00:04:04.077,You could lose the tone. I've had a hell of a day.
00:04:04.535,00:04:05.620,Where are the keys?
00:04:05.703,00:04:07.038,Mm-mm.
00:04:07.121,00:04:10.041,"I manage the house, not the woman that lives inside of it."
00:04:10.124,00:04:11.084,That's your job.
00:04:29.185,00:04:30.645,"Here, this is her bag."
00:04:32.981,00:04:34.565,"Hey, I'll see you at the house."
00:04:39.028,00:04:40.113,Late.
00:04:41.030,00:04:43.283,Six minutes.
00:04:43.616,00:04:45.368,-Not my best. -Nope.
00:04:45.660,00:04:46.786,How was Maui?
00:04:46.869,00:04:48.913,"Crowded, hot, pretty, fun. I don't know, hard."
00:04:48.997,00:04:51.082,What is this? That's disgusting. I don't want that.
00:04:51.165,00:04:52.125,Why'd you bring that?
00:04:52.208,00:04:53.376,You asked me to.
00:04:57.839,00:05:01.259,"Your set-changes meeting is at 2:30, and then you have the waxer at 3:15."
00:05:01.342,00:05:03.970,"-And you want a facial, yeah? -Yeah. I don't want this, though."
00:05:04.053,00:05:05.346,No more of that. My God.
00:05:05.430,00:05:09.934,"The band is coming over for the party at 5:00-ish, and tomorrow we leave at 9:30, wheels up, for New York."
00:05:10.018,00:05:11.978,And what are we doing with that producer meeting?
00:05:12.061,00:05:13.938,Jack is scheduling those.
00:05:14.022,00:05:19.110,"But about the live album, I was wondering-- Do I have rehearsal tomorrow? Is that all set?"
00:05:19.193,00:05:26.451,"Yes. Well, Dan was asking if perhaps you would wanna rehearse at his house instead of yours?"
00:05:31.205,00:05:36.085,I'd said to his assistant that that probably would not… How many Grammys do I have?
00:05:36.169,00:05:37.295,-Eleven. -Uh-huh.
00:05:37.378,00:05:39.547,And how many Grammys does Dan have?
00:05:39.630,00:05:40.757,-Eight. -Not eleven.
00:05:40.840,00:05:43.134,-No. -That's eight. That's very fewer than me.
00:05:43.217,00:05:44.552,-Mm-hmm. -A lot fewer.
00:05:46.929,00:05:50.433,You feel free to relay that to his assistant.
00:05:55.021,00:05:56.898,Oh. Thank you.
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.117,"Look at you, full of sugar."
00:06:08.201,00:06:09.035,Shit.
00:06:09.118,00:06:11.496,Just eat half of your ass.
00:06:11.579,00:06:14.791,"I'mma just eat cake, no icing. No icing."
00:06:14.874,00:06:20.880,"Jack, she will have just finished eight shows, and you want her to fly to Vegas to have a conversation with the Caesars Palace guy?"
00:06:21.005,00:06:22.924,"It's a residency, okay?"
00:06:23.007,00:06:24.926,And it's my job to find us our next gig.
00:06:25.510,00:06:27.136,This ain't your grandmama's Vegas.
00:06:27.220,00:06:30.139,Lil Jon done played there. DJ Khaled.
00:06:30.556,00:06:40.691,"Let me do my job, and you do yours, which is get her coffee, Kleenex, Kotex, and whatever else the hell we been paying you to do for the last six months."
00:06:42.610,00:06:44.320,I've been here for three years.
00:06:44.403,00:06:45.446,You get paid?
00:06:45.863,00:06:47.156,I thought you were an intern.
00:06:47.240,00:06:51.911,"Jack, I just feel like it might be a good idea if she took a break."
00:06:52.203,00:06:53.454,That's a good idea.
00:06:53.579,00:06:58.042,And what I mean by good idea… screw you and your shitty ideas.
00:06:58.126,00:06:59.836,She just got back from Hawaii.
00:06:59.961,00:07:00.920,That was work.
00:07:01.087,00:07:02.255,"Yeah, in Hawaii."
00:07:02.338,00:07:04.674,"Okay, now, guys, I'm not going back to Hawaii."
00:07:04.841,00:07:09.095,"If we're gonna do tropical, Jack, I want to go to the Maldives."
00:07:09.637,00:07:16.018,"Jack, there hasn't been a new Grace Davis record in a decade, and the fans want one."
00:07:16.144,00:07:17.311,We need one.
00:07:17.395,00:07:18.563,Let me tell you something.
00:07:18.729,00:07:21.941,I've been managing Grace longer than you've probably been alive.
00:07:23.109,00:07:25.027,"So, you think she should do new material?"
00:07:25.111,00:07:27.029,-Yeah. -Okay. Guess what.
00:07:27.196,00:07:30.867,Don't nobody give a shit about new material. Okay?
00:07:30.950,00:07:34.662,"That last album she did, it didn't do as well as she had hoped."
00:07:36.372,00:07:41.002,"Matter of fact, those was not Grace Davis numbers, and you know it."
00:07:41.169,00:07:45.381,"That was a reality check, people letting us know it's time to move on."
00:07:45.506,00:07:47.675,-To a Vegas residency? -Yeah!
00:07:47.758,00:07:53.931,Don't nobody wanna go to no Yankee-Doodle Springsteen concert and hear him play that Wrecking Ball folksy bullshit.
00:07:54.432,00:07:58.394,"Actually, that was an incredibly poignant album, and it did extremely well."
00:07:58.478,00:08:01.355,"People want Thunder Road, okay?"
00:08:01.439,00:08:04.942,And that's what we gonna give 'em. We gonna give 'em Thunder Road.
00:08:05.526,00:08:07.028,That's how I pay my mortgage.
00:08:07.111,00:08:10.198,But you wouldn't know that 'cause your little ass ain't got no mortgage.
00:08:10.281,00:08:13.242,Crazy little girl gonna tell me how to do my goddamn job.
00:08:13.326,00:08:15.995,Always coming in with some Springsteen shit.
00:08:33.304,00:08:36.015,sung by the 27-year-old Aretha Franklin.
00:08:36.599,00:08:38.726,Originally by… Bobby Blue Bland.
00:08:38.809,00:08:40.144,…Bobby Blue Bland.
00:09:07.672,00:09:10.800,"Hey, do you think you could, like, turn it up a little bit louder?"
00:09:11.217,00:09:13.219,-Headphones. -Okay.
00:09:13.302,00:09:15.596,You put them on so I can sleep.
00:09:16.556,00:09:17.390,Thank you.
00:09:42.290,00:09:43.291,Oh.
00:09:43.749,00:09:46.127,This is the song list for the live album.
00:09:46.210,00:09:47.920,-Okay. -Don't mess it up.
00:09:48.004,00:09:49.255,-I won't. -Okay.
00:09:49.338,00:09:50.673,"-Here you go. -Thank you, baby."
00:09:50.756,00:10:01.058,"I know that Jack is setting some producer meetings for the live album, and I was wondering-- Well, I was hoping, actually, if I could-- What you doing in my seat? Why you always sitting here?"
00:10:01.142,00:10:02.310,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:10:11.319,00:10:12.778,Wanna go over the set list?
00:10:14.614,00:10:16.949,No. Do you?
00:10:19.577,00:10:21.787,I got your bag of diabetes right here.
00:10:21.871,00:10:23.664,Boom. Give it to me.
00:10:23.748,00:10:25.124,"You know, I don't even like sugar."
00:10:25.207,00:10:26.125,Uh-huh.
00:10:26.208,00:10:29.045,"I only carry this on the off-chance that you might want some, you know?"
00:10:29.128,00:10:32.340,-Mm-hmm. Very kind. -But you know who ends up eating it all?
00:10:32.423,00:10:35.426,-Who? -Me. And I'm trying to do better.
00:10:35.635,00:10:36.636,Uh-huh.
00:10:39.430,00:10:43.267,"…got my spin classes, eating my salads."
00:10:44.894,00:10:49.023,Iceberg lettuce with a whole bunch of blue cheese on it is not a salad.
00:10:49.106,00:10:52.985,"Look, the menu say it's a salad, it's a goddamn salad."
00:10:53.152,00:10:54.487,-It's not a salad. -Yeah.
00:10:54.862,00:10:56.322,-Mm. -So let's go over the list.
00:10:56.405,00:10:59.533,"-No, I don't wanna go over the set list. -Grace, come on."
00:10:59.659,00:11:01.327,I'll get off this plane right now.
00:11:01.410,00:11:04.205,"You're gonna get off the plane, Jack? How are you gonna get off?"
00:11:04.288,00:11:06.957,-I bought you the plane. -You-- Oh.
00:11:07.333,00:11:10.378,My voice bought me this plane.
00:11:13.255,00:11:14.465,Give me another Red Vine.
00:11:17.343,00:11:20.388,-Know what? 20% of that's mine. -Unbelievable.
00:12:05.266,00:12:07.518,"Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Stop, stop, stop."
00:12:07.601,00:12:10.187,I'm not gonna tell you guys you're great if you're not great.
00:12:10.271,00:12:11.188,Let's do it again.
00:12:17.862,00:12:19.822,"No, no, no!"
00:12:25.995,00:12:27.246,Chicago!
00:12:27.455,00:12:32.418,"Hello… -Detroit. -I can't hear you, Maggie."
00:12:32.501,00:12:33.502,Detroit.
00:12:33.586,00:12:35.421,"I can't hear you, Detroit!"
00:12:43.012,00:12:43.846,Cold. Oh!
00:12:47.725,00:12:51.353,"Lucky her songs are good, or by now we would have tired of them."
00:12:52.563,00:12:54.023,-I need more ice. -I don't agree.
00:12:54.106,00:12:55.316,I know when I need more ice.
00:13:01.363,00:13:02.698,It's whatever come first.
00:13:12.416,00:13:14.168,Thank you!
00:13:18.464,00:13:19.757,I call tall blondie.
00:13:19.840,00:13:21.592,-Dark shorty. -I call Mr. Chocolate.
00:13:25.513,00:13:26.764,"Oh, and hello to you, too."
00:13:26.847,00:13:28.182,-Give me that. -Give me that.
00:13:29.433,00:13:31.227,-Remember Alec? Caesars Palace. -Oh!
00:13:31.310,00:13:32.561,Of course I do.
00:13:32.645,00:13:36.148,I wish I'd known you were coming. I would've gotten you box seats.
00:13:36.607,00:13:38.067,There's no need to fret.
00:13:38.150,00:13:39.568,Jack got me the hookup.
00:13:40.611,00:13:43.864,I can't tell you how stoked I am to be here having this conversation.
00:13:43.948,00:13:45.866,"We so wanna be in the you business, Grace."
00:13:46.367,00:13:48.327,Caesars is going through a full revamp.
00:13:48.410,00:13:50.538,"More seats, brighter lights, louder sound."
00:13:52.665,00:13:55.709,"And everything you're doing on tour, we can do it right there."
00:13:55.960,00:13:59.838,"-Yeah. -Five years, six years-- -Ten. -Ten."
00:14:00.047,00:14:01.465,I'd do the same thing every night?
00:14:03.884,00:14:06.303,"Easy money. Look, no stress, all right?"
00:14:06.512,00:14:07.513,No more touring.
00:14:07.596,00:14:08.430,I love touring.
00:14:10.015,00:14:11.767,"No, I like touring. I don't like groupies."
00:14:17.189,00:14:19.316,I'm just trying to take a little pressure off myself.
00:14:19.400,00:14:22.778,"I found your lucky glass. It was on the balcony, which was weird."
00:14:23.112,00:14:26.615,"-I'm sorry. I didn't-- -Sweetheart, be an angel, -get me a drink. No soda. -Get."
00:14:26.907,00:14:29.451,Celine Dion did over a thousand shows for us.
00:14:29.535,00:14:32.663,"But I think with your fan base, we can beat that record."
00:14:32.746,00:14:34.164,"Man, come on."
00:14:34.248,00:14:35.791,"Man, come on."
00:14:37.835,00:14:39.044,It's nathan.
00:14:39.128,00:14:40.421,It's… nathan.
00:14:40.838,00:14:42.882,"If you want the feel of touring, we can do it."
00:14:42.965,00:14:46.552,"We'll leave from Vegas, drive you around, return to Vegas. Feel like you're touring."
00:14:46.635,00:14:47.469,Whatever you want.
00:14:47.553,00:14:51.390,"Grace, there's a problem with the house monitor, so we just need to do another sound check."
00:14:51.473,00:14:52.641,"Oh, my God. Okay. So sorry."
00:14:52.725,00:14:54.393,"-Duty calls. Gotta go. -Of course, yeah."
00:14:54.476,00:14:58.355,We'll do anything to get you there. So… Thank you for coming. Enjoy the show.
00:15:15.497,00:15:16.832,Hey.
00:15:17.082,00:15:18.042,Are you okay?
00:15:18.125,00:15:19.793,Yeah. I can't sleep.
00:15:21.211,00:15:22.212,Do you want some tea?
00:15:22.296,00:15:24.548,Or I think Jack has a lot of Ambien.
00:15:25.507,00:15:28.552,No. It's fine. Stop. Relax.
00:15:28.636,00:15:29.720,What are you doing?
00:15:30.721,00:15:31.722,Schedule stuff.
00:15:33.307,00:15:34.516,What are you listening to?
00:15:42.524,00:15:43.776,Such a good song.
00:15:44.944,00:15:46.737,Maxine Brown.
00:15:47.780,00:15:49.239,You know who originally wrote this?
00:15:49.323,00:15:50.616,Yeah. Carole King.
00:15:50.699,00:15:53.035,-Very good. -She's my favorite songwriter.
00:15:53.118,00:15:54.119,Really?
00:15:54.203,00:15:55.120,Other than you.
00:15:55.204,00:15:56.121,Thank you.
00:15:57.331,00:15:59.041,I'm joking.
00:15:59.124,00:16:00.084,Here.
00:16:02.211,00:16:04.797,That was a really good move back there with Mr. Vegas.
00:16:09.468,00:16:12.346,Oh. Like you can read me so well.
00:16:13.973,00:16:16.141,-Sorry. -I'm kidding.
00:16:16.350,00:16:18.143,I can't believe he pulled that.
00:16:18.227,00:16:19.812,He's just looking out for me.
00:16:20.187,00:16:26.318,He and I have been hustling together since I was… Since I was 18.
00:16:26.610,00:16:32.491,I used to do these sets at these late-night divey piano bars.
00:16:32.825,00:16:36.912,"They were, like, sticky floors, like, smoke everywhere."
00:16:36.996,00:16:40.165,"Sound system was terrible. They were awful. Like, awful."
00:16:43.544,00:16:50.676,"He would show up and he'd be standing in the back… and his mouth was just, like, hanging open, looking at me."
00:16:51.927,00:17:02.521,For where we come from… getting locked into a Vegas residency… that is a win.
00:17:03.230,00:17:04.189,What?
00:17:05.357,00:17:06.316,Nothing.
00:17:08.569,00:17:16.368,I know everyone is happy with me… doing the same show every night.
00:17:18.245,00:17:22.207,"I don't know, what if… Whatever."
00:17:23.375,00:17:26.003,-I remember watching you on Oprah… -Which time?
00:17:26.336,00:17:28.672,-…when I was little. -I've done Oprah so many times.
00:17:28.756,00:17:30.841,I think you were talking about your third album.
00:17:30.924,00:17:32.259,Mm-hmm.
00:17:32.342,00:17:35.721,And you said this thing that I'll never forget.
00:17:35.804,00:17:37.181,I think about it all the time.
00:17:38.015,00:17:42.352,"You said, When there are no more surprises, then who am I doing it for?"
00:17:44.271,00:17:45.355,Oprah.
00:17:46.065,00:17:47.149,Oprah.
00:17:47.649,00:17:48.901,Long time ago.
00:17:49.276,00:17:50.194,Mm-hmm.
00:17:50.277,00:17:52.029,"So, has this just been, like, a long con?"
00:17:52.112,00:17:52.946,Yes.
00:17:53.030,00:17:58.660,"Ever since I was a little girl, I've dreamed of giving you an enema in Toronto."
00:17:58.744,00:18:00.788,Okay. Do not bring up Toronto.
00:18:15.552,00:18:18.847,"-Katie, she has no family or friends. -She has no family or friends."
00:18:18.931,00:18:21.809,You're not friends. We are friends. You know how I know we're friends?
00:18:21.892,00:18:24.645,Because friends don't pay friends to be their friends.
00:18:27.064,00:18:29.733,I actually feel like I pay for a lot of stuff in this relationship.
00:18:29.817,00:18:31.360,"This is like a trap, you know?"
00:18:32.194,00:18:35.405,You are not the only person in the world for her.
00:18:35.489,00:18:37.699,You are my only person in my world.
00:18:38.826,00:18:42.204,But if you told 12-year-old me that one day I'd be working for Grace Davis?
00:18:42.287,00:18:43.622,"I mean, she's an icon."
00:18:45.499,00:18:47.876,"Or at least it's, like, the gateway to my actual dream job."
00:18:47.960,00:18:50.504,"It's the gateway to, like, Stockholm syndrome."
00:18:50.587,00:18:53.132,"Hey, I thought you left your phone in the car."
00:18:54.508,00:18:56.552,I left my phone in the car. This is my work phone.
00:18:56.635,00:18:58.470,"Okay. You know what? Listen to me, Maggie."
00:18:58.554,00:19:00.139,-Yes. -Phone down. Eyes on me.
00:19:00.222,00:19:12.860,"I know you think that she's gonna give you this, like, life-changing shot, and you guys are gonna ride off into the sunset holding hands or some shit, but I think we need to consider the possibility that this woman doesn't even know your last name."
00:19:12.943,00:19:14.695,"She does, sometimes."
00:19:14.778,00:19:21.326,"Do we think she's gonna stop making you wear her shoes around the house to break them in, and, oh, I don't know, make you her producer?"
00:19:21.410,00:19:22.619,Yes!
00:19:22.703,00:19:23.662,Maggie!
00:19:23.745,00:19:25.998,"She only did that once, and it was for the Grammys."
00:19:26.081,00:19:27.875,Can you please want more for yourself?
00:19:28.417,00:19:30.794,We are like this.
00:19:55.068,00:19:56.486,I don't work here.
00:19:57.362,00:19:58.363,But yes.
00:20:00.490,00:20:01.700,Great song.
00:20:02.701,00:20:03.827,You don't think so?
00:20:03.911,00:20:04.870,What?
00:20:11.084,00:20:13.629,"Ooh! He holds it out the whole time, you know?"
00:20:17.758,00:20:20.260,-Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:20.636,00:20:21.803,"Yeah, Phantom Planet."
00:20:22.054,00:20:23.305,Very good.
00:20:23.388,00:20:26.141,"Well, everybody knows this song. It's from The O.C."
00:20:26.225,00:20:27.267,"Great show, right?"
00:20:30.187,00:20:31.146,I have to go.
00:20:37.778,00:20:41.448,is affecting your ability to appreciate the musical complexity of the song.
00:20:43.992,00:20:48.121,"Well, of all the songs about California, this is not the one that I would pick."
00:20:48.205,00:20:49.122,Okay.
00:20:49.206,00:20:50.916,"Joni Mitchell's California, maybe."
00:20:50.999,00:20:53.460,Or Going Back to Cali or California Dreamin'.
00:20:53.543,00:20:55.003,They're all way better than this.
00:20:55.087,00:20:56.630,-California Love. -Yeah.
00:20:56.713,00:20:58.465,Zeppelin's Going to California.
00:20:58.548,00:20:59.633,That's an amazing song.
00:20:59.758,00:21:01.593,Okay. Hotel California.
00:21:02.636,00:21:06.556,"Uh… -What's wrong with Hotel California? -Well, the Eagles are hokey."
00:21:06.640,00:21:09.309,And Don Henley is a very mean man.
00:21:09.476,00:21:13.855,Randy Meisner almost died of a stomach ulcer because the band hated each other so much.
00:21:13.939,00:21:16.400,"Yeah, but it's a perfect song. It's underrated, to be honest."
00:21:16.525,00:21:17.901,-Underrated? -Yeah.
00:21:17.985,00:21:19.403,It's literally always on.
00:21:20.028,00:21:23.115,"It's, like, the Brown Eyed Girl of Southern California soft rock."
00:21:23.198,00:21:26.285,So the Eagles won't make your fantasy dinner party. Who does?
00:21:27.202,00:21:28.787,"-Popsicle? -No, thanks."
00:21:30.080,00:21:31.707,"Well, living or dead?"
00:21:32.374,00:21:33.834,It doesn't matter.
00:21:34.084,00:21:35.711,"Um, Brian Wilson."
00:21:36.253,00:21:37.170,Mm-hmm.
00:21:37.713,00:21:38.755,Nina Simone.
00:21:38.839,00:21:40.257,She and I have the same birthday.
00:21:40.340,00:21:41.675,Me and Mariah Carey.
00:21:41.800,00:21:45.053,So we're both very demanding and very deeply sad.
00:21:45.345,00:21:46.638,Yeah.
00:21:48.265,00:21:52.644,"You're not one of those girls who learned about Otis Redding from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, are you?"
00:21:52.728,00:21:54.187,I'm not going to respond to that.
00:21:54.271,00:21:55.772,-So yes. Last one. -Hi.
00:21:56.023,00:21:57.899,-Hi. -Sam Cooke.
00:21:57.983,00:21:59.568,Who's Sam Cooke?
00:21:59.651,00:22:00.652,Who's Sam Cooke?
00:22:00.736,00:22:02.321,"Yeah, who's Sam Cooke?"
00:22:02.404,00:22:04.656,"You know Phantom Planet, but you don't know Sam Cooke?"
00:22:07.242,00:22:08.910,for live music and free vitamin-B shots.
00:22:08.994,00:22:10.245,I'm having a party next week.
00:22:10.704,00:22:11.788,You should come.
00:22:14.458,00:22:15.834,For the Popsicles.
00:22:19.671,00:22:25.010,"I'm David Cliff, and I'm going to start off with a song from the King of Soul, Sam Cooke."
00:22:52.871,00:22:54.039,Son of a bitch.
00:22:58.168,00:23:01.671,The label guys want to know all about Vegas.
00:23:06.384,00:23:08.637,You know what? Let's just talk about this later.
00:23:08.762,00:23:11.556,Continue to do your Euca-load of shit.
00:23:16.436,00:23:23.401,I don't want to sit with a bunch of label guys who… What is that line?
00:23:24.903,00:23:28.532,…have to be reminded that I'm still alive.
00:23:28.907,00:23:30.826,What did we sit here and talk about?
00:23:34.663,00:23:41.753,"I've already done a greatest hits album and a live album, and now a greatest hits live album?"
00:23:43.964,00:23:48.260,"Look, when I agreed to come back, what did you promise me?"
00:23:49.136,00:23:50.220,Huh?
00:23:50.303,00:23:52.764,You said you was gonna listen to me this time.
00:23:53.515,00:23:57.394,All I want to do is play it safe so we can stack some money.
00:23:58.812,00:24:03.316,"No, you pathetic 'cause you arguing with me, and your ass should be on vocal rest."
00:24:03.400,00:24:07.737,I will decide what I want to do next.
00:24:07.821,00:24:09.865,"-Yes. -Give me the Popsicles, Maggie."
00:24:12.367,00:24:13.451,You always walk away!
00:24:14.286,00:24:17.247,"Grace, now ain't the time for some damn sabbatical."
00:24:53.950,00:24:55.785,"Oh, shit."
00:24:57.871,00:25:00.081,"He been working on this shit, like, two weeks, okay?"
00:25:00.165,00:25:02.125,"So look. I haven't heard it, either."
00:25:02.209,00:25:05.545,"So before you start complaining, at least give the man a listen."
00:25:06.129,00:25:07.797,-Hi. -Richie Williams.
00:25:08.089,00:25:10.508,"-R-Dub, that's what they call me. -Yeah. Nice to meet you."
00:25:10.592,00:25:13.386,I feel like we met at the Met Ball or Oscar awards?
00:25:13.470,00:25:14.930,Or a rave? You ever go to raves?
00:25:15.180,00:25:16.514,"Don't go to raves, Richie."
00:25:16.848,00:25:18.433,We're gonna go to one with this remix.
00:25:19.935,00:25:22.354,Richie Williams' version of Bad Girl.
00:25:26.441,00:25:27.317,Yeah.
00:25:32.239,00:25:33.907,Signature sound right there.
00:25:33.990,00:25:34.824,Yup.
00:25:42.040,00:25:43.250,Trick question. This is dope.
00:25:43.333,00:25:44.376,-Gotcha. -We know that.
00:25:44.459,00:25:45.794,"I mean, all of it."
00:25:46.211,00:25:47.545,"What are you doing here, Maggie?"
00:25:47.629,00:25:51.424,Um… Richie Williams. R-Dubs. Grammy Award winner.
00:25:51.508,00:25:52.676,I'm working on the album.
00:25:52.759,00:25:55.262,"If you wanna sit in the session, I can mentor you a bit."
00:25:55.345,00:25:57.180,It's important for me to raise women up.
00:25:58.723,00:26:00.934,We ain't got time for that. Let's get back into it.
00:26:01.017,00:26:02.477,Let's focus. Don't worry about her.
00:26:02.560,00:26:04.646,The album kinda feels done. Let's talk about it.
00:26:04.938,00:26:07.649,"This version of Bad Girl, the old one's kinda old, right?"
00:26:07.816,00:26:08.775,Feels old or whatever.
00:26:08.900,00:26:10.986,I feel like this one spiced it up a little bit.
00:26:11.194,00:26:12.153,Feels global now.
00:26:12.362,00:26:13.738,Global. All right?
00:26:13.822,00:26:16.032,"Matter of fact, intergalactical."
00:26:18.827,00:26:20.745,"Grace, may I please speak with you for a moment?"
00:26:21.538,00:26:27.335,"-What? -Well, I just wanted to… -Oh, my God. Spit it out. -I did a cut of the album."
00:26:28.461,00:26:29.421,I did a cut.
00:26:30.338,00:26:31.923,Seth helped me.
00:26:32.007,00:26:35.468,"You hadn't hired anybody to do it yet, and I didn't want to tell you or Jack."
00:26:37.929,00:26:40.515,"Y'all know it's a damn microphone in there, right?"
00:26:40.807,00:26:42.434,How long have you been working on this?
00:26:42.517,00:26:45.437,"I came in before work and after work, and whenever I could."
00:26:45.520,00:26:46.604,I should have asked you.
00:26:46.688,00:26:47.564,Yeah.
00:26:47.647,00:26:48.898,I just wanted to take a shot.
00:26:51.067,00:26:52.527,Do you want to hear it?
00:26:57.449,00:27:02.412,"You're always talking about how there has to be a heartbeat, something to hold on to and then give away."
00:27:02.746,00:27:03.830,And this is it.
00:27:04.831,00:27:10.503,"Hanky's been playing this drum track for 20 years, and it still sounds as tight as it did on the day you recorded it."
00:27:10.587,00:27:11.921,-Richard. -R-Dawg.
00:27:12.005,00:27:13.465,Did you redo this with a synth?
00:27:13.673,00:27:20.430,"It's actually called cross synthesis, which I invented, which takes one synth and cancels the other out when they play at the same time. Sounds dope."
00:27:20.513,00:27:21.765,That doesn't make any sense.
00:27:23.600,00:27:25.226,"You've heard of cross synthesis, right?"
00:27:25.310,00:27:27.520,"No, but it don't matter. You the producer."
00:27:27.645,00:27:29.689,-Yeah. -You took out the backup singers?
00:27:29.773,00:27:31.358,"They're kinda old-sounding, honestly."
00:27:31.441,00:27:33.568,-We got plug-ins that do that stuff. -Ah.
00:27:36.654,00:27:40.367,"I put my voice in and stacked it, put some auto-tune, it sounds brand-new. Sounds great."
00:27:45.246,00:27:48.458,You should not be buried under all this flashy bullshit.
00:27:48.917,00:27:57.801,"Sure, the track needs some mixing and some editing, but you could release your demos and they would be way better than anything that he's ever, ever done."
00:27:59.719,00:28:03.223,"I think you should release your demos, 'cause I've heard them. They're unbelievable."
00:28:03.306,00:28:05.683,"Who the hell you think you are, Missy Elliott?"
00:28:06.976,00:28:09.270,How you gonna come in here and insult Richie?
00:28:09.354,00:28:10.522,"-Go to Starbucks! -Okay, okay."
00:28:10.605,00:28:12.107,"Everybody, stop."
00:28:15.652,00:28:20.115,"Margaret, never talk to anyone that Jack has hired that way again, do you understand?"
00:28:20.281,00:28:21.491,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:28:21.658,00:28:22.492,Yes.
00:28:22.575,00:28:23.618,-Never. -Never.
00:28:30.875,00:28:32.710,"-Don't worry about hers, man. -Oh, I'm not."
00:28:36.756,00:28:37.841,What?
00:28:37.924,00:28:46.516,Wha… Maggie.
00:28:47.016,00:28:47.976,Come here.
00:28:49.477,00:28:57.777,I don't know what planet you come from where rattling off every little opinion that's rolling around in that brain of yours is considered a skill.
00:28:57.861,00:29:00.697,But… I was right.
00:29:00.780,00:29:05.201,This is not about being right in the studio for a moment in time.
00:29:05.577,00:29:06.619,This is a marathon.
00:29:06.828,00:29:07.787,"I'm sorry, I disagree."
00:29:07.871,00:29:11.082,"I think if she put out something like that, oh, my God."
00:29:12.459,00:29:16.379,Obviously… we would never put out garbage like that.
00:29:17.422,00:29:19.841,But that's besides the point.
00:29:19.924,00:29:23.803,It took me months to get them in a studio together.
00:29:25.096,00:29:26.014,Months.
00:29:26.097,00:29:30.685,"Off the off-chance she might say, Hey, Jack. I want to do a remix album."
00:29:31.311,00:29:33.480,"And I say, I got the perfect person."
00:29:34.147,00:29:35.565,"Oh, damn."
00:29:35.648,00:29:44.365,"We can't work with him anymore, because your dumbass assistant insulted the man, and he don't wanna work with you no more."
00:29:44.491,00:29:46.493,He'd rather do Rihanna.
00:29:49.162,00:29:52.916,"Well, I… I apologize for that."
00:29:55.293,00:29:59.714,"And now that I'm the producer, I will look for my replacement."
00:29:59.798,00:30:05.929,Do you know how long it took for Seth to get a little bitty engineering credit?
00:30:07.096,00:30:15.814,Being a producer is about having a point of view that you've earned over years of hard work.
00:30:16.189,00:30:17.857,It don't happen like this.
00:30:17.982,00:30:19.692,You are not a producer.
00:30:19.776,00:30:21.653,You're not an artist.
00:30:21.736,00:30:23.029,You're not a manager.
00:30:23.738,00:30:31.538,"If you wanna be a producer, you find your own goddamn clients and stay the hell out of mine."
00:30:53.810,00:30:55.103,-We're gonna go in there… -Yes.
00:30:55.186,00:30:58.606,…then we're gonna get some drinks and then we are going to find him.
00:30:58.690,00:31:01.359,"I'll give him the spiel, and then leave as quickly as possible."
00:31:01.442,00:31:02.986,"No, we don't have to leave so quickly."
00:31:03.069,00:31:04.529,We're having fun. We're hanging out.
00:31:04.612,00:31:06.406,When was the last time you went to a party?
00:31:06.489,00:31:07.866,-Do work parties count? -No.
00:31:08.366,00:31:11.160,"I went, technically, to Elton John's Oscar party."
00:31:14.122,00:31:15.290,"Whoa, he has a pool?"
00:31:15.373,00:31:16.332,Whoo!
00:31:16.416,00:31:19.294,Do any of them have jobs?
00:31:20.295,00:31:21.880,Hi. Excuse me. Do you have a job?
00:31:21.963,00:31:22.881,I'm a model.
00:31:22.964,00:31:23.798,Okay.
00:31:23.882,00:31:25.550,It's a Wednesday.
00:31:27.468,00:31:29.053,"What is… Oh, my God."
00:31:29.137,00:31:33.892,"Wait, I thought you said he performed at a grocery store, not that he owned it."
00:31:35.852,00:31:36.895,"Yeah, I'm ready."
00:31:38.646,00:31:40.481,"-Oh! -Oh, my God. Is it bad?"
00:31:41.941,00:31:43.526,Ugh. This is so crazy.
00:31:43.610,00:31:45.653,I know. Why does he have a blow-dryer?
00:31:47.113,00:31:48.489,I don't even know him.
00:31:48.573,00:31:51.159,"Hey, man from last week."
00:31:51.242,00:32:00.335,"I just want you to remind yourself of me, and I would like to tell you that I'm just a personal assistant, but I'd love to produce your music -if you got any. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey."
00:32:00.418,00:32:06.299,"Look, all I do is basically clean up biohazardous materials, but I get to walk around and call myself a doctor."
00:32:06.382,00:32:07.634,That's not all you do.
00:32:07.717,00:32:10.136,Exactly. Do not sell yourself short.
00:32:10.261,00:32:14.933,You just produced a live Grace Davis album for no money and no credit.
00:32:15.016,00:32:16.768,And you're gonna do it again. You know why?
00:32:16.851,00:32:18.311,Because you're following your dream.
00:32:18.394,00:32:20.521,"No, that's not my dream. I don't wanna do that again."
00:32:20.605,00:32:22.065,I'd love to get money and credit.
00:32:22.148,00:32:24.359,"God, he has so many products. Ooh."
00:32:24.442,00:32:27.528,We shouldn't go through his stuff yet 'cause we don't even know him!
00:32:27.612,00:32:29.280,"Well, I've done it, and here we are."
00:32:29.364,00:32:35.078,"Look, you need to pull yourself together and tell your vision-impaired, fresh-breathed client that you are a producer."
00:32:35.745,00:32:39.415,"I am not a-- You are so lucky, Maggie."
00:32:39.749,00:32:42.210,"So you get out there, and you close that deal."
00:32:42.293,00:32:43.127,Okay.
00:32:43.211,00:32:44.921,You're way too comfortable in his house.
00:32:48.216,00:32:49.175,Thanks for dressing up.
00:32:52.929,00:32:54.806,-This is Katie. She's my roommate. -Katie. Hi.
00:32:55.223,00:32:56.683,-Nice to meet you. -You're handsome.
00:32:56.766,00:32:57.684,Thank you.
00:32:57.767,00:32:59.644,Did you know that Maggie's a music producer?
00:33:01.854,00:33:03.773,I like to say the ear of our generation.
00:33:03.856,00:33:06.484,Katie. Thank you so much for coming to this party.
00:33:06.567,00:33:09.529,Got it. I'm gonna see how much cheese I can fit into my bag.
00:33:09.612,00:33:11.948,And then I'm gonna look his house up on Zillow.
00:33:12.073,00:33:13.032,Please don't.
00:33:14.492,00:33:16.035,Can't make any promises.
00:33:17.328,00:33:18.204,"Oh, my God."
00:33:18.287,00:33:20.790,You want another drink to actually drink this time?
00:33:20.873,00:33:24.335,And here I was thinking you had a crush on me and just had to see me again.
00:33:24.419,00:33:26.212,"Oh, no, I'm just here for the pipes."
00:33:26.295,00:33:29.090,"Babe, I thought you were bringing me a vodka Red Bull?"
00:33:29.173,00:33:31.009,"Theresa, this is Maggie."
00:33:31.092,00:33:32.593,Maggie's a producer.
00:33:33.720,00:33:35.138,I work at SpaceX.
00:33:36.180,00:33:37.265,Cool.
00:33:43.479,00:33:45.606,Why don't you come out? DJ for us.
00:33:45.690,00:33:46.649,Wow.
00:33:48.234,00:33:49.318,Is that your girlfriend?
00:33:49.610,00:33:51.654,She's not looking for anything serious.
00:33:52.196,00:33:53.281,Good for her.
00:33:53.364,00:33:54.323,Mm-hmm.
00:33:54.615,00:33:55.992,You have some lipstick.
00:33:56.325,00:33:57.285,Right here?
00:33:57.410,00:33:59.203,-All around your face. -Mm.
00:33:59.912,00:34:01.289,Do you have any songs recorded?
00:34:01.831,00:34:03.624,-Yeah. -Can I hear them?
00:34:04.917,00:34:06.794,-Now? -Yeah.
00:34:39.744,00:34:41.287,"Yeah, it took me, like, 20 minutes."
00:34:41.829,00:34:42.997,The first verse?
00:34:43.081,00:34:44.040,Whole song.
00:34:45.041,00:34:48.461,Why are you performing at grocery stores?
00:34:49.003,00:34:50.379,I like it.
00:34:50.463,00:34:54.300,"It's fun, it's no pressure, it's just… It's nice."
00:34:55.093,00:34:57.136,"Well, you can write."
00:34:57.970,00:35:04.268,"And you've got the voice and the tone, and, I mean, an amazing record collection."
00:35:04.352,00:35:09.857,"That Marvin Gaye and… This Elmore James, I had this CD in my car for, like, six years."
00:35:09.941,00:35:11.609,That was the first album my dad gave me.
00:35:11.734,00:35:12.693,Really?
00:35:16.906,00:35:25.123,"Well, I would love to-- I mean, if you are… I could work with you if you wanted."
00:35:25.206,00:35:26.165,I'm listening.
00:35:28.376,00:35:29.836,"Well, you have an amazing sound."
00:35:29.919,00:35:31.129,Thank you.
00:35:31.212,00:35:34.549,"I mean, there's a couple of things that I… If I may?"
00:35:35.133,00:35:36.843,"Please, you may."
00:35:38.052,00:35:44.016,I think that your producer might be… Sucks.
00:35:44.100,00:35:46.018,"He's a friend of mine, and he does it for free."
00:35:46.102,00:35:51.190,"I mean, what… What exactly do you wanna do differently?"
00:35:51.899,00:35:56.028,"Well, to start, I would… Your bassist is way too loud."
00:35:56.445,00:35:58.447,And then I'd probably drop that weird drum track.
00:35:58.531,00:35:59.866,And then I'd move the bridge up.
00:35:59.949,00:36:03.619,And then you should definitely be singing into a real mic.
00:36:04.495,00:36:07.623,"I mean, I'm so sorry, but where did you record this, in a closet?"
00:36:07.707,00:36:08.583,Wine cellar.
00:36:09.208,00:36:10.042,Who?
00:36:10.126,00:36:13.713,My wine cellar. I thought the acoustics would be better.
00:36:13.838,00:36:16.340,Ooh. Will you send me the files?
00:36:16.465,00:36:17.383,No.
00:36:18.426,00:36:19.343,Please?
00:36:23.264,00:36:24.974,Come to my show next week.
00:36:27.351,00:36:32.106,"I… Well, I should ask Katie 'cause next week I was-- What's that?"
00:36:32.190,00:36:33.149,A jacket.
00:36:33.441,00:36:34.942,"So, I'll see you next Friday?"
00:36:36.694,00:36:39.113,"Oh, my God. Do you wear this?"
00:36:39.989,00:36:41.199,"Oh, my God."
00:36:41.282,00:36:42.283,What is that?
00:36:42.408,00:36:45.494,This looks like Stevie Nicks ran over Jason Derulo with her car.
00:36:45.578,00:36:47.330,"-Okay. All right, we're done. -Oh, my God."
00:36:47.413,00:36:49.290,-Thank you so much. We're good. -That is wild.
00:36:49.373,00:36:50.833,That's enough. That's enough.
00:37:12.855,00:37:15.024,"Hey, you know who's been up for 37 hours?"
00:37:15.107,00:37:17.985,Me… you dick.
00:37:23.199,00:37:29.455,So if you can please just make sure that she takes the fish oil and the little green one after she eats dinner because they upset her stomach.
00:37:29.538,00:37:33.000,Wow. You're really the only person I know who can make pills not fun.
00:37:33.459,00:37:34.418,Wait.
00:37:34.502,00:37:36.629,Why are you leaving early? You never leave early.
00:37:36.712,00:37:41.968,Um… Because I gotta go to this thing at the airport.
00:37:43.135,00:37:46.138,'Cause my… My gran is-- I don't care about any of that.
00:37:46.222,00:37:47.223,Sorry.
00:37:47.306,00:37:48.557,And I don't believe it.
00:37:48.641,00:37:51.060,It sounds like a whole lot of B. Bullcrap.
00:37:51.560,00:37:53.729,This is exactly what happens.
00:37:54.063,00:37:57.066,"It starts off with a thing, and then you're gonna ask for a weekend off."
00:37:57.149,00:37:58.901,All of you assistants are the same.
00:37:58.985,00:38:05.241,"You get lured in here by the glitz, the glamour, the swag, the celebrity, the pool house."
00:38:05.324,00:38:06.534,You live in the pool house.
00:38:06.617,00:38:08.244,"And you could, too."
00:38:09.537,00:38:16.585,"Not at this moment because I'm not in the market for a roommate, but maybe someday… if you play your cards right."
00:38:16.669,00:38:18.045,What are you doing?
00:38:19.088,00:38:20.881,This is all available to you.
00:38:21.799,00:38:23.301,Ah! Ha.
00:38:23.884,00:38:24.844,Found 'em.
00:38:25.678,00:38:27.430,"Wow, I thought you were cleaning the pool."
00:38:27.513,00:38:29.098,"See, these are a gift from Grace."
00:38:29.181,00:38:31.350,Do I prefer Dior? Of course I do.
00:38:32.018,00:38:33.102,Am I gonna tell her that?
00:38:33.185,00:38:40.568,"No. I'm gonna be grateful for what I have, and for what she's discarded because she's bored with it 'cause then it comes to me."
00:38:41.527,00:38:42.778,And I can wear it.
00:38:43.779,00:38:46.949,And you gotta start carrying a notebook around to write this stuff down.
00:38:55.416,00:38:56.876,Margaret!
00:38:57.752,00:38:59.378,Margaret!
00:39:01.130,00:39:02.506,Margaret!
00:39:04.258,00:39:05.551,Margaret!
00:39:06.093,00:39:06.927,Hi.
00:39:07.011,00:39:09.180,What do you think of this? Do you think it's too booby?
00:39:09.263,00:39:11.140,Mm… Yes.
00:39:11.682,00:39:12.641,Oh.
00:39:13.434,00:39:14.393,Perfect.
00:39:14.685,00:39:15.644,You can go.
00:39:15.936,00:39:17.438,"Oh. Okay, great. Thank you so much."
00:39:17.521,00:39:18.564,"No, not you."
00:39:19.607,00:39:21.776,You guys can go. Thank you.
00:39:21.859,00:39:22.818,Thanks.
00:39:26.364,00:39:30.659,Are you sure all of this is still okay with you?
00:39:30.993,00:39:38.959,"Um… 'Cause after that little show at the recording studio, I'm not sure."
00:39:40.169,00:39:44.882,"Because if there is something else you wanna be doing, I don't want you to be here if you don't wanna be here."
00:39:47.218,00:39:52.515,"No, Grace, I… -Yes? -I wanna be here."
00:39:53.015,00:39:59.397,"Good, because I wanna go through my closet and donate things that aren't sparking joy or whatever."
00:39:59.480,00:40:00.898,"Yeah, right now?"
00:40:00.981,00:40:01.941,Yeah.
00:40:03.317,00:40:04.235,Great.
00:40:07.530,00:40:09.198,Joy. Definitely joy.
00:40:09.615,00:40:10.533,Joy.
00:40:12.326,00:40:13.160,Mm.
00:40:14.120,00:40:15.579,-Joy. -Joyful.
00:40:18.124,00:40:20.084,"Yeah, that's what I like to hear."
00:40:20.543,00:40:25.381,"Well, I'm David Cliff, and this is my band, and we're gonna play a couple songs for y'all, if that's okay."
00:40:32.763,00:40:35.975,"Obviously, I'm keeping the Gianni Versace."
00:40:36.100,00:40:36.934,Obviously.
00:40:37.017,00:40:37.977,Yeah.
00:40:39.228,00:40:41.355,All right. So we did all the evening wear.
00:40:43.774,00:40:45.776,Let's do the early evening wear.
00:40:46.318,00:40:47.987,-Come on. -'Kay.
00:40:49.530,00:40:51.699,"All right, I've got one more song for y'all tonight."
00:40:55.953,00:40:56.871,Thanks for coming.
00:41:18.684,00:41:20.728,"Wow, I didn't think you'd show up."
00:41:20.811,00:41:21.770,"Well, we had a deal."
00:41:23.355,00:41:24.523,"So, what'd you think?"
00:41:24.607,00:41:27.276,"Um, well, that was a great song choice."
00:41:27.526,00:41:28.402,Ah.
00:41:28.486,00:41:31.071,And you sounded incredible. Really good.
00:41:31.614,00:41:33.449,Great start. What else?
00:41:34.533,00:41:40.539,"Um, well… your band… I knew it. You couldn't even last a minute!"
00:41:40.623,00:41:42.541,-The drummer. -That's my friend!
00:41:42.625,00:41:44.627,-Is he? Is he really? -Here we go.
00:41:44.710,00:41:46.629,Here we go again. Wow.
00:41:46.712,00:41:51.300,"You asked me, and I'm not gonna tell you that they're great if they're not great."
00:41:53.093,00:41:57.932,"I know there's a compliment in there somewhere for me, if you want to be more direct."
00:41:58.015,00:41:59.683,Can I show you something?
00:42:00.226,00:42:01.602,Is this your car?
00:42:01.977,00:42:03.145,Yeah.
00:42:03.229,00:42:04.563,Should I sign a waiver?
00:42:09.109,00:42:10.361,Okay.
00:42:22.039,00:42:23.040,Is this my song?
00:42:24.875,00:42:29.797,"Oh, my… The drum pattern is not bad."
00:42:30.047,00:42:32.675,"I also brought you up a bit, and I re-recorded the guitar."
00:42:32.967,00:42:36.095,"Yes, it's good. It's good."
00:42:37.346,00:42:40.266,You have real talent. You really do.
00:42:40.349,00:42:42.393,Do you need me? No.
00:42:43.018,00:42:47.731,But you should want me because I think I can help bring out an entirely different sound in you.
00:42:48.983,00:42:51.819,"And if you work with me, I can get you heard by the right people."
00:42:52.152,00:42:53.612,"Oh, I'm not worried about that."
00:42:54.572,00:42:57.324,I just want to know who else you working with right now.
00:42:58.158,00:43:01.328,A producer never discusses artists with other artists.
00:43:01.412,00:43:05.124,That's just not part of the… Okay.
00:43:05.916,00:43:07.209,Okay.
00:43:07.543,00:43:13.048,How do you… How do you know how to do all of this stuff?
00:43:16.176,00:43:20.014,I grew up around music and musicians and people talking about music.
00:43:20.306,00:43:23.142,"My dad worked in radio, and my mom was a singer."
00:43:23.601,00:43:29.857,"And then I went to school for composing, and then immediately after, I started… producing."
00:43:30.232,00:43:36.196,"If you could point to any time in my life, good or bad, I could tell you who I was listening to and how I got through it."
00:43:36.697,00:43:50.252,"And if I had the opportunity to work with an artist like you… and create something that could maybe make somebody or anybody feel a little bit less alone, then I want to be a part of that."
00:43:51.337,00:43:53.547,I know how to be a part of that.
00:43:54.548,00:44:05.976,So… …The Band.
00:44:11.899,00:44:13.192,"All right, when do we start?"
00:44:17.029,00:44:17.946,Now.
00:44:18.030,00:44:19.114,Now?
00:44:20.240,00:44:27.665,"Well, I… No, actually I have to… Tomorrow or, you know, when I can find time, I'll have my office reach out."
00:44:27.748,00:44:29.208,The office. All right.
00:44:30.584,00:44:32.711,"Okay, get out! I gotta go. Come on."
00:44:35.214,00:44:41.512,I know. I have to work in the morning. I'm in demand… by an artist who doesn't have their shirts custom-made.
00:44:51.855,00:44:53.065,"It's good though, right?"
00:44:58.320,00:45:02.991,Grace Davis is set to release a live album recorded at her tenth world tour.
00:45:03.075,00:45:06.286,The music icon has remained a remarkably private person.
00:45:06.662,00:45:11.083,"She's never married or had children, and is tight-lipped about her plans for the future."
00:45:12.042,00:45:15.796,"All her fans are wondering, When can they expect another hit?"
00:45:16.046,00:45:21.218,"But first, hitmaker Cardi B on what it's like to have yet another number-one song."
00:45:23.220,00:45:24.221,You okay?
00:45:25.889,00:45:27.015,Do I not look okay?
00:45:27.599,00:45:29.268,"No, you look great. Amazing."
00:45:30.018,00:45:32.604,"Well, good, 'cause Michael B. Jordan's coming over tonight."
00:45:34.189,00:45:35.065,Here?
00:45:35.149,00:45:37.109,-You gotta be out of here by 5:00. -Okay.
00:45:37.192,00:45:40.070,And can you get me everything off the Jon &amp; Vinny's menu?
00:45:40.154,00:45:41.488,"The dessert section, too?"
00:45:42.823,00:45:43.907,I don't eat dessert.
00:45:44.741,00:45:45.701,Okay.
00:45:46.702,00:45:50.998,Can you make sure the sexecology oil is upstairs in my bathroom?
00:46:13.437,00:46:15.731,"Yeah, right there."
00:46:26.158,00:46:27.075,What's that?
00:46:28.744,00:46:29.703,"Oh, my God!"
00:46:30.454,00:46:32.498,"I'm really, really so sorry about your face."
00:46:33.207,00:46:36.919,But let's just be honest and say that that wasn't really the best place to sit.
00:46:40.547,00:46:41.507,Who's that?
00:46:43.133,00:46:45.093,"My dad, David Cliff, Sr."
00:46:46.386,00:46:47.596,-Yeah. -Wow.
00:46:47.679,00:46:48.931,Sax player.
00:46:49.431,00:46:51.099,He plays better than anyone else I know.
00:46:51.934,00:46:53.352,"So, you said your mom was a singer?"
00:46:53.435,00:46:56.146,"Well, she was. She died when I was six."
00:46:56.230,00:46:58.023,"-Oh, I'm sorry. -That's okay."
00:46:58.106,00:47:02.736,She met my dad backstage at a Paul Simon concert.
00:47:03.237,00:47:05.906,My dad was there covering the show for work.
00:47:06.156,00:47:11.036,"And they met and then she moved in with him the next day, and they got married a month later."
00:47:11.328,00:47:12.454,Pretty crazy.
00:47:13.121,00:47:14.122,Not that crazy.
00:47:15.415,00:47:16.708,What about your mom and dad?
00:47:17.668,00:47:19.086,Never married.
00:47:19.211,00:47:22.256,"My mom, she left me with my dad when I was little."
00:47:23.632,00:47:26.134,And it was complicated.
00:47:26.635,00:47:27.678,I don't know.
00:47:28.637,00:47:30.055,"My dad's cool, though."
00:47:30.222,00:47:35.060,"Pissed I don't play sax, but, you know, he's there for me. Yeah."
00:47:35.394,00:47:36.979,How's your head? Let's see.
00:47:39.189,00:47:40.148,"Ooh, what?"
00:47:40.232,00:47:41.984,"-Are you laughing at me? -Oh, man."
00:47:42.401,00:47:44.528,"This is my moneymaker, so I don't get what's funny."
00:47:47.030,00:47:51.577,"So, composing major, can you play?"
00:47:51.660,00:47:52.786,This keyboard?
00:47:52.953,00:47:54.162,Whichever one you like.
00:47:55.080,00:48:04.715,"Typically, I'm just… I'm in the studio, I'm behind the boards, and I allow, you know, the artist to create."
00:48:05.257,00:48:06.633,-So… -F.
00:48:07.843,00:48:08.927,Uh-huh. To E minor.
00:48:11.722,00:48:13.348,"-That? -Yeah, like that."
00:48:14.308,00:48:25.402,So it's just… Yeah.
00:48:25.736,00:48:26.820,Uh-huh.
00:48:27.946,00:48:29.573,"-Oh, shit. -Hey."
00:48:30.157,00:48:31.575,Stop interrupting yourself.
00:48:36.330,00:48:43.462,"Okay. It was… -Uh… That? -No, but I like that."
00:48:43.670,00:48:46.214,"Do it fast like that again. Yeah, punch it. Punch it more."
00:48:48.300,00:48:49.259,Yeah.
00:48:52.304,00:48:57.142,And then what about… All right.
00:48:57.684,00:48:59.102,Sing it a little.
00:49:10.030,00:49:12.032,-That sounds good. -Sounds sexy. Yeah.
00:49:12.115,00:49:13.742,Can we do it again?
00:49:13.825,00:49:15.410,"-Yeah, we can do it again. -Okay."
00:49:31.635,00:49:37.599,"So, Thursday when we record, I have these really incredible-- I can't. Playing a bat mitzvah."
00:49:38.225,00:49:39.726,-What? -What?
00:49:39.810,00:49:42.270,"I don't… David, I don't understand."
00:49:42.604,00:49:46.817,"Clearly, you're not doing these gigs for money. I don't… I made a commitment."
00:49:47.651,00:49:50.737,Okay. I'm not gonna beg you to take this seriously.
00:49:51.530,00:49:52.614,Don't beg me.
00:49:52.698,00:49:55.492,"David, you have an incredible voice."
00:49:57.661,00:50:08.088,"When you sing, it's restrained and impassioned and nostalgic, and… people outside of various LA community centers should hear it."
00:50:08.171,00:50:09.464,But what if I'm not good enough?
00:50:09.548,00:50:10.424,What?
00:50:10.507,00:50:15.387,"What if I'm just some douchebag who thought he could be a singer like everybody else, and then what?"
00:50:16.471,00:50:17.973,Then what am I supposed to do?
00:50:20.809,00:50:21.768,"Oh, my God."
00:50:22.102,00:50:23.061,What?
00:50:23.145,00:50:24.479,You're insecure.
00:50:29.484,00:50:35.824,"I'm coming at you with some deep-seated anxiety right now, and… No. You're just self-sabotaging, and I can work with that."
00:50:37.909,00:50:38.869,Sorry.
00:50:40.537,00:50:41.913,Hello? Hello?
00:50:42.581,00:50:46.126,"Oh, okay. I-- Yes, I'll be right there. Okay."
00:50:48.587,00:50:51.715,"That was another client, so I have to go."
00:50:52.924,00:50:53.884,You're amazing.
00:50:53.967,00:50:56.511,And I will see you soon.
00:50:56.595,00:50:59.097,-And we will continue this conversation. -Yes.
00:50:59.347,00:51:00.265,"Okay, bye."
00:51:01.641,00:51:02.726,"Good night, Maggie."
00:51:03.727,00:51:05.645,Thank you. Very nice.
00:51:08.440,00:51:09.399,Wait.
00:51:09.983,00:51:11.568,Is this your car?
00:51:12.027,00:51:13.779,Why do people keep asking me that? Yeah.
00:51:13.862,00:51:17.032,You need to ask your boss for a raise.
00:51:20.494,00:51:23.580,That's so funny. Do you get it? Because I'm your boss!
00:51:26.583,00:51:27.626,Do you get it?
00:51:28.418,00:51:30.754,"Wait. Pull over. Right here, right here, right here."
00:51:30.837,00:51:33.715,"Hey. Can I get two carnitas, please?"
00:51:34.591,00:51:38.512,"And one of them should be chicken, with hot sauce."
00:51:39.721,00:51:54.569,"So, Michael B. Jordan insisted that we leave my house and go to a hotel, because he had this whole proposal planned."
00:51:55.362,00:51:58.615,We have very different problems.
00:51:58.740,00:52:00.575,"What are your problems, Margaret?"
00:52:00.742,00:52:04.246,"Well, I mean… -I'm hungry. -Oh."
00:52:04.329,00:52:05.789,-I'm so hungry. -Okay.
00:52:05.872,00:52:07.707,"Is the food coming, sir?"
00:52:09.501,00:52:11.419,We are not a drive-through.
00:52:12.087,00:52:15.006,"Okay, well, it should be. It could be."
00:52:15.090,00:52:16.800,"Oh, my God. Is that Grace Davis?"
00:52:16.883,00:52:17.801,-Hi. -No.
00:52:17.884,00:52:19.845,"-Hi, I love you so much. -I love you."
00:52:19.928,00:52:21.805,-Can I take a picture with you? -I know.
00:52:21.888,00:52:22.973,Sure. Yeah.
00:52:25.267,00:52:26.852,Hi. This isn't my car.
00:52:26.935,00:52:27.853,Hello.
00:52:30.230,00:52:32.732,"-Okay. One, two, hi, Grace Davis! -Hi!"
00:52:35.610,00:52:37.112,So glad I called you.
00:52:42.284,00:52:45.704,It's after ten o'clock. Miss Gail is passed out.
00:52:47.414,00:52:54.838,"Anyway, I thought you would enjoy this time with me 'cause you're always hanging around me, just hanging around me."
00:52:55.881,00:52:57.591,That's my job.
00:52:57.757,00:52:58.842,You know what I mean.
00:53:02.971,00:53:04.264,Would you get married?
00:53:05.390,00:53:08.226,"Oh, my God. Not you, too."
00:53:09.227,00:53:13.982,"I know that everybody wonders, Is Grace gonna find a man?"
00:53:14.149,00:53:18.320,I mean… Who's gonna put a ring on it?
00:53:19.112,00:53:20.280,You know what?
00:53:21.990,00:53:23.366,I'm happy with me.
00:53:24.784,00:53:26.786,I am happy with me.
00:53:26.953,00:53:27.913,Yup.
00:53:30.498,00:53:35.795,"I just thought that maybe if you were gonna do anybody the favor, then it may as well be Michael B. Jordan."
00:53:36.838,00:53:38.048,I almost did.
00:53:39.591,00:53:40.550,Once.
00:53:41.843,00:53:43.637,-Really? -Yeah.
00:53:45.430,00:53:48.892,But I was too young.
00:53:54.648,00:53:58.693,We were in love and the whole thing.
00:54:02.405,00:54:04.324,It was before all this happened.
00:54:08.161,00:54:09.287,Then it did.
00:54:11.164,00:54:12.666,And I didn't choose him.
00:54:14.793,00:54:15.752,Obviously.
00:54:17.504,00:54:18.880,I didn't want it.
00:54:20.632,00:54:21.800,I don't want it.
00:54:23.426,00:54:26.304,I chose those countertops in the bathroom.
00:54:26.513,00:54:30.016,"They were like, You can have two sinks. And I was like, No."
00:54:35.146,00:54:37.065,-It is a very big sink. -Mm-hmm.
00:54:40.318,00:54:41.736,What's happening?
00:54:44.239,00:54:46.032,Why are you all dressed up?
00:54:47.742,00:54:56.793,"Why did you have to steal from the needy and take this $3,000 Saint Laurent jacket?"
00:55:04.926,00:55:05.969,Okay. Okay.
00:55:11.474,00:55:14.269,Does he know who I am?
00:55:17.814,00:55:20.775,"Well, he lives on Earth, so, yeah."
00:55:21.693,00:55:22.944,"Listen to me, Margaret."
00:55:24.487,00:55:26.698,I am a very big draw.
00:55:26.781,00:55:27.866,Okay?
00:55:27.949,00:55:32.579,"So you… you make sure he's with you for you, okay?"
00:55:33.371,00:55:35.040,-Okay. -Okay.
00:55:35.123,00:55:36.291,Thank you.
00:56:08.865,00:56:11.701,There's no band. It's just you. No pressure. Okay?
00:56:11.785,00:56:12.994,Mm-hmm.
00:56:13.078,00:56:14.871,Just pretend you're at a bat mitzvah.
00:56:15.205,00:56:16.289,Mm.
00:56:38.186,00:56:40.146,"Yeah, yeah. It's totally fine. We got all night."
00:56:43.691,00:56:44.734,…if that's cool?
00:56:45.902,00:56:46.861,Thanks.
00:56:58.039,00:57:03.795,Sorry. I feel like… You just gotta loosen up a little bit. You're gonna get there.
00:57:04.838,00:57:06.047,I'm gonna come in.
00:57:06.756,00:57:07.715,I'm going in.
00:57:12.512,00:57:13.471,You okay?
00:57:14.681,00:57:16.224,"-Yeah, I'm good. -Yeah."
00:57:17.767,00:57:20.728,"-It's really beautiful in here, isn't it? -Yeah."
00:57:20.937,00:57:23.189,Did you know that that was Sam Cooke's original mic?
00:57:24.566,00:57:26.109,-Are you serious? -Yeah.
00:57:26.192,00:57:28.903,"Yeah, Seth and I found it at an auction last year."
00:57:54.137,00:57:56.639,Have you ever heard that live recording that he does?
00:57:58.266,00:57:59.309,Yeah. Have you heard it?
00:57:59.392,00:58:15.158,"Yeah, when he's like… -You wanna go again? -All right. I'm down."
00:58:15.241,00:58:16.409,-Okay. -Cool.
00:58:23.416,00:58:24.542,You wanna try one?
00:58:24.626,00:58:25.585,Okay.
00:59:51.004,00:59:52.005,Beautiful.
00:59:53.923,00:59:55.466,Was that really Sam Cooke's mic?
00:59:55.550,00:59:56.509,No.
00:59:57.760,00:59:59.137,-Can I hear that again? -Mm-hmm.
01:00:24.996,01:00:25.955,I'm sorry.
01:00:26.956,01:00:27.915,I'm sorry.
01:00:55.610,01:00:57.570,That's so good.
01:00:57.654,01:00:58.946,"Oh, my God."
01:00:59.614,01:01:01.366,Sea Dust.
01:01:06.663,01:01:11.334,"Um, no big deal or anything, just your girl doing open-heart surgery."
01:01:14.379,01:01:16.756,"'Kay, cool. Sorry. Back to your art."
01:01:20.301,01:01:22.303,Everything we do is meaningless.
01:01:32.980,01:01:36.901,"Did you know the guy who produced this song also did Bills, Bills, Bills for Destiny's Child?"
01:01:36.984,01:01:37.860,I did know that.
01:01:37.944,01:01:40.279,And did you know that he also did a Sinéad O'Connor song?
01:01:40.363,01:01:44.409,Did you know that I wanna hear the song on the radio?
01:01:44.492,01:01:45.410,Sorry.
01:01:45.493,01:01:47.745,"Yeah. Thanks, Margaret. Let's sing it!"
01:02:14.313,01:02:15.732,Grace Davis!
01:02:19.193,01:02:20.445,"-How are ya? Hi. -Hey, hey."
01:02:23.781,01:02:25.825,-Can I get you something to drink? -No. I'm fine.
01:02:25.908,01:02:27.243,"Margaret, you want something? No?"
01:02:27.326,01:02:28.786,Sparkling? Still?
01:02:29.495,01:02:30.997,"Well, Grace, thanks for coming in."
01:02:32.165,01:02:33.958,This is Spencer. He's on national press.
01:02:34.208,01:02:35.084,"Hi, Spencer."
01:02:35.168,01:02:39.756,Can I just say my mom's more excited about me working with you than when I graduated Stanford.
01:02:39.922,01:02:41.257,"What was that, like, a week ago?"
01:02:42.800,01:02:44.051,I told you she was hilarious.
01:02:48.765,01:02:51.893,"Baby, we are so excited about your live album release party next week."
01:02:52.101,01:02:54.771,"Ugh, we're thrilled you okayed Ariana Grande to open for you."
01:02:54.854,01:02:55.855,She's amazing.
01:02:56.355,01:02:57.523,"Her mom loves you, too."
01:02:59.108,01:03:00.318,No more mom stuff.
01:03:01.235,01:03:04.614,"You guys didn't bring me all the way down here so you could tell me that, did you?"
01:03:09.285,01:03:13.498,"Once the live album is out, we want to make sure we think through your next moves."
01:03:13.664,01:03:15.041,"Yeah, what do you want to do next?"
01:03:16.125,01:03:24.842,"Well, um… I've been thinking, and… I think it's time I record a new album."
01:03:33.392,01:03:35.436,"Well, I mean, that's one plan."
01:03:37.480,01:03:43.694,"Uh, we've talked about a few different things, and we really wanna know what you wanna do."
01:03:43.778,01:03:47.615,"I mean, where do you envision Grace Davis in the future?"
01:03:49.992,01:03:52.328,Have you thought any more about the Vegas residency?
01:03:52.411,01:03:53.996,"We talked about Vegas, remember?"
01:04:09.971,01:04:11.722,At least I can get a damn drink somewhere.
01:04:12.932,01:04:15.226,-Price of one. -We'll get you a damn drink.
01:04:16.853,01:04:19.105,"If you want, I can show you the slideshow I put together?"
01:04:30.992,01:04:32.285,I don't wanna talk about it.
01:04:37.623,01:04:39.125,I thought you didn't wanna do Vegas.
01:04:39.625,01:04:41.335,I said I didn't wanna talk about it.
01:04:42.128,01:04:43.713,It's a big commitment.
01:04:45.339,01:04:48.926,You heard what they said. It's not the same as it used to be.
01:04:51.846,01:04:52.763,Yeah.
01:04:52.847,01:04:54.432,Some of their ideas weren't terrible.
01:04:54.515,01:04:58.728,Yeah. I think a Spotify-curated Christmas album could be super cool.
01:04:58.936,01:05:00.730,"Okay, just say it, all right?"
01:05:00.813,01:05:02.815,I get it. I know what you're thinking.
01:05:03.024,01:05:05.943,I'm a sellout. I get it. That was humiliating. Yup.
01:05:06.027,01:05:07.612,-You got to witness it. -What? No.
01:05:07.820,01:05:08.821,It's fantastic.
01:05:08.905,01:05:20.833,"That's not what… Grace, those pretentious sparkling-water blowhards just spoke to you like they forgot that you basically built this entire label for them."
01:05:20.917,01:05:23.210,-They were just trying to help me. -What?
01:05:23.544,01:05:26.255,"You've got, like, years of career moves ahead of you."
01:05:26.339,01:05:29.258,"If you wanna do Vegas, then fine, do Vegas."
01:05:29.592,01:05:32.053,But don't do it like it's your farewell tour.
01:05:32.261,01:05:35.222,It's not over for you. You said it in there. You said it.
01:05:35.306,01:05:37.600,A new album. That is what you should be doing.
01:05:37.934,01:05:40.436,Do you know what they were avoiding saying in there?
01:05:40.519,01:05:41.520,What?
01:05:41.604,01:05:49.570,"In the history of music, only five women over 40 have ever had a number-one hit."
01:05:50.029,01:05:51.614,And only one of them was Black.
01:05:51.822,01:05:53.240,One.
01:05:53.324,01:05:55.117,Do you understand that?
01:05:55.451,01:05:56.911,No.
01:05:56.994,01:05:59.163,You do not understand that.
01:05:59.246,01:06:02.833,And none of you guys in there understand what I have been through.
01:06:05.252,01:06:07.880,"So, I don't know. We could just pretend."
01:06:07.964,01:06:15.137,"We could pretend that we live in some sort of magical world where, I don't know, let's see, age and race are not a thing."
01:06:15.221,01:06:16.931,Then do you know what the problem is?
01:06:17.348,01:06:25.606,"I, not the label, not Jack, not you, have to come up with shit that people give a shit about, and I don't know how to do that anymore!"
01:06:25.690,01:06:27.650,I don't know if I know how to do that.
01:06:30.194,01:06:31.821,"Oh, my God."
01:06:33.531,01:06:34.657,I know you've been writing.
01:06:34.740,01:06:35.783,What?
01:06:36.117,01:06:38.327,"-I'm sorry, what? -Oh, no, no, no."
01:06:38.411,01:06:39.912,Have you been going through my stuff?
01:06:39.996,01:06:42.081,-No. That's not what I did. -You know what? No. No.
01:06:45.042,01:06:46.585,I am not here for you.
01:06:47.336,01:06:49.088,You are here for me.
01:06:49.296,01:06:51.257,I am not your stepping stone.
01:06:51.590,01:06:54.093,"You're not a producer, Margaret."
01:06:54.176,01:06:57.555,"I didn't ask you to produce my song. And I'm not gonna say thank you, either."
01:06:59.015,01:07:02.476,You're an encyclopedia. You memorize trivia.
01:07:02.560,01:07:04.395,You handle my itinerary.
01:07:05.479,01:07:08.607,You pick peanuts out of kung pao chicken.
01:07:08.691,01:07:11.402,You're not the ticket to people's breakthrough.
01:07:11.736,01:07:12.695,Okay?
01:07:13.779,01:07:18.784,"And those guys in there, they're way better than you, because they were setting me up for an easy win."
01:07:18.868,01:07:21.871,"And you, little lady, are setting me up for a fail. Thank you."
01:07:42.808,01:07:43.809,You're late.
01:07:45.644,01:07:47.688,"I mean, what's up, Mags? We doing this or what?"
01:07:54.779,01:08:10.169,"Uh, why don't we just take it from, um… Fuck."
01:08:19.595,01:08:20.554,Maggie.
01:08:23.724,01:08:24.767,What was that?
01:08:27.520,01:08:28.854,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay."
01:08:28.938,01:08:30.147,You okay?
01:08:32.233,01:08:33.192,Okay.
01:08:33.901,01:08:34.944,"Okay, what's wrong?"
01:08:35.528,01:08:36.570,Nothing.
01:08:37.488,01:08:38.572,Nothing?
01:08:41.367,01:08:42.660,-Yeah? -Yeah.
01:08:42.743,01:08:43.661,Okay.
01:08:43.744,01:08:45.371,-All right. Okay. -Mm-hmm.
01:08:48.124,01:08:49.917,Do you not want to do this anymore?
01:08:51.544,01:08:54.421,Is that what's wrong? Do you not… Is that what it is?
01:08:56.173,01:08:57.133,No.
01:08:57.216,01:08:58.467,No?
01:08:58.551,01:09:01.387,"No, no. I mean, no, I want this more than anything."
01:09:07.935,01:09:09.270,I don't know what I'm doing.
01:09:10.896,01:09:11.981,You don't?
01:09:12.314,01:09:13.274,Mm-mm.
01:09:14.608,01:09:25.119,"You sure freaked out James when you told him if he didn't get his tuning right, you was gonna run over him, so… Look, Maggie, you got all of us in that room. Okay?"
01:09:25.953,01:09:27.621,I know it wasn't easy.
01:09:28.080,01:09:34.378,"You've got that drummer in there, and I don't know where he came from, but he's, like… I think he's big time. You know?"
01:09:35.129,01:09:36.255,-Yeah. -Yeah.
01:09:38.340,01:09:39.925,So you know what you like.
01:09:41.844,01:09:43.429,That's what makes you great.
01:09:47.266,01:09:48.601,Just glad I made the cut.
01:09:50.436,01:09:53.772,Well… barely.
01:09:58.652,01:10:01.113,Did you come up with that guitar riff in there?
01:10:01.947,01:10:02.907,Yeah.
01:10:03.866,01:10:04.867,It's pretty good.
01:10:05.993,01:10:08.204,I'm pretty good. I did it last night. It was easy.
01:10:09.705,01:10:13.042,-You could tighten it up. Okay? -Okay. Okay.
01:10:41.987,01:10:43.113,Whoo!
01:10:43.197,01:10:45.991,Yes. Yes. Yes. That's what I'm talking about.
01:10:46.075,01:10:47.451,"Oh, my God, y'all are good."
01:10:49.078,01:10:51.121,"Okay, let's stop for a second."
01:10:52.373,01:10:53.749,"Something's off, yeah?"
01:10:55.918,01:10:59.338,"I feel like it needs some, like, layers, you know?"
01:10:59.421,01:11:01.131,"-A little bit of warmth, and… -Yeah."
01:11:01.215,01:11:04.593,"Um, maybe some harmonies. I can get some backup singers."
01:11:05.094,01:11:08.847,Can you do it? We could always replace it. I just want to hear it right now.
01:11:08.931,01:11:12.101,I can have somebody here in an hour. We'll just-- Maggie.
01:11:14.353,01:11:15.354,David.
01:11:19.692,01:11:21.568,"We wrote the song, right?"
01:11:21.944,01:11:24.697,We've done it a hundred times. Just come on and do it. It'll be fun.
01:11:24.780,01:11:27.700,"This is my area, and that's your area."
01:11:27.783,01:11:29.910,"-So, nope. -Maggie, please."
01:11:29.994,01:11:32.037,"Don't push me, David."
01:11:32.121,01:11:33.497,Come on.
01:11:33.706,01:11:35.040,"Oh, my God. No."
01:12:04.153,01:12:05.404,"-All right, bye. -Thank you."
01:12:07.531,01:12:08.782,-All right. Peace. -Thank you.
01:12:08.866,01:12:10.409,"-Have a good one, man. -You, too."
01:12:10.492,01:12:11.994,"-Bye, Seth. -Bye."
01:12:12.202,01:12:13.287,You're the best.
01:12:15.039,01:12:16.540,Love that guy.
01:12:16.623,01:12:18.459,-He's pretty good. -Good guy.
01:12:18.709,01:12:19.752,Yeah.
01:12:19.960,01:12:25.090,"You're not too bad, right? A little bit of… -Oh. Wow. Yup, and it… -Bada… boom."
01:12:39.897,01:12:40.939,Okay.
01:12:41.857,01:12:43.233,Okay.
01:12:43.692,01:12:51.658,"So, that was a great session, and I think that everyone feels -very good about it. -Mm-hmm."
01:12:51.742,01:12:53.118,"So, I'll e-mail you."
01:12:54.995,01:12:58.582,And… we will chat soon.
01:13:09.093,01:13:10.344,What?
01:13:11.220,01:13:12.262,"Oh, God."
01:13:13.055,01:13:14.014,No.
01:13:17.184,01:13:20.145,We have a problem with the release party. Ariana can't perform.
01:13:20.229,01:13:27.778,"She's trying to finish a six-part album, and she won't leave the studio, What about what's his face?"
01:13:27.861,01:13:30.489,-The guy who hit on us at the Grammys? -He hit on you.
01:13:30.572,01:13:31.824,-The Weeknd? -That one. Yes.
01:13:31.907,01:13:34.118,"He is on tour in Europe. And also, he has a girlfriend."
01:13:34.451,01:13:36.954,"Okay, great. Well, let me just do your job for you."
01:13:37.037,01:13:39.039,-Taylor Swift. -She's writing a memoir.
01:13:41.166,01:13:42.918,-Do I need to lecture you… -No.
01:13:43.001,01:13:47.714,…on the importance of an opener for an album release?
01:13:51.427,01:13:55.889,"Okay, Margaret, I'm not gonna come out there to a cold crowd like an amateur."
01:13:55.973,01:13:57.391,You have totally screwed this up.
01:13:57.474,01:14:02.729,And I have noticed that you have not been focused on your job over the last few weeks.
01:14:02.813,01:14:05.315,-I've noticed that. -I'll fix it.
01:14:05.482,01:14:07.943,Because scheduling is in my very limited wheelhouse.
01:14:08.026,01:14:11.155,"Well, then, why don't you find someone who's not gonna embarrass me?"
01:14:11.947,01:14:14.032,-I will. -Great. Thank you.
01:14:14.741,01:14:17.369,-It'd be nice if you could do your job. -Dan would love to do it.
01:14:20.080,01:14:21.874,"Hey, it's me. Can I come up?"
01:14:24.751,01:14:26.336,-No. -Then no.
01:14:27.796,01:14:30.299,"Oh! Hey, David. You wanna come in?"
01:14:30.549,01:14:32.176,Is she gonna say it's not a good idea?
01:14:35.220,01:14:36.054,Yeah. Forget it.
01:14:36.138,01:14:40.851,"…and not be blurring the lines, and, you know… -I let him up. -What?"
01:14:43.687,01:14:47.524,"Okay, listen. Brian Epstein did not sleep with The Beatles."
01:14:47.649,01:14:49.526,Jerry Wexler and Aretha? No.
01:14:49.610,01:14:52.029,Jimmy Iovine and Springsteen? No.
01:14:52.112,01:14:54.323,"Actually, he did have a whole thing with Stevie Nicks."
01:14:54.406,01:14:58.076,"Anyway, David Geffen… also had a thing with Cher."
01:14:58.660,01:15:10.297,"And people do think that Brian Epstein was in love with John Lennon, so there's… This is not… I'm not… You should… I think you should go."
01:15:10.672,01:15:12.633,-Cher's amazing. -Mm-hmm.
01:15:12.716,01:15:13.717,So sexy.
01:15:15.260,01:15:17.721,Have you ever heard her version of All I Really Want to Do?
01:16:03.934,01:16:04.851,Hello?
01:16:08.230,01:16:09.898,"Yeah, yeah. Of course I did. Yeah."
01:16:09.982,01:16:12.401,"When was you gonna tell me, huh? He better be there."
01:16:16.697,01:16:17.656,Okay.
01:16:22.828,01:16:24.204,What are you doing on Friday?
01:16:24.997,01:16:26.498,Hopefully this again.
01:16:30.836,01:16:32.421,Hi. It's Maggie.
01:16:36.133,01:16:39.261,"Well, that's what I was calling to talk to you about. Do you have a quick sec?"
01:16:39.344,01:16:44.099,I'm actually waiting on him to get out of a meeting right now. So… Oh. A meeting. Really?
01:16:46.768,01:16:49.438,-Maggie? How did you know we were here? -Please.
01:16:49.521,01:16:52.649,Everybody knows this is the first place he comes when he comes to LA.
01:16:53.358,01:16:55.152,How long have you been Dan's assistant?
01:16:55.235,01:16:56.820,"-Like, five years? -Yeah."
01:16:56.903,01:16:59.573,Have you ever wanted to do something other than be his assistant?
01:16:59.906,01:17:03.410,"Well, between you and me, I've been working on a screenplay."
01:17:03.493,01:17:05.412,"It's 200 pages, but I'm confident."
01:17:05.495,01:17:06.788,-It's hilarious. -Great. Yeah.
01:17:06.872,01:17:11.209,"So, what would you do to get, like, I don't know, Spielberg to read it?"
01:17:14.338,01:17:18.717,"So, I've been working with this really incredible artist on the side without Grace knowing."
01:17:18.800,01:17:30.437,"And I know that Dan has already committed to doing the party on Friday, but I need you to help me Ocean's Eleven this whole thing and get him to drop out at the last minute, so then I can swoop in and I can get my artist heard by Grace and the label."
01:17:30.520,01:17:37.235,"Then everyone is gonna lose their minds, clearly, like I've lost my mind, and I'm gonna change the trajectory of our entire lives."
01:17:37.819,01:17:38.904,Roll credits.
01:17:40.030,01:17:41.448,I love Ocean's Eleven.
01:17:47.412,01:17:48.246,Hey.
01:17:50.415,01:17:51.750,Let me hear him.
01:18:13.230,01:18:15.190,All right. I'm in.
01:18:15.273,01:18:16.733,Shut up.
01:18:16.817,01:18:19.236,"It'll piss off Grace, but she needs a kick in the ass."
01:18:19.653,01:18:22.614,Sure you're ready for this? Working with musicians?
01:18:23.573,01:18:28.245,"People like me, Grace, this kid. Crazy little gods."
01:18:29.746,01:18:34.209,"Before you know it, you'll be on tour when you're supposed to be best man at your brother's wedding."
01:18:34.793,01:18:37.045,Or in the studio when your kid's winning the nationals.
01:18:37.129,01:18:39.923,Or buying another Rolls-Royce when you've already got three.
01:18:40.841,01:18:41.883,"No, four."
01:18:43.009,01:18:43.844,Yes.
01:18:44.302,01:18:51.601,"Then you realize, Damn, I'm writing lyrics on a napkin in a toilet, and I'm supposed to be at the reception for my fourth wedding."
01:18:52.602,01:18:54.312,"No, fifth wedding."
01:19:03.905,01:19:04.865,I do.
01:19:05.824,01:19:07.492,And you think you can handle that?
01:19:07.576,01:19:08.535,I do.
01:19:09.536,01:19:11.538,And do you want it more than blood?
01:19:12.748,01:19:13.749,I do.
01:19:16.334,01:19:19.087,Send me the rest of his stuff. I want to play it in the car.
01:19:39.524,01:19:41.735,"Here's pictures of me and Shwayze, man."
01:19:41.943,01:19:43.528,This girl right here can sing!
01:19:43.862,01:19:47.240,"Make sure you tag me in that, girl. Instagram, all them 'grams you got."
01:19:48.533,01:19:49.618,I'm the star now!
01:19:49.951,01:19:51.703,"And which is my better side, Jack?"
01:19:53.914,01:19:55.791,-This shit is confusing. -Jack. Hi. Sorry.
01:19:55.874,01:19:57.501,Can I just get a quick… One sec.
01:19:57.584,01:19:59.961,"Yeah. Thank you, 'cause he talking about VR."
01:20:00.420,01:20:02.589,Why can't people just take shrooms like they used to?
01:20:02.923,01:20:05.717,Um… Dan is a no-go.
01:20:06.843,01:20:07.803,What?
01:20:07.886,01:20:11.223,Yeah. He's not able to make it.
01:20:11.306,01:20:13.183,"So, I have a plan B."
01:20:14.142,01:20:16.520,-You said you was gonna handle this. -I am. Trust me.
01:20:17.771,01:20:18.730,Where's your guitar?
01:20:18.814,01:20:20.899,In the car. I thought we were going to dinner.
01:20:20.982,01:20:22.984,"-Why this one? Oh, God. -What? Why not?"
01:20:23.068,01:20:27.155,Okay. I'm gonna need you to fight the urge to get really mad at me right now.
01:20:27.239,01:20:28.698,"Okay. I mean, what's going on?"
01:20:28.782,01:20:32.869,"Um… Well, there's been a little change of plans."
01:20:33.453,01:20:37.958,First of all… I'm not a producer.
01:20:38.041,01:20:41.044,"-What? -I mean, I am, but I'm not a real one."
01:20:42.003,01:20:43.421,I'm a personal assistant.
01:20:43.964,01:20:53.640,"I'm an assistant to a big-time singer who is having a big party tonight, and her whole label is gonna be there and a lot of other music people, and you're gonna sing for them."
01:20:55.809,01:20:57.310,"That's good, right?"
01:20:57.811,01:21:01.064,You're… You're an assistant?
01:21:02.732,01:21:07.279,"Yeah, I am. I'm an assistant, too. But my boss, Grace Davis, is awesome."
01:21:07.404,01:21:08.905,You work for Grace Davis?
01:21:09.489,01:21:10.490,Yeah.
01:21:13.910,01:21:15.161,Wow.
01:21:15.245,01:21:16.705,"David! Hey, wait!"
01:21:16.788,01:21:18.206,Does she know about this?
01:21:19.791,01:21:21.585,"No, not yet. But she's gonna love you."
01:21:22.002,01:21:25.046,"Do you even have any clients? I mean, did you lie about that, too?"
01:21:27.090,01:21:28.508,"Oh, my God."
01:21:29.509,01:21:37.726,"I'm sorry. I should have told you. And I'm sorry that I… But we can talk about all of this later-- You know, you're so arrogant."
01:21:38.852,01:21:41.062,You don't know shit. You don't know anything.
01:21:41.146,01:21:43.231,You just walk around pretending. Who does that?
01:21:43.315,01:21:46.943,"I'm sorry I lied to you. It was wrong, but we made something really good."
01:21:47.068,01:21:50.280,And it deserves a shot. I think you deserve a shot.
01:21:50.363,01:21:52.365,"What's in there, that could change your whole life!"
01:21:52.449,01:21:53.950,It could change both of our lives.
01:21:54.034,01:21:55.827,"I'm not your escape plan, Maggie."
01:21:58.413,01:22:02.459,That's not what I… David!
01:22:03.209,01:22:04.794,And I love this jacket.
01:22:23.313,01:22:24.856,Did you figure it out?
01:22:27.233,01:22:28.735,This was your second chance.
01:22:30.028,01:22:31.655,You couldn't handle it.
01:22:32.489,01:22:33.823,You wanna be a producer?
01:22:35.867,01:22:43.124,Producing is about trust and commitment and taking care of your artist.
01:22:44.960,01:22:46.878,You couldn't even do that as an assistant.
01:22:47.629,01:22:51.508,Why would I want to work with you? Why would anyone want to work with you?
01:22:55.136,01:22:56.304,We're done.
01:23:00.100,01:23:01.434,"Thanks, Jack."
01:23:05.230,01:23:09.526,"If you need a reference for your next job, have 'em give me a call."
01:23:10.777,01:23:12.153,I got a lot to say.
01:23:16.658,01:23:18.076,"Hello, everyone."
01:23:19.035,01:23:20.120,How are you?
01:23:22.455,01:23:25.208,"So, it looks like I'll be opening for myself tonight."
01:23:35.552,01:23:38.304,"Hey, I'm sorry today was such a shit day."
01:23:39.055,01:23:41.433,I opened the Adele basket.
01:23:41.850,01:23:42.809,Okay.
01:23:56.948,01:23:58.074,I would never leave you.
01:23:59.367,01:24:00.326,What am I saying?
01:24:01.411,01:24:04.456,"No, we were all meant to be together! Come on."
01:24:06.207,01:24:07.709,We're going home.
01:25:05.266,01:25:14.484,"And that is the late, great Donny Hathaway doing John Lennon's Jealous Guy… Live at The Bitter End."
01:25:14.567,01:25:16.653,…live at The Bitter End.
01:25:18.780,01:25:20.115,"Hey, Magpie."
01:25:20.448,01:25:21.449,"Hi, Dad."
01:25:25.870,01:25:28.915,"Just a few things, then we'll be home."
01:25:29.791,01:25:31.084,What do you have to do?
01:25:33.545,01:25:34.504,All right.
01:25:51.146,01:25:53.648,What do we need? Want to order some pizza?
01:26:20.216,01:26:22.468,"Hey, Maggie."
01:26:22.552,01:26:24.304,I gotta do the morning show.
01:26:27.140,01:26:28.099,No.
01:26:28.933,01:26:30.685,What?
01:26:31.603,01:26:33.521,It's the singer-songwriter hour.
01:26:33.605,01:26:35.899,Gonna start with Joni Mitchell.
01:26:36.816,01:26:39.277,You know what album I'm thinking of?
01:26:40.653,01:26:41.613,Guess.
01:26:42.739,01:26:45.283,Was she dating David Crosby or Jackson Browne?
01:26:45.950,01:26:47.202,James Taylor.
01:26:48.161,01:26:51.289,My favorite. For the Roses.
01:26:51.372,01:26:53.458,Attagirl.
01:26:55.126,01:27:00.340,"Yeah, it's all about being a rock star, dating a rock star, and heroin."
01:27:01.341,01:27:03.509,I can't believe I let her stay with me this long.
01:27:03.593,01:27:05.428,-She was always in my face. -Mm-hmm.
01:27:05.511,01:27:08.264,Hi. I'm Maggie. I know everything about everything.
01:27:11.267,01:27:14.938,"I can pull off bangs. No, you can't. No, you can't because it's not 1970."
01:27:15.355,01:27:17.690,Hasn't been 1970 for some years.
01:27:17.774,01:27:20.026,"-Oh, my God. Okay. -She's a nightmare person."
01:27:20.109,01:27:21.736,And she's a bummer to be around.
01:27:21.819,01:27:23.696,Why is she always asking if you need water?
01:27:23.780,01:27:24.739,I don't know.
01:27:24.822,01:27:27.575,And she's constantly listening to your songs over and over.
01:27:27.659,01:27:28.743,"Oh, my God."
01:27:31.496,01:27:36.960,"And honestly, Grace, I thought she was gonna be the one who would stick it out. I tried to help her."
01:27:37.043,01:27:39.128,-Did you talk to her? -I did talk to her.
01:27:39.212,01:27:40.171,Okay.
01:27:40.255,01:27:43.841,And I tried to tell her that this was an enormous opportunity.
01:27:44.092,01:27:46.844,And I saw myself in her. You know?
01:27:47.011,01:27:51.140,"Before I became the strong, independent woman that I am today."
01:27:53.434,01:27:56.312,I think she's just obsessed with you.
01:27:56.396,01:27:59.023,"She never asked you for anything, which was weird."
01:27:59.983,01:28:01.818,"-Well, she actually did. -What?"
01:28:01.901,01:28:06.072,"Did she ask you for those Louboutins? Because those are mine, Grace."
01:28:06.322,01:28:09.575,It goes from Grace to Getty Images to Gail.
01:28:10.243,01:28:11.911,"No, she wanted to produce."
01:28:13.705,01:28:14.622,Who?
01:28:18.001,01:28:19.127,Me.
01:28:25.049,01:28:26.217,Why?
01:28:28.761,01:28:29.721,"I mean, you're retired."
01:28:32.765,01:28:33.725,I'm not retired.
01:28:37.812,01:28:39.605,"Yeah, I'm a singer, Gail."
01:28:55.330,01:28:56.789,Is she any good?
01:29:14.682,01:29:15.600,No.
01:29:15.683,01:29:26.569,"Made famous by the one and only Grace Davis, I really don't want to hear this right now."
01:29:26.652,01:29:27.945,Oh!
01:29:28.029,01:29:30.156,"Your mother loved that song, huh?"
01:29:30.239,01:29:32.116,I knew the Grace version.
01:29:32.325,01:29:33.701,Everybody did.
01:29:34.911,01:29:38.164,But she knew all the covers. She was obsessed by 'em.
01:29:39.999,01:29:47.048,"You know the way a song can be one thing when it comes out of somebody's mouth, and then, magic."
01:29:47.757,01:29:50.885,"Suddenly, it belongs to somebody else."
01:29:51.636,01:29:53.262,"You know, it's hard."
01:29:53.346,01:29:59.936,"It's hard for me to think that one day you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna be older than your mother ever was."
01:30:01.145,01:30:02.105,Dad.
01:30:04.232,01:30:15.076,But if she knew that you worked for Grace Davis for two-- She'd have been so proud and jealous.
01:30:15.868,01:30:18.204,And she wouldn't want you hiding out here.
01:30:18.287,01:30:20.373,"Well, I really blew it."
01:30:21.165,01:30:27.255,"But I did learn more than I'll ever learn anywhere else, working for Grace."
01:30:29.048,01:30:32.301,I didn't even know I wanted to be a producer when I started there.
01:30:33.678,01:30:35.972,And what did she say when you told her that?
01:30:36.889,01:30:39.433,"You did tell her that, right?"
01:30:39.684,01:30:42.311,She does not want to talk to me.
01:30:46.023,01:30:47.567,"Maggie, come on."
01:30:47.650,01:30:52.071,"You can wallow around here, or you can try to make things right."
01:30:52.655,01:30:54.157,I'm not wallowing.
01:30:54.240,01:30:55.199,"Well, call her."
01:31:00.580,01:31:02.707,All right. What are you gonna start with tonight?
01:31:03.040,01:31:04.000,Hmm.
01:31:04.333,01:31:05.418,Maybe this one.
01:31:05.501,01:31:08.379,Nope. Uh… Please.
01:31:08.754,01:31:11.090,Not Landslide by the Dixie Chicks.
01:31:11.424,01:31:13.009,It's a great song.
01:31:14.552,01:31:15.511,No.
01:31:16.596,01:31:19.599,"Good evening, this is Maggie Sherwoode."
01:31:19.891,01:31:23.102,I will be covering for Don for the next couple weeks.
01:31:23.936,01:31:31.652,"I'm gonna kick it off with three different versions of The First Cut Is the Deepest, originally by Cat-Yusuf Stevens."
01:31:36.949,01:31:38.492,Jesus Christ.
01:31:53.466,01:31:54.467,"Oh, no."
01:32:10.816,01:32:12.360,I'm gonna call her.
01:32:12.568,01:32:13.694,Okay.
01:32:14.403,01:32:16.864,-Where's my cart? -It's a long story.
01:32:17.198,01:32:18.115,It died.
01:32:18.741,01:32:22.536,"Hi, Grace. It's Maggie… Margaret Sherwoode."
01:32:23.204,01:32:28.459,Um… I'm sorry about the party.
01:32:28.542,01:32:35.091,"I had this whole plan that was meant to show you that I could be more than just an assistant, and then it totally fell apart."
01:32:36.133,01:32:42.848,"So… Mostly, though, I just really wanted to say thank you."
01:32:43.557,01:32:57.530,"'Cause I've always been in total awe of you, Grace, and to be able to witness the person that I admire the most do the thing that she does best… was the greatest time of my whole life."
01:32:57.780,01:33:01.242,Um… And I'm so grateful.
01:33:25.141,01:33:26.100,Hello?
01:33:26.183,01:33:28.060,Are you still mad at me?
01:33:28.144,01:33:30.688,Yeah. But I gotta talk to you about something.
01:33:30.771,01:33:36.819,"Well, I just wanna tell you that I'm really sorry about everything, and I really just wish we were writing."
01:33:38.571,01:33:39.905,Where are you?
01:33:39.989,01:34:00.593,"Well, actually, about that… What are you doing here?"
01:34:00.801,01:34:02.553,Your roommate told me where you were.
01:34:03.220,01:34:05.431,She was very rude. Yeah.
01:34:06.182,01:34:09.143,"So, do you know where you sent my suit to be tailored?"
01:34:09.226,01:34:10.770,I want to wear it tomorrow.
01:34:10.895,01:34:13.147,"Um, what suit?"
01:34:13.230,01:34:15.066,The one I wore to Michelle's birthday.
01:34:16.275,01:34:18.235,Obama or Williams?
01:34:19.779,01:34:22.198,I may or… Mm.
01:34:24.658,01:34:30.790,…may not have said some things that could have hurt someone's feelings.
01:34:32.083,01:34:38.881,And… for that… I forgive myself.
01:34:39.590,01:34:40.549,Yeah.
01:34:41.133,01:34:42.259,Was that an apology?
01:34:42.593,01:34:44.220,Absolutely not.
01:34:44.303,01:34:46.222,"No. No, it wasn't."
01:34:47.473,01:34:54.105,"I was pissed because you messed up, and you didn't do your job, and what else was I supposed to do?"
01:34:55.356,01:35:02.113,"But while you were gone, I… missed you."
01:35:04.073,01:35:07.993,I took having someone on my side for granted.
01:35:09.161,01:35:10.454,"-I'm always on-- -No, no."
01:35:10.538,01:35:12.206,"No, no. I have, actually, more to say."
01:35:13.082,01:35:18.421,I realized it's because… I trusted you.
01:35:18.504,01:35:22.341,And I have never trusted an assistant like that before.
01:35:22.425,01:35:23.467,Do not tell Gail.
01:35:25.803,01:35:27.596,But you were very good at your job.
01:35:28.431,01:35:33.227,"And you worked harder than anyone else ever has, and you loved it."
01:35:35.479,01:35:36.772,And you love my music.
01:35:38.232,01:35:39.733,And I appreciate that.
01:35:42.903,01:35:46.031,"Well, thank you for coming all the way here to tell me that."
01:35:46.115,01:35:47.867,"Maggie, that's not why I came here."
01:35:48.909,01:35:55.374,I came here to tell you that the work you did on the live album was very good.
01:35:55.708,01:35:57.501,-Really? -Yes.
01:35:57.585,01:35:59.670,I would have filled in the audience track a bit more.
01:35:59.753,01:36:02.423,-And I think you overmixed in some places. -Okay.
01:36:02.506,01:36:11.056,But you made me sound… Me.
01:36:12.725,01:36:14.602,I haven't heard her in a long time.
01:36:17.104,01:36:19.023,That's the sign of a good producer.
01:36:21.275,01:36:22.193,Thanks.
01:36:23.194,01:36:25.738,"So, it's gonna be tough, you know?"
01:36:26.655,01:36:31.243,Because it's really bleak out there for middle-aged singers.
01:36:31.577,01:36:33.913,"And when I get there, I'll confirm that."
01:36:35.164,01:36:37.625,But for female producers… Oh.
01:36:38.959,01:36:41.045,I've never worked with a female producer.
01:36:42.630,01:36:43.547,Yeah.
01:36:43.714,01:36:44.882,Should we give it a go?
01:36:50.429,01:36:51.388,Yes.
01:36:51.472,01:36:53.057,-Yeah? -Yes.
01:36:53.140,01:36:55.559,I am available for that. Mm-hmm.
01:36:57.353,01:36:58.354,Okay.
01:36:59.980,01:37:01.023,I've been writing.
01:37:01.482,01:37:02.566,I knew it.
01:37:04.818,01:37:06.946,-Do you want to hear 'em? -Yes.
01:37:07.029,01:37:08.364,"-Now? -So much, yeah."
01:38:10.342,01:38:11.552,-One second. -Okay.
01:38:12.136,01:38:13.429,Really?
01:38:13.512,01:38:16.473,"Okay. Well, that was… Just bared my soul."
01:38:16.724,01:38:17.850,Hi.
01:38:17.933,01:38:22.730,"Before we talk, I don't know how you did it, but Dan Deakins loves the songs."
01:38:22.813,01:38:24.356,-Oh. Yeah. -David?
01:38:24.440,01:38:27.818,"Um, this is… -Mom? -What are you doing here?"
01:38:27.901,01:38:28.777,Mom?
01:38:29.028,01:38:30.321,Did you send Dan the songs?
01:38:30.404,01:38:32.573,"Oh, sweetheart, are you recording?"
01:38:32.656,01:38:35.075,Sorry. Did you just call her Mom?
01:38:35.159,01:38:36.452,Are you his mom?
01:38:36.660,01:38:37.995,"Not now, Margaret."
01:38:38.203,01:38:40.289,"Yeah, I've been working on some stuff with Maggie."
01:38:40.372,01:38:42.833,"Dan showed his label the tracks, and they wanna sign me."
01:38:43.876,01:38:50.049,"So, wait. You… You were working with him while you were working for me?"
01:38:50.633,01:38:54.386,Is this the guy… Are you… Is this… Is this the boy?
01:38:58.140,01:38:58.974,Are you two dating?
01:38:59.058,01:38:59.975,-No. -Yeah.
01:39:00.059,01:39:03.228,"Hey, Magpie, I got some tacos."
01:39:04.396,01:39:08.651,Wow. It's… It's Grace Davis.
01:39:09.193,01:39:10.361,That's me.
01:39:14.156,01:39:15.616,You came on the ferry?
01:39:17.868,01:39:19.953,-I do. -Yeah.
01:39:20.037,01:39:21.872,-I have a helicopter. -Tell everybody.
01:39:22.665,01:39:30.839,"So, when you said that you and your mom just started talking again, you didn't think to tell me that your mom is Grace Davis?"
01:39:30.923,01:39:32.800,You didn't tell me you were working for her.
01:39:32.883,01:39:34.051,Don't change the subject.
01:39:40.724,01:39:41.684,We've met before.
01:39:43.644,01:39:48.023,1989. I interviewed you for my radio show on K-SADJ.
01:39:48.107,01:39:49.942,It was in LA.
01:39:50.025,01:39:51.735,Yes! Downtown.
01:39:52.027,01:39:54.029,I can't believe you remember that.
01:39:56.281,01:39:57.324,"Oh, my God. Wait."
01:39:57.408,01:40:00.202,You had long hair. You didn't have the beard.
01:40:00.994,01:40:05.999,And that voice… That was a really good show.
01:40:06.083,01:40:07.292,"I think it was, yeah."
01:40:07.376,01:40:08.752,And you had a pregnant wife.
01:40:09.503,01:40:10.462,"-Yeah, yeah. -Yeah."
01:40:10.546,01:40:13.006,She used to help me. And that was Maggie.
01:40:13.590,01:40:15.843,-What? What-- -The one inside the pregnant wife.
01:40:16.927,01:40:18.387,Small world.
01:40:19.638,01:40:22.224,Fucking long con.
01:40:28.105,01:40:30.065,I had him when I was so young.
01:40:30.816,01:40:36.113,"And I had a chance to change things for us, and I took it."
01:40:38.699,01:40:40.075,I took it.
01:40:43.162,01:40:44.621,Who else knows?
01:40:50.919,01:40:51.837,Gail.
01:40:55.007,01:40:56.049,Jack.
01:40:58.510,01:41:00.220,He was there when I had him.
01:41:01.054,01:41:02.765,Jack's always there.
01:41:02.848,01:41:16.612,I just don't… How did this… I know everything about you. I mean… I have really good lawyers. Like… Damn.
01:41:16.862,01:41:18.238,Are you gonna tell people?
01:41:18.864,01:41:21.617,"I wanted to, many times."
01:41:23.660,01:41:25.412,But he said he wasn't ready.
01:41:26.205,01:41:29.792,"And after everything I put him through, I respect that."
01:41:30.417,01:41:32.127,I wanted to help him with his music.
01:41:33.378,01:41:38.926,"But he was worried that people wouldn't take him seriously if I was involved, which I understand."
01:41:39.426,01:41:42.888,"It must have been really, really hard for you."
01:41:42.971,01:41:48.477,-Yeah. -For you both. I mean… Mostly him.
01:41:51.355,01:41:54.233,There's a lot of things I wish I had done differently.
01:41:55.526,01:41:56.860,But we're here now.
01:42:05.035,01:42:06.912,"He's really good, Grace."
01:42:14.169,01:42:15.838,Thank you. Thank you so much.
01:42:25.180,01:42:27.683,"-Oh, my God. That was amazing. -Oh, my God. This is so crazy."
01:42:27.766,01:42:29.476,You have to do it again. Go. Encore.
01:42:29.560,01:42:31.311,Encore. Do it. Yeah.
01:42:34.773,01:42:38.652,"So, before we go, we've got a surprise for y'all."
01:42:39.069,01:42:42.114,"-Someone very special is here tonight. -Oh, my God."
01:42:42.197,01:42:43.448,-Is he talking about you? -No.
01:42:43.699,01:42:47.035,And she happens to be a really great singer.
01:42:49.371,01:42:50.372,Come on out.
01:42:50.455,01:42:52.416,-Okay. Hold my phone. -Yup. Got it. Yup.
01:42:52.499,01:42:53.709,"-Excuse me, Margaret. -Whoa."
01:42:54.501,01:42:55.460,Grace?
01:42:55.878,01:42:57.004,"Oh, my God."
01:42:58.422,01:43:00.048,"Okay, that makes a lot more sense."
01:43:00.257,01:43:02.968,"My mom, Grace Davis."
01:43:15.188,01:43:16.273,"-Excuse me, ladies. -Jeez."
01:43:16.356,01:43:17.858,Can y'all back up a little bit?
01:43:17.941,01:43:19.192,Sorry.
01:44:35.060,01:44:37.771,She been waiting to do this for a long time.
01:46:21.416,01:46:23.585,"Damn, the girl still give me goose bumps."
01:46:25.837,01:46:27.756,"Grace, that was so good."
01:46:27.839,01:46:29.049,"Thank you, Maggie."
01:46:30.634,01:46:31.885,Let's take it from the top.
01:53:09.282,01:53:10.867,Trick question. This is dope.
