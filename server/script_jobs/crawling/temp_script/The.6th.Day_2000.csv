00:02:12.549,00:02:15.052,Their play-off hopes could hinge on this play.
00:02:15.094,00:02:17.554,A lot of pressure on young Johnny Phoenix.
00:02:17.596,00:02:21.475,As if being the first quarterback to earn 300 million isn't pressure enough.
00:02:28.398,00:02:30.525,"Red, thirty-two!"
00:02:32.945,00:02:33.904,Strong left!

00:03:19.282,00:03:21.535,"Get up, Johnny!"
00:03:25.039,00:03:27.415,The owner wants Johnny to have the absolute best of care.
00:03:27.457,00:03:30.169,He's gonna need it.
00:03:30.209,00:03:32.211,It may not be as bad as you think it is.
00:03:41.680,00:03:45.726,The status?
00:03:45.767,00:03:47.644,Maybe we can trade him to L.A.
00:03:49.396,00:03:53.358,I want you to terminate his contract and bring him back to the lab right away.
00:03:53.400,00:03:56.653,-Understand?
00:03:56.695,00:04:00.323,"Sorry, Johnny. You're gonna have to take one for the team."
00:04:21.220,00:04:23.055,Do I look any different to you?
00:04:24.681,00:04:28.351,"Oh, gee."
00:04:28.393,00:04:29.895,Never had a mustache.
00:04:30.604,00:04:34.108,Oh. Then no.
00:04:34.149,00:04:36.443,Johnny Phoenix will play next week.
00:04:36.484,00:04:38.403,Early diagnosis had him sidelined.
00:04:38.445,00:04:41.531,"After further investigation, his injuries proved to be minor."
00:04:41.573,00:04:42.866,"Good morning, Adam."
00:04:42.908,00:04:45.535,"At 11:00, you have a VIP client, Michael Drucker."
00:04:45.577,00:04:47.412,"And by the way, happy birthday."
00:04:47.454,00:04:50.290,I don't feel any different. Hmm.
00:04:50.331,00:04:53.001,-Is Clara up yet?
00:04:56.838,00:04:59.424,You gonna spend all day looking for new wrinkles?
00:04:59.466,00:05:02.302,Or are you gonna get in here and give me a kiss? Hmm?
00:05:02.343,00:05:04.221,"Well, I suppose if I have to."
00:05:04.263,00:05:06.181,"Oh, bully!"
00:05:06.223,00:05:13.188,"-You're not gettin' You know, you don't look any different."
00:05:13.230,00:05:16.066,No. You look much better than when we met.
00:05:16.108,00:05:17.484,I love you.
00:05:23.115,00:05:26.118,"Lock the door. Oh, God!"
00:05:27.452,00:05:30.956,"-Daddy, Daddy, Happy birthday!"
00:05:30.998,00:05:32.499,-What?
00:05:32.540,00:05:34.584,Clara...
00:05:34.626,00:05:36.170,"Careful, you're getting a little old for that."
00:05:36.211,00:05:37.504,I am not!
00:05:37.545,00:05:39.298,"No, I meant your father."
00:05:39.338,00:05:42.050,-Very funny.
00:05:42.092,00:05:43.218,"-Oh, great!"
00:05:43.260,00:05:44.261,"Come on, Dad!"
00:05:44.303,00:05:46.972,I can't find you.
00:05:47.014,00:05:48.849,"I'm right behind you, Dad."
00:05:48.890,00:05:51.559,"-I'm here, right here!"
00:05:51.601,00:05:56.231,"their shorter life span, these family members can't help but break our hearts."
00:05:56.273,00:06:00.194,"Should accident, illness or age end your pet's natural life..."
00:06:00.235,00:06:02.403,"Oliver, have you seen Clara somewhere?"
00:06:02.445,00:06:08.493,"You can have him back the same day in perfect health with zero defects guaranteed, thanks to RePet."
00:06:11.830,00:06:14.415,Nacho-flavored or regular?
00:06:14.457,00:06:16.960,I'll take banana-flavored.
00:06:18.461,00:06:20.588,I love this card. Beautiful.
00:06:20.630,00:06:23.967,"Dad, can I have a Sim-Pal for your birthday?"
00:06:24.009,00:06:26.011,You want a gift on my birthday?
00:06:26.053,00:06:29.388,That way you won't feel guilty that you're the only one getting something.
00:06:29.430,00:06:30.765,"Well, what's a Sim-Pal?"
00:06:30.807,00:06:31.975,A life-size doll.
00:06:32.017,00:06:38.481,A make-believe friend that grows real hair and can do a lot of stuff.
00:06:38.523,00:06:41.985,Can't your real friends grow real hair and do lots of stuff?
00:06:42.027,00:06:44.696,"Yeah, but they all have Sim-Pals."
00:06:44.738,00:06:46.031,Ask your mommy.
00:06:46.073,00:06:47.824,"You're the greatest, Dad!"
00:06:49.993,00:06:52.787,Mommy! Mommy!
00:07:02.463,00:07:04.507,You are getting low on milk.
00:07:04.549,00:07:06.509,-Thank you for ordering milk.
00:07:06.551,00:07:10.389,You're getting so fast.
00:07:10.430,00:07:15.227,Into the car. Very nice.
00:07:19.731,00:07:21.482,-Hey.
00:07:21.524,00:07:24.652,"-Oh, I had a breakfast of champions today."
00:07:24.694,00:07:27.781,Destination Double X Charter Airport selected.
00:07:27.822,00:07:30.575,wouldn't stop talking.
00:07:27.822,00:07:32.869,"My virtual girlfriend, she talks, but at least I can turn her off."
00:07:32.911,00:07:34.454,and your virtual girls.
00:07:34.495,00:07:39.209,"I mean, here you are, a grown man, and your primary relationship is with a piece of software."
00:07:39.251,00:07:42.963,"Yeah, well, if all your senses tell you you have a hot chick on your lap, then you have a hot chick on your lap."
00:07:43.004,00:07:44.505,"I don't have to look any further, okay?"
00:07:46.133,00:07:47.634,"You know, they invented something called the Laser Razor."
00:07:47.675,00:07:49.094,"No nicks, cuts or scratches."
00:07:49.136,00:07:50.678,You should think about using it.
00:07:50.720,00:07:52.722,I like the old-fashioned kind.
00:07:52.764,00:07:54.557,They remind me I'm still alive.
00:07:54.599,00:07:56.393,"Hey, you want to hang out at Kelly's after work?"
00:07:57.894,00:08:00.521,I know that Natalie is throwing me a surprise party.
00:08:01.522,00:08:02.482,Why do you say that?
00:08:02.523,00:08:04.401,Because I told her you told me.
00:08:04.443,00:08:07.028,"-No, you didn't."
00:08:07.070,00:08:08.196,Why did you do that?
00:08:08.238,00:08:09.530,I didn't.
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.283,"I just wanted to know, and now I know."
00:08:11.325,00:08:13.243,I can't believe I was that easy.
00:08:13.285,00:08:16.496,"Your destination, Double X Charter Airport, is ahead."
00:08:16.537,00:08:20.334,OnStar will now disengage automatic drive. Are you ready?
00:08:20.375,00:08:21.876,Yes.
00:08:21.918,00:08:23.711,Manual drive engaged.
00:08:27.632,00:08:29.717,I want you to do me a favor at the party tonight.
00:08:29.759,00:08:32.387,Don't get drunk and set the drapes on fire?
00:08:32.429,00:08:33.513,You already told me that.
00:08:35.723,00:08:42.147,"But what I was going to say was around 11:00, 11:30, I want you to start singing really loud, Happy Birthday."
00:08:42.189,00:08:44.191,-For what?
00:08:42.189,00:08:46.109,"-And the way you sing, it's gonna clear out the place like a bomb scare."
00:08:46.151,00:08:50.238,"Oh, I get it."
00:08:50.280,00:08:52.699,"-Good morning, Rosie."
00:08:52.740,00:08:55.994,"Oh, Henry checked out the upgrade on the remote."
00:08:56.036,00:08:59.956,"Oh, they came in!"
00:08:59.998,00:09:02.334,"Oh, and Drucker's office just called. Guess what?"
00:09:03.001,00:09:04.419,They canceled.
00:09:04.461,00:09:07.088,No. We're all gonna be tested for drugs and alcohol.
00:09:07.130,00:09:09.799,"So? Oh, this is cool!"
00:09:09.841,00:09:11.092,We're gonna be tested?
00:09:12.010,00:09:14.721,Not you guys. Just us pilots.
00:09:14.762,00:09:17.349,"Hey, Hank, look at this."
00:09:17.391,00:09:19.267,-Out goes the old one.
00:09:19.309,00:09:22.103,"Hey, Adam, this is Tripp."
00:09:22.145,00:09:23.063,It's his first time with us.
00:09:23.104,00:09:24.605,-Hey. Welcome.
00:09:24.647,00:09:26.400,"Adam, Natalie's on line one."
00:09:31.696,00:09:32.906,"What's up, honey?"
00:09:33.781,00:09:34.741,You look upset.
00:09:35.742,00:09:37.118,"Oh, Adam!"
00:09:37.160,00:09:40.080,"I just talked to the vet, and they've, um..."
00:09:40.121,00:09:42.207,They had to put Oliver to sleep.
00:09:42.249,00:09:43.750,What? He wasn't even that sick.
00:09:43.791,00:09:51.425,"I know, I know, but apparently he had some kind of, I don't know, highly infectious canine virus or something and they had to put him down."
00:09:51.466,00:09:53.927,Oliver was licking Clara's face this morning.
00:09:53.968,00:10:00.267,"Don't worry because I asked the same thing, and the virus is harmless to humans, so, um, so she's fine."
00:10:00.308,00:10:02.352,But this is going to break her heart and you know that.
00:10:03.895,00:10:06.273,"No, it won't."
00:10:06.314,00:10:10.944,I want you to go down to RePet and get Oliver replaced.
00:10:10.985,00:10:14.906,I'm not going to have some freak of science sleeping in my daughter's bed.
00:10:14.948,00:10:18.618,-It's not dangerous.
00:10:18.659,00:10:19.744,She's only eight.
00:10:19.786,00:10:21.288,"She won't understand that, honey."
00:10:21.329,00:10:24.124,"Look, it's the natural process of life."
00:10:24.165,00:10:25.833,"You're born, you live and you die."
00:10:25.875,00:10:27.461,She has to learn about it someday.
00:10:27.502,00:10:29.921,But she doesn't have to learn about it on your birthday.
00:10:29.963,00:10:31.714,"I really appreciate that, honey."
00:10:31.756,00:10:32.632,Will you do it?
00:10:32.924,00:10:34.717,No.
00:10:34.759,00:10:35.927,"-Thank you, darling."
00:10:35.969,00:10:37.845,"No, no. Listen."
00:10:35.969,00:10:40.932,"Natalie, I just won't-- Double X Charter, your passport to outdoor adventure."
00:10:40.974,00:10:43.393,No use fighting. We always win.
00:10:43.435,00:10:46.729,Flying you to breathtaking vistas at world premiere locations.
00:10:46.771,00:10:50.233,"For incredible skiing and snowboarding, Double X Charter."
00:10:53.111,00:10:55.363,you can go in this one.
00:11:07.000,00:11:10.003,This is gonna be so great.
00:11:12.839,00:11:15.716,"Nine-seven-four-seven, you're cleared for takeoff."
00:11:15.758,00:11:17.135,Bring it on. All right!
00:11:41.493,00:11:43.744,"All right, good. Any questions?"
00:11:43.786,00:11:47.582,"Yeah, I got a question."
00:11:47.624,00:11:49.668,"-Yeah, I got a dog."
00:11:49.708,00:11:52.045,-I got your point.
00:11:52.086,00:11:53.963,-I got your point.
00:12:01.888,00:12:03.598,You scared the crap out of me.
00:12:03.640,00:12:04.641,Very.
00:12:13.941,00:12:17.612,"I know you're old school, but all the kids today, they grew up with RePets."
00:12:17.654,00:12:19.447,These days it's totally normal.
00:12:19.989,00:12:21.740,Not to me.
00:12:21.782,00:12:24.327,Not to you. You want your kid crying all night because her dog died?
00:12:24.369,00:12:26.329,Don't do anything about it.
00:12:26.371,00:12:28.540,Don't you think it's even a little bit creepy?
00:12:28.582,00:12:29.416,No.
00:12:30.791,00:12:32.252,I don't.
00:12:32.293,00:12:34.504,Let's test the remote.
00:12:34.546,00:12:36.047,"All righty, here we go."
00:12:44.431,00:12:47.642,"I'm telling you, these RePets, they come back to you, you cannot tell the difference."
00:12:47.684,00:12:48.935,"Trust me, I had it done."
00:12:48.976,00:12:49.810,Bullshit.
00:12:52.939,00:12:55.316,"Sadie, my cat."
00:12:55.358,00:12:56.276,She's a RePet.
00:12:56.317,00:12:58.027,You had your cat cloned?
00:12:58.069,00:13:00.697,"-Yeah, well, she fell out of my condo window."
00:13:09.456,00:13:10.290,Shit!
00:13:15.002,00:13:15.962,Whoo!
00:13:30.644,00:13:31.686,Whoa!
00:13:38.652,00:13:40.236,"-Hey, you did well."
00:13:40.278,00:13:42.280,How long are you supposed to keep me at Kelly's?
00:13:42.322,00:13:43.657,Till seven. Why?
00:13:43.698,00:13:45.492,Maybe we should check out RePet.
00:14:02.925,00:14:05.886,Good morning.
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.722,"Yep, that's us."
00:14:07.764,00:14:11.142,Excellent. Larry Stern.
00:14:11.184,00:14:15.021,I've got a contract here.
00:14:11.184,00:14:19.859,I think you'll find it pretty standard except for-- Who was flying that one?
00:14:19.900,00:14:21.778,"Me, with the remote control."
00:14:21.820,00:14:24.489,We can fly four of these between the two of us now.
00:14:24.531,00:14:25.490,Amazing.
00:14:25.532,00:14:26.949,Are you here for the blood test?
00:14:26.991,00:14:29.828,"Uh, no. My technician is set up in your office."
00:14:29.869,00:14:32.372,You said these forms are standard except what?
00:14:32.413,00:14:35.458,It's our normal charter contract.
00:14:35.500,00:14:38.211,"During the flight, you may overhear Mr. Drucker's phone calls."
00:14:38.252,00:14:42.423,It could be anything from big mergers to inside information on his sports teams.
00:14:42.465,00:14:45.385,"Regardless, we have a legal obligation to protect that stuff."
00:14:45.426,00:14:47.512,What does this guy think?
00:14:47.554,00:14:51.015,"Oh, no, he considers her to be the world's second most important person."
00:14:53.643,00:14:55.562,"Ooh, that's big stuff."
00:14:55.603,00:14:57.063,All for a day of snowboarding?
00:14:59.273,00:15:02.360,The blood test was agony.
00:15:02.402,00:15:05.154,"Oh, she's just kidding."
00:15:05.196,00:15:07.407,It really doesn't hurt.
00:15:08.742,00:15:10.451,"-Yes, just like that."
00:15:11.703,00:15:13.496,-All done.
00:15:13.538,00:15:14.706,Now I need to check your vision.
00:15:14.748,00:15:16.249,Place your chin here.
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.250,Right here?
00:15:17.917,00:15:18.877,Mm-hmm.
00:15:18.918,00:15:20.879,Do you blood test all your pilots?
00:15:20.920,00:15:23.464,"Pilots, drivers, security people, assistants."
00:15:23.506,00:15:26.300,Basically anyone who comes in contact with Mr. Drucker.
00:15:26.342,00:15:27.343,Hmm.
00:15:31.556,00:15:32.599,-Yep.
00:15:33.600,00:15:34.559,And here.
00:15:40.189,00:15:42.483,"Perfect, both of you."
00:15:42.525,00:15:45.612,After this I'm going to town to test a chef and two waiters.
00:15:48.030,00:15:51.075,The pink copy of the Charter contract is yours.
00:15:51.117,00:15:52.452,I'll take the rest.
00:15:52.493,00:15:54.621,-Here we go.
00:15:54.662,00:15:55.747,-Thank you.
00:15:59.125,00:16:00.835,"You know, I could take care of Drucker."
00:16:00.877,00:16:02.754,"That way, you could have plenty of time to get Oliver cloned."
00:16:02.796,00:16:04.839,I'm not getting the dog cloned.
00:16:04.881,00:16:06.132,I'm just gonna check it out.
00:16:06.173,00:16:08.885,"I know you're gonna check it out, but once you see it, you're gonna say yes."
00:16:08.927,00:16:10.845,"I know deep down inside, you're a softy."
00:16:10.887,00:16:15.934,"Um, they specifically asked for Adam, -by name."
00:16:15.975,00:16:18.060,I also know that the bodyguards can't tell the difference.
00:16:18.102,00:16:19.353,They never got our names.
00:16:20.104,00:16:21.815,-Oh!
00:16:21.856,00:16:24.317,"Look, Adam, I know that I screw around a lot."
00:16:24.358,00:16:26.611,"But when it comes to flying, you know I'm serious."
00:16:26.653,00:16:27.987,I could do it.
00:16:28.028,00:16:29.530,Go enjoy your birthday.
00:16:30.615,00:16:34.452,"If you want to be me, try to act a little bit more manly."
00:16:34.494,00:16:36.287,-Yeah. Chest.
00:16:36.329,00:16:38.205,-Stomach in.
00:16:44.086,00:16:46.213,the Speaker of the House.
00:16:46.255,00:16:47.465,I want the Speaker there.
00:16:47.507,00:16:51.218,"No, you don't mention my name at all. Huh?"
00:16:51.260,00:16:52.512,"Hang on a second, Dave."
00:16:52.553,00:16:54.263,"Hi, I'm Michael Drucker."
00:16:54.305,00:16:56.432,That's right.
00:16:56.474,00:17:00.060,"Well, Pete Hume speaks very highly of you, says you know the mountains like nobody else."
00:17:00.102,00:17:02.438,"Thank you. That's probably true for everyone except for my partner, but thank you."
00:17:02.480,00:17:03.898,I'm looking forward to it.
00:17:03.940,00:17:05.566,"-So, we all set?"
00:17:05.608,00:17:08.987,We've stationed our people monitoring the rescue beacons-- -Don't need the details.
00:17:09.028,00:17:12.156,"-Your favorite snowboard's behind your seat, sir."
00:17:12.198,00:17:19.539,"Dave, look, we gave a lot of money to his campaign, not to mention what I pay your law firm, so I'm counting on you, all right."
00:17:19.580,00:17:20.581,Are you gonna get me the Speaker?
00:17:21.415,00:17:22.750,Good.
00:17:22.792,00:17:25.336,"So, Sally, who's next?"
00:17:55.867,00:17:57.869,"the Roadrunners, right?"
00:18:13.927,00:18:16.429,wake up. Wake up!
00:18:17.430,00:18:19.223,We're here. Woodland Mall.
00:18:26.647,00:18:27.899,Oh.
00:18:30.026,00:18:31.151,I was asleep.
00:18:35.073,00:18:36.657,Welcome to Woodland Mall.
00:18:36.699,00:18:40.119,Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you.
00:18:40.160,00:18:43.623,"Food court, ground level."
00:18:45.041,00:18:47.293,Stop the cloning.
00:18:47.334,00:18:49.503,Stop the cloning.
00:18:49.545,00:18:51.297,Stop the cloning.
00:18:51.338,00:18:53.549,"Save your soul, man."
00:18:53.591,00:18:54.842,"Don't go in there, man."
00:18:54.884,00:18:56.427,"Well, then God shouldn't have killed my dog."
00:18:56.469,00:18:57.804,Atheist.
00:18:57.845,00:18:59.722,Stop the cloning.
00:18:59.764,00:19:02.809,We can clone your four-legged loved one in just a few short hours.
00:19:02.850,00:19:04.518,How can we do it?
00:19:04.560,00:19:12.401,"It all begins with the growing of blanks, animal drones stripped of all characteristic DNA, in embryonic tanks at the RePet factory."
00:19:12.443,00:19:20.910,"In stage two, your pet's DNA is extracted from a lock of fur or a drop of blood and then infused on a cellular level into the blank."
00:19:20.952,00:19:29.836,"In the final stage, using RePet's patented cerebral syncording process, all of your pet's thoughts, memories and instincts are painlessly transplanted via the optic nerve."
00:19:31.295,00:19:32.880,"Still can't make up your mind, huh?"
00:19:35.133,00:19:36.509,"You lost a dog, right?"
00:19:37.593,00:19:39.261,Yes. My daughter's.
00:19:39.303,00:19:41.097,"Oh, what a heartbreak."
00:19:41.139,00:19:42.640,What'd you say his name was again?
00:19:43.390,00:19:44.266,Oliver.
00:19:44.308,00:19:49.981,"Well, Oliver's in luck, because we're having a special this week, twenty percent off."
00:19:50.023,00:19:51.524,When did Oliver die?
00:19:51.565,00:19:53.192,Sometime this morning.
00:19:53.233,00:19:55.444,"Oh, that's perfect."
00:19:55.486,00:19:58.739,But you've got to act fast.
00:19:58.781,00:20:01.367,I have a problem with that whole idea.
00:20:01.408,00:20:04.704,"I mean, suppose that clones have no soul, or they're dangerous."
00:20:04.745,00:20:07.373,Clone pets are every bit as safe as real pets.
00:20:07.414,00:20:09.834,Plus... They're insured.
00:20:09.876,00:20:14.505,"Well, if it is so safe, then why is it against the law to clone human beings?"
00:20:14.547,00:20:17.508,Because the human brain is much too complicated to syncord.
00:20:17.550,00:20:19.760,"Now, you remember that experiment they did, right?"
00:20:19.802,00:20:23.597,-Yes.
00:20:23.639,00:20:26.851,"But with pets, it's a totally proven technology."
00:20:26.893,00:20:30.396,"Your RePet, Oliver, will be exactly the same dog."
00:20:30.437,00:20:34.942,"He'll know all the same tricks you taught him, he'll remember where all the bones are buried."
00:20:34.984,00:20:36.443,He won't even know he's a clone.
00:20:37.236,00:20:39.238,"And, did I mention?"
00:20:39.279,00:20:40.406,They're insured.
00:20:40.447,00:20:42.158,"Look, I don't care about the insurance."
00:20:42.200,00:20:46.079,I care about if I can trust my daughter with a large animal with sharp teeth.
00:20:46.120,00:20:49.707,"We can make him smaller if you want, with softer teeth."
00:20:49.749,00:20:52.126,-You can?
00:20:49.749,00:20:54.461,-We can even color-coordinate him to match your decorating scheme.
00:20:54.503,00:20:57.006,"Sim-Pal, the best friend money can buy."
00:20:57.048,00:20:58.340,Let me think about that.
00:20:58.382,00:21:00.093,Who's fun to be with.
00:21:00.134,00:21:02.302,Treat your kids to a Sim-Pal today.
00:21:02.344,00:21:03.221,I might be back.
00:21:04.097,00:21:05.681,You'll be back.
00:21:05.723,00:21:07.850,Your daughter will think you're the best dad in the world.
00:21:07.892,00:21:11.562,My kid sister has two of these -and she loves them.
00:21:11.604,00:21:13.355,"Come, let's fix the collar."
00:21:13.397,00:21:14.607,There you are.
00:21:14.648,00:21:17.068,-It's amazing how real this is.
00:21:17.110,00:21:18.652,My daughter will be so excited.
00:21:18.694,00:21:20.238,"Come, let's go home."
00:21:27.411,00:21:29.205,You have called Hank Morgan.
00:21:29.247,00:21:31.665,"Hi, I'm not here to take your call so please leave a message."
00:21:31.707,00:21:33.333,"Hank, it's me again."
00:21:33.375,00:21:34.585,What the hell happened to you?
00:21:34.627,00:21:36.336,I waited at Kelly's for over half an hour.
00:21:36.378,00:21:39.465,-It's now five past seven.
00:21:39.506,00:21:41.217,What's... Your name?
00:21:41.259,00:21:42.218,Um...
00:21:42.260,00:21:44.303,"Look, I'm heading home now."
00:21:44.344,00:21:47.389,-If you get this message-- -Let's be friends.
00:21:47.431,00:21:51.227,-What's your name?
00:21:51.269,00:21:54.105,Head over to my house with a bunch of flowers and a good excuse.
00:21:54.147,00:21:55.898,Otherwise Natalie's gonna kill you.
00:21:55.940,00:21:58.151,-I can sing songs.
00:21:58.192,00:22:00.360,Would you like to sing with me?
00:22:00.402,00:22:02.780,Excuse me.
00:22:02.822,00:22:06.159,-I can play games.
00:22:06.200,00:22:08.035,-I can sing songs.
00:22:08.077,00:22:09.787,Would you like to sing with me...
00:22:09.829,00:22:10.997,Go to sleep.
00:22:20.214,00:22:22.133,Thank you. Thanks for the ride.
00:22:22.800,00:22:23.801,Good night.
00:22:33.978,00:22:36.314,"Clara, sweetie, honey."
00:22:36.354,00:22:39.984,"Oliver was very sick, and he had to be put down."
00:22:42.987,00:22:46.949,"Clara, sweetie, honey."
00:22:48.366,00:22:50.119,"Why, Daddy?"
00:22:50.161,00:22:58.418,"You see, it's because-- It's because-- Shit! Oliver, why did you have to die?"
00:23:02.131,00:23:03.299,Oliver?
00:23:10.514,00:23:11.557,Natalie.
00:23:34.205,00:23:35.581,Can you help me?
00:23:35.622,00:23:38.167,"One, two, three!"
00:23:44.422,00:23:46.508,-Look at this cake here!
00:24:13.411,00:24:14.536,Adam Gibson?
00:24:15.329,00:24:16.956,Who are you?
00:24:16.997,00:24:19.583,We have a little situation.
00:24:20.626,00:24:22.086,What the hell is going on here?
00:24:22.128,00:24:24.255,Just cooperate and everything will be fine.
00:24:24.297,00:24:29.760,"Fine? There's someone in my house, eating my birthday cake, with my family, and it's not me."
00:24:29.802,00:24:30.844,We know.
00:24:30.886,00:24:32.721,There's been a Sixth Day violation.
00:24:32.763,00:24:34.307,A human was cloned.
00:24:34.348,00:24:35.849,That human was you.
00:24:35.891,00:24:37.601,We can help you.
00:24:37.643,00:24:40.938,-Then get him out of there!
00:24:40.980,00:24:45.651,"Now, look, I don't know who the hell you people are."
00:24:45.692,00:24:48.195,-But I'm going inside my house.
00:24:58.914,00:25:01.959,-Oops. Cindy fell down.
00:25:07.589,00:25:08.632,Not here!
00:25:21.895,00:25:24.482,I'm Sim-Pal Cindy.
00:25:48.214,00:25:50.590,"no, hold your fire!"
00:25:50.632,00:25:53.969,"That way! Go! Vincent, go!"
00:25:54.011,00:25:55.971,I have a boo-boo.
00:26:13.489,00:26:15.157,Stop the car!
00:26:15.199,00:26:16.574,-Huh?
00:26:19.703,00:26:21.579,Thanks for the suggestion!
00:26:23.207,00:26:25.000,Don't even blink.
00:26:25.042,00:26:27.044,"Oh, my God."
00:26:27.086,00:26:29.296,-They stole my Cadillac.
00:26:39.306,00:26:40.974,Car chase. Cool!
00:26:46.021,00:26:48.941,-Who are you?
00:26:52.361,00:26:55.114,I'm Sim-Pal Cindy.
00:26:55.155,00:26:56.782,Please secure child seat restraint.
00:27:15.759,00:27:18.678,-Where is this guy?
00:27:18.720,00:27:21.140,-Let's be friends.
00:27:21.181,00:27:22.391,What's your name?
00:27:23.641,00:27:25.144,Will you be my mommy?
00:27:25.185,00:27:26.604,I don't wanna be your mommy!
00:27:26.644,00:27:28.314,-Shut up!
00:27:32.485,00:27:34.820,Somebody do something about that damn doll!
00:27:39.699,00:27:42.702,I have a boo-boo.
00:27:50.877,00:27:52.254,Why does anyone want to kill me?
00:27:52.963,00:27:54.465,He got home first.
00:27:54.507,00:27:56.634,You saw him. He didn't see you.
00:27:56.674,00:27:58.760,You're screwed.
00:27:58.802,00:28:03.307,He's gonna live out the rest of your boring little life and never be the wiser.
00:28:03.349,00:28:06.352,"Your wife and kid see you and him together, they'll be killed."
00:28:21.950,00:28:23.785,-Whoa!
00:28:26.205,00:28:27.122,"Oh, shit!"
00:28:51.438,00:28:53.148,"God damn it, Wiley!"
00:28:54.692,00:28:55.901,Son of a bitch!
00:29:16.296,00:29:18.048,Blow out his tires this time!
00:29:25.347,00:29:26.557,Oh...
00:29:36.233,00:29:37.192,Yes!
00:30:30.287,00:30:31.705,"Oh, son of a bitch."
00:30:32.998,00:30:34.040,Hold my belt.
00:30:35.668,00:30:36.543,Okay.
00:30:40.380,00:30:41.715,-You got me?
00:30:44.217,00:30:45.344,Little more.
00:31:11.328,00:31:13.664,Let's get some people downriver and look for this guy.
00:31:13.706,00:31:16.583,"Go pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies, get 'em back to the lab."
00:31:35.101,00:31:37.604,"Weir Clinic, stay away!"
00:31:37.646,00:31:45.445,Welcome to the new home of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility-- Replacement Technologies.
00:31:45.487,00:31:50.909,"Dr. Weir, protesters claim that cloning human organs will inevitably lead to cloning whole humans."
00:31:50.950,00:31:54.788,"That's not only illegal, but we're years away from the technical ability to do it."
00:31:54.830,00:31:57.541,"But a human was cloned over ten years ago, Doctor."
00:31:57.583,00:31:59.835,And we all know the outcome of that bizarre experiment.
00:32:00.419,00:32:07.509,"If you recall, the Supreme Court ordered that the clone be destroyed, and I think that under the conditions, it was the humane thing to do."
00:32:07.551,00:32:12.972,It led to the laws against human cloning and set back the course of legitimate research by many years.
00:32:13.014,00:32:15.642,Mr. Drucker? Mr. Drucker?
00:32:13.014,00:32:17.603,You gave $100 million-- This is Dr. Weir's night.
00:32:17.644,00:32:21.314,"Dr. Weir, is it true that you're trying to get the Sixth Day Laws repealed?"
00:32:21.356,00:32:24.025,"Dr. Weir is interested in medicine, not politics."
00:32:24.067,00:32:30.699,"Mr. Drucker, the protesters outside claim that you run RePet at a loss in order to soften people up to the idea of human cloning."
00:32:30.741,00:32:34.494,"You know, we shouldn't forget that not so long ago..."
00:32:34.536,00:32:37.539,There were literally almost no more fish left in the ocean.
00:32:37.581,00:32:40.834,And half the world's population faced a very real threat of hunger.
00:32:40.876,00:32:43.378,Our cloning technology helped turn that around.
00:32:43.420,00:32:47.883,The extremists don't like to admit that they'd rather the world went hungry than eat cloned fish.
00:32:47.925,00:32:50.051,So instead they keep yelling about human cloning.
00:32:50.093,00:32:53.555,Do you think the human cloning laws should be changed?
00:32:53.597,00:32:57.810,Suppose a ten-year-old boy lies in a hospital bed dying of liver cancer.
00:32:57.851,00:33:01.855,"Thanks to Dr. Weir's work, we can save that boy."
00:33:01.897,00:33:07.402,"Now, in the next bed lies another ten-year-old boy whose parents love him just as much."
00:33:07.444,00:33:10.238,Only this child has an inoperable brain tumor.
00:33:10.280,00:33:12.783,"Now, you cannot clone a brain."
00:33:12.825,00:33:16.411,The only way to save him would be to clone the whole person.
00:33:16.453,00:33:28.256,"Now how do you tell that boy's parents that we can save the first boy, but the research that would have saved their son, it wasn't done because of a law that was passed by frightened politicians a decade ago."
00:33:28.298,00:33:30.091,So what does that mean?
00:33:30.133,00:33:31.176,Enjoy the party.
00:33:40.059,00:33:41.311,Looked like you needed rescuing.
00:33:41.353,00:33:43.062,"Yes, Michael, I did."
00:33:43.104,00:33:47.985,"Weir Clinic, stay away!"
00:33:48.026,00:33:53.072,"Weir Clinic, stay away!"
00:33:57.243,00:33:58.119,Johnny.
00:33:58.161,00:34:01.122,How's my star quarterback?
00:34:01.164,00:34:05.502,"I'd say I was feeling like a million bucks, except I'd hate to take a cut in pay."
00:34:05.544,00:34:07.504,"Don't remind me, all right?"
00:34:07.546,00:34:10.423,That was one nasty hit you took last week.
00:34:10.465,00:34:13.385,"Be careful, son."
00:34:13.426,00:34:14.594,Katherine?
00:34:15.428,00:34:16.722,You all right?
00:34:16.763,00:34:19.016,I'm just feeling like I don't quite belong.
00:34:19.057,00:34:21.935,"-No, no, no."
00:34:21.977,00:34:23.020,"No, you're not."
00:34:24.103,00:34:25.480,Should I call Dr. Stevens?
00:34:25.522,00:34:29.317,"No, no, no. No, no."
00:34:29.359,00:34:31.236,"I'll get a car to take you home, okay?"
00:34:31.277,00:34:32.404,Thank you.
00:34:36.115,00:34:38.702,thank you so much for coming.
00:34:40.078,00:34:41.496,That was quite a speech.
00:34:41.538,00:34:44.541,You heard that? I didn't mean to get carried away.
00:34:44.583,00:34:46.919,"Well, your words meant a great deal to me."
00:34:46.960,00:34:51.048,"You see, as it happens, I have a son with an inoperable tumor of the brain."
00:34:52.173,00:34:54.843,"Oh, my God! I'm so sorry, sir."
00:34:54.885,00:35:00.557,"It must've been in my subconscious, knowing you were here, but I never meant for you to-- No, no, it's quite all right."
00:35:00.599,00:35:02.475,Gave me a lot to think about.
00:35:02.517,00:35:05.020,"In fact, it gave me a different view of the whole subject."
00:35:06.396,00:35:11.276,"Mr. Speaker, could I offer you a glass of brandy in my office upstairs?"
00:35:21.536,00:35:24.205,I was 50 when Billy was born.
00:35:24.247,00:35:26.583,Didn't know if I wanted another kid so late.
00:35:27.793,00:35:29.878,But now I love him so damn much.
00:35:34.424,00:35:42.891,"If there was something that we could do for Billy, only it was highly illegal, would you consider it?"
00:35:42.933,00:35:44.309,Of course I would.
00:35:44.350,00:35:50.023,"That's the same kind of hypothetical situation-- No, no, no, don't answer so fast."
00:35:50.065,00:35:53.902,You'd be facing a mandatory minimum sentence of 40 years if it ever came out.
00:35:53.944,00:35:55.487,But would he be cured?
00:35:55.528,00:35:57.990,He'd be exactly the same as he was before.
00:35:58.031,00:36:02.661,Perfect health.
00:36:02.702,00:36:09.542,"But if the secret ever did come out with the law the way it is now, he'd be put to sleep like a rabid dog."
00:36:09.584,00:36:12.045,He'd be destroyed just like a racehorse with a broken leg.
00:36:12.087,00:36:14.380,And if it never came out?
00:36:15.465,00:36:17.634,Or if the laws were changed one day?
00:36:21.220,00:36:23.181,Then Billy wouldn't have anything to worry about.
00:36:53.712,00:36:58.383,"Please, I beg you, just go out to my house and pick up my wife and daughter."
00:36:58.424,00:37:02.054,"Because if I go back there, they will kill them both."
00:37:02.095,00:37:04.681,You made a completely different police report an hour ago.
00:37:04.723,00:37:06.016,"No, I didn't."
00:37:06.058,00:37:06.975,"According to this, you did."
00:37:07.017,00:37:08.476,And they checked your thumbprint.
00:37:08.518,00:37:10.062,But it must've been the clone.
00:37:12.939,00:37:15.525,"Look, I know it sounds crazy."
00:37:15.567,00:37:17.777,I can hardly believe it myself.
00:37:17.819,00:37:19.529,Was your car stolen or not?
00:37:19.571,00:37:21.031,-Yes.
00:37:21.073,00:37:22.991,No. It was me who took it.
00:37:23.033,00:37:24.409,You stole your own car?
00:37:24.450,00:37:26.912,Hello. I'm your court-appointed virtual attorney.
00:37:26.953,00:37:28.788,You don't have to answer that question.
00:37:28.830,00:37:31.208,Is my client being officially charged with auto theft?
00:37:31.249,00:37:33.292,-I didn't steal it. It's mine.
00:37:31.249,00:37:35.003,-He claims the report was filed by his clone.
00:37:35.045,00:37:38.631,I see. Loading the virtual psychiatrist.
00:37:38.673,00:37:43.469,"Oh, Mr. Gibson."
00:37:43.511,00:37:45.513,Do you want me to go through the whole thing now with him?
00:37:45.555,00:37:48.641,You seem to be avoiding talking about your parents.
00:37:48.683,00:37:52.478,"Imagine, two turtles are walking through the desert-- Oh, shut up!"
00:37:58.401,00:37:59.402,Hmm.
00:37:59.444,00:38:00.319,Hmm what?
00:38:01.738,00:38:03.489,Are you going to help me now or not?
00:38:03.531,00:38:05.324,"Of course, we are."
00:38:05.366,00:38:09.204,Medical alert transmitted.
00:38:09.246,00:38:11.831,Just wait in here.
00:38:19.839,00:38:20.924,Clones!
00:38:41.402,00:38:43.362,He had a good laugh when he read that story.
00:38:55.041,00:38:57.543,"You know, he saw himself at his house tonight."
00:38:57.585,00:38:59.171,"Which was our mistake, not his."
00:38:59.212,00:39:00.546,-Excuse me.
00:39:02.215,00:39:03.967,He's in precinct seven.
00:39:04.009,00:39:06.845,"Could you hurry Talia and Wiley along, please?"
00:40:20.793,00:40:22.962,God damn it! Son of a bitch!
00:40:32.471,00:40:34.557,"Piece of shit, Wiley."
00:40:34.599,00:40:36.017,I'm gonna kill him.
00:40:39.687,00:40:41.356,Son of a bitch.
00:40:49.072,00:40:51.283,I look like crap.
00:40:51.324,00:40:54.369,Do you have any idea how much my hair treatments cost?
00:40:54.411,00:40:56.037,How much does Gibson know?
00:40:56.079,00:40:58.081,He knows he's been cloned.
00:40:58.123,00:41:00.417,He knows we'll kill anyone who sees them together.
00:41:00.458,00:41:03.211,What's that? What?
00:41:03.253,00:41:07.299,Does Drucker know you're talking about killing innocent people?
00:41:07.340,00:41:11.010,"Relax, it was just a threat."
00:41:13.096,00:41:14.680,Try to have a good night.
00:41:14.722,00:41:18.517,You do your hair.
00:41:18.559,00:41:20.228,I've gotta pierce my damn ears again.
00:41:23.648,00:41:33.116,"Officials blame the latest strike by US major league players now entering its fourth year, on the lack of fan identification with the two teams playing in the series."
00:41:36.119,00:41:36.953,Shit.
00:42:05.106,00:42:07.775,Now what?
00:42:07.817,00:42:11.488,It feels tight all across here where the tires ran over me.
00:42:11.529,00:42:13.072,You know?
00:42:13.114,00:42:16.034,You were run over by two cars and your chest was crushed.
00:42:16.075,00:42:17.660,Exactly.
00:42:17.702,00:42:20.372,"-No wonder, right?"
00:42:20.413,00:42:24.583,"Completely crushed, as in dead."
00:42:24.625,00:42:28.629,"As in, you have a totally new chest now."
00:42:28.671,00:42:30.256,Then how come it's hard to breathe?
00:42:31.966,00:42:33.176,Tell you what.
00:42:33.218,00:42:36.137,"Why don't you just stay out here, relax?"
00:42:36.179,00:42:37.514,Fresh air will do you good.
00:42:39.682,00:42:45.438,"officials in Washington, D.C., are openly dismissive of the Microsoft proposal."
00:42:45.480,00:42:50.360,to an attempt by Microsoft to buy a state of the union.
00:43:06.792,00:43:11.839,"But if he goes off his medication, the paranoid delusions come back."
00:43:17.387,00:43:22.350,"Very sad, because at other times he seems almost rational."
00:44:06.936,00:44:08.605,-You're dead.
00:44:06.936,00:44:10.731,"-No, you're dead."
00:44:21.159,00:44:23.119,Try to stay dead this time.
00:44:31.877,00:44:35.340,"Hank, it's me again."
00:44:35.381,00:44:37.925,I waited for over a half an hour at Kelly's.
00:44:37.967,00:44:41.596,It's now five past seven.
00:44:46.058,00:44:48.520,"Whoa, whoa. He's fine."
00:44:48.561,00:44:50.522,He's okay. He's our associate.
00:44:50.563,00:44:52.106,Gibson must've knocked him out.
00:44:52.148,00:44:54.900,Knocked him out?
00:44:57.153,00:44:59.280,"No, his pulse is strong."
00:44:59.322,00:45:00.573,He'll be up and around in no time.
00:45:00.615,00:45:04.243,We'll just get him to the hospital.
00:45:04.285,00:45:06.287,Easy with the head.
00:45:07.704,00:45:10.333,"Uh, let us know if you find Gibson."
00:45:13.670,00:45:15.046,"Honey, I'm home."
00:45:18.090,00:45:19.758,"Darling, where are you?"
00:45:19.800,00:45:20.968,"Hi, sugar."
00:45:21.010,00:45:22.053,"Hello, my love."
00:45:22.094,00:45:23.846,Have you been working out?
00:45:27.850,00:45:30.019,-You look so good.
00:45:30.061,00:45:32.146,I recorded all your sports programs for you.
00:45:32.188,00:45:35.816,-I thought maybe we could watch them together.
00:45:35.858,00:45:37.902,Or should I just take this off right now?
00:45:39.070,00:45:40.655,"No, no, no. Hold your horses."
00:45:48.037,00:45:49.706,"Oh, Hank."
00:45:49.746,00:45:52.625,I think it's so sexy when you go right to the chair.
00:45:52.667,00:45:53.626,I know you do.
00:45:59.298,00:46:01.384,"Oh, you're gonna have to zip me up, sweetheart."
00:46:03.302,00:46:06.013,"Ah, ah, ah. Careful with the merchandise."
00:46:09.517,00:46:10.935,"-Hold on, please."
00:46:14.564,00:46:17.066,-Have they been here?
00:46:17.108,00:46:19.026,"Hello, Adam."
00:46:21.946,00:46:24.490,"I missed the party, but..."
00:46:24.532,00:46:29.078,All of a sudden it's 11:00 and I wound up at Kelly's.
00:46:29.120,00:46:32.039,-You missed my party?
00:46:32.081,00:46:35.167,It was sort of weird.
00:46:35.209,00:46:36.335,I don't know what happened.
00:46:36.377,00:46:37.878,You feel terrible?
00:46:37.920,00:46:40.673,"I lost my wife, my daughter, my whole goddamn life tonight."
00:46:40.715,00:46:43.635,-I'm gonna do my special dance.
00:46:43.676,00:46:45.720,-I need your help.
00:46:45.762,00:46:49.848,"Hey, not now, cupcake, I can't-- What's going on?"
00:46:47.472,00:46:50.933,I don't understand. What-- -Shh!
00:46:52.727,00:46:53.978,-That's a real gun.
00:46:55.647,00:46:57.022,"-Well, what's going-- -Shh!"
00:47:09.243,00:47:11.621,"Jesus Christ! What are you gonna do, kill my cat?"
00:47:12.497,00:47:14.457,What the hell is going on?
00:47:14.499,00:47:19.253,"If you weren't at my party tonight, -then you didn't see him."
00:47:37.772,00:47:40.899,"I said get your dog cloned, not yourself."
00:47:41.818,00:47:43.068,What are you gonna do?
00:47:44.320,00:47:45.988,I'm gonna take my life back.
00:47:46.030,00:47:47.615,"What, you're gonna kill him?"
00:47:47.657,00:47:49.200,Why not? He's not real.
00:47:49.241,00:47:51.160,"Plus, there's no law against it."
00:47:51.202,00:47:52.578,"You're not serious, are you?"
00:47:52.620,00:47:54.038,I'm dead serious.
00:47:56.582,00:47:58.917,"I mean, he looks just like you."
00:47:58.959,00:48:02.630,"I mean, technically, this could be committing suicide."
00:48:02.672,00:48:05.800,But he is not me.
00:48:05.842,00:48:10.054,Wait a sec.
00:48:10.095,00:48:12.557,"I mean, look at him."
00:48:14.559,00:48:16.519,"-Well, let me see your chin."
00:48:16.561,00:48:19.021,"-Yeah, you cut yourself shaving, right?"
00:48:21.148,00:48:23.401,"Okay, it's there. You're you."
00:48:23.442,00:48:24.318,Shh!
00:48:30.991,00:48:31.992,Adam.
00:48:53.848,00:48:55.182,I couldn't do it.
00:48:57.351,00:48:58.436,Over here.
00:49:02.899,00:49:05.234,a little something for you.
00:49:05.276,00:49:07.403,"-Oh, yes she is."
00:49:15.745,00:49:17.037,He's grabbing her ass.
00:49:17.079,00:49:19.540,how cigars make you feel.
00:49:20.374,00:49:22.418,-Ooh.
00:49:35.431,00:49:36.891,What are you doing out here?
00:49:39.518,00:49:43.481,"Oh, I'll take you back to bed, okay? Come on."
00:49:43.522,00:49:44.899,Fireman.
00:49:44.941,00:49:46.275,"Fireman, right."
00:49:47.777,00:49:48.778,Wait here.
00:49:48.820,00:49:49.862,Okay.
00:49:53.157,00:49:54.366,"Cigar, sir?"
00:49:56.160,00:49:57.244,I can't wait.
00:50:02.207,00:50:03.793,-Mmm.
00:50:03.835,00:50:06.128,-How do you like it?
00:50:06.170,00:50:09.590,-You want to try some?
00:50:18.516,00:50:21.936,I'm so sorry about the RePet.
00:50:21.978,00:50:24.271,It's all right. It's okay.
00:50:24.313,00:50:26.732,"Dad, did Oliver die?"
00:50:27.733,00:50:29.025,Is he a RePet?
00:50:30.194,00:50:31.320,Why do you say that?
00:50:31.362,00:50:33.322,You locked him outside.
00:50:33.364,00:50:34.824,I did?
00:50:34.866,00:50:38.285,"Oh, I'm so sorry, but I haven't been myself lately."
00:50:51.507,00:50:53.509,All right.
00:50:53.551,00:50:56.012,"You go to sleep now, okay?"
00:50:57.930,00:51:01.767,When was the last time we did it in the backseat of the car?
00:51:01.809,00:51:03.978,"Well, we should smoke cigars more often."
00:51:18.910,00:51:20.244,Mr. Gibson.
00:51:20.285,00:51:22.413,-Who are you?
00:51:22.454,00:51:24.540,"-Sorry to bother you, sir, but-- -Got any ID?"
00:51:25.249,00:51:26.166,Of course.
00:51:29.461,00:51:32.882,"Sorry I was a little jumpy, but we had a break-in earlier tonight."
00:51:32.924,00:51:36.552,We know. We heard on the wire your car was found in the river.
00:51:36.594,00:51:38.679,I don't suppose they found that bastard that stole it?
00:51:38.721,00:51:40.472,"-Hey, hey, whoa, whoa."
00:51:40.514,00:51:41.766,Relax. He's a friend of mine.
00:51:45.227,00:51:47.563,Nice 'do.
00:51:47.605,00:51:50.566,"He's just here to help me fix the garage. Oliver, heel!"
00:51:51.525,00:51:52.693,Now what?
00:51:53.527,00:51:54.737,Go see.
00:51:54.779,00:51:56.447,"I'm so sorry, but he's a RePet."
00:51:56.488,00:51:58.198,He used to be a really good watchdog.
00:51:58.240,00:52:01.953,"Now, he lets my car get stolen and he barks at security guards."
00:52:01.994,00:52:03.037,I hate clones.
00:52:06.082,00:52:08.250,"Well, sir, we'll keep an eye on your property."
00:52:11.462,00:52:14.090,"Oh, I'm gonna sleep much better knowing you guys are around."
00:52:14.130,00:52:15.591,You try to have a good night.
00:52:15.633,00:52:17.843,-Good night.
00:52:24.767,00:52:26.142,"Come on, let's hide."
00:52:31.482,00:52:32.691,"Stop it, Oliver."
00:52:37.655,00:52:38.697,Stop it.
00:52:43.911,00:52:46.705,"Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on."
00:52:59.301,00:53:02.096,Good Oliver.
00:53:04.473,00:53:06.017,Let's get out of here.
00:53:06.058,00:53:08.686,"Wait, we can't just leave them here with that-that thing."
00:53:13.691,00:53:15.860,Those were the guys that were trying to kill me.
00:53:15.901,00:53:18.779,It's dangerous for Natalie and Clara if I hang around here.
00:53:28.873,00:53:30.791,"Darling, you're still awake?"
00:53:32.459,00:53:34.003,I wanted to wait up for you.
00:53:35.129,00:53:36.505,Thank you.
00:53:36.547,00:53:38.298,And I wanted to spend some time with these flowers.
00:53:38.340,00:53:39.550,I see.
00:53:39.591,00:53:41.760,Took me 17 generations to get this right.
00:53:41.802,00:53:45.221,"Well, if you told me what you wanted-- Oh, I know."
00:53:45.263,00:53:47.307,-You could have engineered it in half an hour.
00:53:49.309,00:53:51.520,"I'm not in that much of a hurry, Griffin."
00:53:54.190,00:53:56.316,Want to get a cup of tea and then go upstairs?
00:53:56.358,00:53:59.235,-Hmm? Okay?
00:53:59.277,00:54:01.197,"Yeah, that's a good idea, let's do that."
00:54:02.364,00:54:03.407,Yeah.
00:54:05.034,00:54:06.118,"Oh, dear."
00:54:09.747,00:54:11.707,Okay. It's okay.
00:54:13.000,00:54:15.544,Shh. Just stay calm.
00:54:17.088,00:54:19.048,"Stay very, very calm."
00:54:19.090,00:54:22.426,-What a night.
00:54:26.931,00:54:30.809,"Hello, Adam."
00:54:30.851,00:54:36.314,But if you insert the installation disk-- -What the hell was that?
00:54:36.356,00:54:38.776,I felt fingers going for my zipper.
00:54:38.817,00:54:41.486,"-Now, that's disgusting."
00:54:41.528,00:54:48.619,"I had to totally look away when you and Natalie were-- The, uh-- You want a beer?"
00:54:48.660,00:54:52.248,"You saw the clone do something with Natalie while I took Clara into the house, didn't you?"
00:54:52.288,00:54:53.540,They did nothing.
00:54:53.582,00:54:56.127,Come on. That's not what I would have done.
00:54:56.168,00:54:57.502,"Well, what would you have done?"
00:54:57.544,00:55:04.551,I would have-- -Nothing.
00:55:04.593,00:55:06.511,"You know, nothing."
00:55:06.553,00:55:09.514,Shit! In the goddamn minivan.
00:55:09.556,00:55:11.225,In the minivan.
00:55:11.267,00:55:13.769,"I mean, you know what tobacco does to people."
00:55:13.811,00:55:15.271,"He smoked my stogie, too?"
00:55:16.272,00:55:17.522,The bastard.
00:55:17.564,00:55:19.066,"Oh, that son of a bitch."
00:55:19.108,00:55:22.569,Son of a bitch.
00:55:22.611,00:55:24.529,And she couldn't tell it wasn't me?
00:55:24.571,00:55:26.073,It didn't look like it.
00:55:26.115,00:55:29.201,"I mean, she seemed, uh, happy."
00:55:30.744,00:55:34.039,"Oh, you have no idea what it felt like seeing her with him."
00:55:34.081,00:55:36.332,I should've just killed that son of a bitch when I had the chance.
00:55:36.374,00:55:38.210,It could have been worse.
00:55:38.252,00:55:52.766,"It could have been someone else. I mean, at least she's not cheating-- Back away."
00:55:56.103,00:55:57.479,Back away!
00:55:58.605,00:56:00.149,Why did you do that?
00:56:00.191,00:56:03.652,Don't do anything stupid now.
00:56:05.779,00:56:07.031,"Is that you, Hank?"
00:56:37.686,00:56:38.562,Hank.
00:56:43.317,00:56:45.110,"Hey, Adam."
00:56:45.152,00:56:47.988,Is Hank sleeping on the floor again?
00:56:48.697,00:56:50.532,That's so cute.
00:57:12.930,00:57:23.732,"On the six-- On the sixth-- On the sixth day God created-- On the sixth day, God created man."
00:57:23.774,00:57:25.692,God created man on the sixth day.
00:57:27.485,00:57:29.071,Why the hell did you kill my friend?
00:57:30.155,00:57:33.284,Hank Morgan was an abomination to God.
00:57:34.285,00:57:35.744,He was a clone.
00:57:35.786,00:57:37.288,Hank was no clone.
00:57:37.329,00:57:39.164,The real Hank Morgan died this afternoon.
00:57:40.916,00:57:43.127,I know because I killed him...
00:57:43.168,00:57:46.171,So I could kill Drucker.
00:57:46.213,00:57:48.882,Drucker's not dead.
00:57:48.924,00:57:50.342,Open your eyes.
00:57:51.260,00:57:52.594,Drucker's a clone.
00:57:52.636,00:57:56.974,Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
00:57:58.558,00:57:59.851,Dr. Weir cloned you.
00:58:06.066,00:58:08.444,They found us. They found us.
00:58:08.485,00:58:11.322,-Shoot me in the head.
00:58:11.363,00:58:14.283,We have people at Weir's lab.
00:58:14.325,00:58:15.826,"If they scan my brain, they'll be killed."
00:58:18.245,00:58:19.330,Shoot me!
00:58:19.997,00:58:20.998,God forgive me.
00:59:46.417,00:59:48.460,Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?
00:59:49.961,00:59:51.588,Who are you people?
00:59:59.137,01:00:06.853,Please use biometric reader to verify identification or the alarm will sound in ten seconds.
01:00:06.895,01:00:09.231,"-Ten, nine..."
01:00:09.273,01:00:11.942,"Eight, seven, six, five..."
01:00:11.983,01:00:13.235,Son of a bitch!
01:00:13.902,01:00:19.283,"Four, three, two, one, stand by."
01:00:19.324,01:00:20.158,Come on.
01:00:22.077,01:00:23.745,Systems accessed.
01:00:24.246,01:00:25.330,Gibson.
01:00:25.372,01:00:27.124,-Gibson!
01:00:32.087,01:00:32.921,Shit!
01:00:35.340,01:00:36.841,You're gonna pay!
01:00:36.883,01:00:38.469,Those were brand-new boots!
01:01:48.622,01:01:51.333,"Dad, you're coming to my recital, right?"
01:01:51.375,01:01:53.210,"Of course, I never miss your recitals."
01:01:54.294,01:01:55.629,I love you.
01:01:55.671,01:01:57.589,"You're the greatest, Dad."
01:02:06.515,01:02:11.853,"her pseudomonas infection clears up, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do."
01:02:14.856,01:02:16.316,What about her DNA scan?
01:02:17.651,01:02:20.153,It came up with cystic fibrosis.
01:02:21.321,01:02:27.369,Which of course is impossible considering that it's a childhood disease and she would have been dead 30 years ago.
01:02:27.411,01:02:28.828,We're running the scan again.
01:02:30.622,01:02:32.249,"No, I'll do it at the clinic."
01:02:32.290,01:02:34.668,"If you could give us a moment, please. Thank you very much."
01:02:36.002,01:02:38.547,"Darling, sweetheart."
01:02:38.589,01:02:40.924,"We're having you transferred to my clinic, okay?"
01:02:41.799,01:02:44.302,No. I'd like to stay here.
01:02:44.344,01:02:47.556,No. But I can help you at the clinic.
01:02:47.598,01:02:49.433,"If you stay here, there's nothing I can do."
01:02:49.474,01:02:51.184,"I know, dear."
01:02:51.226,01:02:53.270,-I'll die here.
01:02:53.311,01:02:55.021,"Katherine, please."
01:02:55.063,01:02:56.940,Please listen to me.
01:02:56.981,01:03:00.151,Katherine died five years ago.
01:03:00.193,01:03:03.655,"The feelings that I have aren't mine, they're hers."
01:03:09.411,01:03:11.079,"Katherine, listen."
01:03:13.123,01:03:14.332,Now don't do this.
01:03:14.999,01:03:16.501,I need you so much.
01:03:17.252,01:03:18.378,I need you.
01:03:20.004,01:03:21.465,"I'm not afraid, Griffin."
01:03:23.007,01:03:24.509,I want to die.
01:03:25.343,01:03:27.471,My time has already passed.
01:03:32.601,01:03:35.145,What am I to do without you?
01:03:35.186,01:03:43.528,"-What-- You just water my flowers, okay?"
01:03:58.543,01:04:02.547,Replacement Technologies.
01:04:04.841,01:04:09.012,of the Weir Organ Transplant Facility here at Replacement Technologies.
01:04:22.442,01:04:24.444,"Excuse me, sir."
01:04:26.279,01:04:28.782,"Oh, sure. Help yourself."
01:04:30.534,01:04:33.286,But you might want to use these.
01:04:33.328,01:04:34.371,Why? What's in here?
01:04:34.412,01:04:36.164,Lower intestines.
01:04:36.206,01:04:39.459,"It's for Dr. Weir, he's doing a study on a flesh-eating virus."
01:04:39.501,01:04:41.169,"That's okay, you can open it up."
01:04:41.211,01:04:43.505,Just try not to breathe.
01:04:46.717,01:04:48.635,That's okay.
01:04:48.677,01:04:50.887,-Go ahead. You're cleared.
01:05:01.732,01:05:03.233,What about her DNA scan?
01:05:04.776,01:05:06.361,with cystic fibrosis.
01:05:06.403,01:05:10.365,"Which, of course, is impossible, considering that it's a childhood disease."
01:05:10.407,01:05:14.035,She should have been dead 30 years ago.
01:05:14.077,01:05:19.541,"So we're running at my clinic, okay?"
01:05:22.335,01:05:25.004,You've had five extra years since you cloned me.
01:05:26.005,01:05:27.799,I treasure that.
01:05:27.841,01:05:30.176,"-Katherine, please. Please."
01:05:31.219,01:05:32.763,I'm not afraid.
01:05:33.597,01:05:34.972,I want to die.
01:05:36.266,01:05:38.518,My time has already passed.
01:06:46.586,01:06:47.921,-Can I help you?
01:06:50.131,01:06:52.926,"Uh, no, I just dropped my pen."
01:06:55.136,01:06:56.638,I'm all thumbs today.
01:07:01.768,01:07:02.936,Thank you.
01:07:14.614,01:07:17.158,Will you cut that out?
01:07:17.200,01:07:21.412,"Excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts like hell."
01:07:21.454,01:07:24.332,It's only psychological.
01:07:24.374,01:07:26.001,"Oh, yeah? You'd know better about that?"
01:07:26.042,01:07:27.335,"Yes, he would, Wiley."
01:07:27.377,01:07:29.253,It was your old neck that got broken.
01:07:29.295,01:07:31.798,This is your new neck. Get it?
01:07:31.840,01:07:35.677,"Give me a break, I got killed twice -in two hours."
01:07:36.678,01:07:38.680,You know what bothers me?
01:07:38.722,01:07:40.348,I've never even seen a white light.
01:07:41.307,01:07:42.559,Never seen any angels.
01:07:42.600,01:07:44.227,-Nothing.
01:07:51.359,01:07:54.404,"-Ma'am, I already have you logged in."
01:07:55.030,01:07:56.406,Twenty minutes ago.
01:07:56.447,01:07:58.700,"According to this, you just entered a restricted area."
01:07:58.742,01:08:00.744,Son of a bitch has got my thumb.
01:08:00.785,01:08:04.622,"Deactivate Talia, put out a security alert and seal off Drucker's office now."
01:08:04.664,01:08:05.498,Let's go.
01:08:24.851,01:08:25.685,Can I help you?
01:08:26.519,01:08:27.896,Yeah.
01:08:27.938,01:08:29.522,You can stick your thumb in there.
01:08:58.259,01:09:00.971,-Thank God.
01:09:01.012,01:09:03.848,"No, Adam Gibson."
01:09:03.890,01:09:05.850,Why wasn't he taken care of already? You've had all night.
01:09:13.024,01:09:15.526,There are four of you and one of him.
01:09:15.568,01:09:17.278,"Well, two of him, if you see what I mean."
01:09:18.738,01:09:20.239,"He has a wife and kid, right?"
01:09:20.281,01:09:22.158,-Get them.
01:09:22.199,01:09:23.618,"-Yes, sir."
01:09:22.199,01:09:26.121,"-You know, it costs me 1.2 million each time I clone you people."
01:09:26.162,01:09:27.538,Try to be worth the money.
01:09:52.522,01:09:54.816,kill you for seeing this.
01:09:54.858,01:09:57.068,They're doing their best already.
01:09:57.110,01:09:58.153,Where's Dr. Weir?
01:09:59.946,01:10:01.280,His lab's over there.
01:10:11.541,01:10:15.920,"Oh, I know about the intruder."
01:10:18.882,01:10:20.550,It's not under control.
01:10:23.511,01:10:24.804,You had me cloned.
01:10:28.016,01:10:29.142,Yes.
01:10:29.184,01:10:30.727,"Well, you cloned the wrong man."
01:10:31.811,01:10:33.188,How did you do it?
01:10:33.229,01:10:35.065,"You had to have my, uh-- What do you call it?"
01:10:35.106,01:10:36.983,Your syncording.
01:10:37.025,01:10:39.903,Give it to me.
01:10:52.289,01:10:54.125,"Here, it's your syncording."
01:10:55.919,01:10:57.045,How did you get this?
01:10:58.629,01:11:00.048,-I haven't been-- -Here.
01:11:05.553,01:11:07.097,The vision test.
01:11:07.138,01:11:09.306,Only it didn't test your vision.
01:11:09.348,01:11:11.101,An exact picture of your mind.
01:11:11.142,01:11:16.272,"And it took a sample of your DNA and with those two things, we can clone a person in two hours."
01:11:16.313,01:11:20.568,"We had you on file, so to speak, so that we could act quickly when we were told you were killed."
01:11:21.527,01:11:22.820,Told I was killed?
01:11:48.596,01:11:50.223,"Please, don't drink and drive."
01:11:52.100,01:11:53.893,Gibson family schedule.
01:11:53.935,01:11:55.436,Clara's recital at school.
01:12:00.191,01:12:03.278,This is Michael Drucker's.
01:12:03.319,01:12:09.993,"A syncording contains everything in a person's memory, and this is what Drucker saw and heard just before he died."
01:12:10.034,01:12:15.331,"You don't become one of the richest men in the world without making enemies, so we back up his mind religiously."
01:12:24.132,01:12:25.883,"Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?"
01:12:25.925,01:12:27.468,Amongst other things. Yeah.
01:12:27.510,01:12:29.804,-You a fan?
01:12:29.846,01:12:31.973,to get you some tickets.
01:12:32.015,01:12:34.851,"-You promise, right?"
01:12:36.769,01:12:38.521,"Yeah, remind me to get some comp Roadrunner tickets for Adam Gibson."
01:12:38.562,01:12:41.065,He's my pilot today. Okay.
01:12:41.107,01:12:42.566,"On the sixth day, God created man."
01:12:42.608,01:12:44.319,God created man on the sixth day.
01:12:44.360,01:12:46.070,I'm about to get on my snowboard.
01:12:46.112,01:12:47.864,"Hey, he's got a gun!"
01:12:48.239,01:12:49.073,Hey!
01:12:51.326,01:12:53.870,It's a fundamentalist.
01:12:53.911,01:12:56.622,"You hear me, Sally?"
01:12:56.664,01:12:58.374,"No, you don't have to-- Sally!"
01:13:01.085,01:13:04.088,An anti-cloning fundamentalist killed everyone on board.
01:13:06.049,01:13:07.175,It should have been me.
01:13:07.217,01:13:08.718,"Well, we thought it was you."
01:13:08.759,01:13:10.594,Drucker even mentioned your name.
01:13:10.636,01:13:13.639,So we used your DNA and your syncording to clone you.
01:13:13.681,01:13:15.975,To resurrect Drucker we had to cover up the accident.
01:13:16.017,01:13:17.768,Keep talking.
01:13:17.810,01:13:20.563,We cloned everyone.
01:13:17.810,01:13:22.106,"By the time we figured out you switched places, it was too late."
01:13:22.148,01:13:23.983,Access denied.
01:13:24.025,01:13:25.193,They're trying to kill me.
01:13:25.235,01:13:26.861,Because there are two Adam Gibsons.
01:13:26.903,01:13:28.946,And that's proof that humans are being cloned.
01:13:28.988,01:13:31.324,Which makes you very dangerous to Michael Drucker.
01:13:31.366,01:13:34.493,-Accessing security.
01:13:34.535,01:13:36.120,Drucker was killed three years ago.
01:13:36.162,01:13:39.332,We cloned him then and we cloned him yesterday.
01:13:39.374,01:13:41.084,So?
01:13:41.125,01:13:42.919,"Well, if that came out, Drucker would be destroyed in every way."
01:13:45.421,01:13:47.048,A clone can't own anything.
01:13:47.090,01:13:48.799,Drucker would lose all of this. Everything.
01:13:48.841,01:13:52.345,Because Drucker would be legally dead.
01:13:52.387,01:13:54.138,Complete search from level...
01:13:54.180,01:13:55.014,-...seven to level five.
01:13:54.180,01:13:57.058,"the cameras you got in this place, hmm."
01:13:57.100,01:14:00.436,-Hmm? You can't even find one guy?
01:14:00.477,01:14:02.272,-and right above.
01:14:02.313,01:14:03.731,We need to find out where he is now.
01:14:10.613,01:14:12.531,Let's go. Hit the alarm.
01:14:12.573,01:14:16.452,-What's up?
01:14:16.493,01:14:18.079,will do anything...
01:14:18.121,01:14:19.747,Anything to destroy the evidence.
01:14:21.249,01:14:22.917,And you're the evidence.
01:14:24.961,01:14:26.670,"This is evidence, too."
01:14:26.712,01:14:28.047,"-Move, move! Clear the way!"
01:14:29.632,01:14:30.591,Let's go.
01:14:41.852,01:14:44.230,"Oh, no, no. She's been rehearsing all week."
01:14:45.815,01:14:48.401,-I have to go to the bathroom.
01:14:48.443,01:14:50.194,Anyone else need to go to the bathroom?
01:15:00.330,01:15:02.290,Why do you think I'm telling you all this?
01:15:02.332,01:15:05.042,It's because I can do nothing to stop what they're trying to do to you.
01:15:05.084,01:15:08.004,"-Zone six, engineering corridor."
01:15:08.045,01:15:10.506,"Move, move! Clear the way!"
01:15:10.547,01:15:12.216,And what they might be trying to do to your family.
01:15:12.258,01:15:14.135,What about my family?
01:15:14.177,01:15:15.594,Drucker has to kill one of you.
01:15:15.636,01:15:18.306,"If he can't kill you, he'll go for the other one."
01:15:18.348,01:15:20.516,And your family could get killed in the process.
01:15:21.684,01:15:23.227,Get out.
01:15:23.269,01:15:25.688,Destination Get Out not understood.
01:15:25.729,01:15:27.440,Morgan Randall Elementary School.
01:15:42.705,01:15:44.332,"Very sorry, sir."
01:16:05.895,01:16:07.813,-Daddy!
01:16:07.855,01:16:09.565,"She's supposed to be up there now, right?"
01:16:11.234,01:16:14.695,"-This is the, uh-- -That's odd."
01:16:14.737,01:16:17.114,I'm just gonna go check and make sure everything's okay. Okay?
01:16:17.156,01:16:18.032,All right.
01:16:19.200,01:16:20.368,-Excuse me.
01:16:23.120,01:16:24.163,Clara!
01:16:30.961,01:16:31.879,"Oh, my God."
01:16:32.547,01:16:33.548,Mommy?
01:16:34.465,01:16:35.799,"Mommy, I'm scared."
01:16:35.841,01:16:38.177,I'm here. I've got you.
01:16:41.055,01:16:42.265,"Could you help us, please?"
01:16:45.184,01:16:46.060,What are you doing?
01:16:46.477,01:16:48.104,See this?
01:16:48.145,01:16:50.814,It's the only thing keeping the dogs from tearing her apart.
01:16:50.856,01:16:52.525,So be quiet and come with us.
01:17:11.127,01:17:12.336,-Daddy!
01:17:12.378,01:17:13.212,Adam!
01:17:19.135,01:17:20.261,Natalie!
01:17:39.614,01:17:40.615,No.
01:17:44.243,01:17:46.703,You have reached 911 police emergency.
01:17:46.745,01:17:48.956,-Your call is important to us.
01:17:48.998,01:17:54.128,Your yes or no answers will help us in directing police services to assist you.
01:17:54.170,01:17:55.796,-Come on!
01:17:55.838,01:17:57.798,-Yes.
01:17:55.838,01:17:59.550,-Thank you for reporting -a felony.
01:17:59.592,01:18:03.053,-Is the felony in progress now?
01:18:03.095,01:18:04.680,Thank you.
01:18:04.721,01:18:07.600,Is there a current danger of bodily harm to you or others?
01:18:07.642,01:18:11.395,-Yes!
01:18:11.437,01:18:15.024,Forget about talking to the police.
01:18:17.985,01:18:23.073,"I know this sounds insane, but I'm Adam Gibson."
01:18:23.115,01:18:24.867,-What?
01:18:23.115,01:18:27.703,-But we don't have enough time for you to be shocked right now because they got Natalie and Clara.
01:18:27.744,01:18:30.831,-And I need your help to get my family back.
01:18:35.127,01:18:37.046,That's for sleeping with my wife...
01:18:38.506,01:18:39.465,In the damn minivan.
01:18:39.507,01:18:44.595,Your yes or no answers-- Your report has been timed out or canceled at your request.
01:18:44.637,01:18:47.306,Replacement Technologies...
01:18:49.475,01:18:51.435,It's him.
01:18:51.477,01:18:53.937,"Mr. Gibson, I believe you have something of mine."
01:18:53.979,01:18:57.316,"Oh, no. I have everything of yours."
01:18:57.358,01:19:00.152,I have the syncording that proves you are a clone.
01:19:00.194,01:19:04.781,And I have everything of yours. Your family in the palm of my hand.
01:19:04.823,01:19:07.493,-Shall we trade?
01:19:07.535,01:19:10.829,-Just the highlights.
01:19:10.871,01:19:15.334,I'll bring the disk to the Double X Charter office at 10:00 tonight.
01:19:15.376,01:19:16.919,Be there with my family.
01:19:26.387,01:19:28.681,Did you have to hit me that hard?
01:19:28.723,01:19:31.392,"Well, I had to stop you from talking to the police."
01:19:31.434,01:19:32.476,"Yeah, that's a good one."
01:19:33.686,01:19:34.978,That should do it.
01:19:37.273,01:19:39.066,What are you doing?
01:19:39.108,01:19:42.403,Testing it.
01:19:42.445,01:19:44.154,Are you kidding me?
01:19:44.196,01:19:47.617,That's exactly the same amount they used in the Rainforest War.
01:19:47.658,01:19:51.328,You shouldn't be talking.
01:19:52.496,01:19:54.248,You saw me working on the garage?
01:19:54.290,01:19:56.709,Saw you? I nearly shot you.
01:20:01.547,01:20:02.632,Let's try it.
01:20:16.479,01:20:17.313,Wow!
01:20:26.947,01:20:29.700,You'd better be miles away when this thing goes off.
01:20:29.742,01:20:33.704,I'm more worried about getting us into the building to find Natalie and Clara.
01:20:33.746,01:20:35.539,I'll take my chances getting out.
01:20:38.875,01:20:40.836,-Griffin.
01:20:42.129,01:20:44.799,-What are you doing?
01:20:45.633,01:20:46.592,"Griffin, what's the matter?"
01:20:48.093,01:20:50.262,"My wife, Katherine, is dead."
01:20:50.304,01:20:51.764,"Oh, Jesus Christ."
01:20:53.641,01:20:57.144,"Griffin, I don't know-- I'm so sorry."
01:20:57.186,01:20:58.813,-Don't start with sorry.
01:20:58.854,01:21:00.356,Don't start! Don't start!
01:21:00.397,01:21:02.232,Don't start with sorry!
01:21:03.567,01:21:08.447,"Now, I know about the congenital defects you've been embedding into the clone DNA."
01:21:08.489,01:21:10.741,"There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix and the others."
01:21:10.783,01:21:14.411,"But, Michael,why my wife? Why?"
01:21:14.453,01:21:15.830,"You're right, Griffin."
01:21:18.415,01:21:22.670,It's a security protocol I implemented and I didn't tell you about it because I knew you wouldn't understand.
01:21:22.712,01:21:24.839,What should I understand?
01:21:24.880,01:21:26.674,The only thing I understand is that...
01:21:27.717,01:21:29.802,You gave my wife cystic fibrosis.
01:21:29.844,01:21:31.721,"Griffin, calm down."
01:21:31.762,01:21:34.515,Someone made a mistake.
01:21:34.557,01:21:36.016,"Oh, it didn't hurt her, it just killed her."
01:21:36.058,01:21:37.601,Listen to me.
01:21:36.058,01:21:39.645,Suppose we clone a senator who's agreed to support us but he goes back on his word.
01:21:39.687,01:21:42.481,-What's the point?
01:21:42.523,01:21:46.109,"By giving them shorter life spans, -we guarantee our leverage."
01:21:46.151,01:21:47.444,The point is...
01:21:47.486,01:21:49.613,"If they betray us, they're dead."
01:21:49.655,01:21:52.491,"If they stay on the team, we clone them again and no harm done."
01:21:52.533,01:21:54.493,And that's exactly what we're gonna do with Katherine.
01:21:54.535,01:21:56.161,I'm sure she's being cloned as we speak.
01:21:56.203,01:21:57.287,"No, she's not."
01:21:58.414,01:21:59.832,"-No, she's-- -No."
01:22:00.999,01:22:03.627,"Griffin, it was a mistake."
01:22:03.669,01:22:07.506,"If you're concerned about her DNA, go through it yourself, make sure it's clean."
01:22:07.548,01:22:09.675,"And obviously, there won't be any charge for the cloning."
01:22:09.717,01:22:11.594,"Oh, no charge."
01:22:11.635,01:22:13.220,Thank you.
01:22:13.262,01:22:16.014,What you don't understand is she does not want to be cloned.
01:22:16.056,01:22:17.140,So you do it anyway.
01:22:18.058,01:22:21.604,Do it anyway? I see.
01:22:21.645,01:22:23.898,Let me explain something to you.
01:22:25.982,01:22:28.151,I loved my wife very much.
01:22:28.193,01:22:32.239,"So much so that I promised I would never bring her back again, and I won't."
01:22:33.616,01:22:36.744,"And if I can't bring her back again, I'll never bring back anyone ever again."
01:22:38.995,01:22:40.289,That's how much I loved her.
01:22:43.667,01:22:46.587,"So it's over, it's finished and I quit."
01:22:48.839,01:22:50.925,"-Well, I can't let you quit."
01:22:50.966,01:22:55.387,"I've looked the other way too often and I've justified too much, so..."
01:23:00.935,01:23:02.978,I'm finished. It's over.
01:23:07.608,01:23:08.943,"You know what I'm gonna do for you, Griffin?"
01:23:09.860,01:23:10.820,What are you gonna do for me?
01:23:12.237,01:23:17.117,I'm gonna give you the greatest gift that you could possibly imagine.
01:23:17.159,01:23:19.286,-A gift?
01:23:19.328,01:23:21.204,I'm gonna save Katherine's life.
01:23:21.246,01:23:23.582,I'm gonna save our friendship.
01:23:23.624,01:23:25.083,And I'm gonna save your marriage.
01:23:26.418,01:23:27.795,"Michael, what are you talking about?"
01:23:31.632,01:23:33.634,I'm going to kill you now.
01:23:33.676,01:23:37.262,And then I'm going to clone you using your latest syncording.
01:23:37.304,01:23:39.765,Then I'm gonna clone Katherine using her last syncording.
01:23:40.516,01:23:41.475,You understand?
01:23:43.018,01:23:44.269,Do you see what I'm doing for you?
01:23:45.395,01:23:49.900,You and Katherine will be back together and neither one of you will remember that you ever promised not to clone her.
01:23:49.942,01:23:51.902,Or that she even died.
01:23:51.944,01:23:54.196,"And obviously, you won't remember this conversation."
01:24:03.706,01:24:04.790,You're welcome.
01:24:28.146,01:24:30.399,Now show me my family.
01:25:29.291,01:25:31.167,isn't here and neither is he.
01:25:31.209,01:25:33.420,It was being flown by remote or something.
01:25:33.462,01:25:35.047,Both of you get back here now.
01:25:36.214,01:25:37.382,Come on.
01:25:50.104,01:25:53.649,This is a private pad.
01:25:53.690,01:25:55.275,I'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.
01:25:58.194,01:25:59.029,Here.
01:26:00.614,01:26:02.032,It's my charter contract.
01:26:03.492,01:26:04.451,Okay.
01:26:09.164,01:26:12.250,"Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker, but we'll stay alert."
01:26:12.292,01:26:14.003,What time are you planning to take off?
01:26:14.044,01:26:17.589,"Take off? No, I didn't-- Your pilot's on his way down to reception."
01:26:20.425,01:26:24.096,Now you listen to me.
01:26:24.138,01:26:26.765,You find this pilot.
01:26:28.224,01:26:31.020,"And get Wiley and some men up to my office, now."
01:26:31.061,01:26:33.522,Freeze the elevators and shut down level two and three parking garages.
01:26:33.563,01:26:35.190,Over there on monitor 12.
01:26:35.231,01:26:37.901,"-Yeah, Zone six, engineering corridor."
01:26:41.321,01:26:42.865,"He's headed right towards you, Dan."
01:26:42.906,01:26:44.407,"Turn around, turn around."
01:26:46.284,01:26:47.410,Don't even try it.
01:26:47.452,01:26:49.204,Get some people up that west stairwell.
01:26:51.999,01:26:54.459,"Team three and four, close up on him. Let's go."
01:27:12.477,01:27:14.229,He must have shot out a power box.
01:27:14.270,01:27:15.898,-He's trashing the whole security system.
01:27:14.270,01:27:19.026,"-All right, we've got him trapped."
01:27:33.165,01:27:34.374,Cover the stairwell doors!
01:27:39.295,01:27:40.714,Fire in front of him.
01:27:48.304,01:27:51.725,"Okay, you did pretty good."
01:27:51.767,01:27:54.144,You totally fooled us at the airport.
01:27:54.186,01:27:56.438,You managed to turn this place into shambles.
01:27:56.479,01:27:58.440,-Want to make us come up there and kill you?
01:27:58.481,01:27:59.858,Makes no difference to me.
01:28:01.860,01:28:04.238,But Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.
01:28:04.279,01:28:06.907,And of course we do have your family.
01:28:09.659,01:28:10.702,All right.
01:28:12.121,01:28:13.622,"Go get him, go get him. Go."
01:28:16.458,01:28:17.375,"Well, well."
01:28:19.628,01:28:21.588,Adam Gibson.
01:28:21.630,01:28:23.715,"I wish I could say, The one and only."
01:28:23.757,01:28:26.551,"Looks like we both went back on our word, didn't we?"
01:28:26.593,01:28:29.138,-You might find we have more in common than you thought.
01:28:30.346,01:28:33.683,Right to business.
01:28:37.187,01:28:38.438,There they are.
01:28:38.480,01:28:40.107,All safe and sound.
01:28:40.149,01:28:40.983,For the moment.
01:28:42.151,01:28:44.402,"And your syncording, it's not on him."
01:28:44.444,01:28:46.238,It's not in his Whispercraft.
01:28:59.709,01:29:03.297,"I knew you'd double-cross me, so I gave it to my clone."
01:29:03.338,01:29:09.178,"If anything happens to me or my family, the next time you'll see your syncording will be at your murder trial."
01:29:10.929,01:29:12.388,"Dr. Weir didn't tell you, did he?"
01:29:12.931,01:29:14.016,Tell me what?
01:29:16.101,01:29:17.936,"Adam, Adam, Adam."
01:29:21.106,01:29:22.398,He's not the clone.
01:29:26.153,01:29:27.112,You are.
01:29:30.282,01:29:32.742,I want you to ask yourself something.
01:29:32.784,01:29:36.121,Do you remember anything after being scanned by my bodyguard?
01:29:36.163,01:29:37.413,to check your vision.
01:29:37.455,01:29:38.957,Place your chin here.
01:29:38.999,01:29:41.584,Do you actually remember changing places with your friend?
01:29:41.626,01:29:44.296,"Hey, buddy, wake up."
01:29:45.714,01:29:50.384,"You know, the salesman at the RePet shop thought it was odd that you came in twice..."
01:29:51.803,01:29:54.014,Asked the same questions twice.
01:29:55.349,01:29:56.892,"Still can't make up your mind, huh?"
01:29:58.560,01:30:00.270,"You lost a dog, right?"
01:30:01.813,01:30:03.648,Let me see your chin.
01:30:03.690,01:30:05.817,-Hmm.
01:30:06.943,01:30:08.028,Your shaving cut?
01:30:09.196,01:30:10.572,Easily reproduced.
01:30:12.741,01:30:14.868,So was the scar from your old war wound.
01:30:18.163,01:30:19.413,I know who I am.
01:30:20.123,01:30:21.166,I know you do.
01:30:22.416,01:30:26.255,"Talia, how many times have you been cloned?"
01:30:26.296,01:30:28.131,I've lost count.
01:30:28.173,01:30:29.299,There's one way to tell.
01:30:30.884,01:30:31.885,Show him.
01:30:34.596,01:30:37.724,It's the only way to keep track of what generation a clone is.
01:30:37.766,01:30:42.145,See? Four dots means she's been cloned four times.
01:30:42.187,01:30:44.898,Come on. Let's take a look at yours.
01:30:46.400,01:30:48.026,Come take a look in the mirror.
01:30:48.068,01:30:50.404,Let's find out if you are who you think you are.
01:30:59.246,01:31:00.663,Just under your left eye.
01:31:14.636,01:31:16.972,"Kind of takes the fun out of being alive, doesn't it?"
01:31:19.057,01:31:25.314,"So you see, your family is not really your family, they're his."
01:31:25.355,01:31:28.358,"And you, my friend, are in exactly the same boat as all of us."
01:31:36.408,01:31:40.412,"If Adam Gibson gets that syncording to the authorities, we will all be destroyed."
01:31:41.913,01:31:47.627,"If you really love your wife and kid, you'll tell me where Adam Gibson is."
01:31:47.669,01:31:50.088,"We'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him."
01:31:51.423,01:31:53.883,Tell me where Adam Gibson is.
01:31:53.925,01:31:56.345,"We'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him."
01:31:56.386,01:31:59.473,"We'll get my syncording back, we'll get rid of him."
01:31:59.513,01:32:01.266,And they'll never have to know that you're the clone.
01:32:04.894,01:32:06.646,It's that or lose them forever.
01:32:06.688,01:32:10.275,"You know, Adam. I'm not making this offer because I have to."
01:32:10.317,01:32:13.111,I can get everything I need from your memories.
01:32:13.153,01:32:16.072,"The fact is, I'd like you to understand..."
01:32:16.114,01:32:24.206,"you'd also be serving In two years, three tops, I will control enough votes to get the laws changed."
01:32:24.247,01:32:27.959,And then we won't have to lose our best people. We won't have to lose our Mozarts.
01:32:28.001,01:32:30.295,We won't have to lose our Martin Luther Kings.
01:32:30.337,01:32:32.797,We will finally be able to conquer death.
01:32:35.217,01:32:37.427,We will finally be able to conquer death.
01:32:46.769,01:32:50.106,And who gets to decide who lives and who dies?
01:32:51.149,01:32:51.983,You?
01:32:52.859,01:32:54.486,You have a better idea?
01:32:54.528,01:32:57.155,"Yeah, what about God?"
01:32:57.197,01:33:01.701,"Oh, you're one of those."
01:33:01.743,01:33:05.621,"No, I don't think science is inherently evil."
01:33:05.663,01:33:08.250,But I think you are.
01:33:08.291,01:33:13.922,"If you believe that God created man in his own image, then you also believe that God gave man the power to understand evolution."
01:33:13.963,01:33:17.509,To exploit science.
01:33:17.551,01:33:19.302,To do exactly what I am doing.
01:33:20.470,01:33:22.556,I'm just taking over where God left off.
01:33:26.017,01:33:28.520,If you really believe that...
01:33:28.562,01:33:32.732,"Then you should clone yourself, while you're still alive."
01:33:32.774,01:33:36.570,And why's that?
01:33:36.610,01:33:38.988,No. So you can go fuck yourself.
01:33:46.329,01:33:49.791,Now you're gonna tell us where you put Mr. Drucker's syncording!
01:33:53.336,01:33:55.671,You won't find it in my head.
01:33:55.713,01:33:58.716,I told him to hide it so I wouldn't know where it is.
01:33:58.758,01:34:01.136,"-We'll see about that, won't we?"
01:34:01.177,01:34:02.596,Let's go. Get in here.
01:34:03.637,01:34:06.141,Come on! Come on!
01:34:07.434,01:34:10.437,Come on!
01:34:43.970,01:34:45.430,"That didn't hurt so bad, did it?"
01:34:47.307,01:34:48.141,Asshole.
01:34:58.109,01:34:59.110,Let's go back a few minutes.
01:35:06.451,01:35:08.702,Drucker's syncording.
01:35:08.744,01:35:10.121,There he is.
01:35:10.163,01:35:12.123,Keep this and wait here for me.
01:35:12.165,01:35:16.002,"If I'm not back in an hour, you know what to do."
01:35:16.044,01:35:21.799,"Don't worry. Anything happens to you or my family, I'm gonna destroy that son of a bitch."
01:35:29.599,01:35:31.685,You got the location?
01:35:31.725,01:35:35.104,The airport. I was just there.
01:35:35.146,01:35:35.980,Let's go.
01:35:37.023,01:35:38.608,Betrayed by your own mind.
01:35:50.370,01:35:52.163,"Wait, wait!"
01:35:53.248,01:35:54.541,What?
01:35:54.583,01:35:56.376,They staged that scene for our benefit.
01:35:56.418,01:35:59.421,The other one was sitting behind him so we couldn't see him. Look.
01:35:59.462,01:36:02.173,The bastard faked his own syncording.
01:36:02.215,01:36:07.345,The other one was hiding in the Whispercraft and this one deliberately avoided looking at him so he wouldn't be in his visual memory.
01:36:07.387,01:36:09.472,"You mean the other one's in this building, too?"
01:36:09.514,01:36:10.764,"Yes, Marshall, that's correct."
01:36:10.806,01:36:13.017,"Now, warn Vincent."
01:36:13.059,01:36:14.060,This one is the diversion.
01:36:20.316,01:36:23.528,He smashes all the cameras 'cause he gets himself captured.
01:36:23.570,01:36:26.615,"Meanwhile, the other one's free to just stroll in here and take his wife and kid."
01:37:07.196,01:37:08.531,-Oh.
01:37:14.078,01:37:15.121,"Natalie, Clara!"
01:37:15.163,01:37:16.331,-Daddy!
01:37:16.372,01:37:17.499,"Oh, my God!"
01:37:17.540,01:37:18.832,-It's me.
01:37:28.050,01:37:31.721,"-Don't worry, sir. Get him up."
01:37:31.763,01:37:34.599,"-I'm scared, Dad. I'm scared."
01:37:34.641,01:37:37.059,"-This isn't because of the cigar, is it?"
01:37:34.641,01:37:38.687,"-No, that has nothing to do-- -I'll explain everything later."
01:37:46.611,01:37:49.531,Don't worry.
01:37:51.825,01:37:55.286,"Wait! Talia, you go."
01:37:57.871,01:37:59.457,Have 'em block all the exits.
01:38:01.000,01:38:03.753,"Yeah, Henderson, come in."
01:38:01.000,01:38:05.171,"Seal off the entire tank areas, levels six and seven."
01:38:10.926,01:38:12.804,"I'm trying, sir."
01:38:12.846,01:38:14.888,And get us some power up here.
01:38:16.182,01:38:17.308,Don't move!
01:38:17.350,01:38:20.061,My daughter is right inside that door.
01:38:20.102,01:38:23.314,"Now, I don't want to expose her to any graphic violence."
01:38:23.356,01:38:26.025,She already gets enough of that from the media.
01:38:26.067,01:38:29.445,Put your weapons down.
01:38:29.487,01:38:36.494,"Good. Now, when you go inside, you say-- -Have a nice flight."
01:38:36.536,01:38:38.454,Friends of Daddy's.
01:38:38.496,01:38:40.331,"All right, let's go."
01:38:49.006,01:38:52.218,Have a little midnight flight with Daddy and Mommy.
01:38:52.968,01:38:55.346,There we are. All right?
01:38:56.347,01:38:57.807,Sorry.
01:38:57.849,01:38:58.932,"There you go, sir."
01:39:00.309,01:39:02.478,Wiley. Go.
01:39:03.479,01:39:04.355,All right.
01:39:05.939,01:39:07.609,"Wiley, just wait one second."
01:39:17.660,01:39:18.703,Not again!
01:39:23.249,01:39:24.751,And don't bring him back.
01:39:24.793,01:39:28.504,Stupid bastard blew a hole through my stomach.
01:39:28.546,01:39:32.300,"Oh, God! I'll be dead in 20 minutes tops."
01:39:35.553,01:39:37.054,"But what better place, right?"
01:39:38.431,01:39:41.392,Henderson? Where's my power?
01:39:41.434,01:39:43.227,"Relays are coming on-line now, sir."
01:39:43.269,01:39:45.897,Get all exits blocked.
01:39:50.359,01:39:51.193,Shit.
01:39:57.575,01:39:59.828,Go start warming up a blank.
01:39:59.869,01:40:02.455,I want a fresh syncording.
01:40:53.088,01:40:55.424,"Okay, here it is."
01:40:55.466,01:40:57.134,This will be a complete syncording.
01:41:13.860,01:41:14.819,Go help her.
01:42:18.382,01:42:21.427,-What have you got?
01:42:21.469,01:42:23.178,"Okay, go. Take the back walk."
01:43:35.334,01:43:36.544,No.
01:43:47.930,01:43:48.931,"Oh, God!"
01:44:39.272,01:44:40.566,"Oh, no."
01:45:00.878,01:45:02.379,-Take her to your mother's.
01:45:02.421,01:45:04.590,"And stay there until I pick you up, okay?"
01:45:04.632,01:45:06.050,"Come with us, Daddy."
01:45:06.092,01:45:08.928,"I have to help a friend, okay? Bye."
01:45:32.660,01:45:34.287,"-Wiley, you shot me!"
01:45:37.873,01:45:39.416,"Oh, right. That was you."
01:45:42.753,01:45:43.921,I gotta get dressed.
01:45:47.633,01:45:51.262,You're not even gonna wait until... I die?
01:45:52.263,01:45:53.306,Would you?
01:45:54.723,01:45:57.310,"-Come on, get it off."
01:45:58.811,01:46:01.022,Blood on the jacket.
01:46:18.831,01:46:19.748,What?
01:46:25.629,01:46:26.881,What?
01:46:26.922,01:46:28.549,-What?
01:46:35.556,01:46:39.810,"Look. Adam, we can make a deal."
01:46:39.852,01:46:42.104,You have absolutely no reason to kill me.
01:46:39.852,01:46:43.396,"I didn't do anything to you, it was all him."
01:46:44.439,01:46:46.317,Listen to me.
01:46:46.359,01:46:49.195,I can rebuild all of this in a very short time.
01:46:49.237,01:46:50.946,"I can still save you, Adam."
01:46:50.988,01:46:52.114,Save me?
01:46:52.156,01:46:56.369,We put congenital defects into the clone DNA to give the clones short life spans.
01:46:56.409,01:46:59.955,You want to know what you're gonna die of?
01:46:59.997,01:47:02.333,"We can go right upstairs, right now and look it up."
01:47:39.161,01:47:40.746,We all have to die someday.
01:47:40.788,01:47:41.956,We don't have to die.
01:47:43.582,01:47:45.876,I'm offering you the chance to live forever.
01:47:47.128,01:47:50.131,Never aging.
01:47:50.839,01:47:52.967,Perfect? Like you?
01:47:54.051,01:47:57.012,Look! Here is your perfection!
01:47:58.513,01:48:02.475,No. No. No.
01:48:05.396,01:48:08.481,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
01:48:11.484,01:48:14.655,There's no need to panic.
01:48:14.696,01:48:17.699,"No, you won't fix anything."
01:48:18.367,01:48:19.410,It's finished!
01:48:38.429,01:48:42.683,"When I said you should screw yourself, I didn't mean for you to take it literally."
01:49:13.839,01:49:18.052,Go after him. Just get him.
01:49:21.472,01:49:23.349,Check the roof.
01:49:45.829,01:49:47.580,He's goin' up!
01:50:39.467,01:50:40.301,Come on!
01:51:04.657,01:51:05.867,Can you fly this?
01:51:05.909,01:51:07.035,Better than you can.
01:51:07.077,01:51:09.121,Good. Because your shooting sucks.
01:51:18.213,01:51:19.256,Let's get out of here.
01:52:23.778,01:52:24.613,Shit.
01:52:34.747,01:52:36.833,Come on! Come on!
01:52:57.438,01:52:59.147,Try to climb over me!
01:53:08.115,01:53:09.450,Come on! Hurry up!
01:53:13.537,01:53:14.371,Shit.
01:53:21.754,01:53:22.588,Come on!
01:53:44.276,01:53:45.110,Shit!
01:54:12.304,01:54:14.598,"You know, I keep wondering."
01:54:14.640,01:54:18.769,Am I really human?
01:54:18.811,01:54:20.937,"Well, your DNA scan came back normal."
01:54:20.979,01:54:23.565,-Didn't it?
01:54:23.607,01:54:27.068,Zero defects.
01:54:27.110,01:54:30.030,"Well, if you're not human, don't you think they would've mentioned it?"
01:54:33.992,01:54:36.578,"All right, enough philosophy."
01:54:36.620,01:54:40.374,I better get going.
01:54:40.415,01:54:42.710,You have to hurry if you want to see Clara.
01:54:42.751,01:54:46.171,"Oh, thanks for letting me say goodbye to your family."
01:54:46.213,01:54:49.675,"Now, wait."
01:54:50.884,01:54:54.304,You were willing to die to save them.
01:54:54.346,01:54:59.100,"Now you might think about that while you're out there at sea, wondering if you're really human or not."
01:54:59.142,01:55:02.604,"Because if that's not being human, I don't know what is."
01:55:05.023,01:55:06.066,Thanks.
01:55:13.198,01:55:14.616,"Hello, everybody."
01:55:15.743,01:55:18.078,-Look what I brought.
01:55:23.458,01:55:27.796,"I thought that, um, Hank's cat was-- She is."
01:55:27.838,01:55:30.006,But you hate RePets.
01:55:30.048,01:55:32.634,"Well, I changed my mind."
01:55:32.676,01:55:34.010,You old softie.
01:55:35.512,01:55:36.971,Can we keep her?
01:55:37.013,01:55:38.515,-Please? Please?
01:55:38.557,01:55:41.518,That's why I brought her home.
01:55:41.560,01:55:42.811,Good.
01:55:42.853,01:55:44.730,-Oh.
