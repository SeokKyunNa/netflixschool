00:02:41.828,00:02:42.788,"Right, then."
00:02:45.248,00:02:47.000,I know how this bit goes.
00:02:52.923,00:03:04.393,My name is Elton Hercules John… and I'm an alcoholic.
00:03:08.563,00:03:09.940,And a cocaine addict.
00:03:13.527,00:03:14.861,And a sex addict.
00:03:17.781,00:03:18.949,And a bulimic.
00:03:21.535,00:03:32.170,"I'm also a shopaholic, who has problems with weed… prescription drugs… and anger management."
00:03:33.588,00:03:34.673,Why are you here now?
00:03:34.798,00:03:36.258,"Well, my dealer was out of town."
00:03:36.341,00:03:38.343,I thought this seemed like a good alternative.
00:03:46.852,00:03:48.854,I'm here because I want to get better.
00:03:49.020,00:03:50.981,"What were you like as a child, Elton?"
00:03:51.148,00:03:52.232,As a child?
00:05:40.090,00:05:41.132,You're late!
00:05:41.675,00:05:44.052,I've had to throw your dinner in the bin! Get inside.
00:05:55.063,00:05:55.939,Is he back?
00:05:57.482,00:05:58.608,What am I? Thin air?
00:05:59.609,00:06:00.735,Wouldn't get your hopes up.
00:06:00.902,00:06:03.154,He's very unreliable and very selfish.
00:06:03.321,00:06:05.365,But will you send him up if I'm already in bed?
00:06:05.532,00:06:06.908,Reggie! Move!
00:06:07.242,00:06:09.160,Got to get this done before I go out.
00:06:12.873,00:06:13.915,"All right, all done."
00:06:18.295,00:06:19.379,Where's my cardigan?
00:06:42.736,00:06:43.862,What?
00:06:44.195,00:06:45.405,Did I do something wrong?
00:06:45.864,00:06:47.032,"Bloody hell, Sheila."
00:06:47.198,00:06:48.867,Maybe we should get him some lessons.
00:06:49.618,00:06:50.493,Love to.
00:06:50.827,00:06:52.454,Get him out from under my feet.
00:06:56.166,00:06:57.459,"Go on, play it again."
00:07:08.136,00:07:10.096,Managed to drag yourself home then.
00:07:10.180,00:07:12.349,"-Hello, Stanley. -How are you, Ivy?"
00:07:13.934,00:07:15.477,Come on. You're letting in a draft.
00:07:19.981,00:07:21.107,How long you back?
00:07:21.399,00:07:23.068,I've got a couple of weeks' leave.
00:07:23.276,00:07:25.070,Reggie's not long gone to bed.
00:07:25.403,00:07:27.864,"Go on. Pop up, say hello."
00:07:28.990,00:07:30.075,I'll see him tomorrow.
00:07:32.243,00:07:33.328,Any dinner left?
00:07:33.745,00:07:35.789,Or have you fed it all to that boy?
00:07:38.208,00:07:42.837,My dad was passionate about… family and music.
00:07:44.464,00:07:46.007,He'd talk for hours about jazz.
00:07:47.008,00:07:48.218,He was always hugging me.
00:07:48.426,00:07:49.469,I was very lucky.
00:07:54.808,00:07:56.559,I was actually a very happy child.
00:08:05.318,00:08:07.779,"Dad, is it true you play piano?"
00:08:07.946,00:08:09.447,I'm saving to get lessons.
00:08:09.781,00:08:12.033,"If you want to sit in here, you'll have to be quiet."
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.380,"I like this one, Dad."
00:08:31.302,00:08:34.639,"Never, ever touch my collection without asking."
00:08:45.442,00:08:47.027,When are you going to hug me?
00:08:48.028,00:08:48.987,Don't be soft.
00:08:57.787,00:08:59.205,What are you still doing up?
00:08:59.372,00:09:00.248,Learning.
00:09:01.791,00:09:03.376,Turn off the light. Go to sleep.
00:10:06.815,00:10:07.982,Play another one.
00:10:09.109,00:10:10.777,"The Moonlight Sonata, Reggie."
00:10:13.780,00:10:18.409,Mum? My piano teacher thinks I'm good enough for a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music.
00:10:19.953,00:10:22.163,The Royal Academy of Music?
00:10:25.667,00:10:26.668,Royal.
00:10:26.751,00:10:27.794,Scissors.
00:10:30.839,00:10:31.965,What do you think?
00:10:32.423,00:10:33.716,The red one's good.
00:10:35.260,00:10:36.427,It's only on Saturdays.
00:10:37.178,00:10:38.471,I've things to do on weekends.
00:10:38.638,00:10:40.515,-Can't just drop everything. -I'll take you.
00:10:43.434,00:10:44.686,Where are you off to?
00:10:45.145,00:10:46.187,Don't know.
00:10:46.479,00:10:47.814,Haven't decided yet.
00:10:48.314,00:10:51.484,"But whatever it is, you're not invited."
00:10:51.651,00:10:54.445,Reggie's piano teacher thinks he's good enough for a scholarship.
00:10:55.071,00:10:56.114,Really?
00:10:56.739,00:10:58.283,You think he's got that kind of talent?
00:11:00.994,00:11:03.997,if you took the slightest bit of interest in me or this family.
00:11:14.465,00:11:16.176,Stop looking at that. You're not a girl.
00:11:30.231,00:11:31.357,Can we go home?
00:11:31.441,00:11:33.443,Home? No going home.
00:11:33.693,00:11:34.861,This is your life.
00:11:35.528,00:11:37.822,You have to get over that silly shyness.
00:11:38.156,00:11:41.326,But Mum says I'll never… Everybody's frightened at the beginning.
00:11:41.492,00:11:43.661,You play at being confident.
00:11:44.954,00:11:48.041,"Life gives you very few chances, Reggie, and this is one of yours."
00:11:48.458,00:11:50.335,You show 'em you can be as good as they are.
00:11:50.460,00:11:52.587,"Better. Number one. You can do that, can't you?"
00:11:53.546,00:11:56.049,"-Yeah, I suppose. -Good. Go on then. Here."
00:11:56.674,00:11:59.093,Here's for a bag of chips and your bus fare home.
00:12:16.653,00:12:17.946,Reginald Dwight?
00:12:23.368,00:12:24.744,"Good, thank you."
00:12:29.707,00:12:31.417,Did you not bring something to play?
00:12:33.419,00:12:34.629,Didn't know I had to.
00:12:36.089,00:12:43.721,"I see. Well… So, can you show me anything, so I can get a sense of where you're up to?"
00:13:05.201,00:13:06.411,Why have you stopped?
00:13:09.038,00:13:10.123,That's as far as you got.
00:13:13.835,00:13:17.922,"You might have a good memory, and a good ear, but you've an awful lot of work to do."
00:13:18.965,00:13:21.342,"So, wrists and back straight."
00:13:22.218,00:13:26.264,"Let's start with the C-major scale, both hands, two octaves."
00:13:40.194,00:13:41.529,What you looking at me for?
00:16:10.803,00:16:12.346,Boy-- There's a boy there.
00:16:14.765,00:16:16.476,Reggie. What you doing?
00:16:19.228,00:16:21.814,I'm Fred. I'm a friend of your mum's.
00:16:33.534,00:16:39.207,and now I've finally got a reason to leave and be rid of you and this bloody house!
00:17:02.688,00:17:04.398,He didn't even give me a hug goodbye.
00:17:06.567,00:17:08.319,He's no good at showing affection.
00:17:09.028,00:17:10.071,Never has been.
00:17:13.574,00:17:16.160,"-I wish I was someone else. -Oh, don't be silly."
00:17:22.041,00:17:23.668,"Well, how do you think I felt?"
00:17:26.796,00:17:27.672,I was a kid.
00:17:33.302,00:17:34.303,Heartbroken.
00:17:37.932,00:17:39.559,"People don't care though, do they?"
00:17:43.854,00:17:49.277,Anyway… I'd discovered records.
00:17:51.529,00:17:52.738,And rock 'n' roll.
00:18:05.668,00:18:06.752,"Thanks, Mum."
00:18:06.961,00:18:08.004,It's fantastic.
00:18:08.671,00:18:10.965,You serious about wanting to be a rock 'n' roller?
00:18:11.340,00:18:12.967,Yeah. Of course.
00:18:13.384,00:18:15.094,"Better get you the proper haircut, eh?"
00:18:15.928,00:18:17.096,Can I get it cut like Elvis?
00:18:17.179,00:18:19.056,Enjoy it while it lasts.
00:18:19.473,00:18:20.766,He's like my side of the family.
00:18:20.975,00:18:23.311,He'll be bald as an egg by the time he's 20.
00:18:45.708,00:18:48.294,half a pound of prime mince and a string of sausages.
00:18:51.714,00:18:55.384,"Now, Sheila and Fred's boy is gonna sing us a couple of songs on the piano."
00:18:55.551,00:18:57.011,Reggie Dwight!
00:19:03.809,00:19:05.853,Bloody hell. Have you got a fag?
00:19:10.650,00:19:11.692,Rubbish!
00:19:12.193,00:19:14.654,"Reg, Reg, play the one I like."
00:19:16.238,00:19:17.281,Excuse me.
00:19:17.823,00:19:19.617,-You can't put that there. -Why not?
00:19:19.784,00:19:20.951,It'll get knocked off.
00:20:22.513,00:20:23.556,Hey!
00:21:46.722,00:21:47.765,Fight!
00:22:41.151,00:22:43.028,They won't bite. Have a word.
00:22:47.241,00:22:49.201,You look like you know how to enjoy yourselves.
00:22:49.285,00:22:50.911,How'd you like to make two quid a week?
00:22:51.662,00:22:52.705,Each.
00:22:54.582,00:22:55.499,Go on.
00:22:55.666,00:22:57.126,I'm a soul promoter.
00:22:57.293,00:23:01.589,"And I've got two new American acts doing a tour of England, and they all need backup."
00:23:03.549,00:23:05.384,"I'll need to know by tomorrow, lunchtime."
00:23:55.517,00:24:04.693,"So how does a fat boy from Pinner… with glasses, called Reggie Dwight… get to be a soul man, then, eh?"
00:24:07.905,00:24:08.906,Write some songs.
00:24:19.667,00:24:25.881,I'm a skinny black kid… from Detroit… whose real name is Rodney Jones.
00:24:26.548,00:24:33.138,And I played roadside joints for ten years… before I realized what I had to do.
00:24:33.305,00:24:34.556,"What, change your name?"
00:24:36.850,00:24:38.185,It's not just your name.
00:24:38.394,00:24:42.606,You gotta kill the person you were born to be in order to become the person you wanna be.
00:25:01.583,00:25:02.501,Have a good show.
00:25:12.136,00:25:13.262,"Watch that, mate."
00:25:15.681,00:25:17.182,-Elton? -Yeah?
00:25:18.600,00:25:20.102,I'm thinking of changing my name.
00:25:21.937,00:25:23.647,I'm thinking of changing it to Elton Dean.
00:25:24.648,00:25:25.774,But that's my name.
00:25:25.941,00:25:27.026,"Yeah, I know."
00:25:27.151,00:25:28.277,What do you think?
00:25:28.944,00:25:30.654,"I think, fuck off!"
00:25:31.697,00:25:32.698,Right.
00:25:48.839,00:25:50.549,"Piano players I've got. Ten a penny, mate."
00:25:50.841,00:25:52.176,"I sing, too."
00:25:52.760,00:25:53.719,What sort of stuff?
00:25:54.887,00:25:55.929,"Well, anything."
00:25:56.263,00:25:59.099,"Rock, soul, country and western."
00:25:59.266,00:26:02.519,"Bloody hell, I'm gonna shoot the next piano player who sings Streets of Laredo."
00:26:06.065,00:26:07.941,"Uh, well, I write stuff, too."
00:26:26.251,00:26:28.378,"That was good. I mean, it could do with some words."
00:26:29.338,00:26:31.965,Yeah. That's the part I struggle with.
00:26:34.510,00:26:35.886,"Oh, no, I just made that up."
00:26:37.805,00:26:38.806,Just now?
00:26:42.434,00:26:44.144,What did you say your name was again?
00:26:45.771,00:26:46.814,Elton.
00:26:48.607,00:26:50.234,-Elton? -Mmm.
00:26:51.610,00:26:52.736,Elton what?
00:27:02.121,00:27:03.163,John.
00:27:04.081,00:27:05.040,Elton John.
00:27:07.751,00:27:09.002,What are you doing in my office?
00:27:10.170,00:27:11.463,Just taking a meeting.
00:27:15.134,00:27:19.054,"I'll make you a cup of tea then, shall I… boss?"
00:27:29.064,00:27:30.274,Thank you so much for coming in.
00:27:30.357,00:27:32.317,"-Leave your details on your way-- -Please, Mr. Williams."
00:27:32.985,00:27:34.027,Give me a chance.
00:27:37.197,00:27:39.867,See if there's anything interesting in this one and set it to music.
00:27:49.126,00:27:50.460,"Okay. Well, I'll see you soon."
00:27:50.586,00:27:54.381,"-Thank you for coming in. -Will I hear from you, or-- We'll be in touch. We'll be in touch. Thank you."
00:27:54.673,00:27:57.134,Okay. Thanks so much for your time.
00:27:58.135,00:27:59.803,No worries. Come on.
00:28:16.195,00:28:18.071,-Thanks. -We close in an hour.
00:28:21.366,00:28:23.619,-Bernie Taupin? -Yeah. You must be Elton?
00:28:23.827,00:28:24.745,-Yeah. -Hi.
00:28:24.912,00:28:26.455,"Well, that's my stage name."
00:28:27.289,00:28:30.209,You can tell me your real name when we get to know each other better.
00:28:30.626,00:28:31.668,Right.
00:28:33.337,00:28:40.052,"-Uh… -Um… No, no, please. After you."
00:28:42.054,00:28:44.097,-I like your lyrics. -Thank you.
00:28:44.806,00:28:47.309,"Yeah, I got the tape you sent. It's great."
00:28:48.060,00:28:49.102,Really good.
00:28:49.478,00:28:50.437,Thanks.
00:28:51.521,00:28:54.858,Hang on. Don't bother with that one. That wasn't supposed to be in there.
00:28:55.108,00:28:57.194,"-That's sent by mistake. -No, no, that's really good."
00:28:57.819,00:28:59.029,I wrote a tune to it.
00:29:00.572,00:29:02.199,"-Yeah, I… -Border Song?"
00:29:02.407,00:29:05.702,Yeah. I read it and I could hear the whole tune in my head.
00:29:05.786,00:29:08.664,"It was all there, I could see all the notes, and I just had to get it out."
00:29:09.206,00:29:11.708,It was like my fingers couldn't work fast enough to keep up with my brain.
00:29:14.544,00:29:15.879,Do you ever get anything like that?
00:29:16.088,00:29:18.465,"Uh… not really, no."
00:29:19.132,00:29:20.884,"But I can write more for you, though, Elton."
00:29:21.677,00:29:23.136,I'll just send them down to you.
00:29:23.345,00:29:24.972,Great. That'll be good.
00:29:25.973,00:29:26.932,Great.
00:29:31.270,00:29:32.562,My real name's Reg Dwight.
00:29:33.105,00:29:34.147,Cool.
00:29:34.314,00:29:35.691,"Yeah, that sounds like a cowboy name."
00:29:37.025,00:29:40.862,"Yeah, all I ever… All I ever wanted to be was a cowboy, you see."
00:29:41.113,00:29:42.739,Do you like country and western music?
00:29:43.448,00:29:45.033,"-Yeah. -It's good, isn't it?"
00:29:45.450,00:29:47.327,Have you heard Streets of Laredo by Marty Robbins?
00:29:49.871,00:29:50.831,That's good.
00:30:09.558,00:30:11.059,-It's a good song. -It is good.
00:30:29.077,00:30:30.162,-Good. -Yeah.
00:30:30.620,00:30:32.122,"-Good song. -Yeah, good song."
00:30:32.289,00:30:33.665,"Well, anyway, all of these are great."
00:31:55.038,00:31:56.164,Am I supposed to be impressed?
00:31:56.331,00:31:57.249,"It's catchy, Dick."
00:31:57.374,00:31:59.459,These guys are special. I've got an instinct for these things.
00:31:59.626,00:32:02.170,"All right, don't break your neck sucking your own cock."
00:32:03.547,00:32:05.882,Maybe we could put these two into a little beat combo.
00:32:06.258,00:32:07.300,He's the good-looking one.
00:32:08.009,00:32:09.261,We'll make him the singer.
00:32:09.428,00:32:12.806,"Oh, no, hold on. I'm tone-deaf. Elton is… He sings the songs."
00:32:12.973,00:32:15.225,"Yeah, I could just take those songs and leave, if you like."
00:32:15.434,00:32:18.562,"Whoa, all right, no offense. Don't get your knickers in a twist."
00:32:18.728,00:32:20.939,"They are writing a lot of great tunes, Dick."
00:32:21.064,00:32:22.607,There is one that's perfect for Lulu.
00:32:22.774,00:32:23.900,"Easy, tiger."
00:32:24.985,00:32:26.903,You… You flatmates?
00:32:29.823,00:32:33.368,"So, I do the writing, I send it down to him, and then he adds the music."
00:32:33.827,00:32:35.787,Who ever heard of songwriters not living together?
00:32:36.079,00:32:38.498,"Yes, Lennon and McCartney are inseparable."
00:32:41.168,00:32:42.169,Play another one.
00:32:44.546,00:32:45.672,All right.
00:32:52.804,00:32:54.431,Depressing. Another one.
00:33:03.023,00:33:04.566,What the fuck's that about?
00:33:16.536,00:33:17.746,"What, are you taking the piss?"
00:33:20.248,00:33:22.417,Sounds like 99% of 'em are shit!
00:33:22.626,00:33:24.503,It's the one percent I'm interested in.
00:33:26.796,00:33:28.298,Ray says you're an investment.
00:33:29.257,00:33:30.592,But Ray knows fuck all.
00:33:31.510,00:33:33.637,You're a couple of pricks as far as I can tell.
00:33:34.137,00:33:42.145,"So, quit that backing-band nonsense, find a place to work together, and write me tunes that gray-haired old tramps'll whistle in the street."
00:33:42.896,00:33:43.772,You never know.
00:33:44.231,00:33:46.733,"One day, you might have enough for an album."
00:33:47.400,00:33:50.195,"Do that, and I'll put you on ten quid a week."
00:34:12.551,00:34:15.637,-They're struggling rock stars. -Hello. I'm Bernie.
00:34:28.775,00:34:31.152,"So, what are your plans now… Elton?"
00:34:33.405,00:34:35.532,"Written a lot of songs, haven't we? Enough for an album."
00:34:39.578,00:34:41.955,"Arabella, our new landlady. Yep."
00:34:43.290,00:34:45.041,"So, what about rock 'n' roll?"
00:34:46.710,00:34:49.087,What about hot chicks and cocaine orgies?
00:34:49.588,00:34:51.047,What about fame and fortune?
00:34:51.464,00:34:53.383,What about the fact that you're a fag?
00:34:58.471,00:34:59.389,A what?
00:35:00.307,00:35:03.226,Your little friend is a homosexual.
00:35:05.353,00:35:06.855,"No, I've got a girlfriend."
00:35:13.945,00:35:14.988,Are you?
00:35:18.908,00:35:19.951,Don't know.
00:35:24.247,00:35:26.166,"Would it matter if I was, Bernie?"
00:35:29.502,00:35:30.545,"No, not to me."
00:35:34.799,00:35:36.343,"Might matter to Arabella, though."
00:35:38.219,00:35:40.722,"Yeah, mate, I'd agree on that. Have you met her?"
00:35:40.847,00:35:41.973,Fuck.
00:35:55.236,00:35:56.988,-Bernie… -Okay. Sorry.
00:36:00.533,00:36:01.910,"Shh! You, shh!"
00:36:02.077,00:36:03.703,"-You, shh! -Bins everywhere."
00:36:05.955,00:36:08.333,"-No, no, Bernie. -What?"
00:36:08.833,00:36:09.918,What is it now?
00:36:11.419,00:36:12.671,What am I gonna do?
00:36:14.047,00:36:15.674,You're going to tell her.
00:36:17.258,00:36:18.718,It'll break her heart.
00:36:19.803,00:36:21.096,Not sure she has one.
00:36:30.939,00:36:32.524,-Come on. -Yeah.

00:36:45.537,00:36:46.788,"Listen, the songs are great."
00:36:47.831,00:37:00.760,"And people keep asking. They're, like, Who's that singing on the demos? And I-- You are a shit-hot piano player, you have an amazing voice, and I'm telling you, there is something special that happens… when you sing our songs."
00:37:01.594,00:37:04.514,You heard what Dick said. He said my hands are like midget boxers.
00:37:04.597,00:37:05.890,Who cares what Dick thinks.
00:37:07.225,00:37:11.271,I just don't know if I'm… what they're looking for.
00:37:17.026,00:37:18.653,It's time for you to be out front.
00:37:26.578,00:37:27.704,"I love you, man."
00:37:30.123,00:37:33.918,"I do, but… not in that way."
00:37:53.354,00:37:55.023,We became inseparable after that.
00:37:56.441,00:37:57.859,The brother I never had.
00:37:58.985,00:38:04.574,"Do you know, in 20 years, we have never had a single argument. Not once."
00:38:04.991,00:38:07.827,"Anyway, I took his advice, told Arabella."
00:38:09.704,00:38:11.247,"She took it very well, actually."
00:38:15.919,00:38:16.961,She's killed my piano.
00:38:17.295,00:38:19.631,You treacherous beast!
00:38:20.590,00:38:23.468,Your music's as shitty as you are!
00:38:25.011,00:38:26.054,"Hi, Mum."
00:38:29.808,00:38:32.143,You'll have to pay rent. I'm not made of money.
00:38:42.987,00:38:45.031,"-Get dressed, Reggie! -Elton."
00:38:48.701,00:38:49.744,We're songwriting.
00:38:51.412,00:38:52.705,Looks like it's going well.
00:38:58.711,00:39:01.130,"It's nice and tidy, and that's how I want it to stay."
00:39:01.714,00:39:03.633,I'll not have a doss house around here.
00:39:03.716,00:39:07.303,I can't do everything. I can't cook and clean and wash.
00:39:08.179,00:39:10.390,Rely upon me to do everything. It's not fair.
00:39:10.598,00:39:11.641,There's egg on this.
00:39:15.770,00:39:18.648,"I'd better go take a shave, I think."
00:42:49.859,00:42:50.860,How was that?
00:42:53.654,00:42:56.199,I love it. Best thing I've heard since Let It Be.

00:42:58.367,00:43:00.119,Always knew you boys could do it.
00:43:00.828,00:43:03.247,First thing I'm gonna do is put you on a three-album deal.
00:43:03.706,00:43:04.707,Three?
00:43:06.542,00:43:08.753,And I got you a couple of nights at the Troubadour.
00:43:08.920,00:43:12.256,-Doug Weston's an old friend. -Hang on. The Troubadour?
00:43:12.507,00:43:15.593,"-It's this really cool folk club in LA. -Yeah, we know what it is, Ray."
00:43:15.718,00:43:19.388,"Hang on. Now, let's not be hasty, because the thing is, I haven't even got a backing band yet."
00:43:19.472,00:43:21.224,"No, I've sorted the backup band, don't worry."
00:43:21.557,00:43:24.811,"Dick, I don't wanna appear ungrateful, but you can't just spring the Troubadour on me."
00:43:24.936,00:43:27.271,"Look, it's time to do something bold, Elton."
00:43:27.563,00:43:32.110,"Granted, America's a bit of a gamble, and you fuck up and I'll kill ya."
00:43:33.194,00:43:35.571,"But Ray'll go, too. He'll keep an eye on you."
00:43:36.155,00:43:37.990,Buy yourself some new clothes.
00:43:38.324,00:43:39.700,Get something flashy.
00:43:40.785,00:43:42.120,Let 'em know who you are.
00:43:43.162,00:43:48.793,"Put on a great fucking show, and just don't kill yourself with drugs."
00:43:51.295,00:43:52.296,"Yeah, all right."
00:43:53.840,00:43:54.966,I'm gonna have a massage.
00:43:56.342,00:43:57.468,Mary?

00:45:11.751,00:45:13.753,Be totally packed. You're gonna love it.
00:45:14.378,00:45:16.130,It's a bit different from what I expected.
00:45:17.840,00:45:19.258,"Yeah, it's just a bit smaller."

00:57:56.223,00:57:58.433,Rock music has a new star.
00:57:58.517,00:58:08.026,"He's Englishman Elton John, a 23-year-old, whose debut at the Troubadour was, in every way, magnificent."
00:58:09.987,00:58:11.279,"It's happening, guys."
00:58:11.655,00:58:14.825,"Just remember, when you get back… four shows you owe me."
00:58:19.621,00:58:21.331,Did-- You said four shows?
00:58:23.625,00:58:29.423,So… will I see you when I get back?
00:58:29.548,00:58:32.759,"Now, don't worry about me. Go and enjoy your moment."
00:58:32.843,00:58:35.178,-That's what's important. -Come to London with me.
00:58:36.263,00:58:39.558,"I can't, but, uh… But next time I'm there, I'll look you up."
00:58:40.100,00:58:41.101,Promise.
00:58:41.476,00:58:43.603,"Hey, I've opened the fucking house."
00:58:43.770,00:58:44.730,Don't be a bummer.
00:58:45.647,00:58:46.857,I'm gonna watch out front.
00:59:05.292,00:59:06.710,Ah! I love 'em.
00:59:07.335,00:59:10.922,These are extremely stylish boots of my own design.
00:59:11.089,00:59:12.674,Can you even play the piano in those?
00:59:24.394,00:59:28.982,-It's never gonna last. -Well… Let's just enjoy it while we can.
01:00:17.072,01:00:17.989,John.
01:00:24.287,01:00:26.832,"Okay… Guys, we're gonna stop there."
01:00:27.040,01:00:28.750,"-You all right, darling? -Yeah, I'm fine."
01:00:29.084,01:00:30.877,"Kiki, would you mind giving me five minutes?"
01:00:43.473,01:00:44.474,Hello.
01:00:46.476,01:00:47.519,What are you doing here?
01:00:47.769,01:00:48.812,Business.
01:00:49.980,01:00:52.315,"And I promised if I was ever in town, I'd look you up."
01:00:53.066,01:00:54.317,How long you staying?
01:00:54.901,01:00:56.653,"Well, I'm not sure. That depends."
01:01:02.450,01:01:04.452,Makes it very hard to stop thinking about you.
01:01:07.122,01:01:07.998,Really?
01:01:11.710,01:01:13.670,Are we going again or shall we go for a pint?
01:01:19.134,01:01:21.136,"Yeah, no, yeah, you should go for a pint."
01:01:36.484,01:01:37.569,"What do you want, Elton?"
01:01:39.988,01:01:41.781,"You're so humble, it's embarrassing."
01:01:42.741,01:01:45.493,A millionaire rock star who lives at home with his mum.
01:01:47.579,01:01:48.747,Things are serious now.
01:01:49.247,01:01:51.416,Be brave. Think big.
01:01:52.876,01:01:54.252,What do you really want?
01:04:08.803,01:04:11.806,Elton feels things will run more smoothly if he has personal management.
01:04:13.391,01:04:15.852,-There's never been a problem before. -And there isn't one now.
01:04:17.187,01:04:20.231,"Look, there's loads of work and commitments, tours, etcetera."
01:04:20.398,01:04:22.359,"That's what I'll be doing, personal management."
01:04:22.484,01:04:24.444,-Taking care of things. -Is that right?
01:04:24.903,01:04:26.821,You realize I've got a contract with Elton.
01:04:27.072,01:04:30.617,"I've had that looked into, and my client is quite entitled to take on outside representation."
01:04:30.909,01:04:32.285,That's what you think.
01:04:34.287,01:04:36.915,You fucking poofter.
01:04:39.376,01:04:41.920,"And you. You're happy with this arrangement, are ya?"
01:04:42.462,01:04:43.505,Right?
01:04:43.880,01:04:45.131,After all these years?
01:04:45.632,01:04:47.175,"It's nothing personal, Dick."
01:04:50.887,01:04:52.055,"Come on, Ray."
01:04:57.018,01:04:58.395,"Best of luck to you, Elton."
01:05:03.525,01:05:06.736,Your very expensive painting is upside down.
01:05:09.697,01:05:10.824,"After you, Mr. James."
01:05:10.990,01:05:12.367,"Thank you, Raymond."
01:05:16.579,01:05:18.498,that was absolutely horrible.
01:05:19.290,01:05:22.252,"Don't worry, it's business. Dick's a big boy, he'll be fine."
01:05:22.335,01:05:26.047,"Mr. Reid, Lord Grade's office have called about the Royal Variety Performance."
01:05:26.214,01:05:28.299,"Apparently, the Queen Mother is a big fan."
01:05:28.550,01:05:31.469,Couldn't we have kept on Ray? He's such a lovely guy.
01:05:31.678,01:05:33.179,Lovely guy is not a job.
01:05:34.597,01:05:36.433,"This is a crucial time, Elton."
01:05:37.767,01:05:41.354,"You and I are gonna have to be more careful, 'cause the papers have been sniffing around."
01:05:41.563,01:05:43.898,We can't give them anything to speculate on.
01:05:44.315,01:05:46.484,I'm thinking of getting someone in as your girlfriend.
01:05:47.152,01:05:49.320,"-Doesn't that seem a bit excessive? -No, no, no, no, no."
01:05:49.863,01:05:51.948,This is your career and our business at stake.
01:05:52.073,01:05:56.619,If our sleeping arrangements get out… -all of this is gone. -Right.
01:05:57.287,01:05:59.122,And you're gonna have to talk to your parents.
01:05:59.747,01:06:01.124,Make sure they know what to say.
01:06:01.332,01:06:03.376,Those are the first doors reporters knock on.
01:06:22.395,01:06:24.814,"Well, come on in."
01:06:26.274,01:06:28.276,"Well, those are very fancy shoes."
01:06:28.776,01:06:30.320,Oh. Yeah.
01:06:32.197,01:06:33.448,I brought you something.
01:06:43.416,01:06:44.459,"Why are you here, Reg?"
01:06:52.550,01:06:54.552,"Dad, there's a Rolls-Royce outside."
01:06:54.802,01:06:59.724,"Stephen, Geoff… this is your brother, Reggie."
01:06:59.974,01:07:01.059,Half-brother.
01:07:01.768,01:07:03.353,Not actually called Reggie anymore.
01:07:04.896,01:07:05.980,Hmm.
01:07:06.648,01:07:10.193,"I thought maybe once I'm back from touring, you and I could get together, if you like."
01:07:10.693,01:07:13.530,I could get you some tickets to my next concert.
01:07:14.447,01:07:16.241,Not really my thing.
01:07:18.076,01:07:21.079,Is it true you're worth 25 million pound?
01:07:21.496,01:07:23.540,"Do you know, I don't actually know."
01:07:23.790,01:07:26.251,They're really proud of you. Mmm.
01:07:27.001,01:07:29.587,"Yeah, we've even got some of your records."
01:07:30.380,01:07:33.299,Why don't you go and get the album? Grab us a pen.
01:07:38.888,01:07:45.061,"You probably get asked this all the time, but would you… Would you mind signing this?"
01:07:49.107,01:07:50.149,"Yeah, of course."
01:07:56.239,01:07:58.992,"Oh, no. Would you make it out to Arthur?"
01:08:00.535,01:08:02.537,He's one of the blokes from work.
01:08:02.954,01:08:04.122,"Yeah, he's a big fan."
01:08:05.999,01:08:07.625,-Is he? -Mm-hmm.
01:08:16.009,01:08:17.010,Perfect.
01:08:19.929,01:08:20.930,Right.
01:08:22.765,01:08:25.685,"Well, looks like things worked out really well second time around, Dad."
01:08:26.603,01:08:27.979,-I suppose they have. -Mmm.
01:08:28.730,01:08:30.815,"'Cause, you know, not everybody gets a second chance."
01:08:39.824,01:08:41.451,"Sure. Thanks, Dad."
01:08:41.826,01:08:42.744,Bye.
01:08:48.166,01:08:50.752,What are you doing without your shoes on?
01:08:51.878,01:08:53.421,You're gonna be a draftsman.
01:08:55.173,01:08:56.341,Back inside.
01:09:24.202,01:09:26.788,"What have you got to do to get a fucking drink around here, eh?"
01:09:34.837,01:09:36.464,Will you stop sulking?
01:09:38.216,01:09:40.385,It has to be done whether you like it or not.
01:09:41.177,01:09:43.137,Are you gonna be scared of her your whole life?
01:09:44.847,01:09:46.015,"Right, stop the car."
01:09:46.224,01:09:48.226,"-Elton… -I said, stop the car!"
01:09:53.773,01:09:55.692,You're onstage in 15 minutes.
01:09:57.360,01:09:59.821,You're the big-shot manager. You make my excuses.
01:09:59.987,01:10:03.533,"Tell them I'm indisposed, breaking my mother's heart!"
01:10:04.492,01:10:06.035,Elton. Elton!
01:10:18.047,01:10:20.174,"Pinner nine, seven, double-five."
01:10:20.341,01:10:22.760,"-Mum, it's me. -I know who you are."
01:10:24.804,01:10:26.472,"Well, I've got something to tell you."
01:10:26.723,01:10:29.100,"Reggie, we're gonna miss the bit of the show with you on."
01:10:29.267,01:10:30.685,"Look, shut up, Mum!"
01:10:31.686,01:10:33.813,"I'm not on telly yet, am I? I'm talking to you."
01:10:35.690,01:10:49.120,"I… Me and John, we… Well, the thing is… I'm… a homosexual."
01:10:53.666,01:10:54.625,A poofter.
01:10:56.502,01:10:57.503,A fairy.
01:10:58.713,01:10:59.756,A queen.
01:11:05.344,01:11:06.387,"Well, say something."
01:11:10.641,01:11:12.560,"Oh, for God's sake, I know that."
01:11:15.062,01:11:16.189,Known for years.
01:11:18.858,01:11:21.152,"-You don't mind? -Frankly, I don't care."
01:11:22.278,01:11:24.947,But I'd rather you keep that sort of thing to yourself.
01:11:27.575,01:11:31.370,I just hope you realize you're choosing a life of being alone forever.
01:11:32.622,01:11:34.874,You'll never be loved properly.
01:11:40.880,01:11:42.423,Right. Got to go.
01:11:52.225,01:11:53.518,She said I'll never be loved.
01:11:55.311,01:11:56.938,Don't ever put me in this position again.
01:11:57.021,01:11:59.649,"You're onstage in ten minutes, so get over yourself and do the show."
01:11:59.816,01:12:01.901,"We're running a business here, you fucking idiot."
01:12:10.993,01:12:12.745,Real love's hard to come by.
01:12:20.419,01:12:22.421,"So, you find a way to cope without it."
01:13:24.150,01:13:25.610,-You okay? -Yeah.
01:13:26.444,01:13:28.404,Got the number-one album in America. Again.
01:13:28.613,01:13:32.575,I'm about to embark on the highest-grossing tour in rock history.
01:13:32.825,01:13:40.124,"I'm personally responsible for five percent of all record sales on the entire planet, and I have the biggest headdress known to man."
01:13:40.207,01:13:42.001,"So, yeah, I think I'm okay, Bernie."
01:13:42.084,01:13:43.502,It used to just be the two of us.
01:13:43.586,01:13:45.963,Now there's busloads of people just to do the music.
01:13:46.047,01:13:50.551,"Hang on, hang on, don't you wanna just go out there and sing without this ridiculous paraphernalia?"
01:13:51.177,01:13:54.013,"You know, just be yourself, Reg?"
01:13:55.640,01:13:58.142,"Why the fuck would I want that, Bernie?"
01:13:58.309,01:14:01.145,You wouldn't say this shit to me if you were a real friend.
01:14:01.312,01:14:03.731,People don't pay to see Reginald Dwight.
01:14:03.898,01:14:06.317,They pay to see Elton John!
01:14:06.525,01:14:09.487,Don't ever tell me how to do my fucking job!
01:14:16.410,01:14:17.286,Break a leg.
01:14:20.373,01:14:21.749,"You don't have to put up with this, Reg."
01:14:21.958,01:14:23.793,"Write the fucking lyrics, Bernie!"
01:14:24.877,01:14:26.337,Let me deal with the rest.
01:14:32.551,01:14:33.719,-I'm sorry. -I know.
01:14:36.347,01:14:40.267,Please welcome Elton John!
01:15:57.219,01:15:58.429,Where am I?
01:15:58.637,01:16:00.389,"At your house in LA, Mr. John."
01:16:02.349,01:16:03.392,Right.
01:16:04.685,01:16:05.936,I'll put some coffee on.
01:16:15.321,01:16:32.838,"Darling, I've been thinking, maybe we should quit the booze for a couple of days, take some quality time together… What are you doing, John?"
01:16:32.963,01:16:34.048,Just a bit of rock 'n' roll.
01:16:34.131,01:16:36.926,Rock 'n' roll is not shagging your secretary in front of the pool boys!
01:16:37.051,01:16:39.095,Rock 'n' roll is getting you out of your bed in the morning.
01:16:40.137,01:16:42.765,Arranging 250 gigs in 26 different countries.
01:16:43.015,01:16:51.107,"Rock 'n' roll's actually 112 employment contracts, insurance, copyright indemnity, renegotiating your previously insane contracts and wiping your arse."
01:16:51.232,01:16:52.942,"You know, all you do, Elton, is play the piano."
01:16:53.025,01:16:56.654,"But for me, rock 'n' roll is an 87 million-dollar-a-year industry."
01:16:56.737,01:16:59.031,"Maybe I just play the piano, but you know what else I do?"
01:16:59.657,01:17:01.408,"Hmm? I pay, John."
01:17:02.785,01:17:03.786,For everything.
01:17:04.411,01:17:06.831,"Including this house, which I'd like you to leave now."
01:17:07.248,01:17:10.251,"You may still be my manager, but you and me are finished."
01:17:10.417,01:17:12.378,"-You're so predictable. -No, not predictable."
01:17:12.461,01:17:20.469,"I want to be by myself, not with some asshole who doesn't give a shit about me and takes the piss day after day!"
01:17:23.180,01:17:24.640,Elton.
01:17:26.183,01:17:27.226,What are they doing here?
01:17:30.771,01:17:32.648,"No, no, next week, John."
01:17:32.773,01:17:33.732,It is next week.
01:17:33.983,01:17:35.359,I'm gonna go and fetch them a drink.
01:17:35.484,01:17:38.487,"Darling, why don't you clean yourself up, because you fucking stink."
01:17:38.696,01:17:40.239,Sheila!
01:17:40.656,01:17:41.991,It's been too long.
01:17:42.700,01:17:45.161,"-Beautiful woman. -Hello, look at this, you lovely lot."
01:17:45.244,01:17:46.579,"-Here we are. -Hi, Nan."
01:17:47.288,01:17:50.207,-I can't believe I'm actually in America. -I know.
01:17:50.332,01:17:52.334,"-Hi, Dad. -How you doing? Good to see you."
01:17:52.418,01:17:53.961,"-Elton. -Hello, Mum."
01:17:54.128,01:17:58.632,"Elton, darling, you remember the Andersons -from next door, don't you? -Yes, the Andersons."
01:17:58.799,01:18:00.301,How could we forget the Andersons?
01:18:00.801,01:18:01.802,-Hello. -Hello.
01:18:04.221,01:18:07.099,And what a shy little boy you were.
01:18:07.349,01:18:08.851,Look at you now.
01:18:08.976,01:18:11.061,"Elton, you must give them a tour."
01:18:11.145,01:18:12.563,"-Yes, right now, go on. -Yeah, okay."
01:18:12.730,01:18:14.356,"Everyone, Elton is giving a tour."
01:18:14.481,01:18:16.901,"-Mum, you're on my gown. -Don't be rude."
01:18:23.449,01:18:26.327,"Here we go. Come here, come here. Excited?"
01:18:27.494,01:18:28.537,-Car. -Yeah.
01:18:32.458,01:18:34.919,"-Bernie, how's it going, man? -Hey, man. How's it going?"
01:18:35.002,01:18:36.629,No idea who he is. Of course.
01:18:52.603,01:18:53.646,Here he is!
01:18:54.313,01:18:55.814,"Ladies, Elton."
01:18:56.148,01:18:57.191,-Hey. -Hey.
01:19:00.486,01:19:03.197,Miserable bastard. You're missing all the fun downstairs.
01:19:03.364,01:19:07.076,"Well, as long as all the fun isn't missing me, then who gives a shit, Bernie?"
01:19:10.704,01:19:11.830,We should get a drink.
01:19:12.831,01:19:15.584,"No, we should. Let's go get a drink. Come on, it's fine."
01:19:15.751,01:19:20.506,"No, we absolutely should. No, I'm telling you… Yeah, go and get a little drink."
01:19:55.499,01:19:57.793,Fucking prick.
01:20:10.222,01:20:16.186,"For my next trick, I'm gonna fucking kill myself."
01:22:22.479,01:22:23.981,You self-indulgent prick.
01:22:26.316,01:22:27.443,Baby!
01:24:52.588,01:24:54.881,I was saying that I think I need a break.
01:25:04.725,01:25:08.020,I'm going home… for a while.
01:25:08.979,01:25:10.105,"Well, that's nice for you."
01:25:11.106,01:25:14.651,"Why can't we just, you know, both of us just disappear together?"
01:25:18.196,01:25:19.281,My ranch.
01:25:19.531,01:25:21.408,"We'll go to my ranch, we'll hide away."
01:25:21.700,01:25:23.368,We can write like we did.
01:25:25.662,01:25:26.663,Like we used to.
01:25:27.914,01:25:30.292,"We should go home, Elton."
01:25:31.501,01:25:32.502,Reconnect.
01:25:37.716,01:25:38.759,"No, you should go."
01:25:40.427,01:25:42.763,There are other writers I'd like to work with anyway.
01:25:43.972,01:25:45.140,Do me good.
01:25:45.515,01:25:47.059,Collaborate with other people.
01:25:48.894,01:25:50.771,I think it's a really good idea.
01:26:14.169,01:26:16.546,My loyal subjects.
01:26:19.800,01:26:23.011,"Hello, hello, Australia. G'day."
01:26:26.973,01:26:29.101,Swindon. Or wherever the hell we are.
01:26:34.981,01:26:37.275,It's what everyone else seems to be doing at the moment.
01:26:39.653,01:26:43.448,"Anyway, here's one for all the sober people."
01:28:35.977,01:28:37.145,of being alone forever.
01:28:37.312,01:28:39.356,You'll never be loved properly.
01:28:39.523,01:28:40.982,When are you going to hug me?
01:28:46.112,01:28:47.823,and this is one of yours. Who are you?
01:28:49.866,01:28:52.536,You can be anyone you want. What do you really want?
01:28:55.038,01:28:56.581,Look at you now.
01:29:33.201,01:29:34.202,What do you want? I'm busy.
01:29:34.619,01:29:36.872,Why don't you get back in the studio you're paying for?
01:29:38.790,01:29:42.127,Why don't you sell my fucking records? What's this? Hmm?
01:29:42.711,01:29:44.421,Number 11 in Italy.
01:29:44.963,01:29:46.798,"The song doesn't work, that's the problem."
01:29:46.882,01:29:48.508,"The record's coked out, MOR, shit."
01:29:48.592,01:29:56.641,"No, the problem… is you have never understood me… and what I have to go through."
01:29:56.892,01:29:59.102,And you know what? I should've sacked you when you left me.
01:29:59.311,01:30:04.900,"I am glad I left you. It means I can maintain some objectivity in your self-indulgent, myopic little world."
01:30:05.066,01:30:06.985,Get in the studio and make some music or don't.
01:30:07.402,01:30:08.445,I don't care.
01:30:13.825,01:30:15.911,"Well, you will when your money runs out."
01:30:22.417,01:30:24.502,You signed contracts with me years ago.
01:30:25.003,01:30:28.548,"So, I'll still be collecting my 20% long after you've killed yourself."
01:30:29.841,01:30:31.801,Get out of my fucking house!
01:30:33.637,01:30:34.679,Fuck off!
01:30:43.855,01:30:45.315,It's fantastic.
01:30:47.692,01:30:49.736,"-Would you like to hear it again? -Not really, no."
01:30:52.822,01:30:54.282,Would you like a cup of tea?
01:30:55.742,01:30:56.785,Not got anything stronger?
01:31:00.246,01:31:01.498,You should be very proud.
01:31:03.500,01:31:11.800,"I've watched you play many times, and your music is always so… personal and honest… and open."
01:31:15.887,01:31:17.555,It must be lonely sometimes.
01:33:57.048,01:33:58.842,-Morning. -Morning.
01:34:48.600,01:34:49.642,I'm sorry.
01:34:54.772,01:34:55.815,I know.
01:35:02.113,01:35:03.573,Renate didn't deserve that.
01:35:06.951,01:35:07.994,She's a good person.
01:35:10.622,01:35:12.582,I dragged her into all my madness.
01:35:14.584,01:35:16.211,Did being married make you happy?
01:35:16.878,01:35:18.546,Not really. I'm gay.
01:35:26.638,01:35:29.057,"-Sir, would you like me to… -Maybe a bit later, thank you."
01:35:29.140,01:35:30.225,"-Hi, Dad. -Hello, son."
01:35:31.142,01:35:32.268,-You all right? -Yeah. Good.
01:35:32.393,01:35:34.771,Just talking about poor Renate.
01:35:36.022,01:35:37.440,Such a lovely woman.
01:35:37.815,01:35:39.776,Divorce can be so painful.
01:35:45.281,01:35:49.160,We found a lovely villa by the sea.
01:35:49.285,01:35:53.498,"It'd be good if you would talk to John today, get the money arranged. Can't risk losing this one."
01:35:53.790,01:35:54.832,"Yeah, in Minorca."
01:35:54.916,01:35:56.709,It is a lovely place. You should see it.
01:36:01.172,01:36:02.674,What do you want to go there for?
01:36:07.220,01:36:13.017,"there's something about you and the booze or the drugs, and… you're breaking your poor mum's heart."
01:36:13.226,01:36:14.769,"Tell you what, I'll write you a check. Hmm?"
01:36:14.936,01:36:16.145,So she can go buy a new one.
01:36:16.479,01:36:21.359,"Typical that you'd say something like that about me, when I've given up so much for you."
01:36:21.484,01:36:22.986,What have you given up for me?
01:36:23.069,01:36:26.114,Your father… for a start.
01:36:31.327,01:36:33.246,You really are a heartless monster.
01:36:38.084,01:36:40.003,"You know, I don't live my life in black and white."
01:36:42.338,01:36:45.466,"And I do not want your fucked-up, frigid ideas about anything."
01:36:51.973,01:36:53.391,of running away from who I am.
01:36:59.105,01:37:00.523,"In fact, why am I apologizing for it?"
01:37:00.606,01:37:02.817,"Mum, I have fucked everything that moves."
01:37:04.694,01:37:07.030,And I've taken every drug known to man.
01:37:07.155,01:37:08.114,All of them.
01:37:09.949,01:37:11.117,Do you know what?
01:37:13.077,01:37:14.537,I enjoyed every last minute of it.
01:37:15.288,01:37:20.126,"Ever since you first dangled your fat little legs in front of a piano, you've been lucky."
01:37:20.543,01:37:23.588,You've never worked hard for a bloody thing in your life.
01:37:23.755,01:37:26.090,It all just comes to you. You don't do anything.
01:37:26.215,01:37:28.092,And I'm the one who suffers.
01:37:28.259,01:37:30.553,I should never have had children.
01:37:30.803,01:37:34.599,Do you know how disappointing it is to be your mother?
01:38:46.087,01:38:47.255,"Some dessert, sir?"
01:38:48.548,01:38:54.178,"Yeah. Um, two chocolate puddings, an apple pie, and a raspberry fool, please."
01:38:54.345,01:38:58.057,"-Any ice cream? -I… -Yeah, all of them. -Excellent choice."
01:39:04.021,01:39:05.314,Where's Reid these days?
01:39:09.819,01:39:13.197,Uh… Does it matter?
01:39:13.990,01:39:15.324,Hates my fucking guts.
01:39:15.992,01:39:17.160,"Nobody hates you, Elton."
01:39:19.662,01:39:21.247,Campaign to kill yourself is going well.
01:39:22.457,01:39:23.791,"What are you doing here, Bernie?"
01:39:24.834,01:39:25.877,Hmm?
01:39:26.752,01:39:28.171,You left when it suited you.
01:39:28.713,01:39:30.339,Now you come back to lecture me?
01:39:32.175,01:39:35.928,"'Cause the thing is, the first time we actually got anywhere, you left, didn't you?"
01:39:36.220,01:39:40.975,Some girl was more important to you than me and all those legends who were welcoming us in.
01:39:43.144,01:39:45.855,"You left me at the most important time, Bernie."
01:39:46.814,01:39:47.940,When did you give up?
01:39:49.817,01:39:52.361,"If you don't care about yourself, how do you expect anyone else to?"
01:39:52.528,01:39:59.660,Whenever I needed you most… -you weren't there. -It's not weak to ask for help.
01:39:59.744,01:40:02.663,I have worked my balls off to get us out of the shit.
01:40:03.789,01:40:07.168,"Day in, day out, for years."
01:40:07.335,01:40:09.795,And now it's me that can't walk down the streets.
01:40:09.879,01:40:12.965,It's me who doesn't have a life.
01:40:14.091,01:40:18.888,"'Cause I don't get to sit around with my feet on a desk, chewing on the end of a fucking pencil."
01:40:18.971,01:40:21.098,"Write the lyrics, Bernie. I'll take care of everything else."
01:40:21.182,01:40:22.225,That was a test!
01:40:25.269,01:40:26.270,You should've known.
01:40:48.960,01:40:50.086,"I'm getting the bill, am I?"
01:40:52.213,01:40:53.214,Bernie!
01:41:01.764,01:41:03.683,"Yeah, yeah, later. Bernie!"
01:41:12.066,01:41:14.819,Don't be so dramatic. Coward!
01:41:15.570,01:41:18.990,Same as always! Leaving me when things get too real!
01:41:44.223,01:41:46.100,You fucking idiot!
01:42:04.577,01:42:06.871,Bernie betrayed me. The way everyone does.
01:42:27.475,01:42:30.186,"It's a chest infection, Mike. He'll be fine."
01:42:30.645,01:42:33.147,-How are ticket sales? -What the hell's that got to do with it?
01:42:33.314,01:42:34.482,Every night is sold out.
01:42:34.649,01:42:35.733,"Well, add five more nights then."
01:42:35.858,01:42:38.152,Are you insane? He could've died.
01:42:38.277,01:42:39.862,"Just let me take care of things, Mike."
01:42:39.945,01:42:41.572,"I always get him back on his feet, don't I?"
01:42:41.656,01:42:45.242,"Yeah, but are you gonna be able to… Brilliant, man. He is gonna be there."
01:43:26.492,01:43:27.660,"All right, you're good to go."
01:44:33.934,01:44:36.479,Hey! Where are you going?
01:45:58.060,01:45:59.395,Believed I'd never be loved.
01:46:03.858,01:46:07.361,"Yeah, but I started acting like a cunt in 1975."
01:46:10.114,01:46:11.448,I just forgot to stop.
01:46:17.246,01:46:18.497,I do feel ashamed.
01:46:21.375,01:46:24.587,Spent so long feeling resentful for things that just don't matter.
01:46:32.386,01:46:33.971,Maybe I should've tried to be more ordinary.
01:46:40.936,01:46:41.979,"Hello, Nan."
01:46:42.980,01:46:44.648,You was never ordinary.
01:46:48.319,01:46:51.322,"In here, talking about your feelings."
01:46:52.615,01:46:54.158,What a waste of time.
01:46:54.325,01:46:56.911,"Mum, I know it was never easy."
01:46:57.953,01:46:59.496,And I hope you can forgive me.
01:47:01.498,01:47:03.751,Because I've realized that's what we need to do now.
01:47:05.127,01:47:06.170,Forgive each other.
01:47:12.301,01:47:14.511,My problem was I believed you loved me.
01:47:14.803,01:47:16.221,And you're incapable of it.
01:47:16.639,01:47:19.767,I gave everything to keep something that I never even had in the first place.
01:47:21.393,01:47:24.146,I always thought you was an introverted extrovert.
01:47:24.897,01:47:26.023,A what?
01:47:26.190,01:47:28.192,He's shy. He's always been shy.
01:47:32.237,01:47:34.198,"He'd have been strange, regardless."
01:47:35.074,01:47:37.201,"Actually, I think I'm okay with strange."
01:47:37.868,01:47:38.911,God.
01:47:39.370,01:47:40.371,Not him.
01:47:40.579,01:47:42.873,Both of you. Stop.
01:47:43.457,01:47:46.418,I'm not going to allow you to talk to me like this anymore.
01:47:54.677,01:47:55.719,Bernie.
01:47:58.889,01:48:00.557,I never told you how much I need you.
01:48:00.683,01:48:02.351,"No, no, no, I love you, man."
01:48:05.270,01:48:06.397,"Always have, always will."
01:48:08.232,01:48:10.818,You write songs that millions of people love.
01:48:11.402,01:48:12.611,And that's what's important.
01:48:13.529,01:48:18.075,You just need to remember who you are… and be okay with it.
01:48:27.918,01:48:28.877,"Yes, I do."
01:48:31.714,01:48:33.132,I'm Elton Hercules John.
01:48:35.259,01:48:36.885,I thought you were Reggie Dwight.
01:48:48.022,01:48:49.690,I haven't been Reggie Dwight for years.
01:49:04.413,01:49:05.914,When are you going to hug me?
01:49:39.448,01:49:41.241,Impressed you know how to use one of those.
01:49:46.038,01:49:47.164,How you doing?
01:49:49.083,01:49:50.209,Good to see you.
01:49:50.959,01:49:53.212,"Some days are tougher than others, but I feel good."
01:49:55.047,01:49:56.423,They got a piano here?
01:49:57.424,01:50:00.636,-You been playing? -Hmm… -No. -No?
01:50:00.719,01:50:02.679,Not in the right place for that just now.
01:50:03.680,01:50:04.723,"I'm scared, Bernie."
01:50:09.144,01:50:14.650,What if I'm not as good… without the drink and the drugs?
01:50:18.487,01:50:19.738,You know that's not true.
01:50:22.074,01:50:25.119,"You're not scared you're not good without it, you're scared to feel again."
01:50:25.786,01:50:28.288,"You might be able to lie to yourself, but you can't lie to me."
01:50:37.172,01:50:38.215,Don't go.
01:50:39.967,01:50:40.968,Not yet.
01:50:42.261,01:50:43.762,This is the part you gotta do on your own.
01:50:45.681,01:50:47.933,These… need music.
01:50:58.485,01:50:59.444,"Thank you, Bernie."
01:51:04.158,01:51:05.242,You're my brother.
