00:00:56.056,00:00:58.475,"Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week."
00:00:59.726,00:01:01.019,I haven't.
00:01:01.102,00:01:03.813,Are you okay? Is everything all right?
00:01:08.777,00:01:09.986,"Oh, yeah."
00:01:11.029,00:01:12.822,Everything's great.
00:01:26.503,00:01:30.173,Marty! You've got to come back with me!
00:01:31.883,00:01:34.052,-Where? -Back to the future.
00:01:38.389,00:01:41.476,"-Wait a minute. What are you doing, Doc? -I need fuel."
00:01:43.686,00:01:46.147,Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.
00:01:47.524,00:01:49.734,"No, no, no, no. Look, Doc, I just got here, okay?"
00:01:49.818,00:01:52.195,Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.
00:01:52.278,00:01:55.365,"Well, bring her along. This concerns her, too."
00:01:55.448,00:01:57.242,"Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talking about?"
00:01:57.325,00:01:59.077,What happens to us in the future?
00:01:59.160,00:02:01.704,"What, do we become assholes or something?"
00:02:01.788,00:02:04.374,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You and Jennifer both turn out fine."
00:02:04.457,00:02:07.252,"It's your kids, Marty. Something's gotta be done about your kids."
00:02:14.634,00:02:18.054,"Hey, Doc, you'd better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88."
00:02:18.138,00:02:22.559,"Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads."
00:02:23.518,00:02:25.061,"Say, Marty!"
00:02:25.145,00:02:30.441,"Marty! Marty, I wanted to show you these new matchbooks for my auto detailing I had printed up."
00:02:34.320,00:02:35.738,A flying DeLorean?
00:02:48.626,00:02:50.253,What the hell is going on here?
00:04:25.723,00:04:27.934,-What the hell was that? -Taxicab.
00:04:28.726,00:04:30.728,"What do you mean, a taxicab? I thought we were flying."
00:04:30.812,00:04:31.813,Precisely.
00:04:32.188,00:04:36.025,"All right, Doc. What's going on, huh? Where are we? When are we?"
00:04:36.234,00:04:44.909,"We're descending toward Hill Valley, California, at 4:29 p.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, 2015."
00:04:44.993,00:04:46.619,2015?
00:04:48.079,00:04:49.998,"You mean, we're in the future?"
00:04:50.081,00:04:53.042,"The future? Marty, what do you mean? How can we be in the future?"
00:04:53.751,00:04:55.670,"Uh, Jennifer..."
00:04:57.130,00:05:02.343,"I don't know how to tell you this, but you're in a time machine."
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.976,"God, so, like, you weren't kidding."
00:05:10.059,00:05:12.687,"Marty, we can actually see our future."
00:05:12.770,00:05:14.897,"Doc, now, you said we were married, right?"
00:05:19.402,00:05:20.361,to see our wedding.
00:05:20.445,00:05:23.448,-Wow. -I'm gonna be able to see -my wedding dress. -Wow.
00:05:23.531,00:05:27.243,"God, I wonder where we live. I bet it's a big house with lots of kids."
00:05:28.536,00:05:31.331,"-Doc! What the hell are you doing? -Relax, Marty."
00:05:31.414,00:05:34.042,It's just a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator.
00:05:34.125,00:05:37.086,"She was asking too many questions, and no one should know too much about their future."
00:05:37.295,00:05:40.381,"This way, when she wakes up, she'll think it was all a dream."
00:05:40.465,00:05:43.259,-Then what did you bring her for? -I had to do something.
00:05:43.342,00:05:44.427,She saw the time machine.
00:05:44.510,00:05:46.846,I couldn't just leave her there with that information.
00:05:46.929,00:05:49.140,Don't worry. She's not essential to my plan.
00:05:50.266,00:05:51.851,"Well, you're the doc, Doc."
00:05:51.934,00:05:52.977,Here's our exit.
00:06:22.423,00:06:24.550,"First, you've gotta get out and change clothes."
00:06:24.634,00:06:26.636,Right now? It's pouring rain.
00:06:29.639,00:06:31.307,Wait five more seconds.
00:06:39.482,00:06:41.275,Right on the tick.
00:06:41.359,00:06:44.237,Amazing. Absolutely amazing.
00:06:44.821,00:06:48.074,Too bad the post office isn't as efficient as the weather service.
00:06:56.082,00:06:59.377,"Excuse the disguise, Marty, but I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me."
00:06:59.460,00:07:02.296,I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got an all-natural overhaul.
00:07:02.588,00:07:09.262,"They took out some wrinkles, did a hair repair, changed the blood, added a good 30 or 40 years to my life."
00:07:09.345,00:07:12.682,They also replaced my spleen and colon. What do you think?
00:07:14.350,00:07:15.643,"You look great, Doc."
00:07:19.188,00:07:20.690,The future.
00:07:21.691,00:07:23.109,Unbelievable.
00:07:23.860,00:07:26.529,"-I gotta check this out, Doc. -All in good time, Marty."
00:07:26.612,00:07:27.738,"We're on a tight schedule, here."
00:07:27.822,00:07:30.241,"Tell me about my future. I mean, I know I make it big."
00:07:30.324,00:07:32.160,"But what? Do I become, like, a rich rock star?"
00:07:32.243,00:07:34.412,"Please, Marty, no one should know too much about their own destiny."
00:07:34.495,00:07:35.872,Right. Right.
00:07:35.955,00:07:39.041,"-I am rich, though, right? -Marty, please, take off your shirt."
00:07:40.918,00:07:43.045,Put on the jacket and the shoes.
00:07:45.298,00:07:47.133,Got a mission to accomplish.
00:08:02.023,00:08:03.065,Aha.
00:08:03.149,00:08:04.525,Precisely on schedule.
00:08:10.072,00:08:11.657,Power laces. All right.
00:08:32.220,00:08:33.804,This thing doesn't fit.
00:08:35.932,00:08:37.308,Pull out your pants pockets.
00:08:37.391,00:08:40.186,All kids in the future wear their pants inside out.
00:08:40.269,00:08:41.687,Put on this cap.
00:08:41.771,00:08:44.482,Perfect. You're the spitting image of your future son.
00:08:44.565,00:08:46.609,-What? -Help me move Jennifer over here.
00:08:48.361,00:08:50.154,"-So, what's the deal? -Grab her feet."
00:08:50.238,00:08:53.574,"Oh. All right. Okay, now what?"
00:08:54.242,00:08:58.371,"In exactly two minutes, you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s."
00:09:00.206,00:09:02.833,"It's one of those nostalgia places, but not done very well."
00:09:02.917,00:09:05.545,Go in and order a Pepsi. Here's a 50.
00:09:05.628,00:09:07.547,Then wait for a guy named Griff.
00:09:07.630,00:09:09.382,-Right. Griff. -Right.
00:09:09.465,00:09:12.385,Griff's going to ask you about tonight. Are you in or out?
00:09:12.468,00:09:13.928,Tell him you are out.
00:09:14.011,00:09:16.472,"Whatever he says, whatever happens, say no, you're not interested."
00:09:17.473,00:09:20.059,"Then leave, come back here and wait for me."
00:09:21.227,00:09:28.568,"Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anything, don't do anything, don't interact with anyone and try not to look at anything."
00:09:28.651,00:09:31.362,I don't get it. I thought you said this had something to do with my kids.
00:09:31.445,00:09:33.573,Look what happens to your son.
00:09:35.074,00:09:36.367,My son?
00:09:37.910,00:09:40.162,"God, he looks just like me."
00:09:40.246,00:09:44.000,"Within two hours of his arrest, Martin McFly Jr."
00:09:44.083,00:09:48.087,"was tried, convicted and sentenced to 15 years in a state penitentiary."
00:09:48.170,00:09:49.547,Within two hours?
00:09:49.630,00:09:53.384,The justice system works swiftly in the future now that they've abolished all lawyers.
00:09:53.467,00:09:55.595,"-Oh, this is heavy. -Oh, it gets worse."
00:09:55.678,00:09:59.849,"Next week, your daughter attempts to break him out of jail, and she gets sent up for 20 years."
00:09:59.932,00:10:01.976,My daughter. Wait a minute. I have a daughter?
00:10:02.059,00:10:06.731,You see? This one event starts a chain reaction that completely destroys your entire family.
00:10:08.107,00:10:11.193,"Hey, Doc, this date... Wait. This is tomorrow's newspaper."
00:10:11.277,00:10:14.655,"Precisely, I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens."
00:10:14.739,00:10:16.240,I backtracked everything to this one event.
00:10:16.324,00:10:18.909,"That's why we're here today, to prevent this incident from ever happening."
00:10:20.328,00:10:22.163,Damn! I'm late!
00:10:22.246,00:10:25.041,-Wait a minute. Where you going now? -To intercept the real Marty Jr.
00:10:25.124,00:10:27.543,You're taking his place. Around the corner at the Cafe '80s.
00:10:27.627,00:10:29.712,Guy named Griff. Just say no!
00:10:30.338,00:10:32.923,"Hey, what... What about Jennifer? We're not just gonna leave her here."
00:10:33.007,00:10:35.968,"Don't worry, she'll be safe. It'll just be for a few minutes."
00:10:36.052,00:10:38.262,"And, Marty, be careful around that Griff character."
00:10:38.346,00:10:41.307,He's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants.
00:11:40.616,00:11:44.120,You can trust your car to the system with the star.
00:11:44.745,00:11:47.832,Checking oil. Checking landing gear.
00:12:03.472,00:12:04.765,The shark still looks fake.
00:12:07.268,00:12:08.978,for Wilson Hover Conversion Systems.
00:12:09.478,00:12:15.192,"You know, when my grandpa was mayor of Hill Valley, he had to worry about traffic problems."
00:12:15.276,00:12:17.987,"But now, you don't have to worry about traffic."
00:12:18.070,00:12:27.413,"I'll hover-convert your old road car into a skyway flier for only $39,999.95."
00:12:27.538,00:12:34.086,"So, come on down and see me, Goldie Wilson III, at any one of our 29 convenient locations."
00:12:34.170,00:12:36.255,"Remember, keep 'em flying."
00:12:53.898,00:12:57.776,Or you might want to go southwestern with our Alabama fajita tortilla pita.
00:12:58.819,00:13:06.952,"It's got a hot salsa, avocados, cilantro mixed with your choice of beans, chicken, beef or pork."
00:13:07.495,00:13:09.497,Waiter. Waiter.
00:13:12.958,00:13:18.339,"Welcome to the Cafe '80s, where it's always morning in America, even in the afternoon."

00:13:40.444,00:13:42.071,"Hey, McFly!"
00:13:43.239,00:13:45.533,Yeah. I've seen you around.
00:13:46.242,00:13:48.494,"You're Marty McFly's kid, aren't you?"
00:13:49.578,00:13:52.289,-Biff? -You're Marty Jr.
00:13:53.123,00:13:54.250,"Tough break, kid."
00:13:54.333,00:13:57.294,Must be rough being named after a complete butthead.
00:13:57.378,00:13:58.712,What's that supposed to mean?
00:13:58.796,00:14:01.799,-Hello? Hello? Anybody home? -Hey. Hey.
00:14:01.882,00:14:03.592,"Think, McFly, think!"
00:14:03.676,00:14:06.512,Your old man? Mr. Loser?
00:14:06.971,00:14:08.973,-What? -That's right.
00:14:09.598,00:14:11.934,Loser with a capital L.
00:14:12.685,00:14:15.062,"Look, I happen to know George McFly is no longer a loser."
00:14:15.145,00:14:18.524,"No, I'm not talking about George McFly. I'm talking about his kid."
00:14:18.691,00:14:27.199,"Your old man, Marty McFly Sr., the man who took his life and flushed it completely down the toilet."
00:14:28.576,00:14:29.785,I did?
00:14:33.914,00:14:38.294,"Hey, Gramps, I told you two coats of wax on my car, not just one!"
00:14:38.836,00:14:41.839,"Hey, hey, I just put the second coat on last week."
00:14:41.922,00:14:44.758,-Yeah? With your eyes closed? -Are you two related?
00:14:44.842,00:14:48.387,Hello? Hello? Anybody home?
00:14:48.470,00:14:51.223,"What do you think, Griff just calls me Grandpa for his health?"
00:14:53.976,00:14:56.145,What the hell am I paying you for?
00:14:56.228,00:14:59.231,"Hey, kid, say hello to your grandma for me."
00:15:04.194,00:15:07.281,"And, McFly, don't go anywhere! You're next!"
00:15:13.621,00:15:15.331,I got it working.
00:15:15.414,00:15:17.958,My dad taught me about these.
00:15:21.629,00:15:23.422,"I'll show you, kid."
00:15:24.340,00:15:26.300,I'm a crack shot at this.
00:15:33.766,00:15:35.935,That's like a baby's toy.
00:15:38.187,00:15:39.396,Baby's toy?
00:15:48.030,00:15:49.365,Pepsi Perfect.
00:15:49.448,00:15:51.283,-Damn! -Pepsi.
00:15:56.455,00:15:58.540,I thought I told you to stay in here!
00:15:58.624,00:16:02.002,"Griff. Guys, how's it going?"
00:16:03.003,00:16:04.672,-McFly! -Yeah?
00:16:05.631,00:16:07.091,-McFly! -What?
00:16:07.174,00:16:08.676,Your shoe's unvelked.
00:16:13.847,00:16:18.686,"So, McFly, have you made a decision about tonight's opportunity?"
00:16:18.769,00:16:20.896,"Um, yeah, Griff. You know, I was thinking about it."
00:16:20.980,00:16:24.608,"I'm not sure, because I just think, you know, it might be a little bit dangerous, so..."
00:16:26.026,00:16:27.277,"What's wrong, McFly?"
00:16:28.529,00:16:30.197,You got no scrote?
00:16:36.203,00:16:37.413,He's a complete wimp.
00:16:37.496,00:16:41.000,"What's it gonna be, McFly? Are you in or out?"
00:16:41.083,00:16:43.794,"Um, I just... I'm... I'm not sure that I should."
00:16:43.877,00:16:46.922,"You know, because I think that I should discuss it with my father."
00:16:47.006,00:16:48.549,-Your father? -Your father?
00:16:48.632,00:16:50.843,"Wrong answer, McFly! You lose!"
00:16:54.096,00:16:57.266,"Okay, Griff, I'll do it. I'll do it, buddy. Whatever you say."
00:16:57.349,00:16:59.059,Stay down and shut up.
00:17:00.561,00:17:02.146,"Keep pedaling, you two!"
00:17:13.240,00:17:17.202,"Now, let's hear the right answer."
00:17:18.704,00:17:19.872,Well!
00:17:20.456,00:17:23.375,Since when did you become the physical type?
00:17:23.459,00:17:24.918,"The answer's no, Griff."
00:17:25.711,00:17:27.963,"-No? -Yeah. What are you, deaf and stupid?"
00:17:28.047,00:17:29.715,I said no!
00:17:37.890,00:17:40.184,"What did you call me, Griff?"
00:17:43.604,00:17:46.356,Nobody calls me...
00:17:49.151,00:17:50.569,chicken.
00:18:00.662,00:18:02.581,"-All right, punk! -Hey, look!"
00:18:18.180,00:18:20.516,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:18:20.599,00:18:22.976,"Stop! Little girl, little girl. Stop."
00:18:23.060,00:18:25.312,"-Hey! -Look, I need to borrow your..."
00:18:26.146,00:18:27.439,Hoverboard?
00:18:30.776,00:18:32.152,There!
00:18:38.325,00:18:40.244,He's on a Hoverboard.
00:19:15.404,00:19:17.865,There's something very familiar about all this.
00:19:53.275,00:19:57.196,-Those boards don't work on water! -Unless you've got power!
00:20:22.888,00:20:24.139,Hook on!
00:20:33.190,00:20:34.650,Batter up!
00:21:03.971,00:21:05.472,Holy shit!
00:21:10.644,00:21:12.187,Buttheads.
00:21:27.411,00:21:28.954,Jacket drying.
00:21:31.456,00:21:33.458,Your jacket is now dry.
00:21:36.962,00:21:39.339,"Hey, kid. Hey, little girl, thanks."
00:21:39.423,00:21:41.967,Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.
00:21:44.636,00:21:48.056,"Hey, kid. Throw in 100 bucks, will you, and help save the clock tower."
00:21:48.140,00:21:50.475,"-I... Sorry, no. -Come on, kid."
00:21:50.559,00:21:53.353,"-That's an important historical landmark! -Look, some other time."
00:22:01.361,00:22:03.905,"-Against Miami? -Yeah, it's something, huh?"
00:22:03.989,00:22:06.533,Who would've thought? 100-1 shot!
00:22:06.616,00:22:12.080,"I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, -put some money on the Cubs. -I just meant, Miami..."
00:22:13.832,00:22:15.125,What did you just say?
00:22:15.208,00:22:17.627,I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season.
00:22:17.711,00:22:19.338,Put some money on the Cubbies!
00:22:25.844,00:22:27.345,It has a dust jacket.
00:22:27.429,00:22:29.765,Books used to have these to protect the covers.
00:22:29.848,00:22:31.600,"Of course, that was before they had dust-repellent paper."
00:22:31.683,00:22:32.517,Ah.
00:22:32.601,00:22:37.189,"And if you're interested in dust, we have a quaint little piece from the 1980s."
00:22:37.272,00:22:38.398,It's called a DustBuster.
00:22:42.903,00:22:45.489,-I can't lose. -Marty! Marty! Up here!
00:22:46.698,00:22:49.910,"-Hey, Doc, what's going on? -Stand by. I'll park over there."
00:22:54.206,00:22:56.083,"Hey, right on time."
00:22:56.166,00:22:57.751,Flying DeLorean.
00:22:57.834,00:23:00.253,I haven't seen one of those in 30 years.
00:23:01.421,00:23:02.589,Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.
00:23:04.174,00:23:07.052,"Hey, I'm walking here! I'm walking here!"
00:23:07.969,00:23:12.349,"-What the hell? -Don't drive tranked, low-res scuzzball!"
00:23:13.433,00:23:14.768,Two of them?
00:23:15.268,00:23:17.479,I left him in a suspended animation kennel.
00:23:17.562,00:23:19.022,Einstein never knew I was gone!
00:23:20.190,00:23:24.361,Marty! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?
00:23:24.820,00:23:28.198,"Oh, yeah, Doc, listen, my kid showed up. All hell broke loose."
00:23:28.281,00:23:29.866,Your kid?
00:23:29.950,00:23:33.370,"Great Scott, the sleep inducer. I was afraid of this."
00:23:33.453,00:23:38.333,"Because I used it on Jennifer, there wasn't enough power left to knock your son out for a full hour. Damn!"
00:23:38.416,00:23:40.669,"Doc, Doc, Doc, look at this!"
00:23:40.752,00:23:42.420,It's changing.
00:23:54.933,00:23:57.185,I was framed!
00:23:57.269,00:24:00.355,"Yes! Yes, of course!"
00:24:01.523,00:24:05.735,"Because this Hoverboard incident has now occurred, Griff now goes to jail."
00:24:05.819,00:24:09.239,"Therefore, your son won't go with him tonight, and that robbery will never take place."
00:24:09.322,00:24:14.661,"Thus, history, future history, has now been altered, and this is the proof!"
00:24:14.744,00:24:17.080,"Marty, we've succeeded, not exactly as I planned, but no matter."
00:24:17.164,00:24:19.291,Let's go get Jennifer and go home!
00:24:25.255,00:24:27.591,"-What's this? -Uh, it's a souvenir."
00:24:27.674,00:24:29.968,50 years of sports statistics.
00:24:30.051,00:24:31.803,"Hardly recreational reading material, Marty."
00:24:31.928,00:24:35.640,"Well, hey, Doc, what's the harm in bringing back a little info on the future?"
00:24:35.724,00:24:37.809,"You know, maybe we could place a couple bets."
00:24:37.893,00:24:41.897,"Marty, I didn't invent the time machine for financial gain!"
00:24:41.980,00:24:44.691,The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity.
00:24:44.774,00:24:49.446,"Where we've been, where we're going, the pitfalls and the possibilities, the perils and the promise."
00:24:49.529,00:24:52.824,"Perhaps even an answer to that universal question, Why?"
00:24:52.908,00:24:55.076,"Hey, Doc, I'm all for that."
00:24:55.160,00:24:57.662,What's wrong with making a few bucks on the side?
00:24:57.746,00:25:01.249,I am going to put this in the trash.
00:25:03.168,00:25:04.544,Great Scott!
00:25:07.964,00:25:13.762,"McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street, Hilldale, age 47."
00:25:13.929,00:25:16.556,Forty-seven? That's a hell of a good face-lift.
00:25:16.932,00:25:18.099,"What the hell are they doing, Doc?"
00:25:18.183,00:25:20.143,They used her thumbprint to assess her ID.
00:25:20.227,00:25:24.105,"Since her thumbprint never changes over the years, they simply assume she's the Jennifer of the future."
00:25:24.189,00:25:25.398,"Well, we gotta stop them."
00:25:25.482,00:25:27.275,What are we gonna say? That we're time travelers?
00:25:27.359,00:25:28.485,They'd have us committed.
00:25:28.568,00:25:30.946,She's clean. That means we take her home.
00:25:31.029,00:25:34.241,Home? To Hilldale? It'll be dark by the time we get out there.
00:25:34.324,00:25:37.786,That's it. They're taking her home to your future home!
00:25:37.869,00:25:41.164,"We'll arrive shortly thereafter, get her out of there and go back to 1985."
00:25:41.248,00:25:44.125,You mean I'm gonna see where I live? I'm gonna see myself as an old man?
00:25:47.796,00:25:50.548,Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self!
00:25:50.632,00:25:53.677,The consequences of that could be disastrous!
00:25:53.760,00:25:56.513,"-Doc, what do you mean? -I foresee two possibilities."
00:25:56.596,00:26:10.902,"One, coming face to face with herself 30 years older would put her into shock, and she'd simply pass out, or two, the encounter could create a time paradox, the results of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the space-time continuum and destroy the entire universe!"
00:26:10.986,00:26:12.696,"Granted, that's a worst-case scenario."
00:26:12.779,00:26:16.741,"The destruction might, in fact, be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy."
00:26:17.617,00:26:19.494,"Well, that's a relief."
00:26:23.415,00:26:27.085,Let's go. I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself.
00:26:28.712,00:26:31.881,The skyway's jammed. It's gonna take us forever to get there.
00:26:31.965,00:26:33.466,And this stays here.
00:26:33.550,00:26:35.552,I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling.
00:26:35.635,00:26:37.971,I invented a time machine to travel through time!
00:26:38.054,00:26:40.098,"I know. I know. I know, Doc."
00:26:49.232,00:26:53.820,"So, Doc Brown invented a time machine."
00:27:20.096,00:27:21.598,Hilldale.
00:27:22.599,00:27:26.436,"Nothing but a breeding ground for tranks, lobos and zipheads."
00:27:26.519,00:27:28.438,"Yeah, they ought to tear this whole place down."
00:27:38.239,00:27:41.785,"Ma'am, you should reprogram. It's dangerous to enter without lights on."
00:27:45.080,00:27:49.376,Just take it easy and you'll be fine. And be careful in the future.
00:27:50.377,00:27:51.878,The future?
00:27:53.129,00:27:55.215,"Have a nice day, Mrs. McFly."
00:28:01.429,00:28:03.681,you're tuned to the Scenery Channel.
00:28:09.062,00:28:10.730,I'm in the future.
00:28:23.201,00:28:25.995,I get married in the Chapel O Love?
00:28:28.832,00:28:30.917,I gotta get out of here!
00:28:35.505,00:28:36.798,Mom!
00:28:45.557,00:28:47.976,"Mom? Mom, is that you?"
00:28:52.772,00:28:54.899,-Grandma Lorraine! -Sweetheart!
00:28:54.983,00:28:56.109,-Hi! -Hi!
00:28:56.192,00:28:59.028,"-What happened to Grandpa? -Oh, he threw his back out again."
00:28:59.112,00:29:02.532,-How's Granddad's little pumpkin? -How did you do that? How did he do that?
00:29:05.118,00:29:07.954,Are your folks home yet? I brought pizza for everyone.
00:29:08.037,00:29:10.123,"-Oh, who's going to eat all that? -Oh, I will."
00:29:10.373,00:29:12.167,Damn this traffic!
00:29:12.250,00:29:14.169,"Jennifer, that is, old Jennifer, usually gets home around now."
00:29:14.252,00:29:15.837,I hope we're not too late.
00:29:19.799,00:29:21.009,"What is it? What's the matter, Doc?"
00:29:21.092,00:29:23.678,"For a moment, I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display."
00:29:23.762,00:29:25.972,I thought it was following us. Weird.
00:29:32.145,00:29:35.815,"Daddy threw him out of the house. Now, we can't get anybody to fix it."
00:29:35.899,00:29:38.276,"Oh, look how worn out this is."
00:29:39.277,00:29:45.700,"Your father's biggest problem, Marlene, is that he loses all self-control when someone calls him chicken."
00:29:45.784,00:29:47.577,"How many times have we heard it, George?"
00:29:47.660,00:29:49.162,"Mom, I can't let them..."
00:29:49.287,00:29:51.206,-think I'm chicken. Mmm. -Think I'm chicken.
00:29:51.289,00:29:53.583,"You're right. Well, you're right!"
00:29:55.126,00:29:59.464,"your father tried to prove he wasn't chicken, and he ended up in an automobile accident."
00:30:15.063,00:30:17.690,"All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer."
00:30:18.608,00:30:21.778,"I don't believe it. I live in Hilldale? This is great! Way to go, McFly."
00:30:21.861,00:30:24.864,"Marty, stay here. Just change clothes. If I need you, I'll holler."
00:30:24.948,00:30:26.616,"Oh, come on, Doc, I wanna check out my house."
00:30:26.699,00:30:28.701,We can't risk you running into your older self.
00:30:28.785,00:30:30.537,"Come on, Einie, let's go."
00:30:30.620,00:30:33.039,"Where's Jennifer, huh? Where's Jennifer?"
00:30:33.122,00:30:34.666,Hilldale.
00:30:35.750,00:30:36.835,This is bitching.
00:30:45.760,00:30:48.346,-That will be $174.50. -Here.
00:30:48.429,00:30:50.181,"I'd be careful, old timer. This is a rough neighborhood."
00:30:50.265,00:30:51.474,-Where's my receipt? -Right here. Here it is.
00:31:08.950,00:31:13.079,That accident caused a chain reaction that sent Marty's life straight down the tubes.
00:31:13.162,00:31:17.000,"If not for that accident, your father's life would have turned out very differently."
00:31:17.083,00:31:25.258,"The man in the Rolls-Royce wouldn't have pressed charges, Marty wouldn't have broken his hand, and he wouldn't have given up on his music, and he wouldn't have spent all those years feeling sorry for himself."
00:31:25.341,00:31:26.926,"Hey, Mom, nice pants."
00:31:30.096,00:31:31.764,-she felt sorry for him. -Mom?
00:31:32.348,00:31:33.600,Such a sweet girl.
00:31:42.191,00:31:44.027,"bringing you the world's weather, 24 hours a day."
00:31:45.320,00:31:48.114,-Weather conditions remain the same... -All board-certified implant surgeons...
00:31:48.197,00:31:49.699,With a minor warm front...
00:31:53.870,00:31:56.456,That's right. He's home. Dad's home.
00:32:02.337,00:32:04.213,What the hell is this?
00:32:06.507,00:32:09.260,Yeah. That's better. Damned kids.
00:32:12.847,00:32:14.807,Watching a little TV for a change?
00:32:27.362,00:32:28.821,Son of a...
00:33:19.330,00:33:21.040,"Hydrate level four, please."
00:33:25.837,00:33:27.130,Mmm.
00:33:35.388,00:33:37.515,I'm sorry. I missed that whole thing.
00:33:41.769,00:33:47.442,"I'm not sure where Jennifer is, Mom. She should have been home hours ago."
00:33:47.525,00:33:49.152,I'm having a hard time keeping track of her these days.
00:33:49.235,00:33:51.070,"Hey, fruit."
00:33:51.154,00:33:52.488,"-Fruit, please. -She's in one of those moods, I guess."
00:33:52.572,00:33:53.990,-Thank you. -I don't know.
00:33:55.825,00:33:59.454,"Oh, yeah. Great, Mom. We're more like a couple of teenagers, you know."
00:34:01.956,00:34:03.750,"Dad, telephone. It's Needles."
00:34:04.542,00:34:05.960,"Dad, it's for you."
00:34:07.003,00:34:09.922,"All right. Well, I'll take that in the den. Excuse me."
00:34:10.006,00:34:11.883,Retract.
00:34:15.720,00:34:20.058,"Hey, hey, the big M. How's it hanging, McFly?"
00:34:20.767,00:34:21.893,"Hey, Needles."
00:34:21.976,00:34:23.061,Needles?
00:34:23.144,00:34:25.563,"So, did you take look at that little business proposal of mine?"
00:34:28.608,00:34:32.153,"If this thing works, it'll solve all your financial problems."
00:34:32.236,00:34:35.364,"And if it doesn't work, Needles, I could get fired."
00:34:35.448,00:34:39.285,"It's illegal. I mean, what if the Jits is monitoring, huh?"
00:34:39.368,00:34:42.663,"-The Jits will never find out. -Oh, God."
00:34:42.747,00:34:43.873,Come on.
00:34:43.956,00:34:47.335,"Stick your card in the slot, and I'll handle it."
00:34:48.002,00:34:50.755,Unless you want everyone in the division to think you're...
00:34:50.838,00:34:52.673,chicken.
00:34:56.636,00:34:59.889,"Nobody calls me chicken, Needles."
00:34:59.972,00:35:02.016,-Nobody! -All right.
00:35:03.017,00:35:04.268,Prove it.
00:35:08.856,00:35:10.358,All right.
00:35:10.858,00:35:12.652,"All right, Needles."
00:35:15.988,00:35:19.325,Here's my card. Scan it. I'm in.
00:35:19.826,00:35:22.787,"Thanks, McFly. I'll see you at the plant tomorrow."
00:35:33.756,00:35:38.302,"McFly, I was monitoring that scan you just interfaced."
00:35:38.386,00:35:40.054,You are terminated!
00:35:40.138,00:35:43.641,"Terminated. No! No! It wasn't my fault, sir. It was Needles."
00:35:43.724,00:35:45.852,-Needles was behind the whole thing. -And you cooperated.
00:35:45.935,00:35:48.104,"-No, I didn't. It was a sting operation. -It was illegal."
00:35:48.229,00:35:51.232,"-I was setting him up. -And you knew. McFly, read my fax!"
00:35:51.315,00:35:55.444,"No! Please, no. I cannot be fired. I'm fired."
00:36:06.664,00:36:09.167,"Oh, this is heavy."
00:36:10.001,00:36:12.545,What am I going to tell Jennifer?
00:36:12.628,00:36:14.338,Jennifer. Jennifer.
00:36:14.672,00:36:16.966,"Oh, Doc, am I glad to see you."
00:36:17.466,00:36:20.595,Go out the front door. I'll meet you there.
00:36:20.678,00:36:23.181,But it doesn't open. There's no doorknob.
00:36:23.264,00:36:25.474,Press your thumb to the plate.
00:36:25.558,00:36:27.435,What plate?
00:36:41.574,00:36:43.576,"Marty, what does this fax mean?"
00:36:43.659,00:36:45.203,"Oh, Mom, it's a joke, an office joke."
00:36:45.286,00:36:46.454,-A joke? -Kind of a joke fax.
00:36:48.164,00:36:49.999,"No, Mom, Mom, Mom, calm down."
00:36:50.082,00:36:52.627,I wasn't yelling. Needles and I were just kind of joking.
00:37:02.136,00:37:04.138,-I'm young! -I'm old!
00:37:13.481,00:37:15.024,Marty! Marty!
00:37:15.107,00:37:17.151,"Marty, come quick! Quick!"
00:37:36.837,00:37:38.297,She'll be fine.
00:37:38.381,00:37:43.427,"Let's get her back to 1985, and then I'm gonna destroy the time machine."
00:37:43.511,00:37:44.595,Destroy it?
00:37:44.679,00:37:48.099,"What about that all that stuff about humanity, where we're going and why?"
00:37:48.182,00:37:50.685,"The risks are just too great, as this incident proves."
00:37:50.768,00:37:55.564,And I was behaving responsibly. You can imagine the danger if the time machine were to fall into the wrong hands.
00:37:58.859,00:38:05.324,"My only regret is that I'll never get a chance to visit my favorite historical era, the Old West."
00:38:05.700,00:38:09.453,But time traveling is just too dangerous.
00:38:09.537,00:38:18.963,"Better that I devote myself to studying the other great mystery of the universe, women."
00:38:21.007,00:38:24.593,"Marty, Einie, brace yourselves for temporal displacement."
00:38:35.062,00:38:36.731,Did we make it?
00:38:40.609,00:38:41.986,Are we back?
00:38:48.826,00:38:49.869,We're back.
00:39:10.765,00:39:12.141,Let's put her in the swing.
00:39:12.224,00:39:15.478,"Then I'll take you home, and you can come back in your truck and wake her."
00:39:15.561,00:39:20.900,"When she awakens here in her own house and it's dark, you should be able to convince her that it was all a dream."
00:39:20.983,00:39:23.736,Wait a minute. We're just gonna leave her here on the porch?
00:39:23.819,00:39:27.073,The disorientation will help convince her that it was all a dream.
00:39:27.156,00:39:29.033,How long do you think she's gonna be out?
00:39:29.116,00:39:31.660,I'm not quite sure. She received quite a shock.
00:39:31.744,00:39:35.373,"Could be for a few minutes. Most probably, a couple of hours."
00:39:35.456,00:39:36.957,You better bring smelling salts back with you.
00:39:37.041,00:39:38.542,"Hey, you're the doc, Doc."
00:39:38.626,00:39:39.627,"All right. Come on. Let's go, Einie."
00:39:42.463,00:39:44.507,Don't worry. She'll be fine.
00:39:45.591,00:39:48.302,I don't remember bars being on these windows.
00:40:04.985,00:40:08.072,"If you need me, I'll be back at my lab dismantling this thing."
00:40:08.155,00:40:09.365,Right.
00:40:26.715,00:40:28.384,What the hell?
00:40:46.235,00:40:47.945,"Hey, hey. Hey, wait. Wait a minute."
00:40:49.822,00:40:51.991,-Help! Help! Rape! Mom! -Okay. Okay.
00:40:52.074,00:40:54.869,"-Dad, help! -Freeze, sucker!"
00:40:54.952,00:40:56.495,"-He jumped me! -Hey, it's okay. I don't want any trouble."
00:41:00.166,00:41:01.500,What are you doing in here with my daughter?
00:41:01.584,00:41:03.085,"Hey, listen, I'm just in the wrong house."
00:41:03.169,00:41:05.463,"You got that right, you little son of a..."
00:41:06.005,00:41:10.009,"-Hey, look, I made a mistake. -Damn right, you made a mistake!"
00:41:13.053,00:41:15.181,"That's right. You keep running, sucker!"
00:41:15.264,00:41:18.184,And you tell that realty company that I ain't selling! You hear?
00:41:18.267,00:41:20.227,We ain't gonna be terrorized!
00:42:02.353,00:42:04.813,This has gotta be the wrong year.
00:42:22.873,00:42:24.291,1985?
00:42:25.834,00:42:26.835,It can't be.
00:42:31.757,00:42:34.468,"So, you're the son of a bitch who's been stealing my newspapers."
00:42:34.552,00:42:35.970,Mr. Strickland.
00:42:36.470,00:42:40.057,"-Mr. Strickland. It's me, sir. It's Marty. -Who?"
00:42:40.140,00:42:43.018,"It's Marty McFly. Marty McFly. Don't you know me, sir? From school, sir."
00:42:43.102,00:42:46.146,"I've never seen you before in my life, but you look to me like a slacker."
00:42:46.230,00:42:48.566,"Yeah, that's right. That's right. I am a slacker."
00:42:48.649,00:42:50.693,Don't you remember? You gave me detention last week.
00:42:50.776,00:42:53.529,Last week? The school burned down six years ago.
00:42:53.612,00:42:56.365,"Now, you got exactly three seconds to get off my porch with your nuts intact."
00:42:56.448,00:42:59.868,"-One. -Oh! Please, Mr. Strickland, I just want to know what the hell's going on here."
00:43:21.849,00:43:23.601,"Eat lead, slackers!"
00:43:30.733,00:43:34.695,"Watch where you're going, crazy drunk pedestrian."
00:43:35.154,00:43:36.488,Red.
00:44:37.007,00:44:44.890,"Dedicated to Hill Valley's number one citizen and America's greatest living folk hero, the one and only Biff Tannen."
00:44:45.349,00:44:49.019,"Of course, we've all heard the legend, but who is the man?"
00:44:49.103,00:44:54.483,"Inside, you will learn how Biff Tannen became one of the richest and most powerful men in America."
00:44:54.566,00:45:02.491,"Learn the amazing history of the Tannen family, starting with his great-grandfather, Buford Mad Dog Tannen, fastest gun in the West."

00:45:12.960,00:45:19.591,Share in the excitement of a fabulous winning streak that earned him the nickname The Luckiest Man on Earth.
00:45:19.675,00:45:24.471,Learn how Biff parlayed that lucky winning streak into the vast empire called Biffco.
00:45:24.555,00:45:34.523,"Discover how in 1979, Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated courthouse into a beautiful casino hotel."
00:45:34.606,00:45:38.360,I just want to say one thing. God bless America!
00:45:43.991,00:45:55.210,"and relive Biff's happiest moment as, in 1973, he realized his life-long romantic dream by marrying his high school sweetheart, Third time's the charm."
00:45:58.046,00:46:02.426,No! No!
00:46:02.509,00:46:04.678,"-Hey, hey, you're coming with us upstairs. -Let me go."
00:46:04.761,00:46:07.473,"Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way."
00:46:22.029,00:46:25.073,You've been asleep for almost two hours.
00:46:25.157,00:46:26.658,Ugh.
00:46:26.742,00:46:29.995,I had a horrible nightmare. It was terrible.
00:46:30.454,00:46:36.335,"Well, you're safe and sound now, back on the good old 27th floor."
00:46:37.252,00:46:39.213,Twenty-seventh floor!
00:46:44.801,00:46:47.596,"Mom? Mom, that can't be you."
00:46:48.388,00:46:51.433,"Well, yes, it's me, Marty. Are you all right?"
00:46:51.517,00:46:54.228,I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just that you're so...
00:46:54.311,00:46:55.395,You're so...
00:46:56.438,00:46:57.689,big.
00:46:57.814,00:47:00.817,"Oh. Everything's gonna be fine, Marty. Are you hungry?"
00:47:00.901,00:47:02.486,I... I can call room service.
00:47:04.530,00:47:05.864,Room service?
00:47:09.368,00:47:10.494,My father?
00:47:12.621,00:47:15.374,"You're supposed to be in Switzerland, you little son of a bitch!"
00:47:15.457,00:47:16.583,My father!
00:47:16.667,00:47:18.669,Did you get kicked out of another boarding school?
00:47:18.752,00:47:19.753,"Damn it, Lorraine."
00:47:19.836,00:47:22.589,Do you know how much perfectly good dough I've blown on this no-good kid of yours?
00:47:22.673,00:47:24.007,Huh? On all three of them?
00:47:24.091,00:47:27.177,What the hell do you care? We can afford it.
00:47:27.761,00:47:31.557,The least we can do with all that money is provide a better life for our children.
00:47:31.640,00:47:33.934,"Oh, hold on one second. Let's get this straight."
00:47:34.017,00:47:36.144,"Marty is your kid, not mine."
00:47:36.228,00:47:39.273,And all the money in the world wouldn't do jack shit for that lazy bum.
00:47:39.356,00:47:41.525,"Stop it, Biff. Just stop it."
00:47:41.608,00:47:42.859,Look at him.
00:47:42.943,00:47:45.028,"He's a butthead, just like his old man was."
00:47:47.948,00:47:51.535,Don't you dare speak that way about George.
00:47:53.161,00:47:55.497,You're not even half the man he was.
00:48:12.472,00:48:14.558,You wanna take a poke at me?
00:48:17.978,00:48:20.814,"Damn it, Biff. That's it. I'm leaving."
00:48:21.982,00:48:24.610,"So, go ahead. But think about this, Lorraine."
00:48:24.776,00:48:28.614,"Who's gonna pay for all your clothes, huh? And your jewelry and your liquor?"
00:48:28.697,00:48:31.867,"Who's gonna pay for your cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?"
00:48:31.950,00:48:35.329,You were the one who wanted me to get these things.
00:48:35.912,00:48:38.665,"If you want them back, you can have them."
00:48:38.749,00:48:44.212,"Look, Lorraine. You walk out that door, and I won't only cut off you. I'll cut off your kids."
00:48:44.921,00:48:47.049,"-You wouldn't. -Oh, wouldn't I?"
00:48:47.132,00:48:50.302,"First your daughter, Linda. I'll cancel all her credit cards."
00:48:50.385,00:48:52.929,She can settle her debts with the bank all by herself.
00:48:53.013,00:48:56.099,"Your idiot son, Dave. I'll get his probation revoked."
00:48:56.183,00:48:58.268,And as for Marty?
00:48:58.352,00:49:03.398,"Well, maybe you'd like to have all three of your kids behind bars, just like your brother, Joey."
00:49:03.482,00:49:06.193,"One big, happy, jailbird family."
00:49:08.904,00:49:12.491,"All right, Biff. You win. I'll stay."
00:49:16.161,00:49:20.082,"As for you, I'll be back up here in an hour, so you better not be."
00:49:31.385,00:49:33.929,"He was right, and I was wrong."
00:49:36.306,00:49:38.016,Mom!
00:49:38.100,00:49:40.977,"Mom, what are you saying? You're actually defending him."
00:49:41.061,00:49:53.699,"I had it coming. He's my husband, and he takes care of all of us, Your husband! How could he be your husband?"
00:49:54.241,00:49:57.619,-How could you leave Dad for him? -Leave Dad?
00:49:57.703,00:50:02.290,"-Marty, are you feeling all right? -No. No, I'm not feeling all right!"
00:50:02.374,00:50:07.879,"I don't understand one damn thing that's going on around here, and why nobody can give me a simple, straight answer."
00:50:08.130,00:50:11.007,"Oh, they must have hit you over the head hard this time."
00:50:11.091,00:50:14.177,"Mom, I just want to know one thing."
00:50:14.261,00:50:17.264,Where's my father? Where's George McFly?
00:50:18.724,00:50:25.522,"Marty, George, your father, is in the same place he's been for the past 12 years."
00:50:27.899,00:50:29.860,Oak Park Cemetery.
00:50:55.594,00:50:56.928,No.
00:50:59.473,00:51:02.267,No! This can't be happening!
00:51:03.310,00:51:05.562,"March 15th, 1973."
00:51:05.645,00:51:08.857,"No! Oh, please, God, no!"
00:51:10.317,00:51:14.321,"No, please, God. Please, God, no. This can't be happening."
00:51:14.988,00:51:16.406,This can't be happening.
00:51:18.116,00:51:19.618,This can't be...
00:51:19.701,00:51:22.162,"I'm afraid it is happening, Marty. All of it."
00:51:22.579,00:51:23.747,Doc!
00:51:23.830,00:51:26.666,"When I learned about your father, I figured you'd come here."
00:51:29.211,00:51:31.880,Then you know what happened to him?
00:51:33.381,00:51:39.221,"Do you know what happened March 15th, 1973?"
00:51:41.181,00:51:42.849,"Yes, Marty. I know."
00:51:45.143,00:51:46.728,to try to make sense out of all the madness.
00:51:46.937,00:51:50.440,"The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers."
00:51:50.524,00:51:51.983,"I don't get it, Doc."
00:51:52.192,00:51:55.695,"I mean, how can all this be happening? It's like we're in hell or something."
00:51:55.779,00:51:58.782,"No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I can't imagine hell being much worse."
00:52:00.867,00:52:03.578,"Oh, Einie. I'm sorry, boy."
00:52:04.287,00:52:07.624,"The lab is an awful, awful, awful, awful mess."
00:52:11.044,00:52:19.678,"Obviously, the time continuum has been disrupted, creating this new temporal event sequence -resulting in this alternate reality. -English, Doc."
00:52:19.761,00:52:22.055,"Here, here, here. Let me illustrate."
00:52:26.768,00:52:30.981,Imagine that this line represents time.
00:52:31.064,00:52:35.819,"Here's the present, 1985, the future and the past."
00:52:37.571,00:52:46.329,"Prior to this point in time, somewhere in the past, the timeline skewed into this tangent creating an alternate 1985."
00:52:46.413,00:52:53.753,"Alternate to you, me and Einstein, but reality for everyone else."
00:52:58.049,00:52:59.885,Recognize this?
00:53:00.093,00:53:02.178,It's the bag the sports book came in.
00:53:02.262,00:53:05.098,"I know, because the receipt was still inside."
00:53:05.181,00:53:09.102,I found them in the time machine along with this.
00:53:14.774,00:53:18.486,"It's the top of Biff's cane. I mean, old Biff from the future."
00:53:18.570,00:53:24.910,Correct. It was in the time machine because Biff was in the time machine with the sports almanac.
00:53:25.535,00:53:26.661,Holy shit.
00:53:26.745,00:53:37.005,"You see, while we were in the future, Biff got the sports book, stole the time machine, went back in time, and gave the book to himself at some point in the past."
00:53:37.297,00:53:46.765,"Look, huh. It says right here that Biff made his first million betting on a horse race in 1958."
00:53:47.349,00:53:48.683,He wasn't just lucky.
00:53:48.767,00:53:52.270,He knew because he had all the race results in the sports almanac.
00:53:52.479,00:53:55.231,That's how he made his entire fortune.
00:53:55.982,00:53:58.276,Look at his pocket with a magnifying glass.
00:54:06.326,00:54:08.036,He must have been listening when I...
00:54:10.580,00:54:13.792,It's my fault. The whole thing is my fault.
00:54:13.875,00:54:17.462,"If I hadn't bought that damn book, none of this would have ever happened."
00:54:17.545,00:54:19.881,"-Well, it's all in the past. -You mean, the future?"
00:54:19.965,00:54:30.392,Whatever. It demonstrates precisely how time travel can be misused and why the time machine must be destroyed after we straighten all of this out.
00:54:30.475,00:54:34.729,"Right. So we go back to the future, and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine."
00:54:34.813,00:54:54.457,"We can't, because if we travel into the future from this point in time, it will be the future of this reality, in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother and in which this has happened to me."
00:55:00.005,00:55:09.055,No. Our only chance to repair the present is in the past at the point where the timeline skewed into this tangent.
00:55:09.139,00:55:24.904,"In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality, we have to find out the exact date and the specific circumstances of how, where and when young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac."
00:55:27.699,00:55:28.783,I'll ask him.
00:55:56.936,00:55:59.105,The guy is brilliant.
00:55:59.606,00:56:01.232,"Hey, what the hell's going..."
00:56:03.902,00:56:05.070,"Party's over, Biff."
00:56:06.946,00:56:08.239,"Sorry, ladies."
00:56:08.323,00:56:11.076,How did you get past my security downstairs?
00:56:11.743,00:56:13.453,There's a little matter we need to talk about.
00:56:13.536,00:56:17.832,"-Yeah. Money, right? Well, forget it. -No. Not money."
00:56:19.751,00:56:23.171,Gray's Sports Almanac.
00:56:26.633,00:56:28.551,"You heard him, girls."
00:56:29.094,00:56:30.512,Party's over.
00:56:31.763,00:56:35.266,"Start talking, kid. What else do you know about that book?"
00:56:36.976,00:56:39.771,"First, you tell me how you got it."
00:56:40.271,00:56:43.525,"How, where and when."
00:56:45.944,00:56:48.279,All right. Take a seat.
00:56:52.283,00:56:53.618,Sit down!
00:56:57.789,00:57:00.583,"November 12th, 1955. That was when."
00:57:00.667,00:57:03.837,"November 12th, 1955. That was the date I went back..."
00:57:05.130,00:57:09.175,That was the date of the famous Hill Valley lightning storm.
00:57:10.343,00:57:13.012,You know your history. Very good.
00:57:13.930,00:57:15.682,I'll never forget that Saturday.
00:57:15.765,00:57:20.728,"I'd just picked my car up from the shop, 'cause I'd rolled it in a drag race a few days earlier."
00:57:20.812,00:57:23.481,I thought you crashed into a manure truck.
00:57:24.858,00:57:27.444,How do you know about that?
00:57:27.527,00:57:30.655,-My father told me about it. -Your father?
00:57:31.906,00:57:33.825,Before he died.
00:57:34.868,00:57:36.369,Yeah. Right.
00:57:37.579,00:57:40.457,"So there I was, minding my own business."
00:57:40.540,00:57:43.835,This crazy old codger with a cane shows up.
00:57:43.918,00:57:47.672,He says he's my distant relative. I don't see any resemblance.
00:57:49.674,00:57:52.469,"So he says, How would you like to be rich?"
00:57:53.052,00:57:54.929,"So I said, Sure."
00:57:59.726,00:58:01.728,So he lays this book on me.
00:58:01.853,00:58:06.357,He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event till the end of the century.
00:58:06.441,00:58:09.903,"All I have to do is bet on the winner, and I'll never lose."
00:58:13.114,00:58:14.407,"So I said, What's the catch?"
00:58:14.491,00:58:17.827,"He says, No catch. Just keep it a secret."
00:58:21.915,00:58:25.835,"After that, he disappeared. I never saw him again."
00:58:38.598,00:58:40.808,"Oh, and he told me one more thing."
00:58:40.892,00:58:47.190,"He said, Someday a crazy, wild-eyed scientist, or a kid may show up asking about that book."
00:58:47.273,00:58:49.484,And if that ever happens...
00:58:54.572,00:58:57.909,Funny. I never thought it would be you.
00:58:58.826,00:59:00.537,"Yeah, well, Biff, you're forgetting one thing."
00:59:08.211,00:59:11.297,"You're dead, you little son of a bitch!"
00:59:23.476,00:59:25.770,"-Hey, there he is! -Hey, hey!"
00:59:40.743,00:59:42.036,"Oh, yeah!"
01:00:07.979,01:00:10.690,"Go ahead, kid. Jump."
01:00:11.441,01:00:14.235,A suicide will be nice and neat.
01:00:14.319,01:00:15.987,What if I don't?
01:00:16.904,01:00:18.656,Lead poisoning.
01:00:18.740,01:00:20.617,"What about the police, Biff?"
01:00:20.700,01:00:23.161,They're gonna match up the bullet with that gun.
01:00:23.244,01:00:25.330,"Kid, I own the police."
01:00:27.290,01:00:31.628,"Besides, they couldn't match up the bullet that killed your old man."
01:00:32.086,01:00:33.880,You son of a...
01:00:35.923,01:00:38.384,I suppose it's poetic justice.
01:00:39.218,01:00:43.264,Two McFlys with the same gun.
01:00:54.692,01:00:55.693,Idiot.
01:01:00.698,01:01:01.949,What the hell?
01:01:06.871,01:01:08.373,"Nice shot, Doc!"
01:01:09.916,01:01:13.503,You're not gonna believe this. We gotta go back to 1955.
01:01:13.586,01:01:15.254,I don't believe it.
01:01:29.185,01:01:32.772,Unbelievable that old Biff could've chosen that particular date.
01:01:32.897,01:01:40.863,"It could mean that that point in time inherently contains some sort of cosmic significance, almost as if it were the temporal junction point for the entire space-time continuum."
01:01:40.947,01:01:43.032,"On the other hand, it could just be an amazing coincidence."
01:01:46.619,01:01:50.748,Damn! Got to fix that thing. All right. Time circuits on.
01:01:51.791,01:01:53.876,"What do you mean, time circuits on?"
01:01:53.960,01:01:56.713,"-Doc, we're not going back now. -Yep."
01:01:56.796,01:01:58.548,"Doc, what about Jennifer? What about Einstein?"
01:01:58.631,01:02:00.007,We can't just leave them here.
01:02:00.091,01:02:09.142,"Don't worry, Marty. Assuming we succeed in our mission, this alternate 1985 will be changed back into the real 1985, instantaneously transforming around Jennifer and Einie."
01:02:09.225,01:02:13.604,"Jennifer and Einie will be fine, and they will have absolutely no memory of this horrible place."
01:02:13.688,01:02:15.148,Doc.
01:02:15.773,01:02:17.567,What if we don't succeed?
01:02:18.317,01:02:19.777,We must succeed.
01:02:34.167,01:02:35.877,"Oh, this is heavy, Doc."
01:02:35.960,01:02:37.670,"I mean, it's like I was just here yesterday."
01:02:37.754,01:02:40.840,"You were here yesterday, Marty. You were. Amazing, isn't it?"
01:02:40.923,01:02:44.093,"All right, sunrise should be in about 22 minutes."
01:02:44.177,01:02:47.430,You go into town. Track down young Biff and tail him.
01:02:47.513,01:02:51.684,"Sometime today, old Biff will show up to give young Biff the almanac."
01:02:51.768,01:02:53.853,"Above all, you must not interfere with that event."
01:02:53.936,01:02:58.483,"We must let old Biff believe he's succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955 and bring the DeLorean back to the future."
01:02:58.566,01:02:59.400,Right.
01:02:59.484,01:03:02.570,"Once old Biff is gone, grab the almanac any way that you can."
01:03:02.653,01:03:04.822,"Remember, both of our futures depend on this."
01:03:04.906,01:03:06.866,"You don't have to remind me of that, Doc."
01:03:06.949,01:03:11.537,Here's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.
01:03:11.621,01:03:14.665,I'll stay here and try to repair the short in the time circuit.
01:03:14.749,01:03:21.923,"That way, we don't risk anyone else stealing the time machine, and I won't risk accidentally running into my other self."
01:03:22.006,01:03:27.220,"-Other self? -Yes. There are now two of me here, and there are two of you here."
01:03:27.303,01:03:36.395,"The other me is the Dr. Emmett Brown from 1955, the younger me that helps the other you get back to 1985."
01:03:37.188,01:03:38.815,Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower?
01:03:38.898,01:03:43.569,"-Yeah. -That event doesn't happen until tonight, so you must be very careful not to run into your other self."
01:03:43.653,01:03:44.821,Let me give you some money.
01:03:48.658,01:03:51.911,I have to be prepared for all monetary possibilities.
01:03:51.994,01:03:54.956,"-Get yourself some '50s clothes. -Check, Doc."
01:03:56.165,01:03:58.000,Something inconspicuous.
01:03:59.252,01:04:01.879,"Doc. Come in, Doc. This is Marty. Over."
01:04:04.298,01:04:07.760,"Yeah, Doc. I'm at the address."
01:04:07.844,01:04:11.180,"It's the only Tannen in the book, but I don't think this is Biff's house."
01:04:11.264,01:04:13.140,It looks like some old lady lives here.
01:04:15.393,01:04:19.480,"-Where are you going, Biff? -I'm going to get my car, Grandma."
01:04:19.564,01:04:23.317,"When are you coming back? My feet hurt, and I want you to rub my toes some more."
01:04:23.401,01:04:25.361,"Shut up, you old bag."
01:04:27.864,01:04:29.657,-What ball? -That ball!
01:04:29.740,01:04:31.784,What ball are you talking about?
01:04:33.619,01:04:35.371,-What ball? -Biff!
01:04:47.091,01:04:49.510,"Doc, it is Biff's house. I'm on him."
01:04:59.562,01:05:00.646,Hey.
01:05:03.357,01:05:04.483,"Looking good, Terry."
01:05:06.360,01:05:07.862,but I couldn't get her started.
01:05:07.945,01:05:09.780,You got some kind of kill switch on this thing?
01:05:09.864,01:05:13.367,"No, you just gotta have the right touch. Nobody can start this car but me."
01:05:13.451,01:05:16.621,"-Yeah, the bill comes to $302.57. -Three hundred bucks?"
01:05:16.704,01:05:19.832,"Three hundred bucks for a couple of dents? No, hey, that's bullshit, Terry."
01:05:19.916,01:05:21.042,"No, Biff, it was horse shit."
01:05:22.335,01:05:24.378,We had to pay Old Man Jones 80 bucks to haul it away.
01:05:25.880,01:05:28.215,"-Now, I ought to get something for that. -You want to get something for it?"
01:05:28.299,01:05:30.176,We'll go inside. You can call Old Man Jones.
01:05:30.259,01:05:31.218,If he wants to give you a refund...
01:05:31.302,01:05:36.515,"It's 300 bucks, Terry. If I catch the guy that caused this, I'll break his neck."
01:05:36.933,01:05:39.810,The manure. I remember that.
01:05:46.359,01:05:48.402,"Four cans of Valvoline is fair, Biff."
01:05:48.486,01:05:51.572,-Four cans for a $300 job? -I couldn't even have lunch in the shop.
01:05:51.656,01:05:54.784,-Makes me nauseous. -I should get a case of oil -out of you for a 300 buck job. -You've been inside.
01:05:54.867,01:05:56.535,It smells worse than the bathroom at a gas station.
01:05:59.830,01:06:00.873,Never gonna go away.
01:06:00.957,01:06:02.500,-Last time I do you a favor. Last time. -Thanks a lot.
01:06:04.919,01:06:05.920,Let me see.
01:06:07.880,01:06:09.548,-Oh. -Oh!
01:06:19.684,01:06:22.353,"-Oh, you're going to look... -Well, lookey what we have here."
01:06:22.436,01:06:23.521,"Hey, nice dress, Lorraine."
01:06:23.604,01:06:26.065,"Although, I think you'd look better wearing nothing at all."
01:06:26.148,01:06:29.026,"Biff, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?"
01:06:30.236,01:06:31.612,"There's that dance at school tonight, right."
01:06:31.696,01:06:36.951,"Now that my car's all fixed, I figure I'd cut you a break and give you the honor of going with the best-looking guy in school."
01:06:37.034,01:06:38.077,"Yeah, well, I'm busy."
01:06:38.160,01:06:39.745,"-Yeah, doing what? -Washing my hair."
01:06:39.829,01:06:42.498,"Ah, that's about as funny as a screen door on a battleship."
01:06:42.581,01:06:44.625,"Screen door on a submarine, you dork."
01:06:44.709,01:06:47.294,"Look, Biff, somebody already asked me to the dance."
01:06:47.920,01:06:50.256,Who? That bug George McFly?
01:06:50.715,01:06:55.136,"-I'm going with Calvin Klein, okay? -Calvin Klein? No, it's not okay."
01:06:55.761,01:06:58.806,"-You're going with me, understand? -Get your cooties off me!"
01:06:58.889,01:07:01.017,"When are you gonna get it through your thick skull, Lorraine?"
01:07:01.100,01:07:02.393,You're my girl.
01:07:02.476,01:07:07.106,"Biff Tannen, I wouldn't be your girl even if you had a million dollars!"
01:07:10.693,01:07:13.112,"Yes, you will! It's you and me, Lorraine."
01:07:15.573,01:07:17.366,It's meant to be.
01:07:17.450,01:07:21.620,"I'm going to marry you someday, Lorraine. Someday, you'll be my wife!"
01:07:24.874,01:07:27.376,You always did have a way with women.
01:07:27.460,01:07:29.420,"Get the hell out of my car, old man."
01:07:29.503,01:07:32.465,"You want to marry that girl, Biff? I can help make it happen."
01:07:32.548,01:07:34.592,"Oh, yeah? Who are you, Miss Lonely-Hearts?"
01:07:34.675,01:07:37.511,"Just get in the car, butthead."
01:07:40.681,01:07:44.351,How do you know how to do that? Nobody can start this car but me.
01:07:44.435,01:07:47.980,"Just get in the car, Tannen. Today's your lucky day."
01:07:54.779,01:07:56.322,"If you dent this car, I'll kill you."
01:08:03.120,01:08:07.041,-This cost me 300 bucks! -Would you shut up about the car?
01:08:07.500,01:08:09.418,"Hey, and another thing. How do you know where I live?"
01:08:09.502,01:08:11.670,"Let's just say we're related, Biff."
01:08:11.754,01:08:14.298,"And that being the case, I got a little present for you."
01:08:14.381,01:08:16.550,Something that'll make you rich.
01:08:16.634,01:08:17.760,"You want to be rich, don't you?"
01:08:23.182,01:08:26.393,You see this book? This book tells the future.
01:08:26.477,01:08:29.730,Tells the results of every major sports event till the end of the century.
01:08:29.814,01:08:33.818,"Football, baseball, horse races, boxing."
01:08:34.944,01:08:38.739,"The information in here is worth millions, and I'm giving it to you."
01:08:38.823,01:08:41.408,"Well, that's very nice. Thank you very much."
01:08:41.492,01:08:45.287,"Now, why don't you make like a tree and get out of here?"
01:08:46.288,01:08:50.084,"It's leave, you idiot. Make like a tree and leave."
01:08:50.167,01:08:52.336,You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong.
01:08:52.419,01:08:56.340,"All right, then, leave. And take your book with you."
01:08:56.423,01:09:00.094,Don't you get it? You could make a fortune with this book.
01:09:00.177,01:09:01.595,Let me show you.
01:09:08.686,01:09:12.022,It's 4th and 11 with only 18 seconds left of this game.
01:09:12.148,01:09:15.317,I'd say it's all over for UCLA.
01:09:15.401,01:09:19.113,Bet you a million bucks UCLA wins it 19-17.
01:09:19.196,01:09:22.783,"What are you, deaf, old man? He just said it was over. You lost."
01:09:22.867,01:09:24.285,"Oh, yeah?"
01:09:26.162,01:09:27.663,"It's up. It looks good, folks!"
01:09:27.746,01:09:32.042,It looks very good. Field goal! UCLA wins 19-17.
01:09:32.334,01:09:36.255,Listen to that Coliseum crowd go wild. Jim Decker...
01:09:36.338,01:09:37.548,"All right, pops. What's the gag?"
01:09:37.631,01:09:39.592,How did you know what the score was gonna be?
01:09:41.927,01:09:45.514,"All you gotta do is bet on the winner, and you'll never lose."
01:09:51.061,01:09:53.022,All right. I'll take a look at it.
01:09:58.277,01:10:01.197,"Never, never leave this book laying around."
01:10:01.280,01:10:04.200,"Don't you have a safe? No, you don't have a safe."
01:10:05.409,01:10:10.164,"Get a safe. Keep it locked up. And until then, keep it on you like this."
01:10:10.247,01:10:13.209,"-Hey, what are you doing? -And don't tell anybody about it, either."
01:10:13.292,01:10:14.710,"Oh, and there's one more thing."
01:10:14.793,01:10:22.635,"One day, a kid or a crazy, wild-eyed old man who claims to be a scientist is going to come around asking about this..."
01:10:25.262,01:10:27.514,If that ever happens...
01:10:47.284,01:10:49.536,I'm trapped. Doc.
01:10:49.745,01:10:50.913,"Doc, come in, Doc."
01:10:50.996,01:10:52.831,"-Marty, what's the report? -Biff's gone."
01:10:53.374,01:10:55.501,"He's got the book. The old man's gone, too."
01:10:55.584,01:10:56.627,I'm locked in Biff's garage.
01:10:56.710,01:10:59.088,You gotta fly the DeLorean over here and get me the hell out of here.
01:10:59.421,01:11:01.131,The address is 1809 Mason Street.
01:11:01.215,01:11:05.135,"I can't take the DeLorean out in the daylight, but don't worry, Marty. Somehow I'll get over there."
01:11:05.219,01:11:08.555,"Oh, Doc, wait a minute. Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc."
01:11:10.182,01:11:11.517,Perfect.
01:11:18.524,01:11:21.360,"I told you, Grandma. I'm going to the dance."
01:12:04.528,01:12:05.904,Marty.
01:12:07.906,01:12:10.367,"Marty, Marty. Damn!"
01:12:11.201,01:12:13.245,Where is that kid?
01:12:19.585,01:12:21.628,"Doc. Doc, come in."
01:12:22.338,01:12:23.881,"Come in, Doc."
01:12:24.631,01:12:25.716,"Marty! Marty, come in."
01:12:31.055,01:12:32.306,Marty.
01:12:33.390,01:12:35.017,"Oh, my..."
01:12:36.643,01:12:38.687,Great Scott.
01:12:54.286,01:12:55.662,"Oh, my God."
01:13:00.876,01:13:02.002,"Yo, Doc, Doc, come in."
01:13:02.086,01:13:03.587,"Marty, what happened to you?"
01:13:03.670,01:13:05.339,"I went to Biff's house, and you weren't there."
01:13:05.422,01:13:07.591,You must have just missed me. I'm in the back of Biff's car.
01:13:07.674,01:13:09.676,He's on his way to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.
01:13:10.636,01:13:12.638,"Marty, listen, we may have to abort this entire plan."
01:13:12.721,01:13:14.139,It's getting much too dangerous.
01:13:14.223,01:13:15.808,Don't worry. The book is on Biff's dashboard.
01:13:15.891,01:13:17.226,I'll grab it as soon as we get to the school.
01:13:17.309,01:13:20.854,"Marty, you must be extremely careful not to run into your other self."
01:13:20.938,01:13:22.564,-My other self? -Yes.
01:13:23.315,01:13:27.403,"Remember, your mother is at that exact same dance with you. Yeah."
01:13:27.486,01:13:30.906,"-Right. This could get heavy, Doc. -Heavy, heavy."
01:13:30.989,01:13:33.617,"Marty, whatever happens, you must not let your other self see you!"
01:13:38.455,01:13:39.998,"Yes, you with the hat."
01:13:40.082,01:13:42.292,"-Who, me? -Yes."
01:13:42.668,01:13:46.422,Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths inch wrench out of that toolbox.
01:13:47.506,01:13:49.091,Five-eighths?
01:13:49.174,01:13:50.217,Uh...
01:13:50.717,01:13:53.178,Don't you mean three-quarters?
01:13:53.929,01:13:56.014,"Why, you're right."
01:13:56.807,01:14:01.395,I presume you're conducting some sort of weather experiment.
01:14:03.439,01:14:06.525,That's right. How did you know that?
01:14:06.608,01:14:10.571,"Oh, I happen to have had a little experience in this area."
01:14:10.654,01:14:13.323,"Yes, well, I'm hoping to see some lightning tonight."
01:14:13.407,01:14:16.118,"Although, the weatherman says there's not gonna be any rain."
01:14:16.201,01:14:17.953,"Oh, there's going to be plenty of rain, all right."
01:14:18.036,01:14:20.122,"Wind, thunder, lightning."
01:14:20.205,01:14:24.793,"-It's gonna be one hell of a storm. -Well, thanks. Nice talking to you."
01:14:24.877,01:14:28.714,Maybe we'll bump into each other some time again in the future.
01:14:29.715,01:14:31.341,Or in the past.
01:15:12.424,01:15:14.176,"Doc, Doc! Come in!"
01:16:32.546,01:16:38.093,"Well, go find him. He caused 300 bucks damage to my car, and I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going!"
01:16:38.176,01:16:39.469,"-Drink up, Biff. -Yeah, thanks."
01:17:37.819,01:17:39.571,How nice to see you here.
01:17:39.655,01:17:42.616,"Why, Mr. Strickland, it's nice to see you, sir."
01:17:42.699,01:17:44.201,"Is that liquor I smell, Tannen?"
01:17:44.743,01:17:46.244,"Uh, I... I wouldn't know."
01:17:46.328,01:17:48.872,"I don't know what liquor smells like, 'cause I'm too young to drink it."
01:17:48.955,01:17:50.290,I see.
01:17:50.749,01:17:52.626,And what have we here?
01:17:56.171,01:17:59.675,"Sports statistics, interesting subject. Homework, Tannen?"
01:18:04.638,01:18:07.474,"You've got a real attitude problem. You know that, Tannen? Just watch it."
01:18:07.557,01:18:11.144,"Because one day, I'll have you right where I want you, in detention."
01:18:11.228,01:18:12.312,Slacker!
01:18:32.541,01:18:34.876,I'm going to let them do anything they want.
01:18:34.960,01:18:36.420,Anything at all.
01:18:36.503,01:18:39.464,"-Yeah, I'd like to have that in writing. -Yeah, me, too."
01:18:39.548,01:18:42.300,"Marty, why are you so nervous?"
01:20:52.430,01:20:53.557,No!
01:20:56.351,01:20:57.811,Oh Là Là?
01:20:58.687,01:21:00.146,Oh Là Là?
01:21:02.399,01:21:03.775,Oh Là Là?
01:21:12.033,01:21:14.035,"-Get your damn hands off of her. -Doc, damn it. Come in."
01:21:15.203,01:21:17.706,"Doc! Doc, I'm in trouble. I blew it."
01:21:17.789,01:21:20.208,-Where's the book? -Biff must still have it with him.
01:21:20.375,01:21:22.794,-All I got is the damn cover. -And where's Biff?
01:21:22.878,01:21:24.170,-You're asking for it... -I don't know.
01:21:24.254,01:21:26.506,"-and now, you're going to get it. -Don't you have any idea where he is?"
01:21:28.967,01:21:32.637,"Marty, the entire future depends on you finding Biff and getting that book back!"
01:21:35.682,01:21:39.185,"Stop it, Biff. You'll break his arm. Stop it!"
01:21:43.273,01:21:44.774,Of course!
01:21:45.442,01:21:49.571,I gotta go. I got one chance! My old man is about to deck Biff!
01:22:11.509,01:22:13.094,Talk about déjà vu.
01:22:36.242,01:22:37.494,Let's back up.
01:22:37.577,01:22:40.163,"Let's everybody just back up and give him a little bit of room, okay."
01:22:40.246,01:22:41.456,A little bit of air.
01:22:41.539,01:22:45.669,-It's okay. I know CPR. I know CPR. -Hey.
01:22:45.752,01:22:48.254,-What's CPR? -You!
01:22:52.133,01:22:55.178,"-He's fine. -Hey, did you just take his wallet?"
01:22:55.261,01:22:57.013,He just took that guy's wallet.
01:22:59.975,01:23:01.893,Thank goodness.
01:23:02.852,01:23:04.562,"Great, Marty."
01:23:04.646,01:23:09.025,"As soon as I reload the fusion generator, I'll meet you on the roof of the high school gym."
01:23:09.109,01:23:10.568,On the roof. 10-4.
01:23:10.652,01:23:13.613,"-Hey, it's him! -Hey, he's in disguise."
01:23:13.697,01:23:15.573,"Guys, what's that?"
01:23:26.376,01:23:27.502,Damn!
01:24:15.133,01:24:16.593,Look! How did he get up on stage?
01:24:16.676,01:24:18.928,"I don't know, but when he gets down, we're gonna nail him."
01:24:19.012,01:24:21.431,How the hell did he change his clothes so fast?
01:24:24.100,01:24:26.227,"All right, guys, listen, this is a blues riff in B."
01:24:26.311,01:24:29.647,"Watch me for the changes, and try and keep up, okay?"
01:24:35.111,01:24:37.697,"-Doc. Doc, come in! -Marty, come in."
01:24:37.781,01:24:41.409,"Listen, Biff's guys chased me into the gym, and they're going to jump..."
01:24:41.493,01:24:42.327,me.
01:24:42.410,01:24:43.828,Then get out of there!
01:24:43.912,01:24:45.872,"No, Doc, not me. The other me."
01:24:45.955,01:24:48.249,The one that's up on stage playing Johnny B. Goode.
01:24:48.333,01:24:53.254,"Great Scott! Your other self will miss the lightning bolt at the clock tower, you won't get back to the future, and we'll have a major paradox!"
01:24:53.338,01:24:55.256,"Wait, wait, wait. A paradox?"
01:24:55.340,01:24:57.675,You mean one of those things that can destroy the universe?
01:24:57.759,01:25:03.098,"Precisely. Marty, you have to stop those guys at all costs, but without being seen by your other self or your parents."
01:25:03.181,01:25:04.432,Ten-four.
01:25:05.767,01:25:07.102,What the hell?
01:25:10.814,01:25:12.315,-Where is he? -Who?
01:25:12.398,01:25:13.942,-Calvin Klein. -Who?
01:25:14.025,01:25:17.445,"-The guy with the hat, where is he? -Oh. He went that way."
01:25:17.529,01:25:21.282,I think he took your wallet. I think he took his wallet.
01:27:17.649,01:27:20.360,I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet.
01:27:21.444,01:27:23.154,But your kids are going to love it.
01:27:32.413,01:27:34.791,"Hey, Doc, success. Everything's cool."
01:27:38.127,01:27:39.754,I'll be there.
01:27:47.303,01:27:48.513,Lorraine.
01:27:48.596,01:27:52.016,"Marty, that was very interesting music."
01:27:56.312,01:27:59.440,"I hope you don't mind, but George asked if he could take me home."
01:28:02.902,01:28:04.737,"I have a feeling, too."
01:28:05.321,01:28:06.990,"Hey, butthead!"
01:28:07.907,01:28:10.827,You think that stupid disguise would get by me?
01:28:11.619,01:28:15.623,"Let's have it out. You and me, right now."
01:28:16.708,01:28:18.126,"No, thanks."
01:28:19.961,01:28:22.088,What's the matter?
01:28:22.171,01:28:24.173,Where are you going?
01:28:24.257,01:28:25.925,Are you chicken?
01:28:27.218,01:28:30.388,"That's it, isn't it? Nothing but a little chicken."
01:28:45.069,01:28:58.458,Nobody calls me What the hell?
01:29:00.585,01:29:02.420,You steal my stuff?
01:29:04.213,01:29:06.299,And this one's for my car!
01:29:35.995,01:29:39.499,Biff nailed me. He took the book. He drove away with it in his car.
01:29:39.582,01:29:41.709,"It's my fault, Doc. I should have got out of there sooner."
01:29:41.793,01:29:43.628,No time for that now. Which way did he go?
01:29:43.711,01:29:45.922,-East towards the River Road Tunnel. -Get in!
01:29:57.266,01:29:58.851,Yes!
01:29:58.935,01:30:00.394,"There he is, Doc!"
01:30:00.770,01:30:02.772,Let's land on him. We'll cripple his car.
01:30:02.855,01:30:04.774,"Marty, he's in a '46 Ford. We're a DeLorean."
01:30:04.857,01:30:07.401,He'd rip through us like we were tin foil.
01:30:07.485,01:30:09.487,"-So, what do we do? -I have a plan."
01:30:11.739,01:30:14.283,a severe thunderstorm is heading for Hill Valley.
01:30:36.681,01:30:41.978,"Serving Hill Valley and all of Hill County, you're tuned to KKHV, the voice of Hill Valley."
01:30:50.153,01:30:58.911,"Turning to community calendar, the Hill Valley Women's Club bake sale will be held tomorrow afternoon from 2:00 to 5:00 at the community center on Forest Road."
01:30:58.995,01:31:02.832,"For you sports fans out there, there was a lot of action today in college football."
01:31:02.915,01:31:05.001,Here's what happened to the top ten.
01:31:05.084,01:31:08.754,"UCLA narrowly defeated Washington, 19-17."
01:31:08.838,01:31:12.175,"Michigan State crushed Minnesota, 42-14."
01:31:12.258,01:31:14.969,"Ohio State beat Iowa, 20-10."
01:31:15.052,01:31:17.638,"-Michigan blanked Indiana, 30-0. -Shit."
01:31:17.722,01:31:20.850,"It was Notre Dame over North Carolina, -twenty-seven to seven. -Son of a bitch."
01:31:20.933,01:31:23.853,"Oklahoma ripped Iowa State, 52-0."
01:31:24.812,01:31:27.607,"West Virginia lost to Pittsburgh, 26-7."
01:31:27.982,01:31:30.985,"Texas A&amp;M over Rice, 20-10."
01:31:31.068,01:31:37.783,"Maryland defeated Clemson, 25-12, and it was Texas Christian over Texas, 47-20."
01:31:37.867,01:31:41.412,"Repeating tonight's earlier weather bulletin, a severe..."
01:31:46.500,01:31:47.793,Let it go!
01:31:50.588,01:31:51.797,Whoa!
01:31:55.176,01:31:57.178,Let go of the car!
01:33:32.982,01:33:34.525,Oh!
01:34:05.348,01:34:06.557,Whoa!
01:34:06.640,01:34:08.476,"Go, Doc!"
01:34:08.559,01:34:10.102,"Hold on, Marty!"
01:34:15.149,01:34:16.525,Shit!
01:34:23.366,01:34:24.408,Yes!
01:34:34.752,01:34:37.671,Manure! I hate manure!
01:35:02.071,01:35:04.698,"Doc, is everything all right? Over."
01:35:07.576,01:35:09.161,Much too turbulent to make a landing from this direction.
01:35:09.245,01:35:11.622,I'll have to circle around and make a long approach from the south.
01:35:11.705,01:35:14.250,Have you got the book?
01:35:14.333,01:35:16.919,"In my hand, Doc! I got it in my hand!"
01:35:17.002,01:35:18.838,Burn it!
01:35:18.921,01:35:20.172,Check!
01:36:15.603,01:36:18.564,Doc! Doc! That newspaper changed.
01:36:18.647,01:36:20.316,"Doc, my father's alive!"
01:36:20.399,01:36:23.277,"That means everything's back to normal, right?"
01:36:26.989,01:36:28.657,Mission accomplished.
01:36:29.283,01:36:31.869,"That means Jennifer's okay and Einie's okay, right?"
01:36:31.952,01:36:35.080,"That's right, Marty. It's the ripple effect."
01:36:35.164,01:36:37.208,"The future is back, so let's go home."
01:36:37.291,01:36:48.177,"Right, Doc. Let's get our asses back to the fut-- Doc, Doc, are you okay?"
01:36:55.059,01:36:58.812,"Well, be careful. You don't want to get struck by lightning."
01:37:13.077,01:37:14.203,Doc.
01:37:23.170,01:37:24.255,Doc?
01:37:25.422,01:37:27.132,"Doc, come in, Doc."
01:37:28.801,01:37:30.636,"Doc, do you read me?"
01:37:31.595,01:37:34.974,"Do you read me, Doc? Come in. Doc."
01:37:47.945,01:37:49.154,"Oh, no."
01:37:57.746,01:37:59.206,He's gone.
01:38:01.250,01:38:02.918,The doc's gone.
01:38:25.774,01:38:27.151,Mr. McFly?
01:38:27.901,01:38:28.944,Huh?
01:38:31.780,01:38:34.283,Is your name Marty McFly?
01:38:39.246,01:38:40.247,Yeah.
01:38:42.583,01:38:44.543,I've got something for you.
01:38:46.962,01:38:47.921,A letter.
01:38:49.882,01:38:51.592,A letter for me?
01:38:52.718,01:38:54.345,That's impossible.
01:38:55.929,01:38:58.349,-Who the hell are you? -Western Union.
01:38:58.974,01:39:03.729,"Actually, a bunch of us at the office were kind of hoping maybe you could shed some light on the subject."
01:39:03.812,01:39:08.317,"See, we've had that envelope in our possession for the past 70 years."
01:39:11.320,01:39:27.086,"It was given to us with the explicit instructions that it be delivered to a young man with your description answering to the name of Marty at this exact location at this exact minute, November 12th, 1955."
01:39:27.670,01:39:30.881,We have a little bet going as to whether this Marty would actually be here.
01:39:33.634,01:39:35.135,Did you say 70 years?
01:39:35.219,01:39:38.138,"Yeah, 70 years, two months, uh, 12 days, to be exact."
01:39:38.222,01:39:39.890,"Here, sign on line six, please."
01:39:39.973,01:39:41.308,Here you are.
01:39:51.735,01:39:54.071,It's from the doc!
01:39:57.908,01:40:04.665,"Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning."
01:40:05.499,01:40:08.502,"First, let me assure you that I'm alive and well."
01:40:08.585,01:40:12.047,I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885.
01:40:12.131,01:40:13.674,The lightning bolt that...
01:40:13.757,01:40:15.008,1885!
01:40:15.676,01:40:17.219,"September, 1885."
01:40:18.053,01:40:21.473,"Wait, wait, kid! Wait a minute. What's this all about?"
01:40:21.557,01:40:24.393,He's alive! The doc's alive!
01:40:25.102,01:40:28.897,"-He's in the Old West, but he's alive. -Yeah, but, kid, you all right?"
01:40:29.356,01:40:30.566,Do you need any help?
01:40:31.275,01:40:33.402,There's only one man who can help me.
01:40:45.748,01:40:47.791,Whoa!
01:41:48.811,01:41:50.521,Doc! Doc! Doc!
01:41:51.313,01:41:53.148,-Doc! Doc! -What?
01:41:54.983,01:41:57.277,"Okay, relax, Doc. It's me. It's me! It's Marty."
01:41:57.361,01:41:59.905,"No, it can't be. I just sent you back to the future."
01:41:59.988,01:42:00.823,"Yeah. No, I know."
01:42:00.906,01:42:03.158,"You did send me back to the future, but I'm back."
01:42:03.242,01:42:05.369,I'm back from the future.
01:42:08.497,01:42:10.123,Great Scott!
01:42:12.251,01:42:15.295,Doc! Doc. Doc.
01:42:16.338,01:42:18.340,"Oh, fantastic."
01:42:36.441,01:42:37.734,"Hey, McFly."
01:42:45.868,01:42:47.786,"Just try it, Tannen!"
01:42:49.329,01:42:51.164,You can dance better than that!
