00:01:49.359,00:01:51.903,"You moved to the west side, you'd lose."
00:01:58.827,00:02:01.788,"Speaking of movements, I forgot to congratulate you on Mr. Leung's promotion."
00:02:02.372,00:02:04.499,What kind of promotion is that? He's in charge of rice.
00:02:05.416,00:02:07.418,It's hard to even get someone to buy rice from India.
00:02:07.502,00:02:10.004,That's better than being in charge of the treasury.
00:02:10.088,00:02:11.673,It's good if you listen to Mrs. Yee.
00:02:11.756,00:02:14.217,Me? I'm no savior.
00:02:14.300,00:02:16.302,Mr. Ma should have listened to me.
00:02:16.386,00:02:17.929,He became in charge of transportation.
00:02:18.012,00:02:20.473,"Now, he's often away and lets you run wild."
00:02:20.557,00:02:21.975,I've got my hands full.
00:02:22.058,00:02:25.228,His relatives kept coming to stay with us. My halls are crammed.
00:02:25.311,00:02:26.146,Mine.
00:02:26.229,00:02:29.482,"Not only do I have to find them jobs, but I even have to feed them."
00:02:29.566,00:02:32.026,I don't even get paid for doing all that.
00:02:32.110,00:02:33.069,Right.
00:02:33.695,00:02:35.488,Let's not give Mrs. Mak the wrong impression.
00:02:35.572,00:02:38.950,She'd think the Wang government's positions are appointed by us while playing mahjong.
00:02:39.868,00:02:41.202,Isn't that so?
00:02:41.870,00:02:45.832,The Japanese would never imagine that the officials are henpecked by their wives.
00:02:48.877,00:02:50.795,Eat while the food is still hot.
00:02:51.588,00:02:54.132,I really shouldn't eat. I'm so fat already.
00:02:54.632,00:02:56.426,Everybody is hoarding these days.
00:02:56.509,00:02:58.678,All we can do is hoard fat on our bodies.
00:02:59.304,00:03:01.139,"What should we hoard these days, Mrs. Yee?"
00:03:01.222,00:03:03.308,You know my husband is an importer.
00:03:03.391,00:03:04.225,Pong.
00:03:04.309,00:03:08.104,"Even though Hong Kong has fallen, ships must still come into port."
00:03:08.187,00:03:09.355,Mine.
00:03:11.482,00:03:12.358,Western medicine.
00:03:12.901,00:03:14.694,The last shipment sold out quickly.
00:03:14.777,00:03:16.321,Tell him to get more.
00:03:20.366,00:03:22.535,I heard you all went to Shuyu yesterday.
00:03:22.619,00:03:26.039,"Yes, a bunch of us. Mrs. Mak has never been there."
00:03:26.122,00:03:27.916,Everyone laughed when I told them that.
00:03:28.666,00:03:30.668,They've already opened two branches in Hong Kong.
00:03:30.752,00:03:33.546,The chefs from Sichuan and Hong Kong can't get along. It doesn't work.
00:03:34.088,00:03:36.257,"People from Hong Kong aren't used to spicy food, right?"
00:03:37.050,00:03:38.968,"It was really spicy yesterday, wasn't it?"
00:03:40.261,00:03:43.890,Very spicy. So spicy that I… Nine of Characters.
00:03:47.810,00:03:48.978,Two of Characters.
00:03:49.687,00:03:50.813,Pong.
00:03:54.734,00:03:56.027,"Mrs. Ma, you didn't go yesterday?"
00:03:56.110,00:03:58.529,RED DRAGON She hasn't been here for days.
00:03:58.613,00:03:59.572,I was tied up at home.
00:03:59.656,00:04:01.824,"You have a guest, so I didn't come for a couple of days."
00:04:01.908,00:04:04.410,"You can't get out of treating us as promised, so you went hiding."
00:04:05.370,00:04:08.122,Who was busy when I called a few days ago?
00:04:08.206,00:04:09.332,That doesn't count.
00:04:09.415,00:04:11.459,I went to pick up Mrs. Mak. You can ask her.
00:04:11.542,00:04:14.170,Mrs. Ma deliberately chose the day I had to pick you up to treat us.
00:04:14.254,00:04:15.129,She did it on purpose.
00:04:16.756,00:04:17.757,Pong.
00:04:25.098,00:04:26.849,Did you bring more stockings?
00:04:27.600,00:04:28.768,"Yes, but I gave them all away."
00:04:29.686,00:04:31.604,I'll bring more next time.
00:04:31.688,00:04:32.981,Sure.
00:04:33.064,00:04:35.066,Shanghai is short of everything these days.
00:04:35.149,00:04:36.901,Even toothpaste and soap are being sold illegally.
00:04:37.527,00:04:38.778,You should come more often.
00:04:38.861,00:04:40.989,You have a place to stay now.
00:04:56.796,00:04:57.922,He won't last much longer.
00:04:58.006,00:04:59.590,The Kenpeitai will surely take him.
00:05:00.591,00:05:02.468,They didn't say dead or alive.
00:05:02.552,00:05:03.803,Let him die a quick death.
00:05:04.846,00:05:06.931,What will you tell Mr. Miura?
00:05:07.015,00:05:09.600,They're investigating the arms the Americans provided to Chongqing.
00:05:10.518,00:05:12.186,I'll see him tonight.
00:05:12.270,00:05:14.564,His secretary called to cancel tonight's dinner.
00:05:15.064,00:05:17.734,He wants you to report to the Kenpeitai Headquarters tomorrow morning.
00:05:31.789,00:05:33.541,Won't you be returning to the office today?
00:05:33.624,00:05:34.959,I have another appointment.
00:05:35.835,00:05:36.961,Sir.
00:05:46.137,00:06:26.260,THE WORLD IS SHARED BY ALL She wanted a companion.
00:06:26.344,00:06:28.137,She bought it from Hong Kong.
00:06:28.221,00:06:31.557,She said it's my translation fee.
00:06:31.641,00:06:33.059,I was incredible.
00:06:34.227,00:06:36.896,My relative bought a diamond from a Russian.
00:06:36.979,00:06:38.981,A yellow one from an aristocrat.
00:06:39.565,00:06:41.734,The Russian aristocrats are begging on the streets.
00:06:41.818,00:06:43.194,Watch out for fakes.
00:06:43.277,00:06:45.029,I see you ladies started early today.
00:06:45.571,00:06:47.824,-Yes. -You're in luck today.
00:06:48.616,00:06:50.243,You've got Mr. Yee here rooting for you.
00:06:53.663,00:06:54.831,My turn?
00:06:56.124,00:06:57.041,Three of Characters.
00:06:57.125,00:06:58.459,Yours is nice.
00:06:59.043,00:07:02.088,How many carats is it? Three?
00:07:02.171,00:07:03.381,Is this nice?
00:07:03.464,00:07:05.925,But I think it's out of fashion.
00:07:06.008,00:07:07.718,I was planning to get it redesigned.
00:07:08.261,00:07:09.804,Pinfen came a few days ago.
00:07:09.887,00:07:11.222,She showed me a five-carat one.
00:07:11.806,00:07:14.142,"It was big, but not as bright as yours."
00:07:14.225,00:07:15.685,Pong.
00:07:15.768,00:07:17.228,Why didn't you call me?
00:07:17.311,00:07:19.188,I only had time for a quick look myself.
00:07:19.730,00:07:20.940,Pong.
00:07:21.023,00:07:23.151,Pinfen has things that others don't.
00:07:24.485,00:07:26.904,"She once had a premier diamond, but you wouldn't buy it for me."
00:07:27.905,00:07:29.449,Do you know how much that's worth now?
00:07:29.949,00:07:32.326,That premier diamond was over ten carats.
00:07:32.410,00:07:33.619,It's not a pigeon egg.
00:07:34.120,00:07:35.705,It's a stone after all.
00:07:35.788,00:07:37.915,"With that on your finger, you couldn't play mahjong."
00:07:40.209,00:07:42.336,You wouldn't buy it and you still give me an earful.
00:07:42.962,00:07:44.422,I win.
00:07:45.006,00:07:46.799,"Five sets, white dragon."
00:07:46.883,00:07:47.842,I'm one tile away.
00:07:47.925,00:07:50.261,"Mr. Yee, this is your fault for saying that about diamonds."
00:07:50.344,00:07:52.305,"-He's here to spoil our game. -Thank you, Mr. Yee."
00:07:52.388,00:07:54.307,This won't do. Mr. Yee better treat us to dinner.
00:07:54.390,00:07:56.392,No problem. Where would you like to go?
00:07:57.185,00:07:58.895,Shuyu.
00:07:58.978,00:08:00.813,"-You eat spicy food, right? -Let's not go there."
00:08:00.897,00:08:01.814,It's expensive.
00:08:06.986,00:08:08.738,"Gosh, look at me."
00:08:08.821,00:08:10.740,I'm supposed to meet someone at 3 p.m.
00:08:10.823,00:08:12.492,I completely forgot.
00:08:13.618,00:08:17.497,"This won't do, how can you do this? Why didn't you say so before?"
00:08:17.580,00:08:18.539,You're wicked.
00:08:19.081,00:08:20.541,I need to talk to that person.
00:08:21.125,00:08:22.251,I forgot. What should I do?
00:08:22.335,00:08:24.921,"Mr. Yee, please take my place first."
00:08:25.671,00:08:27.131,I'll be right back.
00:08:27.215,00:08:30.176,My luck just improved. Goodness.
00:08:30.259,00:08:33.012,Not today. I'm busy. I'll play with you all night next time.
00:08:33.095,00:08:34.931,"Mrs. Mak, you're so bad."
00:08:35.765,00:08:37.433,It's Mak's money.
00:08:37.517,00:08:40.645,"After all these years, we're finally getting part of it back."
00:08:41.354,00:08:43.105,Let's invite Mrs. Liao.
00:08:43.773,00:08:46.776,Mrs. Chen! Get Mrs. Liao on the phone.
00:08:46.859,00:08:48.819,-You're buying tonight. -Right.
00:09:18.724,00:09:21.978,"Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Yee said you can use her car."
00:09:22.061,00:09:23.271,It's waiting right outside.
00:09:24.480,00:09:25.982,How can I do that?
00:09:26.065,00:09:31.529,Isn't Mrs. Yee going to… All right then. Thank you.
00:09:31.612,00:09:32.697,I'll be right down.
00:09:57.388,00:09:59.932,There are so few cars here compared to Hong Kong.
00:10:00.016,00:10:01.475,Gas is expensive.
00:10:01.559,00:10:03.352,Even those who have cars don't drive anymore.
00:10:05.771,00:10:08.024,"Mrs. Mak, your Shanghainese is quite good."
00:10:09.775,00:10:11.485,My mom's from Shanghai.
00:10:11.569,00:10:15.072,We moved to Hong Kong when the war started.
00:10:15.573,00:10:16.532,Is that right?
00:10:24.457,00:10:25.416,Kneel!
00:10:27.960,00:10:29.754,Kneel!
00:10:30.963,00:10:33.549,-I told you to kneel! -Kneel!
00:10:35.468,00:10:36.510,Kneel!
00:10:43.184,00:10:46.854,These foreigners are only allowed to withdraw 20 yuan a day.
00:10:46.937,00:10:48.606,"So they settle for dry, hard bread."
00:11:06.582,00:11:07.625,Shall I come back for you?
00:11:07.708,00:11:09.001,"Don't bother, I'll get a cab."
00:12:49.727,00:12:51.312,That's odd. Did I dial the wrong number?
00:13:05.326,00:13:06.327,Hello?
00:13:06.827,00:13:08.829,"Hello? My second brother, it's me."
00:13:09.413,00:13:10.456,Yes.
00:13:14.001,00:13:16.170,I'm calling from Kiessling's Cafe.
00:13:16.253,00:13:17.838,Is everything okay at home?
00:13:18.672,00:13:19.798,Yes.
00:13:20.382,00:13:21.675,I'm doing good.
00:13:21.759,00:13:23.928,Just too busy to call home.
00:13:27.181,00:13:28.682,I'm planning to go shopping today.
00:13:28.766,00:13:30.643,I have an appointment. I'm going now.
00:13:31.352,00:13:32.394,Okay.
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.527,That's all.
00:13:41.195,00:13:42.780,All right. We're fine here.
00:13:43.531,00:13:45.658,I'll get going. Bye.
00:13:51.247,00:13:52.414,Make a move.
00:15:18.125,00:15:20.461,"After you defeat the Japanese, we'll marry you!"
00:15:23.005,00:15:24.590,I wasn't referring to myself.
00:15:24.673,00:15:27.468,"With all the men off to war, who'll be left for us to marry?"
00:15:27.551,00:15:30.471,Why do you say that? Go marry him then.
00:15:43.233,00:15:45.819,I heard the Japanese took over Guangzhou.
00:15:46.737,00:15:49.031,Do you think we'll be safer in Hong Kong?
00:15:49.657,00:15:52.368,I didn't expect us to rely on the British for protection.
00:15:53.410,00:15:54.912,Isn't your dad in England?
00:15:54.995,00:15:56.288,Why didn't he take you with him?
00:15:58.415,00:15:59.875,He took my little brother.
00:16:00.751,00:16:03.462,"After my mom died, he said he'd bring me there."
00:16:03.545,00:16:05.089,But the war broke out later on.
00:16:07.466,00:16:09.176,I'll never go back home.
00:16:09.259,00:16:11.845,War gave me the chance to go to Hong Kong.
00:16:11.929,00:16:14.181,"From there, I'll go overseas and see the world."
00:16:32.116,00:16:34.118,I'll meet you this evening by the pond.
00:16:34.201,00:16:35.536,Let's go home together.
00:16:35.619,00:16:36.954,Okay.
00:16:37.037,00:16:38.080,Lai Shujin!
00:16:43.585,00:16:44.753,I was hoping to run into you.
00:16:44.837,00:16:47.589,"Kuang Yumin, not bad. You remember me."
00:16:47.673,00:16:51.427,I do. I saw you perform for the Women's Drama Club at Lingnan University.
00:16:51.510,00:16:52.970,We started a new drama club.
00:16:53.053,00:16:55.264,We're holding the auditions tomorrow afternoon.
00:16:56.140,00:16:59.727,But the Women's Drama Club has never acted with men.
00:16:59.810,00:17:02.062,We just borrow classrooms here at the Hong Kong University.
00:17:02.146,00:17:04.231,There are very few of us. We must work together.
00:17:05.899,00:17:07.901,Then let's perform lbsen's A Doll's House.
00:17:07.985,00:17:09.820,I know Nora's lines inside out.
00:17:09.903,00:17:14.199,"In times like these, who would be in the mood for that kind of bourgeois drama?"
00:17:14.283,00:17:17.536,We're planning to do a patriotic play to raise money for the resistance.
00:17:18.495,00:17:20.122,You can audition too.
00:17:22.708,00:17:25.294,But I'm only a freshman. I've never acted before.
00:17:25.377,00:17:26.420,So what?
00:17:26.503,00:17:29.048,We must all pitch in for the resistance.
00:17:29.131,00:17:34.219,Our soldiers are fighting for their lives at the frontlines while people in Hong Kong continue their leisure life.
00:17:34.303,00:17:36.638,We have to wake them up with our drums and gongs.
00:17:40.976,00:17:43.187,What a typical director. He never listens to anyone else.
00:17:44.480,00:17:45.773,But he mentioned the resistance.
00:17:45.856,00:17:47.066,Women should help too.
00:17:49.026,00:17:53.989,But when I think about letting him have his way… He seems very passionate.
00:17:56.241,00:18:01.121,"His brother died from the war shortly after graduating from military school, so his parents forbade him from joining the army."
00:18:01.705,00:18:02.998,That's why he's so worked up.
00:18:06.085,00:18:07.795,I don't want him to join either.
00:18:11.173,00:18:15.219,"I go back to the land that nurtured me, -my soul will soon return. -A bit to the left."
00:18:16.136,00:18:18.347,-A little bit more. -Is this okay?
00:18:18.430,00:18:20.474,Good. That's it.
00:18:21.517,00:18:23.268,-One more time. -Try it.
00:18:40.202,00:18:58.095,WITH MS. LINDA… What's the matter?
00:18:59.763,00:19:01.056,My dad remarried.
00:19:01.849,00:19:04.059,I'm writing him a congratulatory letter.
00:20:01.074,00:20:03.410,Your stage fright will be gone after we get started.
00:20:51.208,00:20:52.209,Mrs. Zhao!
00:20:55.671,00:20:57.881,They found this soldier behind the hills.
00:20:57.965,00:20:59.967,"Xiaohong, is your brother home?"
00:21:01.051,00:21:02.761,-Come inside. -Be careful.
00:21:02.844,00:21:04.554,-My son! -Be careful.
00:21:04.638,00:21:06.306,Go boil some water!
00:21:06.390,00:21:09.559,-Be careful. -How did you get hurt this way? Gosh!
00:21:09.643,00:21:12.145,"He's a soldier, not your son!"
00:21:15.565,00:21:17.901,My son is coming home tonight.
00:21:18.694,00:21:19.695,He'll be home for dinner.
00:21:19.778,00:21:22.406,Let me kill a chicken to nourish him.
00:21:22.489,00:21:24.533,My son is coming home.
00:21:24.616,00:21:26.743,He is coming home today!
00:21:27.536,00:21:29.538,My son is coming home.
00:21:31.290,00:21:33.125,My son is coming home.
00:21:35.210,00:21:40.757,"Since my mom found out my brother died at the frontlines, she has been sick."
00:21:42.759,00:21:46.179,I just finished knitting this for my brother.
00:21:46.263,00:21:49.725,But he won't get to use it anymore.
00:21:52.227,00:21:53.687,Please take it.
00:21:53.770,00:21:55.147,I can't.
00:21:55.230,00:21:57.524,You saved my life and I can't repay you for it.
00:21:57.607,00:21:59.151,You've repaid me by saving the country!
00:21:59.234,00:22:01.653,You've avenged my brother by killing our enemy!
00:22:02.946,00:22:05.115,It's a shame that I am a girl.
00:22:05.699,00:22:08.493,"My mom's sick, I must take care of her."
00:22:10.704,00:22:12.456,I promised my brother.
00:22:13.165,00:22:14.624,I must let him rest in peace.
00:22:16.710,00:22:24.217,Your brother… He was the same age as you.
00:22:25.552,00:22:30.348,"Since my dad died, he has supported our family."
00:22:31.016,00:22:33.226,He works harder than anyone.
00:22:33.310,00:22:37.397,"During harvest time, he always helped others after he was done."
00:22:39.316,00:22:41.777,He was well-built like you.
00:22:44.279,00:22:47.866,I followed him around everywhere.
00:22:49.201,00:22:55.040,He often said that heaven would protect honest folks.
00:22:56.792,00:23:01.338,He was our family's only hope!
00:23:04.925,00:23:06.593,Let me kowtow!
00:23:07.219,00:23:12.724,"For our country, for my dead brother, and for our people for generations to come!"
00:23:12.808,00:23:15.185,China cannot fall!
00:23:16.144,00:23:20.816,-China cannot fall! -China cannot fall!
00:23:27.572,00:23:29.616,-China cannot fall! -China cannot fall!
00:23:29.699,00:23:33.703,-China cannot fall! -China cannot fall!
00:23:36.498,00:23:40.669,-Here. Cheers! -Cheers!
00:23:42.754,00:23:44.464,We must really celebrate.
00:23:44.548,00:23:45.674,That was amazing.
00:23:45.757,00:23:48.510,"Over 1,000 people were shouting, China cannot fall!"
00:23:48.593,00:23:51.304,China cannot fall!
00:23:51.388,00:23:53.014,-China cannot fall! -What are you doing?
00:23:53.098,00:23:55.267,-Here he goes again. -Look at him.
00:23:55.350,00:23:58.478,Six hundred seats plus those standing in the aisles.
00:23:58.562,00:24:00.647,Don't underestimate the people in Hong Kong.
00:24:00.730,00:24:01.648,True.
00:24:01.731,00:24:04.359,Our audience at Lingnan University were never this excited.
00:24:04.943,00:24:07.028,We're telling a story about what's happening.
00:24:07.821,00:24:10.532,"The audience can relate, so they were moved."
00:24:11.116,00:24:14.119,"At the donation table, I saw many people still drying their eyes."
00:24:16.371,00:24:17.581,A toast to all of you.
00:24:17.664,00:24:20.458,We've finally raised some donations to contribute to the cause.
00:24:24.671,00:24:27.841,Let's drink tonight and worry about the country tomorrow.
00:24:27.924,00:24:29.634,Yumin! Cheers!
00:24:29.718,00:24:31.344,-Cheers. -Cheers.
00:24:31.428,00:24:32.971,-Cheers. -Wait.
00:24:33.054,00:24:35.515,I have an idea. Listen to me. This is what we'll do.
00:24:35.599,00:24:39.895,We should sell the tickets and put up a sign that says Limited tickets only.
00:24:40.478,00:24:42.981,"But if they see you, it'll be hard to sell even one ticket."
00:24:44.149,00:24:45.358,Give me the bottle.
00:24:45.442,00:24:46.359,Be careful.
00:24:47.194,00:24:49.154,A toast to our leading lady.
00:24:49.237,00:24:50.989,We need her to sell the tickets.
00:24:51.072,00:24:53.450,"-Leading lady, cheers! -Cheers!"
00:24:53.533,00:24:54.951,-Here. Cheers! -Cheers!
00:24:55.035,00:24:56.620,No. I'm not.
00:24:56.703,00:24:58.622,-No. I'm not! -Cheers!
00:24:58.705,00:25:31.029,"-Students in sweet youth today -Students in sweet youth today -Pillars of society tomorrow -Pillars of society tomorrow -Today, we fill this hall with songs -Today, we fill this hall with songs -Tomorrow, we make waves -Tomorrow, we make waves -To save our nation -To save our nation -Huge waves, huge waves, forever surging -Huge waves, huge waves, forever surging -Fellow students -Fellow students Come forward with all your strength Take our land's fate into our hands Huge waves, huge waves Hurry!"
00:25:31.112,00:25:33.073,-Hurry! -Come on!
00:25:33.156,00:25:34.866,Come up.
00:25:36.618,00:25:39.204,-Come on. -Let's sit at the back.
00:25:42.499,00:25:43.500,Is it lit?
00:25:59.099,00:26:01.518,Artists have to smoke. Try it.
00:26:02.435,00:26:03.853,It comes in handy on stage.
00:26:09.150,00:26:11.111,-Wong Chiachi took a smoke. -Give it to me.
00:26:11.194,00:26:13.280,-Me. Give it to me. -What are you doing?
00:26:14.406,00:26:16.992,-Give it to me. -Give it to me.
00:26:17.075,00:26:18.034,Give it to me.
00:26:19.077,00:26:21.121,-Give it to me. -Give it to me.
00:26:21.621,00:26:25.333,-Let me smoke. -Let me smoke. Come on.
00:26:26.167,00:26:28.336,-That's enough. -All right.
00:26:47.355,00:26:48.189,I'm not sure.
00:26:56.614,00:26:58.033,-Hey. -Hey.
00:27:06.541,00:27:07.542,Thank you.
00:27:09.085,00:27:10.128,For what?
00:27:56.007,00:27:57.050,Wong Chiachi.
00:27:59.844,00:28:00.720,Come on up.
00:28:05.934,00:28:09.687,"The other day, I ran into a guy called Cao Dexi from my hometown."
00:28:09.771,00:28:12.482,He used to hang around with my brother in school. We know each other.
00:28:13.066,00:28:16.361,I heard he's an assistant of someone in the Peace Movement.
00:28:17.028,00:28:22.659,"His surname is Yee, a top agent of Wang Jingwei who's hiding in Hong Kong."
00:28:22.742,00:28:27.414,"They say Wang Jingwei is involved with the Peace Movement, but he's actually a lackey of the Japanese."
00:28:27.997,00:28:29.499,He's a traitor!
00:28:29.582,00:28:31.292,Wang is recruiting men for the Japanese.
00:28:31.376,00:28:33.336,I heard that Yee is in charge of doing that in HK.
00:28:34.045,00:28:35.338,I was lucky to bump into Cao.
00:28:40.135,00:28:41.511,This is an opportunity for us.
00:28:43.513,00:28:44.806,An opportunity for what?
00:28:46.266,00:28:48.017,I'm not talking about acting in a play.
00:28:49.477,00:28:55.483,Wrenching tears from an audience and yelling until your voice is hoarse can't compare with killing a true traitor.
00:28:56.443,00:28:58.445,Summer break is coming. The school wouldn't find out.
00:28:59.237,00:29:02.282,It's better if we can disguise ourselves and infiltrate Yee's household.
00:29:03.283,00:29:06.411,"I'll use my relationship with Cao, maybe he'll give us a job or something."
00:29:06.953,00:29:11.082,Then we must get some guns… But what do we know about killing people?
00:29:11.166,00:29:12.876,Our only experience is on stage.
00:29:12.959,00:29:18.214,"When you are faced with a real traitor, one who betrays his own people, killing won't be hard at all."
00:29:18.298,00:29:20.383,We'll only worry about not killing enough!
00:29:21.009,00:29:23.511,"You'll be risking your lives, so think about it carefully."
00:29:24.095,00:29:26.306,"If we do it, we do it big!"
00:29:27.682,00:29:30.685,"If we die, we won't have any regrets."
00:29:31.519,00:29:33.438,Let's kill one of Wang Jingwei's lapdogs!
00:29:34.439,00:29:35.273,I'm in.
00:29:36.191,00:29:37.192,Me too.
00:29:43.239,00:29:49.162,Of course we are… I'm not forcing anyone to join.
00:29:51.539,00:29:53.082,I'm willing to join you.
00:29:59.798,00:30:00.673,-Get rich. -Get rich.
00:30:00.757,00:30:05.512,"-Things will go smoothly, I got it. -Treasure, gold, money, I got it all!"
00:30:05.595,00:30:07.514,I know how annoying you are.
00:30:07.597,00:30:10.099,-Drink. -Let's drink.
00:30:13.394,00:30:17.524,"Yumin, I didn't expect you to come and find me."
00:30:18.983,00:30:21.528,It's so great to meet again after all these years away from home.
00:30:22.862,00:30:24.364,Enough talking. Let's drink first.
00:30:24.447,00:30:26.366,-Let's drink. -Let's drink.
00:30:26.449,00:30:27.492,Bottoms up.
00:30:31.663,00:30:33.289,A toast to Mr. Cao.
00:30:34.290,00:30:36.000,Please take care of us going forward.
00:30:36.084,00:30:37.335,Okay.
00:30:37.418,00:30:38.545,Here's to you.
00:30:39.295,00:30:44.467,"Mr. Cao, see if there's an opportunity for me."
00:30:45.343,00:30:47.220,Can you find a job for me?
00:30:48.555,00:30:49.806,It's a tough job.
00:30:51.391,00:30:54.352,"But all right, I'll look into it."
00:31:05.864,00:31:07.740,-Where's Lang Junsheng? -He's still up there.
00:31:08.366,00:31:09.993,What is he still doing there?
00:31:10.076,00:31:12.245,We only have enough to pay for that guy Cao.
00:31:13.162,00:31:14.706,Maybe he can get more information.
00:31:16.291,00:31:18.209,With just a few drinks?
00:31:37.395,00:31:40.189,The foreigners have left for the summer.
00:31:40.273,00:31:42.400,We can rent the second floor for a couple of months.
00:31:56.539,00:31:57.874,Where did you get the money?
00:31:58.416,00:32:02.253,My old man gave me some money in Hong Kong for me to use in case of emergencies.
00:32:02.337,00:32:04.172,Do we need such a posh place?
00:32:04.255,00:32:08.718,"You want Auyang to be Mr. Mak, a businessman, and Wong Chiachi to be his rich wife."
00:32:08.801,00:32:10.803,They must live in a place like this.
00:32:10.887,00:32:14.557,Let's decorate it. Get some furniture and a maid.
00:32:14.641,00:32:16.851,Does Mr. Mak need a goatee?
00:32:28.613,00:32:29.447,Wait a moment.
00:32:48.049,00:32:50.593,Don't wipe your mouth with it. It's my best tie.
00:32:50.677,00:32:52.762,This is not a rehearsal. There are no second chances.
00:32:53.304,00:32:55.098,Remember your role before you speak.
00:32:55.181,00:32:57.725,"Don't say what you're not supposed to. Less words, less mistakes."
00:32:59.978,00:33:01.145,You too.
00:33:04.732,00:33:05.650,Here they come.
00:33:27.088,00:33:28.381,"Mr. Mak, Mrs. Mak."
00:33:29.549,00:33:32.927,"He is Mr. Mak's cousin from my hometown, Kuang Yumin."
00:33:33.011,00:33:34.262,Okay.
00:33:34.345,00:33:36.347,This is Mr. Yee and Mrs. Yee.
00:33:49.777,00:33:52.196,Go and have fun. Please excuse me.
00:33:56.993,00:34:00.246,"I'm sorry, you even came to pick me up."
00:34:00.955,00:34:04.917,"Cao said that you know Hong Kong well, otherwise, we could have used my husband's car."
00:34:05.001,00:34:06.586,"It's fine, it's on our way."
00:34:07.253,00:34:09.213,"Mrs. Yee, you'd like to shop around Central, right?"
00:34:10.173,00:34:14.052,I've been in Hong Kong for a few months and all I know is Central and Repulse Bay.
00:34:14.886,00:34:15.970,It's embarrassing.
00:34:16.054,00:34:18.389,Then let's go to Tsim Sha Tsui.
00:34:19.182,00:34:20.683,We can shop there.
00:34:20.767,00:34:21.642,Sure.
00:34:22.852,00:34:24.645,"To Tsim Sha Tsui, Queen's Harbor."
00:34:24.729,00:34:25.813,Okay.
00:34:37.200,00:34:39.452,"Drop us first, then go to your office."
00:34:39.535,00:34:40.995,"You can be a little late, right?"
00:34:42.413,00:34:44.499,We must not keep Mr. Mak from his work.
00:34:45.083,00:34:46.834,It's his family's business. It's fine.
00:34:48.294,00:34:52.256,"Mr. Mak, what is your line of business?"
00:34:52.340,00:34:53.341,Export trading.
00:34:55.843,00:34:57.345,As well as import.
00:35:00.014,00:35:02.391,"Mrs. Yee, this is such a nice area."
00:35:03.059,00:35:05.103,We didn't see it when we were looking.
00:35:06.145,00:35:07.396,We're only renting.
00:35:07.480,00:35:10.441,"When the war broke out on the Mainland, we had to move here in a hurry."
00:35:14.070,00:35:17.406,"Mrs. Mak, are you a native of Hong Kong?"
00:35:18.366,00:35:19.784,I came here after I got married.
00:35:20.493,00:35:22.370,My hometown is in Canton.
00:35:22.453,00:35:23.704,My mom is from Shanghai.
00:35:24.455,00:35:26.666,Then you must know the Shanghai dialect.
00:35:27.250,00:35:29.001,"Yes, but not well."
00:35:29.085,00:35:30.169,I've forgotten most of it.
00:35:31.754,00:35:33.464,I was originally from Anhui province.
00:35:33.548,00:35:35.633,My Shanghainese is so-so too.
00:35:55.611,00:35:56.487,Thank you.
00:35:57.071,00:35:59.073,I'm sorry to make you carry my things.
00:35:59.615,00:36:01.450,It's nothing. My pleasure.
00:36:01.534,00:36:03.202,He's our cousin. It's fine.
00:36:03.286,00:36:04.579,He's also new in Hong Kong.
00:36:04.662,00:36:07.165,We brought him along for sightseeing.
00:36:11.502,00:36:14.422,What did you do in Canton?
00:36:15.381,00:36:18.509,I was a teacher in an elementary school in the suburbs.
00:36:19.177,00:36:20.386,No wonder.
00:36:20.469,00:36:24.390,I thought you looked educated and were either a college student or a teacher.
00:36:24.891,00:36:27.059,"Yes. Mrs. Yee, you're so observant!"
00:36:29.103,00:36:31.606,Didn't you see all his plainclothes security by the gate?
00:36:31.689,00:36:33.649,There's no way to kill him at his home.
00:36:33.733,00:36:36.277,"When he goes out, he has a driver and at least one guard with him."
00:36:36.360,00:36:38.696,"Even if we lure him out, we have to deal with three people."
00:36:38.779,00:36:40.281,We'll need at least two guns.
00:36:40.364,00:36:42.450,That's still better than trying it at his home.
00:36:43.034,00:36:45.870,We must be patient. We've made contact already.
00:36:47.455,00:36:49.457,Mrs. Yee has a good impression of Wong Chiachi.
00:36:49.540,00:36:51.375,They've already agreed to meet again.
00:36:53.127,00:36:54.837,Excuse me. I'm tired.
00:37:12.521,00:37:14.190,-Can I come in? -Nice.
00:37:14.690,00:37:15.524,-Come in. -Move a bit.
00:37:15.608,00:37:19.362,-Come and see. -I haven't seen it before.
00:37:25.201,00:37:26.410,I rushed the tailor.
00:37:29.163,00:37:30.039,Thanks.
00:38:02.738,00:38:04.782,"This Yee guy, what does he look like?"
00:38:06.784,00:38:11.122,I only caught a glimpse. He's not what I imagined.
00:38:24.093,00:38:26.095,The cook just disappeared on us.
00:38:26.178,00:38:29.640,He didn't steal anything. He just disappeared.
00:38:30.683,00:38:33.811,That's why we moved to the Peninsula. It has been five days.
00:38:34.353,00:38:35.604,We don't dare to go back.
00:38:36.147,00:38:39.608,My husband said it's not safe and we need to find another home.
00:38:40.359,00:38:41.777,You can't trust any of them here.
00:38:41.861,00:38:44.530,"These Cantonese people, I don't understand a word they say."
00:38:44.613,00:38:46.991,Right. I'm worried.
00:38:47.074,00:38:51.203,Where can I find a chef who can cook decent Shanghai dishes?
00:38:52.288,00:38:55.541,I know a restaurant in Hong Kong with great Shanghai cuisine.
00:38:55.624,00:38:57.793,The scallion carp and drunken chicken are good.
00:38:58.377,00:39:00.171,You must take us there.
00:39:00.921,00:39:05.634,"Yee, Mrs. Mak was just telling us about a great Shanghai restaurant here."
00:39:05.718,00:39:07.011,He's the real picky one.
00:39:07.094,00:39:09.180,Not even the best restaurant can satisfy him.
00:39:09.263,00:39:11.015,Really? Which one?
00:39:11.724,00:39:14.518,Zhujia Restaurant. It's in Kowloon.
00:39:14.602,00:39:17.146,It's owned by the main chef from Tang's in Shanghai.
00:39:19.065,00:39:20.274,I think I've heard of it.
00:39:21.359,00:39:22.568,I will be out late tonight.
00:39:23.277,00:39:25.154,"Don't forget, we're entertaining guests tomorrow."
00:39:26.739,00:39:27.782,Good night.
00:39:31.160,00:39:33.579,You're entertaining people? Why aren't we invited?
00:39:34.080,00:39:35.831,He won't even tell me who it is.
00:39:36.415,00:39:38.959,"It must be Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun."
00:39:40.252,00:39:41.837,They want to set up a new government.
00:39:41.921,00:39:43.631,My husband has also been approached.
00:39:44.507,00:39:47.635,That means Mr. Yee is going to be promoted.
00:39:55.684,00:39:56.769,I told you!
00:40:13.619,00:40:14.537,Why are you so late?
00:40:14.620,00:40:15.955,We played mahjong.
00:40:16.038,00:40:17.289,"I'm sorry, I lost again."
00:40:17.915,00:40:18.874,Was Yee there?
00:40:20.334,00:40:21.752,For a minute.
00:40:21.836,00:40:23.504,But he left and never came back.
00:40:24.422,00:40:25.631,-Shujin. -Hey.
00:40:26.173,00:40:28.342,Get off. I'm exhausted.
00:40:48.404,00:40:49.738,I hit a bottle.
00:40:50.781,00:40:51.866,You're good.
00:40:52.658,00:40:55.327,It's been a month and you're excited about hitting one or two bottles.
00:40:55.411,00:40:58.873,Why don't you just kill me and save my old man the trouble!
00:40:58.956,00:41:03.127,"The apartment, car, mahjong, shopping, buying high-class products, and even your whores!"
00:41:03.210,00:41:04.962,Are we killing traitors or having a vacation?
00:41:05.045,00:41:06.088,How many dads do I have?
00:41:06.172,00:41:09.008,Wong Chiachi needs fancy jewelry and you play the resistance hero.
00:41:09.091,00:41:09.967,What about me?
00:41:10.050,00:41:12.136,I drive during the day and even stand guard at night!
00:41:12.219,00:41:16.223,"My dad's investigating me, thinking I've been involved with a whore!"
00:41:16.307,00:41:17.933,He wants to disown me!
00:41:18.017,00:41:19.518,You guys figure it out yourselves!
00:41:21.145,00:41:22.104,We've got guns.
00:41:22.188,00:41:24.106,Why don't we shoot a couple of easy targets?
00:41:24.190,00:41:25.733,"Otherwise, school is about to start."
00:41:27.151,00:41:28.861,We all joined freely.
00:41:28.944,00:41:31.155,Why are you blaming Kuang Yumin?
00:41:31.238,00:41:32.573,I'm aware of the issue with money.
00:41:32.656,00:41:34.241,I should have foreseen the consequences.
00:41:34.825,00:41:36.118,I admit we're amateurs.
00:41:36.202,00:41:39.371,But we made a decision and finally got access to Yee's household.
00:41:39.455,00:41:40.915,Should we give up now?
00:41:41.707,00:41:43.542,I know the guards now.
00:41:43.626,00:41:46.253,I'll find a chance to make a move and face the consequences.
00:41:46.337,00:41:47.171,Don't be stupid.
00:41:47.254,00:41:48.797,How can you get to Yee by yourself?
00:41:48.881,00:41:49.798,That's my business.
00:41:49.882,00:41:50.841,That's enough.
00:42:00.893,00:42:02.645,The papers are in the study.
00:42:08.359,00:42:09.276,Mr. Yee.
00:42:09.360,00:42:10.236,Mrs. Mak.
00:42:11.654,00:42:13.906,My car broke down halfway and it rained.
00:42:18.827,00:42:20.079,Take Mrs. Mak inside.
00:42:31.799,00:42:33.384,Hong Kong is so humid.
00:42:33.467,00:42:35.511,You can squeeze out water just by making a fist.
00:42:35.594,00:42:38.013,"Right, Shanghai isn't this way."
00:42:38.097,00:42:40.224,"After all these years, I'm still not used to it here."
00:42:41.308,00:42:42.893,"Hey, Mrs. Hsiao."
00:42:42.977,00:42:45.187,I thought you wouldn't come because of the typhoon.
00:42:46.939,00:42:48.190,Why are you back?
00:42:48.732,00:42:50.442,My appointment was canceled due to the rain.
00:42:51.652,00:42:53.696,"Mrs. Mak, Mrs. Chu, you're here."
00:42:53.779,00:42:55.072,We were waiting for Mrs. Hsiao.
00:42:55.155,00:42:57.366,You are just in time. We need another player.
00:42:58.617,00:42:59.827,I have things to do.
00:42:59.910,00:43:01.870,"Come on, Yee. Just until Hsiao comes."
00:43:01.954,00:43:03.622,When was the last time you played?
00:43:03.706,00:43:06.250,"Mr. Yee, Mrs. Yee is getting mad."
00:43:10.004,00:43:10.921,All right.
00:43:19.597,00:43:20.764,Seven of Characters.
00:43:22.141,00:43:24.059,Mine. East wind.
00:43:25.519,00:43:27.646,Yee actually likes the fabric we got the other day.
00:43:27.730,00:43:29.273,But he's not happy with our tailor.
00:43:29.356,00:43:30.816,Do you know anyone good?
00:43:31.692,00:43:33.319,"Yes, there's one. He has good skills."
00:43:33.402,00:43:36.655,He does all our cheongsam and suits.
00:43:36.739,00:43:38.741,-South wind. -Pong.
00:43:40.701,00:43:42.661,Should we try him?
00:43:43.662,00:43:44.913,You decide.
00:43:47.249,00:43:48.375,Seven of Dots.
00:43:49.501,00:43:50.794,-Mine. -Pong.
00:43:53.172,00:43:54.214,But it's peak season now.
00:43:54.298,00:43:55.924,They're busy with the tourists.
00:43:57.092,00:43:58.761,"It's not going to take months, is it?"
00:43:58.844,00:44:01.055,No. I'm an old customer.
00:44:01.138,00:44:02.556,I can tell them to rush yours first.
00:44:03.349,00:44:04.308,Seven of Dots.
00:44:09.063,00:44:10.564,Mine. Nine of Dots.
00:44:11.607,00:44:12.983,This is what we'll do.
00:44:13.067,00:44:18.530,"When Mr. Yee is free, give me a call, Mrs. Yee."
00:44:19.156,00:44:20.824,Mrs. Mak. I have your number.
00:44:24.286,00:44:25.579,Eight of Dots.
00:44:26.747,00:44:27.665,Pong.
00:44:31.043,00:44:31.960,Four of Bamboos.
00:44:33.420,00:44:36.048,"In the upcoming sale, we can take a look at other fabrics."
00:44:38.008,00:44:39.259,Mr. Yee likes British imports.
00:44:39.343,00:44:40.928,Those never go on sale.
00:44:41.637,00:44:42.638,Is that so?
00:44:44.848,00:44:46.141,Six of Characters.
00:44:53.148,00:44:55.317,Does this mean I won?
00:45:05.577,00:45:07.788,You're lucky today.
00:45:09.164,00:45:11.583,I almost didn't know I won.
00:45:11.667,00:45:13.293,The god of fortune is with me today.
00:45:18.257,00:45:20.592,"Five, six, seven, eight."
00:45:20.676,00:45:22.511,Charge.
00:45:22.594,00:45:24.680,Charge. Spin.
00:45:29.518,00:45:30.811,Giddy up.
00:45:32.187,00:45:34.940,Spin. Your leg.
00:45:36.650,00:45:39.653,"Okay, again."
00:45:40.195,00:45:43.824,"Slow, quick, quick."
00:45:44.491,00:45:45.534,Please wait.
00:45:47.244,00:45:48.370,Mr. Yee.
00:45:49.705,00:45:51.415,I recognized your voice.
00:46:01.717,00:46:04.094,The collar can be a little more snug. It'd suit his face more.
00:46:05.179,00:46:07.681,Yes. It looks much better with a narrow collar.
00:46:10.392,00:46:11.727,Shorten the sleeves a bit.
00:46:14.897,00:46:18.066,"With shorter sleeves, it would make you look sharper."
00:46:18.150,00:46:19.818,You decide.
00:46:23.614,00:46:25.407,It's the latest look.
00:46:25.491,00:46:26.867,The collar is nice.
00:46:29.703,00:46:32.915,"Ma'am, we've made the alterations for your cheongsam. This way, please."
00:46:33.707,00:46:34.750,Let me try it on.
00:46:46.011,00:46:47.763,Go eat. Don't wait for me.
00:46:47.846,00:46:48.931,Okay.
00:46:59.316,00:47:01.443,Does Mrs. Mak often let you make her clothes?
00:47:04.154,00:47:04.988,Yes.
00:47:05.072,00:47:06.698,She has helped me out quite a bit.
00:47:24.299,00:47:27.261,It fits too well now. I can hardly breathe.
00:47:29.638,00:47:35.060,"Your wife picked this fabric first, but she thought it was a bit gaudy, so I took it for myself."
00:47:39.690,00:47:42.818,"Well, this is fine. Let me take it off."
00:47:42.901,00:47:43.777,Leave it on.
00:48:02.045,00:48:03.046,All right.
00:48:10.637,00:48:12.180,I hope Mrs. Yee is fine.
00:48:12.264,00:48:15.267,Cao has taken her to the doctor.
00:48:16.226,00:48:18.395,She complained of a headache when we were about to leave.
00:48:18.478,00:48:19.896,"All that mahjong, I guess."
00:48:21.273,00:48:24.067,My husband doesn't like me playing either. We always argue about it.
00:48:24.985,00:48:26.903,I told him men have endless distractions.
00:48:27.613,00:48:31.033,What about us? We only have shopping and mahjong.
00:48:31.116,00:48:33.577,Mahjong should be okay. We just stay indoors.
00:48:35.078,00:48:38.290,"When I called you today, was I interrupting anything?"
00:48:41.501,00:48:47.174,"My husband is away in Singapore, so his friends came over to keep me company."
00:48:48.550,00:48:50.385,"Actually, they're keeping an eye on me."
00:48:51.970,00:48:54.640,Your call gave me the perfect excuse to leave.
00:48:56.892,00:48:58.018,Is that so?
00:49:16.953,00:49:19.873,"Sometimes, I'd rather go out on my own when I'm free."
00:49:21.041,00:49:23.627,The things I like don't interest Mak.
00:49:25.087,00:49:26.254,What do you like?
00:49:26.755,00:49:27.714,Going to the movies.
00:49:28.298,00:49:30.550,"Mak won't go with me, so I usually go by myself."
00:49:31.343,00:49:33.470,He and his friends only talk business.
00:49:33.553,00:49:35.305,Nobody likes movies.
00:49:36.181,00:49:37.349,I don't watch movies either.
00:49:39.101,00:49:40.519,"Mr. Yee, you are too busy."
00:49:40.602,00:49:42.396,Movies are for people with time to kill.
00:49:43.188,00:49:45.732,It's not that. I don't like dark places.
00:49:52.614,00:49:53.740,Would you like a drink?
00:49:56.785,00:49:57.953,I'll drink a little with you.
00:49:59.871,00:50:02.916,"We know very few people in Hong Kong, so we're always troubling you."
00:50:03.875,00:50:06.503,Don't mention it. It's not a big deal.
00:50:07.587,00:50:11.717,"But if you pay attention, nothing is trivial."
00:50:23.478,00:50:25.355,There doesn't seem to be a lot of customers here.
00:50:27.023,00:50:28.859,Because the food is so bad.
00:50:32.404,00:50:35.365,My apologies. But it is a perfect place to talk.
00:50:35.449,00:50:36.908,No one will disturb you.
00:50:41.496,00:50:43.415,Your husband works a great deal?
00:50:45.584,00:50:47.252,I have no idea what he's busy with.
00:50:48.587,00:50:56.511,"He's away in Singapore again, but… Having a man is fine as long as he is away from home, right?"
00:51:00.390,00:51:02.601,And what kind of business is he in?
00:51:04.352,00:51:05.687,Import-export.
00:51:06.354,00:51:10.650,"If you're so interested in Mak, I'll bring him along next time."
00:51:11.151,00:51:15.947,"You men have so much to say to each other, but with women, you just make small talk."
00:51:19.034,00:51:23.622,"To me, small talk like this is a rare treat."
00:51:31.713,00:51:37.969,I deal with prominent people who always talk about important state matters and the fate of our nation.
00:51:38.887,00:51:40.639,But I don't care about what they say.
00:51:41.515,00:51:44.184,I see only one thing in their eyes.
00:51:46.144,00:51:47.229,What is it?
00:51:48.730,00:51:49.898,Fear.
00:51:51.817,00:51:55.195,But you… You seem different.
00:51:56.071,00:51:59.282,"You're not afraid, are you?"
00:52:01.952,00:52:02.911,What about you?
00:52:07.582,00:52:11.044,"You're smart, but you're not good at mahjong."
00:52:14.172,00:52:16.675,You're right. I always lose.
00:52:18.218,00:52:19.344,I just won against you.
00:53:13.148,00:53:15.358,Should l pick up your suit when it's ready?
00:53:15.442,00:53:16.276,I'll call you.
00:53:23.950,00:53:25.410,I have another appointment tonight.
00:53:26.578,00:53:29.998,I still have some time. Allow me to drop you off first.
00:53:32.792,00:53:34.169,Would that be inconvenient for you?
00:53:35.629,00:53:36.504,No.
00:53:59.694,00:54:00.612,They're back!
00:54:00.695,00:54:03.156,-Turn off the lights! -Watch them!
00:54:06.159,00:54:08.203,-Thank you. -I'll see you to the door.
00:54:08.286,00:54:09.579,You really shouldn't bother.
00:54:10.580,00:54:11.414,Wait here.
00:54:20.131,00:54:21.424,They're back!
00:54:21.508,00:54:22.425,Lights off!
00:54:30.850,00:54:31.977,They're coming inside!
00:54:37.857,00:54:38.858,Fine with me.
00:54:39.401,00:54:41.903,Just don't blame me if you're late for your appointment.
00:55:01.047,00:55:02.340,You have an appointment.
00:55:03.508,00:55:08.805,"Otherwise, you could send the car away and come in for a cup of tea."
00:56:13.369,00:56:14.329,I need a drink.
00:56:19.459,00:56:20.585,He's so cautious.
00:56:21.461,00:56:24.798,He sent Cao and his bodyguard away while we were at the tailor's.
00:56:24.881,00:56:26.758,It's obvious that he doesn't even trust Cao.
00:56:27.550,00:56:28.551,Simple.
00:56:28.635,00:56:32.347,"Next time, get him in here and we'll finish him off with one shot!"
00:56:32.430,00:56:34.099,He'd never come inside because of Mak.
00:56:35.100,00:56:36.726,He would only take me someplace secluded.
00:56:36.810,00:56:38.561,Cao probably doesn't even know the place.
00:56:40.939,00:56:42.065,Did he try anything?
00:56:42.899,00:56:44.567,Mr. Mak is jealous.
00:56:47.779,00:56:51.199,Not yet. But I knew what was on his mind.
00:56:51.866,00:56:53.701,"Otherwise, he wouldn't have seen me to the door."
00:56:53.785,00:56:58.706,"He just didn't dare to come in, but he kept me at the door for a long time."
00:57:04.462,00:57:05.672,He said he'd call again.
00:57:06.214,00:57:10.009,"I wanted to lure him into a theater, where it's easier to get away afterwards."
00:57:11.386,00:57:13.304,But he's so cautious.
00:57:13.388,00:57:15.014,He said he doesn't go into dark places.
00:57:18.852,00:57:20.895,"If he calls again, then it's serious."
00:57:22.397,00:57:25.942,That means I'm agreeing to be his mistress.
00:57:29.362,00:57:35.285,And then have you thought about what we're going to do next?
00:58:16.284,00:58:17.660,Would you know what to do?
00:58:19.454,00:58:20.663,With a man?
00:58:25.126,00:58:26.544,So you've already discussed it.
00:58:40.433,00:58:41.434,Which one?
00:58:47.315,00:58:49.150,Lang Junsheng is the only one experienced.
00:58:50.902,00:58:52.195,With whores?
00:59:50.878,00:59:52.046,Want a drink?
00:59:52.714,00:59:53.631,No need.
01:00:18.156,01:00:19.157,The lights.
01:02:21.112,01:02:22.697,You seem to be having a reaction today.
01:02:23.781,01:02:25.199,I don't want to talk about it.
01:02:58.274,01:02:59.275,Wong Chiachi.
01:02:59.358,01:03:00.401,Time to eat.
01:03:00.485,01:03:01.569,I'm not hungry.
01:03:04.489,01:03:05.865,We made some congee.
01:03:30.056,01:03:31.766,-Hello? -Is this Mrs. Mak?
01:03:31.849,01:03:34.560,"Mrs. Yee, hi."
01:03:34.644,01:03:36.145,Hi.
01:03:36.229,01:03:38.981,"I called a couple of days ago, but you were out."
01:03:39.065,01:03:41.234,What's the matter?
01:03:41.317,01:03:43.778,I wanted to see if the tailor was done.
01:03:46.239,01:03:48.908,You don't want them anymore? Why?
01:03:59.293,01:04:00.545,You're moving back to Shanghai?
01:04:07.426,01:04:09.011,Congratulations to both of you.
01:04:10.763,01:04:13.099,I'll come by right now.
01:04:15.351,01:04:18.062,I haven't heard from you for a few days.
01:04:18.145,01:04:20.022,I should pay you a visit.
01:04:31.909,01:04:33.411,I'll go to the airport tomorrow.
01:04:34.537,01:04:37.915,I should… I should at least treat you to dinner.
01:04:39.125,01:04:40.418,You're leaving just like that?
01:04:41.210,01:04:50.553,I… All right.
01:04:53.931,01:04:55.850,Please give my regards to Mr. Yee.
01:04:57.018,01:04:58.811,Have a safe trip.
01:05:01.856,01:05:02.940,Bye.
01:06:10.341,01:06:11.384,You're moving?
01:06:11.968,01:06:13.594,I hope I'm not disturbing anyone.
01:06:14.512,01:06:16.555,"Huang, I see you're a mover now, not a driver?"
01:06:21.227,01:06:22.645,"Cao, what are you doing here?"
01:06:23.229,01:06:27.984,I thought I'd give my regards to Mr. and Mrs. Mak and all their cute little children.
01:06:31.362,01:06:32.571,What do you want?
01:06:36.075,01:06:39.120,I had my suspicions from the start.
01:06:39.203,01:06:42.957,But I kept silent until I could see what your game was.
01:06:43.582,01:06:47.128,So Mr. Mak goes to Lingnan University?
01:06:47.795,01:06:49.463,"Cao, don't do anything reckless!"
01:06:57.680,01:06:58.848,This is what we'll do.
01:06:59.974,01:07:05.771,"Yee's going to Shanghai without me, so I should just turn over a new leaf."
01:07:05.855,01:07:08.274,I know a lot more than you do.
01:07:08.357,01:07:11.861,Your superiors would surely find me more valuable than you.
01:07:14.321,01:07:15.531,How much do you want?
01:07:16.991,01:07:20.619,"For you guys, at least ten bars of gold."
01:07:20.703,01:07:22.788,And that's not counting Mrs. Mak.
01:07:25.332,01:07:28.127,Mr. Yee would surely be willing to pay a premium for her.
01:07:30.254,01:07:31.130,You're asking for it!
01:07:33.132,01:07:34.592,You're something else.
01:07:34.675,01:07:36.510,I had no idea that you were a spy.
01:07:36.594,01:07:39.263,You should have helped me.
01:07:39.346,01:07:40.306,Why did you use me?
01:07:40.389,01:07:42.058,We're from the same hometown after all.
01:07:58.657,01:07:59.742,Beat him up.
01:08:36.737,01:08:37.863,You work for a traitor.
01:08:37.947,01:08:39.698,You should know what's coming!

01:12:50.949,01:12:51.992,You're back.
01:12:52.076,01:12:53.160,Good morning.
01:12:58.707,01:12:59.917,"Aunt, I'm back."
01:13:00.959,01:13:02.252,Any letters from your dad?
01:13:04.671,01:13:06.173,I'll check later.

01:13:28.654,01:13:30.447,You still let her go to school?
01:13:31.281,01:13:33.700,I sold the house that her dad left her.
01:13:33.784,01:13:36.245,I promised to let her finish school.
01:13:36.328,01:13:37.663,I keep my word.

01:15:02.080,01:15:05.125,Asia is returning to the hands of the Asians.
01:15:05.209,01:15:54.967,"Until that happens, we will fight unceasingly for freedom… You never knew, did you?"
01:15:56.260,01:16:00.389,"In Hong Kong, we were secretly being watched."
01:16:01.265,01:16:04.017,"The night you left, they came to us."
01:16:04.101,01:16:07.104,They cleaned up the mess and smuggled us out.
01:16:08.438,01:16:09.523,Who were they?
01:16:11.149,01:16:12.276,Chongqing sent them.
01:16:14.152,01:16:21.243,"The assassination of Shanghai mayor, Fu Xiaohuan, Public Concession Chief, Lu Yunkui, and Foreign Minister, Chen Lu, were done by them."
01:16:22.494,01:16:24.037,Now you know how childish we were.
01:16:26.498,01:16:27.708,How absurd.
01:16:29.167,01:16:31.253,"Yes, especially me."
01:16:31.336,01:16:32.462,I was so naive.
01:16:35.257,01:16:36.258,It was my fault.
01:16:39.928,01:16:41.471,We all paid a price.
01:16:46.101,01:16:47.269,How's everybody?
01:16:48.812,01:16:49.855,They're around.
01:16:51.440,01:16:52.482,Where?
01:16:55.652,01:16:58.739,Several places. I can't tell you now.
01:17:01.700,01:17:03.118,I've been looking for you.
01:17:08.832,01:17:10.292,I didn't return to school.
01:17:11.209,01:17:13.337,"For a while, I taught language at a community center."
01:17:16.715,01:17:18.800,I can't quite recall what I did during this time.
01:17:21.720,01:17:26.183,"My dad sent me a letter, saying he couldn't afford to bring me to England."
01:17:26.767,01:17:29.311,He told me to resume my studies in Shanghai and live with my aunt.

01:17:52.626,01:17:54.294,I'm glad you've gone back to school.
01:17:56.088,01:17:57.631,That would be impossible for me.
01:18:04.388,01:18:05.722,Why did you come to see me?
01:18:06.598,01:18:07.808,Just to say you're sorry?
01:18:12.062,01:18:13.271,I have a mission.

01:18:35.877,01:18:37.713,We missed our chance three years ago.

01:20:22.234,01:20:24.778,You've been living in Hong Kong. You have no relatives in Shanghai.

01:20:58.478,01:21:11.366,"Remember your phone number at home and Mak's office phone, what was lacking in Hong Kong the most last year, what can't we get in Shanghai, your bank account number… You must remember everything."
01:21:11.449,01:21:12.701,Answer without hesitation.
01:21:12.784,01:21:18.790,"That is the first step. You must realize that once you're in, there's no turning back."
01:21:32.012,01:21:35.891,"Stockings, western medicine, you must remember all the prices here."
01:21:35.974,01:21:38.101,My part is done.
01:21:38.184,01:21:40.478,"Now, it's your show. Any questions?"
01:21:42.188,01:21:44.357,I wrote my dad a letter.
01:21:44.441,01:21:46.526,Please mail it for me after you read it.
01:21:48.653,01:21:51.865,"After the mission, we'll send you to England."
01:21:56.119,01:21:58.330,All right. Go get dressed.
01:21:58.413,01:21:59.956,I'd like to meet Mrs. Mak.
01:22:05.962,01:22:07.047,What about your part?
01:22:08.214,01:22:09.174,The car is ready.
01:22:09.257,01:22:10.884,Her hotel room has been paid for the week.
01:22:10.967,01:22:12.677,That's Wang's headquarters.
01:22:12.761,01:22:15.597,"Mrs. Yee often eats there, so they're bound to run into each other."
01:22:44.834,01:22:46.419,-Wait for me in the study. -Yes.
01:22:52.801,01:22:55.762,She came here from Hong Kong to help him out.
01:22:55.845,01:23:01.685,"In Hong Kong, we often… Mrs. Liao and I went to eat at Great East Asia."
01:23:01.768,01:23:03.269,We met over there.
01:23:03.353,01:23:07.023,"She's been to Shanghai several times, staying at Great East Asia, and we never knew."
01:23:07.107,01:23:08.566,It's really my fault.
01:23:08.650,01:23:12.028,"I should have contacted you sooner, but I've been busy with Mak's business."
01:23:12.112,01:23:13.863,This house is full of empty rooms.
01:23:13.947,01:23:16.825,Why waste your money at a hotel?
01:23:16.908,01:23:18.827,Hong Kong. I haven't been there for a while.
01:23:19.744,01:23:21.329,You're home?
01:23:21.413,01:23:22.831,You remember Mrs. Mak?
01:23:24.124,01:23:27.335,"How are you, Mr. Yee? I'm sure you don't remember me."
01:23:28.420,01:23:29.295,I do.
01:23:29.379,01:23:31.464,How is Mr. Mak? How's business?
01:23:32.340,01:23:34.050,It's quite difficult. Thanks for asking.
01:23:34.134,01:23:35.176,Pong.
01:23:35.260,01:23:36.928,Mr. Yee seems to have lost some weight.
01:23:37.012,01:23:39.514,I asked him to think twice before accepting the minister post.
01:23:39.597,01:23:41.474,You pay with your life and step on so many toes.
01:23:42.267,01:23:43.977,"All right, enjoy."
01:23:47.355,01:23:49.399,Your husband is such a nice man.
01:23:49.983,01:23:51.317,He's putting on a show for you.
01:23:54.279,01:23:56.031,You're still going to Great East Asia today?
01:23:56.114,01:23:57.532,Aren't you sick of eating there?
01:23:57.615,01:24:00.076,It's safer there with the security agents.
01:24:00.785,01:24:01.703,Why?
01:24:01.786,01:24:04.205,They're afraid of bombs. It's a mess these days.
01:24:04.289,01:24:06.666,So the guards just shoot anyone suspicious.
01:24:06.750,01:24:07.584,Kong.
01:24:08.168,01:24:12.464,My sister in Singapore says that things are getting worse there.
01:24:12.547,01:24:13.798,She told me not to come.
01:24:14.299,01:24:15.425,Is Hong Kong better?
01:24:15.508,01:24:16.509,How are things there?
01:24:17.135,01:24:19.220,The same. Prices are up by 20%.
01:24:19.846,01:24:21.848,"Because of the war, the black market is flourishing."
01:24:23.016,01:24:24.726,"Oh, you don't smoke."
01:24:24.809,01:24:26.936,I bought you some Palmers.
01:24:27.020,01:24:28.521,I left them in my bag. I almost forgot.
01:24:29.105,01:24:31.649,Thanks a lot. We can't even get them on the black market.
01:24:32.358,01:24:33.401,"I got it, sir."
01:24:33.485,01:24:36.321,"You say they do business, right?"
01:24:36.404,01:24:38.114,Which line of business?
01:24:38.198,01:24:40.408,Mrs. Yee has a guest here.
01:24:40.492,01:24:41.993,She didn't know that you were coming.
01:25:08.937,01:25:13.191,"This room is small, but it's safer here."
01:25:14.150,01:25:15.985,I don't want to bother you and Mrs. Yee.
01:25:16.611,01:25:18.530,She likes having a mahjong companion here.
01:25:18.613,01:25:20.073,And I'm hardly home anyway.
01:25:23.952,01:25:26.496,You must be very busy. You've lost a lot of weight.
01:25:35.880,01:25:37.382,You have also changed.
01:25:44.722,01:25:48.768,It has been three years. The war is still not over.
01:25:49.894,01:25:52.438,For us both to see each other alive is a blessing.
01:25:58.361,01:26:01.239,I've brought a few things. Cigarettes for Mrs. Yee.
01:26:01.781,01:26:03.116,I don't know what you like.
01:26:05.243,01:26:06.411,Your presence is enough.
01:26:36.316,01:26:37.775,That's the floor plan of Yee's home.
01:26:37.859,01:26:40.445,The front door is sealed. The only entrance is at the back.
01:26:40.528,01:26:42.155,There are two drivers with surnames Guo and Yao.
01:26:42.238,01:26:45.074,The housekeeper and the servants are from the same hometown as Yee.
01:26:45.158,01:26:47.911,The drivers never leave the car. I'm not sure if they're spies for Yee.
01:26:48.411,01:26:50.788,Everyone is searched before getting into the car.
01:26:50.872,01:26:51.873,What about Yee?
01:26:53.458,01:26:56.586,I only saw him once. He's mostly out.
01:26:57.170,01:27:00.673,He's in his study when he's home. I haven't found a chance yet.
01:27:02.133,01:27:05.094,-His secretary's surname is Chang. -What is his name?
01:27:05.178,01:27:06.137,I don't know yet.
01:27:06.804,01:27:08.181,Be careful.
01:27:10.016,01:27:11.142,I need money.
01:27:12.644,01:27:13.811,That's all for now.
01:27:16.814,01:27:19.025,"How come you play mahjong daily, but you never get better?"
01:27:20.944,01:27:23.488,I need to remember so many things. I can't concentrate.
01:27:28.326,01:27:31.037,How are they? Huang Lei and the others.
01:27:32.038,01:27:35.375,They ask about you a lot. You'll see them eventually.
01:27:39.796,01:27:41.506,Good thing you didn't come with me last night.
01:27:41.589,01:27:42.882,I came back with a headache.
01:27:43.508,01:27:44.801,What did they perform?
01:27:45.426,01:27:48.429,Wu Family Hill. Gosh. It was out of tune and offbeat.
01:27:49.013,01:27:50.974,The top artists are all hiding in Hong Kong.
01:27:51.057,01:27:58.106,"So I told Yee that if Wang government can't even have a good show, how can you win the hearts of the people?"
01:27:58.189,01:27:59.148,Do you agree?
01:27:59.232,01:28:00.191,Good morning.
01:28:00.900,01:28:01.985,"Good morning, Mr. Yee."
01:28:05.947,01:28:09.534,"The herbal medicine you're taking has turtle shells and deer horns, you're not supposed to drink tea."
01:28:11.452,01:28:15.039,It boosts his blood circulation. He gets cold feet at night.
01:28:15.123,01:28:17.875,I keep him warm.
01:28:19.669,01:28:21.045,I have to stay awake for a meeting.
01:28:21.838,01:28:23.006,What are your plans for today?
01:28:23.965,01:28:27.385,Mrs. Liao wants me to play mahjong at her home with her grandma.
01:28:28.970,01:28:30.805,"You're not forcing our guest to go along, right?"
01:28:31.597,01:28:32.849,Mrs. Yee has given me a day off.
01:28:32.932,01:28:34.434,I'm going to the movies this afternoon.
01:28:54.871,01:28:57.332,It's raining. Mr. Yee told me to give you a ride.
01:29:13.431,01:29:15.224,Is this the way to the Majestic Theater?
01:29:41.417,01:29:43.002,The car will wait for you.
01:31:03.583,01:31:04.750,Don't scare me like that!
01:32:02.350,01:32:03.434,My hair!
01:32:04.602,01:32:05.853,Are you playing hard to get?
01:32:08.522,01:32:09.815,You like it this way?
01:32:11.984,01:32:12.985,Sit down.
01:32:17.156,01:32:18.074,Sit down.
01:35:01.445,01:35:02.405,Your coat.
01:35:32.476,01:36:07.720,She is quiet With lowered head and racing heart He Bows formally Just to play his part She quivers… What are you doing here?
01:36:07.803,01:36:09.054,I'm hosting a party next door.
01:36:09.847,01:36:11.640,Mr. Yee caught us shopping.
01:36:12.892,01:36:15.394,What a rare honor. Sit down and listen to this with us.
01:36:16.020,01:36:16.937,Just for a little bit.
01:36:17.021,01:36:17.980,Here.
01:36:29.950,01:36:31.452,You understand the dialect of Suzhou?
01:36:32.620,01:36:33.829,A little bit.
01:36:33.913,01:36:35.789,I liked listening to it when I was a girl.
01:36:35.873,01:36:37.750,But I couldn't do that when I went to Hong Kong.
01:36:39.919,01:36:41.837,"But now you're back, right?"
01:36:44.298,01:36:48.010,Only for a while. I'll be going back to Hong Kong soon.
01:36:48.761,01:36:49.637,In just a few days.
01:36:50.221,01:36:52.723,Tell me what you want and I'll make sure to bring it.
01:37:33.514,01:37:35.307,"Mrs. Mak, would you like some breakfast?"
01:37:35.849,01:37:37.351,"No, thank you. I'm not hungry yet."
01:37:38.018,01:37:39.395,Where are Mr. and Mrs. Yee?
01:37:39.478,01:37:40.813,Mrs. Yee is still sleeping.
01:37:40.896,01:37:42.940,Mr. Yee has gone to Nanjing for a meeting.
01:37:44.400,01:37:45.526,To Nanjing?
01:37:45.609,01:37:46.610,Yes.
01:37:47.695,01:37:48.821,When will he be back?
01:37:48.904,01:37:50.155,I don't know.
01:37:59.623,01:38:02.126,"Mrs. Leung sprained her ankle, so I'm going to see her."
01:38:02.209,01:38:04.295,Mrs. Mak still has a headache.
01:38:04.378,01:38:05.921,Give her two aspirins when she wakes up.
01:38:06.005,01:38:07.339,I won't be at home all day.
01:38:07.423,01:38:09.133,-I'll let you handle it. -Don't worry.
01:38:09.216,01:38:11.468,"If she wants, bring her some congee."
01:38:11.552,01:38:12.386,Okay.
01:39:20.871,01:39:24.249,What if I told you I hate you?
01:39:26.877,01:39:28.337,I would believe you.
01:39:37.304,01:39:38.931,They weren't like this three years ago.
01:39:40.808,01:39:41.725,I hate you.
01:39:42.768,01:39:43.977,I said I believe you.
01:39:44.645,01:39:46.730,I haven't believed anyone in a long time.
01:39:48.065,01:39:50.901,Let me hear it again. I believe you.
01:39:52.444,01:39:53.987,You must be very lonely.
01:39:55.155,01:39:56.532,But I'm still alive.
01:40:01.453,01:40:03.789,You've been gone without a word for four days.
01:40:04.540,01:40:06.834,I hated you every minute.
01:40:09.420,01:40:12.840,"Now that I'm back, do you still hate me?"
01:40:15.467,01:40:16.635,No.
01:40:20.305,01:40:22.015,Are you still going back to Hong Kong?
01:40:24.309,01:40:25.936,I want to go back.
01:43:28.577,01:43:30.203,Get me an apartment.
01:44:01.193,01:44:02.277,My sister.
01:44:04.112,01:44:04.947,My brother.
01:44:05.030,01:44:08.867,"Whatever happens, you can't break the law."
01:44:08.951,01:44:10.661,I didn't do it.
01:44:11.828,01:44:12.955,Why did you come here?
01:44:13.497,01:44:15.290,I went to the tea house to look for you.
01:44:15.374,01:44:17.501,Some of our top people have been arrested.
01:44:18.001,01:44:19.544,They raided a bunch of our safehouses.
01:44:19.628,01:44:21.129,"Luckily, Auyang got away."
01:44:21.630,01:44:23.298,We must be cautious.
01:44:23.382,01:44:25.425,You can't go to any of the old places.
01:44:26.927,01:44:28.303,When are we going to strike?
01:44:31.014,01:44:32.349,We have to wait for the orders.
01:44:32.933,01:44:36.019,I lent it to him. Go.
01:44:36.103,01:44:37.562,Can you tell them to hurry?
01:44:38.563,01:44:40.899,"Afterward, can we all leave?"
01:44:42.359,01:44:44.820,I can't say. I don't know.
01:44:51.451,01:44:52.703,He's gone again these days.
01:44:52.786,01:44:54.329,The housekeeper said he went to Nanjing.
01:44:54.871,01:44:56.415,I don't know if it's the truth.
01:44:59.084,01:45:01.003,Maybe there's another woman.
01:45:01.962,01:45:04.965,He took me to Alley 1237 two nights ago.
01:45:05.048,01:45:07.592,I know. We have it staked out.
01:45:14.474,01:45:16.351,There was perfume in the air.
01:45:17.477,01:45:19.312,I can smell jasmines nearby too.
01:45:20.772,01:45:23.025,It doesn't seem like a scent left from that day though.
01:45:24.985,01:45:26.278,There was dust on the pillows.
01:45:27.279,01:45:28.655,I don't know.
01:45:28.739,01:45:29.823,Wong Chiachi.
01:45:31.533,01:45:33.368,-I don't know. -Wong Chiachi.
01:45:33.452,01:45:34.953,"Wong Chiachi, look at me."
01:45:36.747,01:45:37.581,Look at me.
01:45:40.292,01:45:43.837,"I won't let you get hurt, okay?"
01:45:45.714,01:45:47.799,I won't allow it.
01:46:02.606,01:46:04.691,She said she's old and I'm treating her like tofu.
01:46:04.775,01:46:07.736,I said old tofu makes the best Mapo tofu.
01:46:08.528,01:46:10.030,I almost died laughing.
01:46:10.113,01:46:14.493,"When she made a toast to Mr. Yee on his birthday, it was like Mapo tofu wishing him longevity in person."
01:46:15.202,01:46:16.995,Why haven't I seen Mr. Yee these days?
01:46:17.079,01:46:18.789,He's in Nanjing for business.
01:46:18.872,01:46:22.000,She does carry her pockmarks well though.
01:46:22.084,01:46:25.378,"Unlike Mr. Qian's wife, her face is disgusting."
01:46:58.829,01:46:59.830,Close the door.
01:47:19.307,01:47:31.027,LOOK AT THE PAST WITHOUT WORRIES BY MOCHENG I've been waiting for you.
01:47:36.908,01:47:38.535,Then you must be very tired.
01:47:39.578,01:47:40.620,I'm exhausted.
01:47:42.164,01:47:43.707,Mrs. Yee said you're in Nanjing again.
01:47:43.790,01:47:45.125,Don't believe everything you hear.
01:47:45.917,01:47:47.544,I've been very busy in the past few things.
01:47:49.337,01:47:53.633,We busted a Chongqing intelligence post and captured over ten agents.
01:47:54.426,01:47:56.303,They were all highly-trained.
01:47:57.304,01:48:02.392,So I had to interrogate them one by one before I could get any information.
01:48:07.772,01:48:09.191,"Oh, I forgot."
01:48:09.983,01:48:13.445,"You're not interested in my work, are you?"
01:48:13.528,01:48:17.657,It's boring. You've always been careful.
01:48:17.741,01:48:19.201,You've never asked me about it.
01:48:23.330,01:48:24.664,That's your business.
01:48:25.916,01:48:27.959,You don't ask about my business either.
01:48:28.043,01:48:31.046,All I can do is sit here and wait for you.
01:48:35.550,01:48:37.677,Maybe you're seeing someone else.
01:48:37.761,01:48:39.012,I couldn't sleep.
01:48:39.721,01:48:42.224,"If this goes on any longer, you'd slowly get tired of me."
01:48:48.813,01:48:51.441,So that's what you've been thinking about the past few days?
01:48:52.567,01:48:53.985,And losing money at mahjong.
01:48:54.069,01:48:58.615,I've lost almost all my hard-earned money running those errands.
01:49:03.870,01:49:04.871,I should go upstairs.
01:49:05.747,01:49:06.790,Get some sleep.
01:49:11.169,01:49:13.255,I'll take you somewhere nice tomorrow.
01:49:22.806,01:49:24.849,Don't ever come into this room again.
01:49:33.400,01:49:35.068,Come get some!
01:49:37.487,01:49:40.532,Move!
01:49:41.449,01:49:44.202,Move!
01:49:45.078,01:49:47.580,Move!
01:50:30.457,01:50:31.374,Take me back.
01:50:32.584,01:50:34.210,The minister said you should wait here.
01:50:36.004,01:50:37.380,It's been over two hours.
01:50:59.694,01:51:03.490,Two people suddenly came. Let's go.
01:51:23.760,01:51:27.347,I was freezing outside. You could have let me in.
01:51:30.683,01:51:31.726,Wait inside?
01:51:37.107,01:51:38.525,You want to go into that place?
01:51:43.905,01:51:45.407,You really want to visit my office?
01:51:45.490,01:51:46.950,Forget it. Let's just go.
01:51:49.744,01:51:51.246,Why are you staring at me this way?
01:51:52.789,01:51:54.165,You shouldn't be this beautiful.
01:51:55.875,01:51:57.085,I was thinking of you today.
01:51:58.962,01:52:01.047,Chang told me my mind was wandering.
01:52:01.131,01:52:02.799,He came to report something.
01:52:03.341,01:52:07.262,"I see his mouth open and close, but I couldn't hear a word."
01:52:09.389,01:52:11.391,I could smell you.
01:52:12.642,01:52:13.726,It was distracting.
01:52:16.312,01:52:17.355,Two men.
01:52:18.565,01:52:21.359,We arrested two men at the train station today.
01:52:21.443,01:52:23.445,Very important members of Chongqing.
01:52:25.905,01:52:27.449,They stabbed and killed our people.
01:52:28.658,01:52:32.787,"When our agents arrested them, the other one got his head sliced open."
01:52:32.871,01:52:35.206,"We still had to drag them back to interrogate them, you know?"
01:52:37.750,01:52:39.461,I went down with Chang.
01:52:40.253,01:52:41.754,One was dead already.
01:52:42.505,01:52:44.716,"Half of his brain was gone, even his eyeball."
01:52:45.842,01:52:47.051,I recognized the other one.
01:52:47.135,01:52:48.845,We were classmates at the military academy.
01:52:49.679,01:52:53.808,"When I saw him hanging from the iron bar, I couldn't speak."
01:52:54.767,01:52:58.188,I began to imagine him on top of you.
01:52:58.688,01:53:02.609,The bastard's blood spilled all over my shoes!
01:53:02.692,01:53:04.569,I had to wipe the blood off. Do you understand?
01:55:59.911,01:56:02.038,Did he really promise you an apartment?
01:56:03.623,01:56:06.417,I told Mrs. Yee I'd be moving out next Sunday.
01:56:07.126,01:56:09.796,He was there. I don't think he'll change his mind.
01:56:10.797,01:56:14.759,Great. The old wolf is finally letting his guard down.
01:56:15.385,01:56:17.512,"When we get the location, we can make a move."
01:56:18.054,01:56:19.055,No rush.
01:56:19.931,01:56:20.890,What are we waiting for?
01:56:21.683,01:56:22.767,We need information.
01:56:22.850,01:56:27.063,He broke our information post and took the advanced weapons the Americans sent us.
01:56:27.146,01:56:28.356,That was a huge loss.
01:56:29.357,01:56:32.193,What's strange is that the Japanese are also trying to locate the weapons.
01:56:32.819,01:56:35.947,"Wong Chiachi is a precious lead, we must make use of her fully."
01:56:36.030,01:56:37.865,But she is not a trained spy.
01:56:37.949,01:56:40.243,She can't take the long-term pressure!
01:56:40.326,01:56:41.577,You're underestimating her.
01:56:42.120,01:56:47.208,"Wong Chiachi's strength lies in the fact that she just thinks of herself as Mrs. Mak, not an agent."
01:56:47.291,01:56:49.043,"She has come this far, that's no small feat."
01:56:49.127,01:56:50.461,Our superiors are very impressed.
01:56:51.170,01:56:55.383,We've sent two other superbly trained women to try to snare him.
01:56:55.466,01:56:57.301,But he sniffed them out.
01:56:57.385,01:56:59.929,"Not only were they killed, but they gave up a list of people!"
01:57:00.013,01:57:02.306,You don't care about her safety at all.
01:57:02.390,01:57:04.517,She's gotten Yee hooked like she was supposed to.
01:57:04.600,01:57:06.102,"Now, we should take over!"
01:57:06.185,01:57:07.687,Don't tell me what to do!
01:57:07.770,01:57:08.646,You listen to me!
01:57:09.814,01:57:15.278,"Yee murdered my wife and both my children, but I can still eat with him at the same table!"
01:57:15.361,01:57:16.738,That's what an agent does!
01:57:17.321,01:57:19.824,I'd like nothing better than to kill him with my own hands.
01:57:20.408,01:57:23.870,"But if letting him live is more valuable, I'll keep him alive longer!"
01:57:27.415,01:57:30.251,Keep him hooked and keep me informed.
01:57:30.334,01:57:32.712,Don't do anything without my orders!
01:57:33.504,01:57:34.547,Remember.
01:57:34.630,01:57:36.799,"For an agent, there is only one thing."
01:57:36.883,01:57:38.301,Loyalty.
01:57:38.384,01:57:41.137,"To the party, to our leader, to our country. Understand?"
01:57:44.223,01:57:48.102,Don't worry. I'll do whatever you say.
01:57:50.730,01:57:52.607,Good. Very good.
01:57:53.399,01:57:56.110,All you need to do is keep him trapped.
01:57:56.194,01:57:58.988,If you need anything-- What trap are you talking about?
01:58:00.073,01:58:03.159,My body? What do you take him for?
01:58:04.660,01:58:06.704,He knows how to put on an act better than you.
01:58:07.872,01:58:14.962,"Not only does he get inside my body, but he worms his way even deeper into my heart like a snake."
01:58:16.380,01:58:18.591,I must let him in like a slave.
01:58:19.509,01:58:23.805,"I can only play my part faithfully, so I can get into his heart too."
01:58:24.722,01:58:35.066,"Every time, he must let me bleed and scream before he is satisfied, before he feels that he's alive."
01:58:36.359,01:58:40.404,"In the dark, only he knows that this is all real."
01:58:41.030,01:58:42.490,That's enough. Stop it.
01:58:42.573,01:58:49.872,"That's why… That's why I can also torture him until he can't stand it and still, I go on until I collapse from exhaustion."
01:58:49.956,01:58:51.124,Enough!
01:58:51.207,01:59:01.134,"And every time he's finally done, I'd think maybe this is when you'll rush in, shoot him in the back of the head and his blood and brains will cover me!"
01:59:01.217,01:59:02.176,Shut up!
01:59:54.562,01:59:56.856,Is it Mr. Yee's idea to come to the Japanese district?
02:00:25.885,02:00:26.844,Good evening.
02:00:29.722,02:00:31.057,Welcome.
02:00:31.849,02:00:33.100,I'm looking for Mr. Yee.
02:00:33.726,02:00:35.978,All right. Please go upstairs.
02:00:54.288,02:00:55.331,"Hey, ma'am."
02:00:57.041,02:00:58.834,"Wow, a pretty one."
02:00:58.918,02:01:00.586,Come in.
02:01:00.670,02:01:03.464,Come here right now!
02:01:04.006,02:01:05.258,Colonel Nakamura.
02:01:07.677,02:01:09.220,-I’m sorry. -Enough!
02:01:10.012,02:01:11.347,"Hey, ma'am."
02:01:11.430,02:01:13.182,Even a girl dumped you!
02:01:14.517,02:01:16.560,"I'm so sorry, Colonel Sato."
02:01:19.522,02:01:21.983,"She is a customer, not one of our girls."
02:01:22.066,02:01:25.236,"Keiko, come and keep Colonel Sato company."
02:01:25.319,02:01:27.697,I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
02:01:32.660,02:01:36.414,Excuse us. Enjoy yourselves.
02:01:39.417,02:01:40.751,My apologies.
02:01:54.432,02:01:55.766,Your guest is here.
02:02:05.609,02:02:08.404,I punished myself by making myself wait for you.
02:02:10.156,02:02:11.532,Why are we meeting here?
02:02:11.615,02:02:12.950,I just finished some business.
02:02:26.005,02:02:31.927,It’s full now… The custom paperwork will be handful as well.
02:02:49.195,02:02:51.614,"Listen, they sing like they're crying."
02:02:52.156,02:02:54.033,Like dogs howling for their dead owners.
02:02:54.825,02:02:57.661,"The Japanese kill people like flies, but deep down, they're very scared."
02:02:58.371,02:03:08.964,"They know their days are numbered since the Americans entered the war, yet here they are with their painted faces singing their off-tune songs."
02:03:11.592,02:03:12.676,Listen to them.
02:03:37.368,02:03:39.328,I know why you brought me here.
02:03:40.746,02:03:41.747,Why?
02:03:42.623,02:03:44.208,You want me to be your whore.
02:03:46.794,02:03:47.878,Whore?
02:03:50.131,02:03:53.676,"I brought you here, so I know better than you on how to be one."
02:04:04.645,02:04:07.523,Let me sing for you. I'm a much better singer than them.
02:04:08.566,02:04:09.608,Is that so?
02:04:22.329,02:07:17.296,"From the end of the earth To the farthest sea I search and search For my heart's companion The young girl sings Her man plays Our hearts are united Our hearts are united Looking north From the mountain My tears fall and wet my blouse The young girl misses him until now Only love that lasts Through hard times is true Only love that lasts Through hard times is true In life Who does not Cherish the springtime of youth The young girl to her man Is like thread to its needle We're like a threaded needle, Never to be separated We're like A threaded needle Never to be separated Go home first. I have work to do."
02:07:18.464,02:07:19.506,At this hour?
02:07:24.386,02:07:26.055,I want you to do something for me.
02:07:28.557,02:07:31.560,Take this to the address written on the envelope tomorrow.
02:07:31.644,02:07:33.896,Ask for a man named Khalid Saiduddin.
02:07:33.979,02:07:35.022,Can you remember that?
02:07:37.941,02:07:39.068,Khalid Saiduddin.
02:07:39.777,02:07:45.574,"If he tells you anything or gives you anything, come back and tell me."
02:07:46.367,02:07:50.537,Keep it a secret. Just between us.
02:08:13.227,02:08:29.368,JING-AN TEMPLE YEE MOCHENG It's a business card. Just Yee's name.
02:08:33.372,02:08:35.457,Put it back. What do you think?
02:08:36.250,02:08:38.168,I'm worried that he's suspecting Wong Chiachi.
02:08:39.461,02:08:42.756,"If we check the place first, we might fall into his trap."
02:08:44.842,02:08:46.760,But it's dangerous for Wong Chiachi to go alone.
02:08:48.595,02:08:50.305,We'd better keep watch outside.
02:08:56.478,02:08:57.521,Go as soon as possible.
02:09:12.453,02:09:13.704,Wong Chiachi.
02:09:17.040,02:09:18.208,I'm so sorry.
02:09:37.728,02:09:39.313,You could have done that three years ago.
02:09:40.022,02:09:41.356,Why didn't you?
02:11:31.091,02:11:32.342,Sir.
02:11:32.426,02:11:33.886,There’s someone here to meet you.
02:11:34.595,02:11:36.555,She has an envelope for you.
02:11:36.638,02:11:38.557,She said she’ll only give it to you.
02:11:44.521,02:11:45.522,"All right, you can go."
02:13:41.054,02:13:42.055,Pigeon egg.
02:14:00.657,02:14:01.491,Hello?
02:14:02.117,02:14:04.202,"Hello? My second brother, it's me."
02:14:04.286,02:14:05.287,Yes.
02:14:06.038,02:14:07.706,I'm calling from Kiessling's Cafe.
02:14:07.789,02:14:09.416,Is everything okay at home?
02:14:10.625,02:14:11.585,Yes.
02:14:12.252,02:14:13.462,I'm doing good.
02:14:13.545,02:14:15.714,Just too busy to call.
02:14:18.550,02:14:20.177,I'm planning to go shopping today.
02:14:20.260,02:14:21.762,I have an appointment. I'm going now.
02:14:23.430,02:14:24.556,Okay.
02:14:25.849,02:14:27.184,That's all.
02:14:30.312,02:14:32.355,All right. We're fine here.
02:14:35.400,02:14:37.861,I'll get going. Bye.
02:16:21.673,02:16:22.549,I'm late.
02:16:23.049,02:16:24.259,Ferguson Road.
02:16:37.606,02:16:40.317,Let's go to the jewelry shop first. It's around the area.
02:16:40.400,02:16:41.860,The ring should be ready.
02:16:44.321,02:16:45.530,Go back.
02:17:21.691,02:17:22.817,Wait here.
02:18:01.439,02:18:02.399,What's the matter?
02:18:02.899,02:18:04.025,Nothing.
02:18:25.005,02:18:28.925,It's a northeastern accent. You can't… Yes.
02:18:34.681,02:18:35.682,Sir.
02:19:31.404,02:19:33.323,Do you like the diamond I picked?
02:19:34.199,02:19:36.076,The diamond itself is of no interest to me.
02:19:36.785,02:19:38.828,I just want to see it on your hand.
02:20:04.145,02:20:05.230,Keep it on.
02:20:11.694,02:20:16.116,I… I don't want to wear something so expensive on the street.
02:20:19.119,02:20:20.537,You're with me.
02:21:05.540,02:21:06.541,Go.
02:21:19.345,02:21:20.180,Let's go!
02:21:22.223,02:21:23.516,Let's go.
02:22:42.136,02:22:43.221,Rickshaw!
02:22:51.646,02:22:52.814,"Get on, miss."
02:22:54.232,02:22:55.191,Where to?
02:22:55.817,02:22:56.818,Ferguson Road.
02:22:56.901,02:22:57.944,Okay. Come on.
02:23:18.923,02:23:19.799,Going home?
02:23:24.012,02:23:24.887,Yes.
02:23:55.043,02:23:56.461,The road is blocked again.
02:24:04.761,02:24:06.596,-Stop! -Stop!
02:24:06.679,02:24:09.265,-Stop! -Stop!
02:24:10.058,02:24:11.684,We can't go any further.
02:24:11.768,02:24:13.061,It looks like a long wait.
02:24:14.812,02:24:17.857,What's going on?
02:24:19.567,02:24:20.860,Let me pass. It's late.
02:24:20.943,02:24:22.403,Go away.
02:24:22.487,02:24:25.323,Let me pass. It's late.
02:24:25.406,02:24:27.450,I have to go home and cook.
02:24:28.159,02:24:31.204,"They'd let you pass to see a doctor, not to cook."
02:24:46.969,02:24:48.054,Wong Chiachi.
02:24:52.350,02:24:53.393,Come up.
02:25:18.334,02:25:19.460,They're all college students.
02:25:20.002,02:25:23.172,Six in total. They had a patriotic drama club in Hong Kong before.
02:25:23.256,02:25:27.719,"The girl's name is Wong Chiachi, once written up for her dramatic performance at the Hong Kong University."
02:25:27.802,02:25:30.805,The leader's surname is Kuang. We've been tailing him for a while.
02:25:30.888,02:25:31.889,It's a shame.
02:25:31.973,02:25:34.517,"We almost got Wu, but he escaped."
02:25:35.184,02:25:37.603,The gunner probably got away through Ping'an Cinema.
02:25:37.687,02:25:39.772,They all had movie tickets to help them get away.
02:25:39.856,02:25:46.571,Those students… You knew about them?
02:25:47.488,02:25:49.198,Why didn't you tell me?
02:25:52.118,02:25:57.582,It was because… It was because of your relationship with Ms. Wong.
02:26:00.460,02:26:02.712,"Of course, everything is clear now."
02:26:03.880,02:26:05.965,She's in the interrogation room.
02:26:06.966,02:26:08.801,You'd probably want to interrogate her yourself?
02:26:11.929,02:26:12.930,She's downstairs?
02:26:14.932,02:26:16.684,Luo and Fan are watching her.
02:26:18.478,02:26:20.229,We've already broken the others.
02:26:20.313,02:26:22.523,They were very easy. Their stories matched.
02:26:24.525,02:26:26.152,Then I have nothing to ask.
02:26:27.570,02:26:29.197,We have all the information we need.
02:26:34.118,02:26:36.579,So how do we proceed?
02:26:48.382,02:26:49.759,Take them to the South Quarry.
02:26:50.760,02:26:56.599,APPROVED BY MOCHENG Total news blackout. Take care of them by ten o'clock.
02:27:13.115,02:27:13.991,All right.
02:27:15.701,02:27:17.036,Your ring.
02:27:19.497,02:27:20.706,It's not mine.
02:27:42.186,02:27:43.020,Go.
02:27:43.646,02:27:44.480,Go!
02:27:56.993,02:27:58.077,Kneel!

02:28:12.758,02:28:13.801,Kneel!
02:28:14.760,02:28:15.720,Kneel!
02:28:16.554,02:28:17.638,Kneel!
02:29:16.656,02:29:18.282,Why don't we go to Jiuru?
02:29:18.366,02:29:19.659,Didn't Mrs. Yang invite us there?
02:29:19.742,02:29:21.160,Always Hunan or Sichuan cuisine.
02:29:21.243,02:29:22.161,They're too spicy.
02:29:22.244,02:29:24.664,"If you can't eat spicy food, you'd have no spice in your game."
02:29:41.013,02:29:44.976,What's so good about spicy food? My housekeeper cooks better.
02:29:45.059,02:29:53.901,Tonight… Mrs. Ma… Right. We should find a place to eat Yangzhou food.
02:29:55.945,02:29:57.196,What's going on?
02:29:58.572,02:30:03.077,Mr. Chang and two men from the ministry came by tonight and took away some of her things.
02:30:06.163,02:30:08.165,As well as some things from your study.
02:30:12.294,02:30:13.337,Say nothing.
02:30:15.965,02:30:19.010,"If anyone asks, Mrs. Mak had an emergency and went back to Hong Kong."
02:30:24.557,02:30:25.725,What happened?
02:30:32.189,02:30:33.441,Go downstairs first.
02:30:34.233,02:30:35.317,Keep playing mahjong.
