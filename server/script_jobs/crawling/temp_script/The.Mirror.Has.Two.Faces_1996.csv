00:01:49.109,00:01:54.573,MEASURE AND SYMMETRY ARE BEAUTY AND VIRTUE THE WORLD OVER.

00:03:49.354,00:03:53.150,"HI. WHAT-- OH, NO, NOT AGAIN."
00:03:53.150,00:03:56.778,I THINK IT'S AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO SOMETHING I ATE.
00:03:56.778,00:04:00.866,"COME ON, COME ON, COME ON."
00:04:00.866,00:04:04.619,OOOHH!
00:04:04.619,00:04:07.998,IT'S THE THIRD TIME THIS MONTH.
00:04:07.998,00:04:11.085,"BARRY, PLEASE, DON'T THINK THAT. THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO THINK."
00:04:11.085,00:04:15.047,I'M GONNA BE BLACKLISTED AT EVERY RESTAURANT IN MANHATTAN FOR NOT KEEPING RESERVATIONS.
00:04:15.047,00:04:18.967,"WHY DON'T YOU CALL ME NEXT WEEK, OK?"
00:04:18.967,00:04:20.219,SURE.
00:04:20.219,00:04:21.762,FEEL BETTER.
00:04:21.762,00:04:23.304,THANK YOU.
00:04:23.304,00:04:27.101,BYE.
00:04:40.822,00:04:43.909,THINK I SHOULD START WITH A JOKE?
00:04:43.909,00:04:47.495,"OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS."
00:04:47.495,00:04:51.875,FOR WHAT?
00:04:47.495,00:05:02.677,"FOR YOU TO DEVELOP A SENSE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE AUTHOR OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH-- COLUMBIA'S VERY OWN PROFESSOR GREGORY LARKIN."
00:05:02.677,00:05:06.265,YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE.
00:05:10.393,00:05:12.813,THANK YOU.
00:05:12.813,00:05:15.565,I'M HONORED BY THIS WARM AND GRACIOUS WELCOME.
00:05:16.817,00:05:22.656,"AS I STAND HERE AT THE END OF A JOURNEY, I'M REMINDED OF SOMETHING DESCARTES ONCE SAID."
00:05:22.656,00:05:29.913,"FOR WHETHER I AM AWAKE OR ASLEEP, TWO AND THREE WILL ALWAYS MAKE FIVE, A SQUARE CAN NEVER HAVE MORE THAN FOUR SIDES..."
00:05:29.913,00:05:33.625,AND IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE THAT TRUTHS SO CLEAR AND APPARENT...
00:05:33.625,00:05:36.586,CAN BE SUSPECTED OF ANY UNCERTAINTY.
00:05:36.586,00:05:38.880,"UH, THIS BOOK..."
00:05:38.880,00:05:43.927,HAS TAKEN ME OVER 14 YEARS TO WRITE.
00:05:43.927,00:05:50.767,IT IS NOT WITHOUT A LITTLE SADNESS THAT I SAY GOOD-BYE TO IT CONSUMING MY DAYS AND NIGHTS.
00:05:52.435,00:05:55.605,"UH, AND NIGHTS. UM..."
00:05:55.605,00:05:59.193,"AND SO, UH..."

00:06:14.666,00:06:21.965,"UH...UH... I THOUGHT IT WOULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY, I-- I THOUGHT I WOULD KNOW MORE."
00:06:21.965,00:06:25.593,I DON'T.
00:06:25.593,00:06:30.724,REALLY.
00:06:30.724,00:06:32.851,COMING.
00:06:32.851,00:06:34.477,WHAT?
00:06:37.605,00:06:39.149,THANK--THANK YOU.
00:06:39.149,00:06:41.068,"OH, GOD, WHAT DID I SAY?"
00:06:41.068,00:06:46.156,"IT WAS FINE, ALTHOUGH I'D THINK TWICE ABOUT DOING VOLUNTEER WORK FOR A SUICIDE HOT LINE."
00:06:46.156,00:06:49.117,YOU WERE DOING OKAY UNTIL CANDICE WALKED IN.
00:06:49.117,00:06:51.619,"DON'T START, HENRY."
00:06:51.619,00:06:53.705,YOU SHOULD NEVER DRINK ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.
00:06:53.705,00:06:54.873,IT'S PERFECTLY NATURAL.
00:06:54.873,00:06:56.624,"SHE LEFT YOU, WHAT, A YEAR AGO?"
00:06:56.624,00:06:57.834,IT WAS THE STUPID WINE.
00:06:57.834,00:07:01.629,"AND THANK GOD CANDY LEFT WHEN SHE DID, OR I NEVER WOULD'VE FINISHED THE BOOK."
00:07:01.629,00:07:04.299,AND THANK GOD REBECCA LEFT AND CATHERINE AND ALLISON.
00:07:04.299,00:07:07.594,YOU'RE THE ONLY GUY I KNOW WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME.
00:07:07.594,00:07:09.263,WHY DOES EVERYTHING HAVE TO BE ABOUT SEX?
00:07:09.263,00:07:11.056,BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS ABOUT SEX.
00:07:11.056,00:07:15.810,"WHEN I'M WITH SOMEONE, WHEN I'M INVOLVED WITH THEM, I TEND TO GET A LITTLE SIDETRACKED."
00:07:15.810,00:07:20.107,"GREG, YOU CALL 14 YEARS TO WRITE A BOOK A LITTLE SIDETRACKED?"
00:07:20.107,00:07:22.067,I BET SHE'S STILL OUT THERE.
00:07:22.067,00:07:25.695,"IF I KNOW CANDICE, SHE'S OUT THERE."
00:07:22.067,00:07:28.448,"NO, NO, NO! HENRY-- YEAH."
00:07:28.448,00:07:31.201,"COME ON, FACE HER LIKE A GROWNUP."
00:07:31.201,00:07:34.037,"DO ME A FAVOR, HENRY."
00:07:34.037,00:07:36.164,"UH, SAY WE'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER."
00:07:36.164,00:07:38.708,WE ARE. IT MAY SEEM ODD NOT TO INVITE HER.
00:07:38.708,00:07:40.460,JUST DON'T LET ME GO HOME WITH HER.
00:07:40.460,00:07:43.671,"ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT."
00:07:43.671,00:07:45.090,PROFESSOR-- I'M SORRY.
00:07:45.090,00:07:46.674,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
00:07:46.674,00:07:49.719,"OH, IT WAS THAT STUPID WINE."
00:07:49.719,00:07:51.263,"HELLO, CANDICE."
00:07:51.263,00:07:52.639,HI.
00:07:52.639,00:07:54.308,YOU LOOK GREAT.
00:07:54.308,00:07:58.437,I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME JUST SHOWING UP LIKE THIS ON YOUR BIG NIGHT.
00:07:58.437,00:08:02.482,"IT'S JUST, UM..."
00:08:02.482,00:08:03.733,REALLY?
00:08:03.733,00:08:05.944,MM-HMM.
00:08:05.944,00:08:07.404,DO YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK?
00:08:07.404,00:08:09.656,"NO, NO, I'D BETTER NOT."
00:08:09.656,00:08:11.283,WANNA GRAB A BITE TO EAT?
00:08:11.283,00:08:13.410,"NO, I'M NOT HUNGRY."
00:08:13.410,00:08:15.329,WANT ME TO TAKE YOU HOME?
00:08:15.329,00:08:17.414,OKAY.
00:08:17.414,00:08:19.082,"GOOD TO SEE YOU, HENRY."
00:08:19.082,00:08:23.003,"BUT, GREG, YOU SAID-- BYE."
00:08:25.046,00:08:27.257,"CANDY, DON'T LEAVE."
00:08:27.257,00:08:29.592,"OH, THAT WAS GREAT."
00:08:29.592,00:08:32.887,"WELL, WE'RE DONE."
00:08:32.887,00:08:36.266,"GREG, I DUMPED YOU FOR ANOTHER MAN. HOW COULD YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME?"
00:08:36.266,00:08:39.269,"WELL-- BESIDES, I'M STILL SORT OF WITH PAUL."
00:08:39.269,00:08:40.770,I THOUGHT THAT WAS OVER.
00:08:40.770,00:08:42.439,"YEAH, WELL, HE WAS CHEATING ON ME."
00:08:42.439,00:08:46.318,I GUESS I JUST WANTED TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT MYSELF BEFORE I SEE HIM TOMORROW NIGHT.
00:08:46.318,00:08:49.904,TH-THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE?
00:08:49.904,00:08:51.614,"WELL, YEAH."
00:08:51.614,00:08:56.828,"LOOK, YOU WERE ALWAYS SUCH A NICE GUY, BUT LET'S FACE IT."
00:08:56.828,00:09:01.624,WE HAD NOTHING IN COMMON EXCEPT SEX AND THE FACT THAT YOU IDOLIZE ME.
00:09:01.624,00:09:04.627,UH-- I-I REALLY DO CARE FOR YOU.
00:09:04.627,00:09:08.215,REALLY. I JUST CAN'T WIND UP WITH YOU.
00:09:08.215,00:09:11.343,"WELL, CAN I--CAN I CALL YOU SOMETIME?"
00:09:12.344,00:09:15.138,What for?
00:09:23.313,00:09:24.605,"NO, I CANCELED."
00:09:24.605,00:09:26.691,"THREE BALLS, ONE STRIKE."
00:09:27.692,00:09:29.486,WHAT?
00:09:38.328,00:09:40.580,I HAD NO CHOICE.
00:09:40.580,00:09:45.460,WHAT IS THIS?
00:09:45.460,00:09:48.922,LOOK AT THIS.
00:10:05.313,00:10:10.902,WE'RE THE GIRLS OF 1-400-HOT-TALK.
00:10:10.902,00:10:12.862,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:10:10.902,00:10:16.074,"THERE'S BRIANA, TINA, MARLA AND ME, FELICIA."
00:10:16.074,00:10:19.160,ANYTHING YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT.
00:10:19.160,00:10:23.248,CALL ME. CALL ME.
00:10:23.248,00:10:28.878,I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.
00:10:28.878,00:10:31.798,"TONIGHT, DARLING?"
00:10:31.798,00:10:33.508,YEAH.
00:10:33.508,00:10:37.596,"MMM, SO AM I."
00:10:37.596,00:10:41.600,"UH, NOTHING SPECIAL."
00:10:41.600,00:10:44.727,WANNA KNOW WHAT I'M WEARING?
00:10:41.600,00:10:49.524,NO-- I WAS DRYING MYSELF OFF AFTER A HOT SHOWER WHEN YOU CALLED-- FE-FELICIA? FELICIA?
00:10:49.524,00:10:51.734,WHY DO WOMEN LEAVE?
00:10:51.734,00:10:53.236,WHAT?
00:10:53.236,00:10:54.988,WHY DO WOMEN LEAVE?
00:10:54.988,00:10:56.281,ESPECIALLY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.
00:10:56.281,00:10:59.200,I CAN'T GO THROUGH THIS ANYMORE.
00:10:59.200,00:11:02.912,LIFE IS VERY COMPLEX.
00:11:02.912,00:11:05.165,THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES.
00:11:05.165,00:11:07.125,WHY SHOULD THAT BE?
00:11:07.125,00:11:11.712,"THE MATHEMATICAL WORLD IS COMPLETELY RATIONAL, UNCOMPLICATED BY SEX."
00:11:11.712,00:11:16.759,"YOU THINK TOO MUCH, HON."
00:11:16.759,00:11:21.848,I--I-- I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY LIFE WITH SOMEONE...
00:11:21.848,00:11:25.101,SOMEONE I'M NOT SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO.
00:11:25.101,00:11:26.561,WHAT?
00:11:26.561,00:11:39.491,"HOW CAN TWO PEOPLE COME TOGETHER FOR WHAT'S A LASTING AND SUBSTANTIAL MUTUAL RESPECT, GENUINE AFFECTION, IN A WORLD THAT'S RUN BY AD AGENCIES SELLING GREAT SEX-- TAKE OUT YOUR OWN AD, I GUESS."
00:11:39.491,00:11:41.493,AN AD?
00:11:41.493,00:11:43.036,MM-HMM.
00:11:49.125,00:11:50.544,HMM.
00:11:52.379,00:11:53.712,YEAH.
00:11:58.468,00:12:03.014,...AND BE OVER THIRTY-FIVE.
00:12:07.101,00:12:10.605,...NOT...IMPORTANT.
00:12:15.360,00:12:18.405,LOOK AT ME. I'M A GROWN WOMAN WEARING A PROM DRESS.
00:12:18.405,00:12:20.281,YOU ARE NOT.
00:12:20.281,00:12:22.617,ADORABLE? I LOOK LIKE AN OVER-THE-HILL BARBIE DOLL.
00:12:22.617,00:12:24.202,IT DOESN'T FIT RIGHT.
00:12:24.202,00:12:25.828,TOO MANY SNOW BALLS.
00:12:25.828,00:12:28.206,WHY DIDN'T YOU PICK OUT SOMETHING LOOSER IN MY COLOR?
00:12:28.206,00:12:30.166,BECAUSE MAIDS OF HONOR DON'T WEAR BLACK.
00:12:30.166,00:12:32.085,IT WOULD HELP IF YOU FIXED YOURSELF UP A LITTLE.
00:12:32.085,00:12:33.628,WHY DIDN'T YOU WEAR SOME MAKEUP?
00:12:33.628,00:12:35.547,I AM WEARING MAKEUP.
00:12:35.547,00:12:37.924,OH. LET'S GO.
00:12:37.924,00:12:41.760,I LIKE IT. THE CURLS WORK.
00:12:41.760,00:12:44.763,LIKE SHIRLEY TEMPLE ON CRACK.
00:12:44.763,00:12:47.183,WHERE THE HELL IS SHE?
00:12:47.183,00:12:49.352,I KNEW SHE WOULD PULL SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
00:12:49.352,00:12:52.564,SHE CAN'T STAND THE FACT THAT I'M THE ONE GETTING ALL THE ATTENTION TODAY.
00:12:52.564,00:12:54.899,WE SHOULD'VE HAD HER COMMITTED WHEN SHE TURNED 60.
00:12:54.899,00:12:58.570,CLAIRE. YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEONE COMMITTED FOR EXCESSIVE VANITY.
00:12:58.570,00:13:03.491,"THANK YOU, ROSE."
00:13:03.491,00:13:06.620,I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO WEAR MAKEUP TODAY.
00:13:06.620,00:13:08.329,I AM WEARING MAKEUP.
00:13:08.329,00:13:13.460,"OH, MY GOD."
00:13:13.460,00:13:15.378,THIS HAPPENS TO BE AN IMITATION SCAASI.
00:13:15.378,00:13:18.339,"YOU'RE THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE, NOT THE OPENING ACT."
00:13:18.339,00:13:20.133,FINE. I'LL GO HOME AND CHANGE.
00:13:20.133,00:13:23.428,"OH, STOP IT. WE'RE LATE ALREADY."
00:13:23.428,00:13:26.847,"ALL CELIBATES SWEAT, DEAR. IF THEY DIDN'T, THEY'D EXPLODE."
00:13:26.847,00:13:29.601,I JUST WENT TO BUY MYSELF A LITTLE SNACK.
00:13:29.601,00:13:33.772,I CAN'T SIT THROUGH THIS GANTSEH MEGILLEH WITHOUT EATING SOMETHING. I'LL PASS OUT.
00:13:33.772,00:13:35.523,IT'LL ONLY TAKE 45 MINUTES.
00:13:35.523,00:13:37.858,IT'LL FEEL LIKE TWO HOURS.
00:13:35.523,00:13:39.736,NOT TO MENTION THAT YOU'RE MARRYING OUTSIDE YOUR FAITH AND ON THE SABBATH.
00:13:39.736,00:13:44.198,"OH, MOTHER, THE ONLY THING YOU EVER TAUGHT ME ABOUT THE SABBATH IS BERGDORF'S WOULDN'T BE AS CROWDED."
00:13:44.198,00:13:46.326,NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME.
00:13:46.326,00:13:49.663,"I WANT YOU TO GET OUT THERE, AND I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER TODAY IS MY DAY."
00:13:49.663,00:13:55.251,"IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE YOURSELF, I'M GOING TO HAVE YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE BLOWN UP AS A CHRISTMAS CARD."
00:13:55.251,00:13:58.505,I SHOULD HAVE NEVER ENCOURAGED YOU TO SPEAK.
00:14:04.636,00:14:07.013,"IS IT POSSIBLE-- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT."
00:14:09.516,00:14:12.268,MAYBE SHE'LL LOOK BACK AND TURN INTO A PILLAR OF SALT.
00:14:13.852,00:14:17.190,"SO, HANNAH LOOKS PRETTY GOOD FOR HER AGE."
00:14:17.190,00:14:19.651,ALEX LOOKS NERVOUS.
00:14:21.027,00:14:25.198,"OH, GOD, I HOPE I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING."
00:14:25.198,00:14:26.741,I THINK YOU ARE.
00:14:28.868,00:14:31.830,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE PARTY IS ABOUT TO GET STARTED."
00:14:31.830,00:14:35.375,THE DANCE FLOOR IS ALL YOURS.
00:14:35.375,00:14:38.461,"OKAY, GIRLS, LICK YOUR LIPS."
00:14:38.461,00:14:42.799,"OH, YEAH! TAKE ME ON!"
00:14:42.799,00:14:45.552,IT'S GOOD TO SEE YA.
00:14:45.552,00:14:48.221,YOUR HUSBAND'S A LUCKY GUY.
00:14:50.515,00:14:53.768,WAITER! CAN WE GET MORE DRESSING?
00:14:53.768,00:14:56.187,SURE.
00:14:56.187,00:14:58.272,"TWO MORE DRINKS, WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE PLEASE."
00:14:58.272,00:14:59.566,THAT WOULD BE NICE.
00:14:59.566,00:15:02.026,THIS LOOKS DELICIOUS.
00:15:02.026,00:15:07.198,SOMETHING A LITTLE ROMANTIC FOR ALL THE LOVERS IN THE HOUSE.
00:15:07.198,00:15:09.075,I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S MARRIED.
00:15:09.075,00:15:11.035,I CAN'T BELIEVE HE CHOSE CLAIRE OVER YOU.
00:15:12.161,00:15:14.080,I TOLD YOU NOT TO INTRODUCE THEM.
00:15:14.080,00:15:16.541,"WELL, SHE ALREADY HAD A HUSBAND."
00:15:16.541,00:15:19.335,UH-HUH.
00:15:19.335,00:15:20.879,"SO, HOW ARE YOU HANDLING ALL THIS?"
00:15:20.879,00:15:22.589,I'VE LEARNED MY LESSON.
00:15:22.589,00:15:25.383,NO MORE FANTASIES ABOUT GOOD-LOOKING MEN.
00:15:25.383,00:15:26.967,YOU NEVER KNOW.
00:15:25.383,00:15:28.762,THERE'S A GUY OUT THERE SOMEWHERE FOR YOU.
00:15:28.762,00:15:30.346,"WHO, BARRY NEUFELD?"
00:15:30.346,00:15:33.725,"SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?"
00:15:33.725,00:15:37.771,BESIDES THE FACT HE LOOKS LIKE GUMPY AND HE IRRITATES THE HELL OUT OF YOU.
00:15:37.771,00:15:40.981,GUMBY!
00:15:42.734,00:15:45.528,"AH, WHY SHOULD THAT MATTER?"
00:15:45.528,00:15:49.323,DON'T SAY THAT.
00:15:49.323,00:15:52.201,"THE TRUTH IS, I THINK I'VE JUST REACHED THE POINT."
00:15:52.201,00:15:55.162,WHAT POINT?
00:15:55.162,00:15:58.207,MARRIED?
00:15:58.207,00:16:02.754,"OH, COME ON."
00:16:02.754,00:16:05.632,"NO, IT CAN BE MORE THAN THAT."
00:16:05.632,00:16:08.760,I TELL YOU WHAT I ENVY ABOUT PEOPLE IN LOVE.
00:16:08.760,00:16:10.762,YEAH?
00:16:08.760,00:16:15.349,"I'D LOVE IT IF SOMEONE KNEW ME, REALLY KNEW ME..."
00:16:15.349,00:16:18.352,"WHAT I LIKE, WHAT I'M AFRAID OF..."
00:16:18.352,00:16:22.106,WHAT KIND OF TOOTHPASTE I USE.
00:16:22.106,00:16:25.985,I THINK THAT...
00:16:25.985,00:16:28.947,"HEY, HEY, HEY, SISTER-IN-LAW..."
00:16:28.947,00:16:30.698,MM-MUH. YOU HAVIN' A GOOD TIME HERE?
00:16:30.698,00:16:32.492,YEAH.
00:16:32.492,00:16:37.246,IN HONOR OF THE BRIDE'S FAMILY-- HAVE YOU SEEN CLAIRE?
00:16:37.246,00:16:38.498,I'LL GO FIND HER FOR YOU.
00:16:38.498,00:16:41.459,THANK YOU. YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT.
00:16:41.459,00:16:42.836,RIGHT.
00:16:42.836,00:16:44.921,I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT.
00:16:42.836,00:16:46.422,YOU REALLY LOOK-- I HEARD YOU.
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.551,WHY DON'T YOU HAVE SOME COFFEE?
00:16:50.551,00:16:53.888,I'LL GO FIND CLAIRE.
00:16:53.888,00:16:55.473,MMM.
00:16:55.473,00:16:58.392,"CLAIRE, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"
00:16:58.392,00:17:00.812,"OH, BROTHER."
00:17:00.812,00:17:02.605,TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF HER.
00:17:02.605,00:17:04.649,HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
00:17:04.649,00:17:06.985,I MAY NEVER FORGIVE YOU.
00:17:19.079,00:17:20.373,HMM.
00:17:33.386,00:17:34.679,HMM.
00:17:47.650,00:17:49.318,HMM!
00:17:50.695,00:17:55.825,"MMM, YES. OHH, YES."
00:17:55.825,00:17:58.870,OHH. MMM.
00:17:58.870,00:18:02.415,I-I'M PROFESSOR GREGORY LARKIN.
00:18:02.415,00:18:06.252,"I'M CALLING ABOUT THE, UH, RESPONSE TO MY AD."
00:18:06.252,00:18:08.254,IS THIS PROFESSOR MORGAN?
00:18:08.254,00:18:11.966,"NO, THIS IS HER SISTER."
00:18:11.966,00:18:14.260,"OH, WELL, THEN MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING."
00:18:14.260,00:18:17.263,"OH, NO, PLEASE."
00:18:17.263,00:18:20.808,SOME OF THESE GUYS ARE SUCH CREEPS AND LOSERS.
00:18:20.808,00:18:24.144,"UM, BUT WHEN IT SAID YOU TAUGHT AT COLUMBIA..."
00:18:24.144,00:18:27.231,SOMETHING JUST CLICKED INSIDE.
00:18:27.231,00:18:30.610,"NOW, YOU HAVE SEEN HER PICTURE, RIGHT?"
00:18:30.610,00:18:31.903,YES.
00:18:31.903,00:18:33.404,AND?
00:18:33.404,00:18:35.865,AND WHAT?
00:18:35.865,00:18:38.367,NOTHING. GREAT.
00:19:01.891,00:19:05.061,"AT MY SISTER'S WEDDING, RIGHT?"
00:19:05.061,00:19:10.399,"THERE SHE IS, GETTING DRUNK, REGRETTING SHE EVER GOT MARRIED-- FOR THE THIRD TIME, MIND YOU."
00:19:10.399,00:19:15.195,"UM, MY MOTHER IS SO JEALOUS SHE IS SPROUTING SNAKES FROM HER HAIR."
00:19:15.195,00:19:17.531,"AND I'M THINKING, THIS IS PERFECT."
00:19:17.531,00:19:24.789,WE'VE GOT THREE FEMININE ARCHETYPES HERE: THE DIVINE WHORE-- EXCUSE ME-- MEDUSA AND ME.
00:19:24.789,00:19:27.917,WHO AM I?
00:19:27.917,00:19:30.294,THE VIRGIN MARY?
00:19:30.294,00:19:33.339,"THANKS A LOT, TREVOR."
00:19:33.339,00:19:37.259,"NO, THE FAITHFUL HANDMAIDEN."
00:19:33.339,00:19:40.262,"ALWAYS THE BRIDESMAID, NEVER THE BRIDE."
00:19:40.262,00:19:47.436,"IT DOES PROVE, HOWEVER, WHAT JUNG SAID ALL ALONG: THAT MYTHS AND ARCHETYPES ARE ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN MY APARTMENT."
00:19:49.313,00:19:57.321,"AS I STOOD AT THE ALTAR BESIDE MY SISTER AND HER HUSBAND-TO-BE, IT STRUCK ME THAT THIS RITUAL..."
00:19:57.321,00:19:59.949,CALLED A WEDDING CEREMONY...
00:19:59.949,00:20:03.119,IS REALLY JUST THE FINAL SCENE OF A FAIRY TALE.
00:20:03.119,00:20:05.579,THEY NEVER TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS AFTER.
00:20:05.579,00:20:10.209,THEY NEVER TELL YOU THAT CINDERELLA DROVE THE PRINCE CRAZY WITH HER OBSESSIVE NEED TO CLEAN THE CASTLE.
00:20:12.419,00:20:14.588,"OR SHE MISSED HER DAY JOB, RIGHT?"
00:20:14.588,00:20:19.093,"NO, THEY DON'T TELL US WHAT HAPPENS AFTER BECAUSE THERE IS NO AFTER."
00:20:19.093,00:20:24.015,THE BE-ALL AND THE END-ALL OF ROMANTIC LOVE WAS-- MIKE?
00:20:24.015,00:20:28.227,"UH, SEX?"
00:20:28.227,00:20:29.520,"RIGHT, YES."
00:20:31.271,00:20:33.691,"MARRIAGE, THAT'S RIGHT."
00:20:33.691,00:20:40.907,"AROUND THE 12th CENTURY, THERE WAS A NOTION KNOWN AS COURTLY LOVE, WHERE LOVE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MARRIAGE AND NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX."
00:20:40.907,00:20:48.497,IN MOST CASES IT WAS DEFINED AS A PASSIONATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A KNIGHT AND A LADY OF THE COURT WHO WAS ALREADY MARRIED.
00:20:48.497,00:20:51.959,"AND SO, THEY COULD NEVER CONSUMMATE THEIR LOVE."
00:20:51.959,00:21:00.009,"IN THIS WAY THEY WOULD HAVE TO RISE ABOVE YOUR ORDINARY, UH, YOU KNOW, GOING TO THE BATHROOM IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER KIND OF LOVE, RIGHT?"
00:21:00.009,00:21:05.890,AND THEY WOULD GO AFTER SOMETHING MORE DIVINE.
00:21:05.890,00:21:12.271,"THEY TOOK SEX OUT OF THE EQUATION, AND WHAT WAS LEFT WAS A UNION OF SOULS."
00:21:12.271,00:21:17.568,"NOW, THINK OF THIS: SEX WAS ALWAYS THE FATAL LOVE POTION."
00:21:17.568,00:21:20.947,LOOK AT THE LITERATURE OF THE TIME.
00:21:20.947,00:21:24.324,TRISTAN AND ISOLDE.
00:21:20.947,00:21:27.120,"ALL CONSUMMATION COULD LEAD TO WAS MADNESS, DESPAIR, OR DEATH."
00:21:27.120,00:21:42.468,"CLINICAL EXPERTS, SCHOLARS AND MY AUNT ESTHER ARE UNITED IN THE BELIEF THAT TRUE LOVE HAS SPIRITUAL DIMENSIONS, WHILE ROMANTIC LOVE IS NOTHING BUT A LIE, AN ILLUSION, A MODERN MYTH, A SOULLESS MANIPULATION."
00:21:42.468,00:21:54.521,"SPEAKING OF MANIPULATION, IT'S LIKE GOING TO THE MOVIES, AND WE SEE THE LOVERS ON SCREEN KISS, AND THE MUSIC SWELLS, AND WE BUY IT, RIGHT?"
00:21:54.521,00:21:59.443,"SO WHEN MY DATE TAKES ME HOME AND KISSES ME GOOD NIGHT, IF I DON'T HEAR THE PHILHARMONIC IN MY HEAD, I DUMP HIM."
00:22:02.655,00:22:06.450,"NOW, THE QUESTION IS, WHY DO WE BUY IT?"
00:22:06.450,00:22:13.415,"WE BUY IT BECAUSE WHETHER IT'S A MYTH OR A MANIPULATION, LET'S FACE IT, WE ALL WANT TO FALL IN LOVE, RIGHT?"
00:22:13.415,00:22:21.674,"WHY? BECAUSE THAT EXPERIENCE MAKES US FEEL COMPLETELY ALIVE, WHERE EVERY SENSE IS HEIGHTENED, EVERY EMOTION IS MAGNIFIED."
00:22:21.674,00:22:26.595,OUR EVERYDAY REALITY IS SHATTERED AND WE ARE FLUNG INTO THE HEAVENS.
00:22:26.595,00:22:36.438,"IT MAY ONLY LAST A MOMENT, AN HOUR, AN AFTERNOON, BUT THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH ITS VALUE, BECAUSE WE'RE LEFT WITH MEMORIES THAT WE TREASURE FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES."
00:22:36.438,00:22:43.361,"I READ AN ARTICLE A WHILE AGO THAT SAID, WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE, WE HEAR PUCCINI IN OUR HEADS."
00:22:43.361,00:22:45.323,I LOVE THAT.
00:22:45.323,00:22:52.454,I THINK IT'S BECAUSE HIS MUSIC FULLY EXPRESSES OUR LONGING FOR PASSION IN OUR LIVES AND ROMANTIC LOVE.
00:22:52.454,00:23:03.216,"AND WHILE WE'RE LISTENING TO LA BOHEME OR TURANDOT OR READING WUTHERING HEIGHTS OR WATCHING CASABLANCA, A LITTLE BIT OF THAT LOVE LIVES IN US, TOO."
00:23:03.216,00:23:12.390,"SO, THE FINAL QUESTION IS: WHY DO PEOPLE WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WHEN IT CAN HAVE SUCH A SHORT SHELF-LIFE AND BE DEVASTATINGLY PAINFUL?"
00:23:12.390,00:23:13.726,WHAT DO YOU THINK? STACIE?
00:23:13.726,00:23:15.435,IT LEADS TO PROPAGATION OF THE SPECIES?
00:23:15.435,00:23:16.979,MM-HMM. RANDY?
00:23:16.979,00:23:19.357,"PSYCHOLOGICALLY, WE NEED TO CONNECT WITH SOMEBODY."
00:23:19.357,00:23:20.733,COULD BE. JILL?
00:23:20.733,00:23:22.651,BECAUSE WE'RE CULTURALLY PRECONDITIONED?
00:23:22.651,00:23:26.864,"GOOD ANSWERS, BUT MUCH TOO INTELLECTUAL FOR ME."
00:23:26.864,00:23:36.290,"I THINK IT'S BECAUSE-- AS SOME OF YOU ALREADY MAY KNOW-- WHILE IT DOES LAST, IT FEELS REALLY GREAT, THAT'S WHY."
00:23:37.499,00:23:40.127,RIGHT?
00:23:42.462,00:23:46.466,THANKS. THANK YOU.
00:23:58.562,00:24:01.815,"I'M HALFWAY THROUGH MY MEAL, AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET."
00:24:01.815,00:24:05.569,THE PERFECT BITE.
00:24:08.197,00:24:09.615,MMM!
00:24:11.325,00:24:12.868,MMM!
00:24:12.868,00:24:15.037,YOU NEED A THERAPIST.
00:24:18.707,00:24:20.584,"OH, ROSE, DO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE TELEVISION ON?"
00:24:20.584,00:24:23.379,CAN'T WE HAVE A CIVILIZED CONVERSATION?
00:24:23.379,00:24:27.300,I KNOW I'M NOT AS INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING AS SOME OF YOUR UNIVERSITY PEOPLE.
00:24:27.300,00:24:31.887,ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I'M SORRY.
00:24:47.653,00:24:49.571,ALL RIGHT.
00:24:49.571,00:24:53.242,YOU HAVEN'T EVEN NOTICED I'VE HAD MY HAIR DONE DIFFERENTLY.
00:24:53.242,00:24:57.746,"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH."
00:24:57.746,00:24:59.832,"MM-HMM, MM-HMM."
00:24:59.832,00:25:03.169,WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT IT?
00:25:05.671,00:25:07.089,"THE, UM..."
00:25:08.548,00:25:10.759,THERE'S NOTHING DIFFERENT ABOUT IT.
00:25:10.759,00:25:13.887,YOU'RE JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER-- SO EASY TO TRIP UP.
00:25:18.684,00:25:20.478,"SO, UH..."
00:25:20.478,00:25:22.355,HOW...HOW IS WORK?
00:25:22.355,00:25:25.024,SAME AS ALWAYS.
00:25:25.024,00:25:27.693,"ALTHOUGH, I HAD ONE CUSTOMER COME IN LOOKING FOR A MAKEOVER."
00:25:27.693,00:25:29.736,SHE NEEDED ONE.
00:25:29.736,00:25:33.991,"DYED BLOND HAIR, BLUE EYE SHADOW, ASH-BROWN FOUNDATION."
00:25:33.991,00:25:35.742,HIDEOUS.
00:25:35.742,00:25:39.079,"ANYWAY, SHE WAS SHOCKED WHEN SHE FOUND OUT HOW OLD I WAS."
00:25:39.079,00:25:41.457,OH? HOW OLD WERE YOU?
00:25:45.127,00:25:46.879,SORRY.
00:25:48.172,00:25:50.257,I RAN INTO MR. JENKINS AGAIN.
00:25:50.257,00:25:52.759,"OH, YEAH?"
00:25:52.759,00:25:56.472,HE WANTS TO TAKE ME TO SOME ALZHEIMER'S BENEFIT.
00:25:58.640,00:26:01.685,I CAN'T BELIEVE HE STILL ASKS YOU AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.
00:26:01.685,00:26:04.646,WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HIM SOMETIME?
00:26:04.646,00:26:08.025,THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.
00:26:08.025,00:26:11.820,THAT'S MY LIFE.
00:26:11.820,00:26:14.740,"BESIDES, HE KNOWS MY SITUATION WITH YOU."
00:26:17.451,00:26:20.329,YOU'RE NOT SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF ME?
00:26:20.329,00:26:25.000,HOW WOULD IT LOOK?
00:26:25.000,00:26:27.461,MOM...
00:26:27.461,00:26:30.256,WHO'S LOOKING?
00:26:57.783,00:26:59.535,HELLO.
00:26:59.535,00:27:01.995,"YES, IS PROFESSOR LARKIN THERE?"
00:27:01.995,00:27:04.331,"UH, I MEAN, IS PROFESSOR MORGAN THERE?"
00:27:04.331,00:27:07.585,BARELY. WHO'S THIS?
00:27:07.585,00:27:09.503,THIS IS GREGORY LARKIN.
00:27:09.503,00:27:15.801,I'M A PROFESSOR AT THE-- IN THE MATH DEPARTMENT AT COLUMBIA.
00:27:15.801,00:27:22.349,"I WAS JUST, UH, CALLING TO SEE, UH-- WHAT?"

00:27:28.855,00:27:32.985,FINE.
00:27:37.990,00:27:41.160,I HOPE IT WASN'T PRESUMPTUOUS OF ME...
00:27:41.160,00:27:43.745,BUT I SAT IN ON ONE OF YOUR CLASSES.
00:27:45.663,00:27:49.667,I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE DINNER.
00:27:49.667,00:27:54.798,"HOLD ON. COULD YOU TALK LOUDER, PLEASE?"
00:27:54.798,00:27:57.009,I SAT IN ON YOUR CLASS TODAY.
00:27:57.009,00:27:59.428,HOLD ON A MINUTE.
00:27:59.428,00:28:03.182,I WAS IMPRESSED WITH YOUR TEACHING. I WAS HOPING WE COULD HAVE DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT.
00:28:07.603,00:28:09.647,I CAN DO THIS.
00:28:10.814,00:28:13.651,HELLO?

00:28:17.321,00:28:20.157,"YOU'RE A MATH TEACHER, AND YOU WANNA EAT DINNER."
00:28:20.157,00:28:23.536,I SAT IN ON ONE OF YOUR CLASSES.
00:28:23.536,00:28:25.120,BE QUIET.
00:28:25.120,00:28:26.955,"NO, NOT YOU."
00:28:26.955,00:28:28.248,I DON'T KNOW!
00:28:28.248,00:28:32.919,"GREGORY LARKIN, MATH DEPARTMENT, COLUMBIA."
00:28:50.979,00:28:58.987,"OF IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION IS OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS COMPLEX, UH, BUT IN REALITY IT IS QUITE SIMPLE."
00:28:58.987,00:29:02.032,IT'S SIMPLY A MATTER OF PRETENDING...
00:29:02.032,00:29:05.452,THAT Y IS A FUNCTION OF X.
00:29:05.452,00:29:12.501,"AND SO, UM-- MMM. UH."
00:29:12.501,00:29:14.628,"OH, HI."
00:29:14.628,00:29:16.796,I SAW YOU PASS BY.
00:29:16.796,00:29:20.551,"YEAH, I WAS JUST PASSING BY, AND, UH-- UH..."
00:29:20.551,00:29:23.512,I'M SORRY ABOUT CALLING THE OTHER NIGHT.
00:29:23.512,00:29:31.811,"I HOPE I DIDN'T DISTURB YOU. UH-- I WAS SO CONFUSED, I-- SO, UH, ARE WE ON FOR SATURDAY NIGHT?"
00:29:31.811,00:29:33.689,SURE.
00:29:33.689,00:29:36.233,HMM. MOI AUSSI.
00:29:37.401,00:29:38.777,HMM.
00:29:41.029,00:29:42.364,OHH!
00:29:43.073,00:29:44.366,WHEW!
00:29:44.366,00:29:48.078,"SO, THIS ONE MUST BE VERY GOOD-LOOKING FOR YOU TO GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE."
00:29:48.078,00:29:49.580,"OH, I HATE LIPSTICK."
00:29:49.580,00:29:50.997,THAT'S NOT A GOOD COLOR FOR YOU.
00:29:50.997,00:29:52.874,DID YOU TRY THE SAMPLES I BROUGHT HOME?
00:29:52.874,00:29:55.127,DOESN'T MATTER.
00:29:55.127,00:29:56.920,"OH, UH, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO FOR DINNER?"
00:29:56.920,00:29:58.589,I DON'T CARE ABOUT DINNER.
00:29:58.589,00:30:00.840,CAN'T YOU SEE THAT I'M UPSET?
00:30:00.840,00:30:04.052,YOU'RE ALWAYS SO RELIEVED WHEN YOU CANCEL YOUR DATES.
00:30:04.052,00:30:07.055,WE'RE JUST AGREEING TO EAT AT THE SAME TABLE.
00:30:07.055,00:30:10.100,HOW YOU LOOK UNLESS YOU THINK SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN WITH THIS ONE?
00:30:10.100,00:30:13.520,STOP CALLING HIM THIS ONE.
00:30:13.520,00:30:15.939,NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
00:30:15.939,00:30:18.066,YOU NEED MORE COLOR.
00:30:18.066,00:30:20.026,YES. SIT DOWN AND LET ME DO IT.
00:30:20.026,00:30:22.488,ALL RIGHT.
00:30:22.488,00:30:26.325,NO. YOU WON'T LOOK LIKE A CLOWN.
00:30:26.325,00:30:28.827,HERE. DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING BEFORE I LEAVE?
00:30:28.827,00:30:32.539,IT'S NOT SUCH A BAD THING TO KEEP A MAN WAITING.
00:30:30.454,00:30:34.958,YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK HE'S THE ONLY DATE YOU'VE HAD IN YEARS.
00:30:34.958,00:30:36.835,GIVE ME THE BOW.
00:30:36.835,00:30:39.838,"HI, EDDIE."
00:30:39.838,00:30:42.215,LOOKS TERRIFIC.
00:30:42.215,00:30:44.092,"NO, I'M FINE."
00:30:44.092,00:30:48.180,"OOH, GOOD! SIR!"
00:30:49.973,00:30:53.977,HEY! WHAT?
00:30:55.979,00:31:01.193,SORRY!
00:31:01.193,00:31:03.195,HELLO!
00:31:10.327,00:31:11.995,HERE'S WHERE I'M GOING.
00:31:11.995,00:31:14.790,BUT DON'T GO UNTIL I PUT UP YOUR WINDOW.
00:31:14.790,00:31:19.586,"OH, NO! NO! MY HAIR!"
00:31:19.586,00:31:23.006,DON'T COMPLAIN TO ME.
00:31:23.006,00:31:25.718,HOW DO YOU DRIVE WITH BROKEN WINDOWS?
00:31:32.224,00:31:34.476,UHH!
00:31:34.476,00:31:39.773,HI! HI.
00:31:39.773,00:31:41.983,SORRY? APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT?
00:31:41.983,00:31:43.861,I MEANT MY HAIR.
00:31:43.861,00:31:46.697,I MUST LOOK LIKE I WAS ATTACKED BY WOLVES.
00:31:46.697,00:31:49.241,"OH, WELL, THEN I APOLOGIZE, I-- MMM."
00:31:49.241,00:31:50.701,I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
00:31:50.701,00:31:53.953,"UM...AH, YEAH, WELL..."
00:31:53.953,00:31:58.041,COULD YOU EXCUSE ME WHILE I JUST GO TO THE LADIES ROOM FOR JUST A MINUTE?
00:31:58.041,00:32:00.168,SURE. SURE.
00:32:04.964,00:32:07.217,"UH, YOU ENJOY DANCING?"
00:32:07.217,00:32:11.638,I USED TO LOVE TO DANCE WITH MY FATHER.
00:32:11.638,00:32:15.016,YOU?
00:32:15.016,00:32:17.060,REALLY?
00:32:17.060,00:32:19.020,OH. THANK YOU.
00:32:19.020,00:32:20.980,MM-HMM.
00:32:20.980,00:32:23.233,WATCHING?
00:32:23.233,00:32:29.072,IT'S INTERESTING HOW COUPLING APPEARS ALL THROUGHOUT NATURE AND IN MATHEMATICS.
00:32:29.072,00:32:32.492,"MMM. OH, YOU WERE TELLING ME SOMETHING ABOUT PAIRS."
00:32:32.492,00:32:34.369,"OH, THE TWIN PRIME CONJECTURE."
00:32:34.369,00:32:41.084,"YES, WELL, IT EXPLORES PAIRS OF PRIME NUMBERS; UH, NUMBERS THAT ARE ONLY DIVISIBLE BY THEMSELVES."
00:32:41.084,00:32:48.174,"THREE-FIVE, UH, FIVE-SEVEN. NOT SEVEN-NINE, BECAUSE-- NINE CAN BE DIVIDED BY THREE."
00:32:48.174,00:32:52.930,TH-THAT'S RIGHT.
00:32:52.930,00:32:55.808,"THEN YOU HAVE 11-13, 17-19 AND SO ON."
00:32:55.808,00:32:59.144,AND WHAT WAS DISCOVERED WAS THAT WHAT OFTEN OCCURRED...
00:32:59.144,00:33:04.524,"WERE PAIRS SEPARATED BY, UH-- ONE NUMBER IN BETWEEN."
00:33:04.524,00:33:08.194,EXACTLY! EXACTLY!
00:33:08.194,00:33:11.030,"UH, DID YOU READ MY BOOK?"
00:33:11.030,00:33:12.783,"NO, I'M SORRY."
00:33:12.783,00:33:16.995,"NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT."
00:33:16.995,00:33:19.998,FIRST DATE WHERE I FEEL LIKE I'M WINNING ON A GAME SHOW.
00:33:19.998,00:33:21.750,"OH, I'M SORRY."
00:33:21.750,00:33:24.127,"OH, I'M SORRY."
00:33:24.127,00:33:29.132,"NO, IT'S JUST SO RARE THAT I MEET A PERSON THAT I CAN DISCUSS THESE THINGS WITH."
00:33:29.132,00:33:35.681,"REALLY? IT JUST SOUNDS KIND OF ODD-- IT'S, UH-- SOME PEPPER?"
00:33:35.681,00:33:39.643,"WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, CAN YOU BRING ME A LITTLE SIDE DISH OF EXTRA DRESSING, PLEASE?"
00:33:39.643,00:33:41.728,CERTAINLY.
00:33:41.728,00:33:45.315,I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE SALAD. I JUST LIKE THE DRESSING.
00:33:45.315,00:33:46.692,AH.
00:33:46.692,00:33:50.487,THIS TWIN PRIME CONJECTURE IS INTERESTING.
00:33:50.487,00:33:53.615,WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU COUNTED PAST A MILLION?
00:33:53.615,00:33:56.493,WOULD THERE STILL BE PAIRS LIKE THAT?
00:33:56.493,00:34:02.791,"CAN'T BELIEVE YOU-- YOU THOUGHT OF THAT. UM, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS YET TO BE PROVEN IN THE TWIN PRIME CONJECTURE."
00:34:02.791,00:34:05.585,REALLY?
00:34:05.585,00:34:09.088,"I HAVE, UM, THESE TICKETS FOR A CONCERT NEXT SATURDAY."
00:34:09.088,00:34:11.842,I WAS WONDERING IF WE COULD DO THIS AGAIN.
00:34:13.051,00:34:14.761,SURE.
00:34:14.761,00:34:18.390,GREAT. TERRIFIC.
00:34:18.390,00:34:22.936,WHAT WAS IT YOU WANTED TO DISCUSS ABOUT MY TEACHING?
00:34:22.936,00:34:28.316,"OH, UM...WELL, UH, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE."
00:34:28.316,00:34:32.738,THAT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE TO MEET YOU.
00:34:32.738,00:34:34.364,MIND?
00:34:34.364,00:34:37.242,NOT THAT I DIDN'T FIND YOUR CLASS FASCINATING.
00:34:37.242,00:34:42.455,"IN FACT, I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, THE FIRST OF WHICH IS..."
00:34:42.455,00:34:44.541,H-H-HOW DO YOU GET THEM TO STAY?
00:34:56.011,00:35:00.265,NOTHING.
00:35:01.934,00:35:03.351,DON'T ASK.
00:35:05.103,00:35:07.606,YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE HIM AGAIN?
00:35:07.606,00:35:09.900,"NO, WE'RE GOIN' OUT NEXT WEEK."
00:35:09.900,00:35:12.193,"SO, HE MUST LIKE YOU."
00:35:13.528,00:35:15.697,MMM.
00:35:15.697,00:35:17.783,DID HE KISS YOU?
00:35:19.701,00:35:22.245,NO.
00:35:22.245,00:35:25.540,"IT'S KIND OF SWEET, ACTUALLY."
00:35:28.001,00:35:29.419,MMM.
00:35:35.717,00:35:37.176,SHH.
00:35:43.349,00:35:46.144,HEY. THIS IS CINDY.
00:35:54.653,00:35:57.322,THIS IS A SPECTRUM ANALYZER.
00:35:57.322,00:36:00.325,I-I-IT MAKES GRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONS OF THE MUSIC.
00:36:00.325,00:36:03.078,WATCH.
00:36:03.078,00:36:06.123,GREG! HEY!
00:36:06.123,00:36:07.833,WHO'S THE GIRL?
00:36:07.833,00:36:09.960,ROSE MORGAN.
00:36:09.960,00:36:11.544,"HELLO, ROSE."
00:36:11.544,00:36:14.297,HENRY FINE. HE'S A PROFESSOR HERE IN ANTHROPOLOGY.
00:36:14.297,00:36:16.675,"AHH. HI, HENRY."
00:36:18.093,00:36:20.053,"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC, ISN'T IT?"
00:36:20.053,00:36:22.097,BEAUTIFUL.
00:36:24.975,00:36:27.644,"HI, MISS MORGAN."
00:36:27.644,00:36:29.646,YOU CAN DO BETTER!
00:36:29.646,00:36:31.189,SHH!
00:36:31.189,00:36:34.484,UHH!
00:36:37.612,00:36:38.989,HMM!
00:36:40.239,00:36:43.952,"OH, GOSH, I ENJOYED THAT."
00:36:43.952,00:36:45.286,WASN'T THAT TERRIFIC?
00:36:45.286,00:36:47.164,"OH, YEAH. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME."
00:36:47.164,00:36:48.581,"OH, MY PLEASURE."
00:36:48.581,00:36:51.668,"HEY, WHY DON'T YOU COME UP TO MY APARTMENT?"
00:36:51.668,00:36:55.213,I LIVE JUST ACROSS THE STREET.
00:36:55.213,00:36:57.549,"OH, I'D LOVE THAT."
00:36:57.549,00:36:59.551,"A COPY OF YOUR BOOK, I MEAN."
00:36:59.551,00:37:02.220,I DIDN'T MEAN TO IMPLY I WANT TO COME UP TO YOUR APARTMENT.
00:37:02.220,00:37:04.890,"BUT, BUT, ROSE, I'M INVITING YOU UP."
00:37:04.890,00:37:11.437,"OH, YEAH, WELL-- IF YOU LIKE THIS KIND OF MUSIC, I HAVE SOME WONDERFUL CDs, BUT THEY'RE, UH..."
00:37:11.437,00:37:15.025,"WELL, THEY'RE ALSO IN MY APARTMENT."
00:37:15.025,00:37:18.236,"GREG, LOOK, I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU."
00:37:18.236,00:37:22.032,"I, UH...I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE AT THIS."
00:37:22.032,00:37:25.410,"ROSE, I WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE."
00:37:25.410,00:37:29.414,IT IS?
00:37:29.414,00:37:32.709,I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SEX.
00:37:32.709,00:37:34.252,YOU'RE NOT?
00:37:34.252,00:37:36.796,"NO, AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU."
00:37:36.796,00:37:41.384,"NO, UH, IT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IN YOUR CLASS THE OTHER DAY."
00:37:41.384,00:37:46.264,IT DOES?
00:37:46.264,00:37:50.309,AND THE EMPHASIS ON SEX THAT KEEPS PEOPLE TODAY SEPARATE AND ALONE.
00:37:50.309,00:37:55.232,"A-A-AS YOU SAID YOURSELF, ROMANCE IS A MYTH; A MANIPULATION."
00:37:55.232,00:37:57.609,"OH, NO, WAIT."
00:37:55.232,00:37:59.318,I WAS REFERRING TO ACADEMIC OPINIONS THAT ARE PURELY SUBJECTIVE.
00:37:59.318,00:38:01.738,"BUT, ROSE, YOU WERE RIGHT."
00:37:59.318,00:38:05.366,I WASN'T NECESSARILY-- RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE BASED ON ROMANTIC LOVE ARE WORTHLESS.
00:38:05.366,00:38:07.786,THERE'S NO POINT TO THEM.
00:38:07.786,00:38:10.622,DID YOU STAY FOR MY WHOLE CLASS?
00:38:10.622,00:38:16.544,"NO, NO, I, UH-- WHILE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MUSIC THAT WE HEAR WHEN LOVERS KISS IN THE MOVIES."
00:38:16.544,00:38:25.262,"AND I AGREE, IT IS SO MANIPULATIVE BECAUSE IN REAL LIFE, WE DON'T HEAR MUSIC WHEN WE KISS, AND THE PERSON YOU'RE WITH ISN'T A MOVIE STAR."
00:38:25.262,00:38:28.681,"IT'S A MALICIOUS, UH, UH, A MALICIOUS-- FANTASY?"
00:38:28.681,00:38:30.809,FANTASY!
00:38:30.809,00:38:32.560,IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I SIT DOWN?
00:38:32.560,00:38:42.821,"THIS ADDICTION TO BEAUTY AND PERFECTION, UH, UH, THAT IS CREATED BY ADVERTISING, IT JUST FEEDS ON PEOPLE'S PATHETIC DESIRES."
00:38:42.821,00:38:46.783,PEOPLE--THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS ANYMORE.
00:38:46.783,00:38:50.369,"WELL, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN."
00:38:50.369,00:38:53.748,"UH, TV SHOWS TELL US WHAT A RELATIONSHIP IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE AND FEEL LIKE."
00:38:53.748,00:38:56.001,AND SEX-- YEAH?
00:38:56.001,00:38:59.545,I DON'T EVEN WANT TO TELL YOU HOW THAT'S RUINED MY LIFE.
00:38:59.545,00:39:03.883,WELL...I GO CRAZY.
00:39:03.883,00:39:07.512,"WHEN I WANT SOMEONE SEXUALLY, I GO OUT OF MY MIND."
00:39:43.882,00:39:54.851,"NOW, I DO BELIEVE TWO PEOPLE CAN COME TOGETHER, EVEN MARRY, FOR REASONS THAT ARE MORE, UH, CONCRETE, MORE MEANINGFUL THAN SEX."
00:39:54.851,00:40:01.983,"A LOVE THAT GROWS IN TIME OUT OF, UH, RESPECT, LOVE, TRUST, COMMON INTEREST."
00:40:01.983,00:40:04.944,YOU EVER NOTICE HOW MOST FRIENDSHIPS LAST LONGER THAN MOST MARRIAGES?
00:40:04.944,00:40:11.284,"WELL, THAT'S TRUE, BUT MAR-- IT'S VERY UNUSUAL THINKING IN THIS DAY AND AGE, BUT I THINK THE 12th CENTURY WAS ONTO SOMETHING."
00:40:11.284,00:40:14.079,WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE? TEA?
00:40:15.288,00:40:16.873,YOU GOT ANY SCOTCH?
00:40:20.543,00:40:23.046,"SO, ARE YOU BUSY DURING THE WEEK?"
00:40:23.046,00:40:30.011,"UM, WELL, I-- I WAS HOPING YOU COULD HELP ME WITH MY TEACHING."
00:40:30.011,00:40:33.681,"MAYBE YOU COULD SIT IN ON ONE OF MY CLASSES, TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK."
00:40:33.681,00:40:38.186,"FOR EXAMPLE, IF X SQUARED PLUS Y SQUARED EQUALS 16..."
00:40:59.249,00:41:03.169,"THE BODY LANGUAGE, IT'S VERY DETACHED, IT'S VERY ALIENATING."
00:41:03.169,00:41:05.088,"I MEAN, YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?"
00:41:05.088,00:41:11.219,"I--I--I JUST THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO RELATE MORE TO THE KIDS, UH, ENGAGE THEM."
00:41:11.219,00:41:15.848,"YOU'RE UP THERE WITH YOUR BACK TO THE ROOM, HAVING A GREAT TIME SOLVING YOUR OWN PROBLEMS."
00:41:15.848,00:41:19.352,IT'S LIKE YOU'RE HAVING A MATH PARTY AND YOU ONLY INVITED YOURSELF.
00:41:19.352,00:41:21.062,NO MATH PARTY.
00:41:21.062,00:41:25.733,"SO RELAX, LOOSEN UP, UH, HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT."
00:41:25.733,00:41:29.028,"RELAX, HAVE FUN."
00:41:29.028,00:41:32.198,PUT THE PEN DOWN.
00:41:32.198,00:41:34.159,I'M NOT GONNA TEST YOU ON THIS STUFF.
00:41:34.159,00:41:36.453,"COME ON, TEACH ME SOMETHING. ANYTHING."
00:41:36.453,00:41:38.871,OKAY. UM...
00:41:38.871,00:41:46.212,"IF, UM, A BALL IS THROWN INTO THE AIR AND ITS HEIGHT, H, EQUALS 100T..."
00:41:46.212,00:41:48.173,"GREGORY, YOU SEE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
00:41:48.173,00:41:50.091,T SQUARED. HMM?
00:41:50.091,00:41:51.384,TALK TO ME.
00:41:51.384,00:41:53.886,OKAY.
00:41:53.886,00:41:58.224,T IS TIME IN SECONDS. AT WHAT LIMIT IS THE SPEED APPROACHING WHEN T APPROACHES TWO SECONDS?
00:41:58.224,00:42:00.518,YOU LOST ME.
00:41:58.224,00:42:03.062,I'M ABSOLUTELY-- WHAT DOES ALL THAT MEAN?
00:42:03.062,00:42:06.316,"MAKE UP A STORY, JAZZ IT UP A LITTLE, MAYBE FIND SOME HUMOR IN IT."
00:42:06.316,00:42:08.360,HUMOR IN CALCULUS?
00:42:08.360,00:42:11.488,"HMM. WELL, TRY TELLING A STORY."
00:42:11.488,00:42:13.406,A STORY.
00:42:48.400,00:42:52.320,UMM...UH...
00:42:52.320,00:42:53.779,I'M SORRY.
00:42:53.779,00:42:58.159,"UH, TH-THAT'S ALL RIGHT."
00:42:58.159,00:42:59.369,DO WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?
00:42:59.369,00:43:02.121,"NO. ACTUALLY, I WANTED TO MAKE ONE."
00:43:02.121,00:43:03.622,IT'S ABOUT NEXT SEMESTER.
00:43:03.622,00:43:08.294,UH...UH...UH...
00:43:08.294,00:43:11.797,"UH, COULD YOU COME BACK TOMORROW AFTER CLASS?"
00:43:11.797,00:43:13.132,THANKS.
00:43:17.011,00:43:19.931,MY HEAD IS SWIMMING.
00:43:19.931,00:43:22.559,WHY DON'T YOU PUT YOUR HEAD BETWEEN YOUR LEGS?
00:43:22.559,00:43:24.394,THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
00:43:27.313,00:43:30.567,PRETTY GIRL.
00:43:30.567,00:43:34.487,HOW COULD YOU TELL UNDER ALL THAT MAKEUP?
00:43:34.487,00:43:37.990,WHAT'S THE POINT?
00:43:37.990,00:43:40.452,"NO, YOU'RE JUST TOO SMART FOR ALL THAT."
00:43:40.452,00:43:44.289,YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
00:43:44.289,00:43:46.916,I SOUND LIKE AN AIRLINE.
00:43:46.916,00:43:49.168,I'M SORRY.
00:43:49.168,00:43:52.964,"IT'S JUST THAT YOU DON'T NEED ANY OF THAT, ROSE."
00:43:55.383,00:43:57.510,THANKS.
00:43:57.510,00:44:00.679,HOW'S YOUR HEAD?
00:44:00.679,00:44:04.225,I THINK I'M ALL RIGHT.
00:44:04.225,00:44:07.479,"PIZZA, MAYBE?"
00:44:13.859,00:44:18.531,"OH, YOU COULD TAKE ME TO THAT GREAT DESSERT PLACE."
00:44:18.531,00:44:22.327,"MY MOTHER WOULD KILL ME, BUT I'D LOVE--WHAT IS THAT?"
00:44:22.327,00:44:24.287,"LOOK, LOOK. AHH!"
00:44:24.287,00:44:27.290,THIS IS THE ONE RIGHT HERE.
00:44:27.290,00:44:29.708,TREES. THEY'RE SO FASCINATING.
00:44:29.708,00:44:33.171,"THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TOUCH TO PROPAGATE, YOU KNOW."
00:44:33.171,00:44:35.756,"GREG, YOU WOULD FIND THAT FASCINATING."
00:44:35.756,00:44:38.134,HOW MANY DO I NEED?
00:44:38.134,00:44:39.844,"ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX."
00:44:39.844,00:44:42.096,"SIX? OH, YEAH, RIGHT."
00:44:45.766,00:44:48.978,SOMETIMES YOU DON'T SEE WHAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.
00:45:08.289,00:45:16.214,"FALLING IN LOVE IS A SOCIETAL, MAN-MADE CULTURAL CREATION AND EXPAND THAT TO INCLUDE A BIOLOGICAL PARTICIPATION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE INDIVIDUAL."
00:45:16.214,00:45:19.050,DO YOU SEE?
00:45:19.050,00:45:22.136,"OH, YOU'RE GONNA GET IT NOW, KID!"
00:45:22.136,00:45:24.763,OH! OH!
00:45:24.763,00:45:28.476,YOU'VE BEEN DATING THREE MONTHS AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN KISSED.
00:45:28.476,00:45:32.438,I CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE LOGISTICS OF THAT.
00:45:32.438,00:45:35.400,"WELL, WE NOD."
00:45:35.400,00:45:38.236,ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU HAVEN'T EVEN TOUCHED?
00:45:38.236,00:45:41.364,"WELL, I FELL DOWN ONCE, AND HE PICKED ME UP."
00:45:41.364,00:45:43.740,WE TALK A LOT.
00:45:43.740,00:45:45.784,ABOUT EVERYTHING.
00:45:45.784,00:45:49.497,"I DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT I SAY, WHAT I WEAR, WHAT I EAT."
00:45:49.497,00:45:55.336,IT'S SUCH A RELIEF EATING IN FRONT OF A MAN AND NOT WORRYING WHETHER HE'S GONNA GET FRIGHTENED OR NOT.
00:45:55.336,00:45:57.547,"HE'S REALLY FUN TO BE WITH, TOO."
00:45:57.547,00:46:01.426,MAYBE FUN IS TOO CHEERFUL A WORD. HE'S INTERESTING.
00:46:01.426,00:46:03.720,HOW MANY MEN CAN YOU SAY THAT ABOUT?
00:46:03.720,00:46:06.180,DO YOU THINK A TIE IS TOO PERSONAL A BIRTHDAY GIFT?
00:46:06.180,00:46:09.559,NOT UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNING TO USE IT ON SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN HIS NECK.
00:46:09.559,00:46:11.394,HEE-HEE!
00:46:11.394,00:46:13.812,DOES HE LOOK GOOD IN VESTS?
00:46:13.812,00:46:16.899,WHY DO YOU WANT HIM TO MEET YOUR MOTHER?
00:46:16.899,00:46:21.404,"I KEPT TELLING HIM WHAT A GREAT COOK I WAS. NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M OFFERING A BIRTHDAY DINNER."
00:46:21.404,00:46:26.325,"I'VE GOT TO FIND HIM SOMETHING NICE, 'CAUSE AFTER HE MEETS HER I'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN."
00:46:42.467,00:46:44.343,NO!
00:46:44.343,00:46:46.387,FRUIT!
00:46:46.387,00:46:49.515,"YES, FRUIT."
00:46:49.515,00:46:55.854,"OH, PLEASE. I SWEAR, IF HE WASN'T GORGEOUS, RICH, AND STRAIGHT, I WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN BOTHERED."
00:46:55.854,00:47:00.234,"NOTHING. I'M JUST SICK TO DEATH OF THE MAN I'M BOUND TO FOR ETERNITY, THAT'S ALL."
00:47:00.234,00:47:03.362,WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?
00:47:03.362,00:47:07.659,"BECAUSE NO MATTER WHERE I GO, NO MATTER WHAT I DO, THERE HE IS."
00:47:07.659,00:47:10.953,"IN THE KITCHEN, IN THE BATHROOM, ON THE PHONE, ON MY FINGER."
00:47:10.953,00:47:13.539,I WAS ASLEEP THE OTHER NIGHT AND I WAKE UP.
00:47:13.539,00:47:15.249,HE'S STARING AT ME.
00:47:15.249,00:47:17.460,YEAH.
00:47:17.460,00:47:21.172,"SWEET? I THINK IT'S KIND OF STRANGE. UH, HEY, WE'RE DONE. LET'S GO."
00:47:21.172,00:47:24.676,DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW WEIRD THAT MAKES ME FEEL?
00:47:24.676,00:47:29.888,"I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF MY LESBIAN ORGY DREAMS, AND HE'S STARING AT ME LIKE I'M SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE HIM."
00:47:29.888,00:47:31.683,I CAN'T EVEN FANTASIZE IN PRIVATE.
00:47:31.683,00:47:33.476,"HERE'S YOUR CHANGE, HON."
00:47:33.476,00:47:34.686,THANK YOU.
00:47:34.686,00:47:36.521,ONE SOUP.
00:47:36.521,00:47:40.065,SO...
00:47:40.065,00:47:42.527,MOM SAID YOU'VE BEEN SEEING SOMEBODY PRETTY STEADY.
00:47:42.527,00:47:44.403,SHE DID? HMM.
00:47:44.403,00:47:45.697,MMM...
00:47:45.697,00:47:47.323,"OH, SHOOT."
00:47:47.323,00:47:49.492,WHAT?
00:47:49.492,00:47:51.410,"OH, HI, ALEX."
00:47:51.410,00:47:52.953,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
00:47:52.953,00:47:56.248,"WELL, I, UH, I THOUGHT I'D MEET YOU FOR COFFEE."
00:47:56.248,00:47:58.626,IS THAT A TERRIBLE THING TO DO?
00:47:58.626,00:48:01.796,MMM. EXCUSE ME.
00:48:01.796,00:48:05.466,I'M GOING TO THE LADIES' ROOM...ALONE.
00:48:07.635,00:48:09.178,HMM.
00:48:09.178,00:48:12.431,WOW. CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS WEATHER?
00:48:12.431,00:48:14.851,"IT'S ALMOST APRIL, AND IT'S STILL COLD."
00:48:17.186,00:48:18.813,"I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU ALONE, ACTUALLY."
00:48:18.813,00:48:21.566,CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
00:48:21.566,00:48:24.819,"IT'S GONNA SOUND STRANGE, BUT, UM..."
00:48:24.819,00:48:28.364,IS CLAIRE HAPPY?
00:48:28.364,00:48:30.658,"I MEAN, DO YOU THINK SHE'S HAPPY?"
00:48:31.992,00:48:37.540,"UM, YES, I-I THINK SHE IS. WHY?"
00:48:37.540,00:48:40.668,I'M BEING SILLY.
00:48:40.668,00:48:47.508,"WAKE UP EVERY MORNING TELLING ME HOW ECSTATIC SHE IS, I...I WORRY."
00:48:47.508,00:48:50.428,HMM.
00:48:50.428,00:48:54.973,"DID YOU EVER THINK THAT WHEN YOU AND I FIRST MET, I'D END UP MARRYING YOUR SISTER?"
00:48:54.973,00:48:57.934,AND I HAVE YOU TO THANK FOR IT.
00:48:57.934,00:49:01.188,YOU MADE THIS POSSIBLE.
00:49:01.188,00:49:05.359,"KNOWING YOU HAS CHANGED MY LIFE, ROSE."
00:49:05.359,00:49:07.528,DON'T DO-- DON'T DO THAT.
00:49:07.528,00:49:10.489,WHAT? WHAT AM I DOING?
00:49:12.617,00:49:14.993,"YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW, DO YOU?"
00:49:19.791,00:49:21.709,"OH, ROSE."
00:49:21.709,00:49:24.253,"JUST TELL CLAIRE THAT I HAD TO RUN, OKAY?"
00:49:24.253,00:49:26.338,"ROSE, ROSE, I'M SORRY."
00:49:31.218,00:49:36.599,"WOW, I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS OVER HIM."
00:49:36.599,00:49:39.602,I MUST SOUND SO PATHETIC.
00:49:39.602,00:49:41.646,"NO, NO. NOT AT ALL."
00:49:41.646,00:49:46.275,"HE ASKED IF CLAIRE WAS HAPPY, AND I LIED."
00:49:46.275,00:49:48.152,ISN'T THAT AWFUL?
00:49:48.152,00:49:50.362,NOTHING CRIMINAL.
00:49:51.739,00:49:54.325,THANK YOU FOR SEEING ME ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
00:49:54.325,00:49:57.286,YOU SOUNDED SO UPSET OVER THE PHONE. ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER NOW?
00:49:57.286,00:49:59.996,"YEAH. YEAH, A LITTLE."
00:49:59.996,00:50:02.249,"YOU KNOW, ROSE, IT TAKES TIME."
00:50:02.249,00:50:04.460,"YEAH, I KNOW."
00:50:04.460,00:50:08.297,"GREG, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I..."
00:50:08.297,00:50:11.258,I REALLY VALUE OUR FRIENDSHIP.
00:50:11.258,00:50:13.385,IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.
00:50:13.385,00:50:20.726,"I FEEL THE SAME WAY, WHICH IS WHY TONIGHT-- TONIGHT!"
00:50:20.726,00:50:22.728,"I'LL SEE YOU AT 8:00, OKAY?"
00:50:22.728,00:50:25.648,"UH, SHALL I BRING ANYTHING?"
00:50:25.648,00:50:27.399,"UH, YEAH."
00:50:27.399,00:50:32.028,A WOODEN STAKE AND A CRUCIFIX.
00:50:34.490,00:50:37.075,ROSE LOVES TO FOLD NAPKINS.
00:50:37.075,00:50:39.203,ONE OF HER IDIOSYNCRASIES.
00:50:39.203,00:50:40.496,OH.
00:50:40.496,00:50:42.498,YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
00:50:42.498,00:50:47.712,I CAME HOME LATE FROM WORK AND JUST THREW THIS ON.
00:50:52.048,00:50:53.258,OH.
00:50:53.258,00:50:55.469,I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
00:50:55.469,00:50:58.723,"MY GOD, ROSE, IT'S ART."
00:50:58.723,00:51:00.432,"OH, NO, IT'S NOT ART."
00:51:00.432,00:51:04.603,"NO, NO, AN ARTIST ISN'T JUST SOMEBODY WHO PAINTS OR SCULPTS."
00:51:04.603,00:51:10.150,"IT'S SOMEBODY WHO SETS THE TABLE A CERTAIN WAY, PREPARES THE MEAL OR TEACHES A CERTAIN WAY."
00:51:10.150,00:51:12.403,YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
00:51:12.403,00:51:14.030,MMM.
00:51:14.030,00:51:17.491,"WHY DIDN'T YOU USE THE LIMOGES, DEAR?"
00:51:17.491,00:51:20.285,MAY I SERVE YOU?
00:51:21.704,00:51:24.289,ROSE!
00:51:24.289,00:51:27.919,"WE GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE, AND ROSE AND I DON'T EAT VERY MUCH."
00:51:27.919,00:51:30.462,REALLY?
00:51:30.462,00:51:34.008,OH. WHENEVER I'VE BEEN WITH ROSE I'VE NOTICED SHE'S HAD A VERY HEALTHY APPETITE.
00:51:34.008,00:51:36.218,TO SAY THE LEAST.
00:51:36.218,00:51:40.264,I CAN'T STAND WOMEN WHO EAT TWO BITES AND SAY THEY'RE FULL.
00:51:40.264,00:51:42.850,OH. UM...
00:51:42.850,00:51:46.102,"ROSE, DO YOU REALLY NEED EXTRA SALT, DEAR?"
00:51:46.102,00:51:49.314,YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WATER A WOMAN RETAINS WITH TOO MUCH SALT.
00:51:50.315,00:51:52.234,CAN I HAVE SOME?
00:51:52.234,00:51:54.820,"I'D LOVE POTATOES, TOO."
00:51:54.820,00:51:57.573,I'VE NEVER SEEN A TEACHER TEACH WITH SUCH PASSION.
00:51:57.573,00:51:59.951,HAVE YOU EVER SAT IN ON ONE OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S CLASSES?
00:51:59.951,00:52:01.619,MY MOTHER SIT IN ON ONE OF MY CLASSES?
00:52:01.619,00:52:04.663,ROSE!
00:52:04.663,00:52:07.249,"OH, THAT'S-- TH-THAT'S THE BEST PART."
00:52:07.249,00:52:09.835,MMM.
00:52:10.669,00:52:12.713,MMM! MMM.
00:52:12.713,00:52:16.050,ROSE TELLS ME YOU'VE NEVER BEEN MARRIED.
00:52:16.050,00:52:20.304,"MOM! PL-- YEAH, TH-TH-THAT'S ALL RIGHT, ROSE."
00:52:20.304,00:52:22.681,"THAT'S CORRECT, UH, MRS. MORGAN."
00:52:22.681,00:52:28.813,"I-I HAVEN'T, UH-- I GUESS IT'S THE OLD SAYING THAT, UH, I JUST HAVEN'T FOUND THE RIGHT GIRL."
00:52:28.813,00:52:34.110,"I HAVE HAD SEVERAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVEN'T WORKED OUT, BUT THAT'S ALL GONNA CHANGE."
00:52:34.110,00:52:36.070,"OH, REALLY? WHY?"
00:52:36.070,00:52:42.994,"WELL, AS I, UH, AS I'VE TOLD ROSE, I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT LOVE..."
00:52:42.994,00:52:45.454,"AND, UH, SEX."
00:52:45.454,00:52:46.998,DOES ANYBODY WANT COFFEE?
00:52:46.998,00:52:48.415,"OH, I-I'D LOVE SOME."
00:52:48.415,00:52:49.583,WHAT THEORY?
00:52:49.583,00:52:52.128,"UH, SEX."
00:52:52.128,00:52:55.131,REGULAR.
00:52:55.131,00:52:58.009,UHH-- I COULD MAKE CAPPUCCINOS.
00:52:58.009,00:53:01.303,CAPPUCCINOS. WOULD YOU LIKE CAPPUCCINOS?
00:53:01.303,00:53:04.056,"GREG, WHY DON'T YOU COME TO THE KITCHEN AND HELP ME."
00:53:04.056,00:53:05.850,"ROSE, GO PUT THE COFFEE ON."
00:53:05.850,00:53:08.811,"MOTHER, I MADE DINNER."
00:53:08.811,00:53:12.857,I RAISED TWO DAUGHTERS; I BURIED A HUSBAND; I'VE MADE MY COFFEE.
00:53:21.657,00:53:24.618,"WELL, ALONE AT LAST."
00:53:26.286,00:53:28.080,I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.
00:53:28.080,00:53:30.206,AND I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU.
00:53:30.206,00:53:32.918,OH?
00:53:32.918,00:53:36.380,YOU'VE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF MY DAUGHTER THESE LAST FEW MONTHS.
00:53:36.380,00:53:39.633,"I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING, BUT..."
00:53:39.633,00:53:42.678,I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS ARE.
00:53:44.555,00:53:46.390,MY INTENTIONS?
00:53:47.265,00:53:49.768,HMM. WELL...

00:53:57.568,00:53:59.028,"NO, NO, ON THE CONTRARY."
00:53:59.028,00:54:00.946,BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO ALL THAT TROUBLE.
00:54:00.946,00:54:02.948,OF COURSE I HAD TO.
00:54:02.948,00:54:07.203,"IT WAS YOUR BIRTHDAY, AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE FRIENDS FOR BUT TO..."

00:54:18.172,00:54:22.258,YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS.
00:54:23.510,00:54:25.221,MMM.
00:54:25.221,00:54:29.892,"THEY ONCE WERE DICE, BUT NOW THEY ARE CUFF LINKS WITH..."
00:54:29.892,00:54:33.187,PRIME NUMBERS!
00:54:33.187,00:54:35.814,THEY ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:54:55.000,00:54:58.712,"I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING, AND I CAN ONLY SAY THIS ONCE."
00:54:58.712,00:55:00.131,WHAT?
00:55:00.131,00:55:02.549,"UH, S-S-SIT DOWN."
00:55:03.801,00:55:15.896,"I-I THINK WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON, AND-- ALTHOUGH I'M AWARE CERTAIN VARIABLES ARE AND FOREVER WILL BE UNKNOWN, AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST COMPLEX EQUATIONS WHERE YOU HAVE TWO COMPLETELY-- GREG, TALK TO ME."
00:55:17.106,00:55:19.691,"I'M NOT SAYING THIS RIGHT, AM I? UM..."
00:55:19.691,00:55:21.026,WHAT?
00:55:22.444,00:55:29.451,"WELL, THIS, THIS FEELING YOU HAVE FOR ALEX-- I-I-IT WON'T BE THE SAME WITH ME."
00:55:29.451,00:55:37.042,"YOU WON'T HAVE THAT CONSTANT ACHE IN THE PIT OF YOUR STOMACH, BECAUSE, WELL, WE'RE NOT IN LOVE."
00:55:37.042,00:55:40.045,MMM.
00:55:37.042,00:55:42.047,I-I THINK WE DO SHARE A GENUINE AFFECTION FOR EACH OTHER.
00:55:42.047,00:55:46.593,W-WE SHARE A PASSION FOR KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN A PHYSICAL PASSION.
00:55:46.593,00:55:58.522,"ALTHOUGH IF, UM, SEX IS, UH, SOMETHING THAT INTERESTS YOU, UH, I'M SURE I COULD PROVIDE THAT ON OCCASION, UH, GIVEN ENOUGH WARNING."
00:55:58.522,00:56:01.192,UH-- WH-WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
00:56:01.192,00:56:04.945,"WE WERE BOTH IN LOVE, WE WERE BOTH MISERABLE AND WE'RE BOTH ALONE."
00:56:04.945,00:56:08.032,"WHICH IS A WASTE, REALLY, BECAUSE AS PEOPLE, WE'RE QUITE VALUABLE."
00:56:08.032,00:56:09.574,YEAH?
00:56:09.574,00:56:10.826,ROSE.
00:56:10.826,00:56:13.495,WHEN I LOOK AT YOU...
00:56:13.495,00:56:16.874,I-I SEE A--A WOMAN UNLIKE ANY I'VE EVER KNOWN BEFORE.
00:56:16.874,00:56:21.920,"YOUR MIND, YOUR HUMOR, YOUR PASSION FOR IDEAS."
00:56:21.920,00:56:23.714,I-I'M VERY FOND OF YOU.
00:56:23.714,00:56:32.973,"I-I-I FEEL, IN A STRANGE WAY-- WHEN I'M WITH YOU, I FEEL AS IF I'M-- WELL, AS IF I'M HOME."
00:56:34.933,00:56:36.894,"SO, I-I THINK WE SHOULD GET MARRIED."
00:56:36.894,00:56:41.899,HUH?
00:56:41.899,00:56:44.360,WHY ARE MY REASONS ANY MORE INSANE THAN THOSE?
00:56:46.945,00:56:49.405,"ARE YOU IN SHOCK, OR JUST APPALLED?"
00:56:50.699,00:56:52.701,BLINK IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.
00:56:54.203,00:56:57.706,WH-WHAT?
00:56:57.706,00:57:00.084,I JUST--I-I'M SORRY.
00:56:57.706,00:57:02.586,"WHAT CAME-- THIS SOUNDS SILLY, BUT..."
00:57:02.586,00:57:04.380,I WAS JUST THINKING...
00:57:05.797,00:57:09.051,H-HOW COULD I MARRY SOMEONE...
00:57:09.051,00:57:11.136,THAT I'VE NEVER EVEN...
00:57:14.348,00:57:15.682,YOU KNOW.
00:57:17.642,00:57:18.977,OH.
00:57:27.403,00:57:28.820,KISSED.
00:57:30.572,00:57:34.492,"YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU ANSWER, UH, THERE IS ONE OTHER THING I HAVE TO TELL YOU."
00:57:34.492,00:57:38.080,"I PROMISED YOUR SISTER I WOULDN'T, BUT I CAN'T ENTER INTO THIS WITHOUT YOU KNOWING."
00:57:38.080,00:57:41.208,"YOU LOVE CLAIRE, TOO?"
00:57:41.208,00:57:44.253,YOU'VE JUST SLEPT WITH HER.
00:57:44.253,00:57:46.964,YOU WANNA SLEEP WITH HER.
00:57:46.964,00:57:49.049,OHH!
00:57:49.049,00:57:53.178,"YOU SEE, I WROTE THIS AD-- AN-AN AD?"
00:57:53.178,00:57:55.013,I THINK THAT'S KINDA GREAT.
00:57:55.013,00:57:56.807,"OH, YOU DO?"
00:57:56.807,00:57:59.435,"OH, WHAT A RELIEF. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE UPSET."
00:57:59.435,00:58:01.019,WHY? YOU PICKED ME.
00:58:01.019,00:58:04.148,"WELL, ACTUALLY, I FOUND YOU THROUGH THIS AD."
00:58:04.148,00:58:08.026,IT WAS THIS CHARMING WOMAN ON TV.
00:58:08.026,00:58:10.279,"UH, FELICIA, I BELIEVE HER NAME WAS."
00:58:10.279,00:58:13.157,I THINK SHE WAS ALSO AN EDUCATOR OF SORTS.
00:58:19.537,00:58:20.914,HMM.
00:58:22.499,00:58:24.335,"WELL, WELL, WELL."
00:58:25.669,00:58:27.004,AHHH!
00:58:32.509,00:58:35.179,GREGORY JUST PROPOSED TO ME.
00:58:36.638,00:58:38.807,DO YOU NEED A VALIUM?
00:58:38.807,00:58:44.855,"I KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH RESPECT FOR MY OPINION, BUT, UH, I DON'T TRUST HIM."
00:58:44.855,00:58:47.983,"I MEAN, WHERE'S THE ATTRACTION?"
00:58:47.983,00:58:50.319,"YOU MEAN, WHY IS HE ATTRACTED TO ME?"
00:58:50.319,00:58:52.863,"HE'S NOT, MOTHER."
00:58:52.863,00:58:55.824,HE DOESN'T WANT SEX.
00:58:55.824,00:58:57.034,COMPANIONS?
00:58:58.576,00:59:01.205,WHAT SANE PERSON WOULD AGREE TO THAT KIND OF MARRIAGE?
00:59:01.205,00:59:03.707,I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUS.
00:59:03.707,00:59:05.917,"WHAT'S NATURAL, CLAIRE AND ALEX?"
00:59:05.917,00:59:09.754,"HE WANTS ME. MAYBE NOT THE SAME WAY YOU AND CLAIRE WERE WANTED, BUT WANTED."
00:59:09.754,00:59:12.757,"SURE, HE WANTS YOU-- TO COOK AND CLEAN FOR HIM."
00:59:12.757,00:59:15.052,THEN IT WON'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN LIVING HERE.
00:59:15.052,00:59:18.180,I HAPPEN TO KNOW HE FOUND YOU THROUGH AN AD.
00:59:18.180,00:59:21.141,"I ALREADY KNOW, MOM."
00:59:24.102,00:59:28.148,"I KNOW THIS ISN'T YOUR AVERAGE PROPOSAL, BUT..."
00:59:28.148,00:59:32.361,"LET'S FACE IT. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT STANDING IN LINE FOR ME."
00:59:32.361,00:59:35.989,"BESIDES, WE-- WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON."
00:59:35.989,00:59:39.993,THEN SAY YES.
00:59:39.993,00:59:44.915,"IF YOU THINK GETTING MARRIED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS IS NORMAL, THEN GO AHEAD."
00:59:47.042,00:59:48.960,WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
00:59:50.254,00:59:52.630,WHY DO YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO...
00:59:52.630,00:59:54.758,PATHETIC?
00:59:54.758,00:59:58.887,"YOU HAD A LIFE, A HUSBAND WHO ADORED YOU."
00:59:58.887,01:00:03.183,WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME TO HAVE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF THAT?
01:00:04.560,01:00:06.437,"I'M GETTING OLDER, TOO, MOM."
01:00:06.437,01:00:09.523,WHY CAN'T YOU BE HAPPY FOR ME?
01:00:09.523,01:00:11.816,"BUT YOU CAN'T, CAN YOU?"
01:00:11.816,01:00:13.860,MM-MMM.
01:00:13.860,01:00:17.114,BECAUSE YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF BEING ALONE...
01:00:17.114,01:00:18.365,AND YOU'RE JEALOUS.
01:00:18.365,01:00:19.783,JEALOUS?
01:00:19.783,01:00:22.494,JEALOUS BECAUSE A MAN WANTS ME.
01:00:22.494,01:00:24.746,A GOOD-LOOKING MAN WANTS ME.
01:00:24.746,01:00:27.458,HOW RIDICULOUS.
01:00:27.458,01:00:30.377,"WELL, YOU KNOW SOMETHING, MOM?"
01:00:30.377,01:00:32.129,A MAN DOES.
01:00:50.021,01:00:59.573,TODAY GREGORY THOMAS LARKIN AND ROSE RACHEL MORGAN HAVE PLACED RINGS ON EACH OTHER'S FINGERS AND HAVE AGREED TO SHARE THEIR LIVES AND HOPES AND RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER AS EQUALS.
01:00:59.573,01:01:04.328,THEY SHALL SEEK THROUGH KINDNESS AND UNDERSTANDING TO ACHIEVE A LIFE TOGETHER AS THEY HAVE ENVISIONED.
01:01:04.328,01:01:10.708,"WE ARE GATHERED HERE TO PARTICIPATE AND WITNESS THIS SPECIAL CEREMONY OF MARRIAGE, WHICH IS A MEANS OF ESTABLISHING AND CONTINUING A HOME."
01:01:10.708,01:01:21.428,"IN AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE CONSENTED TOGETHER TO LIVE IN WEDLOCK AND HAVE EXCHANGED VOWS BEFORE WITNESSES, BY THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU HUSBAND AND WIFE."
01:01:21.428,01:01:23.305,"HERE'S YOUR CERTIFICATE, AND GOOD LUCK."
01:01:23.305,01:01:25.265,"THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR."

01:01:25.265,01:01:29.853,"SHE'S A GREAT-- YES, SHE IS."

01:01:29.853,01:01:34.774,YOU'RE PRETTY-- WE ALL OUGHT TO-- ABSOLUTELY.
01:01:34.774,01:01:37.528,EXCUSE ME.
01:01:37.528,01:01:41.615,"IF I'D KNOWN YOU WERE THIS GOOD-LOOKING, I'D HAVE ANSWERED THE AD FOR MYSELF."
01:01:41.615,01:01:46.161,SHE'S THE BEST PERSON I KNOW.
01:01:46.161,01:01:49.122,"IF I WERE A MAN, I'D BE ALL OVER HER."
01:01:49.122,01:01:50.832,"OH, GOOD LUCK..."
01:01:50.832,01:01:53.001,"AND, UH, CONGRATULATIONS."
01:01:53.001,01:01:56.046,"I'M SURE YOU'LL BOTH BE VERY, UH, FASCINATING TO WATCH."
01:01:56.046,01:02:06.473,MARRIAGE IS A SUPREME SHARING OF EXPERIENCE-- YEAH?
01:02:06.473,01:02:10.101,ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW MANY BOOKS YOU ACCUMULATE OVER THE YEARS?
01:02:10.101,01:02:12.062,"YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN."
01:02:12.062,01:02:13.813,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
01:02:13.813,01:02:15.732,AND THE DUST!
01:02:15.732,01:02:17.859,"GOD, THIS PLACE NEEDS A GOOD CLEANING."

01:02:36.961,01:02:39.423,"SO, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?"
01:02:40.882,01:02:43.260,GO TO BED.
01:02:43.260,01:02:46.638,"TO SLEEP, I MEAN."
01:02:46.638,01:02:51.393,YOU GO THE BED FOR SLEEPING.
01:02:52.769,01:02:54.812,UNLESS YOU'D RATHER DO SOMETHING ELSE.
01:02:54.812,01:02:56.648,"I'M SORRY, WHAT?"
01:02:56.648,01:02:58.816,I WASN'T GOING TO SAY ANYTHING.
01:02:58.816,01:03:00.777,ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

01:05:57.913,01:06:01.625,"HAVE YOU TWO, UH-- NO, AND IT HASN'T MADE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE."
01:06:01.625,01:06:05.545,"I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT, BUT IF IT WORKS, I GIVE YOU BOTH A LOT OF CREDIT."
01:06:05.545,01:06:07.672,CREDIT? CREDIT FOR WHAT?
01:06:07.672,01:06:11.217,I WAS JUST TELLING HENRY HOW SEX ISN'T AN ISSUE FOR US.
01:06:11.217,01:06:12.761,MMM. THAT'S TRUE.
01:06:12.761,01:06:15.680,"I MEAN, IT'S MUCH LESS COMPLICATED THIS WAY."

01:07:07.273,01:07:10.944,I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW EASILY IT'S COMING. I HAVE OUTLINES FOR 3 CHAPTERS ALREADY.
01:07:10.944,01:07:12.153,THAT'S GREAT.
01:07:12.153,01:07:15.615,"WHAT A TERRIFIC IDEA THIS WAS OF YOURS, ROSE, TO COME HERE TO THE PARK."
01:07:15.615,01:07:18.618,I-I'VE NEVER WRITTEN IN THE PARK.
01:07:18.618,01:07:22.288,I'M GLAD.

01:07:51.860,01:07:54.738,ENGAGED? OH!
01:07:54.738,01:07:57.448,I FINALLY FOUND SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T CANCEL ON ME.
01:07:57.448,01:07:59.283,"WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE?"
01:07:59.283,01:08:00.744,"NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO."

01:09:10.563,01:09:12.983,"OH, I DIDN'T TELL YOU."
01:09:12.983,01:09:18.029,I RECEIVED A FEW INVITATIONS FROM SOME EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES TO LECTURE ON MY BOOK.
01:09:18.029,01:09:19.238,"OH, THAT'S NICE."
01:09:19.238,01:09:23.910,"I TOLD THEM, OF COURSE, THAT, UH, I WANTED TO CHECK WITH YOU FIRST."

01:09:38.091,01:09:40.969,I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND PEOPLE'S FASCINATION WITH BASEBALL.
01:09:40.969,01:09:44.681,I DON'T SEE THE POINT OF PLAYING A GAME WHERE YOU WIND UP AT THE SAME PLACE YOU STARTED.
01:09:44.681,01:09:51.521,"WELL, ACTUALLY, THIS SHOULD INTEREST YOU BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT STATS AND AVERAGES."
01:09:51.521,01:09:53.815,STATS AND AVERAGES.
01:09:53.815,01:09:58.235,"SEE THAT? EVERY TIME A PLAYER COMES UP, THEY FLASH THAT 3-DIGIT NUMBER."
01:09:58.235,01:10:04.868,THAT IS THE PLAYER'S AVERAGE: HOW MANY TIMES HE HITS THE BALL IN RATIO TO HOW MANY TIMES HE COMES UP TO BAT.
01:10:04.868,01:10:06.661,"NOW, WHICH NUMBER IS IT?"
01:10:06.661,01:10:14.127,AN EQUATION SUCH AS THE SECOND DERIVATIVE OF THE FUNCTION F WITH RESPECT TO THE VARIABLE X EQUALS A CONSTANT.
01:10:21.676,01:10:24.554,"UH, ANYBODY SEE THE GAME YESTERDAY?"
01:10:24.554,01:10:26.848,"THAT MARRAKESH-- WHAT A BUM, HUH?"

01:10:33.229,01:10:39.777,"UM, WHEN MEASURING TRAJECTORIES, UH, IF A BATTER HITS A BALL, HOW CAN WE DETERMINE HOW FAR THAT BALL WILL GO?"
01:10:39.777,01:10:42.572,WHAT ARE THE VARIABLES NEEDED TO HIT A HOME RUN?
01:10:42.572,01:10:44.991,PRETENDING FOR A MOMENT THAT THE BUM COULD HIT A HOME RUN.
01:10:46.492,01:10:49.704,THE...VELOCITY WITH WHICH THE BALL LEAVES THE BAT?

01:10:53.791,01:10:56.669,DOES A RISING FASTBALL REALLY RISE?

01:11:35.458,01:11:40.213,"NO, SHE DOESN'T CARE FOR PEPPER, BUT I'LL HAVE SOME."
01:11:40.213,01:11:44.383,"OH, AND COULD YOU BRING HER A LITTLE SIDE DISH OF EXTRA DRESSING?"
01:11:44.383,01:11:46.761,SHE LIKES A LITTLE EXTRA.

01:12:37.770,01:12:41.149,"AND, UH, AND NOW, I BELIEVE, COMES MY FAVORITE PART."

01:23:37.012,01:23:39.389,EVERYTHING WAS GOING SO WELL.
01:23:40.683,01:23:43.686,AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO.
01:23:43.686,01:23:48.064,"WELL, IS THAT THE TRUTH, OR IS THAT SOME KIND OF FEMALE MANIPULATION?"
01:23:48.064,01:23:50.985,I WISH YOU WOULD JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

01:24:00.452,01:24:07.292,"I-I HAD HOPED THAT, EVEN THOUGH I INITIALLY MADE THE OFFER, BY NOW YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR IT."
01:24:07.292,01:24:10.754,I'D HOPED WE HAD GOTTEN BEYOND IT.
01:24:10.754,01:24:13.382,DID YOU HONESTLY THINK THIS WAS THE NEXT STEP?
01:24:15.384,01:24:18.178,"Y-YOU-- ROSE, YOU HAVE IT ALL BACKWARDS."
01:24:18.178,01:24:21.640,WHAT WE HAVE USUALLY COMES AFTER ALL THIS NONSENSE IS OVER.
01:24:21.640,01:24:25.268,MOST PEOPLE NEVER GET TO WHERE WE ARE IN REGARDS TO SHARING AND RESPECT.
01:24:25.268,01:24:30.315,"INSTEAD THEY TRY TO KEEP THE SEX GOING, AND WHEN THAT FADES, THEN THEY'RE ON TO SOMEONE NEW."
01:24:30.315,01:24:34.444,"THAT'S WHY OUR RELATIONSHIP WORKS, BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER PHYSICAL."
01:24:34.444,01:24:38.365,I TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NO PHYSICAL ATTRACTION.
01:24:41.911,01:24:46.206,"ROSE, I-- ROSE, I'M SORRY."
01:24:46.206,01:24:48.250,ROSE?
01:24:48.250,01:24:57.342,"IT-- IT'S JUST THAT I-- I'VE NEVER HAD THIS WITH A WOMAN BEFORE, THE WAY I CAN TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING AND SHARE EVERYTHING WITH YOU."
01:25:00.262,01:25:04.224,"UH, ARE--ARE YOU-- A-ARE YOU NOT SATISFIED WITH ME?"
01:25:05.475,01:25:06.810,ROSE?
01:25:08.144,01:25:14.359,"MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAD TO COME UP, SOMETHING THAT WE HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH TOGETHER."
01:25:14.359,01:25:17.404,MAYBE-- MAYBE THIS LECTURE TOUR IS COMING AT A GOOD TIME.
01:25:17.404,01:25:22.117,MAYBE WE COULD USE SOME DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE.
01:25:22.117,01:25:25.704,DON'T YOU THINK?
01:25:25.704,01:25:28.040,I THOUGHT WE WERE GOOD FRIENDS.
01:25:28.040,01:25:31.501,"TALK TO ME, ROSE."
01:25:31.501,01:25:34.755,"ROSE, COME ON, LET ME IN."
01:25:34.755,01:25:38.842,"I-I-I'M SORRY, R-- ROSE."
01:25:41.053,01:25:43.764,"COME ON, OPEN THE DOOR."
01:25:49.478,01:25:53.857,"WILL YOU OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE?"
01:25:53.857,01:25:55.484,"COME ON, ROSE."
01:27:10.809,01:27:12.978,WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
01:27:16.815,01:27:21.319,JUST...CAME TO SLEEP IN MY OWN BED.
01:27:22.404,01:27:25.657,WHAT HAPPENED?
01:27:25.657,01:27:30.079,"I DON'T WANT TO SAY I TOLD YOU SO, BUT..."
01:27:30.079,01:27:31.329,MOM?
01:27:31.329,01:27:33.916,WHAT?
01:27:33.916,01:27:36.085,WHEN I WAS A BABY...
01:27:37.920,01:27:39.755,DID YOU THINK I WAS PRETTY?
01:27:41.548,01:27:45.802,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, BUT ALL BABIES ARE PRETTY."
01:27:45.802,01:27:47.596,NO.
01:27:47.596,01:27:49.598,"NO, I MEAN ME."
01:27:51.516,01:27:54.019,ME.
01:27:54.019,01:27:57.231,YOU MUST'VE THOUGHT SOMETHING ABOUT HOW I LOOKED.
01:27:59.649,01:28:02.569,"WELL, WHAT'S PRETTY ANYWAY?"
01:28:02.569,01:28:05.155,WHAT GOOD DID IT DO YOUR SISTER?
01:28:10.160,01:28:11.453,MMM.
01:28:13.371,01:28:16.458,DO YOU REMEMBER...
01:28:16.458,01:28:18.501,WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL...
01:28:20.129,01:28:27.594,"YOU USED TO TELL ME TO, UM, PUSH MY NOSE UP WITH MY INDEX FINGER..."
01:28:27.594,01:28:29.096,SO IT WOULDN'T DROOP.
01:28:29.096,01:28:31.681,I DID NOT.
01:28:31.681,01:28:35.060,NO. THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
01:28:35.060,01:28:37.562,"IT'S FUNNY, TOO, BECAUSE..."
01:28:37.562,01:28:43.026,I NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT I--I WASN'T PRETTY...
01:28:43.026,01:28:46.780,IF IT WEREN'T FOR THOSE THINGS YOU SAID.
01:28:46.780,01:28:51.994,"IF YOU'VE COME HOME TO SAY MORE CRUEL THINGS TO ME, I'M GOING TO BED."
01:28:51.994,01:28:53.245,MOM?
01:28:53.245,01:28:57.040,WHAT?
01:28:57.040,01:28:58.875,HOW DID IT FEEL?
01:28:58.875,01:29:00.836,HOW DID WHAT FEEL?
01:29:00.836,01:29:03.005,BEING BEAUTIFUL.
01:29:03.005,01:29:04.422,"OH, STOP IT."
01:29:04.422,01:29:06.508,"NO, I MEAN IT."
01:29:06.508,01:29:08.426,HOW DID IT FEEL...
01:29:08.426,01:29:12.014,HAVING PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU WITH...
01:29:12.014,01:29:15.058,SUCH ADMIRATION...
01:29:15.058,01:29:18.187,LOOKING AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR...
01:29:19.354,01:29:21.315,WITH...
01:29:21.315,01:29:23.233,SUCH APPRECIATION?
01:29:26.111,01:29:27.737,HOW DID THAT FEEL?
01:29:38.123,01:29:40.334,IT WAS WONDERFUL.
01:29:49.176,01:29:50.510,YEAH.
01:29:51.678,01:29:54.097,I'LL BET.
01:30:03.106,01:30:05.984,"HI, HANNAH."
01:30:05.984,01:30:08.820,NO. SHE'S GONE OUT.
01:30:08.820,01:30:13.075,"NO, HANNAH, THE POINT IS, I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU MESSAGES, AND SHE HASN'T CALLED BACK."
01:30:13.075,01:30:15.702,I-I-I WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY WIFE.
01:30:15.702,01:30:17.829,I'LL TELL HER.
01:30:17.829,01:30:23.752,FLIGHT 622 FOR PARIS NOW BOARDING AT GATE 24.
01:30:30.550,01:30:33.511,"ROSE, I HATED THE WAY WE--WE LEFT EACH OTHER."
01:30:33.511,01:30:36.890,"I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU PERSONALLY, NOT THROUGH YOUR MOTHER."
01:30:36.890,01:30:41.144,"I-I-I DON'T LIKE LEAVING THIS WAY, BUT MY-MY-MY PLANE IS-IS HERE."
01:30:41.144,01:30:45.607,"UM, I-I HOPE YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T ERASE THIS MESSAGE."
01:30:49.111,01:30:52.614,I-I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
01:30:54.490,01:30:57.286,"ROSE, I HATED THE WAY WE--WE LEFT EACH OTHER."
01:30:57.286,01:31:00.289,"I WANTED TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOU PERSONALLY, NOT THROUGH YOUR MOTHER."
01:31:14.386,01:31:18.098,YOU'RE UP EARLY.
01:31:18.098,01:31:21.810,I HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED.
01:31:21.810,01:31:23.353,YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO BED?
01:31:23.353,01:31:24.687,NOPE.
01:31:26.231,01:31:27.523,WHY NOT?
01:31:28.858,01:31:30.902,WHAT'S THE MATTER?
01:31:30.902,01:31:35.907,I HAD A LOT TO THINK ABOUT AFTER YOU LEFT. HMM.
01:31:35.907,01:31:40.620,IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO DO TO A WOMAN MY AGE-- LEAVE HER ALONE WITH HER THOUGHTS.
01:31:47.836,01:31:50.130,"YOU REALLY LOVE HIM, DON'T YOU?"
01:31:54.050,01:31:56.386,"WELL, YOU DO."
01:31:57.804,01:31:59.264,I KNOW.
01:32:00.556,01:32:05.937,"YOU KNOW, THAT, UH, THAT FEELING THAT..."
01:32:05.937,01:32:14.904,YOU HAVE FOR GREGORY-- I DON'T THINK I EVER FELT THAT.
01:32:16.781,01:32:18.741,NOT EVEN FOR YOUR FATHER.
01:32:22.037,01:32:28.293,"IT'S NOT, UH, NOT AN EASY THING FOR ME TO SAY, ESPECIALLY TO YOU."
01:32:30.712,01:32:39.137,"IT'S AN AWFUL THING TO LOOK BACK ON YOUR LIFE AND, UH...REALIZE THAT YOU'VE SETTLED."
01:32:40.763,01:32:45.018,"THE PROBLEM WAS THAT I, UH, I ALWAYS FELT I HAD MORE TIME."
01:32:45.018,01:32:51.233,"I WAS, UH, I MEAN, NOW, I-- INSIDE I-I FEEL..."
01:32:51.233,01:33:00.283,"YOUNG, LIKE A KID, THAT IT'S JUST A BEGINNING, THAT I HAVE EVERYTHING AHEAD OF ME."
01:33:00.283,01:33:01.575,BUT I DON'T.
01:33:03.619,01:33:05.747,SO...
01:33:05.747,01:33:07.749,"I GUESS, UH..."
01:33:07.749,01:33:09.834,I AM JEALOUS.
01:33:11.378,01:33:19.219,"YOU KNOW, PARENTS, UM, THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO HURT THEIR CHILDREN."
01:33:20.762,01:33:23.473,I NEVER WANTED TO HURT YOU.
01:33:23.473,01:33:28.644,"MOM, IT'S-- UH, I'M NOT THAT HURT."
01:33:30.063,01:33:32.941,DO YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN YOU WERE A BABY?
01:33:32.941,01:33:34.650,WHAT?
01:33:34.650,01:33:37.987,THAT YOU LOOKED JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER...
01:33:37.987,01:33:40.574,AND THAT CLAIRE LOOKED LIKE ME.
01:33:41.699,01:33:44.244,WHAT'S THAT?
01:33:46.079,01:33:47.872,MMM.
01:33:47.872,01:33:50.624,"SHE WAS SO PRETTY, EVEN THEN."
01:33:50.624,01:33:55.547,"LOOK AT THOSE EYES, THOSE LIPS."
01:33:55.547,01:33:58.716,"THAT'S NOT CLAIRE, THAT'S YOU."
01:33:58.716,01:34:00.176,ME?
01:34:00.176,01:34:02.845,UH-UH. I NEVER SAW THIS PICTURE.
01:34:02.845,01:34:06.600,I FOUND IT WHEN I WAS REARRANGING THE CLOSETS.
01:34:06.600,01:34:09.436,THIS WAS ME?
01:34:09.436,01:34:11.938,I--I WAS PRETTY?
01:34:11.938,01:34:13.189,MMM.
01:34:13.189,01:34:16.401,YOUR FATHER ADORED YOU.
01:34:16.401,01:34:18.403,BUT YOU KNOW THAT.
01:34:18.403,01:34:21.072,HE NEVER FELT THAT WAY ABOUT CLAIRE.
01:34:21.072,01:34:24.117,ONLY YOU.
01:34:24.117,01:34:27.787,I DON'T THINK HE EVER HELD A BABY TILL YOU CAME...
01:34:27.787,01:34:31.541,AND HE NEVER WANTED TO LET YOU GO.
01:34:37.213,01:34:39.174,"I'M GLAD YOU FOUND THIS, MOM."
01:34:39.174,01:34:41.675,"I KNOW. I AM, TOO."
01:34:44.846,01:34:47.265,SHE WAS VERY PRETTY.
01:34:47.265,01:34:49.934,YOU WERE VERY PRETTY.
01:34:52.145,01:34:53.938,REMEMBER THAT.
01:34:58.901,01:35:00.736,YEAH.
01:35:22.884,01:35:26.262,MARCH IT OUT!
01:35:47.909,01:35:50.620,"OH, GOD."
01:35:53.789,01:35:57.126,THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THAT WARM WELCOME.
01:35:57.126,01:36:00.296,IT'S TRULY AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE IN YOUR COUNTRY.
01:36:00.296,01:36:01.673,HELLO. ROSE?
01:36:01.673,01:36:04.133,I-I WOULD LOVE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
01:36:04.133,01:36:05.635,I NEVER SEEM TO CATCH YOU AT HOME.
01:36:05.635,01:36:11.600,"I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS, ROSE, AND, BELIEVE ME, I HAVE NO JUDGMENT OVER WHAT HAPPENED."
01:36:11.600,01:36:17.021,WE SHOULD TALK. I'M LEAVING FOR VENICE TOMORROW AND WANTED TO WISH YOU A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
01:36:17.021,01:36:19.274,"I DO HAVE A, UH, A PRESENT FOR YOU."
01:36:19.274,01:36:22.444,IT'S A WEEK AT A BASEBALL CAMP.
01:36:22.444,01:36:25.863,"ROSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS COLOR?"
01:36:40.086,01:36:42.171,"ROSE, ARE YOU THERE?"
01:36:46.718,01:36:48.553,HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HER?
01:36:48.553,01:36:51.055,APPARENTLY CANCELED HER SUMMER CLASSES.
01:36:51.055,01:36:53.099,HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
01:36:53.099,01:36:55.351,SHE SAID ROSE TOOK A COUPLE OF MONTHS OFF.
01:36:55.351,01:36:58.438,"ROSE, HERE, TRY THIS ONE."
01:36:58.438,01:37:00.814,"NO. I LIKE THE BLACK ONE, AND I NEED A SIZE 6."
01:37:03.735,01:37:06.362,I-I'M VERY SURPRISED.
01:37:06.362,01:37:10.032,I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW CHILDISHLY YOU'RE BEHAVING.
01:37:10.032,01:37:12.201,"NOW, HOW DID SHE FINALLY PERSUADE YOU TO COME?"
01:37:12.201,01:37:14.329,"OH, IT'S A LONG STORY."
01:37:14.329,01:37:15.913,I'VE CHANGED MY PLANS.
01:37:15.913,01:37:20.335,"I'M COMING HOME RIGHT AFTER LONDON, WHICH PUTS ME IN NEW YORK NEXT MONDAY."
01:37:20.335,01:37:27.550,"UH, MY NUMBER HERE IS 0171-257-7355."
01:37:27.550,01:37:33.014,"UH, ALL PRIME NUMBERS, BY THE WAY."
01:37:45.026,01:37:46.319,HELLO?
01:37:59.624,01:38:01.751,"ROSE, YOU HERE?"
01:38:08.924,01:38:11.427,ROSE?
01:38:11.427,01:38:12.928,I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.
01:38:37.370,01:38:39.997,"MAY I HAVE A GLASS, TOO, PLEASE?"
01:39:03.688,01:39:07.149,"GOOD TO SEE YOU, GREG."
01:39:07.149,01:39:11.237,UH...UH...
01:39:11.237,01:39:13.573,ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
01:39:13.573,01:39:16.325,"O-OH, J-J-JUST A LITTLE DIZZY."
01:39:16.325,01:39:18.202,"THE, UM, TRAVELING DOESN'T AGREE WITH ME."
01:39:18.202,01:39:20.747,MMM. YOU NEED A GLASS OF WATER?
01:39:20.747,01:39:22.415,W-WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
01:39:22.415,01:39:25.460,NOTHING. I JUST MADE A FEW CHANGES.
01:39:25.460,01:39:27.545,WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR?
01:39:27.545,01:39:29.923,I LIGHTENED IT.
01:39:29.923,01:39:32.759,AND YOUR FACE?
01:39:32.759,01:39:35.428,YOU'RE WEARING MAKEUP.
01:39:35.428,01:39:38.807,"YEAH, WELL, WOMEN DO WEAR MAKEUP FROM TIME TO TIME, GREG."
01:39:38.807,01:39:42.101,"IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD SURGERY OR ANYTHING, ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER OFFERED."
01:39:42.101,01:39:44.896,"BUT YOU NEVER, UH-- YOU HUNGRY?"
01:39:44.896,01:39:51.110,"Y-YOU NEVER WORE MAKEUP, UH-- I KNOW, THE-- THE NO-FRILLS GIRL, RIGHT?"
01:39:51.110,01:39:53.655,"WELL, LIKE I SAID, I'VE MADE A FEW CHANGES."
01:39:53.655,01:39:55.072,"AND YOU LOST WEIGHT, TOO?"
01:39:55.072,01:39:56.282,"WELL, THANK YOU."
01:39:56.282,01:39:58.910,"NOW, THESE HAVE NO OIL OR BUTTER."
01:39:58.910,01:40:01.370,"TRUST ME, IT'S DELICIOUS."
01:40:01.370,01:40:04.415,A-AMONG OTHER THINGS.
01:40:04.415,01:40:07.585,WHAT HAVE I DONE?
01:40:07.585,01:40:09.838,I DIDN'T NAME NAMES BEFORE A SENATE COMMITTEE.
01:40:09.838,01:40:14.968,"WELL, FORGIVE ME, BUT YOU DON'T RETURN MY CALLS, YOU COMPLETELY CUT ME OFF, AND THEN I RETURN TO FIND THIS."
01:40:14.968,01:40:20.974,"I'M, UH, UH-- UH, I'M-- WHAT?"
01:40:20.974,01:40:22.433,SPEECHLESS.
01:40:25.186,01:40:27.188,I GUESS YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
01:40:27.188,01:40:29.190,DON'T LIKE IT?
01:40:29.190,01:40:31.108,I'M IN SHOCK.
01:40:31.108,01:40:34.487,I COME HOME TO FIND A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WOMAN IN MY APARTMENT.
01:40:34.487,01:40:35.989,WHY DID YOU DO IT?
01:40:35.989,01:40:38.950,WHY DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU OR ANYBODY?
01:40:38.950,01:40:40.576,I'M NOT ANYBODY.
01:40:40.576,01:40:41.995,COULD'VE FOOLED ME.
01:40:41.995,01:40:44.539,AND I MARRIED A WOMAN WHO LOOKED A CERTAIN WAY.
01:40:44.539,01:40:47.917,"TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I FEEL SORT OF BETRAYED."
01:40:47.917,01:40:50.378,BETRAYED?
01:40:50.378,01:40:53.172,YOU HAD NO RIGHT-- I HAD NO RIGHT?
01:40:53.172,01:40:54.966,WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?
01:40:54.966,01:40:56.718,DO WHAT TO YOU?
01:40:56.718,01:40:59.012,THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
01:40:56.718,01:41:01.514,WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WHAT I LOOK LIKE? YOU NEVER LOOKED AT ME ANYHOW.
01:41:01.514,01:41:05.100,"IF PHYSICAL APPEARANCE DOESN'T MATTER, THEN WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS APPEARANCE?"
01:41:05.100,01:41:10.648,"I HAPPEN TO LIKE THE WAY I LOOK, AND I'M SORRY IF IT UPSETS YOUR MATHEMATICAL EQUATION."
01:41:10.648,01:41:14.360,"HANDSOME, FRIGHTENED MAN MARRIES UNATTRACTIVE, DESPERATE WOMAN."
01:41:14.360,01:41:16.237,IS THAT HOW THE AD READ?
01:41:16.237,01:41:19.490,"NO, NO, IT'S SIMPLY THAT I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE."
01:41:19.490,01:41:21.951,I-I'M SORRY.
01:41:21.951,01:41:23.995,I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO IT.
01:41:23.995,01:41:25.955,"NO, YOU DON'T."
01:41:25.955,01:41:28.875,YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET USED TO ANYTHING.
01:41:28.875,01:41:30.418,W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
01:41:30.418,01:41:34.881,GREGORY...I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE.
01:41:36.049,01:41:37.633,I-I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
01:41:37.633,01:41:41.429,UM-- I...
01:41:41.429,01:41:43.890,I REALLY WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
01:41:43.890,01:41:48.728,I SETTLED FOR SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T WANT.
01:41:48.728,01:41:53.066,"I THOUGHT I COULD LIVE WITH THAT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ENOUGH, BUT, UH, I LIED."
01:41:53.066,01:41:55.526,"I LIED TO MYSELF, I LIED TO YOU."
01:41:55.526,01:41:59.739,"TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I THINK YOUR THEORIES ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS..."

01:42:01.449,01:42:04.827,I BELIEVE IN LOVE AND LUST AND SEX AND ROMANCE.
01:42:04.827,01:42:08.873,I DON'T WANT EVERYTHING TO ADD UP TO SOME PERFECT EQUATION.
01:42:08.873,01:42:10.416,I WANT MESS AND CHAOS.
01:42:10.416,01:42:13.711,I WANT SOMEONE TO GO CRAZY OUT OF HIS MIND FOR ME.
01:42:13.711,01:42:16.547,I WANT TO FEEL PASSION AND HEAT AND SWEAT AND MADNESS.
01:42:16.547,01:42:21.052,I WANT VALENTINES AND CUPIDS AND ALL THAT CRAP.
01:42:21.052,01:42:29.351,"AND I WANT TO THANK YOU, GREG, BECAUSE YOU FORCED ME TO LOOK AT THINGS I WAS TOO LAZY OR TOO SCARED TO LOOK AT."
01:42:29.351,01:42:37.234,"I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE ALL THIS TIME I KEPT UP THIS RIDICULOUS FANTASY THAT YOU, LIKE ALEX, WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH ME?"
01:42:37.234,01:42:39.112,I KNOW.
01:42:39.112,01:42:41.614,IT WAS UNFAIR OF ME TO THINK YOU'D CHANGE.
01:42:39.112,01:42:49.705,"BUT I THINK-- I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, AND JUST LET ME FINISH-- BUT ROSE--ROSE--ROSE-- I FEEL-- YOU FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT YOUR BELIEFS."
01:42:49.705,01:42:51.582,I'M SORRY THAT I BROKE OUR AGREEMENT.
01:42:51.582,01:42:54.502,IT'S JUST THAT I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
01:42:54.502,01:43:01.926,"ROSE, I FEEL THAT-- I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL BAD, BECAUSE I'M NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU ANYMORE."
01:43:05.096,01:43:07.348,WHAT?
01:43:07.348,01:43:11.894,"WHICH, IRONICALLY, MAKES ME PERFECT FOR THIS MARRIAGE, EXCEPT NOW I DON'T WANT IT."
01:43:18.442,01:43:23.489,"SUDDENLY DINNER DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SUCH A GOOD IDEA, DOES IT?"
01:43:26.199,01:43:29.745,I SHOULD-- I SHOULD GO.
01:43:31.122,01:43:33.206,W-W-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
01:43:33.206,01:43:34.667,YOUR MOTHER'S?
01:43:34.667,01:43:37.170,JUST UNTIL I FIND MY OWN PLACE.
01:43:38.754,01:43:42.550,I HOPE AT SOME POINT WE CAN PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF...
01:43:42.550,01:43:43.968,AS FRIENDS.
01:43:43.968,01:43:46.971,FRIENDS?
01:43:46.971,01:43:51.475,YOU'RE THE FIRST MAN WHO WANTED TO MARRY ME...
01:43:53.853,01:43:56.480,CAN I CALL YOU TOMORROW?
01:43:59.400,01:44:01.569,WHAT FOR?
01:44:04.155,01:44:06.157,OHH.
01:44:06.157,01:44:07.533,OHH.
01:45:43.087,01:45:46.882,I DON'T THINK HE'S READY FOR ME.
01:45:46.882,01:45:50.385,STILL CAN'T GET USED TO SEEING YOU LIKE THIS.
01:45:50.385,01:45:52.180,SORT OF UNNERVING.
01:45:52.180,01:45:54.056,THANKS.
01:45:54.056,01:45:58.227,"MAKES YOU JUST LIKE THE REST OF US, DOESN'T IT? YOU'LL SEE."
01:45:58.227,01:46:04.150,"NOW YOU'LL SPEND AN EXTRA HOUR IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT, AS IF IT'LL MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE."
01:46:04.150,01:46:10.614,NOW YOU'LL BE THE ONE TO WALK INTO A ROOM AND SCAN IT FOR WHO LOOKS BETTER THAN YOU AND WHO DOESN'T.
01:46:10.614,01:46:20.291,"AND AS THE YEARS GO BY, THE NUMBERS CHANGE, TILL ONE DAY YOU WALK INTO A ROOM AND YOU'RE THE LAST WOMAN ANY MAN NOTICES."
01:46:21.334,01:46:23.794,ROSE?
01:46:23.794,01:46:26.964,MY GOD. ROSE!

01:46:28.757,01:46:32.261,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU. MY GOD!
01:46:32.261,01:46:34.013,"ALEX, GET A FREAKIN' GRIP."
01:46:34.013,01:46:36.098,YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE.
01:46:36.098,01:46:38.934,DOESN'T SHE LOOK INCREDIBLE?
01:46:38.934,01:46:40.311,CAN I HAVE ANOTHER DRINK?
01:47:15.304,01:47:17.890,I THOUGHT YOU HATED SALAD.
01:47:17.890,01:47:22.603,I JUST CAN'T EAT A BIG CHEESEBURGER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ANYMORE.
01:47:22.603,01:47:24.605,DOESN'T IT BLOAT YOU?
01:47:24.605,01:47:27.024,YEAH.
01:47:27.024,01:47:33.197,"ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT IT WENT REALLY WELL WITH THE SPARE RIBS I HAD FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING."
01:47:37.285,01:47:38.994,WHAT'S THE MATTER?
01:47:42.706,01:47:46.294,"I JUST THOUGHT WE'D ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME BOAT, YOU KNOW?"
01:47:46.294,01:47:48.337,"IT MADE IT EASIER, SOMEHOW."
01:47:48.337,01:47:50.589,I KNOW.
01:47:54.509,01:47:56.429,TELL YOU WHAT.
01:47:56.429,01:48:00.599,I'LL GIVE YOU HALF MY SALAD IF YOU GIVE ME HALF YOUR BURGER.
01:48:03.644,01:48:04.979,WE'LL NEED SOME MORE DRESSING.
01:48:04.979,01:48:06.397,DEFINITELY.
01:48:06.397,01:48:07.731,WAITER!
01:48:15.030,01:48:21.203,THE ONE THING THAT MAKES A LASTING IMPRESSION IS YOUR SMILE.
01:48:22.537,01:48:26.125,"IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST PEOPLE, YOUR APPEARANCE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU."
01:48:26.125,01:48:31.130,"WE ALL SPEND SO MUCH TIME, ENERGY, AND MONEY IN AN EFFORT TO LOOK OUR BEST."
01:48:31.130,01:48:32.673,YEAH.
01:48:32.673,01:48:56.738,WE ALL WANT TO BE ATTRACTIVE-- HELLO.
01:48:56.738,01:48:58.157,"OH, HI, ALEX."
01:48:58.157,01:48:59.783,HOW ARE YOU?
01:48:59.783,01:49:02.119,"OH, I'M OKAY. I'M TRYING TO GET ON WITH MY LIFE."
01:49:02.119,01:49:03.578,"OH, GOOD, GOOD."
01:49:03.578,01:49:05.498,WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
01:49:05.498,01:49:07.333,GONE?
01:49:07.333,01:49:09.210,GONE WHERE?
01:49:09.210,01:49:16.217,"I CAME HOME TO SURPRISE HER DURING LUNCH, AND I FOUND HER IN BED WITH HER MASSEUR."
01:49:16.217,01:49:18.093,"IT'S MY OWN FAULT, REALLY."
01:49:18.093,01:49:20.262,CLAIRE HATES SURPRISES.
01:49:20.262,01:49:22.139,"ALEX, I'M REALLY SORRY."
01:49:22.139,01:49:24.350,"NO, NO."
01:49:24.350,01:49:26.894,I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE WASN'T HAPPY.
01:49:26.894,01:49:29.980,I DON'T KNOW HOW I COULD'VE LOVED HER ANY MORE THAN I DID.
01:49:29.980,01:49:33.359,I DON'T THINK IT WOULD'VE MATTERED HOW MUCH YOU LOVED HER.
01:49:33.359,01:49:37.905,"ROSE, DID YOU KNOW THAT CLAIRE WAS JEALOUS OF YOU?"
01:49:37.905,01:49:40.949,WHAT? JEALOUS OF ME?
01:49:40.949,01:49:44.245,SHE USED TO GET SO MAD AT ME EVERY TIME I'D TALK ABOUT YOU.
01:49:44.245,01:49:47.748,SHE THOUGHT I HAD A SECRET CRUSH ON YOU.
01:49:47.748,01:49:50.543,MAYBE SHE WAS RIGHT.
01:49:55.089,01:49:57.132,DO YOU WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME?
01:49:58.300,01:50:00.677,WHAT?
01:50:00.677,01:50:02.846,I'M ASKING YOU IF YOU WANT TO HAVE DINNER WITH ME.
01:50:02.846,01:50:07.351,"I, UH..."
01:50:07.351,01:50:09.228,I'LL HAVE TO ASK CLAIRE.
01:50:09.228,01:50:10.521,ALL RIGHT.
01:50:10.521,01:50:12.147,OKAY.
01:50:12.147,01:50:15.025,D! CONGRATULATIONS.
01:50:15.025,01:50:17.861,I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT TWIN PRIMES.
01:50:17.861,01:50:20.489,I'M EXPLAINING IT TO YOU.
01:50:20.489,01:50:28.038,DON'T YOU KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO REMOVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS FROM AN INFINITE SET AND STILL HAVE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS LEFT OVER?
01:50:28.038,01:50:29.957,WE'VE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON THIS ALREADY!
01:50:29.957,01:50:33.168,GOD! MY WIFE UNDERSTOOD THIS ON OUR FIRST DATE!
01:50:36.713,01:50:38.507,CLASS DISMISSED.

01:50:58.860,01:51:00.237,DID YOU COOK IT YOURSELF?
01:51:00.237,01:51:02.281,"YES, I DID."
01:51:02.281,01:51:04.116,WHAT A LIAR.
01:51:04.116,01:51:06.743,"YES, I AM."
01:51:07.995,01:51:09.538,MMM.
01:51:11.373,01:51:15.710,"I WAS THINKING, I ONLY SMOKE WHEN I'M WITH YOU."
01:51:15.710,01:51:17.171,WONDER WHY.
01:51:24.637,01:51:28.307,I CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THE OTHER DAY...
01:51:29.350,01:51:30.934,FOR TONIGHT.
01:51:32.853,01:51:34.771,YOU'RE SUCH AN INSPIRATION...
01:51:36.190,01:51:43.322,"THE WAY YOU'VE CHANGED-- EVOLVED, I GUESS, IS A BETTER WORD..."
01:51:44.781,01:51:48.035,INTO THIS...BEAUTIFUL...
01:51:49.537,01:51:51.205,SMART...

01:52:04.343,01:52:07.555,I THINK I MUST HAVE LOVED YOU ALL ALONG.
01:52:07.555,01:52:09.764,I JUST...
01:52:09.764,01:52:11.684,DIDN'T KNOW IT.
01:52:13.477,01:52:15.396,WHAT AN IDIOT.
01:52:21.527,01:52:24.154,"HANNAH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS."
01:52:24.154,01:52:27.032,"HANNAH, SHE CAN'T NOT TALK TO ME FOREVER!"
01:52:27.032,01:52:29.951,"I-I'VE GOT THE-- GREGORY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"
01:52:29.951,01:52:33.205,THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO HER.
01:52:33.205,01:52:34.873,IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.
01:52:55.977,01:52:58.980,SHE'S NOT HERE.
01:52:58.980,01:53:02.317,"LOOK, I MIGHT AS WELL TELL YOU."
01:53:02.317,01:53:03.902,ALEX?
01:53:03.902,01:53:06.905,SHE'S WITH HIM TONIGHT.
01:53:06.905,01:53:14.580,"I'M SURE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SHE'S ALWAYS CARED FOR HIM, SO LIKE I SAID, I SEE NO POINT IN YOUR PURSUING THIS ANY FURTHER."
01:53:44.693,01:53:48.113,"WHOA, WHOA, WHOA."
01:53:48.113,01:53:52.200,WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY YOU MUST'VE LOVED ME ALL ALONG BUT JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT?
01:53:52.200,01:53:55.454,I DON'T KNOW.
01:53:55.454,01:53:59.708,YOU WERE DIFFERENT THEN.
01:53:59.708,01:54:02.544,SO HOW COULD YOU HAVE LOVED ME THEN?
01:53:59.708,01:54:05.380,"WELL, I-I-- I LOVED YOU BECAUSE OF WHO YOU WERE, NOT BECAUSE I WANTED WHO YOU WERE."
01:54:05.380,01:54:08.841,SO NOW YOU WANT WHO I AM BECAUSE I'M NOT WHO I WAS ANYMORE?
01:54:10.427,01:54:11.844,OKAY...
01:54:11.844,01:54:15.683,"WHAT? ROSE, WHAT?"
01:54:15.683,01:54:17.476,YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
01:54:17.476,01:54:21.188,I HAVE DREAMT ABOUT THIS MOMENT FROM THE FIRST DAY WE MET.
01:54:21.188,01:54:29.780,"I'VE PLAYED IT OUT A MILLION TIMES IN MY MIND-- HOW YOU'D LOOK, WHAT YOU'D SAY, WHAT YOU'D THINK, AND GUESS WHAT."
01:54:29.780,01:54:31.406,YOU WERE BETTER IN MY HEAD.
01:54:31.406,01:54:33.033,MAYBE I JUST HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
01:54:33.033,01:54:35.577,"NO, NO, IT'S NOT YOU."
01:54:35.577,01:54:38.163,I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING!
01:54:38.163,01:54:41.041,I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT I WOULD FEEL.
01:54:41.041,01:54:44.378,I WAS ONLY THINKING ABOUT YOU. I ONLY WANTED TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
01:54:44.378,01:54:46.338,I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.
01:54:46.338,01:54:49.758,"OH, BUT YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, ROSE. YOU ARE!"
01:54:49.758,01:54:51.218,"I KNOW, I KNOW!"
01:54:51.218,01:54:54.221,"BUT, ALEX, YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME."
01:54:59.434,01:55:01.478,OKAY.
01:55:19.705,01:55:22.165,I'M SO DIZZY.
01:55:22.165,01:55:25.168,"I WAS IN THE APARTMENT ALL ALONE, HENRY."
01:55:25.168,01:55:27.212,I--I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
01:55:27.212,01:55:29.130,"COME ON, GIVE ME YOUR SHOE."
01:55:29.130,01:55:31.007,"I'M SORRY, HENRY."
01:55:31.007,01:55:33.427,YOU'LL JUST STAY HERE TONIGHT. COME ON.
01:55:33.427,01:55:35.345,"OH, HENRY."
01:55:35.345,01:55:36.680,I LOVE ROSE.
01:55:36.680,01:55:38.348,I KNOW.
01:55:38.348,01:55:46.231,"BUT I LOVE THE OLD ROSE, THE ONE WITH NO MAKEUP AND BAGGY CLOTHES WHO LOVES THE PERFECT BITE."
01:55:46.231,01:55:48.442,I LOVE HER.
01:55:48.442,01:55:55.282,"I-IT'S NOT BASED ON PASSION, ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT, OR--OR LUST..."
01:55:55.282,01:56:14.843,"ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT, O-OR EVEN PHYSICAL ATTRACTION, BECAUSE SHE WASN'T, UH-- UH, A-ALTHOUGH I THOUGHT SHE WAS QUITE BEAUTIFUL-- HER EYES, HER MOUTH, THE WAY SHE HELD HERSELF, THE WAY SHE MADE FUN OF HERSELF."
01:56:14.843,01:56:17.345,SHE EATS CARROTS NOW!
01:56:17.345,01:56:19.347,ISN'T THAT TRAGIC?
01:56:19.347,01:56:21.266,MMM.
01:56:21.266,01:56:23.602,WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
01:56:23.602,01:56:31.151,"DO YOU KNOW THAT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN WITH 11 DIFFERENT WOMEN, MOST OF THEM HALF MY AGE?"
01:56:31.151,01:56:34.655,NOT ONE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR I UNDERSTOOD.
01:56:34.655,01:56:37.658,"NOW, I DON'T DATE THESE GIRLS BECAUSE THEY'RE WELL-READ."
01:56:37.658,01:56:40.410,I GAVE ONE A COPY OF A FAREWELL TO ARMS.
01:56:40.410,01:56:42.078,SHE THOUGHT IT WAS A DIET BOOK.
01:56:46.249,01:56:47.584,MMM.
01:57:06.144,01:57:09.982,CAN I HELP YOU?
01:57:09.982,01:57:12.985,IT'S KINDA LATE TO BE VISITING PEOPLE.
01:57:12.985,01:57:16.112,I DON'T BELIEVE MISS MORGAN WOULD CARE TO BE DISTURBED AT THIS HOUR.
01:57:16.112,01:57:17.990,YOU DON'T BELIEVE?
01:57:17.990,01:57:20.116,I BELIEVE!
01:57:20.116,01:57:22.369,I KNOW HER A LOT BETTER THAN YOU DO.
01:57:24.621,01:57:27.123,ROSE!
01:57:27.123,01:57:29.167,ROSE!
01:57:29.167,01:57:30.878,DO YOU HEAR THAT?
01:57:30.878,01:57:33.213,TO CALL THE POLICE!
01:57:33.213,01:57:34.965,WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
01:57:34.965,01:57:38.259,GO HOME!
