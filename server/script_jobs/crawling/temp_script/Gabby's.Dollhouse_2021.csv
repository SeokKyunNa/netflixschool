00:00:47.505,00:00:52.177,Hey. Pandy and I are playing restaurant. I'm the waiter and he is the customer.
00:00:53.261,00:00:56.264,"Evening, sir. Welcome to Gabby's Cat Cafe."
00:00:56.723,00:01:01.102,"For our special tonight, we are serving the uh... pickle."
00:01:01.394,00:01:02.771,Would you like to try that?
00:01:03.730,00:01:05.857,"Excellent choice, sir."
00:01:06.441,00:01:09.527,"Very recommended, and my personal favorite."
00:01:09.819,00:01:10.820,Coming right up.
00:01:12.155,00:01:14.616,"Here you are, sir. Please enjoy."
00:01:16.826,00:01:19.162,Ooh! You know what that sound means.
00:01:19.454,00:01:21.581,It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:21.831,00:01:23.541,"Come on, Pandy. Let's go."
00:01:34.010,00:01:38.056,Ooh! I can't wait to see what's inside the Meow Meow Mailbox today.
00:01:40.683,00:01:43.186,Ooh!
00:01:43.269,00:01:45.188,A golden box!
00:01:45.980,00:01:48.983,Should we open it? Of course we should!
00:01:57.200,00:01:59.661,It's a kitty-coin purse! See?
00:02:04.124,00:02:05.291,Ooh!
00:02:05.375,00:02:06.668,Coins!
00:02:09.003,00:02:11.005,See? Here's heads.
00:02:14.342,00:02:16.803,Let's see how many we have. OK.
00:02:17.220,00:02:20.265,"We have one, two..."
00:02:21.391,00:02:25.687,"three, four, five!"
00:02:26.187,00:02:29.190,"Five kitty coins. Hey, wait a minute."
00:02:29.274,00:02:32.861,"There's something else in here, too. It's an invitation!"
00:02:33.153,00:02:36.823,To DJ Catnip's grand opening of the Music Store!
00:02:41.286,00:02:42.996,We have our kitty coins.
00:02:43.788,00:02:44.831,Let's go.
00:02:45.665,00:02:46.666,Come on.
00:02:48.501,00:02:50.879,Ooh! Look all the decorations!
00:02:50.962,00:02:53.923,DJ Catnip's getting set up for the grand opening.
00:02:54.007,00:02:55.675,"We're coming, DJ Catnip."
00:02:56.342,00:02:58.970,Time to get tiny.
00:03:09.230,00:03:11.399,What are you waiting for? Come on in!
00:03:12.609,00:03:14.485,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:03:19.782,00:03:22.035,"Hey, DJ Catnip. Happy Store Day!"
00:03:22.118,00:03:24.579,"Hey, hey! What's up, kitty-cats?"
00:03:24.662,00:03:26.331,"Happy Store Day to you, too."
00:03:26.414,00:03:30.043,I'm still setting up for the grand opening of my Music Store.
00:03:32.921,00:03:34.631,Who else is playing store today?
00:03:35.089,00:03:41.679,"Well, Cakey's got his Bakery, Baby Box's Craft Store is open, and Kitty Fairy's Flower Shop is blooming."
00:03:41.971,00:03:46.017,"I'm opening up very soon, but you two can have a little sneak peek if you want."
00:03:50.980,00:03:52.565,You can bang on a drum.
00:03:56.611,00:04:00.114,I have all kinds of instruments to help you find your groove.
00:04:00.448,00:04:01.491,Whoa!
00:04:01.574,00:04:06.162,Look at all these meow-mazing instruments! I want to learn how to play an instrument.
00:04:06.246,00:04:10.208,"That's a cool idea, Pandy. Then we can all jam together."
00:04:10.500,00:04:12.210,What instrument calls to you?
00:04:16.297,00:04:17.423,What is that one?
00:04:17.966,00:04:21.594,Oh. That one's groovy. It's called the melodicat.
00:04:21.678,00:04:24.681,"Instead of musical notes, it plays kitty-cat notes."
00:04:27.892,00:04:32.272,Check this out. You can sing into it and get all kinds of silly little voices.
00:04:39.612,00:04:43.157,"Pandy, I think this is the purr-fect instrument for you."
00:04:46.703,00:04:49.038,I would love to learn how to play that.
00:04:49.205,00:04:53.084,"Pandy, we can use our kitty coins to buy you an instrument."
00:04:53.167,00:04:56.421,Really? I would love to learn how to play that melodicat.
00:04:56.504,00:04:57.714,Then let's do it!
00:05:03.177,00:05:04.178,Uh-oh.
00:05:04.679,00:05:06.681,We only have five kitty coins.
00:05:07.682,00:05:09.767,"-We don't have enough. -Oh, no!"
00:05:10.018,00:05:12.854,Maybe we can find a way to earn more coins.
00:05:12.937,00:05:14.147,Let's think.
00:05:15.648,00:05:16.691,I got it!
00:05:16.774,00:05:19.694,We could do jobs to earn more kitty coins.
00:05:19.777,00:05:21.154,"Great thinking, Gabby."
00:05:21.237,00:05:23.656,I'm willing to work hard to get something I love.
00:05:23.740,00:05:26.034,"I like your cat-titude, Pandy."
00:05:26.242,00:05:29.787,I ordered a special cake from Cakey's Bakery for my grand opening.
00:05:29.871,00:05:33.207,I bet he could use some baker's helpers right about now.
00:05:33.666,00:05:35.168,"Thanks, DJ Catnip."
00:05:35.335,00:05:39.088,-To the kitchen! -We'll be back for the grand opening.
00:05:39.172,00:05:41.215,"Alright, kitty-cats! See you soon!"
00:05:50.183,00:05:52.310,Welcome to Cakey's Bakery.
00:05:52.393,00:05:53.436,"Hey, Cakey!"
00:05:53.519,00:05:57.940,We're looking for jobs to earn some kitty coins so Pandy can buy a new instrument.
00:05:58.107,00:06:00.193,We heard you might need some baker's helpers?
00:06:00.276,00:06:02.195,"Oh, sweetness!"
00:06:02.278,00:06:06.199,I could definitely use some help with a specialty cake order.
00:06:06.949,00:06:08.117,You're hired!
00:06:08.326,00:06:10.620,Put these on and follow me.
00:06:14.582,00:06:21.380,"Carlita's Delivery Service is going to be here soon to pick up the finished cake, and there's still so much to do!"
00:06:21.464,00:06:22.673,Meowzer!
00:06:22.840,00:06:24.759,That looks delicious!
00:06:25.134,00:06:26.177,How can we help?
00:06:26.469,00:06:34.685,"We need to frost these three drum cakes, decorate them, and then stack them up so our finished cake looks just like this one."
00:06:34.894,00:06:36.938,Are you ready to Bakey with Cakey?
00:06:37.188,00:06:38.815,You bet we are!
00:06:39.107,00:06:40.358,OK!
00:06:40.525,00:06:44.112,We need to frost each drum with the right-colored frosting.
00:06:44.403,00:06:47.198,"Gabby, you frost the biggest cake with blue."
00:06:47.281,00:06:48.116,Got it!
00:06:48.199,00:06:51.244,"Pandy, you frost the medium cake with red."
00:06:51.452,00:06:52.453,On it!
00:06:53.454,00:06:56.082,And I'll use the purple frosting for this little guy.
00:06:56.290,00:06:59.418,"The first step, bakers, is to frost the cake."
00:07:12.723,00:07:13.933,Great. OK.
00:07:14.016,00:07:17.103,"Now, each drum cake layer is decorated differently."
00:07:17.270,00:07:20.148,"Let's start with the top drum. What do we need, Gabby?"
00:07:30.366,00:07:32.118,"Let's do this, bakers!"
00:07:42.670,00:07:44.255,Which color comes next?
00:07:49.510,00:07:52.096,Moving on to layer two. Gabby?
00:07:52.263,00:07:55.516,Ooh! This one has a pattern of musical instruments.
00:07:56.934,00:07:58.227,This pattern goes...
00:08:06.277,00:08:07.945,Let's do this!
00:08:17.788,00:08:19.040,What comes next?
00:08:26.255,00:08:27.840,"Nice work, bakers!"
00:08:27.924,00:08:30.760,Now let's decorate the bottom layer. Gabby?
00:08:39.727,00:08:41.103,Let's give it a go.
00:08:59.288,00:09:00.706,What comes next?
00:09:06.712,00:09:08.005,Ta-da!
00:09:08.339,00:09:09.382,We did it!
00:09:09.882,00:09:11.342,Now we stack them up.
00:09:22.520,00:09:24.564,One more thing.
00:09:26.023,00:09:27.817,Drumsticks on top.
00:09:30.987,00:09:33.239,Yay! Look at what we made!
00:09:33.322,00:09:35.116,That cake is paw-tastic!
00:09:35.283,00:09:40.621,DJ Catnip's definitely gonna groove when he sees this.
00:09:40.830,00:09:43.416,I couldn't have done it without you guys.
00:09:43.499,00:09:44.667,Baker's hug!
00:09:48.337,00:09:49.755,"Thank you, bakers."
00:09:49.839,00:09:53.342,"And for all your hard work, two kitty coins."
00:09:53.676,00:09:54.802,"Thanks, Cakey."
00:09:55.011,00:09:58.055,Do you think we have enough kitty coins for the melodicat now?
00:09:58.264,00:10:01.058,Let's find out. Let's count those kitty coins.
00:10:01.309,00:10:04.270,"So, we had five kitty coins."
00:10:05.354,00:10:07.481,And we just earned two more.
00:10:07.940,00:10:09.400,"Six, seven."
00:10:11.193,00:10:13.654,How many kitty coins do we still need?
00:10:17.783,00:10:20.328,We need three more kitty coins.
00:10:22.079,00:10:24.749,Beep-beep! Carlita's Delivery Service!
00:10:24.832,00:10:26.709,I'm here to pick up a cake.
00:10:26.959,00:10:28.169,Right over here.
00:10:28.419,00:10:30.755,That's one super-special cake!
00:10:30.838,00:10:32.757,Do you think DJ Catnip will like it?
00:10:32.840,00:10:34.800,Are you kitten me? He's gonna love it.
00:10:35.217,00:10:41.098,"Hey, Carlita, we're looking for jobs to earn extra kitty coins so Pandy can buy an instrument."
00:10:41.349,00:10:43.643,Know anyone else who needs help in their store?
00:10:43.976,00:10:47.021,I'm on my way to bring an order to Baby Box's Craft Store.
00:10:47.104,00:10:50.024,"It's a rush order, so I bet she's gonna need some help."
00:10:50.107,00:10:51.108,Hop in!
00:10:52.693,00:10:53.736,"Bye, Cakey."
00:10:53.986,00:10:56.197,"Bye, guys. Good luck!"
00:10:56.405,00:10:57.615,Seatbelts on!
00:11:06.165,00:11:09.293,Honk-honk! I've got an order here for Baby Box.
00:11:15.299,00:11:16.467,"Hey, guys."
00:11:16.717,00:11:22.681,"DJ Catnip needs three specialty shakers, and uh... it's kind of a rush order."
00:11:22.765,00:11:25.559,He needs them for the grand opening of his Music Store.
00:11:25.643,00:11:29.647,"Alright, guys, I've got to deliver the cake, but I'll be back soon for the shakers."
00:11:29.730,00:11:30.731,Honk-honk!
00:11:32.817,00:11:36.320,Phew! That doesn't give me much time to make these shakers.
00:11:36.404,00:11:37.947,Maybe we can help.
00:11:38.030,00:11:41.492,Pandy and I are looking for jobs to earn some extra kitty coins.
00:11:41.617,00:11:44.328,Really? Craft-errific!
00:11:49.041,00:11:50.251,"Alright, team."
00:11:50.334,00:11:53.254,"Pandy, you make the purple cat shaker."
00:11:53.504,00:11:56.507,"Gabby, you make the green shaker."
00:11:56.924,00:12:00.511,And I'll make the cat shaker that looks just like Pillow Cat.
00:12:00.719,00:12:02.596,Let's get crafting!
00:12:03.305,00:12:06.183,"OK, the first thing we need are toilet paper rolls."
00:12:06.267,00:12:08.102,"Luckily, I have a full supply."
00:12:08.727,00:12:13.149,"With our trusty glue stick and some imagination, we can make any creation."
00:12:38.507,00:12:41.177,You two are such great crafters.
00:12:41.385,00:12:45.556,"Here, two kitty coins for all your craft-errific help!"
00:12:45.639,00:12:49.643,"Thanks, Baby Box. Let's see how many kitty coins we have now."
00:13:07.953,00:13:09.955,We only need one more kitty coin?
00:13:13.250,00:13:16.212,"Well, I'm just about to head up to Kitty Fairy's Flower Shop."
00:13:16.295,00:13:20.132,-I'm sure she could use some help. -Ooh! I love flowers.
00:13:20.216,00:13:23.636,Working in the Flower Shop sounds cat-tastic!
00:13:23.719,00:13:26.013,To the Fairy Tail Garden!
00:13:26.305,00:13:28.557,-Don't forget your shakers. -Beep-beep!
00:13:28.849,00:13:30.309,"Bye, Baby Box!"
00:13:30.476,00:13:31.852,"Good luck, Pandy!"
00:13:37.316,00:13:40.653,"Hey, Kitty Fairy. I have an order from DJ Catnip."
00:13:45.157,00:13:47.535,...but I'll be back for those flowers. Beep-beep!
00:13:53.123,00:13:57.294,"Kitty Fairy, Pandy and I have been working to earn extra kitty coins."
00:13:57.586,00:13:59.213,-You have? -Yeah!
00:13:59.296,00:14:02.299,We're trying to earn enough kitty coins to buy a melodicat.
00:14:02.383,00:14:05.844,It's this instrument that makes all these paw-tastic cat sounds.
00:14:06.178,00:14:09.682,"Well, I could definitely use some extra hands for this order."
00:14:09.765,00:14:12.184,You two are hired. Welcome aboard!
00:14:13.102,00:14:17.022,DJ Catnip needs one musical bouquet made with singing flowers.
00:14:17.856,00:14:19.692,Flowers that sing?
00:14:19.900,00:14:23.988,"Oh, yes. And luckily, it's singing flower season."
00:14:26.740,00:14:33.622,"Singing flowers are very particular, so we have to make the bouquet in the right order, or else they won't sing a song."
00:14:33.706,00:14:37.668,I'm going to need help selecting the right flowers. Get ready to listen.
00:14:38.002,00:14:39.587,"We're ready, Kitty Fairy."
00:14:39.795,00:14:42.715,The first flower needs to sound like this.
00:14:44.758,00:14:47.094,Help us find the flowers that sound like...
00:14:56.186,00:14:58.564,Which flowers make the sound we're looking for?
00:15:01.442,00:15:04.695,Yes! These beauties make the sound we need.
00:15:06.864,00:15:08.240,Great listening!
00:15:08.324,00:15:10.200,Get your flower ears ready.
00:15:11.201,00:15:13.913,The next flower we need sounds like this.
00:15:16.123,00:15:17.917,Which flowers sound like...?
00:15:19.335,00:15:20.336,Let's listen.
00:15:26.175,00:15:28.427,Which flowers make the sound we need?
00:15:30.638,00:15:31.722,Alright!
00:15:33.599,00:15:36.101,Two more to go! Here's the next one.
00:15:38.437,00:15:40.773,Which flowers make the sound we need?
00:15:48.697,00:15:49.657,Yes!
00:15:49.907,00:15:52.034,"Come with me, you crooning little cutie."
00:15:53.535,00:15:55.287,Only one flower left.
00:16:00.250,00:16:01.710,Yes! That's it!
00:16:03.337,00:16:04.755,Thank you!
00:16:05.339,00:16:06.715,Wahoo!
00:16:06.799,00:16:08.384,We found them all!
00:16:08.467,00:16:10.970,Wait until DJ Catnip hears this.
00:16:33.492,00:16:36.620,"Thank you, you flow-errific florists, for your help!"
00:16:42.209,00:16:46.797,Three kitty coins for the best feline florists a Kitty Fairy could ask for.
00:16:47.297,00:16:48.674,"Thank you, Kitty Fairy."
00:16:49.008,00:16:51.051,"Yeah, thanks, Kitty Fairy."
00:16:51.218,00:16:54.555,That was the coolest job I have ever had.
00:16:54.638,00:16:57.433,"Pandy, how many kitty coins do we have now?"
00:16:57.850,00:16:59.143,Let's find out.
00:17:01.270,00:17:05.315,"We had nine kitty coins, and we just earned three more."
00:17:05.733,00:17:06.942,Let's count.
00:17:09.403,00:17:11.572,"11, 12."
00:17:14.241,00:17:16.952,My instrument only costs ten kitty coins.
00:17:17.286,00:17:18.620,We have two extra!
00:17:18.787,00:17:23.876,"Ten to spend, one to save, and one to share, to help another kitty in need."
00:17:23.959,00:17:26.754,Yep! And I can buy my instrument now!
00:17:27.046,00:17:29.048,"Congratulations, Pandy."
00:17:31.050,00:17:33.510,"What up, groovy cats and kitties?"
00:17:33.594,00:17:42.352,"It's DJ Catnip here to tell you about the grand opening of DJ Catnip's Music Emporium, located on the bottom floor of Gabby's Dollhouse."
00:17:42.436,00:17:44.354,"In fact, it's opening right now!"
00:17:44.438,00:17:46.148,I'll see you there! Bye!
00:17:46.690,00:17:48.275,-Wow! -Wow!
00:17:48.358,00:17:50.861,Beep-beep! Hop in! We've got to go.
00:18:04.583,00:18:06.960,Let's go get my instrument!
00:18:07.711,00:18:11.465,"Alright, kitty-cats! Thank you all for coming."
00:18:11.548,00:18:16.095,DJ Catnip's Music Store is officially open for business.
00:18:19.098,00:18:22.392,"DJ Catnip, I'll take the melodicat, please."
00:18:22.476,00:18:25.312,"Sure! That will be ten kitty coins, please."
00:18:27.731,00:18:30.442,Here you go. Ten kitty coins.
00:18:30.526,00:18:32.111,I still have two left.
00:18:33.195,00:18:34.321,A-ha!
00:18:35.030,00:18:36.490,"Happy playing, Pandy."
00:18:36.573,00:18:37.574,Yes!
00:18:44.331,00:18:45.415,"Hey, Catnip."
00:18:45.499,00:18:49.503,"I'd like to buy that a-meow-zing cat shaker that looks just like me, please."
00:18:52.339,00:18:54.466,That will be three kitty coins.
00:18:54.633,00:18:56.093,"Oh, stuffing!"
00:18:56.176,00:18:58.345,I only have two kitty coins.
00:18:59.888,00:19:03.433,"Hey! Pillow Cat, I have two extra kitty coins."
00:19:03.517,00:19:06.103,I can give you one to get your cat shaker.
00:19:06.186,00:19:07.437,"Really, Pandy?"
00:19:07.521,00:19:08.856,Absolutely!
00:19:09.064,00:19:11.400,I know how much it means to get an instrument.
00:19:13.735,00:19:15.988,"Oh, thank you so much, Pandy!"
00:19:16.071,00:19:17.239,Yay!
00:19:23.287,00:19:25.122,"Oh, you got it, Pillow Cat."
00:19:27.583,00:19:29.084,"Great job, Pandy."
00:19:29.418,00:19:33.130,You know what? That felt just as good as getting my new melodicat.
00:19:33.213,00:19:37.551,And I still have one kitty coin... to start my savings!
00:19:38.468,00:19:42.931,"OK, now, since evert cat has a new instrument, let's jam!"
00:19:53.525,00:19:54.985,Flower solo!
00:20:00.949,00:20:03.493,Thanks for helping Pandy earn his kitty coins.
00:20:03.577,00:20:05.787,He really does love that melodicat.
00:20:13.795,00:20:16.256,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:29.561,00:20:32.773,Hey! It's DJ Catnip in the house.
00:22:26.053,00:22:28.472,I love making music with DJ Catnip.
00:22:30.599,00:22:32.976,Thanks for helping us earn all those kitty coins.
00:22:33.185,00:22:36.730,"And look, we even have one left over to save."
00:22:37.105,00:22:39.232,See you next time. Bye!
00:00:52.343,00:00:55.847,Sometimes you need to stop what you're doing and have a little snuggle time.
00:00:55.930,00:00:58.266,"It makes everybody feel better. Right, Floyd?"
00:01:04.355,00:01:06.149,You know what that sound means.
00:01:06.232,00:01:08.902,It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery! Come on.
00:01:19.579,00:01:22.290,"Meow Meow Mailbox, what do you have for us today?"
00:01:24.834,00:01:25.877,I think he's ready.
00:01:28.338,00:01:30.673,Check out this kitty-cat box!
00:01:31.299,00:01:33.968,Look at all the leaves and the flowers.
00:01:34.844,00:01:36.179,Let's see what's inside.
00:01:37.972,00:01:38.973,Ooh!
00:01:42.519,00:01:44.729,Look at this little pot!
00:01:45.104,00:01:47.857,It's so realistic and tiny.
00:01:51.736,00:01:53.613,OK. Let's see what else.
00:01:54.823,00:01:57.158,It's a little bag of dirt!
00:01:57.909,00:02:00.328,That is crazy.
00:02:00.703,00:02:02.163,"Wait, there's something else."
00:02:10.880,00:02:12.674,teeny-weeny seed!
00:02:17.137,00:02:19.597,Should we plant it? Yeah!
00:02:20.265,00:02:21.307,OK.
00:02:23.476,00:02:24.477,Let's see.
00:02:25.395,00:02:27.147,Pour in the dirt.
00:02:28.982,00:02:29.983,Alright.
00:02:30.233,00:02:37.323,"Now, for the next step, we take this itty-bitty seed and we plant it, and we put it in the dirt, and we cover it."
00:02:38.158,00:02:40.201,Like that. Right.
00:02:40.577,00:02:43.830,"And last but not least, a little bit of water."
00:02:45.540,00:02:46.374,There.
00:02:47.167,00:02:48.334,And now...
00:02:49.377,00:02:51.004,we wait.
00:02:55.300,00:02:56.676,Hmm.
00:03:03.182,00:03:09.606,"Well, I guess that's because usually seeds take a couple of days, or even weeks to grow."
00:03:11.024,00:03:12.942,Unless...
00:03:13.401,00:03:16.738,Unless you have a magical fairy friend like...
00:03:17.614,00:03:19.032,Kitty Fairy!
00:03:19.115,00:03:24.537,I bet she can use some of her garden magic to make this little seed sprout up right away.
00:03:24.787,00:03:25.788,Come on!
00:03:28.082,00:03:31.085,Time to get tiny.
00:03:39.260,00:03:40.470,Whee!
00:03:42.138,00:03:43.848,Come on in! Hurry!
00:03:45.767,00:03:48.353,Welcome to the Fairy Tail Garden!
00:03:48.519,00:03:51.731,I can't wait to see what this little seed grows into.
00:03:52.815,00:03:54.484,"What do you think it is, Pandy?"
00:03:55.693,00:03:58.029,Where did that little Pandy Paws go?
00:03:58.821,00:03:59.948,Do you see him?
00:04:02.659,00:04:03.743,Hug attack!
00:04:09.040,00:04:12.460,"Hey, Gabby. Hey, Pandy. What a nice surprise."
00:04:12.543,00:04:13.753,"Hey, Kitty Fairy."
00:04:13.836,00:04:14.921,Check this out.
00:04:17.465,00:04:19.509,What's in this adorable little pot?
00:04:19.592,00:04:22.845,It's a seed surprise... even for us.
00:04:23.221,00:04:26.224,"Yeah, and we really want to see what it is."
00:04:26.307,00:04:28.810,We were hoping you could make it grow super fast.
00:04:28.893,00:04:30.561,You know I can!
00:04:30.937,00:04:34.023,It just takes a little... garden magic.
00:04:43.241,00:04:46.035,We'll have this seed blooming in no time.
00:04:46.494,00:04:48.246,You've got to be kitten me!
00:04:48.329,00:04:54.127,"She just made a rain cloud with her tail? Mine just follows me around, looking cute."
00:04:54.877,00:04:56.838,"Pandy, Gabby, look!"
00:05:15.231,00:05:17.358,It's so cute!
00:05:17.608,00:05:21.779,"That's not just any flower, Gabby. That's an Itty Bitty Blossom."
00:05:25.533,00:05:30.330,"Oh, you're just the cutest little Itty Bitty Blossom in the whole world, aren't you?"
00:05:30.538,00:05:33.791,"Yes, you are! Yes, you are, because it's true."
00:05:34.959,00:05:38.129,"Well, she'll only be this little for a short while."
00:05:38.338,00:05:43.384,Itty Bitty Blossoms grow from baby all the way to fully grown in just one day.
00:05:43.593,00:05:45.261,That's cat-tastic!
00:05:45.344,00:05:46.471,Yes.
00:05:46.554,00:05:51.392,"But it means, until then, she'll need to be cared for just like any other baby."
00:05:51.476,00:05:55.313,So we get to take care of an Itty Bitty Blossom today?
00:06:08.326,00:06:11.496,"Whoa! Little flower, big cry."
00:06:11.579,00:06:14.999,"Aww! What's the matter, little Itty Bitty Blossom?"
00:06:16.959,00:06:18.878,Don't worry. I'll cheer her up.
00:06:19.212,00:06:22.298,I have plenty of paw-tastic things in my Pandy Pack.
00:06:38.523,00:06:39.524,Maraca?
00:06:48.324,00:06:51.702,"This weird squishy thing, that when you squish it, its tongue goes..."
00:07:01.838,00:07:03.631,I don't know what else to try.
00:07:07.969,00:07:14.600,"Uh, Kitty Fairy, Itty Bitty Blossom is sucking on my thumb, and I'm not sure how I feel about it."
00:07:18.146,00:07:20.273,"Hey, Pandy, you figured it out."
00:07:20.356,00:07:23.484,Yeah. Who knew my thumby was so yummy?
00:07:25.403,00:07:27.738,"When babies are hungry, they drink milk."
00:07:28.156,00:07:32.618,"And when Baby Blossoms are hungry, they drink milk from one of these."
00:07:32.869,00:07:34.287,Milkweed plants.
00:07:36.831,00:07:38.124,I got this.
00:07:39.083,00:07:42.211,Boom! Itty Bitty Blossom baby bottle.
00:08:11.532,00:08:18.164,"Well, my little cousin always has to be burped after his bottle, or else he gets fussy and cranky."
00:08:18.247,00:08:20.541,So we need to get the burps out of her?
00:08:20.750,00:08:22.585,I think so. Let me try.
00:08:24.086,00:08:28.007,"Come on, little Itty Bitty Blossom. Let's hear those burpies."
00:08:28.090,00:08:30.551,Give me a nice big burp.
00:08:37.016,00:08:38.684,Aww! Poor thing.
00:08:38.768,00:08:40.937,She definitely needs to burp.
00:08:42.522,00:08:44.273,Let's take her to Mama Box.
00:08:44.565,00:08:46.400,I bet she'll know what to do.
00:08:46.484,00:08:48.152,Paw-tastic idea!
00:08:48.861,00:08:49.862,Wait!
00:08:50.363,00:09:00.039,"Don't forget, Baby Blossoms grow from baby to fully grown in one day, so you have to get her back here and planted in the ground before she's fully grown."
00:09:00.623,00:09:04.418,But how will we know when she's fully grown?
00:09:05.002,00:09:08.464,"Well, she'll get too big for her pot and it will start to crack."
00:09:08.548,00:09:12.969,"As soon as you see those cracks, get Itty Bitty Blossom back right away."
00:09:13.302,00:09:16.556,Got it! We'll have this little thing back before she's uh...
00:09:16.847,00:09:19.308,"well, not a little thing anymore."
00:09:20.017,00:09:21.352,"Thanks, Kitty Fairy."
00:09:21.435,00:09:22.436,Good luck!
00:09:48.713,00:09:52.383,-What's wrong with this little one? -This is Itty Bitty Blossom.
00:09:52.466,00:09:55.219,"We fed her, and now she really needs to burp."
00:09:55.428,00:09:57.805,"Oh, poor little plant."
00:09:58.014,00:10:02.184,You need a plant burper to get those little Itty Bitty Blossom burps out.
00:10:02.435,00:10:03.686,A plant burper?
00:10:03.769,00:10:05.229,You have a plant burper?
00:10:05.313,00:10:07.940,"Not yet, but we're gonna build one."
00:10:08.357,00:10:10.568,Let's get crafting!
00:10:29.462,00:10:30.838,Look at those leaves.
00:10:31.172,00:10:33.174,They look like little hands.
00:10:34.133,00:10:37.803,"Well, the best hand to burp a plant is a plant hand."
00:10:45.102,00:10:51.484,"OK. To start the plant burper, we need to turn the crank five times."
00:10:51.692,00:10:53.027,Count with me!
00:10:55.696,00:11:01.952,"two, three, four, five!"
00:11:13.339,00:11:16.342,Ooh. Ah.
00:11:18.052,00:11:21.639,Ooh. Oh. Ooh.
00:11:28.938,00:11:31.357,"Whoa! Gabby, was that you?"
00:11:35.903,00:11:38.030,Excuse you!
00:11:38.322,00:11:39.573,Toodley-doo!
00:11:44.537,00:11:45.830,She's all better.
00:11:59.260,00:12:01.220,Why isn't she smiling and happy?
00:12:01.637,00:12:03.764,There's something pointy on her.
00:12:04.140,00:12:05.141,Ouch!
00:12:06.100,00:12:07.101,Pointy?
00:12:07.935,00:12:08.936,Uh-oh!
00:12:09.019,00:12:11.021,She's sprouting thorns.
00:12:11.647,00:12:14.483,Aww! It's like when babies get their teeth.
00:12:14.567,00:12:15.818,She's uncomfortable.
00:12:18.821,00:12:20.781,I don't know... yet.
00:12:21.198,00:12:25.494,But maybe MerCat has a lotion or potion that will help.
00:12:25.911,00:12:28.164,"Ooh! Great thinking, Gabby!"
00:12:30.207,00:12:32.042,"Thanks for your help, Mama Box."
00:12:43.762,00:12:44.763,MerCat?
00:12:46.807,00:12:47.808,MerCat?
00:12:52.271,00:12:53.814,Gabby. Pandy.
00:12:54.190,00:12:55.900,What's all that crying?
00:12:55.983,00:12:59.737,We need something to soothe this poor little Baby Blossom's thorns.
00:13:00.613,00:13:02.740,Ouch! Poor little plant.
00:13:02.948,00:13:06.660,"Good thing MerCat knows how to take care of that, with just a little..."
00:13:07.453,00:13:09.371,spa science!
00:13:09.455,00:13:12.333,A soothing spritz from a sea sponge should get the job done.
00:13:12.583,00:13:13.792,Paw-tastic!
00:13:14.043,00:13:17.963,-Uh... Where's a sea sponge? -We have to get one out of the water.
00:13:20.591,00:13:24.136,Something green? Something round? Something squishy?
00:13:24.220,00:13:26.388,"Well, it's not quite that easy, Pandy."
00:13:28.265,00:13:32.478,"Sea sponges love to hide in seaweed, so they're very hard to find."
00:13:32.561,00:13:33.646,"Seaweed, huh?"
00:13:34.271,00:13:35.898,That gives me an idea.
00:13:36.273,00:13:41.153,"Hey, MerCat, if sea sponges like seaweed, maybe they'll like..."
00:13:43.364,00:13:44.823,seaweed hair!
00:13:46.158,00:13:50.412,Seaweed hair? They'll definitely want to wiggle in there and hide.
00:13:54.333,00:13:55.960,And it just might work.
00:13:56.168,00:13:58.420,"Pandy, water goggles, please."
00:13:59.088,00:14:00.089,Thanks!
00:14:00.673,00:14:01.966,Here I go!
00:14:09.682,00:14:11.517,Did you find any sea sponges?
00:14:11.600,00:14:13.644,Nope. I didn't see anything.
00:14:25.364,00:14:26.991,Your seaweed hair worked!
00:14:27.074,00:14:29.827,My hair always comes through in a pinch.
00:14:33.163,00:14:34.874,"Here we go, little one."
00:14:41.547,00:14:42.631,It's working!
00:14:52.516,00:14:54.894,Aww! She's all better!
00:14:54.977,00:14:56.186,"Thanks, MerCat."
00:15:00.774,00:15:02.026,"Bye, sea sponge."
00:15:10.409,00:15:12.578,I'm so glad she feels better again.
00:15:17.333,00:15:18.334,Uh-oh.
00:15:29.053,00:15:32.181,Aww! She's a tired little flower.
00:15:32.473,00:15:34.516,"OK. So, take a nap."
00:15:37.895,00:15:39.772,Why isn't she falling asleep?
00:15:39.855,00:15:44.151,"Well, Pandy, sometimes babies need a little help falling asleep."
00:15:44.234,00:15:47.488,I know when I'm sleepy I like to have a song sung to me.
00:15:47.655,00:15:51.742,Ooh! And we know just the groovy little kitty to help us.
00:15:51.951,00:15:53.619,DJ Catnip!
00:15:53.702,00:15:56.080,To the music room!
00:15:59.667,00:16:00.918,I hope it works!
00:16:05.255,00:16:06.465,DJ Catnip!
00:16:09.385,00:16:12.429,Whoa! What's wrong with this little seedling over here?
00:16:12.513,00:16:15.641,This is Itty Bitty Blossom. She needs a nap.
00:16:15.724,00:16:19.144,And a lullaby. Do you have anything for sleepy plants?
00:16:19.228,00:16:20.270,Ooh!
00:16:20.354,00:16:22.856,I've sung a lot of things to sleep before.
00:16:23.065,00:16:27.528,"I'm talking about cats, birds, Pandy Paws..."
00:16:28.153,00:16:30.447,Best nap I've ever had.
00:16:31.073,00:16:33.742,But I'm afraid I don't have a lullaby for a plant.
00:16:33.826,00:16:34.827,"-Oh, no. -Oh."
00:16:34.910,00:16:39.206,So I guess we'll just have to make one up!
00:16:39.289,00:16:40.332,Come on!
00:16:40.416,00:16:41.458,Yeah!
00:16:57.641,00:16:58.976,Can you help us out?
00:16:59.977,00:17:02.479,"Say, Hush, hush, hush."
00:17:33.761,00:17:36.263,"Say, Hush, hush, hush."
00:17:42.936,00:17:44.438,"Great job, singers."
00:17:54.740,00:18:00.329,"Don't forget, Kitty Fairy said she had to be back to the garden before she grows to her full size."
00:18:04.750,00:18:06.293,"Hey, I'll call Carlita."
00:18:09.046,00:18:10.255,"Hey, Catnip."
00:18:10.422,00:18:13.175,"Carlita, we need your power to plant this flower."
00:18:13.759,00:18:15.094,I'll be right there.
00:18:16.929,00:18:17.763,Beep-beep!
00:18:20.307,00:18:21.350,Hop in!
00:18:23.393,00:18:24.812,"To the garden, Carlita!"
00:18:24.895,00:18:26.021,And fast!
00:18:26.105,00:18:28.023,Fast is my favorite word.
00:18:29.733,00:18:31.401,"Anytime, kitty-cats."
00:18:35.781,00:18:37.950,"We have to get her planted, now!"
00:18:42.371,00:18:43.497,"Quick, follow me!"
00:18:50.045,00:18:51.797,I dug a hole right here.
00:19:02.683,00:19:04.017,Wahoo!
00:19:08.438,00:19:12.818,Aww! She's grown to her full size and is safely in her new home.
00:19:12.901,00:19:15.571,"Great job, Gabby! Great job, Pandy!"
00:19:15.654,00:19:18.115,We never would have made it without Carlita.
00:19:18.198,00:19:20.701,Always happy to zoom in with some help.
00:19:23.745,00:19:26.456,"Aww! We love you, too, Itty Bitty Blossom."
00:19:26.540,00:19:29.835,I think we should call her Biggy Blossom now.
00:19:30.127,00:19:32.212,She's not itty-bitty anymore.
00:19:32.379,00:19:34.840,She'll always be a baby in my eyes.
00:19:39.178,00:19:41.889,Thanks for helping us take care of Itty Bitty Blossom.
00:19:42.264,00:19:44.808,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:21:38.839,00:21:40.173,"Come on, let's go!"
00:21:40.424,00:21:42.342,Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!
00:22:11.955,00:22:12.831,"Come on, let's go!"
00:22:29.723,00:22:32.225,Carlita really saved the day today.
00:22:32.476,00:22:35.228,"Hey, check it out. I planted a new seed."
00:22:35.687,00:22:39.024,Come back next time and we'll grow some more adventures.
00:22:39.107,00:22:40.108,Bye!
00:00:47.756,00:00:48.590,Hey.
00:00:48.715,00:00:55.180,"It's my cat Floyd's bedtime, but I can't find his little lovie mouse anywhere, and he can't go to bed without it."
00:00:55.430,00:00:57.974,It's about this big and it's gray.
00:00:58.558,00:01:02.687,Hey! Maybe you can help me look for it. OK. Tell me if you see it.
00:01:03.521,00:01:09.027,"Floyd's lovie mouse is gray, with a little pink heart on the side."
00:01:09.527,00:01:12.238,"OK, let me know when you see him."
00:01:20.080,00:01:22.082,You found it! Thanks!
00:01:24.626,00:01:28.379,"Here you go, Floyd. All ready for night-night."
00:01:28.797,00:01:29.714,Sweet dreams.
00:01:31.674,00:01:35.136,You know what that sound means. It's time for a Dollhouse Delivery!
00:01:35.220,00:01:36.221,Come on.
00:01:45.939,00:01:50.360,"OK, let's open up our Meow Meow Mailbox and see what we have."
00:01:54.572,00:01:56.491,It's a Kitty Fairy Box!
00:01:57.117,00:02:00.703,"I know because of her little wings, and her antenna."
00:02:02.122,00:02:03.248,Should we open it?
00:02:03.873,00:02:04.874,Yeah!
00:02:06.626,00:02:08.378,Ooh!
00:02:08.461,00:02:11.172,I love this crinkly tissue paper.
00:02:12.632,00:02:13.716,Whoa!
00:02:14.092,00:02:15.635,A sleeping bag!
00:02:16.094,00:02:17.095,So cool.
00:02:17.178,00:02:21.432,"Look, you can open it up and close it. And there's these little hearts on it."
00:02:21.891,00:02:23.226,I heart hearts.
00:02:29.107,00:02:30.400,So comfy!
00:02:31.317,00:02:32.402,Ooh!
00:02:33.027,00:02:36.531,And little kitty slippers. They're so adorable!
00:02:36.865,00:02:39.284,And they have a little kitty face on top.
00:02:39.492,00:02:42.328,"And on the bottom, they have the little paw prints."
00:02:42.745,00:02:44.539,Look at those little guys!
00:02:46.499,00:02:49.460,"Hey, these are all things you take to a sleepover."
00:02:55.842,00:02:58.595,Do you want to come to Kitty Fairy's sleepover with me?
00:02:59.304,00:03:01.222,Yeah? Let's go!
00:03:03.016,00:03:04.434,Whoa!
00:03:04.517,00:03:06.519,Check out the Fairy Tail Garden.
00:03:06.603,00:03:10.773,Look at how sparkly and twinkly it is. Let's put our sleepover stuff there.
00:03:15.236,00:03:18.239,Time to get tiny!
00:03:26.122,00:03:27.749,Whee!
00:03:28.082,00:03:29.083,Come on in!
00:03:31.586,00:03:34.088,Welcome to the Fairy Tail Garden.
00:03:34.422,00:03:36.674,Isn't it just beautiful today?
00:03:38.176,00:03:39.594,"Oh, my slippers!"
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.347,Cozy.
00:03:42.764,00:03:45.433,"What do you think, Pandy? Are these cute, or what?"
00:03:46.768,00:03:47.769,Pandy?
00:03:49.062,00:03:50.396,Do you see Pandy?
00:03:54.859,00:03:56.110,I don't see him.
00:03:56.569,00:03:57.737,Hug attack!
00:04:03.034,00:04:04.202,"Hey, Kitty Fairy."
00:04:04.285,00:04:06.329,We're so excited for the sleepover.
00:04:06.412,00:04:09.624,"Me, too. It's gonna be fairy-riffic!"
00:04:09.707,00:04:10.792,I told you.
00:04:12.252,00:04:14.754,"Hey, Gabby. Hey, Pandy."
00:04:17.298,00:04:19.092,"Here you go, Kitty Fairy."
00:04:21.678,00:04:23.429,He's ready to coodle up.
00:04:29.227,00:04:31.312,Are you gonna join us for the sleepover?
00:04:31.896,00:04:33.356,Oh. Um...
00:04:33.690,00:04:36.442,"You know, I'd love to, but..."
00:04:36.943,00:04:41.155,"Pillow Cat, you've just got to stay. We're gonna sleep under the stars!"
00:04:41.239,00:04:44.284,"I... I just can't. Thank you, though."
00:04:45.952,00:04:48.788,Hmm. I wonder why she doesn't want to stay.
00:04:51.666,00:04:54.669,"Hey, Pillow Cat, wait up! Is something wrong?"
00:04:54.919,00:04:57.088,"Well, no. It's just..."
00:04:57.755,00:05:01.509,OK! I've never been to a Kitty Fairy sleepover before.
00:05:01.676,00:05:03.553,I don't know what it's gonna be like.
00:05:03.720,00:05:07.307,"You know what? I've never been to a Kitty Fairy sleepover, either."
00:05:07.390,00:05:08.391,Really?
00:05:08.975,00:05:09.976,Me neither.
00:05:10.601,00:05:12.645,What if we all give it a go together?
00:05:13.813,00:05:15.898,"OK, I'll give it a try."
00:05:16.149,00:05:17.859,I like your cat-titude.
00:05:18.818,00:05:23.364,"OK, everybody, let's get this sleepover party started!"
00:05:23.448,00:05:24.449,Yes!
00:05:24.532,00:05:28.036,First things first. You three need some PJs.
00:05:28.119,00:05:30.663,But I didn't bring any PJs.
00:05:30.747,00:05:32.874,Uh... Neither did we.
00:05:33.082,00:05:35.293,Not a problem. Come this way!
00:05:38.004,00:05:42.925,"When it's PJ time at a Kitty Fairy sleepover, all you need to do is pick some."
00:05:43.968,00:05:47.388,Whoa! Pajamas grow on trees?
00:05:47.680,00:05:50.516,-Yep! -Wait. Do they taste like fruit?
00:05:57.231,00:05:58.858,It never hurts to ask.
00:05:59.609,00:06:03.279,"Just pick out your top and bottom, and I'll take care of the rest."
00:06:12.330,00:06:15.374,"OK, who wants to pick out some PJs?"
00:06:18.628,00:06:19.462,OK.
00:06:22.048,00:06:26.302,Ooh! I like the top with the hearts. You know I love hearts.
00:06:31.933,00:06:33.518,-Paw-some! -Whoa!
00:06:33.601,00:06:36.062,Ooh! So soft.
00:06:36.395,00:06:38.439,Now you just need some bottoms.
00:06:38.606,00:06:39.607,"Oh, right."
00:06:40.983,00:06:46.114,Help me pick out the matching bottoms. Which pajama bottoms match my top?
00:06:49.617,00:06:51.786,The pink hearts! Yes!
00:06:57.542,00:07:01.295,I love my new PJs. Thanks for helping me pick them out.
00:07:01.546,00:07:03.381,Pandy PJ time!
00:07:09.095,00:07:11.556,Hmm. Those rockets are cool.
00:07:12.056,00:07:13.391,Ooh! Trains!
00:07:16.602,00:07:18.396,Those are definitely for me.
00:07:24.235,00:07:26.195,Help me find the matching top.
00:07:28.072,00:07:31.075,Which pajama top has hot dogs and pickles on it?
00:07:35.204,00:07:36.330,Yes!
00:07:39.542,00:07:40.793,Wahoo!
00:07:43.045,00:07:44.380,"Your turn, Pillow Cat."
00:07:51.679,00:07:54.307,Ooh! Stars and moons!
00:07:54.390,00:07:57.351,That reminds me of a blanket I have on my bed.
00:07:57.560,00:07:58.936,That's my pick.
00:08:02.607,00:08:06.152,Ooh! So snuggly!
00:08:08.237,00:08:11.115,Let's find a hat that matches my nightgown.
00:08:11.866,00:08:16.037,Huh. Which hat has stars and moons on it?
00:08:19.457,00:08:21.501,Oh! There it is!
00:08:25.087,00:08:27.798,Ooh! Snuggle-riffic!
00:08:27.882,00:08:31.552,Wow! I've never picked PJs off a tree before.
00:08:32.386,00:08:33.387,Me neither.
00:08:33.638,00:08:34.889,Me double neither.
00:08:47.527,00:08:53.449,"Well, now that we all have our jammies on, it's time for a special Kitty Fairy sleepover snack."
00:08:53.658,00:08:55.159,-Yay! Snacks! -Wahoo!
00:08:55.243,00:08:56.244,Follow me.
00:09:07.547,00:09:09.966,Our special snack is right through this door.
00:09:10.466,00:09:12.510,Hmm. That looks pretty small.
00:09:12.677,00:09:15.763,"But if there's a special snack in there, I'll give it a shot."
00:09:26.941,00:09:28.484,"Uh, Pandy..."
00:09:30.570,00:09:31.696,I'm almost in.
00:09:38.119,00:09:41.414,We just need a little... garden magic!
00:09:48.504,00:09:49.839,Whoa!
00:09:50.006,00:09:51.632,Are you kitten me?
00:09:52.216,00:09:53.801,We're so tiny!
00:09:54.135,00:09:57.305,Sleepovers are full of magical surprises.
00:09:57.597,00:09:59.599,Now we can all fit through the door.
00:10:00.891,00:10:03.894,But how are we gonna get all the way up there?
00:10:04.437,00:10:06.772,"By using your fairy wings, of course."
00:10:10.401,00:10:13.070,This is so dreamy!
00:10:13.988,00:10:15.323,Meow-mazing!
00:10:16.574,00:10:18.701,We have fairy wings!
00:10:25.875,00:10:27.418,I'm flying!
00:10:28.669,00:10:30.212,"Me, too!"
00:10:30.546,00:10:32.006,Whee!
00:10:32.423,00:10:33.966,Wahoo!
00:10:34.216,00:10:35.843,I've always wanted to fly.
00:10:36.010,00:10:40.264,"Pandy, isn't this the most cat-tastic thing ever, or what?"
00:10:40.640,00:10:42.475,Pandy fairy!
00:10:43.267,00:10:44.393,In we go!
00:11:01.327,00:11:02.745,This is awesome!
00:11:05.998,00:11:07.375,Wahoo!
00:11:26.519,00:11:29.730,Welcome to Fizzy Fairy Juice Falls.
00:11:30.439,00:11:31.649,Can we drink it?
00:11:31.732,00:11:32.942,Of course!
00:11:35.653,00:11:36.904,"Hold on, Pandy."
00:11:36.987,00:11:41.075,"To drink Fizzy Fairy Juice, you need a very special fairy cup."
00:11:42.284,00:11:43.786,A flower cup!
00:11:47.873,00:11:49.041,Come on!
00:11:55.589,00:11:58.467,"Now, come on! Let's have a tea party."
00:11:58.592,00:12:00.553,I love tea parties!
00:12:00.803,00:12:01.887,"Me, too."
00:12:01.971,00:12:02.972,Let's do it.
00:12:11.730,00:12:14.150,Mm! Fairy-tastic!
00:12:23.033,00:12:25.870,and fanciest juice I've ever tasted.
00:12:26.078,00:12:28.998,"Yes, yes. Cheers to that."
00:12:32.877,00:12:36.297,I've never drunk anything from a flower before.
00:12:38.883,00:12:39.717,Ah.
00:12:40.050,00:12:41.844,That sure was a funny sip.
00:12:45.431,00:12:47.266,"Now, who's up for a snack?"
00:12:47.349,00:12:48.517,-Yeah! -I am!
00:12:48.601,00:12:50.227,-Wahoo! -Here you go!
00:12:52.730,00:12:54.607,"Uh, Kitty Fairy..."
00:12:56.525,00:12:58.569,there's no popcorn in here.
00:12:58.819,00:12:59.987,There will be.
00:13:03.199,00:13:06.410,Rainbow Fairy popcorn is always best when it's freshly popped.
00:13:06.619,00:13:08.287,Get your boxes ready!
00:13:15.544,00:13:16.587,Popcorn!
00:13:21.300,00:13:23.552,It's raining popcorn!
00:13:34.188,00:13:38.359,"I've had popcorn before, but never like this!"
00:13:43.197,00:13:45.449,"This is amazing, Kitty Fairy!"
00:13:45.658,00:13:46.742,Thank you!
00:13:53.999,00:13:55.000,CatRat!
00:14:01.715,00:14:03.634,You're so big!
00:14:03.842,00:14:06.053,"Uh, I'm just my regular size."
00:14:06.303,00:14:08.305,You guys are all tiny.
00:14:10.307,00:14:15.396,"That's because we're having the best, most magical Kitty Fairy sleepover ever!"
00:14:15.646,00:14:16.647,Mwah!
00:14:17.731,00:14:18.566,CatRat?
00:14:20.234,00:14:23.362,-Would you like some popcorn? -Don't mind if I do.
00:14:29.410,00:14:31.954,"Mm! Mm! Thanks, Kitty Fairy."
00:14:32.246,00:14:34.123,"Bye, tiny friends."
00:14:34.373,00:14:35.791,Toodley-doo!
00:14:36.959,00:14:39.253,"This is amazing, Kitty Fairy!"
00:14:39.420,00:14:40.588,Thank you!
00:14:40.671,00:14:42.673,Are you glad you stayed for the sleepover?
00:14:42.756,00:14:44.758,Glad? Of course!
00:14:44.842,00:14:47.011,Thank you for helping me try something new.
00:14:47.386,00:14:53.684,"I dream about a lot of amazing things, but I've never dreamed a Kitty Fairy sleepover was gonna be like this!"
00:14:53.934,00:14:56.437,-What's next? -Ooh! Let's see.
00:14:58.105,00:14:59.189,PJ tree.
00:14:59.523,00:15:00.524,Fairy wings.
00:15:00.858,00:15:01.859,Fairy snack.
00:15:02.026,00:15:03.903,Ooh! It's Starry Story Time!
00:15:04.361,00:15:07.740,Starry Story Time? That sounds meow-mazing!
00:15:08.365,00:15:10.367,I think you're gonna love it!
00:15:10.784,00:15:15.873,Let's get back to our sleeping spot. It will be faster if we fly. Come on!
00:15:36.018,00:15:40.272,"Wow! Kitty Fairy, that was some garden magic."
00:15:44.693,00:15:49.448,"Now, before we snuggle up for Starry Story Time, we have to brush our teeth."
00:15:49.531,00:15:52.117,Uh-oh! I didn't bring a toothbrush.
00:15:52.493,00:15:57.665,"Pandy, it's a Kitty Fairy sleepover! I have everything you could ever need."
00:16:08.258,00:16:09.426,"Hi, little toothbrush."
00:16:16.225,00:16:17.476,"Bye, toothbrush!"
00:16:19.561,00:16:23.232,Even brushing your teeth is magical at a Kitty Fairy sleepover.
00:16:23.565,00:16:28.112,"OK, everyone, get comfy on your sleeping bags and look up at the stars."
00:16:29.571,00:16:32.700,"-Kitty Fairy, where are the stars? -That's odd."
00:16:34.576,00:16:36.912,It's usually much darker at this time.
00:16:37.830,00:16:41.959,"-Hmm. Let me go check on something. -Ooh! Me, too!"
00:16:48.757,00:16:50.634,That's why it's still bright in here.
00:16:52.094,00:16:54.221,I have an idea to solve this problem.
00:16:54.471,00:16:56.932,You know how Floyd loves this laser light?
00:16:57.141,00:16:59.268,He chases that thing anywhere.
00:16:59.351,00:17:00.352,Exactly!
00:17:00.728,00:17:06.608,"If I point the laser light at the light switch, maybe he'll chase it and turn out the lights for us."
00:17:06.775,00:17:09.570,"Wow! Great thinking, Pandy!"
00:17:13.866,00:17:15.909,"Come on, Floyd. Up. Jump on the desk."
00:17:17.286,00:17:18.495,It's working!
00:17:24.376,00:17:25.711,Yes! Whoo!
00:17:26.003,00:17:27.171,"Thanks, Floyd!"
00:17:27.546,00:17:30.215,"Now, that was cat-tastic."
00:17:30.299,00:17:31.300,Thanks.
00:17:32.051,00:17:34.344,"Come on, let's go look at the stars."
00:17:39.892,00:17:41.268,Whoa!
00:17:41.810,00:17:44.063,Now I can see the stars!
00:17:48.776,00:17:51.612,Now we can have our Starry Story Time.
00:17:51.695,00:17:56.533,"At Starry Story Time, we lie back and look for shapes in the stars."
00:17:56.617,00:18:00.412,"Whatever shapes we find, we use them to tell a story."
00:18:00.913,00:18:04.083,"Pillow Cat, do you see anything in the stars?"
00:18:07.044,00:18:10.422,"a big, squishy pillow planet."
00:18:11.006,00:18:12.591,"What do you see, Gabby?"
00:18:16.220,00:18:17.471,a Pandy!
00:18:19.139,00:18:20.265,And I see a...
00:18:21.683,00:18:23.060,a surfboard!
00:18:25.813,00:18:30.025,Now we can tell our Starry Story about the pictures we see in the sky.
00:18:30.109,00:18:32.319,Stories are my favorite.
00:18:32.486,00:18:34.196,Do you want to tell the story?
00:18:34.613,00:18:35.781,I'd love to!
00:18:36.406,00:18:38.158,Once upon a time...
00:18:40.160,00:18:44.998,Pandy jumped on a surfboard and surfed the stars.
00:18:45.833,00:18:50.546,He surfed over the Big Dipper and under the North Star.
00:18:51.463,00:18:53.882,Pandy surfed until he reached...
00:18:56.885,00:18:57.803,Oh.
00:18:57.886,00:19:04.560,"He was so tired from all that star surfing, he fell fast asleep."
00:19:05.227,00:19:08.230,And he had the most wonderful dream...
00:19:13.318,00:19:15.279,"Great story, Pillow Cat!"
00:19:15.612,00:19:17.990,I wish I really could surf the stars.
00:19:18.323,00:19:21.535,Wait! I see something else in the stars.
00:19:34.840,00:19:38.594,"OK, I don't want this Kitty Fairy sleepover to end."
00:19:38.802,00:19:41.471,I'm so glad I tried something new.
00:19:41.805,00:19:43.265,"Me, too, Pillow Cat."
00:19:46.560,00:19:49.146,Thanks for coming to the Kitty Fairy sleepover.
00:19:49.229,00:19:50.522,Wasn't it special?
00:19:50.731,00:19:52.941,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:08.874,00:20:11.335,"It's me, Pillow Cat!"
00:22:23.967,00:22:25.260,That's how we roll!
00:22:29.806,00:22:32.893,I'm so happy Pillow Cat joined us for the sleepover.
00:22:33.101,00:22:34.394,Wasn't it magical?
00:22:34.853,00:22:38.440,Come back next time and we'll open another Dollhouse Surprise.
00:22:38.523,00:22:39.524,See you soon!
00:00:48.298,00:00:49.174,Hi!
00:00:49.257,00:00:53.136,Pandy and I were just making a new rock for his Good Deed Garden.
00:00:53.219,00:00:54.053,See?
00:00:54.429,00:01:00.226,"Every time Pandy does a good deed, like helping someone or doing something nice, we make a new rock for the garden."
00:01:00.727,00:01:04.355,Like this one. This is when Pandy helped make my bed this morning.
00:01:04.689,00:01:05.690,"Thanks, Pandy."
00:01:06.441,00:01:07.525,Oh!
00:01:07.609,00:01:11.362,And this was the time that Pandy helped MerCat clean up her beach.
00:01:12.530,00:01:13.573,Aww!
00:01:13.656,00:01:17.660,This was the time we babysat the Hamster Kitties.
00:01:21.623,00:01:26.503,"Pandy, you're always looking for ways to help, and that's one of the things I love most about you."
00:01:28.421,00:01:30.048,That's another thing that I love!
00:01:30.131,00:01:33.009,"The Dollhouse Delivery. Come on, let's go see what it is."
00:01:43.478,00:01:44.813,All right.
00:01:44.896,00:01:47.524,Let's see what's in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.
00:01:52.445,00:01:53.822,Look at this!
00:01:54.739,00:01:58.159,Our Kitty Cat Surprise Box looks just like Mama Box.
00:01:58.535,00:02:01.704,She's even in her Kitty Rangers uniform. See?
00:02:02.330,00:02:03.540,That's her sash.
00:02:03.873,00:02:06.501,It's full of patches because she's a Team Leader.
00:02:06.709,00:02:07.919,See how many there are?
00:02:08.294,00:02:09.879,Let's see what's inside.
00:02:14.801,00:02:16.553,A Kitty Ranger sash!
00:02:16.761,00:02:19.097,"And there's one for you, too, Pandy."
00:02:19.597,00:02:20.723,Let's put it on.
00:02:21.474,00:02:23.101,I think it goes this way.
00:02:24.853,00:02:27.313,"All right. Your turn, Pandy."
00:02:28.940,00:02:30.567,OK.
00:02:31.818,00:02:38.116,"Just get your tail through, put it over your Pandy Pack, and there."
00:02:43.872,00:02:46.708,We get to be Kitty Rangers for a day!
00:02:51.087,00:02:52.714,"Hey, that rhymed."
00:02:53.423,00:02:56.968,Do you want to go on a Kitty Ranger adventure in the Dollhouse with us today?
00:02:57.594,00:02:59.304,Great! Let's get going.
00:03:00.179,00:03:01.890,Time to get tiny.
00:03:12.483,00:03:14.903,I'm over here in the craft room. Come on in!
00:03:16.571,00:03:18.865,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:03:18.948,00:03:21.951,I'm so excited to start our Kitty Ranger adventure.
00:03:22.035,00:03:23.202,"What about you, Pandy?"
00:03:24.621,00:03:25.622,Pandy?
00:03:26.205,00:03:27.415,Do you see Pandy?
00:03:28.791,00:03:31.336,Kitty Ranger hug attack!
00:03:32.921,00:03:36.007,"Oh! Hey, Pandy. That was a good one."
00:03:36.090,00:03:37.884,"Hey, Gabby. Hey, Pandy."
00:03:37.967,00:03:39.302,"Hey, Baby Box."
00:03:39.385,00:03:41.512,I like your Kitty Ranger sashes.
00:03:41.596,00:03:45.683,"Hey, everybody. Are you ready for your first Kitty Ranger adventure?"
00:03:45.767,00:03:46.768,We can't wait.
00:03:47.227,00:03:50.480,"Whoa! Mama Box, look at your Kitty Ranger sash."
00:03:50.980,00:03:53.316,It's got so many patches on it!
00:03:53.399,00:03:57.070,"I've been earning these patches for a long, long time."
00:03:57.237,00:03:58.279,You'll get there.
00:03:58.363,00:04:01.658,"We're gonna earn our own patches today, right, Mama?"
00:04:01.741,00:04:03.993,"That's right, my little cardboard cutie."
00:04:10.875,00:04:12.794,All right. I'm ready.
00:04:12.877,00:04:14.462,Bring on the patches.
00:04:14.545,00:04:20.301,"When you're a Kitty Ranger, you earn patches by learning new things… We love learning new things."
00:04:20.385,00:04:21.678,…and by helping.
00:04:21.761,00:04:22.929,We love helping.
00:04:23.012,00:04:25.348,Then you're gonna be great Kitty Rangers.
00:04:25.431,00:04:30.979,"And today, we're gonna learn lots of new things about a little guy who really needs our help."
00:04:33.481,00:04:35.108,Me-hoo?
00:04:36.234,00:04:38.361,It's a little Baby Me-Owl.
00:04:38.861,00:04:39.988,Aww!
00:04:40.196,00:04:41.781,"Hi, little Me-Owl."
00:04:42.865,00:04:44.659,Me-hoo?
00:04:44.742,00:04:46.953,He's so sweet.
00:04:47.745,00:04:50.290,We found him all alone on our windowsill this morning.
00:04:50.373,00:04:52.917,He must have wandered off and lost his Mama Me-Owl.
00:04:53.001,00:04:57.463,We're gonna take him up to the Fairy Tail Garden and help him find his mama.
00:04:57.672,00:05:00.925,"Don't worry, little guy. The Kitty Rangers are here for you."
00:05:01.134,00:05:02.093,Me-hoo?
00:05:02.343,00:05:05.138,Are you ready for your first Kitty Ranger adventure?
00:05:05.221,00:05:07.140,-You bet! -I'm ready.
00:05:07.223,00:05:08.349,"Me, too."
00:05:08.433,00:05:10.143,Me-hoo!
00:05:10.226,00:05:11.519,What are we waiting for?
00:05:11.602,00:05:15.565,Let's get up to the Fairy Tail Garden and start looking for Mama Me-Owl.
00:05:15.648,00:05:17.275,"Whoa! Hold on, Pandy."
00:05:17.358,00:05:22.613,Another thing about Kitty Rangers is Kitty Rangers are always prepared.
00:05:22.697,00:05:29.329,"We're gonna be hiking all through the garden, looking for Mama Me-Owl, so we're gonna need to bring some snacks and water with us."
00:05:29.620,00:05:30.955,Snacks?
00:05:31.039,00:05:33.875,Another reason to love being a Kitty Ranger.
00:05:38.171,00:05:40.590,"Kitty Rangers, to the kitchen!"
00:05:40.840,00:05:42.300,Me-hoo!
00:05:42.383,00:05:44.635,Oh! Hey. Welcome aboard.
00:05:45.053,00:05:47.805,"We're Kitty Rangers, we'll help out others."
00:05:47.889,00:05:50.391,We're gonna find Baby Me-Owl's mother.
00:06:08.743,00:06:10.203,"Hey, Kitty Rangers."
00:06:10.286,00:06:11.954,"-Hi, Cakey. -Me-hoo?"
00:06:14.040,00:06:15.124,Me-hoo?
00:06:15.208,00:06:16.459,Who's this?
00:06:26.385,00:06:31.599,"Yep. And Kitty Rangers are always prepared, so we need to bring some snacks."
00:06:31.682,00:06:33.601,"Do you think you could help us out, Cakey?"
00:06:33.893,00:06:35.853,Sweet sunshine!
00:06:35.937,00:06:37.730,Snacks are my specialty.
00:06:38.064,00:06:41.901,I think some Kitty Ranger Snack Bites would be just the thing.
00:06:42.193,00:06:44.320,Mm-mm! That sounds delicious.
00:06:44.403,00:06:45.571,"Hoo, me-hoo!"
00:06:45.655,00:06:53.454,-How do we make them? -Well… OK.
00:06:53.538,00:07:01.712,"To make Kitty Ranger Snack Bites, we need granola, baby blueberries, and sunflower seeds."
00:07:03.297,00:07:08.886,"And, to stick everything together, sunflower butter."
00:07:09.137,00:07:09.971,Got it!
00:07:12.098,00:07:14.475,OK. Let's get started.
00:07:15.017,00:07:17.937,"First, I'll pour some granola in a bowl."
00:07:20.022,00:07:22.316,Then add in some sunflower butter.
00:07:23.317,00:07:31.325,And then we… Mix the granola with sunflower butter.
00:07:33.494,00:07:35.788,Now everybody gets two scoops.
00:07:40.751,00:07:43.337,"Now, here comes my favorite part."
00:07:43.421,00:07:45.756,"Everybody, roll the Kitty Snack Bites."
00:07:50.636,00:07:52.138,"Look, I made a ball."
00:07:53.139,00:07:53.973,Whoops.
00:07:54.307,00:07:55.641,Just keep rolling.
00:07:55.725,00:07:57.685,"Now, for the finishing touch."
00:07:57.768,00:08:00.855,Some baby blueberries and some sunflower seeds.
00:08:04.567,00:08:06.611,It adds some crunch and some sweetness.
00:08:09.447,00:08:10.990,Let's keep on rolling.
00:08:13.701,00:08:15.369,"Me-hoo, me-hoo!"
00:08:17.955,00:08:19.874,Now let's bag them up for your hike.
00:08:26.172,00:08:30.843,"And the best part is, they're perfect for Baby Me-Owls, too."
00:08:34.263,00:08:36.682,"Yum, yum, yum! Mm!"
00:08:39.227,00:08:40.228,Here you go.
00:08:40.311,00:08:41.437,"Thanks, Cakey."
00:08:41.812,00:08:44.565,"OK, Kitty Rangers. I've got the water."
00:08:45.942,00:08:48.027,We're all prepared for our first hike.
00:08:48.110,00:08:50.905,And guess what? You earned your first patch.
00:08:54.450,00:08:56.035,You got to be kitten me!
00:08:56.118,00:08:58.037,One for Baby Box.
00:08:58.496,00:08:59.330,Thanks!
00:08:59.622,00:09:00.915,One for Gabby.
00:09:01.123,00:09:02.416,Ooh!
00:09:02.500,00:09:04.252,And one for Pandy.
00:09:04.335,00:09:07.797,The Snack Packer Patch is definitely my favorite patch.
00:09:09.257,00:09:12.093,"Pandy, it's your only patch."
00:09:12.176,00:09:14.262,"Yeah, but it's still my favorite."
00:09:17.014,00:09:18.599,Me-hoo!
00:09:18.891,00:09:20.893,"Kitty Rangers, to the garden!"
00:09:42.665,00:09:43.791,"Hey, Kitty Fairy."
00:09:44.458,00:09:45.668,"Hey, Kitty Rangers."
00:09:46.002,00:09:47.128,Me-hoo.
00:09:48.129,00:09:50.214,Aww! Who's this little one?
00:09:50.298,00:09:54.051,That's Baby Me-Owl. He's lost and we're looking for his mama.
00:09:54.135,00:09:58.681,"Well, I know the Me-Owls live way on the other side of the Fairy Tail Stream."
00:10:01.559,00:10:05.146,"If you follow that path, it will take you there."
00:10:08.691,00:10:09.900,"Thanks, Kitty Fairy."
00:10:09.984,00:10:10.985,Good luck!
00:10:30.296,00:10:32.340,"Hey, look! Animal tracks."
00:10:34.800,00:10:35.676,Hmm.
00:10:36.135,00:10:41.349,"It looks like there are three different kinds of tracks, and each one goes down a different path."
00:10:42.391,00:10:45.227,I bet one of these tracks are Mama Me-Owl's.
00:10:45.311,00:10:50.191,Maybe we can use our Kitty Ranger skills to figure out which footprints are Mama Me-Owl's.
00:10:50.274,00:10:52.151,Then we'll know what path to take.
00:10:52.526,00:10:54.362,"I like your thinking, Gabby."
00:10:54.695,00:10:57.448,"What does her footprint look like, Mama?"
00:10:57.531,00:11:00.826,"Well, it looks just like Baby Me-Owl's."
00:11:01.827,00:11:02.912,Me-hoo?
00:11:03.371,00:11:04.372,Baby Me-Owl?
00:11:05.331,00:11:06.791,-May I? -Me-hoo.
00:11:07.208,00:11:12.922,"So, the footprint we're looking for has a circle with three rectangle toes."
00:11:16.092,00:11:17.134,Mm!
00:11:17.218,00:11:20.304,"Pandy, are you hungry already?"
00:11:20.388,00:11:24.266,Maybe just one little Kitty Trail Snacky from my Packy.
00:11:27.645,00:11:31.690,"All right, Kitty Rangers, time to practice your tracking skills."
00:11:32.108,00:11:36.737,Remember what track we're looking for. A circle with three rectangle toes.
00:11:36.821,00:11:38.406,Let's look at the first track.
00:11:40.741,00:11:44.578,Does this track have a circle with three rectangle toes?
00:11:46.372,00:11:50.334,Nope. This one's a triangle with three rectangle toes.
00:11:50.918,00:11:52.586,I'll check the next track.
00:11:53.921,00:11:57.091,Does this one have a circle with three long rectangle toes?
00:11:59.844,00:12:01.429,Hmm. Nope.
00:12:01.512,00:12:05.641,"That's a circle, but the toes are square, not rectangle."
00:12:05.850,00:12:07.935,That's not Mama Me-Owl's print.
00:12:08.018,00:12:11.605,"Come on, Baby Me-Owl. Let's check the next one."
00:12:13.649,00:12:17.153,Does this one have a circle with three rectangle toes?
00:12:19.280,00:12:20.406,Yes!
00:12:21.157,00:12:23.033,That's your mama's footprint.
00:12:23.117,00:12:25.369,Me-hoo! Mama!
00:12:25.453,00:12:29.290,"Way to go, Kitty Rangers! Now we know which path to take."
00:12:29.373,00:12:31.542,And you've earned another patch.
00:12:31.625,00:12:33.919,Your Tracking Patch.
00:12:36.338,00:12:37.423,"Thanks, Mama!"
00:12:37.506,00:12:41.010,You learned about Me-Owl prints and how to be great trackers.
00:12:41.218,00:12:42.845,Me-hoo!
00:12:42.928,00:12:44.221,"Here you go, Gabby."
00:12:47.850,00:12:50.728,"Now, let's follow the tracks and find that mama."
00:12:50.811,00:12:52.480,Me-hoo!
00:13:11.499,00:13:13.584,Uh-oh. The path ends here.
00:13:14.084,00:13:18.047,But look! The path starts again on the other side of the stream.
00:13:18.631,00:13:22.134,Hmm. Sounds like we need to figure out a way to cross this stream.
00:13:22.218,00:13:23.928,"What do you think, Kitty Rangers?"
00:13:26.680,00:13:28.849,"That's a great idea, Baby Box."
00:13:29.350,00:13:33.145,"OK, let's all look around and see what we can find to build with."
00:13:33.562,00:13:34.939,Me-hoo!
00:13:36.398,00:13:41.195,Ooh! Maybe we could pile up a bunch of leaves in the water and walk across them.
00:13:46.325,00:13:49.411,maybe we could step on them to get to the other side.
00:13:50.788,00:13:51.830,Sticks.
00:13:54.083,00:13:58.170,"Hey, maybe we can lay these sticks over the water and walk across the stream."
00:13:59.129,00:14:00.214,What did you find?
00:14:00.297,00:14:01.882,I've got leaves.
00:14:02.216,00:14:03.467,I've got rocks.
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.096,All right.
00:14:07.179,00:14:09.515,Let's give it the Kitty Ranger try.
00:14:14.311,00:14:16.146,They're floating away.
00:14:16.397,00:14:19.108,Looks like we're not getting across on leaves.
00:14:19.608,00:14:23.112,"Good try, Baby Box. Let's see if these rocks work."
00:14:29.285,00:14:32.079,"Oh, no! They all sunk!"
00:14:32.246,00:14:36.125,Oops! I guess the water's too deep to walk across on the rocks.
00:14:36.417,00:14:37.793,Maybe sticks will work.
00:14:41.338,00:14:43.507,"Nope. Sticks don't work, either."
00:14:43.591,00:14:45.050,"Try another one, Pandy."
00:14:45.134,00:14:47.303,"Yeah, try a longer one."
00:14:54.101,00:14:57.354,"The longer sticks reach! Everybody, grab a long stick."
00:14:57.438,00:14:58.814,Me-hoo!
00:15:00.232,00:15:02.234,Excuse me. Coming through.
00:15:02.693,00:15:03.736,I've got one.
00:15:06.155,00:15:07.406,It's working!
00:15:07.656,00:15:09.700,One more. And there.
00:15:10.492,00:15:11.702,We built a bridge!
00:15:11.785,00:15:14.204,Me-hoo! Me-hoo! Me-hoo! Me-hoo!
00:15:14.288,00:15:15.164,Yeah.
00:15:15.247,00:15:20.836,"We had a few floaters and some sinkers, but we didn't give up until we found what worked."
00:15:21.045,00:15:25.257,"You made it work, and you earned your Kitty Rangers Builder's Patch."
00:15:25.507,00:15:26.508,Yes!
00:15:27.009,00:15:30.304,"That was amazing teamwork, Kitty Rangers."
00:15:30.471,00:15:31.597,Whoa!
00:15:36.185,00:15:41.023,"OK, Kitty Rangers, let's cross our new bridge and keep looking for Mama Me-Owl."
00:16:01.752,00:16:02.878,This way!
00:16:05.089,00:16:06.632,Hmm.
00:16:06.715,00:16:09.593,"Look, Mama. The path splits again."
00:16:09.677,00:16:11.929,How do we know which path to take now?
00:16:12.012,00:16:13.389,Me-hoo.
00:16:13.597,00:16:17.726,Hmm. Mama Me-Owl must have flown down one of these paths.
00:16:17.893,00:16:19.269,Me-hoo.
00:16:19.979,00:16:23.482,"Don't worry, Baby Me-Owl. We're gonna figure out which way your mama went."
00:16:23.565,00:16:26.777,Yeah. No one gives up on Baby Me-Owl.
00:16:27.152,00:16:28.612,"I've got you, buddy."
00:16:28.696,00:16:30.489,Me-hoo.
00:16:32.533,00:16:36.120,"So, how do we know which path to take if there aren't any footprints?"
00:16:36.954,00:16:40.457,Maybe we can listen for Mama Me-Owl's me-hoo.
00:16:40.624,00:16:43.210,"Me-hoo, me-hoo! Me-hoo, me-hoo!"
00:16:43.919,00:16:44.962,Let's take a listen.
00:16:50.551,00:16:52.553,No. That sounds like a duck.
00:16:52.636,00:16:54.847,"OK, not down that path."
00:16:55.139,00:16:56.557,Let's try the next one.
00:16:57.975,00:16:59.935,Is Mama Me-Owl down this path?
00:17:02.438,00:17:04.773,Does that sound like Mama Me-Owl?
00:17:05.899,00:17:07.776,Nope. That's a rooster.
00:17:09.737,00:17:14.033,Keep your kitty ears open down this path for Mama Me-Owl's me-hoo.
00:17:14.908,00:17:17.703,Me-hoo! Me-hoo!
00:17:18.120,00:17:19.329,Did you hear that?
00:17:19.955,00:17:21.498,Me-hoo!
00:17:22.207,00:17:24.251,Does that sound like Mama Me-Owl?
00:17:25.419,00:17:27.921,Yes! This is the right path.
00:17:28.005,00:17:29.882,"Great listening, Kitty Rangers."
00:17:30.758,00:17:31.967,We did it!
00:17:34.428,00:17:36.472,"Me-hoo, me-hoo, me-hoo!"
00:17:36.555,00:17:42.770,"All right, Kitty Rangers, you've made your Ranger Leader proud, and you've earned another patch."
00:17:43.062,00:17:44.605,Your Listening Patch.
00:17:45.606,00:17:46.940,Paw-tastic!
00:17:52.488,00:17:53.864,"Here you go, Gabby."
00:17:54.406,00:17:55.407,Thanks.
00:17:55.616,00:17:57.117,Let's go find your mama.
00:17:57.201,00:17:58.535,Me-hoo!
00:18:12.341,00:18:13.217,This is it!
00:18:13.842,00:18:16.011,These are the Owl-Wood Trees.
00:18:16.553,00:18:19.765,Mama Me-Owl must be in one of those trees.
00:18:20.015,00:18:21.183,Me-hoo! Me-hoo!
00:18:21.433,00:18:25.062,"OK, Baby Me-Owl. We need to tell your mama you're home."
00:18:25.145,00:18:27.481,Do you have a special call you use for her?
00:18:27.815,00:18:28.732,Me-hoo!
00:18:36.824,00:18:38.992,Wow! That is quite the call.
00:18:39.326,00:18:42.162,Could you teach it to us so we can all call her together?
00:18:42.371,00:18:43.455,Me-hoo!
00:18:43.664,00:18:45.582,Sing the Me-Owl call with us.
00:19:00.013,00:19:02.307,Me-hoo? Me-hoo?
00:19:04.101,00:19:05.686,Me-hoo!
00:19:06.019,00:19:07.855,Me-hoo! Me-hoo!
00:19:07.938,00:19:09.565,"Me-hoo! Me-hoo, Mama!"
00:19:09.648,00:19:12.568,"I'm so glad you're back with your mama, Baby Me-Owl."
00:19:12.651,00:19:15.654,I wouldn't ever want to be away from my mama.
00:19:17.197,00:19:19.616,"Me-hoo, me-hoo, me-hoo."
00:19:19.700,00:19:22.286,"Oh, you're welcome, Mama Me-Owl."
00:19:23.328,00:19:25.497,"-You know what? -What, Mama?"
00:19:25.581,00:19:28.667,You guys are the best Kitty Rangers I've ever met.
00:19:28.750,00:19:31.378,You should all be very proud of yourselves today.
00:19:31.461,00:19:35.174,And I've got one last special patch for your sashes.
00:19:35.257,00:19:38.010,Your Me-Owl Rescue Patch!
00:19:38.093,00:19:39.970,Kitty Ranger Baby Box.
00:19:43.974,00:19:45.767,And Kitty Ranger Gabby.
00:19:49.354,00:19:50.772,Me-hoo!
00:19:51.356,00:19:54.526,Wow! We filled up our whole sash with patches.
00:19:54.818,00:19:55.861,We did it!
00:19:55.944,00:19:58.447,-Who's up for a Kitty Snack Bite? -Me-hoo-hoo!
00:19:59.156,00:20:00.949,-Mm! -Me-hoo!
00:20:01.033,00:20:02.242,Aww!
00:20:02.534,00:20:03.660,Me-hoo-hoo!
00:20:03.744,00:20:05.746,-Mm! Delicious. -I want one!
00:20:06.121,00:20:09.625,Wow! That was an amazing Kitty Ranger adventure.
00:20:09.708,00:20:11.793,I'm so glad you came along.
00:20:11.877,00:20:13.795,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:29.269,00:20:31.355,"It's me, Gabby!"
00:20:32.814,00:20:34.066,"Hey, Gabby Cats."
00:20:35.525,00:20:38.487,Are you ready to sing one of my favorite songs?
00:20:39.696,00:20:40.906,Then let's do it!
00:21:53.603,00:21:54.688,"Hey, Gabby Cats."
00:21:56.148,00:21:57.024,"Yes, you will."
00:21:58.358,00:21:59.443,Let's do this!
00:22:16.585,00:22:19.671,I really loved being a Kitty Ranger with you today.
00:22:19.963,00:22:22.424,And check out all the cool patches we earned.
00:22:22.507,00:22:26.094,"I think, out of all of them, my favorite is the Me-Owl Rescue Patch."
00:22:32.768,00:22:34.102,"Isn't that right, Pandy?"
00:22:36.188,00:22:40.317,Come back next time and we'll open up another Dollhouse Surprise. Bye!
00:00:47.505,00:00:48.506,"Oh, hey!"
00:00:48.840,00:00:51.634,Pandy and I are making a movie on my phone!
00:00:51.843,00:00:54.471,I'm the director. That means I tell the story.
00:00:58.683,00:01:01.436,Our story begins at the beach.
00:01:01.686,00:01:14.032,"On a beautiful, sunny day, Pandy was making a sandcastle, when, all of a sudden… …a giant octopus appeared!"
00:01:14.115,00:01:15.158,Wah!
00:01:15.408,00:01:21.039,The giant octopus trapped Pandy with his long octopus arms.
00:01:23.792,00:01:29.964,But there was only one hero brave enough to save Pandy from the clutches of the giant octopus.
00:01:30.048,00:01:37.555,And that hero was… …Hero Floyd!
00:01:40.350,00:01:46.773,"Hero Floyd sent the angry octopus back to the sea, and Pandy was saved."
00:01:49.317,00:01:51.569,They all lived happily ever after.
00:01:51.861,00:01:53.655,"The end. Nice work, everybody!"
00:01:55.532,00:01:58.493,"Hey, did you hear that? It was the Dollhouse Delivery!"
00:01:58.576,00:02:00.245,"Come on, let's go see what it is."
00:02:10.839,00:02:15.510,"OK, Meow Meow Mailbox, what have you got for us today? Let's see."
00:02:19.389,00:02:20.640,Check this out.
00:02:20.974,00:02:25.645,"Our cat box is gold and has all these cool stars on it, too."
00:02:26.271,00:02:28.231,"And look, there's a movie camera."
00:02:28.565,00:02:30.358,I wonder what this means.
00:02:30.608,00:02:31.609,Let's see.
00:02:32.068,00:02:33.361,OK.
00:02:34.404,00:02:40.910,It's a tiny box of popcorn and two itty-bitty movie tickets.
00:02:43.788,00:02:45.874,It's movie night in the Dollhouse!
00:02:46.207,00:02:48.168,"Hey, do you want to come with us?"
00:02:49.085,00:02:50.170,Great!
00:02:50.461,00:02:55.216,"Now, what I'm gonna do is put these movie tickets and popcorn in my bag."
00:03:08.771,00:03:10.315,Whee!
00:03:11.065,00:03:13.276,I'm over here in the bedroom. Come on in!
00:03:14.611,00:03:17.113,Pillow Cat's going to be so excited.
00:03:17.196,00:03:18.281,"Right, Pandy?"
00:03:18.823,00:03:21.576,Ooh. Where is that Pandy Paws?
00:03:24.495,00:03:25.330,Pandy?
00:03:25.955,00:03:26.998,I don't see him.
00:03:28.041,00:03:29.000,Hug attack!
00:03:30.919,00:03:33.588,"Hi, guys. What's going on?"
00:03:35.423,00:03:36.549,"Hey, Pillow Cat."
00:03:41.721,00:03:45.892,No one gets excited until the director tells them to.
00:03:46.142,00:03:47.143,The director?
00:03:47.227,00:03:48.228,That's right.
00:03:48.311,00:03:52.857,Today we're not just watching a movie… we're making a movie.
00:03:54.108,00:03:55.318,Ha-cha!
00:03:55.401,00:03:57.362,And I'm the director.
00:04:01.032,00:04:03.618,That means I tell everyone what to do.
00:04:06.663,00:04:08.623,And… action!
00:04:11.125,00:04:14.504,"Uh, action means you should start doing stuff."
00:04:19.759,00:04:21.010,Oh.
00:04:21.261,00:04:23.930,"Yeah, I… I forgot about that part."
00:04:24.013,00:04:25.890,I know a great story.
00:04:28.226,00:04:30.603,Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
00:04:30.687,00:04:31.688,What's it about?
00:04:31.771,00:04:37.694,"In a forest, a young girl named Goldilocks is hungry and tired."
00:04:40.238,00:04:42.115,"Oh, I remember that story."
00:04:42.198,00:04:45.785,"Goldilocks gets to the Three Bears' house, but they're out for a walk."
00:04:45.952,00:04:46.911,I love it!
00:04:46.995,00:04:50.206,That's our movie. And… action!
00:04:50.456,00:04:58.172,"Uh, CatRat… There's still a lot to do before we can start making a movie."
00:04:58.256,00:04:59.299,Like what?
00:04:59.382,00:05:03.845,"Well, we need to figure out who's going to play Goldilocks and the Three Bears."
00:05:04.095,00:05:06.973,Yeah. Who's going to be Goldilocks?
00:05:09.684,00:05:12.353,"Gabby, you'd be a great Goldilocks!"
00:05:17.942,00:05:20.945,"Pillow Cat, I think you'd be a great Mama Bear."
00:05:21.029,00:05:22.405,Don't mind if I do!
00:05:22.488,00:05:24.240,Let me go get my costume.
00:05:28.911,00:05:31.497,"Hi, Dress-Up Closet. Can I come in?"
00:05:33.541,00:05:34.542,Thank you.
00:05:37.295,00:05:39.589,I'm ready for my close-up.
00:05:39.797,00:05:41.883,Ooh! Ooh! Can I play Baby Bear?
00:05:47.680,00:05:50.850,"Come on, do I make a cute Baby Bear, or what?"
00:05:52.643,00:05:54.270,Who's gonna play Papa Bear?
00:05:54.353,00:05:57.482,"I can't, because I'm… the director."
00:05:58.441,00:05:59.901,I have an idea.
00:06:00.193,00:06:01.569,Let's call DJ Catnip.
00:06:08.451,00:06:09.744,"Hey, DJ Catnip."
00:06:09.827,00:06:11.996,"Oh, hey! What's up, kitty cats?"
00:06:12.246,00:06:16.918,"We're making a movie about Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and we need you to play Papa Bear."
00:06:18.961,00:06:20.004,Be right there.
00:06:22.632,00:06:24.926,"DJ Catnip, at your service."
00:06:25.134,00:06:26.135,Yay!
00:06:26.594,00:06:30.848,"Oh, DJ, you're gonna make a cat-tastic Papa Bear."
00:06:34.769,00:06:35.770,Here I go!
00:06:38.272,00:06:40.858,Papa Bear in the house.
00:06:40.942,00:06:42.276,Wahoo!
00:06:48.616,00:06:52.203,"Alright, are we finally ready to make this thing?"
00:06:52.286,00:06:53.788,"Well, let's see."
00:06:54.122,00:06:58.084,"The first place Goldilocks goes is the kitchen, to eat some porridge."
00:06:58.584,00:06:59.961,"Oh, I know!"
00:07:00.253,00:07:03.089,Baby Box and the Box Cats are super crafty.
00:07:03.881,00:07:06.592,I bet they could make a pretend kitchen set for us.
00:07:06.676,00:07:09.178,"We're gonna need a pretend bedroom set, too."
00:07:09.262,00:07:13.224,And we need a room with lots of space to fit all our pretend movie stuff.
00:07:13.474,00:07:15.393,How about the playroom?
00:07:15.476,00:07:21.691,"It's super big, and if we're gonna play pretend, why not do it in the playroom?"
00:07:22.275,00:07:24.986,"Alright, everyone in the Cat-A-Vator."
00:07:26.946,00:07:31.367,"Catnip and I will go talk to Baby Box, and you guys go get some porridge from Cakey."
00:07:34.370,00:07:35.455,Going up!
00:07:39.584,00:07:42.253,"Hey, Baby Box, we need your help with our movie."
00:07:51.179,00:07:52.013,"Hey, Cakey."
00:07:52.096,00:07:53.181,"Hey, Gabby."
00:07:53.264,00:07:54.932,"Hey, everyone. What's up?"
00:07:57.143,00:07:59.437,We're making a movie and we need your help.
00:07:59.520,00:08:05.485,"Yeah, we need to make three bowls of porridge - one small, one medium, and one large."
00:08:05.943,00:08:07.487,I've got the bowls.
00:08:08.946,00:08:12.658,"Small, medium, and large."
00:08:13.117,00:08:15.578,Great! Now we need some porridge to eat.
00:08:15.870,00:08:18.748,"Well, I don't have any porridge."
00:08:19.707,00:08:21.709,Maybe you could use some yummy pancakes.
00:08:21.792,00:08:23.294,I love pancakes.
00:08:23.377,00:08:24.420,OK.
00:08:25.463,00:08:27.673,"One small pancake, coming up."
00:08:30.426,00:08:33.054,"Medium pancake, coming at you."
00:08:34.222,00:08:36.766,And your large pancake.
00:08:39.477,00:08:40.811,Pancakes in a bowl?
00:08:44.232,00:08:45.274,I can do that.
00:08:45.358,00:08:48.736,OK. Let's get these up to the playroom and meet CatRat.
00:08:49.070,00:08:50.071,"Thanks, Cakey!"
00:08:50.154,00:08:51.822,Always happy to help.
00:09:08.381,00:09:11.092,"-Perfect. -Hey, Baby Box. Hey, Carlita."
00:09:11.175,00:09:12.176,"Hey, guys."
00:09:12.385,00:09:14.929,Cat-tastic! Everyone's here.
00:09:15.012,00:09:16.889,We've got the bowls and pancakes.
00:09:17.098,00:09:19.684,What do you think of the Kitty Bears' kitchen?
00:09:19.892,00:09:20.977,Whoa!
00:09:22.728,00:09:24.397,It looks paw-esome!
00:09:24.480,00:09:25.940,Need anything else?
00:09:26.148,00:09:29.277,"Pillow Cat, where do we go after the kitchen in the story?"
00:09:30.194,00:09:31.195,The bedroom!
00:09:31.445,00:09:35.074,"Baby Box, can you build us a pretend bedroom, too?"
00:09:35.157,00:09:36.867,No problem.
00:09:40.913,00:09:42.456,We'll be back. Beep-beep!
00:09:42.540,00:09:44.417,And don't forget the three beds!
00:09:44.959,00:09:45.960,On it!
00:09:46.794,00:09:48.504,"OK, OK. I got it."
00:09:48.588,00:09:53.259,"So, Gabby-locks, in this scene, you're really tired and hungry."
00:09:53.509,00:09:54.510,OK.
00:09:55.678,00:09:57.597,And… action!
00:09:59.724,00:10:02.602,Ugh! I'm so tired.
00:10:03.769,00:10:05.771,And so hungry.
00:10:06.856,00:10:08.357,Hmm. More tired.
00:10:13.821,00:10:15.740,You're so hungry.
00:10:20.620,00:10:26.250,I just need to sit down and have a little bit of this delicious-looking porridge.
00:10:30.838,00:10:31.881,"Thanks, Pandy."
00:10:34.133,00:10:40.222,I just need to sit down and have a little bit of this delicious-looking pancake.
00:10:42.475,00:10:45.561,Ooh. This chair is too hard.
00:10:47.188,00:10:48.022,Oop!
00:10:53.361,00:10:55.696,This pancake is too hot!
00:10:57.531,00:10:59.325,Let's see about this chair.
00:11:01.369,00:11:04.497,This chair is too soft.
00:11:07.166,00:11:09.251,And the pancake's too cold.
00:11:10.252,00:11:11.671,Let me try this chair.
00:11:15.800,00:11:19.553,This chair's not too hard and it's not too soft.
00:11:19.637,00:11:22.348,This chair is just right.
00:11:23.557,00:11:24.850,Mm-mmm!
00:11:25.142,00:11:28.646,"This pancake is just right, too."
00:11:33.526,00:11:34.860,Whoa!
00:11:35.319,00:11:36.195,Cut!
00:11:36.278,00:11:37.988,-We made a movie! -That was amazing!
00:11:38.072,00:11:38.906,Great job!
00:11:38.989,00:11:41.409,That was pretty funny when the chair broke.
00:11:41.492,00:11:44.995,"OK, the next part takes place in the bedroom."
00:11:45.079,00:11:46.789,Where's my bedroom set?
00:11:47.373,00:11:48.207,Beep-beep!
00:11:53.921,00:11:55.214,One bedroom set.
00:11:55.589,00:11:57.967,But where's Baby Box with the beds?
00:11:59.176,00:12:06.100,I got your big bread… your medium bread… and your teeny-tiny bread.
00:12:11.021,00:12:12.481,"Oh, snippets!"
00:12:12.690,00:12:14.400,"It's OK, Baby Box."
00:12:14.483,00:12:17.027,I'm sure we can figure out some solution.
00:12:17.111,00:12:18.154,Let's think.
00:12:22.992,00:12:25.119,These can be bread beds.
00:12:25.202,00:12:28.456,Bread beds? Nobody sleeps on bread beds.
00:12:28.539,00:12:29.748,But maybe they'll work.
00:12:29.832,00:12:32.960,How will we know unless we give the bread beds a try?
00:12:33.043,00:12:35.212,"Bread bed, bread bed, bread bed, bread bed."
00:12:35.588,00:12:36.797,That's fun to say.
00:12:36.881,00:12:39.842,Let's say bread bed as fast as we can.
00:12:45.264,00:12:46.682,"Alright, alright."
00:12:46.765,00:12:48.934,I guess we're going with bread beds.
00:12:54.231,00:12:56.358,And… action!
00:12:57.318,00:13:00.863,Ooh! Look at these comfy-looking bread beds.
00:13:01.906,00:13:03.616,Let's try this tiny one.
00:13:05.993,00:13:08.871,This bread bed is definitely too small.
00:13:08.954,00:13:10.372,Let's try the next one.
00:13:12.917,00:13:16.420,Ugh. This bread bed's not very comfortable.
00:13:17.421,00:13:19.215,Let me try the big bread bed.
00:13:22.301,00:13:25.304,This bread bed is just right.
00:13:25.387,00:13:27.473,It's so comfy.
00:13:27.723,00:13:39.401,I think I might just… Brilliant!
00:13:41.529,00:13:43.697,"OK, what do you need me to cut?"
00:13:44.323,00:13:48.827,"Psst! Baby Box, when you're making a movie, cut just means stop."
00:13:51.622,00:13:54.542,"Well, I'm here if you need me."
00:13:56.001,00:13:58.796,"OK, I need the Three Kitty Bears."
00:13:59.547,00:14:01.674,-Right here! -Ready to go!
00:14:01.757,00:14:03.592,This is where you guys come home.
00:14:03.676,00:14:06.095,"Hang on, let me get my Papa Bear on."
00:14:11.559,00:14:13.477,And… action!
00:14:15.020,00:14:18.232,"Ah, home sweet home."
00:14:18.315,00:14:19.817,I sure am hungry.
00:14:19.900,00:14:23.696,"Yeah, my little-bitty Baby Bear tummy sure is hungry, too."
00:14:24.154,00:14:29.618,"Well, it's a good thing I made my special Papa Bear Pancakes."
00:14:29.702,00:14:30.911,Ooh! Yummy!
00:14:32.329,00:14:35.624,"Hey, somebody's been eating my pancake."
00:14:40.170,00:14:44.049,"Somebody's been eating my pancake, and they ate the whole thing!"
00:14:44.466,00:14:46.510,And then they broke my chair!
00:14:47.511,00:14:49.346,Let's go check the bedroom.
00:14:53.475,00:14:55.769,Somebody's been sleeping in my bread bed.
00:14:59.481,00:15:03.068,"And someone's been sleeping in my bread bed, too."
00:15:04.236,00:15:08.741,"And somebody's been sleeping in my bread bed, and they're still here!"
00:15:15.247,00:15:19.919,"Oh! Hi, guys. I got here a little early, so I just made myself at home."
00:15:20.002,00:15:21.503,"Yeah, yeah, sure."
00:15:21.587,00:15:24.173,Made yourself at home with my pancake.
00:15:24.256,00:15:25.799,You ate the whole thing!
00:15:25.883,00:15:29.511,"I'm so sorry, Pandy… I-I mean, Baby Kitty Bear."
00:15:29.887,00:15:32.640,"Well, I brought that bottle of honey you asked me for."
00:15:32.723,00:15:33.849,"Great, Gabby."
00:15:33.933,00:15:35.976,Or should I say Gabby-locks?
00:15:36.060,00:15:40.814,"Now I can make my special Papa Bear Syrup, who's up for some pancakes?"
00:15:40.898,00:15:41.732,Me!
00:15:46.153,00:15:47.571,That's a wrap!
00:15:48.405,00:15:49.615,-Great! -We did it!
00:15:49.823,00:15:51.116,Yeah!
00:15:51.200,00:15:52.576,Let's go watch the movie!
00:15:52.660,00:15:53.702,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:15:53.786,00:15:56.413,You can't have a great movie without great music.
00:15:56.497,00:15:58.123,"Oh, yeah, that's true."
00:15:58.749,00:16:01.043,To the Kitty-Ditty Machine!
00:16:17.768,00:16:21.313,We're gonna watch some parts of the movie and then add music to them.
00:16:21.480,00:16:23.023,And we're gonna need your help.
00:16:23.107,00:16:27.152,"OK, we need to add some music that's good to fall asleep to."
00:16:32.032,00:16:34.493,Is this good music to fall asleep to?
00:16:37.371,00:16:39.999,Nuh-uh. That's dancing music.
00:16:40.082,00:16:43.585,OK. Is this music you can fall asleep to?
00:16:52.594,00:16:55.222,"Yeah, that music was perfect!"
00:16:55.305,00:16:56.223,It is.
00:16:59.143,00:17:02.146,What? Was I catnapping again?
00:17:04.857,00:17:09.737,"Next, for this moment where Gabby broke the chair… Whoa!"
00:17:09.820,00:17:12.531,…we need to add the sound of a chair breaking.
00:17:13.991,00:17:16.285,Does this sound like a chair breaking?
00:17:21.290,00:17:23.417,Was that the right sound to use?
00:17:24.418,00:17:26.420,-That was a cow. -A cow!
00:17:26.503,00:17:27.504,Moo!
00:17:30.883,00:17:32.342,How about this sound?
00:17:32.426,00:17:34.636,Is this the sound of a chair breaking?
00:17:39.725,00:17:41.977,Nope. That was a party horn.
00:17:43.437,00:17:45.731,Is this the sound of a chair breaking?
00:17:50.903,00:17:52.571,"Yes, that's it!"
00:17:52.654,00:17:53.989,Thanks for your help.
00:17:54.281,00:17:55.866,"-Alright! -Did you see that, DJ?"
00:17:55.949,00:17:57.034,-Awesome! -Yeah!
00:17:57.117,00:18:00.245,"-Great job, everybody! -Calling all movie-helper Gabby Cats."
00:18:00.329,00:18:03.540,Boogie on down to the music room for movie night.
00:18:03.624,00:18:05.167,Is there room for little Cakey?
00:18:05.250,00:18:06.376,-Yeah! -Yay!
00:18:06.460,00:18:07.711,-Movie night! -We're here!
00:18:07.795,00:18:09.421,-This is gonna be exciting! -Yay!
00:18:09.505,00:18:11.131,I can't wait to watch it!
00:18:11.215,00:18:12.549,Me neither.
00:18:12.633,00:18:16.386,I had such a cat-tastic time playing Gabby-locks today.
00:18:16.470,00:18:17.805,-Good idea. -Yeah.
00:18:17.888,00:18:22.518,"My composer and I, DJ Catnip, are gonna go put some finishing touches on the movie."
00:18:22.601,00:18:25.562,"Pandy, do you mind collecting everyone's tickets?"
00:18:25.646,00:18:26.563,Sure!
00:18:28.941,00:18:29.942,Thank you.
00:18:30.109,00:18:32.069,"Tickets, please! Thank you."
00:18:32.903,00:18:34.488,"Your ticket, madame?"
00:18:38.909,00:18:40.327,"Why, thank you."
00:18:42.579,00:18:45.040,"Alright, we're ready for the movie."
00:18:45.290,00:18:47.751,"Oh, wait! Gabby, the popcorn!"
00:18:47.835,00:18:48.836,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:48.961,00:18:51.547,Who wants popcorn?
00:18:51.964,00:18:53.590,Yay!
00:18:53.674,00:18:54.758,Yeah!
00:18:54.967,00:18:55.968,Yum!
00:18:56.051,00:18:58.095,Wahoo! Yay!
00:18:58.512,00:19:02.182,"Alright, cats and kittens, who's ready for a movie?"
00:19:02.266,00:19:08.147,"Before we watch our movie, Catnip and I have been working on something special we want to show you guys."
00:19:08.230,00:19:09.398,Hit the lights.
00:19:10.315,00:19:13.068,"-Oh! What's it going to be? -Oh, boy! I can't wait!"
00:19:18.157,00:19:21.451,Pandy was chilling out and enjoying the sunshine.
00:19:24.872,00:19:27.291,"Hey, wait a minute. That's me!"
00:19:27.374,00:19:34.548,"When, all of a sudden… …the giant octopus captures Pandy!"
00:19:35.090,00:19:36.592,Look at that funny octopus.
00:19:41.138,00:19:42.222,"Hi, Floyd."
00:19:42.306,00:19:44.433,"Floyd, go save him!"
00:19:44.683,00:19:46.310,He's flying over.
00:19:46.768,00:19:47.936,"Go, Floyd!"
00:19:49.229,00:19:51.982,He sends the octopus back to the sea.
00:19:52.065,00:19:55.110,Hero Floyd has saved the day again.
00:19:55.694,00:19:57.070,Floyd did it!
00:19:57.154,00:20:01.617,"There goes Floyd, off to save someone else, I'm sure."
00:20:02.910,00:20:05.454,-Floyd's my hero! -That was cat-tastic!
00:20:06.205,00:20:10.000,"DJ Catnip, CatRat, thank you so much."
00:20:10.209,00:20:12.002,That was a-meow-zing!
00:20:12.085,00:20:13.462,You guys are the best.
00:20:13.545,00:20:14.713,It's no big deal.
00:20:19.134,00:20:21.511,Wow. What a great movie day.
00:20:21.595,00:20:23.931,We actually made two movies.
00:20:24.139,00:20:25.515,Thanks for all your help.
00:20:25.766,00:20:27.893,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:43.700,00:20:45.702,"It's me, Baby Box!"
00:21:42.551,00:21:43.552,Oops!
00:22:28.972,00:22:31.308,Today was definitely crafty-rrific.
00:22:31.767,00:22:34.352,"I just love making things with Baby Box, don't you?"
00:22:34.770,00:22:36.897,Thanks for your help making our movie today.
00:22:36.980,00:22:41.234,Come back next time and we'll open up another Dollhouse Surprise. Bye!
00:00:49.257,00:00:50.258,Hey!
00:00:50.341,00:00:52.135,Guess what today is?
00:00:52.719,00:00:55.722,It's Pandy's birthday!
00:00:55.805,00:00:58.224,"Yay! Happy Birthday, Pandy!"
00:01:06.524,00:01:08.401,"Oh, I love you so much."
00:01:08.943,00:01:12.280,The Gabby Cats and I made something super special for his birthday.
00:01:12.614,00:01:16.534,"But it's a surprise, Pandy, so you can't look at it until later."
00:01:17.077,00:01:19.829,Do you want to see what it is? OK.
00:01:22.957,00:01:29.547,The Gabby Cats and I made Pandy… …a picture frame!
00:01:30.215,00:01:33.343,And it has all the Gabby Cats on it. See?
00:01:33.718,00:01:35.094,There's CatRat.
00:01:35.345,00:01:36.763,That's DJ Catnip.
00:01:37.013,00:01:39.766,Kitty Fairy with her cute little diddly boppers.
00:01:42.852,00:01:43.853,Pillow Cat.
00:01:43.937,00:01:45.980,See her tiny little whiskers?
00:01:46.314,00:01:48.441,That's Baby Box.
00:01:48.525,00:01:53.154,"Cakey, me, and, of course, Pandy, the birthday cat."
00:01:53.238,00:01:54.197,Wahoo!
00:01:54.531,00:01:57.450,Do you think he's gonna like it? I sure hope so.
00:02:00.578,00:02:02.038,It was the Dollhouse Delivery.
00:02:02.330,00:02:04.541,"Come on, let's go check it out."
00:02:05.416,00:02:06.417,"Come on, Pandy."
00:02:19.264,00:02:23.268,I'm so excited to see what's in our Meow Meow Mailbox today!
00:02:23.768,00:02:24.602,OK.
00:02:25.728,00:02:27.105,Ooh!
00:02:27.188,00:02:28.815,Hmm.
00:02:29.274,00:02:32.694,"Hey, Pandy, do you recognize who this is?"
00:02:33.695,00:02:35.905,Do you recognize who this is?
00:02:37.949,00:02:40.076,That's right! It's Pandy.
00:02:40.160,00:02:42.912,"So it must be for him. Hey, do you want to open it?"
00:02:43.496,00:02:44.372,OK.
00:02:48.877,00:02:53.882,It's… a birthday hat!
00:02:55.091,00:02:58.177,For the birthday cat.
00:03:01.890,00:03:05.977,And now you're all ready for your birthday party. Hey!
00:03:06.436,00:03:09.939,Do you want to come in the Dollhouse and help us celebrate Pandy's birthday?
00:03:10.773,00:03:11.774,Great!
00:03:12.150,00:03:16.654,Now it's time to get tiny.
00:03:26.915,00:03:30.084,"Hey, it's me, Pandy. I'm in the Fairy Tail Garden."
00:03:30.168,00:03:32.420,Are you coming to my party? Come on in!
00:03:38.760,00:03:42.472,Thanks for coming to my party. It's gonna be paw-tastic!
00:03:42.555,00:03:44.224,"What are we gonna do first, Gabby?"
00:03:45.475,00:03:46.476,Gabby?
00:03:46.851,00:03:48.144,"Hey, where's Gabby?"
00:03:53.274,00:03:54.317,Hmm.
00:03:56.945,00:03:59.572,Happy Birthday hug attack!
00:04:01.824,00:04:04.535,You surprised me with a hug attack?
00:04:04.619,00:04:06.287,You got to be kitten me!
00:04:06.496,00:04:08.122,I learned from the best.
00:04:12.168,00:04:13.002,Ooh!
00:04:18.132,00:04:20.093,"Happy Birthday, Pandy!"
00:04:20.760,00:04:23.096,"Wahoo! Thanks, Kitty Fairy."
00:04:23.346,00:04:24.889,Are you ready for your party?
00:04:24.973,00:04:26.266,You bet I am!
00:04:27.558,00:04:30.645,"Well, then we're off to Birthday Island."
00:04:30.728,00:04:32.563,Birthday Island?
00:04:32.647,00:04:35.358,Yep. That's where your birthday party is.
00:04:35.441,00:04:38.861,It just takes a little garden magic to shrink us down.
00:04:40.947,00:04:43.074,Off we go!
00:04:46.202,00:04:47.245,Paw-esome!
00:04:48.121,00:04:49.289,Fly with me!
00:05:00.591,00:05:04.304,All aboard the Birthday Island Boat!
00:05:07.473,00:05:09.183,I'm all aboard for that.
00:05:09.434,00:05:11.394,And away we go!
00:05:29.495,00:05:31.789,MerCat at your service.
00:05:32.206,00:05:34.042,"Happy Birthday, Pandy."
00:05:34.625,00:05:37.754,"Thanks, MerCat. Do you know the way to Birthday Island?"
00:05:37.837,00:05:39.297,Of course I do!
00:05:39.672,00:05:40.757,Follow me.
00:05:44.510,00:05:47.430,"Come on. Birthday Island, here we come."
00:05:58.483,00:05:59.317,Look!
00:06:01.069,00:06:03.988,"Birthday Island is wearing a party hat, just like me!"
00:06:23.049,00:06:25.551,Welcome to Birthday Island.
00:06:25.635,00:06:27.678,This place is meow-mazing!
00:06:57.208,00:06:58.918,Who else is coming to my party?
00:06:59.001,00:07:07.927,"To find that out, you'll have to play our first birthday game, called… Guess That Guest."
00:07:17.979,00:07:23.192,Our first guest loves to coodle up in bed and tell a good story.
00:07:23.276,00:07:29.365,"And when things don't quite go the right way, this Gabby Cat just rolls with it."
00:07:32.952,00:07:37.331,"Loves to roll, and loves to coodle up, and loves stories."
00:07:37.707,00:07:39.333,Is it Pillow Cat?
00:07:47.049,00:07:49.802,"Thanks, Pillow Cat. I'm so glad you're here."
00:07:51.012,00:07:52.597,All right.
00:07:52.680,00:08:04.108,It's time to… Our next guest will bring the beats to move your seats.
00:08:04.317,00:08:08.237,"He'll make you move with his grooves, and he always brings the party."
00:08:08.321,00:08:10.615,Oh! I think I know who this is.
00:08:14.452,00:08:16.078,A singing Gabby Cat?
00:08:16.287,00:08:17.538,DJ Catnip?
00:08:19.207,00:08:20.791,DJ Catnip!
00:08:21.042,00:08:23.377,Whoo! Yeah!
00:08:23.461,00:08:25.254,Birthday wave!
00:08:30.051,00:08:30.885,Yeah!
00:08:31.302,00:08:32.637,"Awesome, DJ!"
00:08:32.929,00:08:35.556,"Oh, this is so exciting! Who's next?"
00:08:36.098,00:08:37.099,All right.
00:08:37.266,00:08:51.781,"Let's play… There's nothing this craft-o-riffic kitty can't create without a few pipe cleaners, pom-poms, and her trusty glue stick."
00:08:52.615,00:08:55.117,Hmm. Uses a glue stick?
00:08:55.201,00:08:58.704,"That sounds like Baby Box, but Baby Box isn't that tall."
00:09:02.083,00:09:03.793,"Happy Birthday, Pandy."
00:09:04.001,00:09:05.795,It is Baby Box!
00:09:05.878,00:09:08.089,I tried to trick you with stilts.
00:09:09.882,00:09:11.676,"That was a good one, Baby Box."
00:09:11.759,00:09:12.760,Whoa!
00:09:12.843,00:09:15.179,"Oh, snippets! I'm going down!"
00:09:15.263,00:09:16.430,I got you!
00:09:16.514,00:09:17.515,Thank you.
00:09:19.225,00:09:21.519,"Now, for our last party guest."
00:09:21.894,00:09:31.404,Who's ready to… I know that tail.
00:09:35.157,00:09:36.742,"Go for it, CatRat!"
00:09:50.756,00:09:54.844,"Now that everybody's here, who wants to get this party started?"
00:09:58.389,00:09:59.390,OK.
00:09:59.473,00:10:03.185,"Now, I think Baby Box has a birthday surprise for Pandy."
00:10:03.394,00:10:05.646,I sure do. Come on!
00:10:12.903,00:10:15.197,Pandy Goodie Bags!
00:10:15.281,00:10:18.534,"Look, Pandy. It's got little ears on top of the bag."
00:10:19.243,00:10:21.287,Goodie bags that look like me?
00:10:23.998,00:10:29.545,"Everyone, grab your bag and your marker, and follow me!"
00:10:36.594,00:10:39.805,"I gave Pandy a nice, big birthday smile."
00:10:44.769,00:10:45.603,Boop!
00:10:49.315,00:10:52.610,Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop.
00:10:58.032,00:11:01.577,"Thanks for showing us how to make these great goodie bags, Baby Box."
00:11:01.661,00:11:03.037,"You're welcome, Pandy."
00:11:03.120,00:11:04.955,Happy Birthday!
00:11:06.374,00:11:08.501,what are we gonna put in these beauties?
00:11:08.751,00:11:11.295,I think Kitty Fairy has the answer to that.
00:11:11.504,00:11:13.089,"I sure do, Gabby."
00:11:15.466,00:11:18.219,"Oh, and I hear it right now. Come on!"
00:11:24.058,00:11:25.476,"All right, Pandy."
00:11:25.559,00:11:27.937,Are you ready for my birthday surprise?
00:11:30.481,00:11:31.982,A piñata!
00:11:34.360,00:11:36.237,A pickle piñata?
00:11:36.654,00:11:38.322,You got to be kitten me!
00:11:38.406,00:11:39.990,I love pickles!
00:11:40.074,00:11:42.201,Is it full of goodies for my goodie bag?
00:11:42.284,00:11:44.495,You'll have to open it to find out.
00:11:44.578,00:11:47.123,"But first, we need to blindfold you."
00:11:48.874,00:11:49.875,Cool!
00:11:50.960,00:11:54.046,Now we spin you around three times.
00:11:59.135,00:12:05.474,"Now you try and find the piñata by playing the Hot and Cold game, and we'll give you hints."
00:12:05.558,00:12:08.561,"When you're getting closer, we'll say hot."
00:12:08.811,00:12:12.106,"But if you're getting further away, we'll say cold."
00:12:12.648,00:12:14.650,"Now, off you go!"
00:12:17.236,00:12:19.738,Whoa. I hope I'm going the right way.
00:12:22.241,00:12:23.826,Am I getting hotter or colder?
00:12:28.789,00:12:30.499,"I'm gonna get you, piñata!"
00:12:32.710,00:12:35.671,How about now? Hotter or colder?
00:12:38.215,00:12:39.216,Yes!
00:12:40.718,00:12:42.052,Hotter or colder?
00:12:45.347,00:12:46.390,Yes!
00:12:49.435,00:12:50.853,Hotter or colder?
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.608,But it was just hot.
00:13:02.490,00:13:03.491,Hotter.
00:13:03.782,00:13:04.909,Hotter!
00:13:05.409,00:13:07.661,You're spicy-jalapeño hot!
00:13:20.925,00:13:22.384,You did it!
00:13:22.551,00:13:27.223,"Now, to get it to release the candy, you have to use the magic wand."
00:13:29.683,00:13:31.435,A magic wand?
00:13:35.856,00:13:37.525,Hey! It moved!
00:13:41.070,00:13:42.404,I'll get him this time.
00:13:53.374,00:13:54.458,Candy for CatRat!
00:13:54.542,00:13:56.126,"All right, sharing is caring."
00:13:56.210,00:13:58.254,This is the best party ever!
00:14:02.341,00:14:04.176,These candies have my face on them.
00:14:04.552,00:14:06.679,They're Pandy Candy!
00:14:06.971,00:14:08.430,-Yeah! -Yay!
00:14:08.514,00:14:11.225,"Now, these are paw-esome!"
00:14:11.892,00:14:13.936,Do you see any more Pandy Candy?
00:14:14.019,00:14:15.062,Help us look.
00:14:18.566,00:14:19.775,Do you see any?
00:14:23.904,00:14:24.738,Really?
00:14:25.698,00:14:26.699,Thanks!
00:14:27.992,00:14:30.619,A little birthday snacky for my Packy.
00:14:31.871,00:14:33.330,DJ Catnip!
00:14:36.959,00:14:38.043,"OK, OK."
00:14:38.460,00:14:40.045,"Gather round, kitty cats."
00:14:43.591,00:14:44.800,"Come on, Pandy."
00:14:44.884,00:14:47.136,"I need you here with me, center stage."
00:14:47.219,00:14:48.345,"All right, Pandy."
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.931,"Now, this is something I've been working on for a while."
00:14:51.015,00:14:53.058,"I really hope you like it, birthday boy."
00:14:56.854,00:14:59.565,"Now, this song is called The Birthday Boogie."
00:14:59.648,00:15:02.526,The Birthday Boogie? That sounds cool!
00:15:02.693,00:15:04.194,It starts like this.
00:15:49.448,00:15:51.700,My own birthday song?
00:15:51.784,00:15:55.371,"Thanks, DJ Catnip. That was paw-tastic!"
00:15:58.791,00:16:01.126,Special delivery for the birthday cat.
00:16:03.212,00:16:05.673,Cakey! Carlita!
00:16:05.756,00:16:07.257,"Happy Birthday, Pandy!"
00:16:07.925,00:16:11.011,And we've got one last birthday surprise for you.
00:16:14.974,00:16:16.976,Your birthday cake!
00:16:22.815,00:16:25.150,"I made it special, just for you."
00:16:25.234,00:16:26.527,"Do you like it, Pandy?"
00:16:26.610,00:16:28.737,Like it? I love it!
00:16:32.866,00:16:35.035,Let's sing Happy Birthday to Pandy.
00:16:35.119,00:16:37.579,Wait! Just one more thing.
00:16:39.415,00:16:40.582,Now we're ready!
00:16:58.183,00:16:59.226,You guys!
00:16:59.435,00:17:02.438,This is the best birthday party in the whole world.
00:17:02.938,00:17:04.565,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
00:17:10.070,00:17:12.573,"Oh, no! My cake!"
00:17:12.990,00:17:14.950,"Cakey, I'm so sorry."
00:17:15.034,00:17:17.077,I ruined your beautiful cake.
00:17:17.745,00:17:20.789,"Don't worry, Pandy. It was a mistake."
00:17:21.415,00:17:23.042,But it's all smashed.
00:17:24.126,00:17:25.169,Smashed?
00:17:27.254,00:17:30.716,"We're not gonna have regular birthday cake for your birthday, Pandy."
00:17:30.799,00:17:33.844,We're gonna have smash cake!
00:17:34.386,00:17:35.554,Smash cake?
00:17:35.971,00:17:36.972,Yeah.
00:17:37.306,00:17:41.185,"Instead of worrying about the smashed part, just think about the cake part."
00:17:42.102,00:17:43.979,Mm! Cake.
00:17:44.313,00:17:47.524,"Cake is yummy, no matter what it looks like."
00:17:59.453,00:18:03.332,Whoa! This is way better than eating it the regular way.
00:18:03.415,00:18:05.125,"All righty, then!"
00:18:05.209,00:18:08.796,Make a wish and blow out your candle so we can all get in on the fun.
00:18:13.759,00:18:15.844,-What did you wish for? -Nothing.
00:18:16.220,00:18:18.055,Because my wish already came true.
00:18:18.388,00:18:21.266,This was the most paw-tastic birthday ever.
00:18:21.725,00:18:22.851,"Thanks, everybody."
00:18:25.104,00:18:27.731,Who's up for some smash cake?
00:18:30.692,00:18:32.361,"Happy Birthday, Pandy."
00:18:40.035,00:18:41.120,"Hey, everyone!"
00:18:46.416,00:18:49.586,"One, two, three!"
00:18:52.923,00:18:54.049,Check it out!
00:18:58.178,00:19:01.265,Pandy is never gonna forget this birthday.
00:19:03.433,00:19:07.479,"OK, Pandy, we've got one last surprise for you."
00:19:07.896,00:19:08.897,A present?
00:19:11.400,00:19:12.901,What a great picture!
00:19:13.152,00:19:14.736,And I love this frame.
00:19:15.195,00:19:17.114,Did you guys make this for me?
00:19:17.614,00:19:18.699,We sure did!
00:19:18.949,00:19:20.951,Yeah. We're all on there.
00:19:22.494,00:19:28.292,"You know, the best part of my birthday is I got to celebrate with all my cat-tastic friends."
00:19:34.756,00:19:36.717,Do you think Pandy liked his party?
00:19:57.404,00:19:58.780,"Oh, hi. It's me."
00:22:33.060,00:22:35.395,"I had a great time, and he did, too."
00:00:47.756,00:00:48.631,Hey!
00:00:48.715,00:00:52.510,Pandy and I were looking through some old photos of different trips we've gone on.
00:00:52.594,00:00:56.097,We always take pictures on all our trips so we can remember them later.
00:01:03.605,00:01:07.233,This was the time that Pandy and I went to the playground together.
00:01:07.650,00:01:09.277,He just loves slides.
00:01:10.904,00:01:13.490,"Oh, I remember this one!"
00:01:13.782,00:01:17.911,This is when we went to visit the farm and we got to feed all the chickens.
00:01:19.621,00:01:22.624,Hey! You know what that sound means.
00:01:22.707,00:01:24.918,It means it's time for a Dollhouse Delivery.
00:01:25.001,00:01:26.586,"Come on, let's go check it out."
00:01:36.471,00:01:40.183,Alright. Let's see what we have in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.
00:01:41.226,00:01:42.227,OK.
00:01:42.977,00:01:44.020,Whoa!
00:01:46.648,00:01:47.649,Hey.
00:01:54.489,00:01:55.615,Should we open it?
00:01:56.074,00:01:57.617,Yeah! Let's do it.
00:01:58.535,00:01:59.536,Alright.
00:02:00.870,00:02:07.710,"It's… an ice cube, with a little polar bear inside."
00:02:08.044,00:02:09.379,That's strange.
00:02:10.130,00:02:12.799,He looks friendly. See? He's waving.
00:02:14.134,00:02:16.427,"I wonder how you got in there, buddy."
00:02:17.262,00:02:20.765,"Well, I guess he can't tell us because he's stuck in an ice cube."
00:02:21.432,00:02:23.476,I think that we need to get him out of here.
00:02:23.685,00:02:26.980,"I bet someone in the Dollhouse could help us. Come on, let's go see."
00:02:29.315,00:02:33.194,Hmm. But which Gabby Cat should we ask for help?
00:02:35.113,00:02:38.700,MerCat's a scientist. I bet she'll know what to do.
00:02:39.159,00:02:41.369,Let's just put this little guy in here.
00:02:42.370,00:02:46.457,And now it's time to get tiny.
00:02:55.592,00:02:57.635,"I'm over here, in the bathroom."
00:02:57.719,00:02:58.720,Come on in!
00:03:00.471,00:03:02.140,Welcome to my Dollhouse.
00:03:02.515,00:03:03.850,First things first.
00:03:04.100,00:03:05.727,Let's find Pandy.
00:03:06.102,00:03:07.729,Pandy?
00:03:08.187,00:03:10.356,Where is he hiding this time?
00:03:12.775,00:03:14.402,Hug attack!
00:03:20.575,00:03:22.952,Why is there a frozen polar bear in my bathtub?
00:03:23.244,00:03:27.248,We were hoping you could help us figure out how to get him out of that ice cube.
00:03:27.332,00:03:32.879,"We tried to ask him, but we can't understand him because he's frozen in the ice cube."
00:03:34.964,00:03:37.425,"Yeah, we can't understand what he's saying in there."
00:03:39.344,00:03:42.639,Hmm. I think we need to melt this ice cube.
00:03:42.805,00:03:43.932,But how do we do that?
00:03:44.224,00:03:53.191,With a little… Spa salt melts ice.
00:03:53.524,00:03:54.984,What? Really?
00:04:04.911,00:04:05.954,Yes!
00:04:06.913,00:04:09.165,Hellodely-dodely!
00:04:11.084,00:04:12.126,I'm Pete.
00:04:12.293,00:04:16.047,"Hi, Pete. I'm Gabby. And this is MerCat and Pandy Paws."
00:04:16.130,00:04:17.590,Welcome to the Dollhouse.
00:04:20.051,00:04:23.304,-Of course! -Why were you frozen in that big cube?
00:04:23.554,00:04:28.476,"Well, it's the best way to travel from where I live, the frosty North Pole."
00:04:30.520,00:04:31.896,Do you know Santa?
00:04:32.188,00:04:33.898,"Oh, sure!"
00:04:34.107,00:04:35.942,He lives a few snow hills away.
00:04:36.025,00:04:39.153,He and Mrs. Claus are just the nicest folks.
00:04:39.362,00:04:40.697,Paw-esome!
00:04:43.157,00:04:48.663,"Well, you know, I-I love the North Pole and all, but I needed a little break from the cold."
00:04:49.956,00:04:52.417,So I decided to take a vacation.
00:04:52.875,00:04:56.462,It sounds like you could use a beach vacation to warm up.
00:04:56.546,00:04:57.547,Oh!
00:04:57.630,00:05:00.800,That does sound nice. I've never been to the beach.
00:05:03.928,00:05:04.929,Of course.
00:05:05.013,00:05:06.306,Wow!
00:05:06.389,00:05:08.099,You have your own beach?
00:05:11.436,00:05:13.646,But it's so tiny.
00:05:13.730,00:05:15.064,"Don't worry, Pete."
00:05:15.148,00:05:16.816,MerCat's got it covered.
00:05:17.150,00:05:22.030,"To get to the beach, we'll need a little spritz of my Song of the Sea Spray."
00:05:22.405,00:05:24.365,Song of the Sea Spray?
00:05:30.288,00:05:33.124,Wahoo-hoo! I'm shrinking!
00:05:38.838,00:05:40.965,That was fantastic!
00:05:41.215,00:05:44.218,"Around here, we call it cat-tastic."
00:05:44.427,00:05:47.472,Cat-tastic. I like it!
00:05:47.805,00:05:52.060,And we're gonna make sure you have the most cat-tastic day at the beach.
00:06:02.111,00:06:05.239,"-Oh. Hey, Carlita. Hey, CatRat. -Hey, gang."
00:06:05.323,00:06:08.242,"CatRat, you're looking sporty."
00:06:08.868,00:06:11.162,That's Beach Patrol CatRat.
00:06:13.206,00:06:15.625,And I'm here about your beach situation.
00:06:15.958,00:06:17.210,Beach situation?
00:06:17.418,00:06:21.005,Yeah. A situation means you're breaking a beach rule.
00:06:21.089,00:06:25.009,In this case… Beach rule number three.
00:06:25.093,00:06:27.929,No snowsuits on the beach.
00:06:28.179,00:06:30.264,"Oh, geez! S-Sorry about that."
00:06:33.684,00:06:36.562,"Yeah, this is his first trip to the beach, CatRat."
00:06:41.025,00:06:44.862,But lose the snowsuit and get yourself some beach clothes.
00:06:45.446,00:06:50.993,"Well, Pete, it looks like the first thing we're gonna do is find you some warm-weather beach clothes."
00:06:51.160,00:06:52.161,Really?
00:06:52.245,00:06:53.246,Of course.
00:06:53.579,00:06:55.998,"Alright, then. Carry on."
00:06:56.207,00:06:58.251,"Ooh, Carlita, it's an emergency."
00:06:58.334,00:07:00.711,We need to head to the hot-dog stand right away.
00:07:00.795,00:07:02.547,Is there a beach situation over there?
00:07:06.843,00:07:09.595,"Ooh. Sounds good to me. Bye, guys!"
00:07:12.306,00:07:13.349,Beep-beep!
00:07:13.641,00:07:18.479,Alright. Let's head over to Pillow Cat's Dress-Up Shack and get you all beachy.
00:07:18.771,00:07:19.939,"Oh, boy!"
00:07:20.022,00:07:21.149,Let's go!
00:07:21.232,00:07:22.650,Enjoy the beach!
00:07:22.733,00:07:23.734,Thanks.
00:07:32.118,00:07:34.078,Aww! She's dreaming.
00:07:34.454,00:07:35.830,We'll wake her gently.
00:07:36.372,00:07:37.415,Pillow Cat?
00:07:37.748,00:07:38.749,Pillow Cat?
00:07:42.003,00:07:43.921,Oh-oh! Who?
00:07:44.881,00:07:47.967,Oh. Was I catnapping again?
00:07:48.050,00:07:48.885,Yep.
00:07:49.343,00:07:53.306,"Oh. Well, I'm up and ready to roll now."
00:07:54.390,00:07:55.892,What can I do for you?
00:07:59.395,00:08:01.355,"Hi, Pete. I'm Pillow Cat."
00:08:01.439,00:08:02.899,Nice to meet you.
00:08:02.982,00:08:05.902,"Pete's from the North Pole, where it's really cold."
00:08:06.110,00:08:09.530,He's never been to the beach and really needs some beach clothes.
00:08:09.614,00:08:11.657,"Well, you've come to the right place."
00:08:11.741,00:08:14.285,I've got everything you need for a day at the beach.
00:08:22.919,00:08:23.878,Huh?
00:08:23.961,00:08:25.838,"Here, I'll show you."
00:08:26.047,00:08:28.633,Let's find you a beach shirt first.
00:08:28.841,00:08:29.842,Sure.
00:08:29.926,00:08:34.222,I've never even seen a beach shirt. I might need some help picking one out.
00:08:34.305,00:08:36.015,Just swipe the mirror.
00:08:36.349,00:08:38.559,"Alright, here I go!"
00:08:40.353,00:08:42.563,"Hey, is this a beach shirt?"
00:08:45.816,00:08:48.945,-No? -That's way too fancy for the beach.
00:08:49.028,00:08:50.696,"Swipe again, Pete."
00:08:50.905,00:08:51.864,OK.
00:08:54.075,00:08:55.993,Is this a good shirt for the beach?
00:08:57.870,00:08:58.829,No?
00:08:58.913,00:09:01.874,That's a sweater. You can't wear that on the beach.
00:09:01.958,00:09:03.459,It's way too hot.
00:09:05.711,00:09:07.171,Is this a beach shirt?
00:09:09.715,00:09:10.841,It is?
00:09:13.928,00:09:15.888,"That's a great beach shirt, Pete."
00:09:21.102,00:09:24.188,Now we need to do something about those snow pants.
00:09:24.397,00:09:26.107,Let's find you a bathing suit.
00:09:26.440,00:09:27.775,A bathing suit?
00:09:27.984,00:09:32.280,Yeah. It's like a special pair of shorts you can wear in the water.
00:09:32.446,00:09:35.908,You wear clothes to go into the water? Ha!
00:09:36.158,00:09:38.911,Who knew there was so much to learn about the beach?
00:09:39.161,00:09:41.747,I'm really gonna need your help with this one.
00:09:47.378,00:09:49.630,Oh! These look comfy.
00:09:49.839,00:09:51.382,Is this a bathing suit?
00:09:53.718,00:09:54.552,No?
00:09:54.844,00:09:58.264,"Those are PJ pants, for sleeping. Try again."
00:10:00.975,00:10:02.977,Is this a bathing suit?
00:10:06.564,00:10:07.857,I like this look.
00:10:10.943,00:10:13.571,Now you look like you're on vacation.
00:10:13.821,00:10:16.073,"Ooh! I do, don't I?"
00:10:16.240,00:10:18.326,"-Thanks, Pillow Cat. -Of course."
00:10:18.576,00:10:21.871,And thank you for helping me out with my new look.
00:10:22.038,00:10:24.290,Let's go show you how to have fun at the beach.
00:10:25.791,00:10:27.209,Enjoy!
00:11:02.411,00:11:05.414,"Pete! Oh, you look fantastic!"
00:11:13.547,00:11:16.050,We've got a beach situation here.
00:11:16.467,00:11:19.720,"But, CatRat, look. He's wearing his beach clothes."
00:11:19.970,00:11:22.223,Yeah. But you know what he's not wearing?
00:11:23.599,00:11:24.934,Sunscreen.
00:11:26.644,00:11:30.022,"It says right here, Beach rule number one."
00:11:30.231,00:11:33.859,Everyone on the beach must wear sunscreen.
00:11:34.235,00:11:35.319,Paws out.
00:11:39.657,00:11:40.658,"Oh, CatRat."
00:11:41.033,00:11:43.452,"You know, I don't think we met properly last time."
00:11:43.661,00:11:45.413,Hellodely-dodely!
00:11:45.496,00:11:46.539,Name's Pete.
00:11:47.915,00:11:49.667,"OK there, Pete."
00:11:50.167,00:11:54.547,"I'm just hoping we don't see anymore beach situations from you today, huh?"
00:11:57.216,00:12:00.845,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a beach to protect."
00:12:04.890,00:12:06.142,Let's ride.
00:12:12.731,00:12:15.568,"Alright, Pete, you ready for more beach fun?"
00:12:15.860,00:12:16.944,Sure!
00:12:17.361,00:12:19.238,Let's hunt for some beach treasure.
00:12:19.488,00:12:20.656,Beach treasure?
00:12:20.739,00:12:21.615,Yeah.
00:12:21.699,00:12:27.329,Like colorful seashells… or smooth stones.
00:12:29.081,00:12:30.249,Whoa!
00:12:30.499,00:12:33.085,You can find those cool things on the beach?
00:12:33.294,00:12:34.670,If you look carefully.
00:12:34.753,00:12:38.841,Yeah. Looking for beach treasure is one of my favorite things to do.
00:12:39.091,00:12:42.970,"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go find some beach treasure!"
00:12:47.558,00:12:51.353,"OK, here comes a wave. Let's look for some beach treasure."
00:13:01.822,00:13:02.656,Huh?
00:13:03.949,00:13:05.868,"Hey, where did my seashell go?"
00:13:06.243,00:13:09.288,You've got to grab it before the wave takes it back out again.
00:13:09.371,00:13:11.165,But what if I don't get it in time?
00:13:11.665,00:13:14.335,"Well, that's the fun of searching for beach treasure."
00:13:14.627,00:13:17.004,"Sometimes you get it, sometimes you don't."
00:13:17.087,00:13:20.466,You just have to wait and see what the next wave brings in.
00:13:20.716,00:13:23.969,"OK, here comes another wave. Let's look."
00:13:27.765,00:13:28.807,Hurry! Get it!
00:13:31.977,00:13:33.187,Whoa!
00:13:33.562,00:13:35.314,Check out this rock.
00:13:35.397,00:13:37.191,It's like a little rainbow.
00:13:42.321,00:13:43.656,Whoa!
00:13:44.198,00:13:47.117,Your hair matches my rainbow rock.
00:13:47.201,00:13:49.078,That's cat-tastic!
00:13:49.161,00:13:50.162,Thanks.
00:13:52.331,00:13:53.916,What else should we search for?
00:13:54.542,00:13:57.086,This is a white and blue shark-eye shell.
00:13:57.378,00:13:59.129,Kind of looks like a shark eye.
00:13:59.213,00:14:00.881,Let's see if we can find one.
00:14:06.428,00:14:09.265,Do you see a white and blue shark-eye shell?
00:14:11.433,00:14:13.352,"Yes! I see it, too!"
00:14:16.605,00:14:17.856,I-I got it!
00:14:18.148,00:14:19.858,A shark-eye shell.
00:14:20.150,00:14:23.028,You want to see my favorite beach treasure?
00:14:23.362,00:14:24.363,-Yes! -Yes!
00:14:27.241,00:14:29.952,That's my favorite kind of beach treasure.
00:14:30.035,00:14:34.373,"Yeah, the best beach day ever is when you find a piece of blue sea glass."
00:14:34.456,00:14:36.542,They're almost impossible to find.
00:14:36.750,00:14:38.335,Let's give it a go!
00:14:46.802,00:14:47.761,Nope.
00:14:49.597,00:14:52.766,We haven't found any sea glass yet.
00:14:53.183,00:14:57.271,Just got to keep looking. Let's see what the next wave brings in.
00:15:03.777,00:15:04.945,"I see it, too!"
00:15:06.739,00:15:07.823,Let's see what I got.
00:15:08.657,00:15:14.538,"I got green, white, and brown… Blue!"
00:15:14.872,00:15:16.916,I found blue sea glass!
00:15:17.207,00:15:21.045,You found blue sea glass on your first trip to the beach?
00:15:21.295,00:15:23.505,"You're having a paw-esome beach day, Pete."
00:15:24.506,00:15:25.841,Let's see what I got.
00:15:26.967,00:15:28.135,Whoa!
00:15:28.344,00:15:31.013,Look at all the special things I found.
00:15:31.388,00:15:33.557,It really is like treasure.
00:15:35.684,00:15:36.727,Baby Box!
00:15:38.729,00:15:40.981,"Hey, Baby Box. This is Pete."
00:15:41.398,00:15:44.234,"Hellodely-dodely! Nice to meet you, Baby Box."
00:15:46.153,00:15:47.696,"Nice to meet you, Pete."
00:15:47.947,00:15:51.575,Pete's from the North Pole. This is his first time at the beach.
00:15:51.659,00:15:54.119,And I'm having the time of my life!
00:15:54.536,00:15:56.914,What else can we do before I have to go back home?
00:15:57.122,00:16:02.294,"Hey, Baby Box, do you think you could help us make Pete a souvenir of his first beach vacation?"
00:16:02.670,00:16:03.671,Sure!
00:16:03.754,00:16:05.339,What's a souvenir?
00:16:05.422,00:16:10.427,A souvenir's something you take home with you so you remember the great time you had.
00:16:16.266,00:16:19.520,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What's that word you just said?"
00:16:19.603,00:16:20.604,Souvenir?
00:16:22.523,00:16:24.149,Beach situation!
00:16:24.358,00:16:26.986,No using words I don't know.
00:16:27.736,00:16:29.113,What's a souvenir?
00:16:37.246,00:16:38.163,Carry on.
00:16:41.834,00:16:43.919,"So, what kind of souvenir can I make?"
00:16:49.550,00:16:52.177,"Hey, Baby Box, what are you doing with this driftwood?"
00:16:52.344,00:16:53.387,Driftwood?
00:16:56.640,00:16:58.767,"Oh, like my beach treasure."
00:16:59.018,00:17:01.729,"Oh, you got some good ones!"
00:17:01.812,00:17:05.149,Those will look great on a driftwood souvenir.
00:17:05.232,00:17:08.193,What kind of beach souvenir can we make out of driftwood?
00:17:08.819,00:17:11.238,We're gonna make a driftwood picture frame.
00:17:11.488,00:17:12.698,How do I start?
00:17:12.781,00:17:18.871,"Well, the first thing you do is lay out four pieces of driftwood in a square shape."
00:17:23.292,00:17:25.919,"Uh, Pete, that's a triangle."
00:17:28.172,00:17:29.548,"Oh, right."
00:17:32.176,00:17:33.010,There!
00:17:33.302,00:17:36.388,Check out my driftwood picture frame!
00:17:38.682,00:17:39.516,Oops!
00:17:39.933,00:17:43.687,"Next, you tie the corners together with some pipe cleaners."
00:17:51.153,00:17:53.030,And now my favorite part.
00:17:53.113,00:17:54.239,Decorate!
00:18:04.291,00:18:05.793,Crafty-rrific!
00:18:09.630,00:18:11.715,Check out my souvenir frame!
00:18:13.634,00:18:15.677,"Oh, it's beautiful!"
00:18:15.761,00:18:18.013,I love where you placed all the shells.
00:18:18.097,00:18:19.223,Paw-esome!
00:18:26.146,00:18:29.024,"CatRat, not another beach situation?"
00:18:29.441,00:18:30.859,I'm afraid so.
00:18:31.151,00:18:39.451,"Beach rule number 85 says, All polar bears visiting the beach for the first time must… take a picture."
00:18:39.535,00:18:41.453,To put in my picture frame.
00:18:41.537,00:18:42.704,That's perfect!
00:18:42.955,00:18:45.666,"Oh, thank you, Mr. Beach Patrol CatRat."
00:18:45.749,00:18:47.292,That's a great idea.
00:18:47.709,00:18:49.753,"Yeah, yeah. Don't thank me."
00:18:49.837,00:18:52.881,"I don't make up the rules of the beach, I just enforce them."
00:18:53.590,00:18:56.218,"Now, everybody get together and say Pete."
00:19:02.558,00:19:05.519,"I will never, ever forget this vacation."
00:19:07.312,00:19:08.480,Neither will we.
00:19:08.730,00:19:10.524,"It was great meeting you, Pete."
00:19:10.691,00:19:11.900,Bear hug!
00:19:15.612,00:19:17.781,Do you hear jingle bells?
00:19:17.865,00:19:19.908,"Oh, that's my ride. I got to go."
00:19:20.659,00:19:22.411,Goodbye-dilly-idilly!
00:19:22.911,00:19:24.163,Wait a minute.
00:19:24.538,00:19:25.706,Jingle bells?
00:19:26.123,00:19:27.207,Who's his ride?
00:19:29.877,00:19:33.213,Merry Beachmas!
00:19:35.090,00:19:36.341,Santa?
00:19:36.675,00:19:43.098,"OK, this was the most cat-tastic beach vacation ever!"
00:19:43.682,00:19:45.851,Are you ready for another surprise?
00:20:00.532,00:20:03.285,"It's me, CatRat."
00:20:12.252,00:20:15.964,"Hey, do you want to help me and Carlita spot some beach situations?"
00:20:17.341,00:20:19.384,Great! Let's go.
00:20:19.676,00:20:24.973,"You tell me if you see anything that looks strange or silly, and I'll blow my whistle to fix it."
00:20:25.807,00:20:27.809,What's wrong with this picture?
00:20:31.521,00:20:34.191,It's raining under the blue umbrella?
00:20:36.443,00:20:38.612,Definitely a situation.
00:20:41.531,00:20:44.243,Thanks! This is so much better.
00:20:44.785,00:20:46.620,"Good eyes, Beach Patrol."
00:20:47.162,00:20:49.831,Let's see what other silly scenes we can find.
00:20:51.541,00:20:55.337,Wait a second. I think I see another beach situation.
00:21:04.012,00:21:06.640,Pillow Cat's hammock is upside down.
00:21:07.140,00:21:08.433,Let's help her out.
00:21:10.018,00:21:13.438,Oh! Whoa! Thanks for fixing my hammock.
00:21:14.064,00:21:16.400,You're pretty good at this Beach Patrol thing.
00:21:16.608,00:21:19.111,Let's see what other situations we can find.
00:21:27.911,00:21:29.204,"Look, Beach Patrol."
00:21:29.371,00:21:32.416,I think I see another beach situation up ahead.
00:21:32.916,00:21:35.961,Uh… What's silly about this picture?
00:21:41.091,00:21:42.634,Beach situation!
00:21:48.765,00:21:51.601,Thanks for helping us spot the silly situations.
00:21:51.685,00:21:53.854,The beach is better because of you.
00:21:54.146,00:21:55.522,See you next time.
00:22:00.527,00:22:05.198,Oh! I was making Pete a postcard to tell him thanks for the great day at the beach.
00:22:05.699,00:22:09.411,"See? There's me and Pandy, and we're at the beach."
00:22:09.786,00:22:12.080,Now all it needs is a stamp.
00:22:15.417,00:22:16.543,OK.
00:22:17.294,00:22:20.547,And now it's all ready for the North Pole.
00:22:22.215,00:22:23.258,In you go.
00:22:36.146,00:22:40.609,Come back next time and we'll open up another Dollhouse Surprise. Bye!
00:00:48.631,00:00:51.801,Oh! Hello! Pandy and I were just doing our exercises.
00:00:52.177,00:00:54.679,I'm trying to break my record and do ten sit-ups.
00:00:54.763,00:00:56.055,I'm already at seven.
00:00:56.264,00:00:58.767,"Hey, do you want to count with me? OK."
00:01:00.268,00:01:01.269,Eight.
00:01:03.146,00:01:04.314,Nine.
00:01:05.315,00:01:07.692,And ten!
00:01:07.942,00:01:09.444,Yay! I did it.
00:01:09.861,00:01:13.740,Now Pandy's gonna try to break his record and do five Pandy pull-ups.
00:01:13.823,00:01:15.241,Do you think he can do it?
00:01:15.325,00:01:17.160,I don't know. Let's see.
00:01:18.036,00:01:19.579,OK. One!
00:01:20.371,00:01:21.206,Two!
00:01:21.831,00:01:22.665,Three!
00:01:22.749,00:01:23.792,"You got this, Pandy."
00:01:25.460,00:01:27.462,And… five!
00:01:27.879,00:01:30.632,"Yes! You did it, Pandy! Good job."
00:01:32.842,00:01:34.928,You know what that sound means.
00:01:35.011,00:01:37.430,It means it's time for a Dollhouse Delivery.
00:01:37.514,00:01:38.848,Let's go see what it is.
00:01:49.818,00:01:52.779,"OK, let's see what's in our Meow Meow Mailbox today."
00:01:58.701,00:02:00.745,Our cat box is purple.
00:02:00.829,00:02:03.498,"And look, it has this cool headband on it."
00:02:04.082,00:02:06.793,And it even has a little jump rope on the side here.
00:02:07.085,00:02:08.086,Cool!
00:02:08.169,00:02:09.337,Should we open it?
00:02:09.921,00:02:11.297,Of course we should.
00:02:11.881,00:02:12.882,Alright.
00:02:17.345,00:02:20.348,It's the trophy for the Meow-Mazing Games.
00:02:20.849,00:02:26.229,Every year in the Dollhouse we play the Meow-Mazing Games to see who will win this trophy.
00:02:26.688,00:02:30.024,"Pandy, Carlita and I try our best, but so far we haven't won."
00:02:30.441,00:02:31.317,Yet.
00:02:32.694,00:02:35.738,Ooh! And these are the Doodads.
00:02:36.322,00:02:38.408,"They're super sporty, so they always win."
00:02:38.908,00:02:42.662,"But Pandy, Carlita and I have been working super hard this year."
00:02:42.745,00:02:44.706,It feels like it could be our year to win.
00:02:45.290,00:02:46.124,Hey.
00:02:46.708,00:02:51.087,How about you join Team Gabby Cats and we can play in the Dollhouse together?
00:02:51.421,00:02:52.255,Great!
00:02:52.547,00:02:56.217,"Come on. Now, let's get in there and play some games."
00:02:58.261,00:02:59.262,Check it out.
00:02:59.679,00:03:02.307,The playroom is all decorated for the Meow-Mazing Games.
00:03:02.390,00:03:06.144,"And right behind that purple, sparkly curtain is where we're gonna play."
00:03:07.145,00:03:10.231,I'll put the trophy in Carlita so she can take it inside.
00:03:11.190,00:03:14.235,And now it's time to get tiny.
00:03:15.361,00:03:20.825,"A pinch on my left Pinch, pinch on my right Grab Pandy's hand and hold on tight!"
00:03:24.120,00:03:27.040,"Hey, I'm in the playroom. Come on in!"
00:03:28.958,00:03:30.418,First things first.
00:03:30.501,00:03:31.920,Let's find Pandy.
00:03:33.671,00:03:34.672,Do you see him?
00:03:38.927,00:03:41.054,Hug attack!
00:03:48.186,00:03:49.229,Honk-honk!
00:03:50.104,00:03:51.356,"Hey, team."
00:03:51.731,00:03:53.733,"-Carlita! -Hey, Carlita."
00:03:53.816,00:03:55.109,I'm so excited!
00:03:55.401,00:03:58.363,I can't wait for the Meow-Mazing Games to start.
00:03:58.613,00:04:00.198,How are you guys feeling?
00:04:00.406,00:04:01.866,Feeling strong.
00:04:02.116,00:04:03.284,And ready to play.
00:04:03.368,00:04:06.246,Do you think we're finally gonna win that trophy?
00:04:06.454,00:04:07.538,No doubt!
00:04:07.872,00:04:11.834,You know what? We're gonna work as a team and give it everything we've got.
00:04:12.210,00:04:16.422,"We have each other, and that's a whole lot of meow-mazing stuff."
00:04:16.714,00:04:17.715,Team cheer?
00:04:18.466,00:04:19.592,OK.
00:04:19.676,00:04:23.137,"You're on the team, so say the team cheer with us."
00:04:23.721,00:04:26.349,"Go, Gabby Cats!"
00:04:26.432,00:04:27.517,Say it with us.
00:04:32.355,00:04:35.692,It's time for the Games to begin. Come on.
00:04:44.284,00:04:47.662,Whoa! This is paw-tastic on a whole 'nother level.
00:04:54.877,00:04:57.338,"Yeah, but so are they."
00:04:58.673,00:05:00.258,It's the Doodads!
00:05:00.341,00:05:02.302,They look even tougher than last year.
00:05:08.433,00:05:11.602,Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
00:05:14.689,00:05:18.651,"I'm CatRat, your charming and hilarious host."
00:05:27.118,00:05:28.953,"Alright, Catnip."
00:05:29.579,00:05:32.332,Let's get this party started!
00:05:34.083,00:05:36.169,"Now, let's meet our teams."
00:05:36.252,00:05:40.048,"On this side, Team Gabby Cats!"
00:05:47.805,00:05:51.684,And the newest member of Team Gabby Cats… That's you!
00:05:52.101,00:05:53.227,Wahoo!
00:05:55.605,00:05:56.773,You got this.
00:05:56.856,00:06:00.818,"And on this side, Team Doodads!"
00:06:09.827,00:06:18.086,"That's right, CatRat, but I know Team Gabby Cats has been working really hard, so we'll just have to wait and see who takes home the trophy this year."
00:06:19.587,00:06:25.676,"That sound means it's time for our first event, the Meow-Mazing Race!"
00:06:37.688,00:06:41.442,Whoever crosses the finish line first is our winner!
00:06:49.992,00:06:50.910,Whoa!
00:06:51.160,00:06:52.703,Their car looks fast.
00:07:02.421,00:07:03.798,On your mark.
00:07:07.135,00:07:08.511,Go!
00:07:19.355,00:07:22.900,"If I drive over that glue, I might get super stuck."
00:07:23.192,00:07:25.403,We need your help to avoid the glue.
00:07:25.820,00:07:27.447,Tell us which lane to take.
00:07:27.655,00:07:29.240,Which lane has no glue?
00:07:29.615,00:07:31.659,The left or the right?
00:07:33.953,00:07:34.954,The right!
00:07:37.415,00:07:40.001,Thanks! That was a close one.
00:07:43.796,00:07:45.715,Uh-oh! More glue up ahead!
00:07:53.681,00:07:55.766,Wow! Great job!
00:07:55.850,00:07:57.268,"Go, Carlita, go!"
00:08:02.940,00:08:05.526,It's… the Doodads!
00:08:05.610,00:08:08.070,But Team Gabby is right behind them.
00:08:08.154,00:08:09.989,Whoo! Look at them go!
00:08:15.661,00:08:18.247,"Oh, no! More glue up ahead."
00:08:18.331,00:08:19.832,Tell us which lane to take.
00:08:20.082,00:08:21.792,Which lane has no glue?
00:08:21.876,00:08:23.961,The left or the right?
00:08:27.673,00:08:30.801,Phew! You really saved my bumpers on that one.
00:08:33.679,00:08:36.474,"Oh, I can't wait to see who's in the lead."
00:08:37.475,00:08:40.311,It's Team Gabby Cats! It's a race to the finish!
00:08:40.394,00:08:42.647,But here come the Doodads!
00:08:43.439,00:08:45.358,"You can do this, Carlita!"
00:08:48.653,00:08:51.030,Whoo! Awesome!
00:08:51.280,00:08:53.866,Team Gabby Cats wins the race!
00:08:56.118,00:08:57.411,Alright!
00:08:57.578,00:08:59.872,Did you see how fast she was going?
00:09:00.873,00:09:04.043,"Oh, thanks! I couldn't have done it without you."
00:09:04.627,00:09:05.753,Team cheer?
00:09:19.350,00:09:22.812,What an exciting start to the Meow-Mazing Games!
00:09:23.020,00:09:30.069,"Well, the excitement is just beginning, because it's time for our next game, Rhythm Ropes!"
00:09:32.738,00:09:36.617,our teams have to swing the jump ropes to the rhythm of the music.
00:09:36.867,00:09:40.162,"The faster the music goes, the harder it is to jump."
00:09:40.580,00:09:44.500,First team to get tangled up in their ropes loses the game.
00:09:49.839,00:09:50.673,Huh?
00:09:51.007,00:09:52.008,Uh-oh!
00:09:52.466,00:09:54.010,My tire is flat!
00:09:54.302,00:09:56.637,I can't jump-rope like this. Look!
00:10:01.684,00:10:02.518,Hang on.
00:10:02.935,00:10:04.562,Pit-crew Cakey coming in.
00:10:07.398,00:10:09.442,I'll fix that tire up in a jiff.
00:10:13.988,00:10:15.573,All better.
00:10:16.032,00:10:17.033,Phew!
00:10:20.411,00:10:22.038,I'm always here for you.
00:10:22.413,00:10:23.247,Boop.
00:10:25.249,00:10:26.959,"Go get them, Gabby Cats!"
00:10:27.460,00:10:29.670,Let Rhythm Ropes begin!
00:10:41.432,00:10:42.725,Sing with us.
00:11:06.082,00:11:07.667,"Sweet hops, Carlita."
00:11:32.274,00:11:34.318,Let's just say I'm not known for my rhythm.
00:11:35.236,00:11:37.321,Sing with me to help me keep the beat.
00:12:08.227,00:12:10.563,Tough break for Team Gabby Cats.
00:12:23.367,00:12:24.660,"I'm sorry, guys."
00:12:25.453,00:12:29.790,"Your singing really helped, and I definitely tried my best."
00:12:34.587,00:12:38.757,and Team Doodads has one point for winning Rhythm Ropes.
00:12:39.091,00:12:42.720,So this next event is the tiebreaker for the trophy.
00:12:44.346,00:12:48.225,"Both teams, please take your places at the starting circles."
00:12:48.726,00:12:56.901,It's time to play… Glittering Game Balls!
00:12:58.736,00:13:04.116,Hidden all around the playroom are these little Glittering Game Balls.
00:13:16.921,00:13:24.970,And to make it even more interesting… Kitty Fairy has a special surprise for our teams.
00:13:33.979,00:13:35.105,Awesome!
00:13:46.325,00:13:48.077,Whoa! We get to fly!
00:13:48.536,00:13:50.287,This is paw-tastic!
00:13:50.371,00:13:52.164,I love flying!
00:13:52.373,00:13:53.832,The score is tied.
00:13:53.916,00:13:55.793,"And you know what that means, folks."
00:13:55.876,00:14:01.549,Whoever gets the most Glittering Game Balls will be the winner of the Meow-Mazing Games!
00:14:01.632,00:14:04.718,And this Meow-Mazing trophy.
00:14:06.011,00:14:14.103,"Ooh! I didn't realize how shiny you were. Shinies… Hey, hey, hey, hey! Don't even think about it, CatRat."
00:14:14.186,00:14:15.813,"OK, OK."
00:14:15.896,00:14:17.523,I was just admiring it.
00:14:19.358,00:14:23.946,It's time to play Glittering Game Balls!
00:14:25.739,00:14:27.700,"Oh, man. A tiebreaker."
00:14:27.783,00:14:31.453,"I know. I'm so nervous, my tires are sweating."
00:14:31.537,00:14:36.292,"Come on, guys. We can do this. We just need to focus and work as a team."
00:14:36.375,00:14:40.421,Let's do the Team Gabby Cats cheer one last time. Ready?
00:14:48.470,00:14:51.682,"Alright, folks. The official timer is set."
00:14:52.099,00:14:53.601,On your marks.
00:14:54.101,00:14:55.352,Get set.
00:14:57.146,00:15:00.065,Find those Glittering Game Balls!
00:15:00.482,00:15:02.735,"OK, let's start looking."
00:15:03.193,00:15:05.821,Tell me if you see a Glittering Game Ball.
00:15:10.451,00:15:12.661,"I see it, too. Let's go!"
00:15:13.746,00:15:17.291,Oh! Looks like Gabby spotted one up high.
00:15:17.833,00:15:21.378,"But two of the Doodads seem to be going after it, too."
00:15:22.379,00:15:25.925,Oh! The Doodads not working as a team there.
00:15:26.008,00:15:26.967,We got it!
00:15:30.346,00:15:32.932,And Team Gabby Cats is in the lead.
00:15:36.560,00:15:37.728,Help me look.
00:15:44.818,00:15:45.736,I see it.
00:15:46.278,00:15:47.404,Let's go for it!
00:15:52.618,00:15:55.746,"Uh-oh! The Green Doodad sees it, too. We've got to hurry."
00:15:57.998,00:16:00.459,Whoa! Look at Carlita go!
00:16:03.712,00:16:07.132,"Well, grind my gears. We'll just have to look for another one."
00:16:15.140,00:16:18.686,Oh! The Doodads found another ball!
00:16:18.769,00:16:20.771,Team Doodads taking the lead!
00:16:21.647,00:16:23.691,Pandy looking for another ball.
00:16:28.153,00:16:29.530,We're tied again.
00:16:29.780,00:16:33.033,"Uh-oh! The Orange Doodad found one, too."
00:16:33.117,00:16:34.785,They're back in the lead.
00:16:35.411,00:16:37.079,But what's this?
00:16:38.205,00:16:40.624,Carlita tying the score!
00:16:45.838,00:16:48.132,We've got to catch up. Come on!
00:16:58.267,00:16:59.893,No! We have to get it!
00:17:02.938,00:17:03.939,After it!
00:17:12.114,00:17:15.159,Who's coming out with that Glittering Game Ball?
00:17:22.499,00:17:23.500,Yay!
00:17:24.501,00:17:25.669,Whoo!
00:17:26.795,00:17:28.047,The teams are tied!
00:17:28.756,00:17:30.549,And time is running out.
00:17:30.883,00:17:34.053,Will either team be able to find another ball for the win?
00:17:39.224,00:17:41.477,Tell me if you see another Glittering Game Ball.
00:17:49.651,00:17:50.819,I see them!
00:17:59.703,00:18:01.705,Oh! Did you see that?
00:18:03.290,00:18:07.878,Can either of them come up with a Glittering Game Ball before the buzzer?
00:18:17.012,00:18:19.389,The game ends in a tie!
00:18:21.225,00:18:22.684,Wait. Could it be?
00:18:23.644,00:18:26.939,Pandy found three Glittering Game Balls!
00:18:27.397,00:18:30.818,I can't believe it. Seeing it with my own eyes and I still can't believe it.
00:18:33.904,00:18:35.030,Yeah! Yee-haw!
00:18:35.114,00:18:36.115,We did it!
00:18:46.166,00:18:50.504,Team Gabby Cats has won the Meow-Mazing Games!
00:18:53.799,00:18:55.300,"We did it, guys!"
00:18:55.384,00:18:56.426,Awesome!
00:18:56.510,00:18:57.553,Yeah!
00:18:58.428,00:19:01.515,"Congratulations, Team Gabby Cats!"
00:19:01.890,00:19:05.060,"This year, the trophy belongs to you."
00:19:05.352,00:19:07.980,-Alright! -Wahoo! Yeah!
00:19:08.188,00:19:09.231,We did it!
00:19:09.606,00:19:12.776,We worked as a team and we won the trophy.
00:19:20.200,00:19:24.788,"Hey, guys, remember how disappointed we felt last year when we lost?"
00:19:26.665,00:19:28.375,That was a real bummer.
