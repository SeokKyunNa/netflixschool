00:00:33.908,00:00:34.951,Illuminat...
00:00:56.056,00:00:59.726,"The year was 1985, and the number one show on TV was..."
00:00:59.809,00:01:02.187,Evil Bratt!
00:01:06.649,00:01:11.196,and criminal mastermind bent on world domination.
00:01:16.117,00:01:19.370,I've been a bad boy!
00:01:19.454,00:01:25.585,"Bratt was the biggest child actor of the 1980s, striking a chord with audiences all over the world."
00:01:28.129,00:01:29.339,There he is! Get him!
00:01:33.218,00:01:35.845,I've been a bad boy!
00:01:37.972,00:01:39.182,Boy? Ugh!
00:01:39.265,00:01:51.111,"The show was canceled. Hollywood rejected him and Bratt quickly plunged into a downward spiral, starting to actually believe he was the character he played on TV."
00:01:51.194,00:01:52.612,What are you looking at?
00:02:03.498,00:02:04.791,"You know what, Clive?"
00:02:04.874,00:02:10.964,"Playing a villain on TV was fun, but being one in real life is even better."
00:02:11.172,00:02:12.298,Heist music!
00:02:12.382,00:02:13.550,Here it comes.
00:02:19.389,00:02:21.057,How is that heist music?
00:02:21.141,00:02:22.433,Sorry. My bad.
00:03:02.140,00:03:03.391,Mommy!
00:03:08.813,00:03:12.233,"Sir, the ship has been boarded by some kind of monster!"
00:03:12.317,00:03:13.735,Wait! That's not a monster.
00:03:14.193,00:03:16.654,That's a man wearing shoulder pads!
00:03:16.738,00:03:20.909,There's only one supervillain whose fashion sense is quite that dated.
00:03:20.992,00:03:22.785,Balthazar Bratt.
00:03:22.911,00:03:25.496,Blast it! The Dumont Diamond is on that ship.
00:03:25.580,00:03:29.667,I want every agent in the area on the scene immediately!
00:03:34.964,00:03:37.842,We're already here. Agents Grucy are closing fast.
00:03:37.926,00:03:40.511,Yes! Wait. What did you call us?
00:03:40.595,00:03:44.057,"Grucy. You know, Gru and Lucy mushed together. Try it."
00:03:44.140,00:03:46.893,"Oh! I like it, but not a lot."
00:03:46.976,00:03:48.269,I don't like it.
00:03:53.441,00:03:55.526,-Stop! -On the ground!
00:04:18.424,00:04:19.717,"Go, go, go!"
00:04:44.534,00:04:46.577,Wha?
00:04:46.786,00:04:47.870,He's getting away!
00:04:47.954,00:04:49.580,That's what he thinks.
00:04:55.753,00:04:57.171,Go! Go! Go...
00:05:04.512,00:05:06.306,"I don't think we can make it, Gru!"
00:05:06.389,00:05:07.432,We can make it!
00:05:09.642,00:05:12.603,We can make it!
00:05:14.814,00:05:16.482,"No, we can't!"
00:05:16.566,00:05:17.650,Ahh!
00:05:17.942,00:05:19.068,Get ready!
00:05:20.695,00:05:22.447,Get ready for wha...
00:05:43.134,00:05:44.677,"Go get him, Gru-Gru!"
00:05:45.470,00:05:46.721,"Hello, Gru."
00:05:48.264,00:05:49.599,How's your transition coming?
00:05:49.682,00:05:53.227,"You know, from world's worst villain to world's worst agent?"
00:05:53.311,00:05:55.730,"Oh, that's hilarious. You should be on TV."
00:05:55.813,00:05:59.275,"Oh, that's right. You were! But then you got canceled!"
00:06:02.070,00:06:03.279,-What about that? -Ugh!
00:06:03.488,00:06:06.324,"-What? Oh, girls! -Oh!"
00:06:09.035,00:06:09.952,Dance fight!
00:06:23.299,00:06:24.300,Ow!
00:06:28.429,00:06:32.183,"Alpha Team, the diamond is secure. Come and pick up the package."
00:06:40.399,00:06:41.275,Gru!
00:06:41.776,00:06:43.611,Did you actually think I was unconscious?
00:06:43.694,00:06:46.239,"-Huh! -It's called acting, hoser."
00:06:46.322,00:06:48.491,"And clearly, I've still got it!"
00:07:03.381,00:07:06.342,I've been a bad boy!
00:07:09.637,00:07:10.555,Son of a Betamax!
00:07:14.976,00:07:16.436,"This isn't over, Gru."
00:07:16.519,00:07:19.480,You hear me? This is not over.
00:07:19.564,00:07:22.608,"Yeah? Well, I still have the diamond."
00:08:09.572,00:08:12.408,I can't believe Bratt got away again.
00:08:12.492,00:08:14.452,How is this possible? How?
00:08:22.210,00:08:26.130,"And it's not just that he got away, it is he's so smug about it."
00:08:26.214,00:08:29.217,"Ooh, I've been a bad boy!"
00:08:29.300,00:08:33.304,"-Gah! -Edna, hey! Looking hot today."
00:08:33.513,00:08:35.389,Got cats on you.
00:08:35.473,00:08:40.394,"And it was so humiliating, dangling there in the bubble-gum Speedo."
00:08:40.686,00:08:47.902,"And I didn't have time to go to the gym this week, and I had a big breakfast. And was feeling a little bloated."
00:08:50.446,00:08:52.406,You know what? He's not even worth talking about.
00:08:52.615,00:08:56.494,I don't even want to waste another breath about the guy.
00:08:56.577,00:08:58.496,And another thing!
00:08:59.038,00:09:03.376,"Next time I see Bratt, I will moonwalk all over his stupid face!"
00:09:08.047,00:09:11.300,Thank you all for coming at such short notice.
00:09:11.926,00:09:20.810,"It is with great sadness that I inform you that, as of today, I am retiring as head of the AVL."
00:09:22.895,00:09:24.063,"Oh, no!"
00:09:24.605,00:09:29.277,Your new leader is coming directly from head office.
00:09:29.485,00:09:31.612,Effective immediately.
00:09:32.154,00:09:39.453,"She is the very gifted, very ambitious, Miss Valerie da Vinci."
00:09:40.079,00:09:45.710,"As I look out over all your faces, I am flooded with so many memories."
00:09:45.918,00:09:48.713,"Oh, boy! This is a snooze fest!"
00:09:48.796,00:09:49.630,"Excuse me, this is my last..."
00:09:49.714,00:09:50.715,"Blah, blah, blah! We understand."
00:09:50.798,00:09:53.009,"You're old, you're fat, you're done."
00:10:02.268,00:10:05.021,which one of you losers is Agent Gru?
00:10:06.439,00:10:08.733,"Oh, that would be me."
00:10:08.816,00:10:12.778,"Although, I don't know if I'd say loser, per se."
00:10:16.824,00:10:18.326,"Oh, it's the girls!"
00:10:18.409,00:10:19.702,Not a good time.
00:10:20.202,00:10:21.537,-Hey! -Ahh!
00:10:23.706,00:10:25.916,Ma'am? You're making me nervous.
00:10:26.000,00:10:32.715,"How could you let Balthazar Bratt, the AVL's most wanted villain, just get away?"
00:10:32.798,00:10:35.009,That is the opposite of what we do here!
00:10:35.092,00:10:36.135,"Okay, okay."
00:10:36.302,00:10:39.347,"Yes, maybe he got away. Again."
00:10:39.430,00:10:41.891,But he didn't get the diamond.
00:10:42.099,00:10:45.061,And I am this close to bringing him in.
00:10:45.144,00:10:47.396,This close.
00:10:47.480,00:10:49.106,Huh. Interesting.
00:10:49.315,00:10:50.524,You're fired!
00:10:51.942,00:10:54.612,That's totally not fair. Gru is a great agent!
00:10:54.695,00:10:58.532,"You know what? If you fire him, you're gonna have to fire me, sister-sister."
00:10:58.616,00:11:00.576,And do you really wanna do that?
00:11:00.743,00:11:02.119,Do ya?
00:11:10.586,00:11:11.796,"Well, I guess she did."
00:11:17.802,00:11:19.637,"Honey, you didn't have to do that."
00:11:19.720,00:11:21.347,I know how much you love your job.
00:11:21.430,00:11:23.891,"Well, I love other things more."
00:11:26.477,00:11:28.854,"You know, we're gonna have to tell the girls."
00:11:28.938,00:11:30.648,Can you do it?
00:11:30.731,00:11:33.567,The whole mom thing is still kind of new to me.
00:11:33.651,00:11:34.652,"Oh, sure."
00:11:37.321,00:11:38.197,Huh?
00:11:50.000,00:11:51.085,Hello?
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.644,This is unexpected.
00:12:08.727,00:12:10.938,"Well, you never got to go on a honeymoon, so..."
00:12:11.021,00:12:12.440,We made you dinner!
00:12:12.523,00:12:13.732,It's a luau!
00:12:13.816,00:12:16.360,We got pineapples and coconuts and ukuleles!
00:12:16.444,00:12:18.320,-Oh! Yay! -Yay!
00:12:34.587,00:12:36.213,Madame and Monsieur.
00:12:36.755,00:12:38.466,The gummy bears were my idea.
00:12:43.179,00:12:46.432,Mmm! Looks too good to even eat.
00:12:48.642,00:12:51.020,-But I made it for you. -Oh.
00:12:54.940,00:13:01.655,Good soup! I love the combination of gummy bears and meat.
00:13:07.745,00:13:09.246,I'm gonna hold it in my mouth.
00:13:09.455,00:13:11.165,"'Cause it's so good, I don't wanna swallow it."
00:13:11.248,00:13:12.708,"So, how was work?"
00:13:12.875,00:13:16.295,"Ooh, did you take that guy down? Did anything explode?"
00:13:16.378,00:13:25.346,"Well, actually, today, Lucy and I were invited to not work at the AVL anymore."
00:13:30.267,00:13:31.393,You got fired?
00:13:31.477,00:13:33.646,"Oh, no! No, no, no."
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.776,But don't worry.
00:13:38.859,00:13:41.570,I'm sure we'll get new jobs. Real soon.
00:13:43.906,00:13:46.784,What's better than being super-cool secret agents?
00:13:48.452,00:13:50.871,"Ooh, I know! You could gamble online!"
00:13:50.955,00:13:52.748,That's what Katie's dad does.
00:13:52.831,00:13:55.876,Okay. We will definitely look into that.
00:13:55.960,00:13:57.628,That's a good suggestion.
00:13:57.836,00:14:01.340,And let's not go over to Katie's house anymore.
00:14:03.259,00:14:04.093,Hmm?
00:14:10.683,00:14:11.725,"No, no, no."
00:14:11.809,00:14:14.645,This does not mean that we are going back to being villains.
00:14:17.856,00:14:19.775,"Okay, all right. I get it."
00:14:20.317,00:14:22.486,"Look, I know it's been a little tough lately."
00:14:22.820,00:14:27.783,Especially with Dr. Nefario accidentally freezing himself in carbonite.
00:14:31.287,00:14:34.039,But our life of crime is over!
00:14:35.791,00:14:38.752,"Mel! Mel, you're with me on this, right?"
00:14:57.938,00:15:00.858,"Guys, listen to me! Read my lips!"
00:15:07.907,00:15:08.949,What? What?
00:15:09.033,00:15:11.869,Oh... What did I say? It's not comquit?
00:15:12.620,00:15:13.621,"Ah, okay."
00:15:18.751,00:15:22.212,Don't take that tone with me! We're not going back to villainy.
00:15:23.839,00:15:26.550,Yes! And I don't want to hear another word about it.
00:15:31.096,00:15:35.476,"Look, if you guys don't stop right now, there will be consequences."
00:15:37.811,00:15:39.980,Hey! Don't say anything you're going to regret.
00:15:44.610,00:15:46.195,What? You quit?
00:15:47.071,00:15:49.114,You're serious? Come on!
00:15:57.873,00:16:01.126,"Great news, guys. You have been promoted."
00:16:01.210,00:16:04.338,You're in charge now. Huh? Not bad.
00:16:13.430,00:16:14.723,Jeesh!
00:16:37.121,00:16:42.501,To what do we owe the presence of the world's foremost gem expert?
00:16:42.584,00:16:44.628,The chief of police sent me.
00:16:44.712,00:16:51.010,"He was concerned that during the recent heist attempt, the Dumont Diamond was replaced with a phony."
00:17:08.944,00:17:09.945,"Ooh, la-la!"
00:17:10.029,00:17:12.656,You have been duped!
00:17:14.408,00:17:15.492,Yes.
00:17:15.784,00:17:17.077,By me!
00:17:20.622,00:17:21.707,"But, what is..."
00:17:25.210,00:17:26.295,"Oh, no! Help!"
00:17:45.814,00:17:48.400,I've been a bad boy!
00:17:48.484,00:17:49.693,Or should I say...
00:18:07.336,00:18:08.337,Oh!
00:18:31.318,00:18:32.361,"Hey, Gru."
00:18:32.903,00:18:34.238,What you doing down here?
00:18:34.780,00:18:37.241,In the dark. Alone.
00:18:37.324,00:18:39.409,"Oh, nothing. Just thinking."
00:18:40.244,00:18:41.537,You okay?
00:18:41.620,00:18:44.206,"Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine."
00:18:46.291,00:18:51.672,I don't know. I guess I just feel like a failure.
00:18:52.256,00:18:54.299,Like I don't have a purpose anymore.
00:18:54.383,00:18:57.553,"Hey, mister, you are not a failure."
00:18:58.095,00:19:01.056,If only I could have nailed Bratt.
00:19:01.473,00:19:04.434,"So many times, I almost had him."
00:19:04.893,00:19:09.815,"But now I'll never get the chance, 'cause I have been kicked to the curb."
00:19:09.898,00:19:11.275,"Gru, you've got to let this go."
00:19:11.358,00:19:13.235,It's time to look forward.
00:19:13.318,00:19:15.487,Things will get better. I promise.
00:19:37.968,00:19:39.303,Excuse me.
00:19:39.511,00:19:42.723,"Pardon me, young people?"
00:19:43.515,00:19:45.809,Would you tell me how to get to this address?
00:19:50.272,00:19:52.107,I'm looking for a Mr. Gru.
00:20:05.245,00:20:06.496,Idiots.
00:20:11.835,00:20:13.795,"Stop! Kyle, let go!"
00:20:18.217,00:20:19.218,No! No!
00:20:19.301,00:20:21.220,You've got to be kidding me!
00:20:21.303,00:20:22.304,"Lucy, did you..."
00:20:24.264,00:20:26.516,And he's really good to snuggle with.
00:20:26.600,00:20:28.268,"Oh, no, no, no. Agnes! Agnes!"
00:20:32.147,00:20:34.233,"Agnes, what are you doing?"
00:20:34.900,00:20:36.652,You sold your unicorn?
00:20:36.735,00:20:41.198,"Well, I just wanted to help, since you don't have a job."
00:20:41.281,00:20:43.158,I got two whole dollars for it.
00:20:46.453,00:20:47.746,"Uh, excuse me?"
00:20:48.330,00:20:49.998,"Sorry, buddy, the sale's over."
00:20:50.082,00:20:51.833,"Yes, but this will only take a..."
00:20:51.917,00:20:54.294,"Hey, eyebrows, get off the lawn."
00:20:55.712,00:20:56.964,"Hey, could you..."
00:20:57.172,00:20:58.882,"Oh, uh, of course."
00:20:59.091,00:21:01.343,"Now, as I was saying, I..."
00:21:01.510,00:21:02.636,Uh... Oh.
00:21:09.643,00:21:13.981,"Listen, Agnes, you don't need to worry. We're going to be fine."
00:21:14.064,00:21:15.065,For real?
00:21:15.148,00:21:16.149,For real.
00:21:16.358,00:21:18.277,"Now, come on, let's pack this stuff up."
00:21:21.071,00:21:22.698,"Buddy, you're not getting the hint."
00:21:22.781,00:21:28.829,"Excuse me, Mr. Gru, but I really must have a word with you."
00:21:29.371,00:21:30.580,How do you know my name?
00:21:30.664,00:21:33.959,Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fritz.
00:21:37.379,00:21:41.842,"And I am inquiring on behalf of your twin brother, Dru."
00:21:41.925,00:21:43.302,He needs your help.
00:21:43.385,00:21:45.345,What? Twin brother?
00:21:47.389,00:21:48.348,"Oh, ja."
00:21:48.432,00:21:51.685,He would like to fly you to Freedonia to meet him.
00:21:51.768,00:21:54.730,Your father has recently passed away and...
00:21:57.024,00:22:02.446,"I'm sorry, but my dad died when I was a baby, and I don't have any brother. You got the wrong guy."
00:22:02.529,00:22:07.826,"Really? Well, then, how do you explain this?"
00:22:19.129,00:22:20.297,"Oh, hello, Gru."
00:22:20.380,00:22:21.465,"Hi, Mom."
00:22:22.257,00:22:25.510,It's important to keep active in one's golden years.
00:22:27.471,00:22:29.931,"There you are, you cutie, you."
00:22:32.851,00:22:35.687,"Uh, these are my diving instructors."
00:22:36.188,00:22:39.232,Vincenzo und Paolo.
00:22:40.525,00:22:41.818,"Ciao, boys."
00:22:45.238,00:22:47.783,"Mom, do I have a twin brother?"
00:22:47.866,00:22:51.078,Ah! How did you find out? Who told you?
00:22:51.161,00:22:52.621,"Wait, what? It's true?"
00:22:52.704,00:22:54.581,You never told me I had a brother!
00:22:54.664,00:22:58.293,And you told me that Dad died of disappointment when I was born.
00:23:01.838,00:23:04.508,Agreement? What are you talking about?
00:23:07.677,00:23:13.308,"Shortly after you and your brother were born, your father and I divorced."
00:23:13.391,00:23:20.107,We each took one son to raise on our own and promised never to see each other again.
00:23:23.777,00:23:25.695,I got second pick.
00:23:28.615,00:23:30.534,I have a brother!
00:23:37.457,00:23:40.210,"Hey, girls! How are things in Row B, huh?"
00:23:40.293,00:23:42.587,I put together some fun activities for the trip!
00:23:42.796,00:23:45.799,Who is up for some gin rummy?
00:23:45.924,00:23:47.968,"Yeah, um..."
00:23:48.468,00:23:49.761,We're good.
00:23:49.845,00:23:51.555,"Oh, okay."
00:23:51.638,00:23:54.057,I'll just sit here and play solitaire.
00:23:54.307,00:23:55.475,I hope I win.
00:23:56.726,00:23:59.312,I wonder what Dru will be like. Ooh!
00:23:59.396,00:24:04.192,"Maybe we'll have the twin thing when you can read each other's minds, no?"
00:24:04.276,00:24:05.652,How cool would that be?
00:24:34.681,00:24:36.349,It's like a castle!
00:24:36.683,00:24:39.936,I can't wait to meet my brother!
00:24:40.478,00:24:42.731,Ugh. What's with all the pigs?
00:24:42.814,00:24:45.192,This is the family business.
00:24:45.275,00:24:48.445,The largest pig farm in the whole of Freedonia.
00:24:52.199,00:24:54.492,No! That's my private part!
00:25:11.968,00:25:14.429,"Oh, this is amazing!"
00:25:14.930,00:25:18.475,"Ah, it's like the Sistine Chapel! But with pigs."
00:25:23.021,00:25:26.274,My brother!
00:25:32.614,00:25:33.698,Gru!

00:26:04.229,00:26:21.413,How is my brother finding a wife like you And it makes me wanna put you into my pocket.
00:26:21.496,00:26:22.956,You can't do that!
00:26:23.498,00:26:24.916,I'm too big.
00:26:25.000,00:26:29.879,Ah! Edith! I can tell that you are a little mischievous.
00:26:29.963,00:26:32.173,We're gonna have to make a little trouble later.
00:26:34.759,00:26:36.970,Ow! Ow! Please!
00:26:37.053,00:26:39.306,Why are you doing that? Ow!

00:26:43.476,00:26:46.438,"And Margo. Oh, you are so mature!"
00:26:46.521,00:26:48.857,I'm guessing... Mmm... 15?
00:26:49.399,00:26:50.525,15?
00:26:50.608,00:26:54.112,She's 12. She looks 12 and will always be 12.
00:26:54.195,00:26:57.407,"So, Dru, this place is amazing!"
00:26:57.490,00:26:59.534,"I mean, you just walk through the doors and you're like..."
00:27:01.161,00:27:03.830,"Oh, it's nice, I guess, sure."
00:27:03.913,00:27:05.915,I'm not really into things.
00:27:15.759,00:27:18.136,"Yes, the best!"
00:27:19.387,00:27:20.472,Home? Why?
00:27:20.555,00:27:28.813,"I don't know. This guy with the mansion and the cars and all of the hair, with the silky smooth, luxurious hair."
00:27:28.897,00:27:31.232,I feel worse than I did before I came.
00:27:31.316,00:27:34.402,"But he's your brother, Gru. Give this a chance."
00:27:34.486,00:27:40.492,"Oh, I was thinking, while Gru and I catch up on some brother stuff, you girls should go with Fritz. He has a surprise for you!"

00:28:31.000,00:28:33.628,Does no one value true art anymore?
00:28:33.711,00:28:36.005,"It's a disgrace and a travesty, sir."
00:28:36.089,00:28:39.759,"Well, now that I've got the diamond, it's payback time."
00:28:39.843,00:28:43.763,"Oh, it's too bad Gru won't be around to try and stop me."
00:28:43.847,00:28:46.433,"Oh, wait! No, it's not. I hate that dweeb!"

00:30:36.125,00:30:39.629,He was so proud of you. And what a great villain you were.
00:30:41.840,00:30:44.843,"But me, eh, not so much."
00:30:45.260,00:30:49.848,"To Dad, I was just a failure."
00:30:50.807,00:30:53.518,He never thought I had what it took to be a villain.
00:30:53.601,00:30:56.813,"But now, you can help me prove him wrong!"
00:30:57.647,00:31:02.068,"Brother, teach me the art of villainy!"
00:31:03.903,00:31:05.238,No.

00:33:57.702,00:34:00.913,"Um... Sure! Yeah! You know, but first let's..."
00:34:02.832,00:34:05.168,It's a traditional Freedonian dance.
00:34:05.293,00:34:07.045,How amazing does that look?
00:34:09.797,00:34:12.091,Cheese! I love this.
00:34:13.051,00:34:15.887,The little girls go and get the cheese from the little boys.
00:34:15.970,00:34:17.513,That's adorable!
00:34:20.058,00:34:23.895,"Aw, look at that poor little guy. With his little boots."
00:34:24.270,00:34:25.938,Nobody picked him.
00:34:26.481,00:34:28.566,"Oh, Margo, why don't you go up there?"
00:34:28.649,00:34:29.817,No way!

00:34:36.199,00:34:38.201,-Right now! -What?
00:34:38.284,00:34:40.286,"I'm being tougher, you know? Like you said."
00:34:40.369,00:34:43.539,No! I meant be tougher on them. Not me!
00:34:43.623,00:34:46.584,"Oh, come on, just do it. What's the worst that could happen?"
00:34:47.085,00:34:48.211,Mmm...
00:34:49.253,00:34:50.671,Fine.
00:34:55.093,00:34:56.761,Wow!

00:35:00.515,00:35:02.058,"Hello, Margo!"
00:35:02.141,00:35:03.851,I am Niko.
00:35:03.935,00:35:06.062,Would you like some of my cheese?
00:35:07.396,00:35:08.481,Mmm...
00:35:16.364,00:35:19.450,"Did you see that, girls? I laid down the..."
00:35:20.201,00:35:22.036,"Oh, no! Where are they?"
00:35:22.578,00:35:24.872,Oh... Agnes? Edith?
00:35:36.884,00:35:39.595,My little brain is going to explode!
00:35:43.850,00:35:45.309,"It's real, all right."
00:35:46.477,00:35:49.522,That horn came from the Crooked Forest.
00:35:49.689,00:35:54.694,The only place on earth where unicorns still live.
00:36:04.120,00:36:06.038,They all think I'm crazy.
00:36:06.247,00:36:09.125,"But I'm telling you, I saw one once."
00:36:09.417,00:36:11.460,With my own eye.
00:36:11.544,00:36:14.964,"Wait, wait, wait. You saw a for-real live unicorn?"
00:36:16.507,00:36:18.342,Did you pet it? Did it smell like candy?
00:36:18.467,00:36:21.429,Was it fluffy?
00:36:21.512,00:36:29.020,"It was so fluffy, Mmm! Do you think maybe I could find one, too?"
00:36:29.520,00:36:38.446,"Oh! They say if a maiden pure of heart goes into the Crooked Forest, the unicorn will come and be hers."
00:36:38.654,00:36:39.864,Forever.
00:36:40.656,00:36:41.949,Hmm...
00:36:53.920,00:36:54.795,Goal!
00:36:58.049,00:36:59.467,"Girls, don't worry. I'm here."
00:37:02.094,00:37:03.638,"Yeah, we're fine."
00:37:03.721,00:37:05.264,Are you?
00:37:05.348,00:37:06.807,Unicorns are really real!
00:37:11.229,00:37:14.190,Sorry. Went a little mama bear on ya.
00:37:14.273,00:37:16.067,"You know, I heard a scream and..."
00:37:22.198,00:37:23.699,Wait for me here.
00:37:32.166,00:37:34.335,-Did you just steal candies? -Yes!
00:37:34.502,00:37:36.837,That's a lot of effort for two lollipops.
00:37:42.551,00:37:44.220,"Oh, no! The police!"
00:37:44.303,00:37:45.846,What do we do? What do we do?
00:37:46.305,00:37:48.808,Come on! This is gonna be fun!
00:38:01.612,00:38:02.613,Pigs!
00:38:26.971,00:38:28.139,All right!
00:38:48.409,00:38:51.287,"Oh, man, that was crazy!"
00:38:51.370,00:38:52.955,We were so close to getting busted.
00:38:53.039,00:38:54.081,Tell me about it.
00:38:54.165,00:38:56.208,I thought you were going to pee your pants.
00:39:27.365,00:39:29.200,Hey! What are you doing?
00:39:29.658,00:39:31.494,Intruders! Intruders!
00:39:39.210,00:39:40.419,"Hey, you, don't move!"
00:39:40.503,00:39:41.504,Halt!
00:39:47.385,00:39:49.011,Call for backup!
00:40:01.899,00:40:03.109,"Ooh, uh..."
00:40:51.907,00:40:52.950,Get 'em! Go! Go!
00:41:43.959,00:41:47.046,"Face it, Gru. Villainy is in your blood."
00:41:47.713,00:41:50.549,You can't tell me you don't miss the rush. A little?
00:41:51.091,00:41:52.051,Uh...
00:41:53.928,00:41:56.680,And now you've got the chance to get back on top.
00:41:56.764,00:41:57.890,Get your mojo back.
00:41:57.973,00:42:01.852,Become Gru again. How awesome would that be?
00:42:03.979,00:42:07.733,"Oh, please, come on. Just one heist."
00:42:08.359,00:42:20.329,"There's got to be something out there, somewhere There is something."
00:42:23.582,00:42:26.961,the largest diamond in the world?
00:42:27.044,00:42:29.255,Yes! I love it!
00:42:31.757,00:42:34.218,Thank you from the bottoms of my heart.
00:42:36.887,00:42:39.765,"Oh, you know what? We should do something to celebrate!"
00:42:41.767,00:42:43.811,I've got the perfect idea.
00:42:47.147,00:42:50.359,"Fritz, my good fellow, could you get me another napkin, please?"
00:42:50.442,00:42:52.611,"Ah, yes. Of course, Miss Edith."
00:42:59.493,00:43:01.036,"Hey, where are Gru and Dru?"
00:43:01.120,00:43:03.163,Here we are!
00:43:03.247,00:43:05.291,"Oh, how's it going?"
00:43:06.709,00:43:08.335,It's me! Gru.
00:43:08.544,00:43:10.212,"And me, Dru."
00:43:11.088,00:43:15.050,I hug everybody whether they like it or not.
00:43:15.134,00:43:17.553,Why are they pretending to be each other?
00:43:19.138,00:43:22.766,Ah! What's for dinner? I probably won't like it.
00:43:22.850,00:43:26.437,I'm so Grumpy all the time. Hmm.
00:43:26.520,00:43:30.274,I laugh a lot. And I'm kind of an idiot!
00:43:40.534,00:43:42.411,"Oh, I'm busting a gut!"
00:43:42.494,00:43:45.956,Look at them! They had no idea!
00:43:48.042,00:43:50.210,"Oh, look, it's me, Gru!"
00:43:50.294,00:43:53.213,And I'm Dru! We switched places!
00:43:53.297,00:43:55.966,"Oh, it's so nice to see you two are getting along."
00:43:56.050,00:43:58.927,"-Oh, we're getting... -Along perfectly."
00:43:59.553,00:44:01.055,-Wait. Did we... -Just finish...
00:44:01.138,00:44:02.222,-Each... -Other's...
00:44:02.306,00:44:03.599,-Sentences? -Sentences?
00:44:05.059,00:44:07.227,"Oh, that's delightful. Not creepy at all."
00:44:07.311,00:44:08.854,"And you're gonna stop now though, right?"
00:44:08.937,00:44:10.773,"Sorry, it's a twin thing."
00:44:10.856,00:44:12.274,Uh-huh...
00:44:12.358,00:44:15.611,"So, uh, what did you guys do today?"
00:44:18.280,00:44:19.698,Okay. What does it...
00:44:21.700,00:44:24.244,"Pardon me! Out of the way! Good night, everybody!"
00:44:24.328,00:44:26.914,Hey! Hey! Put the brakes on. What's the rush?
00:44:26.997,00:44:29.708,I need to get to bed so I can wake up and find a unicorn!
00:44:29.792,00:44:30.959,Good night!
00:44:32.920,00:44:34.296,What was that about?
00:44:34.380,00:44:38.217,Agnes thinks she's gonna find a real unicorn in the woods tomorrow.
00:44:42.721,00:44:43.847,Not it!
00:44:44.390,00:44:48.435,"Oh, don't worry. Parenting 101. I got this."
00:44:51.688,00:44:56.693,"And please bless that when I find the unicorn he'll want to come home with me, and sleep in my room."
00:44:56.777,00:44:59.613,And that I can ride him to school every day.
00:45:00.447,00:45:03.492,And he'll use his magical powers to help me do math.
00:45:03.951,00:45:05.035,Amen.
00:45:07.788,00:45:09.164,"Oh, hi, Gru."
00:45:10.165,00:45:14.044,"Hey. So, big day tomorrow."
00:45:14.128,00:45:17.965,"Yeah, I'm finally gonna get to see a unicorn. For reals."
00:45:21.760,00:45:24.221,"Oh, yeah. Sure."
00:45:24.304,00:45:28.600,"Tell you what, every unicorn you find, you can bring it home."
00:45:28.809,00:45:31.353,"I'd better build a big pen, right?"
00:45:32.438,00:45:38.152,"But, you know, there's a chance that you might not find one."
00:45:39.278,00:45:40.279,Huh?
00:45:42.406,00:45:46.410,It might not be good unicorn-finding weather.
00:45:48.787,00:45:52.374,Um... They're tricky to find them.
00:45:52.749,00:45:56.587,And I don't know. Maybe...
00:45:56.670,00:46:16.982,Maybe unicorns don't really But the man said a maiden could find one if she was pure in heart.
00:46:17.191,00:46:19.776,"And I'm pure in heart, right?"
00:46:20.819,00:46:22.070,The purest.
00:46:26.617,00:46:29.995,Can we stop talking now? I need to get to sleep.
00:46:30.204,00:46:31.413,"Good night, sweetie."
00:46:31.830,00:46:33.081,"Good night, Gru."
00:46:43.884,00:46:45.260,I'm okay.
00:46:53.894,00:46:55.812,Hey! Give that back!
00:47:00.526,00:47:01.902,"Oh, no! Run!"
00:47:27.678,00:47:30.681,We've been waiting a long time. Can we...
00:47:35.310,00:47:36.728,Gru?
00:47:37.896,00:47:38.772,Uh-oh!
00:47:51.368,00:47:52.411,Ha!
00:48:49.468,00:48:51.386,"What's today's plan, boss?"
00:48:54.181,00:48:55.515,I'll show you the plan!
00:48:55.599,00:49:02.022,Time to watch a very special episode of Evil Bratt to see exactly what I'm gonna do to stupid Tinseltown.
00:49:08.487,00:49:11.490,It's a giant Evil Bratt robot!
00:49:11.573,00:49:12.824,Open fire!
00:49:12.908,00:49:13.867,I have him in my sights!
00:49:18.246,00:49:20.916,"Nice try, coppers! Chew on this!"
00:49:24.378,00:49:27.714,"He's shooting his super sticky, self-inflating gum!"
00:49:30.759,00:49:32.761,"Gum one, gum all!"
00:49:36.682,00:49:39.518,"Seriously, how did this show never win an Emmy?"
00:49:42.437,00:49:46.233,"And now, it's your turn to shine, my diamond!"
00:49:58.453,00:50:03.291,"Hey, Clive. I guess you could say our plan was out of this world!"
00:50:07.504,00:50:09.756,"Now, that's entertainment!"
00:50:10.048,00:50:12.092,Come on! Let's make it a reality!
00:50:16.138,00:50:21.560,"Here we are, in the dark and creepy Crooked Forest in search of the mythical unicorn."
00:50:21.768,00:50:23.061,For some reason.
00:50:23.270,00:50:26.523,And here she is! The fearless unicorn hunter seeking...
00:50:26.732,00:50:28.108,"Edith, stop it!"
00:50:28.191,00:50:30.444,You're gonna scare away the unicorn.
00:50:30.569,00:50:34.865,"If, somehow, we actually find a unicorn, I'm gonna film it and get rich."
00:50:39.119,00:50:40.120,This is it!
00:50:40.203,00:50:41.705,This is where we're gonna see it.
00:50:45.792,00:50:46.793,What's that for?
00:50:46.877,00:50:48.670,Bait! Duh.
00:50:52.048,00:50:54.050,"Now, all we have to do is wait."
00:50:58.597,00:51:05.187,"Okay, this is Bratt's lair. It may not look like much, but this place is armed with some of the most high-tech weaponry known to man."
00:51:05.312,00:51:07.606,It's considered impenetrable.
00:51:07.731,00:51:10.650,"But a piece of cake for us, right, brother?"
00:51:10.734,00:51:14.362,Yes. This is not like stealing lollipops.
00:51:16.281,00:51:17.699,Whoa!
00:51:19.618,00:51:23.872,His security system can detect an air assault from any direction.
00:51:29.294,00:51:31.588,"Please, stop! Ouch!"
00:51:33.089,00:51:36.510,So we'll have to approach low and close to the water.
00:51:36.635,00:51:39.262,Next. Ah...
00:51:39.429,00:51:41.765,Then there are these deadly spikes.
00:51:48.605,00:51:49.606,Literally.
00:51:51.733,00:51:52.901,"Ah, good to know."
00:51:52.984,00:51:56.780,So here's the plan. You're the getaway driver.
00:51:59.074,00:52:01.409,"Wait, hold on! Wait in the boat?"
00:52:05.330,00:52:09.292,"Dru, the getaway driver is the most crucial part of any plan."
00:52:09.376,00:52:18.802,"Do you know how hard it is doing nothing, touching nothing when all of that adrenaline is coursing through your veins and you must wait?"
00:52:18.885,00:52:20.262,Can I count on you?
00:52:20.804,00:52:21.763,Yeah.
00:52:22.097,00:52:23.640,"Ah, I guess so."
00:52:23.723,00:52:27.310,"So, I'll climb up to the cube and enter here."
00:52:27.394,00:52:30.146,"Then once I'm inside, find the diamond."
00:52:30.230,00:52:34.234,I've underestimated Bratt before. It's not going to be easy.
00:52:34.317,00:52:36.278,I think we can handle it.
00:52:39.030,00:52:42.492,Dad's villain suits! This will make us unstoppable!
00:52:43.034,00:52:44.661,"Whoa! Ay, chihuahua!"
00:52:45.203,00:52:46.913,I call the black one.
00:52:49.249,00:52:51.418,It's go time!
00:53:02.137,00:53:03.221,Hello.
00:53:03.305,00:53:04.347,"Oh, hi!"
00:53:04.431,00:53:07.642,"Hello, mother of Margo. I am Niko."
00:53:07.767,00:53:17.777,"I present you with pig to confirm -What's going on? -Uh, remember little boots?"
00:53:18.320,00:53:21.114,"-Hello, my schmoopsie poo. -Whoa, hey!"
00:53:24.367,00:53:26.703,What? We're not engaged.
00:53:26.786,00:53:31.082,"Look, Niko, you seem like a very nice boy with a very nice pig."
00:53:31.625,00:53:33.376,Uh... But you're not engaged.
00:53:34.753,00:53:36.338,Okay? It's not happening.
00:53:37.047,00:53:38.506,I understand.
00:53:39.007,00:53:40.258,Who was I kidding?
00:53:40.342,00:53:43.637,A dumpling like me with a goddess like you.
00:53:44.137,00:53:47.807,"But I promise, I will never forget you, Margo."
00:53:48.391,00:53:49.768,Never.
00:53:51.311,00:53:53.897,"Oh, I'm pretty sure I won't forget you either."
00:53:53.980,00:53:55.607,"Bye. Bye, Niko."
00:53:58.777,00:54:00.987,That was totally humiliating.
00:54:01.196,00:54:04.115,Taking a bite of that cheese was the stupidest thing I've ever done.
00:54:04.324,00:54:05.784,Why did I listen to you?
00:54:05.867,00:54:07.285,"Right. But it's over now, so..."
00:54:11.581,00:54:15.126,You refuse my son's engagement pig?
00:54:15.210,00:54:16.086,What?
00:54:16.169,00:54:20.423,May you and your daughter die a slow death and be buried with onions.
00:54:23.218,00:54:24.594,"All right, lady, that's it!"
00:54:24.678,00:54:25.720,Nobody...
00:54:25.804,00:54:30.225,Nobody curses my daughter! Ya got that?
00:54:30.308,00:54:33.478,"Because if you mess with Margo, you mess with me!"
00:54:33.561,00:54:37.649,"And I promise, you do not wanna mess with me."
00:54:38.191,00:54:40.026,Do you understand me?
00:54:41.361,00:54:43.738,Good. Now get!
00:54:47.409,00:54:49.995,"Look, Margo, I think we just need to... Oh."
00:54:53.957,00:54:54.958,Yes!
00:55:15.186,00:55:17.939,Already? Just a couple more hours.
00:55:18.023,00:55:19.941,We have to be home before it gets dark.
00:55:23.319,00:55:25.655,I did exactly what the man said.
00:55:25.739,00:55:28.992,You mean that one-eyed scar-faced man that everybody laughed at?
00:55:29.075,00:55:31.286,"Yeah, it makes no sense."
00:55:31.494,00:55:32.954,"Look, Agnes, maybe we're not..."
00:55:44.716,00:55:48.261,"Ooh, my whole life has been building to this moment."
00:56:02.108,00:56:04.277,I'm gonna name you Lucky!
00:56:09.032,00:56:12.035,"Yeah, I'll let someone else burst her bubble."
00:56:18.541,00:56:22.045,Look at us! Two brothers pulling a heist!
00:56:22.253,00:56:27.509,"And that diamond will make us the richest, most powerful villains in the world!"
00:56:27.717,00:56:29.010,"Right, brother?"
00:56:29.094,00:56:33.056,"Oh, right. Yep, yeah."
00:56:35.308,00:56:38.311,Bravo! Bravissimo!
00:56:38.394,00:56:40.063,You're amazing! I'm so sorry.
00:56:40.146,00:56:41.648,I'm so embarrassed. I was very rude.
00:56:41.731,00:56:43.441,-And you were always such a gentleman. -You did it!
00:56:43.525,00:56:45.819,You did it! You got our jobs back!
00:56:54.536,00:56:56.121,"Oh, look. We're here!"
00:57:06.047,00:57:08.049,I still don't see why I can't go with you.
00:57:08.133,00:57:09.676,"Hey, hey! We discussed this."
00:57:09.759,00:57:12.262,Now is not the time to mess with the plan.
00:57:12.470,00:57:13.513,Fine.
00:57:26.025,00:57:27.026,Ha-ha!
00:57:28.945,00:57:31.906,"What? I told you, you are supposed to stay with the boat!"
00:57:31.990,00:57:34.951,"Oh, I didn't think you meant that literally."
00:57:35.034,00:57:36.578,What other way could I have meant it?
00:57:43.585,00:57:44.544,Whoa!
00:57:46.796,00:57:48.256,"Ow, ow, ow!"
00:57:48.339,00:57:50.592,"Oh, no! The poison spikes!"
00:57:50.925,00:57:52.051,I'm gonna be impaled!
00:57:59.434,00:58:00.602,Come on!
00:58:06.733,00:58:07.942,Coming.
00:58:14.157,00:58:15.158,Coming.
00:58:28.671,00:58:30.256,Quick! Camouflage mode.
00:58:33.301,00:58:34.636,And cover your mouth!
00:58:40.850,00:58:42.310,"Okay, take my hand."
00:59:05.875,00:59:08.503,Ha-ha! Follow me.
00:59:37.699,00:59:41.035,"Oh, you were right. I should have stayed in the boat."
00:59:41.119,00:59:43.871,My stomach feels all queasy.
00:59:43.955,00:59:46.708,I shouldn't have eaten that pot pie.
00:59:48.543,00:59:52.672,"Hey, hey, relax. You're gonna be just fine."
00:59:52.755,00:59:53.923,I got your back.
01:00:00.805,01:00:02.223,Come on. This way.
01:00:38.176,01:00:39.177,Huh?
01:00:42.764,01:00:43.765,Hmm?
01:01:55.586,01:01:57.755,"Yes, I'd like to thank the Academy..."
01:02:00.341,01:02:01.926,"-I can help. -No, no, no."
01:02:02.009,01:02:03.344,-What? I can do it. -Don't! Don't! Don't!
01:02:03.428,01:02:04.345,"Why, yes."
01:02:04.512,01:02:05.680,"Yes, Molly Ringwald, I will take you to the prom."
01:02:07.265,01:02:10.518,What? Who? Where? What? Who's there? Who is there?
01:02:20.987,01:02:22.363,Whoops! Almost forgot!
01:02:37.295,01:02:38.546,Stay close.
01:02:41.966,01:02:42.842,What?
01:02:43.384,01:02:44.719,Dolls.
01:02:44.802,01:02:48.723,Looks like Bratt was the only one stupid enough to buy this junk.
01:02:48.806,01:02:51.642,"Oh, I used to have one of these!"
01:02:56.939,01:02:58.816,-Ow! -Hey! Shh! Come on.
01:03:06.741,01:03:09.118,All right. We're getting close.
01:03:09.994,01:03:14.123,"From now on, every move must be made with total precision and purpose."
01:03:16.000,01:03:17.335,Gum!
01:03:18.586,01:03:21.714,"We're after the diamond, not the bubblegum."
01:03:21.798,01:03:22.799,Got it!
01:03:25.343,01:03:26.803,Mmm. Yum.
01:03:30.598,01:03:33.601,"And now, to put this where it belongs."
01:03:34.727,01:03:35.812,What...
01:03:45.446,01:03:47.532,Will you please shut up? He's gonna spot us!
01:03:57.124,01:03:59.710,Intruders! Intruders! Intruders!
01:04:04.423,01:04:06.801,Gru? There's two of you now?
01:04:16.936,01:04:18.479,Give me back my diamond!
01:04:19.981,01:04:22.358,"-Oh! -Go get 'em, Bratt Pack!"
01:04:31.075,01:04:33.286,They're gonna get us! They're gonna get us!
01:04:48.175,01:04:49.260,"Oh, no!"
01:04:51.304,01:04:53.764,Are we gonna die? Are we gonna die?
01:05:07.236,01:05:09.196,"Hey, guys. Hold on!"
01:05:09.739,01:05:10.865,Lucy!
01:05:17.955,01:05:21.000,Thank you for saving us. Whoo!
01:05:21.083,01:05:23.336,Look! We got the diamond and we're going to...
01:05:23.419,01:05:26.714,Take it to the AVL and get our jobs back.
01:05:27.965,01:05:29.759,"What? Oh, that's amazing!"
01:05:29.842,01:05:31.886,"And the best part is, you'll never..."
01:05:39.727,01:05:40.770,Lesson learned.
01:05:54.408,01:05:56.077,I'll get the girls and start packing.
01:05:56.160,01:05:57.203,And tell them the good news!
01:05:59.288,01:06:01.290,Yes! Yes! Go tell the girls.
01:06:02.500,01:06:03.376,Dru...
01:06:03.459,01:06:06.462,No! No way! We can't give the diamond back!
01:06:06.545,01:06:07.880,I have to.
01:06:07.964,01:06:10.091,"-No, you don't! -Yes, I do."
01:06:13.719,01:06:14.762,What is wrong with you?
01:06:14.845,01:06:15.930,What is wrong with you?
01:06:16.013,01:06:17.056,You kicked me!
01:06:17.181,01:06:18.432,You... You lied to me!
01:06:18.516,01:06:20.309,"Hey, I would have told you the truth."
01:06:20.393,01:06:23.104,But you're too much of a wimp to handle it.
01:06:23.187,01:06:24.563,That's it. I'm out of here.
01:06:25.106,01:06:27.858,You have no right to take that. We stole it together.
01:06:30.111,01:06:31.153,You got to be kidding me.
01:06:31.237,01:06:33.406,You did nothing but screw up the whole time.
01:06:33.489,01:06:34.865,I got this in spite of you.
01:06:34.949,01:06:40.579,"Oh, yeah? At least I didn't get fired from my job like a total loser."
01:06:40.663,01:06:42.331,At least I had a job.
01:06:42.415,01:06:44.333,What have you accomplished that was so great?
01:06:44.542,01:06:47.044,I'll tell you what. Nothing!
01:06:47.878,01:06:50.673,No wonder Dad thought you were such a failure.
01:06:53.217,01:06:54.969,We are no longer brothers.
01:06:55.052,01:06:57.013,That's fine with me.
01:07:39.472,01:07:42.641,Gru! I found a unicorn!
01:07:45.186,01:07:46.645,My life is complete!
01:07:49.356,01:07:50.941,"Honey, that's..."
01:07:51.025,01:07:53.819,That's not actually a unicorn.
01:07:54.361,01:07:55.237,Huh?
01:07:59.617,01:08:02.745,"I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie..."
01:08:05.790,01:08:08.793,Life is just like that sometimes.
01:08:08.876,01:08:12.838,"We're hoping for a unicorn, and we get a goat."
01:08:15.257,01:08:17.384,"Well, you know what?"
01:08:17.468,01:08:21.430,Lucky is the best goat in the whole wide world!
01:08:21.639,01:08:25.226,Look at that face! I just want to squeeze it.
01:08:30.106,01:08:31.857,I'll take this.
01:08:32.066,01:08:35.069,"You've been a bad boy, Gru."
01:08:35.194,01:08:36.529,Can you get the rest of the suitcases?
01:08:37.196,01:08:38.697,"Come on, girls. Let's go!"
01:08:49.834,01:08:51.418,"Change of plans, girls."
01:08:56.382,01:08:58.884,We're going to Hollywood!
01:09:00.678,01:09:03.222,"Now, that's what I call acting."
01:09:16.527,01:09:17.862,Bratt! He took the girls!
01:09:17.945,01:09:20.072,What? No!
01:09:23.075,01:09:24.451,Dru! Dru!
01:09:24.952,01:09:27.538,Go away! I don't wanna talk to you.
01:09:27.621,01:09:29.623,Bratt has the girls!
01:09:39.508,01:09:40.843,"No, I'm the one..."
01:09:40.926,01:09:42.303,But I shouldn't have...
01:09:42.553,01:09:44.221,I'm... I'm sorry.
01:09:45.639,01:09:47.892,"I'm so sorry, Gru."
01:09:48.434,01:09:49.602,Aw!
01:09:50.519,01:09:51.854,"Ooh, look out!"
01:10:01.780,01:10:02.823,Mel?
01:10:38.901,01:10:42.154,"Hello, Hollywood!"
01:10:47.201,01:10:48.661,I'm scared!
01:10:48.744,01:10:51.497,Thank you. Thank you so... Oh!
01:10:56.418,01:10:58.254,"No, you can't leave me here!"
01:10:58.462,01:10:59.838,I'm famous!
01:11:05.844,01:11:07.680,Chew on this!
01:11:24.697,01:11:27.283,"Hey, mullet head! Let us out!"
01:11:27.825,01:11:32.746,"Oh, don't worry, girls. I've prepared a front row seat for you."
01:11:55.894,01:11:57.521,"Enjoy the show, girls."
01:12:05.487,01:12:06.780,-What in the heck? -Oh!
01:12:07.448,01:12:09.033,I hope the girls are okay.
01:12:09.241,01:12:12.244,Bratt! Bratt at nine o'clock... No! Three o'clock!
01:12:12.328,01:12:13.620,He's on the left!
01:12:18.625,01:12:21.545,He's going to bubblegum the whole city and send it up into space!
01:12:33.807,01:12:36.226,Oh! This is it! This is it!
01:12:36.310,01:12:38.437,Lights! Camera!
01:12:38.520,01:12:39.772,Laser!
01:12:50.324,01:12:51.658,Yeah!
01:12:58.791,01:13:01.126,"I've got the girls. You two, go take care of Bratt."
01:13:09.259,01:13:10.761,"Look, you guys, it's Lucy!"
01:13:10.844,01:13:13.055,"Lucy, over here! Help! Help us!"
01:13:13.138,01:13:14.973,"Mama's comin', girls."
01:13:19.019,01:13:21.313,I love it when a plan comes together.
01:13:26.318,01:13:27.403,"Get ready, Bratt."
01:13:27.486,01:13:30.614,You're about to be blasted back to the '80s!
01:13:53.720,01:13:55.180,"-Oh, no! -Don't worry."
01:13:55.264,01:13:56.890,There's more where that came from.
01:13:56.974,01:13:59.726,It'll take more than that to stop me.
01:14:10.362,01:14:12.114,"Oh, incoming!"
01:14:15.242,01:14:16.326,You little...
01:14:24.001,01:14:25.127,"Quick, jump!"
01:14:28.005,01:14:29.173,Bonus!
01:14:32.092,01:14:33.719,"Buh-bye, Wonder Twins."
01:15:04.791,01:15:06.001,Hang on!
01:15:13.800,01:15:16.094,"Hang on, girls! I've got you!"
01:15:26.939,01:15:28.357,"Thank you, Lucy!"
01:15:28.440,01:15:30.651,Let's go! We're not safe yet.
01:16:11.275,01:16:13.777,"Oh, no! No, no, no!"
01:16:18.448,01:16:21.076,I've been a bad boy!
01:16:29.126,01:16:32.588,Nobody messes with my brother!
01:16:44.141,01:16:46.101,What? What's happening? No!
01:16:59.114,01:17:00.115,Dru!
01:17:01.658,01:17:02.909,Hold on! I'm coming.
01:17:07.748,01:17:10.167,You've ruined everything!
01:17:10.375,01:17:12.586,"And now, it's time to die."
01:17:12.753,01:17:14.796,"Any last words, Gru?"
01:17:15.672,01:17:17.257,You know what?
01:17:17.341,01:17:19.593,I got two words for you.
01:17:20.594,01:17:21.720,Dance fight.
01:17:22.929,01:17:26.183,"Oh, it is on like Donkey Kong."
01:17:26.850,01:17:29.519,I am going to enjoy this.
01:18:12.062,01:18:13.480,Uh-oh.
01:18:21.029,01:18:23.824,Is this what you're looking for?
01:18:24.366,01:18:25.242,No!
01:18:35.502,01:18:36.878,No!
01:18:43.844,01:18:45.345,Curse you!
01:18:54.479,01:18:56.690,Dru? Dru?
01:19:04.448,01:19:06.366,Hey! We did it!
01:19:06.783,01:19:08.785,"Yes, we did, brother."
01:19:26.219,01:19:27.262,Gru!
01:19:27.345,01:19:29.681,"Hey, Mel. Welcome back."
01:20:00.003,01:20:01.004,Mmm.
01:20:02.881,01:20:04.382,"Love you, Mom."
01:20:28.281,01:20:30.575,"Boys, time for bed!"
01:20:30.784,01:20:32.369,We're back at work in the morning.
01:20:34.538,01:20:35.789,"Good night, Lucy."
01:20:35.872,01:20:37.749,"See you tomorrow, brother."
01:20:37.833,01:20:39.376,"Hey, I'm back on the job."
01:20:39.459,01:20:42.003,"So no villainy tonight, huh? Got it?"
01:20:42.546,01:20:45.340,I make no promises. Love you!
01:20:45.715,01:20:47.717,Uh-huh. Right.
01:20:51.221,01:20:55.100,"Aw! All right, every... Go! Go! Go to bed!"
01:21:25.088,01:21:28.258,Hey! I thought we said no more villainy!
01:21:28.341,01:21:29.634,"Sorry, brother!"
01:21:29.718,01:21:33.805,"Somebody's gotta keep the family tradition alive, right?"
01:21:43.607,01:21:45.650,-Let's get him. -Ugh.
01:21:45.734,01:21:47.903,"Honey, he's my brother."
01:21:47.986,01:21:49.946,We'll give him a five-minute head start.
