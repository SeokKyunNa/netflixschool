00:00:25.083,00:00:27.291,"WHEN YOU HEAR IT, YOU'RE GONNA THINK WE'RE INSANE."
00:00:27.333,00:00:30.291,Ed: TRY US.
00:00:32.208,00:00:37.083,"Debbie: IT STARTED OUT SMALL, LIKE A HAND OR A LEG WAS IN A DIFFERENT POSITION."
00:00:37.125,00:00:39.959,THEN ITS HEAD WAS LOOKING UP INSTEAD OF DOWN.
00:00:40.000,00:00:43.166,"AND THEN ONE DAY, IT WAS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ROOM."
00:00:43.208,00:00:44.291,IT WAS MOVING AROUND BY ITSELF.
00:00:44.333,00:00:49.250,Ed: EVER THINK THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY HAD A KEY TO YOUR APARTMENT AND WAS JUST PLAYING A TRICK ON YA?
00:00:49.291,00:00:51.083,Debbie: THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE THOUGHT.
00:00:51.125,00:00:54.792,BUT NEVER ONCE DID WE FIND ANY SIGN OR EVIDENCE OF INTRUSION.
00:00:54.834,00:00:58.709,Lorraine: AND THIS ALL LED YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THE DOLL WAS POSSESSED?
00:00:58.750,00:01:00.166,CAMILLA GOT IN TOUCH WITH A MEDIUM.
00:01:00.208,00:01:05.542,WE LEARNED FROM HER THAT A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL NAMED ANNABELLE HIGGINS HAD DIED IN THIS APARTMENT.
00:01:05.583,00:01:09.458,SHE WAS LONELY AND TOOK A LIKING TO MY DOLL.
00:01:09.500,00:01:12.208,ALL SHE WANTED WAS TO BE FRIENDS.
00:01:12.250,00:01:15.083,"WHEN WE HEARD THIS, WE FELT REALLY SORRY FOR HER."
00:01:15.125,00:01:17.333,"I MEAN, WE'RE NURSES, WE HELP PEOPLE."
00:01:17.375,00:01:22.417,SO WE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO MOVE INTO THE DOLL.
00:01:22.458,00:01:25.291,"WAIT, YOU DID WHAT?"
00:01:25.333,00:01:27.500,SHE WANTED TO LIVE WITH US BY INHABITING THE DOLL.
00:01:27.542,00:01:28.792,WE SAID YES.
00:01:28.834,00:01:31.583,BUT THEN THINGS GOT WORSE.
00:01:49.750,00:01:52.792,"WHEN WE CAME HOME, SHE WAS SITTING IN THE HALLWAY."
00:01:52.834,00:01:55.792,BUT WE HAD LEFT HER IN THE SPARE ROOM.
00:02:33.208,00:02:35.333,DEBBIE!
00:03:50.250,00:03:52.250,Debbie: WE ARE BEYOND TERRIFIED.
00:03:52.291,00:03:54.834,WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON OR WHAT TO DO.
00:03:54.875,00:03:56.375,CAN YOU HELP US?
00:03:56.417,00:03:57.917,"YES, WE CAN."
00:03:57.959,00:04:03.417,"NOW, FIRSTLY, THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS ANNABELLE, AND THERE NEVER WAS."
00:04:03.458,00:04:04.542,Lorraine: GHOSTS DON'T POSSESS SUCH POWER.
00:04:04.583,00:04:08.500,I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS SOMETHING EXTREMELY MANIPULATIVE.
00:04:08.542,00:04:10.083,IT'S SOMETHING INHUMAN.
00:04:10.125,00:04:13.166,IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE ACKNOWLEDGING THIS DOLL.
00:04:13.208,00:04:15.625,"AND THROUGH THAT, THE INHUMAN SPIRIT TRICKED YOU."
00:04:15.667,00:04:18.959,YOU GAVE IT PERMISSION TO INFEST YOUR LIVES.
00:04:19.000,00:04:20.917,WHAT'S AN INHUMAN SPIRIT?
00:04:20.959,00:04:25.083,IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NEVER WALKED THE EARTH IN HUMAN FORM.
00:04:25.125,00:04:27.166,IT'S SOMETHING DEMONIC.
00:04:30.583,00:04:33.667,Debbie: SO THE DOLL WAS NEVER POSSESSED?
00:04:33.709,00:04:35.291,"NO, NO, IT WAS USED AS A CONDUIT."
00:04:35.333,00:04:37.875,IT WAS MOVED AROUND TO GIVE THE IMPRESSION OF POSSESSION.
00:04:37.917,00:04:41.667,"DEMONIC SPIRITS DON'T POSSESS THINGS, THEY POSSESS PEOPLE."
00:04:41.709,00:04:44.542,IT WANTED TO GET INSIDE OF YOU.
00:04:54.291,00:04:56.458,"Ed: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD, DREW."
00:04:56.500,00:04:58.041,YOU CAN SHUT IT DOWN NOW.
00:04:58.083,00:05:00.458,HIT THE LIGHTS.
00:05:02.709,00:05:07.792,SO WE GOT THE CHURCH TO SEND A PRIEST OVER TO PERFORM A BLESSING ON THE HOUSE AND THE OCCUPANTS.
00:05:07.834,00:05:11.625,WHATEVER WAS OPPRESSING THAT APARTMENT WAS NO LONGER WITH THEM.
00:05:13.625,00:05:14.875,YES.
00:05:14.917,00:05:16.667,WHERE'S THE DOLL NOW??
00:05:16.709,00:05:19.041,SOMEPLACE SAFE.
00:05:19.834,00:05:20.834,YEP.
00:05:20.875,00:05:22.125,"SO, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS?"
00:05:22.166,00:05:24.041,"I MEAN, WHAT DO PEOPLE CALL YOU?"
00:05:24.083,00:05:28.500,"UH, WELL, WE'VE BEEN CALLED DEMONOLOGISTS."
00:05:28.542,00:05:29.792,THAT'S ONE NAME FOR US.
00:05:29.834,00:05:31.709,"GHOST HUNTERS, PARANORMAL RESEARCHERS."
00:05:31.750,00:05:33.291,KOOKS.
00:05:34.333,00:05:36.166,WACKOS.
00:05:36.208,00:05:39.709,BUT WE PREFER TO BE KNOWN SIMPLY AS ED AND LORRAINE WARREN.
00:06:41.250,00:06:42.750,Roger: HERE WE ARE.
00:06:45.834,00:06:47.542,"WOW, HEAR THAT?"
00:06:47.583,00:06:49.041,I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
00:06:49.083,00:06:51.250,EXACTLY.
00:06:51.291,00:06:54.709,OKAY.
00:06:54.750,00:06:56.625,"OH, GOD, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE."
00:06:56.667,00:06:58.583,ARE YOU SO EXCITED?
00:06:58.625,00:07:00.166,WHERE'S MY YES?
00:07:00.208,00:07:02.709,I'LL RACE YA!
00:07:02.750,00:07:04.458,I'M SO EXCITED!
00:07:04.500,00:07:07.875,"April: COME ON, SADIE!"
00:07:07.917,00:07:10.125,Nancy: ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
00:07:10.166,00:07:11.583,WHAT?!
00:07:11.625,00:07:13.083,SO DO I GET TO PICK MY OWN ROOM?
00:07:13.125,00:07:14.875,OR DO I HAVE NO CHOICE IN THAT EITHER?
00:07:17.709,00:07:21.250,"WELL, FIRST CUTE BOY SHE MEETS, SHE'LL FORGET ABOUT JERSEY."
00:07:21.291,00:07:23.250,"AH, GREAT."
00:07:23.291,00:07:24.417,CAN'T WAIT.
00:07:24.458,00:07:25.583,"COME ON, SADIE."
00:07:26.750,00:07:27.875,"SADIE, LET'S GO."
00:07:29.166,00:07:32.333,"HEY, COME."
00:07:32.375,00:07:34.000,WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
00:07:34.041,00:07:36.333,"HEY, COME ON, GIRL."
00:07:36.375,00:07:38.917,"ALL RIGHT, SUIT YOURSELF."
00:07:52.333,00:07:53.875,WATCH YOUR STEP.
00:07:55.208,00:07:56.250,"WHOA, WATCH OUT, DAD."
00:07:56.291,00:07:57.375,Man: WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?
00:07:57.417,00:07:58.583,THAT GOES IN THE LIVING ROOM.
00:07:58.625,00:08:00.083,"HEY, ANDREA, WHERE'S MY WIND CHIME?"
00:08:00.125,00:08:01.709,I THINK NANCY'S GOT IT IN THE OTHER ROOM.
00:08:01.750,00:08:03.709,"OH, THANKS. HEY, NANCY, HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIND CHIME?"
00:08:03.750,00:08:04.834,"OH, THIS ONE?"
00:08:04.875,00:08:06.000,YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CATCH IT.
00:08:06.041,00:08:07.542,NANCY! LET GO!
00:08:09.333,00:08:10.500,YOU'RE SO MEAN.
00:08:11.917,00:08:13.625,"HEY, MOM, CAN I HANG UP MY WIND CHIME?"
00:08:13.667,00:08:15.834,OF COURSE. THERE'S A LINE OUTSIDE YOU CAN HANG IT ON.
00:08:15.875,00:08:17.583,"HONEY, HAVE APRIL COME IN, OKAY?"
00:08:17.625,00:08:19.250,IT'S GONNA BE DARK SOON.
00:08:29.125,00:08:32.125,"COME ON, APRIL!"
00:08:32.166,00:08:35.125,"LOOK WHAT I FOUND, CINDY."
00:08:54.834,00:08:56.083,Nancy and Cindy: ONE...
00:08:56.125,00:08:57.834,TWO...
00:08:57.875,00:08:59.959,THREE.
00:09:00.000,00:09:02.625,NO PEEKING!
00:09:02.667,00:09:04.208,ARE YOU GUYS DONE WITH THE PIZZA?
00:09:04.250,00:09:05.959,I DON'T WANT IT GOING TO WASTE.
00:09:06.000,00:09:08.500,IT'S EXPENSIVE FEEDING YOU GIRLS.
00:09:08.542,00:09:12.166,"...SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN."
00:09:12.208,00:09:13.333,WHERE SHOULD I HIDE?
00:09:13.375,00:09:17.041,"READY OR NOT, HERE I COME!"
00:09:17.083,00:09:18.500,"OKAY, CLAP."
00:09:26.875,00:09:28.125,WHOA! WHOA!
00:09:28.166,00:09:29.583,"GUYS, YOU DON'T KNOW THE HOUSE WELL ENOUGH."
00:09:29.625,00:09:31.000,SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT.
00:09:31.041,00:09:32.125,"I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY."
00:09:32.166,00:09:34.917,SECOND CLAP.
00:09:40.667,00:09:42.500,THAT'S CHEATING.
00:09:54.208,00:09:57.750,CLAP.
00:09:58.875,00:10:00.208,GOT YOU!
00:10:01.417,00:10:03.375,ARE YOU OKAY?
00:10:03.417,00:10:05.166,"ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID WE BREAK NOW?"
00:10:05.208,00:10:06.166,I-I-I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
00:10:06.208,00:10:07.417,"MOVE OUT THERE, PLEASE."
00:10:07.458,00:10:10.417,IT WAS CHRISTINE'S FAULT.
00:10:10.458,00:10:11.542,Christine: MY FAULT?
00:10:11.583,00:10:13.458,Nancy: CHRISTINE DID IT.
00:10:13.500,00:10:14.875,"Christine: NO, I DIDN'T, YOU DID."
00:10:14.917,00:10:16.500,"NO, NO, YOU FELL BACK."
00:10:16.542,00:10:19.542,"HEY, NANCY, CAN YOU GO GET ME THE MATCHES, PLEASE?"
00:10:19.583,00:10:21.125,WHAT'S GOING ON?
00:10:21.166,00:10:22.959,SHUT UP.
00:10:23.000,00:10:24.625,WHAT BROKE?
00:10:24.667,00:10:25.917,WHOA.
00:10:25.959,00:10:28.959,I THINK WE HAVE A CELLAR OR SOMETHING.
00:10:29.000,00:10:30.417,"I WANNA SEE, I WANNA SEE."
00:10:30.458,00:10:31.750,OKAY.
00:10:31.792,00:10:35.458,"HERE, MATCHES."
00:10:35.500,00:10:36.667,"MOM, I WANNA SEE."
00:10:36.709,00:10:38.000,Nancy: I WANNA SEE TOO.

00:11:00.834,00:11:03.792,WHAT DO YOU SEE DOWN THERE?
00:11:03.834,00:11:06.667,"JUST, UH, HARD TO TELL, YOU KNOW?"
00:11:06.709,00:11:11.458,IT'S -- IT'S AN OLD PIANO AND A WHOLE BUNCH OF GARBAGE.
00:11:13.417,00:11:20.834,AH! SON OF A-- WOW.
00:11:25.166,00:11:28.792,ROG?

00:11:34.625,00:11:36.125,I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU GIRLS GOING DOWN THERE.
00:11:36.166,00:11:37.291,THAT PLACE IS LOADED WITH SPIDERS.
00:11:37.333,00:11:38.291,EW!
00:11:38.333,00:11:39.750,JUST RELAX.
00:11:39.792,00:11:42.250,"Christine: STOP IT, NANCY."
00:11:42.291,00:11:43.917,WE'VE GOT EXTRA SQUARE FOOTAGE ANYWAY.
00:11:43.959,00:11:45.417,I'LL CHECK IT OUT IN THE MORNING.
00:11:45.458,00:11:46.875,I WONDER WHY IT WAS BOARDED UP.
00:11:46.917,00:11:48.458,I DON'T KNOW.
00:11:48.500,00:11:50.083,"OKAY, GUYS, SHOW'S OVER."

00:11:52.542,00:11:53.834,BUT I'M NOT TIRED.
00:11:57.709,00:11:59.333,"Roger: MAN, I'M FRIED."
00:11:59.375,00:12:01.875,Carolyn: SOMETHING'S UP WITH SADIE.
00:12:01.917,00:12:04.166,"YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HER PROBLEM IS."
00:12:04.208,00:12:06.125,COULDN'T GET HER TO COME INSIDE.
00:12:06.166,00:12:07.959,WE CAN'T LEAVE HER OUT THERE.
00:12:08.000,00:12:11.500,SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
00:12:11.542,00:12:14.750,"SADIE, HEY, BE QUIET."
00:12:16.125,00:12:19.291,THANKS FOR MAKIN' THIS WORK.

00:12:22.250,00:12:24.417,"IT'S GONNA BE GREAT, ISN'T IT?"
00:12:24.458,00:12:26.917,I THINK IT'S GREAT ALREADY.
00:12:26.959,00:12:29.208,YEAH.

00:13:20.875,00:13:23.208,"IT IS CHILLY, ISN'T IT?"
00:13:23.250,00:13:26.625,DO YOU THINK MAYBE WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT A HOUSE THAT HAS A TOILET THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?
00:13:26.667,00:13:27.875,TELL YOUR FATHER.
00:13:27.917,00:13:30.417,AND THERE WAS THIS REALLY FUNKY SMELL IN MY BEDROOM LAST NIGHT.
00:13:30.458,00:13:31.667,REEKED LIKE SOMETHING DIED.

00:14:32.625,00:14:34.792,"WELL, WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO GO THROUGH IT, YOU KNOW?"
00:14:34.834,00:14:37.166,THERE MIGHT BE SOME ANTIQUES DOWN HERE WORTH A LOT OF MONEY.
00:14:37.208,00:14:39.500,"YEAH, OR JUST A LOT OF JUNK THE PREVIOUS OWNER DIDN'T WANT."
00:14:39.542,00:14:41.417,IT'S OURS NOW.
00:14:41.458,00:14:42.667,KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.
00:14:42.709,00:14:44.291,I'M GONNA MAKE SOME COFFEE.

00:14:47.500,00:14:49.834,"YEAH, THAT'D BE NICE."
00:15:03.542,00:15:07.125,April: SADIE!
00:15:07.166,00:15:10.792,MOMMY!
00:15:10.834,00:15:12.125,SHE'S OUTSIDE.
00:15:12.166,00:15:13.250,"YOU KNOW, I'M SURE SHE'S HUNGRY BY NOW."
00:15:13.291,00:15:14.667,WHY DON'T YOU GO AND GET HER.
00:15:16.083,00:15:17.250,OH!

00:15:19.458,00:15:20.834,SADIE!
00:15:20.875,00:15:23.000,ROGER.
00:15:23.041,00:15:25.667,"THIS CLOCK STOPPED AT 3:07, AND SO DID THE ONE IN THE HALLWAY."
00:15:25.709,00:15:26.959,THAT'S WEIRD.
00:15:29.291,00:15:31.208,MAYBE IT GOT KNOCKED AROUND IN THE MOVE.
00:15:31.250,00:15:34.250,"SPEAKING OF KNOCKED AROUND, WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME LAST NIGHT?"
00:15:34.291,00:15:36.125,OUCH.
00:15:36.166,00:15:37.333,DID I?
00:15:37.375,00:15:40.291,SADIE!
00:15:48.625,00:15:50.875,APRIL! APRIL!
00:15:50.917,00:15:52.375,APRIL!
00:15:52.417,00:15:54.250,APRIL!
00:15:54.291,00:15:55.792,WHAT HAPPENED?
00:15:55.834,00:15:58.000,"OH, MY GOD!"
00:16:01.625,00:16:03.125,ROGER.
00:16:08.834,00:16:10.750,Ed: WE KEEP EVERYTHING LOCKED IN HERE.
00:16:10.792,00:16:14.792,FEEL FREE TO LOOK AROUND.
00:16:17.583,00:16:20.333,WOW.
00:16:20.375,00:16:23.875,THIS IS CRAZY.
00:16:23.917,00:16:27.166,SO ALL THESE ARE TAKEN FROM CASES YOU'VE INVESTIGATED?
00:16:27.208,00:16:28.667,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:16:28.709,00:16:34.125,"EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN HERE IS EITHER HAUNTED, CURSED, OR HAS BEEN USED IN SOME KIND OF RITUALISTIC PRACTICE."
00:16:34.166,00:16:36.458,NOTHING'S A TOY.
00:16:36.500,00:16:38.250,NOT EVEN THE TOY MONKEY.
00:16:39.500,00:16:40.542,DON'T TOUCH IT.
00:16:43.375,00:16:45.041,WELL...
00:16:45.083,00:16:50.333,"WELL, ISN'T IT SCARY, OR DOESN'T IT WORRY YOU TO HAVE ALL THESE ITEMS RIGHT IN YOUR HOME?"
00:16:50.375,00:16:53.667,THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A PRIEST THAT COMES BY ONCE A MONTH TO BLESS THE ROOM.
00:16:53.709,00:16:58.208,"WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT IS: IT'S SAFER FOR THESE THINGS TO BE IN HERE THAN OUT THERE."
00:16:58.250,00:17:00.208,IT'S KIND OF LIKE KEEPIN' GUNS OFF THE STREET.
00:17:00.250,00:17:02.333,"WELL, WHY NOT JUST THROW 'EM IN AN INCINERATOR?"
00:17:02.375,00:17:03.709,DESTROY 'EM.
00:17:03.750,00:17:05.291,"WELL, THAT WOULD ONLY DESTROY THE VESSEL."
00:17:05.333,00:17:08.667,SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO KEEP THE GENIE IN THE BOTTLE.
00:17:08.709,00:17:12.709,"SAY, IS THE ANNABELLE DOLL HERE?"
00:17:12.750,00:17:15.542,RIGHT THIS WAY.
00:17:18.333,00:17:19.417,YEAH.
00:17:28.250,00:17:29.792,YOU SAID SHE'S A CONDUIT?
00:17:29.834,00:17:31.750,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:17:31.792,00:17:36.125,A VERY POWERFUL DEMONIC HAS LATCHED ITSELF ONTO HER.
00:17:36.166,00:17:41.625,"SO WHEN YOU GUYS INVESTIGATE THESE HAUNTINGS, HOW DO YOU STOP 'EM FROM LATCHIN' ONTO YOU?"
00:17:41.667,00:17:43.583,WE HAVE TO TAKE GREAT PRECAUTION.
00:17:43.625,00:17:44.959,BUT WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?
00:17:45.000,00:17:48.375,WHAT ABOUT HER?
00:17:48.417,00:17:51.959,"WELL, FATHER GORDON TOLD ME THAT-- WELL, THAT WAS DIFFERENT."
00:17:52.000,00:17:54.542,WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE HAPPENED DURING AN EXORCISM.
00:17:54.583,00:17:56.083,"WELL, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?"
00:17:58.875,00:18:01.208,'SCUSE ME.
00:18:01.250,00:18:03.250,"HONEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?"

00:18:16.208,00:18:18.000,"OH, SURE."
00:18:16.208,00:18:19.834,"YOU CAN'T GO INTO THIS ROOM, NO MATTER WHAT, REMEMBER?"
00:18:19.875,00:18:21.125,ALL RIGHT.
00:18:21.166,00:18:22.583,GO ON.
00:18:22.625,00:18:24.750,"LET'S SEE IF I CAN FIND YOU A LITTLE SNACK, OKAY?"

00:18:41.250,00:18:42.417,I'M WEARING IT TO DINNER.
00:18:42.458,00:18:44.458,"NO, YOU'RE NOT!"

00:18:51.208,00:18:53.625,"OOH, A NON-SKEPTIC."
00:18:53.667,00:18:55.125,THAT'S A PLEASANT CHANGE.

00:22:54.792,00:22:57.250,"ANDREA, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' OUTTA BED?"
00:22:57.291,00:22:58.500,WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
00:22:58.542,00:23:01.291,IT'S CINDY.
00:23:01.333,00:23:03.500,SHE'S SLEEPWALKING AGAIN.
00:23:17.458,00:23:20.583,I'VE NEVER SEEN HER DO THIS BEFORE.
00:23:24.583,00:23:26.709,I REMEMBERED YOU SAYING NOT TO WAKE HER IF SHE'S LIKE THIS.

00:34:34.834,00:34:37.625,YOU SAID THAT GOD BROUGHT US TOGETHER FOR A REASON.
00:34:37.667,00:34:39.208,RIGHT?
00:34:39.250,00:34:42.875,I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT TO WRITE A BOOK.
00:34:42.917,00:34:45.750,I'M GONNA GET DRESSED.
00:34:49.542,00:34:51.417,WE'VE ISOLATED THE DISTURBANCES TO THE ATTIC.
00:34:51.458,00:34:53.291,"NOW, I JUST WANT YOU TO LISTEN FOR A SECOND."
00:34:54.709,00:34:57.208,THAT'S IT.
00:34:57.250,00:34:59.333,"DO IT AGAIN, ED."
00:35:00.500,00:35:02.333,RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST MY WEIGHT.
00:35:02.375,00:35:08.667,"BUT YOU TAKE THE WATER COMIN' OFF-A THE PIPE COMBINED WITH THE WIND COMIN' THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOW, THESE BOARDS ARE GONNA EXPAND AND RUB AGAINST EACH OTHER."
00:35:08.709,00:35:13.125,YOU HEARD IT ALL THROUGH THE HOUSE 'CAUSE OF THESE PIPES LEADING TO THE RADIATOR.
00:35:13.166,00:35:15.709,SO THIS PLACE ISN'T HAUNTED?
00:35:15.750,00:35:17.083,"NO, IT RARELY IS."
00:35:17.125,00:35:22.083,"YEAH, THERE'S USUALLY ALWAYS SOME KIND OF RATIONAL EXPLANATION."
00:36:03.542,00:36:05.959,"GIRLS, IT'S WAY PAST YOUR BEDTIME."
00:38:02.959,00:38:04.417,WHO IS THAT?!
00:39:06.834,00:39:09.500,"WHO'S EVER DOWN THERE, I'M GONNA LOCK YOU IN NOW!"

00:43:01.500,00:43:03.458,"HELP, DADDY!"
00:43:03.500,00:43:06.291,WHO'S IN HERE?
00:43:06.333,00:43:09.041,"WHAT'S WRONG, BABY?"
00:43:09.083,00:43:11.625,"SOMEBODY, GODDAMN IT, TELL ME WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?!"
00:43:15.375,00:43:22.500,Ed: FEAR IS DEFINED AS A FEELING OF AGITATION AND ANXIETY CAUSED BY THE PRESENCE OR IMMINENCE OF DANGER.
00:43:22.542,00:43:26.625,"WHETHER IT'S A GHOST, A SPIRIT OR AN ENTITY, THEY ALL FEED ON IT."
00:43:26.667,00:43:27.667,TAKE MAURICE HERE.
00:43:27.709,00:43:35.291,"HE'S A FRENCH-CANADIAN FARMER WHO HAD NOTHING MORE THAN A THIRD-GRADE EDUCATION, YET AFTER HE WAS POSSESSED, SPOKE SOME OF THE BEST LATIN I'D EVER HEARD."
00:43:35.333,00:43:36.792,SOMETIMES BACKWARDS.
00:43:36.834,00:43:40.667,"HE'D BEEN MOLESTED BY HIS FATHER, WHO HAD ALSO TORTURED HIM REPEATEDLY."
00:43:40.709,00:43:44.291,A DARK SPIRIT MADE ITS HOME IN THIS MAN.
00:43:44.333,00:43:50.041,"NOW, IF YOU LOOK INTO HIS EYES, YOU CAN SEE HIM TEARING BLOOD."
00:43:56.125,00:44:01.709,"AND LIKE THAT, AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS STARTED TO APPEAR FROM WITHIN HIS BODY."
00:44:05.291,00:44:07.375,"ALL RIGHT, DREW, YOU CAN HIT THE LIGHTS."
00:44:07.417,00:44:08.875,OH. OH.
00:44:08.917,00:44:10.583,Woman: DID YOU PERSONALLY PERFORM THE EXORCISM?
00:44:10.625,00:44:14.250,"NO, I'M NOT AUTHORIZED."
00:44:14.291,00:44:18.917,"SEE, AN EXORCISM CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS, NOT ONLY FOR THE VICTIM, BUT FOR ANYONE IN THE ROOM."
00:44:18.959,00:44:21.250,"SO, WHAT HAPPENED TO MAURICE?"
00:44:21.291,00:44:25.500,"WELL, HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE, BUT INSTEAD HE SHOT HER IN THE ARM AND THEN HE TURNED THE GUN ON HIMSELF."
00:44:25.542,00:44:33.083,MAURICE HAD A VERY TROUBLED LIFE WITH LITTLE TO LIVE FOR AND NOT EVEN AN EXORCIST COULD BRING HIM BACK.
00:44:33.125,00:44:38.709,"WHICH BRINGS US TO THE THREE STAGES OF DEMONIC ACTIVITY: INFESTATION, OPPRESSION AND POSSESSION."
00:44:38.750,00:44:48.417,"NOW, INFESTATION: THAT'S THE WHISPERING, THE FOOTSTEPS, THE FEELING OF ANOTHER PRESENCE, WHICH ULTIMATELY GROWS INTO OPPRESSION, THE SECOND STAGE."
00:44:48.458,00:44:55.750,"NOW THIS IS WHERE THE VICTIM, AND IT'S USUALLY THE ONE WHO'S THE MOST PSYCHOLOGICALLY VULNERABLE, IS TARGETED SPECIFICALLY BY AN EXTERNAL FORCE."
00:44:55.792,00:44:59.375,BREAKS THE VICTIM DOWN.
00:44:59.417,00:45:05.041,"AND, ONCE IN A WEAKENED STATE, LEADS THEM TO THE THIRD AND FINAL STAGE: POSSESSION."
00:45:07.000,00:45:09.125,"HEY, ED?"
00:45:09.166,00:45:11.583,THERE'S SOMEONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU.

00:45:16.625,00:45:19.083,THERE'S SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAPPENING IN MY HOUSE.
00:45:19.125,00:45:20.792,COULD YOU COME AND TAKE A LOOK?
00:45:20.834,00:45:22.583,"YOU KNOW, UH, IT'S GETTIN' KINDA LATE."
00:45:22.625,00:45:24.542,WE REALLY NEED TO BE HEADIN' TO OUR FAMILY.
00:45:24.583,00:45:25.667,"NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND."
00:45:25.709,00:45:27.125,BUT WE DO.
00:45:27.166,00:45:28.667,THERE'S USUALLY SOME SORT OF RATIONAL EXPLANATION.
00:45:28.709,00:45:30.583,I HAVE FIVE DAUGHTERS WHO ARE SCARED TO DEATH.
00:45:30.625,00:45:33.166,I'M SO AFRAID THIS THING WANTS TO HURT US.
00:45:33.208,00:45:35.709,YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.

00:45:42.750,00:45:46.125,OF COURSE WE WILL.
00:45:56.792,00:45:59.125,"Marcia: COME ON, JAN!"
00:46:00.583,00:46:02.375,"JAN, WHAT HAPPENED?"
00:46:03.917,00:46:05.417,THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD TURNED BLACK.
00:46:05.458,00:46:06.875,Carolyn: HEY. YOU GUYS STRAIGHTEN UP? THANKS.
00:46:06.917,00:46:08.041,"Jan: DON'T BE SILLY, IT'S A WIG."

00:46:30.583,00:46:36.500,"THIS IS ANDREA, THE OLDEST, NANCY, CINDY, CHRISTINE, AND APRIL."
00:46:36.542,00:46:38.750,IT'S MR. AND MRS. WARREN.
00:46:38.792,00:46:41.041,"WE, UM, WE'RE ALL SLEEPING DOWN HERE NOW."
00:46:41.083,00:46:42.375,MM.
00:46:42.417,00:46:45.458,THE GIRLS FEEL SAFER AND IT'S WARMER.
00:46:45.500,00:46:49.083,"I'M CONSTANTLY TURNING UP THE HEAT, BUT THE HOUSE IS ALWAYS FREEZING."
00:46:49.125,00:46:51.875,"Roger: IT'S NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE FURNACE, THOUGH."
00:46:51.917,00:46:53.625,"I MEAN, NOT THAT I CAN FIND."
00:46:57.709,00:47:02.000,IT'S GOTTEN A LOT WORSE THE PAST FEW NIGHTS.
00:47:02.041,00:47:06.083,"THERE'S THIS AWFUL SMELL, LIKE ROTTING MEAT."
00:47:06.125,00:47:07.500,IT MOVES AROUND THE HOUSE.
00:47:09.417,00:47:11.542,UH...
00:47:11.583,00:47:12.917,WHAT?
00:47:12.959,00:47:19.000,"WELL, RANCID SMELLS COULD SOME TYPE OF DEMONIC ACTIVITY."
00:47:19.041,00:47:22.083,"OH, MY GOD."
00:47:24.834,00:47:26.959,"Roger: WELL, THAT'S TO KEEP THOSE DOORS FROM BANGIN' AT NIGHT."
00:47:27.000,00:47:29.083,"OTHERWISE, IT'S LIKE...."
00:47:29.125,00:47:30.583,"ALL NIGHT LONG, JUST LIKE THAT."
00:47:30.625,00:47:33.125,DOES IT COME IN THREES?
00:47:33.166,00:47:34.166,YEAH.
00:47:34.208,00:47:35.458,IT STOPS AT DAWN?
00:47:35.500,00:47:38.458,UH-HUH.
00:47:38.500,00:47:44.583,"WELL, SOMETIMES IT'S MEANT AS AN INSULT TO THE TRINITY: THE FATHER, THE SON AND THE HOLY SPIRIT."
00:47:46.250,00:47:53.625,"YOU KNOW, IT'S THE DAMNDEST THING, BUT WE ALSO GET ALL KINDS OF BIRDS THAT WILL JUST FLY AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AND BREAK THEIR NECKS."
00:47:53.667,00:47:54.792,MM. REALLY?
00:47:54.834,00:47:57.417,AND THE CLOCKS STOP AT 3:07 A.M.
00:47:57.458,00:47:59.667,ALL OF THEM?
00:48:02.959,00:48:05.959,"OH, WE WERE HANGING THOSE ALONG THE STAIRS."
00:48:06.000,00:48:11.041,"SOMETHING JUST KEPT KNOCKING THEM DOWN, SO WE STOPPED HANGING 'EM UP."
00:48:13.792,00:48:16.291,THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.
00:48:16.333,00:48:17.875,IT WAS HERE WHEN WE MOVED IN.
00:48:17.917,00:48:20.000,THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF STUFF IN THE CELLAR.
00:48:23.375,00:48:24.875,SHOW ME THE CELLAR.
00:48:36.959,00:48:39.917,Woman: LOOK WHAT SHE MADE ME DO.
00:48:39.959,00:48:42.417,"YOU PICKIN' UP ANYTHING IN HERE, HON?"
00:48:45.917,00:48:48.208,"SOMETHIN' AWFUL HAPPENED HERE, ED."
00:48:52.542,00:48:56.208,"THOSE BRUISES, THEY FROM SOMETHIN' THAT HAPPENED HERE?"
00:48:56.250,00:48:59.667,"OH, IT'S SOME IRON DEFICIENCY THING I HAVE."
00:49:01.917,00:49:05.750,"YOU KNOW, WITH ALL THAT'S BEEN GOIN' ON, WHY HAVEN'T YOU JUST MOVED OUT?"
00:49:05.792,00:49:07.917,"WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'D MOVE TO, YOU KNOW?"
00:49:07.959,00:49:12.834,WE GOT ALL OUR MONEY TIED UP IN THIS PLACE AND HAD A LOT OF REPAIRS ON TOP OF THAT.
00:49:12.875,00:49:17.291,AND I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S GONNA TAKE IN A FAMILY OF SEVEN INDEFINITELY.
00:49:17.333,00:49:19.291,THAT'S WHY WE TRACKED YOU DOWN.
00:49:19.333,00:49:21.750,WE'RE GLAD YOU FOUND US.
00:49:21.792,00:49:26.291,"ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET STARTED."
00:49:26.333,00:49:29.375,MY NAME IS ED WARREN.
00:49:29.417,00:49:36.875,"I'M SITTING HERE WITH CAROLYN PERRON, WHO, WITH HER FAMILY, HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SUPERNATURAL OCCURRENCES."
00:49:36.917,00:49:38.166,"OKAY, GO AHEAD."
00:49:40.083,00:49:41.959,WHERE DO I START?
00:49:42.000,00:49:44.667,FROM THE FIRST OCCURRENCE.
00:49:44.709,00:49:46.875,I GUESS IT WAS THE CLOCKS.
00:49:46.917,00:49:49.000,MOM AND DAD TELL ME THAT YOU HAVE A FRIEND.
00:49:49.041,00:49:51.542,HIS NAME'S RORY.
00:49:51.583,00:49:53.375,BUT HE'S ALWAYS SAD.
00:49:53.417,00:49:55.709,WHY'S THAT?
00:49:53.417,00:49:58.875,HE WON'T TELL ME BUT I THINK SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO HIM.
00:50:01.041,00:50:03.917,DO YOU MIND IF I TRY TO SEE RORY?
00:51:34.625,00:51:35.625,HEY.
00:51:45.959,00:51:47.875,WHAT IS IT?
00:52:08.458,00:52:12.875,"WE BOUGHT IT AT AUCTION FROM THE BANK, SO, YOU KNOW, WE NEVER KNEW WHO LIVED HERE."
00:52:17.000,00:52:23.917,"WELL, LORRAINE AND I BOTH FEEL THAT WHAT YOUR HOUSE NEEDS IS A CLEANSING."
00:52:23.959,00:52:25.333,AN EXORCISM.
00:52:25.375,00:52:28.375,"WHAT, EXORCISM?"
00:52:29.875,00:52:33.333,I THOUGHT THAT WAS -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHIN' THAT YOU DO TO PEOPLE.
00:52:33.375,00:52:34.917,"NO, NOT NECESSARILY, NO."
00:52:34.959,00:52:36.834,WE HAVE TO GET OUTTA HERE.
00:52:36.875,00:52:39.834,I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT GONNA HELP.
00:52:39.875,00:52:44.834,"LORRAINE SAW SOMETHIN', WHICH-- GO AHEAD, HON."
00:52:46.667,00:52:51.709,I'VE BEEN SEEING THE DARK ENTITY THAT HAUNTS YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR LAND.
00:52:56.083,00:53:00.208,I SAW IT FIRST WHEN I CAME THROUGH YOUR DOOR.
00:53:00.250,00:53:02.583,IT WAS LATCHED TO YOUR BACK.
00:53:04.834,00:53:09.792,AND THEN I SAW IT AGAIN WITH THE GIRLS WHEN WE WALKED INTO THE LIVING ROOM.
00:53:09.834,00:53:17.291,"AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GO, THIS DARK ENTITY HAS LATCHED ITSELF TO YOUR FAMILY AND IT'S FEEDING OFF YOU."
00:53:20.250,00:53:22.709,EVEN IF WE LEAVE?
00:53:22.750,00:53:25.333,"SOMETIMES WHEN YOU GET HAUNTED, IT'S LIKE STEPPIN' ON GUM."
00:53:25.375,00:53:27.875,YOU TAKE IT WITH YOU.
00:53:27.917,00:53:36.750,"Lorraine: LOOK, I GOTTA TELL YOU, YOU HAVE A LOT OF SPIRITS IN HERE, BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT, BECAUSE IT IS SO HATEFUL."
00:53:36.792,00:53:38.834,"OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO?"
00:53:38.875,00:53:40.500,CAN WE CALL A PRIEST?
00:53:40.542,00:53:42.208,Ed: I WISH IT WERE THAT EASY.
00:53:42.250,00:53:44.709,PERFORMING AN EXORCISM IS AN ARCHAIC PROCEDURE.
00:53:44.750,00:53:46.709,REQUIRES YEARS OF TRAINING.
00:53:46.750,00:53:51.083,"AND EVEN THEN, I HAVE SEEN IT GO HORRIBLY WRONG."
00:53:51.125,00:53:55.625,"BUT BEFORE WE EVEN GET THAT FAR, THE CHURCH HAS TO AUTHORIZE IT FIRST."
00:53:55.667,00:54:00.792,"IT MEANS WE GOTTA INVESTIGATE, GATHER EVIDENCE AND PROVIDE PROOF, AND THAT'S THE HARD PART."
00:54:03.041,00:54:04.667,HAVE YOUR CHILDREN BEEN BAPTIZED?
00:54:04.709,00:54:06.667,"Roger: UH, NO, WE NEVER GOT AROUND TO THAT."
00:54:06.709,00:54:09.166,WE'RE NOT REALLY A CHURCHGOING FAMILY.
00:54:09.208,00:54:11.792,"WELL, YOU MAY WANT TO RETHINK THAT."
00:54:11.834,00:54:13.667,OUR PRESENCE HERE COULD MAKE THINGS WORSE.
00:54:13.709,00:54:15.375,BECAUSE WE'RE A THREAT.
00:54:15.417,00:54:18.834,AND WHATEVER YOU'RE DEALING WITH HERE ISN'T GONNA LIKE US.
00:54:18.875,00:54:22.375,"SO FAR IT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING VIOLENT, AND THAT'S A GOOD SIGN."
00:54:22.417,00:54:26.959,"SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR GUY DO SOME HOMEWORK ON THE PROPERTY, THOUGH, TO SEE WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST."
00:54:28.834,00:54:31.709,"Lorraine: JUDY, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?"
00:54:31.750,00:54:33.166,I GOT YOU A PRESENT.
00:54:34.667,00:54:37.667,ME AND NANNA GOT THESE AT THE CHURCH'S YARD SALE.
00:54:37.709,00:54:38.834,HONEY.
00:54:38.875,00:54:39.875,ONE FOR YOU AND ONE FOR ME.
00:54:39.917,00:54:41.250,AWW!
00:54:41.291,00:54:43.000,SHE PUT A PICTURE OF YOU AND DADDY IN MINE.

00:55:45.458,00:55:48.125,THAT'S THE ORIGINAL FARMHOUSE.
00:55:48.166,00:55:54.375,"IT WAS BUILT IN 1863 BY A MAN NAMED JEDSON SHERMAN, WHO WAS MARRIED TO A WOMAN NAMED BATHSHEBA."
00:55:54.417,00:55:57.750,"ED, SHE'S RELATED TO MARY TOWNE ESTYE."
00:55:57.792,00:55:59.959,SHE WAS ONE OF THE WOMEN ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT IN SALEM.
00:56:00.000,00:56:02.125,SHE WAS HUNG DURING THE TRIALS.
00:56:02.166,00:56:10.291,"AFTER BATHSHEBA MARRIED JEDSON, THEY HAD A BABY, AND WHEN THE BABY WAS 7 DAYS OLD, JEDSON CAUGHT HER SACRIFICING IT IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE."
00:56:10.333,00:56:20.542,"SHE RAN OUT TO THAT TREE BY THE DOCK, CLIMBED UP, PROCLAIMED HER LOVE TO SATAN, AND CURSED ANYONE WHO TRIED TO TAKE HER LAND, AND HUNG HERSELF."
00:56:20.583,00:56:24.250,TIME OF DEATH WAS PRONOUNCED AT 3:07 IN THE MORNING.
00:56:24.291,00:56:26.750,"WELL, THAT EXPLAINS A FEW THINGS."
00:56:26.792,00:56:29.041,"YEAH, SO DOES THIS."
00:56:29.083,00:56:31.625,HER LAST NAME'S WALKER.
00:56:31.667,00:56:34.875,SHE HAD A BOY NAMED RORY WHO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEARED IN THE WOODS.
00:56:34.917,00:56:36.750,THEN SHE KILLED HERSELF IN THE CELLAR.
00:56:36.792,00:56:38.792,AND THAT'S NOT ALL.
00:56:41.333,00:56:46.542,"SO, WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL 200-ACRE FARM HAS SINCE BEEN SUBDIVIDED AND SOLD OFF."
00:56:46.583,00:56:48.667,THERE WAS ANOTHER BOY WHO DROWNED IN A POND HERE.
00:56:48.709,00:56:50.417,HE LIVED IN A HOUSE OVER HERE.
00:56:50.458,00:56:54.625,"AND A WOMAN WHO WORKED AS A MAID IN A NEIGHBORING HOME, SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE TOO."
00:56:56.333,00:56:58.125,PEOPLE WHO TOOK HER LAND.
00:56:59.917,00:57:05.625,"I'M SITTING HERE WITH CAROLYN PERRON, WHO, WITH HER FAMILY, HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING SUPERNATURAL OCCURRENCES."

00:58:52.542,00:58:54.583,WHAT'S NOT WRONG WITH HER?
00:58:54.625,00:58:56.291,NEEDS A NEW CARBURETOR TO START.
00:58:56.333,00:58:57.875,"OH, YEAH?"
00:58:57.917,00:59:00.250,KIND OF PUT FIXING HER UP ON HOLD FOR AWHILE.

00:59:11.125,00:59:14.917,"WELL, WHEN THERE'S AN INSTANT DROP IN TEMPERATURE, THE THERMOSTAT TRIGGERS THE CAMERA TO TAKE A PICTURE."
00:59:14.959,00:59:18.041,YOU'VE ACTUALLY CAUGHT THINGS ON FILM?
00:59:18.083,00:59:21.333,"WELL, YEAH, THAT'S, UH, THE POINT."

00:59:28.166,00:59:32.125,SHE HUNG HERSELF FROM THAT BRANCH RIGHT ABOVE WHERE YOU'RE STANDIN'.
00:59:38.417,00:59:40.834,Carolyn: HOW COULD A MOTHER KILL HER OWN CHILD?
00:59:40.875,00:59:42.750,IT WAS NEVER A CHILD TO HER.
00:59:42.792,00:59:47.250,SHE JUST USED HER GOD-GIVEN GIFT AS THE ULTIMATE OFFENSE AGAINST HIM.
00:59:47.291,00:59:50.375,WITCHES BELIEVE IT ELEVATES THEIR STATUS IN THE EYES OF SATAN.
00:59:58.709,01:00:00.375,MM.
01:00:00.417,01:00:02.166,WOW.

01:00:04.041,01:00:06.333,HOW DID YOU KNOW?
01:00:06.375,01:00:07.667,IT'S AN INSIGHT.
01:00:07.709,01:00:10.709,IT'S LIKE A PEEK THROUGH THE CURTAIN INTO ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE.
01:00:10.750,01:00:13.000,MM.
01:00:13.041,01:00:14.792,MM.
01:00:14.834,01:00:17.250,THAT DAY MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.
01:00:17.291,01:00:18.917,WE WERE DRIVING ALONG THE COAST.
01:00:18.959,01:00:21.917,NANCY POINTED OUT HOW PRETTY THE VIEW WAS.
01:00:21.959,01:00:25.250,I THOUGHT THIS IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR A PHOTO.
01:00:25.291,01:00:27.041,"WE WERE GONNA START FRESH, YOU KNOW?"
01:00:27.083,01:00:28.542,"A NEW HOUSE, A NEW BEGINNING."
01:00:28.583,01:00:30.375,YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ROGER AND THE GIRLS.
01:00:30.417,01:00:31.625,I'VE NEVER SEEN THEM SO HAPPY.
01:00:31.667,01:00:33.333,All: CHEESE!
01:00:33.375,01:00:36.750,THEY MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.

01:01:01.834,01:01:03.291,SEE?
01:01:03.333,01:01:05.875,IT JUST REVEALS TO US WHAT THE NAKED EYE CAN'T SEE.
01:01:05.917,01:01:07.959,"PRETTY FAR OUT, ISN'T IT?"
01:01:08.000,01:01:11.041,"YEAH, IT'S GROOVY."
01:01:15.792,01:01:17.917,"DREW, YOU GOT THE BOLEX READY FOR BRAD?"
01:01:17.959,01:01:21.291,"YEAH, ALREADY LOCKED AND LOADED, SIR."

01:02:12.792,01:02:15.333,WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE?
01:02:15.375,01:02:16.417,HOLY WATER.
01:02:18.500,01:02:23.667,PRESENCE OF RELIGIOUS ICONS WILL GET A REACTION FROM ANYTHING UNHOLY.
01:02:25.834,01:02:29.208,SORT OF PISSES THEM OFF.
01:02:29.250,01:02:33.875,"SO I SET THESE THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE, SEE IF I CAN STIR THINGS UP A BIT."
01:02:33.917,01:02:36.875,LIKE HOLDING A CROSS TO A VAMPIRE?
01:02:36.917,01:02:39.417,YEAH. EXACTLY.
01:02:39.458,01:02:42.458,EXCEPT I DON'T BELIEVE IN VAMPIRES.
01:02:46.709,01:02:53.709,WASN'T ME.
01:03:01.750,01:03:03.917,"Ed: BRAD, GET THE CAMERA."

01:03:19.250,01:03:22.959,I HAVE LORRAINE AND OFFICER BRAD HAMILTON WITH ME.
01:03:23.000,01:03:24.792,LET'S KEEP THE CELLAR LIGHT OFF.
01:03:39.208,01:03:41.917,GIVE US A SIGN THAT YOU WANNA COMMUNICATE WITH US.
01:04:10.291,01:04:12.500,"HON, YOU ALL RIGHT?"
01:04:16.583,01:04:20.208,THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING HERE.
01:04:20.250,01:04:21.750,"ALL RIGHT, CLOSE THE DOOR."

01:05:05.834,01:05:08.166,WATCH OUT!
01:05:10.917,01:05:15.959,"Drew: FOR A GUY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE, YOU LOOKED A LITTLE FREAKED OUT WHEN THAT DOOR SLAMMED SHUT."
01:05:18.917,01:05:21.959,IT MUST HAVE BEEN A DRAFT.
01:05:22.000,01:05:23.500,"OH, THAT'S FUNNY."
01:05:23.542,01:05:27.166,A DRAFT NEVER PUT THAT LOOK ON MY FACE BEFORE.
01:05:28.834,01:05:32.250,I BELIEVE THE CLOCK.
01:05:32.291,01:05:34.125,IT'S 3:08.
01:05:45.458,01:05:47.208,FOR YOU.
01:05:47.250,01:05:49.625,Roger: I THINK I MIGHT TAKE SOME GIRLS FOR ICE CREAM LATER ON.
01:05:49.667,01:05:51.125,WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT?
01:05:51.166,01:05:52.709,YEAH!
01:05:52.750,01:05:54.542,"HONEY, YOU WANNA COME?"
01:05:54.583,01:05:56.041,I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A NAP.
01:05:56.083,01:05:57.792,THE LATE NIGHTS ARE -- THEY'RE GETTIN' TO ME.
01:05:57.834,01:05:59.583,THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.
01:05:59.625,01:06:01.291,LORRAINE AND I'LL WATCH OVER THINGS FOR A BIT.
01:06:01.333,01:06:03.291,Brad: I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.
01:06:03.333,01:06:04.917,I HAVE A SHIFT STARTING IN AN HOUR.
01:06:04.959,01:06:07.250,LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME.
01:06:07.291,01:06:10.333,I THINK THE KIDS FEEL A LOT SAFER WITH YOU AROUND.
01:06:13.041,01:06:14.750,I COULD GET USED TO THIS.
01:06:14.792,01:06:16.417,"WHAT, ME DOING LAUNDRY?"
01:06:18.458,01:06:20.834,YOU'RE FUNNY.

01:06:28.667,01:06:31.333,"THEY HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, DON'T THEY?"
01:06:31.375,01:06:35.917,"YEAH, THAT LITTLE ONE, APRIL, DID YOU SEE HER BRING ME PANCAKES?"
01:06:41.166,01:06:44.000,WE'VE GOTTA HELP THEM.
01:06:44.041,01:06:45.875,I KNOW.
01:06:45.917,01:06:47.166,I'LL START WITH THE CHEVY.

01:08:24.959,01:08:26.333,"OH, I'M FINE."
01:08:26.375,01:08:29.125,"I WOKE UP JUST FEELING A LITTLE NAUSEOUS, THAT'S ALL."
01:08:27.875,01:08:31.625,I THOUGHT I SAW-- I HEAR ROGER AND THE GIRLS.
01:08:31.667,01:08:32.959,ONE MINUTE.
01:08:44.667,01:08:46.542,"April: HEY, GUYS, DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME?"
01:08:46.583,01:08:47.959,Cindy: BORING!
01:08:48.000,01:08:51.041,LET'S GO PLAY!
01:08:54.625,01:08:56.291,Roger: I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.
01:08:56.333,01:08:57.542,"HEY, I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND."
01:08:57.583,01:09:00.500,I GOT A GOOD DEAL ON A REBUILD AT THAT WRECKING YARD IN SMITHFIELD.
01:09:00.542,01:09:02.250,"NO, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'."
01:09:02.291,01:09:03.375,"YEAH, WE'LL SEE."
01:09:06.875,01:09:08.458,"GOT A NICE PLACE HERE, ROGER."
01:09:08.500,01:09:10.834,LORRAINE AND I ALWAYS WANTED A SPOT IN THE COUNTRY.
01:09:10.875,01:09:13.375,I'LL SELL YOU THIS ONE.
01:09:13.417,01:09:16.041,"HEY, HAND ME A WRENCH, WOULD YA?"
01:09:18.583,01:09:23.166,"HEY, UH, IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO US TO HAVE YOU HERE."
01:09:23.208,01:09:27.250,"I GOTTA ADMIT, I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL GOING IN."
01:09:27.291,01:09:30.750,"JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU, THOUGH, FOR COMIN' OUT WHEN YOU DID."
01:09:32.500,01:09:34.000,I CAN'T TAKE THE CREDIT.
01:09:34.041,01:09:36.166,"THAT'S, UH, THAT'S ALL LORRAINE."
01:09:36.208,01:09:37.625,I DIDN'T WANT TO.
01:09:37.667,01:09:39.000,OH. WHY'S THAT?
01:09:42.208,01:09:45.750,"WHATEVER LORRAINE SEES, FEELS, TOUCHES, IT HELPS PEOPLE."
01:09:45.792,01:09:48.291,BUT IT ALSO TAKES A TOLL ON HER.
01:09:48.333,01:09:51.917,LITTLE PIECE EACH TIME.
01:09:51.959,01:09:56.041,COUPLE MONTHS AGO WE WERE WORKIN' ON A CASE.

01:10:13.500,01:10:22.208,"WHEN WE GOT HOME, SHE WENT INTO OUR ROOM, LOCKED HERSELF IN, DIDN'T TALK, DIDN'T EAT, DIDN'T COME OUT FOR EIGHT DAYS."
01:10:22.250,01:10:23.750,WHAT'D SHE SEE?
