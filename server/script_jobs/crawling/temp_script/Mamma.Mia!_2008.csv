00:01:41.346,00:01:42.598,Harry Bright.
00:01:54.994,00:01:56.495,"Gentlemen, I have to go."
00:01:56.579,00:01:59.071,Thank you very much. You take care.
00:02:06.013,00:02:07.037,"Morning, Rodney."
00:02:26.365,00:02:27.366,Taxi!
00:02:29.493,00:02:31.411,"JFK, please, as quick as you can."
00:02:54.042,00:02:58.224,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
00:03:10.266,00:03:11.266,-I'm tough. -I'm tall.
00:03:16.121,00:03:17.955,Sophie!
00:03:18.039,00:03:21.517,"-It's beautiful. I want one. -He did well, didn't he?"
00:03:21.642,00:03:23.478,I'm getting married tomorrow!
00:03:23.936,00:03:29.358,I'm so glad you're here because I have a secret and I can't tell anybody else.
00:03:29.817,00:03:33.738,-Sophie! You're knocked up? -No! No! No!
00:03:34.280,00:03:36.949,"Um, I've invited my dad to my wedding."
00:03:37.116,00:03:40.411,-You are joking! -You found him at last?
00:03:40.620,00:03:42.538,"No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly."
00:03:45.333,00:03:49.962,Okay. You know what my mom always said when I asked about my father.
00:03:50.463,00:03:58.596,"It was a summer romance, and he'd gone long before she realized that she was expecting me. And I'd always kind of accepted that that's all I'd ever know."
00:03:59.113,00:04:03.326,"Well, I was ransacking some old trunks and I found this."
00:04:04.887,00:04:07.771,It's the diary she kept the year she was pregnant with me.
00:04:07.855,00:04:09.440,"Oh, Sophie!"
00:04:10.149,00:04:12.902,July 17th.
00:04:13.194,00:04:15.821,-What a night! -I don't know if I want to hear this.
00:04:15.905,00:04:16.947,I do.
00:04:17.031,00:04:19.283,Sam rowed me over to the little island.
00:04:19.367,00:04:21.202,That's here. That's Kalokairi.
00:04:22.078,00:04:28.126,"We danced on the beach, and we kissed on the beach, and dot, dot, dot."
00:04:28.417,00:04:30.085,"-What? -Dot, dot, dot."
00:04:30.169,00:04:32.213,That's what they did in the olden days.
00:04:32.421,00:04:34.215,-Oh! -Stop it.
00:04:35.341,00:04:38.136,Sam's the one. I know he is.
00:04:38.302,00:04:40.638,I've never felt like this before.
00:05:39.447,00:05:41.616,"So this guy, Sam, is your father."
00:05:41.782,00:05:43.367,The plot thickens.
00:05:43.576,00:05:46.495,"All this time, Sam has been telling me he loves me."
00:05:47.205,00:05:53.377,"And now he's announced that he's engaged, so he's gone home to get married and I'm never going to see him again."
00:05:53.502,00:05:54.753,Poor Donna.
00:05:54.837,00:05:57.131,August 4th. What a night.
00:05:58.758,00:06:03.512,Bill rented a motorboat and I took him over to the little island.
00:06:03.596,00:06:05.973,"-Bill? Sophie, wait! -Hang on!"
00:06:06.766,00:06:12.896,"Though I'm still obsessed with Sam, Bill's so wild. He's such a funny guy."
00:06:12.980,00:06:16.651,"One thing led to another, and, dot, dot, dot!"
00:06:16.859,00:06:22.823,"August 11th. Harry turned up out of the blue, so I said I'd show him the island."
00:06:22.990,00:06:26.118,"He's so sweet and understanding, I couldn't help it. And..."
00:06:31.457,00:06:32.875,-Donna! -Donna!
00:06:33.626,00:06:36.295,Look at you. Oh...
00:06:36.827,00:06:39.173,God. Stop growing!
00:06:40.840,00:06:42.426,You sound like you're having fun already.
00:06:42.510,00:06:43.719,"Oh, we are."
00:07:16.544,00:07:18.379,-Whoa! -Come back!
00:07:20.172,00:07:23.634,-Bugger. -My sentiments exactly.
00:07:28.764,00:07:31.141,"So who is your dad? Sam, Bill or Harry?"
00:07:31.225,00:07:33.728,-I don't know. -But which one did you invite?
00:07:40.026,00:07:41.360,Do they know?
00:07:41.444,00:07:43.111,What would you write to a total stranger?
00:07:43.195,00:07:45.864,"Please come to my wedding, you might be my father? No."
00:07:45.948,00:07:51.787,"They think that Mom sent the invites, and with what's in here, no surprise, they said yes!"
00:08:26.197,00:08:29.408,I'm trying to get to Kalokairi. When's the next ferry?
00:08:32.578,00:08:34.413,-What? -Monday.
00:08:35.122,00:08:38.125,"-Bollocks. -Yeah, my sentiments exactly."
00:08:40.920,00:08:43.631,-Bride or groom? -Bride.
00:08:44.048,00:08:45.966,Although I've actually never met her.
00:08:54.058,00:08:56.685,"Oh! Excuse me, coming through!"
00:08:56.769,00:08:59.814,I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you.
00:09:00.439,00:09:05.110,-My mother needs a perch. -Mother? We're the same age.
00:09:05.194,00:09:08.239,"Yeah. Well, parts of us are."
00:09:10.658,00:09:12.201,Ooh. Sailor.
00:09:13.953,00:09:15.537,"Um, no."
00:09:24.672,00:09:28.217,"-Oh, he has your book. -Oh."
00:09:30.386,00:09:33.556,"-Stavros, Stavros. -Stavros."
00:09:44.900,00:09:46.819,It's just a fish.
00:09:47.653,00:09:49.654,You are so clever.
00:09:49.738,00:09:51.740,We're going to look fabulous tomorrow.
00:09:52.324,00:09:55.786,"I want the perfect wedding, and I want my father to give me away."
00:09:55.870,00:09:58.330,Better be a wide aisle. Ow.
00:09:58.622,00:10:01.250,I will know my father as soon as I see him.
00:10:02.835,00:10:04.712,"Sky! Come here, gorgeous!"
00:10:04.920,00:10:07.089,Put me down! I'm getting married tomorrow!
00:10:07.173,00:10:08.841,-Please be careful. -So?
00:10:08.966,00:10:11.635,-There are pins in the dresses! -What do you think?
00:10:12.303,00:10:14.888,"-Oh, yes. -Oh, yes."
00:10:14.972,00:10:20.352,"If you had your way, it'd be a three-minute wedding in jeans and T-shirts, washed down with a bottle of beer."
00:10:20.519,00:10:22.604,You make me sound so unromantic.
00:10:22.688,00:10:24.815,I just thought we should save our money for traveling.
00:10:24.899,00:10:26.691,"Well, we're not going anywhere yet."
00:10:26.775,00:10:29.236,"Anyway, please leave. We're very, very busy."
00:10:29.695,00:10:31.739,I'm just getting some props for tonight.
00:10:31.989,00:10:34.533,-Ooh! -For his bachelor party.
00:10:38.454,00:10:40.831,Why haven't you told him you've invited your dads?
00:10:40.915,00:10:43.126,Because he would say that I'd have to tell my mom.
00:10:43.210,00:10:45.293,Donna's absolutely gonna kill you when she finds out.
00:10:45.377,00:10:47.713,"By the time she finds out, it'll be too late."
00:10:49.882,00:10:51.800,I feel like there's a part of me missing.
00:10:54.220,00:10:55.846,And when I meet my dad...
00:10:58.766,00:11:00.518,everything...
00:11:01.435,00:11:03.062,will fall into place.
00:11:10.536,00:11:12.487,-More open! -I'm on it. I'm on it.
00:11:15.950,00:11:17.243,That's it.
00:11:25.501,00:11:27.127,"Come on, Cleopatra."
00:11:40.432,00:11:43.185,Will you look at what the tide washed in?
00:11:45.020,00:11:49.400,-For one night! -And one night only!
00:12:03.622,00:12:05.040,Look at you.
00:12:05.624,00:12:07.876,-You baby. -Look at you.
00:12:07.960,00:12:10.587,-You look fantastic. -You look like an old hippie.
00:12:10.671,00:12:12.714,"Oh, she looks fab."
00:12:12.798,00:12:14.799,"These are new, though. Where did you get these?"
00:12:14.883,00:12:16.718,Husband number three!
00:12:31.358,00:12:36.404,So any men at this wedding? Gorgeous Greeks of independent means?
00:12:36.488,00:12:39.407,Here we go! Husband number four!
00:12:39.491,00:12:43.203,"-He's coming! -No. Not for me, for her."
00:12:43.370,00:12:51.211,"For her, now that her book is a bestseller, and she's got the whole world stuffing, what, mushrooms?"
00:12:51.545,00:12:53.505,Various vegetables?
00:12:53.589,00:12:58.468,"-It's time to find Mr. Right. -Oh, please! Boring!"
00:12:58.552,00:13:01.596,Great couple of role models you two are for Sophie.
00:13:01.680,00:13:04.057,A serial bride and a little hermit over here.
00:13:05.559,00:13:08.312,That's me. I'm a lone wolf.
00:13:18.697,00:13:23.285,"You know, I do not know what's going on in that child's head sometimes."
00:13:23.452,00:13:28.999,"She wants a big white wedding, and she and Sky are making all kind of plans for the hotel."
00:13:29.124,00:13:31.209,Sometimes I think they'll never leave.
00:13:31.293,00:13:33.461,"Yeah, but do you really want her to?"
00:13:33.545,00:13:35.881,"Well, I want what's best for her."
00:13:45.057,00:13:46.891,He's the leading man at tomorrow's shindig.
00:13:46.975,00:13:48.643,-The lucky man. -Hello!
00:13:48.727,00:13:51.229,-You must be Rosie. -I am.
00:13:51.313,00:13:53.982,-How are you? -Very well. Oh.
00:13:54.358,00:13:58.112,And you must be Tanya. I've heard so much about you.
00:14:00.155,00:14:01.615,-Yes. -And all true.
00:14:01.699,00:14:03.242,"Donna. Here, let me get them."
00:14:04.910,00:14:08.664,"I know who you are. You're Bill Anderson, aren't you?"
00:14:10.791,00:14:12.751,Bloke In A Boat In Botswana.
00:14:13.001,00:14:14.377,"Yes, I am."
00:14:14.461,00:14:16.922,"You know, your books are a godsend on dull business trips."
00:14:17.715,00:14:25.263,"Now, I may look like I'm pondering my securities, but in reality, I'm trekking across some remote corner of the planet."
00:14:25.347,00:14:27.349,You should try it for real sometime.
00:14:27.433,00:14:30.477,"No, certainly, I'll never be the spontaneous adventurer."
00:14:30.561,00:14:32.563,You're a close friend of Donna's?
00:14:32.730,00:14:34.606,"No, I haven't heard from her for 20 years."
00:14:34.690,00:14:37.400,-Really? -And then this invite out of the blue.
00:14:37.484,00:14:39.361,"You know, that's a coincidence, neither had I."
00:14:39.486,00:14:40.987,-Going about. -You got it.
00:14:41.071,00:14:42.739,Aye-aye. Right.
00:14:44.867,00:14:47.494,I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. Fine. Fine.
00:14:49.455,00:14:51.373,You should have brought the iron lung.
00:14:55.461,00:14:57.337,"-Oxygen. -Oh, my God."
00:14:58.922,00:15:01.383,-Auntie Rosie! -Hey!
00:15:01.467,00:15:04.511,Look at Sophie. She's gotten so beautiful.
00:15:04.595,00:15:05.804,I know.
00:15:05.888,00:15:10.975,Come here to me! Oh! Sophie Sheridan.
00:15:11.059,00:15:16.273,You get more gorgeous every time I see you.
00:15:16.774,00:15:19.859,-I bet you don't remember me. -Not with all that plastic surgery.
00:15:21.820,00:15:25.616,"Of course I do, Auntie Tanya. You haven't changed at all."
00:15:26.408,00:15:27.742,I'm so happy for you.
00:15:27.826,00:15:30.204,Her whole life ahead of her.
00:15:30.496,00:15:35.208,"Oh, please, I'm getting married! I'm not joining a convent!"
00:15:37.711,00:15:40.088,-Yeah. -She's a chip off the old block.
00:15:40.172,00:15:44.301,"Ooh. If she were more like me, she wouldn't be getting married at 20."
00:15:46.970,00:15:49.806,"Oh, I meant to get the laundry down before you came."
00:15:51.433,00:15:57.397,"And you'd think with all this new technology, they would figure out a machine that would make the beds."
00:15:57.481,00:16:02.819,"And if they did, you'd be going along behind it making them again. I know you, Mom."
00:16:02.903,00:16:09.617,Aww. But I am good at modern-- Tell them about the Internets. He's gonna put me on the line.
00:16:11.745,00:16:15.915,I just think this place has so much potential and no one knows we're here.
00:16:15.999,00:16:20.336,"So, if I market it really, really well, then, hopefully, people will come flooding in."
00:16:20.420,00:16:24.114,We just want this to be the ultimate romantic destination.
00:16:24.264,00:16:28.303,"This was once supposed to be the site of Aphrodite's fountain, you know, the goddess of love."
00:16:28.387,00:16:32.182,"If you drank the water, you were supposed to find true love and perfect happiness."
00:16:32.266,00:16:35.143,"-I'll have a glass of that. -Yeah, I'll have a bucket."
00:16:37.271,00:16:39.814,"Well, I thought you didn't want boatloads of tourists."
00:16:39.898,00:16:41.900,"Oh, no, not boatloads, no."
00:16:41.984,00:16:45.612,"But, you know, a few more would be nice."
00:16:46.822,00:16:56.998,"Okay, now, the thing about the toilet, if it doesn't flush right away, just go and come back in a while, and it should..."
00:16:57.082,00:16:59.418,"Nothing works around here, except for me."
00:16:59.585,00:17:03.630,I've been running this hotel for 15 years and I have never had a day off.
00:17:03.714,00:17:06.258,"Oh, my God! Sorry."
00:17:19.521,00:17:20.605,Don't sit down there.
00:17:22.274,00:17:23.399,It's broken.
00:17:38.123,00:17:39.374,Huh.
00:20:00.515,00:20:02.559,What's going on?
00:20:02.851,00:20:04.435,"-Do you feel it? -Oh, my..."
00:20:04.519,00:20:07.355,"The earth moved, darling. We're falling apart here."
00:20:07.522,00:20:09.190,Don't think about it. Come on.
00:20:09.274,00:20:11.109,Let's go have fun.
00:20:24.164,00:20:26.458,"Oh, Donna? Donna!"
00:20:32.541,00:20:33.516,"Oh, listen to this."
00:20:33.757,00:20:36.545,The world's most luxurious moisturizer.
00:20:36.645,00:20:41.681,Contains flakes of 24-karat gold and extracts of donkey testicle.
00:20:41.765,00:20:45.518,"-You're just jealous. -At $1,000 a dollop."
00:20:45.602,00:20:49.648,That's the price you have to pay if you wanna drink before 11:00 in the morning!
00:20:49.815,00:20:51.358,-And we do! -Whoo!
00:20:54.027,00:20:55.362,Hi.
00:20:56.363,00:20:59.324,-May I help you? -Sure. We're here for the wedding.
00:20:59.449,00:21:01.326,-I'm Bill Anderson. -Huh?
00:21:01.576,00:21:03.829,"I'm Bright, Harry Bright."
00:21:04.704,00:21:06.331,Sam Carmichael.
00:21:13.296,00:21:16.716,"-You are expecting us? -Oh, my God. Yes."
00:21:17.926,00:21:20.220,You're not Donna's daughter?
00:21:22.889,00:21:25.642,"-Uh, Sofia. -It's Sophie."
00:21:25.851,00:21:30.313,"-Well, Sofia is the Greek. -Well, I'm named after a Sofia."
00:21:30.397,00:21:34.943,"I used to have a great-aunt living on the mainland, named Sofia."
00:21:37.154,00:21:39.614,-before we see your mother? -Sure.
00:21:39.739,00:21:42.575,It's just that I'd like to freshen up before the big reunion.
00:21:42.659,00:21:43.910,No! No.
00:21:43.994,00:21:47.747,"I mean, yes. But come this way."
00:22:01.303,00:22:02.637,Come on.
00:22:08.185,00:22:11.562,"Oh, my God. I got a crack in my courtyard."
00:22:11.646,00:22:14.774,"-I gotta go fix it. -Hey, listen, Donna. Donna."
00:22:15.984,00:22:18.569,-Sit down. -She won't let me go!
00:22:18.653,00:22:23.474,I know you're going to make a fortune with web's-- -With web's. -Sky's site.
00:22:23.574,00:22:27.703,-I know you're gonna make a fortune... -Sky's website-- -...but-- Sky's web site. -It's good.
00:22:27.787,00:22:29.914,But are you gonna be okay until then?
00:22:29.998,00:22:32.458,I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling.
00:22:32.542,00:22:34.961,"-No, seriously, Donna. -Oh, my God."
00:22:35.045,00:22:37.296,"-Do you need a loan? -No, sweet!"
00:22:37.380,00:22:41.050,"Oh, God, I'm just whining, you know me."
00:22:41.134,00:22:43.344,I don't need to be taken care of.
00:22:43.428,00:22:46.055,"Yeah, but are you being taken care of?"
00:22:46.139,00:22:48.391,-What do you mean? -Are you getting any?
00:22:55.565,00:22:58.568,"Down, boy, down, boy. No, it takes too much energy."
00:22:58.652,00:23:01.696,"Yeah, just more plumbing to be maintained, isn't it?"
00:23:03.949,00:23:07.076,I'm so glad that whole part of my life is over.
00:23:09.955,00:23:12.624,I do not miss it at all.
00:23:16.795,00:23:19.714,Then it's just right in here. Good.
00:23:22.133,00:23:24.344,Where's Donna? Hey. Okay.
00:23:26.471,00:23:28.056,Up you go.
00:23:34.354,00:23:35.563,Oh!
00:23:36.439,00:23:37.607,Hmm.
00:23:38.441,00:23:40.068,You know...
00:23:40.652,00:23:45.489,"I don't want to seem ungrateful for the scenic tour, but might I be shown my room now?"
00:23:45.573,00:23:48.702,"Well, don't hold your breath, Harry, but I think this is your room."
00:23:48.827,00:23:50.620,Can-- Can we see Donna now?
00:23:51.746,00:23:55.583,I sent the invites. My mom doesn't know anything.
00:23:55.959,00:23:57.752,Oh! Good.
00:23:58.476,00:24:02.924,"Well, she's done so much for me, and she's always talking about you guys and the good old days."
00:24:03.133,00:24:09.014,And I thought what an amazing surprise for her that you are all gonna be at my wedding.
00:24:13.727,00:24:19.482,"The last time I saw your mother, she said she never wanted -to see me again. -But that was years ago. Please."
00:24:19.566,00:24:22.318,-It would mean a lot to me. -Why?
00:24:25.280,00:24:27.365,Might I suggest that we all reconvene on your boat?
00:24:27.449,00:24:28.449,Good idea.
00:24:28.533,00:24:30.451,-Nope. -Why?
00:24:30.535,00:24:32.745,"It's an adventure, Harry. It's good for you."
00:24:32.829,00:24:33.829,"Oh, I see."
00:24:33.913,00:24:37.083,"Okay, when I sent the invites, it was a long shot that you'd even reply."
00:24:37.167,00:24:40.045,And now you've come all this way for a wedding.
00:24:40.545,00:24:44.632,Surely there must've been some special reason for you to be here.
00:24:45.633,00:24:49.262,"Like... some siren call, maybe?"
00:24:50.889,00:24:52.807,"Oh, you are a little minx, you know that?"
00:24:52.891,00:24:55.935,You're just like your mother. I'm glad my boys haven't met you.
00:24:56.019,00:24:58.145,-They'd never recover. -You have sons?
00:24:58.229,00:24:59.647,"Yes, two."
00:25:00.273,00:25:02.149,"And someday, I'd like to bring them here."
00:25:02.233,00:25:04.360,Like you used to bring my mother?
00:25:13.578,00:25:15.205,-No. -It's Donna.
00:25:15.330,00:25:18.040,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen, she can't know."
00:25:18.124,00:25:19.542,I'm going to go. Please stay.
00:25:19.626,00:25:23.630,Promise me that you'll not tell anybody that I invited you.
00:25:23.755,00:25:26.216,"-Okay? Promise? -You got it, baby."
00:25:26.383,00:25:27.508,It's a promise.
00:25:27.592,00:25:29.510,"I might regret it, but okay."
00:25:29.594,00:25:30.970,Okay.
00:25:36.935,00:25:40.730,"There wouldn't by any chance happen to be a trouser press on the island, would there?"
00:26:01.376,00:26:02.794,Harry?
00:28:31.067,00:28:32.735,Oh-- Oh!
00:28:34.988,00:28:36.698,You always knew how to make an entrance.
00:28:40.785,00:28:43.246,I'd better be dreaming. You'd better not be here.
00:28:43.371,00:28:45.080,"You want me to pinch you, Donna?"
00:28:45.164,00:28:50.878,"No, you keep your hands to yourself, Bill Anderson."
00:28:51.296,00:28:53.673,"You probably don't recognize me, do you?"
00:28:54.882,00:28:57.218,Harry. It is you.
00:28:58.177,00:29:01.139,"I probably changed a bit, but you certainly haven't."
00:29:01.306,00:29:02.682,Mm-hmm.
00:29:03.224,00:29:06.019,Why are you here? What are you doing here?
00:29:06.144,00:29:07.520,I'm writing a travel piece.
00:29:07.854,00:29:09.980,I'm here on a spontaneous holiday.
00:29:10.064,00:29:11.106,Uh-huh.
00:29:14.485,00:29:16.779,Okay. What-- What-- what is this?
00:29:16.863,00:29:21.951,It's one of those serendipitous moments in life when three complete strangers share a common thought.
00:29:24.203,00:29:26.122,-Strangers? -Mm-hmm.
00:29:26.372,00:29:29.751,-You don't know each other. -That's generally the definition.
00:29:30.251,00:29:33.171,"Okay, good, but who-- why are you here?"
00:29:33.279,00:29:35.684,Who said that you could stay up in my old goat house?
00:29:35.798,00:29:37.258,-Didn't catch the name. -Greek lady.
00:29:37.342,00:29:38.884,"-Well, she spoke Greek. -Yeah."
00:29:38.968,00:29:41.428,Or maybe she said we couldn't stay in the old goat house.
00:29:41.512,00:29:43.514,"Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek."
00:29:43.598,00:29:45.599,"Yeah, that's it, that's it. You can't stay here."
00:29:45.683,00:29:49.228,"Because I'm, uh, closed. And I'm full."
00:29:49.354,00:29:51.730,"And I'm busy, I'm really-- I have a wedding."
00:29:51.814,00:29:54.525,"My, uh-- Local girl's getting married."
00:29:54.609,00:29:57.611,"Donna. Donna, don't worry about us. Bill here is used to roughing it."
00:29:57.695,00:30:00.948,"-And, um-- -And Harry here-- -I'm spontaneous. -Spontaneous."
00:30:01.032,00:30:02.450,Ah.
00:30:03.701,00:30:07.205,-What about you? -Just wanted to see the island.
00:30:07.997,00:30:09.707,You know what it meant to me.
00:30:12.669,00:30:19.384,"Okay, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna arrange for a boat to take you all back to the mainland."
00:30:19.676,00:30:20.968,"I have a boat, Donna."
00:30:21.052,00:30:22.803,"You have a boat? Good, get on it."
00:30:22.887,00:30:24.388,And anchors away.
00:30:24.472,00:30:26.557,"-Hey! Donna. -Away, away."
00:30:36.109,00:30:38.695,"Now, baby, this should tickle your taste buds."
00:30:39.070,00:30:42.323,"Down, big fella. I'm old enough to be your mother."
00:30:44.826,00:30:47.202,-Where's Sophie? -I think she went down to the beach.
00:30:47.286,00:30:48.538,What's up?
00:30:57.880,00:30:59.382,Donna?
00:31:02.760,00:31:04.846,Sorry. Sorry.
00:31:22.905,00:31:24.866,"Oh, me. Um..."
00:31:48.556,00:31:49.766,This.
00:33:50.469,00:33:52.597,-It's her dad. -Whose dad?
00:33:53.639,00:33:55.016,Sophie's dad.
00:33:57.952,00:33:59.536,Remember how I said it was Sam?
00:33:59.620,00:34:02.582,"Sam, the architect who had to go home to get married?"
00:34:02.707,00:34:07.503,I'm not sure that it was him because there were two other...
00:34:11.966,00:34:14.969,Donna Sheridan. You shady lady.
00:34:15.094,00:34:16.553,Why didn't you tell us?
00:34:16.637,00:34:20.099,"Well, I never knew that I would ever, ever have to."
00:34:20.183,00:34:27.356,I never imagined I'd see all three of them in my old goat house the day before my daughter's wedding.
00:34:36.574,00:34:37.825,Shoot.
00:34:38.743,00:34:40.703,Rosie. Tanya.
00:34:41.829,00:34:43.956,"Wait, wait, wait, don't let them hear you."
00:34:45.917,00:34:47.960,-There's no one here. -Are you sure?
00:34:49.712,00:34:52.048,Do you think I would forget my daughter's dads?
00:34:52.465,00:34:57.970,"They were all here-- Sam Carmichael, Bill Anderson, and Harry Head Banger."
00:35:01.979,00:35:04.227,I hope they run aground and drown.
00:35:04.519,00:35:08.272,What are they doing here? It's like some hideous trick of fate.
00:35:19.033,00:35:20.451,It's very Greek.
00:35:22.870,00:35:24.997,Do they know about Sophie?
00:35:25.248,00:35:28.792,"What are they, psychic? No. I've never told a soul."
00:35:28.876,00:35:32.380,"Oh, Donna, keeping it to yourself all these years."
00:35:32.505,00:35:34.798,It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter about me.
00:35:34.882,00:35:37.009,The only thing that matters...
00:35:37.635,00:35:40.137,is that Sophie never finds out.
00:35:40.471,00:35:42.473,"Well, maybe she would be cool with it."
00:35:47.353,00:35:49.730,You don't know my daughter. This would be like a bombshell.
00:35:49.814,00:35:52.733,"-Donna, they've gone. -I don't know that."
00:35:53.442,00:35:56.737,I don't know where they are. I don't know why they're here.
00:35:57.238,00:36:02.659,"And I have brought this all on myself because I was a stupid, reckless little slut."
00:36:05.246,00:36:07.831,Don't you sound like your mother?
00:36:07.915,00:36:10.793,"-I do not. -Yes, you so do!"
00:36:10.877,00:36:12.169,"Oh, my God, I do not."
00:36:12.253,00:36:13.796,"You do, it's Catholic guilt!"
00:36:13.880,00:36:15.506,You've been living like a nun.
00:36:15.590,00:36:17.842,"Yeah, whatever happened to our Donna?"
00:36:18.092,00:36:20.219,-Life and soul of the party. -Yeah.
00:36:20.303,00:36:22.681,El rock chick supremo?
00:36:24.181,00:36:25.766,I grew up.
00:36:25.850,00:36:27.893,"Well, then, grow back down again."
00:38:14.041,00:38:15.334,Ow!
00:40:24.255,00:40:27.132,"-Wait, wait! Wait! -Hey! Don't leave!"
00:40:27.216,00:40:28.509,Wait!
00:40:32.304,00:40:33.305,Okay.
00:40:33.389,00:40:35.098,"-Whoa, Sophie! -Soph!"
00:40:35.182,00:40:36.725,-Soph! -Sophie!
00:40:41.188,00:40:43.482,We're gonna sail around the island. You wanna come?
00:40:43.899,00:40:46.152,You promised you'd come to my wedding!
00:40:46.318,00:40:49.404,"Yes, well, your mother ejected us from the goat house."
00:40:49.488,00:40:51.699,She thought we'd better get out of her hair.
00:40:51.824,00:40:53.867,Donna freaked out when she saw us.
00:40:53.951,00:40:55.494,What's all that about?
00:40:55.870,00:40:58.705,No. She's just not even thinking straight.
00:40:58.789,00:41:01.374,"She's so stressed about the wedding, you know?"
00:41:01.458,00:41:03.960,But she's got no idea that you're her lovely surprise.
00:41:08.299,00:41:11.760,"-You took Mom's guitar. -No, no. I borrowed it."
00:41:12.011,00:41:14.972,"Look. Now, where is it?"
00:41:15.097,00:41:17.683,D.S. Donna Sheridan.
00:41:17.808,00:41:20.686,And H.B. Head Banger.
00:41:22.897,00:41:27.359,I bought her this. It cost me ten quid plus my Johnny Rotten T-shirt.
00:41:29.153,00:41:30.946,Your mother knew quite a rebel.
00:41:31.071,00:41:33.865,I was studying in Paris when I met her.
00:41:35.659,00:41:39.163,I hopped on a train and followed her to Greece.
00:41:42.583,00:41:44.668,Quite spontaneously.
00:43:39.616,00:43:40.784,Hmm.
00:44:03.724,00:44:05.184,Sophie!
00:44:05.392,00:44:08.103,"Please, I have to go, but please come tomorrow, okay?"
00:44:33.587,00:44:36.256,-Sky. -Where've you been?
00:44:36.673,00:44:38.675,People have been arriving all afternoon.
00:44:38.759,00:44:41.428,"-No one's seen you. -I'm sorry, I was around the island."
00:44:41.512,00:44:44.640,I just-- I just lost track of time.
00:44:46.475,00:44:48.685,-Where're you going? -It's my stag do.
00:44:49.978,00:44:52.648,-My last night of freedom. -Ha!
00:44:53.774,00:45:00.572,"Which is how some people might see it, but for me, it's the last night before the greatest adventure of my life."
00:45:02.825,00:45:05.160,You know how I said I wanted to find my father?
00:45:05.285,00:45:07.620,"Soph, we've been over this a million times."
00:45:07.704,00:45:10.040,You don't need a father. You have a family.
00:45:10.124,00:45:12.709,"-And you'll never leave me, right? -Are you kidding?"
00:45:12.793,00:45:15.504,You have turned my world upside down.
00:47:50.450,00:49:33.344,"presenting, for one night and one night only-- Our song."
00:49:33.428,00:49:36.056,Your song? It's my song.
00:50:26.859,00:50:27.991,"Look, look, look, look, look."
00:51:04.436,00:51:05.937,I can't believe you.
00:51:07.647,00:51:10.233,"Um, excuse me! Hello!"
00:51:10.525,00:51:13.779,This is a hen party. Women only.
00:51:13.987,00:51:15.655,-Thank you. -Okay.
00:51:17.741,00:51:22.788,"Why are they here, then, if it's not to ruin Sophie's wedding?"
00:51:22.996,00:51:25.540,But I thought you weren't so keen on this wedding.
00:51:25.916,00:51:27.626,I don't want them spoiling it.
00:51:27.876,00:51:30.045,They have no right to turn up like this.
00:51:30.253,00:51:32.881,What have they ever done for their daughter? Huh?
00:51:33.048,00:51:35.174,"Donna, Donna, they didn't know she existed."
00:51:35.258,00:51:37.301,"Well, they didn't need to know, did they?"
00:51:37.385,00:51:43.433,"I've done a great job with Soph all by myself, and I won't be muscled out by an... ejaculation."
00:52:06.748,00:52:08.917,"-Hi. -Hi, um..."
00:52:09.584,00:52:12.128,I think I should explain to Donna that I come in peace.
00:52:12.337,00:52:13.713,"Oh, no, really. You should wait."
00:52:13.797,00:52:16.299,You should wait until she has a few drinks in her first.
00:52:16.383,00:52:18.176,-Really. -Good idea. Good idea.
00:52:18.260,00:52:21.221,"Um, what you drew on the boat..."
00:52:22.430,00:52:24.808,this is good. This is really good.
00:52:25.141,00:52:28.478,Why don't you pursue this? You have a real talent here.
00:52:29.604,00:52:31.106,I have enough to do here.
00:52:31.481,00:52:33.525,Is that really your dream?
00:52:33.859,00:52:37.737,-Running the villa with Donna? -She just can't do it by herself.
00:52:40.448,00:52:45.495,"Do you know, I drew this whole place up on the back of a menu one night."
00:52:46.079,00:52:49.124,-I always dreamt I'd come back here. -What kept you?
00:52:50.000,00:52:53.086,-What's your mother said about me? -She never mentioned you.
00:52:53.837,00:52:55.046,Sophie...
00:52:56.840,00:52:58.300,What am I doing here?
00:53:04.931,00:53:07.475,Somebody up there has got it in for me.
00:53:07.642,00:53:08.893,I bet it's my mother.
00:53:08.977,00:53:10.770,"Oh, and wasn't she a ray of sunshine."
00:53:10.854,00:53:12.980,I'm gonna go get them out of here.
00:53:13.064,00:53:14.899,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
00:53:14.983,00:53:18.069,"You go in there guns loaded, there's gonna be questions."
00:53:18.153,00:53:20.154,"-Help me out of these boots. -Come on, then."
00:53:20.238,00:53:22.782,All that fricking yoga's made my feet bigger.
00:53:22.866,00:53:30.749,"Now, listen, listen, what we're gonna do is, ...and then tomorrow, Tanya and I..."
00:53:31.374,00:53:33.126,will take them fishing.
00:53:33.251,00:53:35.712,"Fishing?! Oh, please!"
00:53:36.087,00:53:38.632,What do you suggest we do with three men?
00:53:55.941,00:53:57.484,-Hi. -Hello.
00:53:57.943,00:54:00.111,-You okay? -I'm fine.
00:54:03.448,00:54:05.408,Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter.
00:54:06.409,00:54:08.286,"Do you have any children, Harry?"
00:54:08.870,00:54:10.997,"Well, I have the dogs, Lucy and Kipper."
00:54:11.081,00:54:13.249,That's the extent of my relationships.
00:54:13.667,00:54:16.002,I'd have loved a daughter. I'd have spoiled her rotten.
00:54:20.131,00:54:22.509,-Is your father here? -I don't know.
00:54:25.553,00:54:27.639,I don't know who my father is.
00:54:34.771,00:54:38.108,Hey! This is fantastic!
00:54:40.360,00:54:43.530,How on Earth did Donna get money to buy this place?
00:54:43.822,00:54:47.909,She was left some money by the old lady she looked after when I was little.
00:54:48.743,00:54:51.913,"-Sofia, that I'm named after. -My great-aunt Sofia?"
00:54:52.414,00:54:53.623,I guess.
00:54:54.374,00:54:56.806,I always heard her money was left to family.
00:55:04.426,00:55:05.677,How old are you?
00:55:10.515,00:55:11.808,Will you excuse me a minute?
00:55:15.812,00:55:17.105,I'm sorry!
00:55:20.608,00:55:22.027,Bill.
00:55:23.445,00:55:24.696,"Bill, wait."
00:55:25.530,00:55:27.949,Why did your great-aunt leave my mother money?
00:55:28.158,00:55:29.576,I don't know.
00:55:29.909,00:55:34.831,"All my life, there's been this huge unanswered question, and I don't want any more secrecy."
00:55:35.123,00:55:37.792,"-What do you want from me? -Bill, please!"
00:55:42.505,00:55:43.882,Are you my father?
00:55:45.008,00:55:47.677,"Yes, I think so."
00:55:50.346,00:55:51.431,Yes.
00:55:52.724,00:55:53.767,You know what comes next?
00:55:54.559,00:55:57.395,"You're not going to tell me that you have a twin sister, are you?"
00:56:00.440,00:56:02.442,Will you give me away tomorrow?
00:56:02.692,00:56:05.570,-Give you away? -No. Our secret until the wedding.
00:56:15.163,00:56:16.456,"Oh, God."
00:56:19.667,00:56:21.002,Okay.
00:56:23.671,00:56:24.881,Whoo!
00:57:36.619,00:57:37.912,Go dance with Mom!
00:57:40.748,00:57:42.667,"Sophie, come here."
00:57:43.251,00:57:46.713,I know why I'm here. Why didn't Donna tell me?
00:57:46.838,00:57:49.174,How long have you known I'm your father?
00:57:49.382,00:57:50.800,What?!
00:57:51.301,00:57:54.554,"Not long at all. Sam, listen to me."
00:57:55.013,00:57:59.475,My mom doesn't know that I know. So can we wait until after my wedding?
00:57:59.559,00:58:01.685,-Who's giving you away tomorrow? -Nobody.
00:58:01.769,00:58:04.981,Wrong. I am. Our secret till then.
00:58:12.322,00:58:13.907,Are you okay?
00:58:15.116,00:58:16.409,I can't breathe!
00:58:28.880,00:58:30.048,"Oh, my God."
00:58:32.050,00:58:33.467,-I'm your father! -Harry!
00:58:33.551,00:58:35.302,"Now, that's why you sent me the invite!"
00:58:35.386,00:58:38.514,You wanted your old dad to walk you down the aisle!
00:58:38.598,00:58:41.351,"Well, I won't let you down. I'll be there!"
00:59:07.532,00:59:09.545,-...my world upside down... -How old are you?!
00:59:09.671,00:59:11.380,Fancy Donna having a grown-up daughter...
00:59:11.464,00:59:13.257,How long have you known I'm your father...
00:59:13.341,00:59:15.718,"-I'm your father! -Oh, my God!"
00:59:15.802,00:59:17.971,Who's giving you away tomorrow?
00:59:18.513,00:59:20.095,-Sophie! -Soph!
00:59:29.148,00:59:32.110,"Come on, mother, rise and shine."
00:59:32.235,00:59:34.529,I was tossing and turning all night.
00:59:34.988,00:59:38.073,Those three guys are still loose on this island.
00:59:38.157,00:59:39.366,We got to do something.
00:59:39.450,00:59:40.743,Donna. Donna. Donna Donna. Donna.
00:59:40.827,00:59:42.786,It's all under control.
00:59:42.870,00:59:44.663,I have been tossing and turning all night.
00:59:44.747,00:59:48.701,"I've got three dads coming to my wedding, and I have to tell two of them they're surplus."
00:59:48.797,00:59:50.836,"-Only, which two? -It's all under control."
00:59:50.920,00:59:52.880,I'm taking Bill and Sam fishing...
00:59:52.964,00:59:55.090,We're each gonna go off. We're gonna grab a man.
00:59:55.174,00:59:57.468,"interrogate him, swap notes and decide."
00:59:57.719,01:00:00.179,And Harry's talked Tanya into water sports.
01:00:01.764,01:00:05.310,"Oh, God. Nurse! Donkey testicles, quickly!"
01:00:28.458,01:00:32.837,"-No, after you. -No, no, you go-- -No. No. Please. -No, no, no, no, you first."
01:00:34.589,01:00:37.258,"-I want to get something off my chest. -Me, too."
01:00:45.433,01:00:47.977,"Last night, I discovered something wonderful."
01:00:48.978,01:00:54.484,"It was a wake-up call, a way to look at myself and what I really want out of life."
01:01:01.741,01:01:07.580,"You didn't even-- even suspect that you were-- Well, no, of course not. That's always been a secret."
01:01:08.081,01:01:09.207,Oh.
01:01:10.416,01:01:12.751,And now we... say it out loud.
01:01:12.835,01:01:15.171,No. No. No. It's absolutely hush-hush.
01:01:15.296,01:01:16.672,"I mean, for now."
01:01:16.839,01:01:18.841,All will be revealed tonight.
01:01:26.939,01:01:28.351,I think I know what's going on.
01:01:31.896,01:01:34.816,I saw it from the moment you clapped eyes on each other.
01:01:37.985,01:01:42.573,"Well, I'm gonna level with you, Harry. I-- I don't think I can do this."
01:01:43.408,01:01:45.660,"Well, she's a wonderful girl, but..."
01:01:46.411,01:01:48.579,can I take her on in my life?
01:01:48.996,01:01:51.749,"Bill, where's your spontaneity?"
01:01:52.333,01:01:53.751,It's this...
01:01:55.086,01:01:56.712,"this family, you know?"
01:01:57.547,01:02:00.216,-You don't have to marry her. -What?!
01:02:02.677,01:02:05.263,"Hey, right in time for breakfast!"
01:02:05.513,01:02:07.473,We're serving up the works here.
01:02:08.474,01:02:09.934,Oh. Think you just did.
01:02:10.143,01:02:11.978,Sunny-side up! Lox or ham?
01:02:12.186,01:02:15.148,"I'll just, uh-- Uh..."
01:02:15.731,01:02:17.066,just gonna...
01:02:19.402,01:02:22.321,Ugh! What a mess.
01:02:24.907,01:02:27.118,-Hey. -Huh? What?
01:02:27.743,01:02:30.204,-You okay? -Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.
01:02:30.288,01:02:32.248,"-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sophie. -What?"
01:02:34.417,01:02:37.211,"Last night, you-- you and Sky."
01:02:37.295,01:02:41.007,What's wrong? Mm? Tell me.
01:02:41.424,01:02:42.842,Tell me what's wrong.
01:02:47.346,01:02:50.558,-I don't know what to do. -You know what to do.
01:02:53.978,01:02:55.646,You don't have to do anything.
01:02:58.399,01:03:00.943,Not too late. I can still call off the wedding.
01:03:01.027,01:03:04.322,-Everybody will understand. -C-- Call off the wedding?
01:03:04.989,01:03:06.908,-Isn't that what you want? -No.
01:03:07.742,01:03:09.160,No!
01:03:10.244,01:03:12.205,"No, that's what you want."
01:03:12.455,01:03:14.874,-No. Sophie! -Yes! God.
01:03:15.208,01:03:19.086,You just-- you have no idea! You never had a wedding.
01:03:19.212,01:03:21.004,You never did the marriage-and-babies thing.
01:03:21.088,01:03:23.257,"You just did the baby thing. Well, good for you!"
01:03:23.341,01:03:26.093,"You know, I don't know why you're going off on me now."
01:03:26.302,01:03:27.636,-I really don't! -Because!
01:03:27.720,01:03:29.972,"Because I-- God, I love Sky!"
01:03:30.056,01:03:31.890,-And I want to be with him. -Good! Great.
01:03:31.974,01:03:36.145,And I don't want my children growing up not knowing who their father is.
01:03:36.229,01:03:38.314,Because it's just-- it's crap!
01:03:42.985,01:03:45.946,"What are you doing? Stop, you're terrible."
01:03:46.030,01:03:47.990,"Come on, man. What are you talking about?"
01:03:48.074,01:03:50.785,"Okay, okay, Sophie's gonna have an absolutely beautiful wedding."
01:03:51.327,01:03:52.494,Right?
01:03:52.578,01:03:54.664,You're supposed to be helping me!
01:03:54.830,01:03:57.250,You guys-- he's got to get ready!
01:04:05.716,01:04:07.552,I see you kept my bagpipes.
01:04:10.805,01:04:13.224,They're supposed to ward off unwanted visitors.
01:04:15.768,01:04:18.062,"Well, you don't need bagpipes to do that."
01:04:19.438,01:04:21.566,"What are you doing here, Sam?"
01:04:22.024,01:04:24.068,"This is our dream, remember?"
01:04:25.653,01:04:29.240,"-Villa on the island? -Yeah. Well, this is my reality."
01:04:29.699,01:04:31.867,Hard work and a crippling mortgage.
01:04:32.118,01:04:33.452,Shoot.
01:04:33.911,01:04:37.090,And a hotel that's crumbling around me.
01:04:37.195,01:04:39.208,"Look, I'll help. Let me have a look at this."
01:04:39.292,01:04:43.462,"No, that's all right. I can deal my own disasters."
01:04:43.754,01:04:46.257,Why didn't you tell me it was Sophie getting married?
01:04:46.499,01:04:48.305,I didn't think it was any of your business.
01:04:48.399,01:04:50.520,Why she's getting married? Settling down on the island?
01:04:50.604,01:04:53.804,"I mean, if it was up to me, I'd tell her to go get a life."
01:04:54.004,01:04:55.516,-Yeah. -She's a bright kid.
01:04:55.683,01:04:57.685,I know. I know.
01:04:58.144,01:05:01.146,"But, you know, my daughter has a mind of her own."
01:05:01.230,01:05:03.107,"Oh, yeah, I see that."
01:05:04.817,01:05:06.152,I see that.
01:05:07.028,01:05:09.030,-But she's so young. -I know.
01:05:09.363,01:05:11.490,"I mean, does she know what she really wants?"
01:05:11.574,01:05:16.954,"You see, I think part of her just wants to let you know that she isn't gonna leave you alone here, on your own."
01:05:17.038,01:05:18.039,Mm-hmm.
01:05:20.082,01:05:21.375,What do you mean?
01:05:21.459,01:05:24.670,"Donna, look. I have two grown children."
01:05:24.754,01:05:26.296,I know something about letting go.
01:05:26.380,01:05:30.926,"-Oh. -If Sophie felt you were okay on your own, would she want something different for herself?"
01:05:31.052,01:05:32.887,"Okay, here's the thing."
01:05:33.304,01:05:36.640,"I love being on my own. I really do, you know?"
01:05:36.724,01:05:42.771,"Every morning, I get up and I thank God that I don't have some middle-aged, menopausal man telling me how to run my life."
01:05:42.855,01:05:45.608,You know? I'm free and I'm single.
01:05:48.319,01:05:49.737,it's great.
01:08:07.041,01:08:09.835,"Donna must be tearing her hair out, doing this wedding on her own."
01:08:10.211,01:08:13.047,What would the father of the bride normally do?
01:08:13.380,01:08:14.757,Pay.
01:08:15.299,01:08:17.843,Though my dad drew the line at my third.
01:08:18.052,01:08:19.386,I see.
01:08:20.513,01:08:23.015,-Excuse me. -Harry?
01:08:26.310,01:08:27.728,Harry!
01:08:28.229,01:08:29.563,Tanya?
01:08:30.481,01:08:32.900,Let's pick up where we left off last night.
01:08:33.275,01:08:38.155,Last night never happened. I've drawn a veil over last night.
01:08:38.614,01:08:41.283,"Oh, my God, look at the time. I've got work to do."
01:08:41.408,01:08:43.994,-Work? -A little repair and renovation!
01:08:44.078,01:08:45.371,Come on.
01:08:45.496,01:08:47.831,You don't mess with a masterpiece.
01:08:47.915,01:08:50.834,"Oh, ignore him, Tanya, he's all mouth and no trousers."
01:08:50.918,01:08:53.253,Tanya can't ignore the chemistry between us.
01:08:53.337,01:08:56.966,Little boys who play with fire get their fingers burned.
01:09:12.523,01:09:13.648,Whoa!
01:10:08.871,01:10:10.372,"Come on, boys!"
01:11:30.285,01:11:32.788,Boy down. Boy down.
01:11:33.247,01:11:37.001,"Yo, girls. We done good."
01:11:38.043,01:11:40.879,"Yes, any color, doesn't matter. There's no plan."
01:11:40.963,01:11:43.924,"God knows there's no plan. It looks great, though."
01:11:44.091,01:11:45.842,"Ella, Donna, where would you like this?"
01:11:45.926,01:11:48.261,"Carlos, get the meat out of the heat."
01:11:48.345,01:11:50.221,Put a cover on that thing. That's beautiful.
01:11:50.305,01:11:54.059,"And tell-- Ione, help him get the-- -Harry, what are you doing here? -Hello."
01:11:54.143,01:11:57.354,"I, uh-- I just wanted to give you this."
01:11:57.604,01:12:01.942,"I don't mean here, here. I mean, why are you on this..."
01:12:02.401,01:12:06.113,-I realized-- -...island? What is this?!
01:12:06.363,01:12:15.164,"Now, I realized you've had to tighten your belt a bit over the years bringing up Sophie on your own, and I just wanted to make a small contribution to the wedding."
01:12:19.668,01:12:21.461,"-I can't, uh, accept this. -No."
01:12:21.545,01:12:23.171,-I can't-- -No! No!
01:12:23.255,01:12:24.798,"-Harry, I ca-- Harry? -No. No."
01:12:24.882,01:12:27.009,"No, you'll have to catch me first."
01:12:27.509,01:12:30.095,"-Ah, you're all just jealous. -Sky."
01:12:30.596,01:12:32.973,-What's the matter? -You have to help me.
01:12:33.182,01:12:35.642,"Why, what's happened? Baby?"
01:12:37.352,01:12:38.729,Sophie!
01:12:39.480,01:12:40.731,Soph.
01:12:42.483,01:12:44.526,I've done something completely insane.
01:12:45.444,01:12:48.571,All my dads are here for our wedding. They all think they're giving me away.
01:12:48.655,01:12:49.907,All your what?
01:12:51.366,01:12:55.829,"I read Mom's diary, and I have three possible fathers."
01:12:57.081,01:12:58.791,But how are they here now?
01:12:59.500,01:13:00.709,I invited them.
01:13:02.920,01:13:04.921,I thought that I would know my dad right away.
01:13:05.005,01:13:07.590,But I didn't. I just-- I have no idea.
01:13:07.674,01:13:11.970,"And now my mom is gonna kill me, -and they're gonna hate me and you-- -Hold on. Hold on."
01:13:12.054,01:13:14.014,You invited these guys and you didn't tell me?
01:13:14.098,01:13:16.308,"No, I thought you would try to stop me."
01:13:18.185,01:13:19.728,-I know I messed up! -Sophie.
01:13:21.855,01:13:24.357,Is that what this whole big white wedding is about?
01:13:24.441,01:13:26.904,-You finding your dad? -No. No.
01:13:26.988,01:13:32.699,"I wanted to take a boat to the mainland with a couple of witnesses, and you insisted on this sodding circus so you could play happy family."
01:13:32.783,01:13:36.244,It's about knowing who I am! I wanted to get married knowing who I am.
01:13:36.328,01:13:38.455,That doesn't come from finding your father.
01:13:39.164,01:13:40.957,That comes from finding yourself.
01:13:41.041,01:13:45.921,"And... the irony is, I was traveling to find myself."
01:13:47.881,01:13:50.384,"I put everything on hold, for you."
01:13:52.427,01:13:55.013,Because I loved you and I wanted what you wanted.
01:13:55.222,01:13:58.559,"-Now, I don't know. -You don't know if you love me?"
01:13:58.684,01:14:01.270,Of course I love you! I just wish you'd told me!
01:14:03.397,01:14:05.190,Is everything okay?
01:14:06.024,01:14:07.317,"Sophie, what's wrong?"
01:14:07.401,01:14:11.654,"-Not now, Sam. -Yes, yes, yes, now because I'm supposed to be giving you away."
01:14:11.738,01:14:14.157,How can I when I know you're not really gonna be happy?
01:14:14.241,01:14:22.874,"I heard this from my mother. I think she knows me better - than you do. -I know, but I've done the big white wedding, and believe me, it doesn't always end -in happy ever after. -That is you!"
01:14:22.958,01:14:24.542,"That's not me, okay?"
01:14:24.626,01:14:34.094,"I love Sky more than anything in the world, and I-- No."
01:14:50.777,01:14:53.447,"Hey, aren't you supposed to be getting dressed?"
01:14:53.739,01:14:56.325,Where's Ali and Lisa? I thought they were gonna help you.
01:14:57.034,01:14:58.785,Will you help me?
01:15:00.120,01:15:01.455,Mm-hmm.
01:15:03.498,01:15:06.793,"Wait. It's okay, it's okay."
01:15:07.336,01:15:09.129,We have time.
01:18:05.722,01:18:07.307,Do you think I'm letting you down?
01:18:10.060,01:18:12.562,Why would you even think that?
01:18:12.813,01:18:15.732,"Well, because... of what you've done."
01:18:15.816,01:18:21.404,"I mean, the Dynamos, raising a kid, and running a business all on your own."
01:18:21.488,01:18:24.574,"Well, honey, I didn't have a choice."
01:18:24.658,01:18:27.661,"I couldn't go home, you know."
01:18:29.162,01:18:34.251,"When I got pregnant, my mother told me not to bother coming back."
01:18:36.837,01:18:39.464,And I wouldn't have had it any other way.
01:18:39.548,01:18:41.967,"My God, look at what we've had."
01:18:46.847,01:18:48.390,Will you give me away?
01:18:58.567,01:18:59.734,Yeah.
01:20:15.435,01:20:16.853,Donna.
01:20:17.354,01:20:20.231,"Donna, I need to talk to you about who's giving Sophie away."
01:20:20.315,01:20:22.234,-That would be me. -But...
01:20:22.359,01:20:24.986,-what about her dad? -Her dad isn't here.
01:20:25.070,01:20:28.906,It's what she wants. She told me she wants her father here.
01:20:28.990,01:20:30.908,"What if her father wants that, too?"
01:20:30.992,01:20:33.370,"What? Sam, don't do this now."
01:20:33.578,01:20:36.789,I can't... hear this now.
01:20:36.873,01:20:40.710,"Donna, listen to me. This is about us."
01:25:01.971,01:25:03.765,Donna!
01:25:33.419,01:25:35.839,"Donna, there you are."
01:25:36.214,01:25:38.299,-It's okay. -They're my best shoes.
01:25:38.550,01:25:40.926,-Panic over. Here she is. -She's here.
01:26:39.986,01:26:46.242,Welcome to Sophie and Sky and to all your friends who have gathered together this evening.
01:26:46.326,01:26:50.246,"And welcome, especially, to Donna, who represents your family."
01:26:50.330,01:26:55.126,We are all here together in this glorious-- And welcome to...
01:26:56.127,01:26:57.503,to...
01:26:57.754,01:26:59.380,Sophie's dad.
01:27:00.256,01:27:02.342,I have to tell you. He is here.
01:27:02.508,01:27:03.843,I know. I invited him.
01:27:06.012,01:27:08.181,You couldn't have. I don't know which one it is.
01:27:11.476,01:27:13.019,"Oh, my God!"
01:27:13.811,01:27:20.109,"-That's why they're all here. -I'm sorry. Sorry. I just-- Please, please forgive me! Please forgive me."
01:27:20.193,01:27:22.236,-Please. -I don't know.
01:27:25.198,01:27:28.076,-Can you forgive me? -What?
01:27:28.534,01:27:32.163,I don't care if you slept with hundreds of men.
01:27:33.665,01:27:36.876,You're my mom. And I love you so much.
01:27:43.716,01:27:46.803,And I haven't slept with hundreds of men.
01:27:50.765,01:27:52.892,Am I getting this right?
01:27:54.060,01:28:05.487,"Sophie may be mine, And don't get all self-righteous with me, because you have no one but yourself to blame."
01:28:05.571,01:28:11.119,"Yeah, if you hadn't just dumped my mother and gone off -and married somebody else. -Hey, hey, wait a minute."
01:28:11.619,01:28:14.163,"I had to go home, I was engaged."
01:28:14.288,01:28:17.542,but I told Lorraine I couldn't marry her and I came right back.
01:28:21.462,01:28:23.881,You... you...
01:28:24.716,01:28:32.765,"-Why didn't you call me? -Because I was crazy enough to think that you would be waiting for me. Only when I arrived, they told me you were off with some other guy."
01:28:35.184,01:28:39.564,"So, Lorraine called me an idiot and married me to prove it."
01:28:39.731,01:28:41.565,"Sorry, can I just-- might I just butt in?"
01:28:41.649,01:28:45.903,"No, Harry, don't. It's all right. You don't have to-- No, no, I just wanted to say it's great..."
01:28:46.320,01:28:48.697,to have even a third of Sophie.
01:28:48.781,01:28:51.325,I never thought I'd get even that much of a child.
01:28:52.285,01:28:54.954,"Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved."
01:28:56.080,01:28:58.291,"Actually, you were the last girl I ever loved."
01:29:00.835,01:29:03.921,"Now, this gives me an excuse to come here much more often."
01:29:04.130,01:29:06.799,We can find out if you want.
01:29:07.383,01:29:09.677,But I'm with Harry.
01:29:10.428,01:29:12.555,Being a third of your dad is great by me.
01:29:15.767,01:29:19.937,"Typical, isn't it? You wait 20 years for a dad and then three come along at once."
01:29:24.067,01:29:31.157,"Dearly beloved-- You know, I have no clue which one of you is my dad, but I don't mind."
01:29:31.949,01:29:34.118,"Now, I know what I really want."
01:29:34.911,01:29:36.578,"Sky, let's just not get married yet."
01:29:39.916,01:29:42.710,You never wanted this anyway. I know that.
01:29:42.794,01:29:46.881,Let's just get off this island and see the world. Okay? All right?
01:29:47.006,01:29:48.674,I love you.
01:29:55.515,01:29:59.018,"Donna, do I take it the wedding is canceled?"
01:29:59.435,01:30:01.979,I'm not entirely sure what's happening right now.
01:30:02.105,01:30:03.397,Hang on.
01:30:06.275,01:30:08.027,Why waste a good wedding?
01:30:10.404,01:30:12.156,"How about it, Sheridan?"
01:30:12.907,01:30:15.701,You're going to need someone to boss around on this island of yours.
01:30:17.912,01:30:19.497,Are you nuts?
01:30:20.164,01:30:23.668,-I am not a bigamist. -Neither am I.
01:30:23.876,01:30:27.588,I'm a divorced man who's loved you for 21 years.
01:30:29.090,01:30:34.679,"And ever since the day I set foot on this island, I've been trying to tell you how much I love you."
01:30:42.979,01:30:44.730,"Come on, Donna."
01:30:45.898,01:30:47.775,It's only the rest of your life.
01:31:02.123,01:31:03.415,"Oh, yeah."
01:31:24.604,01:31:27.087,"I do, I do."
01:31:35.031,01:31:36.866,"Oh, yeah!"
01:31:37.742,01:31:41.621,I now pronounce you man and wife.
01:31:50.588,01:31:52.548,-Are you happy?! -So happy!
01:34:09.894,01:34:13.105,That's not for me. I'm a writer.
01:34:14.231,01:34:15.816,Lone wolf.
01:34:33.584,01:34:34.835,Honey...
01:34:42.551,01:34:43.719,Sorry.
01:34:57.233,01:34:58.609,Speech!
01:35:00.277,01:35:02.154,"I'm gonna make a speech, everybody."
01:35:02.446,01:35:03.781,"Yeah, get ready."
01:41:13.150,01:41:16.152,-Whoo! -That's it!
01:41:16.236,01:41:18.321,-Bye! -Bye.
01:41:21.325,01:41:25.537,Want another one? Do you want another one?!
01:41:26.121,01:41:28.123,Do you want another one?!
01:41:28.373,01:41:30.250,-Let's give it to them. -You want another one?!
01:41:30.375,01:41:31.668,Let's rip it up.
