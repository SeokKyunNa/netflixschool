00:49:07.819,00:49:11.531,"You've been very secretive about how you vote, what you're voting for."
01:17:20.385,01:17:22.721,"You were really major at midterms, honey."
00:00:43.460,00:00:46.963,This is the first one that I started when I was 13.
00:00:49.382,00:01:00.143,"My life, my career, my-- my dream… For a while, I wrote with quill and ink."
00:01:00.226,00:01:04.689,"That was a phase I went through. Like, I had a glass quill with, like, an ink jet."
00:01:07.525,00:01:15.658,"You know, my entire moral code, as a kid and now, is a need to be thought of as good."
00:01:15.992,00:01:18.828,That's dangerous. That's not-- That's dangerous for you.
00:01:20.246,00:01:23.083,It was all I wrote about. It was all I wanted.
00:01:23.166,00:01:28.088,It was the complete and total… belief system that I subscribed to as a kid.
00:01:30.006,00:01:31.382,Do the right thing.
00:01:31.466,00:01:32.926,Do the good thing.
00:01:33.009,00:01:46.356,"And obviously, I'm not a perfect person by any stretch, but overall, the main thing that I always tried to be was… um… like, just… like, a good girl."
00:01:54.030,00:01:57.617,"a multitalented performing artist from Reading, Pennsylvania."
00:01:58.618,00:02:00.703,Please welcome Taylor Swift!
00:02:06.751,00:02:13.299,"one of my first memories of country music was when I was six years old, and my parents took me to see LeAnn Rimes in concert."
00:02:19.013,00:02:19.931,happy!
00:02:32.235,00:02:35.989,"See, that's-- that's Sony Music, right there."
00:02:46.457,00:02:50.044,"Hey, this is Taylor Swift, and thanks for listening to Cat Country 98.1."
00:02:52.755,00:02:54.716,You're doing a good job at being a musician.
00:02:55.008,00:02:58.219,"Like, those pats on the head were all I lived for."
00:02:58.303,00:03:02.557,"No one's going to be watching this 'cause it's my home video, but… right here, look at that."
00:03:02.640,00:03:39.052,Look at that. Sixty… that… that was it.
00:05:44.594,00:05:52.769,I'm so… Everybody was so happy watching it.
00:06:37.772,00:06:49.409,"I've just been, like, running up and down stairs, like, moving things around, unpacking boxes, like… …trying not to think about you calling me with Grammy nominations."
00:06:52.745,00:06:54.080,the full list.
00:06:54.163,00:07:03.756,"Because right now, um, in the main… the big categories of album, record, song… um, you are not nominated."
00:07:07.009,00:07:18.729,"-And-- -Uh, okay, it's-- it's, um… Everything is like this cr-- You know, it's so weird, I said-- If-- This is… You know what? Like, this is fine."
00:07:20.064,00:07:21.899,I just need to make a better record.
00:07:25.570,00:07:27.864,"No, I'm making… I'm making a better record."
00:07:31.117,00:07:33.995,"I'm still waiting for the pop… you know, the pop categories."
00:07:34.078,00:07:36.038,Those should be hitting any second.
00:07:37.915,00:07:40.293,"So, do you want me to call you right back when those hit?"
00:07:41.002,00:07:41.961,Sure.
00:08:51.572,00:09:32.780,"And I guess it's, like… The only thing I have-- I really have minimal stuff, but it's like… And, like… First verse, and, like, maybe a lower volume so you can hear -what lyrics I'm trying to say. -Yeah."
00:10:05.271,00:10:06.397,-Damn. -Holy shit!
00:10:06.480,00:10:09.567,"Oh, my God, did we just do, like, this whole verse and chorus?"
00:10:11.235,00:10:12.069,Holy shit.
00:10:24.290,00:10:25.541,This means it's working.
00:10:39.930,00:10:47.021,"If I don't beat everything I've done prior, it'll be deemed as, like, a colossal failure."
00:10:47.647,00:10:51.776,"Maybe first I could talk to you about, um, kind of new album stuff."
00:10:52.234,00:11:00.034,There's gonna be from… from 16 to 20 songs on it… is what I'm guessing it's gonna end up at.
00:11:02.912,00:11:04.664,That's what-- that's what I was hoping for.
00:11:18.177,00:11:24.892,"niche specialty thing that they do… that, you know, sets them apart from everybody else."
00:11:26.060,00:11:29.980,And… my storytelling is what it is for me.
00:11:30.064,00:11:35.611,"I-I… I know that, without me writing my own songs, I wouldn't… be here."
00:11:54.714,00:11:56.674,where we feel like we grew up together.
00:11:56.966,00:12:05.015,"I'll-- I'll be going through something, write the album about it, and then it'll come out, and… sometimes it'll just coincide with what they're going through."
00:12:05.474,00:12:08.978,Kind of… Kind of like they're reading my diary.
00:12:30.332,00:12:31.167,Okay.
00:12:32.877,00:12:38.716,"This is a song I wrote yesterday, and… it's about a girl who's just different."
00:12:39.508,00:12:43.637,And I really like it because it's just s-so happy.
00:13:09.121,00:13:13.667,"I have to be honest with you, this song was seriously finished five minutes ago."
00:13:13.751,00:13:47.451,"So, you know, I usually have these things memorized, but… I just finished it five minutes ago, so… I started playing guitar and wrote a couple songs, and I've written 150 songs and written every song on this album, so… I actually came up with the concept for it in math class my freshman year."
00:13:47.535,00:13:50.412,"You know, I've had a single out now for about a month."
00:13:54.959,00:14:03.968,I want each and every one of you to call 'em up… and tell 'em you wanna hear a song called Tim McGraw by this girl named Taylor Swift.
00:14:19.775,00:14:25.447,A 16-year-old girl released her debut country music album and dreamed of making it big.
00:14:25.531,00:14:28.868,"Well, today that girl is as big as it gets."
00:14:28.951,00:14:33.289,"In the past year, she has taken Nashville and country music on an unforgettable trip around the world."
00:14:38.168,00:14:40.629,to write and perform a number one country song.
00:14:40.713,00:14:44.008,"I give myself, like, five seconds a day to be like, Yes, this is happening!"
00:14:45.968,00:14:48.095,I'm trying to figure out how I'm gonna make it last.
00:14:51.891,00:14:53.100,Taylor Swift!
00:15:01.525,00:15:05.070,and my family for moving to Nashville so that I could do this.
00:15:06.322,00:15:18.208,And the fans… Thank you so much.
00:15:33.557,00:15:37.770,"a very spectacle-type live show, and I remember thinking, This feels like a dream."
00:15:37.853,00:15:39.897,This feels like a dream. This feels like a dream.
00:15:50.616,00:15:58.791,"and that is where you derive all of your joy and fulfillment, one bad thing can cause everything to crumble."
00:16:03.587,00:16:05.714,as angelic and as beautiful as this.
00:16:05.798,00:16:08.968,"Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Taylor Swift."
00:16:13.389,00:16:21.105,And the Moonman for Best Female Video goes to… Taylor Swift.
00:16:35.911,00:16:42.251,"I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these someday, but I never actually thought that would happen."
00:16:42.668,00:16:59.101,"Uh, I sing country music, so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a VMA Award, I… Yo, Taylor… I-I'm really happy for you. I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time!"
00:17:17.953,00:17:24.960,"and I was really excited because I had just won the award, and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on the stage."
00:17:25.044,00:17:28.714,"And then I, um… then I wasn't so excited anymore."
00:17:37.556,00:17:49.151,"I-I don't know him, and I-I've never met him, so… Are you still a fan? I take it no?"
00:17:49.318,00:17:54.865,"You know, I just… I don't know him, and I don't wanna start anything 'cause I just, you know, I had a great night tonight."
00:17:54.948,00:17:57.618,"Everyone is talking about this Kanye West thing, aren't they?"
00:17:57.701,00:18:06.585,"In case you're lucky enough to have missed it, Kanye West interrupted a young singer named Taylor Swift while she… President Obama calling Kanye West a jackass."
00:18:06.668,00:18:11.590,I can name you ten or 15 people that he wouldn't have gone up and taken that mic away from.
00:18:11.673,00:18:14.551,But he did it with a 17-year-old girl because he could.
00:18:23.727,00:18:26.522,"At the time, I didn't know they were booing him doing that."
00:18:27.022,00:18:28.774,I thought that they were booing me.
00:18:29.483,00:18:42.287,"For someone who's built their whole belief system on getting people to clap for you, the whole crowd booing… is a pretty… formative experience."
00:19:11.441,00:19:16.071,for a lot of psychological… paths that I went down.
00:19:19.616,00:19:22.661,And not all of them were… beneficial.
00:19:32.713,00:19:36.008,I'm only here because I work hard and I'm nice to people.
00:19:46.810,00:19:49.021,but I can control what I write.
00:20:17.132,00:20:19.218,"where I was like, I'm gonna prove myself."
00:20:19.301,00:20:22.221,I'm gonna make sure people know I deserve to be here.
00:20:25.599,00:20:34.066,"with almost no contemporary references, Miss Swift is aiming somewhere even higher, a mode of timelessness few pop stars even bother aspiring to."
00:20:35.651,00:20:44.868,Taylor Swift has done something only The Beatles have done: an album at number one for six weeks for four consecutive albums.
00:20:48.080,00:20:51.625,Taylor Swift is the music industry.
00:21:40.173,00:21:42.467,My life had never been better.
00:21:51.601,00:21:53.603,which I never thought was a possibility.
00:21:54.604,00:22:01.528,"And I remembered thinking afterward… Oh, my God, that was all you wanted."
00:22:03.071,00:22:04.990,"Oh, God, that was all you wanted."
00:22:05.073,00:22:06.742,That was all you focused on.
00:22:07.451,00:22:13.123,"You get to the mountaintop and you look around, and you're like, Oh, God. W-What now?"
00:22:14.249,00:22:30.140,I want to thank the fans for the last ten years… and the Recording Academy… I-I didn't have anyone I could talk to who could relate to what I was-- what-- what I-- you know?
00:22:31.391,00:22:44.404,"I had my mom, but… I just wondered… Shouldn't-- shouldn't I… shouldn't I have someone that I could call right now?"
00:23:06.259,00:23:10.305,"Um, I didn't ever eat burritos until, like, two years ago."
00:23:11.348,00:23:13.392,I had never tri-- I just had never tried one.
00:23:25.612,00:23:27.280,-For crunch? -No.
00:23:32.869,00:23:34.162,I'm about to be 29.
00:23:42.462,00:23:43.672,How do you feel about that?
00:23:46.383,00:23:56.309,"yeah, there's a part of me that feels like I'm 57, but there's a part of me that's like… definitely not ready to have kids, definitely not ready for all this grown-up stuff."
00:24:07.696,00:24:15.829,"…figuring stuff out because my life is planned, like, in… Like, literally, in two months, they'll come to me with the dates for the next tour."
00:24:18.039,00:24:22.794,"you'll be at Foxborough Stadium, this date, 2020, or whatever year, you know?"
00:24:30.969,00:24:33.472,Ooh! You scared the shit out of me!
00:24:42.564,00:24:43.440,Here we go.
00:24:44.274,00:24:45.692,-Incoming. -Yup.
00:24:47.611,00:24:49.446,"-Whoa. Oh. -Oh, no!"
00:24:53.950,00:24:55.452,"No, no, not on your forehead!"
00:24:55.535,00:24:58.872,"Yeah, well, I don't know. I-- Either that or the lap. I don't know."
00:25:06.546,00:25:08.590,"She goes, What is the panic?"
00:25:09.466,00:25:13.178,She did a better job of bracing herself for takeoff than we did.
00:25:16.806,00:25:17.974,But I love her.
00:25:27.359,00:25:29.152,when both of her kids were out of the house.
00:25:29.236,00:25:33.782,"She decided to get a third child, like, a human-sized dog."
00:25:36.201,00:25:48.088,"After I… found that out, I… I decided to, um… to do something I'd always wanted to do, which was… get a-a really big dog."
00:25:49.172,00:25:51.341,"-That's good, Mom. -Yeah. Well, that's what it is."
00:25:51.424,00:25:54.094,I'm happy that worked out for you. I'm sor--sorry you had cancer.
00:26:02.310,00:26:14.030,"That has been really hard for me On the third song, where I hadn't gotten it started yet, she goes, Come on, Mom."
00:26:14.114,00:26:15.490,"Like, into the microphone."
00:26:21.663,00:26:24.082,this life where I used to sweat all these things.
00:26:29.588,00:26:35.594,if the Internet doesn't like you today if your mom's sick from her chemo?
00:26:40.640,00:26:43.351,"-She looks like you. -Oh, she's just like you, Kitty!"
00:26:48.106,00:26:49.357,what matters to you.
00:26:50.525,00:26:53.903,"For me, it's my family and my friends."
00:26:58.658,00:27:00.035,"This is looking good, right now."
00:27:00.118,00:27:03.496,Would you like a glass of red wine or white wine?
00:27:03.580,00:27:05.915,"Can I get some white wine? Oh, you got the red wine?"
00:27:08.501,00:27:16.718,"I'm happy to switch. It's too adult for me, And… ah, yes."
00:27:16.801,00:27:17.927,"Okay, that's dinner."
00:27:24.351,00:27:26.978,"Oh, that's fine. That's honestly just what I wanted."
00:27:33.026,00:27:38.657,"And, like, I went over to see her, and… -She was just… -…with motherhood?"
00:27:53.880,00:27:56.383,"She's-- And I was like, So, it's like a Tamagotchi?"
00:29:02.073,00:29:14.043,Well… …and… I'm highly aware of the fact that that is not normal.
00:29:16.045,00:29:52.373,"I've learned over the years… to see pictures of myself every day 'cause I have a tendency, and it's only happened… a few times, and I'm not in any way proud of it, but I get… I tend to get triggered by something, whether it's a picture of me where I feel like I looked like my tummy was too big or… or, like, someone said that I looked pregnant or something, and that'll just trigger me to just… s-starve a little bit, just stop eating."
00:29:55.210,00:30:00.048,"I thought that I was just, like, supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out at the end of a show or in the middle of it."
00:30:00.131,00:30:09.265,"I thought that was how it was, and now I realize: no, if you eat food, have energy, get stronger, you can do all these shows and not feel it."
00:30:11.768,00:30:24.489,"…a really good revelation… because I'm a lot happier with who I am, and I'm happier with, like… I don't… I don't care as much if, like… somebody points out that I have gained weight."
00:30:24.572,00:30:33.832,"It's just something that makes my life better, the fact that I'm, you know… I'm a size six instead of a size double zero."
00:30:34.457,00:30:38.169,"I mean, that-- that wasn't… how my body was supposed to be."
00:30:38.253,00:30:43.758,I just didn't really… understand that a-at the time. I really don't think I knew it.
00:30:48.930,00:30:51.182,"I was like, What are you talking about? Of course I eat."
00:30:51.266,00:30:53.601,It's perfectly normal. I just exercise a lot.
00:30:54.310,00:30:57.021,"And I did exercise a lot, but I wasn't eating."
00:30:57.981,00:31:08.658,And… I just… I don't think you know you're doing that when you're doing it gradually.
00:31:12.370,00:31:13.788,that you're not meeting.
00:31:15.206,00:31:18.918,'Cause if you're thin enough then you don't have that ass that everybody wants.
00:31:19.002,00:31:23.548,"But if you have enough weight on you to have an ass, then your stomach isn't flat enough."
00:31:23.965,00:31:43.109,"It's all just… You don't ever say to yourself, Look, I've got an eating disorder, but you know you're, like, making a list of everything you put in your mouth that day, and you know that's probably not right, but then again, there's so many diet blogs that tell you that that… that that's what you should do."
00:31:45.570,00:31:49.198,"This would cause me to go into, like, a real shame… like, hate spiral."
00:31:49.741,00:31:50.575,This.
00:31:50.658,00:32:01.419,"And, like, I caught myself yesterday starting to do it, and I was like, Nope, we don't do that anymore. We do not do that anymore, because it's better to look-- to think you look fat than to look sick."
00:32:01.836,00:32:09.719,"And we don't do that anymore, and you just… We're just… We're changing the channel in our brain, and we're not… we're not doin' that anymore."
00:32:10.053,00:32:12.055,That didn't end us up in a good place.
00:32:15.767,00:32:19.354,"As your career goes like this, the magnifying glass goes like that."
00:32:22.315,00:32:24.901,Taylor Swift could not take herself more seriously.
00:32:24.984,00:32:27.779,I think that there's plenty of annoying women.
00:32:27.862,00:32:30.323,"I-I think that Taylor Swift, she is annoying."
00:32:33.785,00:32:36.663,"All of her model friends. And it's just like, come on!"
00:32:42.293,00:32:46.506,"at one point been romantic with, and there are a lot of hotties on this list."
00:32:46.589,00:32:48.091,Holy date life.
00:32:49.676,00:32:52.595,She's going through guys like a train.
00:32:57.809,00:33:00.436,you're gonna walk home with more than maybe just a trophy tonight.
00:33:00.520,00:33:01.562,I think lots of men.
00:33:01.646,00:33:03.564,I'm not gonna walk home with any men tonight.
00:33:06.651,00:33:11.489,We give you the latest can't-look-away twist in one of America's favorite celebrity feuds.
00:33:13.449,00:33:14.492,"in his new song, Famous."
00:33:14.575,00:33:18.913,The song contains a lyric calling Taylor Swift the b-word.
00:33:24.002,00:33:26.754,Kanye had said all along that he got permission. Taylor denied it.
00:33:29.882,00:33:32.093,secretly recording his conversation.
00:33:41.519,00:33:55.575,"She posted on Instagram, Where in the video is Kanye telling me he was gonna call me 'that… I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009."
00:33:55.658,00:33:59.620,I don't buy the story that she was so insulted by that one line.
00:33:59.704,00:34:05.585,"I think she saw an opportunity to be victimized here, and she thought everybody was gonna get on her side."
00:34:17.096,00:34:22.935,Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift! Fuck Taylor Swift!
00:34:35.323,00:34:46.793,"wicked and evil and conniving and not… a good person, that was the one that I couldn't really bounce back from 'cause my whole life was centered around it."
00:34:54.175,00:34:58.179,#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty was the number one trend on Twitter worldwide.
00:35:00.848,00:35:04.018,Know how many people have to be tweeting that they hate you for that to happen?
00:35:17.573,00:35:28.918,"We're people who got into this line of work because we wanted people to like us, 'cause we were intrinsically insecure, because we liked the sound of people clapping 'cause it made us forget how much we feel like we're not good enough."
00:35:29.001,00:35:32.755,"And I've been doing this for 15 years, and it's just, I'm tired of it."
00:35:44.851,00:35:47.228,"And, just, most days, I'm like, Okay."
00:35:47.311,00:35:55.903,"But then sometimes, I'm just like… ...it just gets loud sometimes."
00:36:00.324,00:36:03.077,there's nothing you can do to make them change their mind.
00:36:03.161,00:36:04.829,They just don't love you anymore.
00:36:05.955,00:36:07.373,I just wanted to disappear.
00:36:09.167,00:36:11.335,Nobody physically saw me for a year.
00:36:12.420,00:36:14.505,And that was what I thought they wanted.
00:36:46.871,00:36:48.956,was because that used to be all I had.
00:37:12.230,00:37:15.524,"I felt, you know, sort of like a wounded animal lashing out."
00:37:52.812,00:37:55.648,for my own personal sanity.
00:37:56.565,00:38:04.031,"I also was falling in love with someone who had a really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life."
00:38:05.199,00:38:09.120,And we decided together that we wanted our relationship to be private.
00:39:20.816,00:39:22.777,anyone else's input.
00:39:52.640,00:39:54.266,and I'm gonna make a record I'm proud of.
00:40:38.769,00:40:41.564,"We've never really gotten a good take without them, have we?"
00:40:42.440,00:40:43.315,No.
00:40:51.615,00:40:53.200,Like a Dylan-y kind of thing.
00:41:09.133,00:41:10.009,Something.
00:41:20.019,00:41:26.609,"Left you in the motel bar, took the money… Put the money in the bag, I stole the keys."
00:42:19.328,00:42:21.413,-That was so fun! -So much fun. So much fun.
00:42:21.497,00:42:22.665,"Oh, my God."
00:42:40.099,00:42:41.267,Hey.
00:43:06.792,00:43:08.586,-You want to-- You want a hug? -Yes.
00:43:10.629,00:43:13.882,"-Aw, so nice to meet you. -I-I can't breathe. Yeah."
00:43:24.935,00:43:26.979,-Want to make the heart. -Like this?
00:43:42.828,00:43:44.371,"-Miss Taylor Swift. -Oh, my God."
00:43:44.455,00:43:48.125,"Uh, I'm gonna ask Miss Maybelle Marciano, uh, to be my wife."
00:43:49.251,00:43:53.172,And I got this special token of my love and appreciation for you.
00:43:54.256,00:43:55.674,-Love you. -I-I love you.
00:43:57.134,00:43:59.386,"Wow! Oh, my God."
00:43:59.887,00:44:01.305,Did you know that was gonna ha--?
00:44:02.431,00:44:04.308,I didn't know that was gonna happen at all.
00:44:04.391,00:44:06.685,"I was, like-- you just, like… High-five."
00:44:08.646,00:44:10.189,"-This is--? This-- -Yes, it's official."
00:44:13.192,00:44:14.151,Whoa.
00:44:30.459,00:44:31.460,"Oh, my God."
00:44:31.543,00:44:34.088,"Like, I just want little kids to be like, There's no one like me."
00:44:39.510,00:44:41.053,"-I don't know, actually. -Yeah."
00:44:41.136,00:44:42.429,My wife is from Detroit.
00:44:42.513,00:44:45.140,"So, we talked about getting a place to test it out."
00:44:45.683,00:44:47.559,"And then fans found out, and I had to leave."
00:44:47.643,00:44:49.478,"Oh, would they-- would they just wait outside?"
00:44:49.561,00:44:51.980,"They would jump the gate and, like, try to open our front door."
00:44:55.234,00:45:05.744,There's a difference between I connect with your lyrics I had a crazy dude break into my apartment and sleep in my bed a couple months ago.
00:45:13.585,00:45:15.504,"Oh, there it is. There's that middle."
00:45:17.756,00:45:19.091,I cannot believe you're even sick.
00:45:20.551,00:45:23.011,The-There are stars next to your… your lines.
00:45:28.308,00:45:29.935,"Oh, you sound fuckin' great, man."
00:45:41.530,00:45:43.741,"Maybe your intr-- your first line should be, like..."
00:45:54.877,00:45:56.754,"Like, you're making it come alive."
00:46:14.021,00:46:19.109,"-It sounds so fun. Like, it's so fun. -And you're the pro-est pro of all time for doing this."
00:46:19.193,00:46:21.361,"No way. Thank you, guys. This is so cool."
00:46:21.445,00:46:23.322,"-This is, like… I mean, I'm… -Really good track."
00:46:23.405,00:46:27.659,"...and I'm also really so excited you're down to do, like, a massive video."
00:46:27.743,00:46:31.079,"-Oh, yeah. That's gonna be a biggie. -'Cause it's not gonna be a small one."
00:46:33.373,00:46:36.460,"My idea that I had in the beginning is, like, it starts in an apartment."
00:46:36.543,00:46:38.045,"Like, you and me get in a big fight."
00:46:42.841,00:46:47.262,"And then all of a sudden, like, I have, like, a parade happening below."
00:46:47.346,00:46:48.472,"Amazing, amazing."
00:46:48.555,00:46:51.183,"-And, like, whatever makes you you… -Yeah."
00:46:51.809,00:46:57.856,"…you know, it's just, like, emo kids, theater, dance sequences, -La La Land, everything. -Nailed it!"
00:46:57.940,00:47:05.614,"And, like, when it's like, me-ee-ee, it's like, dancers, cats, gay pride, people in country western boots."
00:47:05.697,00:47:17.000,"I start riding a unicorn, like, just… what would come out of it?"
00:48:01.378,00:48:12.347,"I really, really care about my home state, and I know that in this… at this point in time, like, my home state is a huge, hugely important part of this midterm election."
00:48:16.184,00:48:19.646,in both parties' efforts to try to control the US Senate after this year.
00:48:23.400,00:48:26.194,proclaims her support for President Trump often.
00:48:26.278,00:48:31.450,I know the left calls me a wingnut or a knuckle-dragging conservative.
00:48:31.533,00:48:34.453,"And you know what? I say, That's all right. Bring it on."
00:48:37.331,00:48:46.214,"is that she voted against the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which tries to protect women from stalking, from date rape, from domestic violence."
00:48:46.298,00:48:51.553,"And then, obviously, it's a no for gay marriage, it's a no for them to have any rights whatsoever."
00:48:53.180,00:48:54.806,I think I'll be really upset...
00:48:55.223,00:49:01.021,if people think that Tennessee… stands for those things.
00:49:11.615,00:49:19.373,"Well, I mean, I just figure, I'm a 22-year-old singer, and, you know, I don't know if people really want to hear my political views."
00:49:19.456,00:49:30.467,"I think they kind of just want to hear me sing songs is, Don't force your politics on people."
00:49:31.551,00:49:33.011,Let people live their lives.
00:49:34.888,00:49:36.723,That is grilled into us.
00:49:38.058,00:49:41.436,These three women have been the reigning queens of pop and country music.
00:49:41.520,00:49:52.656,"They're the biggest-selling female artists of all time, nearly 30 million records sold and even more fans who always used to love their high-spirited style, their music, and their moxie."
00:49:54.241,00:50:10.048,"Well, that racy magazine cover on the stands today pretty much sums up some of the names the Dixie Chicks are being called in America these days: traitors, the Dixie Sluts, anti-American, all because of one split-second comment aimed at President Bush right before the war with Iraq."
00:50:16.596,00:50:17.889,Their opinion is so ignorant.
00:50:17.973,00:50:19.641,They don't know what they're talking about.
00:50:22.269,00:50:25.731,"These are the dumbest, dumbest bimbos, with due respect, I have seen."
00:50:25.814,00:50:28.734,"These are callow, foolish women who deserve to be slapped around."
00:50:28.817,00:50:29.901,Absolutely.
00:50:35.157,00:50:40.370,"label executives and publishers would just say, Don't be like the Dixie Chicks."
00:50:51.715,00:50:55.177,A nice girl smiles and waves and says thank you.
00:50:55.343,00:50:59.431,A nice girl doesn't make people feel uncomfortable with her views.
00:51:00.098,00:51:04.394,"It's my right to vote, but it's not my right to tell other people what to do."
00:51:04.478,00:51:06.354,"-Right there, sister. -Yes, thank you."
00:51:06.438,00:51:08.356,-Come on. Come on. Come on! -All right.
00:51:10.817,00:51:18.617,"I was so obsessed with not getting in trouble, that I was like, I'm just not gonna do anything that anyone could say anything about."
00:51:28.043,00:51:35.342,"I'm just getting… I'm just… I'm getting to the point where I can't… listen to people telling me, No, stay out of it."
00:51:35.425,00:51:36.593,Stay out of it.
00:51:44.392,00:51:46.770,-Yeah. Is that right? C to the A minor? -Yeah.
00:51:46.853,00:51:48.772,Let me-- just-- Can you not play for one second?
00:51:48.855,00:51:53.235,"'Cause I'm trying to figure out this-- I like what I was doing, but I can't figure out what key it was in."
00:51:53.318,00:51:55.654,"It's like 4:00 a.m., in the middle of the night."
00:52:29.688,00:52:34.901,"Maybe it's like, I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I'd get much further if I were a man."
00:52:35.152,00:52:37.571,"Is it, If I was a man? If I was a man."
00:52:38.071,00:52:40.490,-Fine. If I was. -If I was a man. If I was a man.
00:52:40.574,00:52:41.575,If I was a man.
00:52:50.333,00:52:52.127,-I actually really love that. -Yeah.
00:52:53.712,00:52:58.258,Do you wanna start-- Maybe if you start a vibe… -Yeah. -…then this'll just write itself.
00:53:00.635,00:53:01.928,It must be so exhausting.
00:53:02.429,00:53:05.432,You must have to be thinking about this shit all the fucking time.
00:53:05.515,00:53:12.272,You are kind of doing a constant strategy in your head as to how not to be shamed for something...
00:53:14.733,00:53:34.628,"But then you get accused of being calculated Yeah, it's… I mean, I'm good, but it's been, uh… You sort of do have to twist yourself into a pretzel Do you like this for a second verse?"
00:53:35.003,00:53:41.551,"Lyric: They'd say I hustled, put in the work, instead of shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve."
00:53:41.635,00:53:44.054,"And what was I wearing, or if I was rude."
00:53:44.137,00:54:20.423,Could all be separated from… applauding business I could do… Applauding… when I'd make a move… That's really cool.
00:54:45.573,00:54:56.543,"D-Do you know how they're like… D-- We drink and we be poppin' bottles to the-- We'd be poppin' bottles to the bitches and models, Do you know? 'Cause they get to call us that."
00:55:20.650,00:55:23.778,against a former radio DJ she says once groped her.
00:55:26.781,00:55:30.535,"Mueller inappropriately grabbed her, putting his hand up her skirt."
00:55:34.539,00:55:41.421,"They did an investigation. He got fired, then he sued me for millions of dollars, so I countersued for one dollar."
00:55:46.676,00:55:56.061,"You walk into a courtroom, and then there's this person sitting in a swivel chair, staring at you like you did something to him."
00:56:00.440,00:56:05.278,"The first thing they say to you in court is, Why didn't you scream?"
00:56:06.780,00:56:08.323,Why didn't you react quicker?
00:56:09.407,00:56:11.576,Why didn't you stand further away from him?
00:56:14.329,00:56:17.582,Then he has a lawyer get up and just lie.
00:56:19.793,00:56:24.714,"There were seven people who saw him do this, and we had a photo of it happening."
00:56:26.883,00:56:28.301,And I was so angry.
00:56:29.094,00:56:31.930,I was angry that I had to be there.
00:56:32.222,00:56:34.432,I was angry that this happens to women.
00:56:34.724,00:56:39.020,I was angry that people are paid to antagonize victims.
00:56:39.562,00:56:42.315,I was angry that all the details had been twisted.
00:56:44.818,00:56:48.446,You don't feel a sense of any victory when you win...
00:56:49.155,00:56:51.741,because the process is so dehumanizing.
00:56:55.954,00:56:58.790,This is with seven witnesses and a photo.
00:56:59.207,00:57:02.419,"What happens when you get raped, and it's your word against his?"
00:57:21.020,00:58:00.560,"Just kind of looking back, um… this exact day a year ago, um… ...I was, uh… I was not playing a sold-out stadium in Tampa, I was-- I was in a courtroom in Denver, Colorado, um… Honestly, I-I was there for a sexual assault case, and… t-this day, a year ago, was the day that, um… and said that they believed me."
00:58:07.817,00:58:15.867,"I guess I just think about all the people that weren't believed, people who haven't been believed, or the people who are afraid to s-speak up because they think they won't be believed."
00:58:15.950,00:58:35.261,"And… And I just… I just wanted to say that, um… I just wanted to say I'm sorry to anyone who ever wasn't believed because I don't know h-- what turn my life would have taken if somebody'd-- if people didn't believe me when I said that something had happened to me."
00:58:37.096,01:00:14.193,So… …for taking this shitbag of shit they gave you.
01:00:14.861,01:00:16.821,"-And you made it into this. -Oh, my God."
01:00:33.796,01:00:35.923,I couldn't really stop thinking about it.
01:00:37.175,01:00:46.392,"And I just thought to myself, Next time there is any opportunity to change anything, you had better know what you stand for and what you wanna say."
01:00:51.814,01:00:57.570,"We are less than three weeks out until the midterms, and Tennessee's senate candidate Marsha Blackburn is up in the polls."
01:00:57.654,01:00:59.947,"Congratulations, I know you've got a little momentum going."
01:01:00.031,01:01:03.409,This is the third poll in a row that has shown you in the lead.
01:01:09.999,01:01:13.753,All I've talked about for the last couple of months is the election in Tennessee.
01:01:14.087,01:01:15.713,It's not that I want to step into this.
01:01:15.797,01:01:25.682,"I just-- I can't not at this point. Like… something is different in my life, completely and unchangeably different since the sexual assault trial last year."
01:01:25.765,01:01:33.356,"Like, and no… no man in my organization or in my family will ever understand what that was like."
01:01:40.405,01:01:41.656,with politics or religion.
01:01:41.739,01:01:43.616,"Yeah, but this is on the home front."
01:01:43.700,01:01:53.126,"And also, back in the presidential election, I was in such a horrendous place that I wasn't gonna pop my head out of the sand for anything."
01:01:54.293,01:01:56.796,"I mean, does Bob Hope do it? Did Bing Crosby do it?"
01:02:02.093,01:02:05.972,"First of all, these aren't your dad's celebrities, and these aren't your dad's Republicans."
01:02:09.434,01:02:12.145,that we could halve the number of people that come to your next tour.
01:02:15.231,01:02:17.442,Taylor Swift comes out against Trump.
01:02:17.525,01:02:19.152,I don't care if they write that!
01:02:20.862,01:02:24.031,"I'm sad that I didn't two years ago, but I can't change that."
01:02:25.450,01:02:32.290,"I'm saying right now that this is something that I know is right, and, you guys, I need to be on the right side of history."
01:02:32.373,01:02:45.803,"And if he doesn't win… I just want to read you what I wrote, and I'm gonna try to start… I just want you to know that this is important to me. This is-- -but let me explain to you… -Have you heard her?"
01:02:47.388,01:02:49.766,and the bottom line right now: I'm terrified.
01:02:49.849,01:02:51.809,I'm the guy that went out and bought armored cars.
01:02:52.351,01:02:55.271,I worry for her safety as much as anybody does.
01:02:55.605,01:02:56.481,Maybe more.
01:03:00.026,01:03:11.746,"She votes against… against fair pay for women, she votes against the reauthorization of the… of the Violence Against Women Act, which is just basically protecting us from domestic abuse and stalking. Stalking!"
01:03:12.497,01:03:19.837,"She votes… She thinks that-- that if you're a gay couple or even if you look like a gay couple, you should be allowed to be kicked out of a restaurant."
01:03:19.921,01:03:35.144,"It's really basic human rights, and it's right and wrong at this point, and I can't see another commercial… and see her disguising these policies behind the words Tennessee Christian values."
01:03:35.228,01:03:37.230,Those aren't Tennessee Christian values.
01:03:37.730,01:03:39.857,I live in Tennessee. I am a Christian.
01:03:39.941,01:03:41.400,That's not what we stand for.
01:03:42.944,01:03:48.658,"I need to do this. I need you to just… Dad, I just need you to forgive me for doing it, 'cause I'm doing it."
01:03:52.161,01:03:54.622,"-Okay, so... -I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous."
01:03:58.709,01:04:02.588,I always have to bring up everything that could go sideways-- -everything we need to expect. -Yeah.
01:04:02.672,01:04:05.299,"-One: the president could come after you. -Fuck that, I don't care."
01:04:05.383,01:04:12.056,"If I get bad press for saying, Don't put a homophobic racist in office, then I get bad press for that."
01:04:12.139,01:04:14.517,"-I really don't care. -I would stand behind that 1,000 times."
01:04:14.600,01:04:15.560,-Me too. -Yeah.
01:04:15.643,01:04:27.697,"I think that it is so frilly and spineless of me to stand onstage and go, Happy Pride Month, you guys, and then not say this… when someone's literally coming for their neck."
01:04:41.043,01:04:42.378,Oh...
01:04:43.462,01:04:46.007,"Oh, my God."
01:04:47.341,01:04:49.343,"Oh, it's so scary. This is the picture."
01:05:07.987,01:05:13.659,"Taylor Swift broke her silence on politics over the weekend, publicly backing two Democrats in Tennessee."
01:05:13.743,01:05:18.414,"Taylor Swift is taking her first political stand, backing Democrat Phil Bredesen."
01:05:18.497,01:05:25.546,"The superstar making it clear to her 112 million followers on Instagram, and the world, where she stands."
01:05:28.424,01:05:32.553,"Let's say that I like Taylor's music about 25% less now, okay?"
01:05:37.892,01:05:38.893,of not talking politics...
01:05:46.067,01:06:00.164,"that Taylor Swift was a crypto-conservative, and she just… to step into politics at her age, more registrations in the last day since Taylor's post than in all of August."
01:06:01.999,01:06:10.967,"According to vote.org on Monday, nationwide there have been 51,308 new registrations Yeah!"
01:06:16.681,01:06:25.856,"Do you think it'll… Do you think… I really hope it actually, actually does something."
01:06:26.565,01:06:30.194,But you know what? Donald Trump likes my music 25% less.
01:06:33.739,01:06:35.282,I feel 200 pounds lighter.
01:06:35.366,01:06:38.452,I just feel like a… I just feel… I've been feeling this way for months.
01:06:39.912,01:06:44.500,Note how Republicans are attacking Taylor Swift's intelligence instead of her ideas.
01:06:44.834,01:06:47.211,They don't respect women enough to debate them.
01:06:49.755,01:06:50.881,It's not not true.
01:07:00.433,01:07:03.978,-Stunning and sexy. -I look like a melted-down disco ball.
01:07:14.989,01:07:18.659,"You know what? This is gonna sound ridiculous, -but I can't move past here. -Ooh, you got it."
01:07:24.290,01:07:26.000,That's how this dress makes me feel.
01:08:03.120,01:08:04.830,To your right! On your right!
01:08:16.550,01:08:24.767,And I just wanted to make a mention of the fact that this award and every single award given out tonight were voted on by the people.
01:08:24.850,01:08:32.733,And you know what else is voted on by the people… …is the midterm elections on November 6th.
01:08:32.817,01:08:34.110,Get out and vote. I love you.
01:08:48.415,01:08:53.587,"One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight. Three! Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
01:08:58.509,01:09:00.177,"Yeah, I need to work on my face."
01:09:01.554,01:09:04.557,I look like I have a mean face sometimes when I'm not trying to.
01:09:04.640,01:09:05.808,Know what I mean?
01:09:07.852,01:09:12.606,Um… I think you might be more sensitive than me to that.
01:09:15.109,01:09:19.363,"-Slappable? Ouch! -Yeah, you just want to be like… What are you plotting?"
01:09:19.780,01:09:22.575,What's she planning? I'm not meaning to look like that.
01:09:22.700,01:09:25.119,You looked confident and strong. It's the chorus.
01:09:27.121,01:09:29.248,I'm gonna try to be more likable on the next one.
01:09:29.331,01:09:30.875,"All right, all right. Perfect."
01:09:41.010,01:09:42.553,I feel that way all the time.
01:09:43.637,01:09:51.604,"You know what we call this? This is last rhino of the stampede, Everybody else is runnin'. Limping."
01:09:52.688,01:09:53.689,First to get eaten.
01:09:54.732,01:09:57.067,I keep looking down because I'm afraid.
01:09:58.360,01:09:59.361,And it shows.
01:10:04.033,01:10:13.459,"where women in entertainment are discarded in an elephant graveyard Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
01:10:34.396,01:10:38.651,have reinvented themselves 20 times more than the male artists.
01:10:39.652,01:10:43.239,They have to… or else you're out of a job.
01:10:45.741,01:10:53.457,"Constantly having to reinvent, constantly finding new facets of yourself that people find to be shiny."
01:10:58.963,01:11:01.590,but only in a new way and only in the way we want.
01:11:01.674,01:11:07.137,"And reinvent yourself, but only in a way that we find to be equally comforting but also a challenge for you."
01:11:09.306,01:11:16.272,"Live out a narrative that we find to be interesting enough to entertain us, but not so crazy that it makes us uncomfortable."
01:11:22.236,01:11:29.994,This is probably one of my last opportunities as an artist to grasp onto that kind of success.
01:11:31.996,01:11:46.427,"So… I don't know, like, as I'm reaching 30, I'm like… I want to work really hard… um… while society is still tolerating me being successful."
01:11:52.474,01:11:56.145,we were just talking about that-- Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.
01:11:56.228,01:12:07.239,"The Bredesen camp was very much hoping for the Swift lift, as they called it, because young voter turnout spiked here by sevenfold from the previous midterm election, and yet that wasn't enough."
01:12:10.659,01:12:13.787,I guess Tay Tay didn't have that much sway-sway.
01:12:20.919,01:12:22.671,I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
01:12:22.755,01:12:29.094,I can't believe that she gets to be the first female senator in Tennessee and she's-- she's Trump in a wig.
01:12:30.054,01:12:32.181,She represents no female interests.
01:12:34.558,01:12:44.485,She won by being a female applying to the kind of female males want us to be in a horrendous… 1950s world.
01:12:45.986,01:12:50.449,"So, for the next two years, we have to build on what started here."
01:13:05.297,01:13:08.050,"The first verse I want to be all about, like, hearing the news."
01:13:08.884,01:13:25.567,"You know, if you were, like, a kid who, like, loved Beto and thought that was the future of Texas, or you really thought Stacey Abrams was gonna win and you went door-to-door, trying to make it happen, and then she still gets beat… But it's like, statistically, you know, we have, what?"
01:13:25.651,01:13:29.530,Three to four million people turning 18 in the next two years before the next one?
01:13:29.613,01:14:06.233,"So, it's like… it's basically saying, like, Don't lose hope. Don't get… I have this idea..."
01:14:12.114,01:14:13.323,...called Only the Young.
01:14:13.824,01:14:14.825,Play it again.
01:14:43.145,01:14:50.611,"If you can just shift the power in your direction by being bold enough, then it won't be like this forever."
01:14:51.069,01:14:52.821,"-Run. Break away from this. -Yeah, yeah."
01:14:52.905,01:14:54.615,"Like, you can run from fascism."
01:14:58.744,01:15:00.704,"Mmkay, I have a partial verse."
01:15:46.083,01:15:47.125,"Like this, you know."
01:16:53.191,01:16:59.323,I just-- I feel really good about not feeling… muzzled anymore.
01:16:59.781,01:17:01.158,And it was my own doing.
01:17:03.869,01:17:07.539,I needed to learn a lot before I spoke to 200 million people.
01:17:09.166,01:17:16.298,"But… I've educated myself now, and it's time to take the masking tape off of my mouth..."
01:17:23.972,01:17:26.224,"If you have anything I can help with, just let me know."
01:17:26.308,01:17:32.773,"I think we just need to, like, really keep talking about it because we really do need people to put the pressure on those senators to pass the Equality Act."
01:17:32.856,01:17:39.071,"If they are forced to vote on it and they do vote against it publicly, then it's really-- then we have their numbers, you know, for next year."
01:17:43.367,01:17:45.827,'cause you do so many good things for people.
01:17:56.213,01:18:01.009,and also stand up for the double standards that exist in our society.
01:18:01.635,01:18:06.181,I want to wear pink and tell you how I feel about politics.
01:18:07.849,01:18:10.811,And I don't think that those things have to cancel each other out.
01:18:20.570,01:18:21.530,About a year.
01:18:22.239,01:18:32.916,"When I realized that I really like having cute nails, I will die if I get a VMA."
01:18:32.999,01:18:35.669,"Well, if we win something, you're definitely first on the list."
01:18:35.752,01:18:38.380,I will lose my shit.
01:18:45.637,01:18:47.931,I appreciate it. Give me a good review on Yelp.
01:18:49.266,01:18:51.810,-Swift Nails is the place to go. -Yeah.
01:18:53.520,01:18:55.939,"-It looks so good. -Fuck, yeah."
01:18:59.735,01:19:06.950,"And the VMA goes to… Taylor Swift, You Need to Calm Down."
01:19:09.411,01:19:21.298,"At the end of this video, there was a petition, and there still is a petition… …for the Equality Act, which basically just says we all deserve equal rights under the law."
01:19:23.925,01:19:36.396,"I want to thank everyone who signed that petition because it now has half a million signatures, which… ...which is five times the amount that it would need to warrant a response from the White House."
01:19:53.038,01:20:02.881,"I'm trying to be as educated as possible on how to respect people, on how to… deprogram the misogyny in my own brain."
01:20:03.507,01:20:07.135,"Toss it out, reject it, and resist it."
01:20:07.552,01:20:10.013,"Like, there is no such thing as a slut."
01:20:10.096,01:20:11.848,There is no such thing as a bitch.
01:20:11.932,01:20:15.185,"There is no such thing as someone who's bossy, there's just a boss."
01:20:15.560,01:20:18.438,We don't want to be condemned for being multifaceted.
01:20:28.240,01:20:29.699,because we're trained to say sorry.
01:20:29.783,01:21:00.939,"Yeah, we legitimately are. We're, like… with the songs that I wrote… It's out. It's out on iTunes."
01:21:01.022,01:21:02.107,It's out on iTunes.
01:21:02.190,01:21:03.358,"Oh, my God."
01:21:06.820,01:21:10.115,It's out. It's out. It's out.
01:21:10.198,01:21:12.242,We're listening to it right now.
01:21:14.578,01:21:16.580,No one is this good and works harder.
01:21:16.955,01:21:18.832,"If you're that good, usually you don't work that hard."
01:21:22.669,01:21:55.785,"After 13 years of constantly feeling like I was misunderstood, knowing that everything that happened was all gonna turn into this moment is… that they're frozen at the age they got famous, and that's kind of what happened to me."
01:22:03.710,01:22:05.086,Just gonna go have fun.
01:22:05.545,01:22:08.590,No one out there that I know of in the audience actively hates me.
01:22:08.673,01:22:10.175,Not get dead-faced.
01:22:23.104,01:22:27.817,"Oh, I tried to practice my songs, but I completely psyched myself out and broke down crying."
01:22:28.360,01:22:29.903,I don't know if I can do this.
01:22:30.445,01:22:33.323,"I want it so bad, but I get so scared of what might happen."
01:22:35.700,01:22:37.452,"Relax, I can handle it."
01:22:37.994,01:22:40.914,I'm young. I'm talented. They'll see it in me.
01:22:41.206,01:22:42.374,I've got to hang on.
01:23:29.295,01:23:32.757,and a thin skin and an open heart.
