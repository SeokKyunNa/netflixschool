00:01:06.316,00:01:07.818,Master Li is here!
00:01:07.860,00:01:09.277,MAN: Master Li is here!
00:01:21.832,00:01:24.919,Shu Lien!
00:01:27.838,00:01:30.340,Shu Lien!
00:01:35.888,00:01:37.848,Master Li.
00:01:37.890,00:01:39.182,How's everything?
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.726,WOMAN: Fine. Please come in.
00:01:52.362,00:01:55.198,Li Mu Bai.
00:01:55.198,00:01:56.366,It has.
00:01:56.408,00:01:57.952,How's business?
00:01:57.993,00:01:59.745,Not bad.
00:01:59.787,00:02:00.955,Fine.
00:02:05.333,00:02:07.920,Monk Zheng came by from the Wudang Mountain.
00:02:07.962,00:02:10.505,He said you were practicing deep meditation.
00:02:12.841,00:02:14.426,The mountain must be so peaceful.
00:02:14.468,00:02:16.470,I envy you.
00:02:16.511,00:02:19.598,My work keeps me so busy I hardly get a minute's rest.
00:02:21.850,00:02:23.226,I broke it off.
00:02:23.226,00:02:26.105,I couldn't complete the training.
00:02:26.229,00:02:30.442,Why? You're a Wudang fighter.
00:02:30.484,00:02:36.281,"During my meditation training, I came to a place of deep silence."
00:02:37.449,00:02:40.119,I was surrounded by light.
00:02:40.243,00:02:43.122,Time and space disappeared.
00:02:44.623,00:02:48.627,I felt I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
00:02:51.254,00:02:52.756,You were enlightened.
00:02:52.798,00:02:54.883,Far from it.
00:02:54.925,00:02:58.345,I didn't feel the bliss one should feel when enlightened.
00:02:58.386,00:03:02.641,"Instead, I was surrounded by an endless sorrow."
00:03:04.267,00:03:07.688,It was more than I could take.
00:03:07.729,00:03:10.607,I couldn't go on.
00:03:12.275,00:03:16.030,There was something pulling me back into the world.
00:03:17.280,00:03:18.573,What was it?
00:03:21.910,00:03:24.287,Something I can't seem to let go of.
00:03:28.291,00:03:30.919,I see you're preparing to leave.
00:03:30.961,00:03:35.590,We're making a delivery to Beijing.
00:03:35.632,00:03:39.553,Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
00:03:44.975,00:03:48.145,The Green Destiny Sword?
00:03:48.187,00:03:51.773,I am. He has always been our greatest protector.
00:03:51.815,00:03:54.818,I don't understand.
00:03:54.860,00:03:57.154,It's been with you a long time.
00:03:58.530,00:04:00.908,Too many men have died at its edge.
00:04:05.412,00:04:10.125,It may look pure but only because blood washes easily from its blade.
00:04:10.167,00:04:13.962,"You use it for good cause, making you worthy of it."
00:04:16.548,00:04:19.760,It's time for me to leave it behind.
00:04:19.801,00:04:22.221,So what will you do then?
00:04:25.432,00:04:27.768,Come with me to Beijing.
00:04:27.809,00:04:30.854,You can give the sword to Sir Te in person.
00:04:30.896,00:04:33.774,It'll be just like old times.
00:04:35.234,00:04:39.362,I need to visit my master's grave.
00:04:39.404,00:04:43.117,It's been many years since he was murdered by Jade Fox.
00:04:43.158,00:04:48.496,"I have yet to avenge his death, and yet I'm thinking of quitting."
00:04:48.538,00:04:51.583,I must pray for his forgiveness.
00:04:51.625,00:04:56.213,Catch up with me when you have finished.
00:04:56.255,00:04:58.966,I will wait for you if you come.
00:04:59.007,00:05:01.718,Maybe.
00:05:08.642,00:05:09.977,"Okay, you may pass."
00:05:10.018,00:05:11.686,Thanks.
00:05:11.728,00:05:13.396,We can rest after we unload the shipment.
00:05:13.396,00:05:14.773,Let's go.
00:05:24.449,00:05:27.661,Thank God everything is safe.
00:05:27.702,00:05:30.705,Just doing my job.
00:05:30.747,00:05:35.127,Sun Security has been the best since your father started it.
00:05:35.169,00:05:39.631,You're a credit to your father's memory.
00:05:39.673,00:05:40.966,Thank you.
00:05:41.008,00:05:42.467,It's the truth.
00:06:18.461,00:06:20.881,This is Li's personal sword.
00:06:22.465,00:06:26.053,A great hero is worthy of a great weapon.
00:06:26.094,00:06:30.974,He is the only one in the world worthy of it.
00:06:31.016,00:06:34.353,It's too fine a gift.
00:06:34.477,00:06:38.106,The sword has brought Li Mu Bai as much trouble as glory.
00:06:38.148,00:06:41.068,Li wants to leave these troubles behind.
00:06:41.109,00:06:44.779,Take the sword and help him leave his old way of life.
00:06:44.821,00:06:46.281,I see. All right.
00:06:46.323,00:06:48.158,I'll act as the sword's custodian.
00:06:50.911,00:06:52.954,"Ninth Level Counsel, Chief Yu has arrived."
00:06:52.996,00:06:55.165,I must change.
00:06:55.207,00:07:00.212,Thank you. You've always been a great friend to Li and me.
00:07:00.254,00:07:03.215,No hurry to leave.
00:07:03.257,00:07:06.634,You'll stay the night as my guest.
00:07:06.676,00:07:13.808,"Now, Shu Lien, tell me something, and forgive me for prying."
00:07:13.850,00:07:20.107,But your father was like a brother to me and I think of you as my own daughter.
00:07:20.148,00:07:22.567,"Please, Sir Te, what is it?"
00:07:22.609,00:07:32.077,"Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days, maybe he's hinting something to you."
00:07:32.119,00:07:35.038,I don't know.
00:07:35.080,00:07:37.999,I've known all along about your feelings for each other.
00:07:38.041,00:07:44.131,Neither of you have been brave enough to reveal your feelings to each other.
00:07:45.840,00:07:48.302,So many years went wasted.
00:07:49.761,00:07:51.805,Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
00:07:51.846,00:07:54.349,Maybe it isn't what you've thought.
00:07:56.310,00:08:03.275,"When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots."
00:08:03.317,00:08:12.575,"If Li Mu Bai doesn't talk straight next time you see him, let me know, and I'll give him an earful!"
00:08:20.292,00:08:22.169,You will stay in this room.
00:08:28.216,00:08:29.801,You?
00:08:34.597,00:08:37.934,I am your guest here today.
00:08:39.936,00:08:42.897,This is Sir Te's study.
00:08:42.939,00:08:45.275,It's so crowded out there.
00:08:45.317,00:08:47.902,I was looking for a quiet place.
00:08:47.944,00:08:50.030,"I'm Sir Te's head servant, De Lu."
00:08:50.071,00:08:52.032,This is another of our guests.
00:09:04.794,00:09:07.964,It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal.
00:09:08.006,00:09:10.258,SHU LIEN: It's the handle that's heavy.
00:09:10.300,00:09:11.926,And that blade is no ordinary metal.
00:09:11.968,00:09:15.222,"Still, the sword is the lightest of all weapons."
00:09:15.263,00:09:18.141,You find it heavy because you're not used to handling them.
00:09:18.183,00:09:20.643,"No, I've had a lot of experience with weapons."
00:09:20.685,00:09:22.979,My father has security guards living with us.
00:09:23.021,00:09:25.190,They let me play with their weapons.
00:09:26.649,00:09:28.735,This scabbard is so beautiful.
00:09:30.237,00:09:32.239,Beautiful and yet dangerous.
00:09:32.280,00:09:36.784,"Once you've seen it tainted with blood, you'll think otherwise."
00:09:36.826,00:09:40.038,It's 400 years old.
00:09:40.080,00:09:42.707,It's exquisite.
00:09:42.749,00:09:45.460,You said this sword belongs to...
00:09:45.502,00:09:48.338,My friend Li Mu Bai.
00:09:48.380,00:09:50.131,He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
00:09:50.173,00:09:53.134,Li Mu Bai!
00:09:53.176,00:09:55.053,I've heard so much about him.
00:09:55.095,00:09:57.472,Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
00:09:57.514,00:09:59.849,It's a long story.
00:10:01.768,00:10:03.562,"You must be a sword fighter, too."
00:10:03.603,00:10:06.106,"Yes, but I prefer the machete."
00:10:06.147,00:10:10.110,This sword fits Li Mu Bai perfectly.
00:10:12.070,00:10:13.363,Really.
00:10:15.574,00:10:18.952,It must be exciting to be a fighter.
00:10:18.993,00:10:23.039,"Fighters have rules, too."
00:10:23.081,00:10:24.916,Always keep your promise.
00:10:24.958,00:10:27.419,"Without rules, we wouldn't survive long."
00:10:28.836,00:10:30.880,I've read all about people like you.
00:10:30.922,00:10:33.883,"Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!"
00:10:33.925,00:10:37.011,Writers have to write like that to sell books.
00:10:37.053,00:10:39.889,You're just like the characters in the stories.
00:10:39.931,00:10:44.394,"Sure, no place to bathe for days, sleeping on flea-infested beds."
00:10:44.436,00:10:46.813,They tell you all about that in those books?
00:10:46.854,00:10:49.023,You know what I mean.
00:10:49.065,00:10:52.944,"I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want."
00:10:54.571,00:10:57.365,I've heard of your engagement.
00:11:01.119,00:11:04.789,"It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?"
00:11:06.458,00:11:08.168,"You are not married, are you?"
00:11:08.209,00:11:10.253,What do you think?
00:11:10.295,00:11:13.089,No. You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
00:11:13.131,00:11:16.759,I admit you're probably right.
00:11:48.916,00:11:50.669,"SIR TE: Chief Yu, take a look."
00:12:02.222,00:12:07.018,"2 feet 9 inches long, 1.1 inch wide."
00:12:07.060,00:12:14.484,"The handle is 1 inch long, 2.6 inches wide, 0.7 inch thick, each side is 1.5 inches."
00:12:14.526,00:12:17.278,With seven rubies missing from the hilt.
00:12:17.320,00:12:20.490,You can tell from the design that it was made during the Qin Wu era.
00:12:22.242,00:12:25.036,Engraved with a technique lost during the Han Dynasty.
00:12:25.078,00:12:28.081,Your knowledge is remarkable.
00:12:29.916,00:12:32.293,A sword by itself rules nothing.
00:12:32.335,00:12:34.921,It comes alive only through skillful manipulation.
00:12:34.962,00:12:39.050,I see your point.
00:12:39.092,00:12:42.429,The inner city in Beijing is not a problem.
00:12:42.470,00:12:51.271,With royalty and officials everywhere the Royal Guard keep security tight.
00:12:51.312,00:12:53.607,But the outer city is hard to govern.
00:12:53.648,00:12:57.985,It's full of complex characters.
00:12:58.027,00:13:01.114,Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order.
00:13:01.155,00:13:03.575,Don't depend only on the court.
00:13:03.617,00:13:07.328,Keep some contacts in the Jiang Hu underworld.
00:13:07.370,00:13:09.372,It can ensure your position.
00:13:14.043,00:13:18.881,Be strong yet supple.
00:13:46.909,00:13:48.161,Governess.
00:13:49.746,00:13:50.955,Let me do it.
00:13:54.751,00:13:56.503,Please sit.
00:13:56.544,00:13:58.254,I've made a pair of silk pajamas.
00:13:58.296,00:13:59.714,Want to change into them?
00:13:59.756,00:14:01.090,Leave them there.
00:14:06.929,00:14:10.391,I heard you met Yu Shu Lien today.
00:14:10.433,00:14:13.186,You know her?
00:14:13.227,00:14:16.981,Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
00:14:19.942,00:14:22.570,I'll socialize with whomever I please.
00:14:22.612,00:14:25.365,Don't invite danger into your father's house.
00:14:28.618,00:14:30.077,I'm tired now!
00:14:30.119,00:14:31.621,Go to bed then.
00:14:36.083,00:14:38.712,You've grown up and will get married soon.
00:14:40.463,00:14:43.174,God knows what the future will bring.
00:14:43.216,00:14:46.594,It'll be just the same.
00:14:46.636,00:14:48.388,"Enough, I'm tired."
00:14:53.226,00:14:56.396,It's autumn now. I'll shut the windows for you.
00:15:23.590,00:15:25.174,"MAN: Chilly, eh?"
00:16:01.544,00:16:02.754,Thief!
00:16:26.068,00:16:31.365,Someone help! Catch the thief!
00:16:33.493,00:16:36.287,The sword's been stolen!
00:16:37.705,00:16:39.749,He's on the roof!
00:17:04.440,00:17:07.318,Catch him!
00:17:08.778,00:17:11.364,MAY: Avenge my mother!
00:17:12.949,00:17:15.869,What are you standing here for? Go get him!
00:17:18.371,00:17:21.123,"Return the sword, and I'll let you go."
00:17:26.587,00:17:28.840,You've been trained at Wudang?
00:17:32.593,00:17:35.680,We are street performers.
00:17:35.722,00:17:37.139,We're just practicing the stunts.
00:17:37.139,00:17:38.933,Let's go.
00:17:38.975,00:17:42.603,Practicing? Who are you trying to fool?
00:17:42.645,00:17:44.313,Where did they go?
00:17:55.825,00:17:58.160,Chief Yu's house.
00:19:39.595,00:19:41.139,Get down here!
00:19:56.112,00:19:57.530,Get down.
00:19:57.571,00:19:58.948,Give me the sword.
00:21:12.897,00:21:15.108,Sir Te awaits you in the great hall.
00:21:16.650,00:21:18.360,BO: I didn't get the sword back.
00:21:18.360,00:21:22.240,But I'm sure the thief's connected to the Yus.
00:21:22.364,00:21:24.117,How dare you!
00:21:22.364,00:21:25.993,But I saw-- Enough! Get out!
00:21:37.504,00:21:40.133,Has Chief Yu ever seen the sword?
00:21:40.174,00:21:44.386,"Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this."
00:21:44.386,00:21:47.431,But the sword is somewhere in his compound.
00:21:51.102,00:21:55.731,Then someone's out to frame him.
00:21:55.773,00:21:58.651,We should get word to Li Mu Bai about this.
00:22:03.697,00:22:05.407,GOVERNESS: Watch your step.
00:22:06.575,00:22:08.161,MAN: What happened?
00:22:08.202,00:22:11.831,What is it?
00:22:11.872,00:22:15.042,Go away.
00:22:16.919,00:22:18.420,Let me see.
00:22:25.052,00:22:27.096,Someone's after Jade Fox.
00:22:27.138,00:22:29.056,"Preposterous, looking for her here!"
00:22:31.475,00:22:33.019,Hmm.
00:22:45.572,00:22:47.616,Best spear fighting in the world!
00:22:47.658,00:22:49.576,The Yang School of Spear Fighting!
00:23:06.093,00:23:09.805,Where did they go?
00:23:09.847,00:23:12.766,I saw them couple of days ago.
00:24:04.526,00:24:07.529,"Miss, there's a Miss Yu here asking to see you."
00:24:07.529,00:24:08.948,Our Lady is busy right now.
00:24:08.989,00:24:10.366,I will tell her then.
00:24:10.408,00:24:11.825,Show her in.
00:24:13.535,00:24:14.703,Yes.
00:24:19.375,00:24:22.002,This spells trouble.
00:24:24.088,00:24:26.090,I have a guest now.
00:24:32.888,00:24:34.974,"This way please, Miss Yu."
00:24:40.896,00:24:43.357,I've missed you!
00:24:43.399,00:24:44.942,I have nothing to do.
00:24:51.907,00:24:53.951,You're practicing calligraphy.
00:24:55.286,00:24:58.164,I'll write your name.
00:25:24.773,00:25:27.818,I never noticed that my name looks like the word for sword.
00:25:27.860,00:25:29.862,You write gracefully.
00:25:29.903,00:25:32.614,Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
00:25:32.614,00:25:34.741,Maybe it is.
00:25:36.702,00:25:37.870,Please.
00:25:42.291,00:25:43.750,Thank you for seeing me.
00:25:43.792,00:25:45.752,I hear your wedding day is near.
00:25:45.794,00:25:48.047,You must be overwhelmed with the preparations.
00:25:48.088,00:25:49.840,I'm hardly doing a thing.
00:25:49.882,00:25:51.925,"The less I think of it, the better."
00:25:51.967,00:25:57.139,"My parents are arranging everything, including the groom."
00:25:57.181,00:26:01.643,Mother says the Gous are a very powerful family.
00:26:01.685,00:26:05.731,My marrying into this family will give my dad's career a big boost.
00:26:05.772,00:26:09.693,It's a great fortune to marry into such a noble family.
00:26:09.735,00:26:17.659,"Is it? Actually, I like the great heroes in the books just like you and Li Mu Bai."
00:26:17.659,00:26:19.495,Marriage is a good thing.
00:26:19.537,00:26:26.668,"If only I could be free to live my own life, to choose who I love and love him in my own way."
00:26:26.710,00:26:28.879,That's real happiness.
00:26:30.506,00:26:33.008,Think so?
00:26:33.050,00:26:34.676,About you and Li Mu Bai?
00:26:34.718,00:26:39.432,Yes. I was once engaged to be married when I was young.
00:26:39.473,00:26:41.100,Really?
00:26:41.141,00:26:43.018,His name was Meng Si Zhao.
00:26:43.060,00:26:46.313,He was a brother-by-oath to Li Mu Bai.
00:26:46.355,00:26:52.778,"One day, while defending Li Mu Bai in battle, he was killed by another man's sword."
00:26:52.819,00:26:56.698,"After Meng's sacrifice, Li and I went through a lot together."
00:26:56.698,00:26:58.576,Our feelings for each other grew stronger.
00:26:58.700,00:27:02.955,But we decided to honor my engagement to Meng.
00:27:02.996,00:27:08.335,"The freedom you talk about, I too desire it, but I've never tasted it."
00:27:08.377,00:27:11.046,"It's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's."
00:27:11.088,00:27:14.383,"Too bad for Meng, but that's just the way things turn out."
00:27:16.427,00:27:24.810,"As a woman, I still must abide by tradition even if I'm not an aristocrat like you."
00:27:24.851,00:27:31.358,Don't distance us.
00:27:32.568,00:27:37.323,"All right. As a sister, I hope you find real happiness."
00:28:13.567,00:28:17.070,MADAME YU: Miles and miles of nothing.
00:28:17.112,00:28:21.367,Can't your father get an appointment closer to civilization?
00:28:21.408,00:28:22.784,This place!
00:28:24.036,00:28:27.331,"Jen, are you listening to me?"
00:28:56.318,00:28:57.611,Let's go.
00:29:21.927,00:29:23.887,Who are you?
00:29:23.929,00:29:26.348,Hold it! I'm a friend!
00:29:30.227,00:29:33.146,I don't care about your sword.
00:29:33.188,00:29:35.566,Why are you spying on the Yus?
00:29:35.608,00:29:38.318,I'm looking for someone.
00:29:38.360,00:29:42.155,"I'm a police inspector from the Shaan Xi, Gen Su district."
00:29:42.197,00:29:44.700,This Jade Fox is a master criminal.
00:29:44.742,00:29:46.619,I hear she infiltrated the Yus.
00:29:46.660,00:29:50.872,She must have come with them when he transferred here.
00:29:50.872,00:29:53.584,But I cannot just go in and catch her there.
00:29:53.626,00:29:55.502,I have to lure her out.
00:29:55.544,00:29:57.671,This Jade Fox is a woman?
00:29:57.713,00:30:00.257,Then leave her to me.
00:30:00.299,00:30:03.427,"Thank you, but I doubt you can handle her."
00:30:03.469,00:30:05.178,My wife used to be quite a martial artist.
00:30:05.220,00:30:07.806,Jade Fox killed her.
00:30:07.847,00:30:12.185,It's both an official and a personal matter to me.
00:30:13.729,00:30:15.397,Meatballs are ready!
00:30:15.439,00:30:17.650,I'm more than ready for them.
00:30:17.691,00:30:20.611,"Wait, Dad gets first dip!"
00:30:22.738,00:30:24.864,Hey!
00:30:24.906,00:30:26.408,They are gone.
00:30:28.076,00:30:29.869,What does it say?
00:30:29.911,00:30:32.956,We'll settle this at midnight tonight on Cemetery Hill.
00:30:32.998,00:30:35.709,Good! The Fox is out of her hole.
00:30:37.252,00:30:38.420,Please.
00:30:40.422,00:30:42.591,"Shu Lien, look who's here."
00:30:48.555,00:30:52.184,Sir Te thinks it's not appropriate to cast doubt on Chief Yu.
00:30:52.225,00:30:54.478,But there is something up in the Yu household.
00:30:54.520,00:30:55.895,I'm investigating.
00:30:55.937,00:30:57.356,What have you found?
00:31:10.076,00:31:12.746,Jade Fox?
00:31:12.788,00:31:15.833,You'd always suspected she'd fled out west.
00:31:15.957,00:31:18.210,She has the nerve to come to Beijing.
00:31:18.251,00:31:21.463,Is there any place safer than under the nose of Chief Yu?
00:31:23.965,00:31:27.177,I shall avenge my master's death after all.
00:31:28.637,00:31:31.598,"But be careful, Li Mu Bai."
00:31:31.640,00:31:33.975,Sir Te requires discretion.
00:31:33.975,00:31:40.774,"Official business is already difficult to resolve, it'd be a bigger mess with your personal matters involved."
00:31:40.816,00:31:43.777,"And I don't know, this flyer may not be reliable."
00:31:43.819,00:31:45.821,It could be some sort of trap.
00:31:48.490,00:31:50.033,Did you see who posted it?
00:31:50.075,00:31:51.284,No.
00:31:51.326,00:31:53.787,It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.
00:31:53.829,00:31:57.750,Sir Te says the night of the theft there was a brawl in front of Yu's.
00:31:57.791,00:31:59.793,Were you involved?
00:31:59.835,00:32:03.088,"No, that was Bo, Sir Te's man."
00:32:03.129,00:32:05.006,Bo followed the thief to the Yus.
00:32:05.006,00:32:06.633,Have you cross-examined him yet?
00:32:06.675,00:32:09.010,"Bo? No, not yet..."
00:32:09.010,00:32:12.639,But you've had your men stake out Yu's compound?
00:32:12.681,00:32:15.058,"No, I'd already sent them back."
00:32:17.018,00:32:22.816,"You can blame me for losing the sword but trust me, I'll get it back soon using my own methods."
00:32:24.693,00:32:26.820,That's not what I meant.
00:32:26.862,00:32:29.030,I don't care about the sword.
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.116,How can you say that?
00:32:31.157,00:32:32.659,Didn't you come back here for it?
00:32:32.701,00:32:36.538,I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.
00:32:37.873,00:32:39.458,"Then, why did you come?"
00:32:41.710,00:32:45.046,"Well, we had talked..."
00:32:47.800,00:32:51.136,"Pardon my intrusion. Master Li, your room is ready."
00:32:53.680,00:32:55.849,Thank you.
00:32:55.891,00:32:57.643,"Please, lead the way."
00:33:08.654,00:33:11.197,BO: This Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.
00:33:11.239,00:33:13.158,There's no sign of her.
00:33:21.082,00:33:23.084,BO: Enough! Don't pretend anymore.
00:33:27.464,00:33:30.300,Tsai! You old scoundrel!
00:33:30.342,00:33:32.594,You won't leave me alone.
00:33:32.636,00:33:35.555,"Yeah, old lady?"
00:33:35.597,00:33:38.934,"If you surrender now, you'll suffer less."
00:33:38.976,00:33:42.103,"If you resist, you're dead today."
00:33:42.103,00:33:45.106,Dad! Let me avenge my mother's death.
00:33:45.148,00:33:47.985,"You'll end up like her, you little whore!"
00:33:48.109,00:33:50.403,You old fox!
00:34:25.146,00:34:26.272,MAY: Dad!
00:34:56.053,00:34:59.264,"TSAI: You old fox, you ruined my life."
00:35:13.946,00:35:16.197,Watch out for her acupressure!
00:35:22.079,00:35:23.747,TSAI: Sue!
00:35:32.213,00:35:34.091,"Tsai, you dog!"
00:35:36.551,00:35:38.511,You even have hidden hands!
00:35:42.808,00:35:45.560,"MAY: Dad, are you okay?"
00:35:45.602,00:35:48.521,Wudang should have gotten rid of you long ago.
00:35:48.563,00:35:50.983,"It's been a long time, Jade Fox!"
00:35:52.233,00:35:54.235,You probably don't remember me.
00:35:54.235,00:35:58.281,But you remember my master.
00:35:58.323,00:36:03.244,You infiltrated my clan while I was away.
00:36:03.244,00:36:05.330,You poisoned my master and stole the secret manual.
00:36:05.371,00:36:08.458,Now it's time for you to pay!
00:36:08.500,00:36:11.461,Your master underestimated us women.
00:36:11.503,00:36:14.589,He wouldn't teach me even after he'd slept with me.
00:36:14.631,00:36:17.759,He deserved to die by a woman's hands!
00:36:58.466,00:37:01.678,You stole the top secrets of Wudang's martial arts.
00:37:01.720,00:37:05.182,But you've mastered only the basic moves in the past ten years.
00:37:05.306,00:37:10.395,For you to die under Wudang's sword today is no disgrace!
00:37:16.526,00:37:20.030,My disciple! Fight with me!
00:37:20.072,00:37:21.781,Fox has a disciple!
00:37:21.823,00:37:23.992,I've got to get rid of Tsai!
00:37:30.373,00:37:31.958,Who are you?
00:37:33.835,00:37:36.046,Why is the Green Destiny Sword in your possession?
00:37:36.088,00:37:39.174,It's none of your business.
00:37:39.216,00:37:40.967,My name is Li Mu Bai.
00:37:41.009,00:37:43.428,The Green Destiny Sword is mine.
00:37:53.772,00:37:56.149,Jade Fox can't be your master.
00:37:56.191,00:37:57.734,Where did you learn this Xuan Piu move?
00:37:57.776,00:37:59.402,Piece of cake.
00:38:05.784,00:38:07.410,LI MU BAI: Who is your master?
00:38:23.051,00:38:24.552,MAY: Dad!
00:38:28.640,00:38:30.225,Let's go.
00:38:30.267,00:38:31.559,I'll kill them once and for all.
00:38:32.978,00:38:34.854,Hurry up.
00:38:36.564,00:38:37.941,Let's go!
00:38:40.526,00:38:42.862,MAY: Dad!
00:38:42.904,00:38:44.072,Dad!
00:38:50.620,00:38:51.997,MAY: Dad!
00:38:54.582,00:38:55.750,Dad.
00:39:03.842,00:39:05.302,This is Tsai?
00:39:07.428,00:39:10.849,My father.
00:39:12.600,00:39:17.438,Homicide must be reported to Chief Yu.
00:39:17.438,00:39:19.524,"In addition, the victim is an officer."
00:39:19.565,00:39:23.028,You believe the killer is hiding out in this compound?
00:39:24.529,00:39:26.698,"I'd put my life on it, sir."
00:39:31.036,00:39:32.495,Come with me.
00:39:34.122,00:39:38.001,"This needs to be resolved, and quickly."
00:39:38.043,00:39:40.920,I'll get into the Yu household and get her.
00:39:40.962,00:39:44.341,I'll ferret out this Fox and her gang in no time.
00:39:44.465,00:39:45.925,SHU LIEN: Too dangerous.
00:39:45.967,00:39:49.470,Yu is a court official and in charge of security.
00:39:49.470,00:39:51.973,This could ruin his reputation and career.
00:39:52.015,00:39:54.600,It might also get Sir Te in trouble.
00:39:56.311,00:39:58.021,This calls for the utmost delicacy.
00:39:58.063,00:40:04.443,"Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Mrs. and Miss Yu over?"
00:40:04.485,00:40:07.155,What do you have in mind?
00:40:08.698,00:40:12.369,The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
00:40:14.871,00:40:20.459,"Oh, my! Mrs. Te is spoiling us with all these gifts."
00:40:20.501,00:40:23.880,She is being so considerate to our daughter.
00:40:23.922,00:40:27.259,I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to entertain you today.
00:40:27.300,00:40:30.178,I heard Sir Te has lost something.
00:40:30.220,00:40:33.556,And now Mrs. Te is not feeling well.
00:40:33.598,00:40:36.142,We know who stole the missing item.
00:40:39.187,00:40:46.236,If the thief returns it I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
00:40:46.278,00:40:48.029,That's good.
00:40:48.071,00:40:52.825,It's a real annoyance to have servants who steal.
00:40:52.867,00:40:56.704,Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people sometimes make mistakes.
00:40:56.746,00:41:01.376,Some mistakes can ruin not only themselves but their entire family as well.
00:41:02.919,00:41:04.754,But don't be too lenient.
00:41:04.796,00:41:06.798,Sure.
00:41:04.796,00:41:10.343,"For example, no mercy will be shown to the murderer who just turned up in Beijing."
00:41:10.385,00:41:12.011,MADAME YU: A murderer?
00:41:12.053,00:41:17.767,"Yes, the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master."
00:41:17.809,00:41:22.105,Last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her for many years.
00:41:22.147,00:41:24.690,MADAME YU: A female criminal!
00:41:24.732,00:41:28.069,You say she killed a policeman?
00:41:28.111,00:41:29.946,"Yes, from the west."
00:41:29.988,00:41:33.616,"He went undercover as a street performer, and followed her here."
00:41:33.658,00:41:38.121,"I'm no detective, but maybe the murderer and thief are the same."
00:41:38.163,00:41:40.415,I doubt that.
00:41:40.457,00:41:44.461,This particular thief is very unusual.
00:41:44.585,00:41:47.046,And most likely smarter than a mere killer.
00:41:59.434,00:42:01.227,"Greetings, Sir Te."
00:42:01.269,00:42:04.063,"Hello, Mrs. Yu."
00:42:04.105,00:42:08.151,"Let me introduce Li Mu Bai, the renowned swordsman."
00:42:08.193,00:42:10.903,"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Yu, Ms. Yu."
00:42:10.945,00:42:13.406,Ms. Yu is getting married soon.
00:42:16.117,00:42:18.411,Congratulations.
00:42:31.757,00:42:33.926,Why don't you come in?
00:42:33.968,00:42:36.179,I'm standing guard.
00:42:36.221,00:42:38.264,Come in. It's cold.
00:42:44.521,00:42:47.899,Come in. We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together.
00:43:12.673,00:43:15.134,LI MU BAI: Isn't it a little late to be out?
00:43:18.012,00:43:19.931,You can give the sword to me.
00:43:19.972,00:43:22.434,I'll do as I please.
00:43:25.853,00:43:27.564,Where's your master?
00:43:27.688,00:43:28.814,None of your business!
00:43:55.341,00:43:56.842,LI MU BAI: Had enough flying?
00:44:00.763,00:44:02.140,LI MU BAI: You've got potential.
00:44:02.181,00:44:06.727,But you've misunderstood Wudang's secret manual quite a bit.
00:44:08.896,00:44:12.108,You need a real master.
00:44:12.150,00:44:14.611,A master like you?
00:44:14.735,00:44:16.488,"LI MU BAI: You're right, it's all meaningless."
00:44:16.529,00:44:23.453,"School is meaningless, the secret manual is meaningless, even this sword."
00:44:23.495,00:44:26.080,Don't talk like a monk just because you're in a temple.
00:44:26.122,00:44:27.332,Just fight!
00:44:27.373,00:44:28.874,Then tell me where Jade Fox is!
00:44:28.916,00:44:30.168,Move!
00:44:44.098,00:44:47.435,True strength is light as a feather.
00:45:04.285,00:45:06.538,"No assistance, no growth."
00:45:07.830,00:45:10.833,"No reaction, no explanation."
00:45:10.875,00:45:12.918,"No control, no desire."
00:45:12.960,00:45:15.630,Give yourself up and find yourself again.
00:45:17.089,00:45:19.133,Here's a lesson for you on life.
00:45:24.305,00:45:25.640,Go ahead.
00:45:27.559,00:45:29.810,Why should I?
00:45:29.852,00:45:32.813,Learn to defeat movement with stillness.
00:45:32.855,00:45:35.567,That way you'll be worthy of the Green Destiny.
00:45:38.194,00:45:40.071,Why do you want to teach me?
00:45:41.822,00:45:46.536,I've always wanted a disciple worthy of the Wudang secrets.
00:45:48.829,00:45:51.457,Aren't you afraid that I'd kill you once I mastered it?
00:45:51.499,00:45:55.002,That's a risk I'm willing to take as your teacher.
00:45:55.044,00:45:57.338,Deep down you're good.
00:45:57.380,00:45:58.881,Even Jade Fox hasn't been able to corrupt you.
00:46:00.841,00:46:03.052,Wudang is a whorehouse!
00:46:03.094,00:46:04.679,Keep your lessons to yourself!
00:46:23.448,00:46:26.284,"You're home late, or should I say early?"
00:46:29.245,00:46:32.873,Why are you still here?
00:46:34.584,00:46:37.420,You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
00:46:37.462,00:46:41.340,They wouldn't have tracked me here if you hadn't stolen the sword.
00:46:41.382,00:46:43.175,You're not a little girl anymore.
00:46:43.217,00:46:45.219,You thought this would be fun?
00:46:45.261,00:46:49.515,"I'm in this, and you're in too."
00:46:49.557,00:46:56.689,You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some pompous bureaucrat.
00:46:56.731,00:46:58.775,"As master and disciple, we will rule."
00:46:58.899,00:47:00.735,I'll never live as a thief.
00:47:00.777,00:47:02.654,You're already the most wanted thief!
00:47:02.695,00:47:04.071,That was just for fun.
00:47:04.113,00:47:06.907,"Why would I leave, and where?"
00:47:06.907,00:47:08.909,Wherever we want.
00:47:08.951,00:47:10.703,We'd get rid of anyone in our way.
00:47:10.745,00:47:13.289,Even your father.
00:47:13.331,00:47:14.915,That's the underworld fighter lifestyle.
00:47:14.915,00:47:17.042,Kill or be killed.
00:47:17.084,00:47:19.712,"Exciting, isn't it?"
00:47:23.924,00:47:26.218,I've fulfilled my obligations to you.
00:47:26.260,00:47:28.346,"No, I have."
00:47:30.222,00:47:33.934,To have you as my disciple is the thing in my life I'm most proud of.
00:47:40.566,00:47:45.780,You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual?
00:47:45.822,00:47:48.032,Thank goodness you're illiterate.
00:47:50.117,00:47:52.787,"I studied the illustrations, and you studied the words."
00:47:52.829,00:47:54.955,You hid the details from me?
00:47:54.997,00:47:59.168,You wouldn't have understood it even if you knew how to read.
00:47:59.210,00:48:02.714,You know you've gone as far as you will go.
00:48:04.590,00:48:06.634,I hid my skills from you because I was afraid you might get hurt.
00:48:09.220,00:48:16.602,"If it weren't for seeing you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me."
00:48:19.522,00:48:20.690,Governess.
00:48:22.608,00:48:26.195,I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.
00:48:26.237,00:48:29.490,You enchanted me with the dream of the Jiang Hu underworld.
00:48:29.532,00:48:36.706,"But once I realized I could exceed you, you can't imagine how frightened I was!"
00:48:36.748,00:48:44.088,"I had no one to guide me, no one to follow, no one to learn from."
00:48:46.298,00:48:50.052,There will be more frightening things ahead.
00:50:02.834,00:50:05.503,Are you happy now that the sword is back?
00:50:07.421,00:50:10.800,"I admit, getting it back made me realize how much I missed it."
00:50:12.844,00:50:17.055,"But it's not your sword anymore, is it? You gave it to Sir Te."
00:50:19.057,00:50:24.856,True. But I must borrow it for one last job.
00:50:24.897,00:50:27.566,Jade Fox will die on its edge.
00:50:30.402,00:50:35.658,Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
00:50:35.700,00:50:39.620,My job was to recover the sword without embarrassing anyone.
00:50:39.662,00:50:45.083,"I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father."
00:50:45.125,00:50:46.544,You did your job well.
00:50:46.585,00:50:50.006,The sword is back.
00:50:51.674,00:50:53.091,I saw her last night.
00:50:55.511,00:50:57.680,I knew you'd be suspicious.
00:50:57.722,00:51:00.016,She needs controlling.
00:51:00.056,00:51:03.352,She needs real direction and training.
00:51:03.394,00:51:06.647,"She's an aristocrat's daughter, she's not one of us."
00:51:06.689,00:51:09.149,It will all be over soon.
00:51:09.149,00:51:12.152,You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.
00:51:14.446,00:51:18.951,That's not her. She should become a Wudang disciple.
00:51:18.993,00:51:21.746,But Wudang doesn't accept women.
00:51:21.787,00:51:24.916,"For her, perhaps they could make an exception."
00:51:24.957,00:51:29.169,"If not, left to her own, I'm afraid she'll become a poisonous dragon."
00:51:29.169,00:51:32.297,It's not our affair.
00:51:32.339,00:51:36.427,"Even if Wudang accepts her, her husband might object."
00:51:40.556,00:51:44.810,"I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Jiang Hu world."
00:51:44.852,00:51:48.606,But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
00:51:50.524,00:51:52.902,"I had hoped so, too."
00:51:52.944,00:51:55.947,I wish there were something I could do to help you.
00:52:01.243,00:52:04.496,"Just be patient with me, Shu Lien."
00:52:20.721,00:52:21.889,Freeze!
00:52:25.559,00:52:27.812,Lo!
00:52:41.241,00:52:43.243,You shouldn't have come.
00:52:45.245,00:52:51.002,With all the traffic on your rooftop these days it took me a while to get in here.
00:52:51.043,00:52:54.546,"I can't wait any longer, Jen."
00:52:56.465,00:52:59.885,"Come with me, back to the desert. You'll be happy there."
00:52:59.927,00:53:01.846,You can do whatever you want.
00:53:04.431,00:53:07.643,JEN YU: You have been looking for me all this time?
00:53:30.290,00:53:32.292,"Jen, stop playing with it."
00:53:33.627,00:53:35.337,I won't break it.
00:53:57.651,00:53:58.903,Charge!
00:54:01.655,00:54:03.949,Stop!
00:54:03.991,00:54:07.828,It's Dark Cloud!
00:54:14.168,00:54:15.627,Dark Cloud is coming!
00:54:16.837,00:54:18.672,Dark Cloud is coming!
00:54:21.050,00:54:23.135,Protect the ladies.
00:54:23.177,00:54:25.846,"Lower the shade, don't be seen!"
00:54:25.888,00:54:27.890,"Don't be afraid, Miss."
00:54:43.989,00:54:45.950,Don't touch the women!
00:55:32.412,00:55:35.207,Come!
00:55:35.249,00:55:37.209,Come get your comb.
00:56:23.630,00:56:26.008,LO: Hey!
00:56:26.050,00:56:28.760,Your mother is fine.
00:57:28.237,00:57:30.281,LO: Hey!
00:57:30.322,00:57:33.658,She's mine!
00:57:43.585,00:57:45.003,LO: Come get your comb.
00:57:45.045,00:57:46.797,JEN YU: Give me back my comb!
00:57:48.882,00:57:50.134,LO: Take a break.
00:57:50.175,00:57:51.593,JEN YU: Give me back my comb!
00:57:52.761,00:57:54.972,You're tired.
00:58:01.061,00:58:04.315,Your horse needs water.
00:58:11.863,00:58:14.574,"Well, there was when I last visited."
00:58:21.457,00:58:22.666,Your name?
00:58:24.126,00:58:28.046,My name is Lo.
00:58:28.088,00:58:31.800,"I'm not that tall or that big, but I'm quick as lightning."
00:58:31.842,00:58:33.177,Here.
00:58:44.771,00:58:46.315,Give me my comb.
00:59:16.636,00:59:18.638,Go to hell.
01:00:22.035,01:00:25.289,"If you like that, I can make you a bow."
01:00:25.330,01:00:27.541,Great for hunting pheasants.
01:00:27.583,01:00:29.167,They're delicious.
01:00:34.714,01:00:37.384,You need to eat something.
01:00:38.885,01:00:41.638,"That way, you'll have the strength to fight."
01:00:43.474,01:00:44.891,Understand?
01:00:54.151,01:00:57.237,You'll slowly regain your strength. Don't rush.
01:03:03.447,01:03:06.617,You have a bad temper.
01:03:13.290,01:03:14.625,You coward!
01:03:18.086,01:03:22.340,Still in a bad mood?
01:03:22.382,01:03:24.008,What's your name?
01:03:25.677,01:03:28.555,I didn't think the Hans had names like that.
01:04:08.261,01:04:12.641,"Relax. If I wanted to do what you think I want to do, I'd have done it already."
01:04:13.933,01:04:16.019,You must be dying for a bath.
01:04:16.060,01:04:20.148,"The water source is far, and difficult to get to."
01:04:20.190,01:04:22.651,I managed to bring back some fresh water.
01:04:22.693,01:04:25.570,You can wear my clothes when you are done.
01:04:25.612,01:04:27.113,They're clean.
01:04:43.296,01:04:44.715,LO: Don't worry.
01:04:47.133,01:04:50.053,"I'll sing a song, so you'll know where I am."
01:04:51.763,01:04:54.265,"After the bath, you will calm down a little."
01:04:56.059,01:04:58.854,"But promise me, no more rocks on the head."
01:06:10.884,01:06:13.386,"All this trouble, just for a comb?"
01:06:13.428,01:06:16.598,It's mine.
01:06:16.640,01:06:18.558,And it's worth a lot to me.
01:06:18.600,01:06:21.352,"But to a barbarian like you, it's nothing."
01:06:21.394,01:06:24.481,Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
01:06:24.522,01:06:28.067,"By the way, I'm a real Manchurian."
01:06:31.070,01:06:33.907,"I'm sorry, I guessed wrong."
01:06:33.949,01:06:36.242,I thought you were a Han.
01:06:38.161,01:06:39.663,Give me back my comb.
01:06:44.083,01:06:46.461,I don't take orders from anyone.
01:06:53.092,01:06:54.594,Give it to me.
01:08:12.797,01:08:18.428,"LO: One night, when I was a boy, I saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky."
01:08:20.179,01:08:23.474,"I remember thinking, where did they all go?"
01:08:23.516,01:08:25.184,I'm an orphan.
01:08:25.184,01:08:26.644,I used to look for stars alone.
01:08:28.646,01:08:32.275,"Maybe if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them."
01:08:34.527,01:08:37.363,I've been riding in the desert ever since.
01:08:38.990,01:08:41.618,And that little boy became a fearsome bandit.
01:08:41.659,01:08:46.081,"Couldn't find the stars, so now he steals my comb."
01:08:46.205,01:08:50.085,"Out there, you're always fighting for survival."
01:08:50.209,01:08:53.797,You have to gang up just to stand a chance.
01:08:53.838,01:08:57.842,"Slowly, your gang becomes your family."
01:08:57.884,01:09:02.973,All that Dark Cloud stuff is just propaganda but it does make my life easier.
01:09:04.307,01:09:08.895,So you are still the little boy at heart looking for fallen stars.
01:09:10.772,01:09:13.066,I am a man.
01:09:13.108,01:09:16.402,And I've found the brightest star of them all.
01:09:39.509,01:09:42.137,Your father's men are looking for you.
01:10:12.416,01:10:14.836,"LO: They're still out there, circling closer."
01:10:16.963,01:10:19.924,Let them look.
01:10:19.966,01:10:22.760,They'll keep looking.
01:10:24.971,01:10:27.515,Don't even think of sending me back.
01:10:29.642,01:10:31.435,It's up to you.
01:10:31.477,01:10:34.564,You might get tired of this...
01:10:36.357,01:10:39.777,...and start missing your family.
01:10:39.819,01:10:42.989,"If we had a daughter, we'd look for her, too."
01:10:43.031,01:10:44.699,"She'd miss us, too."
01:10:50.621,01:10:54.876,"Jen, I want you to be mine forever."
01:10:56.335,01:11:00.882,"What if I make my mark on the world, earn your parents' respect?"
01:11:00.924,01:11:03.467,We have a legend.
01:11:03.509,01:11:08.389,"Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will fulfill a wish of his."
01:11:08.431,01:11:12.185,"A long time ago, a man's parents were ill, so he jumped."
01:11:13.686,01:11:16.355,"He didn't die, wasn't even wounded."
01:11:18.024,01:11:20.777,"He just floated away, far away, never to return."
01:11:22.653,01:11:26.032,He knew his wish had come true.
01:11:26.074,01:11:29.202,"If you believe in it, it will happen."
01:11:29.244,01:11:34.665,"I've asked old people, they say, A sincere heart will make your dreams come true."
01:11:45.384,01:11:48.138,Keep it safe.
01:11:48.179,01:11:50.848,And return it to me when we are together again.
01:11:53.476,01:11:54.685,I will.
01:12:02.401,01:12:06.823,"If you don't return it to me, I will have to chase you down."
01:12:06.864,01:12:09.700,"And next time, I won't go easy on you."
01:12:21.420,01:12:25.466,"LO: Wherever I went, they always recognized me."
01:12:25.508,01:12:27.093,I really tried.
01:12:30.429,01:12:32.431,I heard you came to Beijing.
01:12:32.431,01:12:35.185,I was afraid I'd never see you again.
01:12:35.226,01:12:38.021,So I came.
01:12:38.062,01:12:40.648,I can't let you get married like that.
01:12:43.943,01:12:45.903,Go back.
01:12:45.945,01:12:47.197,Jen.
01:12:50.074,01:12:51.575,Don't ever come back.
01:12:51.617,01:12:53.911,This is it?
01:12:55.288,01:12:56.831,Yes.
01:13:12.555,01:13:14.515,MAID: We heard noises.
01:13:14.557,01:13:16.559,Fine. It was just a cat.
01:13:33.743,01:13:36.495,You think Jade Fox will show up?
01:13:36.495,01:13:38.748,She must be nearby.
01:13:38.789,01:13:41.625,But I doubt she'll show herself.
01:13:41.667,01:13:43.753,We'll keep our eyes open.
01:13:43.794,01:13:47.048,She'll come for the girl sooner or later.
01:14:06.776,01:14:08.652,Jen!
01:14:16.911,01:14:18.579,Go back to Xin Jiang with me.
01:14:23.960,01:14:26.254,LO: Let go of me!
01:14:29.173,01:14:32.969,"Jen, you can't marry someone else!"
01:14:33.010,01:14:34.678,You're mine!
01:14:34.720,01:14:36.597,Go back to Xin Jiang with me.
01:14:49.568,01:14:52.238,"Jen, come back to Xin Jiang with me!"
01:14:58.328,01:15:00.830,Tell me.
01:15:00.871,01:15:02.581,Come with me. Hurry.
01:15:05.835,01:15:09.046,SHU LIEN: You really thought she'd give it all up and go back west with you?
01:15:11.174,01:15:12.591,She's mine.
01:15:12.633,01:15:18.181,"LI MU BAI: Whether she's yours or not, you will be no good to her dead."
01:15:14.469,01:15:21.142,"With Gou and Yu hunting you, it won't be long until you're in their hands."
01:15:21.184,01:15:23.019,I don't care anymore.
01:15:24.979,01:15:28.232,"If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that."
01:15:30.318,01:15:33.321,Don't you want to see her again?
01:15:35.323,01:15:39.035,I'll write an introduction for you. Take it to Wudang Mountain.
01:15:39.076,01:15:41.287,Wait there for news from me.
01:15:43.498,01:15:44.707,Okay.
01:15:52.673,01:15:56.135,SIR TE: When will this end?
01:15:56.177,01:15:58.971,"They take it, put it back, and take it again."
01:15:59.013,01:16:02.475,My place is no better than a warehouse.
01:16:02.517,01:16:04.352,Come in.
01:16:06.020,01:16:07.646,Speak.
01:16:07.688,01:16:11.317,Jen Yu's run away.
01:16:11.359,01:16:17.031,Chief Yu requests your assistance since you know the Jiang Hu underworld so well.
01:16:17.073,01:16:19.700,He wants to find her and keep her from harm.
01:16:21.244,01:16:24.247,"Sir Te, leave this to us."
01:16:43.266,01:16:45.101,What can I serve you?
01:16:46.769,01:16:48.687,This cup is dirty.
01:17:03.411,01:17:08.332,Hi there.
01:17:09.459,01:17:10.709,Long.
01:17:12.545,01:17:15.839,It's young master Long.
01:17:15.881,01:17:18.842,I'm Iron Eagle Sung.
01:17:18.884,01:17:22.472,"This is my fellow brother, Flying Cougar Li Yun."
01:17:22.513,01:17:26.267,"What brings you to Huai An and where are you headed, Master Long?"
01:17:27.810,01:17:30.062,Anywhere there's action.
01:17:30.104,01:17:33.732,"In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance."
01:17:35.151,01:17:36.944,Don't bother.
01:17:38.404,01:17:41.115,You don't seem to be getting our drift.
01:17:42.783,01:17:45.244,So what if I don't?
01:17:45.286,01:17:49.415,We have ways of dealing with people who don't get it.
01:17:58.048,01:18:01.177,Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
01:18:03.262,01:18:05.389,He's my defeated foe.
01:18:24.033,01:18:25.326,SHU LIEN: Some tea.
01:18:54.938,01:18:56.815,Shu Lien.
01:18:56.815,01:18:59.527,There's no eternity to the things we can touch.
01:19:01.945,01:19:06.492,"My master used to say, There's nothing we can hold onto in this world."
01:19:08.452,01:19:12.956,Only by letting go can we finally possess what is real.
01:19:12.998,01:19:17.044,"Even to an old Taoist like you, not everything is an illusion."
01:19:17.086,01:19:20.590,"When you were holding my hand just now, wasn't that real?"
01:19:23.300,01:19:28.055,Your hand is cold and callused from practicing machetes.
01:19:28.097,01:19:32.727,"All these years, and I've never had the courage to touch it."
01:19:34.645,01:19:39.609,Crouching tigers and hidden dragons are in the underworld but so are human feelings.
01:19:39.650,01:19:43.571,"Swords and knives harbor unknown perils, but so do human relationships."
01:19:45.155,01:19:47.866,I gave away the Green Destiny with sincerity.
01:19:47.866,01:19:50.369,But it brought us more troubles.
01:19:50.411,01:19:53.289,Repressing your feelings will only make them stronger.
01:19:53.330,01:19:55.207,I can't repress my desire.
01:19:56.584,01:19:58.669,I want to be with you.
01:20:01.380,01:20:03.173,Just sitting like this...
01:20:04.841,01:20:06.969,...gives me a sense of peace.
01:20:25.362,01:20:27.030,Please follow me.
01:20:28.949,01:20:31.285,I want a clean room.
01:20:33.870,01:20:35.247,What would you like to eat?
01:20:35.289,01:20:40.461,"Some steamed cod, fried ribs, meatballs, not too big, with little starch!"
01:20:40.503,01:20:43.756,"And cabbage soup with shark fins, plus a bottle of warm rose wine."
01:20:43.798,01:20:47.050,I have to order them from a bigger restaurant.
01:20:47.092,01:20:49.345,Hurry then.
01:21:30.969,01:21:32.847,GANGSTER 1: It's him.
01:21:41.188,01:21:43.607,I am Iron Arm Mi.
01:21:43.649,01:21:46.026,I heard a true master has arrived.
01:21:46.068,01:21:49.154,I have come to seek a lesson.
01:22:02.125,01:22:04.253,You asked for it!
01:22:24.022,01:22:25.900,What kind of Iron Arm are you?
01:22:41.248,01:22:45.461,That's amazing technique!
01:22:45.502,01:22:48.464,Are you related to Southern Crane?
01:22:48.505,01:22:51.717,Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet.
01:22:51.759,01:22:54.637,Who could remember such lengthy names?
01:22:54.678,01:22:56.305,You!
01:22:56.346,01:23:01.101,"If Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, why don't you know his master?"
01:23:01.143,01:23:03.479,Who are you?
01:23:03.520,01:23:10.068,I'm Phoenix Mountain Gou.
01:23:10.068,01:23:12.905,Gou? I hate that name.
01:23:12.947,01:23:15.365,I feel like throwing up when I hear that name.
01:23:15.407,01:23:18.619,Too bad you're named Gou!
01:23:18.661,01:23:21.914,You'll be the first to taste my sword today.
01:23:42.225,01:23:47.105,Hold it!
01:23:47.105,01:23:48.691,A monk eating meat and not reading scriptures?
01:23:48.732,01:23:50.108,"You need a lesson, too."
01:23:50.108,01:23:51.902,Who the hell are you?
01:23:51.944,01:23:54.112,I am...
01:23:54.154,01:23:55.614,I am...
01:23:55.656,01:23:57.658,GANGSTER 2: Be careful of her sword!
01:24:00.452,01:24:03.163,...the invincible Sword Goddess...
01:24:04.790,01:24:09.169,...with the Green Destiny that has no equal...
01:24:14.132,01:24:16.552,...be it Li or Southern Eagle.
01:24:18.261,01:24:20.848,Lower your head and ask for mercy!
01:24:28.146,01:24:30.399,I'm the dragon from the desert...
01:24:39.616,01:24:42.411,...with no trace to be discovered in my wake.
01:24:52.796,01:24:56.050,Today I fly over Eh-Mei Mountain...
01:24:58.301,01:25:01.889,"...tomorrow, I'll uproot the last dregs of Wudang!"
01:25:17.487,01:25:23.326,"We politely asked for a friendly match, but she showed no respect and started to reproach and attack us."
01:25:23.368,01:25:27.205,My friends offered to come by and teach her a lesson.
01:25:27.247,01:25:29.207,MAN: Her sword is just too powerful.
01:25:29.207,01:25:33.087,"I've traveled far and wide, but I've never met anyone that uncivilized."
01:25:33.211,01:25:37.215,She kept accusing me of being the brother of Gou Jun Pei.
01:25:37.215,01:25:39.760,"Who is this guy Gou, anyway?"
01:25:41.678,01:25:43.472,Her husband.
01:25:55.400,01:25:57.653,Sun Security is nearby.
01:25:57.694,01:25:59.321,Why don't you go home and see how things are going?
01:25:59.362,01:26:00.739,What about you?
01:26:00.781,01:26:03.617,I'll look around and catch up later.
01:26:03.659,01:26:06.411,Not a bad idea. Let's stay at Sun Security tonight.
01:26:06.453,01:26:07.830,Get a good night's sleep.
01:26:07.871,01:26:09.581,Yes.
01:26:34.272,01:26:35.816,You are back.
01:26:40.529,01:26:42.405,"You're back, Master!"
01:26:43.866,01:26:46.035,"Hello, guys."
01:26:46.076,01:26:48.370,Things are fine.
01:26:48.411,01:26:50.039,Something came up.
01:26:50.080,01:26:52.290,"Wei, your wife was due?"
01:26:52.290,01:26:53.667,A girl? Good.
01:26:53.709,01:26:56.003,I'd be happy if she grows up like you.
01:26:56.045,01:26:58.130,Mrs. Wu.
01:26:58.172,01:26:59.965,You're back!
01:27:00.007,01:27:01.299,How's the arm?
01:27:01.341,01:27:03.343,Much better.
01:27:03.385,01:27:06.513,I've been worried about you.
01:27:06.555,01:27:09.307,"Mrs. Wu, Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night."
01:27:10.767,01:27:13.645,Really? I'll go and tidy up the room then.
01:27:42.925,01:27:44.342,Sister Yu!
01:27:50.974,01:27:54.352,You came to find me. Let's find you some proper clothes.
01:27:54.352,01:27:57.731,I'm just borrowing them.
01:27:59.357,01:28:01.526,You get around pretty well.
01:28:01.568,01:28:02.778,I don't think you need my clothes.
01:28:04.238,01:28:06.656,I just happened to be around.
01:28:06.698,01:28:09.367,I wanted to see how you're doing.
01:28:09.367,01:28:10.827,Sister...
01:28:13.663,01:28:19.419,"Now, now. With all the trouble you've caused, now you know what Jiang Hu life is really like."
01:28:19.461,01:28:22.798,"You came here, that means you think of me as your sister."
01:28:22.839,01:28:26.135,"If so, let me give you some sisterly advice."
01:28:26.176,01:28:29.805,"You don't have to marry, you can't just leave your parents."
01:28:29.846,01:28:32.474,But they're the ones who forced me to get married.
01:28:32.515,01:28:37.854,Go back to your parents first.
01:28:39.231,01:28:40.816,You know about Lo?
01:28:49.074,01:28:52.828,He really loves you.
01:28:52.869,01:28:55.122,Come back to Beijing with me.
01:28:55.164,01:28:57.540,We'll figure a way out for you.
01:29:01.211,01:29:03.130,Where is he now?
01:29:03.172,01:29:05.090,Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.
01:29:06.216,01:29:08.927,Li Mu Bai?
01:29:08.969,01:29:11.096,He sent him to Wudang Mountain.
01:29:11.138,01:29:14.808,"So, you're all working together to set me up."
01:29:14.850,01:29:17.019,Shut up!
01:29:17.060,01:29:19.479,"From the beginning, I knew you stole the Green Destiny!"
01:29:19.521,01:29:22.065,I've done nothing but protect you and your family.
01:29:22.107,01:29:25.027,And you've repaid me with nothing but contempt.
01:29:25.068,01:29:27.988,"Li Mu Bai spared you, and all you do is insult him."
01:29:28.030,01:29:31.491,"All we hoped for was a little peace, and you've ruined it for us!"
01:29:31.533,01:29:33.785,You're no sister of mine!
01:29:35.871,01:29:38.207,I don't give a damn.
01:29:38.248,01:29:40.876,Friendship is not real anyway.
01:29:40.917,01:29:44.880,"But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?"
01:29:47.341,01:29:49.092,Put the sword down.
01:29:59.728,01:30:01.063,Jen!
01:30:04.191,01:30:06.400,Everyone out.
01:30:17.579,01:30:19.581,Fine.
01:33:33.900,01:33:37.695,Don't touch it.
01:33:39.030,01:33:41.283,Come and get it if you can.
01:33:41.324,01:33:43.785,You just rely on the Green Destiny to do your fighting.
01:33:45.537,01:33:48.415,Don't blame the weapon if you can't fight me.
01:33:52.168,01:33:54.463,Go ahead. Take your pick.
01:33:54.504,01:33:56.131,I'll wait.
01:33:58.592,01:34:00.218,Go ahead.
01:34:54.856,01:34:56.525,Give me the sword.
01:34:58.568,01:34:59.986,Take it!
01:35:04.533,01:35:05.908,LI MU BAI: Stop!
01:35:09.162,01:35:10.830,You are not worthy of this sword.
01:35:10.872,01:35:13.416,Not another lecture!
01:35:15.460,01:35:16.794,Stop yourself before I do.
01:35:16.794,01:35:18.796,Now the sword will settle it.
01:35:55.083,01:35:59.254,I didn't force you at the monastery because I wanted to see the real you.
01:36:05.260,01:36:08.221,What do you know about seeing a true heart?
01:37:50.156,01:37:51.741,Why can't you leave me alone?
01:37:51.783,01:37:54.369,"I'll say it again, let me teach you."
01:38:27.652,01:38:33.783,"Okay, if you can take back the sword in three moves, I will go with you."
01:38:38.162,01:38:40.081,Give it back.
01:38:40.122,01:38:43.292,You wish.
01:39:58.075,01:40:01.830,It's only a matter of time before those guys get their revenge.
01:40:01.871,01:40:04.081,Your parents value their reputation.
01:40:04.081,01:40:05.583,They'll never take you back.
01:40:08.670,01:40:10.964,What good's a home?
01:40:11.004,01:40:13.925,Now we can go all the way together.
01:40:13.967,01:40:15.969,You'll always be my Lady.
01:40:19.054,01:40:22.600,"After all, happiness is the most important thing in life, isn't it?"
01:40:22.642,01:40:26.270,We'll be our own masters at last.
01:40:26.312,01:40:29.357,"All we have left is each other, isn't that so?"
01:40:34.153,01:40:35.989,Now lie down and rest.
01:40:58.845,01:41:01.848,"Crazy girl like that, you should have killed her."
01:41:01.890,01:41:04.099,I didn't have the heart to do it.
01:41:04.141,01:41:06.227,Maybe Li Mu Bai can do it.
01:42:17.214,01:42:19.467,Is it me or the sword you want?
01:42:39.904,01:42:41.990,You've been drugged.
01:42:59.298,01:43:01.676,Where's Jade Fox?
01:43:43.885,01:43:45.803,What's going on?
01:43:45.845,01:43:49.057,Jade Fox drugged her.
01:43:49.098,01:43:50.808,How did you get here?
01:43:53.144,01:43:56.313,We followed Jade Fox.
01:43:57.940,01:43:59.358,Watch out!
01:44:09.493,01:44:11.620,Governess!
01:44:25.176,01:44:27.095,This is the end of the road.
01:44:29.430,01:44:31.099,For you too.
01:44:39.523,01:44:41.234,A poisoned needle!
01:44:45.071,01:44:46.781,You deserve to die...
01:44:48.616,01:44:53.246,but I was really aiming at Jen.
01:44:55.206,01:45:00.878,Ten years I sacrificed but you deceived me.
01:45:00.920,01:45:04.215,You hid the book's true meaning. I never improved...
01:45:05.716,01:45:09.386,...but your progress was limitless.
01:45:11.555,01:45:14.391,You know what poison is?
01:45:14.391,01:45:17.645,An 8-year-old girl who's full of deceit!
01:45:17.686,01:45:19.396,That's poison!
01:45:23.276,01:45:24.443,Jen!
01:45:26.403,01:45:30.699,"My only love, my only enemy!"
01:45:40.251,01:45:43.712,"You can't die! Tell us, what poison did you use?"
01:45:43.754,01:45:45.881,What poison?
01:45:45.923,01:45:48.717,"You can't die, tell us the antidote!"
01:45:48.759,01:45:51.553,You can't let him die!
01:45:51.595,01:45:52.972,JEN YU: It's the Purple Yin Poison.
01:45:53.014,01:45:54.682,What?
01:45:54.723,01:45:58.435,Purple Yin Poison.
01:46:01.063,01:46:04.525,My blood will stop flowing within two hours.
01:46:06.443,01:46:09.197,It's the same poison that killed my master.
01:46:10.948,01:46:12.616,There's no antidote.
01:46:12.658,01:46:14.743,There must be an antidote!
01:46:14.785,01:46:18.455,Every living thing has its antithesis. And not this?
01:46:19.623,01:46:23.044,There is.
01:46:23.085,01:46:27.715,"The recipe isn't complicated, but the ingredients are hard to find. It takes time."
01:46:34.471,01:46:36.682,"Please, trust me."
01:46:36.724,01:46:39.727,"As you have helped me, let me help him."
01:46:42.479,01:46:44.940,All right. Hurry up.
01:46:44.982,01:46:47.318,Maybe I can hold on for two hours.
01:46:47.360,01:46:49.945,Ride my horse to headquarters.
01:46:49.987,01:46:52.948,Give this to Mrs. Wu.
01:46:52.990,01:46:54.616,Save your breath.
01:46:54.658,01:46:56.660,Guard your energy.
01:47:21.977,01:47:23.271,MAN: Who is this?
01:47:25.940,01:47:28.734,Mrs. Wu!
01:47:28.776,01:47:31.153,Stop it!
01:47:31.195,01:47:34.282,Yu gave me this and told me to come to you.
01:47:34.323,01:47:36.784,Let her come in!
01:47:50.756,01:47:52.967,"Mu Bai, hold on."
01:47:57.596,01:47:59.307,Give me some hope.
01:48:24.290,01:48:25.749,Shu Lien.
01:48:27.251,01:48:29.295,Don't waste your breath.
01:48:31.297,01:48:33.174,My life is departing.
01:48:35.050,01:48:37.052,I've only one breath left.
01:48:39.596,01:48:42.766,Use your last bit of strength to meditate.
01:48:42.808,01:48:47.188,Free yourself from this world as you've been taught.
01:48:48.939,01:48:53.027,Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.
01:48:55.279,01:48:58.366,Don't waste it on me.
01:49:01.910,01:49:03.996,I've already wasted my whole life.
01:49:05.789,01:49:08.625,I want to tell you with my remaining strength...
01:49:10.461,01:49:13.339,...that I love you.
01:49:48.665,01:49:55.714,I'll drift next to you every day as a ghost just to be with you.
01:49:58.509,01:50:01.720,Even if I was banished to the darkest place...
01:50:04.348,01:50:05.682,...my love...
01:50:09.144,01:50:12.940,...will keep me from being a lonely spirit.
01:51:09.163,01:51:11.248,He's gone?
01:51:39.943,01:51:44.781,"Bo, please take this sword back to Sir Te's."
01:51:51.997,01:51:56.043,You may go to Wudang Mountain.
01:51:57.794,01:52:05.469,"Promise me whatever path you decide to take in this life, be true to yourself."
01:52:52.683,01:52:54.643,Jen!
01:53:54.745,01:53:56.622,Jen.
01:53:59.500,01:54:02.461,Remember the story you told me in the desert?
01:54:04.421,01:54:07.341,"Have faith, then the dreams will come true."
01:54:13.681,01:54:15.724,"Make a wish, Lo."
01:54:17.976,01:54:21.563,"I wish that we'll be in the desert, together again."
