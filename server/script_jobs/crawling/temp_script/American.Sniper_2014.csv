00:03:04.100,00:03:05.101,"Oh, she's got a grenade."
00:03:05.184,00:03:07.604,"She got a RKG Russian grenade, she just handed to the kid."

00:04:32.605,00:04:36.150,Our lives unfold before us like puzzling reflections in a mirror.

00:04:46.953,00:04:48.288,Let us pray.
00:04:49.289,00:04:52.709,WAYNE: There are three types of people in this world.
00:04:52.792,00:04:55.378,"Sheep, wolves, and sheepdogs."
00:04:56.963,00:05:01.759,"Now, some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world."
00:05:01.843,00:05:05.763,"And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn't know how to protect themselves."
00:05:05.847,00:05:07.014,Those are the sheep.
00:05:08.558,00:05:10.142,And then you got predators.
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.269,They use violence to prey on the weak.
00:05:13.855,00:05:15.022,They're the wolves.
00:05:15.106,00:05:16.316,"Come on, Jeff, punch him."
00:05:16.399,00:05:23.155,And then there are those who've been blessed with the gift of aggression and the overpowering need to protect the flock.
00:05:24.907,00:05:28.870,These men are the rare breed that live to confront the wolf.
00:05:30.622,00:05:32.499,They are the sheepdog.
00:05:34.834,00:05:37.920,"Now, we're not raising any sheep in this family."
00:05:39.296,00:05:40.923,And I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf.
00:05:41.007,00:05:42.174,Wayne.
00:05:47.013,00:05:48.931,But we protect our own.
00:05:50.266,00:05:57.189,"If someone tries to fight you or tries to bully your little brother, you have my permission to finish it."
00:05:57.273,00:05:59.442,The guy was picking on Jeff.
00:06:00.485,00:06:01.903,Is that true?
00:06:02.236,00:06:04.030,"Yes, sir. Yes, he was."
00:06:06.073,00:06:07.492,Did you finish it?

00:13:27.806,00:13:30.684,Only a few more hours and you're Navy SEALs.
00:13:33.770,00:13:36.565,TONY: These are the tools that'll make a man die!
00:13:36.648,00:13:39.401,RECRUITS: These are the tools that'll make a man die!
00:13:39.568,00:13:41.153,"I'm the only one who's hit one, so..."
00:13:44.073,00:13:45.491,"Oh, yeah! Chris, your turn, man."
00:13:45.574,00:13:46.575,I think you got one more.
00:13:46.658,00:13:48.077,"Oh, I got one more? All right. All right. One more."
00:13:48.160,00:13:49.328,"Here we go, here we go."
00:13:51.705,00:13:54.500,"DAUBER: Hey, if we want a smaller target, we'll use your arm, man."
00:13:57.294,00:13:59.296,-Hello. -Hi.
00:14:00.381,00:14:02.174,How ya doin'?
00:14:02.258,00:14:03.800,Good. Thank you.
00:14:06.220,00:14:08.514,"Can I, uh, get you a drink?"
00:14:08.597,00:14:12.393,Will a drink make you six inches taller and charming?
00:14:12.476,00:14:13.936,Will it make you not married?
00:14:14.395,00:14:15.396,I'm not...
00:14:15.479,00:14:18.232,"Yeah, I just watched you take your ring off, okay?"
00:14:18.315,00:14:20.484,Don't be a scumbag. Go home.
00:14:23.529,00:14:24.947,"Oh, my God."
00:14:27.824,00:14:29.911,It may have been the leather pants.
00:14:29.994,00:14:31.370,"Oh, yeah?"
00:14:32.371,00:14:35.541,What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone?
00:14:35.624,00:14:37.459,"Well, maybe corduroy."
00:14:38.210,00:14:40.046,"I mean, is that how it is with you guys?"
00:14:40.129,00:14:43.049,"You're, like, suddenly single after three beers?"
00:14:43.132,00:14:45.717,"Oh, no, after three beers all I know is to get a fourth."
00:14:46.343,00:14:48.720,"Oh, that's great. That's great."
00:14:48.804,00:14:50.014,Real redneck.
00:14:50.097,00:14:51.515,"Oh, I'm not a redneck, I'm from Texas."
00:14:51.598,00:14:53.809,Mmm. What's the difference?
00:14:54.351,00:14:57.229,"Well, we ride horses, and they ride their cousins."
00:14:58.147,00:15:00.149,What do you do for work? You're obviously military.
00:15:00.232,00:15:02.609,"Oh, uh, I polish dolphins. They're in captivity."
00:15:02.693,00:15:04.820,What I do is just sort of scrape off the crustaceans...
00:15:04.904,00:15:06.738,Do I look stupid to you?
00:15:06.989,00:15:09.033,"No, honestly, you look a little sad."
00:15:13.162,00:15:15.289,Am I tall enough to buy you a drink?
00:15:15.372,00:15:17.166,Not until you tell me what you do.
00:15:17.249,00:15:19.835,"Okay, how 'bout this. Hey, Greg? Get two shots?"
00:15:19.919,00:15:21.378,How 'bout we do a shot for a question.
00:15:21.462,00:15:25.424,"Every time you ask me a question that I answer, -you gotta do a shot. Same, vice versa. -Game on."
00:15:26.342,00:15:27.884,"You can leave the bottle, too."
00:15:27.969,00:15:29.636,"Okay, shoot."
00:15:31.347,00:15:33.349,You're obviously military. What branch?
00:15:33.432,00:15:36.560,"I just finished BUD/S, headin' to sniper school."
00:15:36.643,00:15:38.104,Are you kiddin' me? You're a SEAL?
00:15:38.354,00:15:39.730,"Yes, ma'am."
00:15:41.648,00:15:44.026,-That's two questions. -Shit.
00:15:45.361,00:15:46.737,Really?
00:15:49.740,00:15:51.783,"Oh, I didn't really mean you had to do that."
00:15:54.578,00:15:55.704,I know all about you guys.
00:15:55.787,00:15:57.581,My sister was engaged to a SEAL.
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.125,"-Oh, was she? -Yeah."
00:15:59.208,00:16:00.709,-Mmm. -Mmm-hmm.
00:16:00.792,00:16:02.294,"Hold on, how you know all about us?"
00:16:02.378,00:16:03.462,What do you mean?
00:16:03.545,00:16:10.052,"What I mean is, you're a bunch of arrogant, self-centered pricks who think you can lie and cheat and do whatever the fuck you want."
00:16:10.136,00:16:11.303,I'd never date a SEAL.
00:16:12.638,00:16:13.973,"Wait, why would you say I'm self-centered?"
00:16:14.056,00:16:15.807,I'd lay down my life for my country.
00:16:16.225,00:16:17.268,Why?
00:16:17.351,00:16:20.604,'Cause it's the greatest country on Earth and I'd do everything I can to protect it.
00:16:20.687,00:16:23.607,"Look, I'm sorry what happened to your sister, but that's not me."
00:16:25.401,00:16:26.943,It's nice to meet you.
00:16:27.444,00:16:28.529,Where you goin'?
00:16:28.612,00:16:31.657,"I was just gonna go home because you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so..."
00:16:33.117,00:16:35.077,Said I'd never marry one.
00:16:36.078,00:16:38.622,"Oh. Oh, okay. Well, then, maybe, hello."
00:16:38.705,00:16:40.666,Nice to meet you. What's your name?
00:16:40.749,00:16:42.376,-Taya. -Taya.
00:16:42.918,00:16:44.711,Chris. I'm Chris Kyle. Nice to meet you.
00:16:44.878,00:16:46.213,Pleasure.
00:16:47.881,00:16:51.843,"I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?"
00:16:52.303,00:17:02.063,"Well, our BUD/S office commander said Okay. He said there's three things we gotta worry about, ego, booze, and women."
00:17:02.146,00:17:04.940,"Well, it sounds like you're under attack."
00:17:08.444,00:17:09.945,CHRIS: You're pretty.
00:17:10.529,00:17:12.406,You're so beautiful.
00:17:19.538,00:17:20.747,Hey.
00:17:31.300,00:17:33.635,"I'm not going home with you, so don't even think about it."
00:17:43.937,00:17:46.440,Feel breath filling every cell in your body.
00:17:49.068,00:17:50.277,This is our ritual.
00:17:50.819,00:17:53.405,"We master our breath, we master our mind."
00:17:55.241,00:17:58.202,Pulling the trigger will become an unconscious effort.
00:17:58.285,00:18:01.163,"You will be aware of it, but not directing it."
00:18:01.247,00:18:07.086,"And as you exhale, find your natural respiratory pause and the space between heartbeats."
00:18:24.103,00:18:25.937,"VOICEMAIL: Hey, this is Taya. I can't get to the phone."
00:18:26.021,00:18:27.481,Leave a message. I'll call you back.
00:18:27.564,00:18:28.815,"CHRIS: Hey, it's me again."
00:18:28.899,00:18:31.110,That guy whose shoes you puked on.
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.987,"So, uh, yeah, I was thinking maybe you didn't get that last message?"
00:18:34.070,00:18:36.865,"The last message I left, or the one before that."
00:18:36.948,00:18:38.825,-So I figured that... -You figured what?
00:18:38.909,00:18:41.495,Hey. How are you? How've you been?
00:18:42.871,00:18:45.124,-Good. -Good. Uh...
00:18:45.207,00:18:46.917,"Wow, uh, what are you up to?"
00:18:48.252,00:18:50.379,Not a lot. You?
00:18:50.754,00:18:53.340,"Uh, no, just excited to talk to you."
00:19:02.391,00:19:03.892,"KARNAN: Aim small, miss small."
00:19:03.975,00:19:06.437,"If you aim for a shirt button, you might miss by two inches."
00:19:06.895,00:19:08.980,"If you aim for a shirt, you might miss by two feet."
00:19:16.697,00:19:18.199,"You better close those groupings, Kyle."
00:19:18.282,00:19:19.533,"Yes, sir."
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.081,Not bad. What do we get for that?
00:19:26.165,00:19:27.833,-SHOPKEEPER: Top shelf. -I like that one.
00:19:27.916,00:19:29.125,-Brown one. -SHOPKEEPER: Sure.
00:19:29.210,00:19:30.252,-There you go. -Great.
00:19:30.336,00:19:31.337,"-Aw, look! -Thank you, sir."
00:19:31.420,00:19:32.671,-Have a good day. -Thank you.
00:19:32.754,00:19:34.130,"-Hello. -Aw, good."
00:19:34.215,00:19:35.882,That looks good on you.
00:19:35.966,00:19:37.884,"So, did you always want to be a soldier?"
00:19:37.968,00:19:41.347,"Oh. Uh, no, I wanted to be a cowboy, but..."
00:19:41.430,00:19:43.599,"I don't know. I did that, and I thought I was meant for something more."
00:19:43.682,00:19:46.643,Mmm. So you started rescuing girls from bars?
00:19:46.977,00:19:48.437,I think I rescued that bar from you.
00:19:51.190,00:19:53.108,You like country music?
00:19:57.238,00:19:58.989,How about kids? You want kids?
00:19:59.072,00:20:00.156,"Yeah, someday."
00:20:01.533,00:20:03.869,My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men.
00:20:05.246,00:20:07.623,"Well, that's a shitty thing to say to a girl."
00:20:07.706,00:20:09.082,"Well, I've proven her right."
00:20:10.041,00:20:14.713,"Them wrong picks put you here, made you who you are."
00:20:15.088,00:20:16.590,I like who you are.
00:20:18.467,00:20:21.887,You ever think about what happens when there's a real person on the end of that gun?
00:20:22.429,00:20:23.430,I don't know.
00:20:23.514,00:20:25.724,I just hope I can do my job when that day comes.
00:20:38.612,00:20:40.614,Are we looking at the same target?
00:20:40.697,00:20:42.991,You're spittin' dust. And don't worry.
00:20:43.074,00:20:45.494,We can always use corpsmen for the guys who can't shoot.
00:20:47.621,00:20:48.997,"Oh, fuck."
00:21:13.980,00:21:15.316,You're trembling.
00:21:15.399,00:21:16.775,I know. I...
00:21:18.026,00:21:20.612,"-We don't have to do this. -No, I want to. I do."
00:21:20.696,00:21:23.156,"-Yeah? -You just feel real, and it scares me."
00:21:34.460,00:21:36.628,You got your off-eye shut?
00:21:36.712,00:21:39.340,"Well, if I close my off-eye, then I can't see what's out there."
00:21:39.423,00:21:41.007,There's nothing out there but the target.
00:21:41.091,00:21:43.427,"CHRIS: Negative, sir. There is something out there."
00:21:43.510,00:21:44.803,Punch it.
00:21:47.473,00:21:49.224,"Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe."
00:21:56.732,00:21:58.484,I'm better when it's breathin'.
00:22:02.153,00:22:03.947,"-another passenger plane. -TAYA: Oh, my God. Chris."
00:22:04.030,00:22:05.949,-What's wrong? -TAYA: No!
00:22:06.575,00:22:10.954,ANNOUNCER: Here is the tape. You see the first plane coming in from what looks like the east side.
00:22:11.037,00:22:12.247,"Oh, my God."
00:22:12.331,00:22:16.835,And it goes into the building with the flames and the smoke billowing out the other side of the tower.
00:22:16.918,00:22:23.717,"It's hard for me to tell exactly which is the north side and which is the south side, but it appears it's coming out of the north side there."
00:22:23.800,00:22:26.762,"And then, moments ago, these incredible images..."
00:22:26.845,00:22:28.389,And I believe that's the first tower.
00:22:28.472,00:22:30.891,That's the south tower collapsing.
00:22:31.850,00:22:38.524,"It almost looks like one of those implosions of buildings that you see, except there is nothing controlled about this."
00:22:38.774,00:22:40.651,This is devastation.
00:22:50.326,00:22:52.579,-You hardly even know me. -I know enough.
00:22:52.663,00:22:54.956,"You are a package deal, babe."
00:23:00.170,00:23:02.213,What are you so afraid of?
00:23:02.297,00:23:03.757,Nothing.
00:23:05.509,00:23:08.887,"Everything, I don't know. What if it doesn't work out?"
00:23:10.764,00:23:14.225,"We're gonna get married, and then we're gonna start a family."
00:23:14.309,00:23:16.895,"You got it all planned out, don't you?"
00:23:17.646,00:23:19.189,I'm done.
00:23:20.148,00:23:21.525,I love you.
00:23:23.735,00:23:26.447,"Well, you're gonna need a ring, if you wanna talk all tough like that."
00:23:26.530,00:23:27.864,Okay.
00:23:37.708,00:23:40.043,"MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!"
00:23:51.221,00:23:52.806,What the hell is on your neck?
00:23:52.889,00:23:53.932,-Hmm? -Your neck.
00:23:54.015,00:23:55.559,"You got, like, green paint all over you."
00:23:55.934,00:24:00.606,"Would you believe me, babe, if I told you that I had an IV and I was all green about two hours ago?"
00:24:00.689,00:24:02.273,What are you... What?
00:24:02.357,00:24:04.109,"It's a package deal, babe."
00:24:04.192,00:24:05.276,"Oh, my God."
00:24:05.360,00:24:06.653,"Come here, you."
00:24:09.280,00:24:11.825,"Cheers to that. What's the word, chief?"
00:24:13.494,00:24:15.370,"Just got the call, boys."
00:24:18.665,00:24:20.458,BIGGLES: Shots. SQUIRREL: Shots.
00:24:27.841,00:24:29.217,Yeah! Whoo!
00:24:33.054,00:24:34.389,"It's only gonna be six weeks, baby."
00:24:34.472,00:24:35.932,"-I'm so afraid, baby. -That's what they say."
00:24:36.016,00:24:37.267,You got nothin' to be afraid of.
00:24:37.350,00:24:39.185,-What are you... -It's all part of the plan.
00:24:40.604,00:24:43.148,Your heart is beating out of your chest.
00:24:44.440,00:24:47.569,"That's just 'cause I'm not the only one who's going to war, that's all."
00:25:03.418,00:25:04.961,MARC: Welcome to Fallujah.
00:25:05.045,00:25:07.255,The new Wild West of the old Middle East.
00:25:07.338,00:25:13.386,"AQI put a price on your heads, and now extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it."
00:25:13.469,00:25:22.353,"You snipers, you're gonna be paired with a Marine to watch your back, and inserted along the main road to do overwatch for first Marines going door to door."
00:25:22.437,00:25:25.356,Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs.
00:25:25.440,00:25:27.442,The city has been evacuated.
00:25:27.693,00:25:32.072,Any military-age male who is still here is here to kill you.
00:25:32.864,00:25:36.577,Let's bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home.
00:25:53.802,00:25:55.428,"MARC: Out, out, out!"
00:25:57.681,00:25:59.683,"WINSTON: I'd keep that head down, Tex."
00:26:00.726,00:26:02.477,"Muj's got snipers, too, you know."
00:26:03.353,00:26:05.606,A sniper won't aim for your head.
00:26:08.149,00:26:12.738,"Man, they got this one sniper that's been hitting headshots from 500 yards out."
00:26:16.742,00:26:18.702,They call him Mustafa.
00:26:20.120,00:26:22.038,He was in the Olympics.
00:26:22.413,00:26:24.499,They got snipin' in the Olympics now?
00:26:38.764,00:26:43.810,"Hold on, I got a woman and a kid, 200 yards out, movin' towards the convoy."
00:26:48.815,00:26:51.151,Her arms aren't swingin'. She's carrying somethin'.
00:27:00.911,00:27:01.870,"Oh, she's got a grenade."
00:27:01.953,00:27:04.164,"She got a RKG Russian grenade, she just handed to the kid."
00:27:04.497,00:27:05.957,COMMANDING OFFICER: You say a woman and a kid?
00:27:07.292,00:27:08.794,You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?
00:27:09.127,00:27:10.921,Negative. You know the ROE.
00:27:11.004,00:27:13.548,-Your call. -They fry you if you're wrong.
00:27:13.631,00:27:15.508,They send your ass to Leavenworth.
00:27:58.384,00:28:00.678,"Oh, fucking evil bitch."
00:28:01.012,00:28:03.514,OFFICER: Get up. Keep moving.
00:28:03.974,00:28:06.142,"COMMANDING OFFICER: Nice shooting, Tex. Hell of a call."
00:28:06.226,00:28:07.811,"COMMANDER: Roger that. Good looking out, Navy."
00:28:08.144,00:28:10.856,"-Fuck, you hear that, man? -Get the fuck off me."
00:28:37.465,00:28:38.549,CHRIS: Where is everybody?
00:28:38.633,00:28:40.051,"Oh, we're just picking our dicks here, man."
00:28:40.135,00:28:42.553,We're training those fucking Haji soldiers.
00:28:42.637,00:28:43.847,"Hey, why aren't you out there?"
00:28:45.015,00:28:46.641,"Well, I have the shits."
00:28:46.725,00:28:48.810,What? From reading a comic book?
00:28:49.477,00:28:51.146,"It's a fucking graphic novel, man."
00:28:51.229,00:28:52.480,It's a big difference.
00:28:55.191,00:28:56.943,I heard you were on fucking fire out there.
00:28:57.027,00:28:59.780,"Marc Lee came in, said you popped your cherry."
00:28:59.863,00:29:01.031,Is that right?
00:29:01.281,00:29:07.203,"There was a kid who barely had any hair on his balls, mother gives him a grenade."
00:29:15.420,00:29:17.923,"Dude, that was evil like I never seen before."
00:29:20.591,00:29:23.511,"you know that kid coulda taken out, like, 10 fucking Marines, right?"
00:29:23.594,00:29:24.720,"Yeah, but I killed him."
00:29:24.805,00:29:27.808,You did your job. That's the end of the story.
00:29:27.891,00:29:30.560,"Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned that first one to go down."
00:29:47.618,00:29:49.996,"Fuck, man. What the hell?"
00:29:51.081,00:29:53.083,"That was your overwatch, Einstein."
00:29:53.416,00:29:54.960,You can thank him later.
00:29:58.213,00:29:59.630,Let's move!
00:30:00.590,00:30:03.218,MARINE: He's gone. He's gone. Hurry up.
00:30:16.606,00:30:18.316,Contact! Front disperse!
00:30:28.910,00:30:29.953,MARC: Cease fire!
00:30:48.429,00:30:49.555,Whoa.
00:32:22.941,00:32:25.443,MARINE 1: Eyes on the rooftops. Keep your eyes up there.
00:32:25.776,00:32:26.945,MARINE 2: Breacher up!
00:32:44.670,00:32:45.796,MARINE 3: Man down! Man down!
00:32:45.880,00:32:48.216,We need a corpsman over here now.
00:32:49.925,00:32:53.929,"Approximate grid, Quebec-Romeo-1-5-5-6-0-4."
00:33:04.274,00:33:05.400,"DAUBER: Yeah, well."
00:33:05.483,00:33:06.651,"MARC: You covered our asses out there, man."
00:33:06.734,00:33:07.986,Some ballsy shots.
00:33:12.157,00:33:14.492,Fuckin' sniper went right up our ass.
00:33:14.575,00:33:16.202,"Yeah, I already chewed out security detail."
00:33:16.286,00:33:17.328,Ain't gonna happen again.
00:33:17.412,00:33:18.704,It better not happen again.
00:33:18.788,00:33:20.040,There's a hot spot 400 meters out.
00:33:20.123,00:33:21.124,All right.
00:33:21.207,00:33:22.750,I'm gonna go write up some shooter statements.
00:33:22.833,00:33:24.127,How many did you get?
00:33:24.252,00:33:25.586,I got six. Well...
00:33:25.670,00:33:29.257,"That's not true. I got eight, but they dragged two off."
00:33:29.882,00:33:31.051,You got six?
00:33:31.134,00:33:33.011,"-Yeah, why? What's wrong? -Nothing."
00:33:33.094,00:33:34.762,You just got more than the rest of the snipers combined.
00:33:34.845,00:33:36.597,"Yeah, but they got one of us."
00:33:36.681,00:33:38.474,You can't shoot what you can't see.
00:33:40.518,00:33:42.853,His wife said he was carrying a Koran.
00:33:42.978,00:33:46.982,"Look, I don't know what a Koran looks like, but I can tell you what he was carrying."
00:33:47.067,00:33:51.404,"It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s, and it looked just like an AK-47."
00:33:51.487,00:33:52.905,So you tell me what he was carrying.
00:34:04.750,00:34:06.044,"BIGGLES: Oh, here he comes. Here he comes."
00:34:06.127,00:34:07.962,"Ladies and genitals, listen up!"
00:34:08.046,00:34:09.172,We have a legend in our midst.
00:34:09.255,00:34:11.591,Round of applause for The Legend.
00:34:12.007,00:34:14.885,"There we go. We're so proud of you back home on the range, boy."
00:34:14.969,00:34:16.346,"Now, it's been said..."
00:34:16.429,00:34:20.558,It's been said that The Legend here can kill 100 men with one blow.
00:34:20.766,00:34:21.976,"Or, no, it was, uh..."
00:34:22.060,00:34:23.394,"No, fuck, what was it?"
00:34:23.478,00:34:25.938,One... One blow from a single man.
00:34:26.064,00:34:29.275,"He blew 100 men, and he's single."
00:34:29.400,00:34:30.360,And... Oh!
00:34:30.443,00:34:32.070,Fuck! Damn it! Shit.
00:34:32.570,00:34:33.904,"Oh, shit!"
00:34:33.988,00:34:36.949,"BIGGLES: Damn, man! You want a food fight?"
00:34:37.075,00:34:38.826,Come on.
00:34:38.909,00:34:40.870,Only way to shut you up.
00:34:46.417,00:34:50.505,"CHRIS: That is not the way the call home is supposed to go, babe."
00:34:50.588,00:34:53.174,Don't be weird with me. Seriously.
00:34:53.924,00:34:55.593,I want you to tell me everything.
00:34:56.677,00:34:59.639,"Well, there's certain things you just can't say over the phone."
00:35:00.098,00:35:01.724,"Okay, you knocked me up, right?"
00:35:01.807,00:35:06.937,"And I'm sitting here by myself, literally assembling baby cribs, and you can't talk to me?"
00:35:13.778,00:35:17.115,I can't stop thinking about that little pink number you wore on our honeymoon.
00:35:19.033,00:35:20.785,"Yeah, it's called a nightgown."
00:35:24.122,00:35:26.166,And three days?
00:35:26.291,00:35:29.252,Three days is not a honeymoon.
00:35:29.335,00:35:31.879,"Well, it was a good three days."
00:35:36.301,00:35:38.093,I miss you real bad.
00:35:38.844,00:35:40.305,"I miss you, too."
00:35:40.805,00:35:42.932,"Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?"
00:35:43.015,00:35:44.475,Yeah. Hold on.
00:35:44.559,00:35:45.810,Hold on a second. Let me...
00:35:49.189,00:35:54.402,"But I got a phone in one hand and a gun in the other, so I don't know what I'm gonna do."
00:35:54.485,00:35:57.322,"Well, you're gonna have to decide what's more important, baby."
00:36:01.492,00:36:03.578,Fat and horny. It's fucking disgusting.
00:36:05.037,00:36:07.540,"If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you."
00:36:10.918,00:36:12.420,How's my boy?
00:36:13.003,00:36:15.423,Nobody said it's a boy.
00:36:15.506,00:36:18.384,I can't wait to see the way you're gonna be with him.
00:36:18.509,00:36:19.844,How do you know?
00:36:21.679,00:36:23.181,I just know.
00:36:24.014,00:36:25.391,I can sense it.
00:36:25.891,00:36:27.685,I hope you're right.
00:36:27.768,00:36:29.354,"Baby, I am right."
00:36:32.232,00:36:34.317,"Hey, did your dad get a hold of you?"
00:36:34.400,00:36:36.194,"No, I haven't checked my e-mails."
00:36:36.277,00:36:37.737,Shit.
00:36:37.862,00:36:40.072,"Okay, you need to hang up and call him, all right?"
00:36:40.198,00:36:41.949,"-Why, what's wrong? -Fuck, I'm so selfish."
00:36:42.032,00:36:43.284,I wasn't even thinking.
00:36:43.368,00:36:44.785,"Taya, what's wrong?"
00:36:45.035,00:36:46.537,What happened?
00:36:47.872,00:36:49.665,Your little brother deployed.
00:36:50.250,00:36:51.751,What do you mean? What happened to Jump School?
00:36:51.834,00:36:52.918,"No, he didn't get in."
00:36:53.002,00:36:55.296,"You just hang up and call your dad, okay?"
00:36:55.380,00:36:58.341,Wait. What do you mean? Deployed where? Where is he?
00:36:58.591,00:37:00.050,Over there.
00:37:01.302,00:37:03.263,He's headed to Iraq.
00:37:03.929,00:37:05.556,"I'm sorry, honey."
00:37:10.228,00:37:13.481,The man with the blade? He's a Jordanian militant.
00:37:13.564,00:37:15.233,He's funded by bin Laden.
00:37:15.316,00:37:18.068,He's trained by bin Laden. He is loyal to bin Laden.
00:37:18.569,00:37:21.155,His name is Zarqawi.
00:37:22.282,00:37:26.619,Now this asshole is right now the crown prince of al-Qaeda in Iraq.
00:37:28.246,00:37:30.665,"His mercenary army, AQI?"
00:37:30.748,00:37:31.749,"They're 5,000 strong."
00:37:31.832,00:37:33.876,"Now, these guys are not your average shit-kickers."
00:37:33.959,00:37:40.174,"These guys are well-trained, they are well-paid, and right now, they're waging the largest urban assault since Vietnam."
00:37:41.842,00:37:45.930,"Zarqawi and his lieutenants, these are our top priority."
00:37:46.013,00:37:56.691,"Now, there is only one way to root these guys out, and that is to go door to door, house to house, until we find them or we find someone who will give us their whereabouts."
00:37:57.191,00:38:04.365,"So we are going to need to clear 10 structures an hour, which, I know, is a lot. It's aggressive."
00:38:04.449,00:38:07.285,We're gonna be loosening things up with air support.
00:38:07.618,00:38:11.121,This is the highest priority target we have to date.
00:38:11.622,00:38:14.584,I want this asshole dead or captured.
00:38:14.667,00:38:17.962,Do you understand? Are there any questions?
00:38:22.633,00:38:26.804,"I'll tell you something, these Marines keep rushing in like they're doing, they're gonna have their asses shot off."
00:38:26.887,00:38:27.930,"Well, they're Marines."
00:38:28.013,00:38:29.056,They don't get the training we do.
00:38:29.139,00:38:30.891,Half these guys were civilians six months ago.
00:38:30.975,00:38:32.226,"Well, let's coach 'em up."
00:38:32.310,00:38:33.478,I'll show 'em how team guys do it.
00:38:33.561,00:38:34.645,I'll lead the unit on the street.
00:38:34.729,00:38:36.564,"No, we can't do that. We need you on overwatch."
00:38:36.647,00:38:38.273,"Come on. If I'm on the street, Marc..."
00:38:38.358,00:38:41.276,"Look, house to house is the deadliest job here, man."
00:38:41.361,00:38:43.404,You got some sort of savior complex?
00:38:43.488,00:38:46.407,"I just want to get the bad guys, but if I can't see 'em, I can't shoot 'em."
00:38:46.491,00:38:49.910,"Look, all these guys? They know your name, and they feel invincible with you up there."
00:38:49.994,00:38:51.036,They're not.
00:38:51.120,00:38:52.872,They are if they think they are.
00:38:52.955,00:38:54.415,Why don't you just keep banging on the long gun.
00:38:54.499,00:38:57.001,We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.
00:39:07.512,00:39:13.100,"CHRIS: You said AQI has a sniper in the Olympics, but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter in three games."
00:39:13.518,00:39:16.186,"Well, that's 'cause Mustafa's not Iraqi."
00:39:18.356,00:39:19.940,He's from Syria.
00:39:29.199,00:39:30.535,MARINE 1: Breacher up!
00:39:31.452,00:39:36.290,"Hey, once you all gain entry, I can't see shit, so take it slow and move through your target."
00:39:37.500,00:39:38.751,MARINE 2: Fire in the hole!
00:39:39.544,00:39:40.961,"Go, go, go!"
00:39:49.387,00:39:50.555,MARINE 2: Man down!
00:39:52.347,00:39:53.891,You better back him down!
00:39:58.771,00:40:00.230,Fuck this.
00:40:01.273,00:40:03.943,I'm gonna go clear houses with Marines.
00:40:04.276,00:40:05.695,You comin'?
00:40:05.778,00:40:07.447,"Fuck, no, I'm not coming."
00:40:07.947,00:40:09.490,"No, man, I like my life."
00:40:09.574,00:40:11.659,I'd actually like to make it home alive.
00:40:11.742,00:40:14.328,"Look, it's not my job to go fucking knocking down doors, all right?"
00:40:14.412,00:40:15.705,Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.
00:40:15.788,00:40:17.081,I'm not doing that shit.
00:40:17.164,00:40:21.877,"All right. Well, if I don't see you down there, you make sure I don't see you again."
00:40:28.342,00:40:31.011,Hey. You all mind if I roll with you?
00:40:31.095,00:40:33.263,"Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me."
00:40:34.765,00:40:36.183,"You're that guy, the one they're calling The Legend."
00:40:36.266,00:40:37.643,"You've got, like, 24 confirmed kills."
00:40:37.727,00:40:39.103,"Well, who's counting?"
00:40:39.186,00:40:40.688,That's fucking badass.
00:40:40.771,00:40:43.232,"Yeah, I heard some motherfucker in Bravo's catching up, yo."
00:40:43.315,00:40:47.236,"Listen, I know y'all are meat-eaters for sure, but I know a couple things, some simple shit I could show you."
00:40:47.319,00:40:48.779,Maybe keep us above ground. What do you say?
00:40:49.780,00:40:51.281,-All right. -Right on.
00:40:56.286,00:40:58.372,"-Hey, what's that mean, bro? -Breacher up."
00:41:04.462,00:41:05.463,CHRIS: Moving.
00:41:05.546,00:41:07.507,Get down! Get down on the ground right now!
00:41:09.008,00:41:10.092,"No, no, no."
00:41:10.175,00:41:12.136,-He no understand! -GILLESPIE: Get down!
00:41:12.219,00:41:13.471,Why are you here?
00:41:13.554,00:41:14.930,You're supposed to be evacuating this area.
00:41:15.014,00:41:16.223,Why are you still here?
00:41:16.306,00:41:17.475,I am Sheikh Al-Obodi!
00:41:17.558,00:41:19.393,Sheikh Al-Who? Who the fuck are you?
00:41:19.477,00:41:20.728,This my home! I stay!
00:41:20.811,00:41:22.229,CHRIS: I don't give a fuck it's your home!
00:41:22.312,00:41:24.231,"-This is a war zone, sir! -Sir, please!"
00:41:24.314,00:41:25.483,CHRIS: Get that kid down!
00:41:25.566,00:41:27.401,-No! No! -MARINE: Come on. Move it.
00:41:27.485,00:41:28.569,"You, sir, let me help you."
00:41:28.653,00:41:29.945,Found these bitches in the back closet.
00:41:30.029,00:41:31.906,You are welcome! You are my guest!
00:41:31.989,00:41:33.157,How many more do you have here?
00:41:33.240,00:41:34.909,Tell the soldiers to come in.
00:41:34.992,00:41:37.745,This Haji just wants us all in here so he can blow us up.
00:41:37.828,00:41:41.331,"-Go check his ass for a vest. -If he see American, -he know we speak. Please. -CHRIS: Who?"
00:41:41.415,00:41:43.417,Who? Who? Who says talk to us?
00:41:43.501,00:41:45.127,-SHEIKH: Please come in. -Who knows we're talking?
00:41:47.672,00:41:49.089,He... He come.
00:41:52.467,00:41:54.219,He very bad. Please.
00:41:54.303,00:41:55.805,-Is the target secure? -GILLESPIE: Target's secure.
00:41:55.888,00:41:57.264,Bring 'em in. Get your head down on the ground.
00:41:57.347,00:41:58.516,Put your hands behind your back.
00:41:59.600,00:42:00.768,Now! Move now!
00:42:00.851,00:42:01.936,"Please, please."
00:42:02.019,00:42:03.478,"CHRIS: You gonna talk, we'll talk to you."
00:42:06.857,00:42:08.693,CHRIS: Bring him in the other room.
00:42:15.365,00:42:19.620,"If he talks to U.S. soldiers, they will come to his house -and make examples of them. -He? Who's he? Who's he?"
00:42:24.249,00:42:25.543,The man who comes they call The Butcher.
00:42:25.626,00:42:26.836,He's the despaired one.
00:42:26.919,00:42:28.879,"Son of Shaytan, son of Devil."
00:42:28.963,00:42:30.339,"Oh, he's like an enforcer?"
00:42:32.717,00:42:34.719,"-Yes, enforcer. -Number-one soldier Zarqawi."
00:42:34.802,00:42:36.220,-Zarqawi? -Zarqawi.
00:42:36.303,00:42:37.763,"Yeah, we'd like to know where Zarqawi is."
00:42:37.847,00:42:38.806,Do you know where he is?
00:42:38.889,00:42:40.057,You tell us where he is right now.
00:42:42.392,00:42:48.649,"You have information for us about Zarqawi, You find The Butcher, you find Zarqawi. He reports to him."
00:42:48.733,00:42:50.150,"Okay, well, how do we find him?"
00:42:52.778,00:42:54.154,"All right, look at me when I'm talking to you."
00:42:54.238,00:42:55.656,Where do we find him?
00:42:58.075,00:43:00.828,"We must understand the risk to them, but he will ask for money."
00:43:03.831,00:43:05.332,"$100,000."
00:43:05.415,00:43:06.876,"You need $100,000?"
00:43:06.959,00:43:08.543,I have no proof this guy exists.
00:43:10.796,00:43:12.214,Fatima!
00:43:18.638,00:43:19.764,Hello.
00:43:25.477,00:43:27.062,This is the proof.
00:43:27.146,00:43:28.438,"All right, look, I wanna help you out. I do."
00:43:28.522,00:43:29.607,But I need something.
00:43:29.690,00:43:31.400,"I need phone numbers, address, names."
00:43:31.483,00:43:32.652,You have to give me something.
00:43:34.278,00:43:36.280,Sir! First platoon's pinned down.
00:43:36.697,00:43:37.782,Let's move out!
00:43:37.865,00:43:39.033,"Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you."
00:43:41.160,00:43:43.453,"I need something. I can help you out, Sheikh."
00:43:43.954,00:43:46.081,"You give me a name, and we will take care of it."
00:43:46.165,00:43:48.167,I can promise you that. We will give you safety.
00:43:52.462,00:43:54.089,-Emile Anafanoos? -Amir Khalaf Fanus.
00:43:54.173,00:43:56.050,This is given name of The Butcher.
00:43:56.842,00:43:59.637,We believe that The Butcher is Zarqawi's number-two man.
00:44:00.137,00:44:01.596,This is your guy right here.
00:44:01.681,00:44:02.932,"Yeah, but you don't know his real name."
00:44:03.015,00:44:05.350,"Otherwise, you would have written it up there."
00:44:06.018,00:44:07.687,We got several aliases.
00:44:08.813,00:44:13.525,"Now, if Fanus is legit, we'll, uh... We'll go see the Sheikh."
00:44:13.984,00:44:15.444,"He's asking for $100,000."
00:44:15.527,00:44:16.570,Figures.
00:44:16.654,00:44:19.156,"If he delivers The Butcher, he's gonna get it."
00:44:19.239,00:44:20.991,"This is Agent Snead, DIA."
00:44:21.075,00:44:24.328,I need a name check on a Amir Khalaf Fanus.
00:44:26.831,00:44:29.416,"I mean, if we're gonna go back out there, Team 3 can pull security."
00:44:29.499,00:44:32.670,That's not gonna happen. Head-shed's gonna want contractors on it if we're humpin' money.
00:44:33.503,00:44:35.715,"Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?"
00:44:39.051,00:44:40.720,All right. Okay.
00:44:43.055,00:44:45.099,Let's go see the Sheikh.
00:45:01.531,00:45:02.867,Road kill.
00:45:03.242,00:45:05.995,You know The Butcher is Zarqawi's enforcer?
00:45:06.078,00:45:09.206,They say his weapon of choice is a fuckin' drill.
00:45:09.874,00:45:13.043,Went to seminary school before I joined the Navy.
00:45:14.086,00:45:16.130,Was close to being a preacher.
00:45:16.213,00:45:17.882,And why didn't you?
00:45:19.424,00:45:23.053,"I love to gamble, man. Love those dice."
00:45:24.554,00:45:25.722,That's my kind of preacher.
00:45:41.571,00:45:43.323,"It's like that now, huh?"
00:45:43.407,00:45:46.160,"Oh, haven't you heard? I'm The Legend."
00:45:46.911,00:45:47.953,"Hey, babe."
00:45:48.328,00:45:50.747,You were right. The doctor says it's a boy.
00:45:51.290,00:45:52.541,What?
00:45:55.920,00:45:57.337,It's a boy?
00:45:58.505,00:45:59.840,"Hell, yeah, man."
00:45:59.924,00:46:01.091,Congratulations!
00:46:16.440,00:46:17.482,Chris?
00:46:17.942,00:46:19.902,Grab the money! Get to the truck!
00:46:28.452,00:46:30.787,SOLDIER: Let's go! Let's go! Grab the bag! Grab the bag!
00:46:34.041,00:46:35.042,Chris.
00:46:40.380,00:46:41.882,SNEAD: Go! Go! Get the fuck outta here.
00:46:41.966,00:46:43.050,We'll come back for them.
00:46:46.678,00:46:47.847,Baby?
00:46:48.138,00:46:49.806,-I heard one shot. -Check.
00:46:50.057,00:46:51.725,Came in at an angle.
00:46:52.184,00:46:53.643,Be 300 or more yards out.
00:46:53.894,00:46:55.062,"Oh, my God."
00:46:58.858,00:47:00.109,You got a bead on him?
00:47:00.192,00:47:01.651,I got a Tang in the window.
00:47:04.989,00:47:06.073,I got eyes on The Butcher.
00:47:06.156,00:47:08.367,He's got the Sheikh's kid on the avenue.
00:47:15.499,00:47:16.917,Requesting QRF.
00:47:17.001,00:47:20.587,We're being pinned down by sniper fire on approach of high-value target.
00:47:20.670,00:47:23.423,Grid 0-4-5-3-6-2-3-6.
00:47:23.507,00:47:24.508,Over.
00:47:24.591,00:47:26.343,I wanna pop a smoke 'em and secure this building.
00:47:26.426,00:47:27.511,I'm going to the roof.
00:47:31.806,00:47:32.807,Hold up!
00:47:38.939,00:47:40.024,Hold.
00:47:40.274,00:47:41.316,Hold it.
00:47:43.110,00:47:44.278,Go!
00:49:40.685,00:49:43.272,"Come on, you fuckin' son of a bitch!"
00:49:43.813,00:49:44.981,Fuck you!
00:49:55.659,00:49:57.869,"GRONSKI: Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess."
00:49:58.495,00:50:00.414,"You are one dumb son of a bitch, you know that?"
00:50:00.497,00:50:01.998,What the hell were you thinking?
00:50:02.082,00:50:05.169,You completely failed to secure the battlefield.
00:50:05.252,00:50:08.088,"I'm shuttin' this whole thing down, pending an inquiry. Get back to base!"
00:50:08.172,00:50:09.964,"Hey, we gotta set up a squad and pursue him."
00:50:10.049,00:50:12.176,"Nope, they're shuttin' us down."
00:50:12.259,00:50:13.593,What do you mean?
00:50:13.677,00:50:15.804,Can't leave the wire till they figure this shit out.
00:50:15.887,00:50:17.764,"Well, he can't just leave us like that."
00:50:17.847,00:50:20.434,Hey! I go home in three weeks!
00:50:22.102,00:50:24.146,"Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks."
00:51:12.527,00:51:13.987,-Hey. -Oh!
00:51:17.574,00:51:19.075,"CHRIS: Hey, baby."
00:51:20.785,00:51:21.828,TAYA: I thought you were dead.
00:51:21.911,00:51:22.996,CHRIS: Yeah.
00:51:23.079,00:51:24.248,I'm sorry.
00:51:24.581,00:51:25.582,I'm sorry.
00:51:25.665,00:51:26.708,"No, I thought you'd be okay."
00:51:26.791,00:51:28.210,"Well, I'm right here."
00:51:38.137,00:51:39.721,-You all right? -Yeah.
00:51:59.699,00:52:01.493,You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
00:52:02.952,00:52:05.455,I have an alien growing inside me.
00:52:07.332,00:52:09.751,And there's a strange man in my bedroom.
00:52:09.834,00:52:11.628,"Oh, it's our bedroom."
00:52:15.965,00:52:17.634,Your hands feel different.
00:52:26.810,00:52:28.395,"-Well, I am, too. -No, you're not."
00:52:28.478,00:52:30.230,"-Yes, I am. I swear. -You're lying."
00:52:30.314,00:52:33.608,How do I know some alien in there is not gonna come out and grab me...
00:52:35.819,00:52:40.156,Then I'm gonna have to choke him out.
00:52:44.661,00:52:46.621,-It's gonna be okay. -Promise?
00:52:46.705,00:52:48.290,"Yeah, of course."
00:52:50.834,00:52:52.794,Why are you so good with me?
00:53:01.010,00:53:03.430,"TAYA: Hey, babe. It might be nice to get out."
00:53:07.016,00:53:08.685,-Chris. -Huh?
00:53:10.186,00:53:11.813,"What do you wanna do today, hon?"
00:53:16.150,00:53:18.487,I thought we could just relax here.
00:53:21.573,00:53:23.367,"Okay, we do that."
00:53:25.327,00:53:26.995,Let's relax.
00:53:28.037,00:53:29.414,CHRIS: What're you doin'?
00:53:29.498,00:53:31.124,TAYA: Putting my foot on you.
00:53:31.207,00:53:33.418,"Well, you know that's the way to my heart."
00:53:36.296,00:53:37.964,I'm comin' over.
00:53:47.307,00:53:49.309,"-DOCTOR: And that looks great. -TAYA: Oh, look."
00:53:49.393,00:53:50.602,Look. He's touching his nose.
00:53:51.895,00:53:53.647,-How are you feeling? -TAYA: I'm all right.
00:53:53.730,00:53:55.106,I just want him out. I'm tired.
00:53:55.189,00:53:56.400,"Well, it's gonna be any day now."
00:53:56.483,00:53:57.776,TAYA: I hope so.
00:53:57.859,00:53:59.986,"How 'bout you, Mr. Kyle? How're you feelin'?"
00:54:00.069,00:54:01.738,"I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am."
00:54:01.821,00:54:04.240,I imagine it's hard to decompress.
00:54:05.575,00:54:07.160,Not really. No.
00:54:07.243,00:54:09.913,This is the first time we've left the house.
00:54:10.038,00:54:12.081,I'm happy to be home. Yeah.
00:54:14.751,00:54:17.253,"Here, slip this on for me, would you?"
00:54:18.422,00:54:22.008,"Uh, I think if you wanna check anything out, you may wanna check out these knees. I don't know what I did..."
00:54:22.091,00:54:23.468,"-Are you a smoker? -No, ma'am."
00:54:23.552,00:54:24.678,You drink?
00:54:24.761,00:54:26.179,Only when I'm thirsty.
00:54:35.271,00:54:37.065,"Jesus Christ, Chris."
00:54:37.691,00:54:38.858,Is that high?
00:54:38.942,00:54:40.694,Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.
00:54:40.777,00:54:42.529,But for someone who is sitting down... Yeah.
00:54:42.612,00:54:44.781,"Oh, I appreciate you, uh, takin' a look at that."
00:54:44.864,00:54:47.116,I'll look into it. Thank you.
00:54:47.200,00:54:48.952,Will you look into it?
00:54:49.077,00:54:50.119,Yeah.
00:54:52.664,00:54:53.873,"Oh, you sabotaged me back there."
00:54:53.957,00:54:55.750,What am I supposed to do? You're not talking.
00:54:55.834,00:54:57.043,You act like it's all okay.
00:54:57.126,00:54:58.378,It is okay. I'm fine.
00:54:58.462,00:54:59.796,"You're not fine, Chris, all right?"
00:54:59.879,00:55:02.882,"Your blood pressure is, like, fuckin' 170/110."
00:55:02.966,00:55:05.344,"Babe, I'm drivin' down the freeway."
00:55:05.427,00:55:07.721,It's sunny. It's 72 degrees. I'm fine.
00:55:07.804,00:55:09.639,There's a war goin' on. There's people dyin'.
00:55:09.723,00:55:10.807,No one's even talkin' about that.
00:55:10.890,00:55:11.891,It's like it's not even happenin'.
00:55:13.893,00:55:16.062,"livin' our simple, simplistic lives."
00:55:16.145,00:55:17.689,-It's not even on the news. -Chris.
00:55:17.772,00:55:18.898,No one cares.
00:55:18.982,00:55:20.817,"There's a war goin' on, and I'm headed to the mall."
00:55:20.900,00:55:21.985,-Chris. -I'm not supposed to be here.
00:55:22.068,00:55:23.528,-I'm supposed to be over... -It's happening.
00:55:23.612,00:55:25.489,-What's wrong? You okay? -It's happening.
00:55:25.822,00:55:27.616,Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back.
00:55:31.661,00:55:32.954,You're fucking crazy! You know that?
00:55:33.037,00:55:34.163,It's okay. Hey! Hey! Baby.
00:55:34.247,00:55:35.331,Oh.

00:55:52.348,00:55:53.600,"Hey, pal."
00:55:53.683,00:55:55.351,-Hey. -Baby.
00:55:55.435,00:55:56.770,"Hey, little guy."
00:55:59.439,00:56:01.107,"Hey, little guy."
00:56:03.443,00:56:05.820,Look what we did. Look what we made.

01:29:10.428,01:29:14.181,"We were operating out of emotion, and we just walked right into an ambush."
01:29:15.016,01:29:17.184,But that's not what killed him.
01:29:18.561,01:29:20.938,That letter did. That letter killed Marc.
01:29:21.022,01:29:25.151,"He just... He let go, and he paid the price for it."
01:29:36.328,01:29:37.539,Sign in here?
01:29:48.758,01:29:50.051,"Hey, buddy."
01:29:50.760,01:29:52.344,"-Hey, Chris? -Yeah."
01:29:52.429,01:29:54.639,"-Where you at, man? -I'm right here. I'm right here."
01:29:54.889,01:29:56.307,"Oh, shit, you're blind as a bat."
01:29:58.893,01:30:00.728,"They say they're gonna fix my face, though."
01:30:02.605,01:30:04.441,About time. Your face needs some fixing.
01:30:06.067,01:30:08.360,-It is too soon? -Way too soon.
01:30:08.570,01:30:10.321,"Hey, I heard you proposed."
01:30:10.530,01:30:12.490,"-Yeah. -Well, good for you."
01:30:12.574,01:30:13.575,Mmm.
01:30:13.658,01:30:15.284,"You didn't tell her you bought that diamond, uh..."
01:30:15.367,01:30:16.869,"You told her you bought it at Zales, right?"
01:30:16.953,01:30:18.162,-No. -You didn't?
01:30:20.748,01:30:21.874,It's a smaller one.
01:30:21.958,01:30:23.292,Her dad helped me out with it.
01:30:23.375,01:30:24.544,"-Oh, nice. -Yeah."
01:30:24.627,01:30:26.128,"-Oh, good. -Mmm-hmm."
01:30:26.546,01:30:28.297,"She wouldn't leave me, bro."
01:30:30.592,01:30:32.885,"I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave."
01:30:34.428,01:30:36.430,She's getting a raw fucking deal.
01:30:37.431,01:30:39.100,Why would you say that?
01:30:39.433,01:30:41.310,Don't say that. She's got you.
01:30:45.607,01:30:46.899,Two inches.
01:30:48.275,01:30:51.445,"Yeah, you know, I'm glad this happened to me and not you."
01:30:52.071,01:30:53.656,Ain't no way you could have handled it.
01:30:53.740,01:30:54.866,"Yeah, you're probably right."
01:30:56.242,01:30:59.537,So they say you're the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history.
01:30:59.621,01:31:00.913,"Oh, is that right?"
01:31:00.997,01:31:02.206,That's what I heard.
01:31:04.416,01:31:06.628,The bad guys ended up in Sadr City.
01:31:06.961,01:31:08.004,You're not going back?
01:31:08.087,01:31:10.882,"Yeah, we are. We're gonna wall 'em in -and hunt 'em down. -Nah, come on, man."
01:31:10.965,01:31:12.174,You don't have to do that.
01:31:12.258,01:31:13.551,"Oh, we have to do that."
01:31:13.635,01:31:17.680,"You're my brother, and they're gonna fucking pay for what they did to you."
01:31:19.641,01:31:21.142,"Hooyah, Legend."
01:31:22.184,01:31:23.686,Fuckin' hooyah.
01:31:29.817,01:31:33.821,"Something happens to me, you'd be all right."
01:31:34.531,01:31:36.490,You'd find someone else.
01:31:39.451,01:31:41.078,Do you wanna die?
01:31:42.163,01:31:43.831,Is that what it is?
01:31:44.165,01:31:45.332,No.
01:31:46.333,01:31:48.002,Then just tell me.
01:31:49.336,01:31:50.755,Tell me why you do it.
01:31:50.838,01:31:52.423,"-Oh, come on. -I wanna understand."
01:31:52.506,01:31:54.091,"Babe, I do it for you. You know that."
01:31:54.175,01:31:55.635,"-I do it to protect you. -No, you don't."
01:31:55.718,01:31:56.969,"Yes, I do."
01:31:57.219,01:32:00.139,I'm here. Your family is here.
01:32:00.222,01:32:01.641,Your children have no father.
01:32:01.724,01:32:03.475,I have to serve my country.
01:32:03.560,01:32:04.936,Such fucking bullshit!
01:32:05.019,01:32:06.312,"No, it's not."
01:32:06.563,01:32:08.189,You don't know when to quit.
01:32:09.649,01:32:11.818,You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.
01:32:11.901,01:32:13.444,You let somebody else go.
01:32:13.527,01:32:15.279,-Let somebody else go? -Yeah.
01:32:15.362,01:32:16.656,"Babe, I couldn't live with myself."
01:32:16.739,01:32:18.199,"Yeah, well, you find a way."
01:32:18.700,01:32:19.867,You have to.
01:32:25.164,01:32:28.668,"Okay, I need you to be human again."
01:32:31.295,01:32:32.546,I need you here.
01:32:40.096,01:32:46.185,"If you leave again, I don't think we'll be here when you get back."
01:32:52.066,01:32:53.150,Come here.
01:33:12.544,01:33:13.713,"Hey, Chris."
01:33:15.422,01:33:18.217,"We've been shot off position three nights in a row, man."
01:33:18.300,01:33:20.594,Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.
01:33:21.095,01:33:22.388,"This city's fucking biblical, Chris."
01:33:22.471,01:33:24.223,Is there any other Punishers here?
01:33:24.306,01:33:25.850,"Well, Squirrel cycled out."
01:33:26.433,01:33:28.686,"And Dauber was coming back, but his wife knocked him up."
01:33:28.770,01:33:32.273,"And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll murder my motherfuckin' ass, Chris."
01:33:32.356,01:33:34.483,"-Teams and shit, right? -Teams and shit."
01:33:34.566,01:33:36.277,"Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man."
01:33:36.360,01:33:38.237,"Oh, man, I went to see him in the hospital before I left."
01:33:38.320,01:33:40.031,Motherfucker can't see shit.
01:33:41.115,01:33:42.491,"Biggles is gone, Chris."
01:33:43.951,01:33:47.413,"He was in surgery yesterday and, um, he died on that table."
01:33:55.880,01:33:56.881,"VOICEMAIL: Hey, this is Taya."
01:33:56.964,01:33:59.383,"I can't get to the phone, so please leave a message."
01:34:00.718,01:34:02.428,Just calling to hear your voice.
01:34:03.137,01:34:04.722,"Listen, you guys."
01:34:04.806,01:34:07.308,I'm thinking about some things you said.
01:34:08.142,01:34:09.811,Tell the kids I love 'em.
01:34:10.394,01:34:11.645,"I love you, too."
01:35:19.380,01:35:20.631,Don't pick it up.
01:35:24.886,01:35:26.720,Don't you fuckin' pick it up.
01:35:32.351,01:35:33.770,Son of a bitch.
01:35:37.731,01:35:39.275,Fuckin' drop it.
01:35:52.579,01:35:53.915,"Drop it, you little..."
01:36:23.194,01:36:24.278,"MARTIN: All right, listen up."
01:36:24.361,01:36:29.533,The head-shed believe this T-wall here will help win the war by trapping remaining AQI behind it.
01:36:29.741,01:36:35.706,"Problem is, the engineers building the goddamn thing are getting picked off by one single sniper -from deep behind the wall. -How deep?"
01:36:36.833,01:36:37.875,"Roughly 1,000 meters."
01:36:38.125,01:36:39.710,-Is it Mustafa? -Mu-who?
01:36:40.002,01:36:43.214,"-I don't know, dude. -The sniper who killed our fucking friend, Biggles, man."
01:36:43.297,01:36:44.966,He can be whoever the fuck you need him to be.
01:36:45.049,01:36:46.383,We just need him dead.
01:36:46.467,01:36:51.889,"We'll shuttle you six blocks north into enemy territory, which will put you right up under the sniper's nose when he takes his shot. Okay?"
01:36:51.973,01:36:53.349,In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?
01:36:53.432,01:36:55.226,"Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi."
01:36:55.309,01:36:57.394,We need to shut this shooter down.
01:36:57.478,01:36:59.396,Understood? Gear up.
01:36:59.480,01:37:00.689,"ALL: Yes, sir."
01:38:24.773,01:38:26.483,SOLDIER: Clear. Move out!
01:39:07.984,01:39:09.026,CHRIS: It's clear.
01:39:09.276,01:39:10.694,-We're maneuver. You're base. -Yeah.

01:39:21.955,01:39:23.165,Go! Go!
01:39:25.459,01:39:26.710,All clear.
01:39:26.960,01:39:28.212,Set security.
01:40:08.001,01:40:10.171,The streets are crawling. Hold your fire.
01:40:20.347,01:40:22.433,Enter the fuckin' sandman.
01:41:02.723,01:41:03.890,SOLDIER 1: Stay down! SOLDIER 2: Sniper!
01:41:07.603,01:41:08.729,Shit!
01:41:09.271,01:41:11.273,Shot came from the east.
01:41:17.238,01:41:19.906,We set up in the wrong fuckin' direction.
01:41:21.408,01:41:23.327,Doesn't matter. Hold your fire.
01:41:23.410,01:41:24.661,We got uglies right below us.
01:41:58.111,01:42:00.572,"I got somethin' 1,900 yards out."
01:42:00.781,01:42:02.741,"Fuck, you can't even see that far out."
01:42:02.824,01:42:04.951,Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.
01:42:05.118,01:42:07.120,"He's right, Legend. No bueno."
01:42:07.538,01:42:09.873,"Correction. It's 2,100 yards out."
01:42:11.833,01:42:14.336,"That's more than a mile. Impossible shot, Chris."
01:42:26.807,01:42:27.974,It's him.
01:42:30.143,01:42:31.395,This is Task Unit Bruiser.
01:42:31.478,01:42:33.814,I got eyes on target. Initiate QRF. Over.
01:42:34.356,01:42:37.568,FOB SOLDIER: Copy that. ET on Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out.
01:42:53.166,01:42:54.626,He has eyes on our guys.
01:42:54.835,01:42:56.253,Can you confirm it's him?
01:42:59.089,01:43:00.382,It's him.
01:43:01.550,01:43:02.759,"Oh, it's him."
01:43:02.843,01:43:04.052,"It's your call, Chris."
01:43:04.761,01:43:06.096,Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out.
01:43:06.179,01:43:07.848,You'll stand the fuck down!
01:43:21.612,01:43:23.029,"If you got it, take it, man."
01:43:25.907,01:43:27.743,"Aim small, miss small."
01:43:29.202,01:43:30.787,Do it for Biggles.
01:44:04.988,01:44:06.407,"You just fucked us, Legend."
01:44:09.576,01:44:10.577,Tango down.
01:44:10.952,01:44:12.496,We need QRF ASAP!
01:44:17.293,01:44:18.919,Mission accomplished.
01:44:19.503,01:44:21.212,He had eyes on our guys.
01:44:21.672,01:44:23.382,-And I took him out. -Yeah.
01:44:23.465,01:44:26.009,Now we're fucked like a football bat!
01:44:28.637,01:44:29.930,Biggles would be proud.
01:44:32.391,01:44:33.600,"You did it, Chris."
01:44:36.603,01:44:40.023,"FOB SOLDIER: Echo 7 Kilo, be advised you have enemy approaching all directions of your pos."
01:44:40.106,01:44:42.943,"White-side! God damn it, Legend. Fuck!"

01:44:51.452,01:44:53.036,"All right, I see two ways up onto the roof."
01:44:53.119,01:44:54.621,We wanna lock both staircases.
01:44:54.955,01:44:56.039,Conserve ammo.
01:45:27.070,01:45:28.905,"Get some, motherfuckers!"
01:45:55.682,01:45:58.894,"FOB SOLDIER: Echo 7 Kilo, you have Tango-heavy gun on your green-side."

01:50:48.725,01:50:50.560,"He was just behind me. Where is Chris, man?"
01:50:53.188,01:50:54.314,Open the fuckin' door!
01:50:59.152,01:51:00.320,Stop the goddamn rig!

01:51:56.042,01:52:00.546,"penetration, draw defenders, and then leave it for Balkman in perfect scoring position."
01:52:05.718,01:52:08.388,ANNOUNCER 2: The first player with three.
01:52:08.889,01:52:11.557,"Renaldo Balkman, that big smile, so engaging."
01:52:11.682,01:52:12.934,He's a big fan favorite.
01:52:13.059,01:52:18.189,He's got the Balkman Buddies in their T-shirts behind us cheering his every move.
01:52:33.746,01:52:34.790,Yeah?
01:52:34.915,01:52:35.957,"TAYA: Hey, it's me."
01:52:36.249,01:52:39.210,I just got this weird message that you were on a plane or something?
01:52:39.294,01:52:42.047,"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got out early."
01:52:44.632,01:52:46.592,"So, what, are you in Germany, or... Where?"
01:52:51.306,01:52:52.598,I'm stateside.
01:52:53.892,01:52:55.393,You're home?
01:52:56.436,01:52:58.646,What... What are you doin'?
01:53:03.109,01:53:05.403,I guess I just needed a minute.
01:53:07.989,01:53:11.034,"Chris, the... The kids are dyin' to see you."
01:53:11.117,01:53:13.078,It's been nine months. What...
01:53:23.421,01:53:25.090,Are you all right?
01:53:31.137,01:53:33.139,"Babe, come home. Okay?"
01:53:39.770,01:53:41.189,Okay.
01:54:21.729,01:54:22.855,"TAYA: Hey, Chris?"
01:54:23.856,01:54:25.066,Babe.
01:54:32.240,01:54:34.409,"Hon, I'm going outside."
01:54:43.459,01:54:44.460,GIRL: Higher.
01:54:45.378,01:54:47.755,"Look at you. I can see your face again, babe."
01:54:49.382,01:54:51.426,"-Oh, good. -Looks different."
01:54:52.843,01:54:55.013,So the game's this Saturday.
01:54:55.096,01:54:56.932,"You know, he's the tallest kid on the team."
01:54:57.057,01:54:59.017,Doctor said he could be 6'4.
01:54:59.100,01:55:00.685,-Isn't that insane? -Mmm.
01:55:02.062,01:55:03.146,I can't wait for you to see him play.
01:55:03.229,01:55:05.023,"I go so crazy, though, when the other kids jump on him."
01:55:05.106,01:55:11.237,"Like, I need you there as, like, a leveler, Hey, maybe you could even coach, you know?"
01:55:14.532,01:55:18.828,"Kenna's gonna lose that tooth, and I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it, like, in her sleep or something."
01:55:18.912,01:55:21.456,"And she said she'd let you pull it, but only you."
01:55:21.581,01:55:23.208,Would you do that?
01:55:41.101,01:55:42.102,Chris!
01:55:56.950,01:55:58.659,DOCTOR: I got a very interesting phone call.
01:55:58.784,01:55:59.953,It's from your wife.
01:56:00.745,01:56:02.330,She told me about the barbecue.
01:56:06.126,01:56:07.668,Things seem like they got a little out of hand.
01:56:08.294,01:56:09.504,Are you worried?
01:56:09.629,01:56:11.006,"Uh, no, sir."
01:56:11.131,01:56:14.259,"So you're not worried about what happened, or what might happen?"
01:56:14.675,01:56:16.469,"No, sir, I'm not worried about that."
01:56:18.346,01:56:20.556,"Let me ask you a question, Chris."
01:56:20.640,01:56:22.892,How much time did you spend in-country?
01:56:22.976,01:56:25.436,"Uh, well, four tours, so, uh..."
01:56:25.936,01:56:27.813,"That's like, what, 1,000 days?"
01:56:27.938,01:56:29.940,"Yeah, sounds about right."
01:56:30.525,01:56:36.114,Would you be surprised if I told you that the Navy has credited you with over 160 kills?
01:56:36.197,01:56:37.365,Mmm.
01:56:38.366,01:56:44.830,Do you ever think that you might have seen things or done some things over there that you wish you hadn't?
01:56:45.290,01:56:47.167,"Oh, that's not me. No."
01:56:48.376,01:56:49.544,What's not you?
01:56:49.669,01:56:50.753,I was just protecting my guys.
01:56:50.836,01:56:57.677,"They were trying to kill our soldiers and, uh, I'm willing to meet my Creator and answer for every shot that I took."
01:57:00.388,01:57:06.519,"The thing that, uh, haunts me are all the guys that I couldn't save."
01:57:07.728,01:57:12.108,"You know, I'm willing and able to be there, but I'm not. I'm here. I quit."
01:57:14.194,01:57:15.736,So you wish you could've saved more guys?
01:57:17.530,01:57:18.739,"Yes, sir."
01:57:20.658,01:57:23.703,You can walk down any hall in this hospital.
01:57:24.245,01:57:26.372,We got plenty of soldiers need saving.
01:57:30.085,01:57:31.377,Mmm-hmm.
01:57:32.337,01:57:34.004,Wanna take a walk?
01:57:34.214,01:57:35.423,Sure.
01:57:36.216,01:57:39.094,All right. I wanna show you something.
01:57:42.388,01:57:47.643,"I still smoke, but can't be too mad at it 'cause it kinda saved my right hand."
01:57:47.727,01:57:49.062,CHRIS: How so?
01:57:49.395,01:57:53.733,"When I got blown up, I had both of my hands on the bottom of the steering wheel."
01:57:53.858,01:57:59.447,"And right before the explosion went off, I took my hand off, grabbed a cigarette, stuck it in my mouth."
01:57:59.572,01:58:02.908,"And when I went to go light it, the explosion happened."
01:58:03.033,01:58:06.787,And it took the whole bottom of the steering wheel and my left hand off.
01:58:06.912,01:58:08.831,And I was lucky that I had this.
01:58:08.914,01:58:11.751,"I mean, it still fucked up my right hand, but..."
01:58:12.085,01:58:13.461,CHRIS: Yeah. VETERAN: I still got it.
01:58:13.586,01:58:14.754,CHRIS: And you still smoke?
01:58:23.763,01:58:25.473,Miss. Three inches to the right.
01:58:25.598,01:58:28.268,"Come on, Wynn. You can do better than that."
01:58:29.394,01:58:31.437,CHRIS: Bring this to the right.
01:58:32.062,01:58:33.773,Make sure you keep both eyes open.
01:58:33.939,01:58:35.566,Let that trigger surprise you.
01:58:35.650,01:58:38.111,"We're not shootin' bad guys, we're shootin' paper."
01:58:38.236,01:58:40.155,How about The Legend stops trying to fuck up my shot?
01:58:40.238,01:58:41.447,-How about that? -CHRIS: How about you hit one?
01:58:43.783,01:58:44.825,-Hit! -CHRIS: There you go.
01:58:44.950,01:58:46.661,"Bull's-eye, boy."
01:58:46.786,01:58:49.997,"Damn, if that don't feel like I got my balls back."
01:58:51.624,01:58:53.834,"Why you spendin' all this time with us, man?"
01:58:53.959,01:58:55.628,I know you got a family.
01:58:55.753,01:58:58.214,I heard you had a boot collection before the war?
01:58:58.298,01:59:00.425,"So I was thinking, I saw we were about the same size."
01:59:01.342,01:59:03.219,"Seriously, man."
01:59:03.303,01:59:04.512,Why do you do it?
01:59:04.762,01:59:07.307,"Well, we take care of each other, right?"
01:59:07.432,01:59:09.934,Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.
01:59:11.269,01:59:12.812,"Come on, man. You got this."
01:59:15.273,01:59:16.691,Nice.
01:59:21.987,01:59:23.281,God damn.
01:59:24.490,01:59:25.616,Who's the legend now?
01:59:27.493,01:59:28.953,That's a title you don't want.
01:59:29.370,01:59:30.413,Trust me.
01:59:36.001,01:59:37.670,"CHRIS: Yo, will you hop down? I'll give 'em to you."
01:59:44.510,01:59:45.761,"All right, take 'em inside."
02:00:14.749,02:00:16.542,"It's not a bad life out here, is it?"
02:00:17.084,02:00:19.044,Got a smile on his face.
02:00:19.504,02:00:20.671,Looks cheery to me.
02:00:22.047,02:00:23.924,Just doing his thing.
02:00:26.594,02:00:28.429,Wave goodbye to him.
02:00:37.688,02:00:39.982,"CHRIS: Oh, fuck, who is that?"
02:00:40.065,02:00:41.609,"Oh, babe, is that you?"
02:00:43.236,02:00:45.363,-I fucking hurt myself. Shit. -What?
02:00:45.446,02:00:47.615,"No, I'm all right. I'm all right!"
02:00:47.698,02:00:49.158,I'm all right. Fuck.
02:00:49.242,02:00:50.618,"-Baby, I'm sorry. -It's okay."
02:00:50.701,02:00:52.328,What happened? Don't you!
02:00:55.581,02:00:58.959,CHRIS: You know that it's a heck of thing to stop a beatin' heart.
02:00:59.585,02:01:00.670,COLTON: Yeah.
02:01:00.753,02:01:03.881,CHRIS: That's why we're gonna do it together for your first time.
02:01:06.216,02:01:12.723,"Now remember, you gotta be calm, confident, and you never hesitate."
02:01:13.891,02:01:14.934,All right.
02:01:15.059,02:01:17.102,"-You got it, bubba? -I got it."
02:01:17.227,02:01:18.979,-You feel good? -Yeah.
02:01:35.580,02:01:36.956,"Hands in the air, little lady."
02:01:40.918,02:01:42.462,"Now, you drop them drawers."
02:01:44.422,02:01:47.300,But you drop 'em nice and easy.
02:01:48.468,02:01:50.595,"Oh, baby, look at you."
02:01:50.678,02:01:51.846,Look at you.
02:01:54.139,02:01:55.683,Can I tell you something?
02:01:55.808,02:01:57.059,Tell it to the judge.
02:01:58.769,02:02:01.897,"No, I am so proud of you, and I don't tell you enough."
02:02:01.981,02:02:02.982,I'm so proud of you.
02:02:03.107,02:02:04.817,You're such a great father.
02:02:04.984,02:02:08.112,And I am so happy that I've got my husband back.
02:02:09.572,02:02:12.032,And I also know how hard you fought to get here.
02:02:13.784,02:02:15.786,You're worth fightin' for.
02:02:17.663,02:02:19.582,Now tell me one other thing. Did you...
02:02:19.665,02:02:21.250,-Did you pleat those jeans? -Mmm?
02:02:21.334,02:02:23.586,"Yes, ma'am. I pleated them right down the middle."
02:02:23.669,02:02:25.421,"Oh, you're just a regular, old cowboy again."
02:02:25.505,02:02:27.131,Mmm-hmm. That's right. Why don't you...
02:02:27.214,02:02:28.591,Why don't you really drop them drawers?
02:02:28.674,02:02:31.010,"I'm not wearing any drawers, baby."
02:02:31.386,02:02:33.137,I got four minutes.
02:02:35.390,02:02:36.766,"No, it takes two minutes."
02:02:36.849,02:02:39.560,But then I got... I want two minutes to look at you.
02:02:40.520,02:02:42.480,Aren't you going to the range?
02:02:43.230,02:02:44.857,Who are you taking out?
02:02:44.982,02:02:46.442,This Marine.
02:02:46.526,02:02:47.818,His mama kept asking me.
02:02:47.902,02:02:51.071,"She parks cars at the elementary school, and she said, Can you help out my son?"
02:02:51.196,02:02:54.617,"And I just thought today's the only day I can really do it, so..."
02:02:54.700,02:02:56.536,I'm... It's gonna be just a little bit of the afternoon.
02:02:59.414,02:03:00.498,You make sure you keep them drawers...
02:03:00.581,02:03:01.582,-Daddy? -What's up?
02:03:01.666,02:03:02.667,"Dad, you wanna play Skylanders?"
02:03:02.750,02:03:04.960,"Uh, no, I can't play right now."
02:03:05.044,02:03:06.253,"I'll do it when I get back, boy."
02:03:06.336,02:03:09.507,"But you got... See, you're on Level 8, and that doesn't work. I gotta be on Level 4."
02:03:09.590,02:03:10.758,And I don't want... I wanna win.
02:03:10.841,02:03:12.927,-You gotta let me win. -COLTON: No way!
02:03:13.010,02:03:14.637,-McKENNA: Poke the bear! -Poke the what?
02:03:15.846,02:03:16.972,Poke the what?
02:03:17.056,02:03:18.140,Poke the bear!
02:03:19.266,02:03:21.226,"No! You're supposed to roar, like..."
02:03:29.985,02:03:31.153,Ooh.
02:03:31.236,02:03:32.530,"All right, bubba."
02:03:32.613,02:03:34.407,"Y'all look after our women, okay?"
02:03:34.532,02:03:35.491,-Yeah. -Okay.
02:03:35.575,02:03:37.952,It's a big responsibility. You up for it?
02:03:39.912,02:03:41.497,"All right. See you later, baby."
02:03:41.581,02:03:43.916,-I love you. -I love you back.
02:03:50.214,02:03:51.841,-CHRIS: How are you? You good? -Good.
02:03:51.924,02:03:57.012,"Now, we're gonna go about a two-hour drive, and shoot some guns, and maybe have a little conversation -along the way. What you say? -Yeah."
02:03:58.097,02:03:59.807,CHRIS: All right. Let's go.
02:03:59.890,02:04:01.559,-Thank you. -Yep.
02:04:01.642,02:04:03.018,"CHRIS: Hey, you eat yet? You hungry?"
02:04:03.102,02:04:05.229,You wanna get somethin' on the way?
