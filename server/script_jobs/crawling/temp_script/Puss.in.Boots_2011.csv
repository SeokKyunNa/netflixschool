00:02:24.686,00:02:29.858,"You cannot run forever, Puss In Boots!"
00:02:37.783,00:02:39.827,I was a bad kitty.
00:02:44.081,00:02:48.710,Just a fugitive from the law...
00:02:48.752,00:02:52.422,Searching for a way to clear my name.

00:04:49.456,00:04:52.751,Perhaps you gentlemen can help me find a simple score?
00:04:52.793,00:04:57.714,"The only thing you'll find tonight is trouble, Puss In Boots."
00:05:08.642,00:05:14.940,"Well, perhaps if one of us were to tell the law that you are in town, we could split the reward."
00:05:25.408,00:05:27.077,You made the cat angry.
00:05:27.119,00:05:29.830,You do not want to make the cat angry!

00:06:01.111,00:06:03.697,Do not joke with me about magic beans!
00:06:03.738,00:06:08.367,I searched half my life for them. They do not exist.
00:06:08.409,00:06:11.663,"No, cat."

00:06:38.565,00:06:43.653,Only a cat with a death wish would steal the beans from Jack and Jill.
00:06:45.155,00:06:50.285,The only wish I have is to repay an old debt.
00:06:50.327,00:06:52.495,And this is my chance.

00:16:42.794,00:16:48.341,You have every right.
00:16:48.382,00:16:50.718,"But it is good to see you, Puss."
00:16:50.760,00:16:52.679,- Are those new boots?
00:16:52.720,00:16:57.517,No! They are the same boots I wore when you betrayed me.
00:17:00.019,00:17:05.024,"You left me cracked in pieces on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!"
00:17:05.065,00:17:08.277,And how did we get on that bridge in the first place?!
00:17:08.319,00:17:13.240,"Because we were brothers, and brothers are supposed - to look after each other...!"
00:17:14.993,00:17:17.161,Remember why we're here.
00:17:18.120,00:17:19.497,I should have known.
00:17:19.539,00:17:27.755,I had the magic beans in my grasp and you sent this very attractive devil woman to interfere.
00:17:27.797,00:17:29.674,You are a curse on my life!
00:17:29.716,00:17:31.676,"Whoa, whoa, wait."
00:17:31.718,00:17:34.345,"Yes, yes, I sent Kitty to bring you here."
00:17:34.387,00:17:36.514,But she is no ordinary thief.
00:17:38.182,00:17:42.269,She's Kitty Softpaws.
00:17:42.311,00:17:45.565,"That's a lot of heel for a guy, don't you think?"
00:17:50.028,00:17:54.114,"Look, with Kitty's skill, your sword and my brain, we've got a fighting chance here."
00:17:54.156,00:17:59.996,"Puss, come on, you of all people know that nobody's ever ripped off the giant's castle and lived to tell the tale."
00:18:00.038,00:18:03.624,You want to survive?
00:18:03.666,00:18:08.087,And I've studied this job my whole life. You know that.
00:18:08.128,00:18:13.760,"Let's... let's be honest, without me, you don't even know where to plant the beans, Puss."
00:18:13.801,00:18:16.429,But Jack and Jill do.
00:18:17.805,00:18:23.061,"We go up the beanstalk outlaws, and we come down legends."
00:18:24.979,00:18:27.189,"So, what do you say?"
00:18:27.231,00:18:28.816,Partners?
00:18:31.652,00:18:34.572,No. Never again.
00:18:36.074,00:18:37.909,"I'm sorry, OK?"
00:18:37.951,00:18:39.744,How long are you going to hold a grudge?
00:18:39.786,00:18:44.415,It's been seven years!
00:18:44.457,00:18:49.503,- You need me! And I need you.
00:18:49.545,00:18:54.216,Puss! You got any idea what they do to eggs in San Ricardo prison?
00:18:57.428,00:19:03.059,"I'll tell you this, my friend: it ain't over easy."
00:19:03.101,00:19:05.686,Ohhh!
00:19:07.313,00:19:08.940,Adios...
00:19:08.982,00:19:11.191,...Humpty Dumpty.
00:19:17.323,00:19:19.117,"Oh, this is bad. This is bad."
00:19:19.158,00:19:21.368,"Don't worry, I'll take care of it."
00:19:21.410,00:19:23.830,I know how to speak meow.
00:19:23.871,00:19:29.794,"...sad story with your twisted lies, in your greasy shell that smells like old ham!"
00:19:29.836,00:19:46.352,I should crack Look what I found.
00:19:46.393,00:19:49.022,Someone forgot his money.
00:19:51.983,00:19:54.944,"Oh, you are dangerous."
00:19:56.236,00:19:59.281,"Well, Humpty says you like danger."
00:20:00.950,00:20:05.121,Just think of all the trouble we can get into.
00:20:07.540,00:20:10.168,The two of us together.
00:20:10.209,00:20:14.588,We can steal a lot of golden eggs.
00:20:15.422,00:20:16.674,Hmm?
00:20:20.344,00:20:22.680,And... you owe me.
00:20:22.722,00:20:25.683,- I owe you?
00:20:25.725,00:20:28.561,You hit me in the head with a guitar.
00:20:28.602,00:20:30.813,I regret the guitar.
00:20:30.855,00:20:33.399,"OK, I forgive you."
00:20:33.440,00:20:35.818,So... you're in?
00:20:37.778,00:20:42.116,"There is one teeny, tiny, itty-bitty problem."
00:20:42.158,00:20:44.243,And what is that?
00:20:44.284,00:20:47.371,You work for the egg!
00:20:47.413,00:20:49.207,"Oh, come on, Puss."
00:20:49.248,00:20:52.752,What happened between you and Humpty that was so bad?
00:20:54.754,00:20:57.631,I am afraid with me and Humpty...
00:20:57.673,00:21:00.801,are too deep.
00:21:05.305,00:21:08.267,It all started a long time ago.
00:21:08.308,00:21:13.522,"Oh, no, no, no. You really don't have to tell me - your whole life story, please."
00:21:14.607,00:21:18.569,It is at times quite... painful.
00:21:18.611,00:21:20.905,"OK, here we go."
00:21:20.947,00:21:25.826,It was a year in which the rain had not fallen.
00:21:25.868,00:21:30.081,The wind was big and the basket was small.
00:21:30.123,00:21:37.880,"For days, I bounced along, a hungry little kitten with no milk, no mama and no litter box."
00:21:37.922,00:21:42.676,Until I came to rest at a home for lost children.
00:21:53.062,00:21:58.192,"And like a mother, she took me into her heart and raised me as her own."
00:22:02.488,00:22:04.157,Silencio.
00:22:04.198,00:22:05.992,She was an angel of kindness.
00:22:06.033,00:22:08.577,Silencio!
00:22:10.955,00:22:14.583,I'd like to introduce a new boy joining us.
00:22:14.625,00:22:18.545,"It's OK, pequeno."
00:22:22.300,00:22:23.801,Go on.
00:22:29.182,00:22:32.768,was the moment I met...
00:22:32.810,00:22:34.812,Humpty Alexander Dumpty.
00:22:36.939,00:22:39.233,You're sitting in Little Boy Blue's chair.
00:22:40.526,00:22:42.069,"Oh, come on. Is this necessary?"
00:22:42.111,00:22:44.155,Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
00:22:44.197,00:22:45.906,"Who asked you, breakfast?"
00:22:45.948,00:22:50.995,"Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue: If you're going to blow your top, you blow your horn instead, right?"
00:22:51.037,00:22:52.955,- Let's spin him.
00:22:52.997,00:22:54.790,Please don't spin me.
00:22:54.832,00:22:57.335,Not again! No!
00:22:57.375,00:23:02.798,"beans, the egg stood up for me, and I decided then..."
00:23:02.840,00:23:05.843,...that I would always have his back.
00:23:12.892,00:23:16.896,Wow! That was very impressive. Thanks!
00:23:21.359,00:23:26.364,about this strange little egg that intrigued me.
00:23:42.838,00:23:45.383,"Oh, it's you."
00:23:45.423,00:23:47.134,I've been collecting for months now.
00:23:47.176,00:23:50.846,You never know when you're gonna get lucky. Know what I mean?
00:23:50.888,00:23:53.891,is what they are.
00:23:54.558,00:23:56.018,Hello?
00:23:56.060,00:24:00.689,You gonna tell all the other kids that I believe in magic now?
00:24:02.691,00:24:04.818,No? What's your name?
00:24:06.195,00:24:07.905,"You don't say much, do you?"
00:24:07.947,00:24:10.908,"Well, I think I'll call you Sparky."
00:24:11.575,00:24:13.119,Whiskers?
00:24:13.160,00:24:14.578,Zoltar!
00:24:16.330,00:24:18.958,How about Puss?
00:24:18.999,00:24:23.129,of imagination and invention.
00:24:23.170,00:24:24.713,50 feet down there?
00:24:24.755,00:24:30.719,Here we go.
00:24:30.761,00:24:33.847,"Look at me, Puss!"
00:24:36.309,00:24:40.813,and adventures beyond my wildest dreams.
00:24:40.854,00:24:53.867,"Oh, when I find those magic beans, they'll grow a vine straight up into the clouds, where a terrible and a fearsome giant hoards his greatest treasure: the Golden Goose."
00:24:53.909,00:24:55.911,"Oh, the Golden Goose."
00:24:55.953,00:25:01.917,Just one of her golden eggs could set me for life.
00:25:01.959,00:25:03.836,"It's my destiny, Puss."
00:25:03.877,00:25:08.590,"I can't really explain it, but I just feel like I belong up there."
00:25:13.595,00:25:16.056,"Oh, boy. This is awkward."
00:25:16.098,00:25:19.852,This is kind of a solo dream here.
00:25:19.893,00:25:23.063,"I don't need any dead weight, you know, holding me down."
00:25:25.024,00:25:28.235,What are you doing?
00:25:28.277,00:25:32.031,"The eye thing that you're doing, that is really splendid."
00:25:32.072,00:25:35.242,"OK, let me just think for a second. All right... OK."
00:25:35.284,00:25:42.082,"Uh... This is crazy, but... I am considering a partnership."
00:25:43.501,00:25:45.543,I just need to know one thing.
00:25:46.295,00:25:47.713,Can you commit?
00:25:47.754,00:25:50.341,Si... I can commit.
00:25:50.383,00:25:53.677,"Oh, you can talk!"
00:25:59.016,00:26:01.935,of Bean Club...
00:26:01.977,00:26:05.314,...you do not talk about Bean Club.
00:26:05.356,00:26:07.107,Second rule of Bean Club...
00:26:07.149,00:26:11.445,...is you don't talk about Bean Club. You ready?
00:26:11.487,00:26:13.364,Ready.
00:26:13.406,00:26:21.080,"From this day forth, it shall be known never alone, always together, Humpty and Puss..."
00:26:22.622,00:26:29.505,we were united on a great adventure to find the magic beans.
00:26:29.547,00:26:30.923,Help me up.
00:26:30.964,00:26:32.632,Egg me.
00:26:32.674,00:26:34.385,Humpty was the brains...
00:26:34.427,00:26:37.179,- I never saw him!
00:26:37.221,00:26:40.974,I was the skill.
00:26:44.228,00:26:50.484,"Well, we got red beans, we got green beans, coffee beans, lima beans, but no magic beans."
00:26:50.526,00:26:52.610,Would you care for a jelly bean?
00:26:52.652,00:26:54.280,"Oh, thank you."
00:26:54.321,00:26:56.865,meant everything to us.
00:26:56.907,00:27:00.536,the most important thing.
00:27:00.578,00:27:02.413,"That's me and you, Puss."
00:27:03.705,00:27:05.332,Me and you.
00:27:05.374,00:27:07.918,But we never did find them.
00:27:07.960,00:27:15.884,"And as years passed, the quest for magic beans seemed more and more like the dreams of a child."
00:27:15.926,00:27:18.596,- Aw!
00:27:18.636,00:27:21.639,Humpty and I looked for trouble...
00:27:21.681,00:27:23.517,...and often found it.
00:27:23.559,00:27:25.478,"Third time this month, Imelda."
00:27:25.519,00:27:27.813,Next time is jail time.
00:27:30.107,00:27:32.650,They are thieves.
00:27:36.489,00:27:39.617,You are better than this.
00:27:39.657,00:27:42.953,I believe in you with all my heart.
00:27:42.995,00:27:46.706,Please do not let me down.
00:27:46.748,00:27:51.211,I hate this place. I cannot wait for us to get out of here.
00:27:52.630,00:27:55.090,Throw a rock.
00:27:57.759,00:27:59.178,"Oh, boy. We should go."
00:28:03.723,00:28:04.891,Ha!
00:28:06.644,00:28:08.521,- Aah!
00:28:17.363,00:28:19.198,He saved the Comandante's mother!
00:28:19.239,00:28:21.659,He saved the Comandante's mother!
00:28:27.414,00:28:30.083,You saved my mother.
00:28:30.125,00:28:33.587,Senor Puss... he is a hero!
00:28:35.172,00:28:41.428,Today we see that courage and bravery come in all sizes!
00:28:41.470,00:28:46.308,that one moment would change my whole life.
00:28:46.350,00:28:49.061,"These are for you, my boy."
00:28:49.102,00:28:54.107,Wear them as a symbol of honor and justice.
00:28:54.149,00:28:57.986,"I will make you proud, Mama."
00:28:58.028,00:29:03.242,"You already have, my Puss In Boots."
00:29:05.244,00:29:11.958,"to give a cat boots, but, whoa!"
00:29:12.000,00:29:15.629,And as the light of my path grew brighter...
00:29:15.671,00:29:19.633,...Humpty's road grew ever darker.
00:29:25.889,00:29:27.725,"Gracias, Comandante."
00:29:27.766,00:29:30.269,Be careful of the company you keep.
00:29:32.396,00:29:33.897,I know! I know.
00:29:33.939,00:29:35.524,I never should have tried something without you.
00:29:35.566,00:29:37.943,"You're not stealing lollipops anymore, Humpty."
00:29:37.984,00:29:39.403,This is getting serious.
00:29:39.445,00:29:41.780,You're right. We have to be smarter about this.
00:29:41.821,00:29:43.741,"Here, look."
00:29:43.782,00:29:46.993,I've been casing the silversmith and it's perfect.
00:29:47.035,00:29:49.747,"You and me, in and out, 50 seconds tops."
00:29:49.788,00:29:52.416,Will you put that away!
00:29:52.458,00:29:55.252,These people have done nothing to us!
00:29:55.294,00:29:58.838,Our home?
00:29:58.880,00:30:02.426,You get some fancy boots and now you're too good for me?
00:30:02.468,00:30:05.387,- That is not true.
00:30:05.429,00:30:08.348,"We're orphans! All we got is each other, you understand?"
00:30:08.390,00:30:09.975,We are better than this.
00:30:11.310,00:30:12.978,But we're partners.
00:30:13.019,00:30:15.939,We are brothers.
00:30:15.981,00:30:18.692,But I am not stealing anymore.
00:30:20.902,00:30:23.822,would not give up so easily.
00:30:25.658,00:30:28.034,It's Boy Blue and his gang.
00:30:28.076,00:30:30.412,They're coming for me.
00:30:30.454,00:30:32.623,We gotta go. Help me up the wall. Get me up the wall. Hurry!
00:30:32.665,00:30:34.166,Hurry!
00:30:46.011,00:30:48.347,"OK, I got everything."
00:30:48.388,00:30:50.098,How could you do this to me?!
00:30:50.140,00:30:52.434,I did you a favor!
00:30:52.476,00:30:55.521,This is the money of the people!
00:31:00.066,00:31:02.152,You disgrace those boots!
00:31:02.194,00:31:04.196,"Comandante, please, I can explain!"
00:31:04.237,00:31:05.947,Arrest them!
00:31:05.989,00:31:07.866,- Heyah!
00:31:09.535,00:31:11.662,Get to the bridge!
00:31:11.704,00:31:14.914,- You tricked me!
00:31:24.132,00:31:25.217,Mama...
00:31:25.258,00:31:27.260,Pequeno.
00:31:27.927,00:31:29.137,Oh! Watch out!
00:31:33.141,00:31:35.018,Oh! Oof!
00:31:45.362,00:31:46.697,"- Oh, no."
00:31:46.739,00:31:48.948,"Puss, I can't get up."
00:31:48.990,00:31:51.493,Puss! Help me.
00:31:51.535,00:31:53.119,Freeze!
00:31:53.746,00:31:55.622,"Puss, save me!"
00:31:56.498,00:31:58.709,Save yourself.
00:32:14.725,00:32:18.687,I cared about that day.
00:32:19.479,00:32:21.440,My brother.
00:32:21.481,00:32:23.108,My honor.
00:32:23.149,00:32:26.027,My home.
00:32:26.069,00:32:31.116,All I thought about was the disappointment in my mama's eyes.
00:32:32.158,00:32:34.870,And I have been running ever since.
00:32:38.874,00:32:41.835,The egg betrayed me.
00:32:41.877,00:32:45.380,His lies cost me everything.
00:32:47.925,00:32:49.968,- Hey!
00:32:50.009,00:32:52.512,want to fix the past?
00:32:55.766,00:32:57.517,I can't get down.
00:33:06.192,00:33:10.322,Listen. A day...
00:33:06.192,00:33:12.825,A day doesn't go by when I don't think about what I lost.
00:33:14.827,00:33:17.663,I lost my best friend.
00:33:17.704,00:33:19.873,My only friend.
00:33:19.915,00:33:22.208,And I get it now.
00:33:19.915,00:33:25.211,I got greedy and desperate and I let you down.
00:33:25.253,00:33:27.965,"All I'm asking for, Puss, is a second chance."
00:33:28.006,00:33:32.093,Give me that second chance and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.
00:33:33.136,00:33:34.930,"Please, Puss."
00:33:34.972,00:33:38.266,Let me show you what our friendship meant to me.
00:33:42.980,00:33:45.732,- I will do it.
00:33:45.774,00:33:51.029,"I will do this for my mother and for San Ricardo, not for you."
00:33:51.070,00:33:54.574,We are not partners and we are not friends.
00:33:55.993,00:34:01.122,"OK. I promise this time, I will not let you down."
00:34:04.083,00:34:06.962,I think we got our Bean Club back.
00:34:26.231,00:34:28.191,Humpty's plan better work.
00:34:28.233,00:34:31.069,"Listen, you just need to worry about your part."
00:34:31.110,00:34:33.572,Don't screw it up.
00:34:33.613,00:34:35.991,- What?
00:34:36.033,00:34:38.785,I don't need style advice from Mr. Dusty Boots.
00:34:38.827,00:34:39.995,Huh?!
00:34:47.085,00:34:48.879,"Come on, Puss. Now!"
00:34:52.716,00:34:55.677,"Our biological clocks are tickin', darlin'."
00:34:55.719,00:34:56.929,You got to look at the big picture.
00:34:56.970,00:34:59.514,- What's your problem?
00:34:59.556,00:35:01.934,"Listen, I put a lot of work into my body."
00:35:01.975,00:35:05.144,I look good and I am not just gonna throw that away.
00:35:08.023,00:35:10.108,- What?
00:35:10.149,00:35:11.985,- Look.
00:35:12.027,00:35:13.946,you have a baby.
00:35:20.702,00:35:23.455,to be at home with no diapers and baby socks.
00:35:23.496,00:35:26.541,"You don't have to, Jill."
00:35:26.583,00:35:29.127,"We got ten hungry piggies, there in the back."
00:35:29.168,00:35:32.047,You can practice on them.
00:35:32.089,00:35:34.007,Hamhock's my favorite.
00:35:34.049,00:35:35.801,- Shh!
00:35:35.842,00:35:38.011,Why are you not using your claws?!
00:35:38.053,00:35:40.221,Would you please just shut up! I'm on it!
00:35:40.263,00:35:41.848,Just use your claws!
00:35:41.890,00:35:43.516,- Be quiet.
00:35:43.558,00:35:45.268,"I don't have any claws, all right?!"
00:35:48.855,00:35:50.899,- Shh. Shh. Shh.
00:35:53.693,00:35:56.738,"There, there."
00:35:58.865,00:36:01.451,to pretend we had that monkey one time...?
00:36:01.493,00:36:03.453,- You babysit.
00:36:03.495,00:36:06.247,- Soft paws.
00:36:08.834,00:36:10.502,Well?
00:36:12.170,00:36:15.048,"Hello, beans of legend."
00:36:15.090,00:36:18.885,- Let's go.
00:36:25.266,00:36:28.812,"Well, well, well."
00:36:28.854,00:36:31.648,You messed with our baby.
00:36:33.108,00:36:37.529,And you took my beans.
00:36:37.570,00:36:38.822,- Sausage bomb!
00:36:44.953,00:36:48.123,for this! Soul-sucking cats!
00:36:49.666,00:36:51.084,Signal the egg!
00:36:52.585,00:36:54.087,Yes!
00:36:58.299,00:36:59.968,- OK.
00:37:00.010,00:37:02.428,- Set.
00:37:02.470,00:37:04.806,Ow!
00:37:17.443,00:37:19.905,"- Oh, my God!"
00:37:27.204,00:37:28.496,Whoa!
00:37:37.505,00:37:40.258,"All right, cat."
00:37:42.052,00:37:44.888,Is it true a cat always lands on its feet?
00:37:44.930,00:37:48.349,No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!
00:37:48.391,00:37:50.102,"Well, let's find out."
00:37:50.143,00:37:51.477,Heyah!
00:37:51.519,00:37:53.730,- Heyah!
00:37:57.525,00:37:59.152,"See, I told you I wouldn't let you down!"
00:37:59.194,00:38:02.739,- You think this is over? Ha!
00:38:08.494,00:38:09.746,"Hey, that was close!"
00:38:15.835,00:38:17.087,Heyah!
00:38:20.173,00:38:21.424,Now!
00:38:24.219,00:38:27.973,We just got to make it to that bridge! Hang on!
00:38:29.307,00:38:32.269,"- Humpty, there is no bridge!"
00:38:43.947,00:38:46.283,We're going to die!
00:38:58.962,00:39:00.922,I hate cats.
00:39:00.964,00:39:02.799,This is war!
00:39:06.011,00:39:09.597,- Whoo!
00:39:11.308,00:39:13.726,Giant's castle...
00:39:13.768,00:39:15.436,...here we come.
00:39:17.814,00:39:20.275,to the egg.
00:39:20.317,00:39:23.111,This was a team effort.
00:39:23.153,00:39:26.572,"I mean, flaws. That was what I meant, not claws."
00:39:26.614,00:39:28.616,He's not a cat.
00:39:28.658,00:39:30.118,Not to say there's anything wrong...
00:39:30.160,00:39:31.870,I don't want to talk about it.
00:39:31.911,00:39:33.288,Got it.
00:39:34.747,00:39:36.457,"OK, we should be close!"
00:39:36.499,00:39:39.336,Keep your eyes out for any strange cloud activity!
00:39:39.377,00:39:46.634,"I am called Kitty Softpaws because I'll steal you blind, and you'll never know I was there."
00:39:52.098,00:39:54.559,Kitty...
00:39:54.600,00:39:56.728,...you are not as good as they say.
00:39:58.063,00:40:00.732,You're better.
00:40:03.318,00:40:06.404,I will respect your privacy.
00:40:09.782,00:40:13.411,OK. I'll tell you.
00:40:13.452,00:40:20.293,"I was just a stray, but I had beautiful claws."
00:40:20.335,00:40:24.047,"One day, a really nice couple took me in."
00:40:24.089,00:40:26.465,Gave me milk every morning.
00:40:26.507,00:40:28.134,Loved me.
00:40:29.719,00:40:34.891,Maybe I scratched their curtains or played too rough with the hamster.
00:40:34.933,00:40:37.310,I don't know why they did it.
00:40:37.352,00:40:40.188,But they took my claws.
00:40:41.689,00:40:43.900,Cat people are crazy.
00:40:45.902,00:40:48.654,"Hey, stop! Stop the coach!"
00:40:55.203,00:40:57.830,Ooh! Whoo!
00:41:05.130,00:41:10.009,"believe this, Puss?"
00:41:10.051,00:41:13.054,After all these years.
00:41:14.513,00:41:17.725,Here. I want you to plant them.
00:41:23.481,00:41:25.858,That... is a strange cloud.
00:41:28.694,00:41:30.529,This is it!
00:41:30.571,00:41:32.324,"It's happening, hurry!"
00:41:34.951,00:41:36.744,This way!
00:41:36.786,00:41:38.746,"Good, good. Come on!"
00:41:38.788,00:41:40.999,Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.
00:41:41.040,00:41:43.084,Hole! Right here.
00:41:46.087,00:41:48.714,Now place the beans.
00:41:48.756,00:41:51.717,"carefully, please."
00:41:51.759,00:41:54.929,Not on top of each other.
00:41:54.971,00:41:59.017,"OK, good. Very good."
00:42:09.110,00:42:11.154,Whoa.
00:42:42.435,00:42:43.728,What's happening here?
00:42:43.769,00:42:45.771,Maybe the magic rubbed off in your pocket?
00:42:45.813,00:42:46.856,That's impossible.
00:42:46.898,00:42:48.900,"OK, OK."
00:42:48.941,00:42:51.110,"You know, I read somewhere that plants have feelings."
00:42:51.152,00:42:55.198,"So, come on... say something nice to it."
00:42:55.240,00:42:57.242,OK.
00:42:57.283,00:42:59.911,Let me just think for a second.
00:42:59.952,00:43:01.246,"Hi, little plant."
00:43:08.586,00:43:10.046,Whoa!
00:43:27.772,00:43:28.814,Yow!
00:43:28.856,00:43:30.149,Oh!
00:44:21.117,00:44:24.162,"Uh, guys? Whoa!"
00:44:24.203,00:44:26.164,Humpty!
00:44:26.205,00:44:27.499,I do not see him.
00:44:27.540,00:44:29.375,I don't see him anywhere.
00:44:29.417,00:44:31.710,You sound... weird.
00:44:31.752,00:44:35.798,Ah! It's the thin air!
00:44:35.840,00:44:39.677,Come on in!
00:44:44.807,00:44:47.685,"The cloud, it tickles my nose."
00:44:49.020,00:44:50.980,That's because they effervesce!
00:44:51.022,00:44:52.565,Who knew? Ho-ho!
00:44:58.446,00:44:59.531,Come on.
00:45:17.507,00:45:19.551,Gotcha!
00:45:22.637,00:45:24.639,- Meow.
00:45:24.681,00:45:28.351,"Hey, Puss. What do you think? Do I shave?"
00:45:29.477,00:45:31.145,Let me show you something.
00:45:37.610,00:45:42.490,"Somewhere down there, there are two little kids..."
00:45:42.532,00:45:48.538,"And they're laying on a hill, staring at the clouds, dreaming about the future."
00:45:48.580,00:45:51.207,"That was me and you, Puss."
00:45:51.249,00:45:53.334,Me and you.
00:45:56.379,00:46:00.341,You might want to take a look at this.
00:46:08.600,00:46:11.060,"OK, time to suit up."
00:46:11.102,00:46:12.562,Humpty!
00:46:12.604,00:46:14.063,in with the golden eggs.
00:46:18.234,00:46:20.777,"- Brilliant or what, huh?"
00:46:18.234,00:46:24.031,"- Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!"
00:46:24.073,00:46:26.492,What? Are you embarrassed?
00:46:26.534,00:46:27.993,I'm not.
00:46:30.413,00:46:32.957,"Puss, remember when everyone was laughing at Bean Club?"
00:46:32.998,00:46:36.127,Ha-ha! We are!
00:46:46.763,00:46:48.765,Wow!
00:47:00.901,00:47:04.071,That is our target.
00:47:04.113,00:47:06.449,"Hey, you don't sound like an elf anymore."
00:47:06.491,00:47:08.242,It's because the air pressure in here is normal.
00:47:08.284,00:47:09.452,Let's go.
00:47:13.038,00:47:17.084,"So here is the plan: You two get the golden eggs, I will fight the giant."
00:47:17.126,00:47:19.962,There's no giant to fight.
00:47:20.004,00:47:22.507,- What?!
00:47:22.548,00:47:26.051,"Jack and the Beanstalk, Chapter 14: Giant Takes A Big Dirt Nap?"
00:47:26.093,00:47:30.931,- Ahh! Ankle burn.
00:47:30.973,00:47:33.810,- Wha... What was that?
00:47:33.850,00:47:36.395,It's the monster that guards the Golden Goose.
00:47:36.437,00:47:39.440,"Legend has it that if you look at it, you'll turn to stone."
00:47:39.482,00:47:42.652,But nobody really knows because nobody's walked away from it alive.
00:47:42.694,00:47:44.779,Follow me and keep quiet.
00:47:54.622,00:47:57.166,- Shh! Humpty!
00:47:57.208,00:47:59.335,Everything's rubbing and pinching!
00:47:59.377,00:48:01.337,I need powder!
00:48:17.395,00:48:19.397,How are we going to get across?
00:48:19.438,00:48:21.065,- Champagne.
00:48:24.443,00:48:25.778,Cheers!
00:48:37.373,00:48:40.000,Do not worry.
00:48:41.960,00:48:45.548,What are you gonna do?
00:48:45.590,00:48:49.093,"Please, stop bringing up the guitar."
00:49:09.447,00:49:12.157,- Hurry!
00:49:13.492,00:49:15.077,Hide!
00:49:22.919,00:49:24.503,Shh! Humpty!
00:49:24.545,00:49:26.547,I'm hyperventilating!
00:49:26.589,00:49:29.801,I said I couldn't breathe and then you zipped the thing over my mouth!
00:49:29.842,00:49:33.095,"Shh! Hey, hey. You got to get it together. Come on!"
00:49:33.137,00:49:34.472,OK.
00:49:49.403,00:49:54.575,It's egg paradise!
00:49:54.617,00:49:57.578,"It's so beautiful, I feel like I belong here!"
00:50:00.456,00:50:01.958,Whoo!
00:50:03.459,00:50:05.962,Golden eggs. Oh!
00:50:06.796,00:50:08.547,Grab as many as you can.
00:50:08.589,00:50:13.218,going to be like chicken size.
00:50:13.260,00:50:18.056,Can you imagine laying one of these? Ouch!
00:50:18.098,00:50:20.351,Puss! Ow!
00:50:21.644,00:50:23.980,How are we supposed to get these out of here?
00:50:24.020,00:50:25.606,- I don't know.
00:50:27.149,00:50:29.902,"Oh, my."
00:50:36.742,00:50:39.954,Just look at her.
00:50:47.169,00:50:50.297,- Oh!
00:50:50.339,00:50:53.009,"Oh, yeah."
00:50:53.049,00:50:56.637,- I think she likes you.
00:50:59.515,00:51:01.099,Let's just take her.
00:51:01.141,00:51:02.935,Wait a minute.
00:51:02.977,00:51:04.770,We don't know what happens if we take her.
00:51:04.812,00:51:09.441,- I know what happens if we don't take her: we got nothing.
00:51:09.483,00:51:13.654,"Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper."
00:51:23.330,00:51:24.665,Almost there!
00:51:34.425,00:51:35.634,Hang on!
00:51:41.724,00:51:44.643,- Ow!
00:51:44.685,00:51:46.520,- Whoa!
00:52:15.507,00:52:16.842,Kitty!
00:52:19.011,00:52:20.679,What are you doing?
00:52:48.749,00:52:50.417,"Come here, you."
00:52:54.296,00:52:55.464,Gotcha!
00:52:56.799,00:52:59.051,She's mine now!
00:53:08.144,00:53:09.728,Hello!
00:53:15.191,00:53:18.612,"Oh, no!"
00:53:22.616,00:53:25.995,"No, no! It's not supposed to be this way!"
00:53:27.621,00:53:29.498,- Puss?
00:53:55.024,00:53:57.026,"Thanks, Ginger."
00:54:02.406,00:54:05.492,"Um, we should maybe cut that down."
00:54:09.413,00:54:12.917,"You finally got that family you wanted, Jack."
00:54:12.958,00:54:15.211,- Did you hear that?
00:54:15.251,00:54:16.837,I think he just called me Daddy.
00:54:16.879,00:54:20.256,"Oh! He looks just like you, Jack."
00:54:20.298,00:54:21.550,Thank you.
00:54:36.815,00:54:39.526,Huh?
00:54:44.280,00:54:47.743,- I do believe that's our cue.
00:54:51.287,00:54:53.582,To paying back San Ricardo!
00:54:53.624,00:54:55.918,To being rich!
00:54:55.960,00:54:57.920,Ole!
00:55:07.930,00:55:10.182,Ha! Ha!
00:55:12.017,00:55:14.394,- You.
00:55:18.523,00:55:20.734,"One, two, cha-cha-cha!"
00:55:20.776,00:55:23.154,"Three, four, cha-cha-cha! One, two..."
00:55:23.195,00:55:24.822,- What?!
00:55:26.322,00:55:30.577,"There is one word for you, Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!"
00:55:30.619,00:55:35.457,"I know you have quite a reputation with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times."
00:55:35.499,00:55:38.710,I've also been known as the... Furry Lover!
00:55:40.462,00:55:43.048,But that was before I met you.
00:55:43.090,00:55:44.340,"You don't know me, Puss."
00:55:44.382,00:55:46.593,I'm not who you think I am.
00:55:46.635,00:55:48.220,I'm all about the score.
00:55:48.262,00:55:53.433,Come on. Look me in the eyes and tell me all you care about is the gold.
00:55:54.350,00:55:55.602,Puss...
00:55:55.644,00:55:57.395,Kitty...
00:55:57.437,00:55:58.897,"- Oh, my God!"
00:56:03.110,00:56:05.529,his animal magnetism.
00:56:05.570,00:56:07.698,You stay focused!
00:56:07.739,00:56:09.325,- Ah!
00:56:17.249,00:56:26.842,"been thinking, Miss Softpaws, that when we go our separate ways, we can go our separate ways... together."
00:56:28.802,00:56:30.888,"Puss, you have to go, now."
00:56:30.929,00:56:34.766,You do not have to push me away anymore. You can trust me.
00:56:34.808,00:56:39.104,- But...
00:56:39.146,00:56:42.066,- We did it!
00:56:42.107,00:56:43.901,"I'm calling it a night, guys."
00:56:43.942,00:56:45.777,"Kitty, stay up with us."
00:56:45.819,00:56:50.241,hairball coming on.
00:56:50.282,00:56:53.409,"OK, yeah."
00:56:53.451,00:56:55.704,"We should, uh, give her some privacy."
00:56:58.040,00:57:01.877,I never thought we would get to here.
00:57:01.919,00:57:06.882,After all we went through...
00:57:08.633,00:57:11.595,It is good to have my brother back.
00:57:11.636,00:57:14.681,Yep. Sure is.
00:57:14.723,00:57:17.309,a big day tomorrow.
00:57:17.351,00:57:20.687,Pretty exciting stuff.
00:57:20.729,00:57:23.440,We should get some rest.
00:57:23.481,00:57:26.651,"- Good night, Humpty."
00:57:32.199,00:57:34.701,- Canasta!
00:58:12.948,00:58:15.326,Jack and Jill.
00:58:15.951,00:58:17.744,Kitty?
00:58:17.786,00:58:19.288,Humpty?
00:58:21.457,00:58:23.375,I will find you.
00:58:27.838,00:58:30.048,- Get out of here!
00:59:15.677,00:59:17.179,Huh?
00:59:23.601,00:59:25.103,Be gone!
00:59:26.480,00:59:29.774,Gold? I... I have gold!
00:59:29.816,00:59:32.528,egg's trying to bribe us.
00:59:32.569,00:59:34.571,With our own gold.
00:59:34.612,00:59:37.741,is a little breakfast.
00:59:37.782,00:59:40.035,"your eggs, pumpkin?"
00:59:40.077,00:59:42.079,"Humpty, no!"
00:59:53.382,00:59:55.426,What is going on?
00:59:55.467,00:59:59.804,"It's a surprise party, and the surprise is on you."
00:59:59.846,01:00:02.474,Looks like the cat's out of the bag.
01:00:02.516,01:00:04.142,You were in cahoots?!
01:00:04.184,01:00:06.937,"Oh, yeah!"
01:00:10.023,01:00:13.944,I spent a lot of time in prison preparing for this.
01:00:13.985,01:00:16.821,- You set me up.
01:00:16.863,01:00:21.243,You think this was all about getting the gold and clearing your name?
01:00:21.285,01:00:26.248,This little adventure was about one thing.
01:00:26.915,01:00:28.750,Revenge.
01:00:28.792,01:00:33.505,"You never knew it, Puss, but I was always..."
01:00:55.735,01:00:58.530,"You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?"
01:00:58.572,01:01:00.991,"- Well, so did I."
01:01:01.032,01:01:02.618,You left me on that bridge!
01:01:02.659,01:01:04.953,You abandoned me when I needed you the most!
01:01:04.995,01:01:07.623,- What happened to brothers forever?!
01:01:07.664,01:01:09.791,"Well, now you're finally gonna know what it feels like!"
01:01:09.833,01:01:12.836,"You know, to trust someone and have them stab you in the back!"
01:01:12.877,01:01:14.754,Guards!
01:01:14.796,01:01:19.717,"Puss In Boots, you're under arrest for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!"
01:01:19.759,01:01:21.845,Consider this the final meeting of Bean Club.
01:01:21.886,01:01:25.056,- I should scramble you with onions!
01:01:25.098,01:01:28.393,You should never have come back.
01:01:31.896,01:01:34.107,"Do not fight them, please."
01:01:34.149,01:01:37.110,Mama! Listen to me.
01:01:37.152,01:01:41.865,"No. Puss, no more running."
01:01:41.906,01:01:45.910,Please stop breaking my heart and face what you have done.
01:01:48.997,01:01:50.832,"I'm sorry, Mama."
01:01:51.667,01:01:53.335,I let you down.
01:01:56.421,01:01:58.340,Paws where we can see them!
01:01:59.591,01:02:01.759,Turn around... slow.
01:02:03.554,01:02:05.096,Slower!
01:02:11.978,01:02:15.190,Step into the carrier...
01:02:23.031,01:02:26.743,"Attention, attention, everyone!"
01:02:26.784,01:02:31.998,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, the Golden Goose of legend!"
01:02:37.045,01:02:40.173,"Kitty? Not you, too?"
01:02:44.844,01:02:47.013,Gold for everyone!
01:02:47.055,01:02:49.974,Boo! Boo! Boo!
01:02:50.016,01:02:52.728,"We got some fresh, hot gold here, people!"
01:02:52.769,01:02:57.065,Step right up! Get it hot!
01:02:57.107,01:03:00.277,Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!
01:03:00.318,01:03:03.113,Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!
01:03:03.154,01:03:06.866,Huevos! Huevos! Huevos!
01:03:06.908,01:03:08.368,One hat.
01:03:09.077,01:03:11.329,One belt.
01:03:11.371,01:03:16.710,"And two boots, once a symbol of honor."
01:03:18.211,01:03:20.714,One bottle of catnip?
01:03:20.756,01:03:23.841,Uh... it is for my glaucoma.
01:03:27.011,01:03:31.015,"This is where you belong, outlaw."
01:03:31.057,01:03:35.395,And this is where you will stay... forever.
01:03:52.912,01:03:55.915,"No, no."
01:04:07.511,01:04:12.182,"Well, it looks like the egg got what he wanted."
01:04:12.223,01:04:14.184,You're talking about Humpty?
01:04:16.019,01:04:19.648,I used to share this cell with that smelly thing.
01:04:19.690,01:04:22.942,Happiest day of my life was when he left.
01:04:22.984,01:04:25.362,Till I realized he stole my magic beans.
01:04:25.403,01:04:28.824,Wait! Wait! Wait!
01:04:28.865,01:04:31.909,- Hey! What's your name?
01:04:34.746,01:04:36.665,My friends call me Jack.
01:04:36.707,01:04:40.043,I traded the family cow for them beans.
01:04:40.084,01:04:43.588,"Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow. It was some other family's family cow."
01:04:43.630,01:04:45.215,That's why I got eight to ten.
01:04:45.256,01:04:49.344,Always know which cow is yours.
01:04:49.386,01:04:51.929,- Crazy man. Wake up!
01:04:51.971,01:04:54.683,- What else do you know?
01:04:54.725,01:04:58.895,"We're all goners, thanks to that little stinky!"
01:04:58.936,01:05:04.025,"I told him, I told him not to take the goose, but all he wanted was his revenge!"
01:05:04.067,01:05:06.361,Don't take the goose. Why?
01:05:08.530,01:05:13.910,That's the Golden Goose's mama.
01:05:13.951,01:05:15.286,"Oh, no."
01:05:15.328,01:05:21.793,And she will be out for blood when she comes back for her baby.
01:05:21.835,01:05:25.255,is in terrible danger!
01:05:25.296,01:05:26.840,You must listen to me!
01:05:26.882,01:05:28.466,"Quiet, you!"
01:06:00.373,01:06:05.253,- Shhh!
01:06:11.008,01:06:13.428,Open the door.
01:06:20.518,01:06:22.687,Drop the weapon.
01:06:23.688,01:06:25.649,Very good.
01:06:25.690,01:06:28.025,Step aside.
01:06:30.278,01:06:32.864,- Diablo gato!
01:06:47.086,01:06:49.005,I hope you can forgive me.
01:06:49.046,01:06:52.634,Apology accepted!
01:06:52.676,01:06:55.052,I don't really have time for you.
01:06:55.094,01:06:57.263,I have to save the town from the Great Terror!
01:06:57.305,01:06:59.265,"Wait, Puss!"
01:06:59.307,01:07:02.477,Don't you see?
01:07:02.519,01:07:08.733,I am here because you made me realize that there is something I care about more than gold.
01:07:09.317,01:07:11.110,Something?
01:07:11.152,01:07:14.447,OK. Someone.
01:07:14.489,01:07:17.158,"He's about two feet tall, wears high heels."
01:07:17.200,01:07:18.827,Handsome?
01:07:18.869,01:07:20.662,He's very handsome.
01:07:20.704,01:07:22.998,- A real beefcake?
01:07:23.039,01:07:24.582,- A stallion?
01:07:24.624,01:07:26.209,- Tiger?
01:07:26.250,01:07:30.213,does not make us even.
01:07:30.254,01:07:32.883,- Freeze!
01:07:32.924,01:07:34.843,"- No, no, no, it doesn't."
01:07:39.138,01:07:40.390,I saved you!
01:07:41.182,01:07:43.685,You owed me one.
01:07:43.727,01:07:45.353,You didn't tell me about Humpty.
01:07:47.438,01:07:49.106,So now you owe me two.
01:07:53.486,01:07:56.781,- You're a lot of work.
01:07:56.823,01:07:58.241,Ha-ha!
01:08:00.368,01:08:03.371,"You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!"
01:08:04.039,01:08:05.665,Wrong boots.
01:08:06.666,01:08:07.625,Kitty!
01:08:17.635,01:08:20.513,This is your San Ricardo weather report.
01:08:20.555,01:08:25.351,Chances of a giant goose destroying the town: 100 percent.
01:08:29.606,01:08:40.700,"always together, Come on, sweetie."
01:08:40.742,01:08:44.328,"Let's, uh, get out of here before Mama shows up."
01:08:44.370,01:08:47.290,I should make you into an egg salad sandwich!
01:08:49.960,01:08:51.711,"Give me the goose, Humpty."
01:08:51.753,01:08:53.797,"No can do, I'm afraid."
01:08:53.838,01:09:00.428,"See, the mama's on her way, and when she gets here, it's bye-bye San Ricardo and everything you ever cared about!"
01:09:00.470,01:09:04.432,"Revenge on me is one thing, but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?"
01:09:04.474,01:09:08.352,- This is our home.
01:09:08.394,01:09:12.523,I never belonged here.
01:09:12.565,01:09:18.154,"We had a plan to get out of here, but then you became a hero and you picked this place over me."
01:09:19.614,01:09:21.574,You left me with nothing.
01:09:26.412,01:09:29.290,Humpty...
01:09:31.417,01:09:33.628,But do not take it out on these people.
01:09:33.670,01:09:35.672,You are better than this!
01:09:36.923,01:09:39.134,"- No, I'm not."
01:09:39.175,01:09:41.011,I know the real Humpty.
01:09:41.052,01:09:45.306,The way you saw the world!
01:09:45.348,01:09:48.059,What happened to that guy?
01:09:52.981,01:09:55.566,I... I think it's too late.
01:09:55.608,01:09:58.153,It is never too late to do the right thing.
01:09:58.194,01:10:00.780,Together we can save San Ricardo!
01:10:06.161,01:10:10.123,"I can forgive you, Humpty, if you help me now."
01:10:10.623,01:10:12.249,Really?
01:10:12.291,01:10:14.711,After everything I put you through?
01:10:14.752,01:10:17.797,Prove to me there is still a good egg in you.
01:10:20.008,01:10:21.300,I'll try.
01:11:13.228,01:11:14.478,"Goggles, check."
01:11:14.520,01:11:16.022,Get the baby over the bridge.
01:11:16.064,01:11:17.232,I'll get the mother to follow.
01:11:17.273,01:11:20.526,OK. Give me a... Puss!
01:11:27.617,01:11:29.160,Ha-ha!
01:11:44.175,01:11:45.843,Mama Goose!
01:11:48.345,01:11:51.682,- Wait!
01:11:51.724,01:11:54.769,Just follow me and I will lead you to your baby.
01:11:59.440,01:12:02.443,No! Not that way!
01:12:04.070,01:12:05.822,"Pequeno, help!"
01:12:05.863,01:12:07.490,Hang on!
01:12:08.241,01:12:10.201,I got you!
01:12:16.874,01:12:18.835,That's my boy!
01:12:18.876,01:12:20.336,Ha!
01:12:23.339,01:12:25.967,"Come with me, Mama Goose."
01:12:39.772,01:12:41.691,"Humpty, pick up the pace!"
01:12:41.732,01:12:44.194,"I'm trying, Puss!"
01:12:49.532,01:12:52.910,"Sorry, egghead, we want more than just eggs."
01:12:52.952,01:12:54.871,So how about you give us that goose!
01:12:54.912,01:12:57.373,- Humpty!
01:12:57.414,01:13:00.376,- Get her off me!
01:13:00.417,01:13:04.297,- Nice moves.
01:13:08.926,01:13:10.136,Freeze!
01:13:13.097,01:13:16.267,"Comandante! Uh, I can explain?"
01:13:16.309,01:13:22.273,Gato! You are going back to jail if it's the last thing I do!
01:13:22.315,01:13:23.733,"Humpty, hurry!"
01:13:23.774,01:13:26.944,We're almost there!
01:13:49.800,01:13:53.012,"- Puss, help!"
01:13:53.054,01:13:55.181,Puss!
01:14:04.857,01:14:07.610,"Here we are again, right, Puss?"
01:14:09.946,01:14:13.366,"I will not leave you behind this time, Humpty."
01:14:20.331,01:14:21.832,Uh...
01:14:21.874,01:14:23.876,"I'm sorry, Puss."
01:14:23.918,01:14:25.795,I've made a mess out of everything.
01:14:25.836,01:14:29.506,- I'm a rotten egg.
01:14:29.548,01:14:32.468,"No, I'm not a person."
01:14:32.509,01:14:36.055,I'm not a bird.
01:14:37.307,01:14:39.016,I don't know what I am.
01:14:39.058,01:14:43.020,You are what you have always been.
01:14:43.062,01:14:44.730,My brother.
01:14:47.066,01:14:49.110,Brothers forever.
01:14:50.320,01:14:53.739,- Whoa!
01:15:01.914,01:15:05.918,- You can't save us both.
01:15:07.211,01:15:12.633,"Puss, you have to save the baby, or the mama will destroy San Ricardo."
01:15:14.469,01:15:16.346,It's the right thing to do.
01:15:19.432,01:15:22.393,"I will not let you go, Humpty."
01:15:23.269,01:15:25.396,I know you won't.
01:15:25.438,01:15:27.440,So I won't make you choose.
01:15:29.066,01:15:31.735,- Humpty!
01:15:51.547,01:15:55.259,I'm very sorry.
01:16:03.184,01:16:05.311,Humpty?
01:16:23.246,01:16:26.790,I always knew that you were good inside.
01:16:40.721,01:16:42.557,"Goodbye, Humpty."
01:16:57.071,01:16:58.822,It's him. Puss In Boots.
01:16:58.864,01:17:01.033,He saved us from the giant goose!
01:17:01.075,01:17:02.743,His sword is like lightning!
01:17:02.785,01:17:04.995,They say he has ten lives.
01:17:05.037,01:17:08.832,His boots are made of the finest Corinthian leather.
01:17:08.874,01:17:11.586,He only drinks whole milk.
01:17:14.547,01:17:16.090,Good leche.
01:17:16.132,01:17:19.843,He's no outlaw.
01:17:23.556,01:17:26.100,"A gift for you, Mama."
01:17:29.061,01:17:33.107,I have to go.
01:17:35.067,01:17:37.612,"I am so proud of you, my son."
01:17:40.156,01:17:45.161,"Today, you faced the past with bravery and honor."
01:17:45.202,01:17:47.830,You earned those boots.
01:17:47.871,01:17:53.085,And the people know that you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.
01:17:54.086,01:17:57.214,"I did it for you, Mama."
01:17:57.256,01:17:59.842,You will always be in my heart.
01:17:59.883,01:18:01.969,And you in mine.
01:18:04.555,01:18:06.807,Gato! Hmm?
01:18:06.849,01:18:09.352,- There he is!
01:18:51.310,01:18:55.105,"I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!"
01:19:12.998,01:19:16.793,of a cat who became a hero.
01:19:16.835,01:19:21.549,An outlaw dedicated to justice and a lover of beautiful women.
01:19:21.591,01:19:25.302,A great... great lover.
01:19:25.344,01:19:28.138,It is crazy.
01:19:28.180,01:19:31.141,I am Puss In Boots!
01:19:31.183,01:19:35.605,And my name would become legend!
01:19:35.646,01:19:37.856,- Ha-ha!
01:19:57.627,01:20:02.172,- Ha!
01:20:02.214,01:20:04.550,Whoo-hoo!
01:20:06.302,01:20:07.844,- Ha!
01:20:07.886,01:20:10.097,Meow.
01:20:18.021,01:20:19.898,Whoo-hoo-hoo!
01:20:54.517,01:20:56.727,Ohhh!
