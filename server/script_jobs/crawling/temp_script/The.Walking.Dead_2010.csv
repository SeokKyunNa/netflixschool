00:01:37.520,00:01:38.920,Little girl?
00:01:40.640,00:01:41.840,I'm a policeman.
00:01:42.520,00:01:43.680,Little girl.
00:01:48.120,00:01:50.120,"Don't be afraid, okay?"
00:01:53.080,00:01:54.440,Little girl.
00:02:13.080,00:02:14.600,"Oh, my God."
00:03:02.680,00:03:04.440,RICK: What's the difference between men and women?
00:03:04.720,00:03:07.120,"-SHANE: This a joke? -No, I'm serious."
00:03:08.440,00:03:11.080,Never met a woman who knew how to turn off a light.
00:03:11.200,00:03:12.880,They're born thinking the switch only goes one way...
00:03:14.480,00:03:18.200,"You know, they're struck blind the second they leave a room."
00:03:18.280,00:03:20.520,"I mean, the same chick, mind you."
00:03:21.160,00:03:23.760,She'll bitch about global warming.
00:03:27.120,00:03:39.400,"from the Guy Gospel and say, um, Darling, maybe you and every other pair of boobs on this planet just figure out that the light switch, you see, goes both ways, maybe we wouldn't have so much global warming."
00:03:39.680,00:03:41.880,"-You say that? -Mmm. In a way, yeah."
00:03:48.280,00:03:49.400,"So how's it with Lori, man?"
00:03:49.760,00:03:56.400,"Lately, whenever I try, everything I say makes her impatient, like she didn't want to hear it after all."
00:03:56.480,00:03:57.640,Mmm.
00:03:57.960,00:04:02.560,It's like she's pissed at me all the time and I don't know why.
00:04:04.080,00:04:06.160,"Look, man. That's just shit couples go through."
00:04:06.560,00:04:08.720,"Yeah, it's a, it's a phase."
00:04:12.960,00:04:15.360,-The last thing she said this morning... -Hmm.
00:04:15.520,00:04:18.960,Sometimes I wonder if you even care about us at all.
00:04:20.440,00:04:22.920,She said that in front of our kid.
00:04:24.760,00:04:27.600,Imagine going to school with that in your head.
00:04:34.160,00:04:36.160,"DISPATCHER: All available units, high-speed pursuit in progress."
00:04:36.280,00:04:38.560,Linden County units request local assistance.
00:04:38.720,00:04:40.120,"Highway 18 eastbound. GTA, ADW."
00:04:50.120,00:04:52.080,DISPATCHER: Suspects are two male Caucasians.
00:04:52.160,00:04:53.800,Be advised they have fired upon police officers.
00:05:01.680,00:05:06.320,"DISPATCHER: Unit 1, unit 3, to eastbound, Route 18, two miles west of Interstate 85."
00:05:06.400,00:05:08.280,Will patch in Linden County sheriff radio.
00:05:10.760,00:05:12.480,of the Route 18 intersection.
00:05:16.920,00:05:19.080,"Highway 18, EB of interstate, please advise."
00:05:25.560,00:05:28.840,Old French Road is closed down there so they're gonna head back onto 18.
00:05:30.920,00:05:33.880,Sounds like they chasing those idiots up and down every back road we've got.
00:06:05.360,00:06:07.200,"-Gun, gun, gun! -Put it down!"
00:06:13.600,00:06:14.600,Ah!
00:06:32.240,00:06:33.440,SHANE: Rick!
00:06:39.400,00:06:42.640,"I saw you get tagged, man. That scared the hell out of me."
00:06:42.720,00:06:43.760,"Me, too."
00:06:44.520,00:06:47.240,That son of a bitch shot me. You believe that?
00:06:47.400,00:06:48.800,He catch you in your vest?
00:06:49.600,00:06:50.680,Yeah.
00:06:52.480,00:06:55.040,"Shane, you do not tell Lori that happened. Ever."
00:06:59.400,00:07:00.480,"OFFICER: Police, move in!"
00:07:00.560,00:07:01.760,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:07:04.080,00:07:05.760,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:07:06.280,00:07:07.600,He's hit!
00:07:07.880,00:07:10.360,Leon! You get that ambulance down here!
00:07:10.440,00:07:12.280,You tell them there's an officer down! You do it now!
00:07:13.800,00:07:15.200,"I'm here. Hey, you look at me. You stay with me."
00:07:17.320,00:07:18.880,"I'm right here, Rick. Stay with me. You hear me?"
00:07:22.240,00:07:24.360,"I'm right here with you. Stay with me. Shh, shh."
00:07:24.440,00:07:26.440,That's it. I'm right here.
00:07:30.240,00:07:31.440,"Hey, bud."
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.720,We're still here.
00:07:35.440,00:07:37.320,We're still hanging in.
00:07:40.640,00:07:42.080,"I'm sorry, man."
00:07:42.160,00:07:45.080,I know I say the same crap every time I come in here.
00:07:48.960,00:07:50.320,Everybody pitched in on these.
00:07:50.400,00:07:52.520,"They, uh, wanted me to bring 'em down."
00:07:52.600,00:07:54.600,"They send their love, and they just..."
00:07:54.720,00:07:56.840,They hope you come back real soon.
00:08:02.080,00:08:03.840,they picked these out.
00:08:04.320,00:08:05.920,"Probably could tell, huh?"
00:08:08.080,00:08:10.960,"I'm just gonna set these on your side table, okay?"
00:08:20.000,00:08:22.800,"That vase, that's something special."
00:08:23.000,00:08:25.720,'Fess up. You steal it from your grandma Jean's house?
00:08:27.240,00:08:29.440,I hope you left her that spoon collection.
00:08:37.800,00:08:39.400,Shane?
00:08:39.880,00:08:40.880,Shane.
00:09:50.040,00:09:51.840,"Nurse, help."
00:12:32.960,00:12:33.960,Ah...
00:15:03.240,00:15:04.720,Lori.
00:15:07.440,00:15:08.640,Lori!
00:15:17.120,00:15:19.600,Lori! Carl!
00:15:36.200,00:15:37.760,Is this real?
00:15:38.440,00:15:39.800,Am I here?
00:16:51.520,00:16:52.960,-Daddy! Daddy! -RICK: Carl.
00:16:53.920,00:16:56.120,Carl. I found you.
00:17:01.680,00:17:03.760,He say something? I thought I heard him say something.
00:17:03.840,00:17:06.200,"-He called me Carl. -Son, you know they don't talk."
00:17:06.320,00:17:09.280,"Hey, Mister, what's that bandage for?"
00:17:10.640,00:17:11.800,What?
00:17:13.960,00:17:15.720,Or I will kill you.
00:17:35.960,00:17:38.000,Got that bandage changed now.
00:17:38.080,00:17:39.680,It was pretty rank.
00:17:40.440,00:17:42.400,What was the wound?
00:17:44.040,00:17:45.640,-Gunshot. -Gunshot?
00:17:47.040,00:17:48.840,What else? Anything?
00:17:49.840,00:17:51.480,Gunshot ain't enough?
00:17:53.280,00:17:55.080,"Look, I ask and you answer."
00:17:55.920,00:17:57.840,"That's common courtesy, right?"
00:18:01.200,00:18:03.480,Did you get bit?
00:18:05.960,00:18:07.480,"-Bit? -Bit, chewed."
00:18:07.720,00:18:10.280,Maybe scratched. Anything like that?
00:18:10.960,00:18:12.680,"No, I got shot."
00:18:13.560,00:18:15.800,Just shot as far as I know.
00:18:18.920,00:18:20.800,Hey. Just let me.
00:18:24.520,00:18:25.800,Feels cool enough.
00:18:26.560,00:18:28.800,Fever would've killed you by now.
00:18:29.240,00:18:30.560,I don't think I have one.
00:18:45.440,00:18:47.320,MORGAN: Come on out when you're able.
00:18:50.560,00:18:51.600,Come on.
00:19:15.240,00:19:19.120,"This place, Fred and Cindy Drake's?"
00:19:20.320,00:19:21.680,Never met 'em.
00:19:21.800,00:19:24.440,I've been here. This is their place.
00:19:24.800,00:19:26.800,It was empty when we got here.
00:19:29.760,00:19:32.520,Don't do that. They'll see the light.
00:19:33.280,00:19:35.760,There's more of them out there than usual.
00:19:35.920,00:19:39.000,I never should've fired that gun today.
00:19:39.160,00:19:41.760,Sound draws them. Now they're all over the street.
00:19:42.680,00:19:45.000,Stupid. Using a gun.
00:19:46.320,00:19:49.760,"But it all happened so fast, I didn't think."
00:19:50.040,00:19:51.720,You shot that man today.
00:19:52.600,00:19:55.680,"-Man? -You shot him in the street out front, a man."
00:19:55.800,00:19:58.560,"Friend, you need glasses. It was a walker."
00:19:59.040,00:20:03.040,Come on. Sit down before you fall down.
00:20:05.040,00:20:06.360,Here.
00:20:13.520,00:20:15.480,"Hey, mister, you even know what's going on?"
00:20:15.720,00:20:19.200,I woke up today in the hospital...
00:20:21.560,00:20:23.840,Came home and that's all I know.
00:20:26.880,00:20:28.280,"But you know about the dead people, right?"
00:20:28.360,00:20:30.320,"Yeah, I saw a lot of that."
00:20:30.760,00:20:33.240,"Out on the loading dock, piled in trucks."
00:20:33.440,00:20:35.920,"No, not the ones they put down."
00:20:36.000,00:20:38.240,"The ones they didn't, the walkers."
00:20:39.240,00:20:41.040,Like the one I shot today.
00:20:41.240,00:20:45.320,"'Cause he'd have ripped into you, tried to eat you, taken some flesh at least."
00:20:46.720,00:20:51.600,"Well, I guess if this is the first you're hearing it, I know how it must sound."
00:20:54.240,00:20:55.760,They're out there now? In the street?
00:20:55.880,00:20:57.120,Yeah.
00:20:57.440,00:20:59.760,They get more active after dark sometimes.
00:21:00.320,00:21:01.880,Maybe it's the cool air or...
00:21:01.960,00:21:04.320,"Hell, maybe it's just me firing that gun today."
00:21:04.920,00:21:07.640,But we'll be fine as long as we stay quiet.
00:21:07.720,00:21:09.880,Probably wander off by morning.
00:21:12.280,00:21:13.520,But listen.
00:21:14.720,00:21:18.600,"One thing I do know, don't you get bit."
00:21:18.720,00:21:21.840,I saw your bandage and that's what we were afraid of.
00:21:22.520,00:21:24.080,Bites kill you.
00:21:24.280,00:21:26.120,The fever burns you out.
00:21:26.200,00:21:28.080,But then after a while...
00:21:29.600,00:21:31.320,You come back.
00:21:36.560,00:21:38.120,Seen it happen.
00:21:46.560,00:21:47.680,Carl.
00:21:48.640,00:21:49.960,He your son?
00:21:50.800,00:21:53.560,"Well, you... You said his name today."
00:21:55.120,00:21:57.920,He's a little younger than your boy.
00:21:58.800,00:22:00.520,MORGAN: And he's with his mother?
00:22:02.320,00:22:03.800,I hope so.
00:22:04.360,00:22:05.400,DUANE: Dad.
00:22:06.520,00:22:07.760,Hey.
00:22:08.840,00:22:10.400,Did you ask him?
00:22:13.160,00:22:14.240,MORGAN: Your gunshot...
00:22:14.800,00:22:18.040,We got a little bet going. My boy says you're a bank robber.
00:22:20.360,00:22:22.920,"Yeah, that's me."
00:22:23.200,00:22:25.040,Deadliest Dillinger. Kapow.
00:22:29.680,00:22:30.880,Uh-huh.
00:22:34.480,00:22:36.240,"Hey, it's okay. Daddy's here."
00:22:36.320,00:22:37.440,It's nothing.
00:22:38.240,00:22:40.760,One of them must've bumped a car.
00:22:40.960,00:22:43.760,-Are you sure? -It happened once before.
00:22:45.160,00:22:46.920,Went on for a few minutes.
00:22:48.960,00:22:50.560,"Get the light, Duane."
00:22:57.240,00:22:59.480,It's the blue one down the street.
00:22:59.560,00:23:01.280,Same one as last time.
00:23:01.920,00:23:03.640,I think we're okay.
00:23:06.560,00:23:08.760,"That noise, won't it bring more of them?"
00:23:09.720,00:23:11.880,MORGAN: Nothing we can do about it now.
00:23:12.440,00:23:14.760,Just have to wait 'em out till morning.
00:23:21.000,00:23:23.160,Don't look. Get away from the windows.
00:23:24.840,00:23:26.520,I said go. Go on.
00:23:34.080,00:23:35.720,Come on. Quiet now.
00:23:36.320,00:23:38.440,"Shh, shh!"
00:24:23.120,00:24:24.680,"She, um..."
00:24:26.160,00:24:29.200,She died in that other room on that bed in there.
00:24:31.800,00:24:34.720,There was nothing I... I could do about it.
00:24:35.240,00:24:36.560,"That fever, man..."
00:24:37.800,00:24:40.520,Her skin gave off a heat like a furnace.
00:24:45.600,00:24:46.960,I should've...
00:24:47.080,00:24:49.360,"I should've put her down, man. I should've put her down."
00:24:49.440,00:24:51.000,"I know that, but I..."
00:24:53.120,00:24:56.080,You know what? I just didn't have it in me.
00:25:00.240,00:25:02.440,She's the mother of my child.
00:25:18.920,00:25:20.880,RICK: Are we sure they're dead?
00:25:21.080,00:25:23.560,I have to ask at least one more time.
00:25:23.920,00:25:27.240,"MORGAN: They dead, except for something in the brain."
00:25:27.960,00:25:29.760,That's why it's got to be the head.
00:25:50.600,00:25:53.040,"They're alive, my wife and son."
00:25:53.400,00:25:55.280,At least they were when they left.
00:25:55.360,00:25:56.920,How can you know?
00:25:57.240,00:25:58.600,By the look of this place...
00:25:58.680,00:26:00.880,I found empty drawers in the bedroom.
00:26:00.960,00:26:04.440,"They packed some clothes, not a lot, but enough to travel."
00:26:04.560,00:26:08.240,"You know anybody could've broken in here and stole them clothes, right?"
00:26:08.400,00:26:10.920,You see the framed photos on the walls?
00:26:11.520,00:26:12.520,Neither do I.
00:26:12.600,00:26:15.560,"Some random thief take those, too, you think?"
00:26:18.640,00:26:21.960,"Our photo albums, family pictures, all gone."
00:26:30.480,00:26:31.640,My wife...
00:26:32.440,00:26:33.640,Same thing.
00:26:34.400,00:26:37.800,"There I am packing survival gear, she's grabbing photo..."
00:26:40.480,00:26:42.480,They're in Atlanta I bet.
00:26:42.760,00:26:44.240,That's right.
00:26:45.240,00:26:47.080,-Why there? -MORGAN: Refugee center.
00:26:47.360,00:26:50.360,"Huge one they said, before the broadcast stopped."
00:26:50.440,00:26:53.480,"Military protection, food, shelter."
00:26:53.560,00:26:57.040,"They told people to go there, said it'd be safest."
00:26:57.120,00:26:58.960,DUANE: Plus they got that disease place.
00:26:59.200,00:27:00.800,Center for Disease Control.
00:27:00.880,00:27:03.720,Said they were working out how to solve this thing.
00:27:25.520,00:27:27.000,Pilot's still on.
00:27:31.520,00:27:33.320,-Hot water! -Ah!
00:27:33.400,00:27:35.360,"-Whoo! -That feels good, right?"
00:27:41.280,00:27:43.720,Atlanta sounds like a good deal.
00:27:43.840,00:27:45.720,Safer anyway... People.
00:27:46.880,00:27:48.880,That's where we were headed.
00:27:49.120,00:27:50.360,Things got crazy.
00:27:50.440,00:27:52.520,"Man, you wouldn't believe the panic."
00:27:52.640,00:27:54.240,Streets weren't fit to be on.
00:27:54.440,00:27:55.960,And then my...
00:27:57.480,00:27:59.760,My wife couldn't travel...
00:27:59.840,00:28:03.360,"No, not with her hurt, so we had to find a place to lay low."
00:28:03.440,00:28:05.520,And then after she died...
00:28:08.000,00:28:10.320,We just stayed hunkered down.
00:28:12.240,00:28:14.560,I guess we just froze in place.
00:28:15.920,00:28:17.560,Plan to move on?
00:28:20.920,00:28:23.080,Haven't worked up to it yet.
00:28:30.680,00:28:32.640,A lot of it's gone missing.
00:28:33.120,00:28:34.520,Load up.
00:28:39.040,00:28:41.240,You take that one. Nothing fancy.
00:28:41.760,00:28:43.760,The scope's accurate.
00:28:55.800,00:28:57.320,-Duane. -Huh?
00:28:57.440,00:28:59.440,-Take this to the car. -Okay.
00:28:59.840,00:29:01.280,Are you sure you won't come along?
00:29:02.400,00:29:03.560,Few more days.
00:29:12.400,00:29:14.720,I'll turn mine on a few minutes every day at dawn.
00:29:14.800,00:29:17.240,"You get up there, that's how you'll find me."
00:29:17.840,00:29:20.280,-You think ahead. -Can't afford not to.
00:29:20.480,00:29:22.760,"-Not anymore. -MORGAN: Listen, one thing."
00:29:23.320,00:29:29.600,"They may not seem like much one at a time, but in a group, all riled up and hungry, man, you watch your ass."
00:29:29.680,00:29:30.720,"You, too."
00:29:32.960,00:29:36.000,"You're a good man, Rick. I hope you find your wife and son."
00:29:38.880,00:29:40.720,"Be seeing you, Duane."
00:29:40.840,00:29:42.800,"-Take care of your old man. -Yes, sir."
00:29:53.480,00:29:55.120,Leon Basset?
00:29:59.240,00:30:00.840,Didn't think much of him.
00:30:00.920,00:30:02.600,"Careless and dumb, but..."
00:30:04.080,00:30:05.800,Can't leave him like this.
00:30:09.000,00:30:10.400,You know they'll hear the shot.
00:30:10.680,00:30:12.720,Let's not be here when they show up.
00:30:12.800,00:30:14.560,"Let's go, son. Come on."
00:31:14.040,00:31:16.200,Read your comic books awhile.
00:31:16.280,00:31:17.960,Daddy will be upstairs.
00:32:23.040,00:32:24.800,"-Daddy? -It's all right, Duane!"
00:32:25.600,00:32:27.920,"You stay there, son. Don't you come up here."
00:32:35.000,00:32:36.520,I don't know what you'd call it.
00:32:46.000,00:32:47.400,Jenny.
00:32:48.800,00:32:50.440,"Come on, baby."
00:33:07.080,00:33:09.080,I'm sorry this happened to you.
00:33:57.800,00:33:59.480,Come on. Come on.
00:34:38.960,00:34:40.520,RICK: Broadcasting on emergency channel.
00:34:40.960,00:34:43.360,Will be approaching Atlanta on highway 85.
00:34:44.760,00:34:46.400,"Anybody reads, please respond."
00:34:48.560,00:34:50.160,RICK: Can anybody hear my voice?
00:34:50.840,00:34:52.880,-Hey. Hello? -Can you hear my voice?
00:34:52.960,00:34:54.920,"Yes, I can hear you. You're coming through. Over."
00:34:57.960,00:34:59.680,Broadcasting on emergency channel.
00:35:00.160,00:35:02.800,Will be approaching Atlanta on highway 85.
00:35:02.920,00:35:05.440,"If anybody reads, please respond."
00:35:08.200,00:35:09.560,We're just outside the city.
00:35:12.360,00:35:14.120,Hello? Hello?
00:35:16.480,00:35:17.600,Try to raise him again.
00:35:17.880,00:35:20.080,"Come on, son, you know best how to work this thing."
00:35:22.720,00:35:25.440,"Hello, hello. Is the person who called still on the air?"
00:35:28.160,00:35:32.000,"This is Officer Shane Walsh broadcasting to person unknown, please respond."
00:35:36.040,00:35:37.360,He's gone.
00:35:38.840,00:35:41.080,There are others. It's not just us.
00:35:41.440,00:35:43.960,"We knew there would be, right? That's why we left the CB on."
00:35:44.360,00:35:45.760,A lot of good it's been doing.
00:35:45.840,00:35:50.560,-Okay. -LORI: And I've been saying for a week we ought to put signs up on 85 and warn people away from the city.
00:35:50.640,00:35:52.880,Folks got no idea what they're getting into.
00:35:52.960,00:35:54.680,"Well, we haven't had time."
00:35:56.080,00:35:57.440,I think we need to make time.
00:35:58.120,00:35:59.800,And who the hell would you propose we send?
00:35:59.920,00:36:01.800,I'll go. Give me a vehicle.
00:36:01.880,00:36:04.480,Nobody goes anywhere alone. You know that.
00:36:09.400,00:36:10.440,"Yes, sir."
00:36:10.640,00:36:12.400,"Hey, hey, hey. Go on, take a seat, bud."
00:36:12.520,00:36:14.520,You're all right. Go on. You're all right.
00:36:16.840,00:36:18.600,"I'm not putting you in danger, okay?"
00:36:18.680,00:36:20.200,I'm not doing it for anything.
00:36:20.280,00:36:26.920,"That make you feel like sometimes you want to slap me upside the head, tell you what, girl, you feel that need, you go right ahead. I'm right here. Go on."
00:36:29.480,00:36:34.040,"You cannot walk off like that all, and half-cocked."
00:36:34.120,00:36:36.840,"Look, you do not want to do it for my sake or your sake, that's fine."
00:36:36.920,00:36:39.560,But just... You do it for him.
00:36:41.160,00:36:45.520,"That boy has been through too much and he's not losing his mother, too, okay?"
00:36:46.680,00:36:47.720,Okay?
00:36:48.920,00:36:50.200,I'm a good mom.
00:36:53.560,00:36:55.000,You tell me Okay.
00:37:02.040,00:37:04.920,It's not hard. All right.
00:37:06.600,00:37:07.800,Hey.
00:37:17.640,00:37:18.840,CARL: Mom.
00:37:22.560,00:37:24.560,"SHANE: What's up, bud? She's in there."
00:37:24.880,00:37:27.280,"Hey, I don't want you to worry."
00:37:27.480,00:37:29.880,"Your mama's not going anywhere, okay?"
00:37:30.320,00:37:32.040,Yeah? Yeah?
00:37:32.280,00:37:33.520,-Go finish your chores. -Okay.
00:38:02.720,00:38:04.120,Hello?
00:38:05.480,00:38:07.280,Police officer out here.
00:38:09.720,00:38:11.600,Can I borrow some gas?
00:38:23.480,00:38:24.680,Hello?
00:38:25.600,00:38:27.120,Anybody home?
00:39:30.280,00:39:31.560,"Just go easy, okay?"
00:39:32.160,00:39:34.280,I haven't done this for years.
00:39:38.880,00:39:40.080,Easy now.
00:39:40.200,00:39:42.360,"Easy, boy. Easy. Easy."
00:40:47.800,00:40:49.920,There's just a few. Nothing we can't outrun.
00:41:42.400,00:41:43.600,Shoot me now.
00:41:44.800,00:41:45.800,Oh.
00:41:46.200,00:41:47.200,Oh!
00:42:04.560,00:42:06.200,"Oh, God. Oh, God."
00:42:25.320,00:42:27.360,"Lori, Carl, I'm sorry."
00:42:38.760,00:42:40.720,"Oh, God."
00:44:02.320,00:44:03.720,Dumbass.
00:44:05.680,00:44:06.920,"Yeah, you in the tank."
00:44:07.640,00:44:09.120,Cozy in there?
00:00:07.720,00:00:09.240,BOY: Mom!
00:00:11.120,00:00:12.520,Right here.
00:00:25.000,00:00:26.040,Any luck?
00:00:28.320,00:00:30.120,How do we tell if they're poison?
00:00:31.080,00:00:33.840,"Uh, there's only one sure way I know of."
00:00:36.400,00:00:37.920,Ask Shane when he gets back?
00:00:38.000,00:00:39.120,"Yeah, you've got it."
00:00:39.400,00:00:40.480,Thank you.
00:00:43.600,00:00:45.560,"Dale, I'm heading out."
00:00:46.400,00:00:48.440,"Sweetheart, I want you to stay where Dale can see you okay?"
00:00:48.800,00:00:49.920,"Yes, Mom."
00:00:50.680,00:00:52.640,"DALE: You, too. Don't wander too far."
00:00:52.720,00:00:54.000,Stay within shouting distance.
00:00:54.120,00:00:56.360,"And if you see anything, holler. I'll come running."
00:00:57.320,00:00:58.360,"Yes, Mom."
00:02:34.480,00:02:35.840,You scared the hell out of me.
00:02:36.000,00:02:37.760,I bet. That's what you get for keeping me waiting.
00:02:37.960,00:02:39.320,I was trying to be quiet.
00:02:39.960,00:02:43.120,"-Where you been? -Amy the mushroom queen, I had to wait for her to get back."
00:02:50.160,00:02:52.160,-How much time do we have? -Enough.
00:03:43.840,00:03:45.400,-Come here. -Okay.
00:04:50.800,00:04:52.160,"Hello, hello?"
00:04:55.160,00:04:56.600,Where are you? Outside?
00:04:56.800,00:04:57.800,Can you see me right now?
00:05:00.200,00:05:02.440,You're surrounded by walkers. That's the bad news.
00:05:02.800,00:05:04.000,There's good news?
00:05:07.640,00:05:09.840,I don't mind telling you I'm a little concerned in here.
00:05:13.200,00:05:15.200,You'd be having a major freak-out.
00:05:16.360,00:05:18.120,Got any advice for me?
00:05:24.440,00:05:25.760,"That's it, Make a run for it?"
00:05:26.240,00:05:29.320,My way's not as dumb as it sounds. You've got eyes on the outside here.
00:05:29.400,00:05:33.640,There's one geek still up on the tank but the others have climbed down and joined the feeding frenzy where the horse went down.
00:05:33.960,00:05:35.440,-You with me so far? -So far.
00:05:35.520,00:05:37.880,"Okay, the street on the other side of the tank is less crowded."
00:05:38.320,00:05:40.480,"If you move now while they're distracted, you stand a chance."
00:05:41.000,00:05:43.640,-Got ammo? -In that duffel bag I dropped out there.
00:05:43.720,00:05:44.920,"And guns, can I get to it?"
00:05:47.200,00:05:49.120,-What do you have on you? -Hang on.
00:06:06.880,00:06:08.600,"Yeah, yeah."
00:06:10.000,00:06:12.400,I've got a Beretta with one clip.
00:06:12.560,00:06:13.720,Fifteen rounds.
00:06:15.000,00:06:18.000,"Jump off the right side of the tank, keep going in that direction."
00:06:18.080,00:06:21.200,"There's an alley up the street, maybe 50 yards, be there."
00:06:22.520,00:06:24.000,"Hey, what's your name?"
00:06:26.800,00:06:27.800,Right.
00:06:58.000,00:06:59.200,"Whoa, not dead!"
00:06:59.320,00:07:00.520,"Come on, come on!"
00:07:01.360,00:07:02.480,Faster!
00:07:03.600,00:07:05.400,"Come on, come on!"
00:07:10.600,00:07:12.200,What are you doing? Come on!
00:07:24.000,00:07:25.360,"Come on, get up."
00:07:36.840,00:07:38.640,"Nice moves there, Clint Eastwood."
00:07:38.720,00:07:41.840,You the new sheriff? Come riding in to clean up the town?
00:07:41.920,00:07:44.160,"-It wasn't my intention. -Yeah, whatever, yeehaw."
00:07:45.000,00:07:46.560,You're still a dumbass.
00:07:47.920,00:07:49.360,Rick. Thanks.
00:07:51.240,00:07:52.920,Glenn. You're welcome.
00:07:55.080,00:07:56.320,"Oh, no."
00:08:03.400,00:08:04.520,The bright side...
00:08:05.320,00:08:07.400,It'll be the fall that kills us.
00:08:07.480,00:08:08.840,I'm a glass-half-full kind of guy.
00:08:15.800,00:08:17.520,Are you the one that barricaded the alley?
00:08:17.600,00:08:20.040,"Somebody did, I guess when the city got overrun."
00:08:20.120,00:08:22.840,Whoever did it was thinking. Not many geeks get through.
00:08:22.920,00:08:25.520,"Back at the tank, why'd you stick your neck out for me?"
00:08:25.600,00:08:31.080,"Call it foolish, naive hope that if I'm ever that far up shit creek, somebody might do the same for me."
00:08:31.160,00:08:32.840,Guess I'm an even bigger dumbass than you.
00:08:50.080,00:08:52.960,"I'm back, got a guest plus four geeks in the alley."
00:09:08.000,00:09:09.280,Let's go!
00:09:11.760,00:09:13.280,"Morales, let's go!"
00:09:16.560,00:09:18.600,"You son of a bitch, we ought to kill you."
00:09:18.680,00:09:20.000,"Just chill out, Andrea. Back off."
00:09:20.320,00:09:22.600,"-Come on, ease up. -Ease up? You're kidding me, right?"
00:09:22.840,00:09:24.840,We're dead because of this stupid asshole.
00:09:24.920,00:09:28.400,"Andrea, I said back the hell off."
00:09:34.440,00:09:35.960,"Well, pull the trigger."
00:09:39.240,00:09:40.760,"We're dead, all of us..."
00:09:42.360,00:09:43.480,...because of you.
00:09:46.160,00:09:47.560,I don't understand.
00:09:48.120,00:09:50.840,"Look, we came into the city to scavenge supplies."
00:09:51.280,00:09:53.280,You know what the key to scavenging is? Surviving.
00:09:53.600,00:09:56.320,"You know the key to surviving? Sneaking in and out, tiptoeing."
00:09:56.400,00:09:58.240,Not shooting up the streets like it's the O.K. Corral.
00:09:58.360,00:10:01.200,Every geek for miles around heard you popping off rounds.
00:10:01.280,00:10:03.120,You just rang the dinner bell.
00:10:03.200,00:10:04.480,MORALES: Get the picture now?
00:10:11.360,00:10:12.600,"Oh, God."
00:10:18.880,00:10:20.720,What the hell were you doing out there anyway?
00:10:20.800,00:10:22.240,Trying to flag the helicopter.
00:10:22.320,00:10:25.080,"Helicopter? Man, that's crap. There ain't no damn helicopter."
00:10:25.160,00:10:28.200,"You were chasing a hallucination, -imagining things, it happens. -I saw it."
00:10:29.480,00:10:32.240,"Hey, T-dog, try that C.B. Can you contact the others?"
00:10:32.680,00:10:34.480,Others? The refugee center?
00:10:34.640,00:10:37.600,"Yeah, the refugee center, they've got biscuits waiting at the oven for us."
00:10:37.680,00:10:40.320,Got no signal. Maybe the roof.
00:10:42.280,00:10:44.040,"Oh, no, is that Dixon?"
00:10:44.120,00:10:46.320,"-What is that maniac doing? -Come on, let's go."
00:11:08.920,00:11:12.240,Hey! You oughta be more polite to a man with a gun!
00:11:13.040,00:11:14.720,Huh? Ah!
00:11:15.280,00:11:16.520,Only common sense.
00:11:16.600,00:11:18.680,"Man, you wasting bullets we ain't even got, man!"
00:11:18.760,00:11:20.480,And you're bringing even more of them down on our ass.
00:11:20.560,00:11:21.720,"- Man, just chill. -Hey!"
00:11:21.800,00:11:24.400,Bad enough I've got this taco-bender on my ass all day.
00:11:24.480,00:11:26.280,Now I'm gonna take orders from you?
00:11:26.360,00:11:28.720,"I don't think so, bro. That'll be the day."
00:11:29.240,00:11:31.040,That'll be the day?
00:11:31.120,00:11:32.200,You got something you want to tell me?
00:11:32.280,00:11:33.280,"Hey, T-dog man, just leave it."
00:11:33.360,00:11:34.480,"-No. -All right, it ain't worth it."
00:11:35.400,00:11:37.920,"Now Merle, just relax, okay?"
00:11:38.560,00:11:39.640,We've got enough trouble.
00:11:40.080,00:11:41.960,-You want to know the day? -Yeah.
00:11:43.080,00:11:44.800,"I'll tell you the day, Mr. Yo."
00:11:44.880,00:11:46.600,It's the day I take orders from a nigger.
00:11:46.680,00:11:48.200,Mother...
00:11:48.320,00:11:49.320,"Hey, come on, Merle. That's enough."
00:11:49.440,00:11:50.880,-ANDREA: Come on. -Dixon.
00:11:50.960,00:11:52.080,Dixon!
00:11:52.760,00:11:54.280,"Whoa, cut it out, man!"
00:11:54.640,00:11:57.160,"-Stop it, Dixon, get off him! -Come on!"
00:11:57.320,00:11:58.880,"Dixon, you're gonna hurt him."
00:12:01.680,00:12:03.000,"Merle, cut it out!"
00:12:11.640,00:12:13.560,"No, no, no, please, please."
00:12:34.360,00:12:37.240,"We're gonna have ourselves a little powwow, huh?"
00:12:37.920,00:12:40.280,Talk about who's in charge.
00:12:41.520,00:12:43.640,I vote me. Anybody else?
00:12:44.120,00:12:46.400,"Huh, democracy time, y'all."
00:12:46.840,00:12:48.640,"Show of hands, huh?"
00:12:48.960,00:12:51.520,"All in favor, huh?"
00:12:52.560,00:12:54.400,Come on. Let's see 'em.
00:12:54.520,00:12:55.680,"Oh, come on."
00:12:55.880,00:12:56.960,All in favor?
00:12:57.840,00:13:00.280,"Yeah, that's good."
00:13:01.280,00:13:03.600,"Now that means I'm the boss, right?"
00:13:04.680,00:13:06.800,"Yeah, anybody else?"
00:13:07.520,00:13:09.440,"-Hmm, anybody? -RICK: Yeah."
00:13:20.320,00:13:22.680,"-Who the hell are you, man? -Officer Friendly."
00:13:25.160,00:13:27.640,"Look here, Merle, things are different now."
00:13:28.360,00:13:30.720,There are no niggers anymore.
00:13:30.880,00:13:33.840,"No dumb-as-shit, inbred white-trash fools either."
00:13:34.400,00:13:36.360,Only dark meat and white meat.
00:13:36.800,00:13:38.160,There's us and the dead.
00:13:38.480,00:13:40.680,"We survive this by pulling together, not apart."
00:13:41.280,00:13:42.440,"Screw you, man."
00:13:43.880,00:13:46.400,I can see you make a habit of missing the point.
00:13:47.000,00:13:48.680,"Yeah? Well, screw you twice."
00:13:51.120,00:13:52.240,Only common sense.
00:13:55.440,00:13:57.640,"You wouldn't, you're a cop."
00:13:59.640,00:14:03.040,All I am anymore is a man looking for his wife and son.
00:14:04.240,00:14:06.520,Anybody that gets in the way of that is gonna lose.
00:14:08.560,00:14:10.080,I'll give you a moment to think about that.
00:14:20.960,00:14:22.240,Got some on your nose there.
00:14:23.200,00:14:24.360,What are you gonna do?
00:14:26.680,00:14:29.400,"Hey! What are you doing, man? That's my stuff!"
00:14:31.480,00:14:33.320,"If I get loose, you'd better pray..."
00:14:34.000,00:14:35.760,"Yeah, you hear me, you pig?"
00:14:36.320,00:14:38.160,"-You hear me? -Yeah, your voice carries."
00:14:38.240,00:14:40.320,"Do you hear me, you filthy pig?"
00:14:43.360,00:14:44.880,You're not Atlanta P.D.
00:14:45.680,00:14:47.080,Where're you from?
00:14:50.720,00:14:55.640,"Well, Officer Friendly from up the road a ways, welcome to the big city."
00:15:10.680,00:15:12.480,"My God, it's like Times Square down there."
00:15:12.800,00:15:15.160,-How's that signal? -It's like Dixon's brain...
00:15:16.080,00:15:17.080,Weak.
00:15:19.280,00:15:21.240,-MORALES: Keep trying. -Why? There's nothing they can do.
00:15:21.400,00:15:22.480,Not a damn thing.
00:15:23.600,00:15:25.400,Got some people outside the city is all.
00:15:25.480,00:15:27.400,There's no refugee center. That's a pipe dream.
00:15:27.480,00:15:29.160,Then she's right. We're on our own.
00:15:29.240,00:15:30.720,Up to us to find a way out.
00:15:30.800,00:15:31.840,Good luck with that.
00:15:32.120,00:15:35.200,"These streets ain't safe in this part of town, from what I hear."
00:15:36.120,00:15:37.680,"Ain't that right, sugar tits?"
00:15:38.720,00:15:39.920,"Hey, honeybunch."
00:15:40.640,00:15:44.960,"What say you get me out of these cuffs, we go off somewhere and bump some uglies?"
00:15:46.280,00:15:48.480,-Gonna die anyway. -I'd rather.
00:15:50.240,00:15:52.920,"Rug muncher, I figured as much."
00:15:53.240,00:15:54.760,The streets ain't safe.
00:15:55.560,00:15:57.080,Now there's an understatement.
00:15:57.160,00:15:59.640,What about under the streets? The sewers?
00:15:59.720,00:16:00.880,"Oh, man."
00:16:02.000,00:16:03.320,"Hey, Glenn, check the alley."
00:16:03.760,00:16:05.520,You see any manhole covers?
00:16:13.840,00:16:16.760,"No, must be all out on the street where the geeks are."
00:16:16.880,00:16:25.480,"Maybe not, old building like this built in the '20s, big structures often had drainage tunnels into the sewers, in case of flooding -down in the subbasements. -GLENN: How do you know that?"
00:16:25.560,00:16:27.240,It's my job... Was.
00:16:27.760,00:16:29.720,I worked in the City Zoning Office.
00:16:40.920,00:16:42.640,"This is it, are you sure?"
00:16:43.200,00:16:46.120,I really scoped this place out the other times I was here.
00:16:46.200,00:16:48.920,It's the only thing in the building that goes down.
00:16:49.000,00:16:50.760,But I've never gone down it.
00:16:51.720,00:16:53.000,"Who'd want to, right?"
00:16:57.360,00:16:59.240,"Oh, great."
00:17:01.400,00:17:03.920,"-We'll be right behind you. -No, you won't, not you."
00:17:04.000,00:17:05.800,"Why not me, think I can't?"
00:17:06.760,00:17:07.800,I wasn't...
00:17:07.920,00:17:09.040,Speak your mind.
00:17:11.000,00:17:15.160,"Look, until now I always came here by myself."
00:17:15.520,00:17:17.640,"In and out, grab a few things, no problem."
00:17:18.160,00:17:20.360,"The first time I bring a group, everything goes to hell."
00:17:20.760,00:17:21.760,No offense.
00:17:24.120,00:17:26.640,"If you want me to go down this gnarly hole, fine."
00:17:27.840,00:17:29.240,But only if we do it my way.
00:17:29.960,00:17:31.120,It's tight down there.
00:17:31.200,00:17:36.040,"If I run into something and have to get out quick, I don't want you all jammed up behind me getting me killed."
00:17:36.120,00:17:38.960,"I'll take one person, not you either."
00:17:39.920,00:17:41.240,You've got Merle's gun and I've seen you shoot.
00:17:41.600,00:17:45.040,"I'd feel better if you were out in that store watching those doors, covering our ass."
00:17:45.720,00:17:48.120,"You've got the only other gun, so you should go with him."
00:17:48.200,00:17:50.600,You be my wingman. Jacqui stays here.
00:17:50.960,00:17:52.560,"Something happens, yell down to us."
00:17:52.840,00:17:54.320,-Get us back up here in a hurry. -Okay.
00:17:54.680,00:17:57.120,"Okay, everybody knows their jobs."
00:19:01.560,00:19:03.200,Sorry for the gun in your face.
00:19:04.720,00:19:07.000,People do things when they're afraid.
00:19:07.080,00:19:08.920,Not that it was entirely unjustified.
00:19:09.560,00:19:11.440,You did get us into this.
00:19:12.240,00:19:13.880,"If I get us out, would that make up for it?"
00:19:14.280,00:19:16.640,"No, but it'd be a start."
00:19:29.120,00:19:31.200,"Next time, though, take the safety off."
00:19:31.840,00:19:32.960,It won't shoot otherwise.
00:19:35.240,00:19:36.480,-Oh. -Is that your gun?
00:19:37.560,00:19:39.240,"It was a gift, why?"
00:19:43.440,00:19:45.640,Little red dot means it's ready to fire.
00:19:46.120,00:19:47.960,You may have occasion to use it.
00:19:55.600,00:19:56.960,T-DOG: Anybody out there?
00:20:00.560,00:20:02.640,Hello? Anybody read?
00:20:03.240,00:20:06.320,I'm hoping to hear somebody's voice 'cause I'm getting sick and tired of hearing mine.
00:20:06.400,00:20:08.280,"Yeah, well, that makes two of us."
00:20:08.600,00:20:10.400,Why don't you knock that crap off?
00:20:10.480,00:20:12.360,"You're giving me a headache, boy."
00:20:13.320,00:20:14.760,Why don't you pull your head out of your ass?
00:20:14.840,00:20:16.560,Maybe your headache will go away.
00:20:20.440,00:20:21.560,I'll tell you what.
00:20:21.960,00:20:26.080,You get me out of these cuffs and I'll be all Sammy Sunshine positive for you.
00:20:27.480,00:20:30.920,"Hey, see that hacksaw over there in that tool bag?"
00:20:33.040,00:20:36.360,"Get it for me, hmm? Make it worth your while."
00:20:36.960,00:20:38.120,"What do you say, man? Come on."
00:20:39.000,00:20:40.400,Get me out of these things.
00:20:40.480,00:20:42.160,So you can beat my ass again?
00:20:44.200,00:20:46.280,Or call me nigger some more?
00:20:46.360,00:20:48.000,"Come on, now, it wasn't personal."
00:20:48.080,00:20:50.760,It's just that your kind and my kind ain't meant to mix.
00:20:51.720,00:20:52.760,That's all.
00:20:53.200,00:20:59.200,"It don't mean we can't work together, parley, as long as there's some kind of mutual gain involved."
00:21:02.160,00:21:04.760,"So, about that hacksaw..."
00:21:05.280,00:21:10.120,"I guess you want me to get that rifle over there, too so you can shoot that cop when he comes back up, huh?"
00:21:12.960,00:21:14.280,Huh.
00:21:24.080,00:21:26.200,"MORALES: Yeah, we've got ourselves a sewer tunnel."
00:21:27.320,00:21:28.800,Jacqui was right.
00:21:30.120,00:21:31.840,Can we cut through it?
00:21:31.920,00:21:34.680,"MORALES: If we had a blowtorch and half a day, sure."
00:21:35.480,00:21:37.800,Dale's hacksaw sure as hell won't do it.
00:21:51.040,00:21:52.120,Oh.
00:21:58.120,00:21:59.920,See something you like?
00:22:00.000,00:22:02.720,"Not me, but I know someone who would."
00:22:04.600,00:22:05.760,My sister.
00:22:06.840,00:22:09.240,She's still such a kid in some ways.
00:22:09.320,00:22:10.600,"Unicorns, dragons..."
00:22:11.400,00:22:12.560,She's into all that stuff.
00:22:12.640,00:22:14.400,"But mermaids, they rule."
00:22:15.320,00:22:16.560,She loves mermaids.
00:22:17.800,00:22:19.080,Why not take it?
00:22:20.320,00:22:21.720,There's a cop staring at me.
00:22:27.000,00:22:28.160,Would it be considered looting?
00:22:30.760,00:22:33.520,"I don't think those rules apply anymore, do you?"
00:22:50.920,00:22:53.000,-What did you find down there? -Not a way out.
00:22:54.480,00:22:55.680,We need to find a way.
00:22:56.600,00:22:57.880,And soon.
00:23:05.120,00:23:07.840,"That construction site, those trucks, they always keep keys on hand."
00:23:10.440,00:23:12.400,MORALES: You'll never make it past the walkers.
00:23:12.480,00:23:13.920,You got me out of that tank.
00:23:14.000,00:23:15.880,"Yeah, but they were feeding, they were distracted."
00:23:16.080,00:23:17.360,Can we distract them again?
00:23:17.640,00:23:19.640,"Right, listen to him, he's onto something."
00:23:20.160,00:23:22.200,"A diversion, like on Hogan's Heroes."
00:23:22.280,00:23:24.880,"-God, give it a rest. -They're drawn by sound, right?"
00:23:25.640,00:23:27.840,"Right, like dogs, they hear a sound, they come."
00:23:27.920,00:23:28.920,RICK: What else?
00:23:29.000,00:23:30.280,Aside from they hear you?
00:23:30.360,00:23:33.240,"They see you, smell you and if they catch you, they eat you."
00:23:33.320,00:23:35.240,-They can tell us by smell? -Can't you?
00:23:35.840,00:23:38.480,"They smell dead, we don't. It's pretty distinct."
00:23:43.600,00:23:46.320,"If bad ideas were an Olympic event, -this would take the gold. -He's right."
00:23:46.440,00:23:48.600,"Just stop, okay? Take some time to think this through."
00:23:48.680,00:23:51.360,How much time? They already got through one set of doors.
00:23:51.480,00:23:52.840,That glass won't hold forever.
00:24:47.720,00:24:48.720,Wayne Dunlap.
00:24:49.400,00:24:50.480,Georgia license.
00:24:51.600,00:24:54.840,Born 1979.
00:25:04.720,00:25:06.600,And a picture of a pretty girl.
00:25:09.760,00:25:12.160,"With love, from Rachel."
00:25:13.800,00:25:15.080,He used to be like us...
00:25:15.920,00:25:20.120,...worrying about bills or the rent or the super bowl.
00:25:23.360,00:25:26.840,"If I ever find my family, I'm gonna tell them about Wayne."
00:25:34.680,00:25:35.760,GLENN: One more thing.
00:25:37.960,00:25:39.280,He's an organ donor.
00:25:47.360,00:25:49.720,"Oh, God!"
00:25:50.320,00:25:51.400,Ugh!
00:25:51.600,00:25:53.640,"-Oh, God. -ANDREA: Oh."
00:25:57.600,00:25:59.160,"Oh, God."
00:26:09.320,00:26:10.600,Keep chopping.
00:26:14.160,00:26:16.120,I am so gonna hurl.
00:26:16.200,00:26:17.480,Later.
00:26:21.280,00:26:22.440,Oh!
00:26:28.080,00:26:29.320,Everybody got gloves?
00:26:31.560,00:26:33.680,Don't get any on your skin or in your eyes.
00:26:46.600,00:26:48.520,"Oh, God!"
00:26:59.880,00:27:02.440,"Oh, jeez, oh, this is bad."
00:27:02.760,00:27:03.920,This is really bad.
00:27:04.280,00:27:06.640,"Think about something else, puppies and kittens."
00:27:07.640,00:27:08.920,Dead puppies and kittens.
00:27:12.600,00:27:14.560,That is just evil. What is wrong with you?
00:27:14.920,00:27:17.200,Next time let the cracker beat his ass.
00:27:18.200,00:27:20.120,"-I'm sorry, yo. -You suck."
00:27:24.120,00:27:26.680,"-Do we smell like them? -Oh, yeah."
00:27:28.400,00:27:29.480,Glenn.
00:27:32.000,00:27:33.040,Just in case.
00:27:41.000,00:27:42.200,"If we make it back, be ready."
00:27:42.640,00:27:44.040,What about Merle Dixon?
00:27:57.160,00:27:58.280,Give me the ax.
00:28:00.480,00:28:03.520,"-We need, we need more guts. -Oh, God!"
00:29:50.480,00:29:52.840,"-Hey, what's happening, man? -Hey, T-dog, try that C.B."
00:29:53.920,00:29:55.520,"Hey, come on, talk to me, y'all."
00:29:56.000,00:29:58.400,"Base camp, this is T-dog. Anybody hear me?"
00:29:59.120,00:30:01.000,Can anybody out there hear me?
00:30:05.600,00:30:08.080,That asshole is out on the street with the handcuff keys?
00:30:19.440,00:30:22.240,"Boy, that hose isn't long for this world, is it?"
00:30:23.280,00:30:24.480,"No, sir."
00:30:25.400,00:30:27.760,Where the hell are we gonna find a replacement?
00:30:29.080,00:30:31.280,It's late. They should've been back by now.
00:30:31.400,00:30:33.600,Worrying won't make it better.
00:30:38.880,00:30:40.800,SHANE: Attaboy. CARL: Yeah.
00:30:40.960,00:30:42.920,"SHANE: And three, two, one pull it."
00:30:46.360,00:30:47.640,Start it over.
00:30:49.840,00:30:51.880,"Make your P, other way, around your finger."
00:30:51.960,00:30:53.000,Oops.
00:30:53.200,00:30:55.760,"Good, just tie it, like, around your finger."
00:30:55.840,00:30:57.120,Attaboy.
00:30:57.680,00:30:59.520,"T-DOG: Hello, base camp!"
00:31:00.760,00:31:03.160,Can anybody out there hear me?
00:31:06.880,00:31:09.480,"Base camp, this is T-Dog. Anybody hear me?"
00:31:10.480,00:31:11.640,"Hello, hello?"
00:31:11.880,00:31:13.720,"Reception's bad on this end. Repeat, repeat."
00:31:13.800,00:31:14.920,"Shane, is that you?"
00:31:16.320,00:31:17.400,Is that them?
00:31:19.760,00:31:20.920,We're trapped in the department store.
00:31:23.320,00:31:25.400,-He say they're trapped? - There are geeks all over the place.
00:31:25.480,00:31:27.080,Hundreds of 'em. We're surrounded.
00:31:28.000,00:31:29.960,"T-dog, repeat that last, repeat."
00:31:37.640,00:31:39.000,He said the department store.
00:31:39.080,00:31:40.200,"DALE: I heard it, too."
00:31:42.480,00:31:43.720,-LORI: Shane? -No way.
00:31:44.240,00:31:45.520,We do not go after them.
00:31:45.800,00:31:47.120,We do not risk the rest of the group.
00:31:47.320,00:31:49.920,-Y'all know that. -So we're just gonna leave her there?
00:31:50.560,00:31:53.240,"Look, Amy, I know that this is not easy."
00:31:53.440,00:31:56.560,She volunteered to go to help the rest of us.
00:31:56.640,00:31:58.600,"I know, and she knew the risks, right?"
00:32:00.000,00:32:01.800,"See, if she's trapped, she's gone."
00:32:03.440,00:32:04.880,So we just have to deal with that.
00:32:06.440,00:32:07.880,There's nothing we can do.
00:32:09.320,00:32:11.360,"She's my sister, you son of a bitch."
00:32:25.080,00:32:26.440,LORI: Amy.
00:32:28.400,00:32:30.280,"Come on. It's all right, buddy."
00:33:58.880,00:34:00.240,"Oh, man."
00:34:16.080,00:34:17.200,It's just a cloudburst.
00:34:17.480,00:34:19.360,We get 'em all the time. It'll pass real quick.
00:34:49.160,00:34:51.120,"The smells washing off, isn't it?"
00:34:51.640,00:34:53.120,"-Is it washing off? -No, it's not."
00:34:56.920,00:34:58.480,"Well, maybe."
00:35:16.360,00:35:17.560,"Come on, come on, come on, come on."
00:35:46.760,00:35:47.960,Rick!
00:36:03.560,00:36:04.880,"Go, go, go, go!"
00:36:25.840,00:36:27.760,"-They're leaving us. -DIXON: What, what?"
00:36:27.880,00:36:29.520,"-Where they going? Where they going? -No, no, come back."
00:36:34.640,00:36:36.800,"Oh, God, oh God. They're all over that place."
00:36:36.880,00:36:37.960,You need to draw them away.
00:36:38.080,00:36:39.760,Those roll-up doors at the front of the store...
00:36:39.880,00:36:41.320,"That area, that's what I need cleared."
00:36:41.440,00:36:44.240,"Raise your friends, tell them to get down there and be ready."
00:36:44.360,00:36:46.800,"And I'm drawing the geeks away how? I, I missed that part."
00:36:47.080,00:36:48.280,Noise.
00:37:20.000,00:37:23.160,"Those roll-up doors at the front of the store facing the street, meet us there and be ready."
00:37:37.960,00:37:40.320,"-Come on, let's go, let's go! -Hey, you can't leave me here!"
00:37:40.440,00:37:42.040,"I'm not fooling, man, Morales!"
00:37:42.440,00:37:44.400,"-Hey, man, don't do this! -Come on!"
00:37:44.640,00:37:46.240,"DIXON: Hey, that's my gun, man, you can't leave me."
00:37:46.720,00:37:48.920,"-Don't leave me here, you guys. -Morales, come on!"
00:37:49.000,00:37:50.920,"I'm coming, we've got to go!"
00:37:51.000,00:37:52.920,"DIXON: Morales, you can't leave me like this, man!"
00:37:53.000,00:37:55.160,"Hey, T-dog, no, man, you can't leave me, man."
00:37:55.240,00:37:56.320,"You can't leave me here, not like this."
00:37:56.720,00:37:58.080,"You can't, man, it's not human."
00:38:00.920,00:38:02.440,"Come on, T, come on!"
00:38:02.560,00:38:04.720,"Come on, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
00:38:04.800,00:38:06.120,"Come on, come on, that's it!"
00:38:06.200,00:38:07.600,"Yes, come on, baby!"
00:38:20.360,00:38:21.440,Go.
00:38:24.120,00:38:26.600,"Son of a bitch, you, you did that on purpose!"
00:38:26.680,00:38:28.760,-I didn't mean to! -You lie! You did it on purpose!
00:38:28.920,00:38:31.440,"-It was an accident! -Don't leave me, man!"
00:38:35.360,00:38:37.120,"-You liar! -I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry."
00:38:37.360,00:38:39.680,-Don't leave me! -I'm sorry.
00:38:39.760,00:38:41.400,Don't do this!
00:38:41.480,00:38:42.800,Damn you all!
00:38:42.880,00:38:46.080,"Don't leave me, man! Don't leave, don't leave me!"
00:38:46.160,00:38:47.320,Ah!
00:38:48.600,00:38:50.640,"Hey, what are you doing, man?"
00:38:50.720,00:38:52.560,You're gonna rot in hell!
00:38:52.640,00:38:54.120,You're gonna rot in hell!
00:38:54.240,00:38:56.440,"-Come back, man! -Wait a minute!"
00:38:56.760,00:38:58.480,"Here I come, don't leave me!"
00:38:59.320,00:39:00.480,Don't leave!
00:39:01.880,00:39:03.680,"Okay, okay."
00:39:04.480,00:39:05.720,I got it.
00:39:27.760,00:39:29.320,"Come on, come on."
00:39:29.400,00:39:32.000,"Get closer, get closer. Come on, come on!"
00:40:07.640,00:40:09.000,"Hey, wait for me!"
00:40:20.120,00:40:22.520,"They're here, let's go! Let's go! They're in here!"
00:40:24.400,00:40:26.480,-Let's go! -Open the door!
00:40:29.000,00:40:31.040,-We've got to go! -Go!
00:40:38.920,00:40:40.280,I'm in!
00:40:55.680,00:40:58.720,You'll die! Go to hell! Damn you!
00:41:02.600,00:41:04.120,You're gonna rot in hell!
00:41:27.200,00:41:28.960,I dropped the damn key.
00:41:38.520,00:41:39.680,Where's Glenn?
00:00:03.920,00:00:06.200,"MERLE: That's right. You heard me, bitch."
00:00:07.200,00:00:13.000,"You got a problem? Bring it on if you're man enough, or take it up the chain if you're a pussy."
00:00:14.080,00:00:17.760,"You heard me, you pussy-ass noncom bitch."
00:00:17.840,00:00:19.000,You ain't deaf.
00:00:19.400,00:00:26.000,Take it up the damn chain of command or you can kiss my lily-white ass.
00:00:28.000,00:00:30.360,That's what I said. You heard me.
00:00:30.440,00:00:44.000,"And then this idiot, he takes a swing, Oh, you should've seen the look on his face when I punched out his front teeth."
00:00:45.880,00:00:47.520,"Yeah, five of 'em."
00:00:47.840,00:00:50.480,Pow! Pow! Just like that.
00:00:53.120,00:00:54.440,"Oh, God."
00:00:54.880,00:00:57.880,Sixteen months in the stockade...
00:00:57.960,00:01:00.520,"Oh, that's what them teeth cost me."
00:01:03.120,00:01:04.360,That was...
00:01:05.480,00:01:16.160,"That was hard time, but by God, it was worth every minute of it just to see that prick spit his teeth out on the ground."
00:01:19.280,00:01:22.040,"Yes, sir, worth every minute."
00:01:44.760,00:01:45.760,"Oh, no."
00:01:45.840,00:01:48.520,"No, no! No, no! No, no!"
00:01:52.880,00:01:54.480,God!
00:01:54.560,00:01:56.360,"No, no, merciful Christ!"
00:01:56.440,00:01:57.800,"No, no! No, no!"
00:01:57.880,00:02:00.040,"God, help me! God!"
00:02:00.120,00:02:03.080,"God! Jesus, please!"
00:02:03.160,00:02:06.120,"Jesus, please! Help me! Come on now!"
00:02:06.920,00:02:08.200,Help me!
00:02:17.200,00:02:21.240,"Oh, no, no. Shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:02:31.800,00:02:32.880,Please.
00:02:32.960,00:02:34.840,"I didn't behave, I know."
00:02:35.480,00:02:37.280,I know I'm being punished.
00:02:37.360,00:02:39.160,I know. I...
00:02:39.240,00:02:41.760,"Oh, I deserve it. I deserve it."
00:02:41.840,00:02:42.880,I've been bad.
00:02:46.280,00:02:48.120,Help me now. Show me the way.
00:02:48.200,00:02:50.160,"Go on, tell me what to do."
00:03:07.120,00:03:08.480,That's okay.
00:03:09.800,00:03:12.280,"MERLE: Never you mind, silly Christ boy."
00:03:12.600,00:03:14.480,I ain't begged you before.
00:03:14.560,00:03:17.000,I ain't gonna start begging now.
00:03:17.080,00:03:19.160,I ain't gonna beg you now!
00:03:20.120,00:03:23.440,Don't you worry about me begging you ever!
00:03:23.520,00:03:25.200,I'll never beg you!
00:03:25.640,00:03:27.280,I ain't gonna beg you!
00:03:27.720,00:03:29.600,I never begged you before.
00:04:17.200,00:04:20.560,Best not to dwell on it. Merle got left behind.
00:04:23.280,00:04:25.520,Nobody's gonna be sad he didn't come back...
00:04:27.560,00:04:28.840,Except maybe Daryl.
00:04:29.600,00:04:31.720,-Daryl? -His brother.
00:04:38.680,00:04:40.400,GLENN: Whoo-hoo!
00:04:44.160,00:04:46.040,At least somebody's having a good day.
00:04:49.080,00:04:51.120,GIRL: Give it back. BOY: Stop it.
00:04:51.720,00:04:55.480,GIRL: No. BOY: I found it.
00:04:55.680,00:04:56.760,GIRL: No! BOY: Give it.
00:04:56.920,00:04:59.440,"Mijo, leave your sister alone."
00:04:59.800,00:05:01.080,MIJO: Why? WOMAN: Come on.
00:05:01.160,00:05:04.160,"Baby, the more you fidget, the longer it takes. So don't, okay?"
00:05:04.520,00:05:07.000,"-I'm trying. -Well, try harder."
00:05:07.080,00:05:09.640,"SHANE: If you think this is bad, wait till you start shaving."
00:05:10.560,00:05:12.000,That stings.
00:05:12.440,00:05:16.160,"That day comes, you'll be wishing for one of your mama's haircuts."
00:05:18.320,00:05:24.080,"I'll tell you what, you just get through this with some manly dignity and tomorrow I'll teach you something special."
00:05:25.360,00:05:27.720,I will teach you to catch frogs.
00:05:27.800,00:05:30.760,-I've caught a frog before. -I said frogs. Plural.
00:05:31.280,00:05:33.840,"And it is an art, my friend. It is not to be taken lightly."
00:05:34.320,00:05:38.040,There are ways and means few people know about and...
00:05:38.760,00:05:40.440,I'm willing to share my secrets.
00:05:42.480,00:05:44.160,"Oh, I'm a girl. You talk to him."
00:05:48.720,00:05:51.720,"-Why do we need frogs, plural? -LORI: Hmm?"
00:05:52.120,00:05:54.440,-You ever eat a frog's legs? -Ew!
00:05:54.520,00:05:56.840,"-No, yum! -No, he's right. Ew!"
00:05:59.520,00:06:01.080,"you're gonna be loving those frog legs, lady."
00:06:01.160,00:06:04.600,"I can see it now, Shane, do you think I could have a second helping, please?"
00:06:04.680,00:06:07.080,"-Please? Just one? -Yeah, I doubt that."
00:06:09.400,00:06:13.560,"You and me, we'll be heroes. We'll feed these folks Cajun-style Kermit legs."
00:06:13.880,00:06:14.960,I would rather eat Miss Piggy.
00:06:21.280,00:06:23.040,"You and me, Shane and Carl."
00:06:24.960,00:06:27.080,"MAN: Hey, Dale, can you see what that is?"
00:06:27.800,00:06:28.920,"SHANE: Talk to me, Dale!"
00:06:30.280,00:06:31.400,Can't tell yet.
00:06:36.720,00:06:38.760,Is it them? Are they back?
00:06:41.920,00:06:43.280,DALE: I'll be damned.
00:06:43.360,00:06:46.200,-AMY: What is it? -A stolen car is my guess.
00:06:58.560,00:07:01.600,-Holy crap. Turn that damn thing off! -I don't know how!
00:07:01.840,00:07:03.280,"-Pop the hood, please. -My sister Andrea..."
00:07:03.360,00:07:05.880,"Would you pop the damn hood, please? Pop the damn hood, please!"
00:07:05.960,00:07:07.880,"-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Okay! -Is she okay? Is she all right?"
00:07:07.960,00:07:10.920,-She's okay! She's okay! -Is she coming back?
00:07:11.000,00:07:12.560,GLENN: Yes! AMY: Why isn't she with you?
00:07:12.640,00:07:14.720,-Where is she? She's okay? -GLENN: Yes!
00:07:15.520,00:07:17.200,"Yeah, fine. Everybody is."
00:07:18.920,00:07:20.440,"Well, Merle not so much."
00:07:20.520,00:07:22.480,"Are you crazy, driving this wailing bastard up here?"
00:07:22.560,00:07:24.040,Are you trying to draw every walker for miles?
00:07:24.320,00:07:26.920,-I think we're okay. -You call being stupid okay?
00:07:27.000,00:07:28.600,"DALE: Well, the alarm was echoing all over these hills."
00:07:28.680,00:07:30.360,Hard to pinpoint the source.
00:07:31.400,00:07:33.120,I'm not arguing. I'm just saying.
00:07:33.200,00:07:36.680,"It wouldn't hurt you to think things through a little more carefully next time, would it?"
00:07:37.960,00:07:39.240,Sorry.
00:07:54.560,00:07:55.800,Come meet everybody.
00:08:08.880,00:08:10.880,"-Oh! -Oh, my God!"
00:08:12.840,00:08:14.640,You scared the shit out of me.
00:08:15.680,00:08:17.160,BOY 1: Papi! BOY 2: Daddy!
00:08:17.240,00:08:19.000,-BOY 1: Papi! -MORALES: Hey.
00:08:19.640,00:08:21.000,"Come here, sweetie."
00:08:23.240,00:08:24.440,"Told you I'd be back, didn't I?"
00:08:33.920,00:08:35.400,DALE: You are a welcome sight.
00:08:36.680,00:08:39.080,I thought we had lost you folks for sure.
00:08:39.840,00:08:41.840,"How'd y'all get out of there, anyway?"
00:08:41.920,00:08:44.480,-New guy... He got us out. -SHANE: New guy?
00:08:44.560,00:08:46.720,"MORALES: Yeah, crazy vato just got into town."
00:08:52.440,00:08:54.200,MORALES: The guy's a cop like you.
00:09:16.880,00:09:18.320,Dad! Dad!
00:09:43.920,00:09:45.200,RICK: Oh!
00:10:01.320,00:10:02.720,RICK: Disoriented.
00:10:03.440,00:10:05.120,I guess that comes closest.
00:10:05.960,00:10:07.280,Disoriented.
00:10:09.440,00:10:11.480,"Fear, confusion, all those things but..."
00:10:13.720,00:10:15.120,Disoriented comes closest.
00:10:16.360,00:10:18.440,Words can be meager things.
00:10:19.360,00:10:21.360,Sometimes they fall short.
00:10:21.440,00:10:24.840,RICK: I felt like I'd been ripped out of my life and put somewhere else.
00:10:27.160,00:10:34.240,"For a while I thought I was trapped in some coma dream, something I might not wake up from ever."
00:10:36.680,00:10:38.000,Mom said you died.
00:10:42.320,00:10:44.160,She had every reason to believe that.
00:10:45.280,00:10:46.720,Don't you ever doubt it.
00:10:49.400,00:10:59.680,"LORI: When things started to get really bad, they told me at the hospital that they were gonna medevac you and the other patients to Atlanta, and it never happened."
00:11:00.160,00:11:02.600,"Well, I'm not surprised after Atlanta fell."
00:11:02.680,00:11:03.920,LORI: Yeah.
00:11:04.000,00:11:06.960,"And from the look of that hospital, it got overrun."
00:11:07.040,00:11:12.800,"Yeah, looks don't deceive. I barely got them out, you know?"
00:11:12.880,00:11:15.360,"I can't tell you how grateful I am to you, Shane."
00:11:16.800,00:11:18.320,RICK: I can't begin to express it.
00:11:20.760,00:11:22.880,There go those words falling short again.
00:11:23.440,00:11:24.840,Paltry things.
00:11:34.240,00:11:37.360,"Hey, Ed, you want to rethink that log?"
00:11:37.440,00:11:38.600,"It's cold, man."
00:11:42.920,00:11:44.640,"The cold don't change the rules, does it?"
00:11:46.200,00:11:49.760,"Keep our fires low, just embers, so we can't be seen from a distance, right?"
00:11:49.840,00:11:51.440,I said it's cold.
00:11:51.520,00:11:53.040,You should mind your own business for once.
00:12:00.800,00:12:01.960,"Hey, Ed..."
00:12:04.520,00:12:06.400,"Sure you want to have this conversation, man?"
00:12:09.880,00:12:13.520,Go on. Pull the damn thing out. Go on!
00:12:17.120,00:12:18.400,Christ.
00:12:33.360,00:12:35.880,"Hey, Carol, Sophia, how are y'all this evening?"
00:12:35.960,00:12:38.240,-Fine. We're just fine. -SHANE: Okay.
00:12:39.800,00:12:42.800,"-I'm sorry about the fire. -SHANE: No, no, no. No apology needed."
00:12:44.840,00:12:45.880,"Y'all have a good night, okay?"
00:12:46.760,00:12:48.040,Thank you.
00:12:48.840,00:12:50.480,I appreciate the cooperation.
00:13:00.480,00:13:02.560,DALE: Have you given any thought to Daryl Dixon?
00:13:03.200,00:13:05.960,He won't be happy to hear his brother was left behind.
00:13:06.040,00:13:08.480,I'll tell him. I dropped the key. It's on me.
00:13:08.560,00:13:10.480,I cuffed him. That makes it mine.
00:13:10.560,00:13:11.880,"GLENN: Guys, it's not a competition."
00:13:11.960,00:13:15.800,"I don't mean to bring race into this, but it might sound better coming from a white guy."
00:13:18.480,00:13:19.920,I did what I did.
00:13:21.000,00:13:22.240,"Hell, if I'm gonna hide from him."
00:13:22.320,00:13:25.280,-We could lie. -Or tell the truth.
00:13:26.160,00:13:27.840,Merle was out of control.
00:13:27.920,00:13:30.680,Something had to be done or he'd have gotten us killed.
00:13:31.600,00:13:33.320,Your husband did what was necessary.
00:13:33.760,00:13:37.240,"And if Merle got left behind, it is nobody's fault but Merle's."
00:13:37.320,00:13:39.320,And that's what we tell Daryl?
00:13:41.640,00:13:45.200,"I don't see a rational discussion to be had from that, do you?"
00:13:48.840,00:13:50.280,Word to the wise...
00:13:51.160,00:13:53.840,We're gonna have our hands full when he gets back from his hunt.
00:13:56.200,00:13:58.480,T-DOG: I was scared and I ran.
00:13:59.280,00:14:00.600,I'm not ashamed of it.
00:14:00.680,00:14:03.760,We were all scared. We all ran. What's your point?
00:14:03.840,00:14:05.960,I stopped long enough to chain that door.
00:14:08.080,00:14:09.320,Staircase is narrow.
00:14:09.760,00:14:13.640,Maybe half a dozen geeks can squeeze against it at any one time.
00:14:13.720,00:14:16.040,It's not enough to break through that...
00:14:16.120,00:14:18.480,"Not that chain, not that padlock."
00:14:20.640,00:14:26.600,"My point, Dixon's alive and he's still up there, handcuffed on that roof."
00:14:28.560,00:14:29.760,That's on us.
00:14:42.680,00:14:44.960,"I found you, didn't I?"
00:14:47.640,00:14:48.840,"I love you, Dad."
00:14:51.920,00:14:53.200,"I love you, Carl."
00:15:31.600,00:15:33.080,I found you both.
00:15:34.200,00:15:35.360,Yeah.
00:15:39.680,00:15:41.200,I knew I would.
00:15:42.520,00:15:45.040,"You're getting cocky now, a little bit."
00:15:45.560,00:15:47.160,"No, no, I knew."
00:15:49.360,00:15:54.120,"Walking into our home, finding an empty house, -both of you gone. -I'm so sorry."
00:15:54.200,00:15:57.040,I knew you were alive.
00:15:59.240,00:16:00.360,How?
00:16:02.960,00:16:07.120,"The photos were gone, all our family albums."
00:16:29.680,00:16:30.960,I told you so.
00:16:31.880,00:16:33.800,"Now you're getting cocky, huh?"
00:16:33.880,00:16:35.280,A lot.
00:16:48.480,00:16:50.000,It belongs in here.
00:16:56.520,00:16:59.120,"Baby, I really thought I would never see you again."
00:17:03.560,00:17:05.080,I'm so sorry...
00:17:06.720,00:17:08.120,For everything.
00:17:11.160,00:17:12.640,I feel like...
00:17:12.720,00:17:14.880,"When you were in the hospital, I just..."
00:17:15.320,00:17:17.240,I wanted to take it all back...
00:17:17.320,00:17:19.360,The anger and the bad times.
00:17:19.440,00:17:21.080,But the mistakes...
00:17:25.200,00:17:26.880,Maybe we got a second chance.
00:17:27.800,00:17:29.200,Not many people get that.
00:17:46.280,00:17:47.720,I wondered where that went.
00:17:49.800,00:17:50.960,Do you want it back?
00:17:53.880,00:17:55.360,Of course.
00:18:39.520,00:18:40.760,He won't wake up.
00:19:42.400,00:19:44.040,-Morning. -MAN: Morning.
00:19:45.560,00:19:46.760,-Hey. -Hi.
00:19:49.240,00:19:50.920,-CAROL: Morning. -Morning.
00:19:51.000,00:19:52.280,They're still a little damp.
00:19:52.360,00:19:53.880,The sun'll have 'em dry in no time.
00:19:53.960,00:19:56.720,"-You washed my clothes? -Well, best we could."
00:19:56.800,00:19:59.920,Scrubbing on a washboard ain't half as good as my old Maytag back home.
00:20:00.280,00:20:01.680,That's very kind. Thank you.
00:20:08.480,00:20:10.040,Vultures.
00:20:10.120,00:20:11.680,"Yeah, go on, strip it clean."
00:20:11.760,00:20:13.520,Generators need every drop of fuel they can get.
00:20:13.600,00:20:16.200,"Got no power without it. Sorry, Glenn."
00:20:17.760,00:20:20.200,Thought I'd get to drive it at least a few more days.
00:20:20.280,00:20:22.680,Maybe we'll get to steal another one someday.
00:20:27.840,00:20:29.160,"Morning, Officer."
00:20:30.000,00:20:31.040,Hey.
00:20:35.880,00:20:37.400,You sleep okay?
00:20:38.280,00:20:40.000,Better than in a long time.
00:20:42.400,00:20:45.200,"Well, I didn't want to wake you. I figured you could use it."
00:20:48.480,00:20:50.080,-God. What? -I've been thinking...
00:20:51.000,00:20:52.560,About the man we left behind.
00:20:56.440,00:20:57.640,You're not serious.
00:21:06.560,00:21:07.680,"Water's here, y'all."
00:21:07.760,00:21:09.760,Just a reminder to boil before use.
00:21:17.080,00:21:18.560,Are you asking me or telling me?
00:21:20.000,00:21:22.120,"-Asking. -Well, I think it's crazy."
00:21:22.200,00:21:26.760,"I mean, I think it is just the stupidest way CARL: Mom! LORI: Carl?"
00:21:26.840,00:21:27.960,MAN: It's over there!
00:21:28.040,00:21:29.360,-CARL: Dad! -LORI: Baby!
00:21:29.440,00:21:31.360,GIRL: Momma! Mommy! GLENN: Rick!
00:21:31.440,00:21:32.640,"MAN: Over here, boy! Come on, come on!"
00:21:32.720,00:21:36.320,LORI: Carl! Carl! Baby!
00:21:36.880,00:21:38.920,-Mommy! -You're okay! I've got him. I've got him.
00:21:39.000,00:21:41.440,"-Nothing bit you? Nothing scratched you? -No, I'm okay."
00:22:37.040,00:22:39.240,It's the first one we've had up here.
00:22:39.320,00:22:41.240,They never come this far up the mountain.
00:22:41.320,00:22:43.880,"Well, they're running out of food in the city, that's what."
00:23:05.040,00:23:08.560,"DALE: Oh, Jesus. DARYL: Son of a bitch."
00:23:10.520,00:23:11.920,That's my deer!
00:23:14.000,00:23:20.720,"Look at it. All gnawed on by this filthy, disease-bearing, motherless poxy bastard!"
00:23:20.800,00:23:22.480,"Calm down, son. That's not helping."
00:23:22.560,00:23:23.840,"What do you know about it, old man?"
00:23:27.960,00:23:29.880,I've been tracking this deer for miles.
00:23:30.320,00:23:33.800,"Gonna drag it back to camp, cook us up some venison."
00:23:33.880,00:23:35.000,What do you think?
00:23:35.080,00:23:37.760,Do you think we can cut around this chewed up part right here?
00:23:37.840,00:23:39.400,I would not risk that.
00:23:42.360,00:23:43.880,"I got some squirrel, about a dozen or so."
00:23:45.120,00:23:46.520,That'll have to do.
00:23:51.400,00:23:52.680,"Oh, God."
00:23:54.360,00:23:56.000,"Come on, people. What the hell?"
00:24:03.520,00:24:04.840,It's gotta be the brain.
00:24:06.520,00:24:08.120,Don't y'all know nothing?
00:24:15.520,00:24:16.680,Merle!
00:24:18.960,00:24:21.960,Merle! Get your ugly ass out here!
00:24:23.080,00:24:24.520,I got us some squirrel!
00:24:25.560,00:24:27.120,Let's stew 'em up.
00:24:27.680,00:24:31.200,"SHANE: Daryl, just slow up a bit. I need to talk to you."
00:24:33.920,00:24:35.040,About what?
00:24:36.760,00:24:38.800,-About Merle. -There was a...
00:24:39.680,00:24:41.360,There was a problem in Atlanta.
00:24:52.840,00:24:54.200,SHANE: We're not sure.
00:24:54.840,00:24:56.520,He either is or he ain't!
00:24:56.600,00:24:58.880,"No easy way to say this, so I'll just say it."
00:24:59.760,00:25:01.680,-Who are you? -Rick Grimes.
00:25:02.360,00:25:05.320,"Rick Grimes, you got something you want to tell me?"
00:25:05.400,00:25:10.120,"Your brother was a danger to us all, so I handcuffed him on a roof, hooked him to a piece of metal."
00:25:10.920,00:25:12.240,He's still there.
00:25:13.240,00:25:15.480,Hold on. Let me process this.
00:25:16.720,00:25:20.400,You're saying you handcuffed my brother to a roof and you left him there?
00:25:21.240,00:25:22.280,Yeah.
00:25:29.360,00:25:30.760,T-DOG: Watch the knife!
00:25:35.440,00:25:37.320,SHANE: Okay. Okay.
00:25:37.400,00:25:38.600,DARYL: You'd best let me go!
00:25:38.680,00:25:40.640,"Nah, I think it's better if I don't."
00:25:42.640,00:25:44.080,SHANE: You can file a complaint.
00:25:44.160,00:25:46.080,"Come on, man. We'll keep this up all day."
00:25:47.200,00:25:49.880,I'd like to have a calm discussion on this topic.
00:25:49.960,00:25:51.920,Do you think we can manage that?
00:25:52.000,00:25:53.920,Do you think we can manage that?
00:26:00.640,00:26:02.320,What I did was not on a whim.
00:26:03.440,00:26:06.760,Your brother does not work and play well with others.
00:26:10.680,00:26:12.800,-I dropped it. -You couldn't pick it up?
00:26:13.360,00:26:14.960,"Well, I dropped it in a drain."
00:26:23.040,00:26:24.880,"If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't."
00:26:25.480,00:26:26.520,T-DOG: Maybe this will.
00:26:26.840,00:26:30.040,"Look, I chained the door to the roof so the geeks couldn't get at him..."
00:26:30.120,00:26:33.320,-With a padlock. -It's gotta count for something.
00:26:39.480,00:26:44.760,Hell with all y'all! Just tell me where he is so that I can go get him.
00:26:45.560,00:26:47.040,LORI: He'll show you.
00:26:47.920,00:26:49.160,Isn't that right?
00:26:55.680,00:26:57.160,I'm going back.
00:27:11.240,00:27:12.680,"So that's it, huh?"
00:27:12.760,00:27:14.280,You're just gonna walk off?
00:27:14.360,00:27:16.040,Just to hell with everybody else?
00:27:16.120,00:27:18.040,I'm not saying to hell with anybody...
00:27:18.120,00:27:20.240,"Not you, Shane, Lori least of all."
00:27:21.000,00:27:22.360,SHANE: Tell her that.
00:27:23.880,00:27:25.280,She knows.
00:27:26.760,00:27:27.960,"Well, look, I..."
00:27:28.040,00:27:30.120,"I don't, okay, Rick? So could you just..."
00:27:30.200,00:27:31.920,"Could you throw me a bone here, man?"
00:27:32.000,00:27:33.480,Could you just tell me why?
00:27:33.560,00:27:35.800,Why would you risk your life for a douche bag like Merle Dixon?
00:27:35.880,00:27:38.400,"-Hey, choose your words more carefully. -No, I did."
00:27:38.480,00:27:41.240,Douche bag's what I meant. Merle Dixon...
00:27:41.760,00:27:44.120,The guy wouldn't give you a glass of water if you were dying of thirst.
00:27:44.200,00:27:46.000,What he would or wouldn't do doesn't interest me.
00:27:46.080,00:27:48.440,I can't let a man die of thirst... Me.
00:27:48.520,00:27:50.320,Thirst and exposure.
00:27:51.240,00:27:53.040,We left him like an animal caught in a trap.
00:27:53.120,00:27:55.160,"That's no way for anything to die, let alone a human being."
00:27:57.400,00:28:00.240,"So you and Daryl, that's your big plan?"
00:28:04.120,00:28:05.400,"Oh, come on."
00:28:05.880,00:28:07.880,You know the way. You've been there before...
00:28:07.960,00:28:09.880,"In and out, no problem. You said so yourself."
00:28:11.680,00:28:14.880,"It's not fair of me to ask, I know that, but I'd feel a lot better with you along."
00:28:14.960,00:28:16.360,"I know she would, too."
00:28:17.760,00:28:19.880,"That's just great. Now you're gonna risk three men, huh?"
00:28:22.200,00:28:24.200,"My day just gets better and better, don't it?"
00:28:24.680,00:28:28.160,T-DOG: You see anybody else here stepping up to save your brother's cracker ass?
00:28:28.240,00:28:29.560,Why you?
00:28:29.640,00:28:30.840,T-DOG: You wouldn't even begin to understand.
00:28:31.560,00:28:33.760,-You don't speak my language. -That's four.
00:28:33.840,00:28:37.040,It's not just four. You're putting every single one of us at risk.
00:28:37.120,00:28:39.400,"Just know that, Rick. Come on, you saw that walker."
00:28:39.480,00:28:41.160,It was here. It was in camp.
00:28:41.240,00:28:42.400,They're moving out of the cities.
00:28:42.480,00:28:44.360,"They come back, we need every able body we've got."
00:28:44.440,00:28:46.200,We need 'em here. We need 'em to protect camp.
00:28:46.280,00:28:53.160,"It seems to me what you really need most here -are more guns. -Right, the guns."
00:28:53.240,00:28:54.360,"Wait, what guns?"
00:28:54.440,00:28:57.880,"Six shotguns, two high-powered rifles, over a dozen handguns."
00:28:57.960,00:29:00.360,I cleaned out the cage back at the station before I left.
00:29:00.960,00:29:03.120,I dropped the bag in Atlanta when I got swarmed.
00:29:03.200,00:29:05.720,"It's just sitting there on the street, waiting to be picked up."
00:29:06.080,00:29:09.120,"-Ammo? -700 rounds, assorted."
00:29:11.000,00:29:12.840,LORI: You went through hell to find us.
00:29:13.480,00:29:16.160,You just got here and you're gonna turn around and leave?
00:29:17.360,00:29:18.880,"Dad, I don't want you to go."
00:29:21.600,00:29:24.160,To hell with the guns. Shane is right.
00:29:24.240,00:29:25.640,Merle Dixon?
00:29:26.560,00:29:29.520,"He's not worth one of your lives, even with guns thrown in."
00:29:31.360,00:29:33.040,Tell me. Make me understand.
00:29:33.120,00:29:37.280,I owe a debt to a man I met and his little boy.
00:29:37.920,00:29:41.040,"Lori, if they hadn't taken me in, I'd have died."
00:29:42.000,00:29:43.960,It's because of them that I made it back to you at all.
00:29:44.760,00:29:46.480,They said they'd follow me to Atlanta.
00:29:46.560,00:29:49.360,They'll walk into the same trap I did if I don't warn him.
00:29:50.200,00:29:51.360,What's stopping you?
00:29:52.880,00:29:55.200,"The walkie-talkie, the one in the bag I dropped."
00:29:55.280,00:29:56.560,He's got the other one.
00:29:56.640,00:29:58.320,Our plan was to connect when they got closer.
00:29:59.000,00:30:01.280,-These are our walkies? -Yeah.
00:30:01.360,00:30:03.280,So use the CB. What's wrong with that?
00:30:03.360,00:30:04.560,The CB's fine.
00:30:05.400,00:30:06.920,It's the walkies that suck. They're crap.
00:30:07.480,00:30:11.520,"Date back to the '70s, don't match any other bandwidth, not even the scanners in our cars."
00:30:14.320,00:30:15.720,I need that bag.
00:30:28.240,00:30:29.320,Okay?
00:30:34.240,00:30:35.560,All right.
00:30:40.080,00:30:41.920,Rumor is you have bolt cutters.
00:30:43.920,00:30:45.000,Maybe.
00:30:45.080,00:30:49.760,"T-DOG: Yeah, we get to that roof, though, we'll need to cut that chain and the handcuffs."
00:30:51.320,00:30:52.920,I never like lending tools.
00:30:53.720,00:30:54.880,The last time I did...
00:30:54.960,00:30:56.560,"And yes, I am talking about you..."
00:30:57.280,00:31:00.960,Let's just say that your bag of guns wasn't the only bag that was dropped.
00:31:01.040,00:31:03.280,My tools got left behind with Merle.
00:31:04.160,00:31:05.600,"RICK: We'll bring your tools back, too."
00:31:05.680,00:31:08.400,Think of the bolt cutters as an investment.
00:31:10.240,00:31:12.040,Sounds like more of a gamble.
00:31:19.400,00:31:21.560,-What do I get in return? -What do you want?
00:31:21.640,00:31:23.080,How about one of those guns you bring back?
00:31:23.560,00:31:25.920,-My pick. -Done.
00:31:29.120,00:31:30.640,Sweeten the deal a bit.
00:31:32.000,00:31:33.200,Now that cube van of yours...
00:31:34.200,00:31:35.440,What about it?
00:31:35.520,00:31:37.320,The RV's radiator hose is shot.
00:31:37.920,00:31:41.280,That's a problem if we need to get somewhere and wanna get very far.
00:31:41.360,00:31:44.680,And the hose on that van is just about a perfect match...
00:31:44.760,00:31:46.240,"Well, enough that I can make it fit."
00:31:47.240,00:31:51.760,"I'll tell you what, we get back, you can strip that van down to the bare metal."
00:31:54.440,00:31:56.760,"-Come on, let's go! -Thank you."
00:32:02.320,00:32:05.080,"Hey, Rick, got any rounds in the python?"
00:32:07.960,00:32:12.480,"Last time we were on the gun range, I'm sure I wound up with a few loose rounds of yours."
00:32:14.240,00:32:16.880,"You and that bag, like the bottom of an old lady's purse."
00:32:17.560,00:32:18.920,"I hate that you're doing this, man."
00:32:19.000,00:32:21.200,I think that it's foolish and reckless.
00:32:21.280,00:32:23.480,"But if you're gonna go, you're taking bullets."
00:32:24.400,00:32:29.560,"I'm not sure I'd want to fire a shot in the city, -not after what happened last time. -That's up to you."
00:32:30.640,00:32:31.880,Well...
00:32:35.680,00:32:37.000,"Four men, four rounds."
00:32:38.280,00:32:39.560,"What are the odds, huh?"
00:32:41.000,00:32:42.360,"Well, let's just hope that..."
00:32:42.840,00:32:44.880,"Let's just hope that four is your lucky number, okay?"
00:32:46.480,00:32:48.360,-Thank you. -All right.
00:33:20.920,00:33:23.160,"You know, I bet they'll be just fine."
00:33:24.160,00:33:25.280,I'm not worried.
00:33:28.880,00:33:30.160,Are you?
00:33:33.080,00:33:34.280,"Yeah, a little."
00:33:35.560,00:33:36.840,Don't be.
00:33:38.440,00:33:40.040,"-Why? -Think about it, Mom."
00:33:40.800,00:33:42.960,Everything that's happened to him so far...
00:34:02.640,00:34:04.120,DARYL: He'd better be okay.
00:34:04.760,00:34:05.960,It's my only word on the matter.
00:34:06.040,00:34:08.200,I told you the geeks can't get at him.
00:34:08.800,00:34:11.760,The only thing that's gonna get through that door is us.
00:34:15.320,00:34:16.400,We walk from here.
00:34:36.440,00:34:37.640,LORI: Dale.
00:34:38.200,00:34:40.960,-Have you seen Carl? -Shane took him down to the quarry.
00:34:41.040,00:34:43.920,There was some mighty bold talk about catching frogs.
00:34:54.080,00:34:55.400,I'm not getting anything.
00:34:56.600,00:34:57.760,Yeah.
00:35:00.160,00:35:01.840,"Little suckers, they know something's up."
00:35:01.920,00:35:03.040,That's what's going on.
00:35:04.040,00:35:06.040,Just going to have to do this the old-fashioned way.
00:35:07.160,00:35:08.520,"All right, little man, look."
00:35:08.600,00:35:10.960,"You are the... You are the key in all this, okay?"
00:35:11.680,00:35:14.560,"All I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go after one of them, all right, scare the rest of them off."
00:35:14.640,00:35:16.520,They're all gonna scatter. I'm gonna drive 'em your way. Okay?
00:35:16.600,00:35:19.920,"-All right. -What you need to do is you need to round up every bad boy you see, all right?"
00:35:20.000,00:35:21.080,-Are you with me? -Yeah.
00:35:21.160,00:35:22.760,-Hells yeah. Give me your mean face. -Yeah!
00:35:24.480,00:35:26.040,"-Yeah! -Are you ready? Here we go, boy."
00:35:37.040,00:35:38.480,"All right, little man, they're coming your way."
00:35:38.560,00:35:40.160,"They're coming your way. Go on, get 'em, get 'em."
00:35:40.240,00:35:41.560,"They're coming your way, come on."
00:35:43.720,00:35:44.840,"They're coming, little man!"
00:35:44.920,00:35:46.600,Get 'em! Get that net in there and get 'em!
00:35:46.680,00:35:48.040,"Come on, little man, get 'em."
00:35:48.120,00:35:50.680,I'm beginning to question the division of labor here.
00:35:50.760,00:35:53.200,"They're coming, little man! Get 'em! Get that net in there and get 'em!"
00:35:53.440,00:35:55.800,"What have you got, bad boy? What do you got? What do you got?"
00:35:56.680,00:35:57.720,Dirt.
00:35:57.800,00:36:00.360,"Oh boy. All right, we've got to start over."
00:36:03.920,00:36:07.720,Can someone explain to me how the women wound up doing all the Hattie McDaniel work?
00:36:07.800,00:36:09.440,The world ended. Didn't you get the memo?
00:36:13.000,00:36:14.080,It's just the way it is.
00:36:25.240,00:36:26.720,-Merle first or guns? -Merle!
00:36:26.800,00:36:29.440,-We ain't even having this conversation. -We are.
00:36:29.520,00:36:30.880,You know the geography. It's your call.
00:36:31.520,00:36:33.960,Merle's closest. The guns would mean doubling back.
00:36:34.040,00:36:35.160,Merle first.
00:36:40.360,00:36:42.120,I do miss my Maytag.
00:36:44.480,00:36:47.200,"I miss my Benz, my sat nav."
00:36:47.280,00:36:52.840,"I miss my coffeemaker with that dual-drip filter and built-in grinder, honey."
00:36:52.920,00:36:54.200,My computer...
00:36:54.960,00:36:56.080,And texting.
00:36:57.600,00:36:58.640,I miss my vibrator.
00:36:59.360,00:37:00.760,Oh!
00:37:14.680,00:37:16.280,What's so funny?
00:37:16.360,00:37:18.000,"Just swapping war stories, Ed."
00:37:19.200,00:37:20.360,Yeah.
00:37:31.920,00:37:33.360,"Problem, Ed?"
00:37:34.520,00:37:35.880,Nothin' that concerns you.
00:37:37.480,00:37:39.320,And you ought to focus on your work.
00:37:45.440,00:37:49.680,"Hey, Carl, what did I tell you about not leaving Dale's sight?"
00:37:49.760,00:37:51.720,"But Shane said we could catch frogs, remember?"
00:37:51.800,00:37:53.640,It doesn't matter what Shane says. It matters what I say.
00:37:56.120,00:37:57.680,I'll be right behind you.
00:38:02.000,00:38:05.760,"I've got to tell you, I do not think you should be taking this out on him."
00:38:05.840,00:38:07.680,You don't tell me what to do. You lost that privilege.
00:38:07.760,00:38:09.720,"Lori, could you just wait up a second?"
00:38:09.800,00:38:11.560,I think we should talk. We haven't had a chance...
00:38:11.640,00:38:13.840,"No, no, no. That's over too. You can tell that to the frogs."
00:38:13.920,00:38:16.040,"Damn it, Lori. Look, I don't know how it appears to you."
00:38:16.120,00:38:17.480,How it appears to me? I'm sorry.
00:38:17.560,00:38:20.200,Is there a gray area here? Let me dispel it.
00:38:20.280,00:38:22.200,You stay away from me. You stay away from my son.
00:38:22.280,00:38:24.080,You don't look at him. You don't talk to him.
00:38:24.160,00:38:26.400,"From now on, my family is off-limits to you."
00:38:29.640,00:38:30.720,"Lori, I don't think that's fair."
00:38:30.800,00:38:33.840,"-Shane, shut up. Don't... -I don't think that..."
00:38:33.920,00:38:36.280,My husband is back. He is alive.
00:38:39.760,00:38:41.880,Do you think I'm not happy about that?
00:38:42.720,00:38:45.160,How dare you? Why would you be?
00:38:45.240,00:38:48.080,You are the one that told me that he died.
00:38:49.960,00:38:51.640,You son of a bitch.
00:39:17.920,00:39:21.080,Damn. You are one ugly skank.
00:39:45.960,00:39:47.120,"Ed, tell you what..."
00:39:47.880,00:39:51.920,"You don't like how your laundry is done, you are welcome to pitch in and do it yourself. Here."
00:39:52.880,00:39:55.000,"-Oh! -Ain't my job, missy."
00:39:55.080,00:39:57.040,"-Andrea, don't. -What is your job, Ed?"
00:39:57.480,00:39:59.120,Sitting on your ass smoking cigarettes?
00:39:59.200,00:40:01.720,"Well, it sure as hell ain't listening to some uppity smart-mouthed bitch."
00:40:01.800,00:40:04.240,Tell you what... Come on. Let's go.
00:40:04.880,00:40:06.800,"I don't think she needs to go anywhere with you, Ed."
00:40:06.880,00:40:08.720,And I say it's none of your business. Come on now.
00:40:08.800,00:40:10.880,-You heard me. -Carol.
00:40:10.960,00:40:12.760,"Andrea, please. It doesn't matter."
00:40:12.840,00:40:21.240,"Hey, don't think I won't knock you on your ass just 'cause you're some college-educated cooze, Now you come on now or you gonna regret it later."
00:40:21.320,00:40:23.440,"So she can show up with fresh bruises later, Ed?"
00:40:25.720,00:40:27.720,ED: Stay out of this. Now come on!
00:40:27.920,00:40:29.840,You know what? This ain't none of y'all's business.
00:40:30.840,00:40:32.680,"You don't want to keep prodding the bull here, okay?"
00:40:32.760,00:40:35.200,Now I am done talking. Come on.
00:40:37.600,00:40:39.440,You don't tell me what! I tell you what!
00:40:42.920,00:40:44.520,-You think you can... -Get off her!
00:40:44.600,00:40:46.400,-Come here! Come here! -Get off her!
00:40:46.480,00:40:48.560,-Get off her! Get off her! -Get off me!
00:40:51.720,00:40:53.280,CAROL: No.
00:40:53.360,00:40:54.720,-It's okay. It's okay. -No.
00:41:07.720,00:41:09.040,Just stop!
00:41:10.560,00:41:12.520,CAROL: Stop it!
00:41:12.600,00:41:19.160,"-CAROL: Stop! -You put your hands on your wife, your little girl or anybody else in this camp one more time, I will not stop next time. Do you hear me?"
00:41:19.240,00:41:20.760,-Do you hear me? -Yes.
00:41:20.840,00:41:22.480,"-I'll beat you to death, Ed. -CAROL: Ed!"
00:41:25.600,00:41:26.800,No.
00:41:32.960,00:41:35.800,"CAROL: Oh, my God. Ed, I'm sorry."
00:41:37.880,00:41:40.400,"I'm so sorry, Ed."
00:41:40.480,00:41:43.280,"Ed, I'm sorry."
00:42:00.200,00:42:02.600,DARYL: Merle! Merle!
00:42:17.320,00:42:18.520,No!
00:42:29.760,00:42:32.520,No! No!
00:00:16.640,00:00:18.240,-What? -Nothing.
00:00:20.520,00:00:22.200,It's not nothing. It's always something.
00:00:24.080,00:00:25.920,Didn't dad teach you to tie nail knots?
00:00:26.520,00:00:29.480,Why would he do that? He only ever used a fisherman's knot.
00:00:33.640,00:00:36.160,"-One knot. -No, he didn't."
00:00:36.240,00:00:38.640,"No, he tied at least three."
00:00:38.720,00:00:40.160,Clinch knots?
00:00:40.880,00:00:42.200,No way.
00:00:42.280,00:00:43.600,"Fine, I'm making it up."
00:00:55.000,00:00:57.440,Did dad teach you mostly dry lures?
00:00:57.520,00:00:59.120,Yeah. You?
00:00:59.200,00:01:01.560,-Wet. -You're kidding.
00:01:03.080,00:01:04.200,But he was always so adamant.
00:01:04.280,00:01:06.480,"I mean, you know dad on the fishing thing."
00:01:06.560,00:01:08.160,"Gee, you think?"
00:01:08.240,00:01:11.320,I only spent my entire childhood with my ass in a boat.
00:01:11.400,00:01:13.960,But in my day it was all about getting the hook seated.
00:01:14.040,00:01:16.080,We were fishing for the dinner table.
00:01:16.160,00:01:18.480,Not us. We always threw them back.
00:01:18.560,00:01:20.480,-Always. -I guess he changed things up.
00:01:20.560,00:01:23.840,But that'd be like changing his religion or something.
00:01:23.920,00:01:27.440,People change. It's not his fault we were born 12 years apart.
00:01:28.040,00:01:29.120,No.
00:01:29.680,00:01:36.160,"No, because the minute you went off to college it was my ass in that boat and he taught me dry lures from day one."
00:01:37.560,00:01:40.040,This was not behavior developed over time.
00:01:50.440,00:01:51.640,You think he did it for us?
00:01:59.080,00:02:04.360,He knew that you needed to catch the fish and I needed to throw them back.
00:02:09.240,00:02:11.160,No crying in the boat.
00:02:12.600,00:02:14.280,It scares the fish.
00:02:16.120,00:02:17.600,Mom and dad...
00:02:18.120,00:02:22.840,"I mean, maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad."
00:02:23.360,00:02:25.320,Maybe it's better there.
00:02:26.160,00:02:27.640,Do you think?
00:02:33.680,00:02:35.640,I think you have a bite.
00:02:36.400,00:02:38.400,Even with the wrong knots.
00:02:41.160,00:02:42.400,"Oh, God."
00:02:44.880,00:02:47.160,So much for the no crying rule.
00:02:47.880,00:02:49.760,I think that was more for dad than the fish.
00:04:30.200,00:04:34.080,I won't hesitate. I don't care if every walker in the city hears it.
00:04:48.880,00:04:51.200,You got a do-rag or something?
00:05:07.160,00:05:10.120,"I guess the, uh, saw blade was too dull for the handcuffs."
00:05:10.680,00:05:11.800,Ugh.
00:05:12.600,00:05:39.960,"Ain't that a bitch DARYL: He must have used a tourniquet, maybe his belt."
00:05:41.240,00:05:42.640,Be much more blood if he didn't.
00:06:13.000,00:06:15.120,Merle? You in here?
00:06:32.560,00:06:35.000,Jim? You okay?
00:06:40.960,00:06:43.800,"You keep this up, you're gonna keel over out here."
00:06:49.520,00:06:50.600,Drink some water at least.
00:07:26.680,00:07:32.840,DARYL: Had enough in him to take out these two sumbitches one handed.
00:07:34.960,00:07:37.680,"Oh. Toughest asshole I ever met, my brother."
00:07:39.240,00:07:41.080,"Feed him a hammer, he'd crap out nails."
00:07:41.160,00:07:45.240,"Any man can pass out from blood loss, no matter how tough he is."
00:07:50.160,00:07:51.920,"MORALES: Oh, baby. Will you look at that?"
00:07:58.400,00:08:01.600,...because of you my children will eat tonight.
00:08:01.680,00:08:03.560,-Thank you. -Thank Dale.
00:08:03.640,00:08:05.440,It's his canoe and gear.
00:08:05.520,00:08:07.960,"CARL: Mom, look. Look at all the fish."
00:08:08.040,00:08:09.120,Thank you.
00:08:11.080,00:08:13.960,"Yeah, whoa. Where did you two learn to do that?"
00:08:14.400,00:08:16.600,-Our dad. -Can you teach me how to do that?
00:08:16.680,00:08:19.640,Sure. I'll teach you all about nail knots and stuff.
00:08:20.520,00:08:22.480,"-If that's okay. -Oh, you won't catch me arguing."
00:08:23.360,00:08:26.200,"Hey, Dale. When's the last time you oiled those line reels?"
00:08:26.280,00:08:28.880,"-They are a disgrace. -DALE: I, uh..."
00:08:28.960,00:08:33.440,"I don't want to alarm anyone, but we may have a bit of a problem."
00:08:48.640,00:08:51.120,-Merle! -We're not alone here.
00:08:51.200,00:08:53.080,-Remember? -Screw that.
00:08:53.760,00:08:55.560,He could be bleeding out. You said so yourself.
00:09:14.600,00:09:16.240,GLENN: What's that burned stuff?
00:09:17.280,00:09:18.440,Skin.
00:09:19.840,00:09:20.920,He cauterized the stump.
00:09:25.320,00:09:27.320,Told you he was tough.
00:09:27.400,00:09:28.840,Nobody can kill Merle but Merle.
00:09:29.240,00:09:31.760,Don't take that on faith. He's lost a lot of blood.
00:09:31.840,00:09:32.960,Yeah?
00:09:33.960,00:09:36.760,Didn't stop him from busting out of this death trap.
00:09:37.760,00:09:39.120,He left the building?
00:09:40.840,00:09:42.160,DARYL: Why wouldn't he?
00:09:42.240,00:09:47.240,"He's out there alone as far as he knows, doing what he's got to do."
00:09:47.320,00:09:48.520,Surviving.
00:09:49.840,00:09:51.400,T-DOG: You call that surviving?
00:09:51.480,00:09:53.800,"Just wandering out in the streets, maybe passing out?"
00:09:54.480,00:09:55.600,What are his odds out there?
00:09:55.680,00:09:58.440,No worse than being handcuffed and left to rot by you sorry pricks.
00:10:01.480,00:10:03.280,You couldn't kill him.
00:10:03.360,00:10:05.800,I ain't so worried about some dumb dead bastard.
00:10:05.880,00:10:08.040,"What about 1,000 dead dumb bastards?"
00:10:08.120,00:10:09.920,-Different story? -Why don't you take a tally?
00:10:10.480,00:10:12.320,Do what you want. I'm gonna go get him.
00:10:12.400,00:10:14.480,"-Daryl, wait. -Get your hands off me!"
00:10:14.560,00:10:16.440,-You can't stop me. -I don't blame you.
00:10:16.520,00:10:19.000,"He's family, I get that. I went through hell to find mine."
00:10:19.400,00:10:20.640,I know exactly how you feel.
00:10:23.120,00:10:24.360,He can't get far with that injury.
00:10:24.440,00:10:28.320,We could help you check a few blocks around but only if we keep a level head.
00:10:31.040,00:10:32.320,I could do that.
00:10:36.080,00:10:38.120,Only if we get those guns first.
00:10:38.200,00:10:41.800,"I'm not strolling the streets of Atlanta with just my good intentions, okay?"
00:11:01.760,00:11:03.000,"Hey, Jim."
00:11:05.960,00:11:07.200,"Jim, why don't you hold up, all right?"
00:11:07.280,00:11:09.880,"-Just give me a second here, please. -What do you want?"
00:11:10.400,00:11:12.880,"We're all just a little concerned, man, that's all."
00:11:12.960,00:11:14.040,Dale says you've been out here for hours.
00:11:15.840,00:11:17.680,-So? -So why are you digging?
00:11:19.840,00:11:21.560,"Are you heading to China, Jim?"
00:11:22.160,00:11:24.000,What does it matter? I'm not hurting anyone.
00:11:24.640,00:11:25.840,"Yeah, except maybe yourself."
00:11:25.920,00:11:29.240,It's 100 degrees today. You can't keep this up.
00:11:29.320,00:11:30.800,Sure I can. Watch me.
00:11:31.600,00:11:34.040,"Jim, they're not gonna say it, so I will."
00:11:34.120,00:11:36.000,You're scaring people.
00:11:36.080,00:11:38.320,You're scaring my son and Carol's daughter.
00:11:39.560,00:11:41.400,They got nothing to be scared of.
00:11:43.480,00:11:45.240,"I mean, what the hell, people? I'm out here by myself."
00:11:45.320,00:11:47.960,Why don't you all just go and leave me the hell alone?
00:11:50.360,00:11:53.360,"We think that you need to take a break, okay?"
00:11:53.440,00:11:55.560,Why don't you go and get yourself in the shade?
00:11:55.640,00:12:01.120,"Some food maybe. I'll tell you what, maybe in a little bit I'll come out here and help you myself."
00:12:01.200,00:12:03.120,"Jim, just tell me what it's about."
00:12:03.200,00:12:04.800,Why don't you just go ahead and give me that shovel?
00:12:04.880,00:12:07.160,-Or what? -There is no or what.
00:12:07.840,00:12:10.440,"I'm asking you. I'm coming to you and I'm asking you, please."
00:12:10.520,00:12:12.080,I don't want to have to take it from you.
00:12:12.640,00:12:15.040,"And if I don't, then what?"
00:12:16.120,00:12:19.280,"Then you're gonna beat my face in like Ed Peletier, aren't you?"
00:12:20.080,00:12:22.240,"Y'all seen his face, huh? What's left of it."
00:12:23.760,00:12:25.840,"See, now that's what happens when someone crosses you."
00:12:26.800,00:12:27.880,"That was different, Jim."
00:12:27.960,00:12:31.000,You weren't there. Ed was out of control. He was hurting his wife.
00:12:31.080,00:12:32.600,That is their marriage. That is not his.
00:12:33.360,00:12:36.200,"He is not judge and jury. Who voted you king boss, huh?"
00:12:36.280,00:12:37.760,"SHANE: Jim, I'm not here to argue with you, all right?"
00:12:37.840,00:12:39.760,"-Just give me the shovel, okay? -No, no, no."
00:12:42.880,00:12:44.720,"-Okay, shh shh. -You got no right!"
00:12:44.800,00:12:46.040,-Stop. Shh. -You got no right!
00:12:46.120,00:12:48.000,"Jim, just stop it. Hey, hey, hey, hey."
00:12:48.080,00:12:50.080,"-Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you. -Don't!"
00:12:50.160,00:12:51.880,You hear me? Shh.
00:12:54.480,00:12:56.680,That's a lie. That's the biggest lie there is.
00:12:57.680,00:13:00.720,I told that to my wife and my two boys.
00:13:00.800,00:13:04.000,I said it 100 times. It didn't matter.
00:13:04.680,00:13:07.560,They came out of nowhere. There were dozens of 'em.
00:13:09.520,00:13:10.960,Just pulled 'em right out of my hands.
00:13:16.280,00:13:20.640,"You know, the only reason I got away was 'cause the dead were too busy eating my family."
00:13:28.440,00:13:29.880,You're not doing this alone.
00:13:29.960,00:13:32.320,Even I think it's a bad idea and I don't even like you much.
00:13:32.400,00:13:35.520,"It's a good idea, okay, if you just hear me out."
00:13:37.080,00:13:39.920,"If we go out there in a group, we're slow, drawing attention."
00:13:40.000,00:13:42.720,"If I'm alone, I can move fast."
00:13:46.080,00:13:49.120,"That's the tank, five blocks from where we are now."
00:13:49.200,00:13:50.600,That's the bag of guns.
00:13:50.680,00:13:52.680,Here's the alley I dragged you into when we first met.
00:13:52.760,00:13:54.640,-That's where Daryl and I will go. -Why me?
00:13:55.280,00:13:56.840,Your crossbow is quieter than his gun.
00:14:04.400,00:14:05.760,"What, you got us elsewhere?"
00:14:05.840,00:14:07.200,"GLENN: You and T-Dog, right."
00:14:07.760,00:14:10.640,-You'll be in this alley here. -Two blocks away? Why?
00:14:10.720,00:14:12.200,I may not be able to come back the same way.
00:14:12.880,00:14:14.040,Walkers might cut me off.
00:14:14.680,00:14:17.000,"If that happens, I won't go back to Daryl."
00:14:17.080,00:14:20.680,"I'll go forward instead, all the way around to that alley where you guys are."
00:14:21.520,00:14:23.640,"Whichever direction I go, I got you in both places to cover me."
00:14:25.680,00:14:26.960,"Afterwards, we'll all meet back here."
00:14:27.560,00:14:29.320,"Hey, kid, what'd you do before all this?"
00:14:30.160,00:14:32.520,Delivered pizzas. Why?
00:15:02.560,00:15:04.600,You got some balls for a Chinaman.
00:15:04.680,00:15:06.640,-I'm Korean. -Whatever.
00:15:35.360,00:15:37.280,"Whoa, don't shoot me! What do you want?"
00:15:37.360,00:15:39.440,I'm looking for my brother. He's hurt real bad. You seen him?
00:15:39.520,00:15:40.760,-iAyúdame! -Shut up!
00:15:40.840,00:15:42.680,You're gonna bring the geeks down on us. Answer me.
00:15:54.840,00:15:56.160,-Answer me. -iAyúdame!
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.200,iAyúdame!
00:16:00.840,00:16:02.160,iAyúdame!
00:16:06.000,00:16:07.160,Shut up.
00:16:07.240,00:16:08.800,Shut up.
00:16:15.680,00:16:17.080,"That's it. That's the bag, vato."
00:16:17.160,00:16:18.240,Take it! Take it!
00:16:18.320,00:16:20.160,Ah! Ah!
00:16:26.760,00:16:28.440,Get off me! Get off me!
00:16:29.160,00:16:30.840,Get off me! Get off!
00:16:31.280,00:16:32.520,Daryl!
00:16:32.600,00:16:33.880,Daryl!
00:16:37.640,00:16:39.880,"Come back here, you sumbitches!"
00:16:48.000,00:16:49.720,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it!"
00:16:49.800,00:16:51.280,I'm gonna kick your nuts up in your throat!
00:16:53.040,00:16:56.200,They took Glenn. That little bastard and his little bastard homie friends.
00:16:56.280,00:16:57.840,I'm gonna stomp your ass!
00:16:57.920,00:16:59.520,Guys! Guys! We're cut off!
00:17:00.080,00:17:01.400,Get to the lab. Go!
00:17:05.040,00:17:06.120,"Come on. Damn, let's go."
00:17:21.200,00:17:23.000,"Jim, take some water?"
00:17:24.160,00:17:25.400,-All right. -Yeah?
00:17:25.480,00:17:26.560,All right.
00:17:30.240,00:17:31.400,"Here you go, bud."
00:17:37.120,00:17:38.880,-Pour some on my head? -Yeah.
00:17:46.600,00:17:48.000,"Cooling you down, huh?"
00:17:48.080,00:17:49.200,Yeah.
00:17:53.600,00:17:55.280,How long you gonna keep me like this?
00:17:55.360,00:17:57.520,"Well, yeah."
00:17:57.600,00:18:01.160,Until I don't think that you're a danger to yourself or others.
00:18:08.280,00:18:11.400,Sorry if I scared your boy and your little girl.
00:18:13.000,00:18:15.240,You had sunstroke. Nobody's blaming you.
00:18:15.320,00:18:16.960,"You're not scared now, are you?"
00:18:18.000,00:18:19.280,"No, sir."
00:18:26.800,00:18:29.240,Your mama's right. Sun just cooked my head is all.
00:18:29.320,00:18:31.960,"Jim, do you know why you were digging?"
00:18:34.320,00:18:35.560,Can you say?
00:18:35.640,00:18:37.360,I had a reason. Don't remember.
00:18:40.880,00:18:42.720,Something I dreamt last night.
00:18:47.840,00:18:49.200,Your dad was in it. You were too.
00:18:49.280,00:18:51.320,You were worried about him. Can't remember the rest.
00:18:53.800,00:18:54.920,You worried about your dad?
00:18:55.720,00:18:57.000,They're not back yet.
00:18:58.120,00:18:59.480,We don't need to talk about that.
00:18:59.560,00:19:01.400,"Your dad's a police officer, son."
00:19:02.480,00:19:06.320,"He helps people. Probably just came across some folks needing help, that's all."
00:19:06.400,00:19:08.760,"That man, he is tough as nails."
00:19:09.880,00:19:11.720,I don't know him well but...
00:19:12.920,00:19:14.440,I could see it in him.
00:19:14.920,00:19:16.320,Am I right?
00:19:16.840,00:19:18.000,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:21.280,00:19:25.040,"There ain't nothing gonna stop him from getting back here to you and your mom, I promise you that."
00:19:31.160,00:19:32.480,All right.
00:19:32.560,00:19:34.880,"Who wants to help me clean some fish, huh?"
00:19:34.960,00:19:36.920,"Sweet. Come on, Sophia."
00:19:37.000,00:19:38.720,"Stay with Carol, all right?"
00:19:57.920,00:19:59.400,You keep your boy close.
00:20:00.120,00:20:02.280,You don't ever let him out of your sight.
00:20:12.120,00:20:14.240,"Those men you were with, we need to know where they went."
00:20:15.320,00:20:16.880,I ain't telling you nothing.
00:20:16.960,00:20:19.480,"Jesus, man. What the hell happened back there?"
00:20:19.560,00:20:23.320,"I told you, this little turd and his douche bag friends came out of nowhere and jumped me."
00:20:23.400,00:20:28.440,"You're the one who jumped me, puto, screaming about trying to find his brother like it's my damn fault."
00:20:28.520,00:20:30.600,They took Glenn. Could have taken Merle too.
00:20:30.680,00:20:32.720,Merle? What kind of hick name is that?
00:20:32.800,00:20:34.120,I wouldn't name my dog Merle.
00:20:34.880,00:20:36.680,"Damn it, Daryl! Back off!"
00:20:43.880,00:20:46.200,Want to see what happened to the last guy that pissed me off?
00:20:54.480,00:20:56.440,Start with the feet this time.
00:21:00.760,00:21:02.360,The men you were with took our friend.
00:21:02.440,00:21:05.000,"All we want to do is talk to them, see if we can work something out."
00:21:14.000,00:21:15.800,You sure you're up for this?
00:21:15.880,00:21:17.080,-Yeah. -Okay.
00:21:20.680,00:21:24.040,"One wrong move, you get an arrow in the ass. Just so you know."
00:21:24.360,00:21:28.640,G's gonna take that arrow out of my ass and shove it up yours. Just so you know.
00:21:28.720,00:21:31.280,-G? -Guillermo.
00:21:33.320,00:21:34.840,Okay then.
00:21:34.920,00:21:36.240,Let's go see Guillermo.
00:22:26.760,00:22:28.120,"You okay, little man?"
00:22:28.200,00:22:30.120,"They're gonna cut off my feet, carnal."
00:22:31.840,00:22:33.160,Cops do that?
00:22:33.240,00:22:35.120,Not him. This redneck puto here.
00:22:35.520,00:22:37.160,"He cut off some dude's hand, man. He showed it to me."
00:22:37.240,00:22:38.480,Shut up.
00:22:38.560,00:22:39.760,"Hey, that's that vato right there, homes."
00:22:39.840,00:22:41.640,"He shot me in the ass with an arrow. What's up, homes, huh?"
00:22:41.720,00:22:43.840,"Chill, ese, chill. Chill."
00:22:46.480,00:22:48.040,This true?
00:22:48.320,00:22:50.400,He wants Miguelito's feet?
00:22:50.480,00:22:51.720,"That's pretty sick, man."
00:22:51.800,00:22:54.040,We were hoping more for a calm discussion.
00:23:03.120,00:23:05.560,-You fascinate me. -Heat of the moment.
00:23:05.640,00:23:08.120,Mistakes were made on both sides.
00:23:10.360,00:23:13.120,Who's that dude to you anyway? You don't look related.
00:23:13.200,00:23:15.720,"He's one of our group, more or less."
00:23:15.800,00:23:18.040,I'm sure you have a few like him.
00:23:18.120,00:23:19.800,You got my brother in there?
00:23:22.560,00:23:24.160,But I've got Asian. You interested?
00:23:24.680,00:23:27.480,"I have one of yours, you have one of mine."
00:23:27.840,00:23:29.280,Sounds like an even trade.
00:23:29.360,00:23:32.600,-Don't sound even to me. -G.
00:23:32.680,00:23:34.480,"-Come on, man. -My people got attacked."
00:23:34.560,00:23:36.200,Where's the compensation for their pain and suffering?
00:23:39.000,00:23:41.480,-Guns? -The bag Miguel saw in the street.
00:23:41.560,00:23:43.000,The bag Felipe and Jorge were going back to get.
00:23:43.080,00:23:44.920,-That bag of guns. -You're mistaken.
00:23:45.000,00:23:47.080,-I don't think so. -About it being yours.
00:23:47.440,00:23:48.640,It's my bag of guns.
00:23:50.200,00:23:51.440,The bag was in the street.
00:23:51.520,00:23:53.440,Anybody could come around and say it was theirs.
00:23:53.520,00:23:54.920,I'm supposed to take your word?
00:23:56.960,00:24:00.200,What's to stop my people from unloading on you right here and now and I take what's mine?
00:24:02.920,00:24:04.600,You could do that.
00:24:07.280,00:24:08.520,Or not.
00:24:10.640,00:24:13.720,"Come on, man. Make the trade."
00:24:13.800,00:24:14.920,Please.
00:24:17.200,00:24:18.360,Oye.
00:24:32.240,00:24:33.960,I see two options.
00:24:34.040,00:24:37.720,"You come back with Miguel and my bag of guns, everybody walks."
00:24:37.800,00:24:42.120,"Or you come back locked and loaded, we'll see which side spills more blood."
00:25:04.520,00:25:06.240,Them guns are worth more than gold.
00:25:06.320,00:25:08.960,Gold won't protect your family or put food on the table.
00:25:09.800,00:25:11.120,You're gonna give that up for that kid?
00:25:12.760,00:25:14.640,"T-DOG: If I knew we'd get Glenn back, I might agree."
00:25:14.720,00:25:17.480,But you think that vato across the way is just gonna hand him over?
00:25:17.560,00:25:19.320,-You calling G a liar? -Are you a part of this?
00:25:19.400,00:25:21.120,You want to hold onto your teeth?
00:25:24.080,00:25:26.000,"Question is, do you trust that man's word?"
00:25:26.080,00:25:28.120,"DARYL: No, question is, what are you willing to bet on it?"
00:25:28.200,00:25:30.880,Could be more than them guns. Could be your life.
00:25:35.360,00:25:37.920,What life I have I owe to him.
00:25:38.000,00:25:42.160,"I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank."
00:25:42.240,00:25:44.720,"He could have walked away, but he didn't."
00:25:44.800,00:25:47.000,-Neither will I. -So you're gonna hand the guns over?
00:25:48.520,00:25:49.600,I didn't say that.
00:25:52.520,00:25:53.840,There's nothing keeping you two here.
00:25:53.920,00:25:55.880,"You should get out, head back to camp."
00:25:55.960,00:25:57.400,And tell your family what?
00:26:09.720,00:26:11.400,"Come on, this is nuts."
00:26:14.040,00:26:15.760,Just...
00:26:15.840,00:26:17.360,Just do like G says.
00:26:48.080,00:26:50.760,"I see my guns, but they're not all in the bag."
00:26:51.400,00:26:53.120,That's because they're not yours.
00:26:53.200,00:26:54.520,I thought I mentioned that.
00:26:54.600,00:26:56.080,"Let's just shoot these fools right now, ese."
00:26:56.160,00:26:57.840,"-All right? -Unload on their asses, ese."
00:26:59.080,00:27:01.640,I don't think you fully appreciate the gravity of the situation.
00:27:01.720,00:27:03.600,"No, I'm pretty clear."
00:27:06.560,00:27:09.600,You have your man. I want mine.
00:27:12.640,00:27:15.480,I'm gonna chop up your boy. I'm gonna feed him to my dogs.
00:27:15.920,00:27:18.720,"They're the evilest, nastiest man-eating bitches you ever saw."
00:27:18.800,00:27:20.360,I picked them up from Satan at a yard sale.
00:27:21.960,00:27:23.680,I told you how it has to be. Are you willfully deaf?
00:27:23.760,00:27:26.520,"No, my hearing's fine. You said come locked and loaded."
00:27:29.600,00:27:30.880,"Okay then, we're here."
00:27:37.120,00:27:39.320,WOMAN: Felipe! Felipe!
00:27:41.360,00:27:44.920,"Abuela, go back with the others, now!"
00:27:45.000,00:27:46.320,Get that old lady out of the line of fire!
00:27:46.920,00:27:48.920,"Abuela, listen to your mijo, okay?"
00:27:50.440,00:27:53.640,Mr. Gilbert is having trouble breathing.
00:27:53.720,00:27:56.280,He needs his asthma stuff.
00:27:56.360,00:27:57.560,Carlito didn't find it.
00:27:58.560,00:28:00.160,He needs his medicine.
00:28:03.280,00:28:05.720,"Felipe, go take care of it, okay? And take your grandmother with you."
00:28:08.440,00:28:10.280,Who are those men?
00:28:13.720,00:28:15.600,-Ma'am? -Felipe's a good boy.
00:28:15.680,00:28:18.880,He have his trouble but he pull himself together.
00:28:18.960,00:28:20.040,We need him here.
00:28:22.160,00:28:25.880,"Ma'am, I'm not here to arrest your grandson."
00:28:25.960,00:28:27.680,Then what do you want him for?
00:28:28.880,00:28:30.160,He's...
00:28:31.200,00:28:33.400,Helping us find a missing person.
00:28:33.480,00:28:34.960,Fella named Glenn.
00:28:35.040,00:28:36.440,The Asian boy?
00:28:37.400,00:28:38.960,He's with Mr. Gilbert.
00:28:39.040,00:28:41.880,"Come. Come, I show you."
00:28:42.560,00:28:44.120,He needs his medicine.
00:28:46.440,00:28:47.880,Let 'em pass.
00:29:15.760,00:29:18.200,"Abuela, por favor. Take me to him."
00:29:48.760,00:29:50.920,All right. All right.
00:29:51.000,00:29:53.040,Nice and easy. Just breathe.
00:29:53.120,00:29:55.080,Just breathe. Just let it out. Just breathe.
00:29:58.320,00:29:59.760,WOMAN: Just relax.
00:30:04.160,00:30:05.840,Couldn't get his breath all of a sudden.
00:30:05.920,00:30:07.680,"I thought you were being eaten by dogs, man."
00:30:13.000,00:30:15.000,Could I have a word with you?
00:30:15.080,00:30:17.800,You're the dumbest son of a bitch I ever met.
00:30:17.880,00:30:21.000,We walked in there ready to kill every last one of you.
00:30:21.080,00:30:23.200,"Well, I'm glad it didn't go down that way."
00:30:23.280,00:30:26.560,"If it had, that blood would be on my hands."
00:30:26.640,00:30:29.040,Mine too. We'd have fought back.
00:30:29.120,00:30:30.760,Wouldn't be the first time we've had to.
00:30:30.840,00:30:34.400,"Protect the food, the medicine... What's left of it."
00:30:34.480,00:30:38.320,"These people, the old ones, the staff took off, just left 'em here to die."
00:30:43.600,00:30:44.880,Me and Felipe were the only ones who stayed.
00:30:47.480,00:30:49.480,"What are you, doctors?"
00:30:50.480,00:30:53.240,"Felipe's a nurse, a special care provider."
00:30:54.160,00:30:57.640,"Me, I'm the custodian."
00:31:09.720,00:31:11.680,What about the rest of your crew?
00:31:12.280,00:31:16.240,"The vatos trickle in to check on their parents, their grandparents."
00:31:16.320,00:31:18.760,They see how things are and most decide to stay.
00:31:18.840,00:31:21.000,It's a good thing too. We need the muscle.
00:31:22.120,00:31:29.880,"The people we've encountered since things fell apart, the worst kind, plunderers, the kind that take by force."
00:31:29.960,00:31:32.560,-That's not who we are. -How was I to know?
00:31:32.640,00:31:35.880,My people got attacked and you show up with Miguel hostage...
00:31:37.280,00:31:39.040,appearances.
00:31:39.120,00:31:40.880,Guess the world changed.
00:31:40.960,00:31:42.320,GUILLERMO: No.
00:31:48.360,00:31:50.320,So we do what we can here.
00:31:50.400,00:31:54.280,"The vatos work on those cars, talk about getting the old people out of the city."
00:31:54.360,00:31:57.920,"But most can't even get to the bathroom by themselves, so that's just a dream."
00:31:58.200,00:32:01.680,"Still, it keeps the crew busy, and that's worth something."
00:32:03.920,00:32:07.440,"So we barred all the windows, welded all the doors shut except for one entrance."
00:32:07.520,00:32:10.920,"The vatos, they go out, scavenge what they can to keep us going."
00:32:12.040,00:32:14.720,We watch the perimeter night and day and we wait.
00:32:17.840,00:32:22.160,"The people here, they all look to me now."
00:32:22.960,00:32:24.440,I don't even know why.
00:32:26.880,00:32:28.400,Because they can.
00:32:48.680,00:32:51.320,"GLENN: Admit it, you only came back to Atlanta for the hat."
00:32:51.400,00:32:52.760,RICK: Don't tell anybody.
00:32:52.840,00:32:54.960,You've given away half our guns and ammo.
00:32:55.040,00:32:57.080,-Not nearly half. -For what?
00:32:57.160,00:32:59.320,Bunch of old farts who are gonna die off momentarily anyhow?
00:32:59.400,00:33:01.880,"Seriously, how long you think they got?"
00:33:01.960,00:33:03.560,How long do any of us?
00:33:07.200,00:33:09.440,"-GLENN: Oh, my God. -Where the hell's our van?"
00:33:09.520,00:33:10.680,We left it right there. Who would take it?
00:33:10.760,00:33:11.880,Merle.
00:33:14.560,00:33:16.560,He's gonna be taking some vengeance back to camp.
00:33:28.560,00:33:31.440,"Wrapping paper, color tissue, anything?"
00:33:32.640,00:33:34.080,How can you not have any?
00:33:34.160,00:33:37.240,Had I been informed of the impending apocalypse I'd have stocked up.
00:33:38.200,00:33:40.120,It's Amy's birthday tomorrow.
00:33:40.200,00:33:42.640,I've been marking days on the calendar just to make sure.
00:33:46.200,00:33:47.480,You don't give a gift unwrapped.
00:33:49.200,00:33:50.360,Deep breath.
00:33:52.800,00:33:54.480,I'm sure I'll find something here.
00:34:01.960,00:34:04.960,"I, uh, built up the rocks all around. See?"
00:34:05.040,00:34:08.480,So the flames can be a little higher and have 'em be hidden.
00:34:11.480,00:34:12.560,"Hey, Jim. How you feeling, man?"
00:34:12.640,00:34:16.000,I'm better. More myself now.
00:34:16.080,00:34:18.520,I hope you understand the need for this...
00:34:18.600,00:34:20.040,This timeout.
00:34:20.680,00:34:23.120,I've got others I've got to think about.
00:34:23.640,00:34:26.000,I just want to make sure there's no...
00:34:26.080,00:34:28.280,-There's no hard feelings. -There's not.
00:34:28.360,00:34:29.560,I do understand.
00:34:32.440,00:34:34.880,Why don't you come join in with the rest of us?
00:34:34.960,00:34:36.600,Big ol' fish fry.
00:34:38.880,00:34:40.840,I'd like that very much.
00:34:44.640,00:34:45.960,Why don't you come outside with everybody?
00:34:47.320,00:34:49.000,Hell with them people.
00:34:49.080,00:34:50.520,Wouldn't piss on them if their heads was on fire.
00:34:52.160,00:34:53.320,Hey!
00:34:54.080,00:34:55.680,Why don't you stay here?
00:34:56.440,00:34:57.880,Keep your daddy company.
00:34:59.160,00:35:01.240,"Ed, she wants to join in."
00:35:02.560,00:35:04.360,-Come on. -ED: Fine.
00:35:05.120,00:35:06.680,Hell with the both of you.
00:35:21.320,00:35:24.600,"CAROL: Here you go. SHANE: Man o man, that's good."
00:35:27.920,00:35:29.320,I miss this.
00:35:38.880,00:35:41.440,"I've got to ask you, man. It's been driving me crazy."
00:35:42.040,00:35:43.600,-What? -That watch.
00:35:46.040,00:35:47.680,What's wrong with my watch?
00:35:47.760,00:35:54.520,"I see you every day, the same time, winding that thing like a village priest saying mass."
00:35:54.600,00:35:56.720,I've wondered this myself.
00:35:56.800,00:36:02.120,"-I'm missing the point. -JACQUI: Unless I've misread the signs, the world seems to have come to an end."
00:36:03.440,00:36:05.440,At least hit a speed bump for a good long while.
00:36:05.520,00:36:08.720,But there's you every day winding that stupid watch.
00:36:08.800,00:36:11.040,"Time, it's important to keep track, isn't it?"
00:36:11.920,00:36:13.440,The days at least.
00:36:14.760,00:36:15.840,"Don't you think, Andrea?"
00:36:22.920,00:36:32.320,"I like... I like what, um, a father said the son when he gave him a watch that it had been handed down through generations."
00:36:33.120,00:37:04.960,"He said, I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire, which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me, I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it."
00:37:14.640,00:37:15.840,You are so weird.
00:37:17.360,00:37:20.600,It's not me. It's Faulkner. William Faulkner.
00:37:20.680,00:37:22.400,Maybe my bad paraphrasing.
00:37:29.360,00:37:31.880,-Where are you going? -I have to pee.
00:37:32.560,00:37:34.480,"Jeez, you try to be discreet around here."
00:37:41.680,00:37:43.800,"Thought I told y'all to leave me the hell alone, didn't I?"
00:37:46.080,00:37:47.240,Hey!
00:37:52.640,00:37:53.720,Oh!
00:37:55.760,00:37:56.800,We're out of toilet paper?
00:38:12.840,00:38:14.480,-CARL: Mom! -Carl!
00:38:16.440,00:38:18.120,"Lori, get him down!"
00:38:24.200,00:38:26.800,"-Oh, my God. -Go! Go!"
00:38:41.080,00:38:42.720,"LORI: I'm right here. Shane, what do we do?"
00:38:42.800,00:38:44.560,-Shane? -MORALES: Follow me!
00:38:50.200,00:38:51.760,No! No!
00:38:54.240,00:38:55.520,Oh! Oh!
00:38:56.760,00:38:58.760,"Oh, God! Oh, my God!"
00:39:02.800,00:39:04.240,"Oh, God, I don't know what to do."
00:39:04.320,00:39:05.400,I don't know what to do.
00:39:08.480,00:39:11.000,"-Come on. Come on, stay close. -Carol!"
00:39:11.080,00:39:12.440,Stay close!
00:39:21.120,00:39:23.320,"SHANE: Come on, y'all! Work your way up here!"
00:39:23.400,00:39:25.320,LORI: Right in front of you. Shane!
00:39:26.280,00:39:28.320,MORALES: Get to the RV! Go!
00:39:29.160,00:39:31.200,-LORI: Shane! Shane! -Stay with me.
00:39:33.920,00:39:36.880,"Stay behind me. Morales, work up here!"
00:39:38.080,00:39:39.880,-LORI: Get behind me! Come on! -SHANE: Let's go!
00:39:41.640,00:39:43.120,"SHANE: Come on, make your way to the Winnebago!"
00:40:05.160,00:40:07.200,Baby! Carl!
00:40:08.240,00:40:09.600,-Baby! -Dad!
00:40:09.680,00:40:10.720,Carl!
00:40:38.800,00:40:40.160,"Oh, Amy."
00:40:48.120,00:40:51.200,"I don't know what to do, Amy."
00:41:30.160,00:41:31.360,Oh.
00:41:32.080,00:41:33.280,Oh.
00:41:34.520,00:41:35.760,Oh.
00:41:36.760,00:41:37.920,Oh.
00:41:39.600,00:41:40.800,Oh.
00:41:41.640,00:41:42.720,Oh.
00:42:01.720,00:42:03.680,"Oh, no, no."
00:42:06.240,00:42:07.760,Amy!
00:42:11.600,00:42:13.120,Amy!
00:42:13.880,00:42:19.080,"I remember my dream now, why I dug the holes."
00:00:05.000,00:00:06.960,I don't know if you're out there.
00:00:07.280,00:00:09.120,I don't know if you can hear me.
00:00:09.440,00:00:11.160,Maybe you're listening right now.
00:00:11.240,00:00:12.760,I hope so.
00:00:13.360,00:00:16.880,"I found others, my family, if you can believe it."
00:00:19.200,00:00:23.200,"My wife and son, they're alive."
00:00:23.280,00:00:25.040,I wanted you to know that.
00:00:28.120,00:00:29.800,There's something else you need to know.
00:00:29.880,00:00:31.200,Atlanta isn't what we thought.
00:00:31.280,00:00:33.880,It's not what they promised. The city is...
00:00:39.120,00:00:41.160,It belongs to the dead now.
00:00:44.720,00:00:49.240,"We're camped a few miles northwest, up by a big abandoned rock quarry."
00:00:49.400,00:00:50.960,You can see it on a map.
00:00:53.560,00:00:55.200,I hope you come find us.
00:00:55.680,00:00:56.920,But be careful.
00:00:58.800,00:01:01.480,Last night walkers came out of the woods.
00:01:04.200,00:01:05.800,We lost people.
00:01:07.840,00:01:10.520,"Watch yourself, Morgan. Take care of your boy."
00:01:10.600,00:01:12.760,I'll try you again tomorrow at dawn.
00:01:30.080,00:01:31.760,Andrea.
00:01:37.360,00:01:39.480,I'm so sorry.
00:01:41.400,00:01:43.320,She's gone.
00:01:43.760,00:01:46.800,You got to let us take her.
00:01:53.360,00:01:57.720,We all cared about her and I promise we'll be as... As gentle as we can.
00:02:34.040,00:02:35.520,She still won't move?
00:02:36.960,00:02:38.360,LORI: She won't even talk to us.
00:02:40.080,00:02:41.920,She's been there all night.
00:02:42.920,00:02:44.200,What do we do?
00:02:45.120,00:02:46.920,Can't just leave Amy like that.
00:02:47.400,00:02:50.840,"We need to deal with it, same as the others."
00:02:52.760,00:02:54.240,I'll tell her how it is.
00:03:01.320,00:03:03.080,I know how the safety works.
00:03:06.640,00:03:09.200,All right. Okay.
00:03:09.440,00:03:10.920,I'm sorry.
00:03:12.760,00:03:15.680,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
00:04:02.480,00:04:04.000,Y'all can't be serious.
00:04:04.080,00:04:05.960,Let that girl hamstring us?
00:04:06.040,00:04:07.520,The dead girl's a time bomb.
00:04:07.600,00:04:09.200,What do you suggest?
00:04:11.720,00:04:12.960,Take the shot.
00:04:13.360,00:04:15.320,"Clean, in the brain from here."
00:04:15.400,00:04:17.440,"Hell, I can hit a turkey between the eyes from this distance."
00:04:17.520,00:04:20.760,"No. For God's sakes, let her be."
00:04:34.200,00:04:36.240,"Wake up, Jimbo. We've got some work to do."
00:04:42.800,00:04:44.400,"Well, what are you guys doing?"
00:04:44.480,00:04:47.520,This is for geeks. Our people go over there.
00:04:47.600,00:04:48.800,What's the difference? They're all infected.
00:04:48.880,00:04:51.160,Our people go in that row over there.
00:04:53.120,00:04:54.680,We don't burn them!
00:04:56.080,00:04:57.560,We bury them.
00:04:58.320,00:04:59.800,Understand?
00:05:03.600,00:05:05.360,Our people go in that row over there.
00:05:12.520,00:05:13.840,You reap what you sow.
00:05:13.920,00:05:15.520,"You know what? Shut up, man."
00:05:16.240,00:05:17.960,You all left my brother for dead.
00:05:19.360,00:05:20.920,You had this coming.
00:05:31.520,00:05:32.680,Are you bleeding?
00:05:33.440,00:05:35.600,I just got some on me from the bodies.
00:05:35.680,00:05:37.960,That blood is fresh. Were you bit?
00:05:38.480,00:05:39.600,No.
00:05:39.680,00:05:41.080,I got scratched during the attack.
00:05:42.720,00:05:43.920,Then show me.
00:05:50.720,00:05:52.280,A walker bit Jim.
00:05:56.960,00:05:58.640,-JIMMY: I'm okay. -Show it to us.
00:06:01.600,00:06:02.920,"SHANE: Easy, Jim. DARYL: Grab him."
00:06:03.400,00:06:05.280,"Jim, put it down. Put it down."
00:06:05.600,00:06:07.640,I'm okay. I'm okay.
00:06:07.720,00:06:10.080,I'm okay. I'm okay.
00:06:14.360,00:06:16.160,I'm okay. I'm okay.
00:06:16.240,00:06:17.320,I'm okay.
00:06:23.720,00:06:25.520,I'm okay.
00:06:31.920,00:06:35.240,I say we put a pickaxe in his head and the dead girl's and be done with it.
00:06:35.320,00:06:37.080,"Is that what you'd want, if it were you?"
00:06:37.160,00:06:39.240,"Yeah, and I'd thank you while you did it."
00:06:39.320,00:06:42.680,"I hate to say it, I never thought I would, but maybe Daryl's right."
00:06:42.760,00:06:45.600,"Jim's not a monster, Dale, or some rabid dog."
00:06:45.680,00:06:47.760,-I'm not suggesting... -He's sick. A sick man.
00:06:47.840,00:06:49.720,"We start down that road, where do we draw the line?"
00:06:49.800,00:06:55.760,"The line's pretty clear. Zero tolerance for walkers, -or them to be. -What if we can get him help?"
00:06:55.840,00:06:57.680,I heard the CDC was working on a cure.
00:06:57.760,00:07:00.320,"I heard that, too. Heard a lot of things before the world went to hell."
00:07:00.400,00:07:02.040,What if the CDC is still up and running?
00:07:02.120,00:07:04.560,"-Man, that is a stretch right there. -RICK: Why?"
00:07:05.160,00:07:10.680,"If there's any government left, any... Any structure at all, they'd protect the CDC at all costs, wouldn't they?"
00:07:10.760,00:07:13.400,"I think it's our best shot. Shelter, protection..."
00:07:13.480,00:07:16.240,"Okay, Rick, you want those things, all right? I do too, okay."
00:07:16.320,00:07:19.440,"Now if they exist, they're at the army base."
00:07:19.520,00:07:22.240,-Fort Benning. -That's 100 miles in -the opposite direction. -SHANE: That is right.
00:07:22.320,00:07:23.480,But it's away from the hot zone.
00:07:23.560,00:07:26.480,"Now listen to me. If that place is operational, it'll be heavily armed."
00:07:27.560,00:07:28.640,We'd be safe there.
00:07:28.720,00:07:30.480,RICK: The military were on the front lines of this thing.
00:07:30.560,00:07:33.080,They got overrun. We've all seen that.
00:07:33.160,00:07:36.400,The CDC is our best choice and Jim's only chance.
00:07:38.680,00:07:41.160,"You go looking for aspirin, do what you need to do."
00:07:41.240,00:07:44.200,"Someone needs to have some balls to take care -of this damn problem! -Hey, hey, hey!"
00:07:44.280,00:07:46.400,We don't kill the living.
00:07:49.560,00:07:53.320,That's funny coming from a man who just put a gun to my head.
00:07:53.400,00:07:57.960,"We may disagree on some things, not on this. You put it down."
00:07:58.200,00:07:59.400,Go on.
00:08:03.600,00:08:05.240,-Come with me. -Where are you taking me?
00:08:05.320,00:08:06.800,Somewhere safe.
00:08:15.640,00:08:17.640,I came to pay my respects.
00:08:35.640,00:08:40.200,Did I ever mention how I lost my wife?
00:08:44.560,00:08:46.840,"-Cancer, wasn't it? -Yeah."
00:08:47.680,00:08:52.440,"I... I dragged her to every doctor, every test."
00:08:53.520,00:08:59.760,"And after all the surgeries and the chemos, she was ready."
00:09:00.320,00:09:02.160,"She accepted it, you know?"
00:09:04.160,00:09:05.800,But I never could.
00:09:06.840,00:09:12.640,And I spent the last few years so angry.
00:09:13.760,00:09:15.600,I felt so cheated.
00:09:19.360,00:09:29.040,"Since she passed, you girls were the first people that I cared anything for."
00:09:47.600,00:09:49.320,This is her birthday?
00:09:52.480,00:09:54.480,"Her birthday was always like, um..."
00:09:54.920,00:09:56.600,Like a week-long affair.
00:09:57.600,00:09:59.920,But I somehow always missed it.
00:10:00.840,00:10:05.360,I was away at college or too busy for kid's parties.
00:10:06.680,00:10:09.200,She'd call all excited.
00:10:10.000,00:10:19.600,"I always said that I'd make it home and I really always meant to, but I never made it past that phone call."
00:10:20.600,00:10:25.160,"You know, things are hard enough for you without adding guilt into the mix, huh?"
00:11:07.880,00:11:11.240,I'll do it. He's my husband.
00:13:01.520,00:13:02.840,Amy.
00:13:09.320,00:13:11.080,"Amy, I'm sorry."
00:13:24.400,00:13:27.240,I always thought there'd be more time.
00:13:48.440,00:13:49.920,"I'm here now, Amy."
00:13:51.560,00:13:52.960,I'm here.
00:13:58.240,00:13:59.760,I love you.
00:14:23.600,00:14:24.960,Say it.
00:14:27.680,00:14:28.960,Okay.
00:14:32.080,00:14:35.600,"I'm thinking if you'd have stayed here, if you'd have looked after your own..."
00:14:36.000,00:14:39.080,Instead you went off. You took half our manpower with you.
00:14:40.520,00:14:43.200,I'm thinking maybe our losses wouldn't have been so bad.
00:14:43.280,00:14:47.680,"If we hadn't gone off and brought those guns back when we did, I think our losses would have been a lot worse."
00:15:04.160,00:15:06.920,I still think it's a mistake not burning these bodies.
00:15:07.240,00:15:09.160,"It's what we said we'd do, right?"
00:15:09.240,00:15:11.400,"Burn 'em all, wasn't that the idea?"
00:15:11.480,00:15:12.880,RICK: At first.
00:15:13.200,00:15:17.720,"The Chinaman gets all emotional, says it's not the thing to do, we just follow him along?"
00:15:19.360,00:15:24.680,"These people need to know who the hell's in charge here, -what the rules are. -There are no rules."
00:15:24.760,00:15:26.320,"Well, that's a problem."
00:15:27.360,00:15:30.000,We haven't had one minute to hold onto anything of our old selves.
00:15:30.080,00:15:33.640,We need time to mourn and we need to bury our dead.
00:15:34.600,00:15:36.040,It's what people do.
00:15:39.080,00:15:40.320,"Oh, no."
00:15:41.240,00:15:42.920,"No, no, no, no."
00:15:44.240,00:15:46.160,"No, not this, please."
00:15:58.800,00:16:00.160,"No, no, no."
00:16:17.280,00:16:19.840,I can do it! I can do it.
00:17:00.400,00:17:04.600,"Burying other people is bad enough, -but the thought of one of us... -Shh."
00:17:05.400,00:17:07.120,"Are we safe now, Dad?"
00:17:08.320,00:17:09.640,Now that we're together?
00:17:11.880,00:17:13.800,I promise you that. Not for anything.
00:17:16.480,00:17:21.120,"Now give me a chance to discuss some things with your mom, okay?"
00:17:21.360,00:17:22.880,-Yeah. -All right.
00:17:23.160,00:17:24.760,All right.
00:17:31.200,00:17:33.880,Shane blames me for not being here.
00:17:34.920,00:17:36.160,Do you?
00:17:41.680,00:17:44.520,We got guns now. We... We're stronger.
00:17:44.600,00:17:46.440,And we have fewer people.
00:17:46.520,00:17:48.200,That makes us weaker.
00:17:49.600,00:17:51.240,You want me to say I think you were right?
00:17:56.480,00:18:00.080,All I can say is that neither one of you is entirely wrong.
00:18:01.120,00:18:02.880,It's the best I can do right now.
00:18:06.520,00:18:08.160,What about the CDC?
00:18:10.080,00:18:12.240,-Rick... -We're at the ragged edge here.
00:18:12.320,00:18:14.920,We need relief and we got... We got a sick man who needs help.
00:18:15.000,00:18:16.680,I don't know why people can't see that.
00:18:16.760,00:18:18.400,"Well, look at their faces."
00:18:18.880,00:18:21.320,Look at mine. We're all terrified.
00:18:21.960,00:18:28.920,"If one of us suggested, based on a hunch, that we head toward that city, you'd have no part of it."
00:18:31.440,00:18:33.280,Tell me something with certainty.
00:18:44.240,00:18:45.440,I love you.
00:18:49.840,00:18:51.800,That's all I got.
00:18:54.360,00:18:56.160,I love you too.
00:19:07.360,00:19:09.080,His fever is worse.
00:19:10.760,00:19:12.040,You need anything?
00:19:12.360,00:19:13.720,Uh...
00:19:14.240,00:19:16.160,"Uh, water. Could use more water."
00:19:16.240,00:19:17.680,-LORI: I'll get some. -Okay.
00:19:17.760,00:19:19.680,"Carol, you help me?"
00:19:32.120,00:19:33.520,You save a grave for me?
00:19:36.360,00:19:37.960,Nobody wants that.
00:19:38.600,00:19:40.440,It's not about what you want.
00:19:43.520,00:19:48.400,"That, uh... That sound you hear, that's God laughing while you make plans."
00:19:55.720,00:19:58.200,"What I want, Jim, if..."
00:19:59.640,00:20:02.360,"If God allows, is to get you some help."
00:20:21.440,00:20:24.080,Oh! Uh!
00:20:31.960,00:20:33.840,Watch the mangroves.
00:20:37.720,00:20:39.240,"You know that, right?"
00:20:41.040,00:20:44.160,Amy is there swimming.
00:20:46.960,00:20:48.880,"You'll watch the boat, right?"
00:20:50.160,00:20:51.800,You said you would.
00:20:54.240,00:20:55.800,I'll watch the boat.
00:20:57.200,00:20:58.480,Don't worry.
00:21:01.920,00:21:03.400,Okay.
00:21:14.720,00:21:17.000,I need you to help talk some sense into Rick.
00:21:19.920,00:21:23.000,"Look, the CDC thing, Lori, it's a mistake."
00:21:24.640,00:21:25.880,So you're backing him?
00:21:26.160,00:21:27.720,What else would I do? He's my husband.
00:21:27.800,00:21:33.680,"Look, it may be time for you to play the dutiful wife, but you can't tell me that fixing your marriage is worth putting people's lives at risk."
00:21:33.760,00:21:36.800,Folks around here can make up their minds without bringing my marriage into it.
00:21:37.840,00:21:39.400,It's a habit you need to break.
00:21:41.200,00:21:45.880,I guess I'll just add it to the list of habits that I'm breaking whether I like it or not.
00:21:48.280,00:21:49.680,What habits?
00:21:51.320,00:21:54.080,"Just talking about my need for a plan, man."
00:21:55.560,00:21:57.160,So what is it? Are we leaving or not?
00:21:57.480,00:21:58.760,Maybe y'all just want to stay here.
00:21:58.840,00:22:01.080,We could hang some more tin cans.
00:22:01.160,00:22:02.760,We can't stay here. We both know that.
00:22:02.840,00:22:05.640,I was just telling Shane I think we should trust your gut.
00:22:15.040,00:22:16.640,Let's go do our sweep.
00:22:26.520,00:22:31.280,"Tell you what, man, these people, man, they're not convinced. You know?"
00:22:32.240,00:22:35.600,"You head to the CDC, you might be on your own."
00:22:36.200,00:22:40.960,You gotta really consider whether you want to put Lori and Carl in that kind of spot.
00:22:41.240,00:22:43.080,I got to do what's best for my family.
00:22:43.160,00:22:45.280,Best for your family? What's that?
00:22:45.360,00:22:47.960,-Exposing them to all kinds of risks? -As opposed to what?
00:22:48.520,00:22:51.280,Crossing 100 miles of hostile territory?
00:22:52.120,00:22:56.360,"If we're looking for a lifeline, I say swim toward the closest ship, not further out to sea."
00:22:57.800,00:23:01.240,"-Why can't you back me up? -Look, I want to. It's just..."
00:23:02.680,00:23:03.960,I don't see it.
00:23:04.040,00:23:06.800,"Uh, if it was your family, you'd feel differently."
00:23:11.840,00:23:13.040,What did you say to me?
00:23:16.520,00:23:18.200,"I kept them safe, man."
00:23:19.120,00:23:21.080,I looked after them like they... Like they were my own.
00:23:21.160,00:23:23.600,-That's what I did. -I... I didn't mean it that way.
00:23:23.680,00:23:24.840,"Well, how'd you mean it?"
00:23:26.280,00:23:27.720,"Go on, man. How'd you mean it?"
00:23:30.440,00:23:31.760,-All right. -You're just hearing it wrong.
00:23:31.840,00:23:34.400,"-Yeah? -Look, you know..."
00:23:34.480,00:23:37.960,"You know I can never repay that debt, okay?"
00:24:22.920,00:24:24.240,Jesus.
00:24:30.080,00:24:31.400,I know.
00:24:34.360,00:24:37.040,Gonna have to start wearing reflective vests out here.
00:24:39.720,00:24:41.240,Seriously.
00:24:42.120,00:24:43.360,"Come on, man."
00:24:48.280,00:24:49.560,"Come on, man, let's go."
00:24:49.640,00:24:50.880,Nothing out here.
00:25:06.840,00:25:08.440,"I've, uh..."
00:25:09.080,00:25:11.000,I've been thinking about Rick's plan.
00:25:11.480,00:25:13.080,"Now look, there are no..."
00:25:13.440,00:25:15.600,There are no guarantees either way.
00:25:15.680,00:25:17.520,I'll be the first one to admit that.
00:25:18.400,00:25:20.240,I've known this man a long time.
00:25:22.120,00:25:23.480,I trust his instincts.
00:25:26.000,00:25:29.800,I say the most important thing here is we need to stay together.
00:25:32.920,00:25:38.360,"So those of you that agree, we leave first thing in the morning."
00:25:40.720,00:25:41.920,Okay?
00:25:49.280,00:25:50.640,leaving the quarry.
00:25:52.320,00:25:54.400,"If you heard me yesterday, you may be coming here."
00:25:54.480,00:25:58.280,"If you are, we'll be gone by the time you arrive."
00:25:59.680,00:26:06.720,I'm leaving a note and map behind for you taped to a red car so you can follow our trail.
00:26:07.920,00:26:09.640,We're heading to the CDC.
00:26:09.720,00:26:12.640,"If there's anything left, it's got to be there, don't you think?"
00:26:14.920,00:26:20.440,"Morgan, I hope you were right about that place."
00:26:21.600,00:26:23.960,I need you to be.
00:26:34.960,00:26:36.360,SHANE: Everybody listen up.
00:26:36.880,00:26:39.640,"Those of you with CBs, we're gonna be on channel 40."
00:26:39.720,00:26:41.320,"Let's keep the chatter down, okay?"
00:26:41.720,00:26:46.840,"Now you got a problem, don't have a CB, can't get a signal or anything at all, you're gonna hit your horn one time."
00:26:47.000,00:26:48.440,That'll stop the caravan.
00:26:49.040,00:26:51.240,"-Any questions? -MORALES: We're, uh..."
00:26:52.320,00:26:53.600,We're not going.
00:26:56.320,00:26:58.000,We have family in Birmingham.
00:26:58.640,00:27:00.280,We want to be with our people.
00:27:00.360,00:27:02.600,"You go on your own, you won't have anyone to watch your back."
00:27:05.240,00:27:06.880,I got to do what's best for my family.
00:27:10.520,00:27:11.920,We're sure.
00:27:12.800,00:27:14.120,All right.
00:27:14.200,00:27:16.120,"-Shane. -Yeah, all right."
00:27:16.200,00:27:17.840,-.357? -SHANE: Yeah.
00:27:23.560,00:27:24.800,The box is half full.
00:27:28.320,00:27:31.560,Thank you all for everything.
00:27:34.120,00:27:35.280,"Good luck, man."
00:27:35.360,00:27:37.120,-Appreciate it. -SHANE: Yeah.
00:27:37.880,00:27:39.160,Bye.
00:27:39.920,00:27:41.160,Thank you.
00:27:42.920,00:27:44.280,Bye.
00:27:46.040,00:27:48.760,Channel 40 if you change your minds.
00:27:49.160,00:27:50.840,-All right? -Yeah.
00:27:50.920,00:27:52.200,I know.
00:27:55.440,00:27:57.800,What makes you think our odds are any better?
00:27:58.960,00:28:01.120,Come on. Let's go.
00:29:32.200,00:29:34.560,I told you we'd never get far on that hose.
00:29:35.040,00:29:37.520,I said I needed the one from the cube van.
00:29:38.040,00:29:39.560,Can you jerry-rig it?
00:29:39.640,00:29:40.920,That's all it's been so far.
00:29:44.040,00:29:45.720,And I'm out of duct tape.
00:29:47.080,00:29:48.640,SHANE: I see something up ahead.
00:29:49.920,00:29:51.520,A gas station if we're lucky.
00:29:52.280,00:29:53.920,"Y'all, Jim..."
00:29:54.000,00:29:56.720,It's bad. I don't think he can take anymore.
00:29:58.320,00:30:00.040,"Hey, Rick, you want to hold down the fort?"
00:30:00.120,00:30:01.760,"I'll drive ahead, see what I can bring back."
00:30:01.840,00:30:04.280,"Yeah, I'll come along too and I'll back you up."
00:30:04.360,00:30:05.720,SHANE: Y'all keep your eyes open now.
00:30:05.800,00:30:07.000,We'll be right back.
00:30:15.040,00:30:16.480,We'll be back on the road soon.
00:30:16.560,00:30:18.560,"Oh, no. Christ."
00:30:20.320,00:30:23.040,My bones... My bones are like glass.
00:30:23.120,00:30:27.120,"Every little bump... God, this ride's killing me."
00:30:28.560,00:30:29.880,Leave me here.
00:30:32.360,00:30:33.720,I'm done.
00:30:36.400,00:30:37.920,Just leave me.
00:30:39.480,00:30:41.360,I want to be with my family.
00:30:45.840,00:30:47.360,They're all dead.
00:30:48.920,00:30:51.240,I don't think you know what you're asking.
00:30:51.480,00:30:54.600,"The fever, you've been delirious more often than not."
00:31:01.360,00:31:02.840,I'm clear now.
00:31:03.640,00:31:06.160,"In five minutes, I may not be."
00:31:06.240,00:31:09.040,"Rick, I know what I'm asking."
00:31:09.680,00:31:11.200,I want this.
00:31:12.800,00:31:14.360,Leave me here.
00:31:15.280,00:31:17.120,Now that's on me.
00:31:18.160,00:31:19.400,Okay?
00:31:19.720,00:31:21.240,My decision.
00:31:22.240,00:31:24.000,Not your failure.
00:31:29.040,00:31:30.920,It's what he says he wants.
00:31:31.240,00:31:32.720,And he's lucid?
00:31:33.200,00:31:34.920,He seems to be.
00:31:35.560,00:31:37.160,I would say yes.
00:31:38.320,00:31:45.240,"Back in the camp when I said Daryl might be right and you shut me down, you misunderstood."
00:31:45.440,00:31:50.880,I would never go along with callously killing a man.
00:31:51.520,00:31:57.160,I was just gonna suggest that we ask Jim what he wants.
00:31:59.440,00:32:01.440,And I think we have an answer.
00:32:03.200,00:32:04.720,SHANE: We just leave him here?
00:32:05.120,00:32:06.600,We take off?
00:32:07.320,00:32:09.360,"Man, I'm not sure I could live with that."
00:32:09.840,00:32:13.320,"LORI: It's not your call, either one of you."
00:32:23.920,00:32:26.920,"Hey, another damn tree."
00:32:29.600,00:32:31.200,"Hey, Jim..."
00:32:31.840,00:32:33.640,"I mean, you know it doesn't need to be this."
00:32:34.360,00:32:35.560,No.
00:32:36.720,00:32:38.080,It's good.
00:32:38.560,00:32:40.640,The breeze feels nice.
00:32:41.560,00:32:43.800,Okay. All right.
00:32:51.680,00:32:53.480,"Just close your eyes, sweetie."
00:32:53.560,00:32:54.840,Don't fight.
00:33:07.640,00:33:10.880,"Jim, do you want this?"
00:33:12.120,00:33:13.600,No.
00:33:14.360,00:33:15.680,You'll need it.
00:33:18.760,00:33:20.160,I'm okay.
00:33:22.720,00:33:24.200,I'm okay.
00:33:28.400,00:33:30.560,Oh. Hey.
00:33:32.400,00:33:34.160,"Thanks for, uh..."
00:33:34.760,00:33:36.200,For fighting for us.
00:33:37.240,00:33:38.600,Okay.
00:34:50.040,00:34:51.320,Jenner here.
00:34:52.040,00:34:58.520,It's day 194 since Wildfire was declared and 63 days since the disease abruptly went global.
00:34:59.000,00:35:01.200,There's no clinical progress to report.
00:35:06.000,00:35:09.120,"Item, I finally got the scrubbers in the east sector shut down to save power."
00:35:09.200,00:35:11.640,"Wish I could have done it a month ago, but it took me that long to figure it out."
00:35:11.720,00:35:13.440,Too bad I never studied engineering.
00:35:13.520,00:35:15.080,Could have saved a lot of amps.
00:35:15.160,00:35:18.280,"Item, I'm still not sleeping well."
00:35:19.200,00:35:21.240,Can't seem to keep regular hours.
00:35:21.320,00:35:24.560,"Living underground doesn't help, not knowing if it's day or night."
00:35:25.320,00:35:29.760,I'm just feeling very off-kilter these days.
00:36:38.000,00:36:39.320,COMPUTER: Alert status.
00:36:39.400,00:36:42.480,Air qualifiers indicate corrosive fumes.
00:36:42.560,00:36:44.600,All personnel must clear the room.
00:36:44.680,00:36:48.080,Corrosive element is deemed poisonous if inhaled.
00:37:03.520,00:37:05.360,All personnel clear.
00:37:05.440,00:37:07.360,Full decontamination in effect.
00:37:07.440,00:37:08.680,No!
00:37:19.000,00:37:21.480,Full decontamination complete.
00:37:27.120,00:37:29.480,The TS-19 samples are gone.
00:37:30.040,00:37:33.280,The tragedy of their loss cannot be overstated.
00:37:35.200,00:37:37.840,They were our freshest samples by far.
00:37:39.040,00:37:41.920,None of the other samples we gathered even came close.
00:37:43.240,00:37:48.080,"Those are necrotic, useless dead flesh."
00:37:58.120,00:38:02.040,"I bet there isn't a single son of a bitch out there still listening, is there?"
00:38:05.760,00:38:07.200,Is there?
00:38:10.640,00:38:11.920,Fine.
00:38:12.560,00:38:14.920,Saves me the embarrassment.
00:38:20.960,00:38:23.200,I think tomorrow I'm gonna blow my brains out.
00:38:26.000,00:38:27.840,I haven't decided.
00:38:30.400,00:38:34.000,"But tonight, I'm getting drunk."
00:38:42.720,00:38:47.080,"Speaking of which, how far do you think I can chuck this, huh?"
00:38:48.280,00:38:50.160,Pretty far I bet.
00:38:55.920,00:38:58.200,It is out of the stadium!
00:39:34.400,00:39:36.560,Stay quiet. Let's go.
00:39:56.520,00:39:58.680,-Keep moving. Come on. -Shh.
00:40:02.520,00:40:04.200,-LORI: Carol. -Shh.
00:40:04.560,00:40:05.880,"Oh, God."
00:40:27.560,00:40:29.040,No.
00:40:30.360,00:40:31.840,Keep it together. Come on.
00:40:32.360,00:40:35.040,"LORI: We're almost there, baby. Almost there."
00:40:45.600,00:40:47.480,T-DOG: There's nobody here.
00:40:47.720,00:40:49.520,Then why are these shutters down?
00:40:49.880,00:40:51.880,"DARYL: Walkers! LORI: Baby, come on."
00:40:55.880,00:40:57.480,You led us into a graveyard!
00:40:57.560,00:41:00.280,-He made a call. -It was the wrong damn call!
00:41:00.360,00:41:02.280,-You hear me? -Just shut up. Shut up. Shut up!
00:41:02.360,00:41:04.240,"-Rick, this is a dead end. -Where are we gonna go?"
00:41:04.320,00:41:06.080,Do you hear me? No blame.
00:41:06.160,00:41:08.520,"She's right. We can't be here, this close to the city after dark."
00:41:10.600,00:41:12.320,"Fort Benning, Rick, still an option."
00:41:12.400,00:41:14.840,"On what? No food, no fuel. That's 100 miles."
00:41:14.920,00:41:16.320,125. I checked the map.
00:41:16.400,00:41:18.280,"Forget Fort Benning. We need answers tonight, now."
00:41:18.360,00:41:21.280,"-We'll think of something. -Come on, let's go."
00:41:21.360,00:41:23.520,-Let's get out of here. -Let's go please.
00:41:25.840,00:41:27.080,everybody back to the cars. Let's go. Move.
00:41:27.160,00:41:29.080,"The camera, it moved."
00:41:29.800,00:41:32.480,-You imagined it. -It moved.
00:41:32.840,00:41:35.360,"-It moved. -Rick, it is dead, man."
00:41:35.960,00:41:38.640,"It's an automated device, man. It's gears, okay?"
00:41:38.720,00:41:40.120,They're just winding down. Now come on.
00:41:40.200,00:41:42.120,"-No, just go away. -SHANE: Man, just listen to me."
00:41:42.200,00:41:44.360,"Look around this place. It's dead, okay?"
00:41:44.440,00:41:46.360,"It's dead. You need to let it go, Rick."
00:41:47.480,00:41:49.960,"-LORI: Rick, there's nobody here! -I know you're in there."
00:41:50.040,00:41:54.160,"-I know you can hear me. -SHANE: Everybody get back -to the cars now! Go! -RICK: Please, we're desperate."
00:41:54.240,00:41:58.600,"Please help us. We have women, children, -no food, hardly any gas left. -Rick."
00:41:58.720,00:42:00.320,-There's nobody here. -We have nowhere else to go.
00:42:02.520,00:42:05.320,"If you don't let us in, you're killing us!"
00:42:05.560,00:42:07.840,"-Please! -Come on, buddy, let's go."
00:42:07.920,00:42:09.480,-Let's go. -RICK: Please help us.
00:42:11.480,00:42:14.480,You're killing us! You're killing us!
00:42:14.560,00:42:16.080,You're killing us!
00:00:05.440,00:00:08.200,"Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa!"
00:00:08.680,00:00:10.280,"Ma'am. Ma'am, please."
00:00:10.360,00:00:11.920,"-Please, can you help me? -No, no!"
00:00:46.640,00:00:47.640,"I'm gonna get you out of here, bud."
00:01:02.480,00:01:03.720,What do I do?
00:01:09.440,00:01:10.640,"SOLDIER: Come on, Corporal. Move out!"
00:01:23.040,00:01:26.560,"Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up, I need you to do it now. Okay, now!"
00:01:26.640,00:01:29.000,"Please, man, just show me a sign. Anything."
00:01:35.640,00:01:37.040,The place is coming down!
00:01:37.120,00:01:38.800,MAN ON RADIO: Fall back... MAN 2: All units fall back.
00:03:20.560,00:03:22.040,"SHANE: Daryl, you cover the back."
00:03:23.920,00:03:24.920,Hello?
00:03:27.680,00:03:29.360,-Hello? -Watch those doors.
00:03:29.440,00:03:30.520,Watch for walkers.
00:03:42.160,00:03:43.440,Anybody infected?
00:03:44.040,00:03:45.520,One of our group was.
00:03:46.680,00:03:48.080,He didn't make it.
00:03:49.960,00:03:51.560,Why are you here? What do you want?
00:03:52.440,00:03:53.600,A chance.
00:03:54.920,00:03:56.720,That's asking an awful lot these days.
00:03:58.560,00:03:59.720,I know.
00:04:11.360,00:04:12.560,You all submit to a blood test.
00:04:12.640,00:04:14.000,That's the price of admission.
00:04:14.680,00:04:16.000,We can do that.
00:04:18.160,00:04:19.680,"You got stuff to bring in, you do it now."
00:04:19.760,00:04:21.720,"Once this door closes, it stays closed."
00:04:29.600,00:04:31.160,Kill the power up here.
00:04:36.760,00:04:38.240,Rick Grimes.
00:04:39.600,00:04:41.160,Dr. Edwin Jenner.
00:04:44.560,00:04:46.760,Doctors always go around packing heat like that?
00:04:47.120,00:04:49.680,"Oh, there were plenty left lying around. I familiarized myself."
00:04:54.600,00:04:55.680,Except you.
00:04:56.800,00:04:58.440,I'll have to keep my eye on you.
00:05:05.840,00:05:07.400,CAROL: Are we underground?
00:05:08.240,00:05:10.160,-JENNER: Are you claustrophobic? -A little.
00:05:10.640,00:05:12.080,Try not to think about it.
00:05:16.720,00:05:19.320,"Vi, bring up the lights in the big room."
00:05:25.400,00:05:26.920,Welcome to Zone 5.
00:05:28.240,00:05:29.720,Where is everybody?
00:05:30.120,00:05:31.360,"The other doctors, the staff?"
00:05:34.440,00:05:35.640,I'm it.
00:05:36.560,00:05:38.000,It's just me here.
00:05:42.120,00:05:43.360,Vi?
00:05:44.120,00:05:46.120,"JENNER: Vi, say hello to our guests."
00:05:47.200,00:05:50.760,"Tell them, Welcome."
00:05:50.880,00:05:53.240,"COMPUTER: Hello, guests. Welcome."
00:05:54.320,00:05:55.640,I'm all that's left.
00:05:59.720,00:06:00.880,I'm sorry.
00:06:05.000,00:06:06.120,What's the point?
00:06:06.200,00:06:08.280,"If we were infected, we'd all be running a fever."
00:06:09.680,00:06:11.800,I've already broken every rule in the book letting you in here.
00:06:11.880,00:06:13.680,Let me just at least be thorough.
00:06:20.160,00:06:21.560,-Ooh. -JENNER: Are you okay?
00:06:22.200,00:06:23.680,-Mmm. -She hasn't eaten in days.
00:06:24.560,00:06:25.920,None of us have.
00:06:30.920,00:06:35.920,"You know, in Italy, children have a little bit of wine with dinner."
00:06:36.000,00:06:37.120,And in France.
00:06:37.440,00:06:40.880,"Well, and when Carl is in Italy or France, he can have some then."
00:06:40.960,00:06:42.480,What's it gonna hurt? Come on.
00:06:49.040,00:06:50.640,"DALE: There you are, young lad."
00:06:56.520,00:06:58.440,-Yuck! -That's my boy. That's my boy.
00:07:01.280,00:07:03.320,-Good boy. -That tastes nasty.
00:07:05.440,00:07:07.120,"Well, just stick to soda pop there, bud."
00:07:07.280,00:07:08.680,"-DARYL: Not you, Glenn. -What?"
00:07:08.760,00:07:09.800,"Keep drinking, little man."
00:07:19.240,00:07:21.920,It seems to me we haven't thanked our host properly.
00:07:22.240,00:07:23.680,He is more than just our host.
00:07:24.040,00:07:26.560,"-Hear, hear! -Here's to you, Doc. Booyah!"
00:07:26.800,00:07:28.280,-ALL: Booyah! -Thank you!
00:07:31.240,00:07:33.480,"So, when are you gonna tell us what the hell happened here, Doc?"
00:07:33.560,00:07:34.560,Hmm?
00:07:35.840,00:07:41.360,"All the, uh... The other doctors that were supposed to be figuring out what happened?"
00:07:41.840,00:07:43.880,"-Where are they? -RICK: We're celebrating, Shane."
00:07:44.760,00:07:46.120,Don't need to do this now.
00:07:46.520,00:07:47.840,"SHANE: Whoa, wait a second."
00:07:48.320,00:07:49.760,"This is why we're here, right?"
00:07:51.080,00:07:52.280,This was your move.
00:07:53.200,00:07:54.240,Supposed to find all the answers.
00:07:58.440,00:07:59.720,Found one man.
00:07:59.840,00:08:00.920,Why?
00:08:02.400,00:08:04.920,"JENNER: Well, when things got bad, a lot of people just..."
00:08:05.360,00:08:06.600,Left.
00:08:07.360,00:08:09.040,Went off to be with their families.
00:08:10.520,00:08:16.080,"And when things got worse, when the military cordon got overrun, the rest bolted."
00:08:17.000,00:08:19.440,-Every last one? -No.
00:08:19.920,00:08:22.720,Many couldn't face walking out the door.
00:08:24.640,00:08:27.240,They opted out.
00:08:28.400,00:08:30.240,There was a rash of suicides.
00:08:33.480,00:08:34.880,That was a bad time.
00:08:35.800,00:08:37.120,You didn't leave.
00:08:38.160,00:08:39.520,Why?
00:08:41.080,00:08:43.720,Hoping to do some good.
00:08:47.960,00:08:50.600,"Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man."
00:08:54.000,00:08:58.600,"Most of the facility is powered down, including housing, so you'll have to make do here."
00:08:59.240,00:09:02.680,"The couches are comfortable, but there are cots in storage if you like."
00:09:04.240,00:09:06.840,There's a rec room down the hall that you kids might enjoy.
00:09:06.920,00:09:09.760,"Just don't plug in the video games, okay?"
00:09:09.880,00:09:14.240,"Or anything that draws power. The same applies if you shower, go easy on the hot water."
00:09:41.600,00:09:42.880,Ah.
00:10:37.560,00:10:38.720,That's it.
00:10:39.000,00:10:41.160,That's it. Get it out.
00:10:42.520,00:10:43.760,There you go.
00:10:58.800,00:11:00.360,Everything's gone.
00:11:01.560,00:11:03.520,"It's always better going down than coming up, huh?"
00:11:03.600,00:11:05.040,"I don't mean the wine, Dale."
00:11:06.040,00:11:09.280,"You know, it's over. There's nothing left."
00:11:10.640,00:11:11.880,Don't you see that?
00:11:12.160,00:11:14.880,"Oh, I... I see a..."
00:11:15.400,00:11:17.440,A chance to make a new start.
00:11:19.280,00:11:20.800,"Oh, my God, Dale."
00:11:21.480,00:11:24.200,"Dale, didn't you see the look on Jenner's face?"
00:11:25.360,00:11:26.920,Hear what I'm saying.
00:11:27.680,00:11:30.040,There's nothing left.
00:11:37.400,00:11:38.760,How's the blood?
00:11:39.080,00:11:40.320,No surprises.
00:11:48.400,00:11:49.800,I came to thank you.
00:11:52.960,00:11:54.160,You did.
00:11:56.920,00:11:58.280,You all... You all right?
00:11:59.560,00:12:01.040,You don't know what it's like.
00:12:03.120,00:12:05.040,You don't know what it's like out there.
00:12:05.840,00:12:07.720,"You may think you do, but you don't."
00:12:10.560,00:12:12.320,We'd have died out there.
00:12:14.680,00:12:16.520,It was only a matter of time.
00:12:17.280,00:12:18.560,There's too many of those things.
00:12:21.240,00:12:23.200,My... My boy...
00:12:27.080,00:12:28.520,"My wife, I never..."
00:12:31.520,00:12:33.480,I never told 'em what I really thought.
00:12:37.760,00:12:39.360,"I never even hinted, just..."
00:12:44.040,00:12:45.600,Just kept it in.
00:12:46.720,00:12:49.680,"Kept it in, kept us moving, you know?"
00:12:52.960,00:12:54.440,It'll all be okay.
00:12:57.600,00:12:59.040,It'll be okay.
00:13:14.320,00:13:16.160,Enough to keep us busy for years.
00:13:17.160,00:13:19.400,"All right. Come on, kids, it's bedtime."
00:13:20.520,00:13:22.560,"Baby, go say your prayers. I'm gonna browse a bit."
00:13:22.960,00:13:24.120,Come on.
00:13:24.720,00:13:27.360,This is the first night we might actually get some real sleep.
00:13:27.440,00:13:29.360,"-LORI: Hmm. -It's a miracle, isn't it?"
00:13:52.720,00:13:53.960,"Jesus, you scared me."
00:13:55.160,00:13:57.480,I'm gonna tell you a few things and you're gonna listen to me.
00:13:58.520,00:14:00.120,Now is not the time.
00:14:06.760,00:14:08.440,How can you treat me like this?
00:14:08.600,00:14:09.800,"-You're kidding, right? -No. Uh-uh."
00:14:09.880,00:14:11.720,Because you told me my husband was dead.
00:14:11.800,00:14:13.800,"Jesus, Lori, I didn't lie to you, all right? I didn't."
00:14:14.160,00:14:15.840,"Do you know what it was like there, huh?"
00:14:17.240,00:14:20.160,Stop. Things were falling apart.
00:14:20.520,00:14:22.440,They were slaughtering people in the hallways.
00:14:22.520,00:14:25.120,It was a massacre. There were walkers everywhere.
00:14:25.280,00:14:27.400,"-So, you left him? -Everybody else ran."
00:14:27.520,00:14:29.520,There were no doctors there. It was just me.
00:14:29.600,00:14:32.800,He was hooked up to machines and I did not know what to do.
00:14:33.200,00:14:37.480,I even took my ear and I put it on his chest and I listened for a heartbeat and I did not hear one.
00:14:39.160,00:14:42.840,"Maybe it was gunfire. I don't know what it was, but there was no way he could've survived that. No way."
00:14:43.000,00:14:44.320,-He did. -Yeah.
00:14:44.400,00:14:46.160,"But then I had y'all to think about, didn't I?"
00:14:46.280,00:14:48.560,"-I had you and Carl, and I needed... -Okay, no, no."
00:14:48.880,00:14:49.880,I had to get you guys safe to Atlanta.
00:14:50.000,00:14:51.480,That's what I had to do. Just stop it.
00:14:51.560,00:14:54.400,"If you thought for one second that he was still alive, would you have come?"
00:14:55.840,00:14:57.160,"So, I saved your life."
00:14:57.800,00:14:59.520,You and your little boy's. That's what I did.
00:14:59.600,00:15:00.600,Right?
00:15:02.520,00:15:03.520,Okay.
00:15:08.240,00:15:10.080,I would trade places with him right now because...
00:15:10.200,00:15:11.280,"-No, no, no... -No, no, no, you..."
00:15:11.360,00:15:12.440,No.
00:15:12.600,00:15:13.600,-I love you. -No...
00:15:13.720,00:15:15.200,"-Shh. I love you... -No. No, you're drunk."
00:15:15.320,00:15:17.600,"And I know... Now, here's the thing is, I think that you love me too."
00:15:17.680,00:15:20.360,Because there's no way that you could've been with me the way that you were.
00:15:20.440,00:15:21.760,"-Shane. Shane. Shane! -Just... Okay, stop."
00:15:21.840,00:15:23.640,"-Listen. You love me, too. -Get your hands off me."
00:15:23.800,00:15:25.520,"-Get your hands off me. -I said, I love you."
00:15:25.600,00:15:26.600,-There's nobody here. -Please! No!
00:15:26.680,00:15:28.840,"Stop, Lori. It's all right. Just..."
00:16:40.400,00:16:41.960,We're safe here.
00:16:43.120,00:16:44.160,All right?
00:16:55.840,00:16:57.040,Hello.
00:16:59.240,00:17:01.080,-Morning. -Are you hungover?
00:17:02.360,00:17:05.280,-Mom said you'd be. -Mom is right.
00:17:06.440,00:17:08.040,Mom has that annoying habit.
00:17:08.800,00:17:12.480,"Eggs! Powdered, but... But I do 'em good."
00:17:19.440,00:17:20.560,Where'd all this come from?
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.760,"-Jenner. -Could you help me, please?"
00:17:23.040,00:17:24.720,-He thought we could use it. -RICK: Thank you.
00:17:26.640,00:17:28.560,"Don't ever, ever, ever let me drink again."
00:17:29.120,00:17:30.560,-SHANE: Hey. -Hey.
00:17:33.320,00:17:34.560,Feel as bad as I do?
00:17:35.000,00:17:36.200,Worse.
00:17:38.560,00:17:40.160,The hell happened to you?
00:17:40.920,00:17:42.240,Your neck?
00:17:43.120,00:17:44.320,Must've done it in my sleep.
00:17:44.720,00:17:45.880,Never seen you do that before.
00:17:46.400,00:17:47.480,Me neither.
00:17:48.440,00:17:50.000,Not like me at all.
00:17:54.880,00:17:57.280,"-Morning. -SHANE: Hey, Doc."
00:17:59.000,00:18:00.920,"Doctor, I don't mean to slam you with questions first thing..."
00:18:01.320,00:18:02.560,But you will anyway.
00:18:03.000,00:18:04.520,We didn't come here for the eggs.
00:18:14.680,00:18:16.320,Give me playback of TS-19.
00:18:16.520,00:18:18.280,VI: Playback of TS-19.
00:18:20.840,00:18:23.160,JENNER: Few people ever got a chance to see this.
00:18:23.640,00:18:24.960,Very few.
00:18:31.440,00:18:32.600,Is that a brain?
00:18:33.120,00:18:34.360,An extraordinary one.
00:18:36.480,00:18:38.120,Not that it matters in the end.
00:18:38.640,00:18:40.120,Take us in for EIV.
00:18:40.320,00:18:42.200,VI: Enhanced internal view.
00:18:58.360,00:18:59.520,What are those lights?
00:19:01.480,00:19:02.840,JENNER: It's a person's life.
00:19:03.520,00:19:05.360,"Experiences, memories."
00:19:05.440,00:19:06.760,It's everything.
00:19:14.600,00:19:16.280,The thing that makes you unique.
00:19:17.320,00:19:18.520,And human.
00:19:19.400,00:19:21.040,You don't make sense ever?
00:19:21.400,00:19:26.360,"Those are synapses, electric impulses in the brain that carry all the messages."
00:19:26.800,00:19:34.640,"They determine everything a person says, does or thinks from the moment of birth -to the moment of death. -RICK: Death?"
00:19:35.200,00:19:36.800,"That's what this is, a vigil?"
00:19:37.360,00:19:38.440,Yes.
00:19:39.480,00:19:43.440,"Or rather, the playback of the vigil."
00:19:44.800,00:19:46.160,This person died?
00:19:47.880,00:19:49.120,Who?
00:19:50.080,00:19:51.520,Test Subject 19.
00:19:53.080,00:20:02.560,"Someone who was bitten and infected, and volunteered to have us record the process."
00:20:05.400,00:20:07.480,"Vi, scan forward to the first event."
00:20:17.040,00:20:18.240,What is that?
00:20:20.560,00:20:22.800,It invades the brain like meningitis.
00:20:24.360,00:20:29.920,"The adrenal glands hemorrhage, the brain goes into shutdown, then the major organs."
00:20:34.240,00:20:35.560,Then death.
00:20:37.520,00:20:42.680,"Everything you ever were or ever will be, gone."
00:20:44.400,00:20:45.960,Is that what happened to Jim?
00:20:46.680,00:20:47.800,Yes.
00:20:56.640,00:20:58.320,LORI: She lost somebody two days ago.
00:20:58.720,00:20:59.840,Her sister.
00:21:01.920,00:21:03.040,I lost somebody too.
00:21:10.600,00:21:12.360,Scan to the second event.
00:21:12.760,00:21:14.360,VI: Scanning to second event.
00:21:16.280,00:21:18.280,The resurrection times vary wildly.
00:21:18.360,00:21:21.360,We have reports of it happening in as little as three minutes.
00:21:22.520,00:21:24.160,The longest we heard of was eight hours.
00:21:25.120,00:21:31.920,"In the case of this patient, it was two hours, one minute, seven seconds."
00:21:42.640,00:21:44.000,It restarts the brain?
00:21:45.040,00:21:46.200,"No, just the brain stem."
00:21:47.160,00:21:49.360,"Basically, it gets them up and moving."
00:21:49.440,00:21:50.720,But they're not alive?
00:21:52.680,00:21:54.000,You tell me.
00:21:55.680,00:21:57.200,It's nothing like before.
00:21:57.720,00:21:59.640,Most of that brain is dark.
00:21:59.800,00:22:02.040,"JENNER: Dark, lifeless, dead."
00:22:02.520,00:22:05.840,"The frontal lobe, the neocortex, the human part, that doesn't come back. The you part."
00:22:08.240,00:22:12.200,Just a shell driven by mindless instinct.
00:22:14.960,00:22:16.680,God. What was that?
00:22:18.800,00:22:20.600,He shot his patient in the head.
00:22:23.440,00:22:24.560,Didn't you?
00:22:25.560,00:22:27.880,"Vi, power down the main screen and the workstations."
00:22:28.040,00:22:31.240,VI: Powering down main screen and workstations.
00:22:33.560,00:22:35.680,"You have no idea what it is, do you?"
00:22:38.560,00:22:43.040,"It could be microbial, viral, parasitic, fungal."
00:22:43.440,00:22:44.800,Or the wrath of God?
00:22:45.200,00:22:46.320,There is that.
00:22:48.280,00:22:50.200,Somebody must know something.
00:22:50.520,00:22:52.000,"Somebody, somewhere."
00:22:52.080,00:22:53.280,"There are others, right?"
00:22:53.360,00:22:54.880,Other facilities?
00:22:56.680,00:22:58.120,There may be some.
00:22:59.480,00:23:00.480,People like me.
00:23:00.800,00:23:02.840,But you don't know? How can you not know?
00:23:02.960,00:23:04.120,JENNER: Everything went down.
00:23:04.240,00:23:05.760,"Communications, directives, all of it."
00:23:06.200,00:23:08.600,I've been in the dark for almost a month.
00:23:09.560,00:23:11.160,"So, it's not just here."
00:23:11.560,00:23:14.080,There's nothing left anywhere? Nothing?
00:23:14.960,00:23:17.240,"That's what you're really saying, right?"
00:23:26.760,00:23:27.920,Jesus.
00:23:28.560,00:23:30.440,"Man, I'm gonna get shit-faced drunk again."
00:23:31.440,00:23:36.160,"Dr. Jenner, I know this has been taxing for you and I hate to ask one more question, but..."
00:23:37.560,00:23:38.920,That clock...
00:23:43.520,00:23:45.000,What happens at zero?
00:23:53.640,00:23:54.880,And then?
00:23:58.200,00:24:00.560,"Vi, what happens when the power runs out?"
00:24:01.560,00:24:06.040,"VI: When the power runs out, facility-wide decontamination will occur."
00:24:10.680,00:24:13.160,GLENN: Decontamination. What does that mean?
00:24:15.040,00:24:16.960,The way he just wandered off like that.
00:24:17.520,00:24:21.120,"What's wrong with him? Seriously, man, is he nuts, medicated, what?"
00:24:22.800,00:24:23.960,In there.
00:24:33.240,00:24:34.920,Check that way.
00:25:01.040,00:25:02.480,It's empty.
00:25:05.480,00:25:07.920,-VI: Emergency lighting on. -What the hell is this?
00:25:11.960,00:25:13.000,"Hey, you guys kill the lights?"
00:25:13.320,00:25:15.120,"-Nah, it just went out. -RICK: Anything?"
00:25:23.560,00:25:25.480,It can't be down to just that one.
00:25:33.280,00:25:34.320,Mom?
00:25:35.280,00:25:36.520,Something wrong?
00:25:37.600,00:25:39.400,"Uh, nothing. It's just..."
00:25:41.240,00:25:42.720,The air conditioning stopped.
00:26:00.240,00:26:02.400,I did the best I could in the time that I had.
00:26:05.080,00:26:07.080,I hope you'd be proud of that.
00:26:26.800,00:26:28.920,We always think there's gonna be more time.
00:26:34.520,00:26:35.880,Then it runs out.
00:26:38.680,00:26:41.000,-Why is the air off? -And the lights in our room?
00:26:41.120,00:26:42.840,What's going on? Why is everything turned off?
00:26:43.640,00:26:44.960,Energy use is being prioritized.
00:26:45.480,00:26:47.560,Air isn't a priority? And lights?
00:26:47.760,00:26:51.080,It's not up to me. Zone 5 is shutting itself down.
00:26:51.400,00:26:53.080,"Hey! Hey, what the hell does that mean?"
00:26:55.760,00:26:57.520,What do you mean it's shutting itself down?
00:26:57.920,00:26:59.240,How can a building do anything?
00:27:06.160,00:27:07.640,"Jenner, what's happening?"
00:27:07.880,00:27:10.560,The system is dropping all the nonessential uses of power.
00:27:11.120,00:27:13.880,It's designed to keep the computers running to the last possible second.
00:27:16.800,00:27:17.800,Right on schedule.
00:27:28.840,00:27:30.440,It was the French.
00:27:30.600,00:27:31.600,What?
00:27:31.680,00:27:33.360,They were the last ones to hold out as far as I know.
00:27:33.960,00:27:38.800,"While our people were bolting out the doors and committing suicide in the hallways, they stayed in the labs till the end."
00:27:39.360,00:27:41.560,They thought they were close to a solution.
00:27:41.800,00:27:42.800,What happened?
00:27:43.560,00:27:45.520,The same thing that's happening here.
00:27:46.400,00:27:47.800,No power grid.
00:27:49.080,00:27:50.200,Ran out of juice.
00:27:51.880,00:27:54.440,The world runs on fossil fuel.
00:27:57.240,00:27:58.320,"-Let me tell you... -To hell with it, Shane."
00:27:58.400,00:28:01.640,"I don't even care. Lori, grab our things. Everybody, get your stuff."
00:28:01.760,00:28:03.400,We're getting out of here now!
00:28:03.920,00:28:05.120,"Oh, okay."
00:28:09.680,00:28:11.000,What's that?
00:28:11.520,00:28:13.800,VI: 30 minutes to decontamination.
00:28:17.560,00:28:19.240,"DARYL: Doc, what's going on here, Doc?"
00:28:19.480,00:28:21.800,"Everybody, y'all heard Rick. Get your stuff! Let's go! Go, now!"
00:28:21.880,00:28:22.960,-Let's go. -GLENN: Come on!
00:28:29.680,00:28:30.960,Did you just lock us in?
00:28:31.640,00:28:32.920,He just locked us in!
00:28:33.800,00:28:35.480,We've hit the 30-minute window. I am recording.
00:28:37.400,00:28:38.520,-Carl. -Mom!
00:28:39.520,00:28:40.880,-You son of a bitch. -Shane!
00:28:41.000,00:28:42.720,"-You let us out of here! -No, stop! Don't!"
00:28:43.920,00:28:45.480,"-You lying... -SHANE: No, no, no!"
00:28:45.720,00:28:47.240,"Wait, no! No, don't do it."
00:28:50.160,00:28:52.320,"Hey, Jenner, open that door now."
00:28:52.400,00:28:54.640,There's no point. Everything topside is locked down.
00:28:54.720,00:28:56.040,The emergency exits are sealed.
00:28:56.120,00:28:57.400,"DALE: Well, open the damn things."
00:28:57.880,00:28:59.400,That's not something I control. The computers do.
00:29:01.360,00:29:03.080,"Once that front door closed, it wouldn't open again."
00:29:03.160,00:29:04.480,You heard me say that.
00:29:07.560,00:29:09.200,-It's better this way. -What is?
00:29:09.520,00:29:11.520,What happens in 28 minutes?
00:29:19.160,00:29:23.880,We protected the public from very nasty stuff!
00:29:25.720,00:29:27.840,Weaponized smallpox!
00:29:28.240,00:29:31.080,Ebola strains that could wipe out half the country!
00:29:31.360,00:29:32.960,Stuff you don't want getting out!
00:29:33.080,00:29:34.400,Ever!
00:29:46.760,00:29:55.000,"In the event of a catastrophic power failure, in a terrorist attack, for example, HITs are deployed to prevent any organisms from getting out."
00:29:55.200,00:29:56.280,HITs?
00:29:58.760,00:30:12.880,"-Vi, define. -VI: HITs, high-impulse thermobaric fuel-air explosives, consists of a two-stage aerosol ignition that produces a blast wave of significantly greater power and duration than any other known explosive except nuclear."
00:30:12.960,00:30:22.480,"The vacuum-pressure effect ignites the oxygen between 5,000 and 6,000 degrees and is useful where the greatest loss of life and damage to structures is desired."
00:30:23.520,00:30:24.760,It sets the air on fire.
00:30:29.080,00:30:30.240,No pain.
00:30:31.880,00:30:34.160,"An end to sorrow, grief."
00:30:36.200,00:30:37.240,Regret.
00:30:46.120,00:30:47.480,Everything.
00:30:53.880,00:30:56.000,Open the damn door!
00:30:57.520,00:30:58.920,Out of my way!
00:31:08.960,00:31:10.480,You should've left well enough alone.
00:31:10.680,00:31:12.360,It would've been so much easier.
00:31:12.440,00:31:14.080,-Easier for who? -JENNER: All of you.
00:31:14.280,00:31:15.320,You know what's out there.
00:31:22.240,00:31:23.680,-What was her name? -Amy.
00:31:23.760,00:31:24.840,JENNER: Amy.
00:31:25.280,00:31:26.920,You know what this does.
00:31:27.160,00:31:28.240,You've seen it.
00:31:28.400,00:31:30.480,Is that really what you want for your wife and son?
00:31:30.560,00:31:32.600,I don't want this.
00:31:35.520,00:31:37.560,Those doors are designed to withstand a rocket launcher.
00:31:37.720,00:31:39.560,"-Well, your head ain't! -Whoa! Whoa!"
00:31:39.720,00:31:41.080,Daryl! Daryl!
00:31:41.800,00:31:44.320,Just back up! Back up!
00:31:45.240,00:31:47.280,JENNER: You do want this.
00:31:47.520,00:31:52.120,"Last night, you said you knew it was just a matter of time before everybody you loved was dead."
00:31:52.480,00:31:53.560,What?
00:31:56.640,00:31:58.040,What? You really said that?
00:31:58.600,00:31:59.840,After all your big talk?
00:31:59.920,00:32:01.200,"I had to keep hope alive, didn't I?"
00:32:01.520,00:32:02.920,JENNER: There is no hope.
00:32:03.200,00:32:05.040,-There never was. -There's always hope.
00:32:05.120,00:32:08.760,"Maybe it won't be you, maybe not here, but somebody somewhere..."
00:32:08.920,00:32:11.000,What part of everything is gone do you not understand?
00:32:11.480,00:32:13.280,JENNER: Listen to your friend. She gets it.
00:32:13.800,00:32:15.720,This is what takes us down.
00:32:16.840,00:32:19.720,This is our extinction event.
00:32:24.480,00:32:25.920,CAROL: This isn't right.
00:32:26.320,00:32:28.280,You can't just keep us here.
00:32:28.960,00:32:30.760,"One tiny moment, it..."
00:32:31.080,00:32:32.960,A millisecond. No pain.
00:32:33.080,00:32:35.880,My daughter doesn't deserve to die like this.
00:32:39.520,00:32:46.280,"Wouldn't it be kinder, more compassionate, to just hold your loved ones and wait for the clock to run down?"
00:32:48.400,00:32:49.760,"-Shane, no! -Out of the way, Rick!"
00:32:50.000,00:32:54.000,Stay out of my way! Open that door or I'm gonna blow your head off. Do you hear me?
00:32:54.400,00:32:59.360,"Brother, brother, this is not the way. You do this, -we will never get out of here. -Shane, you listen to him."
00:32:59.800,00:33:00.920,It's too late.
00:33:01.240,00:33:02.760,"-He dies, we all... -Ahhh!"
00:33:06.400,00:33:07.600,Argh!
00:33:09.800,00:33:11.120,Shane!
00:33:23.440,00:33:24.760,"Yeah, I guess we all are."
00:33:46.480,00:33:47.600,I think you're lying.
00:33:50.600,00:33:54.760,-What? -RICK: You're lying about no hope.
00:33:56.400,00:34:00.560,"If that were true, you'd have bolted with the rest or taken the easy way out. You didn't."
00:34:02.560,00:34:04.000,You chose the hard path.
00:34:04.200,00:34:05.880,-Why? -It doesn't matter.
00:34:06.320,00:34:08.640,It does matter. It always matters.
00:34:09.080,00:34:11.880,You stayed when others ran. Why?
00:34:12.240,00:34:14.440,Not because I wanted to.
00:34:14.920,00:34:16.440,I made a promise.
00:34:18.360,00:34:19.720,To her.
00:34:20.840,00:34:22.000,My wife.
00:34:25.000,00:34:27.000,Test Subject 19 was your wife?
00:34:28.240,00:34:30.920,She begged me to keep going as long as I could.
00:34:34.880,00:34:36.280,She was dying.
00:34:37.560,00:34:39.080,It should've been me on that table.
00:34:39.400,00:34:40.480,I wouldn't have mattered to anybody.
00:34:40.560,00:34:42.880,She was a loss to the world.
00:34:43.680,00:34:45.320,"Hell, she ran this place. I just worked here."
00:34:46.280,00:34:48.680,"In our field, she was an Einstein."
00:34:50.080,00:34:53.160,Me? I'm just... Edwin Jenner.
00:34:56.560,00:34:57.720,Not me.
00:34:58.680,00:35:00.920,Your wife didn't have a choice.
00:35:01.400,00:35:04.800,You do. That's... That's all we want.
00:35:06.160,00:35:08.480,"A choice, a chance."
00:35:10.680,00:35:13.160,Let us keep trying as long as we can.
00:35:20.760,00:35:23.280,I told you topside's locked down. I can't open those.
00:35:39.240,00:35:40.560,"-Let's go! -Come on, let's go!"
00:35:40.680,00:35:42.520,-Come on! -Move it! Move it!
00:35:43.000,00:35:44.080,"DARYL: Come on, let's go!"
00:35:44.160,00:35:45.600,"CAROL: We're gonna get out of here, Sophia."
00:35:46.040,00:35:47.320,There's your chance. Take it.
00:35:47.800,00:35:49.200,I'm grateful.
00:35:50.080,00:35:51.800,-The day will come when you won't be. -GLENN: Let's go!
00:36:06.480,00:36:08.240,"Hey, we've got four minutes left! Come on!"
00:36:08.560,00:36:10.960,"-Let's go. Let's go. -No. No, I'm staying."
00:36:11.440,00:36:12.720,"I'm staying, sweetie."
00:36:13.160,00:36:15.320,"-But that's insane! -No, it's completely sane."
00:36:15.400,00:36:16.880,For the first time in a long time.
00:36:17.880,00:36:19.840,I'm not ending up like Jim and Amy.
00:36:22.960,00:36:26.680,"There's no time to argue and no point, not if you want to get out."
00:36:29.880,00:36:32.000,"Hey, Dog. Come on, man."
00:36:32.240,00:36:33.840,Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
00:36:41.120,00:36:42.400,I'm staying too.
00:36:44.160,00:36:45.560,"Andrea, no."
00:36:49.120,00:36:51.000,-Just go! Go! -Come on.
00:36:59.120,00:37:03.840,"Andrea, this isn't what Amy would want for you."
00:37:04.480,00:37:06.960,"She's dead, and you need to leave."
00:37:13.960,00:37:15.520,-Get them doors open! -Come on!
00:37:16.640,00:37:19.080,-It doesn't work! -Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
00:37:19.160,00:37:21.280,Try it! Try it! Try it now!
00:37:24.920,00:37:26.640,"-Come on! Come on! -Stay close, sweetheart."
00:37:31.160,00:37:32.480,Time's almost up.
00:37:34.160,00:37:36.720,"Daryl, look out! Ahhh!"
00:37:37.240,00:37:38.280,Ahhh!
00:37:40.360,00:37:41.360,Ahhh!
00:37:43.880,00:37:45.360,"Dog, get down! Get down!"
00:37:49.240,00:37:50.440,-Jesus. -SOPHIA: The glass won't break?
00:37:52.160,00:37:53.800,"Rick, I have something that might help."
00:37:55.320,00:37:57.000,"Carol, I don't think a nail file's gonna do it."
00:37:57.280,00:38:01.880,"Your first morning at camp, when I washed your uniform, I found this in your pocket."
00:38:05.240,00:38:06.440,Come on.
00:38:06.720,00:38:08.120,Look out!
00:38:16.280,00:38:17.720,Oh...
00:38:27.880,00:38:29.080,Okay.
00:38:30.760,00:38:32.080,You win.
00:38:39.760,00:38:42.400,"-What are you doing? -I said, Okay."
00:38:45.000,00:38:47.840,"-Don't pull this, Dale. -I'm not pulling anything."
00:38:47.960,00:38:49.560,"If you're staying, I stay too."
00:38:50.800,00:38:53.280,He's right. We know what's waiting for us out there.
00:38:53.680,00:38:55.200,I don't want to face it alone.
00:38:56.600,00:38:58.400,"Dale, get the hell out."
00:38:59.360,00:39:01.440,-I don't want you here. -Too bad.
00:39:01.880,00:39:03.560,"See, you don't get to do that, to..."
00:39:03.760,00:39:08.160,"To come into somebody's life, make them care and then just check out."
00:39:13.760,00:39:15.240,I'm staying.
00:39:17.480,00:39:19.080,The matter is settled.
00:39:49.240,00:39:51.360,"Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait! They're coming."
00:40:03.120,00:40:04.400,They got out.
00:40:24.720,00:40:26.520,"Dale, get down! Down!"
00:40:27.080,00:40:29.720,Get back! Everybody down! Down!
00:40:32.640,00:40:33.760,Get down!
00:41:27.000,00:41:29.400,Come on. Come on.
00:41:32.480,00:41:33.960,"Come on. Come on. Get in, get in, get in!"
00:41:34.480,00:41:35.560,Get in!
