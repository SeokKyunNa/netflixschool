00:01:06.734,00:01:09.403,"BOY: Move it, dorkus."
00:01:11.864,00:01:13.908,"MAN: Okay, I think you're next."
00:01:13.908,00:01:15.701,I'll take your ticket.
00:01:15.701,00:01:18.119,Just come right around this way just a little bit.
00:01:18.119,00:01:19.454,Keep your back straight.
00:01:19.454,00:01:21.081,"Put your books down on your lap, okay?"
00:01:21.081,00:01:22.791,"Now look right up at the camera, okay?"
00:01:22.791,00:01:25.252,Nice smile. There we go.
00:01:25.252,00:01:26.962,Let me focus right over here.
00:01:26.962,00:01:29.548,Okay. That's good.
00:01:29.548,00:01:31.508,"Swing around this way just a little bit, Gina."
00:01:31.508,00:01:32.968,"Come on, right there."
00:01:32.968,00:01:34.469,It's Jenna.
00:01:34.469,00:01:37.264,Right here.
00:01:48.692,00:01:50.402,"Oh, God."
00:01:52.153,00:01:54.406,"Oh, no."
00:02:13.508,00:02:15.176,"Hey, Jenna."
00:02:15.176,00:02:17.096,"Matt, please."
00:02:17.096,00:02:19.098,Come on.
00:02:19.098,00:02:21.892,We got to document it.
00:02:31.068,00:02:32.527,"Hi, Tom-Tom."
00:02:32.527,00:02:34.738,"Hey, Jenna. Hi, Beaver."
00:02:34.738,00:02:36.573,How's everything at the dam?
00:02:37.992,00:02:39.994,"So how'd yours come out, Rink?"
00:02:39.994,00:02:41.369,"Uh, not too good."
00:02:41.369,00:02:43.622,"Yeah, mine aren't so hot either."
00:02:43.622,00:02:44.915,"Tom-Tom, yours are great."
00:02:44.915,00:02:46.625,Yours are the best.
00:02:46.625,00:02:49.920,"God, you're so photogenic."
00:02:49.920,00:02:52.506,"I'll meet you out front, okay?"
00:02:52.506,00:02:54.716,It's not like she needs a play-by-play.
00:02:57.260,00:02:58.595,Freakazoid.
00:02:58.595,00:03:00.388,See ya.
00:03:00.388,00:03:04.101,"Uh, Jenna, could I talk to you a tiny sec?"
00:03:05.477,00:03:11.358,"So, I told Chris Grandy me and the Six Chicks were going to your party tonight, and he said he wanted to come with."
00:03:11.358,00:03:12.776,Really?
00:03:12.776,00:03:16.780,"Yeah, it's too bad we can't make it, because we really wanted to."
00:03:16.780,00:03:18.032,We totally did.
00:03:18.032,00:03:19.658,GIRL: We're so sorry.
00:03:19.658,00:03:28.333,"Yeah, Miss Measly's totally up our butts with this group project proposal, and Chris is gonna come over and help us out, so I guess he can't come either."
00:03:30.002,00:03:31.879,I could write your report for you.
00:03:31.879,00:03:34.339,Fabuloso!
00:03:43.015,00:03:46.309,"You know, I can't believe you invited those clones."
00:03:46.309,00:03:47.978,They're my friends.
00:03:47.978,00:03:50.689,"The Six Chicks are not your friends, okay?"
00:03:50.689,00:03:53.734,"Well, almost, and some day, I'm gonna be a Six Chick."
00:03:53.734,00:03:55.944,"There's six of them, Jenna. That's the whole point."
00:03:55.944,00:03:57.571,There can't be a seventh Six Chick.
00:03:57.571,00:03:59.406,It's just mathematically impossible.
00:03:59.406,00:04:01.158,"Besides, you're way cooler than they are."
00:04:01.158,00:04:02.492,They're totally unoriginal.
00:04:02.492,00:04:04.119,"I don't want to be original, Matty."
00:04:04.119,00:04:06.580,I want to be cool.
00:04:06.580,00:04:07.831,Want some Razzles?
00:04:07.831,00:04:09.875,Razzles are for kids.
00:04:09.875,00:04:12.002,Exactly.
00:04:16.215,00:04:17.507,Arrivederci.
00:04:17.507,00:04:19.218,Au revoir.
00:05:00.050,00:05:01.760,"Hey, sweetie."
00:05:01.760,00:05:04.263,"Tell us about your new life as a teenager, Jenna!"
00:05:04.263,00:05:05.597,What did you do?
00:05:05.597,00:05:07.015,Are you wearing a bra?
00:05:07.015,00:05:08.225,Go away!
00:05:08.225,00:05:10.435,"DAD: Oh, honey, what's wrong?"
00:05:10.435,00:05:12.437,Wayne. Self-image.
00:05:12.437,00:05:14.982,Huh? Oh.
00:05:12.437,00:05:16.191,"Jenna, it's going to be all right."
00:05:16.191,00:05:17.609,"It is not, Mom!"
00:05:17.609,00:05:19.778,This is not okay.
00:05:19.778,00:05:22.239,"It's not fatal, honey."
00:05:22.239,00:05:23.740,I hate my life.
00:05:23.740,00:05:29.788,Just because you don't look like these girls in Poise Magazine doesn't mean that you're not beautiful in your own way.
00:05:29.788,00:05:31.706,I don't want to be beautiful in my own way.
00:05:31.706,00:05:34.668,I want to look like these people.
00:05:34.668,00:05:37.838,"Oh, those aren't people, honey."
00:05:37.838,00:05:40.090,"Thirty, flirty and thriving."
00:05:40.090,00:05:43.677,Why the 30s are the best years of your life.
00:05:43.677,00:05:45.304,I want to be 30.
00:05:45.304,00:05:50.976,"Well, you will be, honey, but right now, you're my beautiful 13-year-old."
00:06:22.257,00:06:24.551,"Happy birthday, Jenna."
00:06:24.551,00:06:26.136,This is just part one of your present.
00:06:26.136,00:06:28.722,I got something else to give you later.
00:06:28.722,00:06:30.431,What is it?
00:06:30.431,00:06:34.144,You know how you always wanted a Barbie Dream House?
00:06:34.144,00:06:35.436,Mm-hmm.
00:06:35.436,00:06:36.771,Well...
00:06:36.771,00:06:39.191,I decided to make you your own...
00:06:39.191,00:06:41.902,Jenna Dream House.
00:06:44.612,00:06:46.781,You made all this?
00:06:46.781,00:06:49.284,"Oh, Matty."
00:06:49.284,00:06:55.623,"See, that's you in your bubble bath reading your favorite magazine, and, uh..."
00:06:55.623,00:07:03.382,"there's your bedroom, with a massive stereo and every record ever made-- the good ones-- and, uh..."
00:07:03.382,00:07:07.594,"there's that bum, Rick Springfield, loafing on the couch..."
00:07:09.137,00:07:13.975,and there I am to make sure the creep keeps his hands to himself.
00:07:13.975,00:07:16.353,Oh. Almost forgot.
00:07:16.353,00:07:18.688,Wishing Dust.
00:07:18.688,00:07:22.984,"It says, uh, This wishing dust knows what's in your heart of hearts."
00:07:22.984,00:07:26.363,It'll make all your dreams come true.
00:07:46.091,00:07:48.969,"Um, they're here."
00:07:48.969,00:07:50.929,What do we do?
00:07:50.929,00:07:52.139,"Um, um..."
00:07:52.139,00:07:54.182,"Oh, my God."
00:07:54.182,00:07:56.101,"Matt, I'm just gonna put this away, okay?"
00:07:56.101,00:07:58.228,So there's room to dance.
00:08:00.981,00:08:02.357,Put some music on.
00:08:05.944,00:08:08.071,"Dad, you promised you were gonna stay upstairs."
00:08:08.071,00:08:09.906,Go!
00:08:12.826,00:08:14.119,"Hi, guys."
00:08:14.119,00:08:15.912,The party's downstairs.
00:08:25.464,00:08:28.300,Fabuloso.
00:09:12.219,00:09:13.594,What is this?
00:09:13.594,00:09:14.929,I'm not sure.
00:09:24.898,00:09:27.067,"Sorry, Beave-head."
00:09:29.069,00:09:31.112,"Narrow, man."
00:09:31.112,00:09:33.448,"Narrow, hopeless people."
00:09:33.448,00:09:36.493,Freak.
00:09:40.205,00:09:42.957,I'm gonna go next door and get my Casio.
00:09:42.957,00:09:44.625,"Do whatever you want, Matt."
00:09:44.625,00:09:46.920,It's not like I need a play-by-play.
00:09:48.088,00:09:50.715,"GIRL: See you, loser."
00:09:55.512,00:09:57.305,"Hey, I have an idea, girls."
00:09:57.305,00:10:03.395,"Let's play Seven Minutes in Heaven, and you can go first, because you're the birthday girl."
00:10:03.395,00:10:04.771,How does that one go again?
00:10:04.771,00:10:11.403,"TOM-TOM: Well, you go in the closet, and some lucky guy's gonna go in there and do whatever he wants with you..."
00:10:11.403,00:10:16.657,"for seven whole minutes, and guess who wants to go first?"
00:10:16.657,00:10:18.910,Who?
00:10:18.910,00:10:21.913,No way.
00:10:28.920,00:10:32.090,"Um, before I forget, where's our project proposal?"
00:10:32.090,00:10:34.468,On the table.
00:10:34.468,00:10:37.971,"Remember, no peeking."
00:10:34.468,00:10:42.476,"Keep that blindfold on, and just so you know, Chris loves going for second base."
00:10:53.361,00:10:54.862,Let's go.
00:10:54.862,00:10:56.656,I think I can get my brother to buy us some beer.
00:11:05.290,00:11:06.707,I got the Cheese Doodles.
00:11:06.707,00:11:09.169,"Wait, give me that drink. Thank you."
00:11:09.169,00:11:10.337,"Come on, we're out of here."
00:11:10.337,00:11:12.130,"Leave it, George."
00:11:13.672,00:11:15.383,What's going on?
00:11:15.383,00:11:18.886,"Uh, Jenna's waiting for you in the closet."
00:11:39.491,00:11:41.535,I thought you weren't gonna come.
00:11:49.376,00:11:52.045,Where are you?
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.553,"Oh, Chris."
00:11:59.553,00:12:02.138,It's not Chris. It's Matt.
00:12:02.138,00:12:05.724,What are you doing here?
00:12:05.724,00:12:08.186,He's gone. Everybody left.
00:12:10.771,00:12:11.939,What'd you do?
00:12:11.939,00:12:13.567,Nothing.
00:12:13.567,00:12:15.652,"No, I just went next door to get my Casio."
00:12:15.652,00:12:17.028,Get out!
00:12:17.028,00:12:18.655,Just let me talk to you!
00:12:18.655,00:12:20.574,"Jenna, please!"
00:12:20.574,00:12:23.326,I hate you!
00:12:23.326,00:12:25.912,"Jenna, what are you talking about?"
00:12:25.912,00:12:27.205,I want to be 30!
00:12:27.205,00:12:28.831,"Just let me play you this song, okay?"
00:12:28.831,00:12:31.918,It'll make you feel better.
00:12:31.918,00:12:33.712,Thirty and flirty and thriving!
00:12:36.256,00:12:39.967,Thirty and flirty and thriving.
00:12:39.967,00:12:42.387,Thirty and flirty and thriving.
00:12:42.387,00:12:44.556,Thirty and flirty and thriving.
00:12:44.556,00:12:47.350,Thirty and flirty and thriving.
00:12:47.350,00:12:49.728,Thirty and flirty and thriving.
00:12:49.728,00:12:52.564,Thirty and flirty and thriving...
00:13:29.392,00:13:32.228,Ow.
00:13:46.409,00:13:48.286,Mom?
00:13:56.085,00:13:58.713,Mom?
00:14:01.466,00:14:03.426,Dad?
00:14:16.606,00:14:19.734,Whoa!
00:14:48.847,00:14:50.765,What is happening?
00:14:53.976,00:14:55.395,"Oh, what is happening?"
00:14:55.395,00:14:57.522,What is going on?
00:15:11.661,00:15:14.706,Jenna Rink.
00:15:14.706,00:15:17.500,Jenna Rink. Jenna Rink.
00:15:17.500,00:15:19.878,Jenna Rink. Jenna Rink.
00:15:19.878,00:15:22.338,I live here.
00:15:27.218,00:15:28.803,WAYNE: Hi. Sorry we missed your call.
00:15:28.803,00:15:31.055,Dad?
00:15:28.803,00:15:36.436,"Well, we're not that sorry, because we're cruising in the Caribbean, so we'll be back on the 18th, so call us then."
00:15:36.436,00:15:41.023,You went on a cruise without me?
00:15:42.650,00:15:44.402,"Oh, this is a dream."
00:15:44.402,00:15:47.154,This is a really weird dream.
00:16:07.091,00:16:08.509,"Hey, Sweet Bottom!"
00:16:18.686,00:16:23.274,"I know you're there, and my parents are totally gonna be home any minute!"
00:16:24.734,00:16:26.861,"Hey, Sweet Bottom."
00:16:26.861,00:16:28.529,You're naked!
00:16:28.529,00:16:30.281,"Well, not yet."
00:16:33.409,00:16:36.245,MAN: You can join me if you want!
00:16:38.122,00:16:40.541,Sweet Bottom!
00:16:45.922,00:16:47.924,"Can you hear that, sir?"
00:16:47.924,00:16:49.342,WOMAN: Jenna!
00:16:49.342,00:16:50.969,"Can you hurry up a little bit, please?"
00:16:50.969,00:16:52.219,He made a commitment!
00:16:52.219,00:16:54.054,Jenna? Can you come over here?
00:16:54.054,00:16:56.641,I don't care if you have to grab him by his testicles.
00:16:56.641,00:16:59.268,I want him in New York in 12 hours.
00:16:59.268,00:17:00.854,He needs to be at the party.
00:17:00.854,00:17:02.522,Hold on a second.
00:17:02.522,00:17:04.607,I don't get in the car with strangers.
00:17:04.607,00:17:06.776,Please get in the car.
00:17:06.776,00:17:08.778,I can't. I don't know you.
00:17:08.778,00:17:10.363,I don't get in the car with strangers!
00:17:10.363,00:17:11.865,You're being paranoid.
00:17:11.865,00:17:13.449,"MAN: Hey, Sweet Bottom!"
00:17:13.449,00:17:15.284,Don't make me come down there and grab you.
00:17:15.284,00:17:17.161,Lucy Wyman.
00:17:17.161,00:17:18.872,Could you get in the car?
00:17:18.872,00:17:20.707,Jenna!
00:17:20.707,00:17:23.376,"Look, just-- He made a commitment."
00:17:23.376,00:17:25.628,He has my number.
00:17:25.628,00:17:28.088,Just go away!
00:17:30.049,00:17:34.387,"Honey, I know I'm your best friend, but the slip dress is a little '97."
00:17:34.387,00:17:35.930,Unless it's retro.
00:17:35.930,00:17:38.016,Are you really my best friend?
00:17:38.016,00:17:39.600,You're pregnant.
00:17:39.600,00:17:40.852,"No! Oh, my God, no!"
00:17:40.852,00:17:43.354,Thank God. You scared me.
00:17:43.354,00:17:44.689,What did you do last night?
00:17:44.689,00:17:46.065,"See, that's the thing."
00:17:46.065,00:17:48.067,Something really strange is happening.
00:17:48.067,00:17:50.778,I slept in an apartment I've never seen before...
00:17:50.778,00:17:53.072,"and there was a naked man in my shower, and I..."
00:17:53.072,00:17:54.407,I saw his thingy!
00:17:54.407,00:17:56.116,"Oh, God. Not his thingy."
00:17:56.116,00:18:00.454,"Driver, could you please pull over, since we're here? Stop!"
00:18:00.454,00:18:03.666,Wait. I don't want to get out of the-- I don't think you're listening.
00:18:03.666,00:18:06.210,Wait. Hang on.
00:18:06.210,00:18:09.213,Please listen to me. I'm 13!
00:18:09.213,00:18:12.592,"Jenna, if you're gonna start lying about your age, I'd go with 27."
00:18:11.340,00:18:17.638,"That's just-- Wait, I know it sounds strange, but, like, some weird dream-- Like that! Do you hear it?"
00:18:17.638,00:18:20.182,Did you hear that?
00:18:20.182,00:18:22.727,It's probably just Richard.
00:18:24.020,00:18:25.438,Who's Richard?
00:18:25.438,00:18:27.147,You drink too much.
00:18:27.147,00:18:28.942,"Richard, your boss."
00:18:28.942,00:18:30.735,"Brown, curly hair."
00:18:30.735,00:18:32.695,British. Richard.
00:18:32.695,00:18:34.822,Hello?
00:18:34.822,00:18:37.825,You! You.
00:18:34.822,00:18:39.243,Put on your pants and stop calling me Sweet Bottom.
00:18:39.243,00:18:41.412,"Baby, I-- And get out of my house!"
00:18:41.412,00:18:43.039,"Hey, look, I-- Who is that?"
00:18:43.039,00:18:44.331,I don't know his name.
00:18:44.331,00:18:45.792,I don't know what's happening.
00:18:45.792,00:18:47.085,I don't know what to do.
00:18:47.085,00:18:49.462,"Okay, Jenna. Jenna."
00:18:49.462,00:18:51.965,"We have a meeting in 10 minutes, okay?"
00:18:51.965,00:18:54.174,I'm gonna tell you what to do.
00:18:54.174,00:18:56.928,"I am Jenna Rink, big time magazine editor."
00:18:56.928,00:18:58.679,I am?
00:18:58.679,00:19:00.598,Repeat it.
00:19:00.598,00:19:04.727,"I am Jenna Rink, big time magazine editor."
00:19:04.727,00:19:06.186,I'm a tough bitch.
00:19:09.607,00:19:11.484,Say it!
00:19:11.484,00:19:12.652,I am a tough...
00:19:12.652,00:19:13.903,bitch.
00:19:13.903,00:19:20.118,"I'm gonna walk into that office, I'm not gonna let anyone know I'm hung over-- But that's not the point."
00:19:20.118,00:19:23.621,I'm gonna walk into that office and not let anyone know I'm hung over.
00:19:23.621,00:19:28.292,Because the future of Poise depends on me.
00:19:28.292,00:19:31.337,Poise?
00:19:32.588,00:19:34.674,"Oh, jeez."
00:19:39.178,00:19:40.930,Poise Magazine. Thank you.
00:19:40.930,00:19:43.141,"Good morning, Miss Rink."
00:19:43.141,00:19:44.934,Good morning.
00:19:44.934,00:19:47.020,Who cares?
00:19:47.020,00:19:51.899,"Please don't yell at me, because it's not my fault, but they came in late and they need a decision now."
00:19:51.899,00:19:54.234,Just pick one.
00:19:54.234,00:19:55.611,Love. Knew it. Genius.
00:19:55.611,00:19:56.946,"Uh, Eminem's on the phone."
00:19:56.946,00:19:58.489,He wants a decision now.
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.199,Plain.
00:20:02.118,00:20:03.494,Peanut.
00:20:03.494,00:20:04.954,"Uh, plain!"
00:20:04.954,00:20:06.664,RICHARD: There's the dynamic duo!
00:20:06.664,00:20:12.170,I trust my executive editors are late again because they were out promoting us at all the right parties?
00:20:12.170,00:20:13.337,"You got it, Richard."
00:20:13.337,00:20:15.048,Richard...
00:20:15.048,00:20:17.633,"That's right, baby."
00:20:17.633,00:20:18.968,Wayne Rink.
00:20:18.968,00:20:21.012,RICHARD: Morning.
00:20:24.431,00:20:27.143,Two words.
00:20:27.143,00:20:29.937,"Oh, you're not gonna go to Fire Island this summer?"
00:20:29.937,00:20:31.480,MAN: Are you insinuating I'm gay?
00:20:31.480,00:20:33.024,LUCY: It's a joke.
00:20:33.024,00:20:34.984,MAN: I think you should wear the Gucci.
00:20:34.984,00:20:37.236,It looks better on you.
00:20:41.407,00:20:45.619,"Is there anything else you need from me, Miss Rink?"
00:20:47.205,00:20:49.207,You mean like a favor?
00:20:49.207,00:20:52.710,"Uh, sure. Like a favor."
00:20:52.710,00:20:54.170,"Actually, I need to find this guy."
00:20:54.170,00:20:55.462,He lives in New Jersey.
00:20:55.462,00:20:57.090,I have his number.
00:21:00.885,00:21:02.678,"Arlene, will you leave us, please?"
00:21:02.678,00:21:05.223,Sorry.
00:21:13.689,00:21:15.900,Jenna's a little hung over today.
00:21:15.900,00:21:17.193,ALL: Oh...
00:21:17.193,00:21:18.569,MAN: Rough.
00:21:20.446,00:21:22.281,"Okay, children."
00:21:33.251,00:21:34.961,Hmm.
00:21:34.961,00:21:39.215,I wonder which one Holly Housewife is going to go for.
00:21:39.215,00:21:42.135,The 10th or the 11th secret.
00:21:51.811,00:21:55.106,"Seven months in a row now, they scoop us."
00:21:55.106,00:21:56.816,"I mean, it's like they've got..."
00:21:56.816,00:21:59.860,Sparkle cams hidden in all our walls.
00:21:59.860,00:22:09.787,"LUCY: Richard, we're installing passwords, we're building firewalls on all the computers, Jenna fired Charlotte yesterday-- Did you?"
00:22:09.787,00:22:11.914,Good. I guarantee you she has friends at Sparkle.
00:22:11.914,00:22:14.208,She was always taking notes.
00:22:14.208,00:22:16.961,"Yeah, whatever."
00:22:16.961,00:22:19.713,Our party tonight is now huge.
00:22:19.713,00:22:26.220,We need to make an unequivocal statement that Poise is still hot and happening.
00:22:26.220,00:22:29.015,"Now, we need a newsstand circ analysis done immediately."
00:22:29.015,00:22:34.937,"I also strongly suggest we take apart our F.O.B., overhaul the B.O.B., think about new heads, decks, and slugs."
00:22:34.937,00:22:36.563,"Jenna, what do you think?"
00:22:38.149,00:22:39.900,Can I go to the bathroom?
00:23:08.971,00:23:11.891,It's the naked guy.
00:23:20.566,00:23:23.401,"Jenna girl, Margaritas anytime."
00:23:23.401,00:23:26.072,"Love you, Madonna."
00:23:26.072,00:23:28.074,I'm friends with Madonna?
00:23:37.041,00:23:42.129,"Uh, here are your messages, and this morning your mother called from Barbados."
00:23:42.129,00:23:43.672,I wish you'd told me.
00:23:43.672,00:23:46.008,"Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Rink."
00:23:46.008,00:23:49.262,I thought you said never to bother you with family calls.
00:23:49.262,00:23:51.180,I did? I said that?
00:23:51.180,00:23:52.806,Please don't fire me.
00:23:52.806,00:23:54.934,"No, no, I won't."
00:23:54.934,00:23:57.435,I forgot that I said that.
00:23:54.934,00:23:59.855,"Next time my mom calls, will you please let me know?"
00:23:59.855,00:24:03.943,"Oh, um, I have that information that you asked for."
00:24:03.943,00:24:05.986,Matt.
00:24:05.986,00:24:09.156,"Um, the phone number that you gave me was his parents'."
00:24:09.156,00:24:12.576,I told them that I worked for Visa and he is in a lot of trouble.
00:24:12.576,00:24:15.246,You lied to the Flamhaffs?
00:24:15.246,00:24:16.747,He's in the Village.
00:24:16.747,00:24:20.209,"212 Bank Street, Apartment 2B."
00:24:20.209,00:24:21.585,Which village?
00:24:21.585,00:24:23.921,The...
00:24:23.921,00:24:26.506,Oh. Right.
00:24:26.506,00:24:28.592,"Oh, wait!"
00:24:28.592,00:24:30.594,Should I cancel your 2:30 meeting?
00:24:34.890,00:24:36.516,Sorry.
00:24:38.311,00:24:39.686,Excuse me!
00:24:41.021,00:24:43.690,Sir?
00:24:45.901,00:24:47.027,Hello?
00:25:13.720,00:25:15.473,"MAN: Yeah, yeah. Hello, yeah."
00:25:15.473,00:25:25.441,"Um, hi, this is Jenna, and I'm looking for Matt, and I don't know if you're the right Matt, but if you used to live on Spruce Street and if your favorite shirt is the gray velour one, then I need to speak to you right now."
00:25:25.441,00:25:27.276,Hello? Hello?
00:25:27.276,00:25:29.403,You know what?
00:25:29.403,00:25:32.739,"Uh, if you're here from Ming Gardens, ring twice."
00:25:32.739,00:25:34.367,"If not, I really don't want it."
00:25:43.167,00:25:45.085,You're not Chinese.
00:25:45.085,00:25:46.544,Matt?
00:25:46.544,00:25:49.382,Yeah.
00:25:49.382,00:25:51.091,You're tall.
00:25:51.091,00:25:53.260,You're different.
00:25:53.260,00:25:55.221,Yeah.
00:25:55.221,00:25:57.223,You don't know me?
00:25:57.223,00:25:59.766,"Oh, that's so weird, because yesterday you were there."
00:25:59.766,00:26:02.269,"The thing is, it wasn't yesterday, because I'm not 13."
00:26:02.269,00:26:04.562,Jenna.
00:26:04.562,00:26:06.148,Jenna Rink.
00:26:06.148,00:26:07.649,"Matt, it's me."
00:26:14.656,00:26:17.743,Hey.
00:26:17.743,00:26:19.953,Come on in.
00:26:25.251,00:26:26.710,You still take pictures?
00:26:26.710,00:26:29.838,"Uh, yeah. You know, it, uh, pays the bills."
00:26:29.838,00:26:31.173,Uh...
00:26:31.173,00:26:33.633,"Hey, Jenna, what are-- Why are you here?"
00:26:33.633,00:26:36.345,"Matty, I told you. Something really weird is happening."
00:26:36.345,00:26:39.597,"Yesterday was my 13th birthday, and then..."
00:26:39.597,00:26:44.437,"And then today I woke up, and I'm this, and you, I mean, you're that!"
00:26:44.437,00:26:46.105,You get it?
00:26:46.105,00:26:47.773,Are you high?
00:26:47.773,00:26:50.192,You been smoking pot?
00:26:50.192,00:26:52.361,Falling into the K-hole?
00:26:52.361,00:26:54.405,No! No.
00:26:54.405,00:26:56.282,Look...
00:26:56.282,00:26:59.659,"I was sitting in my closet, and I... I..."
00:26:59.659,00:27:02.204,I skipped everything.
00:27:02.204,00:27:03.956,I-I can't remember my life.
00:27:03.956,00:27:06.083,You need to help me remember my life.
00:27:06.083,00:27:07.501,Me.
00:27:07.501,00:27:09.211,I can't do that.
00:27:09.211,00:27:12.256,"I don't know anything about you, all right?"
00:27:12.256,00:27:14.341,I haven't seen you since high school.
00:27:14.341,00:27:16.927,What?
00:27:16.927,00:27:20.013,"We're not friends anymore, Jenna."
00:27:20.013,00:27:21.974,"Matty, you're my best friend."
00:27:21.974,00:27:24.184,No.
00:27:26.019,00:27:29.064,Okay. It's cool.
00:27:29.064,00:27:30.648,It's cool.
00:27:30.648,00:27:31.942,Is it warm in here?
00:27:31.942,00:27:33.319,It... It's... It's...
00:27:33.319,00:27:35.154,Maybe I should open a window.
00:27:35.154,00:27:38.907,"I think I need some fresh air and a glass of water and a fluffy pillow, please?"
00:27:38.907,00:27:41.243,You want a glass of water?
00:27:41.243,00:27:43.454,"You want a, uh, glass of water?"
00:27:43.454,00:27:45.038,I want a fluffy pillow! Please!
00:27:45.038,00:27:49.293,"A fluffy pillow, coming right up. Sorry."
00:27:49.293,00:27:51.669,You all right?
00:27:54.881,00:27:57.259,"Jenna, I think you should go back to your apartment."
00:27:57.259,00:27:59.970,I-I'll help you find it.
00:28:01.805,00:28:03.890,"Jenna, our lives went separate ways."
00:28:03.890,00:28:06.185,"We went to different colleges, different careers."
00:28:06.185,00:28:08.770,"Well, what about Christmas?"
00:28:08.770,00:28:11.315,I... I...
00:28:08.770,00:28:14.985,"I think I saw you through a frosted window once, six years ago."
00:28:14.985,00:28:17.946,Yeah.
00:28:17.946,00:28:19.532,"Jenna, I don't know."
00:28:19.532,00:28:21.908,Doesn't your crowd do St. Barts for Christmas?
00:28:21.908,00:28:23.701,I don't know.
00:28:23.701,00:28:25.829,Is this you?
00:28:25.829,00:28:27.747,Yeah.
00:28:27.747,00:28:30.167,This is where I live now.
00:28:36.256,00:28:38.050,"Okay, so..."
00:28:38.050,00:28:39.759,nice seeing you.
00:28:41.928,00:28:44.890,Good luck.
00:28:44.890,00:28:46.433,Okay?
00:28:46.433,00:28:47.726,Okay.
00:28:47.726,00:28:50.187,Bye.
00:28:54.191,00:28:57.444,Matt!
00:28:57.444,00:28:59.655,Who is St. Bart?
00:29:06.245,00:29:09.122,MATT: The most depressing years of my life.
00:29:09.122,00:29:10.999,Our high school yearbook.
00:29:10.999,00:29:12.918,"JENNA: Matt, was I a Six Chick?"
00:29:12.918,00:29:15.629,"Uh, yeah, you were pretty much their leader."
00:29:19.007,00:29:22.010,There's Tom-Tom.
00:29:22.010,00:29:24.346,"Last I heard, you guys were still pretty good friends."
00:29:24.346,00:29:26.223,I think you actually even work together.
00:29:26.223,00:29:28.934,"Lucy. Oh, my God, yes."
00:29:28.934,00:29:30.686,She's Lucy Wyman now.
00:29:30.686,00:29:34.440,She looks so different.
00:29:30.686,00:29:36.983,"Yeah, she's pretty big into the whole plastic surgery movement."
00:29:36.983,00:29:38.985,I was the prom queen.
00:29:38.985,00:29:41.113,MATT: Yep.
00:29:41.113,00:29:42.781,And I went with Chris Grandy.
00:29:42.781,00:29:44.575,Yep.
00:29:44.575,00:29:46.493,"Oh, this is incredible."
00:29:46.493,00:29:48.787,I got everything I ever wanted.
00:29:48.787,00:29:50.748,"Yeah, Jenna, you got it all."
00:29:50.748,00:29:52.916,Congratulations.
00:29:55.085,00:29:57.546,It's your phone.
00:30:03.302,00:30:05.220,Hello.
00:30:05.220,00:30:09.475,WOMAN: Hi. Gramercy calling to confirm your limousine pickup for 8:30 this evening.
00:30:09.475,00:30:11.518,My lim...
00:30:11.518,00:30:13.395,"Yes, my limousine for 8:30."
00:30:13.395,00:30:16.064,I will be prepared to take my ride at that time.
00:30:16.064,00:30:17.650,Can you tell me where I'm going?
00:30:17.650,00:30:21.194,"The Palace, 27 Wall Street."
00:30:21.194,00:30:22.821,Thank you.
00:30:22.821,00:30:26.408,I'm going to a party in a limo!
00:30:26.408,00:30:30.245,"Great. Looks like you're back to your old self, Jenn."
00:30:30.245,00:30:31.538,I should probably go.
00:30:31.538,00:30:33.039,You don't want to go to the party?
00:30:33.039,00:30:35.208,"Nah, I got to work."
00:30:35.208,00:30:37.503,Shoot. I forgot you have a job.
00:30:37.503,00:30:39.379,It's kind of cool we both have jobs.
00:30:39.379,00:30:40.756,Totally.
00:30:40.756,00:30:45.218,"Well, if you decide you want to come, it's gonna be really fun."
00:30:45.218,00:30:46.512,"Okay, great."
00:30:46.512,00:30:48.972,"Thanks, Jenna. Bye-bye."
00:30:48.972,00:30:51.266,Matt!
00:30:51.266,00:30:53.268,Yeah.
00:30:53.268,00:30:55.688,What if this isn't just a dream?
00:30:56.689,00:31:00.192,What if what I wished for actually happened?
00:31:00.192,00:31:02.402,"Well, then, you got everything you ever wanted."
00:31:02.402,00:31:04.822,You might as well enjoy it.
00:31:06.156,00:31:08.158,"Bye, Jenna."
00:31:12.996,00:31:15.708,Matty.
00:31:15.708,00:31:18.126,Arrivederci.
00:31:18.126,00:31:19.628,I'll see you.
00:31:19.628,00:31:20.879,Matt.
00:31:20.879,00:31:23.382,Yeah.
00:31:23.382,00:31:25.050,Au revoir.
00:32:57.726,00:33:00.061,"I'm Jenna, by the way."
00:33:00.061,00:33:01.313,"Yeah, I know."
00:33:01.313,00:33:02.940,I'm Becky.
00:33:02.940,00:33:04.650,"How old are you, anyway?"
00:33:04.650,00:33:06.067,13.
00:33:06.067,00:33:07.945,Me too.
00:33:07.945,00:33:09.613,Used to be.
00:33:13.074,00:33:15.285,Why are you talking to me?
00:33:15.285,00:33:17.496,Why not?
00:33:17.496,00:33:19.832,But you usually ignore me.
00:33:21.708,00:33:23.877,I like your shoes.
00:33:23.877,00:33:25.754,Thanks.
00:33:25.754,00:33:27.297,I like your dress.
00:33:27.297,00:33:31.468,It's because I've got these incredible boobs to fill it out.
00:33:32.886,00:33:34.513,I like your bag.
00:33:34.513,00:33:36.348,Thanks.
00:33:36.348,00:33:38.099,I've got like a zillion of 'em.
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.267,Really?
00:33:39.267,00:33:40.978,"Yeah, it'd be totally cool."
00:33:40.978,00:33:42.604,"Hey, Becky?"
00:33:42.604,00:33:43.772,Mm-hmm?
00:33:43.772,00:33:45.315,Can I ask you something?
00:33:45.315,00:33:46.692,"Yeah, sure."
00:33:46.692,00:33:49.068,Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?
00:33:49.068,00:33:50.529,'Cause I totally am.
00:33:50.529,00:33:52.489,I think that's kind of the point.
00:34:18.181,00:34:20.308,WOMAN: Try it. It's soft-shell crab.
00:34:34.072,00:34:35.490,Thanks.
00:34:48.879,00:34:51.590,"Hi, Tom-Tom."
00:34:48.879,00:34:53.675,"Oh, God, no one's called me that since I had my nose job."
00:34:53.675,00:34:54.968,You had a nose job?
00:34:54.968,00:34:56.636,"Yeah, and yours is better."
00:34:56.636,00:34:58.388,"Anything to drink, ladies?"
00:34:58.388,00:35:01.099,"Uh, an apple martini."
00:35:01.099,00:35:03.060,"Can I have a lemonade, please?"
00:35:03.060,00:35:04.269,"Oh, wait."
00:35:04.269,00:35:07.522,"Make it a piña colada, not virgin."
00:35:07.522,00:35:09.858,Do you want to see my I.D.?
00:35:09.858,00:35:11.777,There you two are.
00:35:11.777,00:35:14.696,"Lucy, very nice."
00:35:14.696,00:35:15.948,Sort of a...
00:35:15.948,00:35:18.157,dangerous mermaid look.
00:35:18.157,00:35:20.577,Oh!
00:35:20.577,00:35:22.746,You look scrum- diddly-umptious!
00:35:22.746,00:35:24.706,I know.
00:35:24.706,00:35:27.667,"Everybody Wang Chung tonight, right?"
00:35:30.545,00:35:32.839,Here you go.
00:35:35.884,00:35:37.844,Thank you.
00:35:39.178,00:35:40.430,Sorry.
00:35:40.430,00:35:42.057,"Keeping you up, are we? Come on."
00:35:42.057,00:35:44.768,It's only 11:00.
00:35:49.856,00:35:51.817,Oh.
00:35:51.817,00:35:55.320,It's 11:00 on a school night and I'm at a party.
00:35:55.320,00:35:57.781,It's 11:00 and people are leaving.
00:35:57.781,00:35:59.240,This is a disaster.
00:35:59.240,00:36:00.867,It is?
00:36:00.867,00:36:04.203,"Speaking of disasters, what is she doing here?"
00:36:04.203,00:36:08.000,"Sparkle's editor in chief, Trish Sackett, 12 o'clock and headed our way."
00:36:09.751,00:36:11.086,"Hi, girls."
00:36:11.086,00:36:13.296,Our J.Lo issue is selling like hotcakes.
00:36:13.296,00:36:15.632,How's yours doing?
00:36:15.632,00:36:19.177,Are things so bad you had to come to our party to eat some free food?
00:36:19.177,00:36:21.220,"Please, put some crab in your purse for later."
00:36:21.220,00:36:30.939,"You might want to keep some of that biting wit for your magazine, or maybe you could just change the name to something more appropriate, like Poison or Pitiful."
00:36:30.939,00:36:32.732,Whatever is more pathetic.
00:36:32.732,00:36:34.275,You know what?
00:36:34.275,00:36:37.403,You are rude and mean and sloppy and frizzy.
00:36:37.403,00:36:39.739,I don't like you at all.
00:36:39.739,00:36:42.200,"Well, fortunately, I don't care about being liked."
00:36:42.200,00:36:43.910,I care about winning.
00:36:43.910,00:36:45.244,This is delicious.
00:36:47.664,00:36:49.457,Ladies.
00:36:55.964,00:36:58.175,Do I smell?
00:36:58.175,00:36:59.926,Do I have bad breath?
00:36:59.926,00:37:03.638,Am I malodorous in any way?
00:37:03.638,00:37:05.098,No.
00:37:05.098,00:37:08.810,Because people seem to be running for the exit like someone set off a giant stink bomb.
00:37:08.810,00:37:10.353,I don't smell anything.
00:37:10.353,00:37:12.856,I think that he means the party is a stinker.
00:37:12.856,00:37:18.361,"A dud, a flop, a zero on a scale of one to 10."
00:37:18.361,00:37:22.115,"Well, maybe if somebody played something other than this."
00:37:22.115,00:37:23.658,"Honey, play whatever you want to."
00:37:23.658,00:37:31.875,"All I know is if all those people don't start dancing really, really soon, here's to early retirement."
00:37:31.875,00:37:33.210,Yippee.
00:38:47.909,00:38:50.245,"Matty! Matty, come here!"
00:38:50.245,00:38:51.704,Hey.
00:38:51.704,00:38:53.331,Matty!
00:38:53.331,00:38:56.293,Come here! Thriller.
00:38:56.293,00:38:57.585,Matty.
00:38:57.585,00:38:58.837,Me?
00:38:58.837,00:39:00.839,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:39:00.839,00:39:02.757,Thriller.
00:39:02.757,00:39:04.009,Uh-uh. No way.
00:39:04.009,00:39:05.885,"Come on, man, go!"
00:39:05.885,00:39:08.221,"Jenna, no way."
00:39:08.221,00:39:10.182,Come on!
00:39:10.182,00:39:11.349,I don't remember these moves.
00:39:11.349,00:39:12.725,"Oh, for the love of Pete."
00:39:12.725,00:39:14.102,I haven't done this in 15 years.
00:39:14.102,00:39:16.646,"What are you, crazy?"
00:39:31.369,00:39:33.788,"Come on, Matty."
00:39:37.042,00:39:38.668,"Okay, here we go."
00:40:02.942,00:40:04.402,"All right, let's go, let's go!"
00:40:50.698,00:40:53.701,"Jenna, I'm sorry."
00:40:53.701,00:40:54.869,What do you...?
00:40:54.869,00:40:56.996,I'm sorry.
00:40:56.996,00:40:58.331,Matt!
00:41:08.549,00:41:10.343,I adore you!
00:41:33.283,00:41:35.243,"Miss, wait!"
00:41:35.243,00:41:36.953,Your credit card!
00:41:38.997,00:41:40.165,Oh!
00:42:18.953,00:42:21.622,Thank you.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.708,I've decided it's gonna be totally awesome.
00:42:23.708,00:42:25.043,Of course it is.
00:42:25.043,00:42:28.380,"You're thin, you're hot, you can get any guy you want, beyotch!"
00:42:28.380,00:42:32.842,"Not to mention, beyotch, the hottest magazine editor in the world."
00:42:32.842,00:42:34.260,Second hottest.
00:42:34.260,00:42:35.553,Tied for first?
00:42:35.553,00:42:37.555,Deal.
00:42:37.555,00:42:44.062,"And speaking of hot, Mr. Hotty behind you is totally scamming on you right now."
00:42:53.654,00:42:55.532,He is not.
00:42:55.532,00:42:57.492,He's totally cute.
00:42:57.492,00:42:59.077,Should I go talk to him?
00:42:59.077,00:43:00.661,You're not married.
00:43:03.622,00:43:05.083,Good.
00:43:15.927,00:43:18.054,Hi.
00:43:19.305,00:43:21.057,Could I borrow your ketchup?
00:43:21.057,00:43:23.851,Sure.
00:43:26.229,00:43:28.856,I actually came over here...
00:43:28.856,00:43:31.443,because I think you're really cute.
00:43:32.777,00:43:34.279,So do you want to go out sometime?
00:43:34.279,00:43:35.905,"Um, we're gonna take off now."
00:43:35.905,00:43:37.156,Can you drive?
00:43:37.156,00:43:38.491,Time to go.
00:43:38.491,00:43:40.159,"What, do you want to go to jail?"
00:43:40.159,00:43:41.453,I meant that guy.
00:43:41.453,00:43:43.204,"The man? Oh, gross."
00:43:43.204,00:43:47.333,No more daiquiris for you tonight.
00:43:47.333,00:43:50.169,I can never find a taxi in this neighborhood.
00:43:50.169,00:43:51.879,"Oh, my God."
00:43:51.879,00:43:53.590,"Hey, beautiful."
00:43:53.590,00:43:55.425,He thinks I'm beautiful?
00:43:55.425,00:43:57.676,"Well, he should."
00:43:57.676,00:43:59.971,My boyfriend?
00:44:01.722,00:44:06.060,"Hey, why is that lady asking for my boyfriend's autograph?"
00:44:06.060,00:44:11.107,"He may not be the best New York Ranger, but he's the New York Ranger with the best ass."
00:44:12.317,00:44:13.692,MATT: Jenna?
00:44:13.692,00:44:16.779,"Oh, my God. Matt! Hi!"
00:44:16.779,00:44:19.574,How are you?
00:44:19.574,00:44:22.868,"I'm, uh, sorry about the other night."
00:44:22.868,00:44:25.371,Beaver? Is that you?
00:44:25.371,00:44:27.123,"Hey, Tom-Tom. How are you?"
00:44:27.123,00:44:28.874,You lost all your baby fat.
00:44:28.874,00:44:31.294,How does the Beave stay warm in the winter?
00:44:31.294,00:44:32.795,"Yeah, it's good to see you again too."
00:44:32.795,00:44:34.631,"You know, I almost didn't recognize you."
00:44:34.631,00:44:37.467,Did you get a nose job?
00:44:37.467,00:44:38.801,What are you doing here?
00:44:38.801,00:44:40.512,"I'm, uh..."
00:44:40.512,00:44:42.721,"I'm doing some, uh, shopping with my, uh..."
00:44:42.721,00:44:45.224,"Jenna, this is Wendy, my fiancée."
00:44:45.224,00:44:46.725,Oh.
00:44:46.725,00:44:48.144,I'm Jenna.
00:44:48.144,00:44:50.480,Matt told me all about his blast from the past.
00:44:50.480,00:44:52.398,It was really sweet of you to stop by.
00:44:52.398,00:44:54.567,Matty's the sweet one.
00:44:54.567,00:44:57.153,I don't know what I would've done without him.
00:44:57.153,00:44:59.656,I'm sure you'll be just fine.
00:44:59.656,00:45:02.492,I see you guys have spent so much time talking about me.
00:45:02.492,00:45:03.951,"Wendy's a, uh, an anchorwoman."
00:45:03.951,00:45:05.370,Anchorperson.
00:45:05.370,00:45:07.746,I do the weather for WWEN in Chicago.
00:45:07.746,00:45:11.834,"Actually, Matt and I were just talking about him finally joining me in the Windy City."
00:45:11.834,00:45:14.753,You're moving to Chicago?
00:45:14.753,00:45:16.422,Yes.
00:45:14.753,00:45:18.675,We were just discuss-- We haven't really-- Is that Alex Carlson?
00:45:18.675,00:45:20.092,Sweet Bottom. Jenna.
00:45:20.092,00:45:22.261,Sorry.
00:45:22.261,00:45:23.762,"Well, hi!"
00:45:23.762,00:45:25.682,Hey.
00:45:25.682,00:45:27.433,Hey.
00:45:27.433,00:45:30.019,"This is my good friend, Matt, and this is his friend, Wendy."
00:45:30.019,00:45:31.812,Fiancée.
00:45:31.812,00:45:33.690,Nice to meet you.
00:45:33.690,00:45:36.942,And this is...
00:45:36.942,00:45:38.486,You're Alex Carlson.
00:45:38.486,00:45:39.654,Nice-- Nice to meet you.
00:45:39.654,00:45:41.197,You're a great hockey player.
00:45:41.197,00:45:43.115,I'm a big fan of yours.
00:45:43.115,00:45:45.702,You want me to sign your shirt or your forehead or something?
00:45:45.702,00:45:48.871,"Now, I don't do butts."
00:45:48.871,00:45:54.085,Sorry. I crack a lot of jokes after we win on account of because I'm in such a good mood.
00:45:56.629,00:45:59.674,"Okay, well, uh, we should probably get going."
00:45:59.674,00:46:01.676,Nice to meet you.
00:46:01.676,00:46:02.927,All right.
00:46:02.927,00:46:05.304,Nice to see you folks. Bye.
00:46:08.641,00:46:12.061,"Lucy, you mind if I steal her from you for the rest of the night?"
00:46:12.061,00:46:14.313,Nope.
00:46:12.061,00:46:17.275,"I actually had my eye on something a little better inside, so I'll see you guys later."
00:46:17.275,00:46:19.068,Have a good night.
00:46:19.068,00:46:21.987,Excuse me one second.
00:46:23.573,00:46:25.283,Should I go to his place?
00:46:25.283,00:46:26.576,Alone?
00:46:26.576,00:46:28.035,Yeah. Why not?
00:46:28.035,00:46:30.622,Go play.
00:46:30.622,00:46:31.997,Play?
00:46:31.997,00:46:33.916,You mean like games and stuff?
00:46:33.916,00:46:36.919,Yeah. Games.
00:46:36.919,00:46:39.838,All kinds of games.
00:46:39.838,00:46:41.424,Okay.
00:46:52.226,00:46:55.020,I couldn't wait to see you tonight.
00:46:56.188,00:46:58.190,You want to play a game?
00:46:58.190,00:46:59.567,Do you have Battleship?
00:46:59.567,00:47:01.444,"Yeah, I have Battleship."
00:47:01.444,00:47:04.656,I'll show you my destroyer.
00:47:04.656,00:47:06.031,I call the red board.
00:47:06.031,00:47:08.451,"Well, I call the blue board."
00:47:14.123,00:47:15.667,Huh?
00:47:17.042,00:47:18.877,What?
00:47:22.839,00:47:24.216,"Uh, okay."
00:47:24.216,00:47:27.844,I know. I forgot.
00:47:27.844,00:47:31.182,I owe you one raunchy striptease.
00:47:41.025,00:47:43.695,"Oh, God."
00:47:43.695,00:47:45.363,"Oh, gross."
00:47:52.411,00:47:57.208,"Who's got the moves on the ice and off the ice, ice, baby?"
00:47:57.208,00:47:58.668,"Ooh, no."
00:47:58.668,00:48:01.295,"Wait, wait! I don't want to see that thing again!"
00:48:01.295,00:48:02.921,Put it away!
00:48:02.921,00:48:04.590,Put it away!
00:48:04.590,00:48:06.175,God.
00:48:10.722,00:48:12.515,Oh.
00:48:12.515,00:48:14.225,We can play Monopoly.
00:48:14.225,00:48:16.853,We can play Parcheesi.
00:48:16.853,00:48:18.604,JENNA: He didn't have Battleship.
00:48:18.604,00:48:20.231,He didn't have any games at all.
00:48:20.231,00:48:21.940,Boys are so stupid.
00:48:21.940,00:48:24.819,"Oh, Becky, it's even worse than you think."
00:48:24.819,00:48:27.904,"I mean, how come the ones that you like never like you?"
00:48:27.904,00:48:29.906,"Well, you have to fight for what you want."
00:48:29.906,00:48:34.328,Rule number one-- Love is a battlefield.
00:48:34.328,00:48:36.831,Wow. That's deep.
00:48:36.831,00:48:38.624,Really deep.
00:48:38.624,00:48:40.376,Good luck with fractions.
00:48:40.376,00:48:43.212,Have fun at work.
00:48:44.589,00:48:46.632,"To the office, Tom."
00:48:48.300,00:48:51.262,WOMAN: 57 ways to have an orgasm.
00:48:51.262,00:48:52.805,Ooh!
00:48:52.805,00:48:54.849,I didn't know there were 57.
00:48:54.849,00:48:57.268,Touch her there underwear.
00:48:57.268,00:48:59.437,Nice.
00:48:59.437,00:49:01.564,"He loves you, but..."
00:49:01.564,00:49:04.567,He loves your butt.
00:49:04.567,00:49:06.903,He lies. He cheats.
00:49:06.903,00:49:09.906,What are you doing wrong?
00:49:13.826,00:49:19.540,"Uh, there's no easy way of saying this, so I'll..."
00:49:20.792,00:49:22.627,The circs are in.
00:49:22.627,00:49:24.629,Our numbers are dismal.
00:49:24.629,00:49:27.548,"We're below 600,000 total circulation."
00:49:27.548,00:49:30.175,Sparkle is closing in on a million.
00:49:30.175,00:49:36.307,I've just come off the phone with corporate and they have dropped the R word.
00:49:36.307,00:49:39.310,WOMAN: Redesign?
00:49:39.310,00:49:41.270,Redesign Poise?
00:49:41.270,00:49:45.065,"Sparkle copies everything we come up with, everything we do, and we have to redesign?"
00:49:45.065,00:49:46.734,That's total bullshit.
00:49:46.734,00:49:52.072,"Well, either we redesign and bring up our numbers, or they pull the plug."
00:49:52.072,00:49:54.700,"Richard, redesign is a death sentence."
00:49:54.700,00:49:55.910,"No, it's not."
00:49:55.910,00:49:58.579,It's a chance to have some fun.
00:49:58.579,00:50:03.918,"Let Sparkle have all our second-hand, stale, grody ideas."
00:50:03.918,00:50:06.838,"We'll open up the F.O.B., overhaul the B.O.B."
00:50:06.838,00:50:10.132,It's time for us to pull together and prove we have some Poise left.
00:50:10.132,00:50:18.014,"Well, I shall be leaving it to my dynamic duo to come up with something utterly fabulous."
00:50:19.391,00:50:23.646,"RICHARD: We have two weeks, four hours, and 40 minutes."
00:50:24.730,00:50:26.357,I have your urgent messages.
00:50:26.357,00:50:29.234,Let's hear 'em.
00:50:30.778,00:50:37.535,"Uh, Emily Pratt called and wanted me to tell you, I can't believe you scooped my story on Vivienne Tam, you backbiting little bitch."
00:50:37.535,00:50:40.830,"That was a new level of sleaze, even for you."
00:50:38.995,00:50:42.456,I hope you die in one of her casual pantsuits.
00:50:42.456,00:50:44.750,"Oh, my God, that was so mean."
00:50:44.750,00:50:47.712,"Uh, Ms. Lewis called."
00:50:44.750,00:50:55.469,"She said, I hope you choke on your own bile, you pretentious, conniving snake. Uh-- Maybe I should read them myself."
00:50:55.469,00:50:56.762,Good.
00:50:56.762,00:50:59.348,Oh. Great.
00:51:02.518,00:51:04.144,Miss Rink's line.
00:51:04.144,00:51:06.397,MAN: Put that little bitch on the phone now.
00:51:06.397,00:51:08.691,"Uh, please, sir, don't take that tone with me."
00:51:08.691,00:51:11.652,I'm just her assistant.
00:51:11.652,00:51:13.988,"Sweet Bottom, you seem uptight."
00:51:13.988,00:51:16.699,Let me come over and give you my...
00:51:24.665,00:51:25.958,Yes?
00:51:25.958,00:51:28.002,"Alex is on line one, Miss Rink."
00:51:28.002,00:51:29.628,"Oh, gag me."
00:51:29.628,00:51:31.714,Can you please tell him I'm busy?
00:51:31.714,00:51:36.092,"Uh, okay, but he wants to know what time would be good for dinner."
00:51:36.092,00:51:38.178,How about in 10 zillion years?
00:51:38.178,00:51:39.555,Ask him how that works.
00:51:39.555,00:51:41.223,Okay. I'll...
00:51:41.223,00:51:43.099,Okay.
00:51:46.186,00:51:47.688,Yeah?
00:51:47.688,00:51:51.191,"I'm sorry to bother you again, Miss Rink, but Pete Hansen is here to see you."
00:51:51.191,00:51:52.651,Who?
00:51:52.651,00:51:55.111,Tracy from the art department's husband.
00:51:55.111,00:51:58.407,"Oh, okay. Sure."
00:52:08.542,00:52:10.878,I was just dropping off Tracy's lunch.
00:52:10.878,00:52:12.296,Thought I'd say hello.
00:52:15.633,00:52:17.133,You brought Tracy her lunch?
00:52:17.133,00:52:25.183,That's so sw-- What are you doing?
00:52:25.183,00:52:26.518,"What's wrong, pooky?"
00:52:26.518,00:52:29.229,Pooky? Pukey!
00:52:29.229,00:52:32.190,"You're married, and to a girl I work with!"
00:52:32.190,00:52:38.030,"Well, that didn't stop us from rattling some desk drawers loose last week, so come on."
00:52:38.030,00:52:39.323,Lie down and take a memo.
00:52:48.415,00:52:53.545,"LUCY: Now, listen, I want you to hire the best photographer, and I don't want Jenna to find out."
00:52:53.545,00:52:55.422,No. Roger that.
00:52:55.422,00:52:57.341,"Got it. What is up with her lately, anyway?"
00:52:57.341,00:52:59.426,"I mean, she seems so... lost."
00:52:59.426,00:53:01.012,LUCY: I have no idea.
00:53:01.012,00:53:05.599,"I am getting so sick of having her around, and this crazy new act that she has going on."
00:53:05.599,00:53:07.685,"You know how she stole Charlotte's idea, right?"
00:53:07.685,00:53:10.146,And then fired her?
00:53:07.685,00:53:13.065,I say we go ahead with our own presentation and let her fall on her ass.
00:53:13.065,00:53:16.027,"WOMAN: Oh, God, yeah."
00:53:46.765,00:53:50.477,"Okay, you're not Cajun."
00:53:50.477,00:53:52.813,Want to go for a walk?
00:53:52.813,00:53:54.690,Sure.
00:54:01.739,00:54:04.158,I still can't believe you're getting married.
00:54:04.158,00:54:05.576,"Yeah, in two weeks."
00:54:05.576,00:54:07.745,Yeah.
00:54:09.830,00:54:12.208,Is she your soulmate?
00:54:13.333,00:54:14.752,My soulmate?
00:54:14.752,00:54:16.252,I don't know if I believe in those.
00:54:16.252,00:54:19.255,I think that's kind of naive.
00:54:19.255,00:54:24.762,"But you get goosebumps when you're around her, and... butterflies?"
00:54:24.762,00:54:28.933,"Uh, no, I haven't gotten crazy like that about a girl since high school."
00:54:28.933,00:54:31.018,Thank goodness.
00:54:31.018,00:54:33.104,Matty...
00:54:35.647,00:54:37.024,what...
00:54:37.024,00:54:38.817,What happened to us?
00:54:38.817,00:54:41.445,"I mean, how come we never stayed friends?"
00:54:43.405,00:54:45.574,I don't know. I forget.
00:54:45.574,00:54:47.993,"No, what happened?"
00:54:47.993,00:54:49.661,I don't know.
00:54:49.661,00:54:54.833,"I can pretty much peg it to your 13th birthday party, uh, when you were in the closet playing that game."
00:54:54.833,00:54:56.334,"What is it, Spin the Rapist?"
00:54:56.334,00:55:01.173,"The Seven Minutes in Heaven and everybody ditched, and that is the last thing I remember."
00:55:01.173,00:55:02.967,"Look, we don't have to get into this."
00:55:02.967,00:55:04.384,It's such a long time ago.
00:55:04.384,00:55:05.928,It really doesn't matter anymore.
00:55:05.928,00:55:07.263,It matters to me.
00:55:07.263,00:55:09.723,Just...
00:55:12.434,00:55:33.705,"Well, you came out of the closet and, um, I started to sing my birthday song to you, and then you picked up and threw at me, with impressive force, I might add, the dream house that I spent three weeks building for you, and then, um, you just stopped being my friend, and you never spoke to me again after that, ever."
00:55:37.333,00:55:40.462,I'm so sorry.
00:55:40.462,00:55:42.380,"Forget it, Jenna."
00:55:42.380,00:55:43.715,It doesn't matter.
00:55:43.715,00:55:45.759,"Matt, stop being so nice to me."
00:55:45.759,00:55:47.469,I don't deserve it.
00:55:48.887,00:55:51.098,Do you know what kind of person I am now?
00:55:51.098,00:55:54.226,"I mean, do you know who I am right now? I..."
00:55:56.061,00:55:57.771,I don't have any real friends.
00:55:57.771,00:55:59.148,I...
00:55:59.148,00:56:02.151,I did something bad with a married guy.
00:56:02.151,00:56:03.861,I don't talk to my mom and dad.
00:56:03.861,00:56:06.113,I...
00:56:06.113,00:56:10.492,"I'm not a nice person, and the thing is..."
00:56:10.492,00:56:13.037,I'm not 13 anymore.
00:56:16.332,00:56:18.709,Jenna.
00:58:09.027,00:58:12.030,It's good to be home.
00:58:12.030,00:58:13.991,Oh!
00:58:22.791,00:58:24.168,Daddy.
00:58:24.168,00:58:25.585,MOM: Jenna!
00:58:25.585,00:58:27.504,What in the world...?
00:58:27.504,00:58:29.798,Oh.
00:58:29.798,00:58:31.342,I missed you guys so much.
00:58:31.342,00:58:33.593,Are you all right?
00:59:36.532,00:59:37.908,Mom.
00:59:37.908,00:59:39.535,Mm-hmm.
00:59:39.535,00:59:42.704,Do you ever wish you could go back?
00:59:42.704,00:59:44.540,Like to another time?
00:59:44.540,00:59:49.336,I wouldn't mind giving back some of these wrinkles.
00:59:49.336,00:59:51.380,Okay. Um...
00:59:51.380,00:59:57.635,if you were given one do-over-- anything in your life-- what would it be?
01:00:03.308,01:00:04.809,Nothing.
01:00:04.809,01:00:06.770,Really?
01:00:06.770,01:00:09.314,Really.
01:00:09.314,01:00:11.024,But did you ever make a big mistake?
01:00:11.024,01:00:13.777,A huge one that could change your life?
01:00:13.777,01:00:15.195,What about that?
01:00:15.195,01:00:20.700,"Well, Jenna, I know I made a lot of mistakes, but I don't regret making any of them."
01:00:20.700,01:00:22.786,How come?
01:00:22.786,01:00:28.666,"Because if I hadn't have made them, I wouldn't have learned how to make things right."
01:00:36.883,01:00:40.095,I'm sorry I missed last Christmas.
01:01:20.552,01:01:23.180,"Carrie, I'm heading out, okay?"
01:01:26.057,01:01:27.934,I'm so exhausted.
01:01:27.934,01:01:30.187,"Oh, Jenna's working late."
01:01:40.447,01:01:41.781,Hey!
01:01:41.781,01:01:43.033,Hey.
01:01:43.033,01:01:44.993,I was gonna stop by your office.
01:01:44.993,01:01:46.911,I actually tried to call you a bunch of times.
01:01:46.911,01:01:48.455,I didn't get any messages.
01:01:48.455,01:01:52.876,"I was in a hurry, but I did try to reach you."
01:01:52.876,01:01:56.672,I actually wanted to talk to you about this whole redesign thing.
01:01:56.672,01:01:58.840,Mm.
01:01:56.672,01:02:01.510,"I hope you don't mind, but I've sort of been working on something on my own."
01:02:01.510,01:02:03.845,It's really last-minute.
01:02:03.845,01:02:05.305,I hope you don't mind.
01:02:05.305,01:02:07.891,"No, of course not..."
01:02:07.891,01:02:10.768,because I'm doing the same thing.
01:02:22.656,01:02:24.533,"Hey, Jenna."
01:02:24.533,01:02:26.868,Hey.
01:02:26.868,01:02:28.786,Someone's got a big photo shoot going on.
01:02:28.786,01:02:30.455,Yeah.
01:02:30.455,01:02:32.082,What's happening?
01:02:32.082,01:02:34.585,"Oh, yeah."
01:02:34.585,01:02:35.919,What are you doing?
01:02:35.919,01:02:37.421,I'm hiring you.
01:02:37.421,01:02:40.507,"Actually, Poise is hiring you for the week."
01:02:40.507,01:02:42.759,Here.
01:02:47.639,01:02:50.642,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wh-- Oh, this is just the first half."
01:02:50.642,01:02:52.477,You'll get the rest when we're finished.
01:02:52.477,01:02:55.813,"You know, I could really use this, but you don't need to do me any favors."
01:02:55.813,01:02:57.482,I'm asking you to do me a favor.
01:02:57.482,01:02:59.109,I love your work.
01:02:59.109,01:03:01.945,I hope you'll do this with me.
01:03:01.945,01:03:04.239,Uh...
01:03:04.239,01:03:06.408,"You know, Jenna, I-I've seen your magazine."
01:03:06.408,01:03:08.493,My stuff is not your style at all.
01:03:11.162,01:03:13.915,Exactly.
01:03:13.915,01:03:17.168,Who gets Francis?
01:03:17.168,01:03:18.920,There we go.
01:03:18.920,01:03:20.464,"Okay, let's do it!"
01:03:23.425,01:03:25.051,"JENNA: Okay, everybody!"
01:03:25.051,01:03:27.429,"Okay, everybody!"
01:03:27.429,01:03:28.846,All right.
01:03:28.846,01:03:30.599,Come on.
01:03:30.599,01:03:31.849,Keep up the flag.
01:03:31.849,01:03:33.226,All right!
01:03:33.226,01:03:36.896,"Jenna, this is your class 2004."
01:03:48.533,01:03:50.661,Very good. Very good.
01:05:19.040,01:05:20.375,"I mean, they're beautiful."
01:05:20.375,01:05:22.168,"Yeah, they came out okay, huh?"
01:05:22.168,01:05:23.920,I think so.
01:05:23.920,01:05:26.964,Do you?
01:05:34.514,01:05:36.433,"Yeah, it's getting late."
01:05:36.433,01:05:38.059,I should get home.
01:05:38.059,01:05:41.897,"It's... It's getting pretty late here, you know-- You know what I wish I had?"
01:05:41.897,01:05:43.314,Right now?
01:05:43.314,01:05:45.149,No. What?
01:05:45.149,01:05:46.943,Razzles.
01:05:46.943,01:05:49.529,Razzles?
01:05:49.529,01:05:52.407,Wow. I haven't had Razzles in...
01:05:53.950,01:05:55.410,15 years!
01:05:55.410,01:05:57.579,"Remember, they're both a candy and a gum."
01:05:57.579,01:05:58.996,That's incredible.
01:05:58.996,01:06:01.291,I can't believe they had them!
01:06:01.291,01:06:03.042,Okay. Don't waste a minute.
01:06:03.042,01:06:05.462,It's been a long time. Careful.
01:06:05.462,01:06:07.380,Mm. Uh-huh. Yeah.
01:06:07.380,01:06:09.633,Uh-huh.
01:06:10.967,01:06:12.469,What are you laughing at?
01:06:12.469,01:06:14.429,I don't know.
01:06:14.429,01:06:15.722,Life. Timing.
01:06:15.722,01:06:18.934,"Being here with you, eating Razzles."
01:06:23.271,01:06:26.483,"You know, I've had a really great time working with you this week..."
01:06:26.483,01:06:28.151,Me too.
01:06:28.151,01:06:30.528,Yeah.
01:06:31.696,01:06:33.030,"Hey, Matty."
01:06:33.030,01:06:34.407,Mm-hmm?
01:06:34.407,01:06:36.576,Tell me something.
01:06:36.576,01:06:39.203,What color is my tongue?
01:06:39.203,01:06:40.622,What? What?
01:06:40.622,01:06:42.332,What color is my tongue?
01:06:42.332,01:06:43.583,It's red.
01:06:43.583,01:06:46.127,Red red or tongue red?
01:06:46.127,01:06:48.421,Razzle Red.
01:06:48.421,01:06:50.047,Show me yours.
01:06:50.047,01:06:52.133,Show me your tongue.
01:06:52.133,01:06:53.677,I'm not showing you my tongue.
01:06:53.677,01:06:55.595,Show me your tongue. Come on.
01:06:55.595,01:06:57.221,I didn't ask to see yours.
01:06:57.221,01:06:59.307,"Matty, I need to see your tongue."
01:07:00.767,01:07:03.269,Razzle Red.
01:07:06.397,01:07:09.693,You want to know a secret?
01:07:09.693,01:07:11.820,Yeah.
01:07:11.820,01:07:14.447,You're the sweetest guy I've ever known.
01:07:18.910,01:07:21.579,I bet I can still beat you off the jump.
01:07:24.916,01:07:29.004,"Whoever goes the furthest, the other owes a drink."
01:07:29.004,01:07:30.714,"Ooh, upping the stakes."
01:07:30.714,01:07:38.471,And dinner Friday night at 8:00 at the 24th Street Diner to celebrate our redesign being chosen.
01:07:38.471,01:07:39.973,Deal.
01:07:39.973,01:07:41.766,One.
01:07:41.766,01:07:43.142,One.
01:07:43.142,01:07:45.603,two...
01:07:45.603,01:07:46.938,three!
01:07:46.938,01:07:49.190,Oh!
01:07:49.190,01:07:50.901,Oh!
01:07:50.901,01:07:52.610,Are you okay?
01:07:52.610,01:07:54.738,I should've tucked and rolled.
01:07:54.738,01:07:56.447,"Oh, I'm getting old."
01:07:56.447,01:07:58.658,"No, you're not, because that means I am."
01:07:58.658,01:08:01.036,Well...
01:08:06.207,01:08:08.043,Hey.
01:08:08.043,01:08:10.879,You got arm hair.
01:08:10.879,01:08:14.758,It's never quite got that reaction before.
01:08:47.582,01:08:50.085,JENNA: It was like it wasn't even me.
01:08:50.085,01:08:52.003,Like I had just...
01:08:52.003,01:08:55.715,"watched us down below, kissing."
01:08:55.715,01:09:00.303,Then I just floated home on a cloud.
01:09:01.471,01:09:04.808,That is so romantic.
01:09:07.310,01:09:08.728,Look.
01:09:08.728,01:09:10.229,You've got goosebumps.
01:09:10.229,01:09:12.398,I totally know.
01:09:12.398,01:09:15.693,Do you love him?
01:09:15.693,01:09:17.570,Duh!
01:09:17.570,01:09:20.448,When are you gonna see him again?
01:09:20.448,01:09:22.742,"I don't know, actually."
01:09:22.742,01:09:23.952,What?
01:09:23.952,01:09:26.245,Why?
01:09:26.245,01:09:28.498,It's a grown-up thing.
01:09:28.498,01:09:32.752,"Well, at least you have someone to dream about."
01:09:32.752,01:09:35.880,Guys don't exactly want to jump your bones when you're a metal mouth.
01:09:35.880,01:09:37.381,What is that attitude?
01:09:37.381,01:09:39.216,We are young.
01:09:39.216,01:09:42.971,Heartache to heartache we stand.
01:09:42.971,01:09:45.473,Love...
01:09:45.473,01:09:48.935,is a battlefield.
01:09:48.935,01:09:50.561,ALL: Wow.
01:10:20.257,01:10:24.137,"But I like it with this, with freckle girl and the dog."
01:10:24.137,01:10:25.722,"These photos are unbelievable, Jen."
01:10:25.722,01:10:27.223,"Okay, here's the dog."
01:10:27.223,01:10:28.432,Aw. Francis is the dog's name.
01:10:28.432,01:10:30.143,"Okay, look."
01:10:30.143,01:10:35.023,"Well, I think that I'm gonna start reading Poise for the first time in my life."
01:10:51.247,01:10:54.167,"MATT: Nah, I got a place I rent in Brooklyn."
01:10:54.167,01:10:56.460,That'll work?
01:10:56.460,01:10:58.755,Bye-bye.
01:11:02.800,01:11:04.177,Hey.
01:11:04.177,01:11:08.139,I wasn't expecting to see you until-- Wendy...
01:11:08.139,01:11:09.849,I thought you were flying in tomorrow.
01:11:09.849,01:11:11.601,"What, are you expecting someone else?"
01:11:11.601,01:11:14.437,Huh? No. Hi.
01:11:14.437,01:11:16.564,I want to take you to lunch. Are you hungry?
01:11:16.564,01:11:18.816,"Uh, yeah, yeah."
01:11:18.816,01:11:21.111,Mm-hmm.
01:11:18.816,01:11:24.697,"Okay, where do you-- What do you, uh-- How was your-- How was your flight?"
01:11:24.697,01:11:31.204,"WENDY: You can take pictures of vitamin bottles anywhere, and I was just thinking that we should really just try to resolve this now."
01:11:31.204,01:11:36.375,"Instead of being a commuter couple during our first year of marriage, you know?"
01:11:37.668,01:11:39.754,What?
01:11:39.754,01:11:41.380,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:11:41.380,01:11:42.715,"Could you, uh..."
01:11:42.715,01:11:45.093,I missed that.
01:11:45.093,01:11:46.385,Arlene.
01:11:46.385,01:11:47.720,Do you have any more-- Jenna.
01:11:47.720,01:11:49.680,What?
01:11:47.720,01:11:51.224,"My balls, excuse my French, are in an iron vice."
01:11:51.224,01:11:57.021,"Corporate is twisting and squeezing like a bunch of dominatrixes on steroids, and now Lucy is presenting her own redesign."
01:11:57.021,01:11:58.773,"Will you tell me what's going on, please?"
01:11:58.773,01:12:01.234,What is going on is that you are gonna have more choices.
01:12:01.234,01:12:06.322,"With all due respect to Lucy, I am far more anxious to know what you've been working on."
01:12:06.322,01:12:07.782,I'm not trying to compliment you.
01:12:07.782,01:12:09.284,I'm trying to pressure you.
01:12:09.284,01:12:11.577,How long until your balls get totally squished?
01:12:11.577,01:12:12.954,Hopefully never.
01:12:12.954,01:12:14.747,I'm really rather attached to my balls.
01:12:14.747,01:12:17.374,Can they hang in there till 5?
01:12:17.374,01:12:19.877,"Jenna, you are not yourself at the moment."
01:12:19.877,01:12:21.629,"You know that, don't you?"
01:12:21.629,01:12:23.339,Since when do you keep me out of the loop?
01:12:23.339,01:12:25.049,I'm really freaking out here.
01:12:25.049,01:12:26.509,The rest of the prints are ready.
01:12:26.509,01:12:28.178,"Oh, goody."
01:12:28.178,01:12:30.221,Why does nobody listen to a word I say anymore?
01:12:30.221,01:12:32.640,"Arlene, aren't you coming?"
01:12:32.640,01:12:35.185,"Oh, you're invited, are you?"
01:12:35.185,01:12:37.228,"Wait, I forgot my-- Oh. Oh, sorry."
01:12:37.228,01:12:39.314,"Oh, no excuse me."
01:12:39.314,01:12:40.606,"You know, what am I?"
01:12:40.606,01:12:43.567,"I'm just the, uh, editor in chief."
01:12:43.567,01:12:45.945,Whatever.
01:12:45.945,01:12:50.825,"We've got to go, um, to 23rd, please, between 5th and 6th."
01:12:50.825,01:12:52.202,JENNA: It's 29 West 23rd.
01:12:52.202,01:12:53.953,"You got it, lady."
01:12:53.953,01:12:59.500,LUCY: The new and improved Poise will explore the last frontier.
01:12:59.500,01:13:02.253,It will go heroin chic one better.
01:13:02.253,01:13:04.255,It will O.D.
01:13:04.255,01:13:07.091,It will kill.
01:13:07.091,01:13:08.551,Cause of death?
01:13:08.551,01:13:10.469,Chicness.
01:13:10.469,01:13:16.017,The new Poise will go farther than any fashion magazine ever before.
01:13:16.017,01:13:19.103,It will be deadly serious.
01:13:19.103,01:13:22.148,Fashion Suicide.
01:13:25.068,01:13:27.904,"So, what do you think?"
01:13:33.076,01:13:34.911,WOMAN: She's crazy.
01:13:37.997,01:13:39.582,"Thank you, sir."
01:13:39.582,01:13:40.833,How much time do we have?
01:13:40.833,01:13:43.502,We have two minutes.
01:13:48.383,01:13:50.051,Jeez!
01:13:50.051,01:13:51.969,Such a bitch.
01:13:59.560,01:14:02.521,I know this is different...
01:14:02.521,01:14:09.820,"I mean, from anything we've ever done, and I know you might hate it and think I'm completely crazy..."
01:14:11.072,01:14:15.826,"but I won't care, even if I get fired, and I don't mean that disrespectfully."
01:14:15.826,01:14:18.913,It's just that I've realized something.
01:14:20.706,01:14:22.250,Who are these women?
01:14:22.250,01:14:25.586,Does anyone know?
01:14:25.586,01:14:28.298,I don't recognize any of 'em.
01:14:32.551,01:14:34.929,I want to see...
01:14:34.929,01:14:38.099,my best friend's big sister...
01:14:38.099,01:14:39.934,and...
01:14:39.934,01:14:42.019,the girls from the soccer team.
01:14:43.646,01:14:45.564,My next-door neighbor.
01:14:45.564,01:14:49.485,Real women who are smart and pretty and happy to be who they are.
01:14:49.485,01:14:51.988,These are the women to look up to.
01:14:54.657,01:14:56.117,Let's...
01:14:56.117,01:14:58.953,Let's put life back into the magazine...
01:14:58.953,01:15:00.413,and...
01:15:00.413,01:15:04.375,"and fun, and laughter, and silliness, and..."
01:15:04.375,01:15:07.211,I think we all...
01:15:07.211,01:15:11.174,I think all of us want to feel something...
01:15:11.174,01:15:15.261,that we've forgotten or turned our backs on...
01:15:15.261,01:15:19.932,because maybe we didn't realize how much we were leaving behind.
01:15:25.729,01:15:29.608,We need to remember what used to be good.
01:15:36.782,01:15:38.784,If we don't...
01:15:38.784,01:15:43.080,we won't recognize it even if it hits us between the eyes.
01:15:46.334,01:15:48.627,I just...
01:15:51.297,01:15:52.756,Bravo!
01:15:57.761,01:15:59.805,Brilliant.
01:16:03.100,01:16:07.313,We will present this to corporate first thing tomorrow morning.
01:16:11.608,01:16:13.652,So who's this mystery photographer?
01:16:13.652,01:16:14.987,Matt Flamhaff.
01:16:14.987,01:16:16.947,Mm.
01:16:16.947,01:16:19.116,"Uh, Matt. He's Matt."
01:16:19.116,01:16:22.661,"No, no. Is he gay?"
01:16:22.661,01:16:25.540,Are you gay?
01:17:35.401,01:17:37.820,OPERATOR: City listing?
01:17:37.820,01:17:40.364,Sparkle Magazine on Park Avenue.
01:17:40.364,01:17:43.075,RECEPTIONIST: Sparkle Magazine.
01:17:43.075,01:17:44.827,"Trish Sackett, please."
01:17:56.297,01:18:02.219,"Jenna, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but I really have to talk to you."
01:18:02.219,01:18:03.679,"Hey, Beaver."
01:18:05.014,01:18:07.766,"I mean, Matt. I'm sorry."
01:18:07.766,01:18:09.477,"Old habits die hard, you know?"
01:18:09.477,01:18:10.936,Fine. Is Jenna around?
01:18:10.936,01:18:14.440,Are you here about your photos?
01:18:14.440,01:18:17.860,"No, actually, I'm not."
01:18:17.860,01:18:20.070,I guess I should just tell you that...
01:18:20.070,01:18:25.034,"that Jenna's decided to go in a different direction, with a more..."
01:18:25.034,01:18:27.036,established photographer.
01:18:27.036,01:18:33.501,"She actually is gonna use the guy who shoots all the official photos of her sweetie pie, so..."
01:18:33.501,01:18:38.005,"don't take it personally, because there's just a little bias."
01:18:38.005,01:18:41.258,"I'm sorry to be so honest with you, because..."
01:18:41.258,01:18:44.178,I think your pictures are really cute.
01:18:44.178,01:18:46.055,It was nice talking to you.
01:18:46.055,01:18:49.725,"Hey, Matt, while I've got you here, do you want to sign a general release?"
01:18:49.725,01:18:52.228,Maybe we can use your pictures in a catalog or something.
01:18:52.228,01:18:54.605,Fine.
01:19:56.333,01:19:57.918,Hi.
01:19:57.918,01:19:59.503,"Jenny, right?"
01:19:59.503,01:20:02.089,Jenna.
01:20:02.089,01:20:03.674,I was just looking for Matt.
01:20:03.674,01:20:08.304,"I wanted to tell him some really, really great news about his photographs."
01:20:08.304,01:20:10.514,"Oh, that's great. I'll tell him when he gets back."
01:20:10.514,01:20:11.848,He's just out getting his tux.
01:20:11.848,01:20:14.017,His tux?
01:20:14.017,01:20:15.311,Men.
01:20:15.311,01:20:17.104,Everything is the last minute.
01:20:17.104,01:20:19.398,"I mean, hello, we're getting married tomorrow."
01:20:19.398,01:20:23.152,This'll be the cutest little backyard wedding since I-don't-know-when.
01:20:23.152,01:20:25.655,Congratulations.
01:20:25.655,01:20:27.239,Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.
01:20:27.239,01:20:29.659,Okay.
01:20:39.042,01:20:42.045,JENNA: We want to feel something again that we've...
01:20:42.045,01:20:44.047,forgotten...
01:20:44.047,01:20:48.135,because we didn't stop to notice how much we were leaving behind.
01:20:48.135,01:20:57.060,We need to remember what used to be good-- You ready?
01:20:58.979,01:21:00.397,"The meeting's cancelled, Jenna."
01:21:00.397,01:21:02.483,"What, until tomorrow?"
01:21:02.483,01:21:04.527,It's over.
01:21:05.820,01:21:07.738,It's over?
01:21:07.738,01:21:10.449,Lucy.
01:21:10.449,01:21:12.535,She took all your designs to Sparkle.
01:21:12.535,01:21:14.161,Everything.
01:21:14.161,01:21:16.121,She's their new editor in chief.
01:21:16.121,01:21:18.708,Your photos showed up in Sparkle Online last night.
01:21:18.708,01:21:23.462,Today they're in the outdoor ads everywhere. I mean-- She can't take Matt's pictures.
01:21:23.462,01:21:26.590,She can't do it.
01:21:26.590,01:21:28.467,She got him to sign this.
01:21:35.808,01:21:37.560,"Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures."
01:21:37.560,01:21:39.562,"Oh, which one do you want to be today?"
01:21:39.562,01:21:41.104,The pot or the kettle?
01:21:41.104,01:21:43.065,"If you don't mind, I'd like to be the pot."
01:21:43.065,01:21:44.775,Maybe the kettle.
01:21:44.775,01:21:46.902,It doesn't really matter.
01:21:46.902,01:21:48.278,What are you talking about?
01:21:48.278,01:21:50.155,I found this in your office yesterday.
01:21:50.155,01:21:51.699,Does it look familiar to you?
01:21:51.699,01:21:53.200,It has your name on it.
01:21:53.200,01:21:54.951,You went through my things?
01:21:54.951,01:21:56.453,"Oh, give me a break."
01:21:56.453,01:21:58.914,How horrible.
01:21:58.914,01:22:00.999,What is this?
01:22:00.999,01:22:07.256,"Okay, you can wipe off the doe-eyed-Bambi- watching-her-mother-get-shot and-strapped to-the-back -of-a-van look from your face."
01:22:07.256,01:22:09.049,I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.
01:22:09.049,01:22:12.469,"It's okay, Jenna. I know all about your little deal."
01:22:12.469,01:22:14.597,"It's a sweet, little deal, actually."
01:22:14.597,01:22:17.808,Editor in chief if you help them hit a million copies?
01:22:17.808,01:22:19.226,So you'd give 'em tips.
01:22:19.226,01:22:21.019,"Oh, my God."
01:22:21.019,01:22:23.397,I just wish I would've thought of it.
01:22:23.397,01:22:25.148,"Oh, no."
01:22:25.148,01:22:32.489,"Oh, yes. Only now, I'm taking your job, and you can stay here with the magazine that you single-handedly flushed down the toilet."
01:22:32.489,01:22:34.032,What about Matt?
01:22:34.032,01:22:36.243,Why did he sign this?
01:22:36.243,01:22:39.246,Let's see.
01:22:36.243,01:22:44.585,"I think that I told him you had decided to go in a different direction, which you are now."
01:22:46.044,01:22:50.424,"I might have told him something else too, but I just can't remember."
01:24:03.706,01:24:07.626,"George Washington Bridge, New Jersey!"
01:24:18.804,01:24:20.222,Jenna.
01:24:20.222,01:24:21.765,Jenna Rink.
01:24:21.765,01:24:23.017,Yeah?
01:24:23.017,01:24:25.019,Chris Grandy.
01:24:26.228,01:24:28.438,"So, what are you doing?"
01:24:28.438,01:24:31.191,"Because if you're single, I'd definitely want a number."
01:24:31.191,01:24:33.652,"We could get together, you know."
01:24:33.652,01:24:35.404,I'm still living at home.
01:24:35.404,01:24:36.864,"JENNA: Come on, Grandy. Come on."
01:24:38.323,01:24:40.116,CHRIS: Holy Christ!
01:24:38.323,01:24:42.411,"This is the tune we first tangled tongues to, huh?"
01:24:42.411,01:24:43.829,What's the dude who sings this?
01:24:43.829,01:24:45.121,Uh...
01:24:45.121,01:24:46.749,Rick Springsteen. Yeah.
01:24:46.749,01:24:49.125,"It's Springfield, Grandy. I'm out of here."
01:24:49.125,01:24:53.547,"Well, what-- I thought you wanted my number!"
01:25:17.988,01:25:20.407,I'll take these.
01:25:21.867,01:25:23.493,Good afternoon.
01:25:23.493,01:25:25.704,"WOMAN: Oh, that was a beautiful brunch."
01:25:25.704,01:25:27.039,"You remember, Wayne."
01:25:27.039,01:25:30.459,It was with the Flamhaffs at San Ysidro Ranch.
01:25:30.459,01:25:31.794,Oh.
01:25:31.794,01:25:34.337,San Ysidro Ranch.
01:25:52.106,01:25:54.524,Hi.
01:25:54.524,01:25:56.860,Hey.
01:26:02.950,01:26:06.286,"I don't know what Lucy said to you about me, but I want you to know that..."
01:26:06.286,01:26:10.958,whoever that was she was talking about...
01:26:10.958,01:26:13.335,wasn't me.
01:26:13.335,01:26:15.378,Uh...
01:26:15.378,01:26:17.006,it doesn't matter what Lucy said.
01:26:17.006,01:26:21.384,I stopped trusting her after she stole my Pop Rocks in the third grade.
01:26:23.012,01:26:26.264,Matt...
01:26:26.264,01:26:32.062,I am not the awful person that I know that I was.
01:26:32.062,01:26:38.819,"I don't even know that person, and I'd like to believe..."
01:26:38.819,01:26:54.626,"I have to believe that if you knew that, if in your heart, you really, really knew that, you wouldn't be getting ready to marry someone right now unless that someone were me."
01:27:06.638,01:27:08.098,"Jenna, I'm not..."
01:27:08.098,01:27:10.726,I'm not gonna lie to you.
01:27:10.726,01:27:13.311,"You know, I..."
01:27:13.311,01:27:15.814,I have felt things...
01:27:15.814,01:27:19.109,these past few weeks...
01:27:19.109,01:27:21.904,that I didn't know I could feel anymore...
01:27:24.364,01:27:29.369,but I have realized in these past few days...
01:27:29.369,01:27:33.248,you can't just turn back time.
01:27:33.248,01:27:35.751,Why not?
01:27:37.169,01:27:38.628,I moved on.
01:27:38.628,01:27:40.505,You moved on.
01:27:40.505,01:27:43.884,We've gone down different paths for so long.
01:27:43.884,01:27:46.302,We made choices. I...
01:27:46.302,01:27:48.764,I chose Wendy.
01:27:51.600,01:27:54.978,That's her family down there.
01:27:54.978,01:27:58.774,"We care about each other, you know?"
01:27:58.774,01:28:04.738,"You know, you don't always get the dream house, but you get awfully close."
01:28:06.740,01:28:12.913,"Please don't cry, Jenna. I-- No, I'll be fine, I promise."
01:28:43.568,01:28:45.821,"Matty, can I have it?"
01:28:45.821,01:28:47.030,Please.
01:28:47.030,01:28:49.074,You're not gonna whip it at me?
01:28:49.074,01:28:50.284,No.
01:28:50.284,01:28:52.786,Yeah.
01:28:57.332,01:29:01.295,"Look, I won't have you be late, so go."
01:29:01.295,01:29:03.463,Go on. I'm fine.
01:29:03.463,01:29:05.966,I'm just crying because I'm happy.
01:29:05.966,01:29:08.468,"I want you to be so, so happy."
01:29:10.637,01:29:12.806,"I love you, Matt."
01:29:16.059,01:29:18.270,You're my best friend.
01:29:20.730,01:29:23.025,"Jenna, I..."
01:29:23.025,01:29:27.070,I've always loved you.
01:31:28.900,01:31:33.280,Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.
01:31:42.914,01:31:45.250,Matty!
01:31:51.298,01:31:52.674,Wow.
01:31:52.674,01:31:54.259,You really know what you're doing.
01:31:54.259,01:31:56.594,Come on.
01:31:57.637,01:31:59.806,Sorry.
01:31:59.806,01:32:01.016,You know what?
01:32:01.016,01:32:05.145,"You can be the pot and the kettle all by yourself from now on, beyotch."
01:32:05.145,01:32:06.980,"Come on, Matt."
01:32:06.980,01:32:09.024,What did you call me?
01:32:09.024,01:32:11.109,For what?
01:33:04.578,01:33:05.997,"A Razzle, Mr. Flamhaff?"
01:33:05.997,01:33:10.210,"Mm. Thank you, Mrs. Flamhaff."
