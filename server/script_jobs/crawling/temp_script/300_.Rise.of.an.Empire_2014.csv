00:00:58.375,00:00:59.583,A PROPHECY.
00:00:59.625,00:01:03.083,SPARTA WILL FALL.
00:01:03.125,00:01:06.750,ALL OF GREECE WILL FALL.
00:01:11.959,00:01:16.834,AND PERSIAN FIRE WILL REDUCE ATHENS TO CINDER.
00:01:16.875,00:01:22.166,FOR ATHENS IS A PILE OF STONE AND WOOD AND CLOTH AND DUST.
00:01:22.208,00:01:25.792,"AND AS DUST, WILL VANISH INTO THE WIND."
00:01:25.834,00:01:29.208,ONLY THE ATHENIANS THEMSELVES EXIST.
00:01:29.250,00:01:32.917,AND THE FATE OF THE WORLD HANGS ON THEIR EVERY SYLLABLE.
00:01:37.583,00:01:40.458,ONLY THE ATHENIANS EXIST.
00:01:41.959,00:01:45.875,AND ONLY STOUT WOODEN SHIPS CAN SAVE THEM.
00:01:45.917,00:01:48.250,WOODEN SHIPS...
00:01:48.291,00:01:51.458,AND A TIDAL WAVE OF HEROES' BLOOD.
00:02:00.291,00:02:03.417,"LEONIDAS, MY HUSBAND..."
00:02:03.458,00:02:06.709,"LEONIDAS, YOUR KING..."
00:02:06.750,00:02:10.750,LEONIDAS AND THE BRAVE 300 ARE DEAD.
00:02:10.792,00:02:17.291,THE FREE MEN AND WOMEN OF GREECE ARE NOT BOUND BY A BEAUTIFUL SPARTAN DEATH.
00:02:17.333,00:02:19.125,WAR IS NOT THEIR LOVE.
00:02:19.166,00:02:22.000,YET HE LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THEM.
00:02:22.041,00:02:24.375,FOR THE PROMISE GREECE HOLDS.
00:02:26.083,00:02:32.083,'TIS OUR ENEMIES WHO FORGED OUR FREEDOM IN THE FIRES OF WAR.
00:02:32.125,00:02:35.709,IT WAS KING DARIUS WHO CAME TO TAKE OUR LAND.
00:02:35.750,00:02:44.500,"TEN YEARS AGO, WHEN YOUTH STILL BURNED IN OUR EYES, BEFORE THIS BITTER WAR FORCED OUR CHILDREN TO BECOME MEN."
00:02:44.542,00:02:54.208,"TEN YEARS AGO, THIS WAR BEGAN AS ALL WARS BEGIN: WITH A GRIEVANCE."
00:02:56.542,00:02:59.375,MARATHON.
00:02:59.417,00:03:08.083,"THE PERSIAN KING, DARIUS, ANNOYED BY THE NOTION OF GREEK FREEDOM, HAS COME TO GREECE TO BRING US TO HEEL."
00:03:08.125,00:03:16.959,HE MAKES LANDFALL AT THE FIELD OF MARATHON WITH AN INVADING FORCE WHICH OUTNUMBERS THE GREEK DEFENDERS THREE TO ONE.
00:03:17.000,00:03:20.917,"AND SO AT DAWN, THE HOPELESS ATHENIANS DO THE UNTHINKABLE."
00:03:20.959,00:03:23.250,THEY ATTACK.
00:03:23.291,00:03:30.333,THEY ATTACK THE WEARY PERSIANS AS THEY DISEMBARK THEIR SHIPS ON SHAKY LEGS AFTER A MONTH AT SEA.
00:03:30.375,00:03:34.709,THEY ATTACK BEFORE THEY CAN ESTABLISH THEIR WAR CAMP AND SUPPLY THEIR SOLDIERS.
00:03:34.750,00:03:39.458,AND WHO IS THE ARCHITECT OF THIS MAD STRATEGY?
00:03:39.500,00:03:42.625,A LITTLE-KNOWN ATHENIAN SOLDIER.
00:03:42.667,00:03:46.750,HIS MEN CALL HIM THEMISTOKLES.
00:03:46.792,00:03:51.166,HE GIVES THE PERSIANS A TASTE OF ATHENIAN SHOCK COMBAT.
00:06:12.625,00:06:16.291,Queen Gorgo: ALL THOUGHTS OF GLORY ARE GONE.
00:06:16.333,00:06:17.667,THOUSANDS DEAD.
00:06:17.709,00:06:20.417,HUNDREDS OF THEM THEIR OWN.
00:06:22.709,00:06:25.709,ALL FOR AN IDEA: A FREE GREECE...
00:06:25.750,00:06:29.458,AN ATHENIAN EXPERIMENT CALLED DEMOCRACY.
00:06:32.542,00:06:35.375,COULD THIS IDEA BE WORTH IT?
00:06:35.417,00:06:38.583,WORTH ALL THIS SACRIFICE?
00:06:38.625,00:06:42.709,THEMISTOKLES WOULD LET THE GOOD KING DARIUS DECIDE.
00:06:45.875,00:06:50.250,Queen Gorgo: FOR THROUGH THE CHAOS A MOMENT APPEARED.
00:06:52.834,00:06:56.709,AND THEMISTOKLES WOULD SEIZE IT.
00:07:05.000,00:07:08.917,A MOMENT THAT WOULD RING ACROSS THE CENTURIES.
00:07:08.959,00:07:14.667,A MOMENT THAT WOULD RAISE HIM FROM SIMPLE SOLDIER TO THE HEIGHT OF ATHENIAN POLITICAL POWER.
00:07:19.458,00:07:23.166,A MOMENT THAT WOULD MAKE THEMISTOKLES A LEGEND.
00:07:41.625,00:07:48.917,"YET EVEN AS THE PRAISE AND GLORY WERE HEAPED UPON HIM, THEMISTOKLES KNEW IN HIS HEART HE HAD MADE A MISTAKE."
00:07:48.959,00:07:55.458,"IT WAS DARIUS'S SON, XERXES, WHOSE EYES HAD THE STINK OF DESTINY ABOUT THEM."
00:07:55.500,00:08:00.083,THEMISTOKLES KNEW HE SHOULD HAVE KILLED THAT BOY.
00:08:00.125,00:08:05.000,THAT GLORIOUS MISTAKE WOULD FOREVER HAUNT HIM.
00:08:10.458,00:08:21.250,AND SO IT WAS THEMISTOKLES HIMSELF WHO SENT A RIPPLE ACROSS THE PERSIAN EMPIRE AND SET INTO MOTION FORCES THAT WOULD BRING FIRE TO THE HEART OF GREECE.
00:08:21.291,00:08:31.041,"FOR AS THE GOOD KING LAY DYING, ALL HIS GREATEST GENERALS AND ADVISORS WERE SUMMONED TO HIS BEDSIDE."
00:08:31.083,00:08:36.375,"NONE GREATER THAN HIS FINEST NAVAL COMMANDER, ARTEMISIA."
00:08:36.417,00:08:39.208,HER FEROCITY BESTED ONLY BY HER BEAUTY.
00:08:39.250,00:08:42.917,HER BEAUTY MATCHED ONLY BY HER DEVOTION TO HER KING.
00:08:48.250,00:08:55.041,DARIUS FAVORED ARTEMISIA AMONG HIS GENERALS FOR SHE HAD BROUGHT HIM VICTORY ON THE BATTLEFIELD.
00:08:55.083,00:09:00.959,"IN HER, HE HAD THE PERFECT WARRIOR PROTéGéE THAT HIS SON XERXES WOULD NEVER BE."
00:09:05.250,00:09:09.250,"SO SWEET, MY CHILD."
00:09:09.291,00:09:12.166,MY SWEET...
00:09:12.208,00:09:14.041,CHILD.
00:09:21.875,00:09:24.083,FATHER.
00:09:24.125,00:09:26.500,XERXES.
00:09:26.542,00:09:31.542,DO NOT REPEAT YOUR FATHER'S MISTAKE.
00:09:31.583,00:09:35.375,LEAVE THE IGNOBLE GREEKS TO THEIR WAYS.
00:09:35.417,00:09:40.375,ONLY THE GODS CAN DEFEAT THEM.
00:09:40.417,00:09:43.792,ONLY...THE GODS.
00:09:54.208,00:09:57.792,"Queen Gorgo: FOR SEVEN DAYS, XERXES MOURNED..."
00:09:57.834,00:09:59.875,PARALYZED BY GRIEF.
00:09:59.917,00:10:05.333,"ON THE EIGHTH DAY, ARTEMISIA WHISPERED THE SEED OF MADNESS THAT WOULD CONSUME HIM."
00:10:05.375,00:10:09.542,YOUR FATHER'S WORDS WERE NOT A WARNING...
00:10:09.583,00:10:12.083,BUT A CHALLENGE.
00:10:12.125,00:10:16.542,ONLY THE GODS CAN DEFEAT THE GREEKS?
00:10:18.834,00:10:23.625,YOU WILL BE A GOD-KING.
00:10:26.625,00:10:32.542,"ARTEMISIA GATHERED THE PRIESTS, WIZARDS AND MYSTICS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE EMPIRE."
00:10:32.583,00:10:37.959,THEY WRAPPED THE YOUNG KING IN CIMMERIAN GAUZE DIPPED IN ANCIENT POTIONS...
00:10:38.000,00:10:40.667,AND SET HIM TO WANDER THE DESERT...
00:10:40.709,00:10:46.458,"TILL IN A DELIRIUM OF HEAT AND THIRST, HE STUMBLED UPON A HERMITS' CAVE."
00:10:49.792,00:10:59.333,XERXES PASSED THE VACANT EYES AND EMPTY SOULS OF THE HOLLOW CREATURES THAT DWELL IN THE DARK CORNERS OF ALL MEN'S HEARTS.
00:11:01.250,00:11:10.417,"AND IN THAT DARKNESS, HE SURRENDERED HIMSELF COMPLETELY TO POWER SO EVIL AND PERVERSE..."
00:11:13.709,00:11:19.792,"...THAT, AS HE EMERGED, NO PART OF A HUMAN MAN THAT WAS XERXES SURVIVED."
00:11:27.417,00:11:31.542,HIS EYES BLAZED LIKE SCARLET COALS.
00:11:31.583,00:11:38.792,"HE WAS STRIPPED, CLEANSED, GLABROUS AND SMOOTH."
00:11:40.166,00:11:44.125,XERXES WAS REBORN A GOD.
00:11:47.875,00:11:50.959,ARTEMISIA TRUSTED NO ONE.
00:11:51.000,00:11:58.000,"SO, IN THE COVER OF NIGHT THE PALACE WAS CLEANSED OF ALL XERXES' ALLIES."
00:12:00.166,00:12:03.083,ALL THOSE HE TRUSTED.
00:12:06.250,00:12:10.041,ALL THOSE WHO HAD RAISED HIM.
00:12:13.792,00:12:21.458,ALL THOSE HE HAD ONCE LOOKED TO FOR COUNSEL WERE QUICKLY INTRODUCED TO HER WRATH.
00:12:46.583,00:12:54.917,"AND AS THE GOD-KING STOOD BEFORE HIS PEOPLE, ARTEMISIA WATCHED HER FLAWLESS MANIPULATION TAKE SHAPE."
00:12:54.959,00:12:57.917,Both: FOR GLORY'S SAKE...
00:12:57.959,00:13:01.041,FOR VENGEANCE'S SAKE...
00:13:01.083,00:13:04.250,WAR!
00:13:04.291,00:13:06.333,...WAR!
00:13:08.667,00:13:15.333,Queen Gorgo: WAR IS COMING TO GREECE IN THE VISAGE OF A MONSTER ARMY OVER A MILLION STRONG.
00:13:15.375,00:13:23.667,"IT SHOULD BE LITTLE MORE THAN A FORMALITY FOR THEMISTOKLES, THE HERO OF MARATHON, TO FINISH WHAT HE BEGAN."
00:13:23.709,00:13:25.500,PLEASE!
00:13:25.542,00:13:28.458,WE MUST APPEAL TO XERXES' REASON!
00:13:28.500,00:13:32.250,COWARD!
00:13:32.291,00:13:34.500,SHUT YOUR COCK HOLE!
00:13:34.542,00:13:36.625,I'LL KILL YOU!
00:13:36.667,00:13:38.166,FUCK THOSE MUSCLE-BOUND BOY-LOVERS!
00:13:38.208,00:13:39.458,SILENCE!
00:13:39.500,00:13:41.542,Man: SILENCE FOR THE HERO OF MARATHON!
00:13:41.583,00:13:43.709,"THIS IS A DEMOCRACY, NOT A STREET FIGHT."
00:13:43.750,00:13:46.000,QUIET!
00:13:46.041,00:13:49.834,THE PERSIAN ATTACK WILL COME FROM BOTH THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH.
00:13:49.875,00:13:52.667,THE CITY-STATES SHOULD NEGOTIATE A TRUCE.
00:13:52.709,00:13:55.250,"YES, YES, WE MUST NEGOTIATE."
00:13:55.291,00:13:57.834,NEGOTIATE WITH TYRANNY?
00:13:57.875,00:14:02.041,GIVE ME ONE EXAMPLE OF WHEN THAT HAS EVER PROFITED A NATION.
00:14:02.083,00:14:03.750,YOU'RE RIGHT.
00:14:03.792,00:14:05.041,MY FELLOW COUNTRYMEN...
00:14:05.083,00:14:11.000,WE CAN ONLY JUDGE THE FUTURE FROM WHAT WE HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST.
00:14:11.041,00:14:15.333,"NOW, MANY OF YOU HERE STOOD WITH ME AT MARATHON..."
00:14:15.375,00:14:24.208,"AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SERVED AND FACED THE CUT AND THRUST OF BATTLE, YOU KNOW HOW TRUE PEACE IS FORGED."
00:14:24.250,00:14:26.166,DO NOT BE DECEIVED.
00:14:26.208,00:14:30.917,"XERXES, THE SON OF DARIUS, IS A WOLF AT OUR DOOR."
00:14:30.959,00:14:33.875,"RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW..."
00:14:33.917,00:14:39.542,WE MUST CHOOSE: DO WE STAND AND FIGHT FOR GREECE OR NOT?
00:14:39.583,00:14:41.250,ARGOS...
00:14:41.291,00:14:43.291,CORINTH...
00:14:43.333,00:14:45.125,MEGARA...
00:14:45.166,00:14:46.709,ATHENS.
00:14:46.750,00:14:49.458,NOT EVEN SPARTA CAN MATCH THE PERSIANS ALONE.
00:14:49.500,00:14:51.792,WE MUST PERSEVERE AS ONE NATION.
00:14:51.834,00:14:56.792,OR WE WILL PERISH CLINGING ONTO OUR OWN SELF-INTERESTS.
00:14:56.834,00:15:00.709,SEND US THE SHIPS THAT WE NEED TO DEFEND GREECE.
00:15:00.750,00:15:03.291,THEMISTOKLES WILL NEED MORE THAN OUR CITIES' SHIPS.
00:15:03.333,00:15:05.583,HE WILL NEED OUR CHILDREN TO JOIN THE FIGHT.
00:15:07.500,00:15:09.041,AND WHAT OF SPARTA?
00:15:09.083,00:15:14.917,YOU SEND EVERY SHIP THAT WE HAVE TO THE NORTHERN COAST OF EUBOEA.
00:15:14.959,00:15:19.625,I WILL GO AND SEEK THE HELP OF THE GREAT SPARTANS.
00:15:41.083,00:15:45.250,STILL NO WORD FROM THE MESSENGER YOU SENT TO SPARTA.
00:15:45.291,00:15:49.000,KING LEONIDAS MAY HAVE BEEN INSULTED BY YOUR GENEROUS OFFER.
00:15:49.041,00:15:53.083,PERHAPS I NEED TO MARCH INTO SPARTA MYSELF AND BURN IT TO THE GROUND.
00:15:54.709,00:15:56.166,REMEMBER...
00:15:56.208,00:15:59.166,WHEN A KING IS LOVED AS I AM...
00:15:59.208,00:16:02.959,MUCH CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.
00:16:03.000,00:16:07.250,THEY WOULD BE FOOLS TO RESIST MY DIVINE POWER.
00:16:07.291,00:16:10.291,ATHENS IS ATTEMPTING TO ASSEMBLE A COALITION.
00:16:10.333,00:16:14.125,IT'LL BE NOTHING MORE THAN A PATCHWORK OF SHIPS.
00:16:14.166,00:16:19.000,"ONCE THESE WATERS HAVE BEEN TRAVERSED, I WILL LEAD MY FORCE ACROSS THE LAND."
00:16:19.041,00:16:25.250,I WILL REMIND THE COWARDS OF GREECE THAT WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THEIR INSOLENCE.
00:16:34.208,00:16:36.583,REST AND WATER THE HORSES.
00:16:36.625,00:16:38.625,IT'S BEST I GO ALONE.
00:16:38.667,00:16:43.166,SPARTANS DON'T GET ALONG WELL WITH OTHERS.
00:17:08.792,00:17:11.208,AAH!
00:17:32.625,00:17:35.583,SPARTANS.
00:17:35.625,00:17:37.000,Dilios: THEMISTOKLES.
00:17:37.041,00:17:38.458,YOU OLD SNAKE.
00:17:38.500,00:17:40.041,WHAT BRINGS YOU THIS FAR SOUTH?
00:17:40.083,00:17:43.208,I'VE COME TO SEE LEONIDAS TO WARN HIM THAT THE PERSIANS ARE ON THE MARCH.
00:17:43.250,00:17:44.667,"WELL, YOU'RE TOO LATE."
00:17:44.709,00:17:48.041,PERSIAN MESSENGER ALREADY PRESENTED HIS TERMS TO LEONIDAS.
00:17:48.083,00:17:51.917,SYMBOLIC OFFERING OF EARTH AND WATER.
00:17:59.667,00:18:02.500,SPARTANS!
00:18:03.834,00:18:06.875,THAT ANY SPARTAN'S FINEST MOMENT...
00:18:06.917,00:18:10.834,THE GREATEST FULFILLMENT OF ALL HE HOLDS DEAR...
00:18:10.875,00:18:12.417,IS THAT MOMENT...
00:18:12.458,00:18:17.875,WHEN HE HAS FOUGHT HIS HEART OUT FOR THE PRESERVATION OF SPARTA...
00:18:17.917,00:18:21.458,AND LIES DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD...
00:18:21.500,00:18:24.291,VICTORIOUS.
00:18:24.333,00:18:29.000,"NOW, WHO IS WILLING TO DIE AT OUR KING'S SIDE?"
00:18:32.959,00:18:35.667,THEMISTOKLES.
00:18:35.709,00:18:40.709,YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY TO STROKE YOUR COCK WHILST WATCHING REAL MEN TRAIN.
00:18:40.750,00:18:42.208,Themistokles: QUEEN GORGO.
00:18:42.250,00:18:46.333,SHOULDN'T HE BE TRAINING THEM TO LIVE AT THEIR KING'S SIDE?
00:18:46.375,00:18:50.500,"A NEW AGE IS DAWNING, GORGO."
00:18:50.542,00:18:55.125,WON'T BE LONG BEFORE MEN RISE UP AND SHED THE YOKE OF MYSTICISM AND TYRANNY.
00:18:55.166,00:18:57.458,THAT SOUNDS LIKE A THREAT.
00:18:57.500,00:19:01.917,AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN THE REST OF FREE GREECE AND STAND AGAINST A TRUE TYRANT...
00:19:01.959,00:19:07.083,"UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU AND LEONIDAS HAVE ALREADY MADE A DEAL WITH XERXES."
00:19:07.125,00:19:09.709,NO TERMS WERE REACHED.
00:19:09.750,00:19:11.625,XERXES' MESSENGER WAS...
00:19:11.667,00:19:13.792,"WELL, HE WAS RUDE AND LACKED RESPECT."
00:19:13.834,00:19:18.583,HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE SAME THREATS MADE IN THEBES AND ATHENS WOULD NOT WORK HERE.
00:19:18.625,00:19:23.750,THIS IS THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST WARRIORS.
00:19:23.792,00:19:27.792,MEN WHOSE KING WOULD STAND AND FIGHT AND DIE FOR ANY ONE OF THEM.
00:19:27.834,00:19:33.291,XERXES' MESSENGER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THIS IS NO TYPICAL GREEK CITY-STATE.
00:19:35.709,00:19:39.000,THIS IS SPARTA.
00:19:39.041,00:19:42.667,SO IT WAS CLEAR TO THE MESSENGER THERE WOULD BE NO SPARTAN SUBMISSION.
00:19:42.709,00:19:44.166,IT WAS CLEAR.
00:19:44.208,00:19:47.500,"EVEN NOW, LEONIDAS IS IN COUNSEL WITH THE ORACLE OVER HIS BATTLE PLAN."
00:19:47.542,00:19:50.417,THE FESTIVAL OF THE CARNEA IS ALL THAT STANDS IN OUR WAY.
00:19:50.458,00:19:53.375,"SURELY, THE ORACLE WILL SEE WE MUST FIGHT."
00:19:53.417,00:19:55.250,"WELL, THEN MY TIMING IS PERFECT."
00:19:55.291,00:19:59.166,I AM COMMANDING A FLEET OF SHIPS THAT WILL REPRESENT A UNITED GREECE.
00:19:59.208,00:20:01.583,I NEED SPARTA TO JOIN ME.
00:20:01.625,00:20:04.041,"GIVE ME YOUR SHIPS, GORGO."
00:20:04.083,00:20:07.083,I WILL MAKE SURE THAT XERXES WISHES HE NEVER CROSSED THE AEGEAN.
00:20:07.125,00:20:08.709,YOU WILL RECEIVE NO SPARTAN SHIPS.
00:20:08.750,00:20:10.583,WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN A UNITED GREECE.
00:20:10.625,00:20:13.125,"THAT IS YOUR DREAM, THEMISTOKLES, NOT OURS."
00:20:13.166,00:20:16.208,ALL I AM CONCERNED WITH IS THE PRESERVATION OF SPARTA.
00:20:18.166,00:20:20.625,MY GUARDS WILL SEE YOU OUT.
00:20:22.291,00:20:26.792,IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU MOCK FREEDOM HERE IN YOUR SELFISH ISOLATION.
00:20:26.834,00:20:32.417,"YET, FREEDOM, IN HER WISDOM, HAS CHOSEN YOU TO DEFEND HER."
00:20:34.750,00:20:36.625,MY QUEEN.
00:20:38.959,00:20:43.041,WILL SPARTA JOIN OUR FIGHT?
00:20:43.083,00:20:46.458,"APPARENTLY, THE PERSIANS HAVE OFFERED THE SPARTANS SOMETHING THEY CANNOT REFUSE."
00:20:46.500,00:20:48.583,AND WHAT IS THAT?
00:20:48.625,00:20:50.875,A BEAUTIFUL DEATH.
00:21:09.083,00:21:12.500,THEY SAY YOU ARE THE BRAVEST OF OUR CAPTIVES.
00:21:12.542,00:21:16.583,THEY SAY YOU ARE A WHORE FROM THE EASTERN SEAS.
00:21:19.291,00:21:22.083,YOU'RE NOT THE SMARTEST.
00:21:24.333,00:21:27.041,YOUR COMMANDER IS A GREEK.
00:21:27.083,00:21:29.125,JUST LIKE ME.
00:21:29.166,00:21:33.792,YOU PERSIAN MEN TAKE YOUR ORDERS FROM A GREEK WOMAN.
00:21:33.834,00:21:35.375,"YES, MY BROTHER."
00:21:35.417,00:21:37.375,I AM GREEK BY BIRTH...
00:21:37.417,00:21:40.625,AND I HAVE GREEK BLOOD RUNNING THROUGH MY VEINS.
00:21:43.250,00:21:44.959,BUT MY HEART...
00:21:47.500,00:21:48.917,...IS PERSIAN.
00:22:19.709,00:22:22.792,Artemisia: WITHIN HOURS...
00:22:22.834,00:22:25.792,THE GREEK FLEET WILL BE SHATTERED.
00:22:25.834,00:22:29.166,WHAT OF OUR MASTER AND THE MUCH-FEARED SPARTANS?
00:22:29.208,00:22:31.792,THERE'S NOTHING TO FEAR.
00:22:31.834,00:22:38.083,ONLY KING LEONIDAS AND HIS PERSONAL GUARD OF 300 HAVE MARCHED TO FIGHT.
00:22:38.125,00:22:39.291,THEY'LL COLLAPSE INSTANTLY.
00:22:42.333,00:22:43.625,YOU.
00:22:49.709,00:22:51.417,DO YOU AGREE?
00:22:53.542,00:22:55.667,MANY WILL PERISH.
00:22:55.709,00:22:59.792,YOUR CONFIDENCE LEAVES ME WITH A STRONG IMPRESSION.
00:22:59.834,00:23:07.125,IT'S A CURIOUS THING FOR A SIMPLE SHIP GUARD TO NOT LOWER HIS EYES WHEN QUESTIONED BY ME.
00:23:07.166,00:23:11.208,THAT COULD'VE BEEN JUST A LACK OF DISCIPLINE.
00:23:11.250,00:23:14.125,BUT A MAN'S HANDS DO NOT LIE.
00:23:14.166,00:23:19.834,THEY CAN REVEAL EVERY IMPERFECTION AND FLAW IN HIS CHARACTER.
00:23:19.875,00:23:25.750,"YOU SEE, YOUR HANDS ARE NOT ROUGH ENOUGH TO WORK THE RIGGING OF THIS SHIP."
00:23:25.792,00:23:29.583,I KNOW EVERY SINGLE MAN BENEATH MY LASH.
00:23:29.625,00:23:33.667,CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME HOW I DON'T KNOW YOU?
00:23:33.709,00:23:37.667,"FORGIVE ME, COMMANDER."
00:23:40.208,00:23:42.333,LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.
00:23:43.959,00:23:46.375,SEIZE THE SPY.
00:24:02.583,00:24:06.083,COWARD.
00:24:06.125,00:24:09.542,STORM IS UPON US.
00:24:09.583,00:24:14.041,IT'S JUST SOME MAD GREEK WEATHER.
00:24:26.834,00:24:28.250,Scyllias: THEMISTOKLES.
00:24:28.291,00:24:29.667,COME.
00:24:32.291,00:24:34.333,CALISTO.
00:24:34.375,00:24:36.959,WHAT IS SPOKEN HERE MUST NOT BE REPEATED.
00:24:37.000,00:24:39.166,ANYWHERE.
00:24:41.250,00:24:47.583,"MY SON HAS NOT EARNED THE RIGHT TO SIT AT THE TABLE OF COMBAT VETERANS, BUT YOU CAN TRUST HIM."
00:24:47.625,00:24:51.333,TELL ME.
00:24:51.375,00:24:53.834,A GREEK WOMAN COMMANDS ALL OF XERXES' SHIPS TO THE SOUTH.
00:24:53.875,00:24:56.458,ARTEMISIA.
00:24:56.500,00:24:59.750,I KNOW OF HER.
00:24:59.792,00:25:04.875,ARTEMISIA IS MURDEROUS BY TRADE WITH TRUE SKILL ON THE SEA AND SHE HAS THIRST FOR VENGEANCE.
00:25:04.917,00:25:09.583,RUMORS ARE HER ENTIRE FAMILY WAS MURDERED BY A SQUAD OF GREEK HOPLITES.
00:25:09.625,00:25:12.417,I HAVE HEARD ALL THE STORIES.
00:25:12.458,00:25:16.250,AND THE HOPLITES SPARED NO ONE ON THAT DAY.
00:25:42.750,00:25:48.375,THE STORY GOES THAT THEY RAPED AND MURDERED HER ENTIRE FAMILY.
00:25:48.417,00:25:51.667,AND THEN THEY TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TOWARDS HER.
00:26:14.000,00:26:18.792,AFTER YEARS OF BEING KEPT IN THE BOWELS OF A GREEK SLAVE SHIP...
00:26:18.834,00:26:25.667,"SHE WAS DISCARDED AND LEFT FOR DEAD, WHERE SHE WAS FOUND NEAR DEATH BY A PERSIAN EMISSARY."
00:26:45.208,00:26:49.500,ARTEMISIA VOWED THAT DAY TO RETURN TO GREECE...
00:26:49.542,00:26:52.959,ONLY WHEN SHE COULD WATCH IT BURN.
00:27:04.083,00:27:09.250,"SHE WAS FED, CLOTHED AND TRAINED BY THE FINEST WARRIORS OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE..."
00:27:11.792,00:27:13.417,AAH!
00:27:11.792,00:27:15.959,...UNTIL NO MATCH COULD BE FOUND FOR HER SKILLS AND GIFT WITH THE SWORD.
00:27:42.500,00:27:45.583,THE GREAT KING DARIUS WAS IMPRESSED BY HER COMMITMENT.
00:27:45.625,00:27:49.041,AND SHE QUICKLY ROSE TO COMMAND AT HIS SIDE.
00:27:52.000,00:27:56.667,Aeskylos: SHE HAS SOLD HER SOUL TO DEATH HIMSELF.
00:27:56.709,00:27:59.834,"WELL, SOME COULD SAY THAT I'VE SOLD MINE TO GREECE."
00:28:02.500,00:28:05.125,AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?
00:28:05.166,00:28:07.083,ME?
00:28:07.125,00:28:09.166,YOU ARE THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.
00:28:09.208,00:28:11.583,I'M READY TO FIGHT.
00:28:14.125,00:28:17.542,I LIKE HIM.
00:28:17.583,00:28:20.041,WE WILL NEED EVERY LAST MAN.
00:28:20.083,00:28:21.417,"WELL, HE IS STILL JUST A BOY."
00:28:21.458,00:28:23.041,"MUCH YOUNGER HAVE DEFENDED OUR COUNTRY, FATHER."
00:28:23.083,00:28:25.083,ENOUGH!
00:28:25.125,00:28:28.208,YOU ARE A DREAMER AND WILL SPEAK OF THIS NO MORE.
00:28:31.667,00:28:36.959,"THEMISTOKLES, I'VE SET YOUR PLAN IN MOTION AND MY LAND FORCE WILL BE ASSEMBLED BY THE SECOND DAY."
00:28:37.000,00:28:39.125,YOU WILL BE NEEDED.
00:28:39.166,00:28:43.125,I CAN ASSURE YOU OF THAT.
00:28:43.166,00:28:45.208,AND THERE IS BAD NEWS.
00:28:45.250,00:28:49.291,LEONIDAS HAS MARCHED NORTH TO THE HOT GATES.
00:28:49.333,00:28:51.875,Aeskylos: BAD NEWS?
00:28:51.917,00:28:55.458,"WITH THE SPARTANS AT THE HOT GATES, OUR VICTORY IS ASSURED."
00:28:55.500,00:28:56.959,IF THE ARMY WERE WITH HIM.
00:28:57.000,00:29:02.875,"BUT BETWEEN THE ORACLE AND THE CARNEA, LEONIDAS HAS MARCHED TO THERMOPYLAE WITH JUST 300 MEN."
00:29:02.917,00:29:12.458,SO THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN ATHENS AND TOTAL ANNIHILATION IS LEONIDAS AND 300 SPARTANS.
00:29:17.375,00:29:20.083,I WILL SEARCH OUT THE VETERANS AMONG THEM.
00:29:20.125,00:29:22.834,ESTABLISH SOME ORDER AMONG THE VOLUNTEERS.
00:29:22.875,00:29:27.208,GOOD. THERE'S LITTLE TIME TO TEACH THESE FARMHANDS STRATEGY.
00:29:27.250,00:29:29.166,JUST KEEP THEM WELL-FED...
00:29:29.208,00:29:31.291,AND SOBER.
00:29:31.333,00:29:33.166,ANYTHING ELSE?
00:29:33.208,00:29:36.208,WOULDN'T HURT IF THEY COULD SWING A SWORD.
00:29:38.125,00:29:40.834,"WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED."
00:29:40.875,00:29:43.291,SHIT!
00:29:43.333,00:29:44.959,DOES YOUR FATHER KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE?
00:29:45.000,00:29:46.500,"NO, SIR."
00:29:46.542,00:29:48.667,AND THIS SHIELD AND SWORD?
00:29:48.709,00:29:50.083,MY GRANDFATHER'S.
00:29:50.125,00:29:53.250,MY MOTHER ENTRUSTED THEM TO ME THIS MORNING.
00:29:53.291,00:29:55.333,WHEN SHE GAVE YOU HER BLESSING?
00:29:55.375,00:29:57.041,"YES, SIR."
00:29:57.083,00:29:59.417,"WITH A SHARP BLADE, NO LESS."
00:30:01.166,00:30:04.875,YOUR FATHER IS PREPARING A SURPRISE FOR OUR ENEMY TOMORROW.
00:30:04.917,00:30:08.417,I CHOOSE TO FIGHT HERE.
00:30:08.458,00:30:12.166,COME ABOARD MY SHIP.
00:30:12.208,00:30:14.291,THAT IS WHERE YOU WILL FIGHT.
00:30:14.333,00:30:15.750,"YES, SIR."
00:30:18.917,00:30:21.333,Man: WE'VE JUST OVER 50 SHIPS.
00:30:21.375,00:30:24.375,PERSIAN FORCES REPORTED A NUMBER IN THE THOUSANDS.
00:30:24.417,00:30:26.125,THOSE SHIPS APPEAR HARDLY SEAWORTHY.
00:30:26.166,00:30:27.959,THEY'RE NOTHING LIKE THE MONSTER SHIPS OF THE PERSIAN FLEET.
00:30:28.000,00:30:29.500,THEN WE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE.
00:30:29.542,00:30:30.959,SPEED AND MANEUVERABILITY.
00:30:31.000,00:30:34.834,REST OF THE CITY-STATES HAVE SENT ANYWHERE FROM A HANDFUL TO A SINGLE SHIP.
00:30:34.875,00:30:36.917,"OF COURSE, ATHENS SUPPLIED THE BALANCE."
00:30:36.959,00:30:43.750,WE HAVE REPORT THAT A SMALL ADVANCE FORCE OF PERSIAN SHIPS HAVE TAKEN REFUGE FROM THE STORM JUST ACROSS THE STRAIT.
00:30:43.792,00:30:46.709,"IF THE WEATHER BREAKS, WE COULD HIT THEM AT DAWN."
00:30:46.750,00:30:48.834,AN EARLY GREEK VICTORY.
00:30:48.875,00:30:53.000,Man: THE GODS HAVE GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO WOUND THE PERSIANS AND STRENGTHEN GREEK MORALE.
00:30:53.041,00:30:56.333,A TEMPTING DISTRACTION.
00:30:56.375,00:30:58.375,BUT WE'LL STICK TO THE BATTLE PLAN.
00:30:58.417,00:31:02.083,"TODAY AT SUNDOWN, WE WILL SAIL OUT TO MEET THE MAIN PERSIAN FLEET."
00:31:02.125,00:31:05.458,WE'LL ATTACK THEM IN THE OPEN WATER WITH NO SHORE TO NARROW THE BATTLE.
00:31:05.500,00:31:09.417,Man #2: TO ATTACK A FORCE OF OVER A THOUSAND SHIPS WITH OUR MEAGER FORCE IS SUICIDE.
00:31:09.458,00:31:12.834,SUCH IS MY PLAN.
00:31:16.333,00:31:20.375,Artaphernes: LOOK AT THEIR EXCUSE FOR A NAVY.
00:31:20.417,00:31:23.667,THEIR SHIPS ARE OF LITTLE THREAT.
00:31:23.709,00:31:26.000,"I NEED A SECOND IN COMMAND, ARTAPHERNES."
00:31:26.041,00:31:31.583,AND WHOEVER PROVES THEIR EXCELLENCE WILL EARN A PLACE BESIDE ME.
00:31:31.625,00:31:34.625,GENERAL BANDARI HAS OFFERED TO LEAD THE FIRST ATTACK.
00:31:34.667,00:31:38.250,BANDARI.
00:31:38.291,00:31:39.917,COMMANDER.
00:31:39.959,00:31:45.500,"IF I LET YOU LEAD OUR FIRST OFFENSIVE, WHAT GUARANTEE DO I HAVE THAT YOU'LL BRING ME A QUICK VICTORY?"
00:31:45.542,00:31:47.125,MY WORD AND MY LIFE.
00:31:47.166,00:31:49.125,GOOD.
00:31:49.166,00:31:51.208,MY RULES OF ENGAGEMENT?
00:31:51.250,00:31:55.500,HUMILIATE THE GREEKS AND LAY WASTE TO THEIR TINY SHIPS.
00:31:55.542,00:31:59.625,Bandari: THEY'LL BE DEAD TO THE LAST MAN.
00:32:08.917,00:32:11.250,Themistokles: MY BROTHERS...
00:32:11.291,00:32:14.542,STEADY YOUR HEARTS.
00:32:14.583,00:32:17.208,LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR SOULS.
00:32:20.500,00:32:24.917,FOR YOUR METTLE IS TO BE TESTED THIS DAY.
00:32:27.625,00:32:31.166,AND IF IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE...
00:32:31.208,00:32:35.041,YOU NEED A REASON TO FIGHT ON...
00:32:35.083,00:32:41.417,AN IDEA FOR WHICH YOU WILL GIVE UP ALL THAT YOU WILL EVER HAVE...
00:32:41.458,00:32:45.583,YOU NEED ONLY TO LOOK AT THE MAN WHO FIGHTS AT YOUR SIDE.
00:32:45.625,00:32:50.083,THIS IS THE WHY OF BATTLE.
00:32:50.125,00:32:53.709,THIS IS THE BROTHERHOOD OF MEN-AT-ARMS.
00:32:53.750,00:32:59.375,AN UNBREAKABLE BOND MADE STRONGER BY THE CRUCIBLE OF COMBAT.
00:32:59.417,00:33:02.709,YOU WILL NEVER BE CLOSER THAN WITH THOSE WHO YOU SHED YOUR BLOOD WITH.
00:33:04.125,00:33:11.291,FOR THERE IS NO NOBLER CAUSE THAN TO FIGHT FOR THOSE WHO WILL LAY DOWN THEIR LIFE FOR YOU.
00:33:13.542,00:33:16.125,SO YOU FIGHT STRONG TODAY.
00:33:16.166,00:33:19.500,YOU FIGHT FOR YOUR BROTHERS.
00:33:19.542,00:33:22.333,FIGHT FOR YOUR FAMILIES.
00:33:22.375,00:33:25.583,"MOST OF ALL, YOU FIGHT FOR GREECE!"
00:33:25.625,00:33:27.625,All: GREECE!
00:33:27.667,00:33:30.834,YEAH!
00:33:30.875,00:33:34.333,AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THING TO MAKE SURE OF WHEN THE FIGHTING STARTS.
00:33:34.375,00:33:35.583,WHAT'S THAT?
00:33:35.625,00:33:38.500,DON'T GET KILLED ON THE FIRST DAY.
00:33:39.959,00:33:42.208,THAT GOES FOR THE REST OF YOU.
00:34:12.834,00:34:19.417,THE PERSIAN SHIPS ARE STRONG AT THE FRONT BUT THEY ARE WEAK IN THE MIDDLE.
00:34:19.458,00:34:21.208,WE ATTACK THEM THERE.
00:34:31.250,00:34:33.375,NOW!
00:34:54.250,00:34:55.458,ATTACK!
00:35:11.959,00:35:13.875,AAH!
00:35:20.000,00:35:22.083,Persian warrior: AAH!
00:35:23.500,00:35:25.000,RAM THEM!
00:35:35.834,00:35:39.083,"Persian commander: ARCHERS, NOW! NOW!"
00:35:48.166,00:35:51.542,REVERSE! NOW!
00:35:58.166,00:35:59.667,GO THROUGH THEM!
00:36:53.875,00:36:57.250,THE ENEMY'S TACTICS ARE CREATIVE.
00:36:57.291,00:37:00.125,THE DEFENSIVE CIRCLE LEAVES NO FRONT TO ASSAULT.
00:37:00.166,00:37:02.125,WE ARE LOSING.
00:37:02.166,00:37:04.875,"NO, YOU ARE LOSING."
00:37:09.417,00:37:14.000,PULL BACK.
00:37:14.041,00:37:17.083,"I'M BORED WITH YOUR FAILURES, BANDARI."
00:37:21.834,00:37:24.583,I'LL NOT LET THIS WOUND SLOW ME.
00:37:24.625,00:37:26.709,SOMEHOW I BELIEVE YOU.
00:37:26.750,00:37:29.208,MY BLADE WILL BE SHARP AND READY BY THE MORNING.
00:37:29.250,00:37:30.667,GOOD.
00:37:30.709,00:37:33.542,"TOMORROW, YOU WILL FIGHT ALONGSIDE YOUR FATHER."
00:37:35.208,00:37:37.917,NOT BAD FOR A BUNCH OF FARMERS.
00:37:37.959,00:37:39.875,AND POETS AND SCULPTORS.
00:37:39.917,00:37:45.083,WHO'D HAVE KNOWN A GROUP OF UNTRAINED MEN WOULD DO SO WELL AGAINST SUCH A CONSIDERABLE ADVERSARY.
00:37:45.125,00:37:50.709,WE'RE GOING TO NEED ALL OF OUR STRENGTH FOR TOMORROW'S FIGHT.
00:37:50.750,00:37:53.291,HOW LONG DO YOU THINK WE CAN HOLD THEM?
00:37:55.583,00:37:58.208,IF MY PLAN IS TO WORK...
00:38:00.417,00:38:03.667,...LONG ENOUGH FOR THE SPARTANS TO UNITE GREECE.
00:38:03.709,00:38:06.000,MEN!
00:38:06.041,00:38:08.375,WHO WILL SHARE THEIR WINE WITH ME?!
00:38:21.083,00:38:22.750,REPORT.
00:38:22.792,00:38:25.083,WE ARE STILL TALLYING THE LOSSES.
00:38:25.125,00:38:45.125,"BUT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND, IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, GIVEN THE SEA AND THE DARKNESS, TO GET AN ACCURATE -- REPORT?"
00:38:45.166,00:38:47.125,Artaphernes: SEVENTY-FIVE SHIPS LOST.
00:38:47.166,00:38:48.542,THIRTY DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR.
00:38:48.583,00:38:51.959,TWENTY COULD RETURN WITH A FEW WEEKS' WORK IN A SAFE HARBOR.
00:38:55.041,00:38:58.750,THE COMMANDER OF THE GREEK FORCE IS NAMED THEMISTOKLES.
00:38:58.792,00:39:01.125,"YES, HE IS AN ATHENIAN GENERAL."
00:39:01.166,00:39:06.875,HE'S RUMORED TO HAVE LOOSED THE ARROW THAT FELLED THE GREAT KING DARIUS HIMSELF.
00:39:34.917,00:39:40.291,THIS THEMISTOKLES HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE QUITE BRILLIANT IN BATTLE.
00:39:40.333,00:39:43.709,WHICH IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR ANY OF YOU.
00:39:43.750,00:39:47.542,DO YOU GENTLEMEN FIND MY COMMAND UNREASONABLE?
00:39:47.583,00:39:50.542,IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR VICTORY?
00:39:50.583,00:39:55.125,YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT IN YESTERDAY'S LOSSES IS WARRANTED.
00:39:55.166,00:39:58.959,MY DISAPPOINTMENT.
00:39:59.041,00:40:02.375,MY DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT WITH MY LOSSES.
00:40:02.417,00:40:06.458,THE MEAGER NUMBER OF DAMAGED SHIPS AND DEAD SLAVES MEANS NOTHING TO ME.
00:40:06.500,00:40:10.291,"NO, MY DISAPPOINTMENT..."
00:40:12.625,00:40:14.750,...IS IN THESE MEN.

00:46:34.166,00:46:37.041,WHO TOLD YOU THIS?
00:47:11.625,00:47:13.583,AAH!

00:49:16.333,00:49:24.542,AND IS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE YOU NAILED TO THE MAST OF YOUR SHIP WITH HER SWORD AS YOU DESCEND TO A WATERY GRAVE.
00:49:29.291,00:49:32.500,WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY THAT TO BEGIN WITH?

00:50:24.417,00:50:28.208,DO YOU BELIEVE THE GREEKS ARE DESCENDED FROM THE GODS?

00:50:50.834,00:50:56.083,MY MEN ALSO SAY THAT IT WAS YOU WHO SLAYED THE GOOD KING DARIUS AT MARATHON.
00:50:56.125,00:50:58.834,MANY HEROIC DEEDS OCCURRED ON THAT DAY.
00:50:58.875,00:51:04.000,"BUT IT WAS TEN YEARS AGO, AND THE FACTS OF BATTLE ARE OFTEN EMBELLISHED."

00:57:35.709,00:57:39.083,CAN ARTEMISIA BE BEATEN?
00:57:39.125,00:57:42.041,THE NEXT TIME THAT WE FACE HER...
00:57:42.083,00:57:45.709,SHE'S GOING TO BRING ALL OF HELL WITH HER.

01:04:33.667,01:04:39.917,THEMISTOKLES WATCHES THE BODIES OF HIS MEN TURN THE AEGEAN RED WITH BLOOD.
01:04:39.959,01:04:42.959,WERE THEY SACRIFICED FOR HIS EGO?
01:04:43.000,01:04:48.500,OR TO RELIEVE THE GUILT OF THE LONG-AGO MISTAKE AT MARATHON?
01:04:50.750,01:04:56.291,HOW MANY MEN WOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF THEMISTOKLES HAD KILLED THAT BOY?
01:04:58.625,01:05:02.542,NOT EVEN HIS OWN SOUL CAN BE SURE.
01:05:02.583,01:05:05.208,MY FRIEND.
01:05:05.250,01:05:08.291,WE FACED THE ODDS.

01:05:18.542,01:05:21.959,YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT...
01:05:22.000,01:05:24.917,WITH TWICE AS MUCH STRENGTH IN THE MORNING.
01:05:24.959,01:05:28.125,WE WILL FIGHT SHOULDER-TO-SHOULDER.
01:05:28.166,01:05:29.417,"NO, MY SON."
01:05:29.458,01:05:34.458,YOU WILL CARRY ON FOR BOTH OF US.
01:06:31.959,01:06:35.625,WHAT DID HE SAY?
01:06:35.667,01:06:40.333,"I WILL TELL YOU IN TIME, BOY."

01:06:43.000,01:06:45.959,YOU GO AND BE WITH YOUR FATHER'S SPIRIT.
01:06:54.083,01:06:58.917,HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK WE WILL REPEAT SUCH A TRAGEDY?
01:06:58.959,01:07:01.125,AS MANY TIMES AS WE MUST.
01:07:01.166,01:07:04.083,WE ARE TURNING YOUNG MEN INTO MEMORIES.
01:07:06.583,01:07:09.375,DO YOU THINK I ENJOY THIS?
01:07:09.417,01:07:13.125,WITNESSING MY FRIEND'S FINAL BREATH?
01:07:15.583,01:07:19.375,EVERY WIDOW THAT IS MADE BY MY DECISION...
01:07:19.417,01:07:25.709,EVERY CHILD THAT WILL GROW WITHOUT A FATHER...
01:07:25.750,01:07:28.583,THEY ARE MY CHOICES.
01:07:28.625,01:07:32.041,THIS IS THE BURDEN OF MY COMMAND.
01:07:55.291,01:08:01.417,Xerxes: HOW EASY IT IS TO SILENCE THE STRONG AND SELF-DISCIPLINED.
01:08:01.458,01:08:06.291,LET MY ARMY WITNESS THE GREAT WARRIORS OF SPARTA.
01:08:07.792,01:08:10.500,MARCH THEM PAST THESE CORPSES.
01:08:10.542,01:08:15.792,LET THEM SEE THE COST OF DARING TO CHALLENGE THE GOD-KING.
01:08:17.625,01:08:23.583,KING LEONIDAS AND HIS BRAVE 300 WERE THE FINEST GREECE HAS TO OFFER.
01:08:23.625,01:08:28.083,THERE WILL BE NO SAVIORS TO RISE UP AND VANQUISH US.
01:08:28.125,01:08:31.792,NOTHING WILL STOP THE MARCH OF MY EMPIRE.
01:08:31.834,01:08:35.959,YOUR MAJESTY.
01:08:37.917,01:08:41.750,"YOU, TAKE THIS DEAD KING'S SWORD TO ATHENS."
01:08:41.792,01:08:45.000,LET THEM KNOW THAT I AM COMING NEXT FOR THEM.
01:08:45.041,01:08:47.792,LET THEM KNOW...
01:08:47.834,01:08:49.250,ATHENS...
01:08:49.291,01:08:53.250,THEIR PRIZE JEWEL OF A CITY...
01:08:53.291,01:08:57.583,WILL DISAPPEAR FROM THE HISTORIES.
01:08:59.375,01:09:01.834,THEMISTOKLES!
01:09:03.750,01:09:05.583,I BRING WORD FROM THERMOPYLAE.
01:09:05.625,01:09:08.000,LEONIDAS WAS BETRAYED BY A HUNCHBACK.
01:09:08.041,01:09:10.333,THE SPARTANS HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED.
01:09:10.375,01:09:11.792,THE HOT GATES HAVE FALLEN.
01:09:14.166,01:09:16.208,SUCH A SACRIFICE.
01:09:19.875,01:09:23.250,NOW GREECE HAS HER MARTYRS.
01:09:23.291,01:09:30.959,"DAXOS, TAKE THAT MESSAGE FROM THE HOT GATES TO EVERY CITY, EVERY VILLAGE."
01:09:31.000,01:09:33.583,LET EVERY COUNTRYMAN HEAR YOUR WORDS.
01:09:33.625,01:09:35.834,BUT THEY ARE DEAD.
01:09:35.875,01:09:38.834,SPARTA'S SACRIFICE WILL BE WHAT UNITES US.
01:09:38.875,01:09:40.166,"NOW, GO."
01:09:40.208,01:09:41.875,HYAH!
01:09:41.917,01:09:45.625,MOVE ALL OF OUR SHIPS AND MEN BACK TO THE SAFETY OF SALAMIS.
01:09:45.667,01:09:47.875,AND YOU?
01:09:47.917,01:09:50.667,I WILL TAKE DAXOS' MESSAGE TO ATHENS.
01:09:50.709,01:09:54.709,I WAS TOLD A HUNCHBACK WAS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FALL OF THE HOT GATES.
01:09:54.750,01:10:02.750,"THAT HE SOLD OUT HIS COUNTRY, PULLED THE CRIMSON FROM HIS BACK AND REPLACED IT WITH PERSIAN GOLD."
01:10:02.792,01:10:07.291,WHAT IS YOUR NAME...
01:10:07.333,01:10:08.667,TRAITOR?
01:10:08.709,01:10:10.959,EPHIALTES OF TRACHIS.
01:10:23.291,01:10:28.083,I SHOULD WET THIS NOBLE BLADE WITH YOUR BLOOD.
01:10:28.125,01:10:31.000,YOU WOULD BE RIGHT TO DO SO.
01:10:31.041,01:10:34.542,THERE IS LITTLE BEAUTY ABOUT ME.
01:10:34.583,01:10:37.667,THERE IS LITTLE BEAUTY IN WHAT I HAVE DONE.
01:10:41.750,01:10:45.250,SAY WHAT YOU MUST.
01:10:45.291,01:10:47.417,I BEG OF YOU...
01:10:47.458,01:10:49.875,AND ALL OF ATHENS!
01:10:49.917,01:10:52.125,THE GOD-KING WILL BURN THIS CITY TO THE GROUND!
01:10:52.166,01:10:53.583,Man: WHAT'S GOING ON?
01:10:53.625,01:10:54.959,Man #2: WHAT DOES HE MEAN?
01:10:55.000,01:10:57.959,QUIET YOURSELVES!
01:10:58.000,01:11:02.125,LEONIDAS AND SPARTA'S GREAT SACRIFICE WAS NO DEFEAT.
01:11:04.208,01:11:08.041,IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL VICTORY.
01:11:08.083,01:11:17.834,THIS SIMPLE ACT OF VALOR WILL ALLOW US TO RALLY EACH OF OUR CITY-STATES AND UNITE GREECE...
01:11:17.875,01:11:20.709,FOR ONE PURPOSE...
01:11:20.750,01:11:22.500,AGAINST ONE ENEMY!
01:11:22.542,01:11:24.542,AND YOU.
01:11:24.583,01:11:28.458,YOU TAKE THIS MESSAGE TO YOUR GOD-KING.
01:11:28.500,01:11:34.208,THAT WE WILL TAKE WHATEVER SHIPS WE HAVE LEFT AND FINISH THIS IN THE BAY OF SALAMIS.
01:11:34.250,01:11:37.750,BUT THERE WILL BE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION.
01:11:37.792,01:11:41.417,"YES, THERE WILL BE."
01:11:47.625,01:11:51.208,THEMISTOKLES.
01:11:51.250,01:11:54.083,I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO YOUR QUEEN.
01:11:54.125,01:11:56.333,"A WARNING, ATHENIAN."
01:11:56.375,01:11:59.083,YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE A WARM WELCOME.
01:12:25.625,01:12:29.125,MAY I OFFER MY DEEPEST SYMPATHIES.
01:12:29.166,01:12:36.500,"I CANNOT CHANGE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO LEONIDAS, BUT HIS SACRIFICE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN."
01:12:36.542,01:12:41.041,"DO NOT LECTURE ME ON SACRIFICE AND BE QUICK WITH YOUR WORDS, ATHENIAN."
01:12:43.458,01:12:46.583,I REQUEST OF YOU THE ENTIRE SPARTAN NAVY.
01:12:46.625,01:12:49.542,"EVERY MAN, EVERY SHIP THAT YOU CAN SPARE."
01:12:49.583,01:12:53.709,HAVE I NOT GIVEN ENOUGH FOR YOUR DREAM OF A UNITED GREECE?
01:12:53.750,01:12:56.583,SHALL I PUT SWORDS IN THE HANDS OF MY SON?
01:12:56.625,01:12:59.250,OUR CHILDREN?
01:12:59.291,01:13:04.208,"HAVE I NOT GIVEN ENOUGH FOR YOUR AMBITIONS, THEMISTOKLES?"
01:13:04.250,01:13:05.959,A KING.
01:13:06.000,01:13:09.208,"HUSBANDS, FATHERS, BROTHERS."
01:13:09.250,01:13:13.083,SPARTA WILL GIVE NO MORE.
01:13:26.458,01:13:29.709,THIS BELONGS WITH YOU.
01:13:37.875,01:13:40.959,AVENGE HIM.
01:13:57.709,01:14:02.291,Queen Gorgo: THE ORACLE'S WORDS STOOD AS A WARNING.
01:14:02.333,01:14:04.458,ALL OF GREECE WILL FALL...
01:14:04.500,01:14:08.291,AS PERSIAN FIRE REDUCES ATHENS TO CINDER.
01:14:08.333,01:14:14.417,FOR ATHENS IS A PILE OF STONE AND WOOD AND CLOTH AND DUST.
01:14:14.458,01:14:18.834,"AND AS DUST, WILL VANISH INTO THE WIND."
01:14:18.875,01:14:22.333,ONLY THE ATHENIANS THEMSELVES EXIST.
01:14:22.375,01:14:27.375,AND THE FATE OF THE WORLD HANGS ON THEIR EVERY SYLLABLE.
01:14:27.417,01:14:29.750,ONLY THE ATHENIANS EXIST.
01:14:29.792,01:14:33.750,AND ONLY STOUT WOODEN SHIPS CAN SAVE THEM.
01:14:33.792,01:14:36.125,WOODEN SHIPS...
01:14:36.166,01:14:39.750,AND A TIDAL WAVE OF HEROES' BLOOD.
01:14:46.291,01:14:50.291,Xerxes: THE GREEKS WERE FOOLS TO STAND AGAINST US.
01:14:50.333,01:14:54.959,LEONIDAS AND HIS PRIDE WERE NO MATCH FOR THE WILL OF A GOD.
01:14:57.000,01:15:00.458,THEMISTOKLES WAS A WORTHLESS COWARD.
01:15:02.458,01:15:07.250,THIS PATHETIC NAVY IS BARELY WORTH OUR ATTENTION.
01:15:07.291,01:15:12.792,"IF THAT WORTHLESS COWARD HAD STOOD AT MY SIDE, WE WOULD HAVE LAID THE WORLD AT YOUR FEET."
01:15:12.834,01:15:15.000,Ephialtes: MY KING.
01:15:15.041,01:15:20.834,YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT BRINGS YOU NEWS.
01:15:20.875,01:15:26.250,THE GREEK FLEET ARE DEFENSELESS WITHIN THE BAY OF SALAMIS.
01:15:26.291,01:15:29.667,YOU NEED ONLY FINISH THEM.
01:15:29.709,01:15:31.500,WHO COMMANDS THEIR FORCES?
01:15:34.166,01:15:37.542,THEMISTOKLES OF ATHENS.
01:15:37.583,01:15:39.250,THEMISTOKLES IS DEAD.
01:15:39.291,01:15:42.750,HE IS ALIVE.
01:15:56.041,01:15:59.500,READY MY TROOPS AND ARMOR.
01:15:59.542,01:16:01.000,WE WILL ATTACK AT ONCE.
01:16:01.041,01:16:03.667,WISDOM...
01:16:03.709,01:16:07.583,WOULD HAVE US SEND A PROBING FORCE TO CONFIRM IT IS NOT A TRAP.
01:16:07.625,01:16:11.000,YOU WOULD DARE TO ADVISE ME IN MATTERS OF WAR?
01:16:12.500,01:16:14.333,I AM THE GOD-KING.
01:16:14.375,01:16:17.542,I AM THE ONE WHO TRIUMPHED OVER LEONIDAS.
01:16:17.583,01:16:21.875,I AM THE ONE WHO LAID WASTE TO THIS SHOWPIECE OF ATHENS.
01:16:21.917,01:16:23.542,I AM YOUR KING.
01:16:23.583,01:16:27.542,KILLING LEONIDAS AND HIS MEN ONLY MADE THEM MARTYRS.
01:16:27.583,01:16:35.125,"AND WHEN YOU RAZED ATHENS, YOU SET FIRE TO THE ONLY THING OF VALUE IN THIS COUNTRY."
01:16:46.041,01:16:49.500,I WILL ATTACK THE GREEKS...
01:16:49.542,01:16:52.542,WITH MY ENTIRE NAVY.
01:16:54.291,01:16:55.583,ARTEMISIA.
01:16:55.625,01:16:57.458,ENOUGH!
01:16:57.500,01:17:02.000,DO NOT FORGET WHO PUT THE CROWN ON YOUR CHILDISH HEAD.
01:17:02.041,01:17:04.208,MY KING.
01:17:04.250,01:17:09.709,NOW SIT ON YOUR GOLDEN THRONE AND WATCH THIS BATTLE FROM THE SAFETY I PROVIDE YOU.
01:17:15.083,01:17:17.875,"THERE, IN THE DISTANCE..."
01:17:17.917,01:17:21.083,WE WITNESS THE DESTRUCTION OF ATHENS.
01:17:24.125,01:17:29.542,"ALONE, WE WILL FACE THE MONSTER THAT CASTS THE SHADOW ACROSS OUR LAND."
01:17:31.375,01:17:35.667,I HAD PRAYED THAT THE SPARTANS WOULD COME TO LEND A HAND THIS MORNING.
01:17:37.917,01:17:40.750,PERHAPS THEY FEEL THEY HAVE GIVEN ENOUGH.
01:17:40.792,01:17:42.625,Man: YOU FAILED US ALL.
01:17:42.667,01:17:44.208,"THIS IS YOUR FAULT, THEMISTOKLES."
01:17:44.250,01:17:46.041,"WITHOUT SPARTANS, WE'RE JUST FARMHANDS."
01:17:46.083,01:17:48.333,WE SHOULD'VE NEGOTIATED WITH THE PERSIANS WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE.
01:17:52.250,01:17:55.875,YOU ARE ALL RIGHT.
01:17:55.917,01:18:00.500,"YES, WE ARE DOWN TO A HANDFUL OF BOATS."
01:18:00.542,01:18:05.083,"AND, YES, WE ARE JUST FARMHANDS."
01:18:05.125,01:18:07.542,WE ARE TRADESMEN.
01:18:07.583,01:18:09.750,WE ARE BOYS...
01:18:09.792,01:18:14.959,TURNED TO MEN THROUGH THE SACRIFICE AND FORGE OF COMBAT.
01:18:15.000,01:18:19.125,I PLAYED A DANGEROUS GAME...
01:18:19.166,01:18:21.417,AND I LOST!
01:18:25.000,01:18:30.792,"IF YOU CHOOSE TO TURN YOUR BACK ON ME, ON YOUR COUNTRY..."
01:18:34.000,01:18:37.083,...I WILL NOT JUDGE YOU.
01:18:37.125,01:18:39.750,YOU ARE FREE TO LEAVE.
01:18:39.792,01:18:42.500,YOU ARE STILL FREE MEN.
01:19:05.208,01:19:08.250,VERY WELL.
01:19:08.291,01:19:14.834,THEN LET US PUT OUR SHOULDERS TO WORK AND FREE THOSE SHIPS FROM THE BOSOM OF GREECE.
01:19:14.875,01:19:19.583,TODAY IS A PRIVILEGE TO CALL OUR OWN.
01:19:19.625,01:19:24.291,A STORY THAT WILL BE TOLD FOR A THOUSAND YEARS.
01:19:24.333,01:19:30.125,LET OUR FINAL STAND BE RECORDED TO THE HISTORIES.
01:19:30.166,01:19:37.750,AND LET IT BE SHOWN THAT WE CHOSE TO DIE ON OUR FEET RATHER THAN LIVE ON OUR KNEES!
01:20:24.792,01:20:28.166,THERE IS ONLY ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY.
01:20:28.208,01:20:29.583,NOT TO GET KILLED.
01:20:29.625,01:20:31.166,NO.
01:20:31.208,01:20:33.834,YOUR FATHER'S LAST WORDS.
01:20:37.792,01:20:42.667,HE TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD EARNED THE RIGHT TO SIT AT THE TABLE.
01:20:57.291,01:21:03.625,"WELL, MY BROTHER, I HAVE NO MORE TACTICS OR TRICKS."
01:21:03.667,01:21:05.959,THIS WILL BE THE LAST BATTLE THAT WE SHARE.
01:21:06.000,01:21:09.667,WE HAVE FOUGHT NEXT TO ONE ANOTHER FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER.
01:21:11.417,01:21:14.959,NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME MORE THAN TO REST THIS SWORD.
01:21:15.000,01:21:17.917,THE PREPARATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED?
01:21:17.959,01:21:19.709,BELOW DECK.
01:21:19.750,01:21:21.458,GOOD.
01:21:21.500,01:21:24.542,ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU WANT TO COMMIT EVERYTHING?
01:21:24.583,01:21:26.542,YES.
01:21:26.583,01:21:31.291,"WITHOUT ARTEMISIA'S COMMAND, THE PERSIAN NAVY IS NOTHING."
01:21:31.333,01:21:34.417,WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO REACH HER.
01:21:34.458,01:21:37.208,I WILL REACH HER...
01:21:37.250,01:21:40.375,AND PUT AN END TO THIS.
01:21:40.417,01:21:43.250,THERE WILL BE NO ROOM FOR A RETREAT.
01:21:43.291,01:21:45.834,I KNOW.
01:21:45.875,01:21:51.417,"Artemisia: TODAY, THE LAST GREEK SHIPS WILL BE DESTROYED."
01:21:51.458,01:21:53.834,SHOW THEM NO MERCY.
01:21:53.875,01:21:56.709,GIVE THEM NO QUARTER.
01:21:56.750,01:22:00.166,TODAY WE WILL DANCE ACROSS THE BACKS OF DEAD GREEKS.
01:22:00.208,01:22:04.333,TODAY WE DELIVER SUBMISSION.
01:22:04.375,01:22:08.834,TODAY I WANT TO FEEL THEMISTOKLES' THROAT BENEATH MY BOOTS.
01:22:38.917,01:22:42.041,MEN!
01:23:36.083,01:23:39.333,PREPARE FOR CLOSE QUARTERS.
01:23:45.250,01:23:48.000,YOUR FATHER WATCHES YOU!
01:23:48.041,01:23:50.417,HOLD NOTHING BACK!
01:23:50.458,01:23:51.917,SEIZE YOUR GLORY!
01:24:00.834,01:24:01.834,AAH!
01:24:20.166,01:24:22.917,I'M NOT HERE AS A WITNESS!
01:25:24.125,01:25:25.583,NOW!
01:25:25.625,01:25:28.875,AND LET THEM SEND OUR SOULS STRAIGHT TO HELL!
01:26:05.166,01:26:08.917,HYAH! COME ON!
01:27:15.750,01:27:18.750,YOU OFFERED FREEDOM WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE OR RESPONSIBILITY.
01:27:18.792,01:27:20.667,ARE YOU ACCEPTING MY OFFER?
01:27:20.709,01:27:22.333,MY ANSWER IS STILL NO.
01:27:37.333,01:27:38.333,AAH!
01:27:50.375,01:27:53.375,YOU FIGHT MUCH HARDER THAN YOU FUCK.
01:28:35.375,01:28:37.208,SURRENDER TO ME.
01:28:37.250,01:28:39.375,OR MEET YOUR DEATH.
01:28:39.417,01:28:42.417,WHO WOULD YOU FIGHT IF NOT FOR ME?
01:28:42.458,01:28:45.291,NO ONE COULD CHALLENGE YOUR SKILL.
01:28:45.333,01:28:48.917,I WOULD RATHER DIE A FREE MAN THAN AS A SLAVE.
01:28:48.959,01:28:52.083,EVEN IF THE CHAIN WAS ATTACHED TO YOU.
01:29:00.125,01:29:03.792,Queen Gorgo: IT BEGINS AS A WHISPER.
01:29:03.834,01:29:06.875,A PROMISE.
01:29:06.917,01:29:13.333,THE LIGHTEST OF BREEZES DANCES THROUGH THE RIGGING AS IT CREAKS ABOVE THE DEATH CRIES OF TEN THOUSAND MEN.
01:29:13.375,01:29:18.542,IT MOVES THROUGH HER HAIR AS GENTLY AS A LOVER'S HAND.
01:29:18.583,01:29:22.709,"THAT BREEZE, THAT PROMISE, BECAME A WIND."
01:29:22.750,01:29:35.542,A WIND THAT IS BLOWN ACROSS GREECE CARRYING A MESSAGE TOLD AGAIN AND AGAIN OF OUR LADY FREEDOM AND HOW WISE SHE WAS TO CHARGE LEONIDAS TO LAY ALL AT HER FEET.
01:29:35.583,01:29:40.041,"A WIND, MY BROTHERS, OF SACRIFICE."
01:29:40.083,01:29:44.166,A WIND OF FREEDOM.
01:29:44.208,01:29:48.959,A WIND OF JUSTICE.
01:29:54.583,01:29:57.667,A WIND OF VENGEANCE.
01:30:41.458,01:30:42.834,YOU ARE BEING SURROUNDED.
01:30:42.875,01:30:46.291,ALL OF GREECE HAS UNITED AGAINST YOU.
01:30:46.333,01:30:52.834,"DELPHI, THEBES, OLYMPIA, ARCADIA, AND SPARTA."
01:31:06.208,01:31:09.750,"IF DEATH COMES FOR ME TODAY, I'M READY."
01:31:09.792,01:31:13.083,I COULD LOWER MY SWORD.
01:31:13.125,01:31:15.959,THERE'S STILL TIME FOR YOU TO READY A LAUNCH AND ESCAPE.
01:31:19.500,01:31:23.834,IT WOULD BE A POOR CHOICE TO FORCE MY HAND INTO ACTION.
01:31:23.875,01:31:29.583,NOW ORDER YOUR SHIPS TO DISENGAGE AND SURRENDER TO ME.
01:31:29.625,01:31:32.125,SURRENDER?
