00:01:48.316,00:01:51.444,"Quick, honey, take my picture. I got the pyramid in my hand."
00:02:00.745,00:02:02.872,"Justin, you get back here right now!"
00:02:03.248,00:02:04.290,"No, stop!"
00:02:11.589,00:02:12.590,"Wait, wait."
00:02:12.715,00:02:14.759,"Hold on. Easy, little boy."
00:02:16.094,00:02:18.346,"Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!"
00:02:19.639,00:02:22.600,"No, no, no! Oh! There he goes."
00:02:34.154,00:02:35.321,Justin!
00:02:43.997,00:02:45.790,I've got him! I've got him!
00:02:56.759,00:03:04.976,Outrage in Egypt tonight as it was discovered that the Great Pyramid of Giza had been stolen and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.
00:03:05.184,00:03:11.357,There is panic throughout the globe as countries and citizens try to protect their beloved landmarks.
00:03:11.858,00:03:19.449,"Law enforcement still has no leads, leaving everyone to wonder, which of the world's villains is responsible for this heinous crime?"
00:03:19.741,00:03:21.576,And where will he strike next?
00:04:10.458,00:05:04.262,"I'm having a bad, bad day It's about time that I get my way Steamrolling whatever I see I'm having a bad, bad day If you take it personal, that's okay Watch, this is so fun to see Despicable me Hello, Fred."
00:05:04.345,00:05:10.852,"FYI, your dog has been leaving little bombs all over my yard, and I don't appreciate it."
00:05:15.481,00:05:17.191,Unless they're dead.
00:05:19.777,00:05:20.945,I'm joking!
00:05:22.030,00:05:24.949,"Although, it is true. Anyway, have a good one."
00:05:25.825,00:05:28.453,"Oh, okay. Uh... Yeah."
00:05:29.620,00:06:02.737,"Steamrolling whatever I see I'm having a bad, bad day If you take it personal, that's okay Despicable me Cookies for sale."
00:06:04.864,00:06:07.075,Go away. I'm not home.
00:06:07.492,00:06:09.911,"Yes, you are. I heard you."
00:06:13.915,00:06:15.833,...is a recording.
00:06:18.586,00:06:22.840,"Watch this. Leave a message, beep."
00:06:26.594,00:06:28.429,"Goodbye, recorded message."
00:06:32.767,00:06:33.851,Huh?
00:06:42.235,00:06:46.197,"Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin."
00:06:46.280,00:06:47.406,Gru!
00:06:48.074,00:06:50.034,"Ah, Dr. Nefario."
00:06:50.201,00:06:51.786,I know how you must be feeling.
00:06:51.869,00:06:59.836,"I, too, have encountered great disappointment, but in my eyes, you will always be one of the greats."
00:07:00.503,00:07:01.963,What? What happened?
00:07:02.046,00:07:03.464,It's all over the news!
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.550,Some fella just stole a pyramid.
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.886,They're saying he makes all other villains look...
00:07:09.720,00:07:11.222,Lame.
00:07:13.558,00:07:15.601,Assemble the minions!
00:07:46.257,00:07:48.092,"Minions, assemble!"
00:07:49.135,00:07:50.595,Okay. Okay.
00:07:52.638,00:07:53.681,Throo...
00:07:57.643,00:07:58.769,Hey!
00:08:46.192,00:08:48.861,"Looking good, Kevin! How is the family? Good?"
00:08:48.945,00:08:50.154,All right.
00:08:50.238,00:08:53.241,"That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?"
00:08:54.283,00:08:56.327,"Hello, everybody!"
00:08:56.410,00:08:58.287,"Yeah, all right!"
00:08:58.371,00:09:00.706,Simmer down. Simmer down!
00:09:00.790,00:09:02.667,"Thank you, okay."
00:09:02.750,00:09:08.506,"Now, I realize that you guys probably heard about this other villain who stole the pyramids."
00:09:08.589,00:09:10.925,"Apparently, it's a big deal."
00:09:11.008,00:09:14.428,People are calling it the crime of the century and stuff like that.
00:09:14.512,00:09:18.683,"But am I upset? No, I am not!"
00:09:20.184,00:09:28.484,"A little, but we have had a pretty good year ourselves, and you guys are all right in my book."
00:09:29.735,00:09:30.945,"No, no raises!"
00:09:31.028,00:09:34.198,You're not going to get any raises.
00:09:35.032,00:09:36.659,What did we do?
00:09:36.742,00:09:42.748,"Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!"
00:09:44.584,00:09:46.085,Huh?
00:09:46.168,00:09:48.212,That's how I roll.
00:09:48.588,00:09:52.258,"Yeah, you all like watching football on that, huh?"
00:09:53.092,00:09:54.510,But that's not all.
00:09:54.594,00:10:01.934,"We stole the Statue of Liberty, the small one from Las Vegas."
00:10:04.103,00:10:08.107,And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas.
00:10:08.232,00:10:15.781,"Okay, I wasn't going to tell you about this yet, but I have been working on something very big!"
00:10:16.657,00:10:20.995,Something that will blow this pyramid thing out of the water!
00:10:21.662,00:10:26.042,And thanks to the efforts of my good friend Dr. Nefario...
00:10:26.417,00:10:27.460,Thank you!
00:10:29.337,00:10:30.796,He's styling.
00:10:31.422,00:10:47.021,"Now, we have located a shrink ray in a secret lab, and once we take this shrink ray, we will have the capability to pull off the true crime of the century."
00:10:47.772,00:10:50.816,We are going to steal...
00:10:52.777,00:10:57.156,"Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet."
00:11:00.534,00:11:01.577,Hey.
00:11:01.661,00:11:03.788,"Dave, listen up, please."
00:11:08.417,00:11:16.967,"Next, we are going to steal, the moon!"
00:11:18.427,00:11:27.061,"And once the moon is mine, the world will give me whatever I want to get it back!"
00:11:27.144,00:11:32.483,And I will be the greatest villain of all time!
00:11:35.486,00:11:39.365,That's what I'm talking about.
00:11:41.325,00:11:42.410,Yes?
00:11:42.493,00:11:49.500,"Hello, Gru? I've been crunching some numbers, and I really don't see how we can afford this."
00:11:49.583,00:11:52.378,It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.
00:11:52.837,00:11:54.463,"Hey, chillax."
00:11:54.547,00:11:58.175,I'll just get another loan from the bank. They love me!
00:12:13.858,00:12:15.568,"Edith, stop it!"
00:12:15.651,00:12:17.736,What? I'm just walking.
00:12:35.504,00:12:37.006,"Hello, girls!"
00:12:37.089,00:12:39.925,Anybody come to adopt us while we were out?
00:12:40.050,00:12:42.845,Mmm. Let me think.
00:12:43.345,00:12:44.430,No!
00:12:47.641,00:12:50.811,Edith! What did you put on my desk?
00:12:51.145,00:12:52.813,A mud pie.
00:12:57.568,00:12:59.862,"-Yeah, I know. -Good."
00:13:00.196,00:13:03.532,"So, how did it go, girls? Did we meet our quotas?"
00:13:04.116,00:13:05.701,"Mmm, sort of."
00:13:05.784,00:13:10.039,"We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies, and 18 coco-nutties."
00:13:14.502,00:13:18.380,"Well, you say that like it's a great sale day."
00:13:18.464,00:13:20.633,Look at my face!
00:13:20.716,00:13:23.969,Do you still think it's a great sale day?
00:13:24.887,00:13:26.889,Eighteen coco-nutties.
00:13:27.306,00:13:31.977,"I think we can do a little better than that, don't you?"
00:13:32.811,00:13:33.854,Yeah.
00:13:33.979,00:13:38.317,"We wouldn't want to spend the weekend in the Box of Shame, would we? No."
00:13:39.985,00:13:43.697,"Okay, good. Off you go. Go clean something of mine."
00:13:45.741,00:13:46.992,"-Hi, Penny. -Hi, Penny."
00:13:53.207,00:13:56.418,"Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but..."
00:13:56.752,00:14:00.047,I just wanted to congratulate you on stealing the pyramid.
00:14:07.513,00:14:13.102,"Just so you know, Mom, I am about to do something that's very, very big, very important."
00:14:13.519,00:14:16.272,"When you hear about it, you're going to be very proud."
00:14:17.773,00:14:21.026,"Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here."
00:15:29.386,00:15:31.430,Gru to see Mr. Perkins.
00:15:31.889,00:15:33.933,"Yes, please have a seat."
00:15:50.824,00:15:52.576,one giant leap for mankind.
00:15:52.660,00:15:55.412,"Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon."
00:15:58.749,00:16:01.168,NASA isn't sending the monkeys anymore.
00:16:09.927,00:16:10.970,Hey.
00:16:18.435,00:16:22.606,I'm applying for a new villain loan. Go by the name of Vector.
00:16:27.194,00:16:33.283,"It's a mathematical term, a quantity represented by an arrow, with both direction and magnitude."
00:16:37.287,00:16:44.628,"Vector! That's me, 'cause I'm committing crimes with both direction and magnitude."
00:16:44.712,00:16:46.380,"Oh, yeah!"
00:16:48.507,00:16:50.134,Check out my new weapon.
00:16:50.217,00:16:52.469,"Piranha gun! Oh, yes!"
00:16:52.553,00:16:56.306,"Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before? No, you haven't. I invented it."
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.559,Do you want a demonstration?
00:16:59.018,00:17:11.655,"Oh! Shoot! So difficult, sometimes, is money from the bank to build a rocket."
00:17:11.739,00:17:14.700,"-And then, the moon is ours. -Wow!"
00:17:15.576,00:17:17.453,"Well, very nice presentation."
00:17:17.536,00:17:19.830,I'd like to see this shrink ray.
00:17:19.913,00:17:22.666,Absolutely! Will do.
00:17:25.085,00:17:27.046,You don't have it?
00:17:27.171,00:17:30.632,And yet you have the audacity to ask the bank for money?
00:17:31.884,00:17:33.385,Apparently.
00:17:33.510,00:17:37.848,"Do you have any idea of the capital that this bank has invested in you, Gru?"
00:17:38.891,00:17:44.063,With far too few of your sinister plots actually turning a profit.
00:17:44.354,00:17:48.358,How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.
00:17:48.609,00:17:51.111,If we don't start getting our money back...
00:17:53.072,00:17:54.615,Get the picture?
00:17:56.200,00:18:05.000,"Look, Gru, the point is, there are a lot of new villains out there, younger than you, hungrier than you, younger than you."
00:18:05.084,00:18:07.377,Like that young fellow out there named Vector.
00:18:07.461,00:18:08.879,He just stole a pyramid!
00:18:13.592,00:18:15.719,I've got it. I've got it.
00:18:16.095,00:18:19.681,"Um... So, as far as getting money for the rocket..."
00:18:19.765,00:18:22.768,"Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk."
00:19:58.864,00:20:00.199,Suckers!
00:20:07.164,00:20:08.415,Ah-ha! We got it!
00:20:16.715,00:20:19.509,Hey! Hey! What! Hey!
00:20:21.220,00:20:22.221,"No, no, no!"
00:20:25.766,00:20:26.934,You!
00:20:29.895,00:20:33.690,"Now, maybe you'll think twice before you freeze someone's head!"
00:20:33.774,00:20:35.567,"So long, Gru!"
00:20:37.277,00:20:38.904,Quick! We can't let him get away!
00:20:49.957,00:20:51.541,"Fire! Fire, now!"
00:21:00.592,00:21:01.593,"Oops, you missed me!"
00:21:16.942,00:21:18.277,Take that.
00:21:25.325,00:21:27.619,Like taking candy from a...
00:21:27.911,00:21:28.954,What?
00:21:29.830,00:21:31.957,"Ha! Hey, Gru!"
00:21:32.082,00:21:35.168,Try this on for size!
00:21:36.628,00:21:39.339,That's weird. What is going...
00:21:44.428,00:21:46.305,This is claustrophobic!
00:21:47.723,00:21:49.141,"No, no, no!"
00:21:54.980,00:21:57.399,Too small! This is too small for me!
00:22:03.780,00:22:05.490,I hate that guy!
00:22:12.331,00:22:16.335,"...and please watch over us, and bless that we'll have a good night's sleep."
00:22:16.460,00:22:22.841,"And bless that while we're sleeping, no bugs will crawl into our ears and lay eggs in our brains."
00:22:23.175,00:22:25.844,"Great. Thanks for that image, Edith."
00:22:26.094,00:22:34.186,"And please bless that someone will adopt us soon, and that the mommy and daddy will be nice and have a pet unicorn."
00:22:34.644,00:22:35.854,Amen.
00:22:35.937,00:22:37.689,-Amen. -Amen.
00:22:45.947,00:24:53.825,"Uni, uni, unicorns I love them Uni, unicorns, I could pet one And they are So, I bought one so I could pet it Now it loves me Now I love it La, la, la, la, la Oh, good luck, little girls!"
00:24:58.997,00:25:01.166,Whoa! Cool.
00:25:02.292,00:25:06.338,Hi! We're orphans from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.
00:25:08.465,00:25:11.676,"We're selling cookies so, you know, we can have a better future."
00:25:13.511,00:25:14.638,Yeah.
00:25:36.785,00:25:38.870,Light bulb.
00:25:43.375,00:25:46.628,I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots disguised as cookies!
00:25:46.711,00:25:48.713,-What? -Cookie robots!
00:25:48.797,00:25:50.966,"-Who is this? -Oh, forget it."
00:25:57.847,00:26:02.894,"Well, it appears you have cleared our background check, Dr. Gru."
00:26:05.689,00:26:12.195,Oh! And I see you have made a list of some of your personal achievements.
00:26:12.529,00:26:15.073,Thank you for that. I love reading.
00:26:22.872,00:26:27.544,And I see you have been given the Medal of Honor and a knighthood.
00:26:29.921,00:26:31.339,"-Me, me, me. -Me, me, me."
00:26:31.423,00:26:32.507,Kevin?
00:26:34.426,00:26:40.598,You had your own cooking show and you can hold your breath for 30 seconds?
00:26:40.682,00:26:42.267,It's not that impressive.
00:26:52.610,00:26:54.946,What in the name of... What?
00:26:56.197,00:26:59.367,"Well, here's the dealio."
00:26:59.451,00:27:08.793,"Things have been so lonely since my wife, Debbie, passed on."
00:27:08.877,00:27:17.469,"It's like my heart is a tooth, and it's got a cavity that can only be filled with children."
00:27:17.927,00:27:19.095,I'm sorry.
00:27:23.475,00:27:26.644,You are a beautiful woman. Do you speak Spanish?
00:27:27.145,00:27:29.564,Do I look like I speak Spanish?
00:27:31.399,00:27:34.944,You have a face como un burro.
00:27:37.238,00:27:38.365,Oh!
00:27:42.452,00:27:46.164,"Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?"
00:27:46.247,00:27:47.832,"So, so excited!"
00:27:49.751,00:27:53.129,"Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes to come to the lobby."
00:27:56.174,00:27:57.884,I bet the mom is beautiful!
00:27:57.967,00:28:00.095,I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.
00:28:00.178,00:28:02.972,I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.
00:28:03.973,00:28:06.267,I'm just saying it'd be nice.
00:28:06.643,00:28:10.647,Aw! My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.
00:28:10.730,00:28:12.232,That's a Cheeto.
00:28:12.315,00:28:13.483,Oh!
00:28:15.485,00:28:18.988,"Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman."

00:28:24.786,00:28:26.287,"Oh! Hi, girls!"
00:28:36.339,00:28:39.134,"Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Gru."

00:29:04.659,00:29:06.995,-Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it. -Higher!
00:29:09.664,00:29:12.834,How do you remove them? Is there a command?
00:29:12.917,00:29:14.878,Some nonstick spray?
00:29:19.841,00:29:22.510,"Okay, girls, let's go."
00:29:46.367,00:29:47.786,"Oh, yeah!"

00:30:08.431,00:30:10.433,"I got the shrink ray, all right."
00:30:11.643,00:30:14.145,"No, I'm not playing with it."
00:30:17.524,00:30:19.359,Don't make me laugh! No.
00:30:19.859,00:30:27.158,"P.S., he is not getting the moon, and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him, he's gonna be begging for mercy."
00:30:29.244,00:30:30.453,"Okay, bye."
00:30:32.455,00:30:36.543,"Look at you, a little tiny toilet for a little tiny baby..."
00:30:37.961,00:30:39.796,"Curse you, tiny toilet!"
00:30:44.467,00:30:46.553,"Okay, here we are."
00:30:46.636,00:30:48.179,Home sweet home.
00:30:50.640,00:30:53.560,"So, this is, like, your house?"
00:30:54.352,00:30:55.645,Wait a sec...
00:30:55.728,00:30:58.481,You're the guy who pretended he was a recorded message!
00:30:58.565,00:31:00.567,"No, that was someone else."
00:31:14.122,00:31:15.415,Can I hold your hand?
00:31:16.207,00:31:17.250,"Uh, no."
00:31:27.510,00:31:32.390,"When we got adopted by a bald guy, I thought this'd be more like Annie."
00:31:41.316,00:31:42.609,"No, hey!"
00:31:46.696,00:31:49.866,"Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests."
00:31:49.949,00:31:52.577,"Girls, this is Kyle, my..."
00:31:52.660,00:31:53.703,Dog.
00:31:56.289,00:31:57.665,Ooh! Fluffy doggy!
00:32:03.046,00:32:04.213,What kind of dog is that?
00:32:04.297,00:32:06.925,He is a... I don't know.
00:32:11.512,00:32:13.181,'Cause it's not.
00:32:14.223,00:32:16.601,No! No! Stay away from there!
00:32:16.684,00:32:18.227,It's fragile.
00:32:20.855,00:32:24.275,"Well, I suppose the plan will work with two."
00:32:30.156,00:32:32.241,It poked a hole in my juice box.
00:32:37.330,00:32:42.168,"As you can see, I have provided everything a child might need."
00:32:44.045,00:32:45.129,All right.
00:32:49.842,00:32:50.885,Somebody broke that.
00:32:51.344,00:32:55.014,"Okay, okay. Clearly, we need to set some rules."
00:32:55.098,00:32:56.933,Rule number one.
00:32:57.016,00:32:59.602,You will not touch anything.
00:32:59.686,00:33:01.521,Uh-huh. What about the floor?
00:33:01.938,00:33:03.982,"Yes, you may touch the floor."
00:33:04.065,00:33:05.441,What about the air?
00:33:05.525,00:33:07.610,"Yes, you may touch the air!"
00:33:07.694,00:33:08.736,What about this?
00:33:11.906,00:33:13.866,-Where did you get that? -Found it.
00:33:13.950,00:33:17.745,Okay. Rule number two. You will not bother me while I'm working.
00:33:17.829,00:33:19.706,Rule number three.
00:33:19.789,00:33:26.963,You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle or sneeze or burp or fart!
00:33:27.630,00:33:31.968,"So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?"
00:33:32.051,00:33:33.928,Does this count as annoying?
00:33:37.640,00:33:38.850,Very!
00:33:41.310,00:33:43.896,I will see you in six hours.
00:33:45.982,00:33:49.902,"Okay, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine."
00:33:50.528,00:33:54.907,We're gonna be really happy here. Right? Agnes?
00:34:22.810,00:34:26.606,"Uh, question. What are these?"
00:34:31.944,00:34:33.988,Look at this. Watch me!
00:34:37.867,00:34:40.536,Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.
00:34:41.120,00:34:43.706,Why are you so old?
00:34:46.167,00:34:47.794,Okay. I'm on it.
00:35:05.728,00:35:06.979,TV!
00:35:31.504,00:35:32.797,Come on!
00:35:33.297,00:35:35.591,I don't think he's a dentist.
00:35:49.438,00:35:51.274,We've been working on this for a while.
00:35:51.357,00:35:54.110,It's a anti-gravity serum.
00:35:59.824,00:36:03.244,"I meant to close that. He'll be all right, I'm sure."
00:36:03.327,00:36:08.457,"-Do the effects wear off? -Uh, so far, no. No, they don't."
00:36:10.001,00:36:13.087,"And here, of course, is the new weapon you ordered."
00:36:16.757,00:36:17.800,"No, no."
00:36:17.884,00:36:21.721,"I said dart gun, not... Okay."
00:36:22.305,00:36:27.768,"Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering under what circumstances would we use this?"
00:36:27.852,00:36:29.312,"But, anyway."
00:36:29.395,00:36:32.815,What I really wanted to show you was this.
00:36:37.570,00:36:40.698,Now those are cookie robots!
00:36:45.161,00:36:48.831,What are you doing here? I told you to stay in the kitchen!
00:36:48.915,00:36:51.500,We got bored. What is this place?
00:36:51.751,00:36:53.419,Can I drink this?
00:36:53.502,00:36:55.796,Do you want to explode?
00:36:57.590,00:36:58.633,Gru!
00:36:58.716,00:37:00.676,Get back in the kitchen!
00:37:00.760,00:37:02.887,-Will you play with us? -No.
00:37:03.304,00:37:05.514,-Why? -Because I'm busy.
00:37:07.266,00:37:08.517,Um...
00:37:08.601,00:37:10.186,"Okay, okay, you got me."
00:37:10.269,00:37:13.022,The dentist thing is more of a hobby.
00:37:13.606,00:37:16.025,"In real life, I am a spy."
00:37:16.525,00:37:21.864,"And it is top secret, and you may not tell anybody, -because if you do... -What does this do?"
00:37:25.743,00:37:27.245,-Hey! -Oops.
00:37:27.703,00:37:29.163,My unicorn!
00:37:29.497,00:37:31.165,You have to fix it.
00:37:31.249,00:37:36.545,"Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated. By definition, it cannot be fixed."
00:37:41.842,00:37:44.011,That's freaking me out. What is she doing?
00:37:44.095,00:37:47.265,She's gonna hold her breath until she gets a new one.
00:37:48.641,00:37:50.893,It is just a toy. Now stop it!
00:37:54.313,00:37:56.440,"Okay, okay! I'll fix it!"
00:37:56.857,00:37:58.818,Tim! Mark! Phil!
00:38:01.487,00:38:02.738,This is very important.
00:38:02.822,00:38:06.284,You have to get the little girl a new unicorn toy.
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.451,Eh?
00:38:12.373,00:38:14.250,"Hey, hey, hey! A toy!"
00:38:15.418,00:38:17.545,"Go, and hurry!"
00:38:17.628,00:38:18.796,What are those?
00:38:18.879,00:38:22.049,They are my cousins.
00:38:22.883,00:38:24.427,Jerry! Stuart!
00:38:25.511,00:38:28.514,"Watch them, and keep them away from me, please."
00:39:10.348,00:39:11.474,Ooh!
00:39:24.445,00:39:25.529,Oh!
00:39:25.613,00:39:26.739,Hmm...
00:39:53.182,00:39:54.350,It was your cousin's idea.
00:39:54.683,00:39:55.851,What?
00:39:56.227,00:39:57.728,"Okay, bedtime."
00:39:59.563,00:40:00.731,-Aw! -Aw!
00:40:01.023,00:40:02.483,Not you two!
00:40:04.026,00:40:08.739,Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye. All tucked in. Sweet dreams.
00:40:10.658,00:40:14.370,"Just so you know, you're never gonna be my dad."
00:40:14.453,00:40:17.206,Hmm. I think I can live with that.
00:40:18.874,00:40:20.709,Are these beds made out of bombs?
00:40:21.252,00:40:25.423,"Yes, but they are very old and highly unlikely to blow up."
00:40:26.340,00:40:28.384,But try not to toss and turn.
00:40:28.467,00:40:29.593,Cool.
00:40:30.553,00:40:33.722,-Will you read us a bedtime story? -No.
00:40:33.806,00:40:36.892,But we can't go to sleep without a bedtime story.
00:40:36.976,00:40:40.563,"Well, then it's going to be a long night for you, isn't it?"
00:40:41.397,00:40:45.025,"So, good night, sleep tight, and don't let the bed bugs bite."
00:40:45.109,00:40:48.988,Because there are literally thousands of them.
00:40:54.785,00:40:56.787,"He's just kidding, Agnes."
00:41:19.185,00:41:21.103,It's beautiful.
00:41:49.507,00:41:51.967,"Girls, let's go."
00:41:52.051,00:41:54.887,Time to deliver the cookies!
00:41:54.970,00:41:58.516,"Mmm. Okay. But first, we're going to dance class."
00:41:58.599,00:42:01.519,"Actually, we're going to have to skip the dance class today."
00:42:01.602,00:42:08.234,"Actually, we can't We have a big recital coming up."
00:42:08.317,00:42:11.570,"-We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake. -Yeah, Swan Lake!"

00:42:43.936,00:42:45.688,Walking to dance class.
00:42:45.771,00:42:47.731,"Ya? Okay, fine."
00:42:47.815,00:42:51.694,"You just keep walking, because I'm really not driving you!"
00:42:54.446,00:42:56.949,You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!
00:42:57.408,00:42:59.451,"Seriously, I'm going to count to three!"

00:43:28.480,00:43:31.692,"Oh, yes. My pinkie promises."
00:43:44.872,00:43:49.585,All right. Our first customer is a man named Vector.
00:43:49.668,00:43:51.420,But he's a V.
00:43:51.503,00:43:53.464,"You know, we're supposed to start with the A's."
00:43:53.547,00:43:55.466,Then we go to the B's. Then we...

00:44:03.140,00:44:09.605,I was just thinking that it might be nice to deliver Mr. Vector's first.
00:44:09.688,00:44:11.315,That is all.
00:44:14.568,00:44:17.154,Almost over. It's almost over.

00:50:24.730,00:50:27.023,"He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!"
00:50:27.107,00:50:28.567,You've gotta let us play for it!
00:50:28.692,00:50:30.360,"No, no, no."
00:50:30.444,00:50:31.737,Come on!
00:50:33.280,00:50:35.824,How much for the fluffy unicorn?
00:50:37.033,00:50:38.952,"Well, it is not for sale."
00:50:39.035,00:50:44.040,But all you gotta do to win it is knock down that little spaceship there.
00:50:44.875,00:50:46.042,It's easy!
00:50:54.384,00:50:55.719,Yay!
00:51:07.647,00:51:08.899,Again!
00:51:09.566,00:51:12.027,-Wait! -Come on. One more time!
00:51:12.110,00:51:13.278,Just one more.
00:51:13.403,00:51:15.739,I accidentally closed my eyes.
00:51:37.511,00:51:40.430,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?"
00:51:41.139,00:51:44.226,She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.
00:51:44.309,00:51:47.062,"Hey, buddy, let me explain something to you."
00:51:47.145,00:51:51.691,You see that little tin spaceship? You see how it's not knocked over?
00:51:51.775,00:51:54.611,"Do you know what that means, professor?"
00:51:54.694,00:51:58.240,It means you don't get the unicorn!
00:51:58.323,00:52:00.283,Oh! Uh-oh!
00:52:00.367,00:52:02.244,Somebody's got a frowny face.
00:52:02.327,00:52:04.788,Boo! Better luck next time!
00:52:06.957,00:52:09.668,"Okay, my turn."
00:52:31.147,00:52:33.650,Knocked over!
00:52:37.988,00:52:40.866,-It's so fluffy! -Yeah!
00:52:41.491,00:52:43.618,That was awesome!
00:52:43.702,00:52:45.328,You blew up the whole thing!
00:52:45.412,00:52:47.831,Let's go. Let's try another game!
00:52:54.838,00:52:57.257,"Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?"
00:52:58.008,00:53:00.260,"Okay, girls, go play."
00:53:07.851,00:53:10.103,I got the shrink ray!
00:53:12.731,00:53:14.941,Cotton candy!
00:53:15.942,00:53:19.905,We have 12 days until the moon is in optimum position.
00:53:20.030,00:53:22.115,We can't afford any distractions!
00:53:23.867,00:53:25.118,Get me Perkins.
00:53:31.291,00:53:32.542,Ah-ha!
00:53:33.209,00:53:39.382,"Sorry to bother you, Mr. Perkins, but I figured that you would want to see this!"
00:53:40.133,00:53:41.259,What?
00:53:56.399,00:53:59.402,"Now, the rest of the plan is simple."
00:53:59.986,00:54:03.740,I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.
00:54:03.823,00:54:07.535,I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.
00:54:09.329,00:54:11.456,Sorry. Sorry!
00:54:11.581,00:54:14.668,Could you excuse me for just one second?
00:54:14.751,00:54:16.169,I told you not to touch my things.
00:54:16.252,00:54:19.255,"I told you, I told you. I've told you a thousand times."
00:54:19.339,00:54:21.049,"Hey, can we order pizza?"
00:54:21.132,00:54:23.051,Pizza? You just had lunch.
00:54:23.134,00:54:24.302,"Not now, for dinner."
00:54:24.427,00:54:25.929,Dinner?
00:54:26.012,00:54:28.848,"Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever. Just get back in there!"
00:54:28.932,00:54:30.767,Oh! Can we get stuffed crust?
00:54:31.977,00:54:33.228,-Stuffed crust! -Stuffed crust!
00:54:33.311,00:54:34.896,I'll stuff you all in the crust!
00:54:36.940,00:54:38.274,You're funny!
00:54:38.358,00:54:41.111,Just don't come out of that room again!
00:54:41.653,00:54:42.696,All right.
00:54:43.613,00:54:47.033,Sorry about that. Where were we?
00:54:47.117,00:54:48.702,You were sitting on the toilet.
00:54:48.785,00:54:53.331,"No, no, no! No, I'm sorry. It was a little attempt at humor."
00:54:53.456,00:54:56.209,I know how much you like to laugh...
00:54:58.670,00:55:02.507,"...inside. Now, I was saying..."
00:55:06.136,00:55:08.054,"You don't seem terribly focused, Gru."
00:55:08.138,00:55:10.515,"Believe me, I am completely focused."
00:55:10.640,00:55:12.600,-Hello! Whoa! -What?
00:55:12.684,00:55:13.852,That guy is huge!
00:55:13.977,00:55:15.353,-Are we on TV? -What are those? Children?
00:55:15.478,00:55:18.231,What are you doing? I told you to stay out of here!
00:55:23.486,00:55:24.696,"No, no, no!"
00:55:24.821,00:55:25.822,Freeze ray!
00:55:25.947,00:55:27.532,Mr. Gru?
00:55:32.287,00:55:33.621,Okay.
00:55:34.998,00:55:36.332,As I was saying...
00:55:36.458,00:55:40.295,No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.
00:55:40.378,00:55:42.756,-But my plan... -Is a great plan.
00:55:42.839,00:55:46.009,"I love everything about your plan, except for one thing."
00:55:46.843,00:55:48.178,You.
00:55:51.473,00:55:55.018,"Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me landing on the moon!"
00:55:58.146,00:56:02.192,"Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket out of macaroni!"
00:56:04.819,00:56:09.199,"Look, Mom, I made a real rocket based on the macaroni prototype!"
00:56:20.418,00:56:22.212,I don't understand.
00:56:22.545,00:56:24.798,"Let's face reality, Gru."
00:56:24.881,00:56:29.677,You've been at this for far too long with far too little success.
00:56:29.886,00:56:34.057,"We're gonna put our faith, our money, into a..."
00:56:34.891,00:56:36.518,"Well, a younger villain."
00:56:36.601,00:56:38.103,But I...
00:56:38.228,00:56:40.271,"It's over. Goodbye, Gru."
00:57:01.543,00:57:09.425,"Now, I know there have been some rumors going around that the bank is no longer funding us."
00:57:10.260,00:57:13.096,"Well, I am here to put those rumors to rest."
00:57:15.223,00:57:17.142,They are true.
00:57:19.102,00:57:24.607,"In terms of money, we have no money."
00:57:24.732,00:57:27.277,So how will we get to the moon?
00:57:28.445,00:57:30.280,The answer is clear.
00:57:30.405,00:57:31.948,We won't.
00:57:34.993,00:57:37.287,We are doomed.
00:57:38.580,00:57:43.168,Now would probably be a good time to look for other employment options.
00:57:45.086,00:57:46.171,I know.
00:57:46.296,00:57:51.468,"I have fired up my resume as I suggest that all of you do, as well."
00:57:52.469,00:57:54.095,What is it?
00:57:55.972,00:57:59.309,Can't you see that I am in the middle of a pep talk?
00:58:28.963,00:58:30.298,Yes!
00:58:30.381,00:58:37.514,"Yes, we will build our own rocket using this and whatever else we can find!"
00:58:37.972,00:58:41.559,Grab everything! Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
00:58:42.060,00:58:43.937,Who needs the bank?
00:58:44.020,00:58:45.813,Let's go. Let's go!
00:59:38.116,00:59:40.952,And here he is in the bathtub.
00:59:41.119,00:59:43.371,Oh! Look at his little buns.
00:59:45.707,00:59:47.166,Mom.
00:59:47.250,00:59:48.626,Not cool.
00:59:49.627,00:59:54.215,"And here, he's all dressed up in his Sunday best."
00:59:54.882,00:59:56.509,He looks like a girl!
01:00:23.119,01:00:24.746,You're funny!
01:00:38.259,01:00:41.179,Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!
01:01:01.949,01:01:03.785,Send him in.
01:01:04.952,01:01:06.621,"Hey, Dad."
01:01:07.455,01:01:08.915,You wanted to see me?
01:01:08.998,01:01:11.918,"-Yes, I did, Victor. -I am not Victor anymore."
01:01:12.001,01:01:15.505,Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!
01:01:15.588,01:01:16.923,Sit down!
01:01:18.508,01:01:20.968,Do you know where the shrink ray is?
01:01:21.344,01:01:23.346,Duh! Back at my place.
01:01:23.429,01:01:26.265,"Oh, is that right? Back at your place? Oh, that's cool."
01:01:26.349,01:01:30.645,I guess Gru must just have one that looks exactly like it!
01:01:32.647,01:01:36.484,Oh! What the... Those girls sold me cookies!
01:01:36.776,01:01:40.530,Do you have any idea how lucrative this moon heist could be?
01:01:40.613,01:01:44.158,"I give you the opportunity of a lifetime, and you just blow it!"
01:01:45.201,01:01:48.496,"-No, I didn't. -Oh, really?"
01:01:48.871,01:01:51.791,You just wait until Gru sees my latest weapon.
01:01:51.874,01:01:54.877,"Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!"
01:02:01.551,01:02:02.802,Don't worry.
01:02:02.885,01:02:06.180,The moon is as good as ours.
01:02:09.016,01:02:10.476,"Come on now, it's bedtime."
01:02:10.560,01:02:13.229,Did you brush your teeth? Let me smell. Let me smell.
01:02:14.397,01:02:15.732,You did not!
01:02:15.857,01:02:19.902,"Put on your PJs. Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!"
01:02:20.027,01:02:24.490,"This is beddie-bye time, right now. I'm not kidding around. I mean it!"
01:02:24.574,01:02:27.326,"-But we're not tired! -Well, I am tired."
01:02:27.410,01:02:29.662,Will you read us a bedtime story?
01:02:33.541,01:02:34.917,No.
01:02:35.001,01:02:36.252,Pretty please!
01:02:36.335,01:02:40.173,The physical appearance of the please makes no difference.
01:02:40.256,01:02:42.341,"It is still no, so go to sleep."
01:02:42.425,01:02:44.510,But we can't. We're all hyper!
01:02:44.594,01:02:49.098,"And without a bedtime story, we'll just keep getting up and bugging you."
01:02:49.223,01:02:50.266,All night long.
01:02:54.771,01:02:57.774,"All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens."
01:02:58.232,01:02:59.567,Sleepy Kittens?
01:03:01.861,01:03:04.113,You use them when you tell the story.
01:03:11.245,01:03:13.790,"Okay, let's get this over with."
01:03:14.290,01:03:18.544,"Three little kittens loved to play, they had fun in the sun all day."
01:03:18.628,01:03:26.969,"Then their mother came out and said, 'Time for kittens to go to bed.' Wow! This is garbage. You actually like this?"
01:03:27.094,01:03:28.387,Keep reading!
01:03:29.597,01:03:31.557,"-Come on! -All right, all right, all right."
01:03:31.808,01:03:45.446,"Three little kittens started to bawl, 'Mommy, we're not tired at all.' Their mother smiled and said with a purr, 'Fine, but at least you should brush your fur.' Now you brush the fur."
01:03:47.156,01:03:48.908,This is literature?
01:03:48.991,01:03:52.245,A 2-year-old could have written this. All right.
01:03:52.787,01:04:07.844,"Three little kittens with fur all brushed said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed!' Their mother replied, with a voice like silk, 'Fine, but at least you should drink your milk.' Now make them drink the milk."
01:04:11.889,01:04:16.102,"Oh, I don't like this book. This is going on forever."
01:04:16.185,01:04:22.525,"Three little kittens, with milk all gone, rubbed their eyes and started to yawn."
01:04:28.865,01:04:34.704,"'We can't sleep, we can't even try.' Then their mother sang a lullaby."
01:04:34.787,01:04:40.543,"'Good night kittens, close your eyes. Sleep in peace until you rise."
01:04:41.127,01:04:55.516,"'Though while you sleep, we are apart, 'your mommy loves you with all her heart.' The end. Okay, good night."
01:04:56.517,01:04:58.728,-Wait! -What?
01:04:58.853,01:05:00.563,What about good night kisses?
01:05:02.690,01:05:06.402,"No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging or kissing."
01:05:09.363,01:05:11.908,"He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes."
01:05:12.575,01:05:14.577,I like him. He's nice.
01:05:14.702,01:05:16.037,But scary.
01:05:17.246,01:05:18.581,Like Santa!
01:05:37.099,01:05:41.270,"Only 48 hours till the launch, and all systems are go."
01:05:42.563,01:05:49.946,"Uh... About that, I was thinking that maybe we could move the date of the heist."
01:05:50.071,01:05:55.618,"Please tell me this is not as a result of the girls' dance recital, is it?"
01:05:55.743,01:05:57.954,"No, no, no!"
01:05:58.037,01:06:01.082,The recital? Don't... That's stupid!
01:06:01.207,01:06:06.045,I just think it's kind of weird to do it on a Saturday.
01:06:06.128,01:06:11.759,"I was thinking, maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?"
01:06:12.468,01:06:16.055,"Gru, you and I have been working on this for years."
01:06:16.138,01:06:18.224,It's everything we've dreamed of.
01:06:18.307,01:06:23.562,"Your chance to make history, become the man who stole the moon!"
01:06:23.646,01:06:27.358,But these girls are becoming a major distraction!
01:06:27.441,01:06:28.776,They need to go.
01:06:29.610,01:06:33.614,"If you don't do something about it, then I will."
01:06:35.282,01:06:36.951,I understand.
01:06:39.453,01:06:40.955,Good.
01:06:44.083,01:06:45.251,Butt.
01:06:48.462,01:06:49.672,Butt.
01:07:02.226,01:07:03.394,Butt.
01:07:09.108,01:07:11.777,we will make the clink sound with our mouths.
01:07:11.861,01:07:13.029,Ready? Edith?
01:07:13.112,01:07:14.155,-Clink. -Clink.
01:07:14.238,01:07:16.240,There we go. And now we drink.
01:07:16.991,01:07:18.034,And Agnes?
01:07:18.117,01:07:19.201,-Clink. -Clink.
01:07:22.246,01:07:23.372,"Excuse me, girls."
01:07:25.332,01:07:28.753,"Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking."
01:07:31.505,01:07:32.757,Oh!
01:07:32.840,01:07:34.717,"Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?"
01:07:34.800,01:07:38.721,I'm here for the girls. I received a call that you wanted to return them.
01:07:41.307,01:07:45.561,"And also, I did purchase a Spanish dictionary."
01:07:48.981,01:07:50.191,I didn't like what you said.
01:07:55.654,01:07:56.781,Oh!
01:07:57.948,01:08:00.534,I will get the girls ready.
01:08:10.419,01:08:12.880,"Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru!"
01:08:14.131,01:08:16.008,Tell her you wanna keep us.
01:08:16.092,01:08:18.094,"All right, girls. Come on, let's go."
01:08:18.177,01:08:20.679,"Goodbye, Mr. Gru. Thanks for everything."
01:08:36.779,01:08:38.864,I did it for your own good.
01:08:39.240,01:08:42.326,"Come on, let's go get that moon."
01:08:44.161,01:08:45.246,Right.
01:10:01.822,01:10:02.948,What is this for?
01:10:04.617,01:10:05.910,The recital?
01:10:05.993,01:10:09.246,I am the greatest criminal mind of the century.
01:10:09.330,01:10:13.417,I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!
01:10:34.230,01:10:39.193,Opening launch bay doors. Commencing launch sequence.
01:10:39.276,01:10:44.281,And we are good to go in T minus 10 seconds.
01:10:45.366,01:10:50.955,"Ten, nine, eight, seven, six..."
01:11:20.234,01:11:22.778,"Nice work, Doctor. All systems go."
01:11:23.195,01:11:24.280,Boo-ya!
01:11:35.541,01:11:37.126,My flight suit.
01:11:38.877,01:11:42.047,"Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty..."
01:13:05.172,01:13:06.799,Ah-ha!
01:13:06.882,01:13:08.592,I've got it!
01:13:10.094,01:13:12.930,I've got the moon!
01:13:13.013,01:13:15.808,I've got the moon!
01:13:30.906,01:13:32.408,I can make it!
01:13:39.665,01:13:42.000,-Wait a minute! -Kevin!
01:13:45.129,01:13:46.713,"Come on, come on!"
01:13:54.972,01:13:56.557,He's still not here.
01:13:56.640,01:13:59.059,Why would he come? He gave us up.
01:13:59.143,01:14:00.686,But he pinkie promised!
01:14:00.769,01:14:03.522,"Girls, girls, places!"
01:14:03.605,01:14:06.400,"No, we can't start yet! We're still expecting someone."
01:14:06.483,01:14:08.861,Can we just wait a few more minutes?
01:14:12.698,01:14:15.117,All right. But just a few more minutes.
01:14:15.200,01:14:17.286,"He's not coming, guys."
01:14:20.747,01:14:22.749,"Gru! Gru, can you hear me?"
01:15:05.709,01:15:08.420,That's Third Street. The dance studio...
01:15:08.504,01:15:09.922,There! There! There it is!
01:15:47.376,01:15:49.795,"Sorry, buddy. Show's over."
01:15:50.128,01:15:51.755,Over?
01:16:29.710,01:16:31.211,"Vector, open up!"
01:16:32.963,01:16:35.465,First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.
01:16:51.607,01:16:53.108,"Now, the girls."
01:16:53.191,01:16:57.571,"Actually, I think I'll hold on to them a little while longer."
01:16:57.654,01:16:58.697,No!
01:16:58.780,01:17:01.450,"Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!"
01:17:02.159,01:17:03.660,"Listen close, you little punk."
01:17:03.744,01:17:07.039,"When I get in there, you are in for a world of pain!"
01:17:08.332,01:17:10.167,I'm really scared!
01:17:13.629,01:17:15.464,He is gonna kick your butt.
01:18:24.366,01:18:25.534,Ha! There he is!
01:18:38.046,01:18:39.339,"Oh, no!"
01:18:42.676,01:18:43.719,Ow?
01:18:49.599,01:18:51.435,Vector has the girls. Go!
01:18:55.439,01:18:57.107,What happened to the ship? It's big again!
01:18:57.232,01:18:59.943,-Not as big as the moon is going to be! -What?
01:19:00.068,01:19:05.115,"The larger the mass of an object, the quicker the effects of the shrink ray wear off!"
01:19:05.240,01:19:08.118,I call it the Nefario Principle.
01:19:08.243,01:19:09.995,"I just came up with it now, actually."
01:19:10.912,01:19:12.164,"Oh, no!"
01:19:18.462,01:19:19.796,Did you see that?
01:19:19.921,01:19:22.632,-Vector! Help! -Vector!
01:19:22.758,01:19:23.925,-Over here! -Hey!
01:19:24.050,01:19:25.635,What are you girls doing back there?
01:19:25.761,01:19:26.762,The moon!
01:19:40.650,01:19:41.777,Ouch!
01:19:50.452,01:19:51.745,You got it.
01:20:15.310,01:20:17.229,Are you insane?
01:20:17.312,01:20:18.730,"Don't worry, I will catch you."
01:20:19.648,01:20:21.066,You gave us back!
01:20:21.149,01:20:25.320,"I know, I know. And it is the worst mistake I ever made."
01:20:25.904,01:20:27.823,But you have to jump now.
01:20:28.406,01:20:30.492,It'll be okay.
01:20:35.455,01:20:36.498,"Okay, girls."
01:20:38.583,01:20:40.085,Jump now!
01:20:45.090,01:20:47.342,"Margo, I will catch you."
01:20:48.009,01:20:51.096,And I will never let you go again.
01:21:00.689,01:21:02.691,-Not so fast! -No!
01:21:08.029,01:21:09.114,Margo!
01:21:14.870,01:21:17.122,"I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!"
01:21:46.067,01:21:47.569,I got you.
01:22:05.712,01:22:06.838,No!
01:22:23.855,01:22:25.106,"Oh, poop."
01:22:26.358,01:22:31.571,"This time, good triumphs, and the moon has been returned to its rightful place in the sky."
01:22:31.780,01:22:38.286,"But once again, law enforcement is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder, who is this mysterious hero?"
01:22:38.370,01:22:40.330,And what will he do next?
01:22:40.872,01:22:42.666,"Okay, girls. Time for bed."
01:22:42.749,01:22:46.461,-Come on! We want a story. -Three sleepy kittens!
01:22:46.544,01:22:50.799,"Oh, no! Sorry. That book was accidentally destroyed maliciously."
01:22:52.217,01:22:55.428,Tonight we are going to read a new book.
01:22:55.512,01:23:01.476,This one is called One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?
01:23:01.559,01:23:05.981,"Oh! Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!"
01:23:06.773,01:23:08.483,"Here, watch this."
01:23:09.651,01:23:11.069,That's the horn!
01:23:15.490,01:23:17.575,This is gonna be the best book ever!
01:23:17.659,01:23:22.455,"Not to pat myself on the back, but, yes, it probably will be."
01:23:22.539,01:23:23.623,Here we go.
01:23:23.707,01:23:29.504,"One big unicorn, strong and free thought he was happy as he could be."
01:23:30.839,01:23:38.388,Then three little kittens came around and turned his whole life upside down.
01:23:38.471,01:23:40.223,"Hey, that one looks like me!"
01:23:40.306,01:23:42.434,"No, what are you talking about? These are kittens!"
01:23:42.517,01:23:46.271,Any relation to persons living or dead is completely coincidental.
01:23:56.740,01:23:59.200,He never should have said goodbye.
01:24:00.035,01:24:10.712,And now he knows he could never part from those three little kittens that changed his heart.
01:24:10.795,01:24:12.881,The end.
01:24:12.964,01:24:15.300,"Okay, all right. Good night."
01:24:40.784,01:24:42.494,"I love you, too."
01:24:51.836,01:24:53.671,"No, no!"
01:24:55.882,01:24:57.008,All right.
01:25:02.013,01:25:03.515,Didn't I get you already?
01:25:38.007,01:25:40.009,They're very good!
01:25:40.093,01:25:43.054,"I'm so proud of you, Son."
01:25:43.138,01:25:46.057,You've turned out to be a great parent!
01:25:47.183,01:25:48.685,Just like me.
01:25:49.269,01:25:51.521,Maybe even better.
01:26:18.840,01:26:20.550,"No, I'm fine. Go ahead."
01:26:22.302,01:26:23.761,"No, no, no!"
01:28:03.444,01:28:04.988,"Hey, Carl! Hey."
01:28:05.113,01:28:06.114,Hmm?
01:28:09.284,01:28:10.326,"No, no, no."
01:28:12.954,01:28:13.997,John?
01:28:14.122,01:28:15.123,"No, no. Me, me, me."
01:30:31.759,01:30:33.136,"Hello, I am Gru."
01:30:33.261,01:30:36.264,"Back to work, back to work! Back to..."
