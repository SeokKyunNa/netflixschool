00:39:23.027,00:39:25.238,"Secure this area and block all exits, now."
00:39:25.405,00:39:27.031,Go!
01:00:33.130,01:00:34.840,"-Do you want dessert? -No, thank you."
01:00:35.340,01:00:37.008,I'd like one.
01:00:37.300,01:00:39.928,This is a game that rewards patience and balance.
01:00:40.095,01:00:43.640,You must think like a man of action and act like a man of thought.
01:02:18.235,01:02:21.988,"Cassian, what does one do when there's no way out of a situation?"
01:02:22.364,01:02:24.282,If there's no way out...
01:02:25.450,01:02:28.828,...the best thing is to find a way further in.
01:50:39.216,01:50:41.885,With compliments of Enzo and Mario Calvini.
01:50:57.025,01:50:58.527,Thank you.
00:01:11.696,00:01:15.116,"MAN: Listen, I'm from the Bronx, so you need to keep it simple."
00:01:15.283,00:01:19.496,Why is the bank buying all this missile-guidance stuff from Calvini?
00:01:21.331,00:01:22.582,I don't get it.
00:01:53.196,00:01:54.864,The window will stay closed.
00:01:58.368,00:01:59.702,You need to relax.
00:02:00.245,00:02:03.081,I'm more comfortable tense.
00:02:04.249,00:02:06.042,"You came to us, remember?"
00:02:06.209,00:02:08.711,You wanted a way out and I'm offering you one.
00:02:08.878,00:02:11.673,I only met you 30 minutes ago...
00:02:11.840,00:02:16.386,...and now you expect me just to walk away from everything I know...
00:02:16.636,00:02:18.721,...put my life in your hands.
00:02:20.348,00:02:23.852,"You want a little more time to think things through, I get it..."
00:02:24.018,00:02:26.146,...but we're gonna need another meet...
00:02:27.063,00:02:29.232,...and I'm gonna need to see some paper.
00:02:31.651,00:02:34.863,Yes. Now get out of the car.
00:02:57.427,00:02:58.428,-Hey. -Ella?
00:02:58.595,00:03:00.680,"-You done? -Yeah, I just met with him."
00:03:00.847,00:03:02.932,"-And? -Oh, he's real."
00:03:03.099,00:03:05.602,He's real enough to blow this thing wide open.
00:03:05.768,00:03:08.521,He told me the bank's buying $200 million worth...
00:03:08.688,00:03:10.189,...of missile-guidance systems.
00:03:10.356,00:03:12.775,-What do they need those for? -I don't know.
00:03:12.942,00:03:14.402,You gonna see him a second time?
00:03:14.569,00:03:18.781,"Yeah, yeah. Listen, we're gonna meet again. He's agreed to bring me paper."
00:03:18.948,00:03:20.783,"Right, I'll call you later."
00:03:21.159,00:03:22.994,"Thanks, Elle."
00:03:46.476,00:03:47.810,Hey.
00:04:15.004,00:04:18.549,DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any blurred or double vision?
00:04:19.217,00:04:21.010,LOUIS: No.
00:04:22.095,00:04:23.137,Nothing.
00:04:23.304,00:04:24.931,"Just follow the light, please."
00:04:30.812,00:04:34.315,It's been noted that you were experiencing ringing in your ears.
00:04:34.482,00:04:35.525,Yes.
00:04:35.692,00:04:38.945,I would like to keep you here overnight for observation.
00:04:39.112,00:04:41.197,That won't be necessary.
00:04:44.867,00:04:46.744,Where's my colleague?
00:04:50.873,00:04:52.041,Thomas Schumer.
00:05:04.721,00:05:06.556,It was definitely a heart attack?
00:05:08.599,00:05:11.519,Acute myocardial infarction. Yes.
00:05:25.950,00:05:28.077,"Your penlight, can I use it?"
00:05:41.257,00:05:42.258,What are you doing?
00:05:42.842,00:05:44.552,Can you help me turn him over?
00:05:44.719,00:05:47.597,-I'm afraid I can't allow you to-- -Just help me.
00:06:07.241,00:06:10.703,We need to contact the Berlin police and request an immediate autopsy.
00:06:10.870,00:06:12.288,Why?
00:06:12.705,00:06:15.750,Because I don't think this man died of natural causes.
00:06:16.417,00:06:17.794,"MAN: Come on, Ella."
00:06:17.960,00:06:20.880,If Schumer met this insider in Berlin...
00:06:21.047,00:06:23.800,...odds are this guy's a foreign national. So it's federal.
00:06:23.966,00:06:26.344,But you're not listening to me. Let them meet again.
00:06:26.511,00:06:29.013,The guy's gonna bring paper and Tommy will close him.
00:06:29.180,00:06:33.142,You still have to coordinate with Justice if you want witness protection.
00:06:33.309,00:06:36.104,I just tried both their cells again. Straight to voice mail.
00:06:36.270,00:06:37.480,Ugh. Shit.
00:06:37.647,00:06:40.983,I'm gonna try Tommy's wife at work. If I have to bring DOJ into this...
00:06:41.150,00:06:44.070,...they're gonna do what they've always done with this.
00:06:44.237,00:06:47.156,"They're gonna stall us with red tape, informant's gonna bolt..."
00:06:47.323,00:06:49.742,"...and I'm telling you, he could be the bombshell..."
00:06:49.909,00:06:52.495,...we've spent the last two years looking for.
00:06:53.162,00:06:54.372,Voice mail.
00:06:55.915,00:06:58.584,What's going on? Why aren't they calling us back?
00:06:58.751,00:07:01.671,What do you want me to do? I can't afford another turf war.
00:07:01.838,00:07:05.842,-It's Salinger. -Finally. Put him on speaker.
00:07:07.969,00:07:11.431,"Jesus, Lou. What took you guys so long?"
00:07:13.015,00:07:15.476,Hello? You there?
00:07:17.311,00:07:19.272,"ELEANOR: So, what's up?"
00:07:20.606,00:07:22.650,Tommy's dead.
00:07:24.277,00:07:25.528,What?
00:07:29.323,00:07:31.033,"He's dead, Ella."
00:07:31.200,00:07:33.953,I need you to get over here as soon as you can.
00:07:35.913,00:07:39.417,"LOUIS: Unnaturally red blood, lambent membranes."
00:07:39.584,00:07:42.003,Two key indicators of hydrocyanic poisoning.
00:07:42.211,00:07:43.588,This lesion on the neck...
00:07:43.754,00:07:47.425,"...is how the poison was introduced into the bloodstream, percutaneously."
00:07:47.592,00:07:49.677,The lesion tested negative for any poison.
00:07:49.844,00:07:53.347,There are any number of reasons for this discoloration of the blood...
00:07:53.514,00:07:57.727,"...least likely of which is hydrocyanic-- I'm telling you, he was murdered."
00:08:04.525,00:08:07.528,"Well, I'm assuming you suspect a combination..."
00:08:07.695,00:08:09.739,...of prussic acid and DMSO...
00:08:10.573,00:08:13.159,...but then the reaction time would have been immediate.
00:08:13.326,00:08:15.161,Within one minute.
00:08:15.328,00:08:18.122,Which means the killer would have had to deliver the toxin...
00:08:18.289,00:08:20.583,...after Schumer exited the car.
00:08:26.380,00:08:29.592,So did you see anything unusual?
00:08:29.759,00:08:32.345,Anybody approaching Schumer?
00:08:35.348,00:08:37.600,No. I mean....
00:08:39.936,00:08:41.729,I don't know.
00:08:42.104,00:08:45.441,What is it that makes you so certain he was assassinated?
00:08:52.448,00:08:55.618,Agent Salinger and I have reason to believe this might be connected...
00:08:55.785,00:08:57.954,...to an ongoing investigation being conducted...
00:08:58.120,00:09:01.457,...by both my team at the Manhattan DA's office and Interpol.
00:09:01.874,00:09:04.293,-What investigation? -I run a group at Interpol...
00:09:04.460,00:09:07.964,...that focuses on financial operations associated with organized crime.
00:09:08.464,00:09:11.509,"About two years ago, we began receiving correlated intelligence..."
00:09:11.676,00:09:15.304,...regarding the illicit activities of a bank based out of Luxembourg...
00:09:15.471,00:09:17.807,...the International Bank of Business and Credit.
00:09:17.974,00:09:20.851,"Under the direction of its chairman, Jonas Skarssen..."
00:09:21.018,00:09:23.980,...we believe the IBBC has quietly become the bank of choice...
00:09:24.146,00:09:31.070,"...for monies associated with organized crime, capital flight-- How is any of this related to Schumer and the New York DA's office?"
00:09:31.237,00:09:32.655,The IBBC's Manhattan branch...
00:09:32.822,00:09:35.825,...is the epicenter of its U.S. money-laundering operation.
00:09:35.992,00:09:38.494,Schumer and I were working this case together.
00:09:38.661,00:09:41.330,Agent Salinger and his department have been assisting us.
00:09:41.497,00:09:44.917,Why weren't we informed of these details prior to this briefing?
00:10:05.479,00:10:07.857,What was Schumer doing here in Berlin?
00:10:08.190,00:10:10.818,I set him up on a blind date with an IBBC executive...
00:10:10.985,00:10:14.030,...who was aware of our investigation and looking to make a deal.
00:10:14.196,00:10:16.365,And the identity of this informant?
00:10:16.532,00:10:20.119,We don't know. He took precautions to keep his identity anonymous.
00:10:20.578,00:10:23.205,"For the past 12 hours, I've been trying hard to find him."
00:10:23.372,00:10:26.542,"I believe that if this man isn't already dead, he soon will be."
00:10:26.917,00:10:28.127,Why?
00:10:28.544,00:10:30.880,"Because, just like Schumer..."
00:10:31.213,00:10:33.883,...anyone that's in a position to move against this bank...
00:10:34.050,00:10:36.052,...has either ended up dead or disappeared.
00:10:36.844,00:10:41.015,"Agent Salinger, given your history with this matter..."
00:10:41.182,00:10:43.392,...I should think you would be more careful...
00:10:43.559,00:10:46.020,...before making such extreme accusations.
00:10:46.187,00:10:48.439,My history? What are you talking about?
00:10:48.606,00:10:50.650,We've reviewed your dossier.
00:10:51.484,00:10:53.152,Have you?
00:10:54.445,00:10:57.073,"Well, that means you know just about shit."
00:11:00.034,00:11:05.247,"I realize this is a trying time for you both, but until I'm provided..."
00:11:05.414,00:11:08.668,...with something more compelling than unsubstantiated theories...
00:11:09.418,00:11:13.798,...pursuing the IBBC is simply not going to happen here in Germany.
00:11:21.722,00:11:24.225,"Concorde Hotel, please."
00:11:29.688,00:11:33.192,What was that back there? What history was Diemer talking about?
00:11:33.359,00:11:35.111,-Don't worry. -Don't give me that shit.
00:11:35.277,00:11:38.072,-What do they know that I don't? -They don't know anything.
00:11:38.239,00:11:39.698,Enough to get a rise out of you.
00:11:39.865,00:11:43.577,"I'm not getting into it. You're so curious, read my file."
00:11:47.873,00:11:50.918,I should never have let Tommy walk into this.
00:11:51.627,00:11:53.462,You didn't. I approved the meet.
00:11:53.629,00:11:56.132,"I was across the fucking street, Ella."
00:11:57.967,00:12:00.136,I was right there.
00:12:03.097,00:12:05.349,I saw him go down.
00:12:06.600,00:12:08.227,I didn't see a thing.
00:12:13.524,00:12:16.318,"We won't let them bury this, Lou."
00:14:11.767,00:14:14.353,This canvas appeals to you?
00:14:15.396,00:14:17.898,I like the look of agony.
00:14:19.608,00:14:21.277,Why?
00:14:22.236,00:14:24.738,Because I know it's true.
00:14:33.539,00:14:34.623,What am I doing here?
00:14:35.666,00:14:38.460,Umberto Calvini is disengaging from the deal.
00:14:38.961,00:14:43.382,Your principle would like to bring you in to troubleshoot the situation.
00:14:44.341,00:14:48.470,"If Calvini refuses to move forward, my involvement won't make a difference."
00:14:48.637,00:14:51.974,Your involvement would allow them to appeal to Calvini's two sons...
00:14:52.141,00:14:54.226,...who are much more open-minded.
00:14:55.603,00:14:58.480,You'll find all the details in the file.
00:15:07.531,00:15:10.618,I'll contact you once negotiations are underway.
00:16:08.092,00:16:09.510,MAN: Rene?
00:16:10.678,00:16:12.721,What are you doing here so early?
00:16:12.888,00:16:14.223,Salinger.
00:16:27.444,00:16:28.696,I found the insider.
00:16:29.488,00:16:30.698,What?
00:16:31.740,00:16:34.702,I found the guy that Schumer met with in Berlin.
00:16:35.828,00:16:36.912,André Clément?
00:16:37.079,00:16:40.207,The IBBC's senior vice president of acquisitions.
00:16:45.546,00:16:48.257,He was killed in a road accident just outside Luxembourg...
00:16:48.424,00:16:50.676,...approximately nine hours after Schumer's death.
00:16:50.843,00:16:53.595,And this is the gendarmerie's preliminary accident report.
00:16:54.763,00:16:57.016,He arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m...
00:16:57.933,00:17:00.769,"...on Luxair, Flight 9871 from Luxembourg."
00:17:01.270,00:17:04.773,"What doesn't track is in his statement, the IBBC chairman, Jonas Skarssen..."
00:17:04.940,00:17:08.402,...claims that Clément had been with him in Luxembourg since 10 a.m...
00:17:08.569,00:17:12.531,...which is obviously impossible if Clément arrived in Berlin at 8 a.m.
00:17:12.698,00:17:15.617,Did the gendarmerie say anything about this inconsistency?
00:17:16.326,00:17:17.745,Nothing.
00:17:17.911,00:17:19.705,-I haven't told them. -What?
00:17:19.872,00:17:22.541,I wanna go to Luxembourg and question Skarssen myself.
00:17:22.708,00:17:24.668,"-No. Absolutely no. -Viktor, listen to me."
00:17:24.835,00:17:27.838,"I go to Luxembourg, Skarssen confirms that statement..."
00:17:28.005,00:17:32.801,"...I catch him in that lie, I can build-- For chrissake, Lou, you're not at the Yard anymore."
00:17:32.968,00:17:35.596,Interpol is not in the law-enforcement business.
00:17:36.430,00:17:38.766,We deal in intelligence and facilitation.
00:17:39.183,00:17:43.437,"Focus on that, work that and pass your take onto the appropriate authorities."
00:17:43.604,00:17:44.730,And then what?
00:17:45.898,00:17:49.109,You know we've been circulating our take since the very beginning.
00:17:49.276,00:17:51.612,"No one ever does anything, no one ever can."
00:17:51.779,00:17:55.491,Whatever case we have gets lost in the complexities of international law.
00:17:56.617,00:18:00.329,"Schumer, Clément..."
00:18:00.496,00:18:03.165,...this entire fucking wall.
00:18:03.749,00:18:07.002,There's nothing that complex about cold-blooded murder.
00:18:26.855,00:18:28.982,Hi. I've got an appointment with Mr. Skarssen.
00:18:29.149,00:18:33.320,"-Your name, please? -Mr. Salinger? Please follow me."
00:19:15.737,00:19:16.738,Mr. Skarssen.
00:19:22.202,00:19:23.912,Mr. Skarssen.
00:19:30.544,00:19:32.713,Agent Salinger? Please follow me.
00:19:50.272,00:19:52.191,Mr. White.
00:19:52.441,00:19:55.694,Agent Salinger. I apologize for the wait.
00:19:55.861,00:19:58.864,"I'm Martin White, the IBBC's legal counsel."
00:19:59.031,00:20:01.366,This is Commissioner Villon of the gendarmerie.
00:20:01.533,00:20:05.287,"I thought it useful for him to join us, considering the nature of your query."
00:20:05.454,00:20:07.080,"Please, have a seat."
00:20:08.707,00:20:10.959,I think there's some misunderstanding.
00:20:11.126,00:20:13.962,I'm here to speak with Mr. Skarssen.
00:20:14.129,00:20:18.467,"Yes, but as Mr. Skarssen's attorney, I insisted that I speak with you first."
00:20:18.800,00:20:22.304,"Mr. White, I had a confirmed meeting with Mr. Skarssen at 11:00."
00:20:22.638,00:20:25.557,"If I was gonna meet with you first, why didn't anybody tell me?"
00:20:25.724,00:20:28.352,"I understand, and I'm sorry for the confusion..."
00:20:28.518,00:20:31.647,...but I'm sure I can help answer your questions.
00:20:31.813,00:20:34.608,"Now, please, have a seat."
00:20:55.254,00:20:56.505,As I'm sure you're aware...
00:20:56.672,00:20:58.966,...I have some questions regarding André Clément.
00:20:59.758,00:21:01.176,Yes.
00:21:02.427,00:21:04.846,It's my understanding that Mr. Clément was working...
00:21:05.013,00:21:08.016,...at Mr. Skarssen's residence the night he was killed.
00:21:08.183,00:21:10.686,"The night of the accident, yes."
00:21:11.770,00:21:14.189,What time did he arrive at Skarssen's home that day?
00:21:14.356,00:21:17.734,"If I recall correctly, around 6 p.m."
00:21:20.779,00:21:23.156,-You were there? -Yes.
00:21:24.741,00:21:26.410,And you're certain about this time?
00:21:27.369,00:21:28.912,Quite.
00:21:29.454,00:21:31.206,I'm confused.
00:21:32.666,00:21:35.377,What you're telling me conflicts with Skarssen's statement...
00:21:35.544,00:21:37.838,...in the gendarmerie's accident report...
00:21:38.005,00:21:41.133,...which was that Clément had been working with him since 10 a.m.
00:21:42.050,00:21:44.303,I was present when Mr. Skarssen gave his statement.
00:21:44.469,00:21:47.723,-That is not what he said. -It is according to this report.
00:21:49.516,00:21:51.184,May I?
00:22:08.994,00:22:12.039,Oh. There is an error in the preliminary draft.
00:22:12.205,00:22:13.248,The time is wrong.
00:22:14.916,00:22:18.754,The finalized report here says Clément arrived at 6 p.m.
00:22:19.379,00:22:22.382,Clerical errors like this can happen from time to time.
00:22:22.549,00:22:24.926,This is why the gendarmerie discourages the release...
00:22:25.093,00:22:28.430,...of any preliminary documentation pertaining to open cases.
00:22:30.474,00:22:34.102,"So is there anything else we can do for you, Agent Salinger?"
00:22:44.571,00:22:45.614,-Yeah. ELEANOR: It's me.
00:22:45.781,00:22:48.658,I just got the results from the tox analysis I ran on Schumer.
00:22:48.825,00:22:51.870,-And? -It's inconclusive.
00:22:52.037,00:22:54.498,Inconclusive? What the hell is that supposed to mean?
00:22:54.664,00:22:57.292,They found trace elements of cyanide in his blood...
00:22:57.459,00:22:59.586,...but the levels are not nearly high enough...
00:22:59.753,00:23:02.214,...to meet their criteria for poisoning.
00:23:04.049,00:23:05.300,Are you there?
00:23:24.319,00:23:25.946,Sorry.
00:23:28.281,00:23:30.283,I'm sorry.
00:23:58.854,00:24:00.856,-Madame Clément? -Oui.
00:24:01.857,00:24:03.024,Oh.
00:24:03.191,00:24:06.361,It's Eleanor Whitman from the New York District Attorney's office.
00:24:07.112,00:24:30.886,"I already left a couple messages just-- Mrs. Clément, I'm sorry to keep calling you."
00:24:31.052,00:24:34.556,I can only imagine what a difficult time this must be for you.
00:24:35.473,00:24:39.311,But I'm not convinced your husband's death was an accident.
00:24:41.354,00:24:43.064,"Look, here's my cell number."
00:24:43.231,00:24:48.486,001-917-135-6565.
00:24:48.653,00:24:54.743,You can call any time-- Stop calling me. I have nothing to say to you. Just leave me alone.
00:24:54.910,00:24:57.746,Please. I just need to ask you a few questions.
00:24:57.913,00:25:00.582,I have two children. They've already lost their father.
00:25:00.749,00:25:04.753,"-I understand. -No, you don't."
00:25:07.047,00:25:09.591,Are you aware your husband met with our investigators...
00:25:09.758,00:25:11.551,...the day he was killed?
00:25:19.517,00:25:21.394,You ever planning to come to bed?
00:25:22.145,00:25:24.773,-I heard your voice. -I'm sorry.
00:25:24.940,00:25:27.400,-When'd he come in here? -An hour ago.
00:25:28.068,00:25:29.861,T. rex was in the closet again.
00:25:31.279,00:25:32.697,Let me take him back.
00:25:34.199,00:25:35.867,"Come on, buddy."
00:27:14.716,00:27:15.717,Lou?
00:27:16.301,00:27:18.386,They knew about the discrepancy in the report.
00:27:18.553,00:27:21.056,They had Skarssen's statement changed.
00:27:21.222,00:27:22.682,"How did they know, Viktor?"
00:27:23.850,00:27:24.893,-Come inside. -No.
00:27:27.437,00:27:30.065,Are you insane? It's freezing out.
00:27:30.357,00:27:31.733,Come outside.
00:27:31.900,00:27:33.485,Stop it!
00:27:40.825,00:27:42.619,"Lou, wait."
00:27:44.162,00:27:45.246,Lou.
00:27:48.083,00:27:50.251,Have you lost your mind?
00:28:04.265,00:28:06.684,I think we take the dog for a walk.
00:28:07.018,00:28:09.062,Get some fresh air.
00:28:20.824,00:28:22.450,Who did this?
00:28:22.617,00:28:23.952,Who do you think?
00:28:25.078,00:28:26.246,From my apartment.
00:28:26.913,00:28:29.082,Whitman's got them too.
00:28:29.582,00:28:32.001,We need to inform the secretary general immediately.
00:28:32.168,00:28:33.378,You gotta be kidding.
00:28:33.545,00:28:36.214,"We start setting off alarms, the opportunity will be lost."
00:28:36.381,00:28:37.465,Opportunity?
00:28:37.632,00:28:39.259,The last thing Schumer told Ella...
00:28:39.426,00:28:43.805,...was that Clément was giving him information on an IBBC arms deal.
00:28:46.057,00:28:47.267,Umberto Calvini.
00:28:47.434,00:28:50.729,"Chairman of Calvini Defense, one of the largest defense contractors."
00:28:50.895,00:28:53.314,And probably Italy's next prime minister.
00:28:53.481,00:28:56.234,"This guy standing next to him, that's our insider."
00:28:57.110,00:28:58.319,André Clément.
00:28:59.112,00:29:00.655,And?
00:29:00.822,00:29:03.700,Whitman found out that Clément was negotiating for the IBBC...
00:29:03.867,00:29:06.286,...to purchase a large number of missile-guidance...
00:29:06.453,00:29:08.663,...and control systems from Calvini Defense.
00:29:08.830,00:29:11.249,"But at the very last minute, the deal collapsed."
00:29:11.416,00:29:12.459,What happened?
00:29:12.625,00:29:15.795,We don't know. Whitman's meeting me in Milan tomorrow.
00:29:15.962,00:29:17.922,We're gonna talk to Calvini and find out.
00:31:01.276,00:31:03.111,-Hey. -Hey.
00:31:03.987,00:31:06.322,"Eleanor Whitman, this is Inspector Alberto Cerutti."
00:31:06.489,00:31:08.575,-Charmed. -Nice to meet you.
00:31:08.741,00:31:10.118,"ALBERTO: Please, there's not much time."
00:31:10.285,00:31:12.954,Calvini leaves for Turin immediately after this engagement.
00:31:13.121,00:31:15.665,I didn't realize we were meeting at a political rally.
00:31:15.832,00:31:18.459,ALBERTO: Best we could do on such short notice.
00:31:22.755,00:31:25.675,Thirtieth floor. I'll be waiting outside.
00:31:34.350,00:31:35.768,You need to press the button.
00:31:42.609,00:31:44.652,You look awful.
00:31:44.819,00:31:46.821,Thanks.
00:31:48.489,00:31:50.742,When was the last time you got any sleep?
00:31:51.117,00:31:52.827,Don't know.
00:31:55.788,00:31:57.999,When was the last time you had a healthy meal?
00:31:58.458,00:32:00.168,Can't remember.
00:32:01.544,00:32:04.714,"-How about the last time you got laid? -Why, are you offering?"
00:32:06.716,00:32:09.802,"You need to take better care of yourself, Lou."
00:32:09.969,00:32:12.764,I can't have you crash and burn like you did two years ago.
00:32:16.392,00:32:18.186,Please follow me.
00:32:19.062,00:32:20.939,This meeting is strictly off the record.
00:32:21.105,00:32:24.442,Mr. Calvini cannot be entangled in your investigation...
00:32:24.609,00:32:28.655,...nor can his participation in this discussion find its way to the press.
00:32:28.821,00:32:29.822,We understand.
00:32:30.406,00:32:32.867,Wait here for a moment.
00:32:34.577,00:32:36.871,So you read my file.
00:32:37.372,00:32:39.540,I made a few calls to London.
00:32:39.707,00:32:41.376,You should've told me everything...
00:32:41.542,00:32:45.713,...with your IBBC case at the Yard. You should've told me it's why you left.
00:32:46.339,00:32:48.216,What did they tell you?
00:32:49.092,00:32:52.178,That you screwed up because the witness you brought in was a joke.
00:32:52.345,00:32:55.223,"And when you were forced to drop him, the case fell apart."
00:32:55.390,00:32:58.726,"You flipped out, attacked the assistant commissioner and broke his nose."
00:32:58.893,00:33:02.522,"My case did not fall apart, it was shut down, and my witness was rock-solid."
00:33:03.231,00:33:05.650,He gave us everything we needed against the bank...
00:33:05.817,00:33:09.153,"...and then suddenly, out of nowhere, my AC forced me to cut him loose."
00:33:09.320,00:33:12.073,"Three days later, they all died in a car crash."
00:33:14.117,00:33:16.703,-They? -He had a wife and two kids.
00:33:19.163,00:33:22.834,"ELEANOR: Mr. Calvini, we'd like to know why the IBBC, a bank..."
00:33:23.001,00:33:26.295,...would be purchasing millions of dollars' worth of missile-guidance...
00:33:26.462,00:33:28.339,...and control systems from your company.
00:33:31.009,00:33:34.262,The IBBC has purchased billions of dollars' worth...
00:33:34.429,00:33:38.266,...of Silkworm missiles from the People's Republic of China...
00:33:38.433,00:33:41.686,...which they have presold to clients in the Middle East...
00:33:41.853,00:33:43.438,...contingent upon the missiles...
00:33:43.604,00:33:46.274,...being equipped with VOLCON guidance systems.
00:33:46.858,00:33:51.279,My company's one of only two in the world which produce the VOLCON.
00:33:51.446,00:33:55.783,-Who's the other? -Sunay. Ahmet Sunay.
00:33:55.950,00:33:57.577,Of Turkish Aerotech?
00:33:59.203,00:34:02.123,But why is the bank committing so much capital and resources...
00:34:02.290,00:34:04.542,...to the sale of these missiles?
00:34:08.838,00:34:09.881,It's a test.
00:34:11.966,00:34:13.760,Small arms are the only weapons used...
00:34:13.926,00:34:17.263,...in 99 percent of the world's conflicts...
00:34:17.889,00:34:20.391,...and no one has the capacity to manufacture them...
00:34:20.558,00:34:23.394,...faster and cheaper than China.
00:34:23.936,00:34:26.272,What Skarssen is attempting to do...
00:34:26.689,00:34:29.817,...is to make the IBBC the exclusive broker...
00:34:30.193,00:34:33.654,...of Chinese small arms to the Third World.
00:34:34.238,00:34:37.492,And the missile deal is the gateway transaction.
00:34:37.867,00:34:41.662,"Yeah, but billions of dollars invested simply to be a broker?"
00:34:41.829,00:34:43.498,There can't be much profit for them.
00:34:43.664,00:34:47.418,No. This is not about making profit from weapon sales.
00:34:49.170,00:34:51.255,It's about control.
00:34:52.507,00:34:56.427,"Control the flow of weapons, control the conflict."
00:34:56.594,00:34:58.012,No.
00:34:58.971,00:35:01.808,"No, no. The IBBC is a bank."
00:35:02.266,00:35:05.728,Their objective isn't to control the conflict...
00:35:05.895,00:35:09.315,...it's to control the debt that the conflict produces.
00:35:09.857,00:35:13.277,"You see, the real value of a conflict..."
00:35:13.444,00:35:14.779,...the true value...
00:35:15.196,00:35:18.032,...is in the debt that it creates.
00:35:18.199,00:35:20.451,You control the debt...
00:35:21.244,00:35:23.371,...you control everything.
00:35:25.581,00:35:27.875,"You find this upsetting, yes?"
00:35:28.543,00:35:32.255,But this is the very essence of the banking industry...
00:35:32.463,00:35:37.677,"...to make us all, whether we be nations or individuals..."
00:35:37.844,00:35:40.179,...slaves to debt.
00:35:41.139,00:35:43.850,You sound like you're not very fond of the IBBC.
00:35:45.017,00:35:46.894,What happened?
00:35:48.521,00:35:50.648,I was fond of André Clément.
00:35:51.399,00:35:53.317,I trusted him...
00:35:53.484,00:35:55.194,...and he was a good friend.
00:36:03.494,00:36:06.414,Then help us make sure he didn't die in vain.
00:36:08.249,00:36:10.042,Find me after the speech.
00:36:10.209,00:36:12.837,We can talk in the car on my way to the airport.
00:36:28.060,00:36:30.479,Umberto Calvini.
00:38:05.032,00:41:05.129,"Definitely connected to any-- Oh, my God. Are you all right?"
00:41:05.296,00:41:06.338,I think so.
00:41:06.505,00:41:08.799,Take that left. Maybe you can cut him off.
00:41:08.966,00:41:10.468,ELEANOR: Go.
00:41:11.135,00:41:12.219,Go!
00:42:20.704,00:42:21.747,Turn off the engine...
00:42:21.914,00:42:24.291,...and stick your hands out of the window!
00:42:25.209,00:42:26.460,Turn off the engine...
00:42:26.627,00:42:29.713,...and stick your hands out of the window! Now!
00:42:46.981,00:42:51.652,Our relationship with the Swiss has become impossible over the past year.
00:42:51.819,00:42:53.821,They are discounting our dollar deposits...
00:42:53.988,00:42:56.365,...by 160 basis points below par.
00:42:56.532,00:42:58.826,They have doubled the cost of moving our money.
00:42:58.993,00:43:01.787,"Well, general, what do you expect?"
00:43:01.996,00:43:03.831,You've been in the jungle long enough...
00:43:03.998,00:43:07.042,"...to know that when the lion kills, it's the jackal that profits."
00:43:07.209,00:43:08.711,Yes.
00:43:09.336,00:43:11.213,The IBBC is specifically structured...
00:43:11.380,00:43:14.300,...to handle the particular needs of your type of organization.
00:43:14.800,00:43:17.845,We can give you better rates and terms than other competitors...
00:43:18.846,00:43:22.349,...but we can offer you much more: Weapons...
00:43:22.808,00:43:25.269,"...intelligence, logistical support..."
00:43:25.436,00:43:27.855,...everything that the Revolutionary Freedom Front...
00:43:28.022,00:43:30.065,...would need to revive itself.
00:43:30.274,00:43:32.484,But in exchange for what?
00:43:32.651,00:43:36.196,"You must understand, the RFF has no money."
00:43:39.033,00:43:44.163,Money is not this institution's primary medium of exchange.
00:43:47.583,00:43:50.127,What are you proposing exactly?
00:43:50.794,00:43:53.714,"We believe that, with the right kind of direction and support..."
00:43:53.881,00:43:57.051,...the RFF could become a very influential force in your country.
00:43:57.551,00:43:58.886,Perhaps potent enough...
00:43:59.053,00:44:02.264,...to stage a successful coup in the coming months.
00:44:04.391,00:44:06.602,And if this were possible...
00:44:07.019,00:44:09.938,...what does your bank hope to gain from it?
00:44:12.358,00:44:17.071,The gratitude and consideration of a very influential friend.
00:44:18.739,00:44:20.532,Excuse me.
00:44:21.075,00:44:23.744,Mr. White and Mr. Ehames asked me to interrupt.
00:44:25.537,00:44:28.290,"Would you excuse me, general? I'll be right back."
00:44:41.428,00:44:42.763,What is it?
00:44:48.143,00:44:51.522,"Approximately 30 minutes ago, Umberto Calvini was assassinated..."
00:44:51.688,00:44:54.942,...while giving a speech at a political rally in Milan.
00:44:58.362,00:44:59.947,We've been discussing it.
00:45:00.322,00:45:03.784,I think we should wait until the authorities resolve the matter...
00:45:03.951,00:45:07.413,...and then approach the sons to revive negotiations.
00:45:08.038,00:45:09.123,How long will this take?
00:45:09.289,00:45:13.252,I've been assured the investigation will move swiftly...
00:45:14.169,00:45:18.382,"...but, uh, unexpected fallout of an event like this can always complicate things."
00:45:21.343,00:45:22.970,There's no time for complications.
00:45:23.137,00:45:26.265,That's a risk you take with such an ambitious agenda.
00:45:26.849,00:45:29.852,I don't foresee any problems. Had it not been for their father...
00:45:30.018,00:45:33.063,...Mario and Enzo Calvini would have made our deal long ago.
00:45:33.230,00:45:35.649,Now there's no reason for them not to move forward.
00:45:36.817,00:45:40.112,An important man and devoted father has just been killed.
00:45:42.239,00:45:44.533,I suggest we send a letter to Calvini's family...
00:45:44.700,00:45:48.912,...extending our heartfelt prayers and condolences for their terrible loss.
00:45:50.164,00:45:51.748,"ELEANOR: I don't know, but I'm okay."
00:45:51.915,00:45:54.334,The doctors checked me out thoroughly.
00:45:55.002,00:45:56.962,"Kiss Jake for me, will you?"
00:46:04.303,00:46:07.639,ALBERTO: So the shooter was identified as a member of the Red Brigade.
00:46:07.806,00:46:09.516,ELEANOR: What about the guy in the car?
00:46:09.683,00:46:12.936,"ALBERTO: Car was stolen. They were unable to lift prints, fibers or residue..."
00:46:13.103,00:46:16.356,...or locate any witnesses who saw him exiting the vehicle.
00:46:16.523,00:46:18.650,-So? -So the carabinieri are announcing...
00:46:18.817,00:46:20.694,...that the Red Brigade was responsible...
00:46:20.861,00:46:23.530,...for the assassination at the press conference tonight.
00:46:23.697,00:46:25.949,LOUIS: We're not convinced the Red Brigade's behind this.
00:46:26.116,00:46:28.869,Someone could simply be making it appear as though they are.
00:46:30.204,00:46:31.622,This isn't my case...
00:46:31.788,00:46:34.791,...and the man in charge of the investigation is very powerful...
00:46:34.958,00:46:36.210,...and a real bastard.
00:46:36.376,00:46:39.671,All we wanna do is just look around a little.
00:47:02.736,00:47:04.404,-Antonio. -Alberto.
00:47:04.905,00:47:06.240,Just a moment.
00:47:33.934,00:47:36.019,They done the trajectory analysis yet?
00:47:37.104,00:47:39.273,Cerutti said no.
00:48:59.269,00:49:02.522,"If there was a second shooter, he could've positioned himself here."
00:49:04.274,00:49:06.026,The stopwatch they found in the room...
00:49:06.193,00:49:08.278,"...it was set on a one-minute countdown, yes?"
00:49:08.445,00:49:11.948,Right. Calvini was killed a little over one minute into his speech.
00:49:12.699,00:49:15.202,What if this was all synchronized?
00:49:18.955,00:49:20.666,Okay...
00:49:22.376,00:49:24.169,...let's say I'm the second shooter.
00:49:25.587,00:49:27.339,The guy below doesn't know I'm here...
00:49:27.506,00:49:30.175,...but I'm positioned right above his room.
00:49:31.426,00:49:35.138,"I'm armed with a Sauer 200 rifle, just like he is."
00:49:36.014,00:49:38.475,I have a stopwatch set on a one-minute countdown...
00:49:38.642,00:49:41.061,...which I start when Calvini begins his speech.
00:49:41.228,00:49:43.730,The sniper below has been instructed to do the same...
00:49:43.897,00:49:46.566,...because that's when he's gonna fire his first bullet.
00:49:46.733,00:49:51.071,"If he misses, I'm ready to follow through with one of my own."
00:49:51.905,00:49:53.990,"The sniper fires, misses."
00:49:54.324,00:49:55.742,Seconds later...
00:49:57.035,00:49:58.829,...I take Calvini out with a headshot.
00:50:00.455,00:50:03.125,"It's a good theory, but there's one problem."
00:50:03.291,00:50:05.001,Why?
00:50:07.546,00:50:10.048,Two shots were fired from the window...
00:50:10.215,00:50:12.008,...two slugs were recovered...
00:50:12.175,00:50:14.511,...and two casings were found next to the gun...
00:50:14.678,00:50:18.265,...ballistics confirming that the casings came from the gun in the hotel room.
00:50:18.432,00:50:21.560,So if the kill shot came from a second shooter here on the roof...
00:50:21.727,00:50:24.438,...that'd be a total of three bullets fired.
00:50:24.604,00:50:26.940,How do you explain the absence of the third bullet?
00:50:29.526,00:50:31.319,I can't.
00:50:59.556,00:51:01.975,I think I've seen this print before.
00:51:02.642,00:51:04.102,ELEANOR: Where?
00:51:04.269,00:51:06.146,Hanging on the wall of my office.
00:51:21.620,00:51:25.415,So this was lifted from the scene of the Stefan Heuss hit in Brussels last year.
00:51:25.582,00:51:27.709,A former IMF executive director.
00:51:27.876,00:51:30.003,Has he ever seen a tread pattern like this before?
00:51:38.804,00:51:42.516,He believes it came from a custom shoe made for a leg brace.
00:51:42.682,00:51:44.768,The braces are typically made out of steel...
00:51:44.935,00:51:46.937,"...or alloy, but the condition of the leg..."
00:51:47.103,00:51:49.147,...would determine the specific type of device used.
00:51:51.691,00:51:53.944,He says that the prints are a probable match.
00:51:56.613,00:52:00.075,Please get these over to Alan Kovacs at FBI Impressions right away...
00:52:00.242,00:52:02.994,...and make sure he has my contact numbers.
00:52:03.954,00:52:05.622,Thanks.
00:52:06.623,00:52:09.376,"Ella, if the FBI confirms that these prints are a match..."
00:52:09.543,00:52:11.962,...it means the bank's used the same assassin twice.
00:52:12.879,00:52:16.842,"Which means if we can get him, we can get the bank."
00:52:51.376,00:52:52.669,What was that?
00:52:57.340,00:53:00.927,"That was Capitano Barillo, the man in charge of the Calvini investigation."
00:53:01.094,00:53:04.347,-What did he want? -My ass on a platter...
00:53:04.514,00:53:06.850,...and both of you on the next flight out of Milan.
00:53:07.017,00:53:09.227,Didn't you tell him what we just found?
00:53:09.394,00:53:10.896,I tried.
00:53:11.062,00:53:14.107,Fuck him. He can't force us to leave.
00:53:14.274,00:53:16.902,ALBERTO: He has already spoken to your superiors.
00:53:17.068,00:53:19.237,You have both been ordered home.
00:53:20.030,00:53:21.948,"Arnie, you can't just sit there..."
00:53:22.115,00:53:24.242,...and lecture me about protocol and procedure.
00:53:24.409,00:53:26.202,You know what's happening here.
00:53:26.369,00:53:28.914,"Well, who gives a shit about jurisdictional provenance?"
00:53:29.080,00:53:31.291,We just had a major breakthrough.
00:53:32.500,00:53:35.378,"That's great, Arnie. You're a real stand-up guy."
00:53:35.545,00:53:37.714,This is total bullshit.
00:53:38.298,00:53:40.216,I wish I could have been more helpful.
00:53:40.383,00:53:42.344,"Oh, no, you've been great, Alberto."
00:53:42.510,00:53:45.513,I'm gonna do everything I can to take the heat off you.
00:53:45.680,00:53:47.349,ALBERTO: Ciao. -Thanks.
00:53:48.308,00:53:51.728,LOUIS: Thanks for everything. Sorry for all the trouble we caused.
00:54:04.032,00:54:05.075,What?
00:54:05.241,00:54:07.661,"His leg brace would be made of metal, right?"
00:54:08.495,00:54:11.247,-So? -So if he left through an airport...
00:54:11.414,00:54:13.667,...security would have made him show it to them.
00:54:32.852,00:54:34.521,LOUIS: That's definitely him.
00:54:34.688,00:54:38.358,-He doesn't look like much. -I think that's the idea.
00:54:39.109,00:54:40.777,Seems to know where the cameras are.
00:54:40.944,00:54:43.905,Look how he always angles his face just out of our line of sight.
00:54:44.072,00:54:45.532,ALBERTO: Even if you do find him...
00:54:45.699,00:54:48.952,...that's not enough evidence to convict the man without a confession.
00:54:49.119,00:54:52.372,"If we find him, prosecution will be irrelevant. He'll be a marked man."
00:54:52.539,00:54:54.582,He can either die for the bank or flip for us.
00:54:56.209,00:55:00.714,"I got him. He is traveling under the name Sherwood, Timothy M."
00:55:00.880,00:55:05.051,"He boarded Flight Alitalia 422, departing Milan at 6 p.m. yesterday..."
00:55:05.218,00:55:07.679,...and arriving in New York at JFK at 10 p.m.
00:55:10.056,00:55:12.058,What time's the next flight to New York?
00:55:52.640,00:55:56.061,"Detectives Hubbard, Ward, Ornelas, this is Agent Lou Salinger."
00:55:56.227,00:55:57.312,-Finally. -How you doing?
00:55:57.479,00:56:00.106,"-Let me take that. -Thanks. So, what do we have?"
00:56:00.273,00:56:01.399,"ORNELAS: Well, we got lucky."
00:56:02.233,00:56:05.195,Some clip shots of him moving through customs.
00:56:05.361,00:56:07.238,That's a good one.
00:56:08.698,00:56:12.702,The Sherwood ID he used? It's clean. All of it attached to a dead address.
00:56:12.869,00:56:14.704,Where'd he go after he cleared customs?
00:56:14.871,00:56:17.749,Don't know. CCTV footage lost him at the curb.
00:56:17.916,00:56:20.960,We canvassed all the limousine and taxicab companies in the city.
00:56:21.127,00:56:25.048,"Airport parking, rental agencies. Didn't come up with shit."
00:56:25.215,00:56:27.300,There's a chance he might live in the city.
00:56:27.467,00:56:28.635,Why is that?
00:56:29.302,00:56:31.721,Kovacs from FBI Impressions called.
00:56:32.347,00:56:36.976,The footprint was left by a shoe used for knee-ankle-foot orthosis.
00:56:37.352,00:56:40.146,The tread pattern is exclusive to shoes produced...
00:56:40.313,00:56:43.650,...at the Isaacson Orthopedic Institute here in the city.
00:56:43.817,00:56:45.777,The shoe could have only come from there.
00:56:45.944,00:56:48.196,Do you have a contact person to run down?
00:56:48.363,00:56:49.948,We got Dr. Isaacson.
00:56:51.241,00:56:54.744,All right. You guys go check it out. I'm expected at the office.
00:56:54.911,00:56:55.954,Hubb?
00:56:56.121,00:56:59.290,Get ready for the smackdown. He's gonna come at you hard.
00:57:42.834,00:57:45.545,ISAACSON: Who is it? -N.Y.P.D.
00:57:48.298,00:57:49.924,-Dr. Isaacson? -Yeah.
00:57:50.091,00:57:53.178,"Detective Ornelas, N.Y.P.D. This is my partner, Detective Ward."
00:57:53.344,00:57:55.680,-We'd like to ask a couple questions. -Why?
00:57:56.014,00:57:57.599,What do you want? Why are you here?
00:57:57.765,00:58:01.436,Calm down. We just wanna ask you a few questions about a patient.
00:58:01.603,00:58:04.230,"Patient? What patient? Come on, you know what time it is?"
00:58:04.814,00:58:07.984,"Uh-uh-uh. Listen, I'm sorry. I must go. I really didn't do anything."
00:58:08.151,00:58:16.618,"-I'm sorry. Good night. -Doctor, if we could-- Douche bag's pinned out of his mind. He thinks we're here to bust him."
00:58:19.037,00:58:20.872,"Dr. Isaacson, please."
00:58:21.039,00:58:24.334,"We have reason to believe your life is in danger, grave danger."
00:58:25.376,00:58:28.254,We think one of your patients is trying to kill you.
00:58:33.510,00:58:34.552,Kill me?
00:58:34.719,00:58:38.097,I'm Agent Salinger with Interpol. We're assisting in this manhunt.
00:58:38.264,00:58:41.726,Why would a patient wanna kill me? I'm an orthopedist.
00:58:41.893,00:58:45.230,This man's a psychotic. He's already butchered seven doctors in Europe.
00:58:45.396,00:58:48.274,We got some serious evidence to suggest you may be next.
00:58:48.441,00:58:49.776,Have you ever seen this man?
00:58:52.111,00:58:54.906,"No, no. I don't think so."
00:58:55.073,00:58:58.660,"Does the name Timothy Sherwood mean anything to you, doctor?"
00:58:58.826,00:59:01.621,No. How do you know he's a patient of mine?
00:59:01.788,00:59:02.872,We have his footprint.
00:59:03.039,00:59:05.625,"Yeah, the shoe was manufactured by AGM Biomechanics..."
00:59:05.792,00:59:10.129,"...exclusively for the Isaacson Institute, model K-A-F-O 1-2-1."
00:59:10.296,00:59:12.131,K-A-F-O 1-2-1?
00:59:12.298,00:59:14.425,We started prescribing that three years ago.
00:59:14.759,00:59:16.636,We've used it on hundreds of our patients.
00:59:16.803,00:59:19.931,"Well, then we're gonna need to review all of your files."
00:59:20.473,00:59:21.641,Right now?
00:59:21.808,00:59:25.853,"LOUIS: Doctor, we need to find this man before he finds you."
00:59:27.480,00:59:31.150,ARNIE: What are you trying to do here? -I'm doing my job.
00:59:31.317,00:59:33.945,You have any idea of the shitstorm you've gotten me into?
00:59:34.112,00:59:36.739,-We're just trying to get to the truth. -I get it.
00:59:37.323,00:59:41.244,"You need to remember there's what people wanna hear, wanna believe..."
00:59:41.411,00:59:43.871,"...there's everything else, then there's the truth."
00:59:44.038,00:59:47.375,And since when is that okay? I can't believe you're saying this to me.
00:59:47.542,00:59:49.669,"The truth means responsibility, Arnie."
00:59:49.836,00:59:52.839,"Exactly, which is why everyone dreads it."
00:59:57.885,00:59:59.554,Look....
01:00:03.516,01:00:08.229,The IBBC is using one assassin for all their hits...
01:00:08.646,01:00:11.482,...and we've tracked him here to New York.
01:00:13.067,01:00:15.778,This guy can bury them.
01:00:18.781,01:00:21.993,They want me to put a gun to your head.
01:00:22.368,01:00:25.163,"You don't find this guy, and I mean quick..."
01:00:25.330,01:00:27.624,...they're gonna make me pull the trigger.
01:00:57.028,01:00:59.822,Sorry to disturb you at home. I'm afraid this couldn't wait.
01:01:00.573,01:01:01.824,Yes?
01:01:01.991,01:01:04.243,Salinger was in Milan.
01:01:04.410,01:01:05.953,WHITE: Whitman too.
01:01:06.120,01:01:07.413,MAN: They have the scent.
01:01:07.580,01:01:11.501,It's only a matter of time before they find our consultant.
01:01:18.549,01:01:20.093,Any recommendations?
01:01:20.259,01:01:22.345,I strongly advise against doing anything...
01:01:22.512,01:01:24.931,...that would heighten your exposure right now.
01:01:25.098,01:01:27.433,"WHITE: Wilhelm, we've leveraged ourselves over the edge."
01:01:27.600,01:01:30.603,"If we don't meet the delivery date, buyers will cancel orders..."
01:01:30.770,01:01:32.105,...our plans will implode...
01:01:32.271,01:01:34.691,...and this bank will be left a bill it cannot pay.
01:01:34.857,01:01:37.110,Heightening exposure is the least of our problems.
01:01:37.276,01:01:39.612,I agree. We're about to engage Calvini's sons.
01:01:39.779,01:01:41.948,We can't allow anyone to put our agenda at risk.
01:01:42.115,01:01:44.450,We must sever all ties with the consultant.
01:01:44.617,01:01:46.828,"Consider the mark, gentlemen."
01:01:46.994,01:01:51.958,Doing this could be a very messy affair.
01:01:52.125,01:01:54.419,"MAN: Well, then make it one."
01:01:54.585,01:01:57.213,WEXLER: I don't know why you pay me to advise on these matters.
01:01:57.380,01:02:01.300,"It is clear that you don't want my counsel, only my corroboration."
01:02:01.467,01:02:05.096,"Really, Wilhelm. We've had just about all we can take of you."
01:02:05.263,01:02:10.268,Yes. I've had about all I can take of myself.
01:02:11.144,01:02:13.479,How would you like us to proceed?
01:02:22.280,01:02:51.517,"CASSIAN: -Fucking disgusting, you know that? -What are you, my mother?"
01:02:51.684,01:02:54.645,"No, but I could be your old man for all you know, asshole."
01:03:05.698,01:03:07.325,"Hey, doc."
01:03:09.702,01:03:11.120,Gabriel Hansen?
01:03:11.829,01:03:15.416,I don't know. My associate handled this.
01:03:16.292,01:03:19.045,"Well, the address is a post-office box..."
01:03:19.796,01:03:22.465,...and he paid cash for all of his medical bills.
01:03:23.883,01:03:27.553,There are no diagnostic photos. Why?
01:03:29.472,01:03:31.307,-I don't know. -Is there a number?
01:03:31.474,01:03:37.271,"Yeah, 212-157-6421."
01:03:43.110,01:03:44.153,It's a dead line.
01:03:50.284,01:03:52.578,"I'll put a call in to Hubby, have her run it down."
01:03:52.745,01:03:55.581,See if we can't get a crack warrant for the P.O. Box in Jersey.
01:04:00.127,01:04:03.673,What do all these GT's next to the appointment entries mean?
01:04:04.257,01:04:06.926,We have a kickback account with Go Taxi...
01:04:07.426,01:04:10.221,...and they indicate when we use their service for a patient.
01:04:12.890,01:04:14.684,ELEANOR: Hey. Hubb says you caught a lead.
01:04:17.019,01:04:18.646,"-What is it? -Well, it could be him."
01:04:18.813,01:04:20.106,-Really? -Yeah.
01:04:20.273,01:04:23.109,"Well, they gotta bring him in now. This is our last shot."
01:04:23.276,01:04:24.902,"What do you mean, our last shot?"
01:04:25.069,01:04:27.947,"Arnie and I had it out last night, and our clock's run out."
01:04:28.447,01:04:32.243,"If we don't get this guy right now, it's over."
01:04:33.995,01:04:36.289,"Well, it better be him, then."
01:04:48.217,01:04:50.595,I'm here. Yeah.
01:04:53.890,01:04:54.932,I know that.
01:04:55.099,01:04:56.934,LOUIS: This is definitely the right address?
01:04:57.101,01:04:58.853,ORNELAS: Checked the log myself.
01:04:59.020,01:05:01.147,This is where they dropped him off every time.
01:05:02.315,01:05:04.358,"Well, he could be anywhere."
01:05:07.278,01:05:09.989,-What do you think he was doing? -Beats the shit out of me.
01:05:10.156,01:05:11.240,"WARD: It's a big, empty lot."
01:05:11.407,01:05:14.327,"Well, I'm starving. I'm gonna get something. You want anything?"
01:05:14.493,01:05:15.494,"Yeah, a coffee, black."
01:05:15.661,01:05:18.080,WARD: I'm going back down to headquarters after this.
01:05:18.247,01:05:20.124,"Okay, all right."
01:05:27.715,01:05:28.966,"Right, bye."
01:05:29.133,01:05:30.968,How long do you think this has been like this?
01:05:31.135,01:05:33.012,"I don't know, but we need to find out."
01:05:33.179,01:05:35.056,The doctor's records say the last time...
01:05:35.222,01:05:38.142,...somebody got dropped off here was five weeks ago.
01:05:38.684,01:05:41.604,"I mean, there's not even a temporary office or anything."
01:05:42.229,01:05:44.273,-How you doing? -How you doing?
01:06:01.040,01:06:03.793,Son of a bitch.
01:06:09.215,01:06:10.299,What's the matter?
01:06:10.466,01:06:13.177,"I just made our perp. Eleven o'clock, blue overcoat."
01:06:15.805,01:06:18.391,-You sure that's him? -A hundred percent.
01:06:19.058,01:06:20.893,-Where did he come from? -Shit if I know.
01:06:21.060,01:06:23.854,I'm at the counter and I see him rolling past the window.
01:06:24.021,01:06:25.398,-Wanna go for the collar? LOUIS: No.
01:06:25.564,01:06:28.234,"We tail him, find out where he sleeps, then take him down."
01:06:28.401,01:06:31.404,"A, B, C. Keep the box tight."
01:07:52.985,01:07:54.195,Samuel Koppler.
01:07:55.988,01:08:00.826,Message: Your uncle wishes to see you immediately.
01:08:00.993,01:08:02.411,Response?
01:08:02.578,01:08:07.333,"The Guggenheim, fifth floor of the rotunda, 40 minutes."
01:08:52.962,01:08:54.713,"ORNELAS: Hi, how you doing? WOMAN: Hello."
01:08:54.880,01:08:57.258,ORNELAS: N.Y.P.D. I need to speak to your security chief.
01:08:57.424,01:08:58.551,"WOMAN: Okay, one moment."
01:08:59.635,01:09:01.220,Rick?
01:09:01.846,01:09:05.224,How you doing? Detective Ornelas. I need to be able to clear security.
01:09:05.391,01:09:06.851,-Okay. ORNELAS: Thanks.
01:09:12.022,01:09:13.732,We're clear.
01:09:45.181,01:09:47.558,Directly behind me.
01:09:55.316,01:09:57.193,There you go. Thank you.
01:10:48.077,01:10:50.246,Who's the old scag sitting next to him?
01:10:50.412,01:10:53.666,"I don't know, but I saw him at the bank's headquarters in Luxembourg."
01:10:54.250,01:10:56.961,You don't look well today.
01:10:57.336,01:10:59.838,We all begin better than we end.
01:11:00.547,01:11:03.008,What would you prefer your ending to be like?
01:11:03.175,01:11:08.138,"Oh, more purposeful, and certainly more climactic."
01:11:08.597,01:11:10.224,A finale.
01:11:10.849,01:11:12.476,A finale.
01:11:12.643,01:11:16.188,Circumstances can always be arranged.
01:11:17.189,01:11:19.066,As much as the thought appeals to me...
01:11:19.233,01:11:22.945,...I'm afraid your consideration is needed elsewhere.
01:11:23.779,01:11:26.365,-What is this? -Salinger.
01:11:26.865,01:11:29.743,The method and manner is entirely up to you.
01:11:29.910,01:11:35.165,Your principle would simply like him to vanish without a trace.
01:11:37.376,01:11:40.713,-Any other provisions? -Yes.
01:11:40.879,01:11:42.214,No mistakes.
01:11:45.551,01:11:47.386,I'll follow.
01:11:52.558,01:11:55.894,-Where's Iggy going? -Following a new lead.
01:12:24.631,01:12:26.050,Shit.
01:12:26.216,01:12:27.593,We gotta go.
01:12:29.219,01:12:32.348,N.Y.P.D. Lock your hands behind your head.
01:12:36.352,01:12:37.519,Do it now.
01:12:38.103,01:12:39.855,They'll never let you bring me in.
01:12:40.022,01:12:42.107,"Do it, or I'll take you down."
01:12:45.277,01:12:46.612,-Cuffs. -On the belt.
01:12:57.081,01:12:58.457,There's a guy right up there.
01:13:26.151,01:13:28.320,-Where'd he--? -Up there! Up there!
01:13:38.956,01:13:39.998,Get down!
01:13:46.755,01:13:48.674,"-God! Oh, my God! -It's okay."
01:13:51.385,01:13:52.428,Down there.
01:14:02.229,01:14:04.106,Shit.
01:14:24.334,01:14:25.377,Drop the gun.
01:14:26.628,01:14:30.382,"-If I drop the gun, we'll both die. -I said, drop the gun!"
01:14:30.549,01:14:34.553,They're here for me but they'll kill you too. Now help me get this off.
01:14:36.054,01:14:37.306,I can't breathe.
01:15:00.245,01:15:01.997,Stairs.
01:15:14.009,01:15:15.928,-Fuck. -You okay?
01:15:19.056,01:15:20.557,The ramp is the only way out.
01:17:35.776,01:17:37.444,Hey.
01:17:39.071,01:17:41.698,Don't you fucking dare.
01:18:37.129,01:19:19.963,-Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. -I'm calling from the-- Get back.
01:19:40.358,01:19:42.027,I told you.
01:19:44.029,01:19:46.448,What? You told me what?
01:19:47.949,01:19:50.869,They'd never let you bring me in.
01:20:17.020,01:20:18.063,"Fuck, fuck."
01:20:30.575,01:20:34.496,Can everybody please move away from the building?
01:20:53.056,01:20:54.975,They know you're coming. We gotta hurry.
01:20:55.141,01:20:58.603,ELEANOR: Where'd they find him? -Sitting on a bench near the reservoir.
01:20:59.104,01:21:02.357,-Has he said anything yet? -Nothing. He's pretty shaken up.
01:21:02.524,01:21:06.361,-Who else knows he's here? -Everyone. Nothing I could do.
01:21:06.528,01:21:08.947,Heavies from the Bureau and Justice are on their way.
01:21:11.032,01:21:13.785,"-How long do I have? -Five, 10 minutes, max."
01:21:13.952,01:21:16.538,--wanted for questioning in an ongoing investigation.
01:21:16.788,01:22:00.540,"Now, a Guggenheim employee tells me that while they were in the museum-- This isn't over."
01:22:18.600,01:22:20.268,Are you sure about this?
01:22:26.149,01:22:27.192,Just read it.
01:22:42.582,01:22:44.626,ELEANOR: They recognize you? -Don't think so.
01:22:49.089,01:22:51.049,MAN: Back it up!
01:23:34.884,01:23:38.263,-There was glass everywhere. -As compared to what?
01:23:38.430,01:23:40.265,And just on the ground.
01:23:43.435,01:23:45.395,"Anything you need, Ellie, just let me know."
01:23:47.772,01:23:49.941,And people were hit and screaming...
01:23:50.108,01:23:52.402,...and people just started running out the door...
01:23:52.569,01:23:54.320,...and I didn't know what was going on.
01:23:54.487,01:23:55.530,You okay?
01:23:56.281,01:23:57.824,Yeah.
01:23:59.659,01:24:01.786,You flip this guy.
01:24:02.245,01:24:05.206,You make sure my partner wasn't killed for nothing.
01:24:09.294,01:24:13.882,"I mean, there was police running up as other people were going down."
01:24:26.352,01:24:27.937,You ready for this?
01:25:04.557,01:25:07.102,"Good evening, Colonel Wexler."
01:25:08.853,01:25:11.523,I'm Agent Louis Salinger.
01:25:12.315,01:25:14.526,I know who you are.
01:25:16.361,01:25:18.488,Of course you do.
01:25:20.490,01:25:22.867,I was at the Guggenheim this afternoon.
01:25:25.036,01:25:26.704,The assassin you met with...
01:25:28.331,01:25:30.458,...I know you were his handler.
01:25:30.625,01:25:33.837,I know you arranged for him to be killed at the behest of the bank...
01:25:34.003,01:25:36.214,...because I was obviously getting too close.
01:25:39.509,01:25:42.220,But if a hit team at the Guggenheim is what happens...
01:25:42.387,01:25:45.223,...because I was getting too close to him...
01:25:47.767,01:25:51.521,...what do you think the bank will do when it realizes how close I am to you?
01:25:51.688,01:25:56.276,"Death comes for us all, Agent Salinger."
01:25:56.985,01:25:59.070,But based on everything I've read about you...
01:25:59.237,01:26:00.989,...you seem like the kind of man...
01:26:01.156,01:26:04.075,...who aspired to die for something more than this.
01:26:05.869,01:26:10.415,"Well, this is the difference between truth and fiction."
01:26:11.708,01:26:14.002,Fiction has to make sense.
01:26:16.754,01:26:18.673,"I'm confused, colonel."
01:26:21.801,01:26:24.053,Why would a tried and true communist...
01:26:25.096,01:26:27.515,...a hardliner that spent 30 years in the Stasi...
01:26:27.682,01:26:29.893,...fighting against the evils of capitalism....
01:26:30.560,01:26:33.771,Why would this man waste his final days working for an institution...
01:26:33.938,01:26:37.108,...that was the very embodiment of everything he once despised?
01:26:40.111,01:26:43.031,You dedicated your life to the communist ideal.
01:26:45.450,01:26:48.828,You sacrificed everything for the good of the party.
01:26:50.330,01:26:51.706,For what?
01:26:55.418,01:26:58.087,You lost your wife to betrayal...
01:26:58.671,01:27:01.216,...your daughter to suicide...
01:27:02.383,01:27:05.803,"...and when the Wall fell, your whole life fell apart with it."
01:27:06.095,01:27:08.389,You know nothing about me.
01:27:08.932,01:27:11.809,I was lost long before the Wall fell.
01:27:13.019,01:27:17.774,I was once destined to become a man much like yourself.
01:27:18.149,01:27:19.984,True-hearted...
01:27:20.318,01:27:22.320,...determined...
01:27:22.487,01:27:24.489,...full of purpose.
01:27:25.448,01:27:27.367,"But, um..."
01:27:27.825,01:27:30.578,...character is easier kept than recovered.
01:27:31.788,01:27:35.667,We cannot control the things life does to us.
01:27:36.334,01:27:40.296,"They are done before you know it, and once they are done..."
01:27:41.673,01:27:43.841,...they make you do other things...
01:27:44.425,01:27:47.679,"...until at last, everything comes between you..."
01:27:48.680,01:27:51.182,...and the man you wanted to be.
01:27:53.101,01:27:54.602,No.
01:27:56.521,01:27:59.691,We all have choices in life. You made yours.
01:28:07.073,01:28:08.825,Sometimes a man can meet his destiny...
01:28:08.992,01:28:10.952,...on the road he took to avoid it.
01:28:14.163,01:28:16.916,Skarssen and that bank need to answer for what they've done.
01:28:17.083,01:28:19.085,They have to be brought to justice.
01:28:19.252,01:28:21.212,You can help me do that.
01:28:21.546,01:28:23.381,Justice...
01:28:24.173,01:28:26.134,...is not possible.
01:28:26.759,01:28:28.261,Why not?
01:28:28.720,01:28:31.222,"Because, Agent Salinger..."
01:28:31.389,01:28:35.393,...your idea of justice is an illusion.
01:28:36.102,01:28:38.688,Understand the very system that you serve and protect...
01:28:38.855,01:28:42.400,...will never allow anything to happen to Skarssen or the bank.
01:28:42.984,01:28:44.569,On the contrary.
01:28:44.944,01:28:49.073,The system guarantees the IBBC's safety...
01:28:49.449,01:28:52.744,...because everyone is involved.
01:28:53.494,01:28:55.455,"What do you mean, everyone?"
01:28:58.249,01:28:59.751,Hezbollah.
01:29:00.251,01:29:02.211,CIA. Heh.
01:29:02.670,01:29:04.422,The Colombian drug cartels.
01:29:04.756,01:29:06.966,Russian organized crime.
01:29:07.133,01:29:10.595,"Governments of Iran, Germany, China, your government."
01:29:10.803,01:29:13.931,"Every multinational corporation, every one."
01:29:14.307,01:29:18.644,They all need banks like the IBBC...
01:29:18.811,01:29:23.733,...so that they can operate within the black and gray latitudes.
01:29:24.108,01:29:26.152,And this is why your investigative efforts...
01:29:26.319,01:29:29.947,...have either been ignored or undermined...
01:29:30.114,01:29:33.284,...and why you and I will be quietly disposed of...
01:29:34.243,01:29:39.290,...before any case against the bank ever reaches a court of law.
01:29:45.421,01:29:47.465,"So, what are we all supposed to do?"
01:29:50.802,01:29:53.096,We just supposed to give up...
01:29:53.346,01:29:56.140,...and accept that this is the way of the world?
01:30:00.603,01:30:02.396,I'm not gonna do that.
01:30:03.815,01:30:06.984,I still believe-- I know...
01:30:07.151,01:30:10.613,...that there has to be a way to bring down this bank...
01:30:11.197,01:30:13.616,...and you are gonna help me.
01:30:20.706,01:30:22.917,You understand...
01:30:24.252,01:30:28.005,...if you really want to stop the IBBC...
01:30:28.714,01:30:33.928,...you won't be able to do it within the boundaries of your system of justice.
01:30:34.512,01:30:36.931,You will have to go outside.
01:30:37.682,01:30:39.267,Once you do...
01:30:40.893,01:30:44.438,...there will always be collateral damage.
01:30:49.152,01:30:50.903,Yes.
01:30:51.946,01:30:56.367,Should you sacrifice your own ideals for the greater good?
01:30:57.535,01:31:01.372,"That's a difficult choice, one I understand all too well..."
01:31:02.248,01:31:04.542,...but as you so eloquently put it...
01:31:04.917,01:31:08.296,...sometimes a man can meet his destiny...
01:31:08.462,01:31:11.883,...on the road he took to avoid it.
01:31:23.769,01:31:24.896,ELEANOR: What?
01:31:25.062,01:31:26.355,What are you doing?
01:31:26.939,01:31:28.900,I think it's time for you to leave.
01:31:29.525,01:31:34.238,-Leave? What are you talking about? -You know what I'm talking about.
01:31:37.742,01:31:39.619,"No way, Lou."
01:31:39.785,01:31:42.705,No fucking way. You've already got him turned.
01:31:42.872,01:31:46.292,Now go back in there and get him to come in on his own.
01:31:46.792,01:31:49.879,We can use everything. We'll blow this whole thing wide open.
01:31:50.046,01:31:52.381,-I don't think so. -Why not?
01:31:52.548,01:31:54.592,I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
01:31:54.759,01:31:58.346,"-I can protect him, Lou. -No, you can't. They'll get to him."
01:31:58.512,01:32:00.097,"If they can't, they'll get to you."
01:32:00.264,01:32:02.725,"If they can't get to you, they'll get to your family."
01:32:15.404,01:32:17.615,I can't just walk away from this.
01:32:18.866,01:32:21.702,You're walking away so I don't have to.
01:32:30.628,01:32:32.088,How can you trust him?
01:32:32.505,01:32:35.591,That relic in there is looking for redemption.
01:32:35.758,01:32:37.927,I'm the only one who can give it to him.
01:32:38.970,01:32:41.806,Then who gives it to you when this is all over?
01:32:43.474,01:32:45.601,You need to cut me loose.
01:32:48.145,01:32:50.940,"Tell them I escaped from custody, whatever you have to."
01:32:51.107,01:32:53.150,Just use my history. They'll believe you.
01:32:53.317,01:32:55.611,"-I don't know. -Ella, listen to me."
01:32:57.446,01:32:58.823,Sometimes the hardest thing...
01:32:58.990,01:33:02.034,...is to know which bridge to cross and which to burn.
01:33:06.414,01:33:08.666,I'm the one you burn.
01:34:08.225,01:34:10.311,We've been waiting here for an hour.
01:34:10.478,01:34:14.315,"I'm sorry, Martin, but none of us have been able to reach them."
01:34:14.857,01:34:19.403,"Unfortunately, Mario and Enzo Calvini are not known for their punctuality."
01:34:19.570,01:34:21.405,They do realize this is the closing?
01:34:44.178,01:34:45.554,MAN: Mr. White...
01:34:45.721,01:34:49.225,...I've been instructed to escort you and your associates from the building.
01:34:49.392,01:34:51.477,Please gather your materials and come with me.
01:34:51.644,01:34:55.231,"-Instructed by whom? -Please, if you could just comply."
01:35:17.420,01:35:20.089,Our father never trusted these people.
01:35:21.674,01:35:24.844,Thank you for telling us the truth.
01:35:28.431,01:35:30.307,Had you not come forward...
01:35:30.474,01:35:32.893,...we would have made a terrible mistake today.
01:35:33.060,01:35:35.771,I'm just glad I could be of service.
01:35:42.069,01:35:45.781,"I don't know, Jonas. I was told nothing. I was simply thrown out."
01:35:46.198,01:35:47.992,JONAS: They know.
01:35:54.457,01:35:58.794,"Look, I can't discuss this right now. I'll call you when I'm in the air."
01:36:27.031,01:36:30.493,We're live today in the Democratic Republic of Niberia.
01:36:30.659,01:36:33.621,"As we go on air, we're getting reports that thousands of troops..."
01:36:33.787,01:36:37.541,...loyal to General Charles Motomba's Revolutionary Freedom Front...
01:36:37.708,01:36:40.336,...are moving towards the capital of Dénué.
01:36:40.503,01:36:43.422,"According to eyewitnesses, several explosions have been heard..."
01:36:43.589,01:36:47.676,...and there've been heavy outbreaks of gunfire in many parts of the city.
01:36:47.843,01:36:50.554,The people of Niberia have suffered greatly.
01:36:50.721,01:36:54.183,It is time to begin a new chapter in our country's history.
01:36:54.350,01:36:57.228,We will not stop until national liberation...
01:36:57.394,01:37:05.736,...and the restoration of nationhood-- News about Martin?
01:37:06.695,01:37:09.240,He didn't show up at his hotel or at the airport.
01:37:09.406,01:37:13.994,The Italian police have been unable to locate his car or driver.
01:37:14.161,01:37:17.873,I think Enzo and Mario Calvini are sending us a message.
01:37:18.040,01:37:20.417,How could they possibly have found out?
01:37:24.171,01:37:26.757,This is precisely what we pay you to know.
01:37:26.924,01:37:28.467,NICOLAI: We're out of time and options.
01:37:28.634,01:37:32.763,-We must make the deal with Sunay. -How can we trust this man?
01:37:32.930,01:37:36.016,The Israeli government is his biggest customer.
01:37:36.183,01:37:37.393,Why would he agree...
01:37:37.560,01:37:41.146,...to help us provide missiles to the Iranians and the Syrians...
01:37:41.313,01:37:44.108,...that have a first-strike capability against the Israelis?
01:37:44.275,01:37:46.777,I know Sunay. I believe he has every intention...
01:37:46.944,01:37:48.779,...of selling you the guidance systems...
01:37:49.196,01:37:51.407,...because he's already provided the Israelis...
01:37:51.574,01:37:54.451,...with the countermeasures to defeat them.
01:37:56.287,01:37:59.123,Would the Turk really play such a dangerous game?
01:38:00.624,01:38:02.293,We are.
01:38:03.377,01:38:05.671,The only way we can make this work...
01:38:05.838,01:38:06.880,...is to guarantee...
01:38:07.047,01:38:09.800,...that Sunay keeps this information in complete confidence.
01:38:09.967,01:38:13.971,"If our buyers find out the missiles are worthless, they'll pull all their orders..."
01:38:14.138,01:38:16.473,...and this bank will be left insolvent.
01:38:16.974,01:38:18.934,Have him here by tomorrow afternoon.
01:38:19.101,01:38:22.354,Tomorrow he's going to a funeral service for his cousin.
01:38:22.521,01:38:24.440,He'll be unavailable till Monday.
01:38:25.024,01:38:28.152,"Unless of course, you'd be willing to attend."
01:38:29.612,01:38:31.447,Make the call.
01:38:33.866,01:38:36.201,Get me Ahmet Sunay.
01:38:43.000,01:38:45.002,It's tomorrow.
01:39:26.168,01:39:28.754,It's right there. Do you want to be escorted?
01:39:28.921,01:39:30.381,"We'll be fine, thank you."
01:39:36.345,01:39:37.805,"The Sunay funeral, please."
01:39:37.971,01:39:40.307,MAN: It will be over soon. You may wait here.
01:39:40.474,01:39:42.726,WILHELM: Is there a bathroom I could use?
01:39:42.893,01:39:44.520,MAN: Just over there.
01:39:44.687,01:39:47.648,-I won't be a moment. -Right.
01:39:54.113,01:39:56.323,WILHELM: The signal? LOUIS: Good.
01:39:58.492,01:40:02.079,-Where'd you put the spike? -Inside the lapel of his jacket.
01:40:03.247,01:40:04.331,The lawyer?
01:40:05.499,01:40:07.084,White?
01:40:07.292,01:40:08.377,He's gone.
01:40:10.087,01:40:13.966,"I told you, there will always be collateral damage..."
01:40:14.133,01:40:16.427,...when you take matters into your own hands.
01:40:18.846,01:40:19.930,Your plan is working.
01:40:20.806,01:40:23.100,It has left Skarssen with only one option.
01:40:23.267,01:40:26.103,Record the conversation and you'll gain your end.
01:40:29.106,01:40:32.693,Sure they'll talk about Sunay's deal with Israel and the countermeasures?
01:40:32.860,01:40:34.236,It is the key issue.
01:40:34.403,01:40:36.363,Once you let the Iranians and Syrians...
01:40:36.530,01:40:41.118,...hear that the missiles are completely useless against the Israelis...
01:40:41.618,01:40:47.458,...they will cancel their orders and the IBBC will collapse.
01:40:56.133,01:40:58.260,-Wilhelm. -Ahmet.
01:40:58.719,01:41:00.053,It's been a long time.
01:41:00.387,01:41:01.430,AHMET: Yes.
01:41:01.597,01:41:03.474,WILHELM: My sympathies for the loss of your cousin.
01:41:03.640,01:41:04.933,AHMET: Thank you.
01:41:05.100,01:41:07.728,"Jonas Skarssen, Ahmet Sunay."
01:41:07.895,01:41:12.107,"If you'd simply come to me in the beginning, it would have been better."
01:41:14.902,01:41:16.737,Midday prayers will begin soon.
01:41:16.904,01:41:19.490,Should take a short time to settle on the broad strokes.
01:41:19.656,01:41:21.533,The rest can be sorted out at your leisure.
01:41:21.700,01:41:22.743,AHMET: We have 10 minutes.
01:41:34.838,01:41:38.175,"Wilhelm, would you mind if I spoke to Mr. Sunay alone?"
01:41:43.388,01:41:47.059,AHMET: I believe I understand the particulars of your situation.
01:41:47.226,01:41:50.103,JONAS: Perhaps we should discuss this in a more private place.
01:41:50.270,01:41:51.980,"AHMET: Yes, of course."
01:41:52.356,01:41:55.025,Allow me to show you something very special.
01:41:55.192,01:41:58.987,Something that very few outsiders know exists.
01:42:00.447,01:42:05.202,It's my understanding that the product you purchased are the XW-41s.
01:42:05.619,01:42:06.703,After you.
01:42:06.870,01:42:09.206,JONAS: Yes. Forty-two hundred units.
01:42:11.458,01:42:14.336,AHMET: What kind of guidance are they currently equipped--?
01:42:19.550,01:42:22.553,JONAS: They all need to be upgraded with VOLCON systems.
01:42:23.345,01:42:25.055,AHMET: Launch platforms?
01:42:25.222,01:42:27.808,JONAS: Ground-based vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft.
01:42:38.235,01:42:40.821,So you understand I have a terminal deadline.
01:42:40.988,01:42:42.823,"First of February, yes."
01:42:42.990,01:42:44.908,JONAS: Can you meet it? AHMET: To be sure.
01:42:45.075,01:42:48.745,"But you must arrange for the end-user certificates, transport...."
01:42:48.912,01:42:50.455,JONAS: We'll arrange for it all.
01:42:50.622,01:42:52.082,Where would the work be done?
01:42:52.249,01:42:55.168,AHMET: Cyprus. I've a facility there.
01:42:56.587,01:43:00.173,We would start retrofitting the worms within a day of their arrival.
01:43:00.340,01:43:03.427,So if you deliver them to me within the next two weeks...
01:43:03.594,01:43:05.596,...we'll meet your deadline.
01:43:18.108,01:43:21.445,I'm concerned that we limit any and all knowledge of your involvement.
01:43:22.112,01:43:25.532,AHMET: If we structure my involvement through a thick veil of shells...
01:43:26.700,01:43:28.327,...I don't foresee any complications.
01:43:33.040,01:43:36.126,AHMET: Usually we would involve our import partners from Russia.
01:43:36.501,01:43:37.961,What? I'm just a tourist.
01:43:38.128,01:43:40.797,"-Now, you must leave. -Could you get that light out of--?"
01:43:40.964,01:43:43.634,Get your fucking-- Unh!
01:43:45.761,01:43:49.306,So shall we discuss numbers?
01:43:49.681,01:43:51.433,There is a more salient deal point...
01:43:51.600,01:43:54.436,...that needs to be resolved before we can do that.
01:43:54.603,01:43:56.438,AHMET: And what point is that?
01:43:57.397,01:43:59.316,JONAS: The point of fidelity.
01:44:06.823,01:44:08.867,I know you provided the Israeli government...
01:44:09.034,01:44:11.995,...with the countermeasures to this guidance system.
01:44:20.087,01:44:22.172,Last year alone...
01:44:22.339,01:44:25.968,...I did more than 300 million in business with the Israelis.
01:44:29.638,01:44:31.974,I would never put that at risk.
01:44:32.140,01:44:36.353,How can I trust you not to divulge this information to anyone else?
01:44:37.312,01:44:39.856,"It's mutual interest, not trust..."
01:44:40.273,01:44:42.943,...that will be the bond of our relationship.
01:44:46.697,01:44:49.533,Your compensation will be held in an escrow account.
01:44:50.742,01:44:52.995,--released until our clients pay in full.
01:44:53.662,01:44:55.038,And those are the terms.
01:44:57.749,01:45:04.131,The payout structure-- The transfers will be begun by tomorrow morning.
01:45:04.297,01:45:07.843,Ehames will contact you with the number for the escrow account.
01:45:13.098,01:45:16.143,So ends the bloody business of the day.
01:45:28.822,01:45:31.366,JONAS: We're closed. I need you and Ehames here tomorrow...
01:45:31.533,01:45:34.119,...to work out all the details with Sunay's people.
01:45:34.494,01:45:37.247,Yes. We're on our way home.
01:45:45.088,01:45:46.089,Wilhelm?
01:45:49.092,01:45:50.510,Wake up.
01:48:51.524,01:48:52.567,Who are you?
01:48:54.778,01:48:56.571,I'm Louis Salinger.
01:49:06.498,01:49:09.251,You don't have the authority to arrest me.
01:49:11.461,01:49:14.214,Who said anything about arresting you?
01:49:18.510,01:49:22.305,-What do you want? -I want some fucking justice.

01:49:26.351,01:49:28.895,There will be 100 other bankers to take my place.
01:49:29.062,01:49:32.107,Everything will continue.
01:49:32.274,01:49:38.238,The only thing you'll succeed in doing is to satisfy your own blood lust.
01:49:43.159,01:49:44.619,And you know it.
