00:01:29.166,00:01:32.541,"Sugo, keep your eyes and ears open!"
00:01:33.208,00:01:34.875,It's frightening the girls.
00:01:37.875,00:01:39.875,…if you hadn't gotten lost.
00:01:39.958,00:01:42.625,"Really, Papa, you grew up in Kaedwen."
00:01:48.333,00:01:50.583,Are bandits killing innocents along these trails?
00:02:11.083,00:02:12.000,No!
00:03:03.500,00:03:05.666,You must make a killing at druid festivals.
00:03:06.208,00:03:08.541,Don't usually see your sorts around these parts.
00:03:16.458,00:03:19.416,"You're a trailblazer, flaunting the new fad."
00:03:19.500,00:03:20.708,"Trendsetter, you."
00:03:23.583,00:03:26.333,"Whoa, there. People should get acquainted more, really."
00:03:29.708,00:03:31.500,Especially when one's about to kill the other.
00:03:32.583,00:03:35.750,"Though you leshens don't speak, so there's the rub."
00:04:15.041,00:04:16.125,…and stick with it.
00:04:20.291,00:04:22.125,"Deadly, flapping swarm it is."
00:04:37.208,00:04:39.041,Away. It's not dead.
00:04:39.125,00:04:41.500,So kill it. You're a witcher.
00:04:41.583,00:04:43.750,There are several ways to kill a leshen.
00:04:43.833,00:04:48.875,"Behead it, sacrifice a few of its furry pets, even a few old dryad spells will do."
00:04:49.750,00:05:17.958,Which will you… Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath.
00:05:20.333,00:05:22.708,Thought you said they don't speak?
00:05:28.916,00:05:29.958,They don't.
00:05:49.166,00:05:50.000,Wait!
00:05:50.083,00:05:52.083,Wait. I'm noble blood.
00:05:52.166,00:05:53.583,You can't leave me here.
00:05:54.166,00:05:55.208,What am I to do?
00:05:59.791,00:06:05.375,"He said, Practice your sad face, and maybe a passerby will offer you a ride."
00:06:09.208,00:06:12.583,The witcher said to use my sad face on the alderman too.
00:06:13.208,00:06:16.916,So he'd spare some men to… gather the bodies.
00:06:24.375,00:06:25.541,"Dry eyes, child."
00:06:26.791,00:06:31.083,I'll see that your father and sisters are returned to you and laid to rest properly.
00:06:35.916,00:06:37.708,and a loyal subject to our king.
00:06:37.791,00:06:40.750,My students and I resubmit our petition.
00:06:41.333,00:06:47.291,Seize the witcher home of Kaer Morhen and exile its occupants for crimes against Kaedwen's people.
00:06:47.791,00:06:54.791,"From what the boy told us, Your Highness, the witcher slew the leshen that was terrorizing our forests."
00:06:54.875,00:07:00.666,"Lady Zerbst, since when have leshens prowled about Kaedwen, never mind with such hostility?"
00:07:01.333,00:07:02.458,Eh?
00:07:02.541,00:07:07.083,"Oh, you're suggesting the witchers have been staging these forest attacks."
00:07:07.166,00:07:10.458,"So scandalous, Madam Gilcrest."
00:07:10.541,00:07:13.666,Monster species have dwindled under their swords.
00:07:15.791,00:07:18.750,"Some have turned to mercenary work, others criminality."
00:07:18.833,00:07:21.916,One even took a bounty on a cheating husband's head.
00:07:22.000,00:07:24.583,And you have evidence to prove your conspiracy?
00:07:24.666,00:07:29.041,Or are we to merely bank on your magical intuition?
00:07:29.125,00:07:31.083,"It's their natures, my lady."
00:07:32.583,00:07:35.375,Witchers are the offspring of foul sorcery.
00:07:35.875,00:07:41.625,"Roaming our lands, voting themselves the stalkers of evil, extorting coin from the gullible."
00:07:42.125,00:07:46.791,"Honest, simple peasants who ascribe all misfortune to spells and monsters."
00:07:46.875,00:07:48.833,Mages create the witcher.
00:07:48.916,00:07:52.583,Then presume it's our duty to hold the bucket and mop up their brown mess.
00:07:57.333,00:07:59.458,I'm with Lady Zerbst on this one.
00:07:59.958,00:08:02.041,The witchers remain at Kaer Morhen.
00:08:02.125,00:08:08.000,At least until such time as evidence is provided that supports your theory.
00:08:26.875,00:08:32.458,"When a witcher inflicts pain, he experiences ecstasy."
00:08:35.708,00:08:38.916,A dead elven dialect linked to darker times.
00:08:39.000,00:08:41.416,Few remember the ancient tongue. Fewer dare speak it.
00:08:42.333,00:08:48.583,But how a leshen would know it or be afraid of some den-- Never said it was afraid.
00:08:49.333,00:08:51.625,"You speak Ellyon, don't you, Filavandrel?"
00:08:52.375,00:08:54.625,You witchers are desperate for coin.
00:08:55.208,00:08:57.666,Turning to elves for leads on work.
00:08:58.833,00:09:03.041,These pleasures do not pay for themselves. What did the leshen say?
00:09:03.708,00:09:05.541,Beware the den of my dead.
00:09:05.625,00:09:08.500,Hmm. Things you don't wish to hear in a bath.
00:09:09.875,00:09:12.750,Did you notice anything else unusual?
00:09:13.250,00:09:15.000,There was an energy in the woods.
00:09:15.750,00:09:17.375,"Some sort of magic, maybe."
00:09:17.458,00:09:19.416,"Controlling the leshen, bewitching it."
00:09:20.166,00:09:21.208,What's your face?
00:09:22.416,00:09:26.916,"Over the last four summers, girls have been disappearing from our ranks."
00:09:27.000,00:09:29.041,"Oh, God, no elf drama."
00:09:33.750,00:09:38.250,"-But the disappearances haven't stopped. -Tragic, really. Very terrible."
00:09:38.333,00:09:41.583,"One of the first to vanish was a young mage, Kitsu."
00:09:42.750,00:09:45.875,She spoke Ellyon. We should return to these forests.
00:09:46.708,00:09:51.958,"See, I'm a monster hunter, Fil, not an elf wrangler, not even the murderous ones, but good luck."
00:09:57.458,00:09:58.666,Quite the opposite.
00:10:01.125,00:10:04.916,I have a reputation and a healthy estimation of my talent's worth.
00:10:05.875,00:10:10.166,My apologies for trying to save you from a wasted winter at Kaer Morhen.
00:10:13.041,00:10:15.791,"Well, there's drinking, eating, sleeping."
00:10:16.291,00:10:17.166,All free.
00:10:22.000,00:10:23.500,I leave that to my peers.
00:10:25.083,00:10:30.708,Imagine if you witchers labored for more than just thrill and coin.
00:10:31.458,00:10:59.791,Imagine if you elves wielded your swords Licking. Ooh! They're licking.
00:11:06.375,00:11:08.416,"I told you, double knots!"
00:11:10.708,00:11:13.166,Let's see if the boy can handle fetching a wet cloth.
00:11:16.041,00:11:18.750,A lesser man would sell your boy to another family.
00:11:19.916,00:11:24.000,At least my son proves a measure of your generous character.
00:11:24.083,00:11:27.458,Head to the market. We will need blue gum to sedate our lady.
00:11:31.541,00:11:33.583,Please stop! Please make it stop!
00:11:43.625,00:11:45.666,Stop fidgeting!
00:12:01.166,00:12:02.125,Oh!
00:12:05.583,00:12:08.708,Poor Illyana. I didn't even have to take a shot.
00:12:08.791,00:12:11.625,Moron! You could've killed me.
00:12:12.541,00:12:13.625,Here to bother me?
00:12:13.708,00:12:16.250,The Lord insisted I look after you in the market.
00:12:16.333,00:12:18.291,Seemed rather pissed.
00:12:19.875,00:12:26.291,"We slave away all day long, getting shout at, and the only coin we get is when we're sent to fetch them goods."
00:12:26.375,00:12:29.958,Just be happy you have a roof over your head and your belly's not empty.
00:12:30.041,00:12:34.541,"Barely a roof, barely not empty. Just enough to keep us here breathing."
00:12:37.333,00:12:38.625,There's the world.
00:12:38.708,00:12:41.083,What would you buy if you had all its coin?
00:12:41.166,00:12:44.125,I would get the hell out of this village and travel the continent.
00:12:44.208,00:12:45.958,-Adventure? -Of course.
00:12:46.041,00:12:47.791,"-Glory? -Oh, yes!"
00:12:47.875,00:12:48.833,Girls?
00:12:51.500,00:12:53.833,I'd buy a gorgeous lake house.
00:12:54.333,00:13:01.333,My handsome husband and I would picnic and drink wine by the water as our children played jacks nearby.
00:13:01.416,00:13:03.500,You know what we should do?
00:13:04.166,00:13:06.500,We should take this coin and buy honey cake.
00:13:06.583,00:13:08.750,And how will our lady get her herbs?
00:13:14.416,00:13:16.166,Stop! Thief!
00:13:19.291,00:13:20.333,This way!
00:13:53.041,00:13:54.125,Mmm!
00:13:55.166,00:13:56.750,Save some for me!
00:14:00.750,00:14:01.916,I knew it would.
00:14:10.250,00:14:12.958,they'd cut your thieving hands right off.
00:14:14.000,00:14:16.625,Make you wear 'em round your neck for weeks.
00:14:17.958,00:14:19.333,Smart trick.
00:14:20.166,00:14:21.583,Odd loot.
00:14:21.666,00:14:22.833,Who you got who's sick?
00:14:26.000,00:14:31.333,Where… Where'd a girl find balls like that in an alley wi' a man like me?
00:14:31.416,00:14:35.500,I steal them from smelly cowards who try to bully young ladies.
00:14:39.333,00:14:40.333,Who are you?
00:14:40.416,00:14:50.708,"A humanitarian, whose well-meaning ears have heard of a local lady …seeing horrors that aren't really there."
00:14:51.208,00:14:57.250,"That blue gum will certainly ease the affliction, but, uh… a sword would kill it."
00:14:57.333,00:14:58.375,Name's Deglan.
00:14:59.083,00:15:01.333,And you're gonna take me to your noblewoman.
00:15:01.833,00:15:04.958,Or I'm taking you two pests back to the market.
00:15:14.083,00:15:15.000,A mahr.
00:15:15.500,00:15:19.208,Puts you down with horrid delusions and feeds off your madness.
00:15:19.291,00:15:23.833,"Meteorite ore disrupts the demon's magic, so it can be… removed."
00:15:24.333,00:15:25.958,Out. Now. All of you.
00:15:28.250,00:15:29.416,I'd like to remain.
00:15:30.625,00:15:34.041,"Your boy's likely seen a monster or two in his time, no?"
00:15:43.166,00:15:46.583,But I thought a witcher slays monsters?
00:15:48.458,00:15:50.416,you've first got to understand it.
00:15:52.458,00:15:53.958,Find its weakness.
00:15:54.500,00:15:56.750,I want this sucker alive and kicking.
00:15:57.875,00:15:58.750,If possible.
00:16:09.708,00:16:10.791,"Steady, young fella."
00:16:10.875,00:16:36.708,Uh… And he asked to stay.
00:17:01.666,00:17:03.125,Better dead than fled.
00:17:06.875,00:17:09.041,There'll always be another monster.
00:17:15.500,00:17:17.000,Fetch warm water.
00:17:17.708,00:17:21.291,"My head… Oh, my head hurts wildly."
00:17:34.541,00:17:36.000,"Nice weight, isn't it?"
00:17:36.083,00:17:39.291,How much you suppose the job cost that prick master of yours?
00:17:40.875,00:17:43.083,Fear and ignorance are good business.
00:17:44.416,00:17:46.000,"For your service, young fella."
00:17:54.416,00:17:55.500,Take me with you.
00:17:56.666,00:17:58.666,Not many boys seek to be witchers.
00:17:58.750,00:18:02.083,Even fewer seek a life of fetching bedpans and water.
00:18:02.166,00:18:03.000,And the girl?
00:18:04.000,00:18:05.291,Your blue-eyed lass?
00:18:06.583,00:18:09.333,You hesitated back with the mahr too.
00:18:09.416,00:18:13.000,Witchers do not hesitate.
00:18:40.916,00:18:43.250,-Stop! -Are you going to enjoy the day?
00:18:43.333,00:18:47.083,Or are you still too shook from your daring night of monster-slaying?
00:18:47.166,00:18:49.166,"It was your first time, Vesemir."
00:18:49.750,00:18:53.208,Excuse me for wanting to be good at something other than serving.
00:18:53.291,00:18:55.541,"Oh, I can see it now."
00:18:55.625,00:19:03.541,"You, adorned in battle armor, steel and silver swords, saving the continent from kikamores, ghouls, and mad sorcerers."
00:19:03.625,00:19:05.291,Evil would tremble.
00:19:06.500,00:19:09.916,"-Stylish armor, by the way. -Imagine it however you like."
00:19:10.666,00:19:14.416,Only way people like us survive is to dream of ourselves as something else.
00:19:15.000,00:19:19.291,Who knows? Perhaps someday I'll be a princess who commands the snow.
00:19:22.333,00:19:23.333,Uh!
00:19:25.708,00:19:27.875,"Vesemir, I was only jesting."
00:19:27.958,00:19:29.458,You find our fates funny?
00:19:30.083,00:19:34.250,Why should I be meek and penniless like my father? Or you like your mother?
00:19:34.875,00:19:37.750,-What's got you so silly? -You wouldn't understand.
00:19:37.833,00:19:40.125,"Vesemir, out there, we're nothing."
00:19:40.791,00:19:41.916,Less than nothing.
00:19:42.458,00:19:45.000,"At least here, at the estate, we have station."
00:19:45.083,00:19:46.750,And if I could take care of you?
00:19:47.333,00:19:51.416,"The coin that witcher made last night, you should've saw it."
00:19:51.916,00:19:54.791,"I'd get you your lake house, all your wine."
00:19:54.875,00:19:57.416,Anything and everything.
00:19:57.500,00:19:58.458,Yours.
00:19:59.416,00:20:04.083,So trade my debt to a master I hate with a debt to one that I love?
00:20:06.666,00:20:08.708,"Wait, Illyana! Stay!"
00:20:09.208,00:20:10.333,You stay.
00:21:42.291,00:21:45.291,"Lord Vesemir, my new best friend."
00:21:45.375,00:21:47.416,Crossed a leshen on my way here.
00:21:47.500,00:21:48.416,So we've heard.
00:21:49.000,00:21:53.791,"Meanwhile, I barely made enough this year to score a night with a limp-pricked man-whore."
00:21:53.875,00:21:55.541,"Your woes break me, Luka."
00:21:59.125,00:22:03.416,Bad enough we're putting ourselves out of business with every monster we kill.
00:22:03.500,00:22:05.708,Now there'll be even more of us.
00:22:09.833,00:22:12.166,"Also, short a man-whore?"
00:22:12.708,00:22:14.125,Go fuck yourself.
00:22:14.208,00:22:15.916,Aren't you short everything?
00:22:16.000,00:22:22.208,"Boys, monsters will fuck through the winter, then come spring, there'll be jobs from here to Nazair."
00:22:22.291,00:22:30.041,"Until then, I say we perk up, drink up, and you two focus on breaking these brats into the world of witchering."
00:22:36.583,00:22:39.666,"True diabolical creatures, fit only for killing."
00:22:41.416,00:22:44.250,There is no place amidst honest men for them.
00:22:45.250,00:22:47.750,"My, my. How do you find this rubbish?"
00:22:47.833,00:22:51.583,A few of the boys spotted 'em posted about towns on their way back.
00:22:51.666,00:22:54.500,Tetra Gilcrest. Sounds like a botanist.
00:22:56.666,00:23:00.583,Rambles about being a descendant of the first human mage.
00:23:00.666,00:23:03.166,Would it have vexed you to bury that lad's sisters?
00:23:04.208,00:23:06.833,You're feeding fodder to arses like Gilcrest.
00:23:08.125,00:23:10.166,"That's a wyvern tooth, not a basilisk."
00:23:10.250,00:23:11.958,I'll mix and match as I please.
00:23:14.125,00:23:17.125,"-You know me and children. -Get over it, young fella."
00:23:17.208,00:23:19.583,'Cause you're teaching fencing to the recruits.
00:23:23.958,00:23:28.083,Wimps found employ in other more lucrative nonsense.
00:23:28.583,00:23:30.791,So we'll all be slogging more weight.
00:23:30.875,00:23:34.125,A wonderful winter of abandoned little tragedies.
00:23:34.208,00:23:35.041,Lovely.
00:23:38.500,00:23:40.875,Tell me you've considered the thing was bewitched.
00:23:43.000,00:23:45.333,A croon could pull that feat.
00:23:45.416,00:23:47.416,"A higher vampire, definitely."
00:23:48.208,00:23:51.083,Or it could be a new breed of leshen.
00:23:51.166,00:23:54.875,"Actually, just elves airing their usual dirty trousers of victimhood."
00:23:58.166,00:24:01.250,A few new beasts would be… good for business.
00:24:27.500,00:24:30.291,A witcher would need proof to collect his coin.
00:24:30.958,00:24:36.958,"And yet… At least help me persuade the king to send an envoy to Kaer Morhen to investigate, please."
00:24:37.791,00:24:41.458,Your acolytes have played to people's fears well enough.
00:24:41.541,00:24:45.916,"The mere act of sending an envoy would indict the witchers, whatever the truth."
00:24:46.708,00:24:48.875,Do you know what's involved in making a witcher?
00:24:50.041,00:24:52.125,The horrors done to their recruits?
00:24:55.916,00:24:58.416,Your late husband would've understood this.
00:24:58.916,00:25:01.250,I was an ardent admirer of Lord Zerbst.
00:25:02.666,00:25:04.000,He was open-minded.
00:25:04.791,00:25:05.791,Forward-thinking.
00:25:06.541,00:25:08.291,"Married you, after all."
00:25:08.375,00:25:10.541,"Careful, Tetra."
00:25:11.041,00:25:12.291,Or be quiet.
00:25:12.875,00:25:16.083,Kaedwen's laws grant a widow her husband's seat at court.
00:25:16.166,00:25:18.791,The laws say nothing about erasing what she once was.
00:25:19.791,00:25:24.208,"Well, how fortunate, my lady, that few have wished to press the issue."
00:25:42.791,00:25:44.458,You ain't fed us in days!
00:25:44.541,00:25:47.208,"We ain't given sleep, can barely stand up."
00:25:47.708,00:25:49.833,Now you got us playing with swords?
00:25:51.041,00:25:53.958,I don't wish to be here any more than you do.
00:25:54.833,00:25:56.041,I'll hazard a guess.
00:25:56.125,00:25:59.583,You all imagine there are better fates for you out there in the world.
00:26:00.541,00:26:02.666,"But out there, you have nothing."
00:26:03.875,00:26:05.916,"But here, we offer strength."
00:26:09.750,00:26:10.625,Respect.
00:26:11.125,00:26:13.958,A chance at surviving the very horrors waiting out there.
00:26:14.458,00:26:21.541,"If you don't want that, then this… is wasted on you."
00:26:27.166,00:26:29.000,then this is wasted on ya.
00:26:29.083,00:26:31.666,Ugh. That dorbel's full of shit.
00:26:31.750,00:26:34.000,Master Deglan's preparing us for the Path.
00:26:37.625,00:26:39.416,"Oh, there's a freeze tonight."
00:26:42.333,00:26:44.291,Shut up and steal what sleep you can.
00:26:46.291,00:26:48.583,"Ah, don't mind Tomas."
00:26:48.666,00:26:49.958,Law of Surprise.
00:26:50.041,00:26:52.875,Didn't know he belonged to the witchers till one came knocking.
00:26:52.958,00:26:54.125,Law of Surprise?
00:27:04.083,00:27:06.416,Who chooses to be in this pigsty?
00:27:09.833,00:27:15.000,-Don't be so scared. -They're… -They're going to poison us. -Who?
00:27:17.333,00:27:18.250,Old ones.
00:27:18.833,00:27:24.750,"Making witchers, they… They'll kill us. Then bring us back, but… we won't be normal."
00:27:26.041,00:27:29.000,-They call it-- -The Trial of the Grasses. I know.
00:27:29.083,00:27:30.416,I get scared too.
00:27:31.291,00:27:36.666,"Then I think, Soon, I'll be out on the Path, stronger than most anyone, wanting for nothing."
00:27:37.208,00:27:38.541,I'll never be scared again.
00:27:40.958,00:27:43.833,"You'll come out the Trials better than normal, Tomas."
00:27:44.708,00:27:45.708,On my word.
00:28:11.083,00:28:14.041,Quiet. My pa used to talk about this place.
00:28:14.833,00:28:16.333,It's the Red Swamp.
00:28:16.416,00:28:17.625,It's cursed.
00:28:17.708,00:28:20.666,It's crawling with evil spirits and beasts.
00:28:21.250,00:28:22.333,Griffins.
00:28:22.416,00:28:23.875,This is a test.
00:28:24.500,00:28:25.708,Like all the others.
00:28:25.791,00:28:29.500,"On the Path, a witcher's first instinct is to survive."
00:28:30.083,00:28:32.083,"It's about wits, not swords."
00:28:32.166,00:28:34.458,We follow the moon until we're clear.
00:28:34.541,00:28:52.708,"If there's a monster close, your medallion will-- Stay together!"
00:29:34.750,00:29:35.750,This way.
00:30:06.291,00:31:43.916,Uh… Oh… The medallions sometimes sense the bestiary.
00:31:48.250,00:31:50.625,The mages Tomas mentioned who make witchers.
00:31:51.666,00:31:53.041,You don't look ancient.
00:31:53.625,00:31:55.708,"Well, mages age quite slowly."
00:31:55.791,00:31:56.916,Witchers do too.
00:31:57.000,00:32:00.541,Gives us both decades to hone our respective skills.
00:32:00.625,00:32:05.500,The Trials are only part Don't fear.
00:32:05.583,00:32:08.916,It's merely a side effect of its hybrid genes.
00:32:10.833,00:32:14.208,I've identified three different species in this specimen's makeup.
00:32:16.708,00:32:20.458,Master Deglan said monsters can't mate with other species.
00:32:20.958,00:32:24.291,True. Though they can be engineered.
00:32:24.916,00:32:33.125,Imagine an army of beasts designed to wipe out the elves and the Old Races to secure land and food.
00:32:33.708,00:32:36.583,"The alchemy was… inelegant, though."
00:32:37.250,00:32:39.708,Most crossbreeds died instantly.
00:32:42.541,00:32:44.666,then made witchers to kill them?
00:32:48.541,00:32:53.166,"to such mutagenic alchemy, preventing further abuse."
00:32:53.833,00:32:55.375,"I'm Reidrich, by the way."
00:32:57.750,00:33:01.541,A witcher deserves to understand its place in history.
00:33:02.291,00:33:04.500,A rider came while you were licking your wounds.
00:33:04.583,00:33:05.833,Left a letter for ya.
00:33:05.916,00:33:09.125,Did you know that Tomas and the others would die in the swamp?
00:33:09.208,00:33:11.375,"It's a numbers game, young fella."
00:33:14.458,00:33:17.041,Depends. How many are witchers?
00:33:18.750,00:33:21.750,"Letter's by your cot. Read it now, before I burn it."
00:33:31.083,00:33:34.166,"Your thoughts are likely far from here, so I will be brief."
00:33:35.083,00:33:36.416,Your father is dead.
00:33:37.125,00:33:48.416,"Kaedwen took our village and he was killed while helping the lord and lady escape, if this were ever that to you."
00:33:49.458,00:33:56.958,"I hope you have found warmth and comfort in this brittle world and that the world is being kind to you, and most of all, fair."
00:33:57.875,00:34:02.041,"For me, a noble family from Kaedwen has claimed me theirs."
00:34:03.125,00:34:04.791,They are kinder masters.
00:34:05.291,00:34:09.000,"They let me paint and show me how to read words, as well as write a few."
00:34:10.041,00:34:12.000,I am well-fed and at peace.
00:34:14.375,00:34:23.500,"There was little to miss in our burnt-out town, and our snowball fights and alleyway desserts are heavy memories I now happily lay to rest."
00:34:27.291,00:34:29.375,free of past burdens and hurts.
00:34:30.208,00:34:33.500,"And yes, free of me."
00:34:34.500,00:34:35.833,It is best that way.
00:34:37.333,00:34:38.583,Live and love well.
00:34:39.541,00:34:40.458,Illyana.
00:35:53.791,00:35:57.916,"Right. So, who wishes to ride and get blitzed somewhere nice and quiet?"
00:36:03.750,00:36:06.833,"It'll be Eskel, Lambert, maybe Remus."
00:36:07.416,00:36:10.708,"Now, can we please go get right properly drunk?"
00:36:12.916,00:36:13.916,We'll drink.
00:36:18.166,00:36:21.458,The midwife almost fainted when I came for my payment.
00:36:25.041,00:36:27.708,"but, you know, that's the job."
00:36:32.666,00:36:35.041,We need more before the next tale.
00:36:36.625,00:36:39.833,"You know, that midwife should've hired a better savior."
00:36:39.916,00:36:41.458,A man of virtue and honor.
00:36:42.041,00:36:43.125,A real man.
00:36:43.208,00:36:44.833,Not a mutant.
00:36:44.916,00:36:47.583,Are knights being schooled in striga curses now?
00:36:48.208,00:36:51.500,Where'd that lesson fit? Between learning curtsy and joust?
00:36:51.583,00:36:55.041,We're all here for a little drink and non-violent fun.
00:36:56.833,00:36:57.958,Ugh.
00:36:58.041,00:37:00.916,Is this the your kind bit?
00:37:01.958,00:37:03.583,You frighten these people.
00:37:04.083,00:37:06.625,As you frightened that midwife you swindled.
00:37:07.208,00:37:08.666,Best you leave.
00:37:08.750,00:37:11.083,Right now.
00:37:11.166,00:37:13.541,I've seen knights try to do our job.
00:37:14.125,00:37:15.833,Tidy up monsters.
00:37:15.916,00:37:18.083,"Cautionary tales, all of you."
00:37:19.208,00:37:20.708,Especially the cute ones.
00:37:23.833,00:37:28.000,The two witchers should be tried and executed. No questions asked.
00:37:29.708,00:37:33.791,Here I thought trials were all about questions.
00:37:33.875,00:37:37.333,"These two killed two of your guard, Your Highness. You'd let that stand?"
00:37:41.833,00:37:44.583,These witchers were defending themselves.
00:37:45.291,00:37:49.375,The people's faith in the monarchy already wavers due to the forest attacks.
00:37:49.458,00:37:53.083,Now they'll hear the crown waxed idly as two monsters shed knighted blood.
00:37:53.166,00:37:55.083,So we should go to war with the witchers?
00:37:55.166,00:37:57.833,If only so you can make them what you fear?
00:37:58.750,00:38:01.250,"They are deadly. On that, we agree, Tetra."
00:38:01.875,00:38:04.750,And such a battle would flood Kaedwen red.
00:38:11.750,00:38:15.083,Earned by her body. Not by blood or title.
00:38:18.375,00:38:21.500,I'll have my knights kill you both for the sake of my ears.
00:38:21.583,00:38:24.166,"Tetra's right, actually, sire."
00:38:24.916,00:38:27.375,Your subjects expect action.
00:38:27.458,00:38:30.583,What if you act on two fronts with one move?
00:38:30.666,00:38:34.625,Clear out our forests while also avoiding war with the witchers?
00:38:44.041,00:38:45.250,Aye?
00:38:46.166,00:38:47.333,Do you hear that?
00:38:47.416,00:38:49.666,-It's like this pinging noise. -Hey!
00:38:50.416,00:38:53.333,"Are you eager for a beating, mutant?"
00:38:53.416,00:38:56.875,"I'd settle for a pot to piss in and some halfway decent bread, please."
00:38:59.000,00:38:59.833,Oof!
00:39:01.958,00:39:15.375,"Ah. A bit generous, but… Not like when we were younger."
00:39:16.500,00:39:21.041,"I knew witchers aged differently, but, well, look at you!"
00:39:22.500,00:39:23.541,Illyana!
00:39:23.625,00:39:27.333,"No doubt you imagined me an old spinster by now, slaving away."
00:39:28.083,00:39:30.333,That is if you ever imagine me at all.
00:39:30.416,00:39:31.625,Uh… your letter.
00:39:32.750,00:39:35.125,-You'd been sold to a new estate. -Yes.
00:39:35.791,00:39:37.333,The Zerbsts of Kaedwen.
00:39:37.416,00:39:43.000,"They were kind enough, but it… it was their son who was truly fond of me, despite my station."
00:39:47.166,00:39:50.583,"Lake house? Oh, my, the lake house!"
00:39:50.666,00:39:52.375,"No lake, no."
00:39:53.166,00:39:54.250,But a nice home.
00:39:54.833,00:39:57.750,Turned it into an orphanage after my husband passed.
00:39:57.833,00:40:00.208,We had children too. Girls.
00:40:00.291,00:40:02.500,"Horrors, all three of them."
00:40:02.583,00:40:05.041,One just made me a grandmother. I begged her not to.
00:40:07.583,00:40:11.375,"They often remind me of you-- Oh, gods."
00:40:11.875,00:40:13.750,I'm… rambling.
00:40:14.250,00:40:15.166,You're bored.
00:40:15.250,00:40:16.958,"No, no, no. You're fine."
00:40:17.041,00:40:20.291,"You're good. Uh… this is unexpected, yes."
00:40:20.791,00:40:23.708,"Little fresh. But, uh… also lovely."
00:40:24.208,00:40:30.208,You've had such a full-- You wish to kill my already-dead husband and burn the orphanage to the ground.
00:40:31.166,00:40:33.333,Not the precise words I'd use.
00:40:36.583,00:40:38.750,Lord Zerbst was kind to me.
00:40:39.708,00:40:46.125,"By no means perfect, but… he's someone you miss very much when they depart."
00:40:48.416,00:40:50.750,"The tales I've heard of you, though."
00:40:51.250,00:40:54.166,The swashbuckling witcher for hire.
00:40:54.250,00:40:59.333,"The slayer Vesemir, priced only for the foulest of creatures."
00:40:59.416,00:41:03.375,"Well, not too long ago, you were stuffing my head full of those very notions."
00:41:04.291,00:41:06.750,Years do work differently for you.
00:41:12.750,00:41:16.791,The king is willing to grant you and your friend amnesty for your crimes.
00:41:16.875,00:41:23.666,"Then you are reminded that I carry the duties of my late husband, the noble Lord Zerbst, adviser to the throne."
00:41:23.750,00:41:26.000,Every deal has a price.
00:41:26.083,00:41:29.833,Kill whatever is murdering our people in the woods outside Ard Carraigh.
00:41:29.916,00:41:31.333,"And my colleague, Luka?"
00:41:31.416,00:41:33.958,-He'll have my care. -Reasonable terms.
00:41:34.541,00:41:36.333,You'll take a chaperone too.
00:41:36.416,00:41:40.000,"That, there, well… that's a problem."
00:41:40.541,00:41:45.500,"The Path's quite perilous, and you are a lady, my lady."
00:41:46.333,00:41:51.833,"Also, can't have a noble such as you seen slumming about with the mutant likes of me."
00:41:52.416,00:41:56.000,Then you'll no doubt be pleased to hear that I am not your chaperone.
00:42:02.166,00:42:05.291,"I have no intention of playing guide or nurse to you, witch."
00:42:05.375,00:42:07.416,I don't care who your great-great-whoever was.
00:42:12.791,00:42:16.083,"On my word, I will slay this beast."
00:42:16.166,00:42:17.416,"For you, Illyana."
00:42:32.500,00:42:35.625,The leshen that killed your man Carlisle was bewitched.
00:42:35.708,00:42:36.958,By an elf.
00:42:39.583,00:42:46.041,"See, another very old but very young-looking elf asked me to help him to find a group of misplaced girls."
00:42:47.208,00:42:50.166,"Point is, witchering is a business."
00:42:50.250,00:42:51.583,You have to keep a brand.
00:42:51.666,00:42:56.166,Can't score the big jobs if you're known for swatting nymphs and helping out elves.
00:42:58.250,00:43:00.708,Isn't fire magic forbidden by upstanding mages?
00:43:01.750,00:43:06.208,Only insofar as there are very few mages blessed with the skill to control the flames.
00:43:13.125,00:43:14.625,I must seem silly to you.
00:43:15.416,00:43:20.208,"But Chaos, it's… Well, words fail description."
00:43:21.833,00:43:24.125,Witchers are connected to Chaos too.
00:43:24.208,00:43:27.208,Only your connection is corrupted and corrosive.
00:43:27.291,00:43:28.416,And far less condemning.
00:43:32.291,00:43:36.166,There's a story about a witcher who helped an ailing priest.
00:43:36.708,00:43:43.833,"The monster-slayer believed the sickness was, in fact, a curse, and could be lifted by killing whoever placed it."
00:43:44.333,00:43:49.375,"The priest quickly fingered a local sorceress, a stupid girl who always caused him trouble."
00:43:50.291,00:43:54.166,"The witcher killed her, and was rightly paid in gems and jewels."
00:43:55.958,00:43:58.833,-The priest obviously got better. -He did.
00:43:59.416,00:44:08.166,"And then a few days later, he found a beautiful gem amid his cook's belongings, identical to the one he'd given the clever witcher."
00:44:08.250,00:44:10.666,Ah. He had the cook poison the priest's meals.
00:44:10.750,00:44:12.333,Cut him in on the take.
00:44:15.875,00:44:18.541,As I said… corrupted.
00:44:30.000,00:44:30.875,"Ah, lovely."
00:44:31.500,00:44:33.166,-You've led us in a circle. -No.
00:44:33.750,00:44:35.416,I know these forests.
00:44:35.500,00:44:37.458,Hmm. So did Lord Carlisle.
00:44:37.541,00:44:41.958,"At Aretuza, we used magic to cast pleasant illusions around unpleasant foods."
00:44:42.041,00:44:46.041,"Made food tastier, yet the aftertaste of the illusion?"
00:44:48.208,00:44:49.041,Bitter.
00:44:51.333,00:44:56.458,Chaos clear our hearts and minds. Let our eyes see right and true.
00:44:57.125,00:44:59.166,Lift the shroud that cloaks our mind.
00:45:16.125,00:45:18.458,That illusion was flawless.
00:45:19.166,00:45:37.500,The power needed to maintain such art… Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath.
00:45:37.583,00:45:39.625,-Kitsu? -Friend of yours?
00:45:39.708,00:45:40.958,Friend of a friend.
00:45:41.041,00:45:44.000,Garean bhaedh aip me vhoelynath!
00:45:44.083,00:45:52.166,"Yes. I'll need to know what and where your den is if I'm to avoid it, especially since you're, you know, -slaughtering people over it. -Witcher."
00:45:56.708,00:45:58.916,I've never seen such a species of basilisk.
00:45:59.416,00:46:01.875,-Another illusion? -We'll no doubt find out shortly.
00:46:34.958,00:46:37.750,I know. She has that effect on everyone.
00:46:37.833,00:46:39.541,"But still, manners."
00:47:55.083,00:47:57.791,-It was real. -Might have slightly underestimated you.
00:47:58.291,00:47:59.416,Slightly.
00:48:02.500,00:48:04.708,"Kitsu, this needn't escalate."
00:48:11.791,00:48:19.916,Uh… Oh!
00:48:34.375,00:48:35.541,Witcher!
00:48:59.583,00:49:02.291,Her powers of illusion are unnatural.
00:49:02.375,00:49:04.750,First monster I ever encountered was a mahr.
00:49:04.833,00:49:08.458,Made a woman see nightmares that weren't really there. Illusions.
00:49:08.541,00:49:11.875,-Kitsu's an elf. -Then why does she smell like a mahr?
00:49:21.625,00:49:24.291,They used to send their young here during high summer.
00:49:24.958,00:49:29.041,Before repurposing it as a garrison during your last cleansing spree.
00:49:31.666,00:49:32.916,No signs of blood.
00:49:34.625,00:49:36.375,"I can still smell her, though."
00:49:37.041,00:49:37.875,Yes.
00:49:38.375,00:49:39.375,She was here.
00:49:40.250,00:49:41.583,Just before our fight.
00:50:19.541,00:50:20.416,Witcher!
00:50:21.166,00:50:22.666,"I do have a name, you know."
00:50:28.416,00:50:29.875,What was done to them?
00:50:34.000,00:50:35.000,Girls.
00:50:36.583,00:50:37.416,Help.
00:50:48.458,00:50:50.500,"Gods, not another favor."
00:50:52.333,00:50:53.250,Who's this one?
00:50:58.875,00:51:03.041,"And I could've saved some, had you set aside your love of coin and helped."
00:51:08.166,00:51:10.916,She's using some strange alchemy to try to change them.
00:51:11.916,00:51:13.750,Change them to what?
00:51:13.833,00:51:15.458,Into whatever she's become.
00:51:16.333,00:51:21.750,"I tracked her here, tried stopping her, but… Kitsu's power… And she just let you live?"
00:51:21.833,00:51:25.541,I understand if that's a concept unfamiliar to your kind.
00:51:25.625,00:51:29.791,"If Kitsu was using sorcery to try and mutate those girls, who mutated her?"
00:51:33.541,00:51:36.458,Her genes were spliced with those of a mahr.
00:51:37.125,00:51:39.041,It explains her unnatural power.
00:51:39.666,00:51:40.916,She's a crossbreed.
00:51:41.000,00:51:42.708,How is such a thing possible?
00:51:42.791,00:51:44.375,The same way he was made.
00:51:45.166,00:51:46.583,Mutagenic alchemy.
00:51:46.666,00:51:49.500,Its secrets known only to mages at Kaer Morhen.
00:51:49.583,00:51:51.208,You're behind all this.
00:51:51.291,00:51:52.375,That's ridiculous.
00:51:57.541,00:51:59.041,Now you make them?
00:51:59.125,00:52:06.458,"Witchers are struggling, yes, but… Shame. A few new beasts would be… good for business."
00:52:10.333,00:52:11.708,Another sharp con.
00:52:21.291,00:52:22.666,Another monstrosity.
00:52:27.625,00:52:28.791,She's still an elf.
00:52:33.375,00:52:35.166,You saw what these creatures can do.
00:52:35.750,00:52:40.250,"Fil, if the girl has even half Kitsu's power, she's dangerous."
00:52:40.333,00:52:42.625,Doesn't this witch say similar of you?
00:52:43.750,00:52:47.416,I will take her back to my people. She will be raised as an elf.
00:52:48.416,00:52:52.083,Though I imagine it won't be too long before you sic her on us.
00:52:54.583,00:52:56.083,You beat us.
00:52:56.166,00:53:01.250,"At least allow us the indignity of scavenging whatever's left of our kind, mutant or otherwise."
00:53:02.541,00:53:04.541,As a favor to a friend.
00:53:07.041,00:53:09.166,Take the child and go. Now.
00:53:10.708,00:53:13.083,You have made a serious error.
00:53:13.875,00:53:17.750,"Should that girl ever harm a single soul, Fil-- Then I will slay her."
00:53:18.375,00:53:21.333,Quietly welcome you and your sword.
00:53:24.208,00:53:27.416,I should've offered up some coin. Then you would've handled matters.
00:53:27.500,00:53:29.375,It was not a question of price.
00:53:30.666,00:53:32.875,"Oh, the witcher's found his morals?"
00:53:32.958,00:53:36.000,"You think you're so pure, Tetra? Not a blemish?"
00:53:36.083,00:53:38.625,Look outside. There's your morality.
00:53:39.291,00:53:41.625,Rot and ruin all reeking of hate.
00:53:42.125,00:53:44.250,"Tend to that filth, and I'll tend to mine."
00:54:53.458,00:54:55.625,That's what Deglan said the first time we met.
00:54:56.166,00:54:57.041,Now look.
00:54:58.041,00:54:59.458,I need to know for certain.
00:55:07.166,00:55:08.791,I know what you have to do.
00:55:09.458,00:55:13.750,And I won't have you feeling as though you've abandoned me again.
00:55:52.458,00:55:59.375,"This one breeds monstrosities, terrorizes my kingdom, and swindles the people."
00:56:01.708,00:56:03.833,What the hell are you talking about?
00:56:04.416,00:56:07.791,"Sire, not all witchers were aware of these crossbreeds."
00:56:07.875,00:56:13.958,"Lady Zerbst, you are testament to the perils of trusting a servant."
00:56:15.208,00:56:24.916,"Your Highness-- If it pleases, sire, might I ask where Madam Gilcrest is now?"
00:57:24.416,00:57:26.083,I had to protect our way of life.
00:57:27.208,00:57:29.666,"Think of all the coin you stand to make, young fella."
00:57:29.750,00:57:32.791,"-Do not call me that. -Check your gratitude, boy."
00:57:32.875,00:57:34.000,You came to me.
00:57:34.083,00:57:36.916,I could've shipped you right back to those bedpans.
00:57:37.000,00:57:40.916,Don't pretend you didn't know exactly what you were doing when you threw me those coins.
00:57:41.000,00:57:42.291,You knew I would come.
00:57:43.000,00:57:46.375,"We were created to kill creatures like these, not to make them."
00:57:46.458,00:57:48.708,I won't weep for doing what needed doing.
00:57:49.333,00:57:50.875,I told you.
00:57:52.875,00:57:53.958,"Oh, I know."
00:57:54.041,00:57:57.958,What about with the elf? Did you give Kitsu a choice before you mutated her?
00:57:58.625,00:58:00.333,"No, I thought we'd killed her."
00:58:00.416,00:58:03.375,That mutation was unstable. Too much power.
00:58:04.041,00:58:07.500,"Clearly, her death was one of her clever little illusions."
00:58:11.125,00:58:14.041,You were always too focused on the gold in your hand.
00:58:14.708,00:58:17.833,You never looked up to see who's paying you. See their eyes.
00:58:18.416,00:58:19.333,We terrify 'em.
00:58:19.916,00:58:25.666,The only thing keeping men from hunting us are the scarier beasts we keep away.
00:58:26.333,00:58:31.416,"Humans die quick, so they spend their lives fearing and hating."
00:58:31.500,00:58:33.916,Ask the dwarves or your elf friend.
00:58:34.000,00:58:36.375,Men will always need monsters.
00:58:37.083,00:58:39.625,"-Now, so do we. -We're all orphans."
00:58:39.708,00:58:42.166,We've always looked to you to protect us.
00:58:42.250,00:58:45.791,You have to burn it to the ground… or I will.
00:58:52.833,00:58:54.333,I don't want to fight you.
00:58:54.416,00:58:56.375,"We've got to protect ourselves, Vesemir."
00:59:00.541,00:59:01.791,Got to protect you!
00:59:08.666,00:59:15.208,"If you two would like to stop trying to kill each other, we have a visitor."
00:59:31.833,00:59:34.625,Tetra wasted no time. Word spread quickly.
00:59:35.291,00:59:38.583,"Not only of the crossbreeds, but of witchers protecting elves."
00:59:39.083,00:59:40.125,And Luka?
00:59:42.125,00:59:43.500,This is your two's doing.
00:59:43.583,00:59:46.250,"They were always gonna come, sooner or later."
00:59:49.875,00:59:54.333,My mages and I are the ones who know the secrets to mutagenic alchemy.
00:59:54.416,00:59:56.916,Tetra will want our heads most.
00:59:57.000,01:00:02.291,"If we die, there can be no more witchers."
01:00:03.333,01:00:05.291,Seal yourselves in your labs.
01:00:05.375,01:00:07.875,The rest of us will rally and end her little cult.
01:00:08.458,01:00:09.708,Bitch won't see dawn.
01:00:11.750,01:00:15.625,Underestimate Tetra and you'll be the one who's seen their last sunrise.
01:00:22.666,01:00:26.291,He may be a bastard… but Deglan is right.
01:00:27.166,01:00:28.458,This was inevitable.
01:00:28.541,01:00:29.583,Why?
01:00:36.416,01:00:38.500,I want you as far away from this place as possible.
01:00:38.583,01:00:40.166,There are children here.
01:00:40.250,01:00:43.416,"-They've been trained. -Children, Vesemir."
01:00:43.500,01:00:45.416,As you were when he took you.
01:00:45.500,01:00:48.583,I'll guide them to the cellar until the battle's won.
01:00:49.166,01:00:52.875,"For once, I will decide my place."
01:00:53.708,01:00:55.333,You've always had too much fire.
01:00:56.000,01:00:57.166,And beauty.
01:00:57.250,01:01:00.333,Please… I'm nearly 70.
01:01:05.041,01:01:06.041,So am I.
01:01:31.833,01:01:34.916,Beautiful peaks. Too pure for war.
01:01:35.000,01:01:39.958,"Scurry off and return with the body of the man you murdered, witch."
01:01:40.041,01:01:44.000,He was executed in the name of those your homemade beasts butchered.
01:01:44.500,01:01:46.666,"There'll be no more of them, Tetra."
01:01:46.750,01:01:47.666,Upon my word.
01:01:49.125,01:01:51.541,"Well, witchers are experts in price."
01:01:51.625,01:01:54.166,"What is the worth of your word, Vesemir?"
01:01:54.250,01:01:57.291,Some things… are beyond cost.
01:01:59.333,01:02:00.166,And you?
01:02:01.083,01:02:02.583,Do you give me your word?
01:02:03.125,01:02:04.625,I give you nothing.
01:02:04.708,01:02:09.500,Save the chance to fill the valleys of our pretty peaks with your corpses.
01:02:10.291,01:02:12.250,We are an army of witchers.
01:02:12.333,01:02:13.541,You are human.
01:03:06.041,01:03:09.791,"destroyed her work, and murdered the girl, her only child."
01:03:11.125,01:03:12.791,Monsters to fight monsters.
01:03:13.416,01:03:14.875,How unlike your predecessors.
01:03:27.166,01:03:29.666,"Steel your nerves, lads. We charge!"
01:03:32.958,01:03:34.500,Just bloody trust me for once!
01:03:37.833,01:03:38.791,Please!
01:03:43.166,01:03:44.958,"Witchers, on me!"
01:04:07.041,01:04:08.041,You're safe.
01:05:05.750,01:05:11.833,"Witchers must be wiped from the surface of this Earth, and all traces strewn with salt and saltpeter."
01:05:40.583,01:05:44.458,Me and the others will hold the bridge. Use the drop to halve their numbers.
01:05:46.000,01:05:48.083,"You two, stop her!"
01:05:49.291,01:05:51.458,"Can you forgive me long enough, young fella?"
01:08:03.625,01:08:06.041,"If she gets Reidrich, it's the end of us."
01:08:08.625,01:08:09.875,Find her!
01:08:24.875,01:08:26.875,There's a hatch in the grain hold.
01:08:26.958,01:08:29.041,It lets out on the back pathway.
01:08:29.125,01:08:30.375,How do you know this?
01:08:30.458,01:08:32.000,He was trying to run away!
01:08:34.750,01:08:36.666,Run as far away as possible.
01:08:36.750,01:08:37.583,All of you.
01:08:37.666,01:08:40.458,"Rub the heel raw, to the bone, if you have to."
01:08:40.541,01:08:41.583,Don't stop.
01:08:59.541,01:09:01.333,"This is genocide, Tetra."
01:09:01.916,01:09:06.125,They bred those monsters because of you. There is no purity here.
01:09:06.208,01:09:08.000,Just fear and hatred.
01:09:08.083,01:09:10.541,"Enough, please!"
01:09:11.375,01:09:14.041,This servant betrays Kaedwen to the witchers.
01:09:15.000,01:09:16.166,Let her join them.
01:09:25.083,01:09:27.458,I can drop your men before their blades drop an inch.
01:09:39.541,01:09:45.208,"Are you going to enjoy the day, or are you still too shook from another daring night of monster-slaying?"
01:09:50.166,01:09:51.416,"Look at you, though."
01:09:52.708,01:09:54.041,You're a witcher.
01:09:54.791,01:09:56.041,You're rich!
01:09:57.291,01:10:02.000,"We'll lack for nothing, and you'll take care of me, Vesemir."
01:10:02.083,01:10:04.875,Much like you said. True to your word.
01:10:08.875,01:10:11.083,-Look at me. -A lake house.
01:10:11.875,01:10:14.208,Wine. Food.
01:10:14.291,01:10:18.083,Imagine the seas of coin we'd wade in.
01:10:19.625,01:10:22.416,You never wanted that! You were always content.
01:10:23.000,01:10:23.916,"No, no, no!"
01:10:29.166,01:10:30.833,That poor midwife!
01:10:30.916,01:10:34.875,"Oh, oh, tell 'em about the time you swindled the Redanian priest."
01:10:34.958,01:10:37.208,Had him thinking he was cursed!
01:10:37.791,01:10:41.875,-How much did you take that fool for? -You can't be here. We lost you.
01:10:45.125,01:10:46.833,What are you prattling about?
01:10:53.583,01:10:55.583,Not a coin spared.
01:11:02.291,01:11:04.458,Enough! All of you!
01:11:04.541,01:11:06.166,Stop… stop cackling!
01:11:10.125,01:11:11.166,"Be honest, now."
01:11:11.250,01:11:14.333,"Well, don't just stand there. Say it."
01:11:16.583,01:11:18.750,"You hate it, don't you?"
01:11:21.166,01:11:24.333,I was just weighing whether you'd done my dashing looks justice.
01:11:27.750,01:11:32.375,"Such a look in your eyes. So crestfallen and… It's perfect, Illyana."
01:11:33.458,01:11:34.500,Flawless.
01:11:45.750,01:11:47.666,Don't dally. I'm thirsty.
01:11:49.666,01:11:51.250,Mama! Make Bojan stop!
01:11:51.333,01:11:53.250,He's run away with my jacks!
01:11:54.791,01:11:57.708,"What's wrong, Papa? You're making the sad face."
01:11:58.291,01:12:01.208,"No, no… This is wrong."
01:12:01.291,01:12:03.833,"Enough mind games, Kitsu. No more fantasies."
01:12:06.541,01:12:09.333,"But you swore you'd care for me, didn't you?"
01:12:10.333,01:12:11.500,That you'd protect me.
01:12:12.541,01:12:13.916,You're not real.
01:12:14.000,01:12:17.208,Truth is no illusion. There's no escaping it.
01:12:20.041,01:12:22.125,"You left me here, darling."
01:12:22.208,01:12:25.041,Stranded in hopes and dreams abandoned.
01:12:25.125,01:12:27.833,And now you're trying to leave me again.
01:12:27.916,01:12:36.666,"Only this time, I won't be buried I'll be as you are. Lost and alone."
01:12:36.750,01:12:38.791,Unloved!
01:12:38.875,01:12:40.958,"No, Illyana. I love you."
01:12:41.041,01:12:42.458,Coin's your real lover.
01:12:43.416,01:12:46.250,"More of her to pluck out there, isn't there?"
01:12:46.750,01:12:47.708,Stop it.
01:12:47.791,01:12:50.375,"We can be whatever we imagine here, Vesemir."
01:12:50.458,01:12:51.750,We can be rich.
01:12:58.708,01:13:00.541,"Out there, I can save her."
01:13:01.458,01:13:02.791,That's worth more.
01:13:02.875,01:13:04.208,"Now, out of my head."
01:13:42.708,01:13:44.041,You were only a child.
01:13:44.541,01:13:46.083,How were you to know?
01:14:01.541,01:14:02.625,Stay back!
01:14:37.333,01:14:39.291,You come at me with magic tricks?
01:15:21.208,01:15:22.958,No! No!
01:15:23.625,01:15:24.958,"No, no, no, no!"
01:15:33.500,01:15:36.416,This… this isn't real.
01:15:39.666,01:15:42.500,I didn't know much about witchers when I was young.
01:15:42.583,01:15:45.625,"I didn't know you could smell better, hear better."
01:15:46.333,01:15:54.083,"I didn't know that the witcher sensed me in the cupboard, trembling, barely breathing, watching as he drove his sword through my mother."
01:15:54.583,01:15:58.250,The silly sorceress who'd crossed a gullible priest.
01:15:59.250,01:16:01.250,Monsters to kill monsters.
01:16:06.375,01:16:23.791,Aye… So… Take her and go.
01:16:25.625,01:16:27.916,Sven? The others?
01:16:29.500,01:16:30.333,Dead.
01:16:31.583,01:16:33.000,All my boys.
01:16:39.166,01:16:40.291,Keep your strength.
01:16:42.541,01:16:44.625,"They're your boys now, young fella."
01:16:45.208,01:16:46.375,Make 'em witchers.
01:16:46.875,01:16:49.791,Make 'em… somethin' more.
01:16:52.375,01:16:54.125,To better men.
01:17:12.375,01:17:15.333,She didn't ask for this.
01:18:29.083,01:18:31.666,It doesn't seem… real.
01:19:02.166,01:19:03.250,Huh?
01:19:18.791,01:19:21.666,This is the last time I allow any of you to ever hesitate.
01:19:22.333,01:19:23.416,Decide.
01:19:24.916,01:19:26.291,But they hate us.
01:19:27.625,01:19:30.333,There'll always be another monster… Geralt.
