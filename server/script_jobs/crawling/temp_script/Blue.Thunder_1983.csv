00:21:08.017,00:21:09.769,At 3:00 a.m.?
00:21:09.810,00:21:13.231,"Well, Frank, you have this problem."
00:21:13.272,00:21:14.314,It's in the kitchen.
00:21:16.734,00:21:17.944,"Hold him for me, will you?"
00:21:19.653,00:21:21.321,This kid must be deaf.
00:21:22.823,00:21:26.660,-You coming?
00:21:26.702,00:21:29.538,The Shocks' anniversary party.
00:21:29.580,00:21:33.834,Annie's been open for a year now.
00:21:29.580,00:21:37.797,We're gonna have guacamole and margaritas and chilly rellenos...
00:21:41.425,00:21:43.177,"Fat chance, huh?"
00:21:45.179,00:21:47.765,That must've been some leave you had down there in Laguna.
00:21:47.807,00:21:50.935,What did you do?
00:21:51.644,00:21:53.312,"Oh, here it is!"
00:21:55.940,00:21:57.524,"Hey, what's this?"
00:22:05.116,00:22:08.035,This is beautiful. Really!
00:22:09.578,00:22:12.165,-Could I please borrow this...
00:22:12.206,00:22:14.083,I'll wash it and everything.
00:22:14.125,00:22:16.961,"No, you can't."
00:22:17.003,00:22:19.755,-Really?
00:22:19.797,00:22:22.842,Never mind.
00:22:26.512,00:22:28.306,"KATE: Frank, I miss you."
00:22:28.346,00:22:30.808,I don't eat.
00:22:30.850,00:22:33.311,MURPHY: Maybe you ought to trade me in on a surfer.
00:22:33.351,00:22:38.816,"Well, I tried that once, but it didn't work."
00:22:38.858,00:22:41.194,"Come to think of it, neither did he."
00:22:41.986,00:22:43.821,"Good night, Murphy."
00:22:43.863,00:22:47.867,"Oh. Good night, you little faker."
00:22:48.993,00:22:50.286,Watch your legs.
00:22:53.206,00:22:58.836,"Frank, we gotta get serious."
00:23:01.214,00:23:06.260,"Now, I know you have a lot of problems right now and I'd really like to help you."
00:23:06.302,00:23:09.972,-Uh-huh.
00:23:10.014,00:23:14.518,-Joe Louis. That's very good.
00:23:14.560,00:23:19.523,"Frank, I'm gonna have to get tough on you."
00:23:19.982,00:23:21.399,I'm ready.
00:23:48.010,00:23:52.223,"Five, four, three, two, one..."
00:23:52.265,00:23:54.308,"Cue Mario, take one."
00:23:54.350,00:24:01.982,The top story is still the assault and attempted rape of Diana McNeely of the mayor's Task Force on Urban Violence.
00:24:02.024,00:24:04.277,McNeely's still on the critical list.
00:24:04.318,00:24:07.487,We spoke to Chief Jensen about the latest news.
00:24:07.529,00:24:10.283,JENSEN: We have nothing on the two assailants.
00:24:10.324,00:24:16.830,"They were without identification, probably Latin American and almost certainly illegal aliens."
00:24:16.872,00:24:23.545,Our fingerprint teams are going over their car which was stolen from a Santa Monica parking lot.
00:24:23.587,00:24:31.304,REPORTER: It is unclear what impact this latest incident will have on the minority community and the increasing racial tensions that...
00:24:32.263,00:24:38.185,We've just received word that Alf Hewitt is standing by St. Joseph's hospital for a live report.
00:24:38.227,00:24:41.479,Commissioner Diana McNeely died at 8:47 a.m.
00:24:41.521,00:24:48.404,due to complications from a gunshot wound which penetrated her neck and lodged in her spinal column beneath the third cervical vertebrae.
00:24:48.446,00:24:53.451,"Miss McNeely never regained consciousness and if she had lived, she would've been totally paralyzed."
00:24:53.491,00:24:56.494,"This is Alf Hewitt, live from St. Joseph's Hospital."
00:26:19.078,00:26:21.414,I've been trying to get you all night.
00:26:21.455,00:26:23.623,Why don't you answer your beeper?
00:26:23.665,00:26:27.378,"I just wanna tell you, Jack, that next time I'm suspended, so's my fucking beeper!"
00:26:28.421,00:26:31.382,-Feel better?
00:26:31.424,00:26:35.386,Then get your ass down here.
00:26:45.479,00:26:48.274,-You're back on flying status.
00:26:48.315,00:26:50.734,You're assigned a special detail.
00:26:53.611,00:26:57.450,"This is Mr. Icelan, Mr. Fletcher, from Washington."
00:26:57.491,00:26:59.743,Mr. Frank Murphy.
00:26:59.785,00:27:03.705,"Yeah, we're glad we found you."
00:27:03.747,00:27:07.167,-What do they call that place?
00:27:07.209,00:27:10.504,Everything I'm about to tell you is highly classified.
00:27:10.546,00:27:12.630,You don't discuss it with anybody.
00:27:12.672,00:27:15.217,We're testing a new helicopter prototype.
00:27:15.259,00:27:24.560,We've got our own pilot but your city's been chosen as the testing area and your mayor is very anxious that his people participate.
00:27:24.602,00:27:28.814,"Ours is not to reason why, ours is but to submit to the vagaries of local politicians."
00:27:28.855,00:27:30.023,Mr. Icelan.
00:27:50.336,00:27:51.837,"Smoke? Frank, is it?"
00:27:52.712,00:27:53.922,No. Yes.
00:27:55.549,00:27:56.674,No smoke. Yes Frank.
00:28:01.639,00:28:06.143,"I understand that you flew in Vietnam, Frank."
00:28:06.185,00:28:07.269,That's right.
00:28:08.354,00:28:11.482,"-Two tours, was it?"
00:28:11.524,00:28:13.108,"Why the foreshortened tour, Frank?"
00:28:13.150,00:28:15.902,You know what they say about a sucking chest wound.
00:28:15.944,00:28:18.405,Nature's way of telling you it's time to go home.
00:28:18.447,00:28:20.115,"Yeah, right. Right."
00:28:20.157,00:28:22.159,You gonna tell us about this special detail?
00:28:22.201,00:28:26.121,"Yeah, a lot of people are looking forward to the Olympics out here."
00:28:26.163,00:28:30.959,"And for a few short weeks, the attention of the world is gonna be focused on this town."
00:28:31.001,00:28:37.299,And every nutcase and terrorist and crazy with a pipe bomb and a cause is drooling about it already.
00:28:37.341,00:28:39.677,And that's what this detail's all about.
00:28:39.718,00:28:42.680,The potential for catastrophe.
00:28:42.721,00:28:45.807,We don't want any Munich massacres out here.
00:28:45.849,00:28:48.561,Are you talking about crowd control from the air?
00:28:48.602,00:28:51.771,Ah! Give that man a cigar.
00:28:51.813,00:28:54.441,That's been tried before.
00:28:54.483,00:28:56.402,"-Yeah, where was that?"
00:28:57.069,00:28:58.737,Ah...
00:28:59.613,00:29:01.781,We added a few new wrinkles.
00:29:01.823,00:29:04.910,-Such as?
00:29:25.556,00:29:30.394,You say this thing has antiterrorist capabilities.
00:29:30.436,00:29:33.731,-That I am.
00:29:33.772,00:29:36.858,That sounds like it now.
00:29:36.900,00:29:39.319,I thought it was illegal to arm police helicopters.
00:29:39.361,00:29:42.322,"That would depend on the circumstances, wouldn't it?"
00:29:42.364,00:29:45.200,MURPHY: A lot of people ain't gonna like this.
00:29:45.242,00:29:47.703,"What do you call that thing, an airbuster?"
00:29:47.745,00:29:51.164,The Special.
00:29:51.206,00:29:54.000,-MURPHY: What?
00:29:54.585,00:29:55.794,Blue Thunder.
00:30:27.409,00:30:30.829,"MAN: Look, gentlemen, you wanna take your seats?"
00:30:33.832,00:30:40.464,"She don't look normal, she don't fly normal, because she ain't normal."
00:30:51.475,00:30:58.440,This whole ship is heavily armored with Nordoc NATO armor one inch thick.
00:30:58.482,00:31:04.404,This ship is equipped with a forward mounted 20 mm electric cannon.
00:31:04.446,00:31:12.078,Its six barrels are capable of firing 4000 rounds of ammunition per minute.
00:31:12.120,00:31:17.626,"And that, gentlemen, is one hell of a shit storm in anybody's language."
00:31:17.668,00:31:22.172,"Now, let's take a look and watch the lady strut her stuff."
00:31:27.678,00:31:31.223,"The red dummies represent terrorists, the white are civilians."
00:31:31.264,00:31:32.725,Innocent bystanders.
00:31:36.520,00:31:41.692,"Now, the object is for our pilot to knock out the red dummies and the black cars."
00:31:41.734,00:31:44.027,He shouldn't touch any of the others.
00:31:45.779,00:31:50.450,"You see, in a riot situation, we just want to get the bad guys and protect the innocents."
00:32:11.054,00:32:14.307,"Oh, my God!"
00:32:14.349,00:32:21.022,That kind of firepower would only be used in our worst-case scenario like armed insurrection.
00:32:21.064,00:32:23.859,It's comforting to know you got it on tap.
00:32:23.901,00:32:25.861,"MAN: Gentlemen, let me have your attention."
00:32:25.903,00:32:28.196,Now notice the selectivity of the firing.
00:32:28.238,00:32:31.867,This is not a strafing run where you tear up a whole street.
00:32:31.909,00:32:35.871,This little lady picks her targets carefully.
00:33:08.737,00:33:12.115,Look at that.
00:33:12.157,00:33:13.992,"Yeah, and a few white ones."
00:33:14.033,00:33:17.871,One civilian dead for every 10 terrorists.
00:33:18.914,00:33:21.166,Unless you're one of the civilians.
00:33:21.207,00:33:23.752,MAN: All right.
00:33:23.794,00:33:26.087,Anybody wanna bet on the school bus?
00:33:47.693,00:33:50.487,We haven't told our pilot everything about the bus.
00:33:50.529,00:33:53.156,Let's see if he can pick up on what's wrong with it.
00:34:19.558,00:34:20.934,Damn it! Bloody gun!
00:34:38.410,00:34:45.042,"MAN: All right, gentlemen, if you come down below, we'll take a closer look and I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have."
00:35:07.564,00:35:10.233,"Terrific shooting, colonel."
00:35:10.275,00:35:12.027,"Oh, beautiful, was it?"
00:35:12.069,00:35:14.780,Goddamn it!
00:35:19.576,00:35:22.037,I nearly killed you on that second pass.
00:35:22.079,00:35:24.915,"If it happens again, I'll have their balls for breakfast."
00:35:24.957,00:35:27.375,Come over here.
00:35:27.417,00:35:29.294,"Well, what do you know."
00:35:30.211,00:35:31.922,Friend of yours?
00:35:31.964,00:35:36.843,An old war buddy.
00:35:36.885,00:35:38.261,Sorry I brought it up.
00:35:38.303,00:35:39.930,"Well, well, look who it isn't."
00:35:39.972,00:35:42.933,"Colonel Cochrane, this is Captain Braddock of Astro Division."
00:35:42.975,00:35:46.561,And Frank Murphy.
00:35:48.313,00:35:49.731,Finally made colonel?
00:35:49.773,00:35:52.275,"If you're a nice guy, nice things happen to you."
00:35:52.317,00:35:53.359,I'll try to remember that.
00:35:57.114,00:35:58.824,MAN: Step this way for any questions.
00:36:02.035,00:36:03.954,How did we draw him?
00:36:03.996,00:36:06.289,"He was assigned to us, he and his observer."
00:36:06.331,00:36:10.209,-I didn't realize you were acquainted.
00:36:10.251,00:36:14.380,I'd have had that bastard up on charges if he hadn't caught some shrapnel.
00:36:14.422,00:36:17.092,He's totally unsuitable for our purpose.
00:36:17.134,00:36:18.969,I'll call Mr. Holmes tonight.
00:36:19.011,00:36:21.638,"No, don't bother him."
00:36:21.680,00:36:26.267,MAN: ...30 million candlepower night sun with an infrared filter.
00:36:26.309,00:36:30.313,"Over here is your TV camera, with 100-to-1 zoom lens."
00:36:30.355,00:36:33.733,-We could've used this in Vietnam.
00:36:34.860,00:36:36.862,Do you think you can fly it?
00:36:37.779,00:36:39.489,"You flew it, didn't you?"
00:36:42.367,00:36:44.243,I'll check you out myself tomorrow.
00:36:44.285,00:36:46.788,"Be on the pad, 12:00 sharp."
00:36:47.998,00:36:49.166,12:00 sharp.
00:36:50.375,00:36:52.085,Catch you later.
00:36:53.545,00:36:55.672,Stand back from there.
00:36:55.714,00:36:58.633,"Irritating little cocksucker, isn't he?"
00:37:07.475,00:37:11.270,"-Hey, tequila breath!"
00:37:11.312,00:37:15.274,-How do you like day shifts?
00:37:15.316,00:37:17.986,"-So, what's happening?"
00:37:18.028,00:37:20.697,"But listen, what do you make of this?"
00:37:21.823,00:37:23.282,What it is?
00:37:23.324,00:37:25.994,I don't know. I found it where Diana McNeely was killed.
00:37:26.036,00:37:28.872,I think it's about that urban violence stuff.
00:37:28.914,00:37:30.999,Can you translate this?
00:37:31.041,00:37:33.752,"I gotta log in, but I'll get back to you later."
00:37:33.793,00:37:35.503,All right.
00:37:35.545,00:37:38.090,"Boss, right under the hat."
00:37:38.131,00:37:40.633,MURPHY: I gotta get dressed.
00:37:40.675,00:37:42.219,"Hey, thanks for the hat."
00:37:42.260,00:37:45.097,-How's it going?
00:37:45.138,00:37:49.601,Look up. Look down.
00:37:49.642,00:37:51.394,"-I said, Don't worry."
00:37:54.064,00:37:56.441,You know what he told me the other day? Montoya?
00:37:56.482,00:37:59.903,He told me you looped one of those things.
00:37:59.945,00:38:02.239,You didn't.
00:38:02.280,00:38:03.615,"No, he wasn't."
00:38:03.656,00:38:05.700,You mean you actually looped a chopper?
00:38:05.742,00:38:07.619,-That's right.
00:38:07.660,00:38:10.122,MURPHY: When I was young and stupid.
00:38:23.468,00:38:27.639,LYMANGOOD: You're telling me it was a complete 360?
00:38:27.680,00:38:30.642,-A full loop.
00:38:30.683,00:38:33.686,It is.
00:38:33.728,00:38:36.314,Anyone who tells you any different is a damn liar.
00:38:38.733,00:38:41.611,"Now, you take the Ranger and I'll be in my bird."
00:38:41.653,00:38:44.322,We'll have a little game.
00:38:48.326,00:38:49.327,Catch you later.
00:38:59.504,00:39:02.132,"COCHRANE: Murphy, this is Cochrane."
00:39:02.174,00:39:06.303,"Join formation with me, echelon right."
00:39:06.344,00:39:07.553,"Roger that, colonel."
00:39:09.806,00:39:12.017,"Wanna show me that loop, Murphy?"
00:39:14.102,00:39:15.436,Negatory.
00:39:15.478,00:39:19.524,I thought so.
00:39:34.206,00:39:35.957,"COCHRANE: Come on, keep it tight."
00:39:35.999,00:39:37.583,Christ!
00:39:37.625,00:39:41.004,"Any closer, we start eating blades."
00:39:41.046,00:39:43.256,We're following his leader.
00:39:48.803,00:39:53.308,Okay. Now push it over and pick up speed.
00:40:01.482,00:40:03.985,Now follow me through a high-speed climbing turn.
00:40:20.501,00:40:22.754,COCHRANE: Level out at 500 feet.
00:40:29.094,00:40:32.347,"All right, Mr. Murphy."

01:03:05.532,01:03:06.575,Rough her up?
01:03:08.118,01:03:10.621,Is that the latest euphemism for assassination?
01:03:10.662,01:03:17.419,"MAN 4: Well, she had street informants, and she'd made the connection between our project and the trouble in the streets."

01:05:27.883,01:05:32.554,If I don't have an ass when I get out of this chair it's because the old man chewed it off just like that.
01:05:42.230,01:05:46.443,"I think you're beautiful when you're angry, but let's talk privately."
01:05:46.484,01:05:49.571,We don't have any secrets from Mr. Icelan.
01:05:49.613,01:05:52.990,"You're off the program, Frank, you and your buddy Lymangood."

01:08:22.015,01:08:25.435,And I think you'd rather it be sooner.
01:08:25.476,01:08:34.193,"Because first, we're gonna break your fingers, then your arm, and then maybe your knees."
01:08:34.235,01:08:38.698,"Now, I know you don't believe me so I'm gonna show you."
01:08:48.165,01:08:50.543,"Now, can it be sooner?"

01:13:38.331,01:13:40.333,Why don't we just blank the tape?
01:13:40.375,01:13:43.627,"That's what it's designed for, right?"
01:13:43.669,01:13:47.382,They tell me Lymangood changed the code numbers.
01:13:47.423,01:13:50.426,To go through every possible combination would take forever.
01:13:53.596,01:13:57.392,"Ugh. The trouble is, we don't have forever."
01:14:23.918,01:14:26.129,"LYMANGOOD: Hey, boss. How's it going?"

01:14:49.777,01:14:53.614,"This is getting kind of fun, huh?"
01:14:54.824,01:14:56.617,Well...

01:17:50.583,01:17:53.336,"We're gonna get the Air Force, Braddock, and now!"
01:17:53.377,01:17:58.007,He called Channel 8 first.
01:17:58.048,01:18:02.719,"Look, forget about the police."
01:18:02.761,01:18:04.972,Looks like the bastard wants to go public!
01:18:05.014,01:18:07.099,-We'll stop that.
01:19:29.599,01:19:31.267,"Come on, move out!"
01:19:33.769,01:19:34.895,"Move, move!"
01:20:29.450,01:20:32.077,"-MAN 1: Damn it, I can't see nothing!"
01:21:38.561,01:21:40.855,Air-7 to Special One.
01:21:42.732,01:21:44.441,Air-7 to Special One.
01:21:45.234,01:21:48.278,"Hey, amigo! Buenos dias!"
01:21:48.320,01:21:50.197,No shit!
01:21:50.239,01:21:52.408,"Hey, you got to set that thing down, man."
01:21:52.449,01:21:54.993,We got two choppers full of SWAT guys.
01:21:57.913,01:22:01.917,Oh. It's getting real cozy up here.
01:22:01.958,01:22:04.336,Return to base or we're gonna open fire.
01:22:08.424,01:22:10.342,"Come on, will you, Murphy?"
01:22:13.596,01:22:14.971,"All right, knock him down."
01:22:20.185,01:22:23.397,"Okay, amigo, how's your auto-rotation technique?"
01:22:27.610,01:22:28.527,Son of a bitch!
01:22:41.331,01:22:42.666,Damn it! Hang on!
01:22:46.754,01:22:48.171,"Sorry about that, my friend."
01:22:59.266,01:23:01.268,Ah! Not again!
01:23:01.310,01:23:04.313,"All right, chaps."
01:24:33.777,01:24:35.278,-Pull up now!
01:25:23.201,01:25:25.161,"Okay, lady! Pull over!"
01:25:36.548,01:25:37.967,"KATE: Is there a problem, officer?"
01:25:38.008,01:25:40.260,"A den mother in a Vega, right?"
01:25:40.302,01:25:43.722,Now play it very cool.
01:25:44.807,01:25:46.182,Sure.
01:25:51.688,01:25:54.441,"-Maybe, I..."
01:27:03.135,01:27:08.515,Channel 8 is bringing you live coverage of a helicopter hijacking.
01:27:08.557,01:27:12.728,Stay inside your homes.
01:27:12.769,01:27:16.106,We've already lost one police car and two helicopters.
01:27:16.148,01:27:18.441,"Well, what now, gentlemen?"
01:27:18.483,01:27:20.861,I don't plan on losing more helicopters.
01:27:20.903,01:27:23.321,May I introduce Colonel Coe of the Air Force?
01:27:23.363,01:27:24.781,-Colonel.
01:27:24.823,01:27:27.534,We got a couple of F-16s standing by at March Field.
01:27:27.576,01:27:30.037,-F-16s?
01:27:30.079,01:27:31.329,All you've got to do is say the word.
01:27:31.371,01:27:34.666,The F-16 is armed with rockets.
01:27:34.708,01:27:38.045,The potential destruction of innocent life is unimaginable.
01:27:38.087,01:27:40.881,"Sir, the F-16 is armed with heat-seeking missiles."
01:27:40.923,01:27:43.759,We can surgically remove him from the air. Like a tumor.
01:27:43.800,01:27:45.468,We're not talking about a tumor.
01:27:53.102,01:27:54.770,MURPHY: You gotta make a right there!
01:27:59.524,01:28:00.776,"No, Kate!"
01:28:10.911,01:28:11.954,Oh!
01:28:16.374,01:28:18.627,"You're really riding with the angels, sweetheart."
01:28:47.489,01:28:49.825,That a girl. Good work!
01:29:03.338,01:29:05.215,Yes.
01:29:05.257,01:29:10.470,Ray Icelan at Astro says they've scrambled two F-16s out of March.
01:29:10.512,01:29:13.140,-What about the tape?
01:29:13.182,01:29:16.476,But he called KBLA.
01:29:16.518,01:29:19.146,MAN: I'll take care of you one at a time.
01:29:19.188,01:29:22.774,We'll have more help down here.
01:29:22.816,01:29:27.612,Sir! Sir! I've got to give this tape to Mr. Machado or Abe Hewitt.
01:29:27.654,01:29:29.114,MAN: They're very busy right now.
01:29:29.156,01:29:31.158,"KATE: Yes, but this is important."
01:29:31.200,01:29:35.996,MAN: There's a crazy man in a helicopter. I'll tell somebody you're here.
01:29:36.038,01:29:38.999,The most dangerous thing is a man afraid for his job.
01:29:39.041,01:29:41.835,"Hi, I'm Dick Fisher."
01:29:41.877,01:29:45.505,"Uh, no, I have to give this to Mr. Mocher or..."
01:29:45.547,01:29:47.341,-Machado.
01:29:47.381,01:29:50.302,I'm his producer.
01:29:51.178,01:29:52.888,"No, I don't think so."
01:29:52.929,01:29:55.431,MAN: Can't we simply erase it?
01:29:55.473,01:29:57.517,We don't know the code number.
01:29:58.935,01:30:00.770,Then erase them all.
01:30:00.812,01:30:02.356,MAN: Why don't you give it to me...
01:30:02.396,01:30:05.775,KATE: No. Frank said to give it to Mr. Hewitt...
01:30:05.817,01:30:09.612,I'm Alf Hewitt. You're the lady with the tape from Frank Murphy?
01:30:09.654,01:30:11.614,Your producer said that Mr...
01:30:11.656,01:30:13.992,-Who?
01:30:14.034,01:30:16.161,I never saw this guy before.
01:30:16.203,01:30:18.663,Not so fast.
01:30:18.705,01:30:21.375,-Get your hands off me!
01:30:22.084,01:30:23.752,Get this bastard off me!
01:30:25.379,01:30:27.089,Son of a bitch!
01:30:29.591,01:30:31.843,"Go, go, go!"
01:30:58.995,01:31:01.873,"MAN: March Control, this is Little Brother One."
01:31:01.915,01:31:06.502,We have your target bearing 121 at 13 miles.
01:31:06.544,01:31:09.923,Request clearance to engage.
01:31:09.965,01:31:13.093,"Roger, Little Brother."
01:31:13.135,01:31:16.012,Affirmative.
01:31:16.054,01:31:18.932,"I repeat, engage and destroy."
01:31:30.402,01:31:34.072,There he is.
01:32:36.092,01:32:37.802,Holy shit!
01:32:51.024,01:32:52.192,BRADDOCK: What?
01:32:53.860,01:32:56.946,"Well, I'll be damned."
01:32:56.988,01:33:01.493,One of your missiles just took out a barbeque shack down in Little Tokyo.
01:33:01.535,01:33:05.288,"-Francis, isn't that Ray's district?"
01:33:05.330,01:33:06.956,-Do you have his number?
01:33:06.998,01:33:11.920,"You better call him, or they'll call him and he'll call us -I'm on my way!"
01:33:51.293,01:33:53.253,"There he is, right there!"
01:33:56.965,01:33:59.092,"MAN 1: Everybody, this is an emergency!"
01:33:59.134,01:34:01.928,Clear the area.
01:34:08.143,01:34:10.103,"Well, what do you know!"
01:34:10.145,01:34:11.438,He froze.
01:34:12.730,01:34:15.400,"Okay, he's all mine now, cookie."
01:34:45.347,01:34:46.848,"Oh, my God!"
01:35:10.664,01:35:12.541,"I'm hit, cookie! I'm hit!"
01:35:12.582,01:35:14.334,He blew my damn wing off!
01:35:15.001,01:35:16.461,Mayday! Mayday!
01:35:16.503,01:35:19.297,This is Little Brother One.
01:35:56.042,01:35:59.962,We just lost an F-16 and the top of the Arco Tower.
01:36:00.004,01:36:01.964,That's it. Call it off.
01:36:02.006,01:36:06.469,May I remind you there is a crazy man up there with six 20 mm cannons?
01:36:06.511,01:36:08.388,"I said, call it off."
01:36:08.430,01:36:10.724,Request permission for takeoff.
01:36:10.764,01:36:14.185,"Colonel, hold your position."
01:36:14.227,01:36:18.064,"Repeat, hold your position."
01:37:53.284,01:37:54.369,Back to base.
01:38:06.422,01:38:10.009,HOLMES: Rough her up?
01:38:10.051,01:38:15.473,"MAN: She had street informants, and she'd connected our project to the trouble..."
01:38:15.515,01:38:17.809,"Jesus, Lollie, you ought to hear this stuff."
01:38:17.851,01:38:20.102,They sound like cops and feds.
01:38:20.144,01:38:23.439,They're stirring up the barrio to prove what that chopper can do.
01:38:23.481,01:38:25.400,It's all right here.
01:38:25.441,01:38:28.486,And you better tell Mario to go easy on that mad-sniper stuff.
01:38:28.528,01:38:32.114,That cop up there may be the hottest ticket since Horatius at the bridge.
01:39:42.143,01:39:43.937,"All right, let's try this."
01:40:21.557,01:40:22.851,Ah...
01:40:40.702,01:40:42.411,"All right, where are you?"
01:41:17.697,01:41:19.240,"Oh, damn it!"
01:42:02.157,01:42:06.412,"All right, Murphy. It's about time you put your money where your mouth is."
01:42:16.255,01:42:19.467,"One, two, three!"
01:42:19.884,01:42:21.970,Ah!
01:42:35.858,01:42:38.277,"Come on, you tub of shit!"
01:42:49.122,01:42:50.665,That's impossible!
01:43:08.516,01:43:09.433,Catch you later.
01:44:01.069,01:44:02.904,Okay.
01:44:02.945,01:44:04.780,And now it's your turn.
01:44:58.459,01:45:08.761,"prototype was destroyed when Officer Murphy, out of gas, set the helicopter down on the tracks in front of a freight train."
01:45:08.803,01:45:12.305,"That was the end of the special helicopter, but not the end of this story."
01:45:12.347,01:45:26.737,On the strength of a tape that Officer Murphy delivered to this reporter the mayor has reopened the investigation into the death of councilwoman McNeely which might also be connected with the death of Officer Lymangood of the Astro Division.
01:45:26.779,01:45:35.579,Half a dozen members of the local police department and several officials of both the State and the Justice departments have been detained for questioning.
01:45:35.621,01:45:41.210,"Coming up, the weather and a sneak preview of a bullet train soon to be seen in the Southland."
01:45:41.252,01:45:42.419,Maybe.
