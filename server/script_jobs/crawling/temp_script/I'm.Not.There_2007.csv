00:01:48.817,00:01:50.360,Star of electricity.
00:01:52.070,00:02:00.120,Nailed by a peeping Tom who would soon discover… A poem is like a naked person.
00:02:00.203,00:02:04.249,Even the ghost… was more than one person.
00:02:11.673,00:02:14.175,But a song is something that walks by itself.
00:04:54.085,00:04:57.630,"Hey. How old are you, boy?"
00:04:58.756,00:05:00.508,Eleven years old.
00:05:00.591,00:05:01.759,Oh.
00:05:02.760,00:05:04.470,"What's your name, son?"
00:05:05.054,00:05:06.514,Woody.
00:05:06.597,00:05:08.057,Woody Guthrie.
00:05:08.891,00:05:10.518,Just like the singer.
00:05:11.644,00:05:16.524,"Way I see it, singin's kept me right in this world more than any Bible's ever done."

00:05:24.449,00:05:27.243,"Hey, Joe. What do you make about that?"
00:05:29.412,00:05:35.251,"Uh, son… you wouldn't be stashin' no weapons in that case of yours?"
00:05:35.335,00:05:37.920,"No, sir. Not in any literalized way."
00:05:42.925,00:05:44.719,A-R-T-H.
00:05:44.802,00:05:46.012,Please sit down.

00:06:03.279,00:06:06.491,"That makes you 19, nearly 20."
00:06:06.574,00:06:07.867,Is that correct?
00:06:07.950,00:06:09.410,That's correct.
00:06:11.621,00:06:13.081,So what's all this about?
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.502,A little town called Riddle.
00:06:18.127,00:06:19.921,"But all over, really."
00:06:20.463,00:06:25.760,"Been to Gallup, Phillipsburg, Sioux Falls… I got me a cousin in Sioux Falls."
00:06:25.843,00:06:27.428,Yeah! That's right.
00:06:28.679,00:06:31.432,"Uh, is there really a town called Riddle?"
00:06:31.516,00:06:35.269,"Tell you the flat truth, that's sort of a… a whatchamacallit."
00:06:35.353,00:06:38.314,"A, uh… A composite."
00:06:44.987,00:06:49.617,"Truth is, my mind got mixed with ramblin' when I was, oh, so young."
00:06:50.326,00:06:55.123,"I reckon it was Arvella Gray, the blind protest singer from Chicago."
00:06:55.206,00:07:00.419,She first taught me the blues four… about five years back.
00:07:01.003,00:07:04.215,That's also when I first started writin' songs on my own.
00:07:04.298,00:07:05.550,I've written some hillbilly songs.
00:07:05.633,00:07:08.136,"You know Carl Perkins, from Nashville?"
00:07:08.219,00:07:10.805,"-Yeah, yeah. -He sings some of my songs."
00:07:10.888,00:07:13.349,"Yep. Talkin' blues kind of stuff, you know?"
00:07:13.433,00:07:14.475,Union songs.
00:07:15.059,00:07:17.353,I also played piano with Bobby Vee.
00:07:18.563,00:07:21.441,I would've been a millionaire if I stayed with him.
00:07:23.818,00:07:26.821,"Well, what brings you around these parts?"
00:07:30.908,00:07:32.326,Carelessness.
00:07:41.502,00:07:43.212,And I started drinking.
00:07:47.300,00:07:49.802,"Next thing I know, I'm in a crap game."
00:07:49.886,00:07:51.554,I wake up in a pool hall.
00:07:51.637,00:07:57.059,"One night, I meet up with a Chinaman working at a dime store who says he loves my sound."
00:07:57.768,00:08:02.773,"And next thing I know, I'm all booked up at his boss's establishment."
00:08:03.274,00:08:05.276,The Tiny Troubadour!
00:08:25.838,00:08:26.964,"There you go, boy."

00:08:48.486,00:08:50.196,One or all-time losers.
00:08:51.197,00:08:52.907,Call us what you will.
00:08:54.534,00:08:58.663,"Deep down, we're all getting ready to tuck our heads under our wings for sleep."
00:08:59.497,00:09:02.124,We of the Pullman side-car and the sunburned thumb.
00:09:02.750,00:09:04.252,We ain't kidding ourselves.
00:09:05.878,00:09:08.130,It's lonesome roads we shall walk.
00:09:11.425,00:09:13.553,Till I joined the Union cause!
00:09:16.305,00:09:19.475,Don't he know it's 1959?
00:09:19.559,00:09:22.687,We done unionized 20 years ago.
00:09:26.691,00:09:28.234,that you've stopped writing.
00:09:28.317,00:09:31.696,I've been on too many streets to be doing the same thing over and over.
00:09:31.779,00:09:33.155,Can I smoke in here?
00:09:34.615,00:09:38.077,"for someone so widely known, a bit fatalistic."
00:09:38.160,00:09:39.787,I'm not fatalistic.
00:09:40.913,00:09:44.792,Bank tellers are fatalistic. Clerks are fatalistic. I'm a farmer.
00:09:45.501,00:09:47.920,Who ever heard of a fatalistic farmer?
00:10:59.116,00:11:00.242,Oh!
00:11:03.204,00:11:08.084,"Boy, look like you found… you found your freedom before you found your technique."
00:11:11.087,00:11:12.963,You take Blind Willie McTell.
00:11:13.047,00:11:15.299,He's the best blues singer east of Cannery Row.
00:11:15.383,00:11:20.638,"He say, Son, if you can sing these songs and understand them, ain't no place you can't go."
00:11:21.931,00:11:23.641,"Ah, thank you very much, ma'am."
00:11:23.724,00:11:24.642,You're welcome.
00:11:24.725,00:11:28.354,I reckon I come out the womb singing and picking and playing and all that mess.
00:11:28.437,00:11:29.939,So where your people at?
00:11:30.022,00:11:30.981,Your kinfolk?
00:11:31.482,00:11:32.775,"Oh, they back in Stockton, ma'am."
00:11:32.858,00:11:34.735,California. That's where I was raised.
00:11:35.236,00:11:37.780,I figured they got plenty of mouths to feed as it is.
00:11:38.656,00:11:42.743,"Not that I care a fig about material things, you know, except for maybe a decent car."
00:11:43.869,00:11:47.832,"See, us thumb-slummers and box-jumpers, we get a little peckish when it comes to cars, you know?"
00:11:47.915,00:11:52.336,"That boy sound just like Doughboy Hawkins, a fella I met in the Dust Bowl."
00:11:52.420,00:11:56.048,"Tell you what I think. I think it's 1959, and this boy's singing songs about the boxcar?"
00:11:56.132,00:11:58.676,Hmm. What a boxcar gonna mean to him?
00:11:58.759,00:12:02.555,"Right here, we got race riots, folks with no food."
00:12:02.638,00:12:03.848,Why ain't he out there singing about that?
00:12:03.931,00:12:05.224,The boy a guest in our house.
00:12:05.307,00:12:07.351,I know he's a guest. I'm just trying to speak what's in my mind.
00:12:12.189,00:12:13.149,Say it.
00:12:20.114,00:12:21.615,"Live your own time, child."
00:12:23.701,00:12:24.994,Sing about your own time.
00:12:36.172,00:12:47.057,"once the in spot for beatnik jazz and bebop, is today home to the popular folk music fad, a do-it-yourself musical expression that's attracted youngsters from all across the nation."
00:12:47.141,00:12:55.691,"For them, these homespun songs of the working man express a truth and candor sorely lacking in today's growing consumer society."
00:12:55.774,00:12:58.944,Why do you prefer folk music to other types of music?
00:12:59.028,00:13:00.946,Because it's honest.
00:13:01.989,00:13:04.783,"Commercial songs, pop music can't be honest."
00:13:04.867,00:13:09.413,It's controlled and censored by the people who run society and make the rules.
00:13:09.497,00:13:17.296,"Yet, among the many new and talented artists to emerge, one name stands alone as the heart and soul of this growing musical trend."
00:13:17.379,00:13:27.848,"A young individual who both writes and performs some of his era's finest tunes, and hailed by the New York Times as folk music's Troubadour of Conscience."
00:13:27.932,00:13:29.850,His name is Jack Rollins.
00:13:33.938,00:13:38.609,"folk sensation of the early '60s, was the promise of a new generation."
00:13:38.692,00:13:47.243,"So what was it that made him run at the height of his career and throw it all away, trading in the limelight for a different kind of light altogether?"
00:13:47.326,00:13:53.999,"He saw what was going on in the world, and he had the ability to distill it into a song."
00:13:54.083,00:13:56.210,He could do a funny thing.
00:13:56.293,00:13:58.629,He could do a pathos thing. He was sensational.
00:14:06.303,00:14:17.231,"Now, this young man has taken to the hearts of young people who seem to somehow identify with, uh… Jack, why do you think that is?"
00:14:17.314,00:14:19.483,"Well, I don't know."
00:14:19.567,00:14:31.787,"I… I guess… I got a lot of thoughts inside of me, and most people, they… they… keep them all inside."
00:14:31.871,00:14:35.332,And I guess it's for them that I do what I do.
00:14:37.418,00:14:44.258,"might best be remembered as the tortured singer battling his conscience in the 1965 drama, Grain of Sand."
00:14:44.341,00:14:48.137,"The role, of course, that launched the career of Hollywood rebel Robbie Clark."
00:14:48.220,00:14:51.015,"Hell, I don't pick what I sing. It picks me."
00:14:51.807,00:14:53.100,Some of it ain't pretty.
00:14:53.183,00:14:56.520,"I mean, how you ever gonna change anything if you only wanna show what's pretty?"
00:14:56.604,00:15:05.195,"In his first exclusive interview in 20 years… Tonight, we bring you face-to-face with the real Jack Rollins."
00:15:21.211,00:15:24.840,and he had the ability to distill it into a song.
00:15:24.924,00:15:26.717,And this elevated the discussion.
00:15:26.800,00:15:32.640,"I mean, certainly within the folk world, but all through popular music, the bar had risen."
00:15:33.974,00:15:42.441,"was herself a leading figure in the folk revival, achieving international success a few years before their first meeting in 1962."
00:15:43.275,00:15:45.277,"Hey, you're in my chair."
00:15:47.655,00:15:57.122,"I was at a party in the Village, and this twerpy little kid who'd been hanging around, kind of flirting with my baby sister and kissing up to me, starts playing these songs that he'd written on guitar."
00:15:57.206,00:16:10.094,"Now, this was '61, '62, and all anybody sang were traditionals, and here's this kid, applying traditional form to contemporary concerns, but with such insight, you know?"
00:16:10.177,00:16:11.595,It was devastating.
00:16:11.679,00:16:14.723,You couldn't believe this was coming out of this little toad.
00:16:14.807,00:16:18.394,Nobody was writing songs like that.
00:16:18.477,00:16:24.066,It was as if he was giving voice to ideas that I wanted to express but didn't know how.
00:16:24.149,00:16:26.735,"Um, his finger-pointing songs, he called 'em."
00:16:26.819,00:16:30.030,He was churning them out like ticker tape.
00:16:30.864,00:16:41.917,"Well, folk music has always been a political music, but he was really expressing it as an art form in a way that was multileveled and very deep."
00:17:19.621,00:17:25.878,call this ragamuffin on stage and introduce America to Jack Rollins.
00:17:25.961,00:17:35.012,"I'd say, you know, that he has something to say, you know, and that he is… he is speaking for me and everybody who wants a better world."
00:17:56.116,00:17:59.703,His songs are like a true vision of how things really are.
00:18:02.289,00:18:05.793,and aware insight working today.
00:18:05.876,00:18:09.046,"You'd have thought we invented it, we were so pleased and proud."
00:18:13.759,00:18:22.559,"Sure, there was a certain tendency in the folk movement for nostalgia about the Depression and the radicalism that came out of it."
00:18:23.227,00:18:27.106,"They were coming out of a shitty time… the McCarthy era, Eisenhower era."
00:18:27.189,00:18:34.071,"So, as long as folk remained strictly a minority taste, it would always be us against the big, bad commercial tastelessness."
00:18:34.154,00:18:44.581,"But when the big, bad commercial tastelessness finally caught on to Jack, then, well, all of a sudden, the race was on."
00:18:45.749,00:18:47.835,"And this time, somebody was going to win."
00:18:47.918,00:18:49.002,He was a rebel.
00:18:49.086,00:18:50.921,I wanted to record protest.
00:18:51.004,00:18:54.591,"Of course, that's right when we were getting into that whole Nam business."
00:18:54.675,00:18:59.096,Jack really stopped protesting after 1963.
00:18:59.179,00:19:02.224,He said that you couldn't effect change with a song.
00:19:03.517,00:19:10.649,"You could only write about what was inside you, and folk music, he said, was, um… was fat people."
00:19:11.733,00:19:17.114,"He said it made him feel like the Establishment, you know, and he always fought the Establishment."
00:20:00.449,00:20:01.325,to be a poet.
00:20:01.867,00:20:03.368,Some work in gas stations.
00:20:03.911,00:20:05.162,Some shine shoes.
00:20:08.582,00:20:11.293,"I don't really call myself one, 'cause I don't like the word."
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.088,"Me, I'm a trapeze artist."
00:20:17.049,00:20:24.014,"Sighting it and hearing it and breathing it in, rubbing it all in the pores of my skin."
00:20:24.097,00:20:28.185,And the wind between my eyes knocking honey in my comb.
00:20:35.609,00:20:37.819,I ain't doing nothing!
00:20:39.154,00:20:40.364,Now look what you done!
00:20:41.531,00:20:42.991,You talk English?
00:20:44.743,00:20:47.329,"-Yes, sir. -You carrying money, boy?"
00:20:47.412,00:20:48.330,Weapons?
00:20:48.413,00:20:49.456,"N-No, sir."
00:20:49.539,00:20:51.083,He's lying.
00:20:51.166,00:20:54.753,What's that? That your fiddle? Huh?
00:20:54.836,00:20:56.004,-Give it back. -Huh?
00:20:56.088,00:20:57.714,What's it say on that thing?
00:20:59.341,00:21:01.301,What you got stashed in here?
00:21:01.385,00:21:03.011,Nothing!
00:21:03.095,00:21:04.096,"Get him, boys!"
00:21:04.596,00:21:05.847,Ahh!
00:21:09.184,00:21:28.996,"Ah, you little… Give me… This here young'un, the Tiny Troubadour, is going to sing a little song."
00:21:29.079,00:21:31.498,So what bring you around these parts?
00:21:31.581,00:21:33.542,Could've sworn he was an older man.
00:21:33.625,00:21:35.127,"Live your own time, child."
00:21:35.210,00:21:36.128,"Get him, boys!"
00:21:36.211,00:21:38.213,You reckon he's some kind of midget?
00:21:38.297,00:21:40.132,He's lying!
00:21:42.592,00:21:43.760,I dreamed of the Crusades.
00:21:45.887,00:21:47.347,Republics without history.
00:21:49.391,00:21:50.976,Secret religious wars.
00:21:52.394,00:21:54.271,I believed in every kind of witchcraft.
00:21:56.148,00:21:57.941,"At first, it was a study."
00:21:58.942,00:22:01.069,I wrote out silences and nights.
00:22:02.195,00:22:04.114,"Later, I determined vertigos."
00:22:36.229,00:22:38.690,"bullet-shooting machine guns, and 80 soldiers."
00:22:47.532,00:22:49.493,I just don't want to go.
00:22:50.535,00:22:54.122,"Oh, my poor, sad little thing."
00:22:55.916,00:23:01.379,Do you know what a wonderful time you're going to have… on a boat with the water?
00:23:02.005,00:23:04.174,Sounds pretty neat what your daddy's planned.
00:23:04.257,00:23:06.134,Me too!
00:23:08.136,00:23:10.097,Why can't you come?
00:23:10.806,00:23:12.641,"Molly, you know I can't come."
00:23:13.809,00:23:17.646,Is that why… you think you're feeling nervous about the boat?
00:23:18.188,00:23:19.314,Hmm?
00:23:19.397,00:23:21.149,When's Daddy coming?
00:23:22.109,00:23:24.319,"Uh, Saturday, I think."
00:23:24.402,00:23:27.989,I only spoke to Sally because it's impossible to get your father on the phone.
00:23:30.033,00:23:31.326,It's Emily.
00:23:31.409,00:23:32.869,"Molly, you didn't eat a thing."
00:23:42.212,00:23:43.672,How may I direct your call?
00:23:58.395,00:24:01.356,Robbie… how can you whistle?
00:24:02.941,00:24:04.234,Who was that on the phone?
00:24:07.779,00:24:13.702,"of what he will say to Vice President Agnew, to the Cabinet, and to the leaders of Congress."
00:24:13.785,00:24:16.413,"Now, here is the president."
00:24:18.206,00:24:31.678,and television time tonight for the purpose of announcing that we today have concluded an agreement to end the war and bring peace with honor in Vietnam and in southeast Asia.
00:24:32.262,00:24:36.641,The following statement is being issued at this moment in Washington and Hanoi.
00:24:36.725,00:24:57.329,"At 12:30 Paris time today, January 23, 1973… The longest-running war in television history."
00:25:00.665,00:25:04.794,The war that hung like a shadow over the same nine years as her marriage.
00:25:05.295,00:25:09.591,"Throughout the years of negotiations, we have insisted on peace with honor."
00:26:01.017,00:26:03.853,And… cut! Check the gate.
00:26:03.937,00:26:07.983,"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank each and every one of you."
00:26:08.066,00:26:09.776,You made it marvelous for me.
00:26:10.527,00:26:11.528,Cheers to all of you.
00:26:13.071,00:26:16.324,"Hey, Louise! Louise!"
00:26:23.707,00:26:30.588,"actor Robbie Clark is finally heading home after four months abroad during the filming of Gangplank, his upcoming thriller."
00:26:30.672,00:26:36.803,"Rumors linking Clark to his London co-star, the lovely newcomer Louise Pickering, have been brewing for some time."
00:27:33.401,00:27:35.945,"It's not about me anymore, it's all about him."
00:27:36.029,00:27:40.367,"Your guaranteed, double-your-money-back voice of the people."
00:27:41.034,00:27:42.410,You didn't answer my question.
00:27:43.661,00:27:50.377,"Once, maybe, you could sing about Mary Hamilton and lemon trees, or you can step out like me and try and shake this flytrap."
00:27:57.008,00:27:58.676,I was a pawn in their game.
00:28:21.908,00:28:24.661,in January of '64 in the Village.
00:28:26.121,00:28:27.705,They'd just buried their president.
00:28:30.875,00:28:32.168,Love was in the air.
00:28:32.919,00:28:35.380,"-Wait, you're French? -Yeah, so?"
00:28:35.463,00:28:37.590,"-Well, you gotta be kidding me. -Why?"
00:28:37.674,00:28:40.093,"No, nothing. It's perfect. You kidding?"
00:28:42.887,00:28:44.305,I think you're making a joke.
00:28:44.389,00:28:45.515,"Oh, no. No, no, no."
00:28:45.598,00:28:47.016,No joke.
00:28:48.226,00:28:51.563,Then what else aside from being French you like so much about me?
00:28:51.646,00:28:55.108,"Your hair, your mouth, your eyes, your lips."
00:29:00.196,00:29:01.364,I see.
00:29:02.699,00:29:05.785,"So, um… You're an actor."
00:29:06.286,00:29:08.037,"Yeah, yeah. So?"
00:29:10.457,00:29:12.459,I like what you said in that scene.
00:29:13.418,00:29:14.878,"Uh, what scene?"
00:29:14.961,00:29:16.629,But they were just lines from a movie.
00:29:16.713,00:29:18.548,"-They were not… -Wait, wait, wait. What scene?"
00:29:18.631,00:29:21.259,-What did you see? -The scene in the lane.
00:29:21.342,00:29:22.302,Hmm.
00:29:23.052,00:29:27.140,I would like to know what is at the center of your world.
00:29:29.851,00:29:33.730,"Uh… Well, you're no monkeying around."
00:29:33.813,00:29:35.356,Why?
00:29:35.440,00:29:37.484,"It's very simple, this question."
00:29:41.112,00:29:43.823,"Well, I'm 22. I guess I would say me."
00:29:47.827,00:29:49.287,I suppose you're honest.
00:29:49.370,00:29:55.752,"Well, don't you think that you're the center or that you should be the center, thinking with your own head, talking with your own mouth?"
00:29:56.461,00:29:57.921,Yeah.
00:29:58.004,00:30:00.965,"But there are things in the world, too, that are important."
00:30:01.049,00:30:02.509,I'm not denying that.
00:30:02.592,00:30:03.968,That's not what I'm saying.
00:30:06.679,00:30:08.348,"Okay, thank you."
00:30:20.902,00:30:29.285,Congress grants President Johnson complete authority over the war in Vietnam while she studies painting at Cooper Union and he completes dubbing on his first major film.
00:30:32.205,00:30:34.165,She tells him she's sure it'll be a hit.
00:30:38.503,00:30:47.053,"And the cats cross the roof, mad in love, scream into drainpipes, and it's I who am ready."
00:30:47.136,00:30:48.054,Ready to listen.
00:30:48.763,00:30:52.141,"Never tired, never sad, never guilty."
00:32:26.653,00:32:28.863,Watch it! It's not a fucking can of tomatoes.
00:32:54.597,00:32:55.974,"Okay, come on, let's go."
00:33:01.020,00:33:03.022,"It is my bike, you know."
00:33:03.106,00:33:04.148,Of course it is.
00:33:12.949,00:33:16.452,"All right, here we go. Watch your leg."
00:33:19.872,00:33:21.332,"-Change the gear! -I am, I am!"
00:33:21.416,00:33:23.126,"-Change the gear! -Yeah, I know, I know."
00:33:38.808,00:33:45.648,"One should say, 'I am thought.' I is someone else."
00:33:48.484,00:33:51.279,I am present at the birth of my thought.
00:33:51.362,00:33:53.906,I watch and I listen.
00:33:54.532,00:33:56.868,I draw a stroke of the bow.
00:33:57.618,00:34:03.583,"A symphony stirs in the depths, or comes with a leap to the stage."
00:34:04.417,00:34:36.741,"It began with waves of disgust and it ends… as we can't immediately seize this eternity, it ends with a riot of perfumes.  and Robbie Clark, the new James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Jack Kerouac all rolled into one."
00:34:37.492,00:34:39.410,But the movie disappointed her.
00:34:39.494,00:34:44.123,"The more they tried to make it youthful, the more the images on screen seemed out of date."
00:34:44.207,00:34:51.130,"It wasn't the film they had dreamed, the film they had imagined and discussed, the film they each wanted to live."
00:35:00.765,00:35:02.809,Amazing endocrine system.
00:35:03.392,00:35:06.646,"-So, he'll be all right, then? -Oh, he'll be fine."
00:35:06.729,00:35:09.857,"-Just a little water in the lungs. -Oh, my."
00:35:10.483,00:35:11.651,"Well, what do you know?"
00:35:12.568,00:35:15.446,Looks like somebody might be able to thank you in person.
00:35:19.117,00:35:22.078,Son? Can you hear me?
00:35:22.662,00:35:23.704,I'm Dr. Field.
00:35:23.788,00:35:26.666,And this here lady pretty near saved your life.
00:35:28.042,00:35:29.293,Hello there.
00:35:30.002,00:35:31.712,I-I'm Mrs. Peacock.
00:35:31.796,00:35:35.133,"My husband and I, we're the ones that found you."
00:36:13.462,00:36:16.340,And no formal training? Remarkable.
00:36:39.280,00:36:40.781,-Just terrific! -Fantastic!
00:36:40.865,00:36:41.991,That was a fine job.
00:36:42.074,00:36:43.743,"-Thank you, thank you. -That's just wonderful."
00:36:43.826,00:36:45.411,How about another helping?
00:36:45.494,00:36:47.580,"-Woody? -Yes, ma'am."
00:36:48.080,00:36:48.956,"More wine, Woody?"
00:36:49.040,00:36:50.333,"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir."
00:36:50.416,00:36:52.043,Do you know what your plans are from here?
00:36:52.543,00:36:59.467,"My only real plan is to become a singer, a real singer on television, either that or a kind of voice of the people, you know?"
00:36:59.550,00:37:00.635,Interesting.
00:37:00.718,00:37:05.348,"Because I've been writing me some songs, songs about what's going on."
00:37:06.057,00:37:09.352,"And I'm going to take these songs, and I'm going to head straight to Hollywood."
00:37:09.435,00:37:12.521,Going to make it big just like Elvis Presley.
00:37:13.606,00:37:15.691,"Well, Woody, I wouldn't be surprised if you did just that."
00:37:15.775,00:37:17.485,"-There you are, Woody. -Thank you."
00:37:17.568,00:37:22.073,"And don't you go rushing off anyplace until you feel 100%, you hear?"
00:37:22.156,00:37:23.241,"Yes, ma'am."
00:37:23.324,00:37:26.160,Have to mother you while you still have a roof over your head.
00:37:28.079,00:37:29.080,Who on earth?
00:37:29.914,00:37:32.041,-Are you expecting a call? -No.
00:37:34.168,00:37:35.253,"So, Hollywood?"
00:37:35.336,00:37:37.338,-Hello? -Not Tin Pan Alley?
00:37:37.421,00:37:39.131,"Yes, it is. Who's calling?"
00:37:42.218,00:37:47.014,"Well, how could… Dr. Field, yes."
00:37:47.640,00:37:50.268,"Would you hold on just a moment, please?"
00:37:50.351,00:37:51.435,Esther?
00:37:51.519,00:37:54.522,It's a juvenile center in Minnesota.
00:37:54.605,00:37:55.523,A what?
00:37:55.606,00:37:57.817,Something… Corrections.
00:37:57.900,00:37:59.235,"You talk to 'em, Jack."
00:38:00.695,00:38:01.988,They think it's Woody.
00:38:02.655,00:38:03.990,What do they know about Woody?
00:38:04.991,00:38:13.040,"They said they're looking for some… a juvenile, but… some state, you know, fugitive."
00:38:14.250,00:38:16.210,Certainly not Woody.
00:38:36.814,00:38:42.987,and looked way down across plenty o' sights in all their veiled and nakedest seasons.
00:38:44.447,00:38:50.703,"Sighting it, hearing it, seeing and feeling and breathing it in."
00:38:53.664,00:38:55.082,Sucking down on it.
00:38:56.083,00:39:03.007,"Rubbing it all in the pores of my skin, and the wind between my eyes knocking honey in my comb."
00:39:05.259,00:39:06.093,Whoa.
00:39:46.425,00:39:47.468,May I help you?
00:39:48.511,00:39:50.388,Flowers for Mr. Guthrie.
00:39:50.471,00:39:53.432,"-Room 300. Just set 'em inside. -Thank you, ma'am."
00:41:18.642,00:41:22.688,"Kennedy's funeral was on TV, And we were sitting outside."
00:41:22.771,00:41:23.981,You could hear it.
00:41:24.064,00:41:29.820,I was pulling up chunks of grass with my fist and feeling like we were splitting apart.
00:41:29.904,00:41:34.575,"And… And, yeah, I asked him what did he think made us so different?"
00:41:34.658,00:41:37.077,And he said it was simple.
00:41:37.161,00:41:41.707,"You know, I thought that I could change things, and he knew that no one could."
00:41:41.790,00:41:43.292,"You know, look at Kennedy."
00:41:50.674,00:41:55.179,where Jack received the Civil Rights Award and drank three vats of wine for the trouble.
00:41:57.515,00:42:01.977,"I wanna accept this on behalf of, uh, everybody that went down to Cuba."
00:42:04.146,00:42:07.066,"First of all, because you're all young, you know?"
00:42:07.149,00:42:11.570,"And it's took me a long time to get young, and now I consider myself young."
00:42:11.654,00:42:14.657,And I'm proud of it.
00:42:14.740,00:42:17.326,It ain't old people's world out there.
00:42:17.409,00:42:20.996,"I mean, you all shouldn't even be here."
00:42:24.500,00:42:27.628,I mean… it's not like before.
00:42:27.711,00:42:32.508,"There's no black or white, no more left wing, right wing, you know?"
00:42:32.591,00:42:50.693,"There's up wing and there's down wing, which is why I think that, you know, this man who shot President Kennedy, this Lee Oswald, I think I saw something that… that he felt… in me."
00:42:56.532,00:42:59.201,"You can boo, but booing's got nothing to do with it!"
00:42:59.994,00:43:03.163,"They didn't understand me, you know, because they got mind blinders on."
00:43:03.247,00:43:05.666,All they see is the cause and how they use people for their cause.
00:43:05.749,00:43:06.875,And now they're trying to use me for something.
00:43:06.959,00:43:16.427,"They want me to… want me to carry a picket sign and have my picture taken, be a good little nigger, you know, and not mess up their little game."
00:43:16.927,00:43:18.846,All they want from me is finger-pointing songs.
00:43:20.889,00:43:22.433,I only got ten fingers.
00:43:25.311,00:43:27.146,was sitting in that room that night.
00:43:28.022,00:43:29.898,"A week later, he issued a formal apology."
00:43:33.152,00:43:37.865,"thinking that something's expected of you, but you don't know exactly what it is."
00:43:39.533,00:43:42.202,Brings forth a weird kind of guilt.
00:44:01.930,00:44:03.766,Little Richard was becoming a preacher.
00:44:04.642,00:44:10.230,"So, whether you were a folk singer or a Christian, rock and roll was the devil."
00:44:14.318,00:44:18.739,"Me, I was in a ditch, up a cliff, out of step, ready to quit."
00:44:21.075,00:44:24.995,I wrote the kind of stuff you write when you have no place to live and you're wrapped up in the fire pump.
00:44:35.381,00:44:36.507,And then I wrote it.
00:44:38.759,00:44:40.260,It was like swimming in lava.
00:44:42.012,00:44:51.563,"Skipping, kicking, catching a nail with your foot, seeing your victim hanging from a tree."
00:45:03.200,00:45:23.178,"is a person who has, in a sense, changed the face of American folk music… Ladies and gentlemen, the person who's coming out now… …is a legend in his time."
00:45:24.221,00:45:26.640,And his name is Jude Quinn!
00:46:00.966,00:46:02.593,I want that volume down now!
00:46:02.676,00:46:03.886,I can't turn the volume down!
00:46:03.969,00:46:07.014,"-I can't even hear the words! -Hey, man… Hey what's wrong?"
00:46:07.097,00:46:08.348,"Man, what are you going to do?"
00:46:08.432,00:46:09.641,What are you going to do up there?
00:46:09.725,00:46:12.728,I'm going to cut the goddamn… lead!
00:46:46.720,00:46:50.682,"Sorry for everything I've done, and, uh, I hope to remedy it soon."
00:46:51.683,00:46:52.893,-Shit! Garbage! -Crap!
00:46:52.976,00:46:54.311,-J'accuse! -J'accuse!
00:46:54.394,00:47:06.365,"Ah, it's just like he's trying to conform to some sort of popular taste with this incredibly corny group behind him, but he's just… he's just prostituting himself."
00:47:07.074,00:47:09.201,He's… He's just changed completely.
00:47:09.826,00:47:11.787,He's changed from what he was.
00:47:12.579,00:47:15.249,He's not the same as he was at first.
00:47:15.332,00:47:18.460,Nothing but a fake neurotic crawling through the gutter.
00:47:18.544,00:47:26.510,"If that is the way he walks through a gutter, I would rather walk with my head up through a gutter than like him, crawling through the bloody gutter, just making a pile out of it!"
00:47:26.593,00:47:27.970,That's what he is doing!
00:47:28.053,00:47:30.264,He is just making a pile out of it!
00:47:31.682,00:47:34.476,I kinda liked getting blasted out of my skin.
00:47:35.602,00:47:37.396,I think he's evil.
00:47:38.605,00:47:40.148,And we were his biggest fans.
00:48:25.694,00:48:27.279,but a brand-new way of telling it like it is.
00:48:27.362,00:48:29.156,And Jude Quinn is definitely what's happening.
00:48:29.239,00:48:30.449,Here he comes now.
00:48:30.532,00:48:31.783,Mr. Quinn! Mr. Quinn!
00:48:31.867,00:48:33.660,Have you got a word for your fans?
00:48:33.744,00:48:35.329,"Uh, astronaut."
00:48:50.969,00:48:52.596,-Mr. Quinn! -Mr. Quinn!
00:48:52.679,00:48:54.806,-Over here! -Mr. Quinn!
00:48:55.390,00:48:56.391,"-Yes? -Look over here, Jude!"
00:48:57.809,00:49:01.188,Why do you think you were booed at your recent appearance in New England?
00:49:05.150,00:49:07.986,I figure there's a little boo in all of us.
00:49:08.070,00:49:09.154,"-Jude! -Mr. Quinn, Mr. Quinn!"
00:49:09.237,00:49:11.365,Is it true you no longer sing protest songs?
00:49:11.448,00:49:13.617,-Who said that? -I didn't say that.
00:49:13.700,00:49:17.287,"I was just, uh… I read somewhere that you no longer do the protesting."
00:49:18.538,00:49:23.001,"Well, that's all I ever do is protest."
00:49:24.586,00:49:25.587,Do you have a message?
00:49:26.880,00:49:27.964,Do you?
00:49:30.050,00:49:31.677,Am I trying to accomplish anything?
00:49:32.344,00:49:34.388,Are you trying to change the world or anything?
00:49:34.471,00:49:42.646,"What, am I trying to change the word, did you say? Is… -No. -Excuse me, Mr. Quinn."
00:49:43.355,00:49:45.691,Perhaps you could tell us… Do you have a match?
00:49:45.774,00:49:51.363,…how many people who labor in the same musical vineyards in which you toil… That's very pretty.
00:49:54.616,00:49:58.954,"That is, people who protest against the social state we live in?"
00:50:04.334,00:50:23.937,"Yeah, um… As someone symbolic of the protest movement among young people, some have questioned, given your latest recordings, whether or not you still care about people as you once did."
00:50:25.480,00:50:31.236,"Yeah, but, you know, we all have our own definitions of all those words."
00:50:32.904,00:50:49.588,"Care and people… Well, is it your belief, then, that folk music has, perchance, failed to achieve its goals with the Negro cause or the cause of peace?"
00:50:49.671,00:50:56.928,"You know, saying cause of peace is just like saying… like a hunk of butter."
00:50:59.556,00:51:03.059,who wants you to believe is dedicated to the hunk and not the butter.
00:51:03.143,00:51:04.519,I'm not sure I follow.
00:51:05.437,00:51:08.940,"You know, I didn't come out of some cereal box."
00:51:09.983,00:51:13.528,There's… There's no one out there who's ever going to be converted by a song.
00:51:13.612,00:51:21.203,There's no Phil Ochs song that's going to keep a movement moving nor the picket line picketing.
00:51:21.286,00:51:27.501,"His songs are acts of personal conscience, like burning a draft card or burning yourself."
00:51:28.460,00:51:34.800,Doesn't do a damn thing except disassociate you and your audience from all the evils of the world.
00:51:35.592,00:51:37.552,I refuse to be disassociated from that.
00:51:42.933,00:51:45.519,sitting around being offended by their own meaninglessness.
00:51:46.770,00:51:50.649,I'm asking for your goddamn hotel security to keep these assholes out of the lobby.
00:51:50.732,00:51:53.527,What? What?
00:51:53.610,00:52:00.325,"And you, sir, are one of the dumbest assholes and most stupid persons I've ever spoken to in my life, understand? What?"
00:52:01.368,00:52:02.953,"Well, I certainly hope so."
00:52:05.247,00:52:06.164,Meaningless is right.
00:52:06.248,00:52:09.793,Do you think the average cat who works eight hours a day gives a tit what I do?
00:52:11.169,00:52:16.383,"Anyway, it's not going to keep me in heaven or out of the fiery furnace, that's for sure."
00:52:17.092,00:52:18.635,Not gonna make me happy.
00:52:19.177,00:52:20.220,Let me see that.
00:52:25.684,00:52:28.019,"Whoa, there she is again, your little debutante."
00:52:28.103,00:52:29.271,"No way, man."
00:52:29.980,00:52:32.816,Is that Andy's new bird? Coco something?
00:52:32.899,00:52:33.900,Rivington.
00:52:33.984,00:52:37.904,"Coco Rivington Rockefeller, Mrs. Howell III."
00:52:38.405,00:52:40.782,"She's queen of the underground, and I don't mean tube."
00:52:41.533,00:52:42.742,She's got good style.
00:52:45.161,00:52:47.080,-I'd ball her. -Be my guest.
00:52:47.163,00:52:50.000,"I think she's even here in, uh, London."
00:52:50.083,00:52:51.084,She's here?
00:52:51.167,00:52:53.086,"So you dated her, did you?"
00:52:53.169,00:52:54.880,Never. That girl's trouble.
00:52:54.963,00:52:57.007,Will you invite her to the party?
00:52:57.090,00:52:59.509,Sure. I always invite trouble.
00:53:53.104,00:53:56.983,"If it's that fucking concierge again, I swear to God… Yeah, who is it?"
00:54:00.195,00:54:01.780,different numbers if they want this to work.
00:54:02.822,00:54:06.868,No. Stu… I'm not going to talk about this all goddamn day.
00:54:06.952,00:54:10.330,"Puffing heavily on his cigarette, he smokes 80 a day."
00:54:12.082,00:54:14.376,God. I'm glad I'm not me.
00:54:15.877,00:54:18.213,Hey! I've got something to say to you.
00:54:18.296,00:54:19.756,"-Whoa! -Hey, fuck off!"
00:54:19.839,00:54:22.008,"-It's him I'm talkin' at. -Yeah, I'm listenin', man."
00:54:22.092,00:54:24.344,"-Traitor! You wanker! -Listen, pal."
00:54:24.427,00:54:26.680,"If you know what's good for you, turn right around and get the fuck out of here."
00:54:26.763,00:54:27.806,-Come on. -Hey!
00:54:29.557,00:54:30.600,Hurry up.
00:54:30.684,00:54:32.936,"Jason! You got to get in here, man. You better hurry."
00:54:33.436,00:54:36.648,-It's your boy I want. -Put that knife down. You hear me?
00:54:37.816,00:54:39.234,"-Hey, man. -Jesus Christ."
00:54:39.317,00:54:41.945,Are you out of your fuckin' mind? What are you gonna do? Stab us all?
00:54:42.028,00:54:44.364,It's his fault! He's the one.
00:54:44.447,00:54:45.740,Stabbing truth in the eye.
00:54:45.824,00:54:47.617,"I'm listening. What's the truth, man?"
00:54:47.701,00:54:52.163,"Easy, easy, easy. Now just put that down… -No! -Walk away."
00:54:52.247,00:54:53.790,"-Just relax. -Hey, back up."
00:54:54.332,00:54:56.209,"Either be groovy or leave, man."
00:55:03.883,00:55:05.176,-Is he okay? -Yeah.
00:55:05.260,00:55:06.136,Everybody all right?
00:55:07.303,00:55:10.348,-Thanks for steppin' in. -My pleasure.
00:56:15.789,00:56:17.582,Hang on a second. Am I shitting you?
00:56:18.583,00:56:21.836,"-Dirty son of a gun. -Claire, this is Sidney Green."
00:56:21.920,00:56:23.588,A very bad old friend of mine.
00:56:24.089,00:56:25.131,Hello.
00:56:25.632,00:56:27.467,She's a doll. Actress?
00:56:27.550,00:56:30.011,"Uh, no, a painter. She's unbelievable."
00:56:30.095,00:56:31.387,And Sid's a collector.
00:56:31.471,00:56:32.806,"What do you paint, honey?"
00:56:33.515,00:56:38.853,"Oh, they're… They're abstracts, -most of what I do. -She's French?"
00:56:38.937,00:56:40.271,"Aw, for cryin' out loud."
00:56:41.314,00:56:44.526,"Oh, oh. It's Mailer."
00:56:49.823,00:56:51.157,"Abstracts, huh?"
00:57:41.708,00:57:44.210,is what terrifies people most.
00:58:03.104,00:58:05.273,"If he said he'll be here, he'll be here."
00:58:05.356,00:58:07.609,It's just such a terribly important booking.
00:58:08.151,00:58:09.694,Keenan seldom interviews.
00:58:09.777,00:58:14.365,"He's really more of an opinion maker really, on the telly, so, there's apt to be no time at all."
00:58:14.949,00:58:17.076,Is there a handler? Someone who looks after him?
00:58:17.660,00:58:22.707,"I told you, he and John and Paul and George… Yes, but did he ever get back?"
00:58:23.500,00:58:25.376,-Pardon me. -What?
00:58:25.460,00:58:27.962,Do you know if Jude Quinn is in attendance?
00:58:28.046,00:58:29.088,The country-western singer?
00:58:29.172,00:58:30.965,"No time for autographs, dearie."
00:58:32.967,00:58:34.969,-What's that over there? -Where?
00:58:39.182,00:58:41.100,"Do the Watusi, John!"
00:58:43.811,00:58:44.687,Whoa!
00:58:47.065,00:58:48.149,Mr. Quinn?
00:58:48.650,00:58:50.318,"Mr. Quinn, yoo-hoo."
00:58:52.237,00:58:55.823,"Yes, Mr. Quinn, hello! We're all just here at the car. No worries."
00:58:57.158,00:58:59.744,Good. Sayonara.
00:59:06.709,00:59:07.961,Mother. Mother.
00:59:08.044,00:59:15.718,"Oh, Mr. Quinn! What a privilege to have in our midst a true visionary, and such a splendid example to the youth."
00:59:15.802,00:59:19.305,And such marvelous songs. So truly wonderful.
00:59:19.389,00:59:22.767,"-Howdy. -Our dear friend, Carolyn Hester, the folk singer?"
00:59:22.850,00:59:28.106,"She was saying, just the other day, how liberating -what you're doing really is for all-- -Mr. Quinn, hello!"
00:59:28.189,00:59:30.316,"Ma'am, I'm terribly sorry."
00:59:30.400,00:59:35.321,"Carolyn said that? You tell Carolyn to come see me anytime, now that she's, uh, liberated."
00:59:35.405,00:59:43.204,"Jude, you know, like in the song Generation Dungeon, when you say he has the eyes of a camel and sleeps on a hook, -That's Victor, right? -Mr. Quinn!"
00:59:43.288,00:59:50.169,"'Cause I saw a picture of him once in a magazine, smoking Camels, which I know Danny Ronk used to smoke, but then he switched to Lucky Strikes in '64."
00:59:50.253,00:59:52.797,"Mr. Quinn, we really ought to hurry. Everyone's at the car!"
00:59:52.880,00:59:56.217,"-…till early '65. -Norman, Mona, Sammy… Sammy? Who's Sammy?"
00:59:57.218,00:59:59.846,Sonny. Sonny Dover.
00:59:59.929,01:00:04.100,"The central doyen of the inner circle, and Jude's oldest ally."
01:00:04.183,01:00:06.352,He plays maracas on Medicine Sunday.
01:00:06.436,01:00:08.980,Judey! Lover boy! Ah!
01:00:10.315,01:00:13.526,"Two words on Shakespeare, Mr. Quinn, for our listeners."
01:00:13.610,01:00:14.736,Two words?
01:00:16.112,01:00:19.991,"Raving queen, and cosmic amphetamine brain."
01:00:20.074,01:00:21.701,I dig Shakespeare.
01:00:22.201,01:00:23.661,I have a question for Mr. Quinn.
01:00:23.745,01:00:30.001,"Oh, Keenan, please forgive us. Mr. Quinn, allow me to introduce to you Mr. Keenan Jones, arts editor and host of the BBC."
01:00:30.084,01:00:31.502,I remember you.
01:00:31.586,01:00:36.591,"Yes, I was going to ask Mr. Quinn why he insists on putting us and the rest of the world on so?"
01:00:37.133,01:00:39.677,Some might be persuaded to doubt his sincerity.
01:00:40.678,01:00:42.388,"Well, who said I was sincere?"
01:00:44.182,01:00:46.017,Are you saying you're not sincere?
01:00:47.101,01:00:49.604,"No more than you, you know?"
01:00:49.687,01:00:51.022,No more sincere than you are.
01:00:53.858,01:00:57.028,"See, you just want me to say what you want me to say."
01:01:05.787,01:01:09.415,"nothing can reach those tens of thousands, living by the dollar."
01:01:12.710,01:01:14.295,But you'd be wrong.
01:01:21.010,01:01:24.389,Hey. What are you doin' here?
01:01:28.017,01:01:29.102,You alone?
01:01:30.645,01:01:32.730,"Now, why would that be any concern of yours?"
01:01:33.523,01:01:37.068,"Look, I'm sorry about what happened."
01:01:37.568,01:01:40.488,-Nothing happened. -Fine. Nothing happened.
01:01:42.281,01:01:45.368,"Oh, come on. I was straight with you."
01:01:47.620,01:01:51.749,"Look, I can't recall San Francisco at all."
01:01:51.833,01:01:55.712,"And I can't really remember El Paso, but you shouldn't take it all so personal."
01:01:59.298,01:02:02.427,My current situation far precedes anything from the past.
01:02:03.553,01:02:06.097,But you never know how the past will turn out.
01:02:08.516,01:02:10.893,But your kisses are nothing like his.
01:02:10.977,01:02:11.853,I bet.
01:02:12.895,01:02:15.314,-Anyone I know? -Good one.
01:02:15.857,01:02:18.651,"No, your lucky tongue will not decay me."
01:02:19.652,01:02:24.449,"Fine, you take your glands, and your medallions, and make love for once, freely."
01:02:24.532,01:02:26.951,So that's what you think you have over everyone.
01:02:35.334,01:02:37.462,I just got to clean up a little bit.
01:02:39.881,01:02:41.132,And I'll be fine.
01:02:41.799,01:02:43.885,Here's a tip: Use your fists.
01:03:03.821,01:03:06.365,"You look and sound very tired, very ill."
01:03:06.449,01:03:09.368,-Is this your normal state? -I take that as an insult.
01:03:10.453,01:03:14.499,"Do you suffer from sore eyes, groovy foreheads, and curly hair?"
01:03:17.335,01:03:20.713,"Hey. Hey, isn't that what's-his-name, the poet?"
01:03:20.797,01:03:23.049,-Ginsberg? -Allen Ginsberg?
01:03:24.467,01:03:26.052,"Oh, my God! It is!"
01:03:26.886,01:03:27.929,Wait a minute.
01:03:35.561,01:03:38.397,Hey! Allen thought that was you in there!
01:03:38.481,01:03:39.732,I don't think you two have met.
01:03:42.109,01:03:43.653,-Hi. -Hey.
01:03:44.487,01:03:48.950,"Allen, tell him what you said to that reporter, the one that asked if you thought that Jude had sold out."
01:03:49.033,01:03:50.284,"What, they're asking you?"
01:03:50.368,01:03:54.413,I said I didn't know. Perhaps you sold out to God.
01:03:55.623,01:03:57.250,What's that even mean?
01:03:58.000,01:04:06.467,"Well, if your mission was to see whether you could do great art on a juke box, well, you know, then we all benefited."
01:04:06.551,01:04:09.512,"Profited, you said, by his coercion."
01:04:11.472,01:04:15.726,That was it. So. What now?
01:04:15.810,01:04:17.979,-Now? -What's left?
01:04:18.646,01:04:21.232,"Oh, my salvation?"
01:04:23.359,01:04:25.653,"Well, see what we could do."
01:04:36.330,01:04:38.416,"That was Allen Ginsberg, man!"
01:04:41.544,01:04:42.962,"See ya later, Allen Ginsberg."
01:04:48.718,01:04:55.182,"of the color discrimination or the war have failed, or as I believe you inferred earlier, do you think it's the process itself that's at fault?"
01:04:55.266,01:04:59.020,Who cares what I think? I'm not the president.
01:04:59.687,01:05:02.565,"I'm not some shepherd. I'm just a storyteller, man."
01:05:02.648,01:05:04.859,"-It's all I am. -Well, certainly."
01:05:04.942,01:05:13.868,"But as someone who once cared deeply, as a storyteller, as… for social justice, equality… certainly you still care as a human being."
01:05:20.917,01:05:22.835,"I mean, why do you care?"
01:05:22.919,01:05:25.838,"If I care, or I don't care, what's it to you?"
01:05:27.048,01:05:31.177,"All right, what if I said I never cared about, you know, folk music?"
01:05:31.260,01:05:35.139,"About, you know, protest songs? It was all about jumping into a scene."
01:05:37.099,01:05:43.648,"You know, I was never gonna stay there. I mean, I just… I knew I could do it better than anybody else."
01:05:43.731,01:05:45.358,"Well, I don't believe you."
01:05:45.441,01:05:49.695,"No, I mean, you know, what matters to me… you know, it matters what's happening now."
01:05:50.446,01:05:58.329,"Does it matter to you when songs you're writing now are being used as recruitment tools for militant street gangs, like the all-Negro faction in the United States?"
01:05:59.538,01:06:02.124,precisely the kind of violence your earlier songs oppose?
01:06:02.208,01:06:06.170,"If you're asking me, man, am I a member of the Black Panther Party, the answer's no."
01:06:10.216,01:06:13.594,"Man, I can't really tell you how I care."
01:06:14.095,01:06:19.141,"Well, I presume at the very least that you care something about what you sing every night."
01:06:20.559,01:06:24.647,"What are you… How can I answer that, if you got the nerve to ask me?"
01:06:25.690,01:06:28.776,"I mean, you've got a lot of nerve, asking me a question like that."
01:06:28.859,01:06:34.490,-Do you ask the Beatles that? -Do I… -Or Mr. Eve of Destruction? -Would you ask Barry McGuire that?
01:06:34.573,01:06:37.201,"I have to ask, because you have the nerve to question whether I care."
01:06:37.284,01:06:39.453,I'm not questioning you because I don't expect any answers from you.
01:06:39.537,01:06:41.414,Maybe Victor Mature. He looks like Victor Mature.
01:06:41.497,01:06:44.709,"More like Elsa Lanchester, man, with a North Mexican kind of thing."
01:06:44.792,01:06:47.253,"That's very protest-y, man. You know, it's very, very protest-y."
01:06:47.336,01:06:52.717,"You know, I am convinced of one thing. You either do care about nothing at all, or tremendously much that people think so."
01:06:54.593,01:06:56.095,And you ask for my time?
01:07:00.266,01:07:03.602,"Listen, I know more about you, right, than you will ever know about me."
01:07:03.686,01:07:07.314,You think I give a crumpet what you write in your lousy paper?
01:07:07.398,01:07:10.568,"Now, I don't need to look to someone else, man, to tell me I'm good."
01:07:10.651,01:07:12.028,"Slaughter me, for all I care."
01:07:12.111,01:07:13.779,I refuse to be hurt.
01:07:19.744,01:07:23.914,"It's clear to anyone how entirely self-conscious you are, in everything you do."
01:07:23.998,01:07:25.791,-That's enough! -Feeling deeply?
01:07:25.875,01:07:27.001,That's what this is about?
01:07:28.544,01:07:32.214,"What precisely, please do tell, am I supposed to be feeling, huh?"
01:07:32.298,01:07:34.383,I'm simply referring to standard emotions.
01:07:34.467,01:07:36.886,"Pain, remorse, love."
01:07:38.763,01:07:40.264,"Yeah, I have none of those feelings."
01:11:38.460,01:11:41.755,"Well, I missed it. I missed it again. I missed it."
01:11:42.631,01:11:46.176,"Bobby, you ain't hearin' me, man. No, we are the geeks. You dig?"
01:11:46.260,01:11:47.845,But then why is that cool?
01:11:47.928,01:11:52.099,"No, man, we are the ones being paraded around like some sort of circus freaks."
01:11:52.182,01:11:55.936,"Come on up and see Harlem, Mr. Jones, but make sure your window's rolled up tight."
01:11:56.020,01:12:01.400,"This song is hell, man. You've got to understand, this song is saying a hell of a lot about society."
01:12:02.151,01:12:04.236,"All power to all people, man, that's what it's saying."
01:12:04.320,01:12:05.571,-I missed it again. -Bobby.
01:12:05.654,01:12:08.907,"Aw, Bobby nothing. Just play it again, Huey. Let's play it one more time."
01:12:43.484,01:12:46.862,"You know, this is music."
01:12:46.945,01:12:50.491,"You know, what you're hearing is not English music, all right?"
01:12:51.784,01:12:54.244,You've never really heard American music before.
01:12:54.953,01:12:58.123,"And what you hear, obviously, right now, doesn't have a name."
01:12:58.665,01:13:00.918,"It's words, all right? And sounds."
01:13:01.752,01:13:03.921,"If it's something you disagree with, that's great."
01:13:06.131,01:13:07.174,Judas!
01:13:13.847,01:13:15.474,I don't believe you.
01:13:20.562,01:13:21.855,Come up here and say that.
01:13:44.837,01:13:46.880,I'm not sure whether it accepts me.
01:13:58.434,01:14:09.403,"I think he was involved with someone, actually… He said something to me on the phone about angels hanging off of buildings, which was frightening."
01:14:10.863,01:14:12.072,I thought he was hallucinating.
01:14:17.119,01:14:24.418,It was like what people say about Billy the Kid… that he really just dodged a bullet and went into hiding.
01:14:25.961,01:14:29.047,"And Jack, he always loved Billy the Kid."
01:14:36.305,01:14:37.306,Henry.
01:14:56.700,01:14:57.993,Stopped me dead.
01:14:58.619,01:15:00.078,That outlaws always die.
01:15:01.955,01:15:04.791,Only a fool would believe what they read in the papers.
01:15:06.335,01:15:07.252,Come on.
01:15:16.386,01:15:20.349,"Here, I'm invisible."
01:15:21.850,01:15:22.851,"Come on, now."
01:15:30.150,01:15:31.276,Even to myself.
01:16:01.014,01:16:02.182,Gettin' everybody zigaboo here.
01:16:04.017,01:16:05.769,Henry. Henry! Henry!
01:16:05.852,01:16:08.689,Come on back here! Henry!
01:16:08.772,01:16:10.148,You get back here!
01:16:12.150,01:16:22.286,"And here, by the road where nobody goes, where it causes no worry, where the show must go on, is where I'll die."
01:16:37.342,01:16:39.469,Henry! Come back here!
01:16:40.137,01:16:42.389,Henry! Come back here!
01:18:17.526,01:18:19.361,Henry! Henry!
01:18:19.444,01:18:20.570,"Goddamn it, get back here!"
01:18:21.154,01:18:23.073,"Hey! Come back, Henry!"
01:18:23.615,01:18:24.700,"Come on, now."
01:18:29.621,01:18:31.039,I couldn't even say.
01:18:33.291,01:18:36.253,The day I arrived looks a lot like today.
01:18:40.173,01:18:42.342,"Least, that's how it seemed at the time."
01:19:08.201,01:19:09.494,"Homer, is that you?"
01:19:10.579,01:19:11.621,Mr. B.
01:19:17.002,01:19:18.211,"What's the trouble, there?"
01:19:19.004,01:19:20.964,A useless bag of thumbs what I am.
01:19:23.133,01:19:24.092,There you go.
01:19:27.387,01:19:28.847,Sellin' off whatnot.
01:19:28.930,01:19:29.931,Mm-hmm.
01:19:31.600,01:19:37.272,"Well, ain't seen no yellow dog runnin' loose by any chance, have you?"
01:19:38.273,01:19:39.691,Old Henry tore off on me.
01:19:40.233,01:19:42.527,"-What, she get spooked? -Seemed to."
01:19:42.611,01:19:44.905,-Why? -Critters know what's goin' on.
01:19:45.405,01:19:49.701,"-What do they know? -Well, for one, they know Shadow Valley's gettin' blown to kingdom come."
01:19:49.785,01:19:53.246,"What, that old highway plan? No, never had a chance."
01:19:54.247,01:19:56.291,"You mean, you really ain't heard?"
01:19:56.374,01:19:57.334,Heard what?
01:19:58.794,01:20:01.713,"Mr. B, that plan's official. It's gone through."
01:20:01.797,01:20:04.132,"Last Tuesday, they all come. Old Man Garrett and them bunch?"
01:20:04.216,01:20:05.675,Wavin' all sorts of papers?
01:20:05.759,01:20:07.719,-I never seen such a stupor. -What are you talkin' about?
01:20:07.803,01:20:11.598,-Wh-What's official? -Six-laner headed straight through the heart of Shadow Valley.
01:20:11.681,01:20:13.809,Commissioner Garrett done give us 30 days come November.
01:20:13.892,01:20:15.101,Why haven't I heard nothing about this?
01:20:16.561,01:20:17.938,"Mr. B, you don't get out much."
01:20:19.773,01:20:22.901,"Don't sound credible to me, Homer."
01:20:24.528,01:20:27.572,What have people been saying? They been doin' anything?
01:20:27.656,01:20:30.075,"Well, first Charley Harper, the zookeeper?"
01:20:30.742,01:20:34.496,Shot hisself in the face in front of them three maiden sisters and two bachelor brothers.
01:20:34.579,01:20:35.997,Them all went insane on account.
01:20:36.498,01:20:42.671,"Been five hangings, six Phenobarbitals, and, well… you familiar with young Clarice Henry?"
01:20:43.547,01:20:45.549,"-Mrs. Henry, the Captain's girl? -Of course I am."
01:20:46.800,01:20:47.759,"Well, what?"
01:20:50.303,01:20:51.304,The Captain found her.
01:20:52.180,01:20:54.516,"Throat cut. By her own hand, they say."
01:20:57.477,01:20:58.687,"Well, where you fixin' to?"
01:21:00.105,01:21:05.861,"Well, if it's true, gonna pay my respects to Captain and Mrs. Henry."
01:21:06.403,01:21:08.864,This whole thing's sounds fishy to me. You comin'?
01:21:09.406,01:21:11.324,"Oh, no. No, not today."
01:21:12.242,01:21:15.579,-Shameful day. -Suit yourself.
01:21:16.371,01:21:22.836,"Anyway, Charley gone, and all of his brothers, who's mindin' the zoo?"
01:21:25.255,01:21:26.339,Homer?
01:21:31.678,01:21:38.977,"America watched its war plan collapse, its cities burn, its youth erupt, its president crumble, its greatest leaders fall slain."
01:21:39.060,01:21:40.520,And there we were.
01:21:41.313,01:21:43.231,All alone with Richard Nixon.
01:21:50.196,01:21:58.330,"All these groups promoting the movement are so full of their own president, vice president, -and secretary bullshit. -Not at all."
01:21:58.413,01:21:59.956,"They just think it's all about them, man."
01:22:00.040,01:22:06.338,"All these right-wing corporate hawks plotting to invade the world, and drug us to death with happy pills and the Bible."
01:22:06.922,01:22:09.049,-It ain't gonna happen. -I never said that.
01:22:09.633,01:22:11.885,What are you talking about? You say it all the time.
01:22:13.970,01:22:32.238,"I don't know. I think we all agree that the world is a terribly fucked-up place, but I happen to feel that there's something to be done to change the situation, and you… don't really sound like you… -He doesn't. -Well… Well, you want to know why you think that?"
01:22:32.948,01:22:35.450,"That, uh, something can be done to change things?"
01:22:35.992,01:22:37.118,Why?
01:22:38.370,01:22:41.414,"-Because you're a chick. -Oh, Jesus, Robbie."
01:22:43.375,01:22:44.501,"Oh, forget it."
01:22:53.301,01:22:55.971,Why? Because I think guys and chicks are different?
01:22:56.513,01:22:58.807,"Come on, that's all I'm saying. And they are."
01:22:59.766,01:23:04.312,"They each have access to different kinds of pain, which is pretty much why chicks can never be poets."
01:23:04.396,01:23:05.438,-Jesus! -What?
01:23:06.147,01:23:07.774,"Robbie, please, you're not serious."
01:23:07.857,01:23:10.068,That's the most preposterous thing I've ever heard.
01:23:10.151,01:23:12.278,"-Emily Dickinson. -No, that's not the same."
01:23:13.029,01:23:14.155,As what?
01:23:14.239,01:23:16.366,"Whitman, Rimbaud, Shakespeare."
01:23:16.449,01:23:19.703,Grace is… she's really big into Women's Lib.
01:23:19.786,01:23:22.497,"Guys and chicks are different, I'm sorry."
01:23:22.580,01:23:25.375,I cannot believe you're actually saying these things.
01:23:25.458,01:23:32.590,"I cannot believe you actually think that women are incapable of-- Okay, okay, okay. Let's try something, huh?"
01:23:35.093,01:23:42.559,"You write down the nastiest thing you can think of, and I'll write down the nastiest thing I can think of, and… -What? -We'll compare."
01:23:42.642,01:23:45.353,-But what does that prove? -Just do it.
01:23:45.437,01:23:48.148,"-No. No! -Claire, sit down."
01:23:48.231,01:23:49.441,"-No, no, no! I want to know… -Come on, honey."
01:23:49.524,01:23:50.358,Play the game!
01:23:50.442,01:24:04.080,I want to know what this thing is that women cannot experience or… Or write about or talk about What is this place? Do you own this place?
01:24:04.164,01:24:07.500,"-Did you invent it? -Uh, no, honey, I don't."
01:24:07.584,01:24:09.044,"Claire, come on, you're missing the point completely."
01:24:09.127,01:24:10.462,I-I worship women.
01:24:15.050,01:24:16.468,"Claire, come on. I was kidding."
01:24:17.719,01:24:18.970,"Hey, God's a woman."
01:24:23.266,01:24:25.018,"Hey! Fuck you, man!"
01:24:26.269,01:24:28.855,"What are you, fucking deaf? I told you to stop fucking doing that."
01:24:30.440,01:24:31.399,Fuck.
01:24:35.737,01:24:36.654,What?
01:24:39.282,01:24:40.200,What?
01:24:40.283,01:24:41.284,Nothing.
01:24:44.245,01:24:45.330,You've changed.
01:24:46.164,01:24:47.248,"Yeah. Fuck right, I've changed."
01:24:47.332,01:24:50.627,"All of this… these new clothes, new car, these shades."
01:24:50.710,01:24:52.295,You'd never wear shit like that before.
01:24:52.378,01:24:58.968,"Man, you tell me I've changed as if that's all there is to say, you know, in this completely different voice than the one you had ten minutes ago."
01:24:59.803,01:25:03.848,"You know, kids shooting craps in an L.A. Garage pot, and you say nothing's perfect."
01:25:04.641,01:25:07.185,I say it again. There are no politics.
01:25:09.020,01:25:10.063,Right.
01:25:13.983,01:25:14.859,Huh?
01:25:16.861,01:25:17.904,Sign language.
01:25:45.723,01:25:48.643,So who a fellow really was never really mattered.
01:25:51.229,01:25:53.356,Not with what pretending had to offer.
01:25:54.649,01:25:56.776,It was my kind of town.
01:25:58.862,01:26:02.240,"I come in like a Ferris wheel, and, boys, I sure was slick."
01:26:02.824,01:26:05.201,What the heck are you supposed to be?
01:26:05.827,01:26:08.204,"Well, if you don't know, I'm not gonna tell you."
01:26:46.242,01:26:47.160,Chester?
01:26:49.954,01:26:51.789,-Billy. -Mr. McCarty.
01:26:51.873,01:26:52.707,Ma'am.
01:26:54.667,01:26:58.671,So what's with all this doomsday hocus-pocus going on?
01:27:06.888,01:27:08.723,You two taking a trip?
01:27:14.437,01:27:17.732,Seven simple rules for life in hiding.
01:27:20.652,01:27:24.989,One… never trust a cop in a raincoat.
01:27:26.199,01:27:30.245,Two… beware of enthusiasm and of love.
01:27:31.454,01:27:33.915,Each is temporary and quick to sway.
01:27:35.875,01:27:44.217,"Three… when asked if you care about the world's problems, look deep into the eyes of he who asks."
01:27:45.677,01:27:47.178,He will not ask you again.
01:27:48.638,01:27:50.306,"Pack up the meat, sweet."
01:27:50.390,01:27:52.600,It's king for king and queen for queen.
01:27:53.643,01:27:55.019,"Afternoon, Mr. McCarty."
01:27:58.064,01:27:59.732,"-Good afternoon, Billy. -Howdy, Mr. B."
01:28:01.943,01:28:03.903,"Afternoon, Mr. Gladstone, sir."
01:28:03.987,01:28:05.488,"Hey. Hey, hey."
01:28:05.571,01:28:07.031,What are you doing? What are you doing?
01:28:07.115,01:28:08.324,Hey!
01:28:09.909,01:28:11.619,"Hey, you all right, son?"
01:28:11.703,01:28:13.705,"Please, dear man, you gotta get me outta here."
01:28:13.788,01:28:14.789,This here's chicken town.

01:40:33.902,01:40:35.821,Who are you?
01:40:37.281,01:40:42.119,I mean… who gave you permission to even be here?
01:40:45.914,01:40:49.168,"You're… You're like a shadow, man."
01:40:50.335,01:40:56.049,"Maybe you were hip once, but that trick got old, man, a long time ago."
01:40:57.009,01:41:01.346,"Now, every time you open your mouth, it's like, how long is this gonna take?"
01:41:03.223,01:41:05.642,It's not like anyone's gonna tell you to your face.

01:41:24.536,01:41:27.456,"Oh, man, it's sad."
01:41:30.167,01:41:31.877,You used to be funny.
01:41:32.628,01:41:37.216,And you honestly think that chick sees you as anything but a… as a tool?
01:41:43.555,01:41:45.682,"Oh, no, you're kidding me."
01:41:45.766,01:41:47.476,I can't even watch this.

01:43:39.463,01:43:41.256,Why don't you do your early stuff?
01:43:52.935,01:44:05.280,"and kingdoms totter, when disaster follows hard upon disaster and terror hangs on every side… Why hast Thou made me Thy mark?"
01:44:15.582,01:44:18.377,It's hard not to go to hell.
01:44:19.002,01:44:22.589,"There's so many distractions, so many influences."

01:44:33.809,01:44:36.436,Gabriel blows his horn.
01:44:37.479,01:44:45.904,"He was having a lot of worries, telling me things and… I just asked him one day, I said, Have you ever prayed?"
01:44:46.613,01:44:49.825,"And he said, Pray?"
01:44:51.118,01:44:52.661,"You know, like that."
01:44:53.704,01:44:55.831,And he started asking a lot of questions.
01:44:58.959,01:45:00.669,I sure knew who he was.
01:45:02.295,01:45:03.797,People worshipped him.
01:45:04.339,01:45:10.637,Maybe only Jesus could've unburdened someone like that from such omnipotence.

01:45:46.173,01:45:47.632,I asked him why.
01:45:47.716,01:45:51.094,Old things are passed away.
01:45:52.095,01:45:53.972,All things are made anew.
01:45:55.223,01:45:56.808,It doesn't matter what I did before.
01:46:00.812,01:46:05.317,"Never told you who to vote for or to follow anybody, back then when I was selling my records."
01:46:06.818,01:46:09.988,What I didn't know is that it didn't matter what kind of music you were playing.
01:46:11.281,01:46:18.830,"Folk, pop, rock 'n roll… we're all rolled up in the devil's pocket."
01:46:18.914,01:46:24.169,"Now, I'm not talking about a devil with the pitchfork and horns."
01:46:24.878,01:46:29.716,I'm talking about a spiritual devil in the midnight hour.
01:46:30.759,01:46:32.636,He's gotta be overcome.
01:46:34.179,01:46:39.559,"And we here in America, we shall overcome."
01:46:40.102,01:46:45.357,What greater honor for a nation than to speak for God?
01:46:46.233,01:46:54.241,For some say that the war to end all wars has already begun …where it is prophesized that the weak will fall.
01:46:56.827,01:46:59.830,And that Jesus will set up His kingdom in Jerusalem.
01:46:59.913,01:47:05.252,"So why should we worry when we're already free, right here, right now?"
01:47:05.335,01:47:06.795,And why are you free?
01:47:06.878,01:47:08.672,You're free because Jesus paid for you to be.
01:47:08.755,01:47:09.756,That's why you're free.
01:47:10.799,01:47:13.802,You're free to seek the higher calling of the Lord.
01:47:16.304,01:47:18.932,Now pick up your bed and walk.
01:49:20.345,01:49:21.179,Fuck!
01:50:00.719,01:50:10.520,and I continually fail to communicate because I continue to blame myself even when I'm not to blame.
01:50:11.896,01:50:29.080,"Because each failing has made me more remote from myself, from my babies, and from you… For all these reasons and many more still unknown… I must listen."
01:50:30.707,01:50:33.126,I must look around more than ever.
01:50:35.462,01:50:36.463,I must leave.
01:51:02.989,01:51:03.907,All right.
01:51:08.953,01:51:09.996,Thank you.
01:51:15.919,01:51:17.003,Not with the girls.

01:51:23.760,01:51:25.053,What are you going to do?
01:51:25.553,01:51:26.638,What would you do?
01:51:27.889,01:51:29.349,"Because I would, you know?"
01:51:29.933,01:51:31.184,Perhaps I even would.
01:51:31.267,01:51:33.228,"If you actually could, who knows?"
01:51:37.190,01:51:43.613,"But I'm not going to take your children away from you, Robbie, so you don't have to… to try and threaten me."
01:54:45.336,01:54:49.257,"But they took away the meaning, Alice, and I was a pawn in their game."
01:54:50.049,01:54:59.392,"I'm telling you, if I don't bust out of here quick, try and dope things out… so long, Alice."
01:55:00.685,01:55:02.937,"Jack, where are you gonna go?"
01:55:04.939,01:55:06.441,First place that doesn't know my name.
01:55:14.699,01:55:24.834,"So, good people of Riddle, we come here with no intent to disrupt, but only to commend you for your patient courage in this time of change."
01:55:25.960,01:55:34.093,"And in addition, we are pleased to announce the evacuation fund has been established by the state of Missouri as I pledged to you it would be."
01:55:37.680,01:55:41.017,Exactly what does that do for the common folk like myself?
01:55:41.100,01:55:48.983,"Dollar compensation will be made available to, uh, uh… Eligible evacuees."
01:55:49.067,01:55:51.694,So what you want to do is throw some pennies after you done took our lives!
01:55:52.779,01:55:57.450,"I assure you, boy, nobody here in the business of taking lives."
01:55:57.533,01:56:01.162,Might wanna explain that to Ms. Henry up there.
01:56:01.663,01:56:06.000,"Yeah, or Ms. Montgomery. Or how about Old Man Sykes?"
01:56:06.834,01:56:12.173,"Yeah, well, the way I see it, you can either go through Riddle, or you can go around them, so why are you going through our town?"
01:56:15.760,01:56:16.761,You there.
01:56:18.554,01:56:20.139,-What's your name? -My name?
01:56:20.223,01:56:22.934,-Mm. -William.
01:56:23.017,01:56:25.103,"William, did you say? Show your face."
01:56:27.105,01:56:28.147,"Yes, sir."
01:56:30.566,01:56:40.702,"I had… I had a friend… However, thing is, sir, truly, you got us hanging by a thread here."
01:56:40.785,01:56:43.121,Who are you? I know you.
01:56:44.580,01:56:46.249,I don't reckon so.
01:56:46.332,01:56:47.875,You ever live in Dallas County?
01:56:48.710,01:56:51.004,-Can't say I have. -New Mexico?
01:56:51.087,01:56:52.005,No!
01:56:52.088,01:56:54.716,"You were talented. Boy, you could shoot."
01:56:56.342,01:56:59.012,You could sing a ditty like nobody I ever seen.
01:56:59.095,01:57:00.972,You got… You got any musical strain?
01:57:02.932,01:57:04.308,I never had the knack.
01:57:05.309,01:57:12.567,"What we're saying is that you and your boys, you go do as you please, just so long as you stay clear of Riddle County."
01:57:15.737,01:57:17.739,"Do you think you're speaking for the people, sir?"
01:57:17.822,01:57:20.324,You are just stirring up lies and getting folks agitated.
01:57:21.075,01:57:23.619,"Now, we have methods for dealing with scoundrels like yourself."
01:57:34.047,01:57:35.131,"Boys, bring him in!"
01:57:35.631,01:57:37.717,"Hey, hey, what do you think you're doing?"
01:57:40.219,01:57:41.512,Quiet down!
01:57:41.596,01:57:48.186,No need to get off to cause another insurgence… Take care of my horse! Take care of my horse!
01:58:29.060,01:58:30.394,festering somewhere.
01:58:31.187,01:58:34.690,"I don't mean like Woody Guthrie, wasting away in some hospital."
01:58:35.483,01:58:36.651,His vitals are stable.
01:58:37.568,01:58:38.653,What he needs is sleep.
01:58:42.532,01:58:45.243,"That's nature's will, and I'm against nature."
01:58:47.829,01:58:49.455,I don't dig nature at all.
01:58:50.748,01:58:52.834,I don't think he can get back on stage.
01:58:53.960,01:58:59.924,"He's gotten inside so many psyches, and death is just such a part of the American scene right now."
01:59:00.925,01:59:02.802,It's the reds that make him mean.
01:59:03.427,01:59:04.720,He's already gone.
01:59:10.643,01:59:12.812,…which nature cannot touch with decay.
02:00:45.029,02:00:46.197,"Don't worry, Mr. B."
02:00:46.280,02:00:47.865,Your secret's safe with me.
02:00:49.075,02:00:50.743,God save the secrets.
02:00:54.664,02:00:55.623,"And you too, Homer."
02:00:55.706,02:00:56.666,Come on.
02:01:36.998,02:01:37.957,Henry!
02:01:38.708,02:01:39.917,Henry!
02:01:40.710,02:01:43.087,"Come on, Henry. Come on, girl. Come on."
02:01:43.671,02:01:44.672,Come on!
02:01:44.755,02:01:45.798,Henry!
02:01:46.549,02:01:47.508,Come on!
02:01:50.011,02:01:51.637,"Bye, Henry!"
02:01:58.060,02:01:59.854,"Goodbye, my lady."
02:03:01.791,02:03:06.003,what kind of nasty names people invent for the music.
02:03:06.587,02:03:12.968,"But, uh, folk music is just a word, you know, that I can't use anymore."
02:03:14.220,02:03:22.103,"What I'm talking about is traditional music, right, which is to say it's mathematical music, it's based on hexagons."
02:03:22.812,02:03:35.074,"But all these songs about, you know, roses growing out of people's brains and lovers who are really geese and swans are turning into angels… I mean, you know, they're not going to die."
02:03:35.157,02:03:36.909,They're not folk music songs.
02:03:36.992,02:03:38.869,They're political songs.
02:03:39.870,02:03:41.080,They're already dead.
02:03:42.915,02:03:53.926,"You'd think that these traditional music people would… would gather that mystery, you know, is a traditional fact, you know, seeing as they're all so full of mystery."
02:03:54.844,02:03:55.970,And contradictions.
02:03:56.887,02:03:58.347,"Yeah, contradictions."
02:03:59.723,02:04:00.724,And chaos.
02:04:01.434,02:04:05.855,"Yes, it's chaos, clocks, and watermelons… You know, it's… it's everything."
02:04:11.610,02:04:18.075,"These people actually think I have some kind of, uh… fantastic imagination."
02:04:20.327,02:04:21.912,"It gets very, uh, lonesome."
02:04:24.665,02:04:29.879,"But traditional music is just, uh… It's too unreal to die."
02:04:29.962,02:04:31.338,It doesn't need to be protected.
02:04:32.756,02:04:37.678,"You know, I mean, in that music is the only true valid death you can feel today, you know, off a record player."
02:04:39.972,02:04:42.808,"But like everything else in great demand, people try to own it."
02:04:47.897,02:04:51.233,"Has to do with, like, uh, the purity thing."
02:04:53.319,02:04:55.696,I think its meaninglessness is holy.
02:04:58.908,02:05:01.285,Everybody knows I'm not a folk singer.
02:05:54.964,02:05:59.009,Freedom to live a certain way without being kicked around.
02:06:06.141,02:06:10.646,"Course, the more you live a certain way, the less it feels like freedom."
02:06:18.028,02:06:21.824,Me? I can change during the course of a day.
02:06:21.907,02:06:26.870,"I wake and I'm one person, and when I go to sleep, I know for certain I'm somebody else."
02:06:28.455,02:06:30.624,"I don't know who I am, most of the time."
02:06:45.222,02:06:50.311,"It's like you got yesterday, today, and tomorrow, all in the same room."
02:06:56.025,02:06:58.068,There's no tellin' what can happen.
