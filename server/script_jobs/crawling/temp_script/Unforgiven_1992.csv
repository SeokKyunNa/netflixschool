00:04:52.667,00:05:00.291,"MAYBE SHE CAN CLEAN UP THE PLACE OR SOMETHING, BUT NOBODY'S GOING TO PAY GOOD MONEY FOR A CUT-UP WHORE."
00:05:00.333,00:05:05.166,"YOU BOYS OFF THE BAR T, YOU GOT YOUR OWN STRING OF PONIES?"
00:05:05.208,00:05:07.083,Y-YEAH.

00:05:33.959,00:05:36.041,"HERE'S THE BULLWHIP, BILL."
00:05:38.208,00:05:40.917,MAYBE WE DON'T NEED THIS WHIP NOW.
00:05:42.375,00:05:49.542,"LET ME TELL YOU-- COME THE SPRING, SKINNY DON'T HAVE THOSE PONIES, I'M GOING TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU."
00:05:49.583,00:05:51.458,YOU AIN'T EVEN GOING TO WHIP THEM?
00:05:53.000,00:05:55.667,"WELL, I FINED THEM INSTEAD, ALICE."
00:05:55.709,00:06:00.125,"FOR WHAT THEY DONE, SKINNY GETS SOME PONIES, AND THAT'S IT?"
00:06:00.166,00:06:01.959,"THAT AIN'T FAIR, LITTLE BILL."
00:06:02.000,00:06:03.458,THAT AIN'T FAIR!

00:06:15.959,00:06:18.583,"UH, HELL, ALICE..."
00:06:18.625,00:06:21.583,"IT AIN'T LIKE THEY WAS, UH..."

00:07:05.625,00:07:09.875,"IF DELILAH DOESN'T CARE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER, WHAT ARE WE ALL GETTING SO RILED UP ABOUT?"
00:07:09.917,00:07:17.166,JUST BECAUSE WE LET THEM SMELLY FOOLS RIDE US LIKE HORSES DON'T MEAN WE GOT TO LET THEM BRAND US LIKE HORSES.
00:07:17.208,00:07:22.875,"MAYBE WE AIN'T NOTHING BUT WHORES, BUT WE--BY GOD, WE AIN'T HORSES."
00:07:22.917,00:07:25.959,I GOT $112.

00:36:40.166,00:36:44.917,"IF I'M GOING TO GET SHOT, I'D RATHER IT WAS HOT THAN COLD."
00:36:44.959,00:36:47.125,EVERYTHING HURTS ME MORE WHEN IT'S COLD.
00:36:47.166,00:36:51.333,"YOU KNOW HOW IF YOU HIT YOUR THUMB AND IT'S COLD-- SHUT UP, FATTY."

00:37:12.333,00:37:14.375,BUILDING HIS PORCH?
00:37:14.417,00:37:18.625,"IF YOU WERE TO GET SHOT, ANDY, WOULD YOU LIKE IT BETTER ON A HOT DAY OR A COLD DAY?"
00:37:18.667,00:37:20.667,I AIN'T GONNA GET SHOT.
00:37:21.959,00:37:23.458,"HE'S COMING, AIN'T HE?"
00:37:23.500,00:37:25.875,OF COURSE HE'S COMING.
00:37:25.917,00:37:28.125,I JUST LOADED THAT.
00:37:28.166,00:37:30.625,I DON'T TRUST NOBODY TO LOAD MY GUNS.
00:37:30.667,00:37:32.875,NOT FOR A SHOOTING.
00:37:32.917,00:37:34.166,WHAT DID HE SAY?
00:37:34.208,00:37:36.208,LITTLE BILL?
00:37:36.250,00:37:38.625,HE SAID HE WAS BUILDING HIS PORCH.

00:37:40.250,00:37:42.625,IT WAS ALL LOADED.
00:37:40.250,00:37:45.917,"I MEAN, JESUS, CLYDE, YOU GOT 3 PISTOLS AND ONLY GOT ONE ARM, FOR CHRIST SAKE."
00:37:45.959,00:37:48.625,I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET KILLED FOR LACK OF SHOOTING BACK.
00:37:50.458,00:37:54.500,"YOU KNOW, HE DON'T HAVE A STRAIGHT ANGLE ON THAT WHOLE GODDAMN PORCH."
00:37:54.542,00:37:56.667,"OR THE WHOLE HOUSE, FOR THAT MATTER."
00:37:56.709,00:37:59.500,HE IS THE WORST DAMN CARPENTER.
00:37:59.542,00:38:01.834,"HE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING, HUH?"
00:38:01.875,00:38:04.875,"ASKED WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE, THAT'S ALL."
00:38:04.917,00:38:09.000,"CHRIST, MAYBE HE'S TOUGH, BUT HE SURE AIN'T NO CARPENTER."
00:38:09.041,00:38:11.333,MAYBE HE AIN'T SO TOUGH.
00:38:11.375,00:38:14.041,SEEM LIKE HE WAS SCARED?

00:38:25.208,00:38:28.208,"LITTLE BILL COME OUT OF KANSAS AND TEXAS, BOYS."
00:38:28.250,00:38:31.083,HE WORKED IN TOUGH TOWNS.
00:38:31.125,00:38:32.709,JUST WONDERED.
00:38:34.333,00:38:36.625,ANYBODY COULD BE SCARED.
00:38:41.083,00:38:43.333,"WELL, HE WASN'T SCARED, BOYS."
00:38:44.709,00:38:46.709,HE JUST AIN'T NO CARPENTER.
00:38:52.542,00:38:58.083,"WELL, THERE'S A DIGNITY IN ROYALTY, A MAJESTY, WHICH PRECLUDES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ASSASSINATION."
00:38:58.125,00:39:04.542,"NOW, IF YOU WERE TO POINT A PISTOL AT A KING OR QUEEN, YOUR HANDS WOULD SHAKE AS THOUGH PALSIED."
00:39:04.583,00:39:07.041,"I WOULDN'T POINT NO PISTOL AT NOBODY, SIR."
00:39:07.083,00:39:10.083,"OH, THAT'S A WISE POLICY, A WISE POLICY."
00:39:10.125,00:39:22.500,"BUT IF YOU DID, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IF YOU DID, THAT THE SIGHT OF ROYALTY WILL CAUSE YOU TO DISMISS ALL THOUGHTS OF BLOODSHED AND YOU WOULD STAND-- HOW SHALL I PUT IT-- IN AWE."
00:39:22.542,00:39:24.625,NOW...
00:39:24.667,00:39:27.625,A PRESIDENT?
00:39:24.667,00:39:30.166,"WELL, I MEAN, WHY NOT SHOOT THE PRESIDENT?"
00:39:30.208,00:39:32.500,HA HA HA HA.

00:49:21.041,00:49:22.333,WE WAS FOLLOWING YOU.
00:49:22.375,00:49:26.500,"LIKE YOU SAID, IF I CHANGED MY MIND-- WASN'T NOTHING SAID ABOUT NO PARTNER, WILL."
00:49:26.542,00:49:29.000,"Will: WELL, THIS HERE'S NED LOGAN."
00:49:29.041,00:49:32.375,"THIS IS THE SCHOFIELD KID, NEPHEW TO PETE SOTHOW."
00:49:32.417,00:49:34.542,I SEEN 2 FELLAS FOLLOWING ME.
00:49:34.583,00:49:36.625,MY GUESS IS YOU COME TO KILL ME.
00:49:36.667,00:49:39.667,WE NEVER TALKED ABOUT NO OTHER FELLA.
00:49:39.709,00:49:42.208,"WELL, THERE'S 2 OF THEM COWBOYS, ISN'T THERE?"
00:49:42.250,00:49:45.333,"BETTER THERE'S 3 OF US, IN CASE THEY GOT FRIENDS."
00:49:45.375,00:49:47.667,I FIGURE I CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM COWBOYS MYSELF.
00:49:47.709,00:49:49.375,IT DON'T TAKE 3.
00:49:49.417,00:49:51.667,NED'S AN AWFUL GOOD SHOT WITH A RIFLE.
00:49:51.709,00:49:54.208,HIT A BIRD IN THE EYE FLYING.
00:49:54.250,00:49:56.542,"BETTER THAN YOU, ANYHOW, KID."
00:49:56.583,00:49:58.917,"HELL, YOU WASN'T EVEN COMING CLOSE."
00:49:58.959,00:50:01.417,"GET YOUR DAMN HANDS OFF MY RIFLE, MISTER."
00:50:10.417,00:50:13.417,THOUGHT I'D CHECK IT FOR YOU.
00:50:13.458,00:50:14.667,THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING WAS BENT.
00:50:14.709,00:50:16.250,IT AIN'T BENT.
00:50:16.291,00:50:19.375,"WELL, YOU WAS SHOOTING ALL OVER CREATION."
00:50:19.417,00:50:21.125,YOU GOING TO SHARE YOUR HALF WITH HIM?
00:50:21.166,00:50:23.542,I FIGURE 3 WAYS.
00:50:23.583,00:50:26.125,YOU FIGURED WRONG.
00:50:27.291,00:50:29.959,"SORRY I WASTED YOUR TIME, NED."
00:50:32.125,00:50:34.417,"WHAT, YOU GOING BACK WITH HIM?"
00:50:35.417,00:50:36.917,"WELL, HE'S MY PARTNER."
00:50:36.959,00:50:39.458,"HE DON'T GO, I DON'T GO."
00:50:43.625,00:50:46.375,WHAT'S IT COME TO 3 WAYS?
00:51:40.208,00:51:41.709,SHIT.

00:51:49.583,00:51:51.041,LOOKING AT?
00:51:51.083,00:51:52.542,"CLOUDS, KID."
00:51:52.583,00:51:56.792,HE WAS LOOKING AT THEM CLOUDS OVER YONDER ON ACCOUNT OF WE GOT A STORM RIDING UP OUR ASS.
00:51:58.625,00:51:59.750,"OH, THEM."
00:51:59.792,00:52:01.500,"HELL, I SEEN THEM."
00:52:11.083,00:52:15.041,"YOU WERE SMART TO CHANGE YOUR MIND, KID."

00:52:27.333,00:52:29.250,I COULD HIT THAT HAWK WITH ONE SHOT.
00:52:31.792,00:52:37.333,"HELL, I COULD HIT IT, TOO, NED, IF I DIDN'T MIND WASTING A SHOT."
00:52:39.166,00:52:42.125,"THERE AIN'T NO HAWK, KID."
00:52:42.166,00:52:44.667,"YOU CAN'T SEE FOR SHIT, CAN YOU?"

00:52:59.333,00:53:01.083,"WE AIN'T GOING TO WYOMING TO SHOOT CANTEENS, GODDAMN IT."
00:53:01.125,00:53:02.583,HOW FAR? 100 YARDS?

00:53:05.625,00:53:07.125,"FUCK YOU, NED."
00:53:07.166,00:53:08.709,"HE'S BLIND, WILL."
00:53:08.750,00:53:10.166,"I AIN'T BLIND, YOU ASSHOLE!"
00:53:10.208,00:53:12.000,"NOW, HOLD ON. HOLD IT."
00:53:12.041,00:53:15.417,"HOW FAR CAN YOU SEE, KID?"
00:53:15.458,00:53:18.417,"YOU BET YOUR ASS I CAN SEE 50 YARDS, WILL."

00:53:22.625,00:53:24.083,"NOW, HOLD ON."
00:53:24.125,00:53:25.917,"YOU HEAR THAT, NED?"
00:53:25.959,00:53:28.709,KID CAN SEE 50 YARDS FINE.
00:53:29.709,00:53:31.041,JESUS.
00:53:34.041,00:53:36.000,50 YARDS WILL DO JUST FINE.
00:53:36.041,00:53:37.542,NOW LET'S MOVE OUT.
00:53:46.625,00:53:50.709,"BOY, THEY LOOK LIKE REAL HARD CASES, BOB."
00:53:50.750,00:53:55.333,"DID YOU KILL ALL 7 OF THEM DEAD, OR JUST WING SOME OF THEM?"
00:54:00.625,00:54:04.667,"NOW, THAT IS YOU THERE, HERE EMBALMED ON THE COVER?"
00:54:06.208,00:54:08.458,THE DUCK OF DEATH?
00:54:08.500,00:54:10.542,"UH, THE DUKE."
00:54:10.583,00:54:13.625,D-D-DUKE OF DEATH.
00:54:13.667,00:54:15.625,"DUKE. OH, YEAH."
00:54:15.667,00:54:19.333,"YOU ALWAYS WERE HELL AND JESUS WITH A PISTOL, BOB."
00:54:19.375,00:54:20.625,BUT 7 OF THEM? BOY.
00:54:20.667,00:54:22.333,AND YOU PROTECTING THAT WOMAN AND ALL.
00:54:22.375,00:54:24.625,HOW THE HELL DO YOU DO THAT?
00:54:24.667,00:54:26.125,UH...
00:54:26.166,00:54:27.375,"WELL, YOU SEE, UH..."
00:54:27.417,00:54:34.917,IT'S GENERALLY CONSIDERED DESIRABLE IN THE PUBLISHING BUSINESS TO TAKE A CERTAIN LIBERTY WHEN YOU'RE DEPICTING THE COVER SCENE.
00:54:34.959,00:54:37.417,"IT'S FOR REASONS INVOLVING THE MARKETPLACE, ET CETERA."
00:54:37.458,00:54:44.250,"WELL, MR. BEAUCHAMP, FROM WHAT I READ IN THIS HERE BOOK, THE WRITING'S NOT THAT MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE PICTURE."
00:54:44.291,00:54:50.667,"WELL, I CAN ASSURE YOU, MR. DAGGETT, THAT THE EVENTS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THERE ARE TAKEN FROM THE ACCOUNT OF EYEWITNESSES, SIR."
00:54:50.709,00:54:51.667,EYEWITNESSES?
00:54:51.709,00:54:53.000,"YES, SIR."
00:54:53.041,00:54:55.709,"YOU MEAN LIKE THE DUCK HIMSELF, I GUESS."
00:54:57.041,00:54:59.291,THE--THE DUKE.
00:54:59.333,00:55:01.000,"DUCK, I SAYS."
00:55:09.166,00:55:15.333,"YOU HAVE INSULTED THE HONOR OF THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, CORCORAN, SAID THE DUCK."
00:55:15.375,00:55:18.166,YOU MUST APOLOGIZE.
00:55:18.208,00:55:30.208,"BUT TWO-GUN CORCORAN WOULD HAVE NONE OF IT, AND CURSING, HE REACHED FOR HIS PISTOLS AND WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM, BUT THE DUCK WAS FASTER, AND HOT LEAD BLAZED FROM HIS SMOKING SIX-GUNS."
00:55:30.250,00:55:39.083,"SEE, I CONSIDER THAT TO BE AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF THE EVENTS, ALBEIT--ALL RIGHT-- THERE IS A CERTAIN POETRY TO THE LANGUAGE, WHICH I COULDN'T RESIST."
00:55:39.125,00:55:40.417,"UH, MR. BEAUCHAMP..."
00:55:41.709,00:55:51.417,"I WAS IN THE BLUE BOTTLE SALOON IN WICHITA THE NIGHT THAT ENGLISH BOB KILLED CORKY CORCORAN, AND I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE..."
00:55:51.458,00:55:52.917,NOR NO WOMAN...
00:55:52.959,00:55:55.709,NO TWO-GUN SHOOTERS...
00:55:55.750,00:55:57.291,NOR NONE OF THIS.
00:55:57.333,00:55:58.542,YOU WERE THERE?
00:55:58.583,00:56:00.208,"YEAH, I WAS THERE."
00:56:02.542,00:56:04.375,FIRST OFF...
00:56:04.417,00:56:08.625,"CORKY NEVER CARRIED TWO GUNS, ALTHOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE."
00:56:08.667,00:56:11.291,"NOW, HE--HE WAS-- HE WAS CALLED TWO-GUN CORCORAN."
00:56:11.333,00:56:15.625,"A LOT OF FOLKS DID CALL HIM TWO-GUN, BUT THAT WASN'T BECAUSE HE WAS SPORTING TWO PISTOLS."
00:56:15.667,00:56:21.625,"THAT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD A DICK THAT WAS SO BIG, IT WAS LONGER THAN THE BARREL ON THAT WALKER COLT HE CARRIED."
00:56:21.667,00:56:28.959,AND THE ONLY INSULTING HE EVER DID WAS STICK THAT THING OF HIS INTO THIS FRENCH LADY THAT ENGLISH BOB HERE WAS KIND OF SWEET ON.
00:56:29.000,00:56:38.542,"SEE, THE NIGHT THAT CORKY WALKED INTO THE BLUE BOTTLE, AND BEFORE HE KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, BOB HERE TAKES A SHOT AT HIM, AND HE MISSES BECAUSE HE'S DAMN DRUNK."
00:56:38.583,00:56:42.709,"NOW, THAT BULLET WHIZZING BY PANICKED OLD CORKY, AND HE DID THE WRONG THING."
00:56:42.750,00:56:46.166,"HE WENT FOR HIS GUN IN SUCH A HURRY, HE SHOT HIS OWN DAMN TOE OFF."
00:56:46.208,00:56:52.166,"MEANTIME, BOB HERE, HE'S AIMING REAL GOOD, AND HE SQUEEZES OFF ANOTHER."
00:56:52.208,00:56:58.083,"BUT HE MISSES 'CAUSE HE'S STILL SO DAMN DRUNK, AND HE HITS THIS $1,000 MIRROR UP OVER THE BAR."
00:56:58.125,00:57:03.667,BUT NOW THE DUCK OF DEATH IS AS GOOD AS DEAD BECAUSE CORKY DOES IT RIGHT.
00:57:03.709,00:57:06.041,HE AIMS REAL CAREFUL.
00:57:06.083,00:57:07.125,NO HURRY.
00:57:07.166,00:57:08.208,AND?
00:57:08.250,00:57:10.166,BAM!
00:57:10.208,00:57:15.667,"THE WALKER COLT BLEW UP IN HIS HAND, WHICH WAS A FAILING COMMON TO THAT MODEL."
00:57:15.709,00:57:25.041,"YOU SEE, THOUGH, IF CORKY HAD HAD TWO GUNS INSTEAD OF JUST A BIG DICK, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE RIGHT TO THE END TO DEFEND HIMSELF."
00:57:25.083,00:57:26.709,WAIT A MINUTE.
00:57:26.750,00:57:35.125,Y-YOU MEAN THAT ENGLISH BOB KILLED HIM WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE-- OLD BOB WASN'T GOING TO WAIT FOR CORKY TO GROW A NEW HAND.
00:57:35.166,00:57:39.041,"NO, HE JUST WALKED OVER THERE REAL SLOW..."
00:57:39.083,00:57:41.417,'CAUSE HE WAS DRUNK.
00:57:42.750,00:57:45.750,SHOT HIM RIGHT THROUGH THE LIVER. POP!
00:58:05.959,00:58:09.583,"DAMN, I DON'T LIKE ROCKS ALL OVER MY DADGUM BACK."
00:58:09.625,00:58:11.667,I SURE DO MISS MY BED.
00:58:11.709,00:58:13.375,YOU SAID THAT LAST NIGHT.
00:58:13.417,00:58:15.917,"NO, LAST NIGHT I SAID I MISSED MY WIFE."
00:58:15.959,00:58:17.667,TONIGHT I JUST MISS MY DADGUM BED.
00:58:19.625,00:58:22.667,"YOU'LL MISS YOUR DADGUM ROOF HERE IN A WHILE, I SUPPOSE."
00:58:22.709,00:58:25.500,"OH, SHIT."
00:58:36.500,00:58:37.959,"SAY, WILL."
00:58:38.000,00:58:40.583,HMM?
00:58:40.625,00:58:45.041,"THAT BUSINESS UP IN JACKSON COUNTY, THAT REALLY HAPPEN?"
00:58:45.083,00:58:46.959,I MEAN THE WAY THEY SAY IT HAPPENED.
00:58:47.000,00:58:49.750,WHAT BUSINESS?
00:58:51.166,00:58:55.458,ON HOW THERE'S 2 DEPUTIES UP CLOSE POINTING THEIR RIFLES RIGHT AT YOU.
00:58:55.500,00:58:57.417,HAD YOU DEAD TO RIGHTS.
00:58:57.458,00:59:00.625,YOU PULLED OUT YOUR PISTOL AND BLEW THEM BOTH TO HELL.
00:59:00.667,00:59:03.208,ONLY TOOK A SCRATCH YOURSELF.
00:59:07.667,00:59:09.500,YEAH.
00:59:09.542,00:59:15.291,"UNCLE PETE SAYS HE NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT, SHOOTING YOUR WAY OUT OF A SCRAPE LIKE THAT."
00:59:17.291,00:59:19.083,YEAH.
00:59:19.125,00:59:21.667,"WELL, I DON'T RECOLLECT."
00:59:24.709,00:59:26.667,YOU DON'T RECOLLECT?
00:59:26.709,00:59:28.709,THAT'S RIGHT.
00:59:30.500,00:59:31.709,"SAY, NED."
00:59:34.041,00:59:36.709,HOW MANY MEN YOU KILLED?
00:59:40.709,00:59:43.333,AIN'T YOU GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTION?
00:59:43.375,00:59:45.625,WHAT THE HELL'S THAT TO YOU?
00:59:47.709,00:59:53.291,"WELL, I GOT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF FELLA I'M RIDING WITH, IN CASE WE GET INTO A SCRAPE AND ALL."
00:59:56.417,00:59:58.667,"HOW MANY MEN YOU KILLED, KID?"
00:59:58.709,01:00:00.458,5.
01:00:00.500,01:00:01.667,HOW MANY?
01:00:04.166,01:00:06.166,5.
01:00:06.208,01:00:08.125,I DONE KILLED 5 OF THEM.
01:00:09.750,01:00:11.250,THAT'S INCLUDING A MEXICAN.
01:00:11.291,01:00:14.125,HE COME AT ME WITH A KNIFE.
01:00:14.166,01:00:16.250,WOULD YOU SHUT UP AND GET SOME REST.
01:00:16.291,01:00:20.542,"YOU BOYS ARE AS CROTCHETY AS A COUPLE OF OLD HENS, LET ME TELL YOU."
01:00:22.166,01:00:29.166,"ACTUALLY, THEN, MR. CORCORAN WAS FASTER ON THE DRAW THAN THE DUCK-- THAN..."
01:00:29.208,01:00:30.250,E-ENGLISH BOB.
01:00:30.291,01:00:33.166,FASTER? FASTER WAS HIS MISTAKE.
01:00:33.208,01:00:38.083,"IF HE HADN'T BEEN IN SUCH A GODDAMN HURRY, HE WOULDN'T HAVE SHOT HIMSELF IN THE TOE WITH THAT FIRST SHOT."
01:00:38.125,01:00:39.667,HE WOULD HAVE KILLED OLD BOB.
01:00:39.709,01:00:40.792,"LOOK, SON..."
01:00:42.208,01:00:50.709,"BEING A GOOD SHOT AND BEING QUICK WITH A PISTOL-- THAT DON'T DO NO HARM, BUT IT DON'T MEAN MUCH NEXT TO BEING COOL-HEADED."
01:00:50.750,01:00:56.709,"A MAN WHO'LL KEEP HIS HEAD AND NOT GET RATTLED UNDER FIRE, LIKE AS NOT, HE'LL KILL YOU."
01:00:56.750,01:01:02.083,"BUT IF THE OTHER FELLA IS QUICKER AND FIRES FIRST-- THEN HE'LL BE HURRYING, THEN HE'LL MISS."
01:01:02.125,01:01:03.166,LOOK HERE.
01:01:06.166,01:01:13.750,"THAT'S ABOUT AS FAST AS I CAN DRAW AND AIM AND HIT ANYTHING MORE THAN 10 FEET AWAY, UNLESS IT'S A BARN."
01:01:13.792,01:01:16.792,BUT IF HE DOESN'T MISS?
01:01:16.834,01:01:19.000,THEN HE'LL KILL YOU.
01:01:23.000,01:01:27.083,THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO FEW DANGEROUS MEN AROUND LIKE OLD BOB AND...
01:01:27.125,01:01:29.000,LIKE ME.
01:01:29.041,01:01:34.750,"IT AIN'T SO EASY TO SHOOT A MAN, ANYHOW, YOU KNOW, ESPECIALLY IF THE SON OF A BITCH IS SHOOTING BACK AT YOU."
01:01:34.792,01:01:38.000,"I MEAN, THAT'LL JUST FLAT RATTLE SOME FOLKS."
01:01:38.041,01:01:39.333,LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
01:01:39.375,01:01:41.333,WAIT. JUST--JUST-- LOOK HERE.
01:01:41.375,01:01:44.583,I KNOW. JUST-- TAKE THAT.
01:01:46.083,01:01:47.375,"GO ON, TAKE IT."
01:01:51.083,01:01:53.291,THERE'S THE KEY.
01:01:54.375,01:01:56.333,ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS SHOOT ME...
01:01:56.375,01:02:01.667,AND YOU AND BOB CAN JUST RIDE OUT OF HERE FREE AS BIRDS.
01:02:06.208,01:02:08.750,WAIT. IT ISN'T-- IS IT LOADED?
01:02:08.792,01:02:10.792,WOULDN'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD IF IT WASN'T.
01:02:10.834,01:02:12.333,FIRST YOU GOT TO COCK IT.
01:02:18.959,01:02:21.208,"GO ON, COCK IT."
01:02:28.834,01:02:31.333,NOW YOU GOT TO POINT IT.
01:02:34.250,01:02:36.333,"GO ON, POINT IT."
01:02:44.583,01:02:48.291,"NOW ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS PULL THE TRIGGER, MISTER."
01:03:03.083,01:03:04.875,"HOT, AIN'T IT?"
01:03:04.917,01:03:06.375,YEAH.
01:03:06.417,01:03:10.166,YOU DIDN'T EVEN PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER.
01:03:10.208,01:03:14.583,WHAT IF--WHAT IF-- WHAT IF I GAVE IT TO HIM?
01:03:15.583,01:03:17.333,GIVE IT TO HIM.
01:03:25.333,01:03:28.333,YOU--YOU DON'T REALLY WANT ME TO-- GIVE IT TO HIM.

01:21:23.041,01:21:24.834,NO MORE ADVANCES ON WHAT YOU AIN'T DONE YET.
01:21:24.875,01:21:28.000,"HEY, SWEETHEART, WE'RE JUST WAITING ON THE WEATHER TO CLEAR."
01:21:28.041,01:21:31.250,ONCE THIS WEATHER CLEARS UP-- WE'RE GOING TO NEED MORE FOOD.

01:21:39.709,01:21:41.208,WE DON'T NEED HIM.

01:21:43.250,01:21:47.208,"BESIDES, HE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A BROKEN-DOWN PIG FARMER."

01:50:19.709,01:50:21.333,HE DIDN'T KILL ANYONE.
01:50:21.375,01:50:23.291,HE WENT SOUTH YESTERDAY.
01:50:23.333,01:50:25.959,WHY WOULD ANYBODY KILL NED?
01:50:27.583,01:50:29.500,WHO KILLED HIM?

01:50:36.709,01:50:41.667,"HE WAS MAKING HIM ANSWER QUESTIONS AND BEATING HIM UP, AND THEN NED JUST DIED."
01:50:41.709,01:50:44.667,THEY GOT A SIGN ON HIM SAYS HE WAS A KILLER.
01:50:44.709,01:50:46.375,THEY GOT A SIGN ON HIM?
01:50:46.417,01:50:48.667,IN FRONT OF GREELY'S.
01:50:48.709,01:50:51.208,A SIGN ON HIM IN FRONT OF GREELY'S?
01:50:55.208,01:50:58.709,THESE QUESTIONS LITTLE BILL WAS ASKING...

01:51:07.709,01:51:09.417,THEN WHAT?
01:51:09.458,01:51:14.667,A COWBOY COME IN SAYING YOU KILLED QUICK MIKE IN THE SHITHOUSE AT THE BAR T.
01:51:14.709,01:51:18.250,SO LITTLE BILL KILLED HIM FOR WHAT WE DONE.
01:51:18.291,01:51:24.542,"NOT ON PURPOSE, BUT HE STARTED HURTING HIM WORSE, MAKING HIM TELL STUFF."
01:51:24.583,01:51:31.667,"FIRST NED WOULDN'T SAY NOTHING, AND THEN LITTLE BILL HURT HIM SO BAD, HE SAID WHO YOU WAS."
01:51:31.709,01:51:44.375,"HE SAID HOW YOU WAS REALLY WILLIAM MUNNY OUT OF MISSOURI, AND LITTLE BILL SAID THE SAME WILLIAM MUNNY THAT DYNAMITED THE ROCK ISLAND AND PACIFIC IN '69, KILLING WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND ALL?"
01:51:44.417,01:51:47.375,AND NED SAID YOU DONE A LOT WORSE THAN THAT.
01:51:47.417,01:51:53.709,"SAID YOU WAS MORE COLD-BLOODED THAN WILLIAM BONNEY, AND HOW IF HE HURT NED AGAIN, YOU WAS GONNA COME KILL HIM."
01:51:53.750,01:51:57.125,LIKE YOU KILLED A U.S. MARSHAL IN '70.
01:52:00.667,01:52:03.959,"BUT THAT DIDN'T SCARE LITTLE BILL, DID IT?"
01:52:05.458,01:52:07.458,"NO, SIR."
