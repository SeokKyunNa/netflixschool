00:11:01.661,00:11:03.788,It means I don't believe you!
00:11:03.871,00:11:10.086,Why else would you show up with that thing on your back just three days before President Business is going to use the Kragle to end the world?
00:11:10.336,00:11:12.546,President Business is gonna end the world?
00:11:12.629,00:11:14.006,But he's such a good guy.

00:11:26.185,00:11:27.519,This is a misunderstanding.
00:11:27.770,00:11:29.939,"I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy."
00:11:30.022,00:11:34.986,And I'm late to meet my best friends in the whole world and they're probably missing me right now. They're probably out looking around.
00:11:35.069,00:11:37.196,"Hey, where's Emmet? Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"
00:11:37.279,00:11:40.282,"Hey, you know what? Ask all my friends. They'll tell you."

00:11:52.044,00:11:54.922,"JIM: But, you know, he's not, like normal like us. No."
00:11:55.547,00:11:58.217,He's not that special.
00:11:58.885,00:12:01.553,"GAIL: Wait, I'm so confused. Who are we talking about?"
00:12:03.222,00:12:04.515,"Wait, does he work with us?"
00:12:04.723,00:12:06.267,Gail doesn't remember me?
00:12:06.350,00:12:07.726,BARRY: Look at Randy here.
00:12:07.810,00:12:10.146,He likes sausage. That's something.
00:12:10.229,00:12:12.606,Gail is perky. That's something.
00:12:12.689,00:12:20.614,"-And Harry, well... -When you say Harry, I go, When you say the other guy, I go..."
00:12:21.740,00:12:22.950,BARRY: Harry's the best!
00:12:23.034,00:12:25.161,-Harry's got personality. -WORKER: He's weird! He's weird!
00:12:25.411,00:12:28.580,"I know that guy but I know, like, zippy-zap about him."
00:12:28.831,00:12:30.249,We just talked earlier.
00:12:30.541,00:12:34.545,"I mean, all he does is say yes to everything everybody else is doing."
00:12:34.628,00:12:37.173,"You know, he's just sort of a Hmm!"
00:12:37.256,00:12:39.926,"Little bit of a blank slate, I guess."
00:12:40.634,00:12:42.594,"That'll be $42, please."
00:12:43.262,00:12:50.853,We all have something that makes us something and Emmet is nothing.
00:12:52.646,00:12:53.940,There you go.
00:12:54.648,00:12:57.234,-I told you I was a nobody. -BAD COP: Oh.
00:12:57.443,00:12:58.945,It's the perfect cover.
00:12:59.278,00:13:00.988,Cover? Cover for what?
00:13:01.113,00:13:03.657,I can't break him. Take him to the melting chamber.
00:13:09.121,00:13:11.290,You're gonna melt me? Am I gonna die?
00:13:14.293,00:13:16.753,"President Business. I have him right here, sir."
00:13:16.838,00:13:22.218,"Yes, we've told him he'll live so he doesn't try to escape, but, um we're lying to him."
00:13:22.301,00:13:23.928,"Wait, what did he just say?"
00:13:24.011,00:13:25.221,Hold still.
00:13:25.304,00:13:28.307,Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here. You've got the wrong...
00:13:28.390,00:13:30.184,"Ow! Ow, ow, ow!"
00:13:31.853,00:13:33.896,That is gonna start hurting pretty soon.
00:13:58.045,00:13:59.296,"Ow, ow, ow!"
00:14:03.009,00:14:04.010,"No, no, no!"
00:14:12.351,00:14:13.727,It's you?
00:14:13.810,00:14:15.646,Come with me if you wanna not die.
00:14:19.275,00:14:21.485,"Hi, everybody! How's the melting go..."
00:14:21.568,00:14:22.569,"Hey, hey, hey!"
00:14:24.530,00:14:27.992,"I need everyone, repeat, everyone, to go after the Special."
00:14:30.577,00:14:31.578,The tunnel's that way.
00:14:33.414,00:14:34.665,"EMMET: Oh, boy!"
00:14:35.332,00:14:36.500,"Oh, sir, you're brilliant."
00:14:37.168,00:14:38.794,We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
00:14:38.878,00:14:40.337,Ow. Oh.
00:14:50.681,00:14:56.270,"So, uh, didn't catch your name or anything about what you're, uh, up to."
00:14:56.520,00:14:57.897,Or what we're doing here.
00:14:57.980,00:15:03.402,"It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended to be a useless nobody but you can drop the act with me. It's cool."
00:15:03.485,00:15:04.820,"Oh, the act."
00:15:05.571,00:15:06.738,Whoa.
00:15:10.076,00:15:11.660,Jump on. Let's go!
00:15:16.540,00:15:18.792,"EMMET: Hey, uh, I... WYLDSTYLE: Hang on, sir."
00:15:18.875,00:15:21.587,"BAD COP: All units cut him off on Elm, now!"
00:15:21.670,00:15:22.838,Or whenever you can.
00:15:24.590,00:15:26.258,EMMET: Watch out! WYLDSTYLE: Hold on.
00:15:29.261,00:15:31.847,We need to meet up with Vitruvius and tell him the Piece has been found.
00:15:31.931,00:15:32.932,EMMET: Uh-huh.
00:15:33.015,00:15:36.602,BAD COP: They're up on the monorail. Release the copper choppers.
00:15:44.735,00:15:45.945,"EMMET: Oh, no!"
00:15:47.613,00:15:49.949,Will you please tell me what is happening?
00:15:50.032,00:15:52.576,"WYLDSTYLE: I'm rescuing you, sir. You're the one the prophecy spoke of."
00:15:52.659,00:15:53.869,You're the Special.
00:15:53.953,00:15:55.037,Me?
00:15:56.998,00:15:58.749,You found the Piece of Resistance.
00:15:58.832,00:16:07.591,"And the prophecy states that you are the most important, most talented most interesting and most extraordinary person in the universe."
00:16:08.925,00:16:10.219,That's you. Right?
00:16:11.512,00:16:14.556,"Uh, yes. That's me."
00:16:14.931,00:16:16.392,-Great. You drive. -What?
00:16:28.695,00:16:29.696,This is not what I meant!
00:16:38.872,00:16:40.666,"WYLDSTYLE: Oh, no. Look out, Special!"
00:16:40.957,00:16:43.710,"EMMET: Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry!"
00:16:47.506,00:16:48.840,"Wow, he's amazing."
00:16:54.346,00:16:55.514,That was incredible!
00:16:55.597,00:16:58.142,You're even better than the prophecy said you'd be.
00:16:58.225,00:16:59.435,Oh. Really?
00:16:59.685,00:17:01.228,"I'm, uh, I'm Wyldstyle."
00:17:01.603,00:17:03.355,"-Oh, I'm sorry, what was it? -Wyldstyle."
00:17:03.522,00:17:04.856,-Wyldstyle? -Yep.
00:17:04.940,00:17:06.150,"-What are you, a DJ? -No."
00:17:06.233,00:17:08.402,"-Oh, that's your name? Wyldstyle? -Yeah."
00:17:08.485,00:17:09.986,"Like on your birth certificate, it says Wyldstyle."
00:17:10.071,00:17:11.155,Let's not talk about my name!
00:17:11.238,00:17:12.448,Don't let the Special get away.
00:17:12.531,00:17:13.699,"ROBOT: Sir, we've blocked the freeway."
00:17:14.283,00:17:15.326,"Hang on, sir!"
00:17:16.202,00:17:17.328,EMMET: What are you doing?
00:17:19.288,00:17:20.997,-Let's fly! -EMMET: Whoa!
00:17:22.291,00:17:23.834,WYLDSTYLE: Head for the secret tunnel.
00:17:24.085,00:17:25.294,"EMMET: Uh, these are the city limits."
00:17:25.377,00:17:27.129,WYLDSTYLE: Let's just head for the tunnel.
00:17:27.754,00:17:29.673,You want me to drive into that weird swirly hole?
00:17:29.756,00:17:32.343,-Are you insane? -Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!
00:17:32.426,00:17:35.887,I can't do this! That is against the instructions.
00:17:37.389,00:17:39.891,"-Wait, what's your favorite restaurant? -Any chain restaurant."
00:17:39.975,00:17:41.310,-Favorite TV show? -Where Are My Pants?
00:17:43.770,00:17:44.980,"Oh, no!"
00:17:53.489,00:17:55.532,"Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!"
00:18:35.531,00:18:37.408,Wait. Where are we?
00:18:39.701,00:18:41.453,This is so weir... Ow!
00:18:41.537,00:18:43.830,You're not the Special. You lied to me.
00:18:44.206,00:18:45.791,"Well, I mean, it depends... It really kind of depends..."
00:18:45.874,00:18:47.751,"You're not even a Master Builder, are you?"
00:18:47.834,00:18:49.836,"Uh, I mean, I know what a Master Builder is."
00:18:50.212,00:18:53.299,Why don't you tell me what it is? That way I could see if you're right.
00:18:53.382,00:18:55.217,You've ruined the prophecy.
00:18:56.718,00:18:59.305,"Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just..."
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.432,You made being special sound so good.
00:19:01.515,00:19:04.560,And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe.
00:19:05.227,00:19:08.063,"You were? Well, here's the thing."
00:19:08.147,00:19:10.857,How do we know for sure that I'm not the Special?
00:19:12.651,00:19:14.361,COWBOY: Y'all want a giant turkey leg?
00:19:14.903,00:19:16.572,Do you have any idea what that does to your colon?
00:19:18.990,00:19:21.868,"-Oh, my G-O-S-H. -WYLDSTYLE: Just put the hat on."
00:19:22.494,00:19:25.038,"Oh, and this. And this. And this."
00:19:26.665,00:19:28.417,"And, by the way, I have a boyfriend."
00:19:28.500,00:19:30.711,"Uh, I'm not sure exactly why you'd bring that up."
00:19:30.794,00:19:32.128,It's super serious.
00:19:32.213,00:19:34.298,-You do not want to mess with him. -Okay.
00:19:34.381,00:19:35.841,So don't get any ideas.
00:19:38.344,00:19:39.386,Wait!
00:19:39.470,00:19:41.597,ROBBER: Stick 'em up. Keep those hands where I can see them.
00:19:41.680,00:19:46.602,"EMMET: Hey, uh, listen. You think you can explain why I'm dressed like this and what those big words in the sky were all about?"
00:19:46.685,00:19:49.230,"And, like, where we are in time."
00:19:51.773,00:19:54.610,"WYLDSTYLE: Your home, Bricksburg, is one of many realms in the universe."
00:19:54.693,00:19:58.364,"There's also this one, Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club, Viking's Landing, Clown Town."
00:19:58.447,00:19:59.781,A bunch of others we don't need to mention.
00:19:59.865,00:20:07.373,"-Mmm-hmm. -Lord Business, or as you think you know him, President Business, stole the Kragle, the most powerful object in the universe."
00:20:07.456,00:20:08.957,"Blah, blah, blah."
00:20:09.040,00:20:12.002,Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.
00:20:12.085,00:20:14.421,-Piece of Resistance is the Special. -EMMET: Mmm-hmm.
00:20:14.505,00:20:17.132,I'm so pretty. I like you.
00:20:17.216,00:20:19.635,But I'm angry with you for some reason.
00:20:19.718,00:20:21.136,"-At the end of the universe, -EMMET: Mmm-hmm."
00:20:21.220,00:20:24.973,put the Piece of Resistance onto the Kragle and disarm it forever.
00:20:25.056,00:20:26.225,Great.
00:20:26.308,00:20:30.771,I think I got it but just in case tell me the whole thing again. I wasn't listening.
00:20:32.731,00:20:39.321,WYLDSTYLE: Okay. All the people of the universe were once free to travel and mingle and build whatever they wanted.
00:20:39.405,00:20:42.616,But President Business was confused by all the chaos.
00:20:42.699,00:20:47.413,So he erected walls between the worlds and became obsessed with order and perfection.
00:20:47.496,00:20:51.250,And he stole the mysterious -secret super weapon called... -LORD BUSINESS: The Kragle!
00:20:51.333,00:20:56.588,"WYLDSTYLE: And he hired Bad Cop to hunt down all the Master Builders, who were always changing everything."
00:20:56.672,00:21:01.552,"And those of us who remained well, we went into hiding. Built the tunnels to survive."
00:21:01.635,00:21:03.679,And we search for the Piece of Resistance.
00:21:03.762,00:21:06.432,The only thing that can stop the Kragle.
00:21:06.765,00:21:08.016,Kragle. I know that.
00:21:08.099,00:21:10.561,It might have been that cop. He said something about the Kragle.
00:21:10.644,00:21:15.566,President Business was going to use the Kragle I can't make any sense of it.
00:21:15.649,00:21:16.858,Taco Tuesday.
00:21:16.942,00:21:19.320,I knew that was suspicious. There's no time to lose.
00:21:19.403,00:21:22.238,We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late.
00:21:22.323,00:21:23.782,Okay.
00:21:35.294,00:21:41.049,"President Business, we're trying to locate the fugitive but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database."
00:21:41.132,00:21:43.009,Diabolical.
00:21:43.093,00:21:47.889,"Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office -in 23 seconds. Ciao. -Will do, sir."
00:21:48.056,00:21:49.891,"ROBOT: Coffee sales are through the roof, sir."
00:21:49.975,00:21:52.519,Glad to hear it. Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!
00:21:52.603,00:21:53.895,The roof team is on it.
00:21:53.979,00:21:56.357,"Sir, can you approve this poster for Taco Tuesday?"
00:21:56.440,00:21:57.566,Perfect. Whoo!
00:21:57.649,00:21:59.776,"-I love everyone in this room. -ROBOTS: We love you, sir!"
00:21:59.860,00:22:01.403,"LORD BUSINESS: Hey guys, great job on the radio station."
00:22:01.487,00:22:04.531,"ROBOTS: Thank you, sir. We love listening to this song over and over again."
00:22:04.656,00:22:05.657,"Keep it up, guys."
00:22:05.741,00:22:12.247,"Honey, where are my Hilarious. That never gets old."
00:22:12.331,00:22:13.415,It does not.
00:22:13.499,00:22:16.001,FEMALE ROBOT: Bad Cop is waiting for you in your office.
00:22:16.084,00:22:17.503,Wonderful. Fantastic.
00:22:17.586,00:22:19.630,Would you cancel my 2 o'clock?
00:22:19.713,00:22:23.008,This next meeting could run a little bit deadly.
00:22:30.891,00:22:31.975,COMPUTER: Activate helmet.
00:22:33.268,00:22:34.561,Light sequence.
00:22:34.811,00:22:35.854,Flame test.
00:22:38.815,00:22:39.941,Bad Cop.
00:22:40.025,00:22:42.277,"Lord Business. I know the Special got away, but..."
00:22:42.360,00:22:44.279,Don't be so serious.
00:22:44.362,00:22:45.822,Where's the other guy?
00:22:45.906,00:22:47.824,"-Hey, friend. -LORD BUSINESS: Hey, buddy!"
00:22:47.908,00:22:49.660,"-I missed you. -Aw, did you really?"
00:22:49.743,00:22:51.662,Have I ever shown you my relic collection?
00:22:51.745,00:22:53.079,Nope. I don't think you have.
00:22:53.163,00:22:54.915,Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.
00:22:54.998,00:22:57.751,This one is the Cloak of Ban Da'Id.
00:22:57.834,00:22:59.335,I hear it's super painful to take off.
00:22:59.420,00:23:01.212,"-You wanna try it on? -Well, um..."
00:23:01.296,00:23:02.673,"No, but thank you."
00:23:02.756,00:23:05.634,"LORD BUSINESS: We've done some great work over the years together, Bad Cop."
00:23:05.717,00:23:09.471,Capturing all those Master Builders and torturing them and whatnot.
00:23:09.555,00:23:13.475,"-Thank you, sir. -Although you did let the Piece of Resistance go."
00:23:13.559,00:23:15.351,The one thing that can ruin my plans.
00:23:18.396,00:23:20.148,That's super frustrating.
00:23:20.231,00:23:30.909,It makes me just wanna pick up whoever is standing closest to me and just throw them through this window and out into the infinite abyss of nothingness!
00:23:33.954,00:23:35.997,I wanna do it so bad.
00:23:36.081,00:23:38.333,"I know you do, sir. Please, please don't."
00:23:38.416,00:23:41.545,"And it's not just you, Bad Cop, that keeps messing up my plans."
00:23:41.628,00:23:45.423,People everywhere are always messing with my stuff.
00:23:46.049,00:23:48.594,But I have a way to fix that.
00:23:48.969,00:23:52.263,A way to keep things exactly the way they are supposed to be.
00:23:53.098,00:23:54.600,Permanently.
00:23:54.933,00:24:00.313,LORD BUSINESS: Behold the most powerful weapon of all the relics.
00:24:01.565,00:24:03.734,The Kragle!
00:24:08.113,00:24:11.199,"LORD BUSINESS: As you can see, they're loading the Kragle in a big machine, upstairs."
00:24:11.282,00:24:15.203,"I call it, the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer."
00:24:15.286,00:24:16.705,Or TAKOS.
00:24:16.788,00:24:17.956,The S is silent.
00:24:18.499,00:24:26.673,"So on Taco Tuesday, it's going to spray the Kragle over everyone and everything with a bunch of super-scary nozzles like this one!"
00:24:27.048,00:24:29.885,"-I'll show you how it works. -Sir, I don't know if this is necessary."
00:24:29.968,00:24:32.554,"Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you."
00:24:32.638,00:24:34.055,I'll do it on your parents.
00:24:35.181,00:24:36.182,What?
00:24:36.767,00:24:38.268,"-Hi, son. -Hi!"
00:24:38.351,00:24:39.728,How's it going in the big city?
00:24:40.103,00:24:42.147,Mommy. Daddy. What are you doing here?
00:24:42.480,00:24:44.733,"Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally."
00:24:44.816,00:24:47.068,-Like you're going about your day. -Gotcha.
00:24:47.152,00:24:49.070,Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.
00:24:49.154,00:24:52.574,"Ma, scoot two steps in to the right. Pa?"
00:24:52.658,00:24:55.619,-Uh-huh? -Why do... Whenever I talk to Ma -you start to move. -I'm sorry.
00:24:55.702,00:24:57.746,-Get back to where you were! -Here?
00:24:57.829,00:24:59.289,Perfect. That's great. You can't do anything better.
00:24:59.372,00:25:00.999,-There's no reason why you should move. -Right.
00:25:01.082,00:25:03.919,"Now, Ma, hand on his shoulder. And you..."
00:25:04.002,00:25:06.254,"Pa, you just moved and you've just wrecked it!"
00:25:06.337,00:25:07.422,-Uh-huh. -You wrecked it!
00:25:07.505,00:25:09.507,"Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?"
00:25:09.591,00:25:13.303,All I'm asking for is total perfection.
00:25:13.845,00:25:15.430,Send in a micro-manager!
00:25:17.808,00:25:19.475,MICRO-MANAGER: Commencing micro-management.
00:25:22.771,00:25:24.480,"LORD BUSINESS: Hold still, you guys."
00:25:27.067,00:25:30.528,And then I just spray them with the TAKOS.
00:25:32.447,00:25:33.907,"Oh, Pa, hold me."
00:25:33.990,00:25:36.868,"Oh, darling, I can't move me legs."
00:25:37.327,00:25:39.495,"-Does that upset you, Bad Cop? -Um."
00:25:39.580,00:25:42.666,"Surely you feel bad for your parents, and you wanna help them, don't you?"
00:25:43.208,00:25:46.712,"We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all."
00:25:47.128,00:25:51.842,"Go ahead, finish the job."
00:25:52.217,00:25:53.468,"Of course, sir."
00:25:53.551,00:25:54.803,"No, I don't want to."
00:25:54.886,00:25:56.638,-You have to. -I don't want to.
00:25:56.722,00:25:58.348,-Would you please be quiet? -I can't.
00:25:58.431,00:25:59.808,-You must. Shut it! -But they...
00:25:59.891,00:26:01.852,"-It's not nice. -It's your job, man."
00:26:01.935,00:26:03.103,I can't do it.
00:26:03.519,00:26:04.938,-They're innocent. -Just as I thought.
00:26:05.021,00:26:08.316,"Your Good Cop side's making you soft, Bad Cop."
00:26:08.399,00:26:13.947,Robots! Bring me the fleece-crested Scepter of Q-Teep and the Po-Lish Remover of Na-Il.
00:26:14.030,00:26:16.157,You've already let the Special get away once.
00:26:16.241,00:26:17.283,Sir.
00:26:17.367,00:26:19.535,LORD BUSINESS: I'm just gonna make sure it doesn't happen again.
00:26:19.620,00:26:21.830,No more Mr. Nice Guy!
00:26:26.877,00:26:27.878,"Oh, son!"
00:26:27.961,00:26:35.176,"On Taco Tuesday, I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe so that everyone will stop messing with my stuff!"
00:26:35.761,00:26:41.975,Are you gonna be with me or are you gonna be stuck having a tea party with your mom and dad?
00:26:42.433,00:26:43.434,Son?
00:26:44.645,00:26:45.729,"Sorry, Dad."
00:26:47.022,00:26:48.273,I have a job to do.
00:27:06.291,00:27:08.626,WYLDSTYLE: All you have to do is blend in and act like you belong here.
00:27:08.710,00:27:09.878,"EMMET: Ah, perfect."
00:27:12.630,00:27:14.299,"Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!"
00:27:14.382,00:27:15.759,"Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun."
00:27:16.092,00:27:17.969,"Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow."
00:27:18.303,00:27:20.430,"-What are they looking at? -WYLDSTYLE: I, I, I made a mistake."
00:27:20.513,00:27:22.265,You should just be still. Act like a stool.
00:27:22.348,00:27:23.558,"-Wait! -Howdy, guys!"
00:27:23.641,00:27:24.851,"-Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk. -Come sit on me."
00:27:24.935,00:27:26.644,"Stools don't talk. Okay, shh."
00:27:27.478,00:27:28.980,Let me show you how it's done.
00:27:34.319,00:27:35.403,MAN: What a lady!
00:27:36.863,00:27:41.409,"Okay, let me just find the wizard and get this over with."
00:27:47.165,00:27:48.709,-Ooh! -There he is.
00:27:49.334,00:27:51.086,-Vitruvius. -Who?
00:27:51.169,00:27:53.797,"I've never heard of that man, whom I am not."
00:27:53.880,00:27:55.506,-Who are you? -It's me.
00:27:55.841,00:27:58.176,I am a blind man and cannot see.
00:27:58.634,00:28:01.054,-It's Wyldstyle. -Are you a DJ?
00:28:01.137,00:28:03.056,"-What? Why does everybody? -Oh, wait, wait."
00:28:03.139,00:28:06.309,Are you the student I used to have who was so insecure she kept changing her name?
00:28:06.392,00:28:07.435,"No, no, no."
00:28:07.518,00:28:09.145,"-First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle. -No. Never."
00:28:09.229,00:28:11.314,"Then Neversmile, then Freakface, then Snazzypants."
00:28:11.397,00:28:12.482,"Okay. Hey, All right, yes."
00:28:12.565,00:28:14.275,Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.
00:28:23.284,00:28:25.036,"EMMET: Oh, man."
00:28:25.912,00:28:28.248,You have a very weirdly decorated place.
00:28:28.331,00:28:29.374,VITRUVIUS: Thank you.
00:28:29.457,00:28:32.710,"WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, we have found the Piece of Resistance."
00:28:32.794,00:28:34.295,"-Is it true? -WYLDSTYLE: Yes, but..."
00:28:34.379,00:28:38.925,Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that you are the Special.
00:28:39.009,00:28:41.136,"The embodiment of good, foiler of evil."
00:28:41.219,00:28:46.349,"The most talented, most brilliant most important person in the universe."
00:28:46.892,00:28:51.479,That would be great but Emmet is the one who found the Piece.
00:28:53.732,00:28:57.027,The prophecy states that you are the Special.
00:28:57.110,00:28:59.195,-The most talented... -I'm not sure he's the Special.
00:28:59.279,00:29:01.239,Actually because he's not even a Master Builder. Watch.
00:29:01.656,00:29:04.409,"Emmet, just given what's around you -build something simple. -Okay."
00:29:04.492,00:29:05.576,-Like an awesome race car. -Great.
00:29:05.660,00:29:07.120,-Go. -Do you have the instructions?
00:29:07.203,00:29:10.749,"No. You must create the instructions in your mind, my liege."
00:29:11.249,00:29:13.668,Ah. Okay. Race car.
00:29:13.752,00:29:14.961,Um.
00:29:15.045,00:29:17.588,"Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here."
00:29:17.881,00:29:21.968,Don't see a wheel or...
00:29:26.765,00:29:27.933,Three more wheels.
00:29:31.144,00:29:33.772,Of course not. Not if you keep telling him he can't.
00:29:33.855,00:29:35.273,He needs to see that he can.
00:29:35.356,00:29:36.817,What are you doing?
00:29:36.900,00:29:38.526,-VITRUVIUS: We are entering your mind. -What?
00:29:38.609,00:29:42.738,To prove that you have the unlocked potential to be a Master Builder.
00:29:50.288,00:29:52.373,"EMMET: Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?"
00:29:52.457,00:29:54.918,-It's big. I must be smart. -WYLDSTYLE: Mmm-hmm.
00:29:55.418,00:29:57.753,VITRUVIUS: I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.
00:29:57.838,00:30:00.381,I don't think he's ever had an original thought. In his life.
00:30:01.967,00:30:06.179,"For instance, one time I wanted to have a bunch of my friends over to watch TV."
00:30:06.262,00:30:09.850,Not unlike this TV that just showed up magically.
00:30:09.933,00:30:16.564,"And not everybody can fit on my one couch and I thought to myself, Well, what if there was such a thing as a bunk bed but as a couch?"
00:30:16.647,00:30:19.109,Introducing the double-decker couch.
00:30:19.192,00:30:21.987,So everyone could watch TV together and be buddies!
00:30:22.946,00:30:25.073,That is literally the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
00:30:25.156,00:30:27.700,"Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this."
00:30:27.783,00:30:30.620,That idea is just the worst.
00:30:30.829,00:30:33.999,There must be something around here that proves his potential.
00:30:34.457,00:30:38.211,If the Man Upstairs chose him to be the Special there must be a reason.
00:30:38.294,00:30:39.504,-EMMET: Who's the Man Upstairs? -See?
00:30:39.587,00:30:41.422,He doesn't even know about the Man Upstairs.
00:30:41.506,00:30:45.260,"Does he have, like, super-gross hands that look like they're made out of big pink sausages?"
00:30:47.637,00:30:50.223,Wait. You've seen the...
00:30:51.307,00:30:53.768,Whoa! That's what I was just thinking about.
00:30:53.852,00:30:54.895,How did you...
00:30:54.978,00:30:56.146,I had this weird dream when I touched the Piece.
00:30:56.229,00:30:58.439,"Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep, so it wasn't really a dream."
00:30:58.523,00:31:00.566,"Emmet, you had a vision."
00:31:00.650,00:31:01.692,I did?
00:31:01.776,00:31:16.249,"Master Builders spend years training themselves to clear their minds enough to have even a fleeting glimpse of the Man Upstairs and yet, your mind is already so prodigiously empty that there is nothing in it to clear away in the first place."
00:31:16.332,00:31:20.253,With proper training you could become a great Master Builder.
00:31:20.336,00:31:21.421,I could?
00:31:21.504,00:31:23.756,"VITRUVIUS: The prophecy chose you, Emmet."
00:31:24.507,00:31:28.011,But I can't do any of the stuff that the prophecy says I'm supposed to do.
00:31:28.428,00:31:31.890,All you have to do is to believe.
00:31:32.098,00:31:35.226,Then you will see everything.
00:31:36.519,00:31:37.896,"Are you ready, my son?"
00:31:41.232,00:31:42.943,"Yes, I am."
00:31:43.526,00:31:44.777,I think.
00:31:45.028,00:31:46.821,Then we haven't a moment to lose.
00:31:47.072,00:31:50.533,We must assemble the Master Builders.
00:31:51.284,00:31:53.369,Do you think Zeppelins are a bad investment?
00:32:05.840,00:32:07.926,Any of you fellas seen this guy?
00:32:10.636,00:32:12.097,"SHERIFF: Wait a minute, partner."
00:32:12.180,00:32:13.848,Draw a cowboy hat on him.
00:32:20.438,00:32:22.648,These mechanical birds will get our message out.
00:32:22.732,00:32:29.280,They will go to an Internet cafe who will meet us in the secret realm of Cloud Cuckooland.
00:32:29.780,00:32:32.283,Cuckooland? Wait. What happened to that whole training part?
00:32:32.367,00:32:33.909,"Don't worry, Emmet."
00:32:43.128,00:32:44.129,On three.
00:32:44.212,00:32:45.213,One.
00:32:51.927,00:32:54.472,"-Whew. I think we're in the clear. -BAD COP: Freeze, turkeys."
00:32:56.099,00:32:57.433,All I want is the Piece of Resistance.
00:32:57.517,00:32:59.978,We would rather he died than give it to you.
00:33:00.061,00:33:02.397,I would not rather he died.
00:33:02.480,00:33:05.525,"Look, everybody, we can do this the easy way, or we can do it..."
00:33:05.608,00:33:06.609,"WYLDSTYLE: Go, run!"
00:33:06.692,00:33:08.278,They took the hard way. Fire!
00:33:08.361,00:33:09.362,Fire!
00:33:10.571,00:33:12.490,"WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?"
00:33:12.573,00:33:14.575,VITRUVIUS: Head for the big bright thing in the sky.
00:33:14.659,00:33:16.452,"EMMET: You mean the sun? VITRUVIUS: Yeah. Yeah, that's it."
00:33:16.536,00:33:17.870,"WYLDSTYLE: Let's get out of here. Here, use this."
00:33:17.953,00:33:19.080,"EMMET: What? Wait, hey..."
00:33:19.164,00:33:20.831,-What are you doing? -WYLDSTYLE: Let's go!
00:33:22.500,00:33:24.210,I don't know what I'm doing.
00:33:27.547,00:33:29.674,Goodbye. Boom!
00:33:36.264,00:33:37.473,"Oh, dang!"
00:33:41.227,00:33:43.354,I've got pigs! I hate pigs!
00:33:43.438,00:33:45.398,"Guys, quit playing around in the mud. I could use your help."
00:33:45.690,00:33:48.193,"Wyldstyle, we could really use your help!"
00:34:06.627,00:34:07.670,PIGS: Oink!
00:34:08.879,00:34:10.756,"WYLDSTYLE: Vitruvius, they're gaining on us. Build something!"
00:34:10.840,00:34:11.841,Let Emmet try!
00:34:11.924,00:34:14.635,"No, let's not let Emmet try! I haven't had any training."
00:34:14.719,00:34:15.761,That's okay.
00:34:15.845,00:34:18.013,We'll start with how to become a Master Builder.
00:34:18.098,00:34:20.516,Step one. Trust your instincts.
00:34:20.600,00:34:23.519,"-Okay, okay. Um... -Build something! Build something!"
00:34:23.603,00:34:25.063,A-ha. Take that!
00:34:28.816,00:34:31.486,VITRUVIUS: Unless your instincts are terrible.
00:34:38.118,00:34:39.494,VITRUVIUS: No! The wheel!
00:34:44.332,00:34:46.542,I can't control it much longer!
00:34:46.792,00:34:50.171,"Emmet, we need to attach the wheel to something that spins around."
00:34:50.255,00:34:53.133,VITRUVIUS: We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.
00:34:53.216,00:34:55.176,We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.
00:34:55.260,00:34:57.678,We need to attach the wheel to something that spins around.
00:35:01.266,00:35:02.433,Oh.
00:35:03.934,00:35:05.936,"WYLDSTYLE: Emmet, where are you going?"
00:35:09.649,00:35:10.941,Hang tight.
00:35:12.402,00:35:13.903,SHERIFF: Dagnabit!
00:35:16.614,00:35:18.533,"Well done, Emmet."
00:35:18.616,00:35:19.700,Hey! I did it.
00:35:20.160,00:35:21.952,Wow. You actually did it.
00:35:33.131,00:35:34.340,"WYLDSTYLE: Oh, no."
00:35:34.424,00:35:35.966,Get off my train.
00:35:36.050,00:35:37.218,WYLDSTYLE: Run!
00:35:42.765,00:35:43.933,EMMET: Wyldstyle!
00:35:46.186,00:35:47.770,Ow whee!
00:35:49.522,00:35:51.357,WYLDSTYLE: Quick! That piece! Give me that piece.
00:35:51.441,00:35:52.483,BAD COP: Huh?
00:35:53.359,00:35:55.278,WYLDSTYLE: Build a ramp!
00:36:01.242,00:36:02.327,What the heck?
00:36:02.410,00:36:03.786,Rest in pieces.
00:36:05.913,00:36:06.956,"-Uh. -Oh, no."
00:36:07.039,00:36:08.249,"EMMET: Wait. No, no, no."
00:36:16.341,00:36:17.383,Hey.
00:36:17.925,00:36:19.969,Thanks for saving my life back there.
00:36:20.052,00:36:24.349,"Even if, you know eventually it turned out to be pointless."
00:36:25.516,00:36:30.980,"Well, for what it's worth this has been about the greatest 15 minutes of my life."
00:36:37.737,00:36:38.738,What the...
00:36:41.949,00:36:43.451,"Relax, everybody, I'm here."
00:36:43.534,00:36:44.535,Batman!
00:36:44.619,00:36:45.661,"-What's up, babe? -Babe!"
00:36:45.745,00:36:47.913,"-What? -Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet."
00:36:47.997,00:36:50.250,"Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman."
00:36:50.333,00:36:51.792,I'm Batman.
00:36:56.547,00:36:58.466,"Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?"
00:36:58.549,00:37:00.926,"It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?"
00:37:01.010,00:37:02.094,BAD COP: There he is.
00:37:02.177,00:37:04.680,"-Police to meet you, Bad Cop. -Batman!"
00:37:04.764,00:37:06.557,The pleasure is all spine.
00:37:06.641,00:37:08.851,"BATMAN: Guess what, you big dumb baby."
00:37:09.269,00:37:11.646,Your car is a baby carriage.
00:37:12.938,00:37:14.690,"Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone."
00:37:14.774,00:37:15.816,"BATMAN: Hey, babe. EMMET: What?"
00:37:15.900,00:37:16.901,Let's hold hands.
00:37:20.029,00:37:21.322,"So, uh."
00:37:21.406,00:37:23.658,"Hey, guys, I think we're about to crash into the sun."
00:37:23.741,00:37:25.535,"BATMAN: Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool."
00:37:32.250,00:37:35.670,"EMMET: Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland? I don't see any clouds. Or cuckoos."
00:37:35.753,00:37:38.047,"No, no, this is Middle Zealand."
00:37:38.130,00:37:44.679,"A wondrous land full of knights, castles, mutton torture weapons, poverty, leeches, illiteracy and, um..."
00:37:44.762,00:37:46.347,EMMET: Dragon!
00:37:47.598,00:37:49.099,"VITRUVIUS: Yeah, that too."
00:37:51.977,00:37:55.523,"Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland, we'll raise an army -of Master Builders to... -Yeah, yeah."
00:37:55.606,00:37:58.693,"Anyway, you guys gotta check out these new subwoofers I installed in the back."
00:37:58.776,00:38:01.028,I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!
00:38:02.697,00:38:04.365,EMMET: Can you turn that down a little bit?
00:38:04.449,00:38:06.784,This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.
00:38:08.744,00:38:10.162,It's about how I'm an orphan.
00:38:10.245,00:38:13.624,"No parents This is real music, Emmet."
00:38:13.708,00:38:16.419,"Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding."
00:38:16.502,00:38:18.629,"Well, I'm dark and brooding, too."
00:38:20.881,00:38:22.842,VITRUVIUS: So you're gonna drive up the curved part...
00:38:22.925,00:38:25.386,Super rich VITRUVIUS: Take it all the way to the top...
00:38:25.470,00:38:31.976,"Kind of makes it better VITRUVIUS: Friends, welcome to Cloud Cuckooland. Now..."
00:38:35.730,00:38:37.690,I just need to give the secret knock.
00:38:49.660,00:38:50.911,Okay.
00:38:58.252,00:38:59.337,EMMET: I'm just gonna come right out.
00:38:59.420,00:39:02.507,"I have no idea what's going on, or what this place is at all."
00:39:02.590,00:39:09.221,Hi! I am Princess Unikitty and I welcome you all to Cloud Cuckooland.
00:39:11.766,00:39:13.934,EMMET: There's no signs or anything.
00:39:14.018,00:39:15.895,How does anyone know what not to do?
00:39:15.978,00:39:18.898,UNIKITTY: Here in Cloud Cuckooland there are no rules.
00:39:18.981,00:39:29.617,"There's no government, no babysitters, no bedtimes, no frowny faces, no bushy mustaches and no negativity of any kind."
00:39:29.909,00:39:31.952,You just said the word no like a thousand times.
00:39:32.036,00:39:34.121,And there's also no consistency.
00:39:34.204,00:39:36.331,I hate this place.
00:39:36.582,00:39:40.503,Any idea is a good idea except the not happy ones.
00:39:40.586,00:39:47.593,"Those you push down deep inside where you'll never, ever, ever ever find them."
00:39:47.677,00:39:50.388,Your fellow Master Builders are gathered in the Dog.
00:39:50.596,00:39:51.681,The what?
00:39:56.310,00:39:58.062,"-Bonjour. -Girl, what are you doing, right now?"
00:39:58.145,00:40:00.314,"-Hey, Superman! -Oh, hey. What's up?"
00:40:00.398,00:40:02.357,"-Lantern. Green Lantern. -Yeah, yeah."
00:40:02.442,00:40:03.484,You wanna sit together at the meeting?
00:40:03.568,00:40:06.946,"Um, I have to, I have to go back to Krypton."
00:40:07.029,00:40:08.322,"Didn't, didn't Krypton blow up?"
00:40:08.406,00:40:16.121,"VITRUVIUS: My fellow Master Builders, including but not limited to, Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady, Gandalf, Swamp Creature -1980-something Space Guy... -Hello!"
00:40:16.205,00:40:23.838,2002 NBA All-Stars You have traveled far to be here for a moment of great import.
00:40:23.921,00:40:33.138,We have learned that Lord Business plans to unleash a fully weaponized Kragle on Taco Tuesday to end the world as we know it.
00:40:35.600,00:40:37.059,Green Ninja. Milhouse.
00:40:37.142,00:40:40.813,"Nice Vampire. Michelangelo, Michelangelo and Cleopatra."
00:40:40.896,00:40:42.898,There is yet one hope.
00:40:42.982,00:40:44.859,The Special has arisen.
00:40:46.527,00:40:48.529,Have the young man step forward.
00:40:48.613,00:40:50.948,"-As you wish, Dubbledore. -I'm Gandalf!"
00:40:51.031,00:40:52.783,-It's pronounced Dumbledore. -Dubbadore?
00:40:52.867,00:40:54.368,"No, Dumbledore."
00:40:54.452,00:40:56.245,-Thought you said Dubbadore. -Vitruvius!
00:40:56.328,00:40:58.539,You gotta write all that down. I'm not gonna remember any of it.
00:40:58.623,00:40:59.957,But here we go.
00:41:01.751,00:41:04.754,The Special will now give an eloquent speech.
00:41:09.592,00:41:11.135,"Go ahead, man. You got this."
00:41:13.053,00:41:14.054,Okay.
00:41:20.478,00:41:22.396,Hello. I'm Emmet.
00:41:23.188,00:41:25.065,"Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance."
00:41:34.617,00:41:35.785,Thank you.
00:41:36.326,00:41:46.170,"Well, uh, I know that I, for one am very excited to work with you guys to get into the Octan Tower, find the Kragle and put this thing on the thing."
00:41:46.253,00:41:48.881,"And I know it's going to be really hard, but..."
00:41:48.964,00:41:50.174,Really hard?
00:41:51.676,00:41:55.179,Wiping ye bum with a hook for a hand is really hard.
00:41:55.262,00:41:56.847,This be impossible.
00:41:57.181,00:42:02.520,The last time we tried to storm Lord Business' office we used every plan we could conceive.
00:42:02.603,00:42:05.856,The result was a massacre too terrible to speak of.
00:42:06.566,00:42:09.652,-Who are you? -The name be Metal Beard.
00:42:09.735,00:42:12.237,And I'll tell you me tale of woe.
00:42:12.697,00:42:14.198,"VITRUVIUS: Oh, great, here we go again."
00:42:14.281,00:42:30.297,I arrived at the foot of the Tower with Me Hearty Master Builder crew only to find the Kragle was all the way up on the infinityeth floor guarded by a robot army and security measures of every kind imaginable.
00:42:30.631,00:42:31.757,Lasers.
00:42:32.382,00:42:33.718,Sharks.
00:42:34.134,00:42:35.928,Laser sharks.
00:42:36.095,00:42:37.722,Overbearing assistants.
00:42:38.848,00:42:43.936,"And strange, dangerous relics, that entrap, snap and zap."
00:42:44.311,00:42:48.232,And there be a mysterious room called the Think Tank.
00:42:49.358,00:42:52.737,I barely made it out of that room with just me head!
00:42:54.822,00:42:56.281,And organs.
00:42:56.907,00:42:57.908,Okay.
00:42:57.992,00:43:06.250,"I had to replace every part of my once-strapping, virile pirate body with this useless hunk of garbage ye see before ye."
00:43:06.667,00:43:19.554,"So if ye think it'd be a good idea to return to that forsaken place, Special, what idea have ye that be better than the ideas of 100 of our fallen Master Builder brothers?"
00:43:20.222,00:43:21.556,"Well, uh..."
00:43:21.641,00:43:24.518,"Well, technically I'm not exactly a Master Builder yet."
00:43:27.229,00:43:29.607,EMMET: Please! Everyone! Please!
00:43:30.315,00:43:31.358,Rubbish!
00:43:31.441,00:43:32.860,"Yes, it's true."
00:43:33.611,00:43:35.821,I may not be a Master Builder.
00:43:36.530,00:43:41.451,"I may not have a lot of experience, fighting or leading or coming up with plans."
00:43:42.411,00:43:44.371,Or having ideas in general.
00:43:45.205,00:43:47.625,"In fact, I'm not all that smart."
00:43:48.542,00:43:51.671,And I'm not what you'd call a creative type.
00:43:52.630,00:43:55.925,"Plus, generally unskilled."
00:43:56.008,00:43:57.051,Huh?
00:43:57.134,00:44:00.930,"EMMET: Also, scared and cowardly."
00:44:02.264,00:44:03.473,I know what you're thinking.
00:44:04.141,00:44:08.562,He is the least qualified person in the world to lead us.
00:44:09.479,00:44:10.898,And you are right.
00:44:11.440,00:44:14.151,This is supposed to make us feel better?
00:44:14.652,00:44:16.696,"No, there was about to be a but."
00:44:16.779,00:44:18.656,-You're a butt! -Yes.
00:44:19.031,00:44:21.158,You all be on your own!
00:44:21.241,00:44:23.744,I be leaving this lost cause.
00:44:26.080,00:44:27.164,Why are you leaving?
00:44:27.247,00:44:30.751,A house divided against itself would be better than this.
00:44:31.961,00:44:33.253,EMMET: Abraham Lincoln!
00:44:33.337,00:44:35.255,You bring your space chair right back here!
00:44:35.673,00:44:37.299,"Come on, guys!"
00:44:37.632,00:44:38.926,We can still do this.
00:44:39.009,00:44:40.344,Ooh! Right?
00:44:40.552,00:44:42.262,MAN 1: You're not even a bit special.
00:44:42.346,00:44:44.932,"Well, you were right about him being a ding-dong."
00:44:45.224,00:44:47.226,MAN 2: You're a huge disappointment.
00:44:47.810,00:44:50.520,MAN 3: Get him out of here. I don't wanna look at him.
00:44:53.858,00:44:56.068,"Well, at least it can't get any worse."
00:44:58.278,00:44:59.404,I was wrong.
00:45:03.033,00:45:04.368,It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!
00:45:05.702,00:45:07.955,BAD COP: Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.
00:45:08.497,00:45:09.581,EMMET: Whoa. How did he...
00:45:09.832,00:45:12.501,"WYLDSTYLE: Go! Run! Come on, everyone! Protect the Special."
00:45:12.584,00:45:13.961,What's that on his ankle?
00:45:15.212,00:45:16.713,It's a tracking device.
00:45:17.464,00:45:19.049,Take the Master Builders prisoners.
00:45:19.133,00:45:20.760,"Oh, he led them right to us."
00:45:21.093,00:45:23.137,"Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault."
00:45:23.220,00:45:26.431,You are the worst leader I've ever seen. To the Batmobile!
00:45:28.558,00:45:30.269,-Dang it. -To the invisible jet!
00:45:32.354,00:45:34.023,-Dang it! -Every man for himself.
00:45:34.106,00:45:36.316,"No, we must protect the Piece."
00:45:36.400,00:45:38.360,"Shaq, do you know what time it is?"
00:45:38.443,00:45:40.029,It's game time.
00:45:43.198,00:45:44.741,Y'all ready for this?
00:45:46.743,00:45:48.412,"Oh, no! They were ready for that."
00:45:48.495,00:45:51.373,-It didn't break! -Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!
00:45:53.042,00:45:54.751,-Fire! -No!
00:45:55.627,00:45:56.711,I can't move!
00:45:56.796,00:45:58.172,"Don't worry, Superman. I'll get you out of there."
00:45:58.255,00:45:59.423,No don't.
00:45:59.506,00:46:03.844,"Ah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck. My legs are stuck as well."
00:46:03.928,00:46:04.929,I super hate you.
00:46:05.012,00:46:08.015,Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
00:46:08.098,00:46:11.018,"-Babe, help me get him out of here. -I said every man for himself."
00:46:11.101,00:46:12.937,"Hey, you gotta be there for me."
00:46:17.232,00:46:19.526,Fine! Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.
00:46:19.609,00:46:22.404,-I need you to have a better attitude. -I have a great attitude.
00:46:22.487,00:46:23.655,Ow!
00:46:23.989,00:46:25.532,BAD COP: The Special's in the northwest quadrant.
00:46:25.615,00:46:26.909,We've got him cornered.
00:46:27.910,00:46:28.953,Ow. Ow. Ow.
00:46:29.036,00:46:30.120,Where'd he go?
00:46:35.000,00:46:38.003,"UNIKITTY: Oh, no! They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!"
00:46:38.087,00:46:39.796,Let's go! We need to get Emmet out of here.
00:46:39.880,00:46:43.175,-EMMET: Can't we build something? -Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.
00:46:43.258,00:46:44.718,I can build a spaceship. Watch this.
00:46:46.846,00:46:48.931,No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.
00:46:49.431,00:46:52.726,That's okay. I didn't really wanna build a spaceship anyway. That's cool.
00:46:52.809,00:46:54.478,Where can we go where we can't be found?
00:46:56.480,00:46:58.232,What if we went underwater?
00:46:58.315,00:46:59.399,"Great idea, babe!"
00:46:59.483,00:47:01.151,"Thank you, Batman. Your ideas are the best."
00:47:01.235,00:47:02.236,"But, hey, I just said that."
00:47:02.319,00:47:05.197,"-We could build a submarine. -A Bat-Submarine, patent pending."
00:47:05.280,00:47:06.365,With rainbows!
00:47:06.448,00:47:08.492,"And dream catchers, in case we take a nap."
00:47:08.575,00:47:09.910,Like an underwater spaceship!
00:47:09.994,00:47:11.871,But you can't build all of them at once.
00:47:11.954,00:47:14.039,-ALL: Ready? Break. -Okay.
00:47:14.123,00:47:17.251,UNIKITTY: These are the colors I need. Blue razzle berry and sour apple!
00:47:17.501,00:47:19.419,"If anybody has black parts, I need them, okay?"
00:47:19.503,00:47:20.921,I only work in black.
00:47:21.005,00:47:23.090,"And sometimes, very, very dark gray."
00:47:23.173,00:47:24.674,WYLDSTYLE: Use the yellow bricks! EMMET: Can I help?
00:47:24.758,00:47:26.760,UNIKITTY: No! It has to be this way! WYLDSTYLE: I need that!
00:47:26.843,00:47:27.928,Where is he?
00:47:28.012,00:47:30.097,"Anyone know what this is, and do you need it?"
00:47:30.180,00:47:32.224,I think we could use wings and rocket boosters.
00:47:32.307,00:47:33.850,Ew. Get your retro-space stuff out of my area.
00:47:33.934,00:47:37.437,"You guys, hey, just tell me exactly what to do. And how to do it."
00:47:37.521,00:47:40.482,"Emmet, don't worry about what the others are doing."
00:47:41.108,00:47:44.278,You must embrace what is special about you!
00:47:53.287,00:47:55.915,"There he is! All units, attack the sub!"
00:48:00.335,00:48:01.628,"WYLDSTYLE: Emmet, get in here!"
00:48:07.217,00:48:10.554,BAD COP: Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him get to the water!
00:48:11.013,00:48:12.431,"WYLDSTYLE: Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!"
00:48:12.514,00:48:13.557,We're going under!
00:48:31.158,00:48:32.284,"Oh, no."
00:48:55.975,00:48:57.434,It's gone.
00:49:01.105,00:49:06.068,I feel something inside. It's like the opposite of happiness.
00:49:06.610,00:49:09.529,I must stay positive.
00:49:12.407,00:49:13.700,Ah. Bubble gums.
00:49:15.660,00:49:16.870,Butterflies.
00:49:24.128,00:49:26.255,"Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty."
00:49:28.090,00:49:30.425,Do you want to sit down and talk about it?
00:49:31.135,00:49:34.638,What the heck is that?
00:49:34.929,00:49:36.848,It's a double-decker couch.
00:49:36.931,00:49:41.895,Which seemed like a good idea at the time but I now realize it's not super helpful.
00:49:42.646,00:49:45.024,"But, you know, it has cup holders."
00:49:45.107,00:49:47.442,Seats flip up with coolers underneath.
00:49:49.069,00:49:51.905,You are so disappointing on so many levels.
00:49:51.988,00:49:54.658,-Why are my pants cold and wet? -Ew.
00:49:54.866,00:49:56.201,VITRUVIUS: Uh.
00:49:57.536,00:49:59.579,-COMPUTER: Hull breach. -The walls are crying!
00:49:59.663,00:50:01.415,We're coming apart at the seams!
00:50:02.666,00:50:04.251,This is not how Batman dies.
00:50:05.669,00:50:06.753,Emmet!
00:50:06.836,00:50:08.672,"-Hold on, hold on! -Wyldstyle!"
00:50:10.757,00:50:12.426,"WYLDSTYLE: Deep breath! Deep breath, everybody..."
00:50:30.402,00:50:33.238,"Micro-managers, what's going on down there?"
00:50:34.281,00:50:36.366,MICRO-MANAGER: Scanning submarine wreckage.
00:50:37.409,00:50:39.328,No survivors detected.
00:50:39.744,00:50:42.747,"Scuba cops, dredge the entire ocean if you have to."
00:50:43.039,00:50:44.791,We have got to find that Piece.
00:50:44.874,00:50:48.795,Let's get these prisoners back to Lord Business and give him the good news.
00:50:48.878,00:50:51.381,The Special is no more.
00:50:56.010,00:50:57.304,"LORD BUSINESS: Hello, everybody!"
00:50:57.387,00:51:00.515,"Superman. Wonder Woman, I had no idea you'd be here."
00:51:00.599,00:51:02.101,Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
00:51:02.184,00:51:04.144,"Greetings, all!"
00:51:04.228,00:51:06.480,Welcome to my Think Tank.
00:51:07.021,00:51:08.982,MASTER BUILDERS: Help us!
00:51:09.065,00:51:12.152,All the Master Builders you've captured over the years you've brought them here.
00:51:12.236,00:51:15.239,"You're a very perceptive person, Superman."
00:51:15.322,00:51:18.450,They come up with all the instructions for everything in the universe.
00:51:18.533,00:51:19.659,Robots!
00:51:26.708,00:51:28.377,Can't get much worse than this.
00:51:28.460,00:51:30.670,"-GREEN LANTERN: Uh, hello, neighbor. -Oh, no."
00:51:30.754,00:51:31.796,It's Green Lantern.
00:51:31.880,00:51:35.175,"Oh, my gosh, we're roommates! How crazy is that?"
00:51:35.259,00:51:37.761,Does anyone have some Kryptonite that they could give me?
00:51:38.595,00:51:41.431,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is the Special?"
00:51:41.681,00:51:44.684,The Special and the Piece of Resistance are at the bottom of the ocean.
00:51:44.768,00:51:46.811,"Wait, are you telling me you don't have him?"
00:51:46.895,00:51:50.524,"Sir, my scuba team is looking for his remains as we speak."
00:51:50.607,00:51:54.736,"Bad Cop, he could still be alive. The Piece could still be out there."
00:51:54.819,00:51:58.365,The only remnant of the Special was a double-decker couch.
00:51:58.865,00:52:00.367,"Wait, hold on."
00:52:00.450,00:52:02.744,"-A double-decker couch? -Yes, sir."
00:52:02.827,00:52:07.207,Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch? Is that what it's like?
00:52:07.291,00:52:08.875,That's weird.
00:52:08.958,00:52:12.171,If you're sitting in the top middle how are you gonna get down without climbing over someone?
00:52:12.962,00:52:18.218,LORD BUSINESS: If you're sitting on the bottom and you're watching TV are you gonna have to watch through a bunch of dangling legs?
00:52:18.302,00:52:20.345,Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?
00:52:20.429,00:52:25.392,It is literally the most useless idea I have ever heard.
00:52:29.145,00:52:31.231,"-Well, we're still alive. -Yeah!"
00:52:31.523,00:52:33.900,Ha. The double-decker couch.
00:52:33.983,00:52:35.485,It wasn't totally pointless after all.
00:52:35.569,00:52:37.696,It's the one thing that stayed together.
00:52:37.779,00:52:39.698,"I always believed in you, Emmet."
00:52:39.823,00:52:45.119,"I don't mean to spoil the party, but does anyone else notice we're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch?"
00:52:45.204,00:52:50.166,"I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship is gonna come out of nowhere and save us... My gosh!"
00:52:54.629,00:52:56.923,"Avast, mateys!"
00:53:03.680,00:53:06.225,"Metal Beard, I thought you said we were a lost cause!"
00:53:06.308,00:53:07.726,Ye are!
00:53:07.809,00:53:13.189,Did ye not hear me whole story circumscribing the folly of this whole enterprise?
00:53:13.482,00:53:15.734,"Well, it's kind of hard not to hear when you're yelling everything."
00:53:15.817,00:53:17.444,So why did you come back?
00:53:17.527,00:53:19.946,This be-doubled land couch.
00:53:21.323,00:53:24.951,I watched Lord Business' forces completely overlook it.
00:53:25.369,00:53:27.454,Which means we need more ideas like it!
00:53:27.537,00:53:34.503,"-Oh, thank you. -Ideas so dumb and bad that no one would ever think they could possibly be useful."
00:53:34.586,00:53:36.212,Oh. Thank you.
00:53:36.796,00:53:39.173,"VITRUVIUS: So, Special, what do we do?"
00:53:42.552,00:53:44.012,Uh.
00:53:45.472,00:53:46.681,Well.
00:53:47.140,00:53:50.894,What's the last thing Lord Business expects Master Builders will do?
00:53:50.977,00:53:52.479,-Build a spaceship? -Kill a chicken?
00:53:52.562,00:53:54.773,"-Marry a marshmallow. -Why, this."
00:53:58.277,00:54:01.321,No! It's follow the instructions.
00:54:02.906,00:54:03.990,-Don't like that. -Sounds weird.
00:54:04.073,00:54:05.992,"No. Now, listen. Wait, listen."
00:54:08.537,00:54:11.706,"Guys, you're all so talented and imaginative."
00:54:12.749,00:54:15.502,But you can't work together as a team.
00:54:16.920,00:54:19.130,I'm just a construction worker.
00:54:19.213,00:54:24.761,"But when I had a plan and we were all working together I mean, we could build a skyscraper."
00:54:27.096,00:54:29.433,"Now, you're Master Builders."
00:54:29.808,00:54:33.437,Just imagine what could happen if you did that.
00:54:35.271,00:54:37.065,You could save the universe.
00:54:37.857,00:54:40.402,"Well said, Emmet. Well said."
00:54:40.985,00:54:44.113,"-Really? -She be a fine speech there, laddie."
00:54:44.948,00:54:45.949,Okay.
00:54:47.742,00:54:58.545,"Somebody get me some markers, some construction paper and some glitter glue!"
00:55:01.297,00:55:07.971,"I call this, Emmet's plan to get inside the Tower put the Piece of Resistance on the Kragle and save the world."
00:55:08.054,00:55:10.390,I've built a hundred just like them back in the city.
00:55:10.474,00:55:13.560,"If we can just get in, I know where all the air ducts and wiring are located."
00:55:13.643,00:55:14.811,I can get us anywhere.
00:55:14.894,00:55:16.187,How will we get inside?
00:55:16.896,00:55:17.897,In a spaceship.
00:55:20.775,00:55:26.406,"No, they're expecting us to show up in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship."
00:55:26.490,00:55:27.907,One of those sounds awesome to me.
00:55:27.991,00:55:33.121,My idea is to build a spaceship that's exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships.
00:55:33.497,00:55:36.458,So not the special spaceship that I'm building for all of you right now?
00:55:36.541,00:55:38.167,"Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time."
00:55:38.502,00:55:41.254,"Oh, you're really letting the oxygen out of my tank here."
00:55:42.589,00:55:46.259,"Yeah, but according to your precious instructions this ship needs a hyperdrive."
00:55:46.342,00:55:48.470,-We don't have that part. -Maybe we could find one!
00:55:48.553,00:55:51.264,"What do you think, a spaceship is just gonna appear out of the blue?"
00:55:51.347,00:55:53.266,Are you kidding me? The same bit!
00:55:58.522,00:55:59.648,-Chewie! -Mmm!
00:55:59.731,00:56:02.275,"We're supposed to be halfway to Naboo for a sweet party, right now."
00:56:02.358,00:56:06.029,This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning taking us to loser systems like this.
00:56:06.362,00:56:08.072,"Captain Solo, we must go."
00:56:08.156,00:56:10.241,You know how perturbed I get if we are not punctual.
00:56:10.324,00:56:11.743,The Droid's right. Let's roll.
00:56:11.826,00:56:13.495,"Now hold on, Han."
00:56:13.578,00:56:16.122,This might be the right galaxy after all.
00:56:16.205,00:56:18.792,Because I see a heavenly body.
00:56:18.875,00:56:22.587,"Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend. And it is super serious. Right, babe?"
00:56:22.671,00:56:24.088,-Of course it's serious. -Yeah!
00:56:24.172,00:56:26.132,-Got room for just one dude? -Whoa! Babe!
00:56:26.215,00:56:28.427,If he's a cool dude like you.
00:56:28.510,00:56:30.804,-You're trying to bail on us! -I'm not trying to bail!
00:56:30.887,00:56:32.806,You asked them if you could go with them on their party ship.
00:56:32.889,00:56:35.308,-That thing is filled with bon vivants. -You speak French now?
00:56:35.391,00:56:42.315,"Babe, look, if this relationship is ever gonna work between us I need to feel free to party with a bunch of strangers whenever I feel like it."
00:56:42.398,00:56:43.900,What? Babe.
00:56:45.527,00:56:47.070,I will text you.
00:56:47.153,00:56:50.532,"LANDO: Where'd you get that sweet space cape, brother?"
00:56:51.866,00:56:53.577,It's party time!
00:56:54.869,00:56:55.912,Babe?
00:57:05.088,00:57:08.424,"Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person."
00:57:08.508,00:57:12.261,"And, you know, if Batman can't see that, then he's just..."
00:57:12.762,00:57:19.644,"Well, he's just as blind as a guy whose eyes stopped working."
00:57:21.145,00:57:25.358,"And I'm gonna tell you something, Batman is the worst person I've ever met."
00:57:25.442,00:57:27.360,-Need a hyperdrive? -No way.
00:57:27.444,00:57:29.237,-Babe! -I knew it! I knew that.
00:57:29.320,00:57:30.864,You really had me there!
00:57:30.947,00:57:33.783,Those guys were so lame. All they did was play space checkers.
00:57:33.867,00:57:35.785,"Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude."
00:57:35.869,00:57:37.704,"And the metal one, too. All dudes."
00:57:37.787,00:57:39.581,But won't they notice their hyperdrive is missing?
00:57:39.664,00:57:42.751,"LANDO: Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive."
00:57:45.795,00:57:47.130,"Nah, they'll be fine."
00:57:50.299,00:57:51.551,Step one.
00:57:51.635,00:57:54.971,"All right, we need a red four-piece unit over at the..."
00:57:55.346,00:57:58.808,"Unikitty, you're supposed to follow the instructions, remember?"
00:57:58.892,00:57:59.934,Sorry.
00:58:00.268,00:58:01.686,"Ugh, this gives me the jeebies."
00:58:01.770,00:58:03.146,"What do I even... I, I can't."
00:58:06.483,00:58:07.651,Nice!
00:58:07.942,00:58:08.985,EMMET: Step two.
00:58:09.193,00:58:15.742,"We pilot the ship to the service entrance so we can get past the dangerous, but also kind of cool, laser gate."
00:58:16.785,00:58:18.620,-Space ID. -I have a drive-on.
00:58:18.703,00:58:20.079,Who are you here to see?
00:58:20.329,00:58:21.748,I'm here to see Your Butt.
00:58:21.831,00:58:24.626,"Is that last name Butt, first name Your, or is it..."
00:58:28.421,00:58:31.382,BATMAN: Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.
00:58:35.303,00:58:36.345,First try!
00:58:37.681,00:58:43.311,EMMET: Step three. We break into Lord Business' office and we'll plunder his collection of relics for disguises.
00:58:44.437,00:58:48.274,Step four. Benny and Metal Beard will sneak their way into the master control room.
00:58:48.357,00:58:50.401,COMPUTER: Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.
00:58:50.819,00:58:52.028,ROBOT: 10-4.
00:58:52.111,00:58:53.112,Uh-oh.
00:58:57.200,00:58:59.410,-Are you thinking what I'm thinking? -Oh!
00:58:59.493,00:59:00.787,Do it.
00:59:05.208,00:59:06.417,"Metal Beard, that was awesome!"
00:59:06.500,00:59:08.211,First law of the sea.
00:59:08.795,00:59:11.798,Never place your rear end on a pirate's face.
00:59:12.215,00:59:15.844,"EMMET: Once inside, they'll use their technical know-how to disable the Kragle shield."
00:59:15.927,00:59:17.220,I am the computer.
00:59:17.303,00:59:19.639,Cool! Talking computer.
00:59:19.723,00:59:22.892,Please disable the shield systems.
00:59:22.976,00:59:24.102,Of course.
00:59:24.769,00:59:27.063,There are no movies in your area with that title.
00:59:28.272,00:59:31.735,EMMET: Step five. Vitruvius will provide lookout and make sure we're not being followed.
00:59:31.818,00:59:33.236,VITRUVIUS: Okay.
00:59:33.319,00:59:38.617,EMMET: Step six. Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom to make one last change to Lord Business' plan.
00:59:38.700,00:59:41.620,I move that we freeze the universe. Can I get a second on that?
00:59:41.703,00:59:42.829,BRUCE: I second.
00:59:42.912,00:59:45.123,"Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises."
00:59:45.206,00:59:48.084,"Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?"
00:59:48.167,00:59:50.253,Sounds like a cool guy.
00:59:52.296,00:59:53.757,We'd like to invest in your company.
00:59:53.840,00:59:57.010,"Your weapon to control the universe sounds super sweet, I must say."
00:59:57.093,00:59:58.845,"It is, indeed, super sweet."
00:59:58.928,01:00:01.640,Cool. What kind of sound system does it have?
01:00:01.723,01:00:04.851,"Uh, sound system? Well, I mean, we have an iPod shuffle."
01:00:04.934,01:00:06.144,Wait a second.
01:00:06.227,01:00:10.148,You're telling me you have a machine to control the universe and you can't listen to tunes in surround sound?

01:07:56.029,01:07:58.616,No one ever told me I was special.
01:07:58.699,01:08:01.744,I never got a trophy just for showing up!

01:11:18.607,01:11:24.822,The reason I made up the prophecy was because I knew that whoever found the Piece could become the Special.
01:11:24.905,01:11:30.619,Because the only thing anyone needs to be special is to believe that you can be.
01:11:30.828,01:11:34.164,"I know that sounds like a cat poster, but it's true."
01:11:35.291,01:11:38.544,Look at what you did when you believed you were special.
01:11:39.002,01:11:41.422,You just need to believe it some more.
01:11:41.672,01:11:45.968,"But how can I just decide to believe that I'm special, when I'm not?"

01:13:33.075,01:13:34.618,Does anyone have any ideas?
01:13:35.661,01:13:37.079,Emmet had ideas.
01:13:37.455,01:13:41.249,"Yargh, if only there were more people in the world like he."
01:13:45.879,01:13:47.214,Maybe there are.
01:13:47.756,01:13:49.257,Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.
01:13:51.469,01:13:54.930,"Honey, where are my pant..."
01:13:55.931,01:13:56.974,"-Hi! -WYLDSTYLE: Hey, guess what."
01:13:57.057,01:13:59.477,Found your pants. Series is over. Benny.
01:13:59.560,01:14:01.937,Send this out to everyone in the universe.
01:14:02.020,01:14:04.022,1980-something technology?
01:14:04.440,01:14:05.608,Now you're talking!
01:14:11.780,01:14:15.408,"You don't know me, but I'm on TV, so you can trust me."
01:14:18.704,01:14:20.873,But there is a way out of this.
01:14:21.790,01:14:23.291,This is Emmet.
01:14:23.876,01:14:25.503,And he was just like all of you.
01:14:25.961,01:14:29.632,A face in the crowd following the same instructions as you.
01:14:30.549,01:14:33.051,"He was so good at fitting in, no one ever saw him."
01:14:33.969,01:14:37.973,And I owe you an apology because I used to look down on people like that.
01:14:38.390,01:14:43.771,I used to think they were followers with no ideas or vision.
01:14:44.229,01:14:46.690,"WYLDSTYLE: Because it turns out, Emmet had great ideas."
01:14:46.774,01:14:55.323,"And even though they seemed weird and kind of pointless, they actually came closer than anyone else to saving the universe."
01:14:55.908,01:15:02.080,And now we have to finish what he started by making whatever weird thing pops into our heads.
01:15:02.164,01:15:05.292,All of you have the ability inside of you to be a groundbreaker.
01:15:05.375,01:15:07.085,And I mean literally!
01:15:07.169,01:15:09.087,Break the ground!
01:15:09.171,01:15:11.423,"Peel up the pieces, tear apart your walls!"
01:15:11.507,01:15:13.425,Build things only you could build.
01:15:13.509,01:15:14.927,Defend yourselves.
01:15:15.010,01:15:19.222,We need to fight back against President Business' plans to freeze us!
01:15:20.432,01:15:23.143,Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.
01:15:23.519,01:15:26.772,It will be known as Freedom Friday!
01:15:28.524,01:15:30.943,But still on a Tuesday!
01:15:37.365,01:15:39.034,End of the line.
01:15:41.870,01:15:42.871,Bad Cop?
01:15:42.955,01:15:45.165,I hope there's still a Good Cop in me somewhere.
01:15:47.292,01:15:50.963,I'll hold these guys off. You go stop them. Yay!
01:15:51.046,01:15:53.632,"Great idea, but how will we get there?"
01:15:53.882,01:15:55.718,MISSION CONTROL: T-minus one.
01:15:55.801,01:16:00.347,"Ten, nine, eight, -seven, six, -I could, uh..."

01:16:04.476,01:16:05.728,I could build a spaceship!
01:16:09.732,01:16:11.734,"Build away, whatever your name is."
01:16:16.279,01:16:18.156,BENNY: Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!
01:16:21.243,01:16:22.327,Spaceship!

01:16:31.044,01:16:32.295,"All units, attack that spaceship."
01:16:34.256,01:16:35.340,Spaceship!
01:16:36.634,01:16:38.218,-Where'd he go? -BENNY: Spaceship!
01:16:41.263,01:16:44.141,"UNIKITTY: Wyldstyle, look, it's the citizens."
01:16:50.272,01:16:51.649,KNIGHT: Tally-ho!

01:16:53.817,01:16:56.194,And don't forget us Master Builders.
01:16:56.569,01:16:58.155,LORD BUSINESS: What is going on?
01:16:58.656,01:17:01.158,You stop building that stuff!
01:17:01.366,01:17:02.450,Just stop it!
01:17:07.039,01:17:08.874,-MAN: Great job! -This might actually work.
01:17:08.957,01:17:11.960,'Twas your speech which roused this hearty crew.
01:17:13.253,01:17:15.213,If only Emmet were here to see this.
01:17:15.297,01:17:17.382,"He'd say something adorable, like..."
01:17:21.929,01:17:28.185,EMMET: Am I just gonna keep falling forever?
01:17:40.698,01:17:42.199,EMMET: Is this another vision?
01:17:45.160,01:17:46.203,Where am I?
01:17:47.245,01:17:49.998,Is that the Office Tower?
01:17:56.504,01:17:57.589,Bricksburg!
01:17:59.507,01:18:00.592,EMMET: What was that?
01:18:02.678,01:18:03.679,"No, no, no."
01:18:04.262,01:18:05.347,No!
01:18:07.307,01:18:08.600,"FINN: Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!"
01:18:09.101,01:18:11.186,-Pew! -EMMET: What in the world is that?
01:18:13.521,01:18:15.315,EMMET: It's adorable.
01:18:18.526,01:18:19.569,Uh-oh.
01:18:19.987,01:18:21.989,"No. No. Whoa, no, no, no."
01:18:22.322,01:18:24.867,"Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me. Do not eat me. Please."
01:18:25.617,01:18:26.618,"Hi, Emmet."
01:18:27.828,01:18:28.871,EMMET: Uh...
01:18:29.371,01:18:30.497,Hi?
01:18:34.001,01:18:36.003,Is this the Man?
01:18:43.468,01:18:45.345,EMMET: The Man Upstairs?
01:18:50.308,01:18:51.351,Ooh...
01:18:52.895,01:18:54.021,What happened?
01:18:55.313,01:18:57.399,"No, no, no, this is a disaster."
01:18:58.566,01:19:00.944,Why? Why? What? What?
01:19:01.444,01:19:02.780,What?
01:19:07.034,01:19:08.493,But I was just playing and...
01:19:08.576,01:19:12.455,"Look, I know it's hard to understand, but this is Dad's stuff, okay?"
01:19:12.539,01:19:16.668,All of this that you see before you is all your father's.
01:19:16.752,01:19:18.711,And everything is thought-out very...
01:19:19.797,01:19:22.049,What did you do down here? Did you take the top off of the tower?
01:19:22.758,01:19:23.926,It was an accident.
01:19:24.467,01:19:31.266,"You accidentally, expertly, carefully took the entire top off of that tower?"
01:19:32.392,01:19:34.561,-Yes. -You know the rules. This isn't a toy.
01:19:34.644,01:19:37.564,"-Um, well, it kind of is. -No."
01:19:37.647,01:19:41.359,"Actually, it's a highly sophisticated interlocking brick system."
01:19:41.777,01:19:43.904,-But we bought it at the toy store. -We did.
01:19:43.987,01:19:47.157,But the way I'm using it makes it an adult thing.
01:19:47.240,01:19:49.742,The box for this one said ages eight to 14.
01:19:49.827,01:19:53.663,That's a suggestion. They have to put that on there.
01:19:53.746,01:19:56.541,FINN: You can't expect me to be able to resist playing with all this.
01:19:56.624,01:19:59.544,"Look, you have your stuff over near the Christmas decorations."
01:20:00.295,01:20:02.255,"All those bricks, you can build anything you want."
01:20:06.051,01:20:12.265,"Finn, we're gonna play a little game. It's called, Let's Put Everything Back the Way You Found It."
01:20:12.349,01:20:14.351,"But, Dad, you don't understand."
01:20:14.434,01:20:17.479,So I can make things the way they're supposed to be.
01:20:20.773,01:20:22.150,Permanently.
01:20:25.278,01:20:26.404,EMMET: More Kragles?
01:20:26.779,01:20:29.157,This rebellion ends right now.

01:21:16.163,01:21:18.874,"-It's a battleship. -No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is."
01:21:19.166,01:21:20.918,What's Batman doing on it?
01:21:21.001,01:21:22.544,"What is this, a robot pirate?"
01:21:25.838,01:21:27.465,EMMET: Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!
01:21:27.549,01:21:29.342,You got glue all over that construction worker.
01:21:31.011,01:21:33.013,Here. Give that to me.
01:21:33.430,01:21:35.640,EMMET: Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
01:21:35.723,01:21:37.725,"All of those are my friends! No, stop it!"
01:21:37.809,01:21:40.896,METAL BEARD: Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...
01:21:41.729,01:21:43.065,It be over.
01:21:43.731,01:21:45.192,EMMET: No!
01:21:49.988,01:21:51.281,I can still save them!
01:21:51.739,01:21:54.952,Let's get this gunk off this construction worker.
01:21:55.035,01:21:57.579,"He's not just a construction worker, Dad. He's the hero."
01:21:58.080,01:21:59.831,"MAN UPSTAIRS: Nope, he's not."
01:21:59.915,01:22:07.297,"He is an ordinary, regular, generic construction worker and I need to put him back where he belongs."
01:22:08.590,01:22:11.218,"Now, where is my X-Acto knife?"
01:22:14.262,01:22:16.681,EMMET: I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.
01:22:17.599,01:22:20.685,If I could get the attention of the smaller creature.
01:22:21.561,01:22:22.604,I gotta move.
01:22:22.895,01:22:24.814,Where is that?
01:22:25.273,01:22:27.192,EMMET: Move!
01:22:35.408,01:22:36.784,All right.
01:23:04.812,01:23:06.148,"Now, I didn't move..."
01:23:10.152,01:23:11.236,EMMET: Ow.

01:23:15.198,01:23:18.326,FINN: I think I saw the X-Acto over there near Middle Zealand.

01:23:19.995,01:23:21.329,Welcome.

01:23:40.473,01:23:41.808,VITRUVIUS: Believe.
01:23:43.060,01:23:47.314,I know that sounds like a cat poster but it's true.
01:23:54.446,01:23:55.780,Whoa!
01:24:09.461,01:24:10.462,"Sorry, street."

01:24:59.802,01:25:01.513,"We'll help you out, kid."
01:25:01.763,01:25:04.266,Here's how we do it pirate-style!
01:25:06.976,01:25:08.228,WYLDSTYLE: Yes! Emmet! That's it!

01:25:15.860,01:25:16.861,Emmet!
01:25:19.656,01:25:21.032,Stay positive.
01:25:22.200,01:25:23.368,They're tearing me apart!
01:25:24.536,01:25:26.246,Stay positive.
01:25:26.413,01:25:27.455,Come on!
01:25:27.539,01:25:28.956,"Oh, forget it!"
01:25:34.421,01:25:37.089,You all need to be more friendly!
01:25:39.634,01:25:40.968,"Emmet, go!"
01:25:41.052,01:25:42.762,Go! Now's your chance.
01:25:42.845,01:25:43.930,METAL BEARD: She's right!

01:25:58.820,01:26:00.363,"Back from the dead, Brickowski?"
01:26:00.655,01:26:01.948,"Well, you're too late!"
01:26:02.031,01:26:03.366,"Skeletrons, get him!"
01:26:18.465,01:26:20.217,"oh, they're finished!"
01:26:20.633,01:26:22.510,My world is almost finished.
01:26:23.470,01:26:26.764,The last thing I need to do is finish you.
01:26:26.848,01:26:27.932,"No, stop! Please!"
01:26:28.015,01:26:30.560,"If you do one more thing, I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon."
01:26:31.186,01:26:32.520,Your secret weapon?
01:26:33.271,01:26:37.859,"Yes, it's called, the Power of the Special."
01:26:38.150,01:26:39.277,That sounds dumb.
01:26:40.195,01:26:46.117,"All right, here it comes. My secret weapon is this."
01:26:47.159,01:26:49.662,What is that? Is it super small? I don't see anything.
01:26:49.746,01:26:52.081,It's my hand. I want you to take it.
01:26:52.164,01:26:53.666,You want me to take your hand off?
01:26:53.750,01:26:56.419,"No, I want you to join me."
01:26:57.169,01:27:00.382,Look at all of these things that people built.
01:27:00.465,01:27:01.758,You might see a mess.
01:27:02.174,01:27:07.096,"Exactly. And a bunch of weird, dorky stuff that ruined my perfectly good stuff!"
01:27:08.223,01:27:16.314,Okay. What I see are people inspired by each other and by you.
01:27:16.898,01:27:22.237,People taking what you made and making something new out of it.
01:27:38.586,01:27:40.255,"Finn, did you make all of this?"
01:27:43.215,01:27:47.762,The people are trying to stop President Business from using the Kragle.
01:27:48.763,01:27:49.931,What's the Kragle?
01:27:50.765,01:27:52.934,"Um, it's in there."
01:27:55.728,01:27:57.063,In here?
