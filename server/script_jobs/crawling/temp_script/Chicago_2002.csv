00:00:56.223,00:00:57.933,Anybody seen the Kelly Sisters?
00:01:01.645,00:01:03.230,You. You're up in five.
00:01:31.967,00:01:33.468,"Velma, where you been?"
00:02:13.717,00:02:15.344,"You're killing me, here!"
00:02:17.262,00:02:24.227,"Ladies and gentlemen, the Onyx Club is proud to present Chicago's hottest dancing duo."
00:02:24.978,00:02:27.648,Two jazz babes moving as one.
00:02:28.774,00:02:30.525,The Kelly Sisters.
00:04:28.643,00:04:30.562,But I didn't even meet your friend.
00:04:30.645,00:04:32.856,"-That manager guy. -Don't worry, Roxie."
00:04:36.234,00:04:38.945,"Yeah, kid, it's all arranged."
00:05:44.177,00:05:46.096,"Hello, Miss Borusewicz."
00:05:46.179,00:05:47.722,Mrs. Hart.
00:05:47.806,00:05:49.266,This is Fred.
00:05:50.809,00:05:52.269,He's my brother.
00:06:35.312,00:06:36.688,"You're a star, kid."
00:06:36.771,00:06:38.565,My little shootin' star.
00:07:12.891,00:07:14.392,"Where's the fire, huh?"
00:07:14.893,00:07:17.270,Amos ain't home till midnight.
00:07:19.105,00:07:23.735,Freddy… Fred?
00:07:29.991,00:07:37.707,"Hey, you know, I don't want you to feel like I'm nagging at you or anything, but don't you think it's about time I met your friend down at the Onyx?"
00:07:39.125,00:07:42.045,"I mean, it's been a month since you told him about me."
00:07:44.214,00:07:49.427,And I know 'cause that was the night Velma Kelly plugged her husband and her sister.
00:07:51.429,00:07:54.349,You know they say that she found 'em in the kip together?
00:07:55.016,00:08:03.650,"Gosh, if I ever found Amos slipping it to somebody else, boy, I'd throw him a party, -a great big going-away party. -It's getting late."
00:08:04.776,00:08:06.653,"I have been thinking a lot about my act, though."
00:08:06.736,00:08:10.615,Whenever I get a really good idea I write it down in my diary before it goes out of my head.
00:08:10.699,00:08:13.034,And you know what occurred to me the other day?
00:08:13.118,00:08:19.207,"That all the really, really knockout acts have something a little different going on, you know?"
00:08:19.958,00:08:23.253,Like a signature bit.
00:08:23.336,00:08:29.217,"And I thought that my thing could be aloof, you know?"
00:08:29.843,00:08:35.015,"Give 'em just enough to get 'em good and hungry, but always leave 'em wantin' more."
00:08:36.725,00:08:42.188,"Hey, and once I get a name for myself, maybe… maybe we could open up a club of our own, you know?"
00:08:42.272,00:08:45.400,"You could run it, and I could be the headliner."
00:08:46.484,00:08:48.737,"-What's the idea? -Wake up, kiddo."
00:08:48.820,00:08:50.572,You ain't never gonna have an act.
00:08:51.448,00:08:52.782,Says who?
00:08:52.866,00:08:55.910,"Face it, Roxie. You're a two-bit talent with skinny legs."
00:08:55.994,00:08:57.662,And I'm just a furniture salesman.
00:08:57.871,00:08:59.456,"Yeah, but you got connections."
00:08:59.539,00:09:02.083,"-You know, that guy at the club. -There is no guy."
00:09:02.167,00:09:05.587,"-Yeah, but that night-- -It was the first time I set foot in that joint."
00:09:05.670,00:09:08.173,I was collecting on a bet from the trombone player.
00:09:08.923,00:09:11.134,"So, you never told anyone about me?"
00:09:11.801,00:09:14.012,"Sugar, you were hot stuff."
00:09:14.095,00:09:16.322,I would have said anything to get a piece of that.
00:09:18.099,00:09:20.060,And now? Now?
00:09:20.143,00:09:22.562,We had some laughs. Let's just leave it at that.
00:09:23.354,00:09:28.526,Fred… You can't do this to me.
00:09:35.366,00:09:37.577,"You touch me again, I'll put your lights out!"
00:09:42.499,00:09:44.542,Why don't you wash yourself before you go hitting those sheets again?
00:09:47.837,00:09:49.672,You lied to me.
00:09:51.216,00:09:54.719,"-You lied to me, you son of a bitch! -That's life, sweetheart. That's life."
00:10:06.022,00:10:08.441,You're a son of a bitch!
00:10:24.040,00:10:25.667,I hear it's a new city record.
00:10:25.750,00:10:27.710,From killin' to confession in an hour flat.
00:10:32.465,00:10:34.175,"Just in case of trouble, you know?"
00:10:34.884,00:10:37.470,"That's just fine. Sign right there, Mr. Hart."
00:10:37.554,00:10:40.098,Freely and gladly. Freely and gladly.
00:10:40.181,00:10:42.600,And mind you don't say we beat it out of you when you get on the witness stand.
00:10:42.684,00:10:45.937,"No, I gave myself up. Surrendered of my own free will."
00:10:46.020,00:10:47.313,Isn't he the cheerful murderer?
00:10:49.399,00:10:51.401,"Just last week, a jury thanked a man."
00:10:51.484,00:10:53.695,I'm always grateful for citizens who know the law.
00:10:53.778,00:10:55.029,Get in there.
00:10:55.905,00:10:57.073,You too.
00:10:59.701,00:11:00.910,Sit down.
00:11:03.371,00:11:05.456,Okay. From the top.
00:11:06.791,00:11:09.836,"A man's got a right to protect his home and loved ones, right?"
00:11:11.087,00:11:18.636,"Well, I come home from the garage, and I see him climbing through the window with my wife, Roxie, laying there, sleeping like an angel."
00:11:20.513,00:11:23.099,it's the God's honest truth. My wife had nothing to do with it.
00:11:23.183,00:11:25.643,"She wouldn't hurt a worm, not even a worm."
00:11:25.727,00:11:28.586,It wasn't till I fired the first shot she even opened her eyes.
00:11:29.542,00:11:33.255,"Boy, she's some heavy sleeper. I always said she could sleep through the St. Paddy's Day Parade."
00:11:33.902,00:11:40.962,When I think of what would've happened if I went out for a beer with the guys instead of coming straight home? It makes you sick even thinking about it.
00:11:44.412,00:11:50.293,"would like to sing a song of love and devotion dedicated to her dear husband, Amos."
00:12:34.379,00:12:39.217,"Like I said, even after I shot him, he kept coming at me, so I had to pull the trigger again."
00:13:45.533,00:13:48.953,"Supposing, just supposing, he had violated her or something."
00:13:51.706,00:13:54.167,Or something. Think how terrible that would've been.
00:13:54.250,00:13:56.210,It's a good thing I got home from work on time.
00:13:58.629,00:13:59.881,"I say, I'm telling you that."
00:14:02.467,00:14:04.385,The name of deceased is Fred Casely.
00:14:04.469,00:14:07.347,Fred Casely? How could he be a burglar?
00:14:07.430,00:14:09.323,My wife knows him. He sold us our furniture.
00:14:10.683,00:14:12.474,He gave us 10% off.
00:14:16.564,00:14:18.107,You told me he was a burglar.
00:14:19.859,00:14:27.200,"She had him covered in a sheet, and she's telling me some cock-and-bull story about this burglar and how I ought to say I did it 'cause I was sure to get off."
00:14:27.283,00:14:29.827,"Help me, Amos, she says. It's my goddamn hour of need."
00:14:51.516,00:14:53.810,and tramping around like some goddamn floozy!
00:14:53.893,00:14:55.436,"Thought she could pull the wool over my eyes, huh?"
00:15:03.528,00:15:05.488,"Boy, what a sap I was!"
00:15:06.614,00:15:09.784,You double-crosser! You big blabbermouth!
00:15:09.867,00:15:13.121,"-You promised you'd stick. -You been stringin' me, Roxanne!"
00:15:13.204,00:15:14.831,-Stop-- -You told me he was a burglar!
00:15:14.914,00:15:16.833,"The whole time, you been up here jazzin' him."
00:15:16.916,00:15:19.460,You are a disloyal husband!
00:15:23.005,00:15:25.049,"Look, it's true. I shot him."
00:15:25.133,00:15:27.969,But it was self-defense. He was trying to burgle me.
00:15:28.052,00:15:31.806,"From what I hear, he's been burgling you three times a week for the last month."
00:15:32.432,00:15:33.975,"So, what do you say, missus?"
00:15:37.353,00:15:40.773,"Your story doesn't wash, Mrs. Hart, so try this on for size."
00:15:41.691,00:15:44.735,Fred Casely was a good time on the side with Goofy here as a meal ticket.
00:15:44.819,00:15:45.987,Meal ticket?
00:15:46.070,00:15:48.656,-He couldn't buy my liquor. -And Fred Casely could?
00:15:48.739,00:15:50.783,With a wife and five little Caselys?
00:15:50.867,00:15:52.743,Or did he forget to mention them?
00:15:55.079,00:15:56.664,What?
00:15:56.747,00:15:57.999,All his.
00:15:59.208,00:16:01.169,That bastard.
00:16:01.252,00:16:03.588,That bastard!
00:16:03.671,00:16:06.007,"Yeah, I killed him. I would kill him again."
00:16:06.090,00:16:09.218,"Once was enough, dearie. Take her downtown. Come on!"
00:16:13.973,00:16:15.433,"Here they come. This way, honey."
00:16:15.683,00:16:18.186,"Come on, it's a shame to hide such a beautiful face."
00:16:18.269,00:16:19.479,Why'd you shoot him?
00:16:19.562,00:16:22.773,Give us a profile with a smile like the girl from the toothpaste ad.
00:16:22.857,00:16:24.817,Enjoy it while you can. Take this down.
00:16:25.359,00:16:28.112,Assistant District Attorney Harrison says this is a hanging case.
00:16:28.196,00:16:31.115,"-Hanging? What do you mean, hanging? -I'm ready to go to the jury tomorrow."
00:16:31.199,00:16:34.202,"Not so tough anymore, are you? Take her down to the Cook County Jail."
00:16:34.285,00:16:37.830,We need a headline. Why'd you shoot him? Was he cruel? Did he beat you?
00:16:37.914,00:16:41.125,"Hey, what do you mean, hanging?"
00:16:59.519,00:17:01.270,"Morphine, opium, cocaine?"
00:17:01.938,00:17:06.567,"-Arm length, 31 inches. -Arm length, 31 inches."
00:17:06.651,00:17:08.778,"Height, 66 inches."
00:17:10.821,00:17:13.908,"The Matron's on her way, so don't get too cozy."
00:17:15.535,00:17:17.161,Put out that cigarette!
00:17:27.964,00:17:31.509,She's fine. Long as you keep her happy.
00:17:34.720,00:17:44.712,"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the keeper of the keys, the countess of the clink, the mistress of murderess row… Matron Mama Morton!"
00:18:25.938,00:18:27.231,"Welcome, ladies."
00:18:38.409,00:18:42.413,"You might think I'm here to make your life a living hell, but it's just not true."
00:18:53.924,00:18:55.926,"I'd like to be your friend, if you let me."
00:18:56.010,00:19:03.645,"So if there's something that upsets you or makes you unhappy in any way, don't shoot your fat-ass mouth off to me 'cause I don't give a shit. Now, move it out."
00:19:32.463,00:19:33.673,Let's go.
00:19:34.548,00:19:35.883,You must be Hart.
00:19:36.676,00:19:38.135,Ain't you the pretty one.
00:19:38.886,00:19:41.389,"-Thank you, ma'am. -Oh, no, call me Mama."
00:19:42.181,00:19:43.891,I'm here to take care of you.
00:19:44.684,00:19:47.144,Now you'll be habitatin' down in the east block.
00:19:47.228,00:19:48.813,"Murderess Row, we call it."
00:19:49.021,00:19:50.022,Oh!
00:19:50.272,00:19:51.371,Is that nicer?
00:20:01.409,00:20:05.204,I don't think I really belong in here. I didn't actually do anything wrong.
00:20:05.287,00:20:10.209,No need to tell me. I never heard of a man getting killed when he didn't get just what was coming to him.
00:20:10.292,00:20:13.129,"Hey, Mama! Come here. Come here."
00:20:13.713,00:20:15.089,Velma Kelly.
00:20:15.923,00:20:17.800,You're the Velma Kelly.
00:20:19.176,00:20:22.527,You know I was there that night? I was there the night you got arrested.
00:20:22.627,00:20:24.014,Yeah. You and half of Chicago.
00:20:24.515,00:20:26.267,"Look at this, Mama."
00:20:26.350,00:20:29.061,An editorial denouncing me in Redbook magazine.
00:20:29.812,00:20:34.233,Not in memory do we recall so fiendish and horrible a double homicide.
00:20:34.316,00:20:36.235,"Baby, you couldn't buy that kind of publicity."
00:20:36.318,00:20:37.611,Couldn't buy it?
00:20:40.322,00:20:42.116,"I guess I can keep this, then."
00:20:43.743,00:20:45.119,Nice try.
00:22:01.111,00:22:02.822,"Ah, yes!"
00:22:07.409,00:22:10.371,"It's kind of, uh, freezing in here."
00:22:10.454,00:22:13.499,You don't think maybe there's something wrong with the heat?
00:22:13.582,00:22:24.802,"Not that I'm complaining, mind you, but… but, you know, if you got a couple extra blankets tucked away-- Lights out, ladies."
00:22:40.359,00:22:41.527,Okay.
00:22:52.663,00:22:53.956,Okay.
00:23:43.631,00:23:52.056,"And now, the six merry murderesses of the Cook County Jail in their rendition of the Cell Block Tango."
00:26:00.476,00:26:04.021,"So, we started living together He'd go to work, he'd come home."
00:26:04.521,00:27:05.082,"I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner… And then he ran into my knife."
00:27:05.874,00:27:08.585,He ran into my knife ten times.
00:28:05.434,00:28:08.937,"So this one night before the show, we're down at the Hotel Cicero."
00:28:09.730,00:28:13.483,The three of us boozin' and havin' a few laughs.
00:28:13.567,00:28:16.612,"We run out of ice, So I go out to get some."
00:30:41.965,00:30:44.634,-Who belongs to them? -What's it to you?
00:30:44.718,00:30:47.387,Nothing. Heard they were Velma's.
00:30:47.471,00:30:50.390,Yeah. The Hunyak does all her laundry for a buck a week.
00:31:02.694,00:31:03.945,Make it quick.
00:31:08.825,00:31:11.244,I know a couple of things. Now hear me out on this.
00:31:11.328,00:31:13.830,"Now, Billy Flynn's set your trial date for March 5th."
00:31:13.955,00:31:15.332,"March 7th, you'll be acquitted."
00:31:15.874,00:31:18.585,"On March 8th, you know what Mama is gonna do for you?"
00:31:18.668,00:31:21.505,Mama is gonna put you back on the vaudeville circuit.
00:31:23.840,00:31:27.135,"installs a private line in your cell, all the calls have gotta go through me."
00:31:29.012,00:31:30.555,"You know, it's a crazy world."
00:31:30.639,00:31:34.810,"I mean, Babe Ruth is wearing rouge and playing the Palace for $5,000 a week."
00:31:39.940,00:31:44.403,"Due to your recent sensational activities, they think they can get you $2,500."
00:31:46.029,00:31:48.448,"Jeez, the most me and Veronica made was $350."
00:31:55.288,00:31:58.166,-Do you think you can get me that? -Big Jim's?
00:31:58.250,00:31:59.960,"-Yeah. -Jeez, I don't know."
00:32:00.043,00:32:01.586,That's gonna take another phone call.
00:32:01.670,00:32:04.464,"-How much is that gonna cost? -Come on, Vel."
00:32:04.548,00:32:06.758,You know how I feel about you. You're like family to me.
00:32:12.931,00:32:15.225,"You must get a lot of wrong numbers, Mama."
00:32:20.730,00:32:22.315,"Oh, Miss Kelly."
00:32:22.399,00:32:25.193,Got your personals. Freshly pressed by yours truly.
00:32:25.277,00:32:26.862,"No, no, it's my pleasure."
00:32:28.488,00:32:31.158,"Hey, listen, um, can I ask you something?"
00:32:32.284,00:32:33.869,You know that Harrison guy?
00:32:34.411,00:32:39.708,"Well, he said that what I done is a hanging case and that he's prepared to ask for the maximum penalty."
00:32:43.003,00:32:45.422,I sure would appreciate some advice.
00:32:45.505,00:32:49.134,Especially from someone I admire as much as you.
00:32:49.217,00:32:51.928,"Since I can remember, I have wanted to be on the stage."
00:32:52.012,00:32:54.681,Really? What's your talent? Washing and drying?
00:32:55.307,00:32:57.809,"No, no. I danced in the chorus."
00:32:58.560,00:33:02.022,"-That was before I met my husband, Amos. -Look, honey, you want some advice?"
00:33:02.105,00:33:04.441,Here it is. Direct from me to you.
00:33:04.524,00:33:07.777,"Keep your paws off my underwear, okay?"
00:33:10.530,00:33:11.781,"Yeah, okay."
00:33:13.533,00:33:14.701,Thanks.
00:33:15.827,00:33:17.704,For nothin'.
00:33:18.622,00:33:20.290,"She's something, ain't she?"
00:33:20.373,00:33:24.044,"I'll tell you, no matter how big she gets, she's still as common as ever."
00:33:24.127,00:33:25.587,"I'd like to help you, dearie."
00:33:28.256,00:33:29.758,Take a load off.
00:33:32.636,00:33:34.638,"So, what do you figure on using for grounds?"
00:33:35.839,00:33:37.652,-What do you mean grounds? -What are you gonna tell the jury?
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.851,I just figured I'd tell them the truth.
00:33:39.935,00:33:41.728,-The truth? -Yeah.
00:33:41.811,00:33:43.605,That's a one-way ticket to the death house.
00:33:43.688,00:33:45.857,-Holy Mother of God. -Relax.
00:33:45.941,00:33:49.194,"I mean, in this town, murder's a form of entertainment."
00:33:49.277,00:33:52.864,"Besides, in 47 years, Cook County ain't never hung a woman yet."
00:33:53.365,00:33:58.286,"So the odds are 47 to one -that they won't hang you. -Jesus, Mary, and Joseph."
00:33:58.370,00:34:01.831,You're talking to the wrong people. What you need is Billy Flynn.
00:34:02.749,00:34:04.668,-Who? -Billy Flynn.
00:34:04.751,00:34:07.379,He's only the best criminal lawyer in all of Illinois.
00:34:07.462,00:34:11.508,"I tell you, what he don't know about juries and women… How do you get this Billy Flynn?"
00:34:11.591,00:34:13.301,"Well, not by praying, dearie."
00:34:13.385,00:34:16.304,"First, you give me $100. Then I make a phone call."
00:34:16.388,00:34:22.394,"A hundred dollars? Well, you just… I mean, it seems pretty steep for a phone call."
00:34:22.488,00:34:24.104,"Oh, but he's worth every cent."
00:34:24.771,00:34:27.089,"I mean, he's never lost a case for a female client yet."
00:34:28.489,00:34:33.530,"With a sweet little puss like yours, well… let's just say justice ain't so blind in Chicago."
00:34:33.613,00:34:36.199,-He's never lost a case? -Never.
00:34:36.468,00:34:39.869,Every girl in this place would kill to have Billy Flynn represent her.
00:35:23.997,00:35:26.625,presenting the silver-tongued prince of the courtroom.
00:37:00.662,00:37:01.787,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
00:37:01.887,00:37:04.431,"Miss Kelly, do you remember anything at all about that night?"
00:37:04.514,00:37:07.517,"I passed out completely, Miss Sunshine. I can't remember a thing."
00:37:07.600,00:37:10.103,"-Only that I didn't do it. -Any idea who did, dear?"
00:37:10.228,00:37:14.774,"No, but my client is offering a substantial reward to anyone with information about this crime."
00:37:16.317,00:37:19.154,-I don't know. How much? -We'll work it out after the trial.
00:37:19.237,00:37:21.740,"Now if there are no more questions, Miss Kelly and I have a lot of work to do."
00:37:25.118,00:37:28.538,"-What's all this about a reward? -Awfully dumb, reporters."
00:37:28.621,00:37:30.665,They'll write it up wrong. You deny the whole thing later on.
00:37:30.749,00:37:32.673,"-Thank you. -Just one more question, please!"
00:37:38.298,00:37:41.593,"-Mama talked to you about me. -Oh, yeah, right. The cute one."
00:37:41.676,00:37:43.762,I was hoping that you might represent me.
00:37:43.845,00:37:45.221,"You got $5,000?"
00:37:49.225,00:37:51.311,"Mama didn't say anything about $5,000."
00:37:52.020,00:37:53.438,"Look here, Mr. Flynn."
00:37:54.397,00:38:01.780,"I'm not very good at this sort of thing, but maybe we could… make some sort of arrangement between us?"
00:38:01.863,00:38:03.948,I can be an awfully good sport.
00:38:04.574,00:38:07.076,"Good, you got that out of your system. Now, listen."
00:38:07.577,00:38:09.287,You mean just one thing to me.
00:38:09.788,00:38:11.581,"You call me when you got $5,000."
00:39:17.105,00:39:19.315,"Oh, he'll see you now."
00:39:23.611,00:39:25.446,"Well, hello, Andy."
00:39:25.530,00:39:27.240,My name is Amos.
00:39:27.323,00:39:28.908,That's right. Take a seat.
00:39:31.244,00:39:33.121,"You know, you're a remarkable man."
00:39:34.497,00:39:37.375,"Your wife two-times you, plugs the guy, then tries to pin it on you."
00:39:37.458,00:39:41.170,"Most men would let a dame like that swing. But, no, you're sticking by her."
00:39:41.254,00:39:45.008,-Makes you a hero in my eyes. -That's right. I'm a hero.
00:39:45.508,00:39:46.801,Did you bring the money?
00:39:48.428,00:39:50.388,I didn't do as well as I hoped.
00:39:50.471,00:39:53.433,"But I will, Mr. Flynn. I will."
00:39:55.268,00:39:56.644,This is only a thousand.
00:39:56.728,00:40:00.189,Plus there's $300 I borrowed from the guys down at the garage.
00:40:00.273,00:40:04.986,And then there's $700 from the building-and-loan fund.
00:40:05.069,00:40:06.178,Two thousand.
00:40:06.738,00:40:08.615,And that's all I got so far.
00:40:08.698,00:40:11.284,But I'll give you $20 off my salary every week.
00:40:11.678,00:40:13.061,I'll give you notes with interest.
00:40:13.244,00:40:14.787,Double. Triple. Till every cent is paid.
00:40:16.664,00:40:19.083,I didn't ask if she was guilty. I didn't ask if she was innocent.
00:40:19.167,00:40:22.211,I didn't ask if she was a drunk or a dope fiend. No.
00:40:22.295,00:40:25.381,"All I said was, Do you have $5,000? You said yes."
00:40:25.465,00:40:29.427,"But you don't have $5,000. So, I figure you're a dirty liar."
00:40:29.510,00:40:31.679,And I don't waste my time with dirty liars.
00:40:36.601,00:40:40.980,"Look. I'm real sorry, Mr. Flynn."
00:40:42.398,00:40:46.653,"On the other hand, your devotion to your wife is really very, very touching."
00:40:47.487,00:40:51.991,"I took your wife's case, and I'll keep it because I play square."
00:40:54.494,00:41:05.505,"Now, look, Hart, I don't like to blow my own horn, but believe me, if Jesus Christ had lived in Chicago today and if he had $5,000 and he'd come to me, things would've turned out differently."
00:41:08.633,00:41:12.887,"By the end of the week, I'm gonna have Roxie's name on the front page of every newspaper in town."
00:41:12.971,00:41:15.431,Sweetest little jazz killer ever to hit Chicago.
00:41:16.599,00:41:17.934,That's the angle I'm after.
00:41:18.017,00:41:20.770,You make an announcement we're gonna have an auction.
00:41:20.853,00:41:22.814,Tell them we gotta raise some money for her defense.
00:41:22.897,00:41:25.733,They'll buy everything she's ever touched. Everything!
00:41:25.942,00:41:28.403,"Your shoes, your dresses, your perfume, your underwear."
00:41:30.154,00:41:32.782,Like the one I was playing when I shot the bastard.
00:41:32.865,00:41:35.660,"-I didn't hear that. -Not that I didn't have grounds, mind you."
00:41:37.745,00:41:41.958,"Look, nobody, nobody's gonna care a lick what your defense is unless they care about you."
00:41:42.041,00:41:44.836,"So, the first thing that we gotta do is work up some sympathy from the press."
00:41:44.919,00:41:46.879,And they're not all pushovers like Mary Sunshine.
00:41:46.963,00:41:49.757,But there's one thing that they can never resist.
00:41:49.841,00:41:52.343,And that is a reformed sinner.
00:41:53.636,00:41:55.972,"So, tell me, what was your favorite subject in school?"
00:41:57.181,00:42:02.478,-I was a real dummy. -Come on. There must've been something -you were really good at. -I got high marks on courtesy and hygiene.
00:42:02.562,00:42:04.272,Perfect. You wanted to be a nun.
00:42:05.440,00:42:07.191,-A nun? -Where were you born?
00:42:07.275,00:42:09.485,On a chicken farm outside of Lubbock.
00:42:09.569,00:42:12.280,Beautiful southern home filled with every luxury and refinement.
00:42:12.363,00:42:13.489,Where are your parents now?
00:42:13.573,00:42:16.117,Probably on the front porch in their rocking chairs.
00:42:16.200,00:42:17.201,Parents dead.
00:42:17.285,00:42:20.496,Family fortune swept away. You were educated at the Sacred Heart.
00:42:21.080,00:42:25.543,"Then you fell into a runaway marriage. Left you miserable, alone, unhappy."
00:42:25.626,00:42:28.421,"And, of course, you got all swept up in the mad whirl of the city."
00:42:28.504,00:42:32.050,"Jazz, cabarets, liquor. You were drawn like a moth to the flame."
00:42:32.133,00:42:34.802,-A moth! -Now the mad whirl has ceased.
00:42:34.886,00:42:38.639,And you are a butterfly crushed on the wheel.
00:42:38.723,00:42:41.225,So which is it? Is it the moth or the butterfly?
00:42:41.309,00:42:43.478,"You have sinned, and you are sorry."
00:42:43.561,00:42:45.104,"God, that's beautiful."
00:42:46.230,00:42:48.858,Cut out God. Stay where you're better acquainted.
00:42:53.529,00:42:56.407,every man on that jury will want to take you home to meet his mother.
00:42:57.283,00:42:59.619,I was born on a beautiful Southern convent.
00:43:01.537,00:43:04.874,Holy shit! I'm never gonna get this straight.
00:43:04.957,00:43:10.254,"Pipe down the swearing. Look, from here on in, you say nothing rougher than Oh, dear. Now try again."
00:43:10.338,00:43:48.292,I was born on a… I thought I'd get all teary-eyed and ask to borrow your handkerchief.
00:43:48.376,00:43:51.379,Then I thought I'd take a peek at the jury like this.
00:43:51.462,00:43:54.132,"Flash 'em a bit of thigh, huh? What do you think?"
00:43:54.674,00:43:55.758,Sounds great.
00:44:03.891,00:44:05.601,You're at the top of my list.
00:44:06.978,00:44:08.688,"Well, well, well."
00:44:08.771,00:44:11.732,"Sorry to be late, Mr. Flynn."
00:44:18.990,00:44:20.283,I like it.
00:44:22.952,00:44:24.245,"Hey, Pollyanna."
00:44:25.204,00:44:27.540,I heard your press conference is tomorrow.
00:44:27.623,00:44:29.333,"Yeah, what's it to you?"
00:44:29.417,00:44:31.335,"Well, you wanted my advice, right?"
00:44:31.419,00:44:32.587,"Well, here it is."
00:44:33.087,00:44:36.716,Don't forget Billy Flynn's number-one client is Billy Flynn.
00:44:37.717,00:44:39.093,Meaning what?
00:44:40.303,00:44:43.556,Meaning don't let him hog the spotlight.
00:44:44.515,00:44:46.267,You're the one they pay to see.
00:44:57.987,00:44:59.572,-both reached for the gun. -That's right.
00:44:59.655,00:45:01.365,You both reached for the gun.
00:45:01.449,00:45:03.492,-You ready? -Yeah.
00:45:15.012,00:45:16.030,"Gentlemen, Miss Sunshine."
00:45:16.839,00:45:18.567,My client has just entered a plea of not guilty.
00:45:18.708,00:45:21.496,We look forward to a trial at the earliest possible date.
00:45:26.724,00:45:29.602,"-Miss Sunshine. -As you know, my paper is dry."
00:45:29.919,00:45:39.028,Do you have any advice for young girls seeking to avoid a life of jazz… Mrs. Hart feels that it was the tragic combination of liquor and jazz which led to her downfall.
00:45:39.111,00:45:49.205,"-Next question, please. -Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say how flattered I am -that y'all came to see me. -Mrs. Hart is very pleased-- You see, I was a moth crushed on the wheel."
00:45:49.288,00:45:56.743,"You know, a butterfly drawn to the… to the… I bet you want to know why I shot the bastard."
00:46:03.844,00:46:05.471,Notice how his mouth never moves.
00:46:06.047,00:46:07.173,Almost.
00:46:43.217,00:46:46.053,"Oh you poor dear, I can't believe what you've been through!"
00:46:46.137,00:46:48.764,"A convent girl, a runaway marriage."
00:46:48.980,00:50:04.126,"Now tell us, Roxie… The Windy City has taken a new criminal to its heart."
00:50:04.210,00:50:07.129,The name on everybody's lips is Roxie Hart.
00:50:07.213,00:50:10.341,The sweetest little lady ever accused of murder in Chicago.
00:50:10.424,00:50:13.552,Women want to look like her. Fellas want to go out with her.
00:50:13.677,00:50:16.388,Some little girls even want to take her home.
00:50:16.472,00:50:18.265,"Don't get any ideas, little lady."
00:50:18.349,00:50:24.906,"On the other side of town, the assistant D.A. promises the game little sharpshooter -will swing before the year is up. -She'll swing before the year is up."
00:50:24.972,00:50:30.903,"Who knows? If he lives up to his word, Assistant D.A. Harrison might become Governor Harrison someday."
00:50:31.745,00:50:36.492,"Back at the scene of the crime, everybody wants a little piece of Roxie Hart."
00:50:37.326,00:50:40.579,This jar of cold cream set her husband back $20.
00:50:41.330,00:50:45.459,Maybe this pretty little lady will get some of that famous Roxie style.
00:50:45.543,00:50:50.130,It seems everybody these days is rooting for Roxie Hart.
00:50:55.177,00:50:56.720,and make sure they know who sent them.
00:50:58.264,00:51:03.102,"So, kiddo, given any thought to what you want to do after Billy gets you off?"
00:51:03.269,00:51:05.479,Yeah. I think I'd like to go on the stage.
00:51:07.231,00:51:08.607,I already called the Morris office.
00:51:09.483,00:51:10.609,Really?
00:51:10.693,00:51:12.403,How much is that gonna cost me?
00:51:12.486,00:51:15.406,My standard deal. Ten percent of all your takings.
00:51:17.908,00:51:19.868,"Besides, I don't even have an act yet."
00:51:20.369,00:51:22.121,Killing Fred Casely was your act.
00:51:22.204,00:51:26.875,"I mean, that's all those stiffs in the audience want, -to say they saw somebody famous. -That's a freak act."
00:51:27.668,00:51:31.380,"And besides, I am better than that."
00:51:31.463,00:51:33.132,"Well, of course you are, cupcake."
00:51:33.882,00:51:35.968,"I mean, you can be as big as Sophie Tucker."
00:51:36.051,00:51:37.136,You really think so?
00:51:37.219,00:51:39.013,Bigger than Cantor and Jolson combined.
00:51:39.096,00:51:41.765,"You know, I've always wanted to have my name in all the papers."
00:51:42.600,00:51:47.146,"You know, before I met Amos, I used to date this well-to-do ugly bootlegger."
00:51:47.229,00:51:50.316,He used to like to take me out and show me off.
00:51:50.399,00:51:51.984,Ugly guys like to do that.
00:51:55.070,00:52:01.577,"Once, it said in the paper, Gangland's Al Capelli seen at Chez Vito with cute blond chorine."
00:52:02.745,00:52:03.954,That was me.
00:52:04.747,00:52:06.457,I clipped it and I saved it.
00:52:07.791,00:52:11.503,"You know, all my life, I wanted to have my own act."
00:52:12.046,00:52:16.258,"But, no, no, no, no, always no. They always turned me down."
00:52:16.800,00:52:19.470,One big world full of no.
00:52:22.139,00:52:24.433,And then Amos came along.
00:52:26.518,00:52:32.316,"Safe, sweet Amos… who never says no."
00:52:37.112,00:52:38.864,I've never done this before.
00:52:39.698,00:52:42.451,"But, you know, it is such a special night."
00:52:46.372,00:52:51.794,"And… And I just-- I really feel like I can talk to you, you know?"
00:52:53.003,00:52:55.506,So forget what you've read in the papers.
00:52:55.589,00:52:57.841,And forget what you've heard on the radio!
00:52:57.925,00:53:02.054,Because I'm gonna tell you the truth.
00:53:07.893,00:53:09.687,But I'm gonna tell you anyway.
00:53:11.480,00:53:18.195,In the bed department… Amos was zero.
00:53:19.613,00:53:26.412,"I mean, when he made love to me, it was like he was fixing a carburetor or something."
00:53:26.620,00:53:29.748,"I love ya, honey, I love ya."
00:53:31.792,00:53:34.920,"Anyway, I started fooling around."
00:53:36.714,00:53:41.927,"Then I started screwing around, which is fooling around without dinner."
00:53:43.846,00:53:48.517,"Then I met Fred Casely, who said that he could get me into vaudeville."
00:53:50.144,00:53:52.479,But that didn't quite work out like I planned.
00:53:54.231,00:53:56.984,"I guess it didn't really work out too great for Fred, either."
00:53:58.569,00:54:07.369,"So, I gave up on the whole vaudeville idea, because you kinda figure after all those years… opportunity's just passed you by."
00:54:13.667,00:54:15.127,And now?
00:54:15.210,00:54:22.801,"Well, if this Flynn guy gets me off… with all this publicity, I got me a world full of yes!"
00:56:14.913,00:56:16.623,I'm a star.
00:56:17.124,00:56:21.753,And the audience loves me. And I love them.
00:56:22.254,00:56:25.007,And they love me for loving them.
00:56:25.090,00:56:28.135,And I love them for loving me.
00:56:28.635,00:56:31.680,And we love each other.
00:56:32.764,00:56:36.059,And that's 'cause none of us got enough love in our childhoods.
00:56:36.768,00:56:41.773,And that's showbiz… kid.
00:57:37.579,00:57:38.956,I just can't take it anymore.
00:57:39.039,00:57:42.417,You can't go anywhere without hearing about that dumb tomato!
00:57:44.711,00:57:47.005,"Oh, no, Mama, not you too."
00:57:48.632,00:57:51.009,"I have some bad news, kid. The tour has been canceled."
00:57:51.093,00:57:52.135,What?
00:57:52.219,00:57:53.887,Your name's been out of the papers too long.
00:57:53.971,00:57:56.390,All you read about today is that Hart kid.
00:57:56.473,00:57:57.557,She's hot.
00:57:59.768,00:58:02.312,"And what am I supposed to do, huh?"
00:58:03.021,00:58:05.190,Suck up to her like everybody else?
00:58:05.273,00:58:06.608,It couldn't hurt.
00:58:07.109,00:58:09.695,Over my dead body.
00:58:09.861,00:58:11.488,Mind if I join you?
00:58:16.284,00:58:17.411,Smoke?
00:58:20.497,00:58:22.457,Look what some Johnny sent me.
00:58:22.958,00:58:26.795,Triple-cream caramels all the way from San Francisco.
00:58:28.171,00:58:31.341,"…I'm watching my figure. You know, the trial."
00:58:34.344,00:58:37.139,"Hey, great mention of you in the Trib today, huh?"
00:58:43.603,00:58:47.524,"Hey, did I ever tell you, you are exactly the same size as my sister?"
00:58:47.607,00:58:49.901,"I mean, you'd fit into her costumes perfectly."
00:58:52.029,00:59:00.454,"And I was thinking, you know, with all the publicity that's piled up between us, and when Billy gets us off, we'd be a natural to do an act together."
00:59:00.620,00:59:02.164,"You think so, huh?"
00:59:08.336,00:59:12.215,Miss Velma Kelly in an act of desperation.
00:59:50.253,00:59:51.338,Watch this.
00:59:52.506,00:59:54.758,"Now, you have to imagine it with two people."
00:59:54.841,00:59:56.343,It's swell with two people.
01:01:00.699,01:01:06.121,"And we'd say, Okay, fellas, keep your socks up 'cause you ain't seen nothin' yet."
01:01:21.344,01:01:22.929,"So, what do you think, huh?"
01:01:24.014,01:01:25.849,"Come on, you can say."
01:01:31.271,01:01:33.690,I know. You're right. The first part's shit.
01:01:33.773,01:01:37.736,"But the second part, the second part is really nifty."
01:01:38.695,01:01:40.030,Okay.
01:02:14.981,01:02:17.984,"And we'd say, Okay, boys, we're going home."
01:02:18.068,01:02:21.613,"But before we go, here's a few more partin' shots."
01:02:21.696,01:02:24.491,"And this, this we did in perfect unison."
01:02:52.644,01:02:55.188,"So, where was the part where you blew her brains out?"
01:02:56.231,01:02:58.066,"Okay, Roxie, I'll level with you."
01:02:58.149,01:03:00.151,"Oh, no, no, no. Don't bother."
01:03:00.235,01:03:01.653,You think you're fooling me?
01:03:02.153,01:03:05.115,"You're all washed up, and it's me they want now."
01:03:05.198,01:03:07.242,And I'm a big star.
01:03:08.159,01:03:09.369,Single.
01:03:09.452,01:03:13.581,"Oh, I almost forgot. You were in the paper today, too."
01:03:14.291,01:03:16.209,"In the back, with the obituaries."
01:03:16.960,01:03:21.214,Velma Kelly's trial has been postponed indefinitely.
01:03:24.217,01:03:26.177,Seven words. Wow.
01:03:28.847,01:03:31.599,Oh. And here's a little piece of advice.
01:03:32.934,01:03:34.686,Direct from me to you.
01:03:34.769,01:03:36.229,Lay off the caramels.
01:03:49.868,01:03:53.913,You night owls who only come alive after dark.
01:03:53.997,01:03:59.419,"We dedicate this tune, Chicago After Midnight."
01:04:09.637,01:04:11.514,Incredible. Incredible.
01:04:12.640,01:04:14.434,"All right. Yeah. Thanks, Tom."
01:04:16.019,01:04:19.439,"Oh, God! They just arrested this woman for a triple homicide."
01:04:20.023,01:04:21.566,-Really? -Yeah. And get this.
01:04:21.649,01:04:23.943,-She's an heiress. Yeah. -What?
01:04:24.027,01:04:28.323,"All the family's in… pineapples, grapefruits… Some kind of fruit, I don't know."
01:04:28.406,01:04:37.248,"So anyhow, this dame, Kitty what's-her-name, something… she's playing house on the North Side in an apartment with a guy named Harry."
01:04:37.332,01:04:42.003,"What Harry does for a living, no one's quite sure, but it doesn't really matter because she's footing all the bills."
01:04:42.087,01:04:44.255,"Anyhow, Kitty comes home tonight."
01:04:44.339,01:04:46.674,"Harry's already in bed, which is par for the course for Harry."
01:04:46.758,01:04:52.555,"She goes to change. When she returns, she notices something rather odd."
01:04:54.808,01:04:56.267,Extremely odd.
01:05:01.606,01:05:04.734,Kitty disappears for a second. Cool as a cucumber.
01:05:05.276,01:05:08.863,"When she returns, she gently wakes up Harry."
01:05:10.782,01:05:12.367,"Harry says, What? I'm alone."
01:05:13.201,01:05:16.329,"She says, Alone? You got two other women in bed with you."
01:05:17.247,01:05:21.042,"So, get this. Harry says, Come on, doll."
01:05:21.167,01:05:23.656,You gonna believe what you see or what I tell you?
01:05:33.680,01:05:35.056,"Good night, folks."
01:05:41.646,01:05:42.981,Give us the line!
01:05:44.065,01:05:46.401,"Miss Sunshine, from the Evening Star."
01:05:46.609,01:05:48.862,I wonder if you wouldn't mind saying a word or two?
01:05:48.945,01:05:51.406,"Sure, I'll say three. Go to hell!"
01:05:52.157,01:05:54.033,Please direct your questions to her counsel.
01:05:54.117,01:05:56.619,"You're not my counsel, and I want my money back."
01:05:56.870,01:05:58.288,It's not your money. It's your mother's money.
01:05:58.371,01:06:01.124,"-Are you sorry, dear? -Sure, I'm sorry."
01:06:01.207,01:06:02.792,Sorry I got caught.
01:06:04.294,01:06:06.296,"-Hey, Miss Sunshine? -Not now, Roxie."
01:06:06.379,01:06:11.134,"I got a letter from a guy. He says he's going on a hunger strike -until I'm freed. -That's nice, dear."
01:06:11.217,01:06:14.971,"-Miss Baxter, please! -Miss Baxter, did you know these two ladies personally?"
01:06:16.222,01:06:18.766,Did I know these two ladies personally? Was that your question?
01:06:20.143,01:06:25.523,"Yeah, that's my qu-- She's very high-spirited, isn't she?"
01:06:25.607,01:06:27.025,Miss Baxter?
01:06:27.108,01:06:28.693,"Hey, Mr. Flynn!"
01:06:29.527,01:06:30.528,Mr. Flynn!
01:06:30.612,01:06:32.405,"-Yeah, hi, Trixie. -It's Roxie."
01:06:32.489,01:06:35.658,"-Yeah, sure, I was just kidding. -Did you get my trial date yet?"
01:06:36.451,01:06:39.162,"-Listen, kid-- -Yeah, I'm at the top of your list, right?"
01:06:39.245,01:06:40.538,Go to hell!
01:06:40.622,01:06:42.665,"Boy, what a hellion, huh?"
01:06:43.166,01:06:44.751,"She's a socialite, too."
01:06:44.834,01:06:46.544,Her mother owns all the pineapples in Hawaii.
01:06:46.628,01:06:48.379,What the hell do I care about pineapples?
01:06:48.463,01:06:50.006,-All right. -Listen. Hey!
01:06:52.300,01:06:54.260,Miss Baxter will answer all of your questions.
01:06:54.344,01:06:56.804,"And afterwards, I'll be happy to give you an interview myself."
01:07:05.897,01:07:08.566,J. Edgar Hoover couldn't find your name in the papers.
01:07:15.782,01:07:23.706,"Mr. Flynn… Roxie! What is it, dear?"
01:07:26.876,01:07:29.879,"Oh, oh. Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about me."
01:07:31.297,01:07:34.592,"Oh, I only hope the fall didn't hurt the baby."
01:07:34.717,01:07:35.635,Baby?
01:07:36.386,01:07:37.387,Shit!
01:07:37.971,01:07:39.055,What?
01:07:43.393,01:07:46.396,"Roxie, when did this happen, darling?"
01:08:07.417,01:08:09.711,"Well, doc, is she or isn't she?"
01:08:10.503,01:08:11.629,She is.
01:08:14.632,01:08:16.759,Would you swear to that statement in court?
01:08:17.260,01:08:19.053,-Yes. -Good.
01:08:19.971,01:08:21.306,Button your fly.
01:08:32.567,01:08:39.866,"I would… I would just like to say that… Well, my own life doesn't matter now, just that of my unborn child."
01:08:43.369,01:08:44.871,My readers won't stand for it.
01:08:44.954,01:08:49.292,I can assure you that won't happen. She'll come to trial at the earliest possible moment. Please quote me on that.
01:08:49.375,01:08:50.877,"Well, I think it's sweet."
01:08:50.960,01:08:53.296,First time we ever had one of our girls knocked up.
01:08:54.047,01:08:56.049,"-When is the baby due, Roxie? -Roxie!"
01:08:56.132,01:08:57.884,"Hey, Roxie! Roxie!"
01:08:58.926,01:09:00.803,"Roxie, I just heard the good news!"
01:09:01.387,01:09:03.681,I'm the father! I'm the father!
01:09:03.765,01:09:05.183,"Roxie, who's the father?"
01:09:05.266,01:09:07.393,That question is completely out of line.
01:09:07.477,01:09:10.647,"How dare you insult this brave, young woman."
01:09:13.775,01:09:15.026,"Roxie! Roxie, honey!"
01:09:16.152,01:09:18.571,It's me! Daddy! It's Daddy!
01:09:21.199,01:09:23.201,"Roxie, I came as soon as I could!"
01:11:18.024,01:11:20.526,"Look, Andy, I'm afraid I got to hit you hard."
01:11:21.194,01:11:23.237,And I can only hope that you'll be big about it.
01:11:23.362,01:11:25.239,Amos. My name is Amos.
01:11:25.323,01:11:26.616,Who said it wasn't?
01:11:27.241,01:11:30.411,"It was the kid. The kid 's name I was thinking about, yeah."
01:11:30.495,01:11:32.705,You know when she's due? September.
01:11:33.748,01:11:39.670,"But pass out those cigars, anyway. I don't want you to give a damn -when people… -People what?"
01:11:41.297,01:11:43.216,-Laugh. -Laugh? Why would they laugh?
01:11:43.299,01:11:44.425,'Cause they can count.
01:11:45.009,01:11:47.678,Can you count? September.
01:11:51.265,01:11:55.561,Here's a copy of Roxie's first statement from the D.A.'s office.
01:11:55.770,01:11:58.856,It says she hadn't copulated with you for four months prior to the incident.
01:11:58.940,01:12:00.483,"Well, she would know."
01:12:01.651,01:12:09.242,"Yeah, I guess we hadn't done no copulating since… Wait a minute. That don't figure out right."
01:12:09.325,01:12:11.744,I… I couldn't be the father.
01:12:11.828,01:12:14.664,"Well, forget about that now. My client needs your support."
01:12:14.747,01:12:16.457,You mean she needs a meal ticket.
01:12:16.541,01:12:17.959,That's all I ever been.
01:12:18.042,01:12:21.087,-But this time she's gone too far. -What are you gonna do?
01:12:22.380,01:12:24.590,-Divorce her? -You're damn right!
01:12:24.674,01:12:25.883,I'll divorce her!
01:12:28.177,01:12:29.804,She probably won't even notice.
01:12:34.308,01:12:36.602,"Yeah? Yeah, put him through."
01:13:02.712,01:13:03.754,"You still here, Andy?"
01:13:04.088,01:13:05.923,"Yeah, I'm still here."
01:13:07.300,01:13:08.384,I think.
01:14:09.904,01:14:12.573,I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
01:14:17.912,01:14:20.206,I've been waiting here for ten minutes. Don't do that again.
01:14:20.289,01:14:23.542,This dress makes me look like a Woolworth's lampshade.
01:14:23.626,01:14:26.754,-I'm not wearing this. -You're wearing it -'cause I tell you to wear it. -I'm not wearing this dress!
01:14:26.837,01:14:29.715,"And when Andy's on the stand, -I want you to be knitting. -Knitting?"
01:14:29.799,01:14:31.759,-For Christ's sake. -A baby garment.
01:14:31.842,01:14:33.594,-I don't know how to knit! -Then learn.
01:14:33.678,01:14:36.180,That is no way to win a jury's sympathy.
01:14:36.263,01:14:44.647,"-You don't need advice anymore. -Lookit here, Mr. Mouthpiece, it seems to me I am the one who's coming up with the good ideas."
01:14:44.981,01:14:47.191,I am sick of everybody telling me what to do.
01:14:47.274,01:14:48.693,You treat me like dirt.
01:14:48.776,01:14:52.029,You know that? You treat me like I'm some dumb common criminal.
01:14:52.113,01:14:54.031,But you are some dumb common criminal.
01:14:54.115,01:14:57.326,"Well, it's better than being a greasy Mick lawyer."
01:14:57.410,01:14:58.911,Who happens to be saving your ass!
01:14:58.995,01:15:01.330,Who's out for all he can steal!
01:15:01.414,01:15:03.207,Maybe you'd like to appear in court without me.
01:15:03.290,01:15:05.918,"Well, maybe I could. Have you read the morning papers?"
01:15:06.002,01:15:08.254,-They love me! -Wise up!
01:15:08.337,01:15:10.047,They'd love you a lot more if you were hanged.
01:15:10.131,01:15:11.841,You know why? 'Cause they'd sell more papers.
01:15:11.924,01:15:13.926,-You're fired. -I quit.
01:15:15.302,01:15:18.055,Any lawyer in this town would die to have my case.
01:15:18.639,01:15:22.059,You are a phony celebrity. You're a flash in the pan.
01:15:22.143,01:15:24.455,"In a couple of weeks, no one's gonna give a shit about you."
01:15:25.646,01:15:27.064,That's Chicago.
01:15:36.824,01:15:39.368,-What happened? -It's the Hunyak.
01:15:39.952,01:15:41.454,She lost her last appeal.
01:15:41.954,01:15:43.372,"So, what's that mean?"
01:15:44.707,01:16:14.236,"Well, that means that next week, she's gonna… This is Mary Sunshine coming to you from the Cook County Jail where history will be made today. Katalin Helinski will become the first woman in the state of Illinois to be executed."
01:16:14.862,01:16:26.624,"And so, ladies and gentlemen… for your pleasure and your entertainment, we proudly present Katalin Helinski and her famous Hungarian disappearing act."
01:18:03.846,01:18:07.128,"You know, it's really not that bad."
01:18:07.474,01:18:09.393,You clear about everything we agreed on?
01:18:09.518,01:18:11.812,Yep. I've been up all night rehearsing.
01:18:11.896,01:18:14.106,What do you do when Harrison starts coming after you?
01:18:14.190,01:18:17.359,"I sit still and look straight ahead, never at the jury."
01:18:17.443,01:18:19.195,-And? -And I look modest.
01:18:19.695,01:18:24.116,-And? -And… -And say nothing. -That's right.
01:18:24.200,01:18:25.701,"-That was the deal, right? -Right."
01:18:25.784,01:18:28.204,Right. You asked me back. I do all the talking this time.
01:18:28.287,01:18:30.915,"Absolutely, Billy. Whatever you say."
01:18:30.998,01:18:33.125,Mr. Flynn. His Honor's here.
01:18:33.209,01:18:34.210,Thank you.
01:18:36.128,01:18:37.296,You ready?
01:18:37.922,01:18:39.006,Yeah.
01:18:42.509,01:18:44.136,-Billy. -Hm?
01:18:46.263,01:18:47.431,I'm scared.
01:18:50.142,01:18:53.854,"Nah, don't be. I've been around a long time."
01:18:53.938,01:18:56.065,Believe me. You got nothing to worry about.
01:18:58.943,01:19:00.319,It's all a circus.
01:19:01.320,01:19:02.613,A three-ring circus.
01:19:03.405,01:19:05.282,"These trials, the whole world."
01:19:06.659,01:19:08.285,It's all just show business.
01:19:10.454,01:19:15.376,"But, kid… you're working with a star."
01:21:08.364,01:21:09.948,-I object! -Sustained.
01:21:10.032,01:21:11.992,"Your Honor, I haven't even asked the question yet."
01:22:10.551,01:22:11.760,"Hello, Amos."
01:22:12.136,01:22:14.847,"Amos. That's right, Mr. Flynn."
01:22:14.930,01:22:16.014,-Amos. -Amos.
01:22:16.640,01:22:19.143,-When did you file suit for divorce? -A month ago.
01:22:19.226,01:22:21.603,Was there any reason for filing it at this particular time?
01:22:21.687,01:22:22.563,I'll say.
01:22:23.272,01:22:26.316,The newspapers said Roxie was expecting a little stranger.
01:22:26.400,01:22:28.444,"That's hardly grounds for divorce, is it?"
01:22:28.527,01:22:30.237,A little too much of a stranger.
01:22:30.404,01:22:31.280,Oh!
01:22:31.822,01:22:34.950,By that you mean you doubted the paternity of the child.
01:22:35.033,01:22:36.910,"-Well, sure. -Tell me something, Amos."
01:22:36.994,01:22:39.538,"-You share a bed with your wife? -Yes, sir, every night."
01:22:39.621,01:22:48.172,"And you expect this jury to believe that you slept next to this woman every night without exercising your rights -as a husband? -Well, I could've if I wanted to."
01:22:48.255,01:22:50.048,"-Oh, but you didn't. -No, I did."
01:22:50.132,01:22:51.341,-Did what? -Want to.
01:22:51.425,01:22:52.968,-But you didn't. -Didn't what?
01:22:53.051,01:22:55.679,-What you wanted. -Wait a minute. I'm getting confused here.
01:22:55.804,01:22:59.683,"Now you tell me, did you ever question Roxie herself?"
01:22:59.766,01:23:02.769,Did you even bother to ask her if you were the father of her child?
01:23:02.853,01:23:03.937,"-No, sir. -No."
01:23:04.021,01:23:08.942,"But if you became convinced that you were wrong, you'd be man enough to admit it, wouldn't you?"
01:23:09.026,01:23:13.655,"You'd even be willing to take her back, if Roxie swore that you were the father of her child."
01:23:13.739,01:23:15.407,-Which she does. -She does?
01:23:18.619,01:23:20.787,She does! She does!
01:23:20.871,01:23:23.665,No more questions! You can step down now.
01:23:24.750,01:23:26.376,"Well done, Andy."
01:23:27.503,01:23:29.254,"Roxie, I'm so sorry."
01:24:14.925,01:24:19.263,Roxie Hart finally takes the stand in her own defense.
01:24:33.443,01:24:34.736,Order!
01:24:36.738,01:24:38.283,"Proceed, Mr. Flynn."
01:24:38.574,01:24:44.413,"Roxie, I have here a statement in which you admit to having illicit relations with the deceased, Fred Casely."
01:24:44.496,01:24:45.872,Is this statement true or false?
01:24:45.956,01:24:47.374,I'm afraid that's true.
01:24:47.457,01:24:49.042,"You're an honest girl, Roxie."
01:24:50.127,01:24:52.170,When did you first meet Fred Casely?
01:24:52.504,01:24:54.756,When he sold Amos and me our furniture.
01:24:54.840,01:24:59.011,"Your personal relationship with him, could you tell the jury when that began?"
01:24:59.094,01:25:01.763,When I permitted him to escort me home one night.
01:25:01.847,01:25:06.893,I don't think I would've gone with him if Mr. Hart and me hadn't quarreled that very morning.
01:25:06.977,01:25:08.186,"-Quarreled? -Yes, sir."
01:25:08.270,01:25:10.772,"Well, I suppose it was his fault."
01:25:10.856,01:25:12.816,"Oh, no, sir. It was my fault."
01:25:13.567,01:25:16.486,I suppose I just couldn't stop pestering him.
01:25:16.570,01:25:18.196,Pestering him? About what?
01:25:18.280,01:25:21.199,I didn't like him working those long hours at the garage.
01:25:21.283,01:25:26.238,I wanted him home with me… to darn his socks and iron his shirts.
01:25:26.496,01:25:28.749,I wanted a real home and a child.
01:25:29.374,01:25:34.671,"So, you drifted into this illicit relationship because you were unhappy -at home. -Yes."
01:25:34.880,01:25:36.548,I was most unhappy.
01:25:37.883,01:25:39.156,Roxie Hart!
01:25:39.656,01:25:42.506,The state has accused you of the murder of Fred Casely!
01:25:42.656,01:25:45.641,Are you guilty -or not guilty? -I'm not guilty.
01:25:45.932,01:25:50.228,"I'm not guilty. I killed him. I did, but I'm not a criminal."
01:25:50.312,01:25:51.688,I'm not a criminal!
01:25:55.067,01:25:58.528,Roxie… -Uh-huh. -Yeah.
01:25:58.904,01:26:01.114,Do you recall the night of January 14?
01:26:01.823,01:26:02.699,Uh-huh.
01:26:02.824,01:26:06.453,"Could you tell the jury, in your own words, the happenings of that night?"
01:26:06.536,01:26:11.333,"Well, when Fred came over, I told him my good news."
01:26:11.416,01:26:12.292,And what was that?
01:26:13.210,01:26:15.962,That me and Amos were gonna have a baby.
01:26:16.546,01:26:19.007,And that it was all over between us.
01:26:19.091,01:26:20.467,What happened then?
01:26:20.550,01:26:28.850,"Well, then… Then… Did he threaten you, Roxie?"
01:26:28.934,01:26:30.852,"Objection, Your Honor. Counsel is leading the witness!"
01:26:30.977,01:26:31.895,Sustained.
01:26:35.565,01:26:38.777,What did Casely say when you told him the news?
01:26:39.861,01:26:43.598,I'll kill you before I'll see you have another man's child!
01:26:43.824,01:26:46.243,Could you tell the audience-- the jury what happened next?
01:26:46.566,01:26:51.289,"Well, in his passion… he tore off my robe, and he threw me on the bed."
01:26:51.373,01:26:54.626,And Mr. Hart's pistol was lying there between us.
01:26:54.751,01:27:01.383,"-And then? -And then we both reached for the gun, but I got it first. And then he came toward me with this funny look in his eyes."
01:27:01.466,01:27:03.343,He was angry and wild!
01:27:03.510,01:27:04.886,-Wild! -Wild!
01:27:04.970,01:27:06.471,Did you think he meant to kill you?
01:27:06.555,01:27:08.181,"Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir."
01:27:08.265,01:27:09.683,So it was his life or yours?
01:27:09.766,01:27:10.892,And not just mine.
01:27:10.976,01:27:13.895,"I closed my eyes, and I shot!"
01:27:13.979,01:27:15.605,In defense of your life!
01:27:15.689,01:27:19.776,"To save my husband's innocent, unborn child!"
01:27:24.573,01:27:25.574,-Roxie! -Order!
01:27:26.908,01:27:28.869,"What a bull's-eye, huh?"
01:27:29.578,01:27:31.037,Order in this court!
01:27:31.121,01:27:32.038,Roxie!
01:27:32.581,01:27:36.918,I'll clear this court -if necessary. -There's pandemonium -here in the courtroom. -Order!
01:27:39.421,01:27:41.548,throughout this ordeal has been truly extraordinary.
01:27:41.631,01:27:42.758,"Yeah, I bet it has."
01:27:44.613,01:27:46.136,with her attorney's handkerchief.
01:27:46.219,01:27:47.306,Handkerchief?
01:27:48.930,01:27:52.017,"She looks around now bewildered, seeming to want something."
01:27:52.559,01:27:53.810,"Oh, it's a glass of water."
01:27:53.894,01:27:57.314,"Mama, that was my bit, I told Billy I was gonna do that at my trial!"
01:28:00.734,01:28:02.861,Mrs. Hart has fainted again.
01:28:02.986,01:28:03.862,"Oh, jeez."
01:28:06.740,01:28:10.160,revealing a glimpse of a blue garter with a rhinestone buckle.
01:28:10.243,01:28:11.953,"Mama, she stole my garter."
01:28:12.037,01:28:14.998,-She stole my garter! -Don't break my radio!
01:28:15.081,01:28:19.461,"God! First, the slob steals my publicity. Then she steals my lawyer, my trial date."
01:28:19.544,01:28:21.129,Now she stole my goddamn garter!
01:28:21.213,01:28:22.464,What do you expect?
01:28:22.589,01:28:26.802,"I mean, these days you get a little success, and it's good riddance to the people who put you there."
01:28:27.969,01:28:29.888,There ain't no justice in the world.
01:28:29.971,01:28:32.140,And there ain't nothing you can do about it.
01:28:32.641,01:28:37.270,Nerts to that. You think I got you up here just so you can listen to my radio?
01:28:38.271,01:28:42.108,People write some pretty interesting things when they think no one's looking.
01:28:50.450,01:28:51.701,"Oh, Mama."
01:28:52.369,01:28:53.245,Ooh!
01:29:06.258,01:29:08.009,"Left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand."
01:29:08.093,01:29:11.721,"You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, -so help you God? -And then some."
01:29:12.013,01:29:13.139,Have a seat.
01:29:14.432,01:29:16.226,"Would you state your name for the record, please?"
01:29:16.309,01:29:23.525,"-Velma Kelly. -Miss Kelly, will you please tell the court if the object I am holding is the one you happened to come upon in the defendant's jail cell?"
01:29:23.608,01:29:24.818,"Yes, it is."
01:29:24.901,01:29:26.695,I submit this as Exhibit X.
01:29:27.445,01:29:28.697,Roxie Hart's diary.
01:29:29.030,01:29:30.240,I object!
01:29:30.323,01:29:40.542,"My client has never kept a diary. And even if she did, this would be invasion of privacy in violation of the Fourth Amendment -and illegal search without a warrant. -Yeah. And she broke the lock."
01:29:44.129,01:29:47.090,"Well, that settles that. I'll allow it."
01:29:47.173,01:29:48.675,What's the big deal?
01:29:48.758,01:29:50.615,-It's just a bunch of doodlings. -Shh!
01:29:50.752,01:29:52.420,"If you would read for us, please, Miss Kelly."
01:29:53.763,01:29:55.223,I haven't worked in a while.
01:29:56.433,01:29:59.477,"What a laugh, plugging Fred Casely."
01:29:59.853,01:30:01.938,-What? -The big baboon had it coming.
01:30:02.564,01:30:05.775,I'm just sorry I only got to kill him once.
01:30:05.859,01:30:12.157,I never wrote that! You… -Order! -She made that up!
01:30:12.282,01:30:13.533,-She made that up! -Order!
01:30:13.867,01:30:16.578,"Please, Mr. Flynn, get control of your client."
01:30:16.661,01:30:18.371,"I'm sorry, Your Honor. It won't happen again."
01:30:18.455,01:30:20.790,Sit down. Shut up. It's only making it worse.
01:30:21.541,01:30:22.959,I have no more questions.
01:30:24.502,01:30:26.046,"Your witness, Mr. Flynn."
01:30:27.881,01:30:30.550,"Ladies and gentlemen, a tap dance."
01:30:37.432,01:30:40.101,"Tell me, Miss Kelly, did you make a deal with Mr. Harrison?"
01:30:42.020,01:30:45.023,Maybe to drop all charges against you in exchange for testifying here today?
01:30:45.231,01:30:46.900,"Well, sure. I'm not a complete idiot."
01:30:49.736,01:30:51.071,Good. Good.
01:30:52.280,01:30:57.619,"Since you gave such an impressive performance for Mr. Harrison, maybe you'd do me the same honor."
01:30:57.702,01:30:59.120,-I'd be delighted. -Thank you.
01:31:01.790,01:31:05.585,Fred Casely assured me he'd get me an audition down at the Onyx.
01:31:06.294,01:31:10.715,"Then he reneged on his pledge, and that was my motive for attacking him."
01:31:10.799,01:31:15.178,"Pretty fancy way of saying He's a big fat liar who welshed on a deal, so I shot him."
01:31:18.848,01:31:25.397,"Amos accused me of having an affair, so I told him that the charge was erroneous."
01:31:25.605,01:31:27.148,"Objection, Your Honor!"
01:31:27.232,01:31:31.361,Mr. Flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions -that are specious and… -Erroneous?
01:31:31.444,01:31:32.320,Exactly!
01:31:38.410,01:31:40.662,"Miss Kelly, do you know the meaning of the word perjury?"
01:31:40.954,01:31:43.248,"-Yes, I do. -You also know that it's a crime?"
01:31:44.833,01:31:53.008,"if it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake, I'd hate to think of you rotting in prison for the next ten years, especially since you just won your freedom."
01:31:53.091,01:31:55.051,"Look, all I know is what I was told."
01:31:59.097,01:32:00.515,Oh. So… All right.
01:32:00.724,01:32:04.644,So you didn't find this diary in Roxie's cell?
01:32:05.562,01:32:06.646,No.
01:32:07.147,01:32:11.568,Mama-- Miss Morton gave it to me. She said someone sent it to her.
01:32:11.651,01:32:15.321,Someone? Any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be?
01:32:15.405,01:32:17.157,No. She didn't know.
01:32:17.240,01:32:18.950,"All right, let's see if we can work this out."
01:32:19.034,01:32:26.166,Someone who writes about reneging on pledges and erroneous charges.
01:32:27.000,01:32:30.754,Call me crazy. Doesn't that sound like a lawyer to you? A lawyer.
01:32:30.837,01:32:34.049,A lawyer who obviously had a sample of my client's handwriting.
01:32:35.383,01:32:38.261,"Mr. Harrison, didn't you ask Roxie to write out a confession for you?"
01:32:38.762,01:32:41.222,"Yes. But you're not suggesting I tampered with evidence, are you?"
01:32:41.347,01:32:44.142,No. I wouldn't. Don't be ridiculous. No.
01:32:44.392,01:32:46.561,That's thoroughly and utterly absurd.
01:32:47.687,01:32:51.900,"But now that you mention it… -Your Honor, this is outrageous! -It's outrageous! I know. I agree."
01:32:51.983,01:33:04.037,"To even suggest that the prosecutor would make a thieves' bargain with the notorious Velma Kelly, and then fabricate the very evidence that set her free -just so you can win another case -Your Honor… and move one step closer to the Governor's Mansion!"
01:33:04.120,01:33:07.874,"Why, it's simply beyond all imagining!"
01:33:08.124,01:33:11.336,"-I'll hold you in contempt! -No, it is not even conceivable!"
01:33:11.586,01:33:16.716,"But if it were, wouldn't it be time to say, Come clean, Mr. Harrison! Come clean?"
01:33:16.850,01:33:20.020,"Even in Chicago, this kind of corruption cannot stand!"
01:33:22.931,01:33:24.474,"I agree, Your Honor!"
01:33:25.183,01:33:26.309,It is enough!
01:33:27.936,01:33:29.437,The defense rests.
01:33:36.820,01:33:39.614,reporting live from the Cook County Courthouse.
01:33:40.406,01:33:47.330,The city of Chicago has come to a complete standstill as the trial of the century finally draws to a close.
01:33:48.206,01:33:54.921,"Mrs. Hart sits quietly at the defense table, hands folded, wondering what fate has in store for her."
01:33:55.713,01:34:01.427,And now a hush falls over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats.
01:34:03.930,01:34:06.391,"Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?"
01:34:08.101,01:34:09.310,"We have, Your Honor."
01:34:10.770,01:34:12.105,The jury has reached a verdict.
01:34:13.481,01:34:15.400,Will the defendant please rise?
01:34:18.695,01:34:20.113,What is your verdict?
01:34:21.489,01:34:39.841,"We, the jury, find the defendant… Roxie Hart is innocent! She's innocent!"
01:34:40.091,01:34:41.050,Get your paper!
01:34:41.259,01:34:43.678,Roxie Hart is free! She's free!
01:35:01.321,01:35:02.530,Come on! Move it!
01:35:02.614,01:35:04.574,"First she shoots the husband, then she plugs the lawyer."
01:35:09.120,01:35:10.121,Hey!
01:35:10.205,01:35:12.373,Hey! Don't you want to take my picture?
01:35:13.041,01:35:15.960,Hey! I'm the famous Roxie Hart.
01:35:17.378,01:35:18.906,"Hey, what happened?"
01:35:19.214,01:35:20.715,"Billy, what the hell happened?"
01:35:21.716,01:35:22.967,"This is Chicago, kid."
01:35:23.051,01:35:24.636,You can't beat fresh blood on the walls.
01:35:24.719,01:35:27.347,"But my publicity, Billy. My name in the papers."
01:35:27.430,01:35:30.475,"-I was counting on that. -Your gratitude is overwhelming, kid."
01:35:30.558,01:35:33.269,"-I just saved your life. -Yeah, and you got $5,000."
01:35:33.353,01:35:35.271,And what do I get? I get nothing?
01:35:35.355,01:35:37.857,"Five? Actually, it's ten once I collect from Velma."
01:35:38.399,01:35:39.442,I get nothing?
01:35:40.276,01:35:41.903,Don't forget your blessed diary.
01:35:42.737,01:35:46.532,Hope you don't mind. I added a few erroneous phrases in there.
01:35:49.827,01:35:51.246,Sorry I couldn't tell you.
01:35:51.371,01:35:52.789,Couldn't take a chance.
01:35:54.457,01:35:55.833,I never lost a case.
01:35:59.295,01:36:01.839,"You're a free woman, Roxie Hart."
01:36:03.883,01:36:05.677,And God save Illinois.
01:36:19.190,01:36:20.483,What do you want?
01:36:21.985,01:36:23.444,I want you to come home.
01:36:24.946,01:36:26.698,You said you still wanted to.
01:36:27.490,01:36:28.616,And the baby.
01:36:28.700,01:36:30.118,Baby? What baby?
01:36:36.249,01:36:37.792,What do you take me for?
01:36:38.835,01:36:40.545,There ain't no baby.
01:36:42.422,01:36:43.798,There ain't no baby?
01:36:49.137,01:36:51.180,They didn't even want my picture.
01:36:52.390,01:36:55.268,I just… I can't understand that.
01:37:02.275,01:37:04.485,Why didn't they even want my picture?
01:37:34.557,01:37:37.268,Miss Roxie Hart says Good night.
01:38:55.763,01:38:57.723,Didn't she kill a guy a while back?
01:38:57.807,01:38:59.934,"Eh, who can keep them straight anymore?"
01:39:12.738,01:39:17.869,"-We'll be in touch. -I'm not quite finished yet. I have… Wait, wait, wait. One more."
01:39:17.952,01:39:22.915,"Um, I could… Just a second. I'm not… Goddamnit!"
01:39:25.460,01:39:26.919,Thank you!
01:39:27.545,01:39:28.838,"Here's the music, hon."
01:39:36.304,01:39:37.555,Thanks.
01:39:46.189,01:39:47.690,Goddamnit.
01:39:47.773,01:39:49.525,"You know, you're really pretty good."
01:39:52.278,01:39:53.946,"Yeah, that and a dime."
01:39:55.865,01:39:57.200,What are you doing here?
01:39:57.992,01:40:00.703,I heard you been making the rounds.
01:40:00.912,01:40:03.289,"Yeah, well, if it was up to you, I'd be swinging by now."
01:40:03.372,01:40:05.208,"Come on, I always knew Billy would get you off."
01:40:05.416,01:40:07.460,You should learn how to put things behind you.
01:40:07.543,01:40:10.004,Thank you. I'll put that at the top of my list.
01:40:10.087,01:40:12.798,Right after finding a job and an apartment with a john.
01:40:12.965,01:40:16.385,-Just shut up and listen to me! -You really are something.
01:40:16.469,01:40:19.680,Coming in here like some goddamn queen bee.
01:40:19.805,01:40:22.725,All full of advice for a poor slob like me.
01:40:23.226,01:40:26.020,"Let me tell you something, Miss Velma Kelly."
01:40:26.103,01:40:27.939,I got a new life now.
01:40:28.022,01:40:31.150,And one of the best things about it is it don't include you.
01:40:31.234,01:40:33.194,Fine. I just thought we could help each other out.
01:40:33.277,01:40:36.072,"-You thought wrong, didn't you? -Listen to me."
01:40:36.948,01:40:39.242,"Look, I talked to this guy downtown."
01:40:39.325,01:40:41.744,He said one jazz killer is nothing these days.
01:40:41.827,01:40:54.215,But two… We could make a couple of hundred a week.
01:40:55.049,01:40:56.342,"Think about it, Roxie."
01:40:56.425,01:40:59.554,Our faces back in the papers. Our names on the marquee.
01:40:59.637,01:41:01.847,Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart.
01:41:03.015,01:41:04.559,Shouldn't it be alphabetical?
01:41:05.142,01:41:06.519,That could work.
01:41:06.602,01:41:09.897,Couple hundred? Maybe we could ask for a thou.
01:41:09.981,01:41:11.232,We're worth it.
01:41:13.901,01:41:14.944,Forget it.
01:41:15.278,01:41:16.612,It'll never work.
01:41:17.780,01:41:19.574,-Why not? -'Cause I hate you.
01:41:20.616,01:41:24.120,There's only one business in the world where that's no problem at all.
01:41:36.173,01:41:38.009,is proud to announce a first.
01:41:38.634,01:41:42.722,The first time anywhere there's been an act of this nature.
01:41:42.805,01:41:45.891,Not only one little lady. But two.
01:41:45.975,01:41:47.893,You've read about them in the papers.
01:41:47.977,01:41:49.604,And now here they are.
01:41:49.687,01:41:53.899,Chicago's own killer-dillers. Those scintillating sinners.
01:41:54.150,01:41:56.819,Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly!
01:42:57.254,01:42:59.882,"Let's make the parties longer, let's make the skirts shorter."
01:42:59.965,01:43:02.927,Let's all go to hell in a fast car and keep it hot!
01:44:57.082,01:44:58.250,Yeah!
01:45:00.211,01:45:03.422,"Me and Roxie, we'd just like to say thank you!"
01:45:04.548,01:45:05.674,Thank you!
01:45:06.258,01:45:10.971,"Believe us, we could not have done it without you!"
