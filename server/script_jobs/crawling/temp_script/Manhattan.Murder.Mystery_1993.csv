00:02:03.248,00:02:06.251,"MAN: Oh, no. Oh-- CROWD: Oh!"
00:02:06.251,00:02:15.552,"Come on, you promised to sit through the entire hockey game without being bored, and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you next week."
00:02:15.552,00:02:18.597,With your eyesight I'm surprised you can see the puck.
00:02:18.597,00:02:21.016,Yay. All right!
00:02:24.770,00:02:28.482,"LARRY: God, I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out."
00:02:28.482,00:02:31.068,There's a Bob Hope movie on television later.
00:02:31.068,00:02:33.946,I know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana?
00:02:33.946,00:02:36.865,"Killed 12 victims, dismembered them, and ate them."
00:02:36.865,00:02:39.118,Really?
00:02:39.118,00:02:40.494,Yeah. I'll say.
00:02:47.793,00:02:50.629,PAUL: Hold the elevator!
00:02:50.629,00:02:54.215,PAUL: Hold the elevator.
00:02:54.215,00:02:56.010,Oh!
00:02:56.010,00:02:58.595,I see you at the gym sometimes.
00:02:58.595,00:03:01.015,"Oh, you do?"
00:02:58.595,00:03:02.683,Yeah we live in the apartment down the hall.
00:03:01.015,00:03:04.559,"Oh, well I go whenever I have the discipline."
00:03:04.559,00:03:07.062,It's important to put time in. Does wonders.
00:03:07.062,00:03:09.523,"Oh, yeah, I agree."
00:03:09.523,00:03:12.526,I prefer to atrophy.
00:03:12.526,00:03:14.402,We bought a treadmill last week.
00:03:14.402,00:03:18.406,"Well, we had one, but we got rid of it because it was taking up space."
00:03:18.406,00:03:22.327,Especially as you have to turn it on and get on it once in a while.
00:03:22.327,00:03:24.913,It's so confusing with those buttons and programs.
00:03:24.913,00:03:26.373,I'm never going to get that.
00:03:26.373,00:03:29.084,LILLIAN: It was so wonderful meeting you...
00:03:29.084,00:03:30.377,"Well, yeah."
00:03:32.379,00:03:35.090,Anyway. Good night.
00:03:35.090,00:03:36.967,Such a lovely couple.
00:03:36.967,00:03:39.178,"Oh, say-- Hello?"
00:03:39.178,00:03:44.516,"Listen, why don't you come in for a second and have a drink with us?"
00:03:44.516,00:03:45.726,"Oh, well, that'd be fine."
00:03:45.726,00:03:47.769,PAUL: She makes great Irish coffee.
00:03:47.769,00:03:52.066,There's a movie on television I want to watch-- LILLIAN: Give me a treadmill lesson.
00:03:52.066,00:03:55.443,"CAROL: If I can figure it out, then believe me, anybody can."
00:03:58.238,00:03:59.865,I don't know what I'm doing.
00:03:59.865,00:04:02.910,Let's look at this wonderful book they've given me.
00:04:02.910,00:04:04.995,"Now, I'm at level five."
00:04:04.995,00:04:07.706,You're that advanced?
00:04:07.706,00:04:10.084,I work out all the time.
00:04:10.084,00:04:12.211,I can't understand this even.
00:04:12.211,00:04:13.921,"Yeah, well. See this?"
00:04:13.921,00:04:17.216,"Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail."
00:04:17.216,00:04:21.011,Very rare and very beautiful.
00:04:21.011,00:04:25.849,And this plate block is quite unique because it has a flaw in the engraving.
00:04:25.849,00:04:27.392,See if you can see it.
00:04:27.392,00:04:29.978,It's hard for me.
00:04:29.978,00:04:32.439,Interesting? Yeah.
00:04:32.439,00:04:34.649,"That makes it quite valuable, you see."
00:04:34.649,00:04:39.196,I just got a commemorative set of issues that are gonna be quite valuable.
00:04:39.196,00:04:42.032,Look at the color.
00:04:39.196,00:04:45.119,These are gonna become real-- We're probably keeping you up.
00:04:45.119,00:04:47.829,I think I should be going.
00:04:47.829,00:04:50.290,Me? I'm in book publishing.
00:04:50.290,00:04:53.252,Are you? I own an old cinema.
00:04:53.252,00:04:58.381,"Used to have a string of three, but business is not what it used to be."
00:04:58.381,00:05:01.218,"Look at the color, the perforations are still intact."
00:05:01.218,00:05:03.220,Where's Carol?
00:05:03.220,00:05:04.638,"Oh, really?"
00:05:04.638,00:05:05.973,Coffee's ready.
00:05:04.638,00:05:07.515,"Coffee, I forgot coffee..."
00:05:07.515,00:05:09.977,PAUL: We can get back to this later. Come on in.
00:05:09.977,00:05:14.189,We never had any children but it's easy to empathize.
00:05:14.189,00:05:16.399,What college does your son attend?
00:05:16.399,00:05:17.901,Brown.
00:05:17.901,00:05:20.612,Nice color.
00:05:20.612,00:05:23.448,Paul never attended college.
00:05:23.448,00:05:25.659,Always regretted it.
00:05:23.448,00:05:27.661,I think knowledge is the second most important thing.
00:05:27.661,00:05:29.997,First is health.
00:05:29.997,00:05:33.792,It's amazing how time just-- And do you work?
00:05:33.792,00:05:35.627,Do I?
00:05:35.627,00:05:41.091,"Well actually I used to work at an ad agency, but that was many years ago."
00:05:41.091,00:05:44.886,But I've been seriously thinking of starting a little restaurant.
00:05:44.886,00:05:47.889,Really?
00:05:44.886,00:05:50.349,"Yeah, but Larry is trying to talk me out of it."
00:05:50.349,00:05:58.192,Her duck and fennel omelet on scallops in hollandaise sauce with truffles and sweetbreads will make you snap into fetal position screaming for a month.
00:05:58.192,00:06:01.695,"He loves to tease me but actually, he loves exotic food."
00:06:01.695,00:06:06.241,My weakness is any rich dessert.
00:06:06.241,00:06:09.328,I'll fix a dessert that'll make your eyes roll.
00:06:09.328,00:06:12.080,You'll have to exercise a month to work it off.
00:06:12.080,00:06:14.624,PAUL: We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.
00:06:14.624,00:06:17.127,CAROL: Really?
00:06:17.127,00:06:19.754,What do you buy the woman who buys everything?
00:06:19.754,00:06:21.756,We already have twin cemetery plots.
00:06:21.756,00:06:25.135,"Well, I always think a Bentley is in good taste."
00:06:25.135,00:06:29.556,"On our 20th, I got her some lovely handkerchiefs."
00:06:29.556,00:06:33.227,They had my initials on them.
00:06:33.227,00:06:35.187,And I didn't even know her size.
00:06:39.524,00:06:43.904,"LARRY: Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going longer?"
00:06:43.904,00:06:47.615,I was signaling you.
00:06:47.615,00:06:51.494,Neighborly? If this guy showed me his stamps one more time...
00:06:51.494,00:06:55.082,My favorite thing is to look at canceled postage.
00:06:55.082,00:06:57.292,"CAROL: Come on, Larry, it was sweet."
00:06:57.292,00:06:59.920,They're looking forward to their anniversary.
00:06:59.920,00:07:02.630,And I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.
00:07:02.630,00:07:04.883,I don't know why they put it on so late.
00:07:04.883,00:07:07.177,Do you think that's gonna happen to us?
00:07:07.177,00:07:09.679,LARRY: What?
00:07:09.679,00:07:15.310,"Just another dull, aging couple with our walks-- LARRY: We are a dull, aging couple."
00:07:15.310,00:07:18.772,"--our TV, our lox and bagels, and our twin cemetery plots?"
00:07:18.772,00:07:22.650,"We should be as lucky as them, to be in their shape at their age."
00:07:22.650,00:07:25.862,They look great. Did you see the dumbbells this guy lifts?
00:07:25.862,00:07:30.450,If I lifted dumbbells like that I'd get a hernia the size of the San Andreas Fault.
00:07:30.450,00:07:32.660,How often do you think they make love?
00:07:32.660,00:07:34.246,"LARRY: Oh, you know."
00:07:34.246,00:07:36.415,"Probably more than we do, in their shape."
00:07:36.415,00:07:38.750,I'm sure as much as once a week.
00:07:38.750,00:07:40.585,Larry?
00:07:40.585,00:07:42.712,"LARRY: God, I'm exhausted. What?"
00:07:42.712,00:07:45.048,Do you still find me attractive?
00:07:45.048,00:07:47.759,LARRY: Of course.
00:07:47.759,00:07:50.137,Of course I do.
00:07:47.759,00:07:52.055,CAROL: We're not turning into a pair of comfortable old shoes are we?
00:07:52.055,00:07:53.473,Never comfortable.
00:07:53.473,00:07:55.558,I don't think you have to worry about that.
00:07:57.602,00:07:59.729,LARRY: How you guys doing?
00:07:59.729,00:08:02.523,We're gonna get this one.
00:08:02.523,00:08:04.525,Are we gonna see you at Elaine's Thursday?
00:08:04.525,00:08:07.070,"CAROL: No, Thursday's our Wagner opera."
00:08:07.070,00:08:10.531,Ted's coming to Elaine's.
00:08:10.531,00:08:13.743,He seems to be doing well...
00:08:13.743,00:08:18.415,"Come on, he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it."
00:08:18.415,00:08:20.875,I think he looks like he's glad.
00:08:20.875,00:08:23.128,So what you want to do?
00:08:23.128,00:08:25.839,We're going to a movie.
00:08:23.128,00:08:28.633,We're gonna see Double Indemnity Why don't you come with us.
00:08:28.633,00:08:31.928,I'd have the police after her so fast it'd make her head spin.
00:08:31.928,00:08:33.680,They'd put her through the wringer.
00:08:33.680,00:08:36.391,"And brother, the things they would squeeze out."
00:08:36.391,00:08:38.477,They haven't got a single thing to go on.
00:08:38.477,00:08:40.979,Not too much.
00:08:38.477,00:08:44.483,"Just 26 years' experience, all the percentage there is and this hunk of concrete in my stomach."
00:08:44.483,00:08:47.277,"CAROL: God, that movie was great, wasn't it?"
00:08:47.277,00:08:49.821,I loved it.
00:08:49.821,00:08:52.866,It was all so wonderful.
00:08:52.866,00:08:54.701,There must be somebody in your office.
00:08:54.701,00:08:56.119,Ted?
00:08:56.119,00:08:58.705,I always thought Ted had a crush on you.
00:08:58.705,00:09:01.458,Me? Please.
00:09:01.458,00:09:04.503,"CAROL: I mean, I adore him, but he's like a girlfriend."
00:09:04.503,00:09:06.505,"LARRY: Now he's divorced, you know?"
00:09:06.505,00:09:09.049,Do I detect a note of jealousy?
00:09:09.049,00:09:11.134,JACK: I had to come up here and call 911.
00:09:11.134,00:09:12.802,WOMAN: So what's the trouble?
00:09:12.802,00:09:15.596,MAN: Is that the EMS?
00:09:15.596,00:09:17.724,She had a heart attack.
00:09:17.724,00:09:19.600,"CAROL: Oh, my God."
00:09:19.600,00:09:21.311,LARRY &amp; CAROL: She's dead?
00:09:21.311,00:09:23.938,JACK: They're giving Mr. House a sedative right now.
00:09:23.938,00:09:26.566,CAROL: She was the picture of health...
00:09:26.566,00:09:31.321,"I called EMS, they got here as soon as they could but it was too late."
00:09:31.321,00:09:33.740,"JACK: Awful, just awful."
00:09:33.740,00:09:36.617,It was a classic coronary.
00:09:36.617,00:09:38.870,"Oh, boy."
00:09:38.870,00:09:41.706,DOCTOR: You can be good neighbors.
00:09:41.706,00:09:45.419,The first time we saw them was last night. We just met them.
00:09:45.419,00:09:48.171,They invited us in for coffee.
00:09:48.171,00:09:49.548,Sweet person.
00:09:51.383,00:09:53.593,"God, okay."
00:09:53.593,00:09:56.012,"Oh, hello."
00:09:56.012,00:09:59.140,"Hi, Mr. House. So sorry."
00:09:59.140,00:10:01.351,It was quite nice of you.
00:10:01.351,00:10:03.478,lf there's anything we can do...
00:10:01.351,00:10:05.313,"Anything, Anything at all, I mean, God."
00:10:05.313,00:10:08.191,It's just such a shock.
00:10:08.191,00:10:10.569,"I mean, she seemed so healthy."
00:10:10.569,00:10:12.695,She had a heart condition.
00:10:12.695,00:10:14.655,She did?
00:10:14.655,00:10:17.492,"Well, she wouldn't have."
00:10:17.492,00:10:19.869,If there's anything we can do.
00:10:19.869,00:10:23.290,"If you're lonely, come by."
00:10:23.290,00:10:25.417,You owe me a French dessert.
00:10:25.417,00:10:27.544,"Oh, no, I haven't forgotten."
00:10:27.544,00:10:29.921,Well have a nice time.
00:10:29.921,00:10:31.298,We're going to the opera.
00:10:31.298,00:10:32.591,Enjoy.
00:10:32.591,00:10:34.759,"Good night, good night."
00:10:35.843,00:10:37.887,"Come, we're gonna be late."
00:10:45.562,00:10:50.442,"CAROL: The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you watch the whole opera."
00:10:50.442,00:10:52.902,LARRY: I can't listen to that much Wagner.
00:10:52.902,00:10:55.155,I start to get the urge to conquer Poland.
00:10:57.824,00:10:59.659,"SY: I tell you, I think it's weird."
00:10:59.659,00:11:04.164,"One night she's having coffee, and the next night they're carrying her out in a bag?"
00:11:04.164,00:11:07.292,CAROL: I know. And she did not look like she was ready to go.
00:11:07.292,00:11:10.337,Maybe he killed her.
00:11:10.337,00:11:12.797,"No, not this guy."
00:11:12.797,00:11:19.554,He gets his jollies from licking the backs of stamps I can see that. Depending on who is on the stamp.
00:11:19.554,00:11:23.350,She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.
00:11:23.350,00:11:25.268,Well what is she gonna say?
00:11:25.268,00:11:27.979,"Hello, I'm Mrs. House and I have a bad heart."
00:11:27.979,00:11:31.232,She had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy.
00:11:31.232,00:11:34.986,It's easier to talk about a hysterectomy than a heart condition.
00:11:34.986,00:11:37.780,TED: She liked desserts.
00:11:37.780,00:11:39.574,So she had one too many.
00:11:39.574,00:11:42.619,No! She wasn't on a diet.
00:11:42.619,00:11:45.997,So she wasn't on a diet.
00:11:42.619,00:11:47.582,TED: This could be a great way to kill somebody.
00:11:47.582,00:11:54.255,"You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate mousse, butter."
00:11:54.255,00:11:56.633,They go like that.
00:11:56.633,00:11:59.260,"It's disgusting, but I love it."
00:11:59.260,00:12:02.305,Wouldn't that be great?
00:11:59.260,00:12:05.600,"I'd like to French pastry myself to death, I really would."
00:12:05.600,00:12:07.644,"I'd like another piece of pie, after this."
00:12:07.644,00:12:11.022,Are you gonna start a restaurant? Are you serious?
00:12:11.022,00:12:13.816,MARILYN: You're a great cook.
00:12:13.816,00:12:15.985,I want to be part of it.
00:12:15.985,00:12:17.736,SY: Really?
00:12:17.736,00:12:20.198,No. I don't know.
00:12:20.198,00:12:22.116,"TED: Yeah! Oh, God, it'd be wonderful."
00:12:22.116,00:12:23.868,What are you encouraging her for?
00:12:23.868,00:12:26.204,She's a great cook.
00:12:26.204,00:12:28.248,"Thanks to you, actually."
00:12:26.204,00:12:29.916,"It was his idea, the cooking lessons, so, I mean..."
00:12:29.916,00:12:35.338,SY: But a restaurant is serious business you can't take that lightly.
00:12:35.338,00:12:37.465,"I'm not being cavalier about it, Sy."
00:12:37.465,00:12:40.594,LARRY: It's time-consuming. You have to be there every night...
00:12:40.594,00:12:43.096,TED: Wait. Look.
00:12:43.096,00:12:44.931,CAROL: It's what I do.
00:12:44.931,00:12:47.183,She's great.
00:12:47.183,00:12:53.440,"She'll be cooking in the kitchen, I'll be at the front running the joint like Rick in Casablanca."
00:12:53.440,00:12:55.774,I'm serious.
00:12:53.440,00:12:58.236,"Not like a hobby, I'd be serious."
00:12:58.236,00:13:02.031,LARRY: I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin.
00:13:02.031,00:13:06.620,Then I figured they would just get into an argument over penis envy or something.
00:13:06.620,00:13:08.913,The poor guy suffers from it so.
00:13:08.913,00:13:11.790,Didn't he seem a little too cheerful?
00:13:11.790,00:13:14.085,He seemed like his regular self to me.
00:13:14.085,00:13:19.048,"But when you brought up the notion of the restaurant, the guy lit up like Mr. Glo Worm."
00:13:19.048,00:13:21.008,The restaurant?
00:13:21.008,00:13:24.596,He sees himself as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.
00:13:24.596,00:13:27.766,"I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing his hands."
00:13:27.766,00:13:29.309,"No, I mean, Mr. House."
00:13:29.309,00:13:31.810,Didn't he seem a little too cheerful to you?
00:13:31.810,00:13:33.980,LARRY: Mr. House?
00:13:33.980,00:13:36.441,"Yes, I mean, there's..."
00:13:33.980,00:13:39.569,"Well, you know, he seemed too composed for a man whose wife just died."
00:13:39.569,00:13:42.155,"LARRY: Well, Jesus."
00:13:42.155,00:13:44.699,Walk down the street sobbing?
00:13:42.155,00:13:49.078,"I don't know, all I know is they were supposedly looking forward to their anniversary, and..."
00:13:49.078,00:13:55.084,"If I suddenly dropped dead, wouldn't you sob for months or years if I-- Don't make those kinds of jokes."
00:13:55.084,00:13:57.128,I don't like those remarks.
00:13:55.084,00:13:59.380,"Meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a physical checkup."
00:13:59.380,00:14:01.675,"Well, I don't know."
00:13:59.380,00:14:04.302,To me he seemed a little too perky.
00:14:04.302,00:14:09.015,"Suddenly, he wants his French desserts and, Have a nice time at the opera."
00:14:09.015,00:14:11.518,"And, My god, we're certainly dressed up."
00:14:11.518,00:14:14.979,This guy should be a wreck.
00:14:14.979,00:14:19.609,"Meanwhile, I can't get The Flying Dutchman theme out of my mind."
00:14:19.609,00:14:23.863,Remind me tomorrow to buy all the Wagner records in town and rent a chain saw.
00:14:27.283,00:14:29.577,CAROL: Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.
00:14:29.577,00:14:31.621,LARRY: Yeah?
00:14:31.621,00:14:33.164,LARRY: He's a little mousy too.
00:14:33.164,00:14:35.583,They can have rodent time and eat cheese together.
00:14:37.001,00:14:39.212,"LARRY: Oh, Christ."
00:14:40.296,00:14:42.674,Hello?
00:14:42.674,00:14:44.175,Yes.
00:14:44.175,00:14:46.720,"Yes, yes, of course, you woke us."
00:14:46.720,00:14:51.599,Not everybody is up at 1:00 in the morning watching the porn channel.
00:14:51.599,00:14:53.226,I'll put her on.
00:14:53.226,00:14:54.769,Ted. For you.
00:14:54.769,00:14:56.855,"Ted, hi."
00:14:56.855,00:15:00.608,"I figured out how he killed her, made it look like a coronary."
00:15:00.608,00:15:06.573,"He gagged her and tied her to the treadmill, and then turned the exercise program up to Olympic levels."
00:15:08.825,00:15:10.702,"No, no."
00:15:10.702,00:15:14.080,"You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too perky."
00:15:14.080,00:15:16.624,You know?
00:15:14.080,00:15:20.837,"I mean, he's not acting like a man whose beloved of 28 years died a few days ago."
00:15:20.837,00:15:23.590,Are you onto that?
00:15:23.590,00:15:25.383,"Yeah, I know..."
00:15:25.383,00:15:28.010,"What? Oh, here."
00:15:28.010,00:15:31.890,"Listen, she was not murdered."
00:15:31.890,00:15:35.476,"It was a coronary, there was a doctor there, an old man..."
00:15:35.476,00:15:37.228,How do you know he's a real doctor?
00:15:37.228,00:15:40.815,I'm not gonna touch that.
00:15:40.815,00:15:43.276,W-Wait a minute.
00:15:43.276,00:15:45.653,I called about something else.
00:15:45.653,00:15:49.657,"Listen, I know a great location for a restaurant."
00:15:52.201,00:15:54.537,LARRY: Look at this.
00:15:54.537,00:15:57.540,"CAROL: Well, it's dark."
00:15:57.540,00:15:59.626,Like you go through a cave.
00:15:59.626,00:16:02.378,Then you come out to this.
00:16:02.378,00:16:04.130,It's really so beautiful.
00:16:04.130,00:16:06.048,Isn't it great?
00:16:04.130,00:16:07.801,"But, it's kind of out of the way for a restaurant."
00:16:07.801,00:16:09.427,No. That's the appeal.
00:16:09.427,00:16:13.222,"Because it's so romantic, tucked away back here like this."
00:16:13.222,00:16:14.933,You don't want street trade.
00:16:14.933,00:16:18.728,You want a little spot people hear about and lovers go to.
00:16:18.728,00:16:20.855,"It takes months to get a reservation, you know?"
00:16:20.855,00:16:22.774,CAROL: You really thought this out.
00:16:22.774,00:16:26.026,LARRY: I used to come here with Julie when we were married.
00:16:26.026,00:16:29.029,Used to walk around here.
00:16:29.029,00:16:31.282,It's gorgeous at night.
00:16:31.282,00:16:34.243,"I'd think, Why are we here?"
00:16:34.243,00:16:36.913,It made the moment doubly poignant.
00:16:39.206,00:16:41.626,"PAUL: Hi-- Oh, my."
00:16:41.626,00:16:44.671,These are my floating islands.
00:16:44.671,00:16:47.173,I'd love it. Come on in.
00:16:47.173,00:16:49.133,This is unbelievable.
00:16:49.133,00:16:50.844,Did you do this?
00:16:50.844,00:16:52.428,I told you.
00:16:52.428,00:16:55.097,"Anyway, this is vanilla sauce."
00:16:55.097,00:16:57.892,I put chocolate truffles...
00:16:57.892,00:17:00.311,She made these for you.
00:17:00.311,00:17:02.897,I'll make some coffee.
00:17:02.897,00:17:04.691,Let me make it.
00:17:04.691,00:17:07.527,I insist. Sit down.
00:17:07.527,00:17:10.864,Aren't you nice.
00:17:10.864,00:17:12.323,LARRY: How're you holding up?
00:17:12.323,00:17:14.742,"PAUL: Oh, I don't know."
00:17:12.323,00:17:18.204,"I was thinking after a while, I'd get away."
00:17:18.204,00:17:20.498,"You have someone to go with, or...?"
00:17:20.498,00:17:22.291,I have a brother in Florida.
00:17:22.291,00:17:24.752,I'm hoping he can get away.
00:17:22.291,00:17:26.713,Good idea-- Do you like snorkeling?
00:17:24.752,00:17:29.382,"Snorkeling? No, I get nervous when brightly colored fish stare at me."
00:17:29.382,00:17:31.425,I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.
00:17:31.425,00:17:33.386,"LARRY: Oh, stamps? Well."
00:17:33.386,00:17:34.762,PAUL: Look at these.
00:17:40.018,00:17:44.022,Tsk. Coffee.
00:17:51.111,00:17:53.489,Hmm...
00:18:20.934,00:18:23.644,This is really delicious.
00:18:23.644,00:18:25.521,Well thanks very much.
00:18:25.521,00:18:27.732,Mm. Uh...
00:18:27.732,00:18:29.567,Was it a large funeral?
00:18:29.567,00:18:32.236,"Oh, no. We had very few friends. No family."
00:18:32.236,00:18:34.739,Right.
00:18:34.739,00:18:37.075,"Well, they're the best, aren't they?"
00:18:37.075,00:18:38.492,PAUL: Yeah.
00:18:38.492,00:18:40.828,"Anyway, then you're laid to rest and..."
00:18:40.828,00:18:42.705,"You know, I was just..."
00:18:42.705,00:18:46.542,Where are the twin cemetery plots?
00:18:46.542,00:18:49.378,We were thinking that that was just such a romantic idea.
00:18:49.378,00:18:51.505,"Weren't we, Larry?"
00:18:51.505,00:18:57.011,Remember when we were talking about the twin cemetery plots and how romantic that is?
00:18:57.011,00:18:58.262,Remember?
00:18:58.262,00:18:59.889,Yes!
00:18:59.889,00:19:02.475,Spending eternity with the beloved.
00:19:02.475,00:19:04.477,"I sound like one of those guys, now."
00:19:04.477,00:19:06.646,Yes.
00:19:04.477,00:19:09.315,"CAROL: Yeah, I was just wondering, um, where is the cemetery?"
00:19:09.315,00:19:12.192,"Oh, it's in Nyack."
00:19:12.192,00:19:14.695,We used to summer there occasionally.
00:19:16.405,00:19:21.577,LARRY: What was all that about twin cemetery plots?
00:19:21.577,00:19:25.706,"I knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked up on it quickly."
00:19:25.706,00:19:28.208,I was in the kitchen making the coffee.
00:19:28.208,00:19:32.212,"There were no beans, so I was looking in his cupboards, just to see."
00:19:32.212,00:19:34.590,"And I came across this urn, okay?"
00:19:34.590,00:19:37.510,And I opened it and there were ashes in it.
00:19:37.510,00:19:39.804,Ashes? Funeral ashes?
00:19:39.804,00:19:41.639,"CAROL: Larry, he had her cremated!"
00:19:41.639,00:19:44.600,How did you know it was her?
00:19:44.600,00:19:46.435,Did they resemble Mrs. House?
00:19:46.435,00:19:48.395,CAROL: Who else would it be?
00:19:48.395,00:19:52.025,"Could be an associate, relative."
00:19:52.025,00:19:54.276,"CAROL: Right. Hidden, huh?"
00:19:54.276,00:19:57.071,What do you mean?
00:19:57.071,00:20:01.200,"Larry, all I know is, he lied."
00:20:01.200,00:20:03.661,"LARRY: Look, maybe he's embarrassed."
00:20:03.661,00:20:10.334,"Maybe he didn't want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he told us that. You know, what's the difference?"
00:20:11.293,00:20:13.379,Who are you calling?
00:20:13.379,00:20:15.381,"Oh, Jesus."
00:20:15.381,00:20:19.760,Leave the guy alone.
00:20:19.760,00:20:22.221,He wants to go on a vacation or something.
00:20:22.221,00:20:24.431,CAROL: Yeah? Where?
00:20:24.431,00:20:27.476,"Snorkeling, right?"
00:20:27.476,00:20:32.648,He has fun sitting at the bottom of the water face-to-face with squid.
00:20:32.648,00:20:34.316,I know. What about this?
00:20:34.316,00:20:37.444,"What if they had a big insurance policy, or something like that?"
00:20:37.444,00:20:39.446,Too much Double Indemnity.
00:20:39.446,00:20:42.449,Hi! Yeah.
00:20:42.449,00:20:46.120,"Listen, we were just in our neighbor's apartment, right?"
00:20:46.120,00:20:49.957,"Yeah, and get this. I came across an urn with ashes in it."
00:20:49.957,00:20:53.460,"Only, he says he had his wife buried."
00:20:53.460,00:20:57.381,That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy.
00:20:57.381,00:21:00.259,"You don't want something discovered, like poison."
00:21:00.259,00:21:02.595,Mm. Right.
00:21:02.595,00:21:04.764,"They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they?"
00:21:04.764,00:21:08.559,"I don't know, there are a lot of different kinds of exotic poisons."
00:21:08.559,00:21:10.895,"Yeah, but why would he be lying?"
00:21:10.895,00:21:12.396,"I mean, why would he lie at all?"
00:21:12.396,00:21:14.232,"Jesus, you're up to poisons already."
00:21:14.232,00:21:16.358,You guys are slipping into a mad obsession.
00:21:16.358,00:21:18.236,Would you do that?
00:21:16.358,00:21:20.738,"That'd be great, 'cause you know I'm not good at that kind of thing."
00:21:20.738,00:21:23.490,"All right. Okay. I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye."
00:21:23.490,00:21:25.034,Pfft.
00:21:25.034,00:21:27.327,Could we go to bed now?
00:21:27.327,00:21:29.038,"What do you mean, you're not tired?"
00:21:29.038,00:21:31.540,Ted's gonna check with the funeral home tomorrow.
00:21:31.540,00:21:34.418,I don't understand why you're not fascinated with this.
00:21:34.418,00:21:36.545,We could be living next door to a murderer.
00:21:36.545,00:21:39.465,New York's a melting pot.
00:22:23.592,00:22:25.427,"Oh, my God."
00:22:25.427,00:22:27.471,"LARRY: Hey, are you okay?"
00:22:27.471,00:22:29.015,Larry.
00:22:29.015,00:22:30.724,"Larry, I heard a noise."
00:22:30.724,00:22:37.106,"I heard a noise in the hallway, so I looked, and I think-- I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator."
00:22:37.106,00:22:40.026,"Yeah, I'm almost certain that it was him."
00:22:40.026,00:22:41.777,Jesus. So what?
00:22:41.777,00:22:44.989,"So what, it's not a crime."
00:22:44.989,00:22:46.782,"Who would be, at 1:30 am?"
00:22:46.782,00:22:49.327,I was in a deep sleep.
00:22:49.327,00:22:52.330,You know how we complain about living on the geriatric floor?
00:22:52.330,00:22:54.414,That joke?
00:22:54.414,00:22:56.667,He got on the elevator.
00:22:56.667,00:22:58.961,"The guy pays rent, he's entitled."
00:22:58.961,00:23:02.464,Can you go back to bed?
00:23:02.464,00:23:04.342,You woke me out of a deep sleep.
00:23:04.342,00:23:07.427,I gotta get up early tomorrow-- I know what I'm gonna do.
00:23:07.427,00:23:09.138,I'm gonna ring him up.
00:23:09.138,00:23:11.515,"I'm gonna ring his apartment, see if he's home."
00:23:11.515,00:23:14.560,You're gonna ring him? Now?
00:23:14.560,00:23:16.354,Don't ring-- What are you doing?
00:23:16.354,00:23:19.106,"Larry, don't."
00:23:19.106,00:23:21.567,He's a widower.
00:23:21.567,00:23:23.694,You're crazy. Stop it!
00:23:23.694,00:23:25.946,So you saw him go out.
00:23:25.946,00:23:27.656,"We're too late, he's not there yet."
00:23:27.656,00:23:29.283,Give me this.
00:23:29.283,00:23:31.911,"If you want to find out who left, call downstairs."
00:23:31.911,00:23:33.913,"I'll call, but just keep ringing."
00:23:33.913,00:23:36.498,"Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing, you got it."
00:23:36.498,00:23:38.876,LARRY: This is insane.
00:23:38.876,00:23:41.795,What is he doing?
00:23:41.795,00:23:45.091,LARRY: It's not your business.
00:23:45.091,00:23:49.262,"Hello? Yes, hello."
00:23:49.262,00:23:52.390,Did anybody just leave the building? I'm just...
00:23:52.390,00:23:54.808,You're sure?
00:23:54.808,00:23:58.562,"No, okay. All right."
00:23:58.562,00:24:00.773,Okay. Are you happy?
00:24:00.773,00:24:02.858,I don't get it. No.
00:24:02.858,00:24:07.487,"For crying out loud, you're making a mystery where nothing exists."
00:24:07.487,00:24:11.575,"I know it. No, wait."
00:24:13.327,00:24:17.831,"He got on the elevator-- You know-- No, wait. Listen to this I'm gonna go to sleep."
00:24:17.831,00:24:20.709,I don't want to standing here in the middle of the night.
00:24:20.709,00:24:23.212,He got on the elevator and took it to the basement.
00:24:23.212,00:24:25.839,Great. So what?
00:24:25.839,00:24:28.466,He has a car and the garage door key.
00:24:28.466,00:24:30.386,So what?
00:24:28.466,00:24:33.431,He opened-- So what? What's the big deal?
00:24:33.431,00:24:36.516,So the next-door neighbor went out and took his car someplace.
00:24:36.516,00:24:38.269,All right.
00:24:38.269,00:24:40.980,"I mean, I'm right."
00:24:40.980,00:24:43.523,This kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet.
00:24:43.523,00:24:45.234,"So you're right, you're suspicious."
00:24:45.234,00:24:47.403,It says more about your mind than about him.
00:24:47.403,00:24:49.405,What about your rigidity?
00:24:49.405,00:24:52.283,Get into bed. You're so-- What's wrong with you? Jesus.
00:25:05.503,00:25:07.340,Hi.
00:25:16.265,00:25:19.517,Jack? Do you think you could come upstairs today?
00:25:19.517,00:25:21.979,'Cause I got a leak in the kitchen.
00:25:21.979,00:25:23.147,"Well, yeah. Sure."
00:25:23.147,00:25:25.024,But it will be this afternoon?
00:25:25.024,00:25:26.859,I'll be back in about a minute.
00:25:26.859,00:25:28.444,In a minute.
00:25:28.444,00:25:30.654,I'll be right back.
00:25:35.242,00:25:37.244,"Oh, God."
00:27:50.668,00:27:52.712,TED: Hello?
00:27:52.712,00:27:56.550,"Ted, I'm in his apartment."
00:27:59.803,00:28:02.515,The urn is missing.
00:28:02.515,00:28:04.266,"Yeah, I think it might have been."
00:28:04.266,00:28:07.102,He had this satchel last night.
00:28:04.266,00:28:09.938,"He was carrying this bag, and I think that might've been what he had in his satchel."
00:28:09.938,00:28:12.983,"Listen, I'd get out of there right away if I were you."
00:28:12.983,00:28:14.568,"No, no, no."
00:28:14.568,00:28:16.403,We'll talk more from your apartment.
00:28:16.403,00:28:19.865,He's not going snorkeling with his brother.
00:28:19.865,00:28:27.039,He's got two tickets to Paris and he's got reservations at the Georges V Hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.
00:28:28.207,00:28:30.292,"Oh, hi. How are you?"
00:28:30.292,00:28:32.961,Good. You got the notice on the maintenance increase?
00:28:32.961,00:28:34.213,"No, when did that happen?"
00:28:34.213,00:28:37.508,"I'm gonna look around, see what else I can dig up here, okay?"
00:28:37.508,00:28:39.426,Yeah.
00:28:37.508,00:28:42.513,"I'm telling you, this is just..."
00:28:42.513,00:28:44.973,This is just the craziest thing I've ever done.
00:28:44.973,00:28:46.559,"TED: Yes, it's crazy."
00:28:46.559,00:28:49.019,But soon we'll be too old to do anything crazy.
00:28:49.019,00:28:50.979,"Go. Leave, leave, leave."
00:30:05.804,00:30:07.847,Hello.
00:30:07.847,00:30:10.142,"PAUL: Oh, hi. Yeah."
00:30:10.142,00:30:13.437,"I know, I..."
00:30:14.813,00:30:17.107,I did.
00:30:18.651,00:30:20.360,"Yeah, look, I..."
00:30:20.360,00:30:22.279,"Okay, I have to run."
00:30:22.279,00:30:24.406,"But I'll see you later, okay?"
00:30:24.406,00:30:26.325,Okay.
00:30:41.256,00:30:43.383,PAUL: Extension five.
00:30:44.635,00:30:47.012,"Keep ringing, would you please?"
00:30:47.012,00:30:49.181,Because I just talked to her.
00:30:50.390,00:30:51.975,What?
00:30:51.975,00:30:54.144,Okay.
00:30:54.144,00:30:56.480,"Uh, would you tell her...?"
00:30:56.480,00:30:59.065,"Yes, tell her that Tom called."
00:30:59.065,00:31:00.609,Tom.
00:31:00.609,00:31:02.277,Thank you.
00:31:16.667,00:31:18.877,LARRY: I thought your rewrites were great.
00:31:18.877,00:31:22.548,"I really think you helped your book. It's dense, but..."
00:31:22.548,00:31:24.675,I don't want it to be too transparent...
00:31:24.675,00:31:27.302,That's something you'll never have to worry about that.
00:31:27.302,00:31:30.305,This book makes Finnegan's Wake look like airplane reading.
00:31:30.305,00:31:32.641,But it's long...
00:31:30.305,00:31:35.769,"You're the only editor I'll take suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it."
00:31:35.769,00:31:38.146,"No, I'm not pushing."
00:31:38.146,00:31:41.441,"LARRY: You know, but..."
00:31:41.441,00:31:45.904,"As I was reading, I kept thinking, how much did you base it on your life?"
00:31:45.904,00:31:48.699,Well I was a waitress.
00:31:48.699,00:31:52.285,"Um, I lived with a poet."
00:31:52.285,00:31:54.079,"Right, but not a blackjack dealer?"
00:31:54.079,00:31:56.749,"No, but I put myself through school playing poker."
00:31:56.749,00:32:01.086,"Oh, really? Do you still play?"
00:32:01.086,00:32:03.672,Yes? Are you good?
00:32:03.672,00:32:05.758,'Cause maybe you could give me pointers.
00:32:05.758,00:32:07.926,I could turn your game around in two hours.
00:32:07.926,00:32:11.513,Could you? That's great.
00:32:11.513,00:32:19.271,"You have all these skills and you're beautiful and you can write so well, and now it turns out you play poker."
00:32:19.271,00:32:22.107,This is too good to be true.
00:32:22.107,00:32:23.817,"LARRY: Oh, I would."
00:32:22.107,00:32:25.861,But I do have tremendous sex appeal.
00:32:25.861,00:32:29.030,Okay. You sold me.
00:32:29.030,00:32:31.617,Are you seeing anybody?
00:32:31.617,00:32:33.869,MARCIA: No. Don't let my confidence fool you.
00:32:33.869,00:32:36.580,It's a facade.
00:32:36.580,00:32:42.586,"'Cause I have a friend who became single recently, and he would get a big kick out of you."
00:32:42.586,00:32:45.422,Oh. So when do you want your poker lessons?
00:32:45.422,00:32:49.175,"Uh, next week."
00:32:49.175,00:32:50.928,We could...
00:32:49.175,00:32:55.474,"I'll put you on my expense account and you could teach me when to bet, when to fold."
00:32:55.474,00:32:57.559,How about a cheeseburger right now?
00:32:57.559,00:32:59.519,Now?
00:32:59.519,00:33:01.897,That's a possibility.
00:33:01.897,00:33:04.065,Hello?
00:33:04.065,00:33:05.776,Yes.
00:33:07.903,00:33:10.029,Where are you?
00:33:10.029,00:33:12.699,Is everything okay?
00:33:12.699,00:33:14.701,Really?
00:33:14.701,00:33:17.704,"No, I could."
00:33:17.704,00:33:22.960,"Yeah. I need, you know, five minutes or so. Okay."
00:33:22.960,00:33:25.545,"Yes, I know where it is."
00:33:25.545,00:33:29.549,I can't do it. My wife-- I have a little thing I have to do.
00:33:29.549,00:33:32.427,"I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week, or something."
00:33:32.427,00:33:34.262,Story of my life.
00:33:35.722,00:33:38.183,"What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment?"
00:33:38.183,00:33:40.477,Are you nuts?
00:33:40.477,00:33:42.437,A fuddy-dud?
00:33:42.437,00:33:44.940,What are you talking about?
00:33:44.940,00:33:47.400,"That's burglary, and breaking &amp; entering."
00:33:47.400,00:33:50.362,What has gotten into you lately?
00:33:47.400,00:33:52.238,"For crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause."
00:33:52.238,00:33:55.074,CAROL: It was a cinch. I took the key and I let myself in.
00:33:55.074,00:33:58.537,"Hey, look, you'll wind up rooming with John Gotti."
00:33:58.537,00:34:02.833,"You can't do that, you can't just steal a key and go into somebody's apartment."
00:34:02.833,00:34:05.251,"Listen, he's not going snorkeling with his brother."
00:34:05.251,00:34:08.338,"LARRY: I don't want to know, I don't want to be an accessory."
00:34:08.338,00:34:12.467,He's going to Paris to a fancy hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.
00:34:12.467,00:34:14.427,I don't want to know.
00:34:14.427,00:34:18.181,LARRY: You told Ted before me?
00:34:18.181,00:34:20.976,LARRY: I know. I'm a bore.
00:34:20.976,00:34:23.562,I live within the Constitution so I'm dull.
00:34:23.562,00:34:26.439,CAROL: He got rid of the urn.
00:34:26.439,00:34:28.650,CAROL: He talked on the phone with a woman.
00:34:28.650,00:34:30.861,LARRY: How do you know?
00:34:28.650,00:34:33.530,"CAROL: Because, he-- He came back while I was there."
00:34:33.530,00:34:35.490,"CAROL: Yeah, but I hid under the bed."
00:34:35.490,00:34:39.077,LARRY: You hid under his bed?
00:34:39.077,00:34:42.288,I cannot believe this.
00:34:42.288,00:34:46.043,He was very lovey-dovey with this kind of bimbo.
00:34:46.043,00:34:48.670,"He kept saying stuff like, Don't worry."
00:34:48.670,00:34:51.381,It's gonna be all right.
00:34:51.381,00:34:53.550,But what would you have done if he found you?
00:34:53.550,00:34:56.011,I couldn't think that far ahead.
00:34:56.011,00:34:58.221,That far ahead?
00:34:58.221,00:35:00.766,He could've looked under the bed and there you are.
00:35:00.766,00:35:02.517,"Yeah, but Larry, listen to this."
00:35:02.517,00:35:05.478,He called this woman back.
00:35:05.478,00:35:07.439,I don't want to know.
00:35:07.439,00:35:10.316,"And when he calls her back, she's not there."
00:35:10.316,00:35:16.823,And then he leaves this message and says: Tell her Tom called.
00:35:16.823,00:35:19.743,"Tom, Larry, Tom!"
00:35:19.743,00:35:22.079,But I don't care.
00:35:22.079,00:35:26.083,"I tell you, I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted."
00:35:26.083,00:35:29.044,I don't think a private eye could have done better.
00:35:29.044,00:35:31.129,I put everything back where I found it.
00:35:31.129,00:35:33.465,I was very careful.
00:35:33.465,00:35:34.967,What?
00:35:34.967,00:35:37.761,I left my reading glasses on his table.
00:35:39.137,00:35:40.639,"CAROL: Oh, hello, hi."
00:35:40.639,00:35:42.808,I thought I'd bring you some chocolate mousse.
00:35:42.808,00:35:45.102,I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.
00:35:45.102,00:35:48.647,I thought I'd give you another shot at something delicious.
00:35:48.647,00:35:51.775,Do you want me to serve that?
00:35:51.775,00:35:53.610,We can all have some.
00:35:53.610,00:35:55.403,I'll get plates.
00:35:55.403,00:35:58.281,"Okay, over here."
00:36:04.329,00:36:07.082,How are you doing in there?
00:36:07.082,00:36:08.291,You need any help?
00:36:08.291,00:36:10.085,"No, I'm fine."
00:36:10.085,00:36:11.753,"CAROL: Okay, great."
00:36:11.753,00:36:14.631,No. You're going to ruin everything.
00:36:20.595,00:36:22.639,What are you doing?
00:36:25.391,00:36:28.020,Are you okay?
00:36:28.020,00:36:30.105,PAUL: Coffee or tea?
00:36:30.105,00:36:32.732,I'd like some tea.
00:36:32.732,00:36:34.860,Mine?
00:36:34.860,00:36:38.321,"Yes! No, yeah--No, no, no."
00:36:38.321,00:36:39.739,These ones are...
00:36:39.739,00:36:41.908,"Actually, they are mine."
00:36:41.908,00:36:44.202,I think the other night I must have left them.
00:36:44.202,00:36:46.830,Did you? I didn't notice.
00:36:46.830,00:36:50.542,"Remember, you thought I left them at your mother's house."
00:36:50.542,00:36:53.211,Right. Of course. Anyway.
00:36:53.211,00:36:55.130,"It's so good, I love mousse."
00:36:55.130,00:36:57.632,Are you looking forward to snorkeling?
00:36:57.632,00:37:00.593,Very much. It's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.
00:37:00.593,00:37:04.181,I must have dropped them and they got kicked under.
00:37:04.181,00:37:07.433,They were just-- She drops things and kicks them.
00:37:07.433,00:37:09.811,"So, mousse?"
00:37:09.811,00:37:12.731,Remember when you kicked mousse under the bed?
00:37:12.731,00:37:15.025,CAROL: I remember.

00:38:12.249,00:38:21.549,"Maybe she died of natural causes like the doctor said, and we're just two people with hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little shot of adrenaline."
00:38:21.549,00:38:24.052,"TED: Does yours? I tell you, mine needs something."
00:38:24.052,00:38:26.138,CAROL: What's that?
00:38:26.138,00:38:27.722,You want a jelly donut?
00:38:27.722,00:38:29.975,Come on.
00:38:29.975,00:38:32.435,CAROL: Okay.
00:38:32.435,00:38:34.146,CAROL: What? What?
00:38:34.146,00:38:37.232,TED: Helen! Helen!
00:38:37.232,00:38:38.399,"CAROL: Ted! Oh, God."
00:38:38.399,00:38:39.609,TED: Helen!
00:38:40.860,00:38:43.238,It's not her.
00:38:43.238,00:38:44.864,"No, it's not her."
00:38:46.074,00:38:47.492,What?
00:38:47.492,00:38:51.412,"You really have this worked out, don't you?"
00:38:56.793,00:38:59.754,I figured she'd come out and go to work.
00:38:59.754,00:39:01.506,Maybe she doesn't work.
00:39:01.506,00:39:04.759,Maybe she's like you and she has writer's hours.
00:39:04.759,00:39:09.139,I'm writing a play about something that happened to us.
00:39:09.139,00:39:11.724,"Oh, God."
00:39:11.724,00:39:18.231,Remember that time you and I and Larry and Julie were on that eating tour of France?
00:39:18.231,00:39:20.317,"Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah."
00:39:20.317,00:39:22.610,And they wandered off and forgot to pick us up?
00:39:22.610,00:39:24.946,We had to share that bed-and-breakfast place.
00:39:24.946,00:39:27.115,Remember those wonderful cottages?
00:39:27.115,00:39:31.536,"And I remember that we shared a bedroom together, right?"
00:39:31.536,00:39:33.788,Not a bed.
00:39:33.788,00:39:37.334,"Well, God, you were too gentlemanly to suggest that."
00:39:37.334,00:39:40.670,TED: Well it's not that I didn't think of it.
00:39:40.670,00:39:42.005,CAROL: No.
00:39:42.005,00:39:48.261,I knew what was going on in your mind because of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux.
00:39:48.261,00:39:50.805,It could have been our little secret.
00:39:50.805,00:39:52.891,Then you passed out.
00:39:54.726,00:40:00.481,"Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?"
00:40:00.481,00:40:04.110,Not that long ago.
00:40:16.622,00:40:18.666,"Look. Look, look, look."
00:40:20.585,00:40:24.256,TED: Helen! Duck.
00:40:24.256,00:40:26.007,TED: She didn't see us.
00:40:26.007,00:40:30.136,TED: That's gotta be her.
00:40:30.136,00:40:32.264,CAROL: She answers to Helen.
00:40:32.264,00:40:33.806,TED: Yeah.
00:40:33.806,00:40:35.183,What's she doing?
00:40:35.183,00:40:37.227,TED: She's getting a cab.
00:40:37.227,00:40:39.229,TED: Keep down.

00:41:18.351,00:41:21.479,"Oh, this is beautiful."
00:41:21.479,00:41:23.273,We show revivals now.
00:41:23.273,00:41:25.024,This week we have Fred Astaire.
00:41:25.024,00:41:27.652,Next week we have an Orson Welles festival.
00:41:27.652,00:41:32.490,I think that will be about the last thing we do before we start renovating.
00:41:32.490,00:41:34.951,"HELEN: Oh, Paul."
00:41:32.490,00:41:37.036,"PAUL: Come on, there's nobody around."
00:41:37.036,00:41:39.664,Okay.
00:41:39.664,00:41:43.042,HELEN: I've never been behind a movie screen before.
00:41:43.042,00:41:44.877,"PAUL: Strange, isn't it?"
00:41:44.877,00:41:49.966,"It used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was better. Beautiful, huh?"
00:41:49.966,00:41:51.468,HELEN: All these mirrors.
00:41:51.468,00:41:54.679,It used to be all mirrors.
00:41:54.679,00:41:58.224,I'm having this broken glass replaced as we go along.
00:41:58.224,00:42:00.685,They used to have stage shows here.
00:42:00.685,00:42:02.937,"Of course, now we only show old movies."
00:42:02.937,00:42:04.730,HELEN: It has such a lonely feeling.
00:42:04.730,00:42:06.858,PAUL: It's 'cause I'm the only one here.
00:42:06.858,00:42:08.734,"And my assistant, Mrs. Dalton."
00:42:08.734,00:42:11.737,"I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'll sell it."
00:42:11.737,00:42:13.448,The money is gonna come in handy.
00:42:13.448,00:42:15.908,It sure will.
00:42:15.908,00:42:17.827,What's that noise?
00:42:17.827,00:42:20.913,"PAUL: Mrs. Dalton, I didn't know you were here so early."
00:42:20.913,00:42:23.791,I didn't know anyone was here. I'm sorry.
00:42:23.791,00:42:27.462,"I heard a noise, but I apologize."
00:42:27.462,00:42:29.130,PAUL: It's quite all right.
00:42:29.130,00:42:31.883,HELEN: I'd love to really get an acting job.
00:42:31.883,00:42:33.385,I've had it with modeling.
00:42:33.385,00:42:35.678,PAUL: Maybe you won't have to work at all.
00:42:55.656,00:42:57.492,"Oh, my God."
00:43:02.330,00:43:03.998,What's the matter?
00:43:03.998,00:43:06.376,"Larry, come with me, okay?"
00:43:06.376,00:43:07.835,"Oh, jeez."
00:43:07.835,00:43:10.046,"I was asleep, dreaming of round card girls."
00:43:10.046,00:43:12.507,CAROL: Okay. It looks like he's gone.
00:43:12.507,00:43:15.301,"Yeah. Yeah, he's gone."
00:43:15.301,00:43:18.637,"Listen, Larry, I want to take another look at his apartment."
00:43:18.637,00:43:21.057,What are you talking about?
00:43:21.057,00:43:24.602,"He'll never be back, Larry."
00:43:24.602,00:43:27.230,"CAROL: No, he's not coming back."
00:43:27.230,00:43:30.900,CAROL: Yeah.
00:43:30.900,00:43:32.944,You followed him to the movie house.
00:43:32.944,00:43:34.737,You said there was nothing happening.
00:43:34.737,00:43:39.867,"No, he was with this young model type, and they were talking about money."
00:43:39.867,00:43:41.994,Well so what?
00:43:41.994,00:43:44.330,"Wha-- Hey, listen to me."
00:43:44.330,00:43:46.999,CAROL: What are you talking about?
00:43:46.999,00:43:49.335,I think you gotta go back your shrink.
00:43:49.335,00:43:51.170,I want you to see Dr. Ballard.
00:43:51.170,00:43:53.506,"Larry, I went for two years."
00:43:53.506,00:43:56.593,You know how General Motors will recall defective cars?
00:43:56.593,00:43:58.219,You gotta go in for a tune-up.
00:43:58.219,00:44:00.513,We'll be out in five minutes. Five.
00:44:00.513,00:44:02.432,"I'm telling you, I'm your husband."
00:44:02.432,00:44:04.309,I command you to sleep.
00:44:04.309,00:44:06.478,I command it. Sleep!
00:44:04.309,00:44:10.064,"All I can tell you is, if this had been a few years ago, you would do the same thing."
00:44:10.064,00:44:14.860,"Because if you recall, we solved a mystery."
00:44:14.860,00:44:18.239,Remember? It was the noises in the attic mystery.
00:44:18.239,00:44:20.783,The country house. The bluebird.
00:44:18.239,00:44:23.702,I know. But that-- That was a sweet mystery.
00:44:23.702,00:44:26.414,"You agree, right?"
00:44:26.414,00:44:29.000,"No, I forbid you!"
00:44:29.000,00:44:32.170,I'm forbidding-- Is that what you do when I forbid you?
00:44:32.170,00:44:35.590,I'm not going to be forbidding you a lot if you do...
00:44:40.386,00:44:42.680,Damn it.
00:44:42.680,00:44:45.642,"We should be asleep, in our cuddling position."
00:44:45.642,00:44:47.560,"Please be quiet, Larry."
00:44:47.560,00:44:49.646,"You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay?"
00:44:49.646,00:44:50.647,"It's okay, I got it."
00:44:50.647,00:44:52.064,LARRY: This is no good.
00:44:52.064,00:44:55.109,This could only lead to great unhappiness.
00:44:55.109,00:44:57.362,"CAROL: Relax, okay?"
00:44:57.362,00:45:00.156,How can I relax?
00:44:57.362,00:45:02.200,I'm in a strange man's apartment in my T-shirt and pajamas.
00:45:02.200,00:45:04.452,Ted told me to try something here.
00:45:04.452,00:45:06.871,Ted told you?
00:45:06.871,00:45:11.083,Ted is a sick schmuck.
00:45:11.083,00:45:13.294,What if he comes back?
00:45:13.294,00:45:14.753,My heart is...
00:45:14.753,00:45:17.298,Who?
00:45:17.298,00:45:19.467,MAN: Who is this?
00:45:19.467,00:45:20.843,Um. Who's this?
00:45:20.843,00:45:23.012,Do you know anybody named Waldron?
00:45:23.012,00:45:25.181,"Hang the phone up, hang the phone up."
00:45:25.181,00:45:28.017,Great. Now they hung up on us.
00:45:28.017,00:45:31.479,Let me think.
00:45:31.479,00:45:33.856,"He used the name Tom, so Tom Waldron."
00:45:33.856,00:45:35.650,We gotta run a check on that.
00:45:35.650,00:45:37.818,What you want to beat it down to the morgue?
00:45:37.818,00:45:40.238,You got all the jargon.
00:45:40.238,00:45:42.948,LARRY: I'm not a night person.
00:45:42.948,00:45:45.868,I don't know what I'm looking for.
00:45:45.868,00:45:48.079,"Oh, oh, wait. Look."
00:45:48.079,00:45:50.498,"What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail?"
00:45:50.498,00:45:52.417,This is insane.
00:45:52.417,00:45:54.835,"Jesus! Oh, Christ!"
00:45:54.835,00:45:57.547,Clean it up. Hurry up.
00:45:57.547,00:46:00.007,What am I gonna do? Vacuum?
00:46:00.007,00:46:01.842,I can't!
00:46:01.842,00:46:04.512,I broke his porcelain...
00:46:01.842,00:46:07.056,"Well, then, glue it back-- What do you mean, glue it?"
00:46:07.056,00:46:08.391,Look.
00:46:08.391,00:46:10.560,Look!
00:46:10.560,00:46:12.895,I have gloves.
00:46:10.560,00:46:16.107,"I know, but do you keep yours out on the bureau in this kind of weather?"
00:46:16.107,00:46:18.817,Let's get out of here-- Something's very strange here.
00:46:18.817,00:46:21.404,He left these out.
00:46:21.404,00:46:24.865,It's eye of the beholder.
00:46:24.865,00:46:28.077,"I'm gonna take the pieces with us, we'll get rid of them."
00:46:31.038,00:46:33.416,CAROL: So how did you like your birthday cake?
00:46:33.416,00:46:36.461,"I loved it. But then again, I love chocolate anything."
00:46:36.461,00:46:38.504,I know.
00:46:38.504,00:46:41.924,What are you laughing about?
00:46:41.924,00:46:45.219,"I was going to, but they're working us so hard at school."
00:46:45.219,00:46:46.845,I gotta get back.
00:46:46.845,00:46:49.599,I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present.
00:46:49.599,00:46:53.311,She's going to a wine tasting.
00:46:53.311,00:46:56.855,"If I'm gonna be a restaurant owner, I should know about wines-- Larry?"
00:46:56.855,00:46:58.524,Hey.
00:46:58.524,00:47:00.359,LARRY: I want you to meet somebody.
00:47:00.359,00:47:01.986,CAROL: What?
00:47:01.986,00:47:04.322,LARRY: Hi. How are you?
00:47:04.322,00:47:06.449,This is my wife.
00:47:06.449,00:47:09.952,Carol. Remember me?
00:47:09.952,00:47:12.330,Hi.
00:47:12.330,00:47:15.916,"My son, it's his birthday, so we took him to 21."
00:47:15.916,00:47:18.544,Your friend called me.
00:47:15.916,00:47:21.297,He's taking me to dinner in New Jersey.
00:47:21.297,00:47:22.674,You did?
00:47:22.674,00:47:24.634,That place we ate at.
00:47:24.634,00:47:26.927,You'll have a good time.
00:47:26.927,00:47:30.640,Well good to see you.
00:47:30.640,00:47:33.850,She'll have a great time.
00:47:33.850,00:47:36.020,LARRY: What are you making a face for?
00:47:36.020,00:47:37.980,You think she's Ted's type?
00:47:37.980,00:47:40.817,She's anybody's type.
00:47:40.817,00:47:43.944,"You know, your pupils are dilating."
00:47:43.944,00:47:46.113,She's dangerously sexual.
00:47:46.113,00:47:50.827,"Listen, when you go to the wine tasting, getting back to real life, spit it out."
00:47:50.827,00:47:53.078,"Don't drink too much, mom."
00:47:53.078,00:47:59.918,"Spit it out, I don't want you on the bathroom floor with your head by the bowl tonight."
00:47:59.918,00:48:03.381,TED: That Mouton '45.
00:48:03.381,00:48:05.633,"TED: That was, like, sublime, you know?"
00:48:05.633,00:48:08.093,CAROL: Yeah.
00:48:08.093,00:48:09.970,Wasn't that a nice surprise?
00:48:09.970,00:48:12.181,Wasn't that great?
00:48:12.181,00:48:15.017,CAROL: So...
00:48:15.017,00:48:17.478,So Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox?
00:48:17.478,00:48:19.104,"Yeah, well, you know."
00:48:19.104,00:48:21.566,He says she's wonderful.
00:48:21.566,00:48:24.068,I'm trying to get out and meet people.
00:48:24.068,00:48:26.153,I'm not looking forward to this.
00:48:26.153,00:48:27.904,So you're taking her to Vincent's?
00:48:27.904,00:48:29.657,Yeah. I guess.
00:48:29.657,00:48:33.035,She's not my first choice.
00:48:33.035,00:48:38.374,"God, look at this."
00:48:40.000,00:48:42.169,"TED: Course, I can't have my first choice."
00:48:42.169,00:48:44.756,CAROL: No? Hm...
00:48:44.756,00:48:47.299,"I'm getting drunk, I don't know what I'm saying."
00:48:47.299,00:48:50.595,So am I.
00:48:55.057,00:48:57.934,I'm gonna be late for my shrink.
00:48:57.934,00:48:58.853,You've gotta go?
00:48:58.853,00:49:00.937,Yeah.
00:49:04.776,00:49:08.195,"You know, you would be my first choice."
00:49:09.655,00:49:11.616,"Me, huh?"
00:49:11.616,00:49:13.785,Well.
00:49:16.203,00:49:17.996,"Oh, boy."
00:49:19.749,00:49:22.251,Can I give you a lift?
00:49:22.251,00:49:25.463,"No, I think I'll stick around."
00:49:25.463,00:49:27.089,"I feel a little, you know, tipsy."
00:49:27.089,00:49:28.800,I didn't offend you by what I said?
00:49:28.800,00:49:32.136,"No. No, no, no."
00:49:32.136,00:49:36.849,"I was very flattered by this, Ted. Flattered."
00:49:36.849,00:49:38.684,"Well, anyway..."
00:49:38.684,00:49:40.102,See you later.
00:49:40.102,00:49:42.647,"Oh, careful. Woops."
00:50:21.978,00:50:50.214,Ah! Oh-- LARRY: I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers for Nick.
00:50:50.214,00:50:52.758,Really beautiful.
00:50:52.758,00:50:54.677,The kid looked so handsome in it.
00:50:54.677,00:50:58.347,Also I decided I'd cook tonight.
00:50:58.347,00:51:00.558,Well no wonder he had her cremated.
00:51:00.558,00:51:01.893,What?
00:51:01.893,00:51:03.811,CAROL: Mrs. House.
00:51:03.811,00:51:05.730,You're not on about Mrs. House again?
00:51:05.730,00:51:08.900,I thought we'd have a light dinner because we had...
00:51:08.900,00:51:11.903,Larry. I just saw Mrs. House.
00:51:11.903,00:51:14.238,LARRY: What are you talking about?
00:51:14.238,00:51:16.407,A bus passed me and she was on it.
00:51:16.407,00:51:18.283,The dead woman passed you on a bus?
00:51:18.283,00:51:20.202,"Which bus was this, the bus to heaven?"
00:51:20.202,00:51:22.078,I'm not joking.
00:51:20.202,00:51:24.415,"I'm telling you, I really saw her."
00:51:24.415,00:51:25.875,Uh-huh.
00:51:25.875,00:51:27.752,You wanna lie down for a while?
00:51:27.752,00:51:30.170,Put a cold compress or hot compress...
00:51:30.170,00:51:32.548,"I was at the wine tasting, right?"
00:51:32.548,00:51:34.926,And I was sitting at a bay window.
00:51:34.926,00:51:36.552,I happened to look out.
00:51:36.552,00:51:40.096,"A bus passed, and she was on it, Larry..."
00:51:40.096,00:51:42.182,"Yes, remember I said to you, spit it out?"
00:51:42.182,00:51:43.768,I said don't drink it?
00:51:43.768,00:51:46.311,You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon?
00:51:46.311,00:51:48.564,"I said, don't swallow it."
00:51:48.564,00:51:50.733,That's why you're this way.
00:51:48.564,00:51:53.027,"Yeah, I had a few drinks, but..."
00:51:53.027,00:51:54.486,"Yeah, I'm sure you saw her."
00:51:54.486,00:51:57.197,How could you her?
00:51:57.197,00:52:02.036,Are you telling me that I didn't see her? Is that it?
00:52:02.036,00:52:08.751,"LARRY: I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City transit system."
00:52:08.751,00:52:12.880,"I just don't know what's happening, I don't know what's going on What's going on?"
00:52:12.880,00:52:15.925,Let me put it this way.
00:52:15.925,00:52:18.844,Maybe she's a twin.
00:52:18.844,00:52:21.889,"Taste my casserole, tell me if I put in too much hot fudge."
00:52:21.889,00:52:23.975,You're getting so close-minded these days.
00:52:23.975,00:52:26.351,"Oh, God."
00:52:26.351,00:52:29.897,"Hello? Ted! Oh, Ted."
00:52:29.897,00:52:33.692,"You're not going to believe this, but I saw Mrs. House."
00:52:33.692,00:52:37.321,"Yeah, Mrs. House."
00:52:37.321,00:52:39.907,She wasn't murdered.
00:52:39.907,00:52:42.910,"She wasn't murdered, I don't know what she's talking about."
00:52:42.910,00:52:45.037,"No, I'm sure I saw her."
00:52:45.037,00:52:48.124,I saw her just moments after you left.
00:52:48.124,00:52:50.001,Right. He was at the wine tasting too.
00:52:50.001,00:52:52.920,"Sure, why not."
00:52:52.920,00:52:56.048,Just run a check on Paul and Lillian House...
00:52:56.048,00:52:58.467,Don't run a check.
00:52:58.467,00:53:00.928,Can you call back?
00:53:00.928,00:53:05.516,"Forget it. If you're gonna have an affair with a guy, you don't need a murder to do it."
00:53:05.516,00:53:07.601,"I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House."
00:53:07.601,00:53:09.812,"Yes, I know."
00:53:09.812,00:53:11.981,"Now, sit down."
00:53:11.981,00:53:14.399,"I can show you the exact spot, Larry."
00:53:14.399,00:53:17.695,What about lunch? Tomorrow?
00:53:17.695,00:53:19.404,"No, I've got a business lunch."
00:53:19.404,00:53:21.657,I tell you.
00:53:21.657,00:53:24.035,I'm vibrating from this.
00:53:24.035,00:53:25.870,LARRY: We got tickets to the theater.
00:53:25.870,00:53:27.913,CAROL: What? I'm not going to the theater.
00:53:27.913,00:53:31.333,LARRY: We've been holding onto these tickets for months.
00:53:31.333,00:53:34.920,Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you?
00:53:34.920,00:53:38.256,"LARRY: If you've got a big story, tell the police, not me."
00:53:38.256,00:53:40.968,What am I going to say to them?
00:53:40.968,00:53:44.055,I don't have a story.
00:53:44.055,00:53:45.848,"That's right, you've got nothing."
00:53:45.848,00:53:49.476,"Unless I locate her, huh?"
00:53:49.476,00:53:53.689,"Good, now sit down 'cause we're going to the theater."
00:53:59.361,00:54:01.989,"LARRY: Oh, Jack."
00:53:59.361,00:54:04.033,"You were there when Mrs. House died, right?"
00:54:04.033,00:54:06.118,You saw her?
00:54:06.118,00:54:07.870,She was lying on the floor.
00:54:07.870,00:54:09.955,"You're sure it was her, right?"
00:54:09.955,00:54:12.290,He's sure.
00:54:12.290,00:54:18.296,My wife's been having some bad dreams and she doesn't know what she's talking about.
00:54:18.296,00:54:23.635,This is for all the times I call you to fix the faucet and you show up six months late.
00:54:29.808,00:54:31.476,The super is a drunk.
00:54:31.476,00:54:36.272,"I know, but, we've seen him smelling of Jack Daniel's. Remember?"
00:54:36.272,00:54:38.234,Well...
00:54:38.234,00:54:41.277,"I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry."
00:54:41.277,00:54:43.948,"If she's a twin, it's a different story."
00:54:43.948,00:54:45.866,But you don't seem to feel she is.
00:54:45.866,00:54:47.659,I don't know.
00:54:49.411,00:54:51.580,Unless he's in on it.
00:54:51.580,00:54:52.915,The super's in on it?
00:54:52.915,00:54:55.251,The super can't change a fuse.
00:54:58.587,00:55:00.547,"I mean, she..."
00:55:00.547,00:55:02.674,What?
00:55:02.674,00:55:09.223,"But my question is, who was in that bag-- She's not alive unless she's a twin."
00:55:09.223,00:55:12.226,"Okay? Now, keep quiet."
00:55:14.603,00:55:17.982,"Somebody got cremated, Larry, somebody."
00:55:17.982,00:55:19.733,Shut up.
00:55:21.277,00:55:23.237,TED: Lillian House.
00:55:23.237,00:55:25.072,"Maiden name, Lillian Beale."
00:55:25.072,00:55:27.574,"Born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, 1935."
00:55:27.574,00:55:30.535,Married Paul Richard House.
00:55:30.535,00:55:37.042,"Had an older sister who went to England 20 years ago, and an older brother who died in 1987."
00:55:37.042,00:55:38.252,Right here.
00:55:38.252,00:55:40.045,This is it.
00:55:40.045,00:55:48.804,"CAROL: I know. And I was sitting there after you left, and I was having a glass of wine, and I looked out and saw..."
00:55:48.804,00:55:53.142,"Yes, I saw her on a bus."
00:55:53.142,00:55:55.978,"Wait, you're absolutely sure you saw her?"
00:55:55.978,00:55:58.063,You saw her face?
00:55:58.063,00:56:00.191,Oh. Excuse me.
00:56:00.191,00:56:03.194,I'm telling you-- What was the number on the bus?
00:56:03.194,00:56:07.531,"I don't know the number, but I know that it was heading west to east."
00:56:07.531,00:56:09.658,It obviously was a cross-town bus.
00:56:09.658,00:56:11.952,"Okay, look."
00:56:11.952,00:56:15.164,The end of the line is a few blocks down there.
00:56:15.164,00:56:17.833,So she had to get off somewhere.
00:56:17.833,00:56:20.585,Her destination was the next six blocks.
00:56:20.585,00:56:22.629,"Yeah, right, so let's look around."
00:56:22.629,00:56:26.508,"Maybe we'll see, you know, a clue or something."
00:56:26.508,00:56:29.511,Maybe we'll see her.
00:56:29.511,00:56:31.263,Don't doubt me.
00:56:33.598,00:56:36.977,Well I think we reached the end of the line.
00:56:36.977,00:56:39.604,TED: I think this is it.
00:56:39.604,00:56:42.274,Watch out. Watch...
00:56:43.901,00:56:47.238,TED: Look. See?
00:56:47.238,00:56:49.948,"Yeah, I know."
00:56:49.948,00:56:51.116,What?
00:56:49.948,00:56:52.868,Think we should retrace our steps?
00:56:52.868,00:56:56.330,TED: You wear a tie with a dress.
00:56:56.330,00:56:59.875,"CAROL: No, I don't think it looks good."
00:56:56.330,00:57:01.960,I don't even know if it looks-- It'd be too masculine with pants.
00:57:01.960,00:57:04.504,TED: Just don't wear it with pants.
00:57:04.504,00:57:07.341,CAROL: Ted. Look.
00:57:07.341,00:57:08.717,TED: At what? What?
00:57:08.717,00:57:10.594,CAROL: That hotel.
00:57:10.594,00:57:19.728,"CAROL: Well that's Waldron. I remember, I was in his apartment, I pressed the last number dialed, and they answered and said Waldron."
00:57:19.728,00:57:22.773,"Hello. Mrs. House, please?"
00:57:22.773,00:57:26.277,"Mrs. House. Can you ring her room for me, please?"
00:57:28.362,00:57:30.072,Really?
00:57:30.072,00:57:34.118,What? Maybe...
00:57:34.118,00:57:37.913,"CAROL: Oh, God."
00:57:37.913,00:57:39.539,Uh...
00:57:39.539,00:57:44.336,"What about, yeah, what about Helen Moss. Moss."
00:57:44.336,00:57:48.590,You're sure? Nobody.
00:57:48.590,00:57:51.509,"All right, okay."
00:57:51.509,00:57:53.011,Great.
00:57:53.011,00:57:57.224,"Oh, God. It looks like it's gonna rain again."
00:57:57.224,00:57:59.393,Well?
00:57:59.393,00:58:01.686,"If I get two kings, I take one."
00:58:01.686,00:58:03.647,"Otherwise, I fold."
00:58:03.647,00:58:05.523,I never go out.
00:58:05.523,00:58:08.152,"I just, I can't..."
00:58:08.152,00:58:10.028,That's how you wind up on welfare.
00:58:10.028,00:58:12.281,"LARRY: But I need the action, for some reason."
00:58:12.281,00:58:14.408,I can't bet anything.
00:58:14.408,00:58:16.076,MARCIA: Cut?
00:58:16.076,00:58:17.411,I trust you. Lay it on me.
00:58:27.463,00:58:31.175,You seem in a strange mood.
00:58:31.175,00:58:34.552,On Perrier?
00:58:34.552,00:58:37.681,Want any cards?
00:58:37.681,00:58:40.809,Let me see what possibilities I got here.
00:58:40.809,00:58:44.062,Yeah. I'm gonna have...
00:58:44.062,00:58:46.023,I'll have...
00:58:47.691,00:58:49.401,I'm gonna have four cards.
00:58:49.401,00:58:53.113,Yeah.
00:58:53.113,00:58:55.615,Inside and outside straight.
00:58:58.494,00:59:01.413,You're in trouble now.
00:59:01.413,00:59:08.086,I can't escape the feeling that my wife is becoming attracted to somebody else.
00:59:08.086,00:59:11.048,And it's really bothering me.
00:59:11.048,00:59:13.842,"Yeah, that's why I'm not playing my best."
00:59:15.969,00:59:20.516,"This guy's more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they just hit it off."
00:59:20.516,00:59:24.561,"I'm gonna be very lonely, you know, if this happens."
00:59:24.561,00:59:28.232,You must love her a lot.
00:59:30.650,00:59:33.611,"If you want to hold on to her, you have to make some effort."
00:59:33.611,00:59:34.988,"I mean, who's the guy?"
00:59:34.988,00:59:36.698,Uh...
00:59:36.698,00:59:39.284,Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.
00:59:39.284,00:59:40.952,Ted?
00:59:40.952,00:59:42.454,Well we could always switch.
00:59:42.454,00:59:44.456,"Ted gets Carol, I can be your date."
00:59:46.458,00:59:50.546,Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with Carol.
00:59:58.595,01:00:00.264,So you bored?
01:00:00.264,01:00:03.141,Well it's more fun than the Wagner opera.
01:00:03.141,01:00:07.604,"Yeah. Well, to me, it's one of the most exciting adventures I've ever been on."
01:00:07.604,01:00:08.980,Mm-hmm.
01:00:08.980,01:00:10.774,Would you rather be here with Ted?
01:00:10.774,01:00:13.402,"Well he has a more enthused attitude, Larry."
01:00:13.402,01:00:15.487,More enthused?
01:00:15.487,01:00:18.490,"He's a fun guy, a light guy."
01:00:18.490,01:00:21.743,"No, look, Larry."
01:00:21.743,01:00:24.288,"If you have a heavy scavenger hunt, he's the man."
01:00:24.288,01:00:28.750,"I know, but, you know-- Do you know that this neighborhood-- What?"
01:00:28.750,01:00:32.629,--was where I first took you when we started going out?
01:00:32.629,01:00:36.007,For some reason you've gotten so stodgy in your old age.
01:00:36.007,01:00:38.009,Remember there was a movie house?
01:00:38.009,01:00:39.844,"Yes! Yeah, I remember."
01:00:39.844,01:00:42.347,I took you to see Last Year at Marienbad.
01:00:42.347,01:00:46.477,"Yeah, I know, I had to explain it to you for six months."
01:00:46.477,01:00:49.729,Who knew they were flashbacks?
01:00:49.729,01:00:53.733,We've got plenty of time to be conservative. You know?
01:00:53.733,01:00:57.154,Don't you see?
01:00:53.733,01:00:59.072,It's like this tantalizing plum has just dropped into our laps.
01:00:59.072,01:01:02.576,"Life is such a dull routine and here we are, right?"
01:01:02.576,01:01:08.624,We're on the threshold of a genuine mystery. To me-- Are you gonna burst into song?
01:01:08.624,01:01:11.668,"Just don't make fun of me, I'm open to new experiences."
01:01:11.668,01:01:14.338,Let me ask you a personal question here.
01:01:14.338,01:01:16.006,Did you ever sleep with Ted?
01:01:16.006,01:01:19.301,Don't get nervous.
01:01:19.301,01:01:24.348,"Remember we were on an eating tour of France, you two spent an evening together."
01:01:24.348,01:01:26.808,I know. What about you?
01:01:26.808,01:01:29.060,"You spent the evening with Julie, am I right?"
01:01:29.060,01:01:31.771,That meant absolutely nothing.
01:01:29.060,01:01:33.731,"She hated me, Julie despised me."
01:01:33.731,01:01:36.776,"She thought I was a lowlife, a wimp and a roach."
01:01:36.776,01:01:39.154,Jump in any time you want to defend me.
01:01:39.154,01:01:42.949,"Hey, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't agree with, okay?"
01:01:42.949,01:01:45.910,"Hey, you're nailing me. Jesus."
01:01:47.078,01:01:48.664,Larry?
01:01:48.664,01:01:50.707,"Larry, Larry, look."
01:01:50.707,01:01:53.001,It's her! I'd say it's her!
01:01:53.001,01:01:55.420,"LARRY: Oh, my God, it is."
01:01:53.001,01:01:57.755,"CAROL: See what I mean, I was right all along!"
01:01:57.755,01:02:00.842,CAROL: I'm positive. Yes.
01:02:00.842,01:02:02.886,CAROL: Right? Right?
01:02:02.886,01:02:06.223,"Jesus, I'm..."
01:02:06.223,01:02:07.849,That is her.
01:02:07.849,01:02:09.434,I told you so.
01:02:09.434,01:02:11.478,"What are you talking about, you're nuts."
01:02:11.478,01:02:13.230,"Oh, Jesus."
01:02:13.230,01:02:16.107,I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.
01:02:16.107,01:02:18.943,"Let's go out there, find out what's going on."
01:02:18.943,01:02:20.487,"No, I don't want to."
01:02:20.487,01:02:22.364,"You're not afraid of her, are you?"
01:02:22.364,01:02:25.116,"I'm not afraid, she's an old woman, I'm a virile male."
01:02:25.116,01:02:27.911,"Yet, somehow, I am scared."
01:02:27.911,01:02:30.080,I'm gonna break this thing wide open.
01:02:30.080,01:02:31.623,How?
01:02:31.623,01:02:35.126,"God, if only Ted were here."
01:02:35.126,01:02:37.795,Let's get out of here.
01:02:37.795,01:02:39.923,I know what we should do.
01:02:37.795,01:02:42.426,"We get a gift, we'll surprise her."
01:02:42.426,01:02:44.720,How?
01:02:51.142,01:02:53.478,Excuse me. Hi.
01:02:53.478,01:02:55.813,"We were wondering, did you see a woman come in?"
01:02:55.813,01:02:58.567,"She was a little woman, about 5'3?"
01:02:58.567,01:03:00.985,She had on a gray sweater?
01:02:58.567,01:03:03.321,With a canvas bag-- Mrs. Caine? Dark hair?
01:03:03.321,01:03:05.115,"Oh, yes."
01:03:05.115,01:03:08.619,We had a present for her.
01:03:08.619,01:03:11.455,611.
01:03:11.455,01:03:14.458,"We may need some information while we're here, so..."
01:03:14.458,01:03:17.377,"I'll take good care of you, if you play ball with us."
01:03:18.670,01:03:20.714,What are you making a face for?
01:03:20.714,01:03:22.674,CAROL: Will you come on?
01:03:22.674,01:03:24.008,What are you doing?
01:03:37.021,01:03:39.608,CAROL: Okay. Room 611.
01:03:43.903,01:03:49.576,LARRY: Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue powder sprinkled along the baseboard.
01:03:53.079,01:03:56.750,"CAROL: 611. Here, Larry."
01:04:00.003,01:04:02.130,Mrs. House?
01:04:05.676,01:04:07.719,CAROL: Mrs. House?
01:04:07.719,01:04:09.262,Hello?
01:04:09.262,01:04:12.056,Mrs... My God.
01:04:12.056,01:04:14.184,CAROL: I don't see her.
01:04:12.056,01:04:17.228,LARRY: This may not be the right place.
01:04:17.228,01:04:20.023,"Hold on, hold on."
01:04:20.023,01:04:21.358,Larry!
01:04:21.358,01:04:23.401,"Oh, my God! Wait!"
01:04:23.401,01:04:27.405,"Oh, my God, look!"
01:04:27.405,01:04:29.574,What's the matter?
01:04:29.574,01:04:31.368,Larry.
01:04:31.368,01:04:34.788,I think she's dead.
01:04:34.788,01:04:36.164,Mrs. House?
01:04:36.164,01:04:37.957,"Oh, come on, let's get out of here!"
01:04:37.957,01:04:39.668,I think she's dead!
01:04:37.957,01:04:41.961,"Oh, my-- I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon."
01:04:41.961,01:04:44.255,This woman is forever dying.
01:04:44.255,01:04:46.424,"LARRY: Come on, move. Move."
01:04:46.424,01:04:49.886,Adrenaline is leaking out of my ears!
01:04:49.886,01:04:53.849,Get down those stairs. Come on.
01:04:53.849,01:05:02.524,What happened was I suspected Mr. House-- I'm looking around and suddenly a hand is on the floor...
01:05:02.524,01:05:09.239,"--and she has no twin, but we checked anyway-- The girl was nervous, I tried to keep calm-- There's no body there."
01:05:09.239,01:05:11.575,What do you mean?
01:05:11.575,01:05:13.702,How can there not be anybody?
01:05:13.702,01:05:15.704,Want to show us where you saw her?
01:05:15.704,01:05:19.791,She was totally dead.
01:05:19.791,01:05:21.877,CAROL: She was right here.
01:05:21.877,01:05:23.670,She was definitely laying here.
01:05:23.670,01:05:25.922,It looked like she was strangled.
01:05:25.922,01:05:30.719,"CAROL: We're not crazy, We're professional people."
01:05:30.719,01:05:33.638,I'm in publishing.
01:05:30.719,01:05:36.099,"I'm starting a restaurant, basically French."
01:05:36.099,01:05:38.976,I'm against the restaurant.
01:05:36.099,01:05:41.563,Not that I have a location-- Calm down.
01:05:41.563,01:05:46.777,"Look, in the time it took you guys to respond, somebody removed the body."
01:05:46.777,01:05:51.364,"Not that you didn't respond quickly, it took three minutes."
01:05:48.612,01:05:53.991,not counting the half-hour the 911 operator took to understand me.
01:05:53.991,01:05:55.577,"Nobody is doubting you, okay?"
01:05:55.577,01:05:57.954,"We're going over the whole building, all right?"
01:05:57.954,01:05:59.122,All right.
01:05:59.122,01:06:00.957,Did you check?
01:06:00.957,01:06:03.251,He's been at his place of business all day.
01:06:03.251,01:06:05.378,Any witnesses?
01:06:05.378,01:06:07.714,"You didn't use our names, did you?"
01:06:07.714,01:06:10.007,"No, we didn't."
01:06:07.714,01:06:12.218,"If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you tell him?"
01:06:10.007,01:06:14.471,"No, I'm-- No. He's in on some scheme here."
01:06:14.471,01:06:16.598,We think you should file a report.
01:06:16.598,01:06:19.726,"This way if anything turns up, we got it on record."
01:06:19.726,01:06:22.270,"Take a card, give us a call, have a good day."
01:06:22.270,01:06:24.147,Thank you.
01:06:24.147,01:06:26.900,I don't know how we're...
01:06:26.900,01:06:29.235,Where is Ted when all this stuff is happening?
01:06:29.235,01:06:33.156,"Ted, he's got his date with Marcia Fox tonight."
01:06:33.156,01:06:35.450,He's probably out buying Spanish fly.
01:06:35.450,01:06:37.744,I think Helen Moss might be in on this.
01:06:37.744,01:06:40.121,I don't want to know about this.
01:06:40.121,01:06:43.333,I think we should change our lives. We should move out.
01:06:43.333,01:06:45.126,"Start over, maybe in Mexico."
01:06:45.126,01:06:48.505,Sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car.
01:06:50.089,01:06:52.425,CAROL: I'm just beginning to come down.
01:06:52.425,01:06:54.761,I don't know what's happening.
01:06:54.761,01:06:59.349,It was like a show where you open the door and see a dead body.
01:06:59.349,01:07:02.853,I've never seen a dead person before in my life.
01:07:02.853,01:07:06.189,"The only one I ever saw was my Uncle Morris, who was 94."
01:07:06.189,01:07:09.317,He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereal.
01:07:09.317,01:07:14.781,"Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened to us in our whole marriage?"
01:07:14.781,01:07:16.741,"This is too exciting, I don't need this."
01:07:16.741,01:07:23.414,"I'd like a fishing trip or Father's Day, or the time we saw Bing Crosby on Fifth Ave."
01:07:23.414,01:07:26.501,I don't need a murder to enliven my life at all.
01:07:26.501,01:07:31.631,"You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room while we were there, probably hiding."
01:07:31.631,01:07:34.467,Make sure and tell me that before I go to sleep tonight.
01:07:34.467,01:07:37.012,That means he probably saw us.
01:07:37.012,01:07:38.930,"Great, I'll never get my eyes closed."
01:07:38.930,01:07:41.182,What do you want me to do?
01:07:41.182,01:07:43.226,"Not only that, but I'm a little drunk."
01:07:43.226,01:07:45.102,I wonder who was cremated.
01:07:45.102,01:07:48.189,"Well, it was...obviously, it wasn't Mr. House."
01:07:48.189,01:07:50.567,He has an alibi.
01:07:50.567,01:07:53.695,She doesn't buy the alibi.
01:07:53.695,01:07:57.073,Let's get out of here.
01:07:58.950,01:08:00.785,"Jesus, it's starting to rain again."
01:08:00.785,01:08:04.121,If only Ted were with us.
01:08:04.121,01:08:06.917,"I know, Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve."
01:08:06.917,01:08:11.212,I think it's possible that hotel room was on the end of the hall.
01:08:11.212,01:08:13.006,"It's right up there, that's the room."
01:08:13.006,01:08:15.050,CAROL: I know.
01:08:13.006,01:08:17.427,What if they got the body out over that roof?
01:08:17.427,01:08:20.555,CAROL: What are the lights...?
01:08:20.555,01:08:23.391,"Yeah, that's eerie."
01:08:23.391,01:08:26.937,Let's call the police.
01:08:26.937,01:08:30.106,Check it out? Are you nuts?
01:08:30.106,01:08:32.358,"But, look, there's lights going on there."
01:08:32.358,01:08:34.736,"Yeah, I know, that's crazy."
01:08:32.358,01:08:37.781,"Why don't we go home and nap and call the police-- No, the police are red tape."
01:08:37.781,01:08:40.533,"Come on, this is my case."
01:08:40.533,01:08:42.911,I don't wanna do this.
01:08:42.911,01:08:45.663,If only Ted were with us.
01:08:45.663,01:08:47.290,Ted would be shaking in his boots.
01:08:47.290,01:08:49.292,I'm only trembling like a leaf.
01:08:51.628,01:08:53.004,"CAROL: Um, excuse me."
01:08:53.004,01:08:54.965,We're with the police department.
01:08:54.965,01:08:57.300,"We'd like to check out room 611, please."
01:08:57.300,01:09:00.261,You were here before.
01:09:00.261,01:09:03.640,You are police?
01:09:03.640,01:09:06.101,My what?
01:09:06.101,01:09:08.603,Your police identification card.
01:09:08.603,01:09:11.648,He's got his card.
01:09:12.983,01:09:16.111,Okay.
01:09:16.111,01:09:18.362,"Okay, great."
01:09:18.362,01:09:20.531,Is there any trouble?
01:09:20.531,01:09:21.783,I'm a detective.
01:09:21.783,01:09:23.994,They lowered the height requirement.
01:09:23.994,01:09:26.621,I'll take this card back.
01:09:37.132,01:09:39.300,CAROL: Okay.
01:09:39.300,01:09:41.803,LARRY: Be careful.
01:09:43.471,01:09:46.766,"Now, just don't upset anything."
01:09:46.766,01:09:51.604,"I'm just gonna leave a set of fingerprints, so if there's a trial, we can get trapped."
01:09:51.604,01:09:55.316,The murderer must have hid in this closet.
01:09:55.316,01:09:57.193,I don't like this.
01:09:57.193,01:09:59.654,"I gotta be up early tomorrow, I gotta be in temple."
01:09:59.654,01:10:12.333,He must have dragged the body out really fast-- I-I'm so sorry!
01:10:12.333,01:10:18.173,"The maid. Oh-- You don't have to turn the bed out, it's not necessary."
01:10:18.173,01:10:20.008,And no croissants for breakfast.
01:10:20.008,01:10:21.926,"Here, take this for yourself."
01:10:21.926,01:10:24.179,Keep the mints coming on the pillows.
01:10:24.179,01:10:26.890,"Honey, really."
01:10:26.890,01:10:28.766,That's why the light was on.
01:10:28.766,01:10:31.186,This is crazy.
01:10:31.186,01:10:33.270,Let me look around here a little bit.
01:10:33.270,01:10:35.439,I did damage. l...
01:10:36.774,01:10:38.818,CAROL: Larry!
01:10:38.818,01:10:42.321,"Larry, look. Look."
01:10:42.321,01:10:44.199,How do you know?
01:10:44.199,01:10:46.367,I saw it on her. Yeah.
01:10:46.367,01:10:49.954,"Jesus, so much for the police combing this place."
01:10:49.954,01:10:52.916,Where'd you find it?
01:10:52.916,01:10:56.086,"Let's get out of here, come on."
01:10:56.086,01:10:58.713,Maybe there's a pawnshop open.
01:11:02.092,01:11:04.802,Didn't I tell you the police weren't very thorough.
01:11:04.802,01:11:06.763,They probably thought we were cranks.
01:11:06.763,01:11:08.598,"I mean, we got no body."
01:11:08.598,01:11:11.101,They must get 50 crisis calls a minute.
01:11:11.101,01:11:13.394,Why would they bother with us?
01:11:11.101,01:11:15.146,"I don't know, I just know this is very deep stuff."
01:11:15.146,01:11:17.732,"We should not be here, I'm scared. This is creepy."
01:11:17.732,01:11:21.152,Who knows who's involved?
01:11:21.152,01:11:23.571,This could be like the Warren Commission.
01:11:23.571,01:11:24.864,I don't like it.
01:11:26.365,01:11:28.284,"Oh, my God!"
01:11:28.284,01:11:31.162,The elevator's probably stuck.
01:11:31.162,01:11:33.414,Relax.
01:11:33.414,01:11:35.708,I'm a world-renowned claustrophobic.
01:11:35.708,01:11:37.919,"It's okay, it's gonna be fine."
01:11:37.919,01:11:40.713,I don't like this.
01:11:40.713,01:11:43.716,"It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic."
01:11:43.716,01:11:46.761,The idea is there's plenty of air in this elevator.
01:11:46.761,01:11:48.846,"Just don't panic, okay?"
01:11:48.846,01:11:51.599,I'm not panicking.
01:11:51.599,01:11:53.768,I'm gonna say the rosary now.
01:11:53.768,01:11:56.729,Somebody's gonna help us.
01:11:56.729,01:11:58.355,Hello?
01:11:58.355,01:12:00.441,Hello?
01:12:00.441,01:12:02.652,Hello!
01:12:02.652,01:12:05.655,"I'm running over a field, I see open meadows."
01:12:05.655,01:12:07.615,I see a stallion.
01:12:07.615,01:12:10.576,"Shut up, Larry. Larry, just shut up and calm down."
01:12:10.576,01:12:13.955,"I see grass, I see dirt."
01:12:13.955,01:12:17.292,"You said, Act like a policeman. I said no."
01:12:17.292,01:12:20.461,"You said, Show them your card."
01:12:20.461,01:12:22.839,"Larry, boost me up."
01:12:22.839,01:12:25.133,We'll do it.
01:12:25.133,01:12:27.718,It'll never open.
01:12:27.718,01:12:30.346,T-They never open.
01:12:27.718,01:12:32.307,"Come one, all right, put your hands together."
01:12:32.307,01:12:34.433,I'm breathing.
01:12:34.433,01:12:38.688,"Larry, I mean-- All I have to do is loosen that, okay?"
01:12:38.688,01:12:43.109,Put your hand together.
01:12:43.109,01:12:45.153,You ready?
01:12:45.153,01:12:47.989,"Jesus, you gotta cut down on those rich desserts."
01:12:47.989,01:12:51.492,"CAROL: Wait a minute, now!"
01:12:51.492,01:12:54.204,My life is passing in front of my eyes.
01:12:54.204,01:12:56.622,The worst part is I'm driving a used car.
01:12:56.622,01:12:58.833,CAROL: You'd think they'd loosen this thing.
01:12:58.833,01:13:03.629,"LARRY: I'm scared-- CAROL: Oh, my God!"
01:13:03.629,01:13:06.341,It's her!
01:13:06.341,01:13:08.885,Jesus! Claustrophobia and a dead body.
01:13:08.885,01:13:10.261,This is a neurotic's jackpot.
01:13:12.263,01:13:14.807,"CAROL: Larry, oh, I'm scared."
01:13:14.807,01:13:17.143,"CAROL: Oh, God, what's happening?"
01:13:17.143,01:13:20.355,LARRY: Press up? I can't see my hand!
01:13:20.355,01:13:22.565,CAROL: We must be heading for the basement.
01:13:22.565,01:13:26.027,LARRY: I want to get off on the mezzanine. I'm returning shoes.
01:13:27.695,01:13:30.240,LARRY: It's dark here.
01:13:30.240,01:13:33.243,LARRY: I'm getting back on the elevator. I can't see anything.
01:13:33.243,01:13:35.745,CAROL: There's nothing up here.
01:13:35.745,01:13:38.373,"CAROL: Hey, what are you doing with matches?"
01:13:38.373,01:13:40.750,LARRY: These are my matches.
01:13:40.750,01:13:43.502,CAROL: When were you at the Cafe des Artistes?
01:13:43.502,01:13:45.880,LARRY: I was with an authoress.
01:13:45.880,01:13:49.133,CAROL: At the Cafe des Artistes?
01:13:53.388,01:13:54.931,CAROL: Wait.
01:13:54.931,01:13:56.682,LARRY: Jesus.
01:13:56.682,01:13:59.894,I like a basement with knotty pine and a pool table.
01:13:59.894,01:14:02.313,"CAROL: Hey, look."
01:14:02.313,01:14:04.065,What's this?
01:14:04.065,01:14:06.984,"LARRY: Wait a minute, not so fast."
01:14:06.984,01:14:09.362,It's dank and there's strange noises.
01:14:09.362,01:14:13.991,"LARRY: I don't know what this is, I don't-- LARRY: Oh, Jesus!"
01:14:13.991,01:14:16.535,CAROL: Calm down.
01:14:16.535,01:14:19.372,Don't tell me to calm down.
01:14:19.372,01:14:21.416,Let me see.
01:14:23.209,01:14:25.420,We're locked in here.
01:14:25.420,01:14:27.504,"Relax, relax."
01:14:27.504,01:14:28.965,Stand back.
01:14:28.965,01:14:31.050,Don't hurt yourself.
01:14:32.802,01:14:34.553,Must be one of those new doors.
01:14:34.553,01:14:37.890,Over here.
01:14:41.811,01:14:45.106,"LARRY: Oh, God."
01:14:45.106,01:14:48.151,CAROL: What's down there?
01:14:48.151,01:14:51.112,LARRY: Where are you going?
01:14:51.112,01:14:54.991,What? Oh! I think this is the service entrance.
01:14:54.991,01:14:58.619,"LARRY: Come on, get it open."
01:15:01.038,01:15:03.040,LARRY: Let's go.
01:15:04.834,01:15:06.543,Wait! Do you see that?
01:15:06.543,01:15:08.587,What?
01:15:06.543,01:15:11.466,Looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.
01:15:11.466,01:15:14.260,Yeah. Come on.
01:15:14.260,01:15:16.637,"CAROL: Oh, my God, wait."
01:15:16.637,01:15:18.973,LARRY: Let's get out of here.
01:15:18.973,01:15:21.851,Let's follow him. Come on.
01:15:21.851,01:15:23.894,"CAROL: There was a body in that car, Larry."
01:15:23.894,01:15:26.647,LARRY: I don't want to follow a car with a body in it.
01:15:26.647,01:15:29.400,CAROL: Hurry up!
01:15:26.647,01:15:32.236,LARRY: It's probably a rented car and a rented body.
01:15:55.176,01:15:58.762,"LARRY: Oh, Jesus."
01:15:58.762,01:16:01.474,CAROL: But he's right up ahead.
01:16:01.474,01:16:03.642,I don't know which car I'm following here.
01:16:03.642,01:16:06.020,I'm not a good driver.
01:16:06.020,01:16:09.190,I'm gonna have an accident.
01:16:06.020,01:16:11.650,I'll wind up hitting a school bus or something.
01:16:09.190,01:16:13.569,"CAROL: It's night time, There's no school buses at night."
01:16:13.569,01:16:16.406,LARRY: Don't tell me that.
01:16:22.870,01:16:24.997,LARRY: You have no sense of direction.
01:16:24.997,01:16:27.417,CAROL: I have 20/20 vision.
01:16:27.417,01:16:30.920,LARRY: No sense of direction.
01:16:30.920,01:16:32.922,LARRY: Where are we?
01:16:32.922,01:16:35.591,CAROL: There it is!
01:16:35.591,01:16:38.094,CAROL: That's his car.
01:16:38.094,01:16:40.221,CAROL: Let's get out.
01:16:38.094,01:16:42.432,"LARRY: Be careful, let me turn the lights off."
01:17:36.319,01:17:38.488,Look! Look!
01:17:39.863,01:17:43.618,"LARRY: Oh, my God!"
01:17:46.537,01:17:49.790,Come on! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped!
01:17:55.129,01:17:57.006,"CAROL: Oh, my God."
01:17:59.925,01:18:02.553,"LARRY: Goodbye, Mrs. House."
01:18:26.536,01:18:28.037,That was Mr. House!
01:18:28.037,01:18:30.998,That was definitely Mr. House!
01:18:33.626,01:18:37.171,I'm gonna call the police now.
01:18:37.171,01:18:42.468,"I mean, this guy's got proof his wife died of a heart attack two weeks ago."
01:18:42.468,01:18:44.637,We've got no body.
01:18:44.637,01:18:46.389,What? What's wrong?
01:18:48.765,01:18:50.309,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
01:18:50.309,01:18:52.687,"Hello, there. How are you?"
01:18:52.687,01:18:55.231,How are you?
01:18:52.687,01:18:56.607,"May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday?"
01:18:56.607,01:18:58.817,"This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors."
01:18:58.817,01:19:00.570,We're just watching Madame Bovary.
01:19:00.570,01:19:03.406,Such a sad story.
01:19:03.406,01:19:06.116,S-She gets cremated-- killed at the end.
01:19:06.116,01:19:08.911,You gotta stop up for a drink before I go on my trip.
01:19:08.911,01:19:10.705,Love to.
01:19:10.705,01:19:16.168,"Incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an apartment, I think I may be moving."
01:19:16.168,01:19:18.588,"See you later. Come on, Gladys."
01:19:18.588,01:19:20.464,Good night.
01:19:25.010,01:19:28.889,"Oh, Jesus, what a day, huh?"
01:19:28.889,01:19:32.643,I can't figure it out.
01:19:32.643,01:19:34.520,It's got to be that...
01:19:34.520,01:19:36.188,either he's a...
01:19:36.188,01:19:39.024,Either she's a twin or he's a twin.
01:19:39.024,01:19:40.276,He...
01:19:40.276,01:19:43.070,Or they're multiple personalities.
01:19:43.070,01:19:45.322,Or you're a twin or I'm a twin.
01:19:47.366,01:19:51.621,Because I don't know what's going on.
01:19:51.621,01:19:53.830,You know? Look.
01:19:53.830,01:19:56.041,Let me be logical about this.
01:19:56.041,01:19:57.960,"Okay, we know she's not a twin."
01:19:57.960,01:20:00.463,What are you talking about?
01:19:57.960,01:20:02.214,"Stay calm, I want to try and puzzle this out."
01:20:02.214,01:20:04.967,"Okay, she's a twin, she's not a twin."
01:20:04.967,01:20:07.553,Now you're saying we're twins?
01:20:07.553,01:20:10.097,"What are you, nuts?"
01:20:10.097,01:20:12.015,I'm calm. Okay.
01:20:12.015,01:20:14.851,"Yeah, I'm going to be logical."
01:20:14.851,01:20:20.483,"The first thing is this: We came home that night, there had been a heart attack."
01:20:20.483,01:20:23.444,What if they induced it?
01:20:23.444,01:20:26.530,We never saw the body.
01:20:26.530,01:20:31.494,Some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.
01:20:31.494,01:20:33.870,"The super says he saw her, but he's a drunk."
01:20:33.870,01:20:36.165,Mrs. House could have been hiding.
01:20:36.165,01:20:39.418,Remember you heard a noise that night.
01:20:39.418,01:20:44.799,That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.
01:20:44.799,01:20:47.343,"I can't sleep, I just..."
01:20:44.799,01:20:49.470,"Wait a minute, it doesn't make any sense at all."
01:20:49.470,01:20:51.888,Suddenly he murders her.
01:20:51.888,01:20:58.521,"Let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey, why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia, get something to eat and talk with them?"
01:20:58.521,01:21:00.230,At 1:00 am?
01:21:00.230,01:21:03.192,Ted was taking her to a show and dinner.
01:21:03.192,01:21:09.865,"You want to schlep all the way to New Jersey-- This is a town never sleeps, that's why we don't live in Duluth."
01:21:09.865,01:21:12.117,"Plus, I don't know where Duluth is."
01:21:12.117,01:21:13.828,Lucky me.
01:21:13.828,01:21:17.289,You really saw his face?
01:21:17.289,01:21:19.416,I'm here to tell you...
01:21:19.416,01:21:22.294,Not a question.
01:21:22.294,01:21:25.381,There was no way you could avoid it. He was right there.
01:21:25.381,01:21:28.884,"To me, it's obvious."
01:21:28.884,01:21:31.136,Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.
01:21:31.136,01:21:33.930,"Why, how? What do you mean?"
01:21:33.930,01:21:38.769,You have to start off with another woman who bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.
01:21:38.769,01:21:40.479,That's what I said!
01:21:38.769,01:21:42.773,I used the term ballpark resemblance myself.
01:21:40.479,01:21:44.441,"It was my idea, They're with this woman."
01:21:44.441,01:21:46.610,MARCIA: Maybe having dinner.
01:21:46.610,01:21:49.905,"They don't induce a heart attack, 'cause that's fiction bullshit."
01:21:49.905,01:21:53.200,She has a heart attack.
01:21:53.200,01:21:57.788,"They had no thought of killing her, maybe they wished she was dead."
01:21:57.788,01:22:00.791,"MARCIA: I don't know, maybe they stood to gain if she died."
01:22:00.791,01:22:02.835,They see a golden opportunity.
01:22:02.835,01:22:05.546,"Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes, she hides."
01:22:05.546,01:22:07.798,"LARRY: This is my theory, exactly my theory ."
01:22:07.798,01:22:10.217,MARCIA: That's right.
01:22:10.217,01:22:13.387,"Well we got that far, with the exception of the heart attack."
01:22:13.387,01:22:16.932,The husband's planning to go to Paris with this young woman.
01:22:16.932,01:22:19.351,LARRY &amp; TED: Yeah.
01:22:19.351,01:22:25.148,"So instead of finishing this scheme they planned, he double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the profits."
01:22:25.148,01:22:27.109,You think Helen Moss is in on this too?
01:22:27.109,01:22:29.945,"Yeah, good chance she's aware."
01:22:29.945,01:22:31.822,He claims he took her to the movies.
01:22:31.822,01:22:33.449,She's his alibi.
01:22:33.449,01:22:35.785,She covered for him when he strangled his wife.
01:22:35.785,01:22:37.286,She said he was at work all day.
01:22:37.286,01:22:39.329,He introduced her as a colleague.
01:22:39.329,01:22:40.915,A colleague who maybe loves him.
01:22:40.915,01:22:42.374,Oh!
01:22:42.374,01:22:44.585,Cheating on two women?
01:22:44.585,01:22:46.796,This guy doesn't look the part.
01:22:46.796,01:22:49.506,The point is he's gotten away with the perfect murder.
01:22:49.506,01:22:53.886,"There are no bodies around, to prove anything and all the paperwork's strictly aboveboard."
01:22:53.886,01:22:56.179,He's home free.
01:22:56.179,01:22:58.432,She's a genius.
01:22:56.179,01:23:01.435,"She's brilliant. But the guy, he knows that we know-- He doesn't care. Why should he?"
01:23:01.435,01:23:04.146,"Everything's been neatly disposed of, he's home free."
01:23:04.146,01:23:07.190,"Only he, and maybe his mistress, know the truth."
01:23:07.190,01:23:09.652,"She's right, there's no body."
01:23:07.190,01:23:11.361,"Hold on, We don't know this is all true."
01:23:11.361,01:23:12.947,This is just a theory.
01:23:12.947,01:23:15.073,"Yeah, but it's a great theory."
01:23:15.073,01:23:17.534,A great theory.
01:23:17.534,01:23:19.703,I think it's great.
01:23:19.703,01:23:23.248,"When I come back from the ladies' room, I'll tell you how to trap him."
01:23:25.083,01:23:27.336,Unbelievable.
01:23:27.336,01:23:30.422,She's really something.
01:23:27.336,01:23:32.424,"Like one idea after another, one thing leads to another."
01:23:32.424,01:23:35.302,I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourselves to death.
01:23:35.302,01:23:37.346,We just had a nice first date.
01:23:37.346,01:23:39.556,LARRY: I knew they would hit it off.
01:23:39.556,01:23:43.519,What about you? You were gonna jump into her lap.
01:23:43.519,01:23:45.771,What are you talking about?
01:23:45.771,01:23:47.731,"What's wrong with you, I'm her editor."
01:23:47.731,01:23:49.483,I'm a father figure to her.
01:23:49.483,01:23:52.361,The only thing you didn't do is rub your hands together.
01:23:52.361,01:23:53.696,You've gotta be joking.
01:23:53.696,01:23:55.781,You're telling me you're jealous of Marcia?
01:23:55.781,01:23:57.658,CAROL: It's not that I'm jealous.
01:23:57.658,01:24:00.494,TED: What are we doing here?
01:24:00.494,01:24:03.956,You kept staring into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady.
01:24:03.956,01:24:06.667,You're jealous because he's interested in her?
01:24:06.667,01:24:07.918,I am not jealous.
01:24:07.918,01:24:09.670,TED: I'm interested in her theory.
01:24:09.670,01:24:13.674,"Do you take all your authors to lunch at-- Okay, I've got it."
01:24:15.634,01:24:17.344,Here's the story.
01:24:17.344,01:24:20.014,"Since he's gotten away with it, all we can do is bluff."
01:24:20.014,01:24:22.850,"As long as we have no body, we have no case."
01:24:22.850,01:24:25.811,What do you mean?
01:24:22.850,01:24:28.438,We pretend he slipped up and the molten steel didn't do the job?
01:24:28.438,01:24:30.816,"MARCIA: Yeah, it's possible."
01:24:30.816,01:24:32.442,He knows you're onto him.
01:24:32.442,01:24:35.029,"After he ran away, why couldn't you retrieve the body?"
01:24:35.029,01:24:37.113,We couldn't have gotten her out of there.
01:24:37.113,01:24:39.700,I would've wound up with a few toes and a shoulder.
01:24:39.700,01:24:41.827,"Okay, you have the body."
01:24:41.827,01:24:44.830,He was probably too scared to be very lucid. He's an amateur.
01:24:44.830,01:24:49.418,"He dumped the body and ran off, and then somehow, who knows the details, you two dug her out."
01:24:49.418,01:24:51.086,Now you can send him to the chair.
01:24:51.086,01:24:52.922,I like this woman.
01:24:52.922,01:24:55.465,Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us.
01:24:55.465,01:24:58.510,"First of all, because I can't bluff or lie without giggling."
01:24:58.510,01:25:01.597,"CAROL: No, because if we really had the body, why tell him?"
01:25:01.597,01:25:04.099,Why not go straight to the police?
01:25:04.099,01:25:06.476,"If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down."
01:25:06.476,01:25:10.773,"TED: Oh, she's wicked."
01:25:10.773,01:25:13.483,"You go to the law, what do you gain?"
01:25:13.483,01:25:16.403,Maybe they put him in jail.
01:25:16.403,01:25:18.781,You haven't got anything.
01:25:18.781,01:25:23.869,"But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it, now he's nervous, right?"
01:25:21.784,01:25:26.496,"No, wait, there's just so many fallacies in this."
01:25:26.496,01:25:28.791,TED: What? Name one.
01:25:28.791,01:25:33.670,The guy looks us straight in the eye and says: What body? What are you talking about? Prove it.
01:25:33.670,01:25:36.298,That's when we keep bluffing.
01:25:36.298,01:25:38.675,We produce the body.
01:25:38.675,01:25:41.511,Madame Tussauds?
01:25:38.675,01:25:44.056,"Say we found someone to corroborate the story, someone he trusted."
01:25:44.056,01:25:46.016,CAROL: Like who?
01:25:46.016,01:25:50.479,"Say she called and said, Paul, I've just seen Lillian's body. They want $100,000 for it."
01:25:50.479,01:25:52.731,Why would she do that?
01:25:52.731,01:25:59.029,"Remember that book you recommended to me, Murder in Manhattan?"
01:25:59.029,01:26:01.657,"That's right, the phone call."
01:25:59.029,01:26:03.951,"CAROL: I don't remember that book, you never mentioned that book to me."
01:26:03.951,01:26:05.702,'Cause you don't like light reading.
01:26:05.702,01:26:07.746,Since when?
01:26:07.746,01:26:10.206,It's fantastic!
01:26:07.746,01:26:16.588,"It would be so perfect, because she's an actress, a would-be actress, and we could use his theater."
01:26:16.588,01:26:19.800,"This is so perfect. Your theater is empty all the time, anyhow."
01:26:19.800,01:26:23.804,Thank you. That's great.
01:26:23.804,01:26:35.983,"What you do is, we get her in for a fake audition, and you write some lines that don't mean anything and she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing, and we tape-record it. Listen."
01:26:35.983,01:26:42.990,And then we edit the tape recording up and we make one end of a phone call and play it to Mr. House.
01:26:42.990,01:26:44.825,This is in the book?
01:26:44.825,01:26:47.786,This is perfect.
01:26:47.786,01:26:50.413,You don't know what he's gonna say.
01:26:50.413,01:26:52.749,"In the book, they use several recorders."
01:26:52.749,01:26:54.584,We coordinate it.
01:26:54.584,01:26:57.754,You're basing your plan on some dumb paperback?
01:26:57.754,01:26:59.673,This is great.
01:26:59.673,01:27:01.508,MARCIA: He's gotten away with murder.
01:27:01.508,01:27:06.596,"Our only chance is to nab him as he tries to kill again, to cover his tracks."
01:27:04.260,01:27:09.516,LARRY: What happens is it provokes him to kill again.
01:27:09.516,01:27:11.935,MARCIA: He's gotten away with the first murder.
01:27:11.935,01:27:15.022,You know what I'm thinking?
01:27:11.935,01:27:18.775,"In the book what happens is, he kills the two people working the scheme on him."
01:27:18.775,01:27:21.319,TED: But you're not worried about that.
01:27:21.319,01:27:22.779,It's perfect.
01:27:22.779,01:27:25.574,"Either that, or I've developed Parkinson's."
01:27:25.574,01:27:27.450,"TED: No, we can handle him."
01:27:27.450,01:27:30.204,"It's perfect. He knows you're onto him, shake him down."
01:27:30.204,01:27:32.247,"He comes after you, we nab him."
01:27:32.247,01:27:34.332,It's great.
01:27:34.332,01:27:36.501,It's either that or he walks.
01:27:36.501,01:27:45.886,"So what you're saying is-- No, What you're saying-- Oh, boy. You're saying you wanna provoke Mr. House into trying to murder Larry and me."
01:27:45.886,01:27:48.471,Yeah. It's perfect.
01:27:48.471,01:27:52.267,"No, no, I'm not scared."
01:27:52.267,01:27:55.520,I just want to check with my clergyman before we commit.
01:27:55.520,01:28:00.400,"Hi, B-24, messages?"
01:28:00.400,01:28:03.237,Audition for what?
01:28:03.237,01:28:07.282,"Okay, okay. Wait, hold on."
01:28:07.282,01:28:09.409,Okay.
01:28:09.409,01:28:12.537,"Yeah, well, I've heard just about enough of this."
01:28:12.537,01:28:15.373,"Good, that's great."
01:28:15.373,01:28:17.876,We'll let you know.
01:28:17.876,01:28:20.170,Good. Thank you.
01:28:22.005,01:28:24.382,This is Helen Moss.
01:28:25.884,01:28:27.636,"Uh, have you..."
01:28:27.636,01:28:35.852,"I know you just got the material just in the last little while, have you had a chance to study, to go over it?"
01:28:35.852,01:28:38.981,"Yes, I have, but I have just a few questions."
01:28:38.981,01:28:40.356,"TED: Sure, yeah."
01:28:40.356,01:28:41.817,Is she divorced in this?
01:28:41.817,01:28:44.278,TED: Yes. Yes.
01:28:44.278,01:28:47.781,Recently?
01:28:47.781,01:28:50.700,But she's-- It's highly emotional.
01:28:50.700,01:28:53.036,"You know, really, a lot of..."
01:28:53.036,01:28:56.665,a lot of feeling.
01:28:56.665,01:29:00.335,Shall I just begin?
01:29:00.335,01:29:02.087,Mmm...
01:29:12.347,01:29:14.641,"Hello, Joe?"
01:29:12.347,01:29:17.435,"I was just-- TED: Let me stop you right there, sorry."
01:29:17.435,01:29:22.482,"If you'll start out more frightened, that will take you where you're gonna go."
01:29:22.482,01:29:24.067,"Right, right."
01:29:29.072,01:29:30.406,"Hello, Joe?"
01:29:32.575,01:29:36.621,"I can't talk much now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed."
01:29:36.621,01:29:39.541,Give me your hand.
01:29:39.541,01:29:42.002,Try not to fall.
01:29:42.002,01:29:44.963,"I'm trying, I'm trying."
01:29:44.963,01:29:49.092,"They're asking $200,000 for it. Yeah."
01:29:49.092,01:29:51.970,"They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake."
01:29:51.970,01:30:01.063,"HELEN: Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on everything."
01:30:05.942,01:30:08.528,"Hello, Joe?"
01:30:08.528,01:30:13.200,"I can't talk much right now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed."
01:30:16.828,01:30:18.914,"Hello, Joe?"
01:30:18.914,01:30:20.790,I can't talk much right now...
01:30:23.501,01:30:27.214,"Hello, Joe?"
01:30:27.214,01:30:32.010,Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam he's cast a pall on everything.
01:30:32.010,01:30:34.470,A dark cloud. A pall.
01:30:34.470,01:30:36.556,A pall.
01:30:38.058,01:30:39.559,Pall.
01:30:39.559,01:30:41.728,Pall.
01:30:42.938,01:30:45.690,"Hello, Joe?"
01:31:05.043,01:31:07.087,"Hello, Paul?"
01:31:07.087,01:31:11.591,"I can't talk much right now, and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed."
01:31:11.591,01:31:15.095,Perfect. Great. Great.
01:31:15.095,01:31:18.223,That's great.
01:31:18.223,01:31:19.515,It's fantastic.
01:31:20.809,01:31:22.644,MARCIA: There she is.
01:31:22.644,01:31:24.687,MARCIA: Keep her busy all afternoon.
01:31:24.687,01:31:26.731,TED: I'll just keep improvising.
01:31:26.731,01:31:29.483,MARCIA: It shouldn't be hard.
01:31:29.483,01:31:34.781,"I'll talk about the play, get her talking about the part, her life, and her whole background. Stop the car."
01:31:34.781,01:31:36.950,We'll hook up later.
01:31:36.950,01:31:38.492,You too.
01:31:38.492,01:31:42.122,"MARILYN: Listen, does anybody want some guacamole?"
01:31:42.122,01:31:44.874,"Stop with the guacamole, we have to get started."
01:31:44.874,01:31:47.043,It's 2:30.
01:31:47.043,01:31:50.546,"MARILYN: All right, let's go."
01:31:50.546,01:31:53.258,"LARRY: All right, one second."
01:31:53.258,01:31:55.551,So we're on speaker.
01:31:55.551,01:31:58.388,CAROL: This is so insane.
01:31:58.388,01:32:00.182,LARRY: I'm not nervous.
01:32:00.182,01:32:04.269,The contractor came and nobody's here. See if-- I'll get that.
01:32:04.269,01:32:06.520,You go and call him.
01:32:12.694,01:32:14.612,Hello?
01:32:14.612,01:32:18.200,"Hello, Paul."
01:32:18.200,01:32:22.037,"And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed."
01:32:22.037,01:32:24.373,What's the problem?
01:32:24.373,01:32:28.251,They have your wife's body.
01:32:29.878,01:32:31.213,Say that again.
01:32:36.801,01:32:39.637,They have your wife's body.
01:32:39.637,01:32:41.973,Exactly who has it?
01:32:41.973,01:32:46.936,Your neighbors. That's right.
01:32:46.936,01:32:49.689,Where are you calling from?
01:32:49.689,01:32:51.316,Are you on a speakerphone?
01:32:53.402,01:32:55.195,Hold on.
01:32:55.195,01:32:56.738,We don't have an answer for that.
01:32:56.738,01:32:59.991,Go to a different thought.
01:32:56.738,01:33:03.995,"What thought? Wait-- You either gotta pay them off, or get rid of them."
01:33:03.995,01:33:06.498,We can't talk on the phone.
01:33:06.498,01:33:09.459,Yes! They're keeping it refrigerated.
01:33:09.459,01:33:11.961,What? What did you say?
01:33:11.961,01:33:14.047,HELEN: About two hours ago.
01:33:14.047,01:33:16.758,Two? What?
01:33:18.676,01:33:20.178,HELEN: Hold on.
01:33:20.178,01:33:22.347,I got this all screwed up.
01:33:22.347,01:33:24.391,Let's get off quick.
01:33:24.391,01:33:26.393,All right. Do something.
01:33:27.477,01:33:28.686,"Okay, shh."
01:33:30.688,01:33:34.192,"HELEN: Hello, Paul."
01:33:34.192,01:33:36.986,"And if I sound strange, don't get alarmed."
01:33:36.986,01:33:39.281,"Look, Helen, you're not making any sense."
01:33:39.281,01:33:41.575,"I know you're upset, but pull yourself together."
01:33:41.575,01:33:43.159,"Now, can we meet?"
01:33:43.159,01:33:44.869,HELEN: Hold on.
01:33:46.162,01:33:49.165,Helen?
01:33:49.165,01:33:50.959,Helen?
01:33:50.959,01:33:52.961,"Okay, hurry up."
01:33:52.961,01:33:56.506,Somebody press something.
01:33:56.506,01:33:59.050,"HELEN: You have no choice, they've got the goods."
01:33:59.050,01:34:03.179,"Just pay them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up."
01:34:20.905,01:34:23.575,"What's the matter, Paul?"
01:34:23.575,01:34:24.993,I'm okay.
01:34:24.993,01:34:26.702,"I worry about you these days, Paul."
01:34:26.702,01:34:29.331,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
01:34:29.331,01:34:32.208,I said I was fine.
01:34:32.208,01:34:36.004,You never used to pull away from me-- I told you to leave me alone!
01:34:36.004,01:34:39.048,I don't want to have this conversation all the time!
01:34:45.721,01:34:52.020,LARRY: My job is to wait exactly one hour and call Mr. House from a phone booth.
01:34:52.020,01:34:53.771,I have to go home and change.
01:34:53.771,01:34:57.691,I've got an appointment...
01:34:57.691,01:34:59.861,What do you mean?
01:34:57.691,01:35:02.489,I just don't understand how you could give a book to Marcia and not to me?
01:35:02.489,01:35:05.325,What are you talking about?
01:35:05.325,01:35:07.327,Marcia likes to read what I like to read.
01:35:07.327,01:35:10.163,I guess it's true.
01:35:07.327,01:35:12.457,"We've got nothing in common, that's for sure."
01:35:10.163,01:35:15.210,"Now that Nick's grown, we're just left facing each other."
01:35:15.210,01:35:17.546,"You've got stuff in common with Ted, right?"
01:35:17.546,01:35:20.882,"You can cook together, take your clothes off and baste a chicken."
01:35:20.882,01:35:23.677,What about Marcia? What does she teach you besides poker?
01:35:23.677,01:35:25.887,Mud wrestling.
01:35:25.887,01:35:28.682,"Nothing, I'm her editor."
01:35:25.887,01:35:31.267,I think the time has come for us to re-evaluate our lives.
01:35:31.267,01:35:32.852,"I got a ten, you got a six."
01:35:32.852,01:35:35.813,CAROL: Maybe I'll go back to see my shrink.
01:35:35.813,01:35:37.731,LARRY: You don't have to see a shrink.
01:35:37.731,01:35:43.071,There's nothing's wrong with you that can't be cured with Prozac and a polo mallet.
01:35:40.360,01:35:46.740,"I would like to be alone for a while, okay, Larry?"
01:35:48.326,01:35:50.870,So I have this crazy father.
01:35:50.870,01:35:53.498,"TED: Oh, yeah?"
01:35:53.498,01:35:55.208,He has a terrible driving record.
01:35:55.208,01:35:57.544,So we had to move from Virginia to New Jersey.
01:35:57.544,01:35:59.504,Your father is wanted for driving?
01:35:59.504,01:36:02.090,Yeah.
01:36:02.090,01:36:04.342,"Anyway, I was in all these different contests."
01:36:04.342,01:36:07.011,And I was even Miss Teenage Passaic.
01:36:07.011,01:36:08.888,"Oh, how wonderful."
01:36:47.302,01:36:50.221,Was that before or after the fourth abortion?
01:36:50.221,01:36:52.932,"Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize."
01:36:52.932,01:36:54.350,Drama prize?
01:36:54.350,01:36:56.227,I don't remember...
01:36:56.227,01:36:58.020,"Out, out, damned spot?"
01:36:58.020,01:37:01.483,The topless Macbeth?
01:37:01.483,01:37:03.485,Yeah.
01:37:01.483,01:37:05.361,"Topless Macbeth, how could I forget that?"
01:37:17.039,01:37:20.502,"Hello, Mr. House?"
01:37:20.502,01:37:24.506,I got a package I think you're gonna want.
01:37:24.506,01:37:31.721,"Of course, it's gonna cost you $200,000 in small, unmarked bills."
01:37:31.721,01:37:36.810,"Or large, marked ones, if you want to go that route."
01:37:36.810,01:37:39.187,"And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton."
01:37:39.187,01:37:42.148,"If you ever want to see your wife alive, do as I say."
01:37:42.148,01:37:43.983,Really?
01:37:43.983,01:37:45.819,"Well, I think you're bluffing."
01:37:45.819,01:37:48.196,Don't ever try and bluff a bluffer.
01:37:48.196,01:37:50.699,"If you've got Carol, put her on the phone."
01:37:53.075,01:37:56.912,"Larry, help me!"
01:37:53.075,01:38:01.959,"I'm here, Larry-- Oh, my God."
01:38:01.959,01:38:03.877,I'll tell you exactly where to meet me.
01:38:03.877,01:38:07.048,You bring that package I want.
01:38:03.877,01:38:09.634,"Once I have it and I'm gone, you get your wife back."
01:38:09.634,01:38:13.137,"Yes, yes."
01:38:13.137,01:38:16.599,I'll be there.
01:38:13.137,01:38:19.644,"I'll be there. Yes, I'll bring your wife's body, in the trunk of my car."
01:38:19.644,01:38:22.438,"Yes, I promise, I'll be there."
01:38:24.315,01:38:26.984,I don't have his wife's body.
01:38:26.984,01:38:29.237,"Bluff, bluff."
01:38:46.254,01:38:49.006,Where's Carol?
01:38:49.006,01:38:51.426,I got it.
01:38:49.006,01:38:53.595,There's no way she could've survived that vat of molten steel.
01:38:51.426,01:38:56.097,"No-- lf you're not bluffing, where is she?"
01:38:56.097,01:38:58.641,Why are you so nervous?
01:38:58.641,01:39:01.352,Where is she?
01:39:01.352,01:39:03.563,Open it. Now.
01:39:01.352,01:39:06.107,"If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head, now open it."
01:39:06.107,01:39:07.901,Come on. Come on!
01:39:09.778,01:39:11.279,Step back.
01:39:11.279,01:39:13.740,"No, I got her."
01:39:11.279,01:39:15.116,"If I don't have her, how come I got her ring?"
01:39:15.116,01:39:17.911,I think you're lying!
01:39:22.582,01:39:24.793,What's this?
01:39:24.793,01:39:26.878,I've lost a fortune in cards.
01:39:26.878,01:39:29.422,Listen to me-- I'm not a bluffer.
01:39:38.640,01:39:40.809,That's what Grisby thought.
01:39:40.809,01:39:46.188,"But of course, she meant to kill Grisby too after he'd served his purpose."
01:39:46.188,01:39:48.608,He never even did that.
01:39:48.608,01:39:51.277,And that was not part of the plan.
01:39:51.277,01:39:53.947,Broome might have got to the police before he died.
01:39:53.947,01:40:05.959,"And if the cops traced it to Grisby, and the cops made Grisby talk, he'd spill everything and she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby, but quick."
01:40:05.959,01:40:07.710,And I was the fall guy.
01:40:37.323,01:40:40.075,Why don't you try to understand?
01:40:40.075,01:40:44.037,He was mad.
01:40:44.037,01:40:45.915,And what about me?
01:40:45.915,01:40:48.584,We could've gone off together.
01:40:48.584,01:40:53.506,"One who follows his nature, keeps-- LARRY: Help! Help!"
01:40:53.506,01:40:56.467,They can't see us behind the screen.
01:40:56.467,01:40:58.803,And they can't hear us with the sound on.
01:40:58.803,01:41:01.054,Not even a gunshot.
01:41:01.054,01:41:02.891,"Hello, Paul."
01:41:02.891,01:41:06.143,Didn't you expect me?
01:41:06.143,01:41:08.897,You made a lot of promises to me over the years.
01:41:08.897,01:41:14.151,And then you decided to dump me for that young model.
01:41:14.151,01:41:17.405,PAUL: I never led you on.
01:41:17.405,01:41:19.156,None of you can prove anything.
01:41:19.156,01:41:24.077,...So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.
01:41:24.077,01:41:25.955,Carol! Carol.
01:41:24.077,01:41:31.586,"With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell, but you are aiming at me, aren't you?"
01:41:31.586,01:41:35.130,"Of course, killing you is killing myself."
01:41:35.130,01:41:38.885,"But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us."
01:42:02.951,01:42:04.953,I'm so glad.
01:42:04.953,01:42:06.871,"Oh, God, Larry!"
01:42:06.871,01:42:08.873,"Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you!"
01:42:08.873,01:42:11.124,I was never so glad to see somebody in my life.
01:42:11.124,01:42:13.126,Get me out.
01:42:13.126,01:42:15.630,You don't know what's going on out there.
01:42:15.630,01:42:18.340,I'll never say life that doesn't imitate art again.
01:42:18.340,01:42:21.719,We gotta call the police.
01:42:21.719,01:42:24.305,"I know. Oh, God."
01:42:24.305,01:42:26.181,Dial. I know. Larry.
01:42:26.181,01:42:28.434,"Oh, Larry, oh, God, Larry."
01:42:28.434,01:42:32.396,"Oh, God."
01:42:32.396,01:42:34.065,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
01:42:34.065,01:42:35.733,"Oh, wife mine."
01:42:35.733,01:42:37.359,"Oh, God."
01:42:39.487,01:42:43.825,"God, it's so complicated."
01:42:43.825,01:42:45.743,Listen.
01:42:45.743,01:42:49.080,I'll give it to you one more time.
01:42:49.080,01:42:53.208,MARCIA: Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years ago.
01:42:53.208,01:42:55.210,She changed her name when she married.
01:42:55.210,01:43:00.382,"Her husband died, she moved back to New York recently a very, very rich widow, but a recluse."
01:43:00.382,01:43:03.260,Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will.
01:43:03.260,01:43:06.305,"They have her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over."
01:43:06.305,01:43:08.099,"I guess, right there."
01:43:08.099,01:43:13.646,"She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they fake it, pretend Lillian House died."
01:43:13.646,01:43:26.117,"They cremate the sister, Lillian checks in to a fleabag joint, and for several weeks she pretends to be her sister: closing her accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money."
01:43:22.195,01:43:29.578,"What she didn't realize, was her husband was two-timing her with Helen Moss, this model."
01:43:29.578,01:43:37.753,"So he decides not to cut her in and go off to, I don't know, with his mistress, and keep all the dough."
01:43:37.753,01:43:45.053,"So he kills Lillian, he cremates her, pours molten steel all over her or something."
01:43:45.053,01:43:49.182,And that's when we came along and tripped him up.
01:43:49.182,01:43:51.184,He had some great alibis.
01:43:51.184,01:43:53.519,"Yeah, that woman who worked for him, Mrs. Dalton?"
01:43:53.519,01:43:55.312,She covered for him.
01:43:55.312,01:43:57.606,Not that she dreamed he was a murderer.
01:43:57.606,01:43:59.942,I want to celebrate.
01:43:59.942,01:44:03.821,Want to go see what Larry and Carol are up to?
01:44:03.821,01:44:06.448,I think they want to be alone.
01:44:06.448,01:44:10.078,"Oh, yeah."
01:44:10.078,01:44:12.621,"Well, you have any plans?"
01:44:12.621,01:44:14.373,"You're taking me to dinner, right?"
01:44:14.373,01:44:16.959,"Right, absolutely."
01:44:16.959,01:44:18.753,Why not?
01:44:18.753,01:44:23.049,"I already slept with Helen Moss once today, I'm not young and active like I used to be."
01:44:23.049,01:44:25.509,"You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you?"
01:44:28.804,01:44:30.181,What an experience.
01:44:30.181,01:44:32.683,I'm still vibrating.
01:44:30.181,01:44:35.228,"I know. Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave."
01:44:35.228,01:44:37.813,Really? Surprisingly?
01:44:37.813,01:44:40.691,"You know, I'm a pretty good guy."
01:44:40.691,01:44:42.068,"Yeah, I know."
01:44:42.068,01:44:43.945,So where do you want to go for dinner?
01:44:43.945,01:44:46.739,Let's not eat at any restaurant where they serve cowards.
01:44:46.739,01:44:48.490,What are you laughing at?
01:44:48.490,01:44:51.119,"You know, Larry, I love you."
01:44:51.119,01:44:53.746,How could you ever have been jealous of Marcia?
01:44:53.746,01:44:57.041,Isn't that ridiculous? Don't you know I can only love you?
01:44:57.041,01:44:59.668,You were jealous of Ted.
01:44:59.668,01:45:04.840,"Take away his elevator shoes, his fake suntan, his capped teeth, and what do you have?"
01:45:04.840,01:45:07.135,You.
01:45:07.135,01:45:09.678,That's a good one.
