00:02:40.034,00:02:41.035,Is that you?
00:02:41.244,00:02:43.538,"-Oh, no, no, that's my-- That's my mom. -Oh."
00:02:43.788,00:02:46.332,She came here when she found out she was pregnant.
00:02:46.541,00:02:48.167,"I've never been, but..."
00:02:48.626,00:02:50.003,...it's kind of our beach.
00:02:56.134,00:02:58.428,-That's my little sister. -Ah-hah.
00:03:04.225,00:03:05.768,"Um, you want to see more photos?"
00:03:12.275,00:03:14.110,It's only for your eyes.
00:03:14.277,00:03:15.528,Real. Authentic.
00:03:15.778,00:03:17.947,You're right. Thank you.
00:03:19.782,00:03:22.076,Sorry. I'm American. Heh.
00:03:22.744,00:03:26.664,"-Not too many gringos here. -Yeah, bummer."
00:03:38.593,00:03:39.594,She's not coming?
00:03:40.970,00:03:43.431,"My friend. You know, um, mi amiga."
00:03:43.640,00:03:45.099,The girl we left at the hotel.
00:03:45.308,00:03:48.686,"You know, she smelled like Don Julio and bad choices?"
00:03:48.895,00:03:51.606,She always does this to me too. She just disappears.
00:03:51.814,00:03:54.734,"She's like the fantasmo, no? You know fantasmo?"
00:03:57.403,00:04:01.241,The reason I planned to come on this trip was to find the secret beach...
00:04:01.407,00:04:04.619,...and now she's just stuck back at Las Rocas with the Irish flu.
00:04:21.928,00:04:23.471,"No, I don't. It's just, you know."
00:04:23.638,00:04:25.598,"It's not fair. You know why, though?"
00:04:25.765,00:04:27.267,It's because I'm reliable.
00:04:27.475,00:04:29.018,You know reliable?
00:04:29.519,00:04:30.520,Reliable.
00:04:33.022,00:04:36.526,Um.... I am re-li-able.
00:04:39.904,00:04:41.155,That's me.
00:04:58.715,00:05:01.050,You're not gonna tell me. Cool.
00:05:01.676,00:05:02.844,Cool.
00:05:07.640,00:05:09.851,"No, no, you're cool. You're being cool."
00:05:12.312,00:05:13.438,"All right, I got it."
00:05:28.119,00:05:29.537,Is this the one?
00:06:14.082,00:06:15.249,CARLOS: This is paradise.
00:06:17.335,00:06:19.003,It's perfect.
00:06:24.133,00:06:25.760,Um....
00:06:31.724,00:06:32.725,No.
00:06:38.606,00:06:40.233,"Ha, ha, no."
00:07:08.594,00:07:11.264,"We were going the same way. I live close, so don't worry."
00:07:11.848,00:07:12.890,Are you sure?
00:07:13.057,00:07:15.726,"-Yes. -Okay. Well, thank you."
00:07:15.893,00:07:17.562,You're welcome.
00:07:18.354,00:07:19.355,I'm Nancy.
00:07:19.689,00:07:21.441,Carlos. Charlie.
00:07:21.607,00:07:26.779,"-Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you --you know, high school."
00:07:26.988,00:07:29.240,-You're in school? -No.
00:07:29.407,00:07:30.658,I was in medical school...
00:07:30.825,00:07:32.910,"...but we didn't have Spanish, just cadavers."
00:07:33.077,00:07:35.246,I'll shut up now.
00:07:35.830,00:07:37.540,"Okay, dark in a few hours, so...."
00:07:37.999,00:07:39.500,"Oh, I never surf at night."
00:07:39.750,00:07:42.712,And how you getting out from here?
00:07:43.129,00:07:44.130,Uber.
00:07:44.547,00:07:45.756,Who is Uber?
00:07:46.549,00:07:47.967,"Never mind. Thank you, Carlos."
00:07:48.134,00:07:49.844,Thank you again for taking me here.
00:07:50.011,00:07:52.054,-It means a lot to me. -Okay.
00:07:52.221,00:07:54.265,What did you say the name of it was again?
00:07:54.432,00:07:56.100,"I just forgot, for some reason."
00:11:18.719,00:11:20.388,Hey!
00:11:26.394,00:11:28.354,"You speak Spanish, guera?"
00:11:34.985,00:11:37.279,I don't understand. I'm sorry.
00:11:37.446,00:11:39.323,It's hard to paddle against the current.
00:11:39.490,00:11:40.908,"Yeah, I wasn't expecting that."
00:11:41.075,00:11:43.327,I almost got caught on the inside coming out.
00:11:45.704,00:11:46.831,You American?
00:11:47.998,00:11:49.792,American. Yeah.
00:11:50.584,00:11:51.919,California?
00:11:52.545,00:11:54.380,"Uh, close. Texas."
00:11:55.214,00:11:57.007,There's surf in Texas?
00:11:57.174,00:12:00.428,"Yes, we have surf in Texas. It's just not like this, though."
00:12:06.600,00:12:09.937,"Hey, this is a secret break. How you find it?"
00:12:10.104,00:12:12.022,Someone told me about it a while ago.
00:12:12.189,00:12:13.399,What's it called?
00:12:13.566,00:12:16.819,"If I tell you, I would have to kill you."
00:12:16.986,00:12:18.612,"Well, that would ruin my day."
00:12:19.447,00:12:22.116,Anything gnarly out here I should know about?
00:12:22.283,00:12:23.826,There's some rocks over there!
00:12:23.993,00:12:25.953,There's only one tide a day.
00:12:26.120,00:12:28.330,"When the tide gets low, it becomes an island."
00:12:28.497,00:12:30.666,There's some nasty fire coral.
00:12:30.833,00:12:33.294,It stings like a jellyfish.
00:12:33.461,00:12:34.837,"Okay, gracias!"
00:12:37.923,00:12:39.341,"Hey, guera...."
00:12:43.637,00:12:46.140,Still have no idea what you're saying.
00:12:46.974,00:12:49.226,He's saying that you should come over here.
00:12:49.393,00:12:51.312,The wave breaks better.
00:12:51.479,00:12:54.440,"Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm cool here, thank you."
00:12:54.815,00:12:56.609,"Careful, gringa."
00:12:56.775,00:12:59.653,It's rough out here for a little girl from Texas.
00:13:00.029,00:13:02.114,I think I'll be all right.
00:13:51.580,00:13:53.123,Yeah!
00:14:03.676,00:14:05.219,Whoo!
00:14:18.232,00:14:19.775,Ah!
00:14:20.359,00:14:22.152,"Ha, ha, ha!"
00:14:36.417,00:14:38.127,NANCY: Yeah!
00:16:11.220,00:16:13.263,-Short crop? -Hey!
00:16:13.430,00:16:14.848,-Guess where I am? -Tijuana.
00:16:17.476,00:16:20.062,"Oh, my God. No way. Mom's beach, right?"
00:16:20.229,00:16:23.524,It's just as beautiful as she said it was.
00:16:24.274,00:16:27.319,I wish you were here. I wish she was here.
00:16:27.486,00:16:29.738,Does that mean you're alone?
00:16:29.905,00:16:32.366,I wasn't gonna come all this way just to wuss out...
00:16:32.574,00:16:33.993,...because I lost my plus one.
00:16:34.159,00:16:36.328,"That's how you wind up on Nancy Grace, okay?"
00:16:36.495,00:16:38.122,"Ha, ha, ha! Excuse me."
00:16:38.288,00:16:40.749,"I'm supposed to be the boring, overprotective sister."
00:16:40.916,00:16:42.042,You're the fun one.
00:16:42.626,00:16:44.837,"Sis, the surf here, it's insane."
00:16:45.004,00:16:47.464,You would not believe the perfect tube I just caught.
00:16:47.673,00:16:49.633,I could shoot tubes just as good as you...
00:16:49.800,00:16:51.677,...if you would just take me out!
00:16:51.844,00:16:54.263,I'll take you out as soon as I get back.
00:16:54.888,00:16:56.724,"I love you, sister-mama."
00:16:56.890,00:16:58.559,-I love you too. MAN: Is that Nancy?
00:16:58.726,00:17:00.144,-It's Dad. -Tell him it's fine.
00:17:00.310,00:17:01.478,"-Bye. -No, it's a friend."
00:17:01.645,00:17:02.938,"MAN: Nance, don't hang up."
00:17:03.105,00:17:05.315,Give me the phone. Chloe.
00:17:05.482,00:17:07.443,"-Hey! -Hey, Papa."
00:17:07.609,00:17:09.611,"Hey, sweet pea. Where now?"
00:17:09.778,00:17:11.405,Mexico.
00:17:12.197,00:17:14.867,"I don't know what to say, Nance. I'm at a loss. Heh, heh."
00:17:15.117,00:17:17.411,-I can't understand. -I don't expect you to.
00:17:17.578,00:17:18.829,"Well, help me out, then."
00:17:19.038,00:17:21.081,I don't know. What do you want me to say?
00:17:21.248,00:17:22.332,Say you're coming back.
00:17:22.499,00:17:26.128,Say you're not dropping out of med school after all this time and work.
00:17:26.295,00:17:28.380,"-You know, just don't quit. -Okay. Okay, Dad."
00:17:28.547,00:17:30.799,That's enough. Can we not do this right now?
00:17:30.966,00:17:33.302,It's what you love. You help people.
00:17:33.510,00:17:35.679,"Not everyone can be helped, Dad. You know that."
00:17:35.846,00:17:37.556,Don't do that.
00:17:38.390,00:17:41.894,-Don't make this about her. -What else would it be about?
00:17:43.228,00:17:46.356,"If you want to make this about her, then you stay in it."
00:17:46.523,00:17:48.275,She was a fighter.
00:17:52.237,00:17:54.782,"It's just she fought too hard, Dad."
00:17:55.157,00:17:57.868,You know? And for what?
00:17:59.119,00:18:01.538,It all ended the same.
00:18:02.206,00:18:05.751,"Just come back, Nancy. Please."
00:18:07.211,00:18:08.212,"I gotta go, okay?"
00:18:08.378,00:18:10.005,-I'll see you soon. -When?
00:18:10.172,00:18:11.757,-When? -I don't know.
00:18:11.924,00:18:13.258,Nance.
00:18:13.926,00:18:16.011,I love you. Bye.
00:19:31.587,00:19:34.673,"Yeah, girl, it's getting late. Let's go in."

00:30:44.926,00:30:47.929,I just put some Novocain injections...
00:30:48.096,00:30:50.807,"...to numb the area, so..."
00:30:51.015,00:30:53.184,"...you're gonna feel a little pressure, but..."
00:30:53.351,00:30:56.354,"...you're not gonna feel the stitches, okay?"
00:30:56.688,00:30:58.398,Okay?
00:31:10.785,00:31:12.871,"Tie off the suture. Oh, yeah."
00:31:13.538,00:31:15.373,That's a nice-- that's a nice union.
00:31:19.252,00:31:22.213,"One more, and then we'll send you on your way."

00:44:02.431,00:44:04.016,"No, there's a shark!"
00:44:05.142,00:44:06.644,Shark!

00:48:17.185,00:48:18.520,Come on! I got you!
00:48:18.854,00:48:20.522,I got you! Come on! Come on!
00:48:20.689,00:48:22.399,Come on!
00:49:02.773,00:49:03.815,Come on!
00:49:04.066,00:49:05.108,I got you!
00:49:06.610,00:49:08.278,I got you! Come on!
00:51:32.422,00:51:33.799,Come on.
00:51:38.094,00:51:39.179,Come on.
00:51:42.265,00:51:43.850,Come on.
00:51:49.648,00:51:50.649,You're okay.
00:51:50.816,00:51:52.234,"I'm helping you, little buddy."
00:51:54.110,00:51:55.362,Let me see you.
00:51:55.529,00:51:56.905,I'm not very good at ortho...
00:51:57.072,00:51:59.658,...but it just looks like a dislocation.
00:52:00.408,00:52:01.993,Like a separated shoulder.
00:52:03.328,00:52:05.413,I think it's the same.
00:52:05.580,00:52:07.123,"We'll see, huh?"
00:52:07.999,00:52:09.960,"I'm just gonna do this quick, okay?"
00:52:10.126,00:52:12.003,It's gonna hurt just for a second...
00:52:12.170,00:52:14.840,...and then you're gonna be okay.
00:52:15.423,00:52:17.217,On three. Ready?
00:52:19.469,00:52:20.929,One....
00:52:21.263,00:52:23.390,Two.... Three.
00:52:25.141,00:52:26.434,I think we did it.
00:52:26.643,00:52:29.062,"Ah, ah. Hey, hey, hey!"
00:52:29.229,00:52:31.398,That's a terrible way to say thank you.
00:52:33.191,00:52:35.110,"Now you've got a chance, huh?"
00:52:40.866,00:52:43.285,And here comes the tide.
00:52:48.373,00:52:49.416,Camera.
00:53:07.934,00:53:10.061,That's the third time.
00:53:10.228,00:53:12.856,I got you.
00:53:13.023,00:53:16.443,32 seconds from the whale to the rock.
00:56:18.291,00:56:19.292,I got you!
00:56:19.459,00:56:20.460,I got you! I got you!
00:56:20.627,00:56:22.295,Come on!
00:56:22.837,00:56:24.297,Hold on!
00:56:43.691,00:56:45.693,Someone got you.
00:56:54.202,00:56:56.955,"Thirty, 40 yards."
00:56:58.164,00:57:00.375,One minute swim.
00:57:05.547,00:57:07.549,I can make that.
00:57:10.635,00:57:12.804,I need a head start.
00:57:45.879,00:57:47.172,This is Nancy Adams.
00:57:47.338,00:57:49.674,"It's April 26, 2016."
00:57:49.841,00:57:51.968,"If you find this, please send help right away."
00:57:52.135,00:57:53.553,I've been attacked by a shark.
00:57:53.720,00:57:55.638,He's killed three other people since I got here.
00:57:55.805,00:57:57.932,"He's still circling, so...."
00:57:58.516,00:58:00.935,He's got this big old whale over here...
00:58:01.102,00:58:04.439,"...but that's the problem, I swam right up on his feeding ground."
00:58:04.606,00:58:06.232,I've been bitten pretty deeply...
00:58:06.399,00:58:09.235,...into my-my gastroc and quad muscles.
00:58:09.402,00:58:11.863,I have a-- A deep gash running vertically...
00:58:12.030,00:58:13.281,...down my medial thigh...
00:58:13.448,00:58:15.825,"...and then it turns lateral, just above my knee."
00:58:15.992,00:58:19.162,"And right here, there's one going across my posterior calf."
00:58:19.621,00:58:22.832,I'm losing a lot of blood. Gangrene is setting in.
00:58:22.999,00:58:25.627,I feel like I'm losing my strength.
00:58:25.793,00:58:27.295,I don't think I have much time.
00:58:27.462,00:58:32.258,The island I'm on is gonna be taken by the tide in a few minutes.
00:58:32.425,00:58:34.385,I'm about 200 yards off the shore.
00:58:34.552,00:58:35.929,On this beach.
00:58:36.346,00:58:39.265,I never found out what it was called.
00:58:41.601,00:58:43.228,So....
00:58:48.900,00:58:50.401,Um....
00:58:52.570,00:58:53.780,This is useless.
00:58:55.114,00:58:56.366,There's a buoy...
00:58:56.574,00:58:59.327,...which I'm gonna try to swim to...
00:58:59.494,00:59:02.205,...about 30 or 40 yards away.
00:59:04.582,00:59:06.209,"So, yeah. Heh."
00:59:07.252,00:59:09.295,That's the plan.
00:59:15.885,00:59:21.933,If you find this can you just-- Can you just delete that first part...
00:59:22.100,00:59:27.564,...and send it to 10231 Oliver Crescent Drive...
00:59:27.730,00:59:30.191,"...Galveston, Texas. That's my home."
00:59:30.358,00:59:33.611,That's where my dad and sister live.
00:59:49.252,00:59:50.253,"Hey, Pop."
00:59:50.420,00:59:52.255,"Hey, Chlo."
00:59:53.172,00:59:54.841,Um....
00:59:55.550,00:59:58.219,I finally got that alone time.
00:59:59.095,01:00:01.180,Super overrated. Heh.
01:00:01.973,01:00:03.433,Um....
01:00:03.725,01:00:05.852,"I mean, I'm not totally alone."
01:00:06.019,01:00:07.186,I got this little dude.
01:00:07.353,01:00:09.564,"Steven Seagull here, keeping me company."
01:00:09.731,01:00:11.649,Show them your wing.
01:00:12.025,01:00:14.152,"I fixed him for you, Chlo."
01:00:17.030,01:00:21.451,"I just don't want you guys to worry, and I don't want you to feel..."
01:00:22.368,01:00:24.120,"...you know, bad or anything..."
01:00:24.287,01:00:27.165,...because I love you so much.
01:00:27.457,01:00:32.712,And I miss you more than I ever-- I ever even realized I could.
01:00:33.463,01:00:36.841,"Dad, I gotta get off this rock soon."
01:00:38.134,01:00:40.803,But I want you to know I'm gonna fight.
01:00:42.055,01:00:43.640,I am.
01:00:43.806,01:00:46.017,Just like she taught us.
01:00:46.351,01:00:48.061,You were right. Heh.
01:01:01.282,01:01:03.242,I love you.
01:01:04.369,01:01:06.954,I love you so much.
01:01:17.757,01:01:19.592,Time to go.
01:01:52.959,01:01:55.128,It's okay. It's okay. You got it. Good job.
01:02:00.717,01:02:03.177,"You're gonna make it, buddy."
01:02:11.519,01:02:12.937,You're okay.
01:02:23.489,01:02:24.657,Okay.
01:02:24.824,01:02:26.451,Okay.
01:03:07.408,01:03:09.368,Shit.
01:03:09.535,01:03:11.162,"Oh, you're kidding me."
01:03:20.254,01:03:23.341,"You didn't like that, because it stings like jellyfish."
01:03:39.690,01:03:40.900,This is my head start.
01:07:09.984,01:07:12.903,Come on. Come on!
01:07:18.159,01:07:19.869,Okay....
01:07:40.181,01:07:41.223,Okay.
01:08:53.796,01:08:56.757,"No, no, no, come back. Come back."
01:08:58.843,01:08:59.927,Come back.
01:09:00.636,01:09:01.720,Come back.
01:09:05.599,01:09:07.226,Come on.
01:09:21.240,01:09:22.908,Come back.
01:10:30.392,01:10:31.685,This is Nancy Adams.
01:10:31.852,01:10:34.355,"It's April, 26th, 2016."
01:10:34.521,01:10:36.649,"If you find this, please send help right away."
01:10:36.815,01:10:38.484,I've been attacked by a shark.
01:10:38.651,01:10:41.195,He's killed three other people since I got here.
01:10:41.362,01:10:42.696,I'm losing a lot of blood.
01:10:42.863,01:10:44.990,I feel like I'm losing my strength.
01:10:52.081,01:10:53.791,"CHLOE: No way. Mom's beach, right?"
01:10:53.958,01:10:55.542,NANCY: Not everyone can be helped.
01:10:55.709,01:10:58.295,"I don't want you to feel, you know, bad or anything."
01:10:58.462,01:11:00.798,"-I gotta go, Dad. See you later. FATHER: Hey, sweet pea."
01:11:00.965,01:11:02.925,NANCY: Never found out.... FATHER: She was a fighter....
01:11:03.092,01:11:05.511,"NANCY: I'm gonna fight, just like she taught us."
01:11:18.107,01:11:19.275,Uh-uh.
01:12:05.738,01:12:07.239,Where are you?
01:12:16.874,01:12:18.167,Fuck you.
01:12:34.808,01:12:35.809,"Oh, shit."
01:12:37.811,01:12:39.271,No. No!
01:12:40.564,01:12:42.566,No. No!
01:12:49.198,01:12:50.199,No.
01:13:52.010,01:13:53.095,No.
01:15:54.216,01:15:55.676,CARLOS: Miguel.
01:17:29.311,01:17:31.229,Relax. Relax.
01:17:31.396,01:17:33.857,Breathe. Breathe.
01:18:50.600,01:18:52.310,I'm okay.
01:19:44.738,01:19:46.865,"Ready to get wet, Dr. Adams?"
01:19:47.032,01:19:49.951,"-Well, we'll see about that. -Nancy...."
01:19:51.870,01:19:54.623,Ma would be proud of you. Both of you.
01:19:57.501,01:20:00.045,"Thanks, Papa. Time to go."
01:20:02.839,01:20:04.800,Do you think I'll ever be as good as you?
01:20:04.966,01:20:06.343,No.
