00:34:35.156,00:34:39.912,It seems as if I could do something for you.
00:34:39.912,00:34:42.706,I see.
00:34:42.706,00:34:46.710,You think because I don't have some flashy office I don't know what I'm talking about?
00:34:46.710,00:34:50.129,I worked with Elton John.
00:34:50.129,00:34:55.093,Let me see.

00:35:27.584,00:35:34.257,"I will block out all the noise of this crazy fuckin' business, and we can build something big."
00:35:34.257,00:35:39.888,"But you gotta believe in me the way that I believe in you, the way that I believe in this."
00:35:39.888,00:35:44.183,"Because you have a unique talent, Eric."
00:35:44.183,00:35:45.852,Don't fuck around.
00:35:47.186,00:35:49.522,But you know what?
00:35:51.190,00:35:55.654,"If you can't handle it, if it's too much fuckin' pressure for you, then fine."

00:44:53.774,00:44:55.734,"Yeah. That's what I'm talking about, man."
00:44:55.734,00:44:57.362,"But you hear the difference, right?"
00:44:57.362,00:45:00.532,"Yeah, way better than the shit I came up with."
00:45:00.532,00:45:03.159,"Excuse me, gentlemen."
00:45:03.159,00:45:05.203,I thought you'd like to know...

00:45:18.924,00:45:21.427,"Very strong lyrics too, Cube."
00:45:21.427,00:45:23.762,Very strong.
00:45:23.762,00:45:25.764,So what's up with our contracts though?

00:45:47.786,00:45:51.790,What am I supposed to do?
00:45:51.790,00:45:55.169,"We have a baby, Andre."
00:45:55.169,00:45:57.796,And you in the streets fuckin' around?
00:45:57.796,00:46:03.094,"What? I'm out here bustin' my fuckin' ass day and fuckin' night, tryin' to create something."
00:46:03.094,00:46:05.804,"You gonna come up in here, talkin' about some fuckin' bitches? Are you crazy?"
00:46:05.804,00:46:08.307,You don't get it.
00:46:08.307,00:46:10.809,Daddy!
00:46:10.809,00:46:12.520,"Chill out, man."
00:46:15.940,00:46:19.235,"Tyra, it's gonna be okay."
00:46:19.235,00:46:20.819,"Bye, Dre."

00:46:58.691,00:47:01.569,What's this?
00:47:01.569,00:47:04.781,-What the fuck?
00:47:04.781,00:47:06.616,Get on the ground!
00:47:06.616,00:47:09.994,On the ground?
00:47:09.994,00:47:12.871,-What we do?
00:47:12.871,00:47:15.874,Get on the ground. Now.
00:47:15.874,00:47:17.502,Let's go.
00:47:17.502,00:47:19.878,Hands behind your back.
00:47:19.878,00:47:22.839,This is fucked up.
00:47:22.839,00:47:25.718,"The fuck you got us on the ground like this for, Officer?"
00:47:25.718,00:47:28.887,There's seven of you and four of us. So sit tight and let us do our job.
00:47:28.887,00:47:32.141,"Officer, I'm sorry."
00:47:32.141,00:47:34.811,"We're trying to check these bangers, make sure they're clean."
00:47:34.811,00:47:37.104,I'm sorry.
00:47:37.104,00:47:38.897,These are artists.
00:47:38.897,00:47:40.608,Excuse me?
00:47:40.608,00:47:42.151,Seriously?
00:47:42.151,00:47:43.860,What kind of artists?
00:47:43.860,00:47:46.322,And they're working with me in the studio right now.
00:47:46.322,00:47:48.282,"Well, see, rap is not an art."
00:47:48.282,00:47:49.908,I'm sorry.
00:47:49.908,00:47:52.911,"-Well, you're wasting your time, Mr. Manager."
00:47:52.911,00:47:54.747,You're wasting your time.
00:47:54.747,00:47:58.292,"These clients of yours, these rappers, they look like gang members."
00:47:58.292,00:48:02.213,You can't come down here and arrest people just because of what they look like.
00:48:02.213,00:48:04.674,"What, are you crazy?"
00:48:04.674,00:48:06.509,"You said you're a manager, right?"
00:48:06.509,00:48:09.303,Not a fuckin' lawyer.
00:48:09.303,00:48:12.390,You cannot come down here and harass these guys...
00:48:12.390,00:48:14.058,because they're black!
00:48:14.058,00:48:16.143,People have rights!
00:48:16.143,00:48:20.189,"I'll step back, you let them up."
00:48:20.189,00:48:23.025,You don't tell them to get up.
00:48:23.025,00:48:26.654,You have no idea the people I know. I'm gonna call the mayor's office.
00:48:26.654,00:48:28.197,Step back.
00:48:42.628,00:48:44.255,Now get up.
00:48:45.964,00:48:48.718,Get up now!
00:48:50.428,00:48:53.806,"Okay. Come on, guys."
00:48:53.806,00:48:56.267,And the fuck out of Torrance.
00:48:56.267,00:48:58.269,You got a problem?
00:48:58.269,00:49:01.146,"You ain't tough now, huh?"
00:49:01.146,00:49:03.232,"Eric, come on."
00:49:03.232,00:49:05.276,You got a problem?
00:49:07.445,00:49:09.781,-I didn't hear you.
00:49:09.781,00:49:11.490,You's a fuckin' sellout.
00:49:11.490,00:49:13.659,Shut up.
00:49:13.659,00:49:15.411,Everything's fine.
00:49:15.411,00:49:17.496,Yeah.
00:49:17.496,00:49:20.833,"You got something to say, boy?"
00:49:20.833,00:49:22.501,Cube. Get inside.
00:49:22.501,00:49:24.503,-Let's get back to work.
00:49:24.503,00:49:25.962,"Get inside, boy."
00:49:25.962,00:49:28.257,You shut the fuck up!
00:49:28.257,00:49:30.967,Get the fuck back inside.
00:49:31.636,00:49:33.429,"Get inside, Cube."
00:49:35.264,00:49:38.016,We're gonna go back and work. Okay?
00:49:38.016,00:49:40.895,-You know? Leave us alone.
00:49:40.895,00:49:43.230,You're fuckin' disgraceful.
00:49:46.358,00:49:48.569,I got something for this beat.
00:49:50.237,00:49:51.988,"Hey, Yella, cut it."
00:49:53.073,00:49:56.118,"What is it lookin' like, Dre?"
00:50:01.582,00:50:03.041,"Hell yeah, Cube."
00:50:03.041,00:50:06.044,"This gon' start some shit, but this what we need."
00:50:06.044,00:50:44.750,Comin' straight about a bitch?
00:50:49.005,00:51:05.688,"by a stupid dope brother Hey, Dre!"
00:51:07.189,00:51:09.817,They lovin' that shit.
00:51:09.817,00:51:12.820,This is Greg Mack of the Mack Attack.
00:51:12.820,00:51:15.823,"I gotta tell you, you are witnessing history."
00:51:15.823,00:51:24.540,"LA's first super group, N.W.A., with their new album Straight Outta Compton, and they're taking the nation by storm."
00:51:27.125,00:51:30.713,Can y'all hear that?
00:51:30.713,00:51:33.049,"Well, clap your hands then!"
00:51:33.049,00:51:35.593,Eazy!
00:51:35.593,00:51:38.136,Eazy!
00:51:38.136,00:51:40.639,-Eazy!
00:51:40.639,00:51:43.141,-Eazy!
00:52:03.203,00:52:06.122,-Eazy!
00:52:06.122,00:52:08.375,-Eazy!
00:52:08.375,00:52:11.169,-Eazy!
00:52:11.169,00:52:14.298,Gangster rap has become incredibly popular and profitable...
00:52:14.298,00:52:18.052,by selling lyrics about violence to a young mainstream audience...
00:52:18.052,00:52:20.638,that wouldn't dream of going anywhere near a ghetto.
00:52:20.638,00:52:24.058,"Not all music stars, as you know, are model citizens."
00:52:24.058,00:52:26.769,Some have had run-ins with the law.
00:52:26.769,00:52:30.355,But now a few musicians have taken that to new heights.
00:52:30.355,00:52:32.066,Or to new depths.
00:52:36.194,00:52:38.196,That shit was dope!
00:52:38.196,00:52:40.116,"No, man, no."
00:52:40.116,00:52:42.785,You gotta let me come fuck with y'all in Miami.

00:52:46.455,00:52:49.207,"Come on, bro."
00:52:49.207,00:52:52.210,"No, what you think Ma gonna think about you comin' on tour, huh?"
00:52:52.210,00:52:56.841,"'Cause you know you got school, and you know she ain't gonna let you miss that many days, man!"
00:52:56.841,00:52:59.135,You did.
00:52:59.135,00:53:01.219,"Hey, look, I'll tell you what."
00:53:01.219,00:53:06.558,"You stay your little ass outta trouble, I'll call you when I'm on the way to Miami, see about getting you on a flight."
00:53:06.558,00:53:09.311,I can come out there?
00:53:09.311,00:53:12.773,"Hey, bring the rubbers, T."
00:53:12.773,00:53:16.527,I still got the same ones you gave me a long time ago.
00:53:16.527,00:53:19.155,"Hey, hey. Hold on, T."
00:53:19.155,00:53:20.656,Here.
00:53:20.656,00:53:23.241,Hello? Dre?
00:53:25.119,00:53:26.829,Hold on!
00:53:28.497,00:53:30.499,"Yeah, nigga, I'm lookin' for my girl Felicia."
00:53:30.499,00:53:33.002,I heard she was up in one of these rooms.
00:53:33.002,00:53:35.171,"Ain't no Felicia in here, nigga."
00:53:35.171,00:53:36.755,Mind if I take a look?
00:53:36.755,00:53:39.257,"Get the fuck outta my room, man!"
00:53:40.676,00:53:43.219,"This nigga just came to my motherfuckin' door strapped, man."
00:53:43.219,00:53:45.639,Where you going?
00:53:45.639,00:53:48.100,"Hey, where Felicia at?"
00:53:48.100,00:53:49.977,Where Felicia?
00:53:49.977,00:53:53.605,"Hey, Felicia."
00:53:53.605,00:53:57.026,All right. So none of y'all are named Felicia now. Okay.
00:53:57.026,00:53:58.861,Yella!
00:53:58.861,00:54:00.738,"Hey, Yella!"
00:54:00.738,00:54:03.365,Your name Felicia?
00:54:03.365,00:54:05.701,"No, wait! Valerie."
00:54:05.701,00:54:07.703,Whatever.
00:54:07.703,00:54:09.705,Felicia!
00:54:09.705,00:54:12.624,She's suckin' dick though.
00:54:12.624,00:54:14.292,What?
00:54:14.292,00:54:16.712,I'll show this nigga right now.
00:54:16.712,00:54:19.215,"Hey, Ren."
00:54:19.215,00:54:21.008,Hey!
00:54:19.215,00:54:23.594,What's that-- Talkin' 'bout strapped.
00:54:25.179,00:54:27.431,"Let's ride, nigga."
00:54:33.812,00:54:36.232,Hey.
00:54:36.232,00:54:37.733,She in there or what?
00:54:38.901,00:54:41.904,She kinda preoccupied with some real nigga dick.
00:54:41.904,00:54:44.322,"The fuck you say, little nigga?"
00:54:44.322,00:54:46.742,"I said she got a motherfuckin' dick in her mouth, nigga!"
00:54:46.742,00:54:49.703,"Oh, it ain't fun no more?"
00:54:49.703,00:54:52.957,"Nigga, she's trying to compensate."
00:54:52.957,00:54:56.085,Wow!
00:54:58.087,00:55:00.338,"Punk-ass niggas, man."
00:55:00.338,00:55:02.049,Y'all wild.
00:55:02.049,00:55:05.385,Nigga runnin' so fast.
00:55:05.385,00:55:07.387,Tryin' to get me killed?
00:55:07.387,00:55:11.183,Crazy.
00:55:11.183,00:55:12.810,"Bye, Felicia."
00:55:46.677,00:55:48.971,Fifteen on that!
00:55:48.971,00:55:52.099,"Fuck, man!"
00:55:54.350,00:55:56.895,Excuse me!
00:55:56.895,00:56:00.565,"I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news, but-- What you got?"
00:56:00.565,00:56:03.359,"Oh, shit."
00:56:04.402,00:56:06.362,Motherfuckin' FBI.
00:56:08.115,00:56:10.742,What the fuck?
00:56:10.742,00:56:13.495,"Wait, the FBI?"
00:56:13.495,00:56:15.664,"I mean, what the letter say, Jerry?"
00:56:15.664,00:56:20.294,"Uh, basically, uh-- A song recorded by the rap group N.W.A...."
00:56:20.294,00:56:22.504,on their album ‘Straight Out Of Compton'...
00:56:22.504,00:56:25.049,encourages violence against law enforcement.
00:56:25.049,00:56:27.343,Advocating violence and assault is wrong...
00:56:27.343,00:56:31.222,and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.
00:56:31.222,00:56:32.681,Fuck that.
00:56:32.681,00:56:34.390,Fuck the law enforcement community.
00:56:34.390,00:56:37.353,We got freedom of speech.
00:56:37.353,00:56:40.731,"You wanna provoke 'em and find out? Because this is a warning, Cube."
00:56:40.731,00:56:44.484,"And it's about Fuck Tha Police in particular, so..."
00:56:44.484,00:56:48.322,"I think, uh, maybe we should not play that song right now."
00:56:48.322,00:56:51.116,Not play what?
00:56:51.116,00:56:53.577,"Relax, relax. We're not giving in to anything."
00:56:53.577,00:56:56.454,I just say we retire it for now.
00:56:56.454,00:56:59.083,It is a reasonably worded threat.
00:56:59.083,00:57:00.751,"This isn't, uh, street bullshit."
00:57:00.751,00:57:03.837,This isn't the Crips and Bloods and crap.
00:57:03.837,00:57:06.464,These guys can come after us a million different ways.
00:57:06.464,00:57:08.466,I don't even want to think about it.
00:57:08.466,00:57:11.762,-The fuck does that mean?
00:57:11.762,00:57:14.430,"But we can't let them censor us, Jerry."
00:57:14.430,00:57:16.433,"I'm not advocating for censorship, Cube."
00:57:16.433,00:57:20.478,Maybe none of us should be worried.
00:57:20.478,00:57:22.106,"What you mean, E?"
00:57:22.106,00:57:24.233,'Cause this right here is a gift.
00:57:24.233,00:57:27.611,"It's the FBI, E."

00:57:40.040,00:57:41.666,"My nigga, I feel you."
00:57:41.666,00:57:44.795,"If that's what you wanna do, then we can-- That's what I wanna do."
00:57:44.795,00:57:48.299,"That's what we wanna do, Jerry."
00:57:49.133,00:57:51.135,That's what we wanna do.

00:58:06.775,00:58:08.526,"Good night, Jerry."
00:58:08.526,00:58:11.822,Compton's crap!
00:58:11.822,00:58:14.199,Ain't that some shit.

00:58:17.453,00:58:19.037,This is not music!
00:58:19.037,00:58:22.582,"Shit, the truth is, they can do whatever they want with 'em."
00:58:23.708,00:58:25.543,They bought them motherfuckers.
00:58:53.613,00:58:57.575,You can't fuck every broad on the planet.
00:58:57.575,00:59:02.206,-So now pussy a problem?
00:59:02.206,00:59:03.874,Right?
00:59:03.874,00:59:07.585,"You make some money, you got all these problems, you have to take care of 'em."
00:59:07.585,00:59:10.588,It's fine.
00:59:10.588,00:59:13.717,"Hey, Cube."
00:59:13.717,00:59:17.095,"But what's up, E?"
00:59:17.095,00:59:19.723,Didn't I tell you to-- You know what?
00:59:19.723,00:59:22.476,-I'm not talking to Jerry.
00:59:22.476,00:59:24.228,That is actually-- It's my department.
00:59:24.228,00:59:26.563,"You're absolutely right to ask, Cube."
00:59:26.563,00:59:28.524,The contracts are being finalized as we speak.
00:59:28.524,00:59:31.609,"The thing is, with these attorneys, they'll take forever."
00:59:31.609,00:59:34.863,"Poring over it, they'll bleed us dry."
00:59:34.863,00:59:37.949,I wish I got paid by the hour the way they do. You know?
00:59:37.949,00:59:39.784,Me too.
00:59:39.784,00:59:44.248,"I just want to know what's goin' on, since I did write a lot of lyrics on this record."
00:59:45.582,00:59:48.626,"Everybody knows how important you are, Cube."
00:59:48.626,00:59:50.879,They do?
00:59:50.879,00:59:53.090,That's what's goin' on.
00:59:53.090,00:59:55.133,"We just need some time, that's all."
00:59:58.636,01:00:00.597,Everything probably all right.
01:00:01.681,01:00:03.434,I must be trippin'.
01:00:09.356,01:00:11.400,Shit tastes pretty good.
01:00:12.359,01:00:13.860,"Someday, right?"
01:00:15.904,01:00:18.323,Y'all enjoy your meal.
01:00:24.621,01:00:27.874,"I'm telling you, that guy wants to be you very frickin' badly."
01:00:27.874,01:00:31.253,As if I ain't got enough fucking problems. Right?
01:00:31.253,01:00:33.671,Excuse me.
01:00:33.671,01:00:36.674,"Nah, I just think you overreacting, man."
01:00:36.674,01:00:39.719,"Eazy one of us, Cube."
01:00:39.719,01:00:42.680,What don't make sense is Eazy and Jerry eating steak and lobster...
01:00:42.680,01:00:44.849,and we eating Fatburger.
01:00:44.849,01:00:46.684,Shit don't make no sense.
01:00:46.684,01:00:50.897,"Look, I hear you, but I think we need to ride this wave."
01:00:50.897,01:00:52.690,For real.
01:00:52.690,01:00:55.235,Don't be jumping to conclusions until you know for sure.
01:00:55.235,01:00:57.654,You know?
01:01:02.700,01:01:04.744,"It's my moms, man."
01:01:23.305,01:01:24.973,"Yo, Dre."
01:01:24.973,01:01:26.850,What's going on?
01:01:26.850,01:01:32.689,"Um-- Moms just called, man."
01:01:36.360,01:01:37.861,It's Tyree.
01:01:38.862,01:01:40.738,He's dead.
01:01:40.738,01:01:43.741,-What?
01:01:43.741,01:01:47.162,He got into a fight.
01:01:49.998,01:01:52.209,"It's my little brother, man."
01:01:56.254,01:01:58.465,It's my little baby bro.
01:02:06.598,01:02:08.684,"Fuckin' Compton, man."
01:02:08.684,01:02:13.771,"Come on, man, like-- It's my fault, man."
01:02:13.771,01:02:16.358,This never would've happened-- Don't talk like that.
01:02:16.358,01:02:18.360,"if I had him out here, man."
01:02:18.360,01:02:20.696,It's my fuckin' fault.
01:02:20.696,01:02:22.364,It coulda happened in another way.
01:02:23.615,01:02:25.701,"You can't blame yourself for that, Dre."
01:02:25.701,01:02:29.079,Tyree gonna always be with you.
01:02:29.079,01:02:30.788,Yeah.

01:02:50.808,01:02:53.604,"This is not on you, Andre."
01:02:53.604,01:02:58.149,"If I had just brought him on tour with me, like he wanted."
01:02:58.149,01:03:00.193,Stop this nonsense now.
01:03:01.278,01:03:05.490,"Your brother looked up to you, and you took great care of him."
01:03:05.490,01:03:07.825,We both did.
01:03:07.825,01:03:11.162,It's time to let someone else take care of him now.

01:10:02.115,01:10:05.201,Fuck the police!
01:10:08.245,01:10:11.415,How do you explain inciting a riot in Detroit? What do you have to say about that?
01:10:11.415,01:10:14.669,"I have to say that, uh, we didn't incite that shit."
01:10:14.669,01:10:18.214,Right. Y'all just got a snapshot of how Americans really feel.
01:10:18.214,01:10:20.550,We gave the people a voice.
01:10:20.550,01:10:23.219,We gave the people truth.
01:10:23.219,01:10:27.974,"Yeah, but your songs, they glamorize the lifestyle of gangs, guns, drugs."
01:10:27.974,01:10:30.852,Our art is a reflection of our reality.
01:10:30.852,01:10:32.854,What you see when you go outside your door?
01:10:32.854,01:10:35.231,I know what I see.
01:10:35.231,01:10:38.776,We get AKs from Russia and cocaine from Colombia.
01:10:38.776,01:10:44.532,"And ain't none of us got a passport, so-- Might wanna check the source."
01:10:44.532,01:10:48.119,-Next question.
01:10:48.119,01:10:49.662,No.
01:10:49.662,01:10:53.290,"Freedom of speech includes rap music, right?"
01:10:53.290,01:10:57.128,"Well, we exercising our first amendment as far as I'm concerned."
01:10:57.128,01:10:59.296,And the government wrote that.
01:10:59.296,01:11:03.968,"So, Cube, what's a guy from Compton do when he starts making real money like this?"
01:11:09.766,01:11:11.475,Cube?
01:11:12.309,01:11:14.604,Buy Raider gear.
01:11:14.604,01:11:16.189,And curl activator.
01:11:17.523,01:11:19.817,Next question.
01:11:34.624,01:11:36.333,"Good to see you, Cube."
01:11:36.333,01:11:38.544,"I can barely see you, Jerry."
01:11:38.544,01:11:41.297,What's with all the Godfather shit?
01:11:42.757,01:11:44.592,Okay.
01:11:44.592,01:11:47.053,I know that you've been very eager...
01:11:47.053,01:11:50.389,"to sign a contract with Eric's company, Ruthless Records."
01:11:50.389,01:11:52.683,Eric's company?
01:11:52.683,01:11:56.353,That's incorrect.
01:11:56.353,01:11:58.314,You work for me?
01:11:58.314,01:12:00.357,I've made that clear from the beginning.
01:12:00.357,01:12:03.444,"All right, cool."
01:12:03.444,01:12:05.655,"Cube, those guys are paid to make trouble."
01:12:05.655,01:12:08.616,They're gonna create problems where no problems exist.
01:12:08.616,01:12:12.078,"Jerry, you know I don't know what none of this legal shit mean. All right?"
01:12:12.078,01:12:15.372,None of us do.
01:12:15.372,01:12:17.541,Everybody else has already signed.
01:12:19.127,01:12:20.878,I thought you knew this.
01:12:20.878,01:12:23.339,You're the only one who hasn't.
01:12:28.385,01:12:30.346,There's also this.
01:12:31.764,01:12:33.641,"$75,000."
01:12:36.853,01:12:38.395,Shit.
01:12:38.395,01:12:40.064,Sign the contract...
01:12:40.064,01:12:42.317,and all this money is yours.
01:12:42.317,01:12:45.278,"That's my money anyway, Jerry."
01:12:45.278,01:12:47.404,"Now, I wrote a lot of hit songs."
01:12:47.404,01:12:51.408,"We've been performing on this tour for months, sellin' out shows, sellin' records."
01:12:51.408,01:12:54.411,I know it's plenty of money.
01:12:54.411,01:12:56.413,Jesus Christ.
01:12:56.413,01:12:59.416,"Give me my money, Jerry."
01:12:59.416,01:13:03.379,How the hell do you think all of this gets paid for?
01:13:03.379,01:13:09.426,"The hotel rooms, the tour buses, security, the parties, all this shit."
01:13:09.426,01:13:12.429,How do you think it gets paid for? You think it's free?
01:13:12.429,01:13:16.433,"If we were so good, why didn't you give us contracts in the beginning?"
01:13:16.433,01:13:19.562,"Because nothing is a sure thing, Cube."
01:13:19.562,01:13:23.399,Even a great talent can crash and burn.
01:13:25.651,01:13:30.447,"Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations."
01:13:32.200,01:13:33.951,It tends to ruin things.
01:13:33.951,01:13:36.204,You ought to keep that in mind.
01:13:43.836,01:13:46.256,"This Eric's company, right?"
01:13:50.260,01:13:51.969,"Bye, Jerry."
01:13:51.969,01:13:53.429,I'm out.

01:30:47.483,01:30:50.362,"You're with, uh, Suge Knight?"
01:30:52.948,01:30:55.825,Someone else?
01:30:57.119,01:30:59.162,Have yourself a good night.
01:31:01.415,01:31:03.375,Jerry.
01:31:13.009,01:31:15.845,Shit.
01:31:30.944,01:31:32.946,"So, what's up?"
01:31:34.530,01:31:38.243,"When you talked to me on the phone, man, you sounded pretty worked up."
01:31:42.538,01:31:44.498,"Yeah, I know you don't like hearing this shit."
01:31:46.001,01:31:49.463,"It's about Jerry, man."
01:31:51.173,01:31:53.925,That's really why you came here?
01:31:53.925,01:31:56.470,"I thought all this shit was in the past, Dre."
01:31:59.555,01:32:02.600,"This some real shit, man."
01:32:02.600,01:32:04.644,I had some people look into this.
01:32:04.644,01:32:06.355,I ain't been gettin' my fair share.
01:32:06.355,01:32:08.023,Do you even know why you rich though?
01:32:08.023,01:32:10.108,Do you know why you got a big-ass house...
01:32:10.108,01:32:12.194,and you ain't sleepin' on your auntie couch no more?
01:32:12.194,01:32:14.654,Because Jerry made that possible for us.
01:32:14.654,01:32:17.824,He kicked down the door for that shit to happen.
01:32:17.824,01:32:20.494,And you just gonna turn your back on him?
01:32:20.494,01:32:23.163,"Cube was right, fool."
01:32:23.163,01:32:27.209,"Eazy, look at the papers, man, and you'll see what the fuck I'm talkin' about."
01:32:27.209,01:32:31.380,"And forget about Jerry, man!"
01:32:31.380,01:32:32.839,We didn't make it because of Jerry.
01:32:32.839,01:32:34.924,We made it because our shit is dope.
01:32:36.801,01:32:38.594,"And we can keep going, E."
01:32:38.594,01:32:42.974,"We can own the goddamn world, but we just can't be fucking with him no more."
01:32:45.143,01:32:47.854,"Man, we started this N.W.A. shit."
01:32:50.315,01:32:51.941,I just want it to be right.
01:32:51.941,01:32:54.610,And this what you think right?
01:32:55.778,01:32:58.614,Turnin' your back on somebody after all he done for us.
01:32:58.614,01:33:01.535,You mean all he done for you.
01:33:02.576,01:33:03.995,Right?
01:33:05.539,01:33:06.956,Look at me.
01:33:09.418,01:33:10.919,Look at me.
01:33:15.006,01:33:17.050,When Tyree died...
01:33:19.135,01:33:22.305,you said we was always gonna be brothers.
01:33:23.306,01:33:25.350,But I guess you forgot about that.
01:33:28.061,01:33:31.605,"I'm-a start my own company with Suge Knight, E."
01:33:45.036,01:33:47.080,"Thought we were brothers, man."
01:33:50.666,01:33:53.128,I think he's Five-O.
01:34:10.520,01:34:15.358,"'cause you niggas know What up, Dre?"
01:34:15.358,01:34:18.694,We about to do this shit.
01:34:18.694,01:34:27.287,So get it right This shit sound good.
01:34:27.287,01:34:31.916,Yeah. None of it means anything while I'm under contract with Ruthless.
01:34:31.916,01:34:33.960,I told you about that.
01:34:33.960,01:34:36.754,"I'm gonna get you out of your contracts, I promise you."
01:34:38.131,01:34:39.673,"Yeah, all right."
01:34:45.679,01:34:47.432,"What up with you, cuz?"
01:34:47.432,01:34:49.017,What up?
01:34:49.017,01:34:51.727,"What up, lo?"
01:34:51.727,01:34:53.480,"What's up, Warren?"
01:34:53.480,01:34:55.148,You good?
01:34:55.148,01:34:56.774,All right.
01:34:56.774,01:34:58.734,What's up?
01:34:58.734,01:35:00.736,"What's goin' on, man?"
01:35:00.736,01:35:03.573,"So, look, I listened to your demo."
01:35:04.073,01:35:05.699,It was tight.
01:35:06.993,01:35:09.579,You see that little look he gave me?
01:35:09.579,01:35:11.581,"Yo, yo, yo. Hold up."
01:35:11.581,01:35:13.041,Who the fuck is this guy?
01:35:13.041,01:35:15.960,"Oh, my bad, Suge."
01:35:15.960,01:35:18.630,"Snoop D-O-double-G, cuz."
01:35:18.630,01:35:20.507,What?
01:35:20.507,01:35:24.886,"Ho, ho! Hey, hey!"
01:35:24.886,01:35:26.762,He ain't with me.
01:35:26.762,01:35:28.306,"Nah. He's here to work, all right?"
01:35:28.306,01:35:30.475,"This is business, Suge."
01:35:30.475,01:35:33.269,"Anyway, what's this you workin' on, cuz?"
01:35:33.269,01:35:36.606,"So look, you know, it's a new track for this new movie."
01:35:36.606,01:35:38.066,It's called Deep Cover.
01:35:38.066,01:35:41.444,Ooh. Ooh-wee.
01:35:41.444,01:35:44.780,"Yeah, a movie, man."
01:35:44.780,01:35:46.991,You think you can get down on it?
01:35:46.991,01:35:50.453,"Oh, most definitely."
01:35:50.453,01:35:52.080,All right.
01:35:53.789,01:35:59.795,to what you feel It's perhaps the most notorious police brutality case...
01:35:59.795,01:36:01.464,in recent memory.
01:36:01.464,01:36:03.717,Those blows from Officer Powell...
01:36:03.717,01:36:05.176,and Officer Wind's batons...
01:36:05.176,01:36:10.557,continued and continued for no just reason.
01:36:10.557,01:36:14.185,They just let them people do whatever the hell they want.
01:36:14.185,01:36:16.812,Rodney King's leg and facial bones were broken.
01:36:16.812,01:36:19.023,Three of the four accused officers took the stand...
01:36:19.023,01:36:21.109,and admitted that it was brutal...
01:36:21.109,01:36:23.945,but said police work is brutal and that the videotape...
01:36:23.945,01:36:25.071,Here.
01:36:25.071,01:36:27.198,Who is it?
01:36:27.198,01:36:28.824,You watchin' this shit upstairs?
01:36:28.824,01:36:31.119,Hello?
01:36:31.119,01:36:32.995,We gotta talk about these contracts.
01:36:32.995,01:36:35.081,Why you don't talk to Jerry about that shit?
01:36:35.081,01:36:36.832,I don't wanna talk to Jerry.
01:36:36.832,01:36:39.043,It's your company.
01:36:39.043,01:36:40.836,All right.
01:36:40.836,01:36:42.547,"Whatever, man."
01:36:42.547,01:36:44.382,I'll be through there.
01:36:45.841,01:36:48.010,"He had it in a power swing, and he..."
01:36:48.010,01:36:49.887,Who was that?
01:36:49.887,01:36:53.891,"...right across the top of the cheekbone, splitting his face from the top of his ear to his chin."
01:36:56.978,01:36:59.105,Where Dre at?
01:36:59.105,01:37:00.856,You said he was gonna be here.
01:37:00.856,01:37:03.151,I'll get with you outside.
01:37:03.151,01:37:05.111,Don't worry about Dre.
01:37:05.111,01:37:08.657,"Truth be told, he got nothin' to do with this."
01:37:14.870,01:37:16.623,This what's gonna happen.
01:37:17.873,01:37:22.128,"You gonna sign these, releasing Dre and D.O.C."
01:37:26.882,01:37:28.468,"Whatever, homey."
01:37:31.887,01:37:34.890,"You think I'm signing that, you crazier than I thought you was."
01:37:34.890,01:37:36.559,I'm out.
01:37:40.313,01:37:42.898,Get your ass up.
01:37:42.898,01:37:46.027,Nah. I think you're gonna stay here for a while.
01:37:46.027,01:37:48.321,"Fuck you, Suge!"
01:37:48.321,01:37:50.198,Y'all niggas don't scare me.
01:37:50.198,01:37:54.952,"You can talk tough all you want, but this ain't no record."
01:37:54.952,01:37:56.912,"Don't make me change you, Eric."
01:37:56.912,01:37:58.790,Fuck that's supposed to mean?
01:37:58.790,01:38:01.042,Keep talkin'.
01:38:01.042,01:38:04.295,"Nah, nah."
01:38:04.295,01:38:06.715,You know where the fuck I'm from.
01:38:06.715,01:38:08.882,"This Bompton, nigga."
01:38:31.280,01:38:33.282,"Oh, my fucking God."
01:38:33.282,01:38:36.202,Eric.
01:38:36.202,01:38:38.371,"God, what's going on, man?"
01:38:38.371,01:38:40.665,Are you okay?
01:38:40.665,01:38:44.001,I gotta kill this motherfucker Suge Knight.
01:38:45.879,01:38:48.464,"I just came here to let you know, 'cause..."
01:38:48.464,01:38:49.965,shit might get a little thick.
01:38:49.965,01:38:52.260,I need to stay protected.
01:38:53.219,01:38:56.598,"No, you're not gonna do that. No."
01:38:56.598,01:38:58.974,I didn't come here to ask for permission.
01:38:58.974,01:39:01.770,I came here to let you know.
01:39:01.770,01:39:05.481,You wanted to be involved with this gangster shit?
01:39:05.481,01:39:09.985,"You do that, and you're gonna ruin everything we've worked for."
01:39:11.613,01:39:13.989,You really think I got a fucking choice?
01:39:13.989,01:39:15.825,Look at my face!
01:39:17.493,01:39:20.329,This the streets.
01:39:20.329,01:39:22.707,Came at us!
01:39:22.707,01:39:24.793,"If I don't hit back, we finished. It's over."
01:39:24.793,01:39:26.669,I'm not saying that we're not gonna hit back.
01:39:26.669,01:39:28.630,But this is not Compton...
01:39:29.839,01:39:31.424,if you haven't looked around.
01:39:31.424,01:39:34.009,"Drop that shit, okay?"
01:39:34.009,01:39:37.221,We don't hit back with bullets.
01:39:37.221,01:39:40.433,We drain these assholes.
01:39:40.433,01:39:43.394,"It ain't about the money, Jerry."
01:39:44.562,01:39:46.648,I don't care about no money.
01:39:46.648,01:39:48.858,And you should fucking care about the money.
01:39:50.025,01:39:52.986,You're so much smarter than these fucking thugs.
01:39:52.986,01:39:56.282,You wanna kill somebody?
01:39:59.285,01:40:02.037,"No more family, no more Ruthless, no more anything."
01:40:02.037,01:40:04.039,"If you kill this man, his problems will be over..."
01:40:04.039,01:40:06.793,and yours will just be beginning.
01:40:06.793,01:40:08.878,Don't be a fucking fool.
01:40:09.629,01:40:11.046,Hey.
01:40:12.256,01:40:15.050,Why the fuck I gotta be the bigger man?
01:40:16.177,01:40:18.429,'Cause it's better than you being a dead man.
01:40:18.429,01:40:20.598,I don't want you fucking dead.
01:40:46.875,01:40:49.961,"Damn, Dre."
01:40:49.961,01:40:51.379,"Yeah, you feelin' it?"
01:40:51.379,01:40:53.756,"Hey, hey, look, I'm gonna spit a little something."
01:40:53.756,01:40:56.091,"You feel me? You say whatever-- You just jump in, nigga, and just..."
01:40:56.091,01:40:58.051,Hold on.
01:41:08.730,01:41:17.112,so I could bust and Long Beach together Uh-huh.
01:41:17.112,01:41:19.699,Uh-huh.
01:41:22.243,01:41:24.954,Ooh!
01:41:28.123,01:41:30.501,for having us here.
01:41:30.501,01:41:33.086,Very generous for you to give of your time...
01:41:33.086,01:41:35.381,"with, uh, everything that's going on right now."
01:41:35.381,01:41:37.090,Not a problem.
01:41:37.090,01:41:42.179,"Now, if I may-- Are you anti-Semitic?"
01:41:42.179,01:41:44.891,"Now, I thought this was about the Rodney King trial."
01:41:44.891,01:41:50.021,"Well, the JDL recently got involved, citing the lyrics about your former manager, Jerry Heller."
01:41:50.021,01:41:51.564,I'm not anti-Semitic.
01:41:51.564,01:41:54.692,I'm anti-Jerry Heller.
01:41:54.692,01:41:58.529,Do the JDL condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation?
01:41:58.529,01:42:02.075,Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation?
01:42:02.075,01:42:04.786,-I have no idea.
01:42:04.786,01:42:07.455,"But when you got that for me, we can continue on this topic."
01:42:07.455,01:42:09.164,"Until then, I'm here to talk..."
01:42:09.164,01:42:15.421,"about the beating of an unarmed motorist, Rodney King, and four guilty LAPD officers..."
01:42:15.421,01:42:18.215,who seem to be Daryl Gates's standard issue.
01:42:19.425,01:42:21.636,It's also the LAPD and the FBI...
01:42:21.636,01:42:24.639,who feel that your negative portrayal of police condones violence.
01:42:24.639,01:42:27.642,"Fuck tha Police is just a warning, that's it."
01:42:27.642,01:42:31.186,You can't treat people like that and expect 'em not to rise up.
01:42:31.186,01:42:35.441,I'm a journalist just like you-- reporting what's goin' on in the hood.
01:42:35.441,01:42:38.527,The only thing that's different is that I'm brutally honest.
01:42:40.905,01:42:43.156,And what's your relationship with the Nation of Islam?
01:42:44.241,01:42:46.159,They my brothers.
01:42:46.159,01:42:48.203,You know what?
01:42:48.203,01:42:51.164,what kind of a unprepared sandbag reporter you are.
01:42:51.164,01:42:55.210,"You talkin' to me like I'm some elected official, like I'm running for office."
01:42:55.210,01:42:57.212,But I get it.
01:42:57.212,01:42:59.757,"Bigger the story, the bigger the check in your field of work."
01:42:59.757,01:43:01.759,It's not your fault.
01:43:01.759,01:43:04.720,"What's your name, man?"
01:43:04.720,01:43:08.141,"Eat a dick, Brian."
01:43:09.142,01:43:11.352,"Can we cut, please?"
01:43:42.466,01:43:45.260,"Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me."
01:43:45.260,01:43:46.721,You look like you're ready to go.
01:43:46.721,01:43:49.891,Yeah. I'm just waiting on my friend.
01:43:49.891,01:43:53.853,You're not havin' a good time?
01:43:53.853,01:43:56.689,But now it's starting to get a little wild.
01:43:56.689,01:43:59.942,Yeah. We've been known to get crazy from time to time.
01:44:01.903,01:44:05.198,I'm Andre.
01:44:06.824,01:44:07.909,Suge.
01:44:07.909,01:44:09.869,How you doin'?
01:44:09.869,01:44:11.453,"Jimmy Iovine, Interscope Records."
01:44:11.453,01:44:13.288,Nice to meet you.
01:44:13.288,01:44:16.417,"So, what do I call you?"
01:44:16.417,01:44:18.293,"Nah, Dre is cool."
01:44:18.293,01:44:20.213,Go ahead.
01:44:20.213,01:44:21.672,It's good.
01:44:21.672,01:44:24.800,"-So, what do you got today?"
01:44:21.672,01:44:26.343,"-Um-- Well, you know."
01:44:26.343,01:44:29.847,I heard John McClain gave you my album.
01:44:29.847,01:44:31.766,What'd you think?
01:44:31.766,01:44:35.477,"I don't know anything about hip-hop, but I know that this is special."
01:44:35.477,01:44:37.270,Seriously.
01:44:38.522,01:44:40.273,Thank you.
01:44:40.273,01:44:44.153,"Look, we'd love to bring in Interscope, but there's a little problem."
01:44:44.153,01:44:45.613,What's the problem?
01:44:45.613,01:44:48.241,"Ruthless, lawsuits..."
01:44:48.241,01:44:50.325,and contracts.
01:44:50.325,01:44:52.327,"Well, how about this?"
01:44:52.327,01:44:55.206,"You give me three weeks, and I don't wanna hear any bullshit..."
01:44:55.206,01:44:56.999,about you shopping this anywhere around town.
01:44:56.999,01:45:03.005,"If you do that, I believe I can solve your problem with the contract."
01:45:07.342,01:45:09.220,"Lil' nigga, you in my spot?"
01:45:10.429,01:45:12.347,Yo.
01:45:12.347,01:45:15.392,Suge.
01:45:12.347,01:45:18.020,"Easy, man, yo-- Hey, Suge, what the-- Hey, Suge."
01:45:18.020,01:45:20.313,"I didn't-- I didn't know, man."
01:45:20.313,01:45:21.899,You little fuck!
01:45:21.899,01:45:23.151,Suge!
01:45:25.486,01:45:28.072,"Suge, it's just a parking spot."
01:45:28.072,01:45:29.615,Come on!
01:45:32.952,01:45:35.288,Move this piece of shit.
01:45:36.747,01:45:39.292,And park my car.
01:45:39.292,01:45:41.752,And I better not see one drop of blood on that motherfucker.
01:45:41.752,01:45:43.462,"Suge, let's go, man."
01:45:49.635,01:45:55.516,"The jury in the Rodney King case has delivered its verdict, and not one of the four police officers..."
01:45:55.516,01:45:58.393,seen on videotape beating Mr. King a year ago...
01:45:58.393,01:46:00.229,is guilty of using excessive force.
01:46:00.229,01:46:01.856,They've all been found not guilty.
01:46:01.856,01:46:03.774,"Oh, for Christ's sake."
01:46:03.774,01:46:06.068,"Oh, my God."
01:46:06.068,01:46:08.403,"Peter, it was a clean sweep for the defendants."
01:46:08.403,01:46:10.281,"Not guilty, the verdict for all of them."
01:46:10.281,01:46:12.407,Only on one count against Lawrence Powell...
01:46:12.407,01:46:14.535,on excessive use of force under color of authority...
01:46:14.535,01:46:17.412,could the jury not agree.
01:46:19.248,01:46:22.835,the worst case of police misconduct that I've ever seen.
01:46:22.835,01:46:24.419,Fuck the police!
01:46:24.419,01:46:27.298,Fuck the police!
01:46:27.298,01:46:29.424,... especially to our police department.
01:46:29.424,01:46:33.262,It looks kind of like we're in a war zone though.
01:46:33.262,01:46:35.806,"We've got some courageous shop owners here, who are armed."
01:46:35.806,01:46:40.311,is obviously a statement of political dissatisfaction.
01:46:40.311,01:46:42.104,Police officers are still back down...
01:46:42.104,01:46:44.857,guarding the area down there where the Ralph's...
01:46:44.857,01:46:46.859,"...the police are using, eerily reminiscent..."
01:46:46.859,01:46:48.443,of military-style assault weapons.
01:46:48.443,01:46:51.197,You can hear random gunshots as rioters...
01:46:51.197,01:46:54.407,"have been left abandoned, because their drivers..."
01:46:55.701,01:46:58.329,"We show you, and that police presence..."
01:46:58.329,01:47:01.040,We have fires burning.
01:47:02.250,01:47:04.459,Olympic. Pico.
01:47:04.459,01:47:06.587,"No justice, no peace!"
01:47:06.587,01:47:11.259,"More than 100 injured, mostly in the South-Central section of Los Angeles."
01:47:35.116,01:47:38.493,"You know, if we bag all this shit up in ounces, we should probably be straight."
01:47:38.493,01:47:40.495,Looks like we got enough.
01:47:40.495,01:47:43.040,"So, all this weed is for your Ruthless artists?"
01:47:43.040,01:47:47.460,"I'm tryin' to take care of these little money problems, man, so-- They can smoke it, sell it."
01:47:47.460,01:47:49.297,"Fuck, throw a party on it, for all I give a fuck."
01:47:49.297,01:47:53.426,"As long as I just have some time to figure this shit out, you know?"
01:47:54.593,01:47:58.347,"Yo, man, you straight?"
01:47:59.390,01:48:01.267,"E, you straight?"
01:48:01.267,01:48:04.519,"-No, for real, man."
01:48:04.519,01:48:07.522,"I'm just fucking tired, man."
01:48:07.522,01:48:10.151,How would you feel?
01:48:10.151,01:48:12.403,Dre rolled out.
01:48:12.403,01:48:14.780,Tomica asking me all kind of questions about the house.
01:48:14.780,01:48:18.367,Answer me this.
01:48:18.367,01:48:20.786,Would you be all right moving out your fucking house?
01:48:20.786,01:48:22.704,You all right with it?
01:48:22.704,01:48:25.207,I'm-- I'm in this shit with you.
01:48:25.207,01:48:27.084,"I'm just trying to make sure you good, bruh."
01:48:27.084,01:48:28.877,I'm good!
01:48:28.877,01:48:30.545,You good?
01:48:30.545,01:48:32.173,Eric.
01:48:32.173,01:48:34.258,"-What, Jerry?"
01:48:34.258,01:48:36.385,You know what?
01:48:36.385,01:48:38.511,"I have stuff needs your autograph, okay?"
01:48:39.721,01:48:42.515,"I'll come when I have time, Jerry."
01:48:45.353,01:48:46.812,We still got a business to run.
01:48:46.812,01:48:48.689,Don't it look like I'm running business right now?
01:48:48.689,01:48:50.816,No. It looks like you're fucking cutting up weed.
01:48:50.816,01:48:53.861,I thought that was a job for fucking jackasses.
01:48:56.113,01:48:57.906,"You know what, Jerry?"
01:48:59.116,01:49:00.742,You right.
01:49:00.742,01:49:03.745,You absolutely fuckin' right.
01:49:03.745,01:49:06.248,We got business to take care of.
01:49:07.041,01:49:09.251,I'll see you in a minute.
01:49:14.715,01:49:19.094,You got knocked the fuck out.
01:49:22.014,01:49:23.598,That shit is funny.
01:49:23.598,01:49:25.184,"Hey, baby."
01:49:25.184,01:49:26.643,How's Friday coming?
01:49:26.643,01:49:28.603,This shit is funny.
01:49:28.603,01:49:30.022,I'm feeling it though.
01:49:30.022,01:49:32.316,Hmm.
01:49:32.316,01:49:33.775,100.
01:49:33.775,01:49:35.694,I'm not going too much longer though.
01:49:35.694,01:49:37.612,"Baby, come here."
01:49:40.157,01:49:41.783,Look how young y'all are.
01:49:48.082,01:49:50.459,Dang!
01:49:50.459,01:49:52.627,What?
01:49:52.627,01:49:54.963,We left a lot of good records on the table.
01:50:30.916,01:50:33.668,It's like I don't even know what I'm doing no more.
01:50:33.668,01:50:36.464,I don't know where the money going.
01:50:36.464,01:50:38.299,Why you stressin'?
01:50:38.299,01:50:40.259,You know I know the business.
01:50:40.259,01:50:47.349,"Just-- Shit, just lay out all the files, contracts, whatever it is, and I'll look into it."
01:50:47.349,01:50:50.018,For real.
01:50:52.480,01:50:53.897,Come here.
01:51:00.404,01:51:03.157,You just go to New York.
01:51:03.157,01:51:07.869,You take care of this big ol' distribution deal with Sony.
01:51:07.869,01:51:10.705,Bring that shit on in.
01:51:10.705,01:51:12.665,All right?
01:51:12.665,01:51:14.667,And I'll check into everything else.
01:51:18.964,01:51:20.673,I love you.
01:51:20.673,01:51:22.926,You what?
01:51:22.926,01:51:25.137,You what?
01:51:28.557,01:51:30.434,What's up?
01:51:30.434,01:51:33.562,All right.
01:51:33.562,01:51:36.940,"Oh, whoa, whoa."
01:51:36.940,01:51:38.651,You okay to drive?
01:51:39.734,01:51:42.571,No.
01:51:42.571,01:51:44.490,"Good night, Andre."
01:51:44.490,01:51:49.744,"See-- See, I can't help thinking maybe you want me to come inside."
01:51:49.744,01:51:51.330,Of course I do.
01:51:51.330,01:51:53.957,"So, what's different now? Huh?"
01:51:53.957,01:51:56.751,I got a lot to think about.
01:51:56.751,01:52:01.382,You're asking me to move in with you.
01:52:01.382,01:52:05.927,"I like you, Andre, but there's a lot going on around you."
01:52:05.927,01:52:07.720,What you mean?
01:52:08.763,01:52:14.395,"I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting."
01:52:14.395,01:52:16.771,Just seems dangerous.
01:52:16.771,01:52:19.692,My son is my world.
01:52:23.237,01:52:25.197,I hear you.
01:52:30.952,01:52:32.705,Good night.
01:53:02.817,01:53:19.834,"the sweetest joy in the rap game What up, Dre?"
01:53:19.834,01:53:21.503,"What up, Pac?"
01:53:21.503,01:53:23.714,I'm about to bust niggas in the mouth with this new album.
01:53:23.714,01:53:25.507,"Okay, I feel that."
01:53:25.507,01:53:28.009,Suge said you got some heat for a nigga.
01:53:28.009,01:53:30.387,Play that for him.
01:53:38.853,01:53:40.522,Yeah.

01:53:54.869,01:53:56.538,"Hey, hold on, Pac."
01:53:56.538,01:53:58.791,"Stay right there, man."

01:54:15.516,01:54:17.892,"-Chop, chop. Chop."

01:54:34.117,01:54:36.911,Bring your bitch-ass up.
01:54:36.911,01:54:38.497,Tighty-whitey-ass nigga.
01:54:40.415,01:54:41.916,You know what to do.
01:54:46.129,01:54:47.840,I'd like to make a toast.
01:54:47.840,01:54:50.801,-To what?
01:54:50.801,01:54:52.260,Death Row!
01:54:52.260,01:54:55.305,"And Suge, for making all this happen."
01:54:57.932,01:55:00.602,And may the West Coast reign forever.
01:55:00.602,01:55:03.188,Come on.
01:55:03.188,01:55:06.358,And may the West Coast reign forever.
01:55:06.358,01:55:08.943,Now toast to Dr. Dre.
01:55:08.943,01:55:10.945,That's right.
01:55:12.656,01:55:14.700,"I said, put the fucking glasses down!"
01:55:14.700,01:55:17.118,"Hey, yo, slow your roll, Dre."
01:55:17.118,01:55:19.621,This why we got money?
01:55:19.621,01:55:21.707,To act like we ain't got no goddamn sense?
01:55:21.707,01:55:24.918,We coulda did all this dumb shit back in Compton.
01:55:24.918,01:55:27.379,But this what the fuck y'all turn into.
01:55:27.379,01:55:30.924,You sittin' up here eatin' fuckin' crab.
01:55:32.843,01:55:36.012,"This my motherfucking name on the wall, man!"

01:55:56.825,01:55:59.202,We can do anything we wanna do.
01:55:59.202,01:56:01.996,We started this thing.
01:56:01.996,01:56:04.082,"Nah, nigga."
01:56:05.584,01:56:07.836,I don't know what the fuck this shit is.
01:56:09.003,01:56:11.005,"Better watch your mouth, blood."
01:56:11.005,01:56:13.007,"And who the fuck you talking to, huh?"
01:56:13.007,01:56:16.136,"Nigga, you ain't nothin' but a producer."
01:56:16.136,01:56:19.848,"-Yo, yo, yo!"
01:56:19.848,01:56:22.643,-Dude!

01:56:50.671,01:56:52.547,Always fucking with me!
01:57:30.377,01:57:32.796,Drop the keys out of the window!
01:57:32.796,01:57:34.047,Open the door.
01:57:36.174,01:57:38.218,Step out of the vehicle.
01:57:38.218,01:57:40.387,Hands in the air.
01:57:40.387,01:57:42.931,Keep 'em up.
01:57:45.058,01:57:47.394,Turn around.
01:57:47.394,01:57:49.229,Fingers behind your head.
01:57:49.229,01:57:52.065,Hold it right there.
01:58:00.114,01:58:01.867,"Hey, that's Eazy."
01:58:03.869,01:58:07.622,"What's up, E?"
01:58:07.622,01:58:09.958,"Hey, what's up?"
01:58:12.126,01:58:13.754,Nah.
01:58:13.754,01:58:16.214,"Hey, hey. Hold up."
01:58:17.507,01:58:19.760,"Cube, I just heard you was over here."
01:58:30.144,01:58:32.105,"Yeah, I'm here."
01:58:32.105,01:58:33.648,What you need?
01:58:35.609,01:58:39.320,"Everybody to calm the fuck down, from the looks of it."
01:58:39.320,01:58:41.406,"I mean, I was just in the neighborhood, man."
01:58:41.406,01:58:44.534,I came here with Bone Thugs.
01:58:45.493,01:58:47.120,What's up?
01:58:47.871,01:58:50.164,I saw Boyz n the Hood.
01:58:50.164,01:58:51.666,It was good.
01:58:51.666,01:58:55.045,You ain't called that shit a after-school special?
01:58:57.798,01:59:01.301,"I like after-school specials, Cube."
01:59:08.516,01:59:10.560,"What's up, man?"
01:59:10.560,01:59:12.729,How you feel?
01:59:12.729,01:59:14.188,"Hell, yeah, nigga, I'm good."
01:59:14.188,01:59:16.566,It's good to see you.
01:59:16.566,01:59:19.987,It's good to see you right now.
01:59:19.987,01:59:22.823,Pull your fuckin' homies off me then if it's good to see me.
01:59:22.823,01:59:26.200,You had niggas jump us.
01:59:26.200,01:59:29.037,How you go from selling rocks in the dope house...
01:59:29.037,01:59:31.498,to having dinner in the White House with the president?
01:59:31.498,01:59:33.959,They still trying to figure that shit out.
01:59:35.502,01:59:40.007,"But, hey, all publicity-- Is good publicity."
01:59:40.007,01:59:42.216,-You know it.
01:59:42.216,01:59:43.760,Man.
01:59:43.760,01:59:49.223,"Look, man, I-- I wish that dumb shit really would've never popped off between us."
01:59:49.223,01:59:51.351,We shouldn't have dissed each other in the first place.
01:59:51.351,01:59:54.688,Making the fans choose between us?
01:59:55.772,01:59:57.190,You right.
01:59:59.233,02:00:02.487,You ever think we'd be that big though?
02:00:02.487,02:00:06.324,I was just talking to my wife about that-- how it was in the beginning.
02:00:06.324,02:00:08.827,"Shit, we just wanted to do music for the neighborhood."
02:00:08.827,02:00:10.871,Be ghetto stars.
02:00:10.871,02:00:14.791,But what if we had the chance to find out...
02:00:14.791,02:00:16.292,how big we could really be?
02:00:16.292,02:00:18.670,"Come on, man, you got my mind workin'."
02:00:18.670,02:00:21.255,I be thinking about that shit all the time.
02:00:21.255,02:00:24.342,If we could just take that shit back to '89.
02:00:24.342,02:00:27.261,I hear you.
02:00:27.261,02:00:30.264,It was hard then.
02:00:30.264,02:00:33.226,where I almost wish we was gettin' arrested in Detroit again.
02:00:33.226,02:00:34.895,Shit. You know?
02:00:34.895,02:00:37.271,Shit ain't gotta stop there.
02:00:37.271,02:00:41.275,"But if we go do this, we gotta do it right."
02:00:41.275,02:00:44.112,"And if Dre with it, I'm with it."
02:00:44.112,02:00:47.281,But I don't know your relationship with dude.
02:00:47.281,02:00:50.660,"But if you want me, Eric, Jerry can't be there."
02:00:55.289,02:00:58.292,All right.
02:00:58.292,02:01:01.838,"Hey, man."
02:01:01.838,02:01:03.924,Shit.
02:01:03.924,02:01:06.384,"Man, whatever."
02:01:06.384,02:01:08.302,But I hear you.
02:01:08.302,02:01:09.846,Yeah?
02:01:10.931,02:01:13.558,You said it.
02:01:13.558,02:01:16.811,These invoices haven't been paid.
02:01:16.811,02:01:19.022,They're two or three years outdated.
02:01:19.022,02:01:21.983,These are canceled checks.
02:01:21.983,02:01:24.318,And these are past due.
02:01:24.318,02:01:27.739,Jerry took advantage of you.
02:01:27.739,02:01:32.368,"I know it's a lot, but you had to know the truth sometime."
02:01:32.368,02:01:34.037,Now you do.
02:01:35.914,02:01:39.542,"You know, Dre and Cube tried to warn me about this."
02:01:41.211,02:01:44.005,I've been fuckin' up for a long time.
02:01:48.218,02:01:49.677,Don't. Don't.
02:01:49.677,02:01:51.679,A really long time.
02:01:54.808,02:01:57.185,Shit.
02:02:14.953,02:02:16.997,"Hey, man."
02:02:19.916,02:02:22.043,Where you been?
02:02:22.043,02:02:24.337,I've been calling you all day.
02:02:25.797,02:02:27.841,"Sit down, Jerry."
02:02:31.678,02:02:34.388,What is this all about?
02:02:34.388,02:02:37.058,The executive assistant?
02:02:38.392,02:02:40.478,She even go to college?
02:02:40.478,02:02:43.606,"Man, you're so much fucking smarter than this."
02:02:43.606,02:02:45.275,"Sit down, Jerry."
02:03:06.171,02:03:08.381,"This ain't about Tomica, Jerry."
02:03:09.423,02:03:11.218,This about you.
02:03:11.218,02:03:13.386,And you can stop acting like you ain't never done nothin' wrong.
02:03:13.386,02:03:15.763,"You know what, man?"
02:03:15.763,02:03:17.390,I understand.
02:03:18.432,02:03:22.436,"But I'm asking you-- I'm advising you, take a breath, okay?"
02:03:22.436,02:03:24.356,"I'm gonna look at the paperwork, Eric."
02:03:24.356,02:03:27.901,It's fucked up.
02:03:29.236,02:03:30.695,Here's what's about to happen.
02:03:30.695,02:03:32.697,I'm gonna get N.W.A.
02:03:30.695,02:03:35.449,"back together, and you ain't gonna have nothin' to do with it this time."
02:03:37.493,02:03:39.662,How the fuck can you even say something like that?
02:03:39.662,02:03:42.790,"What the fuck is going on with you, man?"
02:03:42.790,02:03:44.918,I know what's good for you.
02:03:44.918,02:03:46.920,I know what's good for Ruthless.
02:03:46.920,02:03:52.508,"And we have worked up a trust after years of hard work, and that trust is our foundation, Eric."
02:03:52.508,02:03:54.802,I don't give a shit.
02:03:58.390,02:04:01.434,"You look lousy, man."
02:04:02.352,02:04:03.770,Trust?
02:04:04.896,02:04:07.190,Trust is a motherfucker.
02:04:08.482,02:04:10.110,Is it?
02:04:10.110,02:04:12.570,Let me ask you something.
02:04:12.570,02:04:17.491,"Eric, if what I'm doing is so illegal, how come I've never been sued, hmm?"
02:04:17.491,02:04:23.497,"If I'm such a fucking thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's ever come to collect?"
02:04:23.497,02:04:27.294,"Because this is business, and this is how it works."
02:04:27.294,02:04:29.503,And it's not always pretty. No.
02:04:29.503,02:04:33.507,Do I cover my own ass?
02:04:33.507,02:04:35.509,But don't you dare fucking tell me...
02:04:35.509,02:04:37.511,that I have not taken care of you.
02:04:37.511,02:04:39.264,Don't you fucking tell me...
02:04:39.264,02:04:42.183,that I have not had your back from day one!
02:04:42.183,02:04:43.977,Day one!
02:04:48.398,02:04:50.942,Is this taking care of me?
02:04:50.942,02:04:52.610,Are you fucking kidding me?
02:04:52.610,02:04:54.570,It's taking care of the whole fucking thing.
02:04:54.570,02:04:57.531,It's business!
02:04:57.531,02:05:01.328,Have I covered my end?
02:05:01.328,02:05:05.832,But don't you dare fucking tell me that I have not taken care of you.
02:05:07.417,02:05:09.169,This business too?
02:05:09.169,02:05:10.628,Yes.
02:05:10.628,02:05:12.505,This is how fucked up it can get.
02:05:12.505,02:05:15.549,But I didn't start this.
02:05:15.549,02:05:17.093,You did!
02:05:18.552,02:05:20.221,No.
02:05:21.764,02:05:23.557,You did.
02:05:25.143,02:05:26.602,"You fired, Jerry."
02:05:26.602,02:05:30.231,"Oh, for Christ-- Eric, this isn't how we do things."
02:05:30.231,02:05:34.152,This is not you.
02:05:35.569,02:05:37.238,This is an important company.
02:05:37.238,02:05:40.074,"Eric, I'm not gonna let you fuck this up."
02:05:40.074,02:05:41.993,Eric?
02:05:41.993,02:05:44.454,"Oh, for Christ's sake, Eric!"
02:05:56.174,02:05:57.925,"Yeah, hello?"
02:05:57.925,02:05:59.677,"Yeah, what up, Dre?"
02:05:59.677,02:06:01.595,Who this?
02:06:01.595,02:06:04.640,E?
02:06:04.640,02:06:07.643,Yeah. Okay.
02:06:07.643,02:06:09.354,What's up?
02:06:09.354,02:06:12.148,"I mean, you know me, man."
02:06:12.148,02:06:14.567,Killin' all this pussy.
02:06:15.776,02:06:17.611,How about you?
02:06:17.611,02:06:20.323,"I'm just making tracks, doing my thing."
02:06:23.826,02:06:32.585,"Look, Dre, I know you be busy, but, um, I talked to Cube, and we were talking about some-- some possibilities."
02:06:33.920,02:06:36.381,Possibilities?
02:06:36.381,02:06:40.385,"Yeah, like, without Jerry Heller type of fucking possibilities."
02:06:40.385,02:06:42.636,Really?
02:06:42.636,02:06:45.265,"Man, I mean, I know shit kinda went crazy."
02:06:45.265,02:06:54.399,"And-- You know, the money kinda had everybody divided, man, but... I really wish it didn't."
02:06:58.903,02:07:04.742,"It's, uh-- To be honest, man, I'm not proud of all the shit I did either."
02:07:10.248,02:07:13.667,"So, what you think, man?"
02:07:13.667,02:07:15.211,What you think?
02:07:18.672,02:07:20.425,"Yeah, man."
02:07:21.217,02:07:23.010,"Yeah, that sound good."
02:07:24.262,02:07:26.389,"Let's do it, E."
02:07:26.389,02:07:29.601,"I'm-a let you know when we can get back into the studio, you know."
02:07:29.601,02:07:32.479,"Lay down some tracks, like the old days."
02:07:34.688,02:07:37.442,Fair enough.
02:07:37.442,02:07:40.027,"It's good to hear from you, man."
02:07:42.071,02:07:43.656,All right.
02:08:14.479,02:08:16.772,"Man, y'all niggas ain't making no music in here."
02:08:16.772,02:08:18.983,Hey!
02:08:18.983,02:08:20.734,What's up? What up?
02:08:20.734,02:08:23.779,"Yo, hey, when are Dre and Cube gonna roll up in here, man? I'm ready!"
02:08:23.779,02:08:26.533,'Cause I'm ready to get this new shit going.
02:08:26.533,02:08:27.950,I'm ready too.
02:08:27.950,02:08:31.287,"But long as we stay ready, we gonna know we gonna be on, man."
02:08:31.287,02:08:33.998,Y'all already know this new N.W.A. shit about to be crazy.
02:08:33.998,02:08:36.750,"Here ya go, baby."
02:08:36.750,02:08:39.712,I got libraries of new shit.
02:08:39.712,02:08:41.297,That's what I'm talking about.
02:08:41.297,02:08:43.799,I got the tracks.
02:08:43.799,02:08:45.801,Mm-hmm.
02:08:45.801,02:08:47.637,"Hell, yeah."
02:08:47.637,02:08:49.805,You think you Dre now?
02:08:49.805,02:08:51.765,I'm trying to murder Dre.
02:08:51.765,02:08:54.977,I'm about to murder both of y'all on the track though.
02:08:54.977,02:08:56.812,Check me out.
02:08:56.812,02:08:59.106,You know you don't play no instruments.
02:09:02.569,02:09:04.278,You gonna play it?
02:09:06.614,02:09:08.241,"E, you all right?"
02:09:09.033,02:09:10.702,Eric.
02:09:11.744,02:09:13.454,"Baby, you good?"
02:09:14.539,02:09:15.998,Yeah.
02:09:15.998,02:09:17.709,I'm all right.
02:09:20.794,02:09:22.505,Eric! Eric!
02:09:22.505,02:09:24.090,Call 911.
02:09:24.090,02:09:26.384,"Eric. Get up, man."
02:09:26.384,02:09:28.302,"Yo, call 911."
02:09:28.302,02:09:30.804,"You all right, E?"
02:09:30.804,02:09:33.057,"Eazy, wake up."
02:09:33.057,02:09:35.727,"Yes, we need an ambulance."
02:09:50.824,02:09:54.495,Wait. Ain't you gonna say something?
02:09:54.495,02:09:57.707,What is it?
02:09:57.707,02:10:01.835,"Yes, well, um, it is those things and more, I'm afraid."
02:10:01.835,02:10:03.837,We ran a full blood battery.
02:10:03.837,02:10:10.886,"And, uh-- I'm sorry, Mr. Wright, but, uh, you've tested positive for HIV."
02:10:12.846,02:10:15.099,Get the fuck outta here.
02:10:15.099,02:10:19.186,A normal T-cell count is anywhere between 500 and 1500.
02:10:19.186,02:10:21.397,"Right now, your T-cell count is 14."
02:10:26.152,02:10:27.861,But I ain't no faggot.
02:10:27.861,02:10:34.827,"Mr. Wright, actually, um, the virus can be transmitted in quite a few ways, including unprotected heterosexual sex."
02:10:39.039,02:10:40.874,Uh-- That's wrong.
02:10:40.874,02:10:43.877,You-You gotta test that over.
02:10:43.877,02:10:46.756,We've run the test five times with five different samples...
02:10:46.756,02:10:48.424,and the result remains the same.
02:10:48.424,02:10:49.467,Tomica.
02:10:51.678,02:10:53.137,Tomica.
02:10:53.137,02:10:56.140,"But she's pregnant, Doc."
02:10:56.140,02:10:59.644,It doesn't necessarily mean that she's contracted the virus.
02:10:59.644,02:11:02.522,"But, uh, we have to test her to be sure."
02:11:02.522,02:11:05.107,"So, what do we do?"
02:11:05.107,02:11:07.901,"I mean, what-- I gotta get healthy."
02:11:07.901,02:11:11.405,I got things to do.
02:11:07.901,02:11:13.491,I got-- Wha-What are we supposed to do?
02:11:13.491,02:11:15.075,Mr. Wright.
02:11:15.075,02:11:18.287,"You need to understand that you are very, very sick."
02:11:18.287,02:11:20.373,"But I don't even feel that bad, Doc."
02:11:20.373,02:11:21.999,Don't tell me that.
02:11:21.999,02:11:25.461,"With care and palliative care, we can probably keep you comfortable..."
02:11:25.461,02:11:28.715,"for, uh, maybe six months, at the very most."
02:11:28.715,02:11:32.176,Comfortable?
02:11:35.805,02:11:37.515,It's just a matter of time.
02:11:39.350,02:11:43.979,"I am-- I'm truly, truly sorry, Mr. Wright."
02:11:43.979,02:11:47.900,"I'll-I'll leave you time to, um, process this."
02:11:50.236,02:11:52.946,"Come on, Doc."
