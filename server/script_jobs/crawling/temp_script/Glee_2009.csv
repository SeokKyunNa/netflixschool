00:00:29.530,00:00:30.906,You think this is hard?
00:00:30.989,00:00:32.533,Try being waterboarded. That's hard.
00:00:43.001,00:00:45.546,"Hey, guys."
00:00:45.629,00:00:48.882,"MAN: Making some new friends, Kurt?"
00:00:48.966,00:00:50.676,"He sure is, Mr. Schue."
00:00:50.759,00:00:53.929,"Hey, Finn, you still owe me that report on Que hace en su verano pasado."
00:00:54.012,00:00:56.139,-What? -What you did last summer.
00:00:56.223,00:00:59.434,"Almost halfway done with almost all of it, Mr. Schue."
00:00:59.518,00:01:03.355,"-It's hammer time! -Please, this is from Marc Jacobs' -new collection! -Wait."
00:01:08.318,00:01:09.236,Okay.
00:01:38.390,00:01:39.349,Â¿Como esta usted?
00:01:39.433,00:01:41.435,Yo me llamo Guillermo.
00:01:41.518,00:01:42.686,ALL: Como esta usted?
00:01:42.769,00:01:44.271,Yo me llamo Guillermo.
00:01:44.354,00:01:46.857,"Que lastima, hojala que se sienta mejor."
00:01:46.940,00:01:51.653,"-Rapido. -ALL: Que lastima, hojala que se sienta mejor."
00:01:51.737,00:01:54.031,"WILL: Bueno, bueno."
00:02:32.361,00:02:33.654,WILL: Where's the coffee pot?
00:02:33.737,00:02:35.197,Figgins got rid of it.
00:02:35.280,00:02:36.323,Budget cuts.
00:02:36.406,00:02:39.785,"You know, I know for a fact that they are still getting hot java at Carver."
00:02:39.868,00:02:41.995,We should strike.
00:02:42.079,00:02:43.997,"Hello, boys."
00:02:44.081,00:02:45.499,Who needs a pick-me-up?
00:02:45.582,00:02:46.792,"Wow, lattes!"
00:02:46.875,00:02:48.210,"Yeah, I am a bit of a coffee snob."
00:02:48.293,00:02:52.631,"Now, the key to a perfect latte is in the temperature of the steamed milk."
00:02:52.714,00:02:54.800,I like mine scalding.
00:02:54.883,00:02:56.051,"Hi, Emma."
00:02:56.134,00:02:57.344,"Hey, Ken."
00:02:57.427,00:02:59.930,"-Will, hi. -Hey."
00:03:00.013,00:03:01.557,What's with all the lattes?
00:03:01.640,00:03:07.396,"Oh, Emma, I just felt so awful that Figgins cut the coffee budget to pay for a nutritionist for the Cheerios."
00:03:07.479,00:03:10.732,"Yeah, I heard you guys went, like, $600 over budget on that."
00:03:10.816,00:03:15.112,My performers didn't get on Fox Sports Net last year because they ate at Bacon Junction.
00:03:15.195,00:03:16.280,Since when are cheerleaders performers?
00:03:18.907,00:03:22.828,Your resentment is delicious.
00:03:22.911,00:03:25.539,"Well, I have a phoner in a couple of minutes."
00:03:25.622,00:03:30.711,It's an interview on the telephone I'll probably do it on my iPhone.
00:03:30.794,00:03:31.795,Enjoy.
00:03:31.879,00:03:32.963,"WILL: Thanks a lot, Sue."
00:03:36.842,00:03:40.679,"I missed you at the, uh, singles mixer last weekend, Emma."
00:03:40.762,00:03:41.972,"EMMA: Yeah, I know."
00:03:42.055,00:03:43.390,Big pipe exploded in my building.
00:03:43.473,00:03:46.435,"It was wild. I hate those mixer things, though, don't you?"
00:03:46.518,00:03:48.770,"It's like a big meat market. It's just, ugh."
00:03:48.854,00:03:50.814,I did give my number to a fireman though.
00:03:50.898,00:03:52.900,But he hasn't called.
00:03:52.983,00:03:54.109,You know what? There's someone out there for everyone.
00:03:54.193,00:03:55.235,I wouldn't even sweat it.
00:04:01.700,00:04:03.410,"Hey, did you hear that Sandy Ryerson got fired?"
00:04:03.493,00:04:05.787,-Really? -Mm-hmm.
00:04:05.871,00:04:08.290,Who's going to take over Glee Club?
00:04:08.373,00:04:09.416,Don't know.
00:04:12.252,00:04:13.545,I'd like to take over Glee Club.
00:04:13.629,00:04:15.172,"You want to captain the Titanic, too?"
00:04:15.255,00:04:16.632,I think I can make it great again.
00:04:16.715,00:04:18.008,There is no joy in these kids.
00:04:18.091,00:04:19.593,They feel invisible.
00:04:19.676,00:04:21.512,That's why every one of them has a MySpace page.
00:04:21.595,00:04:23.805,60 bucks a month.
00:04:23.889,00:04:25.641,That's what I need to keep this program up.
00:04:25.724,00:04:27.643,And you-you expect me to pay it?
00:04:27.726,00:04:29.770,I'm certainly not going to pay for it.
00:04:29.853,00:04:32.773,"We're not talking about Cheerios here, Will."
00:04:32.856,00:04:34.942,They were on Fox Sports Net last year.
00:04:35.025,00:04:39.863,"When Glee Club starts bringing that kind of prestige to the school again, you can have all the money you want."
00:04:39.947,00:04:41.615,"Until then, 60 bucks a month."
00:04:41.698,00:04:44.785,And you've got to use the costumes and props you already have.
00:04:44.868,00:04:46.286,But we need the stools for wood shop.
00:04:49.581,00:04:53.126,WILL: Hiding the $60 a month from my wife Terri was going to be hard.
00:04:53.210,00:04:54.795,But I had a bigger problem.
00:04:54.878,00:04:57.923,How was I going to get these kids motivated?
00:04:58.006,00:05:00.759,"One thing I knew for sure, we needed a new name."
00:05:00.843,00:05:03.846,New Directions!
00:05:06.723,00:05:09.351,My name is Mercedes Jones and I'm singing...
00:05:21.780,00:05:25.242,"Hello, I'm Kurt Hummel, and I'll be singing Mr. Cellophane."
00:05:57.900,00:06:00.319,I Kissed A Girl.
00:06:19.505,00:06:24.635,"Hi, my name is Rachel Berry, and I'll be singing On My Own from the seminal Broadway classic Les Miz."
00:06:24.718,00:06:27.221,"Fantastic, let's hear it."
00:06:34.895,00:06:39.107,"RACHEL: You might laugh because every time I sign my name, I put a gold star after it."
00:06:39.191,00:06:41.735,But it's a metaphor. And metaphors are important.
00:06:41.818,00:06:45.322,My gold stars are a metaphor for me being a star.
00:06:51.453,00:07:00.462,"And just so we're clear, I want to clear up that hateful rumor that I was the one who turned that closet case Sandy Ryerson in because he gave Hank Saunders the solo I deserved."
00:07:00.546,00:07:01.797,That's cockpoopie.
00:07:01.880,00:07:03.632,He was touching Hank! Caressing him.
00:07:03.715,00:07:05.884,It was so wrong!
00:07:13.058,00:07:14.726,I am not homophobic.
00:07:14.810,00:07:16.687,"In fact, I have two gay dads."
00:07:16.770,00:07:18.605,"See, I was born out of love."
00:07:18.689,00:07:21.984,My two dads screened potential surrogates based on beauty and IQ.
00:07:22.067,00:07:25.487,Then they mixed their sperm together and used a turkey baster.
00:07:25.571,00:07:29.366,"To this day, we don't know which one is my real dad, which I think is pretty amazing."
00:07:29.449,00:07:31.368,My dads spoiled me in the arts.
00:07:31.451,00:07:33.579,"I was given dance lessons, vocal lessons."
00:07:33.662,00:07:35.956,Anything to give me a competitive edge.
00:07:40.878,00:07:47.342,"You might think that all the boys in school would totally want to tap this, but my MySpace schedule keeps me way too busy to date."
00:07:47.426,00:07:51.388,"I try to post a MySpace video every day, just to keep my talent alive and growing."
00:07:53.307,00:07:56.560,"Nowadays, being anonymous is worse than being poor."
00:07:56.643,00:07:59.104,Fame is the most important thing in our culture now.
00:07:59.188,00:08:03.025,"And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that no one's just gonna hand it to you."
00:09:03.252,00:09:05.128,"Very nice, Rachel."
00:09:05.212,00:09:07.464,When do we start rehearsals?
00:09:40.122,00:09:41.331,We suck.
00:09:41.415,00:09:43.917,"Uh, it-- It'll get there."
00:09:44.001,00:09:45.335,We-we just need to keep rehearsing.
00:09:45.419,00:09:51.717,"Mr. Schuester, do you have any idea how ridiculous it is to give the lead solo in Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat to a boy in a wheelchair?"
00:09:51.800,00:09:54.636,I think Mr. Schue is using irony to enhance the performance.
00:09:54.720,00:09:57.598,There is nothing ironic about show choir!
00:10:06.190,00:10:08.483,That's sloppy!
00:10:08.567,00:10:10.319,You're sloppy babies!
00:10:10.402,00:10:12.279,It's just disgraceful!
00:10:12.362,00:10:14.281,And I want the agony out of your eyes!
00:10:14.364,00:10:17.201,"Uh-uh, Lance, don't you start crying!"
00:10:17.284,00:10:19.286,"You are the weak link, pal!"
00:10:19.369,00:10:21.705,"How does it feel to be the weak link, huh?!"
00:10:21.788,00:10:23.123,That can't feel very good!
00:10:23.207,00:10:24.750,You changed out of your costume.
00:10:24.833,00:10:26.418,I'm tired of being laughed at.
00:10:29.379,00:10:31.173,"You're the best kid in there, Rachel."
00:10:31.256,00:10:32.883,That comes with a price.
00:10:32.966,00:10:38.555,"Look, I know I'm just a sophomore, but I can feel the clock ticking away, and I don't want to leave high school with nothing to show for it."
00:10:38.639,00:10:39.681,You get great grades.
00:10:39.765,00:10:40.933,You're a fantastic singer.
00:10:41.016,00:10:42.726,Everybody hates me.
00:10:42.809,00:10:44.770,You think Glee Club is going to change that?
00:10:44.853,00:10:46.980,Being great at something is going to change it.
00:10:47.064,00:10:51.568,"Being a part of something special makes you special, right?"
00:10:51.652,00:10:53.904,I need a male lead who can keep up with me vocally.
00:10:53.987,00:11:00.160,"-Maybe I can coach Artie a little. -Look, Mr. Schue, I really appreciate what you're trying to do, but if you can't give me what I need, then I'm sorry."
00:11:00.244,00:11:02.162,I'm not going to make a fool out of myself.
00:11:03.747,00:11:06.291,I can't keep wasting my time with Glee.
00:11:06.375,00:11:08.669,It hurts too much.
00:11:09.753,00:11:11.129,Schuester!
00:11:11.213,00:11:12.923,Figgins wants ya!
00:11:16.969,00:11:18.887,But we just started rehearsals.
00:11:18.971,00:11:20.514,"My hands are tied, Schue."
00:11:20.597,00:11:22.140,I need the auditorium.
00:11:22.224,00:11:25.352,Alcoholics Anonymous wants to rent it out for their afternoon meetings.
00:11:25.435,00:11:26.854,Lots of drunks in this town.
00:11:26.937,00:11:28.313,They're paying me 10 bucks a head.
00:11:28.397,00:11:30.691,"If we show at Regionals, Glee stays."
00:11:30.774,00:11:32.401,"If not, the bar's open in the auditorium."
00:11:32.484,00:11:33.694,What is it with you and this club?
00:11:33.777,00:11:36.488,You've got only five kids-- one of them's a cripple.
00:11:36.572,00:11:38.657,"Then, I guess you've got nothing to worry about."
00:11:41.702,00:11:42.619,Fine.
00:11:42.703,00:11:44.830,Yes.
00:11:44.913,00:11:47.499,But you're running detention for free to make it up to me.
00:11:49.501,00:11:51.712,Deal.
00:11:55.757,00:11:57.467,You put your hands in the corners like this.
00:11:57.551,00:11:58.552,Okay?
00:11:58.635,00:11:59.970,I can't do it.
00:12:00.053,00:12:01.638,I'm dyslexic.
00:12:01.722,00:12:04.808,Maybe I should just stick to towels and washcloths.
00:12:04.892,00:12:07.936,"Howard, if you can't fold a fitted sheet, you cannot work at Sheets 'N Things."
00:12:10.439,00:12:11.732,Go.
00:12:11.815,00:12:13.734,Make sure they have a receipt.
00:12:15.068,00:12:16.236,Someone looks beautiful today.
00:12:16.320,00:12:17.988,-Hey. -Hi.
00:12:18.071,00:12:19.031,You look very handsome.
00:12:19.114,00:12:21.241,Thank you.
00:12:21.325,00:12:23.327,Roast beef on pumpernickel-- -your favorite. -Aw.
00:12:23.410,00:12:25.662,"-Oh, does it have mayo? -Yeah."
00:12:25.746,00:12:28.624,"Will, if my diabetes comes back, I can't get pregnant."
00:12:28.707,00:12:30.876,-I-- -What is wrong with you?
00:12:32.628,00:12:35.797,that I'm going to have to start working late for the next couple months.
00:12:35.881,00:12:37.674,"I'm, uh, monitoring after-school detention."
00:12:37.758,00:12:38.967,What?
00:12:39.051,00:12:41.970,I had to make a deal with Figgins so he wouldn't kill Glee Club.
00:12:42.054,00:12:44.973,"But, Will, I'm on my feet four hours a day three times a week here."
00:12:45.057,00:12:47.559,"Now I have to go home, and I have to cook dinner for myself?"
00:12:48.727,00:12:51.688,"This lady wants to return these sheets, but..."
00:12:51.772,00:12:53.941,something tells me we've got another bedwetter.
00:12:55.359,00:12:57.694,Do you see what I have to deal with here?
00:12:57.778,00:12:59.071,Hmm?
00:12:59.154,00:13:01.657,"God, hasn't she ever heard of a diaper?"
00:13:01.740,00:13:05.327,"SANDY: Of course, towels have a thread count, Mister..."
00:13:05.410,00:13:07.579,Sheets 'N Things.
00:13:07.663,00:13:09.414,What do you do? I read catalogues.
00:13:09.498,00:13:10.707,I know these things.
00:13:10.791,00:13:14.545,"Anything under a 400-thread count, and I could break out in impetigo."
00:13:14.628,00:13:15.587,It's simple to understand.
00:13:15.671,00:13:16.755,William?
00:13:17.923,00:13:20.050,Sandy? Hey.
00:13:20.133,00:13:22.761,"Well, hello. How are things?"
00:13:22.845,00:13:25.597,I hear you have taken over Glee Club.
00:13:25.681,00:13:26.765,Yeah.
00:13:26.849,00:13:28.392,I... hope you're not too upset.
00:13:28.475,00:13:29.935,Are you kidding?
00:13:30.018,00:13:33.063,Getting out of that swirling eddy of despair-- best thing that ever happened to me.
00:13:34.982,00:13:35.899,Don't get me wrong.
00:13:35.983,00:13:37.985,It wasn't easy at first.
00:13:38.068,00:13:40.612,"Being dismissed, and for what I was accused of?"
00:13:40.696,00:13:44.700,My long-distance girlfriend in Cleveland nearly broke up with me.
00:13:44.783,00:13:47.286,"Oh, God, don't you love a good monkey?"
00:13:47.369,00:13:49.997,Took me weeks to get over my nervous breakdown.
00:13:50.080,00:13:51.790,Did they put you on medication?
00:13:51.874,00:13:54.626,Better: medical marijuana.
00:13:54.710,00:13:55.878,It's genius.
00:13:55.961,00:14:01.300,"I just tell my Dr. Feelgood I'm having trouble sleeping, and he gives me all of it I want."
00:14:01.383,00:14:03.302,I'm finding the whole system quite lucrative.
00:14:03.385,00:14:05.053,You're a drug dealer?
00:14:05.137,00:14:07.598,"Oh, yeah. Make five times more than when I was a teacher."
00:14:07.681,00:14:11.935,"I keep some for myself, and then I take money baths in the rest."
00:14:12.019,00:14:13.729,Who-who do you sell it to?
00:14:18.525,00:14:19.568,You want in?
00:14:21.403,00:14:26.158,"Uh, no-- I mean, I tried it once in college, but Terri and I are trying to get pregnant, so..."
00:14:26.241,00:14:27.201,"-I do my own packaging-- -Sandy, no."
00:14:27.284,00:14:28.452,And the first sample is free.
00:14:28.535,00:14:31.788,"Come on, you are the one who are coaching those tone-deaf acne factories."
00:14:31.872,00:14:33.665,You're going to need it-- What?
00:14:33.749,00:14:35.501,This looks like barf.
00:14:35.584,00:14:36.668,Okay?
00:14:36.752,00:14:37.878,I have to do everything myself.
00:14:37.961,00:14:39.880,Call me. Come on.
00:14:39.963,00:14:42.090,What's the matter with you?
00:14:42.174,00:14:43.717,Scary.
00:14:45.177,00:14:47.304,"Hey, Sue. Can I have a sec?"
00:14:49.389,00:14:51.099,"Sure, buddy. Come on in."
00:14:56.813,00:14:58.190,Ooh.
00:14:59.775,00:15:01.652,"Hey, Emma, you got a second?"
00:15:02.945,00:15:04.863,"-What is that, gum? -Uh-huh."
00:15:04.947,00:15:07.658,"So, you want to talk to my Cheerios about joining Glee Club?"
00:15:07.741,00:15:13.497,"Well, I need more kids-- performers-- and all the best ones are in the Cheerios, so I figured some of them might want to double up."
00:15:13.580,00:15:17.167,"Okay, so what you're doing right now is called blurring the lines."
00:15:17.251,00:15:19.211,High school is a caste system.
00:15:19.294,00:15:20.712,Kids fall into certain slots.
00:15:20.796,00:15:23.382,Your jocks and your popular kids...
00:15:23.465,00:15:24.550,up in the penthouse.
00:15:24.633,00:15:30.806,The invisibles and the kids playing live-action druids and trolls out in the forest: bottom floor.
00:15:30.889,00:15:33.642,And... where do the Glee kids lie?
00:15:33.725,00:15:35.853,Sub-basement.
00:15:35.936,00:15:39.022,"Sue's not wrong, but I don't think anything is set in stone."
00:15:39.106,00:15:43.068,"I mean, you know, kids are gonna do what they think is cool, which is not always who they are."
00:15:43.151,00:15:45.571,You just need to find a way to get them out of their boxes.
00:15:45.654,00:15:47.906,"-Well, how do I do that? -They follow the leader."
00:15:47.990,00:15:51.493,"You know, if you can get a couple popular kids to sign up, the rest will fall right in line."
00:15:51.577,00:15:53.120,I just want to talk to them.
00:15:53.203,00:15:54.288,"I don't know, dude."
00:15:54.371,00:15:56.957,I can't see any of my guys wanting to join the glee club.
00:15:57.040,00:16:01.503,"Last month, they held down one of their teammates, shaved off his eyebrows just because he watched Grey's Anatomy."
00:16:01.587,00:16:03.797,"Look, all I'm looking for is an introduction."
00:16:03.881,00:16:05.257,Fine.
00:16:05.340,00:16:08.510,You got to put a good word in for me with Emma.
00:16:09.845,00:16:11.430,"There you go, Cinderella."
00:16:11.513,00:16:13.056,Thank you.
00:16:13.140,00:16:16.560,"I have trouble with things like that-- the, um..."
00:16:16.643,00:16:18.228,the-- the messy things.
00:16:18.312,00:16:19.730,Yeah.
00:16:19.813,00:16:28.280,"It's really nice how much you care about Glee, If you really care about these kids, you'll leave well enough alone."
00:16:28.363,00:16:36.997,"Children like to know where they stand, so let your little Glee kids have their little club, but don't pretend that any of them are something they're not."
00:16:45.881,00:16:47.174,Now Mr. Schuester is going to talk to you.
00:16:47.257,00:16:49.718,"If you don't listen, you do laps."
00:16:49.801,00:16:52.638,"You mouth off, you do laps."
00:16:52.721,00:16:54.014,Got it?
00:16:54.097,00:16:55.224,"They're all yours, Will."
00:16:55.307,00:16:57.017,"Thanks, Ken. Hey, guys, how you doing?"
00:16:57.100,00:17:04.650,"Uh, I think I recognize some of you from Spanish class, but, uh, I'm-- I'm here today to talk to you about something different: uh, music."
00:17:08.654,00:17:10.697,Glee Club needs guys.
00:17:10.781,00:17:12.908,I can sing.
00:17:12.991,00:17:15.077,Really? That's fantastic.
00:17:15.160,00:17:16.328,You want to hear?
00:17:28.632,00:17:31.218,"Oh, yeah!"
00:17:36.765,00:17:41.520,"I'm going to put the sign-up sheet at the door to the locker room, so if anyone wants to sign up, please... Thank you."
00:17:43.146,00:17:44.982,"Puck, in my office in five minutes."
00:17:47.818,00:17:49.027,You been sleeping okay?
00:17:49.111,00:17:51.154,Your eyes look a little bloodshot.
00:17:51.238,00:17:53.657,I got allergies.
00:17:53.740,00:17:55.659,Okay. Thanks a lot.
00:18:02.457,00:18:07.504,WILL: I honestly thought that was the end of the very brief fever dream that was New Directions!
00:18:30.652,00:18:34.448,I suddenly realized why I had wanted to do this thing in the first place.
00:18:36.325,00:18:39.536,It was seeing the gift in a kid that they didn't even know they had.
00:18:43.290,00:18:44.958,It was pure talent.
00:18:55.135,00:18:56.678,What I did then...
00:18:56.762,00:18:59.598,was the blackest moment of my life.
00:19:03.018,00:19:04.603,You want to tell me how long you've had a drug problem?
00:19:04.686,00:19:06.688,I don't even know who the Chronic Lady is.
00:19:06.772,00:19:10.442,"Look, if it were up to me, we wouldn't have mandatory biweekly afternoon locker checks."
00:19:10.526,00:19:12.194,"But I've never seen that before, Mr. Shue, I swear."
00:19:12.277,00:19:13.612,It's not mine-- I'll pee in a cup.
00:19:15.030,00:19:19.034,"-I'll pee. -Look, it-- it wouldn't make any difference."
00:19:19.117,00:19:20.577,Possession is eight-tenths of the law.
00:19:20.661,00:19:24.623,I'm pretty sure that much pot is a felony. Yeah.
00:19:24.706,00:19:26.708,"Look, you'll get kicked out of school."
00:19:26.792,00:19:28.335,You'll lose your football scholarship.
00:19:28.418,00:19:30.254,"Wait, I-- I had a football scholarship?"
00:19:30.337,00:19:31.380,To-- To where?
00:19:31.463,00:19:32.881,"You could land in prison, son."
00:19:32.965,00:19:34.091,"Oh, my God."
00:19:34.174,00:19:35.801,"Please, don't tell my mom."
00:19:37.970,00:19:40.264,"Look, I see a lot of myself in you, Finn."
00:19:41.598,00:19:49.314,"I know what it's like to struggle to make good life choices, and I don't want to see you throw away everything you have to offer the world."
00:19:52.025,00:19:54.444,"I just expected more out of you, Finn."
00:19:54.528,00:20:00.909,"FINN: That really got to me when Mr. Schuester said that, because every day of my life, I expect more out of myself."
00:20:00.993,00:20:07.791,"See, I might look confident and everything, but I really struggle with the same thing others kids do: peer pressure, bacne."
00:20:09.543,00:20:11.003,I never knew my dad.
00:20:11.086,00:20:14.965,He died in Iraq when we were fighting Osama bin Laden the first time.
00:20:16.633,00:20:19.052,"Hold on, hold on. Finn, Finn, Finn!"
00:20:19.136,00:20:20.470,"Please, I'm on the phone."
00:20:20.554,00:20:25.517,"I just want to trade next Saturday's shift for this Saturday, because Finn's got a parents night for Cub Scouts."
00:20:25.601,00:20:30.439,"FINN: My mom and me, we're real close, but being a single parent can be hard."
00:20:30.522,00:20:35.652,The only good time for Mom was when we splurged a little bit and ordered Emerald Dreams.
00:20:35.736,00:20:39.907,"Darren was good to her, and he was cool about letting me hang out."
00:20:51.919,00:20:54.796,FINN: That was the first time I really heard music.
00:21:02.679,00:21:04.723,"FINN: Man, it set my soul on fire."
00:21:07.184,00:21:08.519,"You got a voice, buddy."
00:21:09.978,00:21:15.359,"Seriously, if I had that voice, my band would still be together."
00:21:15.442,00:21:17.402,Stick with it.
00:21:17.486,00:21:22.366,FINN: My mom took it real hard when Darren left her for that girl he met at Pick &amp; Save.
00:21:40.884,00:21:48.934,"FINN: It was at that moment I decided to do whatever it took to make my mom proud of me, make her feel all her sacrifice was worth it."
00:21:49.017,00:21:50.853,We have two options here.
00:21:50.936,00:21:57.568,"I'm running detention now, so you can do six weeks after school, but that's gonna remain on your permanent record."
00:21:57.651,00:21:59.987,"What's the other option, Mr. Shue?"
00:22:44.865,00:22:46.783,"Oh, hell to the no."
00:22:46.867,00:22:49.661,"Look, I'm not down with this background singing nonsense."
00:22:49.745,00:22:51.872,I'm Beyonce. I ain't no Kelly Rowland.
00:22:51.955,00:22:54.458,"Okay, look, Mercedes, it's just one song."
00:22:54.541,00:22:56.877,And it's the first time we've been kind of good.
00:22:56.960,00:22:59.963,"Okay, you're good, white boy."
00:23:00.047,00:23:01.423,I'll give you that.
00:23:01.507,00:23:03.634,But you better bring it.
00:23:03.717,00:23:04.927,Let's run it again.
00:23:05.010,00:23:06.094,"All right, let's do it."
00:23:06.178,00:23:07.346,From the top.
00:23:10.390,00:23:12.643,You usually don't let me in your craft room.
00:23:12.726,00:23:15.479,Isn't this fun? And challenging.
00:23:15.562,00:23:17.481,"Every Wednesday, we're gonna have puzzle night."
00:23:17.564,00:23:20.859,Because I know how important it is for you to have a creative outlet.
00:23:24.863,00:23:26.490,"You know, the kids have been working so hard."
00:23:26.573,00:23:28.784,I was thinking about taking them on a field trip next Saturday.
00:23:28.867,00:23:30.744,Carmel High's performing a showcase down in Akron.
00:23:30.827,00:23:33.372,"Now, Carmel's gonna be the team to beat at regionals."
00:23:33.455,00:23:37.668,And I was wondering if you might want to come chaperone it with me.
00:23:37.751,00:23:38.919,On Saturday?
00:23:39.002,00:23:41.463,"-Oh, I can't. -Oh."
00:23:41.547,00:23:43.549,"I had to pick up an extra shift at work, Will."
00:23:43.632,00:23:44.883,"We're living paycheck to paycheck, you know."
00:23:44.967,00:23:47.928,And how much of that paycheck goes to your Pottery Barn credit card?
00:23:48.011,00:23:49.888,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:23:52.307,00:23:54.101,Don't go in the Christmas closet!
00:23:54.184,00:23:56.395,I was looking for my jacket the other day.
00:23:56.478,00:23:58.647,"We cannot afford this stuff, Terri."
00:23:58.730,00:24:00.357,"But we could, Will."
00:24:00.440,00:24:04.152,"Yes, I am a shoo-in to be promoted during the Christmas week at Sheets 'N Things."
00:24:04.236,00:24:07.948,"You know, I reek of management potential, and they're hiring at H.W. Menken."
00:24:08.031,00:24:09.825,"My passion is teaching, Terri."
00:24:09.908,00:24:11.869,"For the last time, I don't want to be an accountant."
00:24:11.952,00:24:13.453,Dr. Phil said that people could change.
00:24:13.537,00:24:19.585,"You know, it's not a bad thing to want a real life, Will, and to have a glue gun that works!"
00:24:22.129,00:24:26.008,"You know, it's really hard for me not having the things that I need."
00:24:26.091,00:24:29.678,Oh! And you need three mahogany toilet brush holders?!
00:24:29.761,00:24:31.763,They're Balinese!
00:24:31.847,00:24:36.226,"It is not a bad thing to want things, Will."
00:24:36.310,00:24:40.105,"You know, I understand your interest in these kids, Will."
00:24:40.189,00:24:41.607,I really do.
00:24:41.690,00:24:43.150,Yeah.
00:24:43.233,00:24:45.903,It's your way of recapturing your glory days.
00:24:45.986,00:24:50.199,"But I'm not the high school cheerleader anymore, and you are not the golden boy."
00:24:50.282,00:24:52.951,High school's over... for both of us.
00:24:54.661,00:24:56.455,It's time that you move on.
00:25:45.546,00:25:47.089,KEN: You're the quarterback.
00:25:47.172,00:25:48.340,-Coach-- -No. I don't want to hear it.
00:25:48.423,00:25:50.050,You make your decision.
00:25:50.133,00:25:52.344,"You're a football player, or you're a singer."
00:25:55.097,00:25:56.932,Hey. What's going on?
00:25:57.015,00:26:00.269,Oh. I just-- I have to miss practice Saturday afternoon.
00:26:00.352,00:26:01.770,"It's, uh-- it's my mom."
00:26:01.854,00:26:04.648,"I got to help her... cook and, uh, do things."
00:26:04.731,00:26:06.191,Why?
00:26:06.275,00:26:08.360,"She just had, uh, surgery."
00:26:08.443,00:26:10.487,What kind of surgery?
00:26:10.571,00:26:14.324,"Uh, well, she, um, had to have her prostate out."
00:26:14.408,00:26:16.159,"Man, that's a tough break."
00:26:16.243,00:26:19.746,"Yeah, it's, uh, engorged."
00:26:19.830,00:26:21.331,You think this is hard?
00:26:21.415,00:26:22.457,I'm living with hepatitis. That's hard.
00:26:24.960,00:26:27.796,You stole my quarterback.
00:26:27.880,00:26:29.673,"Okay, look."
00:26:29.756,00:26:31.216,Finn's got a great voice.
00:26:31.300,00:26:32.676,He-- He just wants to express himself.
00:26:32.759,00:26:34.219,You're screwing up my life.
00:26:34.303,00:26:36.471,"Okay, Ken, you hate football."
00:26:36.555,00:26:38.640,What's this really about?
00:26:40.601,00:26:42.394,"Hey, Eminem."
00:26:42.477,00:26:46.273,"So, I got tickets to monster trucks this weekend."
00:26:46.356,00:26:47.524,Loge tickets.
00:26:47.608,00:26:49.067,"No, thanks, not my thing."
00:26:49.151,00:26:52.571,"Truckzilla versus Truckasaurus, and get this: the trucks breathe fire."
00:26:52.654,00:26:56.283,"Ken, look, you know every time you ask me out, I tell you that I'm on my period?"
00:26:56.366,00:26:57.868,Which doesn't bother me.
00:26:57.951,00:27:01.747,"Or I tell you I'm suffering from cluster headaches, or I'm allergic to nighttime?"
00:27:01.830,00:27:04.374,"The thing is, not really true."
00:27:04.458,00:27:06.502,-I'm just not interested in dating you. -Shh...
00:27:08.420,00:27:09.838,How do I get you...
00:27:09.922,00:27:11.298,into my hatchback?
00:27:11.381,00:27:12.925,"Okay, Ken, fine, you know what? Make me say it."
00:27:13.008,00:27:15.427,I like somebody else. All right?
00:27:15.511,00:27:20.349,"Nothing you can do about it because they're unavailable so I have to deal with that, but..."
00:27:24.478,00:27:27.314,You're right. I'm overreacting.
00:27:27.397,00:27:28.482,The herd will take care of it.
00:27:28.565,00:27:30.567,-The herd? -The student body.
00:27:30.651,00:27:35.072,"The second one tries to rise above, be different, the herd pulls 'em back in."
00:27:35.155,00:27:36.114,So...
00:27:36.198,00:27:38.492,Oh! And by the way.
00:27:38.575,00:27:40.827,"Thanks for putting a good word in for me with Emma, buddy."
00:27:40.911,00:27:43.038,"I guess you just want her for yourself, huh?"
00:27:45.207,00:27:46.542,"Adios, amigo."
00:27:52.923,00:27:54.675,You're very talented.
00:27:54.758,00:27:58.095,-Really? -Yeah.
00:27:58.178,00:28:01.598,"I would know. I'm very talented, too."
00:28:01.682,00:28:04.977,I think the rest of the team expects us to become an item.
00:28:05.060,00:28:10.107,"You, the hot male lead, and me, the stunning young ingenue everyone roots for."
00:28:10.190,00:28:13.277,"Well, I, uh, have a girlfriend."
00:28:13.360,00:28:15.028,Really?
00:28:15.112,00:28:16.530,Who?
00:28:16.613,00:28:17.990,Quinn Fabray.
00:28:18.073,00:28:19.658,Cheerleader Quinn Fabray?
00:28:19.741,00:28:21.827,The president of the Celibacy Club?
00:28:31.670,00:28:34.214,Wait.
00:28:36.842,00:28:39.136,Let's pray.
00:28:41.847,00:28:43.765,We're almost four months now.
00:28:43.849,00:28:45.309,She's cool.
00:28:45.392,00:28:47.811,"Mmm, I wonder if they have Sour Patch Kids."
00:28:50.105,00:28:52.524,Those kielbasas look like they've been in there a while.
00:28:52.608,00:28:55.485,Do you want to go halvsies on a PB and J?
00:28:55.569,00:28:57.070,That sounds perfect.
00:28:57.154,00:28:58.906,-Yeah? -Yeah. Let's go.
00:28:58.989,00:29:01.366,Sorry. Excuse me.
00:29:01.450,00:29:04.995,I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in a really long time.
00:29:05.078,00:29:06.496,Really?
00:29:06.580,00:29:08.040,Yeah. My wife's allergic to nuts.
00:29:09.750,00:29:12.377,"Well, that's really sweet, though-- not eating something because she can't."
00:29:12.461,00:29:13.837,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:15.172,00:29:16.507,"Oh, that's really noisy."
00:29:16.590,00:29:17.549,But they're clean.
00:29:18.800,00:29:20.469,"-Oh, my gosh. -There you go."
00:29:20.552,00:29:21.845,"-How, um... -Mmm."
00:29:21.929,00:29:23.889,How long have you two been married?
00:29:23.972,00:29:25.140,"Mm, five years last March."
00:29:25.224,00:29:26.725,-Really? -Yeah.
00:29:26.808,00:29:28.560,But we've been together since high school.
00:29:28.644,00:29:30.812,"I mean, she was my first girlfriend, actually."
00:29:30.896,00:29:32.564,Was it love at first sight?
00:29:32.648,00:29:34.399,For me it was.
00:29:34.483,00:29:35.651,I don't know.
00:29:35.734,00:29:38.028,She used to be filled with so much joy.
00:29:38.111,00:29:40.072,And now?
00:29:42.115,00:29:43.617,Oh. Showtime.
00:29:43.700,00:29:45.869,"Oh, you don't want to hear about my marital problems."
00:29:45.953,00:29:47.412,"Oh, no, I do. I-I do."
00:29:47.496,00:29:54.086,"I mean, I-I'd love to hear. You-- I mean, I'm not happy that you have marital problems, but people talk to me a lot 'cause I'm a guidance counselor."
00:29:54.169,00:29:55.671,"-Okay, here's the thing. -Mm-hmm?"
00:29:55.754,00:29:57.965,"Terri rides me hard, and I've always appreciated it."
00:29:58.048,00:30:01.051,"I figure she just wants me to be better, you know?"
00:30:01.134,00:30:03.554,"But lately, though, I keep asking myself, better at what?"
00:30:03.637,00:30:05.055,-Making money? Being upwardly mobile? -Mm-hmm.
00:30:05.138,00:30:07.641,Thank you. I don't know.
00:30:07.724,00:30:09.017,I-I love her. Don't get me wrong.
00:30:09.101,00:30:11.645,We just got to get back on the same page.
00:30:11.728,00:30:13.438,Do you like the sandwich?
00:30:13.522,00:30:15.232,"Oh, my God, it's like the best I've ever had."
00:30:15.315,00:30:20.737,"Hey, guys, so this is supposed to be our competition, but, uh, I honestly don't think that they've got the talent that we've got."
00:30:20.821,00:30:22.489,"But let's be a good audience, all right?"
00:30:22.573,00:30:24.324,Give 'em some of that old McKinley High respect.
00:30:24.408,00:30:31.248,"MALE ANNOUNCER: Please give a warm Buckeye State welcome to last year's regional champion, Vocal Adrenaline!"
00:32:18.689,00:32:20.774,We're d-d-doomed.
00:32:39.126,00:32:42.421,Chicks don't have prostates.
00:32:42.504,00:32:43.714,I looked it up.
00:32:43.797,00:32:47.259,"You broke the rules, Finn, and for that, you must be punished."
00:32:49.344,00:32:50.929,Wait. Wait. Wait.
00:32:51.013,00:32:53.140,"Wait. You've got the power here, okay?"
00:32:53.223,00:32:55.017,You-you don't have to do this.
00:33:05.736,00:33:07.863,There's my baby.
00:33:07.946,00:33:10.073,"Wow, honey."
00:33:10.157,00:33:12.534,This is amazing.
00:33:12.618,00:33:14.703,What-what's the congratulations for?
00:33:14.786,00:33:16.038,The-The kids haven't won anything yet.
00:33:18.332,00:33:20.209,I'm pregnant.
00:33:22.669,00:33:24.630,Really?
00:33:24.713,00:33:26.048,Yeah.
00:33:26.131,00:33:27.591,"Terri, don't mess with me."
00:33:27.674,00:33:29.384,"Oh, my God, this is amazing."
00:33:29.468,00:33:31.553,We're going to be a family.
00:33:37.559,00:33:40.062,Oh! Can't believe it.
00:33:46.485,00:33:47.486,You're leaving us?
00:33:47.569,00:33:49.321,When?
00:33:49.404,00:33:54.868,"Well, I've given my two weeks' notice, but I promise I'm gonna find you guys a great replacement before I go."
00:33:54.952,00:33:56.703,Is this 'cause those Carmel kids were so good?
00:33:56.787,00:33:57.871,Because we can work harder.
00:33:57.955,00:34:00.541,"This isn't fair, Mr. Schuester."
00:34:00.624,00:34:02.668,We can't do this without you.
00:34:02.751,00:34:07.422,So does that mean that I don't have to be in the club anymore or...?
00:34:07.506,00:34:10.717,This isn't about you guys.
00:34:10.801,00:34:13.303,Being an adult is about having to make difficult choices.
00:34:14.721,00:34:16.390,It's not like high school.
00:34:16.473,00:34:18.517,Sometimes you have to...
00:34:18.600,00:34:21.478,give up the things that you love.
00:34:21.562,00:34:24.273,One day you guys are going to grow up and understand that.
00:34:26.066,00:34:30.195,I have loved being your teacher.
00:36:41.702,00:36:43.954,That's why he gave Figgins his notice.
00:36:44.037,00:36:45.205,Really?
00:37:10.314,00:37:13.150,Need help grading those papers?
00:37:13.233,00:37:15.819,It's actually an application for H.W. Menken.
00:37:15.903,00:37:16.820,They're hiring.
00:37:18.363,00:37:19.531,Come on.
00:37:19.615,00:37:21.074,Accounting is sexy.
00:37:26.038,00:37:28.040,I'll miss you.
00:37:28.123,00:37:29.249,"Before you leave, can you do me a favor?"
00:37:29.333,00:37:30.626,Yeah.
00:37:30.709,00:37:34.171,I made an appointment for you tomorrow in the career center.
00:37:35.339,00:37:36.798,You need some guidance.
00:37:36.882,00:37:38.842,"I'm having a kid, Emma."
00:37:38.926,00:37:40.886,What I need is better benefits.
00:37:40.969,00:37:43.388,"Just come, Will, for me."
00:37:50.854,00:37:52.272,Didn't see you at Glee Club today.
00:37:52.356,00:37:54.316,Is that still happening?
00:37:54.399,00:37:55.943,-I've taken over. -Oh.
00:37:56.026,00:37:58.570,"I'm interim director, but I expect the position will become permanent."
00:37:58.654,00:38:00.781,"-Hi, Finn, RuPaul. -Hey."
00:38:00.864,00:38:02.199,What are you doing talking to her?
00:38:02.282,00:38:04.034,Oh...
00:38:04.117,00:38:06.078,Science project-- we're partners.
00:38:07.788,00:38:09.831,"Christ Crusaders tonight at 5:00, my house."
00:38:09.915,00:38:10.832,Sounds great.
00:38:14.044,00:38:16.129,"Look, I-I should go."
00:38:16.213,00:38:17.172,I can't do Glee anymore.
00:38:17.256,00:38:18.215,It conflicts with...
00:38:18.298,00:38:20.300,Your reputation?
00:38:20.384,00:38:23.262,"You've really got something, Finn, and you're throwing it away."
00:38:23.345,00:38:24.930,I-I'm going to be late.
00:38:25.013,00:38:27.724,"You can't keep worrying about what people think, Finn."
00:38:27.808,00:38:29.560,You're better than all of them.
00:38:35.399,00:38:38.735,"What do you want me to do, apologize?"
00:38:38.819,00:38:42.239,"That's not me, dude."
00:38:42.322,00:38:46.243,"Look, if I joined the flag team, you'd beat the crap out of me."
00:38:46.326,00:38:47.911,I just don't understand why you did it.
00:38:47.995,00:38:51.665,"Schuester told me he'd give me enough extra credit to pass Spanish if I joined the club, okay?"
00:38:51.748,00:38:53.417,I-- I didn't have a choice.
00:38:53.500,00:38:55.711,"If I failed another class, I'd be off the team."
00:38:55.794,00:38:58.338,"Look, it's over, okay? I quit."
00:38:58.422,00:38:59.548,Anything else?
00:38:59.631,00:39:01.300,"No, that's it."
00:39:01.383,00:39:04.386,And as a welcome back to the world of the normal...
00:39:04.469,00:39:05.762,I got you a present.
00:39:08.473,00:39:09.683,What's that noise?
00:39:11.852,00:39:13.395,"Help, help!"
00:39:13.478,00:39:15.898,-Help! -Is someone in there?
00:39:15.981,00:39:17.649,We got that wheelchair kid inside.
00:39:17.733,00:39:19.234,We're going to flip it.
00:39:20.986,00:39:22.779,He's already in a wheelchair.
00:39:22.863,00:39:24.364,"Come on, dude, we saved you the first roll."
00:39:29.161,00:39:31.121,Ugh!
00:39:31.205,00:39:33.582,Thank you. Thank you so much.
00:39:33.665,00:39:35.209,ARTY: Thank you.
00:39:35.292,00:39:38.295,"-Oh, my God, the smell. -What the hell, dude?"
00:39:38.378,00:39:39.963,I can't believe you're helping out this loser.
00:39:40.047,00:39:41.882,"Don't you get it, man?"
00:39:41.965,00:39:45.594,We're all losers-- everyone in this school.
00:39:45.677,00:39:48.388,"Hell, everyone in this town."
00:39:48.472,00:39:54.186,"Out of all the kids who graduate, maybe half will go to college, a-and two will leave the state to do it."
00:39:54.269,00:39:58.357,I'm not afraid of being called a loser 'cause I can accept that that's what I am.
00:39:59.775,00:40:05.113,But I am afraid of turning my back on something that actually made me happy for the first time in my sorry life.
00:40:05.197,00:40:06.448,So what?
00:40:06.532,00:40:08.283,Are you quitting to join Homo Explosion?
00:40:09.576,00:40:10.744,I'm doing both.
00:40:10.827,00:40:13.956,'Cause you can't win without me and neither can they.
00:40:46.947,00:40:48.824,"Look, you guys, these steps are not hard."
00:40:48.907,00:40:50.742,I've been doing them since preschool.
00:40:50.826,00:40:52.202,"I'm sorry, did I miss the election for queen?"
00:40:52.286,00:40:53.495,Because I didn't vote for you.
00:40:53.579,00:40:54.997,I know what I'm talking about.
00:40:55.080,00:40:57.666,I won my first dance competition when I was three months old.
00:40:57.749,00:40:59.418,This is a closed rehearsal.
00:40:59.501,00:41:03.338,"Look, I owe you guys an apology."
00:41:03.422,00:41:05.507,I never should have quit.
00:41:06.800,00:41:10.137,I don't want to be the guy that just drives around throwing eggs at people.
00:41:10.220,00:41:11.346,That was you?
00:41:11.430,00:41:13.182,You and your friends threw pee balloons at me.
00:41:13.265,00:41:14.099,I know.
00:41:14.183,00:41:15.517,You nailed all my lawn furniture to my roof.
00:41:15.601,00:41:18.478,"I wasn't actually there for that, but I'm really sorry."
00:41:18.562,00:41:22.024,"Look, that isn't who I am, and I'm tired of it."
00:41:22.107,00:41:25.027,"This is what I want to be doing, with you guys."
00:41:25.110,00:41:30.616,"I used to think that this was, like, the lamest thing on Earth, and maybe it is, but..."
00:41:30.699,00:41:35.662,we're all here for the same reason-- 'cause we want to be good at something.
00:41:37.456,00:41:40.042,"Arty, you play guitar, right?"
00:41:40.125,00:41:41.502,Think you could recruit the jazz band?
00:41:41.585,00:41:43.253,I do have pull there.
00:41:44.421,00:41:47.591,"Mercedes, we need new costumes, a-and they have to be cool."
00:41:47.674,00:41:51.053,"-Can you do that? -Damn, don't you see what I got on?"
00:41:51.136,00:41:54.890,"Rachel, you can do choreography."
00:41:54.973,00:41:59.520,"-Tina, what are you good at? -I-I-- We'll figure something out for you."
00:41:59.603,00:42:02.189,"And what are you bringing to the table, Justin Timberlake?"
00:42:03.398,00:42:05.734,I've got the music.
00:42:11.782,00:42:14.618,I want to show you something.
00:42:15.994,00:42:20.374,I did a little research...
00:42:20.457,00:42:25.128,and this is a tape I found in the library of the '93 team at nationals.
00:42:33.929,00:42:35.681,Do you know who that is?
00:42:37.724,00:42:39.142,"That's you, Will."
00:42:42.896,00:42:45.148,That's you happier than I've ever seen you.
00:42:45.232,00:42:49.820,That was the greatest moment of my life.
00:42:49.903,00:42:51.154,Why?
00:42:51.238,00:42:53.532,Because I loved what I was doing.
00:42:53.615,00:42:59.788,I knew before we were halfway through with that number that we were going to win.
00:43:03.166,00:43:06.712,"Being a part of that, in that moment..."
00:43:09.548,00:43:11.425,I knew who I was in the world.
00:43:20.434,00:43:26.231,And the only time I've felt-- I've felt that way since then was when Terri told me I was going to be a father.
00:43:29.818,00:43:34.406,"No. No, I need to provide for my family."
00:43:34.489,00:43:36.742,But provide what exactly?
00:43:36.825,00:43:46.376,"The understanding that money is the most important thing or the idea that the only life worth living is one that you're really passionate about, Will?"
00:47:08.036,00:47:09.621,"Good, guys."
00:47:09.705,00:47:10.956,It's a nine.
00:47:11.039,00:47:12.541,We need a ten.
00:47:12.624,00:47:14.251,"Rachel, you need to hit the ones and the fives."
00:47:14.334,00:47:17.129,"Finn, I think if we worked on it, you could hit a high B."
00:47:17.212,00:47:19.131,So does this mean you're staying?
00:47:19.214,00:47:23.969,It would kill me to see you win nationals without me.
00:47:25.512,00:47:27.181,From the top.
00:00:08.091,00:00:10.051,Mr. Schuester!
00:00:10.093,00:00:11.303,Yeah?
00:00:11.345,00:00:16.057,"And I got some sheet music, and I wanted to run some songs by you that feature me heavily on lead vocal."
00:00:16.099,00:00:17.643,But I already got one picked out.
00:00:17.685,00:00:19.060,Let me help you with that.
00:00:19.102,00:00:20.855,"Thanks, Finn."
00:00:20.896,00:00:22.481,You're so chivalrous.
00:00:22.523,00:00:24.525,"That's a good thing, right?"
00:00:24.566,00:00:26.318,"Hey, Mr. Shue."
00:00:26.360,00:00:27.277,"Oh, yeah?"
00:00:26.360,00:00:31.740,"So it goes, With the finger, huh?"
00:00:31.782,00:00:33.074,"Oh, thank you, thank you."
00:00:33.116,00:00:34.952,"Hey, don't be late for rehearsal this afternoon."
00:00:34.994,00:00:36.453,All right.
00:00:36.495,00:00:37.997,"Morning, Kurt."
00:00:38.038,00:00:39.999,"Buenos nachos, Mr. Shue."
00:00:40.040,00:00:41.333,Hey!
00:00:41.375,00:00:43.377,"Let's go, Titans!"
00:00:44.378,00:00:46.380,Come on.
00:00:47.756,00:00:49.842,One day you will all work for me.
00:00:58.141,00:00:59.267,"It was very, very nice."
00:00:59.309,00:01:01.520,All right?
00:01:03.188,00:01:04.982,"Oh, Will, oh."
00:01:05.024,00:01:06.483,Gosh. Hi.
00:01:06.525,00:01:07.818,Hi.
00:01:07.860,00:01:11.279,"Uh, I wanted to thank you so much for the advice you gave me the other day."
00:01:11.321,00:01:15.784,"I mean, teaching here and coaching Glee Club-- it's where I belong."
00:01:15.826,00:01:17.619,"I mean, it's what I do."
00:01:15.826,00:01:18.913,"You know, I give counsel and give guidance."
00:01:18.954,00:01:20.121,"Yeah, you are."
00:01:20.163,00:01:21.498,"So-- oh, look we match, periwinkle."
00:01:21.540,00:01:23.375,Yeah.
00:01:23.417,00:01:25.920,"Mrs. Sylvester wants to see you in her office, Mr. Shue."
00:01:25.961,00:01:27.128,She doesn't like to be kept waiting.
00:01:27.170,00:01:29.130,You got it.
00:01:34.177,00:01:36.137,"Hey, Sue, you want to see me?"
00:01:36.179,00:01:37.932,"Hey, buddy. Come on in."
00:01:39.182,00:01:41.142,I just blasted my hammies.
00:01:41.184,00:01:42.644,Oh.
00:01:42.686,00:01:43.353,Iron tablet?
00:01:43.395,00:01:44.646,Uh...
00:01:44.688,00:01:46.231,Keeps your strength up while you're menstruating.
00:01:46.273,00:01:48.149,I don't menstruate.
00:01:48.191,00:01:49.860,Yeah?
00:01:49.902,00:01:50.819,Neither do I.
00:01:50.861,00:01:57.785,"So I had a little chat with Principal Figgins, and he said that if you're group doesn't place at Regionals, he's cutting the program."
00:01:57.826,00:01:59.870,Ouch.
00:01:59.912,00:02:01.162,"You know, you don't have to worry about Glee Club."
00:02:01.204,00:02:02.205,We're going to be fine.
00:02:02.247,00:02:03.248,Really?
00:02:03.290,00:02:11.590,"'Cause I was at the local library, where I read Cheerleading Today aloud to blind geriatrics, and I came across this little page-turner."
00:02:11.632,00:02:14.175,Show Choir Rule Book.
00:02:14.217,00:02:18.055,"And it turns out, you need 12 kids to qualify for Regionals."
00:02:18.097,00:02:21.224,"Last time I looked, you only had five and a half."
00:02:21.266,00:02:23.184,Here. Cripple in the wheelchair.
00:02:23.226,00:02:36.197,I also took the liberty special ed classesme for you-- maybe you could find some recruits-- because I'm not sure there's anybody else who's going to want to swim over to your Island of Misfit Toys.
00:02:36.239,00:02:40.035,"Are you threatening me, Sue?"
00:02:40.077,00:02:41.202,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:02:41.244,00:02:45.206,Presenting you with an opportunity to compromise yourself?
00:02:45.248,00:02:47.459,You betcha.
00:02:47.501,00:02:50.796,Let's break it down.
00:02:50.838,00:02:52.213,You want to be creative.
00:02:52.255,00:02:53.632,You want to be in the spotlight.
00:02:53.674,00:02:56.217,"Face it, you want to be me."
00:02:56.259,00:03:05.310,"So, here's the deal: you do with your depressing little group of kids what I did with my wealthy, elderly mother: euthanize it."
00:03:05.352,00:03:07.146,It's time.
00:03:07.186,00:03:10.107,And then I'll be happy to offer you a job as my second assistant on Cheerios.
00:03:10.149,00:03:16.822,"You can fetch me Gatorade, launder my soiled delicates, it'll be very rewarding work for you."
00:03:16.864,00:03:19.116,"You know what, Sue?"
00:03:19.158,00:03:21.076,I politely decline your offer.
00:03:21.118,00:03:22.285,Glee Club is here to stay.
00:03:22.327,00:03:24.287,I believe in my kids.
00:03:24.329,00:03:27.248,I know you're used to being the cock of the walk around here...
00:03:27.290,00:03:29.043,Offensive.
00:03:29.084,00:03:31.252,...but it looks like your Cheerios are going to have some competition.
00:03:31.294,00:03:33.254,We're going to show at Regionals.
00:03:33.296,00:03:35.716,You have my word on that.
00:03:36.550,00:03:38.677,Have a good day.
00:03:44.725,00:03:48.687,QUINN: popular kids in this schoolst over the next couple of years.
00:03:48.729,00:03:53.984,"Prom king and queen, homecoming court royalty, I'm not giving up those shiny crowns just so you can express yourself."
00:03:54.026,00:03:59.364,"FINN: a deal out of this. too big Okay, let's compromise."
00:03:59.406,00:04:03.284,"If you quit the club, I'll let you touch my breast."
00:04:03.326,00:04:04.745,FINN: Under the shirt?
00:04:04.786,00:04:07.789,Over the bra.
00:04:07.831,00:04:09.750,"No, no."
00:04:09.791,00:04:11.292,I can't.
00:04:11.334,00:04:12.502,I want to do Glee.
00:04:11.334,00:04:14.088,I-- I'm really happy when I'm performing.
00:04:14.129,00:04:15.964,"People think you're gay now, Finn."
00:04:16.006,00:04:17.465,And you know what that makes me?
00:04:17.507,00:04:19.176,Your big gay beard.
00:04:19.218,00:04:21.511,"Look, I-I-I got to go to class, okay?"
00:04:21.553,00:04:22.763,Just relax.
00:04:22.804,00:04:24.765,Everything's going to work out.
00:04:25.807,00:04:28.810,Eavesdrop much?
00:04:30.854,00:04:32.898,"Time for some girl talk, man hands."
00:04:32.940,00:04:36.902,"You can dance with him, you can sing with him, but you will never have him."
00:04:36.944,00:04:38.486,I understand why you'd be threatened.
00:04:38.528,00:04:41.698,"Finn and I have made a connection, but I'm an honorable person."
00:04:41.740,00:04:43.700,I don't need to steal your man.
00:04:43.742,00:04:45.326,I have plenty of suitors of my own.
00:04:45.368,00:04:48.747,Every day Glee's status is going up and yours is going down...
00:04:48.789,00:04:49.790,deal with it.
00:04:52.751,00:04:54.419,Holla.
00:04:58.381,00:04:59.340,"Energy, guys."
00:04:59.382,00:05:00.425,It's disco.
00:05:03.595,00:05:05.346,Good with the hands.
00:05:06.974,00:05:08.642,Freak it out.
00:05:10.560,00:05:13.396,And up and out and down and-- good.
00:05:13.438,00:05:15.356,"Good, good, guys."
00:05:19.861,00:05:21.571,Whoa! Whoa!
00:05:21.613,00:05:23.364,Hell to the nah.
00:05:23.406,00:05:27.202,"First of all, you try to bust my face again, and I will cut you."
00:05:27.244,00:05:29.370,"And also, this song is terrible."
00:05:29.412,00:05:30.831,"Okay, no, no, it's not the song."
00:05:30.872,00:05:32.207,You guys just need to get into it.
00:05:32.249,00:05:33.374,"No, it's the song."
00:05:33.416,00:05:34.626,It's really gay.
00:05:33.416,00:05:35.418,"We need modern music, Mr. Shue."
00:05:35.460,00:05:36.962,"I'm sorry, guys."
00:05:37.004,00:05:39.214,We don't have time to discuss this.
00:05:39.256,00:05:41.300,We're doing the song this Friday at the pep assembly.
00:05:41.340,00:05:42.467,In f-front of the whole school?
00:05:42.509,00:05:44.261,Exactly!
00:05:44.303,00:05:45.262,They're gonna throw fruit at us.
00:05:45.304,00:05:46.847,And I just had a facial.
00:05:46.888,00:05:48.223,I'll press charges if that happens.
00:05:48.265,00:05:52.393,"Guys, I can't express to you how important this assembly is."
00:05:52.435,00:05:54.271,We need recruits.
00:05:54.313,00:05:55.314,There're six of you.
00:05:55.396,00:05:57.398,We need 12 to qualify for Regionals.
00:05:57.440,00:05:59.400,We have no choice or...
00:05:59.442,00:06:00.819,the club is over.
00:06:00.861,00:06:05.406,"I know you guys don't like this song, but we took Nationals back in '93 with Freak Out."
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.117,It's a crowd-pleaser.
00:06:07.159,00:06:08.409,Trust me.
00:06:08.451,00:06:09.410,From the top.
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.370,I'm dead.
00:06:20.255,00:06:23.424,WILL: My father always said you become a man when you buy your first house.
00:06:23.466,00:06:27.428,"I'm not sure what he meant by that, since he burned ours down once after a drunken fight with Mom."
00:06:27.470,00:06:30.098,Welcome to your little slice of the American dream.
00:06:30.140,00:06:33.101,I have a question about the trees.
00:06:33.143,00:06:37.147,It's always been my personal dream to cut down my own Christmas tree.
00:06:37.189,00:06:39.733,How many Christmas trees will we have in the backyard?
00:06:39.774,00:06:41.151,And do they come in different colors?
00:06:41.193,00:06:46.240,"Because, well-- obviously we're expecting a family, and I have a real sense that it might be a girl."
00:06:46.281,00:06:48.116,"WILL: Still, I can't believe we're actually doing this."
00:06:48.158,00:06:49.701,It all happened so fast...
00:06:52.371,00:06:56.457,It all started when Terri's sister Kendra brought her kids over for Sunday brunch.
00:06:56.499,00:07:00.045,"Well, I just don't understand where you're planning on putting the nursery."
00:07:00.087,00:07:00.879,I know.
00:07:00.921,00:07:02.381,We have a second bedroom.
00:07:02.421,00:07:04.299,"You are not giving up your craft room, Terri."
00:07:04.341,00:07:05.466,A mother needs her respite.
00:07:05.508,00:07:11.348,That craft room is the only thing that's going to keep you from going all Susan Smith on that little angel.
00:07:11.390,00:07:13.516,Postpartum runs in our family.
00:07:13.558,00:07:15.352,Where you going?
00:07:15.394,00:07:16.686,Bathroom.
00:07:16.728,00:07:17.729,All that bran.
00:07:17.771,00:07:18.939,"No, you can't."
00:07:18.980,00:07:20.107,Kyle needs his inhaler.
00:07:23.318,00:07:25.486,"Anyway, this conversation is over."
00:07:25.528,00:07:28.990,They're starting construction on a new section of our subdivision.
00:07:29.032,00:07:33.287,You are not bringing my niece or nephew home to this apartment.
00:07:33.328,00:07:34.537,When pigs fly.
00:07:35.914,00:07:38.125,Can I eat this?
00:07:40.252,00:07:42.712,This banister was made by Ecuadorian children.
00:07:42.754,00:07:46.507,"It's great, Terri, but there are nine foreclosures on our street."
00:07:46.549,00:07:48.135,Why can't we buy one of those?
00:07:48.176,00:07:49.386,They're half the price.
00:07:48.176,00:07:51.221,I am not raising our baby in a used house.
00:07:51.263,00:07:52.889,Oh.
00:07:52.931,00:07:54.224,Look at this sun nook.
00:07:54.266,00:07:56.143,Isn't it beautiful?
00:07:56.184,00:07:57.978,Is it extra?
00:07:58.019,00:08:02.565,The price in the brochure is for the basic model-- everything else is Ã  la carte.
00:08:02.607,00:08:08.488,"The grand foyer is an extra $14,000, and the sun nook is an extra 24."
00:08:09.572,00:08:11.241,I'll let you two talk.
00:08:11.283,00:08:13.410,Thank you.
00:08:15.578,00:08:17.331,We can't afford this.
00:08:17.372,00:08:18.457,"We already did the math, Will."
00:08:18.498,00:08:22.419,"All we have to do is give up Applebee's, and we won't run the AC for the first couple of summers."
00:08:22.461,00:08:25.546,"Well, we certainly can't afford the grand foyer, and the sun nook."
00:08:25.588,00:08:29.134,"I mean, if we bite off more than we can chew we'll lose everything."
00:08:29.176,00:08:31.136,You need to pick one.
00:08:31.178,00:08:32.346,Come with me.
00:08:32.387,00:08:34.555,I'm going to show you something really special.
00:08:34.597,00:08:37.558,This is where our daughter or gay son will sleep.
00:08:37.600,00:08:43.148,"I thought maybe we could put one of those mini-pianos in here, and you two could put on shows for me."
00:08:43.190,00:08:44.274,"I love it, Terri."
00:08:44.316,00:08:46.443,But we still can't afford everything.
00:08:49.612,00:08:52.532,It's my very own Sophie's Choice.
00:08:53.616,00:08:55.202,Fine.
00:08:55.243,00:08:57.037,I'm going to give up the sun nook for the grand foyer.
00:08:57.078,00:09:00.165,But I really need the polished door handles.
00:09:00.207,00:09:02.209,"Think of our family, Will."
00:09:02.250,00:09:03.960,This is our dream.
00:09:04.002,00:09:13.178,"WILL: I knew in that moment that I would do whatever it took, even if it meant getting a part-time job to make some extra money, to make that dream come true."
00:09:13.220,00:09:15.222,Let's go sign those papers.
00:09:16.723,00:09:18.850,Yes!
00:09:18.892,00:09:20.601,You need to call me before you dress yourself.
00:09:20.643,00:09:22.396,You look like a Technicolor zebra.
00:09:22.437,00:09:24.231,And I look like I'm a partier.
00:09:24.272,00:09:25.606,You're trying to copy me.
00:09:25.648,00:09:26.691,You know what?
00:09:25.648,00:09:28.026,If you're hair was longer you'd have curls.
00:09:28.068,00:09:29.194,How about a little Kanye?
00:09:30.362,00:09:31.446,For the assembly?
00:09:31.488,00:09:32.613,"No, we won't be ready in time."
00:09:32.655,00:09:33.781,We're still doing disco.
00:09:33.823,00:09:38.453,"But we can fold this into our repertoire, and it'll be awesome at Regionals."
00:09:38.495,00:09:42.207,Communication is the foundation of any successful music group.
00:09:42.249,00:09:44.876,If we're going to succeed we need to communicate.
00:09:44.918,00:09:46.920,"You guys said you wanted modern music, I listened."
00:09:46.961,00:09:50.631,"Mr. Shue, we'd really like to not do disco at that assembly."
00:09:50.673,00:09:52.008,"Finn, you're going to take the solo."
00:09:52.050,00:09:53.885,"What? No, I-I can't do the solo, Mr. Shue."
00:09:53.927,00:09:57.305,I'm still learning- learning how to walk and sing at the same time.
00:09:58.348,00:10:00.308,No problem.
00:10:00.350,00:10:01.435,I'll walk you through it.
00:10:01.476,00:10:03.228,ALL: Ooh.
00:10:03.270,00:10:04.271,Challenge.
00:10:04.312,00:10:05.730,"Mercedes, you know this?"
00:10:05.772,00:10:07.774,"Oh, I got this."
00:12:01.179,00:12:02.347,That was fun.
00:12:02.389,00:12:04.349,"All right, just like that. Ready?"
00:12:19.113,00:12:21.408,"Rachel, did you just throw up?"
00:12:21.449,00:12:22.409,No.
00:12:22.450,00:12:23.784,You missed the toilet.
00:12:23.826,00:12:26.371,The girl who was throwing up before me left that.
00:12:26.413,00:12:29.624,"I tried, but I guess I just don't have a gag reflex."
00:12:29.666,00:12:33.086,"One day when you're older, that'll turn out to be a gift."
00:12:33.127,00:12:34.753,"Let's have a little chat, okay?"
00:12:49.310,00:12:55.066,"Rachel, bulimia is a very messy, serious disease."
00:12:55.108,00:12:56.735,I don't have bulimia.
00:12:56.775,00:13:00.447,"I tried it and failed, and won't ever attempt it again."
00:13:00.488,00:13:01.406,Okay.
00:13:01.448,00:13:02.699,It grossed me out.
00:13:02.741,00:13:07.662,"Okay, but I still want to talk about the feelings that you had that led up to you wanting to puke your guts out."
00:13:07.704,00:13:08.829,I want to be thinner.
00:13:10.457,00:13:11.750,And prettier like that Quinn girl.
00:13:11.790,00:13:14.127,"Mm-hmm, and, um, why is that?"
00:13:14.168,00:13:20.091,"Have you ever liked somebody so much you just want to lock yourself in your room, turn on sad music and cry?"
00:13:22.469,00:13:24.679,No.
00:13:28.975,00:13:30.310,By myself.
00:13:30.351,00:13:31.645,I'm by myself.
00:13:33.396,00:13:35.940,"Uh, but a boy crush, huh?"
00:13:35.982,00:13:37.858,I know about that.
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.444,It takes me back in the day.
00:13:39.486,00:13:41.571,"Like, a long time ago I knew about that."
00:13:41.613,00:13:44.741,"You know what? You need to remember, Rachel, to protect your heart."
00:13:44.783,00:13:45.950,I don't care who he is.
00:13:45.992,00:13:49.870,"If he doesn't like you for the way you are, or if he's..."
00:13:48.161,00:13:52.749,"you know, he's married with a baby on the way, that's not worth the heartache."
00:13:52.791,00:13:55.876,You don't want to compromise...
00:13:57.920,00:14:01.591,Have you just tried telling him how you feel?
00:14:02.592,00:14:04.093,He doesn't even notice me.
00:14:04.135,00:14:06.179,I see.
00:14:06.220,00:14:09.182,"Um, okay, well, here's what I think."
00:14:09.223,00:14:12.310,Common interests are the key to romance.
00:14:12.352,00:14:14.145,All right? So find out what he likes.
00:14:14.187,00:14:19.400,"Then he'll see you in a positive way, and maybe you'll end up doing something that you never would have expected."
00:14:34.624,00:14:40.921,SUE: Would you like to tell Principal Figgins and Mr. Schuester what I caught you two doing?
00:14:40.963,00:14:43.341,It just sort of happened.
00:14:44.967,00:14:47.637,"I don't mean to be rude, but I think she's overreacting."
00:14:47.679,00:14:50.139,"You watch your tone, young lady."
00:14:50.181,00:14:51.182,Gay parents encourage rebellion.
00:14:51.224,00:14:52.767,There are studies on this.
00:14:52.809,00:14:54.185,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:14:54.227,00:14:56.354,"All right, tell me what happened, Rachel."
00:14:56.396,00:15:01.942,Finn was worried about having to perform a solo at the pep assembly in front of his chromosomally-challenged friends.
00:15:01.984,00:15:05.739,"I was immediately concerned by his lack of self-esteem, and made a creative preemptive strike."
00:15:05.780,00:15:08.366,"Yeah, pretty much what she said."
00:15:08.408,00:15:14.247,"You know, one of the amazing things about being in the performing arts is that you can parlay it into so many different fields."
00:15:14.288,00:15:15.956,Like Justin Timberlake.
00:15:15.998,00:15:18.209,"He's a singer, but he also has a clothing line."
00:15:18.251,00:15:21.962,"And you know, he makes things like shirts and belts."
00:15:22.004,00:15:24.048,Who is Justin Timberlake?
00:15:24.090,00:15:25.675,RACHEL: It was a two-fold plan.
00:15:25.717,00:15:35.810,"We figured that with the right marketing strategy, we could pull from the entire student body without having an assembly, thus creating the diverse Glee Club this school has been craving."
00:15:42.024,00:15:45.278,That copy machine is for Cheerios use only.
00:15:45.319,00:15:47.363,Paid for by alumni donations.
00:15:47.405,00:15:52.619,I can't begin to fathom the damage you'd have done to the program had you broken it.
00:15:52.660,00:15:53.828,"Hold on a second, Sue."
00:15:53.870,00:15:56.205,"I resent being told to hold on to anything, William."
00:15:56.247,00:15:59.208,I will not be treated like a second-class citizen because of my gender.
00:15:59.250,00:16:07.007,"There is a very clear bureaucracy when it comes to photocopies, and you seem to think that these procedures don't apply to your students."
00:16:07.049,00:16:10.052,It is my strong recommendation that both these students be hobbled.
00:16:12.096,00:16:14.808,How many copies did you guys make?
00:16:14.849,00:16:16.309,17.
00:16:16.350,00:16:19.061,Okay. And how much does a photocopy cost?
00:16:19.103,00:16:20.313,Four and a half cents.
00:16:20.354,00:16:22.273,How about they just pay for the copies?
00:16:22.315,00:16:23.900,I like this compromise.
00:16:23.942,00:16:27.612,"Children, pay Ms. Sylvester, and we'll let you off with a warning."
00:16:27.654,00:16:33.952,"And Sue, I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to personally clean the congealed protein shake off the photocopy room floor."
00:16:33.993,00:16:35.620,That's why we have janitors.
00:16:35.662,00:16:38.038,"Sue, we're in a recession, and concessions must be made."
00:16:38.080,00:16:40.291,I've laid off half the janitorial staff.
00:16:40.333,00:16:42.126,We all need to lend a hand.
00:16:48.132,00:16:51.010,Lady Justice wept today.
00:16:53.304,00:16:55.222,"I'm sorry about that, Mr. Shue."
00:16:55.264,00:16:58.058,I'd like to get the flyers up before lunch tomorrow.
00:16:58.100,00:16:59.435,"You know what, guys?"
00:16:59.477,00:17:02.313,Doing that song is going to kill any chance the Glee Club has.
00:17:02.355,00:17:03.230,It's a terrible idea.
00:17:03.272,00:17:04.732,"I have news for you, Rachel."
00:17:04.774,00:17:07.067,Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.
00:17:07.109,00:17:10.237,"We're doing the assembly, and you're not putting up those flyers."
00:17:10.279,00:17:12.365,Everybody loves disco!
00:17:14.116,00:17:16.076,It's official.
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.037,I'm a dead man.
00:17:19.121,00:17:24.293,"Look, I know you're nervous, but you're really, really talented."
00:17:24.335,00:17:26.086,Stop it.
00:17:26.128,00:17:28.047,"I mean, maybe it'll all be okay."
00:17:29.966,00:17:33.093,Do you want to practice for the assembly tomorrow after school?
00:17:33.135,00:17:35.638,I can't. I got a Celibacy Club meeting.
00:17:42.436,00:17:45.314,"Baby, I have some bad news."
00:17:45.356,00:17:47.316,A wealthy relative died?
00:17:47.358,00:17:49.109,I don't have any wealthy relatives.
00:17:49.151,00:17:50.277,Oh.
00:17:50.319,00:17:53.155,I've just been pounding the pavement all week after Glee rehearsal.
00:17:53.197,00:17:56.116,I... I can't find any extra work.
00:17:56.158,00:17:59.119,That probably means no grand foyer.
00:17:59.161,00:18:02.122,Why can't we ever be the ones to catch a break?
00:18:02.164,00:18:04.124,"No, no. It's going to be okay, baby."
00:18:04.166,00:18:06.836,"I mean, we don't need a grand foyer to be happy..."
00:18:06.878,00:18:09.338,No. You know what? I'm so tired of the compromising.
00:18:09.380,00:18:12.508,"I want my grand foyer, I want my dream house."
00:18:12.550,00:18:17.096,"I work hard, I sacrifice, I deserve it."
00:18:18.056,00:18:19.849,"You know, we give and we give."
00:18:19.891,00:18:25.354,Do you think that the big shots at Sheets N' Things care that I sell more personal massagers than any other assistant manager?
00:18:25.396,00:18:35.197,No. Or do you think that those kids-- that they give a damn that we go with so little because you spend all your spare time choreographing those stupid dance routines?
00:18:35.239,00:18:39.786,"I mean, when does anyone start giving back?"
00:19:00.222,00:19:03.183,I thought you asked Sue to clean up after herself.
00:19:03.225,00:19:09.189,Sue got a note from the school nurse claiming that her lupus made it impossible to bend over a bucket of suds.
00:19:09.231,00:19:14.654,I've been here till 10:00 p.m. every night up to my elbows in Vamoose.
00:19:17.406,00:19:21.452,Any problem with me taking over one of those nighttime janitorial slots?
00:19:23.329,00:19:25.832,I'll work at half salary.
00:19:32.630,00:19:35.633,The Celibacy Club is now in session.
00:19:35.675,00:19:42.181,"Thanks to a school rule that says we have to let anyone join the club, we're welcoming a new member this week."
00:19:43.265,00:19:45.143,Rachel Whatshername.
00:19:45.184,00:19:46.602,Where are all the boys?
00:19:46.644,00:19:48.228,Down the hall.
00:19:48.270,00:19:49.647,"First half hour, we separate."
00:19:49.689,00:19:52.108,Then we come together to share our faith.
00:19:52.150,00:19:55.653,FINN: I'm still on the fence about the Celibacy Club.
00:19:55.695,00:19:59.323,"I mean, I only joined to get into Quinn Fabray's pants."
00:19:59.365,00:20:04.704,"Still, it is a productive way for us guys to get together and talk about sexual issues."
00:20:04.745,00:20:06.497,I think I'm going to kill myself.
00:20:06.539,00:20:08.248,I'm serious.
00:20:08.290,00:20:10.417,We're bombarded with sexual imagery every day.
00:20:10.459,00:20:11.878,"Beer ads, those short skirts."
00:20:11.919,00:20:16.256,"I'm supposed to be surrounded by temptation, not be able to do anything about it?"
00:20:16.298,00:20:18.051,Are you kidding?
00:20:18.092,00:20:20.553,Those skirts are crunchy toast.
00:20:20.594,00:20:26.225,"Santana Lopez bent over in hers the other day, and I swear I could see her ovaries."
00:20:27.935,00:20:30.063,God bless the perv that invented these.
00:20:30.104,00:20:32.314,"Remember the power motto, girls."
00:20:32.356,00:20:35.275,ALL: It's all about the teasing and not about the pleasing.
00:20:35.317,00:20:37.277,Oh!
00:20:35.317,00:20:38.654,"Back it up like a dump truck, baby."
00:20:38.696,00:20:41.199,"So, how far does Quinn let you get anyway?"
00:20:41.240,00:20:44.284,"We grind, make out."
00:20:44.326,00:20:47.287,But how do you keep from... arriving early?
00:20:47.329,00:20:51.458,"Whenever I grind, Cinco de Mayo."
00:20:52.793,00:20:54.837,"It's not a problem for me, man."
00:20:56.172,00:20:57.757,"Actually, it's a big problem."
00:20:57.798,00:21:02.553,"Somebody once told me that to keep from erupting too early, you should think of dead kittens and stuff."
00:21:02.595,00:21:08.017,But the only image that works for me happened the day my mom took me out to practice for my driver's permit.
00:21:08.059,00:21:09.309,"Pretty good, honey."
00:21:09.351,00:21:11.311,"Who says a father figure's necessary, huh?"
00:21:12.354,00:21:13.814,Driving's fun.
00:21:15.357,00:21:16.358,"Oh, my God!"
00:21:16.400,00:21:18.694,"Oh, my! Oh, my!"
00:21:18.736,00:21:20.780,What are you gonna do?
00:21:20.821,00:21:23.532,Let's pair up for the Immaculate Affection.
00:21:23.574,00:21:28.328,"Now, remember, if the balloon pops, the noise makes the angels cry."
00:21:42.384,00:21:44.344,You enchant me.
00:21:44.386,00:21:45.429,BOY: Yeah.
00:21:45.471,00:21:46.931,Stop it!
00:21:46.973,00:21:48.808,"Ah, yeah!"
00:21:48.849,00:21:50.350,Finn!
00:21:50.392,00:21:52.394,It must have hit my zipper.
00:21:52.436,00:21:54.814,You know what?
00:21:55.815,00:22:00.360,Did you know that most studies have demonstrated that celibacy doesn't work in high schools?
00:22:00.402,00:22:03.781,Our hormones are driving us too crazy to abstain.
00:22:03.823,00:22:07.367,"The second we start telling ourselves that there's no room for compromise, we act out."
00:22:07.409,00:22:10.955,The only way to deal with teen sexuality is to be prepared.
00:22:10.997,00:22:12.581,That's what contraception is for.
00:22:12.623,00:22:14.625,Don't you dare mention the C word.
00:22:14.667,00:22:19.213,You want to know a dirty little secret that none of them want you to know?
00:22:20.422,00:22:22.382,Girls want sex just as much as guys do.
00:22:26.428,00:22:29.307,Is-Is that accurate?
00:22:36.939,00:22:39.399,Will?
00:22:39.441,00:22:40.776,Aah... aah.
00:22:40.818,00:22:43.946,Emma... what are you doing here so late?
00:22:44.905,00:22:47.407,I do SAT prep on Tuesday nights.
00:22:47.449,00:22:49.409,"Are you, um, are you a janitor?"
00:22:49.451,00:22:51.411,A ja-- no.
00:22:51.453,00:22:52.663,Really?
00:22:52.705,00:22:56.416,'Cause you're dressed like a janitor and your shirt says Will.
00:22:56.458,00:23:02.048,"Um... Terri and I are trying to buy a house and we're, you know, struggling to make ends meet, and..."
00:23:04.342,00:23:08.721,I'm really embarrassed.
00:23:08.762,00:23:10.890,Would you mind keeping this between us?
00:23:10.931,00:23:13.017,Yeah.
00:23:13.059,00:23:16.229,"Oh, yeah, your secret's completely safe with me."
00:23:16.270,00:23:17.938,Thank you.
00:23:17.980,00:23:19.690,"Do you, um..."
00:23:19.732,00:23:21.067,Do you want a hand?
00:23:21.108,00:23:22.442,"Oh, no."
00:23:22.484,00:23:23.694,"I-I'm good, really."
00:23:23.736,00:23:28.448,"Really, because, um, I can see from here that you've used window cleaner to mop the floor."
00:23:28.490,00:23:33.495,"And, uh, that keyboard is crawling in E coli, because I know for a fact Ms. Hoffmeyer doesn't wash her hands after doing number twos."
00:23:38.292,00:23:41.295,I really admire you working so hard for something you want.
00:23:42.504,00:23:43.547,Let's make a deal.
00:23:43.589,00:23:47.467,"You're helping me with my problem, how about I take a stab at one of yours?"
00:23:47.509,00:23:50.846,"Oh, no, I don't, I don't have a problem."
00:23:50.888,00:23:53.473,You've been scrubbing that pencil sharpener for an hour.
00:23:53.515,00:23:59.479,"Well, I mean, I have, I have a little trouble with messes, but it's not like it's a..."
00:24:05.443,00:24:06.987,Okay.
00:24:07.029,00:24:11.409,"When I was a little girl, it was my dream to work on a dairy farm."
00:24:11.449,00:24:12.910,Really?
00:24:12.952,00:24:21.710,"Um, when I was eight, we finally visited one, and after the tour and the yogurt tasting, my, my brother pushed me into the runoff lagoon."
00:24:21.752,00:24:23.003,What?
00:24:23.045,00:24:25.505,"And, um, ever since then I've just..."
00:24:25.547,00:24:29.467,"I've had a little trouble forgetting the, uh, the smell."
00:24:31.262,00:24:34.723,"Have you thought about, I don't know, maybe seeing someone about that?"
00:24:34.765,00:24:36.976,"Oh, no, it's completely manageable."
00:24:37.017,00:24:40.520,"You know, I just try to take lots of showers and I, um, you know, I don't eat dairy."
00:24:40.562,00:24:42.522,So...
00:24:43.565,00:24:46.152,It's not a big...
00:24:48.570,00:24:50.530,...a little experiment.
00:24:50.572,00:24:55.744,"Oh, no. No, I'm not really, um, comfortable with, with... that."
00:25:06.088,00:25:07.505,There.
00:25:09.467,00:25:11.551,Ten seconds.
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.762,New record.
00:25:17.433,00:25:20.436,"It's late. I should, um..."
00:25:20.478,00:25:23.272,"I should be, um... going."
00:25:31.780,00:25:35.784,I officially call this meeting of Glee Club in session.
00:25:35.826,00:25:38.078,But Mr. Schuester isn't here.
00:25:38.120,00:25:41.581,I paid a freshman to ask him for help with irregular verbs.
00:25:41.623,00:25:44.251,"I'm so sick of hearing you squawk, Eva Peron."
00:25:44.293,00:25:45.543,Let her talk.
00:25:47.338,00:25:50.508,I have another idea for the assembly.
00:25:50.548,00:25:53.593,"Can I, once again, stress my most strenuous objections to this attempted suicide?"
00:25:53.635,00:25:54.845,They're not going to kill us.
00:25:54.887,00:25:56.472,Because we're going to give them what they want.
00:25:56.514,00:25:58.598,Blood?
00:25:58.640,00:26:01.310,Sex.
00:26:03.645,00:26:05.022,"Silence, children."
00:26:05.064,00:26:06.648,Silence.
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.817,"First, an announcement."
00:26:08.859,00:26:11.487,The toilets are broken again.
00:26:11.529,00:26:15.115,"We are fixing the problem, but let me warn you."
00:26:15.157,00:26:20.204,There will be zero tolerance for anyone soiling school grounds.
00:26:20.246,00:26:23.123,We're not going to have a repeat of last time.
00:26:24.250,00:26:25.876,We have a treat for you guys today.
00:26:25.918,00:26:27.627,Mr. Schuester.
00:26:27.669,00:26:29.629,"Yay, Glee!"
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.507,"Glee kids, hooray!"
00:26:31.549,00:26:37.096,"Hi. Uh, when I went to school here, Glee Club ruled this place."
00:26:37.137,00:26:38.638,And we're on our way back.
00:26:38.680,00:26:40.640,But we need some recruits to join the party.
00:26:40.682,00:26:49.525,"Now, I could tell you all about how great Glee is, but, uh, I think I'm going to let some friends of mine show you instead."
00:28:53.190,00:28:54.608,Yes!
00:29:08.038,00:29:10.290,Let me be the one to break the silence.
00:29:11.667,00:29:16.255,That was the most offensive thing I've seen in 20 years of teaching.
00:29:16.296,00:29:18.840,And that includes an elementary school production of Hair.
00:29:18.882,00:29:28.726,"We received angry e-mails from a number of concerned parents, many of whom thought that their children were going to hear a Special Olympian speak about overcoming adversity."
00:29:28.767,00:29:31.311,I... I really don't know what to say.
00:29:31.353,00:29:33.272,"Well, let me help you out then."
00:29:33.313,00:29:37.401,My first thought was that your students should be put into foster care.
00:29:39.027,00:29:41.655,But you're the one who should be punished.
00:29:41.697,00:29:47.286,"I demand your resignation from this school, as well as the disbanding of Glee Club."
00:29:47.327,00:29:48.662,"Now, hold on, Sue."
00:29:48.704,00:29:49.747,The issue is content.
00:29:49.788,00:29:51.123,Those kids are talented.
00:29:51.164,00:29:56.086,And I have not seen the student body this excited since Tiffany performed at the North Hills Mall.
00:29:58.297,00:30:05.429,I took the liberty of calling my pastor to provide a list of family-friendly songs that reflect our community's values.
00:30:05.471,00:30:08.140,Your kids can only perform these pre-approved musical selections.
00:30:08.181,00:30:12.852,But all these songs have either Jesus or balloons in the title.
00:30:12.894,00:30:14.854,But they're also songs about the circus.
00:30:14.896,00:30:17.691,"This egg is sunny-side up, Will."
00:30:17.733,00:30:19.318,You need new outfits.
00:30:19.359,00:30:24.072,"I got several flashes of panty from your group today, and I'm not talking about the girls."
00:30:24.114,00:30:29.453,"So, Sue, I'm cutting your dry-cleaning budget to pay for new costumes for the Glee Club."
00:30:29.495,00:30:31.871,This will not stand.
00:30:31.913,00:30:33.582,"Oh, Sue."
00:30:33.624,00:30:37.628,The dry-cleaners here are just as good as the ones in Europe.
00:30:44.718,00:30:45.969,"Mr. Schuester, I'm so sorry."
00:30:46.011,00:30:48.888,Do you understand what you did today? You lied to me.
00:30:48.930,00:30:51.266,And you ruined our chances.
00:30:48.930,00:30:53.059,No parent in their right mind is going to let their kid join Glee now.
00:30:53.101,00:30:55.729,"Oh, and, uh, here's a list of the songs that we're allowed to sing."
00:30:55.771,00:30:57.897,What's a luftballoon?
00:30:57.939,00:31:00.734,"Look, I know how much you care about Glee Club."
00:31:00.776,00:31:03.320,And I understand why you did what you did.
00:31:03.362,00:31:06.448,But I don't like the way you did it.
00:31:26.968,00:31:28.554,They're for Tulip-A-Looza.
00:31:29.471,00:31:31.431,It's a tulip festival down at the Columbus Convention Center.
00:31:31.473,00:31:32.599,It's supposed to smell pretty nice.
00:31:32.641,00:31:36.729,"That's really sweet of you, Ken, but I have a... asthma."
00:31:36.770,00:31:39.398,What are you doing?
00:31:39.439,00:31:40.691,Chasing a married guy.
00:31:41.983,00:31:44.653,"I saw you playing house with him after hours, Emma."
00:31:44.695,00:31:46.363,Look.
00:31:46.405,00:31:48.323,I don't know a lot about relationships.
00:31:48.365,00:31:52.994,"Most of mine are short and flame out once the sex goes, but I do know you never want to be the rebounder."
00:31:54.913,00:31:56.832,"I'm a good man, Emma."
00:31:56.874,00:31:59.209,I'll treat you right.
00:31:59.251,00:32:03.380,"They can't fire me 'cause I'm a minority, so I'll always be able to provide for you."
00:32:03.422,00:32:07.926,"You could do a lot worse, and in this town, you're not going to do much better."
00:32:09.386,00:32:11.388,"Okay, I'm done talking now."
00:32:16.643,00:32:17.477,Try it.
00:32:18.520,00:32:19.772,Good.
00:32:19.813,00:32:21.481,"Okay, one more up."
00:32:23.024,00:32:24.443,That was really good.
00:32:24.484,00:32:28.655,"Yeah, it's like the Holy Grail for a baritenor, so it's a good note."
00:32:28.697,00:32:31.450,"All right, I'll start at the bottom and then we'll go up higher."
00:32:31.491,00:32:32.492,Can we take a break?
00:32:32.534,00:32:33.911,Singing kind of makes me a little hungry.
00:32:33.952,00:32:34.994,"Yeah, sure."
00:32:35.036,00:32:36.996,"Well, lucky I prepared for that."
00:32:37.038,00:32:39.249,"Wow, I was wondering what that was all about."
00:32:39.291,00:32:41.460,Want to sit?
00:32:41.501,00:32:43.086,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:43.128,00:32:44.463,Absolutely.
00:32:44.504,00:32:47.883,I was wondering why you asked me to help you with your singing.
00:32:49.050,00:32:50.677,You kicked butt at the assembly.
00:32:50.719,00:32:51.845,"Well, this is..."
00:32:51.887,00:32:55.724,"my only chance to be, you know, good like you."
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.602,You think I'm good?
00:32:58.644,00:33:01.020,"Well, when I first joined, I thought you were kind of insane."
00:33:01.062,00:33:07.903,"I mean, you talk a lot more than you should, and to be honest with you, I looked under the bed and made sure that you weren't hanging out under there."
00:33:09.070,00:33:11.030,"But then, I heard you sing."
00:33:11.072,00:33:14.534,"I don't know how to say this, but you touched something in me."
00:33:15.744,00:33:18.330,Right here.
00:33:18.371,00:33:22.626,Your heart's on the other side of your chest.
00:33:22.668,00:33:25.211,Oh.
00:33:25.253,00:33:27.547,It's beating really hard.
00:33:29.508,00:33:32.010,"You're cool, Rachel."
00:33:33.094,00:33:34.095,Do you want a drink?
00:33:34.137,00:33:36.139,Yeah.
00:33:37.307,00:33:39.768,Virgin cosmos.
00:33:41.019,00:33:43.438,"That stuff you said at the Celibacy Club, that was really cool."
00:33:43.480,00:33:45.273,Thanks.
00:33:45.315,00:33:47.233,Well...
00:33:47.275,00:33:48.944,Cheers.
00:33:48.986,00:33:50.069,Cheers.
00:33:50.111,00:33:53.198,The cups are like the airplane cups.
00:33:57.118,00:33:59.078,"Oh, you got a little cosmo right..."
00:33:59.120,00:34:01.039,Here.
00:34:05.335,00:34:07.838,"You know, you can kiss me if you want to."
00:34:09.381,00:34:11.508,I want to.
00:34:35.156,00:34:36.491,What?
00:34:36.533,00:34:39.327,"Oh, my God!"
00:34:39.369,00:34:40.829,What are you gonna do?!
00:34:40.871,00:34:41.788,Did I do something wrong?
00:34:41.830,00:34:44.123,"No, no. Um..."
00:34:44.165,00:34:47.252,"Look, please don't tell anybody about this, okay?"
00:34:57.178,00:35:02.768,I don't want my baby to grow an extra arm just because I live in squalor and I'm so stressed.
00:35:02.809,00:35:05.604,"So, I want you to run any and all tests you have."
00:35:05.645,00:35:07.439,"Trust me, you're clear."
00:35:07.480,00:35:08.732,Are you sure?
00:35:08.774,00:35:09.441,Positive.
00:35:09.482,00:35:11.735,Is it a boy or a girl?
00:35:11.777,00:35:14.362,Um...
00:35:14.404,00:35:16.990,I don't quite know how to put this.
00:35:17.032,00:35:18.784,There's no baby.
00:35:18.825,00:35:20.535,Did it fall out?
00:35:22.203,00:35:23.747,"Uh, no. Um..."
00:35:23.789,00:35:25.082,You're not pregnant.
00:35:25.123,00:35:26.207,But I've gained ten pounds.
00:35:26.249,00:35:30.670,It's probably from eating. I can see a chicken wing in there that you must have swallowed whole.
00:35:30.712,00:35:33.048,You're having what's called a hysterical pregnancy.
00:35:33.090,00:35:37.594,You want a baby so badly that your body mimics the symptoms.
00:35:40.221,00:35:43.683,"If you're meant to get pregnant, it'll happen."
00:35:53.443,00:35:55.445,"I have to say, I'm really surprised you guys are trying out."
00:35:55.487,00:35:58.197,I'm sure you've read about this in the school paper.
00:35:58.239,00:36:03.829,"Finn and I have been an item for a while now, so what kind of girlfriend would I be if I didn't support him?"
00:36:03.870,00:36:06.205,"Well, let's see what you've got."
00:36:57.298,00:36:58.717,SUE: Let me get this straight.
00:36:58.758,00:37:00.760,You're joining Glee Club?
00:37:00.802,00:37:05.974,"I'm sorry, Coach Sylvester, but something is going on between Finn and that thing."
00:37:06.016,00:37:09.102,You saw how it was undressing him with its eyes.
00:37:09.144,00:37:11.312,Please don't kick us off the Cheerios.
00:37:11.354,00:37:13.272,Cease fire on the waterworks.
00:37:13.314,00:37:15.108,I don't want to hear it.
00:37:15.150,00:37:22.699,"You know, Q, when I first laid eyes on you, I was reminded of a young Sue Sylvester, though you don't have my bone structure."
00:37:22.741,00:37:28.621,"But it wasn't until this very moment, I saw how alike we really are."
00:37:30.623,00:37:33.168,You three are going to be my spies.
00:37:33.210,00:37:35.921,I need eyes on the inside.
00:37:35.962,00:37:39.091,We're going to bring this club down from within.
00:37:40.633,00:37:43.511,And I'm going to get my boyfriend back.
00:37:43.553,00:37:46.765,I don't care so much about that.
00:37:54.856,00:37:56.566,"Hey, Emma."
00:37:56.608,00:37:58.610,I found these new disinfecting bleach wipes.
00:37:58.651,00:38:00.486,What do you say?
00:38:00.528,00:38:03.322,Boys bathroom in the science wing?
00:38:03.364,00:38:04.783,9:00?
00:38:04.824,00:38:07.244,"Will, what are we doing?"
00:38:07.285,00:38:10.163,"I mean, you're having a baby."
00:38:13.583,00:38:16.836,"Um, and anyway, uh..."
00:38:16.878,00:38:18.337,I have a date.
00:38:18.379,00:38:20.423,"Oh, that's great."
00:38:20.465,00:38:22.341,"Yeah, but, with who?"
00:38:22.383,00:38:25.178,I'm going to go to Tulip-A-Looza.
00:38:25.220,00:38:26.596,With Ken.
00:38:47.242,00:38:49.535,There's my man.
00:38:49.577,00:38:51.246,Bringing home the bacon.
00:38:51.288,00:38:54.040,You... You made dinner.
00:38:54.082,00:38:55.458,I thought you'd be asleep.
00:38:55.500,00:39:00.630,"Well, I wanted to talk to you about something, so I made you chicken pot pie."
00:39:00.672,00:39:01.631,From scratch.
00:39:03.216,00:39:05.593,"Terri, that's so thoughtful. I..."
00:39:08.805,00:39:12.475,"I've been working so hard lately, some-- Sometimes I forget what I'm doing it for."
00:39:12.517,00:39:15.394,Family's what's important to me.
00:39:15.436,00:39:19.440,You and the little guy or gal on the way.
00:39:19.482,00:39:20.650,I hope you know that.
00:39:20.692,00:39:22.319,Yeah.
00:39:22.360,00:39:25.404,I'm sorry. What was it you wanted to talk about?
00:39:25.446,00:39:28.491,I went to the baby doctor today.
00:39:28.533,00:39:30.202,And?
00:39:30.243,00:39:32.162,And...
00:39:33.663,00:39:36.249,It's a boy.
00:39:37.959,00:39:40.337,"Oh, my God."
00:39:40.378,00:39:41.713,"Oh, my God."
00:39:41.754,00:39:42.630,Oh!
00:39:43.631,00:39:45.717,I want you to give up being a janitor.
00:39:45.758,00:39:46.718,What?
00:39:46.759,00:39:48.427,Yeah. We don't need a new house.
00:39:48.469,00:39:50.596,We'll turn my craft room into a nursery.
00:39:50.638,00:39:52.431,It's a compromise that I want to make.
00:39:52.473,00:39:53.683,Really?
00:39:53.725,00:39:55.518,Yeah.
00:39:55.560,00:39:58.437,You know the only project that I want to work on now...
00:39:58.479,00:40:00.773,is us.
00:40:02.692,00:40:03.860,I love you so much.
00:40:12.493,00:40:15.496,You're giving Quinn Fabray the solo?
00:40:15.538,00:40:17.123,That's my solo.
00:40:17.165,00:40:18.499,"You made this happen, Rachel."
00:40:18.541,00:40:20.459,You were the one who wanted to sell sex at the assembly.
00:40:20.501,00:40:25.048,"Quinn's audition song was on Figgins's approved list, and frankly, she did a heck of a job singing it."
00:40:25.090,00:40:26.465,You're punishing me.
00:40:26.507,00:40:29.635,"Contrary to your beliefs, it's not all about you."
00:40:29.677,00:40:34.473,"Or, I've realized, about me."
00:40:34.515,00:40:35.892,"Look, I screwed up, too."
00:40:35.934,00:40:39.979,I'm as responsible for what you did at that assembly as you are.
00:40:40.021,00:40:42.148,I should never have pushed disco so hard.
00:40:42.190,00:40:47.112,"When we did it back in '93, the disco revival was in its heyday."
00:40:47.153,00:40:49.530,It was cool. We had fun.
00:40:49.572,00:40:53.534,And that... That is what Glee is supposed to be about.
00:40:53.576,00:40:58.331,"If we're going to succeed, we both need to change our mindsets."
00:40:58.373,00:41:00.125,You're not always going to be the star.
00:41:00.166,00:41:04.503,But I promise to do my best to make sure you're always having fun.
00:41:04.545,00:41:06.505,"This is a good thing, Rachel."
00:41:06.547,00:41:09.801,We're on our way.
00:41:09.842,00:41:12.762,Can I use the auditorium later to practice?
00:41:12.804,00:41:15.014,Our neighbors are filing a lawsuit.
00:41:15.056,00:41:16.933,Sure.
00:00:05.464,00:00:07.048,"When did you start cooking, Terri?"
00:00:07.090,00:00:09.050,"Oh, it's just hamburger casserole."
00:00:09.092,00:00:11.010,Look out for bones.
00:00:15.098,00:00:17.058,"I'm sorry. I, um..."
00:00:18.811,00:00:20.521,I can't hold it in any longer.
00:00:20.562,00:00:21.772,Um...
00:00:21.814,00:00:25.024,"Mom, Dad."
00:00:26.109,00:00:28.362,Terri's pregnant.
00:00:28.403,00:00:30.071,It's a boy.
00:00:30.948,00:00:32.073,Our first grandbaby!
00:00:34.618,00:00:36.077,"Oh, that's fantastic."
00:00:36.119,00:00:37.162,"Thank you, yeah."
00:00:37.204,00:00:40.081,Yeah?
00:00:40.123,00:00:44.085,"Oh your secret is safe with me. I spent six months in the Hanoi Hilton, never said a word."
00:00:45.587,00:00:47.548,Oh.
00:00:47.589,00:00:49.550,"Yeah, we're going to turn the craft room into the nursery."
00:00:49.591,00:00:51.760,Show me!
00:00:51.802,00:00:53.094,Okay.
00:00:59.518,00:01:01.562,"I'm really happy for you, son."
00:01:01.603,00:01:04.606,"Tell you the truth, I'm terrified."
00:01:04.648,00:01:06.316,I don't know how to do this.
00:01:06.358,00:01:07.735,No one does.
00:01:07.776,00:01:09.361,Look at me. I was a mess.
00:01:09.403,00:01:12.781,"I worked all the time, traveling."
00:01:12.823,00:01:14.033,I was too strict.
00:01:14.074,00:01:17.828,"Okay, you're not instilling me with a great deal of confidence here, Dad."
00:01:19.162,00:01:23.124,"I mean, I'm already up all night thinking about this."
00:01:27.170,00:01:29.381,Boys learn that from their fathers.
00:01:30.966,00:01:34.553,I started at Zuckerman and Zuckerman in college.
00:01:34.595,00:01:36.972,I needed some extra cash.
00:01:37.014,00:01:38.097,I was saving up...
00:01:39.182,00:01:41.727,...for law school.
00:01:41.769,00:01:44.145,But I never went.
00:01:44.187,00:01:46.440,I never even applied.
00:01:46.481,00:01:48.025,Didn't have the balls.
00:01:48.067,00:01:49.651,"So, I settled for insurance."
00:01:49.693,00:01:51.612,"I mean, who was I to become a lawyer?"
00:01:51.653,00:01:54.155,You would have been a great one.
00:01:54.197,00:01:55.156,You're the smartest guy I know.
00:01:55.198,00:01:57.367,"It's not about brains, son."
00:02:00.203,00:02:06.668,"Being a good father-- hell, being a man-- is all about one thing: Guts."
00:02:06.710,00:02:11.131,And you've got about six months to figure out if you have any.
00:02:14.217,00:02:18.639,"WILL: Five, six, seven, eight. Step and step."
00:02:18.680,00:02:20.849,Step and step.
00:02:20.891,00:02:24.103,And turn it around.
00:02:24.144,00:02:25.020,Down and up.
00:02:25.062,00:02:28.023,"And hit, hit..."
00:02:28.065,00:02:30.191,"Can we stop, please?"
00:02:30.233,00:02:33.570,"You don't have to ask me every time for permission to go to the bathroom, Rachel."
00:02:33.612,00:02:34.655,It's not my bladder.
00:02:35.614,00:02:37.032,It's the choreography.
00:02:37.074,00:02:39.118,"Okay, what's wrong with the choreography?"
00:02:41.244,00:02:43.831,Are you guys going to get shunned for talking to me?
00:02:43.872,00:02:46.875,"Sweetie, we're a team now."
00:02:46.917,00:02:49.628,But you've got to do something about Mr. Shue's dance routines.
00:02:52.255,00:02:58.219,"You're a great vocal coach, Mr. Shue, but you're not a..."
00:02:58.261,00:03:01.598,That's what we need to be the best.
00:03:01.640,00:03:03.517,We need Dakota Stanley.
00:03:03.558,00:03:06.394,He's the best show choir choreographer in the Midwest.
00:03:06.436,00:03:08.022,We works with Vocal Adrenaline.
00:03:08.063,00:03:09.230,You can't take regionals without him.
00:03:09.272,00:03:13.902,He was the understudy to the candelabra in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway.
00:03:13.944,00:03:17.405,Just because he understudied doesn't mean he ever performed.
00:03:17.447,00:03:18.991,"Did you ever perform, Mr. Schuester?"
00:03:20.492,00:03:23.078,After high school.
00:03:24.579,00:03:27.457,WILL: I wanted to.
00:03:27.499,00:03:28.917,I-I just never had...
00:03:28.959,00:03:30.836,The guts?
00:03:30.878,00:03:33.172,They say it takes more certainty than talent to be a star.
00:03:33.212,00:03:34.673,"I mean, look at, um..."
00:03:34.715,00:03:36.133,Look at John Stamos.
00:03:38.010,00:03:39.136,I don't know.
00:03:39.178,00:03:42.181,I guess I'm also just nervous about being a dad.
00:03:42.222,00:03:44.265,"You know, I want my kid to be proud of me."
00:03:44.307,00:03:46.226,"I want to set a good example, you know?"
00:03:48.478,00:03:51.148,I... I hope it's cool-- me unloading on you like this.
00:03:51.190,00:03:52.273,I don't want there to be any awkwardness.
00:03:52.315,00:03:54.275,"Oh, no. No, none at all."
00:03:54.317,00:03:57.738,"I mean, you know, especially since we're, um, we're both in relationships now."
00:03:57.779,00:03:59.990,It's both of us.
00:04:00.032,00:04:01.282,I'm in a relationship.
00:04:01.324,00:04:03.326,"Exactly, yeah."
00:04:05.037,00:04:06.329,How's it going with Ken?
00:04:06.371,00:04:07.915,Great. It's great.
00:04:07.956,00:04:16.256,"I mean, you know, he's-he's flawed, but he-he knows who he is, and that's-that's great and there really is nothing sexier in a man than confidence, you know?"
00:04:25.390,00:04:26.808,WILL: Sandy!
00:04:26.850,00:04:29.144,I thought you weren't allowed on campus.
00:04:32.940,00:04:35.234,"Besides, Henri and I go way back."
00:04:35.275,00:04:38.112,I got him a job before we even had a shop class.
00:04:45.368,00:04:46.787,Here comes Henri.
00:04:46.828,00:04:48.371,"Ah, shoot."
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.540,Terri was supposed to bring a cake.
00:04:55.003,00:04:56.463,I'm back.
00:04:59.007,00:05:02.761,WILL: Henri had a little problem with over-the-counter cough medicine.
00:05:04.304,00:05:06.932,He ended up cutting off his thumbs.
00:05:06.974,00:05:08.600,It was a real tragedy.
00:05:08.642,00:05:12.520,I'll never hitchhike across Europe.
00:05:12.562,00:05:13.981,"That was a dream, man."
00:05:17.276,00:05:18.735,Where's Terri?
00:05:18.777,00:05:20.154,Doing inventory.
00:05:20.195,00:05:22.322,I can't count higher than 30.
00:05:46.429,00:05:54.437,"You know, This is nice. I can't remember the last time I just hung out with the guys, really talked about our feelings."
00:05:54.479,00:05:56.023,Want to know what I'm feeling?
00:05:56.064,00:05:58.817,I live at the YMCA. I only have one pair of long pants.
00:05:58.859,00:06:06.074,"Oh, please. My life is a disaster with no creative outlet other than writing my Desperate Housewives fan fiction."
00:06:06.116,00:06:08.243,I'm afraid of my vacuum.
00:06:09.452,00:06:11.079,I apparently don't know how to dance.
00:06:11.121,00:06:13.456,I don't have thumbs.
00:06:15.250,00:06:17.085,Uh....
00:06:17.127,00:06:18.670,Sorry.
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.111,"Hey, that was pretty good."
00:06:46.405,00:06:54.664,"Two weeks ago, I would have agreed that four grown men rehearsing a capella hip-hop in my living room was embarrassing."
00:06:54.706,00:06:58.085,But busting out some white-hot New Jack swing...
00:06:58.126,00:06:59.878,"I'll tell you, I've never felt more confident."
00:07:02.672,00:07:04.465,Henri thought we should call our group...
00:07:05.508,00:07:06.509,While Ken thought...
00:07:06.551,00:07:08.469,Testotertones.
00:07:08.511,00:07:13.683,"And then we heard a single word leave Howard's lips, and we knew we had our name."
00:07:13.725,00:07:16.477,Acafellas.
00:07:18.230,00:07:21.649,"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille."
00:07:21.691,00:07:25.946,"Sandy, we voted. When you're in the group, it's creepy."
00:07:25.987,00:07:28.115,Wait. I...
00:07:36.331,00:07:37.999,Will!
00:07:38.041,00:07:40.668,"If I don't get some sleep, I could miscarry."
00:07:40.710,00:07:43.422,"I'm sorry, Terri."
00:07:45.006,00:07:47.050,I hope so.
00:07:52.431,00:07:55.142,Being in a boy band did wonders for our love life.
00:07:55.183,00:08:02.316,Seeing me feel so good about myself made my wife more attracted to me in every way.
00:08:04.401,00:08:08.155,"It was amazing. I mean, we started doing it once a week."
00:08:08.196,00:08:12.533,It was like she was trying to make a twin.
00:08:19.499,00:08:20.541,He's not coming.
00:08:20.583,00:08:22.169,What happened?
00:08:22.210,00:08:24.963,They're my famous sugar cookies.
00:08:25.005,00:08:28.800,"I bake them for the poor during Christmastime, but I whipped up a special batch just for you."
00:08:32.387,00:08:35.140,Don't be. You were right.
00:08:35.182,00:08:39.936,"You know, the truth is, Rachel, if you weren't so hard on me, I never would have had the guts to start Acafellas."
00:08:39.978,00:08:44.024,"But we need you, Mr. Shue."
00:08:44.065,00:08:47.861,"You've missed six rehearsals in the past couple of weeks, and when you're there, you're not really there."
00:08:47.902,00:08:51.281,Which is why I think you should go ahead and hire Montana.
00:08:51.323,00:08:53.325,Dakota.
00:08:53.908,00:09:00.248,"You know, I'll still be there to help you guys sing and stuff, but, uh, I just don't have time for all of it anymore."
00:09:03.251,00:09:06.587,Of course he doesn't want anything to do with us after you kicked him in the nads.
00:09:06.629,00:09:08.048,Then why did he thank me?
00:09:08.089,00:09:10.425,SANTANA: The goal is to win.
00:09:10.467,00:09:15.096,"And now that Mr. Schuester has agreed to let us hire Dakota Stanley, we can."
00:09:15.138,00:09:17.015,But he doesn't want us to.
00:09:15.138,00:09:18.808,He just doesn't have the confidence to coach us anymore.
00:09:18.850,00:09:21.478,Guys are real sensitive when it comes to this kind of stuff.
00:09:21.520,00:09:22.770,And that's my fault?
00:09:22.812,00:09:25.190,Do you see anyone else in here with a plate of I'm sorry cookies?
00:09:25.232,00:09:26.733,I don't. Just you.
00:09:27.650,00:09:29.027,I'm bored.
00:09:29.069,00:09:32.531,All those in favor of hiring Dakota Stanley?
00:09:45.502,00:09:46.669,"Hey, wait up."
00:09:46.711,00:09:48.629,You can't do this to Mr. Schuester.
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.131,What? Make him a hero?
00:09:50.173,00:09:53.843,"Once we hire Dakota and win nationals, he'll thank me for it."
00:09:53.885,00:09:55.636,You heard Santana.
00:09:55.678,00:09:56.804,Since when?
00:09:56.846,00:10:02.643,"Look, you have your popular clique and your football and your clichÃ© of a blond girlfriend Glee is my one shot."
00:10:02.685,00:10:06.106,"If this doesn't work out, then my whole high school life will be nothing but an embarrassment."
00:10:06.147,00:10:08.275,What's a clichÃ©?
00:10:08.316,00:10:09.526,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:10:09.568,00:10:14.948,"Is this one of those chick things where you're pissed about one thing, but you're just pretending like you're pissed about something else?"
00:10:14.989,00:10:16.283,'Cause...
00:10:16.324,00:10:17.658,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:10:17.700,00:10:22.497,"Well, for a while there, you were kind of all over me and now you just yell at me all the time."
00:10:22.539,00:10:24.665,It makes me think that you're still upset about what happened in the auditorium.
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.084,I'm not.
00:10:26.126,00:10:28.086,I've moved on and I'm focusing on my career now.
00:10:28.128,00:10:30.297,So you want to talk about it?
00:10:30.338,00:10:31.756,And neither do you.
00:10:31.798,00:10:41.975,"It's kind of ironic how you're Mr. Popular and I'm just this nobody that everybody makes fun of, but I have enough confidence to say out loud that what happened between us in the auditorium was real."
00:10:42.016,00:10:46.104,You have feelings for me and you just don't have the guts to admit it.
00:10:47.439,00:10:49.316,We're hiring Dakota Stanley.
00:10:51.734,00:10:53.736,Even if it means me quitting?
00:10:57.616,00:10:59.326,Yes.
00:11:14.048,00:11:15.175,It's a good start.
00:11:15.216,00:11:16.593,You're sewing the seeds of destruction.
00:11:16.635,00:11:19.304,Mr. Schuester barely even shows up for rehearsals.
00:11:19.346,00:11:20.347,"Oh, no, no, no."
00:11:20.388,00:11:22.015,Barely will not cut it.
00:11:22.056,00:11:25.185,I will not be satisfied until Glee Club is disbanded.
00:11:25.226,00:11:27.020,And what about this Dakota character?
00:11:27.061,00:11:28.605,Any chance he actually helps?
00:11:28.647,00:11:30.607,They're soft.
00:11:30.649,00:11:32.359,He'll eat them alive.
00:11:32.400,00:11:36.112,I give them 15 minutes before the first one quits or tries to commit suicide.
00:11:36.154,00:11:40.200,"You know, ladies..."
00:11:40.241,00:11:43.119,I learned a lot in Special Forces.
00:11:43.161,00:11:47.207,I was on the strike team in Panama when we extracted Noriega.
00:11:47.248,00:11:49.750,We took out the shepherd...
00:11:49.792,00:11:52.253,then we went after the sheep.
00:11:52.295,00:11:55.965,You need to go after these Glee Clubbers one by one.
00:11:56.007,00:11:59.010,I want my full budget restored.
00:11:59.052,00:12:02.222,I need a fog machine.
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.987,Have you ever kissed anybody?
00:12:18.029,00:12:20.031,Yes.
00:12:20.073,00:12:24.160,If by someone you mean the tender crook of my elbow.
00:12:24.202,00:12:26.580,"No, I haven't."
00:12:26.621,00:12:28.498,But I want to.
00:12:33.878,00:12:35.714,"All right, stop it right there, Mercedes."
00:12:35.754,00:12:37.215,We are in Glee Club.
00:12:37.257,00:12:40.260,That means we are at the bottom of the social heap.
00:12:40.301,00:12:42.679,Special ed kids will get more play than we will.
00:12:42.721,00:12:48.309,The only thing that gets me by is my knowledge that we are superior to all of them.
00:12:52.146,00:12:55.525,What are you wearing on our Operation Dakota Stanley field trip?
00:12:55.567,00:12:56.901,Is there a dress code?
00:12:56.943,00:13:00.405,"No, but every moment of your life is an opportunity for fashion."
00:13:00.447,00:13:02.198,We'll hit the mall after school.
00:13:02.240,00:13:04.242,Meet me at lunch.
00:13:05.868,00:13:08.288,You should totally scoop that.
00:13:08.329,00:13:09.914,I don't think I'm his type.
00:13:09.956,00:13:12.250,"Oh, I think you are."
00:13:12.292,00:13:13.834,Just follow our lead.
00:13:13.876,00:13:15.253,We've got your back.
00:14:32.747,00:14:33.914,"Yay, Ken."
00:14:33.956,00:14:36.835,Ken Tanaka.
00:14:36.876,00:14:41.631,"WILL: In my own little way, I felt like I was finally..."
00:14:41.673,00:14:42.549,a star.
00:14:42.590,00:14:44.175,Thank you so much.
00:14:45.343,00:14:46.720,Acafellas!
00:14:46.761,00:14:47.928,Hey!
00:14:47.970,00:14:49.222,"Son, this is huge."
00:14:49.263,00:14:52.933,We just sold all 17 copies of your CD.
00:14:52.975,00:14:55.061,I didn't even have to show any of them my bosoms.
00:14:56.979,00:14:59.023,"Doodle honey, you go get yourself a Sanka."
00:14:59.065,00:15:00.024,Yeah.
00:15:00.066,00:15:01.359,"Thanks, Mom."
00:15:01.401,00:15:02.360,Good job.
00:15:07.240,00:15:08.949,I bought one for my grandson.
00:15:08.991,00:15:12.161,So he can hear for himself how good his old man was.
00:15:12.203,00:15:14.205,Ah.
00:15:14.247,00:15:16.416,"Shue, that was an amazing performance."
00:15:16.457,00:15:17.625,"Oh, thank you."
00:15:17.667,00:15:19.960,"I mean, we're just starting out, so..."
00:15:20.002,00:15:25.633,"Look, there's a PTA meeting next Thursday night and I want Acafellas to be the main event."
00:15:25.675,00:15:27.009,I need those parents happy.
00:15:27.051,00:15:30.930,They found out we've been serving their children prison food.
00:15:33.015,00:15:34.392,WILL: Uh-huh.
00:15:36.603,00:15:38.563,"Great job, son."
00:15:39.814,00:15:42.859,Well... Is it too soon to call Will Schuester the next Michael Buble?
00:15:42.901,00:15:46.404,The audience last Thursday at Benchwarmers Sports Bar didn't think so.
00:15:46.446,00:15:53.912,And Ken Tanaka's smoky baritone is like a cool fog that sweeps over a deep ocean of emotional intensity.
00:15:53.953,00:16:02.002,A big thumbs-up to Henri St. Pierre who proves you don't need all ten fingers to pluck a lady's heartstrings like a well-tuned sexy harpsichord.
00:16:02.044,00:16:03.504,Only Howard...
00:16:03.546,00:16:05.423,"Uh, sorry, Howard."
00:16:05.465,00:16:07.383,They didn't say anything about you.
00:16:07.425,00:16:09.385,"Buckle up, Ohio."
00:16:09.427,00:16:12.012,Are you ready for a new musical sensation?
00:16:12.054,00:16:15.266,"You'd better be, because here come the Acafellas."
00:16:15.308,00:16:16.476,Yeah!
00:16:16.517,00:16:21.481,"Oh, congratulations on your dead tree valentine, gentlemen."
00:16:21.522,00:16:23.399,"By the way, I want in."
00:16:23.441,00:16:26.193,"Stop right there, William."
00:16:26.235,00:16:28.112,I've got two words for you.
00:16:28.154,00:16:30.865,Josh Groban.
00:16:30.907,00:16:33.326,He's coming to the PTA event.
00:16:33.367,00:16:35.035,Who is Josh Groban?
00:16:35.077,00:16:36.496,Who is Josh Groban?!
00:16:36.537,00:16:37.997,Kill yourself!
00:16:40.917,00:16:46.046,He is an angel sent from heaven to deliver platinum records unto us.
00:16:46.088,00:16:50.217,"And if he were here right now, I would club you to death with his Critics' Choice award."
00:16:50.259,00:16:51.928,Why would he come to our show?
00:16:51.970,00:16:54.263,Because I invited him.
00:16:55.389,00:17:01.061,Josh and I have become frequent pen pals since he accidentally friended me on MySpace.
00:17:01.103,00:17:06.150,"And being my close personal confidant, he is only interested if I am in the group."
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.989,"No, Sandy."
00:17:11.030,00:17:13.574,We have standards.
00:17:15.368,00:17:17.745,"Okay, fine."
00:17:17.787,00:17:21.541,"But just so you know, the blogs are all atwitter."
00:17:21.582,00:17:25.545,They say he's looking for an opening act.
00:17:34.387,00:17:36.514,"Damn, Kurt, this car is fly."
00:17:36.556,00:17:43.187,My dad got it for my sweet 16 after I swore to stop wearing formfitting sweaters that stop at the knee.
00:17:43.229,00:17:45.147,What he doesn't know doesn't hurt him.
00:17:45.189,00:17:48.275,Are we even sure they're rehearsing today?
00:17:48.317,00:17:52.238,Vocal Adrenaline rehearses every day from 2:30 until midnight.
00:17:54.991,00:17:58.411,I'm just so nervous these Vocal Adrenaline kids are gonna laugh at us.
00:17:58.452,00:18:03.374,"They're so cool and popular, and we look like we just stepped off the short bus."
00:18:03.416,00:18:06.502,Those sweaty Nazis have just had more time to practice.
00:18:06.544,00:18:08.128,We have more heart.
00:18:08.170,00:18:09.505,And you don't look touched in the head.
00:18:09.547,00:18:11.549,That outfit is amazing.
00:18:13.384,00:18:17.137,"So, would you ever, you know, want to hang out?"
00:18:17.179,00:18:19.139,KURT: Come over. It's Liza Minnelli week on AMC!
00:18:19.181,00:18:20.140,Guys!
00:18:20.182,00:18:21.935,That's Andrea Cohen.
00:18:20.182,00:18:23.937,She won outstanding soloist last year at Absolutely Tampastic.
00:18:23.978,00:18:27.941,You can't leave rehearsals for any reason.
00:18:27.982,00:18:30.359,That includes heat exhaustion or Crohn's disease.
00:18:30.401,00:18:31.986,Are you guys Vocal Adrenaline?
00:18:32.028,00:18:35.155,We'd like to talk to Dakota Stanley about choreography for our Glee Club.
00:18:35.197,00:18:38.076,Don't!
00:18:38.117,00:18:40.036,He's a monster.
00:19:44.684,00:19:46.560,Get off my stage!
00:19:49.271,00:19:51.231,RACHEL: Mr. Stanley!
00:19:51.273,00:19:52.650,We're the McKinley High Glee Club.
00:19:52.692,00:19:53.901,DAKOTA: No interviews.
00:19:53.943,00:19:55.235,We'd like you to choreograph for us.
00:19:55.277,00:20:01.241,"Look, my fee is $8,000 per number, plus a $10,000 bonus if you place in the top three."
00:20:01.283,00:20:04.453,"And with Dakota Stanley at the wheel, you will place at the top three."
00:20:04.495,00:20:05.621,Move it.
00:20:09.167,00:20:12.336,"How are we going to get $8,000?"
00:20:20.094,00:20:21.554,Kick that way and back.
00:20:21.595,00:20:24.348,You kick out...
00:20:24.390,00:20:25.265,"Okay, one more."
00:20:25.307,00:20:26.559,Okay.
00:20:26.600,00:20:28.268,Kick out.
00:20:28.310,00:20:29.269,Right behind you.
00:20:29.311,00:20:30.270,It's all right.
00:20:30.312,00:20:32.106,Where is everybody?
00:20:32.148,00:20:34.274,Sandy went to get Henri from wood shop.
00:20:34.316,00:20:35.902,"And, oh, there's Howard."
00:20:37.319,00:20:39.197,I don't think I can be in the band anymore.
00:20:39.238,00:20:40.990,What?!
00:20:41.032,00:20:43.283,I'm doing inventory.
00:20:43.325,00:20:45.327,It was never my dream.
00:20:47.329,00:20:49.289,What?
00:20:49.331,00:20:51.291,Howard's out.
00:20:51.333,00:20:52.292,"Oh, that-that's just great."
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.293,What's he...
00:20:53.335,00:20:56.338,Hey. Emma.
00:20:56.380,00:21:00.218,"You didn't, uh, see me dancing earlier, did you?"
00:21:01.177,00:21:04.097,"Look, I have some bad news."
00:21:04.138,00:21:05.139,You're breaking up with me.
00:21:06.348,00:21:08.101,"What, here?"
00:21:08.142,00:21:10.310,"No, look, please stop talking."
00:21:10.352,00:21:15.315,"Um, no, look, I think the Acafellas pressure has proven to be a little bit too much for Henri."
00:21:15.357,00:21:16.400,"Really, why?"
00:21:16.442,00:21:20.362,"Well, he just downed six bottles of cough syrup, which is a lot, even for him."
00:21:20.404,00:21:21.822,"Um, he's okay."
00:21:21.864,00:21:28.955,"Sandy's in the emergency room with him now, but Figgins is insisting before he comes back, and can be around kids again, that he goes to rehab."
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.706,So that's where he's going tomorrow morning.
00:21:30.748,00:21:32.917,That's just great.
00:21:32.959,00:21:34.961,So Acafellas is officially doomed now.
00:21:36.295,00:21:40.216,"You know, uh, when I get stressed, I, I work out."
00:21:40.258,00:21:41.341,You can probably tell.
00:21:41.383,00:21:45.345,"So I'm gonna, uh, down some power bars, knock off a few reps."
00:21:45.387,00:21:46.555,Come up with some solutions here.
00:21:52.853,00:21:55.148,It was fun while it lasted.
00:21:55.189,00:21:57.357,"I don't think you should give up so easy, Will."
00:21:58.442,00:22:05.324,"You know, they said Van Halen was dead after David Lee Roth quit, but my worn-out single of Right Now says that they were wrong."
00:22:13.415,00:22:15.584,"You got a sec, Mr. Shue?"
00:22:16.919,00:22:18.378,"Yeah, of course. What's up?"
00:22:18.420,00:22:20.380,"I just want to tell you that I'm quitting Glee, too."
00:22:20.422,00:22:23.301,I didn't quit Glee.
00:22:23.342,00:22:25.261,"Well, you might as well have."
00:22:25.303,00:22:27.096,It's nutty in there.
00:22:27.138,00:22:30.766,"I try and talk sense into Rachel, but she's gone all chick-batty."
00:22:30.808,00:22:33.019,I gotta be honest with you.
00:22:33.060,00:22:38.398,It's hard being the quarterback when I get in the huddle and all the guys are calling me Deep Throat.
00:22:38.440,00:22:40.234,"Glee's bringing down my rep, man."
00:22:42.444,00:22:44.989,Have the guts to stick with it a little bit longer.
00:22:45.031,00:22:48.408,"You are a gifted performer, Finn."
00:22:48.450,00:22:51.495,"If you do, you're just gonna regret it for the rest of your life."
00:22:53.039,00:22:54.915,Trust me. I know.
00:22:56.458,00:22:58.376,It's just not fun anymore.
00:23:02.464,00:23:04.342,"Hey, Finn, wait."
00:23:05.343,00:23:08.304,There's something I want to talk to you about.
00:23:09.471,00:23:10.430,"Hey, Coach."
00:23:10.472,00:23:11.431,"What do you want, Puckerman?"
00:23:11.473,00:23:15.435,I hear there's a vacancy in your a capella group.
00:23:15.477,00:23:17.897,I want to offer my services.
00:23:19.565,00:23:21.441,I play guitar.
00:23:21.483,00:23:24.278,"And actually, I'm a really good singer."
00:23:25.487,00:23:27.614,"There are a lot of moms at your gigs, right?"
00:23:33.537,00:23:39.252,"I've got star potential, and more specifically, I'm tired of wasting my time with high school girls."
00:23:40.502,00:23:42.255,You're breaking up with me? Why?
00:23:42.296,00:23:44.131,Your credit score is terrible.
00:23:44.173,00:23:47.676,What I need as a woman is financial security.
00:23:47.718,00:23:51.097,"PUCK: See, young girls will shoot you down and make you feel terrible about yourself..."
00:23:51.138,00:23:54.350,but a cougar never disappoints.
00:23:55.726,00:23:57.477,"Thanks, Mrs. H."
00:23:57.519,00:23:59.397,Is that a nipple ring?
00:23:57.519,00:24:01.481,"Yeah, I'm kinda rock and roll."
00:24:01.523,00:24:05.443,I need your help unclogging my bathtub drain.
00:24:08.155,00:24:11.117,PUCK: The proof was in the sexual pudding.
00:24:11.158,00:24:17.748,My above-ground pool cleaning business went through the roof once I embraced my gift for music and gave these fine ladies the romance they were missing.
00:24:17.790,00:24:20.000,I also stopped beating people up so much.
00:24:20.042,00:24:23.337,When do we start rehearsals?
00:24:25.547,00:24:30.510,My love life is hanging by a thread and that thread is Acafellas.
00:24:30.552,00:24:32.679,It drives my girlfriend nuts in the pants.
00:24:32.721,00:24:40.354,"So if you screw this up for me, I swear to you I will stick my fist so far down your throat, you will taste my armpit hairs."
00:24:40.396,00:24:43.149,Do I make myself clear?
00:24:43.190,00:24:44.524,Good.
00:24:44.566,00:24:47.820,We rehearse Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:00.
00:24:47.861,00:24:49.405,Don't be late.
00:24:55.244,00:24:58.164,Do that.
00:24:58.205,00:24:59.206,"Okay, come on."
00:25:04.462,00:25:05.545,"Dude, my bowels have better moves than you."
00:25:05.587,00:25:07.547,"Guys, stop."
00:25:07.589,00:25:08.757,You guys got the steps down.
00:25:08.799,00:25:11.927,"You just need to relax, okay?"
00:25:11.969,00:25:15.139,"Um, you guys play baseball, right?"
00:25:15.181,00:25:16.849,What does your coach tell you about hitting?
00:25:16.890,00:25:18.476,"If you charge the pitcher, bring the bat."
00:25:18.516,00:25:23.022,"Okay, um, but I'm sure he also tells you to relax, right?"
00:25:23.063,00:25:25.024,"'Cause hitting's all about the hips, right?"
00:25:25.065,00:25:26.984,You gotta loosen them up.
00:25:27.026,00:25:28.402,Just swing that bat.
00:25:28.444,00:25:31.571,"All right, pretend, Acafellas, Madison Square Garden."
00:25:31.613,00:25:34.033,Here we are. All those beautiful ladies out there.
00:25:34.074,00:25:35.868,You swing that big ol' bat. Bam!
00:25:35.909,00:25:37.870,"Hit some home runs, all right, guys?"
00:25:40.289,00:25:43.209,"Now let's try it from the top, okay?"
00:25:43.250,00:25:44.418,Here we go.
00:25:46.628,00:25:50.132,"Five, six, seven, eight."
00:25:51.425,00:25:53.010,Yeah.
00:25:58.640,00:26:00.600,"Aw, yeah."
00:26:00.642,00:26:02.478,"Yeah, get those hips into it."
00:26:02.520,00:26:06.065,That's it! That's it!
00:26:06.106,00:26:07.316,Uh!
00:26:08.650,00:26:10.319,"That baseball thing sure was good, Mr. Shue."
00:26:10.361,00:26:13.489,Totally.
00:26:16.367,00:26:18.827,We need to have a gayvention.
00:26:18.869,00:26:20.246,That's a gay intervention.
00:26:20.287,00:26:22.122,TINA: It's K-K-Kurt.
00:26:22.164,00:26:23.790,He's lady fabulous.
00:26:23.832,00:26:25.625,It's obvious you like him.
00:26:25.667,00:26:30.464,We just don't want you to get hurt by feelings he can't reciprocate.
00:26:30.506,00:26:34.801,"Look, just because he wears nice clothes doesn't mean he's on the down-low."
00:26:34.843,00:26:37.221,He wore a corset to second period today.
00:26:37.263,00:26:40.015,"You can do better, Mercedes."
00:26:40.057,00:26:42.684,Really?
00:26:42.726,00:26:46.313,There's not a lot of guys around here knocking down my door for a date.
00:26:46.355,00:26:48.941,"Or yours, for that matter."
00:26:48.982,00:26:51.818,Nobody notices us. Hello?
00:26:51.860,00:26:53.695,We're in Glee Club.
00:26:53.737,00:26:55.864,And I'm tired of being lonely.
00:26:55.906,00:26:58.284,But Kurt...
00:26:58.325,00:27:03.330,"Kurt is sweet to me, and he likes who I am, and I like how I feel when I'm with him."
00:27:03.372,00:27:06.666,"And he's in our group, he understands what I'm going through."
00:27:06.708,00:27:11.505,"Now, maybe that's not enough for you guys, but it's enough for me."
00:27:24.726,00:27:26.520,"EMMA: You know what, Sue?"
00:27:24.726,00:27:28.105,"I got to say, I really misjudged you."
00:27:28.147,00:27:34.403,Getting the Cheerios to help out with the Glee Club choreographer fund-raiser is one of the nicest things I've ever seen.
00:27:34.445,00:27:39.199,"Well, Erma, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this Glee Club successful."
00:27:39.241,00:27:40.493,MAN: Come on!
00:27:40.534,00:27:41.659,Ooh! So excited.
00:27:41.701,00:27:43.703,"Oh, I love a car wash, too, though, you know."
00:27:43.745,00:27:50.294,"When I was little, if I got all As, my dad would let me wash his car, so I'd get my little toothbrush out, and I'd clean it all weekend long."
00:27:50.336,00:27:53.713,"You know, the way you use your mental illness to help these kids is really inspiring."
00:27:53.755,00:27:55.382,I'm shocked you're not married.
00:28:00.554,00:28:01.805,Your rims are clean.
00:28:01.847,00:28:03.807,"We've polished them, like, three times already."
00:28:03.849,00:28:05.434,Did you bring a change of clothes?
00:28:05.476,00:28:07.727,Because we're going straight to sing-along Sound of Music.
00:28:07.769,00:28:11.023,"So, listen, Kurt, this is like the third time we've gone out."
00:28:11.064,00:28:12.441,Can we just make it official?
00:28:12.483,00:28:14.568,Make what official?
00:28:14.610,00:28:16.736,"You know, that we're dating."
00:28:16.778,00:28:20.698,"I'm sorry, Mercedes, but I thought I made it very clear."
00:28:22.075,00:28:24.161,I'm in love with someone else.
00:28:29.416,00:28:31.669,Rachel?
00:28:32.628,00:28:34.630,Yes.
00:28:34.672,00:28:37.257,For several years now.
00:30:34.500,00:30:36.168,KURT: You busted my window.
00:30:36.209,00:30:38.962,How could you do that?
00:30:39.004,00:30:41.173,"Well, you busted my heart."
00:30:41.214,00:30:43.216,Hm!
00:30:57.939,00:31:00.900,"Okay, please examine your personalized menus."
00:31:00.942,00:31:04.780,This is what you're going to be eating for the next six months.
00:31:04.822,00:31:06.114,"Um, mine just says coffee."
00:31:06.156,00:31:07.907,Mm-hmm.
00:31:07.949,00:31:09.159,What's smelt?
00:31:07.949,00:31:10.786,DAKOTA: A pungent low-carb freshwater fish.
00:31:10.828,00:31:12.078,"Okay, let's start with today's business."
00:31:12.120,00:31:13.372,"Artie, you're cut."
00:31:12.120,00:31:15.290,You're not trying hard enough.
00:31:15.332,00:31:18.544,At walking. We can't be wheeling you around during every number.
00:31:18.585,00:31:21.921,"It throws off the whole dynamic, and it's depressing."
00:31:21.963,00:31:23.131,"So, you're kicking him out?"
00:31:23.173,00:31:25.133,Mm-hmm.
00:31:25.175,00:31:27.010,"Youse got to go, Effie."
00:31:27.052,00:31:28.928,"No, no, no. Yeah."
00:31:27.052,00:31:30.347,KURT: You can't kick people out of Glee Club because you don't like the way they look.
00:31:30.389,00:31:35.935,"Uh, why don't you shut your face-gash and stay away from aerosol cans because you could burst into flames at any second?"
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.396,You three-- you're great.
00:31:37.437,00:31:38.814,Seriously. Don't change a thing.
00:31:38.856,00:31:40.733,"Uh, you-- ew, nose job."
00:31:40.774,00:31:41.941,Now just hold on a second.
00:31:41.983,00:31:43.569,"What was that, Frankenteen?"
00:31:43.610,00:31:48.948,"Why don't you, uh, wipe that dopey look off your face and get some lotion for those knuckles you've been dragging on the ground?"
00:31:48.990,00:31:49.949,What's wrong with me?
00:31:49.991,00:31:52.369,What's wrong with me is that you're freakishly tall.
00:31:52.411,00:31:55.455,I feel like a woodland creature.
00:31:55.497,00:31:57.833,"Um, am I hurting your feelings?"
00:31:57.875,00:31:59.459,Did I say something wrong?
00:31:59.501,00:32:03.963,Because I thought you wanted somebody who respected you enough to tell you the truth.
00:32:04.005,00:32:07.008,"But maybe you don't have the confidence to hear it, hmm?"
00:32:07.050,00:32:13.181,"Maybe you need somebody who's going to lie to you and tell you things like, You got what it takes."
00:32:13.223,00:32:14.266,But you know what?
00:32:14.307,00:32:16.435,"As far as I can see, you don't."
00:32:16.476,00:32:24.067,"So, why don't you just take a little second, take a breather, and ask yourself, Do I want to be a winner..."
00:32:25.318,00:32:26.403,...or not?
00:32:26.445,00:32:28.363,Screw this.
00:32:28.405,00:32:29.281,I quit.
00:32:29.322,00:32:30.574,"MERCEDES: Me, t-t-t-too."
00:32:30.616,00:32:31.991,"Let's roll, Artie."
00:32:32.033,00:32:33.993,"No. Great, great."
00:32:32.033,00:32:35.995,"You know, separate the wheat from the chaff; that's perfect."
00:32:36.037,00:32:37.497,Wait.
00:32:39.207,00:32:41.000,Barbra Streisand.
00:32:42.335,00:32:46.799,"When Barbra was a young ingÃ©nue, everyone told her in order to be a star, she'd have to get a nose job."
00:32:46.840,00:32:48.383,"Thankfully, she refused."
00:32:48.425,00:32:50.009,"Where's this going, Yentl?"
00:32:50.051,00:32:51.052,Where it's going is that...
00:32:52.429,00:32:55.307,We don't need you.
00:32:55.348,00:32:57.016,Let's face it.
00:32:57.058,00:32:59.352,We're never going to be as good of dancers as Vocal Adrenaline.
00:33:00.771,00:33:04.274,We're gonna win because... we're different.
00:33:05.525,00:33:06.944,And that's what makes us special.
00:33:06.985,00:33:10.029,They told J.Lo her booty was too big.
00:33:10.071,00:33:13.408,Curtis Mayfield was more successful after he became paralyzed.
00:33:13.450,00:33:15.201,Jim Abbott.
00:33:15.243,00:33:17.287,I have no idea who that is.
00:33:17.329,00:33:19.832,He was a one-armed pitcher for the Yankees.
00:33:19.873,00:33:21.333,Pitched a no-hitter.
00:33:21.374,00:33:22.960,"Okay, so, yeah."
00:33:23.001,00:33:26.421,"Misfits and spaz-heads and cripples can make it, too."
00:33:26.463,00:33:27.714,That's great.
00:33:27.756,00:33:30.049,Our point is that...
00:33:30.091,00:33:31.384,you're fired.
00:33:33.094,00:33:35.013,And I'm taller than you.
00:33:37.015,00:33:39.017,Barely.
00:33:41.019,00:33:43.355,"Wait, we have to wear mascara?"
00:33:43.396,00:33:46.065,Sandy says it makes our eyes pop.
00:33:48.986,00:33:50.696,"There's a lot of moms out there, right?"
00:33:50.737,00:33:52.489,"Guys, don't worry about it."
00:33:52.531,00:33:53.949,"Just get in the zone, all right?"
00:33:53.991,00:33:55.325,This is going to be fun.
00:33:55.367,00:33:58.370,You're going to remember this night for the rest of your lives.
00:33:58.411,00:34:00.664,Mr. Shue...
00:34:00.706,00:34:03.375,"No, that isn't what I wanted to tell you."
00:34:03.416,00:34:05.794,It's just... thanks.
00:34:05.836,00:34:07.587,For believing in me.
00:34:10.215,00:34:12.258,SANDY: He's here! He's here!
00:34:12.300,00:34:14.093,Josh Groban is here!
00:34:14.135,00:34:16.262,"Front row, big brown eyes, cute as a buttermilk biscuit."
00:34:16.304,00:34:17.723,I barfed.
00:34:17.764,00:34:19.098,He actually showed up?
00:34:19.140,00:34:24.103,"Gentlemen, forget every experience you have ever had in your drab little lives."
00:34:24.145,00:34:27.983,This is the most important thing you will ever do.
00:34:28.025,00:34:30.068,Places!
00:34:31.361,00:34:33.989,Stop!
00:34:34.031,00:34:36.157,Stop!
00:34:39.452,00:34:41.621,I know you're not gonna sing that song!
00:34:47.586,00:34:50.505,I know you're not gonna sing that song!
00:35:54.319,00:35:57.447,I know you're not gonna sing that song!
00:36:21.721,00:36:27.102,I would like to just go into the recording studio and lay some of those tracks down.
00:36:27.144,00:36:29.395,And of course I would love to play some bigger venues.
00:36:29.437,00:36:32.273,"Wembley Stadium, Red Rocks..."
00:36:33.274,00:36:36.486,"Hey, guys, I'm Josh Groban."
00:36:36.528,00:36:38.488,"This is my bodyguard, Flex."
00:36:38.530,00:36:40.032,We were in town.
00:36:40.073,00:36:44.161,"I was inducting Run-DMC into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last night, so I thought I'd stop by and say hello."
00:36:44.202,00:36:46.788,"So, which one of you is, uh... Sandy?"
00:36:48.165,00:36:49.499,Ooh!
00:36:49.541,00:36:54.253,"Mr. Groban, we are so honored that you came here today."
00:36:52.293,00:36:55.964,I came here to tell you...
00:36:56.006,00:36:57.256,Stop emailing me.
00:36:58.299,00:36:59.425,This is a restraining order.
00:36:59.467,00:37:01.553,Stop sending me nude photos.
00:37:01.594,00:37:03.847,Stop calling me. I don't know how you got my number!
00:37:03.889,00:37:12.271,"I don't know how you got my number again after I changed it, but I don't want any more of your edible gift baskets or locks of your hair and I don't want to read any more of those sonnets you wrote for me."
00:37:12.313,00:37:13.481,"That stuff got crazy, dude."
00:37:13.523,00:37:15.233,JOSH: Are we clear?
00:37:16.609,00:37:17.569,"Thank you, gentlemen."
00:37:17.610,00:37:20.739,"And by the way, great show."
00:37:20.780,00:37:24.576,"I mean, like, Explosive."
00:37:24.617,00:37:25.785,Thanks.
00:37:25.827,00:37:27.120,Sorry.
00:37:39.716,00:37:41.927,"TERRI: I'm sorry, Will."
00:37:41.968,00:37:45.555,I... I could have been more supportive.
00:37:47.599,00:37:49.559,You guys were actually pretty good.
00:37:51.519,00:37:53.271,And you were good.
00:37:54.564,00:37:56.357,You were really good.
00:37:56.399,00:37:58.317,Yeah?
00:37:58.359,00:38:00.195,Yeah.
00:38:09.079,00:38:11.248,Don't bother.
00:38:11.289,00:38:12.415,"Hey, kids."
00:38:12.457,00:38:13.374,Have you seen Doodle?
00:38:13.416,00:38:19.172,"Now, you might be thinking, why would a pop star like me come over here and talk to you?"
00:38:19.214,00:38:21.133,"Well, let me tell you something."
00:38:21.174,00:38:23.802,Throngs of screaming teenagers don't do it for Josh Groban.
00:38:23.843,00:38:25.220,No.
00:38:25.262,00:38:26.345,Josh Groban loves a blowsy alcoholic.
00:38:26.387,00:38:28.181,"Oh, wow."
00:38:28.223,00:38:29.599,"You'll have to forgive me, ma'am."
00:38:29.641,00:38:33.603,"I'm a little bit drunk, and I'm afraid I'm not making good choices right now."
00:38:35.105,00:38:37.356,Maybe she slipped and hit her head again.
00:38:39.985,00:38:43.655,You guys kicked some serious tail up there tonight.
00:38:43.696,00:38:45.364,Sorry about the whole Josh Groban thing.
00:38:45.406,00:38:47.284,"Nah, it's all right."
00:38:47.325,00:38:48.660,How are the other guys taking it?
00:38:48.701,00:38:54.582,That Ryerson guy cried himself to sleep in Figgins' arms and Ken Tanaka is raiding the nacho bar.
00:38:54.624,00:38:57.085,What about you?
00:38:57.127,00:38:58.377,You okay?
00:38:58.419,00:39:02.381,"You know, Dad... I am."
00:39:02.423,00:39:07.553,"I mean, this was all a dream come true, but... I'm a teacher."
00:39:07.595,00:39:10.556,And a really good one.
00:39:10.598,00:39:12.391,That's enough for me.
00:39:12.433,00:39:13.392,I know.
00:39:13.434,00:39:16.813,I saw the way your students look at you.
00:39:16.855,00:39:18.356,You inspire people.
00:39:20.150,00:39:21.484,You inspired me.
00:39:21.526,00:39:23.402,What do you mean?
00:39:25.446,00:39:31.995,"Night classes for now, until I get all of my prerequisites, but I registered yesterday."
00:39:32.037,00:39:36.124,You made me realize it's never too late too grow a pair and go after your dream.
00:39:36.166,00:39:37.416,"That's amazing, Dad."
00:39:37.458,00:39:39.377,That's so amazing!
00:39:43.506,00:39:45.300,"Hey, Kurt."
00:39:47.177,00:39:52.640,I just wanted to say I'm really sorry I did that to your car.
00:39:52.682,00:39:54.433,I'll pay for it to get fixed.
00:39:54.475,00:39:56.228,It's okay.
00:39:56.269,00:40:00.439,My dad took my baby away after he found my tiara collection in my hope chest.
00:40:00.481,00:40:04.443,And I just wanted to say I hope it works out between you and Rachel.
00:40:04.485,00:40:08.406,"You'll have really cute, loud babies."
00:40:10.950,00:40:12.451,Mercedes...
00:40:15.372,00:40:17.498,I lied to you.
00:40:18.499,00:40:21.336,I don't like Rachel.
00:40:25.506,00:40:27.092,I'm gay.
00:40:27.133,00:40:30.469,Why didn't you just tell me?
00:40:30.511,00:40:33.472,Because I've never told anyone before.
00:40:33.514,00:40:36.935,"You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are, Kurt."
00:40:36.976,00:40:42.523,"You should just tell people, especially the kids in Glee."
00:40:42.565,00:40:48.487,"The whole point of the club is about expressing what's really inside you, remember?"
00:40:48.529,00:40:51.950,I can't.
00:40:51.991,00:40:54.452,"I'm just not that confident, I guess."
00:41:02.127,00:41:03.586,Let me get this straight.
00:41:04.796,00:41:12.971,"The Glee Club got rid of Dakota Stanley; Mr. Schuester is back; and they're busy at work on a new number, more confident than ever."
00:41:13.012,00:41:16.515,"WILL: And down... clap, and up, clap, clap."
00:41:16.557,00:41:19.102,"Down, clap, and up, clap, clap."
00:41:19.144,00:41:21.520,"This is what we call a total disaster, ladies."
00:41:21.562,00:41:23.564,I'm going to ask you to smell your armpits.
00:41:27.944,00:41:29.528,That's the smell of failure.
00:41:29.570,00:41:31.781,And it's stinking up my office.
00:41:35.576,00:41:38.830,I'm revoking your tanning privileges for the rest of the semester.
00:41:38.871,00:41:42.541,"Oh, no!"
00:41:46.587,00:41:50.133,"Ms. Sylvester, I want to thank you."
00:41:50.175,00:41:51.384,For what?
00:41:51.426,00:41:53.594,For teaching me a valuable life lesson.
00:41:54.679,00:42:01.060,"When you really believe in yourself, you don't have to bring other people down."
00:42:05.606,00:42:08.609,"WILL: Uh, uh, step, ball change and head."
00:42:08.651,00:42:09.610,"Step, ball change and head."
00:42:09.652,00:42:12.489,Low and up.
00:42:12.530,00:42:15.074,Low and high!
00:42:15.116,00:42:16.575,"Oh, what do you guys think?"
00:42:16.617,00:42:17.994,Mr. Schuester?
00:42:18.036,00:42:20.579,"Yes, Rachel?"
00:42:20.621,00:42:23.582,It was really good.
00:42:27.628,00:42:28.587,WILL: Thank you. Thank you.
00:42:28.629,00:42:29.630,Okay.
00:42:29.672,00:42:30.673,From the top!
00:00:57.766,00:00:59.393,Dad...
00:00:59.434,00:01:00.769,You're home early.
00:01:00.811,00:01:03.104,Deadliest Catch is on.
00:01:06.775,00:01:07.985,What are you wearing?
00:01:08.027,00:01:09.945,It's a unitard.
00:01:09.987,00:01:12.155,"Guys wear them to, uh, work out nowadays."
00:01:12.197,00:01:14.115,Do sports.
00:01:14.157,00:01:16.410,They wick sweat from the body.
00:01:18.245,00:01:19.496,F-football.
00:01:19.538,00:01:22.207,"Yeah, all the guys in football wear them."
00:01:22.249,00:01:23.834,They're jock-chic.
00:01:24.877,00:01:26.545,Totally. Kurt's on the football team now.
00:01:27.629,00:01:28.756,He's the kicker.
00:01:28.797,00:01:30.089,"That's the smallest guy on the field, right?"
00:01:31.174,00:01:35.971,"Yeah. Yeah, Brit and Tina were just helping me with some conditioning work."
00:01:36.013,00:01:39.058,Hmm. Really?
00:01:39.098,00:01:45.022,"You know, I played in JC, before I busted up my knee popping wheelies on my dirt bike."
00:01:46.481,00:01:48.233,"I guess we'll have something to talk about, then."
00:01:50.485,00:01:52.487,So one of you two his girlfriend?
00:01:55.198,00:01:58.159,But I'm not ready to be exclusive just yet.
00:01:58.201,00:01:59.620,Hmm.
00:02:03.290,00:02:06.543,I can't hear myself think up there.
00:02:06.585,00:02:08.587,"Hey, Kurt?"
00:02:08.629,00:02:12.091,Be sure to get me a ticket to your first game.
00:02:28.065,00:02:29.775,"You're doing great, baby."
00:02:29.817,00:02:31.986,"KENDRA: No, no, no."
00:02:33.445,00:02:36.698,Giving birth is not like how it is in the movies.
00:02:36.740,00:02:39.200,It is bloody and bestial.
00:02:41.244,00:02:42.704,"Well, I'm just trying to be supportive."
00:02:43.872,00:02:44.915,"I'm sorry, Kendra."
00:02:44.957,00:02:46.207,When was I making it about me?
00:02:48.085,00:02:49.252,"You have to be liked, Will."
00:02:49.294,00:02:53.132,"You're nice and supportive, and you avoid conflict."
00:02:53.172,00:02:59.805,Your wife is going to be pushing a watermelon out of her boy-howdy in five months.
00:02:59.847,00:03:01.222,She doesn't need nice.
00:03:01.264,00:03:02.390,She needs Dolomite.
00:03:03.558,00:03:05.226,"Of course you can, sweetie."
00:03:06.269,00:03:13.401,"Okay, why don't you come on down here, I'm going to show you how to rub the gas bubbles out of your wife's stomach."
00:03:13.443,00:03:15.154,"Oh, no, wait!"
00:03:15.194,00:03:17.238,"You'll like it. Phil still does it to me, feels great."
00:03:17.280,00:03:19.240,I don't want him touching my stomach.
00:03:19.282,00:03:21.035,"I mean, maybe he would bruise the baby."
00:03:21.076,00:03:22.243,Oh.
00:03:27.290,00:03:29.250,"Sure, uh, I'm..."
00:03:29.292,00:03:31.045,"It's going to take a few minutes, though."
00:03:31.086,00:03:32.921,That's okay.
00:03:32.963,00:03:34.131,Be right back.
00:03:34.173,00:03:37.258,"Make me one, too, but hold the tomato."
00:03:37.300,00:03:38.301,WILL: Okay.
00:03:38.343,00:03:39.344,And the lettuce.
00:03:39.386,00:03:40.554,I can't do this.
00:03:40.595,00:03:42.097,"Oh, honey, don't worry about it."
00:03:42.139,00:03:43.348,You're going to have an epidural.
00:03:43.390,00:03:47.268,I'm just making it sound worse than it is to make him feel guilty.
00:03:47.310,00:03:50.981,And then you have him by the balls for the rest of your life.
00:03:51.023,00:03:54.651,"Kendra, if I told you something, would you promise not to tell anybody, not even Phil?"
00:03:54.693,00:03:56.277,"Oh, my God."
00:03:56.319,00:03:58.113,Is the baby Black?
00:03:58.155,00:04:00.157,No.
00:04:05.245,00:04:07.330,The doctor said it's a hysterical pregnancy.
00:04:07.372,00:04:08.498,I can't tell Will.
00:04:08.540,00:04:10.125,I can't.
00:04:10.167,00:04:12.293,He already has one foot out the door.
00:04:12.335,00:04:13.795,This baby's the only reason he's still here.
00:04:13.837,00:04:16.506,What do you think he's going to do when he finds out you lied?
00:04:16.548,00:04:19.093,"Oh, God, I don't know."
00:04:19.134,00:04:20.594,I gotta tell him the truth.
00:04:22.804,00:04:24.514,Are you insane?!
00:04:24.556,00:04:27.308,Dishonesty is food to a marriage.
00:04:28.852,00:04:30.478,"Oh, Kendra..."
00:04:30.520,00:04:32.522,Stop being so emotional.
00:04:32.564,00:04:34.524,The solution is clear.
00:04:35.734,00:04:38.278,We're going to have to get you a baby.
00:04:57.005,00:04:58.840,"Hey, guys."
00:04:59.591,00:05:01.342,Hope I'm not intruding.
00:05:01.384,00:05:03.095,"No, not at all."
00:05:08.100,00:05:10.185,"Oh, um, so get this."
00:05:10.227,00:05:12.353,"You know how I'm kind of like a local news junkie, right?"
00:05:12.395,00:05:14.355,Isn't that kind of depressing?
00:05:14.397,00:05:16.608,"It's kind of like a, like a horror film, you know?"
00:05:16.650,00:05:20.570,"It's drug recalls and poison toys-- Africanized bees, that was terrible..."
00:05:20.612,00:05:24.950,"That's because disasters freak you out, yet fascinate you at the same time, sweetie."
00:05:24.992,00:05:28.453,"So you like the local news, because this way you can experience them from the safety of your condo."
00:05:30.872,00:05:33.167,"An-anyway, yeah."
00:05:33.208,00:05:39.298,"Um, they just finished this story on this zoo mauling, you know, and, um, you'll never guess who came on next."
00:05:39.338,00:05:47.264,"Well, let's see what's going on now with local champion cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in a brand-new segment we call Sue's Corner."
00:05:47.306,00:05:49.057,"Take it away, Sue."
00:05:49.099,00:05:51.392,"Thanks, Rod. Andrea."
00:05:51.434,00:05:56.397,"You know, caning has fallen out of fashion in the United States."
00:05:56.439,00:06:06.491,"But ask anyone who's safely walked the immaculate sidewalks of Singapore after winning an international cheerleading competition, and they'll tell you one thing."
00:06:06.533,00:06:08.994,Caning works.
00:06:09.036,00:06:12.914,And I think it's about time we did a little more of it right here.
00:06:12.956,00:06:26.427,"And to all those naysayers out there who say, That's illegal; you can't strike children on their bare buttocks with razor-sharp bamboo sticks, well, to them, I say, Yes, we cane."
00:06:30.140,00:06:32.100,They gave her a segment on the local news?
00:06:32.142,00:06:33.434,Mm-hmm.
00:06:33.476,00:06:40.275,"SUE: Well, because being a local celebrity who's been written up twice on the sports page of USA Today has its perks, William."
00:06:40.317,00:06:41.693,"Hey, pal, you want to pull that chair out for me?"
00:06:41.735,00:06:48.075,My hand's still sore from signing autographs down at the Donut Hole this morning.
00:06:48.116,00:06:49.450,Brought you some holes I couldn't finish.
00:06:49.492,00:06:54.039,"Oh, and, uh, FYI, the overnights were through the roof."
00:06:55.332,00:06:56.917,"You don't know what that means, do you, overnights?"
00:06:56.958,00:07:05.675,"Well, that's lingo for overnight ratings, which shows us leading among 18-to-49-year-olds, making WOHN western Ohio's number one local newscast."
00:07:05.717,00:07:06.927,Wow.
00:07:06.968,00:07:07.969,"Wow is the word, Alma."
00:07:09.346,00:07:10.972,"You know, I wasn't always in the spotlight."
00:07:11.014,00:07:17.062,"But I didn't want to end up stuck at a lousy high school, wrestling with mental illness."
00:07:17.104,00:07:23.693,"Or 40 and single, coaching the worst football team in the history of our state."
00:07:23.735,00:07:26.529,Or having to go to the salon every week to have my hair permed.
00:07:26.571,00:07:28.489,I didn't want to have to do that to myself.
00:07:28.531,00:07:34.454,"So, I sent out my resume, and I am so happy to tell you that I am busting out of my box."
00:07:35.580,00:07:39.209,"I'd love to stay and chat, but I got a satellite interview."
00:07:39.251,00:07:45.006,"That's lingo, again, for an interview via satellite."
00:07:56.559,00:07:58.519,"Excuse me, this isn't the right key."
00:07:58.561,00:08:00.188,"No, that's actually the right key."
00:08:00.230,00:08:01.522,This is the alto part.
00:08:01.564,00:08:04.151,Yep. Tina's doing the solo.
00:08:04.192,00:08:06.194,RACHEL: I-I'm sorry.
00:08:06.236,00:08:08.238,There must be some sort of mix-up.
00:08:08.280,00:08:10.991,I thought I made it very clear that anything from West Side Story goes to me.
00:08:11.032,00:08:13.034,Maria is my part.
00:08:13.076,00:08:15.620,"Natalie Wood was a Jew, you know."
00:08:15.662,00:08:18.957,"I've had a very deep, personal connection to this role since the age of one."
00:08:18.999,00:08:21.460,"Well, I'm trying to shake things up a bit, get us out of our boxes."
00:08:21.501,00:08:22.794,You're trying to punish me.
00:08:22.836,00:08:24.004,I think you're being irrational.
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.464,I think you're being unfair.
00:08:25.505,00:08:30.635,"I think you're being unfair to Tina, who might've been happy about getting her first solo."
00:08:30.677,00:08:37.392,"Tina knows how much I respect her, and I think she would agree with me that she's not ready for such an iconic role as Maria."
00:08:37.434,00:08:38.601,I'm a Jet?
00:08:47.319,00:08:50.405,"The more times she storms out of rehearsal, the less impact it has."
00:08:50.447,00:08:52.199,"Congratulations, Tina."
00:08:54.242,00:08:55.535,This is going well.
00:08:56.786,00:08:58.455,KURT: Finn?
00:08:59.622,00:09:01.249,I needed to ask you something.
00:08:59.622,00:09:03.084,"Thanks, but I already have a date to the prom."
00:09:03.126,00:09:04.419,But I'm flattered.
00:09:04.461,00:09:06.213,I know how important dances are to teen gays.
00:09:06.254,00:09:07.755,I'm not gay.
00:09:07.797,00:09:09.508,Oh.
00:09:09.549,00:09:10.591,I just...
00:09:10.633,00:09:12.635,I needed a favor.
00:09:18.850,00:09:21.353,"This is not that difficult, gentlemen, let's go."
00:09:30.653,00:09:31.905,"Just relax, okay?"
00:09:31.946,00:09:36.076,"Remember what I told you: keep your eye on the ball, don't try to aim it."
00:09:36.117,00:09:37.118,"Okay, put your helmet on."
00:09:37.160,00:09:38.619,It'll mess up my hair.
00:09:38.661,00:09:40.788,Put your...
00:09:40.830,00:09:43.624,God...
00:09:43.666,00:09:45.544,"Thank you for helping me with this, Finn."
00:09:45.585,00:09:46.961,You're really cool.
00:09:47.962,00:09:52.633,"Well, I figure, the more crossover between Glee and football, the easier my life's going to be."
00:09:52.675,00:09:54.802,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa, where are you going?"
00:09:54.844,00:09:56.930,To get my music ready.
00:09:56.971,00:09:58.639,But we did when we were rehearsing.
00:09:58.681,00:10:01.101,Practicing and no one was around.
00:10:01.142,00:10:04.229,"Look, do you know how much interference I had to run with these guys just to get you this tryout?"
00:10:04.271,00:10:06.689,"If you do it your way, they're going to kill you."
00:10:06.731,00:10:10.277,My body is like a rum chocolate soufflÃ©.
00:10:10.318,00:10:12.653,"If I don't warm it up right, it doesn't rise."
00:10:12.695,00:10:15.698,"If I'm doing this, I'm doing it my way."
00:10:17.492,00:10:20.661,"So are you two an item now, or...?"
00:10:20.703,00:10:22.163,He doesn't belong here.
00:10:22.205,00:10:24.040,You joined Acafellas.
00:10:24.082,00:10:25.584,"I'm a stud, dude."
00:10:25.625,00:10:28.295,"I can wear a dress to school, and people think it's cool."
00:10:29.003,00:10:30.713,KEN: Everybody take a knee.
00:10:30.755,00:10:33.133,Six games.
00:10:33.174,00:10:38.679,"Our kicker, Mr. Langanthal, is zero for 12 in field goal attempts."
00:10:38.721,00:10:43.518,"As most of you statistically-minded people know, that sucks!"
00:10:44.727,00:10:50.108,"So, Mr. Langanthal will thusly now be in charge of hydration services."
00:10:50.150,00:10:56.156,The next player that can get a football between those uprights will get his job.
00:10:56.197,00:10:59.909,"Hi. I'm Kurt Hummel, and I'll be auditioning for the role of kicker."
00:11:52.795,00:11:54.214,"That was good, right?"
00:11:54.255,00:11:55.756,Yeah. Yeah.
00:11:58.051,00:12:03.973,"Can you do that with a game on the line and ten gorillas bearing down on you who want nothing more than to taste your sweet, virgin blood?"
00:12:04.015,00:12:04.932,"Hmm, sounds like fun."
00:12:04.974,00:12:06.226,Can I have my music?
00:12:06.267,00:12:09.563,"You kick like that, you can wear a tutu, for all I care."
00:12:09.604,00:12:10.689,Gentlemen!
00:12:10.771,00:12:13.774,We have found ourselves a kicker!
00:12:21.032,00:12:22.200,"More mail for you, Sue."
00:12:22.242,00:12:25.203,But I think there might be some...
00:12:25.245,00:12:28.707,some hate mail mixed in from your editorial on littering.
00:12:28.747,00:12:32.793,"Well, Mr. McClung, your station didn't hire me because I was yella."
00:12:32.835,00:12:40.801,"Not everyone's going to have the walnuts to take a pro-littering stance, but I will not rest until every inch of our fair state is covered in garbage."
00:12:40.843,00:12:43.179,That's why I pay taxes.
00:12:43.221,00:12:49.018,"It keeps garbagemen earning a living, so they can afford tacos for their family."
00:12:49.060,00:12:51.396,Fantastic.
00:12:51.438,00:12:53.814,But I'm...
00:12:53.856,00:12:59.613,concerned about your future at WOHN.
00:12:59.654,00:13:01.822,"You see, my daughter goes to your school."
00:13:01.864,00:13:05.826,And she says that a lot of the top cheerleaders are defecting to the show choir.
00:13:07.120,00:13:12.292,"You know, it makes me wonder if you're, if you're losing all that talent how you could expect to win Nationals."
00:13:12.333,00:13:16.337,"See, your segment's all about being a champion, Sue, a winner."
00:13:16.379,00:13:19.798,So... we need you to win Nationals.
00:13:21.301,00:13:23.844,"Okay, uh... thanks a bunch."
00:13:25.054,00:13:26.805,Great work.
00:13:35.982,00:13:37.776,Quinn?
00:13:37.816,00:13:39.818,"Hey, what's with the silent treatment?"
00:13:41.988,00:13:45.158,"Whatever I did, I'm sorry."
00:13:45.199,00:13:46.743,I'm pregnant.
00:13:48.911,00:13:50.580,I wasn't sure and...
00:13:50.622,00:13:53.750,I really didn't want to go by myself.
00:13:53.792,00:13:55.669,I'm so sorry that I didn't tell you sooner.
00:13:55.710,00:13:57.796,Mine?
00:13:57.836,00:14:00.298,"Yes, you."
00:14:00.340,00:14:01.882,Who else's would it be?
00:14:01.924,00:14:04.135,But we-we never...
00:14:04.177,00:14:05.178,Last month.
00:14:05.219,00:14:06.513,Hot tub.
00:14:15.313,00:14:17.106,"Oh, no."
00:14:17.148,00:14:18.358,"Oh, no."
00:14:18.399,00:14:19.900,Oh...
00:14:19.942,00:14:21.402,Think of the mail.
00:14:21.444,00:14:22.779,Oh!
00:14:22.821,00:14:24.947,Oh! You killed him!
00:14:24.989,00:14:25.990,Oh...
00:14:26.032,00:14:27.742,But we were wearing our swimsuits.
00:14:27.784,00:14:30.911,Ask Jeeves said a hot tub is the perfect temperature for sperm.
00:14:30.953,00:14:33.164,It helps it swim faster.
00:14:33.206,00:14:34.915,"Oh, my God."
00:14:34.957,00:14:36.793,"Oh, my God, wait."
00:14:36.835,00:14:37.960,Are-Are you going to get a...?
00:14:41.840,00:14:44.592,I really thought I had a shot of getting out of here.
00:14:59.232,00:15:02.777,SANDY: I've been collecting since 1961.
00:15:03.862,00:15:06.197,Isn't this just lovely and normal?
00:15:07.448,00:15:08.867,They're my everything.
00:15:08.908,00:15:11.160,Teatime.
00:15:15.874,00:15:17.250,Right.
00:15:20.002,00:15:23.673,"Oh, I just thought I'd stop by and say hello, buddy."
00:15:23.715,00:15:29.970,"Boy, the only thing missing from this place is a couple dozen bodies lymed and rotting in shallow graves under the floorboards."
00:15:30.012,00:15:33.182,"Please, have a seat on the casting couch."
00:15:36.519,00:15:41.065,It is so wonderful to finally have some Sandy time.
00:15:41.107,00:15:43.984,I have my bridge game on Fridays.
00:15:44.026,00:15:48.448,"Saturdays, I am fully committed at the local cat rescue."
00:15:48.489,00:15:50.199,let's cut the crap.
00:15:53.035,00:15:55.204,I'm living in a cocoon of horror.
00:15:57.081,00:16:01.335,"Yesterday, I ate nine cans of aerosol whipped cream."
00:16:03.713,00:16:05.381,No...
00:16:05.423,00:16:09.260,"Sandy, Sandy... we have similar problems."
00:16:09.302,00:16:12.931,You need to be back in the spotlight.
00:16:12.972,00:16:17.017,I want to offer you the school's Arts Administrator position.
00:16:17.059,00:16:27.027,"You will have control of all the arts programs: music, art, drama-- wait for it-- Glee Club."
00:16:27.069,00:16:31.031,That's impossible.
00:16:31.073,00:16:33.033,"Oh, don't you worry about Figgins."
00:16:33.075,00:16:37.079,I'm never letting Sandy Ryerson back in this school.
00:16:37.121,00:16:39.165,Take a look at this.
00:16:43.085,00:17:04.440,"FIGGINS: Well, I would hate to think of this video circulating around the school."
00:17:04.482,00:17:06.693,"Better yet, YouTube."
00:17:08.277,00:17:11.071,Our first order of business is Glee Club.
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.072,Oh!
00:17:12.114,00:17:14.283,I couldn't agree with you more.
00:17:16.118,00:17:18.287,And there's one linchpin holding that group together.
00:17:18.329,00:17:20.331,Rachel Berry.
00:17:20.373,00:17:21.875,"Hold on to your Easter bonnet, Sandy."
00:17:21.916,00:17:23.125,I'm going to fire four words at you.
00:17:23.167,00:17:29.089,"Liza Minnelli, Celine Dion."
00:17:29.131,00:17:32.092,"SANDY: Oh, yeah."
00:17:32.134,00:17:33.469,I am yours.
00:18:14.427,00:18:15.929,Wow.
00:18:15.970,00:18:17.638,What's next?
00:18:17.680,00:18:20.767,"Congratulations, Miss Sally Bowles."
00:18:20.808,00:18:22.518,You have just landed the lead.
00:18:26.397,00:18:28.983,This is a joke.
00:18:29.025,00:18:32.361,"William, Sandy's never been formally charged with anything."
00:18:32.403,00:18:36.783,"And the fact is, upon further reflection, my firing of him was rash."
00:18:36.824,00:18:38.952,"This is a wonderful thing, Will."
00:18:38.993,00:18:43.790,How many times have you sat in the chair complaining how I don't care about the arts program?
00:18:43.831,00:18:45.165,This was you.
00:18:45.207,00:18:46.793,You have always been out to get me.
00:18:46.834,00:18:50.880,"Well, if I was out to get you, I'd have you pickling in a mason jar on my shelf by now."
00:18:50.922,00:18:52.172,"William, take a chill pill."
00:18:52.214,00:18:53.173,I'm here to help you.
00:18:53.215,00:18:54.968,"Oh, really?"
00:18:55.009,00:18:56.677,Is that why you stole my best singer?
00:18:58.638,00:19:02.182,"An opportunity arose for me to showcase my talents, and I took it."
00:19:02.224,00:19:05.979,How's that any different from when you quit Glee to form your boy band?
00:19:06.020,00:19:07.438,Because I didn't do it out of spite.
00:19:09.231,00:19:11.609,I've always been a team player.
00:19:11.651,00:19:14.236,"Just admit it, Mr. Shue, you don't like me very much."
00:19:14.278,00:19:15.488,That's not true.
00:19:15.529,00:19:21.327,"I am your biggest-- and sometimes, your only-- fan."
00:19:23.121,00:19:25.039,"Look, I know who I am, okay?"
00:19:25.081,00:19:28.208,"I know I can be a little abrasive, bossy and conceited."
00:19:28.250,00:19:32.212,"I'm just hurt that you chose to judge me on that, rather than on my talent."
00:19:32.254,00:19:35.424,"I know it sounds awful, but I'm the best one in there."
00:19:35.466,00:19:38.218,"I try the hardest, and I want it the most."
00:19:38.260,00:19:40.930,Everyone knows that.
00:19:40.972,00:19:44.224,They all think that they can slack off because you'll pick up their weight.
00:19:44.266,00:19:46.226,We can't win Regionals like that.
00:19:46.268,00:19:48.938,We need everyone to think that they're a star.
00:19:48.980,00:19:51.482,We're giving everyone a chance to think they're a star.
00:19:55.277,00:19:56.737,"Find your voice, stomp that yard..."
00:19:56.779,00:19:58.447,all that crap.
00:19:58.489,00:20:00.240,What does she have on you?
00:20:00.282,00:20:01.283,SANDY: Enough!
00:20:03.577,00:20:06.246,"I tried to play nice with you, William."
00:20:06.288,00:20:09.625,"But clearly, you prefer to be adversaries."
00:20:09.667,00:20:11.293,So be it.
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.173,I'm not quitting Glee.
00:20:15.214,00:20:16.757,I'm just looking for a reason to stay.
00:20:16.799,00:20:18.759,"Oh, like me taking the solo away from Tina?"
00:20:18.801,00:20:21.846,Everyone on the team is getting something out of being there.
00:20:21.888,00:20:26.684,"You're doing a great job of getting them out of their shells, except for me."
00:20:29.311,00:20:31.355,I still don't have a boyfriend.
00:20:34.316,00:20:36.944,why do you have to hurt me to make her feel good?
00:20:36.986,00:20:38.905,Just come to rehearsal.
00:21:56.857,00:21:58.943,"That was great, Tina."
00:21:58.985,00:22:00.278,You don't have to say that.
00:22:00.319,00:22:01.361,I was sh-sharp.
00:22:02.404,00:22:03.823,I c-c-can't do this.
00:22:03.864,00:22:05.283,"Hey, look at me."
00:22:06.033,00:22:08.368,"Have you noticed the more confident you are, the less you stutter?"
00:22:10.663,00:22:14.374,"Hey, I need you to be great at Regionals."
00:22:14.416,00:22:16.335,"To do that, you've got to know that you can do this."
00:22:19.797,00:22:21.799,You have to give this song to Rachel.
00:22:21.841,00:22:23.968,She's better than me.
00:22:24.010,00:22:27.305,And you know she'll quit if you don't.
00:22:27.345,00:22:28.889,I'll t-take one for the team.
00:22:32.434,00:22:33.519,"Hey, Finn, what's up?"
00:22:40.609,00:22:43.403,It's okay.
00:22:43.445,00:22:45.323,It's okay.
00:22:51.369,00:22:52.621,"Thanks a lot for this, Mr. Shue."
00:22:52.663,00:22:54.707,"I couldn't talk to my mom, you know?"
00:22:54.748,00:22:57.584,Yeah. So how far along is she?
00:22:57.626,00:23:01.421,"Uh, I don't know, uh, a couple of weeks, maybe."
00:23:01.463,00:23:04.424,"It's pretty recent, I guess."
00:23:04.466,00:23:06.635,"Well, what do you..."
00:23:06.677,00:23:08.054,You want me to...
00:23:08.095,00:23:09.638,You want me to set you up with Planned Parenthood?
00:23:09.680,00:23:11.140,No.
00:23:11.182,00:23:12.432,"No, it's not even a conversation."
00:23:12.474,00:23:14.185,She's keeping it.
00:23:15.477,00:23:19.481,I've seen the guys around town who had kids in high school.
00:23:19.523,00:23:24.486,They work here or at the supermarket or pumping gas or worse.
00:23:24.528,00:23:26.322,They're caged.
00:23:26.364,00:23:29.367,Got no future.
00:23:29.407,00:23:31.285,I can't become one of those dudes.
00:23:31.327,00:23:34.288,"Mr. Shue, I've got to go to college."
00:23:34.330,00:23:36.957,"But we don't have any money, and..."
00:23:36.999,00:23:42.338,"I need a football scholarship, but the only way I'm going to get one is if we start winning."
00:23:42.380,00:23:43.964,I'm not a football coach.
00:23:46.217,00:23:51.389,"Remember when we were working on that Acafella stuff, and you helped me and Puck with the dancing?"
00:23:51.429,00:23:52.472,Yeah.
00:23:52.514,00:23:53.849,You loosened us up.
00:23:53.891,00:23:55.893,That's the football team's problem.
00:23:55.935,00:23:57.937,I figured it out watching Kurt kick those field goals.
00:23:57.978,00:23:59.437,Check this out.
00:24:00.773,00:24:02.482,I got this at the school library.
00:24:03.525,00:24:06.653,Did you know you can just borrow books from there?
00:24:06.695,00:24:07.947,All of them.
00:24:07.988,00:24:09.949,"Except for the encyclopedias, but..."
00:24:09.990,00:24:14.412,It says in here that Walter Payton was a great dancer.
00:24:14.452,00:24:18.416,"In college, he-he won dance competitions on Soul Train."
00:24:18.456,00:24:20.500,And he took ballet lessons.
00:24:20.542,00:24:24.671,And he even got the whole Bears team to take them the year they won the Super Bowl.
00:24:24.713,00:24:26.506,That's how they came up with The Super Bowl Shuffle.
00:24:26.548,00:24:27.883,Let me just get this straight.
00:24:27.925,00:24:30.468,You want me to teach the football team how to dance?
00:24:31.845,00:24:34.807,Uh... I don't think Ken will go for that.
00:24:34.848,00:24:36.474,We'll talk him into it.
00:24:38.185,00:24:40.438,"Look, you said you needed guys for Glee Club, right?"
00:24:40.478,00:24:44.733,"If you can help us win one game, they'll start to trust you."
00:24:44.775,00:24:47.361,Then I'm sure some of them will want to join.
00:24:49.571,00:24:52.366,It's a win-win for both of us.
00:24:59.457,00:25:02.168,Eat up.
00:25:02.209,00:25:04.128,How far along is she?
00:25:04.170,00:25:06.130,A few weeks.
00:25:06.172,00:25:07.798,It breaks my heart.
00:25:07.840,00:25:09.549,"I mean, they're both so scared to death, Ter."
00:25:09.591,00:25:10.843,They're just kids.
00:25:10.884,00:25:12.552,They can't raise a baby.
00:25:12.594,00:25:17.557,"Here this poor girl is so ashamed, she feels like she can't tell anybody."
00:25:17.599,00:25:19.601,Can you imagine?
00:25:22.271,00:25:24.398,Having to hide something like that?
00:25:25.399,00:25:28.526,"All that effort, covering that up."
00:25:29.862,00:25:31.489,What did you say her name was?
00:25:31.529,00:25:33.449,Quinn?
00:25:33.491,00:25:36.534,"Oh, and here's the kicker: she's president of the Celibacy Club."
00:25:47.713,00:25:49.589,This is garbage!
00:25:49.631,00:25:51.425,What the hell does BeyoncÃ© have to do with football?
00:25:51.467,00:25:52.592,Why don't you ask Kurt?
00:25:52.634,00:25:54.678,He seems to be the only one who can score on this team.
00:25:54.720,00:25:55.846,Even in practice.
00:25:54.720,00:25:58.391,So we're taking coaching advice from Lance Bass now?
00:25:58.432,00:26:00.267,Guys! Guys!
00:26:00.309,00:26:02.602,"Athletes are performers, just like singers and dancers."
00:26:02.644,00:26:04.604,Think about it.
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.192,O.J.
00:26:08.234,00:26:09.527,"O.J., right."
00:26:09.567,00:26:11.904,All pretty tough guys.
00:26:11.945,00:26:14.323,All of them had big careers as performers.
00:26:14.365,00:26:17.617,"Now, I don't think you guys are losing because you don't have the talent."
00:26:17.659,00:26:19.537,You're losing because you don't have the right attitude.
00:26:19.577,00:26:20.620,"Oh, I get it."
00:26:20.662,00:26:22.915,We have to think more like Amazonian Black women.
00:26:22.956,00:26:24.083,Think about it.
00:26:24.124,00:26:27.669,"If you can sing and dance in front of people, everything else is easy."
00:26:27.711,00:26:30.089,"Coach, please."
00:26:30.130,00:26:31.631,I'm down with it.
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.551,"I mean, heck, what do we got to lose?"
00:26:33.591,00:26:36.636,We gave up our pride when we lost to that school for the deaf.
00:26:38.680,00:26:42.351,Sun Tzu says in his Art of War to never let the enemy know you.
00:26:42.393,00:26:44.644,Our greatest weapon could be the element of surprise.
00:26:44.686,00:26:49.816,Don't tell me that you wouldn't be on your heels if the other team started busting a move on the field.
00:26:51.609,00:26:55.322,"Okay, too much talking, not enough stretching."
00:26:53.571,00:26:57.116,In the choir room in full pads in five.
00:26:57.157,00:26:58.658,That's five minutes.
00:26:58.700,00:27:01.661,"Five, six, seven, eight."
00:27:07.376,00:27:08.877,"That's good, guys."
00:27:08.919,00:27:11.671,"Your hips are still a little tight, okay?"
00:27:11.713,00:27:13.466,It's just like you're playing football.
00:27:13.507,00:27:14.674,It's all about the lateral movement.
00:27:14.716,00:27:16.051,Just stay low and...
00:27:16.093,00:27:17.511,May I?
00:27:17.553,00:27:19.555,Watch Kurt.
00:27:21.307,00:27:22.891,"All right, boys."
00:27:22.933,00:27:24.893,"Five, six, seven..."
00:27:24.935,00:27:26.686,"Hand, hand."
00:27:26.728,00:27:28.063,Point to the finger.
00:27:28.105,00:27:29.731,"Hip, head."
00:27:29.773,00:27:32.067,"Oh, sneak attack back to the ring."
00:27:32.109,00:27:33.319,Comb through the hair.
00:27:33.360,00:27:34.694,Slap the butt.
00:27:35.737,00:27:38.698,"Okay, that's enough for today, gentlemen."
00:27:38.740,00:27:39.992,We'll work on it.
00:27:40.033,00:27:41.410,Just hit the showers.
00:27:44.121,00:27:49.751,"Um, Coach, I don't mean to interject, but, um, I think we should end with a show circle."
00:27:51.128,00:27:53.297,PUCK: What's your problem?
00:27:53.339,00:27:55.966,Nothing. I just got a lot on my mind.
00:27:56.008,00:27:58.969,"Seriously, dude, what's going on?"
00:27:59.011,00:28:01.430,I'm your best friend.
00:28:01.472,00:28:03.349,Talk.
00:28:04.766,00:28:06.226,I knew it.
00:28:06.268,00:28:07.561,You're in love with Kurt.
00:28:07.603,00:28:09.605,Quinn's pregnant.
00:28:20.782,00:28:22.660,"'Sup, MILF?"
00:28:22.700,00:28:24.702,Leave me alone.
00:28:26.246,00:28:29.333,Who's the daddy?
00:28:29.375,00:28:33.753,I just think it's kind of weird if it's Finn since you told me you were a virgin when we did it.
00:28:33.795,00:28:36.048,And I know for a fact that you didn't do it with him.
00:28:36.089,00:28:38.175,How can you be so sure?
00:28:38.217,00:28:40.469,Finn's my boy.
00:28:40.511,00:28:43.096,You make a habit of sleeping with your boy's girlfriends?
00:28:44.806,00:28:46.141,"Well, call the Vatican!"
00:28:46.183,00:28:49.144,We got ourselves another immaculate conception.
00:28:49.186,00:28:50.770,"I'd take care of it, you know."
00:28:50.812,00:28:53.273,"You, too."
00:28:53.315,00:28:55.401,"My dad's a deadbeat, but I don't roll that way."
00:28:55.442,00:28:58.820,Weren't you fired for peeing in the fast-food fryolator?
00:28:58.862,00:29:01.240,I've got my pool cleaning business.
00:29:01.281,00:29:02.408,We live in Ohio.
00:29:04.034,00:29:10.790,I had sex with you because you got me drunk on wine coolers and I felt fat that day.
00:29:10.832,00:29:12.501,But it was a mistake.
00:29:13.752,00:29:17.047,You're a Lima loser and you're always going to be a Lima loser.
00:29:33.439,00:29:35.399,How many weeks are you?
00:29:35.441,00:29:38.277,"From the looks of you, I'd say no more than five or six."
00:29:38.318,00:29:40.446,I assume you haven't told your parents yet.
00:29:40.487,00:29:41.821,How could you?
00:29:41.863,00:29:44.366,After Daddy bought you this car so you could drive him to the Chastity Ball.
00:29:45.867,00:29:47.745,"You can't raise this baby, Quinn."
00:29:47.786,00:29:49.913,"I'm sorry, but who are you?"
00:29:49.955,00:29:52.625,I'm just somebody who wants to help.
00:29:52.666,00:29:54.834,I don't need your help.
00:29:54.876,00:29:56.420,Really?
00:29:56.462,00:29:58.505,What kind of prenatal vitamins are you taking?
00:30:04.553,00:30:08.474,"Here, three times a day or your baby will be ugly."
00:30:09.767,00:30:12.478,I don't understand.
00:30:12.519,00:30:14.187,What do you want from me?
00:30:32.831,00:30:34.291,W-M-H-S!
00:30:34.333,00:30:36.876,WILL: Anyone sitting here?
00:30:36.918,00:30:38.253,"Um, no."
00:30:38.295,00:30:39.797,"No, here..."
00:30:39.838,00:30:41.089,CHEERLEADERS: W-M-H-S!
00:30:41.131,00:30:42.466,W-M-H-S!
00:30:42.508,00:30:44.884,"Well, at least I know it's clean."
00:31:04.446,00:31:07.199,"Well, I think we, uh, really came together this week as a team."
00:31:07.240,00:31:09.618,"PUCK: Yeah, a gay team."
00:31:09.660,00:31:11.911,"A big, gay team of dancing gays."
00:31:13.330,00:31:17.376,"Seriously, Finn, it was fun in practice and all, but we can't do that out here in front of everybody."
00:31:17.417,00:31:19.169,It'll make us even more of a joke.
00:31:33.975,00:31:35.352,"All right, divert right."
00:31:35.394,00:31:37.604,87 on one. Break!
00:31:39.398,00:31:41.316,"BOY: Yo, QB!"
00:31:41.358,00:31:44.570,"Your mama's so fat, the back of her neck looks like a pack of hot dogs."
00:31:44.611,00:31:45.404,Give me some ketchup!
00:31:45.445,00:31:46.446,"Down, set, hut!"
00:31:56.998,00:31:58.375,"Punch and Judy on one, break!"
00:32:00.711,00:32:02.003,Come on!
00:32:08.468,00:32:10.262,Dad!
00:32:11.471,00:32:13.557,Dad!
00:32:13.599,00:32:15.016,I told you!
00:32:15.058,00:32:16.518,I told...
00:32:18.437,00:32:20.397,FINN: Jordan versus Bird on one!
00:32:22.441,00:32:24.359,Run!
00:32:31.032,00:32:33.452,Cupid tips on one. Break.
00:32:55.557,00:32:56.683,Time out.
00:33:02.439,00:33:05.024,"Dude, we got to do it."
00:33:05.066,00:33:07.402,We will be jokes for the rest of our high school lives.
00:33:07.444,00:33:08.862,We're already jokes.
00:33:08.904,00:33:11.573,I don't want to be a Lima loser for the rest of my life.
00:33:16.578,00:33:21.625,"Yo, left tackle-- your mama's so fat, her cereal comes with its own lifeguard-- like Baywatch!"
00:33:21.667,00:33:23.001,"Hey, ankle grabber."
00:33:23.961,00:33:25.754,I had sex with your mother.
00:33:30.091,00:33:31.677,Nice Star Wars sheets.
00:33:35.096,00:33:36.932,"Let's do it, Captain."
00:33:38.099,00:33:39.685,"Come on, huddle up."
00:33:39.726,00:33:41.060,Huddle up.
00:33:41.102,00:33:44.022,"Okay, Ring On It on three."
00:33:45.148,00:33:46.692,Yeah. All right?
00:33:46.733,00:33:48.986,"Come on, on-on three."
00:33:59.329,00:34:04.960,"Hut one, two, three."
00:34:05.002,00:34:06.336,Let's hit it.
00:35:11.443,00:35:13.319,Hike.
00:35:31.421,00:35:33.590,Yeah!
00:35:53.443,00:35:55.487,"You're up, kid."
00:35:55.528,00:35:58.364,You make this and we win.
00:35:58.406,00:36:03.244,You make this...
00:36:03.286,00:36:05.455,Can I pee first?
00:36:16.508,00:36:19.218,He's so little.
00:36:32.649,00:36:35.234,Ten hut.
00:37:37.172,00:37:40.383,Nighttime skin care is a big part of my postgame ritual.
00:37:40.425,00:37:43.553,"I don't know what to say about that, but, uh..."
00:37:45.346,00:37:47.807,"I was really proud of you tonight, Kurt."
00:37:49.017,00:37:51.019,I wish your mom would have been there.
00:37:51.061,00:37:53.563,"I mean, alive."
00:37:53.605,00:37:55.774,Thanks.
00:37:59.444,00:38:00.528,Dad...
00:38:02.530,00:38:06.409,I... have something that I want to say.
00:38:09.537,00:38:18.171,"I'm glad that you're proud of me, but I don't want to lie anymore."
00:38:18.213,00:38:27.346,Being a part of... the glee club and football has really showed me that I can be anything.
00:38:27.388,00:38:30.308,And what I am...
00:38:31.392,00:38:33.311,...is...
00:38:34.395,00:38:37.107,I'm gay.
00:38:38.191,00:38:40.401,I know.
00:38:40.443,00:38:41.569,Really?
00:38:41.611,00:38:44.322,I've known since you were three.
00:38:45.406,00:38:48.367,All you wanted for your birthday was a pair of sensible heels.
00:38:51.412,00:38:56.168,"I guess I'm not totally in love with the idea, but..."
00:38:56.209,00:38:59.462,"if that's who you are, there's nothing I can do about it."
00:39:00.505,00:39:02.590,And I love you just as much.
00:39:05.135,00:39:06.928,Okay?
00:39:10.473,00:39:13.059,"Thanks for telling me, Kurt."
00:39:22.443,00:39:24.403,"You're sure, right?"
00:39:24.445,00:39:26.239,"Yeah, Dad, I'm sure."
00:39:26.281,00:39:27.448,I'm just checking.
00:39:34.455,00:39:36.541,Hey.
00:39:37.500,00:39:39.418,Here.
00:39:39.460,00:39:41.004,It's my gee-ge.
00:39:41.046,00:39:44.507,This is the baby blanket my dad got me the day I was born.
00:39:44.549,00:39:46.801,It was the only thing I had to remember him by.
00:39:46.843,00:39:49.428,I used to cry without it.
00:39:49.470,00:39:51.014,I took it everywhere with me.
00:39:52.473,00:39:54.184,But I want our baby to have it.
00:39:55.476,00:39:58.521,I'm going to do everything I can to be a good father.
00:40:01.524,00:40:03.442,"Thank you, Finn."
00:40:04.485,00:40:06.279,How you doing?
00:40:07.280,00:40:10.449,"You know, lately I've been getting really sick in the morning."
00:40:10.491,00:40:12.160,Must be a virus.
00:40:12.202,00:40:13.536,"Hey, you putting on a little weight?"
00:40:13.578,00:40:14.537,You should watch your carbs.
00:40:14.579,00:40:19.458,They're not going to be able to hoist you to the top of that cheerleading pyramid much longer.
00:40:19.500,00:40:21.419,"Hey, don't talk to my girlfriend like that."
00:40:26.674,00:40:28.509,"You know what, you're right."
00:40:28.551,00:40:30.428,I was out of line.
00:40:32.513,00:40:35.558,See you guys around.
00:40:40.521,00:40:43.482,"You know, there's a question I get asked a lot."
00:40:43.524,00:40:51.783,"Whether I'm accepting an honorary doctorate or performing a citizen's arrest-- people ask me, Sue, what's your secret?"
00:40:51.824,00:40:55.494,"Well, I'll tell you my secret, western Ohio."
00:40:55.536,00:41:00.208,"Hey, guys, let's give a big Glee welcome to our three new members fresh off their big win on Friday night."
00:41:00.250,00:41:03.502,"Noah Puckerman, Matt Rutherford and Mike Chang."
00:41:03.544,00:41:05.504,"Regionals, here we come."
00:41:05.546,00:41:09.217,Sue Sylvester's not afraid to shake things up.
00:41:09.259,00:41:13.138,Let's start today with Tonight from West Side Story.
00:41:14.722,00:41:16.474,Tina...
00:41:17.558,00:41:20.519,Show us what you got.
00:41:20.561,00:41:27.526,"SUE: You know, I'm tired of hearing people complain, I'm riddled with this disease, or I was in that tsunami."
00:41:29.570,00:41:31.323,Get out of your box.
00:41:31.364,00:41:34.409,Even if that box happens to be where you're living.
00:41:34.451,00:41:37.536,"I thought you had Glee practice, my little multitasking star."
00:41:37.578,00:41:39.538,I quit.
00:41:39.580,00:41:41.374,I'm yours exclusively.
00:41:41.416,00:41:46.463,"I'll often yell at homeless people, Hey, how's that homelessness working out for you?"
00:41:46.504,00:41:49.174,"Give not being homeless a try, huh?"
00:41:49.215,00:41:50.842,Maybe this time in B-flat.
00:41:50.883,00:41:52.593,"You know something, Ohio?"
00:41:52.635,00:41:55.554,It's not easy to break out of your comfort zone.
00:41:55.596,00:41:57.432,People will tear you down.
00:41:57.474,00:41:59.476,Tell you you shouldn't have bothered in the first place.
00:41:59.517,00:42:01.560,But let me tell you something.
00:42:01.602,00:42:10.028,There's not much of a difference between a stadium full of cheering fans and an angry crowd screaming abuse at you.
00:42:10.069,00:42:12.571,They're both just making a lot of noise.
00:42:12.613,00:42:14.991,How you take it is up to you.
00:42:15.033,00:42:17.369,Convince yourself they're cheering for you.
00:42:17.410,00:42:21.414,"You do that, and someday they will."
00:42:21.456,00:42:23.749,And that's how Sue sees it.
00:00:01.585,00:00:03.044,Here's what happened last week: Quinn told Finn...
00:00:03.086,00:00:05.464,I'm pregnant.
00:00:05.506,00:00:07.299,Puck is. Can you believe that?
00:00:07.341,00:00:08.884,Wow.
00:00:08.926,00:00:10.719,"Terri says she's pregnant, but really she's faking."
00:00:10.761,00:00:12.888,And Mr. Shuester doesn't know.
00:00:45.838,00:00:47.046,"Quinn, you okay?"
00:00:48.632,00:00:51.468,I think she just had a bad breakfast burrito.
00:00:51.510,00:00:53.261,Can we please talk about the giant elephant in the room?
00:00:53.303,00:00:55.096,Your sexuality?
00:00:55.138,00:00:57.140,Rachel-- we can't do it without her.
00:00:57.182,00:00:58.809,That's not true.
00:00:58.851,00:01:04.732,We may have to layer Santana and Mercedes over Quinn's solo but...
00:01:04.773,00:01:08.151,"Maybe for the invitationals, but not for the sectionals and certainly not the regionals."
00:01:08.193,00:01:09.110,The wheelchair kid's right.
00:01:09.152,00:01:12.113,"That Rachel chick makes me want to light myself on fire, but she can sing."
00:01:14.157,00:01:15.325,She's gone.
00:01:15.367,00:01:19.079,"Now, if we're gonna make this thing work, we can't look back."
00:01:20.831,00:01:22.249,"All right, take five, guys."
00:01:24.167,00:01:27.796,"Um, Mr. Shue?"
00:01:27.838,00:01:30.215,"I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but, uh..."
00:01:30.257,00:01:32.300,with all the dancing around that Quinn's doing...
00:01:32.342,00:01:34.135,I'm kind of worried about the baby.
00:01:34.177,00:01:35.804,Yeah.
00:01:35.846,00:01:37.138,"Yeah, I get it."
00:01:37.180,00:01:39.140,Um...
00:01:39.182,00:01:42.061,"how about I give Tina a few of her verses, okay?"
00:01:42.101,00:01:43.311,Okay.
00:01:43.353,00:01:46.147,You think you might want to tell your mom about what's going on?
00:01:46.189,00:01:48.442,I think I'd rather handle it myself right now.
00:01:48.483,00:01:50.193,My mom's got enough to worry about.
00:02:01.246,00:02:04.165,How come you haven't had any morning sickness?
00:02:06.710,00:02:08.169,Really?
00:02:08.211,00:02:09.755,That's a really good sign.
00:02:14.217,00:02:16.095,"Oh, no, honey, no, no."
00:02:16.136,00:02:20.432,You should ask Howard Bamboo about my Linda Blair impersonations every half hour at work.
00:02:23.018,00:02:25.186,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this whole Rachel thing.
00:02:25.228,00:02:27.188,Hey. Would you like anything else?
00:02:27.230,00:02:29.357,Another piece of grasshopper pie.
00:02:29.399,00:02:31.192,"What, are you going for the record?"
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.193,I'm with child.
00:02:32.235,00:02:33.821,"Hey, did you go to McKinley High?"
00:02:33.862,00:02:35.906,I think I had you in my Spanish class.
00:02:35.948,00:02:36.907,"Yeah, like, five years ago."
00:02:36.949,00:02:37.992,I go to Carmel now.
00:02:38.033,00:02:39.284,How is that possible?
00:02:39.326,00:02:40.786,You must be 22.
00:02:40.828,00:02:41.787,Twenty-four.
00:02:41.829,00:02:43.246,I'm a sixth-year senior.
00:02:43.288,00:02:45.457,They keep failing me so I can stay in Vocal Adrenaline.
00:02:45.499,00:02:46.917,They fail you on purpose?
00:02:46.959,00:02:48.460,Yeah.
00:02:48.502,00:02:50.211,I'm the only one who can do the triple flip.
00:02:52.673,00:02:54.299,How about it.
00:03:03.558,00:03:05.560,Fine.
00:03:11.190,00:03:14.235,So... have I done something wrong... or...?
00:03:22.327,00:03:31.962,"Look, I know sometimes that life can come at you pretty fast, and, uh, you reach a point where you might just need a little, um, special guidance."
00:03:32.004,00:03:35.215,Has someone told you something about my personal life?
00:03:37.300,00:03:38.343,No. Mm-mm.
00:03:38.385,00:03:40.137,Can you keep a secret?
00:03:40.179,00:03:44.850,"But, you know, there are very few students that ever get athletic scholarships."
00:03:44.892,00:03:49.479,Okay? But there are a lot of schools that give full rides to students who excel in music.
00:03:49.521,00:03:51.272,Students like yourself.
00:03:51.314,00:04:01.491,"And I don't know, maybe if you were able to go to college, you wouldn't, say, end up stuck in this town in a dead-end job living hand- to-mouth with a wife and a kid you never intended to have, you know?"
00:04:01.533,00:04:02.910,For example.
00:04:02.951,00:04:04.285,That's just something off the top of my head.
00:04:04.327,00:04:07.539,So you think if I stuck with Glee that I could get a scholarship?
00:04:07.581,00:04:09.208,It's definitely a possibility.
00:04:12.335,00:04:13.294,But we lost Rachel.
00:04:13.336,00:04:15.296,Do you think we can do it without her?
00:04:15.338,00:04:16.297,Sure.
00:04:17.507,00:04:19.760,Do you think we can win regionals without Rachel?
00:04:19.801,00:04:22.303,"Well, remember the Jamaican bobsled team?"
00:04:22.345,00:04:24.347,Big long shots.
00:04:24.389,00:04:26.100,Definitely.
00:04:26.141,00:04:36.110,"But if you're concerned about your future and, um, those who may be a part of your future soon, um, maybe you could just give Rachel a talk."
00:04:36.151,00:04:38.319,"You know, see if you can get her to come back."
00:04:40.530,00:04:45.786,How does it feel to be just a sophomore and get the lead in the school musical?
00:04:45.827,00:04:47.829,It's an honor.
00:04:47.871,00:04:49.497,"Frankly, one I feel I've earned."
00:04:49.539,00:04:56.337,"If there's anything I've learned in my 16 years on the stage, it's that stars are rare, and when they're found, you have to let them shine."
00:04:58.882,00:05:00.134,You mean the one I'm wearing?
00:05:00.175,00:05:01.260,"Quid pro quo, Rachel."
00:05:01.301,00:05:04.345,"If you want a good review, show me your over the shoulder boulder holder."
00:05:04.387,00:05:06.347,No way. You can't do that.
00:05:06.389,00:05:07.557,My performance will stand on its own.
00:05:07.599,00:05:09.350,"Besides, no one reads the school paper, anyway."
00:05:09.392,00:05:12.146,"Oh, but I'll post my scathing review online."
00:05:12.187,00:05:14.148,You'll be finished on the high school stage.
00:05:14.189,00:05:16.150,"Now, get those sweater puppies out of their cashmere cage."
00:05:18.401,00:05:19.360,Sorry I'm late.
00:05:19.402,00:05:21.362,My Vespa had a flat.
00:05:21.404,00:05:24.241,Give me a minute and I will be ready for my interview.
00:05:24.283,00:05:28.078,"We're actually not gonna need any quotes from you for the article, Mr. Ryerson."
00:05:28.120,00:05:29.746,Do the right thing.
00:05:29.788,00:05:31.456,All the great actresses take their clothes off.
00:05:31.498,00:05:33.583,"RYERSON: Well, I have no problem with nudity."
00:05:33.625,00:05:38.255,Let me tell you about my planned production of Equus.
00:05:38.297,00:05:40.339,Have you ever hung out at a stable?
00:05:44.594,00:05:47.181,"Hey, what are you doing?"
00:05:47.222,00:05:50.267,getting the star treatment I didn't get in Glee.
00:05:51.434,00:05:54.896,It's times like this where I know I've chosen the right path.
00:05:54.938,00:05:56.315,I'm never going back to Glee.
00:05:56.355,00:05:58.399,It's clear my talent is too big for an ensemble.
00:05:58.441,00:05:59.985,Not gonna get an argument from me.
00:06:00.027,00:06:02.070,I'm not?
00:06:02.112,00:06:04.572,"No. You're, like, the most talented person I know."
00:06:04.614,00:06:07.492,Even more than that guy at the mall who can juggle chain saws.
00:06:08.535,00:06:14.373,"I just wanted to let you know that if you need someone to run lines with, I'm available."
00:06:16.835,00:06:18.837,Th-There is a lot of dialogue.
00:06:18.879,00:06:20.630,I figured...
00:06:20.672,00:06:24.383,"we could go somewhere quiet, maybe with low lighting and..."
00:06:27.846,00:06:30.431,Let me know.
00:06:37.689,00:06:40.441,I could get fired for this.
00:06:40.483,00:06:42.443,She was a student 15 years ago.
00:06:42.485,00:06:44.238,No one is gonna care.
00:06:44.279,00:06:46.948,Okay.
00:06:50.160,00:06:52.079,I-I knew it.
00:06:52.120,00:06:53.163,She never graduated.
00:06:54.706,00:06:57.625,"Yeah, I, um, I saw her picture in the folder."
00:06:57.667,00:06:59.044,Pretty.
00:06:59.086,00:07:00.128,Pretty?
00:07:00.170,00:07:00.962,Mm.
00:07:01.004,00:07:03.340,April Rhodes was a goddess.
00:07:03.382,00:07:06.467,The most talented performer in McKinley Glee Club history.
00:07:06.509,00:07:10.180,"When she sang, it was mesmerizing."
00:07:11.973,00:07:13.474,She was my first crush.
00:07:13.516,00:07:15.269,"I was a freshman, she was a senior."
00:07:15.310,00:07:18.063,"Wait, hold on, 'cause I thought you said your wife was your first crush."
00:07:18.105,00:07:21.358,"Well, yeah, that's because April didn't even look at me."
00:07:21.400,00:07:22.901,"Aw, crap, there's no forwarding address."
00:07:22.943,00:07:25.362,S-So then you've-you've had feelings for someone other than your wife.
00:07:25.404,00:07:29.283,"Emma, I'd love to play This Is Your Life, but Lord Google demands my attention."
00:07:29.324,00:07:31.701,"Okay, just wait-wait."
00:07:31.743,00:07:35.330,"Um, reaching back into your past is a dangerous business, okay?"
00:07:35.372,00:07:36.497,People can change.
00:07:36.539,00:07:38.208,"They can, um, disappoint you..."
00:07:38.250,00:07:39.418,I think I can handle it.
00:07:39.459,00:07:42.421,"I thought I could, too."
00:07:48.176,00:07:50.511,"Things got weird, and I called it off."
00:07:50.553,00:07:52.472,And two months later...
00:07:54.349,00:07:55.725,...Versace was dead.
00:07:57.144,00:07:58.353,Dead.
00:07:58.395,00:07:59.187,Okay.
00:08:00.397,00:08:02.523,April Rhodes...
00:08:02.565,00:08:04.525,Oh! She has a MySpace page.
00:08:06.236,00:08:08.529,"Oh, and here's a link to her own personal Web site."
00:08:08.571,00:08:10.324,She's online.
00:08:12.159,00:08:14.535,"Hi, April."
00:08:14.577,00:08:19.207,"Not sure if you remember me, but my name is Will Schuester."
00:08:20.750,00:08:24.921,"35 Bontempo Road, between 2:00 and 3:00."
00:08:24.963,00:08:26.047,Bring buffalo wings.
00:08:38.310,00:08:39.269,April.
00:08:39.311,00:08:41.188,Hello.
00:08:41.229,00:08:42.230,Are you Will?
00:08:42.272,00:08:44.149,Y-You remember me?
00:08:44.191,00:08:47.235,"Mm. No, but I don't remember breakfast."
00:08:48.445,00:08:49.237,Come on in.
00:08:57.078,00:09:00.623,"Uh, I was a freshman when you were a senior."
00:09:00.665,00:09:03.460,"So, did I sleep with you?"
00:09:03.502,00:09:05.045,No.
00:09:05.086,00:09:07.297,Can I get you a drink?
00:09:07.339,00:09:10.633,I just cracked open a fresh box of wine.
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.389,This is a-a great place you have.
00:09:15.430,00:09:17.391,"Uh, looks like you're doing well for yourself."
00:09:17.432,00:09:23.021,"I get about five or six appointments on a good day from my World Wide Web page, so I do okay for myself."
00:09:24.523,00:09:30.987,"Why don't you have a seat, take off that jacket, and I'm gonna slip into something a little more comfortable."
00:09:32.447,00:09:41.081,"WOMAN: So, this is a beautiful five-bedroom with wood-burning fireplace and-- You."
00:09:41.122,00:09:43.542,This is the third time this week.
00:09:43.583,00:09:46.336,Who are you?
00:09:46.378,00:09:47.462,And she is a squatter.
00:09:48.671,00:09:51.299,The owners foreclosed six months ago.
00:09:51.341,00:09:54.094,"Let me just get my vino, and I'll be out of your hair."
00:09:54.135,00:09:55.803,Hold that.
00:09:55.845,00:09:57.347,"Oh, okay."
00:09:57.389,00:09:59.099,Just...
00:09:59.140,00:10:00.100,Nice place.
00:10:03.478,00:10:04.479,Can I ask you a question?
00:10:04.521,00:10:05.313,Yeah.
00:10:05.355,00:10:06.523,"What happened to you, April?"
00:10:06.565,00:10:09.443,"In high school, you were really going places."
00:10:09.484,00:10:11.570,You had a voice like a dream; everyone loved you.
00:10:12.695,00:10:16.657,"Oh, I hitched my star to the wrong wagon."
00:10:25.708,00:10:30.671,Then we ended up in Cleveland slinging hash at Ralph's Bait Shop and Waffle House.
00:10:30.713,00:10:33.674,Then Ralph had an affair with Vinny.
00:10:33.716,00:10:36.303,I had a set of mixed-race twins.
00:10:36.344,00:10:37.678,And those were the good times.
00:10:41.433,00:10:46.271,April... I think your struggle is really moving.
00:10:46.313,00:10:48.273,And I want to help you get back on your feet.
00:10:48.315,00:10:51.985,I happen to know that you're only three credits shy of your diploma.
00:10:52.026,00:10:54.154,I can put you in my Spanish class.
00:10:54.195,00:10:55.696,And...
00:10:55.738,00:10:58.533,I know you're an amazing singer.
00:10:58.575,00:10:59.951,I want you to be in the glee club.
00:10:59.993,00:11:01.411,We'll get you sobered up...
00:11:01.453,00:11:04.122,find you some underwear.
00:11:07.125,00:11:08.460,"It's not too late for you, April."
00:11:09.752,00:11:11.546,What do you say?
00:11:20.679,00:11:23.391,"Guys, I'd like to introduce you to someone very special."
00:11:23.433,00:11:25.726,This is April Rhodes.
00:11:25.768,00:11:27.103,She's our newest member.
00:11:28.396,00:11:31.358,"Wait, so old people can join Glee Club now?"
00:11:31.399,00:11:32.733,"Old, huh?"
00:11:32.775,00:11:35.362,You guys look like the world's worst Benetton ad.
00:11:37.071,00:11:40.450,"ARTIE: Mr. Schuester, this seems like a terrible idea."
00:11:40.492,00:11:42.536,April is a great singer.
00:11:42.577,00:11:44.579,And she never graduated.
00:11:44.621,00:11:48.041,"We appreciate what you're trying to do, but she's no Rachel."
00:11:48.082,00:11:48.916,Who's Rachel?
00:11:48.958,00:11:50.669,Sh-She's kind of our star.
00:11:50.709,00:11:52.671,"Your star, eh?"
00:11:52.711,00:11:53.754,"Well, where is she?"
00:11:53.796,00:11:54.755,She left.
00:11:54.797,00:11:56.216,To be the lead in Cabaret.
00:11:58.385,00:12:01.762,"Hey, Tinkles, give me Maybe This Time in B flat."
00:12:01.804,00:12:03.431,And don't let me catch you snoozing.
00:15:08.074,00:15:10.076,Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
00:15:12.995,00:15:18.918,"WILL: So, if I were to say, I'm going to Mexico for the day, would I use por or para?"
00:15:22.004,00:15:23.381,Para.
00:15:23.423,00:15:24.549,Por.
00:15:24.591,00:15:25.550,Oh.
00:15:25.592,00:15:28.803,I guess I better pour myself another Crantini.
00:15:30.012,00:15:30.971,I'm just kidding.
00:15:31.013,00:15:32.973,It's hot chocolate.
00:15:34.392,00:15:36.853,"All right, remember, guys, oral reports Wednesday."
00:15:36.895,00:15:39.355,"April, can I talk to you for a second?"
00:15:39.397,00:15:41.190,"I'm sorry, Will."
00:15:41.232,00:15:43.902,The old noodle just ain't what she used to be.
00:15:43.943,00:15:45.986,I huffed a lot of upholstery cleaner in the '90s.
00:15:46.028,00:15:54.495,"Look, April, I've been, uh, talking to the glee kids, and, um, I think they're still not so sure about having you around."
00:15:55.747,00:15:59.250,You draw a lot of attention to yourself.
00:15:59.292,00:16:01.001,And they're embarrassed enough as it is.
00:16:01.043,00:16:04.505,So do you think you could maybe take some time and try to win them over?
00:16:08.468,00:16:10.428,Yeah.
00:16:10.470,00:16:12.263,"Mm, smells like my Aunt Mildred."
00:16:16.267,00:16:17.393,Sweet.
00:16:17.435,00:16:19.019,With a bit of an afterburny taste.
00:16:19.061,00:16:21.606,"Oh, good Chablis should always have a little bite."
00:16:21.648,00:16:27.111,"Now, a few swigs of that every day before school, and you'll have all the courage you need to be yourself."
00:16:27.153,00:16:28.738,Really?
00:16:28.780,00:16:30.030,That's fantastic.
00:16:30.072,00:16:33.409,"Mm, so is my primo collection of vintage muscle magazines."
00:16:33.451,00:16:34.869,Want them?
00:16:36.078,00:16:37.747,"Mr. Schuester, I changed my mind."
00:16:37.789,00:16:39.039,April should stay.
00:16:39.081,00:16:41.000,I worship her.
00:16:46.088,00:16:48.048,"Oh, no, you got to be more natural."
00:16:48.090,00:16:49.634,I c-can't do this.
00:16:49.676,00:16:51.886,I don't understand why we're doing this in the first place.
00:16:51.928,00:16:54.472,Your lack of imagination astounds me.
00:16:54.514,00:16:55.640,This is only the beginning.
00:16:55.682,00:17:00.102,"If you can master this, you can sneak anything out of a store between your knees."
00:17:00.144,00:17:02.730,"Shoes, prom dresses."
00:17:02.772,00:17:05.065,I once got a cake out of a kid's birthday party.
00:17:05.107,00:17:06.526,With the candles still lit.
00:17:08.611,00:17:09.737,Are you sure?
00:17:21.040,00:17:22.458,Don't tickle me.
00:17:31.384,00:17:32.176,This is terrible.
00:17:35.513,00:17:36.556,This is a disaster.
00:17:38.516,00:17:39.767,I'm gonna barf.
00:17:39.809,00:17:42.102,Boring!
00:17:44.522,00:17:46.190,"No, no, no, no, no!"
00:17:49.151,00:17:50.361,"Well, I know what I don't want."
00:17:50.403,00:17:53.364,And it is all of this.
00:17:53.406,00:17:56.617,"When I gave you this part, I thought you could handle it, but clearly you can't."
00:17:56.659,00:18:02.707,What this show needs is a star with a little bit more maturity.
00:18:04.166,00:18:06.210,"You're trying to get me to quit, so you can be the star."
00:18:06.252,00:18:08.170,"Well, it won't work."
00:18:08.212,00:18:11.424,I'm not going anywhere.
00:18:12.759,00:18:14.761,I'll say.
00:18:21.183,00:18:23.811,I'm sleeping with him.
00:18:24.687,00:18:26.064,This play's weird.
00:18:26.105,00:18:27.857,That's Mr. Ryerson's favorite line.
00:18:27.899,00:18:29.859,"You're a really good actor, Finn."
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.403,Maybe you should consider joining the musical.
00:18:32.445,00:18:34.405,I'm pretty devoted to Glee.
00:18:34.447,00:18:36.365,I don't think I could just walk away from it.
00:18:36.407,00:18:38.451,I know how hard it was for you.
00:18:39.368,00:18:43.163,But I could justify doing both if you came back.
00:18:43.205,00:18:46.084,But we both know that's not gonna happen.
00:18:46.125,00:18:47.376,Do you know what we should do?
00:18:47.418,00:18:49.211,Elope?
00:18:49.253,00:18:50.797,Nothing.
00:18:50.838,00:18:52.757,We should go bowling.
00:18:52.799,00:18:54.884,You're always so stressed out about the play.
00:18:54.926,00:18:58.178,You just need to loosen up.
00:18:58.220,00:19:01.849,I always go bowling whenever I'm worked up about a big game or something.
00:19:03.225,00:19:04.769,Just us?
00:19:04.811,00:19:07.063,Yeah.
00:19:07.105,00:19:08.564,"Yeah, that-that-that would be great."
00:19:08.606,00:19:11.400,I-I am really stressed out.
00:19:11.442,00:19:13.360,But that's the price you pay for being a star.
00:19:13.402,00:19:14.821,APRIL: Don't I know it.
00:19:14.862,00:19:15.989,"WILL: Hey, Rachel."
00:19:16.030,00:19:19.033,"April Rhodes, Rachel Berry."
00:19:19.075,00:19:20.451,"Hey, can you give us the room, Rachel?"
00:19:20.493,00:19:22.369,We need to teach April the cues for Don't Stop Believing.
00:19:22.411,00:19:25.247,"Wait, she's singing the female lead?"
00:19:25.289,00:19:27.458,"Wait, she's in the glee club?"
00:19:27.500,00:19:28.918,She's... ancient.
00:19:30.252,00:19:32.130,"Talent doesn't age, sweetheart."
00:19:33.172,00:19:34.507,"That's Rachel's part, Mr. Shue."
00:19:34.548,00:19:37.593,"Well, Rachel's not in the glee club anymore."
00:19:37.635,00:19:38.636,"Thanks, Finn."
00:19:39.720,00:19:41.514,Rachel...
00:19:41.555,00:19:43.349,We're all really excited to see the play.
00:19:45.309,00:19:47.728,Make sure you save us a seat in the front row.
00:20:08.290,00:20:09.416,Kurt?
00:20:09.458,00:20:12.045,Hi.
00:20:13.546,00:20:17.175,"Kurt, I'm a girl who knows her solvents, and your breath smells like rubbing alcohol."
00:20:17.216,00:20:19.927,"Oh, Bambi."
00:20:19.969,00:20:24.473,I cried so hard when those hunters shot your mommy.
00:20:34.025,00:20:37.319,"Hey, Em. Just trying to figure out the set list for Saturday."
00:20:37.361,00:20:39.488,I just got back from the emergency room.
00:20:39.530,00:20:41.908,Had them give me four decontamination showers.
00:20:41.949,00:20:43.576,I think they call that the full Silkwood.
00:20:43.617,00:20:44.869,What happened?
00:20:47.329,00:20:54.128,"Not really fessing up to how he got the booze just yet, but I'm pretty sure it's not a fake ID, because he looks like an 11-year-old milkmaid."
00:20:55.337,00:20:57.297,"Will, I think it was April."
00:20:57.339,00:21:00.551,Her backpack's always clinking with empties.
00:21:00.593,00:21:02.302,I'm so sorry.
00:21:02.344,00:21:03.554,"I-I will, I'll talk to him."
00:21:03.596,00:21:05.472,Okay.
00:21:11.353,00:21:13.106,So am I.
00:21:13.147,00:21:14.941,I mean...
00:21:14.982,00:21:17.944,"if we don't place at regionals, it-it's all over."
00:21:19.820,00:21:27.161,"We have obligations as teachers, Will, to give kids opportunities for growth and enrichment."
00:21:27.203,00:21:35.294,"With April in Glee, you're taking away a kid's chance to grow, and you're giving it to someone whose brain is soaked in corn booze."
00:21:37.379,00:21:38.631,"April's not finished, Emma."
00:21:38.672,00:21:42.135,"And if Glee's gonna win, I need to give her a second chance."
00:21:42.176,00:21:48.348,She is a talented performer and I really think that the kids are going to learn a lot of valuable technique from her.
00:21:48.390,00:21:49.600,Okay.
00:21:49.642,00:21:53.520,But I think you need to think about...
00:21:53.562,00:21:58.317,why you're doing this and what you're willing to sacrifice to get it.
00:22:16.294,00:22:19.088,You...
00:22:19.130,00:22:23.425,suck!
00:22:34.436,00:22:36.438,Oh...
00:22:37.481,00:22:39.066,"Rough day at the office, cookie?"
00:22:39.108,00:22:41.277,I've just got a lot on my plate.
00:22:42.528,00:22:44.197,It's not easy being in the spotlight.
00:22:47.449,00:22:48.617,Yeah.
00:22:48.659,00:22:50.410,"I know that song, sister."
00:22:50.452,00:22:52.412,"Um, do you have any NyQuil?"
00:22:52.454,00:22:55.499,I could use a little pick-me-up.
00:22:55.541,00:22:57.459,No.
00:22:57.501,00:23:01.463,These high school boys are a lot hotter than they used to be.
00:23:04.466,00:23:05.843,"Finn's taken, April."
00:23:05.885,00:23:09.013,"Yeah, well, some guys like a little somethin'-somethin' on the side."
00:23:09.055,00:23:14.018,I think your behavior is totally inappropriate and your presence in this school is a complete travesty.
00:23:14.060,00:23:19.065,"What you choose to do with your life is your own business, but don't go around screwing up everyone else's."
00:23:20.482,00:23:22.735,"I'm not afraid of you, sweetie."
00:23:22.776,00:23:26.446,There was a time when I was the biggest star around here.
00:23:26.488,00:23:28.866,And now that I've got that back...
00:23:28.908,00:23:31.660,I'm never letting it go.
00:23:53.557,00:23:55.559,Do I have to put my fingers in the holes?
00:23:56.977,00:23:59.105,Couldn't there be diseases in there or something?
00:23:59.146,00:24:01.732,"Oh, no. Ball sharing's all part of the fun."
00:24:02.524,00:24:03.901,"Here, use the pink one."
00:24:03.943,00:24:05.903,"Pink's your favorite color, right?"
00:24:11.158,00:24:12.576,Follow my lead.
00:24:14.536,00:24:15.495,"Okay, so..."
00:24:15.537,00:24:18.207,Just look at the pins.
00:24:18.249,00:24:19.499,Nice and straight.
00:24:28.550,00:24:30.928,You sure this is your first time?
00:24:41.563,00:24:43.983,"Oh, ho-ho! April!"
00:24:44.024,00:24:45.443,Woo-hoo!
00:24:45.483,00:24:46.735,You see what you can accomplish when you're sober?
00:24:46.777,00:24:49.905,Sober? I'm rolling on a fistful of horse tranquilizers.
00:24:49.947,00:24:52.241,I can't feel my lips.
00:24:52.283,00:24:55.244,"Oh, you know..."
00:24:55.286,00:24:57.246,I think I'm going to keep these shoes.
00:24:59.790,00:25:01.167,April...
00:25:01.208,00:25:03.585,I brought you here because I need to talk to you.
00:25:05.587,00:25:09.507,I'm concerned that you're a bad influence on the glee club.
00:25:11.593,00:25:15.639,I can't have you around if you're going to continue to encourage them to make bad choices.
00:25:22.480,00:25:25.565,"Well, you're right, Will."
00:25:25.607,00:25:27.943,"As of right now, I'm back on the wagon."
00:25:27.985,00:25:30.696,Really?
00:25:32.823,00:25:34.825,That's great.
00:25:36.702,00:25:40.373,I have to tell you something.
00:25:40.414,00:25:42.624,I was in awe of you in high school.
00:25:49.631,00:25:51.008,getting the chance to sing with you.
00:25:51.050,00:25:53.427,Really?
00:25:53.469,00:25:55.471,"Yeah. I mean, that's how you get better, you know?"
00:25:55.513,00:25:57.597,Singing with people who are better than you.
00:25:57.639,00:25:59.933,You really thought that much of me?
00:26:04.646,00:26:06.690,You are the reason I joined Glee Club.
00:26:06.732,00:26:09.485,No...
00:26:12.654,00:26:13.613,Um...
00:26:13.655,00:26:16.616,"So, your dream was always to sing with me, huh?"
00:26:16.658,00:26:18.618,Yeah.
00:26:18.660,00:26:19.619,"Well, then, come on."
00:26:19.661,00:26:22.289,What?
00:26:31.673,00:26:33.633,"Shut your gravy hole, Barry."
00:26:33.675,00:26:36.554,"WILL: Hey, guys, uh, happy gambling."
00:26:36.594,00:26:37.595,Here we go.
00:28:05.767,00:28:09.396,This is really good pizza.
00:28:09.438,00:28:13.775,"Yeah. I think they import the pepperoni from, like, Michigan or something."
00:28:13.817,00:28:16.111,How's Glee?
00:28:16.153,00:28:18.656,"Oh, well, everybody misses you."
00:28:20.073,00:28:21.408,They miss my talent.
00:28:21.450,00:28:24.578,"No, no. We're your friends."
00:28:24.620,00:28:26.372,We just miss having you around.
00:28:28.499,00:28:30.125,"I love Glee, I just..."
00:28:33.795,00:28:35.047,I appreciate you.
00:28:41.303,00:28:43.180,It's your last ball.
00:28:49.395,00:28:52.481,"Just like the first time, but better."
00:29:12.834,00:29:14.753,Come back to Glee.
00:29:16.755,00:29:17.797,What about Quinn?
00:29:17.839,00:29:19.799,I don't know what's going to happen in the future.
00:29:19.841,00:29:22.052,I just know that I want to spend more time with you now.
00:29:22.886,00:29:25.472,I'll-I'll have to quit the play.
00:29:26.890,00:29:29.685,I'll do it!
00:29:45.784,00:29:48.495,Maybe Quinn is lactose intolerant.
00:29:48.537,00:29:49.829,That doesn't explain all the crying.
00:29:49.871,00:29:52.416,Maybe she just doesn't like the group.
00:29:52.458,00:29:53.667,Are you all that stupid?
00:29:53.709,00:29:55.419,Seriously?
00:29:55.461,00:29:58.838,I bet you thought Bert and Ernie were just roommates.
00:29:58.880,00:30:02.801,Maybe Quinn's got one in the oven.
00:30:05.178,00:30:06.513,Who's the baby's daddy?
00:30:06.555,00:30:08.807,Who do you think?
00:30:10.726,00:30:11.977,Finn.
00:30:13.562,00:30:17.857,"Yes, you've heard right-- I am returning to Glee Club."
00:30:17.899,00:30:21.861,"In lieu of flowers, please send all donations to a socially conscious charity of your choice."
00:30:21.903,00:30:23.863,This is a hot damn mess.
00:30:23.905,00:30:25.658,"MERCEDES: Oh, my God."
00:30:25.699,00:30:30.704,"Uh, I'm sorry; I thought I'd be welcomed back with a tad more enthusiasm."
00:30:30.746,00:30:33.415,"Sorry, Glee Club has just been rocked with its first scandal."
00:30:34.708,00:30:35.917,Quinn's knocked up.
00:30:35.959,00:30:39.672,And the baby daddy?
00:30:39.713,00:30:40.756,Finn.
00:30:46.762,00:30:50.557,I just wanted to drop off the application for that scholarship you were telling me about.
00:30:50.599,00:30:53.727,"I got Rachel to come back to Glee, so, I figure we have a real shot at it."
00:30:53.769,00:30:54.894,I'm so proud of you.
00:30:54.936,00:30:57.856,See what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it?
00:31:02.778,00:31:03.779,Finn!
00:31:04.946,00:31:06.615,You're a liar.
00:31:06.657,00:31:08.408,Why didn't you tell me Quinn was pregnant?
00:31:08.450,00:31:10.536,Who told you?
00:31:10.577,00:31:13.997,"I'm the only fool who went out with you and let you kiss me, thinking you actually had feelings for me."
00:31:14.039,00:31:16.958,But I-I do.
00:31:17.000,00:31:20.504,"Look, yeah, I haven't been totally honest with you, but that's different than lying."
00:31:20.546,00:31:23.549,"Well, maybe it's not that much different, but..."
00:31:23.590,00:31:33.642,"but look, I need to get a music scholarship, so I can go to college, so I can get a good job, so I can take care of my kid and I can't do that if you don't come back to Glee Club."
00:31:33.684,00:31:35.018,You should take it as a compliment.
00:31:35.060,00:31:37.855,You could have just been honest with me.
00:31:39.439,00:31:42.108,"Look, I know what I did was wrong."
00:31:42.150,00:31:44.986,"I get that, but..."
00:31:45.028,00:31:48.824,"Whatever it was, it ruined any chance of me ever coming back to Glee."
00:31:48.866,00:31:55.497,"I hope you have fun playing house with Quinn while you languish in your little ensemble, but my dreams are bigger than that and they're bigger than you."
00:32:00.001,00:32:00.960,Miss Sylvester.
00:32:01.002,00:32:02.962,We need to talk.
00:32:03.004,00:32:05.758,"If you'd like to to return to the musical, changes need to be made."
00:32:05.799,00:32:07.551,"Well, Rachel, I couldn't agree with you more."
00:32:07.593,00:32:15.267,"You know, when I heard Sandy wanted to write himself into a scene as Queen Cleopatra, I was aroused, then furious."
00:32:15.308,00:32:19.979,I hereby grant you complete artistic control.
00:32:20.021,00:32:21.690,"Congratulations, kiddo."
00:32:21.732,00:32:25.985,You now have everything you could possibly want.
00:32:26.027,00:32:27.946,Isn't it a great feeling?
00:32:42.335,00:32:44.922,The house is packed-- you guys are going to kick butt tonight.
00:32:46.840,00:32:48.967,I can't wait.
00:32:49.927,00:32:50.886,Where-Where's April?
00:32:50.928,00:32:52.178,Yee-haw!
00:32:52.220,00:32:54.347,"Right on cue, as usual."
00:32:55.682,00:32:57.726,"Hey, roller-boy. Handsome."
00:32:57.768,00:32:59.018,"Oh, I like that color."
00:32:59.060,00:33:01.688,"Have you been working on the, uh, moves we talked..."
00:33:01.730,00:33:02.731,"You've got something right there, on your..."
00:33:02.773,00:33:04.149,"Uh, oh..."
00:33:05.567,00:33:06.777,Honk!
00:33:08.069,00:33:10.489,There's my boy.
00:33:10.530,00:33:12.616,You promised me you'd sober up for this.
00:33:12.658,00:33:14.952,When? Last night?
00:33:14.993,00:33:17.370,"Well, I was drunk."
00:33:22.083,00:33:24.127,"Hit it, knuckles."
00:33:28.966,00:33:31.635,"April Rhodes almost ran me over in the parking lot just now, Will."
00:33:31.677,00:33:33.971,You can't let her go on in her condition.
00:33:39.726,00:33:43.814,Wow. It's really great how committed you are to these kids.
00:33:49.695,00:33:55.617,"EMCEE: Now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome McKinley High School's New Directions."
00:34:53.759,00:34:55.134,Whoo!
00:35:34.215,00:35:35.383,Whoo!
00:36:24.265,00:36:25.851,I need to talk to you.
00:36:25.892,00:36:28.436,Sorry. Baby had to tinkle.
00:36:28.478,00:36:30.689,"No, I can't let you go back out there."
00:36:30.730,00:36:33.191,You broke a promise.
00:36:35.152,00:36:36.235,You're right.
00:36:38.947,00:36:43.035,"It's a great moment for me, but it didn't feel right."
00:36:43.076,00:36:45.620,I don't belong up there.
00:36:45.662,00:36:52.460,"But everybody deserves their moment in the spotlight, you know, to shine?"
00:36:52.502,00:36:55.296,"Oh, I got that standing ovation, Will."
00:36:55.338,00:36:58.050,And it felt amazing.
00:36:58.091,00:37:02.261,Like every bad decision I'd ever made just went away.
00:37:02.303,00:37:04.347,I was back in the game.
00:37:04.389,00:37:09.978,But then I look over and I see these sweet faces of these kids and I think...
00:37:10.020,00:37:14.315,I'm hogging their sunshine.
00:37:14.357,00:37:16.234,"It's their turn now, not yours."
00:37:18.195,00:37:28.121,"They're so lucky to have you, Will, because you won't let what happened to me ever happen to any of them."
00:37:29.998,00:37:31.457,"So, where you gonna go?"
00:37:31.499,00:37:35.670,"Well, um..."
00:37:35.712,00:37:37.047,I'm going to straighten up.
00:37:38.715,00:37:42.677,Maybe try to find a new dream.
00:37:42.719,00:37:43.887,"You know, I always loved the Broadway."
00:37:43.929,00:37:45.972,The Broadway?
00:37:46.973,00:37:51.228,Do you think there's a part out there for a washed-up has-been like me?
00:37:51.269,00:37:53.939,"April, you are not washed-up."
00:37:55.190,00:37:57.734,"And hey, there's always Branson."
00:37:57.776,00:38:00.570,"Will, Will, Will."
00:38:02.781,00:38:04.365,Thank you.
00:38:06.367,00:38:07.493,"No, no, no."
00:38:07.535,00:38:09.662,Thank you.
00:38:15.376,00:38:17.295,"Branson, eh?"
00:38:28.098,00:38:30.558,They loved us!
00:38:30.600,00:38:32.518,Wh-Wh-Where's April?
00:38:32.560,00:38:34.020,"KURT: You were right, Mr. Shue."
00:38:34.062,00:38:36.355,She'd massacre Mariah in a diva-off.
00:38:36.397,00:38:40.359,April is amazing.
00:38:40.401,00:38:41.903,But she's not in the glee club anymore.
00:38:43.655,00:38:45.157,It...
00:38:45.198,00:38:47.159,"I, uh..."
00:38:47.200,00:38:49.452,I screwed up bringing her here.
00:38:49.494,00:38:53.081,It was about me and Glee Club is supposed to be about you guys.
00:38:53.123,00:38:55.250,You don't need her to be great.
00:38:55.292,00:38:57.376,But we need her for the second act.
00:38:57.418,00:39:00.588,I'll just have to go out there and tell them we had to cut the show short.
00:39:02.632,00:39:03.883,You were great.
00:39:04.676,00:39:06.552,Don't worry.
00:39:06.594,00:39:08.387,There will be other performances.
00:39:08.429,00:39:10.765,Excuse me?
00:39:10.807,00:39:12.350,I think I might have a solution.
00:39:13.601,00:39:17.647,"In show business, when a star can't perform, her understudy steps in."
00:39:19.107,00:39:21.400,"I'd be happy to go in for April, if you'd let me."
00:39:21.442,00:39:23.695,Since when are you willing to be an understudy?
00:39:23.736,00:39:25.655,Since I quit the play.
00:39:25.697,00:39:27.324,Really? Why?
00:39:29.909,00:39:33.371,I realized being a star didn't make me feel as special as being your friend.
00:39:35.290,00:39:40.879,"If I'd let you down when you needed me the most, I'd never forgive myself."
00:39:45.342,00:39:46.926,You don't know the choreography.
00:39:49.679,00:39:52.140,Then we're going to have to give her a lot of help out there.
00:39:58.771,00:40:00.690,Go get in your costume.
00:00:03.086,00:00:07.215,"Rachel and the Glee Club know that Quinn's pregnant, but they all think Finn's the father, when really it's Puck."
00:00:07.257,00:00:11.720,Yikes!And Terri's only fake pregnant and wants Quinn to give her her baby so Will won't find out.
00:00:11.762,00:00:13.263,How come you haven't had any morning sickness?
00:00:13.305,00:00:16.684,"Oh, and also, Ken is dating Emma, but she's really got eyes for Mr. Shue."
00:00:16.725,00:00:19.144,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:19.186,00:00:21.563,"Five, six, seven, eight."
00:00:19.186,00:00:23.899,"Step, turn, out, in, ball-change, step ball-change step."
00:00:23.941,00:00:25.484,"You, you, you, you."
00:00:25.526,00:00:27.987,And ba-ba-ba. Turn...
00:00:28.028,00:00:30.155,"Come on, guys, you're sleepwalking on me here."
00:00:32.115,00:00:34.660,"Please, Sectionals is going to be a breeze."
00:00:34.702,00:00:36.704,Maybe so.
00:00:36.745,00:00:41.124,"But if we coast through Sectionals, we're gonna get killed at Regionals."
00:00:46.630,00:00:48.089,Sorry.
00:00:48.131,00:00:49.591,It's the grape stomping one.
00:00:52.553,00:00:54.680,The kids have gotten really complacent.
00:00:54.722,00:00:56.557,It's like the fire has totally gone out.
00:00:56.598,00:00:59.727,"Um, um, I'm sorry, you've just, uh..."
00:00:59.768,00:01:05.106,you've got a little mustard in your cute Kirk Douglas chin dimple.
00:01:06.149,00:01:08.527,Wha...? Huh?
00:01:08.569,00:01:10.111,I get it?
00:01:10.153,00:01:11.530,Um...
00:01:11.572,00:01:13.114,"Here, let me."
00:01:13.156,00:01:14.783,Hold on.
00:01:16.159,00:01:18.245,There.
00:01:19.538,00:01:20.581,Thanks.
00:01:22.833,00:01:24.125,"Um, so..."
00:01:24.167,00:01:26.127,"Uh, when did... when did this start to happen?"
00:01:26.169,00:01:28.338,A week ago.
00:01:28.380,00:01:31.216,"RACHEL: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven..."
00:01:34.177,00:01:38.139,"Just got the competition bracket for Sectionals, and we are in really good shape."
00:01:38.181,00:01:39.182,There's only two other teams.
00:01:48.609,00:01:52.237,School for the Deaf in Dayton and someplace called Jane Addams Academy.
00:01:52.279,00:01:53.989,Jane Addams?
00:01:52.279,00:01:55.407,That's a halfway house for girls just getting out of juvie.
00:01:55.449,00:01:57.451,Th-th-this is great.
00:01:57.492,00:02:00.328,People who can't hear what they're singing and criminals who don't care.
00:02:00.370,00:02:01.872,It's gonna be a cakewalk.
00:02:01.914,00:02:03.415,High fi...
00:02:08.211,00:02:11.048,I've got to figure out some way to motivate them.
00:02:11.090,00:02:13.383,"Okay, well, you, um, you could..."
00:02:13.425,00:02:15.176,"Oh, what about a sticker board?"
00:02:15.218,00:02:18.179,That's how my parents got me to do chores when I was a kid.
00:02:18.221,00:02:21.475,"Right, so I'd do a chore and then I'd get a star, and then..."
00:02:21.516,00:02:23.769,"SUE: Oh, dear God, please, please..."
00:02:23.811,00:02:25.270,stop talking.
00:02:36.239,00:02:37.240,You know what this is?
00:02:37.282,00:02:39.493,It's a list of my Cheerios.
00:02:39.534,00:02:42.621,Every week I pick someone at random and I kick them out.
00:02:46.249,00:02:48.002,How's that working out for you?
00:02:54.341,00:02:56.259,It's like mother's milk to them.
00:02:56.301,00:03:00.514,"Without it, their bones won't grow properly."
00:03:00.555,00:03:05.477,"So if you want results with a kid, you find that competitive animal within and unleash it."
00:03:07.104,00:03:08.271,Okay.
00:03:08.313,00:03:10.315,"Ellen, that blouse is just insane."
00:03:15.278,00:03:18.115,I can't believe she's allowed to teach at this school.
00:03:18.157,00:03:20.408,You know...
00:03:20.450,00:03:22.452,she may have a point.
00:03:28.333,00:03:30.251,Competition.
00:03:30.293,00:03:34.297,Every one of these people or elements was a champion in their own right.
00:03:34.339,00:03:38.052,But they used competing with each other to make themselves even better.
00:03:38.093,00:03:42.263,I don't understand how lightning is in competition with an above-ground swimming pool.
00:03:44.307,00:03:45.433,You guys have become complacent.
00:03:45.475,00:03:51.065,"You were great at the invitational, but you got to up your game if you want to get through Sectionals."
00:03:51.106,00:03:52.566,"Okay, split up."
00:03:52.607,00:03:55.027,"Guys on the left side, girls on the right side."
00:04:04.327,00:04:05.579,Kurt.
00:04:12.794,00:04:14.295,Here's the deal.
00:04:14.337,00:04:16.090,Two teams-- boys versus girls.
00:04:16.131,00:04:21.136,"One week from today, you will each perform a mash-up of your choice."
00:04:21.178,00:04:22.512,What's a mash-up?
00:04:22.554,00:04:29.352,A mash-up is when you take two songs and mash them together to make an even richer explosion of musical expression.
00:04:29.394,00:04:31.312,"Boys will perform on Tuesday, girls the next day."
00:04:34.566,00:04:40.363,Whoever wins the competition gets to choose the number that we do for Sectionals.
00:04:40.405,00:04:41.823,"Wait, who's going to be the judge?"
00:04:41.865,00:04:44.325,Your gender makes you biased.
00:04:44.367,00:04:46.327,Ah...
00:04:46.369,00:04:49.206,There is going to be a celebrity judge.
00:04:50.582,00:04:53.710,"Oh, you're going to have to show up to find out."
00:04:53.752,00:04:55.837,We got this in the bag.
00:04:55.879,00:04:58.339,I'm going to start storyboarding our choreography tonight.
00:05:00.801,00:05:02.343,The girls look pretty pumped.
00:05:02.385,00:05:04.972,We're planning on smacking them down like the hand of God.
00:05:07.390,00:05:09.143,"Hey, Finn, you all right?"
00:05:09.184,00:05:11.352,You seem a little out of it.
00:05:15.398,00:05:17.442,We're late for football practice.
00:05:23.406,00:05:25.951,SUE: Dear Journal.
00:05:25.993,00:05:27.619,Feeling listless again today.
00:05:27.661,00:05:35.085,"It began at dawn when I tried making a smoothie out of beef bones, breaking my juicer."
00:05:35.127,00:05:38.588,And then at Cheerios practice-- disaster.
00:05:40.423,00:05:42.383,It was unmistakable.
00:05:42.425,00:05:46.596,It was like spotting the first spark on the Hindenburg: a quiver.
00:05:46.638,00:05:49.390,That quiver will lose us Nationals.
00:05:49.432,00:05:52.602,"And without a championship, I'll lose my endorsements."
00:05:52.644,00:05:56.898,"And without those endorsements, I won't be able to buy my hovercraft."
00:05:58.441,00:06:01.360,I'm just really tired from Glee Club.
00:06:06.533,00:06:14.415,"Every time I try to destroy that clutch of scab-eating, mouth-breathers, it only comes back stronger like some sexually ambiguous horror movie villain."
00:06:14.457,00:06:28.096,"Here I am, about to turn 30, and I've sacrificed everything only to be shanghaied by the the bi-curious machinations of a cabal of doughy, misshapen teens."
00:06:28.138,00:06:30.224,"Am I missing something, Journal?"
00:06:30.265,00:06:32.142,Is it me?
00:06:32.184,00:06:34.435,Of course it's not me.
00:06:34.477,00:06:36.437,It's Will Schuester.
00:06:36.479,00:06:38.439,"What is it about him, Journal?"
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.362,The store-bought home perm?
00:06:43.402,00:06:47.490,"You know, Journal, I noticed something yesterday."
00:06:49.159,00:06:51.161,...chin dimple.
00:06:51.203,00:06:53.454,SUE: it's coming clear to me now.
00:06:53.496,00:06:59.753,"If I can't destroy the club, I'll just have to destroy the man."
00:07:04.507,00:07:09.721,Your husband is hiding his kielbasa in a Hickory Farms gift basket that doesn't belong to you.
00:07:11.390,00:07:12.473,With who?
00:07:15.310,00:07:18.521,Wears creepy brooches like the kind my Nana was buried in.
00:07:18.563,00:07:19.398,More tea.
00:07:19.439,00:07:21.482,"Oh, sorry."
00:07:21.524,00:07:23.068,It's the same old song.
00:07:23.110,00:07:24.861,Wife puts on a couple extra pounds...
00:07:24.903,00:07:25.779,"Oh, I'm pregnant."
00:07:25.820,00:07:27.322,"Oh, that's no excuse."
00:07:27.364,00:07:31.492,I've always thought the desire to procreate showed deep personal weakness.
00:07:31.534,00:07:33.912,Me-- never wanted kids.
00:07:37.540,00:07:39.500,Are you sure about this?
00:07:39.542,00:07:41.378,A woman always knows.
00:07:42.545,00:07:48.509,"Let me put it to you this way-- if it's not a full-blown affair, well, it's certainly heading in that direction."
00:07:48.551,00:07:52.764,You need a machete to cut through the haze of lust that surrounds them.
00:07:52.806,00:07:55.350,"Oh, God, what am I going to do?!"
00:07:55.392,00:07:57.602,I think you should both pack up and move out of the district.
00:07:58.812,00:08:03.733,Unless you want to lose your man to a mentally ill ginger Pygmy with eyes like a bush baby.
00:08:03.775,00:08:05.735,Now you're absolutely sure about this?
00:08:05.777,00:08:07.154,"I mean, you have proof?"
00:08:07.195,00:08:11.616,Get into that school and sniff out those sex pheromones for yourself.
00:08:11.658,00:08:13.534,We happen to have an opening.
00:08:13.576,00:08:16.537,"Our school nurse, Mrs. Lancaster, is in a coma."
00:08:16.579,00:08:19.791,"Oh, she took a terrible tumble down the stairwell yesterday."
00:08:24.629,00:08:27.007,But I'm not a nurse.
00:08:27.048,00:08:28.549,I work at Sheets N' Things.
00:08:28.591,00:08:29.550,I'm not an American citizen.
00:08:29.592,00:08:31.552,I was born in the Panama Canal Zone.
00:08:31.594,00:08:33.554,But I managed to get a passport.
00:08:33.596,00:08:34.931,I've run for office twice.
00:08:41.104,00:08:44.858,...get creative.
00:08:44.899,00:08:49.446,"Mrs. Schuester, I appreciate your interest in the nursing position."
00:08:49.488,00:08:52.824,But your previous experience is limited to folding hand towels.
00:08:52.866,00:08:56.744,"As assistant manager at Sheets N' Things, I've had first aid training."
00:08:56.786,00:08:58.163,Mm-hmm.
00:08:58.205,00:09:00.581,I've also used a defibrillator.
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.459,Hmm.
00:09:03.543,00:09:05.586,So what did you want to talk to me about?
00:09:05.628,00:09:07.422,"Oh, good news."
00:09:07.464,00:09:09.590,I figured out a way to get the kids motivated.
00:09:09.632,00:09:12.593,They're going to compete against each other in a glee-off.
00:09:12.635,00:09:15.596,Oh.
00:09:15.638,00:09:16.973,You.
00:09:17.015,00:09:18.475,Me?
00:09:18.517,00:09:24.605,You are the most honest and impartial person I know.
00:09:26.649,00:09:29.610,"Well, isn't this a surprise."
00:09:31.488,00:09:33.532,Hi. I don't think we've been properly introduced.
00:09:33.573,00:09:35.616,"I'm Terri Schuester, Will's pregnant wife."
00:09:35.658,00:09:37.035,Hi.
00:09:37.077,00:09:41.289,"Oh, honey, someone got a little lipstick on your cup."
00:09:43.375,00:09:45.126,I got it.
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.673,"Um, is everything okay, Terri?"
00:09:50.715,00:09:52.551,You-you never visit me at work.
00:09:52.592,00:09:53.968,"Oh, I'm not visiting."
00:09:55.178,00:09:56.513,No.
00:09:56.555,00:10:01.601,"You've been so stressed about our finances lately, that I thought I would pitch in by getting a second job."
00:10:04.312,00:10:05.522,I'm the new school nurse.
00:10:05.564,00:10:07.648,But you're not a nurse.
00:10:07.690,00:10:09.109,You don't have any training.
00:10:09.150,00:10:10.151,"Oh, please, Will."
00:10:10.193,00:10:12.779,It's a public school.
00:10:14.364,00:10:15.740,Isn't this going to be great?
00:10:15.782,00:10:19.494,And this means that I'm going to be around all the time now.
00:10:28.587,00:10:30.130,Know your routes.
00:10:30.171,00:10:32.882,"Now that is the key to this play, gentlemen."
00:10:32.924,00:10:37.929,"The receivers run the fly route downfield and then block as the play develops, okay?"
00:10:37.971,00:10:40.765,Know your assignments.
00:10:40.807,00:10:42.601,FINN: I'm losing it.
00:10:42.642,00:10:44.685,I'm tired all the time.
00:10:44.727,00:10:45.770,I can't keep my eyes open.
00:10:45.812,00:10:49.608,That's your only job is to know your assignments.
00:10:49.649,00:10:50.900,WILL: No sharps and no flats.
00:10:50.942,00:10:52.693,FINN: I know how lucky I am.
00:10:52.735,00:10:55.363,"Captain of the football team, Glee stud."
00:10:55.405,00:10:56.864,I know I should be excited about Quinn.
00:10:56.906,00:11:02.996,"She's hot, popular, and she's carrying my baby and all, but I can't get Rachel out of my head."
00:11:03.037,00:11:08.627,"She kind of freaks me out in a Swimfan kind of way, but she can really sing and her body is smoking..."
00:11:08.668,00:11:10.753,if you're not into boobs.
00:11:10.795,00:11:12.547,My body's a mess.
00:11:12.589,00:11:19.012,"I found a hair on my ear the other day, and I have to rub Biofreeze on my shins a couple times a day-- growing pains."
00:11:19.053,00:11:23.891,"It smells pretty bad, but I mask it with Drakkar Noir."
00:11:23.933,00:11:26.561,Being a guy my age is tough.
00:11:26.603,00:11:30.731,"Between Glee and football and school and being popular, I'm just kind of overwhelmed."
00:11:30.773,00:11:34.444,"Everyone wants something from me, and I don't have the energy to do it all."
00:11:34.486,00:11:38.948,I don't know how important people like presidents or newscasters or mob bosses do it.
00:11:38.990,00:11:43.370,"My mom says I'm stretched too thin, so I gave up homework, but that didn't help."
00:11:43.411,00:11:45.913,All I know is last night I got vaporized on level two.
00:11:45.955,00:11:47.748,Level two.
00:11:47.790,00:11:50.793,And I didn't even have the energy to care.
00:11:50.835,00:11:52.837,He's drooling.
00:11:52.879,00:11:55.840,"Dude, wake up."
00:11:55.882,00:11:57.758,"Sure, yeah, that sounds good."
00:11:57.800,00:11:59.969,I said we can't let those girls beat us.
00:12:00.011,00:12:04.683,"Sorry. Sometimes when I'm thinking real hard, it helps to close my eyes."
00:12:04.723,00:12:07.768,We're doing a mash-up of It's My Life and Usher's Confessions.
00:12:07.810,00:12:10.605,get some trash can lids and Stomp the Yard up in this piece.
00:12:13.816,00:12:14.859,Dude.
00:12:14.901,00:12:16.069,What's wrong with you?
00:12:16.110,00:12:17.404,Go see the nurse.
00:12:17.445,00:12:18.779,Every day I say I have a headache.
00:12:18.821,00:12:19.947,I sleep for three hours.
00:12:24.911,00:12:26.829,"Thanks, guys."
00:12:26.871,00:12:29.708,Keep up the good work.
00:12:36.256,00:12:38.799,"Okay, girls, we need to get started."
00:12:38.841,00:12:39.884,We're getting warmed up.
00:12:39.926,00:12:42.178,Where's Quinn?
00:12:42.220,00:12:44.805,Probably down at the mall looking for elastic-waist pants.
00:12:47.850,00:12:50.853,"Mr. Shuester's right, you guys."
00:12:50.895,00:12:52.689,We can't get complacent.
00:12:52.731,00:12:54.274,Chill out.
00:12:54.315,00:12:56.610,We're gonna do a mash-up of Halo and Walking on Sunshine.
00:12:56.651,00:12:58.319,That was my idea.
00:12:58.361,00:12:59.529,Whatever.
00:13:01.864,00:13:04.492,You think those six dudes are gonna give us any competition?
00:13:05.868,00:13:07.870,We can't just wing it.
00:13:07.912,00:13:10.831,All those in favor of winging it?
00:13:10.873,00:13:11.874,All those opposed?
00:13:13.376,00:13:16.546,Looks like the ayes have it.
00:13:24.929,00:13:26.347,Hi. How can I help you?
00:13:26.389,00:13:28.558,"Hey, Mrs. Shuester."
00:13:28.600,00:13:30.143,I'm Finn Hudson.
00:13:30.184,00:13:32.646,"Oh, hi, Finn."
00:13:32.687,00:13:34.939,Are you the one who's dating Quinn Fabray?
00:13:34.981,00:13:36.857,Yeah. Why?
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.859,"Oh, you have really good bone structure."
00:13:38.901,00:13:44.865,"Yeah, um, I've been really tired lately, and I was wondering if I could lie down in here for a while."
00:13:44.907,00:13:46.825,Why don't you have a seat?
00:13:47.910,00:13:51.289,Why don't you tell me a little bit about your sleep habits?
00:13:51.331,00:13:52.373,What time do you go to bed?
00:13:52.415,00:13:53.874,"Um, I don't know."
00:13:53.916,00:13:56.877,"Usually, after Skinemax starts playing regular movies again."
00:14:01.924,00:14:03.718,It's like my brain won't shut up.
00:14:03.760,00:14:04.843,"Well, what are you thinking about?"
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.807,"Oh, you can be honest with me."
00:14:08.847,00:14:10.891,There's a code of silence in my office.
00:14:10.933,00:14:15.146,"Okay, uh, football plays..."
00:14:15.188,00:14:16.481,Uh-huh.
00:14:16.523,00:14:21.569,"...um, girls, dance steps... girls."
00:14:21.611,00:14:24.071,Girls? But you're dating Quinn Fabray.
00:14:24.113,00:14:26.032,"Yeah, but..."
00:14:28.409,00:14:31.329,Do you think a guy can be into two girls at once?
00:14:31.371,00:14:32.913,No.
00:14:32.955,00:14:34.499,"And remember, flirting is cheating."
00:14:34.541,00:14:37.043,And the revenge of the jilted woman is usually pretty messy.
00:14:37.960,00:14:39.838,So can I take my nap now?
00:14:39.879,00:14:41.715,"Do you want to sleep through your life, Finn?"
00:14:41.756,00:14:45.760,"No, but I read once that teenagers need more sleep than infants."
00:14:56.396,00:14:58.648,Wow.
00:14:58.690,00:15:01.651,I don't even know how I did that.
00:15:01.693,00:15:04.987,Wait a minute.
00:15:06.614,00:15:08.575,Pseudoephedrine.
00:15:08.616,00:15:11.202,It's the stuff they put in decongestants to make them non-drowsy.
00:15:11.244,00:15:13.663,It's kind of like a...
00:15:13.705,00:15:20.002,I would pop two of these blue meanies every morning and then I would be a firecracker for the rest of the day.
00:15:22.004,00:15:24.965,They stock them next to the candy bars.
00:15:27.051,00:15:28.928,I know what I'm doing.
00:15:34.517,00:15:36.227,"Hey, guys, how's it going?"
00:15:36.269,00:15:38.020,"God, it's a beautiful day."
00:15:38.062,00:15:39.146,Let's run through the number.
00:15:39.188,00:15:40.481,I can't wait to do the number.
00:15:40.523,00:15:41.482,I'm ready and excited.
00:15:41.524,00:15:42.983,Are you guys?
00:15:43.025,00:15:44.611,Let's get this joint jumping.
00:15:44.652,00:15:47.196,Has your soul been taken over by caffeinated space aliens?
00:15:47.238,00:15:49.240,"No, just visited the school nurse."
00:15:49.282,00:15:51.409,Got this great vitamin.
00:15:51.451,00:15:52.993,I can't wait to do the number.
00:15:53.035,00:15:56.497,"Let's do the number, and then afterwards, we can build a house for Habitat for Humanity."
00:15:56.539,00:15:57.665,What kind of vitamin?
00:15:57.707,00:15:58.999,Vitamin C?
00:16:02.044,00:16:03.838,Vitamin D.
00:16:03.880,00:16:05.214,And I got you guys some.
00:17:59.787,00:18:01.372,"Awesome, guys."
00:18:01.414,00:18:03.041,"Geez, I didn't know you had it in you."
00:18:03.082,00:18:05.418,It's like somebody slipped something in your juice boxes.
00:18:05.459,00:18:07.127,Whoo!
00:18:08.170,00:18:12.842,"Otherwise, we've got our opening number for Sectionals!"
00:18:18.222,00:18:19.098,Okay!
00:18:34.405,00:18:37.075,Haven't seen you at Glee rehearsals.
00:18:37.116,00:18:39.535,I'm not Superwoman.
00:18:39.577,00:18:45.625,"I know Glee is your whole life, but I have the Cheerios, I'm on honor roll, I have friends."
00:18:45.666,00:18:48.168,You don't have to be embarrassed.
00:18:48.210,00:18:50.922,No one at Glee is gonna judge you.
00:18:53.466,00:18:59.430,"Look, I know everyone expects us to be enemies and be in competition, but I don't hate you."
00:19:03.225,00:19:07.939,That was before you knew what it felt like to be me; an outsider.
00:19:09.231,00:19:12.693,"More people are gonna start finding out about this, and you're gonna need friends who can relate."
00:19:12.735,00:19:14.862,How can you relate to what I'm going through?
00:19:14.904,00:19:20.076,You don't think people whisper about me in the lunchrooms or draw pornographic pictures of me on the bathroom walls?
00:19:20.118,00:19:24.204,"That was me, actually."
00:19:24.246,00:19:28.835,"Look, I don't agree with the choice you're making, but you're gonna need Glee."
00:19:28.876,00:19:31.378,You have seven months of your youth left.
00:19:31.420,00:19:32.672,You should enjoy it.
00:19:38.260,00:19:41.221,Just come back to practice.
00:19:41.263,00:19:43.141,Boys versus girls.
00:19:43.182,00:19:45.225,And we could certainly use your voice right now.
00:19:45.267,00:19:46.268,"You're actually a good singer, Quinn."
00:19:51.273,00:19:56.236,"I would have tortured you if the roles were reversed, you know?"
00:19:56.278,00:19:57.571,I know.
00:20:08.207,00:20:10.084,Hi. It's Terri.
00:20:10.126,00:20:12.753,"Hi, Terri."
00:20:12.795,00:20:15.255,"Yeah, I know that, Howard."
00:20:15.297,00:20:17.717,"Okay, you know how I'm moonlighting as a nurse?"
00:20:17.758,00:20:19.259,"Well, I need a favor."
00:20:19.301,00:20:20.511,O-Okay.
00:20:20.553,00:20:23.764,Go to the drugstore and get me a couple of boxes of decongestant.
00:20:23.806,00:20:27.185,"I'm running low, and I want the children at McKinley to be healthy and happy."
00:20:30.312,00:20:32.272,thirty-six.
00:20:39.363,00:20:40.740,"Hey, Terri."
00:20:40.781,00:20:43.201,"Oh, hi, Ken."
00:20:48.164,00:20:49.707,Can we talk frank?
00:20:49.749,00:20:52.001,Uh...
00:20:52.043,00:20:54.294,Listen...
00:20:56.380,00:20:58.298,I think my girlfriend is in love with your husband.
00:20:58.340,00:21:00.384,And I wouldn't be surprised if the feeling was mutual.
00:21:02.344,00:21:03.888,I don't know.
00:21:03.930,00:21:06.182,"I see them together all the time laughing, talking..."
00:21:06.224,00:21:07.808,All the stuff she never does with me.
00:21:09.351,00:21:12.939,She couldn't keep her eyes off him at those Acafella clown shows.
00:21:12.980,00:21:16.316,"Listen, has Will ever mentioned it to you?"
00:21:16.358,00:21:17.818,"Oh, no, but he's too smart for that."
00:21:17.860,00:21:20.154,"I mean, just barely, but still."
00:21:20.196,00:21:22.115,"Oh, Ken, I got to be honest with you."
00:21:22.156,00:21:25.325,I only took this job so that I could keep an eye on him.
00:21:25.367,00:21:29.538,We've got to put a stop to this so that I can get out of here.
00:21:29.580,00:21:32.208,"See, I'm not built to work five days a week."
00:21:32.250,00:21:38.297,"Well, I've been thinking maybe that if you and I started seeing each other on the side, it might kind of cancel their thing out."
00:21:40.299,00:21:41.801,Are you two still having sex?
00:21:41.842,00:21:44.428,"Because, you know, when that stops, something is up."
00:21:44.470,00:21:48.224,"We actually haven't, um... had sex yet."
00:21:48.266,00:21:50.601,She doesn't like to be touched.
00:21:50.643,00:21:52.728,By me.
00:21:52.770,00:21:54.563,Oh.
00:21:54.605,00:21:58.734,"God, I love her so much."
00:22:01.403,00:22:02.404,Okay.
00:22:03.656,00:22:06.366,It's okay.
00:22:08.410,00:22:09.787,Look at the two of us.
00:22:11.289,00:22:13.791,"You pregnant, and me with psoriasis Oh."
00:22:13.833,00:22:15.835,and one testicle that won't descend.
00:22:18.420,00:22:19.379,"Okay, that's enough."
00:22:19.421,00:22:22.175,You know what? You got to stop being such a baby.
00:22:22.216,00:22:23.759,I cannot fix this unless you are willing to man up.
00:22:23.801,00:22:25.385,Okay. I'm sorry.
00:22:27.429,00:22:30.557,you're going to do.
00:22:30.599,00:22:34.520,You're going straight to the nearest department store to buy her an engagement ring.
00:22:35.938,00:22:41.068,Then you're going to get down on one knee and you're going to ask that doe-eyed little harlot to marry you.
00:22:41.110,00:22:44.404,No. I can't do that.
00:22:44.446,00:22:46.032,What if she says no?
00:22:46.073,00:22:47.325,It might kill me.
00:22:53.706,00:22:55.373,Then nothing can stop you.
00:22:58.961,00:23:00.296,I told you guys.
00:23:00.338,00:23:01.588,We know.
00:23:04.466,00:23:06.219,Were they really that good?
00:23:06.260,00:23:09.138,"They were, Quinn."
00:23:10.931,00:23:12.641,But we underestimated the boys.
00:23:12.683,00:23:15.477,"Their number will go to Sectionals and once again, I will be humiliated."
00:23:15.519,00:23:17.437,How were we supposed to know they'd rock the house?
00:23:17.479,00:23:19.315,They've never been good.
00:23:19.357,00:23:20.440,How did they d-d-do it?
00:23:23.903,00:23:27.323,"Though I've been grouped with the boys, my allegiance still remains with you ladies."
00:23:27.365,00:23:35.331,They declined my offer to do their hair in cornrows and all my artistic decisions have been derided as too costly because they involve several varieties of exotic bird feathers.
00:23:36.414,00:23:38.416,We all took something.
00:23:47.009,00:23:49.762,"My man, got next week's plays all worked out."
00:23:49.803,00:23:53.391,"Yeah. Hey, Mr. Shue, got that paper on Bariloche, Argentina on your desk."
00:23:53.431,00:23:54.558,But it's not due for two weeks.
00:23:54.600,00:23:56.476,Damn straight.
00:23:56.518,00:23:57.686,Cheater.
00:23:57.728,00:23:59.521,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:24:01.523,00:24:02.566,Kurt told me.
00:24:02.608,00:24:06.486,"It's deplorable, contemptible, and it's just plain wrong."
00:24:06.528,00:24:08.155,It's also cheating.
00:24:06.528,00:24:09.656,"As a matter of fact, I'm going to start calling you F-Rod."
00:24:09.698,00:24:11.491,"Hey, hey, back off. I'm nothing like A-Rod, okay?"
00:24:11.533,00:24:12.868,I'd never take steroids.
00:24:12.910,00:24:14.494,They make your junk fall off.
00:24:14.536,00:24:18.082,"Listen, Rachel, you don't know what it's like for me, the kind of pressure I'm under."
00:24:20.542,00:24:24.088,"The natural way, with a rigorous diet and exercise routine."
00:24:26.715,00:24:29.509,RACHEL: I'm up at 6:00 a.m. every day.
00:24:29.551,00:24:35.515,"I have my protein shake with banana and flaxseed oil, and by 6:10, I'm on the elliptical."
00:24:35.557,00:24:37.559,You know how I motivate myself?
00:24:37.601,00:24:38.811,Not with anything artificial.
00:24:38.852,00:24:43.316,I set a goal and I won't rest until I reach it.
00:24:43.357,00:24:45.234,"Yeah, well, that's personal pressure."
00:24:45.276,00:24:46.902,"If you don't meet your goal, you're the only one who loses."
00:24:46.944,00:24:57.621,"I have to be the quarterback, the male lead, and deal with a pregnant girlfriend who yells at me about ice cream, so, yeah, maybe I helped me and my teammates out a little bit, but it's only because I'm sick and tired of working so hard and still losing."
00:24:57.663,00:24:59.539,"Yeah, but winning by cheating isn't winning."
00:24:59.581,00:25:00.540,"Oh, don't give me that."
00:25:00.582,00:25:03.794,The only reason you're so pissed about this is 'cause you know you can't compete with us.
00:25:03.836,00:25:05.712,"Oh, I am offended by that accusation."
00:25:05.754,00:25:09.175,"We haven't performed yet, but if I may say, our mash-up is spectacular."
00:25:09.216,00:25:10.550,Still isn't going to be as good.
00:25:10.592,00:25:12.594,We're gonna win.
00:25:12.636,00:25:14.512,Deal with it.
00:25:19.059,00:25:21.479,Everyone gets a dose.
00:25:21.519,00:25:23.563,"Oh, except for Quinn."
00:25:23.605,00:25:25.399,Mama.
00:25:25.441,00:25:27.026,It's good for the baby.
00:25:29.778,00:25:31.071,"Get the lead out, Howard."
00:25:31.113,00:25:32.698,We have patients waiting.
00:25:33.866,00:25:36.576,Are you sure we should be doing this?
00:25:36.618,00:25:39.288,"Oh, it's over-the- counter. It's safe."
00:25:39.330,00:25:40.747,You can trust me.
00:25:40.789,00:25:42.291,I'm a nurse.
00:25:42.333,00:25:44.335,It's good for you.
00:25:57.097,00:25:58.432,What's up with Ken?
00:25:58.474,00:26:00.017,Doesn't he have a healthy glow?
00:26:00.059,00:26:01.894,I put him on a new vitamin regimen.
00:26:01.935,00:26:03.645,Is that safe?
00:26:03.687,00:26:05.439,"I mean, you're not really a nurse, Terri."
00:26:05.481,00:26:07.024,"Don't start criticizing my work, Will."
00:26:07.066,00:26:09.651,Not when I'm just getting my sea legs.
00:26:15.657,00:26:17.451,Isn't this nice?
00:26:17.493,00:26:21.497,"I mean, when is the last time we got to have lunch together on a weekday?"
00:26:24.124,00:26:26.626,Just...
00:26:26.668,00:26:28.837,"Geez, Terri."
00:26:28.879,00:26:31.424,This is my workplace.
00:26:31.465,00:26:33.842,It's just that my hormones are going really crazy for you.
00:26:33.884,00:26:35.261,"Hey, look, look."
00:26:35.302,00:26:39.348,You being here is not good for our marriage.
00:26:39.390,00:26:42.560,Spending time together is not good for our marriage?
00:26:42.600,00:26:44.061,Not every minute.
00:26:44.103,00:26:45.645,There's no separation.
00:26:45.687,00:26:48.815,"I mean, we used to come home every night and talk about our day."
00:26:48.857,00:26:51.693,Now we have nothing to say to each other.
00:26:51.735,00:26:55.072,A lot of ants on the sidewalk today.
00:26:59.910,00:27:01.912,Pretty late in the season for that.
00:27:03.705,00:27:07.042,I think this is just forcing us to expand our intellectual horizons.
00:27:08.710,00:27:10.129,Where are you going?
00:27:10.170,00:27:11.629,I'll come with you.
00:27:12.714,00:27:15.717,"I love you, but I need my space."
00:27:19.805,00:27:21.932,Mmm.
00:27:26.395,00:27:27.687,"Now's your chance, Ken."
00:27:27.729,00:27:29.815,"What, here? Now?"
00:27:32.401,00:27:34.361,"Hi, Emma."
00:27:35.571,00:27:36.947,What are you doing?
00:27:36.989,00:27:41.701,"Look, Emma, I know our relationship hasn't been perfect-- you won't ride in my car, I can't touch you above the wrist."
00:27:41.743,00:27:45.747,"Remember, you cried for an hour that one time my elbow accidentally brushed by your breast?"
00:27:45.789,00:27:47.583,But I think about you all day long.
00:27:47.625,00:27:51.462,I kiss that picture of us at the state fair every night before I go to sleep.
00:27:52.754,00:27:54.006,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:27:54.047,00:27:55.591,This isn't happening.
00:27:55.633,00:27:58.344,"Emma Pillsbury, this is not an engagement ring."
00:27:58.385,00:27:59.719,"Oh, thank goodness."
00:27:59.761,00:28:02.722,But it's more than that. It's a promise.
00:28:02.764,00:28:06.519,"Look, Emma, I know you have this thing about being clean."
00:28:06.560,00:28:17.946,"Now, I can't promise to pick up my underwear or squeegee the shower door, but I can promise to keep your life clean of sadness and loneliness and any other dark clouds that might float into it."
00:28:21.450,00:28:23.327,It's cubic zirconia.
00:28:23.369,00:28:26.455,I know how affected you were by Black Diamond.
00:28:26.497,00:28:29.958,"Emma Pillsbury, Eminem..."
00:28:30.000,00:28:31.709,will you marry me?
00:28:38.050,00:28:39.677,Thank you so much.
00:28:39.718,00:28:50.145,"While the boys chose a selection of songs that cast an eye inward on the irresponsible life choices and sexual hunger of today's modern teens, we have chosen a selection of songs that speaks to the nation as a whole during these troubling times filled with economic uncertainty and unbridled social woe."
00:28:50.187,00:28:54.483,"Because if there's two things America needs right now, that is sunshine and optimism."
00:28:55.442,00:28:57.277,Also angels.
00:29:00.614,00:29:02.282,Okay.
00:30:41.548,00:30:43.467,Whoo!
00:30:45.803,00:30:47.304,"Ladies, I-I don't even know what to say."
00:30:47.346,00:30:50.349,You did such a good job.
00:30:50.390,00:30:53.185,"I don't know what you guys did, but whatever it was, keep doing it."
00:30:53.226,00:30:55.562,Our celebrity judge has her work cut out for her.
00:30:57.939,00:30:59.441,"Hey, great job, guys."
00:31:00.400,00:31:02.194,Okay! All right.
00:31:05.572,00:31:07.491,Ha!
00:31:07.533,00:31:09.535,"Hey, Emma, um..."
00:31:09.576,00:31:10.910,Can you walk with me?
00:31:10.952,00:31:12.746,Yeah.
00:31:14.790,00:31:17.167,"I think your, uh... I think your plan worked."
00:31:17.209,00:31:18.918,Yeah.
00:31:18.960,00:31:22.589,"Instilling a sense of good, clean competition in these kids, I think, um..."
00:31:22.631,00:31:24.216,I think you really motivated them.
00:31:24.257,00:31:26.926,"Well, actually, I consider you a co-conspirator."
00:31:26.968,00:31:29.596,We came up with the idea together.
00:31:29.638,00:31:31.931,So...
00:31:31.973,00:31:34.727,Is it true about Ken asking to marry you?
00:31:34.768,00:31:36.936,Yeah.
00:31:36.978,00:31:38.355,"Yeah, it is."
00:31:42.150,00:31:44.862,I don't know.
00:31:44.903,00:31:47.197,"Can you, um..."
00:31:47.239,00:31:49.991,can you think of any other options I might have?
00:31:53.787,00:31:56.456,Is... Is that a reason to marry someone?
00:31:58.375,00:31:59.959,That's not what I'm asking.
00:32:12.013,00:32:13.932,Emma.
00:32:14.933,00:32:16.976,Terri.
00:32:17.018,00:32:18.978,"Um, how are you?"
00:32:19.020,00:32:20.856,"What can I, uh..."
00:32:20.898,00:32:23.275,What can I...
00:32:24.484,00:32:26.570,I just wanted to cut to the chase.
00:32:26.612,00:32:30.282,Things have been a little awkward since I started working here.
00:32:36.037,00:32:38.206,You have no chance with my husband.
00:32:38.248,00:32:39.374,Do I make myself clear?
00:32:39.416,00:32:45.964,"Oh, you might think there's some kind of competition going on between you and I, but that's like saying that a nail is competing with a hammer."
00:32:48.842,00:32:50.594,"Terri, Will is a good man."
00:32:50.636,00:32:51.595,Uh-huh.
00:32:51.637,00:32:55.849,He's kind and he's generous...
00:32:55.891,00:32:58.059,and he deserves a lot better than you.
00:32:58.101,00:33:01.897,"Emma, Will is my husband."
00:33:05.066,00:33:09.279,You are so superior because you're nice to a man that you see for an hour or two a day.
00:33:09.321,00:33:13.617,You're just an innocent little dove. Hmm?
00:33:13.659,00:33:18.413,You're so innocent that you would steal a man away from his pregnant wife.
00:33:18.455,00:33:19.414,Yeah.
00:33:19.456,00:33:21.458,"Do yourself a favor, honey."
00:33:24.127,00:33:33.470,"Oh, sure, he's dumb like sand, and his fondue pot of nationalities is gonna open your kids up to a host of genetic diseases, but he's kind and he's generous."
00:33:33.512,00:33:36.389,And he's available.
00:33:53.573,00:33:54.366,Mrs. Schuester.
00:33:54.407,00:33:55.367,Mm-hmm?
00:33:55.408,00:33:57.369,I need to talk to you...
00:33:57.410,00:33:58.704,about the baby.
00:33:58.745,00:34:00.079,Is everything okay?
00:34:00.121,00:34:02.123,"Wait, you're not having it right now, are you?"
00:34:02.165,00:34:03.166,What? No!
00:34:03.208,00:34:05.084,Aren't you supposed to be a nurse?
00:34:05.126,00:34:06.044,Mm-hmm.
00:34:09.756,00:34:11.675,I've been thinking about your offer.
00:34:11.717,00:34:13.092,Yeah?
00:34:13.134,00:34:15.512,I like my life.
00:34:15.554,00:34:18.557,I like being a cheerleader.
00:34:18.598,00:34:24.354,"And I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but I really like being in Glee Club."
00:34:24.396,00:34:31.194,"I have all of these great things in my life, and it already feels like too much."
00:34:31.236,00:34:33.739,I can't raise a baby.
00:34:37.200,00:34:40.579,"You know, honestly, I don't even know how you kids do it nowadays."
00:34:40.620,00:34:44.332,I didn't have it this bad when I was your age.
00:34:44.374,00:34:46.585,"There weren't as many TV channels either, though."
00:34:48.045,00:34:49.421,Is Finn okay with this?
00:34:49.462,00:34:52.966,"'Cause, you know, I don't want any baby daddy drama when you hand it over to me."
00:34:53.008,00:34:56.135,He's the reason I'm doing this.
00:34:56.177,00:35:00.724,"He's such a good guy, and he internalizes all this pressure."
00:35:00.766,00:35:02.267,He's gonna have a heart attack.
00:35:03.894,00:35:07.522,"I never want Mr. Schuester to find out about this, though."
00:35:07.564,00:35:09.524,"I don't want to hurt him, either."
00:35:09.566,00:35:11.610,"Well, your secret's safe with me."
00:35:11.651,00:35:14.153,I have a lot more to lose.
00:35:14.195,00:35:16.448,One more thing.
00:35:16.489,00:35:19.409,You know how you gave me those vitamins for the baby?
00:35:19.451,00:35:20.368,Mm-hmm.
00:35:20.410,00:35:28.167,"I really appreciated that, but I'm gonna have all these doctor's bills, and I'm gonna need some new maternity clothes."
00:35:28.209,00:35:29.544,You want money from me?
00:35:29.586,00:35:31.421,It's gonna be your baby.
00:35:33.632,00:35:35.425,I think you can handle nine months.
00:35:35.467,00:35:38.470,"Look, you're making the right call here, Quinn."
00:35:38.511,00:35:40.722,It's what's best for everybody.
00:35:55.528,00:35:57.238,Hi.
00:36:01.451,00:36:03.202,Hi.
00:36:03.244,00:36:09.626,"Um, I can't... I can't stay long in this room because of the germs, you know, and because of the odor."
00:36:11.461,00:36:13.588,But I have a question.
00:36:13.630,00:36:16.883,"Anything for you, Emma."
00:36:18.677,00:36:21.638,"So what would, um..."
00:36:21.680,00:36:25.600,what would getting married mean exactly?
00:36:25.642,00:36:29.228,Because I would want to keep my last name.
00:36:29.270,00:36:37.946,"And I'd want to continue living in different parts of town, and, um, I think it would be best if we didn't see each other after school."
00:36:37.988,00:36:40.073,Sure.
00:36:40.115,00:36:44.494,"And I wouldn't want a big ceremony, you know, like in a church with people."
00:36:44.536,00:36:47.497,"We wouldn't have to invite anybody, you know, or tell anybody, actually."
00:36:47.539,00:36:50.542,"It could be more like a secret, you know, like a secret marriage."
00:36:50.583,00:36:53.712,That's actually a better deal than I expected.
00:36:54.671,00:36:57.549,"You're a really good man, Ken."
00:36:58.508,00:37:07.225,"And I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone, and I know that you don't either."
00:37:14.357,00:37:15.984,is that a yes?
00:37:21.740,00:37:23.658,"What's up, A-Rage?"
00:37:23.700,00:37:26.369,"Hey, sweet mash-up."
00:37:26.411,00:37:30.289,We were just taking a lesson from major league baseball.
00:37:30.331,00:37:31.708,It's not cheating if everyone's doing it.
00:37:31.750,00:37:33.668,We were just leveling out the playing field.
00:37:33.710,00:37:35.294,You really believe that?
00:37:37.797,00:37:38.924,No.
00:37:38.965,00:37:40.592,I feel terrible.
00:37:40.633,00:37:43.302,"Even if we win, it's not gonna be satisfying."
00:37:43.344,00:37:44.303,I know.
00:37:44.345,00:37:46.305,I don't even remember performing.
00:37:46.347,00:37:47.891,What do you think we should do?
00:37:47.933,00:37:53.688,I think... the only way to make things right is to just withdraw from the competition.
00:37:53.730,00:37:58.235,"You know, admit that we were wrong and disqualify our respective teams immediately."
00:37:58.276,00:37:59.318,No one gets to win.
00:37:59.360,00:38:01.821,Cool.
00:38:05.158,00:38:06.952,I'm sorry about what I said the other day.
00:38:06.993,00:38:09.495,About calling you contemptible and deplorable.
00:38:09.537,00:38:10.956,"Ah, that's all right."
00:38:10.997,00:38:13.125,I didn't even know what those words meant.
00:38:13.166,00:38:19.338,"What I meant to say is that I guess I get caught up in the competitive hysteria, too."
00:38:19.380,00:38:21.507,My goals are too selfish.
00:38:34.646,00:38:37.440,What the hell were you thinking?
00:38:37.482,00:38:39.358,You gave drugs to my students?
00:38:39.400,00:38:40.986,I'll say it again.
00:38:41.027,00:38:42.737,"They're over-the-counter, FDA-approved."
00:38:42.779,00:38:46.532,"And if I didn't give it to them, I'm sure the kids would just find a way to get it for themselves."
00:38:46.574,00:38:47.617,"No, no, they wouldn't."
00:38:47.659,00:38:48.743,These are good kids.
00:38:48.785,00:38:50.369,Nothing bad happened.
00:38:50.411,00:38:52.371,Howard Bamboo got arrested.
00:38:55.416,00:38:56.459,"Well, that."
00:38:56.501,00:38:58.170,Wait. What?
00:39:01.673,00:39:06.052,Howard got picked up by the Feds on suspicion of running a crystal meth lab.
00:39:06.094,00:39:08.429,I never told Howard to get them all in one place.
00:39:08.471,00:39:10.640,"Okay, enough, Terri."
00:39:10.682,00:39:16.229,How are we supposed to raise a baby when I can't trust you to look after a group of teenagers?
00:39:16.271,00:39:18.231,You are oblivious to consequences.
00:39:18.273,00:39:19.899,"I was only trying to help you, Will."
00:39:19.941,00:39:21.234,Don't!
00:39:22.694,00:39:30.243,"Every time I light a fire in my life, you find a way to make sure it burns the forest down."
00:39:32.287,00:39:35.790,"FIGGINS: I have serious concerns about your judgment, Mrs. Schuester."
00:39:35.832,00:39:38.417,I must ask you to resign as school nurse.
00:39:38.459,00:39:40.712,Fine.
00:39:40.753,00:39:43.381,I was working too hard anyway.
00:39:45.258,00:39:46.676,"Hold onto your horses, Shue."
00:39:46.718,00:39:49.804,I have to question your judgment in the matter as well.
00:39:52.473,00:39:53.474,Exactly.
00:39:53.516,00:39:56.811,The children rely on you to create the culture.
00:39:56.853,00:40:03.693,"And you, with your obsession with winning and-and competition, has fostered an unsafe environment."
00:40:03.735,00:40:08.031,I'm bringing in someone else to co-chair the Glee Club.
00:40:08.073,00:40:12.410,Someone with a track record of responsibility and excellence.
00:40:14.495,00:40:16.706,"We're really sorry, Mr. Shue."
00:40:16.748,00:40:18.624,We didn't mean to get you into trouble.
00:40:18.666,00:40:23.713,I'm really disappointed in you guys.
00:40:23.755,00:40:27.675,"Glee is supposed to be about what's inside your heart, not what's coursing through your veins."
00:40:33.514,00:40:35.683,"Well, it's not that simple."
00:40:35.725,00:40:40.521,"Because of this debacle, it's been decided that I'm no longer fit to run Glee Club myself."
00:40:40.563,00:40:44.317,We've been assigned a co-director.
00:40:44.359,00:40:46.278,Who?
00:40:46.319,00:40:47.486,"Hey, kids."
00:40:47.528,00:40:56.746,"I got to tell you, I'm just thrilled to be coming on board to co-captain your little, uh, showbiz cruise."
00:40:56.788,00:41:01.000,"Ah, I can't wait to start singing and dancing and maybe even putting on the ritz a little bit."
00:41:06.547,00:41:09.134,Will?
00:41:15.932,00:41:18.935,"I wanted you to, um, to hear this from me."
00:41:20.145,00:41:23.982,"You know Ken, um, asked me to marry him."
00:41:25.358,00:41:27.652,I said yes.
00:41:30.571,00:41:32.615,That's...
00:41:34.575,00:41:36.035,That's great.
00:00:01.669,00:00:07.424,"So, here's what you missed last week: Quinn's pregnant and Puck's the father, but Quinn's decided to give the baby to Terri, who's not pregnant, just pretending to be."
00:00:07.466,00:00:08.634,It was her sister Kendra's idea.
00:00:08.676,00:00:10.427,We're gonna have to get you a baby.
00:00:10.469,00:00:12.680,"Also, Ken proposed to Emma, and she said..."
00:00:12.721,00:00:16.433,"Oh, and Sue got Figgins to make her co-director of the Glee Club."
00:00:16.475,00:00:18.519,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:20.020,00:00:22.147,Hey!
00:00:26.777,00:00:28.863,How did this happen?
00:00:30.113,00:00:31.490,That's not me.
00:00:31.532,00:00:35.703,"Wow, I didn't know the vein on my neck could stick out like that."
00:00:35.744,00:00:41.082,We've been going at it for a week-- ever since the decongestant incident when Figgins brought Sue in to co-run the Glee Club.
00:00:41.124,00:00:43.460,I'm so ashamed of myself.
00:00:43.502,00:00:45.086,She's turned me into her.
00:00:48.131,00:00:50.009,Look at me.
00:00:50.049,00:00:55.806,"Even in the heat of battle I'm so elegant, regal."
00:00:55.848,00:00:59.518,"I am Ajax, mighty Greek warrior."
00:00:59.560,00:01:04.189,"God, it feels good to finally pop that zit known as Will Schuester."
00:01:04.231,00:01:07.275,Look at us: we're even fighting in our voiceovers.
00:01:14.157,00:01:18.996,"Sue, Shue, I called you here to get the temperature of the Glee Club."
00:01:20.163,00:01:24.292,I wanted to get a progress report on how you're working together as co-directors.
00:01:24.334,00:01:25.961,"Well, in my opinion..."
00:01:26.003,00:01:26.962,"No, go ahead."
00:01:27.004,00:01:27.922,Okay.
00:01:27.963,00:01:29.048,"Principal Figgins, uh..."
00:01:29.088,00:01:31.508,things couldn't be going more smoothly.
00:01:31.550,00:01:33.134,I couldn't agree more.
00:01:37.973,00:01:44.980,I don't want to hear any reports of either of you trying to curry favor from the children.
00:01:45.022,00:01:46.065,Am I clear?
00:01:46.105,00:01:48.358,Absolutely.
00:01:48.400,00:01:53.154,"As we head into Sectionals, I want to get some feedback, like what kind of stuff you guys would like to be doing."
00:01:53.196,00:01:56.992,"Is there anything, any music in particular, that you guys want to do?"
00:01:57.034,00:01:59.995,Could we maybe try something a little more... black?
00:02:00.037,00:02:02.081,KURT: I agree.
00:02:02.122,00:02:03.999,We do an awful lot of show tunes.
00:02:04.041,00:02:06.001,It's Glee Club.
00:02:06.043,00:02:07.795,Don't make me take you to the carpet.
00:02:07.836,00:02:08.921,Fantastic.
00:02:08.963,00:02:11.172,"Thank you, Mercedes, Kurt."
00:02:11.214,00:02:12.549,Duly noted.
00:02:12.591,00:02:13.592,Anything else?
00:02:13.634,00:02:14.802,I can pop and lock.
00:02:14.843,00:02:20.181,"Not really what we're going for, Mike, but... noted."
00:02:20.223,00:02:21.182,"Noted, yes."
00:02:21.224,00:02:22.977,And no pitting the kids against one another.
00:02:23.018,00:02:24.185,Never.
00:02:24.227,00:02:27.982,"I want to pit these kids against one another, am I clear?"
00:02:28.023,00:02:29.190,"Quinn, update. Go."
00:02:29.232,00:02:33.070,The minority students don't feel like they're being heard.
00:02:33.112,00:02:34.696,"Hmm, a chink in the armor, huh?"
00:02:34.738,00:02:42.579,"I am going to create an environment that is so toxic, no one will want to be a part of that club."
00:02:42.621,00:02:52.006,Like the time I sold my house to a nice young couple and I salted the earth in the backyard so that nothing living could grow there for a hundred years.
00:02:52.047,00:02:53.381,You know why I did that?
00:02:53.423,00:02:57.845,Because they tried to get me to pay their closing costs.
00:02:57.886,00:03:00.055,Sectionals is coming up.
00:03:00.097,00:03:02.223,What are your co-director plans?
00:03:02.265,00:03:03.809,"Oh, we were actually..."
00:03:03.851,00:03:05.811,"uh, we're each going to direct our own number."
00:03:05.853,00:03:07.896,And we'll be flipping a coin to see who goes first.
00:03:07.938,00:03:11.232,"It'll be very civilized, very sportsmanlike, so..."
00:03:11.274,00:03:14.402,This arrangement is pleasing to all.
00:03:14.444,00:03:15.904,Isn't it?
00:03:15.946,00:03:17.114,Now...
00:03:17.156,00:03:18.239,let's hug it out.
00:03:21.660,00:03:22.536,I'd rather not do that.
00:03:22.577,00:03:24.038,I really don't see that happening.
00:03:24.079,00:03:26.289,This meeting doesn't end until I see your bodies touching.
00:03:26.331,00:03:29.960,It's a technique I learned last week at my leadership seminar.
00:03:38.093,00:03:39.260,I will destroy you.
00:03:39.302,00:03:41.722,I'm about to vomit down your back.
00:03:41.763,00:03:43.223,It's on.
00:03:51.314,00:03:53.108,I'm freaking out.
00:03:54.317,00:03:57.571,"Relax. At your age, there's very little chance of anything being wrong."
00:03:57.612,00:03:59.280,Awesome.
00:03:59.322,00:04:02.201,"Okay, this is going to be a little cool to the touch."
00:04:02.242,00:04:04.411,Can you just be careful with my uniform?
00:04:05.204,00:04:06.663,All right.
00:04:06.705,00:04:11.085,"Speaking of your ages, have you two given any thought to what you're going to do after the baby is born?"
00:04:11.126,00:04:14.337,Whatever Quinn wants is fine.
00:04:14.379,00:04:18.299,"Well, if it makes a difference, it's a girl."
00:04:34.274,00:04:35.609,Hey.
00:04:38.361,00:04:40.321,Baby's fine.
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.365,Not even any cool ones.
00:04:46.369,00:04:48.329,I was too freaked out to drive.
00:04:48.371,00:04:50.498,"Yeah, no problem."
00:04:50.540,00:04:52.333,Hey.
00:04:52.375,00:04:55.503,You doing all right?
00:04:57.256,00:04:59.382,"Um, no."
00:05:00.634,00:05:03.344,"I mean, how am I supposed to take care of a real person?"
00:05:05.013,00:05:08.934,I-I thought Quinn wanted to give the baby up for adoption.
00:05:08.976,00:05:12.479,"For now, but we both know that's not my call."
00:05:13.897,00:05:16.275,It sucks.
00:05:16.316,00:05:19.987,Get all the stress and worry and none of the control.
00:05:23.282,00:05:25.033,"It's cool, Mr. Shue."
00:05:25.075,00:05:27.327,You wouldn't understand.
00:05:37.462,00:05:43.051,The independent polling company in my Dockers has determined you're the hottest girl in this school.
00:05:43.093,00:05:43.969,Ew.
00:05:44.011,00:05:45.386,Have you been reading my blog?
00:05:45.428,00:05:47.388,Of course not.
00:05:45.428,00:05:50.892,"You're a gossip monger and your blog is nothing but trash and lies, many of them about me."
00:05:50.934,00:05:56.773,"Well, you'll be happy to know the one I'm working on right now has nothing to do with you or your rumored lust for Jewfros."
00:05:56.815,00:05:58.192,It's about Quinn Fabray.
00:05:58.233,00:06:00.194,Word on the street is that she's in trouble.
00:06:00.235,00:06:02.112,Where did you hear that?
00:06:02.154,00:06:03.404,Are you denying it?
00:06:03.446,00:06:04.656,Yes.
00:06:04.698,00:06:11.412,Because the same birdie told me you're heartbroken Finn Hudson didn't choose you to carry his litter.
00:06:17.836,00:06:21.298,What is it going to take for you to not run the story?
00:06:21.340,00:06:23.591,Lady's choice. Heads.
00:06:23.633,00:06:25.426,Trickster's Trick Store?
00:06:25.468,00:06:27.386,You got any of these double-headed coins?
00:06:29.056,00:06:30.389,Heads.
00:06:30.849,00:06:32.433,Awesome.
00:06:32.475,00:06:37.647,"All right, the following students have been selected for a special, elite Glee Club called Sue's Kids."
00:06:37.689,00:06:39.858,Hold on. We agreed not to split up the group.
00:06:39.900,00:06:41.360,"Oh, come on, Will."
00:06:41.400,00:06:43.820,Give me a chance to do things Sue Sylvester's way.
00:06:43.862,00:06:49.034,"Maybe with my proven leadership abilities, I can help this pathetic group of mouth breathers place at Sectionals."
00:06:49.076,00:06:52.120,"WILL: We can't even compete in Sectionals if we divide up the club, Sue."
00:06:52.162,00:06:53.330,It's against the rules.
00:06:53.372,00:06:55.332,"Really? You need to crack open a book, William."
00:06:55.374,00:06:56.666,"Here, I have."
00:06:56.708,00:06:58.459,"Show Choir Rule Book, page 24."
00:06:58.501,00:07:01.462,"Provision 14, second addendum."
00:07:04.507,00:07:08.427,"However, not all members must perform every song."
00:07:11.681,00:07:12.807,Fine.
00:07:17.104,00:07:18.980,"All right, everybody, listen up."
00:07:19.022,00:07:22.276,"When you hear your name called, cross over to my side of this black shiny thing."
00:07:22.317,00:07:24.194,"That's called a piano, Sue."
00:07:28.156,00:07:29.449,Come on. Move it.
00:07:30.533,00:07:36.581,"Asian, other Asian, Aretha, and Shaft."
00:07:37.791,00:07:41.502,"See, Will, I don't want to participate in a group that ignores the needs of minority students."
00:07:41.544,00:07:43.380,You have got to be kidding me.
00:07:46.549,00:07:49.177,Bigotry is no laughing matter.
00:07:49.219,00:07:51.721,And that's how Sue sees it.
00:07:51.763,00:07:54.474,Outstanding.
00:07:59.146,00:08:04.359,I wanted to remind you to tell that Quinn girl not to vaccinate in the hospital.
00:08:04.401,00:08:07.404,I'm pretty sure those shots made my kids stupid.
00:08:07.446,00:08:12.617,"Oh, I guess I could use the vaccination money to buy the organic crib mattress."
00:08:12.659,00:08:15.787,"I mean, what are the getting polio, right?"
00:08:15.829,00:08:17.538,"Bye, Kendra."
00:08:17.580,00:08:19.124,"I hate you, Will!"
00:08:19.166,00:08:20.334,That was rude.
00:08:20.375,00:08:22.543,Don't take the stress of your workday out on me.
00:08:24.045,00:08:26.714,I just don't want to feel as powerless in my own home as I do at school.
00:08:26.756,00:08:32.262,And I have to come home and listen to you making major decisions about our son with your sister.
00:08:32.304,00:08:38.559,"I haven't even felt the baby kick yet, and the only time I've ever been to an OB-GYN office was when I took Quinn and Finn for the ten-week ultrasound."
00:08:38.601,00:08:40.228,You did?
00:08:40.270,00:08:41.938,How's the baby?
00:08:41.980,00:08:43.190,Fine. It's a girl.
00:08:43.231,00:08:44.441,But that's not the point.
00:08:44.483,00:08:46.567,"Well, what is the point, Will?"
00:08:46.609,00:08:51.490,My point is that I am the father of that baby.
00:08:56.203,00:09:00.499,And I am coming with you to your next doctor's appointment.
00:09:07.422,00:09:09.466,So what did you have to do to get him to stop?
00:09:15.263,00:09:16.431,"Oh, hardcore."
00:09:17.432,00:09:19.184,I did it to protect you.
00:09:19.226,00:09:21.061,And Quinn.
00:09:21.102,00:09:23.063,Yeah.
00:09:23.104,00:09:26.566,"Hey, I got to tell you, you really are awesome."
00:09:27.650,00:09:30.278,"I'm gonna make it up to you someday, I swear."
00:09:34.282,00:09:35.658,I need another pair.
00:09:35.700,00:09:38.245,What's wrong with the ones I already gave you?
00:09:38.286,00:09:39.204,Look...
00:09:39.246,00:09:41.622,"Uh, they still had the tag on them."
00:09:41.664,00:09:44.584,Put those away.
00:09:45.668,00:09:50.424,"Okay, I expect delivery by tomorrow morning or the story of Quinn Fabray and the stork goes wide."
00:09:50.465,00:09:52.342,I feel an urge to kiss you right now.
00:09:55.678,00:09:56.637,Stop it.
00:09:56.679,00:09:58.515,Okay.
00:10:03.061,00:10:04.645,I'm ki-kind of nervous.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.356,I debated not even showing up.
00:10:06.398,00:10:07.732,"Well, I think it's gonna be great."
00:10:07.774,00:10:09.817,Did you catch Sue's Corner last night?
00:10:14.322,00:10:15.656,"Well, I'll tell you why."
00:10:15.698,00:10:20.537,Because I know firsthand how hard it is to struggle as a minority in America today.
00:10:20.579,00:10:22.663,I'm 1/16th Comanche Indian.
00:10:22.705,00:10:27.835,"In fact, I like minorities so much, I'm thinking of moving to California to become one."
00:10:30.338,00:10:32.673,Thought maybe they could help us out a little bit.
00:10:32.715,00:10:40.557,"Okay, so I selected a song that I think will speak to the frustration you felt under the failed leadership of Will Schuester."
00:10:40.599,00:10:44.311,"Hate on Me, an R&amp;B song?"
00:10:44.352,00:10:45.270,You like that?
00:10:46.729,00:10:51.692,"Changster, I want to see some of that pop-and-lock groove you're so famous for."
00:10:51.734,00:10:55.280,"And you, Mercedes, I want to see some Mariah hands."
00:10:55.322,00:10:56.615,MERCEDES: I can do that.
00:10:56.656,00:10:57.824,Yeah!
00:10:57.865,00:10:59.993,"I think we g-g-got this one, Miss Sylvester."
00:11:00.034,00:11:02.662,"All right, w-we'll see. Hit it!"
00:13:04.534,00:13:05.535,Sue.
00:13:05.577,00:13:06.827,"Hey, Sylvester, I'm talking to you."
00:13:06.869,00:13:08.538,"Oh, hey, buddy."
00:13:13.876,00:13:15.836,You are undermining me in front of these students.
00:13:15.878,00:13:21.884,Your delusions of persecution are a telltale sign of early stage paranoid schizophrenia.
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.261,"Sue, I am not done talking to you."
00:13:23.303,00:13:25.096,What about all my sheet music?
00:13:30.351,00:13:32.228,"Oh, so, what? You sent it away for some testing?"
00:13:32.270,00:13:33.480,No. Burned it.
00:13:33.521,00:13:35.856,"Oh, that is it, Sue."
00:13:35.898,00:13:39.152,A cockfight. Fantastic.
00:13:39.193,00:13:43.657,"No. We are here for these students so, whatever problems we have with one another, we're going to get them out in the open right now."
00:13:43.698,00:13:45.032,"Okay, you want to get real?"
00:13:45.074,00:13:50.288,"You're right, Will, I have been trying to destroy your club with a conviction I can only call religious."
00:13:50.330,00:13:51.539,And you want to know why?
00:13:51.581,00:13:53.916,Because I don't trust a man with curly hair.
00:13:53.958,00:14:00.381,"I can't help picturing small birds laying sulfurous eggs in there, and I find it disgusting."
00:14:00.423,00:14:03.134,"Oh, you are a terrible influence on these kids."
00:14:03.176,00:14:05.303,I think you're dangerous and I think you teach them all the wrong lessons.
00:14:05.345,00:14:06.554,I don't care what you think.
00:14:06.596,00:14:11.726,"I have a legacy to protect, William, and Glee Club is a part of that legacy, and I will win."
00:14:11.768,00:14:14.895,And if it means I have to get you fired to do it...
00:14:14.937,00:14:16.147,so be it.
00:14:16.189,00:14:17.856,Those drinks are crap!
00:14:33.540,00:14:35.916,"Oh, thanks, honey."
00:14:35.958,00:14:38.919,I want to finish grading these papers first.
00:14:38.961,00:14:41.088,"What, you think the kids weren't drunk when they wrote them?"
00:14:41.130,00:14:43.383,Hmm?
00:14:43.424,00:14:46.010,"Listen, honey."
00:14:46.052,00:14:47.970,I've been a really crummy wife lately.
00:14:51.224,00:14:53.560,I have no right to expect anything more than that from you.
00:14:53.601,00:14:56.730,No. That is my sister's marriage and I don't want it.
00:14:56.771,00:14:58.939,"Anyway, listen."
00:14:58.981,00:15:00.316,Okay.
00:15:00.358,00:15:03.944,I think that I might be able to help you with your problems at school.
00:15:03.986,00:15:10.159,"Uh, thanks, Terri, but the last time you helped out at school, it didn't go over very well."
00:15:10.201,00:15:11.952,But...
00:15:15.998,00:15:18.334,"I mean, Sue said she wouldn't rest until she saw me fired."
00:15:18.376,00:15:20.127,"Well, all the more reason."
00:15:20.169,00:15:21.796,"You got to do whatever it takes, honey."
00:15:23.590,00:15:27.968,You got to get down in the gutter if you want to win this.
00:15:29.888,00:15:32.348,"Sue, a lot of our readers at Cheerleading Today..."
00:15:32.390,00:15:34.225,I'm cutting you off.
00:15:34.267,00:15:35.560,Yes.
00:15:35.602,00:15:36.977,This is all your readers need to know.
00:15:37.019,00:15:38.979,I'm all about empowerment.
00:15:37.019,00:15:43.610,"I empower my Cheerios to live in a state of constant fear by creating an environment of irrational, random terror."
00:15:43.651,00:15:48.281,Speaking of which...
00:15:48.322,00:15:49.824,Where are my Cheerios?
00:15:52.660,00:15:54.954,Mr. Schuester flunked them.
00:16:03.045,00:16:04.589,This is a travesty of international proportions.
00:16:04.631,00:16:07.467,You are jeopardizing my Cheerios' role as goodwill ambassadors.
00:16:09.427,00:16:16.016,"Sue, I have in my hand a Spanish quiz in which one of your cheerleaders misspelled her name and answered every question with a drawing of a sombrero."
00:16:16.058,00:16:17.894,You can't stand it.
00:16:16.058,00:16:19.395,You can't stand to see a woman in a position of power.
00:16:19.437,00:16:24.734,"Your psychosexual derangement would be fascinating, Will, if it weren't so terrifying!"
00:16:31.073,00:16:32.617,"Oh, so what?"
00:16:32.659,00:16:38.205,"Why, only last Friday at the football game, they tried to spell out Go, team and they spelled out..."
00:16:38.247,00:16:39.624,To game.
00:16:39.666,00:16:47.632,"Since 1992, 95% of your Cheerios should have flunked Spanish, and I, for one, am not going to be a part of it anymore."
00:16:47.674,00:16:51.135,"Oh, Will, we all know about your devotion to that dying language."
00:16:51.177,00:16:53.053,Dying language?
00:16:54.514,00:16:57.057,I empower my Cheerios to be champions.
00:16:57.099,00:16:59.769,Do they go on to college?
00:16:59.811,00:17:01.437,See...
00:17:01.479,00:17:04.064,"Sure, if they want to become dishwashers and gardeners."
00:17:04.106,00:17:14.742,"But if they want to be bankers and lawyers and captains of industry, the most important lesson they could possibly learn is how to do a round-off."
00:17:14.784,00:17:16.452,She is deranged!
00:17:16.494,00:17:18.454,You know what? This all happened on your watch.
00:17:21.916,00:17:23.960,Say something!
00:17:24.002,00:17:26.337,"Oh, Ple... Oh, okay."
00:17:26.379,00:17:27.254,You're wrong.
00:17:27.296,00:17:28.255,What?
00:17:28.297,00:17:29.966,"From now on, no free passes."
00:17:30.008,00:17:31.050,That's it!
00:17:32.760,00:17:33.594,There!
00:17:33.636,00:17:34.762,"See you in Glee Club, Sue."
00:17:34.804,00:17:36.931,Don't... touch me.
00:17:38.016,00:17:39.350,"That is a lawsuit, mister."
00:17:39.392,00:17:42.520,I will sue your ass!
00:17:44.230,00:17:45.899,"What happened to our little agreement, huh?"
00:17:45.940,00:17:50.110,Will I be uploading a certain video to YouTube this afternoon?
00:17:50.152,00:17:52.697,Anti-embolism stockings can be purchased...
00:17:52.739,00:17:54.114,"Oh, Sue."
00:17:54.156,00:17:55.491,I put it on YouTube myself.
00:17:55.533,00:17:56.993,And it only got two hits.
00:17:57.035,00:17:58.160,Damn...
00:17:58.202,00:17:59.913,Let me break it down for you.
00:17:59.954,00:18:01.748,Nobody cares!
00:18:11.465,00:18:13.968,No! Not the children!
00:18:23.352,00:18:25.521,What is this?
00:18:25.563,00:18:28.524,I came up with a name that I think would be good for the kid.
00:18:28.566,00:18:33.153,"Eyes on your own test, Finn."
00:18:33.195,00:18:35.573,"What's up now, Ronnie?"
00:18:36.866,00:18:42.997,"Anyway, then I read that Gwyneth Paltrow named her kid Apple, and I think that's so cool 'cause you know how much I love apples, right?"
00:18:48.210,00:18:51.631,Then I came up with the best baby name of all time.
00:18:51.672,00:18:53.841,Drizzle!
00:19:03.225,00:19:04.852,Are you a moron?
00:19:04.894,00:19:07.187,We're not naming our baby Drizzle.
00:19:07.229,00:19:09.356,We're not naming our baby anything.
00:19:09.398,00:19:11.109,"Finish your test, Finn."
00:19:11.818,00:19:14.194,Will you give me my test back?
00:19:14.236,00:19:15.905,I just don't understand anything.
00:19:15.947,00:19:17.197,That's not my problem.
00:19:17.239,00:19:19.199,You are so insensitive.
00:19:19.241,00:19:22.411,Bringing up baby names to me when you know I don't want to keep it.
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.206,"I know, but I don't get what you expect me to do about it."
00:19:26.248,00:19:27.583,Not have an opinion.
00:19:27.625,00:19:29.251,"Hey, this is happening to me, too."
00:19:29.293,00:19:31.087,"No, it's not."
00:19:31.129,00:19:35.842,You're not the one whose parents will burn her like a witch if they find out.
00:19:35.883,00:19:38.552,"You know, sometimes I wish you were a little more like Rachel."
00:19:40.346,00:19:41.388,Really?
00:19:41.430,00:19:43.223,Yeah. She cares about my feelings.
00:19:43.265,00:19:44.433,She sticks up for me.
00:19:46.310,00:19:51.065,You know that she gave that Jacob kid a pair of her underpants just to keep him from posting on his blog about you being pregnant?
00:19:56.278,00:19:57.446,Just to be a good teammate?
00:19:57.488,00:19:59.032,Yeah. That's what she told me.
00:19:59.073,00:20:03.285,I know some guys cheat on their wives or pregnant girlfriends.
00:20:03.327,00:20:06.706,Just don't do it with her.
00:20:09.542,00:20:10.918,Whoo!
00:21:10.352,00:21:11.979,I miss us all being together.
00:21:12.021,00:21:14.356,I hope we don't get in trouble for our covert jam session.
00:21:15.649,00:21:17.317,"If Sue catches us mingling, we're cooked."
00:21:17.359,00:21:21.321,She told me if I even talked to one of Mr. Shue's kids that she would shave my head.
00:21:21.363,00:21:23.323,And I just can't rock that look.
00:21:23.365,00:21:25.701,"I mean, even Justin Timberlake is growing his 'fro back."
00:21:26.827,00:21:28.037,"Well, we got to go, you guys."
00:21:28.079,00:21:31.331,Miss Sylvester is expecting us in ten minutes in the dance studio.
00:21:31.373,00:21:33.333,"Aww, man."
00:21:33.375,00:21:34.627,Bye.
00:21:34.668,00:21:37.337,"Bye, white people."
00:21:37.379,00:21:39.339,Hey! What are you guys doing here?
00:21:39.381,00:21:41.550,Just s-s-stopping by to say hello.
00:21:41.592,00:21:44.011,"Oh, it's great to see you guys."
00:21:44.053,00:21:46.139,Bye!
00:21:46.180,00:21:47.514,"All right, great news, guys."
00:21:47.556,00:21:51.518,"Brought the band with me, and I think that we have our number for Sectionals."
00:21:51.560,00:21:56.065,"Mr. Shue, we don't like what this has become."
00:21:57.399,00:21:59.819,That is how Sue wants you to feel.
00:21:59.860,00:22:01.403,Giving up doesn't help anyone but her.
00:22:01.445,00:22:06.826,"Look, if it were up to me we would all perform together at Sectionals, but it's not up to me anymore, okay?"
00:22:06.867,00:22:10.370,"Sue's going to do her song, and we are gonna do ours."
00:22:19.421,00:22:23.383,"All right, Finn and Rachel, come up here; you're gonna take the leads."
00:22:23.425,00:22:25.178,"Oh, I love this song!"
00:22:25.219,00:22:26.304,"Okay, follow my lead."
00:22:26.344,00:22:28.430,Don't wait for me.
00:22:30.808,00:22:33.393,"Guys, you guys really need to practice this, all right?"
00:22:33.435,00:22:36.396,"Night and day, between classes, it has to be letter-perfect."
00:22:36.438,00:22:37.439,Okay?
00:22:37.481,00:22:38.607,Of course.
00:24:39.561,00:24:41.105,"Amazing, guys."
00:24:41.147,00:24:42.356,Bull's-eye.
00:24:42.398,00:24:44.608,Excuse me. What about us?
00:24:44.650,00:24:47.527,You expect us to just sway back here like props?
00:24:47.569,00:24:49.529,Say it for me again.
00:24:49.571,00:24:51.115,What about us?
00:24:51.157,00:24:53.742,You expect us to just sway back here like props?
00:24:53.784,00:24:54.701,Perfect.
00:24:54.743,00:24:56.203,Then turn to the other two and say...
00:24:56.245,00:24:58.372,I think Sue was right about him.
00:24:58.414,00:25:03.461,He clearly doesn't like minorities.
00:25:03.501,00:25:08.548,"Can you imagine, in this day and age, being discriminated against?"
00:25:08.590,00:25:11.718,"My goodness, the pain you must be feeling."
00:25:11.760,00:25:13.804,"So, your last name's Puckerman, huh?"
00:25:13.846,00:25:14.972,Shalom.
00:25:15.014,00:25:17.350,Who knew?
00:25:17.391,00:25:20.186,"And poor, sweet Brittany."
00:25:20.227,00:25:29.153,"Oh, I know the Dutch are famous for being a cold people, but that's no excuse for treating you like some half-price hooker in Amsterdam's famous red light district."
00:25:29.195,00:25:39.205,"Well, all I can say is if you're serious about leaving Schuester, Sue Sylvester's rainbow tent will gladly protect you from his storm of racism."
00:25:47.254,00:25:48.881,"WILL: Hey, babe, you home?"
00:25:52.426,00:25:53.677,"Hey, what's for dinner?"
00:25:53.719,00:25:55.513,Why don't you get something from takeout...?
00:25:55.553,00:26:03.479,"Hey, listen, I don't expect you to start cooking, but on nights when you're home first, I think it's appropriate for you to take care of dinner."
00:26:03.521,00:26:06.023,"Wow, you're so forceful."
00:26:06.065,00:26:07.400,What's gotten into you?
00:26:07.441,00:26:09.609,You.
00:26:09.651,00:26:10.694,You were right.
00:26:10.736,00:26:14.614,"I stood up to Sue, and now she is begging me for mercy."
00:26:14.656,00:26:17.701,"Oh, I feel great!"
00:26:22.164,00:26:24.624,You're going to have another one this Friday at 4:00.
00:26:29.671,00:26:31.465,My obstetrician?
00:26:31.507,00:26:32.632,Yep.
00:26:32.674,00:26:33.884,Oh.
00:26:33.926,00:26:35.969,I'm finally going to get a look at my little boy.
00:26:38.097,00:26:41.559,"Hey, pick whatever you want for dinner."
00:26:42.351,00:26:44.602,Just not Chinese again.
00:26:55.281,00:26:57.657,Who do you think you are?
00:26:57.699,00:27:02.662,"Well, now you know how it felt for me to have my Cheerios snatched away."
00:27:02.704,00:27:05.040,Not with that attitude.
00:27:05.082,00:27:07.709,"Look, I'm prepared to cut you a deal."
00:27:07.751,00:27:13.631,"You pass my Cheerios, and I'll give you back your team of losers and snot-faucets."
00:27:15.801,00:27:22.266,"Sue Sylvester, you're going to have to pry those Fs from my cold, dead hands."
00:27:22.308,00:27:25.643,"Can't wait, pal!"
00:27:27.729,00:27:30.107,My job is very stressful.
00:27:30.149,00:27:35.737,"After dentists, obstetricians have the highest rate of suicide among medical professionals."
00:27:35.779,00:27:38.324,Caring for my bonsai relaxes me.
00:27:38.365,00:27:41.619,I had a huge crush on the Karate Kid when I was a teenager.
00:27:41.659,00:27:42.744,KENDRA: Can we cut the crap?
00:27:42.786,00:27:46.123,I guess I'm a little curious as to what you ladies want from me.
00:27:46.165,00:27:47.707,Neither of you are pregnant.
00:27:47.749,00:27:51.504,"Well, Wu, you delivered all three of my kids."
00:27:51.545,00:27:53.422,Each one is dumber than the last.
00:27:53.464,00:28:01.138,"Plus, they all have ADD and although my husband nor I have red hair, they are all creepy ginger kids."
00:28:02.764,00:28:04.808,That's one theory.
00:28:04.850,00:28:09.771,"You gave me too much Pitocin when I was in labor, and it screwed up their DNA."
00:28:09.813,00:28:12.149,That's not a theory.
00:28:12.191,00:28:15.944,"Mrs. Schuester, is your sister on some kind of new psychotropic medication?"
00:28:15.986,00:28:17.112,Not that I know of.
00:28:17.154,00:28:18.989,That's offensive.
00:28:19.031,00:28:20.324,Are you all right?
00:28:20.366,00:28:27.540,"Here's the deal, Wu: my husband does the taxes for some very powerful mid-sized law firms in this town."
00:28:27.581,00:28:30.626,And I'm sure somebody would be more than happy to take on my lawsuit.
00:28:30.668,00:28:31.751,You'll never win.
00:28:31.793,00:28:32.919,I don't have to win.
00:28:32.961,00:28:34.796,There's only two OBs in this town.
00:28:34.838,00:28:43.763,"You get even the slightest stink on you, and you can bet that a bunch of your patients will just close on up their legs and walk on over to Dr. Chin."
00:28:43.805,00:28:46.266,"Okay, this is outrageous."
00:28:47.059,00:28:49.811,What do you want?
00:28:53.982,00:28:56.776,"Listen here, treasure-trail, we're about to have a smackdown."
00:28:56.818,00:28:58.778,I don't want to have a confrontation.
00:28:58.820,00:29:02.157,"Don't play stupid with me, stubbles."
00:29:02.199,00:29:06.453,I'm having Finn's baby and you need to back off.
00:29:06.495,00:29:09.707,I'm asking you as nicely as I possibly can.
00:29:09.748,00:29:12.125,Leave him alone.
00:29:14.044,00:29:15.795,You're right.
00:29:15.837,00:29:19.758,"I've helped you not because it's the right thing to do, but because I had romantic ulterior motives."
00:29:20.842,00:29:24.804,"But just so we're clear, you're the one who's cheating."
00:29:24.846,00:29:26.181,Excuse me?
00:29:26.223,00:29:28.267,I have on good authority that you're Sue Sylvester's mole.
00:29:28.308,00:29:30.810,"And you can deny it all you want, but I know it's true."
00:29:30.852,00:29:32.104,I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:29:32.145,00:29:34.189,"Sue's not on your side, Quinn."
00:29:32.145,00:29:35.482,She's not on anyone's side but her own.
00:29:38.318,00:29:40.862,She'll probably try to rip off your uniform with her bare hands.
00:29:40.904,00:29:45.825,"Every time you whisper in her ear, you empower her to do more damage to the Glee Club."
00:29:45.867,00:29:51.831,"And right now, Glee Club is all you have, and if I were you, I'd recognize who my true friends are."
00:29:51.873,00:29:53.833,"Oh, and I'd practice a little bit more."
00:29:53.875,00:29:57.212,Because you obviously have a lot you need to express.
00:29:57.254,00:30:01.508,"Oh, you have no idea."
00:31:17.959,00:31:20.920,And there ain't nothin' I can do about it.
00:31:52.244,00:31:54.913,"All right, everybody, take five."
00:32:08.218,00:32:14.641,"We would just like to say that although we find ourselves on opposite sides, we hope you enjoy our number and we look forward to seeing yours..."
00:32:14.683,00:32:16.059,SUE: Get on with it!
00:32:16.101,00:32:18.437,Enough with the jibba-jabba!
00:32:18.478,00:32:20.898,"Sue, you can't talk to kids that way."
00:32:29.740,00:32:31.366,"All right, that's it. Come on."
00:32:31.408,00:32:32.992,She had her chance.
00:32:33.034,00:32:33.786,We're leaving.
00:32:33.827,00:32:36.037,I'm sorry.
00:32:36.079,00:32:38.081,"No, and that's the point, there is no fire."
00:32:38.123,00:32:44.170,"You know, it's sad enough that my Sue's Kids are living in squalor and probably on food stamps."
00:32:44.212,00:32:46.590,My dad's a dentist.
00:32:44.212,00:32:48.425,"But for you to drag them in here and bore them to death, I won't stand for it."
00:32:48.467,00:32:49.593,"Come on, kids, out."
00:32:49.635,00:32:51.386,"We're going for conies, my treat."
00:32:51.428,00:32:53.012,"All right, that's it!"
00:32:53.054,00:32:54.013,Really?
00:32:54.055,00:32:55.474,"You know what, Sue?"
00:32:55.515,00:32:59.394,"You've been pretty honest about your feelings for me, so let me return the favor."
00:32:59.436,00:33:00.813,"You're rude, Sue."
00:33:00.854,00:33:03.816,"You have no class, and you are a terrible teacher!"
00:33:03.857,00:33:05.609,I'll have you know I have my PhD.
00:33:05.651,00:33:07.319,"You got it online, Sue!"
00:33:07.360,00:33:09.195,"You are a failed performer, Will!"
00:33:09.237,00:33:11.490,You weren't good enough to make it in the real world.
00:33:11.531,00:33:16.286,You're not even good enough to run this stupid little club that nobody cares about.
00:33:16.328,00:33:18.246,"Time after time, Will, you fail!"
00:33:18.288,00:33:27.756,"You spend every waking moment of your life figuring out ways to terrify children to try to make you feel better about yourself, and the fact that you're probably gonna spend the rest of your life alone!"
00:33:27.798,00:33:29.675,How dare you to talk to me like that!
00:33:29.716,00:33:31.301,Don't you even go...!
00:33:35.931,00:33:37.641,Enough!
00:33:37.683,00:33:45.106,"I'm sorry Mr. Shue, Ms. Sylvester, but if we wanted to hear Mom and Dad fight, those of us who still have two parents would just stay home on payday."
00:33:45.148,00:33:47.776,I agree. Glee Club is supposed to be fun.
00:33:47.818,00:33:50.236,"And furthermore, I don't like this minority business."
00:33:50.278,00:33:55.074,"I may be a strong, proud black woman, but I'm a lot more than that. I'm out."
00:33:55.116,00:33:56.075,"M-me, too."
00:33:56.117,00:34:01.164,"Fellow Glee Clubbers, it would be an honor to show you how a real storm-out is done."
00:34:27.190,00:34:28.107,Is that necessary?
00:34:28.149,00:34:29.693,It's nothing I haven't seen before.
00:34:29.735,00:34:31.820,"I mean, I am the one who knocked her up."
00:34:31.862,00:34:33.488,Just standard operating procedure.
00:34:35.323,00:34:36.533,"You okay, Mr. Schuester?"
00:34:36.575,00:34:38.117,You seem upset.
00:34:38.159,00:34:41.204,"Just, just a little stressed."
00:34:41.246,00:34:43.122,"Will, you're about to see your child for the first time."
00:34:43.164,00:34:45.834,Can you forget about those dancing delinquents for one minute?
00:34:45.876,00:34:49.588,You're right. I'm sorry.
00:34:50.422,00:34:54.217,"Oh, my parents are gonna kill me if I don't come home with the DVD."
00:35:04.352,00:35:05.395,Got it right here.
00:35:05.437,00:35:07.773,All right!
00:35:10.025,00:35:11.150,The gel.
00:35:11.192,00:35:12.151,Oh!
00:35:13.486,00:35:15.154,WILL: You okay?
00:35:15.196,00:35:18.199,"It's really... Yeah, it's a little cold."
00:35:25.206,00:35:26.625,Wow!
00:35:27.584,00:35:29.586,That's him!
00:35:32.422,00:35:34.549,"Oh, hold on a sec."
00:35:34.591,00:35:38.177,What?
00:35:38.219,00:35:40.221,"Well, not exactly."
00:35:40.263,00:35:44.434,"This is really embarrassing, but it appears as if your boy is a girl."
00:35:45.936,00:35:47.353,"Oh, my God!"
00:35:47.395,00:35:49.188,"No, he never had one."
00:35:49.230,00:35:50.607,Must have misread the first sonogram.
00:35:50.649,00:35:51.900,Sorry about that.
00:36:03.620,00:36:08.374,"Honey, I didn't know that having a boy was so important to you."
00:36:08.416,00:36:12.378,It isn't.
00:36:12.420,00:36:16.299,I don't care what she is.
00:36:16.341,00:36:18.844,She's all ours.
00:36:21.346,00:36:24.182,I'm just so... happy.
00:36:26.434,00:36:34.734,"No matter what happens, I want you to remember at this moment, that we love each other, okay?"
00:36:48.289,00:36:49.248,"Hey, Sue."
00:36:49.290,00:36:52.669,"William, close the door."
00:36:55.714,00:36:57.716,"I, uh, wanted to talk to you about the auditorium."
00:36:57.757,00:37:00.677,"Good. I wanted to come to you, too, but I have no idea where your office is."
00:37:00.719,00:37:02.054,Why don't you have a seat.
00:37:02.095,00:37:04.097,Sure.
00:37:05.098,00:37:08.226,"So, I decided to step down as co-head of Glee."
00:37:09.477,00:37:10.687,Really?
00:37:12.313,00:37:16.860,I can't stand the sight of kids getting emotional unless it's from physical exhaustion.
00:37:16.902,00:37:18.277,"Yeah, it did get pretty bad in there."
00:37:18.319,00:37:19.278,"Oh, yeah."
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.697,I'd still like to stay on as consigliere.
00:37:20.739,00:37:26.536,"You know, maybe you could show me your set lists before competitions, just so I feel like I'm contributing."
00:37:26.578,00:37:27.662,Cool.
00:37:27.704,00:37:29.789,"You know, I was a veejay for a couple of years."
00:37:29.831,00:37:33.085,"Not MTV, but still."
00:37:33.919,00:37:37.797,Why do I feel like I'm about to fall through a trapdoor into a pit of fire?
00:37:37.839,00:37:39.382,Because you don't trust me.
00:37:39.424,00:37:40.299,Mm.
00:37:39.424,00:37:41.509,I know my methods are extreme.
00:37:41.551,00:37:50.476,"And I know I'm not like the rest of you hippies, caring about the kids' feelings as if they're real, but I do care about teaching."
00:37:50.518,00:37:53.897,"And when I coach them, and they win..."
00:37:53.939,00:37:55.190,I win.
00:37:56.441,00:37:58.902,And you know how I feel about winning.
00:37:58.944,00:38:00.278,I do.
00:38:01.362,00:38:04.532,"Look, who's to say everything I do is 100% on the ball?"
00:38:04.574,00:38:05.575,No one would say that.
00:38:05.617,00:38:08.327,Probably right.
00:38:08.369,00:38:10.247,"But, um, in hindsight..."
00:38:11.372,00:38:15.168,...you were right to shine the spotlight on the fact that those kids are minorities.
00:38:15.210,00:38:18.255,...because you're all minorities.
00:38:18.296,00:38:19.589,You are in the Glee Club.
00:38:19.631,00:38:24.385,"Now there are only 12 of you, and all you have is each other."
00:38:24.427,00:38:29.348,"So it doesn't matter that Rachel is Jewish, or that Finn is..."
00:38:29.390,00:38:31.350,Unable to tell my rights from my lefts.
00:38:32.393,00:38:35.939,"Sure. Or that Santana is Latina, or that Quinn is..."
00:38:35.981,00:38:37.190,...pregnant.
00:38:39.818,00:38:43.947,"Sorry, Q. It'll be all over the blogosphere by this afternoon."
00:38:43.989,00:38:46.407,Now everybody knows...
00:38:46.449,00:38:49.202,including me.
00:39:04.676,00:39:06.303,How could you do that?
00:39:06.344,00:39:09.388,Do you have any idea how much pain you caused by running that story?
00:39:09.430,00:39:11.183,Sue made me do it.
00:39:11.224,00:39:16.646,This was a particularly interesting find from today's round of locker checks.
00:39:19.482,00:39:21.985,Are you an Eve who was born a Steve?
00:39:22.027,00:39:26.281,"Because if you are, I think there's a special school that would better address your needs."
00:39:26.323,00:39:28.407,And I think that school is in Thailand.
00:39:28.449,00:39:31.328,Rachel gave them to me so I wouldn't run the Quinn story.
00:39:31.369,00:39:31.870,What Quinn story?
00:39:31.911,00:39:35.915,Quinn Fabray's pregnant.
00:39:38.459,00:39:40.586,Not a chance.
00:39:40.628,00:39:49.346,"If my head cheerleader was pregnant, jeopardizing the very future of my Cheerios and thus my teaching tenure, I think she would have come to me."
00:39:52.473,00:39:54.142,I have three sources confirming.
00:39:59.480,00:40:01.316,Please don't expel me.
00:40:01.358,00:40:03.068,I'll kill the story.
00:40:04.069,00:40:07.322,No. Run it.
00:40:07.864,00:40:10.742,"I'm sorry, Rachel."
00:40:13.786,00:40:17.290,FINN: It's okay. It's okay.
00:40:17.332,00:40:21.127,It's okay. It's okay.
00:40:24.797,00:40:27.175,Everything's gonna be okay.
00:00:30.322,00:00:32.992,"What the hell, Karofsky?!"
00:00:33.033,00:00:37.078,"Oh, I've wanted to do that ever since fifth grade when you made fun of me for getting pubes."
00:00:37.120,00:00:45.337,"Now that you've joined Lullaby Lees and insperminated the queen of the Chastity Ball, and dropped below us hockey dudes on the food chain, it's open season."
00:00:45.379,00:00:46.672,"Screw you, Karofsky!"
00:00:46.714,00:00:49.090,You and your Neanderthal Puckheads are nothing!
00:00:49.132,00:00:51.092,"You're gonna pay for this, dude!"
00:00:51.134,00:00:53.679,"No, I'm not. You two don't have the juice anymore."
00:01:07.026,00:01:08.569,Hmm...
00:01:09.611,00:01:10.946,"Hey, guys."
00:01:12.155,00:01:13.323,Okay.
00:01:14.366,00:01:21.040,"As you know, even though she refuses to wear the ring and won't tell anyone including her mother about the engagement, Emma and I are in fact getting married."
00:01:21.081,00:01:25.126,"Yes, and Ken has convinced me that we need to at least be in the same room when the marriage is certified."
00:01:25.168,00:01:27.046,KEN: What can I say?
00:01:27.086,00:01:29.464,We're going to Hawaii and getting married on the beach.
00:01:33.176,00:01:36.805,"No, no, no, no, I picked Hawaii because it's far away from everybody we know."
00:01:36.847,00:01:38.306,Oh.
00:01:38.348,00:01:45.188,"The thing is is that after a very brief private ceremony, Ken has decided he would like to have a first dance."
00:01:45.230,00:01:47.315,"The problem is, we can't decide on a song."
00:01:47.357,00:01:50.069,"Yes, I would like to have I Could Have Danced All Night."
00:01:50.110,00:01:52.153,"Oh, from My Fair Lady."
00:01:52.195,00:01:54.615,Great choice.
00:01:54.656,00:01:56.157,Yes.
00:01:59.661,00:02:01.622,I want The Thong Song.
00:02:03.624,00:02:06.585,I need something I can shake my moneymaker to.
00:02:06.627,00:02:08.420,Um...
00:02:08.462,00:02:09.838,"I was remembering, um..."
00:02:14.217,00:02:19.180,Right? So I thought maybe you could find a way to use both of our songs.
00:02:19.222,00:02:25.062,"Um, and I-- well, we both need/want/need dance lessons."
00:02:25.104,00:02:29.399,"Yeah, I mean, I might need a bit of polishing, but it's the Emster here you really have to work with."
00:02:29.441,00:02:32.069,I had a monster case of athlete's foot a couple years back.
00:02:32.111,00:02:35.530,"Had to get all my toenails removed. So if she steps on my feet during the dance, I might pass out."
00:02:37.699,00:02:40.452,"We would, uh... be very happy to pay you for your time, Will."
00:02:40.494,00:02:44.247,"No, no, I want to give you these lessons as a wedding gift."
00:02:46.249,00:02:48.043,Sound good?
00:02:48.085,00:02:49.670,Great.
00:02:50.712,00:02:52.089,This is a disaster.
00:02:52.131,00:02:59.220,"Our reputation as McKinley High's it couple is in serious jeopardy if we don't find some way to be cool again, Finn."
00:02:59.262,00:03:00.597,The slushy war has commenced.
00:03:00.639,00:03:03.224,"And if Finn and Quinn got nailed, none of us are safe."
00:03:03.266,00:03:11.025,"Okay, guys, we're a little behind for Sectionals, thanks to our Sue Sylvester detour, but you guys seem to really enjoy doing mash-ups, right?"
00:03:11.066,00:03:12.901,And I'm gonna keep you guys fired up.
00:03:12.943,00:03:16.237,"Plus, there's an important lesson to be learned with mash-ups."
00:03:16.279,00:03:18.323,"Sometimes things are so different, they don't feel like they go together."
00:03:18.365,00:03:25.246,"But the big difference between them is what makes them great, like... chocolate and bacon."
00:03:25.288,00:03:27.082,Or Glee Club and football.
00:03:27.124,00:03:30.627,Exactly. But you've proven that it is a great combination.
00:03:30.669,00:03:40.971,"my personal favorite song, and your homework for the week is to find an unexpected mash-up to go with it."
00:03:41.013,00:03:42.681,Bust a Move?
00:03:42.723,00:03:45.266,"MERCEDES: Yeah, this song is old school."
00:03:45.308,00:03:47.186,"All right, um, Artie?"
00:03:47.227,00:03:48.937,Try to follow along on the bass.
00:03:48.979,00:03:50.147,"Finn, take us through it."
00:03:50.189,00:03:52.066,"Uh, I'm sorry, Mr. Schuester."
00:03:52.107,00:03:54.442,I got corn syrup in my eye.
00:03:54.484,00:03:57.278,"Okay, uh, Puck, how about it?"
00:04:00.199,00:04:03.952,I am shocked at the lack of leading-man ambition in this room right now.
00:04:03.994,00:04:06.287,"It's okay, Rachel."
00:04:03.994,00:04:08.874,I guess I'm gonna have to show these guys how it's done.
00:06:19.171,00:06:22.341,"So, how can I, uh, how can I help you kids?"
00:06:22.381,00:06:26.220,"Is it, uh, too many friends on MySpace or...?"
00:06:26.261,00:06:32.351,"I can't believe we're saying this, but we need some advice on how to be cool."
00:06:32.391,00:06:39.941,"Yeah, you must have picked up some ideas about what cool people over the years.g them Not that you were never cool yourself."
00:06:39.983,00:06:46.447,"Yeah, well, um, but, um, you're two of the most popular kids in school."
00:06:46.489,00:06:48.867,"We were, until we joined Glee Club."
00:06:48.909,00:06:51.452,"That's why he got a slushy facial, I'm sure of it."
00:06:51.494,00:06:54.248,"Okay, I see."
00:06:54.289,00:06:57.458,"Um, don't really have any pamphlets on how to be popular."
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.460,"Uh, okay, right, well, let's..."
00:06:59.502,00:07:02.130,"Why, why is it so important for you to be cool, huh?"
00:07:02.172,00:07:05.633,Don't you like being in Glee?
00:07:05.675,00:07:11.472,"When your bank account is full, you can get away with doing just about anything."
00:07:11.514,00:07:15.185,But right now we're like toxic assets.
00:07:21.691,00:07:24.694,And she got into Arizona State.
00:07:24.736,00:07:26.738,Sunglasses are so sexy.
00:07:28.323,00:07:30.242,Sunglasses.
00:07:31.534,00:07:34.329,"Yeah, sunglasses are, um, really, really cool."
00:07:34.371,00:07:39.084,"I'm always seeing, you know, celebrities wear them in um, magazines, even at night."
00:07:39.126,00:07:43.004,"Very popular. Gives you a sense of mystery, you know. Rappers."
00:07:43.046,00:07:46.341,"Totally. It's like you can't see their eyes, so they have all the power."
00:07:46.383,00:07:49.136,"I could be looking at your boobs, and you'd have no idea."
00:07:50.929,00:07:53.181,"Um, no, um, no."
00:07:53.223,00:07:58.145,"Kids, look, the most important thing is that you be yourselves, okay?"
00:07:58.186,00:08:00.563,"And if people don't like you for that, then I'm sorry."
00:08:00.605,00:08:01.982,But who needs 'em?
00:08:22.252,00:08:23.211,Hi.
00:08:25.422,00:08:27.382,Hi.
00:08:35.765,00:08:38.643,It was my cousin Betty's.
00:08:38.685,00:08:46.985,"We were obsessed with Princess Di's dress when we were little girls, so, um, when she got married, she insisted on having this, uh, this long train."
00:08:47.027,00:08:49.570,Is there a reason you have it on now?
00:08:49.612,00:08:51.531,"Yes, yes, yeah."
00:08:52.824,00:08:57.620,"Um, she didn't wear it to her dance rehearsals, and the night of the wedding, her husband kept stepping on the train."
00:09:00.290,00:09:01.582,The priest cried.
00:09:01.624,00:09:03.502,They were divorced three months later.
00:09:05.003,00:09:07.088,"Actually, maybe I shouldn't wear it."
00:09:07.130,00:09:09.257,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's all good, it's all good."
00:09:09.299,00:09:11.592,"We'll, uh, we'll see how you move in it, all right?"
00:09:11.634,00:09:13.011,Okay.
00:09:13.053,00:09:19.600,"Um, so first, um, let's do Ken's selection, and then, uh, we'll work in your song for the big finish."
00:09:21.102,00:09:23.813,"Hey, Emma, I'm really excited about this."
00:09:23.855,00:09:26.525,Fantastic.
00:09:28.735,00:09:31.821,This thing right here...
00:09:31.863,00:09:34.866,is letting all the ladies know...
00:09:34.908,00:09:36.451,what guys talk about.
00:09:36.493,00:09:40.830,"You know, the finer things in life."
00:09:40.872,00:09:42.874,Check it out.
00:10:31.172,00:10:32.757,"Oh, God, are you okay?"
00:10:32.799,00:10:34.175,I'm okay. Are you okay?
00:10:34.217,00:10:35.676,Yeah.
00:10:35.718,00:10:37.262,Oh...
00:10:37.304,00:10:38.805,Ah.
00:10:40.223,00:10:42.183,It's the darned Thong Song.
00:10:42.225,00:10:44.102,I don't think it's the song.
00:10:45.937,00:10:48.064,I think you need a new dress.
00:10:48.106,00:10:50.691,Come on.
00:10:50.733,00:10:52.569,All right.
00:10:52.611,00:10:54.695,Upsy-daisy.
00:10:54.737,00:10:57.907,"All right, let's try, uh, reverse tear on two."
00:10:57.949,00:10:59.618,Let's not.
00:10:59.659,00:11:02.954,"Hey, Azimio, I'm the quarterback-- I call the plays."
00:11:02.996,00:11:06.707,"Yeah, well, some of the guys was talking, and we're starting to question your leadership ability."
00:11:06.749,00:11:12.339,"Yeah, like maybe you're having trouble making good choices, as in, for instance, choosing to join Homo Explosion."
00:11:12.380,00:11:15.425,Do I need to remind you that Glee Club helped us win our first game of the season?
00:11:15.467,00:11:17.010,What have you done for me lately?
00:11:17.051,00:11:21.306,"Yeah, we're taking a bunch of heat, because you like kissing dudes all of a sudden."
00:11:21.348,00:11:22.723,"You're not being a team player, man."
00:11:22.765,00:11:25.310,Couldn't believe you was man enough to knock up Quinn Fabray.
00:11:25.352,00:11:28.188,You sure a real man didn't sneak in there and do it for you?
00:11:28.229,00:11:29.730,That's it!
00:11:30.773,00:11:31.732,TEAM: Fight! Fight! Fight!
00:11:31.774,00:11:33.734,Fight! Fight! Fight!
00:11:34.777,00:11:36.321,Fight! Fight!
00:11:36.363,00:11:38.448,Fight! Fight! Fight!
00:11:38.490,00:11:41.451,"Get back, get off!"
00:11:41.493,00:11:43.744,"On the sidelines, take a knee."
00:11:43.786,00:11:45.372,Now!
00:11:46.789,00:11:49.250,"What if you had broken Finn's arm, huh?"
00:11:49.292,00:11:53.046,We'd be worse off and more pathetic than we already are!
00:11:54.047,00:11:55.215,Where's Puckerman?
00:11:55.256,00:11:57.133,"Uh, he said he had to miss practice today."
00:11:57.175,00:11:58.426,He's working on something for Glee Club.
00:12:02.263,00:12:04.765,"Hey, man, don't push me, man!"
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.267,Football...
00:12:06.309,00:12:11.981,"is war, and no one single man can win that war, not even if they strap nukes on him."
00:12:12.023,00:12:15.068,I want you to start acting like a team again!
00:12:15.109,00:12:19.030,"When we won that one game, it wasn't because we were dancing!"
00:12:19.072,00:12:21.074,It was because we were of singular purpose!
00:12:21.115,00:12:30.041,"I want you to start hanging more, spend more time together, which is why, starting next week I am adding extra practice on Thursdays at 3:30."
00:12:30.083,00:12:31.668,"But, Coach, that's when Glee rehearses."
00:12:31.710,00:12:34.713,"You know what, I have had it up to here with Schuester and Glee."
00:12:34.753,00:12:39.426,"Here's the story, quarterback, and you tell Puckerman this when you see him."
00:12:39.467,00:12:42.262,"That practice is mandatory, no exceptions."
00:12:42.303,00:12:46.725,"So you're gonna have to choose what's more important to you, football or Glee Club."
00:13:10.749,00:13:15.420,"PUCK: I know this looks weird, but wait until you see what happens next."
00:13:15.462,00:13:16.879,My ears are starting to hurt.
00:13:16.921,00:13:18.715,Could we take a break?
00:13:18.757,00:13:20.467,Okay.
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.886,Sure.
00:13:23.928,00:13:25.472,"I know, it's whack."
00:13:25.513,00:13:30.851,But I also remember what my history teacher told us last semester: Only Nixon can go to China.
00:13:30.893,00:13:39.277,"I have no idea what she meant, but it reminded me of when my family ordered Chinese food and sat down together for our traditional Simchas Torah screening of Schindler's List."
00:13:39.319,00:13:41.862,That's really when all of this started.
00:13:41.904,00:13:45.659,"It wasn't the most normal tradition, but we did it for my mom."
00:13:45.700,00:13:49.036,She said it made her feel connected to her Jewish roots.
00:13:51.164,00:13:55.168,"As she was giving me my sweet-and-sour pork, she said something that really hit home."
00:13:55.209,00:13:57.754,"You're no better than them, Noah."
00:13:59.005,00:14:02.091,Why can't you date a Jewish girl?
00:14:02.133,00:14:04.885,That night I had the strangest dream.
00:14:04.927,00:14:10.141,"I knew it was a dream, because there's no way Rachel could have climbed up the wall outside my window with no shoes on."
00:14:17.106,00:14:21.194,"When I woke up, I knew it was more than a dream-- it was a message from God."
00:14:21.235,00:14:26.741,"Rachel was a hot Jew, and the Good Lord wanted me to get into her pants."
00:14:42.006,00:14:45.092,I picked it up for you when I was buying dip.
00:14:45.134,00:14:52.183,"It's grape-- I know that's your favorite, because the last time I tossed a grape one in your face, you licked your lips before you cleaned yourself off."
00:14:52.225,00:14:55.186,"Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to work together on some mash-up ideas."
00:14:55.228,00:14:56.937,Things happened pretty fast from that point.
00:14:56.979,00:15:00.107,Getting her to make out with me was easier than I thought.
00:15:00.149,00:15:04.571,Guess she's kinda desperate.
00:15:04.612,00:15:06.239,"You okay, baby?"
00:15:06.280,00:15:08.783,I can't do this.
00:15:08.825,00:15:09.950,Why?
00:15:09.992,00:15:12.036,We're a couple of good-looking Jews.
00:15:12.078,00:15:13.872,It's natural.
00:15:13.913,00:15:16.040,I-I can't give myself to someone who isn't...
00:15:16.082,00:15:18.292,brave enough to sing a solo.
00:15:19.460,00:15:27.051,"If you don't have the guts to do that, then-then how are you gonna be bold enough to deal with the ups and downs of loving an admittedly high-maintenance girl like me?"
00:15:27.093,00:15:29.136,Are you questioning my badass-ness?
00:15:29.178,00:15:31.013,Have you seen my guns?
00:15:31.055,00:15:34.684,"No, I..."
00:15:34.726,00:15:37.395,"your arms are lovely, but..."
00:15:37.437,00:15:40.314,I just don't see us working out.
00:15:43.276,00:15:47.947,"WILL: So, any ideas for the mash-up?"
00:15:49.031,00:15:50.575,WILL: Anybody?
00:15:50.617,00:15:53.160,"Oh, come on, guys."
00:15:53.202,00:15:55.079,It's like you're daring me to start dancing.
00:15:55.121,00:15:56.038,I will.
00:15:56.080,00:15:57.998,I've been working on something.
00:15:58.040,00:15:59.417,"WILL: Oh, yeah?"
00:15:59.459,00:16:03.003,It's my personal tribute to a musical Jewish icon.
00:16:03.045,00:16:06.006,"WILL: Uh, fantastic."
00:16:06.048,00:16:07.634,Let's hear it.
00:18:02.749,00:18:04.042,Yeah!
00:18:11.173,00:18:13.217,"You know, I really think this is working."
00:18:13.259,00:18:14.928,I think we look super cool.
00:18:14.969,00:18:16.136,"I'm proud of you, Finn."
00:18:16.178,00:18:17.513,I'm proud of us.
00:18:19.891,00:18:22.142,It just means you want people to like you.
00:18:22.184,00:18:24.228,I think that's healthy.
00:18:24.270,00:18:28.148,Being popular just means you can have it all.
00:18:28.190,00:18:29.149,"Oh. Hey, guys."
00:18:29.191,00:18:31.151,You thirsty?
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.570,Sure. Thanks.
00:18:39.201,00:18:41.161,You can't do this!
00:18:41.203,00:18:47.167,Just imagine what's gonna happen if you don't show up to practice on Thursday and quit that little Glee Club for good.
00:18:47.209,00:18:49.169,"Bros before hi-ho's, dude."
00:18:49.211,00:18:51.005,Don't forget that.
00:18:58.679,00:19:02.349,"I hear people say, That's not how I define marriage."
00:19:02.391,00:19:05.185,"Well, to them I say, Love knows no bounds."
00:19:07.229,00:19:09.440,I'm certainly not advocating intimacy with your pets.
00:19:09.482,00:19:12.819,"I, for one, think intimacy has no place in a marriage."
00:19:17.239,00:19:19.659,"So woof on Prop 15, Ohio."
00:19:19.700,00:19:22.286,And that's how Sue... C's it.
00:19:22.328,00:19:23.663,Rod.
00:19:25.873,00:19:29.127,And we'll be right back after this.
00:19:34.256,00:19:35.466,"You still smell like scotch, Rod."
00:19:37.343,00:19:41.263,"You know, Sue, there's a lot of pressure being a local celebrity."
00:19:41.305,00:19:45.267,"Most women find me intimidating-- the teeth, the hair..."
00:19:45.309,00:19:47.603,It's a lot to take in and I know it.
00:19:51.273,00:19:54.234,And I think you just might be that gal.
00:19:54.276,00:19:56.445,"Don't you have a wife, Rod?"
00:19:56.487,00:19:58.948,She drowned.
00:20:00.116,00:20:02.660,"So now, I've got the condo all to myself."
00:20:02.702,00:20:05.496,Maybe we could go out sometime.
00:20:05.538,00:20:07.247,Have a little fondue.
00:20:07.289,00:20:09.458,Sure.
00:20:09.500,00:20:11.169,Okay.
00:20:11.210,00:20:13.838,"Bread, cheese-- fantastic."
00:20:13.880,00:20:15.965,I'll call you.
00:21:17.985,00:21:21.781,"Sue, whoo, that was amazing."
00:21:21.822,00:21:35.253,"Oh! You know, I have to admit at first when you suggested that I teach you a few steps, I was hesitant, you know, because how horrible you were to me and the Glee kids when Figgins made you co-director."
00:21:35.294,00:21:37.713,"Well, live and let learn, my friend."
00:21:37.755,00:21:39.799,That is ultimately what I got to.
00:21:41.092,00:21:43.343,It's nice not being at each other's throats.
00:21:50.392,00:21:53.187,Sue Sylvester is in love.
00:21:53.229,00:21:55.481,E-9.
00:21:58.025,00:22:02.196,"You sunk my battleship, Rod, and you sunk it hard."
00:22:03.572,00:22:07.952,"You know, Sue, I like to swing."
00:22:07.994,00:22:11.205,I could be good with that.
00:22:11.247,00:22:16.376,Rod has invited me to the Second Annual Allen County Sickle Cell Anemia Dance-A-Thon.
00:22:16.418,00:22:17.419,Ooh.
00:22:26.344,00:22:27.888,"Oh, well, Erma just raved about you."
00:22:27.930,00:22:30.390,So I'm actually touched.
00:22:37.481,00:22:42.278,"Yeah, well, she's just a confused kid, and the least I can offer her is my compassion."
00:22:42.320,00:22:45.405,"But you, mister..."
00:22:45.447,00:22:51.662,The Sue Sylvester who has been obsessed with sabotaging your every move is now just a distant memory.
00:22:51.704,00:22:53.580,"That's great, Sue."
00:22:53.622,00:23:01.839,"Now all I feel for you is sympathy, whether it be for your sham of a marriage or the fact that Coach Tanaka's finally laying down the law with regard to Glee Club."
00:23:01.881,00:23:04.133,Wait. What?
00:23:04.175,00:23:06.844,"Yeah, Tanaka-san's making the kids choose."
00:23:06.886,00:23:08.846,"I mean, come on."
00:23:08.888,00:23:11.307,What kid's gonna choose Glee Club over football?
00:23:11.349,00:23:12.390,It'd be ridiculous.
00:23:17.938,00:23:19.815,You knew I had a standing Glee rehearsal on Thursday.
00:23:19.857,00:23:23.027,We sat down and worked out a schedule when some of your guys joined the club.
00:23:23.069,00:23:25.321,Circumstances have changed.
00:23:27.365,00:23:28.657,It's my responsibility to fix it.
00:23:28.699,00:23:31.702,Sorry if me doing my job interferes with your club.
00:23:31.744,00:23:33.871,"Ken, we've known each other for years."
00:23:36.999,00:23:39.417,"You know, let's get into what this is really about."
00:23:41.337,00:23:44.548,You're upset that I don't like your song for your wedding mash-up.
00:23:44.590,00:23:46.633,And you're right; it's not my place to have an opinion.
00:23:46.675,00:23:48.386,"Why don't you just cut the crap, Will?"
00:23:48.426,00:23:50.054,You're not that naive.
00:23:50.096,00:23:51.972,This is not about a song.
00:23:52.014,00:23:53.974,It's about my fiancÃ©e.
00:23:54.016,00:23:57.311,"You and I, the whole world knows that I'm just a consolation prize to you."
00:23:57.353,00:23:58.979,How do you think that makes me feel?
00:23:59.021,00:24:00.522,Emma's totally into you.
00:24:00.564,00:24:02.900,Emma is settling for me.
00:24:02.942,00:24:05.194,And I love her so much I don't care.
00:24:05.236,00:24:10.448,But it doesn't mean I appreciate you coming in with your Gene Kelly charm and getting high off of her fawning over you.
00:24:12.159,00:24:15.413,I-I have never intentionally encouraged Emma.
00:24:23.461,00:24:25.381,"You don't have to worry about it anymore, though."
00:24:26.632,00:24:28.634,So are we cool?
00:24:30.552,00:24:32.972,Can I have my guys on Thursday again?
00:24:33.013,00:24:34.514,3:30?
00:24:34.556,00:24:36.225,You keep your rehearsal.
00:24:36.267,00:24:37.601,I'll keep my practice.
00:24:37.643,00:24:40.313,We'll let the kids decide who's first choice...
00:24:54.952,00:24:59.706,...making Tommy Tune the first to win Tony gold in four categories.
00:24:59.748,00:25:01.792,Totally interesting.
00:25:01.834,00:25:05.212,"You know, you never told me what you thought of my mash-up solo."
00:25:05.254,00:25:09.216,You're still missing the elusive high B that's a brass ring for a bari-tenor.
00:25:28.610,00:25:30.612,You're pretty good at this.
00:25:30.654,00:25:33.782,I've had a lot of practice.
00:25:33.824,00:25:36.243,You're actually a lot luckier than me and Quinn.
00:25:36.285,00:25:37.535,Your head is shaved.
00:25:39.246,00:25:41.623,I'm really sorry I ever did this to you.
00:25:41.665,00:25:44.168,It's okay.
00:25:44.210,00:25:45.585,"No, it isn't."
00:25:45.627,00:25:47.380,No one deserves this feeling.
00:25:49.631,00:25:54.428,It's not the burning in your eyes or the way the slushie drips all the way into your underpants.
00:25:54.470,00:25:55.553,It's the humiliation.
00:25:57.056,00:25:59.517,I feel like I could burst into tears at any moment.
00:26:01.935,00:26:03.521,"I'm sorry, but..."
00:26:06.857,00:26:11.445,"You're choosing football over Glee, which means we probably can't be together anymore."
00:26:11.487,00:26:13.280,Yes.
00:26:13.322,00:26:15.032,"Damn, I feel like such a bad Jew."
00:26:26.668,00:26:28.212,"Are you ready, yet?"
00:26:28.254,00:26:29.838,"We've only got an hour for lunch, Emma."
00:26:29.880,00:26:32.550,"EMMA: It's not like trying on a pair of jeans, Will."
00:26:46.897,00:26:49.066,It fits okay?
00:26:51.527,00:26:53.529,Yeah. Fits great.
00:26:53.571,00:26:55.613,Terrific.
00:27:05.541,00:27:08.586,Yeah. Terrific.
00:27:10.588,00:27:13.340,"Uh, so, should we see if you can dance in it?"
00:27:14.800,00:27:20.306,Okay. This is the instrumental version of your wedding song.
00:28:43.389,00:28:46.725,Yeah... you can dance in it.
00:28:49.311,00:28:52.147,"So I've got to go and, um..."
00:28:52.189,00:28:53.982,Got the big showdown today at 3:30.
00:28:58.445,00:29:00.072,"Wait, what showdown?"
00:29:00.113,00:29:03.450,I thought... I thought you and Sue had that last week.
00:29:03.492,00:29:06.662,Between me and your fiancÃ©.
00:29:08.414,00:29:12.209,Ken's told all the football players in Glee that they have to choose between the club and the team.
00:29:12.251,00:29:17.715,"And unless all the guys choose Glee, it looks like we won't have enough members for Sectionals."
00:29:17.756,00:29:19.007,Then Glee is over.
00:29:19.049,00:29:21.051,I know.
00:29:22.844,00:29:24.471,"Well, wish me luck."
00:29:32.521,00:29:34.106,"Hey, guys."
00:29:46.868,00:29:49.538,I guess they're not coming.
00:29:49.580,00:29:51.206,"I'm really sorry, guys."
00:29:51.248,00:29:52.291,I can't believe this.
00:29:53.875,00:29:55.377,How can they just abandon us?
00:30:06.263,00:30:07.847,Hi.
00:30:10.267,00:30:11.477,You scared me.
00:30:12.978,00:30:14.229,WILL: Good seeing you.
00:30:25.407,00:30:27.660,"Are you sure about this, Noah?"
00:30:27.701,00:30:31.830,"I mean, choosing us over the team means you might get a slushie in your face every day."
00:30:35.000,00:30:36.418,Bring it.
00:30:40.213,00:30:42.132,Where's Finn?
00:30:47.137,00:30:48.472,Hey!
00:30:48.514,00:30:49.306,"Hey, man."
00:30:49.348,00:30:50.766,You made the right decision.
00:30:50.808,00:30:52.142,"What's up, dude?"
00:30:58.982,00:31:00.400,"Okay, let's huddle up."
00:31:21.963,00:31:24.591,I really don't want to.
00:31:24.633,00:31:27.927,"Honestly, I know how picky you are about what products you use on your face."
00:31:30.389,00:31:33.933,I guess they didn't appreciate me resigning from the team and choosing Glee.
00:31:33.975,00:31:37.145,Probably would've went over better if you didn't announce it in the showers.
00:31:37.187,00:31:39.231,"You are not going to slushie on my man, Kurt."
00:31:39.272,00:31:41.400,Why wouldn't he?
00:31:41.441,00:31:43.943,He doesn't care about us losers anymore.
00:31:43.985,00:31:47.947,"No, that's not true, it's just if I don't do it, the guys on the team are going to kick the crap out of me."
00:31:47.989,00:31:49.491,"Well, we can't have that, can we?"
00:31:50.576,00:31:51.744,What are you doing?
00:31:51.785,00:31:54.246,It's called taking one for the team.
00:32:05.090,00:32:06.550,"Now, get out of here."
00:32:06.592,00:32:11.513,And take some time to think whether or not any of your friends on the football team would've done that for you.
00:32:17.853,00:32:20.063,"Someone get me to a day spa, stat!"
00:32:37.038,00:32:38.582,"Oh, Sue."
00:32:38.624,00:32:41.167,Rod.
00:32:41.209,00:32:42.377,Andrea.
00:32:42.419,00:32:47.591,"Uh, you aren't scheduled to tape another Sue's Corner until tomorrow night."
00:32:47.633,00:32:51.470,I came by special to show you my zoot suit.
00:32:54.055,00:32:57.851,"But, uh, only the men wear those."
00:32:57.893,00:32:59.853,Further embarrassed.
00:33:02.773,00:33:05.567,He took me last year.
00:33:07.068,00:33:11.949,"You didn't think that we were... exclusive, did you?"
00:33:11.990,00:33:14.451,"That's the only way I do it, Rod."
00:33:14.493,00:33:17.120,"I can't be caged in, Sue."
00:33:17.162,00:33:19.873,That's why I got my tiger tattoo.
00:33:19.915,00:33:24.670,"Heck, even my wife understood that."
00:33:27.798,00:33:29.800,No.
00:33:50.779,00:33:52.071,Do you miss it?
00:33:52.113,00:33:54.574,"Hell, no."
00:33:59.371,00:34:02.081,I hope you didn't choose Glee over football because of me.
00:34:02.123,00:34:03.959,Why?
00:34:06.378,00:34:10.549,That's cool. I was going to break up with you anyway.
00:34:13.134,00:34:14.469,"Yes, I was."
00:34:14.511,00:34:17.389,You won't even let me touch your boobs.
00:34:17.430,00:34:19.516,"It's Finn, right?"
00:34:24.145,00:34:25.689,Not with that baby in her belly.
00:34:25.731,00:34:27.148,"You like her, don't you?"
00:34:27.190,00:34:30.193,I can see you staring at her when I'm staring at Finn.
00:34:30.235,00:34:32.696,Is that why you joined Glee?
00:34:32.738,00:34:36.115,To be closer to her?
00:34:36.157,00:34:39.953,"Like I said, they're never breaking up."
00:34:39.995,00:34:42.121,"God, what's the matter with me?"
00:34:42.163,00:34:44.290,I'm a stud and I can't even hold onto a chick like you.
00:34:44.332,00:34:46.376,No offense.
00:34:46.418,00:34:48.294,Why don't girls like me?
00:34:48.336,00:34:51.089,'Cause you're kind of a jerk. No offense.
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.760,I just think you want it too much.
00:34:54.801,00:34:57.804,Which is something I can relate to.
00:34:57.846,00:34:59.556,I want everything too much.
00:35:02.183,00:35:05.520,Our relationship was built on a fantasy.
00:35:05.562,00:35:07.146,Like every other one in my life.
00:35:08.857,00:35:13.987,I think I just agreed to us being together because I thought it would make Finn jealous.
00:35:15.906,00:35:19.367,I just hope we can still be friends.
00:35:19.409,00:35:21.453,We weren't friends before.
00:35:26.207,00:35:27.667,"Hey, Finn."
00:35:27.709,00:35:29.168,Want to have a catch?
00:35:29.210,00:35:31.088,Sure.
00:35:31.129,00:35:33.131,Go long.
00:35:37.677,00:35:39.805,I'm not coming back.
00:35:41.222,00:35:45.852,"These are the moments, Finn."
00:35:45.894,00:35:48.688,"The ones you look back on when you get old and think, what if...?"
00:35:48.730,00:35:51.650,I don't buy that.
00:35:51.691,00:35:58.490,I don't think any one decision makes your life unless you accidentally invent some kind of zombie virus or something.
00:35:58.531,00:36:02.035,No? You're right.
00:36:02.077,00:36:07.666,"Life's a series of choices, a big combination of moments."
00:36:07.707,00:36:12.754,Little ones that add up to big ones that create who you are.
00:36:15.090,00:36:17.216,"You're letting other people make those choices for you, Finn."
00:36:17.258,00:36:26.434,"You're letting them decide who you're going to be, people you're not even going to know in three years, people whose names you're going to forget when you run into them in the hardware store."
00:36:29.270,00:36:35.276,"Yes, I do. Because of all the students I've ever had, you remind me the most of me."
00:36:38.279,00:36:39.698,"Come back to Glee, Finn."
00:36:39.739,00:36:42.993,It's where you belong.
00:36:57.716,00:37:00.552,"Hey, Coach, can I talk to you about something?"
00:37:02.303,00:37:04.556,What? No.
00:37:04.597,00:37:06.599,Uh...
00:37:08.351,00:37:11.437,"I'm the quarterback, right?"
00:37:11.479,00:37:12.731,Sure.
00:37:12.772,00:37:17.777,"Well, all this stuff about having to choose between Glee and football is making it hard for me to lead."
00:37:23.700,00:37:27.370,"Right? Like, they can imagine a future where things are better."
00:37:27.412,00:37:29.956,"Like, Thomas Jefferson, or that kid from the Terminator movies."
00:37:34.544,00:37:38.757,I see a future where...
00:37:38.798,00:37:44.763,Where you can play football and sing and dance and no one gets down on you for it.
00:37:46.264,00:37:48.058,"Where the more different you are, the better."
00:37:52.562,00:38:00.237,"I guess what I'm trying to say is, I don't want to have to choose between them anymore."
00:38:00.278,00:38:03.281,It's not cool.
00:38:15.418,00:38:18.964,"You know, about that Thursday practice, it's, uh..."
00:38:19.005,00:38:21.382,canceled indefinitely.
00:38:19.005,00:38:24.677,"I've got some stuff I got to do that time-- laundry, things like that."
00:38:26.429,00:38:28.598,Oh. Sweet.
00:38:30.308,00:38:31.768,Finn.
00:38:33.394,00:38:36.189,"Tell Puckerman and the other guys, too, will you?"
00:38:38.316,00:38:41.360,"Thanks, Coach."
00:38:43.404,00:38:44.656,Schuester!
00:38:44.697,00:38:46.241,Yeah?
00:38:46.283,00:38:51.370,"I'll need to see that set list for Sectionals after all, and I want it on my desk, warm from the laminator at 5:00 p.m."
00:38:55.500,00:39:04.301,"I will let you fall in love with that kitty cat, and then, on some dark, cold night, I will steal away into your home and punch you in the face."
00:39:06.469,00:39:07.804,"Hey, Sue?"
00:39:07.846,00:39:09.806,What?
00:39:09.848,00:39:11.308,"No, it did not."
00:39:12.892,00:39:15.228,"Q, take off those sunglasses."
00:39:12.892,00:39:17.981,I want to look in your eyes when I give you this piece of business.
00:39:18.023,00:39:19.607,You're off the Cheerios.
00:39:21.442,00:39:23.528,You're a disgrace.
00:39:38.459,00:39:39.669,Hey.
00:39:41.754,00:39:47.302,I wanted to talk to you about your wedding mash-up.
00:39:48.761,00:39:50.889,I've been working really hard on it and...
00:39:53.474,00:39:56.061,...I just can't get those two songs to go together.
00:39:56.102,00:39:58.396,"Yeah, that's because they don't."
00:40:00.523,00:40:02.359,We both know that.
00:40:05.486,00:40:08.323,"They're both good songs, though."
00:40:08.365,00:40:11.450,Great ones.
00:40:17.123,00:40:18.333,"Will, um..."
00:40:18.375,00:40:22.128,"I just wanted to say, uh..."
00:40:22.170,00:40:24.463,thank you.
00:40:24.505,00:40:26.591,For the dance lessons.
00:40:40.980,00:40:44.776,"So, what do you think about my welcome back gift to the club, huh, guys?"
00:40:48.529,00:40:49.906,KURT: And loaded with empty calories.
00:40:49.948,00:40:51.490,"You know why they call them slushies, don't you?"
00:40:51.532,00:40:53.492,Because your butt looks like one if you have too many of them.
00:40:53.534,00:40:56.495,I'd like to propose a toast to Mr. Shue.
00:40:56.537,00:40:59.498,You were right about Glee Club and football being a killer combination.
00:40:59.540,00:41:02.710,Yeah!
00:41:04.545,00:41:10.509,"Mr. Shue, I am sorry to report that we've all been remiss about completing our assignment this week."
00:41:10.551,00:41:13.512,"Yeah, none of us could find a good groove for Bust a Move."
00:41:13.554,00:41:15.890,And I personally feel like a failure.
00:41:15.932,00:41:21.354,"Well, that's okay, guys, because I feel like the lesson landed and that's what's important."
00:41:27.568,00:41:29.446,Do I look okay?
00:41:30.488,00:41:31.530,I'm devastated.
00:41:31.572,00:41:35.534,"Now that I'm off the Cheerios, I'll start every day with a slushie facial."
00:41:35.576,00:41:37.370,"That's okay if that happens, Quinn."
00:41:37.412,00:41:41.791,Because there are 11 of your friends right here who are going to be more than happy to help clean you off.
00:41:41.833,00:41:42.959,Yeah.
00:41:43.001,00:41:44.543,"That's right, girl."
00:41:44.585,00:41:45.962,You know it.
00:41:46.004,00:41:50.549,Oh. Mmm. Brain freeze.
00:41:50.591,00:41:53.803,I can't imagine getting hit in the kisser with one of these.
00:41:55.596,00:41:58.266,"You've never been hit by a slushie before, Mr. Shue?"
00:41:58.308,00:41:59.600,Um...
00:42:02.061,00:42:04.063,"All right, guys."
00:42:05.315,00:42:06.607,We're a team.
00:42:08.443,00:42:10.195,Bring it on.
00:42:10.236,00:42:12.989,"RACHEL: One, two, three."
00:42:17.618,00:42:19.204,Oh...
00:42:20.497,00:42:22.499,All right.
00:00:02.085,00:00:03.629,So here's what you missed last week: Quinn's pregnant...
00:00:03.671,00:00:05.046,You're off the Cheerios.
00:00:03.671,00:00:11.052,"...and everyone thinks that Finn's the father, though really it's Puck, but Quinn thinks he's a Lima loser and doesn't want anything to do with him."
00:00:11.094,00:00:15.474,"Also, Kurt told everybody he's gay, including his dad, who actually kind of cool about it."
00:00:15.516,00:00:17.392,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:47.130,00:00:49.132,You shouldn't do this to yourself.
00:00:49.174,00:00:51.301,Do what?
00:00:52.636,00:00:55.180,I know how much it hurts to be off the team.
00:00:55.222,00:00:57.558,You're just torturing yourself watching them.
00:00:57.599,00:01:00.101,I needed a good distraction.
00:01:00.143,00:01:02.437,From what?
00:01:14.157,00:01:17.118,That's how much a sonogram costs.
00:01:17.160,00:01:19.120,This is just the beginning.
00:01:19.162,00:01:24.418,"There's going to be more doctor's visits, vitamins, new clothes for when I explode."
00:01:24.459,00:01:26.837,What are we going to do?
00:01:26.879,00:01:28.505,What are you going to do?
00:01:28.547,00:01:30.131,I'm looking for a job.
00:01:30.173,00:01:31.592,"I mean, no one's hiring."
00:01:31.633,00:01:35.763,"I almost got in at Olive Garden, but they said I was too tall to be a busboy."
00:01:46.481,00:01:47.733,I will.
00:01:47.775,00:01:50.527,I-I'll find a job.
00:01:50.569,00:01:52.529,"You can count on me, I swear."
00:01:52.571,00:01:53.614,Where you going?
00:01:53.655,00:01:56.075,You were right.
00:01:56.116,00:01:58.786,This does hurt too much.
00:02:08.462,00:02:10.380,"No, the Cheerios are stronger than ever."
00:02:10.422,00:02:13.842,We're gonna take Nationals with this routine.
00:02:20.223,00:02:22.142,Hit the showers.
00:02:33.612,00:02:37.198,"And in order to win, my Cheerios need to appeal to that panel of judges."
00:02:37.240,00:02:47.709,"So if I have a pregnant girl doing a handspring into a double layout, the judges aren't going to be admiring her impeccable form, they're going to be wondering if the centrifugal force is going to make the baby's head start crowning."
00:02:50.253,00:02:52.881,Probably should have told you that earlier.
00:02:52.923,00:02:54.215,This isn't fair.
00:02:54.257,00:02:58.386,Is it fair that I had to stop providing the baseball team with protective cups?
00:03:03.266,00:03:04.267,Is used to overcoming challenges.
00:03:04.309,00:03:07.270,He'll just have to find his own ride to Sectionals.
00:03:07.312,00:03:11.399,That handi-capable bus costs $600 a week to rent.
00:03:11.441,00:03:12.734,We can't afford it.
00:03:16.864,00:03:20.951,Sue Sylvester has boosters that write fat checks.
00:03:20.993,00:03:23.954,None of her travel expenses come out of the school budget.
00:03:23.996,00:03:29.877,"Look, when I was in the glee club, the best part of the competitions was the bus ride to the event."
00:03:29.918,00:03:32.420,It was about camaraderie and supporting each other.
00:03:32.462,00:03:34.255,You think I feel good about this?
00:03:34.297,00:03:37.300,"Well, my students won't stand for it."
00:03:37.342,00:03:40.637,"That's very moving, but my hands are tied, Shue."
00:03:40.679,00:03:45.017,"If you want that bus, you're going to have to find a way to pay for it yourself."
00:03:57.112,00:03:58.279,What about Target?
00:03:58.321,00:03:59.573,Tried.
00:03:59.614,00:04:02.868,"Another doctor bill came to my parents' house last night, Finn."
00:04:02.910,00:04:06.205,We're lucky that I'm clever and intercepted it.
00:04:06.246,00:04:13.378,But we have to start paying these doctor's bills or they're going to go to a collection agency and then my parents are going to find out that I'm with child.
00:04:13.420,00:04:14.588,Your child.
00:04:16.548,00:04:18.133,We're doing a new number for Sectionals.
00:04:18.175,00:04:26.600,"I know that pop songs have sort of been our signature pieces, but I did a little research on past winners, and it turns out that the judges like songs that are more accessible."
00:04:26.641,00:04:28.227,Stuff they know.
00:04:28.268,00:04:30.311,"Uh, standards, Broadway."
00:04:30.353,00:04:32.147,Defying Gravity?
00:04:32.189,00:04:35.692,I have an iPod shuffle dedicated exclusively to selections from Wicked.
00:04:35.734,00:04:37.236,This is amazing.
00:04:37.277,00:04:38.695,"Think you can handle it, Rachel?"
00:04:40.363,00:04:42.323,It's also my ringtone.
00:04:42.365,00:04:45.535,MERCEDES: Why do we have to go all vanilla on this song?
00:04:45.577,00:04:48.413,"See, what we need is my chocolate thunder."
00:04:48.455,00:04:52.542,"Okay, we don't have time to rearrange a song for you, Mercedes."
00:04:52.584,00:04:55.712,"Don't worry, we'll find something for you to dip in chocolate."
00:04:57.297,00:04:58.548,On to item two.
00:04:58.590,00:05:02.719,The school won't pay for the special bus we need to take Artie and his wheelchair with us to Sectionals.
00:05:02.761,00:05:03.804,W-W-What?!
00:05:03.845,00:05:05.180,That's completely unfair.
00:05:05.222,00:05:08.516,So we're going to have to raise money to pay for it ourselves.
00:05:18.235,00:05:19.820,"SANTANA: You're joking, right?"
00:05:19.861,00:05:22.990,"I mean, bake sales are kind of bougie."
00:05:23.031,00:05:26.201,So hip people stopped eating delicious sugary treats?
00:05:26.243,00:05:27.368,It's not that.
00:05:27.410,00:05:29.788,It's most of us don't know how to bake.
00:05:29.830,00:05:32.373,I find recipes confusing.
00:05:32.415,00:05:34.417,My family is fully committed to takeout.
00:05:34.459,00:05:37.462,"Yeah, Mr. Shue, kids are busier than when you went here."
00:05:37.504,00:05:42.259,"We've got homework and football and teen pregnancy, lunch."
00:05:42.301,00:05:44.303,Can't Artie's dad just take him?
00:05:44.343,00:05:46.429,I can't believe how insensitive you're all being.
00:05:47.430,00:05:48.389,Are you a team?
00:05:48.431,00:05:50.100,Of course.
00:05:54.313,00:05:55.563,It's cool.
00:05:55.605,00:05:59.358,Anything that takes away our time from rehearsing doesn't serve the team.
00:06:10.453,00:06:12.622,"Let me help you out, buddy."
00:06:12.664,00:06:15.416,"Hey, I'm really sorry about how they all reacted, Artie."
00:06:15.458,00:06:17.294,"Oh, it's okay."
00:06:17.336,00:06:18.545,They just don't get it.
00:06:21.464,00:06:24.592,"Can I use the auditorium this afternoon to rehearse, Mr. Shue?"
00:06:24.634,00:06:26.261,Some of the band equipment's in there.
00:06:26.303,00:06:27.512,Sure.
00:08:15.287,00:08:16.621,I have something I'd like to say.
00:08:18.581,00:08:21.042,I want to audition for the Wicked solo.
00:08:22.585,00:08:23.795,"Kurt, there's a high F in it."
00:08:23.837,00:08:26.214,That's well within my range.
00:08:26.256,00:08:31.719,"Well, I think Rachel's going to be fine for the female lead, but I'm happy to have you try out something else, Kurt."
00:08:31.761,00:08:33.472,And we'll make sure it's got a killer high note.
00:08:34.764,00:08:37.267,ARTIE: You tried.
00:08:39.311,00:08:47.319,I was a little disappointed at how you were all so willing to take the bus to get to Sectionals and make Artie drive by himself with his dad.
00:08:48.611,00:08:50.655,"We're a team, guys."
00:08:50.697,00:08:52.573,We're in this glee club together.
00:08:52.615,00:08:53.950,Artie doesn't care.
00:08:53.992,00:08:55.285,His dad drives him everywhere.
00:08:55.327,00:08:57.454,I do care.
00:08:57.496,00:08:59.247,It kind of hurt my feelings.
00:08:59.289,00:09:00.748,We didn't think you would take it personally.
00:09:00.790,00:09:05.086,"Well, you're irritating most of the time, but don't take that personally."
00:09:06.296,00:09:09.383,I don't know if you guys really understand how much harder Artie has to work just to keep up.
00:09:10.633,00:09:15.430,We're riding to Sectionals together or we're not going at all.
00:09:15.472,00:09:19.017,"And to pay for the bus, we're having a bake sale."
00:09:20.227,00:09:21.644,Bake sale...
00:09:20.227,00:09:27.526,"St. Ignatius nursing home was having a tag sale, and my AV Club friends here agreed to help out."
00:09:29.528,00:09:36.034,"For the next week, each of you is going to spend three hours a day in a wheelchair."
00:09:48.380,00:10:16.116,BILLY IDOL: PUCK: I didn't even know we had a Home Ec room.
00:10:16.157,00:10:18.659,What's all this?
00:10:18.701,00:10:23.415,Ingredients for cupcakes for the stupid bake sale.
00:10:28.336,00:10:29.670,What's this?
00:10:29.712,00:10:32.090,It's what I have left over from my pool cleaning money.
00:10:32.132,00:10:34.842,After I bought dip and nunchakus.
00:10:34.884,00:10:36.844,I was getting that you kinda need money.
00:10:36.886,00:10:38.305,For our kid.
00:10:38.346,00:10:40.181,For my kid.
00:10:44.352,00:10:47.730,How much has Finn given you?
00:10:47.772,00:10:50.191,Just stop.
00:10:51.109,00:10:59.033,"I told you before, I don't care if that baby comes out with a mohawk, I will go to my grave swearing it's Finn's."
00:11:05.582,00:11:08.418,It would be pretty awesome if it came out with a mohawk.
00:11:11.129,00:11:13.089,You are such an egghead.
00:11:13.131,00:11:15.216,I'm not.
00:11:33.776,00:11:34.735,Ah!
00:11:34.777,00:11:36.446,That was perfectly measured!
00:11:37.780,00:11:38.739,There you go!
00:11:48.249,00:11:49.626,What the hell?
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.261,I'm gonna go change.
00:12:06.100,00:12:08.269,Where's my jelly creme center?
00:12:08.311,00:12:11.147,"Sorry, Dad, I must've forgotten."
00:12:11.189,00:12:12.815,What's up with your brain today?
00:12:12.857,00:12:16.277,"You know, I think it's going soft from all that crap you put in your hair."
00:12:16.319,00:12:19.447,It's organic and I'm fine.
00:12:21.282,00:12:24.285,"I'm sorry, it's a Glee Club thing."
00:12:24.327,00:12:25.828,"It's not about a guy, is it?"
00:12:25.870,00:12:28.623,'Cause I'm not ready to have that conversation.
00:12:28.665,00:12:32.502,"Oh, at least you don't have to worry about me getting someone pregnant."
00:12:34.212,00:12:36.423,It's not a guy.
00:12:36.464,00:12:42.887,"We're doing this amazing song for Sectionals, a personal favorite of mine, and Mr. Schuester won't give me a chance to sing it."
00:12:42.929,00:12:44.264,Why?
00:12:44.305,00:12:46.807,It's traditionally sung by a girl.
00:12:46.849,00:12:48.435,"Well, you sing like a girl."
00:12:48.476,00:12:49.810,"You know, in a good way."
00:12:49.852,00:12:53.440,"Look, Kurt, I don't know how this music stuff works."
00:12:53.481,00:12:59.112,I'm pretty exclusively committed to my Mellencamp collection but isn't there more crossover nowadays?
00:12:59.153,00:13:03.366,"You know, chicks doing construction, guys wearing dress shoes with no socks?"
00:13:04.659,00:13:07.995,Didn't that girl from your high school just join the boy's wrestling team?
00:13:09.456,00:13:10.582,Whoo!
00:13:11.874,00:13:15.503,"Yes, but her parents had to sue the school."
00:13:17.255,00:13:19.840,"This is really getting you down, isn't it?"
00:13:19.882,00:13:22.427,I'm full of ennui.
00:13:30.184,00:13:37.442,"You can't discriminate against my kid because of his sex, religion, political affiliation or the fact that he's queer as a three dollar bill."
00:13:37.484,00:13:38.526,And I won't accept it.
00:13:38.568,00:13:41.154,"This isn't academics or athletics, Mr. Hummel."
00:13:41.195,00:13:45.866,It's an arts program and Mr. Schuester's judgments are subjective.
00:13:50.330,00:13:52.873,Wait.
00:13:52.915,00:13:55.126,I was just going to agree with you.
00:13:55.168,00:14:02.925,"I know this is going to be hard on you, Rachel, but I can't, in good conscience, preach about the importance of helping Artie and then reject Kurt's request out of hand."
00:14:04.927,00:14:06.887,"Now, I can't just give him the part."
00:14:06.929,00:14:09.307,"That would be just as wrong, but I can let him audition."
00:14:09.349,00:14:11.976,"What do you mean, like a tryout?"
00:14:12.018,00:14:13.687,"All right, that seems fair."
00:14:13.728,00:14:16.523,This is totally unfair.
00:14:16.564,00:14:20.360,And I will give it to you again if you can sing the song better than Kurt.
00:14:21.444,00:14:23.571,"Okay, this seems like a reasonable deal."
00:14:23.613,00:14:28.951,But how do I know this isn't just some show to stop me from taking a flamethrower to this place?
00:14:30.244,00:14:32.079,Who's going to judge?
00:14:32.121,00:14:37.918,"Now, all of you are going to judge, and in the spirit of full access, each of you is going to get a vote."
00:14:37.960,00:14:42.215,"Whatever singer has the most votes, gets the part."
00:14:42.256,00:14:43.924,"This isn't going to be about talent, Mr. Schuester."
00:14:43.966,00:14:45.802,It's going to be a popularity contest.
00:14:45.844,00:14:47.679,Stop right there.
00:14:53.976,00:14:56.229,We all know I'm more popular than Rachel.
00:14:56.270,00:14:58.398,And I dress better than her.
00:15:02.402,00:15:05.321,Raise your right hand.
00:15:05.363,00:15:07.198,"Your right hand, Brittany."
00:15:07.240,00:15:09.826,It's this one.
00:15:09.868,00:15:11.118,Repeat after me.
00:15:11.160,00:15:13.371,I promise to vote for whoever sings the song better.
00:15:13.413,00:15:17.792,ALL: I promise to vote for whoever sings the song better.
00:15:21.170,00:15:22.672,It's on.
00:15:26.092,00:15:27.427,"All right, guys."
00:15:33.933,00:15:38.229,Maybe one of these days you'll find a way to create teaching moments without ruining my life.
00:15:48.489,00:15:52.410,"Shue, I saw all your kids in their wheelchairs, and I was very impressed."
00:15:52.452,00:16:00.251,"Well, thank you, Principal Figgins, but actually, it's made me realize that there's only one wheelchair entrance in this school and it's all the way on the far end of campus."
00:16:00.293,00:16:02.837,McKinley needs ramps.
00:16:02.879,00:16:05.005,No way.
00:16:02.879,00:16:06.173,Those are what I call lazy makers.
00:16:06.215,00:16:10.261,They discourage our able-bodied students from getting their proper exercise by using the stairs.
00:16:10.303,00:16:11.429,What is she doing here?
00:16:11.471,00:16:12.889,"Yes, what am I doing here?"
00:16:12.931,00:16:15.308,I have a Cheerios routine to polish that's gonna clinch us Nationals.
00:16:15.349,00:16:18.728,I brought you two in here because both of you have a point.
00:16:18.770,00:16:23.232,"Handicapped ramps are expensive, but inspiration is free."
00:16:24.901,00:16:29.029,"Will, I'm so inspired by your stunt that I'm insisting that Ms. Sylvester do the same with the Cheerios."
00:16:29.071,00:16:30.323,I beg your pardon?
00:16:33.075,00:16:34.661,It's by invitation only.
00:16:39.081,00:16:41.041,"Now, Glee Club held open auditions."
00:16:41.083,00:16:42.919,And everyone got in.
00:16:42.961,00:16:52.345,"Now that Quinn Fabray is off the squad, you will hold open auditions to fill her slot and Mr. Schuester will monitor them to make sure that they are fair to all."
00:16:54.305,00:17:00.728,"There comes a point when you've got to stop seeing people for what they look like, and ask them to show you what they can do."
00:17:00.770,00:17:09.863,"And as soon as a cheerleader rolls herself out onto the field in a wheelchair, she becomes decidedly less effective at cheering people up."
00:17:09.904,00:17:11.155,It's just a fact.
00:17:11.197,00:17:16.410,"No, Sue, the fact is you've never given other students the fair shake that they deserve."
00:17:17.996,00:17:19.079,I'm asking you to try it.
00:17:19.121,00:17:20.414,What do you have to lose?
00:17:20.456,00:17:22.959,Maybe somebody at this school will surprise you.
00:17:25.127,00:17:27.129,FINN: Cupcake?
00:17:29.298,00:17:31.509,These cupcakes suck.
00:17:31.551,00:17:33.970,It's not about the cupcakes.
00:17:34.012,00:17:36.096,Nobody wants to buy from losers.
00:17:36.138,00:17:39.099,We're in Glee Club and in wheelchairs.
00:17:39.141,00:17:40.476,She has a point.
00:17:40.518,00:17:43.354,Six months ago I could've sold 50 of these things on fear alone.
00:17:44.856,00:17:47.274,"Oh, my God."
00:17:47.316,00:17:49.694,I actually think they're kind of friends.
00:17:49.736,00:17:52.321,Brittany is always cheating off her test papers in math class.
00:17:52.363,00:17:54.908,"See, so many?"
00:17:54.949,00:17:56.325,"And look how pretty they are, Becky."
00:17:56.367,00:17:57.785,Wow.
00:17:59.954,00:18:01.330,I lost it.
00:18:01.372,00:18:03.416,Are you a cheerleader?
00:18:03.457,00:18:04.959,It's so cool.
00:18:05.001,00:18:06.168,So is buying a cupcake.
00:18:06.210,00:18:07.294,That's really cool.
00:18:07.336,00:18:09.296,But I don't have any money.
00:18:09.338,00:18:11.007,"That's okay, I have some."
00:18:21.976,00:18:24.144,"So, how much do we have now?"
00:18:27.899,00:18:30.150,This is ridiculous.
00:18:30.192,00:18:34.196,"Well, maybe if we put a jelly bean or something on top we'd sell more."
00:18:34.238,00:18:39.619,How am I supposed to trust you to take care of our baby when you can't even figure out how to sell a damn cupcake?
00:18:39.660,00:18:41.328,Stop attacking me.
00:18:41.370,00:18:42.538,Get a job.
00:18:42.580,00:18:43.247,I'm trying!
00:18:54.425,00:18:56.176,SUE: I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing here.
00:18:56.218,00:18:59.055,"You just call a name, they come in and try out."
00:18:59.097,00:19:00.765,Just give them a chance to express themselves.
00:19:00.807,00:19:04.184,I'm about to projectile express myself all over your Hush Puppies.
00:19:04.226,00:19:06.646,"McKinley, hey, hey."
00:19:09.231,00:19:10.108,No.
00:19:15.321,00:19:16.489,No.
00:19:18.157,00:19:19.325,"You're not serious, are you?"
00:19:25.039,00:19:25.665,No.
00:19:26.415,00:19:28.459,"No friggin' way, Jacob."
00:19:37.718,00:19:39.219,Freak!
00:19:41.097,00:19:43.265,"Okay, I've been at this for an hour, that's all I promised."
00:19:45.267,00:19:47.227,Give her a shot.
00:19:47.269,00:19:48.479,Becky Johnson!
00:19:48.521,00:19:50.564,Jackson.
00:19:55.695,00:19:58.739,I heard that you're doing a routine with jump ropes.
00:19:58.781,00:20:00.992,I wanted to show you what I can do.
00:20:12.753,00:20:14.964,"Becky, I'm going to stop you right there."
00:20:16.340,00:20:18.258,You're in.
00:20:18.300,00:20:20.302,Be at practice tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.
00:20:20.344,00:20:21.929,Congratulations.
00:20:31.397,00:20:34.108,And I found myself a brand-new Cheerio.
00:20:34.150,00:20:36.527,You're up to something.
00:20:42.366,00:20:45.203,"I'm just saying, she has a point."
00:20:45.244,00:20:46.954,You are kind of an idiot.
00:20:46.996,00:20:48.288,"Nice support, dude."
00:20:51.333,00:20:52.710,And you haven't done spit to take care of it.
00:20:54.336,00:20:55.671,Damn straight.
00:20:55.713,00:20:57.173,Nobody's hiring.
00:20:57.215,00:21:02.261,"Sell your Xbox, rob a bank, go all Robin Hood on this joint, whatever it takes."
00:21:03.345,00:21:07.474,All I ever hear is you whining and crying about how hard this is on you.
00:21:07.516,00:21:08.308,What about her?
00:21:08.350,00:21:10.186,"Dude, you are so out of line!"
00:21:15.357,00:21:16.817,You're a punk!
00:21:27.787,00:21:29.038,"WILL: Hey, hey, break it up!"
00:21:29.080,00:21:30.330,Break it up!
00:21:30.372,00:21:31.791,Come on!
00:21:31.832,00:21:33.042,Hey!
00:21:33.084,00:21:34.334,I don't care!
00:21:36.378,00:21:38.756,You-you guys are best friends.
00:21:44.386,00:21:46.764,"I really like Artie, okay?"
00:21:49.267,00:21:51.269,You okay?
00:22:01.403,00:22:07.326,"You push with the right wheel and pull as hard as you can with the left, and find a spot on the wall to spot you, so you don't get dizzy."
00:22:13.666,00:22:16.085,"WILL: Okay, guys, take five, all right?"
00:22:16.127,00:22:18.671,"Oh, remember to show up early on Thursday."
00:22:18.712,00:22:21.715,It's Rachel versus Kurt for the big solo.
00:22:25.427,00:22:26.386,Careful.
00:22:26.428,00:22:29.347,ARTIE: Respect the chair.
00:22:33.477,00:22:35.395,"I really admire you, Artie."
00:22:35.437,00:22:38.565,I had no idea how difficult this was.
00:22:38.607,00:22:40.400,It's just like you with your stutter.
00:22:40.442,00:22:43.321,You don't really notice it after awhile.
00:22:47.449,00:22:49.451,You don't talk about it.
00:22:49.493,00:22:53.289,My mom and I got in a really bad car accident when I was eight.
00:22:53.331,00:22:56.834,"And she was fine, but I've been in the chair ever since."
00:22:56.876,00:23:02.422,But I want to be very clear-- I still have the use of my penis.
00:23:31.493,00:23:34.454,Excuse me a second.
00:23:47.385,00:23:48.468,Hummel Tire and Lube.
00:23:48.510,00:23:50.470,Yeah. Who is this?
00:23:52.973,00:23:54.474,MAN: Your son's a fag.
00:24:02.566,00:24:04.484,"KURT: Hey, Dad."
00:24:04.526,00:24:06.528,What the hell is wrong with this machine?
00:24:06.570,00:24:08.322,"I hit it, the high F."
00:24:08.364,00:24:10.490,The magical note I need for Defying Gravity.
00:24:11.449,00:24:12.492,It means I'm going to win.
00:24:12.534,00:24:13.535,That's great.
00:24:15.537,00:24:16.705,What's going on?
00:24:17.957,00:24:19.792,I got a phone call this morning.
00:24:19.833,00:24:21.252,The anonymous kind.
00:24:22.544,00:24:25.172,It was some dude telling me my son was a fag.
00:24:26.548,00:24:28.092,"Well, that's not a big deal."
00:24:29.551,00:24:31.511,"Yeah, but I don't."
00:24:31.553,00:24:33.139,"Now look, Kurt, I..."
00:24:33.180,00:24:35.682,"I try to do right by you-- you know, open some doors."
00:24:35.724,00:24:37.517,What father wouldn't do that for his kid?
00:24:37.559,00:24:42.315,And I know it's good for you to be out there with all this glee club stuff.
00:24:42.356,00:24:46.526,I just... I don't want you to get hurt.
00:24:46.568,00:24:50.448,So you don't want me to audition for the solo?
00:24:50.488,00:24:51.991,"No, no, let me be clear, all right?"
00:24:52.032,00:24:54.160,No one pushes the Hummels around.
00:24:54.201,00:24:55.953,Especially cowards on the phone.
00:25:00.291,00:25:03.543,"Sometimes I just... I wish your mom was still around, you know?"
00:25:03.585,00:25:10.508,"She was better at handling this kind of thing, you know, handling me."
00:25:12.510,00:25:15.055,"Well, congrats on, uh..."
00:25:15.097,00:25:18.934,"you know, the cool A or the high C or whatever."
00:25:18.976,00:25:20.518,Yeah.
00:25:28.486,00:25:31.405,There's your problem.
00:25:31.447,00:25:33.573,Good as new.
00:25:33.615,00:25:35.409,"Thanks, Finn."
00:25:41.623,00:25:42.500,Don't be.
00:25:42.540,00:25:44.626,I don't want to win out of charity.
00:25:44.668,00:25:47.587,I want to win the solo because it's right for the club.
00:25:47.629,00:25:53.177,I really think that the judges at Sectionals will find a female version of Defying Gravity much more accessible.
00:25:57.639,00:25:59.892,People just don't like me.
00:25:59.933,00:26:02.895,"Yeah, you might want to work on that."
00:26:04.646,00:26:07.149,But I like you.
00:26:09.693,00:26:11.611,I'll get out of your way.
00:26:11.653,00:26:13.030,"No, you stay."
00:26:13.072,00:26:14.448,Do you know what this is?
00:26:14.490,00:26:15.699,"Oh, it's just a past due notice."
00:26:15.741,00:26:17.410,My mom gets them all the time.
00:26:22.331,00:26:23.916,You will get cut off.
00:26:23.957,00:26:25.667,"You need to help me with this, Finn."
00:26:25.709,00:26:28.586,Or else we're going to go our separate ways.
00:26:32.341,00:26:34.427,I'm screwed.
00:26:34.468,00:26:37.179,Not necessarily.
00:26:47.481,00:26:49.316,"I know, I know, I know, I know."
00:26:49.358,00:26:51.110,"Hey. Hey, guys."
00:26:51.151,00:26:52.486,SANTANA: Hi.
00:26:52.528,00:26:54.654,Puck found his Nana Connie's old recipe.
00:26:54.696,00:26:56.574,They're addictive.
00:26:57.699,00:26:59.659,Don't want to take one away from a paying customer.
00:26:59.701,00:27:01.495,"Yeah, no, sure."
00:27:01.537,00:27:02.496,"Hey, nice work, buddy."
00:27:02.538,00:27:05.583,These are so good.
00:27:05.623,00:27:07.751,PUCK: This isn't Nana Connie's old recipe.
00:27:07.793,00:27:09.669,She couldn't cook at all.
00:27:09.711,00:27:13.673,"She was a diabetic, so the only sweets she had in her house was dried fruit."
00:27:13.715,00:27:17.677,I knew I had to do something to help Quinn out with our baby.
00:27:17.719,00:27:23.058,"I don't know what kind of stuff you need for a baby that's still in your stomach-- bottles, diapers, that kind of thing, I guess."
00:27:23.100,00:27:28.397,But my baby mama was going to get it all.
00:27:28.439,00:27:34.612,"To make sure that happened, I used the two things I know the most about-- lying and crime."
00:27:34.652,00:27:36.696,"Is there a lot of pain, Noah?"
00:27:36.738,00:27:39.699,The doctor said the shark fractured my spinal cord.
00:27:39.741,00:27:42.119,This is why I don't go to the aquarium.
00:27:42.161,00:27:47.291,"I'm going to give you as much as you want, 20 cents on the dollar."
00:27:47.333,00:27:52.588,"PUCK: I don't put in enough to get you hallucinating, just enough to give you a wicked case of the munchies."
00:27:52.630,00:27:55.341,That's why they keep coming back for more.
00:27:55.382,00:27:59.386,"See, I told you I'd make a great dad."
00:27:59.428,00:28:01.388,SUE: Faster.
00:28:01.430,00:28:02.680,Harder.
00:28:04.391,00:28:07.603,"Those better be tears of joy, Becky."
00:28:07.645,00:28:09.938,Faster!
00:28:09.980,00:28:11.231,"Okay, stop."
00:28:11.273,00:28:13.691,"Becky, this is terrible."
00:28:14.985,00:28:16.028,"I tried, Coach."
00:28:16.069,00:28:17.737,This is really hard.
00:28:17.779,00:28:18.738,You think this is hard?
00:28:18.780,00:28:22.535,Try auditioning for Baywatch and being told that they're going in another direction.
00:28:22.576,00:28:23.743,That was hard.
00:28:23.785,00:28:24.744,Hit the showers.
00:28:24.786,00:28:26.539,"Thanks, Coach."
00:28:34.796,00:28:36.714,Hi.
00:28:40.802,00:28:42.638,"Sue, you are unbelievable."
00:28:42.680,00:28:44.682,And you are a terrible spy.
00:28:44.723,00:28:47.059,You might try breathing through your nose sometime.
00:28:47.100,00:28:49.853,"If you were a sniper, I would have already radioed in your coordinates."
00:28:49.895,00:28:51.230,Just like in the Falklands.
00:28:51.271,00:28:52.814,"I'm not going to let you bully that girl, Sue."
00:28:52.856,00:28:54.400,"Oh, I bully everybody, Will."
00:28:54.441,00:28:55.817,It's the way I roll.
00:28:55.859,00:28:56.860,"Yeah, but this is different."
00:28:58.820,00:29:00.780,"I want you to listen to what you just said, William."
00:29:00.822,00:29:03.659,You're asking me to treat this girl differently because she has a disability.
00:29:06.704,00:29:07.787,Why are you doing this?
00:29:10.832,00:29:14.294,You don't know the first thing about me.
00:29:24.555,00:29:26.806,Good luck.
00:29:26.848,00:29:29.226,I'm rooting for you.
00:29:32.563,00:29:38.402,"All right, welcome to the glee club's first official diva-off."
00:29:39.945,00:29:41.947,Let's get this party started.
00:32:12.472,00:32:13.515,"WILLIAM: Good job, Kurt."
00:32:19.271,00:32:21.231,"Hey, wait up."
00:32:21.273,00:32:23.442,I cracked open the piggy bank.
00:32:23.483,00:32:24.610,It's for you.
00:32:24.651,00:32:25.569,"Well, it's for it."
00:32:25.611,00:32:27.987,It is a she.
00:32:28.029,00:32:30.824,Cool.
00:32:30.866,00:32:32.158,I told you I wasn't a deadbeat.
00:32:32.200,00:32:35.245,"Look, Puck, this is really sweet, but..."
00:32:35.287,00:32:38.290,I can get more.
00:32:41.209,00:32:45.589,"I think school's for suckers, but I got ambition."
00:32:45.631,00:32:47.006,I can get us a house.
00:32:47.048,00:32:48.091,Some stuff.
00:32:48.133,00:32:50.093,Furniture.
00:32:50.135,00:32:51.553,We could be a family.
00:32:59.060,00:33:00.228,He'd bake me a damn cake.
00:33:02.105,00:33:04.483,You stole from the cupcake fund.
00:33:04.524,00:33:05.859,"No, I didn't."
00:33:09.321,00:33:10.697,I made all those cupcakes.
00:33:11.657,00:33:14.743,"I'm all about being a team player, but my family comes first."
00:33:16.161,00:33:17.454,I get it.
00:33:17.496,00:33:21.040,And I'm sorry.
00:33:21.082,00:33:23.627,I should have never called you a Lima loser.
00:33:23.669,00:33:25.462,You're not.
00:33:25.504,00:33:36.598,You're special and a romantic and a good enough person to realize that we are not going to take money from a friend in a wheelchair.
00:33:37.891,00:33:39.559,Hey.
00:33:43.396,00:33:45.148,Here.
00:33:45.190,00:33:46.525,What's this?
00:33:46.566,00:33:48.318,I got a job.
00:33:48.360,00:33:50.904,Excuse me.
00:33:50.946,00:33:52.364,Are you the manager?
00:33:52.405,00:33:53.991,You need to hire my friend Finn.
00:33:54.032,00:33:58.537,He is clearly handi-capable and refusing to hire him could be seen as discrimination.
00:33:58.578,00:34:05.043,"My dads are gay and unless you want the full force of the American Civil Liberties Union coming down on you, I'd work something out."
00:34:06.545,00:34:11.633,"I'm going to need to stay in my wheelchair as long as I'm working there, but screw it, it's worth it."
00:34:12.634,00:34:13.969,Can I give you a lift to rehearsal?
00:34:30.402,00:34:31.987,"1,200 bucks."
00:34:30.402,00:34:34.155,That's enough for the short bus and two cases of Natty Light for the ride home.
00:34:34.197,00:34:35.323,"Oh, dream on, buddy."
00:34:39.828,00:34:41.747,I'm very proud of you guys.
00:34:46.418,00:34:48.378,why don't you bring this to Principal Figgins yourself?
00:34:50.171,00:34:52.215,"All right, Artie!"
00:34:54.426,00:34:56.011,"What's wrong, dude?"
00:34:56.053,00:35:01.140,"I really appreciate what you guys did for me, but I'm not the only kid in a wheelchair at this school."
00:35:01.182,00:35:05.771,And I'm sure there will be others after I graduate.
00:35:05.812,00:35:15.447,"And I know how important it is for all of us to go to Sectionals together, but I think I'd rather just get a ride from my dad and use this for a handicapped ramp in the auditorium."
00:35:16.823,00:35:18.450,Any objections?
00:35:29.210,00:35:30.169,That can cause erratic behavior.
00:35:30.211,00:35:37.552,All I know is that she walked in unannounced and she wrote me a check for three new handicapped ramps.
00:35:37.594,00:35:39.220,I just don't get it.
00:35:39.262,00:35:42.181,"I mean, first putting Becky in Cheerios, now this."
00:35:42.223,00:35:43.809,What is her angle?
00:35:43.850,00:35:45.268,Why ask why?
00:35:45.310,00:35:48.146,Just enjoy the fact that you're getting your bus after all.
00:35:53.234,00:35:54.611,How's she doing?
00:35:54.653,00:35:56.655,She asks about you.
00:35:56.696,00:35:58.281,She's been watching you on TV.
00:35:58.323,00:36:00.575,I need to get here more often.
00:36:00.617,00:36:02.744,"Oh, you get here plenty."
00:36:04.245,00:36:05.204,Jean?
00:36:05.246,00:36:07.206,Your little sister's here to see you.
00:36:07.248,00:36:09.042,"Hey, Sue!"
00:36:09.084,00:36:10.627,My sister is famous.
00:36:10.669,00:36:11.920,You got that right.
00:36:11.962,00:36:13.922,I got something for you.
00:36:16.341,00:36:18.718,Wow! A pom-pom!
00:36:18.760,00:36:19.719,That's for you.
00:36:19.761,00:36:21.220,What do you feel like doing today?
00:36:21.262,00:36:22.848,Can we read today?
00:36:22.889,00:36:23.890,Look what I have!
00:36:23.932,00:36:25.224,Little Red Riding Hood!
00:36:25.266,00:36:27.226,Right. Your favorite book.
00:36:27.268,00:36:28.394,Want to start at the beginning?
00:36:28.436,00:36:30.313,Yes.
00:36:30.355,00:36:31.648,You ready?
00:36:31.690,00:36:34.151,Ready.
00:36:41.992,00:36:49.082,"Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in the forest."
00:36:49.124,00:36:59.258,"Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood."
00:37:03.471,00:37:04.931,"Oh, no!"
00:37:04.973,00:37:06.474,"Oh, you're so much faster!"
00:37:06.516,00:37:08.685,You can't keep up?
00:37:08.727,00:37:11.521,I can't. This is so hard. No.
00:37:11.563,00:37:13.648,No f-f-fair!
00:37:13.690,00:37:15.274,You have eight years of practice!
00:37:18.319,00:37:19.654,It's like your stutter.
00:37:19.696,00:37:23.282,It's mostly just a big hassle.
00:37:30.331,00:37:31.541,Why?
00:37:31.583,00:37:35.587,So I can do this.
00:37:48.850,00:37:50.309,I have to tell you something.
00:37:51.352,00:37:54.564,I've been faking it.
00:37:54.606,00:37:56.399,Faking what?
00:37:56.441,00:37:58.359,I don't have a stutter.
00:38:07.285,00:38:13.917,"I was really shy, and it made people think I was weird, so they left me alone."
00:38:13.959,00:38:21.424,And it wasn't until I joined Glee Club that I realized how much I was missing.
00:38:21.466,00:38:23.093,And I don't want to push people away anymore.
00:38:24.677,00:38:26.638,"You understand what that's like, don't you?"
00:38:26.679,00:38:29.432,"No, I don't."
00:38:30.767,00:38:34.646,I would never try to push people away 'cause being in a chair kind of does that for you.
00:38:36.397,00:38:38.900,I thought we had something really important in common.
00:38:42.612,00:38:45.824,"Wait, Artie. I'm sorry."
00:38:45.865,00:38:47.659,"I am, too."
00:38:47.700,00:38:52.580,I'm sorry now you get to be normal and I'm going to be stuck in this chair the rest of my life.
00:38:52.622,00:38:54.666,And that's not something I can fake.
00:39:02.423,00:39:03.591,"Hey, Dad."
00:39:03.633,00:39:04.843,What are you doing?
00:39:06.594,00:39:07.637,How did the tryout go?
00:39:08.513,00:39:11.224,They gave the part to Rachel.
00:39:11.266,00:39:12.684,I knew they were going to rig it.
00:39:12.725,00:39:15.687,I'm going down to that school and I'm talking to Schuester.
00:39:15.728,00:39:18.023,I blew the note.
00:39:19.065,00:39:20.608,I wanted to lose.
00:39:20.650,00:39:24.696,"Kurt, I stuck my neck out for you, and you go and you throw the game?"
00:39:28.616,00:39:33.621,"Dad, I've known who I was since I was five."
00:39:33.663,00:39:35.874,I adapted.
00:39:37.458,00:39:43.256,"And at the end of the day, it's what's going to get me out of this cow town."
00:39:43.298,00:39:44.590,You never had to do that.
00:39:44.632,00:39:46.509,I can handle myself just fine.
00:39:46.551,00:39:48.594,"No, you can't."
00:39:48.636,00:39:50.347,Not about this.
00:39:51.681,00:39:54.309,That phone call yesterday was just the beginning.
00:39:54.351,00:39:57.979,Especially if I get up in front of a thousand people to sing a girl's song.
00:39:59.480,00:40:08.781,"When I saw you right after you got the call, and you were so hurt and so upset..."
00:40:13.494,00:40:14.996,...it just killed me.
00:40:16.748,00:40:19.125,I'm not saying I'm going to hide in the closet.
00:40:20.793,00:40:25.173,I'm-I'm proud of who I am.
00:40:25.215,00:40:29.802,I'm just saying that I love you more than I love being a star.
00:40:31.721,00:40:34.349,You are your mother.
00:40:34.391,00:40:38.770,"You know, she was always the strong one."
00:40:38.811,00:40:43.649,"Look, uh, You want to help me put a 195 on this bad boy, huh?"
00:40:43.691,00:40:45.777,Let me change into my coveralls.
00:40:45.818,00:40:47.946,This sweater's an Alexander McQueen.
00:41:00.625,00:41:03.336,"This one's for you, Artie!"
00:41:07.632,00:00:05.422,"BOTH: Here's what you missed last week: Quinn's pregnant, and Puck's the father, but everybody thinks it's Finn."
00:00:05.505,00:00:07.924,You're a punk who doesn't deserve to have Quinn as his girlfriend.
00:00:11.136,00:00:12.929,They just know she's in the Celibacy Club.
00:00:13.013,00:00:14.180,"Well, call the Vatican!"
00:00:16.141,00:00:17.434,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:22.772,00:00:24.941,Ballad.
00:00:25.025,00:00:28.653,"From Middle English, balade."
00:00:28.737,00:00:30.655,Who knows what this word means?
00:00:30.739,00:00:31.823,It's a male duck.
00:00:31.906,00:00:32.949,Kurt.
00:00:33.033,00:00:35.577,A ballad is a love song.
00:00:35.660,00:00:38.371,"Sometimes, but they don't always express love."
00:00:38.455,00:00:43.585,Ballads are stories set to music-- which is why they're the perfect storm of self-expression.
00:00:43.668,00:00:47.964,Stories and music are the way we express feelings that we can't get out any other way.
00:00:48.048,00:00:54.345,"Okay, now, sectionals are in a few weeks and there's a new rule this year-- we have to perform... a ballad."
00:00:54.429,00:00:58.767,Looks like my weekly letter to the Ohio Show Choir Committee finally paid off!
00:00:58.850,00:01:04.981,"Okay. So here's our assignment for the week: I'm going to pair you off, and I want you to pick a ballad to sing to your partner."
00:01:05.065,00:01:09.694,"Look them right in the eye, find the emotion you want to express, and make them feel it."
00:01:09.778,00:01:11.988,I pick Quinn.
00:01:13.198,00:01:14.199,Too easy.
00:01:14.282,00:01:16.701,Your partners will be chosen by fate.
00:01:16.785,00:01:18.495,"ALL: Ooh! Ooh, yeah."
00:01:18.578,00:01:19.996,I put all your names in this hat.
00:01:20.080,00:01:21.956,Whoever you choose is your partner.
00:01:23.958,00:01:25.502,SANTANA: But Matt's out sick today.
00:01:25.585,00:01:28.755,"He had to go to the hospital, 'cause they found a spider in his ear."
00:01:28.838,00:01:32.383,Um... I guess I'll just have to put my name in the hat for now.
00:01:32.467,00:01:34.803,Who's up first?
00:01:36.304,00:01:38.932,Mercedes.
00:01:39.015,00:01:39.891,WILL: All right.
00:01:40.809,00:01:42.435,Quinn.
00:01:46.064,00:01:46.940,Kurt.
00:01:50.068,00:01:51.778,"Mr. Shue, I don't know if I can do this with another guy."
00:01:51.861,00:01:53.488,"The fates have spoken, Finn."
00:01:55.323,00:01:57.033,Other Asian.
00:01:57.992,00:01:59.953,Brittany.
00:02:01.621,00:02:02.997,How fitting. Yay!
00:02:03.081,00:02:04.999,No way.
00:02:05.083,00:02:06.835,"Looks like I get you, Mr. Shue."
00:02:07.836,00:02:09.587,Uh... you know what?
00:02:09.671,00:02:11.840,Maybe we should just wait until Matt gets back.
00:02:11.923,00:02:13.800,"The fates talked, Mr. Shue."
00:02:15.343,00:02:17.762,Would you mind clarifying what kinds of songs you want us to sing?
00:02:17.846,00:02:20.431,Why don't you let Mr. Schuester and I demonstrate.
00:02:20.515,00:02:22.767,"Brad, Endless Love in B-flat, please."
00:02:22.851,00:02:24.477,It's my favorite duet.
00:02:24.561,00:02:27.772,"I really don't think that's an appropriate song, Rachel."
00:02:27.856,00:02:30.608,"Why? It's a great song, and it's a perfect ballad."
00:02:43.913,00:02:46.708,KURT: I could totally sing this song with Finn.
00:02:46.791,00:02:49.794,But screw him if he's thinks he's taking the Diana Ross part from me.
00:02:54.048,00:02:55.884,PUCK: I love the days when I don't wear underwear.
00:02:58.303,00:03:00.513,FINN: I never noticed how nice Rachel's butt is.
00:03:00.597,00:03:02.807,"Oh, crap, I think Quinn knows I'm staring at it."
00:03:44.933,00:03:45.934,RACHEL: Wow.
00:03:46.017,00:03:51.481,"I've never noticed this before, because he's always trying to destroy my career, but Mr. Shue has really pretty eyes."
00:03:54.943,00:03:56.319,And really nice teeth.
00:03:56.402,00:03:59.030,"He's obviously invested in good oral hygiene, and that's important to me."
00:03:59.113,00:04:01.157,It shows wonderful self-esteem.
00:04:09.958,00:04:12.961,WILL: I don't like the way she's looking at me.
00:04:13.044,00:04:14.879,"Oh, I shouldn't have sungthis song to her."
00:04:14.963,00:04:16.881,Crap! She lookscrazy right now.
00:04:16.965,00:04:19.759,I knowthis look.
00:04:53.001,00:04:54.294,"RACHEL: Okay, this is amazing."
00:04:54.377,00:04:57.922,"When I'm singing with him, it's like I'm seeing him for the first time."
00:04:58.006,00:05:03.928,And what I'm seeing is super... super cute.
00:05:06.889,00:05:07.724,Okay.
00:05:07.807,00:05:08.766,Something like that.
00:05:18.026,00:05:22.113,"Sweetie, I' m so proud of you."
00:05:23.906,00:05:26.951,The Chastity Ball is so important to your father.
00:05:27.035,00:05:30.955,"QUINN: God, I miss the firm support of my polyester Cheerios uniform!"
00:05:31.039,00:05:33.958,The control panel hid my baby bump perfectly.
00:05:35.335,00:05:36.961,That's odd.
00:05:37.045,00:05:38.046,We had this custom-made a month ago.
00:05:38.129,00:05:40.840,I had a really big lunch today at school.
00:05:40.923,00:05:42.925,Really big tacos.
00:05:46.054,00:05:47.972,"No worries, sweetie."
00:05:48.056,00:05:50.016,I'll just take it down to the tailor tomorrow.
00:05:50.099,00:05:51.017,We'll let it out a little bit.
00:05:51.100,00:05:57.023,"The problem here, honey, is, you know, I just don't think you've been getting enough exercise ever since you quit the Cheerios."
00:05:57.106,00:05:58.024,Am I right? Yeah.
00:05:58.107,00:05:59.442,Yeah. That's right.
00:05:59.525,00:06:08.951,"I mean, you used to spend hours every day doing backflips and high kicks, and now, I mean, now you spend all your free time sitting on a stool in the dark singing show tunes."
00:06:09.035,00:06:11.204,Do you know how many calories you burn singing?
00:06:11.287,00:06:12.163,Hmm?
00:06:12.372,00:06:13.998,Not very many. RUSSELL: Judy!
00:06:14.123,00:06:15.541,Glenn Beck is on!
00:06:16.793,00:06:19.003,Oh! Wait. Hold on.
00:06:20.254,00:06:21.923,"Oh, I don't want to see!"
00:06:22.006,00:06:24.008,"Daddy, it's not like we're getting married."
00:06:24.092,00:06:26.010,I don't want-- oh.
00:06:27.303,00:06:30.181,"Oh, look at you."
00:06:30.264,00:06:35.937,"Speaking of getting married, how's that boy you've been dating? Yeah. Yeah."
00:06:36.020,00:06:38.481,"He's not, uh, pressuring you at all, is he?"
00:06:38.564,00:06:40.024,No!
00:06:40.108,00:06:41.484,"No, he's a gentleman."
00:06:41.567,00:06:43.027,I'm glad to hear that. Mm-hmm.
00:06:43.111,00:06:45.405,That's why I'm inviting him over for dinner on Sunday. Oh!
00:06:45.488,00:06:47.031,Wonderful. Refresher?
00:06:47.115,00:06:50.034,"Honey, I don't want you to lift a finger for me."
00:06:50.118,00:06:51.035,Tsk.
00:06:51.119,00:06:52.036,I'm your wife.
00:06:54.122,00:06:55.289,My little lemon drop. Oh!
00:07:04.549,00:07:06.217,Mr. Schuester? Yeah?
00:07:06.300,00:07:10.096,I just wanted to confirm that we're set to rehearse our ballad at 4:00 sharp this afternoon.
00:07:10.179,00:07:11.764,Oh.
00:07:11.848,00:07:13.057,Isn't Matt back yet?
00:07:13.141,00:07:15.059,"No, it's just..."
00:07:15.143,00:07:18.020,"you and me, all week long."
00:07:18.104,00:07:19.981,Great.
00:07:20.064,00:07:22.066,Well... I'll see you at 4:00.
00:07:26.362,00:07:27.905,Is there something else?
00:07:27.989,00:07:30.074,I just wanted to give you this.
00:07:34.036,00:07:35.413,Open it.
00:07:36.664,00:07:40.376,Gold stars are kind of my signature thing.
00:07:40.460,00:07:46.883,"I figure every time you wear it, you can think of me and the star you're helping me become."
00:07:46.966,00:07:48.092,WILL: It's happening...
00:07:48.176,00:07:49.719,again.
00:07:49.802,00:07:53.097,It always starts with a novelty gift.
00:07:53.181,00:07:55.016,"I mean, you can't blame her, Will."
00:07:55.099,00:07:59.604,"I mean, if we were going to rank crushworthy teachers at this school, you'd be number one with a bullet."
00:08:02.231,00:08:04.192,"Uh... well, I..."
00:08:04.275,00:08:06.360,"when did, when did this start with Rachel?"
00:08:06.444,00:08:09.739,We sang a duet in Glee Club-- Endless Love.
00:08:09.822,00:08:13.326,"Okay, in hindsight, that was probably a mistake."
00:08:13.409,00:08:14.619,Yeah.
00:08:14.702,00:08:16.954,I can't handle going through this again.
00:08:17.038,00:08:19.373,"Sorry, going through, um, going through what again?"
00:08:19.457,00:08:22.126,Have I ever told you about...
00:08:22.210,00:08:24.128,Suzy Pepper?
00:08:25.213,00:08:29.383,"So the alpacas start there and, uh, travel down towards Guadalajara."
00:08:29.467,00:08:34.388,"Suzy Pepper wasn't the first schoolgirl crush, but she was the hardest."
00:08:34.472,00:08:37.391,"It happened about two years ago, before you were a teacher here."
00:08:37.475,00:08:39.393,Suzy was... unique.
00:08:39.477,00:08:42.438,"Mr. Shue, how do you conjugate the verb..."
00:08:42.522,00:08:44.649,to love?
00:08:56.244,00:08:57.828,Peppers.
00:08:57.912,00:09:01.457,So you can wear them and think of me-- Suzy Pepper.
00:09:01.541,00:09:05.169,"I thought it would burn out like the others, but it only got worse."
00:09:07.255,00:09:09.173,Hello?
00:09:10.675,00:09:11.842,Who is it? Who died?
00:09:14.095,00:09:15.763,Suzy Pepper?
00:09:15.846,00:09:18.849,You knew it was me just by the sound of my breath.
00:09:18.933,00:09:20.768,That's so romantic.
00:09:20.851,00:09:23.854,"Listen, you little psycho, this is Will's wife."
00:09:23.938,00:09:28.192,"And if I don't get enough sleep, my anti-depressants won't work, and then I'll go crazy and I'll kill you."
00:09:28.276,00:09:30.236,Terri... Stop calling!
00:09:32.280,00:09:35.199,"Can't you handle anything, Will?"
00:09:36.701,00:09:39.078,or so I thought.
00:09:39.161,00:09:43.040,"I decided to be honest with Suzy, face this head-on."
00:09:43.124,00:09:44.250,Okay. How'd that go?
00:10:17.533,00:10:19.327,It was the world's hottest pepper.
00:10:19.410,00:10:21.495,"She had it shipped from Sinaloa, Mexico. Oh, no."
00:10:21.579,00:10:22.747,"Oh, gosh. What happened to her?"
00:10:22.830,00:10:24.498,"Well, the ambulance arrived just in time."
00:10:24.582,00:10:26.250,The pepper burned holes in her esophagus.
00:10:26.334,00:10:29.253,And she was in a medically induced coma for three days.
00:10:29.337,00:10:32.048,That's why I can't just tell Rachel to back off.
00:10:32.131,00:10:34.091,These girls are too fragile.
00:10:34.175,00:10:36.010,Wow. Okay.
00:10:36.093,00:10:37.053,How about this?
00:10:38.763,00:10:40.514,Right? Do what you told the kids to do.
00:10:40.598,00:10:46.437,"If you're... if you're feeling awkward telling Rachel how you feel, then why don't you, um, you know, sing it to her?"
00:10:46.520,00:10:47.855,Let her down gently.
00:10:49.190,00:10:50.149,And don't wear that tie.
00:10:53.527,00:10:57.281,Sing to me everything you feel.
00:10:57.365,00:11:01.202,Okay.
00:11:01.285,00:11:03.287,Uh...
00:11:06.165,00:11:07.166,I can't. I can't.
00:11:07.249,00:11:08.501,I can't sing to a dude.
00:11:08.584,00:11:09.877,You have to try.
00:11:09.960,00:11:10.878,"I can't, okay!"
00:11:10.961,00:11:11.879,I can't!
00:11:11.962,00:11:16.008,I'm sick and tired of people pushing me to be somebody I'm not.
00:11:18.052,00:11:22.390,Your lashing out at me is fantastically compelling and inappropriate.
00:11:22.473,00:11:25.101,"Dude, I'm sorry."
00:11:25.184,00:11:26.936,"You're really awesome, Kurt."
00:11:27.019,00:11:28.104,I...
00:11:28.187,00:11:30.439,I'm just under a load of crap right now.
00:11:31.399,00:11:32.566,Girls.
00:11:32.650,00:11:34.402,They're your problem.
00:11:34.485,00:11:37.029,"They're up, they're down."
00:11:47.206,00:11:49.667,It's the baby.
00:11:51.001,00:11:53.838,"She's my daughter, and..."
00:11:53.921,00:11:57.925,"there's so many things I want to say to her, and I'm never going to be able to."
00:11:59.677,00:12:01.554,Like what?
00:12:01.637,00:12:03.305,Well...
00:12:03.389,00:12:08.144,like how I don't want her to think that her father just abandoned her.
00:12:08.227,00:12:10.187,How I would do anything for her.
00:12:10.271,00:12:13.858,"How, no matter what I do, I'm always thinking about her."
00:12:15.234,00:12:19.864,"How I'm going to spend my whole life loving her, and she's never even going to know."
00:12:21.741,00:12:23.743,You got to let it out.
00:12:28.122,00:12:30.458,How?
00:12:31.500,00:12:33.169,By singing.
00:12:33.252,00:12:35.421,I'll Stand By You by the Pretenders.
00:12:35.504,00:12:40.176,"It's in your wheelhouse, and I know you know it from the radio because it's a classic."
00:12:40.259,00:12:43.971,"And you do well with the classics, especially in the soft rock mode."
00:12:44.054,00:12:46.974,"Yeah, I do like that song, but..."
00:12:49.894,00:12:51.896,By singing it out.
00:12:51.979,00:12:54.190,To the audience.
00:12:54.273,00:12:57.485,Imagine your little girl sitting there.
00:12:59.153,00:13:02.156,Thank God I never missed a piano lesson.
00:14:19.066,00:14:21.193,"Finn, what's going on?"
00:14:27.366,00:14:28.868,What are you doing?
00:14:28.951,00:14:30.202,"Uh, nothing."
00:14:34.540,00:14:37.251,Were you just singing to a sonogram?
00:14:38.294,00:14:39.795,Uh-huh.
00:14:56.228,00:14:58.564,Is Quinn pregnant?
00:15:01.025,00:15:02.026,I'm sorry.
00:15:02.109,00:15:02.943,I'm so sorry.
00:15:03.027,00:15:04.111,"Shh, shh, shh."
00:15:04.194,00:15:06.697,"I screwed up, Mom."
00:15:06.780,00:15:08.782,It's going to be okay.
00:15:08.866,00:15:11.076,"I'm so sorry. Shh, shh, shh."
00:15:17.082,00:15:18.042,I can't believe you told your mom.
00:15:18.125,00:15:19.543,What if she tells my mom?
00:15:19.627,00:15:20.961,"No, she's not. Half the school knows. Your mom knows."
00:15:21.045,00:15:22.338,Who else do you want to tell? Huh?
00:15:22.421,00:15:24.006,But she's not going to tell anybody.
00:15:24.089,00:15:25.049,"You're wrong, I'm right. I'm smart, you're dumb."
00:15:25.132,00:15:28.218,All this baby drama is making my rosacea act up.
00:15:28.302,00:15:29.261,I know.
00:15:29.345,00:15:32.056,"I just feel bad for them, having to go through this on their own."
00:15:32.139,00:15:33.599,Let me see what I can do.
00:15:33.682,00:15:34.975,I'll report back later.
00:15:35.059,00:15:36.727,"QUINN: No, you're wrong, I'm right."
00:15:36.810,00:15:39.063,"I'm right, okay? She doesn't talk to other moms."
00:15:41.857,00:15:44.944,How do you explain her constant irritation with you?
00:15:47.446,00:15:50.157,"No, I think it's the pregnancy hormones or something."
00:15:50.240,00:15:51.367,They make her kind of nuts.
00:15:51.450,00:15:53.369,It's enough to want to give up women altogether.
00:15:56.288,00:15:58.832,"Anyway, thanks for the advice about singing to the baby like that."
00:15:58.916,00:16:00.960,"Uh, worked like a charm."
00:16:05.297,00:16:06.840,"KURT: Okay, I'll admit it."
00:16:06.924,00:16:08.968,I'm madly in love with Finn.
00:16:09.051,00:16:11.387,I have been since the first time we met.
00:16:15.474,00:16:16.600,Dude.
00:16:16.684,00:16:18.394,Impulse control.
00:16:18.477,00:16:20.396,He was my knight in shining armor.
00:16:20.479,00:16:23.482,My feelings lingered stronger as we bonded over Glee.
00:16:23.565,00:16:24.692,Then football.
00:16:24.775,00:16:25.651,Then skin care.
00:16:25.734,00:16:28.278,Your T zone is dangerously dry.
00:16:29.196,00:16:31.407,Your... your T zone.
00:16:33.492,00:16:35.077,Twice a day.
00:16:35.160,00:16:37.413,It's very mild and has a built-in sunblock.
00:16:37.496,00:16:38.706,Cool.
00:16:38.789,00:16:41.083,"Thanks, man."
00:16:41.166,00:16:43.585,I don't know why I find his stupidity charming.
00:16:43.669,00:16:47.339,"I mean, he's cheating off a girl who thinks the square root of four is rainbows."
00:16:47.423,00:16:48.882,I guess that's love for you.
00:16:48.966,00:16:50.009,WILL: Hey.
00:16:50.092,00:16:51.301,Eyes on your own paper.
00:16:53.929,00:16:59.059,"I know it seems weird that I'm helping Finn with Quinn, but rest assured, it's all part of a master plan."
00:17:04.523,00:17:06.734,And then... he'll be crying into my shoulder pads.
00:17:12.448,00:17:14.450,Okay. So I'm really excited.
00:17:14.533,00:17:19.371,I have picked a medley of songs that's going to be a fantastic teaching tool about how to sing a great ballad.
00:17:19.455,00:17:20.914,Why is Miss Pillsbury here?
00:17:20.998,00:17:22.124,Uh...
00:17:22.207,00:17:23.459,"um, well, I..."
00:17:23.542,00:17:26.170,"I, too, am very curious about the power of the ballad."
00:17:26.253,00:17:29.173,"You know, I'm thinking of doing some career counseling in song."
00:17:29.256,00:17:30.883,"Emma, want to just...? S.A.T. prep..."
00:17:30.966,00:17:32.051,Yeah.
00:17:32.134,00:17:33.302,Yeah. Okay.
00:17:46.815,00:17:49.026,Really listen.
00:17:50.402,00:17:51.320,Okay.
00:19:59.281,00:20:05.829,"So, Rachel, do you think you understood the message I was trying to get across with that ballad?"
00:20:05.913,00:20:09.917,"Yes. It means I'm very young, and it's hard for you to stand close to me."
00:20:11.418,00:20:12.628,"Um, no, um..."
00:20:12.711,00:20:14.630,"Emma, would you mind helping me out here?"
00:20:14.713,00:20:16.548,"Um, was that the message that you got?"
00:20:16.632,00:20:18.884,You're a a very good performer.
00:20:19.927,00:20:21.094,He's very good.
00:20:21.178,00:20:27.643,"RACHEL: Well, I for one can't wait to go home and work on a medley of my own for tomorrow, because this lesson has given me..."
00:20:27.726,00:20:28.727,a lot to think about.
00:20:28.810,00:20:30.646,"No, Rachel, that really wasn't the..."
00:20:30.729,00:20:32.773,You...
00:20:35.025,00:20:37.194,Bravo.
00:20:45.577,00:20:47.371,"Thanks for coming over, Kurt."
00:20:47.454,00:20:49.748,I know you're into fashion and that kind of stuff.
00:20:49.831,00:20:53.585,"And I need to find something nice to wear to the Fabrays' for dinner, so..."
00:20:53.669,00:20:58.674,I couldn't be more pleased and honored to help you find something vintage and appropriate to wear.
00:20:58.757,00:21:01.677,Here it is.
00:21:01.760,00:21:04.930,My mom never had the heart to throw this stuff out.
00:21:08.433,00:21:12.229,"Here, hang on to that for the next time Puck throws you in the Dumpster."
00:21:13.939,00:21:16.525,My dad's the same way.
00:21:16.608,00:21:21.113,"My mom died ten years ago, and he still keeps her toothbrush on the holder by their sink."
00:21:21.196,00:21:26.952,The broken dresser in their room still smells like her perfume.
00:21:28.453,00:21:36.962,"I know it's stupid, but sometimes I'll sneak in there and open all the drawers and lie on the floor and close my eyes and just smell her."
00:21:37.045,00:21:39.006,That's not stupid.
00:21:42.801,00:21:46.972,"I guess in a way, I'm lucky I never knew him, you know?"
00:21:52.978,00:21:55.272,Check this out.
00:21:59.693,00:22:00.986,Not half bad.
00:22:02.821,00:22:04.906,Your father had good taste.
00:22:04.990,00:22:07.617,I can't believe it fits.
00:22:13.290,00:22:14.833,"Uh, thanks."
00:22:22.841,00:22:33.810,"My father was brave enough to fight in some desert thousands of miles away, and I can't even go over to Dudley Road and tell the Fabrays the truth."
00:22:33.894,00:22:36.646,Your father didn't charge into the breach empty-handed.
00:22:36.730,00:22:39.566,He had a weapon.
00:22:39.649,00:22:42.861,You think I should bring a gun?
00:22:42.944,00:22:49.034,"N-No, I think you should use your greatest weapon-- your voice."
00:22:56.041,00:22:58.585,"Hey, sweetie, I'm home."
00:23:03.173,00:23:05.634,Something smells good.
00:23:16.686,00:23:18.647,"Oh, thanks."
00:23:18.730,00:23:20.065,RACHEL: You're welcome.
00:23:20.148,00:23:21.608,Casserole's almost ready.
00:23:21.691,00:23:23.985,Hope you like venison.
00:23:28.907,00:23:30.200,Why did you even let her in the house?
00:23:30.283,00:23:32.202,'Cause she said she was one of your Glee kids.
00:23:32.285,00:23:36.081,It didn't take me five minutes to realize she's in love with you.
00:23:36.164,00:23:38.625,She asked if she could see your baby pictures.
00:23:38.708,00:23:41.128,"What, so now you're making her clean our bathroom?"
00:23:41.211,00:23:43.839,"Look, Will, I have been dealing with these schoolgirl crushes for years."
00:23:43.922,00:23:45.715,So why shouldn't I get a little something out of it?
00:23:45.799,00:23:47.634,Do you have any more Ajax?
00:23:47.717,00:23:50.387,"Oh, in the linen closet, sweetie."
00:23:52.764,00:23:55.851,"This is immoral, Terri."
00:23:55.934,00:23:57.310,"No, honey, you know what's immoral?"
00:23:57.394,00:24:04.067,Is me having to deal with the fact that my husband spends all day with young girls who are perkier and younger than I am.
00:24:04.151,00:24:08.905,I have a rash on my belly from that cocoa butter that your mother sent me.
00:24:08.989,00:24:11.658,Do you have any idea how much it burns when I sweat?
00:24:11.741,00:24:13.660,I can't scrub the floors as hard as she can.
00:24:13.743,00:24:15.704,"Baby, if it's that bad, you have to let me see it."
00:24:15.787,00:24:16.746,It might be infected.
00:24:16.830,00:24:19.875,"What, so now I'm going to show you the bleeding pustules on my skin?"
00:24:19.958,00:24:23.044,"Wow, yeah, no, that's not going to send you into the loving arms of some teenage slut."
00:24:31.595,00:24:34.681,"But why not, huh, if it's win-win for everyone?"
00:24:34.764,00:24:36.141,"Look, she's a really good cook."
00:24:37.142,00:24:38.143,Where are you going?
00:24:38.226,00:24:40.687,I'm taking Rachel home.
00:24:40.770,00:24:43.315,Can you ask her to dust the blinds in the craft room first?
00:24:43.398,00:24:46.193,RACHEL: Mr. Schuester?
00:24:46.276,00:24:47.402,"Yes, Rachel?"
00:24:47.486,00:24:49.696,Why do I have to sit in the backseat?
00:24:49.779,00:24:51.698,"Um, it's the law."
00:24:51.781,00:24:53.867,Children have to ride in the back.
00:24:53.950,00:24:55.869,Children under seven.
00:24:55.952,00:24:58.413,"Well, I'm just concerned for your safety."
00:24:59.456,00:25:01.583,Really?
00:25:01.666,00:25:06.046,"Um... no, not really."
00:25:08.715,00:25:11.885,I think we should take advantage of this golden alone time and practice our ballad.
00:25:11.968,00:25:15.222,"That would be great, but I don't have any music in the car."
00:25:15.305,00:25:17.724,"It's okay, I made us a CD."
00:25:18.892,00:25:20.894,Oh.
00:25:39.829,00:25:42.040,It wasn't finished.
00:25:42.123,00:25:43.917,"Yeah, well, the acoustics are horrible in the car."
00:25:44.000,00:25:45.293,Put your seat belt back on.
00:25:46.253,00:25:49.756,So... how's it going with Puck?
00:25:49.839,00:25:50.757,Are you guys still seeing each other?
00:25:50.840,00:25:51.758,I broke things off.
00:25:51.841,00:25:55.762,"He was too immature, as are all the boys in high school."
00:25:55.845,00:25:59.641,I need a man who can keep up with me intellectually and creatively.
00:25:59.724,00:26:03.562,"Well, that's a tough road for most high school boys."
00:26:05.313,00:26:07.899,That's why I have my sights set much higher.
00:26:17.158,00:26:19.703,Stay away from him.
00:26:19.786,00:26:21.788,You're going to get hurt bad.
00:26:21.871,00:26:22.789,"You can't threaten me, Pepper."
00:26:23.873,00:26:25.709,You should be.
00:26:28.503,00:26:30.797,"Oh, you're on the second floor?"
00:26:30.880,00:26:32.799,"Oh, you're right above me."
00:26:32.882,00:26:34.634,"Girl, you?"
00:26:34.718,00:26:36.428,I am a hot damn mess.
00:26:36.511,00:26:40.807,"I found out today that my hamster is pregnant in biology class, and I just started weeping."
00:26:41.891,00:26:43.810,"No, no, I think that's a great idea."
00:26:43.893,00:26:45.478,We're supposed to be rehearsing.
00:26:45.562,00:26:46.855,I'm talking to Tina.
00:26:49.899,00:26:51.067,"This is bad, dude."
00:26:51.151,00:26:53.820,All our ballads are terrible 'cause we're all so distracted.
00:26:53.903,00:26:55.905,We're all worried about Finn and Quinn and Babygate.
00:26:55.989,00:26:58.825,We can't even sing about our emotions 'cause we're so worried about theirs.
00:26:58.908,00:27:00.243,Who cares?
00:27:06.750,00:27:07.834,Are you kidding me?
00:27:11.087,00:27:12.213,Finn gets everything.
00:27:12.297,00:27:14.215,"He gets the sympathy, he gets the girl."
00:27:14.299,00:27:15.842,What is your problem?
00:27:15.925,00:27:16.843,Finn's not the father.
00:27:17.969,00:27:19.220,I am.
00:27:20.305,00:27:22.849,What?
00:27:27.562,00:27:29.481,"All right, look."
00:27:29.564,00:27:32.150,You need to get something through your Mohawk real quick.
00:27:32.233,00:27:33.276,You're the baby's daddy.
00:27:33.360,00:27:36.863,"It takes a hell of a lot more to be a father, and that role's already been cast."
00:27:36.946,00:27:46.665,"because Quinn chose Finn, and you need to accept that and move on 'cause you have no business messing up that girl's life any more than you already have."
00:27:46.748,00:27:48.875,You need to back off.
00:27:48.958,00:27:50.919,You owe her at least that much.
00:27:59.678,00:28:02.889,"Mmm, it's a lovely ham."
00:28:02.972,00:28:03.973,Thank you.
00:28:04.057,00:28:05.892,There is no beating Judy's ham.
00:28:06.976,00:28:08.269,"Well, I cure all my own meats."
00:28:12.982,00:28:15.735,I'd like to propose a toast.
00:28:15.819,00:28:16.903,QUINN: Daddy.
00:28:16.986,00:28:25.412,No. Russell The Fabrays are a tight-knit family.
00:28:25.495,00:28:31.501,"I have been blessed with a loving wife, two remarkable daughters."
00:28:31.584,00:28:36.923,My first married a wonderful Christian man who owns his own chain of UPS stores.
00:28:37.006,00:28:41.928,My second daughter-- little Quinnie-- we are just so proud of her.
00:28:42.011,00:28:44.431,Captain of the Cheerios.
00:28:44.514,00:28:45.932,President of the Celibacy Club.
00:28:49.227,00:28:51.771,I'm certain she's a shoo-in for princess of the...
00:28:51.855,00:28:52.939,She is.
00:28:54.023,00:28:57.777,"we are very glad to welcome her new friend-- quarterback, no less."
00:28:57.861,00:28:59.821,I have to go to the bathroom.
00:29:01.239,00:29:04.117,Uh... too much pop.
00:29:06.035,00:29:09.038,"Oh, wait, it's right through the kitchen, sweetheart."
00:29:10.665,00:29:12.959,"He wears a helmet when he plays, right?"
00:29:13.042,00:29:15.044,"He's just intimidated by you, Daddy."
00:29:24.053,00:29:25.388,"Well, hello, Finn Hudson."
00:29:25.472,00:29:27.599,I'm at the Fabrays and I'm freaking out.
00:29:27.682,00:29:28.975,What does a heart attack feel like?
00:29:29.058,00:29:31.978,"Settle down, cowboy. This is why we burned the disc and spent all that time rehearsing."
00:29:32.061,00:29:33.563,"I can't do it. Yes, you can."
00:29:33.646,00:29:34.981,Just remember the power of the ballad.
00:29:35.064,00:29:36.983,I have to go; they'll think I'm pooping.
00:29:47.243,00:29:48.578,Ha!
00:29:51.956,00:29:53.291,That's my kitchen radio.
00:29:53.374,00:29:55.001,"Yeah, I need to borrow it."
00:29:55.084,00:29:57.295,"Finn, what's this?"
00:29:57.378,00:30:00.840,"Well, we have this assignment in Glee Club to sing a ballad."
00:30:00.924,00:30:04.844,They're all about expressing the things you can't find any other way to say.
00:30:04.928,00:30:06.012,"Oh, God, Finn, don't."
00:30:06.095,00:30:08.181,Please don't.
00:30:08.264,00:30:11.142,"No, I need to do this for both of us."
00:31:39.397,00:31:41.107,There must be some sort of mistake here.
00:31:44.027,00:31:46.112,You... you did.
00:31:46.195,00:31:47.405,We didn't even have sex.
00:31:47.488,00:31:50.283,"I'm sorry. Can we just stop with the lying, please?"
00:31:50.366,00:31:56.831,"But I... When you were about five years old, I took you and your sister down to an Indians game."
00:32:02.086,00:32:04.130,Daddy.
00:32:04.213,00:32:09.928,"Your sister made it through the whole game, but you fell asleep in my lap."
00:32:10.011,00:32:19.896,"I kept hoping nothing exciting would happen, 'cause I didn't want the crowd to get too loud-- ...wake you up."
00:32:23.858,00:32:26.069,Didn't matter.
00:32:28.237,00:32:34.160,You stayed asleep in my arms till the game ended.
00:32:35.119,00:32:37.455,"Daddy, I'm so sorry."
00:32:44.253,00:32:45.213,Wait.
00:32:45.296,00:32:47.757,"Please, Daddy can we talk about this?"
00:32:51.094,00:32:52.804,He loves me.
00:32:52.887,00:32:53.930,"You, too."
00:32:56.140,00:32:58.184,Get out of my house.
00:33:01.562,00:33:03.231,"Please, Mrs. Fabray, do something."
00:33:03.314,00:33:04.482,"Don't bother, Finn."
00:33:06.567,00:33:11.197,"If she wanted to do something, she would've when she found out that I was pregnant."
00:33:12.073,00:33:13.282,You knew?
00:33:14.325,00:33:15.910,I-- no.
00:33:15.994,00:33:17.495,She didn't tell me anything.
00:33:17.578,00:33:18.496,But you knew.
00:33:19.288,00:33:21.791,And I needed you.
00:33:24.210,00:33:35.513,And you were so scared of what he would do if he found out you just pushed it aside like we do every bad feeling in this house.
00:33:35.596,00:33:38.391,"If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist."
00:33:38.474,00:33:40.435,Now do not turn this on us!
00:33:40.518,00:33:43.062,You are the disappointment here!
00:33:43.146,00:33:45.231,Why?
00:33:47.316,00:33:50.361,Because I'm not a little girl anymore?
00:33:51.529,00:33:53.406,Because I made a mistake?
00:33:53.489,00:33:55.825,Who are you?
00:33:57.326,00:33:59.245,I don't recognize you at all.
00:33:59.328,00:34:01.581,I'm your daughter.
00:34:03.041,00:34:04.667,Who loves you.
00:34:04.751,00:34:12.717,"And who knows this must be really hard for you, but I just need my daddy to hold me, and tell me that it's going to be okay."
00:34:23.394,00:34:25.271,Please.
00:34:40.661,00:34:45.333,"Honey, how many times have I told you, you gotta turn these T-shirts right side out before you..."
00:34:45.416,00:34:47.460,Um...
00:34:47.543,00:34:50.171,"Mom, Quinn's parents threw her out."
00:34:51.380,00:34:54.092,Could she stay here for a couple of days?
00:34:56.052,00:34:58.554,"Yeah, of course she can."
00:35:00.598,00:35:03.017,"Honey, you can stay here as long as you want."
00:35:11.234,00:35:12.568,"I have nothing to say to you, Pepper."
00:35:12.652,00:35:14.737,"If you continue to stalk me, I'll press charges."
00:35:14.821,00:35:15.822,Everyone knows what you are.
00:35:15.905,00:35:17.240,You're the school crazy.
00:35:17.323,00:35:18.324,I was crazy.
00:35:18.407,00:35:20.993,Crazy in love.
00:35:21.077,00:35:23.913,There's nothing you can say that's going to change the way I feel about Mr. Schuester.
00:35:23.996,00:35:25.331,Ours is a love for the ages.
00:35:25.414,00:35:27.333,Your threats will just make our love grow stronger.
00:35:27.416,00:35:32.839,Let me tell you a few things I learned from two years of intense psychotherapy and an esophagus transplant.
00:35:32.922,00:35:36.509,Lesson number one: You and Shue? It won't work.
00:35:36.592,00:35:37.844,What do you mean?
00:35:37.927,00:35:41.389,"We're not so different, you and me."
00:35:41.472,00:35:44.600,We're both mildly attractive and extremely grating.
00:35:44.684,00:35:47.061,Love is hard for us.
00:35:47.145,00:35:48.855,We look for boys we know we can never have.
00:35:48.938,00:35:58.865,"Mr. Shue is a perfect target for our self-esteem issues: He can never reciprocate our feelings, which only reinforces the conviction that we're not worthy of being loved."
00:35:58.948,00:35:59.991,Trust me.
00:36:00.074,00:36:02.743,I'm a cautionary tale.
00:36:04.453,00:36:07.999,"You need to find some self-respect, Rachel."
00:36:08.082,00:36:11.169,Get that mildly attractive groove back.
00:36:28.519,00:36:31.439,The ballad I've selected has an important message that I'm anxious for you to hear.
00:36:31.522,00:36:33.774,"Rachel, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to stop you."
00:36:35.484,00:36:37.987,The way you've been acting is totally inappropriate.
00:36:39.280,00:36:42.408,"I'm your teacher, Rachel, and I'm sorry, but that's all I'm ever going to be."
00:36:43.492,00:36:45.286,I know.
00:36:46.495,00:36:48.414,I...
00:36:48.497,00:36:51.542,brought these for you as an apology.
00:36:53.169,00:37:01.010,"And the song I was going to sing was, Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word by Elton John, 'cause I know how much you love it."
00:37:01.093,00:37:03.179,I'm such an idiot.
00:37:05.014,00:37:06.933,Mooning over you and cleaning your apartment...
00:37:07.016,00:37:08.935,Hey.
00:37:09.018,00:37:10.478,It's okay.
00:37:17.735,00:37:20.863,"I know it's not always easy for you, Rachel."
00:37:20.947,00:37:25.451,And I know that there are some things about yourself that you think you'd like to change.
00:37:28.537,00:37:31.249,who's going to like you for everything you are.
00:37:31.332,00:37:33.459,Including those parts of you that even you don't like.
00:37:33.542,00:37:36.462,Those are going to be the things he likes the most.
00:37:39.548,00:37:42.468,"Thanks, Mr. Shue."
00:37:44.971,00:37:46.472,What do you say we ditch rehearsal today?
00:37:48.849,00:37:53.312,"I've got to be honest, Rachel, you've never really needed much help with your ballads."
00:37:53.396,00:37:56.190,You've been knocking them out of the park since day one.
00:37:59.402,00:38:01.153,Do you like them?
00:38:01.237,00:38:03.155,They're great.
00:38:05.992,00:38:09.161,So they just kicked her out?
00:38:09.245,00:38:10.997,Yeah.
00:38:11.080,00:38:12.957,Gave her half an hour to pack.
00:38:13.040,00:38:15.418,Father set the timer on the microwave.
00:38:15.501,00:38:17.503,I'm sorry.
00:38:17.586,00:38:19.755,I guess my plan kind of sucked.
00:38:19.839,00:38:22.967,"No, uh, this is good."
00:38:23.050,00:38:24.927,No more secrets.
00:38:25.011,00:38:27.930,"You know, everything's out there-- all the feelings."
00:38:28.014,00:38:31.017,"And that's better, right?"
00:38:32.601,00:38:35.521,Yes. Better.
00:38:35.604,00:38:39.734,Good.
00:38:39.817,00:38:42.528,"All right, well, uh, let's work on your ballad."
00:38:42.611,00:38:45.406,You were really helpful when I was trying to find mine.
00:38:45.489,00:38:46.824,So what is it?
00:38:47.783,00:38:51.120,I Honestly Love You.
00:38:52.705,00:38:54.540,Sounds awesome.
00:38:56.417,00:39:03.549,"I don't know the song, or whatever, but it sounds positive and nice and stuff."
00:39:03.632,00:39:06.218,"MERCEDES: Hey, you two."
00:39:06.302,00:39:08.054,We need to go to the choir room.
00:39:08.137,00:39:09.597,Why?
00:39:09.680,00:39:12.892,Because there's something we want to give you and Quinn.
00:39:17.063,00:39:17.980,Is there a cake?
00:39:18.064,00:39:19.565,"No, there's no cake."
00:39:19.648,00:39:21.567,QUINN: Oh. MERCEDES: Be quiet and sit down.
00:39:21.650,00:39:22.985,"Hi, Quinn."
00:39:23.069,00:39:26.614,Do you know what's going on?
00:39:26.697,00:39:31.952,Your fellow Glee Club members want to sing a song for you guys to let you know how they feel about you.
00:39:32.036,00:39:34.205,What are you going to sing?
00:39:34.288,00:39:35.623,Just listen.
00:39:35.706,00:39:37.375,The song says everything.
00:00:01.418,00:00:05.673,"So, here's what you missed last week: Quinn's parents found out she's pregnant because Finn told them in song."
00:00:05.714,00:00:06.757,We didn't even have sex.
00:00:11.094,00:00:16.767,"I don't care if that baby comes out with a mohawk, I will go to my grave swearing it's Finn's."
00:00:16.809,00:00:18.811,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:26.109,00:00:28.069,"Hey, fella."
00:00:28.111,00:00:39.748,"So unless my recent write-up here in Splits magazine naming me cheerleading coach of the decade has me driven completely insane, I'm pretty sure you and I had an agreement that you were going to show me your Glee Club set list for Sectionals."
00:00:44.127,00:00:46.839,"Well, I'm the fine arts administrator or something."
00:00:51.134,00:00:52.594,That'd be fantastic.
00:00:52.636,00:00:54.221,I'd hate to have to go to Figgins about this.
00:00:55.639,00:00:57.224,"Hey, Will."
00:00:58.976,00:01:00.561,"I'd like my magazine back, please."
00:01:04.982,00:01:06.942,Thank you.
00:01:12.155,00:01:13.532,I knew she was up to something.
00:01:13.574,00:01:15.158,"Five, six, seven, eight."
00:01:23.166,00:01:25.044,Brittany?
00:01:30.674,00:01:32.384,It kept getting worse.
00:01:32.426,00:01:34.053,"Hey there, pal."
00:01:32.426,00:01:36.555,Would you remind me once again the names of the schools you'll be competing against at Sectionals?
00:01:39.182,00:01:40.350,Got it. What are their zip codes?
00:01:42.185,00:01:45.397,She's leaking our competitive set list to the other schools.
00:01:45.439,00:01:50.151,"If the other glee clubs get set lists and videos, they'll know exactly how to beat us at Sectionals."
00:01:50.193,00:01:52.821,"Well first, don't let Sue distract you, all right?"
00:01:52.863,00:01:59.160,"And if you can't take Mohammad to the mountain, then you got to get Mohammad to bring the mountain down to his house."
00:01:59.202,00:02:01.789,"Mohammad's house, wherever he's staying."
00:02:01.830,00:02:03.874,I don't understand.
00:02:01.830,00:02:07.836,"Look, you should drive over to Jane Addams Academy and ask the director point-blank."
00:02:07.878,00:02:09.212,"If something's going on, you'll know."
00:02:10.881,00:02:13.008,Hmm.
00:02:18.680,00:02:29.149,"Captioned by access.wgbh.org oup at WGBH All right. Oh, thanks."
00:02:45.248,00:02:47.001,"You're a good kid, Aphasia."
00:02:47.042,00:02:48.251,Why did you try to rob a bank?
00:02:48.293,00:02:51.672,"Because, Ms. Hitchens, that's where they keep the money."
00:02:51.713,00:02:53.799,Go back to class.
00:02:53.841,00:02:55.216,"Uh, hi, Ms. Hitchens."
00:02:55.258,00:02:58.012,I'm Will Schuester from McKinley High.
00:02:58.053,00:03:01.140,Aphasia! Give Mr. Schuester his wallet back.
00:03:09.272,00:03:10.691,Um...
00:03:10.732,00:03:12.233,Thank you.
00:03:12.275,00:03:14.820,We don't get a lot of other educators paying us visits.
00:03:14.862,00:03:16.738,Right. Um...
00:03:16.780,00:03:20.241,"Well, the reason I'm here is... a little weird."
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.202,So I guess the best thing for me to do is just come right out with it.
00:03:25.080,00:03:31.128,I think our cheerleading coach has been passing along our set list for Sectionals to you.
00:03:34.297,00:03:36.175,"No, no, no, no, I..."
00:03:36.216,00:03:37.926,"It's not that you, it's, it's Sue."
00:03:37.968,00:03:39.720,Do you know that we don't have costumes?
00:03:39.761,00:03:42.305,Or even an auditorium.
00:03:42.347,00:03:44.183,Our show choir has to practice out in the rec yard.
00:03:44.224,00:03:46.185,This is Ohio.
00:03:46.226,00:03:48.311,You don't have to tell me about underfunding for the arts.
00:03:56.319,00:04:00.448,I'm not going to cheat we can get a leg upso on your school of privileged misfits.
00:04:03.326,00:04:04.494,We're probably going to take you anyway.
00:04:04.536,00:04:06.955,Really? And who'd you hear that from?
00:04:06.997,00:04:08.373,I had my spies at your invitational.
00:04:10.042,00:04:11.168,Want some coffee?
00:04:11.210,00:04:13.003,Please.
00:04:13.754,00:04:16.131,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
00:04:16.173,00:04:19.218,I didn't mean to offend you.
00:04:19.259,00:04:21.302,Let me make it up to you.
00:04:21.344,00:04:24.305,"You guys don't have an auditorium, come use ours."
00:04:24.347,00:04:26.266,"Yeah, let's have a little, uh, scrimmage at our place."
00:04:28.185,00:04:33.565,"WILL: Okay, guys, so first of all I want to welcome Ms. Hitchens and the Jane Addams Glee Club."
00:04:33.607,00:04:35.358,We're all very happy to have you guys here.
00:04:35.400,00:04:37.945,"So, um, we're going to let you guys start us off."
00:06:57.709,00:07:00.379,"Mr. Shue, you seem concerned."
00:07:00.419,00:07:01.504,What? No.
00:07:01.546,00:07:04.174,"I mean, they were great, but we're just as good."
00:07:08.011,00:07:09.470,It's called hairography.
00:07:11.514,00:07:16.144,All the whizzing of their hair around just to distract from not really good dancers.
00:07:16.186,00:07:18.355,And their vocals were just so-so.
00:07:18.397,00:07:19.773,Trust me.
00:07:19.814,00:07:21.691,We've nothing to be afraid of.
00:07:29.324,00:07:30.491,"All right, guys."
00:07:30.533,00:07:32.327,I did some thinking last night.
00:07:32.369,00:07:35.289,I think I found our new number for Sectionals.
00:07:35.330,00:07:38.333,We're going to do the title song from Hair.
00:07:38.375,00:07:40.210,"Now, this show started a revolution."
00:07:40.252,00:07:41.878,"Wait, did they have mohawks back then?"
00:07:41.920,00:07:43.171,Like in the 20's or whatever?
00:07:43.213,00:07:47.092,"Yeah, Mr. Shue, if we're going to do a song about hair, shouldn't we have more hair?"
00:07:47.134,00:07:48.343,One step ahead of you.
00:07:48.385,00:07:50.804,Here are your wigs.
00:07:51.846,00:07:53.223,Mr. Schuester?
00:07:53.265,00:07:54.766,What are you doing?
00:07:54.808,00:07:56.393,We are fine where we are.
00:07:56.435,00:07:57.518,We don't need hairography.
00:07:58.561,00:07:59.938,"Look, I have to be honest."
00:07:59.980,00:08:02.357,Those Jane Addams girls did freak me out a little.
00:08:02.399,00:08:05.152,And I'm worried about our chances for Sectionals.
00:08:05.193,00:08:07.988,"I mean, we have to pull out all the stops if we want to win."
00:08:11.241,00:08:13.368,"Looking great, guys!"
00:08:16.579,00:08:18.165,Figured I'd steal it for you.
00:08:18.206,00:08:21.542,"You know, in case you change your mind and decide you want to keep it."
00:08:21.584,00:08:23.503,That is so sweet.
00:08:24.629,00:08:29.259,"To be honest, I really don't know what I'm going to do about it anymore."
00:08:29.301,00:08:31.345,My mind's pretty messed up about everything.
00:08:31.386,00:08:32.512,"Well, whatever you decide."
00:08:33.596,00:08:35.223,No pressure.
00:08:35.265,00:08:36.933,Okay.
00:08:36.975,00:08:38.226,QUINN: Thank God for Puck.
00:08:38.268,00:08:45.066,"Thanks to him, I'm starting to realize that what I need right now, even more than looser pants, is acceptance."
00:08:45.108,00:08:48.736,Everyone is putting so much pressure on me.
00:08:48.778,00:08:51.072,It's so easy for them to be distracted.
00:08:51.114,00:08:53.283,I don't have that luxury.
00:08:53.325,00:08:54.575,I am under siege.
00:08:54.617,00:08:56.203,"You don't drink diet soda, do you?"
00:08:58.497,00:08:59.580,The baby's a girl.
00:08:59.622,00:09:01.458,"Women go bald, too."
00:09:01.500,00:09:02.625,"You worry too much, Terri."
00:09:02.667,00:09:08.423,Mom smoked and drank a bottle of Riuniti on Ice every night when she was pregnant with us and we're totally normal.
00:09:08.465,00:09:14.221,"Just take your vitamins, stay out of the hot tub, and avoid rum-based drinks, and you'll be fine."
00:09:14.262,00:09:18.392,Maybe the problem isn't that I don't want to keep the baby.
00:09:18.433,00:09:21.561,The problem is that I don't want to keep the baby with Finn.
00:09:23.230,00:09:25.106,Maybe I didn't give Puck enough of a chance.
00:09:25.148,00:09:27.984,"He is the real dad, after all."
00:09:28.026,00:09:31.238,Finn would freak if I started spending time with Puck though.
00:09:35.700,00:09:37.077,But how?
00:09:38.328,00:09:39.329,"Mm, forget about it."
00:09:39.371,00:09:42.123,She looks like a five year old.
00:09:46.545,00:09:49.047,"Hey, Kurt, can I pick your pink brain for a second?"
00:09:49.089,00:09:50.257,"Why hello, Quinn."
00:09:50.298,00:09:51.632,To what do I owe the honor?
00:09:51.674,00:09:54.511,I do believe this is the first time you've ever spoken to me.
00:09:54.553,00:09:56.096,I'm sorry about that.
00:10:00.141,00:10:01.726,Makeovers are like crack to me.
00:10:01.768,00:10:03.644,My suggestion... SPANX.
00:10:03.686,00:10:07.065,Or a double-knit camisole with a control top for the baby bump.
00:10:07.107,00:10:10.235,"Also, babydoll dresses-- dead giveaway."
00:10:10.277,00:10:12.487,"Not for me, for Rachel."
00:10:12.529,00:10:14.030,Why would I want to do that?
00:10:14.072,00:10:22.330,"I admit I like a challenge as much as the next guy, but Rachel somehow manages to dress like a grandmother and a toddler at the same time."
00:10:22.372,00:10:24.165,My point exactly.
00:10:24.207,00:10:28.169,"You're as concerned about the Glee Club succeeding as I am, and she's a distraction."
00:10:38.721,00:10:41.308,And to think... I thought you were a dumb blonde.
00:10:42.309,00:10:43.560,Deal.
00:10:53.403,00:10:54.904,Good night.
00:11:09.336,00:11:11.212,What are you doing?!
00:11:09.336,00:11:12.964,I'm trying to be intimate with my wife.
00:11:15.216,00:11:18.136,"If you wanted intimacy, you..."
00:11:18.178,00:11:20.721,you would ask me how I'm feeling about being pregnant.
00:11:20.763,00:11:21.764,You're right.
00:11:21.806,00:11:24.643,I'm sorry.
00:11:24.683,00:11:25.684,Okay.
00:11:34.777,00:11:38.573,Yeah. Of course.
00:11:38.615,00:11:40.741,Love you.
00:11:45.872,00:11:48.625,TERRI: There's no way I can keep this up.
00:11:50.709,00:11:54.631,"I miss him, too, though."
00:11:54.673,00:11:56.757,I do want to have a family with him.
00:11:56.799,00:12:00.679,I only ever started lying about all of this to give us a chance.
00:12:00.719,00:12:04.224,I just need to buy myself some more time.
00:12:04.265,00:12:06.767,I've got to distract him with something.
00:12:06.809,00:12:08.727,But what?
00:12:17.445,00:12:20.365,The key is to never wax above the eyebrow.
00:12:20.407,00:12:21.491,Always shape from below.
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.453,Look at mine.
00:12:25.495,00:12:31.292,"Kurt, why did you volunteer to give me a new look?"
00:12:31.334,00:12:36.506,"One, I'm a sucker for makeovers, and two, you need something to distract from your horrible personality."
00:12:36.548,00:12:39.800,"Most of the time, I find it hard to be in the same room with you."
00:12:39.842,00:12:41.636,Especially this one.
00:12:41.678,00:12:45.432,Which looks like where Strawberry Shortcake and Holly Hobbie come to hook up.
00:12:48.767,00:12:51.479,"You're extremely talented, Rachel."
00:12:51.521,00:12:54.482,Watching you perform is... amazing.
00:12:54.524,00:13:00.614,But sometimes it's hard to appreciate what a good singer you are because all I'm thinking about is shoving a sock into your mouth.
00:13:04.284,00:13:07.828,We need to broaden your appeal.
00:13:10.873,00:13:14.294,There's really only just...
00:13:16.921,00:13:18.757,Can you keep a secret?
00:13:18.797,00:13:19.716,Of course.
00:13:19.758,00:13:22.510,I'm in love with Finn.
00:13:22.552,00:13:23.802,Really?
00:13:25.680,00:13:27.641,I understand completely.
00:13:27.682,00:13:29.434,Let's move on to makeup.
00:13:29.476,00:13:32.853,I happen to know for a fact that Finn is attracted to loose women.
00:13:32.895,00:13:36.357,What? Quinn is so wholesome.
00:13:36.399,00:13:39.527,Let me put this into musical theater parlance.
00:13:39.569,00:13:41.738,"In Grease, what did Sandy do to get Danny Zuko?"
00:13:41.780,00:13:45.116,She had to ditch the poodle skirt and slap on a cat suit.
00:13:45.158,00:13:47.910,"In short, she had to dress like a ho."
00:13:47.952,00:13:56.544,"Maybe if your look was better, more desirable, Finn would be in your arms right now."
00:13:56.586,00:13:58.797,Instead of Quinn's.
00:14:02.592,00:14:03.968,"What's going on, Terr?"
00:14:04.010,00:14:05.886,"Just a couple more steps, okay?"
00:14:05.928,00:14:07.930,"All right, stop."
00:14:12.851,00:14:14.688,WILL: Is that the Blue Bomber?
00:14:14.729,00:14:16.939,It is!
00:14:16.981,00:14:19.192,I remember I took you to prom in this car.
00:14:19.233,00:14:20.819,We did it in the backseat.
00:14:20.860,00:14:22.570,"Well, this isn't actually your old car."
00:14:22.612,00:14:24.197,I found this one on eBay.
00:14:24.238,00:14:26.700,"You know, I always regretted selling this car."
00:14:26.741,00:14:28.909,I know. That's why I got you this one.
00:14:28.951,00:14:33.832,I thought maybe working on it would be a-- a distraction from all the pressure that you've been under.
00:14:33.873,00:14:35.750,You are the best.
00:14:39.253,00:14:41.922,Honey.
00:14:45.802,00:14:47.011,"Oh, maybe I'll stop by Pep Boys."
00:14:47.053,00:14:49.430,Maybe they have some advice.
00:14:49.472,00:14:50.515,That's a good idea.
00:14:50.557,00:14:52.225,Yeah.
00:14:52.266,00:14:53.934,How could you bring her here?
00:14:53.976,00:14:54.935,What if he saw her?
00:14:54.977,00:14:56.437,You're gonna want to hear this.
00:14:56.479,00:15:00.941,"I gave little Miss Peroxide my phone number in case of an emergency, and she called to drop the bomb on me."
00:15:00.983,00:15:02.694,What? What bomb?
00:15:03.778,00:15:07.323,What is it?
00:15:07.365,00:15:09.242,I'm keeping my baby.
00:15:25.007,00:15:27.761,And you think we don't have the same problem?
00:15:27.802,00:15:30.471,I run the glee club at a school for the deaf.
00:15:33.015,00:15:42.650,"Now sure, my kids may be deaf, but that shouldn't distract everyone from the fact that they still have a song in their heart, and they should have the same chance as everyone else to express it."
00:15:42.692,00:15:45.820,"Now I had scarlet fever as a kid, leaving me deaf in one ear."
00:15:45.862,00:15:49.490,"So I remember what it's like to have full hearing, but my poor kids don't know the difference."
00:15:53.035,00:15:57.498,And then they have to hear that McKinley went and invited those bad girls to the school.
00:15:57.540,00:15:59.834,That's just not fair.
00:15:59.876,00:16:01.377,I think your phone's ringing.
00:16:03.045,00:16:09.803,All I am saying is that it would be nice if you went and hosted another scrimmage and had the courtesy to invite us this time.
00:16:09.844,00:16:11.053,I couldn't agree more.
00:16:12.054,00:16:13.807,I said I agree with you.
00:16:13.848,00:16:15.475,"Okay, I can't hear you."
00:16:15.516,00:16:17.518,Talk into this ear.
00:16:17.560,00:16:19.604,I'm sorry...
00:16:19.646,00:16:20.521,"Um, how's Monday?"
00:16:20.563,00:16:22.231,"No, it has to be Monday."
00:16:22.273,00:16:23.858,Yes! All right!
00:16:23.900,00:16:25.067,Monday!
00:16:28.780,00:16:31.491,You don't have to make fun of me with those hand gestures.
00:16:31.532,00:16:32.909,"No, I didn't..."
00:16:32.951,00:16:34.494,I didn't mean to.
00:16:34.535,00:16:36.746,Let me check with my secretary.
00:16:36.788,00:16:38.080,"Oh, damn, four missed calls."
00:16:38.122,00:16:40.708,What's that?
00:16:40.750,00:16:42.209,I didn't say anything.
00:16:42.251,00:16:46.297,"Yes, thank you."
00:16:46.339,00:16:47.882,Hello.
00:16:47.924,00:16:49.175,Hello?!
00:16:52.386,00:16:53.763,I can't do this anymore.
00:16:53.805,00:16:55.055,It's time to tell him.
00:16:55.097,00:16:56.850,WILL: Terri?
00:16:56.891,00:16:58.309,"Oh, hey, Kendra."
00:17:00.144,00:17:02.897,You make one sexy grease monkey.
00:17:02.939,00:17:04.899,I am having so much fun.
00:17:04.941,00:17:07.568,"Working with my hands, searching for parts all over town."
00:17:07.610,00:17:11.322,I feel like I'm in a Springsteen song.
00:17:11.364,00:17:15.326,"Well, I got to get some old dish towels-- mop up the grime."
00:17:18.913,00:17:21.708,That car is the perfect distraction.
00:17:21.749,00:17:25.294,I would get something like that for Phil if I didn't think it would make him so happy.
00:17:26.379,00:17:30.090,He's going to get pretty damn suspicious when I come home from the hospital without a baby.
00:17:30.132,00:17:31.759,You need to relax.
00:17:32.927,00:17:34.470,And drink more.
00:17:34.512,00:17:37.348,I have got this whole thing figured out.
00:17:37.390,00:17:39.266,You do?
00:17:42.144,00:17:49.360,You and I are going to have a lady's week at a spa down in Cincci that caters to the prenatal set.
00:17:49.402,00:17:55.700,"But, in reality, we're gonna be camped out at Wu's office with Quinn until that high school hussy drops."
00:17:55.742,00:17:58.828,That's a great plan.
00:17:58.870,00:18:01.956,Except for the fact that Quinn won't give us her baby anymore.
00:18:01.998,00:18:05.167,"But she will, dummy."
00:18:08.170,00:18:10.381,How are we going to do that?
00:18:10.423,00:18:12.216,She needs money.
00:18:12.258,00:18:15.302,I'm going to have her babysit my kids.
00:18:15.344,00:18:18.639,Five minutes alone with those little mongrels and she'll have her tubes tied.
00:18:18.681,00:18:21.308,You're so smart.
00:18:21.350,00:18:24.395,"You got the beauty, but I got the brains and the beauty."
00:18:33.487,00:18:36.074,"Hey, Rachel."
00:18:36.115,00:18:38.034,"Oh, hey, Finn."
00:18:38.076,00:18:39.368,I didn't see you there.
00:18:39.410,00:18:41.203,Did you want to ask me something?
00:18:43.414,00:18:45.833,"Uh, yeah, I-I just, I forgot."
00:18:45.875,00:18:47.334,I got distracted.
00:18:47.376,00:18:48.753,"Well, I'm glad I got your attention."
00:18:48.795,00:18:51.464,I wanted to know if you wanted to come over on Friday night.
00:18:51.505,00:18:57.845,"As someone who's had long, luxurious locks since I was a toddler in the pageant circuit, I figured I could give you some tips on our Hair number."
00:18:57.887,00:19:00.098,"Yeah, that'd be great."
00:19:02.391,00:19:05.686,8:00 is terrific.
00:19:08.689,00:19:10.650,Objective achieved.
00:19:10.691,00:19:12.234,Commence phase two.
00:19:13.235,00:19:14.445,"Hey, Quinn."
00:19:16.489,00:19:21.285,"I, uh, wanted to ask your permission to maybe do something on Friday night, if..."
00:19:21.327,00:19:22.495,"Oh, that's fine."
00:19:22.536,00:19:25.289,I'm babysitting anyways.
00:19:25.331,00:19:26.874,"Oh, cool."
00:19:26.916,00:19:28.167,I'll see ya.
00:19:31.420,00:19:34.924,"Hey, what are you doing on Friday?"
00:19:34.966,00:19:36.425,Just the usual.
00:19:47.311,00:19:52.232,"Some of you, particularly the guys, have come up to me with some questions about Hairography."
00:19:52.274,00:19:54.443,One of our own has volunteered to walk us through it.
00:19:54.485,00:19:55.736,She has got it down.
00:19:55.778,00:19:58.031,"Brittany, take it away."
00:19:58.072,00:20:00.324,Take what away?
00:20:00.366,00:20:02.242,Show us what you got.
00:20:02.284,00:20:04.162,Oh.
00:20:04.203,00:20:05.830,"So, Hairography."
00:20:05.872,00:20:07.915,It works best when you pretend like you're getting tasered.
00:20:07.957,00:20:12.586,So you just move your head around like you're spazzing and stuff.
00:20:17.091,00:20:18.342,Very nice.
00:20:21.387,00:20:23.263,"You guys, it's like cool epilepsy."
00:20:25.307,00:20:27.267,Let's see what you got.
00:20:27.309,00:20:28.435,"Good, guys, yeah."
00:20:28.477,00:20:31.022,"Just relax and go for it, all right."
00:20:36.360,00:20:39.530,"My neck, my back."
00:20:43.325,00:20:44.702,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:20:47.329,00:20:48.873,You'll do anything to torpedo Glee Club.
00:20:48.915,00:20:50.332,And it has got to stop!
00:20:52.334,00:20:55.295,And one I understand you've been making to our friends at Haverbrook and Jane Addams.
00:20:55.337,00:20:59.299,And it's an outrageous affront to my sterling reputation!
00:20:59.341,00:21:02.762,"That being said, fine, I have been checking up on you."
00:21:02.803,00:21:04.972,Because I don't like what's going on in there.
00:21:05.014,00:21:09.685,Do you know why I make each of my Cheerios wear her hair pulled back in a ponytail?
00:21:09.727,00:21:12.146,Because I don't want to distract from her impeccable talent.
00:21:12.188,00:21:15.399,"You seem to be taking the opposite approach, Will."
00:21:15.441,00:21:19.319,And that leads me to believe you know your kids don't have what it takes.
00:21:19.361,00:21:20.988,I believe in my kids.
00:21:21.030,00:21:22.949,"Well, maybe in the beginning, but not now."
00:21:22.990,00:21:28.204,Now that you've seen the competition that threatens your very position at this school!
00:21:28.246,00:21:31.207,You're going to get me an updated set list by 5:00 tomorrow.
00:21:31.249,00:21:36.336,"And if there's anything on that list that involved, demeaning, fruity hair tossing, I'm cutting it!"
00:21:36.378,00:21:40.340,I will not let you dictate my number choices.
00:21:40.382,00:21:42.969,And you are not getting that list.
00:21:43.010,00:21:44.470,"Well, then I'm back as co-director."
00:21:51.393,00:21:53.437,"Okay, guys, from the top."
00:21:55.439,00:21:57.399,I'll just be a second.
00:21:59.860,00:22:03.030,"Yeah, I mean, you know, it's all about getting warmed up."
00:22:03.072,00:22:05.616,"Could you think of a song, maybe, that we could practice with?"
00:22:05.658,00:22:07.868,"What about the, the one from Grease?"
00:22:17.586,00:22:19.922,Tell me about it... stud.
00:22:49.285,00:22:50.828,"Wait, stop, stop."
00:22:52.496,00:22:53.664,What's wrong?
00:22:53.706,00:22:55.291,I need to be honest with you.
00:22:55.333,00:22:57.293,I'm-I'm really uncomfortable right now.
00:22:57.335,00:23:02.965,"I'm gonna say this as nicely as I possibly can, but you look like a sad clown hooker."
00:23:05.467,00:23:06.344,What?
00:23:06.384,00:23:09.596,"This look, it just isn't you."
00:23:09.638,00:23:17.479,"I mean, maybe when I first saw it, I was caught off guard that you looked all adult and stuff, but it's not what's really great about you, Rachel."
00:23:17.521,00:23:22.693,"I actually like the way you usually dress, sequined leg warmers and stuff."
00:23:22.735,00:23:26.613,I thought this was what you liked.
00:23:26.655,00:23:30.326,"No, not at all."
00:23:31.660,00:23:35.748,"Funny, I was just having this conversation last week with Kurt, and he asked me..."
00:23:35.789,00:23:37.541,So what kind of girls do you like?
00:23:37.583,00:23:43.505,"Oh, uh, I like it when they're natural and stuff; not a lot of makeup, not skintight clothes."
00:23:43.547,00:23:44.924,"That sort of thing, you know?"
00:23:44.965,00:23:47.134,Totally.
00:23:49.011,00:23:51.138,I feel like an idiot.
00:23:51.180,00:23:53.307,"No, no, this is my fault."
00:23:53.349,00:23:56.769,It isn't right for me to be here anyway.
00:23:58.229,00:24:01.523,"But I really like you, Rachel."
00:24:04.526,00:24:05.778,I gotta go.
00:24:15.746,00:24:17.497,My bad.
00:24:17.539,00:24:19.457,What are we gonna do about this?
00:24:21.210,00:24:22.711,Who are you texting?!
00:24:34.556,00:24:37.017,Stop that!
00:24:38.727,00:24:39.770,Think of something!
00:24:39.812,00:24:40.813,I brought my guitar.
00:24:40.854,00:24:42.564,Why don't we sing them a lullaby?
00:24:42.606,00:24:44.442,Give me this.
00:24:45.734,00:24:48.988,Want to see a real live music video?
00:25:58.140,00:25:59.557,Sing it again.
00:26:09.151,00:26:13.571,I think this is the first time they have all been asleep at the same time.
00:26:18.660,00:26:20.954,You got them to take a bath?
00:26:22.664,00:26:24.582,"What are you, an exorcist?"
00:26:27.294,00:26:28.628,"She's like a jet, right?"
00:26:33.675,00:26:35.635,What are you gonna do when the kid comes?
00:26:38.680,00:26:40.099,No latch system.
00:26:40.140,00:26:43.060,PUCK: You were awesome tonight.
00:26:43.102,00:26:47.022,I was surprised at how I kinda enjoyed it.
00:26:47.064,00:26:49.649,I was worried about you at first.
00:26:49.691,00:26:52.694,"You seemed distracted, all that texting to Mike."
00:26:52.736,00:26:56.156,"Distracted? I was the opposite, babe."
00:26:56.198,00:26:57.324,I was totally into it.
00:26:57.366,00:27:03.789,All I know is we proved something tonight: This parenting thing?
00:27:06.708,00:27:09.836,You set me up...
00:27:09.878,00:27:12.339,Looks like someone is running for drama queen again.
00:27:13.715,00:27:15.301,I thought we were friends.
00:27:15.342,00:27:16.718,And what made you think that?
00:27:17.970,00:27:19.679,You should be thanking me.
00:27:19.721,00:27:24.268,All I did was help you realize that your schoolgirl fantasy of running off with Finn was nothing but a fairytale.
00:27:24.310,00:27:26.395,You like him.
00:27:27.729,00:27:29.565,"Yeah, that's, that's what this is."
00:27:29.607,00:27:31.609,And you were just trying to eliminate the competition.
00:27:31.649,00:27:36.989,I was just helping him understand that you are not a viable second choice.
00:27:43.745,00:27:45.539,You think I'm living in a fairytale?
00:27:45.581,00:27:49.667,"If I were second or if I were 50th, I'd still be ahead of you because I'm a girl."
00:27:52.379,00:27:57.217,"Okay, here's the dope, princess: there's no hope for either of us."
00:27:57.259,00:28:00.929,He loves Quinn.
00:28:00.971,00:28:03.681,We're nothing but distractions.
00:28:04.850,00:28:08.812,The sooner we realize that...
00:28:13.025,00:28:15.986,Keep your paws off my man.
00:28:19.823,00:28:20.824,Who's your man?
00:28:20.866,00:28:22.742,"Don't play stupid, tubbers."
00:28:22.784,00:28:28.748,"Oh, and for the record, asking someone to babysit with you is super '90s."
00:28:28.790,00:28:32.169,I happen to know that Puck cares about me.
00:28:32.211,00:28:33.629,"Oh, wake up!"
00:28:33.671,00:28:36.549,"While you two were babysitting, Puck and I were sexting."
00:28:36.590,00:28:38.258,Sexting?
00:28:38.300,00:28:41.554,"Sexy texting. Seriously, what era are you from?"
00:28:41.595,00:28:47.767,"While you two were playing house, Puck and I were trading super-hot texts."
00:28:47.809,00:28:50.270,Why don't you check his cell phone?
00:28:50.312,00:28:53.440,'Cause my sexts are too hot to erase.
00:29:04.826,00:29:06.786,Thank you all for coming.
00:29:06.828,00:29:09.081,We are so honored to have you guys here.
00:29:09.122,00:29:13.877,"So, without further ado, I present The New Directions."
00:29:17.839,00:29:22.010,"Yes, so crazy right now."
00:29:22.052,00:29:29.476,"Most incredibly, it's your boy Artie, it's you're girl Mercedes."
00:29:29.518,00:29:31.019,You ready?
00:29:45.867,00:31:05.698,"ARTIE: It didn't work at all, did it?"
00:34:33.655,00:34:34.781,"Hey, baby."
00:34:36.199,00:34:37.784,You really don't want to do that.
00:34:42.163,00:34:43.749,I'm sorry.
00:34:43.790,00:34:45.124,I tried to resist Santana.
00:34:45.166,00:34:46.334,I did.
00:34:46.376,00:34:50.047,But I'm young and girls have this power over me.
00:34:50.088,00:34:51.297,"But, hey, it's all good."
00:34:51.339,00:34:53.132,It's definitely not all good.
00:34:53.174,00:34:54.342,I thought you wanted to be with me.
00:34:54.384,00:34:57.303,"I do. Like, a lot."
00:34:57.345,00:35:01.600,"But you haven't given it up to me since the night I knocked you up, and, baby, I'm a dude."
00:35:01.641,00:35:02.601,I have needs.
00:35:02.642,00:35:10.149,"So, you expect to raise a baby with me and text dirty messages to every other girl at this school if I don't give it up to you every day?"
00:35:10.191,00:35:12.861,No. Just the hot girls.
00:35:15.196,00:35:19.076,"Look, I'm going to be a good dad, but I'm not going to stop being me to do it."
00:35:22.287,00:35:23.413,QUINN: You can have her.
00:35:23.455,00:35:25.624,Are you serious?
00:35:25.665,00:35:27.918,A girl really needs a good father.
00:35:29.461,00:35:32.631,And the only way she's going to get that is if I give her to you.
00:35:34.215,00:35:37.094,"You think Mr. Shue's going to be a good father, don't you?"
00:35:39.596,00:35:41.014,Yeah.
00:35:41.056,00:35:43.850,I think he's going to be an amazing dad.
00:35:45.727,00:35:48.438,Will!
00:35:48.480,00:35:50.231,I thought you were going to be at the scrap yard all afternoon.
00:35:50.273,00:35:52.484,"Oh, yeah, Uh, change of plans."
00:35:54.653,00:35:57.196,"Uh, Quinn, what are you doing here?"
00:35:57.238,00:35:58.448,"Oh, girl talk."
00:35:58.490,00:36:01.118,We're exchanging pregnancy war stories.
00:36:01.159,00:36:04.203,"Oh, that's... nice."
00:36:04.245,00:36:06.873,"Well, when you get a sec, can you meet me out in the garage, Ter?"
00:36:16.341,00:36:17.759,Yes?
00:36:38.989,00:36:40.782,TERRI: You know I hate surprises.
00:36:49.708,00:36:50.750,Where's the Blue Bomber II?
00:36:50.792,00:36:52.544,I sold it to some kid.
00:36:52.585,00:36:53.545,For a tidy little profit.
00:36:53.586,00:36:55.047,Let him have the fun.
00:36:55.088,00:36:58.383,I made enough for a down payment on a car for our whole family.
00:36:59.551,00:37:01.761,"Oh, Terri."
00:37:05.473,00:37:07.184,And our little girl.
00:37:07.225,00:37:10.228,And I don't want anything to distract me from you guys.
00:37:17.318,00:37:18.361,Hi.
00:37:18.403,00:37:19.738,Hi.
00:37:21.198,00:37:23.867,Can we be in love again?
00:37:26.411,00:37:28.287,"I, uh..."
00:37:28.329,00:37:30.707,"I want us to be honest with each other, no matter what."
00:37:33.710,00:37:35.712,Cool. Uh...
00:37:35.754,00:37:37.964,It... It's not really even that big a deal.
00:37:38.006,00:37:43.762,"I mean, I didn't actually do anything, but, the other night, when you were babysitting..."
00:37:48.266,00:37:49.308,But nothing happened.
00:37:49.350,00:37:59.236,"I... just was worked up about us fighting and then she put on this really weird Catwoman suit, and so I think something could have happened, but it didn't."
00:38:00.612,00:38:02.822,Because I only want to be with you.
00:38:06.952,00:38:09.412,Thank you for being honest with me.
00:38:09.454,00:38:12.582,"I love you, Quinn."
00:38:16.086,00:38:18.213,"I love you, too."
00:38:57.043,00:38:58.336,"Hey, Sue. You got a sec?"
00:38:59.587,00:39:00.839,Sure.
00:39:00.880,00:39:04.217,I owe you an apology.
00:39:05.635,00:39:09.681,I did think the kids needed to be a little more showbiz and I was wrong.
00:39:09.722,00:39:12.225,That isn't who they are.
00:39:12.267,00:39:14.435,"So, thank you for helping me see that."
00:39:16.146,00:39:18.397,"Oh, and, uh, here's the new set list."
00:39:18.439,00:39:20.358,Mm-hmm.
00:39:22.694,00:39:24.779,"Wow, these are great choices, William."
00:39:24.821,00:39:26.405,Proud Mary.
00:39:26.447,00:39:27.782,Smokin' hot deep cut.
00:39:27.824,00:39:29.617,Smokin' hot!
00:39:29.659,00:39:30.660,Don't mock me.
00:39:30.702,00:39:31.577,Sorry.
00:39:31.619,00:39:33.412,"Oh, I don't recognize this last one."
00:39:33.454,00:39:34.914,"Oh, that's the new addition."
00:39:34.956,00:39:38.626,"Yeah, I want the kids to forget everything I taught them about Hairography because..."
00:39:38.668,00:39:40.503,We're starting from scratch.
00:39:41.754,00:39:43.422,"So, we're a stool choir now?"
00:39:43.464,00:39:45.633,Nope. We're not dancing with the stools.
00:39:45.675,00:39:48.928,No gimmicks. No false theatricality.
00:39:48.970,00:39:51.430,We're just going to sit in them and sing.
00:39:54.559,00:39:55.852,"Thanks, Mr. Schuester."
00:39:57.478,00:40:01.482,This is their set list from sectionals.
00:40:01.524,00:40:02.734,Don't Stop Believing.
00:40:06.321,00:40:15.038,"Now, I suggest you take these two songs, split them between your two groups, and I'll pull some strings and make sure that Schuester and his group perform last."
00:40:15.080,00:40:20.293,"That way, it'll look like he stole the songs from you."
00:40:20.335,00:40:22.712,"Um, who do you think I am?"
00:40:22.754,00:40:26.174,That's actually a very good question because I've forgotten both of your names.
00:40:26.216,00:40:33.723,"Look, I spend every waking hour of my day trying to teach those girls that lying and cheating is not the way you're ever going to get ahead."
00:40:33.765,00:40:37.518,"And you're suggesting I do exactly that, so that they can win a singing competition?"
00:40:37.560,00:40:39.145,"Yeah, pretty much."
00:40:41.731,00:40:45.735,I think you're missing an opportunity to give your girls a second chance.
00:40:45.777,00:40:47.653,These McKinley kids are going to do fine.
00:40:51.532,00:40:57.496,And I'd hate to see them so devastated by losing that they'd give up entirely.
00:40:57.538,00:41:00.375,You know how many deaf choirs have won this competition?
00:41:00.417,00:41:03.878,Okay. Everybody's going to need to speak up because I can't hear.
00:41:03.920,00:41:06.089,Deaf in one ear.
00:41:10.551,00:41:16.391,Never let anything distract you from winning.
00:41:17.850,00:41:20.019,Ever.
00:42:15.492,00:00:05.506,"TINA: ALL: TINA: ALL: So, here's what you missed last week: Emma and Ken are getting married, though it seems like she really likes Will."
00:00:05.547,00:00:09.134,"EMMA: I mean, if we were going to rank crushworthy teachers at this school, you'd be number one with a bullet."
00:00:09.176,00:00:12.095,"Which Ken's kind of noticed, which makes him really not like Will."
00:00:12.137,00:00:15.056,"You and I, the whole world knows that I'm just a consolation prize to you."
00:00:19.102,00:00:20.771,"but really, she's faking and Mr. Schuster doesn't know."
00:00:20.813,00:00:23.064,This baby's the only reason he's still here.
00:00:23.106,00:00:25.901,Will's busy getting the kids ready for Sectionals where they're up against a school for the Deaf...
00:00:25.943,00:00:28.529,I can't hear you. Talk into this ear. Scarlet fever.
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.574,...and a group of juvie girls.
00:00:32.616,00:00:34.159,"Aphasia, give Mr. Schuster his wallet back."
00:00:36.161,00:00:38.079,But it turns out both of them are really good.
00:00:38.121,00:00:40.749,It's like cool epilepsy.
00:00:38.121,00:00:42.167,"Also, Sue kicked Quinn out of the Cheerios because she's pregnant."
00:00:42.209,00:00:44.127,I can't have a pregnant girl on my squad.
00:00:44.169,00:00:45.754,You're a disgrace.
00:00:45.796,00:00:46.964,"It's not very nice, but neither is Sue."
00:00:49.132,00:00:50.801,And that's what you missed on...
00:01:00.769,00:01:03.564,"Hey, guys."
00:01:03.605,00:01:05.148,"So, what's with all the primping?"
00:01:05.190,00:01:07.108,Yearbook pictures.
00:01:10.988,00:01:16.368,"I'm going to drop 20 pounds by Friday, look smoking hot for that photo, and be down to a trim 210 for the wedding a week Saturday."
00:01:16.410,00:01:21.373,"EMMA: Of course, the wedding was going to be in Hawaii, but then they told me I couldn't bring my own fruit, so..."
00:01:21.415,00:01:24.209,"But, Sectionals is a week from Saturday."
00:01:27.170,00:01:29.214,"Looks like you won't be able to make it, Eminem."
00:01:30.883,00:01:34.511,"I, um, I totally forgot about Sectionals."
00:01:34.553,00:01:36.847,I'm-I'm sorry.
00:01:36.889,00:01:38.181,For the kids.
00:01:38.223,00:01:40.141,We're not rescheduling.
00:01:41.769,00:01:46.356,The only reason this Saturday is available is 'cause it's the one year anniversary of that grisly fish fry shoot-out.
00:01:52.195,00:01:53.822,"Oh, my gosh."
00:01:55.449,00:01:57.409,Did someone finally punch you?
00:01:57.451,00:01:58.994,Edie.
00:01:59.036,00:02:00.621,William. You.
00:02:02.205,00:02:06.251,"Every year, when the photos for the Thunderclap come around, I always elect to have a little work done."
00:02:06.293,00:02:08.253,"This year, I got myself a bit of an eye lift."
00:02:08.295,00:02:12.299,"And while they were in there, I told them to go ahead and yank out those tear ducts."
00:02:14.217,00:02:18.221,"You know, I got a storage unit full of trophies and medallions."
00:02:18.263,00:02:28.189,"But, for the rest of you educators, these yearbook pictures are really the only concrete proof you have that anything you've done in your sorry little lives has made any difference whatsoever."
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.903,Got them on a yam diet.
00:02:32.945,00:02:34.989,It draws the water out of the skin.
00:02:36.949,00:02:38.826,"Well, Glee kids don't get a photo."
00:02:41.244,00:02:54.633,"Well, I just had a meeting with Principal Figgins, Eleanor, and what with all the vandalism of the Glee Club photos over the years, I convinced him that putting the Glee kids in this year's Thunderclap was subjecting the little freaks to more humiliation and ridicule."
00:02:54.675,00:02:58.637,Why can't you just accept the fact that my kids are going to take Sectionals this year?
00:02:58.679,00:02:59.888,That's not happening.
00:02:59.930,00:03:01.682,And stop with the pointless vendetta.
00:03:01.723,00:03:02.891,EMMA: Right.
00:03:04.309,00:03:06.227,"You know, I'm going to talk to Figgins about this."
00:03:06.269,00:03:07.228,"Hey, good luck with that."
00:03:07.270,00:03:09.272,"You know, you three are boring me now."
00:03:09.314,00:03:13.152,I'm going to go do something else.
00:03:18.197,00:03:20.283,Where's Rachel?
00:03:20.325,00:03:21.284,She's not here yet.
00:03:21.326,00:03:22.953,Perfect.
00:03:25.288,00:03:28.249,We have all felt the cold humiliation of a slushie in the face.
00:03:28.291,00:03:35.298,"But as of right now, our relative anonymity as a club shields us from more severe persecution-- swirlies."
00:03:35.340,00:03:36.925,Patriotic wedgies.
00:03:39.178,00:03:41.930,It's when they hoist you up the flag pole by your undies.
00:03:44.307,00:03:51.356,"Based on my investigation, I am of the opinion that a yearbook photo would only fuel the flames of anti-Glee-Club terror."
00:03:51.398,00:03:53.400,I've done a little library research.
00:03:59.907,00:04:03.368,Peter Gellar.
00:04:03.410,00:04:07.288,He can be seen here with both a drawn on Hitler mustache and rice paddy hat.
00:04:16.339,00:04:17.674,He barks at my mom.
00:04:17.716,00:04:19.801,KURT: Exhibit B.
00:04:19.843,00:04:23.097,Tawny Peterson.
00:04:30.353,00:04:35.316,I think I speak for all of us when I say that not having to pose for a yearbook photo might be a blessing in disguise.
00:04:35.358,00:04:37.694,I suggest not fighting Figgins' ruling.
00:04:37.736,00:04:39.238,"WILL: Oh, hey, guys."
00:04:39.279,00:04:41.322,Ah. Looking at old Thunderclaps?
00:04:41.364,00:04:42.699,It's really unsettling.
00:04:48.247,00:04:50.331,You know what?
00:04:48.247,00:04:55.336,This year's Thunderclap is going to have a Glee Club photo with every one of your smiling faces.
00:04:55.378,00:04:56.880,You have my word on it.
00:05:05.555,00:05:08.349,"Shue, I'm doing the glee club a solid."
00:05:08.391,00:05:12.395,We're denying the opportunity to other children to further humiliate them.
00:05:12.437,00:05:17.358,"No, no, no. Those kids get up on stage all the time, no matter what anyone thinks of them, and they perform."
00:05:17.400,00:05:20.445,They don't let anyone or anything get to them.
00:05:20.487,00:05:22.447,That's something you should encourage.
00:05:22.489,00:05:23.949,Sue is wrong!
00:05:23.991,00:05:26.285,Fine. I'll give them a photo.
00:05:27.410,00:05:29.288,"For $1,000."
00:05:29.329,00:05:30.371,What?
00:05:32.415,00:05:36.377,"The yearbook is prime advertising space, Shue."
00:05:47.222,00:05:48.807,What about a quarter page?
00:05:48.849,00:05:50.391,How much does that cost?
00:05:54.021,00:05:55.814,$325.
00:05:55.856,00:06:00.401,That will buy you enough space for a photo of two members of the glee club.
00:06:00.443,00:06:04.198,Right below the advertisement for Uncle Sandro's Chicken Inside of a Waffle.
00:06:05.448,00:06:06.825,"It's a compromise, Shue."
00:06:06.867,00:06:16.417,"Now, I suggest you select a good-looking cheerleader-- not the pregnant one-- and the quarterback for the photo as their faces are less likely to be scratched out with safety pins."
00:06:16.459,00:06:18.295,"Mr. Schuster, I'm very sorry to interrupt."
00:06:30.140,00:06:31.350,"Beat you to the punch, Rachel."
00:06:32.475,00:06:33.643,We're in the yearbook.
00:06:33.685,00:06:36.646,Oh. Fantastic.
00:06:36.688,00:06:38.397,Thank you so much.
00:06:49.492,00:06:55.456,"Invasive as the press may be, stars are dependent on them for their fame, and I feel I must be prepared."
00:06:55.498,00:07:00.921,"In order to do so, I join every club I possibly can."
00:07:00.962,00:07:09.304,"know you're thinking that I'm just joining all of these clubs to give off the appearance that I'm involved, known to exist, but Glee Club is different."
00:07:09.346,00:07:13.058,I really love Glee and I believe in what we stand for.
00:07:13.100,00:07:23.277,"We've come from behind, dismissed and ridiculed by everyone, and we've made something of ourselves, something that I'm proud to be a part of, something I want to be remembered for."
00:07:26.613,00:07:28.198,"Oh, that's got the whole flag."
00:07:28.240,00:07:29.490,QUINN: I miss my Cheerios uniform.
00:07:29.532,00:07:32.493,Made me feel safe.
00:07:32.535,00:07:34.079,Contained.
00:07:34.121,00:07:38.792,"Even when I was feeling left out, at least I looked like I was a part of something."
00:07:41.544,00:07:47.508,"I want my kids to be able to look back at these books and see who I was, make them proud."
00:07:47.550,00:07:54.515,"Not the bastard one I'm carrying now, of course, the ones I'll have when I'm married and ready."
00:07:54.557,00:07:59.771,"I might not look like the head cheerleader anymore, but I'm still her on the inside."
00:08:02.565,00:08:10.782,"When that cheerleading picture is taken for the yearbook, I'm going to be in it and back on the squad, whether Sue Sylvester likes it or not."
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.329,"You're blocking the TV, Will."
00:08:15.370,00:08:16.830,"Oh, come on. I need your help."
00:08:16.871,00:08:18.539,School pictures are coming up.
00:08:22.252,00:08:24.796,Wear the red one for the teacher photo and the green one for the glee club.
00:08:26.256,00:08:28.300,It'll pop more when the cool kids deface it.
00:08:29.592,00:08:32.553,"Yeah. I, uh..."
00:08:34.597,00:08:41.729,"So, Figgins stopped putting the Glee Club photo in the yearbook because it always gets vandalized, and I just feel so bad for the kids."
00:08:41.771,00:08:44.816,"I mean, they work so hard."
00:08:44.858,00:08:48.569,Not being in that book gives the appearance that Glee Club isn't important.
00:08:52.615,00:08:55.702,I want to buy an ad and use it as the glee club photo spread.
00:08:58.288,00:08:59.831,It's around $300.
00:08:59.873,00:09:02.376,"Oh, great."
00:09:10.633,00:09:13.512,We have a couple hundred bucks left over from selling the Blue Bomber II.
00:09:13.553,00:09:15.472,"The answer's no, Will. No."
00:09:15.514,00:09:17.598,But if we...
00:09:17.640,00:09:20.560,No. No.
00:09:30.153,00:09:35.116,"Actually, can you wait to cash that until Thursday?"
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.840,I want us to start a GayLesbAll.
00:09:52.675,00:09:53.927,The Gay-Lesbian Alliance.
00:09:53.968,00:09:55.970,Gay-Lesb-All.
00:09:58.473,00:09:59.640,"Hey, guys!"
00:09:59.682,00:10:01.642,Great news!
00:10:01.684,00:10:03.728,Glee Club gets a photo in the Thunderclap.
00:10:03.770,00:10:06.565,Yep.
00:10:06.606,00:10:09.943,It's going to show everyone at the school that Glee Club is on its way up.
00:10:09.984,00:10:14.448,"When we win Regionals, those Claps are going to be collector's items."
00:10:14.489,00:10:17.700,"I mean, all of your classmates are going to be begging for your autographs."
00:10:19.702,00:10:22.581,But I had to compromise to do it.
00:10:22.622,00:10:25.208,"Um, we only get a quarter page in back."
00:10:30.713,00:10:33.883,"So, tomorrow we're going to put it to a vote."
00:10:33.925,00:10:35.594,"Exciting, huh?"
00:10:35.635,00:10:36.636,All right.
00:10:44.727,00:10:47.147,"Well, we're all here."
00:10:47.188,00:10:50.358,"With your permission, I have prepared a few words."
00:10:50.400,00:10:51.485,I nominate Rachel.
00:10:51.526,00:10:53.694,"All right, let's vote up in this piece."
00:10:53.736,00:10:57.657,I gotta go hit the gym and load up the Guns of Puckerone for the football picture.
00:11:01.744,00:11:04.664,Looks like everybody voted for Rachel.
00:11:05.624,00:11:07.708,Including Rachel.
00:11:07.750,00:11:09.710,"But we need two captains, guys."
00:11:09.752,00:11:10.711,Why two?
00:11:10.753,00:11:13.714,We're fine with having Rachel represent us in the Thunderclap by herself.
00:11:17.260,00:11:21.722,"WILL: The worst part is that after all this time, they're still embarrassed to be in Glee Club."
00:11:21.764,00:11:24.184,"I mean, they still see themselves as losers."
00:11:28.647,00:11:33.527,"Well, maybe you should let them use the captain they already elected."
00:11:38.615,00:11:43.286,"You know, none of this is going to matter if they win at Sectionals."
00:11:44.496,00:11:47.457,I'm really sorry I can't be there.
00:11:47.499,00:11:50.960,"Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about that."
00:11:55.882,00:11:59.594,"You know, so... so you couldn't go."
00:12:02.263,00:12:03.764,Come on.
00:12:03.806,00:12:08.311,We both know how he feels about our... relationship.
00:12:10.480,00:12:13.608,"I'm marrying Ken, Will."
00:12:14.901,00:12:21.949,"I've definitely given him reason in the past to be jealous, but I need you to know that I'm done with that now."
00:12:21.991,00:12:24.202,Ken has a lot of flaws.
00:12:24.244,00:12:28.415,"He has 74 flaws as of yesterday, but, you know what, he is not vindictive."
00:12:28.456,00:12:30.791,He's actually a very good man.
00:12:30.833,00:12:33.670,He is kind and he's great with the students here at McKinley.
00:12:33.712,00:12:35.463,We have that in common.
00:12:35.505,00:12:45.764,"And yes, it's true, his hygiene could be a lot better, but he is absolutely full of compassion and... well, that is why I'm marrying him."
00:12:47.726,00:12:49.269,You're right.
00:12:54.232,00:12:57.402,I was out of line.
00:12:57.444,00:12:59.237,It won't happen again.
00:13:07.662,00:13:09.623,"You wanted to see me, Mr. Shue?"
00:13:09.664,00:13:10.665,"Oh, yeah, Rach."
00:13:10.707,00:13:12.500,Sit down.
00:13:12.542,00:13:14.753,"So, how's the new captaincy going?"
00:13:14.793,00:13:19.549,I think that my unanimous election gave me a very strong mandate to shake things up.
00:13:29.892,00:13:31.852,We need a co-captain.
00:13:31.894,00:13:36.524,"You have so many great ideas, no reason you shouldn't have some help pushing them through."
00:13:36.566,00:13:38.735,I could use a trusty lieutenant.
00:13:38.777,00:13:41.488,I do have over 65 proposals.
00:13:41.529,00:13:44.658,"So, can I count on you?"
00:13:45.908,00:13:48.578,I'm on it.
00:13:51.830,00:13:52.791,"Kwanza's late December, Mercedes."
00:13:52.831,00:13:54.959,The photo's this Thursday.
00:14:00.632,00:14:04.927,"I'd love to be in the photo, Rachel, but you'd be standing and I'd be sitting and it would throw off the whole composition."
00:14:04.969,00:14:06.680,I'll lean over.
00:14:06.721,00:14:09.890,But if you lean over...
00:14:09.932,00:14:11.643,it will look like you have stomach rolls.
00:14:13.561,00:14:17.398,"On second thought, I don't think that you're leadership material, Artie."
00:14:17.440,00:14:19.442,Follower.
00:14:20.943,00:14:22.821,"Brittany, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity."
00:14:22.862,00:14:24.989,No way.
00:14:25.031,00:14:26.533,Because I don't want to be in a picture with you.
00:14:26.574,00:14:27.784,It'll get defaced.
00:14:27.826,00:14:29.619,"No, it won't."
00:14:29.661,00:14:31.496,I'll be the one doing it.
00:14:31.538,00:14:33.206,RACHEL: I'm desperate.
00:14:34.957,00:14:39.420,"I'm totally honored you asked me, but don't you think you should pick somebody who, like, cares more?"
00:14:39.462,00:14:42.923,"Not that I don't, but I just have football and friends and stuff."
00:14:45.844,00:14:50.598,"Face it, we wouldn't have all of the cheerleaders and football players in the club if it wasn't for you."
00:14:50.640,00:14:51.974,You know I love Glee Club.
00:14:52.016,00:14:54.435,I just don't know why I have to represent it.
00:14:54.477,00:14:57.438,"Because you're a leader, Finn."
00:14:57.480,00:14:59.357,And that's what leaders do.
00:14:59.399,00:15:01.818,They stick their necks out for people that they care about.
00:15:02.985,00:15:04.779,There are stakes here.
00:15:04.821,00:15:05.946,"Morale is low, you know it."
00:15:08.991,00:15:10.410,and then the club is over.
00:15:10.451,00:15:13.329,I can't do this alone.
00:15:13.371,00:15:14.914,You don't have to.
00:15:15.665,00:15:16.957,I am a leader.
00:15:16.999,00:15:21.546,"That's who I am, who I want to be."
00:15:21.588,00:15:23.172,You got yourself a co-captain.
00:15:24.632,00:15:26.050,I'll do the picture with you.
00:15:33.015,00:15:40.398,"I totally understand that as captain of the football team, you've worked really hard to project an appearance of steely toughness, but Glee Club is different."
00:15:40.440,00:15:44.985,We have to present the appearance of positivity and optimism.
00:15:45.027,00:15:52.660,"So... we're gonna practice, and I'm going to teach you how to smile correctly for your photo."
00:16:15.224,00:17:41.268,BOTH: What the hell?!
00:17:41.310,00:17:43.688,"Hey, man, shh, we're practicing, dude. Chill out."
00:17:43.730,00:17:46.733,"We heard you're going to be in the Glee Club photo, and we don't want to mess up messing it up."
00:17:46.774,00:17:47.984,"Screw you, Karofsky!"
00:17:48.026,00:17:49.736,I'm sick of you pulling people down.
00:17:49.777,00:17:52.405,"Hey, man, don't talk that Kum-Bah-Yay-Yah crap."
00:17:52.446,00:17:55.742,"All right, you know the system's put in place to keep order around here."
00:17:55.783,00:17:58.118,"You know what, I'm gonna give you some options, okay?"
00:17:58.160,00:18:04.000,"Do you want me to put the Hitler mustache on your Glee Club picture, or you want the buck teeth on your Glee Club picture?"
00:18:04.042,00:18:05.376,It don't matter to me either way.
00:18:05.418,00:18:06.711,I'll put...
00:18:08.170,00:18:09.714,I'm gonna write it on his forehead.
00:18:09.756,00:18:11.799,His big ol' potato head.
00:18:24.771,00:18:26.898,Can we shake a leg here?
00:18:31.193,00:18:32.612,I'm ready.
00:18:32.653,00:18:35.907,I'll... do it myself.
00:18:38.993,00:18:42.121,I insist on only being shot from my left side.
00:18:50.838,00:18:52.423,"Yeah, I kind of need to see your teeth."
00:18:52.465,00:18:53.758,It's sort of my job here.
00:18:53.800,00:18:56.385,"I'm sorry, I'm just..."
00:18:56.427,00:18:59.847,My co-captain bailed and it just...
00:18:59.889,00:19:02.308,"I'm sorry, I just need a minute."
00:19:05.853,00:19:07.605,RACHEL: Snap out of this.
00:19:07.647,00:19:12.902,"Stop being defined by what other people think of you, or how they disappoint you."
00:19:12.944,00:19:15.613,"It's lonely at the top, you know that."
00:19:15.655,00:19:19.993,What's that song about overcoming professional and personal disappointments?
00:19:20.034,00:19:21.828,"Oh, yeah."
00:19:34.090,00:19:35.174,I'm ready.
00:19:48.146,00:19:49.856,Great.
00:19:51.691,00:19:52.692,"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:19:52.733,00:19:54.027,That-that's it?
00:19:54.068,00:19:59.949,"I practiced over 18 different poses for this shoot, and I haven't even shown you any of my over the left shoulder pose. See?"
00:19:59.991,00:20:01.159,"Sorry, kid, I got to blow."
00:20:01.200,00:20:02.493,I got a casting session in half an hour.
00:20:02.535,00:20:06.080,A... a casting session for what?
00:20:06.122,00:20:08.541,My brother-in-law is shooting a commercial for his store.
00:20:08.582,00:20:09.834,I'm directing it.
00:20:09.876,00:20:12.294,I just do these school photos for the money.
00:20:17.008,00:20:18.092,"Uh, uh, okay."
00:20:18.134,00:20:19.343,"Wait, no, don't..."
00:20:21.595,00:20:23.556,I can cry on demand.
00:20:23.597,00:20:25.099,It's one of my many talents.
00:20:25.141,00:20:31.271,"I'm very versatile, and aside from nudity and the exploitation of animals, I'll pretty much do anything to break into the business."
00:20:37.319,00:20:38.946,there's other speaking parts in this thing.
00:20:38.988,00:20:42.282,"I need, like, a bunch of other actors, too."
00:20:42.324,00:20:45.285,I can help with that.
00:20:48.330,00:20:49.916,"Oh, hello, Finn."
00:20:49.957,00:20:51.876,How nice of you to show.
00:20:51.918,00:20:52.960,"FINN: Look, I'm sorry."
00:20:55.337,00:21:01.928,"They said that if I took the Glee Club photo, that they'd make me choose between an Hitler mustache or buck teeth, and I can't rock either of those looks."
00:21:09.351,00:21:11.145,Do you think I have a potato head?
00:21:14.398,00:21:20.821,"Okay, and you're convinced that we can't win, and you're content to just sit idle by until Figgins cancels the club."
00:21:20.863,00:21:25.952,"Well, I'm about to present to you a rare opportunity."
00:21:25.993,00:21:29.705,The opportunity to become stars.
00:21:31.373,00:21:35.836,We've all been cast in a local commercial.
00:21:36.963,00:21:38.923,Are you serious?
00:21:36.963,00:21:45.012,"Yes, Finn, and while all of you have been so concerned with your appearance in this school, I've landed Glee Club its first big break."
00:21:47.556,00:21:52.812,"Okay, and no one messes with celebrities or defaces their pictures."
00:21:52.853,00:21:54.438,What's the commercial?
00:21:54.480,00:21:57.316,Hold on to your hats and get ready to sell...
00:21:59.401,00:22:01.070,...some mattresses!
00:22:03.072,00:22:04.949,I'm getting a nice pair of black suspenders.
00:22:06.408,00:22:07.827,My mom's going to be really proud.
00:22:07.868,00:22:09.411,Let's do our camera face.
00:22:15.042,00:22:18.004,I can't believe we're finally breaking into the biz!
00:22:18.045,00:22:20.547,"You guys, I want us to always remember this moment."
00:22:20.589,00:22:28.097,"Soon, there may be agents and managers and movie deals, but right now I want us to remember what it feels like to be here together as a team."
00:22:28.139,00:22:31.976,"Whatever. Soon as I get my record deal, I'm not speaking to any of you."
00:22:33.435,00:22:36.063,"Okay, guys, we're very excited to have you here."
00:22:36.105,00:22:41.861,We here at Mattress Land believe that mattresses aren't just for sleeping and fornicating anymore.
00:22:41.902,00:22:45.906,We believe that buying an affordable mattress should be fun.
00:22:45.948,00:22:47.283,"All right, let's go over the script."
00:22:47.325,00:22:48.784,I think it's pretty brilliant.
00:22:48.826,00:22:50.870,I wrote it myself.
00:22:50.911,00:22:53.413,"Ah, me."
00:22:53.455,00:22:55.041,What's wrong?
00:22:55.082,00:22:57.793,We just lost our jobs...
00:22:57.835,00:23:01.297,"at the factory, and we can't get a good night's sleep."
00:23:01.339,00:23:02.464,RACHEL: Chipper up!
00:23:02.506,00:23:04.300,Come on down to Mattress Land.
00:23:04.342,00:23:09.096,We've got near-wholesale prices to fit your style and pocketbook.
00:23:09.138,00:23:12.099,I-I'm sorry.
00:23:13.267,00:23:18.438,"This script is brilliant, but we're a glee club, and we should perform."
00:23:23.069,00:23:25.863,What did you have in mind?
00:24:34.223,00:24:36.016,Jump!
00:25:17.266,00:25:19.726,Come on down to Mattress Land!
00:25:19.768,00:25:22.855,ALL: Come on down to Mattress Land!
00:25:31.613,00:25:34.200,"Terri, have you seen my pocket square?"
00:25:36.910,00:25:38.496,Terri?
00:26:12.446,00:26:13.780,Terri?
00:26:13.822,00:26:18.118,A pocket square's gonna make you look like Ted Knight.
00:26:18.160,00:26:21.621,What is this?
00:26:21.663,00:26:24.291,It's a pregnancy pad.
00:26:24.333,00:26:30.047,They have them at the maternity stores for trying on clothes so you can see how you're gonna look when you're showing.
00:26:30.089,00:26:36.220,Kendra stole it for me so I could see if any of her old clothes would fit...
00:26:36.262,00:26:38.055,Pick up your shirt.
00:26:38.097,00:26:39.890,What?
00:26:39.932,00:26:41.016,No.
00:26:44.686,00:26:46.146,"You're scaring me, Will."
00:26:47.356,00:26:50.650,Think about what you're accusing me of.
00:26:56.282,00:26:59.785,Please?
00:27:10.712,00:27:13.132,Why did you do this to us?
00:27:14.716,00:27:16.260,I thought you were leaving me.
00:27:16.302,00:27:17.344,"You're so different, Will."
00:27:17.386,00:27:18.678,We both know it.
00:27:18.720,00:27:20.180,You're pulling away from me.
00:27:20.222,00:27:22.141,"Why, because I-I've started standing up to you?"
00:27:22.182,00:27:23.683,Trying to make this a relationship of equals?
00:27:23.725,00:27:25.769,"No, because of the damn Glee Club."
00:27:25.811,00:27:29.356,"Ever since you started it, you just walk around like you're better than me!"
00:27:29.398,00:27:32.151,I should be allowed to feel good about myself!
00:27:32.192,00:27:33.527,"Who are we kidding, Will?"
00:27:33.569,00:27:37.781,This marriage works because you don't feel good about yourself.
00:27:37.823,00:27:44.622,"This marriage works because I love you, because I've always accepted you, good and bad."
00:27:44.662,00:27:47.791,You loved the girl you met when you were 15.
00:27:47.833,00:27:49.209,I'm not that girl.
00:27:49.251,00:27:52.212,You've made yourself a stranger to me now.
00:27:52.254,00:27:54.632,Are you happy?
00:27:54.672,00:27:56.716,It didn't start as a lie.
00:27:56.758,00:27:59.345,I really thought I was pregnant.
00:27:59.386,00:28:03.390,"And then the doctor, he said it was a hysterical pregnancy, and I..."
00:28:08.395,00:28:10.314,This is insane.
00:28:10.356,00:28:14.276,What were you gonna do when the due date came?
00:28:16.820,00:28:17.988,Quinn Fabray.
00:28:18.030,00:28:20.740,It was so perfect.
00:28:20.782,00:28:24.453,"She didn't want hers, and I needed one."
00:28:24.495,00:28:30.376,I had the doctor use her ultrasound DVD at your appointment that you came to.
00:28:36.089,00:28:38.133,I really loved you.
00:28:38.175,00:28:39.468,"I'm so sorry, Will."
00:28:39.510,00:28:41.845,I'm so sorry.
00:28:41.887,00:28:43.389,Do you remember at that appointment?
00:28:43.430,00:28:44.764,Do you remember what we said?
00:28:44.806,00:28:48.852,"That at that moment, no matter what happened, we loved each other."
00:28:48.894,00:28:50.229,We could get that feeling back again.
00:28:50.270,00:28:51.647,"You could love me back, Will!"
00:28:51.689,00:28:53.691,"Please, Will!"
00:28:53.732,00:28:55.734,"Please, don't go!"
00:29:02.408,00:29:04.702,"Oh, God."
00:30:19.901,00:30:24.864,"SUE: Am I asking for too much, Ohio Board of Statewide Holiday Planning?"
00:30:24.906,00:30:30.870,All I want is just one day a year where I'm not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties.
00:30:30.912,00:30:33.749,"Seriously, Ohio, these retinas need a day off."
00:30:33.791,00:30:39.338,"So here's the dream: Friday after Christmas-- which I have off-- if you're hideous, stay at home."
00:30:44.926,00:30:46.886,And that's how Sue sees it.
00:30:48.930,00:30:50.890,"Slammin', Sue."
00:30:50.932,00:30:53.310,We'll be right back.
00:30:55.312,00:31:00.275,"Hey, Andrea, that Sue's Corner I just did, was talking about you."
00:31:01.860,00:31:03.903,RACHEL: Who says finding a mattress can't be fun?
00:31:03.945,00:31:08.908,"At Mattress Land, we have mattresses of all shapes and sizes at prices that won't break your pocketbook."
00:31:08.950,00:31:10.828,No credit? No problem!
00:31:10.869,00:31:17.292,Mattress Land has a no-hassle financing of 12.9% with no money down and no payments till next year.
00:31:17.334,00:31:19.211,You'll jump for joy at our prices.
00:31:19.252,00:31:22.005,ALL: Come on down to Mattress Land!
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.801,"Coach Sylvester, we need to talk."
00:31:25.843,00:31:28.303,"Oh, I got nothing to say to you, prego."
00:31:28.345,00:31:31.139,"The Cheerios' photo's tomorrow, and I want back on that squad."
00:31:31.181,00:31:32.932,"Oh, is that what you want?"
00:31:32.974,00:31:42.401,"Well, what I wanted was a head cheerleader who wasn't going to hoist her legs behind her ears in the backseat of the first station wagon she could jimmy open, throwing away any chance she ever had in life."
00:31:42.442,00:31:44.444,It would be good for the school.
00:31:44.486,00:31:46.530,Show everyone that appearances don't matter.
00:31:46.572,00:31:49.199,That sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity.
00:31:49.241,00:31:51.618,I learned that in Glee Club.
00:31:51.660,00:32:00.377,"Well, that little educational proverb must have slithered from Will Schuester's mouth right after his lesson on how to disqualify yourselves from Sectionals."
00:32:00.419,00:32:01.378,What?
00:32:01.420,00:32:04.005,Saw your little commercial last night.
00:32:04.047,00:32:06.633,"Boy, did you Glee kids step in it."
00:32:08.635,00:32:10.554,"Shue, I'm afraid Sue is right."
00:32:10.596,00:32:12.138,You have indeed stepped in it.
00:32:14.307,00:32:15.642,"Of course, you didn't, William."
00:32:15.684,00:32:19.605,You wouldn't know if your glee club was using your office to breed rabbits for pets or for food. And you know why?
00:32:19.646,00:32:23.859,You're too busy chasing tail and loading your hair with enormous amounts of product!
00:32:23.901,00:32:26.152,"I mean, today it just looks like you put lard in it."
00:32:26.194,00:32:28.447,What are you even talking about?!
00:32:37.038,00:32:38.373,It was an innocent mistake.
00:32:38.415,00:32:41.376,"And what if I were to just innocently murder you, Will?"
00:32:41.418,00:32:43.420,I'd still have to go to trial.
00:32:43.462,00:32:45.004,Probably get off with justifiable homicide.
00:32:45.046,00:32:47.299,Let me review the rules for you.
00:32:47.340,00:32:57.935,"William, amendment 63, seventh addendum: No professional activity of any kind will be tolerated, and payment for services rendered negates amateur status, triggering immediate disqualification."
00:32:57.976,00:33:00.854,"Hey, hey."
00:33:00.896,00:33:01.730,"Hey, what, mister?!"
00:33:01.772,00:33:03.440,"No, keep it simple, folks!"
00:33:03.482,00:33:04.691,Keep it simple.
00:33:04.733,00:33:07.026,"Hey, I'm sorry, Shue, but I cannot let this slide."
00:33:07.068,00:33:09.028,But the kids weren't even paid!
00:33:09.070,00:33:15.243,There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles in the Dumpster outside your apartment!
00:33:15.285,00:33:16.411,"Okay, we'll give the mattresses back."
00:33:16.453,00:33:18.037,"Shue, one of those mattresses was used."
00:33:21.082,00:33:23.084,You can't even donate one to charity.
00:33:23.126,00:33:25.712,"Lice, bedbugs-- I looked it up online!"
00:33:25.754,00:33:28.632,"Is there any reason that you have a soiled mattress in your office, Will?"
00:33:28.674,00:33:35.054,Have you and the redhead become so sexually depraved that you have to commit your craven acts of adultery in between classes?
00:33:35.096,00:33:36.055,What?
00:33:36.097,00:33:38.057,"You know what, okay, fine."
00:33:38.099,00:33:40.101,"I slept here, all right?"
00:33:40.143,00:33:41.770,Excuse me?
00:33:47.609,00:33:49.444,I'm thinking about leaving my wife.
00:33:49.486,00:33:51.154,"Well, I didn't see that one coming at all."
00:33:51.196,00:33:56.368,"William, I am very sorry about your personal troubles but my hands are tied."
00:33:56.409,00:33:58.495,Sue's right-- you broke the rules.
00:33:58.537,00:34:00.539,I cannot fight the scholastic board.
00:34:00.580,00:34:03.834,I'm sorry but Glee Club is over.
00:34:05.919,00:34:09.506,It's over!
00:34:28.149,00:34:31.737,This is a day that will live in infamy.
00:34:31.778,00:34:35.532,"Once again, I've won."
00:34:37.576,00:34:39.036,Miss Sylvester.
00:34:43.164,00:34:45.625,It's like looking at a porno star in a nun's habit.
00:34:45.667,00:34:48.503,I wanted to show you that it still fits.
00:34:48.545,00:34:52.131,"My baby bump isn't that bad, it's just like I had a big lunch."
00:34:52.173,00:34:53.550,Take it off.
00:34:53.592,00:34:58.221,"You need to get it through your pregnant head, there's no way you're getting in that photo or back on the Cheerios."
00:34:58.263,00:34:59.180,End of story.
00:34:59.222,00:35:02.141,You're a hypocrite.
00:35:02.183,00:35:06.145,I just heard that you got Glee Club's amateur status revoked over a mattress.
00:35:09.566,00:35:13.194,"I've gotten free shoes, complimentary tanning, haircuts."
00:35:13.236,00:35:16.656,The season tickets to Cedar Point-- we sold those on eBay.
00:35:18.491,00:35:23.162,"It seems to me that if Figgins found out, you would get banned from competition."
00:35:23.204,00:35:24.873,Fine.
00:35:24.915,00:35:26.583,You're back on the Cheerios.
00:35:26.625,00:35:31.337,I'll put you on full-time dry cleaning duty and shove you to the back of the photo to hide your shame.
00:35:31.379,00:35:33.172,I'm not finished.
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.592,Glee Club gets a full page photo.
00:35:35.634,00:35:37.176,That's not up to me.
00:35:37.218,00:35:45.727,You are giving up one of the Cheerios' six pages and you are giving it to the Glee Club free of charge.
00:35:47.228,00:35:52.692,"You know, Q, I'd forgotten just how ruthless you really are."
00:35:54.319,00:35:56.195,You're like a young Sue Sylvester.
00:35:56.237,00:35:58.657,"Now, get out of my office."
00:35:58.698,00:36:03.036,If you can manage to squeeze through the door without your water breaking all over my new carpet.
00:36:03.078,00:36:05.246,You know what?
00:36:05.288,00:36:08.249,I don't think I want to be a Cheerio after all.
00:36:08.291,00:36:11.252,I don't want to be on a team where I only appear to belong.
00:36:11.294,00:36:16.758,I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me like Glee Club.
00:36:22.180,00:36:24.724,It's my fault.
00:36:24.766,00:36:28.520,"If I hadn't slept on that mattress, we could've just returned them and moved on."
00:36:32.315,00:36:34.609,You need to give yourself a break.
00:36:34.651,00:36:36.528,You do.
00:36:36.569,00:36:38.530,"You'll figure out what to do with the kids, you always do."
00:36:38.571,00:36:43.284,But I think right now you really need to focus on your own life.
00:36:43.326,00:36:45.495,"You know, divorce is a really big deal."
00:36:47.164,00:36:49.290,Who said anything about getting a divorce?
00:36:49.332,00:36:52.502,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry."
00:36:52.544,00:36:56.255,I just assumed that that's...
00:36:56.297,00:36:58.091,Is that what you would do?
00:36:58.133,00:37:02.428,"Well, um..."
00:37:02.470,00:37:08.518,"When I first heard about what Terri had done, oh, gosh, no, I thought there should be some sort of law."
00:37:08.560,00:37:17.318,"But then when I thought about it some more, thought about what I would've done if I'd felt you slipping away..."
00:37:17.360,00:37:19.571,You would never be that cruel.
00:37:19.612,00:37:27.829,"No, her methods were wrong, but, um, I totally understand her intentions."
00:37:31.833,00:37:34.502,"You're a lot to lose, Will."
00:37:37.547,00:37:40.466,But we don't want to go to Sectionals without you.
00:37:42.343,00:37:44.179,It's without me or not at all.
00:37:46.223,00:37:51.310,"Look, I was the one who slept on the mattress, which means I accepted them, not you."
00:37:56.399,00:37:58.484,He's taking the bullet for us.
00:37:58.526,00:38:00.403,Solid.
00:38:02.363,00:38:06.492,We have worked too hard for you guys not to get your shot.
00:38:06.534,00:38:08.787,"We can't do this without you, Mr. Shue."
00:38:08.828,00:38:10.538,"Hell, we probably can't do it with you."
00:38:10.580,00:38:11.748,That's not true.
00:38:12.665,00:38:16.335,You guys are good.
00:38:16.377,00:38:18.296,You're really good.
00:38:19.672,00:38:22.300,"You did Jump for that commercial without me, right?"
00:38:29.474,00:38:34.353,They just point the way and let you make your own choices.
00:38:34.395,00:38:38.650,Your own mistakes.
00:38:38.691,00:38:43.529,That way you get all the glory.
00:38:43.571,00:38:48.160,And you deserve it.
00:38:56.501,00:38:59.420,"We're really sorry, Mr. Shue."
00:38:59.462,00:39:03.258,I know.
00:39:03.300,00:39:08.013,I want you guys to go get gussied up and take that Glee Club photo with pride.
00:39:09.514,00:39:14.894,I want to see a smile on every one of your faces.
00:29:51.998,00:00:06.047,"SECTIONALS JUDGES ROOM... 12:15 PM CANDACE DYSTRA 5TH RUNNER-UP MISS OHIO 2006 ROD REMINGTON CO-ANCHOR WOHN-TV / OHIO LEGEND DONNA LANDRIES OHIO VICE COMPTROLLER / STATE PAID CYNIC So, here's what you missed last week: Will found out Terri's fake pregnant.Yikes."
00:00:06.089,00:00:07.132,"Will left, and he's sleeping at school."
00:00:11.094,00:00:13.054,"And Quinn's pregnant, but Puck's the father, not Finn."
00:00:17.100,00:00:19.979,And Sue gave the competition Will's set list for Sectionals.
00:00:20.020,00:00:24.065,"And Ken and Emma's wedding is that same day, so Will can't go to the wedding and Emma can't go to Sectionals."
00:00:25.526,00:00:27.068,And that's what you missed on...
00:00:31.114,00:00:33.993,I bet we get stuck with Mr. Sinacori as our Sectionals advisor.
00:00:34.034,00:00:35.494,"Oh, the creepy math teacher?"
00:00:35.536,00:00:37.579,He's always singing when he walks down the halls.
00:00:37.621,00:00:38.664,"Hey, guys."
00:00:38.706,00:00:43.002,Did any of you think it was weird the way that Puck rushed to Quinn's aid during rehearsal yesterday?
00:00:44.753,00:00:46.463,Is it the baby?
00:00:46.505,00:00:49.257,Think we're supposed to get hot towels.
00:00:49.299,00:00:51.176,"There's, like, sweat on the floor. I slipped, okay?"
00:00:51.218,00:00:52.761,I'm fine!
00:00:55.389,00:00:56.390,No.
00:00:56.431,00:00:57.683,"I mean, he likes her."
00:00:59.309,00:01:02.103,"RACHEL: Yeah, but it seemed like more than that."
00:01:02.145,00:01:05.357,"I've never told you guys this before, but I'm a little psychic."
00:01:05.399,00:01:09.028,"I can't read minds or anything yet, but I do have a sixth sense."
00:01:09.069,00:01:11.488,Something is definitely going on there.
00:01:13.365,00:01:15.116,We have to practice.
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.330,There's nothing to be scared of.
00:01:20.372,00:01:22.583,"I mean, it... it's not like Carrie or anything."
00:01:24.167,00:01:25.377,Hey. She's onto it.
00:01:27.086,00:01:28.296,Hold up.
00:01:30.173,00:01:31.132,"Dudes, this is serious."
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.052,"If she finds out, she's going to tell Finn."
00:01:34.177,00:01:35.637,Kurt wants in.
00:01:38.181,00:01:39.934,I volunteer my basement.
00:01:42.101,00:01:43.144,We just heard.
00:01:44.187,00:01:45.564,Why would I do that?
00:01:45.606,00:01:47.232,To get back at Puck.
00:01:47.274,00:01:48.567,Sex is not dating.
00:01:48.609,00:01:51.111,"If it were, Santana and I would be dating."
00:01:52.863,00:01:54.823,"Look, I don't want to rock the boat."
00:01:54.865,00:01:57.200,"Since Quinn got pregnant, I'm top dog around here."
00:01:59.202,00:02:01.121,"Hey, hot mama?"
00:02:02.372,00:02:03.331,She's gone.
00:02:03.373,00:02:10.089,"Look, I know I screwed up telling all you guys about Quinn and Puck, and I feel really terrible about it, but we cannot let Rachel figure this out."
00:02:10.130,00:02:12.173,"If she tells Finn, he's going to flip."
00:02:12.215,00:02:21.600,"And then, we really have no chance at Sectionals."
00:02:21.642,00:02:23.143,Are you sure about this?
00:02:24.436,00:02:26.563,But the wedding is on Saturday.
00:02:26.605,00:02:27.606,Your wedding.
00:02:31.234,00:02:32.277,"Really, I want to do this, Will."
00:02:32.319,00:02:34.863,I want to take the kids to Sectionals.
00:02:39.242,00:02:42.203,I appealed to him as an educator.
00:02:42.245,00:02:43.872,You will always choose Schuester over me.
00:02:43.914,00:02:45.124,"He won't even be there, Ken."
00:02:45.165,00:02:47.042,I am doing this for the kids.
00:02:45.165,00:02:48.919,I really thought that you of all people would understand this.
00:02:48.961,00:02:52.171,"This time, I don't think that I do."
00:02:56.259,00:02:57.260,Just great.
00:02:59.680,00:03:01.890,I can't thank you enough.
00:03:07.521,00:03:09.148,RACHEL: Hey.
00:03:09.188,00:03:13.443,"I know it's not my place, but have you had your doctor run the full genetic test panel on your unborn child?"
00:03:13.485,00:03:19.158,"I only ask because my cousin, Leon, and his wife got pregnant, and then they found out that he was a carrier for Tay-Sachs."
00:03:20.325,00:03:23.244,It's a genetic disorder-- pretty terrible from what I understand.
00:03:28.959,00:03:30.544,"No, Leon's... Leon's baby was fine."
00:03:30.585,00:03:33.005,"pretty scary, though."
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.551,My doctor never mentioned that.
00:03:37.592,00:03:39.302,You know... I'm such an idiot.
00:03:39.344,00:03:42.139,They would only run the test if one of the parents was Jewish.
00:03:42.181,00:03:44.307,"Yeah, only Jews carry the gene."
00:03:44.349,00:03:46.560,"Okay, I'll see you in rehearsal."
00:03:46.601,00:03:50.313,You have to take me to go get those Jewish baby tests.
00:03:51.523,00:03:54.776,"Because, if something is wrong with the baby, Terri Schuester isn't going to take it."
00:03:54.818,00:03:55.903,And I can't ask Finn.
00:03:55.944,00:03:56.987,He'll know something's up.
00:03:58.321,00:04:00.199,Because I have my fight club.
00:04:00.240,00:04:01.909,"WILL: Hey, guys?"
00:04:07.330,00:04:11.501,Well... I have found my replacement.
00:04:11.543,00:04:13.461,"So, give it up for Ms. Pillsbury."
00:04:18.175,00:04:20.343,"So, do you even know anything about music?"
00:04:20.385,00:04:21.678,Well...
00:04:20.385,00:04:24.639,What's important is that she cares about you guys every bit as much as I do.
00:04:26.349,00:04:28.309,Now...
00:04:31.230,00:04:34.315,I-I don't know what the future holds for me...
00:04:34.357,00:04:40.614,"and for us, but I know, Saturday, you're going to make me proud."
00:04:40.655,00:04:43.158,You guys are going to be great.
00:04:44.367,00:04:46.954,So...
00:04:46.995,00:04:49.289,good-bye for now.
00:04:50.791,00:04:52.000,Wait.
00:04:52.042,00:04:53.293,What about our set list?
00:04:55.295,00:04:58.215,I... I can't help you with that.
00:05:03.386,00:05:05.264,"All right, guys."
00:05:08.391,00:05:11.061,"Well, we have to do Proud Mary in wheelchairs. That's in."
00:05:11.103,00:05:13.855,"And Don't Stop Believing, for sure."
00:05:13.897,00:05:16.399,What about the ballad?
00:05:13.897,00:05:19.153,I would be thrilled to contribute a ballad from my repertoire.
00:05:19.194,00:05:22.572,"MERCEDES: Miss Bossy Pants?at, Enough."
00:05:22.614,00:05:25.784,"I've worked just as hard as you, and I'm just as good as you."
00:05:25.826,00:05:28.245,"You know, you always end up stealing the spotlight."
00:05:28.287,00:05:31.999,"Mercedes, do you honestly think you're as strong of a balladeer as I am?"
00:05:32.040,00:05:39.547,"of my thing.kind EMMA: Okay, um, Rachel, why don't you let Mercedes give it a try?"
00:05:39.589,00:05:41.382,"Thanks, Mrs. P."
00:05:41.424,00:05:43.260,Rachel.
00:05:43.302,00:05:45.095,Do I even need to tell you what song?
00:05:45.137,00:05:47.346,"Horns, strings, keep up."
00:08:08.613,00:08:10.490,Thoughts?
00:08:12.784,00:08:14.577,It's clear the room adores you.
00:08:16.204,00:08:19.833,"And, although it wouldn't be my first choice, well..."
00:08:19.874,00:08:22.627,I can't wait to see you sing that song at Sectionals.
00:08:24.212,00:08:28.216,"You're amazing, Mercedes, and you deserve it."
00:08:29.592,00:08:30.718,Okay. Come on.
00:08:36.308,00:08:38.059,That was pretty cool in there.
00:08:40.270,00:08:41.562,It was the right thing to do.
00:08:43.190,00:08:44.358,Yeah.
00:08:46.609,00:08:48.278,I'm kind of pumped about Sectionals.
00:08:48.320,00:08:50.280,This has been a...
00:08:50.322,00:08:54.075,hard couple of months-- with Quinn and the baby and everything and...
00:08:54.117,00:08:56.828,I don't know-- I really think that...
00:09:00.623,00:09:02.167,You know?
00:09:03.502,00:09:05.337,It's not stupid at all.
00:09:07.422,00:09:08.840,Is something up with you?
00:09:10.633,00:09:11.885,Oh.
00:09:11.926,00:09:17.098,"And when you care about someone, you can't sit around and watch them suffer when you know you can do something about it."
00:09:18.141,00:09:19.559,What are you talking about?
00:09:20.643,00:09:22.729,I have to tell you something.
00:09:35.742,00:09:37.618,"Hey, come on, come on."
00:09:37.660,00:09:39.913,Knock it off! Get off! Get off!
00:09:41.373,00:09:43.833,Tell the truth!
00:09:43.875,00:09:45.835,Don't play dumb-- you're too freaking dumb to play dumb.
00:09:48.671,00:09:50.715,"Obviously, it was Rachel."
00:09:50.757,00:09:53.009,"Yeah, it was Rachel, but I want to hear it from you."
00:09:53.051,00:09:55.136,I want to heart it from both of you.
00:09:55.178,00:09:56.846,No! They're both lying to me!
00:09:59.682,00:10:02.269,Just tell me-- is it true?
00:10:10.360,00:10:12.362,Yes.
00:10:13.613,00:10:15.615,Puck is the father.
00:10:23.915,00:10:25.292,"So, all..."
00:10:25.333,00:10:27.668,all that stuff in the hot tub...
00:10:33.716,00:10:36.677,I am so sorry.
00:10:36.719,00:10:38.179,Screw this.
00:10:38.221,00:10:39.806,I'm done with you.
00:10:41.391,00:10:43.351,I'm done with...
00:10:43.393,00:10:45.186,I'm done with all of you!
00:11:01.744,00:11:04.705,I'm so sorry.
00:11:04.747,00:11:07.667,I fully understand if you want to beat me up.
00:11:09.419,00:11:12.713,"If you can, just try to avoid my nose."
00:11:12.755,00:11:16.301,I'm not mad at you.
00:11:16.343,00:11:22.557,All you did was what I wasn't brave enough to do-- tell the truth.
00:11:25.393,00:11:28.896,I was selfish when I told him.
00:11:28.938,00:11:34.194,"I wanted to break you two up, so he would want to be with me."
00:11:34.235,00:11:37.614,And now neither of us have him.
00:11:38.657,00:11:42.202,I have hurt so many people.
00:11:46.998,00:11:49.000,Can you go now?
00:12:06.685,00:12:08.769,Hey.
00:12:12.857,00:12:15.569,But I want to be with you.
00:12:19.072,00:12:22.033,Thanks.
00:12:22.075,00:12:28.289,But I honestly can't handle any more stress in my life right now.
00:12:31.710,00:12:34.629,I'm going to do this on my own.
00:12:34.671,00:12:37.632,I know you don't understand it.
00:12:37.674,00:12:40.759,But please respect it.
00:13:02.115,00:13:05.201,"So, the competition starts at 11:00."
00:13:05.243,00:13:06.119,Right.
00:13:07.870,00:13:09.497,Three times.
00:13:10.540,00:13:14.335,"Reporting for duty, Mr. Schuester."
00:13:12.333,00:13:16.212,"I have to tell you, I get terrible public event anxiety."
00:13:16.254,00:13:17.297,"You know what, Jacob?"
00:13:17.338,00:13:19.215,It's okay. We just need a 12th member.
00:13:19.257,00:13:21.342,"All right, so, um, just sway in back."
00:13:21.384,00:13:22.302,You don't even have to sing.
00:13:22.343,00:13:23.762,"Yeah, don't even sing."
00:13:23.802,00:13:24.929,Okay.
00:13:32.895,00:13:34.855,No.
00:13:36.274,00:13:38.276,I can't thank you enough.
00:13:38.318,00:13:40.320,Okay.
00:14:20.860,00:14:23.904,"So, smooth sailing so far, we're all signed in."
00:14:26.157,00:14:30.328,"...according to the program, you have drawn performance slot number three."
00:14:32.413,00:14:34.207,Hardly.
00:14:35.958,00:14:39.920,My extensive auditioning for community theater has taught me that we either want to go first or last.
00:14:39.962,00:14:45.009,"If we're first, then everyone has to measure up to us, and if we're last, then we're freshest in the judges' minds."
00:14:45.051,00:14:46.969,And did you ever get any of those parts?
00:14:50.390,00:14:52.642,I'm with Rachel. On this.
00:14:55.228,00:14:57.230,"Yeah, Ms. Pillsbury's right."
00:15:02.985,00:15:05.154,Right.
00:15:16.457,00:15:18.877,It's a really popular song.
00:15:49.866,00:15:51.075,They're doing all of our numbers.
00:15:51.117,00:15:52.702,The kids are completely freaking out.
00:15:52.744,00:15:55.996,"Artie keeps ramming himself into the wall, and I'm pretty sure Jacob Ben Israel wet himself."
00:15:56.038,00:15:57.081,I knew it!
00:15:57.123,00:15:58.249,Sue leaked the set list.
00:15:58.291,00:16:00.668,Will...
00:16:00.710,00:16:03.463,"Will, these kids need a leader right now."
00:16:07.425,00:16:09.009,I know what to do.
00:16:14.432,00:16:16.517,Sue!
00:16:17.351,00:16:20.480,What kind of teacher are you?
00:16:20.521,00:16:22.816,"Hey, buddy! I just came by to feed my Venus flytrap."
00:16:22.857,00:16:24.024,You leaked the set list!
00:16:24.066,00:16:25.234,And you are not going to get away with it!
00:16:25.276,00:16:29.739,"That is a libelous accusation, and I insist you retract it immediately."
00:16:29.781,00:16:31.282,You have no proof.
00:16:31.324,00:16:32.283,No proof?
00:16:32.325,00:16:34.034,You are the only person who had the list!
00:16:34.076,00:16:37.037,"But other than that, you have no proof."
00:16:40.333,00:16:46.088,"At 1:00 p.m. this afternoon, your little club will have had its shot at the big time, and they will have failed."
00:16:46.130,00:16:56.349,"Glee Club will be canceled, and all that money Figgins has been funneling into your budget will finally and rightfully be restored to mine."
00:16:56.390,00:16:58.351,You have crossed the line.
00:16:58.392,00:17:01.729,I am not going to sit idly by anymore.
00:17:01.771,00:17:07.318,I am going to expose you for the fraud that you have become.
00:17:07.360,00:17:09.236,"Bring it on, William."
00:17:09.278,00:17:17.662,I'm reasonably confident that you will be adding revenge to the long list of things you're no good at-- right next to being being married...
00:17:17.704,00:17:19.288,Don't.
00:17:19.330,00:17:25.586,"...running a high school Glee Club, and finding a hairstyle that doesn't make you look like a lesbian."
00:17:25.628,00:17:28.088,Love ya like a sista.
00:17:28.130,00:17:30.132,Get your hands off me.
00:17:33.135,00:17:35.179,I didn't think so.
00:17:48.442,00:17:49.986,"Hey, Finn."
00:17:53.406,00:17:57.159,"Yeah, you know, football season ended, so I'm just cleaning out my things."
00:17:57.201,00:18:00.120,Sounds like something that could've waited till Monday.
00:18:00.162,00:18:03.332,You heard anything?
00:18:03.374,00:18:05.209,Yeah.
00:18:05.251,00:18:06.669,It's pretty bad.
00:18:09.213,00:18:11.966,I can't be there.
00:18:12.008,00:18:13.133,And I can?
00:18:13.175,00:18:16.846,I can't even be in the same room as her without crying like a girl.
00:18:16.888,00:18:19.933,I can't look at him without wanting to punch his face off.
00:18:21.976,00:18:24.103,You know I know how you feel.
00:18:30.192,00:18:31.861,But that's not fair.
00:18:37.116,00:18:40.536,Because sometimes being special...
00:18:40.578,00:18:43.497,sucks.
00:18:45.583,00:18:50.755,"I just want everything to be like it-- like it never happened, you know?"
00:18:50.797,00:18:53.132,"Well, Finn..."
00:18:55.134,00:18:57.595,...you can't always get what you want.
00:19:01.474,00:19:04.393,"Listen, I'll be in the choir room."
00:19:09.231,00:19:12.151,"No, I didn't."
00:19:18.240,00:19:19.283,"Nope, your money's no good here, I'm buying."
00:19:21.327,00:19:23.203,I don't feel much like celebrating.
00:19:23.245,00:19:24.497,Why not?
00:19:24.538,00:19:27.041,One of us is going to take this thing.
00:19:27.083,00:19:29.085,Hi.
00:19:29.836,00:19:31.211,Nice set list.
00:19:31.253,00:19:34.715,"Of course, I haven't heard your deaf kids perform yet, but I hear they're doing Don't Stop Believing."
00:19:34.757,00:19:36.216,"Um, who are you?"
00:19:36.258,00:19:38.011,"I'm so sorry, let me introduce myself."
00:19:38.052,00:19:39.512,I'm Emma Pillsbury.
00:19:39.553,00:19:41.889,I'm the faculty advisor for the McKinley High School Glee club.
00:19:41.931,00:19:44.600,Oh. What happened to the white guy with the Jheri curl?
00:19:46.644,00:19:48.437,You're educators.
00:19:48.479,00:19:50.272,"Actually, no, you know what?"
00:19:52.274,00:19:55.528,And you're teaching them that the only way they can compete in this world is by cheating.
00:19:55.569,00:19:57.279,"I'm sorry, but what kind of message is that?"
00:19:57.321,00:19:59.073,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:19:59.115,00:20:02.702,Don't Stop Believing is the most downloaded song in the history of iTunes.
00:20:07.957,00:20:09.291,In wheelchairs?
00:20:09.333,00:20:13.253,Do you have any idea how much winning is going to mean to my girls?
00:20:13.295,00:20:17.257,It's going to be a life changer-- make them feel like they're worth something again.
00:20:17.299,00:20:21.345,"I'm-I'm sorry, do you-- do you think that they're not going to know that something's up?"
00:20:21.387,00:20:25.683,The fact that you just magically came up with two brand-new numbers days before competition?
00:20:28.310,00:20:29.478,That's all I know.
00:20:34.316,00:20:36.276,"No, you know what the real shame is?"
00:20:36.318,00:20:40.322,Is that maybe if you believed in them just a little bit more they would've been amazing up there.
00:20:41.824,00:20:44.077,Without cheating.
00:21:00.551,00:21:02.887,Meeting in the Green Room in five minutes.
00:21:11.353,00:21:13.147,I know for a fact that's true.
00:21:13.189,00:21:15.108,Sue asked us to spy for her.
00:21:15.149,00:21:19.403,"SANTANA: Look, we may still be Cheerios, but neither of us ever gave Sue the set list."
00:21:19.445,00:21:23.199,"Well... I-I did, but I didn't know what she was going to do with it."
00:21:26.368,00:21:32.332,"Okay, look, believe what you want, but no one's forcing me to be here."
00:21:32.374,00:21:36.754,And if you ever tell anyone this I'll deny it-- but I like being in Glee Club.
00:21:40.382,00:21:42.342,I wasn't going to go and mess it up.
00:21:49.767,00:21:51.852,I believe you.
00:21:53.813,00:21:55.982,"Okay, look, guys, there's no point in us arguing anymore."
00:21:57.399,00:21:58.651,And we have no songs.
00:21:58.692,00:22:00.569,Perhaps I could improvise some of my Def Poetry Jams.
00:22:00.611,00:22:02.071,No.
00:22:02.113,00:22:03.363,"Look, we're going to do this the right way."
00:22:03.405,00:22:04.573,Let's start with the ballad.
00:22:04.615,00:22:06.242,"Mercedes, do you have anything else in your repertoire?"
00:22:06.284,00:22:08.410,"Yeah, but it's not as good as anything you're going to sing."
00:22:08.452,00:22:10.079,"No, we, we agreed..."
00:22:08.452,00:22:13.874,"We agreed that I would sing And I'm Telling You, and that ain't happening."
00:22:23.425,00:22:27.387,"If anyone is going to go belt it on the fly, it should be her."
00:22:29.431,00:22:32.185,"Well, I do have something that I've been working on since I was four."
00:22:36.438,00:22:37.898,It's a real crowd-pleaser.
00:22:37.940,00:22:39.859,"Yeah, that and a can of soup will guarantee us third place."
00:22:39.900,00:22:43.070,We still need another song we can all sing together.
00:22:52.621,00:22:54.207,I found the sheet music online.
00:22:54.248,00:22:58.669,I used the Cheerios' copier to make copies and then I trashed the thing.
00:23:02.464,00:23:06.426,"Mike, Matt, Brittany, Santana, you're our best dancers."
00:23:09.138,00:23:10.931,It's going to be choppy.
00:23:10.973,00:23:12.558,We're best when we're loose.
00:23:22.484,00:23:24.444,...we might have a shot at this thing.
00:23:28.157,00:23:29.575,"It's good to have you back, Finn."
00:23:32.078,00:23:33.704,You cool if I take my spot back?
00:23:33.746,00:23:34.955,Quite.
00:23:34.997,00:23:37.917,I was just here because I was hoping to get into Rachel's pants.
00:23:41.212,00:23:42.420,"We cool, dude?"
00:23:47.927,00:23:50.096,No.
00:23:52.098,00:23:54.432,Finn...
00:23:59.521,00:24:00.856,"Okay, this is all up to you now."
00:24:00.898,00:24:04.402,"You wanted the solo, you wanted the chance to be the star."
00:24:04.442,00:24:05.527,This is your chance.
00:24:05.569,00:24:07.529,Don't screw it up.
00:24:20.126,00:24:21.168,"WILL: Well, a-are they nervous?"
00:24:21.210,00:24:22.211,Has it started?
00:24:26.548,00:24:31.595,EMCEE: And now our final team-- McKinley High's New Directions!
00:27:27.729,00:27:31.358,"Ladies and gentlemen, The New Directions."
00:28:37.799,00:29:58.672,"MERCEDES: FINN &amp; RACHEL: MERCEDES: MERCEDES: Okay, I'm just going to come out and say it."
00:29:58.714,00:30:00.882,This is a singing competition.
00:30:00.924,00:30:03.385,I don't know how those deaf kids got in.
00:30:04.470,00:30:06.680,They weren't singing.
00:30:06.722,00:30:11.851,"They were, like, honking and everyone was crying and I was, like, Get off the stage."
00:30:11.893,00:30:14.313,You're terrible and you're making me super uncomfortable.
00:30:14.354,00:30:16.856,"Now, hold on just a second, Candy."
00:30:19.901,00:30:29.244,"Those Haverhurst kids twice had me reaching for my handkerchief, and those Jane Addams girls had it going on in all the right places."
00:30:30.912,00:30:34.833,I have no idea what the hell I'm doing here.
00:30:36.710,00:30:38.754,I'm serious.
00:30:38.796,00:30:52.476,I don't understand what a glee club is and I have never even heard the term show choir until about three hours ago when my boss told me he had tickets to NASCAR and I had to fill in at this fool event.
00:31:06.657,00:31:11.704,"The McKinley group was good but didn't seem all that rehearsed, but I liked their energy."
00:31:11.745,00:31:14.914,"Well, I have to admit I have a soft spot for the Rolling Stones."
00:31:14.956,00:31:19.127,I was at Altamont Speedway in '69.
00:31:20.962,00:31:25.384,Can't get that image out of my noggin to this day.
00:31:25.425,00:31:30.389,I seriously don't know what either one of you are talking about.
00:31:30.430,00:31:31.849,I have never been so bored.
00:31:31.890,00:31:35.811,"I mean, if I had to pick a group that I hated the least..."
00:31:37.688,00:31:39.939,"It doesn't sound good, guys."
00:31:40.982,00:31:44.403,"Hey, um..."
00:31:44.444,00:31:47.989,"I just wanted to say how great you all were, and I thought you were amazing."
00:31:48.031,00:31:50.116,We have nothing to say to you.
00:31:50.158,00:31:52.118,"Because we cheated, I know."
00:31:52.160,00:31:57.791,"I feel terrible about it, but I'm going to tell the judges right now that we don't deserve to win."
00:32:00.836,00:32:02.713,And your e-mail addresses?
00:32:04.005,00:32:06.842,You guys were so much fun to watch.
00:32:06.884,00:32:08.552,You should be very proud.
00:32:08.594,00:32:11.971,Get me the hell out of here.
00:32:12.013,00:32:15.851,"Um, excuse me, um, I have something I need to tell you."
00:32:15.893,00:32:19.521,"I'm sorry, we've made our decision."
00:32:33.243,00:32:34.912,Hi.
00:32:34.953,00:32:37.163,I thought you worked on Saturday afternoon.
00:32:37.205,00:32:38.998,"Yeah, I came home early."
00:32:39.040,00:32:40.292,I'm tired.
00:32:42.210,00:32:44.504,I haven't been sleeping very well.
00:32:46.214,00:32:48.049,What's with the monkey suit?
00:32:48.091,00:32:51.010,Ken and Emma's wedding-- it's at 4:00.
00:32:51.052,00:32:52.763,"Oh, yeah."
00:32:55.056,00:32:56.642,Here.
00:32:56.683,00:32:57.768,"Oh, I'm fine."
00:33:01.688,00:33:04.065,I want you to know I've been seeing a therapist.
00:33:04.107,00:33:08.069,"Oh, it's just at the local community center, but still."
00:33:08.111,00:33:11.615,Good.
00:33:11.657,00:33:13.325,I hope it works out for you.
00:33:14.785,00:33:16.328,"I'm taking responsibility, Will."
00:33:16.369,00:33:23.460,"I mean, I'm weak, and I'm selfish, and I let my anxiety rule my life, but you know I wasn't always that way."
00:33:23.502,00:33:31.343,It's just that... I wanted so many things that I know we're never going to have.
00:33:32.803,00:33:35.931,But that was okay as long as I still had you.
00:33:40.602,00:33:42.729,Say something?
00:33:44.773,00:33:48.777,"I'm looking at you, and I'm trying."
00:33:49.945,00:33:56.034,"I mean, I really want to feel that thing I always felt when I looked at you before."
00:33:57.744,00:34:01.999,"That feeling of family, of love."
00:34:04.417,00:34:05.878,But it's gone.
00:34:05.919,00:34:08.797,Forever?
00:34:08.839,00:34:11.842,I don't know.
00:34:35.156,00:34:37.492,Hey.
00:34:37.534,00:34:40.453,Nice ice sculpture.
00:34:42.372,00:34:44.457,Where's Ken?
00:34:46.001,00:34:53.967,"Um, home, I'd imagine, probably trying to regain some of the pride that I stole from him."
00:34:56.094,00:34:57.763,He dumped me.
00:34:57.804,00:34:59.723,What?
00:34:59.765,00:35:02.392,He said moving the wedding for Sectionals was the last straw.
00:35:03.435,00:35:07.731,But I thought he understood that-that you were doing this for the kids.
00:35:07.773,00:35:10.776,He understand that...
00:35:12.485,00:35:14.821,...I wasn't doing it for the kids.
00:35:17.198,00:35:19.618,I was doing it for you.
00:35:24.205,00:35:26.165,Emma...
00:35:26.207,00:35:28.418,I'm so sorry.
00:35:28.460,00:35:31.212,"No. Gosh, no, it's not your fault."
00:35:31.254,00:35:33.256,I-I really messed up.
00:35:34.633,00:35:36.175,He was absolutely right.
00:35:36.217,00:35:38.261,I was settling for him.
00:35:38.303,00:35:42.891,"Really, one blink from you, Will, and I would have been out the door."
00:35:47.604,00:35:49.606,"So, um..."
00:35:49.648,00:35:53.819,I e-mailed my resignation to Figgins.
00:35:53.860,00:35:56.071,I...
00:35:56.113,00:35:58.156,My last day is Monday.
00:36:00.241,00:36:02.828,I just can't...
00:36:02.869,00:36:04.704,I just can't be at that school.
00:36:19.094,00:36:21.763,I just left my wife.
00:36:28.478,00:36:30.396,"I'm sorry. I, um..."
00:36:30.438,00:36:32.524,I'm going.
00:36:35.360,00:36:37.236,But I just...
00:36:37.278,00:36:39.405,Just left your wife.
00:36:39.447,00:36:40.907,Exactly.
00:36:40.949,00:36:43.076,You just did.
00:36:49.290,00:36:51.209,You make a beautiful bride.
00:36:53.211,00:36:55.547,Thank you.
00:37:17.944,00:37:26.703,"Sue, the directors, both from the Jane Addams Academy and Haverbrook School for the Deaf, have informed me that you gave them The New Directions' set list."
00:37:26.745,00:37:28.955,You have no proof.
00:37:28.997,00:37:31.791,The set lists were on Cheerios' letterhead.
00:37:31.833,00:37:32.792,I didn't do it.
00:37:32.834,00:37:34.920,"They say, From the desk of Sue Sylvester."
00:37:34.961,00:37:37.172,Circumstantial evidence.
00:37:37.214,00:37:38.297,They're written in your handwriting!
00:37:38.339,00:37:39.758,Forgeries.
00:37:39.799,00:37:42.301,"Sue, there is an orgy of evidence stacked against you!"
00:37:42.343,00:37:45.764,"Well, you've clearly made up your mind not to be impartial in this case."
00:37:45.805,00:37:52.520,"So let's see if you can't wrap up this little lecture, slap me on the wrist, and let me get back to whipping my squad of champions into shape."
00:37:52.562,00:37:55.690,We have to be in Albuquerque in a couple of weeks for Nationals.
00:37:55.732,00:37:57.817,Sue!
00:37:57.859,00:38:00.028,Sit down!
00:38:03.823,00:38:08.036,"Sue, as of today, you are no longer coach of the Cheerios."
00:38:08.078,00:38:09.328,I beg your pardon?
00:38:09.370,00:38:13.332,"As of today, you are no longer coach of the Cheerios."
00:38:13.374,00:38:14.834,I beg your pardon!
00:38:18.255,00:38:21.633,"All this time, I thought Mr."
00:38:21.674,00:38:25.428,"And frankly, I was too willing to look past your monkeyshines because you kept winning."
00:38:27.388,00:38:30.976,You have embarrassed yourself and besmirched the name of William McKinley.
00:38:31.017,00:38:32.435,A failed president.
00:38:32.477,00:38:33.812,"Oh, please!"
00:38:33.853,00:38:35.396,The greatest one who ever lived!
00:38:35.438,00:38:38.357,You are suspended from this school as of today.
00:38:39.859,00:38:41.861,"Shue, you have anything to add?"
00:38:47.700,00:38:49.119,Let it be written.
00:38:51.121,00:38:54.833,"Okay, if this is the way you want to play it."
00:38:54.874,00:38:56.876,Okay.
00:39:01.798,00:39:07.053,"Shue, in light of Sue's interference, I am reinstating you as coach of the glee club."
00:39:07.095,00:39:12.558,I contacted the Ohio Show Choir Governing Board and set the record straight.
00:39:12.600,00:39:14.477,"Thank you, sir."
00:39:14.519,00:39:17.272,My pleasure.
00:39:17.314,00:39:19.024,All right.
00:39:27.324,00:39:30.285,Schuester?
00:39:36.499,00:39:38.543,"Well played, sir."
00:39:39.836,00:39:41.671,I underestimated you.
00:39:50.638,00:39:55.018,Then I'm gonna return to this school even more hell-bent on your destruction.
00:39:55.060,00:39:58.021,"Get ready for the ride of your life, Will Schuester."
00:39:58.063,00:40:00.648,You are about to board the Sue Sylvester Express.
00:40:00.690,00:40:03.735,Destination? Horror!
00:40:03.776,00:40:05.862,"I look forward to it, Sue."
00:40:05.904,00:40:09.532,You know you just woke a sleeping giant.
00:40:09.574,00:40:11.576,Prepared to be crushed.
00:40:20.001,00:40:21.753,Hmm.
00:40:21.794,00:40:25.090,"Well, we have a few things we'd like to show you, Mr. Shue."
00:40:26.966,00:40:29.094,The first...
00:40:33.973,00:40:35.808,Wow!
00:40:37.518,00:40:40.397,Yeah!
00:40:40.438,00:40:44.483,I am so proud of you guys.
00:40:51.824,00:40:54.411,So... congratulations.
00:40:54.452,00:40:55.912,You earned this.
00:40:55.954,00:40:57.747,Yeah!
00:40:57.789,00:41:01.209,Give it up!
00:41:01.251,00:41:03.461,But...
00:41:04.796,00:41:08.507,...now we have Regionals to worry about.
00:41:08.549,00:41:11.510,"And you can bet that Vocal Adrenaline is hard at work, so we should be, too."
00:41:11.552,00:41:14.013,"So, let's get started."
00:41:15.056,00:41:16.975,There's one more thing.
00:41:17.016,00:41:22.814,"Since you weren't able to be there to see us perform, we put together a special number just for you."
00:43:37.949,00:43:39.451,What?
00:00:07.090,00:00:08.425,...but then they got kind of good.
00:00:10.761,00:00:12.053,I'm done with you!
00:00:10.761,00:00:14.640,"And Will's wife Terri said she was pregnant, but she was just scared that Will liked Emma."
00:00:14.682,00:00:16.350,I just left my wife.
00:00:16.391,00:00:18.059,"I want you to be happy, Finn."
00:00:18.101,00:00:25.400,"Rachel loves that she and Finn are the glee club's new power couple, but he seems a little weird about it, and Sue tried to throw Sectionals but they won anyway, which is pretty exciting."
00:00:25.442,00:00:26.944,This is a travesty of international proportions.
00:00:26.986,00:00:28.487,That's what you missed on Glee.
00:00:40.123,00:00:41.375,"Feeling good, Mercedes."
00:00:41.416,00:00:42.793,This is amazing.
00:00:42.835,00:00:45.796,"Ever since Glee Club won Sectionals, everybody looks at us differently."
00:00:45.838,00:00:47.589,"I want to be with you, Rachel."
00:00:47.631,00:00:48.924,We're glitterati.
00:00:48.966,00:00:50.091,I feel like Lady Gaga.
00:00:50.133,00:00:52.093,"Get used to it, guys."
00:00:52.135,00:00:54.137,On par with all the jocks and popular kids.
00:00:54.179,00:00:58.392,"Oh, it's the dawn of a new era here at McKinley, and we are gonna rule this school!"
00:01:00.435,00:01:01.770,"Ooh-hoo, welcome to loser town."
00:01:01.812,00:01:03.146,Population: You.
00:01:04.648,00:01:05.566,I don't understand.
00:01:05.607,00:01:07.192,We won Sectionals.
00:01:07.234,00:01:09.486,I completely demonstrated the validity of this program.
00:01:09.528,00:01:12.573,Now you're saying we have to place at Regionals or the glee club's gone?
00:01:12.614,00:01:15.367,"Shue, that was the deal from the beginning."
00:01:15.409,00:01:17.036,I still have a bottom line.
00:01:17.077,00:01:20.163,Those spotlights in the auditorium don't run on dreams.
00:01:20.205,00:01:23.000,Our electricity consumption is up two percent.
00:01:23.042,00:01:28.213,"Besides, it's cold out, Shue, and the Cheerios can no longer practice out of doors!"
00:01:30.173,00:01:32.133,But the Cheerios don't even have a coach.
00:01:34.177,00:01:36.346,"Hey, buddy, you get a haircut?"
00:01:36.388,00:01:37.639,Looks awful.
00:01:41.769,00:01:44.605,I took the liberty of making it a double whip.
00:01:44.646,00:01:52.988,"Because after our conciliatory dinner, I happen to know that there is nothing you won't eat whipped cream off of."
00:01:55.198,00:01:58.619,"Would have gotten you one, Will, but, uh, I don't like you."
00:02:00.037,00:02:01.914,Okay.
00:02:03.206,00:02:05.876,"Wait, what the hell is going on here?"
00:02:05.918,00:02:08.963,You suspended her after she leaked our set list at Sectionals.
00:02:09.004,00:02:13.174,"Yes, and the point of suspension is reinstatement."
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.446,"So, I'm hoping basketball can be a fresh start."
00:02:39.242,00:02:42.121,"The fact is, I'm kind of depressed."
00:02:43.288,00:02:44.665,"Hey, Finn."
00:02:46.917,00:02:51.505,"That way, we always know what the other is up to, so you can't say you forgot we had plans when you miss our dates anymore."
00:02:51.546,00:02:53.214,"Great, but I'm kind of allergic to cats, so..."
00:02:53.256,00:02:56.135,I filled in all of our dates for the next month.
00:02:59.262,00:03:04.852,"FINN: I know I saved Glee Club, and I guess chicks dig me, but I guess if I'm being honest, it's more like I'm not over her."
00:03:04.893,00:03:06.311,PUCK: I'm not breaking up with you.
00:03:06.353,00:03:10.231,"I'm just saying, please stop super-sizing, 'cause... I don't dig on fat chicks."
00:03:11.274,00:03:12.151,And that's my fault?
00:03:12.191,00:03:17.948,"FINN: And Rachel-- now that we're sort of dating, I have to work so much harder to pretend to be listening to her."
00:03:20.534,00:03:23.162,Sometimes I wish I could be more like Coach Tanaka.
00:03:23.202,00:03:24.830,He pulled a Jessica Simpson.
00:03:24.872,00:03:29.168,"You know, lost his fiancÃ©e, gained 40 pounds and stopped showering."
00:03:29.208,00:03:31.210,And everyone acts like it's totally normal.
00:03:36.925,00:03:39.469,That's my boyfriend!
00:03:41.304,00:03:49.897,"I'm off my game, and I don't know how to get back on it."
00:03:59.322,00:04:02.450,I'm going to donate of Hurricane Katrina.
00:04:06.246,00:04:07.455,Sue.
00:04:16.548,00:04:22.096,"Riddled with remorse, I arranged a dinner so Figgins and I could have a little professional sit-down."
00:04:22.137,00:04:24.806,"Sue, there's no way I'm letting you back into that school."
00:04:24.848,00:04:26.141,Mind flagging down that waiter?
00:04:28.351,00:04:31.188,We had a very frank and healing discussion.
00:04:31.230,00:04:32.397,"And you know what, Will?"
00:04:32.439,00:04:37.903,It was like he was seeing me and my moral integrity for the very first time.
00:04:43.200,00:04:44.534,So here's what's going to happen.
00:04:46.995,00:04:53.168,Or I will tell your wife and the entire congregation of the Cornerstone Bible Way Church of our sexual congress.
00:04:55.295,00:04:56.797,Smile.
00:05:03.386,00:05:07.266,"I won't be burying any hatchets, William, unless I happen to get a clear shot to your groin."
00:05:11.103,00:05:13.021,All I did was enjoy watching it happen.
00:05:13.063,00:05:14.273,"Yeah, well, enjoy this, William."
00:05:14.314,00:05:21.404,"Now that I am back and my position is secured, I will not stop until you are fired, and your little glee club is annihilated into oblivion."
00:05:21.446,00:05:23.198,Bring it.
00:05:23.240,00:05:24.616,"Oh, I will bring it, William."
00:05:24.658,00:05:26.367,You know what else I'm gonna bring?
00:05:26.409,00:05:28.954,I'm going to bring some Asian cookery to rub your head with.
00:05:28.996,00:05:32.916,'Cause right now you got enough product in your hair to season a wok.
00:05:43.302,00:05:44.928,Hello.
00:05:45.887,00:05:48.182,Hello?
00:05:50.433,00:05:50.851,What up?
00:05:50.892,00:05:51.893,Who this be?
00:05:51.935,00:05:53.394,"No, she's dead."
00:05:53.436,00:05:54.980,O-kay...
00:05:55.022,00:05:59.693,"Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, liked to say Ahoy, ahoy when he answered the phone."
00:05:59.734,00:06:04.823,It was Edison who decided that hello was a more appropriate greeting.
00:06:04.865,00:06:14.333,"Look, I am really proud of what you guys did at Sectionals, but as most of you have realized by now, it hasn't made a bit of difference in your day-to-day at school."
00:06:16.459,00:06:20.255,"The fact is, we're gonna have to be better, even more spectacular, at Regionals."
00:06:20.297,00:06:24.425,"It's time for some reinvention, some new New Directions."
00:06:24.467,00:06:26.803,We need a new...
00:06:26.845,00:06:28.347,hello.
00:06:30.473,00:06:35.103,"Come up with a fresh number, but it has to have hello in the song title, all right?"
00:06:42.110,00:06:44.445,Hi.
00:06:44.487,00:06:46.489,Hi.
00:06:46.531,00:06:49.743,"This is kind of weird, isn't it?"
00:06:49.784,00:06:51.245,Yes.
00:06:51.286,00:06:52.829,"I mean, here we are."
00:06:52.871,00:06:55.790,We've been in this exact situation a hundred times.
00:06:57.376,00:07:01.420,"Only this time, I could just lean over and kiss you if I want to."
00:07:05.508,00:07:06.718,"No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on."
00:07:11.514,00:07:12.849,Just hold on.
00:07:18.563,00:07:20.481,It was like a...
00:07:22.025,00:07:24.485,"I'm sorry, this is a completely unattractive quality."
00:07:24.527,00:07:27.239,You are adorable.
00:07:30.533,00:07:34.121,We need to clean up a little before we charge forward.
00:07:34.162,00:07:35.663,Get the monkeys off our backs.
00:07:35.705,00:07:37.498,Let's do this right.
00:07:37.540,00:07:38.499,We should go on a date.
00:07:38.541,00:07:41.295,Okay.
00:07:41.336,00:07:44.339,"new people, not tied down by anyone."
00:07:44.381,00:07:45.506,My place.
00:07:47.384,00:07:49.510,I didn't know you could cook.
00:07:49.552,00:07:53.514,There are so many things you don't know about me.
00:07:53.556,00:07:57.477,And I can't wait to introduce them all to you.
00:07:58.728,00:08:00.730,I'll see you later.
00:08:09.864,00:08:13.827,"Glee Club won Sectionals, and you did nothing to stop it."
00:08:13.868,00:08:21.793,"If you were samurai, and my letter opener were sharp enough, I would ask you both right now to commit seppuku."
00:08:21.835,00:08:24.545,"In Japanese, this means ritual belly-slitting."
00:08:24.587,00:08:27.341,We were seduced by the glitz and glamour of show biz.
00:08:27.382,00:08:30.385,Let me drop some knowledge on you.
00:08:34.973,00:08:41.229,"If you want the job and back in my good graces, you're gonna have to turn around and listen up."
00:08:48.611,00:08:52.282,And what she really wants is one Finn Hudson.
00:08:52.324,00:08:53.741,I want you to go after him.
00:08:53.783,00:08:55.243,She'll go crazy.
00:08:55.285,00:08:56.786,She won't be able to stand your dating him.
00:08:56.828,00:09:01.791,"Humiliated, shamed, she'll have no choice but to leave the group."
00:09:01.833,00:09:06.087,"And without her, Schuester won't make it to Regionals."
00:09:07.422,00:09:10.175,I know it's been hard on you since the baby drama.
00:09:10.217,00:09:12.177,"Trust me, I get it, and it sucks."
00:09:12.219,00:09:13.761,You seem to be handling it fine.
00:09:13.803,00:09:19.976,"Well, it's because I realized that I had to find this new person inside of me, the one that was okay with what happened."
00:09:23.063,00:09:28.193,"Finn, that guy who made all those bad choices, who ignored the signs, he's gone."
00:09:28.235,00:09:32.197,"This new, more experienced, more interesting guy is here."
00:09:32.239,00:09:34.615,And I brought you here to introduce you to him.
00:09:34.657,00:09:36.117,Help you move forward.
00:09:36.159,00:09:37.702,"Oh, you mean like, meeting other girls?"
00:09:37.744,00:09:39.246,Because I think I'm dating Rachel.
00:09:39.287,00:09:41.540,At least she sure thinks I am.
00:09:41.581,00:09:43.417,"No, it's not about meeting someone else."
00:09:43.458,00:09:45.668,It's about being okay just being you.
00:09:45.710,00:09:48.422,"Come on, you're a rock star, Finn."
00:09:48.463,00:09:49.714,"You're like Jagger, Morrison."
00:09:49.756,00:09:51.216,"Yeah, yeah, I like that."
00:09:51.258,00:09:57.055,Good. I want you to meet the new and improved Finn Hudson by singing about it.
00:10:04.687,00:10:06.731,And the Doors have a hello song.
00:10:06.773,00:10:10.902,So maybe I could find myself and do my Glee assignment at the same time.
00:11:50.377,00:11:54.047,"And that, fellow glee clubbers, is how we say hello."
00:11:55.798,00:12:00.387,"Mr. Schuester, I'd like to run some of my hello ideas by you."
00:12:09.812,00:12:10.813,You're a really good dancer.
00:12:16.277,00:12:18.279,Brit and I were wondering if you wanted to go out.
00:12:18.321,00:12:20.240,On a... date?
00:12:20.281,00:12:22.534,With which one of you?
00:12:24.244,00:12:25.870,With both of us.
00:12:35.838,00:12:38.258,"Breadstix, 8:00."
00:12:38.299,00:12:39.509,Table for three?
00:12:39.551,00:12:41.010,Cool.
00:12:46.224,00:12:47.601,What did they want?
00:12:47.642,00:12:48.685,"Oh, nothing."
00:12:48.727,00:12:50.769,Just the time.
00:12:53.648,00:12:56.317,I know being my boyfriend is a challenge.
00:12:56.359,00:12:57.860,I'm not Quinn.
00:12:59.153,00:13:05.326,"I'm not popular, and my personality, though exciting and full of surprises, isn't exactly low-maintenance, but..."
00:13:07.870,00:13:09.830,I'll always be honest with you.
00:13:09.872,00:13:11.416,Painfully so.
00:13:11.458,00:13:14.711,And all I ask in return is that you're just honest with me.
00:13:17.547,00:13:19.340,I don't think I want to be your boyfriend.
00:13:31.561,00:13:33.563,I need to find out who I am now.
00:13:35.940,00:13:38.443,I'll tell you who you are.
00:13:40.361,00:13:46.867,"You're afraid of dating me because you think it might hurt your reputation-- though, which you'd never admit it, is very important to you."
00:13:46.909,00:13:50.455,"You hate what Quinn did to you, not just because it hurt, but because it was so humiliating."
00:13:50.497,00:13:51.456,You're freaking me out.
00:13:51.498,00:13:53.040,It's like you're inside my head right now.
00:13:53.082,00:13:54.875,I just see you for who you are.
00:13:54.917,00:14:01.341,"Unlike you, who can only see me as this silly girl who made a fool out of herself in her first glee club rehearsal."
00:14:01.382,00:14:03.384,"And that's where you lose, Finn."
00:14:03.426,00:14:14.354,"Because, if you take a second look at me, you'd realize that I'm the only person in your life who knows you and accepts you for who you are, no matter what."
00:14:20.652,00:14:24.531,"FINN: Well, obviously, Hawaiian pizza's the best because it's got ham and pineapple on it, right?"
00:14:24.572,00:14:25.906,True.
00:14:25.948,00:14:28.201,"So, it's better than most pizzas because it has..."
00:14:28.242,00:14:32.163,"WILL: All right, guys, you got to get moving on those hello numbers."
00:14:32.205,00:14:34.123,Who has got something to show us?
00:14:34.165,00:14:35.249,Volunteers?
00:14:36.459,00:14:41.214,"Mr. Schuester, I think I found a song that sums up my feelings perfectly."
00:14:42.965,00:14:44.718,Show us what you got.
00:16:12.472,00:17:02.939,"ALL: WILL: Guys, guys, guys."
00:17:02.981,00:17:07.151,"I don't want to be a buzz-kill, but the assignment was hello."
00:17:07.193,00:17:10.530,I'm sorry. I was just focusing on the first syllable.
00:17:10.571,00:17:12.448,WILL: You know what?
00:17:12.490,00:17:15.451,I don't think you guys understand the seriousness of what we're up against.
00:17:15.493,00:17:19.914,"While we were busy winning our Sectional, Vocal Adrenaline was busy winning theirs."
00:17:19.956,00:17:22.082,They're last year's national champions.
00:17:22.124,00:17:24.878,They haven't lost a competition in three years.
00:17:24.919,00:17:28.339,"This is the big leagues, guys."
00:17:28.381,00:17:32.719,"If we don't place at Regionals, Glee Club is over."
00:17:59.370,00:18:00.830,One of my favorites.
00:18:03.374,00:18:05.001,You're in Vocal Adrenaline.
00:18:05.043,00:18:06.293,And you're Rachel Berry.
00:18:06.335,00:18:08.838,I saw you perform at Sectionals.
00:18:11.841,00:18:13.843,You totally lacked Barbra's emotional depth.
00:18:15.177,00:18:17.221,But you're talented.
00:18:17.263,00:18:19.557,This is one of my favorite haunts.
00:18:19.599,00:18:22.602,I like to come and flip through the celebrity biographies.
00:18:22.643,00:18:24.645,Pick up some lifestyle tips.
00:18:24.687,00:18:28.441,"I'm a senior now, so this year's kind of my victory lap."
00:18:28.482,00:18:31.736,Snagging a fourth consecutive national championship would just be gravy.
00:18:31.778,00:18:34.864,I'm getting out of Ohio soon.
00:18:34.906,00:18:39.159,I've got a full ride to a little school called the University of California Los Angeles.
00:18:39.201,00:18:40.870,Maybe you've heard of it.
00:18:40.912,00:18:42.622,It's in Los Angeles.
00:18:46.626,00:18:48.962,What do you say we take it for a spin?
00:18:49.003,00:18:51.213,Here?
00:18:54.425,00:18:57.095,I remember when I used to get nervous.
00:18:57.136,00:18:59.179,Come on. I do this all the time.
00:18:59.221,00:19:01.599,I like to give impromptu concerts for the homeless.
00:19:01.641,00:19:04.102,It's so important to give back.
00:19:44.350,00:21:39.423,BOTH: BOTH: We should do this more often.
00:21:40.466,00:21:41.968,How's Friday night?
00:21:49.100,00:21:50.476,Excuse me.
00:21:51.477,00:21:53.353,We'd like to send these back.
00:21:53.395,00:21:54.647,But you ate all of it.
00:21:57.399,00:21:59.652,And this food was not satisfactory.
00:21:59.693,00:22:01.445,There was a mouse in mine.
00:22:01.487,00:22:03.405,"So, we'd like more, please."
00:22:06.450,00:22:08.869,"All right, hottest guys in the school."
00:22:08.911,00:22:09.829,Go.
00:22:09.870,00:22:12.414,"Okay, um, Puck's super-fine."
00:22:12.456,00:22:13.833,Mm-hmm.
00:22:13.874,00:22:15.626,"Yeah, but he's not hot, though."
00:22:15.668,00:22:17.044,He really isn't.
00:22:18.420,00:22:21.257,I think that dwarf girlfriend of his is dragging down his rep.
00:22:21.299,00:22:26.887,"I mean, if he were dating, say, popular pretty girls like us, he would go from dumpy to smokin'."
00:22:27.930,00:22:29.473,"Hey, I'm right here."
00:22:29.515,00:22:33.186,"Would you guys mind, like, including me in your conversations?"
00:22:33.227,00:22:35.813,I'll just give you an introduction into the way that we work.
00:22:38.649,00:22:40.193,It's like the best deal ever.
00:22:40.234,00:22:42.402,Did you see what Rachel was wearing today?
00:22:43.445,00:22:46.406,"She looked like Pippi Longstocking, but, like, Israeli."
00:22:46.448,00:22:48.284,Those sweaters make her look homeschooled.
00:22:49.660,00:22:50.786,"Hey, guys, come on."
00:22:50.828,00:22:52.872,She's... she's kind of cool.
00:22:52.913,00:22:54.414,"Finn, that's mean."
00:22:54.456,00:22:56.250,"You know what, actually?"
00:22:54.456,00:22:57.375,Would you mind waiting in the car?
00:22:58.460,00:22:59.628,And leave your credit card.
00:23:03.465,00:23:06.719,Did you know that dolphins are just gay sharks?
00:23:08.095,00:23:10.097,Yeah.
00:23:17.479,00:23:52.890,NEIL DIAMOND: This is the perfect song for us.
00:23:52.932,00:24:00.773,"See, he's known this girl for so long, but they've just been friends, and now he's calling her up to tell her he wants more."
00:24:06.528,00:24:07.487,"Well, I love it."
00:24:07.529,00:24:08.530,Yeah?
00:24:08.572,00:24:11.367,You do?
00:24:12.534,00:24:15.162,"I don't know why, but..."
00:24:15.204,00:24:18.291,I always had a soft spot for this song.
00:24:45.192,00:24:46.610,Too much too fast.
00:24:46.652,00:24:48.321,"You smell great, your teeth are clean..."
00:24:50.572,00:24:58.289,"I just haven't been, uh... intimate in a very, very long time."
00:25:03.961,00:25:05.796,Ever.
00:25:09.425,00:25:13.553,I just haven't found the right person.
00:25:13.595,00:25:20.269,"You know, someone who won't reject me when things get really hard with my, um, with my problems."
00:25:22.229,00:25:24.190,It-It's cool.
00:25:25.607,00:25:27.485,It's not cool.
00:25:27.525,00:25:28.568,"No, no, no."
00:25:28.610,00:25:30.070,Emma...
00:25:31.613,00:25:33.073,I understand.
00:25:34.616,00:25:37.161,I'll pop in a movie.
00:25:37.203,00:25:39.579,Do we have to watch Armageddon again?
00:25:39.621,00:25:42.833,"Uh, it's that or Bad Boys."
00:25:42.875,00:25:45.002,They're the only DVDs that Terri left behind.
00:25:56.472,00:25:58.682,"FINN: Hey, Rach, can we talk?"
00:25:58.724,00:26:01.601,"Look, I want to apologize."
00:26:01.643,00:26:03.770,I realized I don't want to date other girls.
00:26:03.812,00:26:05.064,Only you.
00:26:05.105,00:26:11.195,"You do talk too much, and usually you're just talking about yourself, but at least I don't feel alone when I'm with you."
00:26:11.237,00:26:14.281,"I'm glad you've come to that realization, but you're too late."
00:26:14.323,00:26:18.494,I've met someone else-- a boy who's finally worthy of my talent and love.
00:26:18.536,00:26:20.496,"Whoa, whoa, wait."
00:26:21.663,00:26:23.249,"Is he, is he bigger than me?"
00:26:25.667,00:26:27.503,"His name is Jessie, and he's the male lead in Vocal Adrenaline."
00:26:33.675,00:26:35.094,"Rachel, don't you think that's kind of suspicious?"
00:26:38.680,00:26:44.311,"I know it's hard to believe that anyone would like me without an ulterior motive, but you have to respect that our love is real."
00:26:44.353,00:26:45.938,"Move on, Finn."
00:26:45.979,00:26:47.647,I finally have.
00:26:53.695,00:26:55.114,Mr. Shue...
00:26:57.283,00:26:58.492,...we have a problem.
00:27:05.082,00:27:06.959,Such as?
00:27:05.082,00:27:10.754,"I didn't wear a bra, and I had them turn up the air conditioning."
00:27:13.715,00:27:16.594,You may be two of the stupidest teens I've ever encountered.
00:27:16.634,00:27:18.387,And that's saying something.
00:27:18.429,00:27:21.265,I once taught a cheerleading seminar to a young Sarah Palin.
00:27:21.307,00:27:25.144,"Wait, we did find out Rachel's with some dude from Vocal Adrenaline."
00:27:26.728,00:27:28.355,Jessie St. James.
00:27:28.397,00:27:32.859,"Ooh, bringing down this club may be easier than I thought."
00:27:32.901,00:27:36.572,I'm engorged with venom and triumph.
00:27:37.615,00:27:40.700,Now get the hell out of my office.
00:28:32.670,00:28:35.755,"Seriously, guys, it's like watching beige paint dry."
00:28:35.797,00:28:36.882,Could everyone please look at Jessie?
00:28:37.799,00:28:39.635,"Jessie, give us a show face."
00:28:40.802,00:28:41.637,"That's a show face, guys."
00:28:41.679,00:28:45.057,"You want to look so talented, it's literally hurting you."
00:28:45.098,00:28:47.851,"I want a look that's so optimistic, it could cure cancer."
00:28:49.853,00:28:51.146,That's what I'm talking about.
00:28:51.188,00:28:52.772,"Take five, everybody."
00:28:56.485,00:28:58.028,"Excuse me, Ms. Corcoran?"
00:28:58.070,00:28:59.071,"Hi, I'm Will Schuester."
00:28:59.112,00:29:00.989,"Sorry, I don't know who you are."
00:29:01.031,00:29:03.950,"I'm a big fan, really."
00:29:03.992,00:29:05.785,I also coach the McKinley Glee Club.
00:29:05.827,00:29:09.206,I don't usually cotton too well to my competition sneaking in to watch a rehearsal.
00:29:09.248,00:29:12.292,But I also have trouble seeing you guys as competition.
00:29:12.334,00:29:15.713,I believe you have a student named Jessie St. James?
00:29:15.754,00:29:18.424,"Yeah, I think he might be dating one of my students."
00:29:18.465,00:29:23.679,I'm more than a little concerned with the whole fraternizing with the enemy aspect of their relationship.
00:29:23.721,00:29:25.055,You think we're spying on you?
00:29:25.097,00:29:26.848,Honestly?
00:29:26.890,00:29:28.183,Yes.
00:29:28.225,00:29:30.603,Noted.
00:29:30.644,00:29:33.731,"Look, I don't stand for any funny business, and Jessie's a good kid."
00:29:33.772,00:29:34.856,"I mean, what can you do?"
00:29:34.898,00:29:38.818,The heart wants what the heart wants.
00:29:49.705,00:29:53.626,I'm not interested in coaching just your average high school glee club.
00:29:54.876,00:29:56.002,"Yeah, excellence."
00:29:56.044,00:30:01.341,A lot of people thought I couldn't take Nationals with a routine where the kids dance entirely on their hands.
00:30:03.552,00:30:06.054,Okay... I'm sorry.
00:30:06.930,00:30:07.889,We have to stop.
00:30:07.931,00:30:09.057,I...
00:30:14.354,00:30:15.731,I'm all business; I'm trying to work on that.
00:30:17.899,00:30:18.942,Are you gay?
00:30:18.984,00:30:20.653,What?
00:30:20.694,00:30:21.654,No.
00:30:21.695,00:30:24.615,Because most of the show choir directors I make out with are gay.
00:30:28.410,00:30:32.498,I spend every waking moment thinking about Vocal Adrenaline.
00:30:32.539,00:30:33.791,I have no life.
00:30:33.832,00:30:35.542,I haven't been on a date in three years.
00:30:35.584,00:30:36.752,Here you go.
00:30:36.794,00:30:37.711,Thanks.
00:30:37.753,00:30:40.380,I did lie to you earlier.
00:30:40.422,00:30:41.548,I do know who you are.
00:30:41.590,00:30:43.801,I saw you at our fall invitational.
00:30:46.928,00:30:50.182,"You know, I know what you mean-- about being obsessed with work."
00:30:54.936,00:30:57.147,How long have you been divorced?
00:30:57.189,00:31:02.068,"Um... well, I'm not really divorced yet."
00:31:02.110,00:31:07.741,"And then I-I started dating someone I-I really care about, but it isn't working for some reason."
00:31:07.783,00:31:11.787,"Oh, you're already seeing someone else and you were just making out with me."
00:31:11.829,00:31:14.581,I'm kind of a mess.
00:31:14.623,00:31:16.500,"Look, I don't want to tell you how to live your life..."
00:31:16.542,00:31:18.502,"Please, be my guest."
00:31:18.544,00:31:22.715,I think you need to take some time to reintroduce yourself to yourself.
00:31:22.756,00:31:25.925,"You just finished being somebody's husband, and that didn't really work out."
00:31:28.970,00:31:31.223,Seems to me you need to take a little breather.
00:31:31.264,00:31:42.192,"Look, that hair, that dimple, that terrible clunker you drive-- I think you're about the cutest thing I've ever seen."
00:31:43.985,00:31:47.614,"When you get things sorted out, give me a call."
00:31:47.656,00:31:48.657,Thank you for the coffee.
00:31:48.699,00:31:53.203,And the making out-- kind of hot.
00:32:03.171,00:32:04.423,"Hey, guys."
00:32:04.464,00:32:06.007,"Cut the butter, Benedict Arnold."
00:32:07.050,00:32:08.594,We heard about your new boyfriend.
00:32:08.635,00:32:15.809,"Look, Rachel, we're all happy that you're happy, but we've worked too hard in Glee Club to let you throw it all away on a relationship that might not even be real."
00:32:15.851,00:32:17.895,"Why, 'cause he's in Vocal Adrenaline?"
00:32:17.936,00:32:20.773,Their motto is Aut neca aut necatus eris.
00:32:20.814,00:32:23.650,Which loosely translates to Murder or be murdered.
00:32:23.692,00:32:25.652,They give their dancers human growth hormone.
00:32:25.694,00:32:28.238,"Look, we're not saying the dude is playing you."
00:32:28.280,00:32:33.493,"We just think that until Regionals are over, we can't risk the possibility that he is."
00:32:36.037,00:32:41.627,"Okay, look, Jessie and I might not be true love, but what if we are?"
00:32:44.212,00:32:47.382,And how many chances at this am I going to get?
00:32:47.424,00:32:50.844,"If you don't break up with him, you're out."
00:32:50.886,00:32:52.846,You can't kick me out!
00:32:52.888,00:32:55.056,But we can all quit if Mr. Shue doesn't.
00:33:01.062,00:33:02.606,How could you do this to me?
00:33:05.066,00:33:10.823,"We're a team, and all you've ever wanted was for us to be great, and be a part of something special."
00:33:10.864,00:33:13.032,Now is that still true or not?
00:33:24.711,00:33:26.212,"I did, Rachel."
00:33:26.254,00:33:30.133,I want to introduce you to the McKinley High Old Maids Club.
00:33:37.349,00:33:39.476,"WOMAN: Have a seat, boy hips."
00:33:42.938,00:33:44.690,I don't understand.
00:33:44.731,00:33:50.362,"Well, Rachel, it's come to my attention that you've been given the old heave-ho by that terribly uncoordinated Finn Hudson."
00:33:50.403,00:33:52.113,Ouch.
00:33:50.403,00:34:04.918,"And I also understand you have a serious suitor in the form a piping hot hunkwad from another district, but that your fellow glee clubbers are so incensed with betrayal, they barely have time to apply Freeze Off to the clusters of warts between their knuckles."
00:34:04.960,00:34:06.586,How did you know that?
00:34:06.628,00:34:09.673,Brit and I told everybody in Glee Club about Jessie St. James.
00:34:09.715,00:34:11.090,They're furious.
00:34:13.134,00:34:14.135,Outstanding.
00:34:14.177,00:34:17.556,Round up a bunch of mustache-sporting teenage girls with glandular conditions.
00:34:17.597,00:34:18.807,Anything else?
00:34:18.849,00:34:20.976,Sometimes I forget my middle name.
00:34:21.018,00:34:23.102,"I know how torn you must be, Berry."
00:34:23.144,00:34:28.692,"My freshman year, I fell for a boy on an opposing wrestling squad, but my team wouldn't go for it."
00:34:28.734,00:34:37.116,"So, the next time I stepped onto the mat, I pinned him so hard, it ruptured his scrotum, ending his run for the state championship and my run for his heart."
00:34:43.164,00:34:48.545,"Now, I spend my Friday nights making out with my cat and watching Ghost Whisperer."
00:34:48.587,00:34:59.138,"SUE: Well, Rachel, if I weren't ignoring what these ladies were saying out of an overwhelming sense of deep repulsion, I would probably hear them encouraging you to go for it with your Carmel High beau."
00:34:59.180,00:35:08.189,"Or you might end up like Dottie here, who, although her father offered a sizeable dowry, which included livestock, still couldn't get a date to homecoming."
00:35:08.231,00:35:09.649,No homecoming?
00:35:09.691,00:35:12.569,"SUE: No Valentines, no sock hop."
00:35:12.611,00:35:17.866,"Rachel, you need to become even more narcissistic and self-centered than you already are."
00:35:17.908,00:35:20.869,Think of yourself-- your potential happiness.
00:35:20.911,00:35:25.123,"If not, join the club."
00:35:37.594,00:35:39.471,TERRI: Beautiful table.
00:35:39.512,00:35:41.139,"Meticulous, really."
00:35:42.307,00:35:44.684,I guess being crazy has its benefits.
00:35:52.525,00:35:55.612,And I know he keeps a key under the mat.
00:35:55.654,00:35:58.115,"You're really loving this, aren't you?"
00:36:01.159,00:36:04.287,"But I am enjoying seeing Will get a second chance at happiness, yes."
00:36:04.329,00:36:07.248,"Oh, and you're the one to introduce him to this magical new world of bliss?"
00:36:07.290,00:36:11.419,"What, you with your three-times-a-day showers and the fact that you can't sleep unless your shoes are all in a row?"
00:36:11.461,00:36:13.379,Is there a reason that you're here?
00:36:13.421,00:36:16.174,'Cause I'd kind of like you to be gone when Will gets home.
00:36:18.259,00:36:21.680,I just need to pick up the rest of my Bruckheimer DVDs.
00:36:32.315,00:36:34.233,Whose is this?
00:36:34.275,00:36:35.861,That's mine.
00:36:35.902,00:36:37.612,I got really tired of watching Con Air every night.
00:36:37.654,00:36:39.531,And Will picked Hello as our song.
00:36:39.572,00:36:41.783,"Oh, you poor girl."
00:36:43.785,00:36:45.745,Don't bother sleeping with my husband tonight.
00:36:45.787,00:36:47.246,You're already screwed.
00:36:47.288,00:36:48.874,Hello was our prom song.
00:36:50.542,00:36:52.085,"I mean, I doubt Will remembers."
00:36:52.127,00:36:55.254,"He goes to the market for milk, comes home with a pack of gum."
00:36:55.296,00:36:57.215,You're lying.
00:37:02.303,00:37:08.810,"Or better yet, go to the library and look it up for yourself in that year's Thunderclap."
00:37:21.907,00:37:24.242,Who's there?
00:37:27.204,00:37:28.914,I carry a rape whistle.
00:37:28.955,00:37:29.706,Just me.
00:37:31.249,00:37:33.752,"Most spots are 2,500 watts."
00:37:35.336,00:37:37.714,"We have to wear sunscreen onstage, but it's worth it."
00:37:41.718,00:37:45.471,I have to ask you something.
00:37:57.776,00:38:00.319,"Okay, okay, not literally, but emotionally."
00:38:06.451,00:38:08.745,"Oh, my God."
00:38:08.787,00:38:10.413,What?
00:38:10.455,00:38:13.041,You're more of a drama queen than I am.
00:38:16.878,00:38:18.838,Hi.
00:38:18.880,00:38:20.590,I'm Jessie.
00:38:20.632,00:38:22.717,I know who you are.
00:38:27.388,00:38:35.313,"I want to introduce you to Jessie, the guy who's nuts about you, the guy who would never hurt you."
00:38:45.615,00:38:47.826,No one can know.
00:38:48.868,00:38:50.912,I understand.
00:39:07.428,00:39:08.680,Hi.
00:39:08.721,00:39:11.599,Hey.
00:39:11.641,00:39:18.773,"I get home last night, and it was like some ghost had laid out this beautiful, romantic meal for me."
00:39:18.815,00:39:20.066,A ghost who wears your perfume.
00:39:20.108,00:39:21.860,I was just in the library.
00:39:22.861,00:39:25.030,Page 42.
00:39:26.072,00:39:27.699,Okay.
00:39:27.740,00:39:32.329,"Oh, my... my junior prom."
00:39:41.880,00:39:43.631,I wanted to surprise you on Wednesday.
00:39:43.673,00:39:49.470,"Terri came by and, um, told me about the prom..."
00:39:49.512,00:39:52.307,"Emma, I-I have no feelings about this night anymore."
00:39:52.349,00:39:53.850,I didn't even remember the song.
00:39:57.312,00:40:00.398,"But somewhere inside, you're still not over her."
00:40:02.275,00:40:04.069,We were naive.
00:40:04.110,00:40:09.282,I think sometimes we spend so much time with these kids that we start acting like them.
00:40:10.575,00:40:15.454,You've been in the same relationship your entire life.
00:40:15.496,00:40:17.874,You don't know who you are alone.
00:40:25.090,00:40:26.507,I'm a different person now.
00:40:26.549,00:40:33.348,How is you compromising yourself for my crazy any different than you doing it for hers?
00:40:44.901,00:40:48.321,Well... what do you want to do?
00:40:48.363,00:40:50.448,I think that...
00:40:51.741,00:40:53.826,...you need to spend some time alone.
00:40:55.536,00:40:58.206,I do. I think you need to get to know yourself.
00:40:58.248,00:41:01.918,"You know, you haven't been okay with having your own needs since you were 15."
00:41:13.554,00:41:15.514,I'm just not good at being alone...
00:41:15.556,00:41:18.851,and realizing what my own needs are.
00:41:20.979,00:41:24.107,"Well, maybe around the time that you figure out what they are..."
00:41:24.149,00:41:26.776,maybe I'll be ready to get a little messy.
00:41:30.571,00:41:32.740,Can you go now?
00:41:34.159,00:41:37.329,I think I need to close the door and cry.
00:42:07.066,00:42:09.194,Hey.
00:42:09.235,00:42:10.362,I ended it with Jessie.
00:42:10.403,00:42:11.570,You can spread the word.
00:42:11.612,00:42:13.281,I know you know how to do that.
00:42:13.323,00:42:15.574,"Look, I'm sorry, uh..."
00:42:15.616,00:42:19.954,"Look, I know this really sucks for you but I think it's for the best."
00:42:19.996,00:42:21.580,Taking one for the team.
00:42:21.622,00:42:23.375,"No, not just for the team."
00:42:23.416,00:42:24.959,For us.
00:42:25.001,00:42:26.585,You and me.
00:42:28.629,00:42:37.222,"I feel like I have all these problems, you know, with Quinn and-and basketball and girls and stuff, and I've been so overwhelmed trying to figure them all out."
00:42:37.263,00:42:40.433,Then I realized the only thing I needed to fix was us.
00:42:42.018,00:42:45.104,"I want us to be together, Rachel."
00:42:45.146,00:42:47.315,A real couple.
00:42:47.357,00:42:52.695,"Look, I even circled some dates on your crazy calendar."
00:42:52.737,00:42:57.616,Is you not being able to talk right now a good thing or a bad thing?
00:42:57.658,00:42:59.660,I can't.
00:42:59.702,00:43:03.706,I-I can't be a couple with you.
00:43:05.833,00:43:08.545,It's the team.
00:43:08.586,00:43:11.714,"We-We can't have any, um, drama right now."
00:43:11.756,00:43:14.133,"You know, we need... we need to focus on Regionals."
00:43:14.175,00:43:21.558,"And I appreciate your offer, but in the spirit of being a team player, I have to decline."
00:43:21.599,00:43:22.641,"Hey, whoa."
00:43:24.852,00:43:28.606,I'm not just some guy that you met at the music store that you can just blow off.
00:43:29.899,00:43:31.526,I don't give up that easy.
00:43:34.779,00:43:36.864,See you at rehearsal.
00:00:03.086,00:00:05.255,SUE: Madonna.
00:00:08.676,00:00:13.722,"Even in voice-over, how I have worshipped her ever since I was a little girl."
00:00:17.100,00:00:22.063,Madonna is the most powerful woman to ever walk the face of the Earth.
00:00:22.105,00:00:29.112,"I'm instating a new policy whereby we play Madonna'sGreatest Hits over the P.A. system, quite loudly, throughout the entire school day."
00:00:29.154,00:00:34.075,But blasting her delicious hooks would make it impossible for the students to concentrate.
00:00:36.119,00:00:40.499,She hopped a cab for the bright lights of New York City with 35 bucks in her pocket.
00:00:40.541,00:00:43.084,And I think we should encourage our pupils to do the same.
00:00:43.126,00:00:47.798,"You say the word, and I will provide you a list of the students I believe should be rounded up and shipped off immediately."
00:00:47.840,00:00:50.551,"I am sorry, Sue."
00:01:12.155,00:01:16.243,Do you not understand the blackmail process and how it works?
00:01:16.827,00:01:18.746,Smile.
00:01:23.584,00:01:28.129,"To recap, you will be playing those Madonna hits throughout the day at an earsplitting volume."
00:01:28.171,00:01:29.590,Understood?
00:01:31.174,00:01:32.509,Santana.
00:01:32.551,00:01:33.969,What does your bracelet say?
00:01:34.011,00:01:35.136,W.W.M.D.
00:01:37.180,00:01:40.601,"Well, the answer to that question is usually date a younger man."
00:01:40.642,00:01:43.062,"So, let's see some arm candy, girls."
00:01:43.102,00:01:44.312,"Sorry, freshmen."
00:01:44.354,00:01:46.774,You're going to have to start trolling the middle schools.
00:01:46.815,00:01:47.942,And you know why?
00:01:47.983,00:01:58.410,"'Cause if you want to be as riveting a performer as Madonna-- a skill that will nab us Nationals this year-- you're going to have to start thinking like her, acting like her."
00:01:58.452,00:02:00.161,Also...
00:02:00.203,00:02:03.624,"Ã  la Madonna, I will no longer acknowledge that any of you have last names."
00:02:03.665,00:02:05.125,Becky Jackson.
00:02:11.214,00:02:15.636,"You know, it's like Madonna once said, I'm tough, I'm ambitious, and I know what I want."
00:02:19.222,00:02:23.393,I'm pretty sure she stole that line from one Sue Sylvester.
00:02:25.104,00:02:26.396,I said it first.
00:02:28.023,00:02:32.694,'87.
00:02:37.240,00:02:38.993,Can I ask you guys something private?
00:02:39.034,00:02:40.160,"Yes, you should move to Israel."
00:02:45.248,00:02:47.208,It's about dating.
00:02:47.250,00:02:48.543,Not that I'm dating anyone.
00:02:55.258,00:03:03.017,"Let's just say, hypothetically, we went to a Wiggles concert last Friday night, and then because my dads weren't home, we went up to my room and started making out."
00:03:05.268,00:03:06.145,And then he said...
00:03:09.188,00:03:11.066,It?
00:03:13.944,00:03:15.821,No.
00:03:17.447,00:03:19.074,What do you think?
00:03:20.283,00:03:23.120,It's no big deal.
00:03:25.288,00:03:29.918,"What if then he got really crabby and left, and didn't even take home the Care Bear I won him playing Skee Ball?"
00:03:29.960,00:03:33.047,QUINN: stop talking?ase You're grossing out my baby.
00:03:33.088,00:03:41.180,"I just want to be ready; I know I'm getting older, and these things are going to happen someday, but how do I stop a guy from getting mad at me for saying no?"
00:03:41.221,00:03:42.764,Just do what I do.
00:03:42.806,00:03:45.517,"Oh, totally. I mean, what's the worst that can happen?"
00:03:45.559,00:03:48.269,"Sorry, Quinn."
00:03:48.311,00:03:49.980,The last guy I liked was the mayor of gaytown.
00:03:50.022,00:03:53.901,And I can't wait to get a guy mad at me for saying no.
00:03:51.314,00:03:55.861,We just have to accept that guys don't care about our feelings.
00:04:01.324,00:04:04.578,"However, if you're planning on getting all up on this, I'm going to need you to make some changes."
00:04:04.619,00:04:09.457,"The goth thing was two years ago, so maybe lose the vampire makeup and consider some tighter-fitting clothing."
00:04:09.499,00:04:13.336,"You've got the pow, and I believe you should work it more if we're going to be an item."
00:04:14.588,00:04:16.715,That's got to sting.
00:04:17.799,00:04:22.387,"Hey, guys. I'm sorry to interrupt your little sorority, but I couldn't help but overhearing."
00:04:22.429,00:04:25.390,Are you really having that much boy trouble?
00:04:25.432,00:04:28.351,"You wouldn't understand, Mr. Shue."
00:04:30.353,00:04:32.355,"Well, then maybe you should talk to someone else about it."
00:04:32.397,00:04:34.191,Like Ms. Pillsbury.
00:04:34.233,00:04:36.568,"Oh, um, that's a hot-button topic, isn't it?"
00:04:36.610,00:04:38.195,"I mean, when to do that."
00:04:38.237,00:04:40.114,This is the perfect chat to have with your mom.
00:04:41.364,00:04:43.324,"Right, right-- you, um..."
00:04:43.366,00:04:44.659,How about your rabbi?
00:04:50.373,00:04:51.792,Uh...
00:04:53.376,00:04:59.258,The fact is is that women still earn 70 cents to every dollar that a man does for doing the same job.
00:04:59.299,00:05:01.301,That attitude starts in high school.
00:05:21.404,00:05:23.991,"No! No, no, no. No, that's not what you were offering."
00:05:24.032,00:05:25.366,Just...
00:05:26.409,00:05:27.661,Wishful thinking is all that was.
00:05:27.702,00:05:30.747,"I mean, what this is all really about is teenage girls feeling like they have no power."
00:05:30.789,00:05:32.457,"Right, and it makes sense, too."
00:05:30.789,00:05:35.294,"I mean, look at their role models, you know?"
00:05:41.675,00:05:46.096,Let's work together to try to find a way to make them feel more confident about themselves.
00:05:48.431,00:05:51.101,"Yes, we will change the world one girl at a time."
00:05:51.143,00:05:52.853,We'll be like a girl-saving team.
00:05:52.894,00:05:57.649,"And maybe along the way, we can find a way to help you, too."
00:07:21.524,00:07:27.572,"Somewhere in the English countryside, in a stately manor home, Madonna is weeping!"
00:07:33.370,00:07:34.495,"Oh, hey, William."
00:07:34.537,00:07:39.167,I thought I smelled cookies wafting from the ovens of the little elves who live in your hair.
00:07:39.209,00:07:40.794,"Wow, Sue."
00:07:40.835,00:07:42.503,"Yeah, well, Madonna is legend."
00:07:42.545,00:07:48.385,"And I want my girls to learn all the lessons she has to offer: strength, independence..."
00:07:48.427,00:07:52.389,Nobody quite like the Material Girl to empower my Cheerios.
00:07:52.431,00:07:56.851,Just like your hairdresser has empowered you to look absolutely ridiculous.
00:07:58.019,00:07:59.479,"I'll see you later, Sue."
00:08:02.232,00:08:03.608,You think this is hard?!
00:08:03.650,00:08:06.445,I'm passing a gallstone as we speak!
00:08:06.486,00:08:07.570,That's hard!
00:08:10.365,00:08:11.532,Genius.
00:08:12.575,00:08:14.077,Hall of Fame MILF.
00:08:24.045,00:08:25.964,Yes! Yes!
00:08:26.006,00:08:27.841,"PUCK: Uh, Mr. Shue?"
00:08:27.882,00:08:30.218,"As a dude, Madonna makes me kind of uncomfortable."
00:08:30.260,00:08:33.430,"FINN: Yeah, she's smokin' and everything, but can't some of us do something else?"
00:08:33.472,00:08:35.265,Like the guy version of Madonna?
00:08:35.307,00:08:37.976,"Like, you know, Pantera?"
00:08:38.018,00:08:44.607,"Guys! You know, it's come to my attention that many of you haven't been treating the young ladies of our group very nicely lately."
00:08:44.649,00:08:49.737,"You're disrespectful, bullying, sexist, and I hate to say it, misogynistic."
00:08:49.779,00:08:51.614,I have no idea what that means.
00:08:51.656,00:08:55.327,"When I pulled my hamstring, I went to a misogynist."
00:08:57.078,00:09:01.166,"What it means is, put yourself in their shoes for a change."
00:09:01.208,00:09:11.676,"Culturally, Madonna's legacy transcends her music, because by and large, the subtext of her songs are about being strong, independent and-and confident, no matter what your sex."
00:09:15.514,00:09:18.641,And that is something I think you guys need to work on.
00:09:18.683,00:09:25.857,"Mr. Shue, I don't think we can have an honest conversation about Ms. Ciccone without acknowledging that her images are as indelible as her songs."
00:09:25.899,00:09:31.112,I would like to honor her contributions by tackling a multi-media project with Mercedes.
00:09:32.655,00:09:34.282,I'm still not down.
00:09:35.658,00:09:38.203,I just don't think her music translates to show choir.
00:09:38.245,00:09:41.248,"Really? Well I, for one, couldn't disagree more."
00:09:47.962,00:09:49.672,"Come on, girls!"
00:09:49.714,00:09:52.217,Do you believe in love?
00:09:52.259,00:09:56.012,"'Cause I got something to say about it, and it goes something like this."
00:11:57.258,00:12:00.719,That's what I'm talking about.
00:12:04.057,00:12:06.393,"Oh, I look smokin' hot."
00:12:06.434,00:12:07.185,Guess who I'm dating.
00:12:07.227,00:12:09.062,Who?
00:12:10.771,00:12:12.440,He plays soccer with my sister.
00:12:13.650,00:12:15.776,Oh! Crap.
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.362,"I need a younger, inferior man."
00:12:17.404,00:12:20.615,"If I don't find one, Coach Sylvester will kick me off the Cheerios, for sure."
00:12:20.657,00:12:21.782,Hello? Finn!
00:12:21.824,00:12:25.161,"His birthday's like three days before yours, and he's super dumb."
00:12:25.203,00:12:27.080,"We already tried with Finn, and he hates us."
00:12:27.121,00:12:30.584,"Trust me, the way to get a man to follow you forever..."
00:12:30.625,00:12:32.460,take his virginity.
00:12:32.502,00:12:34.795,"Madonna, like, wrote a song about it."
00:12:38.883,00:12:40.510,"Hey, Finnocence."
00:12:43.221,00:12:45.056,"Just you and me this time, no third wheel."
00:12:45.098,00:12:46.849,Will you talk to me this time?
00:12:46.891,00:12:48.643,I don't really talk during.
00:12:50.228,00:12:53.523,"Look, Finn, It's high time you lost the big V."
00:12:53.565,00:12:55.609,Everything about you screams virgin.
00:12:55.650,00:12:57.902,You're about as sexy as a Cabbage Patch Kid.
00:12:57.944,00:13:00.697,It's exhausting to look at you.
00:13:00.739,00:13:04.825,"Well, look, I appreciate the offer, but I have feelings for someone else, and I'm trying to work things out with them. So..."
00:13:04.867,00:13:06.244,"Who, Rachel?"
00:13:06.286,00:13:08.204,She's dating that Jessie kid from Vocal Adrenaline.
00:13:08.246,00:13:09.247,"No, she's not."
00:13:09.289,00:13:11.249,"Please, you can smell it on her."
00:13:11.291,00:13:12.542,She's like a cat in heat.
00:13:12.584,00:13:17.338,She talked about him yesterday and practically sprayed the choir room.
00:13:17.380,00:13:20.300,"So come on, let's do the deed."
00:13:20.341,00:13:23.511,"It'll be great for my image, and Sue will promote me to head cheerleader."
00:13:23.553,00:13:24.638,It's win-win.
00:13:24.679,00:13:28.099,"Wait, what... what do I get out of it?"
00:13:28.141,00:13:29.267,I don't know.
00:13:29.309,00:13:31.561,You get to have sex and make Rachel jealous.
00:13:31.603,00:13:34.063,"I meant for me, okay?"
00:13:38.735,00:13:39.860,You wanted to see me?
00:13:41.904,00:13:43.323,"Um, yeah, thank you for coming."
00:13:43.364,00:13:44.365,Please sit down.
00:13:45.700,00:13:47.494,Okay.
00:13:47.535,00:13:52.666,"Um, I was just wondering why Madonna's playing everywhere except my office."
00:13:52.707,00:13:54.292,"Well, it's simple, Arlene."
00:13:54.334,00:13:57.253,You don't deserve the power of Madonna.
00:13:57.295,00:14:01.382,"You have none of her self-confidence, her power over her body or her sexual magnetism."
00:14:01.424,00:14:07.888,"Simply put, you have all the sensuality of one of those pandas down at the zoo who refuse to mate."
00:14:07.930,00:14:12.185,"I had your, uh, intercom disconnected."
00:14:17.940,00:14:19.359,There you go.
00:14:19.400,00:14:21.277,"Finn, I was just coming to find you."
00:14:37.960,00:14:39.587,Who-who told you that?
00:14:39.629,00:14:45.301,"Look, I know things have been weird between us, but I never thought you'd lie to me."
00:14:45.343,00:14:47.387,"Look, please just don't tell anyone."
00:14:47.428,00:14:48.638,Unbelievable.
00:14:48.680,00:14:53.727,"We may not be together the way that Jessie and I are, but we can still be friends."
00:14:53.768,00:14:59.440,I-I'm asking you as my friend to trust me.
00:15:08.408,00:15:10.243,Noted.
00:15:10.284,00:15:12.953,"All right, let's rehearse, then."
00:17:28.297,00:17:29.757,Th-That was good.
00:17:29.799,00:17:31.634,Totally.
00:17:35.805,00:17:37.598,I'm going to Kabbalah.
00:17:37.640,00:17:40.018,"Hey, guys, how's this week's assignment coming along?"
00:17:40.059,00:17:41.101,"Oh, amazing."
00:17:41.143,00:17:43.897,"You know how Madonna kind of reinvented the video, right?"
00:17:43.938,00:17:46.106,"Well, we got Artie and the A/V Club to help out."
00:17:48.026,00:17:49.569,It's going to be Madge-ical.
00:17:49.610,00:17:51.779,"Madge-- you know, Madonna's nickname?"
00:17:51.821,00:17:53.614,"Okay, you really got to get up to speed here."
00:17:53.656,00:17:55.115,Hey...
00:17:56.325,00:18:00.162,I heard a juicy little rumor that your Up With People rejects were doing some Madonna songs.
00:18:00.204,00:18:03.917,"Yeah, well, to be honest, Sue, I got inspired watching your Cheerios."
00:18:10.423,00:18:13.551,"Madonna belongs to me, and I will not be copied."
00:18:13.593,00:18:15.011,It's in my contract.
00:18:15.053,00:18:17.388,I want you to listen very closely.
00:18:17.430,00:18:21.726,You can have your Barbras and your Chers and your Christinas...
00:18:21.768,00:18:24.020,"and wow, I just lost my train of thought."
00:18:24.062,00:18:25.605,You have so much margarine in your hair.
00:18:25.646,00:18:28.608,"Okay, first of all, my kids are doing Madonna."
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.613,"Secondly, enough with the hair jokes."
00:18:33.654,00:18:37.157,"Oh, by the way, how's the Florence Henderson look working out for you?"
00:18:37.199,00:18:40.411,Oh...
00:18:40.453,00:18:43.957,"Oh, maybe you should try a new setting on your Flowbee."
00:19:04.518,00:19:07.480,"SUE: Who else wants a piece of this, huh?!"
00:19:21.160,00:19:26.499,"Hey, uh, so, that offer of yours uh, to lose... the big V..."
00:19:26.540,00:19:27.875,Mm-hmm.
00:19:27.917,00:19:29.710,...I'm in.
00:19:38.552,00:19:40.304,"Ms. Sylvester, we'd like a word."
00:19:40.346,00:19:43.432,We saw how upset you got today.
00:19:48.270,00:19:50.106,Close the door.
00:19:51.482,00:19:53.233,Sit down.
00:20:00.282,00:20:05.245,"My parents were famous Nazi hunters, so they weren't around a lot."
00:20:05.287,00:20:07.081,I had to bring her up on my own.
00:20:07.123,00:20:11.460,I didn't have a lot of time or money to keep up with all the latest looks.
00:20:13.212,00:20:16.174,"But on my sixth birthday, True Blue was released."
00:20:16.215,00:20:20.427,An album that would later sell over 30 million copies.
00:20:25.307,00:20:27.143,"Ammonia, napalm."
00:20:27.185,00:20:31.981,"My hair was so damaged, I've been forced to wear it short ever since."
00:20:34.316,00:20:36.569,"Wait, that would make you, like, 30."
00:20:36.610,00:20:37.695,29.
00:20:37.737,00:20:46.453,"And here's the truth-- I mercilessly pick on Will Schuester's lustrous, wavy hair because I'm jealous."
00:20:49.331,00:20:50.457,I think we can help.
00:20:52.334,00:20:53.335,We make culture.
00:20:53.377,00:20:54.503,Go on.
00:20:58.340,00:21:00.300,And we can help you find a new look.
00:21:15.816,00:21:17.401,Sondheim on Music.
00:21:17.443,00:21:19.153,"Jessie, is that you?"
00:21:19.195,00:21:20.738,I'm so glad you came.
00:21:20.780,00:21:28.370,"I picked the Stephen Sondheim biography section for our clandestine meeting place, because only he would be able to express my melancholia."
00:21:28.412,00:21:30.790,I feel bad about what happened at your house.
00:21:32.374,00:21:33.709,Yes.
00:21:33.751,00:21:37.130,"Since we're meeting in the shadows, there's something I wanted to talk to you about."
00:21:37.171,00:21:38.380,Me first.
00:21:38.422,00:21:39.840,I was out of line the other night.
00:21:41.383,00:21:47.848,"You deserve romance-- no, you deserve epic romance."
00:21:53.395,00:21:55.397,I'm willing to wait.
00:22:04.073,00:22:06.325,What did you want to tell me?
00:22:08.452,00:22:10.246,I'm ready.
00:22:18.420,00:22:22.216,"Hey, that catch was amazing Will!"
00:22:26.344,00:22:31.558,"Good. Um... okay, I've realized something, something really important."
00:22:31.600,00:22:39.984,"You know when we were talking about Madonna the other day and how her music was being blasted like an intimidating cluster bomb into everybody's office except for mine because, apparently, I lack a shred of sex appeal?"
00:22:42.444,00:22:44.488,Her life is her own.
00:22:44.530,00:22:45.572,Okay.
00:22:45.614,00:22:51.453,"So I need to take control of myself and my body, just like Madonna."
00:22:52.454,00:22:53.998,Which is why...
00:22:54.040,00:22:58.336,I'm planning on doing the nasty with you tonight at your place.
00:23:01.463,00:23:05.009,"So, what do you think?"
00:23:06.468,00:23:07.427,I couldn't agree more.
00:23:07.469,00:23:08.512,Great.
00:23:08.554,00:23:09.847,7:30.
00:23:23.736,00:23:25.403,and action.
00:23:27.573,00:23:29.449,And playback.
00:23:47.093,00:23:48.426,Strike a pose.
00:29:22.428,00:29:24.763,JESSIE: Rachel?
00:29:26.848,00:29:28.767,I'm ready.
00:29:34.690,00:29:36.275,Our project was a triumph.
00:29:38.444,00:29:39.903,Doesn't matter.
00:29:39.945,00:29:41.739,"Oh, dear."
00:29:44.241,00:29:45.492,Miss Sylvester.
00:29:45.534,00:29:48.412,"Oh, hey, there, Whoopi, Don Knotts."
00:29:48.454,00:29:50.414,What happened?
00:29:50.456,00:29:55.043,"All those costumes and the hairstyles, I'm gonna leave constant reinvention to Madonna."
00:29:55.085,00:29:57.921,Know why? Had a revelation.
00:29:57.963,00:30:02.676,Here's a list of the kids I want shipped off to New York with 35 bucks in their pocket.
00:30:02.718,00:30:04.219,Operation Madonna is now complete.
00:30:04.261,00:30:06.722,"Sue, these are all Glee kids."
00:30:06.764,00:30:09.767,"Um... I-I'm sorry, Sue."
00:30:09.808,00:30:11.059,I'm having trouble concentrating.
00:30:11.101,00:30:12.311,Your new look is...
00:30:12.352,00:30:14.563,"Fantastic. Yeah, I agree."
00:30:14.605,00:30:15.689,Unnecessary.
00:30:15.731,00:30:16.898,"Sue, you're a powerful woman."
00:30:16.940,00:30:19.526,You don't need to copy anyone else.
00:30:19.568,00:30:22.488,"You're an original, just like Madonna."
00:30:22.529,00:30:24.030,Don't lose that quality.
00:30:24.072,00:30:29.578,"Do you mean that, or are you just saying that because I poked a couple of kids' eyes out before second period today?"
00:30:30.996,00:30:34.874,"See, kids, Sue Sylvester realized she didn't need to reinvent herself."
00:30:34.916,00:30:37.753,"She needs to reinvent everybody else, starting with you two."
00:30:44.426,00:30:46.052,Hey.
00:30:46.094,00:30:47.346,Hi.
00:30:47.387,00:30:49.889,So how'd your date with Jessie go Friday night?
00:30:49.931,00:30:52.685,It went wonderfully.
00:30:52.726,00:30:54.561,"Honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal."
00:30:54.603,00:30:58.607,"I mean, you know, it-it was great."
00:31:04.946,00:31:06.573,Just come out so we can talk...
00:31:06.615,00:31:08.701,or sing about it.
00:31:12.162,00:31:15.749,"Look, Jessie, I really like you, but..."
00:31:15.791,00:31:17.584,I can't do it.
00:31:17.626,00:31:20.796,It wouldn't be right for... the team.
00:31:20.838,00:31:23.298,What does the team have to do with this?
00:31:23.340,00:31:28.804,"If I give myself to you knowing that my teammates wouldn't approve, it would be like I was sleeping with the enemy."
00:31:28.846,00:31:31.765,I'd be betraying them.
00:31:31.807,00:31:35.769,"And because I'm truly not ready to do this, I'd be betraying myself."
00:31:37.771,00:31:39.189,I'm happy for you.
00:31:42.442,00:31:44.528,I heard that you had a date with Santana on Friday night.
00:31:44.570,00:31:47.447,Yeah. I-I couldn't go through with it.
00:31:47.489,00:31:49.032,Why?
00:31:49.074,00:31:51.951,I guess I'm just waiting for the right person.
00:31:51.993,00:31:55.163,Do you think they have room service in this place?
00:31:55.205,00:31:56.665,'Cause I want a burger.
00:31:56.707,00:31:58.958,I thought I'd feel different after.
00:31:59.000,00:32:04.590,"Yeah, well, I've noticed that it takes about 20 or so times before the feeling of accomplishment really kicks in."
00:32:08.594,00:32:09.969,How do you feel?
00:32:10.011,00:32:13.766,I don't feel anything...
00:32:26.862,00:32:29.989,Where have you been? I've been calling you all weekend.
00:32:30.031,00:32:31.658,I was kind of embarrassed.
00:32:31.700,00:32:35.662,"I really wanted to go through with it, Will."
00:32:38.624,00:32:42.878,"handsome, and it felt so good to be close to you in that way."
00:32:42.920,00:32:45.464,"I just, I don't know why I always freak out like that."
00:32:47.633,00:32:49.802,You don't need to sleep with me to prove anything.
00:32:49.843,00:32:52.930,You took ownership of your body on Friday when you told yourself you weren't ready...
00:32:52.971,00:32:55.014,and then ran out of my apartment with no shoes on.
00:32:55.056,00:32:56.850,They're my favorites.
00:33:05.066,00:33:07.861,I never should have agreed to have you come over that night.
00:33:10.530,00:33:11.657,That is the point.
00:33:11.698,00:33:13.283,We're falling into a pattern here.
00:33:14.242,00:33:19.456,We need to instate an official no-dating policy until my divorce is final.
00:33:19.498,00:33:22.334,"Well, when will that be?"
00:33:22.375,00:33:25.337,I filed today.
00:33:25.378,00:33:27.046,So that's a start.
00:33:27.088,00:33:33.052,"But while we're waiting, I want you to get some help for your problems; we need to take action here."
00:33:35.096,00:33:39.058,"Now, our health union covers counseling."
00:33:39.100,00:33:42.604,"They'll come to the school, meet you in your office, whatever you need."
00:33:44.940,00:33:47.693,And...
00:33:47.734,00:33:49.736,I polished them myself.
00:33:56.743,00:33:58.411,Thank you.
00:34:03.500,00:34:04.793,Mr. Schuester?
00:34:04.835,00:34:06.085,Yes?
00:34:06.127,00:34:07.921,I'm Jessie St. James.
00:34:07.963,00:34:09.840,Can I talk to you about something?
00:34:11.550,00:34:15.094,What the hell?! It seems like now everybody's doing things just to hurt my feelings.
00:34:15.136,00:34:17.514,I thought you all would take this news a little better.
00:34:17.556,00:34:18.765,You can learn from me.
00:34:18.807,00:34:20.308,We were already fighting for second leads.
00:34:23.144,00:34:24.563,"Yeah, that's right."
00:34:28.149,00:34:30.151,"He's a spy, Mr. Shue."
00:34:30.193,00:34:31.695,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys."
00:34:31.737,00:34:33.530,"I saw all the paperwork, I spoke with his parents..."
00:34:33.572,00:34:34.614,They winter in Bali.
00:34:34.656,00:34:35.991,It's a very expensive phone call.
00:34:36.033,00:34:39.118,"WILL: Jessie just moved in with his uncle, which is in our school district."
00:34:39.160,00:34:40.746,"It's all above board, guys."
00:34:42.163,00:34:43.415,But this isn't fair.
00:34:43.456,00:34:44.583,Guys!
00:34:44.624,00:34:47.836,Everyone who's ever auditioned for this group has gotten in.
00:34:47.878,00:34:49.128,That's how we do things here.
00:34:49.170,00:34:53.842,"Okay, to suddenly change the rules now, that would be unfair."
00:34:53.884,00:34:55.218,Brittany.
00:34:55.260,00:34:57.596,"Mr. Shue, is he your son?"
00:34:59.806,00:35:01.725,I don't understand why you're doing this.
00:35:01.767,00:35:03.727,"Because when you love something, you got to go for it."
00:35:03.769,00:35:07.064,You would never be with me completely if I were on the opposing team.
00:35:07.105,00:35:09.775,And I care about you more than winning another national title.
00:35:10.859,00:35:12.318,So I left Vocal Adrenaline.
00:35:12.360,00:35:13.445,For you.
00:35:14.905,00:35:17.156,"WILL: All right, guys, we have got a lot of work to do."
00:35:19.117,00:35:20.786,Welcome aboard.
00:35:20.827,00:35:21.745,"Okay, from the top."
00:35:35.508,00:37:07.851,"MERCEDES: Sue, what the hell is going on here?"
00:37:07.893,00:37:09.853,"Oh, what's the matter, buddy?"
00:37:09.895,00:37:11.270,You probably had to run to the powder room.
00:37:12.313,00:37:18.653,Future center square Kurt Hummel there and his brassy hag Mercedes just tore that Madonna song a new one.
00:37:18.695,00:37:19.696,"Wait, you two are Cheerios now?"
00:37:19.738,00:37:23.783,"Yeah, I've decided to add vocals to my already wildly overproduced Cheerios numbers."
00:37:25.827,00:37:27.537,You guys could've at least given me the heads-up.
00:37:27.579,00:37:31.499,"You mean, the same way you gave us a heads-up before not giving us a solo almost every week?"
00:37:31.541,00:37:38.965,"KURT: Mr. Shue, Mercedes and I talked it over, and we love being in Glee, but being in the Cheerios will give us more opportunities to shine."
00:37:40.341,00:37:42.510,"Ah, chipper up, Tiger."
00:37:42.552,00:37:47.599,"You know, I was down at the pharmacy today, and they're having a monster sale on Dep."
00:37:47.640,00:37:49.226,Dep is a hair gel.
00:37:49.267,00:37:52.979,"And once again, I am making fun of your incredibly stupid hairdo."
00:37:59.819,00:38:06.743,"Girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short, wear shirts and boots, 'cause it's okay to be a boy."
00:38:06.785,00:38:13.416,"But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading, 'cause you think that being a girl is degrading."
00:38:13.458,00:38:17.336,"But secretly you'd love to know what it's like, wouldn't you?"
00:39:30.618,00:39:32.120,I am not down with this.
00:39:33.663,00:39:35.414,That's because it's easy to be a dude.
00:39:35.456,00:39:38.918,"Uh, Mr. Shue, I think we're gonna need a new baritone, 'cause Finn would like to become Finnessa."
00:39:38.960,00:39:40.045,"Wait, h-hold on, Puck."
00:39:40.086,00:39:41.046,Finn has a point.
00:39:43.673,00:39:44.716,ARTIE: I have.
00:39:44.757,00:39:47.677,I think the way I was objectifying Tina may have sent her over the edge.
00:39:49.846,00:39:51.472,My eyes are up here!
00:39:54.184,00:39:59.272,"I am a powerful woman, and my growing feminism will cut you in half like a righteous blade of equality!"
00:40:01.440,00:40:05.444,"We've been treating the girls like crap-- not caring about their feelings, not listening, objectifying."
00:40:05.486,00:40:06.821,"That's the right word, right, Mr. Shue?"
00:40:06.863,00:40:07.697,That's right.
00:40:07.739,00:40:11.117,"As an honorary girl, I have to agree."
00:40:11.159,00:40:14.453,"This team shouldn't work, but it does because we respect each other's talent."
00:40:14.495,00:40:18.708,"And if we want to take it to the next level, we have to start respecting each other as individuals."
00:40:18.750,00:40:20.626,Really see each other.
00:40:20.668,00:40:23.755,"Why were you singing with us, Mr. Shue?"
00:40:23.796,00:40:28.467,Because apparently...
00:40:28.509,00:40:30.887,"Fine, but I'm not singing this song."
00:40:30.929,00:40:32.264,We don't have to.
00:40:32.305,00:40:36.726,"We just have to make it right with the girls, show them we get how it feels."
00:40:38.811,00:40:41.147,I would get down on one knee if I could.
00:40:42.565,00:40:43.566,You don't even like me.
00:40:43.608,00:40:45.068,Stop.
00:40:45.110,00:40:46.194,That's where you're wrong.
00:40:46.236,00:40:48.947,I was really rude to you.
00:40:48.988,00:40:51.157,You're awesome.
00:40:51.199,00:40:53.701,"And you shouldn't change, unless you want to."
00:40:53.743,00:40:59.457,"And if you want to get up on this, just let me know."
00:41:03.378,00:41:06.714,Yep. That's more like it.
00:41:09.550,00:41:11.010,Hey.
00:41:11.052,00:41:13.596,"If you're gonna criticize and mock me again about Jessie, you can can it."
00:41:16.557,00:41:20.812,The only reason you were even open to dating Jessie was because I was such an ass.
00:41:20.853,00:41:23.440,Mr. Tough Guy and all that.
00:41:23.481,00:41:25.358,I really liked you.
00:41:25.400,00:41:28.694,"And I could have had you, but I blew it."
00:41:28.736,00:41:31.864,You really liked me?
00:41:32.615,00:41:34.575,"Okay, Finn."
00:41:32.615,00:41:37.578,"I know we have a big showdown coming, so let's just decide on the arena."
00:41:37.620,00:41:40.539,"Sing-off, the parking lot, 5:00-- be there."
00:41:40.581,00:41:42.083,No.
00:41:43.751,00:41:45.670,Welcome to New Directions.
00:41:46.754,00:41:49.757,"Frankly, I need you. I'm tired of carrying the male vocals all by myself."
00:41:51.884,00:41:55.347,I'll do my best to stay away from your girl.
00:41:55.388,00:41:57.556,I appreciate that.
00:41:57.598,00:41:58.933,She's a keeper.
00:41:58.975,00:42:00.559,Walk with me to the auditorium.
00:42:00.601,00:42:03.562,I put together a new Madonna number; I'll talk you through it on the way.
00:42:03.604,00:42:05.606,Sweet.
00:00:07.257,00:00:09.718,It's enough to want to give up women all together.
00:00:09.760,00:00:13.347,"Will's old crush, April, joined the Glee Club, but she was drunk all the time, so Will kicked her out."
00:00:13.388,00:00:17.309,"Also, Sue convinced Kurtand Mercedes that they should join the Cheerios!, which Will was none too happy about."
00:00:17.351,00:00:27.152,"And that's what you missed Ladies, what we have here is a grade-A dilemma."
00:00:27.194,00:00:34.326,"Mercedes, your vocal chords have had more fantastic runs than a Kenyan track team, but that look simply will not do."
00:00:34.368,00:00:39.540,"At first, I thought it was a subtle homage to yours truly, but now I fear it's some sort of ironic comment."
00:00:39.581,00:00:43.502,"Ms. Sylvester, I'm just not comfortable in those Cheerios! skirts."
00:00:45.128,00:00:47.130,"Mercedes, you shouldn't feel embarrassed about your body."
00:00:47.172,00:00:48.549,Embarrassed?
00:00:48.590,00:00:52.135,"No, no. I'm worried about showing too much skin and causing a sex riot."
00:00:55.931,00:00:58.017,How do you two not have a show on Bravo?
00:01:07.776,00:01:17.661,"In seven days, reporter Tracey Pendergrass will arrive on campus, and my new star singer will have lost ten pounds, and be in a gender-appropriate cheerleading uniform, or she is off the team."
00:01:19.329,00:01:21.289,KURT: Ten pounds?
00:01:21.331,00:01:22.917,Are you serious?
00:01:24.251,00:01:25.586,You got hips like a pear.
00:01:27.170,00:01:34.219,"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to put in a call to the Ohio Secretary of State, notifying them I will no longer be carrying photo I.D."
00:01:34.261,00:01:36.388,You know why?
00:01:36.430,00:01:42.310,People should know who I am.
00:01:42.352,00:01:44.187,Sue! We need to talk.
00:01:44.229,00:01:46.189,The auditorium is padlocked!
00:01:46.231,00:01:47.357,"Well, that's curious."
00:01:47.399,00:01:49.150,Did you check the sign-up sheet?
00:01:49.192,00:01:50.360,What sign-up sheet?
00:01:50.402,00:01:54.197,"Why, the one I keep right here in my waistband, William. Let's see."
00:01:54.239,00:01:57.743,"Yeah, I've got the entire week booked solid."
00:01:57.785,00:02:00.203,Got a big magazine feature coming up.
00:02:00.245,00:02:03.164,It's a little chilly practicing outdoors.
00:02:03.206,00:02:06.085,"Yeah? Well, let's see what Figgins has to say about this."
00:02:06.126,00:02:09.797,"Oh, I'm sure Figgins will just mumble something nervously and then pretend to take a phone call."
00:02:11.882,00:02:16.177,"WILL: Um, all right, I have one final announcement before we all leave."
00:02:16.219,00:02:19.222,We can't use the auditorium for the next week.
00:02:19.264,00:02:21.266,But that's garbage.
00:02:19.264,00:02:22.225,How are we supposed to practice for Regionals without the auditorium?
00:02:24.227,00:02:26.229,There's nothing I can do.
00:02:26.271,00:02:28.398,I recommend a sit-in.
00:02:29.817,00:02:34.195,"No. Look, we've all faced adversity before, and we've come out stronger on the other end."
00:02:34.237,00:02:38.199,"I'm going to check out a few off-site locations for us to use, just for the week."
00:02:38.241,00:02:40.201,I promise I'll find us a new home.
00:02:44.957,00:02:47.292,"Oh, Finn, I wanted your opinion on this."
00:02:47.334,00:02:48.585,It's a swatch board.
00:02:50.253,00:02:53.590,Kind of going for a hunting lodge meets Tom Ford's place in Bel Air.
00:02:53.632,00:02:56.927,I was hoping you could help me out with the hunting lodge part.
00:03:02.432,00:03:04.893,But I guess that one's nice.
00:03:06.269,00:03:08.522,I always pegged you as a chinoiserie type.
00:03:16.279,00:03:17.656,This is healthy!
00:03:17.698,00:03:19.867,"Chicken breast and a salad, dressing on the side."
00:03:19.908,00:03:21.535,You have a week to lose ten pounds.
00:03:24.079,00:03:26.040,Look at what I'm eating-- peeled celery.
00:03:26.081,00:03:27.624,"And for breakfast, I had Splenda."
00:03:27.666,00:03:31.419,"Look, Mercedes, now that we're cheerleaders, we're finally part of the in crowd."
00:03:31.461,00:03:32.880,We have a place at the table.
00:03:32.921,00:03:35.256,We don't have to beg underneath for scraps of attention.
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.342,Don't screw it up.
00:03:37.384,00:03:39.761,BRITTANY: I'm pretty sure my cat's been reading my diary.
00:03:39.803,00:03:42.639,"Hey, guys."
00:03:42.681,00:03:44.725,How do you manage to stay so skinny?
00:03:47.310,00:03:55.443,"Water, maple syrup for glucose, lemon for acid, cayenne pepper to irritate the bowels, and a dash of ipecac, a vomiting agent."
00:03:55.485,00:03:59.198,I haven't had a solid meal since 1987.
00:03:59.239,00:04:02.283,Sometimes I add a teaspoon of sand.
00:04:02.325,00:04:04.078,That can't be healthy.
00:04:26.850,00:04:28.852,Why are you so upset?
00:04:31.354,00:04:33.314,Don't you have any feelings about it?
00:04:33.356,00:04:34.691,It's your and dad's honeymoon set.
00:04:34.733,00:04:36.317,I was conceived in that bed.
00:04:39.362,00:04:42.991,Well... I think that's everything.
00:04:43.033,00:04:44.576,You mentioned something about the recliner?
00:04:44.618,00:04:45.994,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:48.413,00:04:50.415,"Ooh, my wife would love this."
00:04:50.457,00:04:51.499,Sciatica.
00:04:53.752,00:04:55.879,It's not for sale.
00:05:06.389,00:05:10.351,"It's the only picture there will ever be of the two of us, and he's sitting in this chair."
00:05:13.438,00:05:14.564,What's going on with you?
00:05:19.861,00:05:21.529,"I'm seeing someone, Finn."
00:05:21.571,00:05:24.365,I think I'm in love.
00:05:26.409,00:05:27.869,"Uh, do I know him?"
00:05:27.911,00:05:31.498,It's your friend Kurt's father-- Burt Hummel.
00:05:36.044,00:05:39.256,Hey. I'd like to talk to someone about renting out this space.
00:05:39.298,00:05:42.550,"APRIL: Okay, fellas, grab a gal, or..."
00:05:56.439,00:06:00.277,I just had a sex dream about you!
00:06:00.319,00:06:01.903,"April. April, please stop speaking into the mic."
00:06:01.945,00:06:04.405,Wait...
00:06:05.448,00:06:08.327,I smell a duet coming on!
00:06:14.457,00:06:15.583,You own this place?
00:08:00.605,00:08:06.527,"I was so jazzed about sobering up and starting a new life, I had to stop at a bar to get a drink just to calm down."
00:08:06.569,00:08:10.115,Then I hung out at that bar for a few months or so.
00:08:10.157,00:08:15.203,"One day, an old codger, about 75, 80, came in, and asked to buy me a drink."
00:08:15.245,00:08:16.330,Get this.
00:08:16.371,00:08:18.915,Buddy Leibowitz.
00:08:18.957,00:08:21.751,Of Leibowitz Strip Malls?
00:08:24.587,00:08:26.923,"No. Don't look so disappointed, Will."
00:08:26.965,00:08:28.967,"I mean, who are we kidding really?"
00:08:29.009,00:08:31.178,I'm nothing but a washed-up dreamer.
00:08:31.219,00:08:33.347,It's all I'll ever be.
00:08:33.388,00:08:46.360,"Besides, I've finally realized my lifelong ambition of being a mistress to an incredibly wealthy strip mall tycoon and the owner-operator of a cabaret roller rink."
00:08:46.401,00:08:51.406,"Um, listen, about that-- well, the Glee Club kind of needs some rehearsal space."
00:08:51.448,00:08:53.992,Sue's commandeered the auditorium.
00:08:54.034,00:08:56.286,Are you kidding?
00:08:56.328,00:08:57.578,Really?
00:08:57.620,00:08:58.663,"Oh, that would be amazing!"
00:09:01.624,00:09:02.792,"Listen, uh, I got to run."
00:09:02.834,00:09:04.585,I've got an appointment to show my apartment.
00:09:04.627,00:09:05.753,"What's this, now?"
00:09:05.795,00:09:11.801,"Yeah, so I need to rent out my apartment and find a smaller place to live."
00:09:11.843,00:09:13.053,Uh...
00:09:17.640,00:09:19.309,So you're free to date?
00:09:21.520,00:09:24.272,"And by sleep with, I mean have sex with people."
00:09:24.314,00:09:25.482,People like me.
00:09:29.652,00:09:30.820,You're looking for a subletter.
00:09:30.862,00:09:33.614,I'm looking for a place to stay.
00:09:34.657,00:09:36.784,"I'm full-time fancy now, Will."
00:09:36.826,00:09:38.495,I'm gonna want to check the place out.
00:09:41.664,00:09:42.623,Tell you what.
00:09:55.678,00:09:57.264,"I lost two pounds, Coach."
00:09:59.682,00:10:06.440,"Instead of being different and an outcast, you're just like every other teenage girl in America-- sadly obsessed with vanity."
00:10:10.944,00:10:12.571,Congrats.
00:10:12.612,00:10:13.654,"Thanks, Coach."
00:10:20.703,00:10:23.164,"Yup, and I'm ready for my midweek weigh-in."
00:10:23.206,00:10:25.917,"I've been eating very well, and walking everywhere, and..."
00:10:25.959,00:10:27.252,"Okay, well, climb aboard."
00:10:27.294,00:10:30.505,Let's see how many libbies you lost.
00:10:31.548,00:10:33.341,"Well, look at that, Mercedes."
00:10:33.383,00:10:34.675,You've gained two pounds.
00:10:37.720,00:10:41.682,"You have four days to lose the weight, get yourself in a uniform, or you're out."
00:10:41.724,00:10:43.059,What am I gonna do?
00:10:43.101,00:10:44.519,"Well, you might try dropping the attitude."
00:10:44.561,00:10:46.521,I'm sure there's a pound or two in that.
00:10:46.563,00:10:52.319,"You know, with the Cheerios!, we have only one lesson, and it's very simple lesson: You do whatever it takes."
00:10:55.029,00:10:56.656,Next.
00:10:57.574,00:10:58.908,"Kurt, hey!"
00:10:57.574,00:11:00.577,What-What the hell's going on with our parents?
00:11:00.619,00:11:02.912,How did this happen? When did they even meet each other?
00:11:02.954,00:11:05.873,"Parent-Teacher conference night, about a month ago."
00:11:05.915,00:11:09.336,"I always accompany my father to those conferences, to act as translator."
00:11:09.377,00:11:11.712,How do you know this is not organic?
00:11:11.754,00:11:14.132,Because you can see the logo.
00:11:14.174,00:11:15.550,Fate brought them together.
00:11:15.592,00:11:17.552,"Dad, meet Carole Hudson."
00:11:17.594,00:11:19.095,"Ms. Hudson, my father-- Burt Hummel."
00:11:19.137,00:11:21.222,"You both have dead spouses, maybe you should talk."
00:11:21.264,00:11:23.933,"You know, I was just saying to a friend that acid wash should make a comeback."
00:11:25.393,00:11:27.228,And who said it ever left?
00:11:27.270,00:11:29.772,It was an instant connection.
00:11:34.444,00:11:37.113,Haven't you noticed anything different about your mom?
00:11:37.155,00:11:41.660,"New clothes, new makeup, a haircut that doesn't look like it was styled by the Amish?"
00:11:41.700,00:11:43.411,Who do you think Pretty Woman'ed her up?
00:11:43.453,00:11:45.163,Has she started selling the furniture yet?
00:11:45.205,00:11:46.747,"Yeah, yeah, she just got rid of her old bedroom set."
00:11:46.789,00:11:49.668,"And she tried to sell my dad's chair, but I stopped her."
00:11:49.708,00:11:51.336,How did you even know that?
00:11:53.796,00:11:55.382,They know what they want.
00:11:55.423,00:11:59.636,I guess you and I will be roommates with Mom and Dad cohabitating upstairs by midterms.
00:11:59.678,00:12:02.013,No way.
00:12:04.807,00:12:06.685,That's why I asked you about the swatches.
00:12:06.725,00:12:07.935,And don't sweat that old chair.
00:12:07.977,00:12:09.812,I have a lovely chaise picked out.
00:12:09.854,00:12:12.773,"Look-Look, screw you-your swatches and you-your chez."
00:12:12.815,00:12:14.401,Chaise.
00:12:14.442,00:12:15.985,"Look, I-I like my house."
00:12:16.027,00:12:19.531,"I'm not moving, and she's not selling that... that damn chair."
00:12:22.283,00:12:23.284,A roller rink?!
00:12:23.326,00:12:26.954,"Weren't those outlawed in, like, 1981, for being totally lame?"
00:12:26.996,00:12:29.416,"Oh, come on, guys, where's your sense of adventure?"
00:12:29.457,00:12:32.960,The space is great and April is giving it to us to practice in for free.
00:12:33.002,00:12:35.088,"Mr. Shue, if I may?"
00:12:38.132,00:12:42.011,New Directions! is clearly a club with a dearth of direction.
00:12:42.053,00:12:48.518,Rachel and Jessie refuse to accept that all of us would rather die before we allow them to become the next BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z.
00:12:48.560,00:12:54.441,And Finn's mother's romance with my father is sending him into a wholly unnecessary tailspin of despair.
00:12:55.734,00:13:04.909,"What we all need right now is to explore the idea of a sense of place and how, if we find that place within, we will get that happy ending."
00:16:10.470,00:16:11.846,"Hiya, hot stuff."
00:16:11.888,00:16:13.013,"Hey, April."
00:16:13.055,00:16:15.099,Um... come in.
00:16:15.141,00:16:17.435,What's with the... what's with the duffel bag?
00:16:17.477,00:16:20.020,Can't have an overnighter without an overnight bag.
00:16:20.062,00:16:21.689,Overnight?
00:16:21.731,00:16:25.485,"Baby, I'm an artist-- I don't go by brains, I go by feel."
00:16:25.526,00:16:28.947,"I need to settle in to the energy of the place, get to know the ghosts."
00:16:30.072,00:16:31.240,"Oh, he's out of town."
00:16:31.282,00:16:34.828,Something about buying a new kidney or lung.
00:16:38.247,00:16:39.874,"I'm not looking for a hookup, Will."
00:16:39.916,00:16:42.502,I just sleep better with someone inside the house.
00:16:44.086,00:16:47.047,"I guess I've been just feeling a little lonely, you know?"
00:16:47.089,00:16:48.716,Yeah. I know.
00:16:48.758,00:16:50.134,Just one night?
00:16:52.094,00:16:54.555,"Oh, look, do you want to sublet this place quick or not?"
00:16:57.099,00:16:58.726,And no funny business.
00:17:00.269,00:17:02.062,WILL: Um...
00:17:02.104,00:17:04.273,bathroom is right around the corner.
00:17:04.315,00:17:06.442,Sometimes you just need a little Burt.
00:17:06.484,00:17:08.903,Take whatever you want from the refrigerator.
00:17:08.945,00:17:10.070,April.
00:17:11.113,00:17:12.699,The liquor cabinet is off-limits.
00:17:16.703,00:17:18.705,"Good night, April."
00:17:19.622,00:17:22.500,"G'night, Will."
00:21:40.258,00:21:42.760,"Good night, April."
00:21:49.391,00:21:50.768,A toast.
00:21:53.395,00:21:58.025,It marks the first real communion between the Hummel and the Hudson clans.
00:22:03.823,00:22:07.576,So let me raise my Shirley Temple to our new little family.
00:22:10.412,00:22:11.455,Finn...
00:22:11.497,00:22:13.373,It's cool.
00:22:13.415,00:22:16.294,Your mom and I just enjoy each other's company right now.
00:22:16.335,00:22:17.377,Let's just enjoy dinner.
00:22:22.424,00:22:25.052,"Yeah, but I actually kind of like football better."
00:22:26.428,00:22:28.181,"Sounds crazy, but I miss getting hit."
00:22:30.432,00:22:31.391,"No, it isn't."
00:22:31.433,00:22:32.643,I totally get that.
00:22:32.685,00:22:36.272,I used to love the feeling of getting my clock cleaned and then popping right up.
00:22:38.440,00:22:41.401,Why hasn't anyone commented on the new jeans I got Carole?
00:22:41.443,00:22:42.903,"Oh, come on."
00:22:44.530,00:22:46.615,A welcome change.
00:22:46.657,00:22:49.576,"Sure, Kurt. Hey, you know, I sell tires to one of the assistant coaches from the Browns."
00:22:52.454,00:22:54.874,That'd be awesome.
00:22:54.915,00:22:55.875,"Well, no problem."
00:22:55.916,00:23:00.504,"Wow. You know, for a place called Breadstix, these really suck."
00:23:03.966,00:23:06.135,BURT: It's really just stale bread.
00:23:06.177,00:23:07.720,CAROLE: Yeah...
00:23:08.554,00:23:10.597,BURT: Hey.
00:23:10.639,00:23:12.225,You finally choose one?
00:23:12.266,00:23:13.433,No. They're all wrong.
00:23:13.475,00:23:15.228,"Well, they all look like gray to me."
00:23:15.269,00:23:19.648,"Well, maybe if they were different colored sports uniforms, you'd work harder to try and tell them apart."
00:23:28.490,00:23:31.077,I'm sorry. I don't know what you want here.
00:23:31.118,00:23:37.083,What I want is for you to appreciate how hard it is for me to watch you bond with the son that you've obviously always wanted.
00:23:37.124,00:23:41.461,"Oh, suddenly I'm not the guy who sat through Riverdance three years in a row?"
00:23:41.503,00:23:48.886,"Look, Kurt, I love you, and I am sympathetic to all of your stuff, but come on, buddy, we got a deal here."
00:23:48.928,00:23:52.681,"Right? I don't try to change you, you don't try to change me."
00:23:52.723,00:23:59.355,"You are my son, and a little guy talk with some other kid isn't gonna change that."
00:23:59.397,00:24:01.274,Guy talk?
00:24:01.315,00:24:03.483,I'm a guy.
00:24:06.820,00:24:09.489,Maybe I was wrong.
00:24:09.531,00:24:13.451,Maybe it is too soon for you to start getting serious with someone.
00:24:26.548,00:24:27.507,Wasn't it to make me happy?
00:24:27.549,00:24:29.093,'Cause that's what you told me.
00:24:31.553,00:24:35.724,"I'm a half an hour behind on my moisturizing routine, and I need to get up early."
00:24:42.856,00:24:45.609,TINA: Do you want half of my peppermint patty?
00:24:45.651,00:24:47.611,No. I don't put junk in my body.
00:24:47.653,00:24:48.821,Why are you doing this?
00:24:48.862,00:24:50.572,We like you no matter how you look.
00:24:50.614,00:24:52.532,And those shake diets are really unhealthy.
00:24:52.574,00:24:53.784,They also don't really work.
00:24:53.826,00:24:56.536,"As soon as you go off them, you gain back the weight you lost."
00:24:56.578,00:24:58.705,You know what?
00:24:58.747,00:25:02.460,You have no idea how much I'm sacrificing to be a Cheerio!
00:25:02.500,00:25:03.752,To look fantastic.
00:25:03.794,00:25:05.587,To finally fit in at this school.
00:25:11.593,00:25:13.429,We just want you to be healthy.
00:25:13.471,00:25:16.182,"Stop getting all up in my face, telling me what I can and cannot do."
00:25:16.223,00:25:18.976,"And I'm really hungry, so stop trying to get me to eat you!"
00:25:23.605,00:25:26.942,The point is that Fanny Brice is the most iconic work.
00:25:35.993,00:25:37.577,Oh...
00:25:37.619,00:25:38.996,Your blood pressure's low.
00:25:39.038,00:25:40.956,Maybe that's why you fainted.
00:25:40.998,00:25:42.582,Your mom will be here soon.
00:25:42.624,00:25:44.668,I'll go and get you some ginger ale.
00:25:55.513,00:25:56.596,"Yes, you are."
00:26:05.064,00:26:07.107,Yeah. How'd you know?
00:26:07.149,00:26:08.442,Been there.
00:26:08.484,00:26:11.237,Eat the granola bar.
00:26:14.656,00:26:20.079,I can't remember the last time you said two words to me that weren't you and suck.
00:26:20.120,00:26:23.623,'Cause I was you-- scared.
00:26:25.751,00:26:27.711,But I got over it.
00:26:38.680,00:26:46.063,"What I realized is that if I'm so willing to eat right to take care of this baby, why am I not willing to do it for myself?"
00:26:47.773,00:26:49.191,You are so lucky.
00:26:50.526,00:26:52.778,You've always been at home in your body.
00:26:59.493,00:27:01.703,I'm so embarrassed.
00:27:03.621,00:27:05.623,This isn't me.
00:27:07.709,00:27:09.627,How did I become this person?
00:27:12.923,00:27:15.008,You are beautiful.
00:27:17.344,00:27:18.887,You know that.
00:27:34.403,00:27:37.072,I don't think this is gonna work out.
00:27:40.742,00:27:44.871,"Want to order a pizza, maybe snuggle up, pop in a movie?"
00:27:44.913,00:27:48.708,I don't think we should make a habit of spending the night together.
00:27:48.750,00:27:50.544,All we did was sleep.
00:27:50.586,00:27:51.711,No. All you did was sleep.
00:27:51.753,00:27:53.755,I was up all night with you kicking me.
00:27:53.797,00:27:56.800,Sorry.
00:27:56.842,00:28:00.179,"Look, I'm in the middle of a divorce, and you..."
00:28:02.764,00:28:05.392,"I mean, being somebody's mistress?"
00:28:26.497,00:28:27.747,You're right.
00:28:27.789,00:28:30.000,You're right.
00:28:31.793,00:28:34.754,"Tonight, I'm gonna go over to Buddy's, and I'm gonna tell him we're through."
00:28:34.796,00:28:37.841,"If he still had the powers of speech, I'm sure he'd be thankful."
00:28:37.883,00:28:41.761,"You know, RinkyDinks loses $8,000 a night."
00:28:56.527,00:29:00.030,"You always give me the right advice, Mr. Schuester."
00:29:00.072,00:29:02.199,See you around.
00:29:11.542,00:29:14.461,"Finn, we need to talk."
00:29:14.503,00:29:16.838,We have to break up our parents immediately.
00:29:18.215,00:29:20.384,I screwed up.
00:29:20.426,00:29:22.969,I feel like the guy who set up Liza and David Gest.
00:29:25.097,00:29:27.849,When I was talking sports with your dad and stuff.
00:29:27.891,00:29:29.602,I could tell that you were...
00:29:29.643,00:29:31.811,Left out?
00:29:31.853,00:29:33.439,Invisible?
00:29:33.480,00:29:34.690,Yeah.
00:29:34.732,00:29:37.984,I don't like that my mom's forgetting about my dad.
00:29:38.026,00:29:43.323,"It's up to me to keep his memory alive, and I don't want to move in with you."
00:29:43.365,00:29:45.784,No offense.
00:29:50.456,00:29:52.958,Agreed.
00:29:57.879,00:29:59.839,What are you doing?
00:29:59.881,00:30:01.800,I'm going to flush Dad's ashes down the toilet.
00:30:03.885,00:30:06.221,Have you lost your mind?!
00:30:06.263,00:30:09.475,What? I'm just doing the same thing you're doing to him.
00:30:09.516,00:30:13.771,What's the point of keeping his remains around if you're just gonna dump them out like an old ashtray?
00:30:13.812,00:30:15.814,Fine.
00:30:17.816,00:30:20.360,What are you doing?
00:30:20.402,00:30:23.781,What we've been doing for the last 15 years-- pretending.
00:30:23.822,00:30:27.242,"Come on, Finn, let's sit and watch TV as a family."
00:30:27.284,00:30:28.744,Look! There's a basketball game on.
00:30:28.786,00:30:30.663,Your dad would've liked to watch that.
00:30:31.913,00:30:32.872,"Mom, you're being crazy."
00:30:32.914,00:30:34.333,And you're being selfish.
00:30:35.208,00:30:38.796,I like Burt. I-I...
00:30:38.837,00:30:41.881,I haven't felt this way about a guy since your dad died.
00:30:41.923,00:30:44.301,At least not one who felt it back.
00:30:44.343,00:30:46.762,This family works. I don't want it to get screwed up!
00:30:48.930,00:30:51.891,We get by.
00:30:51.933,00:30:55.813,You just don't know any differently because you think what we have is normal.
00:31:04.237,00:31:06.865,I do this with him every night.
00:31:08.659,00:31:13.079,"I take the urn to bed with me, and I talk to him about my day."
00:31:13.121,00:31:19.795,"16 years, I've been asking him for advice and..."
00:31:21.672,00:31:25.967,"...and waiting to hear his laugh, and for him to tell me that he loves me."
00:31:28.970,00:31:30.972,And he never does.
00:31:32.224,00:31:33.809,And he never will.
00:31:37.979,00:31:39.981,I won't do it. I'm not moving.
00:31:40.023,00:31:42.442,And he wouldn't want you to do this if I wasn't ready.
00:31:42.484,00:31:45.237,"You didn't know him, Finn."
00:31:48.824,00:31:54.830,"Sweetheart, I love you so much."
00:31:54.872,00:31:58.417,We don't need any more memories or ghosts.
00:32:01.002,00:32:02.838,A home.
00:32:19.938,00:32:23.983,"Well, with a name like Tracy, I assumed you were a lady."
00:32:24.025,00:32:27.780,Quite a turnout for a pep rally.
00:32:27.821,00:32:34.244,"On assembly days, I arrange for the rest of the school to be fumigated, leaving the gymnasium the only place with breathable air."
00:32:34.286,00:32:35.788,"Oh, come on."
00:32:35.829,00:32:37.997,You might want to start writing down my little bon mots.
00:32:38.039,00:32:39.917,I'm gonna be dropping some beauties on you.
00:32:47.340,00:32:50.803,So my cover story isn't a fluff piece?
00:33:04.983,00:33:08.987,Feast your ears on this smokin' intro.
00:33:10.781,00:33:12.658,In a few seconds.
00:33:20.081,00:33:21.875,What is she doing?
00:33:24.920,00:33:25.921,"Hey, guys."
00:33:25.963,00:33:27.965,I'm Mercedes Jones.
00:33:28.799,00:33:36.640,"So most of you know Cheerios! is about perfection and winning, looking hot and being popular."
00:33:36.682,00:33:40.143,Still building the tension.
00:33:42.813,00:33:46.149,"Well, I think that it should be about something different."
00:33:48.610,00:33:51.947,How many of you at this school feel fat?
00:33:54.157,00:33:57.786,How many of you feel like maybe you're not worth very much?
00:33:59.371,00:34:05.168,"Or you're ugly, or you have too many pimples and not enough friends?"
00:34:05.210,00:34:09.088,"Well, I felt all those things about myself at one time or another."
00:34:11.132,00:34:14.761,"Hell, I felt most of those things about myself today."
00:34:14.803,00:34:17.263,And that just ain't right.
00:34:17.305,00:34:20.809,And we've got something to say about it.
00:34:20.851,00:34:25.731,"And if you like what we have to say, come down here and sing it with us."
00:37:07.934,00:37:10.062,We can finish this interview in your office tomorrow.
00:37:14.816,00:37:17.736,Thank you.
00:37:17.777,00:37:20.405,I was wrong.
00:37:27.913,00:37:29.288,"Mr. Pendergrass, let me explain."
00:37:29.330,00:37:30.999,Just have a seat.
00:37:31.041,00:37:35.879,Oh. Not used to taking orders in my own office.
00:37:44.804,00:37:49.684,I came here to write a piece that would expose you as a coward and a cheat.
00:37:49.726,00:37:51.477,I could not have been more wrong.
00:37:53.354,00:38:01.738,"You got every shape and size Cheerio! up there singing about empowerment and inclusion, telling everyone it's okay to be exactly the person you are."
00:38:01.780,00:38:05.951,"You're a visionary, and I think redefining cheerleading."
00:38:05.992,00:38:07.702,Bravo.
00:38:07.744,00:38:10.747,"Well, thank you, uh, Mr. Pendergrass."
00:38:10.789,00:38:13.625,I... I can't say I'm surprised.
00:38:22.383,00:38:23.635,"It's an honor, Coach."
00:38:23.676,00:38:28.056,"When this hits the stands, it could mean big things for you."
00:38:39.400,00:38:41.027,"No, your mom invited me."
00:38:41.069,00:38:43.571,She thought you and I could have a man-to-man.
00:38:43.613,00:38:45.865,"Good, you know, 'cause I got a lot to say about this."
00:38:45.907,00:38:48.827,"Well, I don't, so let me go first."
00:38:48.868,00:38:52.247,"You're pissed, I get it."
00:38:52.289,00:38:59.545,"Your dad is a hero, not only to the world for what he did in Desert Storm, but he's a hero to you."
00:38:59.587,00:39:02.674,No way I can fill his shoes.
00:39:04.717,00:39:06.636,"It's just, you know..."
00:39:06.678,00:39:07.846,I love your mom.
00:39:10.056,00:39:19.774,"She's like this angel that, you know, came down to wake me up after all these years, and I swear to you I will never hurt her, I will always take care of her."
00:39:19.816,00:39:25.363,"And I can't be your dad, but I will be her hero for as long as she'll take me."
00:39:28.449,00:39:29.826,"All right, I've said my piece."
00:39:33.830,00:39:37.876,Just... want to know if you want to watch a game.
00:39:40.879,00:39:43.089,Sure.
00:39:48.178,00:39:49.846,Hold up.
00:39:51.264,00:39:55.101,You can sit here if you want.
00:40:11.701,00:40:13.995,"You know, I hate Duke like I hate the Nazis."
00:40:16.748,00:40:18.250,Tell me about it.
00:40:18.291,00:40:22.254,"This team, every year, they recruit these guys and, uh..."
00:40:31.888,00:40:34.266,I-I don't know what to say.
00:40:34.307,00:40:35.474,Just say congratulations.
00:40:35.516,00:40:36.851,I took your advice.
00:40:36.893,00:40:43.024,"I went home, I told Buddy that if he wanted to keep me around, he had to ditch the old lady and give yours truly the top job."
00:40:46.236,00:40:48.696,One of his eyes went all funny and he had a stroke right in front of me.
00:40:48.738,00:40:50.156,"Geez, April, are you okay?"
00:40:50.198,00:40:51.991,Okay? I'm rich.
00:40:52.033,00:40:57.122,"The ol' battle axe was afraid I'd go to The Lima Times, so she shut me up to the tune of $2 million."
00:40:57.163,00:41:01.084,"So I'm sobering up, and I'm heading to the Broadway, Will."
00:41:01.126,00:41:03.795,I haven't had a drink in 45 minutes.
00:41:03.836,00:41:10.760,I'm going to take my hush money and I'm going to mount the first-ever all-white production of The Wiz.
00:41:10.802,00:41:11.886,Okay.
00:41:11.928,00:41:13.096,And I've got you to thank.
00:41:13.138,00:41:14.931,Did you tell him yet?
00:41:14.973,00:41:15.974,Tell me what?
00:41:16.015,00:41:18.726,That I bought y'all the auditorium.
00:41:19.852,00:41:21.313,What?!
00:41:21.354,00:41:23.898,I wrote ol' Figgins a check this morning.
00:41:23.940,00:41:27.026,It's now called the April Rhodes Civic Pavilion.
00:41:27.068,00:41:30.447,I... I don't know what to say.
00:41:30.488,00:41:31.948,APRIL: We've got that covered.
00:00:03.086,00:00:06.423,So here's what's happened on Glee: Jesse left Vocal Adrenaline...
00:00:06.465,00:00:08.509,You can learn from me.
00:00:06.465,00:00:10.260,"...so he could date Rachel, so now he's part of the glee club."
00:00:10.302,00:00:11.679,And they're the new power couple.
00:00:11.720,00:00:13.221,Previous power couples: Rachel and Finn...
00:00:13.263,00:00:15.140,I made us his and her relationship calendars.
00:00:15.182,00:00:16.642,Oh.
00:00:16.684,00:00:18.352,Want to make out?
00:00:19.687,00:00:21.104,Will still has a crush on Emma...
00:00:21.146,00:00:23.482,I could just lean over and kiss you if I want to. And I want to.
00:00:23.524,00:00:27.110,"But he hasn't divorced Terri yet, and he made out with the coach of Vocal Adrenaline."
00:00:27.152,00:00:29.363,Most of the show choir directors I make out with are gay.
00:00:32.616,00:00:34.117,Still just kind of angry about everything.
00:00:34.159,00:00:35.911,SUE: Who wants a piece of it? Huh?
00:00:35.953,00:00:38.998,And that's what you missed on Glee.
00:00:45.128,00:00:46.714,What's so funny?
00:00:46.755,00:00:50.926,"You guys aren't watching the video of me falling off stage at my first TinyTots beauty pageant, are you?"
00:00:50.968,00:00:53.387,That was Carrot Top funny compared to this comedic tour de force.
00:00:53.428,00:00:56.097,JESSIE: That's Olivia Newton-John's Physical.
00:00:56.139,00:01:00.936,"It was pretty groundbreaking subject matter at the time, considering it's depiction of fluid sexuality."
00:01:00.978,00:01:02.145,"MERCEDES: Oh, my good..."
00:01:02.187,00:01:04.356,"Wait, wait."
00:01:04.398,00:01:05.733,That's not Olivia Newton-John.
00:01:05.774,00:01:08.109,"That's, that's Sue Sylvester."
00:01:09.528,00:01:18.119,I can tell you that I certainly did not steal it from her locked file cabinet yesterday when she sent me back to her office to get her hormone replacement injection during Cheerios!
00:01:19.663,00:01:22.332,"Wait, did she just do the Cabbage Patch?"
00:01:24.167,00:01:25.293,I'm posting this on YouTube.
00:01:25.335,00:01:26.294,"RACHEL: No, no, wait, wait."
00:01:26.336,00:01:27.295,Do you think that's a good idea?
00:01:29.172,00:01:32.801,"Oh, let her get a taste of some of the humiliation she put us through."
00:01:39.182,00:01:42.519,Ten bucks it goes viral by lunch.
00:01:46.105,00:01:48.734,"Hey, Ms. Sylvester."
00:01:48.776,00:01:50.027,Let's get physical.
00:01:50.069,00:01:52.738,"Not really my type, but I like that attitude."
00:01:52.780,00:01:54.073,"Hey, Sue!"
00:01:54.114,00:01:56.116,Let's get animal!
00:02:01.663,00:02:05.793,That glee club stole my private property and posted it online.
00:02:05.834,00:02:09.170,"And as soon as I figure out the difference between slander and libel, I'm filing a lawsuit."
00:02:12.132,00:02:15.844,"Will, I may buy a small diaper for your chin, because it looks like a baby's ass."
00:02:15.886,00:02:19.347,"That video has received over 170,000 comments."
00:02:19.389,00:02:22.434,I took the liberty of printing out a few.
00:02:22.476,00:02:26.981,The man in this video looks like the champion cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester.
00:02:27.022,00:02:28.607,That was particularly hurtful.
00:02:28.649,00:02:32.235,"You know, Sue, there are a lot of people at this school who dislike you."
00:02:32.277,00:02:33.695,My kids don't do stuff like this.
00:02:33.737,00:02:34.822,Is that so?
00:02:34.863,00:02:37.741,Exhibit B.
00:02:38.826,00:02:40.494,What's a Glist?
00:02:40.535,00:02:42.037,It's the Glee List William.
00:02:42.079,00:02:45.791,"It's a weekly ranking of your glee club, based on a hotness quotient of sexual promiscuity."
00:02:45.833,00:02:48.376,It was posted all over the school an hour ago.
00:02:51.713,00:02:54.675,What makes you think my kids did this?
00:02:54.716,00:02:58.846,This Glist was made on a library computer using the pass code gleeclub.
00:02:58.887,00:03:02.141,Your glee club is a petri dish of sexual depravity.
00:03:02.181,00:03:03.433,"Sue's right, Will."
00:03:03.475,00:03:08.147,"Why, only last year, a list was posted ranking McKinley's ten ugliest Gingers."
00:03:08.229,00:03:12.651,And the perpetrator would have been expelled had it not turned out to be a member of the faculty!
00:03:14.277,00:03:15.529,"William, this is serious."
00:03:15.570,00:03:20.492,I cannot have an environment that sexualizes children and damages their self-esteem!
00:03:30.293,00:03:34.464,But now I know the white-hot shame of public rebuke-- that pain is indescribable.
00:03:34.506,00:03:40.303,"William, last year, at West Dayton High, a photo circulated of school superintendent..."
00:03:44.307,00:03:45.475,The entire school!
00:03:45.517,00:03:47.102,"The entire school was expelled, will!"
00:03:47.144,00:03:48.562,What does that have to do with me?
00:03:48.603,00:03:55.152,"You must find out who made the Glist and suspend them before they post another one, or I'm holding the entire glee club responsible!"
00:03:55.194,00:03:56.361,Are you serious?
00:03:58.155,00:04:00.074,I cannot have these shenanigans at this school!
00:04:00.115,00:04:09.374,He cannot have these shenanigans at this school!
00:04:09.416,00:04:12.169,Who did it?
00:04:12.920,00:04:14.213,This is serious.
00:04:14.254,00:04:16.464,Principal Figgins is threatening to disband the club.
00:04:18.050,00:04:19.342,We all know it was Puck.
00:04:19.384,00:04:21.220,Back off.
00:04:21.261,00:04:23.138,Then why is your girlfriend first on the Glist?
00:04:23.180,00:04:24.472,And why am I last?
00:04:30.353,00:04:31.813,"Puck, seriously, did you do it?"
00:04:31.855,00:04:33.023,I said no.
00:04:34.357,00:04:37.027,I like setting stuff on fire and beating up people I don't know.
00:04:37.069,00:04:38.737,I own that.
00:04:38.779,00:04:40.906,"All right, here's the important point."
00:04:40.948,00:04:47.246,"Between this and posting Coach Sylvester's personal video on YouTube, you guys are getting a pretty bad reputation."
00:04:47.287,00:04:48.956,Why is that a bad thing?
00:04:48.997,00:04:52.834,"Maybe if we seem more dangerous, people would stop flushing my glasses down the toilet."
00:04:52.876,00:04:54.962,"Look, things are hard right now."
00:04:55.003,00:04:57.547,You're under a lot of pressure with regionals coming up.
00:05:02.385,00:05:06.389,But becoming what you despise is not the answer.
00:05:14.397,00:05:18.359,"And, like you guys, it's time to start rehabilitating its bad reputation."
00:05:26.409,00:05:30.247,"And then, hopefully, can apply this musical lesson to your own lives."
00:05:30.289,00:05:32.666,This song should be arrested for the crime of sucking.
00:05:35.127,00:05:37.378,"Oh, no, he didn't."
00:05:37.420,00:05:38.713,Hit it.
00:06:25.719,00:06:28.429,Verse two!
00:07:18.188,00:07:19.273,"Yo, man, let's get out of here."
00:07:19.314,00:07:21.316,Word to your mother.
00:07:22.525,00:07:24.361,This song is officially paroled!
00:07:25.404,00:07:26.487,"Right, Jessie?"
00:07:26.529,00:07:27.697,You got me?
00:07:33.578,00:07:37.540,SUE: This is not happening.
00:07:41.420,00:07:44.172,You're Sue Sylvester-- legend.
00:07:48.176,00:07:52.555,Just calmly pour yourself a cup of joe and focus.
00:07:52.597,00:07:54.808,"Wait, what's that smell?"
00:07:54.849,00:07:57.352,"Dear God, that's coffee."
00:07:57.394,00:07:59.229,It's usually masked by the smell of fear.
00:08:02.565,00:08:08.447,You're being laughed at in slow motion by a roomful of inferiors whom you used to terrify.
00:08:12.575,00:08:13.910,Brenda Castle.
00:08:16.871,00:08:24.504,I can't teach in Indiana anymore 'cause I have some drug problems that ended up involving some of my shoot-ins.
00:08:25.588,00:08:27.882,I saw your video.
00:08:29.176,00:08:31.761,"And you, my friend, are an embarrassment."
00:08:42.647,00:08:44.565,I need to enlist the services of the A/V Club.
00:08:44.607,00:08:45.859,What did you have in mind?
00:08:45.900,00:08:50.822,My shame at appearing so low on the Glist has made me reevaluate my image at this school and beyond.
00:08:50.864,00:08:57.412,"I've now realized that in today's culture of bad boy athletes and celebrity sex tapes, a good reputation is no good at all."
00:08:57.454,00:09:02.250,"Artie, you know how our Glee Club assignment was to find a song with a bad reputation and rehabilitate it?"
00:09:02.292,00:09:05.879,"Well, mine is going to afford me the worst reputation in this school."
00:09:05.920,00:09:08.882,Rachel Berry is going to get a little down and dirty.
00:09:08.923,00:09:10.091,I'm going to stop you.
00:09:10.133,00:09:11.551,You had me at sex tape.
00:09:12.135,00:09:13.094,How can I help?
00:09:13.136,00:09:19.434,"Hold onto your hat, because Rachel Berry is going to become musically promiscuous."
00:09:30.862,00:09:33.907,We're such zeros they didn't even bother putting us on the Glist.
00:09:45.168,00:09:46.586,Why is she here?
00:09:50.298,00:09:56.555,"I had a cold, and I took all my antibiotics at the same time, and now I can't remember how to leave."
00:09:56.596,00:09:59.891,But I also don't know why I've only made fourth on the Glist.
00:10:02.685,00:10:04.854,"Girls, boys, Mr. Kidney the janitor."
00:10:04.896,00:10:08.233,I need to do something to get into the top three.
00:10:08.275,00:10:10.110,"Fine, you're in."
00:10:10.151,00:10:11.819,We don't even have a plan.
00:10:14.989,00:10:16.157,Eat in the cafeteria?
00:10:19.536,00:10:22.830,And I'm not talking about trying to check out a reference book.
00:10:22.872,00:10:24.291,Mm-mm.
00:10:24.332,00:10:29.129,I'm talking about full-on chaos-- including getting your Glee on in the stacks.
00:10:41.724,00:10:43.684,Boy...
00:10:43.726,00:10:45.979,"Jean, I'm so sorry you ever felt that way."
00:10:46.020,00:10:48.315,I'm sorry I didn't protect you more.
00:10:48.356,00:10:50.525,"Remember what we used to do, Sue?"
00:10:50.567,00:10:56.573,"Whenever I got sad, we'd help at the animal shelter, to give back."
00:11:03.330,00:11:05.624,I'm a little confused.
00:11:05.665,00:11:07.000,I understand.
00:11:07.041,00:11:12.797,"You're probably wondering, what exactly does Sue Sylvester mean when she says, I'm your new therapist?"
00:11:12.839,00:11:14.715,"Well, let me explain."
00:11:14.757,00:11:19.720,"As you may or may not know, I star in a little music video that's been circulating around the Web."
00:11:19.762,00:11:22.516,"A video that has a tendency to induce cruel, slow-motion laughter."
00:11:22.557,00:11:24.017,"No, no, didn't-didn't know about that."
00:11:24.058,00:11:28.438,"Well, this video has inspired Sue Sylvester to start giving back."
00:11:28.480,00:11:38.781,"I happen to have my Masters in counseling, and when I heard that our school district's one and only psychologist had committed suicide, well, I decided to volunteer my services."
00:11:40.241,00:11:41.742,I'd really like to help.
00:11:41.784,00:11:44.329,I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about this.
00:11:44.371,00:11:46.039,"Ella, you're crippled by mental illness."
00:11:46.080,00:11:49.543,Your compulsions have estranged you from your own feelings.
00:11:49.584,00:11:52.753,You nearly married a gym teacher who's more gravy than man.
00:11:52.795,00:11:58.176,And you're content to be repeatedly lied to by the man you purport to love.
00:11:58.218,00:12:02.930,"I bribed Will Schuester's landlord to slip baby monitors under his couch, and under his bed."
00:12:02.972,00:12:11.648,"Turns out he's been having make out sessions with the coach from Vocal Adrenaline, and sleepovers with that world-class banana magnet April Rhodes."
00:12:11.690,00:12:13.066,You need to make a bold move.
00:12:17.445,00:12:18.655,Excuse me?
00:12:23.826,00:12:25.786,You make a valid point.
00:12:25.828,00:12:27.622,Grow a pair.
00:12:27.664,00:12:32.085,"You refuse to stand up for yourself, you're so afraid of confrontation."
00:12:32.126,00:12:33.211,You're right.
00:12:33.253,00:12:36.797,"If you want to get better, you need to start communicating your feelings."
00:12:36.839,00:12:43.804,"You need to let Will Schuester know how he's made you feel, and in a public setting, so he can't escape, and he won't manipulate you."
00:12:43.846,00:12:47.225,Trust me-- you need to let him have it.
00:12:47.267,00:12:51.812,"RACHEL: Do you know that when we dated, the rest of the school gave us a nickname?"
00:12:51.854,00:12:53.481,Puckleberry.
00:12:53.523,00:12:54.733,That's humiliating.
00:12:59.279,00:13:02.240,It gave you a sense of humanity.
00:13:02.282,00:13:04.325,Wait-- do you want to date again?
00:13:04.367,00:13:06.453,I was wondering why you invited me here.
00:13:09.872,00:13:16.671,"Help me with my song for Glee Club. I might be the last chance you have to salvage what's left of your reputation, and stay in Glee."
00:13:19.882,00:13:21.842,So what song do you want to do for your assignment?
00:13:21.884,00:13:26.847,I've chosen David Geddes' fantastically terrible '70s top ten hit-- Run Joey Run.
00:13:26.889,00:13:28.849,It's a story song.
00:13:30.351,00:13:34.897,"I'm going to play the role of the tragic heroine who dies in the end, Ã¡ la Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge."
00:13:36.899,00:13:38.025,Do I get to kill you?
00:13:38.067,00:13:40.861,"Actually, my dad shoots me with a shotgun."
00:13:45.908,00:13:48.286,"Well, it does sound like something that you would do."
00:13:48.328,00:13:51.914,"God, I'm so tired of people judging me for a few mistakes I've made."
00:13:51.956,00:13:53.792,I try to be a good guy.
00:13:53.832,00:13:57.086,"I go to school and I say, Be cool, Puck. Be nice."
00:13:57.128,00:14:03.510,"But by second period, I've got a fire extinguisher in my hands and I'm spraying some dweeb with it and I don't know how I got there."
00:14:05.928,00:14:18.899,I sit in Glee Club and I watch a couple of imperfect performances and a litany of criticisms just start building up inside of me like a volcano and I keep telling myself to hold it in and then it just comes bursting out.
00:14:18.941,00:14:23.530,"Granted, generally I'm right, but doesn't do much for my reputation."
00:14:23.571,00:14:25.573,It does suck when you do that.
00:14:30.244,00:14:35.542,"So, uh, how do you think we can get people to see us differently?"
00:14:35.583,00:14:38.211,I don't know.
00:14:40.839,00:14:43.758,I can't-- I can't do this.
00:14:43.800,00:14:49.930,"You know, whoever made that Glist is going to put you at number one when they find out you cheated on that Jessie kid with me."
00:14:49.972,00:14:53.893,"Besides, Jessie will never fully understand what it means to be a Jew."
00:14:56.604,00:14:58.523,Noah...
00:15:02.985,00:15:04.821,"All right, I'm out."
00:15:04.863,00:15:07.240,Why should I stay if there's no chance of us making out?
00:15:11.994,00:15:13.954,"Okay, it'll help us both."
00:15:13.996,00:15:15.998,I promise.
00:15:21.003,00:15:22.422,Are you sure this is a good idea?
00:15:22.463,00:15:23.964,Stop thinking about him and do it for yourself.
00:15:27.093,00:15:29.011,"Nah, can't go in the teacher's lounge."
00:15:29.053,00:15:31.681,"Lots of cruel, slow-motion laughter going on in there."
00:15:31.723,00:15:33.850,"Well, look who it is."
00:15:33.892,00:15:35.852,I thought I smelled a laughingstock.
00:15:35.894,00:15:38.605,"Don't start with me Castle, or I will kick you square in the taco."
00:15:38.646,00:15:40.022,It's a date.
00:15:40.064,00:15:43.818,That's just a typical Saturday night in the Castle condo.
00:15:51.117,00:15:52.034,Go get 'em.
00:15:52.076,00:15:55.121,Some days you...
00:15:56.038,00:15:57.957,That's okay.
00:15:59.542,00:16:01.502,Excuse me.
00:16:05.465,00:16:06.800,Actually no.
00:16:09.051,00:16:12.179,You're just going to have to reschedule your heavy petting session with Mrs. Carlisle for a later time.
00:16:12.221,00:16:13.389,Emma!
00:16:13.431,00:16:15.892,I beg your pardon?
00:16:15.934,00:16:20.814,I was just telling Mr. Schuester about how my husband recently died.
00:16:20.855,00:16:22.106,Wow.
00:16:22.148,00:16:25.109,"Getting them fresh off the rebound now, aren't you?"
00:16:25.151,00:16:28.028,Amazing. Nobody's safe.
00:16:28.070,00:16:30.448,"Emma, can I talk to you in private?"
00:16:34.076,00:16:36.663,"Actually, did you know I was seeing a therapist?"
00:16:36.704,00:16:40.082,Do you know that? Did you know I've been trying to work through my OCD so I could be with you?
00:16:42.168,00:16:43.711,It's not fun; it's absolutely humiliating.
00:16:43.753,00:16:49.133,"And come to find out you've been fooling around with some woman named Shelby, and you slept with April Rhodes."
00:16:49.175,00:16:51.636,How did you find out about that?
00:16:51.678,00:16:52.971,You're not denying it.
00:16:54.305,00:16:55.974,"See, I thought we were trying to work through this."
00:16:56.015,00:17:00.227,"I thought when you said you were trying to figure out things on your own, I thought you meant that."
00:17:00.269,00:17:02.563,I'm not going to stand for this anymore.
00:17:02.605,00:17:06.192,"I'm not. I'm putting my foot down, and I am finally sticking up for myself."
00:17:07.109,00:17:08.778,"You're a slut, Will."
00:17:09.529,00:17:10.738,You're a slut.
00:17:10.780,00:17:13.073,"You're a slut, you're a slut, you're a slut."
00:17:13.115,00:17:14.868,Everybody should know that.
00:17:14.909,00:17:17.203,And you should know that I'm through with you.
00:17:20.122,00:17:21.958,I'm very sorry for your loss.
00:17:38.140,00:17:40.727,"Looks like we got a full house, y'all."
00:17:40.768,00:17:42.311,I'm kind of getting cold feet here.
00:17:42.353,00:17:43.479,Can you even feel your feet?
00:17:43.521,00:17:44.605,Shh!
00:17:45.773,00:17:47.107,"Team, listen up."
00:17:47.149,00:17:49.485,"If we pull this off, we will be legends at this school."
00:17:49.527,00:17:51.029,We'll rocket up the Glist.
00:17:51.070,00:17:52.488,"We will be top-five, easy."
00:17:52.530,00:17:54.032,"Artie, pump up the jam."
00:17:54.073,00:17:56.075,It's about to go down.
00:18:01.163,00:18:02.415,You can't touch this.
00:19:12.026,00:19:13.152,Here it comes.
00:19:16.280,00:19:17.824,That was very cute.
00:19:17.865,00:19:25.456,I'm gonna talk to my pastor and see if I can't get you kids to perform that for our Sunday service.
00:19:36.258,00:19:37.885,And I can't let that happen.
00:19:37.927,00:19:42.431,"Look, I know I've been kind of angry lately, and sometimes I kick over chairs and stuff, but I didn't do it."
00:19:42.473,00:19:44.934,"All the pieces fit, Finn."
00:19:46.310,00:19:53.860,"Quinn broke your heart, Puck betrayed your friendship, you're dealing with Kurt's dad dating your mom, and I happen to know you've had your ups and downs with Santana and Brittany..."
00:19:53.901,00:19:55.903,"I have nothing against Santana, and I like Brittany."
00:19:55.945,00:19:57.530,Quinn's the one who has a beef with them.
00:20:00.282,00:20:02.618,Isn't it true that you still feel like an outcast in that group?
00:20:02.660,00:20:03.661,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:20:03.703,00:20:05.163,I like being a Cheerio.
00:20:05.204,00:20:07.331,And why does everyone just assume I'm angry all the time?
00:20:11.919,00:20:15.548,"The Glists are posted at a height of five and a half feet, comfortably out of my reach."
00:20:15.589,00:20:17.091,And I have it on good word that...
00:20:17.133,00:20:19.760,I saw Puck putting up the Glist in the hallway.
00:20:19.802,00:20:21.888,"Somebody put it up on Rachel's locker, so I moved it."
00:20:27.309,00:20:28.978,"If I did it, why would I put myself at number three?"
00:20:29.020,00:20:30.771,"As far as bad-asses go, I'm number wha."
00:20:34.316,00:20:35.359,Rachel did it.
00:20:35.401,00:20:40.489,"Think about it: I stole the guy she's in love with, then I stole the guy she dated to get over the guy she's in love with."
00:20:40.531,00:20:43.117,And I'm kind of a bitch to her.
00:20:45.327,00:20:48.081,"And I mean, who's to say that there's only one culprit?"
00:20:48.122,00:20:49.665,"Look, I know you know something!"
00:20:49.707,00:20:51.751,So we're not leaving here until I get some answers.
00:20:51.792,00:20:54.712,"Mr. Schuester, may I be blunt?"
00:20:59.341,00:21:05.598,"Ever since you separated from your wife, you've spent a lot of late nights watching reruns of Law and Order, haven't you?"
00:21:05.639,00:21:08.809,Hmm. Thought so.
00:21:08.851,00:21:10.895,"And no, I didn't make the Glist."
00:21:12.354,00:21:13.940,Right.
00:21:19.361,00:21:23.241,Which means our squeaky-clean reputations are still very much intact.
00:21:31.373,00:21:33.251,But we'll get suspended.
00:21:33.292,00:21:34.418,And it will be worth it.
00:21:48.390,00:21:51.560,The video has just surpassed three million hits.
00:21:51.602,00:21:56.523,Is my misery some kind of karmic retribution for the way I've treated people?
00:22:02.613,00:22:04.198,You're go for Sue.
00:22:04.240,00:22:05.658,Hello? Sue?
00:22:05.699,00:22:10.997,"It's Olivia Newton-John, star of Grease-- the most successful movie musical of all time."
00:22:11.038,00:22:14.583,Nice try.
00:22:14.625,00:22:16.043,Uh...
00:22:16.085,00:22:19.297,"Journal, I've learned my lesson."
00:22:31.433,00:22:34.312,"Hi! Uh, we must have been cut off."
00:22:34.352,00:22:35.562,It's Olivia Newton-John.
00:22:35.604,00:22:38.691,I released a record seven-consecutive number one singles.
00:22:44.030,00:22:47.700,That song was the best-selling record of the '80s.
00:22:47.741,00:22:58.836,"Listen, Sue, I'm headed for a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a sanctuary for orphaned koalas, but I heard my daughter Chloe laughing at something on the Internet the other day, and I saw your video."
00:22:58.878,00:23:03.924,"And I just have to ask, whatever would possess a person to do something like that?"
00:23:03.966,00:23:08.346,"Well, I gotta tell you, Olivia, that video was never meant for public consumption."
00:23:08.386,00:23:12.350,Some people enjoy videotaping themselves being intimate with a partner.
00:23:12.390,00:23:16.937,I happen to enjoy revisiting the impeccable form of my various jazzercise routines.
00:23:18.480,00:23:20.649,"You know, that song was the biggest hit of my career."
00:23:20.691,00:23:23.069,Physical spent ten weeks at number one.
00:23:23.110,00:23:24.111,It's a classic.
00:23:24.153,00:23:25.445,I agree.
00:23:25.487,00:23:31.244,"Unfortunately, I botched the video, which, by the way, was one of the first music videos ever."
00:23:31.285,00:23:36.456,"But I filled it with obese guys in spandex, and it went over the top, and the song went with it."
00:23:36.498,00:23:41.879,"But I saw your YouTube video, Sue, and I realized that now is the time to save it-- and possibly you."
00:23:41.921,00:23:46.466,I'll be in Ohio tomorrow chairing a benefit for Save the Rainforests at King's Island.
00:23:46.508,00:23:49.511,I don't understand.
00:23:55.601,00:23:57.728,"Hey, man-whore."
00:23:59.021,00:24:00.398,Will Schuester?
00:24:00.480,00:24:02.316,I'm Brenda Castle.
00:24:02.358,00:24:04.568,I'm the new astronomy teacher and badminton coach.
00:24:04.610,00:24:08.781,"I also happen to be an alcoholic, and... I like pills."
00:24:10.532,00:24:12.410,Let's go in this classroom and pork!
00:24:12.450,00:24:13.619,No.
00:24:15.829,00:24:17.415,"I am praying for you, William."
00:24:17.455,00:24:20.126,We've all heard about your gallivanting!
00:24:20.167,00:24:22.169,But nothing happened!
00:24:22.211,00:24:23.796,"Maybe that's not what matters, Will."
00:24:23.837,00:24:27.341,You broke the heart of somebody who doesn't let people get close to her.
00:24:27.383,00:24:28.550,I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
00:24:28.592,00:24:34.140,"You probably didn't mean to hurt me, either, but lately I've been feeding my feelings to the tune of 6,000 calories a day."
00:24:36.392,00:24:37.475,Slut.
00:24:44.566,00:24:49.196,"Remember-- if Sylvester hits you in the face after you cop to posting the video, don't scream like a woman."
00:24:49.238,00:24:50.906,"You're so brave for doing this, Kurt."
00:24:50.948,00:24:53.242,I know. Thank you.
00:24:53.284,00:24:55.035,"Oh, my God..."
00:25:02.168,00:25:05.379,"Coach Sylvester, can I have just a minute of your time?"
00:25:05.421,00:25:06.797,"What do you want, ladyface?"
00:25:12.594,00:25:14.638,We stole the tape from your syringe-and-pill drawer.
00:25:14.680,00:25:16.056,We posted it online.
00:25:16.098,00:25:18.058,We'll accept whatever punishment you see fit.
00:25:18.100,00:25:20.019,So it was you.
00:25:21.187,00:25:23.605,I can't thank you enough.
00:25:28.610,00:25:30.446,ARTIE: She wasn't angry at all.
00:25:30.488,00:25:31.655,It was weird.
00:25:31.697,00:25:35.575,"Maybe the comments online have gotten so mean, people have started to feel sorry for her."
00:25:35.617,00:25:38.871,"She's finally getting some sympathy, so she's in a forgiving mood."
00:25:38.912,00:25:40.164,Wait a second.
00:25:40.206,00:25:41.665,Take a look at this.
00:28:00.137,00:28:01.888,MERCEDES: Whew!
00:28:01.930,00:28:03.932,Yeah.
00:28:03.974,00:28:05.767,Yeah.
00:28:05.809,00:28:06.726,All day.
00:28:07.936,00:28:10.939,"WILL: All right, guys, listen up."
00:28:10.981,00:28:13.192,Another week has almost passed.
00:28:13.233,00:28:19.823,"If a list goes up again later today, this issue is out of my hands, and it becomes Principal Figgins' jurisdiction."
00:28:19.865,00:28:22.951,"Seriously, Mr. Shue, whoever made that list is not gonna come forward."
00:28:22.993,00:28:25.703,We might as well just bend over and take whatever's coming.
00:28:31.793,00:28:32.752,Okay.
00:28:32.794,00:28:34.129,"Well, then, uh, let's get to it."
00:28:34.171,00:28:37.508,"Rachel, how about you show us your bad reputation project?"
00:28:38.800,00:28:40.636,I'd like to say a few words first.
00:28:47.809,00:28:52.356,I expect that this video will go over some of the heads of our less-cultured teammates.
00:28:56.818,00:28:58.737,"Lights. Okay, go."
00:30:26.742,00:32:07.384,"JESSIE: Well, why don't we just, um, take a moment to really absorb what we've just watched."
00:32:07.426,00:32:08.844,This is garbage!
00:32:08.886,00:32:10.970,"No, he's right."
00:32:08.886,00:32:14.015,"First of all, I need to trust my instincts more because I had a feeling when we were shooting that, that it was not going to be good."
00:32:16.101,00:32:17.644,I thought you and I were going out.
00:32:17.686,00:32:20.606,Being triple-cast with two other guys to play opposite your girlfriend?
00:32:20.647,00:32:21.815,It's mortifying.
00:32:21.857,00:32:23.066,It was an artistic statement.
00:32:23.108,00:32:24.902,FINN: No. it wasn't!
00:32:37.038,00:32:39.499,Is your stupid reputation more important than your relationships?
00:32:42.753,00:32:44.045,"Jessie, wait!"
00:32:54.473,00:32:56.516,"JEAN: I saw your video, Sue!"
00:32:56.558,00:32:58.852,"You know, I have to thank you, Jean."
00:32:58.894,00:33:02.105,You always know exactly what to say to me when I lose my way.
00:33:02.147,00:33:04.858,Turns out all I needed was an attitude change.
00:33:04.900,00:33:07.527,I forgot how good it feels to give back.
00:33:07.569,00:33:14.284,"I've spent so much time worrying about what other people thought about me, when there's really only one person in the world I want to impress."
00:33:14.326,00:33:15.327,Who?
00:33:15.368,00:33:17.036,"Who? You, silly."
00:33:17.078,00:33:30.258,"So, yesterday, I walked back into that teachers' lounge, and I calmly informed them of my unlikely skyrocket to showbiz fame, and very gently told them all I just didn't care what they thought about me."
00:33:30.300,00:33:32.511,"What's that? Oh, look."
00:33:32.552,00:33:35.681,"Sue Sylvester is a top 700 recording artist, people!"
00:33:46.107,00:33:47.526,It's not going to be much.
00:33:47.567,00:33:49.361,Olivia totally screwed me in negotiations.
00:33:49.402,00:33:54.700,"I won't be working with her again, but it should be enough for a couple of benches out back for the summer."
00:33:54.741,00:33:57.285,Maybe a little vegetable garden for you to putter around in.
00:33:59.120,00:34:00.580,Yeah.
00:34:00.622,00:34:05.335,"Now, after all these years, how is it that you still know so much more about everything than I do?"
00:34:05.377,00:34:06.753,I'm the smart one.
00:34:09.130,00:34:10.089,How is that fair?
00:34:10.131,00:34:11.591,"Ah, thank you."
00:34:14.135,00:34:15.387,Okay.
00:34:15.428,00:34:16.763,See that-- the two little bears?
00:34:16.805,00:34:18.097,That's you and I.
00:34:18.139,00:34:20.099,"I'm the big one, right?"
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.142,"Yeah, you're the tiny one."
00:34:21.184,00:34:22.185,And what does that say?
00:34:22.227,00:34:23.729,I always love you.
00:34:23.770,00:34:26.398,And I will always love you.
00:34:34.406,00:34:36.074,Hey.
00:34:38.535,00:34:40.620,"Uh, these are for you."
00:34:44.165,00:34:45.542,They're lovely.
00:34:45.584,00:34:47.085,Thank you.
00:34:54.009,00:35:00.849,"I think, in all of this discovering who I am business, I took a couple of wrong turns."
00:35:05.437,00:35:11.693,But now I know that that's not who I am or who I want to be.
00:35:12.694,00:35:15.030,I know what's supposed to happen now.
00:35:24.915,00:35:26.666,I can't.
00:35:28.085,00:35:30.796,"But, Emily, th-this is..."
00:35:30.837,00:35:32.422,I just...
00:35:34.925,00:35:37.427,I want you to look at me the way you used to.
00:35:40.221,00:35:42.432,I can't.
00:35:44.267,00:35:46.185,"But you know what, that's a good thing."
00:35:46.227,00:35:52.150,"Really, if this relationship is ever going to work between the two of us, we have to start seeing each other for who we really are."
00:35:55.528,00:35:57.489,Thank you for the flowers.
00:36:20.971,00:36:22.430,I know you're behind the Glist.
00:36:22.472,00:36:24.223,You have no proof.
00:36:22.472,00:36:26.810,I can't believe that you're going to pin this on me. I'll be expelled.
00:36:26.852,00:36:28.227,"I mean, it makes sense."
00:36:28.269,00:36:32.607,"Everything else has been taken from me-- my popularity, my body."
00:36:32.649,00:36:34.943,Might as well throw away my education.
00:36:34.985,00:36:36.695,You know when I realized that you did it?
00:36:37.737,00:36:40.866,The moment I felt what it was like to walk in your shoes.
00:36:40.907,00:36:44.911,"I mean, it takes years to build a good reputation, but only seconds to destroy it."
00:36:46.163,00:36:49.875,"Couple bad choices, and you go from the top to the bottom."
00:36:53.795,00:36:56.339,"You have lost so much, Quinn."
00:36:57.924,00:37:00.218,Which means you had the most to gain from the Glist.
00:37:02.971,00:37:05.223,I never meant to hurt anybody.
00:37:06.558,00:37:11.646,"I... I was captain of the cheerleading squad, president of the Celibacy Club."
00:37:11.688,00:37:13.190,I had Finn.
00:37:13.231,00:37:17.944,People would part like the Red Sea when I walked down the hallway.
00:37:17.986,00:37:19.362,Now I'm invisible.
00:37:19.404,00:37:22.199,And you think being seen as a cheap tramp is better?
00:37:22.240,00:37:25.410,A bad reputation is better than no reputation at all.
00:37:26.494,00:37:30.582,"Look, I know that high school feels like your whole life right now, but it's going to end."
00:37:30.623,00:37:38.423,"You're going to give that baby to a family who really wants it, who's going to love it, and then you are going to go on to do amazing things, Quinn."
00:37:39.925,00:37:42.719,You really think that I can get it all back one day?
00:37:48.058,00:37:49.267,No.
00:37:53.605,00:37:55.481,"I mean, come on."
00:37:55.523,00:38:00.153,"I mean, those people didn't part when you walked down the halls; you moved them with your attitude."
00:38:01.362,00:38:02.864,"Thanks, Mr. Shue."
00:38:04.199,00:38:07.827,You're a really good teacher-- even if everybody is calling you a man-whore.
00:38:07.869,00:38:09.746,"FIGGINS: You wanted to see me, William?"
00:38:09.788,00:38:13.750,I trust you have come up with the perpetrators of the Glist.
00:38:20.465,00:38:22.175,No one copped to making the Glist.
00:38:22.217,00:38:25.344,They all closed ranks and wouldn't rat out who did it.
00:38:25.386,00:38:26.972,"That's poppycock, Will."
00:38:27.013,00:38:31.184,I will not let this school be held hostage by juvenile shenanigans.
00:38:31.226,00:38:33.979,"I know, but... I mean, your point has been made."
00:38:34.020,00:38:35.354,The Glists have stopped.
00:38:35.396,00:38:38.608,I think we should just call this a victory and move on.
00:38:43.404,00:38:44.990,Fine.
00:38:45.031,00:38:47.325,"I'm still praying for you, Will."
00:38:54.415,00:38:55.834,Thank you.
00:39:04.843,00:39:06.803,Hi.
00:39:13.434,00:39:16.021,Most of them had no idea who you were.
00:39:16.062,00:39:24.029,"The ones that did said you were kind of sneaky hot, but that that quality was canceled out by a compulsive need to be right and a strange affinity for sweaters with animals on them."
00:39:25.446,00:39:30.035,"that, even though no one particularly liked you, they all said you were a person who could be trusted."
00:39:31.369,00:39:34.706,"I have this pathological need to be popular, okay?"
00:39:34.747,00:39:40.253,I... I just want people to think I'm cool so bad sometimes that it just clouds my judgment. Okay?
00:39:41.713,00:39:43.006,I'm sure you can understand that.
00:39:43.048,00:39:44.423,"On that level, sure."
00:39:49.470,00:39:51.306,"I should have been enough for you, Rachel."
00:39:53.516,00:39:55.476,I knew you'd break my heart.
00:39:58.146,00:40:00.857,"Well, that's the funny thing about reputations."
00:40:00.899,00:40:05.653,"Everyone thinks I'm the big heartbreaker, but the fact of the matter is..."
00:40:05.695,00:40:07.947,you broke mine first.
00:40:11.326,00:40:12.702,Do me a favor.
00:40:18.375,00:40:19.667,Don't talk to me.
00:00:02.294,00:00:05.547,"So here's what happened last week: Kurt found a video of Sue, and the glee club posted it online."
00:00:07.257,00:00:15.641,"Then somebody made a glist of who in the glee club was the naughtiest, so Rachel tried to seem like a bad girl by doing a video with Finn, Puck and Jessie, but mostly it just hurt their feelings and the song was really, really bad."
00:00:15.683,00:00:17.267,Like maybe the worst song ever written.
00:00:23.106,00:00:24.191,And that's what you missed on Glee.
00:01:03.230,00:01:04.690,Who is that guy?
00:01:12.155,00:01:16.117,She started crying about sun block and how she's always telling me to wear a hat when I'm cleaning pools.
00:01:16.159,00:01:18.161,"So, she made me go see Dr."
00:01:18.203,00:01:21.540,He said he had to shave my head to get a closer look at it.
00:01:21.582,00:01:24.585,It was nothing-- they maimed me over a freaking freckle!
00:01:24.626,00:01:28.797,"I feel like that guy that lost all his hair, then lost all his strength."
00:01:33.176,00:01:34.720,"I mean, it's just a Mohawk, right?"
00:01:34.762,00:01:36.055,I'm still Puckasaurus.
00:01:36.095,00:01:42.101,"Actually, I don't know if it's the missing Mohawk or the whining, but I am totally not turned on by you right now."
00:02:00.662,00:02:03.457,You're like a toddler with a loose lid on his sippy cup.
00:02:04.833,00:02:06.167,No more juice.
00:02:06.209,00:02:08.211,"Get ready for payback, Puckerman."
00:02:10.213,00:02:12.007,All right.
00:02:14.676,00:02:16.136,PUCK: I'm human garbage.
00:02:18.263,00:02:21.767,I should just lie here until the truck comes and let it crush me to death.
00:02:21.809,00:02:24.895,What's the point of living when I suck so bad?
00:02:31.860,00:02:35.114,"That black chick from Glee Club used to suck, and now she's all kinds of popular."
00:02:35.155,00:02:38.366,"MERCEDES: If she can straighten herself out, I certainly can."
00:02:38.408,00:02:39.618,But how?
00:02:45.540,00:02:59.387,"Get ready, black girl from Glee Club whose name I can't remember right now, the Puckster is about to make you his."
00:02:59.429,00:03:01.932,"Um... wait, what are these?"
00:03:01.974,00:03:03.058,My vitamin supplements.
00:03:03.100,00:03:04.225,I'm taking them three times a day.
00:03:06.269,00:03:10.273,"I even felt a tickle in the back of my throat, and I never get sick."
00:03:10.315,00:03:15.654,"Well, I just don't understand why you're so tired all of a sudden."
00:03:15.696,00:03:19.741,"As you know, I have perfect pitch, which also means I have a very sensitive ear."
00:03:19.783,00:03:22.077,None of them were singing.
00:03:22.119,00:03:26.247,"I knew I needed proof, so I had a little talk with Lauren Zizes, president of the AV club."
00:03:26.289,00:03:27.499,Bug the choir room?
00:03:34.297,00:03:35.757,Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
00:03:37.592,00:03:41.055,It'll cost you two boxes of Mallomars for me and Snicker bars for my workers.
00:04:21.344,00:04:23.304,Here are the glee club members who are not pulling their weight.
00:04:23.346,00:04:24.556,This is half the club.
00:04:30.520,00:04:32.064,"Oh, man."
00:04:37.945,00:04:39.404,I did some research.
00:04:45.368,00:04:47.162,"Okay, you just said like ten offensive things."
00:04:47.204,00:04:49.123,"My point is, you're popular now."
00:04:49.164,00:04:52.251,And I got to be honest-- I need to spice up my image a little.
00:04:52.292,00:04:53.334,We should join forces.
00:04:53.376,00:04:54.920,It wouldn't take much.
00:04:57.589,00:05:00.592,"You got to admit, I'm easy on the eyes."
00:05:00.634,00:05:03.428,"Baby, I just am not attracted to you."
00:05:03.470,00:05:05.597,"Plus, I know what you do to the girls you date."
00:05:05.639,00:05:08.267,"You knock them up, and then you hang them out to dry."
00:05:08.308,00:05:10.269,Quinn and I weren't dating.
00:05:10.310,00:05:11.937,We just did the nasty.
00:05:11.979,00:05:13.521,And she understood you can't tie me down.
00:05:13.563,00:05:15.149,I'm a sex shark.
00:05:16.441,00:05:19.861,"Okay, I'm going to ask you to stop, because I'm starting to get embarrassed for you."
00:05:19.903,00:05:21.947,You and me would not work out.
00:05:21.989,00:05:23.448,We have nothing in common.
00:05:31.414,00:05:34.209,I am very disappointed in you guys.
00:05:34.251,00:05:35.376,Can't believe you narced on us.
00:05:37.420,00:05:39.965,I'm tired of carrying all of your weight.
00:05:40.007,00:05:42.176,"Regionals is in a month, guys."
00:05:40.007,00:05:43.426,WILL: I'm just trying to understand what's going on here.
00:05:47.430,00:05:49.016,"It kind of shook my confidence, you know?"
00:05:50.934,00:05:52.477,Everyone knows that my job here is to look hot.
00:05:52.519,00:05:54.479,My baby hormones are making me moody.
00:06:00.443,00:06:04.281,A glee club is about a myriad of voices coming together as one.
00:06:04.323,00:06:05.699,All right?
00:06:05.740,00:06:07.408,This ends now.
00:06:07.450,00:06:17.418,Which is why your assignment for the week is for each of you to come up with a song that best represents how you see yourself-- where you are in your lives right now.
00:06:17.460,00:06:18.879,Your voice.
00:06:18.920,00:06:21.422,Then...
00:06:21.464,00:06:23.842,you're going to stand up here and sing your hearts out.
00:06:23.884,00:06:24.885,All of you.
00:06:26.303,00:06:28.263,In front of everyone?
00:06:26.303,00:06:29.514,The Glee Club has lost its voice.
00:06:29.556,00:06:31.975,It's time for us to get it back.
00:06:33.727,00:06:35.270,I am going to kill this assignment.
00:06:35.312,00:06:37.272,"If there's one thing that I know, it's my voice."
00:06:41.193,00:06:42.652,But you know what he didn't have?
00:06:42.694,00:06:45.530,A song by Ms. Whitney Houston in his back pocket.
00:06:45.572,00:06:48.325,"Hey, Kurt!"
00:06:48.367,00:06:50.077,Dad? What are you doing here?
00:06:50.118,00:06:51.494,Is everything okay?
00:06:52.871,00:06:56.875,"I got a pair of tickets to the Reds game, and Carole said that Finn's never been a major league game."
00:06:56.917,00:06:59.669,"I mean, it's Cincinnati, so it's barely the major leagues, but still."
00:06:59.711,00:07:01.380,And why wasn't I invited?
00:07:01.420,00:07:02.630,Are you kidding me?
00:07:02.672,00:07:07.177,"Every time I sit down to watch a game, you start in on the fact that all the players are wearing stirrup pants."
00:07:07.219,00:07:09.346,Because there's never an excuse for stirrup pants!
00:07:09.388,00:07:10.471,"FINN: Okay, I'm ready."
00:07:11.514,00:07:12.682,This is gonna be so great.
00:07:12.724,00:07:14.142,It's gonna be great for Finn.
00:07:14.184,00:07:15.476,"It means a lot to his mom, too."
00:07:15.518,00:07:17.812,"Hey, I'll see you at home."
00:07:22.525,00:07:26.363,"Girl, you got more curves than a Nissan ad."
00:07:26.405,00:07:27.864,Seriously?
00:07:27.906,00:07:29.116,That's what you came up with?
00:07:29.157,00:07:30.367,"WILL: All right, guys."
00:07:34.537,00:07:40.501,"I have chosen Miley Cyrus' The Climb, because it's about overcoming obstacles and beating the odds."
00:07:40.543,00:07:46.967,"In my case, the obstacle is you-- my lackluster teammates who refuse to carry their own weight."
00:08:30.844,00:08:32.220,WILL: Rachel...
00:08:42.272,00:08:47.194,"I noticed you weren't at Cheerios! practice yesterday, and I don't look kindly on absenteeism."
00:08:47.235,00:08:49.154,"I'm so sorry, Ms. Sylvester."
00:08:50.322,00:08:53.074,Something happened yesterday that really upset me.
00:08:54.617,00:08:56.577,He's the most important thing in the world to me.
00:08:56.619,00:08:58.579,I love him.
00:09:04.627,00:09:06.421,Your sexuality.
00:09:08.089,00:09:09.424,Have you even kissed a boy?
00:09:10.467,00:09:11.634,Have you ever kissed a girl?
00:09:13.803,00:09:15.263,"You see, that's the problem with your generation."
00:09:15.305,00:09:17.307,You're obsessed with labels.
00:09:17.349,00:09:18.433,So you like show tunes!
00:09:18.475,00:09:20.101,Doesn't mean you're gay.
00:09:20.143,00:09:21.186,It just means you're awful.
00:09:21.228,00:09:26.816,"You know, there's only one person in this world who can tell you what you are."
00:09:26.858,00:09:27.901,Me.
00:09:32.655,00:09:35.492,Wait-- I have an idea.
00:09:35.534,00:09:39.538,Our assignment for Glee Club is to find a song that reflects our voice...
00:09:39.579,00:09:42.332,I checked out of this conversation about a minute back.
00:09:42.374,00:09:49.589,"So, uh, good luck with your troubles, and I'm gonna make a habit not to stop and talk to students, 'cause this has been a colossal waste of my time."
00:09:57.680,00:09:59.724,"Hey, Kurt..."
00:10:02.310,00:10:03.895,"Hey, Dad, yeah..."
00:10:02.310,00:10:07.607,"I was just, uh, working on my Glee Club assignment, Pink Houses by John Mellencamp."
00:10:10.110,00:10:11.486,"Oh, really?"
00:10:11.528,00:10:13.071,I didn't think that was in your wheelhouse.
00:10:13.113,00:10:18.368,"Yeah, I think it's really brave for a Midwesterner like himself to, uh, write a song about such bold interior design."
00:10:18.410,00:10:21.079,"You know, that's not what the song's about."
00:10:21.121,00:10:22.456,Really?
00:10:22.497,00:10:28.503,"No, it's about how the '80s were a tough time for a lot of people and how the American Dream isn't all it's cracked up to be."
00:10:29.712,00:10:30.880,Fascinating.
00:10:30.922,00:10:35.760,"Hey, why don't we go grab a couple burgers and, uh, you can tell me more about it?"
00:10:35.802,00:10:40.348,"But I gotta be honest, that's pretty much what every Mellencamp song is about."
00:10:43.560,00:10:45.562,Anything to help you out.
00:10:54.946,00:10:58.325,"I'm just this spoiled, annoying only child..."
00:10:58.366,00:10:59.659,Don't say that.
00:10:59.700,00:11:01.702,"There's, like, so many awesome things about you."
00:11:01.744,00:11:03.997,Like?
00:11:10.753,00:11:12.631,I'm kidding.
00:11:14.757,00:11:16.343,"From the looks of things, it's not the first time."
00:11:16.384,00:11:18.637,You should have had them out years ago.
00:11:22.599,00:11:24.601,This is a very serious infection.
00:11:24.643,00:11:27.728,I think she's worried about the surgery affecting her singing voice.
00:11:27.770,00:11:31.024,DOCTOR: At least start by taking these antibiotics.
00:11:40.450,00:11:42.743,What do you think I should do?
00:11:42.785,00:11:44.412,Maybe you should ask your boyfriend.
00:11:44.454,00:11:46.414,"Oh, wait, you can't, He's not here."
00:11:49.584,00:11:52.420,When are you gonna realize that he's not into you like I am?
00:11:52.462,00:11:55.549,You think he's gonna stick around if you can't sing?
00:11:55.590,00:11:57.050,If you're a vocal cripple?
00:11:57.091,00:11:59.760,"Look, I know that you've always been jealous of Jessie."
00:11:59.802,00:12:09.354,"And even though he and I haven't spoken since the Run Joey Run debacle, you just have to accept the fact that I still care about him deeply."
00:12:09.396,00:12:12.982,And I know he still feels the same way about me.
00:14:03.134,00:14:04.511,WILL: Nice work!
00:14:04.552,00:14:08.264,Now that-- that is the kind of soul-exposing song I was talking about.
00:14:08.306,00:14:09.932,We should all be inspired by Finn's bravery.
00:14:09.974,00:14:11.184,"Good job, buddy."
00:14:11.225,00:14:13.353,"Uh, Mr. Shue, can I sing my song now?"
00:14:13.394,00:14:15.522,Yeah.
00:14:21.110,00:14:22.278,What are they doing here?
00:14:22.320,00:14:26.240,I invited my brothers from the jazz band and their righteous horns to help me out with my song.
00:14:27.534,00:14:29.786,"Since I shaved my Mohawk, I started seeing things differently."
00:14:29.828,00:14:34.749,"Last week, I joined a black church, and I recently downloaded every song Sammy Davis Jr."
00:14:34.791,00:14:35.958,ever recorded on iTunes.
00:14:36.000,00:14:38.336,"He was a black Jew, you know."
00:14:38.378,00:14:41.422,"So, without further ado, I give you one of Sammy's biggest hits."
00:16:21.355,00:17:35.388,"BOTH: BOTH: MERCEDES: Look, Quinn, I could never see myself being into a guy like Puck, especially since he's your baby's daddy, but..."
00:17:35.429,00:17:38.558,something just happened between us.
00:17:43.229,00:17:45.523,I screwed up by letting Puck get me pregnant.
00:17:45.565,00:17:48.108,"He's an idiot, and his mother won't let me eat bacon."
00:17:48.150,00:17:58.369,"I'm stuck living with him right now, but at least, if you guys are dating, I won't have to spend so much time listening to his insane theories on how Super Mario Brothers changed civilization."
00:17:58.411,00:18:03.791,But you do realize he's using you and your popularity so he won't get tossed in a Dumpster.
00:18:03.833,00:18:07.962,"I know he's using me, but in a way, it's even better."
00:18:08.004,00:18:09.380,I'm not you.
00:18:09.422,00:18:17.764,"I've never had a guy like me for anything, but now I'm such a steaming mug of hot chocolate that one of the studliest guys in school wants to use me to harvest some mojo."
00:18:17.805,00:18:20.516,I just don't want you getting hurt.
00:18:20.558,00:18:23.394,I know what this is.
00:18:24.687,00:18:26.230,"Oh, I'm not worried about your heart."
00:18:26.272,00:18:31.652,"I might be okay with this, but not even Puck is going to be able to call off Santana."
00:18:36.198,00:18:38.158,"All right, let's get things started."
00:18:38.200,00:18:39.452,"Mr. Shue, I'd like to start us off."
00:18:39.493,00:18:43.414,I believe I've found a song that finally expresses my true voice.
00:18:43.456,00:18:46.042,Okay.
00:18:47.001,00:18:49.087,Gentlemen.
00:20:06.539,00:20:09.249,I don't really think you got the point of the assignment.
00:20:18.092,00:20:20.678,"No, no, this group needs you to be you, Kurt."
00:20:20.720,00:20:23.305,You can literally do things that no one else can.
00:20:23.347,00:20:24.264,I'm not a box.
00:20:24.306,00:20:26.266,There are more than four sides to me.
00:20:26.308,00:20:30.229,Don't lose track of who you are just because it might be a easier to be somebody else.
00:20:36.318,00:20:38.278,that song was hot.
00:20:38.320,00:20:39.279,Oh...
00:20:39.321,00:20:40.573,Merci.
00:20:40.614,00:20:46.913,So you're pretty much the only guy in this school that I haven't made out with because I thought you were capital-G Gay.
00:20:51.500,00:20:54.336,"So, let me know if you want to tap this."
00:21:05.514,00:21:08.142,You have to be able to sleep to sleepwalk.
00:21:08.184,00:21:15.733,"I am on my third day of antibiotics, and I am not getting any better, which means, I'm going to have to have that surgery, which means, my life is over."
00:21:19.361,00:21:21.405,"God, I'm so sick of you feeling sorry for yourself."
00:21:21.447,00:21:22.782,Why don't you get it?
00:21:22.823,00:21:24.283,I am my voice.
00:21:25.534,00:21:26.535,"I am like Tinkerbell, Finn."
00:21:31.290,00:21:33.126,I got a friend I want you to meet.
00:21:33.167,00:21:34.543,Another doctor?
00:21:34.585,00:21:35.920,No.
00:21:35.962,00:21:37.421,No. He's an old friend of mine.
00:21:55.982,00:21:58.525,Your lip gloss tastes like root beer.
00:21:58.567,00:22:02.238,It's weird.
00:22:02.280,00:22:04.991,Can I ask you something?
00:22:05.032,00:22:08.035,What do boys' lips taste like?
00:22:08.077,00:22:11.164,Usually dip.
00:22:11.205,00:22:13.082,Sometimes they taste like burgers.
00:22:13.124,00:22:15.375,Or my armpits.
00:22:15.417,00:22:18.337,Kissing my armpits is a really big turn-on for me.
00:22:27.345,00:22:28.639,Am I interrupting something?
00:22:28.681,00:22:31.433,You sure are.
00:22:46.448,00:22:50.203,"Brittany and I were just, uh, having sexual relations."
00:22:50.244,00:22:53.080,Hi.
00:23:00.462,00:23:07.345,"Kurt, uh... I've been sorta dealing for months with you being gay and everything, and now you're telling me that's not the case?"
00:23:10.472,00:23:14.060,"The flannel, the Mellencamp..."
00:23:17.980,00:23:20.066,"Okay, well..."
00:23:20.107,00:23:22.109,"you're free to be whoever you are, okay?"
00:23:22.151,00:23:26.739,"You just let me know when you make up your mind, I'm gonna do the best I can."
00:23:26.780,00:23:29.867,But I'm good either way.
00:23:31.409,00:23:33.453,Nice to meet you.
00:23:33.495,00:23:35.455,"All right, you kids be careful, all right?"
00:23:35.497,00:23:37.457,"And you gotta respect her, all right?"
00:23:37.499,00:23:40.418,"And if things get serious, use protection."
00:23:44.590,00:23:47.093,Does he mean like a burglar alarm?
00:23:56.518,00:24:04.735,"Look, Puck, I agreed to start dating you because you have great arms, and we have serious musical chemistry-- both of which are really important to me."
00:24:04.777,00:24:06.904,But clearly you've never dated a sister before.
00:24:06.946,00:24:14.995,"And we have needs-- as in you need to stop flapping your gums about this video game nonsense and start finding out more about me, about who I am."
00:24:15.037,00:24:16.496,Okay.
00:24:16.538,00:24:19.417,"I've never done that with a girl before, but I'm cool."
00:24:19.457,00:24:22.502,First thing you need to know is I like those frozen coffee drinks.
00:24:22.544,00:24:24.588,Do you want me to get you one?
00:24:24.630,00:24:26.632,Decaf.
00:24:36.934,00:24:37.810,What was that?
00:24:37.851,00:24:39.812,"Whatever I did, I'm-I'm sorry."
00:24:39.853,00:24:42.815,"Here, take my lunch money as an apology."
00:24:46.193,00:24:49.322,"Well, the Tweetosphere says you're dating Mercedes Jones."
00:24:49.363,00:24:51.615,She's one of the most popular girls in school.
00:24:51.657,00:24:53.533,Your cool-o-meter is off the charts.
00:24:53.575,00:24:56.370,Which means most of us are terrified of you again.
00:25:07.840,00:25:10.592,Give me that lunch money.
00:25:26.775,00:25:29.569,"Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?"
00:25:33.115,00:25:39.455,"Yeah, you do, too, but, um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named-- you know his name."
00:25:39.497,00:25:42.249,"Oh, yeah, definitely, I know his name."
00:25:42.291,00:25:44.584,I just wanted to let you know he's mine.
00:25:44.626,00:25:46.586,"No, no, he's mine."
00:27:19.637,00:27:20.680,Wow.
00:27:20.722,00:27:22.349,WILL: That was intense.
00:27:22.391,00:27:24.684,Don't touch me.
00:27:24.726,00:27:25.478,I gotta give you guys props for the passion.
00:27:25.519,00:27:28.147,"Maybe hold back on the animosity a little bit, all right?"
00:27:28.188,00:27:29.189,"Hey, hey, hey!"
00:27:29.231,00:27:30.690,"Seriously, this ends now!"
00:27:30.732,00:27:32.401,All right.
00:27:32.443,00:27:34.528,Please. All right?
00:27:36.738,00:27:38.616,"Enjoy it while you can, Weezie."
00:27:41.743,00:27:42.702,Calm down.
00:27:58.594,00:28:00.720,"Puck, what the hell is going on here?"
00:28:00.762,00:28:01.930,Just a little payback.
00:28:03.223,00:28:04.642,You hear that?
00:28:04.682,00:28:07.019,That's the sound of order being restored.
00:28:09.647,00:28:10.730,"Babe, this is what we do."
00:28:10.772,00:28:11.815,Look at 'em.
00:28:11.857,00:28:12.732,They need this.
00:28:12.774,00:28:16.362,"Without the fear of a good Dumpster toss, it'd be chaos up in this place."
00:28:16.403,00:28:19.781,"Look, you don't need to like it, but you need to accept it-- this is the way things are."
00:28:19.823,00:28:21.241,"'Cause now, we're part of the system."
00:28:21.283,00:28:23.536,We're at the top of the heap.
00:28:23.577,00:28:24.786,Who's next?
00:28:28.624,00:28:30.750,"Hi, uh, Mrs. Fretthold."
00:28:30.792,00:28:32.127,This is Rachel.
00:28:32.169,00:28:33.212,Pretty.
00:28:33.253,00:28:35.214,"Uh, I'll tell Sean you're here."
00:28:35.255,00:28:37.216,I'm sorry it's such a mess.
00:28:39.677,00:28:41.428,"Oh, no, that's fine."
00:28:41.470,00:28:42.596,Is this him?
00:28:42.638,00:28:44.390,"FINN: Uh, yeah."
00:28:44.431,00:28:46.766,We met at football camp a couple years ago.
00:28:46.808,00:28:47.976,He's ready for you.
00:28:48.018,00:28:51.564,SEAN: Fab-five-Finnster!
00:28:51.605,00:28:52.981,Fretter!
00:28:57.819,00:29:00.698,"Yeah. Sean Fretthold, Rachel Berry, Rachel, Sean."
00:29:00.739,00:29:02.449,"Got a boyfriend, Rachel?"
00:29:02.491,00:29:04.201,Um... sort of.
00:29:04.243,00:29:05.994,Sort of?
00:29:06.036,00:29:08.080,Sounds like I got a shot.
00:29:10.332,00:29:11.791,Sorry.
00:29:11.833,00:29:12.876,They make me see a shrink.
00:29:12.918,00:29:16.004,He says I compensate with humor.
00:29:18.924,00:29:26.765,"Third game of the season, right after I met the Finnster, this Yeti of a fullback breaks through the line."
00:29:28.100,00:29:41.280,"I hear a crack, next thing I know, I'm lying on the ground saying to myself, Get up, get up, but nothing was working, you know?"
00:29:41.321,00:29:42.822,Sean was a C4.
00:29:42.864,00:29:45.242,Paralyzed from the upper chest down.
00:29:45.284,00:29:47.077,I'm so sorry.
00:29:47.119,00:29:49.496,Finn says your voice is messed up.
00:29:51.164,00:29:52.708,Is it going to come back?
00:29:55.461,00:29:56.920,Pissed off about what you lost?
00:30:00.882,00:30:04.803,"Like, real... rage."
00:30:06.888,00:30:08.848,I used to just lie in bed and scream.
00:30:08.890,00:30:10.684,Finn shouldn't have brought me here. I'm so sorry.
00:30:10.726,00:30:11.351,"Wait, wait, wait."
00:30:11.393,00:30:13.353,Just...
00:30:13.395,00:30:16.398,tell her about what happened when they gave you the chair.
00:30:19.901,00:30:28.535,They were all excited because I could drive it myself by blowing in that tube.
00:30:28.577,00:30:31.664,The second they left me alone...
00:30:34.916,00:30:37.877,His mom pulled him out when she heard the splash.
00:30:37.919,00:30:39.045,I don't understand.
00:30:39.087,00:30:42.882,Are... Are you trying to tell me that you're happier now?
00:30:44.343,00:30:47.387,I'm miserable.
00:30:47.429,00:30:49.389,I miss my body.
00:30:51.933,00:30:54.978,I miss my friends.
00:30:55.020,00:30:57.063,I miss girls.
00:30:57.105,00:31:02.902,"But I've realized, over time, that I've got other stuff going on."
00:31:08.867,00:31:10.577,Seriously.
00:31:10.619,00:31:13.622,I flew through Calc I in like two months.
00:31:13.664,00:31:15.415,And I can sing.
00:31:16.792,00:31:18.001,He's actually pretty good.
00:31:18.043,00:31:21.630,"I used to sing in the shower, in the car..."
00:31:21.672,00:31:26.259,I didn't have the balls to try out for my school's club like Finn did.
00:31:28.178,00:31:30.472,That pissed me off more than anything.
00:31:31.973,00:31:34.601,What the hell was I afraid of?
00:31:34.643,00:31:38.522,"Sorry, guys, time for physical therapy."
00:31:41.441,00:31:43.318,I'll be here.
00:31:43.360,00:31:44.944,Thanks.
00:31:44.986,00:31:45.987,For what?
00:31:48.031,00:31:52.160,"Just, um... thanks."
00:32:03.004,00:32:04.339,Where's your Cheerios! uniform?
00:32:04.381,00:32:05.424,I quit.
00:32:05.465,00:32:07.217,Nobody quits the Cheerios!
00:32:07.259,00:32:08.677,"You either die, or I kick you off."
00:32:08.719,00:32:11.430,"It was fun, I guess, but..."
00:32:21.732,00:32:23.191,Huh? Nationals is in three weeks!
00:32:23.233,00:32:27.362,I guess I'll just have to take to the mic and deliver a diatribe.
00:32:27.404,00:32:29.364,Probably something about immigrants.
00:32:29.406,00:32:33.827,"Look, I know Glee Club may be super nerdy or whatever, but it's taught me something very important."
00:32:33.869,00:32:35.829,You have to be true to who you are.
00:32:35.871,00:32:37.706,That's something you may want think about.
00:32:37.748,00:32:42.795,'Cause the guy I saw throwing dweebs in the Dumpster yesterday-- I don't like him very much.
00:32:42.836,00:32:44.671,And you know what?
00:32:54.055,00:32:56.182,My secret? Duck fat.
00:32:56.224,00:32:57.643,"Hey, guys."
00:32:57.684,00:32:59.728,Just holding hands with Brittany.
00:33:01.062,00:33:03.273,Now I know what it's like to date a baby.
00:33:03.315,00:33:05.108,"Hey, Kurt."
00:33:05.150,00:33:07.820,Dad. Hey.
00:33:07.861,00:33:16.119,"Finn caught a foul ball in the ninth, so that means free hoagies at Lenny's Hoagies, and then half-price to the motocross tonight, so I promised I'd take him. Hi."
00:33:16.161,00:33:18.288,"Can you excuse us for a minute, boo?"
00:33:18.330,00:33:19.998,What?
00:33:21.708,00:33:25.629,Did you ever think that that might be something I wanted to do with you?
00:33:25.671,00:33:28.507,"Look, Kurt, Finn needs a buddy right now, okay?"
00:35:47.228,00:35:49.439,"That was some serious singing, kid."
00:35:50.482,00:35:52.609,That was Rose's Turn.
00:35:52.651,00:35:55.236,"I could get into that, maybe."
00:35:57.238,00:35:58.991,"Ah, blew it off."
00:35:59.032,00:36:00.617,"You know, too much cholesterol."
00:36:04.746,00:36:08.207,once I told him how bent out of shape I thought you were.
00:36:08.249,00:36:10.794,Me? I'm fine.
00:36:10.836,00:36:14.172,"Kurt, I'm dumb, but I'm not stupid."
00:36:15.256,00:36:20.178,"And I have no idea what that song was about, but finedon't sing like you just sung."
00:36:25.517,00:36:28.895,...maybe I got carried away doing stuff with Finn.
00:36:32.315,00:36:33.817,Thing with me.
00:36:33.859,00:36:34.860,You mean being gay?
00:36:36.528,00:36:37.988,Being gay.
00:36:38.989,00:36:50.249,"Look, I will fight to the death for your right to love whoever you want, but when you were a little baby in my arms, did I dream about taking you to baseball games and talking about girls?"
00:36:50.291,00:36:51.960,"Yeah, I did."
00:36:52.002,00:36:53.294,A lot of fathers do.
00:36:57.298,00:36:58.842,I'm-I'm talking straight to you.
00:36:58.884,00:37:01.053,Don't go playing the victim.
00:37:01.094,00:37:02.929,You know that's not what I mean.
00:37:02.971,00:37:04.723,I know.
00:37:04.764,00:37:06.850,I'm sorry.
00:37:06.892,00:37:10.770,I know you're working hard on yourself to make all this okay.
00:37:20.739,00:37:23.909,It breaks my heart.
00:37:23.950,00:37:27.079,Is that why you were pretending to date that daffy cheerleader?
00:37:27.120,00:37:29.915,"And dressing differently, and singing Mellencamp?"
00:37:29.956,00:37:32.291,I just want you to know that...
00:37:35.336,00:37:38.715,"You don't have to work at anything, Kurt."
00:37:40.800,00:37:42.594,Your job...
00:37:42.635,00:37:49.517,"is to be yourself, and my job is to love you, no matter what."
00:37:49.559,00:37:53.605,Okay? That and a majority ownership in a tire store-- that's all we got.
00:37:53.646,00:37:57.567,"Okay? We stick to that, we're going to be great."
00:38:00.361,00:38:02.280,"Oh, come here."
00:38:08.369,00:38:11.289,"Love you, too."
00:38:23.301,00:38:25.511,Finn with you?
00:38:25.553,00:38:27.180,"No, I came by myself."
00:38:27.222,00:38:28.514,Is that okay?
00:38:28.556,00:38:30.433,Yeah.
00:38:30.475,00:38:44.906,"I, um... I just wanted to say thank you, and for showing me that just because I'm not good at anything other than singing doesn't mean I'm not any good if I can't sing."
00:38:46.407,00:38:50.620,That sounded like a really bad greeting card.
00:38:50.662,00:38:52.789,No. It was cool.
00:38:53.832,00:38:55.959,"Well, anyways, I..."
00:38:56.001,00:38:58.670,I just thought I could maybe return the favor.
00:38:58.711,00:39:01.673,I thought I could give you singing lessons.
00:39:01.714,00:39:04.676,It sort of seemed like an area of interest for you.
00:39:04.717,00:39:10.598,"I'll-I'll come by, like, once a week or something, and we could just see how it goes?"
00:39:10.640,00:39:14.393,"I've-I've helped almost everyone in our glee club, some by brute force, but..."
00:39:14.435,00:39:16.562,"So, your voice came back."
00:39:16.604,00:39:27.490,"Turns out that a heroic dose of antibiotics and a mysterious blend of herbal remedies and a vow of silence is all it takes to cure tonsillitis, so..."
00:39:27.532,00:39:33.663,"I'll probably have to have my tonsils taken out eventually, but, um, I'm-I'm not scared anymore."
00:39:38.459,00:39:41.296,do you want to give it a spin now?
00:39:42.255,00:39:44.382,Sing with you?
00:39:45.466,00:39:47.426,Yeah.
00:39:47.468,00:39:49.012,"Yeah, I'd be honored."
00:39:49.054,00:39:50.847,Come here.
00:39:54.726,00:39:56.728,Take my hand?
00:40:00.565,00:40:02.441,Can you feel that?
00:40:03.735,00:40:05.111,But it's weird.
00:40:05.153,00:40:09.741,"I remember what it feels like, and I can see it, so..."
00:40:09.782,00:40:12.869,it's like I can.
00:40:14.787,00:40:16.081,"I-I, um..."
00:40:17.498,00:40:21.502,I thought we'd do a little classic rock today.
00:40:21.544,00:40:24.172,Finn said you might like that.
00:40:24.214,00:40:25.464,Yeah.
00:40:45.526,00:00:04.129,"BOTH: SEAN: BOTH: ALL: ALL: ALL: RACHEL: ALL: BOTH: SEAN &amp; RACHEL: So here's what you missed last week: Puck had to shave his Mohawk, and people started picking on him."
00:00:08.926,00:00:13.764,"Finn's mom Carol is dating Kurt's dad Burt, which was totally Kurt's idea, but then Kurt got mad that Burt and Finn started hanging out."
00:00:13.806,00:00:18.686,"Rachel hurt her voice and couldn't sing, and she kind of thought that was the only thing that was important."
00:00:22.105,00:00:24.483,I compensate with humor.
00:00:27.027,00:00:29.070,"Hey, you wanted to see me?"
00:00:34.117,00:00:36.328,And he'd like to speak to you.
00:00:42.626,00:00:43.752,We've met.
00:00:48.590,00:00:49.758,He was two years older.
00:00:49.800,00:00:51.802,Dated every girl I liked.
00:01:10.070,00:01:12.698,"What's the matter, Schuester, cat got your talent?"
00:01:16.451,00:01:20.372,We may need to cut some of our district's art programs.
00:01:18.412,00:01:21.707,"It's really just a formality, William."
00:01:21.749,00:01:23.500,"No, it's not. We'll probably cut the glee club."
00:01:23.542,00:01:24.626,What?!
00:01:24.668,00:01:26.378,But-but you were in the glee club.
00:01:26.420,00:01:27.629,Show choir was your life.
00:01:29.423,00:01:32.175,"And after I graduated, I hit the big time."
00:01:36.597,00:01:38.057,We were a smash.
00:01:38.097,00:01:41.560,"Then for three years, I did the cruise ship circuit."
00:01:45.814,00:01:51.570,"Nine years later, I woke up on a urine-stained mattress in the West Lima crack district."
00:01:52.613,00:01:53.781,Then...
00:01:53.822,00:01:56.408,something amazing happened.
00:01:56.450,00:01:58.744,I was introduced to Jesus.
00:02:08.462,00:02:09.630,Don't make that face.
00:02:09.671,00:02:11.882,Global warming's a theory.
00:02:13.216,00:02:17.178,"And four nights a week, I run a show choir conversion group."
00:02:17.220,00:02:18.806,"Hi, I'm Brenda."
00:02:18.847,00:02:22.768,And it's been 42 days since I sang a show tune.
00:02:24.227,00:02:30.859,"Years ago when I auditioned to play Miss Adelaide in Guys and Dolls, I was asked to take my top off."
00:02:34.237,00:02:38.784,And... that's when I started huffing glue.
00:02:38.826,00:02:41.578,My name is Russell; I'm a glee club survivor.
00:02:41.620,00:02:45.916,"Whenever anything bad would happen, I would just say, Let's put on a show."
00:02:47.250,00:02:49.210,Puttin' on a show!
00:02:54.675,00:02:57.052,Show choir kills.
00:02:59.429,00:03:03.142,Make sure you're not building up their hopes just to have them knocked down.
00:03:03.182,00:03:05.144,What if I say no?
00:03:05.184,00:03:08.689,"Just let him speak to the kids, William."
00:03:12.275,00:03:13.610,What's the worst that can happen?
00:03:16.279,00:03:17.489,This is Mr. Ryan.
00:03:17.531,00:03:21.409,"He's a member of the school board, and he would like to say a few words."
00:03:21.451,00:03:29.001,I-I just want you guys to listen critically and know that what he's saying is just one of many opinions.
00:03:30.209,00:03:31.461,Take out a piece of paper.
00:03:31.503,00:03:36.842,"And on that paper, I want you to write down your biggest dream."
00:03:49.312,00:03:51.773,Your dream is never going to happen.
00:03:51.815,00:03:57.779,"91% of you will spend your entire lives living in Allen County, Ohio."
00:03:57.821,00:04:07.748,"So unless you wrote down that your dream was to work for a mid-market health insurance provider or find an entry level job in an elderly care facility, you're going to be very disappointed."
00:04:07.789,00:04:10.500,This is really depressing.
00:04:10.542,00:04:14.379,I'm going to guess that a lot of your dreams involve showbiz.
00:04:16.339,00:04:20.177,Showbiz dreams are the most unrealistic of them all.
00:04:20.219,00:04:23.222,But... that's what I want to do with my life.
00:04:23.263,00:04:29.811,"Oh, look, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, I'm just trying to spare you disappointment."
00:04:29.853,00:04:31.146,I think we get your point.
00:04:31.188,00:04:35.400,"Aw, well, Schuester here's a prime example."
00:04:40.405,00:04:49.039,"But he couldn't make it happen for himself, so he now has to try and convince you all that it will happen for you."
00:04:49.081,00:04:49.998,Guess what?
00:04:58.840,00:05:01.843,"Okay, you're done here."
00:05:04.387,00:05:05.639,You've said your piece.
00:05:05.680,00:05:07.766,Now get out.
00:05:07.808,00:05:12.229,"Well, Schuester, I should thank you."
00:05:26.701,00:05:28.287,Thanks.
00:05:28.328,00:05:30.413,Godard on Godard?
00:05:30.455,00:05:34.375,He was the master of the French New Wave.
00:05:34.417,00:05:43.384,"I was figuring that since I'm never going to become a star as a performer, maybe I could become one behind the camera."
00:05:43.426,00:05:46.471,Did you know Christopher Reeve directed a movie after his accident?
00:05:46.513,00:05:47.555,Didn't see it.
00:05:47.597,00:05:49.432,"Oh, me neither. Too depressing."
00:05:49.474,00:05:52.060,Is that what you wrote as your dream?
00:05:52.102,00:05:55.230,Before Bryan Ryan crumpled it up and tossed it in the trash?
00:05:55.272,00:05:56.439,Yes.
00:05:56.481,00:05:58.233,Why are you lying to me?
00:05:59.609,00:06:03.530,"After everybody left, I went back for my book bag and something stopped me."
00:06:07.450,00:06:08.827,I don't understand you.
00:06:17.127,00:06:18.419,What's the difference?
00:06:18.461,00:06:20.421,I'm never going to actually become a dancer.
00:06:20.463,00:06:22.674,My legs are never going to work again.
00:06:36.479,00:06:37.689,A dance number.
00:06:40.483,00:06:43.237,You were pretty hot in Proud Mary.
00:06:43.278,00:06:45.572,Why don't we try and kick it up a few notches.
00:07:00.503,00:07:01.880,Hi.
00:07:01.922,00:07:04.674,How was your spring break?
00:07:04.716,00:07:08.303,Good.
00:07:08.345,00:07:10.430,It's good to be back.
00:07:21.358,00:07:22.525,"Luckily, I've known mine since I was four."
00:07:22.567,00:07:26.905,"I'm going to play three parts on Broadway-- Evita, Funny Girl and Laurey in Oklahoma."
00:07:29.532,00:07:31.534,It's what I do when I'm feeling a little stressed.
00:07:31.576,00:07:33.078,That's not a dream.
00:07:35.997,00:07:39.709,"The one thing that you know if it came true, all the hurt would go away."
00:07:39.751,00:07:44.298,"You singing, Don't Cry For Me Argentina, in front of a sold-out crowd, isn't a fantasy."
00:07:53.598,00:07:56.517,I thought you'd never come back.
00:07:58.561,00:07:59.980,Never.
00:08:01.648,00:08:04.401,"So what is it, your dream?"
00:08:06.569,00:08:09.614,"Well, then go inside, find it and ask it what it's gonna take."
00:08:16.579,00:08:18.790,"When you lie awake at night, what's missing?"
00:08:21.584,00:08:22.919,Your mom?
00:08:29.592,00:08:35.974,"I don't really need to meet her or anything, but maybe just find out her name or... something about her."
00:08:37.600,00:08:39.560,It's silly.
00:08:41.604,00:08:43.231,Why?
00:08:43.273,00:08:49.279,"Well, just because my dad never told me anything, and I didn't want to ask them anything 'cause I didn't want to hurt their feelings."
00:08:51.448,00:08:53.574,Do you know why I came back to school here?
00:09:27.692,00:09:29.652,My tap wheels suck.
00:09:32.655,00:09:36.617,I sound like someone put tap shoes on a horse and then shot it.
00:09:36.659,00:09:37.869,Will you bring me those?
00:09:43.666,00:09:44.918,The kid with cerebral palsy?
00:09:44.959,00:09:46.627,They're his extra pair.
00:09:46.669,00:09:48.713,Help me get up on them.
00:10:14.322,00:10:17.117,I'm going to try to take a step.
00:10:17.158,00:10:18.785,Okay.
00:10:21.704,00:10:23.957,You're doing it.
00:10:30.713,00:10:32.299,Go away.
00:10:32.340,00:10:34.342,Let me bring your chair over.
00:10:34.384,00:10:36.595,Just go... away.
00:10:38.221,00:10:39.680,You pushed me to do this.
00:10:39.722,00:10:42.683,I'm sorry.
00:10:42.725,00:10:44.352,"Just go away, please."
00:10:55.738,00:10:56.990,"Hello, Will."
00:10:57.031,00:10:58.699,Just taking stock of the home ec supplies.
00:10:58.741,00:11:04.581,"You see, our home ec program teaches practical skills like food service preparation."
00:11:04.623,00:11:05.790,"Can't feed a child sheet music, Will."
00:11:05.832,00:11:08.376,"I mean, I suppose you could for a while, but..."
00:11:09.752,00:11:11.296,I'd like to buy you a beer.
00:11:11.338,00:11:12.213,Oh.
00:11:12.255,00:11:13.507,"No, no."
00:11:13.548,00:11:15.716,I want to convince you that you're wrong.
00:11:15.758,00:11:16.926,You won't.
00:11:30.398,00:11:31.441,I found her.
00:11:31.483,00:11:33.151,Your mother? Where?
00:11:33.193,00:11:34.569,In the library.
00:11:36.488,00:11:40.783,"I've been researching her all morning, and as I suspected, my intuition has been proven correct."
00:11:40.825,00:11:43.702,My mother is Broadway legend Patti LuPone.
00:11:44.787,00:11:48.667,I've always had a deep connection to Ms. LuPone-- her choice of roles and songs.
00:11:55.590,00:11:57.800,1994 was a big year for Mother.
00:11:59.636,00:12:02.763,"But that was in New York; I was born in Ohio, you say."
00:12:12.815,00:12:16.777,Are you saying that your fathers impregnated Patti LuPone in the Marriott in Akron?
00:12:16.819,00:12:18.029,Was Mandy Patinkin in on this?
00:12:18.071,00:12:22.783,All you have to do is look at pictures of her in her performance in Master Class in 1996.
00:12:22.825,00:12:27.830,Look at the pain in her eyes and the hurt she's feeling from giving up her obviously talented little girl.
00:12:27.872,00:12:30.749,One question: What was in it for her?
00:12:36.923,00:12:39.467,I don't know.
00:12:39.509,00:12:41.428,Guess you're right.
00:12:41.469,00:12:44.889,Do you want to hear my research that proves that my mother is Bernadette Peters?
00:12:46.849,00:12:56.859,"I don't know, I guess I just don't want to think that my mother is some teenage trollop like Quinn, or worse, some skanky girl who would do anything for money, including giving me up."
00:12:55.275,00:12:58.612,Why does it have to be one of those choices?
00:12:58.653,00:13:01.448,Maybe she had a really good reason for doing what she did.
00:13:01.489,00:13:03.491,We need to do a real investigation.
00:13:08.329,00:13:12.833,My fathers kept every piece of paper related to my life in files and cabinets in our basement.
00:13:16.379,00:13:17.796,We'll start there.
00:13:20.383,00:13:22.677,WILL: You were a big deal at McKinley.
00:13:32.687,00:13:34.439,Not all of them.
00:13:34.481,00:13:35.690,Really?
00:13:37.816,00:13:39.653,Terri Delmonico.
00:13:39.694,00:13:40.528,You remember her?
00:13:44.699,00:13:45.908,"Yeah, she was, she was cool."
00:13:45.950,00:13:47.034,Oh...
00:13:49.912,00:13:50.913,Yeah.
00:13:52.915,00:13:55.335,Wow. I'm sorry to hear that.
00:13:56.586,00:14:01.090,"I-I really loved her, and, you know, just..."
00:14:04.927,00:14:07.096,finally get out of a terrible marriage?
00:14:12.226,00:14:14.479,Coaching Glee Club.
00:14:14.521,00:14:15.896,"No, you're right."
00:14:15.938,00:14:18.274,I-I'm... I'm never going to be on Broadway.
00:14:18.316,00:14:20.985,And maybe the same is going to go for most of those kids.
00:14:21.027,00:14:22.862,But that's not the point.
00:14:23.946,00:14:30.704,Glee Club-- it's not just about expressing yourself to everyone else.
00:14:30.745,00:14:32.831,It's about expressing yourself to yourself.
00:14:41.255,00:14:43.842,I am miserable.
00:14:43.883,00:14:47.762,"Ever since I stopped performing, I cannot stand my life!"
00:14:48.805,00:14:54.894,"Three times a year, I tell my wife I'm going off to a business trip, I sneak out to New York, I see a bunch of Broadway shows."
00:14:55.854,00:14:59.940,"I have a box of Playbills hidden away in my basement, Will."
00:14:59.982,00:15:02.402,Like porn.
00:15:13.454,00:15:14.414,You remember?
00:15:14.455,00:15:15.582,"Sectionals, 1992."
00:15:18.376,00:15:21.755,"I mean, I... I know this isn't quite as theatrical, but you're gonna sing it again right now."
00:15:21.796,00:15:22.839,I can't.
00:15:22.881,00:15:25.966,"Yes, you can."
00:16:30.531,00:16:33.493,"Whatever happened to you in the past, it's over."
00:16:33.534,00:16:35.912,You've got to give it another shot.
00:16:35.954,00:16:38.957,Lima Theatre Guild is doing a production of Les Miz.
00:16:38.998,00:16:44.295,"Auditions are Friday, and both of us are trying out."
00:16:44.337,00:16:45.630,All right?
00:16:45.672,00:16:46.673,"Oh, oh, okay."
00:16:50.677,00:16:52.846,Hey.
00:16:55.264,00:16:57.851,"No, I'm sorry."
00:17:02.772,00:17:06.484,I think I just kind of freaked out when I actually had to face it.
00:17:06.526,00:17:08.068,Who says it's hopeless?
00:17:12.573,00:17:14.074,Maybe they're the wrong doctors.
00:17:14.116,00:17:17.996,I went online and did some research about the new treatments on spinal cord injuries.
00:17:18.037,00:17:23.710,Did you know that some doctors are implanting electrical stimulators in patients' bodies to recover hand movements?
00:17:23.751,00:17:25.085,My hands work.
00:17:25.127,00:17:27.087,They're just starting to develop the technology.
00:17:30.132,00:17:35.262,And some scientists at UC San Diego were actually able to regenerate a rat's damaged spinal cord.
00:17:35.304,00:17:38.850,There are hundreds of studies going on right now using stem cells.
00:17:40.810,00:17:45.023,I guess I just wanted to tell you not to give up on your dream.
00:17:45.732,00:17:48.776,"If you can imagine it, it can come true."
00:18:00.830,00:18:02.957,What took you so long?
00:18:04.166,00:18:08.004,"There was so much stuff in the basement, it's like a shrine."
00:18:08.046,00:18:10.214,It's creepy and flattering at the same time.
00:18:10.256,00:18:14.052,"But these boxes had the earliest dates on them, so..."
00:18:15.261,00:18:17.013,My baby teeth.
00:18:19.015,00:18:20.975,Look.
00:18:21.017,00:18:21.976,Is that me?
00:18:22.018,00:18:22.936,Looks like you.
00:18:28.190,00:18:29.525,Put that there.
00:18:30.443,00:18:32.779,My first singing competition.
00:18:32.820,00:18:33.947,I came in first place.
00:18:35.197,00:18:36.950,I was very musically verbal.
00:18:36.991,00:18:38.993,Cute little baby shoes.
00:18:47.209,00:18:49.837,What's this?
00:18:49.879,00:18:51.839,From Mother to Daughter.
00:18:53.883,00:18:57.011,"Oh, my God, she wrote this."
00:18:57.053,00:18:58.888,She held this in her hand.
00:18:58.930,00:19:01.057,Wh-What are you doing?
00:19:01.099,00:19:02.558,Playing the tape.
00:19:02.600,00:19:04.226,Why not?
00:19:04.268,00:19:05.478,I-I'm not ready.
00:19:05.519,00:19:07.981,"Look, this is all happening too fast."
00:19:08.022,00:19:09.983,What if she's singing on the tape?
00:19:10.024,00:19:11.484,What if she's terrible?
00:19:11.525,00:19:13.778,"Or worse, what if she's better than me?"
00:19:13.820,00:19:17.615,"I can't believe we're so close to your dream coming true, and you're running away from it."
00:19:17.657,00:19:18.491,"It's, it's my choice."
00:19:18.532,00:19:21.201,"It's... it's my life, and..."
00:19:21.243,00:19:22.912,"No, I'm-I'm not ready."
00:19:22.954,00:19:25.873,"Jessie, I think that you should go."
00:19:47.311,00:19:49.022,"Hey, buddy."
00:19:50.314,00:19:52.859,I'm trying out for the role of Jean Valjean.
00:19:52.900,00:19:53.943,So am I.
00:19:53.985,00:19:55.028,Really?
00:19:57.279,00:19:58.865,BRYAN: What song do you plan on singing?
00:19:58.906,00:20:01.742,I was going to sing The Impossible Dream.
00:20:01.784,00:20:03.243,"Wow, really?"
00:20:03.285,00:20:05.746,So am I.
00:20:05.788,00:20:08.875,"But then, I decided on Aerosmith's Dream On."
00:20:08.916,00:20:11.085,"Yeah, me, too. That's what I'm gonna sing."
00:20:13.295,00:20:15.048,"Yeah, there's a problem; this guy just stole my song!"
00:20:17.299,00:20:18.885,I overheard her mention he's a sex offender.
00:20:18.926,00:20:21.179,"Oh, you're gonna need a caretaker in a second, buddy."
00:20:21.220,00:20:22.138,I run a dry cleaners.
00:20:22.180,00:20:25.058,I can only keep it closed for 30 minutes at a time.
00:20:25.099,00:20:26.350,Sing it as a duet.
00:23:06.260,00:23:07.887,DUNCAN: Thank you.
00:23:18.105,00:23:19.940,I can't believe I just bought tap shoes.
00:23:26.488,00:23:27.865,They're upstairs.
00:23:27.907,00:23:30.243,Do you mind waiting down here while I go get them?
00:23:30.284,00:23:32.161,As long as you're buying.
00:23:33.495,00:23:34.705,Wait.
00:23:36.082,00:23:37.499,I need to tell you something.
00:23:39.210,00:23:44.257,"I went to the doctor yesterday, and he started me on all of the therapies that you researched for me."
00:23:44.298,00:23:45.341,Really?
00:23:48.510,00:23:50.888,They're working.
00:24:05.194,00:24:07.196,"Oh, my God."
00:24:07.238,00:24:09.115,"Artie, you can walk!"
00:24:14.536,00:24:20.584,"And now that I can, all I want to do is... dance."
00:26:51.193,00:26:53.653,"I'm gonna dance one day, you know."
00:26:53.695,00:26:55.281,I know you are.
00:26:55.322,00:26:58.117,I thought you were gonna take a hatchet to that Glee Club.
00:27:09.711,00:27:17.844,"So I've decided to examine all of the extracurricular activities here at this school, and Sue, your Cheerios!"
00:27:17.886,00:27:20.889,"Let me remind you of something, Mr. Ryan."
00:27:20.931,00:27:22.057,The Cheerios! sell tickets.
00:27:22.099,00:27:23.767,Not enough to offset your costs.
00:27:23.809,00:27:27.521,I am very tired of athletics always taking a back seat.
00:27:27.563,00:27:30.857,"When daily P.E. was cut at this school, no one batted an eye."
00:27:34.736,00:27:36.363,"I did a little research, Sue."
00:27:36.405,00:27:41.994,Did you know that studies have shown that reading Shakespeare might help kids learn physics?
00:27:42.035,00:27:46.748,"That singing helps you learn pitch, which makes learning a foreign language easier?"
00:28:00.971,00:28:02.973,"Where is your outrage about that, Mr. Ryan?"
00:28:03.015,00:28:11.773,"Sports teach kids how to work together, teaches problem solving and social skills, it improves attendance, not to mention grades, particularly among those students deemed the most at risk."
00:28:11.815,00:28:13.400,You've done your homework.
00:28:13.442,00:28:14.860,I'm an educator.
00:28:16.445,00:28:20.533,"Now, I realize my methods are unconventional, but my record speaks for itself."
00:28:20.574,00:28:26.788,Is it a tad over the top to bill the district for skydiving lessons to have the Cheerios! parachuted onto the football field?
00:28:26.830,00:28:28.040,Perhaps.
00:28:28.081,00:28:29.916,But what I do here makes a difference.
00:28:29.958,00:28:31.918,"Sue, you're an impressive woman."
00:28:36.965,00:28:38.592,"It's the only kind I know, Bryan."
00:28:38.634,00:28:40.760,I should tell you I'm married.
00:28:40.802,00:28:42.012,And I'm still cutting half your budget.
00:28:42.054,00:28:43.639,"You win some, you lose some."
00:28:44.806,00:28:47.726,No. Got a secret room upstairs.
00:28:48.686,00:28:49.769,Like Letterman.
00:28:56.443,00:28:57.611,She has the tape.
00:29:00.822,00:29:02.074,What?
00:29:02.115,00:29:04.284,She has to listen to it.
00:29:04.326,00:29:05.869,That's the point of all this.
00:29:05.911,00:29:06.995,I'm doing my best!
00:29:09.748,00:29:11.500,"Befriend her was the word I used, actually."
00:29:11.542,00:29:18.674,"Whatever. The thing is, I was into it because I thought it would be a good acting exercise, but now I think I kind of like her."
00:29:18.716,00:29:20.008,I don't want her to get hurt.
00:29:20.050,00:29:23.845,"Look, one more week, this will all be done; you can come back to Vocal Adrenaline where you belong."
00:29:23.887,00:29:28.808,"I don't understand why you don't just go up to her and say, Hi, my name's Shelby."
00:29:28.850,00:29:30.185,I signed a contract.
00:29:30.227,00:29:33.021,I can't contact her until she's 18.
00:29:33.063,00:29:34.398,She has to come to me.
00:29:34.440,00:29:36.692,That's why she has to listen to the tape.
00:29:45.701,00:29:47.827,I answered an ad in the paper.
00:29:51.873,00:29:54.293,"Her dads seemed like nice guys, so I went for it."
00:29:56.044,00:29:58.922,I never got to hold her.
00:30:00.716,00:30:05.679,And I only saw her for a second when they were cleaning her off.
00:30:05.721,00:30:12.352,"It was through a bunch of nurses, but she turned her little head, and she looked at me."
00:30:18.776,00:30:20.860,I've failed as an actress.
00:30:20.902,00:30:28.786,"My walls are lined with trophies instead of wedding pictures, but through all of of that..."
00:30:28.827,00:30:30.996,I only have one regret.
00:30:32.998,00:30:35.083,You get her to listen to that tape.
00:30:44.301,00:30:54.353,"You know, honestly, the only students that come and see me on a scheduled weekly basis are ones that have been diagnosed with psychological disorders, like a certain junior female that eats her own hair."
00:30:54.394,00:30:59.399,"When I start walking, I'm gonna need help emotionally adapting to my drastically altered lifestyle."
00:30:59.441,00:31:01.901,Walking?
00:31:01.943,00:31:04.988,There are all these new therapies for my condition.
00:31:05.030,00:31:07.866,"I figure if I try them all, one's bound to work."
00:31:09.993,00:31:12.912,Um...
00:31:12.954,00:31:14.998,"you know, Artie, I have, um..."
00:31:17.334,00:31:22.881,Um... the damage to your spinal cord's pretty severe.
00:31:24.424,00:31:25.843,Irreversible.
00:31:26.593,00:31:27.803,I think you know that.
00:31:27.845,00:31:30.930,I used to know that until I saw the research.
00:31:34.976,00:31:39.857,Do you know how long the testing process takes for medical protocols like this?
00:31:39.939,00:31:45.362,"At least ten years, and-and that's before they even start human trials."
00:31:45.404,00:31:48.365,"So, you know, these..."
00:31:45.404,00:31:50.409,these studies really aren't even in their infancies yet.
00:31:59.793,00:32:06.299,"you know, I don't think that's gonna be for... a long time."
00:32:09.469,00:32:13.223,You know what? Um...
00:32:13.265,00:32:17.102,Maybe you should start coming to see me once a week for a while.
00:32:23.024,00:32:24.150,"Thanks, Ms. Pillsbury."
00:32:24.192,00:32:26.945,"Don't forget your, um, papers."
00:32:37.038,00:32:40.166,and I took a little shopping spree through the Jazzhands catalogue.
00:32:40.208,00:32:41.293,You know why?
00:32:41.334,00:32:42.961,'Cause the arts matter.
00:32:44.045,00:32:53.263,And I got custom-made New Directions! jean jackets and some rad tearaway dancewear.
00:32:55.056,00:32:59.895,And every piece of sheet music from every Broadway show for the last 50 years.
00:32:59.937,00:33:03.022,Everything a show choir needs to become champions.
00:33:04.107,00:33:05.901,Let's all give a hand for Mr. Ryan.
00:33:09.112,00:33:10.739,"SUE: Congratulations, Will."
00:33:10.781,00:33:13.074,I'm over the moon for you.
00:33:16.453,00:33:18.079,"No, no, I'm not talking about that."
00:33:21.082,00:33:24.962,"Local director, Herb Duncan, does the dry cleaning for the Cheerios!"
00:33:25.003,00:33:29.758,and he let it slip that you just landed the lead in Les Miz!
00:33:29.800,00:33:31.551,Congratulations.
00:33:31.593,00:33:33.303,"SUE: Oh, I'm ecstatic."
00:33:33.345,00:33:37.056,"And the good news just keeps coming, 'cause you got a part, too, Bry."
00:33:37.098,00:33:39.643,The exciting role of Townsperson.
00:33:41.102,00:33:44.189,"Way back here in the second act, you get to say..."
00:33:45.273,00:33:47.066,Hooray.
00:33:47.108,00:33:49.068,"Congratulations, both of you, really."
00:33:49.110,00:33:50.111,I can't wait for opening night.
00:33:57.828,00:33:59.955,"WILL: Wait, Bryan."
00:33:59.997,00:34:01.080,"Congratulations, Will."
00:34:01.122,00:34:02.541,You're going to be great in the show.
00:34:02.582,00:34:04.083,Can we talk about this?
00:34:04.125,00:34:06.127,I'm cutting the program.
00:34:20.141,00:34:21.476,Make it quick.
00:34:21.518,00:34:23.186,"You know, reviewing my single line."
00:34:23.228,00:34:26.481,I want to take one last shot at convincing you not to cut the program.
00:34:28.149,00:34:32.779,"You think you're helping these kids, when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter."
00:34:32.821,00:34:34.113,You're right.
00:34:40.662,00:34:44.541,"They sting, and they make me want to punch your face."
00:34:48.169,00:34:51.006,You remember high school?
00:34:54.175,00:34:57.220,Those kids get labeled the second they walk through the door freshman year.
00:34:57.262,00:35:01.892,"Geek, punk, jock, queer."
00:35:03.184,00:35:05.854,I've seen who these kids in Glee Club really are.
00:35:05.896,00:35:09.900,"No labels, no preconceptions, their true spirits."
00:35:11.192,00:35:16.155,"Yes, most of them are not stars..."
00:35:19.117,00:35:21.411,"Do you know what happens when a star dies, Bryan?"
00:35:21.453,00:35:23.038,It doesn't just disappear.
00:35:23.080,00:35:31.046,"It turns into this black hole, this giant energy-sucking mass that doesn't just collapse in on itself; it takes away any light that comes close down with it."
00:35:31.088,00:35:40.889,"You take away Glee, you're not just putting out those kids' lights; you're creating 13 black holes."
00:35:46.686,00:35:49.106,I want you to take my part.
00:35:50.273,00:35:53.526,You should play Jean Valjean.
00:36:03.244,00:36:05.288,You're a black hole right now.
00:36:05.330,00:36:09.501,Maybe this will help you remember what it's like to be a star.
00:36:10.460,00:36:16.925,"So, what you're saying is, you'll give me the part if I don't cut the program."
00:36:16.967,00:36:19.011,Exactly.
00:36:19.052,00:36:20.929,Cool. Deal.
00:36:20.971,00:36:22.221,"Oh, hey, sir. Hi."
00:36:26.267,00:36:30.188,"And, uh, next, I don't really take direction."
00:36:34.109,00:36:35.443,"Jessie, what are you doing here?"
00:36:35.485,00:36:38.030,I said that I was going to help you make your dreams come true.
00:36:38.071,00:36:39.238,No. I'm not ready.
00:36:39.280,00:36:40.991,"Yes, you are."
00:36:54.295,00:36:55.672,It's your mom.
00:36:57.007,00:36:59.718,I think this pretty much says it all.
00:39:51.056,00:39:52.265,I have.
00:39:53.350,00:39:56.269,You've worked too hard on this routine to have half a partner.
00:39:56.311,00:40:03.151,"Fact is, any of the guys in there could dance my part better than me without even rehearsing Well, except Finn."
00:40:03.193,00:40:04.610,But I want to dance with you.
00:40:04.652,00:40:08.198,"I can't dance, and I never will."
00:40:09.282,00:40:11.243,But... that's okay.
00:40:11.284,00:40:14.412,"I'm never going to dunk a basketball or kill a lion, either."
00:40:15.872,00:40:20.252,I have to focus on dreams that I can make come true.
00:40:20.293,00:40:21.460,"I'm good, Tina."
00:40:21.502,00:40:23.171,Really.
00:40:29.510,00:40:32.138,Will you at least sing the song?
00:40:32.180,00:40:34.140,Sure.
00:40:39.771,00:40:42.065,"All right, guys, listen up."
00:40:42.107,00:40:47.404,"Tina has something that she wants to share with all of us, but first, I have an announcement to make."
00:40:47.445,00:40:49.155,You've all been reprieved.
00:40:52.825,00:40:54.160,Yeah.
00:40:54.202,00:40:55.787,Did he die?
00:40:55.828,00:40:57.289,No. He didn't die.
00:40:57.330,00:41:02.501,"He, uh, is going to be distracted for a couple months making his star turn in Les Miz."
00:41:03.920,00:41:05.588,But I thought you got the lead.
00:41:05.630,00:41:07.132,I resigned.
00:41:07.173,00:41:08.925,It was the price for keeping the club.
00:41:08.967,00:41:11.136,"Sorry you had to do that, Mr. Shue."
00:41:11.177,00:41:12.511,I'm not.
00:41:12.553,00:41:20.353,"You know, th-the way I see it, I'm trading my one dream for the chance that all 13 of you might find yours."
00:41:23.940,00:41:25.108,"So, let's start with Tina's dream."
00:41:25.150,00:41:27.568,"Come on up, Tina."
00:41:27.610,00:41:33.199,"Tina, I understand that you whipped up a little dance number for us-- a breakout that we might use at Regionals."
00:41:33.241,00:41:34.533,Yes.
00:41:34.575,00:41:36.494,You got a dance partner?
00:41:37.662,00:41:39.705,Mike Chang.
00:41:39.747,00:41:41.207,Chang.
00:41:42.583,00:41:43.918,"All right, Chang!"
00:00:10.093,00:00:13.681,You think you're helping these kids when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter.
00:00:13.722,00:00:18.727,"Finn's mom's dating Kurt's dad, which was totally part of Kurt's plan to get closer to Finn, who he's always sort of had a crush on."
00:00:21.146,00:00:25.359,"Artie told Tina what his greatest dream was, then realized that not every dream is achievable."
00:00:25.400,00:00:26.234,Is that even a word-- achievable?
00:00:26.276,00:00:27.653,Achievatate?
00:00:28.904,00:00:30.447,"Okay, you just said, like, ten offensive things."
00:00:30.489,00:00:35.076,"Jessie pushed Rachel to find out who her mom was, and it turns out it's Shelby Corcoran, the coach of Vocal Adrenaline."
00:00:46.129,00:00:47.673,Am I in trouble?
00:00:47.715,00:00:50.467,Come on. You've got more self-esteem than that.
00:00:50.509,00:00:53.136,I think this might have something to do with your perfect attendance last semester.
00:00:53.178,00:00:55.890,No. Miss Cohen-Chang is in trouble.
00:00:55.931,00:01:00.477,It has come to my attention that the look you sport is what is known as goth.
00:01:31.174,00:01:33.218,They don't exist.
00:01:33.260,00:01:35.721,"William, denial will not make this problem go away!"
00:01:35.763,00:01:37.723,My parents won't even let me watch Twilight.
00:01:37.765,00:01:40.017,My mom says she thinks Kristin Stewart seems like a bitch.
00:01:40.059,00:01:41.852,This is a serious problem!
00:01:41.894,00:01:44.939,"Miss Cohen-Chang, you've got to find yourself another style of dress!"
00:01:46.481,00:01:50.402,"Tina is shy, and one way she's found to express herself is through her clothes."
00:01:50.444,00:01:55.032,High school is an incredibly important time when kids get to explore who they are.
00:01:55.074,00:01:59.327,"When I was in high school, I had a whole year where I dressed exactly like Kurt Cobain."
00:01:59.369,00:02:01.329,There has to be someone who you used to dress like.
00:02:01.371,00:02:05.166,"Yes. For several years in my early 20s, I dressed up as Elvis."
00:02:05.208,00:02:06.752,"But he was a Christian, Will!"
00:02:06.794,00:02:11.632,And he did not possess the ability to transform into a bat!
00:02:11.673,00:02:13.341,I think he thinks vampires are real.
00:02:13.383,00:02:14.342,I think you're right.
00:02:14.384,00:02:23.351,Studies have shown that a strict dress code fosters a safe and stable learning environment with fewer instances of gang violence and vampirism.
00:02:34.237,00:02:35.363,CAROLE: Step.
00:02:35.405,00:02:37.908,Couple more.
00:02:37.950,00:02:39.701,Is there a car down here from me?
00:02:42.663,00:02:44.205,And open your eyes.
00:02:47.501,00:02:49.586,Sparkling cider?
00:02:49.628,00:02:51.212,Yeah.
00:02:53.256,00:02:55.092,But who went somewhere?
00:02:55.134,00:02:57.011,Burt asked us to move in with them.
00:02:57.052,00:02:58.971,And this is how you're telling me?
00:03:00.055,00:03:01.640,The party is my idea.
00:03:01.682,00:03:03.600,"If you're gonna say something, say it loud, right?"
00:03:03.642,00:03:07.521,"BURT: getting used to, but trust me, you're gonna love it, okay?"
00:03:07.562,00:03:11.608,Now you don't have to drag your tail over here every time you want to watch something on the old 55-incher.
00:03:11.650,00:03:15.236,We got a lot of food-- some ethnic food. It's some ethnicity that's not ours.
00:03:15.278,00:03:16.404,Tuna cruditÃ©s.
00:03:20.534,00:03:21.743,Two and a half.
00:03:21.785,00:03:24.163,I don't want an extra bathroom or a tuna crude.
00:03:36.091,00:03:37.176,We need to redecorate.
00:03:38.385,00:03:39.970,I'm not cool with that!
00:03:41.221,00:03:43.891,But can't be much of a surprise.
00:03:43.932,00:03:46.267,"And, in time, you're gonna be as happy as I am."
00:03:46.309,00:03:49.063,"Yeah, look, I'll knock out a wall upstairs, I'll put an addition on, okay?"
00:03:54.026,00:03:55.069,Have at it.
00:03:55.110,00:03:55.986,You redecorate this place.
00:03:56.028,00:03:57.404,"Don't worry, roomie."
00:03:57.445,00:03:59.781,Mr. Ikea Catalog and I will have this all figured out.
00:03:59.823,00:04:04.953,I am going to put together a palate that expresses who you are and who I want you to be.
00:04:06.329,00:04:07.664,"Hey, what night's game night?"
00:04:07.706,00:04:09.290,You play Sorry?
00:04:09.332,00:04:10.876,You know...
00:04:10.918,00:04:11.877,I will...
00:04:11.919,00:04:13.087,I will beat you.
00:04:14.129,00:04:15.463,This so isn't you.
00:04:15.505,00:04:17.298,I feel like an Asian Branch Davidian.
00:04:17.340,00:04:19.134,"Tina, are there any other looks you can try?"
00:04:23.847,00:04:25.015,Catholic schoolgirl.
00:04:25.057,00:04:26.307,"Happy Meal, no onions."
00:04:26.349,00:04:27.226,Or a chicken.
00:04:27.267,00:04:31.105,"Look, I appreciate it, guys, but it just isn't me."
00:04:31.146,00:04:33.899,"I know who I am, and I'm not allowed to show it."
00:04:38.361,00:04:40.822,Isn't that against the rules?
00:04:42.407,00:04:48.247,"Anyway, what I figured out; I rooted through the Dumpsters behind the Carmel auditorium and I found 18 empty boxes of Christmas lights."
00:04:48.288,00:04:49.164,"Oh, no."
00:04:49.206,00:04:50.707,Which led me to Joelle Fabrics.
00:04:50.749,00:04:52.626,I asked them about red Chantilly lace.
00:04:52.667,00:04:53.794,They were sold out.
00:04:54.962,00:04:56.588,"Oh, my."
00:05:00.467,00:05:01.718,They're going for full-out theatricality.
00:05:01.760,00:05:04.221,They know it's the easiest way to beat us. Damn them.
00:05:05.388,00:05:07.390,"He just, like, dresses weird, right? Like Bowie?"
00:05:07.432,00:05:09.184,Lady Gaga is a woman.
00:05:09.226,00:05:11.770,She's only the biggest pop act to come along in decades.
00:05:10.435,00:05:13.730,"She's boundary-pushing, the most theatrical performer of our generation."
00:05:16.316,00:05:17.234,That's true.
00:05:17.276,00:05:19.527,ARTIE: It makes sense that Vocal Adrenaline would pay homage.
00:05:19.569,00:05:21.155,It's a brilliant move.
00:05:19.569,00:05:22.823,She's a perfect fit for them.
00:05:22.864,00:05:25.075,We might be able to kill two birds with one stone here.
00:05:25.117,00:05:28.912,We can help Tina find a new look and find a competitive number for regionals.
00:05:29.788,00:05:33.250,"This week, your assignment: Gaga."
00:05:33.292,00:05:34.584,"RACHEL: Pens, we need pens."
00:05:34.626,00:05:36.419,My ideas just come to me.
00:05:36.461,00:05:38.337,Right there.
00:05:39.214,00:05:40.381,"And claw, claw, uh, clap, clap."
00:05:40.423,00:05:42.801,"And five, six, seven, eight."
00:05:42.843,00:05:44.385,"One, two, three, four..."
00:05:45.428,00:05:48.015,"If they catch us, are we gonna have to go to jail?"
00:05:52.644,00:05:54.771,"...and five, six, seven, eight."
00:05:58.441,00:06:00.110,"Claw, claw, uh, clap, clap."
00:06:00.152,00:06:01.402,"And five, six-- uh, uh..."
00:06:01.444,00:06:03.197,"Okay, okay, okay, just..."
00:06:03.238,00:06:04.323,enough.
00:06:07.450,00:06:10.329,Theatricality isn't about crazy outfits.
00:06:10.369,00:06:11.997,It's not enough to douse yourselves with gasoline.
00:06:12.039,00:06:14.875,You have to light yourselves on fire to make it work.
00:06:14.916,00:06:15.876,"God, she's good."
00:06:15.917,00:06:21.089,But being theatrical doesn't mean you have to be a nuclear explosion.
00:06:21.131,00:06:24.009,"It can be like, like a quiet storm."
00:06:24.051,00:06:29.430,"You just have to radiate emotion, express what's deep inside you."
00:06:29.472,00:06:33.518,That's what theatricality is truly about.
00:06:35.854,00:06:37.480,Do I have to demonstrate?
00:06:39.482,00:06:42.027,Exactly what I would have done: Barbra.
00:06:42.069,00:06:44.487,I could do it in my sleep.
00:07:51.554,00:07:53.098,Where are you going?
00:09:05.420,00:09:06.546,Ms. Corcoran?
00:09:17.015,00:09:18.558,I'm your daughter.
00:09:26.149,00:09:27.650,Did you ever regret it?
00:09:27.692,00:09:30.611,Yes.
00:09:30.653,00:09:32.655,Then no.
00:09:40.372,00:09:42.290,I saw you sing at sectionals.
00:09:42.332,00:09:44.000,You were extraordinary.
00:09:44.042,00:09:45.085,You were me.
00:09:46.878,00:09:50.006,Was it hard for you to not become a star?
00:09:50.048,00:09:53.593,To not have your dreams come true?
00:09:54.969,00:09:57.680,It felt like a broken promise.
00:09:57.722,00:10:02.143,Like the Fisher King's wound-- never heals.
00:10:04.271,00:10:05.688,Genetics really are amazing.
00:10:05.730,00:10:09.025,You see the world with the same fierce theatricality as I do.
00:10:09.067,00:10:13.696,"Even the way we're sitting right now is so dramatic, and yet we feel so comfortable with it."
00:10:13.738,00:10:16.408,I've missed so much.
00:10:21.955,00:10:24.583,How do you feel?
00:10:24.624,00:10:26.000,Thirsty.
00:10:27.710,00:10:33.633,"When I was little and I used to get sad, my dads would bring me a glass of water."
00:10:47.772,00:10:50.484,Uh...
00:10:50.525,00:10:51.901,I shouldn't have done this.
00:10:56.114,00:10:58.116,This was supposed to feel good.
00:10:58.158,00:11:03.788,W-We were supposed to have some kind of slow-motion run into each other's arms.
00:11:03.830,00:11:04.998,This is all wrong.
00:11:13.340,00:11:16.675,"I'm so sorry, Rachel."
00:11:18.345,00:11:21.931,Uh... I'll... I'll call you.
00:11:35.195,00:11:36.737,"Oh, hey, Finn, come on in."
00:11:38.781,00:11:46.331,"She's got this thing called the Haus of Gaga, which is like, this collective of artists and designers who collaborate on, on her styles and stage sets and her music."
00:11:46.373,00:11:50.126,I think it's an exciting model for what we could be doing in Glee Club.
00:11:50.168,00:11:52.546,"Yeah, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about."
00:11:52.587,00:11:54.548,I don't want to do Lady Gaga.
00:12:04.265,00:12:06.351,Yeah.
00:12:06.393,00:12:07.726,"Yeah, you're right."
00:12:08.811,00:12:11.606,Maybe I haven't been listening to you guys hard enough.
00:12:15.818,00:12:19.780,"Well, I, uh, I actually already have one."
00:12:19.822,00:12:21.199,You're wrong.
00:12:22.825,00:12:25.370,You want to name our daughter Jack Daniels?
00:12:26.413,00:12:28.164,"Okay, fine, whatever."
00:12:28.206,00:12:30.875,The name is not the point.
00:12:30.917,00:12:33.794,I'm giving up the baby so I don't have to do this with you.
00:12:41.344,00:12:43.430,I love wearing champagne bubbles!
00:12:43.471,00:12:45.682,I get to express a whole different side of myself!
00:12:45.724,00:12:49.436,"Because even though I'm painfully shy and obsessed with death, I'm a really effervescent person."
00:12:50.437,00:12:52.897,Excuse me!
00:12:54.482,00:12:55.774,I think you heard me.
00:13:00.655,00:13:03.908,"Well, you know, lately, we haven't been able to tell the difference."
00:13:03.950,00:13:05.076,We're not gaga for Gaga.
00:13:05.118,00:13:08.413,"You dress all freaky, and then you rub it in everybody's faces."
00:13:10.873,00:13:12.208,It's weird.
00:13:12.250,00:13:13.293,It makes my eyes tired.
00:13:16.795,00:13:17.838,It's called being theatrical.
00:13:17.880,00:13:18.881,We're showing off who you are.
00:13:23.303,00:13:25.846,"You're expressing yourself, and we have every right to do the same."
00:13:32.895,00:13:33.854,Okay?
00:13:33.896,00:13:36.650,Knock that crazy fool crepe-paper nonsense offa you.
00:13:36.691,00:13:39.026,Let's go.
00:13:36.691,00:13:41.237,"Yeah, you don't want to be late for your appointment at Supercuts!"
00:13:41.279,00:13:42.863,"Watch your mouth, homo!"
00:13:42.905,00:13:47.118,You don't need an appointment at Supercuts.
00:13:47.160,00:13:48.869,They love walk-ins.
00:13:53.500,00:13:55.251,"Little monsters, take a bow."
00:13:56.919,00:13:59.880,"All right! Ladies, Kurt, I am really, really impressed."
00:13:59.922,00:14:02.883,Sientete.
00:14:06.929,00:14:07.972,Wait. Where's Rachel?
00:14:08.014,00:14:11.892,"I mean, I only noticed because, like, five minutes have gone by without her saying something totally obnoxious."
00:14:11.934,00:14:15.355,Rachel kinda got some intense news yesterday.
00:14:15.396,00:14:17.482,"We were spying on Vocal Adrenaline, and..."
00:14:23.946,00:14:26.073,"Okay, y'all ready?"
00:14:26.115,00:14:27.992,"Miss Corcoran, their coach?"
00:14:28.034,00:14:29.910,She's Rachel's mom.
00:14:30.953,00:14:33.498,"Way to bury the lead, Mercedes."
00:14:34.957,00:14:37.293,Rachel's gonna jump ship over to Vocal Adrenaline.
00:14:37.335,00:14:39.504,"I really don't want to talk about it, though."
00:14:44.634,00:14:51.766,"All I can know is that I'm not going anywhere, and I've chosen a Lady Gaga look that expresses the longing for a childhood I was deprived of."
00:14:53.976,00:14:56.103,I think it's the Kermit-the-Frog look.
00:14:58.981,00:15:03.194,"Well, my dads can't sew, so these are just stapled on."
00:15:03.236,00:15:06.531,"Guys, why don't we worry about this later, and maybe try to focus on the song?"
00:15:06.573,00:15:07.948,Couldn't agree more.
00:17:35.137,00:17:37.056,WILL: All right!
00:17:41.143,00:17:42.144,"Oh, God!"
00:17:43.730,00:17:44.981,What's that on your face?
00:17:48.526,00:17:50.486,"Dude, are you wearing makeup?"
00:17:50.528,00:17:51.487,I knew it was contagious.
00:17:51.529,00:17:54.699,"You moved in with that little Kurt kid, and now you got a bad case of the gay."
00:17:54.741,00:17:55.992,"It's just something for Glee Club, all right?"
00:17:56.034,00:17:57.284,"Oh, well, then it's definitely not gay, huh?"
00:17:57.326,00:17:58.703,Get out of my way!
00:17:58.745,00:18:01.205,"Man, how many times do we got go through this?!"
00:18:07.169,00:18:12.132,"And if we have to kick your ass to make you understand that, then our schedules are wide open."
00:18:14.969,00:18:16.721,"You girls, y'all belong across the hallway."
00:18:30.985,00:18:32.653,"Yeah, that's better, guys."
00:18:32.695,00:18:37.533,"And, ladies, I don't want to hear about chafing just because you're being forced to wear metal underwear."
00:18:37.575,00:18:39.285,Not my problem.
00:18:49.045,00:18:51.965,"Hon, you gotta stop sneaking into these rehearsals."
00:18:52.006,00:18:54.842,It's kind of important.
00:19:03.225,00:19:04.644,My dads can't sew.
00:19:05.812,00:19:08.188,I really need a mom right now.
00:19:09.607,00:19:12.026,Do you think you can help?
00:19:17.239,00:19:18.198,"Whoa, looking good, Rachel!"
00:19:20.493,00:19:22.829,My mom made it.
00:19:26.124,00:19:30.586,"Well, we're all here, so without further ado, I'd like to introduce The Boys!"
00:19:30.628,00:19:34.465,"ARTIE: Lima, Ohio, get ready to rock!"
00:19:56.988,00:19:59.115,Whoo!
00:21:38.380,00:21:41.175,"All right, guys, very impressive."
00:21:41.217,00:21:43.636,"Very, very... loud."
00:21:43.677,00:21:45.972,"But what, uh, what does that performance express?"
00:21:46.013,00:21:47.598,And what do those costumes illustrate?
00:21:47.640,00:21:49.558,"We did our research, Mr. Shue."
00:21:49.600,00:21:56.607,"Yeah, Finn's demon look is because Gene Simmons liked comic books as a kid, and they called Paul Stanley the Star Child because he was a romantic or something."
00:21:56.649,00:21:58.358,But that doesn't really explain my whore lips.
00:21:58.400,00:22:01.528,And my Ace Frehley is supposed to be a spaceman from another planet.
00:22:01.570,00:22:05.074,Mike's iconic catman is because Peter Criss claimed to have nine lives.
00:22:05.116,00:22:07.743,"Yeah, And I'm dressed as the guy who replaced Artie when he quit."
00:22:10.412,00:22:12.372,Let's give it up for the boys!
00:22:18.420,00:22:22.424,"I thought the boys' KISS number was good, although the lyrics did leave something to be desired."
00:22:22.466,00:22:26.262,And Finn kept sticking his tongue out and I couldn't stop picturing him licking stuff.
00:22:26.304,00:22:27.429,It was disturbing.
00:22:30.432,00:22:32.893,Now Gaga's got to go.
00:22:41.443,00:22:43.654,Are you serious?
00:22:46.448,00:22:48.242,They already think we're boyfriends.
00:22:48.284,00:22:50.077,Let them think what they want.
00:22:53.455,00:22:55.333,Don't you get it?
00:23:08.888,00:23:11.349,Why can't you just work harder at blending in?
00:23:13.475,00:23:15.978,"You know, it would."
00:23:23.361,00:23:25.821,You are such a boy.
00:23:25.863,00:23:29.407,You're going to have to use a moist towelette if you want to get that makeup off.
00:23:30.492,00:23:32.245,Don't touch me!
00:23:33.495,00:23:35.122,It's just a moist towelette!
00:23:38.500,00:23:40.753,I'm gonna finish in the laundry room.
00:23:51.013,00:23:52.639,"I know why you called, and don't worry about it."
00:23:56.518,00:23:58.938,I'm not worried about regionals.
00:24:00.898,00:24:02.858,She's special.
00:24:02.900,00:24:04.777,She's got all of the best of you.
00:24:04.818,00:24:08.197,"She's strong-willed, dramatic, wildly talented."
00:24:09.531,00:24:10.866,But she's not hard like you.
00:24:10.908,00:24:13.202,She's fragile.
00:24:13.244,00:24:14.370,over-emotional.
00:24:14.412,00:24:19.208,And she's clearly convinced herself that you are as committed to this reunion as she is.
00:24:19.250,00:24:21.335,And I don't think you are.
00:24:21.377,00:24:24.297,You're not prepared to have a teenage daughter.
00:24:24.338,00:24:26.006,Are you?
00:24:35.557,00:24:38.476,"Then some surgery, and that's that."
00:24:41.730,00:24:44.150,I really wanted a daughter.
00:24:47.569,00:24:50.948,That's why it was so important to me to make that bond with her.
00:24:52.366,00:24:55.535,But you're right.
00:24:55.577,00:24:59.332,I wanted my baby back.
00:24:59.373,00:25:01.125,Rachel's an adult now.
00:25:01.167,00:25:02.542,She doesn't need me.
00:25:08.506,00:25:15.513,"But if you really love her, you have to tell her what you just told me."
00:25:17.183,00:25:21.645,"KURT: I had to skip school to finish it, but I think you're really going to like it."
00:25:28.610,00:25:32.572,I used Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper in Morocco as my inspiration.
00:25:32.614,00:25:37.370,"It's a perfect blend of the masculine and the feminine, the muted and the theatrical."
00:25:37.411,00:25:39.997,Are you freaking insane?
00:25:40.622,00:25:42.791,I can't live here. I'm a dude.
00:25:44.626,00:25:47.296,What the hell is that supposed to be?
00:25:47.338,00:25:50.883,It's a privacy partition It's all I could find on such short notice.
00:25:50.924,00:25:52.385,Why are you getting angry about everything?
00:25:52.426,00:25:53.469,I worked hard on this.
00:25:53.511,00:25:55.595,That's not a privacy partition!
00:25:55.637,00:25:58.516,Why is it so hard for you to understand?
00:25:58.556,00:26:00.476,I don't want to get dressed in front of you!
00:26:00.518,00:26:06.315,Do you know that I put my underwear on in the shower before I come out when you're around?
00:26:06.357,00:26:09.776,"I just... I don't want to have to worry about that kind of stuff in my own room, man."
00:26:09.818,00:26:11.778,And what stuff are you referring to?
00:26:11.820,00:26:14.114,You know. You know what I'm talking about.
00:26:14.156,00:26:15.241,Don't play dumb.
00:26:15.282,00:26:17.659,Why can't you just accept that I'm not like you?
00:26:17.701,00:26:20.538,I have accepted that.
00:26:20.578,00:26:23.332,You think I don't see the way you stare at me?
00:26:23.374,00:26:25.000,How flirty you get.
00:26:25.042,00:26:28.546,You think I don't know why you got so excited that we were going to be moving in together?
00:26:28.586,00:26:30.548,"It's just a room, Finn!"
00:26:30.588,00:26:32.466,We can redecorate it if you want to!
00:26:32.508,00:26:33.800,"Okay, good."
00:26:33.842,00:26:38.389,"Well, then the first thing that needs to go is that faggy lamp."
00:26:40.140,00:26:41.308,Hey!
00:26:41.350,00:26:43.643,What did you just call him?
00:26:43.685,00:26:46.105,"Oh, no, no, I didn't call him anything."
00:26:46.146,00:26:47.440,I was talking to the blanket.
00:26:47.481,00:26:49.567,"If you use that word, you're talking about him."
00:26:49.607,00:26:50.734,"Relax, Dad. I didn't take it that way."
00:26:54.696,00:26:58.200,"You live a few years, you start seeing the hate in people's hearts."
00:26:59.159,00:27:00.453,Even the best people.
00:27:01.954,00:27:03.080,Of course not.
00:27:03.122,00:27:04.831,How about retard?
00:27:14.716,00:27:17.052,That's not what I meant...
00:27:17.094,00:27:20.598,"What, you think I didn't use that word when I was your age?"
00:27:20.638,00:27:26.103,"You know, some kid gets clocked in practice, we'd tell him to stop being such a fag."
00:27:27.729,00:27:31.317,We meant it exactly the way you meant it.
00:27:31.358,00:27:33.193,That being gay is wrong.
00:27:33.235,00:27:35.695,That it's some kind of punishable offense.
00:27:35.737,00:27:37.990,"I really thought you were different, Finn."
00:27:38.991,00:27:49.793,"You know, I thought that being in Glee Club and being raised by your mom meant that you were some, you know, new generation of dude who saw things differently."
00:27:57.259,00:27:59.553,I guess I was wrong.
00:28:01.263,00:28:04.016,"I'm sorry, Finn, but you can't... you can't stay here."
00:28:07.603,00:28:13.442,"And maybe this is going to cost me her, but my family comes first."
00:28:13.484,00:28:15.235,I can't have that kind of poison around.
00:28:18.405,00:28:21.450,"This is our home, Kurt."
00:28:21.492,00:28:23.994,He is my son.
00:28:26.788,00:28:31.960,"Out in the world, you do what you want, but not under my roof."
00:29:08.497,00:29:11.958,You look like you should be in orbit.
00:29:12.000,00:29:13.377,Been there.
00:29:13.419,00:29:15.212,I want to talk about this.
00:29:17.839,00:29:21.468,I feel sorry for you.
00:29:24.846,00:29:27.266,"WILL: All right, let's get things started."
00:29:27.307,00:29:28.475,Mr. Shue.
00:29:28.517,00:29:30.561,There's something I want to say to Quinn.
00:29:31.853,00:29:33.188,And I want everybody to hear it.
00:29:33.230,00:29:35.274,All right.
00:29:36.108,00:29:44.575,"At first I didn't really get this theatrical assignment-- being larger than life and putting it all out there, 'cause I'm kind of like that all the time."
00:29:46.159,00:29:48.621,"That's how my dad was, too."
00:29:48.662,00:29:52.541,He was too busy being all crazy and rock and roll to be there for his kid.
00:29:56.462,00:29:58.880,I just wanted him to be there.
00:29:58.922,00:30:00.257,And he never was.
00:30:01.258,00:30:11.017,"And then I learned all this KISS stuff and while Jackie Daniels is a great name for like a powerboat or something, it's not right for a baby girl."
00:30:11.059,00:30:16.273,"So if my KISS mates will help me out, I got a better idea."
00:30:18.150,00:30:19.735,"Grab a stool, guys."
00:33:00.687,00:33:07.736,"I know you're giving her up, but before you do, I think you should name her Beth."
00:33:13.659,00:33:15.702,I'd really like to meet her.
00:33:31.468,00:33:35.263,"So, how'd your dads come up with the name Rachel?"
00:33:46.107,00:33:47.860,to say good-bye.
00:33:47.901,00:33:51.905,I really wanted this to work.
00:33:55.325,00:33:57.703,Do you know what really turned me?
00:33:57.744,00:34:05.544,"That story that you told me about your dads, and how they'd bring you water when you were sad."
00:34:05.585,00:34:07.671,We're never gonna have anything like that.
00:34:07.713,00:34:10.924,It's too late for us.
00:34:10.966,00:34:16.054,I just think that anything we share right now is gonna be confusing for you.
00:34:18.181,00:34:19.683,I just don't understand.
00:34:19.725,00:34:21.100,You're my mom.
00:34:21.142,00:34:30.109,"I feel awful right now, and I should want to just fall into your arms and let you rock me and tell me everything is gonna be fine, but..."
00:34:30.151,00:34:32.863,I just don't feel it.
00:34:34.823,00:34:39.578,"It's because I'm your mother, but I'm not your mom."
00:34:42.247,00:34:46.626,So what? Do we just pretend we don't know each other now?
00:34:48.211,00:34:50.756,That seems silly.
00:34:50.797,00:34:54.634,Let's just be grateful for one another...
00:34:56.177,00:34:57.387,For a while.
00:34:57.429,00:35:01.307,Don't think for a second I'm gonna go soft on you during regionals.
00:35:07.814,00:35:10.275,Can I have a hug good-bye?
00:35:47.104,00:35:50.398,can you get yourself some water from this cup?
00:35:50.440,00:35:55.153,Gold stars are kinda my thing.
00:36:06.247,00:36:08.291,Shelby...
00:36:08.333,00:36:12.253,"before you go, will..."
00:36:12.295,00:36:14.673,will you sing with me?
00:36:15.632,00:36:17.425,Just one time.
00:36:17.467,00:36:23.389,"It's sort of a fantasy of mine, and it would really mean a lot to me."
00:36:28.561,00:36:31.064,He's always just around.
00:36:35.276,00:36:36.444,Here you go.
00:37:51.519,00:40:16.289,"BOTH: BOTH: You are really, really good."
00:40:35.516,00:40:37.269,Whoa!
00:40:37.310,00:40:39.312,"Guys, why are you all in your theatricality costumes?"
00:40:39.354,00:40:41.647,It's the end of the week.
00:40:43.524,00:40:46.152,"Well, um..."
00:40:46.194,00:40:50.531,"you guys have had some great numbers this week, but I'm not totally sure that I know either."
00:40:52.325,00:40:53.368,I do.
00:40:53.410,00:40:56.662,I refuse to dress like somebody I'm not to be somebody I'm not.
00:40:56.704,00:41:00.625,And I learned it's good to be a little theatrical.
00:41:06.547,00:41:10.427,And Asian vampires are the most vicious of all the vampires.
00:41:15.556,00:41:17.516,He's really pissed.
00:41:17.558,00:41:18.517,Is that what you want?
00:41:20.561,00:41:22.521,Good. I'm glad we had this talk.
00:41:22.563,00:41:26.692,Now I have to go back to my coffin because the light is burning my eyes!
00:41:26.734,00:41:28.527,There she is.
00:41:32.240,00:41:33.658,Wait. Where's Kurt?
00:41:37.578,00:41:38.537,You want to hit me?
00:41:38.579,00:41:40.165,You want to beat me up?
00:41:46.504,00:41:49.548,"So go ahead, hit me."
00:41:50.591,00:41:51.968,"Sir, would you like to go first?"
00:41:52.010,00:41:54.679,FINN: You're not hitting anyone.
00:41:57.390,00:41:58.724,"Oh, my God."
00:42:00.601,00:42:01.853,"I want to thank you, Kurt."
00:42:01.894,00:42:07.650,"I realize I still have a lot to learn, but the reason I'm here right now..."
00:42:07.692,00:42:11.779,"in a shower curtain, is... because of you."
00:42:13.323,00:42:15.450,And I'm not going to let anyone lay a hand on you.
00:42:15.492,00:42:17.160,"Oh, really, dude?"
00:42:17.202,00:42:19.578,'Cause I'm pretty sure we can take both of you.
00:42:19.620,00:42:21.164,PUCK: Yeah?
00:42:23.624,00:42:25.168,"Okay, I get it."
00:42:25.210,00:42:27.086,I took biology.
00:42:27.128,00:42:28.380,We done disturbed the freak hive.
00:42:28.421,00:42:31.299,The worker freaks is trying to protect the queen freak.
00:42:31.341,00:42:33.592,Next time...
00:42:33.634,00:42:35.803,"we'll bring some friends, too."
00:42:39.932,00:42:42.060,I'm tired of everyone calling us freaks.
00:42:42.101,00:42:44.312,"Well, look at us."
00:42:45.813,00:42:47.690,But we're all freaks together.
00:42:47.732,00:42:51.194,And we shouldn't have to hide it.
00:42:55.156,00:42:56.824,"Nice job, Finn."
00:42:56.866,00:42:59.618,I think you just figured out what the lesson was.
00:42:59.660,00:43:01.620,Kinda makes me wish I had planned it.
00:43:01.662,00:43:03.039,But Mercedes is right.
00:43:03.081,00:43:05.624,You do all look incredibly insane.
00:43:05.666,00:43:07.626,Thank you.
00:43:07.668,00:43:12.673,"WILL: Anyways, let's get back to work before you're all forced to join the circus."
00:43:12.715,00:43:14.717,Next stop? Regionals.
00:00:01.877,00:00:07.549,"So here's what you missed on Glee: Regionals is coming up and Jessie's left the glee club, and though it seems like he might be a spy, he also seems to really like Rachel, which is confusing."
00:00:07.591,00:00:09.844,I think I kind of like her.
00:00:09.885,00:00:12.429,Quinn's preggo and feels like she's totally alone.
00:00:16.099,00:00:17.142,"I mean, she's not terrible."
00:00:18.769,00:00:20.896,Sorry.
00:00:24.692,00:00:27.862,"MERCEDES: Is it just me, or does it feel like we have a real shot at Regionals next month?"
00:00:27.903,00:00:31.448,The Ohio Show Choir chat rooms have all been buzzing about how Vocal Adrenaline has lost a step.
00:00:36.119,00:00:39.707,You guys have to come to the auditorium-- it's an emergency!
00:00:45.754,00:00:48.173,Jessie?
00:00:52.636,00:00:57.098,"I'm sorry that it's come to this, but you guys were awful to me."
00:00:57.140,00:01:00.310,"You never accepted me, you never listened to my clearly superior ideas."
00:01:00.352,00:01:02.730,Why are you here in our auditorium?
00:01:02.771,00:01:06.149,"The blogs and the chat rooms say that we're finished, and that you guys are ripe to topple us."
00:01:22.082,00:01:24.710,"Ooh, let's go."
00:02:16.428,00:02:19.014,"Thanks for letting us borrow your auditorium, guys."
00:02:19.056,00:02:20.348,It's quaint.
00:02:38.033,00:02:40.869,They psych out the competition a few weeks before the big show.
00:02:40.911,00:02:42.370,They call it a funkification.
00:02:42.412,00:02:45.624,"Meaning they show us what they've got, and we spiral into a deep black funk."
00:02:45.666,00:02:48.836,"Yeah. Yeah, we used to do the same thing to other football teams."
00:02:54.675,00:02:55.592,Those guys are golden.
00:02:55.634,00:02:57.218,"KURT: Come on, keep your heads up, guys."
00:03:08.313,00:03:10.065,TINA: I feel so violated.
00:03:10.107,00:03:11.650,It's like someone broke into our home.
00:03:13.944,00:03:17.614,And the fact that they're trying to get to us means maybe we got them spooked.
00:03:17.656,00:03:20.075,"Uh-uh, Mr. Shue."
00:03:22.285,00:03:23.495,"You know, which doesn't make any sense."
00:03:26.081,00:03:27.124,I gave 'em all keys.
00:03:32.921,00:03:35.423,That'll open up the space a little bit.
00:03:56.361,00:04:00.699,Except I'll be wanting far fewer morbidly obese white women waddling around and crying.
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.793,"In a few weeks, Glee Club will be finished."
00:04:11.835,00:04:13.212,Now how do I know that?
00:04:13.253,00:04:19.300,"Well, I recently checked the odds with my Vegas bookie, who told me that you're 40-1 underdogs at Regionals."
00:04:19.342,00:04:22.137,"You are going to lose, and your dreams will be crushed."
00:04:23.847,00:04:25.099,"Sure, Will."
00:04:35.358,00:04:38.904,"You can try to get rid of them, but they just keep coming."
00:04:45.368,00:04:46.620,Enjoy your last few days here.
00:04:46.661,00:04:49.330,This room is mine.
00:04:54.002,00:04:58.257,"So you sign here, and here."
00:04:58.298,00:05:01.969,And you sign here and here.
00:05:29.663,00:05:32.791,Well...
00:05:32.833,00:05:40.590,"By the power vested in me by the bar association of the great State of Ohio, I know pronounce you no longer husband and wife."
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.534,You always will be.
00:06:25.052,00:06:29.097,"All right, guys, today I want to talk to you about regrets."
00:06:30.473,00:06:34.811,"Giving my heart to Jessie, just to have it crushed like the stage floor at a performance of Stomp."
00:06:34.853,00:06:38.148,Thinking trust me was a sensible birth control option.
00:06:38.190,00:06:39.233,We all have them.
00:06:39.274,00:06:41.235,I just finalized my divorce.
00:06:41.276,00:06:43.653,I regret living in a relationship that wasn't working.
00:06:48.158,00:06:50.827,"Besides creeping us out, why are you telling us this?"
00:06:50.869,00:06:56.166,"Because if we lose to Vocal Adrenaline at Regionals, none of us are going to regret it."
00:06:56.208,00:06:58.835,We will have given it our best shot and we won't look back.
00:06:58.877,00:07:03.422,But we will regret letting them get the best of us before the competition.
00:07:03.464,00:07:06.134,Which is why we need to hit them back just like they hit us.
00:07:06.176,00:07:10.264,So you want us to TP their choir room?
00:07:10.305,00:07:12.515,"Whatever the better, cooler version of that is."
00:07:12.557,00:07:16.728,"Like, uh, maybe-maybe we should steal their school statue."
00:07:16.770,00:07:21.816,Their school statue is a giant bronze of a great white shark eating a seal pup.
00:07:24.527,00:07:25.862,"Okay, how about this one."
00:07:25.904,00:07:27.530,"All right, we get like..."
00:07:27.572,00:07:29.074,PUCK: Everyone knows this is going to come down to me.
00:07:33.120,00:07:34.955,These are my kingdoms.
00:07:38.250,00:07:46.925,"Finn and I may still hate each other for some reason, but we both know that defending the honor of New Directions is going to be our dirty job."
00:07:54.808,00:07:56.059,"Yeah, I did it."
00:07:56.101,00:07:58.228,And I'm proud. All I did was step up and be a man.
00:08:00.230,00:08:01.440,A few of my students TP'd your choir room.
00:08:06.236,00:08:07.612,Those were gifts for our win at Sectionals.
00:08:07.654,00:08:09.990,That's 200 times 26 times four equals...
00:08:13.576,00:08:15.120,We have a very active booster club.
00:08:16.371,00:08:17.622,It was a harmless prank.
00:08:24.587,00:08:27.715,"He successfully ignited its flatulence and a city burned, William."
00:08:33.596,00:08:35.556,These students have committed a felony.
00:08:35.598,00:08:37.225,They are hereby expelled.
00:08:37.267,00:08:41.355,"Look, I don't want anyone to get expelled."
00:08:41.396,00:08:43.023,I'm not going to press charges...
00:08:44.649,00:08:47.027,You can take it out of the glee club budget.
00:08:47.068,00:08:48.069,That'll bankrupt the glee club.
00:08:49.612,00:08:50.571,We'll get jobs.
00:08:50.613,00:08:52.157,Give us a month.
00:08:52.199,00:08:54.951,"We'll pay you back, Ms. Corcoran, I promise."
00:08:56.619,00:09:01.541,"Ms. Corcoran, you are as wise and magnanimous as you are beautiful."
00:09:03.710,00:09:07.172,Thank you.
00:09:07.214,00:09:08.798,"Well, you just can't win, can you, William?"
00:09:08.840,00:09:11.843,"You never have, and you never will."
00:09:18.016,00:09:21.019,"Are you sure you want to take a trip down that rabbit hole, William?"
00:09:25.648,00:09:27.401,I don't sell to the clinically depressed.
00:09:27.442,00:09:31.612,You'll throw yourself off a parking garage and I can't have that on my conscience.
00:09:35.700,00:09:39.120,You think Carmel High didn't put the fear of God in me?
00:10:00.350,00:10:01.893,Use it in a sentence.
00:10:01.935,00:10:03.144,Come on.
00:10:03.186,00:10:05.021,Rachel.
00:10:05.063,00:10:07.232,This cheese smells funky.
00:10:07.274,00:10:08.525,That's because it's from-unda cheese.
00:10:09.859,00:10:10.860,"Okay, okay."
00:10:10.902,00:10:12.695,I was thinking more along the lines of...
00:10:12.737,00:10:14.822,Vocal Adrenaline has sure put us all in a funk.
00:10:14.864,00:10:17.451,"I'm so depressed, I've worn the same outfit twice this week."
00:10:17.492,00:10:21.329,What if I told you I knew how we could shove it right back down their throats?
00:10:24.707,00:10:26.960,We are going to get funked up.
00:10:29.712,00:10:32.257,Vocal Adrenaline has never once done a funk number.
00:10:32.299,00:10:37.387,"They're a machine, a collective, synthesized, soulless beat."
00:10:37.429,00:10:39.055,Funk is soul meets anger.
00:10:39.097,00:10:40.848,Its passion is in its emotion.
00:10:40.890,00:10:43.393,And Vocal Adrenaline doesn't perform with any.
00:10:49.732,00:10:52.735,"You guys can relax, I got this one covered."
00:10:52.777,00:10:53.945,Cool.
00:10:53.987,00:10:54.988,Hold on a second.
00:10:58.950,00:11:00.701,"Good one, Quinn."
00:11:00.743,00:11:02.496,It even sounds funny when you say it.
00:11:02.537,00:11:05.290,You said funk was about soul and anger.
00:11:06.749,00:11:08.709,Look at me. Look at my life.
00:11:10.753,00:11:15.300,"When white people try to be funky, you end up with KC and the Sunshine Band."
00:11:15.342,00:11:16.510,I love Boogie Shoes.
00:11:16.551,00:11:20.805,"Mercedes' racism aside, I will have something prepared tomorrow."
00:11:20.847,00:11:22.849,"All right, Quinn goes first."
00:11:36.154,00:11:37.738,"Jessie, cared about you."
00:11:37.780,00:11:39.157,"No, he didn't."
00:11:39.199,00:11:41.909,Our entire relationship was just some diabolical plan.
00:11:49.792,00:11:53.921,It's textbook; you destroy the heart of the team's heart and you destroy the team.
00:11:53.963,00:12:00.554,"WILL: Sandy told me how to beat Vocal Adrenaline, and now Rachel was inadvertently telling me how to beat my other nemesis."
00:12:00.595,00:12:03.931,"Suddenly, I wasn't feeling nearly as depressed."
00:12:05.724,00:12:08.353,"William, I'm gonna have to ask you to clear out."
00:12:08.395,00:12:13.358,I received an anonymous tip from someone who wants to meet me here to discuss an illegal Hot Cheetos ring.
00:12:13.400,00:12:18.405,"Hot Cheetos have been proven to raise endorphins, which makes for happy kids, and I can't have that."
00:12:18.446,00:12:19.573,"Yeah, no worries, Sue."
00:12:19.614,00:12:20.865,I'll just find someplace else to...
00:12:20.907,00:12:23.660,"Oh, wow."
00:12:23.702,00:12:23.993,What?
00:12:33.836,00:12:39.718,"Well, the week before Nationals every year, I have a placenta mask right after a rigorous session of microdermabrasion."
00:12:39.758,00:12:46.765,"Well, whatever you're doing, keep it up because you have never looked better."
00:12:49.227,00:12:51.646,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I should..."
00:12:51.688,00:12:52.855,"I got stuff to do, so..."
00:12:52.897,00:12:55.900,"Look, Sue, I gotta ask your advice about something."
00:12:55.942,00:13:02.490,"I know I make it seem like I-I know what I'm doing, but everyone knows you're the kingmaker around here."
00:13:02.532,00:13:04.618,"I mean, you're this school's arbiter of taste."
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.419,Okay.
00:14:59.982,00:15:01.526,So...
00:15:01.568,00:15:03.152,you feel anything there?
00:15:03.194,00:15:04.945,No.
00:15:04.987,00:15:06.947,Was I...
00:15:06.989,00:15:08.115,too dirty?
00:15:12.620,00:15:14.622,Okay.
00:15:27.009,00:15:29.554,"Right, left, and flip, okay?"
00:15:29.596,00:15:30.889,Can I go shirtless under this apron?
00:15:44.277,00:15:47.447,"Anyway, I'm on my own now."
00:15:47.488,00:15:53.244,And I need to make manager by the end of the year so that I can maintain my lifestyle.
00:15:53.286,00:15:57.791,"Terri, that guy who gave me Bell's palsy is back again today."
00:15:57.832,00:15:58.792,So...
00:15:58.833,00:16:00.042,help him.
00:16:00.084,00:16:01.961,He's our best customer.
00:16:03.630,00:16:05.172,You need to go help him.
00:16:07.049,00:16:11.011,"I have got seniority over you two losers, which means you have to do what I say."
00:16:11.053,00:16:12.388,"Well, then I need to kick your ass."
00:16:12.430,00:16:14.641,MAN: Bamboo...!
00:16:17.435,00:16:20.563,You two... apron boys.
00:16:23.900,00:16:28.529,I've recently redone my bathroom as an homage to Miss Jayne Mansfield.
00:16:29.071,00:16:31.198,Pink! It's all pink!
00:16:34.076,00:16:37.121,But this is all the pink that we have.
00:16:37.163,00:16:38.498,Wrong answer.
00:16:38.539,00:16:41.835,Did they change the name of this place to Losers N' Things?
00:16:41.876,00:16:46.965,Did everyone in the whole world die so they had to give these jobs to you two morons?
00:16:47.006,00:16:48.257,And where's my Muzak?!
00:16:48.299,00:16:51.051,How am I supposed to shop without my Kenny G?
00:16:51.093,00:16:53.888,Let's go!
00:16:55.181,00:16:56.474,Crank it!
00:17:47.567,00:17:48.609,Yo.
00:17:49.443,00:17:51.111,HOWARD: Cut it.
00:18:11.257,00:18:14.719,I thought Jews were supposed to be smart.
00:18:29.191,00:18:30.401,Mrs. Schuester?
00:18:30.443,00:18:32.194,Oh. I'm sorry.
00:18:32.236,00:18:34.113,"Yes, sure. Of course."
00:18:35.406,00:18:37.867,How old are you?
00:18:43.664,00:18:47.752,"SUE: Dear Journal, Something strange happened yesterday."
00:18:47.794,00:18:50.588,I felt something below the neck.
00:18:50.630,00:18:52.840,Dare I admit it?
00:18:52.882,00:18:55.342,I have feelings for one Will Schuester.
00:18:55.384,00:18:57.971,"Sexy, non-murdering feelings."
00:18:58.012,00:19:00.180,"Oh, it all makes sense now, Journal."
00:19:00.222,00:19:03.977,True love always springs from true hate.
00:19:04.018,00:19:12.359,"I'll admit, in the past, I've fantasized about waking up with Will's head on the pillow next to me, except now I picture it attached to the rest of his body."
00:19:13.235,00:19:15.655,"Sue, you got a sec?"
00:19:24.246,00:19:26.040,Those are cheap gas station flowers.
00:19:26.082,00:19:27.207,I-I have no interest.
00:19:27.249,00:19:29.209,Okay.
00:19:29.251,00:19:32.046,But I also got you these.
00:19:35.508,00:19:38.469,I had to drive to Dayton to get your favorite flavor.
00:19:38.511,00:19:41.848,Appletini.
00:19:43.641,00:19:48.729,"I don't get it either, Sue, but you can't deny that we have chemistry."
00:19:48.771,00:19:52.608,My divorce opened my eyes to a world of possibilities.
00:19:52.650,00:19:57.237,I thought I'd finally have the chance to have all the things I'd ever wanted.
00:19:57.279,00:20:02.076,"And then I realized, the only thing I want..."
00:20:02.118,00:20:03.536,is Sue.
00:20:16.298,00:20:17.299,How's Wednesday night?
00:20:17.341,00:20:19.385,Breadstix?
00:20:21.888,00:20:24.682,Good.
00:20:26.392,00:20:28.477,"You know what Wednesday is, right?"
00:20:30.980,00:20:33.399,Hump day.
00:20:45.578,00:20:48.622,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Schuester, my heart's not in this."
00:20:55.337,00:20:56.839,Glee?!
00:20:57.339,00:20:58.799,God!
00:20:58.841,00:21:01.010,This club is like toxic mold on my life.
00:21:03.345,00:21:05.514,I'm sorry.
00:21:07.225,00:21:08.726,What am I doing?
00:21:08.768,00:21:11.520,This is exactly how I destroyed my marriage.
00:21:11.562,00:21:15.566,I have this compulsive need to crush other people's dreams.
00:21:15.608,00:21:17.151,"Yeah, that's what Mr. Shue said."
00:21:17.944,00:21:20.320,"I mean, I think you're awesome, though."
00:21:20.362,00:21:25.243,"I mean, look how hard you've been working to try and help me fold a sham."
00:21:33.375,00:21:35.461,You could be my second chance.
00:21:36.378,00:21:38.005,I'm gonna change.
00:21:41.383,00:21:43.803,"Yeah. Yeah, right, I guess."
00:21:43.844,00:21:46.388,"Well, then I am going to help you with your Glee assignment."
00:21:48.641,00:21:51.060,"Okay, you said you needed a funk song, right?"
00:21:51.102,00:21:53.646,Yeah.
00:21:57.399,00:21:59.359,I never thought of that.
00:21:59.401,00:22:03.530,"Oh, Howard, I'm promoting Finn to assistant assistant manager."
00:22:03.572,00:22:05.407,You'll report to him from now on.
00:22:05.449,00:22:07.534,Do you have a problem with that?
00:22:11.122,00:22:12.873,"Wow, thanks."
00:22:12.915,00:22:14.834,"I believe in you, Finn."
00:22:30.599,00:22:34.561,"When you're pregnant, you're responsible for two lives."
00:22:34.603,00:22:38.649,And you're walking down the hallway oppressed by the man.
00:22:41.110,00:22:42.820,Hearing people call you fat.
00:22:43.445,00:22:45.031,Sometimes it hurts.
00:22:45.072,00:22:51.578,Sometimes you have to stop and hold that precious life and say no.
00:22:51.620,00:22:53.122,This is offensive.
00:22:54.456,00:22:56.000,We're the Unwed Mothership Connection.
00:22:56.042,00:22:59.045,And that's what we're here to sing about.
00:25:37.036,00:25:39.372,You're going to have to order something.
00:25:39.413,00:25:41.248,My date will be here any minute.
00:25:41.290,00:25:42.875,Your date's not coming.
00:25:55.553,00:25:57.431,Right on time.
00:26:00.518,00:26:01.685,You led me on.
00:26:06.690,00:26:08.692,"Gosh, Sue, I wonder where I learned how to do all that."
00:26:08.734,00:26:14.656,"You meddled around in my marriage, you terrorize the glee club, you continue to sabotage my relationship with Emma."
00:26:17.493,00:26:20.329,Cruelty was the only way to get your attention.
00:26:20.371,00:26:22.664,"I have no interest in dating you, Sue."
00:26:22.706,00:26:24.875,You're a bully and you're mean to kids.
00:26:24.917,00:26:26.335,I'm mean to everyone.
00:26:31.549,00:26:34.218,"Now, if you'll excuse me."
00:26:34.260,00:26:36.095,"This is uncalled for, William."
00:26:37.054,00:26:39.098,"Good night, Sue."
00:26:45.687,00:26:48.357,"Santana, are you all right?"
00:26:48.399,00:26:50.109,What...?
00:27:01.703,00:27:03.497,We haven't had practice in days.
00:27:03.539,00:27:07.543,"I'm fine because I have Glee, but these girls have sort of lost it."
00:27:07.585,00:27:10.670,No Nationals means that four of the girls will lose their college scholarships.
00:27:10.712,00:27:12.672,And the rest are just depressed and confused.
00:27:15.717,00:27:24.560,"It's really hard to feel bad for Sue Sylvester-- she doesn't need another trophy-- but some of these girls, they really do."
00:27:27.729,00:27:32.692,"FINN: Mr. Shue, Puck and I would like to show the class the true meaning of funk."
00:27:32.734,00:27:36.489,With a little help from our special guest Mercedes.
00:27:36.530,00:27:37.697,Whoo.
00:27:37.739,00:27:39.366,"Fasten your seat belts, people."
00:27:39.408,00:27:40.951,It's going to be a funky ride.
00:28:47.809,00:28:48.768,"Finnie D, break it down."
00:29:35.441,00:29:37.317,A kick-butt old school rap song.
00:29:37.359,00:29:39.319,"ARTIE: Does it really matter, Mr. Shue?"
00:29:42.864,00:29:44.950,We're in a deeper funk than ever.
00:29:52.374,00:29:56.836,"Mercedes, I'm so sorry."
00:30:00.882,00:30:02.635,For nine months.
00:30:02.676,00:30:07.013,You've had to deal with this your whole life.
00:30:07.055,00:30:10.643,"People making assumptions, calling you names."
00:30:10.684,00:30:15.855,I seriously can't understand why don't feel like yelling at people all the time.
00:30:15.897,00:30:18.358,What's the point in getting angry?
00:30:18.400,00:30:19.859,Because it's infuriating.
00:30:19.901,00:30:22.362,I hate all the looks at school.
00:30:22.404,00:30:25.699,Don't even get me started on Puck's mom.
00:30:25.741,00:30:27.867,You're not angry.
00:30:27.909,00:30:29.369,You're hurt.
00:30:29.411,00:30:32.665,You just need someplace safe where you can dig through all that rage.
00:30:32.706,00:30:35.501,Get to the pain beneath it.
00:30:41.923,00:30:43.883,I already talked to my mom about it.
00:30:43.925,00:30:47.262,My brother went off to college and we have an extra room.
00:30:48.930,00:30:50.683,It's cool.
00:30:50.724,00:30:53.811,"Us sisters got to stick together, right?"
00:31:06.114,00:31:08.116,Mr. Schuester?
00:31:08.158,00:31:09.951,Come in.
00:31:14.623,00:31:16.834,Never seen her like this.
00:31:16.875,00:31:19.294,"She won't leave her room, and refuses her protein shakes."
00:31:20.962,00:31:23.923,Very bad.
00:31:23.965,00:31:25.342,Let me ask.
00:31:25.384,00:31:26.885,Thank you.
00:31:29.388,00:31:30.764,Careful.
00:31:30.806,00:31:32.432,That Regionals '85.
00:31:32.474,00:31:34.100,Very precious to Ms. Sue.
00:31:34.142,00:31:35.602,Sorry.
00:31:37.437,00:31:39.314,"Mija, Mr. Schuester is here."
00:31:39.356,00:31:41.191,SUE: Okay.
00:31:42.150,00:31:43.736,She agreed to see you.
00:31:43.777,00:31:45.445,"Oh, gracias por tu ayuda."
00:31:45.487,00:31:46.905,De nada.
00:31:56.498,00:31:59.668,"I, uh..."
00:31:59.710,00:32:02.212,"I hear you're pulling out of Nationals, Sue."
00:32:02.254,00:32:06.466,"You know, for some of your girls that's going to have some really big consequences."
00:32:06.508,00:32:07.760,I'm tired of those kids.
00:32:07.801,00:32:08.968,I devoted my life to them.
00:32:11.012,00:32:15.058,Five consecutive National championships.
00:32:15.100,00:32:16.810,"Oh, big deal."
00:32:19.020,00:32:23.149,I don't even like you and I was willing to jump at the chance to be with you.
00:32:23.191,00:32:29.239,"And, you know, for a second, I saw a flash of something."
00:32:34.035,00:32:36.955,Having someone to come home to every night.
00:32:39.541,00:32:45.798,"And though I completely loathe you, you'd make a great trophy husband."
00:32:45.839,00:32:50.427,"And as you can see by my decor, I love me some trophies."
00:32:53.305,00:32:57.601,I thought destroying you would pull me out of my funk.
00:32:57.643,00:33:01.396,But... just made things worse.
00:33:05.066,00:33:07.110,"Yes, it is."
00:33:07.152,00:33:09.738,"And you're not alone, Sue."
00:33:09.780,00:33:14.033,"Your kids need you, so you do have love in your life."
00:33:14.075,00:33:16.035,My kids don't love me; they fear me.
00:33:16.077,00:33:18.997,"But you love them, Sue."
00:33:24.294,00:33:27.005,"Hand me my bullhorn, will you?"
00:33:33.094,00:33:34.638,Amelda!
00:33:34.680,00:33:36.222,Make me a shake!
00:33:36.264,00:33:37.265,To go!
00:33:37.307,00:33:38.433,AMELDA: Hooray.
00:33:38.475,00:33:40.059,Make it two.
00:33:49.110,00:33:49.945,Hello.
00:33:49.987,00:33:52.739,JESSIE: Meet me out in the parking lot.
00:34:34.656,00:34:37.283,The souls of those poor egg fetuses are all on your conscience now.
00:34:38.159,00:34:40.662,"Do it, Jessie."
00:34:53.967,00:34:55.761,Do it.
00:34:55.802,00:34:58.055,Break it like you broke my heart.
00:34:58.096,00:35:00.098,I loved you.
00:35:28.209,00:35:29.419,"Oh, this is bull!"
00:35:29.461,00:35:31.170,"Finn, Mike, Matt, come with me."
00:35:33.214,00:35:35.092,"Hey, what's going on?"
00:35:35.133,00:35:36.969,We're on our way to go all Braveheart on Vocal Adrenaline.
00:35:37.010,00:35:38.887,"Guys, violence is never the answer."
00:35:38.929,00:35:42.390,It is when the question is What's the best way to mess up that Jessie kid's face?!
00:35:43.850,00:35:46.019,We're the only ones who get to humiliate her.
00:35:46.061,00:35:47.395,Stop!
00:35:47.437,00:35:50.107,Get back here and sit down!
00:35:52.400,00:35:56.362,"Look, I know from experience that making someone else suffer doesn't make your pain go away."
00:35:56.404,00:35:59.992,"You're all amazing, no matter what Vocal Adrenaline says or does."
00:36:00.033,00:36:01.910,We just need to find a way to remind ourselves of that.
00:36:05.246,00:36:06.581,We're not.
00:36:06.623,00:36:10.168,"Rachel, dial Jessie's number on your phone."
00:36:12.253,00:36:15.423,SANTANA: You haven't deleted his number yet?
00:36:15.465,00:36:17.009,Jessie St. James?
00:36:17.050,00:36:22.139,"You and Vocal Adrenaline need to meet at our auditorium Friday, 3:00 sharp."
00:36:22.180,00:36:27.019,BRETT PAXTON: Let's hear it from the internationally ranked Cheerios coach Sue Sylvester.
00:36:32.315,00:36:33.441,"Thanks, Brett, I am."
00:36:33.483,00:36:43.242,"Sue, let us know about the decision you made to have Kurt Hummel here do a 14-and-a-half minute Celine Dion medley, entirely in French."
00:36:43.284,00:36:47.622,"Well, I'll tell you what, Brett, I'm all about finding a freakish, depressed kid and showing him what winning is all about."
00:36:57.298,00:37:00.177,I know just the place.
00:37:17.110,00:37:18.904,"I'm sorry, Mr. Shue."
00:37:23.700,00:37:25.577,"I'll do the talking, thank you very much."
00:37:25.618,00:37:27.704,"Let me break it down for you, William."
00:37:40.633,00:37:42.177,And what's choice number two?
00:37:43.344,00:37:45.013,You can kiss me...
00:37:45.972,00:37:48.850,...right here on the lips...
00:37:50.185,00:37:52.187,...with tongue.
00:37:53.646,00:37:55.815,"This is payback, isn't it?"
00:38:00.361,00:38:01.988,No one will know?
00:38:03.531,00:38:06.868,Fine.
00:38:13.374,00:38:15.085,I'm not gonna do this.
00:38:15.961,00:38:19.547,Even your breath stinks of mediocrity.
00:38:19.589,00:38:21.758,It's making me sick.
00:39:04.425,00:39:06.886,RACHEL: Thanks for coming.
00:39:06.928,00:39:15.979,"After your brazen escalation of our growing dispute, which we were willing to put to rest, we decided the only way to truly funkify you is to show you the one thing we know you can't do."
00:39:16.021,00:39:17.689,So enjoy.
00:41:04.379,00:41:43.376,MERCEDES: MERCEDES: See you punks at Regionals.
00:41:44.585,00:41:46.545,They did a funk number.
00:41:46.587,00:41:49.590,We've never been able to pull off a funk number.
00:41:49.632,00:41:52.718,"Well, that's because we're soulless automatons."
00:41:52.760,00:41:54.762,I'm so depressed.
00:00:01.961,00:00:08.926,"So I don't know why anyone would miss an episode of Glee, but here's what's been happening in case you did: Quinn's parents found out she's pregnant so they kicked her out."
00:00:10.093,00:00:11.345,You move in with me.
00:00:11.386,00:00:19.478,"Jessie dropped Rachel and McKinley and the New Directions and he's back on Vocal Adrenaline which freaked everybody out and convinced them they can't beat them at Regionals and if they don't place at Regionals, the club is over, which would be awful."
00:00:19.520,00:00:21.396,And that's what you missed on Glee.
00:00:30.113,00:00:32.449,"Hey, buddy, see you on Saturday."
00:00:32.491,00:00:33.868,Wait. What?
00:00:35.118,00:00:36.244,I'm one of the judges.
00:00:39.957,00:00:41.458,You cannot allow this to happen!
00:00:43.126,00:00:46.087,I have no control over what the Show Choir Governing Board says or does.
00:00:46.129,00:00:47.882,"Let me break it down for you, Will."
00:00:53.428,00:00:58.893,"Now I realize my cultural ascendance only serves to illuminate your own banality, but face it."
00:01:00.811,00:01:04.105,"Do you have any idea how hard my kids have been working, Sue?"
00:01:04.147,00:01:05.482,"I have to be honest, Will."
00:01:05.524,00:01:12.031,I'm having a really difficult time hearing anything you have to say today because your hair looks like a briar patch.
00:01:18.203,00:01:19.705,"Principal Figgins, I am begging you."
00:01:19.747,00:01:22.123,Do not let her do this to those kids.
00:01:25.419,00:01:27.337,"You leaked our set list at Sectionals, Sue."
00:01:28.839,00:01:30.007,I will not let you do this.
00:01:30.049,00:01:32.426,We have worked ourselves to the bone to get where we are.
00:01:45.230,00:01:47.148,"Good luck with that, Will."
00:02:00.579,00:02:02.163,I can't do this.
00:02:02.205,00:02:03.373,"Yes, you can."
00:02:05.208,00:02:07.168,I'm president of the Celibacy Club.
00:02:07.210,00:02:08.462,I took a vow.
00:02:12.215,00:02:13.216,He's your best friend.
00:02:13.258,00:02:14.635,Come on. We're in high school.
00:02:14.676,00:02:18.680,You think either one of us is going to give a damn about Finn in three years?
00:02:21.516,00:02:24.812,You don't get a medal at the finish line for being good.
00:02:27.230,00:02:28.857,"Okay, but you can't tell anybody."
00:02:28.899,00:02:31.068,I can't lose my rep.
00:02:31.110,00:02:33.236,"Our secret, baby."
00:02:34.905,00:02:37.157,"I got it, trust me."
00:02:38.742,00:02:41.244,This isn't just another hookup for me.
00:02:47.292,00:02:49.086,Tell me one more time.
00:02:49.128,00:02:51.088,You're not fat.
00:02:51.130,00:02:52.255,WILL: Quinn?
00:02:52.297,00:02:53.507,Quinn?
00:02:54.257,00:02:55.634,Are you all right?
00:03:01.640,00:03:03.934,"Oh, you need some help with those plates?"
00:03:03.976,00:03:06.020,I'm not due for a month.
00:03:10.774,00:03:12.776,Yeah.
00:03:17.656,00:03:20.199,No one wants any pizza?
00:03:21.284,00:03:23.328,"All right, well, uh, let's get started."
00:03:23.370,00:03:29.126,Thank you for coming to the first annual New Directions' Regionals' set list nominations party.
00:03:33.296,00:03:34.840,She's gonna crush us.
00:03:34.882,00:03:35.841,"Artie, you don't know that."
00:03:39.386,00:03:41.513,"Yeah, she said, I'm going to crush Glee Club."
00:03:41.555,00:03:43.306,PUCK: A whole freaking year.
00:03:43.348,00:03:45.184,All that hard work for nothing.
00:03:48.979,00:03:50.105,I'm sorry.
00:03:52.315,00:03:54.151,I just really love you guys.
00:03:54.193,00:03:57.863,You know how many Facebook friends I had before I joined Glee Club?
00:03:57.905,00:04:00.866,Two. My parents.
00:04:00.908,00:04:02.367,Rachel was right.
00:04:02.409,00:04:08.289,Being a part of something special-- it made me special.
00:04:08.331,00:04:12.252,I just can't believe it's going to be over in a week.
00:04:23.138,00:04:25.182,She has a point.
00:04:27.392,00:04:33.190,"Do you think instead of nominating songs, we can just..."
00:04:30.187,00:04:36.944,all go around the room and talk about things that we loved about Glee Club this year?
00:04:36.985,00:04:40.197,WILL: It took everything I had not to cry.
00:04:40.239,00:04:44.826,It's like they've all walked a thousand miles just to get punched in the stomach.
00:05:06.640,00:05:08.892,Do you remember why?
00:05:12.395,00:05:16.191,And isn't that what you've been drilling into their heads all year?
00:05:16.233,00:05:20.361,That that feeling is way more important than winning or losing?
00:05:25.284,00:05:26.785,I miss you.
00:05:28.411,00:05:30.497,I'm seeing someone.
00:05:31.581,00:05:33.292,What?
00:05:33.333,00:05:34.751,His-his name's Carl.
00:05:34.793,00:05:37.296,Carl... Howell.
00:05:37.336,00:05:38.546,He's my dentist.
00:05:38.588,00:05:47.681,"He's always been very impressed with my oral hygiene, and the last time I was there, he was showing me the machines that they use to sterilize their tools, and he asked me out."
00:05:49.348,00:05:51.226,We've been going out every night since then.
00:05:52.435,00:05:54.395,Sorry. I'm-I'm sorry.
00:05:54.437,00:05:56.190,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
00:05:56.231,00:05:57.858,It's fine.
00:06:08.869,00:06:11.205,"Um, no, by the way."
00:06:11.246,00:06:12.747,We haven't.
00:07:00.503,00:07:03.464,Hey! We need to talk.
00:07:06.343,00:07:10.764,We had a chance of keeping it together at Mr. Shue's until you decided to bail.
00:07:13.516,00:07:17.187,"The way you're on everyone all the time is annoying, but it's also what keeps the club motivated."
00:07:17.229,00:07:18.730,You and I are going to fix this.
00:07:18.772,00:07:21.900,"We're going to Regionals, and we're going to win this thing."
00:07:36.331,00:07:39.751,"RACHEL: Mr. Schuester, Finn and I have something we want to say to you."
00:07:39.793,00:07:41.669,Me first. Have a seat.
00:07:46.549,00:07:49.469,"Nine months ago, there were five of you in here."
00:07:50.429,00:07:51.930,And we sucked.
00:07:51.972,00:07:53.932,"I mean, we really sucked."
00:08:02.565,00:08:07.112,"And all of this, all of us will be nothing but a hazy memory."
00:08:10.157,00:08:16.913,"Someone will have to remind you of the songs we sung, the solos you got or didn't get."
00:08:16.955,00:08:27.257,"Life only really has one beginning and one end, and the rest is just a whole lot of middle."
00:08:32.595,00:08:38.143,"Now, I was going to quit once, but you guys brought me back with Don't Stop Believing."
00:08:42.272,00:08:43.773,We're doing Don't Stop at Regionals?
00:08:47.027,00:08:52.491,Because who cares what happens when we get there when the getting there has been so much fun?
00:08:56.786,00:08:59.414,You had something you wanted to say?
00:09:00.623,00:09:03.584,Just that we're all really glad you didn't become an accountant.
00:09:03.626,00:09:07.547,"Regionals, here we come."
00:09:28.651,00:09:32.113,"MALE ANNOUNCER: And now, our panel of judges."
00:09:32.155,00:09:39.662,"He's an international musical sensation, a platinum recording artist 20 times over, the inimitable Mr. Josh Groban!"
00:09:42.457,00:09:48.838,"She's a four-time Grammy winner who starred in the highest-grossing movie musical of all time, Ms. Olivia Newton-John!"
00:09:50.465,00:09:56.263,"He's a two-time local Emmy winner and broadcasting icon, WOHN news anchor Rod Remington!"
00:10:17.951,00:10:26.585,"And now, our first performance of the evening, from Westvale High in scenic Fort Wayne, Indiana, Aural Intensity!"
00:10:31.714,00:10:33.716,A mash up of Olivia Newton-John and Josh Groban.
00:10:33.758,00:10:35.469,Are you kidding me?!
00:10:35.510,00:10:39.598,"Guys, we can't get distracted by what the other teams are doing."
00:10:39.639,00:10:42.517,We just got to keep our heads in the game and focus.
00:10:44.144,00:10:45.686,Yes.
00:10:47.772,00:10:53.403,"If this is only about winning for you guys, then I owe you all an apology, because I've failed you."
00:10:53.445,00:10:56.739,"And we should just all go home, because it means we've already lost."
00:10:56.781,00:11:01.911,"Besides, we have got something that the other groups don't."
00:11:01.953,00:11:03.121,ARTIE: What?
00:11:03.163,00:11:04.289,Finn's dancing.
00:11:04.331,00:11:05.373,Right?
00:11:05.415,00:11:07.584,Now let's get out there.
00:11:08.751,00:11:10.420,Bring it in.
00:11:10.462,00:11:13.173,"Let's go, go, go, go, go and..."
00:11:29.814,00:11:38.406,"ANNOUNCER: Ladies and Gentleman, our second competitors, winner of the Central Ohio Sectional, McKinley High's New Directions!"
00:12:21.824,00:17:55.408,BOTH: RACHEL: BOTH: FINN: FINN AND RACHEL: FINN AND RACHEL: That was awesome!
00:17:55.449,00:17:57.117,"Oh, my God!"
00:17:57.159,00:17:58.786,We've got second place in the bag.
00:17:58.828,00:18:00.955,Screw that. We are going to win this!
00:18:03.165,00:18:05.835,Quinney?
00:18:06.794,00:18:08.546,Mom.
00:18:11.465,00:18:12.425,Is Dad okay...?
00:18:12.466,00:18:14.552,I came to hear you sing.
00:18:17.179,00:18:23.436,I'm-I'm so sorry I missed all the other times you performed. Were there a lot?
00:18:23.477,00:18:24.520,I left your father.
00:18:24.562,00:18:28.315,"Well, I-I... kicked him out, actually."
00:18:40.578,00:18:43.330,I can turn the guest room into a nursery.
00:18:43.372,00:18:46.000,"Oh, sweetie, say something."
00:18:48.086,00:18:50.129,My water just broke.
00:20:07.665,00:20:10.126,"Uh, right this way."
00:20:12.294,00:20:13.420,Wait! Wait!
00:21:13.355,00:21:14.899,Mommy!
00:21:16.943,00:21:18.318,QUINN: Ooh!
00:21:33.375,00:21:35.962,"It's never coming, ever!"
00:21:36.378,00:21:38.589,Shut up!
00:21:39.632,00:21:42.051,"Ooh, you suck! You suck!"
00:21:51.978,00:21:53.146,"Come on, Quinney."
00:22:30.933,00:22:32.559,Let me go!
00:22:43.321,00:22:45.865,No! No! No! No! No! No!
00:22:51.954,00:22:53.789,"Come on, Quinn, push."
00:24:42.189,00:24:44.191,Hi. Hi.
00:24:53.575,00:24:58.538,"Jessie's a good singer, but you and I both know he doesn't have much heart."
00:24:58.580,00:25:01.459,Vocal Adrenaline's best days are behind it.
00:25:01.499,00:25:03.669,So I have a proposition for you.
00:25:04.586,00:25:06.464,Come teach at McKinley.
00:25:10.592,00:25:12.761,We'd be unstoppable.
00:25:13.846,00:25:16.640,There's so much that you can teach me.
00:25:17.975,00:25:20.560,So much only you can teach me.
00:25:20.602,00:25:24.606,"Oh, Rachel, I can't do this anymore."
00:25:24.648,00:25:26.400,I'm tired of coaching glee club.
00:25:26.442,00:25:27.609,I want a life.
00:25:27.651,00:25:32.406,It took meeting you to realize all the stuff that I missed out on.
00:25:32.448,00:25:34.241,"I need some balance, you know?"
00:25:43.792,00:25:48.464,"I missed out on my chance with you, and it kills me."
00:26:00.642,00:26:03.020,Quinn had her baby.
00:26:04.646,00:26:06.273,"It was, um..."
00:26:06.315,00:26:09.026,It's a beautiful baby girl.
00:26:22.831,00:26:24.041,"Sue, if I may."
00:26:24.666,00:26:30.256,"That Bohemian Rhapsody had me a-movin' and a-shakin', and I'm talking old school."
00:26:30.297,00:26:36.011,"You know, I partied with Freddy Mercury back in the '70s, and I partied... hard, if you know what I mean."
00:26:36.053,00:26:39.265,"Back then, people weren't so obsessed with labels."
00:26:39.306,00:26:42.893,"I, for one, was offended that only one of the groups chose to honor me in song."
00:26:42.935,00:26:45.062,I think Aural Intensity should win.
00:26:45.104,00:26:46.646,Yes.
00:26:49.691,00:26:53.153,And two: How about those New Directions?
00:26:53.195,00:26:56.449,I liked them. I thought they had a lot of... heart.
00:26:56.490,00:26:58.576,"Heart? Oh, please."
00:26:58.616,00:27:00.660,Talk about blatant tokenism.
00:27:00.702,00:27:07.334,"That whole We're inspiring, we're a ragtag bunch of misfits thing is so 2009."
00:27:07.376,00:27:09.462,I couldn't agree more.
00:27:09.503,00:27:11.255,The production values simply weren't there.
00:27:11.297,00:27:13.299,Couldn't they afford better costumes?
00:27:13.340,00:27:15.134,Are they a poor person school?
00:27:15.175,00:27:17.386,GROBAN: I thought that brunette had an amazing voice.
00:27:22.099,00:27:25.603,"By the time I was 14, I'd already formed a band."
00:27:29.773,00:27:35.279,"As the only educator here, let me point out that not all kids are afforded the same opportunities as others."
00:27:35.321,00:27:37.573,Is that what you tell yourself to get to sleep at night?
00:27:37.615,00:27:42.077,Some people just simply don't have talent.
00:27:42.119,00:27:44.538,You think you're a celebrity.
00:27:47.749,00:27:50.002,Olivia Newton-John has a valid point here.
00:27:57.259,00:27:59.011,Dagnabbit!
00:27:59.052,00:28:03.723,"Now even I have to admit, I'm a little confused as to what Sue is doing in this room."
00:28:03.765,00:28:05.643,Wasn't the theme tonight supposed to be celebrity judges?
00:28:09.647,00:28:15.569,"When this is done today, Josh and I are flying back to L.A. first class."
00:28:15.611,00:28:17.530,You'll be staying here.
00:28:17.571,00:28:18.780,Just like those kids.
00:28:20.782,00:28:22.700,Let's vote.
00:28:49.811,00:28:53.566,"As you all know, glee club is such an important..."
00:28:53.607,00:28:55.484,And I honestly can't even finish that sentence.
00:28:55.526,00:28:57.069,So let's just get to it.
00:29:02.866,00:29:07.746,The 2010 Midwest Regional Runners-up...
00:29:08.830,00:29:14.378,"...from Fort Wayne, Indiana, the not-at-all stupidly-named Aural Intensity!"
00:29:28.141,00:29:30.018,SUE: Very good.
00:29:30.060,00:29:32.020,Mm-hmm.
00:29:51.039,00:29:52.832,...Vocal Adrenaline!
00:30:28.076,00:30:30.078,We didn't even place.
00:30:48.096,00:30:50.098,She looks like you.
00:30:51.642,00:30:53.893,Do you want to keep her?
00:30:53.935,00:30:55.895,No.
00:30:55.937,00:30:58.023,Do you?
00:31:00.192,00:31:03.862,Did you love me?
00:31:04.530,00:31:06.532,Yes.
00:31:06.573,00:31:08.659,Especially now.
00:31:20.587,00:31:22.840,Which one is yours?
00:31:24.550,00:31:26.510,What are you doing here?
00:31:26.552,00:31:29.388,I see her now.
00:31:30.764,00:31:32.891,She looks like you.
00:31:34.976,00:31:36.812,Does she have a name?
00:31:36.854,00:31:38.438,No.
00:31:38.480,00:31:39.523,Beth.
00:31:39.565,00:31:41.775,Pretty.
00:31:42.568,00:31:44.319,I like that name.
00:31:45.571,00:31:46.946,How do you even call yourself a principal?
00:31:46.988,00:31:48.615,"Okay, this is..."
00:31:56.623,00:31:58.584,Emma?
00:31:58.625,00:32:00.878,Emma?! What was that about?
00:32:00.919,00:32:03.255,"Will, your kids have worked so hard for this."
00:32:03.296,00:32:06.216,Did you know he's already given your choir room to the Mock UN?
00:32:06.258,00:32:08.886,A deal's a deal.
00:32:10.011,00:32:13.849,"She cheated, Will, and where do you think all that money's going?"
00:32:15.308,00:32:16.769,We can't let her win this one!
00:32:16.810,00:32:19.563,How can you just stand there and be so calm about this?
00:32:19.605,00:32:21.356,How can you just give up so easily?
00:32:24.025,00:32:25.026,It-It's over.
00:32:26.445,00:32:27.863,I don't care what anybody says.
00:32:27.905,00:32:29.573,Some things are worth fighting for.
00:32:30.866,00:32:32.701,Anything else?
00:32:35.036,00:32:37.038,The hell it is.
00:32:38.415,00:32:42.001,"There, I finally said it."
00:32:42.043,00:32:45.839,"And you love me, and dentist or no, this thing isn't over between us."
00:32:55.056,00:32:56.015,Yeah.
00:33:11.156,00:33:14.993,"In the beginning of this year, I was just another football player."
00:33:16.787,00:33:17.746,I had a stutter.
00:33:17.788,00:33:20.039,I was a closeted diva.
00:33:20.081,00:33:21.834,I used to be captain of the Cheerios.
00:33:21.875,00:33:23.836,I was afraid to dance outside my room.
00:33:23.877,00:33:25.963,I hated everyone in this club.
00:33:26.004,00:33:26.630,So did I.
00:33:26.672,00:33:29.048,I wasn't honest about who I was.
00:33:29.090,00:33:31.844,I was tossing kids into Dumpsters.
00:33:31.885,00:33:34.471,I had never kissed a girl before.
00:33:34.513,00:33:36.765,And I was getting slushied.
00:33:38.517,00:33:41.728,I didn't-I didn't have a father.
00:33:42.896,00:33:45.858,Someone I could look up to.
00:33:45.899,00:33:48.026,Model myself after.
00:33:55.617,00:33:59.329,We don't care what the judges say.
00:34:01.623,00:34:03.333,Because we had you as a teacher.
00:34:03.375,00:34:09.255,"MERCEDES: And Glee Club will never end, Mr. Shue, because..."
00:34:09.297,00:34:11.800,you are Glee Club.
00:34:13.510,00:34:15.971,And you're in all of us now.
00:37:05.891,00:37:08.101,"It's as barren as me in here, Will."
00:37:11.563,00:37:13.940,"Did you just come to gloat, Sue?"
00:37:13.982,00:37:14.566,Mostly.
00:37:14.607,00:37:17.485,Well... congratulations.
00:37:17.527,00:37:20.279,You got what you wanted.
00:37:20.321,00:37:21.656,I should shake your hand.
00:37:23.324,00:37:25.911,I've seen that car you drive; I don't want to catch poor.
00:37:25.952,00:37:27.996,Explain something to me.
00:37:28.038,00:37:31.083,Maybe we weren't good enough yet to beat Vocal Adrenaline-- fine.
00:37:31.124,00:37:33.710,But we were so much better than Aural Intensity.
00:37:33.752,00:37:36.295,"Oh, William, I can't reveal how the voting went down."
00:37:36.337,00:37:38.673,That would betray my sacred oath as judge or something.
00:37:38.715,00:37:42.010,The results simply show the other clubs to be more deserving.
00:37:42.052,00:37:45.680,All I can say is casting my vote was easy.
00:37:45.722,00:37:50.268,It reflected exactly how I felt in my heart about which team should win.
00:37:55.774,00:37:57.609,"Well, Sue, congratulations."
00:38:00.528,00:38:01.863,I lose.
00:38:04.532,00:38:07.326,The kids lose.
00:38:10.997,00:38:14.251,I spend large segments of each day picturing you choking on food.
00:38:14.292,00:38:24.343,"And I recently contacted an exotic animal dealer because I had a very satisfying dream that the two of us went to a zoo, and I shoved your face into one of those pink inflamed monkey butts that weeps lymph."
00:38:36.397,00:38:42.779,And I've proven that I can wipe you and your Glee Club off the face of this earth.
00:38:48.785,00:38:55.374,World where I couldn't make fun of you for tearing up more than Michael Landon in a sweeps week's episode of Little House on the Prairie.
00:38:57.418,00:39:02.174,Sue Sylvester's not sure she wants to live in that kind of world.
00:39:05.593,00:39:07.386,Glee Club gets another year.
00:39:07.428,00:39:08.805,I get what I want.
00:39:08.847,00:39:11.432,Do you really not understand how this sexual blackmail thing works?
00:39:13.101,00:39:15.770,I will not be blackmailed by you anymore!
00:39:15.812,00:39:20.317,I will tell my wife of our heated sexual congress before I will be bullied by you again!
00:39:23.444,00:39:28.283,"Give the glee club another year, and I won't mention us making the beast with two backs again."
00:39:28.325,00:39:29.659,Huh?
00:39:29.701,00:39:32.411,We have another year?
00:39:32.453,00:39:33.705,"You're a good teacher, Will."
00:39:33.746,00:39:35.290,"Now, I don't like you so much."
00:39:41.713,00:39:44.299,"Bon chance, William."
00:39:44.341,00:39:48.678,I relish the thought of another full year of constantly besting you.
00:39:53.892,00:39:55.727,you're a really good person.
00:39:58.563,00:40:00.606,Hey...
00:40:00.648,00:40:04.236,I appreciate what you're doing for these kids.
00:40:05.486,00:40:08.948,And I'm seriously going to puke in your mouth.
00:40:28.509,00:40:30.387,What?
00:40:30.428,00:40:33.139,"Come on, we got another year!"
00:40:38.519,00:40:40.313,Yeah!
00:40:40.355,00:40:41.940,Are you serious?!
00:40:43.524,00:40:44.650,Whoa!
00:40:47.946,00:40:54.077,"Okay, you guys, I think this is the perfect opportunity for us to start rehearsing for next year's Sectionals immediately..."
00:40:56.704,00:40:58.123,Take the summer off.
00:40:58.164,00:40:59.665,Have some fun.
00:40:59.707,00:41:03.128,"Oh, but before you go, I have something for you."
00:41:04.129,00:41:08.300,"You all sang for me the other day, so today I'd like to return the favor."
00:41:08.341,00:41:09.717,"Puck, if you're ready."
00:42:16.284,00:42:19.245,All the adoption papers seem to be in order.
00:42:19.287,00:42:22.957,But there's no name on the birth certificate yet.
00:42:22.999,00:42:24.583,It's Beth.
