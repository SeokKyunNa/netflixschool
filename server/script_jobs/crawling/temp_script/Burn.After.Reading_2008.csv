00:01:40.225,00:01:42.185,Palmer. What's up?
00:01:42.227,00:01:45.647,"Uh, you know, uh, Peck and Olson."
00:01:45.689,00:01:47.900,"Olson, by reputation."
00:01:49.818,00:01:53.447,-I'm Osborne Cox.
00:01:53.488,00:01:57.076,Aren't you with...
00:01:57.117,00:01:59.119,"Uh, have a seat."
00:02:00.203,00:02:02.163,"Look, Oz, look."
00:02:02.205,00:02:04.291,There's no easy way to say this.
00:02:05.292,00:02:08.545,We're taking you off the Balkans desk.
00:02:08.587,00:02:11.172,What? Why?
00:02:11.214,00:02:14.426,"In fact, we're moving you out of SigInt entirely."
00:02:14.468,00:02:18.305,Just... No discussion?
00:02:18.346,00:02:21.141,"Well, we're having the discussion now."
00:02:21.182,00:02:24.269,"Look, um, Oz."
00:02:24.311,00:02:34.195,"This doesn't have to be unpleasant. Uh-- Palmer, with all due respect, what the fuck are you talking about?"
00:02:34.237,00:02:36.865,And why is Olson here?
00:02:36.907,00:02:39.200,"Uh, Ozzie, look-- What the fuck is this?"
00:02:39.242,00:02:41.620,I know it's not my work.
00:02:41.662,00:02:44.205,I'm a great fucking analyst!
00:02:44.247,00:02:46.207,"Is... Is it my-- Ozzie, things..."
00:02:46.249,00:02:49.377,"Things have not been going well, as you know."
00:02:49.419,00:02:51.922,You have a drinking problem.
00:02:58.553,00:03:00.597,I have a drinking problem?
00:03:00.639,00:03:03.224,"Uh, this doesn't have to be unpleasant."
00:03:03.266,00:03:06.227,"Um, we found something for you in State."
00:03:06.269,00:03:09.564,"It's a, um, um..."
00:03:09.606,00:03:14.235,"Well, it is a lower clearance level, yes, but... but it's..."
00:03:14.277,00:03:17.405,"Look, we're not..."
00:03:17.447,00:03:21.242,Hmm.
00:03:21.284,00:03:23.244,I have a drinking problem?
00:03:23.286,00:03:26.247,"Fuck you, Peck."
00:03:23.286,00:03:30.418,"Ozzie-- Next to you, we all have a drinking problem!"
00:03:30.460,00:03:33.714,Whose ass didn't I kiss?
00:03:33.755,00:03:36.508,Huh?
00:03:33.755,00:03:41.304,"Okay, uh, Olson-- I mean, let us be fucking honest!"
00:03:41.346,00:03:43.264,This is political!
00:03:43.306,00:03:46.226,And don't tell me it's not!
00:03:47.310,00:03:49.396,I have a drinking problem!
00:04:01.700,00:04:05.204,"Oh, you're home."
00:04:05.245,00:04:07.664,"Honey, hang on to your hat."
00:04:07.706,00:04:10.291,Did you pick up the cheeses?
00:04:10.333,00:04:12.794,The cheeses...
00:04:12.836,00:04:15.255,I didn't realize that you'd be home so early.
00:04:15.296,00:04:17.841,"Yeah, I left a message for you to stop by Arno's."
00:04:17.883,00:04:20.301,The Magruders and the Pfarrers are coming this evening.
00:04:20.343,00:04:23.722,The Pfarrers. Ugh.
00:04:23.764,00:04:26.683,What?
00:04:26.725,00:04:28.936,That she would give you the message.
00:04:28.977,00:04:31.312,"Well, I don't know."
00:04:31.354,00:04:35.483,My day didn't revolve around whether or not-- Do you mean you didn't pick up the cheeses?
00:04:35.525,00:04:38.403,"Well, if I didn't get the message, then I didn't pick up the cheeses."
00:04:38.445,00:04:41.240,For fuck's sake!
00:04:41.281,00:04:43.450,I have some news to-- Stay here and get dressed.
00:04:43.491,00:04:45.619,"Honey, we have to talk."
00:04:45.660,00:04:48.914,"I mean, they're going to be here in less than an hour!"
00:04:50.249,00:04:52.333,Is that goat cheese?
00:04:52.375,00:04:55.295,"Chèvre, yes."
00:04:55.336,00:05:00.341,"Because I have a lactose reflux, and I can't-- You're lactose intolerant?"
00:04:58.215,00:05:03.344,"Yeah, but I can-- Or you have acid reflux?"
00:05:03.386,00:05:05.346,I know what they are.
00:05:05.388,00:05:07.266,"Well, thank you for correcting me."
00:05:07.307,00:05:09.559,"You should try the chèvre, Harry."
00:05:09.601,00:05:11.561,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:11.603,00:05:13.939,I was just telling your husband that I have a condition...
00:05:13.981,00:05:19.278,"where I go into anaphylactic shock when I-- Harry works in the Marshal Service, Doug."
00:05:19.319,00:05:22.072,I'm on the legislative side.
00:05:22.114,00:05:24.825,Oh. I was with Treasury until they went to Homeland Security.
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.910,I'm with the Marshals now.
00:05:26.952,00:05:29.663,"If you want, he'll show you his great big gun."
00:05:29.704,00:05:31.665,That's very funny.
00:05:31.706,00:05:35.376,The gun's no big deal.
00:05:35.418,00:05:38.672,That sounds like something you should be telling your psychiatrist.
00:05:38.713,00:05:41.382,I don't have a psychiatrist.
00:05:41.424,00:05:44.928,"Boy, I guess my job is pretty undramatic."
00:05:44.970,00:05:47.388,I'm on the legislative side.
00:05:47.430,00:05:50.349,"Mrs. Pfarrer, what do you do?"
00:05:50.391,00:05:54.146,"No, I write children's-- She writes children's books."
00:05:54.188,00:05:57.482,"You know, Oliver the Cat That Lives in the Rotunda."
00:05:57.524,00:06:01.360,"Well, those are wonderful!"
00:06:01.402,00:06:03.404,Thank you.
00:06:03.446,00:06:05.406,You should see the fan mail she gets.
00:06:05.448,00:06:07.450,You sure this is goat cheese?
00:06:07.492,00:06:09.828,"Let your wife tell them about her own books, Harry."
00:06:09.870,00:06:13.165,Come with me to the kitchen and help with the crudités.
00:06:16.459,00:06:19.504,Goddamn it.
00:06:19.546,00:06:21.506,He knows what?
00:06:21.548,00:06:24.425,"He knows about us, the little prick."
00:06:24.467,00:06:26.511,He doesn't know a thing.
00:06:27.804,00:06:30.389,"What is that, Forbo?"
00:06:36.437,00:06:40.317,What a horse's ass.
00:06:40.359,00:06:42.861,"Well, she's all right."
00:06:42.903,00:06:45.989,"She's a cold, stuck-up bitch."
00:06:51.870,00:06:54.455,- You quit?
00:06:54.497,00:06:56.457,"Well, thank you for telling me."
00:06:56.499,00:06:59.211,"Look, I tried to tell you this afternoon-- Tried? You tried?"
00:06:59.253,00:07:01.462,And then what?
00:07:01.504,00:07:05.092,"Then our guests came, and then-- Why? For fuck's sake, Ozzie!"
00:07:05.133,00:07:07.844,I don't know.
00:07:07.886,00:07:11.472,You're tired?
00:07:11.514,00:07:14.017,Uh-huh.
00:07:14.059,00:07:16.477,Independent thought is not valued there.
00:07:16.519,00:07:19.856,They resist it.
00:07:16.519,00:07:23.110,"The bureaucracy is-- So they gave you a pension, a severance or something?"
00:07:23.151,00:07:26.780,I didn't retire.
00:07:26.821,00:07:29.449,But my benefits...
00:07:29.490,00:07:31.993,They'll see you through.
00:07:32.035,00:07:34.621,It's not like that's the only way to make money.
00:07:34.662,00:07:36.998,Yes? Yes?
00:07:37.040,00:07:39.584,I'll do some consulting.
00:07:39.626,00:07:41.586,Consulting?
00:07:41.628,00:07:45.924,Yes.
00:07:45.966,00:07:48.509,I've always wanted to write.
00:07:48.551,00:07:51.805,Write? Write what?
00:07:53.140,00:07:57.477,"I've been thinking about writing a, um... a book..."
00:07:57.518,00:08:02.399,"or, you know, a sort of memoir."
00:08:14.411,00:08:16.496,"You okay there, Dad?"
00:08:27.257,00:08:29.843,"Dad, I left my job at the Agency."
00:08:33.930,00:08:36.016,"I'm sorry, Dad."
00:08:39.602,00:08:45.692,Government service is not... the same as when you were in State.
00:08:45.733,00:08:48.403,Things are different now.
00:08:48.445,00:08:52.991,I don't know. Maybe it's...
00:08:54.993,00:08:59.914,Now it seems like it's all bureaucracy and no mission.
00:09:01.833,00:09:05.586,I'm writing a memoir.
00:09:05.628,00:09:09.883,I think it can be pretty explosive.
00:09:09.924,00:09:12.593,But I don't think you would disapprove.
00:09:12.635,00:09:14.971,I don't think you would disapprove.
00:09:15.013,00:09:20.601,"Katie's had trouble accepting it, but sometimes there's a higher patriotism, Dad."
00:09:34.657,00:09:36.951,It's much the same thing.
00:09:36.993,00:09:40.621,I know this kind of man.
00:09:40.663,00:09:44.834,"Mrs. Cox, you cannot let this man take advantage of you."
00:09:44.876,00:09:47.087,And he will. He will.
00:09:47.128,00:09:49.089,Yes. This is my fear.
00:09:49.130,00:09:52.884,Though he's trying...
00:09:49.130,00:09:58.639,"Well, he says he's trying to pull himself together, but-- Yeah. Look, sure, I'm obliged to tell you to try to salvage things."
00:09:58.681,00:10:00.641,And you should.
00:10:00.683,00:10:04.645,It's not unheard of that people turn themselves around.
00:10:04.687,00:10:09.609,"But, uh, you, uh you haven't broached the possibility of divorce yet?"
00:10:09.650,00:10:11.736,-No.
00:10:09.650,00:10:16.074,"-Well, that's good, because first you should get his financials before he's forewarned."
00:10:16.116,00:10:18.201,Because here's a man...
00:10:18.243,00:10:21.288,Here's a man practiced in deceit.
00:10:21.329,00:10:23.706,This is almost...
00:10:23.748,00:10:27.043,And there is no reason...
00:10:27.085,00:10:31.881,There is no reason you shouldn't get a picture of the household finances.
00:10:31.923,00:10:35.594,"Paper files, computer files, whatever."
00:10:35.635,00:10:37.762,That's your prerogative.
00:10:37.804,00:10:41.808,"You can be a spy too, madam."
00:10:41.849,00:10:48.189,"Do this before he's put on alert, before the turtle can draw in his head and his, uh..."
00:10:48.231,00:10:50.191,uh...
00:10:50.233,00:10:52.486,-Feet.
00:10:52.527,00:10:56.697,And hopefully everything will work out.
00:10:56.739,00:11:02.954,"But if not, forewarned is forearmed."
00:11:10.462,00:11:15.674,"We were young and committed, and there was nothing we could not do."
00:11:17.051,00:11:21.680,We thought of the agency less... le...
00:11:23.682,00:11:26.561,Um... Hmm.
00:11:26.603,00:11:32.859,"The principles of George Kennan, a personal hero of mine."
00:11:34.486,00:11:38.906,Like the fabled Murrow's Boys...
00:11:40.367,00:11:42.952,at a time...
00:11:42.994,00:11:57.758,of-- You have reached the Cox Group.
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.761,We can't answer your call right-- Hello.
00:12:02.389,00:12:05.308,"Uh, no, uh, she..."
00:12:05.350,00:12:07.935,Hers is the 5719 number.
00:12:07.977,00:12:14.150,"This is the Cox Group, but you can reach her on her portable or at her office."
00:12:14.192,00:12:16.695,She's married!
00:12:16.735,00:12:18.946,"Ah, number four."
00:12:18.988,00:12:21.157,Has boyfriend!
00:12:21.199,00:12:23.243,And number six.
00:12:23.284,00:12:25.953,She's pregnant!
00:12:59.862,00:13:01.864,Y-Yes.
00:13:08.663,00:13:10.831,I should try to get a run in.
00:13:13.167,00:13:15.169,Ozzie?
00:13:20.883,00:13:22.801,Ozzie!
00:14:57.731,00:14:59.607,Hurrah!
00:15:01.984,00:15:04.945,We take all the chicken fat off your buttocks...
00:15:04.987,00:15:08.783,Here.
00:15:09.784,00:15:11.952,And the upper arms.
00:15:11.994,00:15:15.540,Mm-hmm.
00:15:15.582,00:15:19.960,"Yeah, great."
00:15:20.002,00:15:25.258,with a tiny incision here-- Ow. That marker tickles.
00:15:25.299,00:15:28.428,"And what about the upper leg, the higher inside thigh area?"
00:15:28.469,00:15:32.932,"Well, we can do liposuction there as well, but that area will respond to exercise."
00:15:32.973,00:15:36.102,Well.
00:15:32.973,00:15:38.187,The buttocks and upper arms begin to store more fat once you get up around 40.
00:15:38.229,00:15:40.732,The body just tells it to go there.
00:15:40.774,00:15:43.568,But the thighs will respond to toning exercises.
00:15:43.610,00:15:49.323,"Yeah, I could work on my arms till the cows come home, but-- Uh-huh. Well, also, there are, of course, genetic factors."
00:15:49.365,00:15:51.367,The Litzkes have always been big.
00:15:51.409,00:15:54.454,Everyone's got a family history.
00:15:54.495,00:15:57.206,"Wow. Well, that's a predisposition."
00:15:57.248,00:16:00.835,"Although Dad tended to carry his weight out in front more, in the gut area."
00:16:00.877,00:16:02.837,"Derriere, not so much."
00:16:02.879,00:16:06.257,And what about the face?
00:16:06.299,00:16:09.218,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
00:16:09.260,00:16:18.770,"Well, your eyes are one of your best features, but we can do something about the incipient crow's-feet."
00:16:18.812,00:16:20.855,Baby crow's-feet!
00:16:20.897,00:16:23.566,"I mean, chicks."
00:16:23.608,00:16:26.945,"Yes, again, well put."
00:16:26.986,00:16:32.700,"We make a small incision and then pull the skin tight, like stretching the skin over a drum."
00:16:32.742,00:16:35.620,Not too tight though.
00:16:35.662,00:16:38.080,You need sufficient slack for the face to remain expressive.
00:16:38.122,00:16:40.124,"Yeah, I don't want to look like Boris Karloff."
00:16:40.166,00:16:43.043,So you don't want a sex change.
00:16:43.085,00:16:44.838,I am all woman!
00:16:44.879,00:16:50.343,"So, Linda, what we're talking about here is four different procedures."
00:16:50.384,00:16:57.057,"The liposuction, the rhinoplasty, the facial tuck, which I would strongly recommend over the chemical peel."
00:16:57.099,00:16:59.268,"Yeah, I don't want to burn anything off."
00:16:59.310,00:17:01.479,"And why should you, with that lovely skin?"
00:17:01.521,00:17:03.898,"And lastly, the breast augmentation."
00:17:03.940,00:17:09.111,"Now, we can also do something about the vaccine scar."
00:17:09.153,00:17:13.574,I don't know if you wear sleeveless dresses much-- Not with these ham hocks.
00:17:13.616,00:17:20.122,"Yes, well, once they're nice and svelte, post-op, you, uh... you may change your mind about that."
00:17:20.164,00:17:23.376,I want to talk about this vaccine thing.
00:17:23.417,00:17:27.213,"I mean, is it really that unsightly? I mean, a bunch of people have them."
00:17:27.254,00:17:30.257,Absolutely.
00:17:30.299,00:17:32.259,It's personal taste.
00:17:36.890,00:17:39.141,Chad.
00:17:39.183,00:17:42.603,Exhale.
00:17:42.645,00:17:45.147,Hold it.
00:17:45.189,00:17:47.191,Hold and release.
00:17:47.233,00:17:50.277,And release.
00:17:50.319,00:17:52.655,-Too much?
00:17:52.697,00:17:55.867,"I-I just felt a straining, a tightness in the front of my ass."
00:17:55.909,00:18:00.120,"-Well, you are pretty tight down there. You have to-- -Something snapped in my ass!"
00:18:00.162,00:18:02.415,"Chad Feldheimer to the office, please."
00:18:02.456,00:18:04.751,I'm gonna check in with my office.
00:18:04.792,00:18:06.836,Then we're gonna work on opening those hips.
00:18:10.798,00:18:13.342,I just got a batch from BeWithMeDC.com.
00:18:13.384,00:18:15.469,"Oh, no!"
00:18:15.511,00:18:18.138,I don't know.
00:18:18.180,00:18:20.140,Click on the...
00:18:20.182,00:18:23.227,"Oh, my God. Okay."
00:18:23.269,00:18:26.689,Loser. Loser!
00:18:26.731,00:18:29.650,They should call this MisterLoser.com.
00:18:29.692,00:18:32.152,Did you have to send in a picture?
00:18:32.194,00:18:35.155,"I had to fill out a verbal profile... what turns me on, what turns me off."
00:18:35.197,00:18:37.658,I'm really looking for a guy with a sense of humor.
00:18:37.700,00:18:40.369,-That guy... Wait.
00:18:40.411,00:18:42.830,"No, before."
00:18:42.872,00:18:45.458,Yeah. Oh.
00:18:45.499,00:18:47.543,That's a Brioni suit.
00:18:47.585,00:18:50.880,"Shit, yeah!"
00:18:50.922,00:18:53.507,Looks like his optometrist has a sense of humor.
00:18:53.549,00:18:55.551,What does he do?
00:18:55.593,00:18:57.553,"Uh, State Department."
00:18:57.595,00:19:00.098,"Ah, that's cool."
00:19:00.139,00:19:02.600,His hair is...
00:19:05.019,00:19:07.146,Plugs?
00:19:09.440,00:19:13.694,"This is our cardio area, and we have a lot of machines, so believe me, there is never a wait."
00:19:13.736,00:19:17.197,"What you see now is, like, our busiest time, and there's, like, a lot of machines open."
00:19:17.239,00:19:20.159,"Hey, Chad."
00:19:20.200,00:19:23.037,"No, not yet."
00:19:23.079,00:19:26.540,"I've been doing this Internet dating thing, and-- What service?"
00:19:26.582,00:19:29.043,"Uh, BeWithMeDC.com."
00:19:29.085,00:19:33.422,Have you used them?
00:19:33.464,00:19:37.426,With really special guys.
00:19:37.468,00:19:40.387,"If you're an English speaker, please say yes or English."
00:19:40.429,00:19:42.640,Yes.
00:19:42.682,00:19:44.642,If you're an English speaker-- English.
00:19:44.684,00:19:47.227,Would you like to speak to the billing department or to an agent?
00:19:47.269,00:19:49.689,Agent.
00:19:49.730,00:19:51.691,Agent! Agent!
00:19:53.860,00:19:55.820,Hello. Can I help you?
00:19:55.862,00:19:58.823,This is Linda Litzke.
00:19:58.865,00:20:01.283,You keyed it in.
00:20:01.325,00:20:06.998,"I was told that I needed pre-approval for these surgeries-- Yes, I'm showing that this procedure was not approved."
00:20:07.040,00:20:09.000,"Yes, it was denied."
00:20:09.042,00:20:11.752,This operation is an elective procedure.
00:20:09.042,00:20:15.048,"It's not covered by-- No, these are four different operations."
00:20:15.089,00:20:18.592,I'm reinventing myself.
00:20:18.634,00:20:20.594,But they are all approved by my doctor.
00:20:20.636,00:20:23.263,"Your doctor's approval is not the issue, ma'am."
00:20:20.636,00:20:25.892,B-But this is not-- Our guidelines specify that elective surgeries are not-- Madam.
00:20:25.933,00:20:28.435,My job involves public interface.
00:20:25.933,00:20:31.105,This is not-- I'm afraid you don't understand. The guidelines are very clear.
00:20:31.147,00:20:34.525,"Oh, I understand!"
00:20:34.567,00:20:36.652,Hold the line.
00:21:22.364,00:21:25.868,-Alan?
00:21:25.910,00:21:27.954,Yeah.
00:21:27.995,00:21:31.373,I asked you at Aunt Shirley's.
00:21:31.415,00:21:35.836,I asked you at the bank.
00:21:35.878,00:21:38.589,"First you say you can't commit, and then..."
00:21:38.631,00:21:40.883,Would you come down from there?
00:23:25.196,00:23:28.908,We were married when I was in my mid-20s.
00:23:28.949,00:23:32.828,A kid. We were kids.
00:23:32.870,00:23:35.413,"You, uh..."
00:23:36.916,00:23:45.007,"You get older, and you start to feel your mortality, and you say there's no more time for dishonesty, for subterfuge."
00:23:45.049,00:23:47.467,"You say, I'm not that person."
00:23:45.049,00:23:50.346,The choices you've made-- I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
00:23:55.601,00:23:58.436,"Frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. Uh..."
00:24:01.190,00:24:05.485,"I guess that's what I should be thinking, too, uh, with Sandy."
00:24:05.527,00:24:08.572,"Well, that's what you were just saying."
00:24:08.614,00:24:11.617,Absolutely. Yes.
00:24:11.658,00:24:14.370,You should dump that bozo.
00:24:15.579,00:24:18.082,"So, if I were divorced-- Yes?"
00:24:18.124,00:24:22.002,"I should settle things, uh, with Sandy."
00:24:22.044,00:24:24.004,Because of you and me.
00:24:24.046,00:24:26.590,Hmm.
00:24:26.632,00:24:29.427,"It's, you know..."
00:24:30.552,00:24:33.973,"It's just hard to inflict that kind of pain, you know?"
00:24:34.014,00:24:36.474,"Of course, that would be easier for you."
00:24:38.394,00:24:41.563,Why is that?
00:24:41.605,00:24:45.483,"Well, 'cause he's such a dope, and Sandy's a good lady."
00:24:45.525,00:24:47.987,She's a very special lady.
00:24:48.028,00:24:51.657,"She's a cold, stuck-up bitch."
00:24:48.028,00:24:53.742,Hmm. That's a little-- You and I should get things sorted.
00:24:53.784,00:24:56.245,I've always told you it's more than just frivolity.
00:24:56.287,00:24:58.789,That's right.
00:24:58.831,00:25:03.252,I think I've been loud and clear.
00:25:04.586,00:25:06.922,Not just fun and games.
00:25:10.217,00:25:12.761,Absolutely.
00:25:31.613,00:25:34.616,Agent!
00:25:34.658,00:25:37.286,Agent!
00:25:39.788,00:25:41.790,Your call is important to us.
00:25:41.832,00:25:44.710,Please stay on the line for the next available agent.
00:25:55.137,00:25:57.681,"Ted, can I talk to you about our Mickey Mouse H.M.O.?"
00:25:57.723,00:26:00.351,Uh-huh. Hang on.
00:26:00.393,00:26:02.436,Is that my date list?
00:26:02.478,00:26:06.899,"You know, I'm trying to reinvent myself, and these procedures, which are so incredibly not cheap..."
00:26:06.940,00:26:08.901,What is that?
00:26:08.942,00:26:10.903,"This is, like, intelligence shit."
00:26:10.944,00:26:12.988,I'm not comfortable with this.
00:26:13.030,00:26:15.615,"This is, like... I can't believe the shit I'm seeing."
00:26:15.657,00:26:19.328,-On the floor there.
00:26:19.370,00:26:21.330,Locker floor.
00:26:21.372,00:26:23.416,"I'm, like, what, someone's music or what?"
00:26:23.457,00:26:26.626,"-And I come in here, and it's these files, man."
00:26:26.668,00:26:30.005,Talkin' about SigInt and signals and shit...
00:26:30.047,00:26:33.342,-And... Signals means code.
00:26:33.384,00:26:36.429,Talking here about department heads and their names and shit.
00:26:36.470,00:26:39.639,"And then there's these other files that are just, like, numbers."
00:26:39.681,00:26:44.019,Arrayed.
00:26:44.061,00:26:46.772,And dates.
00:26:48.774,00:26:50.859,"I think that's the shit, man."
00:26:53.404,00:26:55.613,The raw intelligence.
00:26:55.655,00:26:58.158,I'm not touching this.
00:26:58.200,00:27:00.369,Throw it out?
00:27:00.411,00:27:03.372,You should put up a note in the ladies' locker room.
00:27:03.414,00:27:06.166,Highly classified shit found?
00:27:06.208,00:27:09.086,Signals intelligence shit?
00:27:09.128,00:27:12.298,Hello! Anybody lose their secret C.I.A. shit?
00:27:12.339,00:27:14.300,I don't know.
00:27:14.341,00:27:17.470,"But I'm not comfortable with this, and I want this out of Hardbodies."
00:27:17.511,00:27:20.847,We're running a gym here. God.
00:27:21.848,00:27:24.059,Manolo.
00:27:24.101,00:27:26.812,I find on the floor there.
00:27:26.853,00:27:29.523,"Yeah, I know, but-- Right there, on the floor there."
00:27:29.565,00:27:31.733,Just lying there.
00:27:58.469,00:28:00.804,Harry?
00:28:21.575,00:28:24.702,Pay for the whole thing.
00:28:24.744,00:28:28.624,"But if I could get an advance on my salary, I could at least get the surgery ball rolling."
00:28:28.666,00:28:30.750,"Whoa, whoa."
00:28:30.792,00:28:34.547,They don't just advance people money.
00:28:34.588,00:28:39.092,"I mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I authorize it, but it's not gonna mean anything to them."
00:28:39.134,00:28:41.679,Then why do they have us on this cockamamie health plan?
00:28:41.720,00:28:44.264,"I need those surgeries, Ted!"
00:28:41.720,00:28:47.142,You don't need-- I have gone just about as far as I can go with this body.
00:28:47.184,00:28:49.186,I think it's a beautiful...
00:28:49.228,00:28:51.771,It's not a phony-baloney Hollywood body.
00:28:51.813,00:28:54.774,"That's right, Ted."
00:28:54.816,00:29:02.366,"I have very limited breasts, a ginormous ass, and I've got this gut that swings back and forth in front of me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel."
00:29:02.408,00:29:05.494,"You know, there's a lot of guys that like you just the way you are."
00:29:05.536,00:29:07.621,Yeah. Losers.
00:29:08.788,00:29:10.874,I don't know.
00:29:08.788,00:29:14.294,"Oh, Ted-- You know, I wasn't always a manager at Hardbodies."
00:29:17.964,00:29:20.676,Let me show you something.
00:29:26.181,00:29:28.016,Is that you?
00:29:28.058,00:29:31.270,"Fourteen years, Greek Orthodox priest."
00:29:31.311,00:29:33.564,Congregation in Chevy Chase.
00:29:33.606,00:29:36.191,That's a good job.
00:29:37.859,00:29:39.903,It's a long story.
00:29:41.988,00:29:47.827,"Anyway, in many ways, I'm a lot happier now."
00:29:47.869,00:29:49.829,My point is...
00:29:49.871,00:29:51.831,"My point is, it's a journey."
00:29:51.873,00:29:53.959,That's my point.
00:29:54.000,00:29:55.835,I want to find someone to share my journey.
00:29:55.877,00:30:03.009,"Well, you know, sometimes if you don't look in your own backyard, you never-- -I know. That's why I started this Internet dating."
00:30:03.051,00:30:06.346,"But what I'm saying is, maybe you don't have to-- Okay, look, Ted."
00:30:06.388,00:30:12.227,"I know that you can't authorize an advance on my salary, but you could put in a request, can't you?"
00:30:12.269,00:30:14.313,"It's not gonna do any good, Linda."
00:30:14.354,00:30:18.400,"Oh, Ted. Have you ever heard of the power of positive thinking?"
00:30:27.909,00:30:30.036,"Uh, Harry?"
00:30:31.121,00:30:33.123,It's Monica.
00:30:33.165,00:30:35.875,"Well, hello."
00:30:43.842,00:30:46.345,Maybe I can get a run in.
00:30:54.936,00:30:58.898,Hello?
00:31:01.943,00:31:04.321,"-Oh, my God!"
00:31:05.905,00:31:07.866,"Oh, my God."
00:31:07.907,00:31:09.909,"Oh, my God."
00:31:09.951,00:31:11.953,Do you know what time it is?
00:31:11.995,00:31:16.875,"So I couldn't call you on your totally unsecure phone, but I know who the guy is."
00:31:17.959,00:31:19.961,The guy?
00:31:20.003,00:31:23.507,The guy.
00:31:23.549,00:31:26.343,"-So, is he high up?"
00:31:26.385,00:31:29.095,Probably.
00:31:29.137,00:31:31.598,So what's his name?
00:31:31.640,00:31:33.684,Osborne Cox.
00:31:33.726,00:31:35.644,Never heard of him.
00:31:35.686,00:31:38.647,"Oh, well, like you're so plugged in to the intelligence community."
00:31:38.689,00:31:44.194,"I'm just saying, as a layperson-- Well, I think the quality of the intelligence dictates how high up he is..."
00:31:44.236,00:31:46.196,Okay.
00:31:46.238,00:31:49.867,I also...
00:31:49.908,00:31:52.160,-I got tap water.
00:31:52.202,00:31:55.080,How do you know who he is?
00:31:55.121,00:31:57.165,"What do you mean, sources?"
00:31:57.207,00:32:00.001,"You got, like, Gatorade or anything besides, like, Maryland swamp water?"
00:32:00.043,00:32:03.380,-Do you know how far this is from my place?
00:32:03.422,00:32:06.550,"I got this geek friend, Eddie Gallagos."
00:32:06.592,00:32:09.928,Hooks up people's computers and programs their VCRs and shit.
00:32:09.969,00:32:15.267,"So he examines the files and pulls off the digital watermark, which tells you what computer it was created on."
00:32:15.308,00:32:17.561,Fuckin' child's play for Eddie.
00:32:17.603,00:32:21.398,And... I've got his number.
00:32:21.440,00:32:23.983,-I got his number.
00:32:24.025,00:32:27.279,That was a bit more difficult.
00:32:27.320,00:32:30.115,"Oh, my God. Why?"
00:32:30.156,00:32:34.870,'Cause he's gonna wanna know that his shit is secure.
00:32:34.912,00:32:37.205,He... He... He's gonna be relieved.
00:32:37.247,00:32:40.959,He might even be so relieved that he gives us a reward.
00:32:41.000,00:32:43.879,I would be very fucking surprised if he did not.
00:32:43.921,00:32:47.299,Very surprised.
00:32:47.340,00:32:50.803,"Which is not even a tax, really, since it's voluntary."
00:33:07.527,00:33:09.488,Hello?
00:33:09.529,00:33:13.951,"Uh, Osborne?"
00:33:13.992,00:33:15.953,Yes.
00:33:15.994,00:33:18.413,"Uh, who is this?"
00:33:18.455,00:33:22.417,"Um, is this, um..."
00:33:22.459,00:33:24.962,Is this Osborne Cox?
00:33:25.003,00:33:28.089,Who is this?
00:33:28.131,00:33:32.385,"Um, I'm a Good Samaritan."
00:33:32.427,00:33:38.851,"I'm sorry I'm calling at such an hour, but I thought you might be worried."
00:33:38.892,00:33:40.853,Worried?
00:33:40.894,00:33:45.524,About the security...
00:33:50.111,00:33:54.073,What on earth are you talking about?
00:33:54.115,00:33:56.075,Who am I speaking to?
00:33:56.117,00:33:58.036,"Uh, I... Your files."
00:33:58.077,00:34:00.497,"Your, uh... The documents."
00:34:00.539,00:34:11.341,"I know these documents are sensitive, but I am perfectly willing to give back to you your sensitive shit."
00:34:11.383,00:34:14.260,"You know, at a time of your choosing."
00:34:14.302,00:34:17.180,What documents are you talking about?
00:34:18.682,00:34:21.977,-Osborne Cox?
00:34:22.019,00:34:24.980,Hello! It's Osborne Cox!
00:34:25.022,00:34:27.607,What documents are you talking about?
00:34:27.649,00:34:29.943,Who is that?
00:34:31.570,00:34:35.114,The bureau chief in Belgrade we all called Slovak the Butcher.
00:34:35.156,00:34:41.872,"He had very little ‘report' with his staff, and his dispatches-- Rapport."
00:34:38.284,00:34:44.165,"Very little rapport with his staff, fucking moron."
00:34:44.207,00:34:47.836,- How did you get this?
00:34:47.878,00:34:51.048,"Listen, you are in way over your fucking head!"
00:34:47.878,00:34:56.636,"Uh, we have-- It's not important where-- I don't know who the fuck you are, but you have no idea what you're doing!"
00:34:56.678,00:35:00.473,"Oh? Wh-Why so uptight, Osborne Cox?"
00:35:00.515,00:35:02.601,I'm just...
00:35:02.642,00:35:04.770,A what? You're a what?
00:35:04.811,00:35:07.940,Tell him that we're gonna give it back. We just thought he would like to maybe know.
00:35:07.981,00:35:10.650,And tell him about that Good Samaritan Tax thing!
00:35:10.692,00:35:12.945,You tell him he's inconveniencing us!
00:35:12.986,00:35:16.155,Hello!
00:35:16.197,00:35:25.874,"You know, this is a major inconvenience for us, and we just thought a reward-- Ah! So it's money."
00:35:25.916,00:35:28.627,You want money?
00:35:28.668,00:35:31.713,-Am I out of line here?
00:35:31.755,00:35:36.802,"Listen to me, you two clowns."
00:35:36.843,00:35:38.887,You have no idea what you're doing.
00:35:38.929,00:35:42.099,- And I warn you-- -You warn us?
00:35:42.140,00:35:44.183,Yes. Yes. Yes.
00:35:44.225,00:35:47.020,"-Let me tell you something, Mr. Intelligence."
00:35:44.225,00:35:50.065,- Let me-- We warn you!
00:35:50.107,00:35:51.900,Hello? Listen.
00:35:51.942,00:35:54.611,"Don't you... No, Chad!"
00:35:51.942,00:35:56.571,We just want-- Let me explain how this will work!
00:35:58.406,00:36:00.867,Geez!
00:36:04.245,00:36:08.166,I am very fucking surprised he did not give us that reward.
00:36:08.416,00:36:11.003,What on earth is going on?
00:36:11.044,00:36:15.507,"Some clown, or two clowns, have gotten ahold of my memoirs."
00:36:15.548,00:36:18.217,Your what?
00:36:18.259,00:36:20.512,Stolen it or...
00:36:20.553,00:36:23.515,My memoirs. The book that I'm writing.
00:36:23.556,00:36:27.226,"Well, why in God's name would anyone think that's worth anything?"
00:36:32.149,00:36:34.233,Doesn't sound like he's gonna play ball.
00:36:34.275,00:36:35.902,"Oh, he'll play ball."
00:36:35.944,00:36:39.364,We just have to show him who's boss.
00:36:39.405,00:36:41.741,He sounds very senior.
00:36:41.783,00:36:45.411,I think this is some senior guy who's screwed the pooch big time.
00:36:45.453,00:36:47.497,"Yeah. That's why we got him, you know?"
00:36:47.539,00:36:50.249,We caught him with his thing caught in a big fat wringer.
00:36:50.291,00:36:53.252,-And us in the driver's seat.
00:36:53.294,00:36:55.714,This is our opportunity.
00:36:55.755,00:37:00.259,"You slip on the ice outside a fancy restaurant, or something like this happens."
00:37:00.301,00:37:04.014,-Right.
00:37:04.056,00:37:07.100,Yup. It sure has.
00:37:10.228,00:37:12.689,This could put a big dent in my surgeries.
00:37:13.857,00:37:17.194,Ah. Big time.
00:37:19.487,00:37:22.240,Honey? Honey!
00:37:23.324,00:37:27.579,-Huh?
00:37:27.620,00:37:29.873,What is that thing?
00:37:29.915,00:37:32.291,"Ah, it's top secret, baby."
00:37:32.333,00:37:36.337,How many cities?
00:37:36.379,00:37:39.382,Why do they always send you to Seattle?
00:37:39.424,00:37:42.135,I don't know. Lots of independent bookstores.
00:37:42.177,00:37:44.971,What else are people gonna do?
00:37:45.013,00:37:47.473,You can think of one thing.
00:37:47.515,00:37:51.770,"Christ, it better be the Peninsula."
00:37:51.811,00:37:54.731,You gonna be okay?
00:37:54.773,00:37:57.192,Not too sad.
00:37:59.903,00:38:02.989,"I'm crazy about you, baby."
00:38:22.383,00:38:25.804,-Hey!
00:38:37.857,00:38:42.654,"Tony Bennett, Toni Morrison, Zoe Caldwell."
00:38:42.695,00:38:44.656,It was marvelous.
00:38:44.697,00:38:47.826,First time I've ever attended the Kennedy Honors.
00:38:47.867,00:38:51.871,Jane Alexander is a client.
00:38:51.913,00:38:54.124,Anyway...
00:38:54.166,00:38:56.375,Connie?
00:38:56.417,00:39:01.506,"Yes, sir."
00:39:03.466,00:39:07.428,Tony sang The Best is Yet to Come.
00:39:07.470,00:39:09.555,Tony Bennett.
00:39:12.976,00:39:16.395,I thought I had it here on a disk. I don't know where the disk is.
00:39:16.437,00:39:19.024,I'm sorry. I'll have to run another off my hard drive.
00:39:19.065,00:39:21.067,"All right, okay."
00:39:21.109,00:39:28.783,"So, we've drawn up the papers, and we are prepared to execute service on Osborne, if you so elect, Mrs. Cox."
00:39:28.825,00:39:41.587,"But since we are at the point of no return, I always urge my clients at this juncture to give it one more day of reflection."
00:40:10.867,00:40:13.411,Harry?
00:40:13.452,00:40:16.455,It's Linda.
00:40:16.497,00:40:18.457,"Well, hello."
00:40:18.499,00:40:22.254,"No, I did the whole bodyguard thing for years, but..."
00:40:22.295,00:40:24.714,My guy was in State...
00:40:24.756,00:40:27.384,So I did a lot of traveling.
00:40:27.425,00:40:29.468,Ironside has left the building.
00:40:29.510,00:40:32.889,We called him Iron Ass.
00:40:32.931,00:40:36.475,"Ah, he's okay."
00:40:36.517,00:40:39.562,-These are really good.
00:40:39.604,00:40:41.606,-Does it have shell food in it?
00:40:41.647,00:40:44.984,"Well, I got a sensitivity."
00:40:45.026,00:40:47.070,My larynx swells up and it closes.
00:40:47.112,00:40:49.364,"Oh, what the hell."
00:40:49.406,00:40:51.699,"Can't always wear a condom, right?"
00:40:51.741,00:40:53.659,That's right! Not always.
00:40:56.537,00:40:58.206,Yeah. My job now's mostly administrative.
00:40:58.248,00:41:01.251,Not so much P.P....
00:41:01.293,00:41:03.253,I do still carry the gun.
00:41:03.295,00:41:06.339,No big deal.
00:41:06.381,00:41:08.425,Security blanket now.
00:41:08.466,00:41:10.843,"Of course, you're not supposed to think about it."
00:41:10.885,00:41:14.472,"In a situation where your man is threatened, training kicks in."
00:41:14.513,00:41:16.766,"It's muscle memory, just like that. Reflexes."
00:41:16.808,00:41:19.311,-It's...Those are outrageous.
00:41:19.352,00:41:21.479,-Go away!
00:41:21.520,00:41:23.148,Just let me touch.
00:41:23.189,00:41:24.732,Sake?
00:41:24.774,00:41:29.279,"There was a hell of a lot of political infighting and petty, petty shit."
00:41:29.321,00:41:31.906,"And then basically, the old man stepped on Guyberger's throat..."
00:41:31.948,00:41:36.535,This is nice.
00:41:36.577,00:41:40.457,"Yeah. Listen, Linda."
00:41:40.498,00:41:44.085,"Yes, I am not wearing a wedding ring, but I am married."
00:41:44.127,00:41:47.546,I took the ring off about 18 months ago when we agreed to separate.
00:41:47.588,00:41:50.883,Agreed to disagree.
00:41:50.925,00:41:54.553,"Thanks for telling me, Harry."
00:41:54.595,00:41:58.099,"Well, you know, full transparency is my M.O."
00:41:59.017,00:42:01.560,"Oh, that's not gonna go off, is it?"
00:42:01.602,00:42:04.230,"Well, let's get in the other room and find out, hmm?"
00:42:04.272,00:42:06.232,Whoa!
00:42:16.201,00:42:18.411,That's great.
00:42:18.453,00:42:21.080,"Yeah, he's very, very communicative, very accessible."
00:42:21.122,00:42:24.501,Has a sense of humor.
00:42:24.542,00:42:26.878,"-Well, I-- -He agrees my ass could be smaller."
00:42:26.919,00:42:29.881,"I mean, not in a mean way."
00:42:29.922,00:42:32.008,That's good.
00:42:32.050,00:42:34.635,"But, uh, Linda, what do you really know about this guy?"
00:42:34.677,00:42:37.514,"I told you, he's in the Treasury Department."
00:42:37.555,00:42:42.601,"But... No, I mean, you know, he could be one of these guys that cruises the Internet."
00:42:42.643,00:42:44.562,Yeah. So am I.
00:42:45.688,00:42:48.649,What's wrong with this?
00:42:48.691,00:42:51.569,"No, you cannot wear that!"
00:42:51.610,00:42:54.864,"You mean, go home and change?"
00:42:56.324,00:42:58.410,I was gonna ride my bike.
00:43:44.163,00:43:46.458,Osborne Cox?
00:43:49.127,00:43:52.213,"And you, I take it, are Mr. Black?"
00:43:52.255,00:43:54.340,"Yes, I am."
00:43:55.592,00:43:57.635,You have the money?
00:43:58.719,00:44:01.639,"The $50,000?"
00:44:01.680,00:44:05.268,"That's what was agreed upon, Osborne Cox."
00:44:06.685,00:44:10.231,All right.
00:44:10.273,00:44:12.691,You know who I am.
00:44:12.733,00:44:15.069,Perhaps.
00:44:15.111,00:44:18.615,But appearances can be deceptive.
00:44:18.656,00:44:20.283,Yeah.
00:44:20.325,00:44:23.702,What you're engaged in is blackmail.
00:44:23.744,00:44:26.705,That is a felony.
00:44:26.747,00:44:29.917,Appearances can be deceptive.
00:44:29.959,00:44:40.719,"I'm a mere Good Samaritan who happened upon a-- Secondly, the unauthorized dissemination of classified material is a federal crime."
00:44:40.761,00:44:46.725,"If you ever carried out your proposed threat, you would experience such a shit storm..."
00:44:46.767,00:44:56.027,"of consequences, my friend, that your empty little head would be spinning faster than the wheels of your Schwinn bicycle back there."
00:44:56.068,00:44:58.196,You think that's a Schwinn?
00:44:58.237,00:45:07.997,"Now, give me the fucking floppy, or the CD, or whatever the fuck it is-- As soon as you give us the money, dickwad!"
00:45:13.085,00:45:16.047,You fuck!
00:45:16.088,00:45:19.758,-You fucker!
00:45:19.800,00:45:22.761,-You're the fucker!
00:45:24.763,00:45:26.807,-Where's the money?
00:45:26.849,00:45:29.726,Where's the money?
00:45:29.768,00:45:31.896,He didn't give it to me!
00:45:31.937,00:45:34.607,Get in the car!
00:45:42.574,00:45:45.243,What are you doing?
00:45:45.284,00:45:47.744,Shit!
00:45:48.538,00:45:50.331,Fuck it!
00:45:51.332,00:45:54.377,Fuck! Fucking lunatic!
00:45:55.794,00:45:58.881,-Fucking...
00:45:58.923,00:46:01.884,-That'll give him something to think about.
00:46:01.926,00:46:03.802,Yeah!
00:46:03.844,00:46:06.972,"-Wait, wait."
00:46:07.014,00:46:10.643,That's just a Kryptonite lock.
00:46:10.685,00:46:12.645,Some people!
00:46:18.610,00:46:21.070,-What is this?
00:46:22.863,00:46:26.158,I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping by.
00:46:26.200,00:46:28.953,"Uh, is there a men's room?"
00:46:37.629,00:46:39.922,"Madam, you are mistaken."
00:46:39.964,00:46:43.926,I'm assistant cultural attaché.
00:46:43.968,00:46:49.098,The organs of state security are not allowed to function within the borders of your country.
00:46:49.140,00:46:51.517,Organs?
00:46:51.559,00:46:53.394,Yes.
00:46:54.895,00:46:59.275,"But what if I had, oh, say, secrets of a highly..."
00:46:59.317,00:47:02.528,secrets that might interest the organs of the...
00:47:03.613,00:47:05.615,Yes?
00:47:10.911,00:47:12.829,That's just a taste.
00:47:24.925,00:47:27.762,-May I ask the source of this material?
00:47:27.804,00:47:29.846,He's very high up.
00:47:29.888,00:47:32.141,What? I'm just saying he's high up.
00:47:36.937,00:47:38.189,P.C. or Mac?
00:47:38.230,00:47:39.273,-Uh-- -P.C.
00:47:39.315,00:47:43.152,P.C.
00:47:43.194,00:47:45.279,I-I do have a date.
00:47:47.114,00:47:49.534,Um...
00:47:49.575,00:47:51.577,Hey!
00:47:56.248,00:47:59.460,The fish has bitten.
00:47:59.502,00:48:03.506,"Huh? Oh, yeah."
00:48:05.966,00:48:07.884,Chad.
00:48:14.975,00:48:17.478,"Could you accompany me, please?"
00:48:29.824,00:48:31.950,There is more material?
00:48:31.992,00:48:35.454,"Oh, there's a lot more."
00:48:36.372,00:48:38.416,You are not ideological.
00:48:41.001,00:48:42.961,I don't think so.
00:48:43.003,00:48:46.048,"Look, I have a date, so..."
00:48:48.760,00:48:50.469,Date.
00:48:53.472,00:48:55.892,Uh-oh.
00:48:55.932,00:48:59.144,A line to check in.
00:48:59.186,00:49:01.522,And Manolo running around like crazy.
00:49:01.564,00:49:03.608,What happened to your nose?
00:49:03.649,00:49:06.694,"This is not acceptable at Hardbodies. Now, you two know better than that."
00:49:06.736,00:49:09.697,"Yes, we do, Ted."
00:49:09.739,00:49:12.074,"It was unavoidable, Ted."
00:49:12.116,00:49:14.993,But you won't tell me what's going on.
00:49:15.035,00:49:20.499,"I...I know this is really terrible, Ted, but I have to..."
00:49:20.541,00:49:22.627,I have a date.
00:49:24.211,00:49:26.297,"You're changing, Linda."
00:49:27.840,00:49:29.926,It's very sad.
00:49:39.435,00:49:42.563,"Which, to my mind, is all the more reason to lower the boom on Ozzie."
00:49:42.605,00:49:45.023,Mm-hmm.
00:49:45.065,00:49:47.025,Is that it?
00:49:47.067,00:49:53.783,"Hmm. Well, I'm wondering if it's the right time and-- Well, of course it's the right time. Why wouldn't it be the right time?"
00:49:53.825,00:49:56.034,Does this threaten you?
00:49:56.076,00:49:59.037,"You and me, we're rock solid."
00:49:59.079,00:50:01.415,I think that's why we can afford to be big.
00:50:01.457,00:50:07.129,We can think about Ozzie and whether we give him a chance to get himself together a bit before you hammer the hell out of him.
00:50:07.171,00:50:09.047,Is that how you see me?
00:50:09.089,00:50:11.049,Of course not.
00:50:11.091,00:50:12.635,Yeah.
00:50:12.677,00:50:15.721,"No, of course not. Listen."
00:50:15.763,00:50:17.932,I think he's an arrogant little geek.
00:50:17.974,00:50:22.353,"But you know, we have all the time in the world, and he just lost his job."
00:50:22.394,00:50:24.104,He didn't lose it.
00:50:24.146,00:50:27.107,"Yeah. Well, most of the people in this town who quit were fired."
00:50:27.149,00:50:30.068,I feel sorry for him.
00:50:30.110,00:50:34.030,I think he'll be a lot easier to deal with if he doesn't feel cornered.
00:50:37.618,00:50:38.995,Maybe.
00:50:39.035,00:50:41.205,"Just as long as we're talking about Ozzie here, not you."
00:50:41.246,00:50:44.082,Of course we're talking about Ozzie.
00:50:44.124,00:50:47.378,"I'll do whatever you want, baby."
00:50:51.298,00:50:53.342,You get the check.
00:50:53.384,00:50:56.178,Yup. Yes.
00:50:56.220,00:50:58.597,Is there blood in his stool?
00:50:58.639,00:51:01.057,Later.
00:51:02.518,00:51:04.812,Mmm.
00:51:14.613,00:51:16.615,Ozzie?
00:51:18.242,00:51:21.495,"Goddamn it, Ozzie!"
00:51:24.164,00:51:28.044,All right. All right.
00:51:44.184,00:51:47.312,"Oh, my God. Am I..."
00:51:47.354,00:51:50.148,Doesn't start for five minutes.
00:51:50.190,00:51:52.443,"You haven't seen this yet, have you?"
00:51:52.484,00:51:56.906,"Uh, this one?"
00:51:56.948,00:51:59.951,We've been over and over and over this.
00:51:59.992,00:52:02.745,"First you say you can't commit, and then..."
00:52:02.787,00:52:05.081,Would you come down from there?
00:52:06.373,00:52:08.626,That's not what those are for!
00:52:10.669,00:52:12.671,Good.
00:52:12.713,00:52:17.175,Pardon our dust.
00:52:17.217,00:52:20.178,"I told her to expedite things, but-- Yeah."
00:52:20.220,00:52:23.641,"Ah, you know, you try to act like an adult."
00:52:23.682,00:52:27.979,Mmm.
00:52:28.020,00:52:30.230,"Well, I'm always open to new experiences."
00:52:30.272,00:52:33.484,"I gotta tell you, I saw an ad for this in a gentlemen's magazine."
00:52:33.525,00:52:36.112,"It was 1,200 bucks."
00:52:36.152,00:52:39.197,"I'm looking at this thing, and I think, Jesus, you've gotta be kidding me."
00:52:39.239,00:52:42.994,I'm a hobbyist.
00:52:43.035,00:52:48.332,I figured I could go down to Home Depot and whip this up myself for a hundred bucks.
00:52:48.373,00:52:51.251,-What is it?
00:52:51.293,00:52:55.965,"You sit down there, make yourself comfortable."
00:52:56.007,00:52:58.884,"Put your feet in the stirrups, and..."
00:53:04.140,00:53:07.225,"Oh, my God!"
00:53:10.270,00:53:12.731,That's fantastic!
00:53:12.773,00:53:15.901,"Something, isn't it?"
00:53:15.943,00:53:18.529,And the cost of the dildo.
00:53:18.570,00:53:20.698,Uh-huh.
00:53:20.739,00:53:24.368,I'm not set up to mold hard rubber.
00:53:24.409,00:53:26.912,-The Russians?
00:53:26.954,00:53:29.707,-The Russians?
00:53:29.748,00:53:33.251,"Russian Embassy, yeah."
00:53:33.293,00:53:36.254,"Hey, the guy was not hard to follow, as you know."
00:53:36.296,00:53:39.633,Why the fuck would they go to the Russians?
00:53:39.675,00:53:41.760,Why the fuck?
00:53:44.930,00:53:47.516,I...I'm sorry.
00:53:47.558,00:53:49.643,"Hey, no problemo."
00:53:52.897,00:53:59.195,"Look, Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid old spook, but those two guys seem very interested in you."
00:54:01.321,00:54:03.949,"You haven't gone poofy on me, have you, Oz?"
00:54:07.327,00:54:09.287,Can I help you?
00:54:09.329,00:54:12.083,"I'm sorry if I was staring, but your face looks familiar."
00:54:12.124,00:54:14.418,"It's, uh, Princeton, '73?"
00:54:14.459,00:54:17.295,Yeah.
00:54:17.337,00:54:20.049,Osborne Cox.
00:54:20.091,00:54:22.968,Served and witnessed.
00:54:23.010,00:54:25.303,You have a real nice evening.
00:54:26.346,00:54:28.432,Ouch.
00:54:42.404,00:54:44.489,What the fuck?
00:54:49.327,00:54:52.081,What the fuck?
00:54:52.123,00:54:54.125,What the fuck?
00:55:05.301,00:55:17.231,Fuck! Fucking-- Why did you tell him we could get more stuff?
00:55:17.273,00:55:20.192,That's all Manolo found!
00:55:20.234,00:55:24.362,"What, are we gonna tell Manolo to scoop some more secret spy shit off the locker floor?"
00:55:24.404,00:55:26.364,Hey!
00:55:26.406,00:55:28.993,"I don't like the snideness, nor the negativity!"
00:55:29.034,00:55:31.369,I'm sorry.
00:55:31.411,00:55:33.705,"If I'm going to reinvent myself, I need these surgeries."
00:55:33.747,00:55:36.374,"These surgeries cost money, and this is not just fun and games."
00:55:36.416,00:55:38.418,I'm sorry.
00:55:38.460,00:55:40.545,"Chad, your Berry Blast is ready."
00:55:40.587,00:55:43.882,We know who he is.
00:55:43.924,00:55:46.551,"So, we can find out where he lives, right?"
00:55:46.593,00:55:49.805,"Um, I guess."
00:55:49.847,00:55:52.390,Why?
00:55:52.432,00:55:54.518,"There are certain elemental things, Chad."
00:55:54.559,00:55:57.395,Yes. We should take out the labels and the laundry marks.
00:55:57.437,00:56:00.524,Laundry marks?
00:58:31.383,00:58:33.551,What's the odometer say?
00:58:33.593,00:58:37.348,Five.
00:58:37.389,00:58:41.559,"-I mean-- -Oh, for fuck's sake, Harry."
00:58:41.601,00:58:45.481,Okay. I gotta do at least five.
00:58:45.522,00:58:48.400,I'm amazed you have the energy.
00:58:48.442,00:58:51.487,"-Pull around the corner, we'll do it in the back."
00:58:51.528,00:58:55.449,"No, back of the car."
00:58:55.491,00:58:57.493,I'm late.
01:03:11.246,01:03:13.248,Hello?
01:04:03.465,01:04:05.676,"Oh, my God."
01:04:05.717,01:04:07.719,"Oh, my God!"
01:04:21.692,01:04:23.694,Oh!
01:04:31.075,01:04:34.871,"Oh, my God."
01:04:37.499,01:04:39.876,Wait. Wait.
01:04:39.917,01:04:42.379,What the fuck?
01:04:49.969,01:04:53.724,What the fuck?
01:04:54.432,01:04:57.268,"Oh! Oh, my fuck!"
01:04:59.521,01:05:01.606,I killed a fucking spook.
01:05:02.982,01:05:06.236,"What the fuck are you doing here, you fucker?"
01:05:06.277,01:05:08.363,You...
01:05:26.339,01:05:28.425,"Olson, what's up?"
01:05:41.938,01:05:43.565,"Palmer, what's up?"
01:05:43.607,01:05:48.945,"Uh, not quite certain, sir, but it's messy."
01:05:48.986,01:05:55.076,"Kolyma-2 tells us they have computer files from an ex-analyst of mine, Osborne Cox."
01:05:55.118,01:05:57.287,Kolyma-2?
01:05:57.328,01:06:00.998,-Hmm.
01:05:57.328,01:06:03.585,-They were brought in to them by a woman-- The Russians?
01:06:03.627,01:06:10.508,"It was, uh, brought in by a woman named Linda Litzke, an associate of a guy named Harry Pfarrer."
01:06:10.550,01:06:13.010,"Picture's in the file, with Pfarrer's."
01:06:13.052,01:06:16.013,Yeah.
01:06:16.055,01:06:18.182,"Uh, who's Pfarrer?"
01:06:18.224,01:06:23.980,"Um, Treasury guy who has been, uh, screwing Mrs. Cox."
01:06:24.021,01:06:26.983,That must be how they got the files.
01:06:27.024,01:06:30.069,Or maybe Ozzie knows about them.
01:06:30.111,01:06:32.572,All right. Spare me.
01:06:32.614,01:06:34.658,"But, uh, this, um..."
01:06:34.699,01:06:39.036,"Um, it's, uh..."
01:06:39.078,01:06:44.793,"Uh, he just shot somebody in Ozzie's house."
01:06:46.002,01:06:48.045,Shot your analyst?
01:06:48.087,01:06:50.047,"No, Ozzie wasn't there."
01:06:50.089,01:06:58.055,"Um, our man surveilling hears a gunshot, sees the guy wrestle something into his car, follows him."
01:06:58.097,01:07:00.141,He dumps a body in the Chesapeake Bay.
01:07:00.183,01:07:02.393,"Well, what did he do that for?"
01:07:02.435,01:07:04.437,"Don't know, sir."
01:07:04.479,01:07:07.064,"-Well, for Christ's sake, did anyone fish the body out?"
01:07:07.106,01:07:09.400,And Russian? American?
01:07:10.902,01:07:14.364,"And this, uh, Linda-- Linda Litzke."
01:07:14.405,01:07:17.283,Yeah.
01:07:17.325,01:07:22.079,"We're, um..."
01:07:22.121,01:07:25.625,"So, we don't really know what anyone is after?"
01:07:25.667,01:07:27.502,"Not really, sir."
01:07:27.544,01:07:31.172,"And this, uh, analyst..."
01:07:27.544,01:07:34.091,ex-analyst... Uh-- Cox.
01:07:34.133,01:07:36.636,What's his clearance level?
01:07:37.846,01:07:39.890,Okay. No biggie.
01:07:39.931,01:07:44.019,"Just... For now, just, uh, keep an eye on everyone, see what they do."
01:07:44.060,01:07:48.690,"Yes, sir."
01:07:48.732,01:07:51.401,"No! No, God, no."
01:07:51.442,01:07:53.486,Burn the body.
01:07:53.528,01:07:58.115,"And, uh, keep an eye on everyone, see what they do."
01:07:58.157,01:08:00.117,"Report back to me when, uh..."
01:08:02.871,01:08:06.082,I don't know.
01:08:09.335,01:08:11.588,Go!
01:08:11.629,01:08:13.590,"Up, up, and tap."
01:08:13.631,01:08:15.717,"Up, up, and tap."
01:08:15.759,01:08:19.178,Let's add the arms right here.
01:08:19.220,01:08:23.266,I'm bigger. I'm back.
01:08:23.307,01:08:25.393,Than ever. I'm back.
01:08:25.435,01:08:28.145,You fuckers. I'm back.
01:08:28.187,01:08:30.523,You fuckers. I'm back.
01:08:41.367,01:08:44.203,Linda? You okay?
01:08:44.245,01:08:47.164,"Yeah. I'm fine, Ted."
01:08:47.206,01:08:52.169,"No, no, I'm... I'm-- But you won't tell me what's wrong."
01:08:52.211,01:08:54.171,"You never let me in, Linda."
01:08:54.213,01:08:56.173,"Oh, I know you're trustworthy."
01:08:56.215,01:08:59.176,I just... I don't want to endanger other people.
01:08:59.218,01:09:03.098,"I mean, this is the path that I've chosen. It's not..."
01:09:03.139,01:09:06.601,"You have to isolate, you know. Firewall!"
01:09:08.645,01:09:11.064,"Yeah, well, I don't know what to think."
01:09:11.106,01:09:14.567,"You both go AWOL on Friday, and today Chad doesn't even bother to come in at all."
01:09:14.609,01:09:16.736,"I know, Ted."
01:09:16.778,01:09:19.196,"I know, Ted."
01:09:19.238,01:09:21.198,"No, no, no!"
01:09:21.240,01:09:24.410,Give me 24 hours!
01:09:24.452,01:09:26.412,I don't know!
01:09:26.454,01:09:30.959,Linda-- Just give me 24 hours to solve this thing!
01:09:32.251,01:09:34.211,"Linda, I have to tell you."
01:09:34.253,01:09:36.631,A man was in here earlier asking about you.
01:09:36.673,01:09:39.216,Are you... Are you in some kind of trouble?
01:09:39.258,01:09:41.218,Is Chad running away from something?
01:09:41.260,01:09:44.764,"We know what we're doing, Ted."
01:09:44.806,01:09:47.308,"Well, yes, he was asking about you."
01:09:47.350,01:09:49.352,"Employment history, et cetera."
01:09:49.393,01:09:52.856,I told him to get lost.
01:09:54.482,01:09:58.235,"Well, we just don't give that out at Hardbodies."
01:09:58.277,01:10:01.906,a Mr. Krapotkin on line two.
01:10:05.326,01:10:07.286,Mr. Krapkin?
01:10:07.328,01:10:09.288,Yes?
01:10:09.330,01:10:12.291,"Yes, this is Ilan Krapotkin, Russian Embassy, returning your call."
01:10:12.333,01:10:15.419,"Yes, yes, hang on."
01:10:22.677,01:10:24.637,Mr. Krapkin?
01:10:24.679,01:10:27.765,Is this a secure line?
01:10:27.807,01:10:31.769,"Mr. Krapkin, is this a secure l-- Are you joking?"
01:10:31.811,01:10:34.772,"I'm very worried about my associate, you know, my..."
01:10:34.814,01:10:36.774,Chad.
01:10:36.816,01:10:38.776,Do you have him?
01:10:38.818,01:10:40.778,Do we have him?
01:10:40.820,01:10:43.948,Is he... Was he...
01:10:43.990,01:10:46.784,I don't understand.
01:10:46.826,01:10:53.958,"No. I-- Um-- Look, could I come in and discuss this?"
01:10:54.000,01:10:57.294,"Uh, I'm very busy at the moment."
01:10:57.336,01:10:58.379,I'm coming anyway.
01:11:15.063,01:11:17.148,You seem distracted.
01:11:18.357,01:11:20.359,Do I?
01:11:20.401,01:11:23.529,Mmm. Very distracted the last few days.
01:11:23.571,01:11:25.531,Work.
01:11:27.575,01:11:29.786,You think that might be enough carrots?
01:11:32.622,01:11:34.582,What?
01:11:34.624,01:11:36.709,For the salad?
01:11:39.587,01:11:42.590,"You know, you really are a negative person."
01:11:43.591,01:11:45.260,What?
01:11:45.301,01:11:49.305,"I've tried to ignore it, to remain upbeat."
01:11:49.346,01:11:51.432,"Harry, stop the foolishness."
01:11:51.474,01:11:53.977,-Stop the foolishness?
01:11:54.018,01:11:57.897,You're not speaking to one of your shit-hole buddies.
01:12:52.368,01:12:54.329,Hello?
01:12:54.370,01:12:57.332,Honey? It's so good to hear your voice.
01:12:57.373,01:12:59.709,"- Something wrong, Harry?"
01:12:59.750,01:13:01.711,Yeah.
01:13:01.752,01:13:04.672,Can you come home?
01:13:04.714,01:13:06.674,Can you please come home?
01:13:06.716,01:13:10.303,"Harry, you know I can't just leave the book tour."
01:13:10.345,01:13:12.555,I can show you your present.
01:13:12.596,01:13:14.640,"Oh, Harry, I can't just leave."
01:13:14.682,01:13:18.394,There are two days left.
01:13:19.729,01:13:21.689,Yeah.
01:13:21.731,01:13:23.691,"I love you, Harry."
01:13:23.733,01:13:25.693,Yeah.
01:13:25.735,01:13:27.820,I love you too.
01:13:34.369,01:13:36.704,"Hey, fucker!"
01:13:40.708,01:13:42.626,Fucker!
01:13:43.544,01:13:45.588,Fucker!
01:13:52.387,01:13:55.639,Fucker!
01:13:55.681,01:13:57.725,Who do you work for?
01:14:02.438,01:14:04.481,Who are you?
01:14:04.523,01:14:07.443,Who are you?
01:14:07.484,01:14:09.320,N.S.C.?
01:14:09.362,01:14:11.072,What?
01:14:11.114,01:14:12.823,Tuchman Marsh?
01:14:12.865,01:14:15.993,Your name's Tuchman Marsh?
01:14:16.035,01:14:18.037,I work for them.
01:14:18.079,01:14:20.039,Yes.
01:14:20.081,01:14:22.499,Is that a law firm?
01:14:22.541,01:14:25.295,"Yes, it's a law firm."
01:14:25.336,01:14:27.463,"Divorce action, numb nuts."
01:14:29.548,01:14:31.884,My wife hired you?
01:14:31.926,01:14:33.886,No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
01:14:33.928,01:14:36.513,Tuchman Marsh hired me.
01:14:45.898,01:14:49.068,Sandy.
01:14:49.110,01:14:51.070,"Jesus, grow up, man."
01:14:51.112,01:14:53.489,It happens to everybody.
01:14:58.411,01:15:05.042,And at midnight of the third day even the sergeant-at-arms fell asleep.
01:15:05.084,01:15:11.715,And it was just then at that very moment that Oliver sneezed!
01:15:11.757,01:15:14.344,Could we just...
01:15:14.385,01:15:17.972,You have to let the folks at home see this illustration.
01:15:18.014,01:15:19.974,There. There it is.
01:15:20.016,01:15:25.271,It's Oliver interrupting the filibuster with-- That's wonderful!
01:15:25.313,01:15:27.564,"The book is Point of Order, Oliver!"
01:15:27.606,01:15:30.318,And the talented author is Sandra Pfarrer.
01:15:30.360,01:15:34.571,She'll stay with us for our next segment when we meet the Sultan of Salad.
01:15:34.613,01:15:38.034,And then it's part two of our very special interview with Dermot Mulroney.
01:15:38.075,01:15:40.036,So keep it where it is.
01:15:42.079,01:15:44.040,That was way out of line.
01:15:44.081,01:15:47.043,We were so unbelievably clear with them it's just an Oliver segment.
01:15:47.084,01:15:49.586,It's fine. Thank you.
01:15:49.628,01:15:52.840,I thought that would never end.
01:15:52.882,01:15:55.592,Mmm.
01:15:55.634,01:15:58.595,Mmm.
01:15:58.637,01:16:02.266,Let me get this crap off my face.
01:16:21.660,01:16:24.205,What the fuck?
01:16:30.920,01:16:33.756,"Yes, madam."
01:16:33.797,01:16:36.759,What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are you running anyway?
01:16:36.800,01:16:38.761,I've been waiting for 45 minutes!
01:16:38.802,01:16:41.389,"I'm so sorry, madam."
01:16:41.431,01:16:46.185,"Well, maybe this is an urgent matter since, you know, Chad's been missing for 48 hours."
01:16:46.227,01:16:48.938,"I do not know the whereabouts of Mr. Chad, madam."
01:16:48.979,01:16:53.109,He was gathering information for you when he was taken.
01:16:53.150,01:16:56.028,We are not interested in such information.
01:16:56.070,01:16:58.155,It was drivel.
01:16:59.198,01:17:01.284,Dribble?
01:17:01.325,01:17:03.494,"Would you like your disk back, madam?"
01:17:03.536,01:17:05.496,Dribble?
01:17:05.538,01:17:08.499,I will give you dribble!
01:17:08.541,01:17:11.210,"I am a U.S. citizen, and I will not take this kind of treatment!"
01:17:16.882,01:17:21.678,My check was returned for insufficient funds.
01:17:21.720,01:17:23.680,No.
01:17:23.722,01:17:26.683,"No, there are over $40,000 in that account."
01:17:26.725,01:17:28.852,The account is not overdrawn.
01:17:30.020,01:17:32.064,When?
01:17:32.106,01:17:35.610,But how could she have access?
01:17:32.106,01:17:40.197,"We-- Uh, n..."
01:17:40.239,01:17:42.283,Mm-hmm.
01:17:42.325,01:17:44.701,No.
01:17:44.743,01:17:57.798,"I don't know the number to, uh, my savings account because, believe it or not, I don't spend my entire day sitting around trying to memorize the fucking numbers to my fucking bank accounts, moron!"
01:18:09.893,01:18:11.854,No way. No!
01:18:11.895,01:18:14.898,No way. Whoa.
01:18:14.940,01:18:17.443,-No.
01:18:17.485,01:18:20.446,-I don't know anything about computers.
01:18:20.488,01:18:23.907,It was crazy the first time.
01:18:23.949,01:18:27.537,You said the Russians didn't even want this stuff!
01:18:27.578,01:18:30.540,"Well, my world is bigger than that, Ted."
01:18:30.581,01:18:32.708,There are the Chinese!
01:18:30.581,01:18:36.128,"Linda, these surgeries-- It's not about the surgeries."
01:18:36.170,01:18:38.130,"What do you mean, get him back?"
01:18:38.172,01:18:40.424,"Information is power, Ted."
01:18:40.466,01:18:43.093,Get him back?
01:18:43.135,01:18:46.013,"Somebody has him, Ted."
01:18:43.135,01:18:49.517,We can use this to get-- -Call the police if you want to get back missing people!
01:18:49.559,01:18:53.229,You know I can't do that!
01:18:53.270,01:18:55.189,-This is higher than the police.
01:18:53.270,01:18:59.318,"-Linda-- I need a can-do person, Ted!"
01:18:59.360,01:19:01.737,I hate you!
01:19:12.248,01:19:14.333,What'll it be?
01:19:15.501,01:19:17.961,Seven and seven.
01:19:22.841,01:19:25.595,Hello?
01:19:25.636,01:19:28.556,You think a marriage is...
01:19:28.598,01:19:30.558,And then it's...
01:19:32.851,01:19:36.230,But this has all been a long time coming.
01:19:37.398,01:19:39.358,Was it?
01:19:39.400,01:19:41.318,"Oh, well, yeah, right."
01:19:41.360,01:19:43.446,I'm just depressed.
01:19:46.115,01:19:49.076,I gotta exercise.
01:19:49.118,01:19:51.287,Butt crunches.
01:19:51.328,01:19:53.830,You think maybe I could stay here for a little while?
01:19:53.872,01:19:57.293,"Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no."
01:19:57.334,01:19:59.295,I'm not that strong.
01:19:59.336,01:20:01.714,"You are not here for me, Harry."
01:20:01.756,01:20:04.841,I need a can-do person.
01:20:04.883,01:20:07.844,"Chad is the only can-do person I know, and now he's gone!"
01:20:07.886,01:20:10.806,"-I'm sorry, baby."
01:20:10.847,01:20:13.809,I'll be good.
01:20:13.850,01:20:16.479,If you have a pedestrian path or something...
01:20:16.520,01:20:19.482,He's my friend from work.
01:20:19.523,01:20:22.485,You know law enforcement people.
01:20:22.526,01:20:25.488,Hold on. What happened?
01:20:25.529,01:20:28.865,And he just disappeared.
01:20:28.907,01:20:30.867,Okay. You know his social security number?
01:20:30.909,01:20:33.870,No! I-- Okay. Where was the last place you saw him?
01:20:33.912,01:20:35.872,"No, I don't know."
01:20:35.914,01:20:39.376,The Jamba Juice on K Street.
01:20:39.418,01:20:41.878,"No, okay, now."
01:20:41.920,01:20:45.800,We're gonna find your little buddy.
01:20:45.841,01:20:47.760,Piece of cake.
01:20:47.802,01:20:50.513,Okay.
01:20:50.554,01:20:53.557,Open your mouth. Open it.
01:20:53.599,01:20:57.894,Come on. Open your mouth.
01:20:57.936,01:21:03.900,"You do as I say, or I'm gonna ask your mother to leave the doctor's room, and you and I are gonna sort it out between us."
01:21:08.531,01:21:10.991,Hello?
01:21:11.033,01:21:13.076,I'm with a patient.
01:21:13.118,01:21:17.080,And this is the same fucking patient she's been with since yesterday?
01:21:17.122,01:21:20.334,You tell Dr. Cox I have the new keys!
01:21:37.017,01:21:38.894,"Hey there, sunshine."
01:21:40.855,01:21:44.191,You seem better.
01:21:44.233,01:21:47.528,And our exercise last night didn't hurt.
01:21:47.570,01:21:50.531,"Boy, I tell you, I'm through banging my head against the wall."
01:21:50.573,01:21:52.949,I'm gonna start doing what's right for me.
01:21:52.991,01:21:55.994,I believe that also. You have to do what's right for you.
01:21:56.036,01:21:59.956,I had a shock recently and I realized life is not infinite and that no one is immortal.
01:21:59.998,01:22:03.960,I think it's very important to maintain a positive attitude.
01:22:04.002,01:22:05.504,Don't sweat the small stuff.
01:22:05.546,01:22:08.924,And it's all small stuff.
01:22:26.024,01:22:28.903,Just for starters.
01:22:30.987,01:22:32.948,"Ah, boy."
01:22:32.989,01:22:35.325,"Ah, why..."
01:22:35.367,01:22:39.329,This is where we first met.
01:22:39.371,01:22:42.958,It's hard to know what the important days are until you...
01:22:45.043,01:22:50.173,"Now, I told myself that I wasn't going to be paranoid, but is that guy looking at us?"
01:22:51.926,01:22:53.886,No. Uh-uh.
01:22:53.928,01:22:57.013,Have you found out anything about Chad?
01:22:57.055,01:23:00.643,I put in a couple of calls.
01:23:00.684,01:23:03.938,"Oh, yeah. There's so many databases now, it's a joke."
01:23:03.979,01:23:08.024,Back when I was in P.P.
01:23:08.066,01:23:10.068,Now with cell phones?
01:23:10.110,01:23:14.156,Pretty soon everybody is gonna know where you are at any given moment. Any given moment.
01:23:14.197,01:23:17.159,Did... All right.
01:23:17.200,01:23:22.205,"When you left Jamba Juice, did Chad give you any idea where he might be going?"
01:23:22.247,01:23:24.040,"Oh, I know where he was going."
01:23:24.082,01:23:25.751,You do?
01:23:25.793,01:23:28.337,Olive Street.
01:23:28.378,01:23:30.339,160 Olive Street.
01:23:30.380,01:23:34.009,"It's the residence of this guy, um, Osborne Cox."
01:23:42.017,01:23:44.227,Who are you?
01:23:45.479,01:23:47.564,What?
01:23:48.565,01:23:50.901,Who are you?
01:23:50.943,01:23:54.070,N.S.A.?
01:23:54.112,01:23:56.031,Who do you work for?
01:23:57.115,01:23:58.784,Who do you work for?
01:23:58.826,01:24:00.703,Who are you?
01:24:02.078,01:24:04.039,I'm just...
01:24:05.123,01:24:07.083,Linda Litzke.
01:24:07.125,01:24:09.628,You...
01:24:18.094,01:24:21.056,You... Y...
01:24:22.057,01:24:24.059,Harry!
01:26:10.082,01:26:12.542,"Oh, for Pete's sake!"
01:26:45.283,01:26:48.662,And you are my wife's lover?
01:26:50.914,01:26:54.001,No.
01:26:55.794,01:26:57.754,I know you.
01:26:57.796,01:27:00.382,You're the guy from the gym.
01:27:00.423,01:27:02.676,I'm not here representing Hardbodies.
01:27:02.718,01:27:06.763,"Oh, yes."
01:27:06.805,01:27:09.641,You represent the idiocy of today.
01:27:11.727,01:27:14.270,I don't represent that either.
01:27:14.312,01:27:17.315,You're the guy at the gym when I asked about that moronic woman.
01:27:17.357,01:27:19.526,She's not a moron.
01:27:19.568,01:27:22.071,You're in league with that moronic woman.
01:27:22.112,01:27:25.074,You're part of a league of morons.
01:27:25.115,01:27:27.283,No. No.
01:27:27.325,01:27:31.747,"You see, you're one of the morons i've been fighting my whole life."
01:27:31.788,01:27:34.666,My whole fucking life.
01:27:34.708,01:27:36.793,But guess what.
01:27:37.961,01:27:40.047,"Today, I win."
01:27:40.089,01:27:42.841,"Oh, God."
01:27:49.723,01:27:51.641,Halt!
01:27:51.683,01:27:54.644,Intruder!
01:27:54.686,01:27:56.438,Stop!
01:27:56.479,01:27:58.440,Intruder! Stop!
01:28:02.402,01:28:05.072,Wait.
01:28:06.865,01:28:10.285,"W-Where is the, uh..."
01:28:10.326,01:28:12.287,Right now?
01:28:12.328,01:28:15.082,"Um, he is in a detention room in Washington Dulles."
01:28:15.124,01:28:18.627,-Why?
01:28:18.668,01:28:23.257,We had his name on a hot list.
01:28:23.298,01:28:26.760,"Uh, don't know why he was trying to go to Venezuela."
01:28:26.802,01:28:28.762,You don't know?
01:28:28.804,01:28:30.764,"No, sir."
01:28:30.806,01:28:33.142,We have no extradition with Venezuela.
01:28:33.183,01:28:35.435,Oh.
01:28:35.477,01:28:39.648,So what should we do with him?
01:28:39.689,01:28:41.900,"Yes, sir. Okay."
01:28:41.942,01:28:44.778,"Okay, so the gym manager is dead."
01:28:44.820,01:28:46.863,"Yes, sir."
01:28:44.820,01:28:49.365,"The body is-- Uh, that's gone, sir."
01:28:49.407,01:28:51.493,-Okay.
01:28:51.534,01:28:55.371,"Uh, but there was a, um, snag."
01:28:55.413,01:28:57.791,What?
01:28:57.833,01:29:04.380,"Well, um, this, uh, analyst, Cox, was attacking the gym guy."
01:29:04.422,01:29:07.383,"Um, it was in broad daylight, on the street."
01:29:07.425,01:29:11.387,"Our man, uh, did not know what to do, felt he had to step in."
01:29:11.429,01:29:13.389,Yes?
01:29:13.431,01:29:16.434,"He, um..."
01:29:16.476,01:29:20.147,He shot the analyst.
01:29:21.148,01:29:22.941,Good.
01:29:22.983,01:29:25.443,Great.
01:29:25.485,01:29:27.988,"No, sir."
01:29:28.030,01:29:30.991,They don't think he's gonna make it.
01:29:31.033,01:29:34.703,"They're pretty sure that he has no, uh... no brain function."
01:29:34.744,01:29:36.705,Okay. Okay.
01:29:36.746,01:29:39.124,"If he wakes up, we'll worry about it then."
01:29:39.166,01:29:41.543,"Jesus, what a cluster fuck."
01:29:41.584,01:29:46.048,So that's... that's it then.
01:29:46.089,01:29:52.428,"Um... Uh, well, sir, um, there is-- What?"
01:29:52.470,01:29:55.640,-What?
01:29:55.682,01:29:57.934,The gym woman.
01:29:57.976,01:30:01.021,"Oh, fuck! Yeah. God."
01:30:01.063,01:30:04.024,"-Oh, we picked her up."
01:30:04.066,01:30:06.360,We have her?
01:30:06.400,01:30:11.907,"She says she'll, uh, play ball if we pay for, um, some..."
01:30:11.948,01:30:17.120,I know this sounds odd...
01:30:17.162,01:30:18.955,Cosmetic surgery.
01:30:18.997,01:30:21.958,She says she'll sit on everything.
01:30:22.000,01:30:25.379,-How much?
01:30:22.000,01:30:28.382,Altogether they come to-- -Pay it.
01:30:31.593,01:30:33.762,Jesus fucking Christ.
01:30:36.014,01:30:37.974,"What did we learn, Palmer?"
01:30:38.016,01:30:40.185,"I don't know, sir."
01:30:40.227,01:30:43.230,I don't fuckin' know either.
01:30:43.272,01:30:46.233,-I guess we learned not to do it again.
01:30:46.275,01:30:48.318,I'm fucked if I know what we did.
01:30:48.360,01:30:50.362,"Yes, sir."
01:30:51.529,01:30:54.824,Jesus fucking Christ.
01:35:19.297,01:35:21.257,Hit me!
