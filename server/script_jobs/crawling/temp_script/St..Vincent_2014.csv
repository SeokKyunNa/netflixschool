00:00:46.630,00:00:54.513,"MAN: So this Irish guy knocks on this lady's door and says, you know, Have you got any, uh, any, uh, work for me?"
00:00:54.555,00:00:59.727,"And she says, um, Well, you know, as a matter of fact, you-you could paint the porch."
00:01:02.813,00:01:13.073,"But two hours later, the guy comes back and says, I'm already finished, ma'am, but just, uh, for your information, it's not a Porsche, it's a BMW."
00:02:01.204,00:02:02.706,"Okay, asshole."
00:02:03.749,00:02:04.750,Giddyap.
00:02:10.089,00:02:16.011,TV ANNOUNCER: The female lemur is a better jumper and more efficient forager than her male counterpart.
00:02:16.053,00:02:19.056,She has dominance over the male...
00:02:19.098,00:02:20.515,"Oh, my God."
00:02:20.557,00:02:22.559,Feel this.
00:02:22.601,00:02:24.519,Baby's kicking. Feel.
00:02:24.561,00:02:25.896,Touch it.
00:02:25.938,00:02:26.981,"No, not my boob."
00:02:27.022,00:02:29.149,Here.
00:02:29.190,00:02:31.359,Sorry we woke you up.
00:02:33.988,00:02:36.782,"It was him, this asshole."
00:02:46.541,00:02:47.918,What's this?
00:02:47.960,00:02:49.837,I'm a little tight right now.
00:02:49.878,00:02:51.922,My shit is not layaway.
00:02:51.964,00:02:53.256,I'm not JCPenney.
00:02:53.298,00:02:54.549,You know I'm good for it.
00:02:54.591,00:02:55.884,"Well, I don't make like before, Vin."
00:02:55.926,00:02:58.595,Only a few freaks like the belly.
00:02:58.637,00:03:02.474,I have to save for maternity leave.
00:03:02.516,00:03:04.434,"Hey, I like the belly, okay?"
00:03:04.476,00:03:06.603,I'll see you next Tuesday.
00:03:06.645,00:03:09.648,"Extra when you do, okay? Double."
00:03:11.775,00:03:13.861,This one here says the line is frozen.
00:03:13.902,00:03:19.158,"Yes, with these reverse mortgages, you can only borrow a percentage of the equity you have in the house."
00:03:19.198,00:03:21.200,That's called the loan-to-value.
00:03:21.242,00:03:28.458,"But now, since you've been getting monthly payments from us for the last, uh, eight years, you've reached the cash-out limit."
00:03:28.500,00:03:30.836,That's that loan-to-value thing I just mentioned.
00:03:30.878,00:03:32.838,The house is worth...
00:03:32.880,00:03:34.048,It was worth.
00:03:34.089,00:03:36.591,Whatever it was worth.
00:03:36.633,00:03:38.635,I need that money.
00:03:38.677,00:03:42.764,"I-I'm sorry, Mr. MacKenna, there's really nothing I can do."
00:03:42.806,00:03:43.974,It is what it is.
00:03:44.016,00:03:46.935,It is what it is?
00:03:46.977,00:03:48.436,Everyone's saying that now.
00:03:48.478,00:03:49.813,You know what it means?
00:03:49.855,00:03:53.901,"You're screwed, and you shall remain screwed."
00:04:13.754,00:04:16.006,I want to close this account.
00:04:16.048,00:04:17.174,"I'm so sorry to hear that, sir."
00:04:17.216,00:04:18.967,May I ask why?
00:04:19.009,00:04:22.971,"Lady, you're just a spoke on a wheel, trying to make a living like the rest of us schmucks."
00:04:23.013,00:04:27.517,"I do not want to tell you to go fuck yourself, so let's..."
00:04:27.559,00:04:29.269,"Let's just leave it at that, please."
00:04:29.310,00:04:31.897,Okay.
00:04:34.524,00:04:37.318,$112.14.
00:04:37.360,00:04:39.571,"All right, small bills."
00:04:39.613,00:04:40.989,"No, sir."
00:04:41.031,00:04:42.449,You're overdrawn that much.
00:04:42.490,00:04:43.992,What does that mean?
00:04:44.034,00:04:47.370,You took out more money than you actually have in your account.
00:04:47.412,00:04:48.455,Here's zero.
00:04:48.496,00:04:49.790,You went below zero.
00:04:49.831,00:04:53.085,So I... can't close this account?
00:04:53.127,00:04:54.628,You can.
00:04:54.669,00:04:56.504,Once you get it back to zero.
00:04:59.382,00:05:01.969,"Hey, you taking care of yourself, Vin?"
00:05:02.010,00:05:04.304,"Yeah, blurry eyes."
00:05:04.345,00:05:06.556,"I'm doing aerobics, can't you tell?"
00:05:06.598,00:05:09.977,I'm doing the Jane Fonda workout.
00:05:10.018,00:05:14.898,"A one, two, three, and stretch."
00:05:14.940,00:05:17.776,MAN: Janie's still looking good.
00:05:17.818,00:05:26.827,"Roger, is there any chance you could ever make one of these that's strong enough for someone that's not, uh, Why don't we give it a break for a minute."
00:05:26.868,00:05:29.121,-Give what a break?
00:05:29.163,00:05:31.165,You're not gonna serve me?
00:05:31.206,00:05:33.083,Don't be like that.
00:05:33.125,00:05:34.793,I'm watching out for you here.
00:05:34.835,00:05:36.795,You watching out for me?
00:05:36.837,00:05:41.049,You serve poison all day to all these people that don't know no better.
00:05:41.091,00:05:42.843,So they can die while they're living.
00:05:42.884,00:05:45.012,And you're watching out for me.
00:05:45.053,00:05:47.555,You phony.
00:07:12.724,00:07:17.187,"Oh, Blanche, these are my friends Rose and Dorothy."
00:07:22.567,00:07:23.944,Come here.
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.010,Shut up!
00:08:30.051,00:08:32.095,People are sleeping!
00:08:37.184,00:08:39.102,"Ah, piss."
00:08:49.321,00:08:50.738,Hey! What's going on?!
00:08:50.780,00:08:53.116,-You habla English?
00:08:53.158,00:08:55.702,"Yes, we speak English, senor."
00:08:55.743,00:08:58.997,Then what the hell are you doing here?
00:08:59.039,00:09:02.917,That's my tree you assholes hit.
00:09:02.959,00:09:04.669,And my fence.
00:09:04.711,00:09:06.338,And my damn car.
00:09:06.380,00:09:09.049,Do you speak English?
00:09:09.090,00:09:11.843,-Stay here.
00:09:11.885,00:09:13.970,I'm calling the cops.
00:09:14.012,00:09:15.722,Is everybody okay?
00:09:15.763,00:09:17.516,-What do you want?
00:09:17.557,00:09:19.059,I'm your new neighbor.
00:09:19.100,00:09:20.435,So?
00:09:20.477,00:09:22.979,"Well, we're moving in."
00:09:23.021,00:09:25.023,"Uh, I can see that, yeah."
00:09:25.065,00:09:26.274,Are these dipshits with you?
00:09:26.316,00:09:31.612,"Yes, they're the men I hired from the moving company."
00:09:31.654,00:09:32.947,"Oh, boy."
00:09:32.989,00:09:35.242,"Oh, boy? No."
00:09:35.283,00:09:36.826,This fence is 20 years old.
00:09:36.868,00:09:38.745,The car's 30.
00:09:38.786,00:09:42.165,The tree is older than I am.
00:09:42.207,00:09:44.709,"Well, I'm sorry."
00:09:44.751,00:09:47.045,I'm not sure what I'm...
00:09:47.087,00:09:49.339,"This is not how I wanted to meet, either."
00:09:49.381,00:09:50.465,Did you do this?
00:09:50.507,00:09:51.716,Of course they did it.
00:09:51.758,00:09:53.051,"What are you, stupid?"
00:09:53.093,00:09:54.553,-Look at the crime scene.
00:09:53.093,00:09:56.471,"-Okay, you don't have to be rude to me!"
00:09:54.594,00:09:58.890,I'm just trying to move in here; I hired these guys to do it.
00:09:58.932,00:10:00.058,And accidents happen.
00:10:02.685,00:10:04.396,"Well, the car is an antique, missy."
00:10:04.438,00:10:06.273,"I mean, it's worth a lot."
00:10:06.314,00:10:07.399,Then I'll take care of it.
00:10:08.816,00:10:09.984,You-you don't got no money.
00:10:10.026,00:10:14.072,"What? I mean, no offense, but you just don't look like you do. Okay?"
00:10:14.114,00:10:16.366,And I'm sure Chico and the Man here are off the books.
00:10:16.408,00:10:19.494,"No, I will sue the moving company."
00:10:19.536,00:10:23.039,You can buck up for the fence and the tree.
00:10:25.708,00:10:26.960,Fine.
00:10:29.254,00:10:30.422,Toodles.
00:10:30.464,00:10:32.006,Is that our new neighbor?
00:10:32.048,00:10:33.467,Yep.
00:10:33.508,00:10:35.009,It's gonna be a long life.
00:10:36.553,00:10:42.892,"'Well,' said the tree, straightening herself up as much as she could, 'An old stump is good for sitting and resting."
00:10:42.934,00:10:44.769,"Come, boy, sit down."
00:10:44.811,00:10:47.814,Sit down and rest.' And the boy did.
00:10:47.855,00:10:50.900,And the tree was happy.
00:10:50.942,00:10:52.444,"God, that's depressing."
00:10:52.486,00:10:53.987,"No, it's not."
00:10:54.028,00:11:00.118,"The tree was meant to give, so to be able to give everything and have nothing left is the best life the tree could ever have."
00:11:00.160,00:11:03.204,"Well, your father must think I'm a tree."
00:11:03.246,00:11:04.789,-Why would he think that?
00:11:04.831,00:11:07.417,Nothing. It's good you think good things.
00:11:07.459,00:11:08.543,Come on.
00:11:08.585,00:11:10.003,Get in there.
00:11:10.044,00:11:12.130,"All right, big day tomorrow."
00:11:12.172,00:11:14.341,"Yeah, I know, first day."
00:11:14.382,00:11:16.050,"Yeah, for me, too."
00:11:16.092,00:11:17.427,"And I can't be late, all right?"
00:11:17.469,00:11:18.719,It's just me and you now.
00:11:18.761,00:11:19.720,I know.
00:11:19.762,00:11:22.723,Set your alarm and make sure I don't oversleep.
00:11:22.765,00:11:24.643,Good night.
00:11:24.683,00:11:26.394,All right.
00:11:26.436,00:11:28.313,"Here, I made you peanut butter and banana."
00:11:28.355,00:11:31.274,"-Thanks, Mom."
00:11:31.316,00:11:32.651,-And your keys?
00:11:32.691,00:11:33.943,You got your phone?
00:11:33.985,00:11:35.320,-Uh-huh.
00:11:35.362,00:11:36.695,"Yep, on the phone."
00:11:36.737,00:11:37.780,"Okay, what time do you get out?"
00:11:37.822,00:11:39.491,-2:45.
00:11:37.822,00:11:41.618,"-All right, I want you to come straight home, start your homework."
00:11:41.660,00:11:43.578,-And I'll be home a couple hours after that.
00:11:43.620,00:11:46.289,"Wait, Ma, you're not gonna pick me up or anything?"
00:11:46.331,00:11:47.666,I'm in the bus lane!
00:11:47.706,00:11:49.000,"I'm not gonna get another ticket, Oliver!"
00:11:49.042,00:11:50.627,"Bye, be good!"
00:12:25.662,00:12:27.997,"-Okay, settle down!"
00:12:28.039,00:12:30.500,Settle down! Settle down!
00:12:30.542,00:12:41.802,"I know it's hard to contain yourselves when you're so, so young and full of sugar juice, but we must concentrate on our studies or we will what?"
00:12:41.844,00:12:44.931,"Yes, we will, and dumbness does not play well in Heaven."
00:12:44.972,00:12:46.433,This is Oliver.
00:12:46.474,00:12:53.231,"Oliver is joining us midstream here at Saint Patrick, and we are very happy to have him, -are we not?"
00:12:51.145,00:12:55.108,"-Welcome to Saint Patrick, Oliver."
00:12:55.149,00:12:56.401,"Oh, whew."
00:12:56.443,00:12:58.152,Such genuine caring. Thank you.
00:12:58.194,00:12:59.320,I think you feel touched?
00:12:59.362,00:13:01.822,Right?
00:13:01.864,00:13:05.826,"Maybe as a thank-you, you can lead us all in morning prayer."
00:13:12.500,00:13:14.168,I think...
00:13:14.210,00:13:16.212,I think I'm Jewish.
00:13:16.254,00:13:18.047,Okay.
00:13:18.089,00:13:19.882,Good to know.
00:13:19.924,00:13:21.676,Oliver thinks he's Jewish.
00:13:21.718,00:13:23.136,GIRL: So am I.
00:13:23.177,00:13:25.639,-I'm Buddhist.
00:13:25.680,00:13:27.806,-Yes.
00:13:27.848,00:13:28.849,You get the idea.
00:13:28.891,00:13:32.019,"We celebrate all the religions of the world in this room, Oliver."
00:13:32.061,00:13:42.781,"I'm a Catholic, which is the best of all the religions, really, because we have the most rules and the best clothes, but among us there is also a Buddhist, an agnostic."
00:13:42.821,00:13:48.536,"We have a Baptist, and we have an I don't know, which seems to be the fastest growing religion in the world."
00:13:48.578,00:13:58.963,"And now we have I think I'm Jewish, which is a new one for the class, Oliver, so thanks for that, but it does not preclude you from giving us a morning prayer."
00:13:59.005,00:14:01.591,Let us bow our heads and pray.
00:14:02.801,00:14:04.927,Dear...
00:14:04.969,00:14:06.971,"God, et cetera."
00:14:09.349,00:14:13.728,"Dear-dear God, thank you?"
00:14:16.063,00:14:18.191,-Amen.
00:14:18.232,00:14:20.694,"-Amen! Amen, thanks be to God."
00:14:20.735,00:14:22.362,"All right, stirring stuff."
00:14:22.403,00:14:23.571,"Well done, Oliver."
00:14:23.613,00:14:25.323,Go grab yourself a seat.
00:14:25.365,00:14:29.076,And everybody else dust off those textbooks and go to chapter 12.
00:14:29.118,00:14:32.413,"That's chapter 12, Catholic saints."
00:14:47.387,00:14:50.139,"All right, I'm here."
00:14:50.181,00:14:52.642,"I'm here, I'm ready."
00:14:52.684,00:14:54.185,I'm able.
00:14:54.227,00:14:55.562,Let's get this.
00:14:55.603,00:14:56.896,Come on.
00:15:03.069,00:15:06.239,"ANNOUNCER: Look at that, it's Ground Pepper sprinting ahead on the inside!"
00:15:06.280,00:15:08.157,"Come on, dig in."
00:15:08.199,00:15:09.617,Come on.
00:15:11.703,00:15:13.204,Come on!
00:15:15.415,00:15:16.624,One time!
00:15:17.751,00:15:19.878,One damn time!
00:15:21.128,00:15:23.256,You son of a bitch!
00:15:26.050,00:15:30.054,"I don't know why you get so pissy, Vinny."
00:15:30.096,00:15:31.765,You always lose.
00:15:31.806,00:15:33.683,It seems like you'd be comfortable by now.
00:15:35.894,00:15:39.146,"Yeah, tough day."
00:15:43.610,00:15:46.487,Help yourself.
00:15:46.529,00:15:47.781,I'm thirsty.
00:15:47.822,00:15:49.908,"And you owe me money, Vin."
00:15:49.949,00:15:51.618,I got a situation I'm working out.
00:15:51.659,00:15:54.412,"You know, I'm not the sole proprietor here."
00:15:54.454,00:15:56.623,I've got other people to answer to.
00:15:56.664,00:15:58.165,"I just need a little time, that's all."
00:15:58.207,00:16:00.126,So what do I tell them?
00:16:00.167,00:16:02.253,A month.
00:16:04.297,00:16:06.507,We'll split the difference.
00:16:06.549,00:16:08.843,Make it two weeks.
00:16:24.233,00:16:26.694,-Beep-beep!
00:16:32.241,00:16:33.993,Watch out!
00:16:44.545,00:16:47.256,"-MAN: All right, how many?"
00:16:48.883,00:16:51.594,-And time!
00:16:51.636,00:16:53.888,You can let go now.
00:16:53.930,00:16:56.891,Did they have physical education in the last school you went to?
00:16:56.933,00:16:58.977,-Yes.
00:16:59.018,00:17:00.687,"Yes, sir."
00:17:06.442,00:17:08.068,Look who it is.
00:17:08.110,00:17:09.529,BOY: I think I'm Jewish.
00:17:09.570,00:17:11.071,"My name's Oliver, by the way."
00:17:12.323,00:17:13.825,My name's Oliver.
00:17:13.867,00:17:15.493,-You little turd.
00:17:15.535,00:17:17.662,"-Where'd you come from, anyway? Huh? Huh?"
00:17:17.704,00:17:19.372,Did you guys hear the bell?
00:17:19.413,00:17:21.541,"That means to move, go to class."
00:17:21.582,00:17:23.292,"Come on, let's go."
00:17:25.670,00:17:29.632,-Can't even do a sit-up.
00:17:29.674,00:17:31.342,"-No, sir."
00:17:29.674,00:17:33.594,"-Well, you better double-time it, or you're gonna be late. Let's go."
00:17:37.849,00:17:39.976,Shit.
00:17:55.909,00:17:57.869,Nice shorts.
00:19:33.047,00:19:34.757,Sir?
00:19:36.134,00:19:38.761,"Take me, God."
00:19:38.803,00:19:40.346,"It's me, sir."
00:19:42.932,00:19:45.225,"-Yeah, what?"
00:19:42.932,00:19:46.894,-I was wondering if I could use your phone?
00:19:46.936,00:19:49.022,-My phone?
00:19:50.023,00:19:52.025,-In my house?
00:19:52.066,00:19:59.115,"I need to call my mom-- I'm locked out of the house, 'cause these guys in gym class took my keys and my phone and I can't get in."
00:19:56.821,00:20:02.160,And they also -took my wallet.
00:20:02.201,00:20:05.163,-One call.
00:20:05.204,00:20:07.581,Can't take your call right now.
00:20:07.623,00:20:09.625,"-Oh, hey, Mom."
00:20:09.667,00:20:14.797,"I, uh, lost my keys for the house and my wallet and my phone, and I'm at the..."
00:20:14.839,00:20:17.257,old guy's next-door.
00:20:17.299,00:20:19.177,"Uh... Sir, what's your name?"
00:20:19.218,00:20:23.014,"-Vincent, the old guy."
00:20:25.265,00:20:27.267,The mean one.
00:20:48.998,00:20:51.125,What's your name?
00:20:51.167,00:20:53.169,"It's Oliver, sir."
00:20:53.211,00:20:57.131,They let you wear those shorts to school?
00:20:57.173,00:21:00.551,"Well, it's a long story, sir."
00:21:00.593,00:21:02.720,I'm sure it is.
00:21:14.982,00:21:16.525,Yeah?
00:21:16.567,00:21:20.279,"Hi. Uh, this is Maggie, Oliver's mom."
00:21:20.320,00:21:23.282,-Your kid's here.
00:21:23.323,00:21:24.408,I hope that's all right.
00:21:24.450,00:21:25.701,Is what all right?
00:21:25.743,00:21:28.913,-That he stays there.
00:21:28.955,00:21:30.456,"Like what, stays here?"
00:21:30.497,00:21:32.166,I'm at work.
00:21:30.497,00:21:36.254,"I-I've got three or four more cases, and I'm not gonna be home for a few hours, so I'm kind of in a jam here."
00:21:36.295,00:21:37.964,You want me to babysit?
00:21:38.005,00:21:41.592,"Well, it's not..."
00:21:41.634,00:21:44.428,"I mean, he's just probably gonna sit quietly and do his homework."
00:21:44.470,00:21:46.180,He's... he's really easy.
00:21:46.222,00:21:47.598,"Sir, is that..."
00:21:48.808,00:21:49.850,How much you paying?
00:21:49.892,00:21:50.893,What?
00:21:50.935,00:21:52.270,You want me to babysit.
00:21:52.311,00:21:54.563,I'm not a philanthropy.
00:21:54.605,00:21:56.857,I don't...
00:21:56.899,00:21:58.442,-Twelve.
00:21:58.484,00:22:00.069,Okay.
00:22:00.111,00:22:02.613,$12 an hour.
00:22:02.655,00:22:04.406,-It's for you.
00:22:06.951,00:22:09.120,"...I said, sit up!"
00:22:09.162,00:22:11.038,-Up!
00:22:12.665,00:22:14.208,He doesn't like many people.
00:22:14.250,00:22:16.836,"I'm good with animals, sir."
00:22:16.877,00:22:18.129,Yeah.
00:22:18.171,00:22:20.798,He doesn't usually like people who say they're good with animals.
00:22:22.842,00:22:25.052,"-Okay, pal..."
00:22:27.096,00:22:28.597,You never seen Abbott and Costello?
00:22:28.639,00:22:29.640,"No, sir."
00:22:29.682,00:22:30.891,Are they old?
00:22:30.933,00:22:32.226,No.
00:22:32.268,00:22:34.061,They're dead.
00:22:34.103,00:22:36.563,That's the oldest you can be.
00:22:36.605,00:22:38.858,Or the youngest.
00:22:38.899,00:22:41.861,Where'd you learn that?
00:22:41.902,00:22:43.112,A book.
00:22:43.154,00:22:44.697,What book?
00:22:44.738,00:22:46.240,"A kids book, sir."
00:22:46.282,00:22:47.950,I doubt you'd know it.
00:22:48.951,00:22:51.245,It's dinnertime.
00:22:52.246,00:22:54.165,You hungry or something?
00:22:54.207,00:22:56.209,"A little, sir."
00:22:56.250,00:22:58.376,That figures.
00:22:59.712,00:23:02.965,"Excuse me, I'll be right back."
00:23:26.572,00:23:29.075,You're getting sushi.
00:23:32.328,00:23:33.954,"You see, your troubles are all over."
00:23:40.002,00:23:42.546,-That's probably your mother.
00:23:42.588,00:23:44.590,"-Probably, sir."
00:23:44.631,00:23:46.508,-Don't get up.
00:23:47.593,00:23:49.095,Hi. I...
00:23:51.013,00:23:53.640,-Hi. Vincent?
00:23:53.682,00:23:55.851,"Maggie. I, uh..."
00:23:55.893,00:23:57.770,Thank you for watching him.
00:23:57.811,00:24:01.190,"You know, with the new job and... my boss, you know..."
00:24:01.232,00:24:03.734,-I don't need to hear the whole story.
00:24:03.776,00:24:07.071,"Um, oh. Here."
00:24:08.488,00:24:10.616,What'd we say?
00:24:10.657,00:24:13.119,...that three hours at... at $12...
00:24:13.160,00:24:15.704,-$36.
00:24:15.746,00:24:17.415,"Um, I've got two twenties."
00:24:17.455,00:24:18.999,I don't have change.
00:24:19.041,00:24:20.751,-That's fine.
00:24:20.793,00:24:24.004,How come you don't have anyone to watch this kid after school?
00:24:24.046,00:24:25.172,We just moved in.
00:24:25.214,00:24:26.506,Where's the father?
00:24:26.548,00:24:28.968,"We met in college, and it turns out that..."
00:24:29.009,00:24:32.263,-he had been seeing someone...
00:24:32.305,00:24:34.056,You gonna pay for my fence?
00:24:34.098,00:24:37.851,"Yeah, I-I... yes, -I said I was going to."
00:24:37.893,00:24:41.063,I'm not sure how...
00:24:41.105,00:24:44.524,"Everything has a price-- you're an adult, you should know that."
00:24:44.566,00:24:47.445,All right. Let me know.
00:24:47.485,00:24:50.114,"I can watch the kid after school, a few hours."
00:24:50.156,00:24:52.616,-Same price.
00:24:52.658,00:24:56.120,"I can do $11 an hour, you pay the snacks."
00:24:56.162,00:24:58.872,Your kid ate my last can of sardines.
00:24:58.914,00:25:00.416,Really?
00:25:00.458,00:25:02.460,Smell his breath.
00:25:02.500,00:25:04.086,They have those options...
00:25:06.130,00:25:08.174,I thought you ate at Vincent's house.
00:25:08.215,00:25:09.467,We had sushi.
00:25:09.507,00:25:10.759,You had sushi?
00:25:10.801,00:25:12.470,"Well, sardines."
00:25:12.510,00:25:13.971,Didn't want to hurt his feelings.
00:25:14.013,00:25:15.348,"So, you like him?"
00:25:16.390,00:25:18.434,"Well, he's interesting."
00:25:18.476,00:25:21.479,"Sort of cool, in a grouchy sort of way."
00:25:21.519,00:25:23.439,"Yeah, I'll bet he is."
00:25:24.648,00:25:27.151,"He has a cool cat, though-- Felix."
00:25:27.193,00:25:29.278,"You know, he, um..."
00:25:29.320,00:25:32.323,offered to watch you after school.
00:25:32.365,00:25:34.908,-He did?
00:25:35.909,00:25:37.577,Well...
00:25:37.619,00:25:40.414,he lives right next-door-- you can't get closer than that.
00:25:40.456,00:25:43.000,"Yeah, I-I had thought about that."
00:25:43.042,00:25:46.003,"You know, it would..."
00:25:43.042,00:25:48.839,save me from having to find a babysitter.
00:25:48.881,00:25:50.716,"You'll be home, though, right?"
00:25:50.757,00:25:52.592,"Yeah, I'm gonna come home, but sometimes late."
00:25:52.634,00:25:55.179,"You know, I-I'm the one that has to work now."
00:25:55.221,00:25:56.389,Your father's not helping.
00:25:56.430,00:25:58.432,I don't know if he ever is going to.
00:25:58.474,00:25:59.933,And your school's not exactly cheap.
00:25:59.975,00:26:05.563,"I guess he's too old to be dangerous, and not too old to be too dangerous, either."
00:26:05.605,00:26:07.607,If you know what I mean.
00:26:34.093,00:26:35.635,Stupid place.
00:26:35.677,00:26:37.595,Who pissed in your Cheerios?
00:26:37.637,00:26:40.224,dance no more.
00:26:40.266,00:26:41.683,"Oh, that's a surprise."
00:26:41.725,00:26:44.103,"We need the money, Vin!"
00:26:44.144,00:26:47.147,The quality of mercy is suddenly strained.
00:26:47.189,00:26:49.649,I should sue these assholes!
00:26:49.691,00:26:51.026,What's the word?
00:26:51.068,00:26:53.571,Discrimination against pregnant woman! Yes?
00:26:53.611,00:26:56.532,I think you got a real good case.
00:26:56.574,00:26:58.284,This stupid bump is costing me much money.
00:26:58.325,00:27:00.702,"Well, he's gonna cost you a lot more pretty soon."
00:27:00.744,00:27:01.828,It's not he.
00:27:01.870,00:27:04.331,It's a she?
00:27:04.373,00:27:06.208,How I know this?
00:27:06.250,00:27:08.127,I look like psychic to you?
00:27:08.168,00:27:10.712,"No, you don't."
00:27:10.754,00:27:12.172,"Yeah, I know what they have."
00:27:12.214,00:27:17.928,I call stripper employer and ask them to fax insurance card to pay ultrasound.
00:27:20.055,00:27:22.724,"-TEACHER: So, the question I suppose is..."
00:27:22.766,00:27:25.436,...what is a saint?
00:27:25.478,00:27:27.146,Does anybody know what a saint is?
00:27:27.187,00:27:28.772,I don't think they do. Ooh.
00:27:28.814,00:27:30.774,-Rachel.
00:27:28.814,00:27:33.569,-Individuals who display and act out of exceptional holiness.
00:27:33.611,00:27:35.321,That's pretty perfect.
00:27:35.362,00:27:37.114,Who can name a saint?
00:27:37.156,00:27:39.158,-Jeremiah.
00:27:39.199,00:27:41.368,"Saint Jude, yes. And what is Saint Jude known for?"
00:27:41.410,00:27:44.288,"Um, I think he owns a hospital, right?"
00:27:44.330,00:27:46.081,"-And a golf tournament, right?"
00:27:46.123,00:27:47.541,That's what...
00:27:47.583,00:27:50.294,Uh... anyone know any modern-day saints?
00:27:50.336,00:27:51.669,Bridgette.
00:27:51.711,00:27:53.005,Mother Teresa.
00:27:53.046,00:27:54.214,"Mother Teresa, yes."
00:27:54.256,00:27:56.091,The big MT is a modern-day saint.
00:27:56.133,00:28:13.192,"So, a saint is a human being we celebrate for their commitment and dedication to other human beings, for the sacrifices that they make, for their hard work in making the world a better place for those around us and for those who will follow them."
00:28:16.195,00:28:17.863,Good night.

00:28:28.706,00:28:31.502,"Ah, sorry, can't let you clock out without the shift being covered."
00:28:31.544,00:28:32.710,Hospital policy.
00:28:32.752,00:28:34.921,Oh.
00:28:44.931,00:28:47.685,"Come on, coward, try to sell me something."
00:28:49.395,00:28:51.897,Sh...

00:29:11.833,00:29:17.464,"VINCENT: I'm gonna listen to your whole goddamn spiel, and then I'm gonna hang up."
00:29:17.506,00:29:20.800,"-Vincent, it's Maggie."
00:29:20.842,00:29:25.013,"Wait, is it Maggie from Calcutta, -or is it Maggie from New Delhi?"
00:29:22.636,00:29:26.724,"-No, it's your neighbor, Maggie."
00:29:26.765,00:29:29.643,What the hell do you want?
00:29:39.111,00:29:40.529,Let's go!

00:43:25.937,00:43:28.064,He's got to learn how to defend himself.
00:43:28.106,00:43:31.276,-Fighting is for assholes.
00:43:32.735,00:43:34.820,Where's my money?
00:43:34.862,00:43:37.115,It's on the dresser.
00:43:37.156,00:43:40.243,-Yah!
00:43:40.285,00:43:42.370,-Hi-yah!
00:43:42.412,00:43:43.788,Yah!
00:43:45.415,00:43:46.999,Look at you.
00:43:52.630,00:43:54.549,Breaking his nose!
00:43:56.134,00:43:58.303,Who is she?
00:43:59.429,00:44:01.722,A lady of the night.
00:44:01.764,00:44:03.891,What's that?
00:44:03.933,00:44:10.440,"It's, uh, one of the more honest ways to make a living."
00:44:20.158,00:44:26.623,"VINCENT: The board tells you the action for the day, race number, who's running, who's riding, and so forth."
00:44:26.664,00:44:28.374,What's 20-slash-one?
00:44:28.416,00:44:29.959,That's odds.
00:44:30.001,00:44:34.046,Some bookie out of Vegas thinks that that horse has a one-in-20 chance of winning.
00:44:34.088,00:44:35.465,What do you get if he does?
00:44:35.507,00:44:36.924,20 times your money.
00:44:36.966,00:44:38.384,That's a good deal.
00:44:38.426,00:44:40.261,"If you win, sure."
00:44:42.639,00:44:44.932,VINCENT: That one with the wraps is a dog.
00:44:44.974,00:44:46.767,OLIVER: Doesn't sound like a compliment.
00:44:46.809,00:44:50.271,"Not for a horse. No, the odds of him winning are astronomical."
00:44:50.313,00:44:52.064,"Long odds, bigger payout."
00:44:52.106,00:44:54.733,We should take him across the board.
00:44:56.068,00:44:58.821,"Well, don't get ahead of yourself, kid."
00:45:05.244,00:45:08.164,-Are you praying?
00:45:08.206,00:45:09.999,-That's what it looks like.
00:45:08.206,00:45:11.543,-I thought we talked about you not talking.
00:45:11.584,00:45:13.461,What's a trifecta?
00:45:17.340,00:45:24.639,"Uh, you pick, uh, three horses one, two, three, in the order they finish, and it's a high risk, high reward."
00:45:24.681,00:45:26.807,Sounds improbable.
00:45:26.849,00:45:31.896,"Well, if you're gonna gamble, you might as well have a chance to win big."
00:45:31.937,00:45:36.401,"Uh, Harvey Knows Best, Sweeter Lady, Champagne Flute."
00:45:36.442,00:45:38.277,"One, two, three."
00:45:38.319,00:45:41.030,800 to one.
00:45:41.072,00:45:42.948,You got any money?
00:45:42.990,00:45:45.034,Sure.
00:45:46.994,00:45:49.872,Uh... seven dollars.
00:45:49.914,00:45:51.583,"What is that, lunch money?"
00:45:51.624,00:45:53.668,"-Yes, sir."
00:45:51.624,00:45:55.002,"-Well, you might as well learn the hard way."
00:45:55.044,00:45:57.714,"Uh... I'll throw in some, too."
00:45:57.754,00:46:00.757,That's called mitigation.
00:46:00.799,00:46:02.677,What's... mitigation?
00:46:02.719,00:46:06.514,That's where you throw in seven and I throw in three.
00:46:10.727,00:46:12.895,ANNOUNCER: And they're off!
00:46:12.937,00:46:16.023,Sweeter Lady takes the lead by a length and a half...
00:46:16.065,00:46:18.234,Come on. Come on.
00:46:18.276,00:46:19.902,...and here comes Harvey Knows Best!
00:46:21.404,00:46:26.158,Harvey Knows Best making a final surge as they come around for the line!
00:46:26.200,00:46:27.535,This is ridiculous!
00:46:29.036,00:46:30.996,This is really happening!
00:46:31.038,00:46:33.040,VINCENT: Don't stop!
00:46:33.082,00:46:35.460,Don't stop! Don't stop!
00:46:35.501,00:46:36.877,This is ridiculous!
00:46:36.919,00:46:38.296,-Yeah! Yeah!
00:46:38.337,00:46:39.880,-Go! Go!
00:46:39.922,00:46:42.759,VINCENT: Don't stop!
00:46:42.799,00:46:48.681,-ANNOUNCER: And it will be Harvey Knows Best followed by Sweeter Lady and Champagne Flute.
00:46:48.723,00:46:51.726,-This isn't fair! It's not...
00:46:51.768,00:46:53.227,-fair!
00:46:53.269,00:46:55.271,"Just roll with this, just roll with this, man."
00:46:55.313,00:46:59.275,"Just roll with this, and act like -you didn't win it."
00:46:59.317,00:47:01.402,"VINCENT: No, no, it didn't work for us."
00:47:01.444,00:47:04.614,Do you understand me?
00:47:04.656,00:47:06.532,"Yeah, but we didn't..."
00:47:06.574,00:47:08.409,"We didn't win anything, okay?"
00:47:10.536,00:47:13.038,Thank you.
00:47:57.166,00:47:59.084,Good afternoon...
00:47:59.126,00:48:01.629,-Mr. MacKenna.
00:47:59.126,00:48:03.506,-I need to open up a savings account for my grandson.
00:48:03.548,00:48:07.677,-Oh.
00:48:07.719,00:48:10.054,Close me out while you're tapping away over there.
00:48:10.095,00:48:13.474,"Don't ever become a pencil pusher, kid."
00:48:13.516,00:48:15.643,They're spineless.
00:48:53.598,00:48:55.850,"Hello, Mrs. Bronstein."
00:48:55.892,00:49:00.730,"This is, uh, Dan O'Brien, principal here at Saint Patrick."
00:49:00.772,00:49:07.653,"Uh... a-a few days ago, your son Oliver was involved in a fight at school."
00:49:07.695,00:49:09.530,-We've tried to reach you...
00:49:09.572,00:49:10.531,What?
00:49:12.366,00:49:17.079,"If you're a telemarketer, please leave a message so I can not return your call."
00:49:18.247,00:49:20.040,MAGGIE: Vin.
00:49:20.082,00:49:21.958,Vin? Oliver?
00:49:22.000,00:49:24.961,"Oliver, it's Mom. Pick up."
00:49:25.003,00:49:27.632,Hello?
00:49:30.635,00:49:32.595,You want another?
00:49:32.637,00:49:34.388,"Yes, please."
00:49:34.430,00:49:36.724,Go for it.
00:49:38.434,00:49:39.936,"excuse me, sir?"
00:49:41.646,00:49:43.564,Damn small talkers.
00:49:43.606,00:49:46.358,There's no point in yapping if no one's listening.
00:49:46.400,00:49:50.655,-Let's hear it.
00:49:50.696,00:49:55.117,VINCENT: You can't get nothing in this world -without being heard.
00:49:55.159,00:49:56.869,"Another Coke, please."
00:49:56.911,00:49:58.496,"And you can hit me, too, Rog."
00:49:58.537,00:50:00.122,We're out of your bourbon.
00:50:00.164,00:50:01.916,You cleaned me out.
00:50:03.083,00:50:05.795,Rog... don't lie to me.
00:50:05.837,00:50:07.588,Be a man.
00:50:07.630,00:50:10.800,Vin. And he's not supposed to be sitting at the bar.
00:50:10.842,00:50:12.343,You're right.
00:50:10.842,00:50:13.928,We're gonna go somewhere else to spend our money.
00:50:13.970,00:50:16.889,"MAN: Hey, he's only doing his job there, Vin."
00:50:16.931,00:50:18.349,Be nice.
00:50:19.600,00:50:20.810,-Oh!
00:50:22.561,00:50:25.857,"Amber, -get the first-aid kit."
00:50:25.898,00:50:28.192,But it's just a cut.
00:50:28.233,00:50:30.152,"Here, here."
00:50:30.194,00:50:32.613,"Man, you're bleeding all over the bar."
00:50:32.655,00:50:35.115,That's fine.
00:50:35.157,00:50:37.284,"Come on, let's go."
00:51:01.851,00:51:04.020,"-Hi, Mom."
00:51:04.060,00:51:05.771,"Where the hell is your car, Vin?"
00:51:05.813,00:51:07.815,-OLIVER: It broke down.
00:51:07.857,00:51:09.734,"Oh, it broke down? Really?"
00:51:09.775,00:51:13.863,I don't appreciate you taking him anywhere without asking me.
00:51:13.905,00:51:15.865,"Oh, this is gonna be fun."
00:51:15.907,00:51:18.617,"Could you not be a smart-ass, just for once? Okay?"
00:51:18.659,00:51:21.954,"I want to know where my son is at all times, okay?"
00:51:21.996,00:51:25.123,-We just went to... eat.
00:51:25.165,00:51:26.792,"Go in the house, Oliver."
00:51:26.834,00:51:29.712,-M...
00:51:29.754,00:51:31.505,"Good night, Vin."
00:51:31.547,00:51:33.674,"Yeah, we'll see about that."
00:51:33.716,00:51:35.885,"You know, he's getting in fights at school."
00:51:35.927,00:51:37.386,Did you know that?
00:51:37.428,00:51:39.013,"Yeah, he mentioned something like that."
00:51:39.055,00:51:41.057,"Yeah? Well, he didn't mention anything to me about it."
00:51:41.097,00:51:47.939,"Oh, well, maybe you haven't noticed, but, uh, you haven't been home much-- it's kind of difficult to have a conversation with someone that's not here."
00:51:47.980,00:51:49.273,"Oh, we're gonna do that?"
00:51:49.314,00:51:54.110,"God, I love when somebody like you tells somebody like me advice, especially on parenting."
00:51:54.152,00:51:58.198,"I didn't sign on for the hormones, dearie, so that's gonna cost you 15 bucks an hour."
00:51:58.240,00:51:59.825,You know why you never had kids?
00:51:59.867,00:52:03.454,Because you don't want to think about anybody other than yourself.
00:52:03.495,00:52:06.540,"What do you know about me, really?"
00:52:06.582,00:52:09.085,Tell me. I'd love it.
00:52:09.125,00:52:16.675,"Nothing. I don't know a thing about you, just the way you want it-- then you can act like a prick and it keeps everybody away."
00:52:16.717,00:52:18.928,If it ain't broken...
00:52:18.970,00:52:21.137,"It is broken, Vin-- take a look at it."
00:52:21.179,00:52:23.641,"All right, I'm at 40 hours for this week."
00:52:23.682,00:52:26.102,"At 41, I go to time and a half."
00:52:28.144,00:52:30.272,"Excuse me, is someone gonna pay me?"
00:52:32.900,00:52:35.903,You've got to be kidding me.
00:52:37.905,00:52:40.032,I can't even say these words.
00:52:40.074,00:52:41.700,They're creative.
00:52:41.742,00:52:42.994,Yes.
00:52:43.035,00:52:44.954,"Yeah, that-that's one way to put it."
00:52:47.163,00:52:51.627,"adjusting, uh, to a, to a new school -is tough on children at this age."
00:52:51.669,00:52:54.338,"At any age, really, and I don't want to minimize that."
00:52:54.379,00:53:00.302,"But is there anything else, uh, going on that we should be aware of?"
00:53:00.344,00:53:05.390,"Oh, I wouldn't even know How-how about his father?"
00:53:05.432,00:53:09.687,"Well, I don't want to take up We have loads of time."
00:53:12.815,00:53:15.359,We're in the middle of a divorce.
00:53:15.400,00:53:25.744,"Oliver's father, uh, was having an affair with his assistant, and our accountant, and my hairdresser while she was still doing my hair, so that was fun."
00:53:25.786,00:53:30.124,"And now he's filed for custody of Oliver, full custody."
00:53:30.166,00:53:32.668,And he won't pay any support until he gets what he wants.
00:53:32.710,00:53:34.045,"Plus, he's a lawyer."
00:53:34.086,00:53:35.504,-Shit.
00:53:34.086,00:53:41.052,"-So I just had to get out of there as fast as I could, and I took Oliver with me, and I got a job at Mission Hills."
00:53:41.093,00:53:43.054,I'm a CAT scan tech.
00:53:43.095,00:53:45.263,So I just see...
00:53:45.305,00:53:47.558,really rough stuff all day.
00:53:47.599,00:53:57.943,"You know, cancer and tumors and cysts and clots, and I see what I'm looking at, but I can't tell, you know, the people that are laying there, so that's..."
00:53:57.985,00:53:59.403,miserable all day.
00:53:59.444,00:54:05.617,"And I work really late, because I'm trying to get our act together."
00:54:07.243,00:54:12.332,"That's why he's here, so he can have a good education, and I'm trying to..."
00:54:12.374,00:54:17.963,"just give him a semi-normal life, and I'm dealing with this shit from David and..."
00:54:18.005,00:54:19.965,custody.
00:54:20.007,00:54:22.134,I'm sorry about swearing.
00:54:24.095,00:54:27.098,I know he didn't even want kids.
00:54:27.139,00:54:28.724,He didn't want them.
00:54:28.766,00:54:31.351,He's just doing this so I'm not happy.
00:54:31.393,00:54:33.104,You know Oliver's adopted.
00:54:33.145,00:54:34.521,-Did you know that?
00:54:34.563,00:54:36.565,"I don't know how you would, but he is."
00:54:38.692,00:54:40.236,I cannot have...
00:54:40.276,00:54:41.946,kids.
00:54:41.987,00:54:44.990,"You know, something about my fallopian tubes being twisted."
00:54:45.032,00:54:49.536,"I think, what I really think, is that they were just recoiling from David's sperm."
00:54:50.955,00:54:52.414,Can I...
00:54:52.456,00:54:54.374,Can I just have one?
00:54:54.416,00:54:56.710,-Thank you. Thank you for that.
00:54:56.752,00:55:04.760,"So, um, I just think that all of this has kind of permeated, you know, Oliver's whole little being, right?"
00:55:04.802,00:55:06.220,"I mean, it has to."
00:55:06.262,00:55:09.140,"He's like a little, like a little sponge."
00:55:09.181,00:55:11.267,OCINSKI: My real name's Robert.
00:55:11.307,00:55:13.102,Ocinski's my last name.
00:55:13.144,00:55:16.855,People call me that ever since Geraghty called me that last year.
00:55:16.897,00:55:19.775,Now everyone calls me that.
00:55:19.817,00:55:24.571,"It's not like I can go around and tell them, Hey, dickwad, don't call me Ocinski."
00:55:24.613,00:55:26.406,My name's Robert.
00:55:26.448,00:55:29.409,'Cause I would spend my whole life doing that.
00:55:29.451,00:55:31.078,You taking a wiz?
00:55:31.120,00:55:33.122,"Sorry, can't hold it."
00:55:33.164,00:55:35.499,Robert was my dad's name.
00:55:35.540,00:55:37.751,-So I'm a junior.
00:55:37.793,00:55:39.461,"He's not around, though."
00:55:39.503,00:55:42.965,"I don't really know him, 'cause he left when I was a baby."
00:55:43.007,00:55:45.843,"Yeah, my dad's not around, either."
00:55:45.884,00:55:50.264,"He did some bad things to my mom, so we left him."
00:55:48.179,00:55:52.057,Haven't seen him in a while.
00:55:52.099,00:55:54.643,"I kind of miss him, though."
00:55:54.685,00:55:57.104,My mom's being a jerk.
00:55:57.146,00:55:59.315,"They do that, man."
00:56:12.619,00:56:16.581,"Hey, uh, your dad the one that taught you how to fight?"
00:56:16.623,00:56:18.750,"No, my babysitter."
00:56:19.960,00:56:22.880,"Tide comes in twice a day, Doctor."
00:56:22.921,00:56:25.549,"Yeah, that's the tide."
00:56:25.590,00:56:28.677,Comes and goes.
00:56:28.719,00:56:30.679,-I can't wait for autumn.
00:56:30.721,00:56:33.891,They plant the most beautiful mums all around the water.
00:56:33.932,00:56:35.100,Yeah?
00:56:35.142,00:56:36.476,Every color you can imagine.
00:56:36.518,00:56:39.604,I don't know where they get them all.
00:56:40.814,00:56:42.607,At the garden store.
00:56:45.277,00:56:47.821,"You've always been so funny, Vin."
00:56:48.947,00:56:50.908,Vin?
00:56:50.949,00:56:53.409,"Vin, it's Vin, Sandy."
00:56:58.456,00:56:59.666,"The ducks eat them, though."
00:57:01.543,00:57:03.461,We have to shoo them away.
00:57:03.503,00:57:06.673,It's such a shame.
00:57:07.799,00:57:09.927,It's a shame.
00:57:15.557,00:57:19.228,"There's plenty of affordable health care options, Vin."
00:57:19.270,00:57:21.063,I'm sure you know that.
00:57:21.105,00:57:22.314,Sunnyside is pricey.
00:57:22.356,00:57:24.858,Not for everyone.
00:57:24.900,00:57:28.486,"Well, my Sandy gets the best."
00:57:28.528,00:57:31.031,"I just, I'll just have to figure it out."
00:57:31.073,00:57:35.119,"I understand that, but you're months behind, and we are not in the credit business, as you know."
00:57:35.160,00:57:36.995,What's that mean?
00:57:37.037,00:57:41.499,We need payment in full and three months in advance.
00:57:41.541,00:57:42.751,Got it.
00:57:42.793,00:57:44.002,By next week.
00:57:44.044,00:57:45.587,Next week?
00:57:45.629,00:57:47.672,"Yeah, next week."
00:57:49.300,00:57:52.677,"Well, I can give you 20 percent..."
00:57:52.719,00:57:54.930,in good faith?
00:57:54.972,00:57:56.140,"Vin, we're past good faith."
00:57:56.181,00:57:58.100,I'm sorry.
00:57:58.142,00:58:01.437,We will transfer Sandy wherever you want to put her.
00:58:01.478,00:58:03.397,Put her?
00:58:03.439,00:58:04.564,That's it?
00:58:04.606,00:58:06.400,Or we get the boot?
00:58:06.442,00:58:09.403,I don't think that's the best way to phrase what's happening.
00:58:09.445,00:58:12.948,"Okay, what's the best way to phrase it?"
00:58:12.990,00:58:15.575,It is what it is.
00:58:17.953,00:58:20.664,"Let's get some new plants, uh, for the room, okay?"
00:58:20.705,00:58:23.167,I can have the desk order something.
00:58:23.208,00:58:25.919,"Well, I was hoping maybe for mums."
00:58:25.961,00:58:27.879,Sure.
00:58:27.921,00:58:30.548,"And, um, here's a little something for your trouble."
00:58:30.590,00:58:32.343,"Oh, no."
00:58:32.384,00:58:33.551,I take care of people. Please.
00:58:33.593,00:58:35.179,"You go way beyond your job, Ana."
00:58:36.972,00:58:38.140,You've been an angel to my Sandy.
00:58:38.182,00:58:40.100,"Okay, Vin."
00:58:40.142,00:58:41.643,"We don't make a habit now, okay?"
00:58:41.685,00:58:44.104,"It can't happen, I'm shit broke."
00:58:46.190,00:58:47.483,You got a nice smile.
00:58:47.524,00:58:49.234,You should do it more often.
00:58:49.276,00:58:50.527,I'll get the laundry.
00:59:07.252,00:59:08.586,There you go.
00:59:11.256,00:59:13.300,It's a lot lighter.
00:59:13.342,00:59:16.261,She didn't change much this week.
00:59:16.303,00:59:20.724,"Well, easy on my back."
00:59:20.765,00:59:22.309,Thanks.
00:59:22.351,00:59:25.479,"Behave yourself, Vin."
00:59:36.614,00:59:38.325,He'll pay hundred dollars.
00:59:38.367,00:59:41.370,$100? I pay more than that for one prescription.
00:59:41.412,00:59:48.877,"He said this is for epilepsy, for prostate flaring, and to soften the shitting."
00:59:48.919,00:59:50.795,That should have some value.
00:59:50.837,00:59:52.672,For who? You?
00:59:52.714,00:59:54.007,Eh.
00:59:54.049,00:59:55.842,We need the... I need the dough.
00:59:55.884,00:59:57.844,I... 500 bucks!
00:59:57.886,01:00:00.138,This is all high-dollar shit.
01:00:00.180,01:00:02.057,"He said 100, Vin."
01:00:02.099,01:00:03.225,You take it or leave this.
01:00:03.267,01:00:05.394,You can't sell this to get high.
01:00:07.563,01:00:09.940,I'll take a hundred.
01:00:11.775,01:00:13.569,"Oh, you'll take a hundred?"
01:00:13.610,01:00:15.653,Stupid...
01:00:30.668,01:00:32.504,Hello there.
01:00:32.546,01:00:33.797,"Your account's closed, Mr. MacKenna."
01:00:33.838,01:00:35.382,"Yeah, I know that."
01:00:35.424,01:00:37.426,"Uh, this withdraw is on my grandson's account."
01:00:37.468,01:00:38.969,I think I'm on it.
01:00:40.512,01:00:42.389,"How much, sir?"
01:00:42.431,01:00:44.391,What's the balance?
01:00:46.226,01:00:49.854,"$2,700."
01:00:53.191,01:00:55.902,I'll take all that.
01:00:55.944,01:00:57.488,How would you like that?
01:00:57.529,01:00:59.573,"Hundreds, please."
01:01:05.287,01:01:06.455,"It's $2,700, Larry."
01:01:06.497,01:01:10.041,"I want a $450 trifecta box in the third, okay?"
01:01:10.083,01:01:14.463,"I want one, two, three, Lucky Lincoln, New Dime, Sammy's Savior."
01:01:16.089,01:01:17.924,"LARRY: Thank you, sir."
01:01:17.966,01:01:19.510,This is gonna make it all better.
01:01:19.551,01:01:22.471,Okay.
01:01:22.513,01:01:30.646,"New Dime drops back to sixth, while back on the rail, Lucky Lincoln trails well behind, five lengths behind the rest of the pack."
01:01:50.707,01:01:52.750,"You all right, hon?"
01:01:54.127,01:01:56.254,"No, I'm not."
01:02:55.564,01:02:59.943,"You must think I'm not a very serious person, Vinny."
01:02:59.984,01:03:01.612,You have no right to be here.
01:03:01.653,01:03:03.071,You find anything good?
01:03:03.113,01:03:04.864,"No, some old jewelry."
01:03:04.906,01:03:06.783,Not worth much.
01:03:06.824,01:03:09.745,"That's my wife's, you son of a bitch."
01:03:09.786,01:03:11.747,You owe me money.
01:03:14.249,01:03:16.585,"Come on, Vinny!"
01:03:16.627,01:03:19.921,Why do you always have to do things the hard way?
01:03:19.963,01:03:21.632,It's more interesting.
01:03:21.673,01:03:23.341,And a lot more painful.
01:03:23.383,01:03:26.010,All right.
01:03:26.052,01:03:27.220,Let's do.
01:03:27.262,01:03:29.139,Son of a bitch is crazy.
01:03:29.180,01:03:33.393,"Don't kill him, but bring him close to it."
01:03:35.061,01:03:36.354,What the... Oh!
01:03:38.565,01:03:41.901,"What are you doing, old man?"
01:03:41.943,01:03:43.903,"He's dying, dude."
01:03:43.945,01:03:45.155,"No, he's not."
01:03:45.196,01:03:47.240,He's...
01:03:53.538,01:03:55.373,Don't touch nothing.
01:03:55.415,01:03:56.958,Let's just go.
01:03:57.000,01:03:59.002,Let's just go.
01:04:40.585,01:04:42.629,Vin?
01:04:43.797,01:04:45.841,Vin?
01:04:50.136,01:04:51.638,"Vin, it's Maggie."
01:04:51.680,01:04:56.017,"We're gonna put you in this machine, and we're gonna take some tests, and it's not gonna hurt a bit."
01:04:56.059,01:04:58.186,"NURSE: He can't understand you, Maggie."
01:05:01.189,01:05:03.316,"Okay, there he is."
01:05:03.358,01:05:04.901,It's just gonna be a couple minutes.
01:05:27.549,01:05:29.843,"Hey, there's my brave little man."
01:05:29.885,01:05:31.469,Is he okay?
01:05:31.511,01:05:33.179,I thought he was dead.
01:05:33.221,01:05:35.139,He was just lying there.
01:05:35.181,01:05:37.517,"Yeah, that's what it looks like."
01:05:37.559,01:05:40.228,"Well, he looks like that when he's drunk, too, so..."
01:05:40.270,01:05:42.939,I don't even know what you're doing anymore.
01:05:42.980,01:05:44.608,I know what I'm doing.
01:05:44.649,01:05:46.777,And your father's gonna have a field day with this.
01:05:46.818,01:05:50.614,"I-I wouldn't be here instead of with you -if it wasn't for him, yet I'm gonna get..."
01:05:50.655,01:05:51.782,We're doing good.
01:05:51.823,01:05:55.076,"You're working hard every day, and we need the money."
01:05:55.118,01:05:56.620,It's all right.
01:05:56.661,01:05:58.663,Okay.
01:06:00.916,01:06:03.000,"What's wrong with him, anyway?"
01:06:04.210,01:06:06.630,Uh...
01:06:06.671,01:06:08.465,they think he's had a stroke.
01:06:11.259,01:06:12.761,Slowly.
01:06:12.803,01:06:15.388,"Down, down, down, down, down."
01:06:15.430,01:06:17.098,"Good, good, bend the knees."
01:06:17.140,01:06:18.850,Flat back.
01:06:18.892,01:06:20.644,"Good, good."
01:06:20.685,01:06:22.353,Bend the knees.
01:06:22.395,01:06:24.522,"-All right, all right, good."
01:06:24.564,01:06:29.319,"Saint William of Rochester, the patron saint of adopted children."
01:06:29.360,01:06:31.195,It's a pretty interesting story.
01:06:31.237,01:06:33.740,All the other saints I looked at were all so...
01:06:33.782,01:06:35.867,"saintly, I guess."
01:06:35.909,01:06:37.911,"Uh, what does saintly mean to you?"
01:06:37.953,01:06:39.454,I don't know.
01:06:39.496,01:06:41.998,I don't really believe in saints and all that.
01:06:42.039,01:06:47.796,I feel like Saint William just got to be a saint 'cause he was killed by the boy he adopted.
01:06:47.838,01:06:52.676,"These days, people get killed all the time, and they don't get to be a saint for it."
01:06:52.717,01:06:54.886,"All right, well, thanks, Oliver."
01:06:57.054,01:07:03.311,"Despite young Oliver's reticence, I do happen to believe that there are saints all around us today."
01:07:03.353,01:07:10.318,"They may never be considered as such by religion, but they are just as important as the ones in your textbooks."
01:07:10.360,01:07:18.869,"Thus, you are going to research someone you know, or know of, and determine if they have the qualities fit for sainthood."
01:07:21.705,01:07:23.414,Where is he?
01:07:23.456,01:07:24.457,His car is here.
01:07:24.499,01:07:25.959,He's in the hospital.
01:07:26.001,01:07:28.085,For what?
01:07:28.127,01:07:30.421,"MAGGIE: So, how-how do you and Vincent know each other?"
01:07:31.589,01:07:33.466,I'm working for this man.
01:07:33.508,01:07:35.552,"Oh, doing what?"
01:07:36.678,01:07:38.638,Working.
01:07:38.680,01:07:40.724,I'm also dancer.
01:07:42.684,01:07:45.770,"Wow, that... sounds exciting."
01:07:47.438,01:07:49.900,Try to sound it out.
01:07:52.109,01:07:54.153,Not quite.
01:07:55.572,01:07:57.490,"Well, you didn't lose your sense of humor."
01:07:57.532,01:07:59.659,"Hey, Vincent, you've got some visitors."
01:07:59.701,01:08:01.536,I stay five minutes only.
01:08:01.578,01:08:02.871,Hospital is shit place.
01:08:02.913,01:08:05.665,"You look a lot better, Vin."
01:08:06.750,01:08:08.710,Get this...
01:08:08.752,01:08:12.338,d-dipshit out of here.
01:08:12.380,01:08:13.757,What'd you say?
01:08:16.467,01:08:18.469,Get...
01:08:18.511,01:08:20.597,get this...
01:08:21.598,01:08:23.349,All right.
01:08:24.475,01:08:26.310,How about we just...
01:08:26.352,01:08:28.438,give Vin some time to do his therapy?
01:08:28.479,01:08:29.981,Thank you.
01:08:30.023,01:08:31.315,Go to hell!
01:08:31.357,01:08:32.442,An hour.
01:08:32.483,01:08:33.860,Maybe less.
01:08:33.902,01:08:35.070,DAKA: Why are you so mean?
01:08:35.111,01:08:36.613,You could stop breathing.
01:08:36.654,01:08:38.031,Asshole.
01:08:38.073,01:08:39.156,"Okay, how about we get..."
01:08:39.198,01:08:40.450,"Hey, we're getting a snack."
01:08:40.491,01:08:42.035,-Want a snack?
01:08:42.077,01:08:44.245,Let's get a snack.
01:08:44.287,01:08:51.002,"You know, they do think that his muscles in his mouth will respond to therapy, so that's good."
01:08:51.044,01:08:52.712,He sounds...
01:08:52.754,01:08:54.672,Like the retard.
01:08:54.714,01:08:57.258,"Well, he's stupid man anyway."
01:08:57.300,01:08:58.927,So the retard is not far from.
01:08:58.969,01:09:01.763,Do you have dollar?
01:09:01.805,01:09:03.932,I'm starving; I ate nothing today.
01:09:05.850,01:09:07.936,"Uh, yeah, I probably have..."
01:09:07.978,01:09:10.063,something.
01:09:12.189,01:09:15.234,M-Maybe dollar half is better.
01:09:16.402,01:09:19.155,All right.
01:09:19.196,01:09:21.240,Spasiba.
01:09:25.244,01:09:26.621,Is that Vin's...
01:09:26.663,01:09:28.289,-Baby?
01:09:28.331,01:09:31.793,I like to stay away from the whole situation.
01:09:34.045,01:09:36.047,It's not polite to ask a woman if she's pregnant.
01:09:36.089,01:09:39.634,"Well, I think it's pretty obvious that she's pregnant."
01:09:39.676,01:09:41.970,"Vin's, like, 90-something, Mom."
01:09:42.012,01:09:43.972,-That would be inappropriate.
01:09:42.012,01:09:47.058,"-Hey, if you hit this machine as first candy drops, you can get two to come down."
01:09:47.100,01:09:48.476,"It's good, no?"
01:09:48.518,01:09:50.687,-Thank you.
01:09:54.315,01:09:56.109,"Oh, okay."
01:10:04.909,01:10:06.953,DAKA: Hold on second.
01:10:10.498,01:10:14.044,"Don't eat fast, stupid cat."
01:10:15.045,01:10:17.463,I...
01:10:17.505,01:10:20.175,I want...
01:10:20.216,01:10:22.259,fresh crap.
01:10:24.303,01:10:25.889,Crab.
01:10:25.930,01:10:28.516,Not crap.
01:10:28.558,01:10:30.935,Crab.
01:10:30.977,01:10:34.064,Not crap.
01:10:57.087,01:10:58.755,Okay.
01:10:58.796,01:11:00.631,Money.
01:11:01.799,01:11:04.928,"No, it's a... it's a T."
01:11:04.969,01:11:06.429,Tree. Tree.
01:11:06.470,01:11:08.264,You owe me money.
01:11:08.305,01:11:10.641,"-It's a tree. Yeah, all right."
01:11:10.683,01:11:13.103,"-Yeah, I know. Let's..."
01:11:13.144,01:11:15.230,Okay.
01:11:15.271,01:11:16.856,"What, are you planting these?"
01:11:16.898,01:11:19.109,"Here, this should be familiar."
01:11:19.150,01:11:20.651,Cactus.
01:11:20.693,01:11:23.238,"No, prick."
01:11:23.279,01:11:25.240,Big prick.
01:11:54.769,01:11:56.896,"Wonderful, wonderful."
01:12:04.028,01:12:06.156,Daka...
01:12:06.197,01:12:09.284,is beautiful.
01:12:11.494,01:12:16.040,"I know you just want special massage or something, a dance later."
01:12:16.082,01:12:17.292,Don't try charming.
01:12:17.333,01:12:19.752,It doesn't work.
01:12:21.879,01:12:23.965,"Don't worry, okay?"
01:12:24.007,01:12:26.050,It's going to get better.
01:12:35.018,01:12:37.145,Still there?
01:12:38.646,01:12:40.439,Wait.
01:12:40.481,01:12:41.899,Sucker!
01:12:47.280,01:12:48.948,Down the stretch they come!
01:12:53.536,01:12:56.998,I'm sorry.
01:13:15.058,01:13:17.018,Where's...
01:13:17.060,01:13:19.062,all my dirt?
01:13:37.038,01:13:38.414,"WOMAN: My name's Regina, I have..."
01:13:38.455,01:13:41.167,Keep clean this house.
01:13:43.878,01:13:45.296,What's all that?
01:13:45.338,01:13:46.422,Vegetables.
01:13:46.463,01:13:48.216,Get out of that!
01:13:49.550,01:13:51.677,"You don't know this, vegetables?"
01:13:52.720,01:13:55.014,"I do, but..."
01:13:56.974,01:13:58.601,...I don't-don't eat them.
01:13:58.642,01:13:59.936,You do now.
01:13:59.977,01:14:02.397,"And you pay me for the hours now, Papa."
01:14:02.438,01:14:03.564,Okay?
01:14:03.606,01:14:04.857,What...
01:14:04.899,01:14:05.900,for?
01:14:05.942,01:14:07.443,I take care of you.
01:14:07.484,01:14:09.237,"And we don't bump the ugly parts no more, okay?"
01:14:09.279,01:14:10.405,So don't ask.
01:14:10.446,01:14:12.240,You're too old for this.
01:14:12.282,01:14:14.242,And I'm too fat.
01:14:14.284,01:14:16.660,$15 for the hours.
01:14:16.702,01:14:18.746,Plus room and food.
01:14:18.788,01:14:21.791,I'll get my secret pickles.
01:14:21.832,01:14:25.211,Okay.
01:14:25.253,01:14:28.172,-JUDGE: Who is Vincent MacKenna?
01:14:28.214,01:14:30.758,-You know him?
01:14:28.214,01:14:32.260,"-Yes, he's-he's my neighbor, and he sometimes watches Oliver."
01:14:32.302,01:14:35.346,"LAWYER: Your Honor, he's my client's neighbor."
01:14:35.388,01:14:38.599,"He occasionally watches Oliver, sometimes."
01:14:38.641,01:14:40.351,He's your babysitter?
01:14:40.393,01:14:41.518,Y...
01:14:41.560,01:14:43.520,"Yeah, I mean, sort of."
01:14:43.562,01:14:45.856,I-I pay him.
01:14:43.562,01:14:49.485,"Oliver, you know, goes over there for a few hours after school when I'm still at work."
01:14:49.526,01:14:52.113,"He's the babysitter, Your Honor, of sorts."
01:14:52.155,01:14:53.323,A paid position.
01:14:53.364,01:14:54.907,May I ask why this is relevant?
01:14:54.949,01:15:00.621,"Is your client aware that Mr. MacKenna takes her son to the racetrack, and they gamble?"
01:15:00.663,01:15:03.166,He also takes him to a local bar.
01:15:05.168,01:15:07.628,We went to the horses a few times.
01:15:07.670,01:15:09.755,A few times?
01:15:10.881,01:15:12.425,"-Well, a little."
01:15:14.302,01:15:17.263,I... This is completely news to me.
01:15:17.305,01:15:18.264,I've never heard this before.
01:15:18.306,01:15:24.061,"My client is unaware of these events, as am I, which is, uh, a big surprise right now."
01:15:24.103,01:15:27.857,"I'll bet there are quite a few surprises in this folder, then."
01:15:27.898,01:15:30.651,"-Oh, God."
01:15:31.777,01:15:34.030,Are you aware of her occupation?
01:15:35.365,01:15:37.241,She-she works for Vin.
01:15:37.283,01:15:39.410,"She works for Vin, right?"
01:15:41.287,01:15:42.872,She's a lady of the night.
01:15:44.123,01:15:45.291,What?
01:15:45.333,01:15:46.834,Do you know what that means?
01:15:46.876,01:15:49.753,She works at night?
01:15:54.425,01:15:57.803,She may be a prostitute.
01:16:00.097,01:16:05.019,"Your Honor, uh, I need a few minutes to, um, confer with my client."
01:16:05.061,01:16:06.729,I imagine you do.
01:16:09.648,01:16:12.443,"I guess gambling and a racetrack is like a math class, huh?"
01:16:12.485,01:16:15.363,-You got to learn how to bet?
01:16:15.405,01:16:17.407,"Guess that could fall under current events, right?"
01:16:17.448,01:16:20.201,More like social studies.
01:16:22.161,01:16:25.622,It's the strip club hooker that I can't seem to get my head around.
01:16:25.664,01:16:27.791,Commerce?
01:16:27.833,01:16:29.710,Biology?
01:16:29.752,01:16:31.546,Just stop talking.
01:16:31.587,01:16:33.964,Don't talk.
01:16:37.593,01:16:40.012,Vin!
01:16:40.054,01:16:42.348,Vin!
01:16:42.390,01:16:44.392,Vin!
01:16:47.562,01:16:51.441,Why do you people think my people can't hear?
01:16:51.482,01:16:55.194,What kind of a man takes a child to a bar and to the racetrack?
01:16:55.236,01:16:57.821,And has him hanging out with a prostitute?
01:16:57.863,01:17:06.038,What kind of mother lets her son hang out with a man like that?
01:17:06.080,01:17:08.082,"-You're an asshole, Vin."
01:17:08.124,01:17:11.586,"50-50 custody with his asshole dad, and I have you to thank for that."
01:17:11.627,01:17:17.049,You have no one but yourself to blame for that.
01:17:17.091,01:17:19.885,He needs more than...
01:17:21.053,01:17:22.805,a deadbeat mother.
01:17:23.931,01:17:25.224,Good one.
01:17:25.266,01:17:26.683,And maybe I deserve that.
01:17:26.725,01:17:29.437,I don't know what the hell I was thinking letting him hang out with you.
01:17:29.479,01:17:31.188,My sentiments exactly.
01:17:31.230,01:17:33.065,"Well, he's not coming over there anymore."
01:17:33.107,01:17:34.609,That's a given.
01:17:34.650,01:17:37.487,I'll get you your money for your stupid tree.
01:17:37.528,01:17:39.738,There'll be some interest.
01:17:39.780,01:17:41.198,"Yeah, good luck with that."
01:17:43.700,01:17:45.702,"Oh, I'm sorry! Sorry!"
01:17:47.163,01:17:50.374,My reaction time is much slower these days.
01:17:50.416,01:17:51.959,"Yeah, you were never fast, just stupid."
01:18:01.636,01:18:04.221,AUTOMATED VOICE: You have seven new messages.
01:18:06.599,01:18:10.811,"Hello, Vin. This is Ana here at Sunnyside."
01:18:10.853,01:18:15.316,"I'm afraid we have some bad news regarding your wife, Sandy, sir."

01:18:21.905,01:18:24.825,"Vin, hello, it's Ana again at Sunnyside."
01:18:24.867,01:18:28.287,We haven't heard back from you regarding Sandy.
01:18:28.329,01:18:30.623,Please call us right away.
01:18:36.128,01:18:38.922,"Vincent, uh, we've left a few messages for you."
01:18:38.964,01:18:40.424,We haven't heard back.
01:18:40.466,01:18:42.426,We really need to hear from you about Sandy.
01:18:42.468,01:18:44.554,Please call or come by as soon as possible.
01:19:14.083,01:19:16.419,SHIRLEY: Okay.
01:19:16.460,01:19:18.337,"Here we go, Vin."
01:19:18.379,01:19:22.299,All of Sandy's personal items are in there.
01:19:22.341,01:19:26.762,"My wife, where is she?"
01:19:26.803,01:19:29.014,"She died, Vin."
01:19:29.056,01:19:31.183,I know that.
01:19:31.225,01:19:32.893,Where is she?
01:19:32.935,01:19:34.978,She's in there.
01:19:37.648,01:19:38.982,Where?
01:19:39.024,01:19:41.068,In the box.
01:19:41.110,01:19:42.695,"Her remains, Vin."
01:19:45.030,01:19:46.616,She died a few weeks ago.
01:19:46.657,01:19:49.619,We tried contacting you several times.
01:19:49.660,01:19:53.997,"And when we didn't hear back from you, we decided to go ahead with your death directives."
01:19:54.039,01:19:55.541,You wanted her cremated.
01:19:56.667,01:19:58.586,She's in that box?
01:19:58.628,01:20:02.590,"Her remains are, Vin, yes."
01:20:02.632,01:20:06.093,In a box inside that box.
01:20:08.471,01:20:10.514,"I am sorry for your loss, Vin."
01:20:15.102,01:20:19.106,DAKA: This place is peace.
01:20:20.149,01:20:21.817,It...
01:20:22.859,01:20:24.737,was.
01:20:35.790,01:20:37.500,"-Okay, see you later."
01:20:37.541,01:20:39.335,"Later, Oliver."
01:20:39.376,01:20:41.337,"-Hey, you got a lot of homework?"
01:20:41.378,01:20:43.046,"Uh, art, some math."
01:20:43.088,01:20:44.298,Okay.
01:20:44.340,01:20:46.550,Is she with us?
01:20:46.592,01:20:51.096,"Yeah, she's your father's idea of safer child care."
01:20:51.138,01:20:52.264,What's her name?
01:20:52.306,01:20:53.974,"You have a voice, you ask her."
01:20:54.016,01:20:55.685,"Excuse me, what's your name?"
01:20:55.726,01:20:57.060,Amelda.
01:20:57.102,01:20:58.521,"Hi, Amelda."
01:20:58.562,01:20:59.855,"Hola, Mr. Oliver."
01:20:59.896,01:21:01.524,Is she every day?
01:21:01.565,01:21:04.401,And every other weekend when you're gonna go to your dad's.
01:21:04.443,01:21:05.861,"That's what it's gonna be now, bub."
01:21:05.902,01:21:08.614,You're gonna get shuffled back and forth between me and him.
01:21:08.656,01:21:12.117,"Well, he is my dad."
01:21:12.159,01:21:16.205,"I know he cheated on you a bunch of times, and..."
01:21:16.246,01:21:17.665,that's why we left him.
01:21:17.707,01:21:20.042,Really?
01:21:20.917,01:21:22.336,How-how do you know that?
01:21:22.378,01:21:24.505,You'll tell anybody who'll listen.
01:21:24.547,01:21:27.591,"Grandma, Aunt Judy, all the cousins."
01:21:27.633,01:21:29.844,It's also your Facebook status.
01:21:31.011,01:21:32.722,I know.
01:21:32.763,01:21:34.973,I've been meaning to change that.
01:21:35.015,01:21:36.183,I...
01:21:36.225,01:21:38.435,should just say I'm single.
01:21:38.477,01:21:40.145,"Yeah, that's better."
01:21:49.405,01:21:52.241,"Hey, Vin."
01:21:53.325,01:21:54.869,My replacement?
01:21:54.910,01:21:56.620,"Yeah, I guess so."
01:21:56.662,01:22:01.876,I'd hate to have to report your mother to Immigration and N-N-Natur...
01:22:01.917,01:22:03.377,I am a citizen.
01:22:04.837,01:22:08.965,"Mr. Oliver, one minute."
01:22:10.133,01:22:12.094,What's in the box?
01:22:12.135,01:22:14.263,My wife.
01:22:15.264,01:22:17.182,She died?
01:22:17.224,01:22:18.975,No.
01:22:19.017,01:22:21.270,She-she-she shrunk herself.
01:22:21.311,01:22:23.397,She's living in there now.
01:22:24.523,01:22:26.066,Rent-free.
01:22:26.108,01:22:30.529,"Sorry, Vin, for your loss."
01:22:31.572,01:22:34.366,Never understood...
01:22:34.408,01:22:37.912,why people say that.
01:22:37.953,01:22:40.748,They don't know what else to say.
01:22:40.790,01:22:44.293,"How about, What was she like?"
01:22:44.334,01:22:46.629,Do you miss her?
01:22:46.670,01:22:49.840,Or-or What are you gonna do now?
01:22:52.301,01:22:54.804,Do yourself a favor.
01:22:54.845,01:22:57.222,Get a life.
01:22:57.264,01:22:59.850,Stop living mine.
01:23:01.852,01:23:04.146,Take my word.
01:23:04.187,01:23:06.982,It's not working for shit for me.
01:23:07.023,01:23:09.192,That's not true.
01:23:09.234,01:23:11.403,What the...
01:23:11.445,01:23:15.073,hell do you know about me?
01:23:17.785,01:23:20.329,You don't know me.
01:23:20.370,01:23:22.498,You're just stupid.
01:23:23.833,01:23:26.710,Of course I'm stupid.
01:23:28.378,01:23:35.469,"M-M-Mostly for thinking you're more than just a drunk, mean old man."
01:23:36.428,01:23:38.806,Guess that's good-bye.
01:23:42.559,01:23:45.020,You're sad.
01:23:45.061,01:23:47.105,Sad man.
01:24:00.118,01:24:04.581,"I loved you to the m-moon there, Sandy."
01:24:04.623,01:24:07.584,I loved you to the moon.
01:25:07.770,01:25:09.980,"All right, two weeks."
01:25:10.022,01:25:12.775,Two weeks to our Saints Among Us assembly.
01:25:12.816,01:25:17.529,-The grand culmination of your sizable efforts on one great stage.
01:25:17.571,01:25:21.533,"Don't forget to invite your parents, significant others, et cetera."
01:25:21.575,01:25:24.411,"Wives, girlfriends, and enjoy yourselves."
01:25:24.453,01:25:27.706,"And no expletives in your presentation, please, Ocinski."
01:25:27.748,01:25:30.417,"He doesn't like Ocinski, Brother Geraghty, never has."
01:25:30.459,01:25:33.587,"The name's Robert, sir."
01:25:47.142,01:25:49.686,tell you he was a soldier?
01:25:49.728,01:25:51.605,"-No, sir."
01:25:49.728,01:25:53.690,"-A sergeant major, of all things."
01:25:57.069,01:25:58.612,But it's too expensive.
01:25:58.654,01:26:03.325,I don't know how to buy this crib that looks nice and is cheap enough.
01:26:03.366,01:26:04.994,"I... Oh, this one?"
01:26:05.035,01:26:06.411,This is good.
01:26:06.453,01:26:08.038,"Ma'am, I'm sorry, this is the wrong price."
01:26:08.080,01:26:09.372,I like this.
01:26:09.414,01:26:10.707,"No, no, no, I like this."
01:26:10.749,01:26:12.709,-This is great. I love this.
01:26:12.751,01:26:14.419,-This is fantastic.
01:26:14.461,01:26:15.504,We can afford this.
01:26:15.545,01:26:17.172,-Ma'am...
01:26:17.213,01:26:18.632,I like this. I want this.
01:26:18.674,01:26:19.883,This is great.
01:26:19.925,01:26:21.426,"Okay, I'll take this."
01:26:29.559,01:26:31.227,That's the old guy?
01:26:31.269,01:26:33.271,"Yeah, he was in Vietnam."
01:26:33.313,01:26:34.606,Did I study the states?
01:26:34.648,01:26:35.941,It's a country.
01:26:35.983,01:26:38.360,States are inside countries.
01:26:38.401,01:26:44.033,"DAKA: Do not place items with string around child's neck, such as hoods strings or pacifier cords."
01:26:44.074,01:26:46.743,Strings can cause strangulation.
01:26:46.785,01:26:49.454,I don't want this crib.
01:26:54.292,01:26:56.837,"Hey, Dad."
01:26:56.879,01:26:58.130,Good day?
01:26:58.172,01:26:59.422,Yeah.
01:26:59.464,01:27:00.924,"All right, seat belt, please."
01:27:00.966,01:27:03.635,How long has Vin been doing Sandy's laundry?
01:27:03.677,01:27:07.931,"Oh, geez, every week for eight years."
01:27:07.973,01:27:09.474,That's a long time.
01:27:09.516,01:27:11.226,It is a long time.
01:27:11.267,01:27:13.187,"He's a good guy, Vin."
01:27:22.320,01:27:24.114,What's Vin like when I'm not around?
01:27:24.156,01:27:25.824,He don't like people.
01:27:25.866,01:27:27.659,People don't like him.
01:27:27.701,01:27:29.828,Except cat and you.
01:27:29.870,01:27:31.246,Why you like him?
01:27:39.462,01:27:42.049,That-That'll be straight.
01:27:45.635,01:27:47.763,"MAGGIE: Oliver, come on!"
01:27:50.390,01:27:52.017,Breakfast is ready!
01:27:52.059,01:27:54.186,Gonna get cold!
01:27:55.270,01:27:57.397,Let's go!
01:28:00.776,01:28:02.903,"-Hi, Mom."
01:28:02.945,01:28:04.279,Sit down.
01:28:04.320,01:28:07.032,"You need some fuel for your big day, right?"
01:28:07.074,01:28:08.867,Sit.
01:28:08.909,01:28:11.036,-You made all this?
01:28:11.078,01:28:12.246,I know how to cook.
01:28:12.287,01:28:13.496,I took the day off.
01:28:13.538,01:28:14.539,Thanks.
01:28:14.581,01:28:16.792,"Well, you're welcome, bub."
01:28:16.833,01:28:18.085,This giving you trouble?
01:28:18.127,01:28:21.463,"Come here, I'll show you the trick."
01:28:21.504,01:28:26.927,You got to pop this up Okay?
01:28:26.969,01:28:30.180,"Like that, it's like magic."
01:28:30.222,01:28:32.724,"I love you, Mom."
01:28:32.766,01:28:34.851,"Me, too."
01:28:35.978,01:28:37.187,Sit down.
01:28:37.229,01:28:38.981,"Okay, coffee or juice?"
01:28:39.022,01:28:40.732,"Uh, latte?"
01:28:51.618,01:28:53.954,My water is broken!
01:28:53.996,01:28:56.165,Call a plumber.
01:28:56.206,01:28:57.749,Let's go.
01:28:57.791,01:28:59.876,Get up!
01:29:11.221,01:29:13.223,Hello.
01:29:13.265,01:29:14.891,"Uh, sit down, children, thank you."
01:29:14.933,01:29:19.813,Good morning. Welcome to our Saints Among Us assembly here at Saint Patrick.
01:29:19.855,01:29:25.443,"And the children have been working very hard, and it'll be interesting to see which parents they have chosen as saints."
01:29:25.485,01:29:27.154,I'm sure you're all very nervous.
01:29:27.196,01:29:32.492,"-Um, uh, our first speaker is Keesha Demorcy."
01:29:39.249,01:29:43.795,"For my real-life saint, I picked Mother Teresa of Calcutta."
01:29:47.381,01:29:49.425,"-Okay, okay."
01:29:49.467,01:29:51.511,Anywhere!
01:29:53.680,01:29:55.932,When will you become like man?
01:30:00.896,01:30:03.023,"Jesus, my manhood!"
01:30:03.065,01:30:04.566,"BROTHER GERAGHTY: Saint Nicholas of Sunnyside, everybody."
01:30:08.486,01:30:11.948,"All right, next up we have Oliver Bronstein."
01:30:11.990,01:30:14.117,Oliver Bronstein.
01:30:19.956,01:30:25.587,Saints are human beings we celebrate for their commitment and dedication to other human beings.
01:30:25.628,01:30:29.383,"Brother Geraghty, circa around March."
01:30:34.888,01:30:37.515,This isn't the hospital.
01:30:37.557,01:30:40.518,"Oh, so now you are rocket surgeon."
01:30:40.560,01:30:47.692,"For my modern day saint, I chose a man who shares many of the same qualities as Saint William of Rochester."
01:30:47.734,01:30:53.198,"On the surface, one might think my saint is the least likely candidate for sainthood."
01:30:53.240,01:30:55.325,He's not a happy person.
01:30:55.367,01:30:59.204,"He doesn't like people, and not many people like him."
01:30:59.246,01:31:03.666,"He's grumpy, angry, mad at the world, and I'm sure full of regrets."
01:31:03.708,01:31:06.460,"He drinks too much, smokes."
01:31:06.502,01:31:09.423,"He gambles, curses, lies and cheats."
01:31:09.463,01:31:12.550,And he spends a lot of time with a lady of the night.
01:31:14.844,01:31:16.763,But that's what you see at first glance.
01:31:16.805,01:31:18.848,-PRIEST: After you.
01:31:16.805,01:31:21.475,"-If you dig deeper, you'll see a man beyond his flaws."
01:31:23.061,01:31:31.027,"Mr. Vincent MacKenna was born in 1946 in Sheepshead Bay, the son of first-generation Irish immigrants."
01:31:33.863,01:31:42.789,"Growing up poor on the streets of Brooklyn, Vincent learned all the things that kids shouldn't need to know-- fighting, cursing and gambling."
01:31:42.831,01:31:55.969,"In 1965, as a member of the United States Army's Fifth Regiment, Vincent was among the 450 soldiers dropped into the La Drang Valley and immediately ambushed by 2,000 enemy troops."
01:31:56.011,01:32:03.726,There he heroically saved the lives of two wounded officers pinned down by enemy fire and carried them to safety.
01:32:03.768,01:32:07.481,He was awarded the Bronze Star for his bravery.
01:32:07.521,01:32:14.446,I imagine the best way I can tell you who Mr. Vincent MacKenna is is to tell you what he's done for me.
01:32:14.488,01:32:23.163,"When me and my mom first moved here, we knew no one, and Mr. MacKenna took me in when he didn't have to, and most likely didn't want to."
01:32:23.205,01:32:26.124,"But he did it anyhow, 'cause that's what saints do."
01:32:26.166,01:32:31.921,"We visited his wife, Sandy, of 40 years who recently passed away."
01:32:31.963,01:32:37.344,"Vin's done her laundry every week for the past eight years, long after she no longer recognized him."
01:32:37.386,01:32:39.637,Because saints never give up.
01:32:39.679,01:32:46.144,"He taught me how to fight, how to stand my ground and be brave, how to speak up and be bold."
01:32:46.186,01:32:50.732,"Because saints fight for themselves and others, so that they might be heard."
01:32:50.773,01:32:58.656,"He taught me how to gamble, horse racing, Keno, the over and under, which is a big reason why I'm grounded till I'm 18."
01:33:00.742,01:33:04.871,"But in that, I learned how to take risks and go for broke."
01:33:04.913,01:33:07.916,"Because in life, the odds can be stacked against you."
01:33:07.957,01:33:13.547,"This is Vin's cat, Felix, who eats gourmet cat food while Vin eats sardines."
01:33:13.587,01:33:16.383,'Cause saints make sacrifices.
01:33:16.425,01:33:22.805,"Yes, Mr. Vincent MacKenna is flawed, seriously flawed, but just like all the other saints we studied."
01:33:22.847,01:33:29.312,"Because after all, saints are human beings, very human beings."
01:33:29.354,01:33:32.232,"Courage, sacrifice, compassion, humanity."
01:33:32.274,01:33:39.531,"These are the markings of a saint, and what makes Mr. Vincent MacKenna not so far removed from Saint William of Rochester."
01:33:39.573,01:33:50.666,"And with that, I'd like to present my friend and babysitter, Mr. Vincent MacKenna, for sainthood, and hereby proclaim him Saint Vincent of Sheepshead Bay."
01:34:36.004,01:34:38.256,"Thank you, sir."
01:34:38.298,01:34:41.343,"Thank you, kid."
01:34:56.316,01:35:00.612,BROTHER GERAGHTY: Saint Vincent of Sheepshead Bay.
01:35:00.654,01:35:03.281,"All right, I got it."
01:35:03.323,01:35:04.533,I owe you money anyhow.
01:35:04.574,01:35:06.075,-Thanks.
01:35:06.117,01:35:08.036,"Uh, hard pretzels."
01:35:08.077,01:35:09.496,That's just what I was looking at.
01:35:09.538,01:35:14.250,"If you do it just right, you can end up with..."
01:35:14.292,01:35:15.709,two...
01:35:15.751,01:35:18.129,for the price of one.
01:35:18.171,01:35:19.381,Pretty cool.
01:35:19.422,01:35:21.174,"That's pretty good, kiddo."
01:35:21.216,01:35:23.385,I might have to adopt that.
01:35:23.426,01:35:25.719,"Mr. MacKenna, it's about that time."
01:35:25.761,01:35:27.347,"All right, hold your horses."
01:35:27.389,01:35:30.058,"Although, technically, that's stealing."
01:35:39.442,01:35:41.986,"Oh, it's okay, it's okay."
01:35:42.028,01:35:43.779,It's okay.
01:35:43.821,01:35:44.989,So what is it?
01:35:45.031,01:35:48.201,"Black, white, ugly?"
01:35:48.243,01:35:49.661,Get out of here.
01:35:49.703,01:35:52.038,I like this baby.
01:35:53.915,01:35:56.209,-Do you like this baby?
01:35:57.377,01:35:59.003,"Yeah, so far."
01:35:59.045,01:36:01.839,I'm so happy.
01:36:08.722,01:36:10.139,DAKA: I'll teach you someday.
01:36:10.181,01:36:11.600,-You'll like it.
01:36:11.641,01:36:14.143,"It's not Russian, but..."
01:36:14.185,01:36:15.311,"Okay, you must eat vegetables."
01:36:15.353,01:36:17.439,It's colorful.
01:36:17.480,01:36:18.648,I'll say that.
01:36:18.690,01:36:20.400,I-I like the green beans.
01:36:20.442,01:36:22.694,-You do?
01:36:20.442,01:36:24.279,"-Yeah, I don't think you ever get enough spaghetti and green beans."
01:36:24.320,01:36:26.239,My mom makes them out of a can.
01:36:26.281,01:36:27.699,That's how your brain got stilted.
01:36:27.741,01:36:29.825,"Oh, you have stilted brain."
01:36:29.867,01:36:30.826,That's probably good.
01:36:30.868,01:36:32.245,Like the retard.
01:36:32.287,01:36:34.122,"Hey, the R word's not cool."
01:36:34.163,01:36:35.957,It's not politically correct.
01:36:35.998,01:36:38.209,-Why is this?
01:36:38.251,01:36:39.835,Midget?
01:36:39.877,01:36:41.630,Why not midget?
01:36:43.047,01:36:45.133,This food beats hunger.
01:36:46.217,01:36:47.761,By a hair.
01:36:49.178,01:36:51.681,OLIVER: Don't you want to say something?
01:36:51.723,01:36:52.848,Like what?
01:36:52.890,01:36:55.268,Like a blessing or a prayer?
01:37:06.070,01:37:07.863,"No, I'd better not."
01:37:12.952,01:37:15.163,Baby is hungry.
01:37:15.204,01:37:18.124,"All this delicious food, and where's yours?"
01:37:18.166,01:37:23.087,"It's not fair for everyone to have a big meal except you, huh?"
01:37:23.129,01:37:24.589,Oh!
01:37:24.631,01:37:25.674,Oh!
01:37:25.715,01:37:29.218,"Hey, wow, it's chill..."
01:37:29.260,01:37:30.886,it's getting chilly in here.
01:38:16.432,01:38:18.768,"DAKA: I smell the cigarette, asshole!"
