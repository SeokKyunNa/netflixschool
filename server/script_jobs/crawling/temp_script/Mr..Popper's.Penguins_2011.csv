00:02:31.401,00:02:33.988,I'm right on the verge of something big here.
00:02:34.029,00:02:36.406,But... I'm not going to make it home for your birthday.
00:02:36.448,00:02:41.202,"I'm really sorry, but opportunities like this are hard to find, son."
00:02:47.417,00:02:50.378,"Opportunities like this are hard to find, Franklin."
00:02:50.420,00:02:54.215,I'm about to bag a rare species on this little expedition.
00:02:54.257,00:02:57.260,15 F.A.R.-- that's a million absolute.
00:02:57.302,00:02:58.846,And a landmark building.
00:02:58.887,00:03:01.222,"Ah, don't thank me."
00:03:01.264,00:03:02.223,"Morning, Pippi."

00:03:05.936,00:03:07.688,I love the smell of toner in the morning.
00:03:07.729,00:03:11.274,"That's the pertinent printout, and the person we're purchasing the property from is present."
00:03:11.316,00:03:13.276,'S do it.
00:03:13.318,00:03:15.988,Mr. Popper for Mr. Gremmins.
00:03:16.030,00:03:17.656,And you are?
00:03:17.698,00:03:18.907,Pippi Peponopolis.
00:03:18.949,00:03:20.075,I'm Mr. Popper's personal assistant.
00:03:20.117,00:03:22.410,"I process his paperwork, and I procure his periodicals."
00:03:22.452,00:03:23.996,She doesn't even know she's doing it.
00:03:24.038,00:03:25.246,Pardon?
00:03:25.288,00:03:27.582,You can go in.
00:03:25.288,00:03:30.585,"MAN: Mr. Popper, sorry to waste your time, but, uh..."
00:03:30.627,00:03:32.129,I've changed my mind.
00:03:32.171,00:03:34.048,I'm not going to sell.
00:03:34.089,00:03:35.256,I understand.
00:03:35.298,00:03:37.759,Second thoughts are as valid as first thoughts.
00:03:37.801,00:03:38.969,They just come later.
00:03:39.011,00:03:42.764,"It's just that this building is my last holding, and if I sell, then..."
00:03:42.806,00:03:45.266,"Then you're free, and that's a scary thing."
00:03:45.308,00:03:47.061,Hey.
00:03:47.102,00:03:48.269,I get it.
00:03:48.311,00:03:50.147,Doing any sailing this year?
00:03:51.732,00:03:53.067,Who has the time?
00:03:53.108,00:03:55.276,Yeah. My father sailed around the world solo.
00:03:55.318,00:03:57.278,Oh. Lucky man.
00:03:57.320,00:04:00.240,Yeah. Pulled a Hemingway.
00:04:00.281,00:04:02.201,"You know, that's always been a..."
00:04:02.242,00:04:03.284,a dream of mine.
00:04:03.326,00:04:05.871,Oh. He had some stories.
00:04:05.913,00:04:08.707,Like that storm off the Horn of Africa.
00:04:08.749,00:04:11.001,The Horn of Africa?
00:04:11.043,00:04:19.259,"The sea was calm, the sailing smooth, when out 20-foot swells, like a hammer punch to the prow."
00:04:19.300,00:04:22.429,"Dad was a heck of a sailor, but he'd never seen waves like this."
00:04:23.847,00:04:25.306,Gale force winds...
00:04:25.348,00:04:29.394,"straight from the Devil's nostrils, whipped his ship like a rubber ducky."
00:04:29.436,00:04:31.396,"Salt spray in his face felt like 1,000 needles."
00:04:31.438,00:04:34.858,"And suddenly, the wind ripped the main sail off the mast!"
00:04:35.943,00:04:38.112,He was doomed.
00:04:38.153,00:04:40.030,What did he do?
00:04:40.072,00:04:44.826,"He spun the wheel, hoisted the jib, threaded the needle backwards."
00:04:44.868,00:04:47.287,"And when he came out the other side... oh, my God."
00:04:47.328,00:04:49.998,"Oh, my God."
00:04:50.040,00:04:52.000,What?
00:04:52.042,00:04:54.086,But it is.
00:04:54.128,00:04:55.545,A blue whale.
00:04:58.506,00:05:02.343,"Like a gentle giant, the most majestic creature on Earth."
00:05:04.263,00:05:05.597,It's so beautiful.
00:05:05.639,00:05:07.224,Can you see it?
00:05:07.266,00:05:09.517,His skin glistening in the sun?
00:05:10.602,00:05:12.854,A rainbow...
00:05:12.896,00:05:15.482,in the spray of his mighty blowhole.
00:05:16.817,00:05:18.986,"Oh, well, you'll get out there."
00:05:19.027,00:05:20.570,Someday.
00:05:27.661,00:05:29.079,Wait.
00:05:32.457,00:05:33.959,"MAN: Way to go, Popper."
00:05:34.001,00:05:36.377,"POPPER: Hey, 'swhat I do."
00:05:36.419,00:05:39.380,"what is the future of Franklin, Reader &amp; Yates?"
00:05:39.422,00:05:45.971,"A long, slow decline, getting older and weaker, till it has that funny smell, starts driving around all day with the left turn signal on?"
00:05:46.013,00:05:47.388,Franklin?
00:05:47.430,00:05:53.394,"Or will it be reborn with vim, vigor and Viagratality?"
00:05:53.436,00:05:55.105,POPPER: I say we meet the future head-on.
00:05:56.898,00:05:58.399,Sexy.

00:06:08.076,00:06:09.077,Named Beyoncé!
00:06:09.119,00:06:11.205,Can he hear me?
00:06:09.119,00:06:12.622,"You know, we had a feeling this was coming, Popper."
00:06:12.664,00:06:15.292,We saw the marble slab in your office.
00:06:15.334,00:06:17.585,Oops.
00:06:15.334,00:06:20.047,"Popper, there's no one more qualified than you to take a seat at this table."
00:06:20.088,00:06:21.464,FRANKLIN: Don't sit just yet.
00:06:21.506,00:06:22.883,Okay.
00:06:22.924,00:06:25.635,There is one more prize we would like you to get for us.
00:06:25.677,00:06:27.512,"Name it, fellas."
00:06:27.554,00:06:29.430,Plaza Hotel?

00:06:36.688,00:06:38.439,Tavern on the Green?
00:06:38.481,00:06:39.983,"What's the matter, Popper?"
00:06:40.025,00:06:41.360,Nothing.
00:06:41.400,00:06:44.779,It's just...
00:06:44.821,00:06:47.949,It's the only privately held real estate in Central Park.
00:06:47.991,00:06:50.660,We can build anything we want on it.
00:06:50.702,00:06:52.996,"You mean, like..."
00:06:53.038,00:06:55.249,wipe it off the face of the Earth?

00:06:57.584,00:07:00.461,Be like it never existed.
00:07:00.503,00:07:03.006,"But first, you've got to get past Selma Van Gundy."
00:07:03.048,00:07:06.009,"She's gotten a thousand offers, turned them all down."
00:07:06.051,00:07:08.178,FRANKLIN: You've got one shot.
00:07:08.220,00:07:09.470,You think you can close it?
00:07:09.512,00:07:11.765,I'm sorry. Have we met?
00:07:11.806,00:07:13.016,I'm Thom Popper.
00:07:13.058,00:07:14.809,I do deals like this in my sleep.

00:07:19.564,00:07:21.233,"Last time, it took a while."
00:07:21.275,00:07:23.902,Keep it running.
00:07:25.570,00:07:27.030,"Thomas, greetings."
00:07:27.072,00:07:29.283,"Greetings, Rick, and welcome to our planet."
00:07:29.324,00:07:33.536,"Lately, we've been using the word hi or a simple, 'Sup?"
00:07:33.578,00:07:36.039,How are you?
00:07:36.081,00:07:37.999,I'm better now.
00:07:38.041,00:07:39.751,"No, really, Thomas, how are you?"
00:07:39.793,00:07:41.253,"Really, I'm good."
00:07:43.630,00:07:45.632,Please look away.
00:07:45.673,00:07:47.884,"Okay, I will."
00:07:50.220,00:07:51.471,"Hey, Popper!"
00:07:51.512,00:07:53.390,I've been working on my power shot.
00:07:53.432,00:07:56.184,"Let's see what you got, tough guy. Come on."
00:08:00.814,00:08:02.482,Nice save.

00:08:10.573,00:08:12.700,Come on. We've only gone out a couple times.
00:08:12.742,00:08:14.202,He's a keeper.
00:08:12.742,00:08:15.787,There is nothing wrong with a man who recycles.
00:08:15.829,00:08:18.999,I turn decrepit old buildings into shiny new ones.
00:08:19.040,00:08:20.208,Did I mention he's also incredibly handsome?
00:08:20.250,00:08:21.542,Really?
00:08:21.584,00:08:23.544,Mmm.
00:08:23.586,00:08:26.547,"And thoughtful, and considerate."
00:08:26.589,00:08:28.049,Where's your sister?
00:08:28.091,00:08:29.550,She's having issues.
00:08:29.592,00:08:31.178,"You know, Cooper Keegan."

00:08:45.192,00:08:47.944,She says she doesn't want to go with you this weekend.
00:08:47.986,00:08:49.404,Maybe you should talk to her.
00:08:49.446,00:08:51.198,Yeahbsolutely.
00:08:52.615,00:08:53.908,What are we looking at?
00:08:53.950,00:08:57.829,BOY: 95 pounds of C-4 explosives on a hair trigger.
00:08:57.871,00:08:59.039,Mm.
00:08:59.080,00:09:00.957,Make sure you clip the right wire; otherwise...
00:09:00.999,00:09:02.583,Ba-boom.
00:09:02.625,00:09:05.962,"You're in the hurt locker now, Popper."
00:09:11.176,00:09:12.552,You want to talk about it?
00:09:13.636,00:09:15.555,Come on.
00:09:18.475,00:09:23.063,"What do you do if you like somebody, but they don't like you back?"
00:09:26.400,00:09:27.984,Janie...
00:09:28.026,00:09:29.569,you're a powerful woman.
00:09:29.610,00:09:31.988,You're a... you're an independent lady.
00:09:32.030,00:09:33.614,"You don't even need a man, really."
00:09:33.656,00:09:35.367,"I mean, look at Martha Stewart."
00:09:35.409,00:09:37.202,"She's rich, and she sleeps with her dogs."
00:09:38.828,00:09:40.038,JANIE: You are so warped!
00:09:38.828,00:09:42.207,I don't know why I thought for one second I could talk to you.
00:09:43.666,00:09:45.168,This is why I don't want to go.
00:09:45.210,00:09:47.421,He cut both wires.
00:09:47.462,00:09:49.297,Come on. It's our weekend.

00:10:44.436,00:10:45.686,Call me.
00:10:45.728,00:10:47.981,It's about your father.
00:10:48.022,00:10:49.316,"So where was he, Reginald?"
00:10:49.357,00:10:50.733,Antarctica.
00:10:50.775,00:10:52.611,Selling ice to the Eskimos?
00:10:52.652,00:10:55.363,No. That's the Arctic.
00:10:55.405,00:10:57.698,Whatever.
00:10:57.740,00:10:59.534,"Your father loved you, Tommy."
00:10:59.576,00:11:01.702,"Oh, that's good to know."
00:11:03.913,00:11:07.125,"The last will and testament of Thomas Popper, Senior."
00:11:07.167,00:11:08.418,Mm.
00:11:08.460,00:11:20.096,"To the good folks at the Geographic Society, I leave my Slovenian zither recordings, the Tahoe yurt and the Uzbek yurt, as well as the rest of my worldly possessions."
00:11:21.348,00:11:25.018,To my little Tommy: I've sent you a souvenir.
00:11:25.059,00:11:30.106,I'm sorry I couldn't deliver this one to you in person.
00:11:30.148,00:11:33.901,"Bald Eagle, over and out."
00:11:44.454,00:11:46.498,Monday.
00:11:46.540,00:11:48.707,Thank God.
00:11:54.172,00:11:55.882,Ah.
00:11:55.923,00:11:57.758,My souvenir.
00:11:57.800,00:12:01.762,"It's too big for a snow globe, too small for a yurt."
00:12:05.016,00:12:06.767,"Oh, wow."
00:12:06.809,00:12:08.144,A stuffed penguin.
00:12:08.186,00:12:10.188,For the man who has everything.
00:12:15.402,00:12:17.904,"Thank you, Daddy."
00:12:22.909,00:12:24.911,Sergeant Pipper.
00:12:24.952,00:12:26.954,"Yeah, I know, I'm late."
00:12:26.996,00:12:28.956,Van Gundy's at the Tavern already?
00:12:28.998,00:12:32.377,"Yes, I know how important she is."
00:12:32.419,00:12:34.795,Okay. Stall her.
00:12:34.837,00:12:35.963,I'll be there in 15 minutes.
00:12:36.005,00:12:37.048,I don't know.
00:12:37.090,00:12:40.759,Tell her I was poisoned by a porcupine or punched by a pedestrian.
00:12:42.011,00:12:43.722,...for?
00:12:58.027,00:12:59.987,I'll call you back.
00:13:04.325,00:13:08.955,It's a... live... penguin.
00:13:08.996,00:13:11.750,He sent me a live penguin.
00:13:24.638,00:13:26.055,Shh. Shh.
00:13:26.097,00:13:29.892,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
00:13:35.022,00:13:36.608,"Hi, live penguin."
00:13:45.700,00:13:48.953,"As soon as I get home, you're going back where you came from."
00:13:49.912,00:13:51.872,See this?
00:13:51.914,00:13:53.541,Not for pecking.
00:13:53.583,00:13:56.336,"Frette towels, also not for penguins."
00:13:56.377,00:13:59.589,"Other than that, don't touch anything."
00:13:59.631,00:14:02.091,"Pippi, hang on."
00:14:02.133,00:14:04.594,Coming... Ow!
00:14:09.932,00:14:12.143,No time for pain.
00:14:23.946,00:14:25.906,Mr. Popper. Phew!
00:14:25.948,00:14:28.576,Punctuality is a priority for this particular person.
00:14:28.618,00:14:29.952,"Don't sweat it, Pip."
00:14:29.994,00:14:34.957,"I'll start scratching this old gal behind the ears, pretty soon she'll be curled up in my lap, purring like a kitty cat."
00:14:37.001,00:14:39.754,Right behind me?
00:14:39.796,00:14:41.798,"Mrs. Van Gundy, pleasure to meet you."
00:14:41.840,00:14:43.090,Thom Popper.
00:14:43.132,00:14:44.967,Mr. Popper.
00:14:50.890,00:14:53.518,I'm afraid I can only offer you ten minutes.
00:14:53.560,00:14:55.936,You're extremely late.
00:14:55.978,00:14:58.147,'Sall I need.
00:15:02.318,00:15:04.945,"This is Tito and Freddy, our kitchen staff."
00:15:04.987,00:15:06.698,Hi.
00:15:06.740,00:15:07.948,He's our handyman.
00:15:07.990,00:15:09.950,"And this is our chef, Arnold."
00:15:09.992,00:15:12.579,His kind of cooking never goes out of style.
00:15:12.620,00:15:14.497,Do you like kidney pie?
00:15:14.539,00:15:16.249,Are you kidding me?
00:15:16.290,00:15:17.958,Ah.
00:15:20.670,00:15:22.338,POPPER: Filled out the card and...
00:15:22.380,00:15:25.299,"No, I've never actually had that, but I would love to try it."
00:15:25.341,00:15:28.052,Mm. Let's have a seat.
00:15:28.094,00:15:29.970,"All right, guys."
00:15:30.012,00:15:34.934,"POPPER: Uh, I wonder if we could sit more in the center of the room."
00:15:34.975,00:15:37.186,I want to get a real sense of the space.
00:15:47.739,00:15:50.950,"You have a very unusual name, Mr. Popper."
00:15:50.991,00:15:52.326,And I never forget one.
00:15:52.368,00:15:56.915,This restaurant has been in my family for three generations.
00:15:56.956,00:16:00.251,My grandmother served coq au vin for Winston Churchill.
00:16:00.293,00:16:03.504,And my father poured champagne for Fred Astaire.
00:16:03.546,00:16:06.925,My mother made a BLT for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once.
00:16:06.966,00:16:12.555,"She said he was surprisingly down-to-earth, which is ironic, considering how tall he is."
00:16:12.597,00:16:14.014,Fascinating.
00:16:14.056,00:16:17.017,But I can't sell this place to just anyone.
00:16:17.059,00:16:20.271,"I mean, I consider the staff to be family, too."
00:16:20.313,00:16:22.022,Nothing more important than family to me.
00:16:22.064,00:16:23.023,Nothing.
00:16:23.065,00:16:24.442,Are you married?
00:16:24.484,00:16:26.903,Not presently.
00:16:26.945,00:16:28.696,Oh. Any children?
00:16:28.738,00:16:34.953,"Two. And, uh, we have the most magical alternate weekends together."
00:16:34.994,00:16:37.413,Tell me about your father.
00:16:37.455,00:16:39.707,My father?
00:16:39.749,00:16:43.085,"Uh, what can I say?"
00:16:43.127,00:16:46.213,"A father is a father, and he was no different."
00:16:46.255,00:16:47.924,You were close?
00:16:47.966,00:16:52.345,"Yes, uh, well, we're... related."
00:16:52.386,00:16:58.768,"But, Mrs. Van Gundy, I want to talk about you and your life beyond all of this."
00:16:58.810,00:17:07.067,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and..."
00:17:07.109,00:17:10.947,kind of a marmalade sky.
00:17:10.989,00:17:13.199,"I don't do drugs, Mr. Popper."
00:17:13.240,00:17:15.075,Let me tell you something.
00:17:15.117,00:17:21.332,I could sell this place to any number of sharp-tongued snake oil salesmen like yourself.
00:17:21.374,00:17:26.671,But I'm not selling to anyone until I know what they're worth.
00:17:26.713,00:17:29.089,You mean my net worth?
00:17:29.131,00:17:33.720,"Well, if that's how you interpret it, that tells me something."
00:17:33.761,00:17:36.096,"Well, I'm afraid your time is up, Mr. Popper."
00:17:36.138,00:17:38.307,The Tavern is not presently for sale.
00:17:38.349,00:17:40.351,Uh...
00:17:43.145,00:17:45.314,Should have gone with Strawberry Fields.
00:18:03.165,00:18:04.959,"Oh, good."
00:18:05.001,00:18:07.127,You sent me a package.
00:18:07.169,00:18:09.129,"Uh, my name is Popper."
00:18:09.171,00:18:12.008,Popper? You Captain Popper baby?
00:18:12.050,00:18:13.384,Captain?
00:18:13.426,00:18:15.511,"Uh, yes."
00:18:15.553,00:18:17.430,I'm Captain Popper baby.
00:18:17.471,00:18:22.142,"My father, who is apparently your captain, had you send me a penguin."
00:18:22.184,00:18:24.144,You like penguin?
00:18:24.186,00:18:27.189,"Is good, yes?"
00:18:27.231,00:18:29.108,Your captain was crazy.
00:18:29.149,00:18:31.151,So crazy. I love.
00:18:31.193,00:18:33.153,"Well, I'm glad you had someone."
00:18:33.195,00:18:36.741,"But listen, I have to send this penguin back."
00:18:36.783,00:18:38.409,What?
00:18:38.451,00:18:41.412,Hello? Hello?
00:18:41.454,00:18:43.456,I have to send the penguin back.
00:18:43.497,00:18:45.041,Send penguin?
00:18:45.083,00:18:46.709,Yes. Send penguin.
00:18:46.751,00:18:49.211,"I told you five times, I have to send the penguin."
00:18:49.253,00:18:51.923,"Five times, send penguin. Okay!"
00:18:51.965,00:18:54.884,Great.
00:18:54.926,00:18:57.177,Can you send me another crate so I can ship this thing?
00:18:58.471,00:19:00.306,Hello?
00:19:01.348,00:19:03.142,Hello?
00:19:06.104,00:19:08.188,What am I going to do with you?
00:19:22.662,00:19:23.997,Oh! You!
00:19:24.038,00:19:26.373,You are so done!
00:19:28.501,00:19:31.087,No. No.
00:19:37.885,00:19:40.596,POPPER: Hello.
00:19:40.638,00:19:44.058,We will be closing one month for ice festival!
00:19:48.646,00:19:50.773,Hey.
00:19:50.815,00:19:52.608,Animal Control.
00:19:52.650,00:19:54.110,I am very happy to see you.
00:19:54.152,00:19:56.112,Um...
00:19:56.154,00:19:57.822,Oh.
00:19:57.864,00:19:59.239,What the...?
00:19:59.281,00:20:01.117,"I didn't know it was a penguin, okay?"
00:20:01.159,00:20:02.576,I'm going to have to check the manual.
00:20:02.618,00:20:04.037,It's not in the book.
00:20:04.078,00:20:05.204,Can't we just call it pigeon?
00:20:06.330,00:20:07.707,"Big, fat pigeon?"
00:20:07.748,00:20:09.249,I can't touch it if it's not in the manual.
00:20:09.291,00:20:10.584,It's a union violation.
00:20:10.626,00:20:11.836,Try Fish and Game.
00:20:11.878,00:20:13.087,No.
00:20:13.129,00:20:14.505,You need Marine and Waterfowl.
00:20:14.547,00:20:15.882,"Sorry, bud."
00:20:15.923,00:20:17.591,Try NYC Sanitation.
00:20:17.633,00:20:21.054,Yeah. I only pick up the dead ones.
00:21:00.927,00:21:02.845,This way.
00:21:04.222,00:21:06.974,Okay. Get. Go.
00:21:07.016,00:21:08.851,Skedaddle.
00:21:08.893,00:21:10.978,Waddle on down the road.
00:21:11.020,00:21:13.022,South Pole's that way.
00:21:13.064,00:21:16.316,"Exit the building, take a right and keep going."
00:21:22.031,00:21:23.490,Okay.
00:21:23.532,00:21:26.410,Need a little help.
00:21:28.579,00:21:31.249,Watch this.
00:21:31.290,00:21:33.584,And...
00:21:33.626,00:21:37.046,...there you go!
00:21:37.088,00:21:38.464,Yes!
00:21:38.505,00:21:40.340,"Bye-bye, birdie."
00:21:41.717,00:21:42.969,"Hey, Mr. P."
00:21:43.010,00:21:44.470,Yeah.
00:21:44.511,00:21:46.055,I got your penguin for you.
00:21:46.097,00:21:47.347,What?
00:21:47.389,00:21:48.975,What are you talking about?
00:21:49.016,00:21:50.101,That's not my penguin.
00:21:50.143,00:21:51.351,"Oh, really?"
00:21:51.393,00:21:54.063,Why would I have a penguin?
00:22:03.239,00:22:05.283,"Well, that could be anybody."
00:22:05.324,00:22:06.951,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:10.329,00:22:12.248,Just give me the stupid thing.
00:22:13.415,00:22:18.963,So the board must have given you a free pass on the whole no pets thing.
00:22:19.005,00:22:21.381,That is mighty nice of them.
00:22:21.423,00:22:24.260,How much till you don't see a penguin?
00:22:27.263,00:22:28.889,"Oh, I can still see him."
00:22:30.057,00:22:31.600,It's getting blurry.
00:22:31.642,00:22:34.645,"If I decided to squint, it could look like a puppy."
00:22:34.687,00:22:37.231,How's that?
00:22:38.316,00:22:40.193,"Is that you, Mr. P?"
00:22:40.234,00:22:42.360,The-the light's going dim.
00:22:42.402,00:22:43.654,"Yeah, Pippi."
00:22:43.696,00:22:45.363,PIPPI: Mr. Popper?
00:22:43.696,00:22:47.365,"Yeah, I'm not coming in to work again today."
00:22:47.407,00:22:49.618,I have a pest problem.
00:22:49.660,00:22:50.953,It's a penguin.
00:22:50.995,00:22:52.538,Penguin?!
00:22:52.579,00:22:54.372,You ought to be able to handle it.
00:22:54.414,00:22:55.624,"Hey there, Popper."
00:22:55.666,00:22:57.043,Kent.
00:22:57.084,00:23:00.171,Is... is that a...
00:23:00.213,00:23:02.006,Pet? No.
00:23:02.048,00:23:03.423,What? Of course not.
00:23:03.465,00:23:05.843,Okay.
00:23:05.885,00:23:09.972,"If I had your 3,200 square feet, I'd find someone to share it with, too."
00:23:10.014,00:23:11.224,"Well, it's not a pet, Kent."
00:23:11.265,00:23:12.558,I left the television on.
00:23:12.599,00:23:14.060,I'll take care of it.
00:23:20.440,00:23:21.942,Digital surround.
00:23:21.984,00:23:25.403,It's like a real animal in there busting stuff.
00:23:25.445,00:23:28.157,'Samazing.
00:23:28.199,00:23:29.242,"Bye, Kent."

00:23:45.966,00:23:48.177,"You like that, huh?"
00:23:48.219,00:23:49.220,Too bad.
00:23:51.389,00:23:53.182,reviewing these numbers...

00:24:00.564,00:24:02.816,I don't know what people see in you.

00:24:19.166,00:24:21.127,"No big deal, right?"
00:24:21.168,00:24:23.712,"All right, penguin, no long good-byes."
00:24:23.754,00:24:25.714,Let's go.
00:24:25.756,00:24:26.924,Come here.
00:24:26.966,00:24:28.717,Gotcha!
00:24:28.759,00:24:30.719,Game's over.
00:24:30.761,00:24:31.971,You lose.
00:24:34.014,00:24:36.434,"Okay, I'll just seal you in."
00:24:36.474,00:24:37.643,Whoa!
00:24:37.684,00:24:39.645,"Where do you think you're going, hah?"
00:24:39.686,00:24:43.149,"My kid's birthday's in ten minutes, okay?"
00:24:43.190,00:24:46.735,I make the rules...
00:24:46.777,00:24:49.071,'cause I have the brains.
00:24:55.161,00:24:57.704,Wait.
00:24:57.746,00:24:59.039,How'd you...
00:25:03.002,00:25:05.545,What the...?
00:25:17.599,00:25:19.143,Ooh!
00:25:21.187,00:25:22.396,PENGUIN: Oh...!
00:25:22.438,00:25:24.940,POPPER: Hey!
00:25:24.982,00:25:27.109,It's an infestation.
00:25:28.361,00:25:30.237,How'd you even get up there?
00:25:30.279,00:25:32.114,"Your legs are, like, four inches long."
00:25:32.156,00:25:33.199,"Oh, geez."
00:25:33.240,00:25:34.992,Obviously a little miscommunication.
00:25:36.160,00:25:37.953,"All right, who's hungry?"
00:25:39.163,00:25:40.622,"Come on, you little snow rats."
00:25:41.623,00:25:42.624,Oh!
00:25:42.666,00:25:43.917,"Ooh, hey!"
00:25:43.959,00:25:46.170,"Gosh, thought you guys would never get here."
00:25:46.212,00:25:48.172,That's great.
00:25:46.212,00:25:49.547,You ready for the big birthday celebration fiesta?
00:25:49.589,00:25:52.550,But here's the thing-- not quite ready yet.
00:25:52.592,00:25:57.431,"So, can you just hang out for a bit while I get Billy's gift all set?"
00:25:57.473,00:26:01.685,"Translation: I forgot as usual, and I need to call Pippi to go get something."
00:26:01.727,00:26:04.146,Not true.
00:26:04.188,00:26:07.191,"I got the gift, and it's right in here."
00:26:09.026,00:26:11.195,BILLY: Yeah! A penguin!
00:26:11.237,00:26:14.156,"No. Billy, I actually..."
00:26:14.198,00:26:15.115,He's awesome!
00:26:15.157,00:26:16.534,"Oh, great."
00:26:16.574,00:26:18.827,Hold on.
00:26:18.869,00:26:20.829,You got him an actual live penguin?
00:26:20.871,00:26:21.997,Uh...
00:26:22.039,00:26:24.958,BILLY: Six penguins?!
00:26:25.000,00:26:27.753,Yes! Best birthday ever!
00:26:27.794,00:26:29.505,"That's good counting, Billy."
00:26:29.547,00:26:30.506,Do they have names?
00:26:30.548,00:26:32.883,Yeah. Of course.
00:26:32.925,00:26:34.343,"Uh, this one's..."
00:26:34.385,00:26:36.636,Captain.
00:26:36.678,00:26:37.930,Captain Popper.
00:26:39.139,00:26:41.892,And that's Lou...dy.
00:26:41.934,00:26:44.770,Hey! Hey!
00:26:44.811,00:26:47.814,And that one's... Bitey.
00:26:50.776,00:26:52.111,Stinky.
00:26:52.152,00:26:55.655,AMANDA: Aw... he loves me.
00:26:55.697,00:26:57.908,"Well, that's... Lovey."
00:26:57.950,00:26:59.659,Mm. Enchanté.
00:27:06.542,00:27:08.668,And that's Nimrod.
00:27:08.710,00:27:10.796,Let's make a fort!
00:27:10.837,00:27:11.880,"Oh, fort! Cool!"
00:27:11.922,00:27:15.008,"Oh, Billy, uh, the cushions..."
00:27:15.050,00:27:17.094,That's a great idea for... fort building.
00:27:17.136,00:27:21.890,"AMANDA: I got to tell you, you have officially raised the birthday present bar to a whole new level."
00:27:23.183,00:27:25.102,"How did you find them, anyway?"
00:27:25.144,00:27:27.146,"Some sort of, I don't know, birthday penguin rental company?"
00:27:27.187,00:27:29.398,"Yeah, um..."
00:27:29.440,00:27:32.192,"No. Actually, Thom Senior."
00:27:33.986,00:27:36.071,Your-your dad?
00:27:36.113,00:27:38.073,"Wait, you-you saw him?"
00:27:38.115,00:27:39.325,H-How is he?
00:27:39.366,00:27:40.867,"Oh, he passed away."
00:27:40.909,00:27:42.620,"As in, he's dead?"
00:27:42.660,00:27:48.125,Yeah. He broke on through to the other side.
00:27:48.167,00:27:50.586,Are you okay?
00:27:50.628,00:27:52.421,"Yeah, I'm fine."
00:27:52.463,00:27:53.713,You're fine.
00:27:53.755,00:27:54.798,Mm.
00:27:54.840,00:27:56.800,Fine. I'm good.
00:27:56.842,00:27:58.302,And he left me those.
00:27:58.344,00:27:59.553,"Hey, where you going?"
00:27:59.595,00:28:00.804,Come back here.
00:28:05.184,00:28:06.560,You look great.
00:28:06.602,00:28:08.728,That's a nice cake.
00:28:06.602,00:28:10.147,Thanks. I should get the cake in the... Oh!
00:28:10.189,00:28:11.773,What?!
00:28:13.942,00:28:15.528,"Oh, my God!"
00:28:15.569,00:28:17.695,Aw... how cute.
00:28:17.737,00:28:19.739,It looks like they're nesting.
00:28:19.781,00:28:21.741,You finally have something in your fridge.
00:28:23.536,00:28:24.953,Yeah?
00:28:24.995,00:28:25.871,Thomas Popper?
00:28:25.912,00:28:28.374,"Nat Jones, New York Zoo."
00:28:28.415,00:28:29.875,Flightless Bird Division.
00:28:29.916,00:28:32.961,"Your assistant called, the one with the P problem."
00:28:33.003,00:28:35.088,I'm here for the penguin.
00:28:35.130,00:28:37.090,"Oh, wow."
00:28:37.132,00:28:38.925,She didn't tell me they were gentoos.
00:28:38.967,00:28:39.885,How many do you have?
00:28:39.926,00:28:41.428,Five?
00:28:41.470,00:28:43.138,"Six? Oh, God, even better."
00:28:43.180,00:28:45.098,AMANDA: What's going on?
00:28:45.140,00:28:46.350,I'll take care of it.
00:28:46.392,00:28:48.185,"Hey, save me a piece of that. Mmm!"
00:28:49.228,00:28:52.981,"I've got my team downstairs, and a fully equipped retrieval van."
00:28:53.023,00:28:54.608,"Yeah, that's great."
00:28:53.023,00:28:56.776,"But listen, uh, you can't actually take the penguins right now."
00:28:56.818,00:28:57.944,What are you talking about?
00:28:57.986,00:29:00.072,"Believe me, I'd love to give them to you."
00:29:00.113,00:29:01.865,"But it's my kid's birthday, and he's crazy about them."
00:29:01.907,00:29:02.866,You know kids.
00:29:02.908,00:29:04.076,I don't know kids.
00:29:04.117,00:29:05.202,I know penguins.
00:29:05.244,00:29:06.786,"They like ice, snow and fish."
00:29:06.828,00:29:12.585,"Put them in a New York apartment, they're gonna get beak rash and wing mange faster than you can blow out your birthday candles."
00:29:12.626,00:29:14.086,Wing mange?
00:29:14.127,00:29:15.754,Those animals belong in a zoo.
00:29:15.795,00:29:18.131,"Hey, I get it. I just have to take care of the politics."
00:29:18.173,00:29:20.342,"Mr. Popper, don't postpone the inevitable."
00:29:20.384,00:29:22.844,Give me the birds.
00:29:22.886,00:29:24.888,Just not right now.
00:29:24.930,00:29:27.057,Yeah? Soon.
00:29:29.393,00:29:30.810,Hey.
00:29:30.852,00:29:32.104,It's me.
00:29:32.145,00:29:35.065,"He's got six of them, and they're gentoos."
00:29:35.107,00:29:37.401,"Not yet, but I'll get them."
00:29:37.443,00:29:39.069,What was that?
00:29:37.443,00:29:41.071,"What did that man mean, I'm here for the penguins?"
00:29:41.113,00:29:43.115,"Oh, that guy?"
00:29:43.156,00:29:45.075,"He's here for, uh, their baths."
00:29:45.117,00:29:46.159,He's the bather.
00:29:45.117,00:29:47.536,"Trust me, you're gonna want them bathed."
00:29:47.578,00:29:49.329,I just told him to come back later...
00:29:49.371,00:29:50.956,'cause we're in the middle of a part-ay!
00:29:50.997,00:29:53.166,"They're mine, right?"
00:29:53.208,00:29:55.294,You kidding me?
00:29:55.335,00:29:56.503,"JANIE: I don't know, Billy."
00:29:56.545,00:29:59.339,I'd make him promise if I were you.
00:30:00.090,00:30:02.092,"Do you promise me, Popper?"
00:30:02.134,00:30:03.843,Yes.
00:30:03.885,00:30:05.512,JANIE: Say the words.
00:30:05.554,00:30:06.846,You don't want to disappoint them.
00:30:06.888,00:30:08.515,When did I ever disappoint anybody?
00:30:08.557,00:30:10.684,Father-son picnic.
00:30:11.893,00:30:13.479,I promise.
00:30:20.778,00:30:22.321,BILLY: Can we come over again tomorrow night?
00:30:22.362,00:30:23.489,POPPER: Really?
00:30:23.530,00:30:25.865,"Yeah. How about you, Janie, you, too?"
00:30:25.907,00:30:28.076,"Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be too bad."
00:30:28.118,00:30:29.953,"What do you think, buzzkill?"
00:30:29.995,00:30:32.122,A night to myself?
00:30:32.164,00:30:34.583,"Thanks, Dad."
00:30:37.919,00:30:39.463,It's a nice night.
00:30:39.505,00:30:41.214,Yeah.
00:30:43.133,00:30:45.093,want to come over.
00:30:45.135,00:30:46.886,Who gives a rat's butt?
00:30:46.928,00:30:49.515,Fair enough.
00:30:54.144,00:30:56.522,People love the sounds of nature.
00:30:56.563,00:30:58.148,Helps them sleep.
00:30:58.190,00:30:59.692,It's beautiful.
00:30:59.733,00:31:01.067,It's natural.
00:31:05.489,00:31:07.574,POPPER: Excuse me? Excuse me? Hey!
00:31:07.616,00:31:10.327,Yeah. Good.
00:31:10.369,00:31:12.912,"Now, shut up and go to sleep."
00:31:12.954,00:31:15.040,Or I'll give you something to honk about.
00:31:40.982,00:31:41.941,"All right, back off."
00:31:41.983,00:31:43.527,Spread out. Seriously.
00:31:43.569,00:31:45.278,I'm used to living alone.
00:31:45.320,00:31:46.946,No! Expensive.
00:31:46.988,00:31:49.282,Ooh! Aah!
00:31:52.411,00:31:55.873,"POPPER: Hey, that's my remote, Pecky Peckerton."
00:32:03.714,00:32:05.716,POPPER: Huh.
00:32:07.342,00:32:09.636,"You like that, huh?"
00:32:09.678,00:32:11.054,"He's funny, right?"
00:32:11.096,00:32:13.891,Kind of like a penguin.
00:32:21.481,00:32:24.984,Good. That'll loop all day.
00:32:27.028,00:32:29.989,POPPER: I suppose it's a formal event.
00:32:30.031,00:32:32.033,"Popper, where have you been?"
00:32:32.075,00:32:32.992,"Hey-hey, guys!"
00:32:33.034,00:32:34.912,We talked to Van Gundy's people.
00:32:34.953,00:32:36.663,They say she turned you down flat.
00:32:36.705,00:32:37.997,"Fellas, calm down."
00:32:38.039,00:32:39.416,Life's too short.
00:32:39.458,00:32:40.500,Especially for Franklin.
00:32:40.542,00:32:42.210,We thought we could trust you with this.
00:32:42.252,00:32:44.671,"Hey, Taming of the Shrew is not a one-act play."
00:32:44.713,00:32:48.634,You know that she's the chair of several charitable foundations?
00:32:48.675,00:32:52.011,One of those foundations is having a benefit at the Guggenheim Saturday.
00:32:52.053,00:32:53.430,And Mr. Popper will be present.
00:32:53.472,00:32:55.014,POPPER: I figured it out.
00:32:55.056,00:32:57.309,She's looking for somebody with integrity and character.
00:32:57.350,00:32:58.769,Somebody like Jimmy Stewart.
00:32:58.811,00:33:03.774,"And... doggone it, that's exactly what I'm gonna be."
00:33:03.816,00:33:05.901,"I'll use my own voice, though."
00:33:05.943,00:33:07.026,Although that was uncanny.
00:33:07.068,00:33:08.779,"Come on, give it to me."
00:33:08.821,00:33:15.034,"We expect some results, Popper, and until we get them, you can keep your name off my marble slab."
00:33:15.076,00:33:18.330,A man your age shouldn't be talking about marble slabs.
00:33:18.371,00:33:20.332,I got this.
00:33:20.373,00:33:23.042,"Penguins, Pippi."
00:33:23.084,00:33:26.045,"Per your predicament, I printed a pertinent page from Wikipedia."
00:33:26.087,00:33:31.050,Gentoo penguins may periodically imprint on a particular person as if they were a penguin.
00:33:31.092,00:33:35.054,"Once imprinted, they remain permanently proximate to their parental proxy."
00:33:35.096,00:33:36.055,Is it actually written that way?
00:33:36.097,00:33:38.057,I'm paraphrasing.
00:33:38.099,00:33:41.060,"They're imprinting, all right."
00:33:41.102,00:33:43.062,Uncanny tracking ability.
00:33:43.104,00:33:45.106,Can locate each other at great distance.
00:33:45.148,00:33:47.066,What about keeping them in line?
00:33:47.108,00:33:51.404,Are more docile when kept at lower temperatures.
00:33:51.446,00:33:54.073,Hmm.
00:33:54.115,00:33:55.701,POPPER: Cold enough for you?
00:33:55.742,00:33:57.076,Glad you're comfortable. Ow!
00:33:57.118,00:33:59.913,"Hey! This is a finger, this is a fish."
00:33:59.955,00:34:01.289,Learn to tell the difference.
00:34:01.331,00:34:02.875,"Ow, ow!"
00:34:04.292,00:34:06.085,"POPPER: Hey, kids."
00:34:06.127,00:34:07.086,"This is nice, huh?"
00:34:07.128,00:34:09.255,Little fresh air.
00:34:09.297,00:34:10.966,It's not bad if you keep moving.
00:34:11.008,00:34:13.051,Captain! Bitey! Stinky!
00:34:13.092,00:34:16.137,"Penguins need it cold, otherwise they get wing mange."
00:34:16.179,00:34:18.097,"Dad, are you okay?"
00:34:18.139,00:34:20.017,Yeah. Never better.
00:34:20.058,00:34:22.101,Let's take the penguins to the park!
00:34:22.143,00:34:24.103,"Billy, no."
00:34:24.145,00:34:25.480,Ah...
00:34:25.522,00:34:28.859,"You know, maybe they are a little cooped up in here."
00:34:33.154,00:34:35.741,"POPPER: Oy, look at all this space!"
00:34:35.782,00:34:38.618,to spread out and explore!
00:34:38.660,00:34:40.412,Get lost for a while!
00:34:58.764,00:35:00.849,Flight envy? Really?
00:35:00.891,00:35:02.601,That's hilarious!
00:35:02.642,00:35:06.312,"I hate to break it to you, Captain, but those are fins."
00:35:06.354,00:35:08.523,I think you might be more fish than fowl.
00:35:08.565,00:35:10.233,"BILLY: Hey, Dad!"
00:35:10.275,00:35:11.610,Hm.
00:35:11.651,00:35:13.403,"Oh, I see how it's gonna be."
00:35:13.445,00:35:15.948,"All right, let's see what you got, Billy!"
00:35:15.989,00:35:17.616,POPPER: All right!
00:35:17.657,00:35:19.826,"Come on, Janie!"
00:35:19.868,00:35:21.536,"Come on, let's get a game going."
00:35:21.578,00:35:23.162,"Thanks, but no thanks."
00:35:23.204,00:35:25.290,"Aw, come on!"
00:35:25.331,00:35:27.166,Little Popper over to Big Popper.
00:35:27.208,00:35:29.502,Looking for the flick-on.
00:35:29.544,00:35:31.379,Back to Little Pop... Oh!
00:35:31.421,00:35:34.215,"Nimrod blocks it over to Loudy, who dribbles it..."
00:35:34.257,00:35:36.217,Oh! Flagrant flatulation.
00:35:36.259,00:35:37.469,Could be a yellow card.
00:35:37.510,00:35:41.139,"Lovey controls, beaks it over to Billy, who bends it like Bitey!"
00:35:41.180,00:35:42.140,Oh!
00:35:42.181,00:35:44.183,Uh-oh. Better pick it up.
00:35:44.225,00:35:45.644,"Come on, Janie."
00:35:45.685,00:35:48.187,What're you afraid of?
00:35:48.229,00:35:52.191,"O-M-G, I'm too A-D-D to play with D-A-D."
00:35:52.233,00:35:54.152,Frowny Face.
00:35:55.194,00:35:56.822,Fine.
00:35:56.863,00:35:58.698,All right!
00:35:58.740,00:36:01.200,"You know, I heard that girls are the weaker sex."
00:36:01.242,00:36:03.078,"Didn't you hear that, Billy?"
00:36:04.121,00:36:05.204,Are you okay?
00:36:14.255,00:36:16.800,"JANIE: Sorry, Dad."
00:36:16.842,00:36:19.427,"Yeah, I get it-- you both have power shots."
00:36:19.469,00:36:20.804,Mr. Popper.
00:36:20.846,00:36:22.014,"Hey, guess what?"
00:36:22.055,00:36:23.473,I got new contact lenses.
00:36:23.515,00:36:25.308,"I.E., I can see more now."
00:36:25.350,00:36:27.060,I.E....
00:36:27.102,00:36:30.147,I can still see your six illegal pets.
00:36:32.149,00:36:33.608,"POPPER: We cool now, Hawkeye?"
00:36:33.650,00:36:36.111,"Let's go, kids."
00:36:45.328,00:36:47.246,"AMANDA: Hey, everybody."
00:36:47.288,00:36:49.248,I found him in the lobby.
00:36:49.290,00:36:50.583,"Oh, oops."
00:36:50.625,00:36:54.253,Mm-hmm. I figured it was like that time you lost Janie at Macy's.
00:36:54.295,00:36:55.588,You lost me?
00:36:55.630,00:36:57.215,You were never lost.
00:36:57.256,00:36:59.926,I simply failed to maintain visual contact.
00:36:59.968,00:37:02.929,It was less than an hour.
00:37:06.224,00:37:08.393,They're liking it here.
00:37:08.434,00:37:10.062,You want to keep them overnight?
00:37:10.103,00:37:11.270,Really?
00:37:11.312,00:37:12.271,Cool.
00:37:12.313,00:37:14.315,"And, uh, Rick and I are celebrating."
00:37:14.357,00:37:16.275,You got the grant.
00:37:16.317,00:37:18.070,Wow.
00:37:18.111,00:37:19.278,I'm really happy for you.
00:37:19.320,00:37:20.488,Thank you.
00:37:20.530,00:37:24.076,"You know, I was, uh, planning on having them stay at Mom's when we're in Ghana."
00:37:24.117,00:37:27.495,"Oh, you're actually going to Ghana, then."
00:37:27.537,00:37:29.247,Just for three weeks.
00:37:29.288,00:37:32.084,Maybe they could spend a few nights with you.
00:37:32.125,00:37:34.293,"Hey, kids, want to stay the night with your dad?"
00:37:34.335,00:37:35.503,Yeah!
00:37:35.545,00:37:37.255,AMANDA: Okay.
00:37:39.132,00:37:41.593,Good night.
00:37:41.634,00:37:44.303,"Good night, Mommy."
00:37:45.388,00:37:46.890,Good night. Oh.
00:37:51.269,00:37:53.271,"You, too, Loudy."
00:37:54.355,00:37:56.816,Bye.
00:37:58.317,00:38:00.695,You like Mom.
00:38:00.737,00:38:02.739,I do not.
00:38:04.241,00:38:05.992,"I mean, I like her."
00:38:06.034,00:38:07.326,I don't know if she likes me.
00:38:07.368,00:38:10.329,Does she talk about me?
00:38:10.371,00:38:12.082,You're acting weird.
00:38:12.124,00:38:16.294,"Oh, look, this is my favorite part right here."
00:38:23.051,00:38:26.763,"PIPPI: Mr. Popper, I purchased the special champagne per your request."
00:38:26.805,00:38:29.099,Good. Everything needs to be clockwork at the Guggenheim.
00:38:29.141,00:38:31.101,This could be our last chance with Van Gundy.
00:38:31.143,00:38:33.019,And should I be procuring a babysitter?
00:38:33.061,00:38:34.271,Yeahbsolutely.
00:38:34.312,00:38:36.355,"POPPER: So, we're talking standard hours."
00:38:36.397,00:38:37.690,A little light housekeeping.
00:38:37.732,00:38:40.068,"And, uh, you might want to do that coat up."
00:38:40.110,00:38:41.861,Catch your death in there.
00:38:41.903,00:38:44.239,"But, uh, as far as the, uh..."
00:38:44.281,00:38:46.074,"when you're taking care of, uh..."
00:38:46.116,00:38:48.534,Just plunk them in front of the TV.
00:38:48.576,00:38:49.744,Perfect.
00:38:49.786,00:38:51.370,"So, should we meet the kids?"
00:38:51.412,00:38:52.622,Sure. Yeah.
00:38:52.664,00:38:54.457,Come on over.
00:38:54.499,00:38:56.084,Here they are.
00:39:00.005,00:39:03.216,"So, you'll be home by 10:00?"
00:39:03.258,00:39:04.676,At the latest.
00:39:04.717,00:39:06.385,Just keep the Chaplin movies going.
00:39:06.427,00:39:08.596,They'll zone right out.
00:39:30.451,00:39:32.829,"NANNY: Hello, Mr. Popper."
00:39:32.871,00:39:34.831,You are worried like no mother.
00:39:34.873,00:39:36.291,It is adorable.
00:39:36.333,00:39:37.292,"Yeah, I know."
00:39:37.334,00:39:39.085,"Okay, turning my phone off."
00:39:39.127,00:39:42.088,Okay. Good night.
00:40:03.818,00:40:07.780,"I'm hearing shrieking, cackling, and trumpeting sounds coming from that apartment."
00:40:07.822,00:40:12.077,"Now, either Mr. Popper's hanging out with my mother, or I'm losing my mind."
00:40:12.118,00:40:13.619,"No, you're-you're definitely..."
00:40:13.661,00:40:16.956,"I am telling you, that man is up to something."
00:40:16.998,00:40:19.458,I hear the pitter-patter of floppy feet coming from inside that apartment.
00:40:19.500,00:40:21.294,I feel like I can hear them now.
00:40:21.336,00:40:25.798,"Sorry, Kent, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. Popper is an ideal tenant."
00:40:45.110,00:40:46.485,Bubbly.
00:40:46.527,00:40:48.154,Where's the target?
00:40:48.196,00:40:51.490,"Up there, proximate to the Pissarro painting."
00:40:51.532,00:40:53.451,You look pretty.
00:41:22.021,00:41:25.400,"So she never did see the flowers, and they were so..."
00:41:25.442,00:41:27.026,What a pleasant surprise.
00:41:27.068,00:41:28.445,"Oh, Mr. Popper."
00:41:28.486,00:41:30.071,I wish I could say the same.
00:41:31.572,00:41:33.158,You're dry. I like that.
00:41:33.199,00:41:34.367,"Oh, please."
00:41:34.409,00:41:37.787,Mrs. Van Gundy only drinks Krug.
00:41:41.582,00:41:43.042,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:47.422,00:41:48.547,May I?
00:41:48.589,00:41:51.926,1992?!
00:41:51.968,00:41:53.552,I'll take the free stuff.
00:41:53.594,00:41:55.972,MAN: Selma!
00:41:56.014,00:41:57.556,"TERRENCE: Congratulations, Selma."
00:41:57.598,00:41:58.850,Everything's impeccable.
00:41:58.891,00:42:00.143,"VAN GUNDY: Oh, thank you."
00:42:00.185,00:42:02.979,1992. Ghastly vintage.
00:42:03.021,00:42:04.563,I'll take the free stuff.
00:42:04.605,00:42:06.565,Terrence!
00:42:12.989,00:42:15.033,Stay in the game.
00:42:30.256,00:42:33.592,POPPER: Hmm. I bet there's a giant sentence somewhere looking for an ending.
00:42:33.634,00:42:40.975,"Mr. Popper, if you're trying to convince me to sell you the Tavern, I'm afraid you're wasting your time."
00:42:41.017,00:42:43.728,"Well, let's not talk about the Tavern, 'cause that's not why I'm here."
00:42:43.769,00:42:45.980,"Mrs. Van Gundy, you want to know what I'm worth."
00:42:46.022,00:42:47.357,I get that.
00:42:47.399,00:42:51.610,"Mr. Popper, this is the premier cultural event of the season."
00:42:51.652,00:42:53.612,I've organized this evening very precisely.
00:42:55.365,00:42:59.160,"And I can't have anything disrupting it, especially you."
00:42:59.202,00:43:02.372,"Now, one might think you would have realized that by now."
00:43:02.414,00:43:04.707,Oh! Wow!
00:43:04.749,00:43:07.585,What a beautiful piece of music they're playing down there.
00:43:07.626,00:43:09.587,May I have this dance down there?
00:43:09.628,00:43:10.963,"You're tenacious, Popper."
00:43:11.005,00:43:13.007,I'll give you that.
00:43:13.049,00:43:14.426,I hope you can keep up with me.
00:43:14.467,00:43:15.634,"Yeah, well, let's hurry."
00:43:15.676,00:43:17.345,We're missing it.
00:43:17.387,00:43:19.764,Here you go.
00:43:25.144,00:43:26.521,WOMAN: Are those penguins?
00:43:26.563,00:43:28.440,MAN: Hmm.
00:43:28.481,00:43:30.358,"Anyway, if you take Burma..."
00:43:44.663,00:43:46.082,Whoa!
00:44:02.932,00:44:04.892,What is that noise?
00:44:04.934,00:44:06.394,Popper!
00:44:06.436,00:44:07.979,It's nothing. Stay focused.
00:44:08.020,00:44:09.730,Whoa!
00:44:28.749,00:44:30.418,Ow! Hey! Hey!
00:44:31.210,00:44:33.588,Get it off me.
00:44:33.630,00:44:37.091,Who's responsible for this?
00:44:37.133,00:44:38.884,My money's on her.
00:44:38.926,00:44:42.013,Ugh! Is this some kind of environmentalist protest?
00:44:46.142,00:44:47.977,VAN GUNDY: This is disgraceful.
00:44:48.019,00:44:50.480,"Oh, don't lie to me."
00:44:51.564,00:44:52.649,Hmm?
00:44:55.776,00:44:57.694,Huh.
00:45:00.031,00:45:02.617,POPPER: I don't like you.
00:45:02.659,00:45:04.661,I don't want you in my life!
00:45:05.786,00:45:07.163,Come on.
00:45:13.628,00:45:16.297,This guy's a complete amateur.
00:45:16.339,00:45:20.926,"I just got to pick my moment, then make my move."
00:45:20.968,00:45:24.013,"POPPER: Pippi, the Guggenheim was a fiasco."
00:45:24.055,00:45:26.765,Get me another meeting with Van Gundy.
00:45:26.807,00:45:27.766,Pronto.
00:45:27.808,00:45:29.726,I was going to say that.
00:45:30.811,00:45:32.771,"Hey, Dad, come play hide-and-seek."
00:45:32.813,00:45:34.607,Captain's it.
00:45:34.649,00:45:37.360,I am still not speaking to them.
00:45:38.986,00:45:40.946,What? What happened?
00:45:40.988,00:45:42.948,I'm fine.
00:45:42.990,00:45:44.576,"Billy, it's time to go."
00:45:44.617,00:45:45.993,"Janie, what happened?"
00:45:46.035,00:45:47.078,I said I'm fine.
00:45:47.119,00:45:51.790,"Hey, I know I kind of blew it before, but I'm actually pretty good at giving advice, you know."
00:45:51.832,00:45:52.958,Mom's here. We gotta go.
00:45:54.669,00:45:57.422,"Janie, come on."
00:45:57.463,00:45:58.964,Really? Fine.
00:45:59.006,00:46:00.799,Here it is.
00:46:00.841,00:46:03.010,Madison broke up with Cooper Keegan to go out with Brandon Yee.
00:46:03.052,00:46:05.096,Brandy.
00:46:03.052,00:46:08.807,"So Cooper texted Brittany to see if I was going to the Snowball Dance, and she's all, No, she's not going."
00:46:08.849,00:46:11.561,"So, now, I look all desperate and dumb."
00:46:11.603,00:46:12.853,"So great, right?"
00:46:12.895,00:46:18.109,"Cooper's going to ask me to the Snowball Dance, but he never calls, and now Brittany's telling everybody that Madison kissed him in the third period."
00:46:18.150,00:46:21.820,"But then I hear that Brittany likes him, too, so I don't know what to think."
00:46:21.862,00:46:24.073,"What do you got, Dad?"
00:46:24.115,00:46:26.200,Well... who's Brittany again?
00:46:26.242,00:46:27.744,Ugh!
00:46:27.784,00:46:29.995,Brittany is Madison's BFF.
00:46:30.037,00:46:31.914,"Madison's big, fat friend."
00:46:31.956,00:46:33.708,Janie!
00:46:33.750,00:46:34.875,Hold on. Hold on.
00:46:34.917,00:46:36.168,Janie.
00:46:36.210,00:46:37.962,"Look, sweetheart."
00:46:38.003,00:46:40.339,Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.

00:47:08.951,00:47:11.704,"Well, you know, maybe she doesn't want advice."
00:47:11.746,00:47:14.957,Maybe she just wants you to be her dad and listen.
00:47:14.999,00:47:17.084,But what if my advice is amazing?
00:47:17.126,00:47:19.086,"Good night, Popper."

00:54:35.271,00:54:37.315,It's got sort of a decaying charm.

00:54:43.363,00:54:44.448,What?

00:55:04.093,00:55:08.097,It was about the only time I ever got to see him.

00:55:18.356,00:55:24.113,"We were married for 15 years, and you have never told me that."
00:55:24.155,00:55:25.239,Hmm.
00:55:25.281,00:55:29.243,"You are a complicated man, Mr. Popper."
00:55:33.413,00:55:35.207,I don't know.
00:55:35.249,00:55:37.001,I think this old place has still got it.
00:55:39.461,00:55:40.963,Where are we going?
00:55:41.005,00:55:43.381,That's for me to know and you to find adorable.

00:55:56.061,00:55:58.772,Nice trick.
00:55:58.814,00:56:01.441,"Oh, I can't believe we're doing this."
00:56:02.442,00:56:05.154,"I brought a girl here once, long time ago."
00:56:05.196,00:56:07.405,"It was closed, so we broke in and stole skates."
00:56:07.447,00:56:08.949,"Oh, she sounds amazing."
00:56:08.991,00:56:11.035,I thought so.
00:56:11.076,00:56:13.996,"Then she got on the ice, and she was kind of a spaz."
00:56:15.455,00:56:17.415,I think she was just trying to impress you.
00:56:17.457,00:56:18.834,You remember the boathouse?
00:56:18.876,00:56:21.377,"Oh, the boathouse."
00:56:21.419,00:56:23.421,"Yeah, it was surprisingly warm in there."

00:56:48.239,00:56:50.199,"NAT: Oh, there you go-- oh, that's good."

00:57:06.422,00:57:08.175,Yeah?
00:57:06.422,00:57:11.178,"Well, if I get worked up, you're gonna need a workup of your fizzace."

00:57:12.221,00:57:14.848,"You've got some interesting ideas about animal care, Mr. Popper."
00:57:14.890,00:57:16.850,You stick them in front of the TV?
00:57:16.892,00:57:19.770,"Yeah, Chaplin-- a classic."
00:57:19.811,00:57:22.814,You've got one nesting in the produce bin of your refrigerator.
00:57:24.566,00:57:26.235,Just shows what you know.
00:57:26.277,00:57:27.485,That's a cheese drawer.
00:57:27.527,00:57:30.739,Fish fillet sandwich with tartar sauce?
00:57:30.781,00:57:32.991,Is this your idea of a healthy animal diet?
00:57:33.033,00:57:34.285,"Ooh, evidence."
00:57:34.326,00:57:35.994,Call CSI.
00:57:36.036,00:57:37.996,You planted this.
00:57:38.038,00:57:40.207,You have no idea what you're doing with these birds.
00:57:40.249,00:57:42.584,"Oh, like you're some kind of penguin expert."
00:57:42.626,00:57:44.711,I am a penguin expert.
00:57:44.753,00:57:47.965,"Yeah, but..."
00:57:48.006,00:57:51.635,It's time for me to take these birds and put them in a proper home.
00:57:51.676,00:57:53.220,You aren't giving them what they need.
00:57:53.262,00:57:55.847,I am giving them exactly what they need.
00:57:55.889,00:57:56.848,What?
00:57:56.890,00:57:58.183,What are you giving them?
00:57:58.225,00:57:59.935,I am giving them love.
00:57:59.977,00:58:01.519,Love?
00:58:01.561,00:58:03.605,"Well, sounds weird when you make me say it."
00:58:03.647,00:58:06.566,"These aren't children, Mr. Popper, they're animals."
00:58:06.608,00:58:11.738,"They need food, they need snow, and every once in a while, one of them needs to be eaten by a whale."
00:58:11.780,00:58:14.199,Hey!
00:58:14.241,00:58:18.996,I'll tell you who they love-- whoever is holding the fish.
00:58:28.005,00:58:30.299,Traitors.
00:58:31.383,00:58:33.344,"Wake up, Popper."
00:58:33.385,00:58:40.976,"These penguins can only survive in a zoo or Antarctica, so sooner or later, I will take these penguins."
00:58:42.019,00:58:43.145,"POPPER: Omega-threes, Pip."
00:58:43.187,00:58:44.396,Penguins are way ahead of us on this.
00:58:44.438,00:58:45.563,"Mr. Popper, I'm perplexed."
00:58:45.605,00:58:47.983,How does this pertain to the Van Gundy problem?
00:58:48.025,00:58:48.942,Van Gundy?
00:58:48.984,00:58:50.735,"Oh, lots of that, lots of that."
00:58:50.777,00:58:52.570,Please tell me you have a plan.
00:58:52.612,00:58:54.990,"I always have a plan, Pippi."
00:58:56.033,00:58:57.575,They're fresh.
00:58:57.617,00:58:58.576,"Oh, really?"
00:58:58.618,00:59:00.787,"Well, why do I smell bleach?"
00:59:00.829,00:59:02.206,"Mr. Popper, we're being pressed for progress."
00:59:02.247,00:59:04.541,Perhaps I can pamper the penguins for you.
00:59:04.582,00:59:06.584,You-you need to procure your promotion.
00:59:06.626,00:59:10.588,"No, Pippi, what we need is squid, and plenty of them."
00:59:22.226,00:59:23.768,"Oh, morning, kids."
00:59:23.810,00:59:25.020,Babies on the way.
00:59:25.062,00:59:26.021,Got to get ready.
00:59:27.314,00:59:31.026,"Young gentoos need an ice shelf at 28 degrees, little powder on top."
00:59:31.068,00:59:33.362,"That's right, I'm kind of a penguin expert."
00:59:33.404,00:59:34.530,Oh!
00:59:34.571,00:59:36.614,"Hey, not in the house, young lady."
00:59:36.656,00:59:40.702,"Besides, when you pack this stuff down, you could really hurt somebody."
00:59:40.744,00:59:43.163,"Oh, okay."
00:59:48.460,00:59:50.212,"BILLY: Hey, Dad."
00:59:50.254,00:59:52.214,"Oh, you're begging for it, oh!"
00:59:52.256,00:59:53.631,"JANIE: Oh, Dad."
00:59:53.673,00:59:55.926,"Here, hold on-- oh, look how much can go in this hat."
00:59:55.967,00:59:57.594,Look how much can go in this hat!
00:59:57.635,00:59:58.636,Uh...
00:59:58.678,01:00:00.097,Uh-oh.
01:00:00.138,01:00:01.557,"Grab a pen, Popper."
01:00:01.598,01:00:04.768,I'm gonna hook you up with the number of a very good moving company.
01:00:10.566,01:00:11.900,Hey...
01:00:10.566,01:00:13.944,"Wow, I think I hear your mama calling."
01:00:13.985,01:00:16.405,"Kent, Kent."
01:00:17.697,01:00:19.991,"You're only delaying the inevitable, Popper."
01:00:20.033,01:00:21.910,I'll be telling the board about this.
01:00:25.080,01:00:27.124,"POPPER: Kids, wake up."
01:00:27.165,01:00:29.167,You don't want to miss this.
01:00:29.209,01:00:30.668,JANIE: What are we doing?
01:00:30.710,01:00:33.255,Shh.
01:00:34.256,01:00:36.091,Look.
01:00:37.134,01:00:41.555,"JANIE: Wow, cool."
01:00:48.061,01:00:51.106,It's so little.
01:00:51.148,01:00:53.150,BILLY: It's coming.
01:01:01.199,01:01:02.159,"Dad, look."
01:01:02.200,01:01:03.868,Yeah.
01:01:03.910,01:01:05.954,"BILLY: Oh, we have another one."
01:01:05.996,01:01:07.205,It's another one.
01:01:09.333,01:01:10.708,Reminds me of you guys.
01:01:18.925,01:01:20.969,Hmm.
01:01:24.222,01:01:26.724,Rangers on a breakaway!
01:01:26.766,01:01:27.976,They're out in the open ice.
01:01:28.018,01:01:29.144,"Oh, Crosby!"
01:01:29.186,01:01:30.812,There's nothing but daylight!
01:01:30.854,01:01:31.813,Can Crosby back-check?
01:01:31.855,01:01:32.814,Back-check!
01:01:32.856,01:01:33.982,"Oh, sorry."
01:01:34.024,01:01:34.983,"Hey, Dad."
01:01:35.025,01:01:36.985,"Oh, I got your number."
01:01:37.027,01:01:39.696,"JANIE: Ooh, I'm so scared."
01:01:40.905,01:01:41.906,"BILLY: Whoo, Dad!"
01:01:41.948,01:01:44.326,POPPER: Mom.
01:01:44.368,01:01:46.203,"The place is coming together, huh?"
01:01:46.244,01:01:47.371,Or apart.
01:01:47.412,01:01:52.000,"Captain's still waiting to be a dad, huh?"
01:01:52.042,01:01:55.170,"Yeah, that's right, a woman can be a captain."
01:01:55.212,01:01:56.921,We don't tolerate gender bias in this house.
01:01:56.963,01:01:58.173,"Oh, really?"
01:01:58.215,01:01:59.757,"Cross-checking's okay, though."
01:02:04.762,01:02:05.722,Five minutes for fighting.
01:02:05.763,01:02:06.973,"Oh, man."
01:02:07.015,01:02:08.725,You promise to call me when it hatches.
01:02:08.766,01:02:09.685,Promise.
01:02:09.726,01:02:11.728,Any day now.
01:02:19.027,01:02:20.487,"Don't worry, Captain."
01:02:22.030,01:02:24.700,Little fella's just taking his time.
01:02:24.741,01:02:26.076,And I bet he'll be a great flyer.
01:02:28.161,01:02:29.996,POPPER: You're falling asleep.
01:02:30.038,01:02:31.915,"No, I'm not."
01:02:31.956,01:02:34.792,"Hmm, must be me."
01:02:34.834,01:02:36.127,You really should go to bed.
01:02:36.169,01:02:37.754,Uh-uh.
01:02:37.795,01:02:39.797,I'm not leaving him.
01:02:39.839,01:02:40.882,He's a Popper.
01:02:42.467,01:02:44.802,Good night.
01:02:44.844,01:02:46.471,Good night.
01:02:58.525,01:02:59.859,"Oh, hey, guys."
01:02:59.901,01:03:02.362,We've left seven messages.
01:03:02.404,01:03:03.488,"You look terrible, Popper."
01:03:03.530,01:03:06.074,We haven't heard anything about the Tavern.
01:03:06.116,01:03:08.535,"Oh, well, um..."
01:03:08.577,01:03:11.580,"I'm sure Pippi told you, I've been kind of fighting a cold."
01:03:11.622,01:03:12.706,P-neumonia.
01:03:13.873,01:03:14.874,YATES: Move.
01:03:14.916,01:03:16.668,What the...?
01:03:16.710,01:03:20.088,"POPPER: If I'd have known you guys were coming, I'd have cleaned this place up."
01:03:20.130,01:03:24.384,the old Zamboni.
01:03:24.426,01:03:25.761,"Uh, yep."
01:03:25.802,01:03:27.804,Maid comes on Wednesdays.
01:03:31.891,01:03:32.850,He's gone insane.
01:03:32.892,01:03:34.311,FRANKLIN: I've seen this before.
01:03:34.352,01:03:36.104,This is exactly what happened with Howard Hughes.
01:03:36.146,01:03:37.855,'Cause you're old.
01:03:37.897,01:03:39.857,"YATES: Popper, the Tavern?"
01:03:39.899,01:03:40.900,"POPPER: Oh, the Tavern."
01:03:40.942,01:03:44.070,"Uh, the Tavern is an interesting project."
01:03:44.112,01:03:46.114,"Uh, I have lots of ideas about the Tavern."
01:03:46.156,01:03:47.991,I have one more...
01:03:46.156,01:03:49.951,"For God's sakes, man, pull yourself together."
01:03:49.993,01:03:51.953,Your house is full of penguins.
01:03:51.995,01:03:55.499,"I know, I know."
01:03:55.540,01:04:00.962,"I know how it looks, but it's just one more egg, and as soon as it hatches, I'm there."
01:04:01.004,01:04:03.881,"Franklin, how long have I worked for you?"
01:04:03.923,01:04:07.594,"You know how many soccer games I've skipped, and dance recitals?"
01:04:07.636,01:04:09.387,"I mean, what are we doing this for, anyway?"
01:04:13.600,01:04:15.893,There are just some things you can't afford to miss.
01:04:16.936,01:04:19.481,It's too late-- we've lost him.
01:04:19.523,01:04:21.483,"Popper, you're fired."
01:04:21.525,01:04:23.901,Okay.
01:04:26.404,01:04:29.907,"Best of luck in your future endeavors, Popper."
01:04:30.950,01:04:32.910,Appreciate it.
01:05:10.990,01:05:13.368,"Hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch..."
01:05:13.410,01:05:14.661,"Hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch, hatch..."
01:05:14.703,01:05:15.662,"Hatch, hatch, hatch."
01:05:15.704,01:05:17.581,Okay.
01:05:17.622,01:05:18.956,"It's gonna happen, I feel it."
01:05:18.998,01:05:22.252,"It's happening, happening right now, it's happening right now."
01:05:22.293,01:05:23.961,I'm gonna give it the touch.
01:05:24.003,01:05:26.506,"Total belief, total faith."
01:05:26.548,01:05:28.341,Come on.
01:05:35.014,01:05:36.974,Wow.
01:06:07.923,01:06:10.759,"I tried to warn you, Mr. Popper."
01:06:10.801,01:06:14.345,You're just not equipped for this.
01:06:14.387,01:06:17.974,Maybe you should let me take care of them for a while.
01:06:24.355,01:06:27.108,Hmm.
01:06:43.792,01:06:45.752,DEVELOPER: What if...
01:06:45.794,01:06:50.465,the Statue of Liberty...
01:06:50.507,01:06:54.469,"POPPER: Okay, people, no more loafing around."
01:06:54.511,01:06:57.096,"What's the matter, folks, you've never seen a zombie before?"
01:06:57.138,01:07:00.057,"That's right, it's the Dawn of the Dead."
01:07:00.099,01:07:01.852,I'm eating brains and taking names.
01:07:01.893,01:07:03.060,"Marshall, get zoning on the phone."
01:07:03.102,01:07:05.062,I want to know how soon we can break ground.
01:07:05.104,01:07:08.984,Remind them of our donation to the mayor's reelection fund.
01:07:09.066,01:07:11.110,"Boy, I never get tired of looking at New York from here."
01:07:11.152,01:07:12.946,Love what you've done with the place.
01:07:12.988,01:07:15.072,"Popper, what are you doing here?"
01:07:15.114,01:07:16.616,"I'm on a mission of mercy, Franklin."
01:07:16.658,01:07:18.075,I decided to take you back.
01:07:18.117,01:07:19.076,You're taking us back?
01:07:19.118,01:07:20.077,We fired you.
01:07:20.119,01:07:21.078,All's forgiven then.
01:07:21.120,01:07:22.079,Don't worry about it.
01:07:22.121,01:07:23.707,Let me bring you up to speed.
01:07:23.748,01:07:26.083,I've been playing hardball with Van Gundy.
01:07:26.125,01:07:28.085,Told her kids we were offering a hundred million dollars.
01:07:28.127,01:07:33.466,"Suggested they make her life difficult until she accepts, so they've all moved back home."
01:07:33.508,01:07:36.720,Mrs. Van Gundy has planned a press conference for tomorrow.
01:07:36.761,01:07:38.221,She wants us all present.
01:07:38.262,01:07:42.099,"If you'll excuse us, we have to unpack."
01:07:42.141,01:07:44.101,"Hmm, Popper's back!"
01:07:45.937,01:07:47.104,"POPPER: Oh, hey, guys."
01:07:47.146,01:07:48.105,"BILLY: Hey, Dad."
01:07:48.147,01:07:49.106,Hi.

01:07:50.066,01:07:51.150,"Yeah, Dad, are you okay?"
01:07:51.192,01:07:53.028,"Yeah, I'm fine."
01:07:53.069,01:07:59.075,"Oh, uh, before you go in there, uh, I think I should tell you, there's been a couple of changes."
01:08:08.167,01:08:10.086,BILLY: Where are they?
01:08:08.167,01:08:11.087,"They're okay, they're fine."
01:08:11.128,01:08:12.088,They're at the zoo.
01:08:12.129,01:08:13.130,And you know what?
01:08:13.172,01:08:14.257,It's really the best place for them.
01:08:14.298,01:08:18.929,"They're probably in an icy pool right now, all the fish they can eat, full-time penguin masseuse."
01:08:18.970,01:08:21.180,The whole thing's being narrated by Morgan Freeman.
01:08:21.222,01:08:23.433,You sent them away to some cage?
01:08:23.474,01:08:26.143,"Billy, they're birds."
01:08:26.185,01:08:28.479,They don't feel things the way we do.
01:08:28.521,01:08:30.147,"Don't bother, Mom."
01:08:30.189,01:08:31.315,"Come on, guys."
01:08:31.357,01:08:34.318,"We had fun, but it's time to get back to reality."
01:08:34.360,01:08:36.821,"We got soccer, we got the Snowball Dance."
01:08:36.863,01:08:38.114,I'm not going to the stupid Snowball Dance.
01:08:40.366,01:08:42.660,Cooper Keegan asked somebody else.
01:08:44.079,01:08:47.832,"Janie, sometimes boys are going to disappoint you."
01:08:47.874,01:08:51.252,I'm not disappointed in him.
01:08:51.294,01:08:53.504,BILLY: Janie.
01:08:57.884,01:08:59.176,What was I supposed to do?
01:08:59.218,01:09:01.012,How about feel something?
01:09:01.054,01:09:03.473,Oh... please.
01:09:03.514,01:09:06.059,I feel great.
01:09:06.101,01:09:07.727,I saw you with that egg.
01:09:07.769,01:09:09.104,I saw you.
01:09:09.145,01:09:10.187,That wasn't me.
01:09:10.229,01:09:17.821,"That was a dream where people live with penguins and the kids love them and all the eggs hatch, so wake up."
01:09:17.862,01:09:20.073,Wow.
01:09:22.241,01:09:24.201,I think I just did.
01:09:24.243,01:09:30.207,"Oh, and, uh, Rick wanted to extend the Ghana trip, turn it into a vacation."
01:09:30.249,01:09:32.752,"You okay with that, Popper?"
01:09:34.838,01:09:36.840,Yeahbsolutely.
01:09:57.652,01:09:58.987,POPPER: Pipsi-Cola.
01:09:59.029,01:10:01.614,"PIPPI: Mr. Popper, we're pulling up presently."
01:10:01.656,01:10:03.658,Okay.
01:10:05.284,01:10:07.244,Oh.
01:10:07.286,01:10:09.205,Come on.
01:10:32.311,01:10:39.986,"THOMAS POPPER SR.: My dearest Tommy, in all my travels I've never encountered a creature quite so wise as this."
01:10:40.028,01:10:43.198,"You see, once it loves you, it never leaves your side."
01:10:43.239,01:10:50.413,"I'm sorry, son, that it took me so long to learn that lesson, but I hope there's still time for you."
01:10:50.454,01:10:58.004,Give your little ones a hug from Grandpa and hold them as close as you can for as long as you can.
01:10:58.046,01:11:01.257,"Bald Eagle, over and out."
01:11:10.934,01:11:13.186,"All right, everybody in."
01:11:13.228,01:11:14.437,Let's go.
01:11:14.478,01:11:18.233,We don't want to go to your stupid press conference.
01:11:19.275,01:11:20.693,We're not going to the press conference.
01:11:20.735,01:11:21.694,Pardon?
01:11:21.736,01:11:24.114,"Driver, take us to the zoo."
01:11:24.155,01:11:25.698,We're getting our penguins back.
01:11:25.740,01:11:28.284,BOTH: Yes!
01:11:34.916,01:11:38.836,"Mr. Popper, late as usual."
01:11:40.088,01:11:41.422,Call him.
01:11:41.464,01:11:42.799,Who?
01:11:42.840,01:11:45.093,Cooper freaking Keegan.
01:11:45.135,01:11:46.177,"But, Dad..."
01:11:46.219,01:11:51.057,"Sweetie, you've got to put your heart out there, and it might get broken, but that's how you know you have one."
01:11:51.099,01:11:52.349,Call him.
01:11:52.391,01:11:55.853,"Dad, I don't even really like him anymore."
01:11:55.895,01:11:58.564,I just got the name down.
01:11:58.606,01:12:00.900,But thanks.
01:12:00.942,01:12:01.901,Call her.
01:12:01.943,01:12:03.360,Who?
01:12:03.402,01:12:05.029,Mom freaking Mom.
01:12:05.071,01:12:06.405,I don't really like her anymore.
01:12:06.447,01:12:07.406,I'm kidding.
01:12:07.448,01:12:09.117,Give me that.
01:12:20.419,01:12:21.629,"Hold on, sorry."
01:12:21.671,01:12:23.006,"Hey, Janie, what's up?"
01:12:23.047,01:12:24.381,"Amanda, hi."
01:12:24.423,01:12:31.597,"Look, um... I know this is a total Hail Mary, but please don't go to Ghana."
01:12:31.639,01:12:34.976,"Thom, are, are you kidding me right now?"
01:12:35.018,01:12:40.898,"If you go there with him, then it becomes a relationship, and... I'm not asking for you to just jump right back in with me."
01:12:40.940,01:12:42.900,I just want one more date.
01:12:42.942,01:12:46.654,Just stay and go on one more date with me.
01:12:48.198,01:12:50.200,Please.
01:12:52.285,01:12:54.245,"Long pauses are good, right?"
01:12:54.287,01:12:55.371,Means she's thinking?
01:12:57.456,01:13:01.460,"Where are you going to take me this time, Popper, another landmark you're planning to tear down?"
01:13:01.502,01:13:07.258,"No, the kids and I are going to visit some old friends."
01:13:19.478,01:13:21.981,"Two children, one adult."
01:13:22.023,01:13:23.066,AMANDA: Make that two adults.
01:13:23.107,01:13:25.193,"Mom, yes!"
01:13:25.235,01:13:26.443,Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
01:13:26.485,01:13:30.990,"It's just a second date, and it'd better be a good one."
01:13:31.032,01:13:32.449,POPPER: Yeahbsolutely.
01:13:31.032,01:13:33.826,"Okay, here we go."
01:13:37.080,01:13:39.957,"Okay, guys, we're here to get you..."
01:13:39.999,01:13:41.834,...out.
01:13:41.876,01:13:43.460,JANIE: They're not here.
01:13:43.502,01:13:45.046,AMANDA: These aren't our guys.
01:13:45.088,01:13:47.882,"No, they're not."
01:13:49.842,01:13:51.010,Where are my penguins?
01:13:51.052,01:13:52.011,I'm gonna call you back.
01:13:52.053,01:13:55.390,"Ah, Mr. Popper, they're not your penguins."
01:13:55.431,01:13:57.350,"Don't give us the runaround, slick."
01:13:57.392,01:13:58.559,Why aren't they out there?
01:13:58.601,01:14:00.978,Because we already have penguins.
01:14:01.020,01:14:06.859,What we don't have is an emu or a Komodo dragon or a Bengal tiger.
01:14:06.901,01:14:08.278,What are you talking about?
01:14:08.319,01:14:09.486,"Trading, Mr. Popper."
01:14:09.528,01:14:11.488,"Zoos do it all the time, same as sports teams."
01:14:11.530,01:14:14.951,How do you think the Yankees won 27 championships?
01:14:14.992,01:14:16.493,It sure wasn't their farm system.
01:14:16.535,01:14:17.995,Where are you sending them?
01:14:18.037,01:14:22.208,"Three to Washington, three to Tokyo, and the two chicks are going to Dubai."
01:14:22.250,01:14:23.459,But you can't split them up.
01:14:23.500,01:14:24.460,They're a family.
01:14:24.501,01:14:27.046,"God's sake, they're just birds."
01:14:27.088,01:14:28.256,Just birds?
01:14:28.298,01:14:29.924,And what about the American eagle?
01:14:29.966,01:14:31.592,Is that just a bird?
01:14:31.634,01:14:32.718,Yes.
01:14:32.760,01:14:35.221,"Okay, what about...?"
01:14:35.263,01:14:37.140,"Oh, Big Bird's a Muppet."
01:14:37.181,01:14:39.183,"Look, can they just see them?"
01:14:39.225,01:14:40.143,My kids are distraught.
01:14:40.184,01:14:41.518,"Right, Billy?"
01:14:41.560,01:14:45.064,Aw.
01:14:45.106,01:14:46.065,No.
01:14:46.107,01:14:49.485,"Children, this is what a liar looks like."
01:14:49.526,01:14:51.028,Take a mental picture.
01:14:51.070,01:14:54.073,"Look, Popper, I couldn't even if I wanted to."
01:14:54.115,01:14:55.074,They're already gone.
01:14:57.201,01:14:57.952,ALL: Loudy.
01:14:57.994,01:15:00.413,"AMANDA: Huh, you are a liar."
01:15:00.455,01:15:01.831,"Popper, Popper."
01:15:01.872,01:15:03.124,There you are.
01:15:03.166,01:15:04.125,Get back in there.
01:15:04.167,01:15:05.126,Ow.
01:15:05.168,01:15:07.378,"Bitey, good job."
01:15:07.420,01:15:10.173,"Mr. Popper, those penguins are going back in the tank."
01:15:10.214,01:15:11.341,"No, they're not."
01:15:11.382,01:15:12.925,"Oh, what do we have here?"
01:15:12.967,01:15:14.344,Anybody want some fish?
01:15:14.385,01:15:15.386,That's right.
01:15:15.428,01:15:18.555,"Come on in, come on, come on, come on, hey."
01:15:18.597,01:15:20.516,Not this time.
01:15:22.768,01:15:25.062,"Hmm, uh..."
01:15:25.104,01:15:28.065,Do you have some kind of a plan?
01:15:28.107,01:15:29.066,"I'm sorry, have we met?"
01:15:29.108,01:15:31.568,Come on.
01:15:34.613,01:15:35.614,What took you so long?
01:15:35.656,01:15:37.408,"Sorry, sir."
01:15:37.450,01:15:40.411,"Sir, what do the suspects look like?"
01:15:40.453,01:15:42.163,"Hmm, ah, let me think."
01:15:42.205,01:15:44.957,"Uh, they're the ones with the eight penguins."
01:15:44.999,01:15:46.583,Now seal all the exits!
01:15:46.625,01:15:48.378,"AMANDA: You guys have the babies, right?"
01:15:48.419,01:15:49.586,"JANIE: Yeah, Mom, we got them."
01:15:49.628,01:15:52.006,"Excuse us, avian infectious disease containment."
01:15:52.048,01:15:53.383,AMANDA: Antarctic bird flu.
01:15:53.424,01:15:54.591,POPPER: Very bad!
01:15:54.633,01:15:56.469,"Diarrhea, vomiting."
01:15:56.511,01:15:58.012,You might want to hold your breath.
01:15:58.054,01:16:00.597,AMANDA: Thank you for your cooperation.
01:16:00.639,01:16:02.141,This way.
01:16:04.185,01:16:05.936,"Oh, no."
01:16:05.978,01:16:06.979,"BILLY: Come on, guys, follow me, follow me."
01:16:07.021,01:16:08.939,"Okay, try to act normal."
01:16:32.796,01:16:34.631,There he is.
01:16:34.673,01:16:37.134,"Oh, okay, I'll get him on this side, this way."
01:16:37.176,01:16:38.635,"Oh, to the le-- to the left."
01:16:38.677,01:16:39.636,"No, just-- he's going up..."
01:16:39.678,01:16:41.097,Get him.
01:16:41.138,01:16:43.640,Don't let him in the elevator.
01:16:43.682,01:16:45.017,GIRL: That was fun.
01:16:43.682,01:16:46.643,"GUARD: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sorry, ma'am, you can't take this exit."
01:16:46.685,01:16:47.644,GIRL: But why?
01:16:47.686,01:16:48.645,"GUARD: No, no, not this way."
01:16:48.687,01:16:49.646,WOMAN: We came in this gate.
01:16:49.688,01:16:51.899,"Well, you're gonna have to use the north side exit."
01:16:51.941,01:16:54.944,"I'm sorry, sweetie, you're just gonna have to walk a little further, okay."
01:16:54.985,01:16:56.571,North side exit.
01:16:56.612,01:16:58.364,It's the north side exit; you can't go this way.
01:16:58.406,01:16:59.949,"Thank you, sorry for the inconvenience."
01:16:58.406,01:17:01.033,"Come on, honey, we're just gonna have to go around."
01:17:02.076,01:17:02.910,It's okay.
01:17:02.952,01:17:04.828,All right.
01:17:04.870,01:17:06.539,Miss.
01:17:06.581,01:17:10.667,"All right, nice and neat formation."
01:17:10.709,01:17:14.088,"Okay, stay in formation."
01:17:14.130,01:17:15.672,Remain calm.
01:17:15.714,01:17:16.799,What happened?
01:17:16.840,01:17:17.800,I was pricked by a porcupine.
01:17:17.841,01:17:19.093,Where were you pricked?
01:17:19.135,01:17:20.928,In my posterior.
01:17:20.970,01:17:22.138,POPPER: There's the limo.
01:17:22.179,01:17:23.680,Just stay in formation.
01:17:23.722,01:17:24.974,"NAT: I'm at the rear door, he's not there."
01:17:25.015,01:17:26.601,Hey!
01:17:26.642,01:17:27.602,Break formation!
01:17:27.643,01:17:29.103,Popper!
01:17:29.145,01:17:30.687,GUARD: No!
01:17:30.729,01:17:33.441,Halt!
01:17:35.276,01:17:39.029,"Ha-ha, you lose, slave trader."
01:17:39.071,01:17:40.197,"I don't think so, Popper."
01:17:40.239,01:17:41.698,Aren't you forgetting something?
01:17:41.740,01:17:43.659,"No, I don't think I'm forgetting something."
01:17:43.700,01:17:46.287,Thom...
01:17:46.329,01:17:48.872,"Okay, one thing I forgot."
01:17:48.914,01:17:51.083,CHILD: What's up on the roof?
01:17:51.125,01:17:52.960,"CHILD 2: I don't know, I see it, too."
01:17:53.002,01:17:54.711,He's so cute.
01:17:54.753,01:17:56.964,Captain.
01:17:57.006,01:17:58.966,Easy does it.
01:17:59.008,01:18:01.010,Nice and easy.
01:18:05.014,01:18:06.349,"POPPER: Captain, no!"
01:18:06.390,01:18:07.975,MAN: Whoa!
01:18:15.149,01:18:17.734,POPPER: She's doing it.
01:18:18.777,01:18:22.532,Captain's flying!
01:18:28.162,01:18:29.580,Whoo-hah!
01:18:34.043,01:18:36.003,POPPER: Whoa!
01:18:36.045,01:18:38.381,Can you believe that?
01:18:38.422,01:18:40.966,"hitting yourself, huh?"
01:18:41.008,01:18:42.968,Why are you hitting yourself?
01:18:43.010,01:18:44.094,That's not attractive for a zoo official.
01:18:44.136,01:18:45.095,Huh?
01:18:45.137,01:18:46.514,I'll tell you what.
01:18:47.682,01:18:50.351,Now you're trapped like an animal.
01:18:50.393,01:18:52.311,'Sironic.
01:18:52.353,01:18:55.064,"Hey, don't-- come back here!"
01:18:55.105,01:18:56.899,Come back!
01:18:56.940,01:18:59.860,Pretty good date so far.
01:18:59.902,01:19:01.778,"Driver, Tavern on the Green."
01:19:01.820,01:19:02.863,Ow!
01:19:02.905,01:19:05.074,"Pull that thing, pull it."
01:19:07.117,01:19:08.744,"Hey, hey, stop!"
01:19:12.540,01:19:18.421,"VAN GUNDY: There have been a lot of rumors floating around lately, and I'm here to clear them up."
01:19:18.462,01:19:28.055,"I have always said that I would only sell the Tavern if I found the right person, and that's why I'm here to announce..."
01:19:33.227,01:19:34.604,Don't...
01:19:34.645,01:19:36.813,do...
01:19:36.855,01:19:39.775,it.
01:19:41.860,01:19:43.862,Did you like that?
01:19:43.904,01:19:45.698,Just wanted to get your attention.
01:19:45.740,01:19:48.618,"Mrs. Van Gundy, you can't sell this place."
01:19:48.659,01:19:49.826,I know.
01:19:48.659,01:19:54.915,"If you sell it to me, I'll just tear it down, and then Freddy and Tito and Klaus and the guy that looks like Chef Boyardee will be out on the street."
01:19:54.957,01:19:57.876,I know.
01:19:57.918,01:19:59.545,It's a part of my history.
01:19:59.587,01:20:01.589,I came here with my father.
01:20:01.631,01:20:04.883,The other day I had the best second-first date a man could ever have.
01:20:04.925,01:20:15.852,"And I would rather cut my hands off and stick knives in my eyes than-- wait, I'd have to do the eyes first and then the hands, and I'd have to have somebody help me cut the right hand off because the left hand would be gone, really."
01:20:13.892,01:20:17.187,"Mr. Popper, stop talking."
01:20:17.229,01:20:18.981,Okay.
01:20:19.022,01:20:20.274,You're not?
01:20:20.316,01:20:21.776,Mm-mm.
01:20:21.817,01:20:23.611,"Glad we got dressed up, huh?"
01:20:23.653,01:20:24.820,"Oh, there he is."
01:20:26.029,01:20:27.072,"Excuse me, folks."
01:20:27.114,01:20:29.742,"Nat Jones, New York Zoo."
01:20:29.784,01:20:31.910,This man has been trafficking in stolen penguins.
01:20:31.952,01:20:35.456,even talking about from left field?
01:20:35.498,01:20:36.499,Penguins?
01:20:38.083,01:20:39.376,'Sabsurd.
01:20:40.753,01:20:42.879,"Uh, hmm, uh, no, no, no, no, no."
01:20:42.921,01:20:44.881,"Penguins, please."
01:20:44.923,01:20:45.924,"Hi, Pip."
01:20:45.966,01:20:47.677,Thought you were going to stay in the car.
01:20:47.718,01:20:48.927,They pecked the power locks.
01:20:48.969,01:20:50.763,Ah.
01:20:48.969,01:20:53.307,He has been keeping these defenseless creatures locked away in his apartment.
01:20:53.349,01:20:57.060,"When I tried to save them, he broke into the zoo and kidnapped them."
01:20:57.102,01:20:59.188,I've seen these penguins before.
01:20:59.229,01:21:00.897,"Is it true, Mr. Popper?"
01:21:00.939,01:21:02.899,"Yes, I'm afraid so."
01:21:02.941,01:21:04.109,Why'd you do it?
01:21:04.151,01:21:07.029,"Knowing you, it must be for some sort of personal gain."
01:21:07.070,01:21:09.906,"Yes, the kind no amount of money can buy."
01:21:09.948,01:21:11.074,"Oh, for Pete's sake."
01:21:11.116,01:21:14.911,Mr. Popper and his equally crazy family believe that these penguins love him.
01:21:14.953,01:21:15.912,They are wrong.
01:21:15.954,01:21:21.168,"If they have to choose between love and a nice juicy sardine, they'll choose the fish every time."
01:21:21.210,01:21:22.919,I don't think so.
01:21:22.961,01:21:25.589,Hm.
01:21:25.631,01:21:28.634,I got this.
01:21:39.562,01:21:41.938,"Come on, guys."
01:21:41.980,01:21:43.106,Come on.
01:21:46.694,01:21:47.944,NAT: Come on. Yeah.
01:21:47.986,01:21:49.279,That's right.
01:21:49.321,01:21:50.947,"Captain, come on."
01:21:50.989,01:21:52.491,Come to Popper.
01:21:56.328,01:21:58.955,Hey! That's my guys!
01:22:03.001,01:22:04.961,No! That doesn't prove anything.
01:22:05.003,01:22:06.296,Come on.
01:22:06.338,01:22:07.548,Aren't you gonna arrest him?
01:22:07.590,01:22:08.799,For what? Winning?
01:22:08.841,01:22:10.718,Is that what we do in this country?
01:22:10.760,01:22:11.968,Is that what America's all about?
01:22:12.010,01:22:15.890,I don't think so!
01:22:21.061,01:22:22.979,Have you people lost your mind?
01:22:23.021,01:22:24.022,He's breaking the law.
01:22:24.064,01:22:25.982,"OFFICER: Come on, guy, have a heart."
01:22:26.024,01:22:26.983,Have a heart?!
01:22:27.025,01:22:28.985,I'm gonna call the chief of police.
01:22:29.027,01:22:30.153,I'm gonna call the mayor!
01:22:30.195,01:22:31.947,"VAN GUNDY: Oh, allow me."
01:22:36.285,01:22:37.994,Michael?
01:22:38.036,01:22:39.162,What?
01:22:39.204,01:22:42.750,I've got a small matter that needs your attention.
01:22:42.792,01:22:44.000,OFFICER: Come on.
01:22:44.042,01:22:45.335,The penguins will be provided for.
01:22:45.377,01:22:47.671,Mr. Popper always has a plan.
01:22:47.713,01:22:49.047,This is insane!
01:22:49.089,01:22:51.091,"Quiet, you."
01:22:51.133,01:22:54.010,Pippi.
01:22:54.052,01:22:55.053,Pleasure.
01:22:55.095,01:22:57.013,Quite.
01:22:59.475,01:23:01.143,"Well, I guess we have custody."
01:23:01.184,01:23:03.019,I guess we do.
01:23:03.061,01:23:04.980,VAN GUNDY: Mr. Popper.
01:23:05.021,01:23:06.982,Mrs. Van Gundy.
01:23:07.023,01:23:08.901,Congratulations.
01:23:08.943,01:23:11.570,The Tavern is yours.
01:23:11.612,01:23:12.947,I told you.
01:23:14.615,01:23:17.033,forget a name.
01:23:17.075,01:23:23.248,I just needed to be sure that that little boy hadn't gotten lost somewhere.
01:23:23.290,01:23:25.918,"FRANKLIN: Nice work, Popper."
01:23:25.960,01:23:29.713,Hey... Franklin!
01:23:25.960,01:23:31.757,YATES: When do we break ground on the new building?
01:23:31.799,01:23:33.008,We're not.
01:23:34.092,01:23:37.053,W-What are you talking about?
01:24:20.556,01:24:22.516,"It's really beautiful, Thom."
01:24:22.558,01:24:23.642,Thank you.
01:24:23.684,01:24:25.101,"You did a great job, Dad."
01:24:25.143,01:24:26.520,"I appreciate that, Billy."
01:24:26.562,01:24:29.105,But it wasn't just me; I'm just the mastermind.
01:24:29.147,01:24:31.107,So...
01:24:31.149,01:24:35.111,I brought you here today because I want to tell you something.
01:24:35.153,01:24:41.076,"I'm going on a trip, very far away, and I could be gone for a very long time."
01:24:41.117,01:24:42.285,So...
01:24:42.327,01:24:45.330,I'm gonna need you to come with me.
01:24:45.372,01:24:47.917,Nice!
01:24:47.958,01:24:51.921,Where are we going?
01:24:53.338,01:24:56.299,"It's not, is it?"
01:25:06.685,01:25:08.395,Warm enough?
01:25:08.437,01:25:10.522,AMANDA: Perfect.
01:25:26.956,01:25:29.124,Whoa!
01:25:31.167,01:25:34.922,Will you look at that!
01:25:34.964,01:25:36.298,AMANDA: It's a family reunion!
01:25:36.339,01:25:38.300,"BILLY: Hey, look! It's the Loveys!"
01:25:38.341,01:25:40.176,And the Loudys!
01:25:40.218,01:25:43.138,POPPER: And the Nimrods.
01:25:51.229,01:25:55.150,"Hey, Dad, I don't think Captain likes it here."
01:26:00.238,01:26:02.198,"It's okay, girl."
01:26:02.240,01:26:04.326,"You just gotta get used to it, that's all."
01:26:05.661,01:26:07.203,"Oh, my."
01:26:07.245,01:26:09.205,I think she's gonna be just fine.
01:26:09.247,01:26:12.417,What should we name him?
01:26:12.459,01:26:16.463,"Well, he's gonna be an amazing flyer, so..."
01:26:16.505,01:26:18.632,how about...
01:26:18.674,01:26:20.216,Bald Eagle?
01:26:21.259,01:26:24.220,"Hey, he's a good reason to come back."
01:26:24.262,01:26:26.056,Yeah!
01:26:26.098,01:26:28.224,"You hear that, Captain?"
01:26:30.853,01:26:32.729,"Thank you, Captain."
01:26:32.771,01:26:36.232,You're the coolest gift I ever got.
01:26:37.985,01:26:39.235,See you soon.
01:26:39.277,01:26:40.612,"BILLY: Way to go, Captain."
01:26:40.654,01:26:42.238,You're going to be a great mom.
01:26:42.280,01:26:45.408,"JANIE: Yeah, and Loudy better be a good dad."
01:26:47.161,01:26:50.413,"Not bad, Popper, not bad."
01:26:52.124,01:26:54.084,Yeahbsolutely.
01:26:54.126,01:26:56.211,AMANDA: Mmm.
