00:00:26.193,00:00:28.403,of her head.
00:00:30.155,00:00:32.825,I picture cracking her lovely skull...
00:00:32.825,00:00:35.202,unspooling her brains...
00:00:35.202,00:00:39.247,trying to get answers.
00:00:39.247,00:00:42.417,The primal questions of any marriage.
00:00:42.417,00:00:44.879,What are you thinking?
00:00:44.879,00:00:47.214,How are you feeling?
00:00:47.214,00:00:49.591,What have we done to each other?
00:02:25.854,00:02:28.649,The Irish prince graces us with his presence.
00:02:30.651,00:02:33.612,His majesty prefers not to be moistened.
00:02:34.822,00:02:36.197,I got you a present.
00:02:36.197,00:02:37.908,Oh.
00:02:37.908,00:02:39.284,I hated this game.
00:02:39.284,00:02:40.702,You loved it.
00:02:40.702,00:02:43.789,Thank you.
00:02:43.789,00:02:45.833,Can you pour me a bourbon?
00:02:52.089,00:02:54.008,"What's up, Jitters?"
00:02:57.803,00:02:59.013,"Well, if you're not going to talk..."
00:02:59.013,00:03:00.472,I'm gonna have to fill the silence...
00:03:00.472,00:03:03.851,with another excruciating story by Margo Dunne.
00:03:03.851,00:03:06.520,I could tell you about my recent customer service experience...
00:03:06.520,00:03:08.563,changing Internet service providers.
00:03:08.563,00:03:10.231,Or how about the time...
00:03:10.231,00:03:11.441,I saw that woman who looked exactly like my friend Monica?
00:03:11.441,00:03:13.401,But it wasn't Monica.
00:03:13.401,00:03:15.863,Who was also named Monica.
00:03:15.863,00:03:17.072,Made it kind of interesting.
00:03:18.032,00:03:19.533,I'm just having a bad day.
00:03:19.533,00:03:21.535,Amy?
00:03:21.535,00:03:23.244,Five years.
00:03:23.244,00:03:24.538,That came fast.
00:03:24.538,00:03:25.789,And furious.
00:03:30.627,00:03:34.381,"AMY: I'm so crazy, stupid happy."
00:03:36.257,00:03:38.135,I met a boy.
00:03:38.135,00:03:42.222,"A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy."
00:03:44.474,00:03:46.101,"Excuse me, miss?"
00:03:46.101,00:03:47.769,I just want you to be careful...
00:03:47.769,00:03:50.564,where you put down that monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...
00:03:50.564,00:03:52.983,because the party's down to three Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.
00:03:52.983,00:03:54.985,It might attract some desperate characters.
00:03:54.985,00:03:57.529,It could.
00:04:02.242,00:04:04.619,They already relieved me of my artisanal meat platter.
00:04:04.619,00:04:07.164,"Finally, someone tells me how to pronounce that word."
00:04:07.164,00:04:08.289,Meat?
00:04:08.289,00:04:10.042,"Yes, meat."
00:04:10.042,00:04:12.419,Thank you.
00:04:12.419,00:04:14.629,Don't tell me.
00:04:14.629,00:04:16.673,"Let's see, who's your type?"
00:04:16.673,00:04:18.258,I don't see you sitting quietly...
00:04:18.258,00:04:21.344,while he bloviates on his postgrad thesis about Proust.
00:04:21.344,00:04:23.805,Uh-oh. Is that him?
00:04:23.805,00:04:26.349,"Ironic hipster, so self-aware, he makes everything a joke."
00:04:26.349,00:04:29.019,"I prefer men who are funny, not funny."
00:04:30.979,00:04:32.606,What type are you?
00:04:32.606,00:04:33.815,"Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy."
00:04:33.815,00:04:34.900,Missouri?
00:04:34.900,00:04:35.984,Cute.
00:04:35.984,00:04:37.194,Native New Yorker?
00:04:37.194,00:04:38.445,The world ends at the Hudson.
00:04:38.445,00:04:40.655,-What's your name?
00:04:40.655,00:04:42.824,"Well, Amy, who are you?"
00:04:44.201,00:04:47.454,"A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander."
00:04:47.454,00:04:51.708,"B, I'm a moderately influential warlord."
00:04:51.708,00:04:55.336,"C, I write personality quizzes for magazines."
00:04:55.336,00:04:59.674,Okay. Your hands are far too delicate for real scrimshaw work...
00:04:59.674,00:05:02.552,and I happen to be a charter subscriber to Middling Warlord Weekly...
00:05:02.552,00:05:04.263,so I'd recognize you.
00:05:04.263,00:05:05.472,I'm gonna go with C.
00:05:05.472,00:05:06.807,And you?
00:05:07.766,00:05:09.517,Who are you?
00:05:09.517,00:05:13.772,I'm the guy to save you from all this awesomeness.
00:05:18.026,00:05:20.904,"Oh, so, you write for a men's magazine."
00:05:20.904,00:05:23.115,"God, does that make you an expert on being a man?"
00:05:26.076,00:05:27.244,"It's what to wear, what to drink."
00:05:27.244,00:05:29.288,How to bullshit.
00:05:29.288,00:05:31.039,Never with you.
00:05:31.039,00:05:33.500,"No, I mean it."
00:05:33.500,00:05:36.086,It's hard to believe you.
00:05:36.086,00:05:37.629,I think it's your chin.
00:05:37.629,00:05:38.839,My chin?
00:05:38.839,00:05:41.508,it's quite villainous.
00:05:41.508,00:05:44.219,"Okay, how's this?"
00:05:44.219,00:05:47.472,"A hundred percent true, no bullshit."
00:05:47.472,00:05:49.183,Okay.
00:05:49.183,00:05:50.934,NICK: We all move to New York...
00:05:50.934,00:05:54.688,"and we end up living in these little cubby holes, and that's not it."
00:05:54.688,00:05:58.066,Come outside.
00:06:00.527,00:06:02.112,You have to see this.
00:06:10.745,00:06:11.830,Hey.
00:06:11.830,00:06:13.123,Hey.
00:06:21.840,00:06:23.591,I have to kiss you now.
00:06:23.591,00:06:25.969,Is that right?
00:06:25.969,00:06:28.222,I can't let you go through a sugar storm unkissed.
00:06:29.848,00:06:31.183,Oh. Wait a second.
00:06:33.977,00:06:35.354,There you go.
00:06:47.448,00:06:48.783,Nick Dunne...
00:06:50.409,00:06:52.620,I really like you.
00:06:59.002,00:07:00.962,"So, is Amy gonna do one of those anniversary..."
00:07:02.089,00:07:03.548,treasure hunts?
00:07:03.548,00:07:05.800,You mean the forced march designed to prove...
00:07:05.800,00:07:08.303,what an oblivious and uncaring asshole her husband is?
00:07:08.303,00:07:09.470,Wow.
00:07:12.432,00:07:14.101,Life.
00:07:14.101,00:07:16.186,Deep Hasbro thoughts.
00:07:16.186,00:07:18.605,Spin.
00:07:18.605,00:07:20.941,What was the clue last year she got so mad about?
00:07:20.941,00:07:24.111,When your poor Amy has a cold...
00:07:24.111,00:07:25.737,this dessert just must be sold.
00:07:25.737,00:07:26.821,The answer?
00:07:26.821,00:07:28.823,"I still don't know the answer, Go."
00:07:28.823,00:07:29.908,"GO: A few years ago, you'd have known."
00:07:29.908,00:07:31.743,"NICK: A few years ago, it was fun."
00:07:31.743,00:07:32.744,"Year one, the traditional gift was paper."
00:07:32.744,00:07:34.704,She got me a beautiful notebook.
00:07:34.704,00:07:36.039,Told me to go write my novel.
00:07:36.039,00:07:37.165,What did you get her?
00:07:37.165,00:07:38.541,A kite.
00:07:38.541,00:07:40.168,She'd never flown a kite.
00:07:41.295,00:07:44.089,NICK: Anyway.
00:07:44.089,00:07:47.217,She led me outside to the dying rosebush in the backyard.
00:07:47.217,00:07:48.260,"Ugh, that's symbolic."
00:07:48.260,00:07:49.428,Yeah.
00:07:49.428,00:07:50.971,What's the gift for five?
00:07:50.971,00:07:52.055,Wood.
00:07:52.055,00:07:53.307,"So, what did you get her?"
00:07:53.307,00:07:55.183,There's no good gift for wood.
00:07:55.183,00:07:57.894,"I know! Go home, fuck her brains out, slap her with your penis."
00:07:57.894,00:07:59.479,"There's some wood for you, bitch."
00:08:02.732,00:08:04.776,The Bar.
00:08:04.776,00:08:07.362,"Why, yes."
00:08:07.362,00:08:08.863,"Hey, it's Watchful Wally."
00:08:10.907,00:08:12.742,"Hey, Walt."
00:08:14.035,00:08:16.246,Oh.
00:08:16.246,00:08:18.081,Thanks very much.
00:08:30.551,00:08:32.929,"Hey, buddy."
00:08:34.139,00:08:35.849,"Thanks, Walt!"
00:08:51.323,00:08:52.615,Ame?
00:09:27.234,00:09:28.402,Hello?
00:09:28.402,00:09:29.819,Come on in.
00:09:30.237,00:09:31.696,Hey.
00:09:31.696,00:09:33.407,Mister Dunne.
00:09:33.407,00:09:35.700,I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
00:09:35.700,00:09:37.702,We understand there are concerns about your wife.
00:09:37.702,00:09:39.454,I don't know where my wife is.
00:09:39.454,00:09:41.456,And I came home to this.
00:09:42.665,00:09:45.544,"Now, I don't panic easily..."
00:09:45.544,00:09:47.754,"but it's weird, right?"
00:09:48.963,00:09:51.258,Mind if we look around?
00:09:51.258,00:09:52.592,BONEY: How long have you two been here?
00:09:52.592,00:09:55.220,Two years in September.
00:09:55.220,00:09:56.888,City?
00:09:56.888,00:09:59.807,"Yeah, I was a writer."
00:09:59.807,00:10:01.142,Why did you all move back here?
00:10:01.142,00:10:02.977,My mom got sick.
00:10:02.977,00:10:05.939,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:10:05.939,00:10:07.315,She's dead.
00:10:07.315,00:10:08.400,I'm so sorry.
00:10:14.239,00:10:17.451,"What do you do now, for work?"
00:10:17.451,00:10:19.578,My sister Margo and I own The Bar downtown.
00:10:19.578,00:10:21.413,"Oh, The Bar."
00:10:21.413,00:10:23.790,Love the name.
00:10:23.790,00:10:25.292,Thanks.
00:10:27.835,00:10:29.670,Pretty things.
00:10:35.718,00:10:37.512,"My office, here."
00:10:40.474,00:10:42.601,Beautiful dress.
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.689,Date night?
00:10:48.689,00:10:49.774,Hmm.
00:10:51.818,00:10:53.570,"NICK: It's a guest bedroom, there."
00:10:53.570,00:10:55.405,Cat's room on the end.
00:10:55.405,00:10:56.656,I checked up here.
00:11:01.328,00:11:02.579,This is the kitchen...
00:11:02.579,00:11:03.788,obviously.
00:11:19.638,00:11:21.473,This is my wife's office.
00:11:21.473,00:11:22.849,Amy's office.
00:11:35.987,00:11:39.157,BONEY: Wow.
00:11:39.157,00:11:40.450,Yeah.
00:11:40.450,00:11:41.742,I remember these.
00:11:42.743,00:11:43.870,I loved these books.
00:11:48.249,00:11:49.584,Wait a minute.
00:11:49.584,00:11:51.670,Your wife is Amazing Amy?
00:11:52.086,00:11:54.548,Yeah. She is.
00:11:54.548,00:11:56.174,Wow.
00:11:59.469,00:12:03.014,AMY: Amazing-fucking-Amy is getting fucking married.
00:12:03.014,00:12:05.058,That's how the night started.
00:12:05.058,00:12:11.147,"With me, regular, flawed, real Amy, jealous, as always, of the golden child."
00:12:11.147,00:12:15.818,"Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy, who's getting fucking married."
00:12:15.818,00:12:17.862,"When I was 10, I quit cello."
00:12:17.862,00:12:21.199,"In the next book, Amazing Amy became a prodigy."
00:12:23.660,00:12:24.994,Did you play volleyball?
00:12:24.994,00:12:26.621,"AMY: I got cut, freshman year."
00:12:26.621,00:12:29.040,She made varsity.
00:12:30.041,00:12:32.085,When did you have a dog?
00:12:32.085,00:12:33.878,She got the dog.
00:12:33.878,00:12:36.047,Puddles made her more relatable.
00:12:36.047,00:12:37.798,Wow.
00:12:37.798,00:12:39.758,I love your parents...
00:12:39.758,00:12:41.802,but they really can be assholes.
00:12:41.802,00:12:43.388,RAND: Nick!
00:12:43.388,00:12:45.724,"Hey, thanks for coming, man."
00:12:45.724,00:12:47.766,"Hey, sweetheart."
00:12:47.766,00:12:49.810,Big night for your mom.
00:12:49.810,00:12:53.106,It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters...
00:12:53.106,00:12:55.024,"bloggers, give them a little Amy color."
00:12:55.024,00:12:56.943,People wanna hear from you.
00:12:56.943,00:12:58.528,We can't stay long.
00:12:58.528,00:13:01.197,"Fifteen minutes, tops."
00:13:01.197,00:13:03.408,This is why I have my brownstone.
00:13:03.408,00:13:05.660,My trust fund.
00:13:05.660,00:13:08.204,Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood.
00:13:08.204,00:13:10.123,"No, they improved upon it..."
00:13:10.123,00:13:12.584,and then peddled it to the masses.
00:13:12.584,00:13:14.669,I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme.
00:13:14.669,00:13:16.254,I thought that would be creepy.
00:13:16.254,00:13:20.883,"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing-- Hold up!"
00:13:20.883,00:13:22.927,"You're very cute, Nick."
00:13:22.927,00:13:24.512,"Amy, you know what would make Dad's night."
00:13:24.512,00:13:26.180,"Oh, I'm on it."
00:13:27.390,00:13:30.477,I love having strangers pick at my scabs.
00:13:30.477,00:13:32.312,FEMALE REPORTER: I'm curious whether...
00:13:32.312,00:13:34.230,it's difficult for you to see Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.
00:13:34.230,00:13:37.066,And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding.
00:13:37.066,00:13:39.277,Because it's my understanding you are not married.
00:13:39.277,00:13:40.695,Is that correct?
00:13:41.780,00:13:43.114,Correct.
00:13:43.114,00:13:45.784,Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me.
00:13:45.784,00:13:49.496,"Excuse me. I'm sorry, I just have a few questions."
00:13:49.496,00:13:50.997,It's you.
00:13:50.997,00:13:53.792,I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity.
00:13:53.792,00:13:55.418,"Now, you had the distinct pleasure..."
00:13:55.418,00:13:57.044,of dating Nick Dunne for how long?
00:13:57.044,00:13:58.505,Two magical years.
00:13:58.505,00:14:00.298,Two magical years.
00:14:00.298,00:14:02.008,"In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity..."
00:14:02.008,00:14:04.636,to perform such gracious gestures as...
00:14:04.636,00:14:08.348,not correcting Nick when he pronounced quinoa as kween-o-a.
00:14:08.348,00:14:09.724,An understandable mistake.
00:14:09.724,00:14:10.975,He also thought it was a fish.
00:14:10.975,00:14:13.770,He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.
00:14:13.770,00:14:16.189,You also manage to appear shocked and delighted...
00:14:16.189,00:14:18.650,when Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition...
00:14:18.650,00:14:20.985,"of New York, New York, every time she sees you."
00:14:22.821,00:14:24.447,That's just frightening.
00:14:24.447,00:14:26.700,You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors.
00:14:26.700,00:14:28.576,And matching stapler.
00:14:28.576,00:14:31.538,"Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing."
00:14:31.538,00:14:34.957,"You are brilliant, yet entirely un-snobby."
00:14:34.957,00:14:38.795,You challenge me.
00:14:38.795,00:14:40.463,"And, fun fact for the readers..."
00:14:40.463,00:14:42.256,you have a world-class vagina.
00:14:45.134,00:14:47.721,My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married.
00:14:47.721,00:14:49.514,Is that correct?
00:14:49.514,00:14:51.098,I'm not.
00:14:51.098,00:14:52.350,Isn't it time we fixed that?
00:14:53.852,00:14:55.770,AMY: And then...
00:14:55.770,00:14:58.356,the night wasn't so bad anymore.
00:15:14.997,00:15:17.458,And it's done.
00:15:17.458,00:15:19.502,"Now, normally, we would not treat this..."
00:15:19.502,00:15:21.462,as a missing persons case so quick...
00:15:21.462,00:15:23.047,but given the scene at your house...
00:15:23.047,00:15:24.965,and given our spike in violent crime of late...
00:15:24.965,00:15:27.301,"we are gonna take this very, very seriously."
00:15:27.301,00:15:29.053,Okay. Good.
00:15:29.053,00:15:30.597,We've got forensics over at your place.
00:15:30.597,00:15:32.014,You got somewhere to stay?
00:15:32.014,00:15:33.558,I could stay at my sister's.
00:15:33.558,00:15:35.976,"We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards."
00:15:35.976,00:15:37.645,"We will organize searches, put up flyers."
00:15:37.645,00:15:39.188,We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.
00:15:39.188,00:15:40.690,You're having a press conference?
00:15:40.690,00:15:42.191,"I wanna get the word out, right?"
00:15:42.191,00:15:44.193,"Yeah, it's just all of a sudden..."
00:15:44.193,00:15:46.362,I feel like I'm on a Law &amp; Order episode.
00:15:54.621,00:15:56.873,Time is of the essence in these cases.
00:15:56.873,00:15:59.626,"But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?"
00:15:59.626,00:16:01.001,Absolutely not.
00:16:01.001,00:16:02.629,"So, you and Amy have been here two years."
00:16:02.629,00:16:06.048,You tend bar-- I own The Bar.
00:16:06.048,00:16:09.510,And I teach creative writing at MVCC.
00:16:09.510,00:16:11.262,No kids?
00:16:11.262,00:16:13.013,"So, what does Amy do most days?"
00:16:13.013,00:16:15.558,"A woman with all those degrees, what does she do?"
00:16:15.558,00:16:16.893,I don't know.
00:16:16.893,00:16:18.352,Doing what?
00:16:20.521,00:16:22.356,She's a voracious reader.
00:16:22.356,00:16:24.984,"So, she's always got a book in her hand."
00:16:26.193,00:16:28.195,"Well, days can get long."
00:16:28.195,00:16:31.449,"I know a few housewives, that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon."
00:16:31.449,00:16:32.826,Or prescription pills.
00:16:32.826,00:16:34.953,"GILPIN: Just last week, we had a soccer mom."
00:16:34.953,00:16:37.163,Nice lady.
00:16:37.163,00:16:39.039,"Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work."
00:16:39.039,00:16:40.750,We cannot keep up with the drug violence.
00:16:40.750,00:16:43.043,I'm pretty sure that's not it.
00:16:43.043,00:16:44.629,Has Amy got friends we can talk to?
00:16:44.629,00:16:45.922,Um...
00:16:46.881,00:16:48.299,"No, not really."
00:16:48.299,00:16:50.551,No friends?
00:16:50.551,00:16:54.138,"She was very close with my mom, before she passed away."
00:16:54.138,00:16:56.056,"You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem..."
00:16:56.056,00:16:57.642,in our neighborhood.
00:16:57.642,00:16:58.977,I think maybe you guys should check that out.
00:17:00.394,00:17:01.855,We'll look into that.
00:17:01.855,00:17:04.440,You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.
00:17:04.440,00:17:05.859,Where were you before that?
00:17:05.859,00:17:07.652,"Well, I was home."
00:17:07.652,00:17:09.737,"I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper."
00:17:09.737,00:17:11.364,I went to Sawyer Beach and read the news.
00:17:11.364,00:17:13.616,Did you visit with anyone there?
00:17:13.616,00:17:15.409,I kind of go to Sawyer Beach for the solitude.
00:17:16.786,00:17:19.288,"So, your wife has no friends here."
00:17:19.288,00:17:21.123,Is she kinda standoffish?
00:17:21.123,00:17:23.710,Ivy League?
00:17:23.710,00:17:26.295,She's from New York.
00:17:26.295,00:17:29.340,She's complicated.
00:17:29.340,00:17:31.258,Type A?
00:17:31.258,00:17:33.511,That can make you crazy if you're not like that.
00:17:33.511,00:17:34.929,You seem pretty laid-back.
00:17:34.929,00:17:36.389,Type B.
00:17:36.389,00:17:39.266,"Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?"
00:17:39.266,00:17:41.060,"God, I don't know."
00:17:41.060,00:17:42.311,You don't know if she has friends...
00:17:42.311,00:17:43.855,you don't know what she does all day...
00:17:43.855,00:17:45.565,and you don't know your wife's blood type.
00:17:45.565,00:17:46.774,Sure you all are married?
00:17:48.067,00:17:49.736,Uh... Maybe it's type O.
00:17:49.736,00:17:51.905,Where are her folks?
00:17:51.905,00:17:53.614,Can they get here time for this press conference tomorrow?
00:17:53.614,00:17:55.700,Tomorrow? I have no idea.
00:17:55.700,00:17:57.535,You haven't called your wife's parents yet?
00:17:57.535,00:17:58.828,You can't get a signal in this building.
00:17:58.828,00:17:59.871,I've been in here talking to you.
00:17:59.871,00:18:02.331,"Call them, please, Nick. Now."
00:18:02.331,00:18:03.708,Fine.
00:18:09.255,00:18:11.215,Should I know my wife's blood type?
00:18:13.342,00:18:16.429,"I apologize, Marybeth."
00:18:16.429,00:18:17.889,Now I'm at the station...
00:18:17.889,00:18:22.393,"and the cops are at the house, and it's serious and I'm calling you."
00:18:22.393,00:18:25.104,There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now.
00:18:25.104,00:18:28.482,I'm standing right next to Detective Rhonda Boney...
00:18:28.482,00:18:30.526,who's the lead investigator on this and she's...
00:18:32.737,00:18:34.781,My mother-in-law would like to speak with you.
00:18:36.198,00:18:37.324,This is Detective Boney.
00:18:37.324,00:18:38.826,BILL: I wanna go home.
00:18:38.826,00:18:41.454,I don't know why I have to be here.
00:18:41.454,00:18:44.040,I don't wanna be here.
00:18:44.040,00:18:45.708,Dad?
00:18:45.708,00:18:47.251,This is my father.
00:18:47.251,00:18:49.336,Really?
00:18:49.336,00:18:50.671,We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon.
00:18:50.671,00:18:52.298,I've been right there.
00:18:52.298,00:18:54.383,Bitch.
00:18:54.383,00:18:56.052,Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill after lunch.
00:18:56.052,00:18:58.554,"We found him walking Route 79, disoriented."
00:18:58.554,00:19:01.140,We've been trying to call you for the last-- I don't get a cell signal in this building.
00:19:01.140,00:19:03.476,I've been sitting 20 feet away from you.
00:19:03.476,00:19:05.061,"Sir, please don't take that tone with me."
00:19:05.061,00:19:06.270,"Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch."
00:19:06.270,00:19:07.814,"Dad, stop."
00:19:10.566,00:19:12.401,You wanna drive him home?
00:19:12.401,00:19:14.862,I think that would be wise.
00:19:34.423,00:19:37.135,AUTOMATED VOICE: This voice mailbox is currently full.
00:19:37.927,00:19:39.219,Fuck.
00:19:41.347,00:19:43.850,"Oh, get your fucking hands off me."
00:19:43.850,00:19:45.184,NICK: Thanks.
00:19:58.364,00:20:02.326,AMY: Everyone told us and told us and told us...
00:20:02.326,00:20:04.829,marriage is hard work.
00:20:04.829,00:20:08.207,And compromise and more work.
00:20:08.207,00:20:10.334,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter."
00:20:10.334,00:20:13.253,When young Amy's hope did wane...
00:20:13.253,00:20:15.048,she wandered here...
00:20:15.048,00:20:17.175,"AMY: Well, it's not true."
00:20:17.175,00:20:19.760,...in search of Jane.
00:20:19.760,00:20:22.972,"AMY: With us, two years..."
00:20:22.972,00:20:24.891,it's just good.
00:20:24.891,00:20:28.519,Austen. Hmm.
00:20:28.519,00:20:32.106,You were an alienated teen and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.
00:20:32.648,00:20:34.775,Look at that.
00:20:36.736,00:20:38.571,My God.
00:20:38.571,00:20:40.280,You naughty minx.
00:20:40.280,00:20:42.867,"Well, technically, we are supposed to fuck at the next stop."
00:20:42.867,00:20:44.702,"Yeah, in keeping with tradition."
00:20:44.702,00:20:48.122,But I might be willing to bend the rules this once.
00:20:48.122,00:20:49.582,God bless Jane Austen.
00:21:05.264,00:21:06.849,I'm enthusiastic.
00:21:06.849,00:21:09.102,Look at that.
00:21:12.230,00:21:14.398,"Oh, thank you."
00:21:15.399,00:21:16.817,Year two. Cotton.
00:21:23.908,00:21:28.246,We had that joke that our sex was too good for ordinary.
00:21:28.246,00:21:37.255,"So, these are 2,000 thread-count-- We're so cute."
00:21:37.255,00:21:38.631,I wanna punch us in the face.
00:21:38.631,00:21:41.675,That's pretty great.
00:21:43.177,00:21:44.762,GO: Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?
00:21:44.762,00:21:47.389,I don't need a lawyer.
00:21:47.389,00:21:49.391,"Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy?"
00:21:49.391,00:21:51.018,"You know, they asked..."
00:21:51.018,00:21:53.229,why didn't she have any friends?
00:21:53.229,00:21:56.482,I said she was complicated.
00:21:56.482,00:21:58.818,Everyone knows complicated is code for bitch.
00:22:03.739,00:22:06.159,I feel sick.
00:22:06.159,00:22:07.534,Thanks.
00:22:08.410,00:22:10.370,It's so bizarre.
00:22:10.370,00:22:12.498,It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy.
00:22:12.498,00:22:16.002,She always attracts-- Drama?
00:22:16.002,00:22:17.670,You can say it.
00:22:17.670,00:22:20.047,Just because I don't like to be around Amy...
00:22:20.047,00:22:21.174,doesn't mean I don't care about her.
00:22:24.468,00:22:26.470,"Anyway, whoever took her is bound to bring her back."
00:22:35.813,00:22:37.940,NOELLE: Detective?
00:22:37.940,00:22:40.567,I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
00:22:41.861,00:22:44.905,"Well, great."
00:22:44.905,00:22:46.573,Five doors down. 1032.
00:22:46.573,00:22:48.868,Wonderful.
00:22:48.868,00:22:50.786,Can I come by in half an hour?
00:22:50.786,00:22:52.454,Y'all know anything yet?
00:22:52.454,00:22:53.789,I got guys on the clock in here.
00:22:53.789,00:22:55.249,But you give me 30 minutes.
00:22:55.249,00:22:57.335,But that's usually bath time.
00:22:57.335,00:22:59.920,"Well, we'll talk in between shampoos."
00:23:02.840,00:23:04.300,All right.
00:23:04.300,00:23:07.178,It was definitely blood spatter you saw in the kitchen.
00:23:07.178,00:23:09.055,"Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep."
00:23:09.055,00:23:11.349,"Not that weird, but that is awfully high."
00:23:11.349,00:23:12.892,"So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep."
00:23:12.892,00:23:14.185,"Well, okay."
00:23:16.354,00:23:17.938,"Mmm, interesting."
00:23:17.938,00:23:19.148,What's that?
00:23:19.148,00:23:21.234,House is rented in her name.
00:23:21.234,00:23:22.902,Car's in her name.
00:23:22.902,00:23:25.779,"Credit cards, utilities, phone bill, all in her name."
00:23:25.779,00:23:27.865,Even his bar's in her name.
00:23:27.865,00:23:29.575,I don't know that that's so surprising.
00:23:29.575,00:23:31.285,No. But it is humiliating.
00:23:31.285,00:23:32.578,What you got?
00:23:32.578,00:23:34.997,It's with her unmentionables.
00:23:47.551,00:23:50.221,"Well, we have our first clue."
00:24:01.315,00:24:03.192,I have to take a shower.
00:24:03.192,00:24:05.236,"No, don't."
00:24:05.236,00:24:07.029,You wanna look like you've been up all night.
00:24:08.739,00:24:11.242,"Hey, be careful today, okay?"
00:24:11.242,00:24:12.701,That's a weird thing to say.
00:24:12.701,00:24:14.412,"Well, when you're upset, you bottle up."
00:24:14.412,00:24:18.082,"You can seem angry, like-- Please don't say, Like Dad."
00:24:18.082,00:24:19.625,Or else you swing into your momma's-boy charm offensive...
00:24:19.625,00:24:21.919,and that can feel glib.
00:24:21.919,00:24:24.338,I'll balance on the exact fucking edge of your emotional razor.
00:24:24.338,00:24:25.923,Okay. Just be...
00:24:25.923,00:24:28.384,Myself?
00:24:28.384,00:24:30.636,...sponsoring a raffle to benefit West County 4H...
00:24:30.636,00:24:34.223,and raffling season tickets for Mizzou football.
00:24:34.223,00:24:37.184,Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut or local Tri-State Tire stores.
00:24:41.855,00:24:43.107,Your in-laws made it.
00:24:45.067,00:24:46.152,"Hi, Rand."
00:24:46.152,00:24:47.236,I'm Detective Boney.
00:24:47.236,00:24:49.196,I'm the twin. Margo.
00:24:49.196,00:24:50.781,"We played tennis yesterday, Nick."
00:24:50.781,00:24:52.366,I just can't get over it.
00:24:52.366,00:24:54.034,"Marybeth, I am really sorry."
00:24:54.034,00:24:55.619,I knew you never should have moved back here.
00:24:55.619,00:24:57.079,We didn't have a lot of choice.
00:24:57.079,00:25:00.458,We are all worried.
00:25:00.458,00:25:02.209,But we are all here now.
00:25:02.209,00:25:04.670,"And we will find Amy, together."
00:25:15.389,00:25:17.141,"Should I just go first, and then you guys can say something?"
00:25:17.141,00:25:18.309,Good.
00:25:19.852,00:25:24.315,"As you know, my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne..."
00:25:24.315,00:25:27.776,disappeared from our home on the morning of July 5th...
00:25:27.776,00:25:30.488,under suspicious circumstances.
00:25:30.488,00:25:32.156,MALE REPORTER: Louder!
00:25:32.156,00:25:36.452,"If anyone out there, uh, has any information..."
00:25:36.452,00:25:38.954,please come forward.
00:25:38.954,00:25:40.289,Thank you.
00:25:42.833,00:25:45.711,I'm Rand Elliott.
00:25:45.711,00:25:47.254,Should I have said my name?
00:25:47.254,00:25:49.298,RAND: Amy is our only child.
00:25:49.298,00:25:53.677,"She's bright, she's beautiful."
00:25:53.677,00:25:55.721,She really is Amazing Amy.
00:25:55.721,00:25:58.391,"You know, there are millions of people out there..."
00:25:58.391,00:26:00.976,who grew up with her and care about her.
00:26:00.976,00:26:04.355,"We care about her, we love her."
00:26:04.355,00:26:06.690,And we just want her back.
00:26:08.734,00:26:11.611,Amy is a decorated scholar.
00:26:11.611,00:26:14.614,She forged a successful career in journalism.
00:26:14.614,00:26:17.034,She returned here to her husband's hometown...
00:26:17.034,00:26:18.994,and she made a life in her adopted home.
00:26:20.287,00:26:23.082,"Now, Amy needs your help."
00:26:23.082,00:26:26.960,We're establishing a volunteer headquarters at the Drury Lodge.
00:26:26.960,00:26:32.466,"We have a hotline, 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS."
00:26:32.466,00:26:38.389,And our website is www.FindAmazingAmy.com.
00:26:38.389,00:26:40.391,FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Dunne!
00:26:41.767,00:26:43.601,"FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?"
00:26:45.271,00:26:48.690,"Mr. Elliott, when was the last time you spoke to your daughter?"
00:26:50.484,00:26:51.777,MALE REPORTER: Smile.
00:26:57.950,00:26:59.535,That's all for now.
00:27:02.496,00:27:05.124,RAND: Amy is the kind of girl who attracts admirers.
00:27:05.124,00:27:07.251,"Right, Nick?"
00:27:07.251,00:27:09.669,And we've had instances...
00:27:09.669,00:27:12.005,where things got-- Scary.
00:27:12.005,00:27:13.382,Do you know about Desi Collings?
00:27:13.382,00:27:15.008,"Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings."
00:27:15.008,00:27:16.634,MARYBETH: He was obsessed.
00:27:16.634,00:27:19.846,He attempted suicide after Amy broke up with him sophomore year.
00:27:19.846,00:27:21.348,We had to file a restraining order.
00:27:21.348,00:27:23.850,This would be high school?
00:27:23.850,00:27:25.436,But he recently moved to St. Louis.
00:27:25.436,00:27:27.187,That's just two hours away.
00:27:27.187,00:27:28.814,"To be fair, he is from St. Louis."
00:27:28.814,00:27:30.648,RAND: We also have Tommy O'Hara.
00:27:30.648,00:27:32.985,"This is only eight years ago, in New York."
00:27:32.985,00:27:35.154,"She broke up with him, he got very physical."
00:27:35.154,00:27:37.030,She filed charges.
00:27:37.030,00:27:38.949,"Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?"
00:27:38.949,00:27:40.951,I only know it was bad.
00:27:40.951,00:27:42.744,I didn't know this.
00:27:42.744,00:27:44.330,Thank you.
00:27:44.330,00:27:45.872,"Uh, anything more recent?"
00:27:49.460,00:27:51.295,Not that I know of.
00:27:53.755,00:27:56.758,"Hey, Nick?"
00:27:57.884,00:27:59.470,Yeah.
00:28:04.975,00:28:06.477,Imagine our confusion.
00:28:06.477,00:28:07.727,A missing persons case...
00:28:07.727,00:28:08.854,and in your wife's dressing room...
00:28:08.854,00:28:10.272,we find an envelope marked clue.
00:28:10.272,00:28:12.650,That's for our anniversary.
00:28:12.650,00:28:15.068,My wife does these treasure hunts.
00:28:15.068,00:28:17.321,I'm hoping you can tell me what this means.
00:28:17.321,00:28:18.864,You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?
00:28:18.864,00:28:21.283,It'll help me track Amy's movements before she disappeared.
00:28:21.283,00:28:23.536,Of course. Okay.
00:28:23.536,00:28:26.955,Although this spot couldn't be tighter...
00:28:26.955,00:28:29.458,it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
00:28:32.419,00:28:34.254,I know this one!
00:28:34.254,00:28:38.175,AMY: Although this spot couldn't be any tighter...
00:28:38.175,00:28:40.719,it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.
00:28:42.513,00:28:46.099,"After-school meeting, don't mind if I do."
00:28:46.099,00:28:48.602,Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.
00:28:52.814,00:28:55.275,"Well, well."
00:28:55.275,00:28:58.070,Clue two.
00:28:58.070,00:29:01.740,"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover."
00:29:01.740,00:29:05.785,"You'll be the spy, and I'll be his lover."
00:29:05.785,00:29:07.329,Let's head on over...
00:29:07.329,00:29:09.456,to the little brown house.
00:29:09.456,00:29:12.710,"We'll play hot, doting husband, sweet, loving spouse."
00:29:15.546,00:29:16.672,These yours?
00:29:17.256,00:29:18.465,No.
00:29:18.465,00:29:20.092,But you read the first clue.
00:29:20.092,00:29:23.178,"Randy professor, naughty student."
00:29:23.178,00:29:24.388,I blush.
00:29:24.388,00:29:25.931,Me and my ex just swapped cards.
00:29:27.349,00:29:28.642,Where's this little brown house?
00:29:28.642,00:29:30.102,I have no idea.
00:30:13.228,00:30:15.522,Hello?
00:30:15.522,00:30:18.191,Nicholas Dunne.
00:30:18.191,00:30:20.902,"Under my father's name, William Dunne."
00:30:27.576,00:30:29.453,My wife's first pet?
00:30:29.453,00:30:32.498,"Can you just turn the bell-- Yeah, I know."
00:30:32.498,00:30:34.541,"It's, uh... It's, uh..."
00:30:35.208,00:30:36.835,Uh...
00:30:36.835,00:30:38.796,"It's Puddles, right?"
00:30:42.841,00:30:44.426,We're good.
00:30:46.094,00:30:47.304,"Hello, stranger."
00:30:47.304,00:30:49.515,Fancy meeting you here.
00:30:49.515,00:30:51.933,"It's your dad's house, right?"
00:30:51.933,00:30:54.394,Are you following me?
00:30:54.394,00:30:56.689,"Like you said, it's my dad's house."
00:30:56.689,00:30:59.149,"I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down."
00:31:01.151,00:31:02.319,But it looks okay.
00:31:03.195,00:31:04.863,I'll walk you out.
00:31:08.116,00:31:10.035,You know...
00:31:10.035,00:31:13.163,I thought maybe this was the little brown house.
00:31:13.163,00:31:14.456,From the clue.
00:31:14.456,00:31:16.249,Nope. Still blue.
00:31:32.974,00:31:37.270,"AMY: Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad."
00:31:37.270,00:31:41.525,"I need to be punished, and by punished, I mean had."
00:31:41.525,00:31:44.820,It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.
00:31:44.820,00:31:48.323,"So open the door, and look alive."
00:31:49.616,00:31:50.743,Bitch!
00:31:54.830,00:31:58.166,AMY: Want to test your marriage for weak spots?
00:31:58.166,00:31:59.877,Add one recession...
00:31:59.877,00:32:01.837,subtract two jobs.
00:32:01.837,00:32:04.047,It's surprisingly effective.
00:32:04.047,00:32:06.341,Promise me we'll never be like them.
00:32:06.341,00:32:07.885,Like who?
00:32:07.885,00:32:09.845,All those awful couples we know.
00:32:09.845,00:32:13.515,Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys...
00:32:13.515,00:32:15.642,to be trained and paraded.
00:32:15.642,00:32:18.729,Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol...
00:32:18.729,00:32:21.064,to be out-foxed and avoided.
00:32:26.152,00:32:28.739,I think I'm gonna be laid off.
00:32:28.739,00:32:31.283,We're in a recession.
00:32:31.283,00:32:33.326,I'll probably be next.
00:32:33.326,00:32:35.120,We have each other.
00:32:35.120,00:32:37.623,Everything else is background noise.
00:32:38.665,00:32:40.500,You are exceptional.
00:32:48.300,00:32:49.426,My turn.
00:32:51.428,00:32:53.096,My parents' publisher dropped them...
00:32:53.096,00:32:54.556,and they're in debt up to their ears.
00:32:54.556,00:32:55.891,That's terrible.
00:32:55.891,00:32:57.976,And they need to borrow from my trust fund.
00:32:57.976,00:32:59.645,How much?
00:32:59.645,00:33:02.481,Almost a million.
00:33:02.481,00:33:04.483,That's almost all of it.
00:33:04.483,00:33:06.526,"This is where you say, Everything else is background noise."
00:33:06.526,00:33:07.694,"Amy, if you're laid off..."
00:33:07.694,00:33:09.028,and I'm laid off...
00:33:09.028,00:33:10.238,I said I'd do it.
00:33:10.238,00:33:11.615,Without talking to me?
00:33:11.615,00:33:13.158,"Well, it's..."
00:33:13.158,00:33:14.868,"...their money, technically."
00:33:19.164,00:33:21.541,You know what?
00:33:21.541,00:33:23.376,Everything else is just background noise.
00:33:32.218,00:33:33.303,Hey.
00:33:37.349,00:33:38.851,More games?
00:33:38.851,00:33:40.477,"Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks."
00:33:41.603,00:33:42.813,What's the laptop for?
00:33:44.105,00:33:45.398,Laptop-ing.
00:33:47.066,00:33:49.277,"Oh, I see."
00:33:49.277,00:33:51.780,"You can give your parents $879,000 without talking to me..."
00:33:51.780,00:33:53.365,but God forbid I buy a video game...
00:33:53.365,00:33:54.366,without getting your permission.
00:33:54.366,00:33:55.951,You are spending a lot.
00:33:55.951,00:33:58.077,You don't trust me.
00:33:58.077,00:33:59.496,You certainly don't trust my intention.
00:33:59.496,00:34:00.747,What are you talking about?
00:34:00.747,00:34:02.248,"That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it?"
00:34:02.248,00:34:04.626,Why are you throwing that in my face again?
00:34:04.626,00:34:06.879,Because it's easy to throw.
00:34:06.879,00:34:08.964,I don't get why you're daring me...
00:34:08.964,00:34:10.340,to be someone I don't wanna be.
00:34:10.340,00:34:13.051,The nagging shrew.
00:34:13.051,00:34:15.804,I'm not that person.
00:34:15.804,00:34:17.764,I'm sorry.
00:34:17.764,00:34:19.474,I just don't know how to do this.
00:34:19.474,00:34:21.267,"I flipped burgers, I painted houses."
00:34:21.267,00:34:23.520,You'll get another job.
00:34:27.816,00:34:28.901,"Hi, Go."
00:34:31.028,00:34:32.738,What? Hold on. What?
00:34:32.738,00:34:34.573,AMY: And suddenly...
00:34:34.573,00:34:36.115,AMY: ...I knew everything was about to get worse.
00:34:36.115,00:34:38.076,"Okay, tell me what's wrong."
00:35:05.103,00:35:06.563,"Bless you, Nick."
00:35:07.313,00:35:08.648,"Hey, Tom. Mayor!"
00:35:08.648,00:35:09.858,"Nick, good to see you."
00:35:09.858,00:35:11.068,NICK: Good to see you.
00:35:11.068,00:35:12.193,"Hey, guys, hey."
00:35:14.654,00:35:16.114,Jodie.
00:35:17.908,00:35:20.619,"Oh, we'll find her."
00:35:34.633,00:35:36.093,You look like hammered shit.
00:35:36.093,00:35:37.761,"Oh, thank you."
00:35:45.978,00:35:48.480,You ever see that guy in the glasses before?
00:35:48.480,00:35:51.190,Don't worry. We videotape everybody that comes in and out of these things.
00:35:51.190,00:35:52.859,"I mean, you tend to get a lot of..."
00:35:52.859,00:35:54.111,Do-gooders?
00:35:54.111,00:35:55.403,Freaks.
00:35:55.403,00:35:57.405,"Hey, I meant to ask you."
00:35:57.405,00:35:59.825,Noelle Hawthorne?
00:35:59.825,00:36:02.702,She lives on your street.
00:36:02.702,00:36:03.954,I've never heard the name Noelle Hawthorne.
00:36:03.954,00:36:05.956,She and her husband have triplets.
00:36:05.956,00:36:07.791,Oh.
00:36:07.791,00:36:10.585,"Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street."
00:36:10.585,00:36:13.130,But best friend? No.
00:36:13.130,00:36:14.547,"Excuse me, one sec."
00:36:19.094,00:36:21.013,He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.
00:36:21.013,00:36:22.597,Of course he did.
00:36:22.597,00:36:23.765,"Look, these two are yours."
00:36:23.765,00:36:26.225,"Oh, look."
00:36:26.225,00:36:28.186,so everybody can see him being a good guy.
00:36:28.186,00:36:29.980,"Oh, you really don't like him, do you?"
00:36:29.980,00:36:31.439,What's to like?
00:36:53.211,00:36:55.505,AUTOMATED VOICE: This mailbox is currently full.
00:36:55.505,00:37:00.593,Press one to-- Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
00:37:00.593,00:37:03.346,I am so sorry for your troubles.
00:37:03.346,00:37:05.640,Thank you. That's kind.
00:37:05.640,00:37:07.266,"Well, a lot of cold cuts."
00:37:07.266,00:37:11.063,I'm gonna fix you up my world-famous chicken Frito pie.
00:37:11.063,00:37:12.731,That's very kind and very unnecessary.
00:37:12.731,00:37:14.607,You have to keep your strength.
00:37:14.607,00:37:16.776,Would you...
00:37:16.776,00:37:18.486,"say, Chicken Frito pie!"
00:37:21.364,00:37:22.657,Um...
00:37:22.657,00:37:25.326,You know what?
00:37:25.326,00:37:26.870,Would you delete that picture for me?
00:37:26.870,00:37:28.496,It's a nice photo.
00:37:28.496,00:37:30.082,But just do me a favor.
00:37:30.082,00:37:32.084,Will you?
00:37:32.084,00:37:34.753,Would you go ahead and please delete that picture?
00:37:34.753,00:37:35.837,You just press...
00:37:35.837,00:37:37.505,What is wrong with you?
00:37:37.505,00:37:38.924,Could you please not share that with anyone?
00:37:38.924,00:37:42.177,I will share it with whomever I please.
00:37:45.847,00:37:47.348,GO: Dude.
00:37:47.348,00:37:48.600,Marybeth is pissed.
00:37:49.059,00:37:51.019,Why?
00:37:52.979,00:37:54.898,Marybeth?
00:37:54.898,00:37:57.859,It's like you're the goddamn Homecoming King.
00:38:00.528,00:38:02.989,It was important to my mother that I be polite...
00:38:02.989,00:38:05.200,"I be considerate, I be a gentleman."
00:38:05.200,00:38:06.910,It looked like you were having fun.
00:38:06.910,00:38:09.829,I am in a nightmare!
00:38:09.829,00:38:12.415,All I'm trying to do is be nice...
00:38:12.415,00:38:15.627,to the people who are volunteering to help find Amy.
00:38:17.754,00:38:19.547,You're right.
00:38:20.298,00:38:22.341,And I'm sorry.
00:38:24.510,00:38:27.847,"My God, this place literally smells like feces."
00:38:39.192,00:38:42.154,"In your searches, did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?"
00:38:42.154,00:38:43.780,No.
00:38:44.864,00:38:46.532,How about a brand new Stratocaster?
00:38:46.532,00:38:47.784,"No, nothing like that."
00:38:48.326,00:38:50.536,"Well, all right."
00:38:55.708,00:38:58.544,How big's that TV?
00:38:58.544,00:38:59.963,"No, it's nowhere near that."
00:38:59.963,00:39:01.714,Okay.
00:39:01.714,00:39:03.049,Kibble?
00:39:03.049,00:39:05.468,He asked me to feed his cat.
00:39:05.468,00:39:07.428,"Oh, I saw some in the pantry."
00:39:07.428,00:39:11.641,"NOELLE: Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?"
00:39:11.641,00:39:13.434,I know y'all are in there!
00:39:13.434,00:39:15.478,Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne...
00:39:15.478,00:39:17.605,and her children back out to the street?
00:39:18.356,00:39:20.733,Detective Boney!
00:39:20.733,00:39:24.362,Just remind her it is a possible crime scene.
00:39:33.205,00:39:35.874,Look at that pie-eating grin...
00:39:35.874,00:39:37.834,from a guy whose wife is missing.
00:39:43.756,00:39:45.300,How are you doing?
00:39:47.177,00:39:48.594,How's Marybeth?
00:39:48.594,00:39:50.429,She's a wreck.
00:39:50.429,00:39:51.848,And you?
00:39:52.557,00:39:54.017,Awesome.
00:39:54.017,00:39:55.518,Hey...
00:39:55.518,00:39:57.187,have you told me everything?
00:39:57.187,00:39:59.147,Of course.
00:39:59.147,00:40:01.482,Why would you even ask me that?
00:40:01.482,00:40:04.443,"Ever since you walked into The Bar that morning Amy went missing, you seem..."
00:40:05.695,00:40:08.031,off.
00:40:08.031,00:40:11.243,Everybody's examining me and projecting their shit on me.
00:40:11.243,00:40:14.579,"All I want is to come over here, have a beer with you..."
00:40:14.579,00:40:16.039,and not be judged.
00:40:16.039,00:40:17.498,Can we do that?
00:40:18.499,00:40:19.751,Of course.
00:40:21.419,00:40:23.462,You know what I keep thinking?
00:40:23.462,00:40:29.427,-If Mom were here?
00:40:29.427,00:40:32.013,"Nick, Mom would fix it."
00:40:39.437,00:40:42.523,I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.
00:40:45.526,00:40:47.820,Love you.
00:40:52.409,00:40:54.244,"AMY: So, here's a strange, new sentence."
00:40:54.244,00:40:57.663,I am a Missourian.
00:41:04.087,00:41:05.713,"Mmm, bye, Dad."
00:41:08.007,00:41:11.386,"AMY: No money, no jobs, no prospects."
00:41:11.386,00:41:13.430,"And then, we heard from Go."
00:41:13.430,00:41:15.598,Mama Maureen...
00:41:15.598,00:41:18.226,Stage 4 breast cancer.
00:41:20.603,00:41:23.231,"So, we moved to Missouri."
00:41:23.231,00:41:25.024,I don't mind.
00:41:25.024,00:41:28.069,I just wish he'd asked.
00:41:39.789,00:41:42.459,Nick is happy to be home.
00:41:42.459,00:41:44.669,But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him.
00:41:46.463,00:41:49.799,I feel like something he loaded by mistake.
00:41:49.799,00:41:52.844,"Something to be jettisoned, if necessary."
00:41:52.844,00:41:55.221,Something disposable.
00:41:57.140,00:41:59.476,I feel like I could disappear.
00:42:43.436,00:42:45.730,"Oh, my God!"
00:42:45.730,00:42:47.773,I saw you on TV.
00:42:47.773,00:42:49.401,It's so crazy.
00:42:49.401,00:42:51.652,She just vanished?
00:42:51.652,00:42:53.488,I've been so worried about you.
00:42:53.488,00:42:55.365,I called you a hundred times.
00:42:55.365,00:42:57.325,Rehearsals.
00:42:57.325,00:42:58.784,Godspell.
00:43:00.703,00:43:02.330,My sister's asleep in the other room.
00:43:02.330,00:43:03.540,I needed to see you.
00:43:03.540,00:43:05.166,I know this is a bad idea.
00:43:05.166,00:43:06.876,Can you at least tell me you love me?
00:43:06.876,00:43:10.629,"I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now."
00:43:10.629,00:43:11.714,"Oh, I've been so scared."
00:43:11.714,00:43:13.299,Between rehearsals?
00:43:13.299,00:43:14.800,You told me I needed to have my own life.
00:43:14.800,00:43:16.219,I know.
00:43:16.219,00:43:17.595,We need to stop.
00:43:17.595,00:43:19.097,I need you.
00:43:19.931,00:43:21.974,Touch me.
00:43:25.270,00:43:27.855,Stop it. Come here.
00:43:29.274,00:43:30.942,Sit down.
00:43:30.942,00:43:32.444,Okay.
00:43:32.444,00:43:36.531,"Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us?"
00:43:36.531,00:43:37.990,"Even in texting, or on Facebook."
00:43:37.990,00:43:41.035,Facebook? I use the disposable phone.
00:43:41.035,00:43:42.954,You buy my presents in cash.
00:43:42.954,00:43:45.873,"I know, sweetie."
00:43:45.873,00:43:49.127,I don't know. Maybe.
00:43:49.127,00:43:50.795,"Sweetheart, think."
00:43:50.795,00:43:52.797,I don't know.
00:43:52.797,00:43:55.633,"Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay?"
00:43:55.633,00:43:57.218,"This is the last time we're gonna see each other, until..."
00:43:57.218,00:43:59.220,Until when?
00:43:59.220,00:44:00.846,Until it's safe.
00:44:00.846,00:44:02.432,You were going to get a divorce.
00:44:02.432,00:44:04.476,Never say that out loud again.
00:44:04.476,00:44:07.103,Okay. I'm sorry.
00:44:08.020,00:44:09.314,I don't wanna fight.
00:44:11.149,00:44:12.691,I just wanna be with you.
00:44:12.691,00:44:14.193,"Andie, oh, please..."
00:44:14.652,00:44:16.362,That's all I want.
00:44:17.614,00:44:18.823,I can't.
00:44:21.159,00:44:23.536,It's our last time together.
00:44:23.536,00:44:25.413,Let's make the most of it.
00:44:32.295,00:44:35.507,"NICK: Real quick, but then you have to go."
00:44:38.510,00:44:41.262,AMY: My husband has come undone.
00:44:41.262,00:44:44.265,We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...
00:44:44.265,00:44:47.560,"but as it turns out, we couldn't."
00:44:50.271,00:44:53.191,It means a lot that you came.
00:44:53.191,00:44:55.443,AMY: We took a hit on the brownstone...
00:44:55.443,00:44:57.820,and I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar.
00:44:57.820,00:44:59.780,"So far, it's just costing money."
00:45:04.452,00:45:07.788,Nick uses me for sex when he wants.
00:45:11.125,00:45:13.586,"Otherwise, I don't exist."
00:45:15.087,00:45:17.006,We should go to Outback tonight.
00:45:17.006,00:45:18.675,That would be nice.
00:45:18.675,00:45:22.387,"AMY: Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic."
00:45:22.387,00:45:25.640,I became someone I don't even like.
00:45:25.640,00:45:27.642,The kind of woman I used to mock.
00:45:27.642,00:45:29.561,You're out so much.
00:45:29.561,00:45:32.063,I know.
00:45:32.063,00:45:34.273,"I can't, I'm already late."
00:45:34.273,00:45:36.067,You would hate it.
00:45:36.067,00:45:39.195,It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends.
00:45:40.363,00:45:43.740,Do our code.
00:45:43.740,00:45:45.826,I thought we weren't gonna be that couple.
00:45:52.375,00:45:54.252,"Okay, bye."
00:45:56.003,00:45:59.006,"Hey, I've been thinking."
00:45:59.006,00:46:00.383,Something positive.
00:46:01.800,00:46:03.302,Maybe it's time.
00:46:04.262,00:46:06.097,Now is literally the worst time.
00:46:06.097,00:46:08.015,It would be a new start for us.
00:46:08.015,00:46:10.351,"And for me, I would have a real purpose here."
00:46:10.351,00:46:11.394,A child is not a hobby.
00:46:11.394,00:46:12.520,Not a hobby.
00:46:13.396,00:46:15.356,An inspiration.
00:46:15.356,00:46:18.568,We could have had this fight four hours ago. I'm late.
00:46:18.568,00:46:20.069,I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.
00:46:20.069,00:46:21.446,You really wanna be the couple that has a baby...
00:46:21.446,00:46:23.239,to save their marriage?
00:46:23.239,00:46:24.865,Save?
00:46:24.865,00:46:27.118,"Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!"
00:46:27.118,00:46:29.120,And you're gonna walk out the door now?
00:46:29.120,00:46:31.623,You're a fucking coward.
00:46:31.623,00:46:33.499,"No, it can't go on like this."
00:46:33.499,00:46:34.584,"Oh, really?"
00:46:34.584,00:46:36.294,I won't.
00:46:36.294,00:46:38.379,You won't?
00:46:38.379,00:46:39.464,It's not even close!
00:46:39.464,00:46:42.341,You stupid bitch!
00:46:42.341,00:46:45.595,AMY: What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me.
00:46:45.595,00:46:49.557,What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more.
00:46:49.557,00:46:52.685,What scared me was that I'd finally realized...
00:46:52.685,00:46:56.063,I am frightened of my own husband.
00:47:08.159,00:47:09.577,You want me to call for backup?
00:47:09.577,00:47:11.788,"Nah, I'll protect you."
00:47:19.378,00:47:20.755,GILPIN: Jesus.
00:47:25.968,00:47:29.138,They ought to burn this place down.
00:47:29.138,00:47:30.765,BONEY: Seems like folks are trying.
00:47:36.312,00:47:38.481,You really think this is anything?
00:47:38.481,00:47:40.817,Cross it off the list.
00:47:51.786,00:47:53.496,"Hey, Jason."
00:47:53.496,00:47:55.456,"What's up, Rhonda?"
00:47:55.456,00:47:58.626,...and dedicated to the proposition that all men...
00:47:58.626,00:48:00.002,Have you seen this girl around here?
00:48:00.002,00:48:01.420,JASON: Why do you ask?
00:48:01.420,00:48:03.005,She was reported missing.
00:48:06.384,00:48:08.302,"...and so dedicated, can long endure."
00:48:08.302,00:48:10.262,Yeah. I remember her.
00:48:10.262,00:48:12.223,What did she want?
00:48:13.974,00:48:15.309,She wanted a gun.
00:48:15.309,00:48:17.395,I told her it's not my thing.
00:48:17.395,00:48:20.481,"I felt bad, though."
00:48:20.481,00:48:21.524,She said it needed to be small...
00:48:21.524,00:48:24.026,so she could keep it close.
00:48:24.026,00:48:26.111,Are you sure this is her?
00:48:26.111,00:48:27.864,You don't forget a girl like that in here.
00:48:28.989,00:48:30.449,She was all in pink.
00:48:30.449,00:48:32.951,It was Valentine's Day.
00:48:36.288,00:48:39.041,"AMY: For Valentine's Day, I thought I'd buy a gun."
00:48:39.041,00:48:42.837,That is how crazy I've become.
00:48:42.837,00:48:47.049,Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce.
00:48:47.049,00:48:50.803,"In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar, his only line of credit."
00:48:50.803,00:48:52.263,The bitch with the prenup.
00:48:54.181,00:48:56.684,I could go home to my parents...
00:48:56.684,00:48:59.228,but I'd have to tell them the truth.
00:48:59.228,00:49:03.190,And I don't even know if I believe the truth.
00:49:03.190,00:49:06.444,Can I really think Nick would hurt me?
00:49:06.444,00:49:08.738,I'm being paranoid. Crazy.
00:49:10.072,00:49:12.032,It's just...
00:49:12.032,00:49:14.535,I'd sleep better with a gun.
00:49:25.296,00:49:27.298,"NICK: Oh, shit."
00:49:27.298,00:49:30.468,My sister's gonna come out here.
00:49:34.889,00:49:36.973,Sorry to rush you.
00:49:39.101,00:49:40.770,Here. Let me help you.
00:49:40.770,00:49:42.688,Just get that.
00:49:45.190,00:49:46.651,Be very careful.
00:49:47.485,00:49:48.694,I'm all right.
00:49:48.694,00:49:51.447,Here you go.
00:49:51.447,00:49:53.365,Promise me we'll talk every day.
00:49:53.365,00:49:54.742,"Okay, we will."
00:49:54.742,00:49:57.202,"Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy."
00:49:58.036,00:49:59.204,Don't go crazy.
00:49:59.204,00:50:00.372,Okay.
00:50:04.794,00:50:08.506,GO: You fucking idiot.
00:50:08.506,00:50:11.884,You fucking asshole!
00:50:13.678,00:50:15.680,I'm sorry.
00:50:16.764,00:50:18.307,How old is she?
00:50:18.307,00:50:19.391,She's in her early 20s.
00:50:20.225,00:50:21.894,How long?
00:50:21.894,00:50:23.187,A year and a half.
00:50:23.187,00:50:24.939,You lied to me for over a year?
00:50:24.939,00:50:26.565,"Oh, if I told you, you would have made me stop."
00:50:26.565,00:50:28.066,It's so fucking small.
00:50:28.066,00:50:31.111,You're a liar and a cheat!
00:50:31.111,00:50:32.488,How did you even meet her?
00:50:32.488,00:50:35.073,She's one of my students.
00:50:35.073,00:50:37.576,I thought writers hated cliches.
00:50:37.576,00:50:39.912,"Oh, boo-hoo, I got laid off."
00:50:39.912,00:50:42.707,"It wasn't like that, okay?"
00:50:42.707,00:50:44.625,how fucking terrible she made me feel.
00:50:44.625,00:50:47.920,Flyover Boy.
00:50:47.920,00:50:49.755,"just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there..."
00:50:49.755,00:50:51.716,"dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door."
00:50:51.716,00:50:53.300,This is so bad.
00:50:53.300,00:50:55.427,"If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked."
00:50:55.427,00:50:58.014,Boney found a pair of panties in my office...
00:50:58.014,00:51:00.016,"where, occasionally, Andie and I..."
00:51:00.016,00:51:01.308,I don't know what the fuck it means.
00:51:01.308,00:51:02.351,Are they Super-Twat's?
00:51:02.351,00:51:04.478,Her name is Andie.
00:51:04.478,00:51:06.188,She's not entirely sure.
00:51:06.188,00:51:08.064,So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...
00:51:08.064,00:51:09.567,who isn't sure where she leaves her undies?
00:51:09.567,00:51:11.736,"If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's..."
00:51:11.736,00:51:13.445,and she left them there for me to find.
00:51:13.445,00:51:15.280,"Nick, I was scared for you before..."
00:51:15.280,00:51:17.449,"and now, I'm fucking petrified."
00:51:17.449,00:51:19.618,We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife...
00:51:19.618,00:51:22.538,"and this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye!"
00:51:22.538,00:51:24.498,Can you imagine?
00:51:24.498,00:51:27.752,Have you watched television lately?
00:51:27.752,00:51:31.505,Cable news is all over your shit.
00:51:31.505,00:51:34.050,"I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?"
00:51:34.050,00:51:35.801,His wife's nowhere to be found...
00:51:35.801,00:51:38.136,"and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting."
00:51:38.136,00:51:39.179,"Cute pic, huh?"
00:51:39.179,00:51:40.681,Who is that?
00:51:40.681,00:51:42.058,Some fucking tragedy groupie.
00:51:42.058,00:51:43.976,Who the fuck is that?
00:51:43.976,00:51:45.561,She was trying to give me a casserole.
00:51:45.561,00:51:48.439,"On the show today we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt..."
00:51:48.439,00:51:51.191,patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.
00:51:51.191,00:51:54.653,"Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider defending Nick Dunne?"
00:51:54.653,00:51:56.280,"TANNER: Well, let me just say..."
00:51:56.280,00:51:58.574,"as always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome."
00:51:58.574,00:52:00.367,"But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne."
00:52:00.367,00:52:02.912,"Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping..."
00:52:02.912,00:52:04.705,that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.
00:52:04.705,00:52:08.166,"Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath is a lack of empathy."
00:52:08.166,00:52:10.210,"TANNER: But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath..."
00:52:10.210,00:52:12.254,to behave normally in this situation...
00:52:12.254,00:52:15.007,because it's the most abnormal situation in the world.
00:52:15.007,00:52:17.635,"Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo..."
00:52:17.635,00:52:20.012,is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior?
00:52:20.012,00:52:22.431,I'm so sick of being picked apart by women.
00:52:23.808,00:52:25.768,You need to hire Tanner Bolt.
00:52:27.603,00:52:28.813,I don't deserve this.
00:52:28.813,00:52:30.731,Innocent until proven guilty.
00:52:30.731,00:52:32.984,That's exactly what you deserve.
00:52:32.984,00:52:34.485,"Go home, Nick."
00:53:00.427,00:53:01.804,"Hey, buddy."
00:53:18.070,00:53:19.864,GILPIN: I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy.
00:53:19.864,00:53:21.866,BONEY: We're not gonna arrest anybody...
00:53:21.866,00:53:23.784,just because some blonde dunce says so.
00:53:23.784,00:53:26.495,Why are you going so easy on him?
00:53:26.495,00:53:29.999,"One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witch-hunt."
00:53:29.999,00:53:31.917,"And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever."
00:53:31.917,00:53:33.169,She was trying to buy a gun.
00:53:33.169,00:53:35.211,"We don't know who or what was scaring her, Gil."
00:53:35.211,00:53:36.922,Give me the update.
00:53:36.922,00:53:39.550,"No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list."
00:53:39.550,00:53:41.552,I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father.
00:53:41.552,00:53:44.220,"The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten, so cross that off the list."
00:53:44.220,00:53:46.264,Hey.
00:53:46.264,00:53:48.809,"So, luminol lit up the kitchen like the 4th of July."
00:53:48.809,00:53:50.226,Whoa.
00:53:50.226,00:53:51.896,DONNELLY: The blood is profuse.
00:53:51.896,00:53:53.647,"It is Amy's, type B, and we should have DNA soon."
00:53:53.647,00:53:55.191,BONEY: Thoughts on a weapon?
00:53:55.191,00:53:56.859,DONNELLY: Trajectory indicates blunt force.
00:53:56.859,00:53:59.737,Maybe a club or a two-by-four.
00:53:59.737,00:54:02.948,"She fell there, but I doubt she got back up."
00:54:02.948,00:54:04.533,Amy's medical records come in?
00:54:04.533,00:54:06.368,"No, we'll have them later tonight."
00:54:08.037,00:54:09.621,My wife says he's a killer.
00:54:09.621,00:54:11.832,"Well, if Tiffany says..."
00:54:37.441,00:54:38.859,Hey.
00:54:38.859,00:54:40.152,Hey.
00:54:44.406,00:54:45.908,NICK: Thank you all for coming out.
00:54:47.159,00:54:48.744,"Hey Donnie, how are you?"
00:54:48.744,00:54:52.039,"Rich, thank you so much."
00:54:59.504,00:55:01.006,NICK: Hey.
00:55:07.638,00:55:09.098,"Thank you, folks."
00:55:09.098,00:55:11.183,Thank you for being here tonight.
00:55:11.183,00:55:13.351,It just means the world to our family.
00:55:13.351,00:55:14.770,And to Amy.
00:55:15.437,00:55:18.482,As you all know...
00:55:18.482,00:55:21.610,"my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne..."
00:55:21.610,00:55:23.988,disappeared three days ago.
00:55:23.988,00:55:27.491,And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all...
00:55:27.491,00:55:30.410,please come forward.
00:55:30.410,00:55:32.663,So hot.
00:55:32.663,00:55:34.957,I wanna say something...
00:55:34.957,00:55:36.292,because I think some of you might be wondering...
00:55:36.292,00:55:38.794,and are too polite to ask.
00:55:38.794,00:55:42.338,I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife.
00:55:42.338,00:55:44.340,I'm cooperating with the police.
00:55:44.340,00:55:46.426,I haven't hired a lawyer.
00:55:46.426,00:55:48.720,I have nothing to hide.
00:55:48.720,00:55:51.389,Amy is my soul mate.
00:55:51.389,00:55:53.433,She is brilliant...
00:55:53.433,00:55:56.728,"she's charming, and wise."
00:55:56.728,00:55:58.438,"I love you, Amy."
00:56:05.154,00:56:07.239,I love my wife...
00:56:07.239,00:56:08.615,so much.
00:56:11.409,00:56:16.081,And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to...
00:56:16.081,00:56:19.417,"and if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay."
00:56:19.417,00:56:23.088,"But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me..."
00:56:23.088,00:56:26.133,but don't harass the people of this town.
00:56:26.133,00:56:28.010,"If you need to mock somebody, mock me."
00:56:29.887,00:56:31.513,But please don't turn this investigation into a circus.
00:56:31.513,00:56:33.057,"Where's your wife, Nick?"
00:56:33.057,00:56:35.017,Let the police do their jobs.
00:56:35.017,00:56:36.601,What did you do to your pregnant wife?
00:56:38.562,00:56:40.189,"NOELLE: Did you tell them that, Nick?"
00:56:40.189,00:56:41.815,Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant?
00:56:45.652,00:56:47.696,Thank you for your support tonight.
00:56:50.074,00:56:51.158,"Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something."
00:56:55.453,00:56:56.788,"Gil, go, go."
00:56:59.333,00:57:00.542,"MAN 1: Nick, where are you going?"
00:57:00.542,00:57:02.169,MAN 2: Stop him!
00:57:02.169,00:57:04.255,GILPIN: No questions right now.
00:57:07.007,00:57:08.300,MAN 3: Why are you running away?
00:57:09.551,00:57:10.677,MAN 4: Don't run.
00:57:11.929,00:57:13.347,"Everybody, stay back."
00:57:17.935,00:57:20.187,"Guys, come on."
00:57:20.187,00:57:22.564,"Get off the grass, get down to the curb."
00:57:22.564,00:57:23.774,"Hey, Gil..."
00:57:23.774,00:57:24.983,All right.
00:57:24.983,00:57:26.818,"All right, y'all heard her."
00:57:26.818,00:57:27.986,Hello?
00:57:28.862,00:57:30.114,Hello?
00:57:30.114,00:57:31.448,Fuck.
00:57:31.448,00:57:32.866,You scared me.
00:57:32.866,00:57:34.576,Did you know she was pregnant?
00:57:34.576,00:57:36.494,"I told you, Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy."
00:57:36.494,00:57:38.372,She doesn't even know Amy.
00:57:38.372,00:57:39.748,They look like pretty good friends to me.
00:57:47.339,00:57:49.258,"Look, I don't know."
00:57:49.258,00:57:50.884,But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.
00:57:50.884,00:57:52.261,We have her medical records coming.
00:57:52.261,00:57:54.096,Good.
00:57:54.096,00:57:56.432,Let's start over here.
00:57:56.432,00:57:59.310,"You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions."
00:57:59.310,00:58:01.561,Dozens and dozens.
00:58:01.561,00:58:03.730,"This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it."
00:58:03.730,00:58:09.069,The whole thing looked staged.
00:58:09.069,00:58:12.614,"And yet, they remained upright throughout this life-and-death struggle?"
00:58:12.614,00:58:14.241,I don't know.
00:58:14.241,00:58:16.201,Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing?
00:58:16.201,00:58:19.330,No.
00:58:19.330,00:58:22.207,"And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up."
00:58:22.207,00:58:24.209,"Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick."
00:58:24.209,00:58:25.336,"Oh, my God."
00:58:25.336,00:58:26.962,"Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up."
00:58:26.962,00:58:29.173,Oh... Wait a second.
00:58:29.173,00:58:30.966,if they're trying to stage a crime scene?
00:58:30.966,00:58:33.635,No blood and no body suggests kidnapping.
00:58:33.635,00:58:36.221,"It tells us, look at people outside the house."
00:58:36.221,00:58:37.555,Like these homeless you keep mentioning.
00:58:37.555,00:58:40.725,A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide.
00:58:40.725,00:58:42.769,It tells us to look at people inside the house.
00:58:42.769,00:58:43.979,"Which is what we're doing here, Nick."
00:58:43.979,00:58:45.689,I see.
00:58:45.689,00:58:47.065,"BONEY: So, how was your marriage, Nick?"
00:58:47.065,00:58:48.442,"Because right now, all we got is Noelle."
00:58:48.442,00:58:49.943,"She says, Not good."
00:58:49.943,00:58:51.611,"Gil, what do you and your wife argue about?"
00:58:51.611,00:58:53.822,What pisses you off?
00:58:53.822,00:58:55.573,"BONEY: Me and my ex, it's the same."
00:58:55.573,00:58:59.036,"I mention that because we got a look at your finances, Nick."
00:58:59.036,00:59:01.830,"$117,000 in credit card debt."
00:59:01.830,00:59:03.832,What?
00:59:03.832,00:59:05.876,There are these fun little splurges.
00:59:05.876,00:59:07.336,NICK: I didn't buy any of this stuff.
00:59:07.336,00:59:08.545,I don't even golf!
00:59:08.545,00:59:09.796,I do!
00:59:09.796,00:59:11.215,I like the robot dog.
00:59:11.215,00:59:13.091,This is identity theft!
00:59:13.091,00:59:14.926,We need to find out who did this!
00:59:14.926,00:59:16.387,All right.
00:59:16.387,00:59:18.555,"Because in April, you bumped up Amy's life insurance..."
00:59:18.555,00:59:19.848,to $1.2 million.
00:59:19.848,00:59:21.933,"Yes, I did."
00:59:21.933,00:59:23.227,You filed the paperwork.
00:59:23.227,00:59:24.769,Because she told me to!
00:59:24.769,00:59:26.230,Hold on a sec.
00:59:26.230,00:59:27.814,Yeah? Okay.
00:59:29.858,00:59:31.360,For sure?
00:59:31.360,00:59:33.362,All right.
00:59:36.573,00:59:37.699,She was pregnant.
00:59:41.745,00:59:43.621,This is insane.
00:59:43.621,00:59:48.960,"So, my question becomes-- I don't want to talk to you again, ever..."
00:59:48.960,00:59:50.462,without a lawyer.
00:59:58.303,00:59:59.430,MALE REPORTER: Margo!
01:00:10.190,01:00:11.275,Hey.
01:00:13.902,01:00:16.071,NICK: Just hold on a second.
01:00:16.071,01:00:17.697,Nick?
01:00:17.697,01:00:20.242,"NICK: I hear you, I hear you."
01:00:17.697,01:00:24.288,I was as surprised as-- I know you're upset.
01:00:24.288,01:00:32.045,"Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't-- You want to know the truth?"
01:00:32.045,01:00:34.339,"The truth is, Amy didn't want kids."
01:00:36.800,01:00:42.431,"Well, I'm as surprised as-- You told me you didn't want kids."
01:00:42.431,01:00:44.475,to put a good face on.
01:00:44.475,01:00:46.393,"Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife."
01:00:46.393,01:00:48.145,That's a problem for you.
01:00:48.145,01:00:50.981,Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend.
01:00:50.981,01:00:52.399,"Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!"
01:00:52.399,01:00:53.609,You have to fucking talk to me!
01:00:56.403,01:00:58.905,I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids...
01:00:58.905,01:01:00.491,because she didn't want me to.
01:01:00.491,01:01:01.950,Because it would have just been...
01:01:01.950,01:01:03.494,another reason for you to hate her.
01:01:03.494,01:01:04.786,And we had enough of those already!
01:01:03.494,01:01:07.122,It was easier to just-- Lie to me?
01:01:07.122,01:01:09.124,"When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic!"
01:01:09.124,01:01:10.875,It didn't work?
01:01:10.875,01:01:13.003,Masturbate.
01:01:13.003,01:01:14.338,"for Amy to do her thing, all of a sudden it was like..."
01:01:14.338,01:01:15.755,"Well, I don't know."
01:01:15.755,01:01:17.132,"Now, who would believe you?"
01:01:18.258,01:01:19.593,All right.
01:01:29.227,01:01:31.271,This is a letter from the clinic...
01:01:31.271,01:01:33.440,notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample...
01:01:33.440,01:01:35.526,unless I contact them.
01:01:36.734,01:01:38.445,"So, I gave it to Amy."
01:01:38.445,01:01:41.532,"The next day, I saw it in the trash."
01:01:41.532,01:01:43.033,"But you were already with Andie by then, right?"
01:01:43.033,01:01:45.910,I wanted a baby with Amy.
01:01:45.910,01:01:47.871,"A year ago, Amy being pregnant..."
01:01:47.871,01:01:49.956,would have been the best thing ever!
01:01:56.796,01:01:59.966,"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just-- This is the clue you couldn't solve."
01:01:59.966,01:02:01.051,Yeah.
01:02:02.844,01:02:04.638,A letter from Desi.
01:02:04.638,01:02:06.764,That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?
01:02:06.764,01:02:08.850,It was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her.
01:02:08.850,01:02:10.561,It just kept hanging over my head.
01:02:10.561,01:02:12.020,Your prenup?
01:02:12.020,01:02:13.813,"Nick, why have you kept this stuff?"
01:02:13.813,01:02:15.023,It's like a little box of hate.
01:02:15.023,01:02:16.608,"I don't know, Go!"
01:02:19.611,01:02:22.822,I love you no matter what.
01:02:22.822,01:02:24.366,But you need to tell me.
01:02:24.366,01:02:25.701,Tell you what?
01:02:26.410,01:02:28.036,What are you asking me?
01:02:29.913,01:02:33.458,"Are you asking me if I killed my wife, Go?"
01:02:33.458,01:02:35.627,Is that what you're asking me?
01:02:35.627,01:02:37.713,I would never ask you that!
01:02:41.841,01:02:42.967,ALL REPORTERS: Margo!
01:02:55.564,01:02:58.275,Don't walk on the glass.
01:02:59.443,01:03:02.153,"You have no clue, do you?"
01:03:20.088,01:03:21.632,BONEY: Why was he here that night?
01:03:23.341,01:03:26.052,His wife is missing.
01:03:27.471,01:03:28.555,"Rhonda, we got this."
01:03:28.555,01:03:30.641,Let's make the arrest.
01:03:30.641,01:03:31.975,Do you know how hard it is to make a murder case without a body?
01:03:31.975,01:03:33.310,No.
01:03:33.310,01:03:35.562,"Well, it's incredibly hard."
01:03:35.562,01:03:38.356,"So, I want one last thing."
01:03:38.356,01:03:39.650,What's that?
01:03:41.025,01:03:44.571,I want a body.
01:03:44.571,01:03:48.908,"AMY: Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad."
01:03:48.908,01:03:50.535,GILPIN: Be careful.
01:03:55.373,01:03:59.503,"AMY: I need to be punished, and by punished, I mean had."
01:04:04.174,01:04:05.467,Fuck.
01:04:07.385,01:04:09.763,AMY: It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.
01:04:11.222,01:04:13.475,"So, open the door..."
01:04:13.475,01:04:14.726,Punish. Wood. Beach.
01:04:14.726,01:04:17.187,AMY: ...and look alive.
01:04:20.273,01:04:22.818,Punish. Wood.
01:04:24.194,01:04:25.779,Wood.
01:04:58.019,01:05:00.564,AMY: I will practice believing my husband loves me...
01:05:00.564,01:05:03.941,and will love this baby.
01:05:03.941,01:05:07.278,That this child might really save our marriage.
01:05:08.279,01:05:09.698,But I could be wrong.
01:05:15.829,01:05:17.789,Because sometimes...
01:05:18.707,01:05:20.834,the way he looks at me...
01:05:22.085,01:05:23.837,I think...
01:05:23.837,01:05:25.338,man of my dreams...
01:05:26.840,01:05:29.676,father of my child...
01:05:29.676,01:05:33.764,this man of mine may kill me.
01:05:35.139,01:05:36.974,He may truly...
01:05:37.684,01:05:38.810,kill me.
01:05:41.479,01:05:42.564,WTF?
01:06:07.923,01:06:10.216,AMY: I am so much happier now that I'm dead.
01:06:15.430,01:06:17.724,"Technically, missing."
01:06:17.724,01:06:19.768,Soon to be presumed dead.
01:06:21.185,01:06:23.521,Gone.
01:06:23.521,01:06:26.608,"And my lazy, lying, cheating, oblivious husband..."
01:06:26.608,01:06:29.820,will go to prison for my murder.
01:06:31.112,01:06:33.824,Nick Dunne took my pride and my dignity...
01:06:33.824,01:06:36.534,and my hope and my money.
01:06:36.534,01:06:39.788,He took and took from me until I no longer existed.
01:06:39.788,01:06:41.372,That's murder.
01:06:41.372,01:06:44.835,Let the punishment fit the crime.
01:06:44.835,01:06:47.671,"To fake a convincing murder, you have to have discipline."
01:06:51.883,01:06:54.719,You befriend a local idiot.
01:06:58.556,01:07:02.310,Harvest the details of her humdrum life.
01:07:02.310,01:07:06.898,And cram her with stories about your husband's violent temper.
01:07:06.898,01:07:09.359,Secretly create some money troubles.
01:07:09.359,01:07:12.403,"Credit cards, perhaps online gambling."
01:07:15.072,01:07:17.408,With the help of the unwitting...
01:07:17.408,01:07:19.243,bump up your life insurance.
01:07:21.037,01:07:24.290,Purchase getaway car.
01:07:24.290,01:07:28.252,Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.
01:07:28.252,01:07:32.841,You need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss.
01:07:32.841,01:07:36.219,And America loves pregnant women.
01:07:36.219,01:07:39.014,As if it's so hard to spread your legs.
01:07:39.014,01:07:40.765,You know what's hard?
01:07:40.765,01:07:42.767,Faking a pregnancy.
01:07:42.767,01:07:45.269,"First, drain your toilet."
01:07:46.855,01:07:49.566,Invite pregnant idiot into your home...
01:07:49.566,01:07:51.735,and ply her with lemonade.
01:07:57.156,01:07:59.158,Steal pregnant idiot's urine.
01:08:01.452,01:08:03.914,Voila.
01:08:03.914,01:08:06.917,A pregnancy is now part of your legal medical record.
01:08:13.464,01:08:14.716,Happy anniversary.
01:08:17.719,01:08:20.430,Wait for your clueless husband...
01:08:20.430,01:08:22.139,to start his day.
01:08:23.600,01:08:25.268,Off he goes.
01:08:25.268,01:08:28.688,And the clock is ticking.
01:08:28.688,01:08:31.816,Meticulously stage your crime scene...
01:08:31.816,01:08:35.653,with just enough mistakes to raise the specter of doubt.
01:08:37.113,01:08:39.198,You need to bleed.
01:08:39.198,01:08:40.491,A lot.
01:08:41.034,01:08:42.660,"A lot, a lot."
01:08:45.997,01:08:48.666,A head wound kind of bleed.
01:08:48.666,01:08:50.877,A crime scene kind of bleed.
01:08:54.297,01:08:57.884,You need to clean poorly...
01:08:57.884,01:09:01.304,Clean and bleed.
01:09:01.304,01:09:03.681,And leave a little something behind.
01:09:04.181,01:09:07.811,A fire in July?
01:09:07.811,01:09:10.521,And because you're you...
01:09:10.521,01:09:12.857,You need a diary.
01:09:12.857,01:09:16.277,"Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story."
01:09:16.277,01:09:18.738,Start with the fairy tale early days.
01:09:18.738,01:09:21.116,Those are true.
01:09:21.116,01:09:23.326,You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.
01:09:23.326,01:09:26.913,"After that, you invent."
01:09:26.913,01:09:28.706,The abuse. The fear.
01:09:28.706,01:09:31.918,The threat of violence.
01:09:31.918,01:09:34.504,And Nick thought he was the writer.
01:09:34.504,01:09:35.713,Burn it just the right amount.
01:09:37.674,01:09:39.342,Make sure the cops will find it.
01:09:44.555,01:09:47.433,"Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt."
01:09:50.311,01:09:53.106,"And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick..."
01:09:53.106,01:09:55.775,"for killing his beautiful, pregnant wife."
01:09:55.775,01:09:58.569,"And after all the outrage, when I'm ready..."
01:09:58.569,01:10:00.321,I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills...
01:10:00.321,01:10:03.033,and a pocket full of stones.
01:10:03.033,01:10:05.827,"And when they find my body, they'll know..."
01:10:05.827,01:10:08.997,Nick Dunne dumped his beloved like garbage.
01:10:08.997,01:10:11.499,And she floated down past all the other...
01:10:11.499,01:10:14.752,"abused, unwanted, inconvenient women."
01:10:16.129,01:10:18.923,"Then, Nick will die, too."
01:10:18.923,01:10:20.800,Nick and Amy will be gone.
01:10:20.800,01:10:23.011,"But, then, we never really existed."
01:10:23.011,01:10:26.347,Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be.
01:10:26.347,01:10:27.932,Cool Girl.
01:10:27.932,01:10:31.644,Men always use that as their defining compliment.
01:10:31.644,01:10:33.646,She's a cool girl.
01:10:33.646,01:10:34.856,Cool Girl is hot.
01:10:34.856,01:10:36.315,Cool Girl is game.
01:10:36.315,01:10:37.859,Cool Girl is fun.
01:10:37.859,01:10:40.236,Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.
01:10:40.236,01:10:43.614,"She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner..."
01:10:43.614,01:10:46.367,and then presents her mouth for fucking.
01:10:46.367,01:10:48.661,She likes what he likes.
01:10:48.661,01:10:53.332,"So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga."
01:10:53.332,01:10:56.753,"If he likes Girls Gone Wild, she's a mall babe..."
01:10:56.753,01:11:00.548,who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.
01:11:00.548,01:11:04.135,"When I met Nick Dunne, I knew he wanted Cool Girl."
01:11:04.135,01:11:06.804,"And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try."
01:11:06.804,01:11:09.390,I wax-stripped my pussy raw.
01:11:09.390,01:11:12.852,I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies.
01:11:12.852,01:11:15.646,I ate cold pizza and remained a size two.
01:11:15.646,01:11:17.398,I blew him semi-regularly.
01:11:18.775,01:11:20.526,I lived in the moment.
01:11:20.526,01:11:23.696,I was fucking game.
01:11:23.696,01:11:26.574,I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.
01:11:26.574,01:11:29.994,Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed.
01:11:29.994,01:11:33.123,"A lightness, a humor, an ease."
01:11:33.123,01:11:36.333,But I made him smarter.
01:11:36.333,01:11:39.670,I inspired him to rise to my level.
01:11:39.670,01:11:43.466,I forged the man of my dreams.
01:11:46.052,01:11:48.972,We were happy pretending to be other people.
01:11:48.972,01:11:52.558,We were the happiest couple we knew.
01:11:52.558,01:11:55.895,And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest?
01:11:55.895,01:11:58.481,But Nick got lazy.
01:11:58.481,01:12:00.524,He became someone I did not agree to marry.
01:12:00.524,01:12:04.403,He actually expected me to love him unconditionally.
01:12:04.403,01:12:09.033,"Then he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country..."
01:12:09.033,01:12:12.787,"and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier..."
01:12:12.787,01:12:14.080,Cool Girl.
01:12:16.457,01:12:20.837,You think I'd let him destroy me and end up happier than ever?
01:12:20.837,01:12:22.880,No fucking way.
01:12:22.880,01:12:24.715,He doesn't get to win.
01:12:35.310,01:12:38.813,"My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy."
01:12:41.524,01:12:44.735,He needed to learn.
01:12:44.735,01:12:47.697,Grown-ups work for things.
01:12:47.697,01:12:49.699,Grown-ups pay.
01:12:51.117,01:12:53.661,Grown-ups suffer consequences.
01:12:56.914,01:12:58.916,Wait.
01:12:58.916,01:13:01.544,"I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me..."
01:13:01.544,01:13:03.129,or get angry.
01:13:04.630,01:13:06.132,Okay.
01:13:10.261,01:13:12.263,Is that all the stuff from the credit cards?
01:13:12.263,01:13:15.141,Where do you store goodies for anniversary five?
01:13:15.141,01:13:16.351,Wood.
01:13:16.351,01:13:17.434,Woodshed.
01:13:17.434,01:13:19.270,"Yeah, my woodshed."
01:13:19.270,01:13:21.772,That fucking bitch.
01:13:23.691,01:13:25.193,I thought-- It's all right.
01:13:25.193,01:13:26.610,"I would have, too."
01:13:30.073,01:13:31.366,What's that present?
01:13:31.366,01:13:33.076,I don't know.
01:13:33.076,01:13:34.869,Let's find out.
01:13:41.542,01:13:43.753,Dear Husband...
01:13:43.753,01:13:45.755,I know you think you're moving through this world unseen.
01:13:45.755,01:13:47.423,Don't believe that for a second.
01:13:47.423,01:13:48.966,"I know where you've been, and I know where you're going."
01:13:52.678,01:13:54.805,"For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip."
01:13:54.805,01:13:56.682,"Follow the river, up, up, up."
01:13:56.682,01:13:59.394,"Sit back and relax, because you are done."
01:13:59.394,01:14:00.770,"What's up, up river?"
01:14:00.770,01:14:03.064,Up the river. Prison.
01:14:03.064,01:14:04.982,Fucking crazy bitch.
01:14:04.982,01:14:06.817,That's what this is.
01:14:06.817,01:14:09.028,She's framing me for her murder.
01:14:09.028,01:14:10.446,You married a complete psychopath.
01:14:10.446,01:14:12.615,The morning of our anniversary...
01:14:12.615,01:14:17.036,I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
01:14:17.036,01:14:19.414,"I couldn't fake it for another year, another day."
01:14:19.414,01:14:20.581,Then what happened?
01:14:20.581,01:14:22.499,"Before I could say anything, she said..."
01:14:22.499,01:14:25.044,I need you to go somewhere and really think about our marriage.
01:14:25.044,01:14:26.421,She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.
01:14:26.421,01:14:27.588,So you'd have no alibi.
01:14:27.588,01:14:30.466,She stage-managed me.
01:14:30.466,01:14:34.137,She knew exactly what I would do.
01:14:34.137,01:14:35.554,"I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage."
01:14:35.554,01:14:37.265,I came back and decided I wanted a divorce.
01:14:37.265,01:14:40.226,And by the time you got home-- She was gone.
01:14:40.226,01:14:41.436,"Oh, you fuck!"
01:14:41.436,01:14:42.979,She's good.
01:14:44.147,01:14:46.190,Part of me was relieved...
01:14:46.190,01:14:48.401,when I thought she was gone.
01:14:52.822,01:14:54.531,Punch and Judy puppets.
01:14:57.660,01:15:00.663,"Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby."
01:15:00.663,01:15:03.040,So I'm Punch.
01:15:03.040,01:15:04.625,"We already knew that, Amy, what's your point?"
01:15:06.002,01:15:08.629,Does Missouri have the death penalty?
01:15:35.698,01:15:38.326,"GRETA: Hey, neighbor."
01:15:38.326,01:15:41.037,It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door.
01:15:41.037,01:15:43.873,"Well, I don't know how decent I feel."
01:15:43.873,01:15:45.333,"Well, as long as you don't own a python..."
01:15:45.333,01:15:46.834,and blast death metal at 4 AM...
01:15:46.834,01:15:48.919,we're gonna be best friends.
01:15:48.919,01:15:51.047,All right.
01:15:51.047,01:15:52.631,I'm Greta.
01:15:53.090,01:15:54.800,I'm Nancy.
01:15:54.800,01:15:56.511,Are you going to the marina?
01:15:56.511,01:15:58.095,"Oh, I'm sorry."
01:15:58.095,01:15:59.680,I've got work to do.
01:15:59.680,01:16:01.974,All right.
01:16:01.974,01:16:03.684,You will.
01:16:49.980,01:16:54.860,Come on. Show me that darling Nicky smile.
01:16:56.779,01:16:58.697,You asshole.
01:17:14.004,01:17:15.714,Hey.
01:17:18.342,01:17:20.136,Nancy.
01:17:22.430,01:17:25.475,Nancy.
01:17:25.475,01:17:27.560,It's hot again today.
01:17:29.812,01:17:32.273,"So, uh, where are you from?"
01:17:32.273,01:17:33.774,Let me guess.
01:17:36.360,01:17:37.528,Nebraska.
01:17:39.655,01:17:40.739,New Orleans.
01:17:44.494,01:17:46.912,"You know, I am an expert oiler."
01:17:46.912,01:17:48.664,"Oh, I just bet you are."
01:17:48.664,01:17:52.084,Lotions and balms.
01:17:52.084,01:17:54.003,I would hate for y'all to get tan lines.
01:17:54.003,01:17:56.797,So sweet.
01:17:56.797,01:17:59.509,Okay.
01:18:02.595,01:18:04.680,I see we have the same taste in men.
01:18:06.765,01:18:09.101,I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.
01:18:09.101,01:18:11.728,Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him.
01:18:12.980,01:18:14.982,Let me guess.
01:18:14.982,01:18:18.694,He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up.
01:18:18.694,01:18:21.197,"No, you don't seem like much of a talker."
01:18:21.197,01:18:22.990,"Oh, I got it."
01:18:22.990,01:18:25.159,You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank...
01:18:25.159,01:18:26.661,and he apologized to you by busting you a good one.
01:18:29.121,01:18:30.331,Worse.
01:18:30.331,01:18:32.333,Worse?
01:18:32.333,01:18:36.003,I went to the bar where he works to surprise him.
01:18:36.003,01:18:40.716,And out he comes with this girl who had no business being in a bar.
01:18:43.844,01:18:46.138,On the very first night that we met...
01:18:46.138,01:18:50.934,we walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered.
01:18:50.934,01:18:53.437,"And it was in the air, everywhere."
01:18:53.437,01:18:55.856,A sugar storm.
01:18:55.856,01:18:57.816,And before he kissed me...
01:18:57.816,01:18:59.860,he leaned in...
01:19:01.362,01:19:03.822,and did this.
01:19:14.291,01:19:15.376,And guess what.
01:19:15.376,01:19:17.169,GRETA: What?
01:19:17.169,01:19:18.671,He did the exact same thing with her.
01:19:23.133,01:19:25.928,That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard.
01:19:25.928,01:19:27.638,Thank you.
01:19:28.472,01:19:29.557,Wow.
01:19:42.945,01:19:44.238,Thanks very much.
01:19:50.745,01:19:52.955,"Well, we've gone mainstream."
01:20:08.804,01:20:11.766,"It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them."
01:20:11.766,01:20:13.768,Mr. Bolt.
01:20:15.770,01:20:17.438,Nick Dunne.
01:20:17.438,01:20:19.565,"I have been sitting by the phone, my friend."
01:20:23.068,01:20:24.403,I'm sorry.
01:20:24.403,01:20:26.530,Do you not believe me?
01:20:26.530,01:20:29.617,"No, I believe you."
01:20:29.617,01:20:33.704,I love it.
01:20:33.704,01:20:35.247,But you gotta have a grudging respect...
01:20:35.247,01:20:37.124,"for your wife at this point, right?"
01:20:37.124,01:20:38.626,Are you laughing me out of the building?
01:20:38.626,01:20:40.336,Are you kidding me?
01:20:40.336,01:20:41.962,I'm way in.
01:20:41.962,01:20:44.548,You came to the right guy.
01:20:44.548,01:20:47.884,"This is why I have a $100,000 retainer."
01:20:47.884,01:20:49.512,"$100,000?"
01:20:49.512,01:20:51.180,We'll figure something out.
01:20:51.180,01:20:52.515,I'll give you a special...
01:20:52.515,01:20:55.017,my wife is skilled in the art of vengeance rate.
01:20:55.017,01:20:56.352,Okay.
01:20:56.352,01:20:57.936,"So, what's the plan?"
01:20:57.936,01:20:59.855,"Well, right now, it's a he said, she said."
01:20:59.855,01:21:01.023,She's telling a better story.
01:21:01.023,01:21:02.566,"No, Nick."
01:21:02.566,01:21:04.694,She is telling the perfect story.
01:21:04.694,01:21:08.113,"So, we need to start today to prepare your defense, should we need it."
01:21:08.113,01:21:11.492,And if we decide to go with your version of-- The truth.
01:21:11.492,01:21:14.704,Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy.
01:21:14.704,01:21:16.831,Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart...
01:21:16.831,01:21:18.332,and see her for what she is...
01:21:18.332,01:21:20.793,which a mind-fucker of the first degree.
01:21:20.793,01:21:22.712,"Now, that is a huge realignment."
01:21:22.712,01:21:24.755,We'll need other voices besides yours.
01:21:24.755,01:21:26.841,There has to be someone out there that she's screwed with in the past.
01:21:26.841,01:21:28.467,There's a New York guy.
01:21:28.467,01:21:30.010,"O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara."
01:21:30.010,01:21:31.094,Eight years ago...
01:21:31.094,01:21:32.555,she pressed charges against him.
01:21:32.555,01:21:35.182,That should be easy to find.
01:21:35.182,01:21:38.686,"Um, ex-classmate, Desi Collings."
01:21:38.686,01:21:40.604,She said that he stalked her.
01:21:41.897,01:21:43.816,"You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract."
01:21:48.362,01:21:51.198,"I told you, you came to the right guy."
01:21:53.367,01:21:54.702,Apparently.
01:22:03.753,01:22:05.504,Tommy?
01:22:05.504,01:22:07.715,Yeah.
01:22:07.715,01:22:09.508,Thanks for seeing me.
01:22:12.010,01:22:14.263,"Um, you're gonna want a drink."
01:22:14.847,01:22:16.306,Yeah.
01:22:16.306,01:22:19.101,"NICK: So, she said you got physical with her."
01:22:19.101,01:22:22.104,"No, dude, she said I raped her."
01:22:22.104,01:22:25.274,"First degree, felony rape."
01:22:25.274,01:22:26.983,Did you do it?
01:22:26.983,01:22:28.193,Yeah.
01:22:28.193,01:22:30.905,I was looking at 30 years to life.
01:22:30.905,01:22:32.364,Did you get a trial?
01:22:32.364,01:22:34.700,Do I look like I would do well in the yard?
01:22:34.700,01:22:37.870,"I pled down, man."
01:22:37.870,01:22:39.747,That's something.
01:22:39.747,01:22:41.916,I've been unemployed for the last eight years...
01:22:41.916,01:22:43.751,because I have to write sexual offender on every job application.
01:22:43.751,01:22:45.085,I'm on a neighborhood watch list...
01:22:45.085,01:22:46.754,because I have to register as a predator.
01:22:46.754,01:22:48.297,I haven't had a date in almost a decade...
01:22:48.297,01:22:49.715,because if a girl googles me...
01:22:52.092,01:22:54.094,Could you walk me through what happened?
01:22:54.094,01:22:57.306,"I meet Amy at this party, you know?"
01:22:57.306,01:22:59.141,We click. She's perfect.
01:22:59.141,01:23:01.477,"She's beautiful, she's smart, she's well-read..."
01:23:01.477,01:23:03.646,she's got an ass like a 20-year-old stripper.
01:23:03.646,01:23:05.689,"I think, What's the catch?"
01:23:05.689,01:23:09.443,"A few months, it hits me."
01:23:09.443,01:23:12.571,"Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?"
01:23:12.571,01:23:16.199,She annexed me.
01:23:16.199,01:23:19.995,It was just too much.
01:23:19.995,01:23:22.080,And we must have gone 20 rounds over that.
01:23:22.080,01:23:26.251,"Ties. The whole thing just became-- So, you broke up with her."
01:23:26.251,01:23:28.838,"No, I just backed away."
01:23:28.838,01:23:31.340,Gave her some space.
01:23:31.340,01:23:33.258,So I thought.
01:23:33.258,01:23:35.886,"Then one night, Amy comes over to my place..."
01:23:35.886,01:23:38.597,with a bottle of bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love.
01:23:38.597,01:23:41.684,"And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles..."
01:23:41.684,01:23:45.270,"and she is kneeling down, and-- I'm sorry."
01:23:45.270,01:23:47.397,You had sex?
01:23:47.397,01:23:49.817,"It was rough, but she was screaming for it."
01:23:49.817,01:23:52.402,"Next morning, there's two cops at my door."
01:23:52.402,01:23:55.614,Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape.
01:23:55.614,01:23:58.617,"Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen."
01:23:58.617,01:24:02.120,"It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her."
01:24:02.120,01:24:03.998,Me!
01:24:03.998,01:24:05.708,"And then, guess what they find."
01:24:05.708,01:24:08.043,"Headboards of my bed, one on each side."
01:24:08.043,01:24:09.503,The ties you wouldn't wear.
01:24:09.503,01:24:11.505,You do know your wife.
01:24:11.505,01:24:13.340,Did you ever see her again?
01:24:13.340,01:24:15.342,"On TV, last week, with you."
01:24:15.342,01:24:16.844,"I thought, There's Amy."
01:24:16.844,01:24:20.681,She's graduated from being raped to being murdered.
01:24:22.098,01:24:23.183,Mmm!
01:24:24.685,01:24:25.644,"You been watching this, too?"
01:24:25.644,01:24:27.021,ELLEN: Last night's bombshell.
01:24:27.021,01:24:28.856,We just found out...
01:24:28.856,01:24:31.525,"Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed, pregnant when she went missing."
01:24:31.525,01:24:34.570,"Kelly Capitono, this makes me wanna throw up."
01:24:34.570,01:24:36.071,What is it about a pregnant woman...
01:24:36.071,01:24:37.573,a woman carrying life inside her...
01:24:37.573,01:24:39.199,that turns men into animals?
01:24:39.199,01:24:41.243,"KELLY: Ellen, this is an epidemic."
01:24:41.243,01:24:43.286,The third leading cause of death among pregnant women...
01:24:43.286,01:24:45.581,is homicide committed by a boyfriend or husband.
01:24:45.581,01:24:48.709,"Let's not forget about the wife, ever."
01:24:48.709,01:24:52.588,"Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend, Noelle Hawthorne."
01:24:52.588,01:24:54.840,"Thanks for being on the show, Noelle."
01:24:54.840,01:24:56.216,"Thank you, Ellen."
01:24:56.216,01:24:57.885,And let me just say this...
01:24:57.885,01:25:01.263,"Amy would have loved you, and all you do for women."
01:25:01.263,01:25:03.098,"Oh, that's nice."
01:25:03.098,01:25:04.600,"Why don't you tell us about your friend, Noelle?"
01:25:04.600,01:25:07.310,Amy was so nurturing.
01:25:07.310,01:25:09.605,"Oh, I'd love if just once, someone was like..."
01:25:09.605,01:25:10.773,She was a real rag.
01:25:13.817,01:25:16.111,She was beautiful and smart and kind.
01:25:16.111,01:25:18.238,Seems like a rich bitch to me.
01:25:18.238,01:25:21.033,What do you mean?
01:25:21.033,01:25:23.159,GRETA: I don't know.
01:25:25.203,01:25:27.623,"Spoiled rich girl, married a cheating asshole."
01:25:27.623,01:25:29.249,Paid the ultimate price.
01:25:29.249,01:25:31.126,NOELLE: The only secret was her husband.
01:25:31.126,01:25:32.335,We never met Nick.
01:25:32.335,01:25:34.170,He never introduced himself.
01:25:34.170,01:25:36.423,"ELLEN: Why was that, Noelle?"
01:25:36.423,01:25:38.174,I think we know why.
01:25:38.174,01:25:40.510,Because he had a violent temper.
01:25:40.510,01:25:41.678,A little harsh.
01:25:41.678,01:25:43.388,"That's life, baby."
01:25:43.388,01:25:44.890,He knew I'd have seen right through him.
01:25:45.515,01:25:47.017,Don't get me wrong.
01:25:47.017,01:25:48.894,I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.
01:25:48.894,01:25:52.272,"I'm just saying, there are consequences."
01:25:54.316,01:25:55.400,"Fuck, yeah."
01:25:55.400,01:25:57.945,She was so alone.
01:25:57.945,01:26:00.155,And she was so innocent.
01:26:00.155,01:26:03.617,"You're a good friend, Noelle."
01:26:03.617,01:26:04.701,Thanks for coming on.
01:26:04.701,01:26:06.328,Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.
01:26:06.328,01:26:08.705,Tanner Bolt landed me.
01:26:08.705,01:26:11.875,I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings on my way home.
01:26:11.875,01:26:13.877,"And, Go..."
01:26:13.877,01:26:17.673,"Tanner's retainer is $100,000."
01:26:17.673,01:26:19.967,That's just the retainer.
01:26:19.967,01:26:23.261,"Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings."
01:26:23.261,01:26:26.181,I'm approved for a second mortgage on the house.
01:26:26.181,01:26:28.058,Thank you.
01:26:28.058,01:26:29.143,I love you.
01:26:29.143,01:26:30.936,"I love you, too."
01:26:30.936,01:26:33.188,"Nick keeps his father, who has Alzheimer's, in a facility."
01:26:33.188,01:26:35.149,Number of times he visited last year?
01:26:35.149,01:26:37.109,"Oh, fuck!"
01:26:37.109,01:26:39.444,"His twin sister, Margo, well, she is a peach."
01:26:39.444,01:26:42.114,These two spend their days in the bar Amy bought them.
01:26:42.114,01:26:44.282,"Playing what, Lauren?"
01:26:44.282,01:26:45.450,What the fuck?
01:26:45.450,01:26:48.704,Twin siblings often enable and abet.
01:26:48.704,01:26:51.247,"While I never examined Nick, or his sister..."
01:26:51.247,01:26:53.583,"they both seem very, very close."
01:26:53.583,01:26:55.335,It's twin-cest.
01:26:55.335,01:26:58.254,"Disturbingly close, Lauren."
01:26:58.254,01:27:00.049,"And so, we close with a question."
01:27:00.049,01:27:01.800,What kind of moral rot...
01:27:01.800,01:27:06.722,"allows a beautiful, talented, kind, smart, loving mother..."
01:27:06.722,01:27:10.184,to vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries?
01:27:10.184,01:27:11.977,Can I bum a cigarette?
01:27:11.977,01:27:15.564,"Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you, and we will not forget."
01:27:15.564,01:27:17.900,And you know what else we won't forget?
01:27:17.900,01:27:20.152,Missouri has the death penalty.
01:27:20.152,01:27:21.486,Amen.
01:27:47.387,01:27:49.598,I'd like to report some strange activity...
01:27:49.598,01:27:52.809,near the woodshed on the property of one Margo Dunne.
01:28:33.976,01:28:35.644,Hey.
01:28:41.275,01:28:42.400,Mr. Dunne.
01:28:42.400,01:28:44.653,Mr. Collings.
01:28:44.653,01:28:47.572,I know you.
01:28:47.572,01:28:49.950,I wanted to help.
01:28:49.950,01:28:51.868,"Well, I hope you don't mind me coming by."
01:28:51.868,01:28:55.831,I got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife.
01:28:55.831,01:28:59.501,Amy and I believe in the lost art of letter-writing.
01:28:59.501,01:29:02.963,I always wondered why you kept in touch after...
01:29:03.755,01:29:05.423,everything.
01:29:05.423,01:29:07.717,"You were together for two years in boarding school, right?"
01:29:07.717,01:29:09.761,She was my first serious girlfriend.
01:29:09.761,01:29:11.263,Why did you break up?
01:29:11.263,01:29:12.764,That's a strange question.
01:29:12.764,01:29:14.724,Did you treat her bad?
01:29:14.724,01:29:16.059,That's a rude question.
01:29:16.059,01:29:17.727,Let me tell you what Amy told me.
01:29:17.727,01:29:20.772,"She dumped you, you completely unraveled."
01:29:20.772,01:29:22.899,"You stalked her, you threatened her..."
01:29:22.899,01:29:26.320,and you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized.
01:29:26.320,01:29:30.282,"Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this?"
01:29:30.282,01:29:32.408,I thought there might be another side to this story.
01:29:36.121,01:29:37.789,Mr. Collings.
01:29:40.042,01:29:41.751,Fuck.
01:29:47.966,01:29:50.760,...the missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.
01:29:50.760,01:29:52.971,She is the beautiful blonde inspiration...
01:29:52.971,01:29:54.181,for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.
01:30:11.614,01:30:13.616,You're reading that diary again?
01:30:13.616,01:30:14.743,You know how it ends.
01:30:14.743,01:30:17.371,It interests me.
01:30:17.371,01:30:18.872,"Hey, Rhonda."
01:30:18.872,01:30:21.083,He's gonna kill me.
01:30:21.083,01:30:23.043,Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?
01:30:23.043,01:30:24.253,It's private.
01:30:24.253,01:30:27.297,Why didn't he make sure it actually burned?
01:30:27.297,01:30:30.259,Because he tripped the alarm.
01:30:30.259,01:30:32.468,just feels hinky.
01:30:32.468,01:30:34.637,Like finding an envelope marked Clue.
01:30:34.637,01:30:35.931,You ever hear the expression...
01:30:35.931,01:30:38.267,The simplest answer is often the correct one?
01:30:38.267,01:30:40.269,"Actually, I've never found that to be true."
01:30:40.269,01:30:41.853,Good night.
01:30:44.606,01:30:45.690,Hey.
01:30:55.200,01:30:57.119,Elvis is in Missouri.
01:30:57.119,01:30:59.329,Thank God.
01:30:59.329,01:31:01.123,NICK: First thing you have to understand about Amy...
01:31:01.123,01:31:02.165,she loves to teach lessons.
01:31:02.165,01:31:03.625,Play God.
01:31:03.625,01:31:04.793,"Yeah, Old Testament God."
01:31:04.793,01:31:06.169,Okay. Keep talking.
01:31:06.169,01:31:07.629,She finds out I've been cheating on her with Andie...
01:31:07.629,01:31:09.339,decides to teach me a lesson.
01:31:09.339,01:31:11.300,"Fakes her own death, frames me for it."
01:31:11.300,01:31:13.593,"Blood in the house, credit cards, life insurance."
01:31:13.593,01:31:14.928,She does the treasure hunt.
01:31:14.928,01:31:16.138,"NICK: Now, the treasure hunt is critical."
01:31:16.138,01:31:18.390,She's taking us on a tour of my infidelities.
01:31:18.390,01:31:20.392,Rubbing my nose in it.
01:31:20.392,01:31:22.102,And she leaves clue number one for the police...
01:31:22.102,01:31:23.853,which will lead them back to my office...
01:31:23.853,01:31:26.273,which is a place where Andie and I would often...
01:31:26.273,01:31:27.481,And she leaves a pair of red panties.
01:31:27.481,01:31:28.775,"Right. Racy, looks bad."
01:31:28.775,01:31:30.693,Clue two.
01:31:30.693,01:31:31.945,Another place where Andie and I...
01:31:31.945,01:31:32.946,would occasionally have relations.
01:31:32.946,01:31:34.488,Clue three?
01:31:34.488,01:31:36.158,Also a location...
01:31:36.158,01:31:37.909,We had limited options.
01:31:37.909,01:31:39.202,Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
01:31:39.202,01:31:40.370,Put it on Andie's credit card.
01:31:40.370,01:31:41.997,Andie's statement went right to her parents.
01:31:41.997,01:31:44.291,Ew.
01:31:44.291,01:31:46.084,This leads us to what?
01:31:46.084,01:31:47.877,Dad's house is blue.
01:31:49.421,01:31:52.632,"After the divorce, when Dad wasn't coming around..."
01:31:52.632,01:31:57.220,"I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. Brown, who..."
01:31:57.220,01:32:00.474,"for the sake of his children's safety, had to deny their existence."
01:32:00.474,01:32:02.267,You never told me that.
01:32:02.267,01:32:04.269,You told her that?
01:32:04.269,01:32:06.813,We've got incriminating red panties in your office.
01:32:06.813,01:32:10.442,We've got a Showcase Showdown worth of crap in your woodshed.
01:32:10.442,01:32:13.445,"So, what in God's name is at your father's house, Nick?"
01:32:13.445,01:32:14.570,And be honest.
01:32:14.570,01:32:16.448,I honestly have no idea.
01:32:22.287,01:32:24.414,TANNER: Well...
01:32:24.414,01:32:27.334,"Whatever they found, I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad."
01:32:29.252,01:32:31.880,TANNER: We got a lot of uncontained issues here.
01:32:31.880,01:32:35.258,"Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is?"
01:32:35.258,01:32:37.802,"Well, we haven't communicated since the vigil."
01:32:37.802,01:32:39.304,Okay. Amy's parents?
01:32:39.304,01:32:40.805,"No, it's..."
01:32:40.805,01:32:42.349,"We got a hurt, young girlfriend..."
01:32:42.349,01:32:44.184,who will no doubt go public at any moment.
01:32:44.184,01:32:45.852,"No, Andie won't do that."
01:32:45.852,01:32:48.104,They always do.
01:32:48.104,01:32:50.482,Amy's got us in an interesting bind.
01:32:50.482,01:32:51.983,We need to tell the cops about Andie.
01:32:51.983,01:32:53.235,Really?
01:32:53.235,01:32:55.862,"Right now, Andie just gives you another motive."
01:32:55.862,01:32:57.197,We need to tell the cops about the woodshed.
01:32:57.197,01:32:58.781,We need to be on the front end of that.
01:32:58.781,01:33:01.535,But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen.
01:33:01.535,01:33:03.078,They'll go after Margo.
01:33:03.078,01:33:04.538,"They can't do that, can they?"
01:33:04.538,01:33:06.081,She's your accomplice.
01:33:06.081,01:33:07.749,"In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy."
01:33:08.833,01:33:10.793,"Oh, God."
01:33:10.793,01:33:12.670,"Well, what are we going to do?"
01:33:12.670,01:33:14.047,We find Amy.
01:33:14.047,01:33:16.508,No. Any other strategy is missing the point.
01:33:16.508,01:33:18.718,I've got two ex-Secret Service guys that are really good.
01:33:18.718,01:33:20.594,I'll put them on it.
01:33:20.594,01:33:22.305,"But where do they start, Nick?"
01:33:22.305,01:33:23.806,Where would Amy go?
01:33:25.434,01:33:27.060,I have no idea.
01:33:29.563,01:33:30.646,Oh!
01:33:31.523,01:33:34.109,Are we keeping score?
01:33:34.859,01:33:36.236,Hey!
01:33:38.113,01:33:41.074,I thought we were steering clear of men for a while.
01:33:41.074,01:33:42.158,He's nice.
01:33:42.158,01:33:44.618,Because he wants to fuck you.
01:33:46.288,01:33:47.830,She's still moping about her ex?
01:33:49.458,01:33:52.127,"He got cheated on, too."
01:33:55.755,01:33:58.425,We three are the saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.
01:33:58.425,01:34:00.510,I'm not sad.
01:34:00.510,01:34:01.595,I'm angry.
01:34:01.595,01:34:03.637,There you go.
01:34:03.637,01:34:06.475,I almost drank myself to death when my wife left me.
01:34:06.475,01:34:08.602,I was gonna kill myself.
01:34:08.602,01:34:09.936,Don't give him the pleasure.
01:34:09.936,01:34:12.981,I was going to drown myself in the Gulf of Mexico...
01:34:12.981,01:34:15.442,let myself be dinner for the great whites.
01:34:15.442,01:34:17.193,"Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins."
01:34:17.193,01:34:21.156,Why should I die?
01:34:21.156,01:34:23.575,Please put that on a T-shirt.
01:34:25.160,01:34:26.453,Oh!
01:34:32.417,01:34:34.503,Miss Moneybags.
01:34:36.004,01:34:37.213,That's a fat wad.
01:34:39.132,01:34:40.925,It's mostly singles.
01:34:40.925,01:34:43.761,Singles?
01:34:43.761,01:34:46.055,"Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?"
01:34:47.390,01:34:49.184,GRETA: We're just teasing.
01:34:49.184,01:34:50.768,Don't they tease people down in NOLA?
01:34:53.687,01:34:56.650,We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest any day now.
01:34:56.650,01:35:00.111,"We've got blood in the house, huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy."
01:35:00.111,01:35:04.199,"And we have Amy Elliott Dunne, missing for five days..."
01:35:04.199,01:35:06.201,crying out for justice.
01:35:07.076,01:35:08.828,We'll be right back.
01:36:01.256,01:36:03.341,Tanner has a very bad idea he's going to pitch you.
01:36:03.341,01:36:04.967,NICK: Yeah?
01:36:04.967,01:36:06.177,You're doing Sharon Schieber tomorrow in St. Louis.
01:36:06.177,01:36:07.387,It could go so wrong.
01:36:07.387,01:36:09.013,And you are going to tell her about Andie.
01:36:09.013,01:36:10.390,Nope.
01:36:10.390,01:36:12.475,That sounds like a very bad idea.
01:36:12.475,01:36:14.603,You haven't heard from her in three days.
01:36:14.603,01:36:18.314,This is a ticking time bomb.
01:36:18.314,01:36:19.441,People are gonna hate me.
01:36:19.441,01:36:21.109,"And then, they will forgive you."
01:36:21.109,01:36:23.361,A guy admitting that he's a gigantic asshole on television?
01:36:23.361,01:36:26.740,People empathize with that.
01:36:26.740,01:36:28.450,Why don't we just put out a statement?
01:36:28.450,01:36:31.578,"Sharon's specials, they get 10 million viewers."
01:36:31.578,01:36:34.038,She is a crusader.
01:36:31.578,01:36:36.249,If she takes you on as a cause-- She's going to ask real questions.
01:36:36.249,01:36:37.833,I will drill you as if you were doing a deposition.
01:36:37.833,01:36:39.461,"What to say, what not to say."
01:36:39.461,01:36:41.087,A trained monkey?
01:36:41.087,01:36:44.132,A trained monkey who doesn't get the lethal injection.
01:36:44.132,01:36:47.510,"Nick, this case is about what people think of you."
01:36:47.510,01:36:49.512,They need to like you.
01:36:49.512,01:36:52.890,"Now, you do this and you will reach millions of those people."
01:36:54.267,01:36:56.728,Maybe I only need to reach one.
01:37:05.945,01:37:07.071,Hello?
01:37:07.071,01:37:08.156,"GRETA: Hey, baby."
01:37:09.616,01:37:11.200,One minute.
01:37:20.042,01:37:21.336,Hey.
01:37:21.336,01:37:22.462,You clearing out?
01:37:22.462,01:37:24.547,"No, I'm just cleaning up."
01:37:24.547,01:37:26.090,Let us come in and say goodbye.
01:37:26.090,01:37:28.718,I'll come by before-- Let us give you a hand.
01:37:35.350,01:37:37.477,"Yeah, you gotta clear everything out, here."
01:37:39.228,01:37:41.690,Dorothy is a real stickler.
01:37:43.316,01:37:46.486,Not even a spare hanger can you leave behind.
01:37:49.113,01:37:50.490,Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.
01:37:53.201,01:37:54.494,A sock...
01:37:55.119,01:37:57.706,or undies or what have you.
01:38:02.752,01:38:04.003,You did a real good job.
01:38:06.130,01:38:08.132,"Where is the money, sweetheart?"
01:38:11.885,01:38:13.179,Look under her dress.
01:38:14.597,01:38:15.682,He talked you into this?
01:38:15.682,01:38:17.141,I talked him into it.
01:38:17.141,01:38:19.811,"The second you leave, I'm calling the cops."
01:38:19.811,01:38:23.690,Your glasses are fake.
01:38:23.690,01:38:26.609,"You say your name's Nancy, but you don't even answer to it half the time."
01:38:26.609,01:38:28.986,You're hiding.
01:38:28.986,01:38:31.406,But you ain't gonna call the cops.
01:38:31.406,01:38:33.241,And I don't think you've ever really been hit before.
01:38:33.241,01:38:34.534,Ow!
01:38:39.497,01:38:41.583,Holy shit.
01:38:44.836,01:38:47.630,"Sorry, but we really need the money."
01:38:47.630,01:38:49.883,"GRETA: Next place, be more careful, okay?"
01:38:49.883,01:38:51.801,There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are.
01:39:26.335,01:39:27.879,Excuse me.
01:39:55.448,01:39:59.535,I did not kill my wife.
01:39:59.535,01:40:02.705,Why don't you try it again?
01:40:02.705,01:40:04.206,I didn't kill my wife.
01:40:05.834,01:40:07.794,What are you doing?
01:40:07.794,01:40:10.171,"or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear."
01:40:10.171,01:40:12.173,That's supposed to make me less tense?
01:40:12.173,01:40:13.967,"Mr. Dunne, from what I understand..."
01:40:13.967,01:40:16.594,you and your wife had some bumps.
01:40:16.594,01:40:20.348,"Yeah, we had some tough years."
01:40:20.348,01:40:21.432,You both did.
01:40:24.268,01:40:26.395,We both lost our jobs.
01:40:26.395,01:40:28.898,I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother...
01:40:28.898,01:40:33.110,"who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had-- Your dad's scorched earth."
01:40:33.110,01:40:34.737,"Let's talk about your mom, how close you were."
01:40:34.737,01:40:35.989,Go on.
01:40:35.989,01:40:38.616,"For a while, things had been building up."
01:40:38.616,01:40:42.077,Built up implies that an explosion is coming. No.
01:40:42.077,01:40:44.413,"At a certain point, we got on the wrong track."
01:40:45.373,01:40:46.958,I had a moment of weakness.
01:40:46.958,01:40:49.335,Your moment was over 15 months.
01:40:53.214,01:40:55.925,I disrespected my wife.
01:40:55.925,01:40:58.761,And I disrespected my marriage.
01:40:58.761,01:41:00.137,And I'll always regret it.
01:41:00.722,01:41:02.891,That works.
01:41:02.891,01:41:04.433,"Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick."
01:41:04.433,01:41:05.977,I was an idiot.
01:41:05.977,01:41:07.269,Everything I do is wrong.
01:41:07.269,01:41:08.855,I know. What men are supposed to do in general.
01:41:10.982,01:41:12.483,Thank you.
01:41:12.483,01:41:16.069,I feel good.
01:41:16.069,01:41:18.364,It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me.
01:41:18.364,01:41:19.699,You hate that watch.
01:41:19.699,01:41:21.576,"No, Go."
01:41:21.576,01:41:23.619,Just like I love this tie.
01:41:23.619,01:41:26.622,Just like I love my wife.
01:41:57.236,01:41:58.487,It's you!
01:41:58.487,01:42:00.656,It's you.
01:42:04.159,01:42:05.411,I'm sorry.
01:42:06.245,01:42:08.289,Good God.
01:42:08.289,01:42:10.374,Last week...
01:42:10.374,01:42:14.169,"I threatened to leave, and he said he'd find me..."
01:42:14.169,01:42:15.755,and he'd kill me.
01:42:15.755,01:42:19.216,"So, I disappeared."
01:42:19.216,01:42:21.636,I lost the baby.
01:42:21.636,01:42:23.429,I couldn't even tell my parents.
01:42:23.429,01:42:27.976,and I'm so afraid.
01:42:27.976,01:42:30.019,"Well, he is looking for you."
01:42:30.019,01:42:31.813,He showed up on my doorstep three days ago.
01:42:31.813,01:42:34.231,He tracked me from my letters to you.
01:42:35.316,01:42:37.318,You saved them.
01:42:37.318,01:42:39.320,Knowing you were out there...
01:42:39.320,01:42:41.238,was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years.
01:42:41.238,01:42:42.531,Let's go to the police.
01:42:42.531,01:42:43.950,"No, I can't turn up now."
01:42:43.950,01:42:46.869,I'd be a pariah.
01:42:48.830,01:42:50.957,Is it wrong to want Nick to go prison?
01:42:50.957,01:42:52.834,He should go to prison for what he's done.
01:42:55.837,01:42:58.171,I'm setting you up at my lake house.
01:42:58.171,01:42:59.882,It's utterly secluded.
01:43:00.549,01:43:02.384,Why are you so good to me?
01:43:02.384,01:43:03.845,You know why.
01:43:03.845,01:43:05.096,Excuse me.
01:43:05.096,01:43:07.264,"-I know you, don't I?"
01:43:07.264,01:43:09.100,"You're one of the Nolan girls, right?"
01:43:09.100,01:43:11.769,"No, we're from Winnipeg."
01:43:11.769,01:43:12.854,We should leave.
01:43:12.854,01:43:14.689,Just a second.
01:43:14.689,01:43:17.817,That was Boney.
01:43:17.817,01:43:20.028,Tanner.
01:43:20.028,01:43:21.278,TANNER: Sharon! Hi.
01:43:21.278,01:43:22.905,Hope this is worth my while.
01:43:22.905,01:43:24.281,You're gonna be very happy.
01:43:24.281,01:43:25.741,Sharon.
01:43:25.741,01:43:28.077,Ms. Schieber.
01:43:28.077,01:43:29.662,Can I get you anything to drink or eat before we get started?
01:43:29.662,01:43:31.747,"No, I had some gummy bears."
01:43:32.748,01:43:34.333,What the fuck?
01:43:35.459,01:43:37.586,I'm sorry?
01:43:37.586,01:43:39.254,We have a major shocking development...
01:43:39.254,01:43:41.007,in the Amazing Amy disappearance.
01:43:41.007,01:43:42.299,We go live to that story now.
01:43:42.299,01:43:43.718,"Oh, my God."
01:43:45.845,01:43:47.638,You little slut.
01:43:47.638,01:43:50.725,My name is Andie Fitzgerald.
01:43:51.684,01:43:53.936,I met Nicholas Dunne...
01:43:53.936,01:43:57.148,when he was my creative writing teacher at Mill Valley.
01:43:57.148,01:43:59.274,Why is she dressed like a babysitter?
01:43:59.274,01:44:00.985,I am deeply ashamed...
01:44:00.985,01:44:04.197,of having been romantically involved with a married man.
01:44:04.197,01:44:05.907,The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.
01:44:05.907,01:44:08.241,I truly believed we were in love.
01:44:08.241,01:44:09.827,"Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite."
01:44:11.370,01:44:12.705,I know that is no excuse.
01:44:12.705,01:44:14.623,"No, it is not."
01:44:14.623,01:44:18.627,"I do not, in my heart, believe Nick Dunne would have killed for me."
01:44:18.627,01:44:20.963,My prayers go out to everyone who loves Amy.
01:44:20.963,01:44:23.799,I apologize for the pain this has caused them.
01:44:29.222,01:44:31.015,We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.
01:44:31.933,01:44:33.809,That love ended today.
01:44:33.809,01:44:35.352,"Come on, you're staring at ghosts."
01:44:35.352,01:44:38.355,He met our trust with lie after lie.
01:44:38.355,01:44:40.566,We now absolutely believe...
01:44:40.566,01:44:42.610,Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter.
01:44:42.610,01:44:46.030,Our Amazing Amy.
01:44:46.030,01:44:47.740,"Well, this just got very exciting."
01:44:48.574,01:44:50.283,We need a moment.
01:44:52.453,01:44:54.205,We're gonna have to bow out of this.
01:44:54.205,01:44:55.957,Nothing has changed.
01:44:55.957,01:44:58.500,"An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?"
01:44:58.500,01:45:00.086,I can handle this.
01:45:00.086,01:45:02.295,This is a completely different dynamic.
01:45:02.295,01:45:03.547,I can handle it.
01:45:03.547,01:45:04.799,She's going to eat you alive.
01:45:05.382,01:45:07.093,Just trust me.
01:45:11.430,01:45:12.932,Okay.
01:45:12.932,01:45:14.433,Great.
01:45:14.850,01:45:16.269,Mic him.
01:45:36.080,01:45:37.873,"One, two, three, four, five."
01:45:44.172,01:45:45.464,Thank you.
01:45:46.381,01:45:47.508,He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.
01:45:47.508,01:45:48.634,"Yeah, no kidding."
01:45:53.388,01:45:56.349,MAN: Roll tape.
01:45:56.349,01:45:57.977,three... two...
01:46:00.395,01:46:03.440,"GO: Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were."
01:46:03.440,01:46:04.817,Amy brings out the best in me.
01:46:04.817,01:46:06.485,"TANNER: Keep it together, you two."
01:46:06.485,01:46:08.112,At least for the next 24 hours.
01:46:08.112,01:46:09.280,People still hate you.
01:46:09.280,01:46:10.656,Women want to scratch your eyes out.
01:46:10.656,01:46:12.449,Andie was really good TV.
01:46:12.449,01:46:13.659,She's a good person.
01:46:13.659,01:46:15.744,Therein lies the problem.
01:46:15.744,01:46:18.539,"and when Sharon airs tomorrow, we'll be looking at a whole new you."
01:46:18.539,01:46:20.291,"But, until then..."
01:46:20.291,01:46:22.251,don't show your face.
01:46:22.251,01:46:23.919,No problem.
01:46:40.186,01:46:41.770,Welcome.
01:46:43.689,01:46:45.774,Make yourself at home.
01:46:45.774,01:46:49.444,"I've got music, satellite..."
01:46:49.444,01:46:50.487,Netflix.
01:46:50.487,01:46:51.572,He was her teacher!
01:46:51.572,01:46:53.366,Roku.
01:46:53.366,01:46:56.451,"Internet, obviously."
01:46:56.451,01:47:01.623,Here is a supposedly grown man-- DESI: If there is ever anything you have a taste for...
01:47:01.623,01:47:03.042,and you can't find it...
01:47:03.042,01:47:05.627,just let me know and I will get it for you.
01:47:05.627,01:47:08.839,"ELLEN: Instead of the A-B-C's, he taught her the birds and the bees."
01:47:08.839,01:47:11.508,And just think how her mother must feel at a time like this.
01:47:11.508,01:47:13.344,Wine cellar's downstairs.
01:47:16.847,01:47:18.349,"I'll get you some clothes, too."
01:47:18.349,01:47:23.104,Not that I don't appreciate Bait Shop Chic.
01:47:23.104,01:47:25.522,"The floors are heated, just dial to your liking."
01:47:25.522,01:47:28.817,There's robes and towels.
01:47:28.817,01:47:30.778,The bathtub has a massage cycle.
01:47:32.988,01:47:35.116,"There's a great view, if you're in the mood."
01:47:35.116,01:47:36.325,Blackout curtains if you're not.
01:47:36.325,01:47:38.953,The bed is Savoir.
01:47:38.953,01:47:41.122,You'll never get a better sleep.
01:47:42.290,01:47:43.374,Oh.
01:47:45.126,01:47:47.378,"Oh, this is just what I need."
01:47:48.837,01:47:50.798,I'm so exhausted.
01:47:52.383,01:47:54.427,"I'll leave you to it, then."
01:47:56.262,01:47:59.056,"Amy, I am so happy that you are here."
01:48:00.349,01:48:03.269,And I don't want you to worry for one moment.
01:48:03.269,01:48:05.478,There are cameras everywhere.
01:48:05.478,01:48:08.149,"The exterior, all along the grounds, the entryway."
01:48:08.149,01:48:09.358,Anyone...
01:48:09.358,01:48:11.484,who is caught coming or going...
01:48:14.738,01:48:16.824,will be recorded.
01:48:17.950,01:48:20.661,You are more than safe.
01:48:22.788,01:48:26.000,And I am not letting you get away again.
01:49:11.544,01:49:12.671,Good morning!
01:49:15.257,01:49:16.549,I'm sorry.
01:49:18.427,01:49:20.221,I need to feel safe.
01:49:20.221,01:49:23.057,You are very safe.
01:49:25.476,01:49:27.061,What have you been up to?
01:49:27.061,01:49:29.771,"Amy, I'm not Nick."
01:49:29.771,01:49:31.857,It's hard for me.
01:49:34.902,01:49:38.280,After so many years under someone's thumb...
01:49:40.741,01:49:43.035,I know just what that feels like.
01:49:43.035,01:49:45.496,You were never under my thumb.
01:49:45.496,01:49:47.373,On your leash.
01:49:47.373,01:49:48.832,A new start.
01:49:50.334,01:49:51.710,Decent clothes.
01:49:52.794,01:49:55.423,Hair dye. Makeup.
01:49:55.423,01:49:57.258,There's a gym overlooking the lake.
01:49:57.258,01:49:59.009,The sooner you look like yourself...
01:49:59.009,01:50:00.761,the sooner you'll feel like yourself.
01:50:00.761,01:50:02.430,I'll get groceries for tonight...
01:50:02.430,01:50:04.223,"we'll watch Sharon Schieber, and finally move on."
01:50:04.223,01:50:06.892,I think that's something I should watch on my own.
01:50:06.892,01:50:08.643,Nonsense.
01:50:12.314,01:50:13.690,I'll be back.
01:50:15.401,01:50:17.694,And I am looking forward...
01:50:17.694,01:50:20.364,to my reunion with Amy Elliott.
01:50:43.471,01:50:46.014,Great.
01:50:46.014,01:50:47.891,"Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber."
01:50:47.891,01:50:50.603,"Tonight, exclusively..."
01:50:50.603,01:50:52.438,A husband breaks his silence...
01:50:52.438,01:50:55.107,not just on his wife's disappearance...
01:50:55.107,01:50:58.693,"but on his infidelity, and all those shocking rumors."
01:51:01.280,01:51:02.990,Nick Dunne...
01:51:02.990,01:51:06.410,you're probably the most hated man in America right now.
01:51:06.410,01:51:08.954,I probably am.
01:51:08.954,01:51:10.747,I bought that tie.
01:51:10.747,01:51:12.583,"Did you kill your wife, Nick?"
01:51:12.583,01:51:16.545,I did not kill my wife.
01:51:16.545,01:51:18.005,I am not a murderer.
01:51:18.005,01:51:19.923,SHARON: But you were unfaithful.
01:51:19.923,01:51:22.259,I was unfaithful.
01:51:22.259,01:51:24.136,And I am deeply ashamed.
01:51:24.136,01:51:26.679,"SHARON: And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents..."
01:51:26.679,01:51:29.391,"her friends, all the people in your hometown..."
01:51:29.391,01:51:34.355,"believe you were a loving husband, desperate to find his missing wife."
01:51:34.355,01:51:36.273,"Well, I am desperate to find my missing wife."
01:51:36.273,01:51:37.816,"You say that, but I'm wondering..."
01:51:37.816,01:51:39.318,how you expect us to believe you...
01:51:39.318,01:51:41.320,now that we know you're a liar.
01:51:41.320,01:51:44.532,I didn't come forward with my affair...
01:51:44.532,01:51:48.536,"because I knew it would make me look really, really bad."
01:51:48.536,01:51:50.329,But I don't care about that anymore.
01:51:50.329,01:51:52.164,I just want to find my wife.
01:51:52.164,01:51:55.292,SHARON: I'm just trying to get clear-- NICK: Let me be clear.
01:51:55.292,01:51:58.962,Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy.
01:51:58.962,01:52:00.713,I'm not a good guy.
01:52:00.713,01:52:03.551,I was a bad husband to a great wife.
01:52:03.551,01:52:05.553,I broke the vow that I made to her.
01:52:05.553,01:52:08.389,"Those are pretty words, Nick."
01:52:08.389,01:52:10.140,But what does that really mean to you?
01:52:10.140,01:52:13.143,It basically means that I was a con artist.
01:52:13.143,01:52:16.438,I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.
01:52:16.438,01:52:18.482,I was completely transfixed.
01:52:18.482,01:52:20.442,Amy can do that to you.
01:52:20.442,01:52:22.944,I was this average guy from an average place...
01:52:22.944,01:52:24.988,with mediocre aspirations.
01:52:24.988,01:52:27.658,And I met a woman who dazzled me.
01:52:27.658,01:52:29.660,And I wanted her to love me...
01:52:29.660,01:52:32.913,so I pretended to be better than I was.
01:52:32.913,01:52:36.584,"When we got married, I promised to be that guy."
01:52:36.584,01:52:38.419,That guy who works harder.
01:52:38.419,01:52:40.713,"That guy who, who lives and acts..."
01:52:40.713,01:52:43.924,and loves with as much passion as she does.
01:52:43.924,01:52:46.051,But I failed her.
01:52:46.051,01:52:48.345,Instead of doing what was right...
01:52:48.345,01:52:50.805,I did what was easy.
01:52:50.805,01:52:54.101,You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife.
01:52:54.101,01:52:55.686,Who believes his wife is still alive.
01:52:55.686,01:52:56.853,She is still alive.
01:52:59.147,01:53:02.150,Will you look at that camera for me?
01:53:02.150,01:53:05.153,Will you look in the lens...
01:53:05.153,01:53:07.406,and talk to your wife?
01:53:07.406,01:53:10.325,"If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight..."
01:53:10.325,01:53:12.745,"what would you like to say to her, Nick?"
01:53:16.624,01:53:19.585,"Amy, I love you."
01:53:19.585,01:53:22.421,You're the best person I've ever known.
01:53:22.421,01:53:24.715,And I've taken myself to the woodshed...
01:53:24.715,01:53:27.008,for the way that I've treated you.
01:53:27.008,01:53:28.969,"And if you come back, I promise..."
01:53:28.969,01:53:32.013,I will spend every day making it up to you.
01:53:32.013,01:53:35.643,I will be the man that I promised you I would be.
01:53:38.270,01:53:39.563,I love you.
01:53:40.188,01:53:41.732,Come home.
01:53:46.361,01:53:47.446,Here.
01:53:53.744,01:53:55.329,SHARON: Regardless of what you thought...
01:53:55.329,01:53:57.623,NICK: What does it say?
01:53:57.623,01:53:59.082,...I think we can all agree...
01:53:59.082,01:54:00.751,"Oh, my God."
01:54:00.751,01:54:01.876,...there's more to him than meets the eye.
01:54:01.876,01:54:03.587,They're going crazy for you.
01:54:03.587,01:54:07.675,"They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me."
01:54:07.675,01:54:09.301,And now they love me.
01:54:09.301,01:54:12.262,...a candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect.
01:54:12.262,01:54:13.972,He's certainly earned mine.
01:54:14.931,01:54:16.433,What is it?
01:54:18.811,01:54:22.105,I'm Sharon Schieber.
01:54:27.194,01:54:29.738,"Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant for your property."
01:54:29.738,01:54:32.073,I usually ignore tipline calls...
01:54:32.073,01:54:33.992,but a neighbor was concerned about...
01:54:33.992,01:54:36.995,a strange man around your woodshed.
01:54:36.995,01:54:38.079,Call Tanner.
01:54:38.079,01:54:39.581,Okay. Fuck!
01:54:43.418,01:54:44.837,"Girlfriend's real cute, Nick."
01:54:46.046,01:54:47.548,Is that what this is about?
01:54:48.716,01:54:50.759,I have treated you more than fair...
01:54:50.759,01:54:53.679,throughout this entire investigation.
01:54:53.679,01:54:55.806,I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over.
01:54:55.806,01:54:57.224,Every time you said something stupid...
01:54:57.224,01:54:59.768,"I thought, Maybe he's just stupid."
01:54:59.768,01:55:02.354,But I was wrong.
01:55:02.354,01:55:03.564,Are these the clubs you don't play golf with?
01:55:03.564,01:55:04.898,None of that is mine.
01:55:04.898,01:55:06.941,None of this was put here by me.
01:55:06.941,01:55:10.153,Those are nice clubs.
01:55:10.153,01:55:13.114,Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good.
01:55:13.114,01:55:14.324,GO: Nick!
01:55:15.534,01:55:16.869,"Hey, you can't do that!"
01:55:16.869,01:55:18.286,Of course we can.
01:55:26.587,01:55:29.381,"Amy, it's time to move on."
01:55:29.381,01:55:31.633,What can I do to help?
01:55:31.633,01:55:33.343,I need some time to think.
01:55:33.343,01:55:35.053,That's the last thing you need.
01:55:35.053,01:55:38.766,"Desi-- Twenty years, you have kept me dangling."
01:55:38.766,01:55:42.770,"Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me."
01:55:42.770,01:55:45.021,Follow that instinct.
01:55:45.021,01:55:47.190,Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten and homeless...
01:55:47.190,01:55:50.235,"sleeping in your car, fearing for your life."
01:55:53.822,01:55:56.283,I'm not gonna force myself on you.
01:55:58.993,01:56:01.496,"I understand what you're saying, Desi."
01:56:02.706,01:56:04.332,I do.
01:56:07.920,01:56:09.755,I've been so mistreated for so long.
01:56:12.507,01:56:15.176,I've forgotten how to behave.
01:56:20.974,01:56:23.435,I'll move in here tomorrow...
01:56:23.435,01:56:25.729,and we'll work it out together.
01:56:28.273,01:56:31.735,I just want you to be you again.
01:56:39.785,01:56:41.578,TANNER: They only took Margo to fuck with you.
01:56:41.578,01:56:43.246,She's not spending another fucking second in there.
01:56:43.246,01:56:45.582,"I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything."
01:56:46.082,01:56:47.835,What?
01:56:50.003,01:56:51.839,We tell Boney very little.
01:56:51.839,01:56:54.048,"Without a body, without a murder weapon..."
01:56:54.048,01:56:56.217,their only hope is a confession.
01:56:56.217,01:56:58.470,"So, you let them do all the talking."
01:56:58.470,01:57:00.430,"That way, we can jump-start your defense."
01:57:00.430,01:57:02.850,The truth is my defense.
01:57:08.605,01:57:10.398,Recognize these?
01:57:10.398,01:57:12.108,Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me.
01:57:12.108,01:57:13.944,"Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick?"
01:57:13.944,01:57:16.655,"Mommy, Daddy, baby, and that made you real mad?"
01:57:16.655,01:57:19.449,No.
01:57:19.449,01:57:21.869,Recognize this?
01:57:21.869,01:57:24.746,It's Amy's diary.
01:57:26.665,01:57:28.124,Is this your wife's handwriting?
01:57:28.124,01:57:30.168,He's not a handwriting ex-- Looks like it.
01:57:30.168,01:57:31.670,"Our experts thought so, too."
01:57:32.713,01:57:34.214,Do you wanna play a little true or false?
01:57:35.048,01:57:36.842,Sure.
01:57:36.842,01:57:40.804,And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me.
01:57:41.847,01:57:43.682,"Yeah, that's true."
01:57:45.183,01:57:47.227,You thought quinoa was a fish?
01:57:48.520,01:57:49.771,"That is also true, yes."
01:57:51.899,01:57:54.108,"She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her."
01:57:54.108,01:57:56.152,I hit her?
01:57:56.152,01:57:58.154,"Pushed, it says pushed."
01:57:58.154,01:57:59.656,I never touched her.
01:58:01.449,01:58:03.785,She tried to buy a gun.
01:58:03.785,01:58:05.495,"I doubt that, but I don't know."
01:58:06.914,01:58:08.498,Shall I read the last entry?
01:58:08.498,01:58:09.666,Sure.
01:58:10.918,01:58:13.127,This man may kill me.
01:58:13.127,01:58:15.463,"In her own words, This man may kill me."
01:58:15.463,01:58:17.465,It's kind of a convenient end note.
01:58:23.972,01:58:25.557,TANNER: For future reference...
01:58:25.557,01:58:27.809,"the truth, you are not a handwriting expert."
01:58:27.809,01:58:29.310,"Okay, I know."
01:58:37.318,01:58:38.946,BONEY: Judy's missing handle.
01:58:40.781,01:58:43.199,"Big as a two-by-four, right?"
01:58:43.199,01:58:45.953,"We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office."
01:58:45.953,01:58:48.371,"We didn't know what the hell it was, but fire in July?"
01:58:48.371,01:58:49.623,We bagged it.
01:58:49.623,01:58:51.875,I've never seen that before either.
01:58:51.875,01:58:53.251,BONEY: We just tested it.
01:58:53.251,01:58:55.545,"So, finally, Nicholas Dunne..."
01:58:55.545,01:58:57.130,you're under arrest for the murder of your wife.
01:58:57.130,01:58:58.465,Do not say another word.
01:58:58.465,01:58:59.716,What about my side?
01:59:13.105,01:59:14.481,More coffee?
01:59:14.481,01:59:16.274,I'd love it.
01:59:18.819,01:59:22.405,Remember that time we skipped school and drove to the Cape?
01:59:22.405,01:59:24.908,"Oh, God, yeah."
01:59:24.908,01:59:27.035,This reminds me of that.
01:59:27.035,01:59:28.745,Never-ending holiday.
01:59:30.330,01:59:32.624,You're not bored?
01:59:32.624,01:59:34.292,"Desi, how could I be bored?"
01:59:34.292,01:59:36.670,You can discuss 18th-century symphonies...
01:59:36.670,01:59:40.048,"19th-century Impressionists, quote Proust in French."
01:59:40.048,01:59:44.011,Nick's idea of culture was a reality TV marathon...
01:59:44.011,01:59:45.971,with one hand down his boxers.
01:59:47.889,01:59:50.017,I really have to get going.
01:59:50.017,01:59:53.020,But I will be back just as soon as I can.
01:59:59.609,02:00:00.819,My keys.
02:00:06.116,02:00:07.951,Thank you.
02:00:13.832,02:00:15.333,Ow!
02:00:19.379,02:00:20.714,That's how the kids wear it.
02:01:21.816,02:01:25.445,Dunne?
02:01:28.198,02:01:29.908,Hey.
02:01:29.908,02:01:31.034,Are you okay?
02:01:31.034,02:01:32.160,Yes. Are you?
02:01:32.160,02:01:33.536,Yeah.
02:01:33.536,02:01:35.455,Let's go.
02:01:37.415,02:01:38.499,What does this mean?
02:01:38.499,02:01:41.002,"Well, you're out on bond."
02:01:41.002,02:01:43.838,You can relax at home while we prep for trial.
02:01:49.385,02:01:51.429,Keep your head down.
02:02:07.195,02:02:09.447,"Tanner, is there any fucking lead on Amy?"
02:02:09.447,02:02:11.825,I've got two of my best guys on it.
02:02:11.825,02:02:13.451,She's air.
02:02:15.703,02:02:18.456,"Come home, Amy."
02:03:15.596,02:03:18.350,Mr. Collings is home.
02:03:18.350,02:03:20.601,"Hello, Mr. Collings."
02:03:20.601,02:03:22.520,I've missed you.
02:03:22.520,02:03:24.856,I've been thinking...
02:03:24.856,02:03:26.900,I don't wanna be without you.
02:03:27.441,02:03:30.111,Stay with me.
02:03:30.111,02:03:32.864,"And when all this dies down, we'll go to Greece, like you said."
02:03:32.864,02:03:35.033,Octopus and Scrabble?
02:03:37.202,02:03:39.579,How long do you think until it's done?
02:03:39.579,02:03:43.457,Not long.
02:03:43.457,02:03:44.834,He'll appeal.
02:03:44.834,02:03:46.836,I can watch the rest overseas.
02:04:04.354,02:04:05.521,Go slowly.
02:04:05.521,02:04:06.606,But I want it.
02:04:28.711,02:04:30.671,Just do it.
02:04:39.055,02:04:40.598,Harder.
02:06:19.197,02:06:22.409,You fucking bitch.
02:06:31.125,02:06:36.756,"DOCTOR: Don't you worry, you're gonna have lots of babies."
02:06:36.756,02:06:40.176,Her wounds are consistent with rape.
02:06:40.176,02:06:41.553,We'll make sure it's a match.
02:06:41.553,02:06:42.887,"Yeah, it'll match."
02:06:42.887,02:06:45.265,Thank you very much.
02:06:45.265,02:06:46.891,What do you think?
02:06:46.891,02:06:48.393,Are we pals again?
02:06:48.393,02:06:51.604,"Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes."
02:06:51.604,02:06:53.064,What do you think?
02:06:53.064,02:06:55.816,Kidnapping?
02:06:58.194,02:07:00.530,She's on fairly heavy painkillers.
02:07:00.530,02:07:02.698,It's okay.
02:07:02.698,02:07:03.991,"FBI AGENT: Ms. Dunne, I know what you've been through..."
02:07:03.991,02:07:06.327,so we'll keep this very brief.
02:07:06.327,02:07:08.662,Can you walk us through what happened?
02:07:11.332,02:07:13.709,"That morning, the doorbell rang."
02:07:14.710,02:07:16.754,So normal.
02:07:16.754,02:07:18.672,I opened the door.
02:07:19.299,02:07:22.093,So strange.
02:07:22.093,02:07:25.679,"Since high school, he won't ever go away."
02:07:25.679,02:07:28.600,And I've just tried to be nice to him.
02:07:28.600,02:07:30.435,Answer his letters.
02:07:30.435,02:07:32.520,Keep him calm.
02:07:33.938,02:07:36.065,"Oh, my God."
02:07:36.065,02:07:37.609,"Oh, I've encouraged him."
02:07:37.609,02:07:39.444,You can't blame yourself.
02:07:41.112,02:07:43.156,He pushed inside.
02:07:44.824,02:07:47.743,And he grabbed me.
02:07:47.743,02:07:51.038,"But I got away, and ran to the kitchen."
02:07:51.038,02:07:52.706,And he clubbed me.
02:07:53.207,02:07:54.792,I collapsed.
02:07:54.792,02:07:58.588,That club was actually the handle to a Punch and Judy puppet.
02:07:58.588,02:08:00.047,Right.
02:08:01.090,02:08:02.467,Treasure hunt.
02:08:04.511,02:08:08.097,I'd hidden some puppets at Go's-- Then how did Desi have that handle?
02:08:10.099,02:08:11.851,I'd just found it.
02:08:12.685,02:08:15.146,It must have fallen off.
02:08:15.146,02:08:17.357,I...
02:08:17.357,02:08:20.734,was holding it when Desi pushed in.
02:08:20.734,02:08:22.069,About that woodshed...
02:08:22.069,02:08:24.364,He took me to his lake house.
02:08:24.364,02:08:26.157,Tied me to his bed.
02:08:26.157,02:08:28.701,Back to the woodshed real quick. Real quick.
02:08:28.701,02:08:30.578,When you went to place the puppets there...
02:08:30.578,02:08:33.289,did you notice that it was packed-- Lots of stuff.
02:08:33.289,02:08:35.708,Corresponding to purchases made...
02:08:35.708,02:08:37.669,on credit cards in your husband's name.
02:08:37.669,02:08:39.337,AMY: Nick and credit cards.
02:08:39.337,02:08:41.839,"He buys, I nag."
02:08:41.839,02:08:45.259,He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
02:08:45.259,02:08:49.514,"Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner..."
02:08:49.514,02:08:52.266,by a man with a history of mental problems?
02:08:52.266,02:08:53.767,"Please continue, Ms. Dunne."
02:08:57.730,02:08:59.649,Desi assaulted me that night.
02:09:00.567,02:09:02.443,Every night.
02:09:03.528,02:09:05.905,He tied me up like a dog.
02:09:07.532,02:09:09.742,"And then, he'd punish me."
02:09:11.785,02:09:13.663,Starve me.
02:09:15.289,02:09:16.999,Shave me.
02:09:18.626,02:09:21.546,Sodomize me.
02:09:21.546,02:09:23.423,There were cameras everywhere.
02:09:23.423,02:09:26.175,Please find this.
02:09:28.094,02:09:32.265,She slit his throat with a box cutter.
02:09:32.265,02:09:34.684,How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter...
02:09:34.684,02:09:38.312,if he had her tied up the whole time?
02:09:38.312,02:09:40.856,Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe?
02:09:40.856,02:09:43.109,"Amy, we found your diary."
02:09:43.109,02:09:46.987,It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse.
02:09:46.987,02:09:49.657,"Well, it's the ugly truth."
02:09:50.617,02:09:52.076,Nick didn't want a baby.
02:09:54.036,02:09:57.206,He has a temper.
02:09:58.291,02:09:59.542,But I love him.
02:09:59.542,02:10:01.043,Then why did you try to buy a gun?
02:10:03.170,02:10:05.298,"I'm sorry, I feel myself fading."
02:10:05.298,02:10:10.511,If I could just clarify one thing-- If this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands...
02:10:10.511,02:10:12.722,my husband would be on death row...
02:10:12.722,02:10:16.768,"and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle..."
02:10:16.768,02:10:20.187,"Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave."
02:10:21.188,02:10:23.441,"Now, I have to ask you..."
02:10:23.441,02:10:26.068,do you feel safe going home with your husband?
02:10:38.706,02:10:41.292,"We prayed to God, and God has answered our prayers."
02:10:41.292,02:10:43.210,Amy Dunne is home.
02:10:43.210,02:10:45.045,"Now, I know there are a lot of questions and concerns..."
02:10:45.045,02:10:46.839,"but for right now, we wanna sit tight..."
02:10:46.839,02:10:48.841,and just be thankful and grateful...
02:10:48.841,02:10:51.844,for this miracle on the Mississippi.
02:10:59.352,02:11:00.978,Excuse me.
02:11:52.739,02:11:53.823,"WOMAN: We love you, Amy!"
02:11:58.786,02:12:00.454,"All right, you can stop pretending now."
02:12:00.454,02:12:02.122,I'm not pretending.
02:12:02.874,02:12:05.585,You were perfect.
02:12:05.585,02:12:07.795,"The Nick I saw on TV, that's the Nick I fell in love with."
02:12:07.795,02:12:09.129,You do know I was just telling you...
02:12:09.129,02:12:10.715,"what you wanted to hear, right?"
02:12:10.715,02:12:12.550,That's how well you know me.
02:12:12.550,02:12:14.927,You know me in your marrow.
02:12:16.053,02:12:17.930,Okay.
02:12:17.930,02:12:20.933,You need to tell me exactly what happened.
02:12:22.476,02:12:24.144,Take off your clothes.
02:12:24.144,02:12:27.231,I need to make sure you're not wearing a wire.
02:12:40.453,02:12:44.665,"You killed someone, Amy."
02:12:44.665,02:12:46.333,I'm a fighter.
02:12:46.333,02:12:48.753,I fought my way back to you.
02:12:48.753,02:12:50.755,You killed a guy.
02:12:50.755,02:12:52.840,You slashed his throat with a box cutter.
02:12:52.840,02:12:55.426,You went on national television...
02:12:55.426,02:12:57.261,and begged for me to save your life.
02:12:57.929,02:12:59.305,And I obliged.
02:12:59.305,02:13:01.098,But I want that Nick.
02:13:01.098,02:13:02.683,I'm leaving.
02:13:02.683,02:13:05.060,You really think that's smart?
02:13:05.728,02:13:06.854,Shampoo.
02:13:09.690,02:13:13.402,"Wounded, raped wife battles her way back to her husband..."
02:13:13.402,02:13:15.279,and he deserts her.
02:13:15.279,02:13:16.447,They'll destroy you.
02:13:17.281,02:13:19.074,Neighbors will shun you.
02:13:19.074,02:13:22.787,And I'll make sure that no one forgets the pain you caused me.
02:13:25.289,02:13:30.586,I don't want anything to do with your groupies outside.
02:13:30.586,02:13:32.212,Once they go...
02:13:32.964,02:13:34.256,I go.
02:13:34.256,02:13:37.510,Give it the night.
02:13:54.443,02:13:56.320,Was there ever a baby?
02:13:56.320,02:13:58.238,There can be.
02:14:02.242,02:14:03.327,Good night.
02:14:56.171,02:14:57.840,"MAN: Hey, Nick!"
02:15:10.227,02:15:11.395,"Hello, handsome."
02:15:14.481,02:15:16.233,Crepe?
02:15:16.859,02:15:17.985,Sure.
02:15:17.985,02:15:20.279,She was his dream girl.
02:15:20.279,02:15:23.240,"And when this spoiled, rich, entitled little boy couldn't have her..."
02:15:23.240,02:15:24.575,he took her.
02:15:31.958,02:15:33.166,You must be so proud.
02:15:40.340,02:15:42.969,It's been four hours.
02:15:42.969,02:15:45.846,Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?
02:15:49.976,02:15:53.813,"Right now, it's all about our marriage."
02:15:53.813,02:15:57.274,When two people love each other and can't make that work...
02:15:57.274,02:15:59.610,that's the real tragedy.
02:16:03.572,02:16:05.449,Kiss my cheek.
02:16:12.039,02:16:14.792,I can't believe that fucking spider is America's sweetheart.
02:16:14.792,02:16:17.169,She told me she killed Desi.
02:16:17.169,02:16:18.504,Not self-defense.
02:16:18.504,02:16:19.839,GO: Can't we get a wire?
02:16:19.839,02:16:21.632,She told you once before.
02:16:21.632,02:16:23.592,"Yeah, because she had me strip naked, and stand in the shower."
02:16:23.592,02:16:26.679,"I swear, you two are the most fucked-up people I've ever known."
02:16:26.679,02:16:28.514,And I specialize in fucked-up.
02:16:28.514,02:16:30.432,You and Amy under the same roof?
02:16:30.432,02:16:33.185,You should pitch that as reality television.
02:16:33.185,02:16:35.479,"Amy Dunne, and the Miracle on the Mississippi."
02:16:35.479,02:16:37.648,AMY: Nick and I have been through some bad patches.
02:16:37.648,02:16:39.066,We've had our dark days.
02:16:39.066,02:16:41.735,But we thank you so much...
02:16:41.735,02:16:46.490,"for supporting us in our new life together, for forgiving Nick."
02:16:46.490,02:16:49.952,"Really, your encouragement means the world."
02:16:49.952,02:16:51.495,"Oh, she's good."
02:16:51.495,02:16:54.040,Amazing Amy and the Humbled Husband.
02:16:54.040,02:16:56.208,The Real Housewives of Branson.
02:16:56.208,02:16:57.710,"Take care of this guy, will you?"
02:16:57.710,02:16:58.878,I can't believe you're just leaving now.
02:16:58.878,02:17:00.629,You are not at risk anymore.
02:17:00.629,02:17:02.381,I'm the definition of at risk.
02:17:02.381,02:17:06.343,"You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie, you franchised The Bar."
02:17:06.343,02:17:07.845,You may wanna thank her.
02:17:10.472,02:17:11.765,Just don't piss her off.
02:17:12.265,02:17:13.350,"See you, guys."
02:17:15.728,02:17:17.563,Elvis has left Missouri.
02:17:17.563,02:17:18.981,She had to have made a mistake.
02:17:18.981,02:17:20.941,"We need to check Amy's story, piece by piece."
02:17:20.941,02:17:23.318,"Nick, I can't do anything."
02:17:23.318,02:17:26.155,"We had the national spotlight on us, we stained the rug."
02:17:26.155,02:17:28.115,"The case is with the Feds now, they're done."
02:17:28.115,02:17:29.158,That doesn't mean you have to be done.
02:17:29.158,02:17:30.868,It does.
02:18:02.858,02:18:04.026,What are you doing?
02:18:06.112,02:18:07.613,Couldn't sleep.
02:18:07.613,02:18:08.989,Come on...
02:18:08.989,02:18:11.033,let me tuck you back in.
02:18:24.004,02:18:26.381,"You know you can sleep with me, right?"
02:18:28.341,02:18:30.510,"Yeah, it's just..."
02:18:30.510,02:18:32.179,I need more time.
02:18:32.179,02:18:35.724,"I would never, ever hurt you."
02:18:37.726,02:18:40.020,"I do need you to participate, though."
02:18:40.020,02:18:42.064,I need you to do your part.
02:18:52.616,02:18:53.742,Okay.
02:18:53.742,02:18:57.079,Everything you have heard about my wife...
02:18:57.079,02:18:58.580,is a lie.
02:18:58.580,02:19:03.335,"She is a calculating, murderous psychopath."
02:19:03.335,02:19:06.172,And I have been complicit-- AMY: Nick!
02:19:11.510,02:19:13.679,Nick? Breakfast.
02:19:13.679,02:19:14.763,Honey?
02:19:18.517,02:19:21.145,We should hold hands.
02:19:21.145,02:19:25.482,"Not the entire time, but on and off throughout."
02:19:25.482,02:19:27.609,"So, Nick, how does it feel to have your wife back?"
02:19:30.279,02:19:32.198,It's fantastic.
02:19:32.198,02:19:33.740,How many people are lucky enough...
02:19:33.740,02:19:35.367,to get a second chance at love?
02:19:35.367,02:19:37.286,Fantastic is a little flippant.
02:19:37.286,02:19:38.954,Amazing?
02:19:38.954,02:19:41.832,I need you to admit that you got the credit cards...
02:19:41.832,02:19:45.294,and that you hid all that stuff at Go's and that you pushed me.
02:19:45.294,02:19:47.379,I'm gonna need those three things to feel safe.
02:19:49.589,02:19:51.217,"You have to own this, Nick."
02:19:52.134,02:19:53.760,Don't worry.
02:19:53.760,02:19:55.679,I know exactly what to say.
02:19:57.223,02:19:58.724,Nick.
02:20:01.852,02:20:04.479,What a beautiful home.
02:20:06.065,02:20:08.608,"I so appreciate you giving us this time, Nick."
02:20:08.608,02:20:10.861,You went on national television...
02:20:10.861,02:20:13.239,and told people that I murdered my wife.
02:20:13.239,02:20:15.366,I go where the story goes.
02:20:15.366,02:20:17.784,You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister.
02:20:17.784,02:20:21.496,I didn't use the I word.
02:20:21.496,02:20:25.751,You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath.
02:20:26.960,02:20:28.754,Ice-breaker.
02:20:32.507,02:20:34.301,To go with your robot dog.
02:20:34.301,02:20:36.178,I'll go find Amy.
02:20:38.389,02:20:40.307,She's downstairs.
02:20:42.893,02:20:44.436,What is it?
02:20:44.436,02:20:46.313,Open it.
02:20:46.313,02:20:48.107,I don't need any more gifts from you.
02:20:48.107,02:20:49.816,Open it.
02:21:02.495,02:21:04.123,I didn't touch you.
02:21:04.123,02:21:05.249,You didn't need to.
02:21:05.249,02:21:08.585,Bullshit.
02:21:08.585,02:21:10.003,I have that.
02:21:10.003,02:21:12.131,"The notice, yes."
02:21:12.131,02:21:13.548,I want a blood test.
02:21:13.548,02:21:14.716,I want a paternity test.
02:21:15.384,02:21:17.094,I love tests.
02:21:17.094,02:21:18.720,You can teach those people to hate me all you want.
02:21:18.720,02:21:21.348,I don't care.
02:21:23.725,02:21:26.395,I won't have to teach your child to hate you.
02:21:26.395,02:21:28.688,He'll do that all by himself.
02:21:28.688,02:21:30.649,You fucking cunt!
02:21:32.609,02:21:35.070,I'm the cunt you married.
02:21:35.070,02:21:36.905,The only time you liked yourself...
02:21:36.905,02:21:40.533,was when you were trying to be someone this cunt might like.
02:21:40.533,02:21:43.662,I'm not a quitter.
02:21:47.791,02:21:52.421,I've killed for you.
02:21:52.421,02:21:54.631,You think you would be happy with a nice Midwestern girl?
02:21:54.631,02:21:57.759,"No way, baby. I'm it."
02:21:57.759,02:22:01.096,"Look, you're delusional."
02:22:01.096,02:22:02.973,Why would you even want this?
02:22:02.973,02:22:04.975,"Yes, I loved you."
02:22:04.975,02:22:07.478,"And then all we did was resent each other, and try to control each other."
02:22:07.478,02:22:09.146,And cause each other pain.
02:22:09.146,02:22:10.730,That's marriage.
02:22:13.525,02:22:15.861,"Now, I'm getting ready."
02:22:41.636,02:22:44.473,GO: I can't watch you play house with that thing for the next 18 years.
02:22:44.473,02:22:46.099,I can't just walk away.
02:22:46.099,02:22:47.642,You could get custody.
02:22:47.642,02:22:51.813,"No, I won't."
02:22:51.813,02:22:54.691,It's gonna be my child.
02:22:54.691,02:22:56.776,You wanna stay.
02:22:56.776,02:23:00.697,I have a responsibility.
02:23:00.697,02:23:02.782,You wanna stay with her.
02:23:12.625,02:23:14.002,You're breaking my heart.
02:23:14.002,02:23:17.589,"Go, you're my voice of reason."
02:23:17.589,02:23:20.300,I need you with me on this.
02:23:20.300,02:23:22.677,Of course I'm with you.
02:23:25.389,02:23:29.226,I was with you before we were even born.
02:23:31.144,02:23:34.565,NICK: We've been through the darkness.
02:23:34.565,02:23:37.650,"We've come out, united."
02:23:40.653,02:23:42.739,We communicate.
02:23:45.242,02:23:47.619,We're honest with each other.
02:23:47.619,02:23:49.121,Right?
02:23:51.164,02:23:53.625,We're partners in crime.
02:23:56.795,02:23:57.879,And?
02:23:59.881,02:24:01.258,And?
02:24:04.511,02:24:06.472,We're gonna be parents.
02:24:07.139,02:24:10.350,"Oh, my goodness!"
02:24:10.350,02:24:12.102,"Oh, how exciting!"
02:24:17.065,02:24:19.318,NICK: What are you thinking?
02:24:22.404,02:24:24.490,How are you feeling?
02:24:26.575,02:24:28.952,What have we done to each other?
02:24:30.662,02:24:32.498,What will we do?.
