00:00:20.270,00:00:21.896,"Congratulations, General Naird."
00:00:28.028,00:00:30.864,It has always been my dream to command a service branch.
00:00:31.865,00:00:38.997,"I have been shot down, both literally and figuratively, but I have always gotten back up."
00:00:40.665,00:00:41.750,All right.
00:00:41.833,00:00:50.884,"My old CO used to say that the greatest asset in an F-35, and that is a $100 million plane, is its pilot."
00:00:51.301,00:00:53.553,When I was-- All right. I'll skip ahead.
00:00:53.636,00:00:55.472,There's much more that I could say.
00:00:58.058,00:00:59.392,I only wish that...
00:01:00.602,00:01:03.646,my parents could have been here to see this.
00:01:05.190,00:01:07.901,But they were unable to get flights from New Jersey in time.
00:01:09.944,00:01:13.573,"Maggie, Erin, this is a Naird family team win."
00:01:14.783,00:01:15.742,Woo-woo.
00:01:18.870,00:01:20.413,-So proud of you. -Thanks.
00:01:21.164,00:01:22.248,I don't get it.
00:01:22.582,00:01:26.461,"Dad, when you made three-star, we had 100 guests and a band."
00:01:26.544,00:01:28.088,"It's a different administration, bug."
00:01:28.171,00:01:30.298,This one's... a little more chaotic.
00:01:31.341,00:01:35.178,The Air Force chief's house in Arlington is gorgeous and comes with a staff.
00:01:35.261,00:01:36.096,Thank you.
00:01:36.179,00:01:38.181,"Dad, I am so proud of you."
00:01:38.598,00:01:39.891,-Thanks. -General.
00:01:40.934,00:01:43.478,Joint Chiefs in five minutes. Come on.
00:01:45.563,00:01:46.564,Kick.
00:01:46.648,00:01:49.192,"Get lost, Naird. This is for four-stars."
00:01:49.275,00:01:50.235,Like me.
00:01:51.236,00:01:53.279,They didn't tell you? Or did you forget?
00:01:53.363,00:01:56.574,Like you forgot to get competitive bidding for the AT-6B.
00:01:56.658,00:01:58.493,Tell me what? That you wear a dress?
00:01:59.452,00:02:00.829,I knew that already.
00:02:01.621,00:02:03.081,Gender roles.
00:02:03.164,00:02:05.959,Offensive. And out of date. Just like you.
00:02:06.417,00:02:08.086,But I don't have to listen to it anymore.
00:02:08.795,00:02:10.672,"Good luck with your retirement, Kick."
00:02:10.755,00:02:15.468,"And I say that facetiously, because you're a crook and a womanizer, and I hate your guts."
00:02:16.094,00:02:17.220,"God, that felt good."
00:02:19.222,00:02:21.015,"Welcome, gentlemen, thank you for joining us."
00:02:21.099,00:02:22.475,POTUS wants to make some changes.
00:02:22.559,00:02:26.146,"He's tweeting about it in five minutes, so let's hope you like it."
00:02:26.688,00:02:32.443,"I wanna welcome our newest four-star general, Mark Naird, formerly number two at the Air Force."
00:02:32.902,00:02:35.738,"He's done an amazing job, has a most distinguished career."
00:02:38.700,00:02:41.077,Why is Kick still in the room? I don't-- Hmm.
00:02:41.161,00:02:46.457,"Our nation's internet, including Twitter, runs through our vulnerable space satellites."
00:02:46.541,00:02:49.335,POTUS wants complete space dominance.
00:02:49.419,00:02:51.629,Boots on the moon by 2024.
00:02:52.380,00:02:55.341,"To that end, the president is creating a new branch."
00:02:55.842,00:02:56.718,Space Force.
00:02:57.802,00:02:58.803,Which Mark will run.
00:03:00.346,00:03:03.308,"In close cooperation with Air Force, which Kick will still head."
00:03:03.391,00:03:04.642,"Oh, you've gotta be kidding me."
00:03:06.394,00:03:08.271,Boots on the moon in 2024.
00:03:09.022,00:03:13.276,"Actually, he said, Boobs on the moon, but we believe that to be a typo."
00:03:13.359,00:03:15.820,This is bullshit. Space is part of the air.
00:03:16.321,00:03:17.822,Naird works for me.
00:03:17.906,00:03:21.492,"Uh, hang on. Hang on. I don't think there's air in space."
00:03:21.576,00:03:24.454,"There certainly isn't any damn water, Admiral, so you don't get an opinion."
00:03:24.537,00:03:27.207,"Air Force used to just be part of the Army, Kick."
00:03:27.290,00:03:29.000,I'd like to stuff you both back in.
00:03:29.083,00:03:31.211,"If there's no air or water, two questions."
00:03:31.294,00:03:35.006,"What is it exactly, and why can't they hear you scream?"
00:03:35.882,00:03:39.010,"Well, at least Coast Guard isn't last in line anymore."
00:03:39.302,00:03:41.387,"-Oh, you're still last. -Oh, definitely last."
00:03:41.471,00:03:43.640,"You're behind Salvation Army, Louis."
00:04:09.499,00:04:11.542,"So, how are you handling this?"
00:04:11.626,00:04:15.171,"I know you wanted the Air Force, and you're not the most flexible person."
00:04:21.678,00:04:26.015,I'll admit I was a little disappointed at first.
00:04:26.474,00:04:29.894,But then I saw this painting. John Paul Jones.
00:04:30.228,00:04:31.604,And it made me think.
00:04:32.397,00:04:35.900,"The founder of the Space Force, that's going to be me."
00:04:36.276,00:04:40.405,This is such a great opportunity to start something from the ground up.
00:04:40.780,00:04:42.615,We're gonna build a huge new base.
00:04:42.699,00:04:43.658,Mmm.
00:04:44.284,00:04:48.621,"Well, DC real estate, the way it is, you'll be lucky if it's this side of Dulles Airport."
00:04:48.705,00:04:52.000,"Oh, well, it's definitely gonna be on the other side of Dulles."
00:04:52.083,00:04:53.876,"By about 2,000 miles."
00:04:53.960,00:04:55.920,-We're going to Colorado. -What?
00:04:56.004,00:04:59.882,There's this old NORAD facility that's got a lot of potential.
00:04:59.966,00:05:01.801,And Colorado? Oh!
00:05:02.760,00:05:04.137,Up and coming.
00:05:04.220,00:05:06.514,Did you know Amazon put their new headquarters there?
00:05:06.597,00:05:07.890,Really?
00:05:08.182,00:05:10.601,No. But they seriously considered it.
00:05:11.269,00:05:13.021,You and Erin are gonna love it there.
00:05:17.817,00:05:20.111,And next year at this time...
00:05:21.195,00:05:23.114,we might have boots on the moon.
00:05:38.880,00:05:40.131,"Big launch today, huh?"
00:05:41.591,00:05:42.508,Launch?
00:05:42.925,00:05:44.052,At the new base.
00:05:45.261,00:05:46.137,What base?
00:05:46.554,00:05:48.222,"Oh, right. It's a secret."
00:07:20.940,00:07:23.192,There's a guy in the trunk. Hold him till after the launch.
00:07:23.276,00:07:24.235,"Yes, sir."
00:07:26.028,00:07:27.321,"What the fuck, man?"
00:07:50.970,00:07:55.224,"So then you say do bat your eye-- -Big launch today, sir. -Yes."
00:07:55.308,00:07:57.477,The congressional delegation will be arriving for lunch.
00:07:57.560,00:08:01.772,You have to speak for ten minutes Don't worry. We have a new helo pilot.
00:08:01.856,00:08:03.316,We'll get you in and out of there in no time.
00:08:03.733,00:08:07.820,And the launch at 1700 is set to be a live feed on the East Coast.
00:08:07.904,00:08:12.783,"You have a light day today, so you can start in the gym, and your calendar says it's a leg day."
00:08:15.411,00:08:16.412,Dr. Mallory.
00:08:18.581,00:08:20.750,Oh! Dr. Mallory is waiting for you.
00:08:20.833,00:08:22.460,"Yes, he is."
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.879,"-He said not to say anything. -Thank you, Brad."
00:08:28.841,00:08:29.759,No.
00:08:29.842,00:08:33.471,"Senator Schugler, Pitosi, and the angry young congresswoman are coming."
00:08:33.554,00:08:35.932,They need to see a success so we can keep our funding.
00:08:36.015,00:08:44.023,Oh. My idea of success would not be a six-billion-dollar piece of hardware breaking up over Denver.
00:08:44.106,00:08:45.483,That is not going to happen.
00:08:45.566,00:08:50.905,"Look, I don't like to pull rank, -but I order you to postpone the launch. -Ah..."
00:08:50.988,00:08:51.822,Okay?
00:08:51.906,00:08:54.158,There's too much moisture in the air.
00:08:54.242,00:08:56.827,We prefer a less ionized environment.
00:08:56.911,00:08:59.038,You are a civilian advisor.
00:08:59.288,00:09:01.207,There are always going to be risks.
00:09:01.290,00:09:04.126,Conditions are never perfect.
00:09:04.210,00:09:06.128,They're supposed to be perfect tomorrow.
00:09:06.212,00:09:08.297,The delegation will be back in Washington tomorrow.
00:09:08.381,00:09:11.092,"-You know, Mark, when I hired you... -I hired you."
00:09:11.175,00:09:15.763,...I felt your best quality was your ability to listen to good advice.
00:09:15.846,00:09:18.933,"If you've lost that, we may have to look elsewhere."
00:09:19.350,00:09:22.103,We. Who is this we that you keep talking about?
00:09:22.186,00:09:24.063,That is above your pay grade.
00:09:24.146,00:09:26.274,Nothing is above my pay grade at this base.
00:09:26.357,00:09:28.401,"Just postpone the launch, dear."
00:09:28.484,00:09:29.360,Nope.
00:09:36.158,00:09:37.577,"So, no launch today, I hear."
00:09:37.660,00:09:38.869,"No, launch is still on."
00:09:38.953,00:09:41.163,Oh. I'll have to tell the base biologist.
00:09:41.247,00:09:45.042,-What? -She has to collect all the endangered lizards within 600 yards of the launch site.
00:09:45.126,00:09:47.712,I canceled her because Mallory told me the launch was scrubbed.
00:09:47.795,00:09:50.464,No! Nobody gets to scrub anything but me.
00:09:50.548,00:09:51.882,"Oh. Got it, sir."
00:09:56.721,00:09:57.722,"Hello, Yuri."
00:09:59.599,00:10:00.933,"Oh. Uh, Yuri's in there."
00:10:01.017,00:10:02.893,-I know. -He told me not to say anything.
00:10:03.477,00:10:04.520,"Thank you, Brad."
00:10:07.064,00:10:08.316,What are you doing in here?
00:10:08.399,00:10:10.359,"Um, I heard the launch was scrubbed."
00:10:10.443,00:10:12.236,"That is not accurate, Yuri."
00:10:12.320,00:10:14.572,Call me Bobby. It's more reassuring.
00:10:15.031,00:10:19.118,Can I see technical specifications for the Epsilon part E-16f fuel pump?
00:10:19.702,00:10:21.495,Why would you need to see that?
00:10:21.579,00:10:25.791,"Well, as observer from ISS partner country, I just want to... observe it."
00:10:25.875,00:10:28.711,"Hmm. Well, that is weird."
00:10:29.211,00:10:33.633,Your president desires close cooperation and good relations between US and Russia.
00:10:34.383,00:10:36.427,Come on. We're not China here.
00:10:37.261,00:10:40.848,"I'm sure if the president would like me to show you something, he will let me know."
00:10:41.265,00:10:42.141,Very well.
00:10:42.642,00:10:44.268,Expect a text from the secure phone.
00:10:44.644,00:10:46.437,How do you know about the secure phone?
00:10:46.937,00:10:48.522,I don't know about the secure phone.
00:10:48.606,00:10:50.691,"-You just said secure phone. -No, I didn't."
00:10:50.775,00:10:52.568,"-Yes, you did. You said secure phone. -I didn't say that."
00:10:52.652,00:10:53.569,You just said it.
00:10:53.653,00:10:54.904,"-No, I did not. -Yes, you did."
00:10:54.987,00:10:55.821,Oh!
00:10:55.905,00:10:56.822,Breath mints.
00:10:56.906,00:10:57.782,Here they are.
00:11:22.890,00:11:24.266,Yo! Oh.
00:11:24.642,00:11:26.936,-General Naird. -We may have to scrub the Epsilon launch.
00:11:27.019,00:11:29.355,-Is Yellowjacket ready to show off? -I doubt it.
00:11:29.438,00:11:32.149,"Oh, for Christ's sake. They're a billion dollars and six months over."
00:11:32.233,00:11:33.859,You're right. We should be able to see something.
00:11:33.943,00:11:35.861,-Damn right. Let's move. -I'll make a call.
00:11:38.280,00:11:39.949,-Are you running? -No. Keep up.
00:11:40.032,00:11:41.575,Will Yellowjacket be impressive enough?
00:11:41.659,00:11:44.995,First super-pressurized ultra-fast satellite-killer killer missile?
00:11:45.079,00:11:46.330,Fucking impressive to me.
00:11:50.084,00:11:52.169,Oh. Hey. Looks good.
00:11:53.754,00:11:54.755,Very sleek.
00:11:54.839,00:11:56.590,-Like the yellow fins. -Mm-hmm.
00:11:56.841,00:11:59.635,Do we have enough of these to do a test launch later as well?
00:12:00.010,00:12:00.970,"Yes, sir."
00:12:01.679,00:12:03.180,"Okay, let's do this."
00:12:23.284,00:12:24.660,"Well, that's not ready yet."
00:12:25.411,00:12:27.204,-How much was that prototype? -Four.
00:12:27.288,00:12:28.789,-Million? -Middle schools.
00:12:29.331,00:12:30.916,Cost as much as four new middle schools.
00:12:31.000,00:12:32.001,Fuck!
00:12:32.501,00:12:34.003,-You are running! -Keep up.
00:12:35.755,00:12:37.715,So I hear we're going with Yellowjacket this afternoon?
00:12:37.798,00:12:38.632,No.
00:12:39.425,00:12:41.343,"Sorry, Sheila. Still have to grab those lizards."
00:12:42.178,00:12:43.179,Hey.
00:12:44.972,00:12:46.265,Oh. Fuck Tony's in there.
00:12:49.518,00:12:51.103,"-Good morning, my general. -Good morning."
00:12:51.187,00:12:56.484,"I have your daily tweet ready for you to review, and I think you're gonna love it. You're gonna eat it up. Go. Yum-yum."
00:12:58.360,00:12:59.195,I...
00:13:00.070,00:13:01.489,I don't get it.
00:13:01.947,00:13:02.782,Any of it?
00:13:04.033,00:13:04.909,Okay.
00:13:05.576,00:13:06.410,All right.
00:13:06.494,00:13:09.038,-You know there's a new Star Wars out? -Yes.
00:13:09.121,00:13:11.874,"And Wendy's has a new hamburger that they're serving rare, so..."
00:13:11.957,00:13:16.128,"So what I am saying is that if I had a lightsaber, I would be able to cook..."
00:13:16.921,00:13:18.047,this hamburger better.
00:13:18.130,00:13:19.965,"There you go. It took a while, but you got it."
00:13:20.049,00:13:22.843,-How is this relevant to the mission? -That is culturally relevant.
00:13:22.927,00:13:27.264,I don't see how being snarky about a fast-food hamburger is culturally anything.
00:13:27.723,00:13:30.309,Do you even understand what is at stake here?
00:13:30.392,00:13:32.269,I'm trying to put boots on the moon.
00:13:32.728,00:13:34.063,Boots on the moon.
00:13:34.146,00:13:36.148,A laser sword is a child's toy.
00:13:36.232,00:13:37.650,It's a lightsaber.
00:13:37.733,00:13:39.777,Did you hear yourself? Laser sword?
00:13:39.860,00:13:41.028,Okay. I think we're done.
00:13:41.111,00:13:43.197,-You don't understand because you're old. -Okay.
00:13:43.280,00:13:48.619,You get likes by dunking on the Twitter accounts -of sassy fast-food brands. -Sassy.
00:13:48.702,00:13:51.163,I don't even know why I'm explaining clapback theory to you.
00:13:51.247,00:13:53.415,"Every time I explain anything, it seems to just go phew."
00:13:53.499,00:13:54.834,How about this for sass?
00:13:54.917,00:13:56.502,-You're fired. -What?
00:13:56.585,00:13:58.838,Your services will no longer be needed here at Space Force.
00:13:59.255,00:14:00.840,You're firing me for writing a perfect tweet?
00:14:00.923,00:14:03.592,"Is that why you're firing me? Fine, fine, fine. You know what?"
00:14:03.676,00:14:07.096,"Enjoy your 3,000 engineer followers, because, honestly, you are hopeless."
00:14:10.933,00:14:12.142,"-Brad. -Yes, sir."
00:14:12.226,00:14:16.730,Would you make sure that Tony is detained until after the launch so he doesn't tweet anything snotty?
00:14:18.941,00:14:20.442,"-Secure the phone. -Yes, sir."
00:14:21.235,00:14:26.115,"What's going on? Are you serious? Stop-- Siri, send tweet. Send tweet!"
00:14:28.993,00:14:30.619,Where are you?
00:14:31.036,00:14:33.080,It's good for you. Come on out.
00:14:38.460,00:14:39.962,"A little low, don't you think?"
00:14:40.462,00:14:41.922,"I'm flying safely, sir."
00:14:42.590,00:14:44.091,But I can lift up if you like.
00:14:44.675,00:14:45.843,At your discretion.
00:14:54.143,00:14:56.812,"You're, uh-- You're rated for F-35s, aren't you, sir?"
00:14:58.397,00:15:03.694,"Yes, I believe I've flown every F series from the Tomcat to the F-117 Nighthawk."
00:15:03.777,00:15:04.945,"That's dope, sir."
00:15:07.990,00:15:08.991,What's your name?
00:15:09.074,00:15:10.534,"Captain Angela Ali, sir."
00:15:10.618,00:15:11.660,ROTC?
00:15:11.744,00:15:13.537,"OCS. Uh, I'm actually a prior."
00:15:13.621,00:15:15.539,"I transferred as a First Class, sir."
00:15:15.623,00:15:17.041,Air Force or Space Force?
00:15:17.499,00:15:18.542,"Space Force, sir."
00:15:18.834,00:15:20.586,You don't like to use your full title?
00:15:21.211,00:15:22.212,"Sorry, sir."
00:15:22.296,00:15:23.631,Spaceman First Class.
00:15:23.714,00:15:25.257,Nothing to be ashamed of.
00:15:25.591,00:15:28.302,Air Force has airmen. Space Force has spacemen.
00:15:28.886,00:15:30.971,Nothing embarrassing or comical about it.
00:15:32.514,00:15:33.349,"Yes, sir."
00:15:38.687,00:15:40.272,that sustains life.
00:15:41.106,00:15:46.445,"Fifty years ago, Americans landed on the lunar surface and took that photo."
00:15:47.112,00:15:48.656,"Hashtag awesome, huh?"
00:15:49.490,00:15:50.658,"Well, guess what, kids?"
00:15:51.533,00:15:52.660,We're going back.
00:15:53.118,00:15:54.620,Not for science this time.
00:15:54.703,00:15:56.330,Not to collect a bunch of rocks.
00:15:56.413,00:15:57.498,But to occupy.
00:15:57.581,00:15:59.333,Boots on the moon!
00:16:01.502,00:16:02.544,Boots on the moon.
00:16:03.212,00:16:14.348,"And even though this will be an international mission, harnessing the best and brightest minds from around the globe, rest assured these will be US boots."
00:16:15.808,00:16:18.102,"Boots with US feet in 'em, I mean."
00:16:19.561,00:16:22.189,Can't be certain where the boots will actually be made.
00:16:22.272,00:16:24.066,Maybe Mexico. Maybe Portugal.
00:16:24.149,00:16:25.776,We're getting bids on the boots.
00:16:25.859,00:16:27.486,"One thing's for certain, though."
00:16:27.861,00:16:29.989,Those boots are gonna have our feet in 'em.
00:16:30.072,00:16:40.207,"Seniors, if you enlist for a four-year stint as a space cadet, you can earn up to $35,000 for college."
00:16:40.290,00:16:43.794,I don't know what else to call it but a pretty sweet deal.
00:16:44.753,00:16:45.879,So what's it gonna be?
00:16:46.255,00:16:49.550,You gonna sit there like an idiot doing nothing?
00:16:50.718,00:16:54.221,Or are you gonna join Space Force and shoot for the stars?
00:16:56.140,00:16:56.974,Thank you.
00:16:59.143,00:17:00.185,Thank you.
00:17:04.189,00:17:06.191,Thank you. Thanks for coming.
00:17:06.817,00:17:08.819,"-We're signing up, General. -See you on the moon, gentlemen."
00:17:09.278,00:17:10.571,"-Hey. -Hey, bug."
00:17:10.946,00:17:12.740,I need $100.
00:17:13.073,00:17:15.576,Bobby's taking me to the desert for a pop-up concert.
00:17:15.659,00:17:17.995,Absolutely not. Hello.
00:17:18.078,00:17:20.289,"Dad, it's fine. Just, like, give me the money."
00:17:20.372,00:17:21.248,"Uh, no."
00:17:21.749,00:17:22.624,Goodbye.
00:17:22.708,00:17:24.460,"Okay, but you know Bobby. You work with him."
00:17:24.543,00:17:26.253,I know him? Bobby who?
00:17:26.336,00:17:27.588,Bobby Telatovich.
00:17:27.671,00:17:28.672,Yuri?
00:17:28.964,00:17:31.759,That's the Bobby that you've been seeing? He's ten years older than you.
00:17:31.842,00:17:33.177,"Jesus Christ, Erin."
00:17:33.260,00:17:34.636,Hello. Have a good day.
00:17:34.720,00:17:35.554,He's very sweet.
00:17:35.637,00:17:38.057,"No, he's not. He is a bad, bad man."
00:17:38.140,00:17:40.726,"Well, it wasn't my idea to move to this shithole."
00:17:40.809,00:17:43.562,I never called this town a shithole. It's a very fine town. Very fine.
00:17:43.645,00:17:49.568,"Well, I'm going with or without you, and I guess if I have no money, I'll just be totally reliant on Bobby."
00:17:50.110,00:17:52.029,Have to do whatever Bobby says.
00:17:52.654,00:17:54.907,"Don't play that game with me, Erin. It's not going to work."
00:17:58.368,00:17:59.620,I'll talk it over with Mommy.
00:18:00.079,00:18:01.080,"Thank you, General."
00:18:03.123,00:18:03.957,Hello.
00:18:31.527,00:18:32.528,How you doing?
00:18:32.611,00:18:33.529,Okay.
00:18:33.987,00:18:34.863,Yeah.
00:18:35.489,00:18:37.741,"-You eating all right? -Oh, yeah. Yeah."
00:18:37.825,00:18:42.579,"They're letting me grow radishes in a window box, and I can pretty much eat them whenever I want."
00:18:42.663,00:18:43.580,-Nice. -Yeah.
00:18:43.664,00:18:47.501,"And there's this guard, Louise, she slips me some food sometimes."
00:18:48.752,00:18:50.504,"Well, you look-- You look great."
00:18:50.587,00:18:51.630,Ugh.
00:18:52.673,00:18:53.674,Mmm.
00:18:58.971,00:19:01.807,"Mark, I'm gonna be in here a long time."
00:19:02.224,00:19:03.851,So if you need...
00:19:04.810,00:19:10.691,companionship-- No. I am your husband.
00:19:11.191,00:19:15.696,"Yes, but I'll understand if you-- Absolutely not. I don't want you to bring this up again."
00:19:15.779,00:19:16.613,Please.
00:19:18.198,00:19:19.199,How's Erin?
00:19:21.702,00:19:28.167,"Erin wants to go to a concert in the desert this weekend with this older Russian guy, who I think is just using her to get information."
00:19:28.667,00:19:32.504,Eighteen is that age where you make mistakes and figure some things out.
00:19:32.588,00:19:34.006,Do you think I should let her go?
00:19:34.089,00:19:36.091,"Well, I just don't know how you can stop her."
00:19:37.259,00:19:42.931,"Louise says if you can't do anything about a situation, you might as well lean back and let it happen."
00:19:43.891,00:19:44.850,Hmm.
00:19:55.319,00:19:57.529,"Oh, shoot. Gonna be late."
00:19:58.071,00:19:59.907,"Set me down next to the BX, please."
00:20:00.115,00:20:02.159,"Uh... I can't do that, sir."
00:20:02.242,00:20:04.286,I have to land on the designated pad.
00:20:04.369,00:20:06.914,"I am telling you to do it, so you can do it."
00:20:07.331,00:20:10.042,I have a congressional delegation down there waiting for me.
00:20:10.542,00:20:16.173,"Um, it's only another 100 yards, sir, and I'm sure you're gonna do great with the delegation, even if you are a minute late."
00:20:24.473,00:20:25.641,"Thin ice, Captain."
00:20:26.099,00:20:27.100,Thin ice.
00:20:34.149,00:20:35.108,General Naird.
00:20:39.112,00:20:40.864,"Hey, General? General. A word."
00:20:40.948,00:20:49.289,"-I'm late for a meeting. -I ran the numbers, and I can't put the bowling alley under the cyclotron unless the bowling alley is curved, -and I don't see how that works. -Get it done."
00:20:49.373,00:20:52.042,"-I have complete confidence in you, ma'am. -Okay, it's Kelly."
00:20:52.125,00:20:53.168,It's Kelly.
00:21:01.093,00:21:03.553,-Oh. Nice of you to join us. -My apologies.
00:21:03.637,00:21:05.013,Had a little chopper trouble.
00:21:06.056,00:21:07.349,"So, uh, what's good here?"
00:21:07.766,00:21:09.601,I would recommend the tuna.
00:21:10.018,00:21:11.061,Sushi?
00:21:11.144,00:21:13.730,How much are taxpayers paying to fly that in?
00:21:13.814,00:21:14.773,A sandwich.
00:21:16.191,00:21:17.985,I knew that. It was a joke.
00:21:18.068,00:21:19.069,And a good one.
00:21:19.486,00:21:20.904,But with a grain of truth.
00:21:20.988,00:21:25.075,Kick Grabaston at Air Force told us confidentially that this base was a complete waste of money.
00:21:25.158,00:21:31.164,"Ladies and gentlemen, I assure you we are on track, and Epsilon will launch at 1700 hours."
00:21:31.248,00:21:33.375,"And the Epsilon is the new spacecraft fighter, right?"
00:21:33.458,00:21:34.334,That is correct.
00:21:34.418,00:21:35.836,What kind of armament will it have on board?
00:21:35.919,00:21:37.296,Laser cannon? Pulse weapon?
00:21:38.213,00:21:40.215,I believe those are from Star Wars.
00:21:40.799,00:21:41.633,Yep.
00:21:42.050,00:21:48.890,"But if I had a laser cannon, I would probably use it to cook a Wendy's hamburger."
00:21:56.481,00:21:59.693,The Epsilon is equipped with a kinetic disabling system.
00:22:00.360,00:22:08.035,"-Meaning? -It can eject a metal net, and it is our hope that we can get this net to tangle with enemy satellites."
00:22:08.118,00:22:09.077,Exploding them?
00:22:09.953,00:22:11.079,Tangling them.
00:22:11.747,00:22:15.250,This better be one fucking flawless launch.
00:22:15.334,00:22:16.460,Six billion for a net.
00:22:16.835,00:22:17.794,Not a good look.
00:22:19.338,00:22:20.213,Excuse me.
00:22:20.297,00:22:22.257,"Oh, God. I have to take this."
00:22:24.634,00:22:25.969,"Dad, is everything all right?"
00:22:26.053,00:22:28.096,"Yeah, only your mom has run off again."
00:22:29.097,00:22:33.977,"I can't see her. I'd run after her, but I think I had a small heart attack this morning."
00:22:34.061,00:22:35.896,"You know, I'm feeling a little draggy."
00:22:35.979,00:22:38.982,"Okay, Dad, is the caretaker there? Please put the caretaker on."
00:22:39.066,00:22:41.151,He's on his way. He should be here any minute.
00:22:41.568,00:22:43.737,So how's the lady situation?
00:22:46.448,00:22:48.909,Uh-huh. You know what I had to do yesterday?
00:22:48.992,00:22:51.411,I had to crawl under the house to check a leak.
00:22:51.495,00:22:55.582,"No, Dad. Dad, don't do-- We have people to crawl under the house, Dad."
00:22:55.665,00:22:58.585,"I crawled under. I didn't tell anybody, and they didn't know I was under there."
00:22:58.668,00:23:00.379,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
00:23:00.462,00:23:03.423,"Please, Dad, don't, don't-- Don't crawl under the house!"
00:23:03.507,00:23:06.259,So how's things? How's your-- How's your wife?
00:23:07.260,00:23:08.136,She's fine.
00:23:08.220,00:23:10.806,"Yeah, you two are gonna make a great couple."
00:23:11.640,00:23:13.600,"-Is the caretaker there, Dad? -Uh, yeah."
00:23:13.683,00:23:15.268,-What are you doing? -Put the caretaker on.
00:23:15.352,00:23:16.478,-Have to get in the house. -What?
00:23:16.561,00:23:17.979,-Put the caretaker on. -Get in the house.
00:23:18.063,00:23:19.189,He wants to talk to you.
00:23:19.272,00:23:21.400,"Oh, God. I don't know what to do."
00:23:21.483,00:23:23.068,Your father should be in the hospital.
00:23:23.151,00:23:25.612,Your mama is somewhere in the streets in her nightgown.
00:23:25.695,00:23:26.905,Can you come home and help me?
00:23:26.988,00:23:29.783,"I wish I could, Jean Baptiste, but I'm having kind of a day of it myself."
00:23:29.866,00:23:32.536,"And, please, don't let my dad go under the house again."
00:23:32.619,00:23:34.621,I try. You know he do whatever he want.
00:23:34.704,00:23:35.747,"-No, no, no, no! -Ask him..."
00:23:35.831,00:23:38.250,You have to keep eyes on him. Do you understand?
00:23:38.333,00:23:40.252,"-Yes, Mr. Naird. -Ask him how his wife is."
00:23:40.335,00:23:42.003,"-How is your wife? -Ugh, God."
00:23:42.087,00:23:43.880,"All right, hold on a second, Jean Baptiste."
00:23:44.464,00:23:48.802,"Brad, I'm going to need you to task the satellite -over Nutley, New Jersey, again. -Yes, I'm on it."
00:23:54.099,00:23:55.892,She's in the Rite-Aid parking lot.
00:23:55.976,00:23:58.728,"-Text me when she's in the car. -Okay. Thank you, Mr. Naird."
00:24:06.153,00:24:07.904,"Yeah, it is a complete shit show."
00:24:08.447,00:24:09.406,Oh!
00:24:09.489,00:24:10.574,My dry cleaner.
00:24:10.657,00:24:13.326,"Yeah, yeah, they, uh, they lost my dress whites."
00:24:28.049,00:24:29.926,"-He said not to say anything. -Thank you, Brad."
00:24:30.469,00:24:32.345,"-I didn't say anything. -Well done, Bradley."
00:24:34.473,00:24:37.184,It's a six-billion-dollar decision.
00:24:37.267,00:24:38.435,We can't risk it.
00:24:38.518,00:24:42.606,"It's a lot for a scientist, but in the military, we have to risk lives."
00:24:42.939,00:24:50.489,"At 50 grand a year, it would take 120,000 years to earn $6 billion."
00:24:50.572,00:24:56.536,"That is the entire lifetime earnings of 3,000 people."
00:24:56.620,00:25:07.297,"Now, how many times can a country waste the entire lifetime earnings of thousands of its citizens without something really bad happening?"
00:25:07.380,00:25:09.508,Are you still upset about the button covers?
00:25:10.091,00:25:12.260,A thousand dollars for a plastic button cover?
00:25:12.344,00:25:13.553,That's insane!
00:25:18.058,00:25:19.768,-Two. -Shit.
00:25:19.851,00:25:20.685,One.
00:25:24.231,00:25:25.065,Sorry.
00:25:25.148,00:25:27.651,How many times do I need to apologize?
00:25:27.734,00:25:31.321,Just come out to the launch site and we'll show you.
00:25:31.404,00:25:33.949,The proper humidity for launch is 40 percent.
00:25:34.032,00:25:36.910,Today it is at 54 percent.
00:25:36.993,00:25:39.663,This can affect oxygenation and fuel burn.
00:25:40.789,00:25:43.375,The amount of fuel measured is very precise.
00:25:43.458,00:25:46.962,"If fuel is insufficient, the rocket returns to Earth without reaching orbit."
00:25:47.045,00:25:48.255,"Where you from, Chan?"
00:25:48.922,00:25:50.840,-Ohio. -Originally?
00:25:50.924,00:25:56.179,What does that have to do with any-- Are-- Are you suggesting Chan is a Chinese spy?
00:25:57.472,00:26:01.268,Ah. So we have heard from Mr. Chan.
00:26:01.351,00:26:03.019,-Doctor. -Dr. Chan.
00:26:03.728,00:26:05.272,I'd like to hear another opinion.
00:26:05.689,00:26:08.692,Perhaps somebody willing to dissent from the party line.
00:26:09.234,00:26:12.070,Who'd like to give me a good reason why we should launch today?
00:26:13.029,00:26:13.863,Anyone?
00:26:16.283,00:26:18.034,So I can weigh the pros and cons?
00:26:18.618,00:26:21.371,"Don't you have any mavericks on your team, Mallory?"
00:26:21.454,00:26:23.290,-I say launch. -Great.
00:26:23.373,00:26:24.374,And you are Dr....
00:26:24.457,00:26:25.709,Just call me Eddie.
00:26:25.792,00:26:26.960,"-Oh, shit. -Ain't a doctor."
00:26:27.043,00:26:28.628,"I go to a bunch of 'em, though."
00:26:28.712,00:26:40.557,"Wonderful. So those in favor of postponement are me and Dr. Chan, Dr. Swedberg, Dr. Bohr, Dr. Revredesh, Dr. Yamato, Dr. Lowenstein, Dr. Washington, and Dr. Zisk."
00:26:40.974,00:26:43.685,In favor of launch are you and Eddie.
00:26:43.893,00:26:45.353,"Any last name, Eddie?"
00:26:45.437,00:26:46.896,None that I care to mention.
00:26:46.980,00:26:47.981,Okay.
00:26:49.190,00:26:50.692,"Chan, what's behind your back?"
00:26:51.192,00:26:53.111,"It's an umbrella, sir."
00:26:53.194,00:26:55.614,Did you think it was a sword cane? Samurai sword?
00:26:56.740,00:26:58.992,"Would you like to examine it, sir?"
00:26:59.409,00:27:00.869,"No, we are done here."
00:27:03.413,00:27:05.665,I can't hear you over the rotors.
00:27:07.542,00:27:09.085,So is this actually happening or not?
00:27:09.169,00:27:10.920,There's no point if it's not happening...
00:27:11.004,00:27:12.422,"Excuse me, congresspeople."
00:27:12.505,00:27:13.465,Brad...
00:27:14.591,00:27:16.301,no interruptions for five minutes.
00:28:59.988,00:29:00.905,They're gone.
00:29:03.825,00:29:05.869,Congresspeople! Congresspeople!
00:29:07.370,00:29:08.872,The launch is on.
00:29:08.955,00:29:10.665,-What? -See you at 1700.
00:29:10.749,00:29:14.210,But you-- Sheila? Yeah.
00:29:14.294,00:29:16.755,"Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay."
00:29:17.839,00:29:19.924,"Don't, don't-- Please don't skitter away."
00:29:21.050,00:29:22.886,"Please, this is for your own safety."
00:29:23.136,00:29:26.723,"Come on. I'm trying to save you! Damn it, get back here."
00:29:26.806,00:29:33.104,"Our country, the oldest democracy in the world, put a man on the moon."
00:29:34.063,00:29:37.734,It was perhaps our greatest moment up until that point.
00:29:38.234,00:29:44.657,"Alongside the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and, of course, the Miracle on Ice."
00:29:45.074,00:30:01.549,"Today we launch Epsilon 6, a collaborative effort between the scientists of the United States, Japan, Europe, Turkey, Israel, Australia, And this will bring us one step closer to returning to the moon, and, from there, to Mars."
00:30:02.383,00:30:04.969,There will be setbacks along the way.
00:30:05.720,00:30:08.473,There are risks to every great endeavor.
00:30:09.557,00:30:13.770,But greatness was never won without suffering.
00:30:14.354,00:30:15.522,And sacrifice.
00:30:17.148,00:30:20.944,"I am so, so damn proud of all of you."
00:30:26.783,00:30:33.039,"without further ado, with this button, I so launch..."
00:30:33.665,00:30:35.124,Epsilon 6.
00:30:42.590,00:30:44.801,"-Liked the Miracle on Ice reference. -Thank you, Brad."
00:31:07.323,00:31:09.158,Aw. I should be tweeting this.
00:31:21.921,00:31:22.964,Where'd it go?
00:31:29.429,00:31:30.388,Not yet.
00:31:34.225,00:31:35.518,Epsilon 6 is in orbit.
00:32:01.878,00:32:06.633,"Yeah, well, he'll probably have me transferred tomorrow once he has a moment to think about it."
00:32:09.510,00:32:13.848,"You put a helicopter down in the wrong spot, and someone could get their head removed."
00:32:14.390,00:32:15.642,"Hang on a second, Mom."
00:32:21.773,00:32:25.318,Sorry I snapped at you. Glad you're on our team.
00:32:40.959,00:32:45.964,"You were right about the launch, yet you don't know anything about science."
00:32:49.300,00:32:51.052,Guess I know a little about people.
00:32:53.012,00:32:56.557,"When we we're out at the launch site, there were two tiny clouds in the sky."
00:32:57.058,00:32:58.476,Chan had an umbrella.
00:32:59.686,00:33:02.480,People like that can't handle any risk at all.
00:33:02.981,00:33:07.777,There's no way we are getting back to the moon with that kind of thinking.
00:33:08.653,00:33:11.155,That's a good observation. Well reasoned.
00:33:12.115,00:33:13.116,Cheers.
00:33:13.533,00:33:14.617,"Thank you, Doctor."
00:33:18.746,00:33:19.664,You know what?
00:33:20.039,00:33:23.001,Epsilon should be passing right about now.
00:33:26.671,00:33:27.880,Eh...
00:33:27.964,00:33:29.882,"Oh, yeah, there's a spark."
00:33:30.967,00:33:32.635,Beautiful. Wow.
00:00:26.443,00:00:28.028,-What? What is it? -Take a look.
00:00:33.908,00:00:35.160,Motherfucker!
00:00:35.243,00:00:36.369,We have to get back to work!
00:00:36.453,00:00:38.288,"Wait, are you okay to drive?"
00:00:38.371,00:00:39.456,-Yeah. -You sure?
00:00:39.539,00:00:42.292,"Oh, yeah! Acts of foreign aggression really sober me up!"
00:01:00.477,00:01:03.521,"Perhaps I come in, and we finish this."
00:01:04.773,00:01:07.525,Can't. Lots of math homework due tomorrow.
00:01:07.609,00:01:10.278,"Great, I'll help you. It's gonna be like a study date."
00:01:11.112,00:01:12.113,It's trig.
00:01:12.655,00:01:15.158,We do trigonometry in grade six back home.
00:01:19.788,00:01:22.707,"Anyway, my father wouldn't approve."
00:01:22.791,00:01:24.042,Of study?
00:01:24.501,00:01:25.752,Of you helping.
00:01:26.336,00:01:27.462,He does it with me.
00:01:27.712,00:01:29.672,Makes sure I struggle enough.
00:01:30.799,00:01:33.009,"It looks all lit up, but no car in driveway."
00:01:33.426,00:01:34.803,I don't think he's home.
00:01:35.804,00:01:37.138,Maybe I should go in.
00:01:37.847,00:01:38.765,Nah.
00:01:41.142,00:01:42.894,He promised he'd do it with me.
00:01:43.478,00:01:47.857,"He's in there, waiting to pounce 'cause I'm late."
00:01:49.400,00:01:50.944,-Bye. -Bye.
00:02:02.914,00:02:03.915,Dad?
00:02:09.671,00:02:13.591,And what do you estimate the velocities are?
00:02:15.218,00:02:16.803,Yes. Understood.
00:02:16.886,00:02:22.433,The solar panels are still close to the Epsilon unit but on a slightly different trajectory.
00:02:22.517,00:02:28.314,My guys are estimating we have around ten hours before they're too far away to reattach.
00:02:28.398,00:02:29.399,Ten hours? Easy.
00:02:29.482,00:02:31.359,We're gonna Apollo 13 the shit out of this thing!
00:02:31.442,00:02:32.652,Space Force spirit!
00:02:33.236,00:02:34.904,Assess and inventory?
00:02:35.655,00:02:38.575,The panel joints were snipped cleanly in the open position.
00:02:38.658,00:02:45.165,"It'll provide power if we can get it to touch Epsilon 6, and if we do nothing, it'll fall into atmosphere and burn up by tomorrow morning."
00:02:45.248,00:02:46.958,"Okay, team, what do we think?"
00:02:50.879,00:02:53.631,I think we should try to get the panels and reattach them.
00:02:56.217,00:02:59.262,Good. That's a good suggestion. Good.
00:02:59.971,00:03:02.015,"Okay, team, what do we think?"
00:03:02.098,00:03:08.396,Suppose we leave the panels on their trajectory and use Epsilon's adjustment thrusters to bring the craft to the panels?
00:03:08.938,00:03:10.607,-Interesting. -Great. Done.
00:03:10.690,00:03:13.484,And how are we powering the thrusters?
00:03:13.568,00:03:15.778,Because the panels were the power source.
00:03:16.988,00:03:17.947,Ah.
00:03:18.323,00:03:20.366,The connection nubs are exposed.
00:03:20.450,00:03:27.999,Microwave irradiation of the nubs from the Alaska Microwave Telescope might generate enough for thruster ignition.
00:03:28.666,00:03:30.710,The craft will be above Alaska in 15 minutes.
00:03:30.793,00:03:31.961,Uh-huh.
00:03:32.045,00:03:36.049,It's almost dinnertime in Alaska. Are we sure that the nips will be exposed?
00:03:37.967,00:03:39.219,"Nubs, sir."
00:03:41.179,00:03:42.096,What's going on?
00:03:42.430,00:03:45.558,"Oh! This is a fun sleepover kind of energy, huh?"
00:03:46.017,00:03:47.101,Get Alaska on the phone.
00:03:47.185,00:03:48.311,"-Yes, sir. -No, don't bother."
00:03:48.394,00:03:50.480,The panels are headed for the atmosphere.
00:03:50.563,00:03:52.440,"So... hurry, right?"
00:03:52.899,00:03:55.485,The nubs won't generate enough power to change directions.
00:03:55.568,00:03:56.694,Epsilon will burn up.
00:03:56.778,00:03:58.655,Never mind. Stupid. Stupid!
00:03:59.322,00:04:00.823,How did this guy get hired?
00:04:01.532,00:04:04.953,I'm the foremost aeronautical engineering theorist in Belgium.
00:04:05.036,00:04:08.748,"Oh, well, I didn't realize that Belgium had a space force."
00:04:08.831,00:04:14.212,Belgium is part of the European Space Agency because Belgium is part of Europe.
00:04:14.295,00:04:17.632,"Great, 'cause there's nothing stronger than a European Union."
00:04:17.715,00:04:18.633,What's after Brexit?
00:04:18.716,00:04:19.926,Frexit? Swexit?
00:04:20.677,00:04:22.178,Shall we brainstorm?
00:04:22.262,00:04:24.305,"Yeah, let's do that. Let's break up into teams."
00:04:24.389,00:04:27.350,Anybody under the rank of lieutenant general can take notes.
00:04:37.944,00:04:39.946,-This is the satellite. -Right.
00:04:40.029,00:04:41.990,This is what's come off of the satellite.
00:04:43.741,00:04:45.118,As long as the models match.
00:04:45.201,00:04:49.539,Keep in mind that we don't have any glasses or protractors in space.
00:04:49.622,00:04:52.208,Would the thrust chamber assembly cluster...
00:04:52.292,00:04:55.128,"La-la-la, listen. Are you familiar with the sonic boom?"
00:04:55.211,00:04:56.713,Fresh out of the oven!
00:04:56.796,00:04:57.964,Here you go. Cookies.
00:04:58.047,00:05:00.717,"Take one per person. One. Careful, they're hot."
00:05:04.095,00:05:07.098,Manned space walk from the ISS.
00:05:07.181,00:05:11.477,"Hmm. That's risky, and the ISS is 200 kilometers away."
00:05:11.561,00:05:16.274,"If we ask for outside help, the whole world will know that the Chinese bufu'd our satellite."
00:05:16.357,00:05:17.358,Next card.
00:05:17.775,00:05:21.070,Solar panels are like light sails.
00:05:21.154,00:05:22.530,Push them back with light.
00:05:22.989,00:05:25.158,"Hmm. That's interesting, Yamato."
00:05:25.533,00:05:30.079,"It is, but how would we focus the sunlight in the right direction?"
00:05:30.163,00:05:32.123,-Retask a LEOT. -Next card!
00:05:32.206,00:05:34.125,That's Low Earth Orbit Telescope.
00:05:34.208,00:05:35.209,"Next card, please!"
00:05:35.293,00:05:36.836,"Yamato, there is something there."
00:05:36.919,00:05:41.341,Why don't you take Swedberg and Carter and noodle it around a little bit?
00:05:41.424,00:05:42.258,Good idea.
00:05:43.384,00:05:45.053,"Okay, what have we here?"
00:05:45.136,00:05:46.429,This says...
00:05:46.804,00:05:47.805,Bomb.
00:05:52.602,00:05:55.313,or an adjective describing my outfit.
00:05:55.396,00:05:57.565,"All right, let's not just dismiss that out of hand."
00:05:57.648,00:05:58.691,What about a bomb?
00:05:58.775,00:06:02.487,"In my experience with the Air Force, that was very often the right answer."
00:06:02.570,00:06:04.238,"Very, very often."
00:06:04.322,00:06:06.949,Are we now pretending we have tons of time?
00:06:07.033,00:06:07.909,We don't!
00:06:07.992,00:06:12.163,"Okay, then who would like to elaborate on their idea of bomb?"
00:06:19.087,00:06:20.171,"All right, it was me!"
00:06:20.922,00:06:24.467,"Maybe it's a small smart bomb, very targeted."
00:06:25.259,00:06:26.594,I don't see how that could help.
00:06:26.677,00:06:29.722,"All right, a big fuckin' bomb. That was my first instinct, anyway."
00:06:29.806,00:06:31.140,-That's no better. -Shockwaves!
00:06:31.224,00:06:33.059,-It's a vacuum. -Space is a vacuum.
00:06:33.142,00:06:35.770,"Vandeveld, take Chan, and work out the details."
00:06:37.188,00:06:38.648,Noodle it around.
00:06:55.623,00:06:56.624,I don't get it.
00:06:57.542,00:06:58.501,I don't get it.
00:06:59.085,00:07:00.294,Tangent X?
00:07:02.213,00:07:03.339,Dad!
00:07:05.758,00:07:09.971,What assets do we have within a 100-mile radius of Epsilon?
00:07:10.054,00:07:15.768,Four pieces of space junk consisting of three bags of garbage from a 1990 shuttle mission and a Tesla.
00:07:17.061,00:07:21.858,"Also, there's something here that this computer only identifies as Mission X-12."
00:07:22.942,00:07:24.902,I don't have the security clearance to see what it is.
00:07:24.986,00:07:26.654,Use my code. I'll type it in.
00:07:26.737,00:07:27.780,Okay.
00:07:40.960,00:07:42.086,Okay. It's open.
00:07:42.170,00:07:44.005,Assess and inventory.
00:07:45.006,00:07:48.759,"This launched two months ago. On board: assault rifles, ten."
00:07:49.302,00:07:50.511,Assault rifles?
00:07:51.012,00:07:55.433,"This was not a scientifically useful mission, guys."
00:07:55.516,00:07:56.809,I kept it from you.
00:07:56.893,00:08:03.483,"It was a very successful mission, ordered by POTUS himself, which proved that assault rifles will work in the vacuum of space."
00:08:03.566,00:08:04.734,Which was never in doubt.
00:08:04.817,00:08:15.369,But now the Manchester Arms Company can advertise the R-9 as the official Space Force gun for committing mass shootings on the moon.
00:08:15.745,00:08:16.996,Or hunting.
00:08:17.079,00:08:19.290,"Okay, okay, no politics, please!"
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.253,We are all Americans here.
00:08:24.337,00:08:26.422,Even Chan and Vanden-f-flank.
00:08:26.797,00:08:28.799,-I'm an EU citizen. -Canadian.
00:08:28.883,00:08:31.135,Indian immigrant. On a green card.
00:08:31.219,00:08:34.222,-Sri Lankan with an O-1 work visa. -We don't have time for this!
00:08:34.805,00:08:35.806,"Keep going, Chan."
00:08:36.224,00:08:39.602,"Okay, also on board: assorted tool package 2-A."
00:08:39.685,00:08:41.437,"Bags of chimp food, ten."
00:08:41.521,00:08:42.939,"Bags of dog food, ten."
00:08:43.397,00:08:45.316,"Chimp, adult male."
00:08:45.733,00:08:47.235,"Dog, adult male."
00:08:47.985,00:08:52.114,I’m in charge of animal experimentation. Why were there animals on board?
00:08:52.949,00:08:54.450,Would you like to handle that?
00:08:55.034,00:09:02.041,"The White House felt very strongly that footage of a dogstronaut and a chimpstronaut would be worthwhile and would be, um..."
00:09:02.124,00:09:02.959,what's the word?
00:09:03.042,00:09:03.960,Viral.
00:09:04.669,00:09:06.963,"That reminds me, someone release Fuck Tony from the brig."
00:09:10.091,00:09:14.178,"We needed a literal dog and pony show, recast with a chimp."
00:09:14.262,00:09:15.096,Yes!
00:09:15.179,00:09:18.307,But that is something that we can work with.
00:09:18.391,00:09:21.269,We have a manned flight or man's best friend.
00:09:21.352,00:09:23.271,We have personnel in the field.
00:09:23.354,00:09:34.615,"Yes, but we have the best personnel here on the ground, and surely it is the people who invented the bus, rather than the driver, who are the best people to fix it."
00:09:34.699,00:09:37.493,You're talking to a pilot. Remember who flies the plane.
00:09:37.577,00:09:39.412,Most planes fly by autopilot.
00:09:39.495,00:09:41.872,"-Shut up, Chan. -Well, most buses, too."
00:09:41.956,00:09:44.917,"Soon, everybody will be out of a job, except scientists."
00:09:46.627,00:09:49.880,I think Yamato's light sail team are our best bet.
00:09:49.964,00:09:52.216,"Yeah, but I don't understand what that is."
00:09:52.717,00:09:57.388,Warren Buffett always says that he doesn't invest in tech because he doesn't understand it.
00:09:57.471,00:10:01.267,"Wait, look, why do you distrust scientists?"
00:10:01.350,00:10:05.938,"You scientists say don't eat carbs one day, and only eat carbs the next!"
00:10:06.022,00:10:12.069,"Because of the large sample sizes and long time periods, dietary science is by nature an imprecise sci-- Shut up!"
00:10:12.570,00:10:13.863,I wanna talk to this chimp.
00:10:14.155,00:10:15.906,Can we get a video conference going?
00:10:16.282,00:10:19.493,"Chan, does it say who trained the dog and the chimp?"
00:10:19.577,00:10:21.329,Yes. I can have them brought in.
00:10:22.246,00:10:23.664,"General, I have to warn you."
00:10:24.123,00:10:26.876,We've pretty much ignored these animals for the last two weeks.
00:10:26.959,00:10:29.920,"It seems there was no provisions made to bring them home, so we..."
00:10:30.546,00:10:31.672,ghosted them.
00:10:32.173,00:10:33.007,You what?
00:10:33.424,00:10:37.678,It's standard. The reentry capsules are too expensive for animal missions.
00:10:37.762,00:10:43.225,"So, Laika, Gordie, Dezik, -Lisa, Albert II, Albert IV... -Four."
00:10:43.309,00:10:50.483,"...were all left there after the mission was accomplished, which, in this case, was apparently obtaining cute footage."
00:10:51.233,00:10:52.109,That's horrible.
00:10:52.193,00:10:53.402,Not nice.
00:10:53.486,00:10:54.654,Shame on us!
00:10:55.571,00:10:56.989,I found some of the footage.
00:11:11.962,00:11:13.297,"That is cute, though."
00:11:14.298,00:11:16.008,Ah. Mission accomplished.
00:11:25.393,00:11:27.186,I'm Marcus and Theodore's trainer.
00:11:29.438,00:11:30.398,"Uh, Theodore."
00:11:31.649,00:11:34.360,which one would better suited to fix something?
00:11:34.902,00:11:36.904,"Okay, well, probably Marcus."
00:11:36.987,00:11:39.365,It's way more difficult for a dog to handle a tool.
00:11:41.659,00:11:48.249,"I want him to do a spacewalk outside of the capsule, and weld two solar panels back onto the Epsilon 6."
00:11:48.332,00:11:50.084,"Okay, well, that's not gonna happen."
00:11:50.167,00:11:54.672,It had better happen because it is our best hope of salvaging a satellite worth billions.
00:11:54.755,00:11:57.717,Our best hope are Yamato's light sails.
00:11:57.800,00:12:00.386,"Shh! Corporal, what are the challenges here?"
00:12:00.469,00:12:04.890,"Well, it takes quite a while to train a new behavior, and this sounds like a string of new behaviors."
00:12:05.433,00:12:10.146,"Uh, the experiment ended at least ten days ago, so I don't know what treats are left to reinforce him with."
00:12:10.229,00:12:13.357,What about duty? Is that not enough of a treat anymore?
00:12:14.108,00:12:15.151,"Look, I'll do my best."
00:12:15.234,00:12:18.738,And I will try to impress upon him the importance of this new mission.
00:12:19.613,00:12:22.950,"All right, so how do you communicate with..."
00:12:23.033,00:12:24.201,What? Marcus is it?
00:12:24.285,00:12:26.078,Uh... sign language.
00:12:26.162,00:12:28.456,You do realize this is a chimpanzee?
00:12:28.539,00:12:29.874,"Yes. Yes, of course."
00:12:29.957,00:12:32.084,A Space Force chimpanzee named Marcus.
00:12:33.002,00:12:35.838,"All right, get him up on the screen. We do not have much time."
00:12:40.634,00:12:41.635,Marcus?
00:12:43.429,00:12:44.472,"Here, Marcus!"
00:12:51.187,00:12:53.314,What is he doing? Is he signing something?
00:12:53.397,00:12:55.065,Yes. He's saying baby monkey.
00:12:56.192,00:12:58.527,"Oh. Jesus, he misses his children."
00:12:58.611,00:13:02.823,"No. In nature, chimps eat baby monkeys whenever they can their hands on them."
00:13:02.907,00:13:03.824,Google it.
00:13:04.950,00:13:07.578,Probably just sick of his regular chimp food.
00:13:09.789,00:13:12.875,This is absolutely disgusting. Look.
00:13:15.252,00:13:18.339,-Look that up. -Stop. Stop. It's a wild animal.
00:13:18.422,00:13:19.381,"Oh, my God!"
00:13:19.465,00:13:28.516,"He has a different morality, and NASA was riddled with ex-Nazis, so... who are we to cast stones? All right."
00:13:28.933,00:13:32.895,Tell Marcus we will get him baby monkey.
00:13:32.978,00:13:36.273,"But first, he has to do something for us."
00:13:36.357,00:13:37.775,Something for his country.
00:13:38.192,00:13:40.194,We're not going to give him baby monkey.
00:13:40.277,00:13:44.907,"Of course we're not, Dr. Wolf, but sometimes you have to lie to people in order to motivate them."
00:13:44.990,00:13:47.368,Like your promotion or your sabbatical.
00:13:47.451,00:13:48.744,-What? -Tell him!
00:13:49.203,00:13:52.706,We know Marcus want treat.
00:13:52.790,00:13:55.459,"But first, Marcus go outside."
00:13:58.045,00:13:59.713,"Go outside, die."
00:13:59.797,00:14:01.757,No die. Helmet.
00:14:02.550,00:14:04.718,He can put on his helmet. That's one of his behaviors.
00:14:04.802,00:14:12.101,"Also, his helmet has a laser that we can activate, and when it shines on something, Marcus will try to manipulate that thing."
00:14:15.145,00:14:17.356,Bored. Hungry. Horny.
00:14:17.731,00:14:20.276,"Tell him, I know bored."
00:14:20.901,00:14:21.986,Sorry hungry.
00:14:22.486,00:14:24.071,Horny bad.
00:14:24.613,00:14:27.032,Space Force good.
00:14:27.449,00:14:28.617,Help Space Force.
00:14:29.118,00:14:30.119,Get banana.
00:14:37.001,00:14:38.210,Banana there.
00:14:40.421,00:14:41.755,Frozen banana.
00:14:42.715,00:14:44.341,Mmm! Banana.
00:14:45.593,00:14:46.719,Why are we doing this?
00:14:47.386,00:14:50.055,Open the cage. Let him come out and put on his helmet.
00:14:55.811,00:15:00.357,"and if he looks at the right tool on the tool wall, I think I can get him to pick it up."
00:15:00.441,00:15:01.942,But those are big ifs.
00:15:05.779,00:15:07.323,There he goes. There he goes!
00:15:09.450,00:15:13.078,"There! There, he-- Look at-- He did it! He did it. He's ready for his spacewalk."
00:15:13.162,00:15:15.956,"Goddamnit, I love this fucking chimp!"
00:15:16.373,00:15:17.207,Okay.
00:15:18.626,00:15:20.961,What do you think the best tool would be for the job?
00:15:23.547,00:15:26.050,"Tell him, Pick up the cordless drill."
00:15:29.803,00:15:31.221,"How much time left, Chan?"
00:15:31.305,00:15:32.973,"Six hours, 18 minutes."
00:15:35.100,00:15:37.102,You keep playing with Murderous George.
00:15:47.071,00:15:52.159,...equals sine alpha over one plus cosine Alpha...
00:15:52.910,00:15:53.827,Grandpa?
00:15:57.706,00:16:00.292,"Hey, did those kidnappers get the money I wired them?"
00:16:00.793,00:16:05.589,"Oh, Grandpa, you have got to stop wiring money to scammers."
00:16:05.673,00:16:07.132,I had no choice.
00:16:07.216,00:16:09.802,They were gonna sell you to a brothel in Guadalajara.
00:16:09.885,00:16:11.720,That's no life for a young lady.
00:16:11.804,00:16:12.846,Okay.
00:16:12.930,00:16:17.351,"I'm gonna send you an article from the AARP about Internet scams, okay?"
00:16:17.768,00:16:19.144,I won't even open it.
00:16:19.228,00:16:22.690,"Never clink on a link with the word scam in it, honey."
00:16:23.107,00:16:25.275,There's too many con artists out there.
00:16:26.402,00:16:28.153,"Wait, what-- what time is it there?"
00:16:28.237,00:16:29.905,"Oh, jeez, I don't know."
00:16:29.989,00:16:31.865,My heart beats so slow lately.
00:16:31.949,00:16:33.492,I don't even really sleep.
00:16:34.076,00:16:36.328,Do you know anything about trig?
00:16:36.704,00:16:39.456,Trig? Yeah. That was the name of Roy Rogers' horse.
00:16:40.040,00:16:41.542,"Why, you doing a crossword?"
00:16:43.836,00:16:46.088,"Oh, no. Oh, God. Here we go."
00:16:46.630,00:16:48.590,"Uh, Erin, I'll talk to you later."
00:16:48.674,00:16:50.634,There's something going down over here.
00:16:52.761,00:16:55.264,"Uh, I gotta adjust that machine of hers."
00:16:55.347,00:16:56.932,I've been giving her too much air.
00:16:57.683,00:16:59.560,Okay. Love you.
00:16:59.977,00:17:03.105,"Love you, too. Just get that money back to me whenever you can."
00:17:07.735,00:17:09.528,"Oh, shit. He swung past again."
00:17:10.571,00:17:12.322,"I think he is slowing down, though."
00:17:12.406,00:17:14.867,"-Two hours left. -I know that, Chan. Thank you."
00:17:14.950,00:17:16.660,"Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Press the laser."
00:17:16.744,00:17:19.204,"Oh, no, he just turned away."
00:17:19.663,00:17:23.333,"Oh, cr-- No. Okay. There he goes! He's looking at it again! Right now!"
00:17:23.417,00:17:24.918,"No, missed it."
00:17:25.002,00:17:26.420,Okay. That...
00:17:26.879,00:17:28.088,Go! Now go! He's there.
00:17:28.172,00:17:30.257,Go! Press it!
00:17:33.969,00:17:35.012,All right!
00:17:35.095,00:17:36.555,"Okay, now we're talking."
00:17:37.181,00:17:40.017,"Okay. Good. Good. Finally, he's doing it."
00:17:40.476,00:17:42.811,Tell Marcus to go to the airlock.
00:17:42.895,00:17:44.855,It is time for our spacewalk.
00:17:45.439,00:17:46.356,Should I tell Dr. Mallory?
00:17:47.232,00:17:49.693,Let's surprise him with a successful mission.
00:17:52.112,00:17:53.447,What are you doing here?
00:17:53.530,00:17:54.823,"Well, I saw history being made."
00:17:54.907,00:17:57.034,"I couldn't resist being a part of it. So, up top."
00:17:57.451,00:17:59.203,I fired you 17 hours ago.
00:17:59.286,00:18:02.831,"Yeah, you know what? In my experience, there's fired, and then there's fired."
00:18:02.915,00:18:04.708,This one felt more like a fired type thing.
00:18:04.792,00:18:07.419,"But if I'm fired, I'm fired. I get it. Don't even think about it now."
00:18:13.801,00:18:14.927,"You can do it, Marcus."
00:18:22.976,00:18:24.061,Holy shit.
00:18:24.436,00:18:26.688,He's got the chimp out of the capsule.
00:18:32.528,00:18:33.904,There we go. Yeah.
00:18:33.987,00:18:35.114,All right. Good.
00:18:36.323,00:18:40.452,"Dr. Mallory, just in time to see a Space Force hero kicking ass at the scene."
00:18:41.954,00:18:44.414,"So, how fast is he approaching Epsilon?"
00:18:44.498,00:18:46.125,Two miles an hour in relative speed.
00:18:46.208,00:18:50.629,He should be able to grab the fin and use the drill to connect the panel onto the body of the craft.
00:18:50.712,00:18:53.549,-We can take over from there. -Marcus! You're doing great.
00:18:53.924,00:18:55.843,You see that fin?
00:18:56.260,00:18:57.886,That is where you grab on.
00:19:06.770,00:19:08.355,Now grab the drill!
00:19:09.398,00:19:10.482,Pick up drill!
00:19:12.734,00:19:15.028,Both! Pick up both! Fin and the drill.
00:19:18.490,00:19:20.659,Both fin and drill. Fin and drill.
00:19:26.957,00:19:28.083,-Don't do that. -Whoa.
00:19:29.418,00:19:31.211,"-Wait, he can't bend that. -All right, no, no, no!"
00:19:31.295,00:19:32.754,"No, no, no. That's very valuable."
00:19:36.717,00:19:38.427,-What is he doing? -He's frustrated.
00:19:38.510,00:19:39.469,He's frustrated?
00:19:39.553,00:19:43.056,"You tell him that I've been up for 24 hours, and my career is at stake!"
00:19:43.140,00:19:48.061,"There's really no word for career in primate sign language, so I'll just say, Food-work in danger."
00:19:51.648,00:19:52.482,Wait.
00:19:53.066,00:19:54.026,He's doing it!
00:19:55.777,00:19:57.321,Drill for banana.
00:19:57.404,00:20:00.073,Drill for the general's food-work.
00:20:12.711,00:20:15.339,Wait! Hold off. Have him hold off.
00:20:20.093,00:20:21.220,Oh!
00:20:21.303,00:20:22.888,"Whoa, whoa. Shouldn't he let go?"
00:20:22.971,00:20:27.059,-Or should he hold-- What? What should-- -I don't-- Is he supposed to let go or hold on? Get him to let go of it!
00:20:27.142,00:20:28.393,Tell him to release the drill!
00:20:28.477,00:20:31.063,"-Tell him to release! -Release, Marcus. Release! Release!"
00:20:34.650,00:20:36.360,Oh! Damn it!
00:20:36.443,00:20:38.904,"Oh, mother of God."
00:20:42.241,00:20:43.784,What happened to the tether?
00:20:43.867,00:20:45.702,"Snapped, it looks like."
00:20:45.786,00:20:46.954,"Oh, damn it."
00:20:47.037,00:20:51.875,He's heading on a trajectory to intercept the sun sometime next week.
00:20:53.126,00:20:54.711,"Oh, fuck me!"
00:20:57.130,00:20:59.091,"Marcus, Marcus, Marcus, Marcus..."
00:20:59.841,00:21:02.427,"Oh, you did not deserve that, Marcus."
00:21:03.136,00:21:04.137,You tried so hard.
00:21:04.221,00:21:05.555,"Oh, God."
00:21:06.473,00:21:07.724,"-Brad. -Yes, sir?"
00:21:08.392,00:21:12.562,See to it that he is awarded the highest service medal that he is eligible for.
00:21:13.063,00:21:15.524,"Well, he's not eligible for anything because he's an animal."
00:21:15.607,00:21:18.110,He is not an animal! He is a spaceman!
00:21:18.193,00:21:20.028,And no spaceman gets left behind.
00:21:20.112,00:21:21.530,Even one that eats babies.
00:21:22.072,00:21:23.782,And how is that different than veal?
00:21:25.492,00:21:27.869,How much will it cost to go up and rescue him?
00:21:27.953,00:21:28.912,You know what? No.
00:21:28.996,00:21:30.789,No! I don't even wanna know!
00:21:30.872,00:21:33.709,-'Cause we are doing it. -It's about 50 to 400 million dollars.
00:21:33.792,00:21:36.503,"Bleh. Okay, well, he was gonna die anyway."
00:21:36.586,00:21:37.671,No! No!
00:21:37.754,00:21:39.089,We are bringing him home!
00:21:39.589,00:21:41.383,-Can he still hear us? -Probably.
00:21:44.344,00:21:45.721,...this is General Naird.
00:21:47.264,00:21:48.432,"Thank you, Marcus."
00:21:50.642,00:21:54.896,It is very difficult for an officer to send a spaceman into harm's way.
00:21:56.315,00:21:58.483,And this...
00:21:59.526,00:22:00.986,did not go as planned.
00:22:01.570,00:22:02.529,Clearly.
00:22:03.196,00:22:14.624,"Long story short, you are going to be hurtling towards the sun for about a week, but then... a giant metal space friend will come and rescue you, Marcus."
00:22:20.964,00:22:22.049,"Yes, Marcus."
00:22:23.967,00:22:25.052,Hoo-hoo.
00:22:25.969,00:22:28.263,Hoo... hoo.
00:22:31.391,00:22:36.313,We are awarding you the Two Star Rampant of the Space Force Ultimate Service Medal.
00:22:38.774,00:22:40.984,"Marcus, God bless you."
00:22:41.943,00:22:44.112,You represent the best in all of us.
00:22:45.781,00:22:46.907,I knew that chimp.
00:22:47.699,00:22:49.242,I managed his Facebook page.
00:22:49.910,00:22:51.078,"I follow him, yeah."
00:22:54.456,00:22:55.290,All right!
00:22:59.628,00:23:01.463,-Who? -The dog.
00:23:01.546,00:23:04.591,The husky. Let's see if he can hold the drill in his mouth.
00:23:15.560,00:23:16.520,What is that?
00:23:18.438,00:23:24.444,"I believe that Marcus, at some point in the last two weeks, must have eaten Theodore."
00:23:26.738,00:23:27.739,Seriously?
00:23:28.824,00:23:31.076,"Well, that sucks."
00:23:31.159,00:23:34.329,And I just said he represents the best in all of us.
00:23:34.413,00:23:35.414,Take that back!
00:23:35.497,00:23:37.958,"Brad, no medal for that asshole."
00:23:38.708,00:23:40.627,"The dog is eaten. Oh, my God."
00:23:40.710,00:23:41.753,He ate the dog.
00:23:41.837,00:23:45.632,"Theodore is the real hero here, not that fuckin' monkey!"
00:23:46.508,00:23:47.926,How much time do we have left?
00:23:48.969,00:23:50.053,Looks like 11 minutes.
00:23:50.137,00:23:52.681,"Eleven minutes. All right, let's try Yamato's idea."
00:23:54.349,00:23:55.767,"Don't be a sore loser, Adrian."
00:23:55.851,00:23:57.978,"-Just try it! -No, it's impossible."
00:23:58.061,00:24:14.828,"His idea was to gently push the panels back toward the craft, but now your chimp has flung them way past the craft, so we would have to pull them back, and there's nothing we can transmit from Earth that will pull anything."
00:24:15.287,00:24:16.163,Are you sure?
00:24:16.246,00:24:17.289,"Yes, quite."
00:24:18.790,00:24:20.709,I wish we had a tractor beam like in Star Trek.
00:24:20.792,00:24:23.253,"-Well, we don't have-- -I know that."
00:24:23.795,00:24:25.130,'Cause they don't exist.
00:24:25.213,00:24:26.673,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:24:30.051,00:24:30.969,Whose is that?
00:24:38.226,00:24:39.394,The Chinese.
00:24:41.188,00:24:42.772,They've made a full orbit.
00:24:42.856,00:24:44.107,Those assholes.
00:24:48.570,00:24:50.739,"Oh, no, no, no, Marcus."
00:24:51.198,00:24:52.032,No.
00:24:52.115,00:24:53.116,Marcus!
00:24:53.700,00:24:55.744,"Mar-- No. Resist, Marcus."
00:24:56.077,00:24:57.621,Do not go willingly.
00:24:58.330,00:25:00.248,"Remember the military code, Marcus."
00:25:00.832,00:25:03.126,No! You will resist the enemy at all costs.
00:25:03.710,00:25:05.045,"Marcus, don't..."
00:25:08.673,00:25:09.841,You're not doing it.
00:25:12.093,00:25:13.220,Dog-eating bastard!
00:25:21.311,00:25:22.771,Sec Def is on the phone.
00:25:36.826,00:25:37.744,Hello.
00:25:41.706,00:25:46.795,"Yes, I took over the rescue efforts personally, and it all pretty much went sideways."
00:25:48.880,00:25:51.132,We've got a chimpstronaut in Chinese hands.
00:25:53.009,00:25:54.761,I take full responsibility.
00:25:59.808,00:26:02.477,I was talked out of it by the science team.
00:26:04.729,00:26:07.065,I will tender my resignation to POTUS.
00:26:10.944,00:26:13.822,Sounds like you've been awake and working for two days straight.
00:26:20.245,00:26:21.288,"Thank you, sir."
00:26:28.878,00:26:30.630,"Hey, thanks for the pineapple, sir."
00:26:30.714,00:26:32.090,-I got it last night. -Hmm?
00:26:32.507,00:26:33.466,Oh.
00:26:33.550,00:26:35.135,"Jesus, it feels like a week ago."
00:26:37.804,00:26:41.308,"Well, I really screwed up tonight, spaceman."
00:26:41.850,00:26:43.226,"We all make mistakes, sir."
00:26:44.019,00:26:45.186,Did anybody die?
00:26:46.855,00:26:47.772,Theodore.
00:26:49.107,00:26:50.233,The dogstronaut.
00:26:50.317,00:26:52.193,-The dog... -He was a good boy.
00:26:52.861,00:26:54.446,"So cute, and he could catch."
00:26:58.450,00:27:01.911,It's our first Space Force casualty. It's just sort of weighing on me.
00:27:03.455,00:27:05.206,"Yeah, um, how did it happen?"
00:27:06.374,00:27:08.084,He was eaten by a crewmate.
00:27:09.169,00:27:10.337,A chimpstronaut...
00:27:11.046,00:27:13.548,who is now a POW in a Chinese satellite.
00:27:20.055,00:27:21.681,"You have a difficult job, sir."
00:27:25.769,00:27:28.313,That chimp better keep his fuckin' mouth shut.
00:27:51.002,00:27:51.920,Hey.
00:27:52.462,00:27:53.380,Bug.
00:27:55.757,00:27:57.258,"Oh, hey."
00:28:00.428,00:28:01.262,Not good.
00:28:02.472,00:28:04.808,"There was some stuff I didn't understand, so..."
00:28:05.600,00:28:07.977,"Okay, well, let's figure it out."
00:28:08.395,00:28:09.854,"No, come on. You look exhausted."
00:28:09.938,00:28:12.524,I'll make it up later in the year with extra credit or something.
00:28:12.607,00:28:15.652,No. Save extra credit for a rainy day.
00:28:16.361,00:28:19.114,We have time. Yeah... Yep. Let's do it.
00:28:21.324,00:28:22.325,Dad.
00:28:22.409,00:28:23.868,It's okay. I'm good.
00:28:24.828,00:28:30.667,You can bet the dads in China and Russia and India aren't too tired to help with a little math homework.
00:28:31.418,00:28:32.919,"You need to know math, kiddo."
00:28:33.628,00:28:36.005,You could invent the thing that saves the world.
00:28:37.632,00:28:40.510,"That's sweet, but come on, let's be real."
00:28:42.178,00:28:44.431,I'm being as real as a cinder block.
00:28:49.477,00:28:53.857,"Okay, so on this one, we're dealing with radians."
00:28:53.940,00:28:56.401,"-So... -Oh, radians. Here we go."
00:28:56.484,00:29:00.530,"Okay, so the sine value is just the height of the Y coordinate or two."
00:29:00.613,00:29:02.365,But now they wanna know the arcsine.
00:29:02.449,00:29:03.324,Or the...
00:00:19.561,00:00:20.520,Do you see it?
00:00:21.521,00:00:26.943,"No mention of rats, mice, rodents, rodent blood pressure tests?"
00:00:27.027,00:00:27.944,None.
00:00:28.903,00:00:29.863,Wait.
00:00:29.946,00:00:31.948,"Oh, that says House appropriations."
00:00:32.032,00:00:33.992,So close to mouse appropriations.
00:00:34.075,00:00:36.119,This is an affront.
00:00:52.469,00:00:53.428,Is he in?
00:00:53.511,00:00:54.596,"Yes. Yes, he is."
00:00:57.640,00:00:58.808,What is this regarding?
00:00:58.892,00:01:16.701,"I am testifying with General Naird today at the budget hearing in Washington, and I would like to know why my science budget pales in comparison to the riches devoted to turning space into an orgy of death."
00:01:19.162,00:01:20.080,ID?
00:01:20.997,00:01:23.625,I left my ID at the lab.
00:01:24.751,00:01:26.086,No one gets in without ID.
00:01:26.169,00:01:31.549,"Brad, will you tell this prepubescent killing machine who I am?"
00:01:31.883,00:01:34.260,"Uh, Duncan, this is Dr. Adrian Mallory."
00:01:35.261,00:01:37.931,"Well, I could confirm that if he presented some ID."
00:01:38.348,00:01:41.434,I entered the building without ID.
00:01:43.144,00:01:44.145,"Oh, wow."
00:01:44.604,00:01:45.980,They should not have allowed that.
00:02:04.999,00:02:05.917,Anything?
00:02:06.376,00:02:08.586,The project where I grow fur on plants is gone.
00:02:09.045,00:02:10.839,"Well, that one was weird."
00:02:12.924,00:02:13.925,You're weird.
00:02:31.860,00:02:34.821,Thank you. Doctor... Mallory.
00:02:35.613,00:02:36.573,You knew that.
00:02:36.990,00:02:39.826,"-Sorry, uh, he's in a meeting now. -What meeting?"
00:02:39.909,00:02:41.786,Last-minute media prep with Fuck Tony.
00:02:42.120,00:02:45.915,Fuck Tony says it's the most important single hour of the general's life.
00:02:47.041,00:02:49.627,"General Naird, you disgust me. You're disgusting."
00:02:49.711,00:02:50.670,Nobody's gonna say that.
00:02:50.753,00:02:53.214,"This is a congressional budget hearing, not a roast."
00:02:53.298,00:02:57.552,"Yeah, well, as your head media consultant, I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't prepare you for the worst."
00:02:57.635,00:03:00.180,"General Naird, you steaming pile of vomit!"
00:03:00.263,00:03:01.556,I hope you die!
00:03:01.639,00:03:02.557,"Okay, stop."
00:03:02.640,00:03:09.314,"Space Force is a bright, shiny new object that is asking for the least amount of money of any of the armed forces."
00:03:09.397,00:03:10.690,We haven't started any wars.
00:03:10.773,00:03:12.525,We haven't had a My Lai yet.
00:03:13.026,00:03:14.736,They're gonna embrace us with open arms.
00:03:15.403,00:03:17.405,"General Naird, I did not say you could step down!"
00:03:17.488,00:03:21.242,Stop! I'll be back at 2100 hours. Hold down the fort.
00:03:21.326,00:03:23.995,Does all your authority on base transfer to me while you're gone?
00:03:24.078,00:03:25.914,All my responsibility. Half my authority.
00:03:25.997,00:03:28.625,Oh. Is it okay if I still call you in case anything...
00:03:28.708,00:03:31.044,"Brad, come on, dude. You're a general."
00:03:33.087,00:03:34.589,"See you on the flip, mustache."
00:03:34.672,00:03:37.050,"Hey, candies are for my visitors."
00:03:37.383,00:03:38.384,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:03:38.468,00:03:40.929,"Do you also own a van, you fucking creep?"
00:03:41.846,00:03:45.016,"Yes, I do. And when my snoring wakes my wife, I sleep in it."
00:03:47.018,00:03:50.897,Where is my rat blood pressure research funding?
00:03:50.980,00:03:52.065,Do you hear yourself?
00:03:52.148,00:03:54.609,And why are all my pages redacted?
00:03:54.692,00:03:59.072,"What, you don't think I could have any valid thoughts about expenditures?"
00:03:59.155,00:04:01.741,"Perhaps, but as a scientist, you have a loyalty to reason."
00:04:01.824,00:04:03.117,Makes you a little untrustworthy.
00:04:03.201,00:04:04.327,Scientists are weird.
00:04:04.410,00:04:06.412,It's why you're the only Muppet that speaks nonsense.
00:04:06.496,00:04:07.789,Even Animal uses words.
00:04:07.872,00:04:08.915,"Adrian, here's the deal."
00:04:09.332,00:04:11.501,We are testifying for the House Armed Services Committee.
00:04:11.584,00:04:17.423,They are not going to give us a billion dollars if we tell them we're going to use it to give rats stomachaches.
00:04:23.846,00:04:25.223,"Sir, ready to go to the tarmac?"
00:04:25.723,00:04:26.933,"Oh, good, you didn't leave yet."
00:04:27.016,00:04:29.018,"Hey, bug! What are you doing?"
00:04:29.102,00:04:31.104,Ditching first period just to see me off?
00:04:31.187,00:04:33.481,No. Got suspended. Gave a teacher the finger.
00:04:34.607,00:04:38.611,"You know, one time, my history teacher gave me a C, so I planted drugs in his desk."
00:04:38.695,00:04:41.489,"And now, he lives under a bridge like a troll."
00:04:41.572,00:04:43.241,"What do you mean, you got suspended?"
00:04:43.324,00:04:46.035,"Yeah. My day's wide open, so I can go to DC with you."
00:04:46.119,00:04:49.622,"You know, since you're responsible for moving us to this hellhole and ruining my life."
00:04:49.706,00:04:55.420,"I mean, the least you could do is let me see my old friends and shop at stores that don't, like, exclusively sell Wrangler jeans."
00:04:56.421,00:04:57.338,"-Captain Ali? -Yes, sir?"
00:04:57.422,00:05:00.675,Change of plans. I would like you to keep an eye on my daughter today.
00:05:00.758,00:05:08.057,"Yes, sir. That is something I'm capable of doing, sir, in addition to flying helicopters in war zones, which is my job."
00:05:10.184,00:05:14.981,"Rat hemoglobins are substantially-- Jesus, just let him fly the fucking thing!"
00:05:16.733,00:05:18.484,You're talking! He's gotta fly!
00:05:21.612,00:05:23.781,"-Whoops. -What do you mean, whoops?"
00:05:25.616,00:05:28.077,"-So, what are we gonna do? -I don't know, same thing I always do."
00:05:28.161,00:05:30.955,"Go to the gym, walk the base a little, maybe get some soft serve."
00:05:31.039,00:05:32.290,Probably hit the gym again.
00:05:33.333,00:05:35.918,"Oh, I'm sorry. I bet you wish you didn't flip off your teacher now, huh?"
00:05:36.002,00:05:38.671,"Oh, and I bet you wish you didn't either. Or worked a little harder in high school."
00:05:38.755,00:05:42.800,"Bitch, I got straight A's and a math degree from the University of Hawaii, so back up."
00:05:48.056,00:05:49.891,How big is this stupid base?
00:05:50.433,00:05:51.559,Government waste.
00:05:51.642,00:05:54.604,No wonder my high school is just a row of portables by the highway.
00:05:54.687,00:05:56.439,What are you talking about? The gym is right up there.
00:05:56.564,00:05:57.648,Or don't you live here?
00:05:57.732,00:05:58.775,"No, I live in DC."
00:05:58.858,00:06:02.028,"Ah, that's right, yes. All right, that's the Pickering Building."
00:06:02.111,00:06:05.323,Sometimes I take my lunch over there and watch them build rocket engines.
00:06:05.782,00:06:09.243,And that is where Dr. Banner works with the gamma rays.
00:06:09.660,00:06:12.914,"Oh, and that's where we store the vibranium that we stole from Wakanda."
00:06:12.997,00:06:14.749,"-Cool. -Hey, what's up, Scraps?"
00:06:16.459,00:06:17.377,You know those clowns?
00:06:18.127,00:06:19.253,And what's Scraps?
00:06:19.837,00:06:21.964,"Uh, yeah, I go to school with them."
00:06:24.675,00:06:25.510,'Kay.
00:06:30.223,00:06:32.475,to a hearing on military waste?
00:06:40.983,00:06:41.943,What?
00:06:42.026,00:06:44.404,I feel you overthinking this hearing.
00:06:45.071,00:06:47.949,Isn't any thinking to you overthinking?
00:06:48.032,00:06:52.995,"A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week."
00:06:53.079,00:06:54.163,General Patton.
00:06:54.247,00:06:57.208,A pint of sweat will save a gallon of blood.
00:06:57.291,00:06:58.251,General Patton.
00:06:58.334,00:07:04.590,"Someone needs to lead, and someone needs to follow, but they are both equally on the same team."
00:07:04.674,00:07:05.508,General Naird.
00:07:07.176,00:07:09.387,"No, no, no! Not you. Joint Chiefs only."
00:07:15.768,00:07:17.186,"Ah, these hearings are bullcrap."
00:07:17.270,00:07:19.856,"We don't come clean about half our defense spend, so what's the point?"
00:07:19.939,00:07:22.150,"Well, it's not bullcrap for Space Force."
00:07:22.233,00:07:24.152,First time with your keister in the hot seat.
00:07:24.235,00:07:25.194,Might be your last.
00:07:28.531,00:07:29.574,"Hey, guys!"
00:07:29.657,00:07:30.992,-What are you doing? -Get out!
00:07:32.660,00:07:34.662,"Oh, come on, man."
00:07:43.421,00:07:45.965,"Whatever, I don't know. Let me know."
00:07:46.048,00:07:47.800,Marines at your disposal.
00:07:47.884,00:07:49.927,"I appreciate the offer, but we're good."
00:07:50.344,00:07:53.764,"In fact, this little dust-up with the Chinese made us even stronger."
00:07:53.848,00:07:55.057,I'm kinda glad it happened.
00:07:55.558,00:07:59.604,I just hope that our monkey doesn't crack under Chinese interrogation.
00:08:00.021,00:08:00.855,What?
00:08:01.772,00:08:04.609,Never mind. My main concern is our head scientist.
00:08:04.692,00:08:06.861,He is just a pain in the ass.
00:08:06.944,00:08:08.404,"Yeah, I don't know how you do it."
00:08:08.488,00:08:11.073,Imagine lab coats telling us how to invade Iraq.
00:08:11.157,00:08:14.452,"Oh, you can't bomb there, that's an endangered yak."
00:08:15.703,00:08:17.788,"You seem pretty calm, Naird."
00:08:17.872,00:08:18.831,Why wouldn't I be?
00:08:19.373,00:08:22.210,Pentagon's got a record-high budget request.
00:08:22.502,00:08:23.711,And all because of you.
00:08:24.170,00:08:30.968,A new branch that's done nothing but blow up on launchpads and let the Chinese slide their chopsticks up our buttholes.
00:08:31.052,00:08:32.303,That's disgusting.
00:08:32.386,00:08:34.013,"Oh, it's disgusting, all right."
00:08:34.805,00:08:41.395,Disgusting that Space Force was taken from me and handed to a New Jersey nincompoop.
00:08:41.479,00:08:44.941,But I'm sure the committee will come to that conclusion after we testify.
00:08:45.358,00:08:46.901,"Get your junk out of my face, please."
00:08:48.069,00:08:49.654,-Kneel. -What?
00:08:49.737,00:08:56.953,"Kneel before me and pledge loyalty to the great General Kick Grabaston, and I'll show mercy to you at the hearing."
00:08:57.370,00:08:59.997,Space Force isn't going anywhere.
00:09:00.706,00:09:02.208,And neither am I.
00:09:02.625,00:09:10.007,"Oh, you're going somewhere, Naird. By the end of this hearing, I'm going to reabsorb Space Force and its budget, like the world's most powerful tampon."
00:09:11.425,00:09:14.470,I always thought that you were a tampon.
00:09:15.471,00:09:19.475,Tampons spend all day in vaginas.
00:09:20.518,00:09:22.562,"Nothing manlier, if you ask me."
00:09:23.479,00:09:25.565,"All day? Five hours, tops."
00:09:26.190,00:09:29.610,Three if you have uterine fibroids. She knows what I'm talking about.
00:09:30.444,00:09:33.614,"Acknowledge my gender again, and I will fuck you in the ass."
00:09:34.740,00:09:35.825,Duly noted.
00:09:37.618,00:09:40.121,Duly noted.
00:09:46.836,00:09:49.380,I can't believe this is how you spend your free time.
00:09:49.463,00:09:51.090,"You know, you don't have to just sit there."
00:09:51.173,00:09:53.968,"You could maybe work out, or anything."
00:09:54.051,00:09:56.220,"No, I'm very aware of my options. Thank you."
00:09:57.305,00:10:00.141,"Hey, Scraps. See any joints laying around that we could smoke?"
00:10:00.224,00:10:01.475,"That was a great one, Julio."
00:10:04.020,00:10:06.105,Hey. You two. Get back here.
00:10:09.317,00:10:14.822,"Yeah, you, uh, you said something disrespectful to my guest, so you're gonna take a little run. East launchpad."
00:10:15.239,00:10:17.199,"-That's very far, ma'am. -And back."
00:10:17.658,00:10:20.953,"-That's almost twice as far, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am, right away. Running now."
00:10:24.749,00:10:30.129,"So, the story behind Scraps is-- Oh, hey, I don't need to know."
00:10:44.560,00:10:48.981,"Well, uh, DC popular is very different -from Wild Horse popular. -Ah."
00:10:49.065,00:10:53.444,"In Wild Horse, what matters mostly relates to, uh, dirt bikes."
00:10:56.280,00:11:01.577,"Okay, but did you even give anyone at school a chance, or did you just stroll in there like a white Malia Obama?"
00:11:01.994,00:11:03.746,They didn't give me a chance.
00:11:03.829,00:11:05.790,Okay? I even pretended to like hunting.
00:11:06.290,00:11:07.541,"But they asked, Hunting what?"
00:11:07.625,00:11:09.877,-And then I panicked and said whales. -You did not.
00:11:17.718,00:11:19.428,"Dr. Mallory, is it?"
00:11:20.596,00:11:23.015,General Grabaston. Hi.
00:11:23.849,00:11:24.892,Big fan.
00:11:25.476,00:11:26.769,-Thank you. -Big fan.
00:11:27.895,00:11:29.980,"So, how's it going at Space Force?"
00:11:30.564,00:11:31.774,Could be better.
00:11:33.693,00:11:34.694,Naird is a brute.
00:11:35.194,00:11:36.070,Mm.
00:11:39.865,00:11:41.659,Damn shame about the ice.
00:11:43.536,00:11:44.537,What ice?
00:11:45.162,00:11:47.456,The ice that's melting everywhere on Earth.
00:11:48.958,00:11:50.126,Uh... yes.
00:11:50.209,00:11:53.629,"Yeah, I... I care about the ice..."
00:11:54.880,00:11:57.883,and the animals that depend on that ice to live.
00:11:58.342,00:11:59.510,Ice birds.
00:11:59.969,00:12:01.178,Ice bears.
00:12:03.180,00:12:04.014,Hmm.
00:12:04.348,00:12:05.391,You know...
00:12:06.851,00:12:11.814,"if the committee loses faith in Naird today, I would run Space Force."
00:12:13.357,00:12:17.486,And I would have you operating with twice the funding and none of the oversight.
00:12:18.362,00:12:21.949,I'm not sure we should be having this conversation.
00:12:22.783,00:12:24.744,"Oh, we're not having this conversation."
00:12:25.953,00:12:27.371,I'll see you at the hearing.
00:12:34.003,00:12:36.213,Prepare to have your mind blown.
00:12:36.714,00:12:38.257,Please be aliens. Please be aliens.
00:12:38.340,00:12:43.012,"Okay, well, not quite. But like our aliens, we do keep it frozen and in locked containers."
00:12:43.554,00:12:44.930,Meal Armstrong's?
00:12:45.014,00:12:48.934,"One small snack for a man, one large soda for mankind."
00:12:49.018,00:12:49.852,-Wow. -Yes!
00:12:49.935,00:12:51.937,It is the best acai in Wild Horse.
00:12:52.021,00:12:53.939,"Well, I mean, it's the only acai in Wild Horse."
00:12:54.023,00:12:55.483,"But it is so, so good."
00:12:55.983,00:12:58.152,Hey. I know you.
00:12:58.235,00:12:59.737,I've seen you taking a bath.
00:13:00.154,00:13:00.988,-Mm-- -What?
00:13:01.822,00:13:03.866,Your dad has photos of you on his desk.
00:13:04.325,00:13:05.993,One when you're little and in the tub.
00:13:06.410,00:13:07.912,"You're General Naird's daughter, right?"
00:13:08.412,00:13:10.748,"Although you look, um, different in person."
00:13:11.499,00:13:12.541,Less happy?
00:13:12.875,00:13:14.668,"No, I think you changed your hair."
00:13:15.211,00:13:16.337,Duncan Tabner.
00:13:16.420,00:13:17.505,"Sweetwater, Alabama."
00:13:18.464,00:13:19.507,Erin Naird.
00:13:19.590,00:13:20.674,"Abortionville, Blue State."
00:13:20.758,00:13:21.967,Whoo! There she goes.
00:13:22.051,00:13:23.844,"That was a joke. She's joking, of course."
00:13:23.928,00:13:24.970,And I got it.
00:13:26.847,00:13:28.599,"Uh, well, ladies."
00:13:28.682,00:13:29.975,Enjoy your ack-eye.
00:13:30.351,00:13:33.145,It'll put that two-year-old's grin right back on your puss.
00:13:33.229,00:13:34.188,My puss?
00:13:35.022,00:13:36.106,Southern for face.
00:13:36.190,00:13:38.108,"Well, it's Northern for pussy."
00:13:38.776,00:13:40.736,So I wouldn't go around saying that to people.
00:13:42.071,00:13:42.988,Erin Naird.
00:13:43.405,00:13:44.281,Ma'am.
00:13:46.992,00:13:47.910,Okay.
00:13:47.993,00:13:50.246,"No. Okay, I'm not mad at that. No, he's cute, right?"
00:13:50.329,00:13:51.872,"And he's about your age, so..."
00:13:52.957,00:13:56.043,"I'm seeing someone. And, uh, my age, too young for me."
00:14:03.843,00:14:04.844,Congressman Schugler.
00:14:04.927,00:14:06.303,"What, no hug?"
00:14:12.476,00:14:15.187,"Well, that was awkward and horrible."
00:14:15.729,00:14:18.649,The man is about to grill you. Let him bring it in for the real thing.
00:14:23.320,00:14:24.530,Representative Pitosi.
00:14:26.073,00:14:27.074,What are you doing?
00:14:29.201,00:14:30.202,I was just greeting you.
00:14:30.286,00:14:32.288,"We don't have that kind of relationship, General."
00:14:32.371,00:14:33.455,"Yes, understood."
00:14:34.915,00:14:35.916,Well done.
00:14:36.000,00:14:37.334,Earning your pay.
00:14:37.418,00:14:39.753,Maybe just play on your phone for the rest of the day.
00:14:41.463,00:14:42.756,He doesn't know how to hug.
00:14:42.840,00:14:45.467,Why am I in trouble because boomers are weird around women?
00:14:47.011,00:14:47.928,Okay.
00:14:48.345,00:14:49.179,You were right.
00:14:52.141,00:14:54.184,"About as healthy as a bowl of grape ice cream, too."
00:14:56.729,00:14:58.230,You came to see Daddy at work?
00:14:59.148,00:15:00.107,"And also, your father?"
00:15:00.858,00:15:01.692,Hey.
00:15:01.775,00:15:02.776,-Hi. -Give me a hug.
00:15:04.194,00:15:07.031,"-Eh... -Oh, uh, this is... this is Angela."
00:15:07.114,00:15:09.909,"Oh, are, um-- are you guys doing this?"
00:15:12.369,00:15:14.496,We have much cultural exchange.
00:15:15.998,00:15:18.584,"Yeah, sure. I'm gonna... I'm gonna call you later."
00:15:19.043,00:15:19.877,Okay.
00:15:19.960,00:15:20.878,Okay. Bye.
00:15:20.961,00:15:22.129,Yeah. Bye.
00:15:24.548,00:15:25.466,Bye.
00:15:33.015,00:15:34.683,-Nice guy. -Don't.
00:15:34.767,00:15:37.937,"-Yeah, no, feels like a good match. -Shut up."
00:15:38.020,00:15:42.816,"I mean, he's gotta be the nicest of all the creepy older Russian dudes that you could be ruining your life with, right?"
00:15:44.068,00:15:45.319,"And, uh, who are you dating?"
00:15:46.070,00:15:47.404,The clutch on your helicopter?
00:15:47.488,00:15:49.406,"What? No, girl, I'm just jealous, okay?"
00:15:49.490,00:15:57.331,"Look, if I could get some super snappy-dressing foreign guy to like me because of my proximity to classified information, I would totally jump at it."
00:16:04.338,00:16:08.926,Hmm. No panty lines on the angry young congresswoman.
00:16:09.677,00:16:11.011,You know what that means.
00:16:11.345,00:16:12.554,No panties.
00:16:12.638,00:16:15.849,They actually make panties that don't show panty lines.
00:16:17.017,00:16:19.478,"Oh, you think she's wearing those types of panties?"
00:16:19.561,00:16:25.818,I believe there's a higher degree of probability she's wearing those type of panties than no panties at all.
00:16:25.901,00:16:28.070,Would you two stop saying panties?
00:16:28.153,00:16:30.114,"You can't give me an order, Naird."
00:16:30.197,00:16:31.115,Gentlemen...
00:16:32.408,00:16:33.367,they're ready for you.
00:16:34.827,00:16:35.744,Panties.
00:16:37.830,00:16:42.584,Since when did you and Kick Grabaston start hanging out and talking about women's underwear?
00:16:42.668,00:16:44.920,He wanted my input. I gave it to him.
00:16:45.004,00:16:47.756,"That reminds me. Keep quiet in there, unless I give you a signal."
00:16:48.507,00:16:51.010,Did we agree on a signal? I don't think so.
00:16:51.093,00:17:00.144,"How about, Dr. Mallory will now explain how man and his barbaric nature will destroy space, as he has the Earth."
00:17:00.853,00:17:01.770,Too wordy.
00:17:01.854,00:17:03.647,I'll just tap on the table twice with a pencil.
00:17:03.731,00:17:04.648,Mm.
00:17:23.333,00:17:24.251,Uh...
00:17:24.543,00:17:33.969,"General Naird, you're asking for a 150% increase in the budget for Space Force?"
00:17:34.636,00:17:36.972,"Uh, and that will be used..."
00:17:38.307,00:17:39.933,To defend America.
00:17:42.144,00:17:50.069,"Chairwoman, This, uh, budget looks A-OK to me!"
00:17:50.652,00:17:53.739,"And, uh, General Naird, thank you."
00:17:53.822,00:18:08.128,"I feel safer knowing that we have satellites that can rain God's holy hellfire upon our enemies on this majestic, flat Earth of ours."
00:18:09.338,00:18:12.674,"Yes, Congressman, this Earth is certainly majestic."
00:18:13.175,00:18:14.468,And flat.
00:18:14.802,00:18:17.262,"Well, jury's still out on that one."
00:18:18.305,00:18:25.896,"General Naird, I'll take some of the gentlemen from Oklahoma's time that he yielded to ask you one brief question."
00:18:26.980,00:18:28.524,Why do you exist?
00:18:29.441,00:18:35.614,The Yankees won the 1961 World Series and my parents got a little carried away with their celebration.
00:18:37.533,00:18:38.700,Okay!
00:18:43.914,00:18:47.417,It was much cheaper under General Grabaston and the Air Force.
00:18:48.001,00:18:50.045,Cheap generals are like cheap enchiladas.
00:18:50.129,00:18:51.797,You end up paying for it on the back end.
00:18:52.631,00:18:59.304,"All due respect, but under General Grabaston, our supremacy in space was eclipsed by the Russians and the Chinese."
00:18:59.930,00:19:04.268,It is my job to keep space safe for American interests.
00:19:04.351,00:19:06.562,"In order to do that, I need money."
00:19:06.645,00:19:09.106,How exactly have you been making it safe?
00:19:09.189,00:19:11.775,"-That is top secret. -Yes, I can see that."
00:19:12.359,00:19:15.529,Or should I say... I can't see that.
00:19:16.780,00:19:22.369,"Well, we are making scientific leaps that are not top secret."
00:19:22.786,00:19:27.833,Making the world a better and cleaner place.
00:19:29.042,00:19:30.043,Great.
00:19:30.961,00:19:32.045,Tell us about that.
00:19:35.799,00:19:37.551,Mm. Mm-hmm.
00:19:51.064,00:19:55.319,"I can yield to our youngest member, who rarely is."
00:19:56.486,00:20:01.950,"The committee recognizes the congresswoman from New York, Anabela Ysidro-Campos."
00:20:03.660,00:20:04.494,Yes.
00:20:04.828,00:20:06.246,-General Naird. -Hello.
00:20:06.330,00:20:12.377,"Your entire attitude seems to be, Give us money and don't look while we militarize space."
00:20:16.006,00:20:17.925,It is a condition.
00:20:18.300,00:20:19.885,Drinking Bird Syndrome.
00:20:20.510,00:20:21.887,"Look, space..."
00:20:23.555,00:20:24.973,is hard.
00:20:30.854,00:20:35.359,"If you haven't settled on a motto yet, may I suggest that that become the new Space Force motto."
00:20:36.568,00:20:38.278,Well... exactly.
00:20:42.449,00:20:43.367,Tap!
00:20:46.620,00:20:49.831,Mmm. Tap-tap. Tap-tap.
00:20:51.291,00:20:52.125,Tap-tap.
00:20:59.466,00:21:00.300,Tap-tap.
00:21:01.176,00:21:02.302,Just gentle. Gentle.
00:21:03.095,00:21:06.098,Look... Just gentle!
00:21:07.808,00:21:09.935,"-Uh... -No, seriously."
00:21:10.018,00:21:11.520,What am I supposed to do here?
00:21:12.312,00:21:14.564,Do you know what it's like to have no one to talk to?
00:21:15.357,00:21:18.986,"I mean, if you don't have a dirt bike here or you're not sniffing glue..."
00:21:20.821,00:21:21.738,Forget it.
00:21:25.826,00:21:26.910,Get a job.
00:21:28.829,00:21:29.788,Like where?
00:21:31.081,00:21:33.083,I'm a high school junior with no skills.
00:21:33.917,00:21:37.629,"Well, okay, off base, we've got the cowboy boot store down by the highway."
00:21:37.713,00:21:40.924,"Uh, the best restaurant in town, also known as the strip club."
00:21:42.009,00:21:46.930,"Actually, I know a place that is closer to your house that needs a sustenance procurement coordinator."
00:21:47.639,00:21:48.473,What?
00:21:48.557,00:21:51.476,It's just military for soft serve slinger.
00:21:51.893,00:21:53.979,"Yeah, I mean, it's either that or the strip club."
00:21:54.062,00:21:56.565,"With your skinny butt, you're probably gonna make more selling soft serve."
00:21:56.648,00:22:00.235,"Oh, that is until you eat enough soft serve to make more at the strip club."
00:22:00.402,00:22:03.488,It's kind of a eat for the job you want kind of vibe.
00:22:03.572,00:22:04.531,Mmm.
00:22:06.992,00:22:07.993,what is this?
00:22:09.453,00:22:10.454,An orange?
00:22:10.537,00:22:12.080,How much do you think it costs?
00:22:12.622,00:22:13.457,A dollar?
00:22:13.540,00:22:15.459,How much do you think it costs Space Force?
00:22:15.542,00:22:18.837,"-Dollar-fifty? -It costs $10,000."
00:22:23.717,00:22:31.725,"you sent up a variety of fresh, non-dehydrated foods, including one orange, at the transport cost of $10,000."
00:22:31.808,00:22:38.148,"Yeah, yes. It's been our policy since NASA to allow astronauts one pound of the food of their choice at each resupply."
00:22:38.231,00:22:39.941,"Even if it's a $10,000 orange?"
00:22:40.359,00:22:42.527,"Well, sometimes it's just not about saving money."
00:22:42.611,00:22:45.822,"Sometimes it is, when it's a budget hearing."
00:22:45.906,00:22:47.449,"But, please, defend it."
00:22:47.532,00:22:54.748,"I wanna be able to tell my constituents on food stamps why your agency needs a $10,000 orange."
00:22:58.668,00:22:59.878,"All right, I'll try."
00:23:03.131,00:23:06.385,One thing you learn in the military is that money doesn't matter.
00:23:07.427,00:23:08.470,People matter.
00:23:10.263,00:23:13.725,"Thousands of people working tirelessly, day and night."
00:23:13.809,00:23:20.816,And we may have spent a billion dollars to put one astronaut in a position where they can do something that'll benefit everybody.
00:23:21.566,00:23:28.949,And that one astronaut may be a human being who is risking her life in a very dangerous pursuit.
00:23:29.491,00:23:33.245,"A human being who is not doing it for the money, by the way."
00:23:34.079,00:23:42.087,A human being who is battling fear and exhaustion and uncertainty.
00:23:43.213,00:23:49.719,"And who has been eating dehydrated mac and cheese, mixed with her own filtered urine, for the last month."
00:23:52.139,00:23:54.558,I want her to have a taste of the Earth.
00:23:55.517,00:23:57.394,And remember what she's fighting for.
00:24:10.657,00:24:15.120,"Well, there is no substitute in space for this planet."
00:24:16.455,00:24:20.750,"You cannot make an orange out of powder and urine, no matter how hard we try."
00:24:20.834,00:24:22.669,Only God can make an orange.
00:24:22.752,00:24:27.007,"Well, whoever made it, we're the only place in the universe you can get it."
00:24:27.090,00:24:30.260,We better take care of this planet and the people who live here.
00:24:32.429,00:24:35.474,And what better reminder of the Earth than an orange.
00:24:36.141,00:24:41.271,"Because an orange, like the Earth itself, is perfect and round."
00:24:41.771,00:24:43.106,It's a flat rectangle!
00:24:45.942,00:24:53.200,Come on. We are putting people's lives at risk in the pursuit of science to solve our many problems.
00:24:55.327,00:24:57.662,You don't get to drive my vulva!
00:24:57.746,00:25:01.541,You don't get to drive my vulva! You don't get to drive my vulva!
00:25:01.625,00:25:04.794,"No, no! This is Space Force!"
00:25:05.462,00:25:09.799,The Supreme Court nomination hearing is Wednesday.
00:25:13.553,00:25:15.138,"All right, sorry. Sorry."
00:25:17.849,00:25:30.362,"To sum up, this country has enough wealth that we can give an astronaut who is risking her life for all of us an orange every once in a while."
00:25:31.530,00:25:37.285,"Pretty words, but I'm still not hearing any specifics about the science."
00:25:37.494,00:25:41.122,How do you help my constituents on food stamps?
00:25:41.206,00:25:45.794,"Maybe it would be cheaper to give your constituents a nutritional paste, if all you care about is money."
00:25:45.877,00:25:47.587,Would you like us to work on that?
00:25:48.004,00:25:51.841,"Dr. Adrian Mallory, Chief Scientist, Space Force."
00:25:52.300,00:26:16.950,"If you want specifics, we are developing a new climate satellite that will provide such precise forecasts that the advance warning times for tornadoes and hurricanes will be tripled, potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives and hundreds of billions of American dollars in disaster relief."
00:26:17.534,00:26:18.660,Sounds wonderful.
00:26:19.035,00:26:20.120,It is.
00:26:20.203,00:26:24.791,But what if a foreign aggressor shoots that satellite down?
00:26:25.750,00:26:32.465,Not every country with a presence in space believes in good for all.
00:26:40.140,00:26:44.227,Dr. Mallory came to me recently with a project near and dear to his heart.
00:26:45.061,00:26:47.564,Something that could benefit all humankind.
00:26:47.897,00:26:50.150,I believe it involved rat diarrhea.
00:26:50.942,00:26:56.156,And I would like him to be able to continue his experiments without fear of them being destroyed.
00:26:56.239,00:26:57.324,Wouldn't you agree?
00:26:59.117,00:27:02.912,"General Naird, Dr. Mallory, you may step down."
00:27:06.166,00:27:07.876,"Not you, General Grabaston."
00:27:08.376,00:27:10.462,I have questions for you.
00:27:12.213,00:27:19.387,Why did you spend eight million to upgrade the F-22 with ostrich leather seats?
00:27:27.145,00:27:29.356,like the magical Earth.
00:00:26.443,00:00:27.986,"Do you have your duct tape, spaceman?"
00:00:29.237,00:00:40.290,"If you are hit by a Red Team BB, you will only have a couple of seconds to patch it before the air is released from your suit, and you are marked dead by the game master."
00:00:41.249,00:00:42.876,"Because there's no air on the moon, sir?"
00:00:44.044,00:00:46.963,"General, if we get hit-- Try not to get hit."
00:00:47.505,00:00:50.675,Try to hit those Air Force boys on the Red Team first.
00:00:50.759,00:00:51.760,"Yes, sir!"
00:00:52.635,00:00:59.559,"But say I poke a hole on my suit, like on a cactus, should I just lay down and wait until Space Flag is over, sir?"
00:00:59.642,00:01:01.061,"Wait, wait, laying down?"
00:01:01.728,00:01:03.480,"What the fuck is that, laying down?"
00:01:03.563,00:01:05.440,You seem very intent on laying down.
00:01:07.609,00:01:08.860,It's just that...
00:01:09.736,00:01:12.030,"Sir, it's just a lot of weight, and it's hot."
00:01:14.157,00:01:15.366,It's gonna be hot.
00:01:15.450,00:01:17.494,"Yeah, we're gonna be in the desert. What else?"
00:01:17.577,00:01:18.912,"And I'm already kinda sleepy, sir."
00:01:20.497,00:01:24.000,"Don't worry. In the field, each one of you will be wearing an exoskeleton."
00:01:25.919,00:01:27.253,Iron Man pants.
00:01:27.337,00:01:33.093,"You'll be paired with a scientist who can remote-control walk you back to base, whether you're conscious or not."
00:01:33.176,00:01:35.011,"Permission to nap while the pants walk us back, sir?"
00:01:35.095,00:01:35.929,No!
00:01:36.262,00:01:38.139,No napping. Newborns nap.
00:01:38.223,00:01:39.766,"Come on, spaceman."
00:01:39.849,00:01:41.851,The war game is very important.
00:01:41.935,00:01:46.272,"It will help us pick which exoskeleton system to buy, Lockheed or Raytheon."
00:01:46.356,00:01:48.233,"Mr. Scientist, which one is more comfortable?"
00:01:50.110,00:01:51.986,All you need to do is fight hard.
00:01:52.070,00:01:53.238,Fight your best.
00:01:53.321,00:01:57.158,And know that Dr. Mallory is getting the best equipment for the Space Force team.
00:02:01.246,00:02:05.166,the XR-11 exoskeleton can take a lickin' and keep on tickin'.
00:02:05.250,00:02:06.918,"Now, what about limb movement?"
00:02:08.336,00:02:09.379,Texting.
00:02:11.840,00:02:14.092,"Astronauts should help each other, not shoot each other."
00:02:14.175,00:02:16.052,"Well, kind of missing the point."
00:02:16.636,00:02:21.307,"He's not a big fan of war games, but he's definitely the person who should be deciding our tech."
00:02:21.683,00:02:22.642,Spacemen!
00:02:23.434,00:02:26.980,This is a great adventure that we are embarking on today.
00:02:27.063,00:02:33.319,"We are training for the worst-case scenario, but the best-case scenario is colonizing the galaxy."
00:02:34.112,00:02:41.202,"Imagine, years from now, you could be on some distant star, harvesting corn."
00:02:42.370,00:02:43.621,Ah. Here he is.
00:02:43.705,00:02:44.706,Dr. Mallory.
00:02:44.789,00:02:52.213,"Well, I've sat through both presentations and, as theater, they make Wild Horse High School look like the West End."
00:02:52.297,00:02:54.924,-Ha. Sorry. -Which will give us the biggest edge?
00:02:55.008,00:02:56.384,I'd go with Lockheed.
00:02:56.759,00:02:57.802,Lockheed! Good!
00:02:57.886,00:03:03.600,Both are only designed to get the spacesuits back to base after an astronaut is killed.
00:03:03.683,00:03:05.768,Spacesuits cost millions.
00:03:08.354,00:03:09.397,Roger that. Over and out.
00:03:09.480,00:03:12.734,Neither is designed to save the men.
00:03:12.817,00:03:14.110,-The systems are... -What am I doing?
00:03:14.194,00:03:16.529,...basically high-tech body bags.
00:03:16.613,00:03:25.330,"-But the military's ritual slaughter-- -It's the one-- Well, we have the best system."
00:03:25.830,00:03:27.415,Now let's talk about tactics.
00:03:31.336,00:03:32.837,for perhaps it could be his last.
00:03:32.921,00:03:33.963,What are you doing?
00:03:34.380,00:03:35.965,I'm joining the battle as an embed.
00:03:36.424,00:03:37.800,Going Vice News on this shit.
00:03:37.884,00:03:40.136,"If I see you on the battlefield, I'll shoot you in the face."
00:03:40.220,00:03:41.262,You will not see me.
00:03:41.763,00:03:50.647,"The hardened general keeps his distance, unsure how to show his admiration Good, I'm glad you're here."
00:03:51.356,00:03:54.943,I am going to need you by my side all day today.
00:03:55.026,00:03:57.695,You are the closest thing that I have to a number two.
00:03:57.779,00:04:01.241,"So in war games, that makes you my aide-de-camp."
00:04:01.324,00:04:04.744,"In real life, that makes me totally uninterested."
00:04:04.827,00:04:05.954,Five years!
00:04:06.037,00:04:09.332,Five years I was Kick's aide-de-camp at the Air Force war games.
00:04:09.791,00:04:13.461,"Oh, he would love nothing better than to see me fall flat on my face."
00:04:13.544,00:04:19.592,"Okay. Well, then, thanks for the title of Make Believe Assistant with No Real Power in a Fake War, I guess."
00:04:20.051,00:04:22.095,"So, first things first. The pre-brief."
00:04:22.178,00:04:25.390,"Now, the pre-brief is sort of a stare down between boxers."
00:04:25.473,00:04:26.307,Ah!
00:04:26.391,00:04:30.853,"Well, then my vast experience in the ring will finally come in handy."
00:04:31.396,00:04:32.230,You know...
00:04:32.313,00:04:35.275,"All right. I wasn't gonna get into any of this, but..."
00:04:37.485,00:04:40.363,These guys have a very strict code of behavior.
00:04:41.114,00:04:45.702,Maybe this code is arbitrary and excessively macho.
00:04:46.995,00:04:51.249,Why do you ask to be ridiculed?
00:04:51.958,00:04:55.503,Wha-- What about my behavior invites ridicule?
00:04:55.586,00:04:56.504,Well...
00:04:57.338,00:04:59.674,the way you... walk.
00:04:59.757,00:05:02.468,Arms... like noodles.
00:05:02.552,00:05:03.553,Kind of...
00:05:05.680,00:05:08.725,"All right, so we're going into battle. And you are dressed like Annie Hall."
00:05:09.684,00:05:11.144,Maybe you could wear something...
00:05:11.227,00:05:13.229,"Uh, how do-- Okay."
00:05:14.105,00:05:15.690,Maybe you could be more...
00:05:16.357,00:05:17.775,Take off-- Ah. God.
00:05:17.859,00:05:18.818,Um...
00:05:23.239,00:05:32.540,"So, now I'm getting fashion advice from a man who's worn the same 50/50 nylon-cotton twill trousers for the past 40 years?"
00:05:32.623,00:05:34.917,"Adrian, there is power in conformity!"
00:05:36.002,00:05:38.129,-You dress for defense. -Exactly.
00:05:38.212,00:05:43.301,Whereas my style is a brave expression of my fearless personality.
00:05:43.384,00:05:46.012,"Isn't that ironic, Mr. Military?"
00:05:46.095,00:05:51.642,"No, no, no, no, no. Do not-- Do not-- Okay. All right. I get what you're doing."
00:05:56.564,00:05:59.192,"Well, well, look who it is, boys!"
00:05:59.609,00:06:01.569,General Mark Nerd.
00:06:01.652,00:06:02.570,Clever.
00:06:02.653,00:06:08.951,"I suppose if I tried real hard, I could come up with a humorous spin on your last name, General Grabaston."
00:06:09.494,00:06:10.536,Dr. Mallory.
00:06:10.620,00:06:11.829,"Hello, General."
00:06:11.913,00:06:13.873,Here to observe the exoskeletons?
00:06:13.956,00:06:17.502,"I'm Mark's right-hand man, his aide-de-camp."
00:06:18.211,00:06:19.712,"Very progressive, Naird."
00:06:20.254,00:06:22.590,"This is my guy, Clarke Luffinch."
00:06:22.673,00:06:23.508,Yo.
00:06:25.593,00:06:31.224,"We're going to eat your guts, Nerd, and wipe our asses with your skin."
00:06:32.100,00:06:32.975,"Oh, really?"
00:06:33.768,00:06:37.063,We're gonna eat your guts and wipe your asses with our skin.
00:06:39.399,00:06:41.776,So the game of mental chess has begun.
00:06:42.193,00:06:44.987,Hungry Hungry Hippos at best.
00:06:51.702,00:06:53.079,What's going on with the lights?
00:06:57.917,00:07:05.842,"As a representative of the Army, they are making me referee today's Space Flag between Space Force and Air Force Red Team."
00:07:06.592,00:07:15.601,"Welcome to a day of multiple challenges testing you in all areas of space fighting readiness, culminating with a mock infantry skirmish on the moon."
00:07:15.685,00:07:16.686,Question.
00:07:16.769,00:07:23.651,"If we win all the events based on science and computing, do we really need to compete in lunar laser tag?"
00:07:23.734,00:07:24.735,"Oh, absolutely."
00:07:25.153,00:07:26.529,The skirmish is worth 100 points.
00:07:26.612,00:07:29.198,"The rest of the contests are worth, I don't know, let's say 30."
00:07:29.282,00:07:34.078,"So, in other words, it basically boils down to a slap fight on the moon?"
00:07:36.122,00:07:43.880,"Okay. The Air Force has selected the Raytheon exoskeleton, and Space Force has chosen the exoskeleton from Lockheed."
00:07:44.881,00:07:46.466,"Jim, I'm right here. I can hear you."
00:07:46.549,00:07:50.928,"If I may, Bert, I'm concerned about some of the physical aspects of the competition."
00:07:52.763,00:07:54.307,Kick's airmen are in their prime.
00:07:54.390,00:08:02.231,"Space Force is a new branch, consisting of mostly very green teenage recruits and older astronauts who spent ten years getting their PhD."
00:08:05.151,00:08:07.737,And you are a huge excuse.
00:08:07.820,00:08:09.322,May I be excused?
00:08:09.405,00:08:16.496,"I would like to join my scientists for the tech events, while they pump themselves up for Testosterone Tag."
00:08:17.413,00:08:20.124,"I'm sorry, I just got distracted by Naird's shoes."
00:08:20.500,00:08:23.794,"My God, Naird, how do you keep them so clean?"
00:08:25.713,00:08:28.132,So shiny I can see up your skirt.
00:08:28.216,00:08:29.467,They're supposed to be shiny.
00:08:29.550,00:08:30.927,"Mommy, they're so shiny."
00:08:31.010,00:08:33.888,Shake hands. We'll see each other on the battlefield.
00:08:34.388,00:08:35.348,"Cute pumps, Nerd."
00:08:37.350,00:08:38.559,I love that suit.
00:08:38.643,00:08:41.145,It's not a suit. It's an ensemble.
00:08:41.229,00:08:43.397,-Chosen with great care and tact. -Shh.
00:08:44.106,00:08:47.860,Seems they found a chink in your poly-blend suit of armor.
00:08:47.944,00:08:51.656,"I refuse to be ashamed that I enjoy a bright, shiny pair of shoes!"
00:08:51.739,00:08:53.658,"Oh, and Adrian, Testosterone Tag?"
00:08:53.741,00:08:56.160,"No, no. Not fitting of an aide-de-camp."
00:08:56.244,00:08:59.121,A title as meaningless as war itself.
00:08:59.539,00:09:00.873,War is not meaningless.
00:09:01.749,00:09:05.086,War is what democracies use to protect freedom.
00:09:05.169,00:09:07.964,And freedom is what allows you to talk that sass.
00:09:08.047,00:09:09.215,Sass?
00:09:09.298,00:09:11.384,I knew you would fixate on that word.
00:09:11.467,00:09:13.052,Sass. Mm-hmm.
00:09:17.181,00:09:18.099,Spacemen!
00:09:18.432,00:09:19.892,Can anyone tell me what that is?
00:09:24.522,00:09:25.773,That is the moon.
00:09:26.232,00:09:28.276,"Flat, desolate, nowhere to hide."
00:09:28.359,00:09:38.703,"Actually, despite its lack of tectonic plates, the moon's surface is a complex topography -of mountains and craters, among-- -Okay, okay, okay."
00:09:38.786,00:09:40.746,"Thank you, Bill the Science Guy."
00:09:41.497,00:09:43.958,Thank you very much. I will handle the training session.
00:09:44.041,00:09:47.753,"Now, once the battle begins, we will separate into two groups."
00:09:47.837,00:09:52.800,"The first group will make a wedge formation in the front, and the second group will remain in reserve."
00:09:53.217,00:09:54.552,Reserve. Called it.
00:09:55.428,00:09:59.473,Dr. Mallory has also supplied us with our firearms.
00:10:00.683,00:10:04.854,This is the Daisy 760 Pumpmaster.
00:10:05.605,00:10:06.814,"Sir, is that a BB gun?"
00:10:12.320,00:10:14.322,"Now, of course, that's-- that's not PC, but..."
00:10:17.366,00:10:18.492,was deliberate.
00:10:18.576,00:10:25.916,"On the moon, the difference between life and death can be as small as a BB-sized tear in a spacesuit."
00:10:26.000,00:10:28.085,Ah. That's why we've got duct tape.
00:10:28.461,00:10:31.047,"Yes, spaceman, duct tape will save you."
00:10:31.464,00:10:34.550,"But don't worry, these aren't the only weapons you'll have."
00:10:34.634,00:10:39.138,Each spaceman will be issued a cuticle scissor set!
00:10:39.597,00:10:42.558,This will be used to pop spacesuits at close range.
00:10:43.893,00:10:46.312,-Guard these with your life. -Can I keep one of those scissors?
00:10:46.395,00:10:47.605,I'm always losing mine.
00:10:47.688,00:10:50.650,"These are combat scissors, soldier."
00:10:51.150,00:10:52.151,Okay?
00:10:52.568,00:10:58.616,"Many of you may not have used one of these for quite some time, so I'm gonna give you a little refresher course."
00:11:00.785,00:11:01.786,You gotta pump it!
00:11:02.995,00:11:04.455,Pump it up! Pump it hard!
00:11:04.997,00:11:11.879,"The harder you pump, the more air will be in the chamber, the more penetrating power that BB is gonna have."
00:11:12.338,00:11:13.422,"Really takes a while, sir."
00:11:13.506,00:11:20.096,It takes about as long as it took the minutemen to reload their muskets at Lexington and Concord.
00:11:21.013,00:11:28.187,"And... like those... great patriots, we will be operating in..."
00:11:28.270,00:11:29.397,Powdered wigs?
00:11:29.480,00:11:31.691,...a staggered formation.
00:11:32.066,00:11:35.945,"Where the front line will fire, while the back line reloads."
00:11:36.987,00:11:37.905,Any questions?
00:11:40.449,00:11:41.450,Reload!
00:11:42.743,00:11:43.744,Second line!
00:11:45.329,00:11:46.247,Reload!
00:11:47.206,00:11:48.165,First line!
00:11:48.541,00:11:49.375,Fire!
00:11:49.792,00:11:51.627,Ow! You box of shit!
00:11:52.837,00:11:56.048,Let's hope we never face a battalion of empty cans.
00:11:56.132,00:11:57.341,You're not helping.
00:11:57.425,00:11:58.300,Fire!
00:12:00.219,00:12:01.971,"Nice shot, Staff Sergeant."
00:12:02.054,00:12:02.888,"Kiki Rhodes, sir."
00:12:02.972,00:12:05.015,"Captain Ali, a good staff sergeant is a treasure."
00:12:05.099,00:12:06.517,-Treasure this one. -Sir.
00:12:07.768,00:12:09.562,"Well, stick with me, Staff Sergeant."
00:12:09.645,00:12:10.813,Follow my lead out there.
00:12:11.188,00:12:14.150,"Well, I'd feel better if you would have knocked the can down."
00:12:14.233,00:12:15.359,You ever been in combat?
00:12:15.443,00:12:20.072,"I was top of my class in Intro to Combat Theory, and I got an A-plus on my end-of-term paper."
00:12:20.156,00:12:21.282,-Impressive. -Thank you.
00:12:21.365,00:12:23.117,I hope I live long enough to read that.
00:12:23.200,00:12:28.539,I... do hope you wish you live long enough-- It was a damn good paper. They don't just hand out A-plusses.
00:12:29.790,00:12:32.418,Calculate orbital period. What's our radial trajectory?
00:12:32.501,00:12:34.879,"Correcting for lunar gravitation, 707.4."
00:12:35.671,00:12:38.048,"You're a motherfucking math genius, Vandeveld!"
00:12:38.507,00:12:39.717,Satellite's in range.
00:12:39.800,00:12:40.843,Locked and loaded.
00:12:41.886,00:12:44.138,"Say goodbye, bitch."
00:12:46.599,00:12:47.516,Boom!
00:12:50.436,00:12:51.270,Yes!
00:13:04.658,00:13:07.411,"-These are, uh, pretty bulky. -Yeah."
00:13:07.495,00:13:08.579,The suits are bulky.
00:13:12.625,00:13:13.918,The scissors. They're tiny.
00:13:14.001,00:13:15.377,"Tony. Yo, do you mind?"
00:13:15.461,00:13:19.089,"Every spaceman has his role to play, and mine is generating content."
00:13:23.469,00:13:25.387,Tony! Get out of my face.
00:13:25.471,00:13:26.806,"Yes, ma'am. Right."
00:13:29.058,00:13:30.893,"-You're dead. -Fuck you, man."
00:13:39.193,00:13:41.195,"Chambers, give me a burpee."
00:13:41.278,00:13:42.530,"Not possible, sir."
00:13:42.613,00:13:44.114,You can't even do a burpee in that thing?
00:13:44.740,00:13:46.075,I couldn't do one before.
00:13:46.158,00:13:47.284,"I can do one, sir."
00:13:48.911,00:13:49.745,"Oh, my God!"
00:13:49.829,00:13:55.209,I'm sure you'll all be pleased to hear that the science team-- Da-da-da-da-da.
00:13:55.292,00:13:57.169,Why did you choose the Lockheed suit?
00:13:57.253,00:13:59.547,These guys can't even move in these things.
00:13:59.630,00:14:02.341,I'm sure the Air Force is having the same problems.
00:14:08.639,00:14:10.516,May I speak to you outside for a moment?
00:14:14.144,00:14:15.354,"Little privacy, please?"
00:14:15.437,00:14:16.438,"Sir, yes, sir."
00:14:17.314,00:14:18.482,Jesus Christ.
00:14:20.109,00:14:22.570,"You picked the wrong exoskeleton on purpose, didn't you?"
00:14:22.653,00:14:23.487,What?
00:14:23.571,00:14:24.947,"You couldn't help it, huh?"
00:14:25.489,00:14:28.492,"You hate the whole idea of war games, Space Flag."
00:14:28.576,00:14:33.122,"Space should be a zone of wonder, not of conflict and death."
00:14:33.205,00:14:36.417,"No, I don't think that's it at all. I don't think it's a moral issue."
00:14:36.500,00:14:37.877,I think you're scared.
00:14:37.960,00:14:43.674,"I think that you stink at sports, and a long time ago, you decided that if you can't win, you're not gonna play."
00:14:45.551,00:14:46.802,"Oh, I can just see it now."
00:14:46.886,00:14:52.308,"Little nerdy Mallory sitting in the nurse's office, pretending to have a tummy ache so he doesn't get picked last for basketball!"
00:14:52.808,00:14:54.518,My father was a diplomat.
00:14:54.602,00:14:57.229,I went to the American school in Geneva.
00:14:57.313,00:14:58.814,We downhill skied.
00:14:58.898,00:15:00.774,"Oh, so you were captain of the ski team, huh?"
00:15:00.858,00:15:02.610,"Fuck you, Mark."
00:15:24.006,00:15:27.092,"I, uh, sometimes sing to relieve stress."
00:15:27.176,00:15:29.261,"Oh, no, no. No judgment here."
00:15:29.345,00:15:33.223,"When I wanna blow off steam, I go to the tunnel under Building 5."
00:15:33.307,00:15:35.851,The acoustics in there are unreal.
00:15:37.394,00:15:38.312,"You sing, too?"
00:15:38.979,00:15:42.983,"No, I usually scream into the darkness until my voice gives out."
00:15:43.567,00:15:44.818,Highly cathartic.
00:15:46.236,00:15:48.030,-Mm. -So... well...
00:15:49.239,00:15:50.199,hang in there.
00:15:51.116,00:15:52.242,It... uh...
00:15:52.368,00:15:53.661,-I don't-- -That's my hat.
00:15:53.744,00:15:55.829,That's yours. Okay. Okay.
00:15:55.913,00:15:56.830,Goodbye.
00:15:57.164,00:15:58.082,So...
00:15:59.375,00:16:00.334,All right.
00:16:00.793,00:16:02.127,Don't know why I did that.
00:16:06.507,00:16:07.341,Working.
00:16:07.800,00:16:09.593,Why didn't you return my DMs?
00:16:09.677,00:16:12.346,Social media cleanse. The internet's for trolls.
00:16:12.429,00:16:15.724,Ugh. Come on. There aren't as many trolls as people say.
00:16:15.808,00:16:18.769,The existence of troll farms hasn't been 100% proven.
00:16:20.688,00:16:23.399,Are you gonna order anything? The line's kind of long.
00:16:24.191,00:16:26.026,Why Erin is not being nice to Yuri?
00:16:26.110,00:16:28.612,I thought we were going to have lots and lots of babies.
00:16:28.696,00:16:31.740,We can name them after your father's mother.
00:16:32.116,00:16:33.283,What was her name?
00:16:35.619,00:16:38.580,Do you even like me? Or are you just using me to get to my dad?
00:16:41.834,00:16:45.671,Yuri's love is like sprinkles around your ice cream heart.
00:16:46.296,00:16:51.343,"Yuri and Erin is like Kim and Greg from that popular American TV show, Yes, Dear."
00:16:51.885,00:16:54.054,Makes your father so happy the way I treat you.
00:16:54.138,00:16:57.266,As happy as his first childhood pet.
00:16:57.349,00:16:58.475,Which was called...
00:17:01.478,00:17:04.148,"-Uh, just getting dessert, sir. -Before a battle?"
00:17:04.231,00:17:06.066,God! Why are you all so lame?
00:17:10.404,00:17:11.739,I just put my order in.
00:17:11.822,00:17:14.491,Right now is when you decide to have a backbone? Let's go!
00:17:16.869,00:17:18.704,"Shut up, dude. Shut up. What is wrong with you?"
00:17:18.787,00:17:21.498,"This ain't the third grade, ma'am. Take your froyo like an adult."
00:17:21.915,00:17:24.376,"I am an adult. As a matter of fact, I outrank you."
00:17:24.460,00:17:28.297,"So why don't you go ahead and walk in front of me while I finish this, Sergeant? That's an order."
00:17:29.882,00:17:31.842,"What's up, guys? I used to be in Air Force."
00:17:31.925,00:17:34.011,"Hey, let me get a quick snap with the winners, huh?"
00:17:34.094,00:17:35.763,"Yeah, now we're talking."
00:17:39.641,00:17:41.935,The science portion of Space Flag has concluded.
00:17:43.270,00:17:44.438,Congrats to...
00:17:45.272,00:17:46.190,whoever won.
00:17:46.273,00:17:48.317,All that matters is lunar combat.
00:17:49.068,00:17:50.736,It's for 100 points.
00:17:51.236,00:17:57.367,"If your suit is popped, just go limp, and you'll be marched home like a sack of manure on a pair of stilts."
00:17:57.451,00:18:00.496,"The mission's over for you, but those pants fight another day."
00:18:01.413,00:18:03.540,"Man, we about to get BB'd up."
00:18:03.624,00:18:05.000,I'd rather just get regular shot.
00:18:05.084,00:18:06.710,You know how bitches love the gunshot wounds.
00:18:06.794,00:18:07.628,"Whoa, whoa."
00:18:07.711,00:18:09.588,Bitches don't like to be called bitches anymore.
00:18:09.671,00:18:11.632,"Yeah, well, bitches don't like a lot of things, so..."
00:18:11.715,00:18:17.137,You know that word originated in the 15th century as a way to demean women who were just trying to express their sexual desires?
00:18:17.221,00:18:18.514,Why do you know that?
00:18:18.597,00:18:22.810,My college gender studies professor made me write a paper about it after I called her a bitch.
00:18:22.893,00:18:24.895,-She sound like a bitch. -Hey! Come on.
00:18:25.854,00:18:27.147,"But she was one, two times."
00:18:33.695,00:18:34.780,"Hey, do you have a charger?"
00:18:34.863,00:18:36.698,Yeah. Charge this.
00:18:39.409,00:18:40.536,Do you have a charger?
00:18:51.004,00:18:51.922,Air Force ready?
00:18:53.674,00:18:54.758,Space Force ready?
00:18:55.884,00:18:56.760,Uh...
00:18:57.719,00:18:58.679,Yes.
00:19:00.264,00:19:01.348,Let's get it on!
00:19:03.976,00:19:05.227,Ho! Hooah!
00:19:09.523,00:19:11.441,Here they come! Spacemen!
00:19:11.984,00:19:14.486,Now is the time to prove ourselves. Now is the time to shine!
00:19:14.570,00:19:16.071,"-Get off your phone! -Okay, yeah."
00:19:16.155,00:19:17.239,Pump your weapons!
00:19:17.614,00:19:18.448,Pump 'em!
00:19:19.032,00:19:20.534,Pump 'em! Pump 'em!
00:19:22.202,00:19:24.079,Alpha Squad! Move out!
00:19:31.211,00:19:32.296,Ow. Oh.
00:19:33.797,00:19:35.007,Some gentle stretching!
00:19:35.883,00:19:36.717,Move out!
00:19:47.561,00:19:48.979,I'm gonna eat your liver!
00:19:52.900,00:19:55.402,"Phew. Boy, it's a hot one today."
00:20:02.034,00:20:03.493,Is this footage in slo-mo?
00:20:19.051,00:20:20.636,"That's it, Space Force, cover and run."
00:20:26.350,00:20:27.434,"Ah, God."
00:20:38.445,00:20:40.113,"Oh, shit! That was close!"
00:20:40.197,00:20:41.490,Ah. They're everywhere!
00:20:41.573,00:20:44.076,"Come on! Get up, spacemen! Show some heart!"
00:21:04.096,00:21:05.806,-God. -Okay.
00:21:08.892,00:21:09.977,"I'll avenge you, bro."
00:21:10.060,00:21:10.978,Kick their ass!
00:21:12.145,00:21:14.314,"Come on, you got this, man. Make me proud!"
00:21:15.649,00:21:17.567,"Go, spaceman. Go, spaceman."
00:21:17.651,00:21:19.861,"Yeah, that's the Space Force spirit! Attack!"
00:21:19.945,00:21:21.822,Yeah. Go. Go.
00:21:23.949,00:21:25.617,That's ugly.
00:21:25.701,00:21:28.036,"Captain Ali, it's up to you. Advance!"
00:21:29.997,00:21:31.957,"Uh, don't worry."
00:21:32.040,00:21:33.917,My paper was on pincer movements.
00:21:34.001,00:21:35.210,"Cover me, Sergeant."
00:21:35.294,00:21:36.169,Okay.
00:21:36.253,00:21:37.129,I got you!
00:21:41.800,00:21:44.678,"Yeah, baby! That's what I'm talking about!"
00:21:46.179,00:21:47.889,"-Damn, I'm down. -Yeah."
00:21:53.437,00:21:54.354,Hooah!
00:22:19.004,00:22:20.130,"-Oh, my God. -Oh."
00:22:20.756,00:22:24.634,You mother-- I'll go warm up the truck.
00:22:26.678,00:22:29.473,"Like Hitler in his bunker, Naird has been abandoned by everyone."
00:22:31.475,00:22:32.642,That's my fault.
00:22:32.726,00:22:38.899,"And that is my fault, and I apologize, right-- Non-- Press! Press!"
00:22:38.982,00:22:41.651,Press! Press! Press!
00:22:42.069,00:22:43.320,What the fuck?
00:22:52.788,00:22:54.373,"How's it going, General?"
00:22:54.456,00:22:59.002,"Congratulations, Adrian, you made your point by making us all look like fools."
00:22:59.586,00:23:01.421,Crushing the spirits of your own team.
00:23:02.047,00:23:04.466,"My God, I even picked you first."
00:23:05.634,00:23:06.510,You know what?
00:23:06.593,00:23:10.764,Remind me to never put myself in a situation where I need your help.
00:23:36.415,00:23:37.332,Chan.
00:23:40.210,00:23:41.420,Be ready with it.
00:23:43.880,00:23:45.048,Where are you going?
00:23:46.758,00:23:49.386,The general needs his aide-de-camp.
00:23:53.348,00:23:55.642,"Dude, this is the weirdest day."
00:23:56.643,00:23:57.477,Hooah!
00:23:58.520,00:23:59.646,Advance!
00:24:14.536,00:24:16.037,Kali Maa.
00:24:17.122,00:24:19.541,Kali Maa shakti de!
00:24:28.675,00:24:31.303,"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
00:24:36.558,00:24:37.976,Mallory! Mallory!
00:24:50.280,00:24:52.824,"-So now they have cars on the moon? -Oh, hush."
00:24:52.908,00:24:53.950,I'm here to help.
00:24:57.579,00:24:59.372,"Chan, now."
00:25:00.457,00:25:02.334,Command-shift-6.
00:25:05.504,00:25:06.922,On my signal!
00:25:07.339,00:25:08.256,Charge!
00:25:11.301,00:25:12.135,What the hell?
00:25:24.898,00:25:25.982,Have at it.
00:25:26.816,00:25:27.734,Thank you.
00:25:36.368,00:25:37.244,"Oh, no."
00:25:37.327,00:25:38.245,"Oh, my God."
00:25:39.079,00:25:40.664,"Don't you do it, Naird!"
00:25:42.791,00:25:43.750,Ha!
00:25:43.833,00:25:45.377,You're still an ass!
00:26:03.520,00:26:04.813,No more Red Team.
00:26:05.355,00:26:06.773,And the winner is Space Force!
00:26:06.856,00:26:08.358,-Space Force! -Yeah!
00:26:10.402,00:26:12.362,Yes! Yes!
00:26:12.904,00:26:14.114,In your face!
00:26:15.657,00:26:18.535,"Yeah, bitch! Uh!"
00:26:21.955,00:26:22.831,Uh-huh!
00:26:34.551,00:26:36.886,Everyone should be proud.
00:26:36.970,00:26:38.597,You acquitted yourselves well.
00:26:39.264,00:26:40.640,"We got ice cream, sir."
00:26:41.516,00:26:42.559,Enjoy it.
00:26:43.643,00:26:44.936,That goes for all of you.
00:26:45.020,00:26:46.605,Enjoy life while you can.
00:26:47.480,00:26:49.774,For only the dead have seen the end of war.
00:26:50.734,00:26:51.985,"We got sprinkles, sir."
00:26:52.444,00:26:53.445,Jesus.
00:26:55.822,00:26:57.198,Thanks for showing up today.
00:26:57.616,00:27:03.246,I hope this helps wash away some of those painful childhood memories of basketball in school.
00:27:05.707,00:27:08.793,I'm actually rather good at the shooting of baskets.
00:27:08.877,00:27:10.128,It's just physics.
00:27:15.717,00:27:17.427,Do meet me at the gym tomorrow.
00:27:17.719,00:27:19.179,I will destroy you.
00:00:17.058,00:00:18.101,What would I tell them?
00:00:18.184,00:00:26.818,"Well, I guess I would tell the readers of Stars and Stripes that defeating the Air Force in the first annual Space Flag Games felt great."
00:00:27.277,00:00:30.739,"We had a worthy adversary, but we were able to vanquish them."
00:00:31.740,00:00:32.574,"Oh, yeah."
00:00:33.116,00:00:37.579,"I hate to flex, but we dropped them faster than a Mark Ronson bass line."
00:00:39.456,00:00:40.707,Mm-hmm.
00:00:42.500,00:00:43.501,Yeah.
00:00:43.960,00:00:45.128,I don't know what that means.
00:00:45.462,00:00:47.172,You don't even need to write that down.
00:00:47.255,00:00:49.215,"Bottom line, we had a great win."
00:00:49.299,00:00:53.136,"And much of the credit goes to the person sitting to your right, Dr. Adrian Mallory."
00:00:53.553,00:00:56.056,"Tell me, what makes your relationship work?"
00:00:56.765,00:00:57.599,Trust.
00:00:57.682,00:00:58.975,And mutual respect.
00:01:00.560,00:01:01.853,Certainly trust.
00:01:02.395,00:01:04.647,"Oh, and that is our time. How fun was that?"
00:01:04.731,00:01:06.649,Thank you so much for this. And do you need a picture?
00:01:06.733,00:01:08.234,'Cause I can Photoshop it. Not a problem.
00:01:08.318,00:01:10.236,You want them on the Enterprise? I'll do it. Fine.
00:01:10.320,00:01:11.780,You want me to give this guy pointy ears?
00:01:21.581,00:01:23.416,"God, I hate him. I hate him so much."
00:01:24.209,00:01:25.251,I understand.
00:01:25.668,00:01:28.338,You seem unusually peppy today.
00:01:28.421,00:01:32.425,Did one of your favorite sporting teams succeed in their goals?
00:01:32.509,00:01:33.551,Can you keep a secret?
00:01:33.635,00:01:37.055,I have a conjugal visit with my wife today.
00:01:37.138,00:01:39.390,"Oh, my. When was the last one?"
00:01:39.474,00:01:43.353,"Well, this'll be the first time since she was sentenced six months ago."
00:01:43.853,00:01:46.981,POTUS approved it because of our big Space Flag win.
00:01:47.065,00:01:49.609,"So, in essence, I got you laid. You're welcome."
00:01:50.026,00:01:50.860,Don't be gross.
00:01:56.658,00:01:57.992,Your mother is still alive?
00:01:58.535,00:01:59.494,Yes.
00:01:59.577,00:02:00.537,Impressive.
00:02:00.620,00:02:04.999,"You know, a lot of centenarians are living long, healthy lives."
00:02:05.083,00:02:06.334,Probably due to better nutrition.
00:02:06.417,00:02:08.503,How old do you think I am?
00:02:08.586,00:02:09.462,Um...
00:02:09.546,00:02:10.380,Hmm.
00:02:20.890,00:02:22.058,What the hell?
00:02:22.392,00:02:23.226,India?
00:02:23.643,00:02:25.937,Can you zoom in on the exhaust mount?
00:02:28.273,00:02:29.232,Enhance!
00:02:31.025,00:02:31.943,Enhance!
00:02:32.235,00:02:34.320,That's not how it works in real life.
00:02:34.404,00:02:37.699,You can't create information from nothing.
00:02:43.037,00:02:45.790,That's a Pegasus fin system.
00:02:45.874,00:02:48.001,But we're the only ones with Pegasus.
00:02:48.084,00:02:49.085,I designed it.
00:02:49.169,00:02:50.920,"Don't be that way, Ranatunga."
00:02:52.297,00:02:53.381,What does this mean?
00:02:53.464,00:02:56.426,It could mean any number of things.
00:02:58.845,00:02:59.721,Ah.
00:03:00.513,00:03:01.514,Put it in a report.
00:03:01.598,00:03:03.683,I've got my appointment to get to.
00:03:03.933,00:03:07.770,"Yeah, that's right. Your appointment. Well, go get 'em, tiger. You earned it."
00:03:08.563,00:03:10.398,What kind of appointment is this?
00:03:10.481,00:03:11.649,-Dentist. -Dentist.
00:03:23.536,00:03:25.455,"Yes, so, tell me about your cable package..."
00:03:27.332,00:03:29.375,"Oh, you look nice, sir."
00:03:29.459,00:03:31.669,I used cream rinse.
00:03:32.337,00:03:33.588,"Is that, like, a conditioner?"
00:03:33.671,00:03:35.673,Yes. Same-- Same thing.
00:03:36.090,00:03:38.301,That's a very nice flower. It's a nice touch.
00:03:38.718,00:03:42.430,"If there's a more perfect flower than the rose, I've never seen it."
00:03:42.513,00:03:46.768,"So nice hair, nice flower, what are we talking about?"
00:03:46.851,00:03:47.852,Anniversary?
00:03:49.103,00:03:50.855,"Uh, no. Nope."
00:03:55.944,00:03:57.987,Have you ever heard the term conjugal visit?
00:03:59.906,00:04:01.324,"Uh, yes."
00:04:06.537,00:04:07.497,The forms.
00:04:07.580,00:04:11.251,"And all of it has to do with, Well, is it consensual?"
00:04:11.334,00:04:14.087,Of course it's consensual. This is my wife.
00:04:14.837,00:04:16.798,How long? How long do you want?
00:04:16.881,00:04:19.217,Fifteen-minute-- It's all 15-minute increments.
00:04:19.300,00:04:21.135,Are you kidding me? Fifteen minutes?
00:04:21.219,00:04:23.513,Who can do anything in 15 minutes?
00:04:23.596,00:04:26.474,We settled on 45 minutes. That should do the trick.
00:04:26.557,00:04:27.392,But...
00:04:38.695,00:04:42.490,"No, sir. That's-- It's all part of-- part of being a person."
00:04:44.701,00:04:45.535,Yeah.
00:04:46.536,00:04:50.873,I'd appreciate it if you could erase any images you now have in your mind.
00:04:53.126,00:04:53.960,Yep.
00:05:03.511,00:05:04.512,Thank you.
00:05:08.891,00:05:09.934,Oh.
00:05:24.657,00:05:25.825,You can't see her.
00:05:26.451,00:05:28.369,-What? -Came from the White House.
00:05:28.453,00:05:29.495,Check your phone.
00:05:50.892,00:05:52.477,"Wow, that was fast."
00:05:53.269,00:05:55.104,"-It was canceled. -Oh, no."
00:05:55.188,00:05:56.189,Here.
00:06:09.994,00:06:11.704,POTUS is furious. Let's go.
00:06:12.246,00:06:13.539,Me? Well...
00:06:13.623,00:06:16.167,"-I didn't do anything. -If I'm in trouble, you're in trouble."
00:06:18.961,00:06:20.880,How did India get the Pegasus?
00:06:23.424,00:06:27.136,"Because you got a goddamn spy over there, and you better find him ASAP!"
00:06:27.220,00:06:29.639,The president has a name for countries like India.
00:06:29.722,00:06:31.307,A name I can't repeat.
00:06:31.391,00:06:33.518,Jesus. The timing on this.
00:06:34.018,00:06:35.478,Timing? What do you mean?
00:06:35.561,00:06:39.482,It just comes on a very inauspicious day.
00:06:40.233,00:06:41.442,I'm not sure I follow.
00:06:42.235,00:06:44.320,"Oh, it's POTUS' birthday."
00:06:44.404,00:06:45.530,I didn't say that.
00:06:45.822,00:06:50.451,"But if I were you, I would be very aware of his desire to have this day feel special."
00:06:50.535,00:06:51.661,I completely understand.
00:06:51.744,00:06:53.996,Maybe we can launch something of our own to celebrate the day.
00:06:54.414,00:06:55.873,Do we have any missions ready to launch?
00:06:55.957,00:06:57.417,The climate orbiter.
00:06:57.500,00:06:59.836,-Not that. -Why not? It's ready to go.
00:06:59.919,00:07:01.254,You know why.
00:07:01.337,00:07:04.424,And find the goddamn spy before this thing hits the news cycle.
00:07:04.507,00:07:08.636,"We need to nail somebody's head to the wall on this thing, or else it's gonna be yours. Get it?"
00:07:08.719,00:07:13.891,"Given history, are we literally going to nail someone's head to a wall?"
00:07:13.975,00:07:14.809,Of course not.
00:07:14.892,00:07:17.019,"No, well, hold on now. We don't know that for sure."
00:07:17.103,00:07:20.565,"Let's just find the spy, and we'll talk about what comes next."
00:07:20.648,00:07:25.903,Since when has making the president happy on his birthday become part of our mission?
00:07:25.987,00:07:27.071,Tell me about it.
00:07:27.488,00:07:30.491,I feel like the party clown I hired on Erin's fifth birthday.
00:07:31.075,00:07:33.703,At least I let him go home with the rest of the cake.
00:07:34.203,00:07:36.914,"He looked hungry, tired..."
00:07:37.915,00:07:38.749,Hey!
00:07:38.833,00:07:40.918,Are you eavesdropping on a classified conversation?
00:07:41.002,00:07:43.629,Sorry. Earbuds. I didn't-- Earbuds. So...
00:07:52.847,00:07:55.933,Everybody leave. We need this space for a private meeting.
00:07:56.017,00:07:58.394,Take that sandwich with ya. Take it to go.
00:07:59.395,00:08:00.563,"You too, Hildy."
00:08:01.189,00:08:03.399,I will have an egg salad sandwich on your way out.
00:08:03.483,00:08:04.484,You want anything?
00:08:04.567,00:08:06.777,What are your impressions of the grilled cheese?
00:08:06.861,00:08:09.155,"Oh, my God. He's not hungry. Never mind."
00:08:09.238,00:08:10.239,Have a muffin.
00:08:11.407,00:08:12.867,"All right, let's make a list."
00:08:12.950,00:08:13.993,Who is the spy?
00:08:14.076,00:08:16.662,"Yuri, obviously. He's on Putin's payroll."
00:08:17.288,00:08:18.331,Yeah.
00:08:18.414,00:08:20.666,And Baxter. That guy gives me the creeps.
00:08:20.750,00:08:23.669,"Every time I'm anywhere near him, he hides his cell phone."
00:08:23.753,00:08:24.962,Mm-hmm. Uh...
00:08:25.046,00:08:26.047,Chan. Definitely.
00:08:26.506,00:08:28.424,Wait. Chan is my number two.
00:08:28.508,00:08:30.551,I consider him above suspicion.
00:08:30.635,00:08:32.762,"All right, so we've got Yuri, Baxter, Chan."
00:08:32.845,00:08:34.931,-Brad. -What? No way.
00:08:35.014,00:08:38.851,"Well, you come after my number two, I'm gonna come after your number two."
00:08:41.521,00:08:43.523,I send one of yours to the morgue.
00:08:43.606,00:08:44.899,What the fuck?
00:08:45.483,00:08:47.360,Were-- Were you doing Nixon?
00:08:47.985,00:08:49.862,What? No.
00:08:50.321,00:08:51.197,Who was it?
00:08:52.448,00:08:53.741,It was Sean Connery.
00:08:53.824,00:08:54.700,Ah.
00:08:55.117,00:08:57.537,My family's from Hong Kong. Why would I help India?
00:08:59.121,00:09:03.042,"China and India are both part of Asia, are they not?"
00:09:04.377,00:09:07.713,People can be very loyal to their continents.
00:09:09.257,00:09:11.676,I got nothing to hide. You can go look in my browser history.
00:09:11.759,00:09:14.345,Maybe you actually learn a thing or two about BWAM.
00:09:16.055,00:09:18.140,It stands for Black Women Asian Men.
00:09:18.224,00:09:23.437,"We're actually the least likely pairing statistically in American couples, yet we have the highest marriage rates."
00:09:23.521,00:09:27.483,"So when we find each other, it's actually a wonderful, wonderful-- Enough. Enough."
00:09:28.651,00:09:31.779,IT will do an invasive search of your electronic history.
00:09:31.862,00:09:34.407,Make no attempt to leave the country.
00:09:34.490,00:09:40.454,"And let me tell you something, mister, if we do not find this specialty porn, you are in a lot of trouble."
00:09:41.372,00:09:42.582,It's not porn.
00:09:43.583,00:09:44.458,It's love.
00:09:45.167,00:09:46.669,We will be the judge of that.
00:09:47.211,00:09:49.547,Can we go talk to your number two now?
00:09:50.840,00:09:51.716,Yeah.
00:09:52.717,00:09:55.052,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay."
00:09:55.136,00:09:57.555,"Brad, may I see you in my office, please?"
00:09:57.638,00:09:58.472,"Uh, sure."
00:09:59.682,00:10:00.558,"May I come in, sir?"
00:10:01.601,00:10:03.352,-I asked you to come in. -Ah.
00:10:04.270,00:10:05.438,What can I do for you?
00:10:05.896,00:10:07.815,"Uh, is your calendar up to date?"
00:10:10.443,00:10:11.402,"No, Brad. Nope."
00:10:14.822,00:10:17.325,Is it Erin? Do you need me to babysit or drive her somewhere?
00:10:17.408,00:10:18.909,"-To her friend's house. -Jesus, Brad."
00:10:18.993,00:10:20.494,You're a one-star general. Act like it.
00:10:20.578,00:10:21.954,-All right? -Okay.
00:10:25.625,00:10:27.543,"Brad, have a seat."
00:10:29.170,00:10:30.004,Okay.
00:10:32.590,00:10:37.803,"Brad, have you ever seen or done anything suspicious on base?"
00:10:40.598,00:10:42.767,Um... maybe.
00:10:44.560,00:10:45.728,I don't know. Uh...
00:10:48.147,00:10:49.148,Like what?
00:10:50.191,00:10:51.651,Your leg's jiggling.
00:10:54.445,00:10:58.240,"Perhaps you called someone, shared some information?"
00:11:00.284,00:11:01.285,Tony?
00:11:01.369,00:11:03.329,Mm. No. A country.
00:11:03.621,00:11:04.580,Oh.
00:11:06.540,00:11:07.625,England?
00:11:07.708,00:11:08.709,Close.
00:11:08.793,00:11:12.505,This country we're talking about was once ruled by England.
00:11:14.674,00:11:15.549,Us.
00:11:15.633,00:11:16.717,Us?
00:11:17.301,00:11:18.844,"-Us. -How would that work, Brad?"
00:11:18.928,00:11:21.347,I don't know. You said a country ruled by England.
00:11:21.430,00:11:22.973,"Yeah, it was once a colony."
00:11:24.392,00:11:26.352,But it's further east than us.
00:11:26.435,00:11:27.478,Okay. Don't encourage.
00:11:27.561,00:11:28.646,"Wow, this is, uh..."
00:11:29.647,00:11:31.524,Is it Can-- It's Canada.
00:11:34.819,00:11:35.986,"Yes, that's right."
00:11:36.070,00:11:38.531,"Oh, I did-- -Good. Well done, Brad. -Phew."
00:11:38.614,00:11:39.907,Thank you. We're done.
00:11:39.990,00:11:41.617,Oh! Okay.
00:11:42.410,00:11:44.578,"Well, if you change your mind about the Outback, let me know."
00:11:44.662,00:11:46.205,"No, no, no. We're fine. Thank you."
00:11:50.209,00:11:51.794,-Thank you. Well done. -All right. Very good then.
00:11:51.877,00:11:52.962,Thanks. That was fun.
00:11:54.004,00:11:57.049,He is not the spy.
00:11:59.218,00:12:02.638,"His eyes were empty, like a department store mannequin."
00:12:02.722,00:12:05.349,That man pulled me out of a burning F-16.
00:12:05.433,00:12:06.767,I knew it was something.
00:12:07.685,00:12:10.271,"General, you want me to make a reservation at The Bloomin' Onion?"
00:12:10.980,00:12:12.857,"That's a menu item at the Outback, Brad."
00:12:12.940,00:12:15.985,"Oh, I-- No wonder they were giving me a hard time."
00:12:20.197,00:12:21.657,Now it's all ringing a bell.
00:12:24.827,00:12:25.911,There's my guy.
00:12:29.957,00:12:32.710,"I can't make you molly, Tony. Go ask Dr. Chandreshekar."
00:12:32.793,00:12:33.878,That's not why I'm here.
00:12:33.961,00:12:35.171,"Dr. Chandreshekar, you said?"
00:12:35.254,00:12:37.757,That's the molly person? Doesn't matter. That's not why I'm here.
00:12:37.840,00:12:41.802,"It is POTUS's birthday, and he wants something special from Space Force."
00:12:41.886,00:12:43.053,Is this official business?
00:12:43.137,00:12:51.645,"Not exactly, but when we deliver something cool and spacey for the big guy's big day, you, my friend, will get the gratitude of a grateful president."
00:12:51.729,00:12:54.940,"Can you imagine how proud your parents would be over in, uh..."
00:12:55.024,00:12:55.983,Mongolia?
00:12:56.901,00:12:58.402,-Baltimore. -Baltimore.
00:12:58.486,00:13:00.362,That's insane. You have a Baltimore too?
00:13:02.156,00:13:04.325,"Okay, all right. Let's think of a gift. Together. As a team."
00:13:04.408,00:13:06.494,"Here we go. Uh, la, la, la..."
00:13:06.577,00:13:07.787,Do you have an invisibility cloak?
00:13:07.870,00:13:10.164,Absolutely. Everyone's wearing one but me.
00:13:11.874,00:13:13.042,-No. -Mm-hmm.
00:13:13.501,00:13:14.627,Fuck you.
00:13:14.710,00:13:15.669,That's not real.
00:13:16.212,00:13:18.506,That's not real. Let's think of something real together.
00:13:19.507,00:13:20.883,Let's think of something real together.
00:13:23.385,00:13:27.348,"Hello, Miss Erin Naird, if I recall correctly."
00:13:28.849,00:13:33.187,"You do recall correctly, even though we only met once."
00:13:33.896,00:13:35.022,Three weeks ago.
00:13:36.565,00:13:37.399,Stalker.
00:13:38.901,00:13:39.902,Um...
00:13:40.110,00:13:42.154,"Well, I can't deny you did make an impression."
00:13:42.238,00:13:43.155,Oh.
00:13:43.614,00:13:46.992,"I left a little footprint on the soft, Alabama soil of your brain."
00:13:49.620,00:13:51.038,Not exactly.
00:13:51.372,00:13:54.375,"Your accent says dumb state, and I was going alphabetically."
00:13:55.376,00:13:58.546,"So, can I offer you a little ack-eye?"
00:14:00.631,00:14:02.550,"Well, that's part of the reason why I'm here."
00:14:03.425,00:14:06.846,"Last time we spoke, I learned I might be saying that wrong."
00:14:06.929,00:14:08.305,No!
00:14:08.389,00:14:09.473,Fake news.
00:14:11.183,00:14:13.477,It is pronounced ah-sigh-ee.
00:14:15.229,00:14:16.647,Look at you.
00:14:17.106,00:14:20.234,"You practiced in the mirror, and you nailed it."
00:14:20.317,00:14:24.238,"For that, you have earned the sacred berry bowl."
00:14:25.155,00:14:28.033,Crowned with the Crunch of Capitan.
00:14:29.535,00:14:30.494,You remembered my order.
00:14:30.578,00:14:36.166,"Yes, Duncan, it's hard to forget the sight of a grown man ordering children's cereal as a dessert topping."
00:14:36.584,00:14:38.043,And you remembered my name.
00:14:40.129,00:14:44.216,"Well, we do try to make it special here at Meal Armstrong."
00:14:44.300,00:14:45.676,Formerly Orion's Melt.
00:14:45.759,00:14:47.845,Formerly Area Fifty Yum.
00:14:49.972,00:14:52.057,"Y'all come back and order some more, ya hear?"
00:14:59.565,00:15:01.525,"Yo. What's up, nerds? What do you want?"
00:15:02.902,00:15:04.695,"There, I knew it. He's doing something with his phone."
00:15:04.778,00:15:06.280,-Grab it! -Hey. Come on.
00:15:06.363,00:15:07.531,-Get it from him. -Wait.
00:15:07.615,00:15:09.658,Get his thumb on the screen.
00:15:09.742,00:15:12.536,Open the screen. Get his thumb down. Put his thumb on the screen.
00:15:13.954,00:15:14.788,"All right, good."
00:15:14.872,00:15:17.333,"Okay, let's see who you've been feeding information to."
00:15:17.416,00:15:19.668,"Prime Minister Modi, perhaps?"
00:15:19.752,00:15:21.128,Go to texts...
00:15:21.629,00:15:22.796,Kick Grabaston?
00:15:22.880,00:15:24.298,The Air Force? What the hell?
00:15:24.381,00:15:26.634,"-All right, those are confidential. -Not anymore."
00:15:27.718,00:15:32.932,Mark's wife had to go to maximum security prison just to escape her marriage?
00:15:33.807,00:15:36.226,"Actually, she committed a very serious crime."
00:15:36.310,00:15:38.187,"-Okay, can I have my phone back? -No, get away. Get away."
00:15:38.687,00:15:39.897,This is from Kick.
00:15:39.980,00:15:42.274,Mark is the appendix of Space Force.
00:15:42.358,00:15:43.442,Useless.
00:15:43.525,00:15:45.235,And one day it will explode.
00:15:45.319,00:15:50.699,You might wanna let your pen pal know the appendix is a safe house for good bacteria.
00:15:51.909,00:15:54.912,Let's see how it works when I text him back as you.
00:15:55.412,00:16:02.211,Naird is handling this India crisis brilliantly.
00:16:04.546,00:16:05.381,He's responding.
00:16:07.758,00:16:09.343,"Naird, is that you? Shit."
00:16:09.426,00:16:12.221,But he has to think it's written by Baxter.
00:16:12.304,00:16:13.639,So insult yourself.
00:16:13.722,00:16:16.642,-Insult myself? -Just-- Voice to text.
00:16:16.725,00:16:24.316,"Mark is a little chunk ball who looks like Uncle Fester with an ass so tight, he can make diamonds from the corn in his turds."
00:16:24.400,00:16:25.567,"-Jesus, Adrian. -Send."
00:16:25.651,00:16:26.652,-Well-- -Come on.
00:16:29.947,00:16:31.824,Yeah. No. You know what? Let's ram it home.
00:16:31.907,00:16:33.409,What did Chan say about you?
00:16:33.492,00:16:34.493,"Enough, enough, enough."
00:16:34.576,00:16:37.871,"So you're not spying for India, but you are spying for Kick."
00:16:38.038,00:16:39.832,And I don't know which one is worse.
00:16:40.040,00:16:42.167,I'm transferring you to Space Fence.
00:16:42.251,00:16:50.092,"Wait. Isn't that-- Yeah, yeah, it's a monitoring station on an island in the South Pacific, and, at high tide, it is mostly submerged."
00:16:50.175,00:16:53.387,"So I suggest that when you get down there, you take the top bunk."
00:16:55.014,00:16:56.515,I never did like Baxter.
00:16:56.598,00:16:59.518,He eats a burrito like he's slowly undressing it.
00:16:59.601,00:17:00.436,Oof.
00:17:00.519,00:17:02.354,-Who's next? -Gentlemen.
00:17:02.938,00:17:08.318,"General, let me say I am very sorry for canceled sex visit with your convict wife."
00:17:08.402,00:17:10.821,-How do you know about that? -From observation.
00:17:11.405,00:17:12.406,The way you walk.
00:17:15.659,00:17:16.785,you think I'm spy?
00:17:16.869,00:17:18.912,"The thought has crossed our minds, yeah."
00:17:21.915,00:17:25.627,"Please, my phone doesn't stop ringing."
00:17:26.128,00:17:30.007,"Like, Yuri, why does India have Pegasus and not Russia?"
00:17:30.090,00:17:31.133,What are we paying you for?
00:17:31.633,00:17:33.886,"Mr. President, Father, I am sorry."
00:17:33.969,00:17:34.970,You see?
00:17:35.054,00:17:37.139,"Our interests, the same."
00:17:37.222,00:17:38.599,Let Bobby help you.
00:17:38.932,00:17:41.727,You don't need an advanced degree to be FBI.
00:17:41.810,00:17:43.187,"Actually, you do."
00:17:43.270,00:17:45.272,Most of them are either lawyers or accountants.
00:17:45.355,00:17:48.859,It's amusing you consider those advanced degrees.
00:17:51.653,00:17:54.198,Do you have all the security cameras checked?
00:17:54.281,00:17:55.365,We have.
00:17:55.616,00:17:56.867,They weren't helpful.
00:17:56.950,00:18:00.579,Then ask yourself who installed them.
00:18:01.080,00:18:01.997,Huh?
00:18:04.208,00:18:06.543,"Civilian contractor, Kelly King."
00:18:08.337,00:18:09.379,He has a point.
00:18:09.463,00:18:10.631,-Kelly? -Maybe.
00:18:10.714,00:18:11.799,She's so nice.
00:18:11.882,00:18:14.259,I don't think it could be her.
00:18:15.928,00:18:18.680,-Yeah. -Kelly? Huh? Mmm.
00:18:18.764,00:18:20.724,Get your fuckin' feet off the table.
00:18:24.103,00:18:27.940,"Okay, to figure out what the president would want for his birthday, we have to think like him."
00:18:29.024,00:18:31.527,I'm the President. I implement new laws.
00:18:31.610,00:18:34.530,-And I appoint heads of federal agencies. -Holy shit. You're terrible at this.
00:18:34.613,00:18:35.989,"Okay, what about this?"
00:18:36.073,00:18:40.702,Is there some sort of liquid or serum that turns an old man into a young person?
00:18:40.786,00:18:43.664,What are stem cells? Blood of a young thing? Like a baby?
00:18:43.747,00:18:46.250,"Doesn't work that way, and it's morally questionable."
00:18:46.333,00:18:48.168,I'm not trying to say all the blood of a baby.
00:18:48.252,00:18:51.088,"Just, like, a little bit of blood from a lot of different babies."
00:18:51.171,00:18:54.800,"Nobody's using all of their blood, and I'm talking about the best babies."
00:18:55.467,00:18:58.345,"Okay, I'm not explaining it right, but you're not even giving me a chance."
00:18:58.428,00:19:01.098,"-Because it's horrible. -Okay, why don't you say something then?"
00:19:01.765,00:19:07.146,"I'm in the Oval Office. A bill comes to my desk, I pass it into law because that is my constitutional role."
00:19:07.229,00:19:08.689,"Fuck, I am bad at this."
00:19:08.772,00:19:10.440,It's insane to me that you have degrees in things.
00:19:32.713,00:19:38.760,"Yeah, I just happened to be in the neighborhood, investigating some treason, and I thought I'd stop by and say hello."
00:19:38.844,00:19:41.180,Oh. Uh.. okay. Hello.
00:19:41.263,00:19:42.139,Hello.
00:19:42.639,00:19:44.057,"Are-- Treason, did you say?"
00:19:44.141,00:19:46.226,Yeah. Yeah. Probably.
00:19:46.310,00:19:47.186,Little bit. Yep.
00:19:47.269,00:19:49.021,-Little bit of treason? -Perhaps.
00:19:51.440,00:19:53.192,We don't know. We'll see.
00:19:55.402,00:19:56.737,-Can't wait. -All right.
00:19:57.446,00:20:00.032,"In your video system, are there any blind spots?"
00:20:00.115,00:20:00.949,No.
00:20:01.033,00:20:04.995,Is there any way to physically photograph the Pegasus without being recorded?
00:20:05.078,00:20:10.334,No. Unless you had the password and access to the system to reset after.
00:20:10.417,00:20:12.669,-Does anybody have that? -Just you.
00:20:13.795,00:20:14.838,You set it up for me.
00:20:16.048,00:20:18.008,"-Well, yeah. -So you have it too."
00:20:18.592,00:20:20.177,"Okay, should I get a lawyer?"
00:20:26.350,00:20:28.477,"Uh, no. Okay."
00:20:42.366,00:20:44.368,-Okay. You're good. -Okay.
00:20:46.662,00:20:49.790,"Oh, some dipshit gave the Pegasus to India."
00:20:49.873,00:20:51.208,"Oh, motherfuckers."
00:20:51.291,00:20:53.210,-Yeah. -Sorry you're going through this.
00:20:53.293,00:20:56.213,"Well, maybe it's all for the best, you know?"
00:20:56.296,00:20:58.173,"Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to drop by."
00:20:58.257,00:20:59.841,"-Well, not for the best. -No. Right."
00:20:59.925,00:21:03.428,"I mean, it's a huge breach, so national security..."
00:21:03.512,00:21:05.597,"-Yeah. Treason, and... -Yes, it is."
00:21:05.681,00:21:08.141,"-All right. -I hope you find the person, so I..."
00:21:09.685,00:21:12.646,"-Bye-bye. -Stop by-- Oh, God."
00:21:14.731,00:21:16.108,We're getting nowhere.
00:21:16.191,00:21:18.902,Agreed. Maybe we should put a stop to it.
00:21:21.822,00:21:23.490,"-Who, me? -Hmm?"
00:21:23.615,00:21:30.747,Or him? What are-- Who-- What-- What are you saying?
00:21:31.498,00:21:33.166,"Oh, my God. I'll be right back."
00:21:34.751,00:21:38.422,-Why don't you just walk in the room? -It's about Dr. Mallory.
00:21:38.505,00:21:40.090,-What about him? -Act natural.
00:21:40.173,00:21:42.384,Like I just said something to make you laugh.
00:21:49.558,00:21:51.268,"-What are we doing? -I don't know, sir."
00:21:51.768,00:21:52.936,I spoke to Wolf in IT.
00:21:53.478,00:22:01.570,"Two hours ago, Mallory sent an email to a random EarthLink address with the message, Searching our computers here. Can't keep this on mine."
00:22:03.572,00:22:05.866,Attached to the email was a large video file.
00:22:05.949,00:22:06.908,Double encrypted.
00:22:06.992,00:22:08.535,What the hell do you think he's trying to hide?
00:22:08.618,00:22:09.828,I don't know. But laugh again.
00:22:11.997,00:22:13.498,"That is funny, sir."
00:22:13.582,00:22:14.750,Mm-hmm.
00:22:14.875,00:22:17.419,"Yeah. Yes, I made a joke. And that's funny."
00:22:17.502,00:22:18.920,Yes. You did.
00:22:19.796,00:22:20.672,All right.
00:22:21.256,00:22:22.382,-Sorry. -Yeah.
00:22:22.924,00:22:24.217,"Good joke, Brad."
00:22:25.344,00:22:26.887,Brad is so funny.
00:22:27.929,00:22:29.556,Is he really a general?
00:22:29.639,00:22:30.557,Yes.
00:22:33.226,00:22:36.021,Nothing. He was just talking about business cards.
00:22:38.190,00:22:40.192,"How's your snack? What is that, a pigeon?"
00:22:40.275,00:22:41.610,"No, it's Cornish game hen."
00:22:41.693,00:22:42.736,Ah.
00:22:45.030,00:22:46.073,Hildy make that for ya?
00:22:46.156,00:22:50.285,"I thought she only warmed it up, but I fear she may have cooked it herself."
00:22:50.369,00:22:51.286,Mmm.
00:22:51.661,00:22:52.621,Yeah.
00:22:54.456,00:22:55.916,"Yeah, food."
00:22:57.667,00:23:01.129,-What were we talking about just before? -Ending the investigation.
00:23:01.213,00:23:03.632,Right. You wanna end the investigation.
00:23:04.132,00:23:06.343,Because you don't think that there's really a spy.
00:23:06.426,00:23:08.261,"Actually, that thought has crossed my mind."
00:23:08.720,00:23:09.638,Okay.
00:23:09.721,00:23:10.555,All right.
00:23:11.348,00:23:12.391,Um...
00:23:13.016,00:23:14.393,"You know what? I, uh..."
00:23:15.936,00:23:18.897,I'm looking to send some encrypted emails. Do you know how to do that?
00:23:21.358,00:23:24.778,"I mean, in terms of internet security, I'm kind of all thumbs."
00:23:24.861,00:23:25.779,Yeah.
00:23:26.613,00:23:27.572,I believe you.
00:23:28.281,00:23:29.366,I trust you.
00:23:30.117,00:23:32.452,I trust you. I trust you when you say that.
00:23:32.953,00:23:35.372,Wait. Are you okay? You're acting very strange.
00:23:35.455,00:23:42.754,Am I? Yeah. Yeah. Strange. I-- Why did you send a double-encrypted email to an EarthLink address?
00:23:42.838,00:23:45.340,"Oh, God. No, Mark. Sorry."
00:23:45.424,00:23:47.843,"No, that has nothing to do with the investigation."
00:23:47.926,00:23:49.177,That's purely personal.
00:23:49.261,00:23:50.262,I promise.
00:23:50.345,00:23:52.222,So you have no problem giving me the code?
00:23:52.305,00:23:56.435,"Well, no, I wouldn't do that because, as I said, it's purely personal."
00:23:56.518,00:23:58.687,"-Well, you leave me no choice. Security. -Come on!"
00:23:59.646,00:24:01.440,You can't be serious.
00:24:01.523,00:24:02.607,"Oh, he's very serious."
00:24:02.691,00:24:04.317,"Security, seize him."
00:24:04.401,00:24:05.986,"No, no, no, don't seize him."
00:24:06.069,00:24:08.738,"Brad, since when are you giving orders? Just take him."
00:24:08.822,00:24:10.907,-Okay. Tase him! -Don't tase him.
00:24:10.991,00:24:13.076,"Sorry, sir. But it felt good."
00:24:13.493,00:24:14.411,Let's go.
00:24:15.662,00:24:16.830,"Oh, Jesus."
00:24:16.913,00:24:18.331,With this oaf?
00:24:18.415,00:24:19.958,Shit.
00:24:22.210,00:24:24.921,What is this? They said it was an emergency.
00:24:25.005,00:24:26.256,-That's right. -Mm-hmm.
00:24:26.590,00:24:34.514,Because you're on the line with F. Tony Scarapiducci with a birthday present for POTUS from Space Force.
00:24:34.598,00:24:36.725,Yeah? What? A missile? Rocket?
00:24:36.808,00:24:39.436,"Well, sure, a missile's loud. Rocket's bright."
00:24:39.519,00:24:40.562,But this?
00:24:42.189,00:24:45.442,This is ten trillion times louder and brighter.
00:24:48.528,00:24:49.446,It's a star.
00:24:50.906,00:24:53.909,That's right. We are officially naming a star after him.
00:24:59.456,00:25:00.665,"Hit him with it, Chan."
00:25:01.124,00:25:05.086,Fornax Zeta J160540 is a hypergiant.
00:25:05.170,00:25:11.885,"It has tremendous luminosities, and, for the next 20 billion years-- Oh, no, and this is what you wanna give POTUS on the day India whoops our ass?"
00:25:11.968,00:25:17.265,"You are on my shit list, Scarapiducci! And what's that other guy's na-- Whoo."
00:25:17.516,00:25:18.808,"-Nailed it, huh? -That was close."
00:25:18.892,00:25:19.976,He could see your face.
00:25:20.519,00:25:21.394,The entire time.
00:25:21.478,00:25:23.438,Why? Leaving does what?
00:25:23.522,00:25:25.106,It's over. The whole thing's over.
00:25:26.316,00:25:28.068,"Okay, we've decrypted the first layer."
00:25:28.151,00:25:29.027,Go ahead.
00:25:29.611,00:25:30.820,"Mark, don't do this."
00:25:30.904,00:25:32.697,Too late. You had your chance to come clean.
00:25:32.781,00:25:34.616,It's clearly a video file.
00:25:34.699,00:25:35.700,Play it.
00:25:35.784,00:25:38.036,"Mark, really, don't-- I said play it."
00:26:10.443,00:26:11.903,Please make it stop?
00:26:11.987,00:26:13.613,"No, no, no. Volume."
00:26:32.882,00:26:35.802,"Wait, weren't you watching him for, like, two years?"
00:26:35.885,00:26:37.762,That seems problematic.
00:26:37.846,00:26:40.098,I'm aware of the optics. Thanks.
00:27:04.706,00:27:07.751,Wow. Cramming didgeridoo into that bridge must have been difficult.
00:27:08.877,00:27:09.961,"Thanks, Brad."
00:27:10.045,00:27:12.088,"That's one lucky guy, Dr. Mallory."
00:27:53.338,00:27:55.298,"Happy Valentine's Day, Jerome."
00:27:59.636,00:28:02.013,"Okay, Mark, so now what?"
00:28:02.097,00:28:06.851,Would you like to shoot at my feet and I'll dance a bit?
00:28:06.935,00:28:16.361,"Or, you know what? I may have a diary from high school, and we could read that out in installments over the campus PA system."
00:28:21.825,00:28:25.161,May I remind you that everything you saw and heard today is highly classified.
00:28:25.245,00:28:27.664,So not a word to anyone. Thank you.
00:28:36.673,00:28:38.049,"I am so sorry, Adrian."
00:28:40.051,00:28:41.428,Am I free to go?
00:28:41.511,00:28:43.471,I did not mean to embarrass you.
00:28:43.555,00:28:45.515,Don't bother. Am I free to go?
00:28:45.598,00:28:46.474,Of course.
00:28:48.435,00:28:50.103,Relationships are very difficult.
00:28:50.186,00:28:51.104,I...
00:28:51.896,00:28:54.232,"No one's going to remember this, Adrian."
00:28:55.608,00:28:56.651,Hold on.
00:28:57.318,00:28:58.319,It's the Sec Def.
00:29:02.449,00:29:04.325,We are still in pursuit of the spy.
00:29:07.036,00:29:07.871,What?
00:29:12.041,00:29:14.085,So India was just...
00:29:14.169,00:29:15.044,Smarter.
00:29:15.795,00:29:16.629,It happens.
00:29:16.713,00:29:18.631,You guys better get your act together over there.
00:29:18.715,00:29:19.799,POTUS is pissed.
00:29:19.883,00:29:23.219,I'm going to his birthday party right now. Expect a nuke storm on Twitter.
00:29:26.097,00:29:27.182,Hey. Um...
00:29:29.100,00:29:32.479,Jerome was by far my favorite person in the lunar habitat.
00:29:32.562,00:29:33.605,He's a great guy.
00:29:37.734,00:29:40.695,I noticed you had a spark with that contractor.
00:29:40.904,00:29:41.780,Oh...
00:29:41.988,00:29:42.906,Kelly.
00:29:43.615,00:29:44.491,Yeah.
00:29:44.574,00:29:45.450,She's nice.
00:29:46.493,00:29:47.994,Guess we had a little connection.
00:29:50.789,00:29:52.415,"I am married, of course, so..."
00:29:53.041,00:29:55.376,I probably should never talk to her ever again.
00:29:59.881,00:30:02.091,Sorry you missed your dentist appointment.
00:30:02.175,00:30:03.092,Thanks.
00:30:04.010,00:30:05.220,I'll floss later.
00:30:08.306,00:30:09.224,Yeah.
00:30:20.985,00:30:23.446,"Okay, POTUS just tweeted. Here it comes. Here it comes."
00:30:23.905,00:30:26.616,Just got the best birthday present ever.
00:30:26.699,00:30:29.494,Giant hyper star officially named after me.
00:30:29.577,00:30:31.663,Brightest-known star in the galaxy.
00:30:31.746,00:30:33.164,Cannot be taken back.
00:30:33.248,00:30:34.999,It is officially registered.
00:30:35.083,00:30:39.379,"Thank you to my very loyal secretary of defense, whose idea it was."
00:30:40.672,00:30:41.673,He fucked us.
00:30:42.841,00:30:44.050,It's a gas giant.
00:30:44.551,00:30:49.389,"When it collapses on itself in 20 billion years, we'll have the last laugh."
00:30:52.100,00:30:53.101,"We did good, right?"
00:30:55.353,00:30:56.312,We did great.
00:31:01.401,00:31:03.319,"I'm lactose intolerant, but thank you."
00:31:11.369,00:31:13.788,Please leave your recorded message at the tone.
00:31:15.290,00:31:16.416,"Hey, hon."
00:31:16.499,00:31:19.127,Sorry we didn't get a chance to see each other today.
00:31:20.670,00:31:21.963,I just want to say...
00:31:46.738,00:31:47.822,"I love you, hon."
00:31:48.531,00:31:49.574,See you soon.
00:31:55.121,00:31:57.123,"Oh, God. I'm so horny."
00:00:19.602,00:00:21.813,These are the best in the nation.
00:00:21.896,00:00:27.360,Our top electrician prospect is a contractor working out of Chicago.
00:00:27.444,00:00:34.826,"He already has confidential security clearance, so that should save some-- I'm sorry. Are we interrupting your workout?"
00:00:34.909,00:00:36.870,Would you like us to come back when you're done?
00:00:36.953,00:00:39.706,"Okay, cranky, I can still do this while you talk."
00:00:39.789,00:00:51.634,"Well, if I'm cranky, it's because I'm running myself ragged trying to adapt a four-year program for moon habitation into something that's ready to launch three days from now."
00:00:51.718,00:00:52.761,China forced our hand.
00:00:52.844,00:00:56.931,"If we don't get up there before they fortify their base, they could keep us off the moon forever."
00:00:57.015,00:01:00.226,Sending construction workers into space.
00:01:00.310,00:01:01.811,What are we thinking?
00:01:01.895,00:01:08.777,"Either we teach astronauts trades that may take years to master, or we teach tradesmen to be passengers on a rocket bus."
00:01:12.614,00:01:15.033,"Do not barf in your helmet, or you will drown."
00:01:15.116,00:01:17.077,Chan gets it. Maybe we should let him handle this.
00:01:17.160,00:01:19.746,"Oh, no. Moon habitation is my life's work."
00:01:19.829,00:01:21.790,I just wanted to complain a bit.
00:01:21.873,00:01:23.917,"Well, what a delightful waste of time."
00:01:24.000,00:01:28.379,We have to make the selections today to stay on schedule.
00:01:28.463,00:01:30.965,Would you like to call the winners with me?
00:01:31.049,00:01:33.510,Uh... yeah. I can't.
00:01:33.593,00:01:35.053,I'm not gonna be around.
00:01:35.136,00:01:37.222,"Chan, could you pack this stuff up for me? Thank you."
00:01:42.268,00:01:43.144,How are you feeling?
00:01:43.853,00:01:46.064,I'm nervous. It's been a while.
00:01:46.147,00:01:49.484,Don't put too much pressure on the act itself.
00:01:49.567,00:01:52.195,Arousal is birthed in the brain.
00:01:52.737,00:01:55.573,I can't tell you how creepy it is to watch you say the word arousal.
00:01:56.157,00:01:57.450,"Just, all right, listen."
00:01:57.534,00:01:59.661,"I've, uh... got a cover story."
00:01:59.744,00:02:00.787,I'm going to Denver.
00:02:00.870,00:02:02.372,You're going to Denver?
00:02:04.249,00:02:05.875,I'm taking Captain Ali to the eye doctor.
00:02:05.959,00:02:06.793,"Okay, good!"
00:02:06.876,00:02:08.795,Just make sure her eyes are healed before the launch.
00:02:08.878,00:02:10.797,"Well, we should carpool, General. Save some gas."
00:02:10.880,00:02:12.257,No. No. No.
00:02:12.423,00:02:13.675,No. No.
00:02:14.092,00:02:16.678,"No, he's not going to-- No!"
00:02:16.761,00:02:18.721,-I don't want to carpool. -Why not?
00:02:23.351,00:02:26.563,I find your presence grating.
00:02:28.314,00:02:29.149,Oh.
00:02:30.066,00:02:32.777,Is it-- Did-- Huh.
00:02:33.027,00:02:33.945,I see.
00:02:34.612,00:02:35.989,"I appreciate the feedback, sir."
00:02:36.447,00:02:37.574,Oh...
00:02:44.080,00:02:46.332,-Do you think I hurt his feelings? -Yeah.
00:02:46.416,00:02:49.669,And I want you to include Fuck Tony in your final selection process.
00:02:51.087,00:02:53.506,"Have fun in Denver, sir. I've always wanted to go to Denver."
00:02:53.590,00:02:54.799,"Thanks, spaceman."
00:02:55.008,00:02:57.093,Why on earth would I do that?
00:02:57.177,00:03:00.513,"First time since 1972, we're gonna have Americans walking on the moon."
00:03:00.597,00:03:01.931,They're gonna be instant heroes.
00:03:02.015,00:03:03.516,We need our media consultant for that.
00:03:03.600,00:03:04.726,Fair enough.
00:03:04.809,00:03:06.311,"Have a good time in Denver, General."
00:03:06.394,00:03:09.189,Just know it may not be as great as you remember.
00:03:09.272,00:03:10.106,"Thank you, Hildy."
00:03:10.190,00:03:11.774,Expectations managed.
00:03:11.941,00:03:15.111,"Uh, people certainly seem invested in your fake trip."
00:03:15.195,00:03:18.573,They care about the old man because they know the old man cares about them.
00:03:18.656,00:03:20.909,"-Mm-hmm. -Any problems, Brad'll take care of them."
00:03:20.992,00:03:23.119,"General, if I may offer some advice."
00:03:23.995,00:03:26.122,Downtown Denver will always be there.
00:03:28.708,00:03:33.922,"That way, when you do go downtown, it will be that much more special."
00:03:34.005,00:03:35.423,Yes? Okay.
00:03:35.757,00:03:36.799,Happy travels.
00:03:38.551,00:03:41.095,I believe your code may have been cracked.
00:03:46.517,00:03:48.186,Yeah. No shit.
00:03:50.772,00:03:52.941,"Hey, Bug. I was just getting ready to take off."
00:03:53.024,00:03:54.442,Heard you're gonna see Mom today.
00:03:54.525,00:03:56.319,-Yeah. -I'm coming with you.
00:03:57.237,00:03:58.196,Uh...
00:03:58.655,00:04:01.574,I don't think that's a good idea.
00:04:02.033,00:04:03.034,Why not?
00:04:04.577,00:04:05.620,I don't know.
00:04:06.663,00:04:07.580,Okay.
00:04:10.166,00:04:11.042,Shit.
00:04:19.467,00:04:20.593,"Jesus, Dad, what?"
00:04:20.677,00:04:21.886,Nothing. Nothing.
00:04:31.646,00:04:34.607,"Okay, so we're looking for American heroes."
00:04:34.983,00:04:36.067,Let me be more clear.
00:04:36.150,00:04:38.778,We are looking for people who look like heroes.
00:04:38.861,00:04:39.821,No uggos.
00:04:39.904,00:04:43.449,"Well, Abraham Lincoln is a hero, and he was pretty unattractive."
00:04:43.533,00:04:45.243,You're insane. He was gorgeous.
00:04:45.326,00:04:47.078,He was a Frankenstein without the bolts.
00:04:47.161,00:04:50.123,"But, now, Gerald Ford... hochi mochi!"
00:04:51.958,00:04:53.668,-Yeah. -He was poured into that suit.
00:04:53.751,00:04:55.962,"All-American, University of Michigan football player."
00:04:58.172,00:05:00.591,"-All day. -I also agree, but we have work to do."
00:05:00.675,00:05:01.926,"Call the first one, Brad."
00:05:02.427,00:05:05.138,"-Hello? -Mr. Ely, congratulations."
00:05:05.221,00:05:11.269,"You have been selected for Project Mayflower, and we need you in Wild Horse, ASAP."
00:05:11.352,00:05:14.897,I see you're working near Sheppard Air Force Base.
00:05:14.981,00:05:18.026,We can have a plane ready in an hour. Will that work?
00:05:18.443,00:05:22.322,"Yeah, just need to hammer out the details of my contract first."
00:05:28.453,00:05:30.705,"Yeah, I'm gonna need something more."
00:05:32.248,00:05:33.166,A million dollars.
00:05:37.337,00:05:39.839,I don't get paid a million dollars.
00:05:40.882,00:05:45.887,"I mean, no government employee gets paid a million dollars, Mr. Ely."
00:05:45.970,00:05:50.308,No. I heard Coach Saban makes over seven million dollars a year.
00:05:51.059,00:05:53.269,"-Roll Tide! -Roll, Tide, roll!"
00:05:53.353,00:05:54.854,"Oh, you would be a 'Bama fan."
00:05:54.937,00:05:56.773,"-Oh, I'm so sorry for liking winners. -That's so perfect."
00:05:56.856,00:05:58.941,"-Quiet, please. -Okay."
00:05:59.317,00:06:04.655,"Sir, the United States of America is building a permanent colony on the moon."
00:06:04.739,00:06:07.658,We are answering the call of destiny.
00:06:07.742,00:06:11.412,You would jeopardize your part in this over money?
00:06:13.373,00:06:16.417,"You want me, I should be compensated."
00:06:16.918,00:06:19.170,"To be clear, I don't want you."
00:06:19.253,00:06:23.674,"You're an unfortunate necessity, like tipping or..."
00:06:23.883,00:06:25.301,colonoscopies.
00:06:33.059,00:06:33.976,Fuck you!
00:06:34.060,00:06:34.894,Fuck you!
00:06:34.977,00:06:36.479,Fuck you!
00:06:39.565,00:06:40.525,Fuck you.
00:06:40.900,00:06:42.610,Ah!
00:06:44.821,00:06:50.660,"By the way, there is no need Mark should be privy to the specifics of that conversation."
00:06:50.743,00:06:52.245,Are we all agreed?
00:07:04.549,00:07:05.425,Ugh!
00:07:05.508,00:07:07.343,-Okay. I don't wanna know. -All right.
00:07:41.002,00:07:41.961,Good choice.
00:07:42.712,00:07:43.713,You like K-Pop?
00:07:43.796,00:07:45.423,"Yeah. Hell, yeah."
00:07:45.506,00:07:49.343,"I mean, K-Pop kind of jacked their whole shit from black music, but it's okay."
00:07:49.427,00:07:52.180,"Actually, black people and Koreans have tons in common."
00:07:56.684,00:07:58.186,"You know I'm not Korean, right?"
00:07:58.644,00:07:59.645,Yeah. Okay.
00:07:59.729,00:08:01.272,-Don't get offended. -I'm not.
00:08:03.483,00:08:05.193,"Well, where did your people come from?"
00:08:05.276,00:08:06.194,I don't know.
00:08:07.153,00:08:11.657,"In third grade, I had to do a heritage report, and I just said, Congo?"
00:08:12.200,00:08:14.118,I had just seen the movie Congo.
00:08:15.536,00:08:18.498,"Sorry, I just have a thing about being mistaken for Korean."
00:08:18.915,00:08:21.375,All my Korean friends are hotheads.
00:08:21.459,00:08:24.045,One of 'em threw a fork at me in Marie Callender's.
00:08:24.128,00:08:25.254,Why?
00:08:25.338,00:08:26.589,I said something about his grandma.
00:08:26.672,00:08:27.590,Oof.
00:08:27.840,00:08:30.510,"Okay, so your ethnicity's actually just asshole."
00:08:31.636,00:08:33.262,"Grandma Kim was a bitch, though."
00:08:53.950,00:08:55.660,Except for the Speaker of the House.
00:08:57.620,00:08:58.746,Very different.
00:09:03.125,00:09:05.169,"Oh, look at you."
00:09:06.420,00:09:08.589,Wait a minute. Is that a knit tie?
00:09:08.673,00:09:09.632,Yeah.
00:09:09.715,00:09:12.218,Dr. Mallory thought that I could make it work.
00:09:12.760,00:09:13.886,"Well, I like it."
00:09:13.970,00:09:15.596,-Thanks. -Take it off.
00:09:19.141,00:09:23.104,"You know, I was thinking of how we could -maximize our time here together. -Uh-huh."
00:09:23.187,00:09:34.198,There's a strategy in basketball called a two-for-one in which the team tries to take a shot early in order to get the ball back so they can shoot again before time runs out.
00:09:34.282,00:09:36.742,"Oh. Oh, I like where your head is at."
00:09:36.826,00:09:37.994,-Yeah? -Okay.
00:09:42.498,00:09:43.791,-Okay. -Hmm?
00:09:43.958,00:09:45.084,What's the secret here?
00:09:45.167,00:09:46.919,-It's a zipper. That's it. -All right.
00:09:49.839,00:09:51.841,How does that thing work? Okay.
00:09:52.425,00:09:53.593,What are we doing here?
00:09:55.469,00:09:58.723,I wish I had my multi-tool. They took it when I walked in.
00:10:02.018,00:10:03.519,"Well, I'll buy you a new one."
00:10:03.603,00:10:08.941,"Yeah, no, it's just that-- No, it comes out of my commissary, and I'm almost at my limit for this month, so..."
00:10:09.025,00:10:10.443,-Okay. All right. -I have to be...
00:10:13.154,00:10:14.113,Mmm.
00:10:15.781,00:10:16.741,Mmm...
00:10:19.660,00:10:21.996,Are you doing something different with your upper lip?
00:10:22.079,00:10:22.913,No.
00:10:24.540,00:10:25.875,Uh... okay.
00:10:25.958,00:10:28.919,Just seems like it's a little more active.
00:10:30.004,00:10:31.172,-Hmm. -I don't know.
00:10:31.255,00:10:32.423,-It's the same. -You know what?
00:10:32.506,00:10:36.594,Let's not think about a two-for-one or a three-for-one or any of that stuff.
00:10:36.677,00:10:39.472,"-Mm-hmm. -Let's just, uh, practice, all right?"
00:10:39.555,00:10:41.057,-Okay. Yeah. -Okay.
00:10:41.766,00:10:42.642,All right.
00:10:44.602,00:10:46.646,Maybe we should see what happens if we...
00:10:46.729,00:10:48.898,All right. That might put us in the mood.
00:11:13.964,00:11:15.841,Yo! Erin!
00:11:21.430,00:11:22.682,How do you know my name?
00:11:23.766,00:11:26.602,Maggie's the only one who gets her beefcake helicoptered in.
00:11:27.019,00:11:28.479,Figured you must be her daughter.
00:11:29.271,00:11:31.440,"She say you're smart, but you don't look it."
00:11:36.529,00:11:37.655,Oh...
00:11:41.575,00:11:45.955,"You're not gonna, like, shiv my mom in the shower 'cause I was mean, are you?"
00:11:48.916,00:11:51.419,No. She'd probably put me out of the book club.
00:11:52.545,00:11:54.630,"-Let's go. -Wait, wait, wait! Wait."
00:11:54.880,00:11:55.715,Sorry.
00:11:56.048,00:11:57.174,"So, you know my mom?"
00:11:57.925,00:11:59.093,How's she doing in there?
00:12:00.094,00:12:02.972,This is my rec time. You wanna talk? Keep up.
00:12:06.934,00:12:07.893,Keep going.
00:12:09.019,00:12:10.396,"Yeah, just keep going straight."
00:12:10.855,00:12:12.273,Why are you're walking like a ninja?
00:12:12.356,00:12:14.608,"Okay, can you just, like, lead me, please?"
00:12:15.860,00:12:18.529,"-No, no, no, no. -Like, just-- I'm not comfortable with that."
00:12:18.612,00:12:20.990,Two adult acquaintances should not be holding hands.
00:12:21.198,00:12:24.285,"What? Why? Who are you trying to seem single for, huh?"
00:12:24.368,00:12:26.370,That guy? Ooh. He has cats.
00:12:27.788,00:12:29.540,"Since I can't see, my sense of smell is heightened."
00:12:29.623,00:12:30.458,Fine.
00:12:33.878,00:12:34.962,Hold on to my shirt.
00:12:35.379,00:12:36.839,-What? -Hold onto my shirt.
00:12:38.340,00:12:40.050,"No. No, this looks ridiculous."
00:12:40.134,00:12:41.385,How do you know? You can't see.
00:12:41.469,00:12:45.055,Because there's no version of a man leading a woman on a leash that looks cool.
00:12:46.932,00:12:49.393,I am! I just led you around a huge pile of spiders.
00:12:49.477,00:12:52.229,"-Oh! Why-- -Okay, I'm kidding. I'm kidding."
00:12:52.688,00:12:53.647,It's a joke.
00:12:53.731,00:12:55.149,"Oh, that was a joke."
00:12:55.524,00:12:59.612,"Oh, yeah, I get why it's funny. Right, because I can't see, and I'm trying to protect myself, and I can't."
00:12:59.695,00:13:01.614,"Yeah, that's very funny. You're very good at humor."
00:13:01.697,00:13:02.656,Thank you.
00:13:12.291,00:13:13.375,So how's work?
00:13:14.043,00:13:15.002,It's fine.
00:13:15.920,00:13:16.796,Really?
00:13:17.296,00:13:18.631,Yeah. Yeah.
00:13:19.089,00:13:20.800,"Rockets go up, rockets come down."
00:13:21.175,00:13:22.134,The usual.
00:13:25.137,00:13:26.555,"Oh, it was nothing."
00:13:26.639,00:13:27.765,It was just a blip.
00:13:28.641,00:13:30.726,Louise said the president was mad at you.
00:13:30.810,00:13:32.478,Mm. No. It was a blip.
00:13:36.273,00:13:37.525,How's your work?
00:13:37.983,00:13:39.109,"Oh, it's okay."
00:13:39.652,00:13:43.989,"Yeah. I mean, I don't see myself cutting eyeglass lenses forever."
00:13:44.698,00:13:49.620,But you cannot get a library job unless someone dies or gets beat really bad.
00:13:50.204,00:13:51.372,"Well, give it time."
00:13:53.457,00:13:55.709,"Yeah, Mark. Think I will give it time."
00:13:58.838,00:14:00.798,"Maggie, I didn't mean to make you upset."
00:14:03.342,00:14:06.178,So how's everything else going?
00:14:06.262,00:14:07.346,Um...
00:14:08.264,00:14:10.099,I'm playing a lot of clarinet.
00:14:10.182,00:14:12.059,I always thought you wanted to play the harp.
00:14:12.142,00:14:15.437,Yeah. They don't allow string instruments in here.
00:14:15.521,00:14:18.065,It's a suicide-murder thing.
00:14:18.148,00:14:23.070,"-Well... -Which is ridiculous, 'cause I could easily kill someone with a clarinet. You know?"
00:14:23.153,00:14:24.446,Blunt force trauma.
00:14:24.989,00:14:27.533,"Internal bleeding, or, smack, brain someone."
00:14:28.576,00:14:29.910,"Hey, I'm not gonna do it."
00:14:29.994,00:14:37.668,"I'm just saying, I mean, I could, given the opportunity and the right provocation, the right provocation."
00:14:37.751,00:14:40.421,"Well, I'm just... I'm glad you're learning an instrument."
00:14:46.802,00:14:48.178,-Brooks &amp; Dunn. -Ah.
00:14:48.345,00:14:49.930,"Uh... next candidate, please."
00:14:50.723,00:14:52.141,"Well, that was the last one."
00:14:52.224,00:14:55.644,And we still don't have an electrician or an HVAC specialist.
00:14:55.978,00:15:01.358,I didn't anticipate so many people losing their nerve at the last minute.
00:15:01.442,00:15:02.943,So you gotta improvise.
00:15:03.152,00:15:04.361,Launch what we got.
00:15:04.445,00:15:05.988,"It's jazz, baby!"
00:15:06.071,00:15:08.240,You seem like the type of guy who pretends to like jazz.
00:15:08.324,00:15:09.700,We can't improvise this.
00:15:09.783,00:15:19.043,"Failure in either of those systems could be catastrophic, and we don't have enough time to launch another nationwide search for more candidates."
00:15:19.126,00:15:21.211,I mean... this is a disaster!
00:15:21.712,00:15:24.006,-Yeah. -My career is ruined!
00:15:24.465,00:15:25.674,I'm kaput!
00:15:26.717,00:15:32.139,No! I spent years training for this very moment!
00:15:32.222,00:15:33.849,There has to be a way.
00:15:34.642,00:15:37.811,"Well, uh, I found an electrician nearby with five stars."
00:15:38.187,00:15:41.148,"Uh, he promises, shockingly good results."
00:15:42.483,00:15:43.776,"Don't be an idiot, Brad."
00:15:43.859,00:15:49.448,"Yeah, don't be foolish, Brad, because anyone can have five stars if they only have one or two reviews."
00:15:49.531,00:15:51.575,How many reviews does he have?
00:16:10.344,00:16:11.178,No.
00:16:14.056,00:16:15.641,There was like a fly in here.
00:16:16.308,00:16:17.601,-Oh. -You know?
00:16:31.991,00:16:33.033,Whoo.
00:16:36.620,00:16:39.415,"Well, this explains how the cops caught you."
00:16:39.498,00:16:41.125,How are you not tired?
00:16:41.583,00:16:43.544,Used to run track when we lived in DC.
00:16:43.627,00:16:44.712,Not anymore?
00:16:44.795,00:16:46.839,"Only when I go to prison, apparently."
00:16:48.132,00:16:50.134,"So, how are you and my mom friends?"
00:16:50.426,00:16:52.636,"Oh, everybody's friends with Maggie."
00:16:52.720,00:16:53.804,Or wants to be.
00:16:54.054,00:16:56.348,She runs the most exclusive book club in here.
00:16:57.057,00:16:57.891,Great.
00:16:58.183,00:17:01.520,My mom has more friends in prison than I do in the outside world.
00:17:01.603,00:17:02.563,Hmm.
00:17:02.646,00:17:07.151,"You wouldn't happen to have, like, a meth-head daughter I could grab brunch with sometime, would you?"
00:17:14.450,00:17:15.659,Ha-ha.
00:17:17.036,00:17:20.581,"Hey, remember our trip to Palo Duro Canyon?"
00:17:22.374,00:17:23.208,God.
00:17:23.917,00:17:27.004,"-Yeah, America's second-largest canyon? -Yeah."
00:17:27.087,00:17:30.049,"What, did we think the Grand Canyon would be too overwhelming?"
00:17:30.466,00:17:31.300,Stupid.
00:17:31.383,00:17:35.888,"All right, well, when you get out, we will go to the Grand Canyon."
00:17:37.097,00:17:38.307,In 40 years?
00:17:40.017,00:17:41.977,"Well, I... honey, I thought it might distract you."
00:17:42.061,00:17:44.646,"Well, I don't need to be distracted. I need to accept what is."
00:17:44.730,00:17:46.523,"Okay. Maggie, what's going on?"
00:17:46.607,00:17:47.566,Nothing.
00:17:50.569,00:17:51.528,"Oh, God."
00:17:52.071,00:17:53.614,I didn't want to do this till the end.
00:17:54.281,00:17:55.115,Do what?
00:17:56.575,00:17:57.409,Yeah.
00:17:58.118,00:18:01.455,"Um, I think we need to talk about our relationship."
00:18:02.206,00:18:03.082,Um...
00:18:03.832,00:18:06.585,I think-- I think we should have an open marriage.
00:18:11.131,00:18:19.515,"Open to the, the notion of us having relationships that are intimate with people that are accessible to us."
00:18:21.600,00:18:22.851,No.
00:18:22.935,00:18:24.478,No? Just like that?
00:18:24.561,00:18:25.562,Just like that.
00:18:25.646,00:18:26.939,You're being ridiculous.
00:18:27.439,00:18:28.398,Okay.
00:18:28.816,00:18:29.650,Let's see.
00:18:30.025,00:18:31.443,You have notes?
00:18:33.403,00:18:38.826,Leaders must always be open to suggestions that can improve the organization's vision.
00:18:40.619,00:18:47.000,Team members need to feel comfortable enough to think outside the box and share their thoughts...
00:18:47.084,00:18:47.918,This is stupid!
00:18:48.001,00:18:49.461,-...and ideas... -No.
00:18:49.545,00:18:53.090,...without fear of being shut down or discounted.
00:18:53.173,00:18:56.051,It is the hallmark of a trust-based team.
00:18:56.135,00:18:58.262,I'm not even in the Air Force anymore.
00:18:58.345,00:19:01.557,I'm gonna be in here for 40 years.
00:19:01.640,00:19:07.563,I would like to have a relationship with a human being without having to be dishonest.
00:19:07.646,00:19:10.274,"This is a woman's prison, Maggie. You're not gay."
00:19:10.357,00:19:11.316,No!
00:19:11.400,00:19:14.153,"But I'm not 100% straight, either."
00:19:14.820,00:19:15.863,You're bisexual?
00:19:15.946,00:19:17.030,It's complicated.
00:19:17.114,00:19:19.408,"Well, great. Lay it on me."
00:19:19.491,00:19:20.826,I can deal with complicated.
00:19:20.909,00:19:22.786,I talk to scientists all day long.
00:19:22.870,00:19:24.246,About their sexual needs?
00:19:24.872,00:19:26.665,I could. I choose not to.
00:19:27.457,00:19:28.458,"All right, Mark."
00:19:28.542,00:19:32.796,"Okay, this has nothing to do with how good we are when we're together."
00:19:33.046,00:19:38.343,This is about what happens when you leave here and go back to live your life.
00:19:41.388,00:19:43.390,"Well, then..."
00:19:45.517,00:19:47.644,why don't you just ask me for a divorce?
00:19:49.897,00:19:50.772,No!
00:19:53.233,00:19:54.735,No. Our marriage...
00:19:55.402,00:19:59.698,Our marriage is not just about sexual exclusivity.
00:20:00.699,00:20:03.160,It's... It's about love.
00:20:03.368,00:20:06.288,And honesty and support.
00:20:06.914,00:20:08.081,And Erin.
00:20:10.626,00:20:16.506,"It's a declaration to the whole world that we've got each other's backs, no matter what."
00:20:17.174,00:20:18.884,And I don't wanna lose that.
00:20:20.844,00:20:21.845,Do you?
00:20:32.689,00:20:33.607,Okay.
00:20:35.817,00:20:37.027,What are we doing?
00:20:38.237,00:20:39.613,We've been apart too long.
00:20:41.448,00:20:43.617,We've forgotten how good we are together.
00:20:45.827,00:20:48.330,"No. It's not about that, Mark."
00:20:49.665,00:20:51.792,"Oh, God. Okay. Well, that's unfair."
00:20:54.544,00:20:55.379,Hey.
00:20:56.088,00:20:56.964,Hmm.
00:20:57.297,00:20:58.298,I love you.
00:21:00.968,00:21:02.219,"I love you, too."
00:21:18.151,00:21:23.573,"If that zipper doesn't come straight down, I am bombing this place to dust."
00:21:28.120,00:21:32.749,"No. One is Fullmetal Alchemist, one is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood."
00:21:32.833,00:21:34.668,"-Two different shows. -Right, so one's a sequel."
00:21:34.751,00:21:35.585,"Okay, I got it."
00:21:35.669,00:21:36.628,No!
00:21:36.712,00:21:37.754,It's parallel!
00:21:37.838,00:21:39.923,"They're like, uh, alternate dimensions."
00:21:40.007,00:21:41.591,"What, like one of 'em's a dream?"
00:21:41.675,00:21:46.346,"Full Metal Alchemist came first, but it caught up to the manga, so they have to make up their own stuff."
00:21:48.515,00:21:50.851,"Okay, but which one has Batman?"
00:21:50.934,00:21:52.561,What are you talking about?
00:21:57.357,00:21:58.233,Oh.
00:22:00.736,00:22:05.198,"Do not mansplain anime to me, you rude, rude bitch."
00:22:05.282,00:22:06.825,I can't wait to get rid of you.
00:22:07.242,00:22:08.201,Really?
00:22:08.285,00:22:11.955,"Is that why we've taken, like, 20 right turns in a row?"
00:22:15.125,00:22:18.712,You have kidnapped a woman so you can yell at her about cartoons.
00:22:18.795,00:22:19.880,How dare you?
00:22:22.215,00:22:23.675,-Ooh. -That was great.
00:22:24.718,00:22:32.976,"Maybe not as great as, uh, New Year's Eve '99, but it's hard to top that Y2K combination of excitement and fear."
00:22:35.395,00:22:36.355,We're incredible.
00:22:36.438,00:22:38.190,-Yeah. -We're incredible together.
00:22:38.273,00:22:41.401,There's nothing in here that can compare to our history.
00:22:41.568,00:22:42.694,Definitely not.
00:22:43.445,00:22:44.529,So it's decided?
00:22:45.030,00:22:45.989,Close it up?
00:22:46.073,00:22:47.491,Close the marriage?
00:22:47.908,00:22:49.117,Post a sentry?
00:22:49.201,00:22:51.203,Trespassers will be shot on sight.
00:22:51.578,00:22:52.746,"Uh, no."
00:23:02.297,00:23:04.716,"Mags, I don't want this. I don't want the open thing."
00:23:04.800,00:23:09.888,"Are you really okay with being alone all year, except for eight hours?"
00:23:16.019,00:23:16.853,No.
00:23:18.230,00:23:19.439,Was that a pause?
00:23:19.523,00:23:21.691,"-No. No, it wasn't a pause. -Oh, come on!"
00:23:21.775,00:23:24.277,"I don't wanna date anybody else, Maggie. Just you."
00:23:24.361,00:23:25.404,Okay.
00:23:27.489,00:23:28.824,There someone you wanna date?
00:23:30.742,00:23:33.995,I think an open marriage could work for us.
00:23:35.163,00:23:38.542,The countdown on our conventional marriage started as soon as I got arrested.
00:23:39.000,00:23:41.586,"No, it didn't, because I would wait for you forever."
00:23:42.087,00:23:44.464,Because that is what I signed on for when we got married.
00:23:44.881,00:23:47.426,So both of us should suffer needlessly?
00:23:47.509,00:23:48.677,What's the value in that?
00:23:48.760,00:23:50.929,"Look, I don't mind suffering needlessly."
00:23:51.012,00:23:52.055,That's fine.
00:23:53.557,00:23:55.142,You would not be fine with that?
00:23:55.225,00:23:56.309,No!
00:23:57.686,00:24:04.359,"I'm not fine with having sex only twice a year, and that's only when the president allows it, by the way."
00:24:04.443,00:24:06.278,It's more than twice a year. It's two visits a year.
00:24:06.361,00:24:08.363,I can have sex with you three times each visit.
00:24:08.447,00:24:09.781,That's six times.
00:24:09.865,00:24:11.241,Maybe I could go for four.
00:24:13.243,00:24:14.703,"I could do three, though."
00:24:14.786,00:24:16.204,I'd definitely go for three.
00:24:19.332,00:24:20.917,"Oh, boy."
00:24:31.386,00:24:32.429,That's us.
00:24:33.263,00:24:34.848,I'll tell your mom you say hi.
00:24:37.309,00:24:38.518,Thanks for the workout.
00:24:39.019,00:24:43.023,That was actually the first run I've been on since I quit cross-country.
00:24:43.106,00:24:44.483,"Feels good, don't it?"
00:24:45.859,00:24:47.027,It's freedom.
00:24:50.530,00:24:51.490,Yeah.
00:24:52.991,00:24:53.825,Bye.
00:25:19.851,00:25:23.230,"Maggie, what kind of man breaks his own vows?"
00:25:24.231,00:25:26.733,You can't just change 'em after the fact. That's not how they work.
00:25:26.816,00:25:27.859,But why not?
00:25:28.401,00:25:32.989,"Why not? Growing up, there are other people telling us what's right and what's wrong."
00:25:33.073,00:25:34.991,"Well, we're the grow-ups now."
00:25:35.992,00:25:40.622,The whole point of being faithful is to avoid hurting the person you love.
00:25:41.331,00:25:45.752,"We love each other, but being faithful is hurting us."
00:25:48.338,00:25:52.509,You've been such a good man for so long.
00:25:54.553,00:25:56.471,You deserve to be happy.
00:25:59.683,00:26:00.642,So do you.
00:26:03.728,00:26:04.688,Thanks.
00:26:08.984,00:26:11.278,"I wanted Denver, and I got California."
00:26:15.282,00:26:30.589,"In three days' time, a rocket crewed by astronauts, members of the military, and a group of world-class tradespeople will take off from this base to build an American town on the moon."
00:26:31.631,00:26:34.467,We would like you both to be on that rocket.
00:26:34.843,00:26:36.219,Any questions?
00:26:37.721,00:26:39.639,Which moon are we going to?
00:26:41.141,00:26:43.184,The one you're familiar with.
00:26:43.602,00:26:45.812,How'd you get my number? I'm unlisted.
00:26:46.313,00:26:47.606,"Uh, Angie's List."
00:26:48.773,00:26:50.859,Are they serving dinner on the flight?
00:26:51.484,00:26:52.736,Meals will be provided.
00:26:54.529,00:26:55.947,"Meals will be provided, so..."
00:26:56.406,00:26:58.325,Are we expected to breed?
00:27:00.118,00:27:01.202,No.
00:27:03.872,00:27:04.998,Can I bring my cat?
00:27:05.832,00:27:07.334,Can she bring her cat?
00:27:07.417,00:27:08.418,-Come on. -No.
00:27:08.501,00:27:09.502,-Sorry. -No.
00:27:09.586,00:27:13.089,"If we are required to breed, do I have a choice?"
00:27:13.757,00:27:14.716,Is it her?
00:27:15.175,00:27:16.134,That's a great question.
00:27:16.217,00:27:18.803,"He's saying if they have to have sex, could it be her?"
00:27:18.887,00:27:21.097,-He could be into it. -I understood. Thank you.
00:27:21.640,00:27:26.019,"Uh, if it will be required, you will be given a choice, yes."
00:27:27.312,00:27:29.064,I get an hour for lunch.
00:27:29.522,00:27:30.523,Understood.
00:27:30.857,00:27:32.942,When is Christmas on the moon?
00:27:33.943,00:27:35.862,It's the usual time.
00:27:36.363,00:27:38.073,After Christmas Eve.
00:27:40.241,00:27:48.750,"Have you addressed the possible hazard of werewolves on the moon, in their prime environment?"
00:27:53.505,00:27:55.173,Is that in all directions?
00:28:13.358,00:28:14.192,So...
00:28:17.570,00:28:18.780,Whatever we want.
00:28:18.988,00:28:20.365,We make the rules.
00:28:21.741,00:28:23.702,Never made my own rules before.
00:28:24.661,00:28:25.620,Sounds like fun.
00:28:25.704,00:28:26.705,It is.
00:28:28.540,00:28:30.208,"Oh, shoot, I gotta get in line."
00:29:19.090,00:29:20.091,Dad!
00:29:20.383,00:29:21.551,What the fuck?
00:00:28.069,00:00:46.212,"And as we, as a nation, look to extend our reach to the moon and beyond, we find great comfort in the knowledge that this courageous team will lead us there along with the many, many engineers and scientists who stand behind them."
00:00:46.588,00:00:48.923,"Wonderful words, General. Wonderful words."
00:00:49.007,00:00:51.509,We have time for some questions. Anybody have any questions?
00:00:51.593,00:00:53.053,Glasses. The guy in the glasses.
00:00:53.511,00:00:57.015,Is it true most of you are not astronauts?
00:01:00.185,00:01:02.771,Becoming an astronaut is a little like losing your virginity.
00:01:02.854,00:01:05.148,You can't claim it until after it happens.
00:01:07.442,00:01:10.320,Not all who go into space will be astronauts.
00:01:10.403,00:01:13.323,Some will be asked to weld.
00:01:15.116,00:01:17.327,Unbelievable. What a great answer to a terrible question.
00:01:17.410,00:01:18.828,Thank you very much for ruining the moment.
00:01:18.912,00:01:21.206,You can sit down. Anybody else have a question?
00:01:21.289,00:01:23.249,"Anybody? Meredith, are you here?"
00:01:23.333,00:01:26.419,"Text me next time. Meredith, right here. Third row. Meredith, everybody. Yeah."
00:01:31.382,00:01:37.347,"How is it possible that you all are ready, and don't you feel you're being reckless with the lives of your novice crew?"
00:01:40.517,00:01:45.146,"And to your point, we are, in fact, years ahead of schedule."
00:01:45.230,00:01:53.154,You have to keep in mind that the talented tradespeople on our team have been working at the top of their profession for decades.
00:01:53.238,00:01:56.950,"So, in effect, they have been training for this their entire lives."
00:01:57.033,00:01:58.159,They just didn't know it.
00:01:58.243,00:01:59.077,Wow.
00:01:59.452,00:02:01.287,Really handled a terrible question very well.
00:02:01.371,00:02:02.747,Unbelievable. Thank you so much.
00:02:03.206,00:02:06.000,"Okay, I mean, I think we nailed it, but does anybody else have any questions?"
00:02:07.335,00:02:09.587,"Uh, okay, good. Thank you guys so much."
00:02:13.383,00:02:15.426,How you doing? Feeling confident?
00:02:15.510,00:02:20.056,My entire career will depend on what happens in the next 36 hours.
00:02:20.140,00:02:22.392,I'll never get a second chance at this.
00:02:22.475,00:02:25.603,"And-- And frankly, I'm feeling the weight of that."
00:02:25.687,00:02:27.730,"-I'm sure you are, as well. -I'll be fine."
00:02:27.814,00:02:29.190,"No. It won't be fine, Mark."
00:02:29.274,00:02:32.694,"If it doesn't go well, you'll certainly lose your position."
00:02:32.777,00:02:33.695,I'll land on my feet.
00:02:35.822,00:02:37.490,There are too many eyes on us.
00:02:37.574,00:02:38.700,Stop it. Stop it!
00:02:38.783,00:02:40.869,"I get it. Keep it together, Adrian."
00:02:40.952,00:02:42.245,All right? Just keep it together.
00:03:14.944,00:03:15.945,When you step out.
00:03:16.029,00:03:18.781,"The first woman on the moon. I mean, that's crazy."
00:03:20.742,00:03:23.161,I... I don't know. I'm just gonna do my job.
00:03:23.244,00:03:27.248,"All right. It's just that, when you start talking, a billion people are gonna be staring at your mouth."
00:03:30.335,00:03:33.171,"You know what? Just get dressed, or I'm gonna send you to space in your underwear."
00:03:33.254,00:03:34.130,"Yes, ma'am."
00:04:03.993,00:04:05.495,Verify actuators.
00:04:07.872,00:04:09.832,"-Good luck, spacemen. -Thank you, sir."
00:04:09.916,00:04:12.168,-I don't think I wanna go anymore. -Too late for that.
00:04:12.252,00:04:13.503,T-minus 45 seconds.
00:04:13.586,00:04:15.588,-I'm getting out. -Nope! No! Don't get out.
00:04:17.215,00:04:19.092,You guys are gonna have a great trip.
00:04:19.175,00:04:21.094,A really wonderful time. Enjoy.
00:04:21.177,00:04:22.428,You're gonna love the moon.
00:04:22.512,00:04:24.180,"If not, do we get our money back?"
00:04:24.264,00:04:26.683,Did you buy tickets from someone?
00:04:26.766,00:04:27.976,T-minus 30 seconds.
00:04:30.061,00:04:31.271,Do not take off your seatbelt.
00:04:31.354,00:04:32.689,I forgot about my bird!
00:04:32.772,00:04:34.440,"Oh, my God. I'll feed your bird."
00:04:34.524,00:04:36.109,What's your bird's name? I'll take care of it.
00:04:36.192,00:04:37.193,They're all gonna die.
00:04:43.992,00:04:45.785,-Abortion! -Nope! Not possible.
00:04:45.868,00:04:50.665,"Mark, an astronaut has the right Go for launch."
00:04:59.507,00:05:00.508,We have liftoff.
00:05:13.104,00:05:14.439,Coming up on bearing separation.
00:05:14.522,00:05:15.606,Approaching max q.
00:05:15.690,00:05:17.191,Side booster shut-down.
00:05:17.275,00:05:18.985,And... separation.
00:05:21.446,00:05:24.407,We have exited Earth's orbit and reached trajectory.
00:05:24.866,00:05:26.492,"Next stop, the moon."
00:05:31.080,00:05:31.998,Whoo!
00:05:55.521,00:05:56.898,Hey. Nice rocket.
00:05:56.981,00:05:58.733,"Ah. Went up good, right?"
00:05:59.150,00:06:00.151,Really high.
00:06:09.327,00:06:10.745,Are you gonna say something? Or...
00:06:10.828,00:06:12.455,-Mm. It's coming. -Okay.
00:06:12.538,00:06:13.373,Um...
00:06:15.249,00:06:17.668,Would you care to go to dinner with me tonight?
00:06:18.544,00:06:21.130,We could continue the conversation.
00:06:21.672,00:06:23.299,Perhaps add other topics.
00:06:23.966,00:06:26.177,"So it's a, uh, business dinner?"
00:06:26.260,00:06:27.553,This would be a date.
00:06:27.637,00:06:28.888,"Oh! Hey, ho!"
00:06:28.971,00:06:30.390,Okay. Yeah.
00:06:32.183,00:06:33.184,"Okay, good."
00:06:33.267,00:06:34.143,Great.
00:06:35.269,00:06:36.229,I...
00:06:37.313,00:06:40.650,would like to point out that I am wearing a wedding ring.
00:06:41.150,00:06:43.486,Okay. So now I know what we'll talk about.
00:06:43.569,00:06:45.238,I just want to be completely up-front with you.
00:06:45.321,00:06:47.657,I don't know if you're familiar with my situation.
00:06:48.449,00:06:50.785,My wife is incarcerated.
00:06:50.868,00:06:51.828,Yeah. People talk.
00:06:51.911,00:06:59.293,So I am in an awkward position right now where I am both married and available.
00:07:01.129,00:07:02.505,I understand if it's too much.
00:07:05.508,00:07:08.719,"I mean, I'm sorry for your wife, but good for me!"
00:07:08.803,00:07:10.471,"-No, I'm just kidding. That's weird. -Okay."
00:07:10.555,00:07:12.140,"-But cool. -Eight o'clock, then."
00:07:12.223,00:07:13.516,Okay. All right.
00:07:15.435,00:07:16.894,"Listen, uh..."
00:07:17.603,00:07:20.815,really I'm interested in mostly just companionship.
00:07:22.024,00:07:22.942,Okay.
00:07:23.734,00:07:28.156,"Like a friend thing? Or is it-- Well, initially, that's... that was my impetus for..."
00:07:29.615,00:07:31.284,"-Okay. All right. -All right, all right."
00:07:31.576,00:07:37.165,"But, I mean, if something else were to come of it, -whether it be emotional or physical... -Okay."
00:07:37.248,00:07:40.543,"-That sounded really creepy. I apologize. -No, I think I get it."
00:07:40.626,00:07:41.794,We'll see what happens.
00:07:41.878,00:07:42.712,-Okay. -Wing it.
00:07:42.795,00:07:44.464,-That sounds good. We'll wing it. -Okay.
00:07:44.547,00:07:45.923,I still love my wife.
00:07:46.007,00:07:46.924,What?
00:07:47.008,00:07:52.805,"She's, uh, obviously a part of my life, but for the next 40 to 60 years, not so much."
00:07:53.431,00:07:57.435,Okay. You know what we could do on the date is not talk so much about your wife.
00:07:57.518,00:07:59.979,"-That's a good idea. -Just, uh, something to noodle."
00:08:00.062,00:08:01.522,We won't talk about the wife...
00:08:01.772,00:08:03.566,"or sex, or anything."
00:08:04.192,00:08:05.943,-What? -Nope. Good night.
00:08:07.236,00:08:08.571,That went pretty well.
00:08:17.371,00:08:18.414,Erin!
00:08:18.498,00:08:19.415,"Hey, Dad."
00:08:19.499,00:08:21.167,"Hey, I didn't know you were running again."
00:08:21.459,00:08:22.668,"Uh, yeah. Wanna run with me?"
00:08:24.962,00:08:25.922,I'll slow down for you.
00:08:26.380,00:08:27.256,Ha.
00:08:33.638,00:08:34.764,You sound funny. Where are you?
00:08:34.847,00:08:36.474,I'm running. What's the emergency?
00:08:36.557,00:08:38.017,I always forget you have a watch phone.
00:08:38.100,00:08:40.019,"-That is so cool. -Brad, what's the emergency?"
00:08:40.102,00:08:42.104,"Oh, uh, it's bad, sir. It's the Chinese."
00:08:42.188,00:08:43.147,You better come in.
00:08:43.231,00:08:44.649,I... I gotta go.
00:08:45.149,00:08:46.067,Okay.
00:08:49.487,00:08:55.159,The Chinese just claimed the entire Sea of Tranquility crater as a territory of scientific research.
00:08:55.243,00:08:57.203,But no one can own part of the moon.
00:08:57.286,00:08:59.664,It violates the Outer Space Treaty.
00:08:59.747,00:09:02.750,"Technically they're not claiming to own it, just to study it."
00:09:02.833,00:09:04.835,"See, their research base is here."
00:09:05.419,00:09:08.839,We're supposed to land here and set up a habitat here.
00:09:09.298,00:09:10.508,About 100 miles away.
00:09:10.591,00:09:13.386,Hundred miles seems like plenty of privacy for their study.
00:09:13.469,00:09:15.846,We planned a very specific lunar landing site.
00:09:15.930,00:09:17.723,It would mess up our mission to alter it.
00:09:17.807,00:09:20.560,A fellow scientist would be loath to put our mission at risk.
00:09:20.643,00:09:23.187,We need to open a direct line to their research center.
00:09:23.271,00:09:24.480,Do you know anybody there?
00:09:24.564,00:09:26.065,Science is a brotherhood.
00:09:26.148,00:09:28.985,"Even if we don't know each other, we know each other."
00:09:29.986,00:09:34.115,"Dr. Zhang, this is Dr. Adrian Mallory."
00:09:34.198,00:09:40.788,"First of all, allow me to say that I am delighted to be speaking with you, colleague to colleague."
00:09:40.871,00:09:53.467,"And also that your study of the enzymes which enable the digestion of human hair, that was a game changer, and I have the greatest respect for Tsinghua University."
00:09:54.969,00:09:55.886,What's your name?
00:09:56.971,00:09:59.682,Dr. Adrian Mallory.
00:10:00.349,00:10:01.726,Like the duck?
00:10:01.809,00:10:02.643,No.
00:10:02.727,00:10:03.644,Uh...
00:10:03.853,00:10:09.066,Let me begin by congratulating you on your lunar success.
00:10:09.150,00:10:11.235,We are the first to live on the moon.
00:10:11.652,00:10:18.284,"Well, I'm not sure it matters so much who was first, but it was a great achievement for humanity nevertheless."
00:10:18.367,00:10:19.201,We are the first.
00:10:19.285,00:10:20.119,Uh-huh.
00:10:20.202,00:10:26.042,Did news of something called the Apollo missions reach you there in China?
00:10:26.542,00:10:27.585,Maybe that happened.
00:10:28.002,00:10:29.045,Maybe not.
00:10:29.462,00:10:31.714,We've also heard of the green screen.
00:10:32.757,00:10:34.967,But your astronauts slept in the capsule.
00:10:35.051,00:10:37.011,The Chinese live in a moon house.
00:10:37.094,00:10:37.928,So we are the first.
00:10:39.221,00:10:40.514,Yes. Um...
00:10:42.642,00:10:46.687,I'm calling you in the hopes of clearing something up.
00:10:46.771,00:11:05.414,"The media is reporting here that you made a statement, a declaration, which I'm sure was misinterpreted, mistranslated, but they seem to think that, on behalf of China, you laid a claim to the entire Sea of Tranquility."
00:11:05.498,00:11:06.957,You stay out. Thank you.
00:11:07.041,00:11:13.756,"But, Dr. Zhang, you understand that no country can own any part of the moon."
00:11:13.839,00:11:16.759,You can't make a claim to-- Not a claim.
00:11:17.051,00:11:20.721,We're simply occupying an area of scientific study.
00:11:20.805,00:11:22.473,We study the lunar temperature.
00:11:22.556,00:11:26.060,"And you landing to the crater, that will change the temperature."
00:11:27.395,00:11:29.313,Thank you. Stay away. Thank you.
00:11:34.610,00:11:36.779,"Mark, don't overreact."
00:11:36.862,00:11:38.656,I'll take this through the proper channels.
00:11:39.532,00:11:42.785,"In the meantime, we should probably look for an alternative landing site."
00:11:42.868,00:11:45.121,"But don't underreact, either."
00:11:45.204,00:11:47.498,I don't wanna start an international incident.
00:11:47.581,00:11:50.251,And we don't wanna jeopardize our mission.
00:11:50.334,00:11:55.339,"And, by the way, Thank you, stay out, thank you is not very fucking fraternal."
00:11:55.423,00:11:57.466,-A... Adrian. -General. General.
00:11:59.969,00:12:02.805,-reaches as far back as 1998... -What is it?
00:12:02.888,00:12:07.601,...when he was accused of starting a San Bruno County and state park brush fire.
00:12:07.685,00:12:11.480,We were okay with the plea deal 'cause we thought he'd get shot in Afghanistan.
00:12:11.564,00:12:13.232,But I don't mind him going to the moon.
00:12:13.315,00:12:14.900,I mind him coming back.
00:12:16.777,00:12:18.571,"What the fuck, Brad?"
00:12:18.654,00:12:19.905,-Why didn't you vet that guy? -What?
00:12:21.073,00:12:22.908,-Me? I don't know how to vet someone. -Ugh.
00:12:22.992,00:12:26.454,"It's easy, Brad. You just give the name to our head media manager."
00:12:26.746,00:12:28.247,"Isn't that right, Tony?"
00:12:30.666,00:12:31.584,Tony?
00:12:33.377,00:12:34.211,-Yeah? -Yeah.
00:12:35.671,00:12:37.339,-wants to talk to you. -Yeah. I'd love to talk to him.
00:12:37.423,00:12:38.716,-Look at me. -Right there.
00:12:42.428,00:12:44.054,-I'd like to see you outside. -Yeah. Of course.
00:12:44.138,00:12:46.891,-Somebody's gonna get vetted now. -I'll kill you. I'll fucking kill you.
00:12:46.974,00:12:48.768,Try it. I'll snap your neck like a twig.
00:12:51.896,00:12:54.398,What the fuck are you doing? I told you a million times.
00:12:54.482,00:12:55.733,Why didn't you vet him?
00:12:55.816,00:12:58.736,I told you a million times to vet him! And you didn't vet him!
00:12:58.819,00:13:00.279,Next time you're gonna do it!
00:13:02.072,00:13:05.117,All right. I need you guys to tell me all the dirt.
00:13:05.493,00:13:07.495,Anything terrible any of you might've done.
00:13:07.578,00:13:08.829,Who wants to go first?
00:13:11.665,00:13:13.417,Don't be scared. We're gonna find out anyway.
00:13:13.501,00:13:15.336,"Anybody, all right? Take it off like a Band-Aid."
00:13:15.419,00:13:16.712,"One, two, three. Somebody go."
00:13:19.465,00:13:21.842,Holy shit. You came out big from the start.
00:13:21.926,00:13:23.177,Has he killed anybody?
00:13:26.347,00:13:27.932,Okay. Okay.
00:13:28.015,00:13:31.560,I went to a Halloween party a few years ago as a film negative.
00:13:31.644,00:13:33.854,So... blackface?
00:13:35.105,00:13:37.441,A film negative. It was clever.
00:13:37.525,00:13:38.359,All right.
00:13:38.442,00:13:39.652,I went as Gandhi once.
00:13:39.735,00:13:41.779,That is not okay.
00:13:43.280,00:13:44.323,"No, it's not."
00:13:44.406,00:13:45.324,Okay.
00:13:45.407,00:13:47.493,I can't believe I even have to ask this question.
00:13:47.576,00:13:50.996,Has anybody masturbated in front of an unwilling employee?
00:13:52.790,00:13:54.416,Define masturbation.
00:13:54.500,00:13:55.501,I will not.
00:13:55.584,00:13:59.088,"Well, however you define it, I definitely did it."
00:13:59.171,00:14:00.214,"Oh, my God."
00:14:00.840,00:14:02.258,It is very delicate.
00:14:02.341,00:14:08.931,"Either we seem weak and let the Chinese have their way, or we risk pissing them off, and tensions could escalate."
00:14:09.014,00:14:11.600,Exactly. I need guidance from the administration.
00:14:12.309,00:14:13.185,Hmm.
00:14:13.644,00:14:16.313,Or... I'm not telling anyone about this.
00:14:16.397,00:14:18.232,You're not telling me about this.
00:14:18.315,00:14:19.233,We never spoke.
00:14:19.316,00:14:24.113,"You just handle it, and I'll write in my notes that we talked about you meeting a hooker in an airport bathroom."
00:14:24.196,00:14:25.865,"-What was her name again? -Hooker, sir?"
00:14:25.948,00:14:27.324,There was no hooker.
00:14:30.995,00:14:32.204,"Oh, God."
00:14:40.296,00:14:42.673,-Did you find an alternate landing spot? -No.
00:14:45.759,00:14:46.969,They do?
00:14:47.219,00:14:49.263,"Adrian, get some rest."
00:14:49.346,00:14:51.891,Take a bath. I'm gonna need you sharper than ever tomorrow.
00:14:51.974,00:14:57.521,"Well, I can't take a bath because, as I mentioned Monday, I am out of bath salts."
00:14:57.605,00:14:59.481,But nobody ever listens to me!
00:15:06.280,00:15:07.406,How is yours?
00:15:11.911,00:15:13.120,It's delicious. Yes.
00:15:19.960,00:15:21.629,What about the impact of people?
00:15:25.090,00:15:26.717,I just said that so loud.
00:15:36.352,00:15:38.646,So are you actually allowed to date me?
00:15:39.688,00:15:42.232,"Uh, that is the arrangement as it stands, yes."
00:15:42.316,00:15:45.194,"But, like, the military, they're cool with it?"
00:15:49.531,00:15:50.491,Mm-hmm.
00:15:53.327,00:15:56.288,Then why did we drive so far to go to dinner?
00:15:58.082,00:16:04.088,"'Cause, like, I'm actually open to seeing whatever happens next in this wacky..."
00:16:04.171,00:16:06.131,whatever we're doing. Um...
00:16:15.140,00:16:19.436,I don't want someone to tell my daughter about this before I get a chance to say something.
00:16:19.937,00:16:21.730,I feel like it should come from me.
00:16:22.898,00:16:23.732,Oh.
00:16:24.400,00:16:27.111,"Yeah, sure. No. My God, I totally understand."
00:16:27.194,00:16:28.112,I'm sorry.
00:16:28.195,00:16:30.489,"Oh, no, no, no. Thank you for getting it."
00:16:34.076,00:16:35.119,Well...
00:16:35.202,00:16:37.204,"Just tell her before we have sex, okay?"
00:16:40.040,00:16:42.126,-Yep. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay.
00:16:44.420,00:16:47.464,You don't tell me where to land. I tell you where to land.
00:16:47.548,00:16:50.426,"You don't know me. And no, fuck you. I don't know you."
00:16:51.010,00:16:51.927,What?
00:16:54.388,00:16:56.015,And your paper was...
00:16:56.098,00:17:01.395,"it was absolutely redundant crap, you nutsack."
00:17:01.478,00:17:04.106,Your data set was unreliable.
00:17:04.189,00:17:08.485,You confused me with the mallard? I will fuck you up.
00:17:09.069,00:17:17.369,"Anyway, you only got your position after your uncle was appointed to the National People's Congress."
00:17:17.453,00:17:19.913,Oh! Is that a coincidence?
00:17:20.247,00:17:21.540,I don't think so.
00:17:21.999,00:17:24.585,I will fuck you up.
00:17:24.960,00:17:27.880,I will fuck you up.
00:17:45.981,00:17:46.815,Go for Chan.
00:17:48.901,00:17:50.360,I wasn't sure if this was serious.
00:17:50.861,00:17:52.488,"Can you switch me to a private channel, please?"
00:17:53.113,00:17:53.989,Yeah.
00:18:00.579,00:18:01.789,"Uh, space is good."
00:18:01.872,00:18:09.088,"Listen, um, I think I was supposed to prepare some, like, awesome sentence for when I set foot on the moon."
00:18:09.588,00:18:12.341,A dozen people have set foot on the moon. They only ever remember Armstrong.
00:18:12.424,00:18:15.094,Yeah. I will be the first black person and the first woman.
00:18:15.177,00:18:16.887,I think people are gonna be paying attention.
00:18:16.970,00:18:18.097,Pressure.
00:18:18.180,00:18:19.473,Okay. What do you got?
00:18:19.556,00:18:20.390,Okay.
00:18:20.474,00:18:23.644,"I'm thinking, It's good to be back on the moon."
00:18:24.520,00:18:26.355,-It's good to be back on the moon? -Yeah.
00:18:26.438,00:18:28.649,That's terrible. Who are you even talking to?
00:18:28.732,00:18:29.983,Who's your audience here?
00:18:30.567,00:18:35.572,"Okay, how about, Ladies, if you want to lose a quick 60 pounds, go to the moon."
00:18:35.656,00:18:37.282,"Oh, thank you. Yes. You think that's better?"
00:18:37.366,00:18:38.325,"Well, it's physics."
00:18:38.408,00:18:39.326,It's sexist.
00:18:40.244,00:18:43.705,"Okay. How about, There goes the neighborhood."
00:18:43.789,00:18:45.666,"Oh, you're so dead when I get back."
00:18:46.333,00:18:48.460,"No, listen, everyone's just trying to tell me what to do."
00:18:48.544,00:18:53.924,"Like, my women's studies professor was like, You have to claim this for women. My mom said to thank Jesus and Dr. King."
00:18:54.007,00:18:56.301,"Even my ex texted me to shout, Go Broncos."
00:18:56.385,00:18:57.845,-Hmm. That's a good one. -No.
00:18:57.928,00:18:59.638,I'm the one who worked for this.
00:19:00.180,00:19:02.432,I like It's good to be back on the moon.
00:19:03.016,00:19:04.810,Why can't I say what I wanna say?
00:19:04.893,00:19:06.061,I respect that.
00:19:06.562,00:19:08.438,It's good to be back on the moon.
00:19:13.402,00:19:14.444,Thanks.
00:19:17.114,00:19:18.115,I think that's good.
00:19:18.198,00:19:19.533,Goodbye. I have moon business.
00:19:24.454,00:19:25.372,Morning.
00:19:25.455,00:19:26.498,"Morning, bug."
00:19:28.250,00:19:30.335,That's all the running you've been doing.
00:19:31.044,00:19:34.173,"Listen, I, uh, have a question for you."
00:19:41.722,00:19:42.681,What?
00:19:42.764,00:19:43.724,I don't know.
00:19:45.017,00:19:48.896,"Your mom and I, well, we have this forced separation."
00:19:48.979,00:19:50.522,"-We're not-- -Dad, no."
00:19:51.064,00:19:52.024,Ew.
00:19:52.733,00:19:53.650,You're married.
00:19:54.067,00:19:56.653,That's a terrible idea. Mom would be crushed.
00:19:56.737,00:19:58.864,-I don't know about that. -I do.
00:20:00.490,00:20:02.117,What are you even saying?
00:20:02.743,00:20:04.244,You and Mom have your visits.
00:20:04.328,00:20:06.705,"-Gross. Okay, that's plenty. -Mmm."
00:20:07.122,00:20:08.207,At your age?
00:20:08.290,00:20:10.542,When would you even date? There's no time!
00:20:10.626,00:20:12.252,You don't even have time to help me with homework.
00:20:15.881,00:20:17.549,So sorry. Just gotta get to work.
00:20:17.633,00:20:19.259,"Oh, hi, Erin."
00:20:20.219,00:20:21.470,Uh...
00:20:22.638,00:20:23.680,Okay.
00:20:24.097,00:20:25.849,"Erin, this is Kelly."
00:20:26.266,00:20:28.810,Kelly has a background as a structural engineer.
00:20:28.894,00:20:30.103,I can't believe you.
00:20:30.187,00:20:31.605,Honey. Hon. Hon.
00:20:37.611,00:20:40.030,-What about the Fra Mauro formation? -Asteroids.
00:20:42.574,00:20:45.118,The Sea of Serenity has the same protection as Tranquility.
00:20:45.202,00:20:46.745,Not in our current orbit.
00:20:46.828,00:20:48.413,-It would add days. -Right.
00:20:50.207,00:20:53.543,I have been up all night thinking about this.
00:20:53.627,00:20:55.545,We are being bullied.
00:20:55.963,00:20:57.130,Yeah. Possibly.
00:20:57.214,00:21:01.093,"No. Mark, this is about standing up for ourselves."
00:21:02.719,00:21:04.429,Here's a what if. Okay?
00:21:04.513,00:21:16.024,"What if your friend, who runs the Navy, were to move a carrier strike group or, no, two carrier strike groups, into the South China Sea?"
00:21:16.108,00:21:19.361,That would certainly be a very aggressive and provocative act.
00:21:19.444,00:21:20.862,But would it work?
00:21:20.946,00:21:23.949,"We are trying to de-escalate, not start a war."
00:21:30.872,00:21:37.963,"You recounted to me yourself that when the Air Force is at a loss of what to do, they drop a bomb."
00:21:38.380,00:21:40.841,So why can't we do that?
00:21:40.924,00:21:48.390,"Please, just walk me through how-- how this could work to our advantage if-- Okay. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on."
00:21:48.473,00:21:50.892,"Brad, see if you can get General Tsengjun up on the screen."
00:21:50.976,00:21:51.935,"-Yes, sir. -Great."
00:21:52.019,00:21:55.105,I met him a few years ago at an anti-proliferation conference.
00:21:55.188,00:21:56.023,He's a good man.
00:21:56.106,00:22:01.486,"Mark, you know that this kind of personal diplomacy yields no results."
00:22:01.570,00:22:04.406,Sometimes it's important that cooler heads prevail.
00:22:05.407,00:22:07.367,Hi. What is the country code for China?
00:22:07.451,00:22:08.869,Eighty-six!
00:22:09.328,00:22:11.621,I was so happy to hear you're running again.
00:22:13.457,00:22:14.541,Dad told you?
00:22:14.624,00:22:16.710,"No, uh, one of the girls mentioned it."
00:22:17.627,00:22:20.172,She kind of couldn't stop talking about you.
00:22:20.255,00:22:22.090,Even when I told her you're just in high school.
00:22:22.174,00:22:23.050,Oh.
00:22:23.467,00:22:24.968,I think that's why she's here.
00:22:25.385,00:22:26.595,Don't hang out with her.
00:22:28.055,00:22:33.310,"Mom, there's something you need to know, and it really shouldn't come from me, but there's no one else."
00:22:34.603,00:22:35.604,"So, uh..."
00:22:36.521,00:22:37.439,"Oh, God."
00:22:41.360,00:22:42.277,He is?
00:22:42.736,00:22:43.612,Yeah.
00:22:45.947,00:22:47.824,Do you like her? Is she nice to you?
00:22:51.787,00:22:52.662,What the shit?
00:22:52.746,00:22:54.331,"Okay, well, no one says that."
00:22:54.414,00:22:56.875,I just told you Dad's having an affair.
00:22:56.958,00:22:58.543,Yes. Okay.
00:22:58.752,00:23:02.172,"He said he wasn't gonna tell you, so I'm glad he changed his mind."
00:23:03.382,00:23:04.424,You knew?
00:23:04.508,00:23:05.801,It was my idea.
00:23:07.803,00:23:09.179,I'm seeing someone too.
00:23:10.639,00:23:11.807,Her name's Louise.
00:23:11.890,00:23:12.974,She makes me laugh.
00:23:20.107,00:23:21.024,Okay.
00:23:22.192,00:23:23.443,-Okay. -Honey?
00:23:25.112,00:23:26.530,"Well, now what did I do?"
00:23:28.949,00:23:30.909,"General, it has been a few years."
00:23:30.992,00:23:31.993,"Yes, it has."
00:23:32.452,00:23:33.286,How are your kids?
00:23:33.370,00:23:35.539,Just one kid. You know our policy.
00:23:35.622,00:23:37.666,"-Of course. -General, how can I help?"
00:23:37.749,00:23:41.628,"General, I was hoping to smooth over some of the friction between our moon bases."
00:23:41.711,00:23:43.255,This is how we should always do it.
00:23:44.548,00:23:45.924,I admire your initiative.
00:23:46.007,00:23:48.009,I admire your responsiveness.
00:23:49.553,00:23:51.096,"General, we would happily share Tranquility."
00:23:51.179,00:23:58.854,"-Bullshit. -It's just that our team already unloaded a lot of heavy equipment there, and then took the forklift apart and turned it into a rover."
00:23:59.271,00:24:00.105,Very clever.
00:24:00.188,00:24:04.860,"I am sorry, but we must ask that you respect the boundaries of our temperature experiment."
00:24:05.277,00:24:06.486,You understand.
00:24:06.570,00:24:07.612,Of course.
00:24:07.696,00:24:09.823,Let us keep an open line of communication.
00:24:09.906,00:24:11.283,"-Thank you, General. -Mmm."
00:24:11.867,00:24:14.536,"Well, you laid down like a hooker on quaaludes."
00:24:15.912,00:24:18.123,Who brings heavy equipment to the moon?
00:24:20.625,00:24:26.339,Bring up the images of the satellite's last pass over Tranquility.
00:24:31.386,00:24:33.013,That is an ugly habitat.
00:24:33.096,00:24:34.347,"-Oh, my God. -It's huge."
00:24:34.431,00:24:36.600,-Its footprint is ten times ours. -So gaudy.
00:24:36.683,00:24:38.727,"Okay, okay. What do you see there?"
00:24:39.144,00:24:42.147,"Well, lightweight construction materials."
00:24:42.230,00:24:45.400,And... why would they need a forklift?
00:24:45.484,00:24:46.693,Let's see a quarter-mile radius.
00:24:47.777,00:24:49.362,"Wait, back. No, back."
00:24:50.322,00:24:51.448,What is that?
00:24:53.658,00:24:54.784,Drilling equipment.
00:24:54.868,00:24:55.994,H-3?
00:24:56.495,00:24:59.498,Postulated to be in great supply there.
00:25:00.749,00:25:02.751,Helium-3. It's fusion without the nuclear reactor.
00:25:02.834,00:25:04.252,It's an unlimited source of energy.
00:25:04.336,00:25:06.838,Extremely valuable and easy to transport back to Earth.
00:25:06.922,00:25:11.676,One cargo hold full could power the United States for an entire year.
00:25:11.760,00:25:17.057,"General Tsengjun is not part of their space program, but he knew all about the temperature study."
00:25:17.140,00:25:21.937,"How many of our generals know anything about any of your studies, -including myself? -Zero."
00:25:22.020,00:25:24.189,-Zero. -Fucking sons of bitches.
00:25:24.272,00:25:28.276,"You can't hide a drilling station, you fucks!"
00:25:28.360,00:25:29.194,Okay.
00:25:31.404,00:25:33.782,"If we are setting down, we'll need to begin the approach."
00:25:33.865,00:25:35.450,"Oh, God."
00:25:35.742,00:25:36.993,What's the next best option?
00:25:37.077,00:25:38.453,Take out your balls.
00:25:38.537,00:25:40.080,Okay. You know what?
00:25:40.163,00:25:42.791,-This is a very delicate situation. -We have all these weapons.
00:25:42.874,00:25:44.209,-You need to relax. -Why don't we use them?
00:25:44.292,00:25:45.627,"-Sir! -You have to remain calm, Adrian."
00:25:45.710,00:25:48.046,Enough with the carrots. Let's use a stick.
00:25:49.923,00:25:51.341,-Never the stick. -Excuse me.
00:25:51.424,00:25:52.926,You're a fuckin' general.
00:25:53.009,00:25:54.094,Use the stick.
00:25:55.053,00:25:55.929,Bug.
00:25:56.930,00:25:58.056,What's going on?
00:25:58.515,00:26:03.061,"If you and Mom are just gonna disappear, then there's no us."
00:26:04.521,00:26:06.314,I'm completely on my own.
00:26:07.274,00:26:10.193,Why can't I count on just one thing in life?
00:26:10.277,00:26:11.820,"Honey, you can count on me."
00:26:11.903,00:26:13.655,Everyone counts on you.
00:26:14.364,00:26:16.449,And I'm always in the back of the line.
00:26:16.533,00:26:18.076,"No. No. Erin, listen."
00:26:18.660,00:26:26.710,"I have all of these scientists and astronauts, the whole Chinese government, and they're all waiting for me, right now, to make my next move."
00:26:26.793,00:26:30.130,But I don't care because I'm here with you.
00:26:30.422,00:26:31.339,Right now.
00:26:32.048,00:26:33.842,You will always be at the front of the line.
00:26:34.509,00:26:35.385,Yeah?
00:26:36.052,00:26:36.970,You bet.
00:26:40.515,00:26:42.142,What is-- What are you doing?
00:26:45.729,00:26:48.315,"Listen, hon. We'll talk about it later. Yeah?"
00:26:50.108,00:26:51.234,Forty seconds.
00:26:51.735,00:26:52.569,What?
00:26:52.652,00:26:56.281,I got 40 seconds with my father.
00:26:56.364,00:26:57.782,"Oh, honey. Come on."
00:27:01.286,00:27:02.537,"Language, Erin."
00:27:03.246,00:27:04.080,Erin.
00:27:07.834,00:27:09.210,I miss my dad.
00:27:31.149,00:27:35.236,"Space Force One, initiate landing sequence into the Sea of Tranquility."
00:27:36.112,00:27:37.572,Our spacemen come first.
00:27:38.740,00:27:40.575,Manual altitude control is good.
00:27:40.659,00:27:43.745,"Roger. Copy, Space Force One. You are go for landing."
00:27:46.706,00:27:47.666,Three thousand feet.
00:27:48.958,00:27:52.337,"Two thousand feet. Into the AGS, 47 degrees."
00:27:53.004,00:27:54.005,Three hundred fifty feet.
00:27:54.547,00:27:56.758,I thought we were stopping somewhere first.
00:27:56.841,00:27:58.385,-You're too tilted. -I'm not.
00:27:58.468,00:27:59.844,"Uh, you do seem tilted."
00:27:59.928,00:28:01.638,"-You are ordered to be quiet. -Yes, ma'am."
00:28:01.721,00:28:03.223,"There's a nice, flat spot right over there."
00:28:03.306,00:28:04.683,"-Ordered to be quiet. -Yes, sir."
00:28:04.766,00:28:07.894,"Sixty feet. Three and a half down, nine forward."
00:28:07.977,00:28:09.354,-Five percent. -I'm getting out.
00:28:09.437,00:28:10.355,Don't get out!
00:28:15.902,00:28:17.195,Engine stop.
00:28:17.278,00:28:19.739,Descent engine command override off.
00:28:20.824,00:28:23.243,"Wild Horse, Space Force One has landed."
00:28:23.493,00:28:25.078,We are now Habitat One.
00:28:37.966,00:28:40.468,Habitat One to begin stage one structure prep.
00:28:40.552,00:28:42.846,"-Eddie, please begin unloading. -Negative, Captain Ali."
00:28:43.346,00:28:45.181,-Sir? -You just had a long flight.
00:28:45.265,00:28:47.308,Maybe you should stretch your legs.
00:28:48.101,00:28:51.646,"Captain Ali, I think that you should go for a walk."
00:28:51.730,00:28:52.689,Uh...
00:28:52.939,00:28:54.774,"Outside? A moon walk, sir?"
00:28:57.485,00:28:58.695,Need me to say it twice?
00:28:58.778,00:29:00.321,"No. No, sir."
00:29:07.996,00:29:08.955,Okay.
00:30:26.366,00:30:28.326,It's good to be black on the moon.
00:30:29.702,00:30:30.703,"Oh, goddamnit."
00:30:32.956,00:30:34.415,Uh...
00:30:42.215,00:30:44.717,"Well, I guess we get to keep our jobs."
00:30:45.385,00:30:47.387,I fear I didn't keep it together.
00:30:47.470,00:30:48.388,Ah.
00:30:49.556,00:30:52.600,Did we really just do what we really just did?
00:30:54.185,00:30:55.270,We really did.
00:32:06.841,00:32:09.677,"If they were angry about something, they should've just called me."
00:00:21.062,00:00:23.815,That is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.
00:00:23.898,00:00:25.650,It's desecrating a sacred object.
00:00:25.734,00:00:28.570,Agreed. They just trampled over the American Koran.
00:00:28.653,00:00:31.489,"Isn't that breaking a US law, even on the moon?"
00:00:31.573,00:00:34.034,US law applies 200 miles from a US flag.
00:00:34.117,00:00:35.702,Two hundred miles from the coastline.
00:00:35.785,00:00:38.121,"Now, is the moon 200 miles away?"
00:00:38.204,00:00:40.957,"It is not, and running over a flag is not illegal."
00:00:41.041,00:00:42.208,"You're not a lawyer, Naird."
00:00:42.292,00:00:43.418,I'm a corporate lawyer.
00:00:43.501,00:00:46.087,They could argue that we abandoned that flag when we left the moon.
00:00:46.171,00:00:47.338,That would make it trash.
00:00:47.714,00:00:50.925,Take... that... back.
00:00:51.009,00:00:52.343,I just meant legally.
00:00:52.427,00:00:54.971,"Obviously, it's not trash. It's the soul of America."
00:00:55.055,00:00:57.515,"We should run over one of their flags, tit for tat."
00:00:57.599,00:00:59.726,Where we gonna find a Chinese flag on the moon?
00:01:00.268,00:01:01.519,Make one out of our own?
00:01:01.603,00:01:06.357,"You don't rip up an American flag to create a Chinese flag, you moron."
00:01:06.441,00:01:07.817,We need to hit back hard.
00:01:07.901,00:01:08.735,We can bomb.
00:01:08.818,00:01:10.403,"Big bomb, little bomb."
00:01:11.988,00:01:13.364,There's one for every occasion.
00:01:13.448,00:01:14.991,A flag is a symbol.
00:01:17.577,00:01:19.037,"If it were up to me, we'd invade."
00:01:19.120,00:01:25.126,I'm talking some serious Let's knock down the Great Wall they're so proud of.
00:01:25.210,00:01:27.087,We got all these weapons. We're never allowed to use them.
00:01:27.170,00:01:28.046,Drives me crazy.
00:01:28.129,00:01:30.757,"Yeah, I talk to my therapist about this all the time."
00:01:32.467,00:01:33.927,"No, no. We're not going to nuke China."
00:01:34.010,00:01:36.304,Could we get back on track here for a second?
00:01:36.387,00:01:38.473,Does anyone have a valid suggestion to make?
00:01:38.556,00:01:40.809,"We're just joking around, Grandma. Jeez!"
00:01:40.892,00:01:43.561,"Yeah, just blowing off steam there. Don't be such a pussy."
00:01:43.895,00:01:45.814,"Wait. What? No. No, no, no."
00:01:45.897,00:01:50.151,"We need to do one of these ideas, at least. Maybe more, right? Come on!"
00:01:50.235,00:01:53.404,"I mean, aren't you guys tired of everybody using us like a doormat?"
00:01:56.199,00:02:00.453,"Look, this happened in space, so the response must be in space as well."
00:02:00.537,00:02:03.456,-I have consulted a space attorney. -What the fuck?
00:02:03.540,00:02:06.376,-There's no such thing. You got scammed. -Now who's the dope?
00:02:06.459,00:02:09.337,We signed an international outer space treaty.
00:02:09.420,00:02:11.923,Any sort of violence and we break that treaty.
00:02:12.006,00:02:13.758,We must retaliate. I will handle it.
00:02:13.842,00:02:14.968,POTUS will be very happy.
00:02:15.051,00:02:17.428,We will do something significant and proportionate.
00:02:17.512,00:02:20.765,I don't think POTUS will be happy with a proportionate response.
00:02:21.599,00:02:25.228,"Well, then, it'll be a little more than proportionate."
00:02:25.311,00:02:31.484,I have taken it upon myself to have a focus group in which we can determine what would be an appropriate response.
00:02:31.901,00:02:34.779,"Ideally, what would you like to see happen on the moon? Anybody."
00:02:36.698,00:02:39.325,Research that benefits mankind.
00:02:39.784,00:02:41.578,Yeah. Okay. What about you? What about you?
00:02:45.248,00:02:46.374,Yeah. Yeah.
00:02:46.457,00:02:49.002,What would be an example of something bad that could happen on the moon?
00:02:49.085,00:02:50.503,Anybody wanna answer that?
00:02:51.504,00:02:55.300,An accident where a person gets hurt.
00:02:57.343,00:02:59.762,Could you ever imagine supporting a war on the moon?
00:03:01.264,00:03:02.599,That would be a terrible waste.
00:03:09.230,00:03:11.482,That's America! Keep watching. It's not over.
00:03:12.400,00:03:15.612,"Beep, beep, beep. Crunch."
00:03:16.070,00:03:17.071,Huh?
00:03:17.155,00:03:19.073,Does nobody respect us? Keep looking.
00:03:19.157,00:03:21.618,That is our country they're rolling all over.
00:03:22.702,00:03:24.495,"Yeah, we have to do something about that."
00:03:24.579,00:03:27.832,"I mean, maybe not a war, but we should definitely do something."
00:03:27.916,00:03:29.876,"I'm loving this. Okay, this is fantastic."
00:03:29.959,00:03:32.795,"Let's feel out this direction. Let's keep it going. Okay, what else?"
00:03:32.879,00:03:35.089,It should be retaliation on the same level.
00:03:35.173,00:03:38.134,"Like, it should be a prank. It should be like... graffiti!"
00:03:38.218,00:03:40.220,"Graffiti? All right, keep going. That's not bad."
00:03:40.303,00:03:41.679,Um... ding-dong ditch.
00:03:42.055,00:03:45.266,"Brown paper bag on fire, but there's poop in it."
00:03:47.602,00:03:49.437,"-I don't know whose poop. -Right, okay."
00:03:49.520,00:03:52.148,-TP their rocket! -TP their rocket!
00:03:52.232,00:03:53.149,I love this.
00:03:53.233,00:03:56.110,"That's what it takes, a 100-year-old white man to make this work!"
00:03:56.194,00:03:59.030,"Okay, let's pop it on the board. Here we go!"
00:04:32.814,00:04:34.691,How can there be no hammers?
00:04:34.774,00:04:36.442,We must have packed hammers.
00:04:36.526,00:04:40.238,No. None of the big doctor brains packed a hammer.
00:04:40.321,00:04:43.783,There are wrenches. Then use a wrench as a hammer.
00:04:43.866,00:04:46.536,That's not how you take care of your wrenches!
00:04:46.619,00:04:52.166,"No toothbrushes or deodorant either, but there are ten years' worth of tampons, for some reason."
00:04:52.250,00:04:55.753,"Wait. Young man, what are you using as a shovel?"
00:04:56.296,00:04:58.715,"Sir, it's actually Spaceman Obie Hanrahan, sir!"
00:04:58.798,00:05:03.594,"And I'm using a metal moon scoop with an adjustable crescent-shaped head, sir!"
00:05:05.888,00:05:07.849,"Hey, what's that hissing noise?"
00:05:07.932,00:05:09.017,Jesus-- Uh...
00:05:09.100,00:05:12.562,"you have to patch that up immediately, or you'll all die."
00:05:12.645,00:05:15.106,The-- The duct tape's in locker 1.
00:05:15.189,00:05:18.943,"Dr. Mallory, the Chinese Space Agency just posted some video of their base."
00:05:20.570,00:05:23.031,-Wow. -Put it on the big screen.
00:05:29.412,00:05:31.372,How many pillows do you need?
00:05:31.456,00:05:33.291,It's already one-sixth gravity.
00:05:39.505,00:05:40.965,Are you drunk right now?
00:05:43.259,00:05:44.677,Fine. You're fired.
00:05:45.011,00:05:46.179,Should I tell your dad?
00:05:48.681,00:05:49.766,Tell him.
00:05:49.849,00:05:52.602,He doesn't have a fucking leg to stand on.
00:06:00.902,00:06:04.030,"Okay, this is what I learned, and I think you're gonna go crazy for this."
00:06:04.113,00:06:08.451,"There are three cans of shaving cream on that moon base, and there's two cans of hairspray."
00:06:08.534,00:06:12.121,"If we just switch those nozzles, we can cause some serious mischief."
00:06:12.205,00:06:14.415,It's not enough. They trampled our flag.
00:06:14.499,00:06:15.541,What else you got?
00:06:15.625,00:06:19.962,"Okay, your eyebrows tested poorly in men and women ages six to 45."
00:06:20.046,00:06:21.464,Why are you testing my eyebrows?
00:06:21.547,00:06:22.423,It was unsolicited.
00:06:22.507,00:06:24.050,People just want to talk about your eyebrows.
00:06:24.133,00:06:26.010,The joint chiefs are on the phone in the conference room.
00:06:29.305,00:06:30.473,"How's it going, General?"
00:06:30.556,00:06:35.019,Every news outlet on the planet is showing some Chinese rover doing donuts on our most sacred...
00:06:35.561,00:06:36.562,cloth.
00:06:37.021,00:06:39.107,We need a quick military response.
00:06:40.733,00:06:41.567,-Hooyah! -Hooyah!
00:06:41.651,00:06:43.236,Booyah!
00:06:43.319,00:06:45.446,You have the go-ahead to attack the Chinese base.
00:06:45.530,00:06:46.489,How do you wanna do it?
00:06:46.572,00:06:50.743,Our lead suggestion from the focus group would be to shaving-cream the shit out of them.
00:06:51.327,00:06:56.416,"And if that's not enough, we also have the capability to TP as well."
00:06:56.499,00:06:59.710,And possibly graffiti the side of their base with China sucks.
00:07:00.920,00:07:01.754,Sound good?
00:07:01.838,00:07:04.006,"-Oora-- -No! No, no, no."
00:07:04.090,00:07:06.509,We need to burn that Chinese base to the ground.
00:07:06.592,00:07:08.469,I thought that's why you brought an arsonist!
00:07:10.263,00:07:13.307,"Well, not really, obviously."
00:07:13.391,00:07:15.685,"Yes, really, obviously!"
00:07:15.768,00:07:21.441,This-- This has been debated in the policy circles as high up in the administration as you can think!
00:07:21.524,00:07:22.692,It's time to stand tough!
00:07:25.361,00:07:29.407,"Look, nobody wants to get back at these commie bastards more than I do, but..."
00:07:29.824,00:07:38.499,"breaking a treaty with a reprisal attack of unwarranted destruction, and putting noncombatant scientists in harm's way..."
00:07:38.875,00:07:40.001,Mmm...
00:07:40.084,00:07:42.420,That's like three violations of the Geneva Convention.
00:07:42.503,00:07:43.838,"Okay, look."
00:07:43.921,00:07:48.718,"I'm not a professional politician, but this European International Treaty, come on!"
00:07:48.801,00:07:52.513,"Don't get captured like a bunch of losers, and you don't have to worry about how they treat you."
00:07:53.014,00:07:56.184,How about we just continue to look for some more creative solutions?
00:07:56.267,00:08:02.064,"Yeah, well, I think destroying the base is lame, and it's a war crime, uh, which you should never ever do."
00:08:02.148,00:08:03.149,"-All right, look! -Uh, okay."
00:08:05.193,00:08:14.994,"I need a complete outline and strategy for this battle plan to destroy this Chinese base, and I need it shock, I need awe, and I need it in PDF, 'cause my computer doesn't have Word."
00:08:18.706,00:08:19.624,God.
00:08:22.543,00:08:24.629,So that is the order from the top.
00:08:25.338,00:08:26.839,You can't do that.
00:08:30.718,00:08:32.595,I have to. It's the chain of command.
00:08:32.678,00:08:37.517,"Mark, they just named the flat area where we landed The Plains of Mallory."
00:08:37.600,00:08:40.561,"Oh, that is so cool. Congrats."
00:08:45.566,00:08:47.902,I don't want to read that in a textbook.
00:08:47.985,00:08:49.487,"Yeah, nobody wants that."
00:08:50.488,00:08:52.490,I'm sure cooler heads will prevail.
00:08:52.573,00:08:53.824,Just some saber-rattling.
00:08:54.909,00:08:58.079,"The next resupply can't launch for a month, so..."
00:08:58.829,00:09:02.833,"hopefully, they'll have the time to cool off before the guns show up."
00:09:04.210,00:09:05.044,Yeah.
00:09:20.935,00:09:22.144,It says spare oxygen.
00:09:22.228,00:09:23.145,Just open it.
00:09:34.949,00:09:36.450,"What do you want us to do with these, General?"
00:09:36.534,00:09:37.535,I'm not sure yet.
00:09:37.952,00:09:40.413,"Just, uh, show everyone how to use them."
00:09:41.080,00:09:42.665,Make sure they're cleaned and loaded.
00:09:43.708,00:09:44.625,"Yes, sir."
00:09:45.876,00:09:47.795,Loading and cleaning guns.
00:09:48.212,00:09:52.883,"Feels like no matter what I start doing, I always end up loading and cleaning guns."
00:09:53.217,00:09:55.803,I haven't been allowed to touch one of these in forever.
00:10:01.017,00:10:03.060,No. They're a research center.
00:10:03.603,00:10:04.645,So are we.
00:10:11.235,00:10:14.614,"No toothbrushes, but room for guns?"
00:10:14.697,00:10:16.449,"You lied to me, Naird!"
00:10:16.532,00:10:18.117,"General Naird, Chief Scientist!"
00:10:18.618,00:10:20.036,They were for self-defense.
00:10:20.119,00:10:21.370,"Oh, sure they were!"
00:10:21.454,00:10:24.999,"Sometimes, provocation requires a show of force!"
00:10:25.082,00:10:28.461,"Neville Chamberlain didn't do that, and Hitler invaded Poland!"
00:10:28.544,00:10:31.255,Not everything is World War II!
00:10:31.339,00:10:33.507,"Well, not everything is Vietnam!"
00:10:33.591,00:10:38.554,"I thought you were one of the good guys, with your John Wayne swagger."
00:10:40.598,00:10:42.516,You are Wayne John!
00:10:45.811,00:10:46.979,Wayne John!
00:10:47.438,00:10:48.939,I worked with him at IBM!
00:10:49.023,00:10:50.900,He stole pencils!
00:10:50.983,00:10:52.360,My pencils!
00:10:52.443,00:10:55.404,"If you had any integrity at all, you would quit!"
00:10:55.488,00:10:58.658,The person in line behind me will be even worse!
00:10:58.741,00:11:02.536,"I know I'm not perfect, but I know I'm not the worst."
00:11:02.620,00:11:05.956,"Well, you take that up with your next chief scientist."
00:11:06.040,00:11:07.875,-I quit! -Adrian!
00:11:07.958,00:11:08.876,Adrian!
00:11:10.294,00:11:11.337,Adrian!
00:11:16.801,00:11:17.802,Right?
00:11:39.990,00:11:42.535,"Whoa. What up, stalker?"
00:11:43.077,00:11:45.705,"Just sitting there all creepy, staring at me."
00:11:46.956,00:11:48.624,"How long have you been watching me, huh?"
00:11:51.127,00:11:53.295,Do you want me to be watching you?
00:11:58.551,00:12:00.636,"Well, that's not the story your heart rate is telling."
00:12:02.972,00:12:04.557,I'm going into battle tomorrow.
00:12:06.058,00:12:12.314,"Anyway, um, I kind of thought you were calling me with an I just want you to know."
00:12:12.398,00:12:13.482,A what?
00:12:14.275,00:12:15.735,"You know, an I just want you to know."
00:12:15.818,00:12:24.535,"It's like when people are like, If we never see each other again, I just want you to know, like, how I feel."
00:12:28.205,00:12:33.461,"You know that all communications with the launch room are recorded for posterity, Captain?"
00:12:35.212,00:12:37.006,"Okay. No. Copy that, Scientist."
00:12:37.089,00:12:39.675,"Yes, loud and clear, and never mind."
00:12:40.217,00:12:41.844,"Actually, Chief Scientist now."
00:12:41.927,00:12:43.220,Dr. Mallory quit today.
00:12:43.929,00:12:45.389,"Oh, wow. I mean..."
00:12:46.474,00:12:47.641,"Congratulations, I guess."
00:12:47.725,00:12:50.561,But I also can't help thinking that means I'm fucked.
00:12:51.228,00:12:52.855,No. You're a superhero.
00:12:52.938,00:12:54.732,And the queen of TikTok.
00:12:55.524,00:12:56.609,The what?
00:12:58.819,00:12:59.695,Goddamn it.
00:13:02.239,00:13:05.910,I cannot believe that's only like the tenth weirdest thing about today.
00:13:07.578,00:13:08.704,Thanks for showing me.
00:13:09.455,00:13:11.832,"Yeah. Well, I just wanted you to know."
00:13:12.625,00:13:13.626,That I'm a meme?
00:13:13.709,00:13:18.881,"Yeah! You know, in case, like, we never see each other again, I just wanted you to know."
00:13:25.638,00:13:27.181,-Thank you. -You're welcome.
00:13:30.851,00:13:32.770,"Is there any, uh, sauce?"
00:13:37.900,00:13:39.318,"Oh, that's no problem."
00:13:39.401,00:13:42.738,"Do you have any cheese or, uh, is there salad?"
00:13:45.991,00:13:48.244,"Mark, you said you were a good cook."
00:13:48.327,00:13:49.161,Yeah.
00:13:49.620,00:13:51.622,I'm so sorry. I'm not gonna eat this.
00:13:52.081,00:13:53.916,I'm not two years old.
00:13:53.999,00:13:55.000,I apologize.
00:13:56.585,00:13:58.921,-What's up? -Adrian Mallory quit today.
00:13:59.630,00:14:01.799,Why? Did you make him dinner?
00:14:03.634,00:14:07.012,He didn't like something that the military was doing.
00:14:07.429,00:14:09.807,"Oh, well, he sounds like a spoiled little shit."
00:14:10.307,00:14:12.476,"Sometimes he is, but not this time."
00:14:13.477,00:14:16.355,"Well, will he come back if you stop doing what you're doing?"
00:14:16.772,00:14:18.941,"Ah, I can't. It was an order."
00:14:21.569,00:14:22.528,"No, what are you doing?"
00:14:22.611,00:14:25.656,"Mark, what are you-- No. Stop it. I cannot let you eat that."
00:14:25.739,00:14:26.574,It's barely cooked.
00:14:26.657,00:14:27.741,It's crunchy.
00:14:27.825,00:14:28.951,"Oh, God. Here."
00:14:30.327,00:14:31.745,"No, no, no. No, no."
00:14:38.127,00:14:41.213,"It's not about sex, is it? Cause I don't mind if you're tipsy."
00:14:45.384,00:14:48.762,I have to be prepared to order soldiers into battle.
00:14:50.097,00:14:51.473,Can't really talk about it.
00:14:56.687,00:14:57.980,I don't know what to do.
00:15:04.278,00:15:08.699,"When you asked me out, you knew you had to tell me about your wife."
00:15:09.199,00:15:11.327,Even though it would probably ruin things.
00:15:12.161,00:15:14.622,You literally couldn't do the wrong thing.
00:15:15.789,00:15:17.249,So I'm not worried about you.
00:15:19.209,00:15:21.754,What if I don't know what the right thing to do is?
00:15:25.591,00:15:26.508,But you do.
00:15:27.343,00:15:28.177,Don't you?
00:15:38.103,00:15:39.355,Help me defy an order.
00:15:43.984,00:15:45.027,Ooh.
00:15:49.281,00:15:52.534,I've been defying authority since I was 13.
00:16:02.211,00:16:03.504,"Oh, God, I hate that."
00:16:03.587,00:16:08.217,"Yeah, of course, because you're a straight white male, you always had other weapons."
00:16:08.300,00:16:13.305,"But the rest of us, we have to be subtle in our disobedience, or we risk punishment."
00:16:15.808,00:16:18.519,"No, see, that's sarcasm. That's different."
00:16:18.852,00:16:28.862,"Imagine in this situation, you could say that you're following through with the order, but then you forget to, or you can interpret that order creatively."
00:16:28.946,00:16:36.578,"Destroy the bathroom could mean a number of things and, if all else fails, you can feign incompetent, which shouldn't be a problem."
00:16:36.662,00:16:38.539,"Well, that explains Brad, doesn't it?"
00:16:38.622,00:16:39.915,Not entirely.
00:16:40.332,00:16:41.250,Huh.
00:16:46.088,00:16:47.840,-What are we to do? -I'll handle it!
00:16:47.923,00:16:48.924,He'll handle it.
00:16:49.883,00:16:55.723,"Mr. Secretary, I just want to let you know before we begin, that I am running low on cell battery, so I may lose you."
00:16:55.806,00:16:57.850,"Uh, here's the situation as it stands."
00:17:00.060,00:17:01.895,Nobody answer the phone for the next two hours.
00:17:01.979,00:17:02.938,"Yes, sir."
00:17:21.123,00:17:21.957,Got a smoke?
00:17:25.502,00:17:26.670,Can't buy your own?
00:17:27.296,00:17:28.172,I can.
00:17:29.048,00:17:30.507,Just don't feel like it.
00:17:37.181,00:17:38.140,Tell you what.
00:17:39.016,00:17:40.392,I'll give it to you in my truck.
00:17:46.106,00:17:47.816,Come on. We're going to a party.
00:17:53.739,00:17:54.615,Fuck it.
00:18:20.766,00:18:24.436,Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics 2022.
00:18:24.520,00:18:25.437,We boycott.
00:18:25.521,00:18:26.814,Then they win even more medals.
00:18:26.897,00:18:29.775,"No, China's surprisingly awful at Winter Olympic sports."
00:18:29.858,00:18:31.777,"But boy-oh-boy, Norway would be happy."
00:18:31.860,00:18:33.821,"Okay, say you are a criminal."
00:18:34.321,00:18:39.660,"What would be meaner than TP-ing somebody's house, but not as aggressive as home invasion-slash-murder?"
00:18:39.743,00:18:42.412,Tying the family up and letting them think they're gonna be murdered.
00:18:42.496,00:18:44.748,Then they live with the fear and horror forever.
00:18:45.749,00:18:48.544,"Jesus, Brad. No wonder my dogs are scared of you."
00:18:50.671,00:18:52.422,"Uh, excuse me, General, sir."
00:18:56.009,00:18:56.969,Balls!
00:18:57.261,00:18:59.346,"All right, tell him I'll be right there."
00:18:59.429,00:19:00.472,Put him on hold.
00:19:01.640,00:19:03.559,-What are you gonna say? -I'm not gonna say anything.
00:19:03.642,00:19:06.145,I'm gonna go eat egg salad sandwiches until I puke.
00:19:20.576,00:19:21.743,Hey. Hey!
00:19:22.244,00:19:24.580,"Hey, I think, um, you can just let me out, like, right here."
00:19:24.663,00:19:26.540,That's-- That's totally fine.
00:19:28.917,00:19:30.419,Hey. You guys.
00:19:31.044,00:19:33.046,"Hey! Let me out here, okay?"
00:19:34.673,00:19:36.008,Excuse me!
00:19:36.758,00:19:38.552,Can you please let me out?
00:19:40.179,00:19:41.597,Fucking kidding me!
00:19:45.809,00:19:48.562,What the hell? Did you guys not hear me yelling?
00:20:10.417,00:20:12.294,Where-- Where-- Where's Grabaston?
00:20:14.546,00:20:17.716,Big Eagle is ready to replace the Dodo Bird!
00:20:19.927,00:20:21.803,I wish I was black on the moon.
00:20:22.721,00:20:23.555,"Thank you, sir."
00:20:29.144,00:20:30.896,"Yeah, I remember it well, sir."
00:20:31.480,00:20:33.357,"Today, I'm thinking about doing the same."
00:20:40.447,00:20:50.332,The generation that won World War II was exposed to so much awful reality that they made mostly good decisions for a long time after.
00:20:52.042,00:20:56.171,"Forget history, and you are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past."
00:20:56.880,00:21:00.968,"Forget how bad polio was, people stop taking vaccines."
00:21:02.302,00:21:06.390,"Forget how bad world wars are, people start puffing out their chests."
00:21:08.016,00:21:09.851,The real enemy is arrogance.
00:21:14.356,00:21:22.948,"Angela, I think there are springs and bolts and such in those Manchester Arms devices that would be better used to build your habitat."
00:21:23.031,00:21:26.702,I'd like you to disassemble them and let Eddie use the parts.
00:21:30.080,00:21:32.708,"...to take the guns apart, which would disable them, General."
00:21:32.791,00:21:33.834,That is correct.
00:21:36.962,00:21:38.171,"Thin ice, General."
00:21:39.131,00:21:40.257,Thin ice.
00:22:01.611,00:22:02.779,"Step aside, Gomer."
00:22:03.655,00:22:07.784,"Sir, I need to see some Space Force ID to let anyone inside."
00:22:08.201,00:22:10.120,Here is my Space Force ID.
00:22:17.377,00:22:19.588,And a second ID with a photo.
00:22:21.006,00:22:23.258,"A passport, Costco card."
00:22:24.009,00:22:26.803,"If you have to run on home-- Oh, for fuck's sakes, restrain him."
00:22:26.887,00:22:27.763,Gladly.
00:22:36.063,00:22:37.230,General Naird!
00:22:37.981,00:22:42.402,"You were ordered to order an attack, and I am ordering you to obey that order."
00:22:42.486,00:22:44.029,"I'm not your waitress, Kick."
00:22:44.112,00:22:46.615,I'm going to count to 125.
00:22:46.698,00:22:47.949,Just count to three.
00:22:51.495,00:22:52.788,"This is wrong, Kick."
00:22:53.205,00:22:54.790,"Deep down, you know it, too."
00:22:54.873,00:22:56.458,I don't give a shit.
00:22:57.209,00:22:58.085,Arrest him.
00:22:59.753,00:23:03.131,"And don't try to run, Naird, or we'll shoot you in the back."
00:23:08.220,00:23:09.971,"Her name is Captain Ali, sir."
00:23:10.472,00:23:14.684,"Captain Ali, you are hereby ordered to attack the Chinese base."
00:23:14.768,00:23:15.727,"Can't, sir."
00:23:15.811,00:23:16.728,Guns are disabled.
00:23:16.812,00:23:20.107,"The barrels are now water pipes, and the springs are in the thermostats."
00:23:20.190,00:23:22.901,Naird... that's treason.
00:23:26.279,00:23:29.241,"Well, there must be something else you can use as weapons."
00:23:29.324,00:23:31.743,We have a crazy amount of wrenches.
00:23:31.827,00:23:34.663,The big brainiac packed wrench after wrench.
00:23:34.746,00:23:35.705,Go get 'em.
00:23:36.081,00:23:37.207,Bigger the better.
00:23:37.791,00:23:39.334,"Sir, where is General Naird?"
00:23:39.418,00:23:41.002,I am in command now.
00:23:41.628,00:23:43.505,It's wrenchin' time.
00:23:44.923,00:23:48.093,"It, um... It looks like we're actually doing this."
00:24:00.355,00:24:01.189,Julio!
00:24:02.023,00:24:04.109,-Spacesuit. -Oh. Yes.
00:24:45.650,00:24:47.152,"Oh, okay."
00:25:00.081,00:25:03.627,"Dad, Dad, I'm in the desert, west of town, with some sketchy dudes."
00:25:07.380,00:25:08.924,You have to make good choices.
00:25:09.007,00:25:12.093,"It wasn't. It was a terrible choice, but I need you to come get me, okay?"
00:25:12.177,00:25:14.221,You said I could always call you if I needed a ride.
00:25:14.304,00:25:17.432,"I know, I know I did. But I can't come right now."
00:25:17.516,00:25:18.600,I've been arrested.
00:25:19.267,00:25:20.977,What? No. Mom was arrested.
00:25:21.061,00:25:22.312,"Yeah, I'm aware of that."
00:25:22.395,00:25:24.439,"I'm... I have been, too. I'm sorry."
00:25:25.565,00:25:26.525,"Well, that's great!"
00:25:26.608,00:25:29.236,"Both my parents are in jail, and I can't get a tattoo. Okay."
00:25:29.319,00:25:30.278,Honey! Honey!
00:25:30.695,00:25:31.571,God.
00:25:32.739,00:25:33.657,Fu...
00:25:35.408,00:25:36.326,All right.
00:25:40.580,00:25:41.623,Yeah.
00:25:47.254,00:25:49.422,No. I'm sitting next to your dad.
00:25:49.881,00:25:51.049,"I got arrested, too."
00:26:19.703,00:26:22.581,"For the record, I am against this action."
00:26:22.664,00:26:23.873,"Someone's taking notes, right?"
00:26:25.542,00:26:27.252,This is all Kick's baby now.
00:26:32.549,00:26:34.050,"Fuck Tony, come with me."
00:26:38.680,00:26:42.684,I am the former Chief Scientist of Space Force.
00:26:43.101,00:26:49.441,"And if the world does not stop this madness, I will set myself on fire!"
00:26:49.524,00:26:51.359,"Yes, the entire world is listening. This is your moment."
00:26:51.818,00:26:55.780,I'll give you one chance to change course!
00:26:55.864,00:26:57.407,Don't do it. Don't do it.
00:26:57.490,00:27:00.035,"Don't you try and stop me, Brad!"
00:27:00.118,00:27:01.453,I am doing it!
00:27:01.953,00:27:04.789,"Okey-dokey. Well, you're a better man than I'll ever be."
00:27:04.873,00:27:05.707,Wait.
00:27:11.004,00:27:12.339,"Yes, this is gas."
00:27:12.422,00:27:14.382,I guess the first step would be to sprinkle it on your pants.
00:27:14.466,00:27:17.344,So I suppose I should do that now?
00:27:17.427,00:27:18.261,Yeah.
00:27:20.805,00:27:21.765,"Oh, Jesus."
00:27:22.265,00:27:24.059,"If you need help, I can help you out. Here..."
00:27:24.142,00:27:27.020,"Thank you, Fuck Tony, but you know what?"
00:27:27.729,00:27:32.442,I-- I think I've proven what I wanted to prove.
00:27:32.859,00:27:35.987,"I mean, let's face it. At the end of the day, I think I'm done."
00:27:36.071,00:27:38.198,-I'm good. -We're already here. We got the gasoline.
00:27:38.281,00:27:41.368,"No, I know, but it's... I'm good. It's fine. Thank you."
00:27:42.202,00:27:45.622,"Mom, I'm in trouble, and Dad and the only other guy I know who could help are useless."
00:27:46.039,00:27:48.458,"Well, don't tell me that when I can't do anything."
00:27:48.541,00:27:49.751,"Jesus, honey!"
00:27:49.834,00:27:51.169,"Mommy, I'm scared."
00:28:18.488,00:28:19.364,Fuck.
00:28:50.770,00:28:52.856,Or are you just glad to see me?
00:28:55.066,00:28:56.067,I have it.
00:28:58.445,00:28:59.696,Okay. Okay.
00:29:01.990,00:29:02.949,Good. Good. Good.
00:29:10.540,00:29:11.416,Okay.
00:29:12.333,00:29:13.168,Okay.
00:29:28.725,00:29:29.601,Fuck.
00:29:49.120,00:29:49.954,Fuck!
00:30:18.608,00:30:20.777,"Jesus! Erin, no helmet?"
00:30:22.195,00:30:24.531,"-So, who doesn't have your back? -Okay, yes."
00:30:47.220,00:30:48.054,Okay.
00:30:48.555,00:30:49.597,Let's do this thing.
00:30:51.808,00:30:55.186,"Wait. Dad, do you see something down there in the gully?"
00:30:58.231,00:30:59.691,"Oh, my God."
00:31:12.412,00:31:13.621,-Mom! -Hi!
00:31:13.705,00:31:14.831,I escaped!
00:31:14.914,00:31:16.457,Just came to save you!
00:31:17.125,00:31:18.126,Sweetie!
00:31:19.669,00:31:21.129,"Oh, you guys!"
00:31:26.050,00:31:27.886,-This is Louise. -Hi.
00:31:27.969,00:31:29.512,She's been very helpful.
00:31:30.930,00:31:32.056,This is great!
00:31:33.308,00:31:34.475,We're all together.
00:31:35.977,00:31:37.061,And Louise.
00:31:51.910,00:31:56.164,Tell General Grabaston we've rendered the Chinese moon base inoperable.
00:31:56.247,00:32:03.254,"Destroyed the life-support systems, breached the capsule walls in all pods, and released the oxygen as ordered."
00:32:03.755,00:32:10.178,We are returning with their extra stores and will prepare to receive the scientists as refugees at the US base.
00:32:12.931,00:32:13.890,"Oh, shit!"
00:32:14.265,00:32:15.099,Captain Ali?
00:32:34.702,00:32:35.870,Now what do we do?
00:32:42.961,00:32:44.420,which is great. Congrats.
00:32:46.631,00:32:52.387,"No matter, you know, what they're saying. I don't wanna worry you, but the spacemen are just a little tiny bit fucked."
00:32:52.470,00:32:56.349,"So if you could maybe sneak back and give us a hand, you know, it'd be great."
00:32:56.432,00:33:01.354,"But, you know, of course, you'll probably be court-martialed if you come back, so tough choice."
00:33:01.437,00:33:03.439,Ooh. I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes.
00:00:22.439,00:00:24.315,Sleepyhead. Another late night?
00:00:24.733,00:00:26.568,-Another early morning? -You know what they say.
00:00:28.445,00:00:29.821,Know what the night owl catches?
00:00:32.115,00:00:34.242,"Yeah, well, I'd rather eat a rat than a worm."
00:00:35.285,00:00:37.746,"Having tried both, I think you would prefer the worms."
00:00:37.829,00:00:40.165,Rats are very sinewy in texture.
00:00:40.665,00:00:55.513,Worms go down quite easily. That's why I-- That's why I call them the spaghetti of the ground.
00:00:55.597,00:00:58.558,Wow! Sounds crazy.
00:00:59.601,00:01:00.518,Uh...
00:01:00.602,00:01:02.854,"you are going to clean up after yourself, are you not?"
00:01:04.272,00:01:05.607,I have to go to school. I'm late.
00:01:05.690,00:01:09.152,"Hmm. Well, if you'd just gotten up when your alarm went off, you wouldn't be late, so clean up the counter."
00:01:09.235,00:01:10.820,"Jesus Christ, Dad. Get off my back."
00:01:10.904,00:01:16.993,"I want you to go over there and wipe the counter because if you don't, it's going to attract ants."
00:01:17.077,00:01:19.871,"It's really not that big a deal, okay? Quit being such a bitch about it."
00:01:19.954,00:01:22.957,"Hey, hey, hey! You do not talk to me that way."
00:01:23.041,00:01:24.459,"Yes, sir, General Naird."
00:01:24.542,00:01:27.879,Get your keister in there and clean the kitchen.
00:01:27.962,00:01:29.506,That is a direct order.
00:01:31.299,00:01:32.175,Damn it.
00:01:32.258,00:01:34.094,"You're good with this, right? You're okay with this?"
00:01:34.177,00:01:35.720,"Oh, he is not the father."
00:01:36.554,00:01:38.014,"Uh, Mallory's in your office."
00:01:42.018,00:01:43.978,"Oh, uh, also, FLOTUS's office called."
00:01:44.062,00:01:46.898,The first lady has some thoughts on Space Force uniforms.
00:01:47.357,00:01:48.399,We have uniforms.
00:01:48.483,00:01:50.610,"Well, she thinks they could use some refinement."
00:01:50.693,00:01:52.028,-Handle it. -Really?
00:01:52.112,00:01:53.738,I don't know much about clothing design.
00:01:53.822,00:01:55.073,"No, make it go away."
00:01:55.156,00:01:57.325,Your only job is to help me. So help me.
00:01:57.742,00:01:58.785,"I'll do my best, sir."
00:01:58.868,00:02:00.120,Do my best.
00:02:00.203,00:02:02.539,The last 20 seconds has reminded me that your best is terrible.
00:02:02.622,00:02:03.498,Understood.
00:02:06.459,00:02:07.293,You're late.
00:02:07.377,00:02:11.673,"I have marital problems, teenager problems, FLOTUS problems."
00:02:11.756,00:02:13.967,I don't have the bandwidth for any more problems.
00:02:14.050,00:02:16.719,-What do you want? -The lunar habitat experiment.
00:02:17.095,00:02:18.972,Mmm. Yes. Your moon tent.
00:02:19.055,00:02:20.098,"It's serious, Mark."
00:02:20.181,00:02:25.520,"If we can't prove that we can live on the moon, then there is no moon base, there is no Mars base."
00:02:25.603,00:02:28.731,The lunar habitat experiment's been going on two years.
00:02:28.815,00:02:32.569,"If it fails, then the whole mission is set back by that amount of time."
00:02:32.986,00:02:34.070,So what's the problem?
00:02:34.154,00:02:37.323,Three spacemen and a civilian sculptor.
00:02:37.407,00:02:39.117,Jesus. A sculptor? Why?
00:02:39.200,00:02:43.538,The personality dynamics are the subject of the experiment.
00:02:43.621,00:02:54.382,"The sculptor's humane creativity is meant to balance the rationality of the astronauts, but now, one week left, one of them has gone..."
00:02:54.465,00:02:55.425,Don't say AWOL.
00:02:55.508,00:02:57.260,-...mad. -Thank God.
00:02:57.343,00:03:00.221,"-I bet it was the sculptor. -Uh, actually, it wasn't."
00:03:00.305,00:03:01.306,"Okay, whatever."
00:03:01.389,00:03:03.474,Let's just find someone else and throw 'em in there.
00:03:03.558,00:03:04.893,How hard can that be?
00:03:05.351,00:03:06.394,It's not that easy.
00:03:06.477,00:03:11.733,They had to be exhaustively tested -for psychological fitness. -Mm-hmm.
00:03:11.816,00:03:17.572,"If we don't get a cool, calm, collected presence in there stat, this experiment is doomed."
00:03:18.198,00:03:20.575,Maybe the Navy can loan us one of their submariners.
00:03:20.658,00:03:22.744,They have a superior mental fitness.
00:03:22.827,00:03:29.167,"To be trapped underwater with 100 men's farts, you have to be so strong."
00:03:31.127,00:03:32.295,All right. I'll do it.
00:03:33.379,00:03:39.594,"Mark, though an amazing commander, you've had no psychological counseling whatsoever."
00:03:39.677,00:03:40.762,"Oh, no need."
00:03:40.845,00:03:41.930,My screws are tight.
00:03:42.388,00:03:45.808,"Sir, with all due respect, you'd go to pieces."
00:03:46.809,00:03:51.814,"Dr. Chan, I have been chased through the Bosnian woods by the entire Serb 3rd Army."
00:03:51.898,00:03:54.901,I think that I can spend a week in a plastic Motel 6.
00:03:55.235,00:03:56.236,I'm gonna pack my bag.
00:03:56.319,00:03:58.238,Tell my bunkmates I'm headed to Crater Camp.
00:04:21.928,00:04:28.893,"Obviously, a uniform designed by the first lady would be quite a coup, and I understand her desire to support right-wing clothing designers -out of fairness... -Is that the first lady?"
00:04:28.977,00:04:29.978,Let me talk to her real quick.
00:04:30.061,00:04:33.731,"Uh, I'm sorry. I have to put you on hold. One of our rockets, uh, did something."
00:04:34.524,00:04:37.360,Go away. I'm not on with FLOTUS. I'm on with her chief of staff.
00:04:37.443,00:04:39.112,"Oh, my sweet, innocent Brad."
00:04:39.195,00:04:44.742,"Chief of staff is only one step away from FLOTUS, who's only one step away from POTUS."
00:04:44.826,00:04:46.828,"You gotta develop the relationship, bruh."
00:04:46.911,00:04:48.162,"Well, I don't know, bruh."
00:04:48.246,00:04:49.247,"Well, it's happening. Yoink."
00:04:49.330,00:04:53.001,"Hey, this is Space Force head media manager F. Tony Scarapiducci."
00:04:53.084,00:04:54.168,Who am I speaking with?
00:04:54.252,00:04:56.296,This is FLOTUS Chief of Staff Evelyn Murray.
00:04:58.756,00:05:00.466,"-Stop that! -Oh, this is so exciting."
00:05:00.550,00:05:05.179,I can't tell you how thrilled we are that the first lady has shown interest in our Space Force uniforms.
00:05:05.263,00:05:10.268,"But, of course, the process of adapting our current uniforms is complex and close to impossible."
00:05:10.351,00:05:13.479,"However, doing the impossible, Evvy, it's what we're all about."
00:05:13.563,00:05:19.569,"To clarify, while we welcome the first lady's input, it is very important that we manage expectations."
00:05:23.114,00:05:25.533,"I'm tingling. I'm actually tingling, Evvy."
00:05:30.705,00:05:31.622,Ha!
00:05:31.706,00:05:32.915,What are you doing?
00:05:32.999,00:05:34.709,Naird asked me to shut this down.
00:05:34.792,00:05:37.170,And you also just punched a general. That is not cool.
00:05:37.253,00:05:39.464,One-star general. Always say one-star general.
00:05:39.547,00:05:40.506,I don't have to do that.
00:05:40.590,00:05:42.008,"Just follow my lead, okay, Brad?"
00:05:42.425,00:05:43.593,It's gonna be great.
00:05:43.676,00:05:45.803,"You know, I could use a little vacation."
00:05:45.887,00:05:47.388,This is just what I need.
00:05:47.472,00:05:49.057,"It's no vacation, Mark."
00:05:50.558,00:05:52.143,Relax. I got this.
00:05:52.852,00:05:56.814,I am what used to be known in America as a man.
00:05:57.690,00:06:02.153,"So let's take a make-believe trip to the fake moon, right?"
00:06:18.252,00:06:20.004,You may now enter the habitat.
00:06:32.892,00:06:34.685,Wow. That is ripe.
00:06:37.980,00:06:38.815,Hello?
00:06:39.399,00:06:40.233,Hey.
00:06:40.316,00:06:42.110,We're making dinner. Come join us.
00:06:42.193,00:06:43.611,Hope you like potatoes.
00:06:44.153,00:06:47.365,"Well, I'm not much of a potato man myself."
00:06:47.448,00:06:48.783,I like my starch in my collars.
00:06:50.284,00:06:53.830,But you folks have really doubled down on the potatoes.
00:06:54.372,00:06:58.584,"Say, looks like nice, rich soil here."
00:06:59.919,00:07:02.213,Have you ever considered growing asparagus?
00:07:02.296,00:07:04.841,From moon dust fertilized with our feces?
00:07:05.425,00:07:06.884,"Oh, I never thought of that."
00:07:06.968,00:07:10.805,"Hey, gang, maybe we could have grown pineapples and chocolate pies."
00:07:11.973,00:07:14.517,You must be Major Jane Pike.
00:07:14.976,00:07:17.979,"Microbiologist, winner of the Carlos J. Finlay prize."
00:07:18.062,00:07:19.564,And now I grow potatoes.
00:07:21.232,00:07:24.819,"Well, I would maybe lead with the prize thing."
00:07:25.403,00:07:30.074,"Captain Dave Powers, astronaut, six missions to the ISS. Very impressive."
00:07:30.158,00:07:32.994,And yet here I am... with Jerome.
00:07:33.327,00:07:36.497,"Ah, yes. The sculptor."
00:07:36.873,00:07:40.585,Have you sculpted anything that I would be familiar with?
00:07:40.668,00:07:44.130,Perhaps a national monument or war memorial?
00:07:44.213,00:07:46.674,I make giant phalluses out of sand.
00:07:46.757,00:07:49.135,They're in the Native American Museum in Taos.
00:07:49.218,00:07:51.846,There's also one in the desert right outside the base.
00:07:51.929,00:07:54.265,I thought that was teenagers.
00:07:55.975,00:07:58.144,"Dave, I don't wanna give you any unsolicited advice..."
00:08:03.649,00:08:08.112,"There's a sticky film on top, and, yeah, those are ants."
00:08:08.196,00:08:09.363,You've got ants in there.
00:08:09.447,00:08:10.323,No.
00:08:10.406,00:08:12.450,"Yes, I can clearly see ants right there."
00:08:12.867,00:08:15.828,"Well, that is impossible, because there are no ants on the moon."
00:08:18.206,00:08:19.332,I'd like you to clean it up.
00:08:20.458,00:08:22.043,I don't take orders from you.
00:08:22.502,00:08:23.878,We're all equals here.
00:08:23.961,00:08:25.213,Except maybe new guy.
00:08:26.172,00:08:27.548,General New Guy.
00:08:28.424,00:08:31.761,"Captain, Major, sculptor, I would like you to clean this mess up."
00:08:31.844,00:08:32.929,Immediately.
00:08:36.766,00:08:37.767,Ten hut!
00:09:10.550,00:09:11.717,Okay.
00:09:14.262,00:09:18.724,"Uh, hey, guys. My dad's away, so party at my house here night."
00:09:18.808,00:09:20.268,Feel free to forward...
00:09:21.060,00:09:22.353,narcs not welcome.
00:09:25.731,00:09:26.607,"Yeah, okay."
00:10:08.190,00:10:09.191,Hey.
00:10:09.650,00:10:12.570,I stopped singing. You can stop that... ing.
00:10:22.913,00:10:24.123,There's a treadmill for that.
00:10:24.540,00:10:26.083,I prefer the open road.
00:10:37.345,00:10:39.597,-What are you guys up to? -Feelings survey.
00:10:41.223,00:10:43.184,-What? -I thought you said feelings survey.
00:10:43.267,00:10:44.727,"Yeah, it's for Mallory."
00:10:44.810,00:10:47.438,It's a detailed diary of everything that's bothering us.
00:10:47.521,00:10:49.398,It's kind of the point of the whole thing.
00:10:49.482,00:10:55.863,"Like if we're upset that we can't sleep, and then we stay up thinking about not being able to sleep, and that makes us stay up even longer."
00:10:55.946,00:10:57.490,"Whoa, whoa. No, no, no."
00:10:58.574,00:10:59.742,You did not put that down.
00:11:01.369,00:11:02.578,That is not upset.
00:11:02.662,00:11:05.164,Upset is getting your plane shot out from under you.
00:11:05.247,00:11:10.127,Upset is when a so-called smart bomb misses the tank and hits a tour bus.
00:11:10.544,00:11:11.545,That is upset.
00:11:11.629,00:11:16.676,I will go out on a limb and say that none of you have ever actually been upset.
00:11:25.768,00:11:27.353,Who put the tube on the track?
00:11:28.270,00:11:29.480,You broke it.
00:11:32.233,00:11:33.401,Not your foot.
00:11:33.484,00:11:34.819,My didgeridoo.
00:11:34.902,00:11:37.405,"Oh, stop talking baby talk. You're a grown man."
00:11:41.575,00:11:43.160,Now I have nothing.
00:11:43.244,00:11:47.957,"Well, maybe it would not have happened if any of you knew how to keep an environment clean."
00:11:48.040,00:11:52.086,I'll have you know that clutter often goes hand in hand with creativity.
00:11:52.169,00:11:53.879,"Well, kudos."
00:11:53.963,00:11:56.173,Both you and my child are very creative.
00:12:10.020,00:12:13.023,Why can't he just follow the rules like everyone else?
00:12:13.107,00:12:14.442,What seemed like an accident...
00:12:18.487,00:12:19.488,Okay.
00:12:21.198,00:12:22.825,Hey-- Oh.
00:12:25.119,00:12:26.996,Twenty pies for Erin Naird.
00:12:28.622,00:12:30.124,Am I at the wrong house?
00:12:37.047,00:12:39.091,Twenty pizzas is a lot of pizzas.
00:13:02.281,00:13:03.407,"More, Daddy."
00:13:06.076,00:13:08.204,Here's a little bit more then. How about that?
00:13:08.287,00:13:09.288,"More, Daddy!"
00:13:09.371,00:13:11.165,I didn't expect that answer!
00:13:11.248,00:13:12.208,There you go.
00:13:13.667,00:13:15.461,"-More, Daddy! -Bah! All right!"
00:13:15.544,00:13:16.670,Let's eat.
00:13:41.070,00:13:45.616,"I heard him moaning, Daddy will give you more cream, over and over."
00:13:45.908,00:13:46.867,Ew.
00:13:46.951,00:13:48.869,That dude just makes me uncomfortable.
00:13:49.203,00:13:51.413,I don't know how I'm gonna get through the next few days.
00:13:52.164,00:13:57.253,"Subject four was supposed to balance the dynamic, but he's actually destabilizing it."
00:13:57.336,00:14:02.883,"Instead of a solid four-sided square, it's become a triangle of spite against him."
00:14:02.967,00:14:04.677,His blood pressure is spiking.
00:14:04.760,00:14:08.597,And his bowel movements have become miserly and unspontaneous.
00:14:18.566,00:14:21.735,All this man does is eat his feelings.
00:14:21.819,00:14:24.697,Who knows what he is holding inside.
00:14:25.447,00:14:27.992,"From the look of it, sir, mostly mashed potatoes."
00:14:32.788,00:14:34.582,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd wear these."
00:14:34.665,00:14:36.876,"-Yeah, so would the Greatest Showman. -Okay, you know what?"
00:14:36.959,00:14:39.628,"The movie might have sucked, but that soundtrack was fire."
00:14:39.712,00:14:40.671,Yeah...
00:14:44.466,00:14:45.509,I'm ending this.
00:14:47.803,00:14:49.138,General Gregory speaking.
00:14:50.598,00:14:55.144,"-Uh, yes, we did, and I have to, uh-- -Yes, yes, yes! And they were to die for."
00:14:55.227,00:14:59.732,"But as wonderful as they are, we do have some practical concerns about functionality."
00:14:59.815,00:15:01.317,Have your troops tried them on?
00:15:02.985,00:15:05.613,"Well, FLOTUS would like to see some pictures of them in action."
00:15:06.739,00:15:07.907,"Uh, let me think about that."
00:15:07.990,00:15:10.951,"We thought about it, and, Evvy, we are all over that."
00:15:19.752,00:15:21.712,-Bap it! -No. Why am I in a cape?
00:15:21.795,00:15:23.672,"I mean, she knows we're not Avengers, right?"
00:15:23.756,00:15:25.591,How many buttons does a jacket need?
00:15:25.674,00:15:27.760,"By the time I get this on, the war will be over."
00:15:27.843,00:15:29.637,Why are all these seams pointing to my wenis?
00:15:31.805,00:15:33.015,-What? -No? Are you Hugo Boss?
00:15:33.098,00:15:36.060,-Who? -No? Then shut the fuck up and bap it.
00:15:36.435,00:15:38.687,"-Dude, I think he sewed them. -No, I didn't sew them."
00:15:38.771,00:15:46.487,"-Did you sew them? -No, I didn't, but the woman who did is an absolute genius and has earned our respect, so please just pretend like you're into it, okay?"
00:15:46.570,00:15:49.490,"I'm sorry, I can't, because I'm actually not that good of an actor. General."
00:15:49.573,00:15:51.075,Hmm? I'm sorry.
00:15:51.158,00:15:53.786,FLOTUS doesn't have the power to force us to wear these.
00:15:54.203,00:15:55.162,I don't think.
00:15:58.290,00:15:59.416,I miss you.
00:15:59.917,00:16:00.918,I miss you too.
00:16:01.835,00:16:02.878,I like your...
00:16:03.754,00:16:05.255,"-Oh, the cornrows? -Yeah."
00:16:05.339,00:16:06.507,"Oh, yeah, my roommate did it."
00:16:07.508,00:16:10.260,Yeah. It's not appropriation when they do it to you.
00:16:10.344,00:16:11.387,Oh.
00:16:11.929,00:16:13.138,How are you?
00:16:13.847,00:16:15.891,How's school going? Are you making new friends?
00:16:16.809,00:16:18.394,I really miss DC.
00:16:19.144,00:16:20.270,"Yeah, I do too."
00:16:20.688,00:16:21.772,"Also, my freedom."
00:16:22.564,00:16:24.942,"But, honey, it's important to adapt."
00:16:25.401,00:16:26.443,Try to fit in.
00:16:28.988,00:16:31.407,Did I say gang? I meant club.
00:16:31.490,00:16:33.450,"Basically, it's a book club. How's Daddy?"
00:16:33.534,00:16:34.576,Insane.
00:16:35.619,00:16:39.206,He treats me like a total child and then leaves me with a Post-it Note.
00:16:41.208,00:16:43.627,Going into the lunar habitat. Don't call.
00:16:44.795,00:16:45.754,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:16:45.838,00:16:47.047,What's wrong with him?
00:16:47.506,00:16:48.841,"I don't know, really."
00:16:49.800,00:16:50.968,And neither does he.
00:16:51.051,00:16:58.183,"You know, those top military guys, they're too afraid to get into therapy because they can have their security clearance taken away."
00:16:58.267,00:16:59.184,Ah!
00:16:59.643,00:17:02.730,"Okay. Well, that explains a lot."
00:17:03.731,00:17:06.608,"A week away in a lunar habitat, alone with his thoughts?"
00:17:07.317,00:17:10.904,"I spent two days in solitary, and it almost broke me."
00:17:12.114,00:17:13.115,Wait. What?
00:17:13.198,00:17:14.366,I did what I had to do.
00:17:14.450,00:17:16.744,"You take away my sourdough bread, you're gonna get poisoned."
00:17:16.827,00:17:18.412,-Time's up. -Mom.
00:17:18.495,00:17:21.623,"He's probably feeling lonely too, so you gotta be there for each other."
00:17:22.166,00:17:23.125,Too?
00:17:23.625,00:17:25.419,That hair is a cry for help.
00:17:25.502,00:17:29.256,"It's a cry for help, just like Daddy's lunar habitat."
00:17:38.724,00:17:41.185,Sorry I'm late. Nobody told me about dinner.
00:17:41.643,00:17:44.313,It's all in the schedule. Maybe get with the program.
00:17:44.730,00:17:45.647,No problem.
00:17:47.441,00:17:51.236,I'll just whip up a bit of the old...
00:17:52.696,00:17:53.864,potato.
00:18:05.084,00:18:05.959,God.
00:19:02.766,00:19:03.600,Mark.
00:19:04.852,00:19:05.686,Mark!
00:19:11.859,00:19:12.818,Are you okay?
00:19:14.945,00:19:15.779,Yeah.
00:19:17.197,00:19:19.783,Do you want some scotch? I've got a swallow left.
00:19:21.034,00:19:22.119,"No, I'm good."
00:19:22.202,00:19:23.245,All right.
00:19:28.876,00:19:30.586,-Roger that. -Good night.
00:20:16.340,00:20:17.257,What are you doing?
00:20:17.341,00:20:19.927,I gotta go for a real run. Work off some of this energy.
00:20:20.552,00:20:22.137,Don't forget your space suit.
00:20:22.221,00:20:24.181,You can't breathe on the moon.
00:20:37.653,00:20:41.865,Sweat is weakness leaving the body.
00:20:42.324,00:20:44.576,Your heart rate is quite high.
00:20:44.660,00:20:46.620,And he still hasn't had a bowel movement.
00:20:49.915,00:20:57.506,I can't have this experiment fall apart because you're too stubborn to admit that you weren't right for this mission.
00:21:34.459,00:21:35.419,Go away.
00:21:37.337,00:21:38.922,I am. I'm ending this.
00:21:52.978,00:22:00.068,"Ma'am, this is very difficult for me to say, but the uniforms, well, they're just not working for us."
00:22:03.947,00:22:05.490,we can't go in this direction.
00:22:10.037,00:22:11.038,Sounds good.
00:22:12.914,00:22:14.249,"Come on, Brad!"
00:22:35.604,00:22:36.563,He's alive.
00:22:41.026,00:22:43.403,"No, no, no. Don't get up. You're too weak."
00:22:43.487,00:22:45.489,Ah... I'm not weak. You're weak.
00:22:52.579,00:22:53.455,Mm.
00:22:57.417,00:22:58.418,I've had worse.
00:23:01.463,00:23:02.589,Rats. Worms.
00:23:08.553,00:23:09.763,I've eaten bugs.
00:23:11.181,00:23:12.724,"Where'd you eat bugs, Mark?"
00:23:12.808,00:23:14.309,I don't know. Various places.
00:23:15.644,00:23:16.561,Bosnia.
00:23:19.064,00:23:21.233,I crash-landed in hostile territory.
00:23:24.111,00:23:26.655,I was in the woods for ten days.
00:23:27.948,00:23:28.907,On the run.
00:23:33.328,00:23:34.287,Alone.
00:23:41.211,00:23:42.129,Let us help.
00:23:53.056,00:23:54.349,How's that even possible?
00:23:57.144,00:23:58.103,I don't know.
00:24:00.021,00:24:05.318,"Plus, China and Russia are trying to take out our internet every day."
00:24:11.241,00:24:12.367,Yeah. Yeah.
00:24:12.451,00:24:13.869,And if I can't protect it...
00:24:15.579,00:24:17.080,"Well, that's a lot of stress."
00:24:17.164,00:24:18.081,Yeah.
00:24:20.333,00:24:22.252,My daughter and I fight constantly.
00:24:22.794,00:24:24.880,"Half the time, I don't even know what we're fighting about."
00:24:26.047,00:24:28.008,"Well, what about your wife? Can she help?"
00:24:33.388,00:24:35.140,-Oh. -I'm sorry.
00:24:37.350,00:24:38.560,Have some more tea.
00:24:38.935,00:24:40.187,Tea fixes everything.
00:24:40.645,00:24:42.689,"Oh. Thank you, Jerome."
00:24:45.358,00:24:52.908,"I would love to get my parents into one of those assisted living centers, but they're so damn expensive, and my dad..."
00:24:53.783,00:24:55.535,is really proud. He doesn't wanna go.
00:24:56.077,00:24:58.830,"My mom's not quite all there, so it'd be tough for her too."
00:25:09.549,00:25:11.134,I am going to hit the sack.
00:25:12.010,00:25:15.055,Thank you for letting me get that off my back.
00:25:27.734,00:25:30.487,Was that shit real about the planet-killing laser?
00:25:31.738,00:25:33.448,I'm just hoping it was a metaphor.
00:25:33.532,00:25:35.033,Yeah. It's probably...
00:25:35.992,00:25:37.118,probably a metaphor.
00:25:37.202,00:25:38.078,Yeah.
00:25:48.797,00:25:49.756,Mmm.
00:26:21.496,00:26:23.582,Wow. What an adventure.
00:26:24.874,00:26:26.334,I've only been here a week.
00:26:26.418,00:26:29.337,I feel like I went to the moon.
00:26:30.046,00:26:31.047,And beyond.
00:26:31.131,00:26:32.257,"You did, Mark."
00:26:32.716,00:26:34.718,You took a trip inside your soul.
00:26:34.801,00:26:38.388,Stared into a darkness more empty than space itself.
00:26:39.139,00:26:40.765,"Ah, art."
00:26:41.308,00:26:43.059,"I'm glad you're here, Jerome."
00:26:43.518,00:26:44.853,People need feelings.
00:26:48.815,00:26:50.358,"Spacemen, let's head home."
00:27:52.003,00:27:53.755,"Oh, didn't expect you tonight."
00:27:55.632,00:27:57.425,"Uh, it was, uh, pretty uneventful."
00:27:57.509,00:27:58.760,Yeah. Mm-hmm.
00:27:58.843,00:27:59.886,How was the moon?
00:28:02.097,00:28:03.264,"Yeah, I'm sure you are."
00:28:03.390,00:28:05.392,"Uh, let's take the elevator."
00:28:05.475,00:28:06.434,You're tired.
00:28:06.935,00:28:07.769,Yeah.
00:28:08.311,00:28:09.187,Here we go.
00:28:14.401,00:28:16.695,You will get rid of those uniforms by tomorrow.
00:28:18.738,00:28:19.823,He's impossible.
00:28:20.073,00:28:21.658,I did a great job while you were gone.
00:28:22.951,00:28:24.869,"-Good night, sir. -Good night, Bradley."
00:29:07.746,00:29:08.580,Erin?
00:29:09.956,00:29:10.915,Dad?
00:29:13.877,00:29:14.711,Hey.
00:29:14.794,00:29:15.670,Hey.
00:29:19.299,00:29:20.467,Sorry about the mess.
00:29:22.844,00:29:24.137,I got ice cream.
00:29:24.929,00:29:25.889,You want some?
00:29:27.849,00:29:29.100,"Yeah, that sounds good."
00:00:31.906,00:00:35.035,POTUS is still mad about the whole India thing.
00:00:35.118,00:00:38.913,"So, as punishment, he wants us to partner with private industry."
00:00:38.997,00:00:45.295,"Specifically, he wants us to use this tech guru's new fuel in the lunar satellite launch."
00:00:45.545,00:00:46.546,Not her.
00:00:48.006,00:00:49.966,Ed... Edison Jaymes? Are you kidding me?
00:00:50.050,00:00:56.681,No. She's gonna be here in a few minutes to inspect the base and make sure that we are worthy of her product.
00:00:56.765,00:00:57.724,I read about that.
00:00:57.807,00:01:01.936,"It's supposedly half as heavy as normal fuel, and no pollutants."
00:01:02.020,00:01:03.730,"I mean, that would be a game changer."
00:01:03.813,00:01:07.358,"God, I am so sick of people fawning over these young tech moguls."
00:01:07.442,00:01:09.194,The government is plenty innovative.
00:01:09.277,00:01:16.409,Did you know that the US Postal Service issues a new Christmas stamp every Christmas and has done so for the past 200 years?
00:01:16.826,00:01:19.496,"Mark, I don't think the Postal Service still exists."
00:01:20.747,00:01:22.540,"-Well, I think they do. -No."
00:01:22.624,00:01:24.959,Where do you think our funding came from?
00:01:33.885,00:01:34.928,She's late.
00:01:35.178,00:01:36.471,She's too rich to be late.
00:01:45.772,00:01:49.275,"Well, jeans and $100,000 worth of diamonds."
00:01:49.359,00:01:50.401,That's a good look.
00:01:50.485,00:01:51.903,It's a confusing look.
00:01:51.986,00:01:55.657,I don't know whether she's going to Cinderella's ball or a pig roast.
00:01:56.366,00:01:58.284,Fuck. Fuck me.
00:02:02.789,00:02:04.290,We came up in the PR world together.
00:02:04.374,00:02:10.046,She single-handedly orchestrated my dismissal from American Apparel by leaking my text messages.
00:02:10.505,00:02:13.842,She is by far the worst person I have ever met in my entire life.
00:02:14.259,00:02:15.135,Hannah!
00:02:15.218,00:02:16.845,"Oh, my God, I'm coming down."
00:02:16.928,00:02:18.012,You look amazing!
00:02:25.603,00:02:30.650,-General Naird. -Welcome to Space-- Good to tweet?
00:02:31.359,00:02:33.069,"-Yes, with the usual adjustments. -Of course."
00:02:33.778,00:02:37.198,"When POTUS called me and asked me to help you guys out, I was stoked."
00:02:37.615,00:02:40.535,I was stoked as well. And... amped.
00:02:40.952,00:02:45.290,"Yeah. Not just for our country, but my rocket fuel needs customers."
00:02:45.373,00:02:49.836,"And you'll have to forgive me if I sound like a woman on a mission, but I am one."
00:02:55.842,00:02:56.801,Well done.
00:02:57.552,00:02:58.636,"Oh, please."
00:03:03.600,00:03:05.310,I still have my old friends in DC.
00:03:06.811,00:03:08.771,People move on fast at your age.
00:03:12.609,00:03:14.569,"Oh, I'm guessing there was an Al."
00:03:17.363,00:03:18.990,"Most of them died during the war, though."
00:03:20.283,00:03:21.868,That's why there's no more Als.
00:03:22.869,00:03:23.703,Cool.
00:03:26.372,00:03:28.833,"My phone's at one percent, and Mom's in prison."
00:03:28.917,00:03:30.043,"Oh, my gosh."
00:03:30.293,00:03:36.132,"Darling, you've got to keep your phone char-- Great."
00:04:02.742,00:04:03.701,Nice.
00:04:04.452,00:04:05.370,Very...
00:04:06.496,00:04:07.372,very...
00:04:08.414,00:04:09.749,nice.
00:04:29.852,00:04:31.437,Ooh. Fancy.
00:04:32.647,00:04:34.274,"License and registration, miss!"
00:04:36.651,00:04:38.444,"Duncan, you scared the shit out of me!"
00:04:40.238,00:04:42.073,"-Should I get rags or paper towels? -Oh, no."
00:04:42.156,00:04:44.409,"-My mom hates wasting paper towels... -Oh, no, no."
00:04:44.492,00:04:48.079,"...but folks don't sell rags in Colorado-- Oh, just move. Move, move, move!"
00:04:48.162,00:04:49.914,"Just go. Go, go, go!"
00:04:51.332,00:04:58.214,This is a sample of the treatment I recently developed for methicillin-resistant pathogens in space.
00:04:58.298,00:05:02.010,"Bleh. God, that thing. Six months and a bunch of rats over budget."
00:05:02.885,00:05:07.682,"At the biotech arm of Edison Jaymes, it would have taken us half the time and a quarter of the rats."
00:05:08.099,00:05:11.185,"Well, always said we spend way too much money on the rats."
00:05:11.269,00:05:12.854,"Well, it didn't take that long."
00:05:13.396,00:05:16.816,"I did invent a medicine, after all."
00:05:17.233,00:05:19.485,Thank you for signing these NDAs. Standard procedure.
00:05:22.363,00:05:24.240,"You know what an NDA is, don't you, Scarapiducci?"
00:05:24.324,00:05:27.285,So cute. You know what? Ours don't even need to be signed.
00:05:27.368,00:05:30.413,-You sign them just by being here. -Hmm. Never heard of that.
00:05:30.496,00:05:35.001,What you don't know about this place could fill a giant underground silo that you don't even know exists.
00:05:35.084,00:05:36.711,Mm. Is that where they keep your office?
00:05:37.378,00:05:38.212,No.
00:05:43.843,00:05:44.927,Hmm. Let's see.
00:05:45.011,00:05:50.391,I'm an astrobotanist with an advanced degree in cross-pollination and dry terrain root systems.
00:05:50.475,00:05:51.309,What does that mean?
00:05:51.893,00:05:53.811,I know some shit about plants.
00:05:54.103,00:05:55.146,Sorry. Who are you?
00:05:58.316,00:05:59.859,I wanna learn astrobotany.
00:06:00.360,00:06:01.402,For fun.
00:06:01.486,00:06:03.738,"Well, I'm not a science tutor."
00:06:04.113,00:06:05.823,"Well, I'll pay you 50 bucks an hour."
00:06:06.532,00:06:08.659,I could do every day from noon to one.
00:06:11.788,00:06:14.707,"I really don't wanna pay for, like, Hi, how are you, weather bullshit."
00:06:14.791,00:06:18.252,"Cool! I haven't started, and I already wanna quit."
00:06:18.336,00:06:19.921,So glad I made this choice.
00:06:20.004,00:06:20.838,Yeah.
00:06:20.922,00:06:21.756,Me too.
00:06:27.261,00:06:29.305,Which one of these awards means the most to you?
00:06:31.140,00:06:32.141,Bronze Star.
00:06:32.850,00:06:36.896,"I was shot down over Bosnia, survived on worms for six days."
00:06:36.979,00:06:37.814,"Oh, I did that."
00:06:37.897,00:06:39.607,-On an episode of Bear Grylls. -Oh.
00:06:39.690,00:06:41.234,Yeah. Very keto.
00:06:41.651,00:06:42.527,Okay.
00:06:44.362,00:06:48.199,I used a sponge to collect rainwater and store it in plastic bags.
00:06:49.158,00:06:51.035,Where did you get a sponge and plastic bags?
00:06:51.536,00:06:52.578,Piddle pack.
00:06:53.454,00:06:55.373,Pilots use them to relieve themselves.
00:06:56.082,00:06:57.125,Sexually.
00:06:58.334,00:07:01.504,"Mmm, no, no. Like going to the bathroom."
00:07:02.713,00:07:03.840,"Oh, my God."
00:07:05.133,00:07:07.051,"General Mark Naird, do you know what you are?"
00:07:07.135,00:07:08.136,"No, no, no, no."
00:07:09.470,00:07:12.807,I didn't pee on the sponge and then use that same sponge to collect rainwater.
00:07:12.890,00:07:15.560,-That's not my thing. -Right. No. No.
00:07:16.310,00:07:18.521,You are an innovator!
00:07:20.231,00:07:21.232,-You are. -Yeah.
00:07:21.315,00:07:22.442,-Well... -Think about it.
00:07:22.525,00:07:23.818,That was very MacGyver.
00:07:24.235,00:07:26.362,"If that's not innovation, then I don't even know what is."
00:07:26.446,00:07:29.282,I wouldn't really call it innovation. It was just something that I did.
00:07:29.365,00:07:32.535,It was just using the tools -that I had at my disposal. -Come on.
00:07:34.120,00:07:35.580,"I have an idea, from time to time."
00:07:35.663,00:07:41.085,"-I had a feeling. -I am not a tech whiz like you, but I think of some things."
00:07:41.169,00:07:43.588,"-Tell me. Tell me! -No. No, they're silly."
00:07:44.547,00:07:45.465,I wanna hear.
00:07:46.799,00:07:47.758,Okay.
00:07:49.135,00:07:51.512,So you know how people shake hands all over the world?
00:07:51.596,00:07:53.264,-Mm-hmm. -It's a universal thing.
00:07:53.347,00:07:56.684,"It is a sign of respect, decency."
00:07:57.518,00:07:59.562,Yeah. It's a normal human handshake.
00:07:59.645,00:08:05.818,"Exactly. So imagine a device, like a mannequin, with a shakable arm."
00:08:06.235,00:08:09.614,And you put one in Times Square. You put on in Tiananmen Square.
00:08:09.697,00:08:11.991,It's all linked up technologically.
00:08:12.074,00:08:13.701,You've got video screens.
00:08:13.784,00:08:16.454,You can shake the hand of someone in China.
00:08:24.003,00:08:26.631,-Bringing strangers together. -That's exactly right!
00:08:26.797,00:08:28.299,-Mm-hmm. -That's what I've been saying!
00:08:31.552,00:08:32.845,Will that be its name?
00:08:33.679,00:08:34.639,Yes.
00:08:35.056,00:08:36.015,It's good.
00:08:36.390,00:08:39.352,"So-- And inside the booth, there's an attendant."
00:08:39.435,00:08:42.855,That precludes any sort of sexual shenanigans going on.
00:08:42.939,00:08:43.940,Mmm.
00:08:44.023,00:08:47.485,And you don't have to tip the attendant because it's part of the cost of admission.
00:08:47.568,00:08:48.444,It's all covered.
00:08:48.528,00:08:49.403,Okay.
00:08:49.487,00:08:52.406,"It sounds silly when you just say it to people, but it's..."
00:08:52.490,00:08:53.533,"No! No, it does not."
00:08:53.616,00:08:55.952,"Mark, this is your vision."
00:08:56.035,00:08:57.328,I don't want you to shame it.
00:08:59.622,00:09:01.290,and you will change the world.
00:09:02.833,00:09:03.668,Well...
00:09:03.751,00:09:04.669,Oh.
00:09:05.753,00:09:06.796,Wow.
00:09:09.048,00:09:11.217,Okay. We need to get our stories straight.
00:09:11.884,00:09:17.974,The guy who spilled the soft serve was a rich white guy in a Where's Waldo T-shirt.
00:09:18.391,00:09:21.143,"See? That's so specific, people will buy it."
00:09:21.394,00:09:23.479,I don't know. I can't picture it.
00:09:24.230,00:09:26.107,You can't picture people believing it?
00:09:26.190,00:09:27.984,"No, I can't picture what you're describing."
00:09:28.067,00:09:29.694,I don't have that ability.
00:09:31.362,00:09:32.321,Okay.
00:09:32.863,00:09:33.864,Close your eyes.
00:09:35.575,00:09:37.326,Ronald McDonald on a surfboard.
00:09:38.286,00:09:39.203,What do you see?
00:09:39.829,00:09:42.456,Nothing. It's just like staring at a blank page.
00:09:45.376,00:09:47.837,You have no imagination. That's...
00:09:48.546,00:09:49.755,That's adorable.
00:09:50.881,00:09:52.758,"Hey, it's a real condition."
00:09:52.842,00:09:54.176,-Aphantasia. -Oh.
00:09:54.260,00:09:56.512,"Yes. Well, way to sell yourself."
00:09:56.846,00:09:58.681,"So, what are your strengths?"
00:09:58.764,00:10:00.766,"Oh, that is one of my strengths."
00:10:00.850,00:10:02.602,I can stare at a cereal box.
00:10:07.481,00:10:13.362,"I can't wait to talk to you about the nuts and bolts of your fuel, the actual chemistry."
00:10:13.446,00:10:14.864,"Patience, Dr. Mallory."
00:10:14.947,00:10:16.949,I'm about to answer all of your questions.
00:10:17.491,00:10:20.703,"In fact, may I invite you to a little barbecue?"
00:10:28.878,00:10:32.173,"You have to put it in the secure case, which will open again after the demo is over."
00:10:32.256,00:10:33.799,No phones is part of the NDA you signed.
00:10:33.883,00:10:40.931,"Yeah, no, I don't think I'll be doing that, because the last time I handed you my phone, I wasn't allowed within 300 feet of my own fucking office."
00:10:41.015,00:10:43.559,"Are you still holding a grudge? Don't be petulant, Anthony."
00:10:43.643,00:10:45.895,"Don't be petulant, Anthony. You're a goblin."
00:10:47.688,00:10:49.607,-What? What are you doing? -The ankle.
00:10:53.653,00:10:55.321,You are pathetic. Jesus Christ.
00:10:55.946,00:11:05.623,"For generations, chemists have looked to the stars and asked a question: Can a fuel be created that consumes its own exhaust?"
00:11:06.582,00:11:10.044,"Those chemists were men, and the answer was no."
00:11:10.711,00:11:11.962,And then I came along.
00:11:12.338,00:11:16.092,"Ladies and gentlemen, presenting Skinny Fuel..."
00:11:16.759,00:11:23.641,"a rosé colored rocket fuel cheaper, lighter, and cleaner than any fuel ever created."
00:11:24.433,00:11:27.144,I can't help but be impressed.
00:11:27.561,00:11:41.283,"-Thank you. -But it's just that NASA astrochemists have been trying to concoct a solution with the same end result for years, so, what is the molecular structure, and how did you arrive at it?"
00:11:41.367,00:11:42.660,Excellent. Thank you.
00:11:43.327,00:11:50.876,"Edison Jaymes is a publicly traded company, and it would be unfair to our stockholders to share proprietary information."
00:11:50.960,00:11:51.961,However...
00:11:52.628,00:11:54.338,I can demonstrate for you.
00:11:59.927,00:12:01.846,...regular Kingsford lighter fuel.
00:12:05.141,00:12:05.975,And this...
00:12:07.601,00:12:08.811,is Skinny Fuel.
00:12:14.859,00:12:15.693,Thank you.
00:12:18.237,00:12:22.366,"So, why won't she be open about the chemistry?"
00:12:24.285,00:12:25.870,"You're not jealous, are you?"
00:12:25.953,00:12:28.998,Just because she answered the question no male scientist could?
00:12:29.081,00:12:34.670,"Excuse me, Mark, I'm on the board of Cincinnati Women in STEM."
00:12:34.754,00:12:36.672,This is about the science.
00:12:37.506,00:12:39.341,I think she covered it with her presentation.
00:12:40.926,00:12:42.803,She doesn't even need the fuel to work.
00:12:42.887,00:12:51.145,"She can fundraise off the mere fact of having gotten her fuel into a rocket, and then she can always blame us if it all goes sideways."
00:12:51.228,00:12:52.271,This is classic.
00:12:52.354,00:12:56.233,"As soon as somebody thinks that I am smart, you decide that they are dumb."
00:12:57.234,00:12:59.487,"What did you discuss in here, exactly?"
00:12:59.904,00:13:03.115,"Noth-- We just exchanged some ideas, I offered some of mine."
00:13:05.993,00:13:08.412,The pear-grape hybrid?
00:13:22.468,00:13:26.013,"I added an attendant after your feedback, Adrian."
00:13:27.765,00:13:29.892,"Look, I am the one who is in charge here."
00:13:29.975,00:13:32.228,We're going with the Skinny Fuel. That's final.
00:13:32.311,00:13:33.270,Damn it.
00:13:33.646,00:13:35.397,-Adrian. Adrian! Wait. -What?
00:13:38.442,00:13:40.528,My conjugal visit is next week.
00:13:40.903,00:13:43.072,No. You have great ideas. You go.
00:13:43.781,00:13:46.951,"And anyway, they have fantastic fashion consultants."
00:13:47.034,00:13:49.203,They're the ones wearing the red vests.
00:13:54.041,00:13:55.042,I hope I'm not interrupting.
00:13:55.125,00:13:57.753,"No, no, no. just a heated discussion with a colleague."
00:13:58.128,00:14:01.549,"Well, I do know a little bit about fashion, if you'd like another opinion."
00:14:02.508,00:14:03.467,Hmm.
00:14:04.468,00:14:06.095,"Dude, you're late."
00:14:07.429,00:14:09.265,"Okay, I want a discount on my hour."
00:14:09.348,00:14:13.978,"Jesus, for someone who's trying to study botany for fun, you're taking your shit really seriously."
00:14:19.692,00:14:20.901,You wanna be an astronaut?
00:14:20.985,00:14:22.736,"Yeah, what? You think I can't fly a spaceship?"
00:14:22.820,00:14:24.822,"No, I didn't say that. Go fly a spaceship."
00:14:24.905,00:14:27.283,I'm sure you'd be a real calming presence up there.
00:14:27.366,00:14:32.496,The others will love being trapped in a tiny capsule with you in the vacuum of space.
00:14:33.163,00:14:34.915,"Just-- Could we study plants, please?"
00:14:43.132,00:14:44.258,You got a little typo.
00:14:44.341,00:14:46.093,Might wanna fix that before you roll this thing out.
00:14:48.429,00:14:50.598,And there is no I in shirt.
00:14:53.601,00:14:55.436,"So you answered your survey, the six questions?"
00:14:55.519,00:14:56.979,"-Uh, yeah. -Okay."
00:14:57.062,00:14:59.064,Let's see what the algorithm says you should wear.
00:15:11.035,00:15:15.164,I've never... worn anything that purposely showed off my ankles before.
00:15:15.247,00:15:16.248,"Don't you love it, though?"
00:15:16.332,00:15:18.042,"Nah... no, I don't, actually."
00:15:18.125,00:15:19.793,-It looks kind of goofy. -Goofy?
00:15:21.295,00:15:24.089,"Mark, you need to believe in yourself."
00:15:29.803,00:15:32.681,Your wife is going to love this.
00:15:33.432,00:15:35.309,"-Oh, really? -Mmm."
00:15:37.144,00:15:38.103,Okay.
00:15:38.187,00:15:39.271,Okay. You know what?
00:15:39.563,00:15:47.988,"You may be the publicist to a major celebrity, but I am the publicist to man's search for something grander, something that transcends this world."
00:15:50.783,00:15:52.368,What are they even doing in there?
00:15:52.618,00:15:53.869,It's a new venture.
00:15:54.244,00:15:55.579,Blue Apron meets Bonobos.
00:15:55.663,00:15:59.083,The algorithm tells you it loves your pants regardless of how fat your ass looks.
00:15:59.166,00:16:01.669,"She's doing that, and she has a rocket fuel?"
00:16:05.464,00:16:07.675,"'Cause if one thing works, nobody remembers the failures."
00:16:08.926,00:16:11.136,"What do you mean, if one thing works?"
00:16:11.971,00:16:13.097,"I mean, when."
00:16:14.098,00:16:15.808,"Hannah, does the rocket fuel work?"
00:16:16.809,00:16:17.768,Yeah.
00:16:19.395,00:16:20.354,Hannah.
00:16:24.274,00:16:26.485,"Botany's actually, like, pretty self-explanatory."
00:16:26.568,00:16:29.029,Chloroplast and Epidural Stomata.
00:16:29.113,00:16:31.323,"Yeah, these words just define themselves."
00:16:33.701,00:16:34.910,Do you not know Latin?
00:16:39.540,00:16:42.501,"Okay, that's gonna be a little bit of a high-wire act."
00:16:47.131,00:16:48.340,"Okay, you gotta calm down."
00:16:48.424,00:16:51.135,"If we're gonna do this, we're gonna do it my way. Okay?"
00:16:51.218,00:16:52.678,I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat.
00:16:55.806,00:16:57.516,Why don't we just order in and watch Frasier?
00:16:57.599,00:16:59.810,"I have shit to do, bro. Do you see this?"
00:17:00.227,00:17:01.353,"Okay, bro."
00:17:01.437,00:17:04.231,Nice talking to you for the second time in my life.
00:17:05.399,00:17:06.400,"Okay, hey."
00:17:06.483,00:17:07.526,Wait. I'm sorry.
00:17:07.609,00:17:08.527,I'm just...
00:17:10.696,00:17:15.909,"God, saying you want to be an astronaut after age, like, eight, feels very silly."
00:17:20.164,00:17:21.665,I do take you seriously.
00:17:23.751,00:17:27.129,"I mean, maybe not as serious as you take yourself, but that's off the charts."
00:17:27.880,00:17:28.714,Yeah.
00:17:30.758,00:17:32.843,"If you're gonna get a snack, I will take a Rocket Pie."
00:17:32.926,00:17:34.553,"Peanut butter or banana, please."
00:17:36.972,00:17:37.973,Good question.
00:17:38.432,00:17:39.600,Peanu...
00:17:39.683,00:17:41.393,nana...
00:17:41.477,00:17:44.271,butter-peanut-nana-banana.
00:17:44.354,00:17:46.482,"No, coconut or lime."
00:17:47.399,00:17:51.361,"Well, if you die in space, it'll be from murder."
00:17:54.615,00:17:56.158,Mmm. You excited?
00:17:56.241,00:17:57.242,Sure am.
00:18:00.662,00:18:01.747,About the launch?
00:18:01.830,00:18:03.707,You are going to love it.
00:18:04.666,00:18:05.626,Am I?
00:18:07.711,00:18:10.422,"-Oh, my God. What is he doing? -It's me! Can I talk to you?"
00:18:10.506,00:18:13.217,Let's not incinerate my media manager. I'll be right back.
00:18:16.303,00:18:20.307,"Okay, General, I never get involved in whether people are telling the truth or lying."
00:18:20.390,00:18:26.396,"I mean, those words carry very little meaning to me, but something one of Edison's people said, it's got me worried."
00:18:26.814,00:18:27.689,What was that?
00:18:28.690,00:18:29.608,Yeah.
00:18:31.151,00:18:34.196,"Sorry, guess it was more how she said it. I asked, Does the rocket fuel work?"
00:18:34.279,00:18:36.406,"Then she said, Yeah."
00:18:41.703,00:18:42.663,Yeah.
00:18:42.746,00:18:45.040,"Fuck. She said, Yeah."
00:18:46.250,00:18:47.167,It doesn't matter.
00:18:56.844,00:18:58.720,"Hmm. Dr. Mallory, come with me."
00:18:59.388,00:19:01.140,"And, Tony, nicely done."
00:19:05.686,00:19:07.187,"Fuck you, American Apparel."
00:19:07.729,00:19:08.939,What's going on?
00:19:09.022,00:19:10.858,It's a simple scientific formula.
00:19:10.941,00:19:16.113,"When a guy as full of BS as Tony calls BS on someone else, that is BS squared."
00:19:16.196,00:19:21.118,"I wouldn't call it a scientific formula, but, okay."
00:19:23.537,00:19:24.955,Our first crime together.
00:19:26.290,00:19:27.791,May there be many more.
00:19:32.713,00:19:33.922,"So, uh..."
00:19:35.382,00:19:36.341,What...
00:19:36.884,00:19:38.677,what have you been reading lately?
00:19:39.553,00:19:40.470,Excuse me?
00:19:40.888,00:19:42.097,Nothing. Nothing.
00:19:47.269,00:19:50.606,"Duncan, have you been reading to impress me?"
00:19:52.608,00:19:55.027,"But if I had, would you be impressed?"
00:19:55.944,00:19:57.196,I very much...
00:19:58.071,00:19:59.114,might.
00:20:01.408,00:20:02.826,So...
00:20:03.869,00:20:07.122,"that, uh... Denver airport."
00:20:08.665,00:20:11.251,"Well, I read it was two billion dollars over budget."
00:20:11.335,00:20:13.212,"Ooh, I was not aware."
00:20:13.295,00:20:21.136,Yeah. And many believe that the money was used to build underground meeting rooms for those who control the world economy.
00:20:21.970,00:20:23.347,The Illuminati.
00:20:24.556,00:20:25.557,Wait.
00:20:26.308,00:20:27.976,What are you reading?
00:20:28.435,00:20:29.478,Websites.
00:20:31.104,00:20:32.022,Oh.
00:20:34.024,00:20:34.983,Uh...
00:20:35.609,00:20:41.198,"Uh, did you know that the queen of England-- The queen of England is the largest drug pusher in the world?"
00:20:41.615,00:20:42.658,"No, seriously."
00:20:42.741,00:20:45.744,And she killed Jeffrey Epstein with her bare hands.
00:20:45.994,00:20:50.582,And she leaves one of her fingernails real long and has poison on the tip.
00:20:52.167,00:20:53.126,Wow.
00:21:00.008,00:21:07.182,"seven, six, five, four, three, two, one."
00:21:10.227,00:21:11.770,"Okay, so far, so good."
00:21:12.479,00:21:13.355,Fingers crossed.
00:21:13.855,00:21:16.817,Don't worry. I adjusted the fuel ratios.
00:21:16.900,00:21:17.901,Off the books.
00:21:18.777,00:21:20.112,I hope that's all right.
00:21:21.571,00:21:24.741,"Well, how much Skinny Fuel did you end up using?"
00:21:24.825,00:21:26.159,Uh...
00:21:26.243,00:21:27.077,Zero.
00:21:33.792,00:21:34.960,One hundred percent.
00:21:42.801,00:21:45.178,If there's ever anything I can do for you...
00:21:48.974,00:21:51.184,And you can tell him that we're doing just fine.
00:21:51.268,00:21:54.563,We don't need any outside help from the private sector.
00:21:56.064,00:21:57.649,-Something like that. -You got it.
00:21:57.733,00:21:58.692,Okay.
00:22:03.363,00:22:05.032,It's not running on Kingsford.
00:22:06.575,00:22:07.409,Okay.
00:22:07.492,00:22:08.327,Cute.
00:22:10.495,00:22:12.289,"Congratulations, Ms. Jaymes."
00:22:12.372,00:22:17.294,Today you appeared to have a very successful launch with your fuel.
00:22:17.377,00:22:18.295,Thank you.
00:22:22.883,00:22:28.555,"Ah, well, perhaps the breath refreshment sector is where you should redirect your efforts."
00:22:28.638,00:22:31.308,That feels a bit more feasible for you.
00:22:31.391,00:22:32.309,Hmm.
00:22:33.393,00:22:35.562,"If you ever get big and powerful one day, come see me."
00:22:35.645,00:22:37.564,I might have an extremely low-level position for you.
00:22:37.647,00:22:42.027,Or maybe one day you'll be big and powerful enough -for me to take you seriously. -Maybe we'll both be big and powerful.
00:22:42.110,00:22:43.070,Maybe we will.
00:22:54.373,00:22:55.332,Fuck!
00:23:13.100,00:23:13.975,So...
00:23:14.726,00:23:15.936,what do you make...
00:23:17.604,00:23:18.605,of this one?
00:23:18.855,00:23:20.482,Oh. It's brown.
00:23:20.565,00:23:21.983,Brown doesn't go with anything.
00:23:22.067,00:23:25.195,"Oh, there are things that go with brown, I'm sure."
00:23:25.529,00:23:26.446,Oh.
00:23:28.073,00:23:29.449,Thank God I have you.
00:23:31.243,00:23:33.078,That's a very nice thing to say.
00:23:33.954,00:23:36.081,"-Oh, I like that. -That one? Pretty."
00:23:40.168,00:23:41.044,Yeah?
00:23:41.503,00:23:45.757,The Prospector Satellite is now in orbit around the moon.
00:23:45.841,00:23:48.301,Good! Is the camera transmitting yet?
00:23:48.385,00:23:51.012,"Yes, sir. Uh, we have our first images."
00:23:51.096,00:23:52.347,Very good.
00:23:52.806,00:23:55.016,"Oh, excellent."
00:23:56.101,00:23:58.353,"Oh, that's a beautiful shot."
00:24:05.610,00:24:08.822,Oh... We're not 100 percent sure what that is yet.
00:24:12.617,00:24:14.077,The Chinese flag.
00:24:16.121,00:24:17.747,-Oh. -What?
00:24:18.248,00:24:19.583,-Did-- Did you-- -Oh!
00:24:19.666,00:24:21.460,Wow! Look at that!
00:24:22.043,00:24:24.254,I had no idea they were that far along.
00:24:24.337,00:24:26.465,-That's something. -Huh.
00:24:26.548,00:24:28.592,"Oh, good for them!"
00:24:34.097,00:24:36.683,"Oh, I am happy for them."
00:24:37.225,00:24:38.685,They really are there.
00:24:38.768,00:24:39.978,Look at that.
00:24:43.106,00:24:45.233,"Oh, shit!"
00:24:45.775,00:24:49.070,Those Chinese bastards did it.
00:24:49.696,00:24:50.906,They did it!
00:24:51.698,00:24:54.493,Ha! That is rich.
