00:01:58.750,00:01:59.833,Violet Markey?
00:02:02.375,00:02:03.458,"Oh, my God."
00:02:10.583,00:02:11.583,Please go.
00:02:13.083,00:02:15.250,"-Well, I don't think that's very-- -Just go!"
00:02:33.041,00:02:34.166,I asked you first.
00:02:38.125,00:02:39.666,This is higher than I thought.
00:02:44.666,00:02:45.500,Hey.
00:02:46.708,00:02:47.708,"Hey, look."
00:02:48.625,00:02:49.791,Look what I can do.
00:02:51.791,00:02:53.541,Stop. Stop!
00:03:05.166,00:03:06.166,"Hey, Violet."
00:04:04.750,00:04:07.875,Hey. Do you have plans this weekend? My parents are gonna be out of town.
00:04:07.958,00:04:10.375,I was thinking about having a party or something.
00:04:16.541,00:04:17.416,Violet?
00:04:18.791,00:04:19.625,You OK?
00:04:26.208,00:04:27.916,Everything is a really big word.
00:04:31.458,00:04:34.166,Emotionally? Those both could encompass everything.
00:04:34.250,00:04:36.083,Or is everything encompassed by both things?
00:04:36.166,00:04:37.916,Are you feeling overwhelmed by anything?
00:04:38.000,00:04:42.125,"If everything is encompassed by both things, are they a part of our reality, or are they somewhere else?"
00:04:42.208,00:04:43.666,"This isn't funny, Theodore."
00:04:45.416,00:04:46.250,Finch.
00:04:47.625,00:04:49.791,I need you to take these meetings seriously.
00:04:49.875,00:04:50.875,I get it.
00:04:51.583,00:04:56.541,"OK, do you get that you're on probation, and in danger of not graduating?"
00:04:58.750,00:05:01.333,You've already missed two weeks of school this year.
00:05:01.958,00:05:03.000,"Yeah, um..."
00:05:04.416,00:05:06.125,-my grandma-- -Stop one second.
00:05:06.208,00:05:07.916,I just wanna clarify real quickly.
00:05:08.000,00:05:11.125,Is this the grandma who's died four times over the past three years?
00:05:12.000,00:05:13.333,"Five times, actually."
00:05:14.083,00:05:15.166,This is the fifth.
00:05:18.625,00:05:19.875,She's our miracle.
00:05:21.750,00:05:25.000,"I really wanna help you, but you've gotta take this seriously."
00:05:26.291,00:05:33.375,"I mean, you agreed to these terms, these weekly counseling sessions, maintaining a B-average, extracurricular participation."
00:05:33.458,00:05:35.500,And I am loving pottery.
00:05:36.125,00:05:37.125,"Come on, man."
00:05:37.583,00:05:38.708,"Look, I get it."
00:05:38.791,00:05:40.916,"If I screw anything up, I'm out."
00:05:41.666,00:05:43.541,"We're not askin' a lot of you, Finch."
00:05:45.083,00:05:46.375,You just need to show up.
00:05:50.541,00:05:52.125,"but it's not like that matters, anyway."
00:05:52.208,00:05:54.125,"I mean, I know I'm gonna get in."
00:05:56.333,00:05:57.916,Did you apply anywhere yet?
00:05:59.208,00:06:01.083,-Hey. -Hi.
00:06:01.625,00:06:03.875,"So, you going to Amanda's party?"
00:06:07.125,00:06:08.208,So I've heard.
00:06:08.625,00:06:10.625,"It couldn't hurt to have a little fun, right?"
00:06:11.208,00:06:15.125,"Yo, do you think it'd be weird if I named my kid after a famous person?"
00:06:15.208,00:06:21.416,"Like, if I named him Danny DeVito Donahue, do you... do you think he'd be mad about it?"
00:06:22.375,00:06:23.875,Is DeVito the middle name?
00:06:24.458,00:06:25.333,Yeah.
00:06:25.875,00:06:27.875,Follow-up question: how high are you right now?
00:06:29.500,00:06:33.250,"On the scale, I'd probably say very... this way."
00:06:37.083,00:06:38.458,What are you looking at?
00:06:39.000,00:06:42.250,Just admiring the social norms of teenage angst.
00:06:42.833,00:06:45.041,-Are you looking at Violet Markey? -Yep.
00:06:46.250,00:06:47.083,"Her, um..."
00:06:48.250,00:06:49.458,"her sister died, right?"
00:06:50.458,00:06:51.333,"Yeah, dude."
00:06:51.416,00:06:52.291,Hm.
00:06:53.083,00:06:54.625,Why ask about her all of a sudden?
00:06:54.708,00:06:56.208,I'm intrigued. A guy can't be intrigued?
00:06:56.291,00:06:59.541,"Well, a guy can be intrigued. You being intrigued is weird."
00:07:03.166,00:07:04.333,I wouldn't say weird.
00:07:04.416,00:07:06.500,"Wait, if you don't think you're weird, well..."
00:07:25.541,00:07:29.458,"His name's Embry. I call him Embryo. It's the little things, Kate."
00:07:29.541,00:07:31.625,Did you do something I should be worried about?
00:07:31.708,00:07:34.375,I'm genuinely offended by that supposition.
00:07:34.916,00:07:36.250,-Finch. -No.
00:07:37.000,00:07:38.500,It's fine. I'll deal with it.
00:07:40.833,00:07:44.083,Because what you really mean is that I'm gonna have to deal with it.
00:07:46.500,00:07:47.708,Did you cut class again?
00:07:47.791,00:07:52.208,"No! For fuck's sake, just go hang out with Tina or whatever it is you do."
00:07:52.291,00:07:53.166,I'm fine.
00:07:54.083,00:07:57.333,OK. I'm gonna be home late. There's food in the fridge.
00:07:57.416,00:07:59.125,"-Mm-hmm. -Real food, Finch."
00:07:59.833,00:08:00.708,Where's Mom?
00:08:00.791,00:08:03.041,She had to go to Chicago for business. Remember?
00:08:03.125,00:08:05.291,"-Oh, yeah, right. Cool. -Love you."
00:08:10.583,00:08:11.833,-Love you. -Love you.
00:08:28.208,00:08:29.666,I'm gonna get the dessert.
00:08:39.708,00:08:41.833,And it wasn't easy for us either.
00:09:05.875,00:09:07.625,I've been making it for 19 years.
00:11:13.750,00:11:20.375,"and leaving us at the end of the year, I feel an obligation to make sure you see the wondrous sights of Indiana while you can."
00:11:20.458,00:11:23.458,"To wander them, if you will."
00:11:24.458,00:11:28.791,"For your class project, you must report on two or more wonders of Indiana."
00:11:28.875,00:11:35.458,"You will write about them, explain their significance to you and to Indiana, and why you chose to visit them."
00:11:36.125,00:11:38.250,I want you to take time on this assignment.
00:11:38.333,00:11:39.500,Be thoughtful.
00:11:44.958,00:11:45.958,What just happened?
00:11:46.750,00:11:47.958,That was so weird.
00:11:49.583,00:11:50.625,"Violet, are you OK?"
00:11:51.708,00:11:54.541,"All right, let's take our seats. Let's focus up."
00:11:55.166,00:11:56.916,"If you're done, Mr. Finch?"
00:11:57.000,00:12:01.041,"Yes, I am done, and can I just say you are doing a fine job teaching this class."
00:12:01.125,00:12:03.125,My young brain is plump with knowledge.
00:12:08.250,00:12:11.958,"you'll be taking photos, doing some drawings, capturing detail."
00:12:12.041,00:12:14.750,You will be doing this in teams of two.
00:12:16.041,00:12:17.458,Can we choose our partners?
00:12:17.875,00:12:19.000,"Yes, Mr. Finch."
00:12:21.958,00:12:22.791,Hey.
00:12:25.916,00:12:26.916,"So, um..."
00:12:27.958,00:12:31.500,do you think that there's such a thing as a perfect day?
00:12:32.791,00:12:34.875,I'm the last person you should be asking.
00:13:01.458,00:13:07.291,"this teacher wants us to do this project with a partner, and I just don't wanna do it."
00:13:07.708,00:13:10.125,"Well, did you ask for an alternate project?"
00:13:10.875,00:13:12.750,"Yeah, he just... he wouldn't listen."
00:13:13.583,00:13:15.250,"Well, maybe it's time to get back out there."
00:13:15.750,00:13:17.333,That's the same thing he said.
00:13:19.958,00:13:21.166,I know it's hard.
00:13:22.666,00:13:25.333,-But you just don't go out anymore. -That's not true.
00:13:25.416,00:13:27.791,When's the last time you hung out with your friends?
00:13:29.250,00:13:32.583,I think it would be really good if you'd spend some time with them.
00:13:34.166,00:13:37.625,"So, if I hung out with my friends, you'd get me outta this assignment?"
00:13:52.458,00:13:53.375,Violet!
00:14:00.416,00:14:03.166,-I'm gonna get a drink. Do you want one? -I'm good.
00:14:03.250,00:14:04.625,"Come on, babe."
00:14:05.166,00:14:06.125,OK.
00:14:47.041,00:14:47.875,Yeah...
00:14:58.416,00:14:59.500,Hey.
00:15:01.125,00:15:02.458,That's a heavy pour.
00:15:03.083,00:15:04.708,You know me. I love to rage.
00:15:10.291,00:15:12.708,"I think I'm gonna leave pretty soon, actually."
00:15:13.375,00:15:16.125,"Really? But... I mean, I just got here."
00:15:17.458,00:15:19.500,"It's just all a little much, you know?"
00:15:21.208,00:15:23.458,How much longer are you gonna act like this?
00:15:25.125,00:15:27.625,It's been months. When are you gonna just...
00:15:32.750,00:15:33.666,Nice.
00:15:35.666,00:15:38.416,"Violet, you know I didn't mean it like that. Just..."
00:16:01.500,00:16:02.708,Please call to confirm.
00:16:03.166,00:16:05.791,765-276-8504.
00:16:31.708,00:16:32.833,Theodore Finch speaking.
00:16:32.916,00:16:34.166,Take it down now.
00:16:36.708,00:16:41.000,"The video will self-destruct in three, two..."
00:16:42.291,00:16:43.291,...please refresh.
00:16:46.541,00:16:47.708,Why would you do that?
00:16:48.125,00:16:49.750,I wanna talk about the bridge.
00:17:00.416,00:17:03.166,One morning barely qualifies as a terrible time.
00:17:03.541,00:17:04.833,It's a quote.
00:17:05.750,00:17:06.833,Virginia Woolf.
00:17:08.791,00:17:09.666,OK.
00:17:11.208,00:17:12.208,Can I come over?
00:17:15.291,00:17:16.375,Yeah.
00:17:26.500,00:17:28.375,So...
00:17:29.333,00:17:31.000,I Googled you.
00:17:33.958,00:17:35.333,You Googled me?
00:17:37.750,00:17:39.625,"Yeah, what's with that..."
00:17:40.250,00:17:43.125,the website that you have with your sister?
00:17:44.958,00:17:45.875,Had.
00:17:50.458,00:17:52.541,I read some of your stuff. It's really good.
00:17:53.875,00:17:55.125,I don't write anymore.
00:17:58.583,00:18:01.791,"So, you moved here from California."
00:18:04.333,00:18:05.333,How was that?
00:18:06.666,00:18:08.166,California to Indiana?
00:18:09.125,00:18:10.416,Must've been different.
00:18:12.125,00:18:12.958,Yeah.
00:18:23.375,00:18:25.125,I didn't know that it happened there.
00:18:26.500,00:18:27.750,At the bridge.
00:18:31.083,00:18:32.708,"I'm not, you know..."
00:18:35.583,00:18:36.916,Suicidal?
00:18:37.791,00:18:38.791,You can say it.
00:18:39.500,00:18:40.500,"Well, I'm not."
00:18:42.458,00:18:45.208,"Whatever you are, I saved your life."
00:18:48.083,00:18:49.250,"No, you didn't."
00:18:50.666,00:18:52.833,You're making a big deal out of nothing.
00:18:53.416,00:18:55.625,Mm... kinda looked like somethin'.
00:18:58.250,00:18:59.708,What do you want from me?
00:19:00.875,00:19:03.875,I was just thinkin' that we should be partners.
00:19:04.583,00:19:06.041,For the wandering project.
00:19:06.750,00:19:09.083,I think it would be good for you to get out.
00:19:10.125,00:19:11.541,Maybe I don't wanna get out.
00:19:12.625,00:19:14.125,Maybe I'm sick of people.
00:19:17.041,00:19:18.583,"Yeah, people are stupid."
00:19:19.416,00:19:24.416,But the tiniest few might actually mean well.
00:19:26.083,00:19:28.375,"Why do you wanna do this with me, anyway?"
00:19:29.833,00:19:32.625,Because there are places that need to be seen.
00:19:33.333,00:19:37.750,Maybe even the smallest of places can mean something.
00:19:37.875,00:19:42.166,"At the very least, maybe they can mean something to us."
00:19:42.250,00:19:43.333,Not an us.
00:19:44.666,00:19:48.625,Maybe they can mean something to you and me.
00:19:48.708,00:19:51.166,"Jesus, they call me anti-social."
00:19:51.708,00:19:54.291,Two wanders. That's all.
00:19:55.583,00:19:57.583,We can do more if you end up loving it.
00:19:57.666,00:19:58.666,I won't.
00:20:07.583,00:20:10.875,"Oh, I found another quote for you."
00:20:14.083,00:20:17.291,I feel a thousand capacities spring up in me.
00:20:18.458,00:20:21.750,The Waves. It's from The Waves.
00:20:23.083,00:20:26.708,You've got at least a thousand capacities in you.
00:20:28.625,00:20:30.083,Even if you don't think so.
00:20:33.750,00:20:35.250,You can keep that one.
00:20:44.875,00:20:47.250,"You know people call you The Freak, right?"
00:20:49.291,00:20:50.166,Yeah.
00:20:51.416,00:20:55.916,"Sometimes I say and do things without thinking, and..."
00:20:57.041,00:21:00.083,"people don't like that, people like labels."
00:21:00.166,00:21:01.583,They like putting you in a box.
00:21:01.666,00:21:04.291,They want you to be who they want you to be.
00:21:07.666,00:21:09.250,People don't like messy.
00:21:10.583,00:21:11.583,Or different.
00:21:16.333,00:21:21.166,"My parents are calling Hudson to get me outta the project, so you need to find another partner."
00:21:24.416,00:21:25.333,OK.
00:21:29.625,00:21:32.208,"Good night, Violet Markey."
00:21:33.291,00:21:34.291,Good night...
00:21:36.041,00:21:37.333,Theodore Finch.
00:22:06.416,00:22:07.333,Violet.
00:22:08.958,00:22:10.125,"Hey, where you going?"
00:22:11.083,00:22:11.958,Home.
00:22:12.708,00:22:14.083,How'd it go with Hudson?
00:22:15.833,00:22:16.833,Not great.
00:22:17.458,00:22:18.416,Yeah.
00:22:19.000,00:22:21.541,He feels pretty strongly about participation.
00:22:28.416,00:22:29.333,OK...
00:22:32.166,00:22:33.541,but no cars.
00:22:34.958,00:22:36.125,Come again?
00:22:36.208,00:22:40.958,"If you wanna do this with me, you have to figure out another way because I'm not getting in a car."
00:23:11.791,00:23:14.000,Where would you go if you could go anywhere?
00:23:22.416,00:23:24.791,It's warm and it never snows.
00:23:38.958,00:23:40.208,Undiscovered.
00:23:40.291,00:23:41.291,Untouched.
00:23:42.375,00:23:44.583,You could come... if you want.
00:23:56.500,00:23:57.541,That's it?
00:24:04.083,00:24:05.583,"Get on up here, Ultraviolet."
00:24:05.666,00:24:06.500,No.
00:24:06.958,00:24:08.125,Come on.
00:24:09.125,00:24:10.958,Come on. The view is incredible.
00:24:15.333,00:24:16.333,Come on.
00:24:31.666,00:24:33.500,The highest point in Indiana.
00:24:35.583,00:24:40.833,"I think if I were here for literally any other reason than why you and I are here, I'd be pissed."
00:24:42.166,00:24:45.083,"Oh, wow. Is that a sense of humor you're hiding in there?"
00:24:48.833,00:24:51.750,This is the lamest thing I think I've ever seen.
00:25:03.708,00:25:06.750,"It's OK, you know? You're not going to hell for laughing."
00:25:16.791,00:25:18.416,It was my sister's birthday.
00:25:21.333,00:25:22.791,She would've been 19.
00:25:25.291,00:25:26.958,That's why I was at the bridge.
00:25:33.791,00:25:34.958,Why were you there?
00:25:38.750,00:25:39.916,I like to run.
00:25:43.083,00:25:44.833,It's pretty early to run.
00:25:44.916,00:25:45.916,Yeah.
00:25:50.916,00:25:51.916,Let's jump.
00:25:54.333,00:25:55.333,You with me?
00:25:59.291,00:26:00.458,"All right, on three."
00:26:02.041,00:26:03.125,You gotta get ready.
00:26:03.208,00:26:07.333,"One... there it is, two, three."
00:26:10.708,00:26:11.875,Wow.
00:26:15.625,00:26:18.125,These are the things we leave behind.
00:26:18.875,00:26:19.791,Pick one.
00:26:22.916,00:26:24.083,Not that one.
00:26:25.500,00:26:26.958,Yeah. That's a good choice.
00:26:43.166,00:26:45.166,-What? -You didn't know?
00:26:46.000,00:26:48.083,This is a motherfucking staring contest.
00:26:49.416,00:26:50.583,You can't be serious.
00:26:51.000,00:26:52.833,Look at my face. I'm really serious.
00:26:54.791,00:26:55.708,Fine.
00:26:56.708,00:26:58.000,I'm very competitive.
00:26:58.083,00:26:59.083,Me too.
00:27:45.333,00:27:47.083,I'm staying over at Tina's tonight.
00:27:48.291,00:27:49.166,OK.
00:27:50.958,00:27:51.875,OK?
00:27:53.208,00:27:54.041,Yeah.
00:27:56.500,00:28:00.708,"Usually, that incites a diatribe -about how Tina's an asshole... -Diatribe. Good word."
00:28:00.791,00:28:02.833,...and how I shouldn't spend so much time with her.
00:28:04.000,00:28:10.083,"Yeah, well, it appears that my many rantings on this topic have stuck with you, and I don't have to preach anymore."
00:28:10.791,00:28:12.041,What's going on with you?
00:28:13.875,00:28:14.833,Nothing.
00:28:16.250,00:28:17.375,"You seem, like..."
00:28:18.833,00:28:19.750,goofy.
00:28:23.750,00:28:24.916,You're goofy.
00:29:27.166,00:29:28.500,than men are to women?
00:29:47.166,00:29:52.333,"always buzzing, humming, soaring, roaring, diving, and then buried in mud."
00:29:53.083,00:29:54.250,And why?
00:29:54.333,00:29:55.958,What's this passion for?
00:30:11.625,00:30:14.166,you cannot tell it about other people.
00:33:42.500,00:33:44.833,She was bossy... like you.
00:33:47.125,00:33:48.333,I like her already.
00:33:52.250,00:33:53.708,She hated reading.
00:33:56.666,00:34:01.333,"She only liked this Italian poet, Cesare Pavese."
00:34:02.583,00:34:07.166,"He said, We do not remember days, we remember moments."
00:34:10.250,00:34:15.208,"Any time I was having a bad day, she always said that."
00:34:15.291,00:34:17.500,Like it was supposed to fix something.
00:34:18.625,00:34:19.583,Did it?
00:34:21.750,00:34:22.666,Yeah.
00:34:23.666,00:34:24.625,It did.
00:34:27.666,00:34:28.666,What else?
00:34:34.291,00:34:35.750,She was my best friend.
00:34:42.083,00:34:43.375,Eleanor Markey.
00:34:44.625,00:34:45.708,Sister...
00:34:47.250,00:34:48.250,best friend.
00:34:52.250,00:34:53.625,That's a pretty good epitaph.
00:34:57.625,00:34:58.750,What would yours be?
00:35:02.958,00:35:04.166,Violet Markey.
00:35:06.583,00:35:07.583,I was here.
00:35:11.916,00:35:14.708,"Yeah, I'm gonna have to steal that one from you."
00:35:23.625,00:35:25.000,You making pancakes?
00:35:30.583,00:35:31.875,Lookin' pretty good.
00:35:56.583,00:35:58.375,-Hey. -Hi.
00:36:00.708,00:36:03.375,"You're not mad that I'm doing that project with Roamer, right?"
00:36:03.833,00:36:04.666,No.
00:36:04.750,00:36:06.875,"OK, cool. 'Cause it's, like, it's not a thing."
00:36:06.958,00:36:09.083,"No, it's fine. I'm doing it with Finch."
00:36:09.625,00:36:10.500,With Finch?
00:36:11.000,00:36:11.875,Yeah.
00:36:13.708,00:36:16.625,"You know that he's, like, kinda dangerous?"
00:36:17.708,00:36:18.916,"No, he's not."
00:36:20.083,00:36:24.375,"He freaked out last year and threw a chair at Roamer, like, in the middle of class."
00:36:25.666,00:36:26.583,He did?
00:36:43.958,00:36:52.125,"So, I was thinking we should check out the Shoe Tree or the abandoned drive-in, depending on whatever you're feeling."
00:36:54.125,00:36:55.291,What is this?
00:36:55.708,00:37:00.666,"That's a reminder that sooner or later, you're gonna have to get back into the world all by yourself."
00:37:01.083,00:37:02.875,But I'm happy pushing you for now.
00:37:04.958,00:37:08.041,"Well, I said I was only gonna do two, so..."
00:37:12.166,00:37:14.083,I prefer Private Violet to...
00:37:14.875,00:37:15.875,Public Violet.
00:37:15.958,00:37:17.250,Can you put her on?
00:37:17.333,00:37:18.166,I'll wait.
00:37:22.625,00:37:25.125,"Nice sweater. What's that, a cotton blend?"
00:37:26.875,00:37:30.458,People think this whole freak thing is an act. I know it's real.
00:37:33.958,00:37:35.000,Of course it is.
00:37:42.166,00:37:43.208,How are things?
00:37:44.041,00:37:46.625,Just your average teenage melodrama.
00:37:47.625,00:37:49.708,Come on. You gotta give me more than that.
00:37:51.750,00:37:53.875,People are always telling me what I am.
00:37:54.458,00:37:55.458,A freak.
00:37:56.375,00:37:57.375,I get it.
00:37:58.000,00:38:00.333,Doesn't mean it doesn't piss me off sometimes.
00:38:08.916,00:38:09.916,"Come on, man."
00:38:10.458,00:38:12.458,Come on. Help me out here. Come on. Help me out.
00:38:18.583,00:38:20.458,Maybe if...
00:38:21.333,00:38:25.625,"you got a fainting couch, you could put it right over there."
00:38:25.708,00:38:28.625,It would really give me the mise en scène that I was looking for.
00:38:29.291,00:38:30.625,Tie the whole room together.
00:38:30.708,00:38:33.250,Did you look into that support group I told you to check out?
00:38:33.333,00:38:35.708,I might've lost the info on that one.
00:38:35.791,00:38:38.208,"Come on, Theodore. It's a small ask, man."
00:38:44.125,00:38:46.416,-It's called Fresh Approach... -Ooh!
00:38:46.500,00:38:52.291,"...and it is confidential, so you can say whatever you want about anything that's bothering you."
00:38:53.250,00:38:56.875,"It is a safe space, Finch."
00:38:57.333,00:38:58.833,I want you to think about it.
00:39:05.166,00:39:07.000,What now? Now what are we doing? What?
00:39:07.083,00:39:08.375,What's happenin'?
00:39:08.458,00:39:09.500,Is this a knock-off?
00:39:09.583,00:39:10.916,The Post-it?
00:39:11.541,00:39:13.625,-This is off-brand. -Please leave now.
00:39:54.708,00:39:56.250,What are you looking at?
00:39:59.000,00:40:00.541,There's a kid on my lawn.
00:40:26.875,00:40:28.041,Wake up.
00:40:31.125,00:40:31.958,Hey.
00:40:32.833,00:40:34.250,Did you sleep out here?
00:40:35.750,00:40:36.625,Yeah.
00:40:40.458,00:40:51.208,"I know you said that you were done, but what if I told you that I found the best wander in the state of Indiana, possibly the world, but..."
00:40:53.125,00:40:54.500,it was 160 miles away?
00:40:55.375,00:40:58.291,"I'd say have fun, and I can't wait to hear all about it."
00:40:58.833,00:41:01.750,Come on! Just give it a chance.
00:41:01.833,00:41:03.791,"-At least sit inside. -No, Finch."
00:41:03.875,00:41:05.208,I'm not getting in a car!
00:41:05.291,00:41:07.291,"Look, here. I'll take the keys, and..."
00:41:10.666,00:41:15.666,I swear not to drive faster than 30 miles per hour through town or 50 on the interstate.
00:41:16.625,00:41:18.833,"If at any time you wanna stop, we stop."
00:41:19.666,00:41:21.625,You can't keep pushing people.
00:41:21.708,00:41:25.833,You don't listen. We did it. The project is over. This is over.
00:41:26.291,00:41:28.791,You know this isn't about a class assignment.
00:41:29.541,00:41:35.416,"This is about you being holed up in your room or on your stupid bike, always circling the same three-mile radius."
00:41:35.500,00:41:38.416,"And God forbid anyone risk upsetting Poor Violet, but..."
00:41:43.916,00:41:45.250,Is everything OK out here?
00:41:45.333,00:41:46.666,-Fine. -Hey.
00:41:46.750,00:41:51.041,"Sorry. Hey. Hi, I'm Theodore Finch. Pleasure to meet you both."
00:41:51.125,00:41:54.500,"-Little early, don't you think, Theodore? -Yes. Yes, it is early."
00:41:54.583,00:41:56.000,That is a fair observation.
00:41:56.083,00:42:01.375,"But you see, I'm your daughter's partner for the school project, and we really need to get to this place."
00:42:03.291,00:42:05.416,"Basically, I need her to get into the car."
00:42:05.500,00:42:06.625,That car.
00:42:07.625,00:42:14.208,"That is extremely safe, insured, with an experienced driver who hasn't gotten so much as a speeding ticket."
00:42:14.291,00:42:15.708,This is for a school project?
00:42:19.958,00:42:23.583,"Well, Theodore, I think it's Violet's decision to make, but..."
00:42:25.083,00:42:26.583,maybe not a bad idea.
00:42:39.666,00:42:41.375,You think she's coming back?
00:42:41.458,00:42:44.083,"Hey, your guess is as good as ours."
00:42:57.291,00:42:58.541,"No, wait. No."
00:43:02.250,00:43:05.708,"OK. If I were keys, where would I hide?"
00:43:15.375,00:43:16.833,How are we doin' over there?
00:43:16.916,00:43:17.833,Fine.
00:43:18.416,00:43:19.333,You sure?
00:43:19.416,00:43:21.750,Just stop asking me. You're making it worse.
00:43:22.541,00:43:23.958,Talk about something else.
00:43:24.791,00:43:26.875,"Usually, that is my forte."
00:43:26.958,00:43:29.125,"But right now, I got nothin'."
00:43:49.916,00:43:51.166,It's a good song.
00:44:43.500,00:44:46.083,I don't remember how fast we were going.
00:44:46.375,00:44:48.250,It didn't seem fast.
00:44:55.666,00:44:57.083,Then we were sliding...
00:45:03.708,00:45:06.291,"and Eleanor was saying, I can't hold on."
00:45:10.666,00:45:13.291,And then the car slammed into the bridge.
00:45:24.208,00:45:25.541,I just remember the...
00:45:25.625,00:45:29.750,the glass hitting my face and Eleanor screaming.
00:45:35.416,00:45:36.291,Then...
00:45:37.375,00:45:39.500,"after that, it just all goes blank."
00:45:47.250,00:45:53.250,"When I woke up in the hospital, my mom told me she was gone."
00:46:00.958,00:46:02.291,And that was it.
00:47:19.708,00:47:21.291,Still mad you got in the car?
00:47:42.958,00:47:43.875,That's impressive.
00:47:57.250,00:47:58.833,I can see my house from here.
00:48:22.791,00:48:24.125,Did it feel fast?
00:48:27.750,00:48:28.750,Are you ready?
00:48:30.125,00:48:32.250,All right. Here we go. You ready?
00:48:32.333,00:48:33.375,"Oh, my God."
00:49:05.875,00:49:07.375,"Oh, my God!"
00:49:10.416,00:49:11.833,I wanna go again.
00:50:17.833,00:50:20.041,I got you somethin'. It's in the door.
00:50:24.291,00:50:29.291,"That, Ultraviolet, is a special place that I'm gonna take you to one day."
00:50:30.791,00:50:31.791,"Oh, yeah?"
00:50:32.541,00:50:35.833,"Yeah, but you're gonna need to start pullin' your weight, OK?"
00:50:35.916,00:50:36.958,I got you this...
00:50:37.541,00:50:42.458,"just in case you've forgotten this is a school project, you have to write about it."
00:50:43.250,00:50:44.291,Just me?
00:50:44.750,00:50:45.916,You're the writer.
00:50:54.750,00:50:56.500,No. You gotta start with Hoosier Hill.
00:50:56.583,00:50:58.583,"You know, you don't have to be so pushy."
00:50:58.666,00:51:00.708,"You say pushy, and I hear, um..."
00:51:01.208,00:51:05.375,"assertive, bold, inspiring."
00:51:06.666,00:51:08.791,Uh... relentless. Irritating.
00:51:11.000,00:51:12.041,Sexy.
00:51:18.875,00:51:20.666,It's nice to have a friend again.
00:51:27.416,00:51:29.083,Don't let that go to your head.
00:51:31.458,00:51:32.458,Too late.
00:51:40.416,00:51:42.625,"You know what I like about you, Ultraviolet?"
00:51:44.291,00:51:45.291,What?
00:55:31.708,00:55:35.458,"Before we get started, we are nearing D-Day, people."
00:55:36.958,00:55:39.166,The day to present your wanderings.
00:55:39.250,00:55:40.250,That is correct.
00:55:40.333,00:55:46.916,"Along with your essay, I'm going to be asking each group to do a presentation to the whole class."
00:55:47.000,00:55:51.916,"But today, we're talking about the five themes of geography: location, place..."
00:56:01.333,00:56:04.583,"No, but honestly, I wouldn't even worry about it."
00:56:07.416,00:56:10.958,"I've texted him for the past couple days, and he hasn't responded."
00:56:13.041,00:56:17.833,"...I mean, sometimes he's gone for a day, like, maybe two, but he always turns up."
00:56:21.041,00:56:25.416,"-Oh, my God. -He came back and said he went camping, and he had all these poison ivy spots on him..."
00:56:25.500,00:56:27.750,"-Covered in spots. -...itching, it was like... yeah."
00:56:29.791,00:56:31.291,I think it's pretty fucked up.
00:56:32.583,00:56:34.750,It's easy to pick up your phone and respond.
00:56:34.833,00:56:40.041,"It's... that's just something you have to deal with if you wanna be close with him, you know?"
00:56:40.458,00:56:41.833,It just makes me mad.
00:56:44.333,00:56:46.833,"Yeah. So, we've been to a lot of really interesting places so far."
00:56:48.708,00:56:50.875,or you've just kind of been shooting from the hip?
00:56:50.958,00:57:00.333,"Honestly? I'm just trying to distract her into spending as much time with me Yeah, I think so. I've been really..."
00:57:04.083,00:57:04.958,Hey.
00:57:06.541,00:57:09.083,Did you lose your phone? I've been texting. I've been calling.
00:57:09.166,00:57:11.333,"Look, let me just show you this really fast. Hold on."
00:57:11.500,00:57:13.916,-You could've taken a second to respond... -I know.
00:57:14.000,00:57:16.541,-...so I knew you were OK. -I had to take care of a couple things.
00:57:37.666,00:57:42.458,"In the '50s, a group of boys went swimming here, and they disappeared."
00:57:42.541,00:57:44.125,No one ever found their bodies.
00:57:48.791,00:57:49.750,maybe.
00:57:51.708,00:57:54.041,Or maybe they found the other side.
00:57:55.458,00:58:00.958,They say there's a force in the middle that sucks you into an underground river and leads you to another world.
00:58:07.500,00:58:08.875,You're not going in?
00:58:09.833,00:58:11.041,"Oh, of course I am."
00:58:12.208,00:58:13.958,It'll be freezing.
00:58:14.041,00:58:15.208,It'll be fine.
00:58:19.958,00:58:20.958,You should come in.
00:58:24.666,00:58:26.958,"-No, I'm good. -What are you afraid of?"
00:58:28.166,00:58:33.916,-It's cold. -Serious question: what are you most afraid of?
00:58:38.000,00:58:39.000,Dying.
00:58:40.625,00:58:41.750,I don't believe that.
00:58:44.583,00:58:45.833,Being ordinary.
01:00:11.375,01:00:12.791,-Yeah? -OK.
01:00:12.875,01:00:15.625,"One, two, three."
01:01:02.416,01:01:04.166,"So, what are you most afraid of?"
01:01:08.583,01:01:09.708,Uh...
01:01:15.500,01:01:18.500,I don't know. I guess losing my sister.
01:01:19.416,01:01:20.875,My mom's gone a lot.
01:01:20.958,01:01:22.416,My dad left a while ago.
01:01:23.083,01:01:24.250,"New town, new family."
01:01:25.708,01:01:29.250,"So, Kate's basically all I have."
01:01:38.875,01:01:39.916,How'd you get that?
01:01:47.791,01:01:49.625,I'm going in search of the bottom.
01:02:25.166,01:02:26.208,Finch?
01:02:35.041,01:02:36.000,Finch!
01:02:47.916,01:02:48.875,Finch!
01:03:17.208,01:03:18.083,Asshole!
01:03:18.916,01:03:19.791,What?
01:03:24.541,01:03:26.916,"Hey, Violet. Violet, I'm sorry!"
01:03:32.333,01:03:33.708,"Violet, I'm sorry."
01:03:35.041,01:03:35.875,Violet!
01:03:40.208,01:03:42.625,"I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry."
01:03:42.708,01:03:45.166,I didn't... I didn't mean to scare you.
01:03:45.583,01:03:46.625,"Well, you did."
01:03:47.125,01:03:49.958,That was the last thing that I wanted to do.
01:03:51.500,01:03:53.291,Where do you go when you disappear?
01:04:02.000,01:04:04.125,Tell me something real about you.
01:04:06.208,01:04:07.333,Or I'm leaving.
01:04:07.916,01:04:09.041,OK.
01:04:10.500,01:04:14.000,Sometimes I have to go to places that make me feel like myself.
01:04:14.083,01:04:18.541,I need to do things that remind me that I'm in control.
01:04:26.875,01:04:28.125,My dad used to...
01:04:29.708,01:04:31.208,get in these dark moods.
01:04:37.875,01:04:39.208,Did he do that to you?
01:04:43.958,01:04:45.666,I used to be a lot smaller.
01:04:50.458,01:04:52.791,I used to not know how to get out of the way.
01:04:59.750,01:05:01.541,"People don't like messy, right?"
01:05:51.791,01:05:54.208,"-Oh, wait. Yeah, you got it. -I know, I had it!"
01:06:20.875,01:06:22.208,"-Yeah. No, you got it. -OK."
01:08:06.041,01:08:07.958,"Finch, wake up. We gotta go."
01:08:13.791,01:08:16.208,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My phone died.
01:08:16.291,01:08:17.500,"Violet, inside."
01:08:20.041,01:08:22.208,-If I could explain. Please-- -It's not his fault!
01:08:22.291,01:08:23.166,Just get in the house.
01:08:23.250,01:08:25.166,-We'll talk about it later. -I lost track of time.
01:08:25.250,01:08:29.916,-Finch! -If I could-- I'm so... I'm so sorry.
01:08:30.833,01:08:32.916,It was my fault. I fucked up.
01:08:33.000,01:08:36.708,"Please, just don't blame her. Please. I'm sorry."
01:08:36.791,01:08:38.916,Just... go home.
01:09:45.583,01:09:48.916,"what horrible situations we had you in, in our heads?"
01:09:50.666,01:09:56.791,"You have to understand how that felt, your dad and I not knowing where you were."
01:09:58.750,01:10:00.166,I said I was sorry.
01:10:00.958,01:10:02.875,But you didn't have to treat Finch like that.
01:10:02.958,01:10:05.833,"Well, he's the boy that kept our daughter out all night."
01:10:07.041,01:10:09.125,"I kept him out all night, too, Mom."
01:11:42.041,01:11:42.875,Hey.
01:11:43.250,01:11:45.500,"Hey, V. Hey, what's up?"
01:11:46.250,01:11:47.166,How are you?
01:11:48.000,01:11:49.958,-Fine. -It's been a minute. What's been going on?
01:11:50.041,01:11:51.500,I can't deal with you right now.
01:11:52.833,01:11:54.125,Is everything OK?
01:11:54.916,01:11:56.666,"Honestly, I don't know."
01:11:58.708,01:12:01.875,"I'm not tryin' to be an asshole, but you should know what you're getting into."
01:12:03.333,01:12:05.375,"-I do. -No, you don't."
01:12:05.458,01:12:06.458,-He-- -Let's go.
01:12:07.000,01:12:09.333,-Where've you been? -You know why she's hangin' out with you?
01:12:09.416,01:12:10.500,She's tryin' to fix you.
01:12:10.583,01:12:12.916,"Shut up, Roamer! Just..."
01:12:17.583,01:12:19.958,-Call me a freak one more time. -You're a fuckin' freak.
01:12:24.291,01:12:25.125,Finch!
01:12:27.041,01:12:28.000,Finch!
01:12:30.125,01:12:32.250,"Finch! Yo, let him go, man. Get off him."
01:12:33.791,01:12:35.916,"Finch, stop! Stop!"
01:13:16.875,01:13:17.708,Fuck!
01:13:18.875,01:13:20.625,Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
01:13:37.083,01:13:37.958,Anything?
01:13:42.541,01:13:43.916,Guess he's gone again.
01:13:47.916,01:13:53.333,"I've been friends with the guy since minute one, and I haven't waited for his call in years."
01:13:54.000,01:13:54.958,He just...
01:13:56.541,01:13:58.458,"gets in this mood sometimes, and..."
01:13:59.583,01:14:01.750,"it's hard, you know?"
01:14:03.750,01:14:08.875,"He's not easy, and everybody who gets close to him gets burned out."
01:14:12.750,01:14:14.291,"So, why do you stick around?"
01:14:19.666,01:14:20.750,Because...
01:14:23.916,01:14:24.916,'cause I love him.
01:14:26.875,01:14:30.041,He thinks everybody leaves him and I won't do that.
01:14:32.208,01:14:33.625,This is what we do.
01:14:34.333,01:14:40.041,"I'm gonna get mad, he's gonna come back and apologize, and it'll be like it never even happened."
01:14:51.958,01:14:52.958,Hey.
01:14:54.083,01:14:55.958,Is... is Finch here?
01:14:56.958,01:14:58.250,Did something happen?
01:15:07.458,01:15:14.666,"Um... I'm OCD and just got diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder, so being here with everyone is not intimidating at all."
01:15:17.208,01:15:19.458,"Last year, I started cutting myself."
01:15:20.625,01:15:24.000,"I still deal with it, but I'm here."
01:15:25.250,01:15:26.750,I'm so sorry.
01:15:26.833,01:15:28.125,No worries. Have a seat.
01:15:34.375,01:15:41.000,"Um... I am ADHD, OCD, BPD, DID, and bipolar."
01:15:42.833,01:15:46.458,"Um... you'd think some of those would cancel the others out, but..."
01:15:47.041,01:15:48.666,"Yeah, my week's been OK."
01:15:48.750,01:15:53.291,"I've been watching a lot of basketball lately, and that's been helping a lot, so..."
01:15:54.000,01:15:54.833,Good.
01:15:56.458,01:15:57.916,Hi. Welcome.
01:16:01.875,01:16:02.875,Um...
01:16:05.041,01:16:07.666,"I'm, uh... Theodore Finch."
01:16:09.791,01:16:10.833,No labels.
01:16:17.166,01:16:18.125,Uh...
01:16:20.291,01:16:31.541,"I guess it's 'cause I... I got in this fight at school and, like, I was there, but I wasn't there."
01:16:31.625,01:16:33.625,"I was watchin' myself, and..."
01:16:37.875,01:16:38.833,uh...
01:16:39.458,01:16:41.833,I-I-I just get a little lost sometimes.
01:16:45.000,01:16:47.333,I run... a lot.
01:16:48.041,01:16:49.458,Sometimes that helps.
01:16:51.000,01:16:52.000,Kind of.
01:16:56.250,01:16:57.708,I don't know. Is that enough?
01:16:58.666,01:16:59.541,Sure.
01:17:00.125,01:17:01.750,Thanks. Glad you're here.
01:17:05.458,01:17:07.833,"Amanda, why don't you go ahead?"
01:17:10.166,01:17:11.250,I'm Amanda.
01:17:13.750,01:17:14.791,I'm bulimic.
01:17:16.291,01:17:18.125,I've tried to kill myself twice.
01:17:21.375,01:17:23.291,I think about it almost every day.
01:17:45.458,01:17:48.416,I gotta go to work. I'm gonna be late. But you should stay.
01:17:49.333,01:17:50.750,Why does he keep doing this?
01:17:54.625,01:17:55.708,I don't know.
01:18:00.041,01:18:02.250,"Have him call me when you hear from him, OK?"
01:18:04.041,01:18:04.875,Yeah.
01:18:16.583,01:18:18.083,Why do you keep doing stuff like that?
01:18:18.166,01:18:20.541,Aren't you tired of people talking about you all the time?
01:18:22.166,01:18:23.916,People are always gonna talk.
01:18:24.916,01:18:26.166,It's their specialty.
01:18:29.583,01:18:30.583,Are you OK?
01:18:34.125,01:18:42.166,"I don't know. I feel like I keep messing things up, and I'm not sure I know how to not do that."
01:18:42.625,01:18:43.625,Does this work?
01:18:45.666,01:18:47.458,It's better than the alternative.
01:19:37.708,01:19:39.625,She's been at the house all afternoon.
01:19:43.041,01:19:44.041,What's going on?
01:19:49.083,01:19:52.166,I don't... really remember...
01:19:53.125,01:19:55.250,Dad that well.
01:19:56.833,01:19:58.708,And everything I do...
01:20:01.041,01:20:03.458,remember is... is bad.
01:20:07.208,01:20:08.375,Are there any...
01:20:09.583,01:20:11.750,good memories you have of him?
01:20:14.833,01:20:19.833,"Well, the fact that he would beat the shit out of us kind of negated all the good times."
01:20:26.916,01:20:29.500,But why was he like that?
01:20:29.583,01:20:32.333,Was he like that because of us? Was he...
01:20:33.583,01:20:34.875,like that because of Mom?
01:20:34.958,01:20:37.375,He was like that because he was a shitty person.
01:20:39.916,01:20:43.000,"Because if there's a reason, then he could get better."
01:20:43.083,01:20:44.166,Something or...
01:20:45.500,01:20:48.416,"someone could make him better, right?"
01:20:48.875,01:20:51.875,"I don't know. Who cares? Dude, he's someone else's problem."
01:20:51.958,01:20:54.000,Why are you asking me about Dad?
01:20:57.875,01:20:59.291,"What's going on, Finch?"
01:21:03.541,01:21:05.458,"Come on. You can talk to me, man."
01:21:08.333,01:21:10.125,"Nothing, Kate."
01:21:10.208,01:21:11.291,Sorry. Nothing.
01:21:12.666,01:21:13.666,I'm good.
01:21:14.458,01:21:26.500,"Are you sure? Because I have to open the bar, You know I love you, right, Theo?"
01:21:29.750,01:21:30.666,I know.
01:22:13.791,01:22:14.875,You scared me.
01:22:21.458,01:22:22.916,What is all of this?
01:22:30.916,01:22:32.291,On staying awake.
01:22:34.916,01:22:37.000,I don't understand what that means.
01:22:38.708,01:22:40.166,Sometimes I...
01:22:41.125,01:22:42.333,go blank.
01:22:44.166,01:22:46.875,I... get into these dark moods.
01:22:48.041,01:22:53.041,"I think too fast to keep track of anything, and then it's like..."
01:22:54.208,01:22:57.041,all my thoughts are gone at once.
01:22:58.458,01:23:01.791,"And sometimes, if I put 'em up there, I can..."
01:23:02.208,01:23:04.333,"focus and slow down, but..."
01:23:07.291,01:23:09.791,I can't right now. I can't.
01:23:11.958,01:23:12.958,OK.
01:23:16.000,01:23:17.791,Maybe there's too much clutter.
01:23:21.333,01:23:23.708,I can fix it. I just...
01:23:24.083,01:23:27.000,I just need time to figure this out.
01:23:33.833,01:23:36.541,This is on me! This isn't about you!
01:23:38.833,01:23:40.708,You need to tell me what's wrong.
01:23:44.375,01:23:45.458,You don't get it.
01:23:51.583,01:23:52.666,You're right.
01:23:53.833,01:23:55.083,I don't get it.
01:23:58.416,01:24:00.041,"Don't you know, Violet?"
01:24:03.666,01:24:04.875,I'm The Freak.
01:24:08.916,01:24:10.291,I'm fucked up!
01:24:22.875,01:24:24.000,I need you to leave.
01:24:29.916,01:24:30.875,Go!
01:25:47.750,01:25:49.250,I'm sorry.
01:25:50.250,01:25:51.833,I'm just sorry that I pushed.
01:25:51.916,01:25:53.666,And... I...
01:25:54.916,01:25:56.666,just need you to come back.
01:26:00.958,01:26:03.500,"I just really need you to come back, OK?"
01:26:30.750,01:26:31.916,"Hey, kiddo."
01:26:32.750,01:26:33.625,Hey.
01:26:39.875,01:26:40.833,Dad?
01:26:43.333,01:26:44.166,Yeah?
01:26:48.041,01:26:49.500,On Eleanor's birthday...
01:26:53.958,01:26:54.875,I...
01:26:57.833,01:26:59.250,I wasn't really thinking.
01:27:04.791,01:27:06.708,I found myself at the bridge.
01:27:10.666,01:27:12.416,I was standing on a ledge.
01:27:16.875,01:27:18.583,That's how I met Finch.
01:27:19.666,01:27:20.958,He found me there.
01:27:25.666,01:27:26.875,He saved me.
01:27:29.916,01:27:31.208,You... you weren't gonna...
01:27:31.666,01:27:32.666,I'm OK.
01:27:35.958,01:27:36.958,I was...
01:27:38.166,01:27:39.041,confused.
01:27:41.458,01:27:42.541,I was sad.
01:27:45.458,01:27:46.458,I'm OK.
01:27:50.333,01:27:51.458,I'm better now.
01:27:54.916,01:27:55.750,Wow.
01:27:57.958,01:28:00.000,"Well, I'm glad Finch was there."
01:28:02.875,01:28:03.875,Me too.
01:28:14.750,01:28:15.666,Well...
01:28:18.583,01:28:20.708,you two have been a lot of places.
01:28:21.833,01:28:23.875,Is there any place else he might go?
01:29:54.500,01:29:55.666,Finch!
01:30:00.958,01:30:02.000,Finch!
01:30:05.625,01:30:06.666,Finch.
01:30:34.458,01:30:36.416,Marco!
01:31:56.625,01:31:59.000,I wanna thank you all for being here today.
01:31:59.500,01:32:07.875,We've gathered to celebrate and to honor the memory of one who will be incredibly missed because he has been so dearly loved.
01:32:08.625,01:32:10.541,The events of these past few days...
01:32:47.000,01:32:48.250,I'm gonna say bye.
01:32:48.333,01:32:49.875,"OK, we'll wait for you."
01:33:16.041,01:33:17.541,I should've been there.
01:33:32.500,01:33:33.625,I miss him.
01:33:37.458,01:33:39.500,Just so fucked.
01:33:59.083,01:34:01.041,Sorry that I wasn't there for you.
01:34:04.125,01:34:05.125,It's OK.
01:34:07.375,01:34:08.875,I didn't know how to tell you.
01:34:14.208,01:34:15.375,I would miss you.
01:36:10.083,01:36:15.208,created as a sanctuary for the weary travelers to stop and rest along their way.
01:36:16.500,01:36:21.208,It was built in memoriam to those who have lost their lives in auto accidents...
01:36:26.041,01:36:27.916,and as a place for healing.
01:36:32.208,01:36:40.333,"We remember those who are no longer here, who were taken from us too soon, and who we will always keep in our hearts."
01:37:36.333,01:37:38.041,Things that seemed meaningful...
01:37:39.375,01:37:41.000,were actually meaningless.
01:37:42.166,01:37:43.583,I worried about life.
01:37:47.041,01:37:50.041,I worried about what would happen if I let myself feel again.
01:37:52.583,01:37:54.166,I thought I didn't deserve to.
01:38:01.291,01:38:02.166,Then...
01:38:03.625,01:38:05.166,without really knowing...
01:38:09.500,01:38:10.583,I changed.
01:38:15.333,01:38:18.875,I wasn't worried about what would happen if I lived.
01:38:20.958,01:38:23.291,I was worried about what would happen if I didn't.
01:38:25.625,01:38:26.958,What I would miss.
01:38:28.833,01:38:30.708,I worried about not remembering.
01:38:32.125,01:38:34.333,Not remembering all of the moments...
01:38:46.416,01:38:48.166,...and that's because of Finch.
01:38:52.958,01:38:54.833,Because he taught me to wander.
01:39:03.250,01:39:05.000,to stand on top of the world.
01:39:09.208,01:39:16.666,"That even the ugliest of places can be beautiful, as long as you take the time to look."
01:39:25.166,01:39:27.041,That it's OK to get lost...
01:39:31.083,01:39:32.916,as long as you find your way back.
01:39:40.291,01:39:45.166,"But in learning all of that, I missed seeing something more important..."
01:39:48.625,01:39:49.791,seeing Finch.
01:39:53.416,01:39:55.000,I missed that he was in pain.
01:40:03.708,01:40:08.750,I missed that he was teaching me all along how to move on.
01:40:14.125,01:40:15.583,Finch was a dreamer.
01:40:18.708,01:40:20.458,He dreamt while he was awake.
01:40:23.958,01:40:28.125,"He dreamt of all the beauty in the world, and he made it come to life."
01:40:33.166,01:40:38.583,Finch taught me that there's beauty in the most unexpected of places.
01:40:44.125,01:40:49.500,"And that there are bright places, even in dark times."
01:40:58.041,01:40:59.458,And that if there isn't...
01:41:02.708,01:41:04.750,you can be that bright place...
01:41:06.583,01:41:08.958,with infinite capacities.
